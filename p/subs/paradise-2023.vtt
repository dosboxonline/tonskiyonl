00:18.666 --> 00:20.958
Do you dream of a better life?

00:21.041 --> 00:23.708
A life that you could never afford?

00:24.541 --> 00:27.208
Aeon offers a time donation program

00:27.291 --> 00:30.500
which generously rewards
every donated year of life.

00:31.875 --> 00:34.083
The procedure is minimally invasive

00:34.166 --> 00:37.416
and is carried out daily in our clinics.

00:37.500 --> 00:40.125
Take your DNA test today.

00:40.208 --> 00:43.208
We will find
a matching time recipient for you.

00:44.000 --> 00:44.833
BENJAMIN
AGE 39

00:44.916 --> 00:48.750
More than 200,000 donors
have already given years of lifetime

00:49.958 --> 00:52.208
and made their dreams come true.

00:52.291 --> 00:53.583
EVA
AGE 21

00:54.458 --> 00:58.083
Because at Aeon,
we believe that when you give time,

00:58.166 --> 00:59.750
life gives back.

00:59.833 --> 01:02.500
NKEIRU
AGE 18

01:02.583 --> 01:04.583
Choose your dreams.

01:06.791 --> 01:10.333
And remember, your age
only makes you more beautiful.

01:10.416 --> 01:12.625
ANOUSH
AGE 19

01:13.291 --> 01:16.333
Donate time and start a new life.

01:18.541 --> 01:21.583
Your time. Your chance. Your choice.

01:22.083 --> 01:24.500
Donors must be over 18.
DNA compatibility is required.

01:24.583 --> 01:25.875
Process takes 2-3 days.

01:25.958 --> 01:28.875
Side effects include headaches, fatigue,
disorientation, emotional distress.

01:28.958 --> 01:32.041
For more information, visit aeon.de
or speak to your time donation manager.

01:34.291 --> 01:35.333
Fifteen years?

01:37.458 --> 01:40.916
I was actually thinking
more like three or maybe five.

01:41.750 --> 01:44.208
I know, Denys. It's just an offer.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.333
The sum rises exponentially
with more years.

01:48.416 --> 01:52.291
If you donate 15 years of your life,
you get 700,000 euros.

01:54.250 --> 01:56.875
I mean, I've just turned 18.

01:58.583 --> 02:00.916
I think it's all a bit too much
for me right now.

02:03.541 --> 02:06.208
Mr. Bondar, how long
have you been waiting for your visa?

02:06.916 --> 02:08.125
Since Denys' birth?

02:10.125 --> 02:12.000
Excuse me for being frank, but

02:13.166 --> 02:15.541
you probably won't live
to see that happen.

02:15.625 --> 02:18.541
You are going to die in this dump
or get deported, as will Denys.

02:20.500 --> 02:25.916
But with 700,000 euros, you can get
your whole family out of here, legally.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.250
That's enough capital
to receive citizenship.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Your father wants to open a shop,
doesn't he?

02:34.416 --> 02:35.375
Yes.

02:35.458 --> 02:39.750
How long would you have to work for that?
Fifteen years wouldn't be enough.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.083
I did it myself.

02:48.833 --> 02:50.166
I was about your age.

02:51.166 --> 02:54.791
In my case, it was five years.
That was enough to pay for university.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.541
If you want a better life,

02:59.291 --> 03:00.166
for yourself,

03:01.500 --> 03:02.541
for your family,

03:02.625 --> 03:05.666
then this is like winning the lottery.

03:09.625 --> 03:11.416
How do I explain this to my girl?

03:13.541 --> 03:15.958
You marry her and get her out of here.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.666
Hey. I was just about to call you.

03:45.750 --> 03:48.500
Right. Hey, you're still in the Field?

03:48.583 --> 03:51.750
-You know how important today is.
-Erika, relax.

03:51.833 --> 03:56.000
I was at Denys Bondar's place.
He was about to throw away his big chance.

03:56.083 --> 03:57.041
Max.

03:57.125 --> 04:00.000
Should I help my donors
or hang out at a champagne reception?

04:00.083 --> 04:00.916
Don't push it.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.333
Better hurry.

05:12.208 --> 05:13.625
MY TIME BELONGS TO ME

05:44.750 --> 05:45.833
Max, finally!

05:53.500 --> 05:55.000
I already sent it to you.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.625
Fifteen years!

05:57.708 --> 06:00.000
Quit bragging. You're still late.

06:05.125 --> 06:08.666
One scientist in particular has stood out.

06:08.750 --> 06:11.583
With their latest optimization
in DNA matching,

06:11.666 --> 06:14.708
Dr. Mortensen and his fantastic team

06:14.791 --> 06:18.875
have made life much easier
for our donor scouts.

06:23.583 --> 06:28.250
And now a big round of applause
for our next Aeonian of the Year.

06:28.333 --> 06:30.500
Donation Manager of the Year,

06:30.583 --> 06:32.166
Max Toma!

06:33.875 --> 06:36.666
Congratulations, you bastard.
Now get yourself on that stage.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.833
He has brokered 276 years,

06:42.916 --> 06:45.458
and the quarter isn't even over yet.

06:46.333 --> 06:50.958
But what really makes Max a winner
is his empathy and sincerity.

06:51.041 --> 06:53.041
Donors who had been advised by Max

06:53.125 --> 06:56.083
were almost always willing
to come back to Aeon.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.375
Congratulations.

07:05.125 --> 07:08.833
And now the woman
we've all been waiting for.

07:08.916 --> 07:11.375
The mastermind behind
the chrono transfers,

07:11.458 --> 07:13.708
our CEO, Sophie Theissen!

07:25.458 --> 07:27.708
We're very proud of you all.

07:28.541 --> 07:29.375
Congratulations.

07:30.166 --> 07:31.000
Thank you.

07:36.666 --> 07:38.708
Died at age 35.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.500
What incomparable musical treasures

07:41.583 --> 07:45.666
were forever lost to us
due to his untimely death?

07:46.375 --> 07:50.000
Let's imagine for a moment
that he had lived to be 80,

07:50.083 --> 07:51.125
120,

07:52.291 --> 07:54.125
or even 150 years of age.

07:54.750 --> 07:56.791
Or let's consider Friedrich Schiller,

07:57.375 --> 07:58.250
Frida Kahlo,

07:58.333 --> 08:02.708
Nelson Mandela, Marie Curie.
What more might they have achieved?

08:02.791 --> 08:05.291
In a world where it's no longer age but

08:06.083 --> 08:09.750
people who get to decide
how long they'll contribute to society.

08:10.250 --> 08:12.750
That's why I'm delighted that from today,

08:12.833 --> 08:17.458
we will include any present
and future Nobel Prize winners

08:17.541 --> 08:19.416
in our database of recipients.

08:20.208 --> 08:24.083
As I am talking to you,
the first 15 scientists

08:24.166 --> 08:26.166
have already received their donation.

08:26.750 --> 08:30.041
They're currently recuperating
in our Berlin Chrono Clinic.

08:30.125 --> 08:31.125
Professor.

08:32.375 --> 08:34.000
It's time for your session.

08:34.666 --> 08:40.833
There, our doctors and therapists
are preparing them for their new lives

08:40.916 --> 08:44.625
so that they can continue their research
for many years to come.

08:44.708 --> 08:47.666
Together with Aeon,
in the service of progress.

08:48.166 --> 08:51.375
Sponsored by the Lucy Theissen Foundation.

08:51.458 --> 08:55.666
LUCY THEISSEN FOUNDATION

09:00.666 --> 09:02.083
Take your time.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.583
Get used to what you see.

09:05.166 --> 09:06.875
Your body is now young again.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.583
You look beautiful.

09:12.666 --> 09:15.708
I just don't feel comfortable
getting undressed in front of you.

09:15.791 --> 09:17.791
I'm still the same person.

09:19.291 --> 09:20.250
Hello.

09:20.333 --> 09:21.958
Please, take a seat.

09:23.625 --> 09:26.500
Professor, I see
the rejuvenation was successful.

09:26.583 --> 09:28.208
We can turn back the clock,

09:29.708 --> 09:32.500
but we still can't make it
stand still for good.

09:33.458 --> 09:35.500
So we'll continue our research

09:36.000 --> 09:39.333
until age and death no longer define us,

09:39.833 --> 09:41.333
but the other way around.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.541
The last big step to absolute freedom.

09:46.666 --> 09:49.000
And not just for the top 10,000,

09:50.000 --> 09:52.708
but for all people on this planet.

10:04.333 --> 10:05.166
How do you feel?

10:05.250 --> 10:06.833
I can walk again.

10:07.333 --> 10:08.541
That's amazing.

10:28.416 --> 10:30.625
He executed all 15 patients.

10:32.125 --> 10:34.375
He spared our nursing staff
and the relatives.

10:37.041 --> 10:39.875
This was a targeted terrorist move
by the Adam Group.

10:40.625 --> 10:43.208
The police have already launched
a massive manhunt.

10:43.791 --> 10:45.166
So far without success.

10:45.666 --> 10:48.541
Adam has already claimed responsibility
for the attack.

11:10.833 --> 11:11.708
Turn it off.

11:14.958 --> 11:16.625
How could this happen?

11:18.708 --> 11:22.208
The guy got himself hired
as a nurse months ago.

11:22.791 --> 11:25.666
I'm Nowak,
your new head of operations in Berlin.

11:26.666 --> 11:29.208
His predecessor cleared out
his desk already.

11:29.291 --> 11:32.000
Sixteen years with the Berlin Police
counter-terrorism unit.

11:32.083 --> 11:35.250
First, I'll run a background check
on every employee in Germany

11:35.333 --> 11:36.791
in case there's another mole.

11:36.875 --> 11:40.000
I've already arranged that.
For all employees worldwide.

11:40.083 --> 11:42.625
It might be helpful in the future
if these things--

11:42.708 --> 11:46.000
â€¦these things were discussed without me.
I have to put out a statement.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.750
That's super romantic,

12:16.833 --> 12:19.166
but my husband will be home any minute.

12:20.125 --> 12:21.125
Really?

12:21.958 --> 12:25.750
-I heard he's the jealous type.
-Unattractive men often are.

12:27.625 --> 12:30.416
-I compensate in other ways.
-I saw.

12:31.416 --> 12:33.083
Employee of the Year!

12:34.916 --> 12:36.708
Maybe we can afford
a place by the lake soon.

12:37.625 --> 12:40.708
You're nuts. We haven't even
paid off this apartment yet.

12:41.208 --> 12:43.541
So what? You just call
that nice bank consultant,

12:43.625 --> 12:45.458
and he'll give us another loan.

12:46.583 --> 12:48.625
You have such a good rapport with him.

12:49.583 --> 12:50.458
He just likes me.

12:50.541 --> 12:53.750
Just imagine, a house by the lake.

12:53.833 --> 12:56.750
This is our time.
Let's not wait till we're retired.

12:56.833 --> 12:58.375
Then our kids can enjoy it too.

13:00.958 --> 13:02.125
Our kids, yeah?

13:03.416 --> 13:04.458
That's right.

13:05.625 --> 13:08.291
Shouldn't we tackle that part first, then?

13:09.916 --> 13:12.625
The food is going to take
another seven minutes.

13:13.875 --> 13:15.000
You'll manage.

14:19.041 --> 14:20.375
Try to be nice to him.

14:21.666 --> 14:22.500
I'm always nice.

14:23.166 --> 14:26.208
You guys are crazy! Elli!

14:27.625 --> 14:31.166
But you really didn't have to, sweetie.

14:31.250 --> 14:34.833
-The supermarket's on the way, Mom.
-Are there no shops left here now?

14:34.916 --> 14:38.833
First, they're closing down all feedlots,
then they'll ban meat altogether.

14:38.916 --> 14:41.041
Best that could happen,
with your cholesterol.

14:41.125 --> 14:42.166
Yeah, yeah.

14:44.125 --> 14:45.458
He's smoking again.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.041
And thinks I don't notice.

14:48.125 --> 14:49.166
What about Rudi?

14:49.750 --> 14:53.333
Colleague of mine. Slim and trim,
never smoked, no meat. And now? Dead.

14:53.416 --> 14:56.666
-Heart attack in his early sixties.
-Great argument, Dad.

14:57.250 --> 14:59.375
Not everyone has genes as good as yours.

14:59.875 --> 15:01.416
Now it's the genes.

15:01.500 --> 15:05.458
How is it the poor die earlier and earlier
and the rich get younger and younger?

15:05.541 --> 15:07.291
Is that also decided by genetics?

15:07.375 --> 15:08.791
For the same reason the poor

15:08.875 --> 15:11.541
have a much higher standard of living
than ten years ago.

15:11.625 --> 15:14.125
And what if I wanted to be 20 again

15:14.208 --> 15:17.958
to enjoy my high standard of living?
Could you arrange that for me?

15:18.041 --> 15:20.250
Sure, if you find a compatible donor.

15:20.958 --> 15:22.958
And how much would I have to pay them?

15:23.958 --> 15:25.125
Oh, I forgot.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.500
That costs more
than you can earn in a lifetime.

15:28.583 --> 15:30.541
At least if you have an honest job.

15:31.458 --> 15:33.333
Animals are no longer slaughtered,

15:33.833 --> 15:36.750
but humans are sucked dry.

15:36.833 --> 15:39.208
Many of those "sucked dry"
are better off today.

15:39.291 --> 15:40.333
Instead of the ghetto,

15:40.416 --> 15:43.583
they live in NeukÃ¶lln or Prenzlauer Berg
and have jobs and a family.

15:44.083 --> 15:46.583
I mean, if people have nothing
but their youth,

15:46.666 --> 15:48.458
why forbid them from profiting from it?

15:48.541 --> 15:50.041
All right, that's enough.

15:50.875 --> 15:52.958
-Both of you.
-Yeah, I'll stop talking.

15:54.708 --> 15:56.208
Stefan!

15:58.958 --> 16:00.041
No, I don't agree.

16:00.541 --> 16:04.041
All his life,
he's paid his health insurance.

16:04.125 --> 16:06.583
And now he has to pay
for his medication himself.

16:07.250 --> 16:10.041
You're a doctor. You know
how unhealthy his lifestyle is.

16:10.125 --> 16:12.083
So he has to bear the consequences.

16:12.833 --> 16:13.833
Seriously?

16:15.833 --> 16:17.833
Why do you always take his side?

16:18.583 --> 16:21.125
I'm on your side, always.

16:21.833 --> 16:22.916
You know that.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.083
It'd be nice if you told your father that.

16:26.083 --> 16:27.666
"Yeah, my husband is no saint."

16:27.750 --> 16:30.208
"And Aeon isn't exactly Greenpeace."

16:30.291 --> 16:32.708
"But other donation managers
screw over their donors."

16:32.791 --> 16:35.416
"My husband makes sure
they're compensated fairly."

16:35.500 --> 16:39.208
"He also busts his ass every day
to pay off a fat loan

16:39.291 --> 16:42.500
because his wife works
in a city hospital for a pittance."

16:42.583 --> 16:46.291
So, I'm supposed to tell him
all that next time?

16:50.041 --> 16:51.791
I better write it down, then.

16:52.541 --> 16:53.791
Or you could just say,

16:53.875 --> 16:57.625
"I love him despite him being a small cog
in the capitalist system."

16:57.708 --> 16:58.625
I love him

16:59.875 --> 17:03.708
despite him being a small cog
in the capitalist system.

17:04.250 --> 17:05.291
I love you too.

17:07.625 --> 17:08.541
I know.

17:18.041 --> 17:19.041
What's that?

17:23.791 --> 17:25.291
Shit, that's our building.

17:32.458 --> 17:34.291
Stop! You can't come through here.

17:34.875 --> 17:36.750
-Elli!
-Get back!

17:36.833 --> 17:37.833
We live here.

17:39.541 --> 17:40.416
Shit.

17:47.833 --> 17:49.375
They're just things, okay?

17:50.333 --> 17:52.500
For the insurance company to handle,
that's all.

17:52.583 --> 17:53.916
It's our home.

17:57.916 --> 18:00.041
Your apartment was completely destroyed.

18:01.333 --> 18:03.875
According to the data
transmitted by the fire detector,

18:03.958 --> 18:06.958
the fire wasn't caused by faulty wiring
or something similar.

18:07.041 --> 18:09.666
It was definitely an open flame.

18:10.916 --> 18:12.416
Probably a candle.

18:17.958 --> 18:20.208
I'm sure I extinguished the candles.

18:22.583 --> 18:26.291
Unfortunately, your insurance won't budge.
It's considered negligence.

18:26.791 --> 18:28.541
They won't pay out anything.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.000
So, what are we going to do?

18:30.083 --> 18:31.708
There's not a lot we can do.

18:31.791 --> 18:34.583
Your bank will demand
the mortgage shortfall.

18:36.208 --> 18:37.333
The entire sum.

18:38.750 --> 18:42.166
That's almost 2.5 million.
How are we supposed to pay that?

18:42.708 --> 18:44.791
All our money was in the apartment.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.083
Unfortunately, you only have
that one collateral left.

18:49.958 --> 18:51.041
What collateral?

18:54.250 --> 18:55.541
You didn't tell him?

18:58.625 --> 18:59.500
What?

19:01.250 --> 19:02.250
Told me what?

19:06.125 --> 19:09.041
I put up another collateral back then.

19:09.833 --> 19:12.000
I'm a match.

19:13.916 --> 19:15.541
You put up your lifetime?

19:16.250 --> 19:18.375
The bank consultant said
there wasn't any risk.

19:18.875 --> 19:21.500
Worst case,
we could just sell the apartment.

19:21.583 --> 19:23.708
I can't believe it. How can anyoneâ€¦

19:23.791 --> 19:25.666
And you never even told me?

19:27.333 --> 19:29.416
I wanted the apartment for us.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.458
For our family.

19:30.541 --> 19:32.750
No matter how, we'll work it out.

19:32.833 --> 19:33.833
I am also a match.

19:33.916 --> 19:36.166
I had that checked, Max.

19:36.250 --> 19:39.000
According to Aeon,
there's no match for you in the database.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.750
-But I've already donated.
-I know.

19:41.833 --> 19:44.458
But it seems your recipient died recently.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.125
Elena is the only one
who can still donate.

19:53.833 --> 19:56.250
Two and a half million,
that's approximatelyâ€¦

19:58.583 --> 19:59.416
fortyâ€¦

20:00.458 --> 20:01.500
forty years.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.666
There must be something that can be done.

20:12.708 --> 20:14.666
It's pretty hopeless, I'm afraid.

20:26.958 --> 20:27.916
Elena Toma?

20:32.541 --> 20:34.958
-You need to come with us.
-She hasn't done anything.

20:35.041 --> 20:35.916
Step back, please.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.666
There's an enforcement order against you.

20:38.750 --> 20:41.666
We have reason to believe
you're planning to leave the country.

20:41.750 --> 20:43.291
We just went to see our lawyer.

20:43.375 --> 20:46.708
Just a precautionary measure. My colleague
will accompany you to the car.

20:46.791 --> 20:47.666
Come on.

20:48.166 --> 20:49.125
What?

20:50.541 --> 20:51.416
Elli.

20:53.625 --> 20:55.000
We'll work it out, okay?

20:55.833 --> 20:57.833
We'll work it out. I'll find a way.

21:09.958 --> 21:11.041
Ms. Theissen!

21:14.083 --> 21:16.375
Remember me, Max Toma?

21:17.000 --> 21:18.750
Donation Manager of the Year.

21:19.875 --> 21:21.250
Of course. How are you?

21:21.333 --> 21:22.458
I need a loan.

21:23.458 --> 21:27.208
Two and a half million. I know that's
a lot of money, but I can work it off.

21:27.291 --> 21:30.541
The bank wants to seize
40 years from my wife.

21:31.083 --> 21:33.583
We've tried everything we could
to pay it off, but it'sâ€¦

21:34.375 --> 21:35.666
it's just too much.

21:37.625 --> 21:41.166
Your wife's donation
is being legally enforced, is that right?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.250
Yes, 40 years.

21:44.875 --> 21:48.083
To be honest, you're our last hope.

21:50.458 --> 21:53.833
Send me the documents.
I'll see what I can do for you, okay?

22:04.416 --> 22:07.791
Our customers need to feel
100% safe with us.

22:08.750 --> 22:11.250
Otherwise, our whole business is at risk.

22:11.333 --> 22:13.333
We've already taken measures.

22:13.916 --> 22:15.916
And as far as our business is concerned,

22:16.000 --> 22:19.416
we sell a product that's unique worldwide.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.791
Our quarterly profits are excellent.

22:22.291 --> 22:26.000
And you spent them almost entirely
on research and philanthropy.

22:26.791 --> 22:30.625
We're talking about lost dividends
in the amount of 23 billion euros.

22:30.708 --> 22:32.166
And that's just last year.

22:34.583 --> 22:37.541
Research is what made this company
what it is today.

22:37.625 --> 22:40.875
Yes, that may be true. But the procedure
is virtually perfect now.

22:40.958 --> 22:42.083
Perfect?

22:42.833 --> 22:44.833
We still haven't solved the issue

22:44.916 --> 22:47.541
of donors and recipients
needing to be DNA compatible.

22:47.625 --> 22:51.958
We're still wasting way too many resources
on the search for suitable donors.

22:52.041 --> 22:53.958
That some people will never find.

22:55.500 --> 22:59.041
A minority
with a rare genetic disposition.

23:00.791 --> 23:03.875
Can we justify investing this much
into highly speculative research

23:03.958 --> 23:06.500
just to cover this niche?

23:07.250 --> 23:11.958
The shareholders are concerned that
you might be too biased, Ms. Theissen.

23:13.291 --> 23:14.833
As opposed to you?

23:36.375 --> 23:37.375
Are you ready?

23:38.291 --> 23:39.500
She promised.

23:39.583 --> 23:42.291
Sophie Theissen promised
that she'd get back to me.

23:43.375 --> 23:44.375
Max.

23:44.958 --> 23:48.916
I've been trying to reach her office
every day for weeks. Every day.

24:10.583 --> 24:11.750
Welcome to Aeon.

24:11.833 --> 24:15.208
Luna Ackermann.
We're here to see a patient, Elena Toma.

24:15.291 --> 24:16.625
I'm her lawyer.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.458
Her donation is in two hours.

24:20.541 --> 24:23.166
I can't let her see any visitors
until after the procedure.

24:23.250 --> 24:25.666
I'm from headquarters.
This is about my wife.

24:25.750 --> 24:28.625
No one can see a patient
on the day of an enforced donation.

24:30.166 --> 24:33.333
You're sucking 40 years from her,
and I'm not allowed to see her?

24:33.416 --> 24:34.333
Regulations.

24:34.833 --> 24:35.666
I'm sorry.

24:35.750 --> 24:36.875
Regulations?

24:37.458 --> 24:39.375
Her life will be over after this, asshole!

24:39.458 --> 24:42.750
-Let me see her now!
-Max. This is getting us nowhere.

24:42.833 --> 24:46.041
That's all I ever hear from you.
What are you even here for?

24:53.583 --> 24:55.375
-Max?
-Hey, stop!

24:55.458 --> 24:57.166
Don't move!

25:08.250 --> 25:09.208
Elena?

25:10.333 --> 25:11.291
Elena!

25:16.458 --> 25:17.375
Elena!

25:17.875 --> 25:19.791
Elena! Let go of me!

25:19.875 --> 25:21.833
I just want to see my wife!

25:21.916 --> 25:23.083
Let go of me!

25:23.583 --> 25:26.000
Calm down right now.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.416
Or my colleague will hurt you.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.958
Hey, please! This isn't necessary.

25:33.041 --> 25:35.250
He just wanted to see his wife,
that's all.

25:35.333 --> 25:36.541
Please let him go.

25:36.625 --> 25:37.708
He'll calm down.

25:45.083 --> 25:48.083
We've finally managed
to stop the climate crisis.

25:48.666 --> 25:52.333
Because the richest 5%
invested in green technology.

25:52.416 --> 25:57.125
Because the prospect of living
in this world for much longer

25:57.208 --> 25:59.583
has changed their view
on the climate crisis.

26:00.291 --> 26:03.333
When we change how we see this world,

26:04.000 --> 26:06.458
we also change the world as a result.

26:26.125 --> 26:31.125
You, Ms. Elena Toma, nÃ©e Neumann,
hereafter referred to as "the debtor,"

26:31.208 --> 26:34.250
have had a seizure of assets
issued against you.

26:34.333 --> 26:37.583
The seizure is to be levied
against the debtor's time assets.

26:37.666 --> 26:41.666
As decided by the court,
the amount shall be 38 years.

26:42.333 --> 26:46.666
In accordance with section 863G
of the Civil Procedure Code,

26:46.750 --> 26:49.916
the relevant amount
will be paid to the creditors

26:50.000 --> 26:53.250
as soon as the procedure
has been performed by Aeon Inc.

26:53.958 --> 26:56.916
The People's Republic of China
has long been advocating

26:57.000 --> 26:59.833
for an international ban
on time donations.

26:59.916 --> 27:01.166
What is your opinion?

27:01.250 --> 27:03.416
You cannot stop innovation.

27:04.208 --> 27:09.000
But you can enforce
that innovative technologies

27:09.541 --> 27:11.375
are used responsibly.

27:17.166 --> 27:19.083
No.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.458
No, stop, you can't do this! Release me!

27:22.541 --> 27:25.541
Help!

27:26.125 --> 27:27.250
Help!

27:29.041 --> 27:30.458
You have to help me.

27:30.541 --> 27:32.416
Please!

27:33.500 --> 27:35.416
You have to help me, please!

28:40.500 --> 28:42.583
It's all we can afford right now.

28:52.125 --> 28:53.333
It has started.

29:44.958 --> 29:46.791
Hey. It's all right.

30:38.875 --> 30:41.916
GOOD NEWS FROM THE VERY TOP.
REGARDS, ERIKA

30:42.000 --> 30:46.625
If I have this right,
this is from Sophie Theissen herself.

30:46.708 --> 30:49.166
I've been here ten years,
and she doesn't know my name.

30:49.250 --> 30:50.125
What is she saying?

30:54.166 --> 30:56.166
Congratulations on your promotion.

31:01.041 --> 31:03.083
-You get your own team--
-That's it?

31:04.125 --> 31:07.416
What do you mean, "That's it?"
You now make more than me.

31:07.500 --> 31:11.291
Almost a thousand more per month,
as well as a 35,000 euro bonus.

31:14.166 --> 31:16.541
You really think
I want to work here a moment longer?

31:37.583 --> 31:38.583
Ms. Theissen?

31:41.708 --> 31:42.958
Ms. Theissen is busy.

31:43.041 --> 31:44.291
She knows me. Sheâ€¦

31:47.250 --> 31:49.500
Hey! You promised you'd help me.

31:50.041 --> 31:51.458
Step back right now

31:51.541 --> 31:54.000
or this will impact your future here.

33:05.541 --> 33:06.375
Elli?

33:43.625 --> 33:44.666
Best I can do.

33:55.166 --> 33:56.500
I love you.

34:07.958 --> 34:09.291
We'll work it out.

34:23.625 --> 34:24.666
I can't.

34:27.416 --> 34:28.416
Just look at us.

34:31.916 --> 34:32.875
It's ridiculous.

34:36.041 --> 34:37.125
I love you.

34:37.958 --> 34:39.375
-No matter--
-No matter how old I am?

34:40.958 --> 34:42.166
What is this anyway?

34:43.333 --> 34:44.333
Pity?

34:45.208 --> 34:46.875
What? No.

34:47.458 --> 34:50.083
Then what? Your guilty conscience?

34:50.166 --> 34:51.291
Are you crazy?

34:53.375 --> 34:54.583
Your life goes on.

34:55.083 --> 34:56.958
It's me who paid the price, not you.

34:57.791 --> 35:00.250
-That's not my fault.
-Leave me alone.

35:01.083 --> 35:02.083
Leave me alone!

35:04.625 --> 35:06.458
-Elli.
-Just leave me alone.

35:48.958 --> 35:49.958
Rough day?

35:56.958 --> 35:59.500
To help you relax. Because you're so sad.

36:01.041 --> 36:02.208
Piss off.

36:02.291 --> 36:04.458
No reason to be an asshole.

36:22.125 --> 36:23.833
We were able to stop the bleeding.

36:25.083 --> 36:28.166
But we're still waiting for the results
of the hemogram.

36:32.125 --> 36:35.833
How can you withdraw 40 years at once?
That's completely irresponsible.

36:36.333 --> 36:38.750
You shouldn't have left
the transfer clinic so soon.

36:38.833 --> 36:42.458
Not after such a serious procedure
and given her condition.

36:43.291 --> 36:44.375
What condition?

36:49.750 --> 36:51.166
Elena had a miscarriage.

36:54.250 --> 36:57.000
Unfortunately, it happens a lot
with time donations.

37:00.791 --> 37:01.791
You were pregnant?

37:22.250 --> 37:23.583
There's just no point.

37:26.083 --> 37:28.458
You belong with me,
no matter how old your body is.

37:28.541 --> 37:31.541
Max, this isn't about the gray hair
or the wrinkles.

37:35.875 --> 37:37.750
We wanted to watch our kids grow up.

37:40.125 --> 37:42.125
Hold our grandchildren
in our laps one day.

37:43.750 --> 37:45.875
And we wanted to grow old together.

37:47.375 --> 37:48.208
Both of us.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.250
Now I grew old by myself.

37:53.375 --> 37:54.250
But youâ€¦

37:55.750 --> 37:58.000
you still have your life ahead of you.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.500
My Elli.

38:45.708 --> 38:47.333
You don't have to come inside.

38:58.291 --> 38:59.708
It can be reversed.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.833
I know who the recipient was.
I'll make them reverse it.

39:06.250 --> 39:08.791
How? Nothing illegal has happened.

39:08.875 --> 39:11.625
That's how it works, isn't it?
Your system.

39:14.250 --> 39:15.125
Fuck the system.

39:33.083 --> 39:34.708
Give me tenâ€¦

39:36.708 --> 39:38.125
No problem. Mama's got it all.

39:39.500 --> 39:40.333
Thanks.

40:17.833 --> 40:19.625
Better not even start with that.

40:21.625 --> 40:22.666
Stunts your growth.

40:23.791 --> 40:24.875
Want something after all?

40:26.916 --> 40:27.875
Where'd you get it done?

40:28.791 --> 40:30.375
That cute baby face.

40:31.541 --> 40:33.208
It certainly wasn't at Aeon.

40:33.750 --> 40:35.625
Don't worry, I just want a contact.

40:39.041 --> 40:41.375
We have received the 30,000 euros.

40:41.875 --> 40:44.500
Dr. Berg is expecting you next week.

40:44.583 --> 40:47.458
As soon as you've crossed
the border into Lithuania,

40:47.541 --> 40:50.958
you'll contact him
via an unregistered pre-paid phone.

40:51.791 --> 40:54.833
You will then be given
the coordinates to the clinic.

40:54.916 --> 40:57.541
These will be valid for exactly six hours.

40:57.625 --> 41:01.166
If you don't show up,
our agreement is void.

41:13.250 --> 41:15.666
Since the attacks
on several Nobel Prize laureates

41:15.750 --> 41:18.458
in a Berlin Aeon clinic a few weeks ago,

41:18.541 --> 41:21.625
Lilith, the leader of the Adam Group,

41:21.708 --> 41:25.041
has been at the top
of every international wanted list.

41:25.125 --> 41:27.666
Nothing is known about her whereabouts.

41:27.750 --> 41:31.708
However, our reporter
has managed to contact her,

41:31.791 --> 41:34.500
and she has agreed to an interview.

41:34.583 --> 41:39.791
You say that terrorism is the continuation
of dedicated lobbying by other means.

41:39.875 --> 41:42.875
Is that not a simplistic justification
for violence?

41:56.166 --> 41:58.916
Convoy on standby.
Sophie Theissen is leaving the building.

41:59.625 --> 42:04.750
In the United States, prison sentences
can now be offset via a time donation.

42:04.833 --> 42:08.625
Isn't that preferable
to incarcerating an offender for years

42:08.708 --> 42:10.625
at the taxpayer's expense?

42:27.083 --> 42:30.625
People well-versed in the Bible
associate the names Lilith and Adam

42:30.708 --> 42:33.875
with the wrathful God
of the Old Testament.

42:33.958 --> 42:35.833
Are you assuming his role?

42:43.708 --> 42:47.375
The number of time donations
has more than doubled since last year,

42:47.458 --> 42:49.791
despite your terrorist activities.

42:49.875 --> 42:51.666
And it hasn't stopped me either.

43:13.125 --> 43:17.750
LAZARUS CEMETERY
BERLIN

43:28.916 --> 43:32.000
-Wait here, please. I want to be alone.
-As you wish.

44:31.125 --> 44:33.583
Help!

45:26.041 --> 45:27.416
Probably a stroke.

45:27.500 --> 45:30.000
-Pre-existing conditions?
-None on record.

45:30.083 --> 45:32.125
His donation was only three months ago.

45:32.208 --> 45:34.625
It probably hasn't clicked
that he's not 30 anymore.

45:34.708 --> 45:35.958
I'll take over.

45:37.250 --> 45:39.458
-Theater 2 just became available.
-Let me do it.

45:39.541 --> 45:41.291
Don't overdo it, Elli.

45:42.541 --> 45:44.083
Your shift is almost over anyway.

45:50.125 --> 45:51.000
Elli?

45:52.625 --> 45:53.458
Elli.

45:53.541 --> 45:55.916
-We need to talk. Come with me.
-Oh, Max.

45:56.666 --> 45:58.458
-Listen to me.
-What for?

45:58.541 --> 46:00.791
Let it go. Please.

46:01.500 --> 46:03.208
Try to accept the situation.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.500
What if I've found a way?

46:11.458 --> 46:12.291
Trust me.

46:13.500 --> 46:14.666
One last time.

46:26.541 --> 46:30.416
CAR SERVICE E-CONVERSION

46:42.625 --> 46:44.583
Here. Put this on.

46:49.291 --> 46:50.208
Come on.

47:02.625 --> 47:04.041
This is Sophie Theissen.

47:04.833 --> 47:06.916
This woman stole 40 years from you.

47:07.708 --> 47:09.083
We're taking them back.

47:18.500 --> 47:20.750
Thanks. I owe you.

47:28.458 --> 47:29.958
They think it was Adam?

47:31.041 --> 47:32.541
Pretty clear indication.

47:33.125 --> 47:35.250
And you? Do you think so too?

47:35.333 --> 47:38.000
Normally, they only do executions.
Kidnapping is new.

47:39.500 --> 47:40.833
What else do they have?

47:41.583 --> 47:45.041
Traffic surveillance has
a car from Berlin Cars at the cemetery.

47:45.125 --> 47:46.958
Around the back there.

47:47.041 --> 47:49.375
Booked with a fake account
that can't be traced.

47:49.458 --> 47:53.916
But that same account
has been used before, at Tempelhof Field.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.916
I've checked our database.

47:56.000 --> 47:59.208
Look who just happened to enter
the Field at that same time

47:59.291 --> 48:00.916
using an Aeon ID.

48:04.833 --> 48:06.250
Have his work phone tracked.

48:06.333 --> 48:09.166
Forget it.
Our Employee of the Year isn't stupid.

48:09.666 --> 48:11.958
But once you've got a face,

48:12.458 --> 48:13.916
you can find anyone.

48:18.041 --> 48:19.541
You're better than I thought.

48:21.666 --> 48:23.375
Have you lost your mind?

48:23.875 --> 48:25.500
It's the only way.

48:25.583 --> 48:26.583
No!

48:27.458 --> 48:28.291
It's madness.

48:28.375 --> 48:29.875
I've arranged everything.

48:29.958 --> 48:32.166
But we need to get out of Germany
right now.

48:32.666 --> 48:36.291
I packed you some clothes.
You have to leave your phone here too.

48:36.375 --> 48:38.750
I'm not gonna be part of it. No way.

48:40.041 --> 48:41.083
And then what?

48:43.125 --> 48:44.583
Just keep going on like this?

48:45.416 --> 48:48.166
Slave away at the hospital
till you're so exhausted you'll die?

48:56.041 --> 48:58.208
What are you going to do
after the operation?

49:00.666 --> 49:01.750
Kill Theissen?

49:03.500 --> 49:04.583
We'll start over.

49:06.208 --> 49:09.291
-Far from here. Somewhere by the sea.
-Max, we aren't teenagers.

49:09.375 --> 49:10.833
If we get caught,

49:11.333 --> 49:13.541
it won't just be my life that's over

49:14.375 --> 49:15.875
but yours as well.

49:20.541 --> 49:21.458
Yeah.

49:41.875 --> 49:43.208
So we meet again.

49:47.833 --> 49:48.833
You're right.

49:49.416 --> 49:51.125
Our old life is over either way.

49:53.250 --> 49:57.250
So, am I going to prison for this woman
or are you coming with me?

50:14.458 --> 50:16.166
Have we informed the police?

50:17.166 --> 50:18.166
What for?

51:10.375 --> 51:11.375
We'll get them.

51:11.958 --> 51:14.791
Cut the platitudes. I've been doing this
a lot longer than you.

51:16.333 --> 51:17.625
Shit!

51:34.958 --> 51:36.000
Your new life.

51:42.083 --> 51:43.416
You've surprised me.

51:48.166 --> 51:49.500
I've surprised myself.

51:55.416 --> 51:57.208
It's good for anywhere but airports.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
Erika?

52:01.875 --> 52:03.041
Seriously?

52:07.041 --> 52:11.541
ROSTOCK HARBOR

52:26.208 --> 52:28.208
If the police knew about thisâ€¦

52:39.250 --> 52:40.750
This might take a while.

52:42.791 --> 52:43.916
Coffee?

52:48.041 --> 52:50.875
Do you know how Max Toma met his wife?

52:52.625 --> 52:55.083
He was assigned to be
her donation manager.

52:55.166 --> 52:59.458
But instead of persuading her to donate,
they fell in love and got married.

53:00.166 --> 53:01.250
How romantic.

53:01.750 --> 53:05.500
Yes. Until their home burns down
and they're trapped by debt.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.416
I know that we're not dealing
with terrorists here

53:08.500 --> 53:11.041
but with two people who are desperate.

53:11.125 --> 53:14.458
If you were Elena Toma,
how would you feel?

53:14.541 --> 53:17.250
Your life gets taken from you
and given to a billionaire.

53:17.750 --> 53:19.666
'Cause perhaps you left a candle burning.

53:19.750 --> 53:23.750
Nobody forced this woman to mortgage
her lifetime for a luxury apartment.

53:23.833 --> 53:26.666
"Your time. Your chance. Your choice."

53:27.583 --> 53:30.208
They wouldn't be the first
to fall for something like that.

53:30.291 --> 53:32.416
That gives them the right
to kidnap someone?

53:32.500 --> 53:34.208
To take the law into their own hands?

53:34.291 --> 53:35.125
What about us?

53:36.041 --> 53:38.458
Illegal software,
off-the-record operations.

53:39.500 --> 53:41.750
Europe's richest woman
plays by different rules?

53:41.833 --> 53:45.416
We are responsible for the security
of the Theissens, not for world peace.

53:48.750 --> 53:51.708
If you have a problem with that,
why are you with us?

53:56.291 --> 53:57.916
In the end, it's always the money.

53:59.541 --> 54:00.541
The coffee.

54:02.041 --> 54:03.375
The nice company.

54:07.750 --> 54:08.791
How about you?

54:11.250 --> 54:14.708
I started working as a bodyguard
for Sophie Theissen over 30 years ago.

54:15.666 --> 54:17.000
I owe her a lot.

54:21.208 --> 54:24.250
Apparently, more than one would guess
at first glance.

54:25.708 --> 54:27.750
Chronologically, I am 64.

54:27.833 --> 54:31.041
Sophie Theissen needs people
she can trust implicitly.

54:31.125 --> 54:34.291
And the rejuvenation treatment
comes as a bonus.

54:35.250 --> 54:38.041
Well, at least now
you don't need to be upset

54:38.125 --> 54:40.458
that your superior is younger than you.

54:41.666 --> 54:43.208
That's a load off my mind.

55:12.041 --> 55:15.083
I had resigned myself
to the fact that my life was over.

55:17.208 --> 55:18.416
Our life.

55:21.708 --> 55:23.041
And now you come along

55:24.416 --> 55:25.750
and tell me there's hope.

55:51.125 --> 55:52.625
Well, fuck me.

56:25.166 --> 56:26.166
We won't harmâ€¦

56:28.333 --> 56:30.458
We won't kill you if you keep quiet.

56:45.416 --> 56:47.500
You're already doing that better than Dad.

56:48.500 --> 56:49.916
Let's do it differently. There.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.375
Emilia, look how sweet she's sleeping.

56:59.208 --> 57:00.916
Don't go too far, Emilia, all right?

57:03.291 --> 57:07.208
Mom, Dad! Look at the lights!

57:10.958 --> 57:12.291
Come back here, honey.

57:23.208 --> 57:24.541
Is that because of us?

57:25.375 --> 57:26.875
Shit, I don't know.

57:27.833 --> 57:29.166
Who else would it be for?

57:31.416 --> 57:32.833
We still have the passports.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.333
Those won't help
if they go all out like this.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.208
So, this is it, then?

57:54.333 --> 57:58.166
KLAIPÄ–DA TRANSIT PORT
LITHUANIA

59:30.166 --> 59:31.458
How do I open this again?

59:32.416 --> 59:33.958
Push, then turn to the right.

59:55.083 --> 59:56.666
Help!

01:00:19.166 --> 01:00:20.458
Tell him you're just the driver.

01:00:37.875 --> 01:00:39.041
What's the problem?

01:00:39.833 --> 01:00:41.250
Well, the guy is tense.

01:00:48.125 --> 01:00:49.291
Okay, have a good trip.

01:00:52.291 --> 01:00:53.416
Take a deep breath.

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:56.750
Just smile and tell them
you're not used to this stress.

01:01:10.416 --> 01:01:12.291
How many times do I have to tell you?

01:01:12.375 --> 01:01:15.500
Don't point your gun in people's faces.

01:01:43.625 --> 01:01:46.666
It's all right, Emilia.
You're doing good, okay?

01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:47.708
Can we go now?

01:01:48.708 --> 01:01:49.708
Your phones.

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:51.708
Phones!

01:01:53.666 --> 01:01:55.458
I'll just get the phone, okay?

01:02:07.958 --> 01:02:08.958
I'm sorry.

01:02:52.833 --> 01:02:53.916
We had no choice.

01:02:57.583 --> 01:02:58.458
Yeah.

01:03:16.166 --> 01:03:18.416
We should check on her.
She's not doing well.

01:03:20.125 --> 01:03:22.791
We can't stop.
They're going to call the police.

01:03:23.458 --> 01:03:25.125
We need to get off the main road.

01:03:26.541 --> 01:03:27.416
And then?

01:03:28.291 --> 01:03:30.000
We wait for the doctor to contact us.

01:03:52.083 --> 01:03:54.000
What do you want from me anyway?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.750
We're just taking back what's ours.
Then we'll let you go.

01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:01.416
-You can have anything. My mom will pay.
-Your mom?

01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:03.916
Sophie Theissen.

01:04:04.916 --> 01:04:06.500
You are Sophie Theissen.

01:04:06.583 --> 01:04:09.916
What? I'm Marie Theissen, her daughter.

01:04:15.333 --> 01:04:16.166
She's lying.

01:04:17.291 --> 01:04:20.583
My mother keeps me out of the public eye,
for reasons just like this.

01:04:23.833 --> 01:04:26.083
SOPHIE THEISSEN DAUGHTER

01:04:26.166 --> 01:04:27.000
You see?

01:04:27.916 --> 01:04:29.500
This is Theissen's daughter.

01:04:29.583 --> 01:04:31.791
She died more than ten years ago
from progeria.

01:04:31.875 --> 01:04:33.708
That's my older sister, Lucy.

01:04:35.791 --> 01:04:38.250
Listen, my mother and I
have always looked alike.

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:40.000
-But after this damn donation--
-Be quiet!

01:04:40.083 --> 01:04:43.250
Didn't she have an ID,
a driver's license, a phone?

01:04:43.333 --> 01:04:44.916
Of course I did. My bag.

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.166
Which was left at the cemetery.

01:04:47.666 --> 01:04:48.791
And she knows that.

01:04:49.958 --> 01:04:53.125
-Well done on that convincing performance.
-No! Please!

01:04:53.208 --> 01:04:56.208
My mother will pay anything!
I'm telling the truth, please!

01:05:14.208 --> 01:05:15.250
We have to be certain.

01:05:19.625 --> 01:05:20.666
And how?

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:24.791
Call Aeon and ask nicely
if we got the right one?

01:05:25.291 --> 01:05:28.958
So her people can track us down?
That's exactly what she wants.

01:05:29.041 --> 01:05:31.125
Theissen would claim anything
to save her skin!

01:05:32.041 --> 01:05:33.666
We're sticking to the plan.

01:05:34.416 --> 01:05:35.625
What plan?

01:05:37.208 --> 01:05:39.125
Why hasn't Dr. Berg contacted us?

01:05:39.958 --> 01:05:43.458
What if he tricked you
and was just after your money?

01:05:43.541 --> 01:05:45.833
And how much longer
can she lie back there?

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:48.541
She's dehydrated and hypothermic.

01:05:49.958 --> 01:05:51.333
We need a hiding place.

01:06:24.708 --> 01:06:26.083
Why is there no one here?

01:06:26.166 --> 01:06:27.666
Tourism has completely collapsed

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:30.125
since the Baltic States
left the European Union.

01:06:31.875 --> 01:06:33.791
An entire hotel to ourselves.

01:06:36.375 --> 01:06:37.916
Probably totally normal for Theissen.

01:06:52.583 --> 01:06:57.083
Anyway, it beats the hotel in Tuscany
you booked back then.

01:07:08.416 --> 01:07:09.666
It really hurts.

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:22.083
-Don't go overboard.
-We don't have to act like assholes.

01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:27.083
You're the one who sold 40 years
to my mother, right?

01:07:27.833 --> 01:07:30.791
Stop playing games.
You know it was a debt enforcement.

01:07:31.541 --> 01:07:33.083
Don't let her play you.

01:07:33.666 --> 01:07:35.666
I'm against those donations too.

01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:39.875
What happened to you
happens to so many people.

01:07:39.958 --> 01:07:42.500
What about the refugees
that go missing from the camps,

01:07:42.583 --> 01:07:43.958
for example at the EU borders?

01:07:44.583 --> 01:07:47.416
Even children get sold
by their own parents there.

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:51.208
Not to Aeon, of course,
but to illegal Eastern Bloc clinics,

01:07:51.291 --> 01:07:54.958
so third-rate celebs and influencers
can rejuvenate themselves on the cheap.

01:07:55.041 --> 01:07:57.125
Are you trying to make me feel guilty now?

01:07:57.625 --> 01:07:59.833
-You of all people?
-No.

01:07:59.916 --> 01:08:03.458
I'm trying to tell you
that I'm on the same side as you.

01:08:03.541 --> 01:08:05.875
For years, I've been trying
to persuade my mother--

01:08:08.833 --> 01:08:11.083
Please, you have to believe me.
I'm telling--

01:08:11.166 --> 01:08:12.375
No.

01:08:12.458 --> 01:08:13.916
I'll be quiet.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.583
-Whose side are you on here?
-"Whose side"?

01:08:22.666 --> 01:08:23.708
I'm doing this for you.

01:08:24.291 --> 01:08:25.375
For you.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.375
We don't even know
if you kidnapped the right woman.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.750
Even if it is her daughter,

01:08:35.375 --> 01:08:37.583
it's likely she's compatible with you.

01:08:38.166 --> 01:08:40.500
First-degree relatives
are almost always a match.

01:08:40.583 --> 01:08:42.083
We can still use her.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:44.916
"Use her."

01:08:45.541 --> 01:08:48.208
She can get it back from her mom.

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:51.000
They can settle that between themselves.
Not our problem.

01:08:51.083 --> 01:08:55.833
The consequences of what we're doing here
are absolutely our problem.

01:08:56.666 --> 01:08:57.625
So we let her go.

01:08:57.708 --> 01:09:00.916
It's only your life. She still has hers.
Maybe she also wants a child.

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:09.958
You've changed.

01:09:13.166 --> 01:09:14.041
So have you.

01:09:36.708 --> 01:09:38.416
Is there running water here?

01:09:40.458 --> 01:09:41.875
I'd like to wash myself.

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:44.333
Please.

01:09:50.666 --> 01:09:51.666
Wait.

01:09:59.083 --> 01:10:00.125
Thanks.

01:10:07.916 --> 01:10:11.875
She just wanted to help Lucy.
My mom. That's how it all started.

01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:14.458
With her research into cell aging.

01:10:14.958 --> 01:10:17.166
She made groundbreaking discoveries.

01:10:17.916 --> 01:10:21.541
But she still couldn't find
a match for Lucy in time.

01:11:02.916 --> 01:11:03.875
No.

01:11:27.666 --> 01:11:28.583
Damn.

01:11:58.708 --> 01:12:00.291
Hello? Who is this?

01:12:00.375 --> 01:12:02.833
Kaya, you have to get me out of--

01:12:03.666 --> 01:12:06.416
No.

01:12:07.416 --> 01:12:08.250
Shit.

01:12:29.541 --> 01:12:30.541
Help!

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:32.708
Help!

01:12:33.291 --> 01:12:34.875
-Help!
-Grab this.

01:12:37.875 --> 01:12:38.958
With both hands.

01:12:59.666 --> 01:13:00.500
Thank you.

01:13:10.083 --> 01:13:11.000
Leave us alone.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.166
-Are you sure?
-Look at her.

01:14:35.166 --> 01:14:36.708
Any news from your doctor?

01:14:45.125 --> 01:14:47.000
And what about Theissen?

01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:52.541
She wanted to wash up,
and I didn't want to be an asshole.

01:14:52.625 --> 01:14:53.625
Of course not.

01:14:56.041 --> 01:14:57.541
Are you angry with me?

01:14:57.625 --> 01:14:58.541
No.

01:14:59.083 --> 01:15:00.000
Why? Should I be?

01:15:02.458 --> 01:15:04.750
-After all I've done for you?
-For me?

01:15:05.708 --> 01:15:08.125
Whether I wanted this
didn't interest you at all.

01:15:12.416 --> 01:15:13.375
Yeah, sure.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.750
I'm not doing this for you,
for us, our child.

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:19.541
I really don't know what you want from me.

01:15:23.541 --> 01:15:26.041
She doesn't have a scar
from the operation.

01:15:30.291 --> 01:15:31.541
That's what's worrying you?

01:15:32.125 --> 01:15:35.375
Her skin regenerates during rejuvenation.
That's normal.

01:15:36.333 --> 01:15:39.583
Elli, she's manipulating both of us

01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:41.666
by acting all innocent.

01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:46.750
You know what went through my mind
as I saw her sinking?

01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:53.000
"If she dies, it was all for nothing."

01:15:56.041 --> 01:15:57.500
"She's my only chance."

01:15:58.541 --> 01:16:00.458
And if we have the wrong personâ€¦

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:04.208
Maybe I don't even want to know.

01:16:05.208 --> 01:16:07.208
And that's what scares me so much.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.958
Elli, it's you who's the wrong person.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.416
You don't deserve this.

01:16:15.916 --> 01:16:16.875
Weâ€¦

01:16:17.625 --> 01:16:19.750
we still have our lives ahead of us.

01:17:20.208 --> 01:17:22.625
-We managed to locate them.
-Finally.

01:17:22.708 --> 01:17:26.375
Burner phone with a dynamic provider.
Always takes a while.

01:17:27.166 --> 01:17:29.333
They're still in Lithuania, near Å klÄ—riai.

01:17:29.416 --> 01:17:31.583
That's at the border to Belarus.

01:17:32.166 --> 01:17:33.583
130 kilometers from here.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.500
You sure we don't need combat helicopters?

01:18:11.666 --> 01:18:12.708
Easy now.

01:18:15.541 --> 01:18:17.875
If you have weapons,
now would be a good time.

01:18:19.333 --> 01:18:21.416
-Under the pillow.
-Classic.

01:18:28.416 --> 01:18:29.375
Who are you?

01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:32.250
Aeon?

01:19:05.916 --> 01:19:09.958
What if the Tomas aren't impressed
by our little private army?

01:19:10.708 --> 01:19:13.708
I'm getting Marie out of there alive,
no matter how.

01:19:16.666 --> 01:19:18.916
So, are we going to dig some graves today?

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.833
Deep in the Lithuanian no man's land.

01:19:21.958 --> 01:19:23.375
You really think I'd do that?

01:19:25.333 --> 01:19:27.541
I'm wondering whether I could do it.

01:19:28.125 --> 01:19:30.541
Whether I could live with the ghosts.

01:19:35.291 --> 01:19:36.791
It's not easy.

01:19:41.958 --> 01:19:43.708
I never wanted a longer life.

01:19:45.708 --> 01:19:47.458
I just wanted to be fit for the job.

01:19:47.958 --> 01:19:49.458
Youth, itâ€¦

01:19:50.375 --> 01:19:52.375
it sounds so tempting, butâ€¦

01:19:53.666 --> 01:19:57.125
youth alone
doesn't make life better or happier.

01:19:59.708 --> 01:20:00.875
Just longer.

01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:03.083
And full of ghosts?

01:20:04.875 --> 01:20:09.208
After so long in the private sector,
you forget the reason you started out.

01:20:12.625 --> 01:20:13.708
There's a trick.

01:20:15.333 --> 01:20:16.666
It's called an anchor.

01:20:17.666 --> 01:20:19.625
Every time I'm in doubt,

01:20:19.708 --> 01:20:20.750
I do this.

01:20:23.916 --> 01:20:26.500
It reminds me of the reason I started out.

01:20:28.375 --> 01:20:29.375
Justice.

01:20:34.208 --> 01:20:35.125
What about you?

01:20:36.666 --> 01:20:38.250
For money?

01:20:38.333 --> 01:20:39.375
For youth?

01:20:40.125 --> 01:20:41.125
Sophie Theissen?

01:20:46.958 --> 01:20:49.458
We're here to free an innocent woman.

01:20:50.041 --> 01:20:52.125
But after that, you'll buy me a drink.

01:20:55.291 --> 01:20:56.791
You don't give up, do you?

01:20:58.333 --> 01:21:00.000
All right, then. One drink.

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:01.833
When this is over.

01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:04.666
Down.

01:22:08.958 --> 01:22:09.916
What?

01:23:58.083 --> 01:23:59.166
What?

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:08.166
That's sick. I'm not gonna do it.

01:24:29.791 --> 01:24:31.500
Please.

01:24:45.666 --> 01:24:47.625
Please! Please don't!

01:24:49.416 --> 01:24:50.583
Please.

01:24:55.166 --> 01:24:56.000
Please.

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:28.541
What?

01:25:44.208 --> 01:25:46.791
Sophie Theissen herself
will soon arrive here.

01:25:47.708 --> 01:25:49.125
She'll want to talk to you.

01:25:49.625 --> 01:25:51.083
That's what our source says.

01:25:52.708 --> 01:25:53.958
You'll bring her in,

01:25:55.333 --> 01:25:56.833
without her guard dogs.

01:26:01.333 --> 01:26:02.708
We're just the bait.

01:26:03.375 --> 01:26:05.041
You want to kill Sophie Theissen.

01:26:55.166 --> 01:26:56.375
You've got this.

01:27:15.416 --> 01:27:16.958
Marie Theissen is alive.

01:27:18.541 --> 01:27:21.333
As long as nothing happens to me,
nothing will happen to her.

01:27:23.541 --> 01:27:25.750
I want to talk to Sophie Theissen.

01:27:26.416 --> 01:27:27.541
Nobody else.

01:27:28.791 --> 01:27:30.416
Sophie Theissen.

01:28:17.333 --> 01:28:18.875
My wife's age suits you.

01:28:20.125 --> 01:28:21.125
Mr. Toma,

01:28:21.833 --> 01:28:25.708
I understand why you feel that
your wife's situation is an injustice.

01:28:26.291 --> 01:28:29.333
From your point of view,
I understand why you did what you did.

01:28:30.083 --> 01:28:33.791
My daughter is innocent.
More than anyone else in this situation.

01:28:33.875 --> 01:28:37.416
I assume you don't want
to hurt innocent people.

01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:39.041
Only if I'm forced to.

01:28:39.125 --> 01:28:39.958
Good.

01:28:41.041 --> 01:28:43.958
I'm prepared to pay a second time
for your wife's years.

01:28:44.916 --> 01:28:45.958
Ten million.

01:28:46.041 --> 01:28:48.833
That's more than anyone
in your position could hope for.

01:28:49.625 --> 01:28:51.708
You can start a new life with that.

01:28:52.458 --> 01:28:54.750
Maybe you'll even find a donor.

01:28:54.833 --> 01:28:55.958
I already have one.

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.708
I'm Donation Manager of the Year.

01:29:08.250 --> 01:29:10.041
I know how these conversations go.

01:29:11.208 --> 01:29:15.000
How you list the advantages of a donation
as if people could only profit from it.

01:29:15.916 --> 01:29:18.500
But you always know
you're the one with all the pull.

01:29:19.625 --> 01:29:21.583
That you're holding all the aces.

01:29:24.083 --> 01:29:26.791
And those poor suckers
sitting across from you,

01:29:28.416 --> 01:29:29.708
they only have their lives.

01:29:33.375 --> 01:29:36.375
We have your daughter,
and you have my wife's 40 years.

01:29:37.125 --> 01:29:40.041
If you give those back,
we won't need anything from Marie.

01:29:40.833 --> 01:29:41.833
If you don't,

01:29:42.708 --> 01:29:45.041
then we have nothing left to lose.
Your call.

01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:49.833
How do I know Marie's alive
and doing well?

01:29:51.625 --> 01:29:52.583
She's not doing well.

01:29:53.875 --> 01:29:55.208
But she's still alive.

01:29:55.916 --> 01:29:57.916
You're welcome to check for yourself.

01:29:58.625 --> 01:29:59.625
In person.

01:30:00.458 --> 01:30:03.125
Sophie Theissen isn't entering
that building without me.

01:30:05.458 --> 01:30:08.666
The very moment
any third party crosses that doorstep,

01:30:09.666 --> 01:30:11.291
my wife will pull the trigger.

01:30:11.375 --> 01:30:13.458
Then we'll phone Marie from here.

01:30:14.708 --> 01:30:15.791
Forget it.

01:30:17.208 --> 01:30:19.166
I know who I'm dealing with here.

01:30:20.125 --> 01:30:24.416
With people who stop at nothing,
who commit arson and arrange accidents.

01:30:25.333 --> 01:30:27.541
This deal will go down on my terms.

01:30:38.583 --> 01:30:39.708
All right, I'll come in.

01:30:42.083 --> 01:30:43.125
All right.

01:30:44.083 --> 01:30:45.708
I can't lose Marie as well.

01:30:47.791 --> 01:30:49.458
One more question, Mr. Toma.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.625
You wanted to speak
to Sophie Theissen directly.

01:30:52.708 --> 01:30:55.041
How could you be so sure
she'd be here in person?

01:30:58.583 --> 01:30:59.500
Say something.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
You idiot, say anything at all.

01:31:04.958 --> 01:31:06.083
Sophie, it's a trap!

01:31:32.083 --> 01:31:33.041
Sophie!

01:32:04.625 --> 01:32:05.625
Elena!

01:33:44.208 --> 01:33:45.208
Max!

01:33:48.250 --> 01:33:49.083
Watch out!

01:34:40.583 --> 01:34:42.875
-You okay?
-Are you all right?

01:34:43.375 --> 01:34:44.875
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

01:34:46.083 --> 01:34:47.541
Wait.

01:34:52.458 --> 01:34:54.333
Careful. Okay.

01:34:54.416 --> 01:34:56.000
We have to get out of here.

01:34:56.083 --> 01:34:57.416
-Marie!
-Come on!

01:34:57.500 --> 01:34:58.416
You go ahead.

01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:01.041
Marie! Come on, let's go.

01:35:01.125 --> 01:35:02.500
Hey, come on!

01:35:02.583 --> 01:35:04.750
Or do you want to die here? Come on.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.583
Let's go! Hurry.

01:35:12.250 --> 01:35:13.083
That way.

01:35:13.916 --> 01:35:14.916
Come on.

01:35:33.416 --> 01:35:34.333
I'm leaving now.

01:35:51.625 --> 01:35:52.625
Shit.

01:36:07.375 --> 01:36:08.208
Elena.

01:37:46.541 --> 01:37:47.916
It's not far from here.

01:37:59.833 --> 01:38:01.208
We almost killed her.

01:38:04.166 --> 01:38:05.583
She would have shot me.

01:38:07.916 --> 01:38:10.416
We know now
that she's not Sophie Theissen.

01:38:12.750 --> 01:38:14.541
You said she's compatible too.

01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:17.500
She can get it back from her mother.

01:38:17.583 --> 01:38:19.166
Her mother is dead.

01:38:20.250 --> 01:38:24.083
Marie has nothing to do with any of this.
If we do this, we're no better than them.

01:38:25.083 --> 01:38:26.875
Do you want to be better than them?

01:38:28.083 --> 01:38:29.791
Or do you want our life back?

01:38:31.291 --> 01:38:33.041
We wanted to have children.

01:38:34.666 --> 01:38:36.541
Not at the expense of innocent people.

01:38:37.208 --> 01:38:38.916
Our child was innocent too.

01:38:39.958 --> 01:38:41.458
Theissen took it from us.

01:38:42.291 --> 01:38:44.583
Theissen burned down our home,

01:38:45.416 --> 01:38:47.041
had your recipient killed.

01:38:47.666 --> 01:38:48.958
We have to go public.

01:38:49.041 --> 01:38:50.750
Does that get me back my years?

01:38:52.083 --> 01:38:53.333
From whom?

01:38:55.208 --> 01:38:58.708
There has to be another way
than this free-for-all.

01:39:01.541 --> 01:39:02.666
I can't see one.

01:39:14.375 --> 01:39:15.791
I can't do this anymore.

01:39:19.958 --> 01:39:21.750
We're taking her to the hospital now.

01:39:37.958 --> 01:39:38.833
Get out, please.

01:39:43.541 --> 01:39:44.625
You're not serious.

01:39:45.208 --> 01:39:46.208
Get out.

01:39:49.416 --> 01:39:50.666
Elena, this isn't you.

01:39:56.541 --> 01:39:57.500
Get out!

01:40:03.250 --> 01:40:04.250
Get out.

01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:10.916
No!

01:42:13.666 --> 01:42:14.666
No!

01:42:16.166 --> 01:42:17.000
No!

01:42:21.541 --> 01:42:22.791
No!

01:42:24.875 --> 01:42:25.833
No!

01:43:10.750 --> 01:43:12.666
-Come on, move it.
-Hurry up!

01:43:18.583 --> 01:43:20.041
Come on.

01:43:24.041 --> 01:43:25.916
-Should we bring the dead ones too?
-Yeah.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.583
These ones are going to the doctor
afterwards. These will wait for now.

01:43:29.666 --> 01:43:32.291
-Let's wait for what the boss says.
-What about the girl?

01:44:11.916 --> 01:44:14.416
Hello. Are you okay?

01:44:47.958 --> 01:44:53.000
REFUGEE CAMP Å KLÃˆRIAI
LITHUANIA

01:45:11.958 --> 01:45:12.958
It's okay.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.541
Luckily, you were faster
than your colleague.

01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:40.041
He was never my colleague.

01:45:40.875 --> 01:45:44.708
Are there any leads? We need to find
these people as soon as possible.

01:45:48.083 --> 01:45:49.166
Not my problem anymore.

01:45:50.791 --> 01:45:54.125
-What do you mean?
-I'm done hunting down people for you.

01:45:54.958 --> 01:45:56.625
I'm done burning down homes for you.

01:45:57.208 --> 01:45:59.666
And I won't arrange
any motorcycle accidents.

01:46:00.333 --> 01:46:01.375
I'm out.

01:46:05.625 --> 01:46:07.666
We've known each other
for half a lifetime.

01:46:08.625 --> 01:46:10.416
A life has to end one day.

01:46:34.291 --> 01:46:35.583
Hello, my darling.

01:46:47.916 --> 01:46:48.916
Mom?

01:46:51.875 --> 01:46:54.083
They said that you'd be compatible.

01:46:56.125 --> 01:46:58.875
We're so close to reaching our goals.

01:47:00.291 --> 01:47:02.458
I need all my strength for that now.

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:05.833
I'll do everything toâ€¦

01:47:07.208 --> 01:47:08.958
to find a donor for you.

01:47:11.250 --> 01:47:13.250
It's only a matter of time.

01:49:01.333 --> 01:49:03.333
To buy someone's life

01:49:03.416 --> 01:49:05.208
is just another way
of taking someone's life.

01:49:05.708 --> 01:49:06.750
I know this now.

01:49:06.833 --> 01:49:08.875
I have been part of it.

01:49:09.375 --> 01:49:11.250
As long as Aeon exists,

01:49:11.333 --> 01:49:13.416
as long as illegal transfers exist,

01:49:14.166 --> 01:49:16.250
this injustice will remain.

01:49:17.041 --> 01:49:18.750
The time to fight is now.

01:49:19.625 --> 01:49:20.666
If not for us,

01:49:21.541 --> 01:49:22.875
then for our children.
