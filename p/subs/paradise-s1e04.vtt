WEBVTT

00:02.377 --> 00:04.044
Why don't we just
tell everybody the truth?

00:04.045 --> 00:05.421
<i>What, that POTUS was murdered?</i>

00:05.422 --> 00:07.006
<i>And that his tablet
with government secrets</i>

00:07.007 --> 00:08.590
<i>and God knows what else is missing,</i>

00:08.591 --> 00:12.554
<i>and that we think the people
that built this place are covering it up?</i>

00:13.555 --> 00:14.596
I mean, I'd tune in.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.685
Cal is dead and we're just moving on.

00:19.686 --> 00:22.646
Going about our lives
as if nothing happened.

00:22.647 --> 00:24.606
They're still doing
the goddamn carnival tomorrow!

00:24.607 --> 00:27.067
<i>I thought you had surveillance
cameras all over the place.</i>

00:27.068 --> 00:28.652
Don't worry so much.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.863
If it comes down to it,
I'll deal with Robinson.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.490
<i>Why did you two shut down
the cameras the night of the murder?</i>

00:33.491 --> 00:34.701
We were playing Wii.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.537
We realized if we shut down
the security system,

00:38.538 --> 00:40.664
we could play his video games
and use his cool shit

00:40.665 --> 00:42.249
and no one would really be
the worse off for it.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.836
My God, you absolute idiots.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.757
I have a message from the president.

00:49.758 --> 00:52.969
He said if something should happen to him,
I should find you.

00:54.637 --> 00:56.847
<i>He said Billy Pace is dangerous.</i>

01:25.960 --> 01:27.504
Keep it movin', Billy.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.894
Take the shot.

01:46.314 --> 01:47.732
Goddammit.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.326
Fuckin' worthless idiot of a nephew.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.453
Never hesitate.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.581
That's how they hear you comin'.

02:04.707 --> 02:06.918
Never hesitate.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.432
Good boy.

02:22.433 --> 02:23.600
Hey.

02:23.601 --> 02:26.312
No, you don't.

02:27.772 --> 02:29.274
When somethin's no good...

02:32.068 --> 02:33.153
...it has to go.

03:07.395 --> 03:09.606
What the hell is the matter with you, boy?

03:11.524 --> 03:14.193
I told you, never hesi--

03:27.415 --> 03:28.499
Pace!

03:31.794 --> 03:33.046
You're Pace, right?

03:34.881 --> 03:36.382
Dude who killed his uncle?

03:37.842 --> 03:39.552
Killed his uncle over a dog.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.018
Stop!

04:19.133 --> 04:22.303
-  You Billy Pace?
- Who's asking?

04:24.347 --> 04:25.598
Your second chance.

04:27.433 --> 04:28.518
Let's go.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.396
I said let's go.

04:37.068 --> 04:39.487
Gentlemen, you are here
because you are violent men.

04:40.071 --> 04:42.030
Some of you plucked
from halfway houses and prisons.

04:42.031 --> 04:44.200
Some of you are flameouts from the SEALs.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.204
But where some might see
a pile of unredeemable fuck-ups,

04:49.289 --> 04:50.914
I see opportunity.

04:50.915 --> 04:53.250
I see mercenaries, people who fight wars
in parts of the world

04:53.251 --> 04:56.003
where governments are too chickenshit
to send in their own militaries

04:56.004 --> 04:58.797
for all kinds of shameful reasons
related to the pussification

04:58.798 --> 05:00.341
of this entire fuckin' planet.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.092
So, how does that sound?

05:02.093 --> 05:05.638
Get paid handsomely to travel the world,
meet interesting people,

05:06.347 --> 05:07.515
and fuckin' kill 'em.

05:08.349 --> 05:10.643
Now, the man next to me
will be known to you as Bull.

05:11.728 --> 05:14.271
He was about as unredeemable
a fuck-up as they come.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.982
But now, he's a highly disciplined
killing machine,

05:16.983 --> 05:19.901
and his mommy is so very, very proud.

05:19.902 --> 05:21.612
So, who thinks they can take him?

05:23.197 --> 05:25.199
I told you.
Bunch of fuckin' pussies.

05:25.825 --> 05:28.244
Oh. Here we go, we got a buyer.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.496
Billy the kid.
Alright, you'll go when I say--

06:18.669 --> 06:21.755
Okay, so I know we're in a literal
world of shit with Robinson,

06:21.756 --> 06:24.257
and I'm by no means unaware
of how deep that literal shit is.

06:24.258 --> 06:27.219
- But Billy?
- Yeah?

06:27.220 --> 06:28.971
I'm too excited to sleep.

06:31.307 --> 06:32.432
'Cause of the carnival.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.811
- The carnival, baby!
- Right.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.563
Um, I didn't know what to wear,

06:38.564 --> 06:39.898
but I brought options.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.359
And you are picking.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.486
Okay.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.656
I have this one, or...

06:47.657 --> 06:49.242
uh, this one.

06:50.159 --> 06:52.119
Well, Jane, our little secret romance

06:52.120 --> 06:55.205
goes right out the window
if you put any of those on,

06:55.206 --> 06:57.834
'cause I'm not gonna be able
to keep my hands off you.

06:58.876 --> 07:01.128
These outfits might be
slightly inappropriate,

07:01.129 --> 07:04.548
but I can't control the thoughts
of a bunch of cave-dwelling pervs.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.550
And besides...

07:18.980 --> 07:21.482
Oh, shit.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.735
Good morning to you as well.

07:25.736 --> 07:28.155
My kids have no idea where I am.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.116
Have they never stayed home alone?

07:30.700 --> 07:35.996
When I work late.
But, uh, we have a system.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.373
I always let Presley know beforehand.

07:38.374 --> 07:39.958
Probably gonna wanna catch them

07:39.959 --> 07:41.377
before they head to the carnival.

07:42.086 --> 07:43.713
- Is that today?
- Mm-hmm.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.174
That's insane.

07:47.175 --> 07:50.635
The man isn't even in the ground yet,
and they're gonna throw a carnival

07:50.636 --> 07:52.180
the day before his funeral.

07:59.395 --> 08:02.105
- So...
- So...

08:02.106 --> 08:06.943
Um... last night was-- it was really nice.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.404
Stop it, I'll faint.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.075
So, about what I, uh, said...

08:14.285 --> 08:18.414
Yeah, um, that didn't track for me.
But, uh, I'll talk to him.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.250
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.927
- Maybe I'll see you at the carnival.
- Oh, yeah.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.555
- Yeah.
- Carnival, yeah.

08:53.574 --> 08:56.159
-  I want Mom! Where is she?
-  She's coming, right?

08:56.160 --> 08:57.536
-  All weapons...
- Motherfucker!

08:57.537 --> 08:59.746
...and prohibited items
must be surrendered.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.456
Have you talked to Mom?
Is she coming?

09:01.457 --> 09:04.293
All weapons and prohibited items...

09:04.544 --> 09:05.795
I want Mom!

09:06.254 --> 09:10.215
That includes any outside electronics.

09:10.216 --> 09:13.301
Stay calm and keep moving.

09:13.302 --> 09:14.928
Make sure your wristband...

09:14.929 --> 09:17.514
You will be scanned.
Step forward, please.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.432
Wristbands.

09:19.433 --> 09:20.518
Come on.

09:22.603 --> 09:26.064
Collins, Xavier.
Two minors. Spouse, Teri Collins.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.984
My wife... my wife didn't make the plane.

09:32.613 --> 09:33.781
I'm sorry.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.870
Do not lose your wristbands.

09:49.797 --> 09:52.173
-  What are they doing?
-  Keep going, keep going.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.551
-  We almost didn't make it.
- I need you to calm down.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.845
Everybody is gone. Oh God!

10:04.520 --> 10:09.065
[muffled] Whether you're cops,
soldiers, Secret Service,

10:09.066 --> 10:13.945
or private security,
we are all here to do the same job:

10:13.946 --> 10:15.614
provide stability.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.907
Excuse me. Collins, right?

10:17.908 --> 10:19.909
Billy Pace. They told me to come find you.

10:19.910 --> 10:23.705
They want us to start securing the area,
get people inside of the residences.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.206
What-- what residences?

10:25.207 --> 10:26.792
I got no fuckin' clue, bro.

10:27.752 --> 10:28.919
This way.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.855
You can't just have
sugar cereal every day.

10:48.856 --> 10:52.817
Yeah, I know the fake bacon is gross,
but you just gotta close your eyes,

10:52.818 --> 10:53.943
and pretend it's the real thing.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.362
Alright.

10:55.363 --> 10:58.031
But, you can have cereal too,
if you promise to drink the milk.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.574
Okay, I will.

10:59.575 --> 11:00.743
Morning.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.372
Morning.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.707
Did I misunderstand our system?

11:07.708 --> 11:09.627
- I... um--
- 'Cause last I checked, we had a system.

11:10.252 --> 11:11.961
I am...

11:11.962 --> 11:14.172
Dad, if you're working the night shift,
you have to let me know.

11:14.173 --> 11:17.593
Hey, I know. And, um, I am so sorry.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.345
I just...

11:21.013 --> 11:22.305
I screwed up.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.558
Uh-huh. It's okay.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.269
I know it's been a weird few days.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.690
Here, gag on some fake bacon.
You'll feel better.

11:34.443 --> 11:36.778
- We're going today, right?
- To the carnival?

11:36.779 --> 11:39.572
- You know it, bud.
- I will meet you guys there later.

11:39.573 --> 11:41.700
I am heading to the carnival
to help the band set up.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.076
What band?

11:43.077 --> 11:45.036
Just the one that's playing
at the carnival.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.997
Okay.
Sorry, I'm just playing catch-up here.

11:47.998 --> 11:50.000
Are you in a band?

11:50.668 --> 11:51.710
No, it's Jeremy's band.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.753
- Jeremy...?
- Bradford.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.004
Wait, Cal's son?

11:55.005 --> 11:57.757
I thought-- I thought
we didn't like this kid.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.885
Jeez, Dad. He just lost his father.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.221
We're just hanging out.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.725
Alright, I'm out, boys. Love you both.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.684
Love you more.

12:07.685 --> 12:10.396
Enjoy...

12:13.315 --> 12:16.110
-  I think it's hormones.
- Where'd you learn about that?

12:18.195 --> 12:19.238
Oh.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.448
- Dad, guess what?
- Hm?

12:21.449 --> 12:23.908
I've made a huge decision,
and I think you're gonna like it.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.787
I've decided I'm ready for that
Ferris wheel this year, the big one.

12:28.038 --> 12:30.373
- Dad.
- Yeah, man, absolutely.

12:30.374 --> 12:32.000
This is your year.

12:32.001 --> 12:35.378
Hey, J, I gotta run and talk
to Uncle Billy real quick.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.714
I'm gonna drop you off with
Carl and Lucy across the street.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.592
Come back later, okay? Let's go.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.904
One week down here,
and of all the weird shit I've seen,

13:00.905 --> 13:05.575
the fact that they thought to make bars
is by far the fucking weirdest.

13:05.576 --> 13:06.952
- Yeah.
- Fully stocked.

13:08.078 --> 13:09.996
More booze down here
than Sandal's Jamaica.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.081
Huh.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.374
How can I help you guys?

13:13.375 --> 13:16.127
Secret Service.
We're securing the area for the president

13:16.128 --> 13:18.422
in case he wants to come by
after his speech.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.757
"Securing the area."

13:20.758 --> 13:22.675
Okay. Okay, yeah. Uh, sure.

13:22.676 --> 13:23.844
Do what you gotta do.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.597
Word is, Prezzo drinks
like a fuckin' fish.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.974
- Agent Pace.
- He should see the cellar.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.143
Must be two football fields'
worth of sauce down there.

13:32.144 --> 13:33.937
Top-shelf stuff, too. You wanna see?

13:33.938 --> 13:36.482
We're just acquainting ourselves
with entrances and exits.

13:37.566 --> 13:39.485
Uh, then can I acquaint you

13:40.194 --> 13:43.405
with three fingers of the finest bourbon
known to man?

13:44.532 --> 13:46.367
- I'm your huckleberry.
- We're on duty.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.744
Well, your loss.

13:49.411 --> 13:52.289
Stuff went for thousands of dollars a pop
up above.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.750
Hey, they give you a house?
They gave me a house.

13:55.751 --> 13:57.877
It-- it's nice.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.171
Mm, my wife went nuts.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.048
Yeah, I got a house.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.341
- Yeah?
-  Same.

14:03.342 --> 14:06.720
Never had a house before.
I rarely slept indoors.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.348
Come on, don't let me
drink the good shit alone, here.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.641
I don't wanna be rude to this man.

14:11.642 --> 14:12.768
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

14:13.435 --> 14:14.936
To the end of the world.

14:19.441 --> 14:20.526
Wow.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.612
So what, are you like the world's
greatest bartender or something?

14:24.613 --> 14:25.780
How'd you get this gig?

14:25.781 --> 14:29.826
Well, my wife is one of the preeminent
atmospheric scientists in the world.

14:29.827 --> 14:32.954
I guess they realized they were getting
two for the price of one,

14:32.955 --> 14:36.165
me being a preeminent mixologist and all.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.878
Just how drunk do you think
we'd have to get

14:39.879 --> 14:42.672
to forget that we're inside a mountain?

14:42.673 --> 14:44.550
- I'd sure as fuck like to find out.
- Yeah.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.600
Come on. We gotta get him to the arena.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.353
- They got a fuckin' arena.
- Yeah.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.616
"Moving forward takes
incredible commitment and hard work.

15:09.617 --> 15:12.243
We will act to lay a new--"
I'm good actually, thank you.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.245
"Now begins the hard but necessary work

15:14.246 --> 15:16.623
of moving into the future,
forging a new path."

15:16.624 --> 15:18.291
"Forging a new path."
Does that sound like me?

15:18.292 --> 15:20.501
Is that even remotely what people
wanna hear right now?

15:20.502 --> 15:22.296
Sounds fine, sir.

15:25.299 --> 15:29.053
Scary new guy, what do you think?
Is this the right vibe for this situation?

15:30.095 --> 15:31.387
It's okay, you can speak freely.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.182
What do you think people
need to hear right now?

15:36.268 --> 15:39.270
Honestly, sir, this whole situation's
majorly fucked up.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.105
- Pace.
- Not a virgin, Xavier.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.191
It's okay. Continue.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.611
It's just, everything up there's gone.

15:46.320 --> 15:47.696
This shit's not normal.

15:48.489 --> 15:51.450
I think it might mean a lot to people
to hear their president say so.

15:53.494 --> 15:54.495
Sir.

15:57.873 --> 16:00.750
I like that. I like him.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.836
Yep, okay.

16:03.837 --> 16:05.923
Thanks for the advice, sir.

16:12.262 --> 16:14.181
I don't know about you, but I'd fuck him.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.427
You sure you're up for this?

16:52.594 --> 16:54.471
Yeah, yeah. No, I'm-- I'm, uh...

16:56.181 --> 16:58.559
I'm fine. I just, uh...

17:00.769 --> 17:03.939
I remember how much my dad
loved this carnival, you know.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.817
Reminding everyone
that there can be joy down here

17:07.818 --> 17:09.445
like there was up there.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.823
Whatever he used to say. But, um...

17:14.533 --> 17:17.076
it just feels wrong, you know?

17:17.077 --> 17:19.203
Playing crappy '80s songs

17:19.204 --> 17:23.125
and going on cheesy rides
and fucking around.

17:24.418 --> 17:26.753
- Especially after--
- You're not fucking around.

17:26.754 --> 17:30.299
You're making music for people.
People who live in a cave.

17:31.675 --> 17:34.219
And you're giving them joy and shit.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.890
- Joy and shit?
- Hey, joy and shit's not nothing.

17:38.974 --> 17:40.768
Don't underestimate joy and shit.

17:45.981 --> 17:47.649
It is pretty fucking weird though.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.505
Boss. What are you doing here?

18:52.506 --> 18:53.840
Jane, hey.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.883
I was, uh, just dealing
with some paperwork

18:55.884 --> 18:57.093
before the carnival.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.929
Oh yeah, you and me both.

19:00.472 --> 19:04.183
Jane, I know you're close with Billy.

19:04.184 --> 19:07.187
I know you're... really close.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.564
What? No, I mean, we're friends but--

19:09.565 --> 19:10.899
Jane.

19:11.483 --> 19:15.195
Have you noticed him seeming a little off?

19:17.030 --> 19:18.073
Not really.

19:19.199 --> 19:21.368
I mean, maybe he's been
a little distracted,

19:21.994 --> 19:23.995
and he's usually way more
excited about the carnival.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.789
Right?
You wouldn't suspect that about him,

19:26.790 --> 19:30.418
being that into kiddie rides,
and cotton candy, and stuff.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.504
He's a complicated man.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.465
I mean, if you're into that kind of thing.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.927
Anyway, it's a holiday.

19:40.095 --> 19:42.138
- Go celebrate.
- Yes.

19:42.139 --> 19:43.724
- I'll see you there.
- Alright.

19:59.740 --> 20:03.159
The Hemingway daiquiri,
my two-month specialty cocktail.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.285
The real deal.

20:04.286 --> 20:07.496
Be careful, gentlemen.
Those things will put you under the table.

20:07.497 --> 20:09.290
They can put 'em back, babe.
You'd be impressed.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.542
I'm a hard girl to impress.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.002
Don't I know it.

20:22.554 --> 20:23.722
You good, boss?

20:24.848 --> 20:25.933
Yeah.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.185
Two months.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.063
We've been down here
for two months, Billy.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.732
It's, uh, normalizing.

20:34.733 --> 20:35.984
Mm.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.948
I think it's the normal stuff
that makes me the most sad.

20:43.325 --> 20:48.037
A bartender kissing his wife,
drink at a bar with a friend.

20:48.038 --> 20:50.249
And for a second, I forget.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.544
I forget what I've lost.

21:00.175 --> 21:02.677
- You called me friend.
- Oh, fuck you.

21:05.514 --> 21:06.807
I don't know, man.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.479
That world, the old one...

21:14.314 --> 21:17.942
it just started kicking the shit out of me

21:17.943 --> 21:19.236
at a pretty young age.

21:19.778 --> 21:24.740
And so, I guess I just started
kicking the shit out of it right back.

21:24.741 --> 21:29.328
And there's some things that I've seen, X,

21:29.329 --> 21:31.872
some things that I've done that...

21:34.543 --> 21:37.087
I don't know if you'd be sitting
here with me if you knew.

21:39.464 --> 21:42.592
And so, I don't wanna sound
like an asshole, but...

21:44.928 --> 21:50.267
everything down here that's good
and everything down here that's normal...

21:52.019 --> 21:54.438
just kinda makes me feel normal.

21:55.605 --> 21:57.065
Just makes me feel good.

22:00.736 --> 22:04.238
Just never had any of that
in the old world

22:04.239 --> 22:07.701
that kicked my ass
before it taught me the alphabet.

22:08.827 --> 22:12.080
Never had a drink with a friend at a bar.

22:13.248 --> 22:16.335
Just couldn't find one.

22:17.961 --> 22:21.672
- No bars in your town?
-  Yes, exactly.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.560
You should come over sometime.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.896
Meet the kids,
have dinner with the family.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.481
You know, since we're officially--

22:38.482 --> 22:40.275
- Best friends?
- I didn't say "best."

22:40.859 --> 22:42.861
- You kind of did with your face though.
- Oh.

22:46.698 --> 22:47.824
What do I wear?

22:51.244 --> 22:53.497
I brought Pinot
'cause it sounded the funniest.

22:53.955 --> 22:55.248
You look insane.

22:56.833 --> 22:57.917
Hey, kids.

22:57.918 --> 23:00.878
Got someone for you to meet.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.298
Oh, fuck.
They're smaller than I thought they'd be.

23:05.008 --> 23:07.677
- Sorry.
- Uh-huh. This is Billy.

23:08.970 --> 23:10.721
He's never seen children before.

23:10.722 --> 23:13.642
That's-- that's not true.

23:14.643 --> 23:17.770
Hey, nice to meet you guys.
I'm-- I'm Billy.

23:17.771 --> 23:20.023
I'm your dad's new best friend.

23:20.649 --> 23:25.987
So, you can call me Uncle Billy
if you want, or-- or not.

23:27.697 --> 23:29.616
This is going well, I think.

23:30.242 --> 23:34.161
I kinda regret dropping down
to one knee, but here we are.

24:04.943 --> 24:09.697
This is a song by a band
that my dad loved called Poison.

24:09.698 --> 24:13.826
Um... "Greatest ballad of all time."

24:13.827 --> 24:15.411
His words, not mine.

24:15.412 --> 24:16.787
So, uh...

24:16.788 --> 24:19.457
...thanks to a
good friend for pushing me to do this.

25:02.042 --> 25:04.960
Okay, help me put this list
in order of importance.

25:04.961 --> 25:06.587
- Okay.
- Eat funnel cake...

25:06.588 --> 25:07.796
- Yeah.
- ...ride the rides,

25:07.797 --> 25:09.423
and get matching fake tattoos.

25:09.424 --> 25:11.550
Oh, and sparklers.

25:11.551 --> 25:13.719
You know what?
Sparklers come at the end of the day.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.930
We can save that for later
once it gets dark.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.139
You love this shit, huh?

25:17.140 --> 25:18.766
So do you, don't play.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.852
- Mm-hmm.
-  We need to talk.

25:21.895 --> 25:24.523
Just you, Pace,
not your video game partner.

25:26.399 --> 25:28.818
- What, here?
- No, on the moon.

25:30.654 --> 25:32.030
The fuck are you wearing?

25:32.864 --> 25:33.865
My carnival outfit?

25:34.908 --> 25:36.117
I'm off duty.

25:37.494 --> 25:39.371
Your pal Xavier's on Sinatra's radar now.

25:39.955 --> 25:42.749
It's not a radar you wanna be on.
Let's go.

25:58.306 --> 26:00.225
I mean, it's just a Ferris wheel.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.768
It's gotta be one
of the safest rides there is.

26:02.769 --> 26:04.062
Definitely.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.522
Just statistically speaking,

26:06.523 --> 26:09.191
those idiots twirling all around
in that spinning thing

26:09.192 --> 26:10.818
are in a much more
dangerous situation, right?

26:10.819 --> 26:13.612
Hey, man, let me know if you
see your Uncle Billy, okay?

26:16.783 --> 26:19.326
You know what, actually, bud?
Let's-- let's go this way.

26:19.327 --> 26:20.495
Wait, right to it?

26:21.496 --> 26:22.706
No warm-up ride?

26:23.290 --> 26:24.499
No candy apple?

26:25.625 --> 26:27.544
I-- I really think I should go pee first.

26:28.753 --> 26:31.298
I-- I definitely should go number one
before we hit the ride, Dad.

26:32.007 --> 26:33.007
Mm-hmm.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.800
Dad, I seriously have to go the bath...

26:41.641 --> 26:43.017
-  Dad!
- Yeah?

26:43.018 --> 26:46.313
- Come on, let's go to the bathroom.
- Let's go, let's go. Come on, come on.

26:58.033 --> 27:00.535
Hey, what's up?
I was looking for your dad.

27:03.663 --> 27:06.916
Who's the asshole?
You want me to break his arm?

27:08.418 --> 27:11.462
It's the president's kid, isn't it?
With the annoying hair?

27:11.463 --> 27:14.840
- His hair isn't annoying.
- Oh, it so is.

27:14.841 --> 27:16.426
How'd you notice?

27:16.801 --> 27:19.012
Mm, because noticing things
is what I do for a living.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.930
And besides, you two couldn't
be more obvious if you tried.

27:21.931 --> 27:24.517
Oh yeah, like you and Jane
aren't so obvious.

27:25.518 --> 27:26.769
You noticed?

27:26.770 --> 27:28.562
Noticing things is what I do for a living.

27:28.563 --> 27:30.148
Okay, don't be an asshole.

27:31.816 --> 27:34.235
Alright, you like this kid?

27:35.695 --> 27:37.864
- Yeah.
- And he likes you?

27:39.658 --> 27:42.117
I don't know, I feel like
I'm just stuck in the friend zone.

27:42.118 --> 27:44.537
Of course, he does. Presley, look at me.

27:46.414 --> 27:48.999
So, one night,
Jane and I were on duty together,

27:49.000 --> 27:50.584
and it's like 3:30 in the morning.

27:50.585 --> 27:52.419
<i>- Mario Kart?
- Wii Punch-Out.</i>

27:52.420 --> 27:54.505
This was before you started
coming over for game night,

27:54.506 --> 27:56.507
which, by the way,
is not a secret anymore,

27:56.508 --> 27:59.135
and I'm kind of in deep shit,
so don't say anything to your dad.

27:59.803 --> 28:04.264
Anyway, a ways back, me and Jane,
playing Wii <i>Punch-Out,</i>

28:04.265 --> 28:08.477
and things started to get
kind of intense, you know?

28:08.478 --> 28:10.312
Like physical.

28:10.313 --> 28:12.856
And I've been
with women before, obviously,

28:12.857 --> 28:15.776
in the way that men can get
with women, if you--

28:15.777 --> 28:17.778
- Dude.
- Okay, sorry.

28:17.779 --> 28:22.659
But I never once in my entire life
told a woman that I like her.

28:23.993 --> 28:27.496
So, there we are,
and we're playing <i>Punch-Out.</i>

28:27.497 --> 28:29.124
And I just said, fuck it.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.961
The world blew up.
What am I scared of, right?

28:33.545 --> 28:36.505
So, I said, "Look, babe,
I think you like me,

28:36.506 --> 28:39.217
"and I think I like you.

28:40.385 --> 28:41.970
In fact, you knock me out."

28:43.430 --> 28:44.472
And that was that.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.683
"You knock me out"?

28:47.684 --> 28:50.102
Yeah, 'cause we were playing <i>Punch-Out,
so that's just what came out.</i>

28:50.103 --> 28:52.188
You know what? Shut up, it worked.

28:52.689 --> 28:56.067
The point is,
go tell the douchebag you like him.

28:57.527 --> 29:00.447
Never hesitate. Shoot your shot.

29:01.322 --> 29:03.407
Oh, shit!

29:03.408 --> 29:04.783
You see that?

29:04.784 --> 29:07.328
I was just doing that to be cool,
but I fuckin' nailed it.

29:08.079 --> 29:09.663
Thanks, man.

29:09.664 --> 29:13.084
Hey, the offer to break his arm
is still on the table.

29:13.668 --> 29:14.836
Appreciate it.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.130
Hey, you seen your dad?

29:17.839 --> 29:19.883
- No.
- Alright.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.653
Uh, maybe we should
hit the dump tank first.

29:41.654 --> 29:43.489
My math teacher's in there,
so I'm motivated.

29:43.490 --> 29:46.450
James, the time has come
to face your fears.

29:46.451 --> 29:49.244
I promise I'll be with you
every step of the way, okay?

29:52.290 --> 29:53.540
Oh, she's headed right over.

29:55.251 --> 29:57.252
- Doct-- Gabriela, hey.
- Hi.

29:57.253 --> 29:59.254
How are you? It's nice to see you.

29:59.255 --> 30:00.380
Mm-hmm.

30:00.381 --> 30:02.633
I was looking for you. Um...

30:02.634 --> 30:05.093
Alright, just breathe, buddy,
you got this.

30:05.094 --> 30:07.262
-  Hi.
- Hi.

30:07.263 --> 30:11.350
James, this is my friend, Gabriela.

30:11.351 --> 30:14.603
- Gabriela, this is James.
- It's a pleasure, James.

30:14.604 --> 30:17.064
It's a pleasure, Gabriela.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.483
Give us a sec, bud.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.529
Uh, listen,

30:24.364 --> 30:25.864
last night was great.

30:25.865 --> 30:27.742
Better than great, actually.

30:28.701 --> 30:31.119
- But I'm not in a place where--
- Okay, let me just stop you right there,

30:31.120 --> 30:33.664
because if this gets any more romantic,
my heart won't go on.

30:33.665 --> 30:36.291
Last night was great,

30:36.292 --> 30:38.878
and maybe we'll do it again sometime,
or maybe not.

30:39.379 --> 30:42.465
But I was gonna ask
if you've had a chance to talk to him.

30:43.091 --> 30:45.551
Um, not yet.

30:45.552 --> 30:48.346
- I'm trying.
- You could try harder.

30:49.389 --> 30:51.057
I just saw him in the funnel cake line.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.436
Hey, Gabriela's gonna stay with you
for a minute, okay, J?

30:56.437 --> 30:58.981
- I promise, I'll be quick.
- I'm in zero rush.

31:27.468 --> 31:29.803
Mr. President,
you're becoming a regular here.

31:29.804 --> 31:32.098
You should at least allow us
to secure the area.

31:33.266 --> 31:36.352
It's month three in an underground city
with no weapons.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.771
Someone gonna flick me to death
with a cocktail straw?

31:39.772 --> 31:43.067
Oh, Jesus Christ,
it's so depressing.

31:44.110 --> 31:46.195
I mean, you think some people
would be happy we made it.

31:46.821 --> 31:49.281
Hey, scary Billy Pace,
what's up everyone's ass?

31:49.282 --> 31:52.076
No idea, sir.
Personally, I'm happy as a pig in shit.

31:52.619 --> 31:53.828
He's not, though.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.039
He lost someone.

31:57.624 --> 32:00.042
Ready for another drink, Mr. President?

32:00.043 --> 32:01.877
Yeah, you know what?
Why don't you just keep 'em coming

32:01.878 --> 32:03.379
till I say stop?

32:04.547 --> 32:07.341
Wait, you work for me, don't you?
You're one of the scientists.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.761
It's my husband's bar.
Help out when it gets busy.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.679
Well, that is really goddamn sweet.

32:12.680 --> 32:14.765
That's exactly what
I'm talking about right there.

32:18.645 --> 32:20.730
So, that's it then?

32:22.065 --> 32:24.067
Everyone lost someone, no way to fix it?

32:25.234 --> 32:26.652
Hmm?

32:26.653 --> 32:28.196
It's the not knowing, sir.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.866
The not knowing?
You talking about up there?

32:32.867 --> 32:35.745
'Cause we know. Trust me, we know.

32:37.789 --> 32:40.290
I mean, you say it's all gone, but we--

32:40.291 --> 32:42.584
Billy, it is gone.

32:42.585 --> 32:44.920
We have no communication, it's all fried.

32:44.921 --> 32:48.758
Any gauge readings show
limited signs of viable life, at best.

32:50.218 --> 32:53.637
Anything that's left out there is fighting
to survive, desperate and starving.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.848
Yeah, but could people have survived?

32:57.600 --> 33:00.228
Could somebody's somebody
be okay up there?

33:09.112 --> 33:10.530
It's the not knowing.

33:12.156 --> 33:13.741
Which is what I fuckin' said.

33:17.537 --> 33:18.705
The not knowing.

33:19.706 --> 33:23.125
[on TV] <i>Six months ago,
our lives changed forever.</i>

33:23.126 --> 33:26.294
<i>All major communication
with the surface was lost,</i>

33:26.295 --> 33:28.839
<i>and any meager information
we've been able to obtain</i>

33:28.840 --> 33:33.344
<i>tells us the world outside
is simply no longer survivable.</i>

33:34.470 --> 33:36.222
<i>And yet, I know each and every one of us</i>

33:36.848 --> 33:40.643
<i>has this voice in our heads,
saying, "Maybe."</i>

33:41.394 --> 33:43.729
That's why we're sending
these four brave explorers

33:43.730 --> 33:46.815
into the unknown to assess it,

33:46.816 --> 33:49.443
<i>to get answers, and bring them
safely back to us.</i>

33:49.444 --> 33:52.071
<i>Now, they may not tell us
what we wanna hear,</i>

33:52.780 --> 33:55.949
<i>but you have my word as your president,
it will be the truth.</i>

33:55.950 --> 33:57.367
<i>I owe you nothing less.</i>

33:57.368 --> 34:01.205
You think they'll find anything?
I mean, like, people?

34:02.915 --> 34:04.375
I don't know, baby.

34:28.149 --> 34:30.318
- You have to stop.
- Not here.

34:34.781 --> 34:36.239
You gotta stop.

34:36.240 --> 34:38.742
- These people are not playing.
- What people?

34:38.743 --> 34:40.285
- Sinatra?
- Listen to me,

34:40.286 --> 34:41.870
I need you to trust me on this.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.538
You need to back the fuck off
like right now.

34:43.539 --> 34:45.248
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Come on.

34:45.249 --> 34:47.542
You're sitting in a dark room
and you're reading up on me.

34:47.543 --> 34:49.836
- Cut the shit, okay?
- Oh, you want me to cut the shit?

34:49.837 --> 34:52.547
Why'd you tell me you were at work
when you were still at home?

34:52.548 --> 34:53.841
- When?
- This morning.

34:54.842 --> 34:56.259
You know-- fuck it.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.637
Jane was over, and I didn't want you
to know we're together.

34:58.638 --> 35:01.890
You think I don't know?
Billy, it couldn't be more obvious.

35:01.891 --> 35:04.059
Wait, how the fuck do you know
what I was doing this morning?

35:04.060 --> 35:05.352
What are you, staking me out?

35:05.353 --> 35:07.604
Did you stop the security cameras
the night of the murder?

35:07.605 --> 35:10.357
I explained this to Robinson already, man.
Jane and I--

35:10.358 --> 35:14.737
What the fuck did you do, Billy?
Did you kill him?

35:15.321 --> 35:19.074
Did you fucking kill him?
Who put you up to it?

35:19.075 --> 35:20.826
Are you seriously
asking me that right now?

35:20.827 --> 35:22.452
- Fuck you.
- He told people

35:22.453 --> 35:25.664
to watch out for you, Billy,
right before he was killed.

35:25.665 --> 35:28.667
- So, just tell me the truth.
- How do you even think that about me?

35:28.668 --> 35:30.670
I took you in, man.

35:31.295 --> 35:35.924
I brought you into my home
and I know nothing about you.

35:35.925 --> 35:37.884
- I let you around my kids, man.
- Your kids--

35:37.885 --> 35:41.054
your kids are my fuckin' world, man!

35:41.055 --> 35:43.890
I'm following 'em around,
making sure nobody gets anywhere near 'em.

35:43.891 --> 35:45.934
Jesus Christ, X,
you guys are the only thing

35:45.935 --> 35:47.978
in this fuckin' place
that fuckin' matters to me.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.856
You know that! Fuck this!

36:05.288 --> 36:07.373
Going down, going down!

36:14.881 --> 36:15.965
How'd it go?

36:17.508 --> 36:19.719
It's not him.

36:20.928 --> 36:22.429
Xavier, I know it's hard to admit

36:22.430 --> 36:24.473
- that a friend--
- It's not him.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.442
So, why would Cal tell me that it was?

36:36.235 --> 36:37.320
I don't know.

36:43.451 --> 36:45.536
It's pretty empty tonight.

36:46.621 --> 36:48.206
One of the slowest nights
of the year.

36:51.709 --> 36:55.588
All those families out there
acting all... carnivally.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.758
It's gotta be a tough day for you.

36:59.967 --> 37:01.594
Well, every day's a tough day without her.

37:04.180 --> 37:05.223
I begged her not to go.

37:06.307 --> 37:07.516
Fuckin' suicide mission.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.436
But she had to see what was out there.

37:11.437 --> 37:13.773
She had to see for herself
and everybody else.

37:16.943 --> 37:18.485
"There's no stopping her."

37:18.486 --> 37:20.321
That's what I told everyone.

37:22.573 --> 37:24.408
Found some other fool
to take her damn spot.

37:25.576 --> 37:27.327
I should have stopped her.

37:30.748 --> 37:32.415
I gotta go.

37:32.416 --> 37:33.584
Close you out?

37:34.585 --> 37:36.544
Yeah, put it on the platinum card.

37:36.545 --> 37:38.255
Will do.

38:27.888 --> 38:29.389
They need to know.

38:29.390 --> 38:31.934
It's not what we thought. There's life.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.102
The air. You can breathe--

39:38.209 --> 39:40.086
I've done everything
you've ever asked of me.

39:42.088 --> 39:43.464
I know, you have.

39:44.924 --> 39:48.052
I was starting over, I had a new life,
and you sent me out there.

39:48.719 --> 39:51.846
Sent me out there to kill those people,
keep everybody scared,

39:51.847 --> 39:53.724
so they'd give up hope of ever leaving.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.643
You're spinning, Billy.
Come on now, sit down.

40:04.819 --> 40:07.238
This isn't the life I planned for myself.

40:08.906 --> 40:12.034
I ran an internet company, cloud storage.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.162
Took pottery classes on the weekends.

40:16.872 --> 40:19.834
I made an ashtray, used to put
my wedding ring in it at night.

40:26.882 --> 40:28.925
I don't know if you noticed,

40:28.926 --> 40:30.970
but it's not exactly
the Ritz up there, Billy.

40:31.554 --> 40:34.764
Conditions, even if
they're technically livable,

40:34.765 --> 40:36.142
they're not hospitable.

40:36.851 --> 40:41.187
And by not hospitable,
I mean a third world planet

40:41.188 --> 40:45.692
where anyone left is most definitely
tearing each other apart

40:45.693 --> 40:48.654
for the scarcest of resources right now.

40:49.238 --> 40:51.698
The best place to be, if you want anything

40:51.699 --> 40:54.701
remotely resembling
a decent life on Earth,

40:54.702 --> 40:57.580
is right here...

40:59.832 --> 41:01.167
where we are.

41:03.919 --> 41:05.254
And that's worth protecting.

41:05.671 --> 41:07.965
These people are worth protecting.

41:10.426 --> 41:13.928
And that's why folks like you and me
are forced to do the hard thing sometimes.

41:13.929 --> 41:17.266
You didn't do shit. You sent me.

41:19.602 --> 41:20.602
But you're the monster.

41:24.273 --> 41:25.733
I'm not a monster, Billy.

41:27.109 --> 41:28.235
I promise.

41:31.071 --> 41:32.281
I'm a wife.

41:33.908 --> 41:35.159
I'm a mom.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.499
Have I ever told you
what happened with my son?

41:42.500 --> 41:45.377
I don't give a fuck what happened
to your son.

41:46.420 --> 41:49.632
I didn't ask any questions.

41:51.008 --> 41:52.717
I didn't cause you any problems.

41:52.718 --> 41:55.554
But you're gonna leave
Xavier Collins be...

41:57.306 --> 41:58.766
or we're gonna have a problem.

41:59.683 --> 42:01.392
- Is that so?
- That's so.

42:01.393 --> 42:02.770
Okay, so...

42:04.897 --> 42:06.524
just making sure I'm getting this.

42:08.734 --> 42:11.027
You're giving me orders now?

42:11.028 --> 42:12.279
Yeah, that's right.

42:20.162 --> 42:22.872
That's odd though,
because last time I checked,

42:22.873 --> 42:26.585
giving orders was my job, not yours.

42:28.546 --> 42:31.215
Do you wanna know
what your job is, William Pace?

42:33.342 --> 42:36.720
Juvenile delinquent, convicted murderer.

42:37.930 --> 42:39.890
Highly paid mercenary.

42:40.933 --> 42:42.309
You're a killer.

42:43.644 --> 42:45.145
That's all you are.

42:47.022 --> 42:49.941
That's all you have to offer the world.
It's all you've ever had to offer.

42:49.942 --> 42:54.822
And it's all you offer
to me now down here.

42:56.615 --> 42:58.033
That's why you were spared.

42:59.076 --> 43:03.037
One of the 25,000 people
lucky enough to be spared,

43:03.038 --> 43:06.041
and then protected by me.

43:08.168 --> 43:11.713
So, you're gonna shut the fuck up,
and you're gonna apologize

43:11.714 --> 43:14.007
for marching in here
without an appointment.

43:14.008 --> 43:16.509
And then, you're gonna wait
for the next time

43:16.510 --> 43:19.430
I tell you I need someone dead.

43:28.439 --> 43:31.941
Or I'm gonna take away every good thing

43:31.942 --> 43:35.237
you mistakenly think
you've earned down here.

43:36.405 --> 43:37.781
I'll take it all away.

43:38.240 --> 43:39.241
Hm.

43:39.867 --> 43:41.493
I'll take her away, Billy.

43:43.245 --> 43:46.874
And I'll do it without so much
as blinking an eye.

43:50.169 --> 43:52.295
I don't know
what you did to the president.

43:52.296 --> 43:53.547
I don't wanna know.

43:55.591 --> 43:58.052
But Xavier and the kids?

43:59.970 --> 44:01.221
That's my family.

44:04.475 --> 44:06.101
Do not fuck with them.

44:09.897 --> 44:11.522
You think you're the only person here

44:11.523 --> 44:13.232
who knows how to shoot a gun?

44:13.233 --> 44:15.902
You think you're the only killer

44:15.903 --> 44:17.821
I brought down here just in case?

44:20.366 --> 44:21.992
You gonna send somebody for me?

44:28.123 --> 44:30.959
You better make sure
it's the biggest motherfucker you got.

44:42.888 --> 44:44.555
Alright, slim, show me something.

44:44.556 --> 44:46.474
You're going left, you're going right.

44:46.475 --> 44:49.143
- Ah. Ahh! Close.
-  Ohh!

44:49.144 --> 44:51.396
- Almost.
-  Oh. So close.

44:51.397 --> 44:52.981
So...

44:54.149 --> 44:56.025
Looks like you got a new friend, huh?

44:56.026 --> 44:58.152
And here he goes again.

44:58.153 --> 45:00.071
I could say the same for you.

45:02.616 --> 45:04.992
Guess things are changing, yeah?

45:06.870 --> 45:08.204
Yeah.

45:08.205 --> 45:12.167
-  Yes!
- Well, we can't only be sad forever.

45:13.168 --> 45:14.461
Can't we try?

45:15.003 --> 45:16.130
Haven't we been?

45:17.715 --> 45:19.257
Hey, Uncle Billy, watch this.

45:19.258 --> 45:20.592
Make it rain, baby.

45:22.636 --> 45:24.137
- Yeah!
-  That's what I'm talking about.

45:24.138 --> 45:27.099
Alright, guys, got something for you.

45:28.434 --> 45:29.642
Yeah, alright.

45:29.643 --> 45:31.352
-  Look at that.
- Alright, here you go.

45:31.353 --> 45:33.896
And don't tell your dad.

45:33.897 --> 45:35.231
Whoa-ho-ho.

45:35.232 --> 45:36.774
Here, man, take one of these.

45:36.775 --> 45:38.484
I'm good. Save it for the kids.

45:38.485 --> 45:40.446
No, take one. Come talk to me.

45:42.489 --> 45:43.990
-  Here we go.
-  J...

45:43.991 --> 45:47.077
...A-M...

45:48.579 --> 45:50.747
I didn't kill the prez, man,
you gotta believe that.

45:50.748 --> 45:52.583
I do.

45:54.668 --> 45:56.170
But...

45:57.004 --> 45:59.672
there's some things
you should know about me,

45:59.673 --> 46:02.259
about the things I've done that...

46:04.052 --> 46:06.472
I think might have to do
with what happened to our guy.

46:08.056 --> 46:11.267
- What things, man?
- Just listen, man.

46:11.268 --> 46:14.270
I've seen some shit in my fucked-up life,

46:14.271 --> 46:18.692
and I've met some of the scariest bastards
you could ever not wanna meet.

46:19.526 --> 46:22.695
But this Sinatra, she's a killer, X.

46:22.696 --> 46:23.906
Cold-blooded.

46:25.991 --> 46:28.409
- And I done some things.
-  One, two...

46:28.410 --> 46:30.077
- I've done some things for her.
-  Three!

46:30.078 --> 46:31.954
- Billy, what?
-  Uh-oh, mine's about to stop!

46:31.955 --> 46:34.832
No! No!

46:36.710 --> 46:38.420
Look, tomorrow, okay?

46:39.588 --> 46:41.506
I'll tell you everything, I swear to God.

46:41.507 --> 46:44.760
I just... if it's okay with you...

46:46.762 --> 46:49.181
just wanna be Uncle Billy
just one more night.

46:50.974 --> 46:52.976
- Okay?
- Okay.

46:54.394 --> 46:55.770
- Thanks, man.
-  Hey, Uncle Billy.

46:55.771 --> 46:57.104
Yeah.

46:57.105 --> 46:59.650
Thanks for the advice earlier.

47:00.442 --> 47:02.401
Ohh.

47:02.402 --> 47:05.322
- How'd it go?
- I shot my shot.

47:08.200 --> 47:09.785
I knew you would, shooter.

47:10.536 --> 47:12.746
- Mm, mm, mm!
- I'm proud of you.

47:13.413 --> 47:15.998
Hey, man, what kind of terrible advice
you giving my daughter?

47:15.999 --> 47:18.042
Oh man, nothing. No, I was just--

47:18.043 --> 47:19.919
I was telling her
about that friend of ours.

47:19.920 --> 47:22.505
- What friend is that?
- You know, that one lady.

47:22.506 --> 47:24.173
Um, what was her name?

47:24.174 --> 47:26.300
- Hm?
- From the Christmas party.

47:26.301 --> 47:28.010
Wasn't it Nunya?

47:28.011 --> 47:29.804
- Wasn't it Nunya?
- I think it was.

47:29.805 --> 47:31.180
-  What was her name?
- What was--

47:31.181 --> 47:33.641
Nunya, sweetest lady,
bakes those nice pies.

47:33.642 --> 47:37.186
Oh, that's right. Nunya Business.

47:37.187 --> 47:39.063
Hey, I love you guys.

47:39.064 --> 47:40.273
Love you too!

47:40.274 --> 47:43.067
-  Happy carnival!
-  Give me that ball, bruh.

47:43.068 --> 47:45.653
Hit me, hit me.

47:45.654 --> 47:47.698
Yeah!

47:51.368 --> 47:52.743
Babe, I'm home.

47:55.455 --> 47:56.540
Hey.

47:57.124 --> 47:59.417
I know today didn't go
how you wanted it to.

47:59.418 --> 48:01.295
We didn't get fake tattoos.

48:02.337 --> 48:05.215
We didn't do any rides.
We didn't even get a single sparkler.

48:09.803 --> 48:12.305
God, I am so easy to please.

48:12.306 --> 48:14.348
All those years of my parents
denying me affection

48:14.349 --> 48:16.434
really worked out well for you, huh?

48:16.435 --> 48:18.686
I'm grateful to them every single day.
