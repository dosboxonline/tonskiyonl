03:15.721 --> 03:17.930
You never did eat your lunch, did you?

03:18.015 --> 03:19.766
I better get back to the office.

03:19.850 --> 03:22.935
These extended lunch hours
give my boss excess acid.

03:23.020 --> 03:24.437
Why don't you call your boss and tell him

03:24.521 --> 03:26.856
you're taking the rest of the afternoon off?

03:26.940 --> 03:29.317
Friday anyway, and hot.

03:29.610 --> 03:33.571
What do I do with my free afternoon?
Walk you to the airport?

03:34.531 --> 03:36.908
Well, we could laze around here
a while longer.

03:38.368 --> 03:40.620
Checking-out time is 3:00 p. m.

03:41.121 --> 03:45.082
Hotels of this sort aren't interested
in you when you come in,

03:45.209 --> 03:47.210
but when your time is up...

03:47.294 --> 03:49.837
Oh, Sam, I hate having to be with you
in a place like this.

03:49.922 --> 03:51.631
I've heard of married couples
who deliberately spend

03:51.715 --> 03:52.882
an occasional night in a cheap hotel.

03:53.300 --> 03:57.261
When you're married you can do
a lot of things deliberately.

03:57.721 --> 04:00.348
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.

04:00.432 --> 04:03.226
Oh, Sam, this is the last time.

04:03.644 --> 04:06.062
- Yeah? For what?
- For this.

04:07.105 --> 04:10.399
For meeting you in secret
so we can be secretive.

04:11.026 --> 04:15.196
You come down here on business trips,
and we steal lunch hours.

04:16.281 --> 04:18.574
I wish you wouldn't even come.

04:19.284 --> 04:22.662
All right. What do we do instead?
Write each other lurid love letters?

04:22.746 --> 04:24.956
Oh, I have to go, Sam.

04:27.543 --> 04:30.086
- I can come down next week.
- No.

04:30.754 --> 04:35.091
Not even just to see you?
Have lunch, in public?

04:36.301 --> 04:39.595
Oh, we can see each other.
We can even have dinner.

04:40.639 --> 04:42.139
But respectably.

04:42.224 --> 04:45.017
In my house,
with my mother's picture on the mantel

04:45.102 --> 04:48.521
and my sister helping me broil
a big steak for three.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.523
And after the steak,

04:50.607 --> 04:53.192
do we send sister to the movies,
turn Mama's picture to the wall?

04:53.277 --> 04:54.360
Sam!

04:57.531 --> 04:58.906
All right.

05:05.622 --> 05:08.791
Marion, whenever it's possible,
I want to see you.

05:08.876 --> 05:12.128
And under any circumstances,
even respectability.

05:13.088 --> 05:16.382
You make respectability
sound disrespectful.

05:16.466 --> 05:18.050
Oh, no, I'm all for it.

05:18.135 --> 05:21.721
It requires patience, temperance,
a lot of sweating out.

05:22.306 --> 05:25.057
Otherwise, though, it's just hard work.

05:26.184 --> 05:30.730
But if I can see you and touch you,
even as simply as this, I won't mind.

05:33.317 --> 05:35.818
I'm tired of sweating for people
who aren't there.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.946
I sweat to pay off my father's debts,
and he's in his grave.

05:39.031 --> 05:40.239
I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony,

05:40.324 --> 05:44.035
and she's living on the other side
of the world somewhere.

05:45.829 --> 05:47.246
I pay, too.

05:48.624 --> 05:51.334
They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.

05:52.544 --> 05:55.755
A couple of years
and my debts will be paid off.

05:56.340 --> 05:58.424
If she ever remarries, the alimony stops.

05:58.508 --> 06:02.887
- I haven't even been married once yet.
- Yeah. But when you do, you'll swing.

06:02.971 --> 06:05.097
Oh, Sam, let's get married.

06:10.020 --> 06:14.523
Yeah. And live with me in a storeroom
behind a hardware store in Fairvale?

06:14.900 --> 06:17.735
We'll have lots of laughs. I'll tell you what.

06:17.819 --> 06:21.447
When I send my ex-wife her alimony,
you can lick the stamps.

06:21.531 --> 06:23.366
I'll lick the stamps.

06:32.459 --> 06:34.126
Marion, you want to cut this off,

06:34.211 --> 06:36.671
go out and find yourself
somebody available?

06:36.755 --> 06:38.547
I'm thinking of it.

06:42.177 --> 06:45.137
How could you even think a thing like that?

06:45.806 --> 06:48.683
- Don't miss your plane.
- Hey, we can leave together, can't we?

06:48.767 --> 06:51.727
I'm late and you have to put your shoes on.

07:06.118 --> 07:07.868
Is Mr Lowery back from lunch?

07:07.953 --> 07:10.371
He's lunching with the man
who's buying the Harris Street property.

07:10.455 --> 07:14.375
You know, the oil lease man.
That's why he's late. You got a headache?

07:14.459 --> 07:15.918
It'll pass.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.586
Headaches are like resolutions,

07:17.671 --> 07:19.630
you forget them
as soon as they stop hurting.

07:19.715 --> 07:22.800
Have you got some aspirin?
I've got something, not aspirin.

07:22.884 --> 07:25.553
My mother's doctor gave them to me
the day of my wedding.

07:25.637 --> 07:29.432
Teddy was furious when he found out
I'd taken tranquilisers.

07:30.100 --> 07:31.434
Any calls?

07:31.893 --> 07:35.813
Teddy called me.
My mother called to see if Teddy called.

07:35.897 --> 07:38.691
Oh, your sister called to say
she's going to Tucson to do some buying

07:38.775 --> 07:39.984
and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...

07:44.239 --> 07:45.906
Wow.

07:45.991 --> 07:48.117
It's as hot as fresh milk.

07:48.910 --> 07:53.581
Hey, you girls ought to get your boss
to air condition you up.

07:53.665 --> 07:55.041
He can afford it today.

07:56.501 --> 07:58.627
Marion, will you get the copies
of that deed ready for Mr Cassidy?

07:58.712 --> 08:02.173
- Yes, sir.
- Tomorrow's the day, my sweet little girl.

08:02.966 --> 08:05.801
Oh, not you. My daughter.

08:06.553 --> 08:07.887
A baby.

08:08.889 --> 08:13.642
And tomorrow she stands her sweet self
up there and gets married away from me.

08:14.770 --> 08:17.772
I want you to take a look at my baby.

08:20.650 --> 08:22.568
Eighteen years old

08:22.986 --> 08:26.822
and she never had an unhappy day
in any one of those years.

08:27.616 --> 08:29.867
Come on, Tom. My office is air conditioned.

08:29.951 --> 08:32.787
Do you know what I do about unhappiness?

08:33.705 --> 08:35.246
I buy it off.

08:35.664 --> 08:37.707
Are... Are you unhappy?

08:39.376 --> 08:41.087
Not inordinately.

08:42.923 --> 08:46.342
I'm buying this house
for my baby's wedding present.

08:47.552 --> 08:49.845
$40,000 cash.

08:51.723 --> 08:56.852
Now that's not buying happiness.
That's just buying off unhappiness.

08:59.439 --> 09:02.483
I never carry more than I can afford to lose.

09:03.360 --> 09:05.444
Count them!
- I declare!

09:05.529 --> 09:08.239
I don't. That's how I get to keep it.

09:09.074 --> 09:13.119
Tom, a cash transaction of this size
is most irregular.

09:13.203 --> 09:16.330
So what? It's my private money.

09:16.414 --> 09:17.748
Now it's yours.

09:17.833 --> 09:19.083
Suppose we put it in the safe,

09:19.167 --> 09:22.670
and then Monday morning
when you're feeling good...

09:22.754 --> 09:24.922
Oh, speaking of feeling good,

09:25.006 --> 09:28.134
where's that bottle you said
was in your desk?

09:28.218 --> 09:29.385
Uh-oh!

09:32.180 --> 09:36.517
You know, sometimes I can keep
my mouth shut.

09:41.648 --> 09:44.400
Lowery, I am dying of thirst-aroonie.

09:48.572 --> 09:50.614
I don't even want it in the office
over the weekend.

09:50.699 --> 09:52.908
Put it in the safe deposit box in the bank,

09:52.993 --> 09:55.077
and we'll get him to give us
a cheque on Monday instead.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.245
Yes.

10:01.793 --> 10:03.502
He was flirting with you.

10:03.587 --> 10:06.422
I guess he must've noticed
my wedding ring.

10:19.978 --> 10:21.270
Come in.

10:23.607 --> 10:27.526
The copies. Mr Lowery, if you don't mind,
I'd like to go right on home after the bank.

10:27.611 --> 10:29.862
- I have a slight...
- You go right on home.

10:29.946 --> 10:32.031
Because me and your boss are going out

10:32.115 --> 10:34.658
and get ourselves a little drinking done.
Right?

10:34.743 --> 10:37.870
- Of course. Do you feel ill?
- Just a headache.

10:37.954 --> 10:42.291
What you need is a weekend in Las Vegas,
the playground of the world.

10:42.375 --> 10:45.628
I'm going to spend this weekend in bed.
Thank you.

10:48.465 --> 10:52.051
Aren't you going to take the pills?
They'll knock that headache out.

10:52.135 --> 10:54.511
Can't buy off unhappiness with pills.

10:55.847 --> 11:00.559
I guess I'll go put this money in the bank
and then go home and sleep it off.

13:02.599 --> 13:05.851
Marion, what in the world...
What are you doing up here?

13:05.935 --> 13:08.812
Of course I'm glad to see you. I always am.

13:08.897 --> 13:10.689
What is it, Marion?

14:49.914 --> 14:51.498
Hold it there.

14:57.547 --> 14:59.214
In quite a hurry.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.384
Yes. I didn't intend to sleep so long.

15:02.469 --> 15:05.387
I almost had an accident last night
from sleepiness,

15:05.472 --> 15:09.057
- so I decided to pull over.
- You slept here all night?

15:09.893 --> 15:12.895
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes open.

15:13.271 --> 15:16.648
There are plenty of motels in this area.
You should've...

15:16.733 --> 15:18.484
I mean, just to be safe.

15:18.568 --> 15:23.405
I didn't intend to sleep all night.
I just pulled over. Have I broken any laws?

15:23.948 --> 15:26.366
- No, ma'am.
- Then I'm free to go?

15:28.036 --> 15:29.828
Is anything wrong?

15:30.914 --> 15:34.625
Of course not.
Am I acting as if there's something wrong?

15:34.709 --> 15:38.170
- Frankly, yes.
- Please, I'd like to go.

15:39.088 --> 15:41.924
- Well, is there?
- Is there what?

15:44.719 --> 15:46.637
I've told you there's nothing wrong,

15:46.721 --> 15:49.640
except that I'm in a hurry
and you're taking up my time.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.769
Now, just a moment.
Turn your motor off, please.

15:55.438 --> 15:57.439
May I see your licence?

16:00.193 --> 16:02.319
- Why?
- Please.

18:08.905 --> 18:10.906
Be with you in a second!

19:14.721 --> 19:16.888
- I'm in no mood for trouble.
- What?

19:16.973 --> 19:19.891
There's an old saying."The first customer
of the day is always the most trouble."

19:19.976 --> 19:21.601
But like I say, I'm in no mood for it,

19:21.686 --> 19:24.980
so I'm gonna treat you so fair and square
that you won't have one human reason...

19:25.064 --> 19:27.232
Can I trade my car in and take another?

19:27.316 --> 19:31.445
Do anything you have a mind to.
Being a woman, you will. That yours?

19:31.529 --> 19:33.822
Yes, it's... There's nothing wrong with it.

19:33.906 --> 19:36.408
- I just...
- Sick of the sight of it.

19:36.492 --> 19:37.617
Why don't you have a look around here

19:37.702 --> 19:39.119
and see if there's something
that strikes your eyes.

19:39.203 --> 19:41.204
And meanwhile, I'll have my mechanic
give yours the once-over.

19:41.289 --> 19:43.248
- You want some coffee? I was just about...
- No, thank you.

19:43.332 --> 19:45.709
I'm in a hurry
and I just wanna make a change.

19:45.793 --> 19:47.252
One thing people never ought to be

19:47.336 --> 19:49.296
when they're buying used cars
and that's in a hurry.

19:49.380 --> 19:53.300
But like I said, it's too nice a day to argue.
I'll shoot your car in the garage here.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.783
That's the one I'd have
picked for you myself.

20:17.867 --> 20:18.992
- How much?
- Go ahead.

20:19.076 --> 20:21.578
- Spin it around the block.
- It looks fine.

20:21.662 --> 20:23.622
How much would it be with my car?

20:23.706 --> 20:27.793
You mean you don't want the usual day
and a half to think it over?

20:27.877 --> 20:30.837
You are in a hurry, aren't you?
Somebody chasing you?

20:30.922 --> 20:32.881
Of course not. Please.

20:33.257 --> 20:37.677
Well, it's the first time the customer
ever high-pressured the salesman.

20:39.138 --> 20:40.889
I figure roughly

20:43.476 --> 20:45.602
your car plus $700.

20:46.604 --> 20:50.232
- $700.
- You always got time to argue money, huh?

20:51.442 --> 20:52.818
All right.

20:58.199 --> 21:00.325
I take it you can prove that car is yours.

21:00.409 --> 21:03.370
I mean, out-of-state licence and all.
You got your pink slip...

21:03.454 --> 21:07.249
I believe I have the necessary papers.
Is there a ladies' room?

21:07.333 --> 21:08.959
In the building.

21:20.179 --> 21:21.638
Over there.

22:18.613 --> 22:21.114
I think you better take it for a trial spin.

22:21.198 --> 22:23.783
I don't want any bad word of mouth
about California Charlie.

22:23.868 --> 22:26.870
I'd really rather not.
Can't we just settle this and...

22:26.954 --> 22:29.497
I might as well be perfectly
honest with you, ma'am.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.292
- It's not that I don't trust you, but...
- But what?

22:32.376 --> 22:34.210
Is there anything so terribly wrong

22:34.295 --> 22:37.255
about making a decision
and wanting to hurry?

22:37.506 --> 22:40.508
- Do you think I've stolen my car?
- No, ma'am.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.845
All right, let's go inside.

23:20.883 --> 23:22.092
Hey!

23:29.308 --> 23:31.601
Just put it in here, please.

23:34.563 --> 23:35.981
Thank you.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.157
Heck, Officer,

23:46.242 --> 23:47.450
that was the first time
I ever saw the customer

23:47.535 --> 23:49.744
high-pressure the salesman.

23:49.829 --> 23:51.705
Somebody chasing her?

23:51.789 --> 23:54.833
I betterhave a look
at those papers, Charlie.

23:54.917 --> 23:57.085
She look like a wrong one to you?

23:57.169 --> 23:58.420
acted like one.

23:59.338 --> 24:02.465
The only funny thing,
she paid me $700 in cash.

24:12.476 --> 24:16.312
- Yes, Mr Lowery.
- Caroline, Marion still isn't in?

24:16.397 --> 24:19.858
No, Mr Lowery, but then
she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.

24:19.942 --> 24:21.484
Buzz me the minute she comes in.

24:24.405 --> 24:26.865
And call her sister.
no one's answering at the house.

24:26.949 --> 24:29.325
I called her sister, Mr Lowery,
where she works,

24:29.410 --> 24:31.411
the Music Makers Music Store, you know,

24:31.495 --> 24:34.122
and she doesn't know where Marion is
any more than we do.

24:34.206 --> 24:35.373
You better run out to the house.

24:35.458 --> 24:38.001
She may be,
well, unable to answer the phone.

24:38.085 --> 24:40.962
Hersister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.

24:45.426 --> 24:47.385
No, I haven't the faintest idea.

24:47.470 --> 24:50.388
As I said, I last saw your sister
when she left this office on Friday.

24:50.473 --> 24:54.017
She said she didn't feel well and wanted
to leave early, and I said she could.

24:54.101 --> 24:57.103
That was the last I saw... Oh, wait a minute.

24:57.188 --> 25:00.023
I did see her some time later, driving...

25:00.900 --> 25:04.486
I think you'd better come over here
to my office, quick.

25:04.695 --> 25:07.155
Caroline, get Mr Cassidy for me.

25:09.992 --> 25:13.453
After all, Cassidy, I told you, all that cash!

25:13.954 --> 25:16.122
I'm not taking the responsibility.

25:16.207 --> 25:17.749
Oh, for heaven's sake.

25:17.833 --> 25:20.794
A girl works for you for 10 years,
you trust her.

25:20.878 --> 25:22.837
All right, yes, you better come over.

25:25.257 --> 25:28.301
Well, I ain't about
to kiss off $40,000!

25:28.385 --> 25:32.430
I'll get it back, and if any of it's missing,
I'll replace it with her fine, soft flesh!

25:32.515 --> 25:35.433
- I'll track her, never you doubt it.
Hold on, Cassidy.

25:35.518 --> 25:40.939
I still can't believe...
It must be some kind of a mystery. I can't...

25:41.023 --> 25:44.234
You checked with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her, no?

25:44.318 --> 25:48.321
You still trusting? Hot creepers!
She sat there while I dumped it out!

25:48.405 --> 25:52.867
Hardly even looked at it. Planning.
And even flirting with me!

28:18.180 --> 28:21.015
Gee, I'm sorry I didn't hear you
in all this rain.

28:21.100 --> 28:22.892
Go ahead in, please.

28:28.357 --> 28:31.025
- Dirty night.
- You have a vacancy?

28:31.110 --> 28:35.029
Oh, we have 12 vacancies.
Twelve cabins, 12 vacancies.

28:35.447 --> 28:38.032
They... They moved away the highway.

28:38.701 --> 28:41.703
Oh, I thought I'd gotten off the main road.

28:42.830 --> 28:43.955
I knew you must have.

28:44.039 --> 28:47.583
Nobody ever stops here any more
unless they've done that.

28:47.960 --> 28:51.963
But there's no sense dwelling on our losses.

28:52.047 --> 28:56.217
We just keep on lighting the lights
and following the formalities.

29:00.222 --> 29:03.224
Your home address.
Oh, just the town will do.

29:07.479 --> 29:08.938
Los Angeles.

29:16.405 --> 29:18.823
Cabin One.
It's closer in case you want anything.

29:18.907 --> 29:20.116
Right next to the office.

29:20.200 --> 29:23.161
I want sleep more than anything else,
except maybe food.

29:23.245 --> 29:26.998
Well, there's a big diner about 10 miles
up the road, just outside of Fairvale.

29:27.082 --> 29:31.252
- Am I that close to Fairvale?
- Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

29:50.397 --> 29:52.440
Boy, it's stuffy in here.

29:58.113 --> 30:00.698
Well, the mattress is soft

30:01.533 --> 30:05.411
and there's hangers in the closet and
stationery with Bates Motel printed on it

30:05.496 --> 30:08.873
in case you wanna make
your friends back home feel envious.

30:08.957 --> 30:10.458
And the...

30:12.878 --> 30:15.213
- Over there.
- The bathroom.

30:15.714 --> 30:16.839
Yeah.

30:17.758 --> 30:21.928
Well, if you want anything,
just tap on the wall.

30:22.012 --> 30:24.305
- I'll be in the office.
- Thank you, Mr Bates.

30:24.390 --> 30:25.973
Norman Bates.

30:29.645 --> 30:32.897
You're not really gonna go out again
and drive up to the diner, are you?

30:32.981 --> 30:34.232
No.

30:34.316 --> 30:37.235
Well, then would you do me a favour?
Would you have dinner with me?

30:37.319 --> 30:38.778
I was just about to myself.

30:38.862 --> 30:41.197
You know, nothing special,
just sandwiches and milk.

30:41.281 --> 30:44.951
But I'd like it very much
if you'd come up to the house.

30:46.161 --> 30:49.831
I don't set a fancy table,
but the kitchen's awful homey.

30:50.582 --> 30:52.333
- I'd like to.
- All right.

30:52.418 --> 30:55.086
You get yourself settled
and take off your wet shoes,

30:55.170 --> 30:56.921
and I'll be back as soon as it's ready.

30:57.005 --> 30:58.214
Okay.

30:58.841 --> 31:00.591
With my... With my trusty umbrella.

32:22.758 --> 32:25.343
No! I tell you no!

32:25.427 --> 32:28.721
I won't have you bringing
strange young girls in for supper!

32:28.805 --> 32:32.141
By candlelight, I suppose,
in the cheap, erotic fashion

32:32.226 --> 32:34.560
of young men with cheap, erotic minds!

32:34.645 --> 32:36.270
Mother, please.

32:36.522 --> 32:39.524
And then what, after supper?
Music? Whispers?

32:39.608 --> 32:42.902
Mother, she's just a stranger.
She's hungry and it's raining out.

32:42.986 --> 32:48.366
"Mother, she's just a stranger."
As if men don't desire strangers. As if...

32:48.450 --> 32:52.662
I refuse to speak of
disgusting things, because they disgust me!

32:52.829 --> 32:55.039
You understand, boy? Go on.

32:55.290 --> 32:58.292
Go tell her she'll not be appeasing
her ugly appetite

32:58.377 --> 33:00.795
with my food or my son!

33:01.213 --> 33:04.215
Or do I have to tell her
'cause you don't have the guts?

33:04.299 --> 33:07.885
- Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Shut up! Shut up!

33:50.053 --> 33:52.847
- I've caused you some trouble.
- No.

33:54.182 --> 33:56.350
Mother... My mother...

33:57.019 --> 33:58.853
What is the phrase?

33:59.771 --> 34:02.023
She isn't quite herself today.

34:02.858 --> 34:06.652
You shouldn't have bothered.
I really don't have that much of an appetite.

34:08.655 --> 34:10.197
Oh, I'm sorry.

34:12.826 --> 34:15.828
I wish you could apologise for other people.

34:16.455 --> 34:18.164
Don't worry about it.

34:18.248 --> 34:21.833
But as long as you've fixed a supper,
we may as well eat it.

34:32.387 --> 34:36.891
It might be nicer and warmer in the office.

34:51.239 --> 34:53.032
Well, it stopped raining.

34:53.116 --> 34:55.659
Eating in an office is just too officious.

34:56.911 --> 34:59.622
- I have the parlour back here.
- All right.

35:15.222 --> 35:17.765
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

35:21.103 --> 35:22.937
You're very kind.

35:24.272 --> 35:27.274
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Go ahead.

35:33.949 --> 35:36.117
You... You eat like a bird.

35:37.661 --> 35:39.704
And you'd know, of course.

35:40.455 --> 35:41.997
No, not really.

35:42.582 --> 35:45.459
Anyway, I hear the expression
"Eats like a bird"

35:45.544 --> 35:49.630
is really a false... Falsity.

35:50.549 --> 35:53.426
Because birds really eat a tremendous lot.

35:56.263 --> 35:59.598
But I don't really know
anything about birds.

35:59.683 --> 36:01.517
My hobby is stuffing things.

36:01.601 --> 36:03.436
You know, taxidermy.

36:04.271 --> 36:07.481
And I guess
I'd just rather stuff birds because

36:08.108 --> 36:10.735
I hate the look of beasts
when they're stuffed.

36:10.819 --> 36:12.778
You know, foxes and chimps.

36:12.863 --> 36:16.782
Some people even stuff dogs and cats,
but, oh, I can't do that.

36:17.367 --> 36:19.785
I think only birds look
well stuffed because...

36:19.870 --> 36:23.330
Well, because they're
kind of passive to begin with.

36:23.999 --> 36:26.792
It's a strange hobby. Curious.

36:27.502 --> 36:30.254
- Uncommon, too.
- Oh, I imagine so.

36:30.881 --> 36:34.341
And it's not as expensive as you'd think.
It's cheap, really.

36:34.426 --> 36:36.969
You know, needles and thread, sawdust.

36:37.053 --> 36:39.805
The chemicals are the only thing
that cost anything.

36:39.890 --> 36:41.974
A man should have a hobby.

36:42.684 --> 36:46.562
Well, it's... It's more than a hobby.

36:48.732 --> 36:51.942
A hobby's supposed to pass the time,
not fill it.

36:52.736 --> 36:54.653
Is your time so empty?

36:54.738 --> 36:55.863
No.

36:57.574 --> 36:59.825
Well, I run the office

36:59.910 --> 37:02.328
and tend the cabins and grounds

37:02.412 --> 37:05.122
and do little errands for my mother.

37:05.207 --> 37:08.542
The ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.

37:09.127 --> 37:11.253
Do you go out with friends?

37:14.216 --> 37:17.134
Well, a boy's best friend is his mother.

37:19.429 --> 37:23.349
You've never had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

37:25.393 --> 37:28.562
- Only my share.
- Where are you going?

37:31.525 --> 37:33.442
I didn't mean to pry.

37:33.527 --> 37:35.945
I'm looking for a private island.

37:37.322 --> 37:39.698
What are you running away from?

37:42.244 --> 37:44.286
- Why do you ask that?
- I don't know.

37:46.248 --> 37:48.874
People never run away from anything.

37:51.586 --> 37:55.214
The rain didn't last long, did it?
You know what I think?

37:56.424 --> 37:58.008
I think that

38:00.220 --> 38:02.721
we're all in our private traps,

38:03.431 --> 38:06.767
clamped in them,
and none of us can ever get out.

38:09.145 --> 38:11.355
We scratch and claw,

38:12.148 --> 38:14.984
but only at the air, only at each other.

38:15.861 --> 38:19.446
And for all of it, we never budge an inch.

38:20.615 --> 38:23.826
Sometimes we deliberately step
into those traps.

38:26.162 --> 38:29.248
I was born in mine. I don't mind it any more.

38:29.332 --> 38:32.001
Oh, but you should. You should mind it.

38:32.085 --> 38:34.295
Oh, I do, but I say I don't.

38:37.507 --> 38:41.468
You know, if anyone ever
talked to me the way I heard,

38:42.137 --> 38:44.305
the way she spoke to you...

38:46.182 --> 38:49.101
Sometimes when she talks to me like that,

38:49.686 --> 38:54.148
I feel I'd like to go up there
and curse her and leave her forever.

38:54.816 --> 38:56.650
Or at least defy her.

39:01.323 --> 39:03.073
But I know I can't.

39:04.784 --> 39:06.160
She's ill.

39:06.661 --> 39:08.495
She sounded strong.

39:09.623 --> 39:11.332
No, I mean ill.

39:13.585 --> 39:17.254
She had to raise me all by herself,
after my father died.

39:17.339 --> 39:20.925
I was only five and it must've been
quite a strain for her.

39:21.009 --> 39:23.469
I mean, she didn't have to go to work
or anything like that.

39:23.553 --> 39:25.679
He left her a little money.

39:26.139 --> 39:30.017
Anyway, a few years ago,
Mother met this man.

39:30.602 --> 39:33.854
And he talked her into building this motel.

39:33.939 --> 39:36.273
He could have talked her into anything.

39:36.358 --> 39:40.611
And when he died, too,
it was just too great a shock for her.

39:42.030 --> 39:43.948
And the way he died...

39:47.369 --> 39:50.621
I guess it's nothing to talk
about while you're eating.

39:50.705 --> 39:55.167
Anyway, it was just too great a loss for her.
She had nothing left.

39:56.878 --> 39:58.337
Except you.

39:59.798 --> 40:02.883
Well, a son is a poor substitute for a lover.

40:03.843 --> 40:05.719
Why don't you go away?

40:07.263 --> 40:09.556
To a private island, like you?

40:13.061 --> 40:15.562
No, not like me.

40:16.606 --> 40:19.733
I couldn't do that. Who'd look after her?

40:21.277 --> 40:23.362
She'd be alone up there.

40:24.239 --> 40:26.156
Her fire would go out.

40:26.908 --> 40:29.410
It'd be cold and damp like a grave.

40:30.996 --> 40:32.746
If you love someone,

40:32.831 --> 40:36.083
you don't do that to them,
even if you hate them.

40:37.085 --> 40:39.628
You understand, I don't hate her.

40:41.506 --> 40:43.549
I hate what she's become.

40:44.551 --> 40:46.343
I hate the illness.

40:47.762 --> 40:50.472
Wouldn't it be better if you put her

40:52.183 --> 40:53.767
someplace...

40:57.063 --> 41:00.149
You mean an institution? A madhouse?

41:04.279 --> 41:07.781
People always call a madhouse
"someplace," don't they?

41:07.866 --> 41:09.950
Put her in someplace.

41:11.453 --> 41:14.496
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it to sound uncaring.

41:15.415 --> 41:17.833
What do you know about caring?

41:17.917 --> 41:21.045
Have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places?

41:21.129 --> 41:23.380
The laughing and the tears

41:24.132 --> 41:26.925
and the cruel eyes studying you.

41:27.010 --> 41:28.719
My mother there?

41:30.930 --> 41:32.806
But she's harmless.

41:35.435 --> 41:38.645
She's as harmless
as one of those stuffed birds.

41:39.814 --> 41:41.148
I am sorry.

41:41.983 --> 41:45.944
I only felt... It seems she's hurting you.

41:47.614 --> 41:50.574
- I meant well.
- People always mean well.

41:51.826 --> 41:54.119
They cluck their thick tongues
and shake their heads

41:54.204 --> 41:56.830
and suggest, oh, so very delicately.

42:04.255 --> 42:06.840
Of course, I've suggested it myself.

42:08.510 --> 42:10.969
But I hate to even think about it.

42:11.721 --> 42:13.222
She needs me.

42:17.435 --> 42:19.603
It's not as if she were

42:19.687 --> 42:22.481
a maniac, a raving thing.

42:25.026 --> 42:27.945
She just goes a little mad sometimes.

42:30.990 --> 42:33.408
We all go a little mad sometimes.

42:36.121 --> 42:37.538
Haven't you?

42:39.666 --> 42:40.749
Yes.

42:41.918 --> 42:44.753
Sometimes just one time can be enough.

42:46.548 --> 42:47.881
Thank you.

42:48.925 --> 42:51.051
Thank you, Norman.

42:51.136 --> 42:52.386
Norman.

42:53.680 --> 42:57.516
Oh, you're not going back
to your room already?

42:58.017 --> 42:59.476
I'm very tired.

42:59.561 --> 43:03.397
And I have a long drive tomorrow,
all the way back to Phoenix.

43:03.773 --> 43:05.065
Really?

43:05.984 --> 43:08.902
I stepped into a private trap back there

43:09.612 --> 43:13.365
and I'd like to go back
and try to pull myself out of it

43:15.160 --> 43:16.660
before it's too late for me, too.

43:16.744 --> 43:19.538
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to stay just a little while longer?

43:19.622 --> 43:21.540
Just for talk?

43:22.000 --> 43:23.834
Oh, I'd like to, but...

43:23.918 --> 43:25.169
All right.

43:25.253 --> 43:28.881
Well, I'll see you in the morning.
I'll bring you some breakfast, all right?

43:28.965 --> 43:31.758
- What time?
- Very early. Dawn.

43:32.343 --> 43:33.802
All right, Miss...

43:33.887 --> 43:36.180
- Crane.
- Crane. That's it.

43:36.264 --> 43:37.723
Good night.

47:45.346 --> 47:46.596
No!

47:49.183 --> 47:50.267
No!

49:53.140 --> 49:55.517
Mother! Oh, God, Mother!

49:55.601 --> 49:57.477
Blood! Blood!

01:00:25.189 --> 01:00:27.106
I've tried many brands.

01:00:27.774 --> 01:00:31.777
So far, of those I've used,
I haven't had much luck with any of them.

01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:34.197
Let's see what they say about this one.

01:00:34.281 --> 01:00:36.574
They tell you what its ingredients are

01:00:36.658 --> 01:00:40.745
and how it's guaranteed to exterminate
every insect in the world,

01:00:41.288 --> 01:00:43.873
but they do not tell you
whether or not it's painless.

01:00:43.957 --> 01:00:47.668
And I say, insect or man,
death should always be painless.

01:00:48.462 --> 01:00:53.633
I suppose, this one seems to claim more
and better qualities than lots of the others.

01:01:04.478 --> 01:01:05.645
Sam?

01:01:06.146 --> 01:01:08.648
Sam! Lady wants to see you.

01:01:14.988 --> 01:01:17.406
- Yes, miss?
- I'm Marion's sister.

01:01:17.991 --> 01:01:20.534
- Oh, sure. Lila.
- Is Marion here?

01:01:22.246 --> 01:01:23.663
- Well, of course not.
Thank you.

01:01:23.747 --> 01:01:25.498
Something wrong?

01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:30.503
She left home on Friday.

01:01:30.587 --> 01:01:34.257
I was in Tucson over the weekend
and I haven't heard from her since.

01:01:34.341 --> 01:01:36.217
Not even a phone call.

01:01:36.843 --> 01:01:39.929
Look, if you two are in this thing together,
I don't care, it's none of my business,

01:01:40.013 --> 01:01:42.098
but I want to talk to Marion
and I want her to tell me

01:01:42.182 --> 01:01:43.766
it's none of my business and then I'll go...

01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:47.144
Bob, run out and get yourself
some lunch, will you?

01:01:47.229 --> 01:01:51.190
- That's okay, Sam. I brought it with me.
- Run out and eat it.

01:01:55.988 --> 01:01:58.906
Now, what thing
could we be in together?

01:01:59.324 --> 01:02:01.242
Sorry about the tears.

01:02:01.952 --> 01:02:04.704
Well, is Marion in trouble? What is it?

01:02:05.122 --> 01:02:07.873
Let's all talk about Marion, shall we?

01:02:11.545 --> 01:02:13.504
Who are you, friend?

01:02:13.588 --> 01:02:15.798
My name is Arbogast, friend.

01:02:15.882 --> 01:02:18.009
I'm a private investigator.

01:02:18.677 --> 01:02:21.929
- Where is she, Miss Crane?
- I don't know you.

01:02:22.389 --> 01:02:26.309
Why, I know you don't, because if you did,
I wouldn't be able to follow you.

01:02:26.393 --> 01:02:28.602
What's your interest in this?

01:02:29.146 --> 01:02:31.647
Well, $40,000.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.318
- $40,000?
- That's right.

01:02:39.072 --> 01:02:41.449
Well, one of you'd better tell me
what's going on, and tell me fast.

01:02:41.533 --> 01:02:43.743
- I can take just so much of this...
- Now, take it easy, friend.

01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:48.414
Take it easy.
It's just that your girlfriend stole $40,000.

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:50.875
What are you talking about? What is this?

01:02:50.959 --> 01:02:55.129
She was supposed to bank it on Friday
for her boss and she didn't.

01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:58.841
- And no one has seen her since.
- Someone has seen her.

01:02:58.925 --> 01:03:01.969
Someone always sees a girl with $40,000.

01:03:02.054 --> 01:03:04.805
Sam, they don't want to prosecute,
they just want the money back.

01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:07.850
- Sam, if she's here...
- She isn't. She isn't.

01:03:07.934 --> 01:03:09.602
Miss Crane, can I ask you a question?

01:03:09.686 --> 01:03:12.438
Did you come up here on just a hunch
and nothing more?

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:14.732
Not even a hunch. Just hope.

01:03:14.816 --> 01:03:18.402
Well, with a little checking
I could get to believe you.

01:03:18.779 --> 01:03:21.280
I don't care if you believe me or not.

01:03:21.365 --> 01:03:24.700
All I want to do is see Marion
before she gets in this too deeply.

01:03:24.785 --> 01:03:28.245
Did you check in Phoenix? Hospitals?
Maybe she had an accident, or a holdup.

01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:30.206
No, she was seen leaving town
in her own car,

01:03:30.290 --> 01:03:32.583
by her employer, I might add.

01:03:33.001 --> 01:03:35.294
I can't believe it. Can you?

01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:39.507
Well, you know,
we're always quickest to doubt people

01:03:39.591 --> 01:03:42.051
who have a reputation for being honest.

01:03:42.135 --> 01:03:44.428
I think she's here, Miss Crane.

01:03:44.513 --> 01:03:46.680
Where there's a boyfriend...

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:48.974
Well, she's not back there
with the nuts and bolts,

01:03:49.059 --> 01:03:51.811
but she's here, in this town somewhere.

01:03:52.270 --> 01:03:54.772
I'll find her. I'll be seeing you.

01:04:31.977 --> 01:04:33.853
- Evening.
- Evening.

01:04:33.937 --> 01:04:35.688
I almost drove right past.

01:04:35.772 --> 01:04:38.816
I'm always forgetting to turn the sign on,
but we do have a vacancy.

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:41.902
Twelve, in fact.
Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies. Candy?

01:04:41.987 --> 01:04:43.529
No, thanks.

01:04:43.613 --> 01:04:46.657
Last two days, I've been to so many
motels my eyes are bleary with neon,

01:04:46.741 --> 01:04:50.286
but, you know, this is the first place
that looks like it's hiding from the world.

01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:53.247
Well, I'll tell you the truth.
I didn't really forget to turn the sign on.

01:04:53.331 --> 01:04:56.584
Just doesn't seem
like any use any more, you know.

01:04:57.586 --> 01:05:00.463
See, that used to be
the main highway right there.

01:05:00.547 --> 01:05:01.797
Well, wanna come in and register?

01:05:01.882 --> 01:05:03.340
No, no, sit down. I don't wanna trouble you.

01:05:03.425 --> 01:05:06.635
- I just wanna ask a few questions.
- No, that's no trouble. Today's linen day.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:09.305
I always change the beds here once a week
whether they've been used or not.

01:05:09.389 --> 01:05:11.807
Hate the smell of dampness, don't you?
It's such a...

01:05:11.892 --> 01:05:14.643
I don't know, creepy smell. Come on.

01:05:15.937 --> 01:05:17.897
You out to buy a motel?

01:05:19.566 --> 01:05:20.733
No.

01:05:21.234 --> 01:05:22.735
Reason I ask, you said you'd seen so many

01:05:22.819 --> 01:05:25.988
in the past couple of days,
I thought maybe you...

01:05:26.072 --> 01:05:28.699
What... What was it you wanted to ask?

01:05:28.783 --> 01:05:31.577
Well, you see,
I'm looking for a missing person.

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:34.914
My name's Arbogast.
I'm a private investigator.

01:05:34.998 --> 01:05:36.832
I've been trying to trace a girl

01:05:36.917 --> 01:05:40.669
that's been missing for, oh,
about a week now from Phoenix.

01:05:40.754 --> 01:05:43.297
It's a private matter.
The family wants to forgive her.

01:05:43.381 --> 01:05:45.508
She's not in any trouble.

01:05:45.967 --> 01:05:48.761
I didn't think the police went looking
for people who aren't in trouble.

01:05:48.845 --> 01:05:50.971
- I'm not the police.
- Oh, yeah.

01:05:51.056 --> 01:05:52.890
We have reason to believe
that she came along this way.

01:05:52.974 --> 01:05:55.434
May have stopped in the area.
Did she stop here?

01:05:55.519 --> 01:05:58.103
Well, no one's stopped here
for a couple of weeks.

01:05:58.188 --> 01:06:00.523
Would you mind looking at the picture
before committing yourself?

01:06:00.607 --> 01:06:01.857
Commit myself?

01:06:01.942 --> 01:06:05.819
- You sure talk like a policeman.
- Look at the picture, please.

01:06:06.488 --> 01:06:07.530
Mmm-mmm.

01:06:07.614 --> 01:06:09.323
- Sure?
- Yeah.

01:06:10.242 --> 01:06:12.535
Well, she may have used an alias.

01:06:12.619 --> 01:06:14.078
Marion Crane's her real name,

01:06:14.162 --> 01:06:17.414
but she could've registered
under a different one.

01:06:17.958 --> 01:06:22.002
Well, I tell you, I don't even much bother
with guests registering any more.

01:06:22.087 --> 01:06:24.755
You know, one by one,
you drop the formalities.

01:06:24.839 --> 01:06:27.216
I shouldn't even bother
changing the sheets,

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:29.552
but old habits die hard.

01:06:30.345 --> 01:06:31.428
Which reminds me...

01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:35.307
- What's that?
- It's the light. The sign.

01:06:35.767 --> 01:06:38.561
We had a couple last week,
said if the thing hadn't been on,

01:06:38.645 --> 01:06:40.729
they would've thought
this was an old, deserted...

01:06:40.814 --> 01:06:43.107
Well, you see, that's exactly my point.

01:06:43.191 --> 01:06:45.067
You said that nobody'd been here
for a couple weeks,

01:06:45.151 --> 01:06:47.945
and there's a couple came by
and didn't know that you were open.

01:06:48.029 --> 01:06:49.029
Yeah.

01:06:49.531 --> 01:06:51.407
Well, as you say, old habits die hard.

01:06:51.491 --> 01:06:54.410
It's possible, this girl could've registered
under another name.

01:06:54.494 --> 01:06:56.120
Do you mind if I look at your book?

01:06:56.204 --> 01:06:58.163
- No.
- Thank you.

01:07:01.251 --> 01:07:02.418
All right.

01:07:02.502 --> 01:07:04.753
I'll get the date somewhere.

01:07:06.214 --> 01:07:07.840
See, there's nobody.

01:07:07.924 --> 01:07:11.677
Let's see now, I have a sample of her
handwriting here.

01:07:13.513 --> 01:07:14.805
Oh, yes.

01:07:15.724 --> 01:07:17.141
Here we are.

01:07:17.475 --> 01:07:20.436
Marie Samuels. That's an interesting alias.

01:07:21.479 --> 01:07:23.897
- Is that her?
- Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

01:07:23.982 --> 01:07:25.983
Marie, Marion.

01:07:26.067 --> 01:07:28.736
Samuels. Her boyfriend's name is Sam.

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:29.820
Mmm-hmm.

01:07:30.238 --> 01:07:32.740
Was she in disguise, by any chance?

01:07:34.284 --> 01:07:37.661
- Wanna check the picture again?
- Look, I wasn't lying to you, Mr...

01:07:37.746 --> 01:07:39.788
Oh, I know that. I know you wouldn't lie.

01:07:39.873 --> 01:07:41.749
You know, it's tough keeping track
of the time around here.

01:07:41.833 --> 01:07:43.584
Oh, I know, I know.

01:07:44.377 --> 01:07:45.961
Oh, yeah.

01:07:46.046 --> 01:07:48.213
Well, it was raining

01:07:49.507 --> 01:07:51.258
and her hair was all wet.

01:07:51.343 --> 01:07:54.053
I tell you, it's not really
a very good picture of her either.

01:07:54.137 --> 01:07:55.763
No, I guess not.

01:07:55.847 --> 01:07:57.348
Tell me all about her.

01:07:57.432 --> 01:07:58.724
Well,

01:07:59.184 --> 01:08:03.437
she arrived rather late one night,
and she went straight to sleep

01:08:03.521 --> 01:08:06.148
and left early the next morning.

01:08:06.232 --> 01:08:09.360
- How early?
- Oh, very early.

01:08:09.444 --> 01:08:12.655
Mmm-hmm. Which morning was that?

01:08:12.739 --> 01:08:13.989
The...

01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:19.411
- The next morning. Sunday.
- I see.

01:08:20.372 --> 01:08:22.413
- Did anyone meet her here?
- No.

01:08:22.499 --> 01:08:25.417
- Did she arrive with anyone?
- No.

01:08:25.877 --> 01:08:28.002
- Did she make any phone calls or...
- No.

01:08:28.087 --> 01:08:29.421
Locally?

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:32.758
Did you spend the night with her?

01:08:33.009 --> 01:08:34.259
No.

01:08:34.344 --> 01:08:38.138
Well then, how would you know
that she didn't make any phone calls?

01:08:41.850 --> 01:08:43.810
Well, she was very tired and...

01:08:43.895 --> 01:08:47.189
See, now I'm starting to remember.

01:08:47.273 --> 01:08:48.857
I'm making a mental picture of it in my mind.

01:08:48.942 --> 01:08:50.818
You know, if you make a mental
picturisation of something...

01:08:50.902 --> 01:08:53.529
That's right. That's right. Take your time.

01:08:53.613 --> 01:08:55.948
She was... She was sitting back there...

01:08:56.032 --> 01:08:58.951
No, no, she was standing back there
with a sandwich in her hand

01:08:59.035 --> 01:09:00.703
and she said she had to go to sleep early

01:09:00.787 --> 01:09:05.791
because she had a long drive ahead of her.

01:09:06.417 --> 01:09:08.377
- Back where?
- Back where she came from.

01:09:08.461 --> 01:09:11.255
No, you said before that she was
sitting back there... Standing back there...

01:09:11.339 --> 01:09:13.799
Yes, back in my parlour there.

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:16.009
She was very hungry
and I made her a sandwich

01:09:16.094 --> 01:09:21.515
and then she said that she was tired
and she had to go right to bed.

01:09:21.599 --> 01:09:23.767
I see. How did she pay you?

01:09:23.852 --> 01:09:25.185
- Cash? Cheque?
- Cash.

01:09:25.270 --> 01:09:26.603
Cash, huh?

01:09:27.689 --> 01:09:31.358
- And after she left, she didn't come back?
- Well, why should she?

01:09:31.443 --> 01:09:32.443
Yeah.

01:09:37.073 --> 01:09:40.158
Well, Mr Arbogast, I guess that's about it.

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:43.495
I've got some work to do, if you don't mind.

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:45.581
Well, to tell you the truth, I do mind.

01:09:45.665 --> 01:09:49.792
You see, if it doesn't jell, it isn't aspic,
and this ain't jelling.

01:09:49.877 --> 01:09:52.962
It's not coming together.
Something's missing.

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:56.884
Well, I don't know
what you could expect me to know.

01:09:56.968 --> 01:09:58.427
People just come and go, you know.

01:09:58.511 --> 01:10:02.139
- That's right. She isn't still here, is she?
- No.

01:10:04.184 --> 01:10:07.144
If I wanted to check the cabins,
all 12 of them,

01:10:07.228 --> 01:10:08.479
I'd need a warrant, wouldn't I?

01:10:08.563 --> 01:10:11.440
Listen, if you don't believe me, come on
with me. You can help me change beds.

01:10:11.524 --> 01:10:14.109
- Okay?
- No, thanks.

01:10:31.878 --> 01:10:33.545
Change your mind?

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:40.886
You know, I... I think I must have one
of those faces you just can't help believing.

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:42.763
- Is anyone at home?
- No.

01:10:42.847 --> 01:10:45.140
Oh? There's somebody
sitting up in the window.

01:10:45.225 --> 01:10:47.601
- No, no, there isn't.
- Sure, go ahead. Take a look.

01:10:47.685 --> 01:10:49.645
Oh, that must be my mother.

01:10:49.729 --> 01:10:52.189
She's an invalid.

01:10:52.273 --> 01:10:54.274
It's practically like living alone.

01:10:54.359 --> 01:10:55.859
Oh, I see.

01:10:57.070 --> 01:11:01.490
Now, if this girl, Marion Crane, were here,
you wouldn't be hiding her, would you?

01:11:01.574 --> 01:11:03.909
- No.
- Not even if she paid you well?

01:11:03.993 --> 01:11:05.077
No.

01:11:05.745 --> 01:11:10.833
Let's just say, just for the sake of argument,
that she wanted you to gallantly protect her.

01:11:10.917 --> 01:11:12.793
You'd know that you were being used.

01:11:12.877 --> 01:11:14.169
You wouldn't be made a fool of, would you?

01:11:14.254 --> 01:11:15.838
- But I'm not a fool.
- Well, I...

01:11:15.922 --> 01:11:18.966
And I'm not capable of being fooled,
not even by a woman.

01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:21.468
- Well, this is not a slur on your manhood.
- Let's put it this way.

01:11:21.553 --> 01:11:25.430
She might have fooled me,
but she didn't fool my mother.

01:11:25.515 --> 01:11:27.432
Well, then your mother met her.
Could I talk to your mother?

01:11:27.517 --> 01:11:30.185
No. As I told you, she's confined.

01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:31.520
Yes, but just for a few minutes. That's all.

01:11:31.604 --> 01:11:33.689
There might be some hint
that you missed out on.

01:11:33.773 --> 01:11:36.108
You know, sick old women
are usually pretty sharp.

01:11:36.192 --> 01:11:39.862
- Mr Arbogast... I think I've...
- Just for a moment. I wouldn't disturb her.

01:11:39.946 --> 01:11:42.781
- I think I've talked to you all I want to.
- Yes, but just for...

01:11:42.866 --> 01:11:45.158
I think it'd be much better if you left now.
Thanks.

01:11:46.119 --> 01:11:47.995
Well, all right.

01:11:48.746 --> 01:11:52.040
You sure would save me a lot of leg work
if you'd let me talk to her.

01:11:52.125 --> 01:11:53.542
- Would I need a warrant for that, too?
- Sure.

01:11:53.626 --> 01:11:54.626
Uh-huh.

01:11:55.587 --> 01:11:57.796
All right. Thanks anyway.

01:12:51.976 --> 01:12:55.062
Hello, Loomis. This is Arbogast.
Is Lila there?

01:12:55.438 --> 01:12:57.606
Okay. Let me talk to her, please.

01:12:58.942 --> 01:13:00.400
Hello, Lila.

01:13:01.069 --> 01:13:03.862
Lila, listen. Marion was up here.

01:13:04.864 --> 01:13:07.574
Yes, she spent last Saturday night
at the Bates Motel.

01:13:07.659 --> 01:13:09.451
It's right out here on the old highway.

01:13:09.535 --> 01:13:12.996
I even know what cabin she was in.
It was number one.

01:13:13.498 --> 01:13:17.793
Well, this young fella that runs the place
said that she just spent the night,

01:13:17.877 --> 01:13:20.379
left the next day and that was it.

01:13:22.882 --> 01:13:24.549
No, not exactly.

01:13:25.718 --> 01:13:30.138
Well, I did question him, believe me,
but I think I got all there was to get.

01:13:30.223 --> 01:13:33.392
I'll just have to pick up the pieces from here.

01:13:33.851 --> 01:13:37.437
Well, I tell you,
I don't feel entirely satisfied...

01:13:37.522 --> 01:13:39.856
See, this boy had a sick old mother.

01:13:39.941 --> 01:13:42.859
I think she saw Marion and talked to her.

01:13:42.944 --> 01:13:46.196
No. No, unfortunately,
he wouldn't let me see her.

01:13:46.614 --> 01:13:50.409
Well, I was,
but I think I'll go back to the motel first.

01:13:51.411 --> 01:13:54.955
No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in about an hour.

01:13:55.039 --> 01:13:57.124
All right, fine. Listen, I...

01:13:57.208 --> 01:13:59.668
You'll be happy to know what I think.

01:13:59.752 --> 01:14:03.755
I think our friend Sam Loomis
didn't know that Marion was here.

01:14:05.466 --> 01:14:08.635
Yeah. All right.
See you in about an hour or less.

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:09.761
All right, bye-bye.

01:15:06.444 --> 01:15:07.652
Bates?

01:17:41.474 --> 01:17:44.059
Sometimes Saturday night
has a lonely sound.

01:17:44.143 --> 01:17:46.228
Ever notice that, Lila?

01:17:47.647 --> 01:17:49.940
Sam, he said an hour or less.

01:17:50.524 --> 01:17:51.816
Yeah.

01:17:53.236 --> 01:17:57.113
- It's been three.
- Well, are we just going to sit here and wait?

01:17:57.198 --> 01:17:58.782
He'll be back.

01:17:59.158 --> 01:18:01.660
Let's sit still and hang on, okay?

01:18:06.999 --> 01:18:10.418
- How far is the old highway?
- You wanna go out there, don't you?

01:18:10.503 --> 01:18:12.003
- Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady...
- Yes.

01:18:12.088 --> 01:18:13.755
- Maybe shake her up.
- Yes!

01:18:13.839 --> 01:18:17.259
- That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
- Patience doesn't run in my family, Sam.

01:18:17.343 --> 01:18:18.969
- I'm going out there.
- Look, Arbogast said...

01:18:19.053 --> 01:18:20.971
An hour, or less.

01:18:25.685 --> 01:18:28.853
- Well, I'm going.
- You'll never find it.

01:18:32.817 --> 01:18:35.110
- Stay here.
- Why can't I go with you?

01:18:35.194 --> 01:18:38.989
I don't know. One of us has to be here,
in case he's on the way.

01:18:39.073 --> 01:18:41.241
What am I supposed to do,
just sit here and wait?

01:18:41.325 --> 01:18:43.159
Yeah. Stay here.

01:19:03.889 --> 01:19:05.181
Arbogast?

01:19:06.559 --> 01:19:07.892
Arbogast!

01:19:11.188 --> 01:19:12.647
Arbogast!

01:19:42.762 --> 01:19:45.180
- He didn't come back here?
- Sam!

01:19:45.264 --> 01:19:48.808
No Arbogast, no Bates.
Only the old lady at home.

01:19:48.893 --> 01:19:51.853
Sick old lady unable to answer the door,
or unwilling.

01:19:51.937 --> 01:19:53.855
Where could he have gone?

01:19:53.939 --> 01:19:56.107
Maybe he got some definite lead.
Maybe he went right on.

01:19:56.233 --> 01:19:58.485
- Without calling me?
- In a hurry.

01:19:58.569 --> 01:20:01.613
Sam, he called when he had nothing.
Nothing but a dissatisfied feeling.

01:20:01.697 --> 01:20:05.408
Don't you think he'd have called
if he had anything at all?

01:20:06.035 --> 01:20:08.036
Yes, I think he would've.

01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:10.246
- Let's go see Al Chambers.
- Who's he?

01:20:10.331 --> 01:20:14.042
- Our deputy sheriff around here.
- All right. Let me get my coat.

01:20:22.093 --> 01:20:23.551
Good evening.

01:20:24.178 --> 01:20:28.098
Well, I don't know where to start,
except at the beginning.

01:20:28.182 --> 01:20:29.307
Yes.

01:20:30.434 --> 01:20:33.311
- This is Lila Crane from Phoenix.
- How do you do?

01:20:33.396 --> 01:20:38.358
She's been here searching for her sister.
There's this private detective helping and...

01:20:38.442 --> 01:20:40.485
Well, we got a call from this detective

01:20:40.569 --> 01:20:42.946
saying that he'd traced her to that motel
out on the old highway.

01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:44.989
That must be the Bates Motel.

01:20:45.074 --> 01:20:47.992
He traced her there and called us to say
he was going to question Mrs Bates.

01:20:48.077 --> 01:20:49.661
Norman took a wife?

01:20:49.745 --> 01:20:53.081
No, I don't think so.
An old woman. His mother.

01:20:53.541 --> 01:20:56.584
Well, anyway, that was early this evening.
We haven't seen or heard from him since.

01:20:56.669 --> 01:21:00.171
Now, your sister's missing how long?

01:21:00.256 --> 01:21:03.425
Well, she left Phoenix a week ago yesterday,
without a trace.

01:21:03.509 --> 01:21:07.011
How'd you and this detective
come to trace her to Fairvale?

01:21:07.096 --> 01:21:09.264
They thought she'd be coming to me.

01:21:09.348 --> 01:21:11.683
- Left Phoenix under her own steam?
- Yes.

01:21:11.767 --> 01:21:14.352
She's not missing so much
as she's run away.

01:21:14.437 --> 01:21:16.688
That's right.
- From what?

01:21:19.692 --> 01:21:22.235
- She stole some money.
A lot?

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:25.613
$40,000.

01:21:26.198 --> 01:21:27.782
And the police haven't been able to...

01:21:27.867 --> 01:21:31.703
Everyone concerned thought if they
could get her to give the money back,

01:21:31.787 --> 01:21:34.247
they could avoid involving her
with the police.

01:21:34.331 --> 01:21:38.251
That explains the private detective.
He traced her to the Bates place.

01:21:38.335 --> 01:21:40.795
What exactly did he say
when he called you?

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:44.674
Well, he said that Marion was there
for one night and then she left.

01:21:44.758 --> 01:21:46.468
With the $40,000?

01:21:47.178 --> 01:21:49.304
Well, he didn't say anything
about the money.

01:21:49.388 --> 01:21:51.806
It isn't important what
he said on the phone, is it?

01:21:51.891 --> 01:21:53.475
He was supposed to come back here
and talk to us

01:21:53.559 --> 01:21:55.643
after he talked to the mother, and he didn't.

01:21:55.728 --> 01:21:57.937
That's what I want you
to do something about.

01:21:58.022 --> 01:21:59.522
Like what?

01:22:00.399 --> 01:22:02.025
I'm sorry if I seem overanxious.

01:22:02.109 --> 01:22:05.820
It's just that I'm sure there's something
wrong out there and I have to know what.

01:22:05.905 --> 01:22:09.365
Well, I think there's something wrong
too, miss, but not the same thing.

01:22:09.450 --> 01:22:12.619
I think what's wrong is
your private detective.

01:22:12.703 --> 01:22:16.664
I think he got himself a hot lead
as to where your sister was going,

01:22:16.749 --> 01:22:18.833
probably from Norman Bates,

01:22:18.918 --> 01:22:23.129
and called you to keep you still
while he took off after her and the money.

01:22:23.214 --> 01:22:27.050
No, no, he said he was dissatisfied
and he was going back there.

01:22:27.134 --> 01:22:29.511
Why don't you call Norman
and let him say just what happened?

01:22:29.595 --> 01:22:30.970
At this hour?

01:22:31.055 --> 01:22:33.264
Well, he was out
when I was there just a while ago.

01:22:33.349 --> 01:22:35.391
If he's back,
he probably isn't even in bed yet.

01:22:35.476 --> 01:22:37.018
He wasn't out when you were there,

01:22:37.102 --> 01:22:40.438
he just wasn't answering the door
in the dead of night, like some people do.

01:22:40.523 --> 01:22:42.774
This fellow lives like a hermit.

01:22:42.858 --> 01:22:45.985
You must remember that bad business
out there about 10 years ago.

01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:47.695
Please. Call.

01:22:53.953 --> 01:22:58.122
Florrie, the Sheriff wants you to
connect him with the Bates Motel.

01:23:04.213 --> 01:23:06.798
Hello, Norman? Sheriff Chambers.

01:23:08.467 --> 01:23:10.218
I've been just fine, thanks.

01:23:10.302 --> 01:23:12.470
Listen, we got worries here.

01:23:13.055 --> 01:23:16.474
Yeah, have you had a fella
stop by there tonight...

01:23:17.643 --> 01:23:19.936
Well, this one wouldn't be
a customer, anyway.

01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:22.981
- He's a private detective, name of...
- Arbogast.

01:23:23.065 --> 01:23:24.649
Arbogast.

01:23:28.195 --> 01:23:30.154
And after he left?

01:23:32.491 --> 01:23:34.033
No, that's okay, Norman.

01:23:36.370 --> 01:23:39.747
This detective was there,
Norman told him about the girl,

01:23:39.832 --> 01:23:42.709
the detective thanked him
and he went away.

01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:46.713
And he didn't come back?
He didn't see the mother?

01:23:46.797 --> 01:23:49.048
Your detective told you
he couldn't come right back

01:23:49.133 --> 01:23:53.011
because he was going to question
Norman Bates' mother, right?

01:23:53.095 --> 01:23:54.220
Yes.

01:23:54.847 --> 01:23:57.640
Norman Bates' mother has
been dead and buried

01:23:57.725 --> 01:24:00.810
in Green Lawn Cemetery
for the past 10 years.

01:24:02.313 --> 01:24:06.024
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

01:24:06.108 --> 01:24:07.775
It ain't only local history, Sam.

01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:11.654
It's the only case of murder and suicide
on Fairvale ledgers.

01:24:11.739 --> 01:24:16.200
Mrs Bates poisoned this guy
she was involved with

01:24:16.285 --> 01:24:18.536
when she found out he was married.

01:24:18.621 --> 01:24:21.706
Then took a helping
of the same stuff herself.

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:24.709
Strychnine. Ugly way to die.

01:24:25.711 --> 01:24:27.962
Norman found them dead together.

01:24:28.047 --> 01:24:29.255
In bed.

01:24:30.841 --> 01:24:33.885
You mean that old woman I saw sitting in
the window out there wasn't Bates' mother?

01:24:33.969 --> 01:24:38.014
Now, wait a minute, Sam.
Are you sure you saw an old woman?

01:24:38.098 --> 01:24:40.558
Yes! In the house behind the motel!

01:24:40.643 --> 01:24:42.935
I called and pounded
but she just ignored me!

01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:45.772
You want to tell me
you saw Norman Bates' mother?

01:24:45.856 --> 01:24:49.067
But it had to be
because Arbogast said so, too!

01:24:49.693 --> 01:24:52.820
And the young man wouldn't let him
see her because she was too ill.

01:24:52.905 --> 01:24:55.782
Well, if the woman up there is Mrs Bates,

01:24:57.117 --> 01:25:00.411
who's that woman buried out
in Green Lawn Cemetery?

01:25:43.789 --> 01:25:47.166
Now, Mother,
I'm gonna bring something up...

01:25:48.836 --> 01:25:50.086
I am sorry, boy,

01:25:50.170 --> 01:25:53.840
but you do manage to look ludicrous
when you give me orders.

01:25:53.924 --> 01:25:55.550
Please, Mother.

01:25:55.634 --> 01:25:58.553
No!
I will not hide in the fruit cellar.

01:25:59.972 --> 01:26:02.098
You think I'm fruity, huh?

01:26:02.182 --> 01:26:04.267
I'm staying right here.

01:26:04.351 --> 01:26:07.186
This is my room
and no one will drag me out of it,

01:26:07.312 --> 01:26:10.398
least of all my big, bold son.

01:26:10.482 --> 01:26:11.566
They'll come now, Mother.

01:26:11.650 --> 01:26:15.570
He came after the girl,
and now someone will come after him.

01:26:15.654 --> 01:26:17.405
Mother, please, it's just for a few days.

01:26:17.489 --> 01:26:19.907
Just for a few days so they won't find you.

01:26:19.992 --> 01:26:21.784
Just for a few days?

01:26:22.286 --> 01:26:25.538
In that dark, dank fruit cellar? No!

01:26:26.165 --> 01:26:29.542
You hid me there once, boy,
and you won't do it again, not ever again!

01:26:29.626 --> 01:26:31.169
Now get out!

01:26:32.713 --> 01:26:36.174
- I told you to get out, boy.
I'll carry you, Mother.

01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:39.469
Norman,
what do you think you're doing?

01:26:39.553 --> 01:26:42.847
Don't you touch me! Don't! Norman!

01:26:48.312 --> 01:26:51.481
Put me down! Put me down!
I can walk on my own.

01:26:59.865 --> 01:27:01.073
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:27:01.158 --> 01:27:02.617
Good morning.

01:27:02.701 --> 01:27:04.994
We thought if you didn't mind,
we'd drive out to that motel with you.

01:27:05.078 --> 01:27:07.371
- He's already been.
- Went out before service.

01:27:07.456 --> 01:27:09.957
- Did you two have breakfast?
- You didn't find anything?

01:27:10.042 --> 01:27:13.002
Nothing. Let's clear the way here.

01:27:13.837 --> 01:27:16.214
Well, what did he say about my sister?

01:27:16.298 --> 01:27:19.467
Just what he told your detective,
she used a fake name.

01:27:19.551 --> 01:27:20.802
Saw the register myself.

01:27:20.886 --> 01:27:23.805
Saw the whole place, as a matter of fact.
That boy's alone there.

01:27:23.889 --> 01:27:26.891
- No mother?
- You must have seen an illusion, Sam.

01:27:26.975 --> 01:27:29.852
I know you're not the seeing-illusions type,

01:27:29.937 --> 01:27:32.438
but no woman was there
and I don't believe in ghosts,

01:27:32.523 --> 01:27:34.357
- so there it is.
- I still feel that there's something...

01:27:34.441 --> 01:27:38.069
Can see you do.
I'm sorry I couldn't make you feel better.

01:27:38.153 --> 01:27:39.862
You want to come around
to my office this afternoon

01:27:39.947 --> 01:27:43.032
and report a missing person and a theft,
that's what you want to do.

01:27:43.116 --> 01:27:45.159
The sooner you drop this
in the lap of the law,

01:27:45.244 --> 01:27:49.080
that's the sooner you stand a chance
of your sister being picked up.

01:27:49.164 --> 01:27:50.748
How about that?

01:27:51.291 --> 01:27:53.709
- I don't know.
- It's Sunday.

01:27:54.461 --> 01:27:56.963
Come on over to the house
and do your reporting around dinnertime.

01:27:57.047 --> 01:27:58.840
It'll make it nicer.

01:27:59.424 --> 01:28:01.759
- You too, Sam.
- Thank you.

01:28:04.137 --> 01:28:07.974
- Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
- No, you're not.

01:28:09.101 --> 01:28:10.852
Well, you want me to drop you
at the hotel or...

01:28:10.936 --> 01:28:11.978
Sam.

01:28:12.062 --> 01:28:15.398
I still won't feel satisfied until I go out there.

01:28:16.608 --> 01:28:18.693
Neither will I. Come on.

01:28:19.945 --> 01:28:24.156
We better decide what we're gonna say
or do when we walk in there.

01:28:24.241 --> 01:28:26.534
We're going to register as man and wife.

01:28:26.618 --> 01:28:29.203
We're going to get shown to a cabin,

01:28:29.705 --> 01:28:33.624
and then we're going to search every
inch of the place, inside and out.

01:28:57.524 --> 01:28:59.317
I wonder where Norman Bates
does his hermiting.

01:28:59.401 --> 01:29:01.903
Someone's at that window.
I just saw the curtain move.

01:29:01.987 --> 01:29:03.279
Come on.

01:29:06.033 --> 01:29:08.534
- Well?
- Just coming up to ring for you.

01:29:08.619 --> 01:29:09.619
Uh-huh.

01:29:09.828 --> 01:29:11.162
Suppose you want a room.

01:29:11.246 --> 01:29:12.997
We were gonna try to make it
straight to San Francisco,

01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:15.207
but we don't like the look of that sky.

01:29:15.292 --> 01:29:18.461
- Looks like a bad day coming, doesn't it?
- Okay.

01:29:25.302 --> 01:29:27.845
- I'll take you to Cabin 10.
- Better sign in first, hadn't we?

01:29:27.930 --> 01:29:29.805
No. That's not necessary.

01:29:29.890 --> 01:29:33.935
My boss is paying for this trip
and, well, it's 90% business.

01:29:34.019 --> 01:29:36.771
He wants practically notarised receipts.

01:29:36.855 --> 01:29:39.482
I'd better sign in and get a receipt.

01:29:57.209 --> 01:29:58.584
Thank you.

01:30:02.422 --> 01:30:04.882
- I'll get your bags.
- Haven't any.

01:30:07.386 --> 01:30:10.554
- I'll show you the room, then.
First time I've ever seen it happen.

01:30:10.639 --> 01:30:12.598
You check in any other place
in this country without bags

01:30:12.683 --> 01:30:14.725
and you have to pay in advance.

01:30:14.810 --> 01:30:16.060
$10.

01:30:23.568 --> 01:30:25.111
That receipt.

01:30:31.076 --> 01:30:32.785
I'll go on ahead.

01:30:38.417 --> 01:30:41.502
All right, there's your receipt.
Now, I'll show you the cabin.

01:30:41.586 --> 01:30:44.296
Don't bother yourself. We'll find it.

01:31:02.899 --> 01:31:04.692
Sam, we have to go into that cabin
and search it,

01:31:04.776 --> 01:31:08.279
no matter what we're afraid of finding
or how much it may hurt.

01:31:08.363 --> 01:31:09.613
I know.

01:31:10.157 --> 01:31:11.907
Do you think if something happened,
it happened there?

01:31:11.992 --> 01:31:13.492
I don't know.

01:31:13.827 --> 01:31:16.328
But if you had a useless
business like this motel,

01:31:16.413 --> 01:31:17.580
what would you need to get out?

01:31:17.664 --> 01:31:19.707
To get a new business somewhere else?

01:31:19.791 --> 01:31:21.167
$40,000?

01:31:23.879 --> 01:31:26.005
How could we prove that...

01:31:26.089 --> 01:31:28.674
Well, if he opens a motel on
the new highway in, say, a year...

01:31:28.759 --> 01:31:31.260
There must be some proof that exists now,

01:31:31.344 --> 01:31:34.889
something that proves he got that money
away from Marion somehow.

01:31:34.973 --> 01:31:39.143
- What makes you sound so certain?
- Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.

01:31:39.644 --> 01:31:43.147
Or he felt sorry for me and he was
beginning to feel the same way about you.

01:31:43.231 --> 01:31:45.941
I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.

01:31:46.026 --> 01:31:47.359
He wouldn't have gone anywhere

01:31:47.444 --> 01:31:50.154
or done anything without telling us,
unless he was stopped.

01:31:50.238 --> 01:31:54.075
And he was stopped.
So he must have found out something.

01:31:56.286 --> 01:31:58.454
We'll start with Cabin One.

01:32:00.832 --> 01:32:03.834
If he sees us, we're just taking the air.

01:32:35.826 --> 01:32:37.034
Bates.

01:33:27.419 --> 01:33:29.712
- No shower curtain.
- Sam!

01:33:29.796 --> 01:33:30.921
- Look!
- What is it?

01:33:31.006 --> 01:33:33.340
It's figuring.
It didn't get washed down. Look.

01:33:33.425 --> 01:33:37.261
Some figure has been added to
or subtracted from 40,000.

01:33:37.345 --> 01:33:38.554
That proves Marion was here.

01:33:38.638 --> 01:33:41.932
- It'd be too wild a coincidence...
- Bates never denied she was here.

01:33:43.059 --> 01:33:45.019
Well, doesn't that prove that he found out
about the money?

01:33:45.103 --> 01:33:46.812
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?

01:33:46.897 --> 01:33:47.897
No.

01:33:47.981 --> 01:33:51.483
But that old woman, whoever she is,
she told Arbogast something.

01:33:51.568 --> 01:33:54.236
I want her to tell us the same thing.

01:33:54.696 --> 01:33:57.364
- You can't go up there.
- Why not?

01:33:57.449 --> 01:33:59.366
- Bates.
- Well, let's find him.

01:33:59.451 --> 01:34:02.161
One of us can keep him occupied
while the other gets to the old woman.

01:34:02.245 --> 01:34:05.289
You'll never be able to hold him still
if he doesn't want to be held.

01:34:05.373 --> 01:34:10.294
- I don't like you going into that house alone.
- I can handle a sick old woman.

01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:13.964
All right, I'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.

01:34:14.507 --> 01:34:16.050
Wait a minute.

01:34:16.635 --> 01:34:19.261
If you get anything out of the mother,

01:34:19.971 --> 01:34:22.139
can you find your way back to town?

01:34:22.224 --> 01:34:23.807
Yes, of course.

01:34:24.559 --> 01:34:27.770
If you do get anything, don't stop to tell me.

01:34:50.835 --> 01:34:53.879
- You looking for me?
- Why, yes, as a matter of fact.

01:34:53.964 --> 01:34:55.589
Wife's taking a nap

01:34:55.674 --> 01:34:59.593
and I never can keep quiet enough for her,
so I just thought I'd look you up and talk.

01:34:59.678 --> 01:35:03.055
- Good. You satisfied with your cabin?
- Oh, it's fine.

01:36:17.756 --> 01:36:20.341
I've been doing all the talking so far,
haven't I?

01:36:20.425 --> 01:36:22.509
I thought it was the people
who were alone most of the time

01:36:22.594 --> 01:36:24.845
who did all the talking
when they got the chance.

01:36:24.929 --> 01:36:27.097
Here you are doing all the listening.

01:36:27.182 --> 01:36:29.516
- You are alone here, aren't you?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:36:29.601 --> 01:36:31.185
Drive me crazy.

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:35.230
I think that would be a rather
extreme reaction, don't you?

01:36:35.315 --> 01:36:36.857
Just an expression.

01:36:36.941 --> 01:36:40.444
What I meant was
I'd do just about anything to get away.

01:36:40.528 --> 01:36:42.279
- Wouldn't you?
- No.

01:36:48.453 --> 01:36:49.828
Mrs Bates?

01:38:06.823 --> 01:38:09.199
I'm not saying
you shouldn't be contented here,

01:38:09.284 --> 01:38:11.160
I'm just doubting that you are.

01:38:11.244 --> 01:38:14.913
I think if you saw a chance to get out
from under, you'd unload this place.

01:38:14.998 --> 01:38:18.333
This place?
This place happens to be my only world.

01:38:19.377 --> 01:38:22.754
I grew up in that house up there.
I had a very happy childhood.

01:38:22.839 --> 01:38:24.465
My mother and I were more than happy.

01:39:26.444 --> 01:39:28.862
You look frightened.
Have I been saying something frightening?

01:39:28.947 --> 01:39:30.447
I don't know what you've been saying.

01:39:30.532 --> 01:39:33.992
I've been talking about your mother,
about your motel.

01:39:34.077 --> 01:39:36.161
- How you gonna do it?
- Do what?

01:39:36.246 --> 01:39:39.164
Buy a new one in a new town
where you won't have to hide your mother.

01:39:39.249 --> 01:39:42.000
Why don't you just get in your car
and drive away from here, okay?

01:39:42.085 --> 01:39:44.044
Where will you get
the money to do that, Bates?

01:39:44.128 --> 01:39:46.046
Or do you already have it socked away?

01:39:46.130 --> 01:39:48.966
- Shut up!
- A lot of it. $40,000.

01:39:52.762 --> 01:39:56.223
I bet your mother knows where
the money is and what you did to get it.

01:39:56.307 --> 01:39:58.308
I think she'll tell us.

01:40:00.144 --> 01:40:03.647
Where's that girl you came here with?
Where is she?

01:41:08.546 --> 01:41:10.130
Mrs Bates...

01:41:30.276 --> 01:41:31.985
I'm Norma Bates!

01:42:03.142 --> 01:42:06.436
If anyone gets any answers
it'll be the psychiatrist.

01:42:06.521 --> 01:42:09.189
Even I couldn't get to Norman
and he knows me.

01:42:09.273 --> 01:42:11.566
- You warm enough, miss?
Yes.

01:42:12.568 --> 01:42:14.444
Did he talk to you?

01:42:15.279 --> 01:42:16.446
No.

01:42:18.282 --> 01:42:23.578
I got the whole story, but not from Norman.
I got it from his mother.

01:42:24.789 --> 01:42:27.290
Norman Bates no longer exists.

01:42:28.251 --> 01:42:30.919
He only half-existed to begin with.

01:42:31.003 --> 01:42:33.922
And now the other half has taken over,

01:42:35.425 --> 01:42:37.509
probably for all time.

01:42:39.637 --> 01:42:41.430
Did he kill my sister?

01:42:41.514 --> 01:42:44.558
Yes. And no.

01:42:45.101 --> 01:42:48.228
Well, now look, if you're trying to lay
some psychiatric groundwork

01:42:48.312 --> 01:42:50.564
for some sort of plea,
this fellow would like to cop...

01:42:50.648 --> 01:42:53.525
A psychiatrist doesn't lay the groundwork.

01:42:53.609 --> 01:42:55.944
He merely tries to explain it.

01:42:56.529 --> 01:42:58.780
- But my sister is...
Yes.

01:43:01.617 --> 01:43:03.702
Yes, I'm sorry.

01:43:04.787 --> 01:43:06.496
The private investigator, too.

01:43:06.581 --> 01:43:11.126
If you drag that swamp somewhere
in the vicinity of the motel, you'll...

01:43:14.672 --> 01:43:17.758
Have you any unsolved missing
persons cases on your books?

01:43:17.842 --> 01:43:20.469
- Yes, two.
- Young girls?

01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:24.514
- Did he confess to...
- Like I said, the mother.

01:43:27.018 --> 01:43:30.771
Now, to understand it the way I understood
it, hearing it from the mother,

01:43:31.355 --> 01:43:34.608
that is, from the mother half
of Norman's mind,

01:43:35.193 --> 01:43:37.611
you have to go back 10 years

01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:41.448
to the time when Norman murdered
his mother and her lover.

01:43:41.532 --> 01:43:46.411
Now, he was already dangerously disturbed,
had been ever since his father died.

01:43:47.455 --> 01:43:51.082
His mother was a clinging,
demanding woman,

01:43:52.585 --> 01:43:57.297
and for years the two of them lived
as if there was no one else in the world.

01:43:57.715 --> 01:43:59.508
Then she met a man,

01:44:00.009 --> 01:44:03.845
and it seemed to Norman
that she threw him over for this man.

01:44:04.597 --> 01:44:08.308
Now, that pushed him over the line
and he killed them both.

01:44:08.893 --> 01:44:12.646
Matricide is probably the most
unbearable crime of all,

01:44:14.106 --> 01:44:17.067
most unbearable to the son who commits it.

01:44:18.069 --> 01:44:22.864
So he had to erase the crime,
at least in his own mind.

01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:27.702
He stole her corpse.

01:44:30.248 --> 01:44:32.582
A weighted coffin was buried.

01:44:33.334 --> 01:44:35.919
He hid the body in the fruit cellar,

01:44:36.379 --> 01:44:39.256
even treated it to keep it
as well as it would keep.

01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:41.550
And that still wasn't enough.

01:44:42.343 --> 01:44:45.971
She was there, but she was a corpse.

01:44:48.516 --> 01:44:51.309
So he began to think and speak for her,

01:44:51.394 --> 01:44:53.937
give her half his life, so to speak.

01:44:54.564 --> 01:44:58.608
At times he could be both personalities,
carry on conversations.

01:44:59.694 --> 01:45:03.196
At other times,
the mother half took over completely.

01:45:03.656 --> 01:45:08.451
He was never all Norman,
but he was often only Mother,

01:45:09.871 --> 01:45:13.248
and because he was
so pathologically jealous of her,

01:45:13.708 --> 01:45:16.167
he assumed that she was as jealous of him.

01:45:16.252 --> 01:45:20.797
Therefore, if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman,

01:45:21.799 --> 01:45:24.551
the mother side of him would go wild.

01:45:27.847 --> 01:45:29.890
When he met your sister,

01:45:31.267 --> 01:45:33.560
he was touched by her, aroused by her.

01:45:33.644 --> 01:45:35.145
He wanted her.

01:45:37.315 --> 01:45:41.443
That set off the jealous mother,
and Mother killed the girl.

01:45:42.987 --> 01:45:46.698
After the murder,
Norman returned as if from a deep sleep,

01:45:47.283 --> 01:45:51.202
and, like a dutiful son,
covered up all traces of the crime

01:45:51.287 --> 01:45:53.914
he was convinced
his mother had committed!

01:45:53.998 --> 01:45:56.333
Why was he dressed like that?

01:45:56.792 --> 01:45:58.668
He's a transvestite.

01:45:59.670 --> 01:46:01.171
Not exactly.

01:46:01.797 --> 01:46:05.216
A man who dresses in women's clothing
in order to achieve a sexual change

01:46:05.301 --> 01:46:07.761
or satisfaction is a transvestite.

01:46:07.845 --> 01:46:12.349
But in Norman's case,
he was simply doing everything possible

01:46:12.433 --> 01:46:15.936
to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive.

01:46:17.229 --> 01:46:19.773
And when reality came too close,

01:46:19.857 --> 01:46:23.401
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion,

01:46:25.738 --> 01:46:28.865
he'd dress up,
even to a cheap wig he bought.

01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:33.078
He'd walk about the house,
sit in her chair, speak in her voice.

01:46:33.162 --> 01:46:35.372
He tried to be his mother.

01:46:37.291 --> 01:46:39.960
And now he is.

01:46:41.879 --> 01:46:45.131
That's what I meant when I said
I got the story from the mother.

01:46:45.216 --> 01:46:48.468
You see, when the mind
houses two personalities,

01:46:49.053 --> 01:46:51.721
there's always a conflict, a battle.

01:46:52.682 --> 01:46:55.475
In Norman's case, the battle is over,

01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:58.728
and the dominant personality has won.

01:46:58.813 --> 01:47:01.606
And the $40,000? Who got that?

01:47:02.775 --> 01:47:06.444
The swamp.
These were crimes of passion, not profit.

01:47:08.698 --> 01:47:12.409
He feels a little chill.
Can I bring him this blanket?

01:47:12.493 --> 01:47:14.452
- Oh, sure.
- All right.

01:47:26.841 --> 01:47:28.216
Thank you.

01:47:35.850 --> 01:47:39.102
It's sad when a mother
has to speak the words

01:47:39.186 --> 01:47:41.187
that condemn her own son,

01:47:41.272 --> 01:47:45.108
but I couldn't allow them to believe
that I would commit murder.

01:47:45.192 --> 01:47:49.029
They'll put him away now,
as I should have years ago.

01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:51.865
He was always bad,

01:47:51.949 --> 01:47:56.995
and in the end he intended to tell them
I killed those girls and that man,

01:47:57.079 --> 01:48:00.790
as if I could do anything
exceptjust sit and stare,

01:48:00.875 --> 01:48:03.293
like one of his stuffed birds.

01:48:04.045 --> 01:48:07.547
They know I can't even move a finger,
and I won't.

01:48:07.631 --> 01:48:13.261
I'll just sit here and be quiet,
just in case they do suspect me.

01:48:16.265 --> 01:48:19.517
They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.

01:48:20.102 --> 01:48:22.937
Let them see what kind of a person I am.

01:48:24.148 --> 01:48:26.566
I'm not even gonna swat that fly.

01:48:26.650 --> 01:48:29.402
I hope they are watching. They'll see.

01:48:29.904 --> 01:48:31.571
They'll see and they'll know,

01:48:31.655 --> 01:48:36.159
and they'll say,
"Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly."
