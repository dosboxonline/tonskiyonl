02:39.660 --> 02:41.036
Na Young.

02:42.204 --> 02:43.581
Why are you crying?

02:48.919 --> 02:51.046
Are you crying because you got
second-best marks in the exams?

03:00.222 --> 03:02.224
Are you mad at me
because I got first place?

03:04.268 --> 03:05.311
Yes.

03:13.986 --> 03:16.989
Hey! I'm always second place to you,

03:18.032 --> 03:19.325
but I never cry.

03:20.117 --> 03:22.369
If I beat you for the first time ever
and you cry,

03:22.494 --> 03:23.996
how do you think that makes me feel?

03:26.582 --> 03:28.042
You psycho.

04:00.324 --> 04:01.533
Don't come in!

04:01.659 --> 04:03.369
Talk from over there.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.079
We decided.

04:07.456 --> 04:08.791
What did you decide?

04:09.166 --> 04:11.585
My name will be Michelle,
and Si Young's will be Mary.

04:12.169 --> 04:14.505
I thought Si Young said
that she wants to be Michelle.

04:15.047 --> 04:17.299
Why would you take your sister's name?

04:17.424 --> 04:19.301
I don't have an English name I like.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.929
Na Young, you still shouldn't take
Si Young's name.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.765
But I hate all the names.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.351
Let's think more about it.

04:30.145 --> 04:31.605
How's Leonore?

04:33.107 --> 04:34.817
For short, Nora.

04:35.985 --> 04:37.027
Nora.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.530
Nora Moon.

04:50.249 --> 04:51.291
Na Young.

04:51.834 --> 04:52.960
Hm?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.462
Who do you like at school nowadays?

05:00.968 --> 05:02.678
What do you want to draw?

05:02.803 --> 05:03.846
Ah, I'm thinking two things.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.889
I want you to draw a tree.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.350
Tree? That's what I'm good at.

05:11.854 --> 05:13.772
A tree doesn't have feelers.

05:14.690 --> 05:15.691
Hae Sung.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.401
Why?

05:18.902 --> 05:19.945
He's manly.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.656
He's manly?

05:23.657 --> 05:26.035
Hm. Yeah. I will probably marry him.

05:27.161 --> 05:28.495
Really?

05:28.620 --> 05:29.955
Does he want to marry you, too?

05:30.080 --> 05:32.624
He likes me, so he will if I tell him to.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.755
Do you want to go on a date with him?

05:53.979 --> 05:55.606
They look so good together.

06:00.944 --> 06:03.280
Hae Sung talks about Na Young a lot.

06:06.325 --> 06:08.994
Na Young told me that she likes him.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.417
We're immigrating soon.

06:18.128 --> 06:20.714
So I wanted to make good memories for her.

06:24.593 --> 06:26.678
You're immigrating?

06:29.348 --> 06:30.474
Yes.

06:35.521 --> 06:37.731
But why are you immigrating?

06:40.776 --> 06:44.154
Na Young's dad is a film director,

06:44.947 --> 06:46.865
and you're an artist.

06:49.118 --> 06:51.453
Why would you leave all that behind?

06:53.664 --> 06:57.292
If you leave something behind,
you gain something, too.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.199
It all looks the same to me.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.160
- Black barks and white...
- What is it?

07:31.994 --> 07:34.872
This is called "blue".

07:37.166 --> 07:39.710
This is called "yellow".

08:05.194 --> 08:06.612
You're really leaving?

08:06.737 --> 08:07.696
Yeah.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.198
You're never coming back?

08:09.323 --> 08:10.365
No.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.783
Why are you leaving?

08:11.909 --> 08:13.076
Because I want to.

08:13.452 --> 08:14.786
Why do you want to leave?

08:16.288 --> 08:18.749
Because Koreans don't win
the Nobel Prize for Literature.

08:40.062 --> 08:41.021
Bye!

08:41.146 --> 08:42.231
Na Young, take care!

08:42.356 --> 08:43.357
Bye.

09:37.452 --> 09:38.453
Hey.

09:42.124 --> 09:43.125
What?

09:47.421 --> 09:48.547
Bye.

10:48.523 --> 10:50.650
Na Young, Si Young!

10:50.776 --> 10:51.902
Let's go.

10:52.903 --> 10:54.446
Hurry up!

13:21.426 --> 13:23.345
Woah, Dong Yun...

13:23.470 --> 13:25.096
He's a lawyer now.

13:25.222 --> 13:26.890
<i>He was a really good kid.</i>

13:27.641 --> 13:30.977
He helped me cover up
when I peed my pants in class.

13:31.102 --> 13:32.896
<i>You'd pee your pants all the time.</i>

13:33.021 --> 13:35.732
A bedwetter lives in New York City.

13:35.857 --> 13:36.858
<i>Yeah.</i>

13:37.359 --> 13:38.860
<i>This bedwetter is killing it.</i>

13:43.031 --> 13:44.658
Who else should we look up?

13:47.118 --> 13:48.870
- What's his name?
-<i>Hmm?</i>

13:48.995 --> 13:50.455
The boy I had a massive crush on?

13:51.706 --> 13:53.375
I went on a date with him.

13:55.126 --> 13:56.169
Hmm...

13:57.837 --> 13:59.422
-<i>Uh... Jung Hae Sung.
-</i> Hae Sung.

14:20.735 --> 14:23.280
Whoa! Mom, this is crazy.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.951
He posted on Dad's movie's
Facebook page asking for me.

14:28.285 --> 14:29.536
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

14:29.953 --> 14:31.162
He posted a few months ago.

14:31.288 --> 14:32.914
"I am looking for Na Young...

14:33.248 --> 14:34.666
I am her childhood friend.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.835
I want to get in touch with her."

14:38.003 --> 14:39.296
<i>Wow. Really?</i>

14:40.589 --> 14:42.048
Let me call you back in a minute.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.592
<i>Okay.</i>

15:28.261 --> 15:30.221
Hae Sung! This is Na Young.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.600
<i>Do you remember me?</i>

15:37.771 --> 15:38.772
Listen...

15:39.105 --> 15:40.357
This is a good thing...

15:41.066 --> 15:42.400
It's a good thing!

15:43.360 --> 15:45.153
Think of it as a blessing that you broke up,

15:45.278 --> 15:46.655
and consider this a new beginning.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.368
There are a lot of women in the world.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.787
Don't worry!

15:56.081 --> 15:57.999
Shit, I must be an idiot...

16:01.795 --> 16:03.171
Why do I miss that bitch?

16:05.507 --> 16:08.635
Of course you miss her, you moron!

16:09.511 --> 16:11.471
If you don't miss her

16:11.596 --> 16:13.640
after being with her for two years,

16:13.765 --> 16:15.308
are you even human?

16:17.394 --> 16:19.562
Hey, no problem. Cry hard.

16:19.688 --> 16:21.856
Hey.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.608
This is a good thing...

16:24.317 --> 16:25.694
a good thing!

16:25.819 --> 16:28.530
She didn't deserve you.
This is a good thing.

16:32.575 --> 16:33.618
Hey!

16:34.244 --> 16:36.329
Do you have a secret girlfriend or something?

16:37.038 --> 16:38.540
What are you talking about?

16:39.249 --> 16:42.836
Who's messaging you at 3:00 a.m.?

16:47.090 --> 16:49.175
I have no idea.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.657
Hae Sung, wake up!

18:22.936 --> 18:24.270
Thank you for this meal.

18:33.238 --> 18:34.614
Did you drink a lot last night?

18:39.744 --> 18:40.870
Kind of.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.590
Why are you in such a good mood?

20:50.166 --> 20:51.376
<i>It's you.</i>

20:55.755 --> 20:57.048
<i>I recognize you.</i>

20:57.715 --> 20:59.050
You, too.

20:59.175 --> 21:02.887
<i>I didn't even know
that you remembered me.</i>

21:03.471 --> 21:06.474
<i>I just looked for you as a joke...</i>

21:07.517 --> 21:09.686
<i>then I saw that you'd been looking for me.</i>

21:09.811 --> 21:11.813
It wasn't a joke for me.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.815
I tried really hard to find you.

21:15.316 --> 21:16.734
It looks like you changed your name?

21:17.860 --> 21:20.071
<i>Yeah. It's Nora now.</i>

21:21.072 --> 21:23.408
That's why I couldn't find you.

21:25.660 --> 21:27.829
Can I just call you Na Young?

21:27.954 --> 21:29.080
<i>Of course.</i>

21:29.455 --> 21:32.875
<i>But nowadays my mom
doesn't even call me Na Young.</i>

21:35.128 --> 21:37.380
<i>It looked like you're in New York.</i>

21:38.089 --> 21:39.966
Yeah, I'm...

21:41.467 --> 21:42.844
a writer here.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.013
A playwright.

21:45.805 --> 21:46.889
<i>Hmm.</i>

21:47.348 --> 21:48.933
<i>Kinda like your father.</i>

21:49.267 --> 21:50.351
Yeah.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.645
<i>Hey, that's cool.</i>

21:56.607 --> 21:57.608
Hello?

21:59.152 --> 22:00.153
<i>Hello?</i>

22:00.695 --> 22:02.113
<i>Can you hear me? I'm here.</i>

22:06.117 --> 22:07.702
Are you home?

22:08.369 --> 22:10.538
<i>Yeah. I have to go to class later.</i>

22:11.289 --> 22:15.877
My mom says your school is a good one.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.587
<i>It's not bad.</i>

22:18.713 --> 22:20.381
I guess you got good grades.

22:21.799 --> 22:23.760
<i>I was ordinary.</i>

22:24.510 --> 22:27.263
We used to compete a lot in school.

22:27.972 --> 22:30.141
You cried because you lost to me.

22:30.266 --> 22:32.852
<i>I lost once.</i>

22:34.228 --> 22:35.938
Do you still cry a lot?

22:37.732 --> 22:38.733
<i>No.</i>

22:39.233 --> 22:40.693
Really?

22:40.818 --> 22:42.862
You used to cry a lot back in those days.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.281
<i>Almost every day.</i>

22:46.657 --> 22:50.119
<i>You would stay with me
whenever I was crying.</i>

22:50.995 --> 22:52.038
Hmm.

22:52.789 --> 22:54.207
Why don't you cry now?

22:54.624 --> 22:56.292
You can't cry in New York City?

22:59.545 --> 23:00.546
<i>Hmm...</i>

23:01.130 --> 23:02.632
<i>When I first immigrated,</i>

23:02.965 --> 23:06.302
<i>I used to cry a lot,</i>

23:06.427 --> 23:11.015
<i>but then I realized that nobody cared.</i>

23:12.642 --> 23:13.643
I see.

23:18.231 --> 23:19.482
<i>What do you study at school?</i>

23:20.274 --> 23:21.943
Uh... Engineering.

23:23.528 --> 23:25.530
<i>I know nothing about that.</i>

23:37.458 --> 23:38.501
I like this.

23:40.211 --> 23:41.254
<i>What?</i>

23:43.381 --> 23:44.423
Just...

23:46.217 --> 23:48.094
<i>talking to you.</i>

23:50.596 --> 23:51.597
<i>Yeah?</i>

23:56.394 --> 23:58.396
<i>I'm a really fun person to talk to.</i>

23:59.272 --> 24:01.065
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

24:01.190 --> 24:03.067
Yeah.

24:04.694 --> 24:05.862
<i>Hmm.</i>

24:09.991 --> 24:11.784
<i>I gotta go to class.</i>

24:12.785 --> 24:14.912
Me, too. I have to eat dinner.

24:16.914 --> 24:18.374
<i>You haven't eaten dinner yet?</i>

24:18.916 --> 24:19.917
Not yet.

24:20.918 --> 24:22.920
<i>Hmm... What time is it there?</i>

24:23.296 --> 24:24.964
Hmm. Midnight.

24:26.048 --> 24:27.550
<i>And you still haven't eaten?</i>

24:28.009 --> 24:29.010
No.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.720
Go and eat right now.

24:32.638 --> 24:33.764
<i>I will.</i>

24:45.026 --> 24:46.068
What?

24:50.448 --> 24:52.450
<i>It doesn't make sense but...</i>

24:54.452 --> 24:56.412
<i>I'm not sure if I can say
something like this.</i>

24:57.872 --> 24:59.832
What do you want to say?

25:07.673 --> 25:09.508
<i>I missed you.</i>

25:20.770 --> 25:21.896
<i>Me too.</i>

25:24.815 --> 25:26.984
- Hmm.
<i>- It doesn't make any sense.</i>

25:32.740 --> 25:34.700
<i>Umm, I really have to go now.</i>

25:34.825 --> 25:36.202
<i>Class is starting soon.</i>

25:36.953 --> 25:39.247
Okay. Bye.

25:39.705 --> 25:40.873
Let's talk again.

25:41.457 --> 25:42.625
<i>We should talk again.</i>

25:42.750 --> 25:44.210
-<i>I'll send you an email.</i>
- Hmm.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.463
-<i>Bye.</i>
- Bye.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.087
<i>Hey.</i>

26:29.046 --> 26:30.047
Hey.

26:30.464 --> 26:32.675
Is it 7:00 in the morning there?

26:34.135 --> 26:36.512
<i>I thought you said you never
wake up before 10:00.</i>

26:39.181 --> 26:41.684
You said this is the only time
that works for you.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.898
Don't you have class today?

26:48.024 --> 26:49.066
<i>Yeah.</i>

26:49.900 --> 26:51.485
<i>So I left home early.</i>

26:53.321 --> 26:55.614
<i>How was rehearsal today?</i>

26:58.034 --> 26:59.744
<i>Your Korean is rusty.</i>

27:02.747 --> 27:03.789
Hey!

27:03.914 --> 27:07.043
I only speak Korean with you
and my mom.

27:07.877 --> 27:10.463
You said you're leaving Korea
to win the Nobel Prize.

27:11.839 --> 27:13.466
You still want that?

27:17.386 --> 27:18.387
<i>Hmm...</i>

27:19.597 --> 27:21.557
<i>Nowadays,</i>

27:22.224 --> 27:23.976
<i>I'm really interested in the Pulitzer.</i>

27:30.566 --> 27:32.651
<i>You're the same as
the 12-year-old kid I remember.</i>

27:33.277 --> 27:34.528
Greedy?

27:35.946 --> 27:38.366
<i>Wants to do everything,
wants to have everything.</i>

27:39.575 --> 27:41.035
Has a terrible temper.

27:43.579 --> 27:44.789
<i>Exactly.</i>

27:47.041 --> 27:48.292
<i>No, no, I'm kidding.</i>

27:50.878 --> 27:53.005
So you're writing there
the whole month?

27:54.632 --> 27:55.633
<i>Yeah.</i>

27:56.384 --> 27:59.095
<i>It's an artist residency.</i>

28:00.346 --> 28:01.430
<i>Can you see?</i>

28:02.723 --> 28:04.350
<i>That's cool.</i>

28:06.143 --> 28:08.062
<i>Where's Montauk?</i>

28:08.604 --> 28:10.773
Hmm... From New York

28:12.066 --> 28:13.734
about four hours east?

28:19.198 --> 28:20.366
Have you seen it?

28:33.170 --> 28:35.214
<i>Would you ever come to New York?</i>

28:37.091 --> 28:39.009
<i>Why would I go to New York?</i>

28:41.178 --> 28:42.721
Why are you going to China?

28:43.514 --> 28:44.932
<i>To learn Mandarin.</i>

28:45.891 --> 28:47.435
You should come to New York

28:47.852 --> 28:49.520
<i>to learn English.</i>

28:50.521 --> 28:52.523
I always wanted to learn Mandarin.

28:53.858 --> 28:55.776
It's also helpful for my work.

29:02.658 --> 29:03.659
That's good.

29:04.452 --> 29:06.120
<i>That's all I know.</i>

29:07.830 --> 29:08.998
Hello?

29:11.125 --> 29:12.334
Hello?

29:15.796 --> 29:16.964
Hae Sung?

29:18.507 --> 29:19.592
Na Young?

29:20.551 --> 29:21.802
Can you hear me?

29:25.097 --> 29:26.182
Hae Sung?

29:26.765 --> 29:27.933
Can you hear me?

29:44.408 --> 29:45.409
We're here.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.497
You can see all of Seoul from up here.

29:52.082 --> 29:53.167
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

29:56.337 --> 29:58.464
<i>Wish I were there.</i>

30:00.341 --> 30:02.218
We should come here together.

30:08.641 --> 30:09.934
I miss you.

30:20.694 --> 30:21.862
Hello?

30:45.094 --> 30:47.012
<i>Would you ever come to Seoul?</i>

30:51.267 --> 30:53.060
Why would I go to Seoul?

30:59.108 --> 31:00.359
Have you done your homework?

31:00.484 --> 31:01.652
I haven't.

31:01.777 --> 31:03.362
You have to do it for graduation.

31:03.487 --> 31:05.656
I got under academic probation
last semester.

31:08.325 --> 31:10.828
- Mm-hmm.
- Class captain's message.

31:12.246 --> 31:13.330
Let me see your homework.

31:13.706 --> 31:15.082
Maybe next time.

31:15.207 --> 31:16.792
- I'm going.
- Oh. Huh?

31:16.917 --> 31:17.918
Bye.

31:18.294 --> 31:19.878
What's your plan for weekend?

31:20.004 --> 31:22.047
Playing games.

31:28.929 --> 31:29.930
<i>Hi.</i>

31:33.183 --> 31:34.268
Hi.

31:37.646 --> 31:38.772
<i>You're not asleep yet?</i>

31:40.316 --> 31:41.400
Not yet.

31:45.779 --> 31:46.864
You okay?

31:48.741 --> 31:49.992
<i>Of course.</i>

31:51.785 --> 31:53.579
What did you want to talk about?

32:00.502 --> 32:04.131
When is it possible for you
to come visit me in New York?

32:08.135 --> 32:09.511
<i>A year and a half or so,</i>

32:10.012 --> 32:12.306
<i>because of my language
exchange program and...</i>

32:12.431 --> 32:14.141
You don't have to explain yourself.

32:18.228 --> 32:21.815
It'll be at least a year before
I can come visit you in Seoul.

32:27.404 --> 32:30.991
<i>I want us to stop talking for a while.</i>

32:36.372 --> 32:37.414
Why?

32:41.794 --> 32:44.838
I immigrated twice to be here in New York.

32:46.256 --> 32:49.218
I want to accomplish something here.

32:50.719 --> 32:53.681
I want to commit to my life here,

32:53.806 --> 32:57.685
but I'm sitting around looking up
flights to Seoul instead.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.606
So you want to stop talking to me?

33:05.234 --> 33:06.860
<i>Just for now.</i>

33:10.531 --> 33:13.659
It took me 12 years to find my friend.

33:17.246 --> 33:18.539
<i>I'll be back before you know it.</i>

33:19.581 --> 33:22.334
<i>We're just taking a brief break.</i>

33:37.474 --> 33:39.309
I think it's a good idea.

33:40.227 --> 33:42.521
Why am I like this?

33:50.195 --> 33:51.488
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

33:54.074 --> 33:55.534
What are you sorry about?

33:55.951 --> 33:57.870
Were we dating or something?

34:17.556 --> 34:18.557
Okay.

34:19.391 --> 34:20.642
Bye.

34:21.435 --> 34:23.061
<i>Talk to you later.</i>

34:25.606 --> 34:26.607
Okay.

34:27.691 --> 34:29.026
Talk then.

38:22.926 --> 38:25.470
Are you okay? We walked around a lot.

38:25.595 --> 38:28.265
My leg's a bit hurt, but I'm okay.

38:28.390 --> 38:32.436
- This leg hurt?
- It's okay.

38:36.106 --> 38:37.733
- Rock, paper, scissor.
- No, thanks.

39:04.926 --> 39:06.011
Hae Sung, you're late.

39:06.136 --> 39:07.387
We're here because of you.

39:07.512 --> 39:08.722
You all packed?

39:09.848 --> 39:10.891
Almost.

39:13.477 --> 39:14.936
So when are you flying out?

39:15.854 --> 39:16.980
This Sunday.

39:17.731 --> 39:19.649
So you'll be there all summer?

39:23.028 --> 39:24.905
Hey, tonight we drink 'til we die.

39:25.655 --> 39:27.783
Why is he like this?

39:28.366 --> 39:29.743
Hell yeah!

39:31.578 --> 39:33.830
If Hae Sung says we drink, we drink.

39:34.456 --> 39:36.249
Another soju, please!

46:58.358 --> 47:00.026
I'm hungry.

47:03.613 --> 47:05.949
What do you want to eat?

47:11.704 --> 47:14.457
Ah... What can I do?

48:17.937 --> 48:19.689
Why are you going to New York?

48:20.440 --> 48:21.441
Vacation.

48:21.858 --> 48:24.277
Rest, enjoy, have fun.

48:26.029 --> 48:28.323
You're not going there
to see that girl, right?

48:28.781 --> 48:29.782
Who?

48:31.326 --> 48:33.620
Why are you pretending not to know
who I'm talking about?

48:33.953 --> 48:35.955
Your first love. I thought she lives there.

48:37.123 --> 48:39.417
You gonna see her now
that you broke up with your girlfriend?

48:39.542 --> 48:42.378
You think I'm nuts? She's married.

48:43.046 --> 48:44.047
Really?

48:47.175 --> 48:48.926
I think it's been about seven years.

48:52.138 --> 48:53.806
She married early.

48:54.891 --> 48:56.726
Ah, you poor bastard.

48:58.686 --> 48:59.729
What?

49:03.900 --> 49:05.568
It's going to rain the whole time you're there.

49:07.487 --> 49:08.946
Look. "Severe thunderstorm."

49:09.947 --> 49:13.076
Hey, don't forget your rain boots and raincoat.

49:14.077 --> 49:16.120
It really does say, "severe thunderstorm".

52:37.905 --> 52:38.948
Hae Sung!

53:12.607 --> 53:14.609
Woah. It's you.

53:55.775 --> 53:57.276
Ah, what can I do?

54:17.254 --> 54:18.589
What should I say?

54:19.632 --> 54:20.883
I don't know.

54:23.260 --> 54:27.264
Was the last time we talked
12 years ago?

54:45.533 --> 54:48.995
Glad the weather is nice today.

54:51.747 --> 54:52.999
You're right.

55:06.262 --> 55:07.346
Should we go?

55:08.055 --> 55:09.056
Yes.

56:35.601 --> 56:38.354
Before I got married,

56:41.524 --> 56:43.692
I went to Korea with my husband.

56:46.278 --> 56:47.279
I know.

56:48.864 --> 56:52.827
I emailed you, but you didn't respond.

56:55.412 --> 56:57.164
I wanted to see you.

57:00.251 --> 57:01.836
I was disappointed.

57:07.925 --> 57:09.135
I'm sorry.

57:12.972 --> 57:15.558
I wanted to meet your girlfriend, too.

57:16.600 --> 57:18.060
How are you two doing?

57:22.815 --> 57:24.608
We're not together right now.

57:27.820 --> 57:29.155
You broke up?

57:30.030 --> 57:31.073
No.

57:33.701 --> 57:35.035
It's not that.

57:36.996 --> 57:39.081
We just need time to think.

57:43.127 --> 57:45.296
We just started talking about getting married.

57:48.465 --> 57:50.634
Do you not want to get married?

57:52.011 --> 57:53.345
I don't know.

57:53.470 --> 57:55.598
If you love her, why don't you know?

57:57.099 --> 57:58.434
It's a little complicated.

57:59.476 --> 58:00.978
What's complicated?

58:01.729 --> 58:03.439
The conditions are not met.

58:04.315 --> 58:06.108
What do you mean?

58:08.402 --> 58:10.321
I'm an only child.

58:10.446 --> 58:12.281
If you're going to marry an only son,

58:12.406 --> 58:15.117
he should make more money and be better.

58:15.576 --> 58:16.827
I'm too ordinary.

58:18.537 --> 58:19.872
You're ordinary?

58:21.165 --> 58:23.500
My job is ordinary,
my income is ordinary.

58:24.418 --> 58:25.961
It's all ordinary.

58:26.754 --> 58:29.590
She should meet someone
more impressive than me.

58:36.096 --> 58:40.017
Is it hard to get married
if you don't make a ton of money?

58:41.602 --> 58:43.437
At first we didn't think so,

58:43.562 --> 58:45.314
but then we started thinking that way.

58:52.613 --> 58:54.114
Want me to take a photo of you?

58:54.907 --> 58:55.908
Okay.

59:09.964 --> 59:11.423
You look good.

59:25.938 --> 59:28.565
Would you and your husband
come out here often on dates?

59:29.316 --> 59:30.317
Hmm.

59:31.068 --> 59:34.863
We lived near here before
we moved to the East Village.

59:35.823 --> 59:37.491
We did all our dating here.

59:39.368 --> 59:40.995
We would fight here, too.

59:41.370 --> 59:44.623
- You two fight?
- Oh yeah, we don't fuck around.

59:45.040 --> 59:46.125
Why do you fight?

59:47.418 --> 59:48.502
Just because.

59:50.170 --> 59:53.841
It's like planting two trees in one pot.

59:55.050 --> 59:57.511
Our roots need to find their place.

01:00:04.018 --> 01:00:06.061
Does your husband
get along with your family?

01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:10.607
Yeah. He plays <i>Hwa-Too</i>
with them all the time.

01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:12.401
He plays <i>Hwa-Too?</i>

01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:13.777
Of course.

01:00:14.737 --> 01:00:15.904
He knows how?

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:17.781
He's good.

01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:20.743
Is his Korean good, too?

01:00:21.243 --> 01:00:22.244
No.

01:00:23.078 --> 01:00:24.455
But he can say a few things.

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:25.956
Oh, yeah?

01:00:29.043 --> 01:00:30.753
His favorite food is <i>Yook-Gae-Jang.</i>

01:00:31.378 --> 01:00:34.173
<i>Yook-Gae-Jung?</i>
He's not fucking around.

01:00:34.798 --> 01:00:36.425
He's not fucking around.

01:00:40.304 --> 01:00:42.222
Do you and your girlfriend...

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.767
fight?

01:00:44.892 --> 01:00:46.101
No.

01:00:47.936 --> 01:00:49.813
She's not really my girlfriend right now.

01:00:52.274 --> 01:00:54.360
You should get married well.

01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:57.071
You're worrying about me?

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:05.537
Getting married is hard
for idealistic people like you.

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:10.209
Hey, I'm not so old that you should worry.

01:01:45.661 --> 01:01:46.745
Hae Sung.

01:01:47.538 --> 01:01:48.664
Hmm?

01:01:53.335 --> 01:01:55.379
Why did you look for me?

01:01:58.257 --> 01:02:00.926
- 12 years ago?
- Hmm.

01:02:05.514 --> 01:02:07.099
Do you really want to know?

01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:16.400
I just wanted to see you one more time.

01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:18.652
I don't know.

01:02:21.697 --> 01:02:26.118
Because you just left so suddenly...

01:02:26.702 --> 01:02:28.245
I was a little pissed off.

01:02:30.122 --> 01:02:31.206
Sorry.

01:02:31.832 --> 01:02:33.250
What are you sorry about?

01:02:34.376 --> 01:02:37.129
You're right.
There's nothing to be sorry about.

01:02:40.007 --> 01:02:43.343
You disappeared from my life,
and I just bam...

01:02:43.719 --> 01:02:45.637
found you again.

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:49.183
Why would you do that?

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:54.104
I don't know.

01:02:56.857 --> 01:02:57.858
Just because...

01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:03.739
You kept entering my mind
when I was in the military.

01:03:07.409 --> 01:03:08.744
I see.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:24.510
We were babies then.

01:03:25.969 --> 01:03:27.137
Right.

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:31.308
And when we met 12 years ago,

01:03:31.433 --> 01:03:33.352
we were babies then, too.

01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:39.399
We're not babies anymore.

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:42.747
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:15:43.414 --> 01:15:45.166
Did you get home safe last night?

01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:46.417
Yeah.

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:48.002
Sorry I'm late.

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:50.797
Did you eat something?

01:15:51.422 --> 01:15:52.423
No.

01:15:59.847 --> 01:16:00.848
Eat this.

01:16:00.974 --> 01:16:02.725
Is it for me?

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:17.198
I wanted to ask you yesterday...

01:16:18.783 --> 01:16:20.785
What prize do you want to win nowadays?

01:16:21.119 --> 01:16:22.120
Hmm?

01:16:23.288 --> 01:16:26.833
When you were little you wanted
to win the Nobel Prize,

01:16:26.958 --> 01:16:29.544
and 12 years ago you wanted
to win the Pulitzer.

01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:32.088
What do you want to win now?

01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:37.719
I haven't thought of things like that recently.

01:16:37.844 --> 01:16:38.928
Really?

01:16:39.053 --> 01:16:40.638
Then think about it for a moment.

01:16:41.723 --> 01:16:43.349
There must be an award you want.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.484
A Tony.

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:56.654
You really are exactly
the same as I remember you.

01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:58.948
Still psycho?

01:17:00.575 --> 01:17:02.201
Still psycho.

01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:51.292
A little bit to your left.

01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:53.711
One, two... three!

01:17:54.545 --> 01:17:55.546
One more.

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.387
Why are you taking it so close up?

01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:04.555
Fine. Go back a little bit.

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:26.661
She's turned against us.

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:00.820
Hold on.

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.118
You look young.

01:19:08.578 --> 01:19:09.996
Because of my green card,

01:19:10.121 --> 01:19:12.457
we got married
a little earlier than planned.

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:21.424
He knows I'm coming over?

01:19:21.841 --> 01:19:22.842
Of course.

01:19:31.809 --> 01:19:33.144
He knows who I am?

01:19:33.895 --> 01:19:34.979
Of course!

01:19:36.147 --> 01:19:37.648
He wants to meet you.

01:20:04.926 --> 01:20:05.927
Come in.

01:20:35.414 --> 01:20:36.749
Hello.

01:20:38.501 --> 01:20:40.628
Nice to meet you.

01:20:50.763 --> 01:20:52.181
His Korean is good.

01:20:52.306 --> 01:20:53.474
No.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.733
Are you hungry?

01:21:07.029 --> 01:21:08.281
Hungry?

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:13.202
What would you like to eat?

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:54.994
Hey, you should take your husband.

01:22:21.687 --> 01:22:23.439
Oh. Military service?

01:22:34.408 --> 01:22:36.369
How was it? Did you like it?

01:22:46.212 --> 01:22:47.713
Same? How?

01:22:54.053 --> 01:22:56.806
There's overtime pay, stuff like that here, right?

01:22:58.557 --> 01:23:00.142
In Korea, you work overtime all the time,

01:23:00.267 --> 01:23:01.811
but there's no overtime pay.

01:23:05.272 --> 01:23:06.649
- Really?
- Mm.

01:23:07.191 --> 01:23:09.777
You have to do
all of your boss's work first,

01:23:10.444 --> 01:23:12.822
then you do your own work,

01:23:13.155 --> 01:23:15.533
and then you can go home.

01:23:16.492 --> 01:23:17.910
Late at night?

01:23:18.035 --> 01:23:19.412
That's so hard.

01:23:31.465 --> 01:23:34.218
Physically, or mentally?

01:23:50.818 --> 01:23:52.778
You're strong mentally?

01:23:52.903 --> 01:23:54.405
Yes, right.

01:24:09.837 --> 01:24:11.172
It was good that you immigrated.

01:24:11.505 --> 01:24:14.216
Mm. I agree.

01:24:14.341 --> 01:24:16.260
Korea is too small of a country for you.

01:24:17.303 --> 01:24:20.014
It's not enough to satisfy your ambition.

01:24:23.642 --> 01:24:25.561
I'm glad to have seen you.

01:24:26.896 --> 01:24:27.897
Yeah.

01:24:29.273 --> 01:24:32.276
And thank you for introducing me
to your husband.

01:24:33.194 --> 01:24:35.571
I can tell he really loves you.

01:24:38.199 --> 01:24:39.200
Hmm.

01:24:41.994 --> 01:24:44.955
I didn't know that liking
your husband would hurt this much.

01:24:54.799 --> 01:24:55.841
Yeah?

01:24:58.177 --> 01:24:59.178
Hmm.

01:25:03.224 --> 01:25:06.644
When we stopped talking,

01:25:06.769 --> 01:25:09.104
I really missed you.

01:25:11.315 --> 01:25:12.691
Did you miss me?

01:25:12.817 --> 01:25:13.818
Of course.

01:25:15.194 --> 01:25:16.362
But you met your husband then.

01:25:16.487 --> 01:25:18.197
You got a girlfriend then, too.

01:25:23.244 --> 01:25:24.286
Sorry.

01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:30.751
It's okay.

01:25:31.502 --> 01:25:32.962
Seeing you again

01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:37.508
and being here makes me have
a lot of weird thoughts.

01:25:39.093 --> 01:25:40.177
What kind of thoughts?

01:25:42.179 --> 01:25:47.393
What if I'd come
to New York 12 years ago?

01:25:48.686 --> 01:25:51.063
What if you had never left Seoul?

01:25:52.565 --> 01:25:54.525
If you hadn't just left like that,

01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:56.193
and we just grew up together,

01:25:58.237 --> 01:25:59.864
would I still have looked for you?

01:26:01.115 --> 01:26:05.160
Would we have dated? Broken up?

01:26:05.578 --> 01:26:06.954
Gotten married?

01:26:09.707 --> 01:26:11.542
Would we have had kids together?

01:26:11.667 --> 01:26:13.002
Thoughts like that.

01:26:20.718 --> 01:26:23.929
But the truth I learned here is,

01:26:26.473 --> 01:26:28.893
you had to leave because you're you.

01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:33.939
And the reason I liked you
is because you're you.

01:26:37.026 --> 01:26:41.447
And who you are is someone who leaves.

01:26:45.284 --> 01:26:47.244
The Na Young you remember

01:26:47.369 --> 01:26:49.121
doesn't exist here.

01:26:50.122 --> 01:26:51.582
I know.

01:26:55.794 --> 01:26:56.962
But...

01:26:57.796 --> 01:26:59.590
that little girl did exist.

01:27:01.967 --> 01:27:04.637
She's not sitting here in front of you,

01:27:04.762 --> 01:27:06.805
but it doesn't mean she's not real.

01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:10.684
20 years ago,

01:27:11.852 --> 01:27:14.897
I left her behind with you.

01:27:17.983 --> 01:27:18.984
I know.

01:27:21.111 --> 01:27:22.738
And even though I was only 12,

01:27:22.863 --> 01:27:24.949
I loved her.

01:27:31.205 --> 01:27:32.706
You psycho.

01:27:40.673 --> 01:27:45.469
I think there was something
in our past lives.

01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:50.724
Otherwise, why would we be here
together right now?

01:27:51.976 --> 01:27:55.229
But in this life,

01:27:55.354 --> 01:27:57.231
we don't have the <i>In-Yun</i> to be

01:27:57.356 --> 01:27:59.108
that kind of person to each other.

01:28:00.234 --> 01:28:02.069
Because now, finally,

01:28:03.153 --> 01:28:04.738
we're in the same city

01:28:05.781 --> 01:28:08.450
for the first time in 20 years...

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:16.041
We're sitting here with your husband.

01:28:23.215 --> 01:28:26.677
In this life, you and Arthur
are that kind of <i>In-Yun</i> to each other.

01:28:28.012 --> 01:28:30.347
You two have the 8,000 layers of <i>In-Yun.</i>

01:28:32.349 --> 01:28:33.976
To Arthur,

01:28:34.977 --> 01:28:37.187
you're someone who stays.

01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:51.869
Who do you think we were to each other
in our past lives?

01:28:51.994 --> 01:28:53.120
I don't know.

01:28:54.496 --> 01:28:56.665
Maybe... an impossible affair?

01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:58.834
Between the queen
and the king's henchman?

01:29:00.377 --> 01:29:03.422
Or maybe we were forced
to live together

01:29:03.547 --> 01:29:05.299
in a political marriage,

01:29:05.424 --> 01:29:07.301
and we were awful to each other.

01:29:07.426 --> 01:29:08.719
Cheat on each other a bunch.

01:29:08.844 --> 01:29:10.387
Say hurtful things to each other.

01:29:12.264 --> 01:29:15.100
Or maybe we were just sitting
next to each other on the same train.

01:29:15.225 --> 01:29:16.435
Why?

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.562
Just because that's what our tickets said.

01:29:21.065 --> 01:29:22.066
Maybe,

01:29:22.816 --> 01:29:26.236
we were just a bird

01:29:26.361 --> 01:29:29.490
and the branch it sat on one morning.

01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:44.911
Will it be here soon?

01:33:46.955 --> 01:33:48.165
Two minutes.

01:35:22.759 --> 01:35:23.760
Hey!

01:35:30.684 --> 01:35:31.852
Na Young.

01:35:33.478 --> 01:35:34.563
Hmm?

01:35:45.365 --> 01:35:47.409
What if this is a past life as well,

01:35:48.952 --> 01:35:50.912
and we are already

01:35:51.496 --> 01:35:54.541
something else to each other
in our next life?

01:36:01.089 --> 01:36:02.841
Who do you think we are then?

01:36:05.343 --> 01:36:06.928
I don't know.

01:36:12.726 --> 01:36:13.727
Me neither.

01:36:23.236 --> 01:36:24.738
See you then.
