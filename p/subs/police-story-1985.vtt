01:47.147 --> 01:51.693
This is Tao Chu, in his late 40s.

01:51.860 --> 01:58.199
Night club owner, trader and realtor.

01:58.366 --> 02:01.911
All his businesses are losing money.

02:02.412 --> 02:04.372
How are things up there?

02:05.540 --> 02:08.501
This is Song Ming, his bodyguard.

02:08.668 --> 02:13.757
These are all his hit men.

02:13.965 --> 02:16.009
Be careful.
See you up there.

02:17.218 --> 02:19.929
Wait for me up there.

02:27.812 --> 02:30.398
This is Danny Chu, his nephew.

02:30.565 --> 02:32.192
Always has an army
hanging around him.

02:32.359 --> 02:34.944
This is You-Han Ko, Chu's brain.

02:36.988 --> 02:39.157
This is Salina Fong.

02:39.324 --> 02:42.285
Only been hanging around
Chu recently.

02:42.452 --> 02:44.537
Does she know everything
about Chu yet?

02:44.704 --> 02:47.499
Well, it's difficult to tell.

02:52.128 --> 02:56.424
Our objective is
to take all of them in.

02:56.591 --> 03:00.512
Our code is Operation Boar Hunt.

03:00.679 --> 03:03.014
- Understand?
- Yes.

03:03.181 --> 03:07.185
Read what's inside your envelope.
Each one has his own instructions.

03:17.696 --> 03:19.114
Remember it by heart
and destroy the written orders.

03:19.614 --> 03:22.242
Each man does his own job.

03:24.411 --> 03:26.871
Come on.

03:45.557 --> 03:49.810
Attention,
this is T.O.C. headquarters.

03:49.811 --> 03:50.812
Operation begins at once.

04:48.411 --> 04:49.788
I'll get you some tea.

04:53.249 --> 04:55.794
- Two cups of tea, please.
- Okay.

05:08.473 --> 05:09.557
I'll be back later.

05:12.769 --> 05:14.103
There is a guy who looks suspicious.

05:15.897 --> 05:17.732
Two cups of tea, please.

05:18.024 --> 05:19.984
Signal them below.
I'm going down.

05:27.575 --> 05:29.828
- Dai-Hao Gahn.
- One for me?

05:29.994 --> 05:31.830
- We've been discovered.
- What?

05:32.205 --> 05:34.749
Follow the one in the red shirt.

05:47.637 --> 05:48.680
- What's up?
- This is Salina.

05:48.847 --> 05:50.974
There's a suspicious guy down here.

05:51.182 --> 05:52.058
- What's up with you?
- Police!

05:52.809 --> 05:54.394
Police! Help!

05:54.561 --> 05:55.770
Police?

06:09.242 --> 06:10.910
Freeze, C.I.D.

06:12.829 --> 06:15.415
- What's up? I heard shooting.
- They opened fire.

06:15.582 --> 06:17.750
- What should we do?
- Let's scatter the crowd first.

06:17.917 --> 06:19.544
Police!
Please evacuate immediately!

06:22.964 --> 06:25.300
Special Force, what happened?
Over!

06:26.384 --> 06:27.635
Police!
Please evacuate immediately!

06:28.219 --> 06:29.888
Move!

06:32.932 --> 06:33.558
Over there.

06:33.725 --> 06:38.271
Close in, mind those residents.
Get the kids inside.

06:38.855 --> 06:41.274
Hurry, run, kid.

06:41.441 --> 06:42.609
Hurry, run.

06:49.657 --> 06:50.909
This way.

07:04.255 --> 07:06.006
Go help them.

07:06.007 --> 07:07.050
We have orders to stay.

07:07.258 --> 07:10.470
You must improvise
in this situation. Go.

07:20.897 --> 07:23.441
- Let me go.
- Pulling just hurts.

07:23.858 --> 07:24.609
Let me go.

07:38.039 --> 07:39.624
I've got this covered.
You can leave.

07:39.791 --> 07:40.792
Quick, protect the boss.

07:40.959 --> 07:42.043
Go on.

08:00.186 --> 08:02.522
There's a female suspect up there,
take her back.

08:07.986 --> 08:08.987
It's me.

08:13.658 --> 08:16.202
- What happened?
- Don't ask.

08:20.623 --> 08:23.001
Calm down.

08:35.888 --> 08:40.058
- Help me.
- Tom, cover me.

09:04.625 --> 09:10.173
Tom, what are you doing?

09:10.757 --> 09:12.425
Be cool.

09:21.267 --> 09:23.603
Help me.

09:23.978 --> 09:26.230
Take care of him there.

09:41.037 --> 09:42.580
They've got a lot of fire power!

09:44.540 --> 09:47.210
Watch out for the villagers.
That's our order.

09:47.418 --> 09:49.504
Have they told that
to the crooks, too?

09:50.671 --> 09:51.798
Some cop you are!

09:51.964 --> 09:53.841
Hurry, come here!

09:57.303 --> 09:59.931
Watch out, Ka-Kui.

10:20.493 --> 10:22.411
Boss, over there.

10:26.165 --> 10:27.708
Get in.

10:29.460 --> 10:30.837
Out of my Way!

10:31.003 --> 10:34.006
Drive away!
Get back, get back!

10:39.178 --> 10:40.304
Get back!

10:41.139 --> 10:42.723
- What happened?
- It's blocked up there! Move back!

10:42.890 --> 10:44.142
- Move back!
- Move back!

10:45.143 --> 10:49.230
You can't go this way!
It's blocked down there! Go up!

10:49.564 --> 10:51.440
We're stuck, boss!
Now what?

10:51.607 --> 10:53.943
- We fight our way down!
- Let's go!

12:06.933 --> 12:08.100
Boss, hurry!

12:21.280 --> 12:22.573
Hurry!

12:23.783 --> 12:25.243
Let's go this way.

12:37.255 --> 12:38.297
Freeze!

12:40.883 --> 12:43.719
Watch out for the pedestrians!

12:44.011 --> 12:46.222
Where have you been?
This is your station!

12:46.389 --> 12:47.306
I went up to help.

12:47.307 --> 12:49.725
Who gave you the orders?
They're gone now.

12:50.184 --> 12:51.435
What do you mean by that?

13:01.237 --> 13:02.321
Drive now!

13:05.324 --> 13:06.701
Let me borrow it.

13:06.867 --> 13:10.037
Tell them to get down. Out of the way.
Don't let them see my face.

13:10.204 --> 13:11.747
Tell the driver to step on it.

13:19.005 --> 13:20.798
Get down!

14:04.925 --> 14:05.926
Turn here, turn!

14:13.601 --> 14:14.310
Go at it!

14:14.769 --> 14:15.853
- Really?
- Go at it!

14:28.157 --> 14:29.200
Easy, boss, we'll make it.

14:29.367 --> 14:30.451
Look!

14:38.793 --> 14:41.379
Go up there and take care of him.

14:41.837 --> 14:42.963
Tell the driver to step on it.

14:53.766 --> 14:55.559
Hit him.

14:57.186 --> 14:58.521
Hurry down!

15:12.827 --> 15:14.620
Turn quickly down the hill!

15:49.655 --> 15:51.824
Are you nuts?
Right in the middle of the road.

15:51.991 --> 15:53.367
Move over. I'm a cop.

15:56.495 --> 15:58.747
He is right in front of us.

15:59.790 --> 16:00.458
Run him over.

16:00.791 --> 16:02.209
Okay.
Step on it, run him over.

16:09.049 --> 16:09.675
Don't be scared.

16:39.914 --> 16:41.081
Don't move.

16:43.626 --> 16:46.337
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

16:46.504 --> 16:51.258
Let me go, and this is yours.

16:56.138 --> 16:58.807
Once-in-a-lifetime chance!

16:59.308 --> 17:02.520
No one will know.

17:04.688 --> 17:06.106
Smart guy.

17:06.272 --> 17:07.358
Don't move.

17:16.742 --> 17:19.411
Good show, isn't it?

17:19.578 --> 17:22.873
Be modest
when he praises you later.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.124
Don't let it get to you.

17:24.708 --> 17:28.253
You better tell Ka-Kui.

17:29.255 --> 17:33.008
I didn't do it by myself.
I acted according to the orders.

17:33.425 --> 17:34.927
That's fine.

17:35.094 --> 17:38.430
Don't forget this line later
when he comes.

17:38.597 --> 17:40.641
He must be happy to hear that.

17:45.271 --> 17:47.690
Operation Boar Hunt
is a carefully planned job.

17:47.898 --> 17:50.234
Didn't you cover every angle?

17:50.568 --> 17:52.987
The prime suspect almost got away.

17:53.779 --> 17:56.782
Didn't Chou give you clear orders?

17:57.366 --> 18:00.160
Yes, he said we were
under good leadership.

18:00.327 --> 18:01.412
What?

18:02.580 --> 18:06.375
The job was carefully planned.
But our execution had a few flaws.

18:06.542 --> 18:08.168
Why were there flaws?

18:08.586 --> 18:10.796
Must have been
before we got to the store.

18:10.963 --> 18:14.133
Ka-Kui couldn't handle the secretary,
and she created a mess.

18:14.300 --> 18:17.720
Chu almost escaped
because you weren't in the position.

18:17.928 --> 18:18.887
What do you mean by that?

18:19.638 --> 18:21.557
It's no time to point your fingers.

18:23.017 --> 18:24.268
- What is it?
<i>- The P.R. girl is here.</i>

18:24.435 --> 18:25.603
Send her in.

18:29.607 --> 18:31.483
The press is here, Sir.

18:31.650 --> 18:33.235
What press?
Tell them, "No comment."

18:33.402 --> 18:35.653
Look, I asked them to come here.

18:35.654 --> 18:37.948
- Tell them to wait.
- Yes, Sir.

18:38.115 --> 18:42.494
- Ka-Kui, you'll be our speaker.
- Me? No, no.

18:42.661 --> 18:45.705
The speech has been written.
Just read it.

18:45.706 --> 18:49.918
Learn your lines and don't fluff them.
You can go now.

18:50.085 --> 18:51.587
Yes, Sir.

18:56.216 --> 19:00.429
The Commissioner's pleased
that Ka-Kui captured Chu alone.

19:00.596 --> 19:02.514
A promising young man.

19:02.681 --> 19:05.851
After the press meeting,
get him on the recruitment poster.

19:06.060 --> 19:09.188
Get him on TV shows or radio.

19:09.438 --> 19:10.772
An example of the force.

19:10.773 --> 19:13.400
The Commissioner sees him
as a model policeman.

19:13.567 --> 19:15.986
He can handle that easily.

19:16.153 --> 19:18.696
What are the charges
on Chu's secretary?

19:18.697 --> 19:21.659
Drug-trafficking, resisting arrest.

19:22.785 --> 19:25.954
- Drop all the charges.
- Drop all the charges?

19:30.000 --> 19:33.337
You played a big part,
Detective Chan.

19:33.545 --> 19:37.216
Our superiors' leadership
accounts for the success.

19:38.258 --> 19:39.468
Good job.

19:39.677 --> 19:40.678
Will you be promoted?

19:42.012 --> 19:45.307
We don't fight crime for promotion.

19:45.474 --> 19:47.685
Our superiors
take care of promotion matters.

19:48.310 --> 19:50.354
Chu tried to bribe you
with millions, right?

19:50.688 --> 19:54.191
With that money,
he could buy the whole force.

19:54.358 --> 19:56.694
Just kidding.
Don't put it down.

19:56.860 --> 19:58.696
Please sit closer.

19:59.905 --> 20:01.240
What are you doing?

20:01.407 --> 20:04.326
- Just saying hi.
- Move over.

20:05.411 --> 20:06.995
It's our turn.

20:10.290 --> 20:12.376
- Go ahead with it, understand?
- Yes.

20:12.543 --> 20:13.794
Let's start.

20:25.514 --> 20:26.849
Straighten up.

20:27.099 --> 20:28.851
Open your eyes.

20:29.059 --> 20:32.354
Open your mouth.
Wider! Wider!

20:35.065 --> 20:38.026
Forget it, just be yourself.
Be natural.

20:39.236 --> 20:40.654
Ready.

20:42.531 --> 20:44.199
The handcuffs have to be
in the middle of the picture.

20:44.366 --> 20:46.034
And be happy-

21:01.216 --> 21:05.179
- Your way wouldn't work.
- Why not?

21:05.345 --> 21:09.683
She's Chu's secretary.
She won't cooperate.

21:10.142 --> 21:12.144
Chu has been
under arrest already.

21:12.311 --> 21:15.689
If Chu knows she'll be our witness,
what would he do?

21:17.524 --> 21:23.322
He would stop her
appearing in court.

21:23.489 --> 21:26.867
Our man who covers her
would be in danger.

21:28.827 --> 21:33.123
Don't be a cop
if you want to live to 100.

21:33.290 --> 21:36.877
You want this line
on the recruitment poster?

21:37.044 --> 21:39.213
We don't have enough
to prosecute Chu.

21:39.379 --> 21:42.299
We must push him into a corner.

21:42.466 --> 21:44.301
Let him make a mistake.

21:44.468 --> 21:46.011
I suggest a man
to protect our lady witness.

21:46.220 --> 21:48.972
I have someone in mind already.

21:49.139 --> 21:51.767
Are we thinking of the same man?

21:57.564 --> 21:58.899
Good luck to him.

22:00.442 --> 22:02.945
Why would they release you
but not the others?

22:03.779 --> 22:05.030
Lucky you.

22:09.159 --> 22:11.870
- They are to see the Superintendent.
- Please wait for a moment.

22:12.037 --> 22:13.913
- Please wait for a moment.
- Okay.

22:13.914 --> 22:16.208
You can go
after seeing the Superintendent.

22:20.921 --> 22:23.382
- You can go in now.
- Thanks.

22:29.596 --> 22:31.849
Please have a sit.

22:34.101 --> 22:35.811
You can go now, Miss Fong.

22:36.937 --> 22:42.818
Wait, there's a subpoena on you
to appear in court.

22:45.195 --> 22:47.322
- What is the charge?
- There are no charges.

22:47.489 --> 22:50.284
You'll be our witness.

22:50.450 --> 22:54.079
Sorry, my client
isn't prepared to do so.

22:54.288 --> 22:59.877
We are not asking her permission.
She is required by law to do it.

23:03.463 --> 23:04.882
- Officer Chan.
- Yes, Sir.

23:05.048 --> 23:08.343
You're to protect Miss Fong
from now on, 24 hours a day

23:08.510 --> 23:09.261
until she appears in court.

23:09.428 --> 23:10.888
Me? Protecting her?

23:11.054 --> 23:13.515
- You don't like it.
- Yes, I do.

23:13.682 --> 23:17.895
- I don't need his protection.
- You can't refuse.

23:20.898 --> 23:21.899
- Officer Chan.
- Yes, Sir.

23:22.065 --> 23:25.027
I'm sure you know what's involved.

23:25.235 --> 23:28.946
Someone may try to harm her.

23:28.947 --> 23:30.741
She will be a target.
Threats, assaults...

23:30.908 --> 23:35.078
it could be outside or at home.
You must protect her day and night.

23:35.287 --> 23:37.122
But not at the expense
of bothering her

23:37.289 --> 23:38.916
or violating her civil rights.

23:39.082 --> 23:42.336
- Understand?
- Yes, but can someone else go?

23:42.502 --> 23:47.674
You'll get a bonus for the duty.
$32.80 per day.

23:47.841 --> 23:50.928
It's an old tradition,
unchanged for years.

23:51.094 --> 23:53.388
Bring your own money.
That's all.

23:53.555 --> 23:57.142
Can we talk to you alone?

23:57.351 --> 24:00.978
I refuse to have my client
interrogated alone.

24:00.979 --> 24:05.692
This is not an interrogation.
Just a few tips for her benefit.

24:10.614 --> 24:13.075
You can refuse them.

24:13.283 --> 24:14.952
Let's hear what they have to say.

24:16.370 --> 24:19.581
Mr. Cheung, if you please.

24:21.124 --> 24:24.085
Remember, any questions
concerning this case

24:24.086 --> 24:26.588
or anything else, don't answer.

24:32.052 --> 24:33.720
- Why are you still here?
- I have to go out too?

24:33.887 --> 24:35.389
You've got high rank?

25:18.348 --> 25:19.891
You said you had things to say to me.

25:21.810 --> 25:25.313
Nothing else now.
You can go.

25:28.692 --> 25:30.610
See you in court.

25:31.445 --> 25:35.449
They're...

25:35.991 --> 25:37.325
Ka-Kui.

25:38.285 --> 25:39.745
- Tape it if possible.
- Okay.

25:40.120 --> 25:43.707
- What did they say to you?
- They didn't say anything.

25:43.874 --> 25:46.167
I'm your lawyer.
You can trust me.

25:46.168 --> 25:50.088
They didn't say anything, really.

25:52.758 --> 25:56.011
- Why just her alone?
- Here they are.

25:57.679 --> 25:59.723
How about the boss?

25:59.890 --> 26:02.099
Can't bail him and the others out.

26:02.100 --> 26:03.351
What about Salina?

26:04.019 --> 26:07.147
- She's their witness now.
- Testifying for them?

26:07.314 --> 26:08.356
They forced me.

26:09.107 --> 26:10.358
You couldn't say no?

26:10.525 --> 26:13.445
Stop disturbing her.

26:14.112 --> 26:16.823
- Who are you?
- I'm a cop.

26:16.990 --> 26:19.743
She is given police protection.

26:19.910 --> 26:22.954
Any more crap from you,
I will arrest you.

26:23.121 --> 26:24.623
Salina.

26:24.790 --> 26:26.666
You can say "so long" or "good-bye".

26:26.833 --> 26:29.961
One more word,
and you'll be under arrest.

26:33.131 --> 26:37.218
- I'll take you home.
- It's my responsibility.

26:37.219 --> 26:39.012
I won't say anything.

26:42.724 --> 26:46.269
- What now, Mr. Cheung?
- I'll see your boss later.

26:46.478 --> 26:47.979
Okay, let's go.

26:49.940 --> 26:53.610
It's dangerous to roam around.
Go home.

26:53.777 --> 26:55.487
It's none of your business.

26:57.114 --> 27:00.450
It's for your safety.

27:00.617 --> 27:03.328
I don't need you, parasite!

27:05.205 --> 27:07.249
You know what happened
to four of our witnesses

27:07.457 --> 27:08.959
who said the same thing?

27:09.126 --> 27:11.628
What? They got shot?

27:11.795 --> 27:15.340
Don't scare me.
Tell me what happened to them.

27:15.549 --> 27:18.218
Your guess is right.
They're all fine.

27:18.385 --> 27:19.678
You have the right to say so.

27:19.845 --> 27:21.471
Jerk!

27:24.015 --> 27:26.225
All evidence is against your men.

27:26.226 --> 27:29.521
It's a tough case.
Maybe I can get you off.

27:29.688 --> 27:32.231
I'm depending on you.

27:32.232 --> 27:36.278
I'll do my best to get you off,
but the chances are slim.

27:36.486 --> 27:40.323
If I'm discharged,
you'll be rewarded.

27:43.076 --> 27:46.288
There is a problem.

27:46.496 --> 27:48.498
Salina is testifying for them.

27:48.665 --> 27:50.208
Testifying for them?

27:50.375 --> 27:55.172
She's out on bail. The cop
that nailed you is guarding her now.

27:57.883 --> 28:02.512
Salina doesn't know much.
She's new.

28:02.679 --> 28:07.475
That doesn't concern me.
She might surprise us.

28:08.977 --> 28:16.151
Could be. Call Danny.

28:17.652 --> 28:20.197
Tell him to take care of her.

28:21.031 --> 28:21.698
All right.

28:26.286 --> 28:28.371
- Here.
- Keep the change.

28:28.663 --> 28:29.664
Thank you.

28:34.294 --> 28:37.088
It's dangerous to be alone.

28:37.255 --> 28:39.716
I'd like to see
how dangerous it can be.

28:50.852 --> 28:55.649
- Hello? I'm home now.
<i>- Someone's listening.</i>

28:56.483 --> 28:59.903
Let's meet and talk later.

30:03.717 --> 30:05.176
Try another.

30:40.837 --> 30:42.714
You can't scare me easily.

30:48.511 --> 30:49.804
Help me!

30:57.896 --> 30:59.147
Help me!

30:59.314 --> 31:00.732
I'm going to shut you up!

31:09.074 --> 31:11.493
I'm going to carve you up right now!

31:13.787 --> 31:14.996
I'm going to kill you!

31:20.085 --> 31:22.295
I'm going to kill you!

31:22.837 --> 31:24.089
You're finished!

31:32.931 --> 31:34.015
I'm going to...

31:34.224 --> 31:35.392
...shut you UP!

31:53.326 --> 31:55.412
There's no way out!

31:57.122 --> 31:58.415
Stop running!

32:02.377 --> 32:04.379
No escape now!

32:04.754 --> 32:06.464
There's no way out!

32:11.344 --> 32:13.638
You're finished!

32:16.224 --> 32:18.893
Let me chop you up!

32:19.060 --> 32:22.939
Rm gonna get you!

32:23.857 --> 32:25.316
Here.

32:28.486 --> 32:31.072
I'm here to rescue you.

32:36.202 --> 32:38.872
She's terrified.
Can I quit now?

32:39.038 --> 32:41.708
Yes, you can go anytime.

32:49.257 --> 32:52.343
Hold on to him.
I'll call the police.

33:01.936 --> 33:03.396
Cut the telephone line.

33:20.872 --> 33:22.874
I knocked him out!
I knocked him out!

33:24.292 --> 33:30.673
Not yet. He's still fighting back.
Don't come near.

33:32.550 --> 33:36.846
Go, you can't be here.
Don't faint. Go.

33:41.976 --> 33:42.644
He passed out.

33:44.604 --> 33:46.606
No, he's not totally out.

33:52.445 --> 33:58.535
Go, don't faint.
Go, go, you can't stay.

34:02.997 --> 34:04.290
Stop acting, go, hurry.

34:07.210 --> 34:08.378
Let me help!

34:09.545 --> 34:11.630
He fainted.

34:13.257 --> 34:14.342
Yes, for real.

34:14.509 --> 34:16.219
He is faking it.

34:18.846 --> 34:21.641
Don't smash his face.
It's for identification.

34:21.808 --> 34:24.476
No, it shouldn't be like this.

34:33.069 --> 34:34.404
I don't know him.

34:34.571 --> 34:36.989
Of course,
they'd hire stranger to kill you.

34:37.156 --> 34:38.658
Chu wants me dead?

34:38.824 --> 34:42.704
Sure, he's capable of anything.

34:42.870 --> 34:45.331
Inspector Chou, this is Ka-Kui.

34:45.498 --> 34:48.918
It's such a tough case.
Please send a replacement.

34:49.085 --> 34:54.799
No? I won't risk my life,
it's just a job.

34:54.966 --> 34:56.884
I might as well be a mercenary.

34:57.051 --> 34:59.137
Well, let her take care of herself.

35:00.722 --> 35:03.600
I'll quit, then, never mind.

35:06.978 --> 35:08.938
- Where are you going?
- Home.

35:09.105 --> 35:11.773
What? Home?
You're here to protect me.

35:11.774 --> 35:14.277
But you're so uncooperative.
How can I work it out?

35:14.444 --> 35:17.614
What do you have in mind?

35:17.780 --> 35:20.742
Nothing. I'm quitting.

35:28.666 --> 35:32.711
Where's your sense of duty?

35:32.712 --> 35:36.841
But there's nothing I can do.
We both will die.

35:37.008 --> 35:40.303
I'll cooperate.

35:41.846 --> 35:44.307
Don't force yourself.

35:45.391 --> 35:47.852
I am doing it of my own free will.

35:48.019 --> 35:51.022
It'll be safer at my place.

35:51.189 --> 35:53.483
- Okay. Let's go.
- Like this?

35:53.650 --> 35:57.195
- I'll go change.
- Chu's men will return anytime.

35:57.362 --> 36:00.657
I won't change, then.
What now?

36:04.035 --> 36:05.662
There.

36:09.832 --> 36:10.875
What's going on?

36:11.042 --> 36:13.961
I'll take a good look.

36:18.049 --> 36:19.759
Stay behind.

36:21.094 --> 36:22.970
Come.

36:28.893 --> 36:30.687
Why are you carrying it?

36:30.978 --> 36:31.979
I'm safeguarding your jacket.

36:32.397 --> 36:35.233
- I told you to wear it.
- Yes.

36:35.650 --> 36:37.819
Stay close to me.

36:43.825 --> 36:45.076
Use my car.

36:45.493 --> 36:48.162
- All these cars are yours.
- No, just this one.

36:56.379 --> 36:57.588
Why aren't you nervous?

36:58.423 --> 37:01.259
I'm used to this.

37:03.344 --> 37:05.555
- See, I told you to keep quiet.
- What now?

37:06.514 --> 37:09.225
- You hurt?
- My kid.

37:11.602 --> 37:12.812
Close the door.

37:55.813 --> 37:57.814
It's me, it's me.

37:57.815 --> 37:58.983
Get my gun.

38:05.990 --> 38:07.408
My gun is in the pocket.

38:25.176 --> 38:26.677
Stop running.

38:35.853 --> 38:36.562
Freeze!

38:40.024 --> 38:40.650
Freeze!

38:43.611 --> 38:46.948
- Take it easy. Give me the gun.
- Don't come near.

38:52.245 --> 38:52.995
Let's scram.

38:56.916 --> 38:59.043
Give me the gun.
It's me. Give me the gun.

39:10.471 --> 39:14.183
- Are you all right?
- Where are they?

39:14.350 --> 39:18.771
Don't get trigger-happy.
Let's leave now. They are for real.

39:20.273 --> 39:22.900
For real?
How about at my place?

39:23.609 --> 39:26.529
He was for real,
and these guys are professionals.

39:27.905 --> 39:29.782
That's why you are more nervous.

39:29.991 --> 39:31.158
Get in.

39:41.669 --> 39:43.921
You are human, after all.

39:44.088 --> 39:47.550
- I didn't expect Chu to do this to me.
- Don't be naive.

39:47.717 --> 39:51.637
He is capable of anything.

39:51.804 --> 39:53.389
He will make sure
you won't be in court.

39:53.556 --> 39:54.682
What now?

39:54.849 --> 39:57.560
Speak out in court tomorrow.

39:57.727 --> 40:00.021
Put him in jail, and you'll be safe.

40:00.980 --> 40:02.940
What should I say?

40:03.983 --> 40:06.986
What business he's in,
who his contacts are,

40:07.153 --> 40:10.781
number of drug deals.

40:10.948 --> 40:15.161
- Why are you taping all this?
- Taking notes.

40:15.328 --> 40:18.247
- When did you start working for him?
- Four years ago.

40:20.875 --> 40:25.087
He's a family friend. Mom said
he always lent us milk money.

40:25.296 --> 40:30.968
- Now you help him sell drugs.
- I know very little.

40:31.135 --> 40:33.054
Tell me everything you know.

40:36.766 --> 40:40.728
Anything else you want to add,
tell me later upstairs.

40:40.895 --> 40:43.564
What I've said is enough
to put him in jail?

40:43.731 --> 40:47.944
I'm not the prosecutor.
But what you've said will be useful.

40:55.451 --> 40:58.704
Come in.

41:01.040 --> 41:02.917
I'll turn on the light.

41:06.837 --> 41:10.174
May... I've almost forgotten
it's my birthday.

41:12.259 --> 41:14.261
Are you all right?

41:21.310 --> 41:23.729
Let me introduce May.
This is Miss Fong.

41:34.031 --> 41:37.326
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

41:37.493 --> 41:38.703
May!

41:42.331 --> 41:46.002
All gone? What's the hurry?

41:46.168 --> 41:49.296
It's my fault.
She wanted to surprise you.

41:49.463 --> 41:53.050
And you brought home a girl
dressed like this.

41:53.217 --> 41:56.721
- Who wouldn't be angry?
- I can be angry too.

41:56.887 --> 41:58.639
She didn't even let me explain.

41:58.806 --> 42:00.808
Leaving me the whole cake.

42:00.975 --> 42:03.811
This time I won't forgive her,
no matter what.

42:03.978 --> 42:05.688
I don't think she will.

42:06.564 --> 42:10.401
I knew she'd be back.

42:15.072 --> 42:16.115
Happy birthday.

42:17.658 --> 42:19.076
Why so happy?

42:19.243 --> 42:20.202
Why is May in rage?

42:20.703 --> 42:22.496
She saw me bringing a girl home.

42:22.663 --> 42:24.665
I'll explain it to her.

42:24.832 --> 42:28.961
No need.
Tell her to curb her temper.

42:31.464 --> 42:34.633
I even have to explain things
to crooks.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.260
I'm sick and tired of explaining.

42:36.427 --> 42:38.345
Care for a piece of cake?

42:38.512 --> 42:40.639
- Anything to drink?
- Orange juice. Thanks.

42:40.806 --> 42:41.807
Help yourself.

42:49.273 --> 42:51.734
You live by yourself?

42:51.901 --> 42:54.194
A big place!
Don't I worry about the ICAC?

42:54.195 --> 42:56.489
I share it with a friend.
He's on vacation.

42:56.655 --> 43:00.409
Sorry, your girlfriend
must be mad at me.

43:00.576 --> 43:04.663
Never mind.
That's part of the job.

43:08.542 --> 43:11.170
Come on, inside.

43:11.545 --> 43:14.130
- It's okay.
- Wait.

43:14.131 --> 43:15.800
See you later.

43:22.056 --> 43:24.850
Now I am just a cop,
but I might become a movie star.

43:25.017 --> 43:27.728
And would have to kiss
the ladies passionately.

43:27.895 --> 43:29.396
What would she do then?

43:34.151 --> 43:37.613
She's jealous because she loves you.
I'll explain it to her.

43:37.780 --> 43:39.824
What for?
She's such a narrow-minded kid.

43:39.990 --> 43:41.158
It'll only spoil her.

43:41.325 --> 43:44.453
Aren't you going to say
something nice to her?

43:44.620 --> 43:46.205
Not a chance.

43:46.372 --> 43:50.250
If I care to sweet-talk,
I could have hundreds of girls.

43:50.251 --> 43:53.129
She'll have to wait for her turn.

43:55.172 --> 43:57.633
Don't you like her?

43:57.800 --> 44:00.302
Frankly, yes.

44:00.469 --> 44:04.849
But that's no reason
for me to apologize.

44:05.015 --> 44:10.228
The next move is hers.

44:10.229 --> 44:11.856
What a waste of food.

44:22.408 --> 44:26.162
See, she couldn't
even wait to get home.

44:26.328 --> 44:31.000
- Hello?
- Is it your girlfriend?

44:31.167 --> 44:34.837
Yes, she's speechless with tears.

44:36.213 --> 44:39.299
Stop crying.
You should have behaved yourself.

44:39.300 --> 44:41.010
What misunderstanding?

44:41.177 --> 44:43.429
What? If I were with a man,
you would think I am gay.

44:43.596 --> 44:46.432
You are narrow-minded.
Just think about what you did.

44:46.599 --> 44:47.600
- What...?
- Let me explain it to her.

44:47.766 --> 44:48.976
No need.

44:49.143 --> 44:52.312
Unless you promise
to control your temper.

44:52.313 --> 44:53.856
Show me respect
in front of my friends.

44:54.023 --> 44:56.483
Stop crying! Bye!

44:56.650 --> 44:58.777
I must teach her a lesson.

45:10.247 --> 45:11.957
When did she come in?

45:12.124 --> 45:14.585
Since you went into shower.

45:14.752 --> 45:16.879
So she heard everything?

45:17.630 --> 45:18.714
The phone?

45:28.015 --> 45:32.394
That's not fair.
May! May!

45:36.315 --> 45:37.816
Listen to me, May.

45:37.983 --> 45:39.735
She's our witness
under my protection.

45:39.902 --> 45:42.238
I'm mad at what you just said.

45:42.529 --> 45:43.864
You should know I was kidding.

45:44.031 --> 45:46.659
Didn't I call first
every time we had a fight?

45:46.825 --> 45:49.078
But you treat me badly
in front of another girl.

45:49.245 --> 45:51.330
You don't care about me.

45:51.497 --> 45:55.125
- Go away! Go away!
- Listen to me, May.

45:58.921 --> 46:02.466
- Are you hurt?
- It hurts! Go away! Happy now?

46:02.633 --> 46:04.677
Happy?
It hurts me too.

46:04.843 --> 46:06.303
I'll get it for you.

46:06.470 --> 46:09.265
Put on the shoes first.

46:09.682 --> 46:11.307
- Go away!
- Listen to me, May.

46:11.308 --> 46:13.352
No, no!

46:13.852 --> 46:15.646
Control yourself.

46:15.854 --> 46:18.065
Can you just listen to me?

46:18.232 --> 46:19.358
Let go!

46:27.324 --> 46:28.826
I hate you.

47:03.694 --> 47:04.737
Where's your girlfriend?

47:05.237 --> 47:09.575
I accepted her apology.
She went home happily.

47:09.867 --> 47:11.744
What are you doing?

47:11.910 --> 47:13.037
Nothing.

47:13.203 --> 47:15.456
It hurts.

47:17.124 --> 47:20.794
It's breaking. Easy.

47:21.754 --> 47:26.050
What an ugly thing.
Get rid of it.

47:26.258 --> 47:27.968
What? It's precious to me.

47:34.183 --> 47:38.520
- You made me all wet.
- I'll wipe it for you.

47:39.646 --> 47:44.818
Oh, no more.
Not there. Here!

47:44.985 --> 47:47.279
Here?

47:47.446 --> 47:51.200
Easy. You're so rough.

47:58.123 --> 48:02.252
It's so uncomfortable on the sofa.
Let's go to bed.

48:03.670 --> 48:04.838
Okay, let's go.

48:05.005 --> 48:06.173
Where do I sleep?

48:07.007 --> 48:07.841
In my bed.

48:08.175 --> 48:09.218
How about you?

48:09.635 --> 48:14.515
- Next to you.
- I like your style.

48:30.114 --> 48:34.535
I'm going to sleep now.
Don't disturb me.

48:36.078 --> 48:39.331
Women are strange.

48:54.930 --> 48:59.475
- Hello?
- Ka-Kui? Hold on, it's him.

48:59.476 --> 49:01.812
Ka-Kui, they're waiting at the court.

49:01.979 --> 49:03.856
She's gone already.
Maybe there's a traffic jam.

49:04.022 --> 49:06.942
Stop fooling.
Bring the witness, hurry.

49:20.998 --> 49:22.291
What was your duty that day?

49:22.458 --> 49:25.836
I was observing the squatter huts
behind the site.

49:26.003 --> 49:27.880
There were about a dozen suspects
getting away.

49:28.046 --> 49:29.631
I arrested the 6th
and the 7th defendants.

49:29.798 --> 49:31.258
Thank you.

49:31.967 --> 49:35.596
Your Honor,
allow me to question the witness.

49:35.762 --> 49:40.267
Mr. Gahn, you said you saw
a dozen suspects escaping.

49:40.434 --> 49:44.354
Did all 13 suspects pass
in front of you one by one?

49:44.521 --> 49:47.649
Or do you have
a new electronic device

49:47.816 --> 49:51.028
to enable you to see
all the action at once?

49:51.945 --> 49:52.529
I object.

49:53.155 --> 49:57.409
The question played with the witness's
wording to undermine his credibility.

49:57.576 --> 49:58.535
Objection overruled.

49:59.453 --> 50:01.497
Thank you.
No more questions.

50:02.247 --> 50:04.541
Bring in the next witness.

50:27.064 --> 50:29.483
- You took my parking space.
- I'm in a hurry.

50:30.943 --> 50:32.819
Don't be long.
I want that space.

50:33.946 --> 50:35.906
Nice parking job.

50:46.959 --> 50:50.712
What? Gone?
I'll have your butt for it.

50:50.879 --> 50:52.631
- Now what?
- I can't think of anything.

50:52.798 --> 50:53.590
It's hopeless.

50:53.757 --> 50:56.677
Tell me, when you saw
the suspect running,

50:56.843 --> 51:00.973
what made you think
he was my client?

51:01.139 --> 51:02.683
By his clothes and his build.

51:02.849 --> 51:06.353
That means you didn't see
his face clearly.

51:06.520 --> 51:08.063
You can say that.

51:10.190 --> 51:11.650
Are you nearsighted?

51:11.817 --> 51:13.026
No.

51:13.193 --> 51:16.113
Good.
No more questions.

51:16.280 --> 51:17.614
Next witness.

51:32.963 --> 51:35.215
...and nothing but the truth.

51:51.064 --> 51:53.400
I was at the squatter huts on duty.

51:53.567 --> 51:57.695
The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th defendants
opened fire.

51:57.696 --> 52:00.949
They got on a bus.
And I took a shortcut.

52:01.116 --> 52:06.371
A civilian used his car
to block the bus.

52:06.538 --> 52:08.624
Three defendants fell off the bus.

52:08.790 --> 52:11.168
I arrested the 1st defendant
on the bus.

52:11.335 --> 52:13.045
He tried to bribe me

52:13.211 --> 52:15.714
- ...but I refused.
- Mark this down.

52:15.881 --> 52:18.592
Very clear, thank you.

52:20.135 --> 52:24.264
You said you were
at the squatter huts.

52:24.431 --> 52:26.682
- What time was it?
- It was about six.

52:26.683 --> 52:28.935
- About six?
- 5:55.

52:29.102 --> 52:30.312
So let's say 6:00.

52:30.479 --> 52:35.734
Do you know, in December,
the sun rises after 6:23?

52:35.901 --> 52:37.402
No.

52:37.569 --> 52:38.737
Is that right?

52:38.904 --> 52:39.696
How would I know?

52:39.863 --> 52:43.241
Do you know that saying
"darkness before dawn"?

52:43.408 --> 52:44.284
No.

52:44.451 --> 52:50.290
That means that there is darkness
before the sun rises.

52:50.457 --> 52:51.833
I might have heard of that.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.961
Great, under such circumstances,

52:55.128 --> 52:59.091
should we believe you actually
saw my client as a suspect?

52:59.257 --> 53:01.843
To believe it or not
is your business.

53:03.261 --> 53:07.057
You said you took
the shortcut to stop the bus.

53:07.224 --> 53:10.227
Was the bus always in your sight?

53:10.560 --> 53:12.521
Yes.

53:12.688 --> 53:13.813
Why did you hesitate?

53:13.814 --> 53:14.731
I want to be sure.

53:14.898 --> 53:16.358
That means you are a bit doubtful.

53:16.525 --> 53:17.067
I object.

53:17.234 --> 53:18.443
Objection sustained.

53:18.610 --> 53:20.820
Witness should be sure
of his answer.

53:20.821 --> 53:24.199
How much time did you take
to go down the hill?

53:24.366 --> 53:27.202
And you kept the bus
in sight all the time?

53:27.369 --> 53:30.831
I was rushing down.
My sight was blocked momentarily.

53:30.997 --> 53:36.211
Maybe during this short while,
another bus overtook the original one.

53:36.378 --> 53:37.838
There was only one bus on the road.

53:38.004 --> 53:39.755
- You are lying.
- I object.

53:39.756 --> 53:41.425
Sustained.

53:41.591 --> 53:45.011
Defense should rephrase
his question.

53:45.178 --> 53:47.806
- Are you lying?
- No.

53:47.973 --> 53:51.435
Do you know there are four lines
of bus routes passing there?

53:51.601 --> 53:55.272
Two of the lines have a bus
running every five minutes.

53:55.439 --> 53:58.066
The other two, every six minutes.

53:58.233 --> 54:01.819
That means 88 buses
are passing through per hour.

54:01.820 --> 54:05.323
That means more than one bus
per minute.

54:05.490 --> 54:06.158
I didn't know.

54:06.324 --> 54:08.784
From the time you went down
to stop the bus,

54:08.785 --> 54:09.786
how much time went by?

54:09.953 --> 54:12.122
- About two minutes.
- More precisely.

54:12.289 --> 54:13.206
Two and half minutes.

54:13.373 --> 54:15.167
That means at least two
or three buses would have gone by.

54:15.333 --> 54:17.043
Or even up to seven or eight.

54:17.210 --> 54:20.172
But you said only one.
That's lying.

54:20.338 --> 54:22.215
Haven't you ever waited
for a bus for half an hour?

54:28.847 --> 54:33.018
So, let's say there was only one bus.

54:33.185 --> 54:36.563
And you insisted
you saw the bus all the time.

54:36.730 --> 54:40.108
Can you tell the court which part
of the bus was in your sight?

54:40.275 --> 54:42.277
- The whole bus.
- All of it?

54:42.444 --> 54:45.113
- All of it.
- You are lying.

54:46.198 --> 54:46.948
Now what?

54:47.824 --> 54:52.953
You saw only one side of the bus.
No more than 50%, that's half.

54:52.954 --> 54:56.583
You couldn't see the other half,
right?

54:56.750 --> 54:57.292
Yes.

54:57.959 --> 55:01.338
On the other side,
which you couldn't see,

55:01.505 --> 55:03.006
anything could have happened there.

55:03.173 --> 55:04.257
Yes.

55:04.424 --> 55:07.427
Anyone who jumped off the bus
would be unseen.

55:07.594 --> 55:08.970
Yes.

55:09.137 --> 55:10.806
Louder, please.

55:10.972 --> 55:12.932
I could jump, but not him.

55:12.933 --> 55:15.185
Just answer the questions.
No comments, please.

55:15.352 --> 55:19.064
You think anyone can jump off a bus?
You try it.

55:19.231 --> 55:21.274
Calm down please,
Detective Chan.

55:21.441 --> 55:22.901
Why did he want to bribe me, then?

55:23.068 --> 55:23.902
How did he bribe you?

55:24.069 --> 55:26.196
He said I could have
the case of money if I let him go.

55:26.363 --> 55:30.075
If someone stopped the bus
and pointed a gun at you,

55:30.242 --> 55:31.243
what would you do?

55:31.409 --> 55:32.077
I object.

55:32.244 --> 55:33.787
Objection overruled.
You must answer.

55:35.205 --> 55:36.414
I'd give my money to him.

55:36.581 --> 55:40.377
That's what my client did
under the circumstances.

55:40.544 --> 55:41.461
Right, Detective?

55:41.628 --> 55:43.421
No. I had shown my I.D.

55:43.588 --> 55:44.923
Do you know
how many cases there are

55:45.090 --> 55:46.424
where robbers pretended to be cops?

55:46.591 --> 55:48.051
I object.

55:48.218 --> 55:49.052
Objection sustained.

55:50.136 --> 55:53.889
Please ask relevant questions only.

55:53.890 --> 55:55.392
My apology.

55:55.559 --> 55:57.394
It happened like this...

55:57.561 --> 56:00.522
A business man
was on the way to a deal.

56:00.689 --> 56:05.068
A heroic policeman
pointed a gun at him by mistake.

56:05.235 --> 56:07.904
The business man
thought he was a robber.

56:08.071 --> 56:12.242
So he told the robber
he could have the money.

56:12.409 --> 56:14.703
Is that right?

56:16.705 --> 56:17.539
I object.

56:18.415 --> 56:19.875
You don't have to answer.

56:21.543 --> 56:23.461
But we all know the answer.

56:23.628 --> 56:25.422
No need for Detective Chan
to say it out loud.

56:25.589 --> 56:27.132
I have finished.

56:31.428 --> 56:32.387
Great.

56:32.554 --> 56:34.139
- Now what?
- I know what to do.

56:34.306 --> 56:36.391
- It's unfair to let him free.
- Of course.

56:41.563 --> 56:45.191
We request for postponement
since our prime witness is absent.

56:45.358 --> 56:46.067
I object.

56:46.234 --> 56:49.070
A postponement is unfair to my client.

56:49.237 --> 56:51.948
The prosecution has
little evidence to charge my client.

56:52.115 --> 56:53.909
I ask Your Honor
to dismiss the case.

56:54.075 --> 56:57.746
We have a taped evidence
from our witness.

56:57.913 --> 56:59.915
But tape is not legal evidence.

57:00.081 --> 57:01.625
But the absent witness
plays a key role.

57:01.791 --> 57:02.959
I object.

57:03.752 --> 57:07.547
Since this is an important case,

57:07.714 --> 57:10.300
a postponement is unfair
to the defendant.

57:10.467 --> 57:14.220
I will grant him bail.
But we will hear that tape.

57:14.387 --> 57:17.265
This case is not over yet.

57:26.483 --> 57:29.819
Louder please.
Thank you.

57:53.760 --> 57:56.972
Your Honor, it's an old tape.

57:57.138 --> 57:59.099
Please keep on listening.

58:00.684 --> 58:02.102
It's coming up.

58:07.482 --> 58:08.733
<i>What are you doing?</i>

58:08.900 --> 58:10.110
<i>Nothing.</i>

58:10.276 --> 58:14.071
<i>It hurts.</i>

58:14.072 --> 58:19.076
<i>It's breaking. Easy.</i>

58:19.077 --> 58:23.665
<i>What an ugly thing.
Get rid of it.</i>

58:23.832 --> 58:27.544
<i>- What? It's precious to me.</i>
- It's a cactus.

58:27.711 --> 58:31.548
<i>- You made me all wet.
- I'll wipe it for you.</i>

58:31.715 --> 58:35.468
<i>Oh, no more.</i>

58:35.635 --> 58:37.846
<i>- Not there. Here!</i>
- I spilled the orange juice.

58:39.305 --> 58:42.851
It wasn't what you think.

58:45.145 --> 58:50.692
<i>It's so uncomfortable on the sofa.
Let's go to bed.</i>

58:50.900 --> 58:54.154
<i>- Okay. Let's go.
- Where do I sleep?</i>

58:54.571 --> 58:57.073
<i>- In my bed.
- How about you?</i>

58:57.240 --> 59:00.827
<i>- Next to you.
- I like your style.</i>

59:03.538 --> 59:04.706
They are here.

59:06.458 --> 59:10.712
Thank you for your cooperation.

59:10.879 --> 59:13.423
Not too close, please.

59:14.299 --> 59:17.594
- Get lost.
- Ka-Kui.

59:18.845 --> 59:22.807
- Give me a report of the whole case.
- Yes, Sir.

59:24.559 --> 59:26.227
- Boss...
- He's coming out now.

59:26.394 --> 59:29.814
Get lost! No photos!

59:35.028 --> 59:38.073
Reserve a room at the country club.

59:38.490 --> 59:41.493
- A toast to justice.
- Okay.

59:41.659 --> 59:45.288
- I must go, Mr. Chu.
- Thank you. Good-bye.

59:57.509 --> 01:00:01.346
Hire him as a prosecutor next time.

01:00:02.222 --> 01:00:05.308
It's time
for the Police Stories again.

01:00:05.475 --> 01:00:09.437
<i>We have a brave officer
as our guest.</i>

01:00:09.604 --> 01:00:15.150
<i>Sitting next to me is Detective Chan
from Special Forces.</i>

01:00:15.151 --> 01:00:17.695
<i>- Greetings, Detective Chan.
- Hello, everybody.</i>

01:00:18.196 --> 01:00:22.700
<i>After cracking down
the greatest drug case,</i>

01:00:22.867 --> 01:00:26.371
<i>you've become a familiar name
to every citizen.</i>

01:00:26.538 --> 01:00:31.417
<i>Would you please describe
the operation to us?</i>

01:00:32.418 --> 01:00:36.339
<i>The success is due to the teamwork
of the unit.</i>

01:00:36.506 --> 01:00:38.215
<i>I'm only one of them.</i>

01:00:38.216 --> 01:00:41.386
<i>We did a lot of homework.</i>

01:00:41.553 --> 01:00:44.764
<i>What makes Special Forces
so different?</i>

01:00:44.931 --> 01:00:49.853
<i>To be in the Special Forces,
one must be strong, swift and fast</i>

01:00:50.019 --> 01:00:51.980
<i>and have great will power.</i>

01:00:52.147 --> 01:00:54.774
- Boss.
- What is it?

01:00:54.941 --> 01:00:59.696
He is on the cover
of at least three different magazines.

01:00:59.863 --> 01:01:02.574
He's been nominated
for some award too.

01:01:13.251 --> 01:01:16.296
Oh, Thailand is out of stock.

01:01:16.462 --> 01:01:18.548
Why? They've all changed jobs?

01:01:18.715 --> 01:01:22.635
No, but all the goods
have gone to Uncle Joe.

01:01:22.802 --> 01:01:25.847
They want cash from us.

01:01:26.014 --> 01:01:29.267
- Boss, Mr. Cheung is here.
- Please, come in.

01:01:30.977 --> 01:01:34.898
Mr. Chu, I've received your check.
Thank you.

01:01:35.064 --> 01:01:37.066
Thank you.

01:01:37.442 --> 01:01:40.528
- How is it?
- I've studied with my colleagues.

01:01:40.695 --> 01:01:44.199
Things remained confiscated
during prosecution.

01:01:44.365 --> 01:01:46.075
That means I can't
get my stuff back yet.

01:01:46.242 --> 01:01:48.494
Including your passport
and your bank accounts.

01:01:48.661 --> 01:01:50.622
To them, it's just an intermission.

01:01:50.788 --> 01:01:54.751
If you are found guilty, all
of your property will be confiscated.

01:01:54.918 --> 01:01:57.879
I won't have money to escape even.

01:01:58.046 --> 01:02:01.424
- Boss, a call for you.
- Excuse me.

01:02:04.093 --> 01:02:06.303
Hi, Salina.

01:02:06.304 --> 01:02:08.932
It's so boring here.
I want to go out.

01:02:09.098 --> 01:02:10.600
You can't for the time being.

01:02:10.767 --> 01:02:12.309
I want to see you.

01:02:12.310 --> 01:02:15.313
Later, you can't show up yet.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.523
<i>The police are still looking for you.</i>

01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:23.738
I'm planning your Europe trip.
Once you're there, you'll be fine.

01:02:23.905 --> 01:02:25.240
Listen,

01:02:25.406 --> 01:02:28.326
<i>wait till everything's
quieted down.</i>

01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:33.873
Hello?

01:02:37.043 --> 01:02:39.336
Where were we?

01:02:39.337 --> 01:02:42.840
We were lucky this time.

01:02:43.007 --> 01:02:45.802
If they had more solid evidence
or if the police found Salina,

01:02:45.969 --> 01:02:46.970
it would be a different story.

01:02:47.136 --> 01:02:50.056
They won't find her.

01:02:50.223 --> 01:02:53.434
That's good, then.
I have to go. Bye.

01:02:53.601 --> 01:02:54.644
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:02:56.604 --> 01:03:00.775
Boss, he is right.
Salina is a problem.

01:03:00.942 --> 01:03:02.610
You can't hide her forever.

01:03:04.404 --> 01:03:08.950
I agree, Uncle. Seh Zhai Chun says
Detective Chan is asking about Salina.

01:03:09.117 --> 01:03:10.868
Can't we send her away?

01:03:11.035 --> 01:03:13.621
With a one-way ticket.

01:03:14.497 --> 01:03:19.252
Let's make use of the cop to kill her.

01:03:21.838 --> 01:03:24.507
There are lots of other
beautiful girls.

01:03:24.674 --> 01:03:28.094
We have all those beauty pageants.

01:03:30.805 --> 01:03:34.726
<i>- Detective Mao is here to see you.</i>
- Send him in.

01:03:34.892 --> 01:03:36.435
Hasn't he been paid?

01:03:36.436 --> 01:03:39.147
$100,000, but he said
he wants to retire early

01:03:39.314 --> 01:03:40.940
and start a small business.

01:03:41.441 --> 01:03:44.027
- What does he want?
- He wants more.

01:03:44.569 --> 01:03:47.780
- Detective Mao, please.
- Please, come in.

01:03:47.947 --> 01:03:49.115
- Mr. Chu.
- Sit down, please.

01:03:49.282 --> 01:03:51.367
Thank you.
I'm here for...

01:03:51.534 --> 01:03:56.455
You'd like to retire early
and start a small business.

01:03:56.456 --> 01:03:58.415
- I support your idea.
- Thank you.

01:03:58.416 --> 01:04:01.502
You are a man of substance.

01:04:01.669 --> 01:04:04.047
I'd like you to do
one more thing for me.

01:04:04.213 --> 01:04:05.423
What is it?

01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:09.010
We want that cop
disappeared forever.

01:04:17.185 --> 01:04:21.064
You want glory, I'll give you glory.

01:04:51.636 --> 01:04:53.179
I will give you a ticket for it.

01:04:55.848 --> 01:04:57.809
- 1985, come to patrol with me.
- Sir.

01:04:57.975 --> 01:04:59.434
- Yes, Sir.
- Detective Chan.

01:04:59.435 --> 01:05:00.103
Yes, Sir.

01:05:00.269 --> 01:05:02.939
If anything happens, call...

01:05:03.106 --> 01:05:05.482
- Call you with the radio.
- Call me at home.

01:05:05.483 --> 01:05:10.405
- But you'll be on patrol.
- We go by my home first.

01:05:20.832 --> 01:05:26.003
Excuse me,
I need to go to the bathroom.

01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:28.047
Don't break the John.

01:05:30.967 --> 01:05:32.468
Sha Tau Kok Station.

01:05:32.635 --> 01:05:34.637
You called, Detective Chan?

01:05:34.804 --> 01:05:37.306
Of course. Any information?

01:05:37.473 --> 01:05:39.767
Salina?
Give me more time.

01:05:39.934 --> 01:05:41.936
It's a tough job.

01:05:42.103 --> 01:05:44.272
Tough?
It's tough to get paid too.

01:05:44.439 --> 01:05:47.482
I know my job.
I'll do my best.

01:05:47.483 --> 01:05:50.445
What? Please hold.

01:05:52.697 --> 01:05:54.365
Sha Tau Kok Station...
Please hold.

01:05:56.367 --> 01:05:58.369
I'll give you three days.

01:05:58.536 --> 01:06:00.913
Three days?

01:06:02.665 --> 01:06:04.499
That's not enough.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:07.502
What, you need more time?
Four days, then.

01:06:07.503 --> 01:06:12.300
You'll be in trouble
if I get transferred. Bye.

01:06:15.136 --> 01:06:19.974
- Can I help you?
<i>- Ka-Kui, why do you put me on hold?</i>

01:06:20.141 --> 01:06:22.894
You want to speak to Detective Chan?
Just a second.

01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:28.566
Detective Chan, a call for you.
Thanks.

01:06:28.733 --> 01:06:30.735
- Can I help you?
<i>- This is May.</i>

01:06:30.902 --> 01:06:33.196
- May.
<i>- Who was it?</i>

01:06:33.362 --> 01:06:36.240
Yeah, that guy is rude.

01:06:36.407 --> 01:06:40.786
Lau, you should be polite
to civilians.

01:06:40.953 --> 01:06:43.580
Sorry.

01:06:43.581 --> 01:06:46.625
See. I've scolded him.
What is it. May?

01:06:46.626 --> 01:06:48.419
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:06:48.586 --> 01:06:52.006
Me? I'm speaking to you.

01:06:52.173 --> 01:06:53.424
<i>Have you eaten yet?</i>

01:06:53.591 --> 01:06:58.054
No. I'm cooking some noodles.
Have you eaten yet?

01:06:58.221 --> 01:07:00.389
<i>No.</i>

01:07:00.556 --> 01:07:04.727
Wait a second.

01:07:04.894 --> 01:07:06.896
Sha Tau Kok Station...
Please hold.

01:07:07.563 --> 01:07:11.609
- May.
<i>- My mom invited you to dinner.</i>

01:07:11.776 --> 01:07:14.946
Is that so?
Wait a minute.

01:07:15.112 --> 01:07:16.614
- Sha Tau Kok Station.
<i>- My husband beat me up.</i>

01:07:16.781 --> 01:07:18.074
What?
What about your husband?

01:07:18.241 --> 01:07:19.325
<i>He beat me up.</i>

01:07:19.492 --> 01:07:22.787
- You beat him up or he beat you up?
<i>- My husband beat me up.</i>

01:07:23.496 --> 01:07:27.875
Don't cry.
I'll give you the right line.

01:07:28.042 --> 01:07:31.337
May, I'm free Sunday.
Don't hang up.

01:07:31.504 --> 01:07:33.923
I'm still connecting to you.

01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:36.133
Sha Tau Kok Station...
Speak up.

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:37.176
<i>I've lost a cow.</i>

01:07:37.343 --> 01:07:41.681
Oh! I'll connect you
to Missing Persons.

01:07:41.847 --> 01:07:44.100
- It's busy. Sha Tau Kok Station.
<i>- I've been raped.</i>

01:07:44.267 --> 01:07:47.687
What? Rape?
Wait, let me write it down.

01:07:53.359 --> 01:07:56.904
- When were you raped?
<i>- Rape, no, my husband beat me up.</i>

01:07:57.071 --> 01:07:59.115
It's you who got beaten up
by the husband.

01:07:59.282 --> 01:08:00.699
- I'm still trying to connect you.
<i>- It takes too long.</i>

01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:04.078
It's a big station, be patient.
Hold on.

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.039
Who's been raped?

01:08:07.206 --> 01:08:08.791
<i>- Me.
- I've lost my cow.</i>

01:08:08.958 --> 01:08:10.960
The cow has to wait.

01:08:11.127 --> 01:08:13.379
- When were you raped?
<i>- Last year.</i>

01:08:13.546 --> 01:08:15.298
Last year?
Why report it now?

01:08:15.464 --> 01:08:17.383
<i>I want to know if there are
any afterward pills.</i>

01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:21.386
Pills? I'll find out for you.

01:08:21.554 --> 01:08:23.180
Hello, Missing Persons Department?

01:08:23.346 --> 01:08:24.307
<i>I've lost a cow.</i>

01:08:24.473 --> 01:08:28.644
Bring in a photo of the cow.

01:08:29.687 --> 01:08:33.274
Hello?

01:08:33.441 --> 01:08:36.444
May, I'm very busy.

01:08:36.611 --> 01:08:40.654
I pick a place for dinner?
Let me think.

01:08:40.656 --> 01:08:42.617
Hello?

01:08:42.783 --> 01:08:43.743
<i>Where shall we go?</i>

01:08:43.743 --> 01:08:45.328
Go to the Family
Planning Association.

01:08:45.493 --> 01:08:49.457
Tell her to take double the portion,
it's free.

01:08:50.791 --> 01:08:54.002
- May.
<i>- Tell my mom to take the pills?</i>

01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:56.756
What's up? May.

01:08:56.921 --> 01:08:59.925
"Tell my mom to take the pills"?

01:09:00.176 --> 01:09:00.968
Hello?

01:09:07.183 --> 01:09:09.310
Hello?

01:09:11.937 --> 01:09:15.524
"Tell my mom to take the pills"?
But she isn't pregnant.

01:10:28.681 --> 01:10:30.141
Sha Tau Kok Station.

01:10:30.307 --> 01:10:32.143
<i>This is a test call
from the phone company.</i>

01:10:33.144 --> 01:10:35.688
<i>Test call?</i>

01:10:47.783 --> 01:10:48.659
Is there a traffic jam?

01:10:50.369 --> 01:10:51.829
No, there's no traffic jam.

01:10:51.996 --> 01:10:52.997
What happened, then?

01:10:53.164 --> 01:10:56.791
If there was a jam,
I wouldn't be here yet.

01:10:56.792 --> 01:10:59.837
My mom hates people who are late.

01:11:00.004 --> 01:11:04.258
Let me explain, May. I've been
waiting for Seh Zhai Chun to call.

01:11:04.425 --> 01:11:06.093
Because of this case,
you've been transferred.

01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:08.387
- Why don't you leave this alone?
- I want to be satisfied.

01:11:11.015 --> 01:11:12.349
I'll return the call first.

01:11:13.851 --> 01:11:16.604
Hold on to the car.
The handbrake is broken.

01:11:16.771 --> 01:11:18.898
Hold on to it.

01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:31.619
Hello, Seh Zhai Chun?
It's me.

01:11:31.786 --> 01:11:33.120
The female witness
you are looking for

01:11:33.287 --> 01:11:36.915
is hiding in a villa
in Rosary village.

01:11:36.916 --> 01:11:39.543
Rosary village.

01:11:39.710 --> 01:11:43.506
Hurry up or Chu will kill her first.

01:11:43.672 --> 01:11:44.799
No kidding.

01:11:44.965 --> 01:11:48.177
I won't kid you. Hurry.

01:11:52.556 --> 01:11:53.849
- May.
- You're not coming to dinner?

01:11:54.016 --> 01:11:57.936
Chu's going to kill the witness.
I must go.

01:11:57.937 --> 01:11:59.063
No way!

01:11:59.230 --> 01:12:02.691
If she's dead, Chu's going to be free.
You know what Chu has done to me.

01:12:02.858 --> 01:12:05.236
And it's a matter of life and death.

01:12:05.402 --> 01:12:06.737
- What are you doing?
- The car...

01:12:14.787 --> 01:12:17.248
- What about the car?
- Taxi!

01:12:18.499 --> 01:12:20.501
Call a tow-truck.

01:12:20.668 --> 01:12:23.045
And apologize to your mom.
Bye.

01:12:24.797 --> 01:12:26.340
Be careful!

01:12:33.597 --> 01:12:35.641
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

01:13:47.212 --> 01:13:48.047
What happened?

01:13:48.213 --> 01:13:50.799
I don't know why they tied me up.

01:13:51.133 --> 01:13:54.553
- Anybody else here?
- They are all gone.

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.931
Now you know
what kind of person Chu is.

01:13:57.097 --> 01:14:01.268
If you had cooperated with us,
you wouldn't have gone through this.

01:14:01.977 --> 01:14:04.772
You're lucky I'm so well-informed.

01:14:04.939 --> 01:14:08.067
Or you'd be dead by now.

01:14:11.654 --> 01:14:14.281
Hurry up. Let's leave.

01:15:04.456 --> 01:15:06.250
Don't move.

01:15:12.631 --> 01:15:13.924
Step aside.

01:15:17.261 --> 01:15:19.722
How did you know I'd be here?

01:15:19.888 --> 01:15:21.473
Of course, I know.

01:15:29.773 --> 01:15:32.985
- It couldn't be...
- Surprised?

01:15:34.278 --> 01:15:36.488
There are a lot of surprises.

01:15:36.655 --> 01:15:38.032
Aren't we supposed
to follow the plan?

01:15:40.951 --> 01:15:42.870
Yes, indeed.

01:15:43.037 --> 01:15:47.499
But the boss wants to shoot a cop
with Chan's pistol.

01:15:47.666 --> 01:15:49.043
Once and for all.

01:15:50.461 --> 01:15:53.338
Shoot who?

01:16:05.184 --> 01:16:06.268
Let's get out of here.

01:16:13.108 --> 01:16:14.735
Hurry UP!

01:16:19.907 --> 01:16:22.785
Don't! I can't...

01:16:25.079 --> 01:16:25.829
No!

01:16:29.166 --> 01:16:32.753
Jump!

01:16:36.548 --> 01:16:38.801
Get out of here!

01:16:43.222 --> 01:16:44.223
Don't move.

01:16:48.727 --> 01:16:51.145
Get Salina.

01:16:51.146 --> 01:16:56.944
You are a worthy opponent.

01:17:04.243 --> 01:17:05.327
Enough!

01:17:07.246 --> 01:17:09.540
Take care of him.
I'll go clean up downstairs.

01:17:10.332 --> 01:17:12.543
I guarantee he didn't do that.

01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:15.379
We need proof.

01:17:15.546 --> 01:17:17.923
And find out why he disappeared
along with his gun.

01:17:18.090 --> 01:17:21.468
And the bullet is from his gun.

01:17:21.635 --> 01:17:24.388
- How do you explain it?
- A cop has a lot of enemies.

01:17:24.555 --> 01:17:26.431
Someone might want to frame him.

01:17:26.598 --> 01:17:30.310
If this had happened to a civilian,
what would we have done?

01:17:30.477 --> 01:17:34.565
We shouldn't always go by the book.

01:17:34.731 --> 01:17:36.191
We must also show trust in his men.

01:17:36.358 --> 01:17:37.985
I have nothing against Ka-Kui.

01:17:38.152 --> 01:17:41.446
I just want people to know that
we don't cover up our own faults.

01:17:41.613 --> 01:17:44.032
You don't understand
what a position I'm in.

01:17:44.199 --> 01:17:47.369
But I think you are overdoing it.

01:17:47.536 --> 01:17:53.625
What would you do
if you were in my shoes?

01:18:29.536 --> 01:18:31.830
Hello, May.

01:18:33.874 --> 01:18:35.417
Yes.

01:18:37.252 --> 01:18:39.004
I understand.

01:18:41.173 --> 01:18:44.843
I'll wait for you.

01:18:49.514 --> 01:18:50.307
SHOCKING NEW DEVELOPMENT

01:18:50.307 --> 01:18:51.058
KA-KUI CHAN
IS A DANGEROUS SUSPECT

01:18:51.225 --> 01:18:52.684
HUNDREDS ARE SEARCHING
FOR THE MISSING DETECTIVE

01:18:54.686 --> 01:18:55.771
What now?

01:18:59.983 --> 01:19:02.653
Mom is worried about you.

01:19:14.331 --> 01:19:18.961
Ka-Kui, be careful.

01:19:33.934 --> 01:19:35.227
Ka-Kui's back.

01:19:42.901 --> 01:19:44.319
- Ka-Kui's back.
- Right.

01:19:46.488 --> 01:19:49.116
- Ka-Kui.
- Ka-Kui.

01:19:53.829 --> 01:19:54.663
Ka-Kui.

01:19:56.707 --> 01:20:02.087
- I didn't do it.
- We know, but where have you been?

01:20:03.547 --> 01:20:06.133
- I don't know.
- Don't say you don't know.

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:08.760
Drunk? With a girl?

01:20:11.388 --> 01:20:13.432
I was fighting Chu's gang.

01:20:13.598 --> 01:20:16.184
Mao came in
and pointed his gun at me.

01:20:16.351 --> 01:20:19.521
They took my gun and shot Mao.

01:20:20.355 --> 01:20:21.398
And I can't remember the rest.

01:20:22.357 --> 01:20:23.150
You don't remember?

01:20:23.317 --> 01:20:24.901
Everyone knows you and Mao
weren't good friends.

01:20:25.068 --> 01:20:28.446
And your bullet was found in his body.

01:20:28.447 --> 01:20:30.406
I didn't kill him.

01:20:30.407 --> 01:20:31.992
I wouldn't do it
over such a small conflict.

01:20:32.159 --> 01:20:33.452
But who's going to believe you?

01:20:33.618 --> 01:20:38.332
We need proof.

01:20:38.498 --> 01:20:41.209
But at least you are back.
Hand in your gun first.

01:20:44.296 --> 01:20:45.339
Call homicide.

01:20:45.505 --> 01:20:47.591
The main suspect
has turned himself in.

01:20:47.758 --> 01:20:48.717
Get two men in here.

01:20:50.927 --> 01:20:55.682
Don't worry, we'll help you.

01:20:57.267 --> 01:20:59.144
- Take him to the cell.
- Yes, Sir.

01:20:59.311 --> 01:21:01.938
Charge him with first-degree murder.

01:21:06.234 --> 01:21:07.235
Sir...

01:21:10.572 --> 01:21:12.824
- Freeze!
- What are you doing, Ka-Kui?

01:21:12.991 --> 01:21:18.413
I didn't kill anybody!
Why charge me with murder?

01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:20.498
I didn't say you killed him.

01:21:20.499 --> 01:21:23.001
But I must charge you
according to the evidence.

01:21:23.168 --> 01:21:27.422
I've been framed.
Can't you tell?

01:21:27.589 --> 01:21:29.174
I'll look into it.

01:21:29.341 --> 01:21:31.468
Don't give me that!

01:21:31.635 --> 01:21:33.095
Ka-Kui, let him go!

01:21:36.056 --> 01:21:36.640
No!

01:21:37.224 --> 01:21:38.975
Ka-Kui, this is dangerous.

01:21:39.142 --> 01:21:41.019
It's dangerous for him.

01:21:41.186 --> 01:21:42.646
When we were risking our lives,

01:21:42.813 --> 01:21:45.023
he was sitting here
thinking of his girlfriends.

01:21:45.190 --> 01:21:48.402
We put the crooks under arrest,
he argued about procedure.

01:21:48.568 --> 01:21:52.197
And that stupid idea
of protecting the witness.

01:21:52.364 --> 01:21:57.202
Any command coming out from
his mouth, we have to risk our lives.

01:21:57.369 --> 01:21:58.495
- Ka-Kui!
- Shut up.

01:21:59.621 --> 01:22:01.748
You got promoted at our expense.

01:22:01.915 --> 01:22:04.209
Have you ever thought of us?

01:22:04.376 --> 01:22:06.044
When one of us was killed
in the line of duty,

01:22:06.211 --> 01:22:09.714
it meant to pay our respects at
the funeral and a full report to you.

01:22:09.881 --> 01:22:12.467
We are human too.

01:22:12.634 --> 01:22:14.344
If we hadn't fought for you,

01:22:14.511 --> 01:22:16.513
would you have
such a luxurious office?

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:17.848
- Ka-Kui!
- Get away!

01:22:18.849 --> 01:22:22.560
Don't come near,
or I'll shoot him!

01:22:22.561 --> 01:22:23.937
Ka-Kui, don't!

01:22:24.104 --> 01:22:26.523
Open up!

01:22:26.690 --> 01:22:30.610
- Listen to me!
- Don't come near!

01:22:30.777 --> 01:22:31.570
Please don't.

01:22:31.571 --> 01:22:36.408
Don't come near.
I know what I'm doing.

01:22:40.495 --> 01:22:41.997
- What a mess!
- What's the matter?

01:22:42.164 --> 01:22:43.331
Ka-Kui has the chief for a hostage.

01:22:44.291 --> 01:22:46.835
- Everyone stays where he is.
- Don't move.

01:22:47.711 --> 01:22:50.547
- Don't come near.
- Think carefully, Ka-Kui.

01:22:51.548 --> 01:22:53.300
Don't come near.

01:22:55.552 --> 01:22:58.889
- Ka-Kui! Don't!
- Let's talk about it.

01:22:59.055 --> 01:23:01.016
Right!
Let's talk about it.

01:23:01.183 --> 01:23:04.060
Hands on the table so I can see!

01:23:04.227 --> 01:23:05.312
On the table!

01:23:06.688 --> 01:23:08.148
This is very stupid.

01:23:08.315 --> 01:23:11.776
Calm down before it's too late.

01:23:11.943 --> 01:23:14.362
We'll clear you, trust us.

01:23:14.529 --> 01:23:17.949
I trust you,
but I can't depend on you.

01:23:18.116 --> 01:23:19.826
- But you'll be in deeper trouble.
- Don't push me!

01:23:20.118 --> 01:23:22.329
Freeze!

01:23:25.290 --> 01:23:29.127
- Ka-Kui!
- Don't push him!

01:23:29.294 --> 01:23:31.505
Don't push him.

01:23:31.671 --> 01:23:34.716
Alert all units,
send in sharpshooters.

01:23:53.527 --> 01:23:55.153
Easy, everybody.

01:24:00.283 --> 01:24:01.576
Ka-Kui!

01:24:09.626 --> 01:24:11.753
Get in the car.

01:24:13.046 --> 01:24:13.880
Ka-Kui.

01:24:14.339 --> 01:24:15.340
Drive off.

01:24:17.884 --> 01:24:19.261
Ka-Kui.

01:24:19.928 --> 01:24:20.845
Don't follow.

01:24:23.473 --> 01:24:24.808
The superintendent's life is at stake.

01:24:29.312 --> 01:24:30.146
Where to?

01:24:34.276 --> 01:24:35.527
Stop.

01:24:39.114 --> 01:24:39.739
Get off.

01:24:47.664 --> 01:24:50.625
I couldn't shoot
even if you didn't cooperate.

01:24:50.792 --> 01:24:55.589
I'm not sure how to help you.
Now you'll have a start.

01:24:57.173 --> 01:24:59.301
They will wait until I am back.

01:25:01.219 --> 01:25:04.472
I intend to get Chu
before your men get to me.

01:25:04.639 --> 01:25:08.351
From now on, be very careful.

01:25:08.518 --> 01:25:10.145
Thank you, Sir.

01:25:16.026 --> 01:25:19.112
But it's tough to find
where Salina is.

01:25:20.155 --> 01:25:23.658
Let's just get a couple of girls.

01:25:39.424 --> 01:25:45.263
He forced me to do it.
I have nothing to do with it.

01:25:48.808 --> 01:25:52.729
Eat this.

01:25:52.896 --> 01:25:57.275
I will eat it, then.
I'm hungry.

01:26:53.415 --> 01:26:56.292
Boss, that cop is on the loose.

01:26:56.710 --> 01:26:58.044
Didn't the police take him in?

01:26:58.211 --> 01:27:00.380
He kidnapped the superintendent.

01:27:00.547 --> 01:27:06.970
Great guy. We should have killed
him too. Once and for all.

01:27:07.137 --> 01:27:08.847
Where is Salina?

01:27:09.013 --> 01:27:11.141
Song Ming and Seh Zhai Chun
are on her heels.

01:27:11.307 --> 01:27:13.101
But no news yet.

01:27:13.268 --> 01:27:16.104
Would Salina be with the cop?

01:27:23.111 --> 01:27:24.362
What is it, Boss?

01:27:30.577 --> 01:27:32.162
Someone stole my data.

01:27:32.328 --> 01:27:33.871
- Who?
- Who?

01:27:33.872 --> 01:27:35.248
Must be Salina.

01:27:35.415 --> 01:27:36.958
Only she knows the code.

01:27:37.125 --> 01:27:38.293
Go get her.

01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:39.294
Alert all men.

01:27:39.461 --> 01:27:40.879
- Call Mr. Cheung.
- Yes.

01:27:55.894 --> 01:27:58.980
- How much longer?
- He'll show up soon.

01:27:59.147 --> 01:28:03.067
No, I'm scared.

01:28:14.996 --> 01:28:17.499
- You stand guard over there.
- Yes.

01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:31.429
Over there.

01:28:36.184 --> 01:28:38.061
Call Uncle Bill right now.

01:28:39.896 --> 01:28:41.314
Get the briefcase,
or we're all in trouble.

01:28:41.481 --> 01:28:43.066
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

01:29:21.729 --> 01:29:23.022
Over there, go!

01:29:27.193 --> 01:29:28.069
Ka-Kui!

01:29:28.987 --> 01:29:30.363
Why didn't you go to the police?

01:29:30.530 --> 01:29:31.906
They may have been Mao's cronies.

01:29:32.073 --> 01:29:33.992
You are my witness.
I'm counting on you.

01:29:34.158 --> 01:29:36.077
I've got evidence on Chu.

01:29:55.972 --> 01:29:57.265
Right here!

01:30:20.330 --> 01:30:22.582
Take her back to the office!
Hurry!

01:30:25.376 --> 01:30:27.754
What is going on?

01:30:36.512 --> 01:30:37.889
Let's go.

01:31:05.124 --> 01:31:05.917
Get him.

01:33:01.407 --> 01:33:03.493
Move away.

01:33:05.036 --> 01:33:06.412
- Let's go.
- No.

01:33:07.121 --> 01:33:08.498
I must kill him.

01:33:11.918 --> 01:33:13.002
I must kill him now.

01:34:28.953 --> 01:34:29.704
Catch!

01:34:32.206 --> 01:34:33.541
It's there, get it back!

01:34:37.170 --> 01:34:38.379
May!

01:34:38.546 --> 01:34:39.422
Are you hurt, Ka-Kui?

01:34:39.589 --> 01:34:42.008
Get the briefcase!

01:34:50.141 --> 01:34:51.559
Go to hell!

01:34:55.396 --> 01:34:57.231
Tao Chu!

01:35:02.778 --> 01:35:03.905
Hurry!

01:35:12.371 --> 01:35:13.039
Let's go.

01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:43.402
Easy, Ka-Kui!

01:35:48.032 --> 01:35:49.867
- Put down the weapon.
- We'll take over.

01:35:50.117 --> 01:35:52.119
- Ka-Kui.
- This is between us.

01:35:52.286 --> 01:35:54.288
The law will take care of it.

01:35:54.455 --> 01:35:57.290
The law?
There is no justice.

01:35:57.291 --> 01:36:00.169
- The law is on his side.
- Don't do anything foolish.

01:36:00.336 --> 01:36:02.088
I could kill him now with no regrets.

01:36:02.255 --> 01:36:05.007
Chu's nephew killed Mao.

01:36:06.425 --> 01:36:08.886
All evidence is in the briefcase.

01:36:14.308 --> 01:36:17.353
- Are you all right?
- May is hurt. Take care of her first.

01:36:25.111 --> 01:36:27.280
Block all exits, take them all in!

01:36:27.446 --> 01:36:29.031
You cops are going too far.

01:36:29.198 --> 01:36:32.243
Assaulting innocent citizens
in public.

01:36:34.328 --> 01:36:37.290
You are not above the law.

01:36:37.456 --> 01:36:39.374
On behalf of my client,
I'm going to sue you

01:36:39.375 --> 01:36:44.630
for threat, false arrest and assault
with intention to harm.

01:36:44.797 --> 01:36:49.552
This is miscarriage of justice,
disturbance of peace.

01:36:52.555 --> 01:36:54.765
- You can all see.
- Let go, Ka-Kui.

01:36:54.932 --> 01:36:57.768
- Don't fall into his trap.
- Get ready for jail.

01:36:57.935 --> 01:37:00.104
Threatening the lawyer!

01:37:00.271 --> 01:37:02.565
Thanks for coming.

01:37:06.277 --> 01:37:07.403
You...

01:37:23.711 --> 01:37:25.671
You must help me with the report.

01:37:25.838 --> 01:37:27.214
What are you talking about?

01:37:27.381 --> 01:37:28.716
Let's write it together.

01:37:28.883 --> 01:37:30.885
I didn't see anything.

01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:44.815
Ka-Kui, that's enough.
Let's go.
