WEBVTT

00:05.880 --> 00:07.966
So, who's got the power
in this city?

00:10.218 --> 00:11.261
The Falcones?

00:12.637 --> 00:13.888
Sofia's the last of them.

00:13.972 --> 00:15.765
She don't even like
her fucking name.

00:16.516 --> 00:17.767
Maronis?

00:17.851 --> 00:19.936
Sure, Sal's out of Blackgate,

00:20.020 --> 00:21.479
but his family's
still fucking ash.

00:22.313 --> 00:24.607
So, who's got the power, huh?

00:25.608 --> 00:27.110
That's what
the streets are asking.

00:28.069 --> 00:29.070
But down here,

00:29.779 --> 00:30.780
we know.

00:43.918 --> 00:47.213
We started with two buckets,
two fuckin' buckets. That's it.

00:48.214 --> 00:50.508
And now, it's grown
into an underground empire.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.845
Cookin' and sellin' Bliss
under our label.

00:54.804 --> 00:57.349
You know how many boroughs
there are in Gotham?

00:58.433 --> 01:00.685
Each one run
by a different crew.

01:00.769 --> 01:03.063
All of them looking
for a way to get theirs.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.817
The more drugs we smuggle,
the more cash we bring in.

01:07.901 --> 01:08.985
That's food on the table

01:09.069 --> 01:10.570
and clothes
on your backs, fellas.

01:13.656 --> 01:15.533
And look, this ain't the game
you're used to.

01:15.617 --> 01:18.244
I get it.
You won't see any trouble.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.497
As long as your mouths
stay shut, you understand?

01:20.997 --> 01:23.708
Silence is golden,
loose lips, and all that shit.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.752
Remember, if somebody asks you
where you got this cash...

01:25.835 --> 01:27.462
-I say construction.
-Construction.

01:27.545 --> 01:28.755
We're all in construction.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.507
He has returned.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.133
Well, what did Donny Boy say?

01:32.217 --> 01:33.218
He's stoked.

01:33.301 --> 01:34.678
Sullivans moving our product
or what?

01:34.761 --> 01:36.805
Said they could sell Bliss
as fast as we can make it.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.723
Fuckin' right, they can.
Show me what you got.

01:39.473 --> 01:41.643
Kid, kid, not bad.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.269
Make a businessman
out of you yet.

01:45.188 --> 01:46.856
If we can get
a couple more gangs onboard,

01:46.940 --> 01:47.982
we're fuckin' set.

01:48.566 --> 01:49.859
Check this out.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.696
We finally got the line cleared
to Burnley, right?

01:52.779 --> 01:54.948
Means we can supply
the Massive now, too.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.658
-Oh, that's awesome.
-Look. Boom, boom, boom.

01:57.741 --> 01:58.827
But there's a lot bad blood

01:58.910 --> 02:00.370
between them
and the Odessa Mob, right?

02:00.453 --> 02:01.913
All these gangs
fucking hate each other.

02:01.996 --> 02:03.623
So we gotta make sure
that nobody advertises

02:03.707 --> 02:04.624
that we're...

02:04.749 --> 02:06.710
you know, we're dating around.
All right?

02:06.793 --> 02:08.586
Fuck this.

02:08.669 --> 02:10.045
Jesus Christ!

02:10.130 --> 02:11.506
Anyway, Bruno's got Odessa.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.633
I got Nick taking care
of the LoBoys.

02:13.717 --> 02:15.218
I even got Link.
He's hitting me up,

02:15.301 --> 02:16.553
saying Zhao
might wanna play ball

02:16.636 --> 02:18.304
now he sees all the money
we got coming in.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.640
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, greedy fuck.

02:21.182 --> 02:22.851
But the Triads,
they got the connects

02:22.934 --> 02:24.519
to take our operation
international.

02:24.602 --> 02:26.813
It's a whole different sport.
That's where all the money's at.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.651
Hey, Zeke. Zeke!

02:32.819 --> 02:34.070
Where are we at with the power?

02:34.154 --> 02:35.655
Gennies ain't gonna
hold us much longer.

02:35.739 --> 02:36.865
I'm working on it, boss.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.408
But City Hall's rationing
electricity,

02:38.491 --> 02:39.993
sending it all
to the rich neighborhoods.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.578
Of course they are,
fucking pricks!

02:41.661 --> 02:42.954
All right, just keep trying.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.040
Good, fellas?

02:45.665 --> 02:47.417
Oz, uh...

02:47.500 --> 02:49.252
-When I made that drop...
-Yeah?

02:50.045 --> 02:51.671
...someone had eyes on
the Sullivans.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.549
-Whaddya mean?
-Think it was probably one of...

02:54.632 --> 02:57.594
S-Sal or Sofia's guys.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.304
-Yeah?
-He tried to follow me.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.890
-He see you go underground?
-No. No.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.725
-You sure?
-Positive.

03:03.808 --> 03:05.477
All right. As long
as we stay sharp

03:05.560 --> 03:06.936
and duck 'em in the tunnels,

03:07.020 --> 03:08.646
these Maroni-Gigante-
Whatever-the-Fucks

03:08.730 --> 03:09.939
can sniff around all they want.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.608
They're so busy
with their noses up,

03:12.317 --> 03:14.069
they'll never think
to look down.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.320
But you and me...

03:15.403 --> 03:17.906
Look around.
Look at what we got, kid.

03:18.490 --> 03:21.618
The good people of Crown Point
hard at work, right?

03:21.701 --> 03:22.994
Protecting us.

03:23.078 --> 03:25.038
Keeping this whole fucking thing
quiet.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.082
We got their loyalty.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.125
And we got their love.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.168
You know why?

03:31.795 --> 03:32.754
'Cause we pay 'em.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.007
You know how meaningful
that is, Vic?

03:37.300 --> 03:38.510
To be the guy
in the neighborhood

03:38.593 --> 03:39.552
who takes care of people?

03:41.846 --> 03:44.099
They're gonna tell stories
about us one day, kid.

03:45.725 --> 03:46.976
You think?

03:47.060 --> 03:48.269
I fuckin' know it.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.478
Victor Aguilar.

03:51.523 --> 03:52.691
Oswald Cobb.

03:53.942 --> 03:54.776
Yeah.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.153
Our names
are gonna live forever.

04:19.591 --> 04:20.760
You're doing it again.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.433
You're scrutinizing.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.102
I'm admiring you.

04:30.562 --> 04:31.896
Are you hurt?

04:34.524 --> 04:35.650
I deserve it.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.412
Bored with me already?

04:47.495 --> 04:48.496
I have work.

04:53.752 --> 04:55.045
When you find Oz,

04:56.546 --> 04:58.965
feel free to take advantage
of my expertise.

05:01.509 --> 05:02.844
Dom will see you out.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.867
You know, fugitives really
shouldn't leave their rooms.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.595
I can't believe you opened that.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.972
What? It was just
gathering dust.

05:48.765 --> 05:49.933
Just like your father.

06:08.284 --> 06:09.494
Do you want this chopped?

06:10.245 --> 06:11.287
Sure.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.795
Leo spotted Oz's driver
delivering product

06:18.878 --> 06:20.088
in Sullivan territory.

06:20.588 --> 06:21.423
And lost him.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.758
Said he disappeared.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.385
Just like the others.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.303
Oz is a fucking weed.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.265
He likes the spotlight too much
to stay hidden.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.726
Don't use those.

06:38.857 --> 06:39.733
These are better.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.070
I wouldn't have pegged you
as a cook.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.655
Well...

06:45.739 --> 06:48.158
Nadia showed me
her family recipes.

06:50.326 --> 06:51.953
So I could pass 'em down.

06:54.164 --> 06:55.206
This is...

06:56.207 --> 06:57.876
khoresh bademjan.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.128
Eggplant, tomatoes,
a little meat.

07:01.671 --> 07:02.714
Taj...

07:03.923 --> 07:05.216
liked yogurt on his.

07:15.477 --> 07:16.603
Mangia.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.165
Taj was right.

07:38.707 --> 07:40.377
It is very good with the yogurt.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.547
"Taj was right."

07:56.518 --> 07:57.519
Okay.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.231
So the weed...

08:03.400 --> 08:05.110
The weed is sneaking around
the city

08:06.027 --> 08:07.070
without protection.

08:08.530 --> 08:10.323
He's supplying the street
with your drug.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.200
And no one's talking.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.829
If he gets more local gangs
on his side--

08:15.912 --> 08:16.913
No.

08:17.706 --> 08:20.125
He needs the Triads
to make waves,

08:20.207 --> 08:21.835
and they made a deal with me,
not Oz.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.170
Sofia, people buy
from whoever's selling.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.172
Oz got that tip from Carmine.

08:30.802 --> 08:31.803
Yeah.

08:32.721 --> 08:33.929
Stings, don't it?

08:37.017 --> 08:39.936
Well, then I think that we just
have to make it very clear

08:41.145 --> 08:43.690
that playing with Oz
comes at a cost.

09:08.298 --> 09:09.299
The fuck?

09:23.063 --> 09:24.189
Oswald?

09:26.733 --> 09:27.901
Oswald?

09:29.110 --> 09:30.695
The fuckin' heat's off.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.364
Yeah, Oz, power's out.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.366
-All right, I heard ya.
-My hands are freezing.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.201
Still smells fucking great,
though, huh?

09:36.284 --> 09:38.328
-Take a look.
-Cooked enough.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.750
Kinda reminds me
of Paulie's Diner.

09:43.875 --> 09:44.668
Don't it, Ma?

09:46.378 --> 09:47.921
If you're gonna keep me
cooped up in here

09:48.004 --> 09:49.297
like a goddamned POW,

09:49.381 --> 09:52.258
the least you could do
is let me listen to my music.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.678
Thank you, sweetheart.
You're a good boy.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.012
Ma.

09:56.888 --> 09:59.557
Yeah, well, Ma, we ain't gonna
be here much longer,

09:59.641 --> 10:01.601
not with all the cash
we got coming in.

10:01.685 --> 10:02.936
Ain't that right, Vic?

10:03.520 --> 10:05.146
-Vic!
-Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.731
Yeah. Big money.
Yeah. Good stuff.

10:07.524 --> 10:08.983
Ma, eat something. Come on.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.403
You gotta keep your strength up.
A little bit of food.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.656
Paulie's Diner, huh?

10:15.782 --> 10:18.243
Sticky, plastic menus.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.495
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.831
You remember. Yeah.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.667
They... They... They...

10:27.502 --> 10:29.045
-She ain't lyin'.
-They...

10:29.129 --> 10:30.714
So, listen, the local guys
you brought in,

10:30.797 --> 10:32.173
they're solid, they're tough.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.676
Anyone new,
they gotta have little hands.

10:34.759 --> 10:35.802
Did you say "little hands"?

10:35.885 --> 10:38.138
No, I'm fuckin' serious.
I mean, we can't have

10:38.221 --> 10:40.265
all these fat fingers
packing up our product.

10:40.348 --> 10:43.727
-Takes them twice as long.
-Okay. I got you.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.229
For Christ's sake, when are you
gonna do something, huh?

10:47.022 --> 10:48.648
Like it or not,
they're your boys.

10:48.732 --> 10:51.568
-They're fuckin' freezin'.
-Ma, what are you talkin' about?

10:51.651 --> 10:54.404
No! No! If you can't get
the heat back on,

10:54.487 --> 10:55.989
I'll go to Rex.
He'll get it done.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.532
Ma, hey. You're confused.
It's all right.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.034
Hey, you're just confused.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.494
I ain't Dad. All right?
Just snap out of it. Come on.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.788
Hey, you don't have to worry
about that, Francis, okay?

11:03.872 --> 11:05.749
-'Cause Jack...
-Jack?

11:05.832 --> 11:07.250
Jack went to pay the bill
downtown.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.377
-What are you doing?
-So that's all settled, okay?

11:09.461 --> 11:11.129
Electricity, that's gonna be
back on soon.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.839
Jack's downtown?
This whole time...

11:12.922 --> 11:14.924
-He's gonna get it figured out.
-...Jack's downtown.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.634
Stop it. You're making it worse.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.386
-I'm sorry. I thought--
-Hey, no, no.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.764
You don't talk about my brother.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.557
You ain't got no right,
you understand?

11:25.977 --> 11:28.021
Okay. Ma. Ma, look at me.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.023
Hey, Ma, look at me.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.232
I'm Oswald.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.109
I ain't Dad, all right?

11:33.193 --> 11:35.153
Jack and Rex, none of them
are here no more.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.782
It's just you and me.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.618
-You got it?
-Yes.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.535
-Link?
-Oz.

11:42.619 --> 11:45.038
What's good? Mr. Zhao ready
to put in or what?

11:45.121 --> 11:46.456
Answer the phone, why don't ya?

11:47.332 --> 11:48.333
Link.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.213
-Oswald.
-Huh?

11:53.296 --> 11:54.172
I know what's going on.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.674
Slow down. What the hell
you talking about?

11:55.757 --> 11:57.175
I'll take care of my music.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.677
Hey, pull up the news.

11:59.928 --> 12:00.887
Link, come on.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.347
You clean this shit up.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.974
I'll take care of myself. Watch.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.685
Nah, it can't be that bad.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.604
Fuck!

12:09.688 --> 12:10.647
Triads are out.

12:11.439 --> 12:12.524
Shit!

12:13.692 --> 12:15.527
Three bodies
have been found hanging.

12:15.610 --> 12:16.986
That's Sullivan territory.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.530
All appear to be young men,

12:18.613 --> 12:20.156
each of them
with a severed finger.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.866
The hanging and the pinky?

12:21.950 --> 12:23.868
Jesus, Sofia,
pick a fucking lane.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.204
Why these guys?
They're just the corner boys.

12:26.287 --> 12:27.747
It's a warning shot.

12:27.831 --> 12:29.541
Fuckin' Mork and Mindy
are flexing.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.418
It means anyone caught
with our product gets it.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.169
...string of murders
comes on the heels

12:33.253 --> 12:34.587
of the escape of Salvatore...

12:34.671 --> 12:35.964
None of those
lightweight assholes

12:36.047 --> 12:37.924
have the balls
or the muscle to fight back.

12:38.008 --> 12:40.093
...gas leak that left
many prominent members

12:40.176 --> 12:41.720
of the Falcone Family dead.

12:41.803 --> 12:44.389
This close to a deal
with the Triads.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.811
Now, I couldn't give Bliss away
if I fucking tried.

12:57.235 --> 12:58.278
Unless...

13:03.616 --> 13:04.868
What if I did?

13:06.494 --> 13:07.620
What if you what?

13:07.704 --> 13:09.247
What if I gave it the fuck away?

13:14.711 --> 13:16.254
Hey, everybody, listen up.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.506
I don't want anybody
to be shy tonight.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.967
You drop the product
in any diner, any bar,

13:21.051 --> 13:22.969
any fuckin' restaurant,
gas station.

13:23.053 --> 13:24.429
I don't give a fuck.

13:24.512 --> 13:27.474
Anybody who wants it gets it.
You understand? Anybody.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.642
-Yeah, got it.
-These gangs, they've gotta know

13:29.726 --> 13:31.770
that Bliss is in their hood

13:31.853 --> 13:33.688
whether they fuckin' like it
or not.

13:34.189 --> 13:37.942
Look, Sal, Sofia know my crew.
They ain't lookin' for you guys.

13:38.026 --> 13:39.319
But we don't take
anyone's money?

13:39.402 --> 13:40.904
Nah. That's the beauty of it,
Richie.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.864
It ain't about the money,
not tonight, anyway.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.407
We're creating demand.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.993
Gonna give every motherfucker
in this city a free taste.

13:47.077 --> 13:49.245
All right, no more
standing around! Come on!

13:49.329 --> 13:50.789
Let's go! Let's go!

13:50.872 --> 13:52.707
Gotta get this shit
on the streets.

14:01.299 --> 14:02.634
Hey, yo, Victor.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.260
What's good, man?
Where you been?

14:05.136 --> 14:06.096
Hey, Squid, what's up?

14:06.179 --> 14:08.264
Figured you had either bounced
or died.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.974
What are you doing
back in the Point?

14:10.642 --> 14:12.060
Run out of gas or something?

14:12.143 --> 14:13.728
Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh.

14:14.229 --> 14:15.772
Damn! You a sneakerhead now,
Victor?

14:16.356 --> 14:18.233
Nah, nah. These are...

14:18.316 --> 14:19.442
These are just B-grade.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.945
B-grade? Come on, man.
Don't do me like that.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.655
We go back, right?

14:23.738 --> 14:25.573
Come on. You think
I can't see that shit?

14:28.993 --> 14:30.995
Yo, where you gettin'
your money from, Victor?

14:31.746 --> 14:33.998
'Cause other people in the Point
are flush with cash too,

14:34.082 --> 14:35.750
but not from Drops.
That shit dried up.

14:35.792 --> 14:36.751
So what is it?

14:37.669 --> 14:39.671
Squid, I'm not a part
of any drug--

14:40.588 --> 14:42.173
What? Huh?

14:44.217 --> 14:46.594
Squid, I-I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

14:46.678 --> 14:49.097
Oh, come on, man.
Don't fuckin' bullshit me, man.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.890
What about that old lady
I saw you with

14:50.974 --> 14:52.642
up by Calvin's the other night?

14:52.726 --> 14:55.353
What's good with her?
I haven't seen her in a while.

14:55.437 --> 14:57.522
Maybe I'll go lookin' for her.
Is that what you want?

15:02.318 --> 15:04.571
Look, I'm offerin' you
my services, Victor.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.574
You want me on your side, right?

15:10.660 --> 15:12.495
So, go tell your people
I want in,

15:12.579 --> 15:14.330
and let's get
this motherfuckin' money.

15:15.874 --> 15:16.708
We cool?

15:19.044 --> 15:21.004
Yo, welcome back to the hood,
baby!

15:22.047 --> 15:23.882
Let's get this money, Victor!

15:50.742 --> 15:51.743
Damn it!

15:56.790 --> 15:58.458
We gotta find
someone he cares about.

15:58.917 --> 16:01.795
He doesn't.
It's his greatest asset.

16:15.809 --> 16:16.643
I know.

16:25.402 --> 16:26.903
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

16:27.612 --> 16:28.446
Who are they?

16:29.364 --> 16:30.323
His brothers.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.409
They died young.

16:33.034 --> 16:34.285
His mother is dead, too.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.996
I never heard much
about his father.

16:37.580 --> 16:38.665
So he's got nothing.

16:42.252 --> 16:44.254
He takes everything from me,

16:44.337 --> 16:45.755
and he's got nothing!

16:47.173 --> 16:48.425
Nothing!

16:51.386 --> 16:52.345
Practice your swing.

17:05.650 --> 17:06.526
Shit.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.281
Hey, Ma.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.159
Ma, you hungry?

17:59.954 --> 18:01.289
Oswald!

18:03.416 --> 18:04.626
Oswald!

18:04.668 --> 18:06.461
-Ma, you all right?
-Help!

18:09.130 --> 18:10.882
Don't look at me!
Don't look at me! Don't look!

18:10.965 --> 18:12.050
Jesus, Ma!

18:12.634 --> 18:14.052
Ah, don't look at me!

18:14.761 --> 18:15.845
Ma, what happened?

18:15.929 --> 18:17.639
-Just get me outta here.
-Come here.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.975
You all right? Ma.

18:21.059 --> 18:22.519
Ma, the water's
fucking freezing.

18:22.602 --> 18:23.645
How long you been in here?

18:24.187 --> 18:25.939
Come on. Come on. There you go.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.899
Up, up, up, up.

18:27.982 --> 18:28.942
There you go.

18:30.485 --> 18:31.444
All right.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.279
Jesus Christ!

18:33.905 --> 18:35.115
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.574
-Wait, wait, wait.
-Quick.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.703
We been at it all night.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.788
I shoulda checked on ya.

18:42.372 --> 18:43.206
I'm sorry.

18:46.251 --> 18:48.586
All right.
Okay, this leg. One leg.

18:49.504 --> 18:51.423
There you go. There you go.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.095
There you go.
All right, let's go.

18:57.178 --> 18:58.763
Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.

19:00.598 --> 19:02.100
All right. Come on. You got it.

19:03.601 --> 19:04.602
There you go.

19:05.186 --> 19:06.021
Come on.

19:13.695 --> 19:15.530
Please... I can't...

19:15.613 --> 19:17.949
-I can't do this.
-You're all right.

19:18.033 --> 19:19.868
Oswald, I can't do this.

19:19.951 --> 19:21.411
-I can't do this.
-Ma, listen to me.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.288
You're gonna be all right.
We just gotta--

19:23.371 --> 19:25.665
We just gotta get you warmed up.
That's all.

19:28.376 --> 19:29.461
This thing I got,

19:29.544 --> 19:31.880
it's a goddamn dirty thief.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.214
Just keeps taking.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.759
I can't do numbers no more.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.428
I'm seeing things
that ain't real.

19:39.471 --> 19:40.430
The boys...

19:40.972 --> 19:42.182
Sometimes, I see 'em.

19:44.142 --> 19:46.770
They look at me
like, like I ain't theirs.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.190
It breaks my goddamn heart.

19:50.940 --> 19:51.900
I know, Ma.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.195
I ain't gonna live
like a goddamn vegetable.

19:55.278 --> 19:56.780
I just ain't gonna do it.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.073
You understand?

19:58.156 --> 19:59.199
Yeah.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.452
No. What do you mean?

20:04.329 --> 20:07.207
If my mind goes
before my body's ready,

20:07.874 --> 20:11.169
I need you to help me.
You gotta help me die.

20:12.587 --> 20:13.672
Help you die?

20:13.755 --> 20:15.465
Jesus, Ma,
you ain't thinkin' straight.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.466
For now, I am.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.094
I won't be one
of those pathetic old broads,

20:19.177 --> 20:22.138
droolin', shittin' themselves,

20:22.722 --> 20:24.474
starin' out at nothin'

20:24.557 --> 20:26.768
with no clue what's going on,

20:26.851 --> 20:28.853
knowing just enough
to make it worse.

20:29.688 --> 20:32.190
If I lose my dignity,
what else I got, huh?

20:35.527 --> 20:37.320
-I can't do it.
-Sure, you can.

20:37.904 --> 20:38.905
Look at me, sweetheart.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.324
Oh, you'll be all right.

20:42.450 --> 20:43.535
I know you will.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.871
You're my brave boy.

20:51.626 --> 20:53.294
But you ain't a fuckin' dog.

20:56.131 --> 20:57.465
You're my ma. I mean...

20:58.591 --> 21:00.135
You're asking me
to do something...

21:00.927 --> 21:02.095
-It ain't natural.
-No!

21:03.888 --> 21:05.932
No! Don't you pussy out
on me, Oswald.

21:06.016 --> 21:06.975
I swear to God.

21:07.726 --> 21:10.437
I have given you everything.
I have given you everything.

21:10.520 --> 21:11.604
Yeah, you have.

21:12.522 --> 21:14.357
Say you'll do it. And mean it.

21:15.108 --> 21:16.276
'Cause you love me.

21:17.152 --> 21:17.986
Say it.

21:20.488 --> 21:21.322
Say it.

21:24.826 --> 21:25.660
All right.

21:29.039 --> 21:29.914
I'll do it.

21:31.875 --> 21:33.293
Good.

21:33.376 --> 21:34.210
All right?

21:37.339 --> 21:38.590
Good.

21:38.673 --> 21:41.009
Come on, let's get you dressed.
Come on.

21:42.844 --> 21:44.095
On the count of three, okay?

21:44.679 --> 21:46.890
-One, two, three.
-Three.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.309
Oswald.

22:33.061 --> 22:34.437
You look gorgeous, Ma.

22:36.356 --> 22:37.190
Powerful.

22:39.150 --> 22:40.151
Like Gilda.

22:58.003 --> 22:59.129
Hey.

22:59.212 --> 23:00.088
Hey.

23:04.843 --> 23:06.469
Rest of the drops went smooth.

23:07.512 --> 23:11.307
Bliss is all over the streets.
You, uh, h-hear anything yet?

23:11.850 --> 23:12.767
Nah.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.735
There's something...

23:23.278 --> 23:26.072
We maybe got a... problem.

23:29.826 --> 23:34.039
There's this guy
f-f-from the neighborhood.

23:35.040 --> 23:36.416
Everybody calls him Squid.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.836
He's the guy
that I boosted your rims for.

23:43.089 --> 23:46.051
Well, look, I th-thought
I could avoid him, but...

23:47.510 --> 23:48.386
he's on me.

23:49.512 --> 23:53.892
A-asking questions
about us, and...

23:56.394 --> 23:57.854
I don't think he's gonna stop.

23:59.981 --> 24:01.399
This fuckin' thing.

24:08.656 --> 24:09.866
It's cold in here, right?

24:11.076 --> 24:13.453
It's too fuckin' cold for Ma.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.125
You know, they don't even know
what she's got.

24:22.212 --> 24:24.339
First, it was Parkinson's.
Then Alzheimer's.

24:24.422 --> 24:27.175
And now, they're talking
about some fuckin' thing

24:27.258 --> 24:29.469
called Lewy body.
What the fuck is that, huh?

24:32.013 --> 24:33.515
You know,
all these fuckin' geniuses,

24:33.598 --> 24:35.642
they got the diplomas
and machines.

24:35.725 --> 24:37.018
They don't even fuckin' know.

24:37.727 --> 24:40.438
How am I supposed to protect her
from something like that?

24:43.024 --> 24:44.818
Y-you're doing
the best you can, though.

24:44.901 --> 24:46.403
She knows that.

24:46.486 --> 24:49.239
It's a good thing
that she's here with you.

24:50.740 --> 24:52.075
What you were saying before...

24:54.786 --> 24:55.662
We got a problem?

24:57.247 --> 24:58.456
No.

24:58.540 --> 24:59.916
No, no. I'm good.

25:00.542 --> 25:01.543
-You sure?
-Yep.

25:04.462 --> 25:05.463
Look at that.

25:06.881 --> 25:08.758
City Hall shinin' bright.

25:16.808 --> 25:17.809
Keep an eye out.

25:18.643 --> 25:19.519
All right?

25:20.061 --> 25:21.021
Mm-hmm.

25:25.692 --> 25:26.943
Her name's Eve.

25:29.988 --> 25:32.866
-Sorry. Never seen her.
-No.

25:34.034 --> 25:34.993
You sure about that?

25:35.493 --> 25:37.078
Never seen the bitch.

25:44.419 --> 25:47.005
You're a real buzzkill
around here, you know?

25:50.800 --> 25:51.885
Roxy.

25:53.053 --> 25:54.471
We met at Apex.

25:55.138 --> 25:56.264
Doubt you remember.

25:57.974 --> 26:00.268
But I might be able to help.

26:01.478 --> 26:02.896
For the right price.

26:09.069 --> 26:10.362
Appreciate your time,
Councilman.

26:10.445 --> 26:12.405
Anything for the GCPD.

26:12.489 --> 26:13.573
These days especially,

26:13.656 --> 26:15.367
we need to look out
for one another.

26:19.996 --> 26:21.081
See you next week.

26:21.164 --> 26:22.290
Good night, guys.

26:24.834 --> 26:27.420
Come on! Who is this asshole?

26:27.962 --> 26:29.047
Clunker.

26:30.131 --> 26:31.132
Councilman Hady.

26:34.135 --> 26:35.178
Carmine's guy.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.972
I wrote you a note, you know.
You never responded.

26:38.890 --> 26:40.558
You don't wanna be pals with me?

26:41.142 --> 26:43.645
Kinda, you know,
hurts my feelings.

26:44.396 --> 26:45.855
Listen, I paid off my debts.

26:45.939 --> 26:47.232
Yeah, yeah. To Carmine.

26:47.816 --> 26:48.733
Not to me.

26:49.818 --> 26:50.735
Okay.

26:51.778 --> 26:54.155
"Okay"? What,
you think I don't matter?

26:54.239 --> 26:56.032
That it?
Then you don't mind too much

26:56.116 --> 26:58.535
if I introduce myself
to some of your crooked friends?

26:58.618 --> 26:59.661
-Huh? Huh?
-Hey.

26:59.744 --> 27:00.829
Come here. Come here.

27:00.912 --> 27:03.039
-Come here.
-Stop! Stop!

27:03.123 --> 27:05.166
Or maybe I just talk
to the Gazette?

27:05.250 --> 27:06.334
I bet they'd love to see

27:06.418 --> 27:08.461
how you paid your gambling debts
with city funds.

27:09.421 --> 27:11.631
You think you can just raw dog
the people of Gotham

27:11.715 --> 27:13.091
with an invisible dick? That it?

27:13.174 --> 27:15.802
Shit! Shit! What do you want?

27:15.885 --> 27:17.804
I want you to do
your fuckin' job.

27:17.887 --> 27:19.389
That's what I fuckin' want.

27:20.724 --> 27:22.600
City's diverting power
from Crown Point.

27:22.684 --> 27:24.894
Families are living in the dark.
They're freezing.

27:25.520 --> 27:27.689
Meanwhile, you go home
to your warm fuckpad mansion.

27:27.772 --> 27:29.274
It ain't right.

27:29.774 --> 27:31.234
So you're gonna get
the power on in Crown Point.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.069
You know how much red tape and--

27:34.738 --> 27:36.406
Please stop!
I'll do it! I'll do it!

27:36.489 --> 27:37.782
Please stop! Fuck!

27:38.408 --> 27:40.118
-Please stop! Fuck!
-All right. All right.

27:40.869 --> 27:42.829
Hey, hey. It's just your nose.

27:42.912 --> 27:44.497
Fuckin' hell. Give me your tie.

27:45.790 --> 27:46.624
Listen to me.

27:47.292 --> 27:48.501
You got till sunup.

27:49.252 --> 27:51.296
And I ain't someone's guy.
My name's Oswald Cobb.

27:52.339 --> 27:53.757
Next time, you won't forget.

27:54.799 --> 27:55.842
Get the fuck outta here.

28:02.682 --> 28:03.892
Jesus! Come on.

28:03.975 --> 28:05.310
You got more room
than you think.

28:05.393 --> 28:06.394
Straight back.

28:11.191 --> 28:12.192
Christ.

28:13.985 --> 28:15.487
Donny Boy, glad you called.

28:15.570 --> 28:16.905
What the fuck
you think you're doing

28:16.988 --> 28:18.656
dumping your product
in my territory?

28:18.740 --> 28:20.450
The fuck you talking about?
We had a deal.

28:20.533 --> 28:22.160
You turned your back.
What do you expect?

28:22.243 --> 28:23.995
Fuck you!
They murdered my boys.

28:24.079 --> 28:26.331
-Put them on display...
-I ain't talkin' to you when--

28:26.414 --> 28:28.416
I ain't talkin' to you
when you're like this.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.251
Let's get together. We'll...

28:30.335 --> 28:31.836
We'll figure it out
face-to-face.

28:32.587 --> 28:34.464
-I know somewhere.
-Don't fuck with the Sullivans.

28:34.547 --> 28:35.965
I'm gonna text you the address.

28:43.556 --> 28:44.557
Yo, Victor.

28:45.517 --> 28:47.394
Freezin' my fuckin' dick off
out here.

28:48.103 --> 28:49.187
Where your people at?

28:50.772 --> 28:52.607
Right. So that's actually...

28:53.942 --> 28:55.443
what I wanted
to talk to you about.

28:57.278 --> 28:59.698
Look, man, I tried.
Okay? They're just not...

28:59.781 --> 29:03.118
They're not looking
for... more guys right now.

29:03.201 --> 29:05.537
But... Look.

29:07.330 --> 29:09.582
I know this is
your neighborhood, right?

29:10.542 --> 29:13.962
They know that, respect that,
respect you, so...

29:16.756 --> 29:17.632
Yeah.

29:20.051 --> 29:21.928
And look, man,
I can get you more next week.

29:22.012 --> 29:23.513
And-and...

29:24.597 --> 29:26.182
as soon as something opens up,

29:27.017 --> 29:27.851
you know?

29:28.435 --> 29:29.436
We just gotta...

29:30.478 --> 29:32.272
pump the brakes
and-and-and take things slow.

29:32.355 --> 29:33.982
But you can get me more
next week?

29:35.316 --> 29:37.277
-Right, yeah.
-'Cause I'm already running low.

29:37.986 --> 29:39.821
Shit's crazy. It's going fast.

29:41.197 --> 29:42.449
What, you think you big, Victor?

29:43.491 --> 29:45.827
Think you can pay me off? Huh?

29:45.910 --> 29:48.413
You just a kid from the Bricks
who can't even steal some rims

29:48.496 --> 29:49.998
thinkin' he's big-time tough guy

29:50.081 --> 29:52.375
'cause he's working
with Oz what's-his-fuck.

29:52.500 --> 29:55.128
Yeah, the Wizard of fuckin' Oz.
Nobody sees this guy,

29:55.211 --> 29:57.255
but he's out here
pullin' all these strings.

29:58.381 --> 29:59.424
The word on the street is

29:59.507 --> 30:00.800
he's running that new drug,
Bliss,

30:00.884 --> 30:02.927
and a bunch of heavy-hitters
are lookin' for him.

30:03.011 --> 30:05.555
Maybe I should help them out,
make some real money.

30:07.891 --> 30:09.351
Or you take me to your boss.

30:10.477 --> 30:12.145
So what's it gonna be, Victor?

30:13.646 --> 30:14.481
Squid,

30:15.357 --> 30:16.232
Oz...

30:17.108 --> 30:18.360
he'll kill you.

30:18.443 --> 30:20.862
Yeah? Take me
to that motherfucker right now.

30:20.945 --> 30:22.947
-You think I'm playing with you?
-All right. Okay.

30:23.031 --> 30:25.241
All right. Yeah. Okay.

30:31.456 --> 30:32.707
Yo, lead the way.

30:35.001 --> 30:36.002
We're this way.

30:37.879 --> 30:40.632
See? You a man now, Victor.

30:40.715 --> 30:42.592
Don't gotta make it
so hard on yourself.

30:44.552 --> 30:45.512
Look, Squid, he's...

30:46.554 --> 30:49.307
he's not even gonna be-be back
for another few hours.

30:49.391 --> 30:52.018
That's good with me. I'll wait.

30:59.442 --> 31:01.903
Okay, we're underground.

31:01.986 --> 31:02.946
Underground?

31:03.029 --> 31:04.572
Shit, you diggin' holes
or something?

31:17.961 --> 31:20.213
Oh. Fuck.

31:23.967 --> 31:25.593
Oh, my God.

31:33.893 --> 31:35.812
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

31:38.314 --> 31:39.733
Why'd you make me do that?

31:40.400 --> 31:41.693
You fuck!

32:06.009 --> 32:06.843
Hey.

32:10.555 --> 32:12.557
What? Didn't recognize me?

32:24.736 --> 32:26.696
You don't seem surprised
to see me.

32:26.780 --> 32:28.740
I told Roxy to send you up.

32:29.741 --> 32:31.034
Save us both a headache.

32:31.993 --> 32:33.161
Easy money, too.

32:36.122 --> 32:37.123
Drink?

32:44.381 --> 32:45.548
Where is he?

32:45.632 --> 32:48.426
He'd never tell someone like me
something like that.

32:49.552 --> 32:51.513
You know Oz as well as I do.

33:11.032 --> 33:12.075
Dressing like this...

33:13.493 --> 33:14.994
is this for you or your clients?

33:15.662 --> 33:18.373
Depends on the situation.

33:20.333 --> 33:22.252
Oz ever seen
this version of you?

33:23.294 --> 33:25.296
Couple of times.
He doesn't like it.

33:27.090 --> 33:28.466
What does he like?

33:31.928 --> 33:34.097
He's not that complicated.

33:36.224 --> 33:37.225
So...

33:39.561 --> 33:40.562
he's...

33:41.521 --> 33:44.607
the best you've ever had.

33:46.484 --> 33:47.485
What else?

33:48.653 --> 33:49.612
He's...

33:50.697 --> 33:53.408
destined for greatness.

33:58.621 --> 34:00.373
I used to lie to men like that.

34:02.125 --> 34:03.960
But you don't have to anymore.

34:06.504 --> 34:08.214
You have the power now.

34:10.050 --> 34:12.635
You are good at telling people
what they wanna hear.

34:22.270 --> 34:24.813
You have a drawer at his place.

34:26.940 --> 34:28.485
You mean something to him.

34:29.110 --> 34:31.529
He won't come for me,
if that's your plan.

34:32.781 --> 34:34.908
Not that kind of relationship.
Okay.

34:36.743 --> 34:37.744
What is it then?

34:40.914 --> 34:42.791
He pays you, I presume, so...

34:43.708 --> 34:44.708
can't be love.

34:45.460 --> 34:47.003
Must be nice.

34:47.087 --> 34:49.130
You were born into opportunity,
honey,

34:49.214 --> 34:52.592
so you can afford
to think in black and white.

34:54.094 --> 34:57.639
What I got with Oz,
it ain't just one thing.

34:58.473 --> 35:00.016
I know what he is...

35:02.602 --> 35:04.896
a liar, narcissist...

35:06.064 --> 35:07.065
killer.

35:11.027 --> 35:12.654
But we all got our shit,
don't we?

35:12.737 --> 35:14.280
I mean, you certainly got yours.

35:17.701 --> 35:19.452
Nancy Hoffman...

35:20.453 --> 35:22.580
Yolanda Jones...

35:23.123 --> 35:24.749
those women meant nothing
to you.

35:25.917 --> 35:27.293
They were family to me.

35:29.504 --> 35:30.755
You still think I'm the Hangman?

35:34.884 --> 35:36.177
He never told you?

35:40.265 --> 35:41.808
My father killed those women.

35:44.394 --> 35:45.562
Killed my mother.

35:46.730 --> 35:47.731
Oz knew.

35:48.857 --> 35:50.191
He has always known.

35:51.192 --> 35:53.236
Well, he helped cover it up

35:53.319 --> 35:55.488
so that my father
could keep on killing women.

35:57.782 --> 35:58.742
He used me.

36:00.326 --> 36:02.162
He let me rot in Arkham,

36:03.288 --> 36:04.289
so he could move up.

36:09.044 --> 36:11.004
Kept you in the dark
about all that, huh?

36:13.214 --> 36:14.924
Well, I guess if he hadn't,

36:15.008 --> 36:17.844
you'd have asked questions
about him.

36:17.927 --> 36:20.055
How he knows?

36:20.138 --> 36:24.976
Why he would work for a man
that murdered your friends?

36:25.685 --> 36:27.103
Oz would never risk that.

36:28.730 --> 36:30.023
It's better for him...

36:32.275 --> 36:34.652
isn't it, if you fear me?

36:35.236 --> 36:37.864
He said he felt bad for you,
that you were sick.

36:37.947 --> 36:40.408
If that were true, you would've
been dead at the door.

36:41.451 --> 36:43.745
But you did come here
to kill me, right?

36:44.746 --> 36:46.831
I mean, after all
is said and done?

36:51.628 --> 36:52.921
You were his alibi.

36:54.130 --> 36:55.215
You knew.

36:56.383 --> 36:57.801
Not at first.

36:59.010 --> 37:00.178
But yeah.

37:07.852 --> 37:11.106
So, when you're done here,

37:12.273 --> 37:14.317
just leave my girls alone, okay?

37:14.818 --> 37:16.403
That's why you asked me here?

37:19.698 --> 37:20.907
To save them.

37:21.491 --> 37:22.659
From the Hangman.

37:23.952 --> 37:25.662
But that's not
who you are, right?

37:36.756 --> 37:38.425
Your people protected you.

37:40.176 --> 37:41.428
They wouldn't give you up.

37:42.887 --> 37:44.097
Cuts both ways.

37:46.975 --> 37:48.143
They got my back.

37:48.977 --> 37:50.228
I got theirs.

38:02.407 --> 38:04.451
Well, whatever I was born into,

38:07.120 --> 38:08.371
I'll never have that.

38:19.466 --> 38:21.009
Crown Point.

38:24.262 --> 38:25.889
By the Zoo.

38:35.690 --> 38:37.150
You deserve your shot.

38:40.612 --> 38:42.781
But where you got
that information...

38:44.657 --> 38:45.909
It'll stay between us.

39:08.181 --> 39:09.140
Careful, fellas.

39:10.058 --> 39:12.977
Don't want this spillin'.
It'll ruin the surprise.

39:13.061 --> 39:15.188
Nick, you're driving.
Bruno, I need you to hang back,

39:15.271 --> 39:16.773
make sure
everything runs smoothly here.

39:16.856 --> 39:18.316
Whatever happens tonight,
fellas,

39:19.317 --> 39:20.318
we gotta be ready.

39:21.277 --> 39:24.406
Vic, where you been?
Phone's been blowing up nonstop.

39:25.407 --> 39:27.409
Motherfuckers are pissed,
but they wanna meet.

39:27.909 --> 39:28.910
This is it.

39:31.746 --> 39:32.747
You good?

39:38.503 --> 39:39.504
What's up with you?

39:42.090 --> 39:43.091
Something with that guy?

39:49.723 --> 39:51.057
You get away clean?

39:53.893 --> 39:55.061
I think so, yeah.

39:56.479 --> 39:58.356
Don't look down. Meet me here.

40:01.735 --> 40:03.153
You done the right thing.

40:04.404 --> 40:06.031
Protected those you care about.

40:08.908 --> 40:10.160
You're strong, kid.

40:20.545 --> 40:21.671
It gets easier.

40:29.179 --> 40:30.513
I want you home tonight.

40:33.391 --> 40:34.517
Dump those clothes.

40:36.019 --> 40:37.479
All right? Clean yourself up.

40:38.313 --> 40:40.732
Get something to eat and rest,
all right?

40:40.815 --> 40:43.026
Or you're gonna be
a puddle of water tomorrow.

40:43.109 --> 40:45.195
I'm gonna need you. You hear me?

40:46.404 --> 40:47.238
Yeah?

40:48.656 --> 40:49.532
All right.

41:22.190 --> 41:23.149
Well, well, well...

41:23.733 --> 41:25.235
Late to my own party.

41:25.318 --> 41:26.528
It's not a good look, I know.

41:30.365 --> 41:32.158
I got a little surprise
for you here.

41:35.161 --> 41:38.164
What I'm bringing you tonight
is big, bigger than Bliss.

41:38.248 --> 41:42.043
It's gonna change the face
of the whole city forever.

41:44.087 --> 41:47.924
And... it's my gift
to all of ya.

41:51.094 --> 41:52.387
This a fuckin' joke?

41:52.470 --> 41:55.181
Relax, Able.
Have a fuckin' beer. Jesus.

41:56.141 --> 41:57.726
You vouched for this man?

41:57.809 --> 41:59.269
That's right, Zhao, he did.

42:00.353 --> 42:01.855
And you're gonna thank him
for it.

42:02.897 --> 42:05.900
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Gold Summit.

42:06.651 --> 42:08.445
You'll be proud
to say you were here tonight,

42:08.528 --> 42:09.529
all of you...

42:10.113 --> 42:12.449
even though I know you hate
each other's friggin' guts.

42:12.532 --> 42:15.744
The shit between the Massive
and Odessa is legendary.

42:15.827 --> 42:17.829
LoBoys, you gotta scrap
with everyone

42:17.912 --> 42:19.247
just to get a bit of respect.

42:19.330 --> 42:23.293
Got the Triads.
Sullivans, oldest crew in town.

42:23.376 --> 42:25.795
But the most hated
here among us...

42:27.464 --> 42:29.507
is yours truly,
and not for nothin'.

42:29.591 --> 42:32.385
I got three of my guys strung up
'cause of you.

42:32.469 --> 42:34.721
No, not 'cause of me.

42:35.430 --> 42:37.182
They're dead
because the Maronis and Gigantes

42:37.265 --> 42:38.516
got the power to take you out.

42:38.600 --> 42:41.144
You want revenge?
What the fuck is stoppin' ya?

42:41.227 --> 42:42.562
They're right over there...

42:43.646 --> 42:45.315
across the Elliot Bridge.

42:45.982 --> 42:48.860
A bridge that was built
by your ancestors, Donny Boy,

42:48.943 --> 42:50.904
but it ain't named Sullivan.
Huh?

42:50.987 --> 42:52.822
No, it's named
for the rich crooks

42:52.906 --> 42:55.033
who took credit
for your family's hard work.

42:56.076 --> 42:58.328
They run shit. We eat shit.

42:58.411 --> 43:00.246
The sad thing, Donny Boy, is

43:01.039 --> 43:03.458
they don't even know
your fuckin' name!

43:06.711 --> 43:08.213
They don't know none of youse.

43:08.296 --> 43:09.631
But I do.

43:09.714 --> 43:11.299
Sal... Give me a fuckin' break.

43:11.383 --> 43:13.885
You know Sal bitches and moans

43:13.968 --> 43:16.346
about Carmine stealin'
his Drops business?

43:17.222 --> 43:20.058
What do you think him and Sofia
are gonna do to you, huh?

43:20.642 --> 43:23.353
They'll take your shit,
your territories.

43:23.436 --> 43:24.688
That's what's comin'.

43:25.689 --> 43:27.065
'Cause you mean nothin' to 'em.

43:27.691 --> 43:29.442
They don't give a fuck
about any of you all.

43:30.318 --> 43:31.945
You know,
not even a mile from here,

43:32.654 --> 43:35.323
there's a bunch of big-time,
City Hall fucks.

43:35.407 --> 43:37.242
They're sittin'
in some fancy private club.

43:37.325 --> 43:38.535
They're drinkin' orange wine.

43:38.618 --> 43:40.995
They're makin' crooked deals
to benefit them.

43:42.038 --> 43:44.582
And guess what? They can't
fuckin' stand each other either,

43:44.666 --> 43:45.750
just like you.

43:46.292 --> 43:47.919
But they're breakin' bread
because they know

43:48.003 --> 43:50.338
that each of them on their own,
they ain't got nothin',

43:50.422 --> 43:52.382
but together,
those soft-bellied pricks,

43:52.465 --> 43:54.175
they run
this whole fuckin' city.

43:55.093 --> 43:56.678
Why the hell not us?

43:58.263 --> 43:59.973
Now, I'm bringing you Bliss.

44:00.056 --> 44:02.142
Yeah, sure,
that gives us the extra leg.

44:02.892 --> 44:06.354
But the real power comes
if we've got each other's backs.

44:07.480 --> 44:09.941
Then Sal, Sofia, the old guard,

44:10.025 --> 44:11.735
they won't be able
to fuckin' touch us.

44:11.818 --> 44:13.194
This man's a fool.

44:13.278 --> 44:15.405
He betrays everyone
he works with.

44:15.947 --> 44:17.323
Sofia Gigante,

44:18.533 --> 44:19.826
Alberto Falcone.

44:20.869 --> 44:22.954
There's no code, no class.

44:23.038 --> 44:25.331
The Penguin is
a bargain-basement hustler.

44:26.666 --> 44:28.626
He'll do anything, say anything,

44:28.710 --> 44:30.378
and everyone here knows it.

44:30.462 --> 44:31.963
Do they, Zhao?

44:33.506 --> 44:35.091
'Cause here's what I know.

44:35.175 --> 44:38.178
Between us, we got
more territory, more manpower

44:38.261 --> 44:39.679
than this city's ever seen.

44:40.388 --> 44:42.432
You wanna blow that away?
Shit, go ahead.

44:42.515 --> 44:44.726
But I do got a fuckin' code!

44:47.145 --> 44:49.606
And I'm puttin' my goddamn life
on the line to share it with ya.

44:49.689 --> 44:52.108
If we come together
right here, right now,

44:53.443 --> 44:55.445
they're gonna talk
about this night...

44:57.280 --> 44:58.490
the time that we decided

44:58.573 --> 45:00.950
that it's better to work
with the ones we hate

45:01.034 --> 45:01.951
than live under those

45:02.035 --> 45:04.662
that don't even know
our fuckin' names!

45:14.381 --> 45:15.423
Nick, give me a beer.

45:26.017 --> 45:27.769
Look, everything you heard
about me...

45:28.687 --> 45:30.063
is true, you know?

45:30.647 --> 45:32.524
I stole Sofia's product. I...

45:34.067 --> 45:35.652
I popped Alberto Falcone.

45:37.362 --> 45:38.363
I did it all.

45:39.656 --> 45:40.824
So fuckin' what?

45:44.077 --> 45:45.286
I hustle.

45:45.370 --> 45:46.371
You know, I...

45:48.289 --> 45:49.457
do what it takes.

45:51.668 --> 45:54.295
'Cause at the end of the day,
you know...

45:57.882 --> 46:00.427
I'm just a poor kid
from the Eastside

46:00.510 --> 46:02.012
who's got something
to fuckin' prove.

46:03.638 --> 46:04.639
Like all of ya.

47:00.070 --> 47:01.446
To taking back Gotham!

47:30.517 --> 47:33.728
Oswald! Oswald!

47:34.938 --> 47:36.690
What's happening?
What's going on?

47:36.773 --> 47:38.942
Hey, Francis,
the... power's back on.

47:39.025 --> 47:40.485
-Hold on.
-What time is it?

47:40.568 --> 47:43.530
-How do I--
-No, no, no, no. Leave it on.

47:45.323 --> 47:46.616
I love this song.

47:57.585 --> 47:58.586
Whoa.

48:00.463 --> 48:01.464
Whoa.

48:07.929 --> 48:10.056
Dance with me, Benny.

48:11.808 --> 48:12.934
You remember.

48:13.560 --> 48:15.311
Don't be shy, sweetheart.
Come here.

48:19.774 --> 48:20.817
You're my biscuit.

48:22.152 --> 48:23.403
Yeah. Yeah.

48:34.247 --> 48:38.168
One, two. One, two. One, two.
One, two. One, two.

48:38.209 --> 48:39.836
One, two. One, two.

48:53.933 --> 48:54.934
He did it.

48:55.977 --> 48:58.855
Oz got the power back on.

48:59.814 --> 49:01.024
Oswald did this?

49:02.150 --> 49:03.234
For you.

49:04.194 --> 49:06.237
He did it for you.

49:18.375 --> 49:19.292
Oswald.

49:20.585 --> 49:23.922
My boy! You did it!

49:24.589 --> 49:25.715
My boy!

49:26.508 --> 49:27.467
Oswald!
