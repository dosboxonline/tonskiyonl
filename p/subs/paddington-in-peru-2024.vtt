you need to start embracing it!

11:42.833 --> 11:44.666
Oh, Paddington.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.666
She must really be missing you.

11:46.791 --> 11:52.333
I can't bear to think of her feeling lonely
after all she's done for me.

11:52.458 --> 11:54.916
- What can we do?
- There's not much we can do.

11:55.708 --> 11:58.791
It's not as if we can drop everything
and fly to Peru!

12:02.041 --> 12:03.875
Now, I-I know that look, Mary...

12:04.000 --> 12:06.458
It's the perfect idea.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.750
Aunt Lucy's missing Paddington.

12:08.875 --> 12:12.750
He's just got his passport. This family
needs to spend some time together.

12:12.875 --> 12:13.875
Does it?

12:15.208 --> 12:16.625
Yes! Let's do it!

12:16.750 --> 12:17.750
A trip to Peru!

12:17.875 --> 12:20.375
A family holiday in Peru.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.375
- Peru? Just like that?
- Yes!

12:22.500 --> 12:25.416
Land of altitude sickness
and uncharted jungles.

12:25.541 --> 12:30.416
Plus three of the world's most
dangerous roads, well, at least on a Harley.

12:31.708 --> 12:37.125
Precisely! From a risk assessment
point of view Peru is...

12:38.666 --> 12:41.125
'Embrace the risk, Henry.'

12:44.875 --> 12:46.875
...exactly where we should be going.

12:47.625 --> 12:51.583
Yes! Yes, it is!
Oh, Paddington, this is so exciting.

12:51.708 --> 12:53.875

(Mr Gruber) Paddington in Peru, eh?
When are you off?

12:58.541 --> 13:00.083
First thing tomorrow.

13:00.208 --> 13:04.208
I can't wait to see Aunt Lucy
and try this out, of course.

13:05.833 --> 13:07.666
Mmm...

13:07.791 --> 13:09.958
I'm officially British, you know.

13:10.416 --> 13:14.041
And not before time.
We are very lucky to have you, Mr Brown.

13:15.208 --> 13:19.541
That reminds me,
I have something for Judy for your trip.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.666

on "Zeppelin Travel".

13:55.958 --> 13:59.875
Mr Brown?
Have you been seeing a ghost?

14:00.000 --> 14:03.875
Mr Gruber, that statue...
What is it?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.666
Ah, you've noticed my Peruvian collection.

14:06.791 --> 14:11.041
It just... roared.
Like it was speaking to me.

14:12.458 --> 14:16.041
Things from my homeland
speak to me all the time.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.458
It was very strange, Mr Gruber.

14:18.583 --> 14:22.875
Mr Brown, you know,
becoming a citizen of another country,

14:23.000 --> 14:30.791
while a wonderful thing,
can lead to... well, mixed feelings.

14:30.916 --> 14:36.750
Oh, not me, Mr Gruber.
My feelings are very much unmixed.

- Oh...

18:52.541 --> 18:54.208
Aunt Lucy?

18:54.333 --> 18:55.791
Oh! Hello?

18:55.916 --> 18:57.958
(All) Hello.

18:58.083 --> 18:59.708
Please could you tell me the way
to Aunt Lucy's cabin?

19:00.208 --> 19:03.541
- Yes, it's that way, but I...
- Thank you.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.166
Aunt Lucy!

19:07.000 --> 19:09.250
Aunt Lucy, it's me!

19:11.250 --> 19:12.583
Aunt Lucy?

19:15.250 --> 19:16.916
Aunt Lucy?

19:18.208 --> 19:19.625
Paddington...

19:20.083 --> 19:22.541
Missing? Whatever do you mean?

19:22.666 --> 19:24.750
She's gone, and we have no idea
where she is.

19:24.875 --> 19:26.125
What do you mean "gone"?

19:26.250 --> 19:30.250
Well, she seems to have set off
on some sort of quest into the jungle.

19:30.375 --> 19:32.625
Now? But she knew we were coming.

19:32.750 --> 19:34.583
Well, that's what's so mysterious.

19:34.708 --> 19:39.250
She was so excited to see you,
counting down the days to your arrival.

19:39.375 --> 19:42.708
But I'm... I'm afraid to say
that since I wrote,

19:42.833 --> 19:45.375
your aunt's behaviour
has become even more worrying.

19:47.541 --> 19:50.458
'She seemed to have been
researching something.'

19:54.250 --> 19:56.250
Whatever it was,
she was obsessed with it.

19:56.375 --> 19:58.583
I mean, very secretive
about the whole thing.

19:59.250 --> 20:01.416
'And then we went to check on her...'

20:07.000 --> 20:08.041
...and she wasn't there.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.500
This isn't like Aunt Lucy.

20:10.625 --> 20:13.875
Something's wrong.
We need to send out a search party!

20:14.000 --> 20:16.833
Well, we already did, my dear.

20:19.458 --> 20:23.208
I'm afraid all they found were these,
washed down the river.

20:26.458 --> 20:28.291
Aunt Lucy's special bracelet.

20:28.416 --> 20:30.583
She'd never take this off, un...

20:31.500 --> 20:32.500
...unless...

20:33.000 --> 20:34.708
(Gasps)

20:36.458 --> 20:38.208
Broken.

20:38.333 --> 20:39.500
Paddington...

20:39.625 --> 20:42.291
I don't know what's happened to her,
Mrs Brown...

20:43.000 --> 20:45.958
...but she may be hurt, or in trouble.

20:46.083 --> 20:50.041
And she can't see without her glasses
and... I have to find her.

20:51.250 --> 20:56.791
Well, Paddington, I hate to say this,
but the Amazon is quite...

21:04.458 --> 21:06.458
...large.

21:09.125 --> 21:11.583
- Paddington...
- We have to try.

21:11.708 --> 21:14.000
Aunt Lucy would never give up on me.

21:14.125 --> 21:17.041
Alas, there's nothing any of us
can do tonight.

21:17.166 --> 21:19.750
And you must be very tired
after your journey.

21:19.875 --> 21:22.041
- The nuns will show you your rooms.
- Thank you.

21:22.166 --> 21:23.583
(Mrs Brown) Thank you so much.

21:29.208 --> 21:30.833
(Paddington) Hmm...

21:31.708 --> 21:36.500
All it takes to light the darkness
is one candle of faith.

21:39.875 --> 21:41.416
Something will turn up.

21:48.166 --> 21:52.000
Where are you, Aunt Lucy?
What were you looking for?

21:54.541 --> 21:58.958
If only you had left me
some sort of... clue.

22:03.875 --> 22:06.208
Oh, my goodness!
This must be it!

22:06.333 --> 22:08.708
- (Creaking)
- This floorboard's loose.

22:08.833 --> 22:11.833
Perhaps there's a secret compartment
or...

22:13.125 --> 22:15.083
Oh! Ooh!

22:16.166 --> 22:17.416
Mmm?

22:23.000 --> 22:24.083
Huh?

22:24.791 --> 22:27.250
(Mr Brown) Yes, I'd like to report
a missing bear, please.

22:27.375 --> 22:31.625
Brown eyes, brown fur...
Well, in fact, just brown.

22:33.208 --> 22:37.541
Yes, we've lost a jungle bear
in... in the jungle.

22:37.666 --> 22:40.000
I-I'm not sure
I like your tone of voice.

22:40.458 --> 22:41.666
And a good day to you too, sir.

22:46.041 --> 22:47.208
- Morning.
- Morning.

22:47.333 --> 22:48.583
Any luck with the police?

22:48.708 --> 22:51.875
Apparently "too busy
looking for lost fish in the river".

22:52.000 --> 22:58.625
It does seem odd, Aunt Lucy just leaving
like that, with no explanation.

22:58.750 --> 23:01.166
Morning, everyone!
I found clue!

23:01.291 --> 23:02.875
I know where to look
for Aunt Lucy!

23:03.708 --> 23:06.416
It's a place called Rumi Rock,
and look...

23:07.166 --> 23:09.125
...it's only a few days upriver.

23:09.250 --> 23:10.541
We can take breakfast with us.

23:10.666 --> 23:14.416
But wait, Paddington, what's going on?
Where did you get this old map?

23:14.541 --> 23:16.625
I found it in Aunt Lucy's room.

23:16.750 --> 23:19.375
In fact, I think she rather
wanted me to find it.

23:20.041 --> 23:24.041
Rumi Rock? What makes you think
we should start the search there?

23:24.166 --> 23:26.833
Well, Aunt Lucy has made a note.

23:26.958 --> 23:28.166
"Start search here".

23:30.583 --> 23:31.416
Fair enough.

23:34.250 --> 23:37.416
The Lord be praised!
I knew something would turn up.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.416
What is this Rumi Rock?

23:39.541 --> 23:42.875
It's a sacred Inca stone circle
deep in the jungle.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.708
And what's so special about it?

23:44.833 --> 23:45.750
No idea.

23:45.875 --> 23:48.083
Sacred Inca monuments
aren't really a nun thing.

23:49.583 --> 23:52.500
But it's a clue
to finding your Aunt Lucy.

23:52.625 --> 23:56.041
Seek out what she was looking for
and it may lead you to her.

23:56.625 --> 24:01.083
If anyone can do it,
it's you, young bear.

24:02.333 --> 24:04.291
Aunt Lucy always says,

24:04.416 --> 24:08.625
"When skies are grey
hope is the way."

24:09.541 --> 24:12.458
Right, well, just-just, you know...
hang on a minute.

24:12.583 --> 24:16.166
Surely someone from here
would be in a much better position to go...

24:16.291 --> 24:20.125
Oh, I don't permit myself or my nuns
to enter the jungle.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.083
I find it somewhat...

24:25.000 --> 24:26.333
...disquieting.

24:32.958 --> 24:33.958
(Chuckles nervously)

24:34.083 --> 24:36.708
I think it's best if I stay here
and tend my flock.

24:36.833 --> 24:40.791
But I commend your bravery
and I have faith that you will survive.

24:42.291 --> 24:43.458
That's reassuring.

24:43.583 --> 24:49.708
Mr Brown, if you feel you can't come...
I shall go on my own.

24:54.166 --> 24:58.125
Right. Well, obviously the Brown family
are clearly exactly the sort of people

24:58.250 --> 25:01.166
with the requisite skill-set
to go looking for a lost bear in the jungle.

25:01.791 --> 25:03.666
- Thank you, Mr Brown.
- Hallelujah!

25:04.208 --> 25:05.250
Mmm? No... Hmm.

25:05.916 --> 25:08.500
Now, don't forget to take these.

25:08.625 --> 25:11.291
You can give them to your aunt
when you find her.

25:11.416 --> 25:13.583
- Thank you very much, Reverend Mother.
- (Mrs Bird) I'll man basecamp.

25:13.708 --> 25:17.458
I'll make sure everything's shipshape
for when she gets back.

25:18.041 --> 25:20.833
Mmm... Mary? One thing.

25:20.958 --> 25:25.041
Would you forgive an old nun
her comforts?

25:25.166 --> 25:28.541
St Christopher, patron saint of travel.

25:28.666 --> 25:31.416
I do believe
he will keep your family safe.

25:31.541 --> 25:32.583
Keep him close?

25:33.583 --> 25:35.458
Yes, of course.

25:35.583 --> 25:39.500
Gosh, thank you so much.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.666
Well, we need all the help
we can get.

25:44.250 --> 25:45.708
Well, thank you.

25:47.208 --> 25:48.208
Thank you.

25:48.333 --> 25:49.833
I have to go now.

25:53.250 --> 25:56.708
(Paddington) We just need to find a boat
that will take us upriver.

25:56.833 --> 25:59.166
- I can do my own suncream, Mum!
- Just behind your ears!

25:59.291 --> 26:01.458
Everyone, listen up.

26:01.583 --> 26:04.166
We are on the threshold
of the actual Amazon,

26:04.291 --> 26:05.458
- a place full of risk.
- (Honks horn) Careful!

26:05.583 --> 26:07.000
(Mrs Brown) Oh!

26:07.875 --> 26:09.458
So, we're gonna embrace that.

26:09.583 --> 26:11.875
Mr Brown, why are you walking like that?

26:12.000 --> 26:14.416
- It's his hard walk.
- It's a perfectly normal walk.

26:14.541 --> 26:16.125
He does it
when the plumber comes round.

26:16.250 --> 26:17.250
I do not!

26:17.708 --> 26:21.416
Right. Look, whatever boat
we manage to get,

26:21.541 --> 26:25.625
I don't think it's exactly
going to be the pride of the regatta, okay?

26:25.750 --> 26:27.708
- Er... Mr Brown?
- Huh?

26:27.833 --> 26:30.333
- Look.
- Mmm?

26:30.458 --> 26:33.625
(♪ Opera playing on gramophone)

26:36.166 --> 26:39.166
Oh, what a handsome...

26:39.291 --> 26:41.375
- Mmm?
- Boat.

26:42.250 --> 26:45.291
Good idea, we'll ask the handsome captain.
Excuse me, sir.

26:45.416 --> 26:48.291
Is this boat for hire?

26:48.416 --> 26:49.958
For hire?

26:50.083 --> 26:54.916
Yeah, señor Bear...
and company.

26:55.041 --> 27:00.208
It is your lucky day!
This is the best boat on the river!

27:00.333 --> 27:05.958
Strong, smooth, easy on the eye
and... that's just the boat.

27:10.083 --> 27:11.291
- Yah-ha!
- (Mrs Brown) Ooh!

27:11.875 --> 27:13.375
Voilà!

27:14.416 --> 27:16.833
Captain Hunter Cabot
at your service.

27:16.958 --> 27:19.041
Oh, Paddington Brown.
Pleased to meet you.

27:19.166 --> 27:21.166
Gina, tour.

27:21.291 --> 27:24.041
Tour? We have many tours available.

27:24.166 --> 27:27.458
We could see the pink dolphins?

27:27.583 --> 27:30.333
- Take in some Inca ruins?
- Feed the piranhas.

27:30.458 --> 27:34.333
(Both) Although it may cost you
an arm and a leg!

27:34.458 --> 27:37.791
We need to go
to somewhere called Rumi Rock.

27:37.916 --> 27:39.916
Er... Rumi Rock?

27:40.041 --> 27:41.500
We don't go to Rumi Rock.

27:41.625 --> 27:43.583
Well, we could do with a tour...

27:44.208 --> 27:45.708
We don't need this one.

27:46.500 --> 27:47.666
Yeah...

27:49.125 --> 27:52.958
Well... I'm sorry, little bear,

27:53.083 --> 27:55.291
but you'll have to take your sightseeing
somewhere else.

27:55.416 --> 27:59.666
No, we're not sightseers.
It's an emergency, sir.

27:59.791 --> 28:02.291
My Aunt Lucy has gone missing.

28:02.416 --> 28:05.125
Now she's out there somewhere,
all alone.

28:06.291 --> 28:10.833
I'm her only family...
and I've lost her.

28:11.291 --> 28:15.458
Please can you make an exception,
just this once?

28:22.416 --> 28:25.625
(Judy) University application travelogue.

28:25.750 --> 28:29.666
Day two. We head off the tourist trail
and into the jungle,

28:29.791 --> 28:32.583
our fates in the hands
of the charming Captain Cabot

28:32.708 --> 28:34.125
and his daughter Gina.

28:34.250 --> 28:36.666
(Blows horn)

28:37.750 --> 28:41.625
Hey, Judy, take a photo with all this,
for the dudes back at the office.

28:41.750 --> 28:42.583
Dudes?

28:43.958 --> 28:46.458
Just take the photo.

28:47.916 --> 28:50.125
Well, your cabins are ready.

28:50.250 --> 28:53.083
From now on,
you must follow my orders.

28:53.208 --> 28:56.625
To the inexperienced,
a boat can pose many dangers...

28:56.750 --> 28:57.583
Boom!

28:59.291 --> 29:00.416
Thank you, Gina!

29:00.541 --> 29:02.458
She has to warn me.

29:03.708 --> 29:05.125
Every time!

29:06.250 --> 29:10.291
(♪ Plays "The Entertainer")

29:10.416 --> 29:12.958
(♪ Harmonising melody)

29:17.125 --> 29:18.375
(Mr Brown) Funny man.

29:18.500 --> 29:20.166
Welcome aboard.

29:20.291 --> 29:22.166
Who are these people?

29:22.291 --> 29:26.041
Er... those are my ancestors,
the Cabots.

29:26.166 --> 29:29.000
(Mrs Brown) Gosh, that's quite
a family resemblance.

29:29.125 --> 29:33.500
(Cabot) All the generations
from every corner of the globe.

29:33.625 --> 29:39.041
They like to keep an eye on me
just to make sure I bring glory on the family.

29:39.166 --> 29:40.875
That's like your tattoo.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.333
Oh, good spot, Mary.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.125
- What tattoo?
- Oh, he's got a tattoo...

29:46.250 --> 29:48.166
It's the Cabot family crest,

29:48.291 --> 29:50.250
the fist of gold.

29:50.375 --> 29:52.541
Very observant of you.

29:52.666 --> 29:54.208
A drunken night in Cusco, was it?

29:54.333 --> 29:56.166
- No.
- Ooh!

29:56.708 --> 30:00.458
Well, this is a badge of pride.

30:00.583 --> 30:03.083
All the Cabots have this tattoo.

30:04.916 --> 30:07.750
This was a drunken night in Cusco.

30:07.875 --> 30:09.541
- (All gasp)
- (Cabot laughs)

30:11.666 --> 30:13.375
Follow me.

30:13.916 --> 30:17.083
And finally, the Darwin Suite.

30:18.333 --> 30:19.541
Oh, yes, well...

30:19.666 --> 30:22.666
- That's more like it.
- (Mrs Brown) Isn't it so charming?

30:25.708 --> 30:28.791
The old purple kneed tarantula.

30:28.916 --> 30:33.250
It's... my husband's got
a bit of a thing about spiders and bugs.

30:33.375 --> 30:34.708
In fact, he's got a whole folder...

30:34.833 --> 30:36.916
Don't bother the Captain
with all that, darling.

30:37.041 --> 30:38.041
No, sorry.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.416
- Enjoy.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

30:43.541 --> 30:45.041
It's so nice.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.500
- Looks like a nice firm mattress.
- Yes. Lovely.

31:10.666 --> 31:13.625
Rumi Rock, huh?

31:13.750 --> 31:15.875
Do not fail us this time.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.333
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco,
seis, siete, ocho, nueve, diez.

31:18.458 --> 31:21.208
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco,
seis, siete, ocho, nueve...

31:24.375 --> 31:27.958
I was going through my bag,
and look what I found: Travel Scrabble.

31:28.083 --> 31:30.791
It's your favourite, isn't it?
Quick game?

31:30.916 --> 31:33.541
Mum, I really need to work
on my travelogue.

31:34.125 --> 31:35.375
Oh.

31:39.416 --> 31:41.166
"Travelogue"...

31:41.833 --> 31:44.583
Fourteen points.
That's without the triple word score.

31:44.708 --> 31:46.291
(Chuckling)

31:52.333 --> 31:54.583
(Paddington) 'I can't keep the line, Mrs Bird.'

31:54.708 --> 31:56.666
You're breaking up, dear.

31:56.791 --> 32:01.416
Mr Brown says these satellite phone calls
are very expensive.

32:01.541 --> 32:03.208
- What?
- 'Expensive!'

32:03.333 --> 32:05.750
E-X-P...

32:05.875 --> 32:07.750
Ugh! It's gone again!

32:08.583 --> 32:12.041
Oh, these satellite phones
are very temperamental.

32:12.166 --> 32:15.250
Oh, no! No...
No, no, it's not that. It's...

32:15.875 --> 32:20.666
It's like this building is filled
with electrical interference.

32:21.208 --> 32:23.000
It's a very old building, Mrs Bird.

32:23.125 --> 32:24.958
Nothing suspicious about it.

32:27.208 --> 32:28.250
Suspicious?

32:34.000 --> 32:36.750
Oh. Oh, knees...

32:36.875 --> 32:39.458
What are you telling me?

32:40.458 --> 32:43.750
Has there been any news
of Aunt Lucy?

32:43.875 --> 32:46.166
Oh... no, dear, I'm afraid not.

32:46.958 --> 32:48.500
(Sighs)

32:50.416 --> 32:52.583
We'll find her, Paddington.

32:59.666 --> 33:03.083
(Hunter) Tomorrow,
we will arrive to Rumi Rock.

33:03.208 --> 33:06.208
- So, a toast...
- (Paddington slurping)

33:09.875 --> 33:10.708
Mmm!

33:12.333 --> 33:14.458
Oh, excuse me.

33:14.583 --> 33:17.791
- ...to finding Aunt Lucy.
- Hear hear!

33:19.041 --> 33:20.875
- Well, it's certainly interesting.
- (Mrs Brown) Mmm! Mmm!

33:23.833 --> 33:25.625
So, uh...

33:25.750 --> 33:28.625
- tell me, young bear...
- Hmm!

33:28.750 --> 33:31.833
...why was your aunt so interested
in Rumi Rock?

33:32.750 --> 33:34.583
We don't know, Mr Hunter.

33:34.708 --> 33:36.666
The Reverend Mother said
she was looking for something.

33:36.791 --> 33:38.416
She was wasting her time.

33:38.541 --> 33:41.041
Rumi Rock is just a bunch of old stones.

33:43.083 --> 33:46.083
A bunch of old stones that,
according to legend,

33:46.208 --> 33:49.958
is the first step to finding...
El Dorado.

33:51.041 --> 33:53.541
What? You mean...

33:54.166 --> 33:55.541
- Hmm!
- (Electricity crackling)

33:55.666 --> 33:57.041
Nice chips!

33:57.166 --> 34:01.916
- He means the mythical lost city, not...
- Oh. Right.

34:02.041 --> 34:05.083
When the Spanish invaders came,

34:05.208 --> 34:10.208
they found all the treasures of Peru,
except for one.

34:10.958 --> 34:13.083
The most precious treasure of all.

34:13.958 --> 34:15.000
Hmm?

34:15.125 --> 34:18.541
The gold which the Incas valued
more than anything else.

34:19.583 --> 34:21.916
But it could not be found.

34:22.041 --> 34:29.500
And this is because the Incas entrusted it
to "Los Espiritus del Bosque".

34:31.166 --> 34:34.375
The spirits of the jungle

34:34.500 --> 34:38.875
who promised to keep it secret
and hidden in the forest forever.

34:40.666 --> 34:44.500
Now... that's El Dorado.

34:46.166 --> 34:52.166
So, are you suggesting that
Aunt Lucy was looking for El Dorado?

34:52.916 --> 34:54.791
Aren't we all?

34:54.916 --> 34:57.083
In our own ways.

34:58.041 --> 34:59.041
No?

35:01.375 --> 35:04.166
But why would she be looking
for El Dorado, Mrs Brown?

35:04.291 --> 35:06.000
She has no interest in gold.

35:06.125 --> 35:08.666
Let's not get carried away with...
(Chuckles)

35:08.791 --> 35:11.000
...some old pictures in a book.

35:11.125 --> 35:14.291
If El Dorado exists,
why has no one found it?

35:14.416 --> 35:17.708
Because none of them had... this.

35:19.250 --> 35:22.625
It is said the only clue
the Incas left

35:22.750 --> 35:25.916
to where the spirits of the jungle
hid the gold

35:26.041 --> 35:28.708
was in a special bracelet.

35:30.333 --> 35:32.958
- A bracelet... like this!
- Ooh!

35:33.083 --> 35:34.250
(Mary gasps)

35:35.375 --> 35:36.916
Where did you get that?

35:37.041 --> 35:38.708
It's Aunt Lucy's.

35:38.833 --> 35:40.000
She always wore it.

35:40.125 --> 35:43.791
And it is the key to finding El Dorado
and all its treasures.

35:43.916 --> 35:45.625
- Wow!
- (Scoffs)

35:45.750 --> 35:49.875
There's no reason why Aunt Lucy
would have an ancient Inca bracelet.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.958
- But she did! Look! It's the same!
- It may very well look the same.

35:53.083 --> 35:55.000
Honestly, Henry,
you're really taking the fun out of this.

35:55.125 --> 36:00.375
- It's just an ordinary stringy bracelet.
- It's not an ordinary bracelet. It is...

36:00.500 --> 36:01.916
- (Paddington grunting)
- Oh!

36:02.041 --> 36:04.625
(Paddington) I'm OK.
Nothing broken.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.125
- ...Quipu.
- Quip-who?

36:10.958 --> 36:13.208
An ancient Incan knot language

36:13.333 --> 36:16.500
used for secret messages,
hidden in riddles.

36:16.625 --> 36:21.833
So, if we work out what this says,
it might help us find Aunt Lucy?

36:23.416 --> 36:26.250
Lend me this bracelet for a few hours.

36:27.208 --> 36:29.416
I may be able to translate it.

36:29.541 --> 36:33.375
Everyone who searches
for El Dorado dies.

36:37.500 --> 36:42.708
Then... we can't let that happen
to Aunt Lucy.

36:43.500 --> 36:45.791
Hmm... (Chuckles)

36:45.916 --> 36:50.041
(Judy) 'Later came the Spanish conquest
of the Incas,

36:50.166 --> 36:52.375
'and with them the gold hunters.

36:53.916 --> 36:58.458
'The greediest of all
was Gonzalo Caboto.'

36:58.583 --> 36:59.958
(Spraying)

37:00.833 --> 37:03.708
Ugh! What is that smell?

37:03.833 --> 37:06.208
Gotta smell good in the jungle,
you know?

37:06.333 --> 37:08.750
- (Mrs Brown) Night night, guys!
- Night.

37:08.875 --> 37:10.750
- (Judy) Night.
- Love you!

37:11.750 --> 37:13.916
Clear. No spiders under here.

37:14.041 --> 37:15.750
(Paddington) Night night, Mrs Brown!

37:15.875 --> 37:17.291
(Mrs Brown) Night, Paddington.

37:17.416 --> 37:19.125
Looks simple enough.

37:21.166 --> 37:22.500
Mmm...

37:24.583 --> 37:26.333
Mmm... ooh!

37:26.458 --> 37:27.791
Uh-uh...

37:27.916 --> 37:29.500
Oh...!

37:31.041 --> 37:37.208
Now, the trick with a hammock
is not to let it see you... coming!

37:37.333 --> 37:39.125
Whoa! Ugh!

37:39.916 --> 37:42.250
(Grunting)

37:42.375 --> 37:44.958
Nice hammock...
Steady! Steady! Ugh!

37:45.750 --> 37:49.166
There we go.
It's not as comfortable...

37:49.291 --> 37:50.875
(Grunting)

37:51.000 --> 37:52.500
Argh!

37:53.375 --> 37:54.708
(Mumbles)

37:54.833 --> 37:56.666
(Snoring)

38:11.375 --> 38:14.041
- What does it say?
- It doesn't make any sense.

38:14.166 --> 38:16.291
- Why not?
- Cos it's a riddle!

38:16.416 --> 38:18.666
- Who are you talking to?
- Uh-oh!

38:19.833 --> 38:21.375
No one.

38:21.500 --> 38:24.208
You're seeing the ghosts again,
aren't you?

38:24.333 --> 38:27.416
Gina... I'm fine.

38:28.833 --> 38:31.125
But you made me a promise.

38:31.250 --> 38:34.208
- We don't need gold.
- And... And you are right,

38:34.333 --> 38:38.000
but if we had it,
we could buy a real house

38:38.125 --> 38:41.416
- with stairs and beds and square windows!
- Papa!

38:41.541 --> 38:44.208
We could bring honour on the family.

38:44.333 --> 38:46.416
But we only need each other,

38:46.541 --> 38:49.958
and I'm scared
I'm going to lose you again,

38:50.083 --> 38:51.458
for good this time.

38:54.250 --> 38:57.750
Please... turn the boat around.

39:00.041 --> 39:02.875
Don't listen to her!
She doesn't understand.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.791
We need the gold! The glory!

39:04.916 --> 39:06.375
Right!

39:07.583 --> 39:11.666
- Let's turn the boat round right now!
- You mean it?

39:11.791 --> 39:15.250
You are my treasure, and I love you.

39:15.375 --> 39:18.375
Go untie the mooring rope.
Go! Go! Go!

39:20.291 --> 39:23.375
Valiente idiota. ¡Nunca!

39:24.000 --> 39:26.583
You were never a Cabot.

39:26.708 --> 39:28.166
Never!

39:30.708 --> 39:32.416
I'm proud of you, Papa.

39:33.041 --> 39:35.750
This could be
a whole new chapter in our...

39:37.541 --> 39:38.583
Papa?

39:38.708 --> 39:40.125
- I love you, Gina...
- Papa!

39:40.250 --> 39:42.416
...but I have to get that gold.
I have to!

39:42.541 --> 39:44.125
You double-crossing pig!
Mentiroso!

39:44.250 --> 39:46.208
I am doing this for the both of us!

39:46.333 --> 39:48.958
I promise I'll come back for you
tomorrow!

39:49.083 --> 39:51.416
(Gina) Argh! Papa!

39:51.541 --> 39:54.541
You can't even drive that boat
without me!

39:55.333 --> 39:56.916
Wow!

39:57.041 --> 39:58.750
I think she took that well.

39:58.875 --> 40:01.333
And you...
You had me there!

40:01.458 --> 40:04.458
Maybe you're not a failure
after all, you know?

40:05.583 --> 40:07.875
All right!
We have some work to do.

40:08.541 --> 40:09.666
(Creaking)

40:09.791 --> 40:11.791
What's that creaking noise?

40:12.416 --> 40:14.125
Boom!

40:22.125 --> 40:24.791
(Gasps, babbles) Oh!

40:29.416 --> 40:31.666
Good morning, Paddington.
Did you sleep well?

40:31.791 --> 40:34.333
I keep having the strangest dream.

40:34.458 --> 40:36.458
Has anyone seen Mr Hunter?

40:36.583 --> 40:38.541
I'd like to know
if he's translated the bracelet.

40:38.666 --> 40:41.458
Or perhaps made us some breakfast.

40:41.583 --> 40:43.875
It's after ten, Mary!

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
Hello?
Any chance of some coffee?

40:47.833 --> 40:51.875
It clearly states that breakfast
is served between 8:30 and 10:30.

40:52.875 --> 40:56.000
- Good morning, gentlemen... and madam.
- (Mr Brown keeps muttering)

40:56.833 --> 40:58.375
Hello?

40:58.500 --> 41:00.208
Mr Hunter?

41:00.333 --> 41:01.791
Gina?

41:04.208 --> 41:06.041
Is it me or is it getting a bit choppy?

41:08.625 --> 41:10.208
- (♪ Piano strikes up)
- Ooh!

41:11.458 --> 41:13.625
(♪ Johann Strauss II's "Blue Danube Waltz"
playing on piano)

41:13.750 --> 41:15.791
(Paddington grunting)

41:18.958 --> 41:20.083
Marmalade!

41:25.875 --> 41:28.958
Shouldn't someone be driving?

41:30.083 --> 41:31.541
(Feedback on PA system)

41:31.666 --> 41:33.541
Gina? Mr Hunter?

41:34.916 --> 41:37.666
Ah! Better make an announcement!

41:39.625 --> 41:41.500
(Grunting)

41:41.625 --> 41:44.125
There we... go! Oh! Ooh!

41:51.125 --> 41:54.000
(Groaning)

41:54.125 --> 41:55.916
Oh!

41:56.041 --> 41:57.041
Huh!

41:58.041 --> 41:59.083
Oh, dear!

41:59.625 --> 42:04.416
Good morning. Please, could the Brown family
pop up to the front of the boat

42:04.541 --> 42:08.416
- for a slight, uh... emergency.
- Huh?

42:11.875 --> 42:14.458
- Left a bit...
- (Groaning)

42:14.583 --> 42:17.083
- Right a bit.
- Paddington!

42:17.958 --> 42:19.500
(Paddington) Rather a lot of rocks!

42:19.625 --> 42:22.625
Paddington, what on earth
are you doing in there?

42:22.750 --> 42:25.500
I appear to be driving the boat,
Mrs Brown.

42:25.625 --> 42:27.875
- But where's Gina?
- She's not here!

42:28.000 --> 42:29.916
I don't think Mr Hunter's here either!

42:30.041 --> 42:32.791
Paddington, put it in reverse,
put the boat in reverse!

42:32.916 --> 42:34.375
Good idea!

42:34.500 --> 42:36.708
Reverse... That'll do it!

42:36.833 --> 42:38.958
- (Engine speeding up)
- (Paddington) Oh!

42:39.083 --> 42:40.833
- (All groaning)
- That's faster!

42:44.708 --> 42:46.000
Get the lifejackets!

42:49.166 --> 42:52.000
Where's Paddington?
Isn't he at the wheel?

42:52.125 --> 42:53.791
(Paddington) No! I appear to be...

42:54.833 --> 42:57.666
...on the wheel!
Clear the decks!

42:59.541 --> 43:03.750
Henry, the lifejackets!
Here! Emergency supplies!

43:04.500 --> 43:05.541
What?

43:07.708 --> 43:11.291
- Hang on, Paddington.
- (Paddington groaning)

43:11.416 --> 43:13.041
Come back!

43:14.583 --> 43:16.125
Found the lifejackets!

43:16.250 --> 43:17.958
Abandon ship?

43:18.083 --> 43:20.208
Yes! Abandon ship!
Come on!

43:24.000 --> 43:26.833
Come on, everybody.
Three, two, one... jump!

43:26.958 --> 43:28.791
Aunt Lucy's glasses!

43:31.375 --> 43:34.291
(Wailing)

43:37.791 --> 43:40.583
Grab hold of anything that floats!

43:46.458 --> 43:47.833
Triple-laminated.

43:47.958 --> 43:50.250
Wait... Paddington!

43:50.375 --> 43:51.625
- Paddington!
- Where is he?

43:51.750 --> 43:53.208
Where's Paddington?

43:53.333 --> 43:55.250
Paddington!

43:55.833 --> 43:57.583
(Gasping for air)

43:57.708 --> 44:00.000
Found them! Good piano!

44:00.666 --> 44:03.083
Paddington!

44:03.208 --> 44:04.750
Come on.

44:11.583 --> 44:14.041
(Judy) Day Three.
With the Browns lost in the jungle,

44:14.166 --> 44:16.583
everyone was thinking the same thing.

44:16.708 --> 44:18.333
How long till we eat each other?

44:18.458 --> 44:20.875
(Mr Brown) That's not helpful, Judy.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.583
Whoop! Mmm!

44:23.708 --> 44:25.041
(Grunting)

44:25.166 --> 44:27.875
(Mrs Brown) Well, we wanted
a holiday to remember!

44:28.000 --> 44:30.041
At this rate, we may not be around
to remember it.

44:30.166 --> 44:34.458
Maybe we should just draw a big SOS
in the sand and chill here?

44:35.583 --> 44:37.000
"Chill here"?

44:37.125 --> 44:39.458
This is the Amazon,
not a shopping centre!

44:39.583 --> 44:41.833
All we need is a... plan!

44:45.250 --> 44:47.583
I have a plan, Mrs Brown.

44:48.416 --> 44:50.250
Mm-hmm?

44:50.375 --> 44:51.958
Um...

44:52.083 --> 44:55.083
We find Rumi Rock ourselves.

44:55.208 --> 44:58.083
It can't be far, and whatever's happened
to Hunter and Gina,

44:58.208 --> 45:00.625
they're bound to look for us there.

45:00.750 --> 45:03.041
Are you sure you can find the way?

45:03.166 --> 45:05.666
You have spent rather a long time
in London, Paddington.

45:05.791 --> 45:09.333
Mr Brown, you can take the bear
out of the jungle,

45:09.458 --> 45:12.291
but you can't take the jungle
out of the bear.

45:12.416 --> 45:14.375
- (Animal growling)
- (Paddington gasps)

45:15.625 --> 45:17.291
- Uh... anyway, follow me.
- Yes.

45:17.416 --> 45:19.750
Oh, and remember, whatever you do...

45:20.791 --> 45:22.666
...never touch this plant.

45:22.791 --> 45:25.750
- What's it called?
- The Spiky Red One.

45:26.916 --> 45:30.041
This'll be fun,
a short stroll in the jungle.

45:31.625 --> 45:34.250
(Mr Brown) And we're sure
this is a good idea, are we?

45:34.375 --> 45:37.375
(Mrs Brown) I don't think it's gonna be
that far to get to Rumi Rock. It can't be!

45:37.500 --> 45:40.083
People have gone there in the past.

45:43.708 --> 45:45.916
(Phone ringing)

45:48.250 --> 45:51.583
(Scoffs) What is wrong with this thing?

45:57.250 --> 45:59.375
What have we here?

46:00.541 --> 46:03.250
Oh! Very strange!

46:03.375 --> 46:05.625
(Woman) It's Bingo time!

46:05.750 --> 46:09.666
- Oh, pardon.
- (Woman) Eyes down for a full house!

46:10.666 --> 46:14.250
- Noah's Ark, all the twos!
- Ooh!

46:15.208 --> 46:17.916
- Days and nights, 40!
- Ooh, I got one!

46:20.083 --> 46:22.041
(Woman) All the horsemen...

46:22.166 --> 46:25.833
Horsemen of the Apocalypse,
number four.

46:27.750 --> 46:31.041
The Holy Trinity, number three.

46:40.541 --> 46:42.833
Do you play, Mrs Bird?

46:44.791 --> 46:46.791
What's behind this organ?

46:46.916 --> 46:49.375
Oh, nothing to be concerned about.

46:50.625 --> 46:54.000
What about the lights and the humming?

46:54.666 --> 46:56.416
It's just a secret room.

46:56.541 --> 46:58.541
A secret room?

46:59.666 --> 47:03.291
- Well, what have you got in there?
- Oh, well, I'm afraid I can't tell you.

47:04.583 --> 47:05.750
That's strange.

47:05.875 --> 47:09.041
I don't know what you're finding
strange about it, Mrs Bird.

47:09.166 --> 47:13.541
It's just a secret room behind an organ,
and I can't tell you what's inside it.

47:13.666 --> 47:15.333
Nothing suspicious about it.

47:17.000 --> 47:21.875
D'you know, that is the second time
you've used the word "suspicious"?

47:22.000 --> 47:23.458
Oh, is it?

47:23.583 --> 47:26.083
Well, the Lord moves
in suspicious ways.

47:26.208 --> 47:28.458
You mean "mysterious ways"?

47:29.125 --> 47:32.791
Oh! You know your scripture,
Mrs Bird. (Chuckles)

47:32.916 --> 47:34.416
Anyway, come along.
Time for Bingo!

47:36.791 --> 47:37.833
Aye!

47:38.916 --> 47:40.416
Bingo!

47:40.541 --> 47:43.208
(Mr Brown) Do you think
it will be much further, Paddington?

47:43.333 --> 47:46.916
(Paddington) Fairly sure
Rumi Rock should be just through here.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.916
- Little bit further...
- Ooh! Oh!

47:50.041 --> 47:52.000
Just along here...

47:52.666 --> 47:54.041
...I think.

47:57.208 --> 47:58.625
This way.

47:59.541 --> 48:02.375
Just... over here.

48:03.875 --> 48:05.083
Or here.

48:05.208 --> 48:07.666
- And... left. Oh, no!
- (Mrs Brown) Oh!

48:07.791 --> 48:09.666
(Paddington) That is a cliff. Right.

48:10.458 --> 48:11.875
Yes, that is right.

48:15.625 --> 48:17.750
(Mr Brown) Paddington,
don't take this the wrong way,

48:17.875 --> 48:20.125
but are you sure
you know where we are?

48:20.250 --> 48:23.416
Oh, yes, Mr Brown. We are...

48:23.541 --> 48:26.333
Well, perhaps a little...

48:27.833 --> 48:28.833
...lost.

48:28.958 --> 48:31.000
(Sighs) Marvellous!

48:31.125 --> 48:33.000
At least we've dried off.

48:33.625 --> 48:35.875
(Thunderclap)

48:42.458 --> 48:46.791
(Mrs Brown) I spy with my little eye

48:46.916 --> 48:49.250
something beginning with...

48:49.375 --> 48:51.208
- (Animal screeching)
- Whoa!

48:54.333 --> 48:55.791
Doesn't matter.

48:55.916 --> 48:58.791
Let's do our best
to get some sleep,

48:58.916 --> 49:03.500
even if we are all completely drenched
in a snake-infested jungle.

49:03.625 --> 49:05.375
(Mrs Brown) What happened to
"embracing the risk"?

49:05.500 --> 49:08.625
(Mr Brown) I've tried that, Mary.
God knows I've tried.

49:08.750 --> 49:10.958
But we don't belong here.

49:11.083 --> 49:13.250
And quite frankly,
neither does Paddington.

49:15.625 --> 49:17.166
(Thunder rumbling)

49:17.291 --> 49:19.208
(Rain pattering)

49:31.666 --> 49:34.166
Where are you, Aunt Lucy?

49:40.000 --> 49:41.958
Aunt Lucy...

49:48.041 --> 49:50.041
Aunt Lucy!

49:52.083 --> 49:53.583
(Gasps)

49:58.666 --> 49:59.666
Aunt Lucy!

50:03.916 --> 50:04.916
Aunt Lucy?

50:09.416 --> 50:11.791
I thought I'd... lost you.

50:12.458 --> 50:14.875
Oh, Paddington!

50:15.000 --> 50:19.916
Can't you see that it is you
who are lost?

50:20.833 --> 50:22.833
(Paddington) Aunt Lucy!

50:22.958 --> 50:24.916
- (Thunder rumbling)
- (Gasps)

50:31.458 --> 50:33.000
Mmm..

50:42.208 --> 50:45.000
Argh! Oh! (Grunting)

50:45.125 --> 50:47.083
- (Bird squawking)
- Sorry!

50:47.208 --> 50:50.000
Argh! (Screaming)

50:56.416 --> 50:58.750
Oh! You again!

51:05.833 --> 51:07.291
Oh!

51:27.583 --> 51:29.458
(Thunderclap)

51:33.375 --> 51:35.166
(Roaring)

51:36.916 --> 51:38.250
- (Twig snapping)
- (Gasps)

51:38.375 --> 51:41.083
Ha, little bear!

51:41.208 --> 51:42.666
(Paddington) Mr Hunter!

51:43.333 --> 51:44.750
Thank goodness you're safe!

51:45.500 --> 51:48.083
- Whatever happened to you and Gina?
- Welcome...

51:49.666 --> 51:50.833
...to Rumi Rock.

51:50.958 --> 51:54.750
(Gasps) This is Rumi Rock!
Is Aunt Lucy here?

51:55.375 --> 51:56.750
- No.
- Oh!

51:56.875 --> 51:58.833
But I think she was here.

51:59.583 --> 52:04.791
Remember I told you Rumi Rock
was the gateway to El Dorado?

52:05.333 --> 52:06.375
Yes...?

52:06.500 --> 52:09.916
That's why we can't find her here,
Paddington.

52:10.041 --> 52:14.916
Because she has already found
her way there.

52:15.041 --> 52:17.625
And what makes you think that,
Mr Hunter?

52:18.333 --> 52:19.791
(Chuckling)

52:24.291 --> 52:27.416
(Gasps) You translated the Quipu!

52:27.541 --> 52:28.708
What does it say?

52:28.833 --> 52:32.250
It says, "At Rumi Rock...

52:33.458 --> 52:37.250
"...the bear will show the way."

52:39.875 --> 52:42.333
Right!
And what bear would that be?

52:44.958 --> 52:48.208
You-you-you tell me.
You are the bear.

52:48.916 --> 52:50.125
Mmm!

52:50.250 --> 52:51.958
I see!

52:52.083 --> 52:54.541
And there isn't another message
written on the back? Because sometimes...

52:54.666 --> 52:58.041
No, no, no, no, no!
It says, "The bear will show the way."

52:58.166 --> 53:00.500
Now, you... are the bear!

53:00.625 --> 53:02.541
That's a bear!

53:02.666 --> 53:06.041
This talisman's got a bear on it.
You know? So...

53:06.166 --> 53:10.708
This whole thing is really... beary!

53:10.833 --> 53:12.666
Yes, really quite beary.

53:12.791 --> 53:17.208
So, what do we do... Bear?

53:19.083 --> 53:24.500
I don't know, Mr Hunter,
but Aunt Lucy always says,

53:24.625 --> 53:30.875
"When you're faced with a problem,
sit down and put on your thinking cap."

53:31.875 --> 53:33.750
(Snapping)

53:33.875 --> 53:36.833
(Roaring)

53:36.958 --> 53:40.916
(Echoing)

53:46.625 --> 53:48.125
Oh...

53:48.250 --> 53:50.625
Please excuse me, Mr Hunter.

53:50.750 --> 53:54.291
It seems I sat on the Spiky Red One.

53:54.416 --> 53:55.916
(Distant roaring)

53:59.791 --> 54:00.875
What was that?

54:03.458 --> 54:06.708
(Aunt Lucy) 'If you ever get lost again...

54:06.833 --> 54:11.583
(Aunt Lucy and Paddington)
'...just roar and I'll roar right back.'

54:13.416 --> 54:14.833
(Roars)

54:18.666 --> 54:20.916
(Distant roaring)

54:21.583 --> 54:24.375
Aunt Lucy! She can hear me!

54:24.500 --> 54:26.750
That's how we find her, Mr Hunter.

54:26.875 --> 54:29.333
Like she always said.

54:29.458 --> 54:31.000
Follow her roars.

54:31.125 --> 54:32.625
(Thunder rumbling)

54:32.750 --> 54:34.208
(Thunderclap)

54:34.333 --> 54:36.166
(Door creaking)

55:08.375 --> 55:09.708
(Bell dings)

55:15.666 --> 55:17.333
(Beeping)

55:17.458 --> 55:19.708
What in God's name...?

55:19.833 --> 55:21.291
Language, Mrs Bird!

55:21.416 --> 55:26.583
What... Beg your pardon, Reverend Mother,
but this place...

55:26.708 --> 55:29.583
It looks kind of like an evil lair.

55:29.708 --> 55:32.041
- Oh, I can assure you it's not.
- (Whirring)

55:32.625 --> 55:34.458
(Mrs Bird muttering)

55:37.083 --> 55:39.625
But... Then, what is it?

55:39.750 --> 55:45.333
What it is, is a perfectly innocent
secret surveillance control centre.

55:46.291 --> 55:48.791
And why on earth
would you need one of those?

55:49.708 --> 55:52.625
I confess, Mrs Bird, I have sinned!

55:52.750 --> 55:55.791
I have been deceitful
in a way most unbecoming of a nun,

55:55.916 --> 55:58.041
and I can only pray
for your forgiveness!

55:58.583 --> 55:59.583
What have you done?

56:00.416 --> 56:04.750
The St Christopher medal I gave Mary
is actually a secret tracking device.

56:04.875 --> 56:07.625
I couldn't let what happened
to poor Aunt Lucy happen again,

56:07.750 --> 56:09.666
so I've been keeping an eye
on them.

56:15.333 --> 56:17.041
Oh, my!

56:18.208 --> 56:20.208
That's a canny bit of kit!

56:20.833 --> 56:22.666
Someone's been a busy nun.

56:22.791 --> 56:25.125
Well, thank goodness I have.
You see, this is Rumi Rock...

56:26.541 --> 56:28.791
...and this is the Browns' route.

56:28.916 --> 56:30.250
And they were heading
in the right direction,

56:30.375 --> 56:34.666
but now they're heading north
into uncharted, dangerous jungle,

56:34.791 --> 56:36.916
and I fear for their safety.

56:37.583 --> 56:38.916
I'll alert the authorities.

56:39.041 --> 56:40.666
We'll mount a rescue party!

56:41.333 --> 56:44.458
No! Because they'll be too slow.
(Chuckles nervously)

56:44.583 --> 56:46.625
We must go ourselves.

56:46.750 --> 56:50.416
I thought you didnae go
trekking in the jungle?

56:50.541 --> 56:53.708
I thought it gave ye
the heebie-jeebies.

56:55.708 --> 56:57.666
I wasn't planning on trekking.

57:10.583 --> 57:11.666
Mary!

57:11.791 --> 57:13.875
Not with the kids around.

57:19.125 --> 57:21.291
- (Screaming)
- Shh!

57:22.375 --> 57:24.541
There's something big out there.

57:26.958 --> 57:27.958
Hello?

57:32.041 --> 57:33.875
Whatever you are...

57:35.250 --> 57:37.375
...you should know...

57:38.666 --> 57:41.458
...that I've got a twig here,

57:42.458 --> 57:45.083
...and I am not afraid to use it.

57:46.166 --> 57:48.000
(Leaves rustling)

57:52.791 --> 57:55.166
(Screaming)

57:55.291 --> 57:56.833
Mary!

57:57.666 --> 57:58.958
- (Leaves rustling)
- (Thud)

57:59.083 --> 58:00.666
- (Gina) Ow!
- (Mrs Brown) Oh! Oh, no!

58:01.333 --> 58:04.250
Oh, Gina, I am so sorry.

58:04.375 --> 58:07.708
I... I thought you were some sort
of a fierce creature or something like...

58:07.833 --> 58:09.416
¡Hola, Browns!

58:09.541 --> 58:12.125
¡Gracias a Dios!
You're OK.

58:12.250 --> 58:14.208
Pretty pleased to see you, too.

58:14.333 --> 58:18.000
It was very clever using Jonathan's
deodorant spray as an odour trail.

58:18.791 --> 58:21.208
Oh, yeah, I mean... that was the idea.

58:21.333 --> 58:22.375
Where did you get to?

58:22.500 --> 58:24.958
You and your father abandoned us
on an abandoned ship!

58:25.083 --> 58:26.708
- It wasn't abandoned.
- Yes, it was.

58:26.833 --> 58:28.125
It was only abandoned
after we abandoned it.

58:28.250 --> 58:30.250
Where is your tattooed father?

58:30.375 --> 58:32.916
There is something about him...

58:33.041 --> 58:34.458
I knew it.

58:34.583 --> 58:36.333
...about us...

58:37.416 --> 58:40.375
...that I should've told you
from the very beginning.

58:44.458 --> 58:47.916
My family are cursed
with a dreadful disease.

58:48.916 --> 58:53.583
They call it el oro loco,
gold madness.

58:53.708 --> 58:56.625
It began with my ancestor,
Gonzalo Caboto.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.208
'He was greedy and ruthless,

59:00.333 --> 59:02.958
'and when he heard
the legend of El Dorado,

59:03.083 --> 59:07.041
'he came looking for it,
driving his men to exhaustion.

59:08.833 --> 59:11.916
'He ate what he had to,
to stay alive,

59:12.041 --> 59:13.291
'but it was pointless.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.208
'Instead of riches,

59:15.333 --> 59:19.166
'all he passed onto his descendants
was greed.'

59:19.291 --> 59:21.333
(Evil chuckle)

59:21.458 --> 59:23.083
Huh? Oh!

59:24.208 --> 59:29.458
(Gina) 'Generation after generation,
fools in their pursuit of El Dorado.'

59:29.583 --> 59:31.125
- (Thud)
- Crikey!

59:32.333 --> 59:35.666
(Gina) 'Gold fever drew them
from every corner of the globe.'

59:44.250 --> 59:47.333
♪ Onward Christian soldiers... ♪

59:47.458 --> 59:50.041
(Gina) 'They came from all walks of life.

59:51.833 --> 59:55.416
'But all any of them found was death.'

59:55.541 --> 59:57.208
(Bubbling)

59:58.041 --> 59:59.500
My father was different.

01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:03.875
Mama died when I was young,
so it was always just us.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.500
He was determined to beat the curse,

01:00:06.625 --> 01:00:11.333
'but when he heard of Rumi Rock,
it took hold of him.

01:00:11.458 --> 01:00:14.125
'He disappeared into the jungle.

01:00:15.458 --> 01:00:17.875
'And I was left alone.

01:00:18.875 --> 01:00:20.333
'For years.

01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:27.833
'When he returned...'

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.125
(Panting)

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:30.083
Gina!

01:00:30.208 --> 01:00:34.750
(Gina) '...he promised he would keep away
from the jungle and its ghosts.

01:00:34.875 --> 01:00:39.250
'He would stick to the river
and never love gold more than me.

01:00:39.375 --> 01:00:40.666
'I believed him.'

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:42.750
Seems I was a fool.

01:00:42.875 --> 01:00:45.791
- Oh, Gina!
- Mmm! (Chuckles)

01:00:45.916 --> 01:00:47.333
- Why, what is it?
- Nothing.

01:00:47.458 --> 01:00:51.833
No, just goes to show you should never trust
a handsome riverboat captain.

01:00:51.958 --> 01:00:54.416
- I never said he was handsome.
- You were thinking it!

01:00:54.541 --> 01:00:58.416
Now he is haunted
by the ghosts of ancestors

01:00:58.541 --> 01:01:01.083
and will do anything to get his gold.

01:01:01.208 --> 01:01:03.958
I must get you and Paddington to safety.

01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:05.875
Where is Paddington?

01:01:07.958 --> 01:01:10.583
(Roaring)

01:01:10.708 --> 01:01:12.375
(Echoing roar)

01:01:14.458 --> 01:01:16.250
(Echoing roar)

01:01:16.375 --> 01:01:18.541
This way, Mr Hunter!

01:01:18.666 --> 01:01:22.875
We'll follow her roars,
and we'll find her in no time!

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:30.666
(Gonzalo) 'Do it. Cabotos don't share!'

01:01:41.916 --> 01:01:43.916
We're getting close, Mr Hunter.

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:49.375
And you're sure the river taxi service
will have rescued the Browns by now?

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:52.500
- Yes.
- Oh, that is a relief.

01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:55.625
Mr Brown did have
some rather wet socks.

01:01:56.833 --> 01:02:00.291
One more push,
and we'll be with Aunt Lucy.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Hey! What's with all the chitchat?
Get moving!

01:02:04.125 --> 01:02:06.083
I know what I have to do.

01:02:06.208 --> 01:02:10.291
Is everything... all right, Mr Hunter?

01:02:11.583 --> 01:02:12.833
Yes...

01:02:13.958 --> 01:02:17.583
There are just expectations
from my family.

01:02:17.708 --> 01:02:20.666
Oh. I didn't know you had other family.

01:02:20.791 --> 01:02:23.500
Hmm...
Do you see them much?

01:02:23.625 --> 01:02:25.166
All the time, yes.

01:02:27.166 --> 01:02:29.041
How lovely.

01:02:29.166 --> 01:02:31.416
You know how families can be.

01:02:31.541 --> 01:02:34.000
Yes. Well, sort of.

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:38.333
The only family I've known
is the Browns and Aunt Lucy.

01:02:38.458 --> 01:02:43.708
Before that, all I remember is
my parents died when I was very young.

01:02:44.375 --> 01:02:47.250
Boo-hoo! It's a sob story!

01:02:47.375 --> 01:02:52.333
How about we cheer ourselves up
with a bowl of bear stew?

01:02:52.458 --> 01:02:54.750
- No, we can't eat him...
- Huh?

01:02:55.416 --> 01:02:57.375
- ...yet.
- What?

01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:00.625
(All repeat) What?

01:03:01.791 --> 01:03:05.375
You said something
about... eating someone.

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:08.625
Did I?

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:12.375
Probably it's just... the altitude.

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.250
Oh. Right.

01:03:14.375 --> 01:03:16.583
Shall we get back
to finding Aunt Lucy?

01:03:16.708 --> 01:03:18.375
Yes.

01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:22.875
(Gonzalo) Don't lose your nerve.

01:03:23.541 --> 01:03:25.500
Maybe there is another way.

01:03:25.625 --> 01:03:29.916
We are too close for you to throw it
all away with your stupid feelings.

01:03:30.041 --> 01:03:31.125
Stick to the plan!

01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:36.750
You follow the bear, you find the gold,
you eat bear stew.

01:03:36.875 --> 01:03:40.125
Follow bear! Find gold! Eat stew!

01:03:40.708 --> 01:03:42.333
Bear, gold, stew!

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:50.708
Bear, gold, stew.

01:03:50.833 --> 01:03:52.875
(Paddington) Are you coming,
Mr Hunter?

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.416
Right... right behind you.

01:03:58.666 --> 01:04:03.416
I can see the camp fire. It's not far.
On the other side of the valley.

01:04:04.583 --> 01:04:07.791
But the bridge is down.

01:04:10.083 --> 01:04:11.708
Papa...

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:18.500
How do we feel
about crossing over... that?

01:04:23.458 --> 01:04:25.625
We need a miracle.

01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:31.500
(Aircraft overhead)

01:04:42.916 --> 01:04:46.750
- (Judy) Look, it's Mrs Bird!
- (Jonathan) Yes!

01:05:02.916 --> 01:05:04.791
(Roaring)

01:05:04.916 --> 01:05:08.458
Oh! Hello. Beg your pardon.

01:05:10.958 --> 01:05:12.458
Aunt Lucy!

01:05:22.958 --> 01:05:24.375
(Gasps)

01:05:25.416 --> 01:05:26.875
Oh...

01:05:29.416 --> 01:05:31.250
(Roaring)

01:05:31.375 --> 01:05:32.958
(Echoing roar)

01:05:33.083 --> 01:05:35.083
- (Echoing roar)
- Oh!

01:05:35.666 --> 01:05:37.125
Aunt Lucy!

01:05:41.375 --> 01:05:42.875
(Roaring)

01:05:44.125 --> 01:05:46.083
(Echoing roar)

01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:47.583
Aunt Lucy!

01:05:49.708 --> 01:05:51.125
(Roaring)

01:05:56.333 --> 01:05:58.083
Almost there, Aunt Lucy!

01:05:58.208 --> 01:06:00.166
(Roaring)

01:06:00.291 --> 01:06:01.625
(Echoing roar)

01:06:03.666 --> 01:06:05.125
Aunt Lucy!

01:06:09.291 --> 01:06:11.666
I'm here!

01:06:11.791 --> 01:06:15.833
(Echoing) I'm here! I'm here!

01:06:17.125 --> 01:06:18.833
I'm here!

01:06:19.916 --> 01:06:21.500
I'm here!

01:06:22.458 --> 01:06:23.875
I'm here!

01:06:25.125 --> 01:06:26.708
Aunt Lucy?

01:06:26.833 --> 01:06:28.583
(Echoing) Aunt Lucy?

01:06:28.708 --> 01:06:30.500
Aunt Lucy?

01:06:30.625 --> 01:06:31.833
Huh?

01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:35.333
You mean, all this time...

01:06:36.083 --> 01:06:38.416
...you were just an echo?

01:06:38.541 --> 01:06:41.625
(Echoing) Echo? Echo?

01:06:42.458 --> 01:06:43.666
Echo?

01:06:47.625 --> 01:06:49.041
(Sighs heavily)

01:06:55.625 --> 01:06:57.500
I'm sorry, Aunt Lucy.

01:06:58.333 --> 01:07:02.916
You found me all those years ago,
and now I can't find you.

01:07:05.333 --> 01:07:07.208
We're both lost.

01:07:09.916 --> 01:07:12.416
I don't want to say goodbye.

01:07:15.583 --> 01:07:16.666
(Hunter) So...

01:07:18.208 --> 01:07:21.541
...the bear showed the way.

01:07:21.666 --> 01:07:24.291
- Mr Hunter!
- But if this is El Dorado...

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:28.750
...where is...
where is the gold?

01:07:28.875 --> 01:07:33.291
There is no gold, Mr Hunter.
And no Aunt Lucy.

01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:38.416
There must be something,
some special mechanism,

01:07:38.541 --> 01:07:43.083
that leads you to the... gold.

01:07:45.166 --> 01:07:46.458
A-ha!

01:07:47.541 --> 01:07:50.541
- What did I tell you?
- Oh?

01:07:58.083 --> 01:08:00.958
Strange Inca symbols.

01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:03.291
A triangle.

01:08:04.458 --> 01:08:07.583
A circle with an 'X' through it.

01:08:09.333 --> 01:08:11.583
"Dry clean only"?

01:08:12.708 --> 01:08:15.375
It's a washing label, Mr Hunter.

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:18.332
"Barkridges of Kensington."

01:08:18.457 --> 01:08:21.625
Aunt Lucy's scarf!
She bought this in London.

01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:25.625
Are you... behind this wall?

01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:28.750
Whoa! Oh!

01:08:30.457 --> 01:08:31.875
(Grunts)

01:08:38.791 --> 01:08:41.082
This must open!

01:08:41.207 --> 01:08:42.875
(Groaning)

01:08:43.916 --> 01:08:45.291
Oh?

01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:51.541
(Gonzalo) The bear shows the way.

01:08:51.666 --> 01:08:53.332
Those clever Incas!

01:08:53.457 --> 01:08:57.250
The talisman... it must go in there.

01:08:57.375 --> 01:08:59.291
Take it from him.

01:08:59.416 --> 01:09:00.832
But...

01:09:01.916 --> 01:09:03.500
...it feels wrong.

01:09:03.625 --> 01:09:08.207
Wrong? Five hundred years
of searching for gold is wrong?

01:09:08.332 --> 01:09:13.500
But... I have made a promise to Gina...

01:09:13.625 --> 01:09:16.041
Forget about Gina.

01:09:17.416 --> 01:09:19.666
Take the talisman.

01:09:20.875 --> 01:09:23.166
Kill the bear!

01:09:23.291 --> 01:09:25.375
Give me the talisman!

01:09:26.582 --> 01:09:29.000
Talisman, Mr Hunter?

01:09:29.125 --> 01:09:30.457
Hand it over.

01:09:31.291 --> 01:09:32.625
No.

01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:36.125
I said... hand it over.

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:39.582
Promise we can go in together.

01:09:39.707 --> 01:09:43.125
Well, the thing about that, Bear,

01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:47.582
is that Cabotos don't share!

01:09:51.957 --> 01:09:54.166
(Chuckles)

01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:55.916
An umbrella?

01:09:56.041 --> 01:10:00.166
Not just any brolly.
The Windsorman Deluxe.

01:10:02.541 --> 01:10:04.416
London's finest, Mr Hunter!

01:10:08.416 --> 01:10:09.791
(Gasps)

01:10:09.916 --> 01:10:12.041
Uh... Uh...

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:20.666
Apparently, they bought this plane
for the Pope's visit in 1985.

01:10:20.791 --> 01:10:25.375
- It's got its MOT and everything?
- It's got a papal blessing.

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.375
(Rattling and beeping)

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.000
(Engine dies)

01:10:29.583 --> 01:10:31.083
(Beeping)

01:10:31.208 --> 01:10:32.625
(Engine starts)

01:10:35.291 --> 01:10:37.041
- Look!
- What?

01:10:40.208 --> 01:10:41.541
It's Paddington!

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:46.291
Bear!

01:10:48.625 --> 01:10:50.708
Oh! Spiky Red One!

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.875
- Reverend Mother, can you land?
- It'll be tight.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.500
Yes!

01:10:59.458 --> 01:11:01.958
- Where are you, Bear?
- Oops!

01:11:05.541 --> 01:11:07.875
- (Alarm beeping)
- The landing gear's jammed.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.250
One of you will have to lift
that panel in the floor,

01:11:11.375 --> 01:11:14.250
and turn the manual release.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.708
It's all right, I'll do it.

01:11:19.416 --> 01:11:20.916
(Mrs Brown) Go on, darling!

01:11:23.083 --> 01:11:24.916
Ooh!

01:11:27.541 --> 01:11:30.500
Any-anyone happen to have
a very large tumbler?

01:11:30.625 --> 01:11:32.500
Come on, Henry!

01:11:33.875 --> 01:11:35.541
(Sniffing)

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:37.666
I can smell the marmalade.

01:11:37.791 --> 01:11:39.625
(Sniffing)

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.750
Oh! Hello.

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.750
Sorry, Mr Hunter!

01:12:01.416 --> 01:12:03.083
(Both gasp)

01:12:03.208 --> 01:12:07.041
Hurry up, lad!
We need those wheels out!

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:12.791
(Madison) 'Embrace the risk, Henry.'

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.625
Embrace the risk...

01:12:27.416 --> 01:12:28.416
There you go.

01:12:31.833 --> 01:12:32.666
(All) Dad!

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:37.250
- Be with you in a minute!
- Oh, my goodness!

01:12:37.375 --> 01:12:39.875
- Let me take a photo!
- Forget the photo!

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.375
No, do it! Do it!

01:12:42.625 --> 01:12:43.750
My gosh!

01:12:45.875 --> 01:12:48.000
(Groaning)

01:12:50.583 --> 01:12:52.583
- You did it!
- Oh!

01:12:52.708 --> 01:12:55.000
- (Mrs Brown) Darling, well done!
- (Mr Brown) There you go.

01:12:55.125 --> 01:12:57.125
Home sweet home.

01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:01.625
That was amazing!

01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:04.708
Well done, Mr Brown!
Nothing can go wrong now!

01:13:06.375 --> 01:13:07.875
(Screaming)

01:13:11.333 --> 01:13:12.958
Whoa... Oh!

01:13:15.416 --> 01:13:16.250
Oh.

01:13:17.083 --> 01:13:18.500
Oh!

01:13:18.625 --> 01:13:21.041
- Whoa!
- Bear!

01:13:24.208 --> 01:13:25.208
Huh?

01:13:25.333 --> 01:13:27.666
(Screaming)

01:13:27.791 --> 01:13:30.916
One of these must be
the windscreen wipers.

01:13:31.583 --> 01:13:34.833
(Screaming)

01:13:34.958 --> 01:13:39.041
- Stop pushing buttons!
- I've got an idea!

01:13:39.166 --> 01:13:40.958
- (Mrs Brown) What?
- I'll need back-up.

01:13:43.041 --> 01:13:45.250
- Oh! Oh...
- (Bleating)

01:13:45.833 --> 01:13:47.666
Oh. Hello again.

01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:49.708
- Bear!
- Oh, dear.

01:13:51.375 --> 01:13:57.583
Erm... excuse me, Mr Llama,
could you please... giddy up?

01:13:57.708 --> 01:14:02.458
- Give me the bracelet, Bear!
- Oh... erm... Ah!

01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:06.916
Ma-llama-lade.

01:14:07.708 --> 01:14:09.583
Hmm?

01:14:11.291 --> 01:14:12.625
(Jonathan) Hold me up!

01:14:14.083 --> 01:14:15.166
- Left a bit!
- Come on!

01:14:16.416 --> 01:14:18.708
- No! My left!
- Which left?

01:14:18.833 --> 01:14:20.166
- That left!
- That way?

01:14:20.291 --> 01:14:21.125
This left!

01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:23.166
Huh?

01:14:24.666 --> 01:14:28.416
Yes! Here we go.
Thank you. And this way!

01:14:28.541 --> 01:14:31.958
And I think it's up here.
Thank you.

01:14:33.083 --> 01:14:36.166
- Just round this corner...
- I need that bracelet!

01:14:37.541 --> 01:14:38.875
I'm coming, Aunt Lucy!

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.208
Huh? Not you again?

01:14:43.333 --> 01:14:45.083
- Yes!
- (Screaming)

01:14:48.166 --> 01:14:49.125
Well done!

01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:56.375
Gangway!

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:05.833
(Sighs)

01:15:07.333 --> 01:15:09.833
- That was close.
- (Cracking)

01:15:09.958 --> 01:15:11.958
Oh...

01:15:12.083 --> 01:15:13.833
Extremely close.

01:15:14.833 --> 01:15:16.583
- Thank God!
- (Mr Brown) Well done, Jonathan!

01:15:16.708 --> 01:15:19.708
- Here we go! Brace positions!
- Okay.

01:15:22.041 --> 01:15:26.250
You really don't seem yourself,
Mr Hunter.

01:15:26.375 --> 01:15:28.958
I am Gonzalo Caboto!

01:15:29.083 --> 01:15:31.458
- And I want my...

01:15:31.583 --> 01:15:35.250
♪ Onward Christian soldiers

01:15:35.375 --> 01:15:37.958
- ♪ Marching as to war

01:15:38.083 --> 01:15:42.541
- ♪ With the cross of Jesus... ♪

01:15:42.666 --> 01:15:44.666
Oh, we've landed!

01:15:49.333 --> 01:15:51.333
(All) Whoa!

01:16:03.833 --> 01:16:05.666
(Groaning)

01:16:07.083 --> 01:16:09.166
(All) Ooh...

01:16:23.416 --> 01:16:25.250
(Gasps)

01:16:26.208 --> 01:16:27.291
Hmm?

01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:35.125
You looked like you enjoyed that!

01:16:35.250 --> 01:16:38.250
Oh! Oh, it's just so nice to...

01:16:39.166 --> 01:16:42.166
...all be on the same sofa again.

01:16:43.875 --> 01:16:46.416
(Mrs Bird) Well done,
Reverend Mother.

01:16:46.541 --> 01:16:48.541
Well done.

01:16:49.291 --> 01:16:52.083
(Mr Brown) Right, come on.
Out you go.

01:16:52.208 --> 01:16:54.958
We can all sing a hymn of thanks,
once we find Aunt Lucy.

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:06.750
- Paddington!
- Mrs Brown!

01:17:06.875 --> 01:17:09.458
- Oh, Paddington!
- Paddington!

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:13.416
(Mr Brown) Oh!

01:17:13.541 --> 01:17:16.916
- I'm so happy to see you all.
- Thank goodness you're all right.

01:17:18.125 --> 01:17:20.708
- I knew this would come in handy.
- (Groaning)

01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:23.916
I know where Aunt Lucy is.

01:17:24.666 --> 01:17:27.333
She's somewhere behind this.

01:17:28.125 --> 01:17:30.791
And I think I know how to open it.

01:17:30.916 --> 01:17:34.708
Clever little bear.
I was rather hoping you would.

01:17:34.833 --> 01:17:36.041
Reverend Mother?

01:17:40.041 --> 01:17:41.166
Oh!

01:17:41.291 --> 01:17:45.083
- What on earth are you doing?
- Why, same as everyone else, my dear.

01:17:45.208 --> 01:17:46.916
Looking for gold.

01:17:47.041 --> 01:17:50.875
So, thank you very much for leading me
straight to it, as I knew you would.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.083
- This is a bit unchristian, isn't it?
- Well, it would be...

01:17:55.208 --> 01:17:57.541
...if I were really a nun.

01:18:01.791 --> 01:18:03.833
- Oh!
- Ooh! Oh, crikey.

01:18:05.375 --> 01:18:07.375
(Hunter) Clarissa?

01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:11.083
Cousin Clarissa?

01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:15.833
But you are dead.
You died in the jungle.

01:18:15.958 --> 01:18:19.083
- They're related?
- And you went to find yourself...?

01:18:19.208 --> 01:18:22.000
No, I went to find gold!

01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:24.333
'And I never stopped looking.

01:18:24.458 --> 01:18:28.250
'And when I found out it had something
to do with bears, I did the obvious thing.

01:18:28.375 --> 01:18:32.375
'I disguised myself as a nun, and got a job
at the Home for Retired Bears.'

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:35.000
Hello!
I'm your new Reverend Mother!

01:18:35.583 --> 01:18:37.500
Not that obvious.

01:18:37.625 --> 01:18:41.500
Years I was stuck there
with those mangy furbags.

01:18:41.625 --> 01:18:42.875
How rude.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Until one day,
Aunt Lucy showed me that bracelet.

01:18:47.125 --> 01:18:50.875
'And I knew that you would be the one
to lead me to El Dorado.'

01:18:52.166 --> 01:18:55.208
- Why me?
- Oh, she never told you?

01:18:55.333 --> 01:18:57.750
- It's your bracelet, Paddington.
- Oh?

01:18:57.875 --> 01:19:00.500
It was round your ankle
when she pulled you out of that river.

01:19:00.625 --> 01:19:01.958
Hmm...

01:19:02.083 --> 01:19:05.666
I knew if anyone was gonna
show me the way, it would be you.

01:19:05.791 --> 01:19:09.458
So, I lured you to Peru, and I arranged
for your aunt's disappearance.

01:19:09.583 --> 01:19:11.791
(Gasps) Reverend Mother?

01:19:12.958 --> 01:19:17.875
Reverend Mother, I can't see you.
I-I can't see anything!

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.166
(Reverend Mother) 'I knew you'd
never rest until you found Aunt Lucy.

01:19:21.291 --> 01:19:23.166
'So, with a little help from me...

01:19:23.916 --> 01:19:25.500
'"Dear Paddington.

01:19:25.625 --> 01:19:31.166
'"I'm afraid I have some rather
worrying news about your Aunt Lucy.

01:19:31.291 --> 01:19:33.291
'"Please don't mention that I wrote.

01:19:33.416 --> 01:19:36.583
'"She wouldn't want you bothered
by such things."'

01:19:36.708 --> 01:19:38.583
You led me right here.

01:19:38.708 --> 01:19:42.250
So, please, give me that talisman.
Thank you.

01:19:42.375 --> 01:19:45.250
Oh, I don't seem to have it.

01:19:46.875 --> 01:19:50.083
- I really don't.
- Well, then, who has?

01:19:57.166 --> 01:20:01.708
- Hand it over, or I shoot.
- With great-grandpa's musket?

01:20:01.833 --> 01:20:04.791
That thing is over a hundred years old.
It won't even work.

01:20:04.916 --> 01:20:06.791
Shall we put it to the test?

01:20:10.791 --> 01:20:11.875
(All) Gina!

01:20:13.458 --> 01:20:15.000
(Hunter gasps)

01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:19.791
She means it.
And she's very strong for a nun.

01:20:19.916 --> 01:20:22.250
She's not a nun!

01:20:22.375 --> 01:20:24.541
The gold or your daughter?

01:20:24.666 --> 01:20:27.333
You're all family.
Couldn't you just share the gold?

01:20:27.458 --> 01:20:29.750
Cabotos don't share!

01:20:31.250 --> 01:20:33.666
- Sorry, it was just a thought.
- It was a very good one.

01:20:33.791 --> 01:20:35.625
Papa, please!

01:20:38.291 --> 01:20:42.375
But I am so close.
I cannot lose it now.

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:47.416
I have been searching forever
in this... sweaty jungle,

01:20:47.541 --> 01:20:53.875
and I am hot and flushed
and-and-and uncomfortable, and...

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:04.500
Why do I feel so...

01:21:07.125 --> 01:21:08.375
...queasy?

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:12.000
It's called a hard stare, Mr Hunter.

01:21:12.125 --> 01:21:16.666
And it's for when people have forgotten
their manners and the important things.

01:21:18.833 --> 01:21:22.000
- Yeah...
- Gina's your treasure.

01:21:22.125 --> 01:21:24.791
Don't lose her because of gold.

01:21:30.291 --> 01:21:32.375
Gina will steal the gold for herself.

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:35.250
- Choose the gold!
- You can always get a new daughter.

01:21:35.375 --> 01:21:37.166
Cabotos don't share!

01:21:40.583 --> 01:21:42.666
I'm sorry, Gina.

01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:54.833
All I can say is, er...

01:21:56.541 --> 01:21:58.458
- ...boom.
- Boom?

01:21:58.583 --> 01:21:59.541
Boom!

01:22:07.541 --> 01:22:10.791
- Oh! (Giggling)
- Huh...

01:22:10.916 --> 01:22:12.916
Oh, dear... What?

01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:17.250
- No, no, no!
- Papa!

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.166
Here. Here...

01:22:26.916 --> 01:22:29.000
You're free.

01:22:29.125 --> 01:22:31.125
We are free.

01:22:49.583 --> 01:22:53.875
Go... and find your Aunt Lucy.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.875
You're not coming, Mr Hunter?

01:22:58.625 --> 01:23:00.625
Mr Paddington, um...

01:23:01.833 --> 01:23:04.833
...I've got all the treasure I need.

01:23:08.166 --> 01:23:09.833
Thank you, Mr Hunter.

01:23:11.416 --> 01:23:14.583
Oh, no... thank you.

01:23:16.875 --> 01:23:18.291
Mmm...

01:23:33.125 --> 01:23:36.791
Um... I'll just try that again.

01:23:37.708 --> 01:23:39.125
(Blows)

01:23:44.458 --> 01:23:48.541
- (Low rumbling)
- Huh?

01:23:50.208 --> 01:23:53.541
- (Mrs Bird) What's happening?
- (Mrs Brown) Whoa!

01:23:53.666 --> 01:23:57.583
- (Mrs Bird) It's opening! It's opening!
- What's happening? Oh, my goodness!

01:23:57.708 --> 01:23:59.791
(Mrs Bird) Back! Back!

01:24:16.583 --> 01:24:19.000
(Mrs Bird) Oh! Oh, my...

01:24:19.125 --> 01:24:21.458
- Oh, it's the...
- It's... it's from the book, the weird...

01:24:21.583 --> 01:24:24.666
- Yes, the "Espiritus del Bosque".
- (Judy) The forest spirits...

01:24:24.791 --> 01:24:26.625
- (Mrs Brown) Yes.
- (Judy) They're real.

01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:28.416
Oh!

01:24:28.541 --> 01:24:31.166
- (Roaring)
- Oh!

01:24:31.291 --> 01:24:32.833
They don't sound friendly.

01:24:34.583 --> 01:24:36.833
Quite the opposite, Mr Brown.

01:24:37.708 --> 01:24:40.500
That was my bear name.

01:24:41.250 --> 01:24:42.833
Oh...

01:24:45.166 --> 01:24:48.416
- They want us to go inside.
- Really?

01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:51.916
Thank you. Afternoon.

01:24:53.125 --> 01:24:54.958
Thank you so much.

01:25:12.625 --> 01:25:17.958
Could this be...
could it be El Dorado?

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:31.666
Oranges.

01:25:31.791 --> 01:25:33.875
Thousands of oranges.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.583
Juicy ones, at that!

01:25:36.708 --> 01:25:42.833
Oh... they're beautiful, perfect,
every one.

01:25:42.958 --> 01:25:45.416
But what about the gold?

01:25:45.541 --> 01:25:48.000
I think we're looking at it.

01:25:48.125 --> 01:25:51.125
The gold is oranges.

01:25:52.958 --> 01:25:56.458
El Dorado is an orange grove!

01:25:59.708 --> 01:26:02.250
- Oh...
- Oh! Oh!

01:26:02.375 --> 01:26:03.583
- Hello, again.
- Hello.

01:26:05.708 --> 01:26:08.125
- (Mr Brown) Oh?
- (Mrs Brown) Oh, look!

01:26:08.250 --> 01:26:09.833
(Growling)

01:26:10.833 --> 01:26:12.500
(Growling)

01:26:12.625 --> 01:26:15.291
- (Mr Brown) And...?
- Hi!

01:26:15.416 --> 01:26:17.416
They're bears.

01:26:23.416 --> 01:26:24.916
(Gasps)

01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:27.666
(Roaring)

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:30.750
- (Answering roar)
- Oh!

01:26:40.708 --> 01:26:42.708
Aunt Lucy!

01:26:43.583 --> 01:26:46.125
Ooh! Paddington?

01:26:51.833 --> 01:26:54.250
Oh, Paddington!

01:26:56.083 --> 01:26:57.916
Aunt Lucy.

01:27:03.041 --> 01:27:06.500
I always knew you'd come for me.

01:27:06.625 --> 01:27:08.416
- You'll be needing these.
- Oh!

01:27:09.416 --> 01:27:11.875
Oh... Oh, my, my...

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.291
Quite the rescue party!

01:27:14.416 --> 01:27:16.833
We're so pleased you're safe.

01:27:16.958 --> 01:27:19.583
All thanks to these bears.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.250
They heard my roars and rescued me.

01:27:24.375 --> 01:27:30.000
- Who are they, Aunt Lucy?
- And why do they dress up like... trees?

01:27:30.625 --> 01:27:32.791
To stay hidden.

01:27:32.916 --> 01:27:38.083
They are the secret guardians
of the El Dorado oranges.

01:27:38.208 --> 01:27:40.541
They know my bear name.

01:27:40.666 --> 01:27:45.041
And I've been dreaming
about that statue.

01:27:45.166 --> 01:27:47.166
Help me up.

01:27:48.708 --> 01:27:54.833
All those years ago, when Uncle Pastuzo
and I found you as a cub,

01:27:54.958 --> 01:27:58.416
you told us you were orphaned.

01:27:58.541 --> 01:28:02.375
But we always wanted to know
where you came from.

01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:08.291
The answer was here all the time.

01:28:08.416 --> 01:28:11.166
Your bracelet.

01:28:11.291 --> 01:28:14.125
All the cubs here have them.

01:28:14.250 --> 01:28:16.500
So, if they get lost...

01:28:16.625 --> 01:28:19.458
They can find their way home.

01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:24.083
(Aunt Lucy) They are your tribe.

01:28:25.416 --> 01:28:29.625
You are an El Dorado bear.

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:34.083
I think... I remember.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.916
Uh... argh!

01:28:42.041 --> 01:28:43.875
(Screaming)

01:28:46.375 --> 01:28:48.250
I got lost.

01:28:48.375 --> 01:28:53.708
In finding me,
you have found yourself.

01:29:04.375 --> 01:29:05.791
Oh...

01:29:08.916 --> 01:29:10.916
(Soft growling)

01:29:15.166 --> 01:29:17.958
What do you think they're saying?

01:29:18.083 --> 01:29:22.458
I think they're just...
happy to have him home.

01:29:26.083 --> 01:29:28.916
Would you mind taking these for me,
Mrs Brown?

01:29:29.708 --> 01:29:33.750
There's something I think
my tribe might enjoy.

01:29:33.875 --> 01:29:36.291
And I may need Jonathan's help.

01:30:02.916 --> 01:30:06.958
With oranges this wonderful,
you have to make marmalade.

01:30:08.583 --> 01:30:10.666
More sugar, please!

01:30:16.333 --> 01:30:18.333
He looks so happy.

01:30:19.458 --> 01:30:21.458
Like he never left.

01:30:21.583 --> 01:30:23.041
Now, Mary...

01:30:24.041 --> 01:30:27.958
It's all right...
it's how it's meant to be.

01:30:30.333 --> 01:30:33.750
- Paddington belongs here.
- With his clan.

01:30:53.625 --> 01:30:56.875
(Paddington) 'Hello.
Coming down in stair rods, isn't it?'

01:30:57.458 --> 01:30:59.083
Good evening.

01:31:03.541 --> 01:31:07.750
(Mrs Brown) I hope you don't mind me asking,
but shouldn't you be at home?

01:31:07.875 --> 01:31:12.833
Oh, yes, I should, but I haven't quite
worked out how to find one.

01:31:21.541 --> 01:31:23.958
I didn't realise it was this difficult.

01:31:24.083 --> 01:31:25.500
Oh...

01:31:28.375 --> 01:31:31.625
It's just what happens next.

01:31:35.416 --> 01:31:36.500
This one's for you.

01:31:39.083 --> 01:31:42.208
Thank you, Paddington. Gosh!

01:31:42.333 --> 01:31:45.583
No... thank you for...

01:31:46.666 --> 01:31:49.083
...well, for everything
you've done for me.

01:31:49.208 --> 01:31:50.875
And, um...

01:31:51.833 --> 01:31:55.166
...there's something I wanted to ask.

01:31:55.833 --> 01:32:00.250
You were all so kind to take me in
all that time ago.

01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:02.333
I know it couldn't have been easy,

01:32:02.458 --> 01:32:04.958
and that I've sometimes been
a bit of a nuisance.

01:32:05.083 --> 01:32:09.500
Sorry about that business with your pyjamas
in the paper shredder, Mr Brown.

01:32:09.625 --> 01:32:12.291
That's all right, Paddington.

01:32:13.041 --> 01:32:18.458
So, I wanted to ask,
if you didn't mind terribly...

01:32:19.708 --> 01:32:22.541
...if, um...

01:32:26.166 --> 01:32:29.208
...if I, um...

01:32:30.416 --> 01:32:31.916
Yes, Paddington?

01:32:32.791 --> 01:32:34.208
Um...

01:32:35.166 --> 01:32:37.708
...if I could stay.

01:32:39.833 --> 01:32:41.083
Mmm...

01:32:42.291 --> 01:32:43.958
With you.

01:32:44.083 --> 01:32:45.583
If I could come back home.

01:32:47.833 --> 01:32:50.500
Come back home with...? Oh!

01:32:50.625 --> 01:32:54.750
Yes, of course you can, Paddington!
You don't have to ask that.

01:32:54.875 --> 01:32:58.750
Oh, I thought you were going
to ask to stay here.

01:32:58.875 --> 01:33:03.125
Mrs Brown... they are my tribe.

01:33:03.916 --> 01:33:05.875
But you are my family.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:10.916
This is where I'm from,
but... you're where I belong.

01:33:11.041 --> 01:33:13.458
- Oh.
- (Chuckling)

01:33:22.375 --> 01:33:26.416
You think to press the red button?
Yeah... yes., that's right.

01:33:26.541 --> 01:33:28.125
(Paddington) 'Dear Aunt Lucy.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.166
'I hope you're still enjoying life

01:33:33.291 --> 01:33:36.625
'It seems a long time since our holiday
together in the valley,

01:33:36.750 --> 01:33:39.375
'and everyone's lives
have changed so much.

'And it was nice of the church
to forgive Clarissa Cabot,

'providing she became a real nun...'

01:33:47.166 --> 01:33:49.666
- Out.
- Are you sure this is the place?

01:33:51.125 --> 01:33:53.708
(Paddington) '...and took a new posting.'

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.958
(Wailing)

Jonathan has given up chillin',

dangerous mission...

has been promoted at work,

...finally, with the purple-kneed tarantula
on my face.

01:34:38.125 --> 01:34:41.708
So, as you can see,
some risks are worth embracing.

01:34:41.833 --> 01:34:46.250
But only if they're for the greater good,
and for the people you love.

01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:49.708
- Thank you.
- Outstanding.

01:34:49.833 --> 01:34:51.791
- Sensational.
- Awesome.

01:34:51.916 --> 01:34:55.833
On that note, I will be doing
a sponsored BASE jump

01:34:55.958 --> 01:34:58.333
for the Home for Retired Bears.

01:34:58.458 --> 01:35:01.458
So, please chip in.

01:35:01.583 --> 01:35:04.250
And remember, embrace the risk!

this could make the front page.

Thank you.

Do any of your friends
care for the theatre?

01:38:46.708 --> 01:38:49.208
Perhaps some of them
like to perform?

I am shortly to be released,

I am thinking the autumn, I am thinking
a small theatre, the Wyndham, the Duchess.

01:39:21.541 --> 01:39:23.041
And I am thinking
we may need some money.

01:39:23.166 --> 01:39:26.250
You who've been to El Dorado.
Did you, by any chance, find any?

01:39:26.375 --> 01:39:29.375
- (Paddington) We found these...
- (All grunting)

01:39:31.291 --> 01:39:32.708
Oranges?

01:39:33.958 --> 01:39:35.541
That is disappointing.
