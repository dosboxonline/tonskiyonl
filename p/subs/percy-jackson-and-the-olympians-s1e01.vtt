00:06.416 --> 00:09.791
<i>Look, I didn't want to be
a half-blood.</i>

00:12.208 --> 00:15.833
<i>Being a half-blood is dangerous.
It's scary.</i>

00:17.166 --> 00:22.708
<i>Most of the time it gets you killed,
in painful, nasty ways.</i>

00:25.333 --> 00:29.041
<i>If you think you might be one of us,
my advice is</i>

00:29.291 --> 00:30.958
<i>turn away while you still can,</i>

00:32.000 --> 00:33.458
<i>because once you know what you are...</i>

00:35.166 --> 00:38.500
<i>they'll sense it too
and they'll come for you.</i>

00:40.625 --> 00:42.750
<i>Don't say I didn't warn you.</i>

00:54.125 --> 00:57.250
<i>My name is Percy Jackson.
I'm twelve years old.</i>

00:58.541 --> 01:00.125
<i>Am I a troubled kid?</i>

01:02.250 --> 01:04.041
<i>Yeah, you could say that.</i>

01:05.166 --> 01:08.291
<i>Bad grades, bullies, all the normal stuff.</i>

01:10.541 --> 01:12.375
<i>And then there's some other stuff.</i>

01:13.958 --> 01:16.791
<i>Some stuff
that's... maybe not so normal.</i>

01:27.916 --> 01:32.458
<i>That's me, back in second grade.
Why was I up there?</i>

01:33.833 --> 01:35.041
<i>I saw something.</i>

01:36.500 --> 01:40.458
<i>At least... I could have sworn
I saw something.</i>

01:44.791 --> 01:46.375
<i>When you say
you something like that,</i>

01:46.375 --> 01:48.333
<i>you wind up in this guy's office.</i>

01:48.958 --> 01:52.375
<i>Good news, he's saying
there's nothing to worry about.</i>

01:53.166 --> 01:55.125
<i>It's all in my imagination,</i>

01:55.791 --> 01:58.291
<i>but if it happens again,
make sure to tell someone.</i>

02:02.125 --> 02:03.250
<i>It happened again.</i>

02:04.875 --> 02:07.625
<i>These impossible things
that felt like they walked</i>

02:07.750 --> 02:09.791
<i>right out of the stories
my mom always told me.</i>

02:10.833 --> 02:14.458
<i>So real one minute, and then the next...</i>

02:16.125 --> 02:17.416
What a loser.

02:18.458 --> 02:21.500
<i>Hey, fellas, wanna come hear
about the imaginary stuff I see?</i>

02:22.166 --> 02:25.250
<i>It's not a thing
you wanna be saying, to anyone,</i>

02:25.875 --> 02:26.916
<i>so I didn't.</i>

02:28.291 --> 02:31.000
<i>Then... something changed.</i>

02:34.000 --> 02:35.208
<i>I met Grover.</i>

02:36.125 --> 02:37.791
<i>We had a lot in common.</i>

02:37.916 --> 02:39.500
Only he--

02:39.625 --> 02:40.833
Mm-mm.

02:43.083 --> 02:46.041
<i>And not just because we were both
at the bottom of the food chain.</i>

02:47.041 --> 02:48.125
<i>And you know what?</i>

02:48.125 --> 02:50.666
<i>It felt good to talk about these things
with Grover.</i>

02:50.958 --> 02:53.166
<i>I could almost believe
they were imaginary.</i>

02:53.791 --> 02:56.208
<i>Weird, but harmless.</i>

02:58.708 --> 03:00.458
<i>Until the day that changed, too.</i>

03:03.666 --> 03:06.125
<i>Until the day one of them decided
to come for me.</i>

03:15.791 --> 03:19.666
What you see here,
they are not fictions.

03:20.750 --> 03:22.916
They are not fantasies.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.833
What you see here are the truest
and deepest parts of yourselves.

03:32.208 --> 03:33.208
Friends...

03:34.416 --> 03:35.666
the gods...

03:36.625 --> 03:39.541
the monsters, the heroes

03:39.958 --> 03:41.833
you see here in this room

03:42.833 --> 03:46.541
are reminders of what we are capable of.

03:47.875 --> 03:49.708
Now, on your worksheets,

03:49.833 --> 03:53.750
I want you to choose one of the subjects
you see here

03:54.291 --> 03:56.000
and describe it.

03:56.708 --> 03:58.833
Not just how it looks...

04:01.041 --> 04:02.666
but how it makes you feel.

04:03.750 --> 04:05.500
Hmm? Okay, come on.

04:15.708 --> 04:16.750
<i>What do you see?</i>

04:21.125 --> 04:22.333
<i>Perseus...</i>

04:24.041 --> 04:25.125
that's me.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.875
Mm-hmm,
that's who you're named after.

04:30.083 --> 04:31.708
Is that why you named me after him?

04:33.125 --> 04:34.541
Because he was a hero?

04:35.166 --> 04:37.083
What makes you think he was a hero?

04:38.625 --> 04:40.250
Because he kills monsters.

04:41.416 --> 04:43.958
And what makes you think
that she was a monster?

04:44.583 --> 04:45.583
Mom...

04:47.250 --> 04:49.958
Not everyone
who looks like a hero is a hero,

04:50.500 --> 04:53.666
and not everyone who looks
like a monster is a monster.

04:54.416 --> 04:59.166
I named you after him
because when he was a very little boy,

04:59.625 --> 05:02.166
he and his mother were placed
in a wooden chest

05:02.291 --> 05:06.125
and cast out into the sea
by a very angry king.

05:06.583 --> 05:12.500
Alone, afraid. And at night, his mother
would whisper in his ear,

05:13.250 --> 05:15.583
"Hold fast, Perseus."

05:16.041 --> 05:21.291
"Brave the storm that was made
to break us for we are unbreakable

05:21.416 --> 05:23.166
"as long as we have each other."

05:24.708 --> 05:27.583
And against all odds,

05:27.583 --> 05:31.500
he managed to find his way
to a happy ending.

05:36.916 --> 05:38.291
Percy?

05:38.416 --> 05:39.708
Mom?

05:40.083 --> 05:44.708
I'm right here, sweetie! Mommy's here!

05:45.125 --> 05:46.333
Mr. Jackson,

05:47.000 --> 05:49.458
you will learn to control yourself,
do you understand me?

05:49.583 --> 05:51.750
- Me?
- Do you understand me?

05:51.875 --> 05:55.583
He can't help it, Mrs. Dodds.
Percy's special.

05:55.708 --> 05:58.083
That's enough.

06:01.250 --> 06:02.750
Pay them no mind.

06:05.083 --> 06:06.291
When you're ready to hear

06:06.541 --> 06:09.833
what the gods have in store for you,
they'll tell you.

06:11.041 --> 06:12.041
I believe in you.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.208
And I believe you'll be needing this.

06:16.458 --> 06:18.333
Hmm?

06:19.083 --> 06:20.166
Hang on to that.

06:20.958 --> 06:22.458
'Tis a mighty instrument.

06:33.916 --> 06:36.750
There are all sorts of schools of thought
about what drives that kind of bullying.

06:36.875 --> 06:39.041
Childhood trauma,
feelings of inadequacy...

06:39.208 --> 06:41.083
Look, I get that Nancy has issues,

06:41.083 --> 06:43.291
I'm just getting tired
of her taking them out on me.

06:44.083 --> 06:47.625
I feel like... maybe it's time
to do something about it.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.958
You could make an appointment
to see Mr. Kane.

06:49.958 --> 06:52.416
- He's really good at talking--
- I was thinking more like shoving Nancy

06:52.541 --> 06:53.666
in the nearest dumpster.

06:54.791 --> 06:55.791
Oh.

06:55.791 --> 06:59.083
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:59.208 --> 07:01.208
No, if there's one thing
I know about bullies,

07:01.375 --> 07:03.625
it is that you should never,
ever stand up to them.

07:04.708 --> 07:06.041
That doesn't sound right.

07:07.541 --> 07:08.541
Look...

07:09.250 --> 07:11.208
I know this place is hard
for people like us.

07:11.833 --> 07:13.375
But we're not gonna be here forever.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.208
There are better places out there.

07:16.791 --> 07:18.625
Oops.

07:20.750 --> 07:21.750
Percy...

07:22.916 --> 07:23.916
No, don't!

07:28.916 --> 07:30.583
Percy pushed me!

07:30.708 --> 07:32.916
- Nancy, are you okay?
- He just pushed Nancy!

07:40.416 --> 07:43.291
<i>There you are.</i>

07:44.250 --> 07:47.833
<i>We're not fools, Percy Jackson.</i>

07:48.416 --> 07:50.916
Mrs. Dodds, you okay?

07:51.875 --> 07:55.375
<i>It was only a matter of time
before we found you.</i>

08:03.125 --> 08:06.708
<i>Where is it, half-blood?</i>

08:07.458 --> 08:09.583
<i>Where is it?</i>

08:31.125 --> 08:32.833
- Is he okay?
- Is he dead?

08:35.166 --> 08:37.708
Give him some room, please.

08:41.041 --> 08:42.208
What happened?

08:43.708 --> 08:44.958
Where's Mrs. Dodds?

08:45.208 --> 08:47.041
I didn't do anything to him!

08:47.416 --> 08:49.500
- He pushed me.
- Everyone, go back to your lunches.

08:49.833 --> 08:52.083
It's all right.
Percy just needs a moment, that's all.

08:53.416 --> 08:55.958
I don't understand.
Didn't anyone just see that?

08:55.958 --> 08:58.375
Where's Mrs. Dodds?

09:01.166 --> 09:04.916
Percy, there's no one here by that name.

09:07.458 --> 09:11.291
All right, class, let's move along.
Let's go. Finish your lunch.

09:16.375 --> 09:20.541
<i>The truth...
can be so very hard to determine...</i>

09:21.958 --> 09:25.500
but in this case,
the truth seems very hard to deny.

09:27.375 --> 09:28.666
Mr. Jackson,

09:29.000 --> 09:32.208
a number of your classmates saw you
and Mr. Underwood

09:32.416 --> 09:34.250
arguing with Ms. Bobofit,

09:34.625 --> 09:38.625
yet you have offered no explanation
for how she ended up in that fountain,

09:39.208 --> 09:40.541
other than, uh...

09:42.916 --> 09:44.750
"I didn't touch Nancy."

09:46.666 --> 09:51.250
Now, isn't there anything else
you'd like to say for yourself?

09:53.833 --> 09:55.416
I didn't touch Nancy.

09:57.583 --> 09:58.916
Okay.

10:00.208 --> 10:03.500
Mr. Underwood?
Do you have anything to add?

10:08.916 --> 10:10.000
Yes.

10:11.708 --> 10:12.708
I do.

10:13.083 --> 10:15.333
Go on.

10:17.958 --> 10:21.541
Percy had told me earlier in the day
that he wanted to get back at Nancy

10:21.541 --> 10:23.541
- for all she'd done to us.
- Grover?

10:24.000 --> 10:26.375
And he isn't being truthful
about what happened at the fountain.

10:26.375 --> 10:27.875
- Grover!
- Excuse me.

10:28.125 --> 10:32.416
Are you saying you saw
Mr. Jackson assault Ms. Bobofit?

10:40.291 --> 10:41.291
Yes,

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
I did.

10:52.375 --> 10:53.791
None of this is easy.

10:55.708 --> 10:56.708
Not for you,

10:57.500 --> 10:58.583
not for any of us.

10:59.541 --> 11:01.416
I'm very concerned about you, Percy.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.750
I saw what happened at the museum.

11:03.875 --> 11:05.916
I didn't touch Nancy.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.958
I know you didn't.

11:09.833 --> 11:13.666
At least, I know you think you didn't.

11:16.250 --> 11:19.166
Do you want to tell me
what you think did happen?

11:19.958 --> 11:23.333
You can tell me. I might just understand.

11:23.666 --> 11:24.791
You wanna bet?

11:25.416 --> 11:27.208
Percy...

11:28.625 --> 11:32.791
I've seen a lot of young people
go through this sort of thing in my time,

11:33.875 --> 11:36.250
but of all of them, I suspect that...

11:37.458 --> 11:39.791
you might have the most difficult journey.

11:40.625 --> 11:43.875
I suspect you are special.

11:44.500 --> 11:48.541
- So much more so than you know.
- Just... stop.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.833
Okay? I don't need any more stories

11:51.958 --> 11:54.541
about how special I don't realize I am.

11:54.875 --> 11:55.916
They aren't helping.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.208
This is my ride. I'm going home.

12:18.625 --> 12:21.083
There's nothing wrong
with the plumbing in this building.

12:21.458 --> 12:22.750
Maybe you should see a doctor.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.458
How do you know
I'm not a doctor, huh?

12:24.458 --> 12:26.333
Have you considered
eating more fruit?

12:26.458 --> 12:30.541
Hey! I eat plenty of fruit.
Have you considered eating more fruit?

12:33.833 --> 12:35.750
Oh! Hello, Percy.

12:36.583 --> 12:38.333
Hey, Eddie, sorry about that.

12:38.916 --> 12:43.083
I'm walking out, you're walking in.
I should be apologizing to you.

12:53.958 --> 12:56.791
W-- Hell, hello.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.333
Welcome home, genius.

13:01.583 --> 13:02.791
Is my mom home from work?

13:02.791 --> 13:04.958
Oh, is that all you got to say to me? Huh?

13:05.583 --> 13:08.708
- After failing out of school?
- I didn't fail out of school.

13:08.833 --> 13:10.958
Your principal called,
and that's what he said.

13:11.125 --> 13:12.375
He said you got kicked out.

13:13.333 --> 13:14.666
They called Mom's cell.

13:15.458 --> 13:18.333
- You answer Mom's cell?
- I answer whatever's ringing.

13:19.791 --> 13:21.791
So, what'd you get kicked out for, hmm?

13:22.583 --> 13:24.750
He said I attacked a kid
on a field trip.

13:27.125 --> 13:28.125
Okay.

13:28.750 --> 13:32.000
All right, if... But still,
if you're gonna live under my roof,

13:32.833 --> 13:34.833
- you gotta live by my rules.
- Your roof?

13:34.958 --> 13:37.791
- My mom is the only one employed here.
- Excuse me?

13:38.500 --> 13:41.500
I have a job. What does it look like
I'm doing right now?

13:42.041 --> 13:43.958
Losing at imaginary poker.

13:44.333 --> 13:46.375
You would think that
because you're a child,

13:46.500 --> 13:48.916
- and you don't understand things like--
- Where's my mom?

13:49.125 --> 13:50.125
I don't know.

13:50.250 --> 13:52.875
I don't know where your mom is.
I'm not Nostradamus.

13:53.250 --> 13:56.041
What are we doing, Percy? Every time!

13:57.083 --> 13:59.333
Wow! Wow!

14:07.500 --> 14:09.875
<i>♪ But now the current's stronger ♪</i>

14:10.333 --> 14:15.666
<i>♪ No, I couldn't get out if I tried
but you convinced me, baby ♪</i>

14:15.791 --> 14:18.041
<i>♪ It was all in my mind ♪</i>

14:18.333 --> 14:19.666
Mom...

14:22.791 --> 14:25.708
I'm really sorry. I tried this time.
You know how hard I've been trying,

14:25.708 --> 14:29.250
but this time, it really wasn't my fault.
It really wasn't my fault.

14:29.750 --> 14:30.833
<i>♪ 'Cause if rain don't pour... ♪</i>

14:30.833 --> 14:32.041
I'm all wet now.

14:32.583 --> 14:35.041
I'm sorry.
I'm just very glad to see you.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.083
I found Gabe on the phone
with the headmaster,

14:38.250 --> 14:40.625
he told me what he thinks happened
with Nancy Bobofit.

14:41.250 --> 14:44.041
I told him I believe my kid.
It was a real short call.

14:45.791 --> 14:48.750
Hey, all that matters
is that you're here, okay?

14:49.666 --> 14:52.291
And that I had enough time...

14:53.458 --> 14:55.250
to pick up your welcome home gift.

15:04.666 --> 15:08.125
Mr. Brunner called me, too.
He told me about Grover.

15:09.791 --> 15:10.958
Do you wanna talk about it?

15:15.333 --> 15:17.833
Is there something else
you wanna talk about?

15:21.500 --> 15:28.125
Something happened to me.
Something has been happening to me.

15:29.041 --> 15:33.291
More than just my mind wandering
and it got worse and...

15:36.166 --> 15:37.250
I'm scared.

15:40.958 --> 15:42.791
- Gabe?
- Mom?

15:45.000 --> 15:47.458
I don't know how anyone expects me

15:47.583 --> 15:50.625
- to get any work done--
- Percy and I are leaving for Montauk.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.416
I'll... I'll have the car back
by Sunday morning.

15:52.416 --> 15:54.708
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Since when are you going to Montauk?

15:54.708 --> 15:58.166
I called to reserve the place
as soon as I got off the phone with Yancy.

15:58.583 --> 15:59.583
Who's Yancy?

16:00.500 --> 16:01.500
The school.

16:02.833 --> 16:03.833
Okay.

16:05.041 --> 16:10.625
- And why exactly am I okay with this?
- Because on my way home on Sunday,

16:10.625 --> 16:13.416
I'm gonna stop at D'Angelo's
and pick up sandwiches in time for tipoff,

16:13.583 --> 16:16.333
but if you make this miserable,
I'm gonna go anyway

16:16.333 --> 16:19.750
and then I'm gonna eat my sandwich
and yours while I listen to the game

16:19.750 --> 16:21.416
- on the radio.
- You know I hate watching

16:21.416 --> 16:22.958
- the Knicks alone.
- So do I!

16:22.958 --> 16:25.666
W-- Make sure they put the hot peppers
on my sandwich, please?

16:25.875 --> 16:28.375
- Not if you're gonna ask like that.
- I said, "Please."

16:33.375 --> 16:36.000
Please, could you have them

16:36.250 --> 16:38.750
- put the peppers on my sandwich?
- You got it.

16:42.166 --> 16:44.458
Take your shoes off
before you get in my car.

16:44.625 --> 16:45.666
You understand me?

16:47.791 --> 16:50.500
We have a lot to talk about,
but uh, that storm out there,

16:50.500 --> 16:52.708
it's getting angrier,
so let's get ahead of it.

16:52.708 --> 16:56.458
We'll talk at the beach, okay?
Pack your bag. Let's go.

17:23.333 --> 17:26.250
<i>Who are you?</i>

17:28.958 --> 17:33.583
<i>So weak. So scared.</i>

17:33.958 --> 17:36.250
<i>So sad.</i>

17:37.166 --> 17:42.958
<i>Run away, little hero,
before you get hurt.</i>

17:51.833 --> 17:52.833
We're here.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.041
On three?

17:57.791 --> 17:58.791
Ready?

17:59.416 --> 18:03.125
One, two... [laughs] ...three!

18:33.041 --> 18:35.791
I found the good marshmallows.
Ones that don't burn so easy.

18:37.583 --> 18:39.541
I don't think it was ever
the marshmallows' fault

18:39.541 --> 18:41.000
I wasn't paying attention.

18:53.958 --> 18:54.958
Mom...

18:56.416 --> 18:58.083
I need to talk to you about something.

19:06.083 --> 19:10.291
I'm used to feeling weird.
I'm used to the world feeling weird to me.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.958
Like a puzzle with half the wrong pieces.

19:16.166 --> 19:19.750
I try to pay attention. I really try, but...

19:21.125 --> 19:24.166
then I'm daydreaming. I can't help it.

19:27.250 --> 19:28.250
But lately...

19:29.291 --> 19:33.500
it hasn't felt like daydreaming.
It's felt...

19:34.750 --> 19:38.708
I don't know. More real, maybe?

19:41.875 --> 19:43.458
And then we were at the museum and...

19:45.041 --> 19:46.166
You saw something.

19:50.625 --> 19:55.500
Something that felt real to you,
but no one else could see?

20:08.458 --> 20:09.916
What did she say to you?

20:13.875 --> 20:17.583
She? How did you know it was a she?

20:22.083 --> 20:24.500
Do you know why we come
to this cabin every year?

20:24.708 --> 20:27.000
Because it's near the septic tanks,
so it's cheap.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.458
Mom, how did you know
about that thing I saw?

20:29.458 --> 20:31.541
We come to this place every year
because this is the place

20:31.541 --> 20:32.958
I met your father.

20:36.166 --> 20:39.458
My dad? What does my dad
have to do with this?

20:47.791 --> 20:50.833
A long time ago, I...

20:52.250 --> 20:55.291
met a man, here on the beach.

20:55.291 --> 21:01.375
He was wise and brave
and kind and... noble.

21:02.333 --> 21:05.750
From the moment I first saw him,
I knew that...

21:07.958 --> 21:11.958
that I had never met a man
like him before.

21:13.125 --> 21:19.958
And then I realized he was unlike
any man I had ever met before...

21:22.833 --> 21:28.583
because h... he wasn't a man at all.
He was a god.

21:35.375 --> 21:38.375
You fell in love with God? Like...

21:39.666 --> 21:41.041
Like-- like Jesus?

21:42.250 --> 21:47.250
Not God. A god. Percy...

21:49.125 --> 21:50.208
...the stories...

21:51.208 --> 21:56.333
that I have told you about Greek gods
and heroes and monsters, they are real.

21:56.458 --> 21:58.791
- Mom--
- In those stories, I have told you

21:58.916 --> 22:00.625
about how gods and mortals

22:00.750 --> 22:02.750
- would sometimes have children together...
- Mom, please, stop.

22:02.750 --> 22:03.958
- ...children called demigods...
- Mom!

22:03.958 --> 22:07.000
...and sometimes they are known
as half-bloods.

22:09.791 --> 22:13.166
That's what the monster called me.
Mom, what's happening?

22:13.166 --> 22:14.625
You are a half-blood.

22:16.708 --> 22:19.916
And half-bloods are not safe in the world.

22:21.416 --> 22:24.708
Once they reach a certain age
and they begin...

22:26.125 --> 22:31.375
to understand what they are,
terrible forces are drawn to them,

22:31.500 --> 22:35.291
driven to harm them before they can become
strong enough to fight back.

22:35.708 --> 22:39.541
That is what you have been feeling.

22:39.875 --> 22:43.625
It has always been a part of who you are,
it was always coming, I just--

22:43.750 --> 22:44.916
Why are you telling me this?

22:44.916 --> 22:47.708
Percy, I know that this
is hard to understand,

22:47.708 --> 22:49.666
but you have to believe me
that this is real.

22:49.666 --> 22:55.875
No, this is crazy. Okay? I am not a god.
There is something wrong with my brain.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.291
I understand that I'm weird,
believe me, I get it,

22:59.708 --> 23:02.083
but I'm afraid something
may be really broken now.

23:02.083 --> 23:04.875
- Oh, baby, no--
- And-- and now you're telling me stories,

23:05.000 --> 23:06.750
like it's gonna make it okay?

23:06.958 --> 23:10.166
Well, I'm not a baby!
I know there's no such thing as monsters,

23:10.166 --> 23:13.583
I know there's no such thing as gods,
and I know for certain

23:13.833 --> 23:16.500
that there is no such things as demigods.

23:16.625 --> 23:18.500
Who's there?

23:19.333 --> 23:21.416
- Mrs. Jackson? It's Grover.
- Grover?

23:21.416 --> 23:24.291
This is a little time sensitive.
Could someone maybe open the door?

23:24.291 --> 23:27.708
What is he doing here?
I don't wanna see him. Wait, Mom--

23:28.458 --> 23:30.791
I asked to have the night, you said
we could all leave in the morning.

23:30.916 --> 23:32.875
Sorry, I'm early,
but I didn't have any choice.

23:33.333 --> 23:35.416
Things have changed,
this is all developing a lot faster

23:35.541 --> 23:37.291
- than we anticipated.
- Early?

23:38.291 --> 23:40.916
You should have asked me before you--
Whatever it is you're gonna say,

23:40.916 --> 23:43.041
I don't wanna... hear it. Grover?

23:43.291 --> 23:44.291
Percy.

23:44.541 --> 23:46.500
- Okay, so something's coming...
- Grover.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.166
- ...and I know that sounds really bad...
- Grover?

23:48.166 --> 23:49.625
...but the important thing
is not to panic.

23:49.791 --> 23:50.833
I'm not panicking.

23:50.958 --> 23:53.583
- Grover!
- Great! I'm also definitely not panicking.

23:53.583 --> 23:55.333
I feel very good about
how we're doing so far--

23:55.333 --> 23:56.666
- Grover!
- What?

23:56.958 --> 23:59.250
Grover, why is there half a goat
in your pants?

23:59.375 --> 24:00.375
Oh, it's...

24:02.166 --> 24:05.166
Oh! Oh, boy, she didn't tell you about...

24:06.458 --> 24:09.000
- You didn't tell him about me?
- You're early.

24:13.083 --> 24:14.750
So the important thing is not to panic.

24:15.208 --> 24:17.333
We'll continue this in the car.
Let's go.

24:24.375 --> 24:27.000
My job has been to guide you
to this moment.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.875
It's always an emotional rollercoaster
for a young demigod,

24:30.000 --> 24:32.500
- so providing a support system is really--
- Who are you?

24:33.791 --> 24:37.416
- I'm Grover. I'm your best friend and--
- What are you?

24:40.875 --> 24:45.875
- I'm a satyr. And I'm your Protector.
- You're my Protector?

24:46.333 --> 24:47.958
If I hadn't gotten you
kicked out of school,

24:47.958 --> 24:49.541
you'd have never survived the night.

24:49.750 --> 24:52.125
And what's chasing us now
would have found you there easily.

24:56.125 --> 24:57.125
I'm sorry.

24:58.958 --> 25:02.000
Usually, I can sense danger coming
a mile away, but this time...

25:02.666 --> 25:04.291
Well, none of us saw Dodds coming.

25:06.125 --> 25:07.125
So you knew.

25:07.958 --> 25:10.791
That thing that Dodds turned into,
you saw it happen?

25:11.416 --> 25:13.583
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I saw some of it.

25:14.458 --> 25:17.500
The Mist kept her hidden even from us
until it was too late.

25:17.666 --> 25:19.416
Mist? What's a mist?

25:20.250 --> 25:24.541
The Mist. It's the veil that hides
the magical world from the human world.

25:24.750 --> 25:28.875
My legs. Dodds' wings.
Even Dodds' absence,

25:29.166 --> 25:32.500
but it isn't supposed to hide things
from me. That never happens.

25:32.791 --> 25:34.291
Something powerful is at work here.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.666
The sooner we get you to camp,
the better off you're...

25:38.041 --> 25:41.416
- You told him about camp, right?
- Not yet, no.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.875
Camp is a sanctuary
for half-bloods.

25:44.875 --> 25:46.375
A safe space where you can learn

25:46.375 --> 25:49.208
who you are and what the world is like
on the other side of the Mist.

25:49.500 --> 25:52.000
Uh, it's not far, actually,
just a little ways past the bend up there.

25:53.125 --> 25:55.041
Mom, what else haven't we talked about?

25:57.333 --> 25:58.708
What else haven't you told me?

26:03.708 --> 26:04.750
Is that the Minotaur?

26:05.125 --> 26:08.875
Once the attacks start, they never let up.
Okay? Dodds was just the beginning.

26:09.166 --> 26:11.833
He is next. He-- he is brutal.
He is relentless.

26:11.833 --> 26:13.583
He is still wearing underpants.

26:18.250 --> 26:20.250
The Mythomagic cards were training.

26:20.375 --> 26:22.541
Everything has been training
for what's still ahead of you.

26:22.541 --> 26:23.875
What's ahead of me?

26:23.875 --> 26:25.166
- Boys.
- Yeah?

26:25.291 --> 26:27.458
- I'm actually 24.
- Hold on, please.

27:46.208 --> 27:47.500
Is everyone okay?

27:47.708 --> 27:50.958
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Okay.

27:56.041 --> 27:57.041
This way!

28:09.041 --> 28:14.041
We're here. That's the boundary.
No monsters can cross it.

28:15.625 --> 28:17.458
Percy will be safe on the other side.

28:18.541 --> 28:21.375
"Percy will be..."
But won't all of us be safe?

28:26.208 --> 28:32.041
Grover, I am entrusting you
to protect my son, my only child.

28:32.041 --> 28:35.500
Don't worry, Mrs. Jackson,
Percy will be totally safe at camp--

28:35.500 --> 28:36.583
Swear it.

28:37.666 --> 28:40.250
- What's happening?
- Swear it, Grover!

28:40.708 --> 28:43.208
Keep him safe from anyone
or anything that comes for him,

28:43.208 --> 28:46.666
that wants to do harm,
that looks at him the wrong way.

28:46.666 --> 28:49.208
- Do you understand me?
- I swear!

29:00.583 --> 29:04.000
- I gotta go now, sweetheart.
- Go? What do you mean go?

29:04.000 --> 29:05.500
I can't go with you.

29:06.583 --> 29:09.208
- Why can't you?
- She's human.

29:15.916 --> 29:17.458
You're gonna need to be brave now.

29:18.625 --> 29:22.083
Remember what I taught you.
Remember the stories I told you.

29:22.083 --> 29:23.833
- Especially the stories, they will tell...
- No.

29:23.833 --> 29:25.875
- ...you everything...
- No way! Mom, I'm not leaving you!

29:25.875 --> 29:27.958
Perseus! Listen to me.

29:29.666 --> 29:30.666
You...

29:31.875 --> 29:33.875
are not broken.

29:36.083 --> 29:37.500
You are singular.

29:39.333 --> 29:40.625
You're a miracle.

29:43.041 --> 29:44.500
And you are my son.

29:48.833 --> 29:50.333
Hold fast.

29:52.583 --> 29:54.000
Brave the storm.

29:56.958 --> 29:58.041
I love you.

30:04.208 --> 30:05.958
We need to move.

30:05.958 --> 30:08.750
- Give me your coat.
- Why? What are you gonna do?

30:08.875 --> 30:10.958
He smells half-blood,
that's what he's tracking, yeah?

30:11.375 --> 30:13.125
- That's right.
- So if he smells you

30:13.250 --> 30:14.958
in two directions at once,
maybe I can confuse him,

30:15.083 --> 30:16.625
buy us both a little time to get away.

30:16.750 --> 30:18.458
- Mom, please, don't--
- Hey!

30:19.708 --> 30:20.875
It'll be okay.

30:41.458 --> 30:43.583
Go! Now!

31:01.000 --> 31:03.041
Hey! Look!

31:06.041 --> 31:08.041
Come on. Come on.

31:15.666 --> 31:18.666
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no--

31:21.250 --> 31:22.458
Mom!

31:24.166 --> 31:27.291
Mom!

31:52.375 --> 31:56.750
Per-- Percy! Percy, no!

33:15.000 --> 33:17.041
Is he okay?

33:17.250 --> 33:18.958
- Alone?
- How is that possible?

33:18.958 --> 33:20.541
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he's okay.

33:20.666 --> 33:21.916
He must be the one.

33:22.708 --> 33:24.083
Hush, Annabeth.

33:25.208 --> 33:28.958
He's waking. Everyone,
give him some space, please.

33:31.083 --> 33:33.958
Welcome to camp, Percy Jackson.

33:35.625 --> 33:37.250
We've been expecting you.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.125
Let the games begin!

35:34.875 --> 35:37.375
<i>It was so important I get here
'cause my father's a god.</i>

35:38.333 --> 35:39.625
<i>So, I'm gonna go find him.</i>
