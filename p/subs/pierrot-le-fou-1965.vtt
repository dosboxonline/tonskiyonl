00:01.042 --> 00:05.500
This film was restored by StudioCanal
and the Cinémathéque Francaise

00:05.583 --> 00:09.708
with the support of
the Franco-American Cultural Fund.

00:09.792 --> 00:13.000
Pierrot le fou was shot in Techniscope,
on Eastmancolor emulsion.

00:13.083 --> 00:17.417
Techniscope was often used at the time, notably for reasons of economy,
because the image only took up two perforations per photogramme.

00:17.500 --> 00:22.000
The dupe-positive, also printed Techniscope, is lost. As for the
internegative, it had become unusable and was destroyed in 1990.

00:22.083 --> 00:26.000
A new internegative element was made on reversible film stock, with an
anamorphic image on four frames, which is still used to make prints today.

00:26.083 --> 00:30.458
However, this element doesn't reflect the qualities of the
original work, particularly in terms of the colormetrics.

00:30.542 --> 00:34.542
The restoration resides entirely in the making of a new
negative from the digitisation in 2K of the camera negative,

00:34.625 --> 00:37.000
which has the original colors of Eastmancolor.

00:37.083 --> 00:41.667
As for the sound, the original magnetic elements disappeared,
a new negative was made from a positive of the period,

00:41.750 --> 00:44.458
respecting the original mono format.

01:39.500 --> 01:44.500
<i>"Past the age of 50, Velézquez
stopped painting definite things.</i>

01:44.667 --> 01:48.583
<i>He glided round objects
with the air, with the dusk.</i>

01:48.750 --> 01:53.583
<i>He elicited quivering colours from the
shadowy transparency of the background</i>

01:53.750 --> 01:58.375
<i>and made them the invisible centre
of his silent symphony.</i>

01:58.542 --> 02:02.542
<i>He gleaned from the world
only those mysterious exchanges</i>

02:02.708 --> 02:06.167
<i>which allow shapes and sounds to intermingle</i>

02:06.333 --> 02:08.625
<i>in a secret and continuous progression</i>

02:08.792 --> 02:14.417
<i>that no collision, no involuntary
movement can halt or betray.</i>

02:14.625 --> 02:16.000
<i>Space reigns.</i>

02:17.208 --> 02:20.458
<i>It is like an airy Wave gliding over surfaces,</i>

02:20.625 --> 02:25.208
<i>absorbing their visible emanations
to define and model them.</i>

02:25.375 --> 02:30.625
<i>It carries them along like a scent, like an echo,</i>

02:30.792 --> 02:35.083
<i>and scatters them everywhere
like some imponderable dust.</i>

02:35.250 --> 02:38.667
The world he lived in was sad.

02:38.833 --> 02:42.500
The king was a degenerate,
his children were sickly,

02:42.667 --> 02:46.625
and he was surrounded by idiots,
dwarves and invalids.

02:46.792 --> 02:50.083
There were ugly clowns, dressed like princes,

02:50.250 --> 02:52.958
whose purpose was to make fun of themselves

02:53.125 --> 02:56.417
to amuse people living outside reality,

02:56.583 --> 03:01.125
who were constrained by etiquette,
who plotted and lied,

03:01.292 --> 03:05.167
who were bound
by the confessional and by remorse,

03:05.333 --> 03:09.458
with the Inquisition and silence at the door."

03:12.250 --> 03:14.250
Listen to this, little girl.

03:16.917 --> 03:19.000
"There is a sense of nostalgia,

03:19.167 --> 03:23.250
but he avoids what is ugly, sad or cruelly morbid

03:23.417 --> 03:26.542
about this oppressed childhood.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.958
Velézquez is the painter of the night,
of vast expanses and of silence,

03:35.125 --> 03:39.958
even when he paints by day,
even when he paints inside a room,

03:40.125 --> 03:44.750
even when the sounds of war,
or of the hunt, are all around him.

03:44.917 --> 03:50.333
As they didn't go out during the day,
when the sun obliterates everything,

03:50.500 --> 03:54.750
Spanish painters communed with twilight."

03:54.917 --> 03:59.375
- Isn't that beautiful?
- You're mad to read such things to them.

03:59.542 --> 04:02.583
Go on, go to bed.

04:02.750 --> 04:07.458
- Why hasn't Odile put them to bed yet?
- Because you allowed her

04:07.625 --> 04:11.708
to go to the cinema for the third time this week.

04:11.875 --> 04:14.375
To go to the cinema for the third time.

04:14.542 --> 04:18.875
They're showingJohnny Guitar.
It's an education for her.

04:19.042 --> 04:22.542
- This world is too full of fools.
- Come on, hurry.

04:22.708 --> 04:26.917
- Frank and Paola will be here soon.
- I'm not going.

04:27.083 --> 04:29.917
- I'll stay with the children.
- Don't do that.

04:30.083 --> 04:35.167
Frank is bringing his niece.
She'll look after them until we get back.

04:35.333 --> 04:38.167
She's a student. She always does this.

04:38.333 --> 04:42.042
Since when does he have a niece?
She must be a call girl.

04:42.208 --> 04:47.083
- I'm not going.
- You'll do as you're told.

04:47.250 --> 04:51.792
The head of Standard Oil will be there,
and Daddy will introduce you.

04:51.958 --> 04:55.000
I should sue the TV station for firing me.

04:55.167 --> 04:58.500
Oh, no, you won't. You'd lose the court case.

04:58.667 --> 05:02.917
And when they offer you a job, please accept it.

05:03.083 --> 05:05.667
Come, that's enough.

05:10.125 --> 05:17.000
- Aren't you wearing a slip?
- I'm wearing an invisible girdle.

05:17.167 --> 05:22.583
"Under my new trousers, Scandal,
for a youthful figure."

05:22.750 --> 05:27.083
<i>We've had Athenian civilisation,
we've had the Renaissance,</i>

05:27.250 --> 05:30.667
<i>and now our civilisation centres round the arse.</i>

05:30.833 --> 05:34.417
- Follow me, I'll show you round.
- She loves children.

05:34.583 --> 05:38.000
If there's a problem, you can call us on...

05:38.167 --> 05:40.375
225-7001.

05:40.542 --> 05:43.667
- This is Frank's niece.
- Yes?

05:45.042 --> 05:47.125
Good evening.

05:49.708 --> 05:51.083
Hi.

05:51.250 --> 05:56.292
225. Haven't you read Balzac?
How about César Birotteau

05:56.500 --> 05:59.500
and the 5th Symphony resounding in his head?

05:59.667 --> 06:02.833
- What's up with you?
- Come on, let's go.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.708
<i>Chapter two: a surprise party
given by Mr and Mrs Expresso,</i>

06:06.875 --> 06:08.500
<i>whose daughter is my wife.</i>

06:08.667 --> 06:14.167
An Alfa Romeo has great acceleration,
powerful disc brakes,

06:14.333 --> 06:20.000
holds the road perfectly
and is an exceptional touring car.

06:20.167 --> 06:25.458
It is safe, fast, pleasant to drive,
responsive and stable.

06:27.250 --> 06:32.833
It's easy to look fresh. Soap cleanses,
cologne refreshes and scent perfumes.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.333
And to avoid perspiration, I use Printil,
and feel fresh for the rest of the day.

06:39.500 --> 06:45.417
Printil is available as a stick
deodorant, a roll-on or a spray.

06:45.583 --> 06:48.833
But the Oldsmobile Rocket 88 is even better.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.042
Look at its rigorous design.

06:52.208 --> 06:54.417
Its powerful, sober lines

06:54.583 --> 07:00.292
show that elegance and
exceptional performance can be combined.

07:02.833 --> 07:05.333
You look lonely.

07:09.958 --> 07:13.792
He's American. He doesn't speak French.

07:13.958 --> 07:18.583
What's his name? What does he do?

07:26.417 --> 07:30.875
He's Samuel Fuller.
He's an American film director.

07:31.042 --> 07:35.708
- He's makingLes <i>Fleurs du</i> Mal.
- Baudelaire, that's good.

07:38.875 --> 07:43.250
I've always wanted to know
what cinema is, exactly.

07:52.333 --> 07:54.833
Films are like battlegrounds.

07:57.125 --> 07:59.208
Love.

07:59.292 --> 08:02.125
Hate.

08:02.208 --> 08:04.250
Action.

08:04.333 --> 08:06.292
Violence.

08:06.375 --> 08:09.333
And death.

08:09.500 --> 08:12.375
In one word, emotions.

08:21.042 --> 08:27.833
My hairdo has stayed in place
all day thanks to Elnett Satin.

08:28.000 --> 08:35.167
And I can brush the hairspray off
just as easily as I sprayed it on.

08:38.250 --> 08:42.208
My hair is like golden silk.

08:43.542 --> 08:47.625
It's shiny and clean.

08:47.792 --> 08:53.625
Women should renounce flimsy negligees
and romantic nightgowns.

08:55.250 --> 09:01.167
In daylight, lingerie loses its charm
and can look indecent.

09:06.917 --> 09:09.542
<i>Tristesse d'Olympio.</i>

09:13.875 --> 09:17.625
- Give me the keys to the car.
- Aren't you staying?

09:17.792 --> 09:19.875
No, I'm tired.

09:21.292 --> 09:24.833
I have a seeing system, called "eyes".

09:25.000 --> 09:30.208
I use my ears to hear and my mouth to speak.

09:30.375 --> 09:35.875
I feel as if these systems
were separate. There's no unity.

09:36.042 --> 09:39.292
We should all feel unique,

09:39.458 --> 09:42.583
but I feel as if I were many people.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.583
You speak too much.

09:45.750 --> 09:50.375
- Having to listen to you is tiresome.
- I do speak too much.

09:50.542 --> 09:53.667
Lonely men always speak too much.

09:56.292 --> 09:59.125
I'll wait for you at home.

10:02.958 --> 10:07.958
<i>Next chapter: despair, memory, freedom,</i>

10:08.125 --> 10:13.125
<i>bitterness, hope, a search for times past.</i>

10:13.292 --> 10:15.125
<i>Marianne Renoir.</i>

10:24.208 --> 10:26.292
You're still here?

10:36.250 --> 10:38.417
Sorry.

10:38.583 --> 10:40.833
The tube is shut. How will you get back?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.083
I don't know.

10:44.583 --> 10:50.042
- Are you alone?
- Yes, I got bored, so I came back.

10:50.208 --> 10:53.875
Are you all right? You seem down.

10:54.042 --> 10:58.708
There are days when
you only seem to come across morons.

10:58.875 --> 11:03.875
It leads you to look in the mirror
and question yourself.

11:05.500 --> 11:08.083
I'll drive you home.

11:20.042 --> 11:22.417
- He lent you his car?
- Yes.

11:22.583 --> 11:25.792
- Why? Don't you like Americans?
- No, I do.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.292
- It feels strange to see you again.
- Yes, it's been four years.

11:34.458 --> 11:38.958
It's been five-and-a-half years. It was October.

11:39.125 --> 11:41.083
You've married.

11:41.250 --> 11:44.667
I met a rich Italian,
but I'm not that interested in her.

11:44.833 --> 11:49.333
- Why don't you divorce her?
- I felt like it, but I'm too lazy.

11:49.500 --> 11:56.417
You have to feel alive to want anything,
have you noticed that?

11:56.583 --> 12:02.833
- Do you still teach Spanish?
- No, I worked in TV, but I resigned.

12:04.667 --> 12:07.958
- How about you?
- Nothing special.

12:08.125 --> 12:10.917
- You don't want to talk about yourself?
- No.

12:11.083 --> 12:13.917
A friend of mine saw you in London two years ago.

12:14.083 --> 12:18.333
- Are you still seeing that American?
- That was over a long time ago.

12:18.500 --> 12:22.042
How long have you known Frank?

12:22.208 --> 12:28.083
- I... just met him by chance.
- You're as mysterious as ever.

12:28.250 --> 12:31.833
It's just that I don't like to talk about myself.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.125
All right, then I'll keep quiet.

12:42.542 --> 12:49.375
<i>His garrison had already been decimated
by the Vietcong, who also lost 115 men.</i>

12:49.542 --> 12:51.917
It's awful, so impersonal.

12:52.083 --> 12:55.667
- What is?
- They speak of 115 resistance fighters,

12:55.833 --> 12:57.875
and it means nothing.

12:58.042 --> 13:02.792
And yet, each one of them is a man,
and we know nothing about them

13:02.958 --> 13:08.500
if they love a woman, have children,
prefer the cinema to the theatre.

13:08.667 --> 13:13.792
We know nothing about them.
All we can say is: 115 dead.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.500
It's the same with photographs.
It's always fascinated me.

13:18.667 --> 13:23.167
You see the man, frozen in time,
with a caption underneath.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.875
He was either a coward or a hero.

13:26.042 --> 13:30.958
But at the time the picture was taken,
no one can say who he really was,

13:31.125 --> 13:35.917
or who he was thinking about.
His wife? His mistress?

13:36.083 --> 13:41.750
The past? The future? About basketball?
We'll never know.

13:42.833 --> 13:45.000
That's life.

13:45.167 --> 13:50.167
What upsets me is that life
is so different from novels.

13:50.333 --> 13:53.292
I wish they were the same.

13:53.458 --> 13:57.375
Clear, logical, organised.

13:58.500 --> 14:01.042
But they aren't.

14:01.208 --> 14:04.667
They're more similar than people think.

14:04.833 --> 14:07.417
No, they're not, Pierrot.

14:07.583 --> 14:10.375
Must I remind you to call me Ferdinand?

14:10.542 --> 14:14.708
But one can't say: "My friend, Ferdinand."

14:14.875 --> 14:18.542
Yes, you can. Just try it, Marianne.

14:20.083 --> 14:22.500
I'll try.

14:22.667 --> 14:25.583
I'll do anything you want.

14:26.917 --> 14:29.833
So will I, Marianne.

14:31.792 --> 14:35.458
I'm putting my hand on your knee.

14:35.625 --> 14:38.167
Me too, Marianne.

14:40.750 --> 14:43.875
I'm kissing you everywhere.

14:45.125 --> 14:47.208
Me too, Marianne.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.250
We'll see.

15:01.417 --> 15:04.208
<i>Marianne Renoir.</i>

15:19.417 --> 15:22.125
Come on, wake up!

16:00.833 --> 16:02.792
- I was right.
- About what?

16:02.958 --> 16:06.917
You didn't believe me when I said
we'd always love each other.

16:07.083 --> 16:10.292
I've never said I'd love you forever.

16:10.458 --> 16:12.875
Oh, my love

16:13.042 --> 16:17.542
You never promised to adore me at all

16:19.500 --> 16:22.750
We've never exchanged such vows

16:22.917 --> 16:26.333
Though we know each other so well

16:27.875 --> 16:31.583
We'd never have believed
we'd forever be slaves to love

16:31.708 --> 16:34.833
As we're both so fickle

16:35.042 --> 16:43.250
And yet, without having to say a word,
little by little

16:45.167 --> 16:50.708
Feelings slipped between our bodies,
which so loved to merge

16:52.667 --> 16:58.708
And then words of love fell
from our naked lips, little by little

17:00.333 --> 17:07.292
Many words of love mingled with our kisses

17:11.583 --> 17:15.292
I never would have believed
I would always love you

17:15.458 --> 17:18.000
My love

17:18.167 --> 17:23.375
We never thought we could live together
without tiring of each other

17:24.667 --> 17:31.833
Or that we'd wake up every morning
so happy to be in the same bed

17:33.333 --> 17:40.458
Or wish for no more than the simple
joy of being so comfortable together

17:55.792 --> 18:03.500
And yet, without either of us
saying much, little by little

18:06.000 --> 18:11.792
Our feelings have bound us together forever

18:14.000 --> 18:20.750
Feelings which were stronger
than any known or unknown words of love

18:20.917 --> 18:27.167
Feelings which were more passionate
than either of us could have anticipated

18:27.333 --> 18:32.333
Don't ever promise to adore me forever

18:33.583 --> 18:39.458
Let us not exchange such promises,
given the way we both are

18:40.958 --> 18:45.833
Let us pretend that our love

18:46.042 --> 18:50.583
is a love without a future

18:50.750 --> 18:55.583
We'll know by the time we're dead
if we carried on loving each other.

18:55.750 --> 19:00.250
I know that I love you.
It's you I'm not so sure about.

19:00.417 --> 19:04.083
- I'm not sure.
- I do love you, Marianne. I do.

19:04.250 --> 19:06.833
Well, we'll see.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.167
- <i>Your wife</i> came <i>round this morning.</i>
- <i>Who cares?</i>

19:13.333 --> 19:17.667
<i>- That's not all.
- I just told you I don't care.</i>

19:17.833 --> 19:20.458
<i>Marianne told Ferdinand a complicated story.</i>

19:20.625 --> 19:23.833
<i>- I met some people...
- It was like the Algerian war.</i>

19:24.000 --> 19:28.708
<i>- I'll explain everything.
- It was like waking from a bad dream.</i>

20:18.125 --> 20:20.375
<i>- Frank had your keys?
- I'll explain.</i>

20:20.542 --> 20:23.667
<i>Were you in love with him? Did he ever kiss you?</i>

20:23.833 --> 20:26.417
<i>I'll explain everything.</i>

21:18.958 --> 21:23.750
<i>- It was a complicated story.
- To wake from a bad dream.</i>

21:23.917 --> 21:26.500
<i>- Politics.
- An organisation.</i>

21:26.667 --> 21:29.417
<i>Arms traffic.</i>

21:29.583 --> 21:32.167
<i>Silently, silently.</i>

21:34.375 --> 21:35.875
<i>Silently.</i>

21:49.000 --> 21:51.333
<i>- It's me, Marianne.
- Did he kiss you?</i>

21:51.500 --> 21:55.083
<i>- A complicated story.
- Were you in love with him?</i>

21:55.250 --> 21:58.292
<i>- Used my apartment.
- It was like the Algerian war.</i>

21:58.458 --> 22:01.208
<i>- I have a brother.
- To wake from a bad dream.</i>

22:01.375 --> 22:04.500
<i>We had to leave quickly.</i>

22:04.667 --> 22:06.833
<i>- To knock out. Garage.
- Who is he?</i>

22:07.000 --> 22:10.542
<i>To go south. No money.</i>

22:10.708 --> 22:14.000
<i>It was high time we left this rotten world.</i>

22:14.167 --> 22:18.542
<i>- We left Paris by a unique route.
- Recognising two of her own,</i>

22:18.708 --> 22:22.208
<i>the Statue of Liberty greeted us warmly.</i>

22:24.625 --> 22:26.167
Sir!

22:28.583 --> 22:31.542
- Put a tiger in my engine.
- We don't sell tigers here.

22:31.708 --> 22:34.833
Then fill her up and keep quiet.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.125
He'll be less suspicious if it's me.

23:05.458 --> 23:07.958
That'll be 4,900.

23:08.125 --> 23:11.250
Check the water and the oil, my man.

23:19.833 --> 23:22.417
Help me, you fool.

23:29.375 --> 23:34.375
- Shit, there's another one.
- Get in the car.

23:35.333 --> 23:38.708
- Don't you have any money?
- No, sir, we don't.

23:38.875 --> 23:41.500
Don't you want to work to earn money?

23:41.667 --> 23:46.958
- No, sir, we don't.
- So how will you pay for the petrol?

23:48.750 --> 23:51.875
Shit, there's another one. Stay there.

24:09.917 --> 24:12.125
I'll call the police!

24:14.875 --> 24:17.000
<i>- Total.
- It was an adventure film.</i>

24:17.167 --> 24:19.250
<i>- A diadem of blood.
- Total.</i>

24:19.417 --> 24:21.958
- Tender is the Night.
- <i>A</i> romantic novel.

24:22.125 --> 24:26.625
- <i>A</i> romantic novel.
- Tender is the Night.

24:27.958 --> 24:31.083
We'll find my brother eventually.

24:38.583 --> 24:44.500
- What does he deal in, exactly?
- Stuff in Africa.

24:44.667 --> 24:47.375
In Angola, in the Congo.

24:47.542 --> 24:50.125
I thought he worked for Télé Monte Carlo.

24:50.292 --> 24:51.833
Yes, that too.

24:56.375 --> 24:59.292
So, where are we going?

25:00.750 --> 25:05.375
We said we'd go to Nice.
And then, maybe, on to Italy.

25:05.542 --> 25:10.750
12,000 francs won't last us to Nice.
We'd better abandon this car.

25:13.708 --> 25:17.750
- Have you ever killed a man, Pierrot?
- My name is Ferdinand.

25:17.958 --> 25:20.542
Why do you ask?

25:22.042 --> 25:25.667
Because you won't like it.

25:26.958 --> 25:30.750
I wonder what she told the police.

25:30.917 --> 25:34.833
- Maybe they've not questioned her yet.
- Don't you believe it.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.208
She must have really slammed you.

25:38.375 --> 25:42.167
She's quite right. I'm sorry for her.

25:42.333 --> 25:47.042
Sorry? Men like you are always sorry.

25:48.500 --> 25:51.083
And always too late.

26:10.375 --> 26:13.292
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking at myself.

26:13.458 --> 26:15.042
And what do you see?

26:15.250 --> 26:20.458
The face of a man who's going to
throw himself off a cliff at high speed.

26:21.833 --> 26:28.375
I see a woman who is in love with the
man who'll throw himself off a cliff.

26:28.542 --> 26:31.125
So let's kiss.

26:39.958 --> 26:45.458
<i>- The following day.
- We got back into the car.</i>

26:45.625 --> 26:50.167
<i>- And arrived in a little town.
- We're almost out of petrol.</i>

26:50.333 --> 26:52.625
<i>Marianne and Ferdinand stop at a bar.</i>

26:52.792 --> 26:56.208
<i>They order something
and wonder how they'll pay for it.</i>

26:56.375 --> 27:00.875
<i>- The police are after them.
- They're getting odd looks from people.</i>

27:01.083 --> 27:03.667
<i>- The police...
- People...</i>

27:03.833 --> 27:06.792
<i>- They're getting odd looks from people.
- There's...</i>

27:06.958 --> 27:09.458
Laszlo Kovacs, student.

27:09.625 --> 27:16.125
Born on the 25th January 1936, in Santo Domingo.

27:16.292 --> 27:19.167
I left after the American landing.

27:19.333 --> 27:23.583
I came to France as a political refugee.

27:23.750 --> 27:28.208
France is the country of freedom,
equality and brotherhood.

27:28.375 --> 27:32.708
Viviane Blassel, born on
the 21st March 1943 in Marseille.

27:32.875 --> 27:36.958
I'm 22. I work at the cosmetics counter
in a department store in Auxerre.

27:37.125 --> 27:43.125
Eté André, born on the 25th May 1903
in Marbouie, Eure-et-Loir.

27:43.292 --> 27:48.167
62 years old. Currently acting as a film extra.

27:48.333 --> 27:51.083
<i>Let's tell stories,
maybe they'll take pity on us.</i>

27:51.250 --> 27:54.667
<i>- What shall we tell them?
- About the fall of Constantinople,</i>

27:54.833 --> 27:58.250
<i>about Nicolas de Staels suicide.</i>

27:58.417 --> 28:01.833
<i>About William Wilson,
who saw his double in the street</i>

28:02.000 --> 28:03.875
<i>and went after him to kill him.</i>

28:04.042 --> 28:07.625
<i>And once he had, he realised he'd killed himself</i>

28:07.792 --> 28:09.833
<i>and his double was still alive.</i>

28:10.000 --> 28:12.583
<i>OK, they might even give us some money.</i>

28:12.750 --> 28:15.667
<i>Marianne, who had the eyes
of Aucassin and Nicolette,</i>

28:15.833 --> 28:19.250
<i>told them about William of Orange's
nephew, Vivien,</i>

28:19.417 --> 28:23.417
<i>who died fighting 30,000 Saracens.</i>

28:23.583 --> 28:28.500
<i>He bled from 1,000 wounds and he fought
alone, for he'd sworn not to retreat.</i>

28:28.667 --> 28:33.333
<i>Oh, young and gentle nephew,
why such a mad and noble oath?</i>

28:33.500 --> 28:37.042
<i>Ferdinand told them the story of Guynemer,</i>

28:37.208 --> 28:41.542
<i>but they didn't listen to him,
so he spoke of the summer,</i>

28:41.708 --> 28:46.000
<i>and of how lovers crave the warm night air.</i>

28:46.167 --> 28:50.875
<i>He spoke of man, and the seasons,
and unexpected encounters.</i>

28:51.042 --> 28:54.417
<i>But he told them never to ask which came first,</i>

28:54.583 --> 28:58.583
<i>words or things,
nor to ask what will happen next.</i>

28:58.792 --> 29:01.833
<i>I feel alive, that's all that matters.</i>

29:26.000 --> 29:28.583
I have an idea.

29:30.042 --> 29:33.167
We'll pretend we've had an accident.

29:44.417 --> 29:48.583
That way, the police will think
we're dead. OK, Pierrot?

29:48.792 --> 29:51.625
My name is Ferdinand.

29:51.792 --> 29:56.250
All we have to do is burn the car.
They'll think we've burned too.

29:56.417 --> 29:59.958
- Always fire, blood and war!
- It wasn't my idea!

30:00.125 --> 30:04.750
Bring the car closer.
It has to look real. This isn't a film.

30:06.917 --> 30:09.708
Come closer. Hurry up!

30:15.792 --> 30:21.292
- I don't have any matches. Let's go.
- It doesn't matter. Give me the rifle.

30:23.125 --> 30:27.708
- It's the make that killed Kennedy.
- Didn't you know I killed him?

30:27.875 --> 30:30.583
- Get out of the way.
- Wait a minute.

30:30.750 --> 30:33.375
- It's burning well.
- Yep.

30:33.583 --> 30:38.875
Do you know what was in the suitcase?
Dollars. The ones in the flat.

30:39.042 --> 30:43.625
- I bet you didn't warn me on purpose.
- That's right.

30:43.792 --> 30:46.792
Think what we could have done with that money.

30:46.917 --> 30:51.500
We could have gone to Chicago,
Las Vegas, Monte Carlo. You idiot!

30:51.667 --> 30:57.875
I'd have gone to Florence or Athens.
Let's go, travel broadens the mind.

31:52.833 --> 31:55.542
<i>- Chapter eight.
- A season in hell.</i>

31:55.667 --> 31:58.458
<i>- Chapter eight.
- We crossed France.</i>

31:58.625 --> 32:01.333
<i>- Like shadows.
- Like mirrors.</i>

34:07.042 --> 34:09.083
<i>- Like shadows.
- Like mirrors.</i>

34:09.250 --> 34:13.167
<i>I saw the cafe where Van Gogh
decided to cut off his ear.</i>

34:13.375 --> 34:17.750
<i>- You're a liar. What did you see?
- I saw...</i>

34:22.792 --> 34:26.458
- Look, Pierrot, a Ford Galaxy.
- My name is Ferdinand.

34:26.625 --> 34:29.708
Yes, that's the '62 model.

34:29.833 --> 34:32.750
- Show that you're a man.
- Let me finish.

34:32.917 --> 34:37.542
"After eating up a good many miles,
they came to the Bayuda desert,

34:37.708 --> 34:40.917
which they had to cross to reach Khartoum.

34:41.083 --> 34:46.833
'Not much shade!' they grumbled,
as they set out under a burning sun.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.792
'We'd be better off
in the shade of a glass of lager!"'

34:50.958 --> 34:54.167
Make up your mind or I'll hitchhike alone.

34:54.333 --> 34:56.583
All right, let's go.

35:18.167 --> 35:21.125
A grease-job.

35:21.292 --> 35:24.292
Where are the toilets?

35:24.458 --> 35:26.542
Come on, Mimi.

35:35.875 --> 35:39.042
Hey, kid! How'd you like to own a car like this?

35:39.208 --> 35:41.792
Well, you never will.

36:14.792 --> 36:17.375
Marianne, the jacket!

36:20.042 --> 36:24.167
Hey, kid! How'd you like to earn 10,000 francs?

37:07.958 --> 37:10.333
<i>The landscape rose slowly before us.</i>

37:10.500 --> 37:14.500
<i>Many centuries fled into the distance,
like storms.</i>

37:24.500 --> 37:27.625
Get rid of the clothes while I turn around.

37:35.542 --> 37:38.125
Hey! Not my comic book!

38:16.875 --> 38:19.917
- Well?
- Nothing much.

38:20.042 --> 38:25.750
They questioned her.
She said she saw us naked in my bed.

38:25.917 --> 38:28.375
You see? And you called me a liar.

38:28.542 --> 38:32.750
- Anything else?
- You're pretty interested in your wife.

38:32.917 --> 38:38.542
<i>Nothing happened.
I don't understand. He went mad.</i>

38:39.542 --> 38:43.250
As soon as you leave a woman,
she says you've gone mad.

38:43.417 --> 38:46.333
Men are exactly the same.

38:47.500 --> 38:49.083
That's true.

38:49.208 --> 38:53.458
Besides, I don't know why,
but I'm beginning to smell death.

38:53.625 --> 38:58.042
- Admit that you miss her!
- Stop, you're getting on my nerves.

38:58.208 --> 39:02.958
The smell of death in the landscape,
the trees, in women's faces, in cars...

39:03.125 --> 39:06.375
What are we going to do without money?

39:06.542 --> 39:10.167
- We can't even get to Italy.
- We can stop anywhere.

39:15.333 --> 39:19.625
- We can stop anywhere.
- What will we do all day?

39:19.792 --> 39:23.708
We must find my brother.
He'll give us lots of money.

39:23.875 --> 39:29.708
Then we'll find a smart hotel and have some fun.

39:29.833 --> 39:32.583
- She just wants to have fun.
- Who are you talking to?

39:32.750 --> 39:35.500
To the audience.

39:35.667 --> 39:39.125
I told you you were having regrets.

39:39.292 --> 39:42.500
- You were crazy to do this.
- No, I'm in love.

39:42.667 --> 39:45.667
It's the same thing.

39:45.833 --> 39:49.458
I've decided never to fall in love again.

39:49.625 --> 39:52.917
- I think it's disgusting.
- Don't say that.

40:00.958 --> 40:02.500
Don't say that.

40:02.667 --> 40:06.625
Ten minutes ago, I saw death everywhere.
And now look,

40:06.792 --> 40:10.375
the sea, the waves, the sky.

40:10.542 --> 40:13.875
Life may be sad, but it's still beautiful.

40:14.042 --> 40:17.708
I suddenly feel free. We can do
whatever we want when we want.

40:17.875 --> 40:22.458
- Right, left, right, left.
- Look at the little fool.

40:22.625 --> 40:26.875
He's driving down a straight line
and he has to follow it all the way.

40:27.042 --> 40:28.875
What? Look.

40:41.042 --> 40:43.458
<i>- Chapter eight.
- A season in hell.</i>

40:43.625 --> 40:47.833
<i>- Love needs to be reinvented.
- Real life is elsewhere.</i>

40:47.958 --> 40:52.500
<i>Many centuries fled into the distance,
like storms.</i>

40:52.667 --> 40:55.917
<i>I held her close and began to cry.</i>

40:56.083 --> 40:59.500
<i>It was the first, it was the only dream.</i>

41:17.542 --> 41:22.208
- Are you coming, then?
- Yes. Where are we going?

41:22.333 --> 41:25.125
To the mysterious island.

41:25.292 --> 41:28.208
- To do what?
- Nothing. Just exist.

41:28.375 --> 41:32.000
- That won't be any fun.
- That's life.

41:34.333 --> 41:36.917
No, not at all.

41:37.125 --> 41:41.958
It's a good thing I don't like spinach,
or I'd eat it,

41:42.125 --> 41:44.583
and I can't stand the stuff.

41:44.750 --> 41:49.417
It's the same with you, only the other way round.

41:50.917 --> 41:53.458
There was a film like that with Michel Simon.

41:53.583 --> 41:58.167
- He was taken by this girl...
- You did want to change your life.

41:58.333 --> 42:01.917
- I didn't mean to be nasty.
- You said we'd see this through.

42:02.125 --> 42:04.333
To the end of the night, yes.

42:22.208 --> 42:25.333
What a good view of the moon.

42:27.333 --> 42:32.625
- I see nothing special.
- I do. I can see a man.

42:32.792 --> 42:36.958
Maybe it's Leonov, or that American, White.

42:37.125 --> 42:39.167
Yes, I see him too.

42:39.333 --> 42:43.208
But it's neither a Rusky
nor a nephew of Uncle Sam.

42:43.375 --> 42:45.083
I'll tell you who it is.

42:45.250 --> 42:49.833
It's the moon's only inhabitant.
And do you know what he's doing?

42:50.000 --> 42:53.417
- Leaving as fast as he can.
- Why?

42:53.583 --> 42:54.958
Look.

42:55.167 --> 42:59.208
Because he's had enough.
He was glad to see Leonov turn up.

42:59.375 --> 43:04.167
Someone to talk to at last!
He'd been all alone for an eternity.

43:04.333 --> 43:08.292
But Leonov tried to brainwash him
with the complete works of Lenin.

43:08.458 --> 43:12.375
So when White landed,
he sought refuge in his camp.

43:12.542 --> 43:16.542
But he'd barely had time to say "hello",
when White emptied a Coke down him,

43:16.708 --> 43:18.583
and even expected thanks.

43:18.750 --> 43:23.792
So he's fed up. He'll leave them
to shoot it out and go.

43:23.958 --> 43:26.542
- Where will he go?
- He'll come here.

43:26.708 --> 43:31.000
Because he thinks you're beautiful.
He admires you.

43:38.458 --> 43:43.708
I find your legs and your breasts very moving.

43:48.042 --> 43:50.125
Be quiet.

44:06.667 --> 44:08.250
<i>Chapter seven.</i>

44:08.417 --> 44:11.958
<i>- A poet named revolver.

44:12.125 --> 44:14.458
<i>- Get away.

<i>- As long as one of us wants to run.

45:47.667 --> 45:52.667
MOUTH: ONOMATOPOEIA THAT BECOME LANGUAGE.

45:56.458 --> 45:59.875
THE WRITER CHOOSES TO APPEAL...
FREEDOM OF OTHERS...

46:04.917 --> 46:08.042
- Did you get my books?
- No, but I found this.

46:08.208 --> 46:10.667
- The author shares your name.
- Ferdinand.

46:10.833 --> 46:12.667
You've heard of him?

46:12.833 --> 46:17.583
"I am fire, I am light, I am a miracle.

46:17.750 --> 46:21.958
I can no longer hear. I rise.

46:22.125 --> 46:25.292
I fly through the air.

46:25.458 --> 46:28.333
It's too much.

46:28.500 --> 46:32.417
I've seen happiness before me.

46:32.583 --> 46:34.917
Supernatural emotion!

46:40.042 --> 46:44.792
And now... I know nothing.

46:47.125 --> 46:50.625
I reach out my hand,

46:52.958 --> 46:55.958
and dare, moving right,

46:57.083 --> 47:00.083
to touch, to caress,

47:00.250 --> 47:04.583
the hair of my dear fairy, of my beloved marvel,

47:04.750 --> 47:06.625
Virginia.

47:06.792 --> 47:10.917
<i>Guignol's Band</i>.Are you coming?

47:11.083 --> 47:14.125
"Perfect happiness!

47:14.292 --> 47:20.917
My ecstasy was so intense that I dared not move.

47:21.083 --> 47:26.875
Happy till I could cry, filled
with happiness, I quiver, quiver.

47:33.500 --> 47:38.500
My heart is bursting, burning me,
and I, too, have become flame.

47:38.667 --> 47:42.333
I am part of space, I cling to Virginia."

47:42.500 --> 47:45.083
Let me take your book.

47:48.375 --> 47:53.750
"You promised me China, Tibet, Mr Sosthéne,

47:53.917 --> 47:57.708
the Sunda Islands and wonderful, magical plants."

47:57.875 --> 48:00.792
Where are all these places?

48:00.958 --> 48:06.333
"Cham-cham-cham... ratatam...
I knew that he was lying."

48:09.792 --> 48:11.958
- What day is it?
- Friday.

48:12.125 --> 48:15.292
- You'll never leave me?
- Of course not.

48:15.458 --> 48:19.292
- Of course?
- Yes.

48:19.458 --> 48:21.542
Of course.

48:29.125 --> 48:31.750
Yes, of course.

48:38.417 --> 48:41.667
THURSDAY: POETRY, THE LOSER WINS.

48:43.917 --> 48:48.833
What can I do? I don't know what to do.

49:00.625 --> 49:04.042
Quiet! I'm trying to write.

49:04.208 --> 49:09.917
"This is the issue.
You wait for me, and I'm not there.

49:10.042 --> 49:16.292
I come into the room and only then
do I begin to exist for you.

49:16.458 --> 49:21.833
And yet I existed before that,
I thought, maybe I even suffered.

49:22.000 --> 49:26.667
This is the issue:
to show you, alive, thinking of me,

49:26.833 --> 49:30.583
and to see myself alive, by that very fact."

49:30.750 --> 49:33.333
I'll underline this.

49:37.792 --> 49:41.250
Are you thinking of your brother
and the whole arms business?

49:41.417 --> 49:42.792
No.

49:46.167 --> 49:49.250
Then why do you look sad?

49:49.417 --> 49:55.250
Because you speak to me with words,
and I look at you with feelings.

49:55.417 --> 49:59.583
It's impossible to have a conversation with you.

49:59.750 --> 50:02.333
You never have any ideas, just feelings.

50:02.500 --> 50:05.833
That's not true. Feelings contain ideas.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.167
Let's try to have a serious conversation.

50:10.333 --> 50:15.417
You'll tell me what you like,
what you want, and I'll do the same.

50:15.583 --> 50:17.833
Go on, you start.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.417
Flowers, animals...

50:25.000 --> 50:28.708
Blue skies, the sound of music...

50:30.083 --> 50:33.708
I don't know. Everything. And you?

50:36.042 --> 50:38.958
Ambition...

50:39.125 --> 50:41.000
Hope...

50:41.167 --> 50:45.333
Movement, accidents.

50:47.458 --> 50:50.583
What else? I don't know. Everything.

50:56.083 --> 50:59.250
You see? I was right five years ago.

51:01.833 --> 51:04.958
We don't understand each other.

51:06.708 --> 51:11.167
What can I do? I don't know what to do.

51:24.875 --> 51:31.125
SUNDAY: SHE OPENED THE... THEN...

51:31.292 --> 51:35.458
MONDAY...

51:42.542 --> 51:45.833
- How's the old man?
- Not bad.

51:46.000 --> 51:49.750
I've found an idea for a novel.

51:49.917 --> 51:53.000
I won't describe people's lives,

51:53.167 --> 51:57.750
but life itself, just life.

51:59.125 --> 52:06.417
Everything that takes place between
people: space, sounds and colours.

52:07.667 --> 52:11.292
It should be possible.

52:11.500 --> 52:14.542
Joyce tried to do it,

52:14.708 --> 52:19.083
but I should be able to improve on him.

52:19.250 --> 52:22.417
Here are your books.

52:22.583 --> 52:25.292
These aren't the ones.

52:25.458 --> 52:31.458
- One of them is missing. I said five.
- I bought myself a record.

52:31.625 --> 52:36.375
I said a record for every 50 books.
Music comes after literature.

52:36.542 --> 52:39.125
If you don't like it...

52:44.875 --> 52:49.042
My little one, it's all as one.

52:50.125 --> 52:55.958
- What's wrong with you?
- I can make rhymes, too, stupid.

52:56.083 --> 52:59.542
- What's up, Marianne?
- I've had enough!

52:59.708 --> 53:05.042
I'm sick of the sea, the sun, the sand,
tins - everything!

53:05.208 --> 53:09.875
I'm sick of wearing the same dress!
I want to leave.

53:11.583 --> 53:13.542
I want to live a full life.

53:13.708 --> 53:19.958
- What do you want me to do?
- I don't know. I'll leave.

53:20.125 --> 53:22.958
I threw away the rest of our money.

53:23.125 --> 53:26.250
- Where?
- In the sea, you fool.

53:27.500 --> 53:29.042
Here.

53:32.292 --> 53:35.167
You're mad, Marianne.

53:35.333 --> 53:38.458
If we're to leave, we'll need money.

53:43.333 --> 53:48.042
There are loads of tourists. We can rob them.

53:48.167 --> 53:52.875
- Come on, Pierrot!
- My name is Ferdinand.

53:53.042 --> 53:56.500
Let's stop pretending to be
in a book by Jules Verne.

53:56.667 --> 54:03.667
Let's go back to our thriller -
full of cars, guns and nightclubs.

54:03.792 --> 54:06.083
Come on!

54:06.250 --> 54:09.167
Wait for me, Marianne!

54:11.375 --> 54:16.375
- Does your brother really exist?
- You never believe me.

54:26.500 --> 54:30.958
Say, if we find Fred and he gives us some money,

54:31.125 --> 54:34.250
can't we go to Miami?

54:36.708 --> 54:39.167
- Deep down, you're a coward.
- No.

54:39.333 --> 54:42.917
"Courage consists in staying home,
close to nature,

54:43.083 --> 54:45.292
who is oblivious to our disasters."

54:45.458 --> 54:48.167
Hurry, the tourist boat is about to leave.

54:48.333 --> 54:51.000
Wait, I have an idea.

54:51.167 --> 54:53.750
Give me your lipstick.

55:02.208 --> 55:09.292
"After all, the only interesting thing

55:09.417 --> 55:13.958
is the road that people follow.

55:14.125 --> 55:17.917
The tragic part is that once we know

55:18.083 --> 55:24.875
where they are going, who they are,
everything else is still a mystery."

55:25.042 --> 55:28.542
- Like the scent of eucalyptus.
- Eucalyptus, that's it.

55:28.708 --> 55:35.833
- Too right!
- "And life is an unresolved mystery."

55:36.000 --> 55:39.542
- Hurry up, Paul.
- Shut up, Virginie.

55:49.667 --> 55:52.667
WE ARE DEAD PEOPLE ON LEAVE. AND THE TREES?

56:17.333 --> 56:21.500
TO EARN MONEY, WE DREW FOR THE TOURISTS.

56:21.667 --> 56:24.625
MODERN SLAVES.

56:36.333 --> 56:38.750
Damn these Americans.

56:38.917 --> 56:43.167
It doesn't matter. We'll hit on a different plan.

56:43.375 --> 56:45.500
- All we need to do is...
- What?

56:45.667 --> 56:48.958
We can put on a play.
Maybe they'll give us some dollars.

56:49.125 --> 56:52.417
- What play?
- Something they'll like.

56:52.542 --> 56:55.167
I know. The Vietnam war.

57:51.167 --> 57:55.250
THE NEPHEW OF UNCLE SAM
VERSUS THE NIECE OF UNCLE HO.

58:31.917 --> 58:36.708
A bit of dosh for the actors.

58:36.875 --> 58:38.250
Don't worry, Pierrot.

58:52.333 --> 58:55.292
We've shaken them off. Let's go home.

58:55.458 --> 58:59.000
No, listen, I'm going dancing.

58:59.167 --> 59:01.792
No, come on. You can go tomorrow.

59:01.958 --> 59:05.125
<i>Following chapter. Despair.</i>

59:05.292 --> 59:07.792
- I'm staying here.
- I'll go back alone.

59:07.958 --> 59:10.042
- <i>Hope.</i>
- Yes, you do that.

59:10.208 --> 59:15.375
<i>- Remembrance of things past.
- They told me there was a nightclub.</i>

59:15.542 --> 59:19.958
I'm going dancing. Who cares if we get killed?

59:21.333 --> 59:27.750
Who cares if they find us?
I wanted to buy a record player.

59:27.958 --> 59:31.625
I couldn't, because he keeps buying books.

59:31.792 --> 59:37.417
I don't particularly mind,
but he doesn't even understand that.

59:38.792 --> 59:42.125
I don't care about books, about records.

59:42.292 --> 59:47.917
I don't care about anything, even money.
I just want to live a bit.

59:48.083 --> 59:51.083
<i>But he'll never understand that.</i>

59:52.125 --> 59:54.208
<i>To live.</i>

1:00:10.458 --> 1:00:14.292
I have a very short fate line.

1:00:14.458 --> 1:00:19.042
I have a very short fate line

1:00:19.208 --> 1:00:23.458
So little fate in my hand

1:00:23.625 --> 1:00:27.333
That it scares me for the future

1:00:28.333 --> 1:00:32.333
My fate line, my fate line

1:00:32.542 --> 1:00:36.167
Tell me, darling, what do you think?

1:00:36.333 --> 1:00:39.458
What I think of it? What does it matter?

1:00:39.625 --> 1:00:43.917
I love your hip line, your hip line

1:00:45.292 --> 1:00:49.500
- My fate line!
- I love to caress it

1:00:50.750 --> 1:00:55.083
- Your hip line - My fate line!

1:00:55.250 --> 1:00:58.333
Is a flower in my garden

1:01:12.833 --> 1:01:18.000
Look at my little fate line

1:01:18.167 --> 1:01:22.250
Look at my little fate line

1:01:22.417 --> 1:01:26.583
Look at this tiny fate

1:01:26.750 --> 1:01:30.875
So tiny in the palm of my hand

1:01:31.042 --> 1:01:35.125
My fate line, my fate line

1:01:35.292 --> 1:01:39.125
Tell me, dear, what you think of it

1:01:39.292 --> 1:01:43.000
What I think of it? What does it matter?

1:01:43.167 --> 1:01:46.875
Be quiet and give me your hand

1:01:47.042 --> 1:01:50.250
- Your hip line - My fate line!

1:01:50.417 --> 1:01:53.667
Is a like a morning bird

1:01:53.833 --> 1:01:57.292
- Your hip line - My fate line!

1:01:57.458 --> 1:02:01.625
Is the frivolous bird determining our fates

1:02:21.875 --> 1:02:25.625
But still, such a tiny fate line

1:02:25.792 --> 1:02:29.917
But still, such a tiny fate line

1:02:30.042 --> 1:02:34.417
A line so tiny it barely shows

1:02:34.583 --> 1:02:39.125
No more than a dimple in my hand

1:02:39.292 --> 1:02:43.417
My fate line, my fate line

1:02:43.583 --> 1:02:47.083
Tell me, dear, what you think of it

1:02:47.250 --> 1:02:51.167
What I think of it? What does it matter?

1:02:51.333 --> 1:02:55.625
I'm crazy about you every morning

1:02:55.792 --> 1:02:58.333
- Your hip line - My fate line!

1:02:58.500 --> 1:03:01.708
A bird sings in my hands

1:03:01.875 --> 1:03:05.250
- Your line...
- My hip line

1:03:05.417 --> 1:03:08.708
- My line...
- Of fate!

1:03:10.667 --> 1:03:15.417
I may be daydreaming.

1:03:15.583 --> 1:03:19.375
She makes me think of music.

1:03:20.417 --> 1:03:22.500
Her face...

1:03:23.625 --> 1:03:29.083
We have reached the age of double men.

1:03:30.125 --> 1:03:34.792
We no longer need mirrors to talk to ourselves.

1:03:40.292 --> 1:03:46.458
When Marianne says, "It's a nice day",
what is she thinking about?

1:03:47.500 --> 1:03:54.583
All I have is an image of her saying,
"It's a nice day".

1:03:54.750 --> 1:03:56.750
Nothing more.

1:04:00.500 --> 1:04:04.250
What's the point of figuring it out?

1:04:05.958 --> 1:04:12.125
We are made of dreams and dreams are made of us.

1:04:14.292 --> 1:04:17.000
It's a nice day, my love,

1:04:17.167 --> 1:04:21.458
in dreams, words and death.

1:04:21.625 --> 1:04:26.417
It's a nice day, my love,
it's a nice day, in life.

1:05:11.917 --> 1:05:15.833
- Do you know what I'm thinking?
- I don't care.

1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:19.250
Let's not start that again!

1:05:19.417 --> 1:05:22.542
I told you to leave me alone.

1:05:23.958 --> 1:05:27.708
Besides, I'm not starting again, I'm carrying on.

1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:36.708
- Oh, shit!
- What?

1:05:48.500 --> 1:05:50.958
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

1:05:51.083 --> 1:05:53.167
What's wrong?

1:05:55.958 --> 1:06:00.458
- Do you want the plot for a novel?
- Tell me.

1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:06.292
Someone is walking round Paris
and suddenly he sees Death.

1:06:06.458 --> 1:06:09.458
So he immediately goes south to avoid him,

1:06:09.625 --> 1:06:12.167
because he thinks his time hasn't come yet.

1:06:12.333 --> 1:06:16.333
- So?
- So he drives all night, at speed,

1:06:16.500 --> 1:06:23.708
and when he reaches the sea,
he gets hit by a truck and dies,

1:06:23.875 --> 1:06:28.042
just when he thought Death had lost his trail.

1:06:45.708 --> 1:06:48.958
- Come on, let's hurry up.
- We've got plenty of time.

1:06:49.125 --> 1:06:51.208
No, I'm scared.

1:07:06.167 --> 1:07:07.792
Stay there.

1:07:11.667 --> 1:07:15.292
- Small world, isn't it?
- What do you want?

1:07:17.375 --> 1:07:20.417
- I'll be back in five minutes.
- Shall I beat him up?

1:07:20.583 --> 1:07:24.458
No, I'll make something up and get rid of him.

1:07:24.625 --> 1:07:28.458
- I must find Fred, Pierrot.
- My name's Ferdinand. OK.

1:07:28.625 --> 1:07:30.167
OK, mambo.

1:08:00.125 --> 1:08:02.958
- Two beers.
- Two?

1:08:03.125 --> 1:08:07.792
That way, when I've finished one,
I'll have the other.

1:08:19.417 --> 1:08:22.458
Don't you remember me?

1:08:22.625 --> 1:08:26.792
You stayed at my place last year,
in Fontainebleau.

1:08:26.958 --> 1:08:30.083
I lent you 100,000 francs.

1:08:31.500 --> 1:08:34.583
- You slept with my wife.
- That's right.

1:08:34.750 --> 1:08:37.500
- So now you're in the South of France?
- Yes.

1:08:37.667 --> 1:08:40.792
- How are things?
- Fine. See you.

1:09:05.333 --> 1:09:10.250
They're completely mad, you know.
Of course I'm not joking.

1:09:43.667 --> 1:09:48.875
If you don't tell me where
you stashed the money, you'll be sorry.

1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:56.083
We'll give you electric shocks,
same as during the war.

1:10:00.625 --> 1:10:04.625
Or else, like in Vietnam

1:10:07.333 --> 1:10:10.583
we'll take all your clothes off

1:10:10.750 --> 1:10:14.792
and put you in a bathtub full of napalm...

1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:23.375
...and we'll set fire to it.

1:10:27.292 --> 1:10:28.667
<i>No, right away, please.</i>

1:10:28.833 --> 1:10:32.875
<i>You can do anything you want to me.
I'll be nice to you.</i>

1:10:33.875 --> 1:10:35.250
Then hurry.

1:12:26.917 --> 1:12:30.042
<i>A glorious, noble death for a small man.</i>

1:12:59.958 --> 1:13:04.625
- What are you doing here?
- I heard some noise. I live below.

1:13:07.458 --> 1:13:09.542
Beat him up.

1:13:27.792 --> 1:13:31.292
We'll use that trick of yours.

1:13:33.792 --> 1:13:38.000
You see? We're stronger than you.

1:13:38.167 --> 1:13:41.667
What did you do with the money
that was in the car?

1:13:41.833 --> 1:13:46.792
That's it, take him into the bathroom.

1:13:57.292 --> 1:14:01.375
- Let's not forget to go see the yacht.
- There aren't any towels.

1:14:01.542 --> 1:14:04.458
Use the little whore's dress.

1:14:08.250 --> 1:14:13.167
Just press it to his face
so the water cuts off the air.

1:14:13.375 --> 1:14:16.500
I'll simplify your life and tell you all I know.

1:14:16.667 --> 1:14:20.625
Then I'll ask you a question
and I'll expect an honest answer.

1:14:20.792 --> 1:14:24.250
I know who you are. You're Ferdinand Griffon.

1:14:24.417 --> 1:14:27.875
You were with Marianne when she stabbed Donovan,

1:14:28.042 --> 1:14:32.750
and you got away
with 50,000 dollar which belong to me.

1:14:32.917 --> 1:14:35.375
I've nothing against you, personally.

1:14:35.542 --> 1:14:40.542
I'm sure Marianne dragged you into this,
but that's your business.

1:14:43.375 --> 1:14:45.958
As I was saying...

1:14:47.250 --> 1:14:51.333
I'm not interested in you -
but I need to get hold of her.

1:14:51.500 --> 1:14:54.667
Tell me where I can find her- and the money.

1:14:54.833 --> 1:14:59.375
It's your last chance.
Tell us, or we'll kill you.

1:15:20.542 --> 1:15:24.542
- The "Marquise" nightclub.
- That's either true or it's a lie.

1:15:24.708 --> 1:15:29.917
Anyway, he looks so stupid he won't
add anything. We'll go and see.

1:15:32.875 --> 1:15:37.083
- The "Marquise" nightclub.
- We'll go and see.

1:15:48.917 --> 1:15:52.042
<i>What a dreadful five o'clock.</i>

1:16:02.542 --> 1:16:06.083
<i>I don't want to look at blood.</i>

1:16:06.250 --> 1:16:09.083
<i>What a dreadful five o'clock.</i>

1:16:11.208 --> 1:16:14.333
<i>I don't want to look at blood.</i>

1:16:16.875 --> 1:16:21.833
<i>I don't want to look at blood.
What a dreadful five o'clock.</i>

1:17:25.708 --> 1:17:28.083
<i>Ferdinand turns up in the station of...</i>

1:17:28.250 --> 1:17:32.417
<i>- Toulon.
- He's staying at...</i>

1:17:32.583 --> 1:17:34.208
<i>The Little Palace Hotel.</i>

1:17:34.417 --> 1:17:39.417
<i>He's looking for Marianne.
He cannot find her. Days go by.</i>

1:17:39.583 --> 1:17:43.417
<i>Some afternoons, he sleeps in all-day movies.</i>

1:17:43.583 --> 1:17:45.667
<i>He still keeps a diary.</i>

1:17:45.875 --> 1:17:49.083
<i>For words have a strange power
to illuminate the darkness...</i>

1:17:49.250 --> 1:17:51.583
<i>Surrounding the named object...</i>

1:17:51.750 --> 1:17:53.917
<i>Even if it is degraded by everyday life.</i>

1:17:54.083 --> 1:17:58.167
<i>Language often retains only what is pure.</i>

1:17:58.708 --> 1:18:01.625
SEA

1:18:01.792 --> 1:18:05.042
SOUL

1:18:05.208 --> 1:18:07.792
BITTER

1:18:07.958 --> 1:18:09.792
WEAPON

1:19:29.125 --> 1:19:35.875
I am Princess Aicha Abadie,
and in spite of my fragile appearance,

1:19:36.042 --> 1:19:42.792
I am very strong-willed and I want to be obeyed.

1:19:42.958 --> 1:19:46.042
- What are your orders?
- I'm Lebanese by adoption.

1:19:46.208 --> 1:19:51.000
In 1960, I married EmirAbadie.

1:19:51.167 --> 1:19:58.792
I am the exiled queen of Lebanon,
since it is now a socialist republic.

1:19:58.958 --> 1:20:01.500
Sol am in Nice incognito,

1:20:01.667 --> 1:20:05.042
because my husband and I have terrible enemies

1:20:05.208 --> 1:20:08.708
and there is a price on our heads in Lebanon.

1:20:08.875 --> 1:20:14.042
I am often the target of machine-gun
fire, which always misses me,

1:20:14.208 --> 1:20:16.708
no doubt because I'm protected by Allah.

1:20:16.875 --> 1:20:21.542
To marry Emir Abadie, I had to convert to Islam.

1:20:21.708 --> 1:20:27.500
I have flown to Beirut twice
in my husband's space machine.

1:20:27.667 --> 1:20:33.042
And the witch doctor of Atlas.
Alexis, stop me from flying away.

1:20:33.208 --> 1:20:37.375
The boat is pitching,
and you know how light I am.

1:20:45.333 --> 1:20:47.958
Ferdinand, help me.

1:20:58.083 --> 1:21:01.708
- Ferdinand, we weigh anchor in an hour.
- Yes, Princess.

1:21:01.875 --> 1:21:05.208
Alexis, we're going into town.

1:21:09.417 --> 1:21:10.792
Pierrot!

1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:31.625
- It's me.
- My name is Ferdinand.

1:21:31.792 --> 1:21:33.250
Hi.

1:21:33.417 --> 1:21:36.792
You don't look surprised to see me.

1:21:36.917 --> 1:21:41.333
- What are you doing here?
- I'm happy.

1:21:41.500 --> 1:21:44.417
I've finally found you.

1:21:45.500 --> 1:21:48.708
- Where do you live now?
- With you, you fool.

1:21:48.875 --> 1:21:53.667
I'll be living with you.
I've been looking for you everywhere.

1:21:57.542 --> 1:22:02.500
- Why didn't you wait for me?
- I wanted to.

1:22:02.667 --> 1:22:05.917
I managed to get away before they arrived.

1:22:06.083 --> 1:22:09.792
I ran to the nightclub
to warn you not to come over,

1:22:09.958 --> 1:22:12.208
but I didn't find you.

1:22:12.333 --> 1:22:18.125
So I went back and saw those men
getting into the blue Ford.

1:22:18.292 --> 1:22:21.208
I thought they'd killed you.

1:22:22.458 --> 1:22:28.083
So I went away. I don't even know where I went.

1:22:28.250 --> 1:22:31.750
But I was afraid of going back to the seaside.

1:22:31.917 --> 1:22:37.542
And then one day, I ran into Fred,
in Toulon, in a bar,

1:22:37.708 --> 1:22:41.125
the Las Vegas bar, in Toulon.

1:22:41.292 --> 1:22:45.625
- How did you find out I was here?
- By accident.

1:22:45.792 --> 1:22:48.375
It's true, you know.

1:22:50.208 --> 1:22:52.375
I believe you, you liar.

1:22:52.542 --> 1:22:57.625
Why won't you ever believe I love you?
I love you in my own way.

1:22:57.792 --> 1:22:59.875
Yes, that's true.

1:23:00.042 --> 1:23:01.458
I'll prove it.

1:23:01.625 --> 1:23:06.167
Look. Yesterday, I went to our beach
and picked up your journal.

1:23:06.333 --> 1:23:08.042
Thank you.

1:23:08.208 --> 1:23:11.458
Look at the last page.

1:23:11.625 --> 1:23:15.333
I wrote a little poem about you.

1:23:15.500 --> 1:23:18.542
"Tender and cruel,

1:23:18.708 --> 1:23:22.125
real and surreal,

1:23:22.333 --> 1:23:25.333
terrifying and funny,

1:23:25.500 --> 1:23:28.583
nocturnal and diurnal,

1:23:28.750 --> 1:23:33.583
usual and unusual, as handsome as anything..."

1:23:33.750 --> 1:23:36.542
- Pierrot is mad!
- My name is Ferdinand.

1:23:36.708 --> 1:23:42.042
- Stop bugging me, damn it!
- If you think saying that suits you...

1:23:42.208 --> 1:23:46.542
- God, too, can go to...
- Don't talk like that.

1:23:46.708 --> 1:23:51.042
Listen to her! We're wanted for murder.
Do you know what that is?

1:23:51.208 --> 1:23:55.375
Of course I do. So what? Does it scare you?

1:23:56.417 --> 1:23:58.083
Answer me.

1:23:58.250 --> 1:24:02.292
I look at you, I listen to you,
but that's not what matters.

1:24:02.458 --> 1:24:05.792
- Thanks.
- No, I mean, at this very moment.

1:24:05.958 --> 1:24:07.958
Well, it has already passed.

1:24:08.125 --> 1:24:13.792
Our relationship
is a bit like the blue of the sky.

1:24:13.958 --> 1:24:16.917
I don't understand.

1:24:17.083 --> 1:24:19.875
I'd like time to stand still.

1:24:20.042 --> 1:24:26.083
When I put my hand on your knee,
that, in itself, is wonderful.

1:24:26.250 --> 1:24:30.875
That's what life is about: space, feelings.

1:24:32.750 --> 1:24:37.042
Instead, I'm going to follow you back
to our tale of sound and fury.

1:24:37.208 --> 1:24:40.500
- Actually, I don't care.
- Come on, Fred's waiting for us.

1:24:40.667 --> 1:24:43.583
All right, never mind. Let's go.

1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:50.542
What are the police up to?
We should have been in jail long ago.

1:24:50.667 --> 1:24:54.833
They're clever.
They let people destroy themselves.

1:25:23.292 --> 1:25:29.375
- Why do you do things like that?
- I keep telling you I didn't kill him.

1:25:45.333 --> 1:25:47.958
It's funny to be alive, when so many have died.

1:25:48.167 --> 1:25:49.792
Oh, yes, it's funny.

1:25:49.958 --> 1:25:53.875
- This is like the set of <i>Pépé le Moko.</i>
- Who?

1:25:54.042 --> 1:25:56.292
- <i>Pépe' le Moko.</i>
- Who is he?

1:25:56.458 --> 1:25:59.583
You really don't know anything.

1:26:04.500 --> 1:26:09.000
- Do you know what you are?
- A sexual man.

1:26:10.292 --> 1:26:16.458
As if. I know who you are, but you don't.

1:26:16.625 --> 1:26:22.958
It's true. I'm just a big question mark
overlooking the Mediterranean.

1:26:39.792 --> 1:26:44.875
- Are your parents still alive?
- Yes, and they've never been separated.

1:26:45.042 --> 1:26:48.250
They were almost parted, once.

1:26:48.375 --> 1:26:54.083
Dad was going on a trip,
I don't know where. A small trip.

1:26:54.250 --> 1:26:57.833
They didn't have enough money for two tickets.

1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:01.125
Mum accompanied him to the bus.

1:27:01.292 --> 1:27:07.625
And then they looked at each other:
she was below, he was at the window.

1:27:07.792 --> 1:27:11.958
And just as the bus started, dad quickly got off.

1:27:12.125 --> 1:27:14.375
He didn't want to leave my mother.

1:27:14.542 --> 1:27:19.625
And while he was getting off, she was
getting on through the other door.

1:27:19.792 --> 1:27:24.833
She didn't want to leave my father.
In the end, he didn't go on the trip.

1:27:25.042 --> 1:27:27.833
What did you do when you worked in that lift?

1:27:27.958 --> 1:27:31.792
Nothing much. I looked at people's faces.

1:27:31.958 --> 1:27:36.583
- Where was that?
- At the Galeries Lafayette.

1:27:36.750 --> 1:27:40.958
- Why so many questions?
- I'm trying to figure you out.

1:27:41.125 --> 1:27:44.458
I never could, even five years ago.

1:27:44.625 --> 1:27:47.875
I'm a very sentimental person, that's all.

1:27:48.042 --> 1:27:51.292
One has to be pretty stupid
to find that mysterious.

1:27:51.458 --> 1:27:57.500
What does your brother do, exactly?
I never know if you're making stuff up.

1:27:57.667 --> 1:28:02.333
- Oh, my brother...
- What was he doing in Tel Aviv?

1:28:04.542 --> 1:28:07.750
At the moment, there's a war going on in Yemen.

1:28:07.917 --> 1:28:10.875
You really don't know anything.

1:28:11.042 --> 1:28:14.167
He gets money from the royalist government.

1:28:14.333 --> 1:28:17.583
Do the others work for the Arab League?

1:28:17.750 --> 1:28:22.417
- I don't know. Probably.
- Is there really a dancing troupe?

1:28:22.583 --> 1:28:24.208
What's it to you?

1:28:24.375 --> 1:28:29.667
Why does he need a front?
Arms dealing is almost legal these days.

1:28:29.833 --> 1:28:32.542
- What's it to you?
- Just answer.

1:28:32.708 --> 1:28:35.333
I'll tell you something.

1:28:35.500 --> 1:28:40.208
There are 3,600 seconds in an hour.

1:28:41.250 --> 1:28:46.167
That's about 100,000 seconds per day.

1:28:46.333 --> 1:28:49.583
In an average lifetime, that makes...

1:28:51.083 --> 1:28:54.417
250 billion seconds.

1:28:55.708 --> 1:29:00.667
Since we've known each other,
we've spent a month together.

1:29:01.708 --> 1:29:07.458
If we add it all together, I've only
been with you for a few million seconds

1:29:07.625 --> 1:29:11.708
out of the 250 billion
that go to make up your life.

1:29:11.875 --> 1:29:13.333
It's not much.

1:29:13.500 --> 1:29:18.333
So it's hardly surprising
I barely know who he is either.

1:29:41.208 --> 1:29:44.875
- Is he willing to do it?
- He'll do anything I want.

1:29:45.042 --> 1:29:47.625
Oh, what a mess!

1:29:47.792 --> 1:29:50.792
- You know...
- Six, seven, eight.

1:29:50.958 --> 1:29:54.833
- You're doing well!
- One, two, three, four, five...

1:30:13.292 --> 1:30:15.125
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:30:18.500 --> 1:30:21.375
- Here you go.
- What am I supposed to do?

1:30:21.542 --> 1:30:26.542
- You'll do what you're told.
- Just keep your eyes and ears open.

1:30:28.083 --> 1:30:31.542
Remember the scent of eucalyptus?

1:30:31.708 --> 1:30:34.792
<i>- Nothing's simple with you.
- Everything is.</i>

1:30:34.958 --> 1:30:37.500
<i>Too much happens at once.</i>

1:30:37.667 --> 1:30:43.042
<i>- A small harbour, as in Conrad.
- A boat, as in Robert Louis Stevenson.</i>

1:30:43.208 --> 1:30:49.417
<i>- An old brothel, as in Faulkner.
- A rich steward, as in Jack London.</i>

1:30:50.583 --> 1:30:53.292
<i>- Nothing's simple with you.
- Everything is.</i>

1:30:53.458 --> 1:30:55.542
<i>Too much happens at once.</i>

1:30:55.708 --> 1:31:00.292
<i>Here are two men who beat me up,
as in Raymond Chandler.</i>

1:31:00.458 --> 1:31:03.833
<i>And you, and me, and him. See how simple it is?</i>

1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:06.583
<i>- No.
- They want to buy the yacht.</i>

1:31:06.708 --> 1:31:09.917
<i>The old man isn't French.
My brother collects the money.</i>

1:31:10.083 --> 1:31:15.000
<i>The others will be furious.
We must get rid of them.</i>

1:31:15.167 --> 1:31:17.375
<i>- And then?
- You'll do as you're told.</i>

1:31:49.292 --> 1:31:51.042
<i>A woman can kill lots of people.</i>

1:31:51.208 --> 1:31:54.208
<i>There's no reason why soft breasts and thighs</i>

1:31:54.375 --> 1:31:59.167
<i>should keep her from killing everybody
to stay free or defend herself.</i>

1:31:59.333 --> 1:32:03.167
<i>Consider Cuba, Vietnam, Israel...</i>

1:32:18.833 --> 1:32:22.125
- I love you.
- Me too.

1:33:29.875 --> 1:33:32.958
<i>Following chapter: despair.</i>

1:33:33.125 --> 1:33:37.625
<i>Following chapter: hope, bitterness.</i>

1:33:56.417 --> 1:33:58.458
So tell me...

1:33:58.583 --> 1:34:03.083
Have you seen a young woman
who looks like a film star?

1:34:03.250 --> 1:34:06.167
That's none of your business.

1:34:09.750 --> 1:34:11.708
- Is it all there?
- Yes.

1:34:11.875 --> 1:34:15.500
- We all meet tonight as planned?
- Yes.

1:34:19.917 --> 1:34:22.833
- Some people saw me.
- You fool.

1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:26.792
- I don't understand.
- That way, Fred will look innocent.

1:34:26.958 --> 1:34:29.542
Why are you betraying me?

1:34:32.583 --> 1:34:38.042
- What's up?
- Nothing. You're making me suffer.

1:34:38.167 --> 1:34:41.625
But, Pierrot,
50,000 dollar is worth worrying about.

1:34:41.792 --> 1:34:45.708
My name is Ferdinand.
Why did you kiss me earlier?

1:34:45.875 --> 1:34:48.458
I felt like it.

1:34:50.667 --> 1:34:53.958
- Kiss me again.
- Not in front of everyone.

1:34:56.042 --> 1:35:00.458
Why do you wear such tight trousers?

1:35:00.625 --> 1:35:03.958
If you don't like it, you can go back to Paris.

1:35:04.125 --> 1:35:06.042
Kiss me.

1:35:06.208 --> 1:35:11.250
All right, I get it.
Betraying us isn't a good idea.

1:35:11.417 --> 1:35:13.125
<i>Be quiet, Cassandra.</i>

1:35:13.292 --> 1:35:15.667
- What?
- It's the title of this novel.

1:35:15.875 --> 1:35:18.083
You poor fool.

1:35:20.292 --> 1:35:21.667
Listen!

1:35:23.333 --> 1:35:25.792
- What?
- TWA.

1:35:25.958 --> 1:35:30.375
Nice-Tahiti. 14:45.
A flight. We just have to catch it.

1:35:30.542 --> 1:35:34.708
- Just the two of us, obviously.
- Yes, obviously.

1:35:41.083 --> 1:35:43.417
Obviously.

1:35:43.583 --> 1:35:48.542
French words say the opposite of what they mean.

1:35:48.708 --> 1:35:52.208
We say "obviously" when things aren't obvious.

1:35:52.375 --> 1:35:59.583
Yep, I can't say I was expecting to find
the old man with a bullet in his head.

1:35:59.750 --> 1:36:03.583
- Did you know your brother'd kill him?
- It's none of my business.

1:36:03.750 --> 1:36:09.375
I don't mind leaving, but Fred
will track us down and get even.

1:36:09.542 --> 1:36:14.375
- I saw him get even with a girl once.
- I'll protect you.

1:36:17.292 --> 1:36:20.458
Fine, but I must go alone or he'll be suspicious.

1:36:20.625 --> 1:36:23.750
- OK, beautiful.
- OK, handsome.

1:36:27.083 --> 1:36:31.625
I'm off, since we've nothing further
to say to each other.

1:36:31.792 --> 1:36:35.667
- Meet up with me in half an hour.
- No.

1:36:35.833 --> 1:36:39.625
I'll count up to... 137.

1:36:41.917 --> 1:36:44.583
You really are mad.

1:36:49.042 --> 1:36:52.417
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten...

1:36:52.542 --> 1:36:55.583
- ...11,12,13,14,15...
- What about the case?

1:36:55.750 --> 1:37:00.250
Start the car. Trust me,
and I'll trust you. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,

1:37:00.417 --> 1:37:05.458
23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29... 30.

1:37:05.625 --> 1:37:11.292
31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,

1:37:11.500 --> 1:37:16.583
41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47...

1:37:16.750 --> 1:37:26.625
...49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58...

1:37:38.958 --> 1:37:44.500
...71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76...

1:37:44.625 --> 1:37:50.875
<i>...78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84,</i>

1:37:51.083 --> 1:37:58.042
<i>85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90... 100, 101,</i>

1:37:58.167 --> 1:38:03.542
<i>102,103,104,105,106,107,108...</i>

1:39:14.208 --> 1:39:18.792
- You all right, old man?
- It's... it's that tune.

1:39:18.958 --> 1:39:23.000
You can't imagine what it means to me.
Can you hear it?

1:39:23.167 --> 1:39:26.042
Nope, I can't hear a thing.

1:39:26.208 --> 1:39:30.375
You wouldn't understand.
That tune's my whole life.

1:39:30.542 --> 1:39:35.708
My whole life!
When I hear it, it really affects me.

1:39:35.875 --> 1:39:40.042
One day, when I was at home, it was playing...

1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:50.125
She was next to me...
A magnificent woman, she was...

1:39:51.792 --> 1:39:58.750
I took her hand and began to caress it.
Like that.

1:39:58.917 --> 1:40:03.708
I asked her: "Do you love me?"

1:40:05.917 --> 1:40:09.375
And she said: "No". She said no.

1:40:09.542 --> 1:40:14.208
So I bought the record, because the music had...

1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:19.083
It was mass hysteria - though I was on my own.

1:40:19.250 --> 1:40:23.292
And then, one day, I put the record on.

1:40:25.250 --> 1:40:28.792
It was going round and round
and round in my head.

1:40:28.958 --> 1:40:31.292
Everything was spinning!

1:40:31.500 --> 1:40:34.875
And there was a woman next to me -
a different one.

1:40:35.042 --> 1:40:38.167
She wasn't as beautiful. She was...

1:40:40.083 --> 1:40:47.250
In any case, I took her hand. I stroked
her palm for the sake of change,

1:40:47.417 --> 1:40:50.917
otherwise it'd have been dull.

1:40:51.083 --> 1:40:55.750
I asked her: "Do you love me?"

1:40:57.750 --> 1:41:00.875
And she said: "Yeah".

1:41:03.125 --> 1:41:07.292
But I didn't love her,
so I broke the record and...

1:41:09.833 --> 1:41:13.625
One day, I turned on the radio
and this was playing.

1:41:13.792 --> 1:41:18.167
This! Why couldn't they play something else?

1:41:18.333 --> 1:41:22.667
She was next to me - on the other side,
because I was at her place.

1:41:22.833 --> 1:41:25.708
It was a third woman.

1:41:25.875 --> 1:41:30.875
I took her hand and caressed it
on both sides, just to get it over with.

1:41:31.042 --> 1:41:34.417
The whole thing was beginning to bug me.

1:41:34.583 --> 1:41:38.333
I asked her: "Do you love me?"

1:41:39.625 --> 1:41:43.750
She replied: "Yes, sir."

1:41:43.917 --> 1:41:46.792
I asked her: "May I have your hand?"

1:41:46.958 --> 1:41:50.042
She said: "You've been holding it
for ten minutes."

1:41:50.208 --> 1:41:53.333
I said: "Yes, that's true", and added...

1:41:57.083 --> 1:41:59.167
Ten years.

1:42:00.333 --> 1:42:04.833
Ten years! Ten years!
I can't take that tune any more!

1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:09.583
Do you hear it?
I can't stand it any more! Hear it?

1:42:09.750 --> 1:42:11.125
No.

1:42:11.292 --> 1:42:14.167
It was right there. Couldn't you hear it?

1:42:14.333 --> 1:42:16.333
No, I couldn't.

1:42:16.500 --> 1:42:20.583
Tell me... Well,
just come out and say that I'm crazy.

1:42:20.750 --> 1:42:24.792
I'd like to hear you say: "You're crazy." Say it!

1:42:24.958 --> 1:42:28.083
- You're crazy.
- That's better.

1:42:37.333 --> 1:42:39.417
- Going to the island?
- Yes, sir.

1:42:39.625 --> 1:42:43.250
- What's your boat called?
- The Wassup?

1:42:43.417 --> 1:42:46.167
I'll pay the same fare if it's down.

1:42:56.500 --> 1:43:00.375
Are you trying to say
the tune I hear doesn't exist?

1:43:00.542 --> 1:43:03.375
The tune that has pursued me all my life?

1:43:03.542 --> 1:43:07.875
That tenderness? insensitive man!

1:43:08.042 --> 1:43:10.958
<i>Can you hear me? You've understood nothing!</i>

1:43:35.583 --> 1:43:38.125
Do you love me?

1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:29.833
<i>I held her against me and started to cry.</i>

1:44:30.042 --> 1:44:33.458
<i>It was our first, our only dream.</i>

1:44:56.833 --> 1:45:01.542
I'd like to put in a call to Paris. Balzac 7502.

1:45:03.167 --> 1:45:06.833
You've forgotten who Balzac is too?

1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:09.583
Yes, I'll hold the line.

1:45:18.125 --> 1:45:20.125
It hurts.

1:45:22.458 --> 1:45:25.583
You brought it on yourself.

1:45:34.042 --> 1:45:40.667
- Please give me some water.
- You brought it on yourself.

1:45:44.667 --> 1:45:47.833
I'm sorry, Pierrot.

1:45:47.958 --> 1:45:51.667
My name is Ferdinand. It's too late.

1:46:15.250 --> 1:46:16.625
Yes?

1:46:18.542 --> 1:46:20.583
Yes, I'll hold.

1:46:33.667 --> 1:46:36.875
Balzac 7502?

1:46:37.042 --> 1:46:41.083
Is Mrs Griffon there?

1:46:41.250 --> 1:46:43.042
Who is that?

1:46:43.167 --> 1:46:45.917
Odile?

1:46:46.083 --> 1:46:48.667
How are the children?

1:46:49.708 --> 1:46:52.625
No, nobody's calling.

1:47:36.917 --> 1:47:39.583
What I wanted to say...

1:47:43.917 --> 1:47:45.333
...or why...

1:48:46.542 --> 1:48:49.458
What an idiot I'm being. Shit, shit...

1:49:29.583 --> 1:49:31.250
<i>- It's ours again.
- What?</i>

1:49:31.417 --> 1:49:33.708
<i>- Eternity.
- It's just the sea.</i>

1:49:33.875 --> 1:49:35.958
<i>And the sun.</i>
