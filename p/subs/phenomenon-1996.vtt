03:13.568 --> 03:17.948
Attila? Where are you, boy?
Did you get that rabbit? Did you?

03:18.281 --> 03:24.209
I'll bet you did. My mighty hunter.
You vicious killer. That's my dog.

03:24.287 --> 03:27.917
That's my beast!
Come on, give me a kiss.

03:40.053 --> 03:44.399
Wait a minute. Wait a damn minute.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.978
Attila? And you call yourself security?

03:52.649 --> 03:54.651
Don't change the subject.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.669
Hey, George.

04:06.997 --> 04:09.420
You gonna just stand there or are you
gonna help me with these boxes?

04:09.499 --> 04:12.173
Now what have you got me carrying?

04:12.294 --> 04:14.422
Got a deal on solar panels
and batteries.

04:14.963 --> 04:18.183
Well, I told you I wasn't doing
any more improvements on the house

04:18.257 --> 04:21.512
- I'm selling this place someday.
- Yeah, right.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.347
But I see you improved
the garden anyway.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.024
Yeah, and that goddamn rabbit
still got in there.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.695
I told you
he went under your fence, George.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.193
- He did not.
- He did, too!

04:32.272 --> 04:35.116
I put that fence a foot and a half
underneath the ground.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.529
Well, it's a mystery, George.

04:39.196 --> 04:44.202
Anyway, this solar outfit, it's going to
save you money and it's free.

04:45.869 --> 04:49.544
- So happy birthday.
- Thanks, Nate. Thank you.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.548
- Who's gonna put it together?
- Not me.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.808
It comes with a manual
in three different languages.

05:00.884 --> 05:04.013
Forget it. Look, if it's a car I can fix it.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.722
If it's in the garden
I probably can grow it.

05:05.806 --> 05:09.982
But this is way out
of my neighborhood.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.488
Hey, are you bringing a date tonight?

05:13.563 --> 05:14.985
No. You?

05:16.274 --> 05:18.447
Well, I'm thinking of asking somebody.

05:18.568 --> 05:22.664
When? Today? You don't give them
much notice, do you?

05:22.739 --> 05:25.288
Well, you even ask anybody?

05:25.408 --> 05:29.333
I always ask Diana Ross,
but she never says yes to me.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.000
- See you.
- See you later.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.689
Hey, Bill!

05:59.150 --> 06:01.278
Hey, George.
George, I forgot to tell you, man.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.285
Hold on, hold on.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.459
Doctor called.

06:07.951 --> 06:10.170
Banes, will you let me figure it out?

06:13.039 --> 06:16.293
At 10300. At 10:00. At 10100.

06:29.598 --> 06:31.976
- He wants you to look at his window.
- Man!

06:41.610 --> 06:45.365
How're you doing, Lace?
You look great.

06:45.655 --> 06:50.331
- Yeah. How are the chairs selling?
- I got one left. I need four more.

06:52.162 --> 06:55.416
Wow. It's going a lot better
than I expected.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.842
Yeah, well, you know,
people sit down a lot around here.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.170
Yeah.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.220
- Here, I can get these.
- No, I got it, thanks.

07:01.296 --> 07:04.596
Well, I'll help you.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.687
Hey, Lace, there's a party tonight
at the Elkhorn Bar...

07:09.763 --> 07:12.061
Why do they call it that?
There's no elk around here.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.188
I don't know.
They just always called it the Elkhorn.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.941
Why? They got some poor elk's horn
hanging over the bar?

07:17.020 --> 07:18.613
I don't think so.

07:19.272 --> 07:23.778
Anyway, it's my birthday today, and
there's a party tonight at the Elkhorn.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.407
- I said that, didn't I?
- Yeah.

07:25.487 --> 07:29.208
- George!
- I gotta look up here at 10:00.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.456
- Why'?
- Well, that's Doc Brunder's office.

07:31.534 --> 07:34.003
- Have you met him yet?
- No. What does he want?

07:34.079 --> 07:35.422
I don't know.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.425
So, hey, you think
you could come to the party tonight?

07:38.500 --> 07:40.753
No, I don't like to leave my kids
home alone at night.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.553
- I know a good babysitter.
- I just live really far...

07:42.629 --> 07:44.597
Tito's wife. You know Tito. Tito? Tito!

07:45.423 --> 07:49.348
- Hey, George.
- Hey, that's nice.

07:52.347 --> 07:53.724
Oh, God.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.982
- So that's the doctor?
- Yep, that's the doctor.

08:02.691 --> 08:05.820
- Would you please come tonight?
- No, not tonight.

08:08.571 --> 08:12.576
- Is it me'?
- No, it's not you.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.661
Well, then I'll keep asking.

08:18.081 --> 08:21.005
Man, I would love to get my hands
on your carburetor.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.094
I bet you would.

08:30.844 --> 08:34.144
- You say, "She sock it to you."
- Yeah, get back to work, guys.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.787
Hey, Nate. Nate.

08:52.866 --> 08:56.211
It's a scandal, you and Diana Ross.
I told the press.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.583
- Oh, man.
- Yup.

08:57.787 --> 09:01.291
She'd be so happy on my farm.
No stress.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.968
- It's true.
- No media, no press.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.387
- Nothing.
- Just heaven.

09:05.462 --> 09:08.136
Hey, you're not supposed to be
buying drinks tonight.

09:08.757 --> 09:09.974
- Yo!

09:10.050 --> 09:11.893
George doesn't buy drinks tonight.
It's his birthday.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.312
- Hey, Doc! Hey, you made it!
- For you.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.105
Hey, hi!

09:16.598 --> 09:17.645
- How's everybody?
- Hey.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.564
Still breathing in and out?

09:19.642 --> 09:21.644
Hey, Doc, you gotta try this.
You got to try that cake.

09:21.728 --> 09:24.402
- What?
- Tito's wife made it. It is macho bueno.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.154
- Macho.
- As usual.

09:26.441 --> 09:27.988
Doc. Thank you.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.156
- Hey, Jimmy!
- You're welcome.

09:30.445 --> 09:31.742
You're learning the moves, George,

09:31.821 --> 09:33.823
but you've never played
amidst turmoil and confusion.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.746
So, here we go.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.668
I wish we could go back to checkers.
Maybe I could win.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.255
No, no, no. You have potential, George.

09:40.330 --> 09:43.254
I always said George Malley has
something extra to offer this world.

09:43.333 --> 09:46.303
I said that the day I circumcised you.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.757
- He says that every birthday.
- It was a bad joke, I know.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.425
You know you ruined my chance
of romance today

09:52.509 --> 09:54.853
- with that obscene stunt in the window.
- It was an outrage.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.266
- It was a disgrace!
- It was a criminal act.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.440
Okay, there was a beautiful girl
who walked right away from me.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.517
- It was so embarrassing.
- George, you talking about the one

10:00.642 --> 10:02.360
- with the chairs?
- Yeah.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.855
- They are not all that comfortable.
- Well, I think they're perfect.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.691
- But you gotta learn how to sit in them.
- Here you go.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.534
On the house, everybody.
Happy birthday!

10:09.651 --> 10:11.870
Jimmy. Jimmy, there's no
smoking section in heaven, you know.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.039
Come on. Don't start, Doc, don't start.

10:14.864 --> 10:18.368
- Pass those out. Here <i>pass</i> them out.
- Georgie, happy cumpleafios, amigo.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.543
<i>Happy cumpleafios.</i>

10:19.619 --> 10:21.121
Hey, buddy, cheers.

10:21.204 --> 10:23.047
- Happy birthday.
- We love you, man.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.461
- You all set?
- Yeah.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.043
This is great.

10:26.584 --> 10:27.881
This is great.

10:28.419 --> 10:31.389
Tito, wait, wait, wait. Tito!

10:32.090 --> 10:34.058
Thanks for coming to my party, man.

10:34.926 --> 10:38.180
- Happy birthday, kid.
- Yeah, happy birthday.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.730
Yup, happy birthday.

10:54.070 --> 10:57.700
Thirty-seven. Thirty-seven.

11:45.163 --> 11:48.258
Anybody see that'? That light?

11:48.333 --> 11:50.085
- What kind of light?
- You know, there was a noise.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.091
- Did you hear it?
- No.

11:52.170 --> 11:53.968
Could we finish the game, George?

11:55.632 --> 12:00.889
Man, it was like an explosion,
and there was a flash.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.143
- Like a plane?
- No, it was bigger than that.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.896
I mean it was farther away.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.272
You mean like a star, George?

12:07.810 --> 12:10.689
- Man, it knocked me off my feet.
- You fell?

12:10.772 --> 12:13.195
Yeah, I fell! I was hit right

12:14.192 --> 12:17.492
- The man's inebriated.
- I warned you.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.289
- I am not drunk, Nate.
- I'm taking your queen, George.

12:20.365 --> 12:24.495
- Now pay attention.
- Isn't that checkmate?

12:25.536 --> 12:30.542
- That's checkmate, isn't it?
- You mean he beat you?

12:31.167 --> 12:33.295
You let him win, Doc?
Birthday present?

12:33.378 --> 12:35.096
I didn't let him win anything.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.133
You're a little pissed off about that,
aren't you'?

12:38.341 --> 12:40.435
- Play another one?
- You can get your revenge on me

12:40.510 --> 12:41.978
- tomorrow, all right?
- Yeah.

12:42.053 --> 12:43.430
- You feeling okay?
- Yeah.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.436
- Can you drive, George?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

12:45.515 --> 12:49.565
- Hey, thanks, everybody.
- Happy birthday, buddy.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.571
- Happy birthday, George.
- That was a good party.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.217
I can't sleep.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.178
That's it!

13:31.352 --> 13:33.446
- What?
- I figured it out.

13:33.521 --> 13:36.491
Jesus, George,
what are you doing calling me? It's late.

13:36.566 --> 13:39.536
I thought that farmers got up
when it was still dark.

13:39.610 --> 13:44.332
That's if you have cows.
I don't have any cows, George.

13:44.407 --> 13:48.082
Now, look, there's only one explanation
for that rabbit.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.959
- What?
- You see, when I built that fence

13:50.038 --> 13:52.382
higher and deeper,
he was already in there.

13:52.457 --> 13:55.677
See, he was hiding. I fenced him in.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.213
<i>There's only one thing I can do now,</i>

13:58.296 --> 14:01.846
<i>- just let</i> him out.
- Good night, George. Good night.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.823
Here's Roger.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.996
George, can I have my Bronco back?

15:05.071 --> 15:07.915
I don't have any cash right now,
but I need my car.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.994
Well, I need some solar panels
installed on my roof.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.750
I don't know anything about solar.

15:12.829 --> 15:16.299
Well, Charlie Shipper does, and
he needs a well dug on his property.

15:16.374 --> 15:20.254
You help him dig the well, he'll help me
with the panels, and I'll fix your car.

15:20.336 --> 15:23.840
- Deal?
- Yeah, deal!

15:25.842 --> 15:27.685
I'll call Charlie.

15:29.011 --> 15:33.141
- Hi. I just called about fixing my brakes.
- Yeah, yeah. Be right with you.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.483
Tito.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.323
- Come on.
- Tito,

15:48.406 --> 15:50.454
he speaks Spanish
better than I do now.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.831
Yeah, better than me, too.

16:28.863 --> 16:32.288
Right. Where's the owner and operator
of this vehicle?

16:32.366 --> 16:34.744
- You a cop?
- Our mom's in the store.

16:35.411 --> 16:36.503
Mmm-hmm.

16:36.579 --> 16:39.082
- You got the brake on, sport?
- His name's Al.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.543
- And what's your name?
- Glory.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.428
Well, I'm George.

16:44.504 --> 16:48.429
- Pop the hood, AI.
- Why?

16:49.550 --> 16:52.269
- You know how to start this thing?
- Duh.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.394
Emergency road service, ma'am.

16:56.474 --> 16:58.397
Your truck can't breathe,
and your idle's too fast.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.729
Sorry. Gotta go.

17:00.937 --> 17:03.656
Where? You're not leaving town,
are you?

17:03.731 --> 17:05.825
No, just San Francisco for the day.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.869
I used to live there. Ask me directions
on where you're going.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.039
As a matter of fact,
ask me anything at all.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.992
You could even ask me to come along.
I'd show you the sights, the hazards.

17:14.075 --> 17:16.669
- What do you think?
- I think your idle's too fast.

17:17.328 --> 17:18.454
San Francisco?

17:18.621 --> 17:21.170
- But you were born here, right?
- How'd you know I was born here?

17:21.249 --> 17:25.550
Just now in the store someone said,
"I've known George Malley all my life,

17:25.627 --> 17:27.847
"and if he said he saw a UFO,
he saw one."

17:29.715 --> 17:32.559
- I didn't say that.
- You saw one?

17:32.635 --> 17:36.640
- But I didn't say what I saw.
- What'd it look like?

17:36.722 --> 17:38.474
Well, it could've been.

17:42.520 --> 17:46.024
- That's mate, Doc.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. George!

17:46.107 --> 17:49.407
Now, what in the hell is going on here?
What?

17:50.111 --> 17:53.115
Look, you know, I don't know, Doc.
I really don't know.

17:53.197 --> 17:56.497
Just lately, I've been seeing things
so clearly, you know.

17:56.659 --> 18:01.540
And, you know,
I understand right away. I concentrate.

18:02.957 --> 18:06.427
And books, I can't stop feeding myself.
I read two, three books a day.

18:06.502 --> 18:11.724
Imagine that. And then, you know,
I can't stop, and I can't sleep.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.935
You know, ever since the...

18:17.638 --> 18:20.107
I gotta go. Get back to work.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.981
- Ever since...
- The sighting.

18:23.811 --> 18:27.941
- Roger, it was a damn light.
- And a boom.

18:28.024 --> 18:30.447
- Now, did you hear it?
- Well, no.

18:31.569 --> 18:34.789
Anybody? About nine days ago
right outside here?

18:34.864 --> 18:38.585
Was that 12:00, George?

18:38.659 --> 18:40.912
George, come in for a physical, okay?

18:47.084 --> 18:48.301
George?

18:49.378 --> 18:52.302
- Two or three books a day?
- At least.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.888
- About what?
- About everything.

18:55.217 --> 18:58.141
You know, all the things
I've wanted to know about and learn.

18:58.220 --> 19:01.349
- Like what?
- Well, you tell me, Rog.

19:01.432 --> 19:04.811
I mean, what have you always wanted
to know about and learn, hmm?

19:07.563 --> 19:08.906
Think about it.

20:41.031 --> 20:46.754
CQ, this is WB-6. QLF, standing
by. Searcher out of Harmon, California.

20:46.829 --> 20:48.581
Is anybody in the void tonight?

20:48.664 --> 20:52.794
I'm looking for Diana Ross, but I'll
accept any voice in the English tongue.

20:54.170 --> 20:58.425
Is that you, Diana? Hey, George.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.602
Look, Nate,
you haven't sat till you've put your ass

21:01.677 --> 21:03.600
on one of these homemade
willow chairs, okay?

21:03.679 --> 21:05.556
Now, I brought you a pair
so you can put your feet up,

21:05.681 --> 21:07.900
or if you want a friend to sit in there,

21:08.017 --> 21:11.521
if you decide one day and invite
someone over. What do you think?

21:13.856 --> 21:16.405
- I don't think they go, George.
- What would you know?

21:16.525 --> 21:21.076
Looks like a swap meet blew in here.
Talk about needing a woman's touch.

21:21.197 --> 21:23.325
This is an emergency.

21:23.407 --> 21:26.331
Hey, Nate, I've been working
on that solar kit you gave me.

21:26.410 --> 21:30.756
I am telling you, the whole field of
photovoltaics is just in baby land.

21:30.873 --> 21:34.628
I mean, you know,
the idea that plants have been storing

21:34.710 --> 21:37.884
and using the sun's energy
since the birth of the world,

21:37.963 --> 21:40.386
I mean,
photosynthesis is a model for us.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.468
And we're just scratching the surface
of what we could do

21:42.551 --> 21:45.771
with these silicon cells, I'm telling you.

21:46.222 --> 21:47.394
What?

21:50.893 --> 21:52.315
What?

21:52.394 --> 21:55.739
You just talk so fast, George,
and you know so much stuff.

21:56.398 --> 22:01.996
- I'm sorry. But I can't help it, Nate.
- That's okay.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.334
What is that?

22:06.408 --> 22:07.876
It's just computers
talking to computers...

22:07.952 --> 22:09.420
Leave it, leave it, leave it.

22:09.495 --> 22:12.169
Come on, the Morse code is
going too fast for you to pick that out.

22:12.248 --> 22:15.252
- No, no, no, no, I can hear it.
- Bull.

22:15.334 --> 22:19.384
No, I'll tell you what it is, a repeated
pattern. They're looping a message.

22:19.463 --> 22:23.184
"Watering the golds Friday."

22:23.259 --> 22:24.385
Yeah, yeah.

22:24.468 --> 22:27.563
Now who'd be sending a coded
message like that in simple Morse?

22:27.638 --> 22:30.892
Oh, man, look, I pick up like
two different Air Force bases.

22:30.975 --> 22:32.943
I think we better leave
this one alone, George.

22:33.018 --> 22:35.396
No, no, this is a different one!
Listen, listen.

22:35.479 --> 22:39.859
This one's much denser, but it's still
a loop. It still repeats. Listen.

22:40.985 --> 22:42.828
- Seriously, I think we...
- I got to record this.

22:42.945 --> 22:44.492
- Where's your...
- I think we need to leave this alone.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.581
- No, no, no, no, Nate.
- What are you doing?

22:46.657 --> 22:48.455
Well, I want to take it home
so I can break it down.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.662
- Then we can answer it.
- Why?

22:51.036 --> 22:55.166
Because it gives me something
to do, Nate. All right?

22:58.460 --> 23:00.588
I don't know if it's getting worse
or it's getting better,

23:00.671 --> 23:04.517
but, you know,
I have 12 hours of the night to kill.

23:04.633 --> 23:05.805
And when I get tired of reading

23:05.885 --> 23:08.513
I do crossword puzzles,
but they're all too simple.

23:09.305 --> 23:10.648
Too simple?

23:12.308 --> 23:15.812
And then everybody I know is asleep,
and I'm awake at night.

23:15.978 --> 23:18.356
Is there something I could do?

23:18.480 --> 23:21.859
Hey!
Why don't we just go outside and box?

23:21.984 --> 23:25.204
I could split your lip again.
You'll feel a lot better.

23:25.321 --> 23:26.538
No.

23:28.616 --> 23:30.960
Hey, if you send a message,
would they get it'?

23:31.035 --> 23:34.005
- Yeah, sure.
- Send this.

23:34.622 --> 23:37.671
Send them,
"Don't over water the golds." Say that.

23:37.791 --> 23:40.465
- Okay, fine. The golds?
- Marigolds.

23:40.544 --> 23:41.636
- Oh, yeah.
- No, no, no.

23:41.712 --> 23:44.215
Say, "Don't over water
the marigolds Friday."

23:45.341 --> 23:49.391
"Don't over water
the marigolds on Friday

23:49.511 --> 23:50.512
Right.

23:51.221 --> 23:53.315
- "We'll be watching."
- Yeah, yeah. "We'll be watching."

23:53.390 --> 23:56.314
- How about that?
- Oh, my God. This is cool.

24:35.224 --> 24:40.230
It's okay, Attila, it's nothing. Static
electricity, that's ail. That's all it is.

24:42.940 --> 24:47.912
See, here, here you go. Okay.
All right, okay.

24:55.786 --> 25:00.917
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, man.

25:01.417 --> 25:04.762
Is somebody trying
to tell me something?

25:05.087 --> 25:06.259
Huh?

25:08.590 --> 25:09.967
What?

25:21.895 --> 25:24.068
- Did you pee in the cup?
- Yup.

25:24.148 --> 25:26.196
- You still having trouble sleeping?
- Yup.

25:26.275 --> 25:27.743
Any ideas?

25:29.737 --> 25:31.580
How long have you been feeling
this way?

25:31.655 --> 25:34.750
Well, you know how long I've been
feeling this way. Everybody does.

25:34.825 --> 25:37.453
I mean, it's been over a month
since my birthday.

25:38.454 --> 25:43.460
- Notice anything else or...
- Yeah.

25:45.127 --> 25:50.349
- What?
- Well, watch your fountain pen there.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.768
What do you mean?

25:55.804 --> 25:57.101
Ooh...

26:03.604 --> 26:05.982
- That's telekinesis.
- Yeah.

26:07.649 --> 26:12.871
- Is that okay?
- Do it again. Do it again.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.297
Well...

26:28.212 --> 26:33.013
You know, I consider myself
a rational man, a man of science.

26:33.133 --> 26:40.017
You know, open to whatever. But I feel
like a child, George. I feel scared.

26:40.891 --> 26:42.188
Me, too.

26:45.521 --> 26:49.151
Well, whatever the reason is,
I promise you we'll find it. Okay?

26:50.526 --> 26:54.201
Now, let me see you do that
one more time.

27:02.704 --> 27:05.253
- It's a monster, George.
- Yup, yup.

27:05.374 --> 27:09.720
This old Frankenstein here gets
90 miles to the gallon on methane.

27:09.837 --> 27:15.094
And that's made from my garbage
and Nate's pig manure. Special blend.

27:15.217 --> 27:16.594
Sure smells like it.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.396
See ya, Georgie.

27:25.561 --> 27:27.234
- Hello, Lace.
- Hey.

27:27.563 --> 27:28.735
These are a little bit different. I used

27:28.814 --> 27:30.987
- a little bit of a wider branch on these.
- Yeah, they look great.

27:32.442 --> 27:34.069
- George, are these yours?
- Yeah, yeah.

27:34.153 --> 27:37.953
I've been working on
some special organic fertilizers.

27:38.073 --> 27:41.998
Go ahead, taste it. No, no, no.
Bite into it like an apple.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.005
Oh.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.254
You got some on your chin. Sorry.

27:51.420 --> 27:54.549
Maybe the kids would like some.

27:54.631 --> 27:55.757
It's great. Thanks.

27:55.841 --> 27:58.594
No, no, no. Lace, wait.
Let me pick some out for you, okay?

27:58.677 --> 28:02.307
If the kids like them, you know,
you could make anything.

28:02.431 --> 28:05.651
You could make some sauce or a soup.

28:09.021 --> 28:12.651
- George, I thought you were smart.
- Hey, what's she got anyway?

28:12.774 --> 28:15.197
Yeah. Yeah,
besides uncomfortable chairs?

28:17.613 --> 28:21.334
My heart, amigos, my heart.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.737
Hey! George, wait.
Where do you think you're going?

28:55.984 --> 28:59.158
You guys going home?
You want a ride?

28:59.238 --> 29:00.831
- OKay_
- Glory!

29:00.906 --> 29:02.078
What?

29:02.157 --> 29:06.162
- Glory, come on.
- Would you come on?

29:06.328 --> 29:08.626
- All right.
- Al!

29:08.705 --> 29:10.833
- Okay, I'm coming.
- Hurry up!

29:12.584 --> 29:15.007
- Are you scared?
- Move over.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.735
- Are those for our mom?
- Yup.

29:31.270 --> 29:36.242
- I thought flowers were for dates.
- Don't get spooky, Al.

29:36.525 --> 29:38.243
Did she invite you?

29:40.904 --> 29:44.954
Hey, wait a minute. Blue.
I don't have blue.

29:55.544 --> 29:57.387
Oh, great.

30:08.181 --> 30:10.229
You guys know the name
of this flower?

30:10.350 --> 30:11.522
- No.
- No.

30:11.601 --> 30:15.572
<i>A Delphinium belladonna.
That's the Ranunculaceae family.</i>

30:16.356 --> 30:18.029
I didn't always know
about names of flowers.

30:18.108 --> 30:21.863
But it seems recently that I can
pretty much name any flower I see.

30:21.945 --> 30:23.322
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:23.405 --> 30:27.911
Like this one is Limonium sinuatum.
And this is the...

30:30.245 --> 30:33.089
Doesn't make them any prettier though.

30:34.249 --> 30:37.219
- Is that a garbage-bag tie?
- Yeah.

30:38.253 --> 30:40.472
I was improvising.

30:43.091 --> 30:46.595
- Hey, now that's a good idea.
- Yup.

30:55.437 --> 30:58.486
- That's much better.
- Yu p.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.572
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.298
My mom's around back!

31:20.504 --> 31:24.475
Lace? Hi.

31:26.343 --> 31:27.595
Hi.

31:27.677 --> 31:30.100
Now, you didn't nearly take
enough tomatoes.

31:30.180 --> 31:32.274
And I'm very proud of them.

31:33.016 --> 31:37.613
Well, there you go. And I got you these.

31:39.272 --> 31:42.492
Well, that's every wildflower
from my house to your house.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.403
Your kids helped.

31:44.486 --> 31:45.954
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

31:46.446 --> 31:50.542
- Hey, what are you working on?
- Nothing. Nothing.

31:50.784 --> 31:53.754
Look at this. Wow.
That's really great work.

31:53.829 --> 31:58.335
- Look at this. Beautiful.
- You want to walk?

31:59.292 --> 32:00.418
Sure.

32:01.795 --> 32:04.890
I gotta tell, you know,
you got great kids.

32:05.006 --> 32:06.804
Yeah, they are great kids.

32:06.883 --> 32:08.556
But you don't really know that yet,
George,

32:08.677 --> 32:11.772
because you don't know them
and you don't know me.

32:11.847 --> 32:14.475
- But I'm trying to get to know you.
- I know.

32:14.558 --> 32:18.813
I really want to keep my life
very simple, even predictable.

32:18.895 --> 32:20.363
That's why I moved here.

32:21.815 --> 32:25.991
I don't like surprises,
and I don't like complications.

32:26.862 --> 32:29.706
Well, what happened to you, Lace?

32:31.241 --> 32:33.084
I'm sorry. That's none of my business.

32:33.201 --> 32:34.794
- No, no, it's okay.
- I'm stupid.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.622
I'm so sorry.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.128
So let me ask you something, George.

32:39.207 --> 32:41.301
When a man comes over
with a basketful of tomatoes,

32:41.376 --> 32:43.549
what is he expecting? Dinner?

32:44.546 --> 32:47.174
No, no, no. Just hoping.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.644
<i>Trifolium. Look</i> at...

32:52.554 --> 32:55.558
You don't have any purple
in the flowers I got you, do you?

32:55.807 --> 32:57.059
Whoa...

32:57.684 --> 32:59.812
- Did you did you feel that?
- Feel what?

33:05.817 --> 33:08.821
- Come here. Come here, let's see.
- Okay.

33:09.404 --> 33:12.749
- Feel that right there.
- Feel what?

33:14.910 --> 33:18.756
- Oh, God. I think I know what this is.
- What?

33:19.080 --> 33:20.252
- Can I use your phone?
- Yeah.

33:20.582 --> 33:22.175
Yeah, thanks.

33:23.251 --> 33:24.594
Okay, yeah.

33:25.420 --> 33:28.344
Just east of Harmon. Do you know
which one I'm talking about?

33:29.090 --> 33:31.764
No, well, I was told to call you,
and I'm telling you right now

33:31.843 --> 33:34.266
that I picked up on some activity.

33:35.096 --> 33:36.939
No, we didn't use any instrumentation.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.944
No, I don't have a degree,
and I haven't studied anywhere.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.021
But I'm just trying to...
Are you shutting me down here?

33:43.104 --> 33:46.199
Is that what's going on?
Are you trying to shut me down?

33:46.274 --> 33:49.619
Look, I'm just trying to tell you that I felt
the compression waves, okay?

33:49.736 --> 33:52.706
ULF, ultra-low frequency waves.
Now, they have the ability to make

33:52.781 --> 33:54.954
you nauseous and dizzy. Am I right?

33:55.116 --> 33:57.869
Okay, well, that's what I felt,
and I'm trying to tell you

33:57.953 --> 33:58.954
that I think that there...

34:01.081 --> 34:03.129
There's an earthquake coming.

34:04.876 --> 34:05.968
Um...

34:06.044 --> 34:08.797
Listen, Al, why don't you put some
masking tape on the cupboards?

34:08.880 --> 34:11.632
And, Glory,
take the vases down and the china.

34:11.757 --> 34:13.226
Okay.

34:39.953 --> 34:44.800
This is good, Lace.
I think you're a good cook.

34:45.583 --> 34:52.592
No, I'm not. I only make two things
pretty well, pork chops and turkey.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.473
Which is this?

35:01.016 --> 35:02.188
I'm just...

35:16.114 --> 35:17.206
Look!

35:24.873 --> 35:29.845
- Al. I'm gonna kill you.
- I was just joking.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.674
You scared me.

35:37.594 --> 35:38.641
Not funny.

35:46.519 --> 35:48.487
Thanks.

35:56.029 --> 35:58.623
- All right, can I say it now?
- What's that?

35:59.824 --> 36:01.872
- You've got great kids.
- Thanks.

36:01.951 --> 36:03.703
- And I thank you for dinner.
- You're welcome.

36:04.287 --> 36:06.415
- And good night.
- Good night.

36:07.332 --> 36:08.584
- Good night.
- Okay.

36:12.587 --> 36:15.090
Shh! She's coming.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.676
- Tell her.
- No, you tell her.

36:22.097 --> 36:24.350
- He's neat.
- Yeah, he's nice, isn't he?

36:24.432 --> 36:26.025
Yeah, but he thinks he saw a UFO,

36:26.101 --> 36:27.978
and he thinks
he can predict earthquakes.

36:28.061 --> 36:29.938
There may be a warning here.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.240
But he never said for sure
it was a UFO.

36:32.315 --> 36:33.658
Yeah.

36:45.286 --> 36:47.004
Let's get in the truck. Get in the truck!

36:47.080 --> 36:48.627
- It's over, Mom.
- I know it's over! Let's go now!

37:02.637 --> 37:06.813
Did you feel it, huh?
Did you get scared?

37:06.933 --> 37:11.484
Do you realize the possibilities of this?
Do you know what this means?

37:19.779 --> 37:21.497
You felt it, didn't you?

37:23.116 --> 37:24.743
- You did.
- What is going on, George?

37:24.826 --> 37:27.750
- Wasn't that amazing?
- Tell me what's happening.

37:27.829 --> 37:30.173
I don't know. I don't.
I don't know what's happening.

37:30.290 --> 37:32.008
I need the simple truth, George.

37:32.500 --> 37:36.346
This is the truth.
What's happening to me is the truth.

37:49.017 --> 37:50.815
Oh, no.

37:56.816 --> 37:57.988
Lace.

38:07.202 --> 38:10.627
I love those chairs, Lace. I love them.

38:12.207 --> 38:15.882
You made them, okay? All right?

38:18.671 --> 38:20.548
I wanted to see you, okay? I mean...

38:20.632 --> 38:22.134
Bring them back
to your shop tomorrow.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.470
- I'll give you your money back.
- I don't want my money back, Lace.

38:24.552 --> 38:29.058
I just asked you for one thing, George.
The truth. And you couldn't handle it.

38:52.080 --> 38:55.175
- George, haven't you called her yet?
- Never mind about that, will you, Nate?

38:55.250 --> 38:56.923
Now this is the second one, gladiolus.
Remember that.

38:57.043 --> 38:58.761
How do you know
she's still mad at you?

38:58.878 --> 39:01.256
- I know. Now, all right...
- Write her a note.

39:01.381 --> 39:04.885
No, no, no. I found this.
Classic five-bed garden pattern. Here

39:05.009 --> 39:07.011
Flowers. You should send her flowers
or candies.

39:07.095 --> 39:09.518
Yeah. Marigolds, gladiolas,
roses, et cetera.

39:09.597 --> 39:13.272
And I went to the library
and I looked up the missile silo pattern

39:13.351 --> 39:17.857
at the Masterson Air Force Base,
and I made my own overlay.

39:17.939 --> 39:20.692
And here we go. There.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.118
- Yeah.
- See that?

39:22.193 --> 39:27.495
That's their garden. You see? Well,
that's old stuff, and it's declassified.

39:27.574 --> 39:29.121
But now this stuff is trickier.

39:29.200 --> 39:32.545
This is trigraphs
and tetragraphs and ABBA class.

39:32.620 --> 39:33.963
- George.
- Yep'?

39:34.038 --> 39:35.665
Why don't you just tell me
what you want me to send?

39:35.748 --> 39:38.922
All right. Okay, send this.
Why don't you send this?

39:39.002 --> 39:41.846
"Mind your garden. Frost coming.
Luck on the Mozop."

39:41.921 --> 39:43.673
You want to know what "Mozop" is?

39:43.756 --> 39:45.975
That's okay. It's your game, George.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.223
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, you sit in this chair yet?

39:48.303 --> 39:49.600
- It's nice.
- Yeah, yeah.

39:49.679 --> 39:51.181
You should give her a call right now.

39:51.264 --> 39:56.270
No, let her cool off.
I figure I'll give her about a year.

39:58.771 --> 40:00.694
Pick up the phone
and call her, George.

40:00.773 --> 40:03.822
Look who's talking.
Diana Ross fan club.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.621
Have you said 10 words
to a woman this year?

40:11.492 --> 40:15.872
- I'm sorry, Nate.
- Your transmission's finished, sir.

40:16.623 --> 40:19.843
I've just been going through
some things lately.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.886
Everybody's going through something.

40:21.961 --> 40:26.341
I know, but this thing's been
hard for me to handle.

40:27.842 --> 40:29.640
Let me show you something.

41:01.751 --> 41:07.554
- You suppose they magnetized you?
- I don't know, buddy. I wish I did.

41:16.224 --> 41:18.727
- What've we got here?
- Hurry up. Get in there, Doc.

41:18.810 --> 41:21.154
- Get right in.
- Doc, you better hurry.

41:23.606 --> 41:27.201
One of you go to the garbage and
bring me any food containers you find.

41:27.860 --> 41:32.787
Somebody else go in the cabinets
and look for damaged or swollen cans.

41:32.907 --> 41:35.330
- Food poisoning.
- I think.

41:35.410 --> 41:37.458
Now what the hell is he saying?
Who speaks Spanish?

41:37.537 --> 41:40.131
That's Portuguese.
They just came in last week.

41:40.206 --> 41:41.753
Portuguese?

41:43.668 --> 41:46.342
He's trying to tell us
something about Berto.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.840
That's the little one. It's a little boy.

41:48.923 --> 41:50.800
All right, some of you
search around here for the kid.

41:50.883 --> 41:53.386
I'm going to tell you that right now
he could be pretty darn sick.

41:53.469 --> 41:57.940
Now, Bonnie, wait. Get on the phone
and get George Malley over here.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.984
Tell him what's going on
and tell him to stop at the library

42:00.059 --> 42:02.027
for a English-Portuguese book.

42:02.103 --> 42:06.984
Tell him to find out how to ask
where a lost boy is. Got that?

42:07.066 --> 42:10.787
- George Malley?
- You bet. George.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.079
Go on, do it. Just go on, go on!

42:19.495 --> 42:22.214
- Don't you answer that?
- Not when I'm working.

42:23.458 --> 42:27.759
I've been farming all my life,
but this growth is amazing, George.

42:31.049 --> 42:32.346
This is embarrassing.

42:32.425 --> 42:35.304
You know I want to try this fertilizer
in your south 40.

42:35.386 --> 42:36.888
You just sprayed my boots.

42:37.472 --> 42:41.067
It's the worst soil in the county. I can't
even get weeds to grow in that field.

42:41.142 --> 42:43.065
But I bet we could get corn
to grow in that field.

42:43.144 --> 42:46.239
You bet?
You don't have any money to bet.

42:46.314 --> 42:48.783
You spent all your money on chairs,
remember?

43:03.247 --> 43:06.171
- George Malley?
- Yeah, I'm George Malley.

43:06.459 --> 43:10.305
I'm John Ringold.
We talked on the phone the other day.

43:10.379 --> 43:11.676
- John Ringold?
- Yes.

43:11.756 --> 43:12.928
- From Berkeley?
- Yes.

43:13.549 --> 43:15.517
- All right. Hi.
- Hi.

43:15.635 --> 43:18.104
- Hey, I'm glad you came by.
- Will your dog let me step out?

43:18.179 --> 43:21.774
Yeah, yeah. Well,
he just has a thing for seismologists.

43:21.849 --> 43:23.943
- So come on out.
- Thank you.

43:24.018 --> 43:25.770
Yeah, this is my friend, Nate Pope.

43:25.853 --> 43:27.446
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

43:27.522 --> 43:28.990
- Okay.
- Well, let me get you a cold drink.

43:29.065 --> 43:30.362
- Come on in.
- From the university?

43:30.441 --> 43:31.533
Yes.

43:31.609 --> 43:34.362
And we are very interested
in how you were able to

43:34.445 --> 43:36.573
predict that earthquake, Mr. Malley.

43:36.656 --> 43:38.078
Oh, that.

43:38.991 --> 43:42.086
You see, I just picked up
the subsonic frequency waves, right?

43:42.161 --> 43:44.710
And course, I was standing on the fault
so that made it easier.

43:44.831 --> 43:47.209
And what instrumentation did you use?

43:47.458 --> 43:50.132
- Just me.
- If you think that's something,

43:50.211 --> 43:51.588
you should see him move stuff
with his brain.

43:51.671 --> 43:56.177
Nate, never mind that. You see,
I felt the ultra-low frequency waves.

43:56.259 --> 43:58.557
And they kind of made me dizzy
and nauseous, right?

43:58.636 --> 43:59.979
And that's how I perceived all this.

44:00.054 --> 44:04.184
We've been studying quake prediction
for 10 years.

44:04.308 --> 44:08.529
There's no record of any person
ever feeling the pre-quake activity.

44:08.604 --> 44:10.197
Now there is.

44:12.316 --> 44:15.536
We have some ULF equipment
in our labs.

44:15.778 --> 44:17.872
Could you come in for an experiment?

44:17.947 --> 44:19.369
- Come to Berkeley?
- Yes.

44:19.949 --> 44:20.996
Yes.

44:22.243 --> 44:25.372
Well, my department would like to
interview you and clear this up.

44:25.454 --> 44:28.378
I would be so glad to come to Berkeley.

44:28.457 --> 44:31.927
Do you think that I could meet
with some other departments, as well?

44:32.003 --> 44:35.678
I have some experiments that
I'd like to show you. Come with me

44:36.132 --> 44:37.258
They're nice.

44:40.261 --> 44:42.684
All right, well, let's see.

44:42.763 --> 44:43.935
Um...

44:44.307 --> 44:47.902
Yes, here. Okay.
Now look, I've taken solar panels,

44:47.977 --> 44:51.777
and I've actually germinated the seeds
that made these plants grow.

44:51.856 --> 44:54.109
And trying to change
the electromagnetic field, right?

44:54.192 --> 44:56.786
- Mr. Malley?
- I took incandescent light...

44:56.861 --> 44:58.534
- Mr. Malley.
- ...and I turned it into sunlight,

44:58.613 --> 45:00.286
which actually made these plants grow.

45:00.364 --> 45:04.665
- Mr. Malley.
- Now, look, I took pig manure,

45:04.744 --> 45:08.374
and I turned it into a fuel which I
believe will actually run an automobile.

45:08.456 --> 45:11.130
All I'm interested in is the earthquake.

45:11.209 --> 45:15.510
We need to know if that was a fluke,
a coincidence.

45:16.547 --> 45:18.049
A fluke?

45:19.175 --> 45:22.520
George, why don't you
move something with your mind?

45:23.971 --> 45:26.815
Maybe move his...
Or something like that.

45:26.891 --> 45:29.861
- Look, Mr. Ringold...
- Doctor.

45:29.936 --> 45:35.284
Dr. Ringold, look,
I've got my garden out there

45:35.358 --> 45:36.780
and that acts like a lab, right?

45:36.859 --> 45:38.452
And I've got everything
that you see here,

45:38.527 --> 45:40.780
but I really need to talk
to people like you, okay?

45:40.863 --> 45:43.958
Hey, George!
Hey, George, you home?

45:44.033 --> 45:46.331
Please don't go, okay?
Please, just please don't go.

45:47.662 --> 45:49.414
Hey, George!

45:50.289 --> 45:52.667
George,
Doc says you better come right now!

45:52.750 --> 45:55.970
- What's the matter?
- Come on, man, it's an emergency!

45:56.045 --> 45:58.298
You gotta learn how to talk
Portuguese on the way over there.

45:58.381 --> 46:04.184
- I gotta go.
- Portuguese? Learn Portuguese?

46:05.596 --> 46:07.724
Why don't you go along, Professor?

46:25.783 --> 46:29.162
George, Doc's inside.
He thinks it's food poisoning.

46:29.245 --> 46:30.588
Hey, George.

46:32.290 --> 46:35.009
- Doc, George is here.
- He's gonna be fine, George.

46:35.084 --> 46:37.553
But his grandson is missing.
Now, if they ate the same thing,

46:37.628 --> 46:39.050
the boy could be a lot worse off.

46:39.547 --> 46:40.890
- You brought the book?
- Yeah, I have it.

46:40.965 --> 46:43.343
All right, okay.
Ask him where the boy is.

46:48.431 --> 46:50.684
"The orchard."
He said he's in the orchard.

46:50.766 --> 46:52.439
Right, yeah, okay.

47:00.693 --> 47:04.118
He said that they ate something bad
and he thinks the boy is sick.

47:22.423 --> 47:25.393
Tito drove the truck
while I read the book.

47:25.468 --> 47:29.848
George Malley, you learned the
Portuguese language in 20 minutes?

47:30.264 --> 47:31.811
Not all of it.

47:33.184 --> 47:35.903
- What are you looking for here, a kid?
- What's the kid's name?

47:36.103 --> 47:40.108
- It's Alberto. Berto, Alberto, yeah.
- Alberto? Alberto.

47:41.150 --> 47:45.576
Let's spread out and comb these trees.
Everybody, let's go. Okay.

47:45.654 --> 47:47.327
- Look real careful.
- Alberto!

47:47.406 --> 47:50.034
- Call out his name.
- Alberto!

47:50.326 --> 47:55.958
- Alberto!
- Alberto!

47:56.040 --> 47:57.417
Berto!

48:00.544 --> 48:02.797
- Where are you, kid?
- Alberto!

48:03.172 --> 48:04.765
Where are you, fella'? We're coming.

48:05.257 --> 48:07.680
- Alberto!
- Alberto!

48:52.263 --> 48:53.981
George, what you got?

48:55.474 --> 48:56.646
What?

48:57.268 --> 48:59.145
- He's not in the orchard.
- No?

48:59.228 --> 49:00.696
He's sick, Doc.

49:04.024 --> 49:06.118
- He's there. There.
- Where is he, George?

49:06.193 --> 49:08.321
- Where?
- Over here.

49:08.404 --> 49:10.031
Okay, that's good.

49:12.324 --> 49:14.702
We're with you. We're with you.

49:16.203 --> 49:18.205
What's going on?

49:31.385 --> 49:34.764
- You okay, George?
- It's not me. It's him.

49:36.140 --> 49:41.488
- Tell me where he is.
- I don't know. I don't know.

50:02.750 --> 50:07.221
Look! There's a ladder under there!
Come on.

50:19.141 --> 50:20.267
He was right!

50:21.519 --> 50:22.896
He's up here!

50:23.896 --> 50:26.615
Doc, you better get up here fast.

50:27.233 --> 50:29.281
Good work, George.

50:42.081 --> 50:44.630
So is Wednesday good for you?
Say, 2:00'?

50:44.708 --> 50:46.710
- Sure, Wednesday is good.
- Should I send a car?

50:46.794 --> 50:48.592
No, John, I'll get there on my own.

50:48.671 --> 50:51.220
And I'll have somebody
from Solar Energy there.

50:51.298 --> 50:55.769
- And anything else?
- Yeah, Automotive.

50:55.970 --> 50:58.143
Hey, do you have
an agricultural school at Berkeley?

50:58.222 --> 50:59.269
Yeah.

50:59.348 --> 51:03.319
- Well, how about for my fertilizer?
- I'll take care of it.

51:09.733 --> 51:11.201
Hey, George.

51:16.073 --> 51:17.666
That's the little boy's mom.

51:18.492 --> 51:21.041
She's the only one
who talks English, I think.

51:21.161 --> 51:23.289
It's too bad she wasn't
here earlier, huh?

51:23.372 --> 51:27.343
Yeah. But I guess she had to
look for work, man.

51:29.295 --> 51:31.389
I want you to meet a very special guy.

51:31.463 --> 51:35.218
This is the man who found your son,
okay? Very special.

51:35.301 --> 51:38.305
This is George Malley. This is Ella.

51:39.513 --> 51:41.186
Hello.

51:45.936 --> 51:48.314
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

51:48.480 --> 51:49.606
Thank you.

51:52.610 --> 51:56.080
I'll take you to the hospital, okay?
Thanks, George.

51:59.783 --> 52:01.126
Way to go, patrén.

52:01.201 --> 52:03.829
Do you know what kind of work
she was looking for?

52:03.912 --> 52:06.335
Cook, I think they say. Housekeeper.

52:07.708 --> 52:09.836
You know somebody who's looking?

52:12.504 --> 52:15.007
- All right, Nate.
- Thanks, George.

52:15.090 --> 52:17.809
I found a housekeeper for you,
a Portuguese woman.

52:17.885 --> 52:20.559
She cooks, too.
I think she's perfect for you.

52:20.638 --> 52:22.390
I don't know if I could eat
Portuguese food, George.

52:22.473 --> 52:24.646
Well, she'll cook you anything
you want, Nate.

52:24.725 --> 52:28.229
And she'll try to make sense of that
so-called house that you live in.

52:28.312 --> 52:31.236
- She speak English?
- Well, a bit but...

52:31.315 --> 52:33.443
That's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna work on your Portuguese.

52:33.525 --> 52:35.072
- Me?
- Yeah.

52:35.152 --> 52:37.246
- You got a problem with that?
- No, no.

52:38.072 --> 52:39.449
I don't know
if that's gonna work, George.

52:39.531 --> 52:42.626
All right, well, let's try it.
What do you want to say?

52:44.036 --> 52:48.507
How about something like,
"Can you come twice a week?"

52:49.166 --> 52:51.339
- Okay. "Can you come twice a week?"
- Okay.

52:51.418 --> 52:53.841
"Can you come twice a week?"

52:59.968 --> 53:03.689
- That sounds complicated, George.
- No, no, you got your tape recorder

53:03.764 --> 53:08.816
and you learn it phonetically.
No problem. What else?

53:08.894 --> 53:10.066
Uh...

53:10.479 --> 53:13.278
- "How much per day?"
- "How much per..." Okay, good.

53:13.357 --> 53:14.483
"How much per day?"

53:19.154 --> 53:20.326
- I like that one.
- Yeah, yeah.

53:20.447 --> 53:21.448
- That one's nice. Okay.
- What else?

53:21.532 --> 53:26.333
Okay. "Can you start next week?"

53:26.453 --> 53:28.455
Perfect. Logical, right'? Okay.

53:28.539 --> 53:30.962
- Yeah, yeah.
- "Can you start next week?"

53:34.670 --> 53:36.638
- Beautiful language, huh?
- That's it?

53:36.714 --> 53:39.308
Yep. Work on those.

53:40.300 --> 53:43.554
You know, George,
I might be pretty good at Portuguese.

53:56.817 --> 54:01.698
No, oh... Never mind.
We'll get used to them.

54:02.364 --> 54:04.992
If you leave them alone
they'll leave you alone.

54:05.075 --> 54:08.170
It's a good arrangement.
What are we reading?

54:08.245 --> 54:12.250
- This.
- What is this? Where did you get this?

54:12.332 --> 54:13.584
From me.

54:13.667 --> 54:16.591
This is not a good choice for bedtime.

54:17.171 --> 54:19.924
- Are you still mad at him?
- What's the difference?

54:20.007 --> 54:24.854
He's neat, and they say he saved
that boy's life at the orchard.

54:25.512 --> 54:26.638
He's funny.

54:26.722 --> 54:29.771
We are funny enough.
We laugh all the time.

54:32.895 --> 54:36.115
Look, we're reading Black Beauty,
and we are not talking about men.

54:36.190 --> 54:38.693
I've got enough to worry about.
Too much.

54:39.902 --> 54:42.872
- What?
- Well, you guys for one.

54:42.946 --> 54:44.619
We're not little any more.

54:44.698 --> 54:46.575
I know you're not little
any more, sweetie.

54:46.700 --> 54:50.705
But you think that George Malley is
safe and you're afraid of coyotes.

54:50.788 --> 54:53.962
You've got it all backwards. Here.
Find our place.

54:55.042 --> 54:57.340
Go brush your teeth. I'll be right back.

54:57.419 --> 54:59.638
- Don't you have a report to do?
- Did it.

55:03.050 --> 55:06.350
"They're everywhere."
Al, do you really believe this?

55:06.428 --> 55:09.898
Yeah. There's been
a lot of UFO people coming into town

55:09.973 --> 55:13.568
since George saw what he saw.

55:13.936 --> 55:15.529
The word's spreading, Ma.

55:15.604 --> 55:17.277
You just believe
what you want to believe.

55:17.397 --> 55:19.900
Most people do. You get over it.

55:23.445 --> 55:25.743
Hey, I thought
we were getting ready for bed

55:25.823 --> 55:26.915
No.

55:30.661 --> 55:33.130
Can we stop talking about him,
all right?

55:33.247 --> 55:36.751
- Why do you hate him?
- Because I like him.

55:37.751 --> 55:38.923
Told you.

55:40.587 --> 55:44.592
But if he was sitting here with us right
now, wouldn't you be watching him'?

55:45.133 --> 55:49.434
Wondering what's he thinking?
When's he gonna leave?

55:50.138 --> 55:51.685
Is he gonna leave?

55:52.599 --> 55:53.771
Hmm?

55:54.810 --> 55:56.938
We don't need that.

56:00.482 --> 56:02.359
It's okay. Shh!

56:02.442 --> 56:05.616
- He found the kid and left the...
- I heard he took 20 minutes.

56:05.696 --> 56:08.666
Twenty minutes, he read the whole
damn book, knew Portuguese.

56:08.782 --> 56:11.205
- You were there. He was, too!
- And then he went running around...

56:11.285 --> 56:14.539
Hey, here he comes, here he comes.

56:15.998 --> 56:17.545
- Hey, George.
- Hello.

56:17.624 --> 56:19.297
- Hi.
- Hi.

56:21.670 --> 56:25.846
So, George, how'd you feel
that earthquake coming?

56:25.924 --> 56:29.679
- Voices tell you?
- Voices? Hell, no.

56:30.137 --> 56:31.855
What else do you know, George?

56:32.806 --> 56:35.400
Well, I know you're on the outs
with Lisa again.

56:35.601 --> 56:36.898
How did you know that?

56:36.977 --> 56:40.026
'Cause when she's living with you
she makes sure your clothes match.

56:40.105 --> 56:41.152
Poor Banes.

56:41.982 --> 56:43.950
Do you get messages, George?

56:44.026 --> 56:46.620
Yeah, well, yeah,
when Paulette delivers the mail, I do.

56:46.695 --> 56:48.914
But today she was two hours late.

56:48.989 --> 56:52.334
I think we ought to do something
about that. Complain or something.

56:53.327 --> 56:55.045
Earthquake, earthquake. Can we...

56:55.120 --> 56:56.747
Well, Jimmy, it was...

56:56.830 --> 56:59.253
I was out by Ash Creek,
and I felt some vibrations, that's all.

56:59.333 --> 57:01.176
How'd you know where to find the boy
in that orchard?

57:01.251 --> 57:03.049
Well, I don't know, Bonnie.
I mean, come on.

57:03.128 --> 57:06.428
- Do you know what's going to happen?
- Roger, come on!

57:06.506 --> 57:07.553
I'm sorry, I'm...

57:07.633 --> 57:10.227
They say at the library
you read four books a day now.

57:10.302 --> 57:12.896
Yeah, well, that was last week, and...

57:17.100 --> 57:19.228
I better go.

57:19.436 --> 57:21.404
How many languages
do you speak now?

57:23.190 --> 57:24.362
Huh?

57:24.816 --> 57:27.285
If anything bad was gonna happen,
you'd tell us.

57:28.320 --> 57:31.415
Won't you? Hey!

57:37.955 --> 57:39.707
- Okay, I'll be there, all right.
- All right.

57:42.960 --> 57:44.883
Okay. Thanks.

57:49.716 --> 57:51.434
- Hi, Lace.
- Hello.

57:57.599 --> 58:00.569
I'm sorry I lied to you about the chairs.

58:02.562 --> 58:06.863
I just wanted you to come to my shop,
so you would talk to me,

58:08.610 --> 58:10.453
instead of...

58:10.570 --> 58:12.618
Instead of always
walking away from me.

58:12.739 --> 58:14.867
What do you want, George?

58:17.369 --> 58:18.962
I want you to come to Berkeley with me.

58:19.079 --> 58:23.129
I've been invited to talk to some
scientists about the earthquake thing

58:23.250 --> 58:25.252
and about some of my experiments.

58:25.419 --> 58:28.593
You know, the fertilizer
and the solar panels and...

58:28.714 --> 58:31.718
- That's really nice.
- I'm excited, but I...

58:33.051 --> 58:35.895
I guess I'm scared, too.

58:35.971 --> 58:39.350
- I sure would like you there with me.
- What for?

58:39.433 --> 58:44.530
Support. Confidence. A friend.

58:44.604 --> 58:48.325
You've got friends. You know everyone
in the whole area code.

58:48.442 --> 58:51.286
I don't know, you know,
since that orchard thing, it...

58:51.403 --> 58:54.532
People are different now.
They're... I don't like it.

58:54.614 --> 58:55.991
You know, the funny thing is,

58:56.116 --> 59:00.246
is that you're probably the only one
that's mad at me for a good reason.

59:05.417 --> 59:07.670
You're just trying to make up

59:08.295 --> 59:12.300
Yes. I'm trying to make up with you.
I am trying to get a date with you.

59:12.424 --> 59:14.472
And I would love it if you stood by me

59:14.593 --> 59:17.722
while all those scientists
and teachers ask me questions.

59:17.804 --> 59:20.933
You know,
I spent half of school in detention.

59:23.518 --> 59:24.986
When?

59:25.187 --> 59:27.155
- Wednesday.
- What time?

59:28.315 --> 59:29.988
Leave about noon.

59:30.108 --> 59:33.954
I'll be outside your shop at noon,
if I'm coming.

59:34.029 --> 59:36.532
And if I'm not there...

59:36.656 --> 59:37.828
Okay.

59:38.950 --> 59:40.497
Thanks, Lace.

01:00:04.392 --> 01:00:05.644
Uh...

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:07.354
One second.

01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:09.652
One second. Here I come.

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.748
You are Mr. Pope?

01:00:20.075 --> 01:00:21.918
You are Mr. Pope?

01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:27.667
I am Michaela. Ella.

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:31.215
- You're Ella?
- Yes.

01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:36.057
Wow. I'm sorry. Please.

01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:39.057
Um... Maybe you need to...

01:00:39.553 --> 01:00:44.150
Yes, this is the place. I cook, too.
You need cooking?

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:46.147
Cooking. Yeah.

01:00:46.226 --> 01:00:48.820
Good. Fine. Good.

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:50.317
How much you pay?

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:51.569
Uh...

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:54.151
Wait.

01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:55.573
Um...

01:00:56.695 --> 01:00:58.663
I speak a little Portuguese.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:10.925
I don't know what you just said,
but it sounded great.

01:01:12.419 --> 01:01:13.671
Sorry.

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:18.850
Okay, tomorrow I come back.
9:00, okay?

01:01:18.925 --> 01:01:21.428
I work, and we talk about money.

01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:24.018
No, wait.

01:01:30.604 --> 01:01:32.356
That's all I really know.

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:33.941
That, and, um...

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:45.043
Is that right?

01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:48.580
You're cute.

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:54.260
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

01:01:55.962 --> 01:01:57.589
Tomorrow, then.

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:09.313
CQ, CQ?

01:02:11.311 --> 01:02:13.313
This is WB-6, QLF.

01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:19.783
Diana, if you can hear me,
I know you'll understand this.

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:27.920
I just met an angel from Portugal,

01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:33.251
here in my house.

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.458
You George Malley?

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:13.211
Jack Hatch, FBI.

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:17.802
Nate Pope sent a coded message
to Masterson Air Force Base.

01:03:17.877 --> 01:03:21.632
No, no, no, Nate Pope did not send a
coded message to the Air Force base.

01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:22.807
I did.

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:25.055
Well, who taught you the cipher,
Mr. Malley?

01:03:25.176 --> 01:03:27.975
Nobody. I just broke the code.

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:29.727
Who trained you?

01:03:29.848 --> 01:03:34.069
As I said, nobody. I... Man.

01:03:35.228 --> 01:03:36.571
Mmm-hmm.

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:51.081
Well?

01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:01.839
- Can't do it.
- You can do it, Mr. Malley.

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:04.341
Too complex.

01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:11.894
We're releasing Nathan Pope.

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:16.353
It's about time. Can I talk to him?

01:04:16.436 --> 01:04:17.562
No.

01:04:20.106 --> 01:04:21.608
Try this one.

01:04:22.233 --> 01:04:25.533
You know, it was just a game, okay?
I mean, a game.

01:04:25.612 --> 01:04:28.536
You caused the cancellation
of a top-secret training exercise,

01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:32.119
Mr. Malley, the scrapping
of an entire cipher system.

01:04:32.243 --> 01:04:35.042
You cost the government
a lot of money.

01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:37.291
So, bill me.

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:54.232
I think he's what he says he is, a fluke.

01:04:54.307 --> 01:04:57.402
He's an independent,
playing some kind of genius games.

01:04:57.477 --> 01:04:59.275
I want him tested.

01:05:00.146 --> 01:05:04.151
- Can't keep holding him.
- Yes, we can. He resisted arrest.

01:05:04.275 --> 01:05:06.653
- No, he didn't.
- Yes, he did.

01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:10.285
Test him.

01:05:10.824 --> 01:05:16.456
All right, I'll start the questions
and I'll be timing your responses.

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:21.092
And we'll be recording. Any questions?

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:25.013
- What's your first name?
- My first name is Bob.

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:29.927
- Hi.
- Shoot, Bob.

01:05:30.009 --> 01:05:31.181
Right.

01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:35.432
Name as many mammals
<i>as</i> you can in 60 seconds.

01:05:35.515 --> 01:05:37.517
Ready? Go.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.025
Hmm. Sixty seconds.
Well, how would you like that?

01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:42.943
How about alphabetical?

01:05:43.022 --> 01:05:45.696
Aardvark, baboon, caribou,
dolphin, eohippus, fox, gorilla,

01:05:45.817 --> 01:05:49.867
hyena, ibex, jackal, kangaroo, lion,
marmoset, Newfoundland, ocelot,

01:05:49.988 --> 01:05:54.368
panda, rat, sloth, tiger, unicorn,
varmint, whale, yak, zebra.

01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:56.870
Now, varmint is a stretch.
So is Newfoundland.

01:05:56.995 --> 01:05:58.963
That's a dog breed.

01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:01.132
Unicorn is mythical.
Eohippus is prehistoric.

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:04.882
But you weren't being very specific
now, were you, Bob?

01:06:09.507 --> 01:06:12.226
Well, I'll...

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:16.560
I'll try to be more specific.

01:06:16.681 --> 01:06:18.979
- You ready for the next one?
- Shoot.

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:24.064
Answer <i>as</i> quickly as you can.
How old is a person born in 1928?

01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:26.066
Man or woman?

01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:31.245
- Why?
- Specifics, Bob.

01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:33.198
Okay, one more time.

01:06:34.365 --> 01:06:37.414
How old is a man born in 1928?

01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:38.996
Still alive?

01:06:43.249 --> 01:06:49.848
If a man is born in 1928,
and he's still alive, how old is he?

01:06:49.923 --> 01:06:51.391
What month?

01:06:52.926 --> 01:06:58.183
If a man was born October 3rd, 1928,

01:06:58.264 --> 01:07:00.437
and he's still alive, how old is he?

01:07:00.558 --> 01:07:04.938
- What time?
- 10:00 p.m.

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:07.023
- Where?
- Anywhere.

01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:09.859
Well, let's get specific, Bob.
I mean, if the guy's still alive,

01:07:09.943 --> 01:07:13.197
born in California,
October 3rd, 1928, 10:00 p.m.,

01:07:13.279 --> 01:07:18.957
<i>he's 67 years, 9 months,
22 days, 14 hours and 12 minutes.</i>

01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:23.131
If he's born in New York,
he's three hours older, now, isn't he?

01:07:39.097 --> 01:07:40.940
How do you do that?

01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:46.108
How do you make that pencil move?

01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:48.907
Is that a trick pencil?

01:07:49.274 --> 01:07:52.323
No. I ask it to move.

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:57.659
I mean, I could say that I will it, but
that would be more like a command.

01:07:57.782 --> 01:08:01.662
This is more like a collaboration,
a partnership.

01:08:02.328 --> 01:08:03.830
- Partnership?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:06.416
With a pencil?

01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:10.504
Well, why not? We're all made up
of the same stuff, aren't we?

01:08:12.505 --> 01:08:15.258
- Wood?
- Energy, Bob.

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:19.767
- You know, the little pieces.
- Right, yeah.

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:23.270
I want to go home.
How the hell can I get home, Bob?

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:33.484
I don't know. Sorry.

01:08:48.832 --> 01:08:50.005
Hey.

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:54.514
They say you haven't slept.

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:59.974
Who's that? My keepers? I'm all right.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:03.140
You know, you're a pretty gifted man,
Mr. Malley.

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:06.984
No, no, really.

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:10.154
We were hoping...
Well, I was kind of hoping

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:13.654
that you might find
something that you enjoy doing,

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:16.327
something useful in our world.

01:09:16.402 --> 01:09:19.029
- Your world?
- Intelligence.

01:09:19.863 --> 01:09:22.162
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:26.337
It's home for me, Jack.
I'm jumping out of my skin here.

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:29.916
I mean, I want my life. I want my life.

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:35.337
What do you want?

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:38.095
- It's not what I want.
- What do they want?

01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:44.435
They want to feel safe.
They don't feel safe with you out there.

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:46.107
Well, why would they?

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:50.358
They're having me break codes all
night, secret codes. I mean, they're...

01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:53.439
I shouldn't be listening to a code
from Britain to Saudi Arabia.

01:09:53.564 --> 01:09:55.111
I mean, these are our allies.

01:09:55.233 --> 01:09:58.863
If you guys are gonna accuse me
of a crime or keep me here,

01:09:58.945 --> 01:10:00.697
I'll tell the press.

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:03.203
Or I'll call London or Riyadh.

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:08.626
I know all the capitals now, by the way.
You can test me.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:14.465
My interest in Mr. Malley has to do
with seismology and geology.

01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:17.805
It has nothing to do
with security issues.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.473
I know, but that's not the point.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:21.551
Mr. Malley has been
released without charges,

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:23.807
but he is considered a security risk.

01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:27.899
Look, I'll be frank with you.
He's an unknown quantity.

01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:30.568
We'd feel better, for the time being,

01:10:30.643 --> 01:10:32.896
if he wasn't granted any access
to the institutions

01:10:32.979 --> 01:10:35.573
where sensitive government projects
are in the works.

01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:37.150
Access?

01:10:37.275 --> 01:10:39.323
Access even to personnel.

01:10:43.489 --> 01:10:46.459
Lace, it's me.

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:57.845
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:10:57.962 --> 01:11:00.181
I'm sorry I didn't come
through the front door,

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:01.599
but I was so afraid I'd wake the kids.

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:03.927
That's okay, that's okay.

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:07.184
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I wanted to see you.

01:11:08.347 --> 01:11:10.691
Nate told me about the FBI.

01:11:10.767 --> 01:11:12.189
I'm so glad they let you go.

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:13.611
Yeah, well, they had no choice.

01:11:13.686 --> 01:11:16.690
But they are watching me so closely.

01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:19.279
I think I scare them.

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:24.280
You scare me, too.

01:11:25.823 --> 01:11:27.040
I do?

01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:29.831
Hmm...

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:38.633
Listen, George,
it's getting really complicated. I just...

01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:41.715
I just don't know
what's gonna happen next.

01:11:46.052 --> 01:11:49.226
I should probably leave you alone,
shouldn't I?

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:55.528
I guess so.

01:12:04.904 --> 01:12:08.408
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

01:12:24.715 --> 01:12:25.887
Hey.

01:12:26.551 --> 01:12:28.895
- You want a beer, George?
- Yep.

01:12:30.555 --> 01:12:35.857
Look, Nate, I am really sorry
for what happened, okay?

01:12:37.228 --> 01:12:39.606
I told them everything, George.

01:12:40.398 --> 01:12:44.244
I told them everything about you,
everything.

01:12:44.944 --> 01:12:48.369
Well, you know, that's supposed to
happen, okay? I mean, you know, it's...

01:12:48.447 --> 01:12:52.623
You just think you're not gonna be
so scared, and you're sitting there,

01:12:52.743 --> 01:12:54.211
you don't know what's gonna happen,

01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:57.962
and then all of a sudden
something happens inside you, right?

01:12:58.082 --> 01:13:00.050
And you don't know what it is but...

01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:03.050
It's all right.
It was my game, you know?

01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:12.063
What'd they do to you, George?

01:13:13.097 --> 01:13:14.724
They tested me.

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:18.148
What did they find Out?

01:13:20.313 --> 01:13:21.906
I'm pregnant.

01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:25.151
- That's how it feels.
- How what feels?

01:13:25.276 --> 01:13:28.576
Yeah, you know, to be full of ideas
and you can't deliver, okay?

01:13:28.654 --> 01:13:31.407
I mean, you know, you're ready
to break out, and you can't deliver.

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:33.242
You know, this professor,
he won't even talk to me.

01:13:33.326 --> 01:13:35.454
He won't even talk to me.

01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:37.087
You're not going to Berkeley, George?

01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:40.417
Come on, me at Berkeley.
That's a thought, huh?

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:43.093
I'm sorry, buddy.

01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:44.762
You mean inventions?
You got inventions?

01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:47.260
No, no, ideas, okay?
I got 1,000 ideas a day,

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:49.263
every damn minute. Okay?

01:13:49.342 --> 01:13:53.597
I got big "holy cow" kind of ideas
and little "what if' ideas, all right?

01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:56.353
Hey, I got ideas for you, Jimmy.
Look at this. Look at this.

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:58.184
Your parking lot,
it's laid out all wrong, okay?

01:13:58.309 --> 01:14:01.279
Now, if you just follow this, right,
you can put six more cars in,

01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:03.106
and nobody gets fender benders,
all right?

01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:05.191
Where's Paulette? Where is she?

01:14:05.316 --> 01:14:07.865
Bonnie. Here, take this.
This is a new route for her mail, okay?

01:14:07.944 --> 01:14:09.946
Now, if she does this,
she can save an hour a day

01:14:10.029 --> 01:14:12.623
and everybody gets their mail by 3:00.
Imagine, 3:00.

01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:15.042
And I got a "holy shit" idea, too.
Look at this.

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:19.042
Now this may be the most efficient way
to store solar energy, okay? Take it.

01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:20.210
Well, what am I going to do with it?

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:22.508
What the hell am I supposed
to do with it, huh?

01:14:22.667 --> 01:14:24.715
You know what that light was?
You know what that sound was?

01:14:24.835 --> 01:14:26.303
- Tell us.
- I'm gonna tell you what it was.

01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:28.222
- Well, tell us.
- It was a damn alien.

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:29.549
Don't say that.
You don't know what it was.

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:31.305
- I know what it is, Nate.
- You don't know what it was.

01:14:31.384 --> 01:14:32.556
- Don't say that!
- Well, tell us!

01:14:32.677 --> 01:14:34.645
It's a goddamn mistake, is what it is!

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.893
Okay? It was supposed to happen
to someone smart,

01:14:37.014 --> 01:14:39.813
someone that's scientific,
someone who's a leader.

01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:42.395
But it didn't. It happened to me
George freaking Malley!

01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:43.821
Look at him! Now, look at him! Look!

01:14:51.529 --> 01:14:52.746
Jimmy?

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:56.701
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:14:58.411 --> 01:15:00.914
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it's all right.

01:15:01.038 --> 01:15:03.587
- I'll pay for it.
- All right.

01:15:05.084 --> 01:15:08.759
Bonnie, Bonnie, please, it's okay.

01:15:10.715 --> 01:15:12.058
Oh, man.

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:26.197
Mmm-hmm.

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:28.866
Okay.

01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:31.069
Who was that? A customer?

01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:36.366
It's Banes.
Says he can't work here no more.

01:15:36.449 --> 01:15:37.621
Sorry.

01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:41.121
Well, why didn't he talk to me?

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:42.295
Little bit scared, I guess.

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:46.126
- Jesus Christ.
- Look, George, it'll wear off.

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:49.052
They'll forget.
Their cars are gonna break down...

01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:50.300
Hi.

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:51.972
- Hey, Doc.
- Hi.

01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:57.557
- Energy vibrations? What is it?
- I don't know.

01:15:57.636 --> 01:15:59.309
Telekinesis? What? What?

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:01.857
- Yeah, maybe, maybe, yeah.
- You think it's getting out of hand?

01:16:01.974 --> 01:16:03.692
Well, look, you know,
I was mad, all right'?

01:16:03.809 --> 01:16:05.903
I was pissed off.
And I'm not mad now, okay?

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:10.324
Good. I'll sound the all clear,
call off the paratroopers.

01:16:10.483 --> 01:16:14.158
Jesus, George.
Now, listen, you owe me a CAT scan.

01:16:14.278 --> 01:16:16.246
- I want more blood.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:16:16.322 --> 01:16:18.950
Also, you look like hell.

01:16:19.033 --> 01:16:21.832
That's good.
Doc, what's the matter with everybody?

01:16:21.952 --> 01:16:24.205
They won't give me a chance
to explain anything. I look at...

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:27.800
I look at them, and they look at me
like I'm a green bug or something.

01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:30.128
- Give them some time, George.
- Now, look, I have an idea.

01:16:30.211 --> 01:16:33.556
Now, you look at this. Now, look at this.
Look at that.

01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:35.766
I'm a big deal at the Harmon Library.

01:16:35.841 --> 01:16:37.684
I can take up to 30 books
a night, okay'?

01:16:37.802 --> 01:16:40.646
And I told them I'd be part of this.
I said that I'd put out a table...

01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:41.893
- Pressure's way up now.
- ...and I'd sit there,

01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:44.563
and people could ask me questions.
You know, meet George Malley.

01:16:44.683 --> 01:16:46.811
- What do you think?
- Like a circus attraction.

01:16:46.894 --> 01:16:49.443
- Oh, God, Doc, please?
- Yeah.

01:16:49.522 --> 01:16:52.901
You know, see,
I could explain to them once and for all.

01:16:53.025 --> 01:16:54.618
I could share my ideas with them.

01:16:54.693 --> 01:16:56.912
You know, and then I could get
my life back together.

01:16:57.029 --> 01:17:00.374
Come see me for that scan.
Take it easy on sugar and salt. Okay?

01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:04.792
And do like I told you all your life.
Breathe in and out. Okay, George?

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:06.042
Yeah.

01:18:30.456 --> 01:18:32.129
- Come on, give it.
- No.

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:34.131
- Give it. Come on!
- No!

01:18:34.293 --> 01:18:36.091
- You're not careful. You'll break it.
- AI!

01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:39.845
- Please, I just wanna look at it.
- What've you got there?

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:47.724
- Hey, that's dangerous, sweetie.
- He bought it.

01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:48.978
What?

01:18:49.808 --> 01:18:51.401
It's a piece of the mirror George broke.

01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:52.899
Richard Smick is
selling them at school.

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:55.276
- Oh, you're kidding.
- It's hot. Feel it.

01:18:55.356 --> 01:18:57.199
It's not hot.

01:18:57.316 --> 01:19:00.490
Richard said the aliens probably
took George Malley away

01:19:00.611 --> 01:19:03.865
- and put this man in his place.
- This man?

01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:05.832
Like he's not human.

01:19:06.492 --> 01:19:09.462
That's really dumb,
and it's really mean.

01:19:11.038 --> 01:19:15.589
Can't they just look in his eyes
and see who he is'? Can't you?

01:19:15.668 --> 01:19:19.468
Do you remember when Daddy left,
how people treated us differently,

01:19:19.546 --> 01:19:21.799
even our so-called friends?

01:19:24.134 --> 01:19:27.729
Remember how much it hurt?
You don't do that to people.

01:19:30.808 --> 01:19:32.310
How much you pay for that?

01:19:32.393 --> 01:19:34.612
- A quarter.
- $1.

01:19:34.687 --> 01:19:36.109
What's the truth, Al?

01:19:36.188 --> 01:19:39.818
I paid $1.
I was gonna check it with my magnets.

01:19:40.818 --> 01:19:42.070
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

01:19:42.194 --> 01:19:44.697
Do you see something
really strange in there?

01:19:44.822 --> 01:19:46.540
- What?
- What?

01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:48.576
A sucker.

01:19:50.703 --> 01:19:51.795
No.

01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:54.043
- You paid $1 for nothing.
- You're a goner.

01:19:54.164 --> 01:19:55.711
Nice job, AI.

01:20:23.694 --> 01:20:24.866
Lace.

01:20:26.864 --> 01:20:27.956
Hi.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:34.126
Hi. I just called you.

01:20:34.246 --> 01:20:36.089
- You did?
- Mmm.

01:20:36.707 --> 01:20:38.425
Come in. Come in.

01:20:44.757 --> 01:20:47.306
I'm so, so glad you came.

01:20:47.426 --> 01:20:49.269
Well, I was just...

01:20:50.262 --> 01:20:52.481
Why were you calling?

01:20:52.598 --> 01:20:55.477
I found some things out, Lace.

01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:58.980
Things are coming clearer to me.

01:20:59.104 --> 01:21:01.698
I mean, at least, they're starting to.

01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:03.572
- Things?
- Mmm.

01:21:04.777 --> 01:21:06.950
I wanna talk to the people, Lace.

01:21:07.071 --> 01:21:10.496
I don't want them
to be scared of me or frightened.

01:21:11.241 --> 01:21:14.415
I mean, I wanna tell them what I know.

01:21:14.495 --> 01:21:17.965
So I've decided to speak
at the library fair.

01:21:19.458 --> 01:21:22.257
Do you think that they'll listen to me?

01:21:24.254 --> 01:21:26.757
What would they do,
throw stones?

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:32.889
Oh, my God. Please sit down.
I can't believe this.

01:21:32.971 --> 01:21:35.565
Would you like something to drink?
A beer?

01:21:35.641 --> 01:21:37.985
- No.
- What? What can I get you?

01:21:41.188 --> 01:21:42.531
Scissors.

01:23:30.923 --> 01:23:33.972
- Have you done this before?
- Nope.

01:23:34.092 --> 01:23:35.264
Hmm.

01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:45.233
- Up or down?
- Down.

01:24:26.353 --> 01:24:28.196
Is it close enough?

01:24:30.023 --> 01:24:31.525
You tell me.

01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:39.996
It's pretty close.

01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:59.853
You're running away?

01:25:03.724 --> 01:25:05.647
Are you coming back?

01:25:11.898 --> 01:25:13.024
Hmm.

01:25:16.987 --> 01:25:18.330
Hope so.

01:25:58.070 --> 01:26:00.493
Oh, hi, Doc. Welcome.

01:26:00.572 --> 01:26:03.121
Did you improve your mind
with all this reading?

01:26:03.784 --> 01:26:05.206
Yes, Doc.

01:26:05.869 --> 01:26:07.871
<i>Lady Chatterley's Lover?</i>

01:26:09.873 --> 01:26:11.216
Yeah, well...

01:26:11.291 --> 01:26:13.009
All right, well, you know,
that's kind of a...

01:26:13.085 --> 01:26:15.508
That's kind of a code book for anyone

01:26:15.587 --> 01:26:18.181
who wants to understand
a woman's heart and mind.

01:26:18.256 --> 01:26:19.974
I read it twice.

01:26:21.093 --> 01:26:22.345
Can you...

01:26:22.427 --> 01:26:25.897
Can you name the presidents forwards
and backwards for these people?

01:26:25.972 --> 01:26:29.476
No, but I can name some forward
presidents and some backward ones

01:26:31.561 --> 01:26:34.280
You know, I can really only tell you
what I've read in these books...

01:26:34.398 --> 01:26:35.445
He looks better.

01:26:35.565 --> 01:26:39.115
- ...And things I'm thinking about.
- Yeah. Yeah, he does.

01:26:39.236 --> 01:26:42.080
I seem to have an increased capacity
for learning right now.

01:26:42.155 --> 01:26:45.125
How do we know
you've read all these books?

01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:47.748
Well, ask me something.

01:26:47.828 --> 01:26:50.627
I'll be glad to answer
any question that you have, or a...

01:26:50.747 --> 01:26:55.344
How did you break that mirror, George,
without even touching it?

01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:57.804
Now, I wanna talk to you
about that, Banes,

01:26:57.921 --> 01:27:01.642
because I know you've been
worried about it, and...

01:27:01.758 --> 01:27:05.558
Okay, come here. Come here.
Everybody gather closely. I'm gonna...

01:27:05.637 --> 01:27:07.639
May I use your glasses?

01:27:09.307 --> 01:27:12.732
What you're about to see is not a trick.
Okay? It's just...

01:27:12.811 --> 01:27:15.439
Well, let's call it
an experiment in energy.

01:27:15.522 --> 01:27:17.024
Cool.

01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:18.571
- Well, everything there is...
- Are you getting this?

01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:21.199
...Is made up of
some living energy, okay?

01:27:21.319 --> 01:27:24.118
See, now, all this is, is kind of a dance

01:27:24.197 --> 01:27:27.792
or a partnership between
the energy coming from me

01:27:27.868 --> 01:27:30.462
and the energy of the plastic.

01:27:30.537 --> 01:27:33.666
- Now, that's it. See?
- Well, why can't we do it?

01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:38.136
Well, focus, clarity of thought.
I don't know.

01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:39.633
Maybe you can, Banes.

01:27:39.713 --> 01:27:41.681
What about the UFOs? What are they?

01:27:41.798 --> 01:27:43.175
I don't know that, either.

01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:45.769
Yes, you do. Yes, you do!

01:27:45.844 --> 01:27:49.690
Um, this power began the night
that you saw the object in the sky?

01:27:49.806 --> 01:27:53.151
That was a light. Now, now,
let me just finish this one thing.

01:27:53.226 --> 01:27:55.979
Now, now,
we're talking about a partnership.

01:27:56.062 --> 01:28:00.659
Now, do you know what the largest
living organism in the world is'?

01:28:00.734 --> 01:28:05.114
Okay, it's a grove of aspen trees
in Colorado, acres of aspens.

01:28:05.197 --> 01:28:07.700
Okay, now, they thought
they were disconnected, separate,

01:28:07.824 --> 01:28:09.497
but indeed they found out
that they weren't,

01:28:09.576 --> 01:28:13.171
that there was one giant organism
with the same root system.

01:28:13.246 --> 01:28:15.374
What sort of light was it?

01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:18.464
- Now, that's not unlike us.
- Answer the question!

01:28:18.543 --> 01:28:20.762
Why won't you tell us
what you know about the UFOs?

01:28:20.879 --> 01:28:22.472
- Are you sure it wasn't aliens?
- Can you move the table?

01:28:22.547 --> 01:28:23.890
How did you feel
when you saw that light?

01:28:24.007 --> 01:28:25.680
I think you know more
than you're telling us!

01:28:25.759 --> 01:28:27.477
- Now, imagine if you will...
- What'd the aliens look like?

01:28:27.552 --> 01:28:29.930
Have you seen the light
since the 28th?

01:28:30.055 --> 01:28:32.478
- We decided to be a partnership...
- Are you hiding something?

01:28:32.557 --> 01:28:35.481
- Say, come on!
- Just put your hands on my boy.

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:37.358
- It was aliens!
- Move the glasses some more.

01:28:37.437 --> 01:28:38.529
Can you bend spoons?

01:28:38.605 --> 01:28:40.778
- Now, we know what you can do.
- Hey, leave George alone!

01:28:40.899 --> 01:28:42.151
Why won't you touch the boy?

01:28:42.234 --> 01:28:44.453
Please? He's dying. Just do it.

01:28:45.195 --> 01:28:47.072
George! No!

01:28:52.869 --> 01:28:55.588
George. George,
can you see me, buddy?

01:28:56.581 --> 01:28:59.755
George. George, you okay?

01:29:14.891 --> 01:29:17.269
Mr. Malley? Are you all right?

01:29:47.132 --> 01:29:48.805
Good to see you.

01:29:51.928 --> 01:29:53.976
- You look sorrowful.
- No.

01:29:55.807 --> 01:29:59.857
What's the matter? Can't think of
any more tests to give me?

01:29:59.978 --> 01:30:03.482
How did you manage to get
your pressure to come down?

01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:06.447
Oh, I found my pace.

01:30:07.152 --> 01:30:10.907
Simple thing really. Hard to explain.

01:30:10.989 --> 01:30:12.741
Why, you figure I'm too thick?

01:30:12.824 --> 01:30:16.499
What I figure about you is
that you're stalling.

01:30:18.538 --> 01:30:21.542
I'm not stalling though. I'm waiting.

01:30:22.626 --> 01:30:25.345
- For what?
- Reinforcements.

01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:36.306
Well, you pick good people.

01:30:37.682 --> 01:30:39.025
You bet.

01:30:43.188 --> 01:30:44.485
See...

01:30:46.316 --> 01:30:48.034
George, George.

01:30:50.362 --> 01:30:55.243
There's a tumor in your brain
that's spread out like a hand.

01:30:55.659 --> 01:30:57.957
Threads of it, you know, everywhere.

01:30:58.036 --> 01:31:01.290
But instead of dysfunction...
Now here's the mystery, George.

01:31:01.373 --> 01:31:04.172
Instead of destroying brain function,

01:31:05.210 --> 01:31:06.712
so far, it's been stimulating it.

01:31:06.836 --> 01:31:09.965
And we can't understand that.

01:31:10.048 --> 01:31:15.145
You have more area of active brain use
than anybody ever tested. Ever.

01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:17.222
Because of those tentacles.

01:31:17.347 --> 01:31:19.190
I mean, we've seen
tumors like this before.

01:31:19.265 --> 01:31:21.484
It's called astrocytomas,

01:31:21.559 --> 01:31:28.534
and it explains the dizziness
and the illusion of light.

01:31:29.901 --> 01:31:33.576
But the way it's in there,
waking up areas of the brain,

01:31:33.697 --> 01:31:38.749
it's a big mystery.

01:31:39.744 --> 01:31:40.961
So...

01:31:41.871 --> 01:31:43.794
And it's killing me.

01:31:43.915 --> 01:31:45.633
- Well...
- For sure?

01:31:49.879 --> 01:31:51.677
We got a call from
the best brain man in the country.

01:31:51.756 --> 01:31:54.384
I mean, actually,
he's one of the best in the world.

01:31:54.467 --> 01:31:56.970
He's gonna study your tests
and then talk to you.

01:31:57.095 --> 01:31:58.221
Hmm.

01:31:58.304 --> 01:31:59.556
But...

01:32:01.307 --> 01:32:02.934
The blood flow is in danger now,

01:32:03.059 --> 01:32:08.782
and you're gonna start to weaken,
maybe black out.

01:32:10.775 --> 01:32:12.823
We really don't know. It's...

01:32:12.944 --> 01:32:16.289
But it's a damn lousy scenario,
you see'?

01:32:21.077 --> 01:32:23.455
Let me sit down here a minute.

01:32:28.668 --> 01:32:30.136
God damn it!

01:32:32.589 --> 01:32:34.637
Something happened
about 25 years ago

01:32:34.758 --> 01:32:37.386
when you broke your leg
and I set it, George.

01:32:37.469 --> 01:32:40.222
I don't know what to call it,

01:32:40.305 --> 01:32:43.479
but somehow you got into my heart
more than most.

01:32:45.268 --> 01:32:46.645
And for...

01:32:50.648 --> 01:32:52.992
And for a man
who's never been a father,

01:32:53.109 --> 01:32:55.658
I sure feel like I'm losing a son.

01:32:56.821 --> 01:32:57.993
Yeah.

01:33:00.617 --> 01:33:03.996
Georgie. Yeah.

01:33:10.293 --> 01:33:13.888
Can I do something for you, George?
Anything?

01:33:14.005 --> 01:33:15.131
Yes.

01:33:15.507 --> 01:33:18.511
Next spring,
when you plant the south 40,

01:33:19.469 --> 01:33:21.972
I want you to use the new fertilizer.

01:33:22.055 --> 01:33:24.604
I want you to put corn in that field,
and I know what you're thinking.

01:33:24.682 --> 01:33:28.232
You're thinking that it's
just too tough a crop. But it's not.

01:33:28.353 --> 01:33:32.654
I'm telling you, you'll get
four to five years without rotation.

01:33:32.732 --> 01:33:35.736
- Now, trust me on this.
- Hey.

01:33:39.239 --> 01:33:42.709
- I'm gonna wait outside.
- Okay.

01:33:42.826 --> 01:33:48.253
- Doc, you wanna come with?
- Yeah. Okay.

01:33:50.208 --> 01:33:51.551
Bye, Doc.

01:34:00.885 --> 01:34:05.061
Now, he didn't say how long.

01:34:09.352 --> 01:34:11.696
Days or weeks.

01:34:12.438 --> 01:34:15.032
They don't... They don't know.

01:34:15.108 --> 01:34:16.951
I'm so sorry, Lace.

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:22.624
I know how you hate surprises.

01:34:23.616 --> 01:34:26.290
I tried so hard not to love you.

01:34:26.411 --> 01:34:28.755
- How'd you make out?
- Terrible.

01:34:32.792 --> 01:34:36.763
Hey, would you love me
the rest of my life'?

01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:41.260
No. I'm gonna love you
for the rest of mine.

01:35:06.117 --> 01:35:09.667
George Malley? I'm Dr. Wellin.

01:35:11.456 --> 01:35:14.380
George, I'm recording this
because I'm going to be asking you

01:35:14.459 --> 01:35:18.430
some very important questions.
You ready?

01:35:19.088 --> 01:35:21.466
- Not another test.
- No.

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:25.895
No, no. No more tests. A dialog.

01:35:27.472 --> 01:35:29.145
I'm going to ask for your permission

01:35:29.224 --> 01:35:32.649
for my team to perform
open-brain surgery.

01:35:32.769 --> 01:35:36.740
But I don't want you to answer
till we've had our dialog, all right?

01:35:36.814 --> 01:35:39.158
But you said that this tumor
was inoperable.

01:35:39.317 --> 01:35:43.663
I think the odds are very small,
say, 1 in 500,

01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:45.657
that we'd be able to remove
enough of the tumor

01:35:45.782 --> 01:35:48.251
- to even prolong your life.
- Well, why...

01:35:48.326 --> 01:35:50.420
But what I want to explain is

01:35:50.495 --> 01:35:53.999
that this would not be
a life-saving operation.

01:35:54.958 --> 01:36:00.260
This would be... Call it an expedition.

01:36:01.798 --> 01:36:04.927
This would be a voyage of discovery.

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:08.684
You're in a position
to contribute as much to our knowledge

01:36:08.805 --> 01:36:11.979
as any man or woman
who's come before you.

01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:17.439
And if you were to wait
and do this operation

01:36:17.522 --> 01:36:20.025
after I'm done with my brain,
what would...

01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:22.777
If that's what you want, yes,
an autopsy,

01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:25.704
- that's all we'll do.
- But it wouldn't be as useful.

01:36:25.822 --> 01:36:30.043
The study of a living,
active brain would tell us volumes.

01:36:30.159 --> 01:36:33.038
All right, so if you were to do this
operation, wouldn't it most likely kill me

01:36:33.162 --> 01:36:35.130
or at least shorten my life?

01:36:35.206 --> 01:36:39.461
George, I'm asking you to try
and see the larger picture...

01:36:39.544 --> 01:36:40.841
Mmm-hmm.

01:36:41.004 --> 01:36:43.302
...To realize what you have to offer to us,

01:36:43.381 --> 01:36:46.225
the ones you're leaving behind.

01:36:46.342 --> 01:36:50.063
You could be
our greatest teacher, George, hmm?

01:36:51.306 --> 01:36:54.560
I can be your biographer, in a sense.

01:36:54.642 --> 01:36:58.988
- I can present you to the world.
- But that's not me.

01:36:59.063 --> 01:37:02.488
That's just my brain.
Do you understand?

01:37:02.567 --> 01:37:05.320
Look, Doctor, you know,
I might just have something to say

01:37:05.403 --> 01:37:08.828
in my last few hours.
I just might have something to say.

01:37:08.906 --> 01:37:11.750
What you're saying is that
I have something to teach.

01:37:11.868 --> 01:37:15.247
And yet you're willing to end me
to study my brain under a microscope.

01:37:15.371 --> 01:37:16.918
Now, is that all I'm here for?

01:37:16.998 --> 01:37:18.591
What else? You're not a scholar or a...

01:37:18.666 --> 01:37:21.340
I'll tell you what I am, okay?
I'll tell you what I think I am.

01:37:21.419 --> 01:37:23.012
I think I'm what everybody can be.

01:37:23.087 --> 01:37:24.930
Everyone with a malignant, tentacled...

01:37:25.006 --> 01:37:29.352
No, no, no. No, no, it's...
That just helped me get here, okay?

01:37:29.427 --> 01:37:34.228
I mean, anybody can get here.
It's... I'm the possibility, all right?

01:37:35.767 --> 01:37:38.862
I mean, I think you've got this
desperate grasp on technology

01:37:38.936 --> 01:37:40.108
and this grasp on science,

01:37:40.188 --> 01:37:43.112
and you don't have a hand left
to grasp what's important.

01:37:43.191 --> 01:37:44.864
- George. Now, George...
- If had to chose between a tumor

01:37:44.942 --> 01:37:47.786
that got me here and some flash
of light from an alien craft,

01:37:47.904 --> 01:37:50.953
I'd choose the tumor, I would,
because it's here within us.

01:37:51.032 --> 01:37:53.626
What I'm talking about
is the human spirit.

01:37:53.701 --> 01:37:55.874
That's the challenge.
That's the voyage.

01:37:55.953 --> 01:37:57.921
That's the expedition.

01:38:02.043 --> 01:38:07.971
You need to go now. I need my rest,
and I wanna go home.

01:38:28.277 --> 01:38:31.827
Hey, hey, hey. I tried to release
my patient. Now, what's going on?

01:38:31.906 --> 01:38:32.998
- It's done.
- What's done?

01:38:33.116 --> 01:38:35.995
We didn't feel George Malley
was competent to make the decision.

01:38:36.119 --> 01:38:37.917
He's a surgical patient now.

01:38:37.995 --> 01:38:40.589
What did you tell the judge?
That you could save him'?

01:38:40.665 --> 01:38:44.260
- I might prolong his life, yes.
- Bullshit.

01:38:44.335 --> 01:38:47.339
If he were rational, he'd say yes.
You know he would.

01:38:47.964 --> 01:38:50.968
Now I know why you guys wear masks.

01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:57.181
<i>Yeah, if it was light enough,</i>

01:38:57.306 --> 01:38:58.523
<i>he could've been blowing on it
with his breath.</i>

01:38:58.683 --> 01:39:03.154
He could've had a string,
so thin, you know, like catgut.

01:39:04.188 --> 01:39:05.861
And he could've had it on his finger
and on the glasses,

01:39:05.982 --> 01:39:07.359
and he could've made it move that way.

01:39:07.442 --> 01:39:09.115
Don't you think he could've

01:39:09.193 --> 01:39:11.696
thrown something
at that mirror somehow?

01:39:11.821 --> 01:39:13.789
- We just didn't see it.
- No way.

01:39:13.865 --> 01:39:15.993
That quake could've been
a coincidence.

01:39:16.325 --> 01:39:17.952
He just thought he knew stuff.

01:39:18.035 --> 01:39:20.629
I mean, he just studied harder
on the Spanish, that's all.

01:39:20.705 --> 01:39:22.548
It's not like he really knew stuff.

01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:25.467
Just studied hard at chess
and made us think he was changing,

01:39:25.543 --> 01:39:28.547
but, you know,
he never really changed at all.

01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:30.302
Isn't that right, Doc?

01:39:30.381 --> 01:39:34.181
I mean, he never really got
any smarter. Doc?

01:39:35.344 --> 01:39:37.062
Banes.

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:40.061
How's your lady love?

01:39:42.226 --> 01:39:44.900
We broke up.

01:39:45.021 --> 01:39:48.742
Really'? That's too bad, yeah.

01:39:49.484 --> 01:39:52.237
Now, George, he's got a love at
his side, and she's sticking with him.

01:39:52.361 --> 01:39:56.241
You know why?
Because he bought her chairs.

01:39:56.324 --> 01:39:58.372
That's pretty smart to me.

01:39:59.577 --> 01:40:01.750
You ever buy Lisa's chairs?

01:40:02.205 --> 01:40:05.004
God, Doc's really drunk tonight.

01:40:05.082 --> 01:40:06.584
Every woman has her chairs,

01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:09.713
something she needs to
put herself into, Banes.

01:40:11.339 --> 01:40:14.388
You ever figure out
what Lisa's chairs were, and buy them?

01:40:16.886 --> 01:40:18.058
Nope.

01:40:19.764 --> 01:40:22.608
But you're right about one thing.
George never changed.

01:40:22.725 --> 01:40:24.693
Never. No, never.

01:40:29.357 --> 01:40:31.451
Doc's making no sense tonight.

01:40:31.526 --> 01:40:34.075
Yeah. Maybe he caught it from George.

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:38.624
- Now, God damn it, Doc!
- Why do you have to tear him down?

01:40:38.699 --> 01:40:41.293
What are you so afraid of?
What have you got to lose?

01:40:41.369 --> 01:40:44.873
He wasn't selling anything.
He didn't want anything from anybody!

01:40:44.956 --> 01:40:49.803
He wanted nothing from nobody!
Nothing! Nothing!

01:40:52.964 --> 01:40:56.389
And you people have to tear him down,
so you can sleep better tonight?

01:40:56.467 --> 01:41:00.722
So you can prove that the world is flat,
and sleep better tonight? Am I right?

01:41:09.146 --> 01:41:10.819
I'm right.

01:41:15.778 --> 01:41:18.657
To hell with all of you.
To hell with every one of you.

01:41:28.541 --> 01:41:33.297
Hey, George. How you doing?
Here you go. Drink up.

01:41:33.379 --> 01:41:35.552
All right.

01:41:37.717 --> 01:41:39.310
Good job.

01:41:40.469 --> 01:41:43.063
Don't take the pudding.
That's the good part.

01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:46.893
- Hey, is Cal around?
- Sure. Do you wanna see him?

01:41:46.976 --> 01:41:49.320
- Yeah, thanks.
- Okay.

01:42:16.005 --> 01:42:17.348
- Hey, dude.
- Hey, man.

01:42:17.423 --> 01:42:18.845
- How's it going?
- All right.

01:42:18.924 --> 01:42:21.302
- Can you stay for a few minutes?
- Sure.

01:42:21.385 --> 01:42:23.183
Saved you some pudding again.

01:42:23.262 --> 01:42:26.687
What a buddy. I love this stuff.

01:42:32.438 --> 01:42:33.564
Night, dude.

01:42:48.913 --> 01:42:51.541
- Hey, Doc, you seen him?
- Seen who? What?

01:42:51.624 --> 01:42:52.876
George Malley. He's out.
He sneaked out.

01:42:52.958 --> 01:42:54.710
We're looking all over for him.

01:42:55.544 --> 01:42:57.012
- He's out?
- Yeah, he flew the coop.

01:42:57.088 --> 01:42:59.216
Nobody knows where he is.
I heard it on the radio.

01:42:59.298 --> 01:43:00.925
Flew the coop. Those FBI guys

01:43:01.008 --> 01:43:02.931
are going to have me
driving around all night.

01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:05.934
I'm gonna be home late again.
My wife is gonna kill me.

01:43:13.229 --> 01:43:15.903
I want you to take these
and give them to Doc.

01:43:15.981 --> 01:43:18.951
These I'm taking with me,
because I haven't finished them yet.

01:43:19.026 --> 01:43:21.154
They're for Dr. Ringold.

01:43:22.571 --> 01:43:27.202
This I wrote for you, Nate. It's about
soils, and some of my own thoughts.

01:43:27.702 --> 01:43:28.999
- Your thoughts?
- Yeah.

01:43:31.956 --> 01:43:35.051
- I could drive you.
- No. No, Nate, it's too chancy.

01:43:36.627 --> 01:43:39.597
- You can make it. Yeah.
- Nate.

01:44:30.598 --> 01:44:33.397
- I'll get it.
- Then you put the top on.

01:44:41.192 --> 01:44:43.194
- Leave me alone.
- I didn't do it, Al

01:44:48.949 --> 01:44:51.919
Is that tight enough?
Why don't you do it once more?

01:44:54.747 --> 01:44:56.715
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

01:45:02.922 --> 01:45:04.219
There you go.

01:45:04.298 --> 01:45:06.221
Good. Now you've fixed it.

01:45:12.014 --> 01:45:13.561
What?

01:45:15.768 --> 01:45:18.066
You came here to die, didn't you?

01:45:24.276 --> 01:45:28.782
But I like this place,
and I love the people here.

01:45:56.392 --> 01:46:00.943
You know,
if we were to put this apple down

01:46:02.147 --> 01:46:07.028
and leave it, it would be spoiled
and gone within a few days.

01:46:07.778 --> 01:46:11.658
But if we were to take a bite of it,
like this,

01:46:12.825 --> 01:46:18.047
it would become part of us,
and we could take it with us forever.

01:46:38.142 --> 01:46:44.866
Al, everything is on its way
to somewhere.

01:46:46.442 --> 01:46:47.659
Everything.

01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:10.132
That's a good bite.

01:47:32.696 --> 01:47:34.369
Keep an eye out.

01:47:44.458 --> 01:47:46.756
Have you seen George Malley,
Ms Pennamin?

01:47:47.419 --> 01:47:49.046
What's the point?

01:47:51.298 --> 01:47:53.471
Look, it's not my call.

01:47:55.427 --> 01:47:56.974
I haven't seen him.

01:48:17.950 --> 01:48:20.544
- You mind if I get in your truck?
- Why?

01:48:34.967 --> 01:48:37.311
What's your first name?

01:48:40.055 --> 01:48:43.650
- Jack.
- How would you want to die, Jack?

01:48:55.654 --> 01:48:56.826
Come on, let's go.

01:49:13.047 --> 01:49:14.924
There you are.

01:49:18.135 --> 01:49:20.354
I knew I'd find you here.

01:49:21.889 --> 01:49:23.812
What are you working on?

01:49:24.516 --> 01:49:28.191
Dr. Ringold's coming tomorrow,
and I just wanted to finish this up.

01:49:28.937 --> 01:49:32.362
- Finish what?
- Just some possibilities.

01:49:34.777 --> 01:49:37.030
Hey, come sit by me.

01:49:38.864 --> 01:49:40.036
Hmm?

01:49:41.742 --> 01:49:44.336
- You scared?
- No.

01:49:46.497 --> 01:49:49.876
- I wish I knew what you feel.
- Oh, you do.

01:49:51.043 --> 01:49:54.764
You've always known it, Lace.
I'll show you.

01:49:55.839 --> 01:49:59.139
When your children were babies,
how did you hold them?

01:50:03.180 --> 01:50:07.902
And if they had a hard time sleeping
and you had to rock them to sleep,

01:50:07.976 --> 01:50:09.603
well, how did you do it?

01:50:31.792 --> 01:50:33.044
See?

01:50:36.964 --> 01:50:39.592
Hey, look what I made back there.

01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:43.433
That looks like a bed.

01:50:45.055 --> 01:50:47.399
Are you expecting to get lucky?

01:50:47.474 --> 01:50:50.478
No. Just hoping.

01:52:23.695 --> 01:52:26.118
Hey, I've never kissed you there.

01:52:26.198 --> 01:52:28.792
- No. Keeping track?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:52:35.249 --> 01:52:37.092
You going to sleep?

01:52:37.751 --> 01:52:39.094
Mmm-mmm.

01:52:39.836 --> 01:52:41.634
- Are you?
- No.

01:52:42.464 --> 01:52:45.513
I don't want to sleep
unless you're sleeping.

01:52:45.592 --> 01:52:47.560
I don't want to...

01:52:54.226 --> 01:52:56.069
- Lace.
- What?

01:52:56.645 --> 01:52:58.693
- Sweetheart.
- What?

01:53:03.402 --> 01:53:06.997
- Now, you have to listen to me, now.
- What?

01:53:12.327 --> 01:53:14.830
- It's happening.
- No.

01:53:14.913 --> 01:53:16.005
Mmm-hmm.

01:53:16.081 --> 01:53:18.834
No. Wait, George, wait.

01:53:20.794 --> 01:53:23.422
- No.
- And it's gonna be okay.

01:53:25.882 --> 01:53:30.388
- George.
- It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

01:53:32.556 --> 01:53:33.773
Okay.

01:53:36.935 --> 01:53:38.482
Goodbye, honey.

01:53:40.063 --> 01:53:41.189
No.

01:54:26.777 --> 01:54:30.452
Hello, I'm John Ringold.
I'm here to see George Malley.

01:54:32.741 --> 01:54:37.121
Oh. I'm sorry, John.
George Malley passed away last night.

01:54:42.334 --> 01:54:44.052
Well, I'm sorry.

01:54:50.342 --> 01:54:52.310
He left these for you.

01:54:56.890 --> 01:55:01.316
He said they're not finished.
You'll have to do it.

01:55:06.066 --> 01:55:07.784
I'll do my best.

01:55:10.237 --> 01:55:12.456
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:55:16.326 --> 01:55:17.919
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

01:56:44.581 --> 01:56:46.424
Thank you, sweetie.

01:57:36.216 --> 01:57:40.346
- Nate, they'll be waiting for you.
- We're coming. We're coming.

01:58:09.916 --> 01:58:10.917
Beautiful.

01:58:15.213 --> 01:58:16.339
Oh.

01:58:18.592 --> 01:58:21.391
It's okay. It's okay.

01:58:23.805 --> 01:58:25.227
Hey, Nate.

01:58:29.102 --> 01:58:30.604
What am I gonna do
with the drinks, though?

01:58:30.687 --> 01:58:32.234
What am I gonna do?

01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:47.167
It's not here. I'll tell you where it is.
It's right there!

01:58:47.245 --> 01:58:50.169
- How'd you do that?
- How'd I do that? It's magic.

01:58:51.374 --> 01:58:54.002
Can you hear her? She just kicked...

01:58:55.712 --> 01:58:57.931
- Have a cold one.
- Thank you.

01:58:58.006 --> 01:59:00.680
- You getting any rest?
- Not much.

01:59:00.759 --> 01:59:05.356
Well, get it now, because there's
no sleeping once the baby gets there.
