And for a while,
I was treated like a gift.

My father, he's had his chances.
Honestly, you've done more for me

00:20.041 --> 00:22.666
in the past few days
than my father's done in my entire life.

00:22.666 --> 00:25.250

Okay. Uh, just one problem with this plan.

02:55.250 --> 02:57.791
The police think
that we crashed an Amtrak train

03:02.500 --> 03:04.875
- Th-- The cops are after us?
- Yeah.

03:05.791 --> 03:08.291
Isn't that gonna make it hard for us
to get on a train?

Or a bus?
Or really anything you need tickets for?

I think this quest might be harder
than we thought.

03:26.833 --> 03:28.125
I've been thinking.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.916
I didn't steal the master bolt.
You guys didn't steal the master bolt.

03:31.250 --> 03:32.958
We're pretty sure
Hades has the master bolt,

03:33.083 --> 03:34.958
but he couldn't have stolen it himself.

03:35.291 --> 03:38.208
I mean, we don't even know
who actually stole the thing,

03:38.583 --> 03:41.583
or why, or how deep this goes.

03:45.083 --> 03:47.000
I'm the last person to realize this,
aren't I?

03:48.625 --> 03:50.916
- Yeah.
- [sighs] Okay, so...

03:51.791 --> 03:54.208
maybe when we started,
my head wasn't fully in this,

03:54.208 --> 03:55.708
but since the river...

03:57.875 --> 03:59.541
it all feels different somehow.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
He saved me.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.791
My dad.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.708
I guess I just really never thought
that's something he'd do for me.

So maybe I gotta take things
more seriously now.

- Car.

04:16.750 --> 04:20.041
That's not a car, it's a bike.
Just let it pass. Come on.

04:25.208 --> 04:27.875
I'm saying,
we're not just trying to retrieve a thing.

04:28.375 --> 04:30.416
I think we might need
to be detectives here, too.

04:31.708 --> 04:32.708
Yeah.

04:34.333 --> 04:37.541
Why are you being weird with me again?
I thought we weren't doing that anymore.

04:37.750 --> 04:39.208
- I'm not being weird.
- Yes, you are.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.041
You've been weird since we left the Arch.

04:44.208 --> 04:47.458
Oh... I get it.

04:49.375 --> 04:52.041
It doesn't have to be a thing, you know.
That you hugged me.

04:53.708 --> 04:57.208
- [sighs] Oh, boy.
- I mean, we're like friends now.

04:57.583 --> 04:59.208
That seems like a thing friends do.

04:59.916 --> 05:02.166
- At least I think they do.
- I saw the Fates.

05:04.416 --> 05:09.041
Back at the Arch, I saw the Three Fates,
and I saw Atropos cut a piece of thread.

05:10.041 --> 05:11.958
And that's bad or...?

05:12.625 --> 05:15.416
The Fates weave the life strand
of every living thing.

05:16.166 --> 05:19.000

- It means one of us is going to die.

05:20.541 --> 05:23.416
- We're all gonna die eventually.
- Soon.

You're new to the family, young one,

See, years before I was born,
my grandpa Kronos

09:25.708 --> 09:27.583
ate my aunts and uncles.

09:28.125 --> 09:30.458
Yeah. Then my dad made him puke
them back up,

09:30.625 --> 09:34.083
then chopped him into a million pieces
and chucked 'em into a bottomless pit,

09:34.083 --> 09:35.791
so that kinda set the tone
right outta the gate.

09:36.791 --> 09:39.833

27:09.625 --> 27:10.625
Thank you.

27:13.208 --> 27:14.875
I was gonna say, when this quest is done,

27:14.875 --> 27:18.333
can you maybe swing back here
and try to get me outta this thing?

27:19.125 --> 27:20.125
[scoffs]

27:21.750 --> 27:23.208
You think you had to ask?

27:25.750 --> 27:26.875
Just making sure.

27:37.166 --> 27:38.416
[sniffs]

27:41.333 --> 27:42.583
[sighs]

27:46.916 --> 27:49.708
- [machinery creaking]
- [♪ music intensifies]

27:49.708 --> 27:52.541
[breathes heavily] This is weird.

27:53.708 --> 27:56.916
It's... warm.

28:07.958 --> 28:09.500
This is a bad idea. Stand up.

28:11.083 --> 28:12.083
I can't.

28:12.583 --> 28:14.708
- Percy, stand up, I mean it.
- [Percy] It's okay.

28:17.083 --> 28:18.083
I'm okay.

28:20.458 --> 28:21.541
I'm okay.

28:23.833 --> 28:24.916
I'm okay.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
I'm--

28:29.125 --> 28:31.458
[♪ music concludes]

28:45.416 --> 28:48.458
[♪ somber instrumental music playing]

28:50.750 --> 28:52.083
[sniffles]

28:52.708 --> 28:54.291
[thunder rumbles]

29:04.791 --> 29:09.708
[breathes shakily]

29:13.458 --> 29:16.041
[♪ dramatic instrumental music playing]

29:19.791 --> 29:21.625
[gears creaking]

29:30.458 --> 29:31.833
[grunts]

29:35.583 --> 29:37.125
[♪ music concludes]

29:37.125 --> 29:38.416
[fairground worker] Can I help you?

29:42.458 --> 29:44.208
Do you need some help
finding your way out?

29:45.166 --> 29:48.791
- [♪ plays harmonious melody on flute]
- [gears rumbling]

29:48.958 --> 29:52.000
[♪ tense instrumental music playing]

29:52.166 --> 29:53.500
[fairground worker] So, off you go.

29:57.333 --> 29:58.750
I'm not leaving without my friend.

29:58.875 --> 30:00.750
[fairground worker]
Yeah, that isn't really how it works.

30:01.125 --> 30:04.208
It's kind of a one-way sort of thing.
It can't be undone.

30:05.791 --> 30:08.583
- How do you know?
- Because I built it.

30:09.583 --> 30:11.375
[♪ poignant instrumental music playing]

30:18.041 --> 30:19.458
[sighs]

30:19.458 --> 30:21.250
I'm not leaving here without my friend.

30:22.458 --> 30:24.500
And if you aren't going to help me,

30:24.625 --> 30:28.125
could you maybe leave me alone
so I can focus?

30:28.375 --> 30:30.333
[Hephaestus] In spite of what my brother
might've told you,

30:30.458 --> 30:32.500
I am not someone who'll be pushed around.

30:32.666 --> 30:34.916
[♪ tense instrumental music resumes]

30:34.916 --> 30:37.958
I know your mother was displeased
with you recently.

30:39.833 --> 30:44.125
We both know how she gets.
But this was a lot.

30:45.291 --> 30:46.291
Even for her.

30:47.708 --> 30:49.208
You walk outta here with that shield...

30:50.500 --> 30:53.458
and you're a hero.
On your way to the greatest glory.

30:54.500 --> 30:57.416
She'll be proud and you will be forgiven,

30:58.166 --> 31:00.416
and all will go back
to being as it always has been,

31:00.833 --> 31:01.875
always will be...

31:03.083 --> 31:06.791
- as it should be.
- It isn't how it should be! It isn't!

31:07.958 --> 31:12.000
Eat or be eaten. Power and glory
and nothing else matters.

31:14.083 --> 31:19.750
Ares is that way, Zeus is that way,
my mother is that way.

31:20.708 --> 31:23.375
[♪ somber instrumental music playing]

31:28.583 --> 31:30.250
He isn't that way.

31:32.041 --> 31:33.250
He's better than that.

31:35.125 --> 31:37.041
Maybe I was that way once.

31:38.083 --> 31:40.458
But I don't wanna be that way anymore.

31:44.500 --> 31:45.875
I won't be like all of you.

31:47.541 --> 31:49.250
I just won't.

32:05.875 --> 32:09.166
[♪ plays harmonious melody on flute]

32:38.666 --> 32:39.666
[grunts]

32:41.125 --> 32:43.000
[Hephaestus] Some of us don't like being
that way either.

32:45.583 --> 32:47.041
You're a good kid, Annabeth.

32:50.083 --> 32:52.000
I'll put in a good word
with your mom for you.

32:52.125 --> 32:54.291
[♪ somber instrumental music playing]

33:08.625 --> 33:11.125

33:11.291 --> 33:14.041
[♪ epic instrumental music playing]

33:32.958 --> 33:33.958
Where's our ride?

33:36.583 --> 33:38.875
[♪ music concludes]

33:40.625 --> 33:41.666
You're kidding.

33:47.875 --> 33:50.583
Get in, don't. I really don't care.

33:50.583 --> 33:54.250
But in a few hours, this thing is gonna be
at the Lotus Casino in Vegas.

33:54.458 --> 33:56.833
Hermes hangs out there.
You play your cards right

33:56.958 --> 33:59.583
and his personal driver can get you
to L.A. in minutes.

34:00.083 --> 34:04.500
Here. Clothes. Cash.
Drachmas to summon Hermes.

34:04.833 --> 34:07.333
I'd wish you luck,
but what good would it do you?

34:07.625 --> 34:08.791
We're not gonna fail.

34:09.833 --> 34:12.750
Don't worry. Your dad had plenty of kids

34:12.750 --> 34:15.958
he stopped caring about
once he lost interest.

34:16.291 --> 34:19.125
- You'll have lots of company.
- [Percy] We're not gonna fail,

34:19.541 --> 34:21.166
and I'm getting pretty tired
of you saying it.

34:21.166 --> 34:22.250
[Grover] Percy.

34:22.250 --> 34:25.333
You think you know who I am,
but you don't.

34:26.208 --> 34:27.458
And if you aren't careful...

34:28.500 --> 34:29.625
you're gonna find out.

34:31.041 --> 34:33.916
- Percy...
- [♪ tense instrumental music playing]

34:34.041 --> 34:37.750
So, thank you for the emotional abuse
and the cheeseburgers...

34:38.583 --> 34:41.083
and the ride.
We're gonna take you up on that, too.

34:50.833 --> 34:53.458
Hey, do you think we could get
some paper towels or something,

34:53.458 --> 34:54.875
it's not that nice in here.

34:58.333 --> 35:02.625
- [♪ music concludes]
- [animals clamoring]

35:03.958 --> 35:07.375
[Percy] Well... this smells.

35:08.166 --> 35:10.416
If it gets us where we need
to go, that's all that matters.

35:10.625 --> 35:12.625
[Percy] Assuming Ares
was telling the truth.

35:13.291 --> 35:16.791
He wasn't.
Not entirely, at any rate.

35:18.291 --> 35:19.625
He was holding something back.

35:20.333 --> 35:23.791
- How do you know?
- Because I think I got it out of him.

35:24.375 --> 35:26.041
[♪ suspenseful instrumental music playing]

35:28.125 --> 35:29.708
I know who stole the master bolt.

[♪ theme music playing]

37:17.916 --> 37:19.583
[Percy] <i>There's more to this
than just the bolt.</i>

37:20.166 --> 37:21.166
<i>Something bigger.</i>

37:22.041 --> 37:24.041
Hey, demigods. Welcome.

37:24.625 --> 37:25.666
We have a huge problem.
