WEBVTT

02:07.043 --> 02:10.378
Bobby.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.422
No!

03:37.884 --> 03:39.426
All right, we lined up?

03:40.136 --> 03:41.803
Get that line.

03:49.479 --> 03:52.189
Put the stern line on quick.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.754
Bobby!

04:20.093 --> 04:21.635
Hey, baby!

04:30.395 --> 04:31.561
Missed you.

04:37.068 --> 04:39.278
Hey, big man, how you doing?

04:46.369 --> 04:48.704
-Hey, Murph!
-Hey, Ethel.

04:49.038 --> 04:50.831
How you doing? Welcome home.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.208
-You seen Deb and my boy?
-No, I'm sorry.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.459
Ma!

04:56.713 --> 04:59.131
-How you doing, beautiful?
-Hello, Bobby.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.801
Home safe.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.435
Who's that?

05:13.062 --> 05:15.063
-Ol' Ben.
-No.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.482
Poor old guy.

05:18.776 --> 05:19.985
Hey, Linda.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.946
-Hey, boss.
-What's the score?

05:26.200 --> 05:27.409
My kind of numbers.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.995
I lost Ben Pulley.
He passed away onboard.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.082
Sorry to hear that.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.959
How'd you hit it, Billy?

05:38.671 --> 05:40.380
Didn't hit very hard, did you?

05:40.590 --> 05:43.592
We all have slumps, but you're overdue
to break out of yours.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.261
Did you hear the lady?
Ben Pulley's dead.

05:46.429 --> 05:50.849
That old man pickled himself to death
drinking 7&7s chasing Narragansetts.

05:51.059 --> 05:55.270
Linda, with Ben, it was never
a question of "if," but "when."

05:55.938 --> 05:57.814
-I'll bury him.
-I'll pay for it.

05:58.232 --> 05:59.733
See, you got what you wanted.

06:00.276 --> 06:03.445
Bring in your fish.
It shouldn't take too long.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.030
8-5.

07:35.329 --> 07:36.705
<i>4-7 -5.</i>

07:58.144 --> 07:59.227
Murph.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.814
Sign my ledger.

08:04.734 --> 08:05.942
Shatford.

08:07.945 --> 08:09.488
Sign my ledger.

08:13.910 --> 08:14.910
What's the matter?

08:15.119 --> 08:16.995
It's $2221.
Aren't we a little short?

08:20.041 --> 08:22.876
We were sharing up last night.
I thought it'd be three plus.

08:25.755 --> 08:30.509
You stocked 21,000 pounds at 3.50
a pound. That comes to $73,000.

08:30.760 --> 08:35.388
Minus $35,000 for bait, tackle, fuel.
That comes out to $38,500.

08:35.681 --> 08:37.224
I get half. I own the boat.

08:37.390 --> 08:40.268
Your captain takes double share,
four crewmen get a share each.

08:40.436 --> 08:43.104
And a rookie like you,
three-quarters share.

08:43.272 --> 08:46.358
That comes to $2221.

08:46.984 --> 08:48.401
What it is, is what it is.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.278
Sign the ledger.

08:56.994 --> 08:58.161
Moran.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.709
You going out again this season,
skipper?

09:04.919 --> 09:06.086
Why?

09:07.547 --> 09:08.922
You got a site in Florida?

09:11.509 --> 09:12.968
Bradenton Beach.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.428
<i>The Cecile.</i>

09:16.847 --> 09:18.765
Pack your shit and get out.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.851
You like Florida?

09:23.020 --> 09:25.564
Well, it beats the Grand Banks
in October.

09:26.232 --> 09:29.484
It gets rough up here,
Dougie likes the sun down there.

09:30.444 --> 09:32.821
Or he thinks he'll score better
with another captain.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.072
I didn't say that.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.074
Yes, you did.

09:37.868 --> 09:38.868
Goodbye.

09:40.079 --> 09:44.916
Here's your cut. $5923.76.
Sign the ledger.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.211
That's a record low for you,
isn't it?

09:48.671 --> 09:51.881
Next time, track Linda.
She'll take you where the fish are.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.051
You're getting to be rude, you know?

09:55.386 --> 09:57.887
I like you, Billy.
I always have.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.556
But I like my boat better.

09:59.765 --> 10:02.851
If you can't make it pay,
I'll find somebody who can.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.186
You trying to put a charge up my ass?

10:06.188 --> 10:07.981
You're on a cold streak.

10:08.190 --> 10:10.066
I'm encouraging you
to catch fish.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.694
I'll bring you more fish
than you ever dreamed of.

10:12.903 --> 10:15.614
Next time I fish the Grand Banks,
they won't be so grand.

10:15.823 --> 10:17.782
You just struck out
on the Grand Banks.

10:17.992 --> 10:19.075
Then I'll go further.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.955
Don't even think about it.
I want my boat back.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.041
And l want to catch some fish.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.250
It's what I do.

10:27.960 --> 10:28.960
Not lately.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.546
Want to yank my site, you go ahead.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.735
-Murph.
-Hey, skip.

10:55.905 --> 10:58.698
What are you doing out here?
Get in there. Get drunk.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.076
Waiting on my ex...

11:01.619 --> 11:02.952
...and my son.

11:07.458 --> 11:10.085
Give him lots of
hugs and kisses tonight.

11:10.961 --> 11:13.755
You don't gotta remind me
to do that, skip.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.803
Ladies, you're looking fine.
How you doing?

11:20.012 --> 11:22.514
Can I buy you a drink?
What, what, what?

11:29.355 --> 11:30.814
Hey, rookie.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.526
What are you so happy about?

11:35.653 --> 11:38.780
It wasn't exactly a slammer
up on the Grand Banks.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.615
Isn't it past your bedtime?

11:42.493 --> 11:44.244
Bugs, how you making out?

11:44.453 --> 11:45.829
I'm not.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.458
I don't know.
Maybe I smell like fish.

11:50.668 --> 11:53.962
-You need a new deodorant.
-Maybe l need a new face.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.384
Frickin' Alfred Pierre.

12:00.594 --> 12:04.556
They were upstairs, they come down,
a little refreshment.

12:04.765 --> 12:06.641
Now they're going back up again.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.519
Half an hour ago, they shook
the lamps over the bar.

12:09.729 --> 12:13.481
Last time she brought her sister.
You should've seen the lamps then.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.318
How do he do it, mon?

12:17.486 --> 12:20.321
I think he's fishin'
with a longer pole, Bugs.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.459
What happened?

12:32.668 --> 12:36.796
They had a sale on kids' shoes
at Ames.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.173
Sorry.

12:39.550 --> 12:40.967
No problem.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.261
Hi.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.679
Hello.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.309
So you want to have a drink?

12:52.062 --> 12:53.188
Come on, Debra.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.356
What do you say, for old times' sake?

12:55.566 --> 12:57.734
It was the old times that killed us.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.738
Is that what it was?

13:05.367 --> 13:06.618
There you go.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.871
I'm a little short.
It wasn't exactly a slammer.

13:10.831 --> 13:11.831
Half for you.

13:13.918 --> 13:14.918
You sure?

13:15.127 --> 13:16.252
Yeah, I'm working.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.384
Want to come with your daddy?

13:25.387 --> 13:26.805
Shoot some pool?

13:29.225 --> 13:30.683
Have a drink?

13:36.565 --> 13:38.650
Just bring him home in an hour.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.838
Good shot, buddy.

14:00.130 --> 14:02.757
All right, Sully, you think about it.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.092
All right?

14:07.429 --> 14:09.055
Bugs.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.475
Murph, come here.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.603
Here comes your fearless leader,
Captain Billy Tyne.

14:15.771 --> 14:18.606
I got a feeling skipper's
coming to give us bad news.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.610
Lady's not only pretty, she's smart.

14:24.613 --> 14:26.322
Yeah, we're going back out.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.449
What'd I tell you?

14:30.160 --> 14:32.203
-When?
-A few days.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.621
"Few" means two?

14:34.164 --> 14:35.206
Two days is right.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.083
Skip, we just got back in.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.919
You don't want your site,
a replacement's a call away.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.341
Join me, don't join me.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.511
There's time for one last shot.
The Andrea Gail will take it.

14:48.679 --> 14:52.265
This time I promise you, we'll
come back with a shitload of fish.

14:52.683 --> 14:54.392
Excuse me, men, madam.

15:00.316 --> 15:01.649
What are you gonna do?

15:02.151 --> 15:05.153
I'm gonna tell him to
stick his head up his ass.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.738
I'd like to hear that.

15:07.698 --> 15:08.740
Hear what?

15:08.949 --> 15:11.492
I'd like to hear you tell him
to stick it up his ass.

15:11.702 --> 15:12.994
Go on, Bob.

15:17.708 --> 15:21.461
Yeah, that's just how l'll tell him
as soon as we get back.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.212
You're a bastard.

15:23.839 --> 15:26.090
Why? Why do I even love you?

15:26.300 --> 15:28.051
-Come on.
-No. Why? Why, Bobby?

15:28.552 --> 15:31.512
When you get the answer, tell me.
I could use it myself.

15:31.972 --> 15:34.682
-Get laid, Bugsy.
-Easy for you to say.

15:43.984 --> 15:45.276
Go on up there.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.278
Don't make the same mistake l did.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.457
You're going away again?

16:01.794 --> 16:03.127
Yeah.

16:03.712 --> 16:05.755
Take me with you.

16:09.718 --> 16:11.010
Come here.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.390
Go back, Bobby.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.935
Go back to what you did before.

16:19.144 --> 16:22.188
-Pack cod, repair tackle.
-I'm sick of that.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.190
It's safe and it pays.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.401
Not enough.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.112
Just one more time. I promise.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.073
I have to try it again.
We need the money, baby.

16:32.282 --> 16:34.909
Money. It's always about the money.

16:35.744 --> 16:39.914
Well, I got a divorce lawyer,
a mountain of debt.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.836
And there's your two kids.
You gotta get them back.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.965
Do you think you'll love them?

16:49.341 --> 16:51.092
They're yours, aren't they?

17:10.945 --> 17:12.446
Hey, beautiful.

17:12.740 --> 17:13.865
Yeah, you.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.534
Buy you a drink?

17:17.786 --> 17:20.413
Seeing as I got two in front of me,
I don't think so.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.290
I'm not very observant, am I?

17:24.626 --> 17:27.920
I got a feeling, yeah,
along with a lot of other things.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.881
Why don't we start over?

17:31.133 --> 17:34.260
You know what would look good on you?
Me.

17:37.347 --> 17:38.639
No good?

17:42.644 --> 17:44.979
Have a drink. It's not that bad.

17:47.524 --> 17:49.525
Thank you. Here's to crime.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.658
You're pathetic.

18:00.954 --> 18:02.705
You still want to be a fisherman?

18:02.915 --> 18:05.500
Who told you I wanted to be
a fisherman?

18:05.876 --> 18:07.293
You want to come with me.

18:07.503 --> 18:10.922
I want to come with you,
but I don't want to be a fisherman.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.386
You know, buddy...

18:19.681 --> 18:23.309
...one of these days your mom's
gonna find you a new dad.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.728
I don't want a new dad.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.105
I'm sorry.

18:27.314 --> 18:30.066
Your mom can't sit around
by herself all the time.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.610
She isn't sitting around.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.879
I'm sure he's a good guy.

18:52.965 --> 18:56.384
I know your mom wouldn't take up
with anybody but a good guy.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.848
And you know, buddy...

19:02.558 --> 19:05.768
...the most important thing is
that you and Mommy are happy.

19:07.146 --> 19:10.231
Can we talk about something else now?

19:21.743 --> 19:23.911
I miss you too, buddy.

19:30.085 --> 19:32.461
I miss you so damn much.

19:34.214 --> 19:36.966
What'd you say your name was again?

19:37.551 --> 19:39.594
Irene. Is that so tough?

19:39.761 --> 19:41.470
I'm sorry. Listen.

19:42.931 --> 19:44.974
Could I maybe take you home?

19:45.976 --> 19:46.976
I don't think so.

19:48.103 --> 19:52.315
I came to watch the game. Instead I
got schnockered with Bugsy.

19:54.067 --> 19:56.819
-What does Bugsy stand for anyway?
-Michael.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.822
That's a nice name.
Why don't you use it?

20:00.282 --> 20:01.949
Because people know me as Bugsy.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.996
I'm gonna shove off now.
Big day tomorrow.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.749
I can't take you home?

20:09.958 --> 20:11.626
What, in a wheelbarrow?

20:11.835 --> 20:13.753
Crew guys like you never have cars.

20:13.962 --> 20:16.589
Lay off. I got feelings too.

20:16.798 --> 20:19.717
Where, down in your pants?

20:21.011 --> 20:24.180
Jesus, lady, where's the passion
in your life?

20:24.389 --> 20:26.432
Home in bed.

20:26.683 --> 20:29.060
One of them's 6, the other one's 8.

20:30.729 --> 20:33.898
All I can say is,
there's some lucky kids.

20:34.691 --> 20:36.067
They got a wonderful mother.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.908
You're not messing with me, are you?

20:46.036 --> 20:48.371
Haven't got time.
We're going out in two days.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.375
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Michael.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.294
Gotta go.

20:57.005 --> 20:58.339
What do you mean?

21:00.550 --> 21:02.218
-Where you going?
-Have these.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.095
-Thank you.
-See you.

21:08.016 --> 21:10.142
-Bye, Ethel.
-See you.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.245
Watch your step.

21:39.339 --> 21:41.173
I smell Coppertone.

21:41.383 --> 21:43.342
That means that
Captain Linda Greenlaw...

21:43.552 --> 21:46.804
...a lady vain about her nose,
is in my wheelhouse.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.389
Make that Hawaiian Tropic.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.683
At least I got the nose right.

21:51.810 --> 21:54.478
Your guys are loading bait
and groceries.

21:55.605 --> 21:58.566
-You doing a turnaround?
-No rest for the weary.

21:58.775 --> 22:01.027
There you go.
Flaunting your work ethic.

22:01.361 --> 22:03.529
I don't have a work ethic.
I just have work.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.614
If I'm gonna catch up to you.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.451
I love to watch you study charts.

22:08.660 --> 22:09.952
Why?

22:10.412 --> 22:11.912
You know them all by heart.

22:12.914 --> 22:15.791
What's special about today
that you're blowing smoke up my ass?

22:16.001 --> 22:17.293
I thought I'd make a pass.

22:21.256 --> 22:24.925
You see, I'm looking for a guy
to come home to Maine with me...

22:25.093 --> 22:26.594
...buy a house and raise kids.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.721
What does that guy and you do after?

22:30.223 --> 22:33.476
The thing is, I'm happy.
I'm happy I'm fit to do this.

22:33.685 --> 22:35.811
I just don't see the romance in it.

22:36.063 --> 22:38.939
But you've got it, Captain Greenlaw.

22:39.399 --> 22:41.108
You do. Believe me.

22:41.276 --> 22:43.069
I've seen them come and go.

22:43.278 --> 22:46.781
The day l laid eyes on you, I said,
"She's gonna be a good one."

22:47.407 --> 22:49.283
You can't be good unless you love it.

22:51.828 --> 22:53.621
The fog's just lifting.

22:54.998 --> 22:57.541
You throw off your bow line,
throw off your stern.

22:59.127 --> 23:01.003
You head out the South Channel...

23:01.213 --> 23:04.465
...past Rocky Neck,
Ten Pound Island...

23:05.384 --> 23:08.594
...past Niles Pond,
where l skated as a kid.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.554
Blow your horn...

23:10.764 --> 23:13.808
...and wave to the lighthouse
keeper's kid on Thatcher lsland.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.310
Then the birds show up.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.104
Black-backs...

23:18.355 --> 23:21.232
...herring gulls, big dump ducks.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.568
The sun hits you.

23:24.778 --> 23:27.488
Head north, open up to 12.

23:28.532 --> 23:29.615
You're steaming now.

23:30.492 --> 23:33.452
The guys are busy,
you're in charge.

23:34.746 --> 23:37.998
You know what?
You're a goddamn swordboat captain.

23:41.169 --> 23:43.379
Is there anything better in the world?

23:56.726 --> 23:57.852
Sully.

24:01.064 --> 24:02.898
So what do you think?

24:07.237 --> 24:08.362
You been busy?

24:08.572 --> 24:09.989
Busy enough.

24:10.198 --> 24:12.867
I was working menhaden in Annisquam.

24:13.201 --> 24:15.202
But they laid off Labor Day.

24:15.829 --> 24:17.455
Mended nets over in Fairhaven.

24:17.664 --> 24:20.458
That's crap.
What's this you're doing now?

24:21.877 --> 24:23.210
Helping out a friend.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.879
He paying you?

24:25.464 --> 24:27.047
He's my friend.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.012
Murphy keep his site?

24:36.808 --> 24:38.517
You want this job or not?

24:40.395 --> 24:41.645
I do.

25:47.295 --> 25:50.214
Lord, did l do that?

25:52.759 --> 25:54.134
Yeah, you did.

25:55.220 --> 25:59.098
But I'm not completely blind.
I can still see out of the other one.

26:00.141 --> 26:01.600
Next time I should break a leg.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.478
Then you can stay home
and collect disability.

26:04.896 --> 26:07.690
Think of all those
handicapped parking spaces.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.279
Tell me last night was worth it.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.698
I can't remember.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.909
Can't remember, my ass.

26:19.160 --> 26:21.495
No, I remember your ass.

26:23.707 --> 26:25.583
Last night was worth it.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.919
There's nothing like
sleeping with you.

26:29.963 --> 26:31.380
Just sleeping...

26:31.715 --> 26:33.507
...lying next to you...

26:34.467 --> 26:36.302
...all warm and sweet.

26:37.053 --> 26:39.680
And me wishing the morning
would never come.

26:49.691 --> 26:51.233
Catching up.

26:56.364 --> 26:59.575
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
Look at that shiner.

26:59.784 --> 27:01.243
Come on, Murph, will you?

27:02.787 --> 27:04.872
Good morning.
Where'd you get the mouse?

27:05.081 --> 27:06.999
Chris "Boom-Boom" Cotter.

27:09.669 --> 27:12.588
Put some hair around that hole,
I bet you could hit it.

27:13.632 --> 27:17.384
Not with a pool cue,
or any other pointed instrument.

27:19.804 --> 27:23.682
What do you know except to cut squid
and take them to bed with you?

27:25.935 --> 27:28.646
Ethel, where you getting
your customers these days?

27:28.855 --> 27:30.439
The welfare office?

27:31.149 --> 27:33.400
Who gave you that scar, tough guy?

27:34.319 --> 27:36.153
Back off! Back off.

27:36.363 --> 27:37.488
Come on, swing it.

27:37.864 --> 27:39.281
You assholes!

27:41.576 --> 27:45.829
How you gonna act onboard if you're
already at each other's throats?

27:46.039 --> 27:47.081
All right, Ma.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.834
See you onboard.

27:55.632 --> 27:58.717
-Alfred Pierre, one for the road?
-No, tanks, Mom.

27:59.219 --> 28:02.513
"No, tanks, Mom."
Guy can't even speak good English.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.848
Well, anyway, can I get you anything?

28:05.058 --> 28:06.392
Let's go, boys.

28:08.311 --> 28:10.604
I'll wait for you in the car, Bobby.

28:12.315 --> 28:15.442
Catch fish, boys. Lots of them.
Full ahead.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.736
Hold down the fort, Quentin.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.279
Thanks, Q.

28:19.864 --> 28:20.989
Thanks, Ethel.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.412
Gotta go, Mom.

28:28.915 --> 28:30.666
The Grand Banks.

28:31.334 --> 28:32.584
I know.

28:32.794 --> 28:36.088
Grand Banks are no joke in October.
All right?

28:39.426 --> 28:40.759
Be careful.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.842
At least we'll get cancer together.

29:27.348 --> 29:29.516
I can't put it off any longer.

29:30.393 --> 29:32.478
I'm not too big on goodbyes.

29:35.148 --> 29:38.859
Don't go, Bobby. I got a bad feeling.

29:40.361 --> 29:41.987
I've been thinking about it.

29:42.655 --> 29:45.032
Then for God's sake, don't go.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.201
I'll moonlight, l'll sell the car.

29:47.368 --> 29:49.411
We'll work nights, weekends.

29:49.621 --> 29:53.081
Whatever it takes, little by little,
we'll put something away.

29:59.422 --> 30:00.881
I gotta go.

30:09.974 --> 30:11.225
Michael.

30:28.368 --> 30:31.328
-Irene.
-Irene. I knew that.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.334
I just wanted to say goodbye.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.171
No one ever said goodbye to me before.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.221
Well, goodbye, Irene.

30:49.681 --> 30:50.681
Goodbye.

30:50.849 --> 30:54.059
I wish it were night so l could say,
"Good night, Irene."

30:56.604 --> 30:57.938
That'll come later.

31:02.402 --> 31:03.652
Well, you gotta go.

31:04.445 --> 31:06.405
Come on, boys. Let's go.

31:19.294 --> 31:20.669
I love you.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.630
I will always love you, Christina.

33:03.564 --> 33:06.566
Pack it in there good.
We got more coming down.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.111
Did we get all them eggs up there?

33:20.707 --> 33:22.582
<i>We catching some fish</i>

33:24.043 --> 33:25.752
Is that gonna crap out again?

33:25.920 --> 33:27.212
Never!

34:04.834 --> 34:06.126
Do you mind?

34:09.922 --> 34:12.132
Stinks in here, doesn't it?

34:12.967 --> 34:14.592
Not anymore.

34:26.563 --> 34:29.815
<i>Hi, Bobby:</i>
<i>You're somewhere out there...</i>

34:30.234 --> 34:33.195
<i>...on the deep blue, goddamn sea...</i>

34:33.821 --> 34:37.532
<i>...and I'm writing this on a box</i>
<i>of two semi-down pillows...</i>

34:37.742 --> 34:40.494
<i>...that I secretly bought for us</i>
<i>at Penney's.</i>

34:41.411 --> 34:43.621
<i>And I'm smiling to myself because...</i>

34:43.831 --> 34:46.248
<i>...of the surprise I have</i>
<i>in store for you.</i>

34:46.958 --> 34:51.588
<i>I'm talking removal from our dungeon</i>
<i>in the Crow's Nest...</i>

34:52.422 --> 34:54.591
<i>...to our own place.</i>

34:56.302 --> 34:58.512
<i>It's no great shakes...</i>

34:58.721 --> 35:01.765
<i>...but you gotta begin</i>
<i>with a baby shake, right?</i>

35:04.310 --> 35:06.186
<i>Forever love, Bobby.</i>

35:06.687 --> 35:09.022
<i>I'm in this for the long run.</i>

35:13.861 --> 35:16.947
-I'm not intruding, am I?
-You're not intruding.

35:17.448 --> 35:19.032
You're a natural.

35:19.492 --> 35:21.409
You've got some old salt
in your blood.

35:21.619 --> 35:22.702
Thanks.

35:25.289 --> 35:27.874
You're a happy man out here,
aren't you?

35:28.084 --> 35:29.543
Today, maybe.

35:30.294 --> 35:31.753
When do you get unhappy?

35:32.088 --> 35:33.630
The day we go home.

35:34.048 --> 35:36.466
Home? l thought the sea
was your home.

35:39.303 --> 35:40.387
You got me there.

35:42.765 --> 35:45.267
But if you were gonna pin me down...

35:46.769 --> 35:50.063
...I guess Pensacola, Florida is home.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.107
My ex lives there. Jodi.

35:52.316 --> 35:53.859
And my kids.

35:56.154 --> 36:00.198
I wasn't very good at doing things
the way they're supposed to be done.

36:00.408 --> 36:01.616
Wife.

36:02.618 --> 36:03.869
Kids.

36:04.287 --> 36:06.246
A house with things in it.
All that stuff.

36:06.914 --> 36:08.373
So why are you so happy?

36:09.458 --> 36:11.418
You just got me on a good day.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.379
I'm doing what I was made to do.

36:15.131 --> 36:17.757
And l got a feeling I'll do it
even better this time.

36:19.760 --> 36:20.927
How about you?

36:22.638 --> 36:25.557
I got a woman I can't stand to be
more than two feet away from.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.601
Congratulations.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.230
Then again, l love to fish.

36:37.111 --> 36:38.945
Son, you've got a problem.

36:39.447 --> 36:40.697
I know.

36:56.589 --> 36:57.797
Here you are.

37:06.265 --> 37:10.060
What do you think? Blue skies,
scattered showers, same old, same old?

37:10.269 --> 37:12.270
-Your guess is as good as mine.
-Or better.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.813
Watch it.

37:16.984 --> 37:18.818
This doesn't look good.

37:25.117 --> 37:26.952
Looks pretty ugly here too.

37:27.995 --> 37:29.079
Pam.

37:30.539 --> 37:33.959
Tell Bernie I need two graphics:
Bermuda and Sable Island.

37:53.187 --> 37:54.521
Good.

37:55.731 --> 37:57.190
What's our course?

37:57.358 --> 38:00.527
I've been sailing 42 years.
Never plotted a course.

38:01.612 --> 38:03.738
I set the compass, I ride it...

38:03.948 --> 38:06.241
...we'll be in Bermuda in no time.

38:49.618 --> 38:50.744
Let's go fishing.

38:52.621 --> 38:54.539
All right, guys, let's hit it!

38:55.916 --> 39:00.253
1000 hooks in the water before dinner.
I want 40 miles out there.

39:07.636 --> 39:09.846
Three-mile buoy out!

39:10.056 --> 39:11.473
Yeah, baby.

39:20.274 --> 39:21.441
Set.

39:37.541 --> 39:39.292
Okay, Sully, put it out.

39:40.628 --> 39:42.337
Highflyer!

40:09.281 --> 40:10.782
Hey, A.P.

40:12.827 --> 40:14.077
May the force be with us.

40:14.286 --> 40:16.663
Wanna play with lightsticks,
stick them up your ass.

40:16.872 --> 40:17.872
Easy, Murph.

40:18.082 --> 40:20.917
He's dead weight.
He's been screwing around all night.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.502
A juicer and a head.

40:22.711 --> 40:24.003
Cape Ann, bottom shelf.

40:24.213 --> 40:26.881
Yeah, well, your wife
didn't feel that way.

40:32.304 --> 40:34.180
Hey, knock it off!

40:34.348 --> 40:37.851
I'll head for land and the Newfies
will throw you both in jail!

40:38.060 --> 40:39.602
All right, cap.

40:40.354 --> 40:41.479
Give us some lights.

40:44.150 --> 40:45.525
Come on. Jesus.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.402
Shake, you guys.

40:47.945 --> 40:49.154
Shake!

41:00.207 --> 41:02.667
-Just let it go.
-Your day is coming.

41:02.877 --> 41:05.628
Whenever you're ready.
I'll be right up here.

41:05.921 --> 41:08.673
The job ain't hard enough
without this knucklehead.

41:36.243 --> 41:37.410
Let's go.

41:43.083 --> 41:44.876
We're gonna make some money.

41:46.670 --> 41:48.296
Let's go, boys!

41:50.424 --> 41:52.050
Let's go! Come on!

42:10.486 --> 42:11.694
Come on.

42:32.675 --> 42:34.300
Do it, skip, do it.

42:35.177 --> 42:36.427
Make a killing.

42:38.180 --> 42:39.430
One's on.

42:39.723 --> 42:40.807
Fish on.

42:45.271 --> 42:46.688
Have those gaffs ready.

42:46.897 --> 42:49.315
Don't lose him, Murph.
Don't lose him.

42:51.360 --> 42:52.860
Pull him in, Murph.

42:59.326 --> 43:01.744
All right, now, gaff him. Gaff him!

43:09.128 --> 43:10.712
One, two, three!

43:26.979 --> 43:28.104
Pull him in.

43:39.241 --> 43:41.034
Come on, a little bit more.

43:47.249 --> 43:49.042
So what do you think?

43:49.293 --> 43:50.710
Do you think he'll like it?

43:50.878 --> 43:52.545
He'll love it.

43:54.048 --> 43:55.923
Enough to live with me in it?

43:56.925 --> 44:00.178
By now, honey, you know him
much better than I do.

44:02.765 --> 44:04.182
We're gonna make a go of it.

44:08.312 --> 44:10.104
I got confidence in you.

44:11.732 --> 44:13.650
What, are you putting me on?

44:16.528 --> 44:18.404
He's my precious boy.

44:19.448 --> 44:21.324
And you're the woman for him.

44:23.911 --> 44:26.204
That's something I don't joke about.

44:30.042 --> 44:33.044
<i>The activity down near Bermuda</i>
<i>is deepening rapidly.</i>

44:33.253 --> 44:35.421
<i>Given the warm and volatile</i>
<i>Gulf Stream...</i>

44:35.631 --> 44:40.218
<i>...it won't take much to turn</i>
<i>this tropical storm into a hurricane.</i>

44:40.427 --> 44:43.388
<i>This just in, video of Sable Island.</i>

45:31.186 --> 45:35.231
I put so much ground beef and sausage
in this, it weighed out at 20 pounds.

45:35.441 --> 45:37.316
More than most of our fish weigh.

45:37.484 --> 45:39.360
Skipper say anything about us
coming up short?

45:39.570 --> 45:41.112
He's too scared to say.

45:41.321 --> 45:43.322
Skipper don't get scared.

45:43.824 --> 45:45.032
Just disappointed.

45:46.201 --> 45:48.327
You know why this lasagna weighs
20 pounds?

45:49.288 --> 45:51.497
It tasted like you
threw in a shot put.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.585
I once worked a site
with a guy like you.

45:56.336 --> 45:58.296
The guy had a real bad accident.

46:00.174 --> 46:03.301
Can't even keep track of them
with so many accidents at sea.

46:04.678 --> 46:06.679
Tough to get an ambulance too.

46:11.018 --> 46:12.226
Keep it up.

46:15.481 --> 46:17.190
Highflyer!

46:21.945 --> 46:24.363
A.P., give me a hand.

46:25.866 --> 46:28.326
Hey, how about a little hand
over here?

46:28.535 --> 46:30.995
You do your job, l'll do mine.

46:32.873 --> 46:34.457
Come on, guys.

46:36.251 --> 46:37.668
Came out here for nothing.

46:37.878 --> 46:39.921
Keep moving, keep moving.

46:42.216 --> 46:45.218
Come on, Sully, let's get
some bait going here.

47:02.736 --> 47:04.153
It's big.

47:04.363 --> 47:05.822
-Something very big.
-Fish on!

47:06.031 --> 47:07.198
Come on, guys.

47:07.407 --> 47:08.574
Oh, yeah.

47:08.742 --> 47:10.618
Come on. Bring it up.

47:24.424 --> 47:25.424
Bring it up.

47:29.096 --> 47:30.221
Get the gaff!

47:33.225 --> 47:34.600
Get it out of here!

47:34.768 --> 47:37.436
Stick him.
Stick it in his head! Good!

47:44.778 --> 47:46.070
Get him off!

47:47.281 --> 47:48.990
-He's got my leg!
-Hang on!

47:52.953 --> 47:55.872
Kick your foot out! Kick it!
Kick your foot out.

47:56.081 --> 47:57.290
Get back!

48:01.795 --> 48:04.130
All right, come on, get it out!

48:04.339 --> 48:05.381
Get it out of here.

48:06.466 --> 48:08.759
-Pull him back!
-Over the side.

48:10.053 --> 48:11.512
You all right?

48:17.477 --> 48:19.478
You're short a boot, rookie!

48:21.148 --> 48:22.940
Beats a leg, don't it?

48:44.463 --> 48:48.299
Okay, we're getting a reading of winds
over 140 knots sustained.

48:48.508 --> 48:50.635
Looks like a category 5.

49:16.870 --> 49:20.581
"Billy Tyne is no fine wine

49:22.167 --> 49:24.794
He's lost his touch with our long line

49:25.212 --> 49:28.798
Steamed here and there and all about

49:29.841 --> 49:31.550
What's our tally?

49:32.052 --> 49:33.594
We've struck out"

49:39.518 --> 49:42.311
All right, okay.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

49:54.533 --> 49:57.076
Why aren't you downstairs
watching the movie?

49:58.370 --> 50:00.079
One of our three movies?

50:00.789 --> 50:02.415
I know them all by heart.

50:06.086 --> 50:07.503
Skip...

50:08.088 --> 50:10.715
...what are you gonna do
about those sets? They suck.

50:11.341 --> 50:13.092
We ain't doing nothing.

50:14.720 --> 50:16.303
The boys been talking?

50:17.014 --> 50:18.639
About how l lost it?

50:20.100 --> 50:23.769
Billy Tyne's lost it? Gets a little
slow, they'll draw and quarter you.

50:24.896 --> 50:27.023
I just didn't think
you'd go along with it.

50:27.524 --> 50:31.318
I come here because I need the money.
I'm trying for a new start.

50:31.528 --> 50:33.863
Last trip l thought you had
something to offer.

50:34.072 --> 50:36.198
But all in all,
you're just a little punk.

50:37.284 --> 50:41.037
-You promised me a shitload of fish!
-You'll get a shitload of fish.

50:41.246 --> 50:44.623
I've been in bad patches so many times
and came home with so much stock...

50:44.833 --> 50:47.668
...little boys like you had to
pack it on the pier.

50:47.878 --> 50:50.463
I always find the fish! Always!

50:50.672 --> 50:53.674
And l will this time!
So don't fuck with me!

50:55.886 --> 50:57.470
Aye, aye, skip.

51:12.986 --> 51:14.195
Put them closer!

51:14.821 --> 51:18.824
Murph, closer!
Give them a goddamn banquet.

51:18.992 --> 51:20.659
Aye, aye, cap.

51:21.453 --> 51:23.913
You heard him, boys.
Boss ain't happy.

51:24.122 --> 51:25.581
Double-time.

51:27.626 --> 51:28.626
Let's go, Bob.

51:32.464 --> 51:33.589
Sullivan!

51:34.299 --> 51:36.842
I gotta hit you with a fish again
to get you to work?

51:37.010 --> 51:38.385
Lightsticks, now!

51:38.595 --> 51:40.346
Shut up, asshole!

51:40.555 --> 51:42.848
You couldn't bait fish in a barrel!

51:44.101 --> 51:47.061
-Come on.
-See what I got to deal with?

51:47.270 --> 51:48.979
That's a landlubber.
What an idiot!

51:49.189 --> 51:52.191
Come on, Sully.
What are you, a fisherman or a farmer?

51:52.400 --> 51:54.026
Bugs, help him out.

51:54.194 --> 51:56.570
Hurry up, before the captain sees.

51:56.863 --> 52:00.032
Okay, sure, I'll help him out.
What a screwup!

52:00.242 --> 52:03.494
-You're useless, Sully!
-Lay off, Bugs. You never screw up?

52:03.703 --> 52:06.539
You're nothing but a pimple
on the ass of progress.

52:06.706 --> 52:08.749
I've been on a better slab than this.

52:08.959 --> 52:10.584
I've had it with this.

52:19.761 --> 52:21.554
Take it easy.
It was an accident.

52:26.977 --> 52:30.229
You got the easiest job on the boat,
and you manage to screw it up!

52:30.438 --> 52:33.482
Kiss my ass, you little runt.
And you--!

52:35.861 --> 52:36.902
Murph!

52:40.907 --> 52:43.159
Cap, man overboard!

52:52.085 --> 52:53.794
Take the wheel!

53:10.395 --> 53:12.021
Back her down slow.

53:58.693 --> 54:00.236
Come on, Murph.

54:02.614 --> 54:04.240
We've got Murph!

54:13.375 --> 54:14.667
Come on!

54:34.020 --> 54:36.021
You all right? You all right?

54:40.777 --> 54:42.027
Come on, Murph.

54:43.530 --> 54:48.784
Come on.

55:05.760 --> 55:07.553
How was the water, Murph?

55:07.762 --> 55:09.763
Welcome back, Murph!

55:13.184 --> 55:14.184
You did it, Murph.

55:21.151 --> 55:22.276
Hold on a minute.

55:28.491 --> 55:30.451
All right, bend over.

55:32.620 --> 55:33.620
Tetanus.

55:37.208 --> 55:39.084
Who's the hero?

55:39.586 --> 55:41.587
Bobby and Sully.

55:42.839 --> 55:44.089
Sully?

55:49.179 --> 55:52.264
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dale Murphy out of Cortez, Florida.

55:52.432 --> 55:55.934
The only fish the Andrea Gail has
hooked in three days.

55:56.102 --> 55:57.478
How you feeling?

55:57.687 --> 55:58.854
All right.

56:00.273 --> 56:02.900
-Bobby, thank you.
-Don't worry about it.

56:06.196 --> 56:08.447
Sully was the first one to go in.

56:13.787 --> 56:17.206
So I guess you're the big hero here.

56:17.999 --> 56:20.209
Well, you'd have done the same for me.

56:21.544 --> 56:23.212
Isn't that what I'm supposed to say?

56:25.965 --> 56:28.467
Well, you can say what you want...

56:29.386 --> 56:31.637
...but I'm glad you know how to swim.

56:32.305 --> 56:34.056
That's real big of you, Murph.

56:35.975 --> 56:37.476
It's all I can manage now.

56:38.978 --> 56:40.270
All right?

56:41.439 --> 56:42.856
I'll work on it.

56:48.488 --> 56:49.822
Tough guy.

57:00.333 --> 57:03.001
This weather fax just came in.

57:04.838 --> 57:06.964
Edie, have a look at this.

57:08.133 --> 57:11.802
We have got to head in now!
Put it in at Watch Hill!

57:12.011 --> 57:13.762
In this stuff, harbor's too dangerous.

57:13.930 --> 57:14.930
Dangerous?

57:15.098 --> 57:17.182
Dash into shore,
cut across shipping lanes--

57:17.350 --> 57:20.185
This is a hurricane
coming straight at us!

57:20.395 --> 57:23.439
Let me reduce sails, Sandy,
or even go back home.

57:23.648 --> 57:24.690
This is my boat.

57:24.899 --> 57:27.734
We'll ride this thing out.
Not for fun, for safety.

57:27.944 --> 57:31.071
Do what I've always done:
Go with the flow.

57:47.088 --> 57:49.548
Holy shit! Rogue wave!

57:51.009 --> 57:52.342
Look out!

58:07.233 --> 58:08.233
Everybody here?

58:20.246 --> 58:23.415
Captain, the boys would like
to have a word with you.

58:26.628 --> 58:27.961
Take over.

58:48.107 --> 58:50.692
When this meeting's over,
straighten this crap up.

58:51.444 --> 58:53.028
So what's the word?

58:55.198 --> 58:57.950
We're starting to get
an unlucky feeling out here.

58:58.117 --> 59:00.869
Murph going over, the shark,
a rogue wave....

59:01.079 --> 59:02.079
Yeah, what else?

59:03.706 --> 59:07.668
Never mind unlucky.
We're just looking for some fish.

59:08.044 --> 59:11.880
We had slumps before, you and I,
but nothing like this.

59:12.090 --> 59:15.634
You boys look like you got busted
in a brawl in Scollay Square.

59:15.802 --> 59:18.053
That's how we feel.
We want to go home.

59:19.514 --> 59:23.642
You want to go home? You lonely for
that young mama who was all over you?

59:23.810 --> 59:25.852
My girl is none of your business.

59:26.062 --> 59:29.523
But you are. If you don't like it,
get the hell off! All of you.

59:32.860 --> 59:36.446
I look around and all I see are
little boys sitting on their asses...

59:36.656 --> 59:38.740
...too scared to go
and get some pay dirt.

59:38.950 --> 59:42.369
Pay dirt? What are you talking about?
Where the hell is that?

59:42.579 --> 59:43.996
We covered the Grand Banks.

59:44.330 --> 59:47.165
The Grand Banks are west of us.
I'm headed east.

59:48.668 --> 59:49.835
The Flemish Cap.

59:53.089 --> 59:54.715
The Flemish Cap?

59:55.300 --> 59:58.343
Why don't we steam to Portugal
while we're at it?

01:00:03.308 --> 01:00:05.684
So this is the moment of truth.

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:11.064
This is where they separate
the men from the boys.

01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:16.820
How about it?

01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:21.533
-Are you Gloucestermen?
-Yeah.

01:00:21.743 --> 01:00:24.703
But why go all the way
to the Flemish Cap to prove it?

01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:26.913
Tell him, Alfred Pierre.

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:31.043
That's where the fish are.

01:00:34.213 --> 01:00:35.839
Do we have any other choice?

01:00:36.507 --> 01:00:39.092
Yeah. Crawl home, busted.

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:49.394
-All right, skip.
-All right.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:51.897
All right.

01:00:58.237 --> 01:01:02.199
<i>Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie, 6-6-8-1,</i>
<i>do you read me?</i>

01:01:02.408 --> 01:01:06.370
This is Andrea Gail, Whiskey-
Yankee-Charlie, 6-6-8-1. Hey, Linda.

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:11.541
<i>-What's happening?</i>
<i>-Slim to none. Where are you?</i>

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:15.420
Tail of the Banks.
Kicking up something wicked here.

01:01:15.588 --> 01:01:16.922
Made a couple of sets.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:18.173
You doing any good?

01:01:18.383 --> 01:01:22.928
Nine, first set. Twelve--
No, make that a baker's dozen, second.

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:25.222
<i>Got a couple of markers to boot.</i>

01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:28.225
Your hand is so hot,
I can feel the heat from here.

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:32.187
-I've asked you to team up.
<i>-I don't like partners.</i>

01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:33.814
Business-wise, that is.

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:36.858
Okay, okay. What's your position?

01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:39.444
46 north, 48 west.

01:01:39.904 --> 01:01:41.446
You headed for the Flemish Cap?

01:01:41.614 --> 01:01:45.242
<i>The lady knows her coordinates.</i>
<i>Yeah, I'm steaming full-bore.</i>

01:01:45.451 --> 01:01:47.411
The Flemish Cap is
nearly off the charts.

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:49.287
What are you trying to prove?

01:01:49.497 --> 01:01:53.750
We got gale-force coming out
of Bermuda, stuff out of Sable lsland.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.753
<i>As for me, I'm staring here</i>
<i>at solid white chop.</i>

01:01:56.963 --> 01:01:58.630
This could be a triple-header.

01:01:59.006 --> 01:02:01.174
You're behind me.
So is your weather.

01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:04.970
Yeah, but you've gotta go
through it to get back.

01:02:05.763 --> 01:02:07.222
Good point.

01:02:07.432 --> 01:02:10.392
Billy, you won't like this,
but I'm gonna say it anyway:

01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:12.060
You be careful.

01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:13.645
Yes, Mother.

01:02:16.107 --> 01:02:18.483
Why don't we pick this up later?
I'm out.

01:02:38.629 --> 01:02:41.089
-You guys use some company?
-Sure.

01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:43.383
-Coffee?
-Yeah, thanks.

01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:48.346
<i>--in the mid-Atlantic,</i>
<i>moving rapidly northeast...</i>

01:02:48.514 --> 01:02:50.098
<i>...30-foot waves.</i>

01:02:50.308 --> 01:02:51.391
What'd you hear?

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.685
They're out on the Flemish Cap.

01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:56.354
I got it straight from big Bob Brown.

01:02:57.982 --> 01:02:59.149
Yeah.

01:02:59.692 --> 01:03:01.359
The Flemish Cap.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:04.613
I went there, '62.

01:03:05.865 --> 01:03:07.449
Lots of fish.

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:10.368
And lots of weather.

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:12.078
Hurricanes...

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:14.456
...squalls, huge seas.

01:03:14.665 --> 01:03:16.291
You're full of shit, Quentin.

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:19.211
That's right.

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:21.379
I am.

01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:57.726
-Where are you going?
-To point this boat up into the storm.

01:04:57.935 --> 01:04:59.811
And scream for help!

01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:03.773
We lie ahull, beam to the waves,
slip sideways. Standard procedure.

01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:07.819
Forget it, we won't make it!
Missy, get on the radio now!

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:09.571
-We can make it.
-Mayday!

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:12.490
It's sopping wet!
She'll be weeping in the wind. No!

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:15.201
We stay below and ride this thing out.

01:05:15.411 --> 01:05:17.370
Remember, this is my boat!

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.497
This is my life!

01:05:19.665 --> 01:05:20.665
Go, Melissa!

01:05:25.671 --> 01:05:26.755
Mayday!

01:05:26.964 --> 01:05:28.673
Mayday! Mayday!

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:35.805
We're a 32-foot sailing vessel, Mistral.

01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:38.224
Our position is...

01:05:39.852 --> 01:05:41.353
...39.49 north--

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:45.523
Mayday! Mayday!

01:05:47.652 --> 01:05:48.818
Over.

01:06:18.432 --> 01:06:19.432
Hey, cap!

01:06:27.233 --> 01:06:29.067
Ice machine's had it.
It's dead.

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:33.279
-Check the evaporator?
-Yeah.

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:35.824
-Freon?
-Plenty, but nowhere to flow.

01:06:36.283 --> 01:06:37.575
Use some spit and glue.

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:40.245
I did. She's fried, skip.

01:06:40.413 --> 01:06:42.080
I told Brown, get us a new one...

01:06:42.289 --> 01:06:44.666
...but he gets another overhaul,
son of a bitch!

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:50.797
Sorry.

01:06:58.931 --> 01:07:00.598
The ice machine's gone.

01:07:02.601 --> 01:07:04.019
Oh, fuck.

01:07:11.777 --> 01:07:13.945
All right,
we got good ice on them now.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.947
We seal the fish hold.

01:07:16.115 --> 01:07:18.992
With luck, we'll deliver
the catch and set the market.

01:07:20.786 --> 01:07:22.120
Pull up the gear.

01:07:24.248 --> 01:07:25.623
We're going home.

01:07:28.794 --> 01:07:31.588
Put these babies on ice,
and we're out of here!

01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:54.861
<i>We are taking heavy waves.</i>
<i>Damage on deck.</i>

01:07:57.490 --> 01:07:59.616
<i>Need immediate assistance.</i>

01:07:59.825 --> 01:08:03.161
<i>We're beam to the sea</i>
<i>and taking on water.</i>

01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:05.997
Just so you understand
what we're up against.

01:08:06.957 --> 01:08:11.461
We're looking at 40 to 50-foot waves,
gale-force winds. A real bad one.

01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:13.129
Right in our path.

01:08:13.881 --> 01:08:16.299
The Weather Service
isjerking off again.

01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:17.550
No.

01:08:18.676 --> 01:08:20.261
You're afraid?

01:08:20.595 --> 01:08:22.471
I never seen you scared.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:25.892
It's pretty rough stuff out there,
that's for sure.

01:08:27.019 --> 01:08:30.020
We either hang out here
for a few days till it calms down--

01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:31.356
But, cap...

01:08:31.607 --> 01:08:34.234
...we got 60,000 pounds offish here.

01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:36.194
Are we gonna let it spoil?

01:08:36.403 --> 01:08:39.447
I thought we were gonna
set the market, make a killing.

01:08:39.657 --> 01:08:42.367
Or we say the hell with it.

01:08:43.077 --> 01:08:44.993
We drive right through it.

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:55.087
You said we're Gloucestermen.

01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:02.679
What do you say, guys?

01:09:02.888 --> 01:09:04.555
Are we or aren't we?

01:09:05.724 --> 01:09:07.183
We come out here for nothing?

01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:09.727
-It's a lot of money.
-Let's make some money.

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:12.897
Come on. Let's hear it, Gloucester!

01:09:13.941 --> 01:09:17.694
Let's get her lashed down.
Bugs, put the birds in the water.

01:09:17.903 --> 01:09:19.863
Birds in. Got it, skip.

01:09:28.538 --> 01:09:30.247
Look. Look at this.

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:34.711
We got Hurricane Grace moving north
off the Atlantic seaboard.

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:36.546
Huge...

01:09:36.755 --> 01:09:38.840
...getting massive.

01:09:39.049 --> 01:09:42.926
Two, this low south of Sable Island,
ready to explode.

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:45.095
Look at this.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:50.059
Three, a fresh cold front
swooping down from Canada.

01:09:50.769 --> 01:09:52.937
But it's caught a ride
on the jet stream...

01:09:53.147 --> 01:09:55.940
...and is motoring hell-bent
towards the Atlantic.

01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:57.609
Cool.

01:09:57.902 --> 01:09:58.943
Wait, wait.

01:10:00.237 --> 01:10:02.697
What if Hurricane Grace
runs smack into it?

01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:07.535
Add to the scenario this baby off
Sable lsland, scrounging for energy.

01:10:07.786 --> 01:10:11.372
She'll start feeding off
both the Canadian cold front...

01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:13.791
...and Hurricane Grace.

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:18.004
You could be a meteorologist all your life
and never see something like this.

01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:23.635
It would be a disaster
of epic proportions.

01:10:24.386 --> 01:10:25.803
<i>It would be...</i>

01:10:25.971 --> 01:10:27.805
<i>...the perfect storm.</i>

01:10:39.318 --> 01:10:40.485
Let's get down below.

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:42.820
Bobby?

01:10:43.656 --> 01:10:45.240
I want you up here with me.

01:11:00.756 --> 01:11:03.341
Mayday! Mayday!

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:11.683
<i>Sailing vessel Mistral,</i>
<i>this is Coast Guard rescue.</i>

01:11:11.892 --> 01:11:13.101
Sandy!

01:11:15.854 --> 01:11:19.023
Edie, they heard me!
They're coming!

01:11:30.035 --> 01:11:32.036
<i>Air Force rescue 2-3-1.</i>

01:11:32.204 --> 01:11:34.080
We've located the Mistral.

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:36.624
<i>Position: 39.49 north...</i>

01:11:36.834 --> 01:11:39.002
<i>...69.52 west.</i>

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:43.214
How far's that last position?

01:11:43.382 --> 01:11:45.300
About 20.3 miles, captain.

01:11:45.509 --> 01:11:47.427
OD, boatswain on the bridge.

01:11:52.599 --> 01:11:54.142
Tallyho, there they are.

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:02.567
-Okay, guys, showtime.
-You got it.

01:12:03.068 --> 01:12:04.902
Mistral, this is 2-3-1.

01:12:05.112 --> 01:12:08.406
We're gonna extract you
one at a time from the deck.

01:12:08.699 --> 01:12:10.950
Hey, Jeremy, I don't like this.

01:12:11.368 --> 01:12:14.704
-Clock's ticking.
-Come on, we better get them off now.

01:12:14.913 --> 01:12:15.955
Get closer, Darryl.

01:12:16.248 --> 01:12:17.540
Just a little closer.

01:12:22.671 --> 01:12:24.714
Okay, deploying the basket.

01:12:25.758 --> 01:12:27.300
Close to 2:00.

01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:28.760
Let's come right to 5.

01:12:29.428 --> 01:12:31.596
-Four. Three.
-Son of a bitch.

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:33.681
Stop there. Hold your hover.

01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:35.099
Goddamn it!

01:12:35.309 --> 01:12:37.685
Keep it steady, keep it steady.

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:40.646
Shit!

01:12:47.237 --> 01:12:48.696
Man out!

01:12:49.281 --> 01:12:51.491
-Shear the cable!
-No, I got it!

01:13:09.093 --> 01:13:10.093
Shit.

01:13:10.302 --> 01:13:11.844
Bring up the basket!

01:13:15.474 --> 01:13:16.766
Sandy!

01:13:17.643 --> 01:13:18.935
Hold on!

01:13:19.144 --> 01:13:20.436
I got you!

01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:23.231
-Basket's in.
-Looks like I'm going for a swim.

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:24.607
Okay, go get them.

01:13:24.817 --> 01:13:26.484
Mitchell off intercom.

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:28.945
It's time to get wet.

01:13:31.198 --> 01:13:33.324
We're gonna be all right.

01:13:34.952 --> 01:13:35.952
Go.

01:14:11.572 --> 01:14:12.572
Altitude.

01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:15.867
Altitude. Get her up, get her up!

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:22.748
He's in the water.

01:14:26.670 --> 01:14:28.296
I'm going after him!

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:29.881
No, no, wait! Stand by!

01:14:32.176 --> 01:14:33.676
Jonesy, hold on.

01:14:42.644 --> 01:14:43.895
There! He's okay.

01:14:44.396 --> 01:14:47.231
This isn't working.
They'll have to get in the water.

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:00.578
Come on, come on!

01:15:01.455 --> 01:15:02.997
You're having a blast, huh?

01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:06.459
-Want a turn?
-No, just watch. I want to watch.

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:09.462
I'm studying up for the day
I get my own boat.

01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:11.464
Your own boat, huh?

01:15:11.673 --> 01:15:14.133
Want to give me a hand?
Grab the throttle.

01:15:16.929 --> 01:15:18.262
Hang on.

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:23.226
-Ah, shit!
-Seven K, six easy.

01:15:23.435 --> 01:15:24.977
-Eight minimum.
-Ten.

01:15:25.479 --> 01:15:28.773
You know, I'm gonna get me
a new used Ford F-150...

01:15:28.982 --> 01:15:31.025
...take a ride to Digby with lrene.

01:15:31.235 --> 01:15:35.446
Going to get drunk, eat like a pig
and sleep like a child!

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:37.073
Fish and fun-gee!

01:15:40.452 --> 01:15:44.789
Okay, Jer, too risky to go lower.
You gotta jump from here.

01:16:01.139 --> 01:16:04.642
Good afternoon, madam.
I'm Sergeant Jeremy Mitchell.

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:07.144
I'll be your para-rescue jumper today.

01:16:07.479 --> 01:16:08.980
How are you?

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:10.773
Okay so far.

01:16:26.665 --> 01:16:29.709
Keep your hands
and feet in the basket.

01:16:33.839 --> 01:16:35.131
-Careful.
-Okay!

01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:37.008
All right, here we go.

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:45.266
You're next.

01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:58.654
That was nothing!

01:16:59.114 --> 01:17:00.197
Come on!

01:17:14.546 --> 01:17:16.088
Oh, my God.

01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:18.507
It's happening.

01:17:56.254 --> 01:17:59.423
<i>Andrea Gail, Andrea Gail.</i>
<i>This is Hannah Boden.</i>

01:18:04.012 --> 01:18:05.221
--Billy, over.

01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:08.099
Calling the Andrea Gail.

01:18:14.606 --> 01:18:16.941
<i>Andrea Gail, do you read me?</i>

01:18:17.150 --> 01:18:19.402
Do you read me? Come in!

01:18:19.611 --> 01:18:23.698
Come in, for God's sake, come in!
Billy, these storms have collided!

01:18:23.907 --> 01:18:25.324
They are exploding!

01:18:27.786 --> 01:18:29.078
Who is it?

01:18:29.579 --> 01:18:30.579
I don't know.

01:18:30.789 --> 01:18:32.581
<i>Andrea Gail, come in!</i>

01:18:33.834 --> 01:18:36.961
Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1, over.

01:18:37.170 --> 01:18:38.671
Talk to me, Billy, over.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:41.257
I repeat,
Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1--

01:18:43.427 --> 01:18:45.845
Look at your fax, damn it!
Look at your fax!

01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:49.140
Whiskey-Yankee-Charlie 6-6-8-1, over!

01:18:49.349 --> 01:18:51.809
<i>-Where are you, Billy?</i>
-Linda?

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:53.185
Give me the coordinates.

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:56.564
-44 north, 56.4 west.
-We're 44 north...

01:18:56.773 --> 01:18:59.483
<i>...56.4 west, headed west.</i>

01:18:59.985 --> 01:19:04.905
<i>I repeat, 44 north,</i>
<i>56.4 west, headed--</i>

01:19:05.782 --> 01:19:07.408
<i>Over.</i>

01:19:07.617 --> 01:19:10.161
Billy, get out of there.

01:19:10.662 --> 01:19:14.039
Come about! Let it carry you out!
What the hell are you doing?

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:15.332
Hang on!

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:20.379
Billy! Billy, for chrissake!

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:24.175
You're steaming into a bomb!
Turn around, for chrissake!

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:27.678
It's the antenna.

01:19:27.888 --> 01:19:30.139
Billy, can you hear me?

01:19:30.474 --> 01:19:34.059
You're headed right
for the middle of the monster.

01:19:43.695 --> 01:19:45.529
Oh, my God.

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:55.539
Hang on!

01:19:57.209 --> 01:19:58.459
Take the wheel.

01:19:58.919 --> 01:20:00.336
No, I'll go.

01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:04.215
Mayday, mayday, mayday...

01:20:04.424 --> 01:20:06.175
...Coast Guard Boston.

01:20:07.052 --> 01:20:10.137
This is fishing vessel Hannah Boden
relaying a mayday...

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:12.556
<i>...for swordboat Andrea Gail.</i>

01:20:12.849 --> 01:20:15.893
Last position, 44 north...

01:20:16.269 --> 01:20:19.688
...56.4 west, over.

01:20:20.732 --> 01:20:25.027
<i>Advise you proceed to next incident</i>
<i>at your discretion, over.</i>

01:20:25.237 --> 01:20:27.029
Yeah, roger, Boston.

01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:30.115
I just got a mayday on a Gloucester
swordboat, the Andrea Gail.

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:34.787
44 north, 56.4 west, headed west.

01:20:35.205 --> 01:20:37.706
Jesus. That's straight into hell.

01:20:37.958 --> 01:20:40.876
Gloucester.
They're always from Gloucester.

01:20:41.086 --> 01:20:44.797
It's an increased-risk mission,
so, you know, it's up to us.

01:20:45.006 --> 01:20:47.174
I'm getting
a little air-to-air feeling.

01:20:47.384 --> 01:20:49.343
Refuel in hell?
That's pretty sporty.

01:20:49.761 --> 01:20:51.720
Call the cutter.
We're coming in hot.

01:20:52.097 --> 01:20:54.974
People, slight change of plans!

01:20:55.433 --> 01:20:58.394
We're gonna drop you on
the Coast Guard cutter Tamaroa.

01:20:58.603 --> 01:21:01.689
We got some swordfishermen
who have lost their way.

01:21:03.275 --> 01:21:04.817
Or their minds.

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:48.152
<i>This is rescue 2-3-1</i>
<i>on final approach.</i>

01:21:48.361 --> 01:21:52.114
<i>Rescue 2-3-1, flight deck is green.</i>

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:55.200
There it is.
You're being waved in.

01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:57.036
Thirty meters and closing.

01:21:57.245 --> 01:21:59.663
Twenty-five meters, winds 43.

01:21:59.831 --> 01:22:02.082
Set a line at 0-1-0.

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:04.960
Beautiful. We're coming.

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:06.378
Watch this wave, cap.

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:08.589
<i>2-3-1, looking good.</i>
<i>Transfer at will.</i>

01:22:08.798 --> 01:22:09.924
Drop ladder.

01:22:13.136 --> 01:22:14.803
All right, send them down.

01:22:15.013 --> 01:22:16.180
Put your foot out.

01:22:16.723 --> 01:22:17.723
Left leg out.

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:19.850
Mind your helm, goddamn it.

01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:23.771
Watch the deck!

01:22:24.898 --> 01:22:26.148
Come on.

01:22:27.025 --> 01:22:28.776
First survivor on deck.

01:22:28.985 --> 01:22:32.529
-Where's our fuel?
-Refueling tanker is on the way.

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:35.532
<i>Second survivor on deck.</i>

01:22:35.825 --> 01:22:37.034
Jesus.

01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:38.429
It's gone.

01:23:40.932 --> 01:23:44.601
No antenna, no radio.
We're back in the 19th century.

01:23:48.606 --> 01:23:50.482
You want to call it quits,
turn around?

01:23:51.776 --> 01:23:52.776
What do you think?

01:23:54.738 --> 01:23:56.196
I think she's a hell of a boat.

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:58.032
With a hell of a crew.

01:23:58.366 --> 01:23:59.700
And a hell of a skipper.

01:24:04.497 --> 01:24:06.457
All right then, Gloucester...

01:24:06.666 --> 01:24:08.083
...we're coming home!

01:24:28.313 --> 01:24:29.563
Take the wheel!

01:24:30.148 --> 01:24:31.148
Skipper, don't!

01:24:31.316 --> 01:24:34.359
Take the goddamn wheel!
That's an order!

01:24:45.121 --> 01:24:46.955
Damn, I can't see anything.

01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:55.380
What's the gauge say?

01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:59.343
It's low, Jonesy.
Where are they?

01:24:59.552 --> 01:25:02.513
-Tanker's on the way.
-How many stops are they making?

01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:06.350
No!

01:25:08.353 --> 01:25:10.479
Come on! Not again.

01:25:11.022 --> 01:25:13.357
Hello? Ethel, thank God!

01:25:13.525 --> 01:25:17.194
I'm going crazy here.
Even the weather guy's gone bananas.

01:25:17.362 --> 01:25:20.364
Have you heard from--?
Hello? Ethel?

01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:22.616
Shit!

01:25:45.932 --> 01:25:48.058
There she is! Thank God.

01:25:48.268 --> 01:25:51.353
Let's fill her up, save these yahoos
and get out of here.

01:25:51.729 --> 01:25:53.814
King 1-2, we have visual.

01:25:54.065 --> 01:25:57.943
Air Force rescue 2-3-1,
you've got a wet hose.

01:26:50.413 --> 01:26:52.956
All right now, hold on!

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:11.099
In the water!

01:27:11.851 --> 01:27:13.352
Hold on, skip!

01:28:01.985 --> 01:28:03.360
Shit.

01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:29.594
Come on, skip!

01:28:33.391 --> 01:28:35.767
Come on, skip, come on!

01:29:03.755 --> 01:29:04.755
Yeah!

01:29:12.722 --> 01:29:14.097
Anything yet?

01:29:14.307 --> 01:29:15.432
Nothing about boats.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:18.101
-I got four nines.
-He's a liar.

01:29:18.269 --> 01:29:19.478
Florence.

01:29:21.814 --> 01:29:24.107
<i>Damage estimates</i>
<i>are in the high millions.</i>

01:29:24.317 --> 01:29:26.026
<i>Folks, the worst is yet to come.</i>

01:29:26.235 --> 01:29:28.028
<i>The storm of the century.</i>

01:29:28.237 --> 01:29:31.323
<i>Residents, stay inside,</i>
<i>pack sandbags against door frames.</i>

01:29:31.532 --> 01:29:35.160
<i>A report here that Cape Ann</i>
<i>fishing industry is in tatters.</i>

01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:38.497
<i>Lobstermen from Gloucester to Scituate</i>
<i>have lost their traps.</i>

01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:43.085
<i>A missing swordboat, Andrea Gail,</i>
<i>out of Gloucester with a crew of six.</i>

01:29:43.294 --> 01:29:46.546
<i>An Air National Guard rescue</i>
<i>helicopter has been dispatched.</i>

01:29:46.756 --> 01:29:50.175
<i>At Logan International Airport,</i>
<i>floooed runways.</i>

01:29:58.726 --> 01:29:59.976
We did it!

01:30:09.028 --> 01:30:11.530
-Get those windows boarded up!
-All right, skip.

01:30:11.739 --> 01:30:13.490
Come on, board it up!

01:30:18.496 --> 01:30:21.581
Tell those guys forget it.
We'll get our gas somewhere else.

01:30:34.512 --> 01:30:35.595
What do you think?

01:30:43.187 --> 01:30:44.771
We're running on fumes.

01:30:47.275 --> 01:30:49.025
King 1-2, this isn't gonna work.

01:30:50.319 --> 01:30:52.070
<i>This is not our night.</i>

01:30:54.365 --> 01:30:58.535
We're issuing a mayday.
Give the Coast Guard our coordinates.

01:31:00.204 --> 01:31:01.663
We're ditching.

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:13.508
Mayday, mayday, Air Force rescue 2-3-1
calling Coast Guard Tamaroa.

01:31:14.343 --> 01:31:16.928
King 1-2, departing the area.

01:31:21.100 --> 01:31:22.225
Come on!

01:31:22.518 --> 01:31:24.019
Let's get it up!

01:31:29.859 --> 01:31:31.735
All right, guys, get ready!

01:31:33.321 --> 01:31:34.571
Hold on!

01:31:34.906 --> 01:31:36.406
Get it up there!

01:31:39.827 --> 01:31:41.036
Get another one.

01:31:41.245 --> 01:31:42.329
Come on.

01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:53.882
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Grab them, grab them!

01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:58.220
Hang on, there's a swell!

01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:10.440
Come on, guys, try to get you close.

01:32:10.608 --> 01:32:12.734
-Stay together.
-Roger that.

01:32:18.282 --> 01:32:19.366
Number 1 is out!

01:32:21.077 --> 01:32:22.410
Bail! Bail out!

01:32:22.787 --> 01:32:25.872
-Leave yourself enough time, okay?
-I'll be fine.

01:32:37.051 --> 01:32:38.301
Go, Jonesy, go!

01:32:42.557 --> 01:32:44.140
You're next.

01:32:47.645 --> 01:32:49.145
Hold on, hold on!

01:33:00.825 --> 01:33:02.534
Now, Jeremy, now!
Go! Bail out!

01:33:02.868 --> 01:33:04.411
See you, Darryl.

01:33:16.882 --> 01:33:19.301
No, no, no, no. No!

01:34:32.875 --> 01:34:34.376
Over here!

01:34:34.585 --> 01:34:37.545
We're over here!

01:34:50.768 --> 01:34:52.227
Have you seen Mitchell?

01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:54.229
No.

01:34:54.438 --> 01:34:55.647
What about Jonesy?

01:34:56.857 --> 01:34:58.149
Nothing. Just you.

01:34:59.443 --> 01:35:01.569
Goddamn it, we don't lose anybody!

01:35:07.952 --> 01:35:09.619
Come on, lay it on.

01:35:10.413 --> 01:35:12.163
-Get it locked!
-Get them on!

01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:23.049
They're not gonna make it!

01:35:23.259 --> 01:35:25.218
Tell them to hold on.
I'll turn the boat.

01:35:30.725 --> 01:35:32.058
Right now, let's go!

01:35:37.523 --> 01:35:39.482
Come on, guys, you can do it!

01:35:39.650 --> 01:35:41.776
It's jammed! It's jammed!

01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:47.240
Lock it down!

01:35:56.625 --> 01:35:57.917
I can't hold her!

01:36:05.050 --> 01:36:06.342
Come on, get it up.

01:36:06.802 --> 01:36:08.011
Put it on now!

01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:09.679
Come on, this is it.

01:36:11.015 --> 01:36:12.891
-Get it on.
-I'm trying!

01:36:13.058 --> 01:36:14.058
Get it on.

01:36:20.357 --> 01:36:21.816
It's loose. I got it!

01:36:29.116 --> 01:36:30.116
Man overboard!

01:36:30.785 --> 01:36:32.744
-What?!
-Two over the side.

01:36:37.708 --> 01:36:39.626
Come on, help me!

01:36:39.835 --> 01:36:40.960
Hold on, I got you!

01:36:44.048 --> 01:36:45.465
Grab the line!

01:36:57.978 --> 01:36:59.312
Oh, God.

01:36:59.939 --> 01:37:01.815
We lost Bugsy!

01:37:11.617 --> 01:37:12.617
Bugsy!

01:37:34.098 --> 01:37:35.849
Hold on. Grab this.

01:37:45.067 --> 01:37:46.442
Hold on!

01:37:49.864 --> 01:37:52.323
Come on, Bugsy. Grab it!

01:37:59.123 --> 01:38:00.123
Grab it!

01:38:02.042 --> 01:38:03.042
Bugsy!

01:38:36.535 --> 01:38:38.161
There! Right there!

01:38:38.329 --> 01:38:40.330
Come on, let's go!

01:38:55.679 --> 01:38:58.556
I'm here, Jeremy, l'm here.
I got you. We're here.

01:38:59.558 --> 01:39:01.893
Hey, talk to me, J. Talk to me.

01:39:02.102 --> 01:39:04.687
I'm all busted up, cap.

01:39:05.022 --> 01:39:06.606
Can't breathe.

01:39:06.815 --> 01:39:10.485
-Hey, Mitch, have you seen Jonesy?
-No.

01:39:10.694 --> 01:39:13.696
Go find him. Go find Jonesy.
Go get him.

01:39:54.154 --> 01:39:55.780
Boys, that's it.

01:39:57.324 --> 01:39:58.616
We can't make it.

01:40:04.999 --> 01:40:06.541
We're turning around.

01:40:11.338 --> 01:40:13.214
Come on, cap, we can do it.

01:40:13.882 --> 01:40:15.383
What about our catch?

01:40:16.093 --> 01:40:17.635
We'll mug them next time.

01:40:20.014 --> 01:40:21.681
This piece of water belongs to us.

01:40:23.058 --> 01:40:25.768
The fish will gather again
<i>for the Andrea Gail...</i>

01:40:29.690 --> 01:40:30.690
...when we come back.

01:40:32.776 --> 01:40:35.153
This is gonna be
the turnaround of all time.

01:40:36.613 --> 01:40:37.947
Textbook.

01:40:39.074 --> 01:40:40.742
So get ready.

01:41:13.442 --> 01:41:16.069
If it were good news,
he would've called us.

01:41:17.571 --> 01:41:21.324
The news is the rescue helicopter
had to ditch.

01:41:21.533 --> 01:41:23.910
We can't raise the Andrea Gail.

01:41:26.163 --> 01:41:27.288
What does that mean?

01:41:27.998 --> 01:41:29.665
We don't know anything.

01:41:30.209 --> 01:41:34.003
If anyone can survive this storm,
it's Billy Tyne. I'll give him that.

01:41:34.213 --> 01:41:35.671
What do you want?

01:41:36.215 --> 01:41:39.133
Credit for having the guts
to walk in here?

01:41:39.301 --> 01:41:40.301
I do.

01:41:41.011 --> 01:41:42.637
Give it to him.

01:41:43.514 --> 01:41:45.181
How you doing, Quentin?

01:41:45.349 --> 01:41:47.016
Pretty good, governor.

01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:49.852
You're counting your money.

01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:54.690
And my guy is out there risking
his life for a bunch of stupid fish.

01:41:55.234 --> 01:41:56.275
That's the game.

01:41:57.486 --> 01:42:01.489
I hate the game.
I hate the goddamn game!

01:42:01.698 --> 01:42:02.698
Do you hear me?!

01:42:02.908 --> 01:42:05.868
Do you read me, governor?
Do you?!

01:42:06.078 --> 01:42:07.787
Do you read me?!

01:42:15.921 --> 01:42:17.588
Did you see him?

01:42:17.798 --> 01:42:19.507
I don't see anything!

01:42:23.929 --> 01:42:26.556
Look! There's the cutter.

01:42:34.898 --> 01:42:37.900
-Have them put out the cargo net.
-Cargo net, aye, sir.

01:42:39.278 --> 01:42:40.903
Put me alongside them.

01:42:41.655 --> 01:42:45.241
I want five men on that net.
And get the light out there.

01:42:45.409 --> 01:42:47.076
Okay, guys, hook in!

01:42:49.746 --> 01:42:51.080
Pick it up! Move!

01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:53.166
Keep your light on those swimmers!

01:42:53.375 --> 01:42:54.542
Get ready!

01:42:55.752 --> 01:42:58.004
Release the net now!

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:01.424
Okay, now, Jeremy, swim!

01:43:02.009 --> 01:43:03.759
Swim!

01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:16.689
Give him a hand!

01:43:16.899 --> 01:43:19.150
Get ready!

01:43:19.359 --> 01:43:20.818
Come on!

01:43:52.976 --> 01:43:55.937
All right! Let's do it again.

01:43:56.146 --> 01:43:58.481
If they can't get to us,
we'll get to them.

01:43:58.690 --> 01:44:00.858
Go up swell and drift down.

01:44:01.068 --> 01:44:02.610
Broadside, captain?

01:44:02.819 --> 01:44:05.154
Isn't it too dangerous?
It's too hairy.

01:44:05.364 --> 01:44:06.989
I won't let two men drown!

01:44:10.244 --> 01:44:12.870
Hold on, Jer. Just hold on.

01:44:24.883 --> 01:44:27.301
When I say now, you go full throttle.
Got it?

01:44:31.348 --> 01:44:33.349
We only get one chance at this.

01:44:34.851 --> 01:44:35.851
And then?

01:44:37.771 --> 01:44:38.896
We pray.

01:44:56.581 --> 01:45:14.181
Wait.

01:45:25.652 --> 01:45:26.944
Now!

01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:38.080
Faster!

01:46:54.491 --> 01:46:55.908
We did it!

01:46:57.494 --> 01:46:58.661
Guys, we're alive!

01:46:59.204 --> 01:47:01.664
We made the turn! We did it!

01:47:06.086 --> 01:47:08.712
Hey, skip, l'm giving you notice.

01:47:08.922 --> 01:47:10.131
This is my last trip.

01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:13.884
When we get back, I'm going right to
Salisbury Beach with Chris.

01:47:14.094 --> 01:47:16.887
We're riding those go-carts,
full-time.

01:47:20.308 --> 01:47:21.934
What do you think, skip?

01:47:22.352 --> 01:47:24.311
We're doing 12 knots.

01:47:24.688 --> 01:47:28.065
We keep this up,
make it through till dawn...

01:47:28.859 --> 01:47:30.526
...we might get out of here.

01:47:38.452 --> 01:47:40.035
They're coming around, Jeremy.

01:47:40.203 --> 01:47:43.038
I can't make it, cap.
They're coming for you.

01:47:43.206 --> 01:47:44.874
You're wrong, Jer!

01:47:45.083 --> 01:47:46.417
They're coming for us.

01:47:47.210 --> 01:47:49.587
I'm not gonna leave you here, Jer.

01:47:50.672 --> 01:47:54.133
You have just one chance to
grab ahold of those nets.

01:47:54.342 --> 01:47:56.260
-You roger that?
-Okay.

01:48:04.269 --> 01:48:06.395
-Back full!
-Back full on!

01:48:17.115 --> 01:48:19.617
You gotta swim now, Jer!

01:48:30.378 --> 01:48:32.546
Grab it, Jer, just grab it!

01:48:48.939 --> 01:48:50.105
Come on!

01:49:00.283 --> 01:49:01.742
Climb! Climb!

01:49:02.744 --> 01:49:03.744
Reach!

01:49:10.460 --> 01:49:12.294
We lost one! Pick up the net!

01:49:14.548 --> 01:49:17.716
Come on! Give me your hand!

01:49:28.103 --> 01:49:32.773
Reach and grab it with everything
you got. Everything you've got!

01:49:39.030 --> 01:49:40.364
Hold on!

01:49:42.325 --> 01:49:43.909
Pull!

01:49:48.081 --> 01:49:51.166
Yes! Get them inside
and clear this deck.

01:49:56.131 --> 01:49:57.798
All right, let's go.

01:49:59.593 --> 01:50:02.845
There's another man out there!
There's another man!

01:50:03.013 --> 01:50:07.516
Jonesy!

01:51:10.246 --> 01:51:11.997
Skip, we're gonna make it.

01:51:52.872 --> 01:51:54.915
She's not gonna let us out.

01:52:21.526 --> 01:52:22.651
No.

01:52:31.619 --> 01:52:33.996
Come on, you bitch!

01:52:41.171 --> 01:52:55.058
Come on!

01:53:39.103 --> 01:53:41.271
Come on. We gotta get out.

01:53:44.818 --> 01:53:46.401
How do we do this, skip?

01:53:46.694 --> 01:53:48.362
No school for it.

01:53:48.571 --> 01:53:49.738
Never was.

01:54:13.263 --> 01:54:15.514
This is gonna be hard
on my little boy.

01:54:32.615 --> 01:54:33.615
Bobby...

01:54:34.993 --> 01:54:36.869
...I'm sorry I got you into this.

01:54:38.955 --> 01:54:41.123
Skip, we made the right call.

01:54:41.791 --> 01:54:43.250
We had to try.

01:54:44.878 --> 01:54:46.420
We were so close.

01:54:52.635 --> 01:54:55.220
It was a hell of a fight, though, huh?

01:55:05.106 --> 01:55:06.982
Let's get out of here, huh?

01:56:18.596 --> 01:56:20.097
<i>Christina.</i>

01:56:21.182 --> 01:56:23.183
<i>Christina, can you hear me?</i>

01:56:24.727 --> 01:56:27.813
<i>I don't know if you can,</i>
<i>but I'm talking to you, baby.</i>

01:56:29.565 --> 01:56:31.733
<i>Do you know how much I love you?</i>

01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:34.695
<i>I loved you the moment I saw you.</i>

01:56:35.279 --> 01:56:36.613
<i>I love you now...</i>

01:56:37.657 --> 01:56:39.449
<i>...and I'll love you forever.</i>

01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:42.285
<i>No goodbye.</i>

01:56:43.496 --> 01:56:45.664
<i>There's only love, Christina.</i>

01:56:46.666 --> 01:56:48.083
<i>Only love.</i>

01:57:19.866 --> 01:57:22.743
<i>It's been a week of round-the-clock</i>
<i>flights involving...</i>

01:57:22.952 --> 01:57:26.079
<i>...efforts of half a dozen Northeast</i>
<i>air rescue stations.</i>

01:57:26.289 --> 01:57:30.292
<i>However, as of this hour, the Coast</i>
<i>Guard has suspended its search...</i>

01:57:30.460 --> 01:57:34.087
<i>...for Air National Guard</i>
<i>para-rescue jumper Millard Jones.</i>

01:57:34.297 --> 01:57:36.465
<i>He leaves a wife and three daughters.</i>

01:57:36.674 --> 01:57:39.342
The search for the Andrea Gail
<i>out of Gloucester...</i>

01:57:39.552 --> 01:57:42.763
<i>...has also been suspended</i>
<i>after aircrafts covered...</i>

01:57:42.972 --> 01:57:45.807
<i>...116,000 square miles of ocean...</i>

01:57:46.017 --> 01:57:48.518
<i>...without finding a single survivor.</i>

01:57:48.728 --> 01:57:51.480
<i>We'll have more news</i>
<i>after these messages.</i>

01:58:46.536 --> 01:58:48.370
I knew Billy Tyne.

01:58:49.497 --> 01:58:52.207
I did not know his crew very well.

01:58:53.042 --> 01:58:57.129
But any man who sailed with him
must've been the better for it.

01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:00.423
Robert Shatford...

01:59:01.217 --> 01:59:02.759
...Dale Murphy...

01:59:03.511 --> 01:59:05.095
...Michael Moran...

01:59:05.888 --> 01:59:07.556
...David Sullivan...

01:59:08.307 --> 01:59:09.933
...Alfred Pierre...

01:59:11.435 --> 01:59:14.020
...may you rest easy, long-liners...

01:59:14.730 --> 01:59:17.941
...in fair winds and calm seas.

01:59:22.071 --> 01:59:23.989
For those of us left behind...

01:59:24.198 --> 01:59:27.284
...the unmarked grave which is
home for those lost at sea...

01:59:27.493 --> 01:59:29.244
...is of no consolation.

01:59:30.538 --> 01:59:32.289
It can't be visited.

01:59:32.748 --> 01:59:36.376
There is no headstone on which
to rest a bunch of flowers.

01:59:36.752 --> 01:59:39.337
The only place we can revisit them...

01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:42.632
...is in our hearts or in our dreams.

01:59:45.636 --> 01:59:49.014
They say swordboatmen suffer from
a lack of dreams.

01:59:50.141 --> 01:59:51.975
That's what begets their courage.

01:59:54.103 --> 01:59:56.271
Well, we'll dream for you...

01:59:56.856 --> 01:59:57.939
...Billy...

01:59:58.733 --> 02:00:00.192
...Bobby...

02:00:00.484 --> 02:00:01.902
...and Murph...

02:00:02.111 --> 02:00:03.361
...Bugsy...

02:00:03.571 --> 02:00:04.779
...Sully...

02:00:04.947 --> 02:00:06.865
...and Alfred Pierre.

02:00:09.452 --> 02:00:11.077
Sleep well.

02:00:11.621 --> 02:00:12.913
Good night.

02:00:39.148 --> 02:00:40.774
I'll be asleep...

02:00:40.983 --> 02:00:43.485
...and then all of a sudden,
there he is.

02:00:45.071 --> 02:00:46.738
That big smile.

02:00:46.948 --> 02:00:48.698
You know that smile.

02:00:50.159 --> 02:00:53.119
And l say,
"Hey, Bobby, where you been?"

02:00:53.829 --> 02:00:55.664
But he won't tell me.

02:00:56.249 --> 02:00:58.833
He just smiles and says:

02:00:59.252 --> 02:01:02.295
"Remember I'll always love you,
Christina.

02:01:02.713 --> 02:01:05.507
I love you now,
and I'll love you forever.

02:01:06.050 --> 02:01:07.717
There's no goodbye.

02:01:08.469 --> 02:01:09.970
Only love."

02:01:11.472 --> 02:01:13.056
And then he's gone.

02:01:16.018 --> 02:01:18.436
But he's always happy when he goes.

02:01:18.771 --> 02:01:22.190
So I know he's gotta be okay.

02:01:23.401 --> 02:01:25.568
Absolutely okay.

02:01:33.369 --> 02:01:35.203
I love your dream.

02:01:44.588 --> 02:01:46.381
<i>The fog's just lifting.</i>

02:01:46.966 --> 02:01:49.968
<i>You throw off your bow line,</i>
<i>throw off your stern.</i>

02:01:50.261 --> 02:01:52.137
<i>You head out the South Channel...</i>

02:01:52.346 --> 02:01:55.307
<i>...past Rocky Neck,</i>
<i>Ten Pound Island...</i>

02:01:55.516 --> 02:01:58.393
<i>...past Niles Pond,</i>
<i>where I skated as a kid.</i>

02:01:59.103 --> 02:02:00.687
<i>You blow your horn and wave to...</i>

02:02:00.896 --> 02:02:03.440
<i>...the lighthouse keeper's kid</i>
<i>on Thatcher Island.</i>

02:02:04.650 --> 02:02:06.443
<i>Then the birds show up.</i>

02:02:06.819 --> 02:02:09.237
<i>Black-backs and herring gulls...</i>

02:02:09.697 --> 02:02:11.031
<i>...big dump ducks.</i>

02:02:11.657 --> 02:02:13.116
<i>The sun hits you.</i>

02:02:13.326 --> 02:02:15.160
<i>You head north, open up to 12.</i>

02:02:15.369 --> 02:02:16.911
<i>You're steaming now.</i>

02:02:17.747 --> 02:02:20.206
<i>The guys are busy,</i>
<i>you're in charge.</i>

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.668
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>You're a goddamn swordboat captain.</i>

02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:26.921
<i>Is there anything better in the world?</i>

02:09:45.819 --> 02:09:47.820
