00:39.127 --> 00:41.891
Atten-hut!

00:41.996 --> 00:45.454
Here's our man.
Professor Howard Plummer.

00:45.567 --> 00:49.230
He's been kidnapped
by a group of Serbian rebels.

00:49.304 --> 00:53.434
I know we've been up for 72
hours, but I expect perfection.

00:53.508 --> 00:55.476
Nothing else.

00:56.911 --> 00:58.572
[beeping]

00:58.646 --> 01:02.810
The enemy has a boat,
four jet skis, and a chopper.

01:02.884 --> 01:05.648
I'll take you guys in
until we hit radar range.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.381
Then you'll dive from there.

01:07.455 --> 01:09.218
Once we hit our target,

01:09.290 --> 01:11.986
Red One, Red Two,
you take out our escorts.

01:12.093 --> 01:15.585
I'll handle the chopper,
and I'll find the professor.

01:15.697 --> 01:18.359
Red Three, you radio in
for our copter.

01:18.433 --> 01:20.492
- Do you copy?
- Sir, yes sir!

01:20.568 --> 01:22.331
- Do you copy?
- [SEALS] Sir, yes sir!

01:22.404 --> 01:26.704
We are SEALS.
And this is what we do.

03:15.083 --> 03:16.550
[beeping]

03:16.618 --> 03:20.987
- Ah!
- [grunting]

03:36.738 --> 03:38.603
[over radio] Red Two, handle the boat.

03:38.673 --> 03:40.766
I'll take care of the bozos
on the jet ski.

03:45.079 --> 03:48.480

- [straining]

03:48.550 --> 03:50.450

03:55.390 --> 03:57.119
Ah!

04:00.061 --> 04:01.426
Oh!

04:14.342 --> 04:17.505
[man straining]

04:21.516 --> 04:22.915
[muffled]

04:22.984 --> 04:25.316
Gotcha.

04:27.755 --> 04:30.087
Lieutenant Shane Wolfe,
U.S. Navy.

04:33.428 --> 04:36.022
- Where is the briefcase?
- [grunting]

04:36.130 --> 04:39.566
It's right behind you.
Man, am I glad to see you.

04:39.667 --> 04:43.603
- I never thought I'd see my family...
- I'll get you out.

04:43.671 --> 04:46.003
We're gonna do it my way.
No highway option.

04:46.074 --> 04:47.769
Yeah, I'm with you. Absolutely.

05:05.960 --> 05:08.656
Lieutenant, thank you so much
for saving my life.

05:08.763 --> 05:12.164
If I had died back there,
my wife, she would've killed me.

05:12.233 --> 05:13.632
Just a joke.

05:13.701 --> 05:17.432
Do you mind if I call my wife
to tell her I'm okay?

05:17.505 --> 05:20.269
I have strict orders
to get you out of here safely.

05:20.341 --> 05:21.501
We gotta keep moving.

05:21.576 --> 05:25.603
Lieutenant, I am safe.
Please. She thinks I'm dead.

05:25.680 --> 05:28.615
- All right, make it quick.
- Okay.

05:28.683 --> 05:32.346
- Zoe, Seth, Lulu, Peter, Tyler.
- [beeping]

05:34.622 --> 05:36.214
It's voice activated.

05:36.290 --> 05:38.850
[chuckles] Hey.

05:38.960 --> 05:40.552
These are my kids.

05:41.896 --> 05:43.989
You'd like 'em.
They're really great.

05:45.033 --> 05:48.560
I doubt it. Hurry up.

05:48.636 --> 05:51.696
Hey! We're almost ready.

05:51.773 --> 05:54.071
Give us another sec.

05:59.247 --> 06:00.544
- Professor!
- [gunshots]

06:00.615 --> 06:02.276
[grunts]

06:08.423 --> 06:10.914
The doctor says you've
healed up real good, Shane.

06:11.025 --> 06:12.959
I should've been
out of here weeks ago.

06:13.027 --> 06:15.018
Look, I know heads
are gonna roll for this.

06:15.129 --> 06:16.426
Hey, you took a bullet.

06:16.497 --> 06:19.159
Yeah, but I want you to know
I take full responsibility

06:19.233 --> 06:21.030
for what happened
to the professor.

06:21.102 --> 06:23.332
Plummer was the best
security expert

06:23.404 --> 06:25.269
the Department of Defense
ever had.

06:25.339 --> 06:29.298
He was working on a program to scramble
launch codes that he called "GHOST":

06:29.377 --> 06:31.811
Guided High-altitude
Scrambling Transmitter.

06:31.879 --> 06:33.540
One pulse from a GHOST satellite

06:33.614 --> 06:35.673
and a country can't launch
its own nukes.

06:35.750 --> 06:37.945
That's why the Serbians
kidnapped him.

06:38.019 --> 06:41.477
They must have thought that
GHOST was in that briefcase.

06:41.556 --> 06:44.548
GHOST is still out there.

06:44.625 --> 06:47.526
Which is why I'm sending you
back in.

06:47.595 --> 06:50.029
I know you've never lost anybody
before, Shane.

06:50.098 --> 06:52.532
I was with your father
when he led a platoon...

06:52.600 --> 06:54.761
With all due respect,

06:54.836 --> 06:57.270
I'd appreciate it if we kept
my father out of this.

06:57.338 --> 07:00.102
All I'm saying is that it
happens to the best of them.

07:01.209 --> 07:02.574
And you're the best.

07:02.643 --> 07:04.634
I need someone I can trust on this

07:04.712 --> 07:07.977
- and I know I can trust you.
- Okay.

07:08.049 --> 07:09.311
I'll put a team together.

07:09.383 --> 07:11.442
No. It's not
that kind of mission.

07:11.519 --> 07:14.386
This is at the top of the Pentagon's
priority list.

07:17.258 --> 07:20.386
[man] Two days ago,
I got a call from Admiral Blair.

07:20.495 --> 07:23.692
It seems that the professor's widow
contacted him.

07:23.765 --> 07:25.232
Whoever killed her husband

07:25.333 --> 07:27.494
must think that GHOST
is still in that house.

07:27.568 --> 07:29.627
Now, maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

07:29.704 --> 07:33.765
A safety deposit box has been discovered
in Zurich in the Plummers' name.

07:33.841 --> 07:37.641
I've been assigned to escort Mrs.
Plummer there to retrieve the contents.

07:37.712 --> 07:40.704
We're hoping it's the GHOSTprogram.

07:40.782 --> 07:43.649
In the meantime, someone
needs to watch over those kids.

07:43.718 --> 07:45.310
That's where you come in.

07:45.386 --> 07:48.514
While there, you'll be looking
for the hidden program as well.

07:48.589 --> 07:51.149
[squeaking]

07:53.194 --> 07:55.526
[squeaks]

08:04.438 --> 08:07.373
[doorbell]

08:07.441 --> 08:09.705
Ah!

08:16.517 --> 08:20.954
You must be Lieutenant Wolfe!
Admiral Blair said you'd be coming.

08:21.022 --> 08:23.047
Come on in.
Meet the rest of the gang.

08:23.124 --> 08:25.319
Come on.

08:25.426 --> 08:30.625
Kids! Get your butts
down here and say hello!

08:30.698 --> 08:36.068
Okay, you've already met Lulu.
This is Zoe, Seth and Peter.

08:36.136 --> 08:39.004
Kids, this is Lieutenant Wolfe.

08:39.073 --> 08:41.006
He's gonna stay with you
while I'm away.

08:41.075 --> 08:43.066
- [kids] Hi.
- Hi.

08:43.144 --> 08:47.444
- Oh! This is Helga and Tyler.
- [baby cooing]

08:47.515 --> 08:49.608
Ma'am. Baby.

08:49.684 --> 08:53.176
- That's a pretty dress.
- [Romanian accent] Thank you.

08:53.254 --> 08:55.745
I have date
with butcher tonight.

08:55.823 --> 08:57.757
I want to look nice.

08:57.859 --> 09:00.089
[gasping] Ah!

09:00.228 --> 09:03.823
[speaking Romanian]

09:03.898 --> 09:06.890
[whimpering]

09:08.669 --> 09:11.263
You have a pleasant family.

09:11.339 --> 09:13.239
Well, for the younger ones,

09:13.307 --> 09:15.366
I think it hasn't really
sunk in yet.

09:15.443 --> 09:19.379
It's been hardest
on Zoe and Seth.

09:19.447 --> 09:21.779
But they don't really
like to talk about it.

09:21.849 --> 09:24.147
Well, it must be hard
on all of you.

09:24.218 --> 09:26.516
[Mrs. Plummer]
Howard wasn't around much.

09:26.587 --> 09:28.646
His work took him
all over the world.

09:28.723 --> 09:31.521
He'd be gone six,
seven months at a time.

09:31.626 --> 09:33.821
Yeah, I can understand
that lifestyle.

09:35.963 --> 09:39.023
Anyway, about a week ago,

09:39.133 --> 09:41.465
someone broke into the house.
No one was home.

09:41.535 --> 09:44.231
I didn't tell the kids 'cause
I didn't wanna scare them.

09:44.305 --> 09:46.034
Mrs. Plummer, I've dealt with...

09:46.107 --> 09:48.302
- Ow! Oh, my God!
- [quacking]

09:48.376 --> 09:51.709
I'm sorry. That's Gary.
He was Howard's.

09:51.779 --> 09:53.644
Gary, down!

09:53.714 --> 09:55.272
He bit me.

09:55.349 --> 09:57.442
Yeah, well,
he thinks he's a guard dog.

09:57.518 --> 10:02.046
- Mrs. Plummer?
- Oh, call me Julie. Please.

10:02.123 --> 10:04.921
I'm gonna go outside
and have a look around.

10:05.026 --> 10:06.357
Out, out.

10:41.262 --> 10:43.787
I'm gonna miss you.
Mmm...

10:43.898 --> 10:45.729
I'm gonna miss you too.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.564
I'll be back in 48 hours, okay?

10:48.636 --> 10:51.332
Bye, pumpkin.
I love you, pumpkin.

10:54.241 --> 10:57.210
Oh, and kids? Remember,

10:57.278 --> 11:00.770
whatever Lieutenant Wolfe
asks you to do, do it.

11:00.848 --> 11:03.874
Mom, chill.
We're gonna be fine.

11:07.188 --> 11:09.349
I'm sorry.
I don't do this very often.

11:09.423 --> 11:11.118
You're going away for a few days.

11:11.225 --> 11:12.487
Yeah, I know.

11:12.593 --> 11:14.458
I got it.

11:14.528 --> 11:16.155
Okay. Here you go, Helga.

11:16.263 --> 11:19.255
- I take baby.
- Bye. Bye.

11:19.367 --> 11:21.835
- It's okay.
- [baby cries]

11:21.902 --> 11:24.234
You remember
the emergency numbers, right?

11:24.305 --> 11:27.297
Don't worry, Mrs. Plummer,
your kids'll be safe with me.

11:27.375 --> 11:31.209
Your little angels will be fine,
Mrs. Plummer.

11:38.819 --> 11:41.652
- Go.
- [engine turns]

11:41.722 --> 11:43.189
- [Helga] Bye-bye.
- Bye.

11:43.257 --> 11:45.282
[Helga] Have some fun.

11:45.393 --> 11:48.590
[chuckles] Bye-bye.

11:50.531 --> 11:54.160
Tell me,
are you licensed to kill?

11:54.235 --> 11:55.862
No, ma'am.

11:55.936 --> 11:59.963
Too bad.
It could have come in handy.

12:01.642 --> 12:06.238
[baby crying]

12:09.617 --> 12:11.414
- [gunshots]
- [Lulu] Ah!

12:11.485 --> 12:13.749
[man] Prepare to be annihilated.

12:15.089 --> 12:16.647
[Lulu] Please!

12:16.724 --> 12:19.215
[Zoe] Oh, my God! Shut up!

12:19.326 --> 12:22.159
[man] Prepare to be annihilated.

12:22.229 --> 12:24.663
- [gunshots]
- [crashing]

12:25.733 --> 12:28.395
Hey!

12:28.469 --> 12:31.438
- Where's the baby?
- [Zoe] Tell me. Come on.

12:31.505 --> 12:33.996
[Zoe laughing] No!

12:34.075 --> 12:36.509
Shut up! No, she didn't.

12:36.577 --> 12:39.205
- Shut up! Shut your mouth!
- [quacking]

12:39.280 --> 12:40.804
[Zoe] Oh, my God. Tell me!

12:40.881 --> 12:43.372
Is there anyone here
that understands

12:43.451 --> 12:45.419
the meaning of the word
"discipline"?

12:45.486 --> 12:50.014
Hey, Flipper. You don't like it?
Do something. I make bottle.

12:50.791 --> 12:53.954
- [gasps]
- [crying]

12:54.061 --> 12:55.426
Thank you, Peter.

12:55.496 --> 12:57.327
[chuckles]

12:57.398 --> 12:58.729
[beeping]

13:03.804 --> 13:06.830
- Yes!
- [beeping stops]

13:21.555 --> 13:23.989
- Ow!
- Gotcha!

13:24.058 --> 13:27.118
- Ah!
- [grunting]

13:29.730 --> 13:31.698
[sirens blaring]

13:31.765 --> 13:33.323
What's your problem?
Get off me!

13:33.434 --> 13:34.401
[Zoe] Oh, my God!

13:34.502 --> 13:37.096
What are you doing, you spaz?
That's my boyfriend!

13:37.171 --> 13:39.230
So you're the one breaking in!

13:39.306 --> 13:40.796
- Go back inside!
- No!

13:40.875 --> 13:45.278
[woman speaking Korean]

13:48.516 --> 13:52.953
[speaking Korean]

13:53.020 --> 13:54.988
We speak English, buddy.

13:55.055 --> 13:57.580
Look, about the sirens
and the strobe lights.

13:57.691 --> 14:00.785
We own a bakery, so we're up
kind of early. Would you mind?

14:00.928 --> 14:02.657
Sorry.

14:02.730 --> 14:04.595
[sirens stop]

14:04.665 --> 14:07.862
Oh, and we found this
in our pool filter.

14:07.935 --> 14:10.495
Keep that zoo reined in,
huh, babysitter?

14:10.571 --> 14:12.300
[squeaking]

14:12.373 --> 14:16.275
Yo, fool, handle me like that again
and I'll lay knuckles upside your head!

14:16.343 --> 14:18.868
Okay! Enough is enough!
Come on, Scott, let's go!

14:18.946 --> 14:20.538
- Come on.
- No, you don't.

14:20.614 --> 14:25.551
Get back here.
Give me 20.

14:25.619 --> 14:27.086
I meant push-ups!

14:27.154 --> 14:30.419
- Zoe?
- Drop down! Do 20!

14:30.491 --> 14:33.585
- This is not the Army or Navy!
- [Wolfe] One...

14:33.694 --> 14:35.821
Real nice move, Lt. Smooth.

14:35.930 --> 14:37.591
He'll probably never speak to me!

14:37.698 --> 14:40.166
- Then I did you a favor.
- Whoa!

14:40.234 --> 14:41.826
Personal bubble invasion.

14:41.902 --> 14:44.200
Your mother was worried sick
about you!

14:44.271 --> 14:46.171
You should call here and tell her.

14:46.240 --> 14:48.470
I'm sure you'll take care of that
for me.

14:48.542 --> 14:51.170
Stay out of my life!

14:51.245 --> 14:52.803
[grunts]

14:52.880 --> 14:53.904
[groans]

14:53.981 --> 14:56.142
Wait! You can't do this!

14:56.217 --> 14:59.050
I have plans!
It's Saturday night! Ow!

14:59.119 --> 15:00.450
Not anymore.

15:02.623 --> 15:07.583
- You too. Lights out.
- [scoffs] Bite me.

15:07.695 --> 15:10.129
Boy, this family's in
for a rude awakening.

15:10.197 --> 15:13.928
# Don't make a move
till you're in the groove

15:14.001 --> 15:18.267
# And do the Peter Panda dance

15:18.339 --> 15:22.435
# Just hop three times
like a kangaroo

15:22.509 --> 15:26.468
# Side-step twice
just like those crabs do

15:26.547 --> 15:31.041
# Three steps forward
One step back

15:31.118 --> 15:36.181
# Then quick like a turtle
Lie on your back

15:36.257 --> 15:39.954
# Roll like a log
till you can't no more...

15:40.060 --> 15:42.528
[birds chirping]

15:42.596 --> 15:45.463
[whistle blowing]

15:46.166 --> 15:47.827
[shrieks]

15:54.108 --> 15:55.439
What are you doing?

15:55.509 --> 15:57.500
You're burning daylight! Move!

15:57.578 --> 16:00.069
It's Sunday.

16:00.180 --> 16:03.081
And it's 6am!
You're insane!

16:10.224 --> 16:11.987
- Listen up!
- [Helga chattering]

16:12.092 --> 16:14.754
Your behavior is unacceptable.

16:14.862 --> 16:17.126
In order to maintain
a state of safety,

16:17.197 --> 16:19.028
we need to maintain
a state of order.

16:19.099 --> 16:21.192
[Helga] One more little bite?

16:21.268 --> 16:23.702
We going to be strong mine
worker when we grow up.

16:23.771 --> 16:25.170
Excuse me.

16:25.239 --> 16:26.934
Excuse me!

16:28.809 --> 16:31.175
Now, I've only got one rule.

16:31.245 --> 16:34.214
Everything is done my way.
No highway option.

16:34.281 --> 16:36.647
- Do you copy?
- Do you copy?

16:36.717 --> 16:40.244
What? I said, "Do you copy?"

16:40.321 --> 16:43.518
What? I said, "Do you copy?"

16:43.590 --> 16:47.583
- Do not copy me.
- Do not copy me.

16:47.695 --> 16:50.186
Hey, I mean it.
Cut it out!

16:50.297 --> 16:52.697
Hey, I mean it.
Cut it out!

16:52.766 --> 16:54.563
- Uh...
- [Gary quacking]

16:54.635 --> 16:56.296
- [Peter farts]
- [quacking]

16:56.370 --> 16:58.395
- Peter farted.
- [kids groaning]

16:58.472 --> 17:00.804
- [Zoe] Oh, that is so gross.
- [Wolfe] Quiet!

17:00.874 --> 17:04.810
Everybody up.
That means you too.

17:04.877 --> 17:08.336
Tracking devices,
never take them off.

17:08.415 --> 17:12.579
The panic button
is for emergencies only.

17:12.653 --> 17:15.554
Touch that,
you'd better be dying.

17:15.622 --> 17:17.487
- [beeps]
- Or you're dead.

17:17.558 --> 17:20.550
I would rather chew off my arm
than wear that.

17:20.627 --> 17:24.790
Just because my mom is paranoid doesn't
mean we have to take orders from you.

17:24.865 --> 17:27.128
Let me explain how
the chain of command works.

17:27.201 --> 17:30.034
I tell you what to do
and you do it!

17:30.104 --> 17:33.130
End of chain.

17:33.207 --> 17:36.199
I'm not gonna have time
to remember all of your names.

17:36.276 --> 17:41.646
You'll be Red Leader.
Red Baby. Red One. Red.

17:43.584 --> 17:46.576
Where's the older male?
There were five.

17:46.653 --> 17:49.986
He walks like Dracula

17:50.057 --> 17:55.222
with footsteps
silent like death.

17:55.329 --> 17:56.990
[Zoe] He's in his room.

18:00.801 --> 18:02.291
Red Two!

18:04.104 --> 18:05.537
Red Two, open up!

18:06.473 --> 18:08.202
Red Two!

18:13.313 --> 18:16.544
[toilet flushing]

18:16.617 --> 18:18.551
What have you done?

18:18.619 --> 18:20.211
What? I thought...

18:20.287 --> 18:22.653
Is this what you're
trained to do?

18:22.723 --> 18:24.486
A "shock and awe" on my door?

18:24.558 --> 18:27.618
I can fix that
with a hammer and some nails.

18:27.728 --> 18:29.787
- It's real easy to fix.
- No, it's not! Look!

18:29.897 --> 18:33.697
It's broken in half!
You can't fix that!

18:33.767 --> 18:37.225
If you'd been wearing this,
this wouldn't have happened.

18:37.304 --> 18:42.674
What are you talking about?
I was in the bathroom!

18:42.743 --> 18:45.712
You know I would never
ask you for your help...

18:45.779 --> 18:48.179
...but he has got to go.

18:49.216 --> 18:51.411
[beeping]

19:05.766 --> 19:08.462
[Lulu] Somebody help me, please!

19:08.535 --> 19:10.594
- Help me, somebody!
- [moaning]

19:10.671 --> 19:15.040
- Stop it, Peter! This is nuts!
- Peter, cut this out.

19:17.945 --> 19:22.973
Hey, good soldiers
aren't scared of anything.

19:23.050 --> 19:24.915
I'm not scared. I'm annoyed.

19:24.985 --> 19:28.250
Ever since he heard Daddy say
there was a ghost in the house,

19:28.322 --> 19:32.691
he puts on that blanket and chases me
everywhere. It drives me crazy.

19:32.793 --> 19:34.420
Peter, have you seen this ghost?

19:42.536 --> 19:44.436
All right, here he comes.

19:58.218 --> 20:01.449
Hey! You leave towel
on floor in bathroom.

20:01.522 --> 20:04.855
I pick up after kids,
not you.

20:04.958 --> 20:07.722
And light a match next time.

20:07.828 --> 20:11.594
[gasping] Oh!

20:12.332 --> 20:15.563
[groaning]

20:18.639 --> 20:21.005
[honking]

20:22.376 --> 20:23.900
[French accent]
Good news.

20:23.977 --> 20:26.104
Your background checks
have cleared,

20:26.179 --> 20:28.113
and we are free
to give you the box.

20:28.181 --> 20:29.910
- Oh.
- Excellent.

20:29.983 --> 20:33.441
Just as soon as you
provide us with the passwords.

20:33.520 --> 20:34.680
Passwords?

20:34.755 --> 20:36.245
It was your husband's wish

20:36.323 --> 20:38.382
that the person who collects the box

20:38.492 --> 20:40.926
must provide us
with the passwords.

20:41.995 --> 20:43.087
Great.

20:43.196 --> 20:45.960
- Is it "The GHOST?"
- Ghost.

20:46.033 --> 20:47.660
Mmm... No.

20:49.903 --> 20:51.530
- [door slamming]
- [grumbling]

20:51.605 --> 20:56.008
These brats! Sugi pula!

20:56.076 --> 20:58.169
I had it!

20:58.245 --> 21:02.113
- Remain calm.
- I am calm.

21:02.182 --> 21:06.243
I quit!
That makes me calm.

21:06.320 --> 21:09.187
Let's not be hasty about this.

21:10.991 --> 21:13.789
[ringing]

21:19.433 --> 21:21.298
[Mrs. Miller] Hello? Hello?

21:21.368 --> 21:25.327
- Don't even think about it!
- [Mrs. Miller] Lt. Wolfe?

21:25.405 --> 21:26.531
It's Julie Plummer.

21:26.607 --> 21:28.404
- Who's this?
- Julie Plummer.

21:28.475 --> 21:30.636
- What's that?
- Julie Plummer!

21:30.711 --> 21:32.679
- [grunting]
- Ah!

21:32.746 --> 21:35.078
- Oh, Mrs. Plummer.
- Did something fall?

21:35.148 --> 21:38.140
- What was that noise?
- Nothing. Everything's okay!

21:38.218 --> 21:42.086
You'll be happy to know that I found
the culprit that's been sneaking around!

21:42.155 --> 21:44.214
- Great. Who was it?
- Just some teenager.

21:44.291 --> 21:47.852
Teenager? I wanted to tell you
I'm gonna be a few more days.

21:47.961 --> 21:50.020
- You'll be a few more days?
- [screaming]

21:50.130 --> 21:53.759
- Yes, is that a problem?
- No, that's no problem!

21:53.834 --> 21:57.361
[straining] No, I'm fine.
I'm just... I'm just doing my...

21:57.437 --> 21:58.961
- [grunts]
- Your what?

22:00.474 --> 22:02.874
- Duty.
- Sure everything's okay?

22:02.943 --> 22:04.535
Things are great,
Mrs. Plummer.

22:04.611 --> 22:06.943
Yeah, you just do
whatever you have to.

22:07.014 --> 22:10.040
- Well, tell the kids I said...
- Bye, Mrs. Plummer!

22:11.618 --> 22:13.745
[Wolfe] Just hang...
Let's calm down.

22:13.820 --> 22:15.651
[both panting]

22:15.722 --> 22:18.054
Just... just try to relax.

22:18.158 --> 22:22.754
- [growling]
- [groaning] Ah!

22:28.535 --> 22:30.765
- Ah! She bit me!
- [Helga grunting]

22:30.837 --> 22:33.601
- [sirens blaring]
- Red Leader!

22:33.674 --> 22:36.837
I command you to come back here!
That's a direct order!

22:36.910 --> 22:39.105
You can't leave a man behind!

22:39.179 --> 22:41.340
Red Leader!

22:42.149 --> 22:43.377
Red Leader!

22:43.450 --> 22:46.283
I don't even know
how to change a diaper!

22:47.554 --> 22:49.715
[woman] Don't worry!

22:49.790 --> 22:52.884
If she loves you,
she'll come back, huh?

22:52.993 --> 22:54.426
[bells ringing]

22:54.494 --> 22:58.191
Okay, everybody, listen up.
There's been a change of plans.

22:58.265 --> 23:00.927
Your mother's not coming home
as soon as she expected.

23:01.001 --> 23:03.526
- When is she coming back?
- [Wolfe] Soon.

23:03.603 --> 23:05.730
For now,
we'll just have some more big fun.

23:05.806 --> 23:07.967
That's what we've been doing?
Having fun?

23:08.041 --> 23:11.374
- Tomorrow's a school day.
- [Seth] I have wrestling.

23:11.445 --> 23:13.003
I need a release for Driver's Ed.

23:13.080 --> 23:14.570
I've got Fireflies.

23:14.648 --> 23:15.808
I have to go to the mall.

23:15.882 --> 23:17.816
I have to stop her
from spending so much.

23:17.884 --> 23:20.148
Whoa, okay, Halt. Halt!

23:20.220 --> 23:22.381
We'll take this hill
one inch at a time.

23:22.456 --> 23:24.390
Only then can we rise
to the challenge.

23:24.458 --> 23:26.517
[Peter farts]

23:28.729 --> 23:31.630
[Wolfe] Okay,
who's gonna change Red Baby?

23:31.698 --> 23:33.256
Guys?

23:38.472 --> 23:39.871
Ah!

23:40.907 --> 23:44.035
God! Red Baby!

23:45.846 --> 23:48.781
- Alrighty. We'll try this.
- [toilet flushing]

23:48.849 --> 23:51.181
Yes. Whoa.

23:51.251 --> 23:54.118
Ooh. Soak that up a bit.

24:03.029 --> 24:05.691
Hi. Zoe says you look
like The Hulk.

24:05.766 --> 24:07.427
I think you're cute.

24:07.501 --> 24:09.526
Thank you.

24:13.106 --> 24:15.870
- Do you do kung fu?
- Yes.

24:15.942 --> 24:19.434
Did you ever punch someone
so hard that their head came off?

24:19.513 --> 24:21.344
No.

24:22.582 --> 24:24.516
Why are your boobs so big?

24:27.220 --> 24:29.279
They're not boobs.

24:29.356 --> 24:31.517
Do you have to wear a bra?

24:38.231 --> 24:40.256
Will my boobs
get as big as yours someday?

24:44.905 --> 24:46.702
You know, little girl,

24:46.773 --> 24:51.540
I think it's time you went
nappy-poo in beddy-bye land.

24:51.611 --> 24:55.172
Do I look like I'm five to you?

24:56.817 --> 24:58.614
What did I say?

24:58.718 --> 25:02.245
Disrespectful. And to think
I was interested in you!

25:02.289 --> 25:03.984
[door slams]

25:05.959 --> 25:08.894
[Wolfe] Okay, troops! Breakfast!

25:08.962 --> 25:11.123
What are you waiting for?
Dig in.

25:11.231 --> 25:12.698
Feel free to mix and match.

25:12.799 --> 25:15.359
Stay away from the cheese.
It'll back you up.

25:15.435 --> 25:18.563
Don't worry about running out.
I can get lots more of these.

25:18.638 --> 25:20.697
I've survived months
off this stuff.

25:20.774 --> 25:23.572
Okay, like, I'm really gonna eat
all of these carbs?

25:23.643 --> 25:24.769
[gary quacking]

25:24.845 --> 25:26.710
I can cross my eyes.
Wanna see?

25:26.780 --> 25:28.179
No.

25:31.585 --> 25:34.782
[crying]

25:36.022 --> 25:37.819
Tyler hates it when I do that.

25:37.891 --> 25:39.722
I know how he feels.

25:41.695 --> 25:45.187
What's he...? Red Four!

25:45.298 --> 25:48.859
[Tyler crying]

25:50.303 --> 25:52.430
[ringing]

25:54.107 --> 25:57.167
- Plummer residence.
- [man muffled over phone]

25:57.244 --> 26:00.145
Yes, I know it's Monday today.

26:00.247 --> 26:02.238
No, Mrs. Plummer's away.

26:02.282 --> 26:04.944
Yes, we'll be right there.

26:05.919 --> 26:07.511
Who was that?

26:07.587 --> 26:09.817
Your vice principal.

26:09.890 --> 26:12.358
He said that if you and Seth
are late again,

26:12.459 --> 26:14.051
you're both suspended.

26:14.160 --> 26:16.822
He wants to see you
in his office right away.

26:31.578 --> 26:33.375
[beeping]

26:52.532 --> 26:55.000
What is it?

26:55.101 --> 26:58.161
- It's a minivan.
- Ugh.

26:58.238 --> 27:00.798
[Wolfe] Now,
is this supposed to...?

27:00.874 --> 27:03.365
- How do we...?
- Excuse me, Mr. Wolfe?

27:03.443 --> 27:05.911
If you don't hurry up,
we're gonna be late for sure.

27:05.979 --> 27:07.970
Not on my watch.

27:13.353 --> 27:15.981
- Hold that.
- How fast is your watch?

27:18.091 --> 27:20.116
You'll be suspended for sure.

27:20.226 --> 27:21.284
[screeching]

27:21.394 --> 27:23.692
- [Seth] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- [Zoe] Oh, my God!

27:23.763 --> 27:26.323
Who drives like this?
You're crazy!

27:28.201 --> 27:34.071
- [bell ringing]
- [kids chattering]

27:36.476 --> 27:38.944
[Seth] What are you doing?
Stop!

27:40.180 --> 27:42.512
[footsteps approaching]

27:42.582 --> 27:44.209
- [bell ringing]
- Got 'em here.

27:44.284 --> 27:46.377
My fault.

27:46.453 --> 27:50.514
Yeah, I always said these kids
needed a parole officer.

27:50.590 --> 27:53.650
I guess, uh, Mrs. Plummer
thought so too, huh?

27:55.895 --> 27:59.194
Wow, you got a real, uh,
upper torso going on, huh?

27:59.265 --> 28:00.857
You ever, uh, do any time?

28:02.535 --> 28:04.901
- [low] Sasquatch.
- [Zoe giggles]

28:04.971 --> 28:07.804
- You got something to say, boy?
- No.

28:07.874 --> 28:09.569
No? Good.

28:09.642 --> 28:12.668
Wow, it looks like you
have a pair of legs

28:12.746 --> 28:14.407
coming out of your shoulders.

28:14.481 --> 28:17.177
- You hit the gym a lot, do you?
- Eh.

28:17.250 --> 28:19.878
- [low] Woolly Mammoth.
- You know what, Creeper?

28:19.953 --> 28:23.650
You just bought yourself
an extra 15 minutes on the mats.

28:23.723 --> 28:25.884
With the Murninator!

28:25.992 --> 28:29.359
Excuse me.
Lieutenant Shane Wolfe.

28:29.429 --> 28:32.694
I'm watching the kids
for the Plummers. A few days.

28:32.766 --> 28:35.098
Oh, babysitter, huh?

28:35.168 --> 28:38.001
Well, good.
Whatever job you can get, right?

28:38.071 --> 28:41.097
I'm Murney.
Duane Murney.

28:41.174 --> 28:43.506
My friends call me
"Little Puppet."

28:43.576 --> 28:44.975
I'm the VP here.

28:45.045 --> 28:48.572
I'm in charge of discipline,
conduct and truancy

28:48.648 --> 28:52.880
from top to bottom,
K through 12.

28:52.952 --> 28:55.284
You're in my house now,
strong man.

28:55.355 --> 28:58.984
- You're the vice principal.
- And the wrestling coach.

28:59.092 --> 29:00.650
See the Creeper over there?

29:00.760 --> 29:04.321
He has played hooky from every
wrestling practice this month.

29:04.431 --> 29:08.424
And her, she has missed
22 Driver's Ed classes.

29:08.535 --> 29:11.060
Out of 23!

29:11.137 --> 29:13.469
These are the worst students
in my school.

29:13.540 --> 29:16.566
- I'm ashamed...
- [woman] Your school?

29:18.344 --> 29:20.812
Good morning, kids.

29:20.880 --> 29:23.781
[clears throat] Mr. Murney,
thanks for watching my chair.

29:23.850 --> 29:26.683
- I'll take it from here.
- [Murney] Roger. Absolutely.

29:26.753 --> 29:28.778
I was just informing
our new friend here

29:28.855 --> 29:31.187
about some of the duties
as vice principal.

29:31.257 --> 29:34.124
Speaking of which, how's it
going with the investigation

29:34.227 --> 29:36.695
into the baloney slices
on the cafeteria ceiling?

29:36.763 --> 29:39.857
- Taking some interesting turns.
- Keep up the good work.

29:39.966 --> 29:43.197
Right. I'll be on the roof.

29:43.269 --> 29:45.703
Bye, now.

29:45.772 --> 29:48.070
All right, it's time
to get back to class.

29:48.141 --> 29:52.202
I'll cut you some slack seeing as
it's Lt. Wolfe's first day. Thank you.

29:52.278 --> 29:54.803
Okay.

29:54.881 --> 29:57.349
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Yes, please.

30:00.453 --> 30:02.785
So, what's with this Murninator?

30:02.856 --> 30:05.450
He's big, he's hairy,
he's sometimes smelly,

30:05.558 --> 30:07.719
but he's harmless
and he has tenure.

30:07.827 --> 30:10.387
[sighs] So, you're the bodyguard?

30:10.497 --> 30:12.294
Mrs. Plummer thought the kids...

30:12.365 --> 30:15.801
She briefed me on everything
and she told me that the kids

30:15.869 --> 30:17.769
aren't fully aware of the situation

30:17.837 --> 30:19.930
and that's the way she wants it.

30:21.841 --> 30:24.776
She also told me
you're a "Teams" guy.

30:24.844 --> 30:27.745
- Yes, I am.
- Well, Petty Officer Third Class

30:27.814 --> 30:30.840
- Claire Fletcher at your service.
- You're kidding.

30:30.917 --> 30:34.080
Four years at Naval Base
Coronado. They paid for college.

30:34.154 --> 30:36.987
- Honor, courage.
- Commitment.

30:37.056 --> 30:39.217
It's the way I run this school.

30:39.325 --> 30:40.622
I like that.

30:44.097 --> 30:48.329
So, permission to stick around
and keep eyes on the kids?

30:48.401 --> 30:50.665
Permission granted.

30:50.737 --> 30:53.171
[kids chattering]

30:59.946 --> 31:03.040
[girls] We don't need no music
We don't need no band

31:03.116 --> 31:07.018
All we need is Mustangs
and jammin' in the stands

31:07.086 --> 31:09.350
We said jammin' in the stands

31:09.422 --> 31:12.687
J-A-M-M-l-N
Jammin' in the stands

31:12.792 --> 31:16.785
What? J-A-M-M-l-N
Jammin' in the stands

31:16.896 --> 31:19.888
- Go, Mustangs! Whoo!
- [beeping]

31:19.999 --> 31:23.400
[Wolfe] "Black belt.
Honorable discharge."

31:23.469 --> 31:25.460
Clean as a whistle.

31:25.538 --> 31:27.005
[chuckles]

31:27.073 --> 31:30.338
- Yeah, you little punk!
- Where's your babysitter now?

31:34.314 --> 31:36.009
Hey!

31:36.082 --> 31:38.949
- Enough.
- All right, you heard the lady.

31:39.018 --> 31:41.612
Let's break it up, guys.
Come on. Hmm?

31:41.688 --> 31:45.351
Relax, Popeye.
Boys will be boys, huh?

31:45.425 --> 31:49.293
It's kinda good for the Creeper.
Gives him a chance to punk up.

31:49.362 --> 31:52.661
- Learn to defend himself.
- Six against one?

31:52.732 --> 31:54.666
Well, the odds are never pretty.

31:54.734 --> 31:57.066
But look at it as, like,
a preparation for him.

31:57.136 --> 31:58.865
The naked streets of Bethesda

31:58.972 --> 32:00.997
can be so dark and dangerous.

32:01.040 --> 32:05.101
- Right, Creeper?
- Ooh. Whoa.

32:05.178 --> 32:07.408
You're pretty quick there, frogman.

32:07.480 --> 32:09.710
I, myself,
happen to be a black belt.

32:09.782 --> 32:12.512
That's why they wanted me
to coach the wrestling team.

32:12.585 --> 32:15.019
Ooh-ah! [snorts]

32:15.088 --> 32:17.352
Sensei. [neck cracks]

32:17.423 --> 32:19.584
You know what that's called, homeboy?

32:19.692 --> 32:21.990
Total control.

32:22.095 --> 32:23.619
You all right? Hmm?

32:23.730 --> 32:26.528
Maybe sometime you can pop by
the wrestling class

32:26.599 --> 32:29.261
and, uh, we'll show the boys
how a couple pros do it.

32:29.335 --> 32:31.360
What do you think?
I'll go easy on you.

32:31.437 --> 32:34.099
- I'm on duty.
- You're on duty.

32:34.173 --> 32:36.266
Oh, that's right,
you're a babysitter.

32:36.342 --> 32:39.368
So it's kinda like "doo-doo" duty.

32:39.445 --> 32:41.470
[laughs]

32:41.547 --> 32:43.208
Don't worry about it.

32:43.283 --> 32:47.219
We'll do it on a day when you're
not, uh, washing your hair. Hmm?

32:48.655 --> 32:51.749
And I'll see you in class.

32:52.692 --> 32:54.626
At ease.

32:57.063 --> 32:59.054
That guy don't have his head on right.

32:59.198 --> 33:02.793
I was fine!
I don't need your help!

33:06.706 --> 33:08.640
Okay, okay.

33:08.708 --> 33:13.975
- Aw. Hey, rough day?
- I tried feeding him.

33:14.047 --> 33:15.639
Yeah? Did you try changing him?

33:15.715 --> 33:18.513
- Would you help me?
- No.

33:18.584 --> 33:21.246
- Just the thought of...
- [beeping]

33:26.859 --> 33:30.795
- Emergency.
- What are you...? I... Hey!

33:31.531 --> 33:33.396
Hi.

33:33.466 --> 33:35.434
[girl] What's up with him?

33:43.609 --> 33:47.545
- [honking]
- [screeching]

33:57.457 --> 34:01.018
- [honking]
- [screeching]

34:06.099 --> 34:08.397
[screeching]

34:08.467 --> 34:10.493
Where are you going?

34:20.480 --> 34:24.849
[man] Hey!
What's wrong with you?

34:30.690 --> 34:33.090
[beeping continues]

34:57.717 --> 35:00.242
[door slams]

35:12.732 --> 35:15.098
[all gasping]

35:16.235 --> 35:18.226
Ha-ha.

35:19.839 --> 35:21.136
I should go, okay?

35:21.207 --> 35:23.539
Call me, you guys,
if you need anything.

35:23.609 --> 35:26.373
My number's on the fridge.

35:26.446 --> 35:27.936
Are you okay?

35:28.014 --> 35:31.643
- Oh... Wow.
- [flies buzzing]

35:34.187 --> 35:35.882
Is there anything I can do?

35:35.988 --> 35:37.683
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

35:37.790 --> 35:40.623
- Can I get you anything?
- I'm fine.

35:40.693 --> 35:43.753
I mean, they're just kids,
you know.

35:43.830 --> 35:46.230
Call me if you need anything.
Okay?

35:46.299 --> 35:49.166
After you shower.
Or, before. It doesn't matter.

35:49.235 --> 35:51.226
I'll see you guys.

35:52.205 --> 35:55.003
- [gagging]
- [door shuts]

35:55.074 --> 35:59.511
Very funny.
Thank you for the letter.

36:21.367 --> 36:24.063
[giggling]

36:24.136 --> 36:27.503
[Lulu] Guys, be quiet.
I told you he had boobs.

36:28.941 --> 36:31.671
Lulu, can I see you
in the family room?

36:35.448 --> 36:38.042
Who are those people?

36:38.117 --> 36:41.780
My troop. Monday, Wednesday
and Saturday are troop nights.

36:41.888 --> 36:43.753
- Get rid of 'em.
- I can't.

36:43.823 --> 36:46.917
Parents go out on troop nights.
They'll be back at 8:00.

36:47.026 --> 36:48.516
Mom's our den mother!

36:48.628 --> 36:51.893
You better tell your little
friends that they have to...

36:58.371 --> 37:02.307
- Today we're supposed to sell cookies.
- I don't do cookies.

37:02.375 --> 37:05.105
We have to. If we don't
sell enough cookies,

37:05.177 --> 37:07.839
we can't go
to the Jamboree.

37:13.519 --> 37:15.578
They're waving at me.

37:15.688 --> 37:20.125
All right, ladies!
Here's how it's gonna be!

37:20.192 --> 37:22.922
Tonight I'm your den mother.

37:22.995 --> 37:25.623
That means if you want
to live to see tomorrow,

37:25.698 --> 37:27.598
you do exactly as I say!

37:27.667 --> 37:29.862
Do we understand each other?

37:29.936 --> 37:32.871
Den mother,
you frighten me.

37:32.939 --> 37:34.668
Good.

37:34.740 --> 37:36.867
Now, let's move out!

37:47.887 --> 37:49.718
- I call the front!
- Middle back!

37:49.822 --> 37:51.483
Fine, I'll get the back.

37:51.591 --> 37:54.025
[Zoe] Yeah, he's kind
of a dork, but he's okay.

37:54.093 --> 37:56.391
- [Julie on phone] How's Helga?
- Helga's fine.

37:56.462 --> 37:58.760
- When are you getting home?
- I'm sorry...

37:58.831 --> 38:02.528
Look, Mom, I'd love to stay and chat
all day, but I have homework to do.

38:18.851 --> 38:21.877
[cash register beeping]

38:23.556 --> 38:25.751
Oh, no!
They're back!

38:32.465 --> 38:35.923
Hey, Skeever, what glows
in the dark till you squish 'em?

38:36.002 --> 38:37.094
Fireflies!

38:37.169 --> 38:39.603
[boys laughing]

38:45.645 --> 38:47.772
Please. Leave us alone.

38:47.847 --> 38:49.678
This is troop 16 territory.

38:49.749 --> 38:52.115
How are we supposed
to sell raffle tickets

38:52.184 --> 38:54.778
if this place reeks
of your skanky cookies?

38:54.887 --> 38:57.048
Hey! Hey!

38:57.156 --> 38:59.716
- Boo!
- [girls screaming]

38:59.825 --> 39:01.122
[boys laughing]

39:01.193 --> 39:02.717
[boys] Get outta here!

39:02.828 --> 39:06.264
- These cookies taste disgusting.
- I know.

39:06.332 --> 39:10.268
- We really scared these guys.
- Where are my troops?

39:10.336 --> 39:12.531
[beeping]

39:21.647 --> 39:22.978
Lulu, what happened?

39:23.049 --> 39:25.609
Those boys over there
broke our cookies.

39:25.685 --> 39:27.277
Broke your cookies.

39:27.386 --> 39:29.877
- Mm-hm.
- Lulu, this is not a toy.

39:29.989 --> 39:34.983
Forget those boys. I am here
to protect you, not cookies.

39:35.094 --> 39:37.062
Understand?

39:37.163 --> 39:40.326
Good, now get in the car.
We're all going home.

39:40.399 --> 39:44.096
Wait. You can't take us home yet.
You're supposed to take us to eat.

39:45.004 --> 39:47.029
Where do you usually go?

39:47.106 --> 39:50.473
Welcome to Woody Woodchuck's!

39:50.543 --> 39:52.875
[children yelling, playing]

39:57.583 --> 40:00.347
[woman] Let go!

40:03.422 --> 40:05.982
And they say war is hell.

40:06.092 --> 40:09.061
# Whenever we go out
The people always shout

40:09.128 --> 40:11.722
# There goes Shane Jacob
Jingleheimer Schmidt

40:11.797 --> 40:13.560
# Dah dah dah dah dah

40:13.632 --> 40:16.226
# Shane Jacob
Jingleheimer Schmidt

40:16.302 --> 40:19.271
# His name is my name too #

40:19.338 --> 40:21.829
- [tires screech]
- [girls scream]

40:24.977 --> 40:27.207
Ah! I figured you'd
come back for him.

40:27.279 --> 40:30.180
Lulu, watch your brother.
Inexcusable!

40:30.249 --> 40:32.774
- I've never left a man behind.
- Oh, relax.

40:32.852 --> 40:36.310
Once we found a kid in the ball pool
when we opened in the morning.

40:36.388 --> 40:37.787
Whoa! Whoa!

40:37.857 --> 40:42.487
Not cool! Uh, there is no
freestyling in the ball pool!

40:42.561 --> 40:44.358
[giggling]

40:53.506 --> 40:55.838
Should we send
someone in after him?

40:59.145 --> 41:01.807
[screaming]

41:01.881 --> 41:03.610
We're good.

41:08.954 --> 41:12.481
- [hip-hop music plays]
- [yelling]

41:13.993 --> 41:16.587
[Lulu] Holy baloney.

41:16.662 --> 41:20.564
Ooh! Someone's gonna get busted!

41:20.633 --> 41:23.158
- Who are these people?
- What's wrong with this?

41:23.235 --> 41:27.535
- We need to talk.
- Don't hate the player, hate the game.

41:31.477 --> 41:33.911
[air squealing]

41:33.979 --> 41:36.038
Beat it.

41:37.383 --> 41:39.146
[music stops]

41:39.218 --> 41:40.947
Party's over!

41:41.053 --> 41:42.748
Oh, my God, it's here.

41:42.855 --> 41:45.824
You're all gonna clean
this house spotless.

41:45.925 --> 41:49.156
No highway option.
Now, get cleaning.

41:49.228 --> 41:51.196
- I'm outta here!
- [Zoe] Wait! Scott!

41:51.263 --> 41:53.288
[Scott] Move! Later!

41:53.365 --> 41:54.730
[screaming]

42:00.973 --> 42:03.066
Oh, no, you don't.

42:11.650 --> 42:13.641
This is my favorite shirt.

42:28.334 --> 42:30.393
Thank you.

42:57.463 --> 42:59.829
Come on, Seth! You've
been in there for an hour!

42:59.899 --> 43:02.163
[footsteps]

43:02.234 --> 43:05.635
Thanks a lot, Lt. Loser! Now
I'm gonna be the school joke.

43:05.704 --> 43:07.934
I don't know what
I'll say to my friends.

43:08.007 --> 43:10.976
You call those people
your friends?

43:11.043 --> 43:14.535
They have no respect for you.
They have no respect for your home.

43:14.613 --> 43:17.173
You have no respect
for yourself!

43:17.249 --> 43:19.649
I do, too, respect myself!

43:19.718 --> 43:22.084
Company downstairs.
That means you too.

43:22.187 --> 43:24.587
You're not my dad.

43:24.657 --> 43:26.522
In case you
haven't noticed,

43:26.592 --> 43:29.288
this family is going through
a really hard time

43:29.361 --> 43:31.955
and you're just making
everything a lot worse.

43:32.031 --> 43:34.090
You have no feelings.

43:34.166 --> 43:37.897
We hate you
and you hate us.

43:37.970 --> 43:40.268
So why don't you
just leave us alone?

43:40.339 --> 43:43.672
Don't worry. When your
mom comes back, I'm gone.

43:43.742 --> 43:45.209
[crashing]

43:45.277 --> 43:48.269
- Now what?
- Scott.

43:50.950 --> 43:53.145
Run! Take the babies!
Go to your rooms!

43:54.186 --> 43:55.949
[karate yells]

44:04.196 --> 44:06.096
[grunting]

44:16.475 --> 44:18.739
Shane! Come over here!
Take one of these!

44:18.811 --> 44:20.176
Lulu!

44:21.380 --> 44:24.611
- Get inside. Come on.
- Hey! Hey! Wait!

45:18.037 --> 45:19.664
[screaming]

45:25.778 --> 45:27.871
Don't move.

45:30.282 --> 45:31.510
[quacking]

45:32.484 --> 45:34.315
Ahhhh!

45:34.420 --> 45:35.682
[grunting, groaning]

45:35.788 --> 45:38.052
[panting]

45:44.763 --> 45:46.993
Kids, it's safe!

45:47.066 --> 45:50.695
- Who was that? What'd they want?
- What happened?

45:50.769 --> 45:52.930
- Don't leave us!
- [Seth] What do they want?

45:53.005 --> 45:55.872
They were after the program
that your father invented.

45:59.678 --> 46:01.908
They were after this.

46:03.582 --> 46:06.915
All right, all right, come on,
guys. Let's hope this is it.

46:12.057 --> 46:15.515
- 9-2-6, 3-1-0-4-3.
- 9-2-6...

46:15.627 --> 46:16.651
3-1-0-4-3.

46:16.762 --> 46:18.627
They want our
Ghost movie?

46:18.697 --> 46:20.528
Haven't they heard
of Blockbuster?

46:20.599 --> 46:23.591
- Tell her Rita Miller.
- Rita Miller.

46:23.669 --> 46:26.604
So there really are people
out there to get us?

46:26.672 --> 46:29.232
Yes, there are, Zoe.
That's why I'm here.

46:29.308 --> 46:32.368
I think we're gonna need
a little more cooperation.

46:32.444 --> 46:35.902
From now on,
you listen to me...

46:35.981 --> 46:37.744
...and I'll listen to you too.

46:38.617 --> 46:40.244
Deal?

46:42.020 --> 46:44.181
- Relax. Relax.
- I'm relaxed.

46:44.289 --> 46:47.087
- If you just relax...
- I'm relaxed! I'm relaxed!

46:47.159 --> 46:50.094
You've got to relax!
Please, it's on the...

46:50.162 --> 46:51.993
Okay. I'm not
feeling well, here.

46:52.064 --> 46:54.794
- Oh, my God! There's a bee!
- There's no bee!

46:54.867 --> 46:57.427
- There's a bee!
- There's no bee! Stop! Please!

46:57.503 --> 46:59.266
[crashing]

46:59.338 --> 47:02.466
Okay, so she wrecked the car.
The insurance will pay for it.

47:02.541 --> 47:05.942
They were parallel parking.
The instructor jumped.

47:06.011 --> 47:08.912
But it's not about her.
It's about the boy.

47:08.981 --> 47:10.710
Has he been
skipping class again?

47:10.782 --> 47:13.774
Skipping class? He always
skips sixth period, but...

47:13.852 --> 47:14.910
All right. Seth!

47:18.023 --> 47:19.490
Okay, take off the hat.

47:20.692 --> 47:22.023
Go ahead.

47:24.963 --> 47:27.625
Look at that.
That's how he showed up for practice.

47:27.699 --> 47:31.726
I was doing a little recon in
his locker and I found this.

47:33.172 --> 47:34.696
Okay?

47:34.773 --> 47:38.800
[Murney] If it was a girlie
magazine or a hamster, fine.

47:38.877 --> 47:42.813
Boys will be boys.
But this is sick.

47:42.881 --> 47:45.008
All right. He dyed his hair.
He's not a Nazi.

47:45.083 --> 47:47.449
This is not normal.
We're very concerned.

47:47.553 --> 47:49.043
[bell rings]

47:49.154 --> 47:51.122
Why don't you get back to class?

47:51.223 --> 47:53.623
Mr. Murney, would you
give me a minute?

47:58.997 --> 48:01.124
Look, I'm sure this
is about their father.

48:01.200 --> 48:05.569
We've tried to get Seth and Zoe to talk
to the psychologist, but they won't.

48:05.637 --> 48:08.299
Maybe you can get through to them?
See what's going on?

48:08.373 --> 48:10.500
I'll talk to them
and see what I can do.

48:11.310 --> 48:13.039
Thanks.

48:15.380 --> 48:19.612
[Wolfe] Seth, I don't understand
unless you explain it to me.

48:19.685 --> 48:22.085
Why would you join wrestling
if you hate it?

48:22.187 --> 48:24.155
Because my father
wanted me to!

48:24.256 --> 48:27.657
Look, I know you're
just trying to help, but don't!

48:27.726 --> 48:29.921
I can take care of myself.

48:50.582 --> 48:53.278
Refrigerator magnet.

48:54.753 --> 48:57.153
Smart kid.

48:57.623 --> 48:59.750
Red One!

48:59.858 --> 49:04.522
You're in charge. Anyone gets within
40 clicks of the perimeter, signal me.

49:04.596 --> 49:08.032
Keep all doors sealed, do
your homework, preheat the oven

49:08.100 --> 49:11.297
and don't let Lulu
in the cookie jar.

49:41.600 --> 49:45.468
- [boy #1] Everything's ready?
- [boy #2] Yeah.

49:49.441 --> 49:50.999
[boy #3] Come on.

50:06.291 --> 50:10.421
All right. All my Nazis
are finally here.

50:10.495 --> 50:13.862
I want all of you
at attention!

50:13.932 --> 50:17.299
Okay, let's start
where we left off yesterday.

50:17.369 --> 50:19.428
[piano plays]

50:20.639 --> 50:24.336
# You are 16, going on 17

50:24.409 --> 50:27.970
# Baby, it's time to think

50:28.046 --> 50:31.277
# Better beware
Be canny and careful

50:31.350 --> 50:35.081
# Baby, you're on the brink

50:35.187 --> 50:38.418
# You are 16, going on 17

50:38.523 --> 50:41.890
# Fellows will fall in line

50:44.196 --> 50:46.323
[clears throat]

50:48.166 --> 50:50.600
[sighing]

50:56.007 --> 50:57.975
[sighs]

51:02.714 --> 51:06.047
We open in a week, people.
The set isn't finished.

51:06.118 --> 51:09.485
Mother Abbess just quit
because she got shingles!

51:09.588 --> 51:14.025
And every step-ball change would
make Bob Fosse rise from the grave

51:14.126 --> 51:16.720
just so he could have
a heart attack again!

51:16.795 --> 51:21.391
- I'm really sorry. I'll get it right.
- No, you won't, Seth.

51:21.466 --> 51:25.300
You and your mother
over here can't get it right.

51:25.370 --> 51:28.737
And I know this
because I am a professional.

51:28.807 --> 51:31.241
I directed Show Boat
with Greg Brady.

51:31.309 --> 51:33.607
It wasn't union,
but it was good.

51:40.986 --> 51:42.977
Obviously, I quit!

51:43.088 --> 51:47.821
Exeunt stage right!

51:50.262 --> 51:54.198
Seriously, Seth, if you drop me
again, I'm going to kill you.

51:54.266 --> 51:56.496
- Hi.
- Are you okay?

51:56.568 --> 51:58.468
I'm fine.

51:59.671 --> 52:01.161
Come on.

52:01.239 --> 52:03.332
I'm not gonna quit!

52:03.408 --> 52:07.401
- I don't expect you to understand...
- Hey...

52:07.479 --> 52:11.438
I may not understand a whole
hell of a lot about this kinda stuff,

52:11.516 --> 52:14.041
but I definitely
understand not quitting.

52:14.119 --> 52:17.213
And from what I see,
you're pretty good.

52:17.322 --> 52:20.450
A little discipline,
you could make a go of this.

52:20.559 --> 52:23.926
- But what about Murney?
- He's an all-talk spaz.

52:23.995 --> 52:26.463
So, The Sound of Music?

52:26.531 --> 52:29.466
- I saw it when I was a kid.
- Really?

52:29.534 --> 52:34.233
The idea of a nun ditching her
habit for a guy in the military.

52:34.306 --> 52:37.707
Nothing wrong with that.

52:37.776 --> 52:39.835
Do you think girls
will think I'm weird?

52:39.911 --> 52:42.812
They probably already do, Seth.

52:42.881 --> 52:45.145
But you'll kill 'em later.

52:47.252 --> 52:49.447
Come here.

52:49.554 --> 52:52.990
Forget about everyone else
for a second.

52:53.091 --> 52:56.356
Is performing
what makes you happy?

52:56.428 --> 52:58.896
Yeah,
more than anything.

53:00.932 --> 53:03.924
All right, fall in.

53:04.002 --> 53:06.766
Company. Center stage.

53:09.608 --> 53:12.304
Company! Center stage!

53:12.377 --> 53:15.244
Who is this guy?

53:15.313 --> 53:20.683
Now, do you or do you not have
what it takes to perform this musical?

53:20.752 --> 53:24.552
- We don't have a director.
- I've directed rescue missions

53:24.656 --> 53:27.090
all around the world.

53:27.158 --> 53:30.184
I've directed numerous
snatch-and-grabs

53:30.295 --> 53:35.028
from countries whose names
you are not allowed to know.

53:35.100 --> 53:39.799
I've choreographed
multi-pronged amphibious landings

53:39.871 --> 53:42.396
and stealth air attacks!

53:42.474 --> 53:47.605
Do you think I have
the military proficiency...

53:47.679 --> 53:50.739
...to direct this production?

53:50.815 --> 53:52.282
Yes.

53:52.350 --> 53:55.217
- Yes, what?
- [all] Yes, sir!

53:55.320 --> 53:55.420
[Wolfe] Once upon a time,
there was a family...

53:55.420 --> 53:58.287
[Wolfe] Once upon a time,
there was a family...

53:58.390 --> 54:00.119
...of elves.

54:00.191 --> 54:05.390
And one day the little elf family

54:05.463 --> 54:08.796
went into the magic forest

54:08.867 --> 54:12.098
to find a secret...

54:12.170 --> 54:14.229
...gnome...

54:14.306 --> 54:15.671
...facility,

54:15.740 --> 54:21.610
where the gnomes were
turning mushrooms into uranium.

54:21.680 --> 54:27.619
So three elves laid down heavy
suppressive fire on the gnomes

54:27.686 --> 54:33.056
while the others maneuvered
around to the right flank,

54:33.124 --> 54:37.458
finishing off anything left alive.

54:37.529 --> 54:40.327
[sighs]

54:40.398 --> 54:45.700
And not one of those elves
were left behind that day.

54:45.770 --> 54:47.931
We got 'em all.

54:51.076 --> 54:54.273
Even the teeniest...

54:54.346 --> 54:58.282
...littlest elf of all...

54:58.350 --> 55:00.614
...Rodriguez.

55:00.685 --> 55:04.212
You're gonna have to do
the Panda dance or he won't stop.

55:04.322 --> 55:06.813
- Oh, come on...
- [baby crying]

55:06.925 --> 55:09.052
I don't know how to do
the Panda dance.

55:09.160 --> 55:11.628
I'll write it down for you.

55:11.730 --> 55:14.722
Close your eyes. Go to sleep.
I'll be right back.

55:14.799 --> 55:17.563
You gotta do the dance.

55:17.636 --> 55:21.766
Like Dad used to do.
He made it up for him.

55:21.840 --> 55:24.502
[Seth] You have to do the dance
to make him sleep.

55:25.076 --> 55:28.477
Come on.

55:28.546 --> 55:33.916
# When you're down and low
Lower than the floor

55:33.985 --> 55:39.321
# And you think that you
ain't got a chance, bum, bum

55:39.391 --> 55:43.191
# Don't make a move
till you're in the groove

55:43.261 --> 55:45.752
- Lulu.
- Thank you.

55:45.864 --> 55:48.094
Seth.

55:48.166 --> 55:49.827
Zoe. Uh!

55:49.901 --> 55:51.801
Today you drive.

55:51.870 --> 55:54.998
But I can't even
pass Driver's Ed.

55:55.073 --> 55:57.268
Exactly.

56:01.079 --> 56:03.104
We're all gonna die.

56:04.349 --> 56:06.909
Have you ever given
a driving lesson before?

56:06.985 --> 56:08.680
In a minivan? No.

56:08.787 --> 56:11.187
Think of it like
a Bradley Assault Vehicle.

56:11.256 --> 56:12.814
Especially when Zoe's driving.

56:15.794 --> 56:18.024
- [gasps]
- [tires screeching]

56:18.096 --> 56:20.997
- [Lulu] Zoe Plummer!
- [Seth] Zoe, what are you doing?

56:21.066 --> 56:23.557
- [Seth] What are...? Slow down!
- [Lulu] Truck!

56:23.635 --> 56:25.569
[screaming]

56:30.442 --> 56:32.910
- [Wolfe] Whoa! Whoa!
- [tires screeching]

56:32.977 --> 56:35.844
- [Lulu] Whoa!
- [Wolfe] Not bad.

56:39.217 --> 56:42.311
Land! Solid land!

56:42.420 --> 56:46.379
- I think it went well.
- Oh, it's so dramatic.

56:47.859 --> 56:50.327
Hey, hey, hey. No fighting.

56:50.428 --> 56:52.089
- Play nicely.
- [boy] Sorry.

56:52.163 --> 56:54.791
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?

56:54.866 --> 56:59.132
I have noticed an improvement in the
Plummer kids and I'm very impressed.

56:59.237 --> 57:02.229
Yeah, you know,
they're just misunderstood.

57:02.273 --> 57:04.867
[Wolfe] Peter, careful!
Don't make me come up there!

57:04.943 --> 57:07.639
Someone needs to take the time
to talk to 'em.

57:07.712 --> 57:12.046
- You're getting a little attached.
- I take my job very seriously.

57:12.817 --> 57:16.014
But it's like you said.
They're just kids.

57:16.121 --> 57:20.285
Well, keep up the good work.

57:21.059 --> 57:23.755
Oh!

57:23.828 --> 57:26.194
You look very nice today.

57:26.865 --> 57:31.199
Oh. Thanks.

57:31.269 --> 57:34.796
I don't think you understand.
Don't you ever do that again.

57:34.873 --> 57:37.307
Is that clear?
Okay, I've had it.

57:37.375 --> 57:41.471
I caught the kid dancing to no music.
I want him out of my class.

57:41.546 --> 57:44.447
Somebody's gotta give this punk
a talking to.

57:44.516 --> 57:47.246
Seth?

57:47.318 --> 57:50.185
Well, you got something
to say, twinkle toes?

57:51.856 --> 57:54.324
Yeah. Yeah, I do, Murney.

57:54.392 --> 57:56.587
- I quit.
- You quit.

57:56.661 --> 57:59.653
You know why you quit?
Because you're a quitter.

57:59.731 --> 58:02.632
And everybody knows
that quitters...

58:02.700 --> 58:04.167
...quit.

58:07.005 --> 58:08.905
What are you scared of, Prancer?

58:08.973 --> 58:13.069
- I'm not scared. I want to act.
- And I want to take up origami.

58:13.144 --> 58:16.511
- I'm in The Sound of Music.
- Oh. A musical.

58:16.581 --> 58:19.243
You're giving up wrestling
to be in a musical.

58:19.317 --> 58:21.979
That happens when there
isn't a man in the house.

58:22.086 --> 58:25.954
There is a man
in the house. It's me.

58:26.024 --> 58:29.983
[laughing] Well,
it's gotta be a tiny house.

58:33.898 --> 58:36.389
You think you're tough, boy,
don't you?

58:37.602 --> 58:40.070
Wanna shave the tiger?
Do you? Huh?

58:40.138 --> 58:42.971
- You want it tough?
- Where did you wanna do this?

58:43.041 --> 58:47.171
- What are you talking about?
- You said you wanted to wrestle.

58:47.245 --> 58:49.406
Where? When?

58:50.982 --> 58:53.041
- After school.
- [Wolfe] Okay.

58:54.018 --> 58:58.079
- Today?
- That's right. The gym.

58:58.189 --> 58:59.713
Okay?

58:59.824 --> 59:04.454
Remember. You mess with
the bull, you get the horns.

59:04.529 --> 59:06.895
[snorting]

59:13.771 --> 59:15.602
[Murney] Out of my way!

59:17.675 --> 59:20.508
- How did that feel?
- It was good.

59:24.716 --> 59:28.516
[boy] Murney is getting
his butt kicked at 3:00!

59:28.620 --> 59:31.248
[cheering, pounding bleachers]

59:36.594 --> 59:38.824
Oh, that is so gross.

59:38.897 --> 59:42.298
[Murney] Come on! Come on!

59:42.367 --> 59:45.768
What? That's it!

59:45.837 --> 59:49.364
Someone's gonna get hurt today
and you know who it is?

59:56.347 --> 01:00:00.943
You're about to enter
Murney's House of Pain!

01:00:01.019 --> 01:00:06.082
What do you say we go over
the rules, cue ball? Huh?

01:00:07.025 --> 01:00:08.959
[crowd] Oooh!

01:00:09.027 --> 01:00:11.393
Rule number one.

01:00:11.462 --> 01:00:15.728
Never be too eager
to rush your opponent.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:20.601
Wanna play prison rules, frogman?
Wanna play prison rules? You got it.

01:00:20.672 --> 01:00:23.698
- I'll be your daddy.
- [crowd cheering]

01:00:26.377 --> 01:00:29.005
- [cracking]
- Ah!

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:31.913
All right.
Now you've unlocked the beast.

01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:34.308
Oh, God!

01:00:34.385 --> 01:00:37.115
From this position,
it's relatively easy

01:00:37.221 --> 01:00:40.782
- to manipulate your opponent.
- Ohhh!

01:00:40.892 --> 01:00:42.189
[groaning]

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:44.524
And thus we have
the chicken wing.

01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:48.021
The chicken wing. [screams]

01:00:48.099 --> 01:00:49.828
The arm bar.

01:00:51.502 --> 01:00:54.335
The crow bar.
Or my personal favorite...

01:00:54.405 --> 01:00:58.239
- Ahhhh!
...the pacifier!

01:01:08.219 --> 01:01:10.312
Any questions?

01:01:10.421 --> 01:01:12.616
Anything you
didn't understand?

01:01:13.691 --> 01:01:15.682
Ah. The nipple crippler.

01:01:15.793 --> 01:01:19.695
This is a useless, not to mention,
shameless move

01:01:19.764 --> 01:01:23.757
that ultimately is a sure sign
of desperation.

01:01:28.272 --> 01:01:30.001
And finally...

01:01:35.279 --> 01:01:37.372
Pinned!

01:01:38.516 --> 01:01:40.609
That was awesome!

01:01:43.254 --> 01:01:46.451
- Are you okay, Murney?
- Get away from me!

01:01:48.126 --> 01:01:51.755
Can I get a little help, please?
I can't move my back. Watch the back!

01:02:10.214 --> 01:02:11.977
Go!

01:02:17.355 --> 01:02:19.016
Sorry!

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.923
I didn't get that cone!

01:02:35.206 --> 01:02:36.935
Crawl!

01:02:47.852 --> 01:02:49.410
[beeping]

01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:54.858
See? But he usually
breaks down the door.

01:03:20.118 --> 01:03:21.608
[tires screech]

01:03:21.686 --> 01:03:25.588
Excellent!
Now do it backwards.

01:03:36.501 --> 01:03:38.662
Okay.

01:03:38.736 --> 01:03:43.696
# When you're down and low
Lower than the floor

01:03:43.774 --> 01:03:48.541
# And you feel like you
ain't got a chance

01:03:48.613 --> 01:03:52.447
# Don't make a move
till you're in the groove

01:03:52.517 --> 01:03:55.975
# And do the
Peter Panda dance

01:03:56.053 --> 01:03:59.921
# Just hop three times
like a kangaroo

01:04:00.024 --> 01:04:04.324
# Side-step twice
just like the crabs do

01:04:04.362 --> 01:04:08.093
# Three steps forward
One step back

01:04:08.166 --> 01:04:12.933
# And quick like a turtle
Lie on your back

01:04:13.004 --> 01:04:17.031
# Roll like a log
till you can't roll no more

01:04:17.108 --> 01:04:21.204
# Betterjump quick
like there ain't no floor

01:04:21.279 --> 01:04:25.340
# Hold your breath
Jump to the left

01:04:25.416 --> 01:04:29.284
# And that's the Peter
I swear that's the Peter

01:04:29.387 --> 01:04:33.187
# That's the
Peter Panda dance #

01:04:33.257 --> 01:04:34.884
[Tyler coos]

01:04:34.992 --> 01:04:37.426
- Again.
- Again?

01:04:37.495 --> 01:04:40.760
You're going to sleep.
Good night, Peter Panda.

01:04:40.831 --> 01:04:42.594
Good night, Daddy.

01:04:50.908 --> 01:04:53.502
Good night, little fella.

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:57.973
Good night.

01:05:07.258 --> 01:05:11.160
Hey, Skeever, what do you put in a jar
and shake till they're dead?

01:05:11.229 --> 01:05:13.459
Fireflies?

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:19.634
Go away
and we won't hurt you.

01:05:25.276 --> 01:05:26.675
[girls give karate yell]

01:05:26.744 --> 01:05:31.147
[shouting]

01:05:31.215 --> 01:05:32.739
Hiya!

01:05:37.822 --> 01:05:39.949
Don't even think about it.

01:05:59.076 --> 01:06:00.236
Cookie!

01:06:01.312 --> 01:06:04.042
Eat it, you jerk!

01:06:04.115 --> 01:06:06.583
Go get 'em!

01:06:06.651 --> 01:06:07.879
[phone ringing]

01:06:07.952 --> 01:06:10.716
Customer service.

01:06:17.662 --> 01:06:18.822
[moaning]

01:06:18.896 --> 01:06:21.421
From now on, you do things our way!

01:06:21.499 --> 01:06:23.228
No highway option!

01:06:23.301 --> 01:06:26.395
- Ah!
- [moaning]

01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:30.998
# I don't care what has been said
Fireflies rock full speed ahead

01:06:31.075 --> 01:06:35.603
# Give me guff, I'm in your face
Fireflies rule the human race

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:39.013
- # Sound off
- # One-two, three-four

01:06:39.083 --> 01:06:41.381
# One-two... three-four! #

01:06:41.452 --> 01:06:43.477
[cheering]

01:06:43.587 --> 01:06:46.181
- [Julie] Gary the duck?
- [man #1] No.

01:06:46.290 --> 01:06:48.281
[man #2] We've been
here two weeks.

01:06:48.392 --> 01:06:50.656
This is a matter of national security.

01:06:50.728 --> 01:06:54.824
Well, I am sorry, sir, but none
of these answers ring true.

01:07:00.171 --> 01:07:04.005
Howard. I'm so stupid.

01:07:05.676 --> 01:07:07.837
Is it "my angel"?

01:07:08.779 --> 01:07:10.679
Yes, it is indeed.

01:07:16.454 --> 01:07:19.719
Well, I'll leave you to your business.

01:07:25.262 --> 01:07:28.459
Please, Howard,
no more surprises.

01:07:49.153 --> 01:07:53.146
Zoe, a rookie sniper
could drop you like a deer.

01:07:53.257 --> 01:07:56.693
- Good.
- Good?

01:07:56.761 --> 01:07:59.525
All right,
this is about Scott again.

01:07:59.597 --> 01:08:02.566
No, it's not.

01:08:02.633 --> 01:08:07.764
You were right about him.
Stupid guy.

01:08:07.838 --> 01:08:11.330
- So, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:08:12.243 --> 01:08:15.770
Nothing. Okay.

01:08:24.654 --> 01:08:28.819
You know, when I was little,
my mom left.

01:08:28.926 --> 01:08:33.828
My dad was a spec ops soldier like me.

01:08:33.898 --> 01:08:39.894
When I was eight, he shipped
me off to military school.

01:08:45.843 --> 01:08:49.609
I guess he liked being a soldier
more than he liked being a dad.

01:08:51.314 --> 01:08:54.443
One day, I get a letter.

01:08:54.518 --> 01:08:57.078
No more dad.

01:08:58.154 --> 01:09:00.282
That's terrible.

01:09:02.126 --> 01:09:06.586
For a long time I thought if I talked
about it, I was letting him down.

01:09:06.663 --> 01:09:10.532
Like I was supposed to be brave
or something.

01:09:13.069 --> 01:09:15.368
Yeah.

01:09:19.076 --> 01:09:22.443
It's okay to talk
about your dad, Zoe.

01:09:24.615 --> 01:09:29.245
I do miss him so much.

01:09:31.589 --> 01:09:33.783
I don't know, I just...

01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:37.189
I wanna be strong for Lulu
and Tyler and Peter

01:09:37.261 --> 01:09:39.821
and Seth and my mom.

01:09:39.897 --> 01:09:42.832
That's such
a big burden to carry.

01:09:45.736 --> 01:09:48.170
I know.

01:09:50.006 --> 01:09:52.908
[sobbing] I miss him so much.

01:09:52.977 --> 01:09:56.140
It's okay to miss your dad.

01:10:00.117 --> 01:10:03.553
- [phone rings]
- [Wolfe] I'll get it.

01:10:03.654 --> 01:10:05.246
- Really?
- Yes.

01:10:05.356 --> 01:10:07.722
- Really?
- Yes.

01:10:07.791 --> 01:10:11.090
Seth! Seth! Guess what?
Mom's coming home.

01:10:11.161 --> 01:10:14.460
- When?
- Tomorrow! She's coming home tomorrow!

01:10:14.532 --> 01:10:16.659
- When did you talk?
- Mommy's coming.

01:10:16.734 --> 01:10:18.895
Here, buddy,
Mommy's coming home!

01:10:18.969 --> 01:10:20.231
Mom's coming home!

01:10:20.304 --> 01:10:21.862
[Lulu] She is?

01:10:21.939 --> 01:10:23.429
[Seth] She's coming back.

01:10:23.507 --> 01:10:26.340
[excited chattering]

01:10:26.410 --> 01:10:28.571
[Seth] Peter,
aren't you excited?

01:10:28.646 --> 01:10:34.107
- When's she gonna be here?
- [Zoe] So, what are we gonna do?

01:10:34.184 --> 01:10:37.711
We should dress up nice.
We should make her something.

01:10:37.821 --> 01:10:40.984
- We'll clean up the entire house.
- That's a good idea.

01:10:41.091 --> 01:10:44.720
- [Zoe] We should make a banner too.
- [Lulu] In the family room.

01:10:48.299 --> 01:10:50.859
[quacking]

01:11:00.411 --> 01:11:02.140
[quacking]

01:11:03.614 --> 01:11:06.777
What's wrong, Gary?
Foot got stuck?

01:11:08.052 --> 01:11:10.816
Hang on, hang on.

01:11:12.222 --> 01:11:15.214
Okay, now just stay still.

01:11:36.513 --> 01:11:38.947
Hi. Come on in.

01:11:40.517 --> 01:11:42.576
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, almost.

01:11:42.686 --> 01:11:44.313
[phone dialing]

01:11:46.290 --> 01:11:48.554
[phone rings]

01:11:48.626 --> 01:11:50.491
- Yes?
- Hey, it's Shane.

01:11:50.561 --> 01:11:53.029
I have excellent news.
I think I found GHOST.

01:11:53.130 --> 01:11:55.291
- Do you have it?
- It's in a steel vault.

01:11:55.366 --> 01:11:59.860
It needs some sort of two-pronged key.
I've been working on it, but it's tough.

01:11:59.970 --> 01:12:02.370
Great. Good work.
We're on our way.

01:12:02.406 --> 01:12:05.432
Don't do anything further.
I'll be there soon.

01:12:05.509 --> 01:12:07.067
Yes, sir.

01:12:10.047 --> 01:12:11.742
Ready?

01:12:11.815 --> 01:12:14.841
The good news is,
once I give this to my C.O.,

01:12:14.918 --> 01:12:17.751
whoever's been bothering you
ain't gonna be.

01:12:17.855 --> 01:12:19.823
- Really?
- Really.

01:12:19.923 --> 01:12:24.189
What's wrong? Your mother's
coming. You should be happy.

01:12:24.261 --> 01:12:27.162
But, Shane, doesn't that
mean you have to go?

01:12:28.565 --> 01:12:31.363
You should get ready.
Your mother will be home soon.

01:12:49.386 --> 01:12:53.254
I had a fight with Zoe before I left,
so they probably trashed the place.

01:13:40.771 --> 01:13:42.238
Welcome home, Mom.

01:13:44.141 --> 01:13:48.202
[Julie] Hi! I missed you!

01:13:48.278 --> 01:13:50.269
Guy!

01:13:56.854 --> 01:14:00.085
Shane, I am so proud of you.
I truly am.

01:14:00.190 --> 01:14:03.057
I am going to give you
your choice of assignment.

01:14:03.127 --> 01:14:07.393
Anywhere you want to go,
you just name it.

01:14:07.464 --> 01:14:10.228
Well, I appreciate that.

01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:13.064
But I'll have to think about it.

01:14:14.338 --> 01:14:15.999
You're gonna think about it?

01:14:16.073 --> 01:14:19.042
Well, the military's
all I've ever known.

01:14:19.109 --> 01:14:22.044
- I have no regrets.
- I should hope not.

01:14:22.112 --> 01:14:24.546
It's just that being
with this family...

01:14:24.615 --> 01:14:26.879
- I've never had a...
- [man] Put your hands up!

01:14:29.853 --> 01:14:31.411
The Chuns?

01:14:32.956 --> 01:14:35.789
You gotta be kidding.
I swear I checked them out.

01:14:35.859 --> 01:14:38.089
Give us the key.

01:14:38.162 --> 01:14:42.826
- [man] Put your hands up!
- Okay. All right.

01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:44.765
Here.

01:14:45.569 --> 01:14:47.264
Now!

01:14:53.477 --> 01:14:55.536
You promised us GHOST
months ago!

01:14:55.612 --> 01:14:58.638
Well, I'm sorry.
There were delays.

01:14:58.749 --> 01:15:00.307
Shane!

01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:02.250
Stop talking.

01:15:02.319 --> 01:15:05.652
Shane's not gonna be
babysitting you anymore.

01:15:05.756 --> 01:15:09.317
I trusted you.
Howard trusted you.

01:15:09.426 --> 01:15:14.454
You've betrayed us
and you've betrayed this country.

01:15:14.531 --> 01:15:17.432
Guess what?
North Korea pays better.

01:15:17.501 --> 01:15:20.698
Chun, watch them.
They're squirmy.

01:15:21.605 --> 01:15:24.597
You two, come with me.

01:15:24.675 --> 01:15:27.109
[muffled yelling]

01:15:47.097 --> 01:15:49.725
[beeping, bolts releasing]

01:16:01.778 --> 01:16:04.770
Did you bring the
stethoscope, Mrs. Chun?

01:16:04.848 --> 01:16:07.544
No, but I've
got some C-4.

01:16:17.027 --> 01:16:19.655
I just had my eyebrows done.

01:16:34.177 --> 01:16:36.304
[crying]

01:16:42.185 --> 01:16:43.982
Quiet!

01:16:49.393 --> 01:16:51.759
I said "Quiet,"
you little bug!

01:16:54.898 --> 01:16:56.422
Now, Peter!

01:16:56.533 --> 01:16:57.522
Ah!

01:17:05.242 --> 01:17:06.402
Hiya!

01:17:06.476 --> 01:17:08.467
Well, that's cute!
[groans]

01:17:32.636 --> 01:17:34.501
That stuff doesn't hurt!

01:17:39.109 --> 01:17:42.272
[Lulu] Shane! You can't do this!
You can't leave a man behind!

01:17:42.346 --> 01:17:43.938
Hold on, I got it.

01:17:45.082 --> 01:17:46.310
[Zoe] Shane!

01:17:46.383 --> 01:17:48.817
- Where's Mom?
- Mom?

01:17:48.885 --> 01:17:50.876
I'll find her.
You guys run and get help!

01:17:50.954 --> 01:17:53.388
- [crying]
- Hurry!

01:17:53.457 --> 01:17:55.357
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

01:17:55.425 --> 01:17:57.620
Yes, Lulu. Go, get help.

01:18:02.799 --> 01:18:04.096
Hold on!

01:18:04.167 --> 01:18:05.759
[speaking in foreign language]

01:18:05.836 --> 01:18:08.168
They're headed for the car!

01:18:08.238 --> 01:18:11.264
- [Lulu] Zoe, call 911.
- I forgot my cell phone.

01:18:11.341 --> 01:18:15.141
- [Seth] Great. The only time you don't.
- [Zoe] We're gonna be okay!

01:18:26.023 --> 01:18:27.991
Oh, my God!
What do we do?

01:18:28.058 --> 01:18:29.252
Find a cop!

01:18:39.069 --> 01:18:40.127
Ahh!

01:18:40.203 --> 01:18:42.501
[screaming]

01:18:52.549 --> 01:18:54.813
- He's gaining on us.
- I'll handle it.

01:18:57.587 --> 01:18:58.554
[screaming]

01:19:00.624 --> 01:19:02.319
[Chun yelling]

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:04.527
[screaming]

01:19:18.909 --> 01:19:21.173
[yelling]

01:19:21.244 --> 01:19:23.678
Look, Zoe! It's the cops!

01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:28.941
[siren wails]

01:19:32.422 --> 01:19:35.448
I assume you heard the Baloney
Bandit has struck again.

01:19:35.559 --> 01:19:40.724
I accept total responsibility.
My intelligence, well, it was faulty.

01:19:40.797 --> 01:19:43.493
- If I had better resources...
- [siren wails]

01:19:53.343 --> 01:19:57.074
I told you not to pass her
in Driver's Ed.

01:19:57.147 --> 01:19:57.247
You have exactly three seconds
to get me through this mine field.

01:19:57.247 --> 01:20:00.842
You have exactly three seconds
to get me through this mine field.

01:20:00.917 --> 01:20:04.785
- One, two...
- [Wolfe] Bill.

01:20:04.888 --> 01:20:07.356
She doesn't know.

01:20:07.424 --> 01:20:10.689
And you're not taking another
parent away from those kids.

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:13.228
Leave the family alone
and I'll get you in.

01:20:13.296 --> 01:20:14.820
You better not be bluffing.

01:20:20.937 --> 01:20:23.497
Zoe! Seth!

01:20:23.573 --> 01:20:27.407
Lulu! Peter! Tyler!

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:32.007
Ah!

01:20:32.082 --> 01:20:35.518
That was the code. I saw Mr. Plummer
use it to open the briefcase.

01:20:35.585 --> 01:20:40.545
You think this is a game?
Code or no code, open it. Now.

01:20:40.657 --> 01:20:42.522
You can't make him do this.

01:20:42.592 --> 01:20:45.925
I know Howard.
You haven't got a chance.

01:20:51.134 --> 01:20:56.504
# When you're down and low
Lower than the floor

01:20:56.573 --> 01:21:01.977
# And you feel like you
don't have a chance

01:21:04.281 --> 01:21:08.615
# Don't make a move
till you're in the groove

01:21:08.685 --> 01:21:13.281
# And do the
Peter Panda dance

01:21:13.390 --> 01:21:17.759
# Hop three times
like a kangaroo

01:21:17.827 --> 01:21:22.662
# Side-step twice
just like the crabs do

01:21:22.732 --> 01:21:26.031
# Three steps forward
One step back

01:21:26.102 --> 01:21:29.299
Quick like a turtle!
Lie on your back!

01:21:29.372 --> 01:21:32.500
# Roll like a log
till you can't no more

01:21:32.576 --> 01:21:35.943
# Betterjump quick
like there ain't no floor

01:21:37.981 --> 01:21:43.146
# Hold your breath
Step to the left

01:21:52.329 --> 01:21:55.856
And that's
the Peter Panda dance.

01:21:55.932 --> 01:21:58.992
All right. Go.

01:21:59.102 --> 01:22:01.900
Yeah, right.

01:22:01.938 --> 01:22:03.997
Okay, I'll go first.

01:22:13.316 --> 01:22:16.046
Great work, Shane.
I knew you'd figure it out.

01:22:16.119 --> 01:22:19.213
I think you'd better open it.

01:22:22.993 --> 01:22:24.551
Wait, wait, wait!

01:22:24.661 --> 01:22:26.925
Back away.

01:22:28.832 --> 01:22:30.800
You open it.

01:22:30.867 --> 01:22:33.267
Come on.
I walked the floor first.

01:22:33.336 --> 01:22:35.497
No way.
You can do it, soldier man.

01:22:36.172 --> 01:22:37.264
[Julie] Ah!

01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:39.308
[grunting]

01:22:54.758 --> 01:22:56.350
Ahhh!

01:23:06.002 --> 01:23:07.799
[panting]

01:23:09.506 --> 01:23:11.337
Any last words, Shane?

01:23:11.408 --> 01:23:13.467
Say good night,
Peter Panda.

01:23:22.085 --> 01:23:24.246
Shane, are you okay?

01:23:24.354 --> 01:23:26.083
Oh!

01:23:28.024 --> 01:23:30.925
She was never
a good neighbor.

01:24:01.524 --> 01:24:03.583
Zoe, you're going too fast!

01:24:03.693 --> 01:24:05.661
You're not gonna
have time to stop!

01:24:05.762 --> 01:24:09.129
Who said anything about
stopping? I'm parking.

01:24:09.199 --> 01:24:10.996
[tires screeching]

01:24:22.579 --> 01:24:26.572
- What are you doing to these kids?
- [cop] Hands where I can see them!

01:24:26.649 --> 01:24:28.879
[Wolfe] Okay. Calm down.

01:24:28.952 --> 01:24:31.182
Everybody!
Put your weapons down!

01:24:34.057 --> 01:24:36.025
I want the GHOST.

01:24:36.092 --> 01:24:38.322
[quacking]

01:24:42.932 --> 01:24:47.232
[Wolfe] Um... Calm down.
It's just a duck.

01:24:47.303 --> 01:24:49.601
- [Chun] Where's the GHOST?
- [Wolfe] I have it.

01:24:51.708 --> 01:24:53.073
[Chun] Bring it here!

01:24:58.715 --> 01:25:00.114
Put it on the ground.

01:25:05.688 --> 01:25:08.316
[whispering] Now, Gary.
Go for his balls.

01:25:08.425 --> 01:25:12.054
Okay, duck whisperer,
step away!

01:25:18.301 --> 01:25:20.030
- Gary, now!
- [quacking]

01:25:20.103 --> 01:25:21.502
Ah!

01:25:28.144 --> 01:25:30.339
Couldn't let you
have all the fun.

01:25:40.423 --> 01:25:43.324
So I guess you'll be
taking off now, huh?

01:25:43.393 --> 01:25:48.092
Seeing as there's no reason
to stick around anymore.

01:25:48.164 --> 01:25:51.031
I'm still here,
aren't I?

01:25:52.202 --> 01:25:54.102
Yeah.

01:25:56.072 --> 01:26:00.566
- What now?
- I don't know. I'm on dry land.

01:26:00.677 --> 01:26:02.304
True.

01:26:02.345 --> 01:26:04.870
Which means you're
the superior officer.

01:26:04.948 --> 01:26:06.848
True.

01:26:06.916 --> 01:26:08.816
So you tell me.

01:26:11.688 --> 01:26:12.677
Um...

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:18.787
- [clears throat]
- Lulu!

01:26:18.862 --> 01:26:21.194
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could I have a few words?

01:26:21.264 --> 01:26:23.027
Sure.

01:26:23.099 --> 01:26:24.794
Well, we... I... You know.

01:26:26.035 --> 01:26:27.468
Oh.

01:26:29.105 --> 01:26:31.767
We'll talk later.

01:26:31.841 --> 01:26:35.709
- Mission accomplished, soldier.
- I suppose it is.

01:26:35.778 --> 01:26:40.306
- I guess you'll be leaving us now.
- I guess so.

01:26:41.851 --> 01:26:44.342
I want you to have this.

01:26:48.024 --> 01:26:50.515
Because I don't want you
ever to forget me.

01:26:54.030 --> 01:26:56.726
I will never forget you.

01:26:59.202 --> 01:27:01.602
'Cause you're the
best friend I ever had.

01:27:01.671 --> 01:27:05.072
No matter how far...

01:27:05.141 --> 01:27:07.939
...or long life takes me away,

01:27:08.011 --> 01:27:10.912
I will always be thinking about you.

01:27:12.982 --> 01:27:15.212
I love you, Shane.

01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:18.979
I love you too.

01:27:27.964 --> 01:27:31.866
From now on, it's your command.

01:27:34.771 --> 01:27:36.830
At ease, soldiers.

01:27:36.906 --> 01:27:40.740
[Wolfe] Your father would
be so proud of all of you.

01:27:44.347 --> 01:27:45.507
Awww.

01:27:45.582 --> 01:27:47.243
Look who just woke up.

01:27:48.051 --> 01:27:50.076
- [Lulu] Shane?
- Yes?

01:27:50.153 --> 01:27:54.214
- Are we ever gonna see you again?
- What are you talking about?

01:27:54.324 --> 01:27:56.792
We still have one more mission.

01:27:56.926 --> 01:28:00.760
# You are 16, going on 17

01:28:00.797 --> 01:28:04.233
# Baby, it's time to think

01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:07.326
# Better beware
Be canny and careful

01:28:07.403 --> 01:28:11.066
# Baby, you're on the brink

01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:14.234
# You are 16, going on 17

01:28:14.310 --> 01:28:18.041
# Fellows will fall in line

01:28:18.114 --> 01:28:21.083
- # Eager young lads
- Yes!

01:28:21.150 --> 01:28:25.177
# Will offer
you food and wine

01:28:25.288 --> 01:28:29.156
# Climb every mountain

01:28:29.225 --> 01:28:34.561
# Ford every stream

01:28:34.631 --> 01:28:37.930
Looks like you have
a hit on your hands.

01:28:38.001 --> 01:28:40.128
- You think so?
- Mm-hmm.

01:28:40.203 --> 01:28:44.071
You should take over the drama
department instead of wrestling.

01:28:45.341 --> 01:28:48.310
It's gonna be nice
having you around now.

01:28:48.378 --> 01:28:50.903
Now that Murney's found
his true calling.

01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:53.972
# Climb every mountain

01:28:54.050 --> 01:28:59.010
# Ford every stream

01:28:59.122 --> 01:29:02.580
It's gonna be my pleasure
serving with you.

01:29:06.029 --> 01:29:11.763
# Find your dream #
