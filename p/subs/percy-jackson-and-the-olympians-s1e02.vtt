00:01.208 --> 00:04.333
<i>Did you see it?
Did you see what happened to my mom?</i>

00:04.958 --> 00:07.333
Wait, so this is the kid
who killed the Minotaur.

00:07.333 --> 00:10.208
<i>I know you feel powerless,</i>

00:10.208 --> 00:11.458
<i>but you're not.</i>

00:11.916 --> 00:13.791
<i>All will reveal itself in time.</i>

00:14.458 --> 00:15.458
<i>I'm Annabeth.</i>

00:15.458 --> 00:16.833
<i>Annabeth sees
the world differently.</i>

00:16.833 --> 00:18.416
<i>Always six steps ahead of everyone else.</i>

00:18.416 --> 00:21.125
<i>Chiron's been promising her for years
a demigod would arrive</i>

00:21.416 --> 00:24.125
<i>who was fated to go on a quest
that even Chiron couldn't prevent.</i>

00:24.958 --> 00:27.375
<i>You have been claimed
by Poseidon.</i>

00:27.791 --> 00:29.750
<i>Your father needs your help.</i>

00:29.875 --> 00:35.625
<i>An ultimatum has been given to him by Zeus
that if he doesn't return the master bolt,</i>

00:35.625 --> 00:36.708
there will be war.

00:37.333 --> 00:38.333
<i>Your mother was stolen...</i>

00:38.541 --> 00:39.583
by Hades.

00:40.041 --> 00:43.541
If you can find her there,
I think you can bring her back.

00:44.958 --> 00:45.958
When do we leave?

01:45.333 --> 01:48.708
Hi. I’m Percy. It's nice to meet you.

01:54.833 --> 01:58.750
I was told a quest isn’t a quest
until you’ve said so?

02:01.500 --> 02:05.333
Which is weird considering
you're a Halloween decoration.

02:07.875 --> 02:09.083
Oh, geez.

02:14.666 --> 02:16.791
You seem busy. I’ll come back.

02:31.958 --> 02:32.958
Whoa.

02:38.291 --> 02:41.875
Come on, really?

02:42.500 --> 02:47.541
You shall go west
and face the god who has turned.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.250
And you shall find what was stolen
and see it safely returned.

02:57.375 --> 03:00.125
The Oracle has confirmed
what we expected,

03:00.666 --> 03:04.875
that this quest will proceed
toward the Underworld,

03:05.916 --> 03:09.708
where you will confront the god
who has rebelled against his brothers.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.375
Hades.

03:13.041 --> 03:17.375
The entrance to Hades's domain
lies under the city of Los Angeles.

03:17.541 --> 03:19.833
This is where you will journey to.

03:20.583 --> 03:21.750
Time is short.

03:22.875 --> 03:25.875
I have selected
our most compelling candidates,

03:25.875 --> 03:29.458
from which you will choose two
to join you on this quest

03:29.875 --> 03:31.000
and ensure

03:31.125 --> 03:33.000
- that we succeed.
- Annabeth.

03:37.791 --> 03:42.208
Customarily, one waits to at least hear
a name or two before choosing.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.583
Are you sure you don't wanna hear more?

03:47.416 --> 03:50.125
This thing, Zeus’s master bolt,

03:51.000 --> 03:52.250
we need to get it back, right?

03:53.125 --> 03:55.875
- Yes.
- And it’s gonna be hard to get, yes?

03:56.750 --> 03:57.875
Extraordinarily.

03:57.875 --> 04:00.125
And if the mission required someone
to push me down

04:00.125 --> 04:02.041
a flight of stairs for it to succeed...

04:03.125 --> 04:05.291
you'd want someone
who won’t hesitate when they do it.

04:08.666 --> 04:11.583
The first quest-mate
shall be Annabeth Chase!

04:14.708 --> 04:16.791
Now, on to the other candidates.

04:23.166 --> 04:27.083
Dude, what have you been eating?

04:28.291 --> 04:31.083
Whoa! Wait, hey.
I’m not trying to antagonize you.

04:31.250 --> 04:32.541
I’m just genuinely curious.

04:42.291 --> 04:43.291
Hey.

04:44.833 --> 04:45.833
Hey.

04:46.625 --> 04:48.833
Sorry I missed
your selection ceremony.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.041
I’ve been, you know...

04:55.375 --> 04:56.458
shoveling his poop.

04:58.791 --> 05:00.416
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

05:01.083 --> 05:04.083
I guess Mr. D wasn’t too happy
you told me about my mom?

05:04.208 --> 05:05.250
No.

05:06.083 --> 05:07.208
No, he was not.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.791
So, who’d you choose to go with you?

05:13.625 --> 05:14.625
You.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.750
Funny. No, seriously, who'd you choose?

05:19.958 --> 05:20.958
I chose you.

05:23.291 --> 05:24.291
Why?

05:26.416 --> 05:32.250
You shall be betrayed
by the one who calls you friend,

05:33.291 --> 05:39.041
and fail to save
what matters most in the end.

05:40.583 --> 05:41.625
I trust you.

05:44.416 --> 05:48.958
And... And, right now,
nothing's more important than that.

05:52.125 --> 05:53.750
I'm gonna pack the best snacks.

06:12.708 --> 06:14.250
How much money did they give you?

06:15.000 --> 06:19.250
Um, 200 dollars in cash,
and a bag of these.

06:21.041 --> 06:23.250
I think they’re Canadian, maybe?

06:24.208 --> 06:25.750
Or from Chuck E. Cheese, I don’t know.

06:26.333 --> 06:27.541
They’re golden drachmas.

06:28.958 --> 06:31.083
Dollars for human world,
drachmas for mythic world.

06:31.083 --> 06:32.250
Don't mix 'em up.

06:35.750 --> 06:36.875
I brought you this.

06:49.875 --> 06:50.875
Well, these are...

06:52.291 --> 06:53.916
interesting.

06:59.458 --> 07:00.458
Maia.

07:05.791 --> 07:07.041
Those are interesting.

07:08.166 --> 07:11.541
A gift. [clicks tongue] From my dad.

07:12.916 --> 07:13.958
Maia.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.291
I thought about choosing you
before I chose Grover.

07:23.416 --> 07:25.500
Hey, Grover’s a lot stronger
than people think.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.583
I was afraid.

07:28.791 --> 07:31.583
I have a chance to rescue my mom
from Hades.

07:33.791 --> 07:35.333
I can’t let anything stop me.

07:36.416 --> 07:38.166
And I’m afraid...

07:39.458 --> 07:42.125
if it gets in the way of the quest,
Annabeth might try to.

07:42.125 --> 07:45.083
And you told me you'll always be
on her side no matter what,

07:45.083 --> 07:46.458
- and--
- It’s okay.

07:47.541 --> 07:50.166
Really, I... I get it.

07:53.250 --> 07:54.875
Just take care of each other out there.

08:09.125 --> 08:10.833
She’s really gonna miss that tree, huh?

08:13.416 --> 08:15.875
When Annabeth first arrived here
with Thalia and Luke,

08:15.875 --> 08:17.625
they were being chased by monsters.

08:18.208 --> 08:20.708
Agents of Hades. Sisters.

08:21.708 --> 08:22.708
Furies.

08:23.750 --> 08:25.250
- Mrs. Dodds?
- Yes!

08:26.083 --> 08:28.041
One was our algebra teacher. Alecto.

08:29.791 --> 08:32.625
Thalia turned back to fight
to buy her friends some time.

08:33.333 --> 08:36.333
Her satyr Protector tried to stop her,
but she wouldn’t listen.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.666
So, at the last moment...

08:39.875 --> 08:42.041
Zeus intervened
to save her life and...

08:43.333 --> 08:44.375
changed her form.

08:45.583 --> 08:49.250
The most powerful being
in the universe’s best idea

08:49.250 --> 08:50.833
to save his daughter’s life...

08:51.833 --> 08:53.625
was to turn her into a tree?

08:54.166 --> 08:56.333
She was the bravest demigod I ever knew.

08:57.291 --> 08:59.833
She fought valiantly,
and she met a hero’s fate.

09:00.666 --> 09:01.958
She met a pinecone’s fate.

09:05.041 --> 09:10.875
Forbidden children are always in danger,
even the strongest ones, even Thalia.

09:11.500 --> 09:14.166
And you are not Thalia.

09:14.375 --> 09:17.333
Do exactly as I say,
and maybe you survive this.

09:18.666 --> 09:19.666
Are we clear?

09:26.125 --> 09:27.416
Does she think she’s in charge?

09:28.250 --> 09:29.416
Who’d you think would be in charge?

09:29.708 --> 09:32.416
I guess I assumed we’d do
a show of hands or something.

09:37.500 --> 09:40.041
<i>Hero’s quests
are world-defining events.</i>

09:42.416 --> 09:44.708
<i>They have made and broken empires...</i>

09:46.500 --> 09:48.916
<i>altered the course
of human civilization...</i>

09:50.291 --> 09:52.708
<i>changed the balance of power on Olympus.</i>

09:59.500 --> 10:01.375
<i>A quest is a sacred thing.</i>

10:05.333 --> 10:07.875
<i>And to be charged with one
is to be in conversation</i>

10:07.875 --> 10:09.208
<i>with the gods themselves.</i>

10:16.291 --> 10:18.750
There is no way
this is what sacred smells like.

10:19.041 --> 10:21.208
We’re soldiers on a mission.
It’s not a vacation.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.458
Thank you for clearing that up.

10:23.666 --> 10:26.875
But if this is so important, why didn’t
Chiron spring for plane tickets?

10:27.375 --> 10:30.083
This seems kind of low priority,
doesn’t it?

10:30.708 --> 10:32.875
Sorry, I assumed someone had told you.

10:33.708 --> 10:34.750
Tell me what?

10:34.750 --> 10:37.500
Percy, it isn’t just the monsters
who are gonna be trying to stop us.

10:38.708 --> 10:40.166
You’re a forbidden child.

10:40.375 --> 10:42.875
Zeus might decide
to take a shot at you himself.

10:43.416 --> 10:45.000
The sky is his domain.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.250
We’d be serving you up on a silver platter
to try to travel through it.

10:49.541 --> 10:51.291
Yeah, no one mentioned that.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.666
<i>Okay,
I'm gonna go get us some snacks.</i>

10:57.791 --> 11:00.250
- I’ll come with you.
- No, you’ll stay right there.

11:00.583 --> 11:02.291
Why? It smells terrible back here.

11:02.833 --> 11:06.166
Monsters can’t smell you through that,
so that’s where I want you.

11:06.750 --> 11:07.875
I wanna vote.

11:08.083 --> 11:10.125
Who thinks that we should all go get
to breathe fresh air

11:10.125 --> 11:12.125
- and buy our own snacks?
- There’s no voting.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.791
Chips and sodas okay for you guys?

11:13.916 --> 11:16.375
I don’t think you should just get
to decide we don’t vote.

11:16.708 --> 11:18.541
- I’m sorry to hear that.
- Okay.

11:19.041 --> 11:21.083
I wanna vote on whether you get
to decide we don’t vote.

11:21.083 --> 11:23.750
Grover, please, can you help your...

11:25.583 --> 11:28.000
- ...friend?
- I really don't wanna be a tiebreaker.

11:29.833 --> 11:30.958
I have a better idea.

11:33.291 --> 11:37.750
<i>♪ Oh, golly, the road’s gettin’ bumpy
'cause I got me some friends ♪</i>

11:37.875 --> 11:39.791
<i>♪ Who just can’t get along ♪</i>

11:39.791 --> 11:42.833
<i>♪ Oh, dear! When the team’s
gettin’ grumpy ♪</i>

11:43.041 --> 11:45.791
<i>♪ The trick to gettin’ through it
is singin’ this song-- ♪</i>

11:45.916 --> 11:46.916
Dude, what are you doing?

11:49.125 --> 11:50.458
It’s the consensus song.

11:51.083 --> 11:53.833
Verse two encourages us
to say nice things about each other.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.083
You get a few rounds in
and you’d be amazed

11:56.083 --> 11:57.458
at how disagreements just kind of...

12:02.125 --> 12:03.125
fade away.

12:06.041 --> 12:07.333
Chips and sodas okay for you guys?

12:07.333 --> 12:08.625
- Whatever.
- Yes, please.

12:09.208 --> 12:10.208
Okay.

12:12.916 --> 12:14.541
Our voting system's broken.

12:49.208 --> 12:51.416
<i>Monsters can’t be
avoided entirely.</i>

12:52.583 --> 12:54.416
<i>They’re more common than you think.</i>

12:55.666 --> 12:59.833
<i>The trick is to spot them first
before they spot you.</i>

13:03.375 --> 13:06.666
It’s true they are more likely
to sense a more powerful demigod.

13:07.333 --> 13:11.083
A child of the Big Three,
Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades,

13:11.083 --> 13:13.125
is at the most extreme risk.

13:16.958 --> 13:19.791
<i>But it isn’t your power,
exactly, that draws them.</i>

13:20.541 --> 13:22.250
<i>It’s more complicated than that.</i>

13:23.291 --> 13:24.333
They smell fear.

13:24.625 --> 13:25.750
That’s bees.

13:26.625 --> 13:30.041
What a monster senses
kinda depends on the monster.

13:31.333 --> 13:33.791
Some are better
at sensing your inadequacy.

13:34.583 --> 13:37.875
Some, your need for glory, your shame.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.750
It’s important to remember that
if you’ve ever gotta confront one...

13:44.541 --> 13:46.333
wherever your armor is weakest,

13:46.958 --> 13:49.125
that monster's probably coming
right for it.

13:49.583 --> 13:53.500
Nothing will stop them, not even death.

14:05.166 --> 14:06.791
If you guys were better
at your job,

14:07.541 --> 14:09.458
I might not have noticed
you here so easily.

14:11.041 --> 14:12.791
If Thalia were better at hers,

14:12.791 --> 14:16.375
there might not be a family of squirrels
making her their home.

14:17.916 --> 14:19.708
Is that why
Hades sent you here?

14:20.208 --> 14:22.958
To gloat over a job
you almost did right once?

14:23.083 --> 14:26.083
How things have changed.

14:26.958 --> 14:30.333
You're not the frightened little girl
I came for all those years ago.

14:31.041 --> 14:33.791
Don’t kid yourself.
I wasn’t that frightened.

14:34.958 --> 14:37.083
Maybe so. Maybe so.

14:38.833 --> 14:42.458
Either way, now it would seem
that you're exactly what they say you are.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.375
The pride of Athena’s offspring.

14:46.416 --> 14:49.166
Perhaps the most
formidable demigod child alive.

14:49.166 --> 14:50.250
Why are you here?

14:51.750 --> 14:53.416
I'm here to collect your friend.

14:53.541 --> 14:55.458
Collect him? For what?

14:55.583 --> 14:56.958
Oh, I don’t question orders.

14:56.958 --> 15:00.083
"Bring him in, quick and quiet."
That is what I was told.

15:00.250 --> 15:04.958
Lure him off this bus where I can take him
quietly away from so many eyes,

15:04.958 --> 15:08.458
and your quest goes on
unimpeded and unburdened.

15:09.458 --> 15:11.541
We both know he isn’t gonna be
of any help to you,

15:11.541 --> 15:13.166
and maybe even a hindrance.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.416
Some children must learn the hard way.

15:23.416 --> 15:25.333
Look, I’m not against
the idea of consensus,

15:25.333 --> 15:27.958
I’m just not sure the song is doing
what you think it is, is all.

15:27.958 --> 15:30.083
Guys, you need to open that window! Now!

15:31.041 --> 15:32.666
I don't think these windows
are supposed to--

15:34.000 --> 15:35.541
Oh, no.

15:36.750 --> 15:38.041
Go, go, go, go, go!

15:43.916 --> 15:46.958
Everyone, leave your belongings
and exit the front of the bus.

15:51.791 --> 15:53.583
Excuse me. Lady.

15:55.958 --> 15:57.166
Annabeth, let's go!

16:02.750 --> 16:04.333
Hey!

16:11.041 --> 16:12.708
We're done here. Let's go.

16:26.416 --> 16:28.583
Somewhere up ahead,
this turns into a satyr path.

16:29.500 --> 16:30.666
What’s a satyr path?

16:31.083 --> 16:32.583
It's a road through
the wilderness.

16:32.958 --> 16:34.333
Satyr explorers use them.

16:34.708 --> 16:35.791
Harder to track us.

16:35.958 --> 16:38.291
That’s great,
but if we stay in the wilderness,

16:38.291 --> 16:39.583
how are we gonna find a phone?

16:39.916 --> 16:41.166
What do we need a phone for?

16:41.750 --> 16:43.000
So we can call camp.

16:43.875 --> 16:45.250
T-- To get help.

16:45.916 --> 16:47.666
We don’t need help. We’re fine.

16:48.541 --> 16:49.708
We’re fine?

16:51.125 --> 16:54.166
We haven’t even gotten to Trenton,
and we're wandering through a forest.

16:54.291 --> 16:57.250
I didn’t even know they had forests
in New Jersey, but we've found one.

16:57.666 --> 16:59.625
I would say we're the opposite of fine.

16:59.625 --> 17:01.583
We were sent on
a quest by the Oracle,

17:01.875 --> 17:02.875
by the gods.

17:03.375 --> 17:04.750
What'd you think, it would be easy?

17:05.041 --> 17:06.750
It’s supposed to be hard.

17:07.458 --> 17:09.291
That’s why only certain people are chosen.

17:09.666 --> 17:12.791
If we call camp, we’re basically saying
it was a mistake to choose us.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.416
I’m completely comfortable with that.

17:17.375 --> 17:18.583
Everyone makes mistakes.

17:19.416 --> 17:21.583
Why are you so afraid of who you are?

17:21.875 --> 17:23.041
What?

17:24.125 --> 17:26.875
You know, what’s interesting
about this particular satyr path

17:26.875 --> 17:28.833
is it’s actually the one
my Uncle Ferdinand took

17:28.833 --> 17:30.250
when he set out on his own quest.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.875
What was that supposed to mean,
afraid of who I am? I’m not afraid.

17:33.416 --> 17:35.250
Yes, you are.

17:36.083 --> 17:37.375
You aren't just a kid.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.625
"Just a kid" doesn’t do
what you did to Clarisse back at camp.

17:41.625 --> 17:45.291
"Just a kid" doesn’t have Hades
sending top lieutenants to retrieve them.

17:46.375 --> 17:48.041
You know, you are a part of something

17:48.041 --> 17:50.333
so much bigger
than we can understand right now.

17:50.750 --> 17:53.458
We have to move forward,
whether you like it or not,

17:53.458 --> 17:55.000
whether you want to or not.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.875
You don’t want to call camp, fine.

17:58.166 --> 18:00.625
Then, at least let’s call your mom.

18:02.333 --> 18:03.333
Excuse me?

18:04.041 --> 18:05.875
Athena? Your mother.

18:06.791 --> 18:10.583
I’d call my father,
but we aren’t exactly on speaking terms.

18:10.916 --> 18:12.750
You know, because of
the lifelong neglect and all,

18:12.750 --> 18:16.375
but you and your mother seem close.
So, why don't we ask her for help?

18:16.375 --> 18:19.208
Grover, will you explain to your friend
that he needs to pull himself together?

18:20.833 --> 18:22.875
You can’t ask her, can you?

18:24.083 --> 18:26.166
- When was the last time she talked to you?
- Grover.

18:26.166 --> 18:28.208
I don’t know why
you keep pulling him into this.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.083
- He’s on my side.
- What makes you think that?

18:30.083 --> 18:31.875
He’s my Protector, it’s his job.

18:31.875 --> 18:34.083
- He was my Protector first.
- First?

18:36.000 --> 18:37.083
What do you mean "first?"

18:38.583 --> 18:42.708
Very exciting, getting to walk
in Uncle Ferdinand’s footsteps.

18:42.875 --> 18:46.333
Next best thing to getting
to talk to him again.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.250
Thalia, Luke, and Annabeth
had a satyr Protector.

18:50.500 --> 18:51.500
That was you.

18:53.708 --> 18:55.375
Why didn't you tell me?

18:57.333 --> 18:58.375
Do you guys smell that?

18:58.666 --> 19:02.208
- Grover, I’m not kidding--
- No, neither am I. Just shush.

19:06.791 --> 19:07.791
Hamburgers.

19:16.791 --> 19:17.791
Grover.

19:18.416 --> 19:20.791
- What are you doing--
- Somebody's making hamburgers

19:20.916 --> 19:23.250
in the middle of nowhere, on a satyr path.

19:24.041 --> 19:25.291
Whoever it is...

19:26.541 --> 19:27.791
they’re from our world.

19:44.875 --> 19:46.125
Oh, come on.

19:47.333 --> 19:48.375
What?

19:48.791 --> 19:51.708
Aunty "Em" has a garden
full of petrified stone folks.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.250
Yeah, this is someone
from our world, all right.

19:55.833 --> 19:58.166
Anyone wanna guess what "Em" is short for?

20:00.791 --> 20:01.791
Oh.

20:06.916 --> 20:09.458
Let’s get out of here,
please, while we still can.

20:17.291 --> 20:19.791
You should have accepted my offer
when you had the chance.

20:21.083 --> 20:23.083
Offer? What offer is she talking about?

20:26.375 --> 20:28.250
Not today, friends.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.291
Not on my doorstep.

20:34.875 --> 20:35.958
Oh, shoot.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.583
If you have something to resolve,
why not come inside and I’ll help?

20:43.000 --> 20:45.541
Alecto? Will you be joining us?

20:47.791 --> 20:50.083
No, well I wouldn’t think you would.

20:52.125 --> 20:54.291
She won’t bother you
as long as you’re with me.

20:55.041 --> 20:56.916
But it isn’t as though
she’ll leave either,

20:56.916 --> 21:02.375
not if it means reporting that she failed
to retrieve the son of Poseidon.

21:04.416 --> 21:05.416
How did you--

21:05.541 --> 21:07.375
A forbidden child
has been claimed.

21:07.916 --> 21:09.916
How long did you think
that secret would keep?

21:11.625 --> 21:14.166
It’s a pleasure to meet you,
son of Poseidon.

21:15.166 --> 21:16.500
I’m Medusa.

21:22.375 --> 21:23.541
Percy, don’t.

21:23.833 --> 21:25.000
She’s a monster.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.708
We all choose
who we make our monsters,

21:27.833 --> 21:31.375
but, right now, that one wants
to tear you limb from limb...

21:32.625 --> 21:35.916
and I’m offering you lunch.
The choice is yours.

21:45.500 --> 21:46.666
I think we can trust her.

21:46.666 --> 21:47.875
- What?
- Dude!

21:47.875 --> 21:49.416
I can’t explain it, I just...

21:50.375 --> 21:52.000
My mom used to tell me her story.

21:53.041 --> 21:55.500
And the point was always
that she isn’t what people think.

21:56.041 --> 21:57.458
And I definitely trust my mom.

22:00.208 --> 22:03.666
So I’m going in.
You guys do what you want.

22:06.875 --> 22:07.916
What are you...

22:25.583 --> 22:26.750
You must be hungry.

22:27.416 --> 22:30.166
I left snacks on the table
while I get something proper going.

22:36.083 --> 22:37.208
You think it’s safe to eat?

22:38.833 --> 22:41.250
Percy, I’m not gonna lie to you,
I’m really hungry,

22:41.250 --> 22:43.041
and I’m ready to take that chance.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.083
Thanks for coming.

22:49.250 --> 22:51.125
This isn’t the same for me
as it is for you.

22:51.458 --> 22:52.458
Why?

22:52.750 --> 22:55.166
You're concerned I would hold
a grudge against you

22:55.166 --> 22:57.375
simply because you are
a daughter of Athena?

22:58.875 --> 23:02.208
You shouldn’t be.
We're not our parents after all.

23:02.875 --> 23:05.333
And you and I might have more
in common than you think.

23:08.166 --> 23:10.166
Please, sit and eat.

23:18.875 --> 23:20.583
So you’re not a monster,
what are you then?

23:22.666 --> 23:23.666
A survivor.

23:23.875 --> 23:25.333
You must be a little more than that.

23:26.250 --> 23:28.500
There's a Fury out there
that seems terrified of you.

23:28.916 --> 23:30.666
Because she knows what I think of her.

23:31.458 --> 23:35.333
I don’t like bullies.
When one shows up on my doorstep,

23:35.333 --> 23:38.791
they end up spending a lot more time there
than they planned for.

23:39.458 --> 23:43.083
The gift the gods gave me
is that I cannot be bullied anymore.

23:44.250 --> 23:46.000
What my mother did
to you wasn’t a gift,

23:46.833 --> 23:47.833
it was a curse.

23:49.375 --> 23:51.083
You are loyal to your mother.

23:51.875 --> 23:52.875
Yes.

23:53.208 --> 23:55.958
- You stand by her?
- Always.

23:56.583 --> 23:58.708
- You love her?
- Of course, I do.

23:58.708 --> 24:00.166
And so did I.

24:02.416 --> 24:03.458
So did I.

24:05.041 --> 24:07.791
Do you know the story
of how I came to be this way?

24:07.916 --> 24:08.958
I do.

24:09.833 --> 24:11.416
Do you?

24:14.000 --> 24:15.041
Do I?

24:17.333 --> 24:20.750
Athena was everything to me.

24:21.750 --> 24:26.500
I worshipped her, I prayed to her.
I made offerings...

24:27.583 --> 24:28.750
She never answered.

24:29.333 --> 24:32.833
Not even an omen
to suggest she appreciated my love.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.041
I wasn’t like you, sweetheart.

24:38.208 --> 24:39.291
I was you.

24:41.541 --> 24:44.125
I would have worshipped her
that way for a lifetime...

24:45.958 --> 24:47.083
in silence.

24:49.166 --> 24:53.208
But then one day, another god came,
and he broke that silence.

24:55.041 --> 24:58.875
Your father.
The Sea God told me that he loved me.

24:59.625 --> 25:03.791
I felt as though he saw me in a way
I had never felt seen before.

25:04.833 --> 25:07.958
But then Athena declared
that I had embarrassed her

25:07.958 --> 25:09.500
and I needed to be punished.

25:10.750 --> 25:11.750
Not him.

25:13.375 --> 25:14.375
Me.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.041
She decided
that I would never be seen again

25:19.166 --> 25:21.375
by anyone who would live to tell the tale.

25:24.500 --> 25:25.666
That isn’t what happened.

25:26.041 --> 25:28.583
My mother is just, always.

25:28.708 --> 25:33.041
The gods want you to believe that,
that they are infallible.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.041
But they only want what all bullies want.

25:36.166 --> 25:39.041
They want us to blame ourselves
for their own shortcomings.

25:39.041 --> 25:42.083
That is not what happened.
And you are a liar.

25:48.500 --> 25:49.958
Something’s burning.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.166
Would you give me a hand in the kitchen?
I think lunch is ready.

26:06.625 --> 26:07.666
Grover...

26:09.041 --> 26:10.041
get ready to run.

26:27.416 --> 26:28.708
She's not usually like that.

26:31.791 --> 26:34.291
I mean, a little bit, she is,
but that was a lot.

26:34.291 --> 26:35.708
She’s going to betray you.

26:36.958 --> 26:38.833
Sooner or later, people like her,

26:39.250 --> 26:41.083
they always do.

26:41.208 --> 26:42.500
I don’t think she’s like that.

26:42.500 --> 26:45.750
Then you will be an easy mark
for her when the time comes.

26:46.791 --> 26:47.791
What do you care?

26:49.416 --> 26:52.791
Your mother and I,
we're like sisters in a way.

26:53.458 --> 26:55.250
Targeted by the same monster.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.166
So I find myself
feeling protective of you.

26:59.375 --> 27:00.416
A monster?

27:03.208 --> 27:05.375
My mom never talked about my dad that way.

27:07.041 --> 27:08.250
Where is she now,

27:09.333 --> 27:10.416
your mother?

27:11.916 --> 27:13.041
Is she safe?

27:15.166 --> 27:16.166
No.

27:18.166 --> 27:19.208
She’s not.

27:21.541 --> 27:24.958
And do you trust your friends
to help you to make her safe?

27:26.166 --> 27:30.500
Will they let you make her safe
if it conflicts with their quest?

27:33.541 --> 27:34.875
I could...

27:36.416 --> 27:40.041
help you remove them from the equation,

27:41.083 --> 27:42.791
so that you can be free of them.

27:45.125 --> 27:46.333
If you ask me to.

29:29.125 --> 29:30.125
Come on.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.791
There’s three of us
and only one of her.

29:47.125 --> 29:49.000
If we split up,
she can’t be watching us all at once.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.791
- I don’t think it’d be that simple.
- It could be.

29:51.583 --> 29:55.083
Here’s the plan. I’ll get in the air,
I’ll draw her attention.

29:55.250 --> 29:57.791
As soon as you hear me say, "Maia,"
you guys start--

29:57.916 --> 30:00.041
Oh, boy! Okay! Um...

30:00.583 --> 30:04.500
Off. Down.

30:08.458 --> 30:09.958
So, we’re gonna need a new plan.

30:10.541 --> 30:14.666
We are not our parents,
until we choose to be.

30:16.041 --> 30:17.916
You two have chosen.

30:22.916 --> 30:25.583
A daughter
of a self-righteous mother,

30:26.333 --> 30:29.083
who chose self-righteousness for herself.

30:43.083 --> 30:47.000
And you,
you could have shown your father

30:47.166 --> 30:50.541
what it means to stand up
for someone you love.

30:52.708 --> 30:55.541
You could choose
to save your mother

30:55.541 --> 30:58.083
instead of doing your father’s bidding.

30:59.083 --> 31:01.625
If neither of you will help
teach these lessons,

31:02.125 --> 31:05.083
perhaps you should be the lessons.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.958
When I ship your statues to Olympus...

31:10.333 --> 31:14.333
...maybe that will get
my point across even better.

31:15.708 --> 31:16.708
Stand up.

31:19.083 --> 31:20.500
Let’s have a look at you.

31:32.791 --> 31:35.916
I didn’t really think this through!

31:38.208 --> 31:39.208
Now!

31:46.541 --> 31:48.875
- Did you hear that?
- Hey, are you okay?

31:51.791 --> 31:53.166
Did you say something?

32:06.791 --> 32:08.916
- Aw, man.
- You found it?

32:12.208 --> 32:13.208
Hope so.

32:16.041 --> 32:17.458
Want me to take it from here?

32:17.458 --> 32:18.750
No, no, I got it.

32:18.916 --> 32:22.375
Just make sure it’s pointing
in the right direction

32:22.375 --> 32:23.750
before you take my hat off.

32:25.416 --> 32:27.333
- Good tip.
- Okay.

32:31.125 --> 32:34.291
- My hands are kinda full...
- Of course.

33:18.833 --> 33:19.833
What is it?

33:23.333 --> 33:24.416
Uncle Ferdinand.

33:25.041 --> 33:26.125
Oh, no.

33:26.250 --> 33:27.916
Grover, I’m so sorry.

33:30.833 --> 33:32.666
This is as far as he got on his quest.

33:34.916 --> 33:36.583
We aren’t even to Trenton.

33:37.041 --> 33:38.333
But look at him.

33:40.666 --> 33:42.291
He’s not like the others, he...

33:44.708 --> 33:45.875
He doesn’t look afraid.

33:50.666 --> 33:53.458
You used the, um,
you used the head to get rid of Alecto?

33:54.333 --> 33:55.333
Yeah.

33:56.666 --> 33:57.666
Good.

33:59.833 --> 34:01.041
That was the right move.

34:03.750 --> 34:07.500
Uh, we probably should get going.
It’ll be dark soon.

34:08.708 --> 34:10.166
But what are we gonna do with the head?

34:11.458 --> 34:14.125
I just took down a Fury with it,
and I wasn’t even trying.

34:14.125 --> 34:16.166
We can’t just leave it
for someone to find.

34:16.958 --> 34:18.791
Leave the hat on
and bury it in the basement,

34:19.041 --> 34:20.291
that oughta keep it safe.

34:24.875 --> 34:25.875
Sure.

34:27.041 --> 34:29.208
Now, can we talk
about the bigger issue here?

34:30.041 --> 34:31.083
What bigger issue?

34:31.083 --> 34:32.791
"You could have saved your mother."

34:33.375 --> 34:35.583
That’s what she said to you,
like you discussed it already.

34:35.583 --> 34:37.625
- Is your mother still alive?
- She’s with Hades.

34:38.333 --> 34:41.250
- But I appreciate your concern.
- Guys, just please stop.

34:41.250 --> 34:43.958
Oh, I'm concerned.
What are you actually doing on this quest?

34:43.958 --> 34:45.916
And why did I have to hear
about this from Medusa?

34:45.916 --> 34:49.166
Okay, while we’re at it,
"You should have accepted my offer?"

34:49.666 --> 34:50.875
What’s that about do you think?

34:51.000 --> 34:52.500
And why did we have to hear it
from Alecto?

34:52.500 --> 34:53.625
Enough!

34:56.541 --> 34:58.166
The hat was a gift from her mother.

34:59.041 --> 35:01.125
It’s the only thing she’s ever possessed
that connects them.

35:01.125 --> 35:02.416
That oughta matter to you.

35:04.125 --> 35:05.875
Okay, but how are we gonna make sure
this thing is safe?

35:05.875 --> 35:07.041
I’m not up to that yet.

35:08.875 --> 35:13.083
And you, really? His mom’s alive.

35:13.083 --> 35:15.583
Can you imagine how confusing
that must be for him?

35:15.583 --> 35:18.333
Feeling like he may have to choose
between the fate of the world

35:18.333 --> 35:21.333
and the fate of the only person
who's ever cared about him?

35:21.791 --> 35:23.291
Why are you talking like this?

35:23.791 --> 35:26.750
Because all day I’ve been trying
to keep this quest on track

35:26.750 --> 35:29.875
without upsetting either of you.

35:30.916 --> 35:33.541
But maybe things need to get a little
upsetting before they move forward.

35:34.875 --> 35:36.458
She asked you a question
back in the woods,

35:36.458 --> 35:38.958
and you never really answered.
What are you so afraid of?

35:38.958 --> 35:40.875
- What are you talking about?
- You heard me.

35:42.250 --> 35:44.333
- I don’t know.
- I think you do.

35:45.458 --> 35:47.375
You’ve been fighting with her,
you’ve been fighting with me.

35:47.500 --> 35:50.541
Because the Oracle said
one of you would betray me. Okay?

35:53.500 --> 35:56.375
"You shall be betrayed by one
who calls you a friend,

35:56.375 --> 35:59.250
"and you shall fail to save
what matters most in the end."

36:00.250 --> 36:01.625
That’s the rest of what she said to me.

36:03.791 --> 36:07.125
I chose her because
I couldn’t imagine we’d ever be friends.

36:07.416 --> 36:10.458
And I chose you because I thought
if I can count on anyone to be on my side,

36:10.458 --> 36:14.458
no matter what, it was you.
And now, I'm feeling so alone.

36:14.708 --> 36:17.666
I don’t know
what to think or who to trust.

36:28.291 --> 36:29.541
I didn’t mean it that way.

36:34.416 --> 36:37.333
Alecto offered to help our quest
if I gave you up to her.

36:38.666 --> 36:39.666
What did you say?

36:41.708 --> 36:42.750
I killed her sister.

36:47.541 --> 36:50.416
Medusa offered to help me save my mom
if I turned on the two of you.

36:52.208 --> 36:53.250
And what'd you say?

36:55.125 --> 36:56.250
I cut off her head.

37:00.416 --> 37:02.125
You didn’t choose to be demigods.

37:03.666 --> 37:05.625
We didn’t choose this quest.

37:07.291 --> 37:10.875
But we can decide that
as long as the three of us are together,

37:11.750 --> 37:13.041
none of us are gonna be alone.

37:15.958 --> 37:18.875
And if we can’t do that, we might as well
just head back to camp right now.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.250
'Cause we won’t make it.

37:26.458 --> 37:28.541
I think I’ve got a better idea
what to do with this.

37:34.041 --> 37:37.125
Hermes Express,
she ships these things all over.

37:37.833 --> 37:39.333
Some of it goes to Olympus.

37:41.208 --> 37:44.250
Percy, you can’t ship
Medusa’s head to Olympus.

37:45.166 --> 37:46.166
Why not?

37:47.041 --> 37:49.000
- Because the gods won’t like it.
- At all.

37:49.500 --> 37:50.666
-"At all" at all.
- Why?

37:50.666 --> 37:52.166
That’s what you do with dangerous stuff.

37:52.916 --> 37:55.916
Like batteries, you just
send 'em back where they came from.

37:56.375 --> 37:57.833
Okay. Look, this is a bad idea.

37:59.125 --> 38:01.458
- They will see this as impertinent.
- I am impertinent.

38:01.833 --> 38:03.416
Yes, but we’re not.

38:03.416 --> 38:04.791
Really, very not.

38:05.375 --> 38:06.458
Look.

38:07.166 --> 38:11.666
Medusa tried to derail our quest.
She’s got serious beef with your mom.

38:11.666 --> 38:13.208
When you look at it that way,

38:13.208 --> 38:15.708
this seems kinda like
tribute or something, doesn’t it?

38:16.833 --> 38:17.916
And besides...

38:20.541 --> 38:23.458
...this way,
a part of your mom’s still with us.

38:26.083 --> 38:27.125
Thank you.

38:32.875 --> 38:36.708
So this isn’t exactly what I meant.
By choosing each other.

38:38.666 --> 38:41.875
There are actual dangers involved here
that cannot be...

38:46.291 --> 38:48.166
You're gonna sing the song,
aren't you?
