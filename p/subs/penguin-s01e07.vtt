WEBVTT

00:27.402 --> 00:28.403
Ma.

00:36.786 --> 00:38.538
Ma, you almost done?

00:39.080 --> 00:40.123
Still workin', baby.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.001
It's the weekend.

00:44.085 --> 00:46.629
How 'bout we watch a movie,
one of the old ones you like?

00:46.713 --> 00:47.714
Maybe later.

00:49.299 --> 00:50.467
It's a date then.

00:52.761 --> 00:53.928
Oh, yeah?

00:54.512 --> 00:55.847
Who's payin'?

00:56.389 --> 00:58.558
Oh, look at this face.

00:58.641 --> 01:01.728
My big, strong bull of a boy.

01:03.104 --> 01:05.774
You're gettin' so handsome,
I can't take it.

01:08.985 --> 01:10.737
Boys, not inside!
You'll break something,

01:10.820 --> 01:12.322
runnin' around like lunatics.

01:12.405 --> 01:13.490
Jack, stop it!

01:14.324 --> 01:16.408
Benny, what the hell
are you doing?

01:16.493 --> 01:17.994
Do you hear me?
Get out of there!

01:18.078 --> 01:19.496
God damn it!

01:21.206 --> 01:22.207
Sorry, Ma.

01:22.289 --> 01:23.500
You're in trouble now.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.045
'Cause we...

01:28.880 --> 01:33.134
are a zombie family.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.803
No! No!

01:34.886 --> 01:37.055
I'm gonna eat
those sweet brains.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.139
-No!
-Let's feast!

01:38.223 --> 01:39.557
No!

01:39.640 --> 01:41.226
Delicious brains!

01:41.309 --> 01:43.311
My favorite. What a treat!

01:43.395 --> 01:44.437
Jack, come here, sweetheart.

01:44.521 --> 01:47.148
Now I'm a zombie.

01:47.232 --> 01:51.027
-Must eat Ozzie's brain.
-Benny!

01:51.110 --> 01:52.404
Will you take the boys out
for me?

01:52.487 --> 01:54.572
You got it, Mom. Of course.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.491
Thank you. My good boy.

01:56.574 --> 01:57.575
Go take 'em.

01:57.658 --> 02:00.286
All right, Benny, Oz,

02:00.370 --> 02:02.455
get your coats.
We're going outside for a while.

02:02.539 --> 02:05.041
Nah. I'm gonna stay and help Ma.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.752
Oswald, you need
to exercise your leg,

02:07.836 --> 02:08.961
build up your strength.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.256
Benny.

02:13.049 --> 02:14.175
Hold still.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.511
This stupid zipper!

02:17.762 --> 02:18.805
I'm sorry, biscuit.

02:18.888 --> 02:20.640
We'll get you a new coat soon.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.269
Oh, and, Jack, I want you
to find Rex down there

02:24.352 --> 02:25.853
and give him his book, will ya?

02:25.937 --> 02:27.188
Oswald, give me the book.

02:28.106 --> 02:29.858
-I can do it.
-I said Jack.

02:30.442 --> 02:31.568
-Okay.
-Go on.

02:31.651 --> 02:32.986
Let's go.

02:37.323 --> 02:39.284
Oh, and, boys, the second
those streetlights come on,

02:39.367 --> 02:41.119
I want your little asses home.
Ya hear me?

02:41.202 --> 02:42.454
Yes, Ma.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.003
-I don't wanna play baseball.
-You don't wanna play baseball,

02:50.086 --> 02:52.589
-what do you wanna play?
-I don't know. Soccer.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.049
Damn.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.258
Look at those rims.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.263
Rex must be the richest guy
in Gotham.

03:00.972 --> 03:02.098
Is it made of real gold?

03:02.182 --> 03:04.267
No, Benny, it's just paint.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.353
Gotta be something, though, huh?

03:07.645 --> 03:08.772
I'm sorry.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.816
Get him up. Get his ass up.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.110
-Been waitin' all week...
-Hey, we should come back later.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.279
-Rex!
-Hey.

03:16.404 --> 03:17.739
Jackie boy, that you?

03:18.448 --> 03:19.574
Shit!

03:19.657 --> 03:21.326
Fuckin' Popeye over here.

03:21.409 --> 03:22.410
Come here.

03:23.745 --> 03:24.788
Stay here with Benny.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.247
Ma don't want
you getting involved.

03:26.331 --> 03:29.209
Hey, fellas, you remember
Francis Cobb's son?

03:30.168 --> 03:32.879
He's joinin' the ROTC,
be a hero. Ain't that right?

03:33.713 --> 03:34.798
Yeah.

03:34.881 --> 03:35.882
What you got for me?

03:46.184 --> 03:48.186
-How's your mom doing?
-She's all right.

03:48.269 --> 03:49.646
Give her my regards.

03:55.067 --> 03:57.320
Hey, Rex. Nice to see ya.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.824
Oz, watch your mouth.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.827
-How much he give ya?
-Fifty. Come on.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.495
Holy shit! Can I see?

04:05.578 --> 04:08.456
We can go to the arcade
and play Double Dragon forever.

04:08.581 --> 04:09.833
No. I'm gonna give it to Ma.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.129
Rain's coming.
We gotta get inside.

04:14.212 --> 04:15.588
Benny, you wanna play
flashlight tag?

04:15.672 --> 04:17.966
-Yes. Flashlight tag.
-Yeah?

04:21.511 --> 04:23.805
Mr. Calabrese don't pay Ma
nearly enough,

04:23.888 --> 04:25.765
nothing close
to what she deserves.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.308
What are you talkin' about?

04:27.392 --> 04:29.352
He just gave us 50 bucks.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.563
Look, I'm tellin' you,
he ain't a good guy.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.566
You ever wonder
where he gets all that money?

04:34.649 --> 04:35.734
I don't have to.

04:36.901 --> 04:38.194
He's a gangster.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.447
Now it's coming down.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.117
Here we go. Here we go.

04:47.245 --> 04:48.246
Benny, you first.

04:49.706 --> 04:50.749
Here you go. Oz.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.466
Got 'em.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.095
I'm keepin' the red one.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.306
Ozzie, you're it first.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.266
Fine.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.101
Count to 10... slowly.

05:10.185 --> 05:11.269
And no peekin'.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.272
Go. Let's go.

05:15.357 --> 05:20.445
One, two, three, four...

05:22.572 --> 05:23.573
...ten.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.118
Ready or not...

05:33.625 --> 05:35.377
I know you're here somewhere.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.151
Oz.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.945
Guys, come on.
This is bullshit.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.489
You're supposed to stay
in the station.

06:06.783 --> 06:07.951
You gotta be kiddin' me.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.125
Hey! I can hear you
down there.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.459
Then come get us.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.628
I found you.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.714
Shouldn't have to flash
this stupid light in your faces

06:20.797 --> 06:21.798
for it to count.

06:22.632 --> 06:23.883
You know the rules, Oz.

06:25.510 --> 06:26.553
Fine.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.180
Hurry up!

06:29.264 --> 06:30.473
Come on, Ozzie.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.315
-Hey, Oz, you okay?
-Screw this!

06:39.399 --> 06:41.276
-Oz.
-Screw you guys!

06:43.445 --> 06:44.654
Oz, what's going on?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.823
You know it's hard
for me to get down there!

06:46.906 --> 06:48.033
I'm sorry, Oz.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.243
We'll start over, all right?

06:50.326 --> 06:52.078
I'll be it this time.
You and Benny can hide.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.165
Have fun gettin' out!

06:55.248 --> 06:56.291
Hey.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.543
Oz?

06:58.626 --> 07:01.004
-Oz, open the door.
-Oz! Don't--

07:01.087 --> 07:02.797
Get back here
and open this door.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.717
-Oz?
-Please!

07:29.366 --> 07:32.369
Oswald, Jesus! You're soaking.
What happened?

07:32.911 --> 07:33.912
Come here.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.123
Where are your brothers?

07:37.207 --> 07:38.500
They went to the movies.

07:38.582 --> 07:39.793
With what money?

07:40.710 --> 07:42.462
Rex gave Jack some cash.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.381
Why didn't you go?

07:44.964 --> 07:46.383
I wanted to be with you.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.552
Jack shouldn't have let you
walk home by yourself.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.097
I don't need Jack's help.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.181
Course not.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.643
'Cause my Oswald's tough...

07:57.769 --> 08:00.980
and gettin' stronger
every goddamn day.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.442
What do ya say
we watch our own movie, huh?

08:05.151 --> 08:06.444
Have our little date?

08:07.028 --> 08:08.446
Can I pick which one?

08:08.530 --> 08:11.533
Well, you always pick
the same damn thing, but sure.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.669
Oswald, what movie did you say
they went to?

08:25.338 --> 08:27.841
I'm worried I'm gonna have to
pick 'em up with all this rain.

08:33.388 --> 08:34.389
Uh...

08:35.056 --> 08:37.392
Beetlejuice, I think.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.436
Here, I made your favorite,

08:39.519 --> 08:40.854
whiskey and soda.

08:42.981 --> 08:43.982
Thank you.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.610
Oh, Christ. What I wouldn't do
to get out of here.

08:47.694 --> 08:50.905
Live in one of them penthouses
all the celebrities buy.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.532
That'd be nice, huh?

08:52.615 --> 08:53.825
Top floor.

08:53.908 --> 08:57.787
No one above ya or beside ya.

08:57.871 --> 08:58.872
One day, Ma.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.084
You ready to watch the movie?

09:06.004 --> 09:07.005
Yeah.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.968
-You warm enough?
-Yeah.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.262
-You?
-Yeah. Cozy.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.551
Let us out!

09:54.928 --> 09:56.179
Let me out!

09:56.262 --> 09:58.056
Please let us out!

10:15.156 --> 10:16.783
-Help!
-Help!

10:17.450 --> 10:19.994
Please let us out of here!

10:20.745 --> 10:21.871
Help!

11:01.369 --> 11:02.370
Beautiful.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.791
Thank you, Councilman.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.093
Ma?

11:19.137 --> 11:20.180
Ma?

11:21.264 --> 11:22.265
Vic?

11:25.935 --> 11:26.936
Shit.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.732
Hey, Vic.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.611
Vic. Victor. Vic, wake up.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.321
Victor! Hey!

11:37.280 --> 11:38.239
Vic.

11:38.323 --> 11:39.657
Where the fuck is Ma?

11:40.700 --> 11:41.743
Where is she?

11:41.826 --> 11:43.203
-I don't--
-Come on.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.331
Sofia... Sofia took her.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.458
-Took her where? How?
-I don't know. I, um...

11:48.500 --> 11:50.377
We were dancing, and...

11:50.460 --> 11:52.128
and the lights came on.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.296
Shut up.

11:57.175 --> 11:58.718
Fuck! It's Sal.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.305
Come on, Vic. You gotta get
outta here. Come on.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.390
You gotta go.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.476
-Get outta here.
-What about you?

12:06.559 --> 12:08.728
They got my ma.
I gotta face this head-on.

12:08.812 --> 12:11.231
All right, call Zhao,
Donny Boy. Go down the chain.

12:11.314 --> 12:12.649
Tell 'em what's going on.

12:12.732 --> 12:13.733
Oz, I'm sorry.

12:13.817 --> 12:14.859
Fuck your guilt.

12:15.944 --> 12:18.113
Just get me an army, kid. Go.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.924
Don't fuckin' move.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.175
Yeah, yeah.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.887
Take it easy!

12:42.971 --> 12:43.972
I ain't resisting.

12:44.931 --> 12:45.932
Hey, Sal.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.478
I found this at your place.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.731
Never cared much
for the game, myself.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.817
Too much sittin' and waitin'.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.112
Feels a little different,
doesn't it, Oz?

12:59.195 --> 13:02.032
No cops, no guards,
nothing to hold me back.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.329
They were my blood. My wife!

13:08.413 --> 13:09.622
Sir, you have an agreement

13:09.706 --> 13:11.750
-with Ms. Gigante.
-My son! My heart!

13:11.833 --> 13:13.960
-You filthy piece of shit!
-Sir!

13:14.044 --> 13:17.213
Sofia got you on a tight leash,
huh, Sal?

13:17.297 --> 13:18.298
Nah. Nah, nah.

13:18.381 --> 13:21.634
She and I, we want
the same things in the end.

13:27.265 --> 13:28.391
Yeah.

13:28.475 --> 13:32.020
That's just a little taste
of what you got comin'.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.105
We got your mother.

13:34.189 --> 13:35.190
Yeah.

13:35.273 --> 13:37.025
We got your family now.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.249
Good morning.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.959
Sofia, I got him.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.170
How's the old lady?

13:57.212 --> 13:59.923
Sofia! Jesus,
don't-don't hurt her!

14:00.006 --> 14:01.299
She got nothin' to do with this.

14:01.383 --> 14:03.051
Come on!
I'll do whatever you want.

14:03.134 --> 14:05.303
-You hear that?
-Do you feel better?

14:06.763 --> 14:08.014
It's not enough, Sofia.

14:08.098 --> 14:10.016
I know. Have patience.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.393
We're gonna kill him soon.

14:11.476 --> 14:12.602
Okay, okay.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.188
I'll call you
when we're headed your way.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.401
You're taking us
to see your operation.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.778
I ain't doin' shit
till I know my ma's all right.

14:22.487 --> 14:23.571
Just let me talk to her.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.450
Are you tryin'
to make a deal, Oz?

14:27.992 --> 14:29.327
With me?

14:29.411 --> 14:32.205
Nothin' personal, remember?

14:32.288 --> 14:33.623
Huh? Just part of the game.

14:34.332 --> 14:35.959
I hold up my end.
You hold up yours.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.628
You remember?
You said that to me. Right?

14:38.712 --> 14:40.547
You looked me right in the eye,

14:40.630 --> 14:42.173
like a gentleman,

14:42.257 --> 14:44.801
and you assured me
you wouldn't hurt my family.

14:46.428 --> 14:48.888
Guess what. I'm a gentleman too,

14:48.972 --> 14:51.391
and I'm gonna give you
the exact same deal.

14:51.474 --> 14:52.475
Go on.

15:08.158 --> 15:09.868
I brought you breakfast.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.548
You nervous?

15:23.631 --> 15:24.674
No.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.057
Francis Cobb...

15:32.640 --> 15:34.309
That's your name, right?

15:35.894 --> 15:38.188
You know, Oz told me
you died a few years back.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.982
-Mmm.
-He was torn up about it, too.

15:41.816 --> 15:44.736
I actually felt bad for him.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.780
Yeah, well...

15:46.863 --> 15:48.823
some people are easy marks.

15:49.407 --> 15:50.533
Mmm.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.535
So, did you bring me
all the way out here

15:52.619 --> 15:54.454
to feed me toast,
or you gonna kill me?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.250
Depends on your son.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.380
He's with Salvatore Maroni
right now.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.216
And if Oz leads us to the drugs
that he stole from me,

16:06.299 --> 16:08.093
then there are options.

16:08.176 --> 16:09.844
You don't know shit
about my boy, do ya?

16:11.012 --> 16:12.180
He's gonna roast Sal

16:12.263 --> 16:13.890
like he did his wife
and their bastard son,

16:13.973 --> 16:15.100
and then he's comin' for you.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.478
You have a lot of confidence
in your son.

16:18.561 --> 16:19.604
Yes, I do.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.696
So how'd you end up here then?

16:30.824 --> 16:33.910
You know, Oswald used
to rave about this house,

16:33.993 --> 16:35.286
how beautiful it was,

16:35.370 --> 16:38.289
but I...
I just ain't so impressed.

16:39.790 --> 16:42.919
This place ain't got
no goddamn personality.

16:43.003 --> 16:45.505
You afraid of color
or somethin'?

16:47.882 --> 16:49.092
You can blame my father.

16:50.176 --> 16:53.179
The Falcones were...
a bit conservative.

16:53.263 --> 16:56.474
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You're a... What? A Gigante now.

16:56.558 --> 16:58.810
Yeah, yeah. Oswald told me.

16:58.893 --> 17:00.395
What are you gonna do next?

17:00.478 --> 17:03.231
Dye your hair pink?
Get an ass tattoo?

17:03.732 --> 17:05.483
That'll teach
your daddy a lesson.

17:09.612 --> 17:10.946
Oz tells you a lot, huh?

17:11.531 --> 17:12.699
Yes, he does.

17:20.457 --> 17:21.583
I'll be honest with you.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.627
All those years working
for my family,

17:24.711 --> 17:27.380
I never gave much thought
to Oz's childhood.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.342
I know the, uh, highlights,
of course.

17:30.425 --> 17:32.052
He loves making a meal
out of those.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.387
"I'm an Eastside kid.

17:34.471 --> 17:35.764
I got a bum leg.

17:36.514 --> 17:37.974
No father."

17:38.058 --> 17:41.186
But those things don't make you
a monster, do they?

17:41.895 --> 17:44.064
Someone shaped him.

17:47.359 --> 17:50.111
Okay, you wanna know
about my boy, Oswald?

17:51.112 --> 17:52.072
Please.

17:52.781 --> 17:54.407
He's always two steps ahead.

17:54.491 --> 17:56.368
All those years,
driving you around,

17:57.243 --> 17:58.912
cleanin' up after you
and your family,

17:59.037 --> 18:01.373
he was watchin', studyin'.

18:01.956 --> 18:03.500
He knows this game better
than you.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.920
You changed your name. So what?

18:07.003 --> 18:08.672
Okay, you think
everything's different now.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.590
That don't change the game,
sweetheart.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.093
Drugs is drugs.

18:13.176 --> 18:16.304
Crack, Bliss, dope, Drops...
it's all the same shit.

18:17.347 --> 18:18.807
Same winners, same losers.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.309
So, you call yourself
whatever the hell you want,

18:21.393 --> 18:25.271
but when my Oswald puts a bullet

18:25.355 --> 18:27.524
in that pretty little skull
of yours,

18:27.607 --> 18:31.319
I'll be tap-dancing
on your grave,

18:31.403 --> 18:33.822
like Ginger fucking Rogers.

18:35.699 --> 18:37.242
It's a good thing
your other boys died

18:37.325 --> 18:39.828
before you could turn
them into monsters like Oz, huh?

18:39.911 --> 18:41.496
You shut your goddamn mouth.

18:41.579 --> 18:43.039
What happened to them?

18:43.123 --> 18:44.457
Are they even dead?

18:45.959 --> 18:47.961
Or is Oz keeping them locked up

18:48.044 --> 18:51.464
in some Eastside slum, too?

18:55.218 --> 18:56.219
What are you--

18:59.806 --> 19:01.349
Why would you-- Wh--

19:06.187 --> 19:07.230
You hear it too, don't you?

19:08.314 --> 19:09.357
Hmm?

19:09.441 --> 19:10.734
The rain-rain.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.115
They shoulda been home.

19:17.741 --> 19:19.242
I went lookin'
all goddamn night.

19:19.951 --> 19:22.287
You should be scouring
the streets for Christ's sake.

19:22.370 --> 19:24.039
That's your job, ain't it?

19:24.831 --> 19:27.250
Put out a goddamn report,
something!

19:27.375 --> 19:30.628
I told ya.
Jack is 15. Benny's 10.

19:31.212 --> 19:33.006
-Your boys?
-Yeah.

19:33.548 --> 19:34.883
Jack and Benny?

19:34.966 --> 19:36.885
No one seen 'em at the movies.
The arcade's closed.

19:36.968 --> 19:38.219
Probably soakin' wet
and cold.

19:38.303 --> 19:39.554
They didn't have
their umbrellas,

19:39.637 --> 19:41.389
and it's been rainin' all night.

19:41.973 --> 19:45.685
Please, you gotta find 'em.
It's been too long.

19:50.899 --> 19:54.694
Francis, where do you think
you are right now?

19:57.197 --> 19:58.490
Francis?

20:06.706 --> 20:08.750
Yeah, you get the fuck away
from me.

20:28.353 --> 20:29.354
Sofia?

20:34.150 --> 20:35.151
Why are you here?

20:35.235 --> 20:36.736
We may have a problem.

20:36.820 --> 20:40.407
I have a friend that works
at Brookside Children's Home.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.659
She's a psychiatrist.

20:44.285 --> 20:46.037
Brookside is
the residential facility

20:46.121 --> 20:47.706
that's looking after
your cousin Gia.

20:48.289 --> 20:49.374
Okay.

20:49.457 --> 20:52.127
Evidently, she's asking
to speak to the police.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.713
She's the only loose end
from the gassing.

20:55.505 --> 20:57.173
But Gia saw something
that night.

20:58.299 --> 20:59.926
Do you know
what she might have seen?

21:00.885 --> 21:01.886
No.

21:05.140 --> 21:06.141
I don't know.

21:06.808 --> 21:08.518
I don't want this
to be a burden to you.

21:09.561 --> 21:10.729
And I'm happy...

21:11.604 --> 21:12.605
to speak to her.

21:14.691 --> 21:16.484
Sofia, if she talks...

21:20.989 --> 21:22.032
I'll keep her quiet.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.451
But I could use your help...

21:25.035 --> 21:26.119
with something else.

21:42.552 --> 21:43.595
Francis.

21:44.679 --> 21:46.056
I'm Dr. Rush.

21:46.139 --> 21:47.974
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

22:19.255 --> 22:20.799
Get back! Everybody, get back!

22:26.304 --> 22:27.305
Jesus.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.231
This place is filthy.

22:36.815 --> 22:39.401
Figures you'd tuck your tail
into a shit pipe.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.237
Listen up, everybody.

22:42.320 --> 22:45.907
Oswald Cobb
is no longer in charge.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.284
As of now,

22:48.368 --> 22:52.455
you all work for the Gigante
and the Maroni families.

22:52.539 --> 22:55.250
So I want you
to pack up this product

22:55.375 --> 22:58.420
quickly and quietly. All right?

22:58.503 --> 23:00.588
-The fuck are you lookin' at?
-Hey, easy.

23:00.672 --> 23:02.590
-Fuck that!
-Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

23:02.674 --> 23:03.800
All right, I understand.

23:04.801 --> 23:07.470
You need a minute
to process this.

23:07.554 --> 23:08.722
You take that time now.

23:10.515 --> 23:12.350
Good. Get back to work!

23:16.730 --> 23:18.940
Listen, Sal, you got
some hate out. That's good.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.026
I gave you what you want.

23:21.109 --> 23:23.278
This whole thing,
it's yours now.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.363
Start of a whole new empire.

23:27.157 --> 23:29.325
Why you gonna share it
with Carmine's daughter, huh?

23:30.118 --> 23:31.453
Jesus!

23:31.536 --> 23:33.872
After everything
the Falcones took from you...

23:34.998 --> 23:36.249
Look at this shit.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.336
You got access
to the whole city.

23:40.378 --> 23:41.921
Just like a sewer rat.

23:43.381 --> 23:46.509
After we finishing packing up
Sofia's drugs,

23:46.593 --> 23:48.053
I'm gonna take you to her place.

23:49.387 --> 23:51.056
That's where you die, Oz.

23:51.890 --> 23:54.142
Only thing left
for her and I to figure out

23:54.893 --> 23:56.061
is how we're gonna do it.

24:01.024 --> 24:03.401
You know what
I'll never forget, Sal?

24:03.485 --> 24:04.486
It's the smell.

24:05.779 --> 24:07.072
The burning flesh,

24:07.655 --> 24:09.574
you know, muscle, fat, shit.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.117
The smell of hair.

24:11.701 --> 24:13.620
I didn't anticipate that.

24:13.703 --> 24:15.121
It's real distinct.

24:15.872 --> 24:17.832
Tell me somethin'.
Did your beautiful wife, Nadia,

24:17.916 --> 24:19.834
did she wear a special kind
of hairspray or somethin'?

24:19.918 --> 24:22.545
'Cause, man, she went up
like a tinderbox.

24:26.257 --> 24:27.509
Gimme a light.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.680
Mr. Maroni,
don't fucking touch--

25:07.340 --> 25:08.675
Motherfucker.

25:25.525 --> 25:26.484
What are you doin'?

25:27.444 --> 25:28.778
Come on, you bastard. Let's go.

25:29.654 --> 25:30.864
What are you doin'?

25:30.947 --> 25:32.365
Let's go.

25:32.449 --> 25:34.284
Come on. Come on!

25:37.746 --> 25:39.080
Oh.

25:39.164 --> 25:41.082
Oh, hell no. No, no, no, no.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.377
Sal, Sal, look at me.
Look at me!

25:45.712 --> 25:47.297
I beat you, Sal.

25:47.339 --> 25:49.841
You hear me? I beat you. I win.

25:59.392 --> 26:00.393
The fuck?!

26:03.229 --> 26:05.231
Come on. Jesus Christ!

26:07.317 --> 26:09.652
You were supposed
to destroy me, Sal!

26:09.736 --> 26:12.739
Show me what a big man you are,
what a fucking big man you are!

26:13.323 --> 26:14.783
Huh? Well, I got you.

26:14.866 --> 26:16.534
I fucking got you!

26:16.618 --> 26:18.912
You filthy, stupid prick!

26:18.995 --> 26:19.996
Fuck you!

26:21.206 --> 26:22.749
Tryin' to steal from me?

26:23.875 --> 26:26.378
Try to take what's mine,
what I built?

26:28.463 --> 26:29.589
What'd you say?

26:30.507 --> 26:31.758
I didn't hear ya.

26:31.841 --> 26:32.842
Say it again.

26:35.178 --> 26:37.639
Yeah. Didn't think so.

26:45.939 --> 26:47.649
I beat you, Salvatore Maroni.

27:08.837 --> 27:10.005
I win.

27:16.511 --> 27:17.846
Everybody gather round.

27:21.391 --> 27:22.392
This man...

27:24.644 --> 27:25.645
his men...

27:26.563 --> 27:28.106
dead, 'cause you did
the right thing.

27:28.189 --> 27:30.400
You protected your home,
your investment.

27:32.527 --> 27:35.113
I'm proud of ya, grateful to ya.

27:35.196 --> 27:36.197
But this ain't over.

27:37.657 --> 27:38.783
There's a storm comin'.

27:40.827 --> 27:42.412
I'm gonna need your help.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.585
This way, Miss Gigante.

28:05.435 --> 28:07.520
-End it!
-Gia, you have a visitor.

28:12.400 --> 28:13.610
Hi.

28:20.658 --> 28:21.659
Thank you.

28:33.004 --> 28:37.050
I know your doctor
has been asking questions.

28:39.552 --> 28:41.513
Did you tell her
that you saw something?

28:44.307 --> 28:45.642
I'm here to help you.

28:46.267 --> 28:48.520
It's okay. You can tell me.

28:51.106 --> 28:52.148
What did you see?

28:54.734 --> 28:57.404
I... saw a mask.

28:58.780 --> 28:59.781
In your bag.

29:03.618 --> 29:04.703
Did you kill them?

29:06.329 --> 29:07.455
My mom and my dad?

29:08.498 --> 29:09.749
Is that what you think?

29:12.711 --> 29:13.712
That...

29:14.504 --> 29:15.672
I would do something...

29:17.215 --> 29:18.967
as horrible as that?

29:21.928 --> 29:22.971
Gia.

29:23.054 --> 29:24.931
I loved your mom and dad.

29:27.851 --> 29:30.770
I know you want someone
to blame.

29:32.439 --> 29:34.482
But it was nobody's fault.

29:36.901 --> 29:39.487
It was a terrible accident.

29:40.155 --> 29:41.531
Do you understand?

29:45.410 --> 29:46.703
Good.

30:02.260 --> 30:03.887
Did you do this to yourself?

30:17.817 --> 30:18.818
Come here.

30:21.196 --> 30:22.155
Come here.

30:33.583 --> 30:35.251
It might sound confusing...

30:37.170 --> 30:40.382
and I know that it hurts...

30:42.759 --> 30:46.054
but your mom and your dad,
everyone in our family,

30:47.389 --> 30:49.265
they were bad people,

30:49.349 --> 30:50.809
who deserved it.

30:51.726 --> 30:54.312
And I am glad that they're gone.

30:56.064 --> 30:58.483
Don't hurt yourself
because of them.

31:01.319 --> 31:02.362
This is a gift.

31:04.781 --> 31:06.116
You're gonna get out of here,

31:07.158 --> 31:08.827
and you're gonna find
a new home.

31:12.247 --> 31:13.248
And...

31:15.500 --> 31:17.002
whatever woman you become...

31:20.130 --> 31:22.257
you deserve much better than...

31:22.340 --> 31:24.384
what this family
could have offered.

32:02.881 --> 32:03.882
Salvatore.

32:03.965 --> 32:06.176
Nah. Sal's dead, sweetheart.

32:07.177 --> 32:08.178
Take it in.

32:09.304 --> 32:11.348
It ain't how you were hopin'
it'd go.

32:12.223 --> 32:13.558
You wanna kill me.

32:14.601 --> 32:15.602
I get it.

32:17.854 --> 32:19.647
But there is one thing
you want more.

32:20.398 --> 32:23.526
Ever since I known ya, you know,
you had your eye on the throne.

32:23.610 --> 32:24.694
Now it's your chance.

32:25.779 --> 32:26.988
All you gotta do
is bring her to me,

32:27.072 --> 32:28.073
just bring her to me.

32:28.948 --> 32:30.992
Not a hair on her head
out of place.

32:31.659 --> 32:34.245
I'll give it to you,
the whole fuckin' thing,

32:34.329 --> 32:36.998
the Bliss, my operation,
my connects.

32:37.665 --> 32:40.168
The keys to the fuckin' kingdom
are here, Sofia.

32:44.255 --> 32:45.256
Whaddya say?

32:48.885 --> 32:50.720
And then it was just
you and Oz.

32:52.639 --> 32:53.723
Tell me how that felt.

32:54.641 --> 32:55.642
Go with it.

32:58.478 --> 32:59.479
Julian.

33:02.148 --> 33:03.983
I need to talk to you.

33:12.742 --> 33:14.911
Salvatore Maroni is dead.

33:15.036 --> 33:16.830
Oz... killed him.

33:18.581 --> 33:19.582
Are you all right?

33:20.083 --> 33:22.127
Oz wants me
to bring him his mother

33:22.210 --> 33:24.421
in exchange for the product.

33:24.504 --> 33:25.964
And, uh...

33:26.047 --> 33:27.048
I agreed.

33:27.132 --> 33:29.634
No. Sofia, it's a trap.

33:29.718 --> 33:30.719
I know.

33:31.720 --> 33:33.096
But it doesn't matter.

33:34.347 --> 33:35.807
None of it matters.

33:35.890 --> 33:37.267
What did Gia say to you?

33:38.768 --> 33:39.936
Is she gonna be a problem?

33:42.814 --> 33:44.941
Before my father put me away,

33:45.734 --> 33:48.445
he wanted me
to take over the Family.

33:50.530 --> 33:53.116
He put me in an institution.

33:54.325 --> 33:57.871
And the second I got out,
I walked...

33:59.497 --> 34:01.041
right into another one.

34:02.417 --> 34:03.460
She's right.

34:04.085 --> 34:07.464
Francis is right. I thought
I was doing something different,

34:07.547 --> 34:10.091
and I... I thought that I...

34:10.175 --> 34:11.760
I thought that I was different.

34:11.842 --> 34:15.138
But I'm still playing
my father's game.

34:15.221 --> 34:18.058
I'm-I'm abiding by his rules.

34:18.141 --> 34:19.641
I--

34:19.726 --> 34:21.186
Jesus Christ, I can't...

34:22.687 --> 34:24.272
breathe.

34:24.356 --> 34:25.648
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

34:25.732 --> 34:26.983
Sofia, look at me.

34:28.650 --> 34:31.362
Your father's hand
is not on your throat anymore.

34:31.446 --> 34:35.949
It doesn't matter what he
or anyone else wanted for you.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.121
What do you want?

34:43.291 --> 34:44.751
I wanna be free.

34:50.090 --> 34:51.382
I wanna be free.

34:57.889 --> 34:59.641
And I want Oz to feel pain...

35:01.893 --> 35:03.478
real pain,

35:05.271 --> 35:07.941
the kind that I have felt.

35:12.821 --> 35:14.614
I need him to suffer...

35:16.241 --> 35:17.492
for what he's done.

35:20.787 --> 35:22.831
Richie, you heard from Vic?

35:22.914 --> 35:24.708
Nah. I just keep getting
his voicemail.

35:25.375 --> 35:26.376
All right.

35:27.836 --> 35:28.837
All right!

35:29.671 --> 35:31.589
I know this ain't the job
you signed up for.

35:32.215 --> 35:33.967
But you're the only army I got.

35:34.050 --> 35:35.427
I wouldn't ask for another.

35:35.510 --> 35:36.511
All right?

35:37.345 --> 35:38.346
Come on.

35:40.640 --> 35:41.683
Oz?

35:42.183 --> 35:43.351
Zeke, you got somethin'?

35:44.352 --> 35:46.688
There's a black G-Wagen
heading your way.

35:47.397 --> 35:48.398
That's our girl.

35:49.399 --> 35:50.734
All right, everybody
out of sight.

35:51.985 --> 35:54.237
Fingers off triggers
till I give the word.

35:54.320 --> 35:57.449
Car's inside the tunnels.
Gates are closed and locked.

35:57.532 --> 35:58.533
Good.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.715
Come on, doll.

36:31.524 --> 36:32.776
What are you waitin' for?

36:49.000 --> 36:50.085
Hi.

36:50.168 --> 36:51.711
Sweetheart,
there ain't no goin' back.

36:51.795 --> 36:52.837
The doors are locked.

36:52.921 --> 36:54.798
I got your product.
You got my ma.

36:54.881 --> 36:56.383
As long as she's okay...

36:57.258 --> 36:58.259
we're good here.

37:01.012 --> 37:02.555
We gonna stare
at each other all night?

37:02.639 --> 37:03.932
You wanna finish this? Come on.

37:04.015 --> 37:06.393
Your mother is
a very interesting woman, Oz.

37:06.476 --> 37:07.769
Yeah, I know what my mother is.

37:07.852 --> 37:09.938
She helped me realize
a few things.

37:10.772 --> 37:12.691
I keep trying on
all these different faces,

37:12.774 --> 37:13.775
but...

37:14.484 --> 37:16.569
none of them feel quite right.

37:37.048 --> 37:39.426
Hey! Hey!

37:41.302 --> 37:42.303
Hey.

37:43.888 --> 37:45.640
What the fuck is goin' on?

37:45.724 --> 37:47.350
You think you know
what I want.

37:47.434 --> 37:49.644
That it's the same
for you and me.

37:49.728 --> 37:51.021
Of course you do.

37:52.022 --> 37:54.524
I guess this game was made
for men like you...

37:55.066 --> 37:56.067
like my father.

37:56.860 --> 37:57.986
Same winners.

37:58.611 --> 37:59.779
Same losers.

38:00.363 --> 38:03.783
It's why everyone expected me
to die in Arkham.

38:03.867 --> 38:05.618
No one even considered

38:06.453 --> 38:08.246
that I might learn something
there...

38:11.416 --> 38:13.084
how to play new games.

38:18.673 --> 38:19.758
I left ya a present.

38:22.677 --> 38:23.803
You find it yet?

38:29.351 --> 38:31.019
Yo, Oz, what's goin' on?

38:58.338 --> 39:00.256
Oz, what's in the car?

39:00.840 --> 39:02.050
Oh, fuck!

39:02.133 --> 39:03.802
There's enough time
to get out,

39:03.885 --> 39:05.178
I think.

39:06.930 --> 39:09.432
If you do, come by and see us.

39:18.817 --> 39:20.360
Oh, my God! It's a bomb!

39:52.308 --> 39:53.309
Ma?

39:54.060 --> 39:55.186
I got dinner for ya.

40:09.993 --> 40:11.077
You're up.

40:11.161 --> 40:12.412
Get dressed.

40:13.121 --> 40:14.122
We're goin' out.

40:16.041 --> 40:17.125
Go on. Your suit.

40:57.832 --> 41:00.001
I can't do this alone no more.

41:00.669 --> 41:02.253
You have to promise me

41:02.337 --> 41:04.756
that you're gonna make something
of yourself,

41:05.757 --> 41:09.678
that you'll get me
every goddamn thing I deserve.

41:12.222 --> 41:13.890
Or I ain't gonna make it.

41:14.557 --> 41:17.811
I don't know how else
I can live with this, Oswald.

41:17.894 --> 41:19.896
But you'll make me happy.

41:19.979 --> 41:23.108
'Cause I deserve
a happy life.

41:25.068 --> 41:26.069
Don't I?

41:27.862 --> 41:30.323
Don't I, Oswald? Tell me.

41:30.407 --> 41:31.741
Course you do, Ma.

41:32.826 --> 41:35.995
You deserve the best life,

41:37.539 --> 41:39.082
and I'm gonna get it for ya.

41:41.084 --> 41:42.335
I promise.

41:45.005 --> 41:46.798
And I ain't gonna quit
till I do.

43:12.967 --> 43:14.135
Vic?

43:18.056 --> 43:21.059
Well, if ain't the Penguin.

43:21.142 --> 43:22.977
-You made it.
-The fuck did you call me?

43:23.895 --> 43:25.313
Sofia wants to see ya.
