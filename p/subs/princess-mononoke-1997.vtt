Tokuma Shoten, Nippon Television Network,
Dentsu and Studio Ghibli present

00:15.557 --> 00:20.853
In ancient times the land
lay covered in forest.

00:20.979 --> 00:27.901
Here dwelt the spirits
of nature from time immemorial.

01:10.945 --> 01:17.576
PRINCESS MONONOKE

01:30.048 --> 01:31.298
Yakul!

01:37.055 --> 01:38.055
Ashitaka!

01:38.848 --> 01:41.683
Oracle says to get back to the village.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.143
The Old Man, too.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.480
- Something's wrong.
- The birds are gone.

01:46.606 --> 01:47.564
The animals too.

01:48.024 --> 01:51.860
I'll go to him. You'd better go now.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.358
Something's coming.

02:39.033 --> 02:42.411
- What is it?
- Don't know. It's not human.

02:42.871 --> 02:45.706
Oracle summoned everyone
back to the village.

02:46.916 --> 02:48.125
There!

03:17.864 --> 03:19.698
A demon god!

03:40.803 --> 03:41.970
Yakul, run!

04:07.956 --> 04:09.790
It'll attack the village!

04:10.667 --> 04:12.125
Ashitaka!

04:12.627 --> 04:15.629
Don't touch it!
Its curse will be on you!

04:16.505 --> 04:17.673
Yakul!

04:40.989 --> 04:42.781
Quiet your rage, I beg you!

04:43.449 --> 04:47.661
O forest god who cannot be
without name, why do you rampage so?

05:04.762 --> 05:06.513
- A monster!
- Run!

05:08.558 --> 05:11.393
Stop! Leave our village in peace!

05:11.894 --> 05:13.603
Stop! Still your rage!

05:18.026 --> 05:19.151
Get up!

06:14.957 --> 06:17.042
- It's down!
- Ashitaka!

06:17.168 --> 06:18.293
Bring Oracle!

06:18.419 --> 06:19.795
Stoke the fire!

06:21.381 --> 06:22.547
Ashitaka.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.470
Don't touch it.
It's no ordinary wound.

06:28.679 --> 06:31.515
He's hurt! Where's Oracle?

06:31.933 --> 06:34.559
All of you, stay back!

06:35.019 --> 06:35.977
Oracle!

06:36.187 --> 06:39.648
Pour this water on it, slowly.

06:53.496 --> 06:56.957
O raging god unknown to us...

06:57.083 --> 07:00.001
...I bow before you.

07:01.003 --> 07:05.424
Where you have fallen, we will
raise a mound and perform rites.

07:05.633 --> 07:08.510
Bear us no hate. Be at peace.

07:10.096 --> 07:13.098
Hear me, loathsome humans!

07:14.308 --> 07:17.978
You shall know
my agony and my hatred.

07:57.351 --> 08:00.479
This is very, very bad.

08:00.855 --> 08:04.524
The boar-spirit came from far to the west.

08:04.942 --> 08:08.778
A poison within him goaded him on,
rotting his flesh...

08:09.071 --> 08:14.951
...drawing evil as he ran,
making a demon of him.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.454
Prince Ashitaka...

08:18.789 --> 08:21.124
show us your right arm.

08:29.717 --> 08:30.759
Oracle!

08:32.010 --> 08:37.057
Ashitaka, are you
ready to face your destiny?

08:37.265 --> 08:40.809
Yes. I was resolved
when I let my arrow fly.

08:43.063 --> 08:47.317
The poison will seep into
your bones and you will die.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.157
Can nothing be done?!

08:54.283 --> 08:57.536
He fought for the women
and the village!

08:57.662 --> 08:59.955
To simply wait for death...

09:00.748 --> 09:03.083
We cannot change our fate.

09:03.376 --> 09:07.087
But we can rise to meet it.

09:07.755 --> 09:08.922
Look.

09:11.342 --> 09:14.469
This was deep in the boar's body.

09:15.012 --> 09:17.806
His suffering was terrible.

09:17.932 --> 09:21.017
The iron shattered his bones
and tore his entrails.

09:21.143 --> 09:23.853
What else could have
made him that way?

09:25.022 --> 09:28.817
Something sinister waits
in the lands to the west.

09:29.360 --> 09:34.155
If you journey there and
search for evil with eyes unclouded...

09:34.657 --> 09:38.285
you might find
a way to lift the curse.

09:40.538 --> 09:43.248
More than 500 years have passed...

09:43.374 --> 09:47.377
since the Emperor
drove us into this land.

09:47.503 --> 09:51.089
Now we hear how his power fades...

09:51.215 --> 09:54.676
and the fangs
of his Shoguns are broken.

09:55.011 --> 09:59.681
But the blood of our tribe
likewise grows thin.

10:00.266 --> 10:05.312
And now, bitter fate...
the youth who was one day to lead us

10:05.479 --> 10:08.815
must journey far to the west.

10:24.498 --> 10:29.002
The Law forbids us
to watch you go. Farewell.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.494
- Ashitaka.
- Kaya, you can't be here.

11:02.995 --> 11:06.998
I don't care.
Remember me with this.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.713
Your jewel dagger.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.508
It will protect you.

11:16.717 --> 11:21.471
You'll always be in my heart.
Always, without fail.

11:21.889 --> 11:24.724
And you in mine, Kaya.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.732
Fighting?

13:04.200 --> 13:05.366
Head them off!

13:08.370 --> 13:10.163
There's one, get him!

13:10.498 --> 13:12.248
His head is mine!

13:23.010 --> 13:24.052
Stop!

13:32.186 --> 13:33.853
My arm!

13:35.147 --> 13:37.607
Don't let him get away.

13:38.025 --> 13:40.193
Stay back. Let me pass!

13:55.167 --> 13:56.626
A demon!

14:09.849 --> 14:11.808
The mark is getting darker.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.822
This gruel tastes like hot water.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.828
There he is!

14:38.419 --> 14:39.586
Is this enough?

14:39.712 --> 14:42.005
This isn't money.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.382
Give me back my rice!

14:44.758 --> 14:47.427
Here, let me take a look.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.892
Woman, this is pure gold!

14:55.019 --> 14:58.187
If it's coins
you want, I'll pay you.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.647
Give me this.

15:00.274 --> 15:04.027
Listen, is there
a money-changer here?

15:04.737 --> 15:05.945
No?

15:06.363 --> 15:11.701
I'm a simple priest, but I'd say
this is worth three sacks of rice.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.119
Hey, wait!

15:13.287 --> 15:15.163
That's mine, give it back!

15:15.789 --> 15:19.417
Wait, don't be in such a hurry.

15:20.169 --> 15:25.548
No need to thank me.
It is I who should thank you.

15:25.841 --> 15:30.178
I saw how you dealt
with those samurai.

15:30.888 --> 15:34.891
You fight like one possessed.

15:38.312 --> 15:42.357
You see them too?
Keep your gold hidden.

15:42.900 --> 15:46.110
Hearts have grown hard
throughout the land.

15:46.987 --> 15:49.739
They'll rob you in your sleep.
Shall we run?

16:00.876 --> 16:04.379
So the boar became a demon...

16:04.838 --> 16:09.842
I followed its tracks,
but lost them in the village.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.344
I'm not surprised.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.054
Look around you.

16:13.889 --> 16:19.060
This used to be
a fine village.

16:19.395 --> 16:24.357
There was a flood, maybe,
or a landslide. I'm sure many died.

16:25.859 --> 16:29.487
The land teems with bitter ghosts...

16:29.697 --> 16:33.950
...dead from war, sick or starved
and fallen where they stood.

16:34.201 --> 16:38.204
A curse, you say? This world is a curse.

16:40.874 --> 16:42.709
Ah, this is good!

16:44.378 --> 16:48.172
I shouldn't have gotten into
that fight. I killed two men.

16:48.298 --> 16:50.758
You helped me escape.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.720
Give me your bowl.
You need food.

16:54.221 --> 16:55.513
Everyone dies.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.016
Some now, some later.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.393
Hmm, an elegant bowl.

17:00.936 --> 17:05.522
You remind me of
the Emishi of old.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.651
A brave people
far to the east...

17:09.028 --> 17:12.780
who used stone arrowheads
and rode red elk.

17:19.246 --> 17:22.165
The trick is to
avoid the jaws of death.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.667
Or so my master used to say.

17:25.919 --> 17:28.463
Eat, my boy. It's your rice.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.633
Look at this.

17:37.097 --> 17:38.139
What is it?

17:38.515 --> 17:40.725
It was in the body of the giant boar.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.978
This is what killed him.

17:53.989 --> 17:57.075
Far to the west,
deep in the mountains...

17:57.201 --> 18:01.120
is a forest
where none may tread.

18:01.371 --> 18:04.332
- The forest of the Deer God.
- The Deer God?

18:04.500 --> 18:09.170
They say the beasts there
are giants, as in ages past.

18:43.705 --> 18:45.498
I knew he'd go...

19:17.865 --> 19:21.200
It's not far now.
Stay on your guard.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.536
They're coming.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.037
The wolves!

19:32.588 --> 19:35.923
Calm the oxen. Don't rush.
Form ranks.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.176
Keep your powder dry!

19:38.760 --> 19:40.678
Wait until they're close.

19:47.978 --> 19:50.062
Number One, fire!

20:07.998 --> 20:09.749
Number Two, fire!

20:16.381 --> 20:18.716
That was too easy.

20:18.926 --> 20:22.220
Those were just the pups.
Where's the mother?

20:29.144 --> 20:30.353
It's Moro.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.277
Come on, Moro!

20:52.000 --> 20:53.209
Got her!

20:53.335 --> 20:56.796
She's immortal.
She won't die from that.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.305
She did some real damage.

21:06.473 --> 21:07.890
Let's get going.

21:08.058 --> 21:09.767
What about those who fell?

21:09.893 --> 21:11.560
Form ranks and move out.

21:31.832 --> 21:32.999
He's breathing.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.251
Hang on!

22:37.397 --> 22:41.317
My name is Ashitaka!
I come from the east.

22:41.735 --> 22:45.571
Are you ancient gods
from the forest of the Deer God?

23:02.047 --> 23:03.172
Leave!

23:23.276 --> 23:26.112
A kodama? Are they here, too?

23:28.240 --> 23:30.991
Don't move. You're hurt.

23:36.164 --> 23:39.875
They won't harm you.
They're a sign the woods are healthy.

23:40.293 --> 23:42.253
They'll bring the Deer God.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.630
The Deer God? The giant wolf?

23:44.881 --> 23:48.801
No, far bigger. The mother of all beasts.

23:50.637 --> 23:52.430
It's gone!

23:58.270 --> 24:01.939
Yakul's not afraid.
There's no danger here.

24:03.942 --> 24:07.194
Please let us pass
through your woods.

24:19.499 --> 24:21.375
Let's go back. Please!

24:22.043 --> 24:26.464
There's a trail across the river.
We'll never get through these woods.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.008
The current's too strong to cross.

24:29.217 --> 24:32.970
If we don't get help soon,
this man will die.

24:38.185 --> 24:41.770
Are you guiding us
or getting us lost?

24:56.703 --> 25:00.206
Sir, these sprites
aren't helping us.

25:00.540 --> 25:02.333
There are more of them!

25:22.270 --> 25:25.814
What a magnificent tree.
Is she your mother?

26:07.232 --> 26:11.777
That girl and the wolves...
so this is where they live...

26:12.279 --> 26:16.865
We're getting in deeper, sir.
This way leads into the other world.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.285
Yes, let's take a rest.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.131
Footprints.

26:38.430 --> 26:42.600
Three toes... still fresh.

27:36.279 --> 27:37.821
What's wrong, sir?

28:11.231 --> 28:15.150
Are you all right?
You're awfully pale.

28:16.194 --> 28:17.736
I told you!

28:18.029 --> 28:19.947
Did you see something?

28:20.407 --> 28:21.699
No, forget it.

28:23.201 --> 28:25.869
Hang on a little longer.

28:26.079 --> 28:27.579
I'm sorry.

28:34.254 --> 28:36.004
It's gone.

28:38.258 --> 28:41.969
What is this? I feel much stronger.

28:42.303 --> 28:44.763
Hey! It doesn't hurt.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.767
I'm cured! No, it's broken.

28:54.357 --> 28:58.819
Sir, you're a genius.
We're back at the ironworks!

29:30.977 --> 29:34.354
- It's a castle.
- Lady Eboshi's ironworks.

29:34.481 --> 29:37.483
They melt sand into iron.

29:37.901 --> 29:42.154
Hey!

29:43.490 --> 29:46.408
- Someone's coming from the woods!
- A monster?

29:47.202 --> 29:50.829
It's me, Koroku the ox-driver!

29:55.001 --> 29:57.669
It's true, he's crossing the lake!

29:59.255 --> 30:03.300
What's all this noise?
Be quiet when I'm writing.

30:03.426 --> 30:06.345
Koroku's back from the dead!

30:06.471 --> 30:07.596
What?

30:19.859 --> 30:21.318
You're not a ghost.

30:21.444 --> 30:24.363
- Where are the others?
- There were two more.

30:24.989 --> 30:26.615
Only we were saved.

30:30.036 --> 30:32.037
The guards never get killed.

30:32.205 --> 30:33.664
Step aside.

30:34.040 --> 30:37.376
Who's the man in the hood, sir?

30:37.585 --> 30:39.253
An outsider.

30:40.672 --> 30:46.009
Riflemen, listen! This gentleman
carried us all the way here.

30:46.553 --> 30:48.095
Show some gratitude.

30:48.638 --> 30:51.640
Ouch! Don't grab me there.

30:53.601 --> 30:56.144
You! Wait there!

31:08.032 --> 31:10.909
First, I thank you
for helping our men.

31:11.160 --> 31:13.078
But something bothers me.

31:13.413 --> 31:16.915
You got here in less than
half the time we did...

31:17.041 --> 31:20.210
...through the Deer God's forest,
carrying two...

31:20.336 --> 31:22.754
Koroku! You're alive!

31:22.881 --> 31:24.298
Toki!

31:28.177 --> 31:31.847
You fool! How can you drive
oxen with that broken leg?

31:31.973 --> 31:33.098
But...

31:33.266 --> 31:37.311
Scaring me half to death!
The wolves should've eaten you.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.479
Then I could find a better man.

31:39.606 --> 31:42.566
Don't be so hard on me, Toki.

31:42.775 --> 31:45.527
Toki, take your lovers'
quarrel elsewhere.

31:46.571 --> 31:49.072
And you, leaving them to die!

31:49.574 --> 31:52.784
Some guard you are.
You don't lift a finger around here.

31:52.952 --> 31:54.870
When there's trouble, do something!

31:54.996 --> 31:56.914
It couldn't be helped...

31:57.040 --> 32:00.584
Thank you. My husband's an idiot,
but I'm glad he's safe.

32:01.002 --> 32:04.755
Good. I was afraid maybe
I'd done something wrong.

32:08.760 --> 32:12.763
You seem very handsome.
Show us your face.

32:12.889 --> 32:13.847
Gonza.

32:15.183 --> 32:19.102
I would like to thank the traveler.
Bring him to me later.

32:19.479 --> 32:20.479
Koroku.

32:21.856 --> 32:24.858
It's good you're back. I apologize.

32:26.319 --> 32:30.489
Don't say that, Lady Eboshi.
He'll just take advantage of you.

32:31.115 --> 32:35.494
Forgive me, Toki.
I shouldn't have let it happen.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.163
My lady, if you
hadn't been there...

32:38.289 --> 32:41.500
they'd all be cavorting inside
the wolves by now.

32:43.795 --> 32:46.922
Traveler, please stop and rest.

32:51.928 --> 32:54.262
Hey! You are handsome!

33:21.874 --> 33:24.918
We had to fight off Moro
to bring this rice, you know.

33:25.044 --> 33:26.545
Dish it out!

33:28.464 --> 33:29.715
Where?

33:30.091 --> 33:31.299
Is that him?

33:31.926 --> 33:33.844
Toki was right!

33:33.970 --> 33:36.263
- He is handsome!
- A bit young.

33:36.639 --> 33:38.807
That never stopped you before.

33:39.517 --> 33:41.727
Quiet out there. We lost two men.

33:41.894 --> 33:44.104
There are plenty of handsome men here.

33:44.272 --> 33:46.106
Cowherds!

33:46.232 --> 33:51.278
Come to our place, traveler!
Forget this stinking barn.

33:51.571 --> 33:55.991
Watch your mouth! We risked our lives
for the rice you're eating.

33:56.117 --> 33:59.119
Who made the iron
that bought the rice?

33:59.245 --> 34:01.747
We work those bellows all night long.

34:02.498 --> 34:05.625
I'd like to see where you work,
if you don't mind.

34:05.793 --> 34:06.543
Really?

34:06.669 --> 34:08.920
We'll have to work in makeup.

34:09.088 --> 34:10.755
Even rouge!

34:11.841 --> 34:14.842
Don't forget, we'll be waiting.

34:16.094 --> 34:18.679
Don't mind them, sir.

34:20.016 --> 34:22.601
Lady Eboshi spoils them.

34:22.851 --> 34:25.103
A good village has happy women.

34:25.605 --> 34:28.607
But women working the bellows
in an ironworks?

34:28.858 --> 34:31.860
Their presence defiles the iron.

34:32.195 --> 34:36.364
When she finds girls sold as slaves,
Eboshi buys their freedom.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.492
She's kind, that's all.

34:38.618 --> 34:40.534
There's rice on your face, old man.

34:40.661 --> 34:44.664
But she's not afraid
of ancient laws, or of curses.

34:44.791 --> 34:47.667
Or of wolves, either.

34:47.877 --> 34:50.712
You should've seen her
fighting Nago!

34:50.838 --> 34:51.797
Nago?

34:51.964 --> 34:55.884
A huge boar-god. He ruled
the forest around here.

34:56.135 --> 34:58.637
We couldn't go into the mountains.

34:58.971 --> 35:02.265
All we could do was
look up at them.

35:03.601 --> 35:06.144
We used up the iron
in the sand by the lake.

35:06.646 --> 35:11.191
Many people had their eye on this
place. The boars got them all.

35:11.442 --> 35:15.153
To get sand, we have to
clear the trees.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.447
Nago went wild.

35:33.589 --> 35:36.591
There they go again!

35:38.010 --> 35:41.888
Then Lady Eboshi came along
with her muskets.

36:09.041 --> 36:11.001
Sir? What's wrong?

36:14.463 --> 36:16.131
Does your arm hurt?

36:16.382 --> 36:19.384
I was thinking about that boar.

36:19.844 --> 36:23.180
He must have died full of hate.

36:29.353 --> 36:32.147
I'm sorry I kept you
waiting, Ashitaka.

36:32.273 --> 36:33.607
That's good iron.

36:34.275 --> 36:36.735
We had to make
tomorrow's shipment.

36:39.447 --> 36:42.115
Let's rest now. Tell the others.

36:43.576 --> 36:47.329
Some think you're spying
for the samurai, or the monsters.

36:48.456 --> 36:50.916
There are many
who covet our iron.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.585
May I ask why you're here?

37:00.051 --> 37:01.927
You must recognize this.

37:02.762 --> 37:07.933
It shattered the bones of a giant boar,
rotted his flesh and made him a monster.

37:08.476 --> 37:13.438
When I tried to stop him, I was left
with this scar, a curse unto death.

37:13.898 --> 37:17.442
Where is your land? I've never seen
an elk like yours.

37:18.152 --> 37:21.571
Between north and east.
That's all I will say.

37:21.697 --> 37:25.450
Why, you! Answer her
or I'll cut you in two!

37:26.160 --> 37:28.787
And when you find
the one who made that?

37:30.122 --> 37:32.666
I will see with eyes unclouded,
and decide.

37:33.376 --> 37:35.168
Eyes unclouded?

37:40.258 --> 37:41.508
I see.

37:41.634 --> 37:44.052
I'll show you my secret. Come.

37:44.178 --> 37:45.303
Lady Eboshi!

37:45.471 --> 37:47.222
Take over, Gonza.

38:48.534 --> 38:51.369
No one dares enter this garden.

38:51.871 --> 38:54.039
Come, if you would
know my secret.

39:02.465 --> 39:03.673
We're coming in.

39:11.265 --> 39:13.558
We just finished.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.478
It's still heavy.

39:16.604 --> 39:19.356
It's light in your hands.

39:19.774 --> 39:22.359
If the barrel's
too thin, it will burst.

39:22.735 --> 39:27.072
It's not just for me.
The women will be using them.

39:27.656 --> 39:29.574
Won't that be a sight!

39:29.950 --> 39:33.328
This is the new musket
these people have designed.

39:33.496 --> 39:35.705
Chinese muskets are too heavy.

39:36.290 --> 39:39.709
This will kill monsters
and pierce samurai armor.

39:40.127 --> 39:44.089
Watch out. Lady Eboshi
wants to rule the country.

39:44.840 --> 39:48.009
I'm sorry to rush you.
I'll send sake later.

39:48.135 --> 39:49.844
Won't that be nice!

39:51.597 --> 39:55.183
You stole the boar's woods
and made a monster of him.

39:55.434 --> 39:58.853
Will you breed new hatred
and evil with those weapons?

39:59.772 --> 40:01.815
I'm sorry you suffer.

40:01.982 --> 40:04.776
The musket ball you found is mine.

40:05.236 --> 40:08.863
That hapless boar
should have cursed me instead.

40:26.549 --> 40:29.592
Your right hand wants to kill me?

40:30.094 --> 40:32.470
Perhaps that would lift this curse.

40:32.596 --> 40:35.140
But my hand would not be stayed.

40:35.641 --> 40:38.268
Must it kill us all to find peace?

40:38.686 --> 40:42.772
My lady, Osa wants
to say something.

40:43.441 --> 40:48.361
Lady Eboshi, do not scorn
the young man's strength.

40:49.321 --> 40:53.158
Young man, I too am cursed.

40:53.284 --> 40:56.911
I understand your rage and grief...

40:57.204 --> 41:01.207
but I beg you
not to kill our lady.

41:01.834 --> 41:07.964
She is the only person
who ever treated us as human.

41:08.799 --> 41:11.217
She did not fear our disease.

41:11.385 --> 41:15.847
She washed and bandaged our flesh.

41:19.018 --> 41:23.938
- Osa...
- Life is suffering and pain.

41:24.273 --> 41:28.526
This world and its people are
cursed, but we still wish to live.

41:28.652 --> 41:31.446
Forgive my foolish babbling.

41:50.883 --> 41:52.425
They're back.

41:53.219 --> 41:58.097
They come at night to plant trees
and take back the mountain.

41:58.390 --> 42:01.601
Ashitaka, will you stay,
and work with me?

42:02.436 --> 42:04.854
Would you seize even
the Deer God's forest?

42:05.272 --> 42:09.192
Without the ancient gods,
the wild ones are mere beasts.

42:09.902 --> 42:14.989
With the forest and wolves gone,
this will be a land of riches.

42:15.241 --> 42:17.575
Even Princess Mononoke
will be human again.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.244
Princess Mononoke?

42:19.745 --> 42:22.914
The wild girl whose soul
the wolves stole.

42:23.165 --> 42:25.625
She lives to kill me.

42:30.965 --> 42:34.467
The blood of the Deer God
is said to cure disease.

42:34.802 --> 42:40.265
Perhaps it could cure
these people, even lift your curse.

42:40.391 --> 42:41.849
Lady Eboshi!

42:42.560 --> 42:44.269
How does it handle?

42:44.687 --> 42:47.939
Very well made.
Perfect for conquering the country.

42:48.065 --> 42:51.776
- But still a bit heavy.
- Hard to please.

43:18.721 --> 43:20.847
Look who's here!

43:21.181 --> 43:23.474
Toki, let me try the bellows.

43:24.101 --> 43:25.143
Wait!

43:27.980 --> 43:29.355
May I try?

43:30.733 --> 43:32.817
Let him see what it's like.

43:39.992 --> 43:41.993
What strength!

43:45.414 --> 43:47.206
You really came!

43:47.583 --> 43:49.334
I told you he's an handsome man.

43:49.543 --> 43:52.128
Look, she's fixing her kimono!

43:53.714 --> 43:56.049
You'll never keep up that pace, traveler.

43:56.967 --> 43:58.426
It's hard work.

43:58.761 --> 44:01.179
Yes, we work four days straight.

44:01.889 --> 44:03.806
Is life hard here?

44:04.016 --> 44:08.353
Yes, but it's better than
in the towns.

44:08.854 --> 44:12.315
We eat our fill
and the men know their place.

44:12.775 --> 44:13.900
I see.

44:59.571 --> 45:02.073
- You're leaving tomorrow?
- You should stay longer.

45:02.199 --> 45:03.741
You can help us.

45:03.909 --> 45:07.120
Thank you, but there is
someone I must meet.

45:13.585 --> 45:15.086
She's here.

45:20.551 --> 45:22.051
Princess Mononoke!

46:00.090 --> 46:01.090
It's her!

46:01.967 --> 46:02.800
Stop!

46:03.969 --> 46:05.428
I don't want to fight you!

46:10.684 --> 46:12.685
She's after the Lady!

46:23.363 --> 46:27.700
Stoke the fires.
Riflemen, keep her inside!

46:28.160 --> 46:31.037
Steady at your posts!

46:31.455 --> 46:33.331
She's up on the roof.

46:33.832 --> 46:36.417
Don't get excited. Keep working.

46:36.668 --> 46:38.544
We must keep the fire going.

46:39.421 --> 46:43.049
- Is she alone?
- Yes. We have her cornered.

46:43.300 --> 46:45.343
She came for you.

46:45.511 --> 46:47.720
All right, let's go.

46:56.772 --> 47:00.608
Can you hear me,
Princess Mononoke? Here I am.

47:01.777 --> 47:04.278
You wish to avenge your tribe.

47:04.988 --> 47:08.991
There are some here who seek
vengeance for husbands...

47:09.117 --> 47:11.244
killed by your wolves.

47:11.495 --> 47:14.080
Come out!
We have scores to settle!

47:24.091 --> 47:25.466
There she is!

47:27.302 --> 47:28.761
Surrender, Princess Mononoke!

47:28.887 --> 47:31.973
Stay out of the line of fire!

47:38.897 --> 47:40.773
It's a trap. Stop!

47:41.942 --> 47:45.903
Wolf princess,
go back to your woods!

47:49.366 --> 47:52.243
Don't die for nothing.
Go back!

47:52.786 --> 47:54.078
I knew it!

47:54.204 --> 47:56.205
Let him do as he likes.

48:17.394 --> 48:19.270
Got her! She's falling.

48:19.771 --> 48:20.771
Don't move.

48:21.523 --> 48:24.191
A wolf's severed head
can still bite.

48:26.236 --> 48:27.945
Aim where she falls.

48:46.965 --> 48:48.007
Fire!

48:56.683 --> 48:58.476
Stay back!

49:07.235 --> 49:08.319
Wake up!

49:14.284 --> 49:15.451
No!

49:34.513 --> 49:35.721
Get her!

49:35.847 --> 49:37.640
Don't let her go.

49:37.808 --> 49:39.100
Kill her!

49:42.771 --> 49:45.106
Are you all right, sir?

49:54.366 --> 49:56.367
Don't worry about me. Go!

50:02.582 --> 50:05.751
Villain! You're one of them too.

50:08.463 --> 50:09.505
Halt!

50:13.719 --> 50:14.927
Step aside.

50:32.112 --> 50:33.946
What are you doing, Ashitaka?

50:34.114 --> 50:36.073
Her life is mine.

50:37.868 --> 50:40.036
Will you marry the wolf princess?

50:40.370 --> 50:43.622
There is a demon inside you.
And in her.

50:49.254 --> 50:53.591
Look! This is the hatred
and bitterness that curses me!

50:54.426 --> 50:57.094
It rots my flesh
and summons my death.

50:58.138 --> 51:00.097
You cannot yield to it.

51:00.599 --> 51:03.017
Enough talk of your curse.

51:03.143 --> 51:04.935
I'll cut that arm off!

51:10.192 --> 51:11.400
Lady Eboshi!

51:14.279 --> 51:16.197
Someone help me.

51:22.120 --> 51:24.705
Don't worry. She'll recover.

51:29.961 --> 51:32.129
I will take the girl!

51:32.798 --> 51:36.133
Wait! You hurt Lady Eboshi!

51:39.346 --> 51:40.513
Don't move!

51:52.484 --> 51:53.526
Kiyo, no!

51:59.658 --> 52:01.075
He still lives...

52:07.415 --> 52:09.750
- And Lady Eboshi?
- Safe, sir.

52:10.085 --> 52:13.921
Bring me my musket.
Sharpshooters, fall in!

52:14.297 --> 52:16.006
They won't get away.

52:17.342 --> 52:18.717
Toki, quick!

52:24.224 --> 52:25.891
You're...

52:40.991 --> 52:42.700
Sir, you may not pass.

52:43.201 --> 52:45.703
The gate may not be
opened without orders.

52:49.374 --> 52:50.708
Please turn back.

52:50.834 --> 52:54.378
You helped us.
We don't want to harm you.

52:55.672 --> 52:59.508
I will leave as I came,
of my own will.

53:01.136 --> 53:04.013
No... it takes ten men
to open that gate.

53:12.439 --> 53:14.023
Sir, no! You'll die!

53:23.617 --> 53:24.783
It's moving...

53:31.625 --> 53:33.459
Out of the way!

53:37.297 --> 53:38.380
Wolves!

53:38.798 --> 53:40.007
Flint! Flint!

53:40.342 --> 53:42.885
Stop. Your princess is safe!

53:45.805 --> 53:47.097
We're coming.

53:47.265 --> 53:48.515
Yakul, let's go.

53:53.521 --> 53:54.855
Thank you.

54:01.947 --> 54:03.489
He's gone.

54:26.304 --> 54:27.429
Wait!

54:29.349 --> 54:30.891
He's mine.

54:42.529 --> 54:46.156
Did they shoot you?
Are you going to die?

54:49.911 --> 54:53.330
Why did you stop me?
Speak while you still live!

54:55.083 --> 54:57.835
I didn't want you to die.

54:58.169 --> 55:02.089
I'm not afraid to die
if it will drive away the humans!

55:02.716 --> 55:05.592
I knew that when I first saw you.

55:05.719 --> 55:08.679
You've wasted your life
by getting in my way!

55:12.934 --> 55:16.353
I'll cut your throat!
That'll shut you up.

55:17.689 --> 55:18.856
Live...

55:19.107 --> 55:21.483
I don't listen to humans!

55:23.236 --> 55:24.987
You're beautiful...

55:29.200 --> 55:33.037
What's wrong, San?
Shall I tear him apart?

55:44.883 --> 55:46.216
It's the apes.

55:47.510 --> 55:51.805
Apes! Do you insult
the tribe of Moro?

55:53.016 --> 55:55.059
This forest ours.

55:55.185 --> 55:57.269
Give us man.

55:57.395 --> 56:00.773
Give us man and go.

56:00.899 --> 56:03.400
Be gone before my fangs find you.

56:03.735 --> 56:05.361
Go.

56:05.487 --> 56:07.613
We eat man.

56:07.822 --> 56:09.406
We eat him.

56:09.699 --> 56:11.533
Let us eat man.

56:11.659 --> 56:15.621
Why would the tribe of the apes...

56:15.830 --> 56:18.123
...want to eat a man?

56:18.833 --> 56:23.087
We eat man. We get his strength.

56:23.254 --> 56:26.924
We get strength
to drive humans away.

56:27.217 --> 56:31.095
You won't get that power
by eating a man.

56:31.513 --> 56:35.557
All that will do is defile you
and turn you into something else!

56:35.975 --> 56:40.062
We plant trees. Humans kill them.

56:40.230 --> 56:45.192
Forest not come back.
We kill humans.

56:45.693 --> 56:49.613
The Deer God is with us.
Don't give up. Plant your trees.

56:49.823 --> 56:52.199
Moro's tribe is fighting for you!

56:52.659 --> 56:56.578
Deer God not fight. We die.

56:56.704 --> 57:00.207
Wolf girl not care. Wolf girl human.

57:01.751 --> 57:04.962
Monkey! I'll break your neck!

57:08.299 --> 57:09.425
Stop it!

57:18.309 --> 57:19.977
It's all right.

57:20.186 --> 57:24.148
You go ahead.
I'll deal with the human.

57:24.399 --> 57:25.649
What about him?

57:26.151 --> 57:27.693
Can we eat him?

57:30.613 --> 57:32.990
No, you can't. Now go on.

57:40.540 --> 57:42.708
Come here. Let's be friends.

57:43.626 --> 57:46.879
Help me carry your master.

59:42.287 --> 59:46.039
You're smart. You know
not to set foot on this island.

59:47.792 --> 59:49.293
That human stench.

59:59.470 --> 01:00:01.805
Go where you will. You're free.

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:36.858
There he is!

01:01:36.984 --> 01:01:39.611
At last, the Nightwalker!

01:01:40.238 --> 01:01:41.947
Quick, come and look.

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:45.826
That's why we've been sitting
in these stinking bearskins.

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:48.662
Don't look, you'll go blind!

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:51.915
And you call yourselves hunters?

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:54.835
This decree from the Emperor...

01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:57.921
...allows us to subdue the Deer God!

01:02:03.594 --> 01:02:06.263
Now he's the Nightwalker.

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:11.435
When day begins,
he becomes a deer again.

01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:13.895
He's going in. There!

01:03:36.771 --> 01:03:39.189
- Jiko!
- I saw them.

01:03:40.566 --> 01:03:41.691
Over there.

01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:57.249
There must be hundreds of them.

01:03:57.375 --> 01:03:59.584
They're not from these woods.

01:03:59.794 --> 01:04:02.587
They're lords of some other forest.

01:04:10.304 --> 01:04:11.930
It's Okkoto!

01:04:12.056 --> 01:04:14.766
He swam across the straits?

01:04:14.892 --> 01:04:17.060
No other boar has those tusks.

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:19.855
He brought his whole tribe.

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:25.569
He knows we're here. Run!

01:04:38.749 --> 01:04:40.917
Come on, jump!

01:05:34.388 --> 01:05:35.639
There's no wound.

01:05:46.192 --> 01:05:47.567
Yakul...

01:06:11.175 --> 01:06:15.512
If you're awake, thank Yakul.
He never left your side.

01:06:17.348 --> 01:06:19.265
You know his name?

01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:25.188
He told me all about you,
about your village and its forest.

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:29.192
I'll help you, because
the Deer God saved your life.

01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:34.990
I had a dream... a golden deer...

01:06:35.116 --> 01:06:36.032
Eat this.

01:06:41.872 --> 01:06:42.914
Chew.

01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:16.091
We're here to kill humans
and save the forest.

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:18.426
Why are humans here?

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:20.595
She is San, my daughter.

01:08:20.845 --> 01:08:23.139
There are humans everywhere.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:26.684
Go back to your homeland
and kill them there.

01:08:27.144 --> 01:08:30.395
We kill for the forest
of the Deer God.

01:08:30.898 --> 01:08:33.149
Why is the man here?

01:08:33.984 --> 01:08:38.113
The Deer God healed him.
He should leave here alive.

01:08:38.322 --> 01:08:43.493
The Deer God saved him?
The Deer God healed a human?

01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:46.912
Why did he not save Nago?

01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:51.000
Does the Deer God not protect
all in the forest?

01:08:51.335 --> 01:08:55.171
The Deer God gives life
and takes it away.

01:08:55.296 --> 01:08:59.216
Have you boars forgotten that?

01:08:59.551 --> 01:09:03.805
You begrudge us
the Deer God's favor.

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:05.974
You did nothing to help Nago!

01:09:06.433 --> 01:09:10.478
He feared death, as do I.

01:09:11.188 --> 01:09:14.983
I also carry within me
a poisoned human stone.

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:19.444
Nago fled. I will stay
here and face my death.

01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:21.363
Ask the Deer God for help.

01:09:21.532 --> 01:09:24.701
I have lived long enough, San.

01:09:24.868 --> 01:09:28.328
The Deer God would
probably take my life.

01:09:28.706 --> 01:09:31.582
No, Mother!
You protect the Deer God.

01:09:32.042 --> 01:09:35.377
You lie!
Nago was beautiful and strong.

01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:37.005
Our brother would never run.

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:40.300
You wolves ate him!

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:43.553
Silence! You slander my mother!

01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:46.805
Hear me, all of you.

01:09:47.725 --> 01:09:50.685
It was I who killed Nago.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:55.148
He became a demon
and attacked our village.

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:59.444
A huge boar. Here is my proof.

01:10:05.075 --> 01:10:09.162
I came to this land to ask
the Deer God to lift this curse.

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:13.958
He healed my wound,
but Nago's curse remains.

01:10:15.502 --> 01:10:19.380
I must suffer until
his curse destroys me.

01:10:24.345 --> 01:10:28.348
Ah, it's Okkoto.
Finally, someone with some sense.

01:10:33.103 --> 01:10:34.145
Okkoto, wait!

01:10:34.605 --> 01:10:36.272
You mustn't eat him.

01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:42.820
You are Moro's daughter.
I have heard of you.

01:10:44.281 --> 01:10:45.823
Your eyes...

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:49.035
Stand back. I will not eat him.

01:10:49.536 --> 01:10:50.828
Wolf Princess...

01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:55.291
Fear not. I tell of Nago's end.

01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:11.933
My thanks to you, young one.

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:18.314
It grieves us that our tribe
spawned a demon.

01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:24.153
Lord Okkoto,
how I may lift the curse?

01:11:25.322 --> 01:11:26.656
Leave this forest.

01:11:26.824 --> 01:11:30.910
If we meet again,
I must kill you.

01:11:31.203 --> 01:11:35.748
You cannot win against
the fire stones of the humans.

01:11:35.916 --> 01:11:41.337
Look on my tribe, Moro.
We grow small and stupid.

01:11:41.505 --> 01:11:44.924
Soon we will be nothing more...

01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:47.635
...than game
for the humans to hunt.

01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:52.598
If you stake everything on one battle,
you'll play into their hands.

01:11:53.017 --> 01:11:56.269
I seek no help from wolves.

01:11:56.854 --> 01:12:03.026
Even if we all fall in battle,
we will leave the humans in awe.

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:30.053
The Deer God...

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:48.780
Keep the oxen together!

01:12:52.409 --> 01:12:54.285
Hold your fire. Let them come.

01:12:55.245 --> 01:12:56.120
Fire!

01:13:02.544 --> 01:13:03.920
Reload! Quick!

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:22.522
That damned Eboshi's fighting
the wrong enemy.

01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:25.358
Go on ahead and hide.

01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:48.965
It's them! They've returned.

01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:57.723
- Jiko!
- Well done.

01:13:58.392 --> 01:14:01.811
We're moving out. Tell the others.

01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:07.442
Hello, Jiko.

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:09.944
His Majesty is impatient.

01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:12.488
This is no time for sport
with country samurai.

01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:16.284
Lord Asano sends them against me.

01:14:16.743 --> 01:14:19.495
Asano? He's a powerful man.

01:14:19.746 --> 01:14:21.914
He wants half my iron.

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:24.125
How greedy of him.

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:27.295
This is no time to fight men.

01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:30.756
The boars are gathering
in the forest.

01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:33.634
Give Asano all your iron.

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:37.763
Keep your promise to
His Majesty, then smash Asano.

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:41.392
Quick, Lady Eboshi!
Asano's men are coming.

01:14:46.523 --> 01:14:49.358
Speak of the devil. A messenger.

01:14:49.526 --> 01:14:52.028
An envoy approaches.
Remember your manners.

01:14:55.365 --> 01:14:56.782
Welcome home!

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:01.746
Aren't you going to receive him?

01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:10.755
Mistress Eboshi
of the Ironworks, you fight well!

01:15:11.673 --> 01:15:16.385
I bring a message from my lord.
Open the gate!

01:15:16.553 --> 01:15:19.305
We can hear you from there.

01:15:19.681 --> 01:15:22.391
Our lady took this mountain
from the boars.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:24.894
Now it's worth something
and you want it.

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.312
On your way!

01:15:26.438 --> 01:15:29.315
You are impudent, woman!

01:15:29.566 --> 01:15:30.650
Impudent?

01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:34.237
We've been impudent
since the day we were born!

01:15:35.781 --> 01:15:38.074
You want iron? Take some!

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:49.168
Eboshi's women are quite impressive!

01:15:49.294 --> 01:15:52.213
Samurai or monsters, they don't care.

01:15:52.756 --> 01:15:56.342
They certainly don't lack for courage.

01:15:58.011 --> 01:16:00.096
What good is this paper?

01:16:00.472 --> 01:16:03.724
It's helped me get
the best hunters and trackers.

01:16:03.850 --> 01:16:06.686
We're after a god, not just beasts.

01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:09.981
Yes, my lady?

01:16:10.274 --> 01:16:12.858
Do you know who this comes from?

01:16:13.527 --> 01:16:16.529
- The Son of Heaven.
- The what?

01:16:17.864 --> 01:16:19.198
The Emperor.

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:23.077
Oh, it's nothing special.

01:16:23.662 --> 01:16:24.787
Off you go.

01:16:26.707 --> 01:16:31.085
The more we make iron,
the weaker the forest becomes.

01:16:31.211 --> 01:16:33.588
We lose fewer lives.

01:16:34.131 --> 01:16:36.591
We've spent too much time and money.

01:16:36.717 --> 01:16:40.636
We didn't send 40 sharpshooters
just for the iron.

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:43.681
At least that's what
His Majesty would say.

01:16:43.890 --> 01:16:49.103
Surely he doesn't believe that the
head of a god confers immortality?

01:16:49.354 --> 01:16:54.859
I'm not privy to his thoughts.
I prefer it that way.

01:16:55.944 --> 01:16:57.403
I'll keep my promise.

01:16:57.529 --> 01:17:02.116
Boars are easier to deal with
than Moro and her tribe.

01:17:02.909 --> 01:17:06.871
You can summon that shady bunch
hidden under the cliff.

01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:11.417
You saw them, did you?

01:17:11.543 --> 01:17:13.878
One more thing...

01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:16.672
Did a young man
pass through here?

01:17:17.174 --> 01:17:19.967
A strange youth, riding a red elk.

01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:21.802
He left.

01:17:41.448 --> 01:17:43.282
They look frightening.

01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:46.702
They're not ordinary hunters.
They're special scouts.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.039
Let us go with you.

01:17:50.165 --> 01:17:51.999
Don't trust those men!

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:55.211
We can't help you from here
if anything happens!

01:17:55.337 --> 01:17:57.254
We know how to shoot.

01:17:57.881 --> 01:18:00.883
That's why I need you here.

01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:04.512
I fear humans more than monsters.

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:08.599
With the Deer God dead,
things will become clear.

01:18:09.184 --> 01:18:13.396
Is the Deer God's head
all the Emperor really wants?

01:18:14.147 --> 01:18:17.983
We may have to fight
men with muskets, too.

01:18:18.819 --> 01:18:21.987
Men can't be trusted.
Stay on your toes.

01:18:22.781 --> 01:18:26.826
Don't worry about Lady Eboshi.
I'll protect her with my life.

01:18:27.077 --> 01:18:29.370
- I wonder.
- What!

01:18:29.496 --> 01:18:31.747
I'd believe that
coming from a woman!

01:19:42.027 --> 01:19:43.486
Are you suffering?

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:49.158
You could simply jump
and end the pain, you know.

01:19:49.284 --> 01:19:52.745
When your strength returns,
the curse will torment you.

01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:55.998
I feel like I've slept for days.

01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:59.752
I dreamed San
was watching over me.

01:20:00.086 --> 01:20:06.592
I hoped you would cry out in your
sleep, so I could bite off your head.

01:20:06.718 --> 01:20:08.344
These woods are beautiful.

01:20:08.678 --> 01:20:10.763
Are the boars moving yet?

01:20:11.139 --> 01:20:15.017
Go back into the cave, boy.
You can't hear it...

01:20:15.185 --> 01:20:18.270
The forest crying out
as the boars move forward.

01:20:19.105 --> 01:20:24.026
I hear the forest crying and
feel the wasting of my body...

01:20:24.194 --> 01:20:26.195
and I wait for that woman.

01:20:26.571 --> 01:20:30.366
I dream of crushing
her head in my jaws.

01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:34.161
Can't humans and
the forest live in peace?

01:20:34.704 --> 01:20:36.372
Can't this be stopped?

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:38.749
The humans are gathering.

01:20:38.917 --> 01:20:41.752
We're not safe, even here.

01:20:42.045 --> 01:20:45.256
And San? Will you force her
to die with you?

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:49.260
How like a human.
You think only of yourself.

01:20:49.719 --> 01:20:55.766
She is a daughter of our tribe.
If the woods die, so will she.

01:20:56.101 --> 01:20:58.519
Set her free! She's human.

01:20:58.979 --> 01:21:00.145
Silence, boy!

01:21:00.605 --> 01:21:03.232
What can you do for her?

01:21:04.401 --> 01:21:10.239
The humans who violated the forest
threw her in my path as they ran from me.

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:13.742
Now she is neither human nor wolf.

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:17.538
My poor, ugly, lovely daughter.

01:21:17.664 --> 01:21:19.665
Can you save her?

01:21:21.793 --> 01:21:24.879
I don't know,
but together we can live.

01:21:27.090 --> 01:21:32.052
How? Will you join San
and fight the humans?

01:21:32.596 --> 01:21:35.264
No. That will only
breed more hatred.

01:21:35.932 --> 01:21:40.227
There is nothing you can do.

01:21:40.437 --> 01:21:43.647
Soon Nago's curse will kill you.

01:21:43.773 --> 01:21:46.275
Leave this place at sunrise.

01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:01.540
Can you walk?

01:22:04.127 --> 01:22:07.046
Yes, thanks to you
and the Deer God.

01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:10.317
Yakul! Did you worry?

01:23:15.615 --> 01:23:17.616
My legs are still weak.

01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:52.276
It's too quiet.
Where are the kodama?

01:23:58.783 --> 01:24:01.410
I can smell the ironworks.

01:24:08.543 --> 01:24:11.920
Thank you for guiding me.
I have a favor to ask.

01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:16.425
Give this to San.

01:24:24.934 --> 01:24:25.893
Let's go.

01:24:57.592 --> 01:24:59.885
What a stench! I can't breathe.

01:25:00.011 --> 01:25:04.890
That's tracker's smoke.
It will blunt our sense of smell.

01:25:05.016 --> 01:25:06.058
It's her.

01:25:15.735 --> 01:25:19.696
- She knows we're here.
- It's a trap.

01:25:19.823 --> 01:25:20.697
Trap?

01:25:21.032 --> 01:25:25.160
They want to lure the boars
out of the woods.

01:25:25.286 --> 01:25:27.204
Everything has been planned.

01:25:27.413 --> 01:25:29.957
We've got to warn them.

01:25:30.083 --> 01:25:31.250
They'll die!

01:25:31.876 --> 01:25:34.086
Okkoto is no fool.

01:25:34.379 --> 01:25:38.715
The boars know it's a trap,
but still they'll charge.

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:41.426
They are a proud race.

01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:46.056
The last one alive
will keep charging forward.

01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:52.646
They're cutting trees.

01:25:52.856 --> 01:25:54.481
Another provocation.

01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.528
Mother, this is farewell.

01:25:59.904 --> 01:26:02.364
The smoke will blind Okkoto.

01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:04.408
I'll be his eyes.

01:26:05.118 --> 01:26:06.702
As you like, San.

01:26:07.036 --> 01:26:10.998
But there is a life for you
with that boy.

01:26:11.541 --> 01:26:12.958
I hate humans!

01:26:25.471 --> 01:26:27.389
From Ashitaka... for me?

01:26:31.769 --> 01:26:32.853
It's beautiful.

01:26:33.396 --> 01:26:35.355
You two go with San.

01:26:35.523 --> 01:26:38.066
I will stay with the Deer God.

01:26:38.359 --> 01:26:39.234
Let's go.

01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:04.051
The tribe of Moro fights with you!
Where is Okkoto?

01:27:07.222 --> 01:27:08.222
Thank you!

01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:35.600
It's coming from the ironworks.

01:28:41.274 --> 01:28:42.190
Let's go.

01:28:46.446 --> 01:28:47.529
Halt!

01:28:47.864 --> 01:28:48.822
Samurai!

01:28:50.783 --> 01:28:51.908
Halt!

01:28:52.785 --> 01:28:54.077
Let me pass!

01:29:10.887 --> 01:29:12.554
I don't believe it.

01:29:16.601 --> 01:29:18.685
He's fending them off.

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.438
Don't waste your arrows.

01:29:45.588 --> 01:29:46.630
Quick!

01:29:46.756 --> 01:29:49.633
- You're right, it is him.
- It's not a ghost.

01:29:49.926 --> 01:29:51.718
Ashitaka!

01:29:52.095 --> 01:29:54.596
Toki! Are you all right?

01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:56.306
Of course!

01:29:56.474 --> 01:30:00.685
They thought they'd catch us
while the men were away.

01:30:00.812 --> 01:30:02.062
We showed 'em!

01:30:02.438 --> 01:30:05.565
- They thought we'd be easy.
- Where's Lady Eboshi?

01:30:05.775 --> 01:30:09.986
She took every man
and went after the Deer God.

01:30:10.113 --> 01:30:12.364
We're trapped here and
can't reach her.

01:30:12.657 --> 01:30:15.575
The Deer God?
So that's what I heard.

01:30:16.119 --> 01:30:18.286
Sir, I've still got your bow.

01:30:18.454 --> 01:30:20.872
What about his saddle and cloak?

01:30:20.998 --> 01:30:22.874
- I forgot.
- You're useless!

01:30:23.292 --> 01:30:24.793
Koroku, thanks!

01:30:25.002 --> 01:30:27.879
I'll bring help. Can you hold on?

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:31.174
We'll pour hot iron
on them if we have to!

01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:34.428
- Hurry, Ashitaka!
- Bring Lady Eboshi.

01:30:40.143 --> 01:30:41.268
Missed!

01:30:41.394 --> 01:30:43.395
They're bringing boats. Hurry!

01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:47.315
Summon Lady Eboshi. We'll fight, too!

01:30:49.152 --> 01:30:51.069
I'll be back. Keep fighting!

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:55.657
We'll be here!

01:30:59.370 --> 01:31:01.705
Kill that man!

01:31:10.798 --> 01:31:12.799
They're after us, Yakul!

01:31:55.635 --> 01:31:57.385
Burning flesh...

01:32:03.684 --> 01:32:04.726
Yakul!

01:32:43.933 --> 01:32:45.183
Stay back!

01:32:57.738 --> 01:32:59.531
Show me the wound.

01:33:01.659 --> 01:33:04.452
Wait here. I'll be back.

01:33:07.164 --> 01:33:08.456
Stay, I said!

01:33:19.677 --> 01:33:21.344
We're almost there.

01:34:05.681 --> 01:34:07.098
Who goes there?

01:34:07.683 --> 01:34:11.227
You're not allowed here.

01:34:11.937 --> 01:34:16.733
I'm indebted to these men.
I have a message for Lady Eboshi.

01:34:17.026 --> 01:34:20.987
She's not here.
I'll see that she gets it.

01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:23.865
I will speak to her.
Where is she?

01:34:24.033 --> 01:34:27.369
Ashitaka, you made it after all!

01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:29.871
You've suffered badly.

01:34:29.997 --> 01:34:31.873
Some men are still buried.

01:34:31.999 --> 01:34:33.333
It was horrible.

01:34:33.834 --> 01:34:35.794
The ironworks are under attack.

01:34:36.545 --> 01:34:40.757
There's still time. The women are
holding the inner stockade.

01:34:40.966 --> 01:34:42.217
This cannot stand!

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:44.844
Asano waited until we left.

01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:46.805
Where's Lady Eboshi?

01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:49.724
She went after the Deer God.

01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:51.851
Call her back. There's no time!

01:34:52.353 --> 01:34:55.980
If you're finished, get moving.
Get back to work!

01:34:56.357 --> 01:34:57.565
And the ironworks?

01:34:57.692 --> 01:34:59.317
Now wait a minute!

01:34:59.819 --> 01:35:02.195
They're ready to sacrifice us all.

01:35:02.988 --> 01:35:06.574
- There's no time to lose.
- Send Eboshi a message!

01:35:06.701 --> 01:35:09.953
She's deep in the woods.
We'll never find her.

01:35:10.204 --> 01:35:12.956
Send one of your trackers, then.

01:35:13.416 --> 01:35:16.000
They're using Lady Eboshi.

01:35:16.752 --> 01:35:19.421
Were there any wolves with the boars?

01:35:20.089 --> 01:35:22.298
Have you seen Princess Mononoke?

01:35:22.508 --> 01:35:26.052
It was pitch black
when they came at us.

01:35:26.178 --> 01:35:27.470
She was there.

01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:31.099
We were on the front line...

01:35:31.308 --> 01:35:32.142
And?

01:35:32.268 --> 01:35:36.479
I don't know. All of a sudden,
the world turned upside down...

01:35:36.856 --> 01:35:40.066
The scouts put us there
to lure the boars in.

01:35:40.192 --> 01:35:42.235
There were mines underneath us...

01:35:42.361 --> 01:35:44.362
and grenades from above.

01:36:38.167 --> 01:36:39.334
Where's San?

01:36:43.589 --> 01:36:46.049
Be still, I want to help you.

01:36:49.595 --> 01:36:53.014
A wolf! There's a wolf
still alive over here.

01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:55.099
Sir, what are you...

01:36:59.522 --> 01:37:00.355
Sir!

01:37:00.481 --> 01:37:02.857
What are you doing, boy?

01:37:03.734 --> 01:37:07.612
He'll take me to Eboshi.

01:37:07.863 --> 01:37:09.948
So you're with them, are you?

01:37:10.908 --> 01:37:11.866
Step aside.

01:37:13.077 --> 01:37:16.287
Would you sacrifice
these men and their families?

01:37:17.373 --> 01:37:18.540
Poison darts!

01:37:24.713 --> 01:37:25.713
Stop!

01:37:32.638 --> 01:37:34.764
Give me a hand!

01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:46.234
He's free!

01:37:57.955 --> 01:38:00.832
Go through the swamp
and hide near the lake.

01:38:01.458 --> 01:38:04.294
They have sharpshooters.
Be careful.

01:38:04.753 --> 01:38:07.338
Take this. My last arrow broke.

01:38:10.009 --> 01:38:11.301
Go with them.

01:38:11.427 --> 01:38:12.677
Look after him!

01:38:16.849 --> 01:38:19.058
Find San. That's where Eboshi is.

01:38:30.946 --> 01:38:34.490
Keep up with the scouts.
We finish this today!

01:38:37.286 --> 01:38:38.119
Jiko!

01:38:38.287 --> 01:38:40.538
Well? How does it look?

01:38:40.789 --> 01:38:45.543
Okkoto's hurt. He and the girl
are going to the Deer God.

01:38:46.045 --> 01:38:49.547
So they're going to ask him
for help. Stay with them.

01:38:50.049 --> 01:38:52.592
Keep out of sight
or he won't appear.

01:38:52.718 --> 01:38:54.302
Of course.

01:38:55.721 --> 01:38:58.348
Was that boar blood on his face?

01:38:59.099 --> 01:39:02.018
It's a scout trick.
Revolting, isn't it?

01:39:09.944 --> 01:39:13.112
We're almost at
the Deer God's pond.

01:39:30.923 --> 01:39:32.173
Something's coming!

01:39:35.302 --> 01:39:38.429
Something's wrong, Okkoto!
We have to keep moving.

01:39:39.181 --> 01:39:40.765
Something bad is coming.

01:39:41.016 --> 01:39:43.643
I can't smell it.
There's too much blood.

01:39:48.983 --> 01:39:50.066
Apes!

01:39:50.192 --> 01:39:51.567
You did this.

01:39:51.694 --> 01:39:54.320
Your fault. Forest die.

01:39:54.697 --> 01:39:58.700
Is this how you thank those
who fought for your forest?

01:39:58.826 --> 01:40:00.868
You bring monsters.

01:40:01.036 --> 01:40:03.830
Not animal! Not human!

01:40:04.331 --> 01:40:06.541
Neither animal nor human?

01:40:12.923 --> 01:40:15.425
- They're here!
- Doom! Doom!

01:40:34.778 --> 01:40:35.945
Scouts?

01:40:39.158 --> 01:40:40.950
They're here!

01:40:42.244 --> 01:40:47.582
My warriors have returned
from the land of the dead.

01:40:52.129 --> 01:40:56.966
Forward, my warriors!
To the Deer God!

01:41:03.515 --> 01:41:06.768
Okkoto, no! Your warriors
haven't come back to life.

01:41:12.775 --> 01:41:15.276
The boar skins
hide their scent.

01:41:15.527 --> 01:41:16.611
Humans!

01:41:19.531 --> 01:41:23.159
Stop! They want us to
lead them to the Deer God!

01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:29.624
Come out, Deer God!

01:41:29.792 --> 01:41:35.797
If you are lord of this forest,
revive my warriors to slay the humans.

01:41:37.508 --> 01:41:39.801
Okkoto! Still your heart!

01:41:40.469 --> 01:41:43.638
We're surrounded! He's done for.
Leave him!

01:41:43.889 --> 01:41:46.808
No! He'll become a demon!

01:41:47.434 --> 01:41:51.145
Tell Mother it's the Deer God
the humans want.

01:41:51.647 --> 01:41:53.731
She'll know what to do.

01:41:55.943 --> 01:41:58.361
We can't let our kind die out!

01:41:59.655 --> 01:42:00.571
Go!

01:42:20.092 --> 01:42:25.096
I'll kill the first one who moves,
and tell the forest what you are.

01:42:36.150 --> 01:42:37.483
Ashitaka?

01:42:44.199 --> 01:42:45.241
Get back!

01:42:52.082 --> 01:42:56.210
I burn! A flame bursts from within me.

01:42:57.462 --> 01:42:58.880
No!

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:02.717
No, Okkoto! Don't turn into a demon!

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:06.053
Okkoto!

01:43:09.474 --> 01:43:10.600
An answer!

01:43:13.854 --> 01:43:15.730
- What is it?
- San's in danger!

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:16.772
Let's go!

01:43:45.177 --> 01:43:46.510
It's hot!

01:43:55.562 --> 01:43:58.439
No! I don't want
to be a demon!

01:43:58.607 --> 01:44:00.024
Okkoto!

01:44:11.578 --> 01:44:13.037
Too slow. Get on.

01:44:27.302 --> 01:44:28.427
A wolf!

01:44:31.765 --> 01:44:32.640
Eboshi...

01:44:39.398 --> 01:44:40.982
Go on ahead!

01:44:42.484 --> 01:44:44.527
Eboshi, listen to me!

01:44:44.903 --> 01:44:47.280
- Cease fire!
- Ashitaka?

01:44:47.864 --> 01:44:52.785
The ironworks are under attack.
Forget the Deer God and go back!

01:44:53.036 --> 01:44:54.578
The women need help.

01:44:55.330 --> 01:44:59.333
Your men are on their way.
They're waiting for you.

01:44:59.751 --> 01:45:01.836
What proof do you have?

01:45:02.045 --> 01:45:05.673
None! I would have stayed
and fought if I could!

01:45:06.341 --> 01:45:09.969
You want me to kill samurai
instead of the Deer God?

01:45:10.178 --> 01:45:14.307
No! Can't the forest
and the ironworks live in peace?

01:45:16.852 --> 01:45:20.062
- Whose side is he on?
- Let's go back!

01:45:20.689 --> 01:45:25.568
The women can hold their own.
They have weapons and supplies.

01:45:28.238 --> 01:45:30.740
There's the pond. He's close!

01:45:32.242 --> 01:45:34.702
It's now or never. Stay alert.

01:45:35.495 --> 01:45:37.163
Do we need her?

01:45:37.372 --> 01:45:40.624
We're hunting a god.
Let her do the dirty work.

01:46:07.611 --> 01:46:09.195
Moro! Are you dead?

01:46:09.488 --> 01:46:10.696
San!

01:46:10.822 --> 01:46:12.490
Where are you?

01:46:13.158 --> 01:46:14.658
San!

01:46:22.125 --> 01:46:23.417
Ashitaka!

01:46:30.926 --> 01:46:32.009
Okkoto...

01:46:40.268 --> 01:46:41.727
Leave, boy.

01:46:42.479 --> 01:46:45.147
If we fight, the god won't come.

01:46:49.611 --> 01:46:52.446
Okkoto! Be still!

01:46:56.451 --> 01:47:00.621
Give me Princess Mononoke.
Where is San?

01:47:01.206 --> 01:47:04.500
San, can you hear me?
It's me, Ashitaka!

01:47:10.549 --> 01:47:11.424
San!

01:47:19.182 --> 01:47:20.516
Silence him!

01:47:25.355 --> 01:47:27.273
Shoot him down!

01:47:51.506 --> 01:47:56.218
San!

01:47:59.181 --> 01:48:00.014
Ashitaka!

01:48:04.978 --> 01:48:05.769
San!

01:48:06.438 --> 01:48:07.605
Ashitaka!

01:48:15.238 --> 01:48:21.744
And here I was saving my last
strength for that woman.

01:48:21.995 --> 01:48:23.454
Close up!

01:48:41.223 --> 01:48:43.641
Stay away from him.

01:48:43.767 --> 01:48:45.809
The curse will fall on you.

01:48:54.069 --> 01:48:57.071
Have you lost even the power of speech?

01:48:57.989 --> 01:49:02.409
Well done. Fall back
and tend to the wounded.

01:49:03.995 --> 01:49:06.247
A horrible sight.

01:49:15.215 --> 01:49:16.090
There he is.

01:49:28.603 --> 01:49:30.646
Give me back my daughter!

01:49:53.128 --> 01:49:54.169
Ashitaka...

01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:56.880
Can you save San?

01:50:06.516 --> 01:50:08.017
The Deer God...

01:50:19.154 --> 01:50:20.738
Don't shoot!

01:50:34.419 --> 01:50:38.255
Eboshi! Your enemy is not
the Deer God!

01:50:39.215 --> 01:50:40.466
Guns can't hurt him...

01:50:40.592 --> 01:50:42.134
Only through the head...

01:50:52.103 --> 01:50:52.978
San!

01:51:02.906 --> 01:51:04.031
Don't die!

01:51:31.559 --> 01:51:34.561
They wanted life,
but it gave them death.

01:51:54.666 --> 01:51:58.460
- It's the Nightwalker!
- Watch closely, all of you.

01:51:58.878 --> 01:52:00.921
This is how you kill a god.

01:52:01.339 --> 01:52:03.924
This is also the god of death.

01:52:04.259 --> 01:52:06.135
Stay close behind me.

01:52:23.069 --> 01:52:24.278
Stop!

01:52:27.657 --> 01:52:28.741
Eboshi!

01:52:40.587 --> 01:52:43.130
Damn you!

01:52:53.391 --> 01:52:55.934
Got him! Get the head!

01:53:34.974 --> 01:53:37.351
Jiko! Bring the box!

01:53:38.353 --> 01:53:41.146
The porters are dead! Quick!

01:53:42.941 --> 01:53:46.735
Don't touch the body!
It'll suck the life out of you.

01:53:50.532 --> 01:53:52.950
Take it! The head is yours.

01:54:01.376 --> 01:54:02.584
Lady Eboshi!

01:54:03.002 --> 01:54:05.712
Moro's head... it moved by itself!

01:54:05.964 --> 01:54:09.716
Come on, hurry! Run!

01:54:14.097 --> 01:54:15.764
Run!

01:54:32.490 --> 01:54:33.740
To the island!

01:54:33.908 --> 01:54:36.618
- I can't swim!
- It's shallow.

01:55:05.148 --> 01:55:07.149
Bring her here. I'll kill her!

01:55:07.358 --> 01:55:10.777
Moro's had her revenge.

01:55:11.112 --> 01:55:13.155
- Lady Eboshi!
- Help me.

01:55:17.285 --> 01:55:19.620
Don't waste your sympathy.

01:55:19.954 --> 01:55:22.414
I promised Toki I'd bring you back.

01:55:28.796 --> 01:55:31.256
It's searching for its head.
We can't stay here.

01:55:31.633 --> 01:55:32.424
San!

01:55:33.176 --> 01:55:34.217
Help me.

01:55:34.344 --> 01:55:36.970
No! You're on their side!

01:55:37.138 --> 01:55:39.222
Take her and go away!

01:55:42.143 --> 01:55:44.436
Keep away! I hate humans!

01:55:45.396 --> 01:55:48.815
I am human. So are you.

01:55:48.942 --> 01:55:49.691
Shut up!

01:55:49.943 --> 01:55:51.610
I'm a wolf!

01:55:53.196 --> 01:55:54.363
Don't touch me!

01:56:00.328 --> 01:56:03.580
I'm sorry. I tried to stop it.

01:56:10.755 --> 01:56:14.633
Everything is finished.
The forest is dead.

01:56:24.268 --> 01:56:28.855
No it's not.
We're still alive. Help me.

01:56:54.549 --> 01:56:56.466
Wait! Help us!

01:56:56.676 --> 01:56:59.553
A little danger and they're useless.

01:57:02.765 --> 01:57:04.224
Don't stop!

01:57:10.064 --> 01:57:11.398
The head's moving!

01:57:14.902 --> 01:57:16.611
It's calling him!

01:58:00.073 --> 01:58:01.031
That will fix it.

01:58:01.157 --> 01:58:02.115
Thanks.

01:58:02.825 --> 01:58:06.119
- It's too quiet.
- They're waiting for dawn.

01:58:07.163 --> 01:58:10.290
I wonder if that young man
found Eboshi.

01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:15.295
I'm sure he did.
She should be here soon.

01:58:17.799 --> 01:58:21.760
Look at that face. Hey, Koroku!

01:58:21.969 --> 01:58:24.721
Let him sleep for now.

01:58:35.024 --> 01:58:37.484
What is it? It sounds unearthly.

01:58:50.331 --> 01:58:51.581
The Nightwalker!

01:59:05.555 --> 01:59:07.305
Hold your positions!

01:59:08.391 --> 01:59:11.309
- It's coming this way.
- We've got to run.

01:59:11.853 --> 01:59:15.230
We guard the ironworks!
We promised Lady Eboshi.

01:59:21.904 --> 01:59:23.905
It's him! Ashitaka!

01:59:29.203 --> 01:59:30.287
Everyone, escape!

01:59:30.872 --> 01:59:33.915
The Deer God
is coming for his head!

01:59:34.292 --> 01:59:36.668
Touch that muck and you're dead!

01:59:37.044 --> 01:59:39.921
Go to the lake.
The water will protect you.

01:59:40.464 --> 01:59:43.717
Lady Eboshi and the men
are coming from the other side.

01:59:44.135 --> 01:59:47.053
We must return the head!

01:59:47.305 --> 01:59:48.180
Hurry!

01:59:48.806 --> 01:59:50.056
It's here.

01:59:50.641 --> 01:59:52.058
What do we do?

01:59:52.226 --> 01:59:53.643
Don't panic.

01:59:53.769 --> 01:59:55.228
To the lake!

01:59:55.521 --> 01:59:58.231
Stay calm! Help the injured.

02:00:07.867 --> 02:00:09.534
Not that way!

02:00:26.010 --> 02:00:28.094
There goes the roof...

02:00:33.601 --> 02:00:37.437
Once the forge starts to burn,
it's all over.

02:00:38.022 --> 02:00:41.733
No, it isn't. We're still alive.
Farther... quickly!

02:00:59.710 --> 02:01:01.002
There they are!

02:01:13.391 --> 02:01:14.266
Go!

02:01:15.393 --> 02:01:16.685
Wait!

02:01:17.436 --> 02:01:20.855
You're still alive? That's good.

02:01:21.482 --> 02:01:24.359
I'll return the head.
Leave it and go.

02:01:24.819 --> 02:01:29.155
Give it back now? It's too late.
The sun's coming up.

02:01:29.323 --> 02:01:33.034
Look! A brainless,
life-sucking god of death.

02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:34.869
He'll vanish with the sun.

02:01:35.121 --> 02:01:37.122
He's coming, Jiko. Quick!

02:01:37.248 --> 02:01:42.252
The thirst to possess heaven and earth
is what makes us human.

02:01:42.545 --> 02:01:44.087
I don't want to kill you.

02:01:45.339 --> 02:01:46.589
Oh, dear.

02:01:47.008 --> 02:01:48.842
Don't look so serious.

02:01:55.683 --> 02:01:56.850
Get going!

02:02:16.537 --> 02:02:17.704
Ashitaka!

02:02:25.713 --> 02:02:26.921
Trapped.

02:02:29.550 --> 02:02:30.884
We're surrounded!

02:02:32.136 --> 02:02:34.804
- Sun, come quickly!
- Open it!

02:02:34.930 --> 02:02:37.140
Don't you understand? It's too late.

02:02:37.558 --> 02:02:39.726
Ashitaka, talking with humans
is useless.

02:02:40.269 --> 02:02:41.978
Human hands must return it.

02:02:44.023 --> 02:02:45.732
I warned you.

02:03:00.748 --> 02:03:02.415
O Deer God...

02:03:02.666 --> 02:03:04.417
We return your head!

02:03:04.919 --> 02:03:06.753
Be at peace!

02:03:17.765 --> 02:03:19.933
Here it comes!

02:03:50.923 --> 02:03:53.341
- It stopped.
- There they are!

02:04:06.647 --> 02:04:07.897
Lady Eboshi!

02:04:08.232 --> 02:04:10.150
Careful, she's hurt.

02:04:38.345 --> 02:04:40.472
It's falling!

02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:48.480
Hang on tight!

02:05:55.422 --> 02:05:59.342
I didn't know the Deer God
made flowers bloom.

02:06:30.457 --> 02:06:32.250
San, look!

02:07:02.865 --> 02:07:06.117
Even restored, these are not
the Deer God's woods.

02:07:06.702 --> 02:07:08.745
The Deer God is dead.

02:07:09.246 --> 02:07:12.582
He can't die.
He is life itself.

02:07:12.750 --> 02:07:15.001
He is both life and death.

02:07:15.919 --> 02:07:17.754
He is telling us we should live.

02:07:26.305 --> 02:07:29.891
I love you, Ashitaka.
But I'll never forgive the human race.

02:07:30.309 --> 02:07:34.228
Then live in the forest,
and I'll live at the ironworks.

02:07:34.855 --> 02:07:36.230
Together, we'll live.

02:07:36.815 --> 02:07:39.192
Yakul and I will visit you.

02:07:51.205 --> 02:07:55.541
Can you believe it?
Carried to safety by a wolf.

02:07:56.377 --> 02:07:59.671
Someone bring Ashitaka.
I want to thank him.

02:08:00.381 --> 02:08:04.425
We'll start over.
We'll build a good village here.

02:08:05.135 --> 02:08:08.971
I give up.
You can't win against fools.
