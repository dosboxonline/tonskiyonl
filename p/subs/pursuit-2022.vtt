Thank you, Frank.

15:00.812 --> 15:03.380
[Frank] You let me know
when you have time
to talk with Rick.

15:03.424 --> 15:04.991
He should know the truth
about his wife.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.340
[Jack] Yeah, I'll
have a talk with him.

15:06.383 --> 15:09.212
He's still grieving.
Hardly been two weeks.

move on, Jack.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.485
I was surprised
to see Frank.

16:04.528 --> 16:05.965

a raid this morning.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.923

16:23.591 --> 16:26.463
He's making moves
and we had an arrangement.

16:26.507 --> 16:30.946
Well, we can't have people
running around unsupervised.

16:30.990 --> 16:34.471
- All right, I'll
make some calls.
- Yeah.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.299
Send another message.

16:36.343 --> 16:38.693
Jack, I'm sorry
to interrupt.
It's about Rick.

Suggested
a bereavement leave.

16:58.278 --> 16:59.714
And what did you say?

17:01.150 --> 17:03.065
I can't afford
to lose a good cop.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.067
You're saying
I'm a good cop?

17:05.111 --> 17:06.547
You're a work

This is bullshit!

17:46.717 --> 17:48.893
[Breslin] Who is he?

17:50.852 --> 17:52.723
Why the fuck
you asking me for?

17:52.767 --> 17:54.682
Don't you have
computers and shit?

17:54.725 --> 17:56.379
Facial recognition?

17:56.423 --> 17:58.381
Oh, it seems
this man's a ghost.

17:58.425 --> 18:00.383
No fingerprints,
no records.

18:00.427 --> 18:02.429
Those computers
you're talking about
have found nothing.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.085
Sal, when you go missing,

18:06.128 --> 18:07.738
in Cuba is there anyone
that will even care?

18:10.089 --> 18:11.742
Okay, caballito.

18:11.786 --> 18:13.614
But I have to ask
you something.

18:15.137 --> 18:17.139
Were those front row
tickets real?

18:17.183 --> 18:19.185
Best seats in the house.

18:25.016 --> 18:27.280
This is Rick Calloway.

18:29.412 --> 18:32.720
He's a hacker.
One of the best.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.028
That's the reason
he doesn't exist.

18:38.334 --> 18:42.338
He would be a very big deal
for you guys to catch.

18:45.211 --> 18:49.606
Young kid like you,
looking to make his mark?

18:51.347 --> 18:55.351
He knows many,
many things.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.311
All the way to the top.

18:59.312 --> 19:00.661
Where is he?

19:00.704 --> 19:01.923
I don't know.

19:05.361 --> 19:07.363
No one really knows.

19:14.283 --> 19:15.545
We cut a deal...

19:17.678 --> 19:20.115

[Shannon] So I just
took the test and...

21:27.416 --> 21:28.809
[Breslin] We've got some news.

21:28.852 --> 21:30.724
- You tell 'em.
- On three. One, two, three.

21:30.767 --> 21:32.291
- [both] We're pregnant!
- [Breslin laughs]

21:32.334 --> 21:34.031
Okay, I'm glad
you saidwe and not just me.

21:34.075 --> 21:35.859
Is it weird when you say
we're pregnant?

21:35.903 --> 21:38.340
- It's ours.
- 'Cause I'm the one
who's pregnant.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.037
[Breslin] We gotta
think of names ASAP.

21:40.081 --> 21:42.562
[Shannon and Mike
continue chattering]

21:44.564 --> 21:47.218
I'm so excited.
You're gonna be a dad.

21:47.262 --> 21:49.264
[Breslin] It's gonna
be a boy, right?

21:49.308 --> 21:51.048
I don't know.
I'm wearing pink,

21:51.092 --> 21:53.877
- so maybe it's a sign.
- It is a sign.

[Troy] Grandpa,
where's my dad?

23:46.642 --> 23:48.209
[Jack] He's gonna be
here soon, I promise.

23:48.252 --> 23:49.776
Now make a wish
and blow out the candles.

23:51.995 --> 23:54.563
Make a wish.
Take a deep breath,

24:11.362 --> 24:12.494
[Sal] I saw his face.

24:12.538 --> 24:15.192
The guy is fucking nuts, okay?

24:15.236 --> 24:17.630
He killed my guys, and then
came asking about Rachel

24:17.673 --> 24:19.501
with a gun to my head.

24:19.545 --> 24:21.068
What the fuck, man?

24:21.111 --> 24:22.678
I did what you asked.

24:22.722 --> 24:25.507
You said, "He knew
what was going on."

24:25.551 --> 24:26.813
[Travis] What did you
tell the police, Sal?

24:26.856 --> 24:29.380
Nothing, I didn't
tell them nothing,

24:29.424 --> 24:32.035
'cause they had-- they saw
video of Rick shooting at me.

24:32.079 --> 24:33.080
He's careless.

24:34.081 --> 24:35.778
What the fuck, man?

24:35.822 --> 24:38.694
I made bail and I expect
your help out of here.

24:38.738 --> 24:39.782
I have to go.

24:39.826 --> 24:41.567
I have to go to Mexico
or Colombia.

24:41.610 --> 24:42.872
You owe me!

Of course he does.
Fucking mess.

24:58.061 --> 24:59.149
All right.

25:00.411 --> 25:02.196
I'll call Frank,
and, uh...

25:04.241 --> 25:05.634
you go get him
and bring him home.

25:32.269 --> 25:34.271
Just left your house.

25:34.315 --> 25:36.535
I am not too happy.

25:36.578 --> 25:39.189
I just heard your son's
been shooting up our boys.

25:39.233 --> 25:40.843
Thought you had
a handle on that.

25:40.887 --> 25:43.019
He's my son,
I'll take care of this.

25:43.063 --> 25:45.544
Yeah, well,
you better, Jack.

25:45.587 --> 25:48.547

it could get real messy.

25:57.947 --> 26:00.950
[upbeat dance music playing]

26:02.604 --> 26:05.389
Oh, I love these freaky
drug bitches.

26:05.433 --> 26:07.435
What's up?
You wanna come to my club?

26:08.915 --> 26:09.959
Come on, get in there.

26:10.003 --> 26:11.134
Come here.

26:12.745 --> 26:14.311
You looking
for a little bit
of Molly?

26:14.355 --> 26:15.878
- Maybe.
- A little bit of Tina?

26:15.922 --> 26:18.054
- Maybe.
- I got a table,
VIP section.

26:18.098 --> 26:19.839
Tell them
Manos de Rosas sent you.

26:21.536 --> 26:23.582
Bunch of little
nasty bitches.

26:23.625 --> 26:24.844
[speaking Spanish]

26:24.887 --> 26:26.933
[dealer speaking Spanish]

26:26.976 --> 26:28.543
No, no, no. [speaking Spanish]

26:28.587 --> 26:29.892
Don't bullshit me, come on.

26:29.936 --> 26:31.111
- [dealer in Spanish]
- No.

26:34.288 --> 26:35.376
[computer whirring]

26:40.903 --> 26:41.904
[sighs]

26:51.044 --> 26:53.437
- [upbeat music playing]
- [brakes squealing]

26:53.481 --> 26:54.482
Hey!

26:56.310 --> 26:58.355
You wanna move this little
bullshit out the way, please?

26:58.399 --> 26:59.443
Hey, would you--

26:59.487 --> 27:01.228
Oh, shit, it's a bitch.
What's up?

27:01.271 --> 27:03.099
- Oh, hey, baby.
How you doing?
- What's up?

27:03.143 --> 27:04.666
Your titty game
is all right.

27:04.710 --> 27:07.190
Uh, your daddy can't come in,
though. We got enough men.

27:07.234 --> 27:08.670
- Oh, that's fine.
- [groaning] Fuck!

27:10.498 --> 27:12.065
[groans]

27:12.108 --> 27:13.022
What the fuck?

27:20.160 --> 27:21.596
Everyone move in!

27:25.165 --> 27:26.906
- [grunting]
- [people screaming]

27:26.949 --> 27:28.516
[groans]

27:32.520 --> 27:33.652
Get the fuck out of here.

27:35.523 --> 27:37.133
Where's my wife?

27:37.177 --> 27:39.440
[laughs] I ain't telling you
a fucking thing.

27:41.790 --> 27:44.793
Okay, okay, look.
Hey, look. All right, okay.

27:44.837 --> 27:46.186
I was moving her,
all right?

27:47.578 --> 27:49.015
I put her on a truck
to fucking Little Rock.

27:49.058 --> 27:50.320
Some dude named
Diego wanted her.

27:51.626 --> 27:54.629
Frank or John?

27:54.673 --> 27:56.109
Come on, man. I told
you everything I know.

27:56.152 --> 27:57.371
[police sirens approaching]

27:57.414 --> 27:59.068
It's your last chance.

27:59.112 --> 28:00.679
Diego, Diego!

28:07.250 --> 28:09.470
Fuck, fuck.

28:15.041 --> 28:16.869
Hello,
Detective Breslin.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.871
Put the gun down, Rick.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.396
Am I under arrest?

28:22.439 --> 28:23.789
[gunshot echoes]

28:37.280 --> 28:38.194
[door opens]

28:48.074 --> 28:49.989
I asked you to come alone.

28:50.032 --> 28:51.991
Yeah, why am I here?

28:53.035 --> 28:54.733
I mean, you have, uh--

28:54.776 --> 28:55.951
what is it, D?

28:56.952 --> 28:58.040
Three lawyers.

28:59.302 --> 29:00.782
And they all say,
you're not talking, so...

29:00.826 --> 29:03.219
Yeah, lawyers.

29:03.263 --> 29:06.266
Um, well, uh...

29:11.097 --> 29:15.928
I know who murdered
Shannon, your wife.

29:18.278 --> 29:19.801
Tell me their names.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.716
We make a deal.

29:24.023 --> 29:29.158
I'm being transferred
to Arkansas,

29:29.202 --> 29:33.249
and a very powerful man
has put a half million
dollar hit on my head.

29:33.293 --> 29:35.469
Yeah, I really don't
feel sorry for you.

29:37.123 --> 29:39.038
He's a cheap bastard.

29:39.081 --> 29:43.825
My-my point is, keep me
alive during the transfer,

29:43.869 --> 29:47.176
and I will not only
give you the-the keys

29:47.220 --> 29:50.440
to said
"powerful man's" empire,

29:50.484 --> 29:53.835
but, more importantly,
I will--

29:53.879 --> 29:59.536
I will give you the names
of those who murdered your wife.

30:03.976 --> 30:06.282
Three men...

30:06.326 --> 30:10.634
and one woman
threw her over a balcony.

30:10.678 --> 30:11.722
I'm sorry.

30:11.766 --> 30:14.943
She-she was pregnant.

30:14.987 --> 30:16.684
She was gonna have a boy.

30:16.727 --> 30:19.382
- You're a sick fuck.
- I'm sorry.

30:21.123 --> 30:21.950
Mike.

30:21.994 --> 30:23.517
- I'm sorry.
- Mike.

30:24.735 --> 30:25.562
[door slams]

30:27.434 --> 30:29.044
[Jack] All right,
burn it in here, man.

30:32.482 --> 30:34.310
That was a good--
that was a good one.

30:34.354 --> 30:35.268
Good fast ball.

30:35.311 --> 30:36.443
Maybe I could
be a pitcher.

30:36.486 --> 30:37.705
Why not?

30:38.706 --> 30:40.882
Jack, he's here.

30:40.926 --> 30:42.797
How about-how about a--
a second baseman?

30:42.841 --> 30:43.885
Get in front of the ball.

30:46.192 --> 30:48.020
That's a good play.
Here.

30:48.063 --> 30:50.152
- Thank you.
- Play with Lily for a while?

30:51.719 --> 30:52.807
He's getting good.

31:01.033 --> 31:02.034
John.

31:04.863 --> 31:05.907
Disappointed to see me?

31:05.951 --> 31:08.431
No, not at all.

31:08.475 --> 31:09.868
I'm always delighted
to see you.

31:09.911 --> 31:12.218
You look like you
could use a drink.

31:12.261 --> 31:13.610
- Would you like one?
- Please.

31:15.264 --> 31:16.744
Let me get one for you.

31:28.974 --> 31:29.931
How's your grandmother?

31:29.975 --> 31:32.238
Oh, uh, she's, um...

31:33.239 --> 31:34.849
about as well
as she can be.

31:35.981 --> 31:37.199
She's a kind a woman.

31:37.243 --> 31:39.636
Hmm. She's keeping
her sense of humor.

31:39.680 --> 31:40.724
- Is she?
- Yeah.

31:40.768 --> 31:42.465
Good.

31:42.509 --> 31:44.511
It's good
to see you, kid. Salud.

31:45.991 --> 31:46.861
[glasses clink]

31:50.256 --> 31:51.866
- [John exhales]
- What's on your mind?

31:56.305 --> 31:57.219
Um...

32:00.919 --> 32:03.834
Three more drop houses
in New York were raided
this morning.

32:03.878 --> 32:06.054
Yeah, I know.

32:06.098 --> 32:08.709
Frank believes
Rick is talking.

32:08.752 --> 32:10.102
I got the best lawyers
in New York

32:10.145 --> 32:12.060
- who assure me he is not.
- Yeah.

32:12.104 --> 32:13.975
There's a lot of product
that was seized, Jack.

32:14.019 --> 32:17.326
It's not-- it's not
like a small deal.

32:17.370 --> 32:18.762
- It's--
- Hey.

32:18.806 --> 32:20.677
- It's, uh--
- I'm well aware
of the problem.

32:22.592 --> 32:23.680
Come on, spit it out.

32:25.682 --> 32:27.293
I know it was Rick.

32:27.336 --> 32:29.382
- You personally know?
- Yes.

32:31.036 --> 32:33.342
- Rick has been sending--
- Hey, hey, hey,
hold on a minute.

32:33.386 --> 32:34.778
How do you know?

32:34.822 --> 32:41.089
Rick has been sending
information to my father.

32:43.135 --> 32:44.179
What kind of information?

32:44.223 --> 32:46.616
Personal information,
Jack,

32:46.660 --> 32:48.879
that my father has
no business knowing.

32:48.923 --> 32:51.143
Hmm. I understand.

32:53.797 --> 32:55.886
Okay, so it's Rick's...

32:55.930 --> 33:00.239
sending Frank pictures
of you and your boyfriend.

33:00.282 --> 33:03.807
I mean, that's a violation
of your personal sovereignty,

33:03.851 --> 33:06.680
but how the fuck
does that mean
he's talking to the Feds?

33:09.857 --> 33:11.685
Because I value
our friendship,

33:11.728 --> 33:13.774
- it's important
that I come here...
- Hold that thought.

33:13.817 --> 33:16.211
- ...to tell you your face--
I have to.
- Hold that thought.

33:16.255 --> 33:18.126
I'll get you a refill.
That was the cheap stuff.

33:20.172 --> 33:23.044
We can get
the good stuff here, okay?

33:24.219 --> 33:25.612
Now...

33:28.832 --> 33:30.443
What would be in it
for him?

33:32.706 --> 33:33.794
I don't know.

33:35.535 --> 33:37.189
I don't know,
but it's done.

34:07.393 --> 34:08.611
[chair squeaks]

34:19.448 --> 34:21.668
[airplane engine roaring]

34:53.613 --> 34:55.267
Detective Carter.

34:55.310 --> 34:56.529
Our transport's this way.

34:56.572 --> 35:01.099
I, um, I need to use
the-the restroom.

35:01.142 --> 35:04.058
You got one minute,
little guy. Be quick.

35:15.287 --> 35:16.636
First time in Little Rock?

35:16.679 --> 35:18.290
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

35:18.333 --> 35:19.508
[Breslin groans]

35:22.642 --> 35:24.122
- [alarm ringing]
- [groaning]

35:31.172 --> 35:32.130
[grunting]

35:34.741 --> 35:35.655
[groaning]

35:52.628 --> 35:53.803
[groaning]

35:58.068 --> 35:58.982
[groans]

36:00.506 --> 36:01.333
[grunting]

36:06.251 --> 36:07.904
[DeSimone groaning]

36:17.044 --> 36:17.958
[Travis groans]

36:28.664 --> 36:30.100
[alarm wailing]

36:36.890 --> 36:38.500
- Are you okay?
- [Breslin groaning]

36:38.544 --> 36:39.893
[coughing]

36:58.303 --> 36:59.217
[Carter] Breslin.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.522
This way.

37:10.358 --> 37:11.620
[alarm continues wailing]

37:27.245 --> 37:28.594
[tires screeching]

37:30.683 --> 37:32.119
[car engine revving]

37:35.644 --> 37:38.081
Adam-4, code 8.
Black Sedan
heading north east.

37:42.999 --> 37:44.436
The getaway vehicle
you all reported

37:44.479 --> 37:47.395
was a family of four
scared out of their wits.

37:47.439 --> 37:51.443
All right, look,
Rick Calloway is a bit
of a wanted man around here.

37:51.486 --> 37:54.750
Hell, come tomorrow,
I'll find him strung up
on a bridge somewhere,

37:54.794 --> 37:56.274
and I'll call you
when I do.

37:58.232 --> 37:59.277
Detective...

38:02.367 --> 38:05.370
Go back to New York.
You're done here.

38:07.067 --> 38:08.242
Thank you, Sheriff.

38:11.071 --> 38:11.985
Hey.

38:13.900 --> 38:14.988
Breslin.

38:16.468 --> 38:17.469
A word?

38:18.818 --> 38:21.168
Chief Taye Biggs,
Arkansas State Troopers.

38:21.211 --> 38:22.778
I heard what happened
to your partner.

38:22.822 --> 38:24.432
I assure you we're gonna
do everything we can

38:24.476 --> 38:26.216
to find out what
the hell happened.

38:26.260 --> 38:27.914
I'd like to stick
around to help.

38:27.957 --> 38:30.960
All right. All right,
we can do that.

38:32.875 --> 38:34.747
We already have
some history here
with Carter,

38:34.790 --> 38:38.751
so we're gonna let you act
as liaison with my office.

38:38.794 --> 38:40.100
All right?
In the meantime,

38:40.143 --> 38:42.189
why don't you go
get some shuteye,

38:42.232 --> 38:44.452
and then we can talk?

38:44.496 --> 38:48.369
And just so you know,
this is my jurisdiction.

38:53.505 --> 38:54.419
Huh?

38:55.420 --> 38:56.551
You got it.

38:58.858 --> 39:00.338
[Carter]
Truck's over here.

39:30.411 --> 39:31.717
[Breslin]
You all right?

39:31.760 --> 39:34.197
Yeah, I'm okay.
Thanks.

39:34.241 --> 39:35.198
You?

39:35.242 --> 39:36.678
Just lost
one of my best friends.

39:36.722 --> 39:37.810
I'm not sure how I am.

39:40.073 --> 39:41.161
So you're a sheriff?

39:42.249 --> 39:44.207
Yes, sir.

39:44.251 --> 39:46.122
You look like you just
got out of the academy.

39:46.166 --> 39:48.342
Huh, I was thinking
the same thing about you.

39:48.386 --> 39:51.954
Okay, yeah, all right,
I understand.

39:51.998 --> 39:55.175
I'm actually, uh,
the first person
in my family

39:55.218 --> 39:56.350
to graduate college.

39:57.525 --> 39:58.613
Arkansas State.

40:00.267 --> 40:01.964
Got a degree
in criminal justice,

40:02.008 --> 40:04.184
applied to Lonoke PD,

40:04.227 --> 40:05.446
worked that
for a couple years,

40:05.490 --> 40:06.795
and applied for sheriff.

40:08.754 --> 40:10.625
You wanna know why Biggs
put you to spy on me?

40:13.149 --> 40:14.542
Sure.

40:15.935 --> 40:17.937
Diminished responsibility.

40:18.938 --> 40:20.200
I have another theory.

40:21.375 --> 40:22.594
What's that?

40:23.638 --> 40:27.599
Well, you see, I have this,
like, special ability, right?

40:27.642 --> 40:29.427
I can, um...

40:29.470 --> 40:30.950
I can tolerate assholes.

40:30.993 --> 40:33.039
- Oh.
- So.

40:33.082 --> 40:34.257
Ouch.

40:34.301 --> 40:36.564
Pretty sure that had
something to do with it.

40:36.608 --> 40:38.131
Well, we'll see if
he's right or not.

40:38.174 --> 40:39.785
[laughs] I guess we will.

41:05.506 --> 41:07.203
Uh...

41:07.247 --> 41:11.033
So, when will I
see my, uh, father?

41:11.077 --> 41:12.731
[phone ringing]

41:18.214 --> 41:21.653
[speaking Spanish]

41:25.526 --> 41:27.006
Oh, okay. [chuckles]

41:28.007 --> 41:28.834
Yeah.

41:33.839 --> 41:35.014
- Oh, I don't.
- SÃ­.

41:35.057 --> 41:36.581
Thanks, I don't smoke.

41:36.624 --> 41:40.410
Yeah, you really
shouldn't do that.

41:40.454 --> 41:43.631
The tobacco corporations
are conglomerates

41:43.675 --> 41:45.546
that cause mass death, see?

41:51.596 --> 41:53.336
Yeah, see, I, uh--

41:54.816 --> 41:57.340
I don't smoke tobacco,

41:57.384 --> 42:01.214
but, uh, I do like mota.

42:01.257 --> 42:03.346
- Uh. Okay, yeah.
- I like that. Yeah.

42:06.175 --> 42:07.176
[chuckles]

42:19.928 --> 42:21.974
Wow, you got pretty
good stuff, huh?

42:22.017 --> 42:25.934
I guess that's part
of the cartel perk.

42:25.978 --> 42:28.633
So, uh...

42:29.764 --> 42:31.418
I'm gonna have
a bad high, huh?

42:33.072 --> 42:33.986
Yeah.

42:37.511 --> 42:39.165
I got you.

42:39.208 --> 42:40.601
- [Jack] The whole thing
is a clusterfuck.
- [Troy] That hurt!

42:40.645 --> 42:42.777
- Well, you have
your son involved.
- Uh-huh.

42:42.821 --> 42:44.387
Biggs told NYPD
to stick around.

42:44.431 --> 42:46.433
- Get Dodge over there.
- He is.

42:46.476 --> 42:48.304
[Jack] All right.

42:48.348 --> 42:50.655
- All right, and then
get Frank on the phone.
- I'm on it.

42:50.698 --> 42:52.961
- Come on, Papa, let's play.
- I gotta work for a while.

42:53.005 --> 42:54.136
You go play with Lily, yeah?

42:54.180 --> 42:55.703
When are my parents
coming to get me?

42:55.747 --> 42:56.791
- Lily!
- Hey.

42:57.836 --> 42:58.837
- Come on, baby.
- Frank.

42:58.880 --> 43:00.186
He doesn't wanna
talk to you, Jack.

43:00.229 --> 43:02.710
Tell them nothing moves
until we talk.

43:02.754 --> 43:04.582
- You sure that's smart?
- Yep.

43:09.543 --> 43:11.545
[Connors] They're having
the body flown to Jersey
tomorrow.

43:14.200 --> 43:17.377
The family asked if you
would carry the flag.

43:17.420 --> 43:18.987
I won't be back in time.

43:20.293 --> 43:21.990
You need anything?

43:22.034 --> 43:23.862
Styles and some gear.

43:25.646 --> 43:27.039
Mike, make sure
whoever did this

43:27.082 --> 43:29.084
knows not to fuck
with the NYPD.

43:31.826 --> 43:32.740
[phone beeps]

43:52.630 --> 43:53.543
[grunting]

44:09.690 --> 44:10.604
Morning.

44:12.737 --> 44:13.738
[birds chirping]

44:13.781 --> 44:15.827
Breakfast tacos?

44:15.870 --> 44:17.306
Eggs and tortilla?
Yeah, sure.

44:18.873 --> 44:20.309
Something like that.

44:39.807 --> 44:40.895
[indistinct chatter]

44:42.157 --> 44:43.158
Thank you.

44:46.379 --> 44:47.467
You said "taco."

44:47.510 --> 44:49.034
Yes, I did.

44:50.426 --> 44:51.689
This is a burrito.

44:53.473 --> 44:55.867
You know, I went
to New York once...

44:57.346 --> 44:58.783
and, um,

44:58.826 --> 45:00.698
when I asked for hot sauce,
they brought me ketchup.

45:02.395 --> 45:03.526
What flavor?

45:04.527 --> 45:05.615
Heinz 57.

45:07.226 --> 45:08.270
Move over.
Move over, man.

45:08.314 --> 45:11.447
- Hey.
- Hey, stop!
Stop it!

45:11.491 --> 45:13.667
What the--
Sit down, sit down.

45:15.190 --> 45:16.104
Sit down.

45:25.810 --> 45:27.768
George, Breslin, NYPD.

45:27.812 --> 45:29.117
[scoffs]

45:29.161 --> 45:30.510
NYPD?

45:30.553 --> 45:32.642
I thought he'd be older,
or bigger, or somethin'.

45:32.686 --> 45:33.818
What up,
little white boy?

45:33.861 --> 45:35.558
You got some cars
to work on or something?

45:35.602 --> 45:37.299
- You got some people
to shoot for no reason?
- Okay.

45:39.214 --> 45:42.435
- George is my CI.
- Hey, I'm no one's anything.

45:42.478 --> 45:45.046
I do what I do
when I do to survive.

45:45.090 --> 45:47.309
The perks
ain't bad neither.

45:47.353 --> 45:48.354
What the fuck is this?

45:49.790 --> 45:51.966
[Carter] What can you tell us
about Rick Calloway?

45:52.010 --> 45:54.752
- Shit, I don't know nothing.
- George, I'm not playing.

45:56.710 --> 45:57.842
Come on.

46:01.454 --> 46:04.631
Frank Diego made a hit
on him for about 500 grand.

46:04.674 --> 46:08.113
Word is, crews are lined up
all down the highway
to take the fool down,

46:08.156 --> 46:09.984
but somebody
got to him first.

46:10.028 --> 46:11.899
- Who?
- Fuck if I know.

46:11.943 --> 46:13.988
But everybody's still looking,
because the hit's still open

46:14.032 --> 46:15.555
and the price has been upped.

46:15.598 --> 46:16.686
How much?

46:18.471 --> 46:20.168
One million dollars.

46:21.604 --> 46:22.780
On one hit.

46:24.346 --> 46:26.000
Let's pay his father
a visit.

46:27.436 --> 46:29.612
- Jack Calloway?
- Yep.

46:29.656 --> 46:31.179
No, we'd need Biggs
to approve that.

46:31.223 --> 46:32.877
If Rick's not dead,
Jack has him.

46:32.920 --> 46:34.704
[laughs] Oh, shit!

46:34.748 --> 46:36.663
Little white boy talk
like he knows something, huh?

46:38.317 --> 46:40.841
Listen, Frank Diego
make a hit,

46:40.885 --> 46:43.452
even Jesus Christ
himself can't stop it.

46:43.496 --> 46:46.804
Nah, brah, Pops sitting
home with his mouth shut,

46:46.847 --> 46:48.806
waiting to identify
the body.

46:48.849 --> 46:50.720
Now you shut
your goofy ass up.

46:50.764 --> 46:53.767
Don't come by here no more.
You're gonna get me fucked up.

47:04.430 --> 47:07.389
[Jack] Is that Simon,
your favorite right there?

47:07.433 --> 47:09.827
Hey, don't-don't
use too much food.

47:09.870 --> 47:11.393
Why not?

47:11.437 --> 47:13.787
'Cause some creatures don't
know when to stop eating.

47:13.831 --> 47:15.702
Do their bellies explode?

47:18.705 --> 47:20.446
Jack, it's Frank.

47:21.795 --> 47:23.579
Frank, Frank, Frank.

47:23.623 --> 47:25.407
We lost another
location this morning.

47:25.451 --> 47:26.800
That's five this week.

47:26.844 --> 47:29.585
I know, I know, I heard.
It's not Rick.

47:30.935 --> 47:33.415
Where's your son, Jack?
Who has him?

47:33.459 --> 47:35.069
You tell me.

47:35.113 --> 47:36.854
I mean, with a fucking half
a million dollar price
on his head,

47:36.897 --> 47:38.507
what the fuck did you expect
was gonna happen?

47:38.551 --> 47:39.769
He's gonna run.

47:39.813 --> 47:41.989
I'd expect somebody
to collect that money.

47:42.033 --> 47:44.949
Now I'll bring him in, Frank,
and it's not Rick.

47:44.992 --> 47:47.255
Let me handle my son,
please.

47:47.299 --> 47:49.301
Nah, it's too late
for that, Jack.

47:51.042 --> 47:52.130
Frank...

47:53.348 --> 47:55.394
I'm asking you
as a friend, please.

47:55.437 --> 47:56.612
[phone beeping]

48:27.078 --> 48:29.167
Hello, son.
Sit down.

48:30.298 --> 48:31.386
Have a seat.

48:32.518 --> 48:33.432
Manuel.

48:36.870 --> 48:37.871
Dig in.

48:56.020 --> 48:57.195
So...

49:00.067 --> 49:01.677
where's Rick?

49:05.507 --> 49:08.032
Uh, I don't know.

49:12.819 --> 49:14.473
No, no, no, hey!
What are you doing?

49:14.516 --> 49:15.387
Dad?

49:15.430 --> 49:17.171
Don't bullshit me, boy.

49:18.172 --> 49:20.696
Dad, stop!

49:20.740 --> 49:22.872
I don't care who
you're fucking, boy,

49:22.916 --> 49:24.918
as long as it's not me.

49:27.486 --> 49:30.184
Now get up and go find Rick.

49:36.625 --> 49:38.018
You go after him.

49:38.062 --> 49:40.020
Make sure he does what I say.

49:50.900 --> 49:51.989
[doorbell ringing]

49:53.077 --> 49:55.383
- [Travis] Sorry, he's busy.
- [Biggs] Just a short visit,
Paul.

49:55.427 --> 49:57.124
- For my sake.
- Come back with a warrant.

49:57.168 --> 49:58.778
[Jack] All right,
I'm not that busy.

50:00.562 --> 50:02.695
- Hello, Biggs.
- Hey, Jack.

50:02.738 --> 50:05.176
Listen, when your son
was taken,

50:05.219 --> 50:07.830
one of NYPD was killed,
and they just--

50:07.874 --> 50:11.312
they got a couple
of questions for you.

50:13.184 --> 50:14.837
Okay.

50:14.881 --> 50:16.709
Mr. Calloway,
I'm Detective Mike Breslin,

50:16.752 --> 50:18.711
and, uh, we're looking
for your son Rick.

50:18.754 --> 50:20.408
Yeah, well,
I haven't seen him,

50:20.452 --> 50:23.759
uh, and he has been
home for years.

50:23.803 --> 50:25.848
Oh.

50:25.892 --> 50:27.894
Well, you know, if my son
came to town with a hit
on his head,

50:27.937 --> 50:29.374
I would wanna make
sure that he was safe.

50:30.940 --> 50:33.639
Well, we had a falling out
many years ago
and we don't talk.

50:35.858 --> 50:37.599
What about his wife?
Where is she?

50:38.731 --> 50:40.472
She left him, um...

50:40.515 --> 50:43.083
so if you find her,
let us know.

50:43.127 --> 50:44.954
[Breslin] So she's missing?

50:44.998 --> 50:46.173
[Jack] No, we care about her.

50:46.217 --> 50:48.436
[Breslin] Do you have
her contact info?

50:48.480 --> 50:49.872
No, I don't.

50:49.916 --> 50:51.439
And other than that...

50:52.875 --> 50:55.661
I would say have a great day.

50:57.576 --> 50:59.752
And if you wanna come back,
call the lawyers, yeah?

51:02.885 --> 51:04.235
Thank you, Jack.

51:07.281 --> 51:08.891
Rick's not here.

51:08.935 --> 51:10.328
How do you know?

51:10.371 --> 51:12.199
Oh, just a hunch.

51:12.243 --> 51:14.549
Listen, I got something to do.
I'll see you back
at the station.

51:14.593 --> 51:15.898
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

51:17.770 --> 51:20.425
[Breslin] That's a nice ride.
You know, I had one
back in college.

51:20.468 --> 51:22.383
How old are you again?

51:22.427 --> 51:24.211
[chuckles] It was
a fixer-upper, Carter.

51:24.255 --> 51:25.169
Okay.

51:32.915 --> 51:35.918
Isn't time I start
searching for Rick?
Bring him home?

51:39.444 --> 51:40.358
Jack.

52:07.472 --> 52:09.604
Hey, I just got
the system booted.

52:14.087 --> 52:16.350
Hi. Officer Carter.

52:16.394 --> 52:18.004
She's good, Styles.

52:26.795 --> 52:28.971
[scoffs] Excuse me.

52:29.015 --> 52:31.191
You know, I had to pull off
some serious fucking favors

52:31.235 --> 52:33.759
- to get this shit together.
- [computer beeping]

52:33.802 --> 52:35.064
How the hell
did you get that?

52:36.240 --> 52:38.111
[Styles] Ask Detective Nunya.

52:39.504 --> 52:41.767
And there's Rick Calloway.

52:49.688 --> 52:51.037
Wait, go back a bit.

52:53.082 --> 52:53.996
[computer beeps]

52:56.695 --> 52:57.870
Who is that?

52:59.828 --> 53:01.178
That's Dodge.

53:04.137 --> 53:06.008
Where I can find Dodge
on a Friday night?

53:08.315 --> 53:09.664
Jimmy Doyle's.

53:10.752 --> 53:12.798
I'll pick you up
in an hour, okay?

53:12.841 --> 53:15.235
- Sure.
- Oh, and, uh, Breslin,

53:15.279 --> 53:18.195
make sure you have
your dancing boots on,
okay?

53:34.820 --> 53:36.517
How long can we track them
after injection?

53:36.561 --> 53:39.477
Two days,
then it dissipates.

53:39.520 --> 53:41.609
Do you even own
cowboy boots?

53:41.653 --> 53:43.089
No, Styles, I do not.

53:47.441 --> 53:48.703
[country music playing]

54:12.205 --> 54:14.425
What do you think?

54:14.468 --> 54:15.730
It's, uh,
quite the place.

54:15.774 --> 54:17.819
[laughs] It's good people.

54:18.907 --> 54:20.648
So how long have you
lived in New York?

54:20.692 --> 54:22.215
Born and raised.

54:22.259 --> 54:23.695
Parents moved there
after Woodstock.

54:24.957 --> 54:27.133
- In '94.
- Okay.

54:27.176 --> 54:29.570
So they must be
the hippy-dippy type?

54:29.614 --> 54:31.703
College professors.

54:31.746 --> 54:33.400
- Really?
- Yeah.

54:34.836 --> 54:37.535
So what led you
to become a cop, then?

54:37.578 --> 54:39.537
Because they hated
the idea of it.

54:39.580 --> 54:42.061
[laughing]

54:42.104 --> 54:44.063
Holidays must be fun.

54:44.106 --> 54:45.586
Oh, it's a good time.

54:45.630 --> 54:47.545
[laughs] Fair enough.

54:48.633 --> 54:50.069
You have
any brothers, sisters?

54:51.418 --> 54:52.680
Lone wolf.

54:56.336 --> 55:00.166
To the lone wolf, always
hunting and never full.

55:00.209 --> 55:02.211
- [glasses clink]
- [cheers and applause]

55:04.779 --> 55:06.999
- [groaning]
- [man yells]

55:07.042 --> 55:10.176
[country music playing]

55:10.219 --> 55:12.700
I love this song.
You wanna dance?

55:14.006 --> 55:15.355
No.

55:15.399 --> 55:17.139
- Breslin, come on.
- No, I'm good, I'll watch.

55:17.183 --> 55:21.535
You can't keep
this tough guy act up
forever. Come on.

55:21.579 --> 55:23.189
Come with me.
Thank you.

55:48.214 --> 55:50.259
Shoulda put
your boots on, sir.

55:52.479 --> 55:54.307
Hey, partner,
mind if I cut in?

55:54.351 --> 55:56.353
Party of dos, Dodge.

55:57.397 --> 55:58.790
What the fuck, Zo?

55:59.791 --> 56:01.575
I'm just trying to exist.

56:01.619 --> 56:03.664
You know, uh,
Zoe around here

56:03.708 --> 56:06.537
has a little bit
of a reputation.

56:06.580 --> 56:08.495
[whispering] Some say that
she likes it in the ass.

56:08.539 --> 56:09.409
[grunts]

56:09.453 --> 56:12.412
[hoedown playing]

56:12.456 --> 56:13.370
[grunts]

56:17.243 --> 56:18.157
[groaning]

56:20.115 --> 56:21.943
[both grunting and groaning]

56:27.993 --> 56:29.647
[groans]

56:29.690 --> 56:31.692
[song tempo slows down]

56:35.217 --> 56:36.436
Where'd he go?

56:39.091 --> 56:40.179
Son of a bitch!

56:42.486 --> 56:44.226
Are you working
or playing around?

56:44.270 --> 56:45.837
Get your hands off me!

56:48.187 --> 56:49.710
Hey, Mike.

56:49.754 --> 56:51.233
Just here
by yourself, Biggs?

56:51.277 --> 56:53.018
Oh, I'm never alone.

56:54.106 --> 56:55.150
Get him out of here.

56:55.194 --> 56:56.195
Come on.

57:00.678 --> 57:02.331
What the hell was that?

57:02.375 --> 57:03.507
It's a tracker.

57:03.550 --> 57:04.812
Dodge doesn't have Rick.

57:04.856 --> 57:08.425
Are you saying that
as a cop or an ex-wife?

57:08.468 --> 57:09.730
Yeah, fuck you.

57:09.774 --> 57:11.428
You can find
your own fucking ride.

57:13.255 --> 57:15.257
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

57:16.520 --> 57:17.521
[car engine starts]

57:37.236 --> 57:38.498
Get in.

57:46.637 --> 57:49.248
- [Breslin] You're scary.
- [Carter] Good.

58:48.437 --> 58:49.613
[man whimpering]

59:06.717 --> 59:08.370
You gotta tell me
where Rick is.

59:12.940 --> 59:14.159
Where is he?

59:16.640 --> 59:18.380
- Where is he?
- [grunting]

59:18.424 --> 59:20.774
Where is Rick?
I know you know.

59:21.993 --> 59:24.648
Tell me where he is.
Just tell me where he is.

59:24.691 --> 59:25.866
[man screaming]

59:25.910 --> 59:28.608
Tell me where he is.
Tell me where he is.

59:28.652 --> 59:29.870
[screaming continues]

59:30.871 --> 59:32.612
[crying]

59:32.656 --> 59:35.746
Where is he?
Where is he?

59:35.789 --> 59:38.052
Tell me where he is.

59:38.096 --> 59:40.141
- Tell me where he is.
- [screaming]

59:43.188 --> 59:44.581

1:00:35.457 --> 1:00:36.371
[phone beeps]

1:00:42.203 --> 1:00:43.204
SÃ­.

1:00:57.610 --> 1:00:58.655
[Jack] Rick.

1:01:00.613 --> 1:01:02.441
Well, hi, Dad.

1:01:05.836 --> 1:01:07.141
Hey, you can't come
home now.

1:01:07.185 --> 1:01:08.403
[birds chirping]

1:01:09.404 --> 1:01:10.797
There's nothing more
I can do.

1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:15.672
What about Troy?

1:01:18.718 --> 1:01:20.111
I'll keep him safe.

1:01:22.504 --> 1:01:24.593
Keep Troy safe?

1:01:26.334 --> 1:01:29.163
Why do I not trust
that you can do that?

1:01:30.599 --> 1:01:32.210
I'll keep him out of it.

1:01:34.734 --> 1:01:35.648
Hmm.

1:01:38.259 --> 1:01:40.697
Listen, there's
a car out front.

1:01:40.740 --> 1:01:44.875
There's a passport
and some cash in the trunk.

1:01:44.918 --> 1:01:46.224
Go.

1:01:51.490 --> 1:01:52.404
[phone beeps]

1:02:06.984 --> 1:02:08.986
[groaning]

1:02:10.552 --> 1:02:12.380
Jack won't be calling back.

1:02:21.825 --> 1:02:23.087
I need to know something.

1:02:25.829 --> 1:02:29.484
The photos that you
sent my father--

1:02:31.791 --> 1:02:32.966
Where'd you get 'em?

1:02:33.010 --> 1:02:34.576
Uh...

1:02:35.752 --> 1:02:36.927
Where'd you get
the photos?

1:02:36.970 --> 1:02:38.232
Rick.

1:02:39.364 --> 1:02:41.322
Grindr, I don't know.

1:02:41.366 --> 1:02:43.672
MySpace, uh, Twitter?

1:02:45.283 --> 1:02:46.371
Get the bags.

1:02:46.414 --> 1:02:47.633
- How many bags?
- Two.

1:02:47.676 --> 1:02:50.767
No, um, ahem, three.

1:02:56.294 --> 1:02:57.904
We're gonna keep
your head on ice, Rick.

1:03:00.951 --> 1:03:03.170
And then my father's
gonna stuff your head
with explosives.

1:03:06.478 --> 1:03:09.089
And then we're gonna
send it to your son
for his next birthday.

1:03:11.222 --> 1:03:12.136
Boom.

1:03:13.485 --> 1:03:17.837
Don't-don't you think
that's a little immature?

1:03:17.881 --> 1:03:20.884
Fuck your dad.
What do you care?
Yeah, you're gay.

1:03:20.927 --> 1:03:24.191
You like guys,
who gives a fuck?

1:03:25.453 --> 1:03:26.541
Fuck your dad.

1:03:27.978 --> 1:03:29.022
Ha.

1:03:29.066 --> 1:03:31.503
- Let's go.
- Grow up!

1:03:34.898 --> 1:03:37.422
Well, okay, you got
us all out here.

1:03:37.465 --> 1:03:38.989
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

1:03:39.032 --> 1:03:40.991
Rick Calloway's been
sending me emails

1:03:41.034 --> 1:03:43.210
with information
since his arrest.

1:03:43.254 --> 1:03:46.997
This morning I received
a list of addresses
here in Lonoke.

1:03:47.040 --> 1:03:51.305
All right, I'll go fish.

1:03:51.349 --> 1:03:52.829
Where do we start?

1:03:52.872 --> 1:03:55.396
Here. If Rick's anywhere,
it's there.

1:03:55.440 --> 1:03:56.658
It's closest
to the airport.

1:03:58.486 --> 1:03:59.661
All right.

1:03:59.705 --> 1:04:01.359
All right, y'all,
let's load up.

1:04:01.402 --> 1:04:02.795
I'll ride with Will.

1:04:29.909 --> 1:04:31.650
My father likes to watch.

1:04:35.045 --> 1:04:36.046
[phone beeping]

1:04:37.221 --> 1:04:38.657
[line ringing]

1:04:40.311 --> 1:04:42.226
[Dodge] Jack,
Frank called.

1:04:43.575 --> 1:04:46.491
They found Rick.
I'm sorry, man.

1:04:46.534 --> 1:04:47.622
It's over.

1:04:51.061 --> 1:04:54.760
Please don't.
I swear, I-I don't--

1:04:56.588 --> 1:04:58.329
[screaming]

1:05:03.812 --> 1:05:05.727

1:05:23.441 --> 1:05:24.355

1:05:36.019 --> 1:05:36.933
[groans]

1:05:39.892 --> 1:05:41.328
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1:05:55.342 --> 1:05:56.387
[grunts]

1:06:01.131 --> 1:06:03.046
Holy shit!

1:06:05.874 --> 1:06:07.093
That's a lot of dough.

1:06:08.877 --> 1:06:10.357
Carter, we gotta go.

1:06:10.401 --> 1:06:12.098
There's an emergency
at your mom's house.

1:06:24.719 --> 1:06:26.504
No, no, don't, don't.

1:06:26.547 --> 1:06:27.766
[Rick groaning]

1:06:44.435 --> 1:06:45.871
[groaning continues]

1:07:03.062 --> 1:07:04.107
[knife squelching]

1:07:15.118 --> 1:07:16.510
Mom.

1:07:16.554 --> 1:07:18.077
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

1:07:18.121 --> 1:07:20.079
- I'm okay, baby.
Just look inside.
- Are you sure?

1:07:20.123 --> 1:07:21.472
- Did they hurt you?
- No, I'm okay.

1:07:21.515 --> 1:07:22.951
- Okay.
- I'm okay.

1:07:22.995 --> 1:07:24.257
- You stay right here,
okay? All right.
- Okay.

1:07:44.582 --> 1:07:45.800

1:09:04.531 --> 1:09:06.142
[police radio chatter]

1:09:14.193 --> 1:09:15.194
It was Dodge.

1:09:15.238 --> 1:09:16.848
[Carter] How do you know?

1:09:16.891 --> 1:09:18.241
[Breslin] Styles has been
keeping an eye on him
for me.

1:09:25.813 --> 1:09:27.641
The reason why Biggs
assigned you to me

1:09:27.685 --> 1:09:29.426
is because I'm expendable.

1:09:33.865 --> 1:09:36.650
My familyis expendable.

1:09:40.872 --> 1:09:42.047
You wanna find Rick,
get in.

1:09:51.361 --> 1:09:52.797
[coughing]

1:10:32.489 --> 1:10:34.230
Where is my wife?

1:10:39.887 --> 1:10:42.150
[Breslin on phone] Styles,
do you have a visual
on Dodge?

1:10:42.194 --> 1:10:44.588
- [computer trilling]
- Dodge is home.

1:10:44.631 --> 1:10:46.416
Looks like
he's making lunch.

1:10:46.459 --> 1:10:48.200
[Breslin] Keep an eye on him.

1:10:48.244 --> 1:10:49.723
- Yes, sir.
- [phone beeps]

1:10:59.342 --> 1:11:01.126
[groaning, panting]

1:11:21.059 --> 1:11:22.147
Fuck me.

1:15:06.545 --> 1:15:08.155
- You okay?
- I can't breathe. [gasping]

1:15:19.210 --> 1:15:20.254
I can't breathe.

1:15:20.298 --> 1:15:22.213
Slow deep breaths.
Come on.

1:15:23.214 --> 1:15:24.476
He's getting away.

1:15:28.393 --> 1:15:29.612
Let's just stay calm.

1:15:29.655 --> 1:15:31.265
Don't ever tell
a woman that.

1:15:31.309 --> 1:15:34.530
- [gasping]
- [dispatcher] Adam 12.

1:15:34.573 --> 1:15:36.053
Go for Adam 12.

1:15:36.096 --> 1:15:38.098
[dispatcher] There's a 245
at the Broadway Inn.

1:15:38.142 --> 1:15:39.360
Back up requested.

1:15:39.404 --> 1:15:40.927
You're gonna need to drive.

1:15:44.452 --> 1:15:45.758
[coughing]

1:15:46.759 --> 1:15:48.065
First time?

1:16:03.907 --> 1:16:05.082
[Pedro] Frank!

1:16:09.173 --> 1:16:10.827
Frank, there's something
you should see now.

1:16:10.870 --> 1:16:13.873
[Frank] Remember, fishing
takes patience, boys.

1:16:23.535 --> 1:16:26.016
John sent the live feed
of Calloway,
like you asked.

1:16:26.059 --> 1:16:27.974
It cut out for a bit,
but when it came back...

1:16:28.018 --> 1:16:29.106
[computer beeps]

1:16:31.543 --> 1:16:33.545
[grunting]

1:16:36.330 --> 1:16:37.505
[alarm tone]

1:16:37.549 --> 1:16:39.116
- Get the car.
- Yes, sir.

1:16:41.771 --> 1:16:43.207
[dispatcher] Uh,
can we get a car

1:16:43.250 --> 1:16:46.253
at the northeast corner
of Main and Fifth? Over.

1:16:53.478 --> 1:16:55.393
All cars in the area,
respond immediately.

1:16:55.436 --> 1:16:57.438
[police radio chatter continues]

1:17:08.972 --> 1:17:10.408
[phone ringing]

1:17:19.243 --> 1:17:20.113
[beeping]

1:17:20.157 --> 1:17:22.115
Jack, you there?

1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:25.031
I found your car.

1:17:25.075 --> 1:17:25.989
[sighs]

1:17:27.947 --> 1:17:29.122
Bring it home.

1:17:29.166 --> 1:17:30.428
All right.

1:17:31.516 --> 1:17:32.430
[phone beeps]

1:17:37.957 --> 1:17:39.959
[police radio chatter]

1:17:55.845 --> 1:17:57.673
My father, he, um...

1:17:58.717 --> 1:18:00.197
he wasn't a very good cop.

1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:04.027
I found him one morning

1:18:04.070 --> 1:18:06.507
washing blood off
of his hands
that wasn't his.

1:18:08.771 --> 1:18:11.251
He tried to explain but I--
I didn't wanna believe him.

1:18:14.515 --> 1:18:16.517
You're a good man,
Breslin.

1:18:18.171 --> 1:18:22.959
But if you don't leave,
this town will eat you alive.

1:18:25.788 --> 1:18:28.355
That-- that'd be all.
Thank you.

1:18:28.399 --> 1:18:31.402
No, didn't see
a goddamn thing.

1:18:31.445 --> 1:18:33.796
The-the cameras are off.

1:18:33.839 --> 1:18:35.798
- Let me talk to 'em.
- Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:18:35.841 --> 1:18:38.148
Now they're afraid.

1:18:38.191 --> 1:18:40.019
These people killed cops.

1:18:40.063 --> 1:18:43.849
What's to keep 'em
from killing a motel manager
and his family?

1:18:43.893 --> 1:18:45.416
Jesus!

1:18:45.459 --> 1:18:48.898
And, oh! Now I ran the rest
of the houses on your list.

1:18:50.682 --> 1:18:53.424
You got city council
members on there,

1:18:53.467 --> 1:18:54.730
you got Sheriff Dodge.

1:18:54.773 --> 1:18:57.733
Jack Calloway's
on that list,
for God's sakes.

1:18:57.776 --> 1:19:03.173
Mike, we know
who the bad guys are,
all right?

1:19:03.216 --> 1:19:06.742
And they-they-they know
where my grandkids go
to school, all right?

1:19:06.785 --> 1:19:08.787
They know
where my wife works.

1:19:08.831 --> 1:19:12.399
They know
where my mom is.

1:19:12.443 --> 1:19:14.793
It's a give and take
down here, okay?

1:19:14.837 --> 1:19:16.708
It's not an easy fix.

1:19:21.452 --> 1:19:23.802
Now the only thing they saw

1:19:23.846 --> 1:19:27.719
was a late model Mustang
driving away
after the gunfire.

1:19:31.114 --> 1:19:33.203
- Mike, that could be anybody!
- [engine starts]

1:19:34.813 --> 1:19:36.380
[Biggs] Goddamn!

1:19:37.860 --> 1:19:40.079
- Now I gotta go after him.
- [Carter] I'm going too.

1:19:51.612 --> 1:19:52.788
[phone ringing]

1:19:52.831 --> 1:19:54.833
- [phone beeps]
- Talk to me.

1:19:54.877 --> 1:19:56.052
[Paul] They found Rick.

1:19:56.095 --> 1:19:58.054
Dodge is bringing him
here now.

1:19:58.097 --> 1:20:00.230
I confirmed
Jack was hiding him.

1:20:00.273 --> 1:20:01.709
Then kill Jack Calloway.

1:20:01.753 --> 1:20:03.450
I'll pay you double
whatever he's paying you.

1:20:03.494 --> 1:20:06.410
But I want his son
for myself.

1:20:06.453 --> 1:20:07.803
With pleasure.

1:20:08.978 --> 1:20:09.892
[phone beeps]

1:20:19.640 --> 1:20:20.816
Come on, get up.

1:20:29.912 --> 1:20:30.826
[groans]

1:20:33.002 --> 1:20:34.917
- Hello, Rick.
- [groans]

1:20:36.527 --> 1:20:38.659
You should have
taken my deal.

1:20:38.703 --> 1:20:40.183
- Let's go.
- Ow.

1:20:44.796 --> 1:20:47.233
[Carter on radio] Mike, you
need to think about this.

1:20:47.277 --> 1:20:50.193
You have no backup
and these guys aren't
afraid to fight.

1:20:52.543 --> 1:20:53.631
- [radio beeps]
- [static]

1:21:07.253 --> 1:21:10.343
- [meat sizzling]
- Your mother used
to sing to you,

1:21:10.387 --> 1:21:15.087
every night when you were
a baby, with the cicadas,

1:21:15.131 --> 1:21:16.567
while I was cooking dinner.

1:21:18.351 --> 1:21:19.265
Dad...

1:21:20.527 --> 1:21:21.441
Yeah.

1:21:22.965 --> 1:21:24.053
Where is Troy?

1:21:25.358 --> 1:21:26.707
Well, there's
a carnival in town.

1:21:26.751 --> 1:21:29.145
He wanted to ride
the rollercoaster.

1:21:46.640 --> 1:21:48.425
[grunting, groaning]

1:21:50.644 --> 1:21:52.255
Get my boy down!

1:21:54.213 --> 1:21:56.824
Shh... Daddy--
Daddy's here.

1:21:56.868 --> 1:21:58.739
Daddy's here,
don't move.

1:22:02.091 --> 1:22:03.919
Funny,
'cause, um, John...

1:22:05.311 --> 1:22:09.272
told me about
Rachel, and I...

1:22:09.315 --> 1:22:10.490
John told you about it?

1:22:10.534 --> 1:22:11.927
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

1:22:11.970 --> 1:22:14.712
The whole story.
I know the truth now.

1:22:14.755 --> 1:22:16.148
It's okay, boy.
It's gonna be all right.

1:22:16.192 --> 1:22:17.497
- Help me pick him up.
- [whimpering]

1:22:19.238 --> 1:22:20.718
I know the truth.

1:22:21.762 --> 1:22:23.677
Come on, John
doesn't know shit.

1:22:23.721 --> 1:22:26.071
Rachel made a deal
with the DEA.

1:22:26.115 --> 1:22:28.813
Frank found out about it
and he had Dodge handle her.

1:22:28.856 --> 1:22:29.988
That's what happened.

1:22:35.298 --> 1:22:36.386
It was you.

1:22:38.301 --> 1:22:39.215
[grunts]

1:22:40.433 --> 1:22:41.652
[groans]

1:22:42.783 --> 1:22:44.046
- [exhaling sharply]
- [groaning]

1:22:53.490 --> 1:22:54.708
What are you doing?

1:22:54.752 --> 1:22:56.536
Well, we don't have
a warrant.

1:22:56.580 --> 1:22:58.495
I gotta make a few calls.

1:22:59.800 --> 1:23:00.976
Carter!

1:23:01.019 --> 1:23:02.325
Goddamn it!
Carter!

1:23:02.368 --> 1:23:03.804
[John groaning]

1:23:10.724 --> 1:23:12.422
Get help!

1:23:12.465 --> 1:23:14.032
Go get help!

1:23:14.076 --> 1:23:15.077
Run, run, Dad.

1:23:15.120 --> 1:23:16.904
Run, run, run,
please, run.

1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:19.995
- [Frank] What-what's wrong?
- [whimpering]

1:23:22.214 --> 1:23:24.042
Dad, run! Run, Dad!

1:23:37.186 --> 1:23:38.839
I loved her.

1:23:40.102 --> 1:23:43.192
You fucked up!
She was afraid of you!

1:23:46.151 --> 1:23:47.457
[sighs]

1:23:47.500 --> 1:23:48.936
Hello!

1:24:07.129 --> 1:24:09.087
[both grunting and groaning]

1:24:25.843 --> 1:24:27.453
[grunting and groaning continue]

1:24:41.293 --> 1:24:42.773
[grunting]

1:24:42.816 --> 1:24:44.383
Freeze!

1:24:59.268 --> 1:25:00.269
[groaning]

1:25:04.403 --> 1:25:06.188
You kill me,
and they'll fry you.

1:25:24.336 --> 1:25:25.903
[car engine starts]

1:25:31.430 --> 1:25:33.084
You feel it, right?

1:25:34.303 --> 1:25:37.741
You feel when somebody
you love betrays you.

1:25:42.659 --> 1:25:44.661
She was afraid
of you, bubba.

1:25:48.839 --> 1:25:50.449
She was afraid
of you and me.

1:25:54.671 --> 1:25:56.890
- That's the truth.
- You're...

1:25:59.023 --> 1:26:01.025
kind of a dick.

1:26:03.897 --> 1:26:05.464
Just don't lie
to my grandson.

1:26:05.508 --> 1:26:06.726
[grunts]

1:26:11.514 --> 1:26:12.602
Mike, stop.

1:26:19.304 --> 1:26:20.436
What are you doing?

1:26:20.479 --> 1:26:22.699
You gonna tell him, Zoe?

1:26:25.267 --> 1:26:26.398
I'm sorry, Mike.

1:26:33.927 --> 1:26:36.452
Zoe here, she'll do
anything for her family.

1:26:36.495 --> 1:26:37.714
Isn't that right, Zoe?

1:26:40.020 --> 1:26:41.108
Shoot him, Zoe.

1:26:45.243 --> 1:26:47.419
Shoot him now, Zoe.
Do it.

1:26:48.507 --> 1:26:50.335
Zoe.

1:26:50.379 --> 1:26:51.641
Zoe, you better shoot him.

1:26:52.772 --> 1:26:55.297
Whose side
are you on, Zoe?

1:26:55.340 --> 1:26:56.254
Zoe!

1:26:57.995 --> 1:26:58.909
Zoe!

1:27:00.084 --> 1:27:02.086
You better shoot him now!

1:27:14.577 --> 1:27:18.015
We blame this whole thing
on Dodge, yeah?

1:27:23.412 --> 1:27:24.848
[thunder rumbling]

1:27:27.590 --> 1:27:28.765
It's gonna rain.

1:27:30.332 --> 1:27:31.246
Fuck.

1:27:32.290 --> 1:27:33.900
[insects chirping]

1:27:38.557 --> 1:27:39.993
What the fuck?! What--

1:27:42.126 --> 1:27:43.083
[Rick grunting]

1:27:57.663 --> 1:27:58.925
[Dodge whimpering]

1:28:01.363 --> 1:28:03.539
Yo, Rick, I--
it wasn't my fault.

1:28:03.582 --> 1:28:05.280
I didn't--
I didn't wanna do it.

1:28:07.760 --> 1:28:11.373
Grief feels...

1:28:12.809 --> 1:28:15.202
so much like fear.

1:28:15.246 --> 1:28:16.595
Frank made me, man!

1:28:16.639 --> 1:28:18.815
I-I didn't wanna do it!
I didn't, I swear!

1:28:18.858 --> 1:28:20.599
I swear everything,
I tried to not do.

1:28:20.643 --> 1:28:22.862
I-I tried to fight.

1:28:22.906 --> 1:28:24.429
I'll-I will do anything.

1:28:24.473 --> 1:28:26.605
Come on, man!
I'm saying please!

1:28:28.694 --> 1:28:29.782
You know...

1:28:32.350 --> 1:28:36.267
I'm not being sarcastic
when I tell you

1:28:36.311 --> 1:28:38.269
that I--
I absolutely think

1:28:38.313 --> 1:28:40.227
that this is gonna be

1:28:40.271 --> 1:28:43.056
the best thing
that ever happened to you.

1:28:44.623 --> 1:28:47.365
Yeah, just think of it

1:28:47.409 --> 1:28:50.629
as a golden opportunity.

1:28:51.630 --> 1:28:53.632
[heavy rock music playing]

1:28:56.679 --> 1:28:57.549
Yeah.

1:28:57.593 --> 1:28:59.595
No, no, come on, Rick!

1:28:59.638 --> 1:29:01.597
Don't do this! [yelling]

1:29:04.513 --> 1:29:08.255
Rick, come on, please!
Please, don't do this!

1:29:08.299 --> 1:29:10.693
Please, Rick, please!

1:29:10.736 --> 1:29:11.911
Rick, no!

1:29:11.955 --> 1:29:14.131
[Dodge crying]

1:29:14.174 --> 1:29:16.438
Come on, please!
Please, don't do this!

1:29:16.481 --> 1:29:17.743
Please, Rick, please!

1:29:19.789 --> 1:29:21.791
[thunder rumbling]

1:29:42.725 --> 1:29:44.161
[joyous screaming]

1:29:47.207 --> 1:29:48.731
[thunderclap]

1:29:52.778 --> 1:29:54.563
- Troy?
- Dad!

1:30:03.963 --> 1:30:04.964
Rick!

1:30:23.156 --> 1:30:25.768
I never wanna
see you again!

1:30:41.566 --> 1:30:43.699
Hey, buddy.
How are you?

1:30:43.742 --> 1:30:45.527
Good.

1:30:45.570 --> 1:30:47.572
- It's raining a lot, huh?
- Yeah.

1:30:49.182 --> 1:30:52.708
- Do you want
a full-time job?
- Absolutely.

1:30:52.751 --> 1:30:54.361
'Cause I gotta--
I gotta tell you that I--

1:30:54.405 --> 1:30:56.538
I pay
a pretty good rate.

1:30:58.365 --> 1:31:00.063
Let's get out of here, huh?

1:31:27.482 --> 1:31:28.700
[phone ringing]

1:31:29.745 --> 1:31:31.790
[Shannon on recording]
Are you gonna have a belly?

1:31:31.834 --> 1:31:33.226
[Connors on phone]
We've had a hit.

1:31:33.270 --> 1:31:35.272
I'm forwarding the location
to you now.

1:31:35.315 --> 1:31:37.404
He's in Mexico City.

1:31:37.448 --> 1:31:39.058
- [Shannon chattering on video]
- Yeah.

1:31:39.102 --> 1:31:40.190
[Shannon] I'm so excited.

1:31:40.233 --> 1:31:41.974
You're gonna be dad.

1:31:42.018 --> 1:31:44.542
It's gonna be a boy, right?

1:31:48.415 --> 1:31:51.941
- So maybe it's a sign
It's a girl.
- It is a sign.

1:31:51.984 --> 1:31:55.031
I'm just kidding.
[continues indistinct]

1:32:01.037 --> 1:32:04.170
- [Shannon cheering, laughing]
- [Breslin laughs]

1:32:04.214 --> 1:32:06.521
- [Breslin] On three.
- [Shannon] One, two, three.

1:32:06.564 --> 1:32:08.218
[Shannon and Mike]
We're pregnant!
