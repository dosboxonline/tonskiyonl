01:31.425 --> 01:33.927
That's a beautiful pig.

01:34.511 --> 01:38.140
Only the best, Father.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.767
This way, Father.

02:01.580 --> 02:06.668
The boy is showing all the classical signs
of possession, Father Amorth.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.755
Has the family consulted a doctor?

02:10.339 --> 02:12.966
Many, many doctors.

02:14.092 --> 02:17.137
What are the signs of possession?

02:17.721 --> 02:20.015
He converses in English, Father.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.227
Has he spoken English before?

02:23.310 --> 02:25.187
Never. Not once before.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.190
Do they own a television?

02:28.941 --> 02:30.150
Yes, I believe so.

02:31.944 --> 02:33.487
Okay, thank you.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.330
What are you drawing?

02:43.413 --> 02:44.623
A bird.

02:46.667 --> 02:50.546
That's good, kid.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.717
I have a very important job for you.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.556
Do you know the Our Father?

03:01.139 --> 03:03.600
-Yes, Father.
-Good.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.648
You can help your brother.

03:09.731 --> 03:15.821
Repeat the Our Father, over and over.

03:16.405 --> 03:21.410
Don't get distracted.
Relentless. Understood?

03:23.287 --> 03:24.663
Yes, Father.

03:25.497 --> 03:26.331
Good.

03:28.083 --> 03:34.423
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

03:39.219 --> 03:40.846
Bring me the pig.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.330
I am legion.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.501
I am Satan.

04:13.253 --> 04:17.089
I am foul-mouthed behemoth.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.636
Difficult to believe.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.890
You doubt me?

04:24.973 --> 04:28.685
If you are Satan, what is my name?

04:31.438 --> 04:33.148
Describe hell.

04:35.651 --> 04:39.112
You will find out soon enough.

04:39.655 --> 04:41.949
Are you avoiding my questions?

04:42.032 --> 04:43.158
You mock me?

04:50.582 --> 04:52.960
Answer me, Satan.

04:55.838 --> 04:58.924
Why possess this boy?

04:59.007 --> 05:01.552
Why not someone more influential?

05:01.635 --> 05:06.431
I can possess anyone I choose.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.395
Could you possess Father Gianni?

05:12.479 --> 05:13.605
A bishop?

05:13.689 --> 05:15.732
Anyone! Anything!

05:16.567 --> 05:18.068
I do not believe you.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.572
I don't believe
you could even possess this pig.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.700
Can you do it? You have the power.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.535
Could you possess the pig?

05:26.618 --> 05:28.245
-Yes, I can.
-Come on, Satan.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.788
-Watch me!
-Possess the pig.

05:29.872 --> 05:32.207
Show me you are the Prince of Darkness.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.335
Show to me your power.

05:35.419 --> 05:36.420
Have you done it?

05:36.503 --> 05:38.380
Have you possessed him, Satan?

05:40.299 --> 05:42.217
Have you possessed it, Satan?

05:53.478 --> 05:54.646
Be calm.

05:55.981 --> 05:58.942
God blesses you.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.694
You can sleep now, my son.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.613
The demon has gone.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.287
<i>God is with you.</i>

07:06.009 --> 07:09.555
Amy, we're not in America anymore.
You can't dress like that.

07:11.056 --> 07:11.890
Why?

07:11.974 --> 07:14.601
Because there's gonna be
construction workers everywhere.

07:17.646 --> 07:18.981
How you doing back there?

07:50.554 --> 07:53.223
So we left everything for this?

07:53.307 --> 07:55.225
Amy, please. Don't start.

07:55.309 --> 07:59.188
-You know exactly what I'm gonna say.
-Yes, and I don't wanna hear it.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.983
What do you think? Pretty cool, huh?

08:05.611 --> 08:06.904
Yeah, I know.

08:16.830 --> 08:17.706
Cuckoo!

08:26.381 --> 08:27.508
Gabriele.

08:29.885 --> 08:35.515
Why do you think Saint Michael didn't
kill Satan when he had the chance?

08:36.183 --> 08:38.894
That is a question of theology.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.356
No shit.

08:42.438 --> 08:46.735
Perhaps it was his mercy
that stayed Saint Michael's sword.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.404
The only thing that arrests God's love

08:50.155 --> 08:52.449
is a person's freedom to choose.

08:53.075 --> 08:57.996
But God cannot be God
unless he allows for this choice

08:58.080 --> 08:59.706
even for the damned.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.834
Saint Michael, he knows this.

09:03.293 --> 09:06.129
We will all be judged.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.631
We will all be judged

09:08.423 --> 09:10.217
by how much we love.

09:11.510 --> 09:13.470
Do not worry, Gabriele.

09:14.263 --> 09:16.890
I will defend you.

09:16.974 --> 09:18.141
Defend me?

09:21.353 --> 09:22.479
My faith

09:23.230 --> 09:24.982
does not require defense.

09:34.241 --> 09:37.077
-What do you think, guys?
-Cozy.

09:37.160 --> 09:40.539
Oh, come on.
Give it a chance. This is awesome.

09:41.456 --> 09:44.001
-Señora Vasquez.
-Carlos, hi!

09:44.084 --> 09:45.794
So nice to put a face to the voice.

09:47.796 --> 09:50.215
<i>Padre--</i> Father Esquibel...

09:50.299 --> 09:52.926
-Pleasure to meet you, Miss Vasquez.
-Julia, please.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.596
-Carlos was giving me a tour.
-Oh, great.

09:55.679 --> 09:58.515
I just wanted to stop by
and welcome you and your family

09:58.599 --> 09:59.766
-to the diocese.
-I'm sorry.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.476
Oh, no, no, no, please. Go for it.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.353
I'm glad to see you made it safe.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.814
All right. Go find your room, twerp.

10:11.904 --> 10:13.989
Hey. Can I get one of those?

10:14.072 --> 10:15.240
Yes, of course.

10:15.324 --> 10:17.576
This property has been in disrepair

10:17.659 --> 10:19.453
-for as long as I can remember.
-Thank you.

10:19.536 --> 10:23.207
So it's a wonderful thing you're doing,
restoring the abbey.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.959
We are being very respectful
of the existing architecture.

10:26.043 --> 10:28.921
This has actually been
in my husband's family for generations,

10:29.004 --> 10:30.547
and we just inherited it.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.633
Is Mr. Vasquez here or--?

10:32.716 --> 10:36.386
Oh, he passed, actually. About a year ago.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.639
-I'm sorry for your loss.
-It's okay.

10:38.722 --> 10:42.392
If you need anything,
please don't hesitate.

10:42.476 --> 10:43.352
Okay.

10:43.936 --> 10:45.687
I will remember him in my prayers.

10:45.771 --> 10:48.565
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Thank you. It was nice to meet you.

10:49.066 --> 10:51.401
Okay, Carlos, talk to me.
What's up? Where are we at?

10:51.485 --> 10:53.612
The basement excavation
is very complicated.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.948
-So more expensive, then, you mean?
-I'm afraid so.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.991
All right. I'll take another look
at the plans.

10:58.075 --> 11:01.203
If you could just show me what the
basement looks like, maybe I can wire--

11:01.286 --> 11:04.414
Amy, get off of there
before you break your neck.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.417
Is that a cigarette?
Put that out right now, please.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.086
-Fine.
-No! Oh, my God.

11:45.873 --> 11:46.790
Cute.

11:47.291 --> 11:48.500
Get out of my room.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.095
Hey, have you seen your brother?

13:24.763 --> 13:25.597
Amy.

13:30.811 --> 13:36.108
Look, I really can't handle
the silent treatment from both my kids.

13:37.568 --> 13:40.195
-I know you don't wanna be here.
-Yeah, no shit.

13:40.279 --> 13:41.113
Amy.

13:42.072 --> 13:44.700
Please, I need your help.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.827
This abbey is the only thing
your dad left us.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.453
We don't have an income anymore.

13:48.537 --> 13:51.874
Once we fix it up and sell it,
we'll go home. Okay?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.627
Maybe if you could just
at least watch your brother.

13:55.711 --> 13:57.212
Maybe try and get him to talk.

13:57.296 --> 13:59.840
How? He hasn't spoken in almost a year.

14:00.549 --> 14:02.301
Can you try for me?

14:02.384 --> 14:04.303
So you want me to be a mother for you?

14:04.386 --> 14:07.264
Please just keep an eye
on your brother. Okay?

14:32.289 --> 14:33.123
Hold this.

14:40.631 --> 14:43.926
Father Amorth, caffe latte?

14:44.009 --> 14:47.304
At this time of the day? Are you crazy?

14:49.223 --> 14:51.558
Double espresso, Sister.

14:51.642 --> 14:52.809
Thank you.

14:52.893 --> 14:54.102
Sugar?

14:54.186 --> 14:57.523
Sugar is the work of the devil.
No, thank you.

15:01.902 --> 15:02.945
Thank you very much.

15:05.948 --> 15:08.450
Let's get on with this already.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.787
This is a formal hearing.

15:11.870 --> 15:15.040
And as agreed,
proceedings will be undertaken in English.

15:15.624 --> 15:17.918
All right, let's go.

15:18.001 --> 15:20.838
On the night of June 4th,
in the town of Tropea,

15:21.421 --> 15:23.173
you performed an exorcism

15:23.257 --> 15:26.718
without the approval
of the Reggio Calabria bishop.

15:27.344 --> 15:28.679
It wasn't a--

15:28.762 --> 15:30.305
In English, Father Amorth.

15:32.432 --> 15:35.185
That was not an exorcism.

15:35.269 --> 15:38.939
From Father Gianni's description,
what occurred in Reggio Calabria sounded

15:39.022 --> 15:42.943
exactly like an exorcism,
complete with animal sacrifice, no less.

15:43.026 --> 15:46.071
The boy was maladjusted.
A temporary mental illness.

15:46.154 --> 15:48.866
I use primitive psychology.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.118
The power of suggestion.

15:51.201 --> 15:55.581
You addressed the subject as Satan,
called for him to display his power.

15:56.540 --> 15:58.292
-Do you deny this?
-No.

15:59.126 --> 16:01.670
-That's what I did.
-And why would you do that?

16:01.753 --> 16:03.463
Exorcism is my job,

16:04.006 --> 16:07.092
but the vast majority of the cases
to which I'm assigned

16:07.176 --> 16:09.928
do not require an exorcism.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.390
They just need a little conversation,

16:14.183 --> 16:16.018
a little understanding,

16:16.101 --> 16:17.519
and sometimes...

16:18.729 --> 16:19.938
a little theater.

16:20.522 --> 16:23.567
Cardinal Sullivan, in my observation,

16:24.109 --> 16:27.321
98% of the cases
that are assigned to Father Amorth

16:27.404 --> 16:30.324
are then further recommended by him

16:30.407 --> 16:32.784
to doctors and psychiatrists.

16:32.868 --> 16:34.328
And the other 2%?

16:35.454 --> 16:36.955
The other 2%.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.709
This is something
that has confounded all of science

16:40.792 --> 16:43.003
and all of medicine for a very long time.

16:46.089 --> 16:47.382
I call it...

16:48.884 --> 16:50.636
-evil.
-Your Eminence,

16:50.719 --> 16:52.971
with hundreds of successful exorcisms,

16:53.055 --> 16:57.559
-Father Amorth has been very effective--
-One moment, Bishop Lumumba.

16:58.977 --> 17:01.313
You do raise an interesting point, Amorth.

17:01.897 --> 17:04.983
You are not a doctor,
but these practices of yours

17:05.067 --> 17:07.109
could have damaging effects
on these people.

17:07.778 --> 17:08.779
You are right.

17:09.570 --> 17:10.948
I am not a doctor.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.867
I am not a psychologist.

17:15.327 --> 17:17.538
But I am a theologian, I am a lawyer,

17:17.621 --> 17:20.457
I am a journalist,
and I am a practical man.

17:20.958 --> 17:25.628
I was also a partisan in the war,
so I know a firing squad when I see one.

17:28.841 --> 17:30.384
So, what is this about?

17:30.467 --> 17:32.803
The Congregation
for the Doctrine of the Faith

17:32.886 --> 17:34.471
has recommended to this panel

17:34.972 --> 17:39.893
that the position of chief exorcist
be formally vacated.

17:39.977 --> 17:42.771
So, what you are saying
is that evil does not exist?

17:42.855 --> 17:45.774
The Church is under constant pressure
to sharpen her relevance.

17:45.858 --> 17:48.652
It's time we move past
these outdated beliefs.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.071
Explain to me please, Your Eminence.

17:51.572 --> 17:53.073
If evil does not exist,

17:53.657 --> 17:57.119
what, then, is the role of the Church?

17:58.745 --> 18:03.000
I think we all have to be careful of the
Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith.

18:03.542 --> 18:06.336
Sounds to me
like they want us all out of a job.

18:11.925 --> 18:14.386
We have more questions for you,
Father Amorth.

18:18.056 --> 18:20.601
How is it that I am suddenly worthy

18:20.684 --> 18:23.312
of the time and attention
of all you powerful men?

18:24.021 --> 18:25.230
I ask you again...

18:26.523 --> 18:27.858
what is this about?

18:27.941 --> 18:29.276
Due process, Father.

18:29.359 --> 18:32.696
So this is not about the dead girl,
Rosaria Velendez,

18:32.779 --> 18:35.616
<i>that I write about
in</i> La Madre di Dio <i>magazine?</i>

18:35.699 --> 18:37.951
What is your due diligence
and process on this?

18:38.035 --> 18:41.038
-Please, cardinal.
-I warn you! I warn you! Father Amorth,

18:41.121 --> 18:42.831
show respect to your superiors.

18:42.915 --> 18:44.291
I do!

18:44.374 --> 18:46.793
I am the chief exorcist of the Vatican.

18:46.877 --> 18:49.796
My position was appointed by my bishop.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.673
My diocese is Rome.

18:51.757 --> 18:53.509
My local bishop is the pope.

18:54.009 --> 18:55.719
If you have a problem with me,

18:56.428 --> 18:58.472
you talk to my boss. Okay?

18:59.348 --> 19:01.391
The pope is infirm.

19:01.475 --> 19:03.393
Father Amorth,
you have not been dismissed.

19:03.477 --> 19:04.978
-Cuckoo.
-Father Amorth!

19:58.824 --> 19:59.658
Hello?

20:01.618 --> 20:02.661
Anyone there?

20:56.215 --> 21:00.010
I can't wait to finish this job.
This place freaks me out.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.437
What is it?

21:13.023 --> 21:15.067
I don't know. Can't see anything.

21:38.715 --> 21:39.925
They hit a gas deposit.

21:40.509 --> 21:44.179
We can't continue working here.
I'm pulling my team from this place.

21:45.264 --> 21:47.349
Come on, let's go. Come on, everybody out.

21:47.432 --> 21:48.267
Wait.

21:49.810 --> 21:50.978
Quick, quick.

22:05.784 --> 22:06.618
Henry?

22:07.244 --> 22:08.662
No. Henry!

22:09.955 --> 22:10.831
Mom!

22:12.291 --> 22:15.210
Oh, my God!
Henry! What is happening?

22:15.294 --> 22:17.212
I don't know,
he was like this when I came in.

22:17.296 --> 22:19.631
Henry? Henry, it's Mommy.

22:19.715 --> 22:20.591
Talk to me.

22:21.758 --> 22:23.927
-Henry.
-Mommy.

22:24.011 --> 22:24.928
He's talking.

22:25.429 --> 22:27.931
-Henry.
-Mommy.

22:33.770 --> 22:35.772
You're all going to die.

22:36.940 --> 22:40.360
-Henry! What are you doing? Henry! Henry!
-Henry! Henry!

22:51.163 --> 22:53.624
<i>X-rays, blood tests, even the spinal tap</i>

22:53.707 --> 22:56.585
and MRI show no results
of ischemia or hematoma.

22:57.211 --> 22:58.462
What does that mean?

23:02.424 --> 23:06.678
All of his vitals and brain functions
seem to be normal.

23:06.762 --> 23:10.432
Wait, normal? What do you mean?
He was convulsing.

23:12.601 --> 23:14.978
Has he been through any trauma recently?

23:20.609 --> 23:24.404
Yeah, his dad died about a year ago.

23:27.533 --> 23:28.951
And how did he react?

23:31.203 --> 23:32.746
He hasn't spoken since.

23:37.501 --> 23:39.127
Wha-- Psychosis?

23:39.211 --> 23:41.255
No, that's not possible.
He's just a little boy.

23:41.338 --> 23:45.092
Ma'am, there is nothing
that we can do now.

23:45.175 --> 23:48.595
-But he can recommend a good psychiatrist.
-What is this?

23:51.515 --> 23:54.184
If your son continues
trying to hurt himself,

23:54.268 --> 23:56.270
-you can administer him this sedative.
-No.

23:56.854 --> 23:58.146
-Mom.
-I'm so sorry.

23:58.814 --> 23:59.815
Baby.

23:59.898 --> 24:01.108
Oh, my God.

24:08.115 --> 24:10.158
No, I don't think you understand.

24:10.868 --> 24:13.287
But this is an emergency, please.

24:13.370 --> 24:18.500
No, I need to talk to someone
at the consulate who can help me.

24:18.584 --> 24:20.210
I need a specialist.

24:21.795 --> 24:22.629
Okay.

24:24.214 --> 24:25.174
Okay.

24:25.966 --> 24:27.259
Yes, please.

24:48.322 --> 24:49.615
Baby.

24:53.452 --> 24:54.286
Hey.

24:55.495 --> 24:57.623
My love, come here.

25:17.476 --> 25:18.393
Fuck this.

25:25.442 --> 25:26.318
Henry, no.

25:27.194 --> 25:28.612
Henry, stop!

25:28.695 --> 25:30.489
This baby's hungry, you fat cow.

25:30.572 --> 25:31.865
What? What are you saying?

25:32.491 --> 25:34.493
You never breastfed me, Mommy.

25:34.576 --> 25:35.702
-What?
-What the fuck?

25:41.708 --> 25:43.210
What the fuck is that?

25:43.293 --> 25:45.879
Bring me the priest.

25:47.214 --> 25:49.091
-Can you help us?
-Yes.

25:50.050 --> 25:51.510
I'm here to help, Julia.

25:51.593 --> 25:52.427
Okay.

26:07.985 --> 26:10.904
Wrong fucking priest!

26:27.546 --> 26:31.049
-Is that you, Gabriele?
-Yes, Holy Father.

26:32.050 --> 26:34.261
They tell me you are sick.

26:34.344 --> 26:36.597
Yes, they hope so.

26:37.472 --> 26:39.349
They wish to see me weak.

26:39.433 --> 26:41.435
But, no, they are.

26:44.938 --> 26:46.607
-Help me.
-Yes.

27:07.669 --> 27:11.215
Perhaps we've done our jobs too well.

27:11.298 --> 27:13.926
Cardinal Sullivan
and the younger generation,

27:14.009 --> 27:17.054
they don't believe in the devil
as we understand it.

27:17.804 --> 27:23.769
It's only an idea for them.
For us, it is very real.

27:24.561 --> 27:26.480
Two hundred fallen angels,

27:26.563 --> 27:30.108
expelled from heaven, driven beneath
the soil where God is not welcomed.

27:31.235 --> 27:33.111
It is not a fairytale.

27:34.238 --> 27:38.075
Your search for truth
is delightful, Gabriele,

27:38.158 --> 27:41.995
but pay attention
to your desire to educate.

27:42.079 --> 27:46.416
Pride manifests itself in different forms.

27:48.043 --> 27:50.420
Pride? Me?

27:53.924 --> 27:56.343
There's a case that needs your attention.

27:57.010 --> 27:58.428
A boy in Spain.

27:59.012 --> 28:03.267
Something about it disturbs me greatly.

28:05.853 --> 28:09.815
<i>This boy's possession
is progressing very fast.</i>

28:11.275 --> 28:14.570
<i>The incident took place
in hallowed ground,</i>

28:14.653 --> 28:17.406
<i>San Sebastian Abbey in Castile.</i>

28:19.867 --> 28:23.161
This place
has given the Church problems before.

28:24.246 --> 28:27.499
<i>I sense a great evil coming from there.</i>

28:28.041 --> 28:32.588
<i>Something dark
that only you can help solve.</i>

28:34.047 --> 28:37.885
<i>I have requested the abbey's records
be brought to you in the library.</i>

28:39.469 --> 28:40.429
<i>Look into it.</i>

28:41.847 --> 28:45.893
<i>I will continue investigating
while you're on your journey.</i>

28:50.856 --> 28:52.232
"Our sins...

28:53.650 --> 28:55.819
will seek us out."

28:57.070 --> 28:58.322
<i>Gabriele.</i>

28:58.405 --> 29:01.867
Go to Spain, and help this child.

29:02.492 --> 29:06.538
But be careful,
this demon sounds dangerous.

30:03.220 --> 30:04.304
Hello?

30:35.210 --> 30:36.253
Father.

30:37.296 --> 30:40.507
Good morning.
I'm Father Tomás Esquibel.

30:41.633 --> 30:42.843
-Spanish?
-Yes.

30:43.719 --> 30:46.430
I am Father Amorth. Italian.

30:48.307 --> 30:51.476
-Wait. Father Amorth?
-Yes.

30:52.603 --> 30:55.063
I didn't expect them to send you.

30:55.147 --> 30:56.148
You know me?

30:56.231 --> 31:00.402
Yes. I have read all the articles.

31:00.485 --> 31:03.363
-And the books?
-No, no. No, not the books.

31:04.781 --> 31:05.741
The books are good.

31:05.824 --> 31:08.744
-I will read--
-Okay. I'll just get my bag.

31:08.827 --> 31:11.038
You... Whiskey?

31:11.914 --> 31:13.040
No, no, no. Thank you.

31:13.832 --> 31:16.752
Yeah, this sore throat, the dust.

31:20.464 --> 31:23.842
Julia, we have been extremely lucky.
The Church sent someone.

31:23.926 --> 31:26.595
An expert in these matters.
Gabriele, please come in.

31:28.263 --> 31:32.142
Good morning, good morning, good morning.
I am Father Amorth.

31:32.935 --> 31:34.311
I have come from Roma.

31:34.394 --> 31:35.854
Gabriele, how are you?

31:37.189 --> 31:39.024
I'm sorry that you came all this way,

31:39.107 --> 31:41.818
but I don't even know
why the Church is interested in this.

31:41.902 --> 31:43.487
I just want my son to be well.

31:43.570 --> 31:44.404
Yes, yes.

31:44.488 --> 31:48.575
Tell me something,
have the doctors given you any answers?

31:49.076 --> 31:50.327
Any comfort?

31:50.994 --> 31:53.080
If you would at least...

31:54.289 --> 31:55.874
just let me see your son.

31:57.167 --> 32:00.295
I can give you my opinion
and you can do with it what you will.

32:05.634 --> 32:06.510
It's worth a shot.

32:10.138 --> 32:11.598
Okay. He's upstairs.

32:13.058 --> 32:15.644
Very nice, this.

32:17.688 --> 32:19.106
Hello, my friend.

32:38.166 --> 32:39.001
Henry.

32:40.085 --> 32:41.295
Are you awake?

33:39.144 --> 33:42.189
Our Father, who art in heaven,

33:42.272 --> 33:46.360
hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come, thy will be--

33:46.443 --> 33:49.363
Your prayers are worthless here.

34:23.605 --> 34:24.898
Who are you?

34:24.982 --> 34:29.652
Your worst fear. I am your demise.

34:30.779 --> 34:32.822
Why are you possessing this boy?

34:32.906 --> 34:37.744
Because it feels so good
to ruin such innocent flesh.

34:38.411 --> 34:42.206
But I prefer the challenge
of an exorcist's soul.

34:42.291 --> 34:44.585
You only serve to diminish yourself.

34:44.668 --> 34:47.004
Don't lecture me, priest.

34:47.087 --> 34:48.505
What is your purpose?

34:48.589 --> 34:50.549
I'm here for you.

34:52.467 --> 34:54.636
Then you must know my name.

34:55.262 --> 34:59.558
I know your soul and every shameless sin.

35:00.934 --> 35:03.061
Tell me one of my sins.

35:06.273 --> 35:07.399
You cannot.

35:08.859 --> 35:12.571
Because my sins have been absolved
by the one true master,

35:12.654 --> 35:14.656
-the Lord Jesus Christ.
-Do not speak of him.

35:14.740 --> 35:18.035
Are you afraid of him?
Are you afraid of Jesus Christ?

35:19.912 --> 35:22.289
God is not here.

35:22.998 --> 35:25.501
God is everywhere.

35:26.418 --> 35:27.711
Whatever you do...

35:28.879 --> 35:31.089
you only do because God allows it.

35:34.551 --> 35:35.969
Did he allow that?

35:36.887 --> 35:38.680
This is just the beginning.

35:38.764 --> 35:40.724
You don't know who you're dealing with.

35:41.892 --> 35:44.645
Then tell me. Tell me your name.

35:45.229 --> 35:46.730
Unless you are too afraid.

35:46.813 --> 35:51.109
I'm not some stupid fuck
you convince to get into a pig.

35:51.693 --> 35:53.779
So you won't tell me your name.

35:54.404 --> 35:57.241
My name is blasphemy.

35:57.991 --> 36:01.954
My name is nightmare.

36:07.960 --> 36:09.294
My nightmare...

36:10.462 --> 36:13.257
is France winning the World Cup.

36:13.340 --> 36:15.300
You prideful fool.

36:15.384 --> 36:18.262
You can't hide
behind your jokes forever...

36:19.680 --> 36:21.640
Gabriele.

36:22.933 --> 36:25.102
I know your nightmares too.

36:47.082 --> 36:49.793
Show yourself, coward.

36:52.504 --> 36:54.089
Show yourself.

36:55.299 --> 36:56.633
Coward.

36:57.634 --> 37:00.179
Show yourself, coward.

37:20.866 --> 37:24.494
Beware, your sins will seek you out.

37:27.623 --> 37:30.626
I'll be waiting for you, Gabe.

37:33.420 --> 37:35.672
Did you mention my name
to anyone in this house?

37:36.548 --> 37:37.633
Maybe, I'm not sure.

37:38.217 --> 37:42.888
This demon, it says things
that it could not know.

37:44.056 --> 37:46.016
So it's real?

37:47.059 --> 37:48.769
What do you know about demons?

37:50.521 --> 37:54.274
Only the basics,
that they are fallen angels.

37:54.858 --> 37:56.610
One serves the other in a hierarchy.

37:56.693 --> 37:57.528
Yes.

37:58.237 --> 38:02.491
The higher the demon,
the more access it can have.

38:02.991 --> 38:04.701
So why is it possessing the boy?

38:04.785 --> 38:08.372
This is a very good question.
I'm going to talk to the mother.

38:08.455 --> 38:11.291
I need to work out
why this demon has chosen Henry.

38:11.917 --> 38:16.713
What I am about to say may be difficult.
Confronting.

38:18.340 --> 38:23.637
Your son is under the influence
of a very powerful demon.

38:24.304 --> 38:27.140
Removing the boy
from this place could be fatal.

38:28.058 --> 38:29.601
I say to you now...

38:30.519 --> 38:35.649
the only way your son
comes back to you is through faith.

38:37.985 --> 38:41.363
Mrs. Vasquez,
did anything happen to Henry?

38:42.614 --> 38:45.200
He was in the car accident
that killed his father.

38:46.743 --> 38:48.871
He saw his father impaled.

38:53.292 --> 38:56.295
That memory, that's his demon.

38:57.212 --> 38:59.006
I give you my word,

38:59.590 --> 39:02.384
I will not walk away from you,
or your son.

39:05.053 --> 39:08.682
Trauma such as you describe
can be a gateway for the devil.

39:10.100 --> 39:14.396
Suffering can make a soul
desperate for connection.

39:15.314 --> 39:17.941
It can make the innocent more vulnerable.

39:22.946 --> 39:25.532
You must have loved your husband
very much.

39:28.702 --> 39:29.953
You have no idea.

39:31.538 --> 39:35.292
He was your soul connection, <i>sì?</i>

39:37.419 --> 39:38.879
He was everything.

39:42.132 --> 39:44.259
And you have two beautiful children.

39:46.136 --> 39:51.475
A mother's love is the closest thing
we know to God's love.

39:55.020 --> 39:56.230
Tell me, Julia.

39:59.191 --> 40:00.692
Have you ever believed?

40:02.861 --> 40:04.821
When I was a little girl...

40:06.865 --> 40:10.327
I used to think that
my guardian angel walked me to school.

40:14.373 --> 40:16.750
You should pray to that guardian angel.

40:33.559 --> 40:34.601
Henry?

40:47.155 --> 40:47.990
Henry?

41:04.548 --> 41:05.966
Amy.

41:09.178 --> 41:11.013
I'm in hell.

41:26.904 --> 41:30.908
<i>Amy, honey, it's Dad.
You have to listen, okay?</i>

41:30.991 --> 41:32.034
Daddy?

41:32.117 --> 41:34.161
<i>You're all going to die.</i>

41:36.914 --> 41:38.790
Mom! Mom!

41:38.874 --> 41:40.918
Mom, it was Daddy. It was Dad.

41:41.001 --> 41:43.545
I heard Dad's voice.
I heard his voice on the phone.

41:43.629 --> 41:45.339
-He said that we're all gonna die.
-What?

41:45.422 --> 41:48.008
-He said that we were all gonna die.
-Oh, my God.

41:52.513 --> 41:53.347
What do we do?

41:55.390 --> 41:56.225
Coffee.

41:59.019 --> 42:02.147
The demons,
they grow more strongly in the night.

42:02.231 --> 42:05.817
I'm going to need my energy.
But you should try to get some rest.

42:07.319 --> 42:09.947
And may the souls
of all the faithful departed,

42:10.030 --> 42:13.784
through the mercy of God,
rest in peace.

42:13.867 --> 42:16.537
-Amen.
-How long will this take?

42:16.620 --> 42:17.538
That is hard to say.

42:18.121 --> 42:19.081
Hours.

42:20.165 --> 42:21.625
Days, maybe.

42:21.708 --> 42:23.377
This demon is very strong.

42:23.460 --> 42:25.504
The boy won't last long.

42:25.587 --> 42:29.800
What we need to do is to find out its name
in order to exorcise it.

42:29.883 --> 42:32.177
That is the only way we can save the boy.

42:32.761 --> 42:33.887
How do we do that?

42:34.429 --> 42:35.389
With prayer.

42:35.472 --> 42:36.849
Constant prayer.

42:37.641 --> 42:40.727
The demons, they are self-preserving.

42:40.811 --> 42:42.771
They do not understand suffering.

42:42.855 --> 42:44.857
Eventually, he will give himself up

42:44.940 --> 42:48.193
because he cannot stand
the pain of the prayer.

42:48.277 --> 42:49.236
You understand me?

42:49.778 --> 42:51.405
-Yes.
-Good. Good.

42:51.488 --> 42:54.324
-Now, you must confess your sins.
-Now?

42:54.408 --> 42:56.910
The demon can smell your sins
if they are not absolved.

42:56.994 --> 42:57.911
Come.

43:00.664 --> 43:01.582
We begin.

43:04.042 --> 43:05.377
Forgive me, Father...

43:06.295 --> 43:07.462
for I have sinned.

43:07.546 --> 43:08.547
It has been...

43:09.882 --> 43:12.050
-eight months since my last confession--
-<i>Padre</i>, no.

43:12.134 --> 43:15.095
Did you just say eight months
since your last confession?

43:16.221 --> 43:17.723
-Yes.
-I...

43:19.391 --> 43:21.101
Okay, we just have to get this done.

43:21.185 --> 43:24.062
-You are a man of God, simple enough, <i>sì?
</i>-Yes.

43:24.146 --> 43:26.231
And you are very, very sorry
for all of your sins.

43:27.065 --> 43:28.400
-Yes.
-Okay.

43:28.483 --> 43:31.278
May almighty God have mercy on you,

43:31.361 --> 43:37.284
and having forgiven your sins,
lead you to eternal peace. Amen.

43:37.367 --> 43:39.536
What rites of the exorcism do you know?

43:40.662 --> 43:42.164
-None.
-None?

43:42.748 --> 43:43.832
It has never come up.

43:43.916 --> 43:47.211
What prayer do you know that you could say
over and over, even under pressure?

43:49.004 --> 43:50.047
The Hail Mary.

43:51.465 --> 43:55.677
But if it is under pressure,
I would prefer to say it in Spanish.

43:55.761 --> 43:56.595
That's fine.

43:57.679 --> 44:00.349
Your job is to pray.

44:01.225 --> 44:03.185
Do not engage with the demon.

44:03.268 --> 44:06.855
Do not respond
to anything it says or does.

44:06.939 --> 44:09.107
Your job is to be <i>implacabile.</i>

44:09.191 --> 44:11.652
Relentless. Okay?

44:12.736 --> 44:13.862
Good boy.

44:15.113 --> 44:17.741
-You know any jokes?
-No.

44:17.824 --> 44:20.827
You should learn some.
The devil does not like jokes.

44:22.037 --> 44:22.871
Bring the books.

44:26.166 --> 44:28.877
The scent of heaven.

44:28.961 --> 44:31.964
I see you've brought your friend.

44:32.047 --> 44:35.300
He looks a little scared, Gabe.

44:35.384 --> 44:40.556
Mind if I call you Gabe, Gabe?

44:41.515 --> 44:43.600
Readying for battle?

44:43.684 --> 44:49.898
You ran out on me last time,
like the coward you are, soldier boy.

44:49.982 --> 44:52.985
Not very becoming of the chief exorcist.

44:53.068 --> 44:56.613
Who do you want to be vanquished by today,
Jesus or his mother?

44:56.697 --> 44:57.990
Fuck the Holy Mother.

44:58.073 --> 45:01.285
Are we going to talk all night,
or do you want to battle?

45:02.160 --> 45:04.830
Know what I'm going to do
to you, Gabriele?

45:05.455 --> 45:06.832
I'm going to fuck you.

45:07.708 --> 45:09.793
You'll sense yourself coming.

45:10.419 --> 45:14.548
And you'll hate yourself
for the release you feel when I fuck you.

45:16.258 --> 45:17.259
And now we pray.

45:19.595 --> 45:23.891
I command you,
unclean spirit, whoever you are,

45:23.974 --> 45:28.478
along with all of your minions
now attacking the servant of God, Henry,

45:28.562 --> 45:30.522
by the mysteries of the incarnation...

45:30.606 --> 45:33.025
-Fuck you and your incarnations.
-...passion, resurrection

45:33.108 --> 45:37.362
and ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ,
by the descent of the Holy Spirit,

45:37.446 --> 45:41.491
by the coming of our Lord for judgment,
to tell me by some sign

45:41.575 --> 45:45.120
your name and the day
and hour of your departure.

45:45.204 --> 45:47.497
Tomás, pray. Pray.

45:47.581 --> 45:51.460
I command you,
moreover, to obey me to the letter,

45:51.543 --> 45:55.047
I who am a minister of God,
despite my unworthiness--

46:19.363 --> 46:20.531
Rosaria?

46:21.073 --> 46:23.408
Your sins will seek you out.

46:24.576 --> 46:26.578
My sins have been forgiven.

46:26.662 --> 46:30.582
But you can't forgive yourself,
can you, Father?

46:31.708 --> 46:35.879
Not for me, the girl you let die.

46:36.630 --> 46:38.590
Why did you do nothing?

46:39.299 --> 46:41.134
Why didn't you believe me?

46:41.718 --> 46:43.095
Now I am in hell.

46:43.929 --> 46:45.013
Deceiver.

46:45.097 --> 46:47.266
Her soul rests in peace.

46:47.349 --> 46:50.143
My soul rots in hell!

47:05.158 --> 47:06.785
How touching.

47:06.869 --> 47:08.120
Is that all you got?

47:08.203 --> 47:11.248
And how about you, panty sniffer?

47:12.833 --> 47:14.626
You didn't tell him, did you?

47:14.710 --> 47:17.212
About your little whore?

47:17.296 --> 47:20.716
Your little sweet treat, Adella.

47:21.425 --> 47:26.013
After you stood before your congregation
like you're better than them,

47:26.096 --> 47:28.182
when you're fucking their daughters.

47:28.807 --> 47:31.518
Maybe you aren't so sorry about that sin.

47:32.227 --> 47:33.061
Shut up.

47:33.145 --> 47:34.146
Tomás. Tomás.

47:34.229 --> 47:35.731
Do not speak to it.

47:35.814 --> 47:38.317
-Pray.
-Run away.

47:38.400 --> 47:41.028
You don't want to be here, Tomás.

47:41.111 --> 47:43.947
You'd rather be fucking that little whore.

47:45.532 --> 47:48.535
Tomás! Tomás!
No! No, no! That's what it wants!

47:57.002 --> 47:58.629
You've been played, Amorth.

47:59.880 --> 48:01.715
You took the bait.

48:02.674 --> 48:05.552
And I'll destroy you.

48:05.636 --> 48:09.515
Your holy Church
will crumble from the inside.

48:24.947 --> 48:27.574
The abbey's records, Your Holiness.

49:06.321 --> 49:08.115
She was the love of my life.

49:16.415 --> 49:18.584
A promise was made.

49:20.169 --> 49:21.753
She wanted me to...

49:22.921 --> 49:25.591
leave the priesthood for her...

49:26.675 --> 49:27.801
but I had...

49:29.052 --> 49:32.598
no intention of doing that.

49:33.640 --> 49:36.810
So I just told her what she wanted.

49:42.816 --> 49:44.026
My love for God...

49:46.403 --> 49:48.113
it outweighed my love for her.

49:49.031 --> 49:51.325
Are you sorry for your sins?

49:52.701 --> 49:53.535
Yes.

49:54.119 --> 49:56.538
May almighty God show you mercy.

49:56.622 --> 50:02.753
And having forgiven your sins,
may he lead you to eternal life.

50:04.546 --> 50:05.506
Amen.

50:08.300 --> 50:09.134
Amen.

50:15.557 --> 50:16.391
Who is...

50:18.101 --> 50:19.144
Rosaria?

50:22.940 --> 50:25.859
She is a girl that I should've helped.

50:25.943 --> 50:29.029
The demon
is using her memory to deceive me.

50:29.112 --> 50:30.822
How does it know these things?

50:30.906 --> 50:32.824
It can sense our guilt,

50:33.408 --> 50:37.496
and it uses it against us
as a distraction.

50:38.664 --> 50:42.209
That boy,
he does not have long before he expires.

50:43.001 --> 50:45.587
We need to find out
the name of this demon.

50:46.255 --> 50:48.423
Knowing its name, it weakens them.

50:49.341 --> 50:51.009
I didn't mean to hurt him.

50:51.093 --> 50:52.344
I understand.

50:53.387 --> 50:54.388
See here.

50:54.471 --> 50:56.265
I have marked this page for you.

50:56.807 --> 50:57.724
Learn that.

51:00.561 --> 51:02.563
But it is in Latin.

51:02.646 --> 51:04.648
Close enough to Spanish.

51:04.731 --> 51:06.733
Prayer has more power in Latin.

51:11.989 --> 51:14.199
"You have taken the bait."

51:15.742 --> 51:18.203
-What?
-What it said to me.

51:18.287 --> 51:20.539
"You have taken the bait, Amorth."

51:24.168 --> 51:26.086
This is not about the boy.

51:26.170 --> 51:27.588
It has a bigger plan.

51:27.671 --> 51:29.840
I need to check something
I saw in the garden.

51:30.465 --> 51:33.886
Go. Take this. Be outside his door.
He is still in danger.

51:33.969 --> 51:37.556
We must protect him at all cost.
Do whatever you have to.

51:54.281 --> 51:55.782
The seal of the Vatican.

51:56.658 --> 51:59.912
<i>This place
has given the Church problems before.</i>

53:01.932 --> 53:05.143
God, by your name...

53:07.062 --> 53:09.565
save me.

53:11.942 --> 53:12.901
Help me.

53:20.117 --> 53:20.951
Henry?

54:22.721 --> 54:23.555
Henry?

54:37.569 --> 54:40.906
No one's getting out of here alive!

54:43.408 --> 54:44.493
No one.

55:41.091 --> 55:43.552
Let's see what secrets you are hiding.

56:08.035 --> 56:09.244
What happened?

56:17.711 --> 56:18.545
Go!

56:33.268 --> 56:34.478
Help me!

56:34.561 --> 56:35.479
Amorth!

56:37.439 --> 56:38.607
Help me!

56:39.566 --> 56:41.026
Help!

56:41.109 --> 56:41.944
Amy!

56:43.320 --> 56:46.031
In the name of Christ, let her go.

56:46.114 --> 56:48.408
In the name of Christ, let her go.

56:49.159 --> 56:49.993
Amy!

56:50.827 --> 56:51.662
Help!

56:52.329 --> 56:55.123
In the name of Christ, let her go.

56:55.207 --> 56:56.542
It's me. It's me.

56:56.625 --> 56:58.293
Oh, my God. Oh, Amy.

56:58.377 --> 57:02.047
In the name of Christ,
go away, Satan, go away!

57:22.943 --> 57:24.361
It's one of her nails.

57:25.445 --> 57:27.739
Tomás, take them to the chapel.

57:41.962 --> 57:44.214
Everything is redacted.

57:47.885 --> 57:50.721
"Our sins will seek us out."

58:06.820 --> 58:08.447
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

58:08.947 --> 58:12.659
You don't get to stay handsome
in this business for too long.

58:12.743 --> 58:14.244
Please. Don't.

58:14.328 --> 58:19.249
I once have a demon
try to put a crucifix into my eyeball.

58:19.333 --> 58:21.126
You're always talking and talking. Enough.

58:21.210 --> 58:22.044
Please.

58:22.836 --> 58:24.254
They're sleeping.

58:24.338 --> 58:25.464
No more stories.

58:28.926 --> 58:32.387
Did you consider why the demon does this?

58:32.471 --> 58:33.347
To scare us?

58:33.847 --> 58:35.140
For what benefit?

58:35.724 --> 58:36.558
Chaos.

58:38.352 --> 58:39.520
Distraction.

58:39.603 --> 58:41.647
The devil is the great deceiver.

58:41.730 --> 58:43.815
He can make you see things from your past.

58:43.899 --> 58:47.736
Apparitions, memories,
always trying to deceive us.

58:47.819 --> 58:51.532
So we never know
what he's thinking, what he's planning.

58:52.824 --> 58:54.493
If you do not believe me...

58:55.410 --> 58:56.662
just ask my friend.

58:59.748 --> 59:02.042
Come, I'll show you what I found.

59:02.876 --> 59:03.836
Amorth!

59:04.336 --> 59:06.004
I noticed this when I first arrived.

59:12.219 --> 59:13.095
What is this?

59:14.012 --> 59:15.347
You recognize this?

59:16.265 --> 59:18.600
Yes, it's the seal
of the Spanish Inquisition.

59:19.142 --> 59:22.229
The darkest time
in the history of the Church.

59:23.188 --> 59:24.606
And they are...?

59:25.482 --> 59:28.443
The victims.
The ones who would not convert.

59:30.821 --> 59:32.781
There is something underneath this place.

59:33.365 --> 59:35.492
Something is hidden here. Come.

01:00:00.142 --> 01:00:01.018
Hold this.

01:00:10.277 --> 01:00:11.862
Two crossed keys.

01:00:12.446 --> 01:00:13.530
Do you recognize this?

01:00:14.156 --> 01:00:15.532
It's the Vatican seal.

01:00:18.076 --> 01:00:20.704
-Is it gas?
-A little gas.

01:00:20.787 --> 01:00:23.665
A little sulfur. A little death.

01:00:23.749 --> 01:00:27.044
So no smoking, huh? Stand back.

01:00:39.264 --> 01:00:40.933
It's a door. Push with me.

01:00:41.016 --> 01:00:41.850
Okay.

01:01:05.082 --> 01:01:06.041
Catacomb.

01:01:06.708 --> 01:01:08.919
This is how they would bury the dead.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:24.434
I understand the Vatican
sealing this place off.

01:01:26.562 --> 01:01:28.772
But why would they leave someone?

01:01:29.273 --> 01:01:32.025
The ring of the cardinal protector.

01:01:36.864 --> 01:01:40.409
He was the final hope, the last protector.

01:01:42.661 --> 01:01:46.540
It looks like he's a prisoner,
but he's not.

01:01:47.124 --> 01:01:50.335
The cage is for his own safety.

01:01:51.003 --> 01:01:57.843
They do this when an exorcism fails.
To protect against a demon's escape,

01:01:57.926 --> 01:02:01.305
to trap something
they need to remain hidden.

01:02:04.766 --> 01:02:07.811
Tomás, see if you can open this gate.

01:02:17.196 --> 01:02:22.492
"Your cardinal protector writes
to inform you of our worst fears.

01:02:22.576 --> 01:02:26.997
A great evil has taken hold
of San Sebastian Abbey.

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:29.875
It must be buried here forever."

01:02:32.836 --> 01:02:33.712
It's locked.

01:02:34.379 --> 01:02:35.839
Then our friend here...

01:02:36.965 --> 01:02:38.383
must have a key.

01:02:44.765 --> 01:02:46.725
Where did you hide your key?

01:02:51.063 --> 01:02:52.397
In the stomach.

01:02:56.527 --> 01:02:57.861
Forgive me.

01:03:15.003 --> 01:03:16.171
Try this.

01:03:19.049 --> 01:03:19.883
Go.

01:03:24.346 --> 01:03:27.224
"All attempts at exorcism have failed.

01:03:27.307 --> 01:03:30.727
Satan owns this ground now.

01:03:31.353 --> 01:03:38.193
I have never seen
a demon this powerful before."

01:03:49.872 --> 01:03:50.998
Gabriele.

01:03:51.081 --> 01:03:51.999
Gabriele.

01:04:00.465 --> 01:04:01.466
It worked.

01:04:04.887 --> 01:04:06.221
Thank you, my friend.

01:04:19.735 --> 01:04:20.569
Amy?

01:04:37.586 --> 01:04:40.005
The gases and the sulfur,
it's getting stronger.

01:04:42.758 --> 01:04:44.635
We are getting closer to hell.

01:05:01.151 --> 01:05:03.320
Cardinal Sullivan, is he all right?

01:05:03.403 --> 01:05:04.571
He collapsed.

01:05:04.655 --> 01:05:05.822
Holy Father.

01:05:08.951 --> 01:05:11.036
You are just agitated.

01:05:11.995 --> 01:05:12.829
Tell him.

01:05:12.913 --> 01:05:14.540
Tell who?

01:05:17.042 --> 01:05:18.293
Gabriele.

01:05:18.877 --> 01:05:19.795
Gabriele?

01:05:21.588 --> 01:05:22.548
Amorth?

01:05:25.259 --> 01:05:26.426
Amorth?

01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:29.096
What trouble has he got us into this time?

01:05:32.683 --> 01:05:34.726
The Friar De Ojada.

01:05:36.937 --> 01:05:39.565
One of the greatest exorcists of all time.

01:05:46.238 --> 01:05:47.865
The seal of the Spanish Inquisition.

01:05:55.706 --> 01:05:57.207
His journal.

01:05:57.291 --> 01:05:58.625
"Today...

01:05:59.501 --> 01:06:02.045
I was summoned to the town of Segovia."

01:06:02.129 --> 01:06:03.672
A possessed monk.

01:06:03.755 --> 01:06:06.592
"In the year of our Lord 1475.

01:06:08.218 --> 01:06:11.013
While questioning the demon
possessing the monk,

01:06:11.096 --> 01:06:13.724
he answered me from the mouth of another.

01:06:14.683 --> 01:06:16.185
And then a third."

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:18.729
Multiple possessions.

01:06:18.812 --> 01:06:20.314
It's a powerful demon.

01:06:39.499 --> 01:06:40.375
Amy?

01:06:55.432 --> 01:06:57.935
"The exorcist becomes possessed himself."

01:06:58.810 --> 01:06:59.937
Friar De Ojada?

01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:03.732
You know he is the man
who convinced Queen Isabella

01:07:03.815 --> 01:07:05.692
of the need for an Inquisition?

01:07:06.318 --> 01:07:10.364
So that means
from the time he is possessed in 1475,

01:07:10.447 --> 01:07:13.617
everything that happens after this...

01:07:14.618 --> 01:07:16.119
is the work of the devil.

01:07:17.621 --> 01:07:23.001
Centuries of persecution and torture,
the worst abuses of the Inquisition,

01:07:23.085 --> 01:07:26.505
all started by the friar
and done in the name of God

01:07:27.422 --> 01:07:28.757
by the devil.

01:07:30.342 --> 01:07:31.927
The Vatican must have known this.

01:07:32.636 --> 01:07:34.304
The Church covered it up.

01:07:34.388 --> 01:07:36.390
And they buried the truth here.

01:07:36.473 --> 01:07:39.393
"Your sins will seek you out."

01:07:39.476 --> 01:07:42.354
The construction work
must have freed the demon.

01:07:44.147 --> 01:07:45.148
Amy?

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.239
Amy?

01:07:56.743 --> 01:07:57.578
Henry.

01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:00.163
-It's okay, Mommy.
-It's okay, Mommy.

01:08:00.747 --> 01:08:02.332
-Henry's okay.
-Henry's okay.

01:08:02.416 --> 01:08:03.876
Oh, that's great.

01:08:05.252 --> 01:08:07.212
Amy,
why don't you come downstairs with me?

01:08:07.296 --> 01:08:08.922
-I'm sorry, Mom.
-I'm sorry, Mom.

01:08:09.006 --> 01:08:11.675
-I don't know what got into me.
-I don't know what got into me.

01:08:12.801 --> 01:08:14.219
Well, that's okay.

01:08:15.304 --> 01:08:18.432
That's okay.
I just need your sister for a minute. Amy?

01:08:18.515 --> 01:08:20.392
-Can you forgive me?
-Can you forgive me?

01:08:31.737 --> 01:08:34.823
"The great dragon was hurled down.

01:08:34.907 --> 01:08:38.618
Hurled into the earth,
where he was bound."

01:08:38.702 --> 01:08:41.872
"And his angels with him." Revelations.

01:08:42.788 --> 01:08:46.417
Two hundred rogue angels
buried into the earth.

01:08:46.502 --> 01:08:49.962
This abbey
is one of those godforsaken places.

01:08:50.046 --> 01:08:52.466
This demon, he was trying to find them.

01:08:52.549 --> 01:08:56.261
To raise an army and destroy the Church.

01:08:56.345 --> 01:08:57.638
Amy, come here.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.890
-What's in your hand?
-What's in your hand?

01:09:00.807 --> 01:09:02.017
Amy, come here, right now.

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:04.978
-What's in your hand, Mommy?
-What's in your hand, Mommy?

01:09:23.830 --> 01:09:24.957
Look.

01:09:28.292 --> 01:09:29.545
Watch me, Mommy.

01:09:29.627 --> 01:09:30.754
Watch me.

01:09:45.352 --> 01:09:46.435
His name...

01:09:48.354 --> 01:09:49.773
...the king of hell...

01:09:50.941 --> 01:09:52.149
Asmodeus.

01:10:02.244 --> 01:10:03.245
Quickly!

01:10:07.916 --> 01:10:09.501
Amy, use the sedative.

01:10:18.343 --> 01:10:19.928
Tie his arms.

01:10:29.396 --> 01:10:30.731
We have his name.

01:10:39.781 --> 01:10:41.241
"Bring me the priest."

01:10:42.576 --> 01:10:43.827
What did you say?

01:10:43.911 --> 01:10:47.789
Those were the first words the demon said.
"Bring me the priest."

01:10:49.208 --> 01:10:50.584
It didn't mean me.

01:10:51.168 --> 01:10:52.544
It wants you.

01:10:52.628 --> 01:10:55.005
This demon feeds on exorcists.

01:10:55.672 --> 01:10:57.341
He had a plan once.

01:10:58.634 --> 01:11:00.469
To lure the friar here,

01:11:01.303 --> 01:11:03.764
hide amongst the righteous
and commit heinous acts

01:11:03.847 --> 01:11:05.265
in the name of God.

01:11:05.349 --> 01:11:07.559
He wants to do the same thing again.

01:11:07.643 --> 01:11:10.395
Using me to infiltrate the Church.

01:11:10.479 --> 01:11:12.689
What greater victory for the devil...

01:11:14.483 --> 01:11:17.694
than to claim the soul
of the pope's exorcist?

01:11:17.778 --> 01:11:20.572
Maybe. But we know his name now.

01:11:21.782 --> 01:11:23.992
So we have what we need to beat it

01:11:24.785 --> 01:11:26.453
and to save the child.

01:11:27.412 --> 01:11:30.541
The only thing
that can defeat us is ourselves.

01:11:33.585 --> 01:11:35.838
He will use your sins against you.

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:41.552
I need to make confession.

01:11:42.219 --> 01:11:45.097
-To me?
-You are a priest, are you not?

01:11:47.683 --> 01:11:50.102
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

01:11:51.186 --> 01:11:52.437
Trust in the Lord.

01:11:55.816 --> 01:11:57.276
I want to talk to you...

01:11:58.986 --> 01:12:01.405
about things I have confessed before...

01:12:02.781 --> 01:12:04.408
but they still burden me.

01:12:05.576 --> 01:12:07.202
In 1942...

01:12:08.537 --> 01:12:10.622
during the war, I joined the Resistance.

01:12:10.706 --> 01:12:13.333
I became a partisan
and I fought against the fascists.

01:12:16.003 --> 01:12:18.922
<i>So many of my friends
would die to German bullets.</i>

01:12:21.842 --> 01:12:22.926
<i>Why them...</i>

01:12:24.136 --> 01:12:25.554
and not me?

01:12:27.264 --> 01:12:30.100
<i>Their dead bodies
would talk to me in my dreams.</i>

01:12:31.476 --> 01:12:33.937
<i>To die in a war is heroic.</i>

01:12:34.771 --> 01:12:36.190
To survive a war...

01:12:37.608 --> 01:12:38.650
complex.

01:12:42.696 --> 01:12:43.906
<i>And then I begin to see...</i>

01:12:44.781 --> 01:12:46.533
<i>that my life had been spared.</i>

01:12:46.617 --> 01:12:49.203
<i>It was my responsibility
to give it purpose.</i>

01:12:49.286 --> 01:12:51.997
<i>And in my case, that meant to serve God.</i>

01:12:54.833 --> 01:12:59.129
In all of my years, I have tried
to embrace what is said in Matthew.

01:12:59.796 --> 01:13:04.510
<i>"What you do
for the least among you, you do for me."</i>

01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:07.221
But when it mattered...

01:13:08.931 --> 01:13:10.182
I failed.

01:13:16.021 --> 01:13:17.189
<i>I did not help her,</i>

01:13:17.272 --> 01:13:18.690
<i>I did not believe her.</i>

01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:20.817
<i>I did not listen.</i>

01:13:21.693 --> 01:13:22.528
Rosaria?

01:13:23.946 --> 01:13:25.030
Rosaria.

01:13:25.656 --> 01:13:28.742
At night, the devil fucks me.

01:13:29.326 --> 01:13:31.870
What does this devil look like?

01:13:33.956 --> 01:13:34.790
You.

01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:46.301
She was not possessed.

01:13:47.344 --> 01:13:49.221
She was mentally disturbed.

01:13:49.972 --> 01:13:54.226
<i>So I let someone else handle her case.</i>

01:13:55.269 --> 01:13:56.103
Again...

01:13:57.771 --> 01:13:59.147
my pride.

01:13:59.231 --> 01:14:00.899
I was an exorcist.

01:14:00.983 --> 01:14:03.694
The mentally disturbed, it's not my job.

01:14:05.112 --> 01:14:06.947
Do you believe me now?

01:14:07.698 --> 01:14:10.242
<i>But that all changed because of her.</i>

01:14:17.666 --> 01:14:18.625
To hear

01:14:19.585 --> 01:14:21.086
after her death

01:14:21.795 --> 01:14:25.090
the rumors of the sexual abuse,
the coverup

01:14:25.174 --> 01:14:27.634
within the walls of the Vatican City.

01:14:29.094 --> 01:14:30.554
<i>That innocent girl.</i>

01:14:32.431 --> 01:14:35.601
I did not help her when she needed me.

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:39.688
Her soul

01:14:40.606 --> 01:14:41.940
is my burden.

01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:45.444
And this demon, he knows that.

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:51.491
I know you...

01:14:52.868 --> 01:14:56.914
as a humble man of God, Father Amorth.

01:14:57.748 --> 01:15:00.209
It's time to lay down that burden.

01:15:01.168 --> 01:15:02.586
Forgive me, Father.

01:15:05.047 --> 01:15:07.216
I absolve you of your sins

01:15:07.299 --> 01:15:11.595
in the name of the Father,
of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

01:15:13.055 --> 01:15:13.889
Amen.

01:15:46.463 --> 01:15:49.508
I give you the miraculous medal.

01:15:50.133 --> 01:15:52.010
Holy fire insurance.

01:15:52.094 --> 01:15:53.178
Very powerful.

01:15:55.681 --> 01:15:57.391
To defeat the king of hell...

01:15:58.475 --> 01:16:00.352
we require the armor of God.

01:16:04.022 --> 01:16:05.649
To defeat the king of hell...

01:16:06.733 --> 01:16:08.527
we require the armor of God.

01:16:25.627 --> 01:16:29.840
Remember,
the demon will use your sins against you.

01:16:31.008 --> 01:16:34.970
Do not believe everything you see or hear.

01:16:36.722 --> 01:16:38.056
We have work to do.

01:16:39.933 --> 01:16:41.643
We must save this child.

01:17:16.053 --> 01:17:17.721
All done confessing?

01:17:18.305 --> 01:17:19.306
Father.

01:17:19.389 --> 01:17:22.935
Did he bare his soul to you, Tomás?

01:17:23.018 --> 01:17:26.063
Like your little whore bared her breasts?

01:17:27.689 --> 01:17:28.524
Ignore it.

01:17:29.066 --> 01:17:30.234
Pray for Henry.

01:17:30.317 --> 01:17:32.903
No amount of prayers can save Henry.

01:17:33.570 --> 01:17:35.697
Let me in, Gabriele.

01:17:35.781 --> 01:17:37.658
You know what I want.

01:17:39.326 --> 01:17:41.286
Our Father, who art in heaven,

01:17:41.370 --> 01:17:43.747
-In heaven, hallowed be thy name.
-hallowed be thy name.

01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:46.124
-Thy kingdom come, thy...
-Was there really any point

01:17:46.208 --> 01:17:48.961
confessing to your god, Gabe?

01:17:49.044 --> 01:17:53.799
-Give us this day our...
-Shouldn't you be confessing to her?

01:18:03.016 --> 01:18:05.686
You are not there.

01:18:05.769 --> 01:18:07.896
You are only in my mind.

01:18:09.731 --> 01:18:12.359
I burn in hell because of you!

01:18:12.442 --> 01:18:13.944
You are not there.

01:18:15.279 --> 01:18:17.364
You are only in my mind.

01:18:20.617 --> 01:18:23.412
-Father.
-Join us in hell, Gabe.

01:18:23.495 --> 01:18:24.538
Take me in.

01:18:24.621 --> 01:18:26.415
Don't you want me, Tomás?

01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:31.211
Tell me to get on my knees
and say my prayers.

01:18:31.295 --> 01:18:32.713
Fuck me, Tomás.

01:18:33.547 --> 01:18:36.175
-Deceiver.
-Fuck me, Tomás!

01:18:36.258 --> 01:18:37.843
-Deceiver!
-Fuck me, priest.

01:18:37.926 --> 01:18:40.345
-Oh, God.
-Tomás, focus on the prayer!

01:18:40.429 --> 01:18:41.430
Asmodeus!

01:18:42.556 --> 01:18:46.602
Asmodeus, king of Gehemma,
this is the cross of the Lord!

01:18:46.685 --> 01:18:50.022
Release this child
and flee from the light of God!

01:18:51.315 --> 01:18:52.774
See thee beneath God!

01:18:52.858 --> 01:18:54.359
Never. Get out.

01:18:54.443 --> 01:18:56.653
-Get out of my house.
-This is the house of God!

01:18:56.737 --> 01:18:58.030
Not without my son!

01:18:58.113 --> 01:18:59.323
Your son is gone.

01:18:59.406 --> 01:19:01.366
His soul burns and rots in hell.

01:19:01.450 --> 01:19:03.869
-Admit to thy name, Asmodeus.
-Never!

01:19:03.952 --> 01:19:06.205
And bow to the power of God almighty.

01:19:06.288 --> 01:19:08.290
-Take me in, Gabe.
-Oh, Mary...

01:19:09.416 --> 01:19:12.085
-...Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou...
-And of the angels...

01:19:12.169 --> 01:19:13.462
I am king.

01:19:13.545 --> 01:19:15.255
You're under my dominion.

01:19:15.339 --> 01:19:19.635
-We humbly beseech you...
-And here you will remain damned forever!

01:19:19.718 --> 01:19:21.512
...now and at the hour of our death.

01:19:21.595 --> 01:19:23.180
...to crush Satan's skull.

01:19:23.263 --> 01:19:26.350
I am Asmodeus, king of hell.

01:19:26.433 --> 01:19:28.769
And I command you!

01:19:28.852 --> 01:19:34.066
We beseech thee to send thy holy angels,
that under thy command and by thy power,

01:19:34.650 --> 01:19:38.820
they may pursue the evil spirits,
encounter them on every side,

01:19:38.904 --> 01:19:40.072
resist their bold attacks,

01:19:40.864 --> 01:19:43.617
and drive them hence
into the abyss of woe!

01:19:59.716 --> 01:20:00.717
Mommy?

01:20:03.136 --> 01:20:05.639
Mom, help me.

01:20:06.431 --> 01:20:08.433
Speak to him, Julia. Speak to him.

01:20:08.517 --> 01:20:10.018
A mother's love never fails.

01:20:10.102 --> 01:20:12.354
Henry. Henry, I love you.

01:20:12.437 --> 01:20:14.648
-Call to him.
-Henry, come back to me.

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:17.276
Henry, please talk to me.

01:20:21.196 --> 01:20:23.949
Mommy, they're hurting me.

01:20:24.032 --> 01:20:24.950
Oh, God.

01:20:25.033 --> 01:20:26.785
Henry, we need your help.

01:20:27.369 --> 01:20:28.787
You must resist.

01:20:28.871 --> 01:20:30.080
I can't.

01:20:30.163 --> 01:20:31.498
You must resist!

01:20:33.625 --> 01:20:34.585
Mom?

01:20:38.130 --> 01:20:39.131
Henry.

01:20:52.769 --> 01:20:53.812
What's happening?

01:20:59.026 --> 01:21:00.235
Oh, my God.

01:21:00.319 --> 01:21:01.570
Holy shit.

01:21:02.487 --> 01:21:03.989
Almighty God.

01:21:10.954 --> 01:21:12.206
It's in them both.

01:21:22.341 --> 01:21:23.550
Amy.

01:21:49.409 --> 01:21:51.662
-Give me what I want!
-No!

01:21:54.498 --> 01:21:56.250
Surrender yourself to me.

01:22:07.553 --> 01:22:08.679
Julia!

01:22:25.153 --> 01:22:27.072
I told you, bitch.

01:22:27.155 --> 01:22:28.699
You're all gonna die!

01:22:28.782 --> 01:22:31.034
-Amy, please.
-Amy's gone.

01:22:32.077 --> 01:22:34.413
Julia, resist!

01:22:34.496 --> 01:22:35.706
Don't lose faith!

01:22:35.789 --> 01:22:38.000
Give me back my children!

01:22:38.083 --> 01:22:39.835
Your children are gone!

01:22:41.086 --> 01:22:42.254
Please.

01:22:42.337 --> 01:22:43.547
Amy, please.

01:22:43.630 --> 01:22:44.965
I love you.

01:22:55.058 --> 01:22:57.519
It's me you want. Let the children go.

01:22:57.603 --> 01:22:59.438
They all suffer because of you.

01:22:59.521 --> 01:23:01.773
Say the words, piggy.

01:23:05.736 --> 01:23:08.530
Be the martyr you dreamed of being.

01:23:09.156 --> 01:23:11.366
Be my piggy.

01:23:11.450 --> 01:23:12.743
Take me.

01:23:27.591 --> 01:23:28.634
Mom?

01:23:31.053 --> 01:23:33.430
No, Gabriele!

01:23:51.365 --> 01:23:52.199
Father.

01:24:00.249 --> 01:24:01.124
Mommy?

01:24:02.167 --> 01:24:03.460
What have you done?

01:24:03.544 --> 01:24:05.629
-Take the cross from my hand.
-Okay.

01:24:05.712 --> 01:24:06.588
-Take it.
-Okay.

01:24:06.672 --> 01:24:08.799
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:24:08.882 --> 01:24:11.426
Oh, my God. Henry, you came back to me.

01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:12.719
-You're safe now.
-Take it!

01:24:14.513 --> 01:24:16.056
Get them out of here. Go!

01:24:16.139 --> 01:24:17.391
Hey. Hey.

01:24:17.474 --> 01:24:18.809
Julia, we have to go!

01:24:18.892 --> 01:24:20.394
-Put your arms around me.
-Let's go.

01:24:20.477 --> 01:24:22.437
Come on, run. Amy, come on.

01:24:27.359 --> 01:24:29.194
<i>Your soul is mine.</i>

01:24:39.371 --> 01:24:40.956
<i>Sullivan.</i>

01:24:41.874 --> 01:24:42.791
<i>Sullivan!</i>

01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:08.525
<i>I knew you would sacrifice yourself
to save those children,</i>

01:25:08.609 --> 01:25:10.444
<i>and now you are mine.</i>

01:25:19.536 --> 01:25:21.079
Come on. Hurry.

01:25:23.707 --> 01:25:26.251
The boy, he's safe now.
Just get away from here.

01:25:29.796 --> 01:25:31.298
-Go.
-Thank you, Father.

01:25:39.014 --> 01:25:40.516
<i>I need my pig, Gabe.</i>

01:25:49.066 --> 01:25:51.735
You will not take me.

01:25:51.818 --> 01:25:54.321
You will not take me!

01:25:55.072 --> 01:25:56.865
<i>You prideful fool.</i>

01:25:56.949 --> 01:25:59.034
<i>The friar said the exact same thing.</i>

01:26:00.202 --> 01:26:01.620
Forgive me, Lord.

01:26:04.957 --> 01:26:05.958
<i>Not yet!</i>

01:26:06.041 --> 01:26:09.419
<i>I need my pig
to get me inside the Vatican, Gabe.</i>

01:27:05.142 --> 01:27:06.393
Gabriele!

01:27:16.862 --> 01:27:18.697
Damn us both...

01:27:19.364 --> 01:27:20.991
to hell.

01:27:56.235 --> 01:27:57.361
Gabriele!

01:28:00.656 --> 01:28:01.698
Gabriele!

01:28:30.102 --> 01:28:32.271
You're too late, Tomás.

01:28:32.938 --> 01:28:36.108
He's gone, your friend. Gone.

01:28:36.692 --> 01:28:37.860
So...

01:28:40.237 --> 01:28:41.113
run along.

01:28:42.739 --> 01:28:44.700
It would be my great pleasure

01:28:44.783 --> 01:28:49.746
to excoriate your soul
and eviscerate your memory.

01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:53.125
Gabriele, listen to me. Fight it.

01:28:53.208 --> 01:28:55.210
It is just in your head.

01:28:55.294 --> 01:28:57.296
We can only be defeated by ourselves.

01:28:58.088 --> 01:28:59.631
He is not here!

01:28:59.715 --> 01:29:03.844
The little piggy is slopping
at hell's trough, where he belongs.

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:07.681
I know you're here, Gabriele.
Pray with me.

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:13.437
God is not here!

01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:15.731
God is always in our hearts.

01:29:15.814 --> 01:29:17.065
Focus on the prayer.

01:29:18.525 --> 01:29:19.902
"Where two of you gather...

01:29:20.903 --> 01:29:23.322
in my name, there am I."

01:29:24.114 --> 01:29:26.158
Lord, have mercy.

01:29:26.241 --> 01:29:29.077
Say it! Lord, have mercy!

01:29:33.081 --> 01:29:35.876
God is with you, Gabriele. Find him!

01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:37.836
Finish it, Tomás.

01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:39.129
Finish it!

01:29:39.213 --> 01:29:43.717
God, by your name, save me.

01:29:44.343 --> 01:29:48.597
Judge me in thy strength.

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:51.725
O God, hear my prayer.

01:29:51.808 --> 01:29:54.853
Listen to the words of my mouth.

01:29:54.937 --> 01:29:58.398
Behold, God is my helper.

01:29:59.149 --> 01:30:00.776
Give up. He is mine.

01:30:00.859 --> 01:30:05.447
I adjure you
in the name of the spotless lamb.

01:30:05.531 --> 01:30:08.033
The word made flesh commands you.

01:30:08.116 --> 01:30:09.576
Asmodeus!

01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:12.579
Jesus of Nazareth commands you!

01:30:12.663 --> 01:30:17.793
And now, I adjure you in his name!

01:30:19.169 --> 01:30:21.797
Lord, heed my prayer!

01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:24.216
-Say it!
-No!

01:30:27.386 --> 01:30:29.680
-Gabriele.
<i>-We're not done yet.</i>

01:30:35.602 --> 01:30:38.230
<i>You're coming to hell, priests.</i>

01:30:38.981 --> 01:30:41.358
<i>I will take you both.</i>

01:30:45.904 --> 01:30:46.989
Adella.

01:31:11.138 --> 01:31:13.265
Your sins will seek...

01:31:13.348 --> 01:31:14.641
Seek you out!

01:31:14.725 --> 01:31:16.518
Tomás, use the medal!

01:31:16.602 --> 01:31:19.021
Lord, grant me the power!

01:31:29.406 --> 01:31:30.365
Gabriele!

01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:35.579
Asmodeus. In the name of the Holy Mother.

01:31:35.662 --> 01:31:39.041
See thee beneath God.

01:31:40.417 --> 01:31:42.753
See thee beneath God!

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:47.132
Tomás! Pray the final rites.

01:31:48.592 --> 01:31:54.306
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit...

01:31:55.307 --> 01:31:57.226
see thee beneath God!

01:32:18.956 --> 01:32:21.542
Gabriele, are you okay?

01:32:27.422 --> 01:32:28.465
Not so bad.

01:32:33.303 --> 01:32:35.013
-Tomás.
-What?

01:32:36.557 --> 01:32:37.975
You look like shit.

01:32:41.979 --> 01:32:43.480
Bless you, Tomás.

01:32:44.439 --> 01:32:46.066
You learned the Latin.

01:32:47.943 --> 01:32:50.654
Yes, it's similar to the Spanish.

01:32:50.737 --> 01:32:53.407
Very similar to the Spanish.

01:32:57.494 --> 01:32:58.579
Look.

01:33:03.083 --> 01:33:08.380
You know, the God,
he works in very mysterious ways.

01:33:14.219 --> 01:33:15.053
For you.

01:33:23.645 --> 01:33:26.315
Yes, he does.

01:33:35.157 --> 01:33:35.991
Cuckoo.

01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:46.251
Is that you, Gabriele?

01:33:46.835 --> 01:33:47.961
Yes, Your Holiness.

01:33:48.879 --> 01:33:50.881
And I have brought Padre Esquibel
to meet you.

01:33:51.673 --> 01:33:53.550
You look well, Your Holiness.

01:33:53.634 --> 01:33:56.220
Thanks to you both. I'm glad to see you.

01:33:57.012 --> 01:33:58.805
You had me worried this time.

01:33:59.473 --> 01:34:01.016
Sounded dangerous.

01:34:01.099 --> 01:34:02.893
Yeah, not too bad.

01:34:03.936 --> 01:34:06.563
Sometimes you fly
a little too close to the sun.

01:34:07.648 --> 01:34:09.233
It has not killed me yet.

01:34:09.316 --> 01:34:11.527
The Church will not forget
what you have done.

01:34:11.610 --> 01:34:15.405
You struck a mighty blow for our side.

01:34:15.489 --> 01:34:18.116
Saint Michael would be proud.

01:34:19.076 --> 01:34:22.287
And this is why God
put you here, Gabriele.

01:34:22.371 --> 01:34:23.914
Thank you very much, Your Holiness.

01:34:24.456 --> 01:34:29.002
And God has made a good choice
in you too, Father Esquibel.

01:34:29.086 --> 01:34:30.420
Thank you, Holy Father.

01:34:30.504 --> 01:34:35.884
The congregation
has requested a full report on Spain.

01:34:35.968 --> 01:34:37.344
A full report.

01:34:37.427 --> 01:34:42.182
So Cardinal Sullivan can tell me again
that evil only exists in my imagination?

01:34:42.266 --> 01:34:43.183
You haven't heard?

01:34:43.851 --> 01:34:47.855
Cardinal Sullivan has taken a sabbatical
in the Isle of Guam.

01:34:51.149 --> 01:34:54.069
I shall pray for Guam.

01:34:56.488 --> 01:34:59.908
And who has filled his shoes?

01:34:59.992 --> 01:35:03.829
I have found someone far more trustworthy.

01:35:05.122 --> 01:35:07.583
I will leave you in his good hands.

01:35:12.129 --> 01:35:15.132
See thee beneath God.

01:35:15.215 --> 01:35:17.092
-See thee beneath God.
-See thee beneath God.

01:35:22.014 --> 01:35:24.725
Welcome to the holiest of holies.

01:35:24.808 --> 01:35:26.518
Twelve centuries of treasures.

01:35:27.102 --> 01:35:29.605
Letters from saints and apostles.

01:35:29.688 --> 01:35:32.357
Books of wisdom and piety.

01:35:32.441 --> 01:35:34.276
Revelations of the spirit.

01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:38.405
The entire canon of Christian thought.

01:35:39.573 --> 01:35:42.201
The Vatican has purchased the abbey
from the Vasquez family

01:35:42.284 --> 01:35:44.286
and reconsecrated the soil.

01:35:44.369 --> 01:35:47.539
The family has safely relocated
back to the U.S.,

01:35:47.664 --> 01:35:49.833
where the boy made a full recovery.

01:35:54.046 --> 01:35:58.467
The friar's diary is proving very useful,
despite his abhorrence.

01:35:58.550 --> 01:36:02.888
Asmodeus has been defeated,
but there are many more to be found.

01:36:02.971 --> 01:36:08.519
Soon we will know
all of the other 199 sites on earth

01:36:08.602 --> 01:36:10.562
where God is not welcome.

01:36:11.230 --> 01:36:14.316
Gabriele, will you take on this task?

01:36:16.777 --> 01:36:21.073
This would be more
than a lifetime's work for one priest.

01:36:22.324 --> 01:36:23.659
But two priests...

01:36:25.536 --> 01:36:28.580
What do you think, Tomás?
Can you see this now as a calling?

01:36:29.206 --> 01:36:33.210
And that we must serve God
the way he wants us to serve him?

01:36:35.879 --> 01:36:37.297
Let's go to work.

01:36:40.133 --> 01:36:41.677
Let's go to hell.
