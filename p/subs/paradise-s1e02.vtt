00:02.585 --> 00:04.878
Xavier, will you ever
be able to forgive me

00:04.879 --> 00:06.506
for what happened?

00:07.966 --> 00:09.925
<i>I got the gig for another four years</i>

00:09.926 --> 00:12.136
<i>until I get to retire somewhere beautiful.</i>

00:12.137 --> 00:15.181
Unless, of course,
somebody shoots me first.

00:16.182 --> 00:17.891
Wildcat is down.

00:17.892 --> 00:19.269
It's a code red.

00:19.769 --> 00:20.978
<i>Someone had to know a lot.</i>

00:20.979 --> 00:22.522
<i>Someone had to have a lot of access.</i>

00:23.106 --> 00:24.940
I was wondering where you were,
Agent Robinson.

00:24.941 --> 00:27.609
Oh, I'm right here, Agent Collins.

00:27.610 --> 00:29.695
<i>The First Lady
who will take the kid</i>

00:29.696 --> 00:32.614
and leave me the second I'm out of office.

00:32.615 --> 00:34.199
I know, you're not wrong, Xavier.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.827
What's in here will definitely kill me.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.622
<i>Agent Collins,
you're about to be entrusted</i>

00:40.623 --> 00:42.166
with top-secret information.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.417
It's a fancy way of saying

00:43.418 --> 00:45.127
that's the most important
box in the world.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.796
We are preparing
for a massive catastrophe

00:47.797 --> 00:49.882
that could cause an extinction level
event for humanity

00:49.883 --> 00:51.508
<i>in the very real future.</i>

01:18.953 --> 01:20.246
Hi, everyone.

01:21.456 --> 01:22.874
Thank you for joining me here.

01:24.584 --> 01:26.752
Thank you for signing the various NDAs.

01:26.753 --> 01:29.254
I know it's all been
a bit cloak and dagger,

01:29.255 --> 01:31.840
and for that, I apologize.

01:31.841 --> 01:33.550
Also for the shitty coffee.

01:36.971 --> 01:38.305
I know some of you have traveled in

01:38.306 --> 01:39.848
from all over the country,

01:39.849 --> 01:42.226
and I know you've been asked

01:42.227 --> 01:45.021
not to exchange pleasantries
or introductions.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.315
I know it's weird.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.235
The people in this room

01:51.236 --> 01:53.320
are some of the country's preeminent minds

01:53.321 --> 01:55.531
in multiple fields.

01:55.532 --> 01:58.701
If you're in this room,
it's because you're extremely special.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.287
And you're about to be entrusted
with something massive.

02:05.542 --> 02:06.876
If you'll follow me.

02:34.362 --> 02:36.197
My husband's a terrible flyer.

02:38.408 --> 02:41.119
I met him at a bar almost 10 years ago.

02:41.619 --> 02:42.619
Totally random.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.414
Love at first sight type of thing.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.958
If I had known he was
such a wimp in the air,

02:47.959 --> 02:50.002
I might not have given him a chance.

02:51.754 --> 02:56.049
If it makes you feel any better,
this plane cost me $250 million.

02:56.050 --> 02:58.845
I didn't spend 250 mil
on a plane so it could crash.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.347
And nobody ever does.

03:06.477 --> 03:08.061
So, you're the guy who builds cities?

03:09.731 --> 03:12.357
I'm the founder of an architecture
and urban planning firm,

03:12.358 --> 03:14.109
expressing a new architectural language

03:14.110 --> 03:16.696
focused on the needs
of self-sustaining communities.

03:19.073 --> 03:20.617
Can I toss a hypothetical at you?

03:21.576 --> 03:22.577
It's your plane.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.211
If I gave you unlimited resources,

03:32.212 --> 03:34.504
resources gathered by a few friends

03:34.505 --> 03:38.885
and business acquaintances,
in my situation,

03:40.220 --> 03:43.305
if I told you to design me
an underground city,

03:43.306 --> 03:44.973
something that could
safely weather anything

03:44.974 --> 03:47.894
from a nuclear blast
to environmental catastrophe,

03:48.561 --> 03:50.604
if I told you I wanted you to make it feel

03:50.605 --> 03:52.232
like Anywhere, USA,

03:53.274 --> 03:54.983
a city for 25,000 people

03:54.984 --> 03:57.527
that felt like any city up here,
a city with cars,

03:57.528 --> 04:00.657
and cell phones, and trees,
what would you say?

04:01.658 --> 04:03.701
Well, first, I'd, uh, laugh.

04:05.411 --> 04:06.411
Okay, and then?

04:06.412 --> 04:09.289
Well, then I'd-- I'd laugh again.

04:09.290 --> 04:11.917
Then, I'd-- I'd tell you it's impossible.

04:11.918 --> 04:15.630
You know, I mean,
25,000 people...

04:16.923 --> 04:19.800
I mean, you-you-
you'd have to have a space

04:19.801 --> 04:23.220
the size of, like, uh, Toledo.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.721
So, there's no amount of money

04:24.722 --> 04:26.682
that would allow you
to excavate a space so large

04:26.683 --> 04:29.017
that an underground space
would actually feel like...

04:29.018 --> 04:32.021
well, like Toledo. It's not possible.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.150
Of course.

04:38.236 --> 04:39.612
This is what I've been told.

04:43.199 --> 04:45.451
If you have to tinkle, now's the time.

04:46.577 --> 04:47.953
We'll be landing shortly.

07:02.296 --> 07:04.172
Build me my city.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.645
I know, me again.

08:41.646 --> 08:43.313
It didn't work at the grocery store again.

08:43.314 --> 08:44.773
I get it.
We can take care of that.

09:46.335 --> 09:47.794
I've got white wine.

09:47.795 --> 09:49.254
I can give you a straw if you want.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.089
- You can blow bubbles in it.
-  No, thank you.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.507
- White wine is fine.
-  Ah.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.384
No straw. Thank you.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.556
Celebrating?

10:00.725 --> 10:01.892
Something like that.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.479
Mysterious. That's cool.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.692
Thank you.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.028
- Yeah. Thanks.
-  Okay.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.905
I just sold my startup.

10:15.906 --> 10:17.867
Oh yeah? Congrats.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.870
- You're not impressed?
- We're in San Francisco.

10:21.871 --> 10:24.665
Half this bar probably
just sold their startups.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.876
It's a cloud storage startup. Demesne?

10:27.877 --> 10:29.544
- Oh.
- You've probably read about it.

10:29.545 --> 10:31.171
Nah, I'm more of an analog guy.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.797
But good for you. Sounds like a big deal.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.925
Yeah, well, if the...

10:36.510 --> 10:38.678
stock moves the way I think it will,

10:38.679 --> 10:41.057
next year, this time, I'll be worth...

10:43.643 --> 10:45.811
$14 billion.

10:49.106 --> 10:53.401
I just became the richest
self-made woman in the world.

10:55.571 --> 10:57.238
Sorry, I don't know why I told you that.

10:57.239 --> 10:59.908
I think I just kind of needed
to say it out-- out loud.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.243
No, I get it.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.329
Yeah, I...

11:05.414 --> 11:09.167
Actually, I'm celebrating too.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.462
- You are?
- Yeah.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.965
My softball team won
the championship tonight.

11:17.593 --> 11:18.844
Whoa!

11:19.887 --> 11:21.221
It's fast-pitch softball.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.223
Well, I'm actually gonna be worth

11:23.224 --> 11:25.475
34 billion, not 14 billion.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.061
I don't know why I lied.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.480
It was slow-pitch softball.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.901
I lied because I was hoping
you'd wanna have sex with me.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.779

13:32.186 --> 13:33.686
I'm gonna need you to come with me.

13:36.941 --> 13:39.108
Go on.

13:39.109 --> 13:40.610
I came to help the kids get to school,

13:40.611 --> 13:42.862
and I had Pres pack the lunches

13:42.863 --> 13:45.783
so they'll have nutrients, or whatever.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.578
Nothing to worry about, gang.

13:50.579 --> 13:53.082

14:11.350 --> 14:12.852

14:13.519 --> 14:14.645

14:15.187 --> 14:17.189
they're in an absolute fucking frenzy.

14:17.606 --> 14:18.774
So...

14:20.734 --> 14:22.194
do you have a suspect?

14:29.952 --> 14:31.537
Have you found the murder weapon?

14:36.667 --> 14:38.752
Did you collect any samples for DNA?

14:40.462 --> 14:42.589
Agent Robinson,
do you have any matches on DNA?

14:42.590 --> 14:44.884
Jesus, Collins. No.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.052
No prime suspects.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.222
Dad and the ex-wife alibied out.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.724
No weapon.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.517
Brooks and Rainey
are digging through the trash

14:54.518 --> 14:55.603
and they're pissy about it.

14:56.604 --> 14:57.897
Autopsy's tomorrow.

14:58.480 --> 15:02.318
And yes, of course, we ran the DNA.

15:03.527 --> 15:05.862
Unfortunately, our resources
down here are limited,

15:05.863 --> 15:08.990
considering that the DNA tech
basically exists to make sure

15:08.991 --> 15:11.327
people don't start marrying
their cousins in 100 years.

15:16.582 --> 15:17.875
You got something to say?

15:19.168 --> 15:20.169
Say it.

15:22.171 --> 15:24.297
I just don't understand
why of all the people

15:24.298 --> 15:26.466
that could be heading this up,
they chose the one person

15:26.467 --> 15:28.594
who was sleeping with the victim.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.474
I'm clean, Xavier.

15:34.558 --> 15:35.892
The camera feed was down

15:35.893 --> 15:38.937
from 10:42 until 12:13 that night

15:38.938 --> 15:41.105
while your boy was asleep on the couch.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.776
And from 10:42 until 12:13 that night,

15:44.693 --> 15:47.613
I was at the tavern
having drinks with some friends.

15:48.572 --> 15:51.240
The other reason, and this could just
be me spit-balling,

15:51.241 --> 15:53.285
is that I actually cared about the victim,

15:54.161 --> 15:56.454
and I'm not gonna rest
until I find some answers.

15:56.455 --> 15:57.997
You're too close to this.

15:57.998 --> 16:00.333
Or maybe I didn't secretly hate the victim

16:00.334 --> 16:03.461
and then shut down the crime scene
for a full 30 minutes

16:03.462 --> 16:05.588
before calling in
the first ever murder down here.

16:05.589 --> 16:07.716
The murder of our president.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.515
His tablet is missing.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.477
Very important people are very upset.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.647
You better get your game face on.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.107
They've got questions.

16:39.415 --> 16:40.874
We're gonna need your weapon.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.712
It's a glorified Nerf gun, not a weapon.

16:45.713 --> 16:48.715
But sure. Go nuts.

16:48.716 --> 16:51.176
If you got nothing to hide,
then it shouldn't be a problem.

16:52.928 --> 16:54.220
Take a seat.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.067
Arms up.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.696
Should we be
worried about our safety?

17:11.321 --> 17:12.947
Now, let's not overreact here.

17:12.948 --> 17:14.991
-  Overreact?
-  Come on, Henry.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.951
The president
had a full security detail

17:16.952 --> 17:18.286
and he was murdered

17:18.287 --> 17:20.122
- in the residence.
- No, he wasn't.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.833
Cal Bradford died of natural causes,

17:23.834 --> 17:25.585
likely a heart attack.

17:25.586 --> 17:28.588
If you seriously think
you're gonna be able to contain this...

17:32.760 --> 17:34.844
Henry, we need some
solutions here.

17:37.306 --> 17:40.725
So, should I make lasagna
or should we order in?

17:40.726 --> 17:43.352
You're in the middle of the merger, hon.
You got the board up your ass.

17:43.353 --> 17:44.937
Let's just order in and make life easier.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.731
Oh, fair point. That said...

17:46.732 --> 17:48.232
Lasagna!

17:48.233 --> 17:49.942
I mean, the people have spoken.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.737
Hey, Dylan, not too far ahead, please.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.821
Mom, come on.

17:53.822 --> 17:55.615
Can we do the ice cream thing?

17:55.616 --> 17:59.703
Um... Daddy, can we?

18:01.705 --> 18:03.582
I'll get the rest of the stuff.
I'll meet you outside.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.042
Mm.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.919
You're very sexy when you do what I want.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.213
I know.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.009
Mm-hmm.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.387
You see it?

18:18.972 --> 18:20.723
I see it.

18:20.724 --> 18:25.186
Is it a sandwich, a cone, or a cup?

18:25.187 --> 18:26.729
Sandwich.

18:26.730 --> 18:29.982
- Rectangular or circular?
- Rectangle.

18:29.983 --> 18:32.319
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.670
- Horse?
-  Horse.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.552
We're gonna have dessert,

18:57.553 --> 18:59.304

What's this?

19:02.766 --> 19:04.433
Oh.

19:04.434 --> 19:06.060
- Or I'll just eat it.
- Okay.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.356
Make it fast.

19:10.357 --> 19:11.816
-  Want a bite?
-  Mm-hmm.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.110
-  No.
-  Fine, I'll eat it.

19:14.444 --> 19:15.445
Okay, good.

19:16.572 --> 19:17.698
I'll call you later.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.869
Board approved the merger.

19:22.870 --> 19:26.080
It's going through.

19:26.081 --> 19:27.582
- Wow, you hear this?
- Oh.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.375
Well, that was a lot
of worrying about nothing.

19:29.376 --> 19:31.795
-  No.
- Yeah. I'll eat the whole thing.

19:32.796 --> 19:33.881
Dylan?

19:35.757 --> 19:39.011
Dylan. Hey.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.596
Dylan!

19:48.395 --> 19:49.520
Enough!

19:53.942 --> 19:56.694
In 10 minutes,
the community will get an alert

19:56.695 --> 19:58.322
for an emergency town hall.

19:59.448 --> 20:02.158
They will gather here, and we will share
the shocking news

20:02.159 --> 20:03.993
that the president has passed

20:03.994 --> 20:07.456
of natural causes quietly in his bed.

20:08.248 --> 20:10.208
We will then immediately swear in Henry,

20:10.209 --> 20:11.751
which will settle everyone,

20:11.752 --> 20:14.045
because it will remind our community

20:14.046 --> 20:16.798
that we have a functional system in place.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.760
As for the rest of you,
your security will be increased

20:20.761 --> 20:23.304
until we find some answers.

20:23.305 --> 20:26.891
So, if you gentlemen will
just pour yourselves a drink

20:26.892 --> 20:29.101
or tug on your dicks,

20:29.102 --> 20:31.062
or do whatever it is you need to do

20:31.063 --> 20:32.605
to calm yourselves the fuck down,

20:32.606 --> 20:35.651
so that we can present a united front...

20:39.446 --> 20:40.989
well, that would be super.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.373
- Dr. Torabi, will you come with me?
- Yes.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.711
<i>Arm straight for me.
Fingers flat.</i>

21:19.653 --> 21:21.362
[over speakers] <i>He's set.</i>

21:21.363 --> 21:26.075
For the record,
your name is Xavier Collins.

21:26.076 --> 21:27.576
Correct?

21:27.577 --> 21:29.120
[over speakers] <i>Last I checked.</i>

21:29.121 --> 21:31.247
<i>Yes or no, please.</i>

21:31.248 --> 21:32.665
<i>Yes.</i>

21:32.666 --> 21:37.712
You have two children,
James and Presley, correct?

21:37.713 --> 21:38.796
Yes.

21:38.797 --> 21:41.841
Your wife was Dr. Teri Collins.

21:41.842 --> 21:44.135
She is deceased, correct?

21:44.136 --> 21:46.470
Dr. Teri Rogers-Collins. She hyphenated.

21:46.471 --> 21:48.307
Answer the question, please.

21:49.516 --> 21:53.352
Yes. Dr. Teri Rogers-Collins was my wife.

21:53.353 --> 21:55.147
Yes, she is deceased.

21:56.523 --> 21:59.525
When was the last time
you saw Cal Bradford alive?

21:59.526 --> 22:02.069
As I stated yesterday,
I walked the president to his room

22:02.070 --> 22:04.031
where he turned in at 22:04.

22:05.032 --> 22:07.325
And when did
you discover the body?

22:07.326 --> 22:10.161
I knocked on his door at 08:01.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.581
That's when I found him
lying next to his bed.

22:13.248 --> 22:15.207
<i>How long were you in there?</i>

22:15.208 --> 22:17.543
-  [over speakers] <i>I don't know.
-  You don't know?</i>

22:17.544 --> 22:20.338
I don't know how long
I looked at him like that.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.715
I just knew that he was gone.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.635
I just knew that I'd lost him.

22:30.223 --> 22:31.975
Did you take anything
from the scene?

22:36.396 --> 22:37.688
No.

22:37.689 --> 22:39.440
<i>Then, why the delay?</i>

22:39.441 --> 22:41.567
<i>Why did you call Agent Pace?</i>

22:41.568 --> 22:43.778
Agent Pace was the only person
I felt I could trust.

22:43.779 --> 22:46.114
- Are you covering for Agent Pace?
- No.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.450
I didn't feel comfortable
going through normal channels,

22:49.451 --> 22:51.452
because my boss
was sleeping with the president,

22:51.453 --> 22:53.829
and he was laying in there
on the floor dead.

22:53.830 --> 22:56.707
<i>You all know she was
sleeping with him, right?</i>

22:56.708 --> 22:58.542
<i>Wasn't a big secret, but still,</i>

22:58.543 --> 23:01.213
<i>it feels like an important bit of context.</i>

23:02.881 --> 23:05.299
You were the last person
to see the president alive.

23:05.300 --> 23:07.802
Nobody entered that room
from the time that you shut the door--

23:07.803 --> 23:09.721
Just ask the fucking question.

23:14.184 --> 23:15.352
Did you kill him?

23:17.187 --> 23:18.188
No.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.316
I did not murder Cal Bradford.

23:24.444 --> 23:26.362
-  <i>Take me through the steps.
- May I?</i>

23:26.363 --> 23:28.739
<i>What happened in that
time? In that room?</i>

23:30.742 --> 23:32.034
<i>The president is normally up</i>

23:32.035 --> 23:33.285
<i>and about before 8:00 a.m.,</i>

23:33.286 --> 23:34.913
<i>but he wasn't on this particular day.</i>

23:35.914 --> 23:38.290
<i>I knocked on his door
three times before I entered.</i>

23:38.291 --> 23:40.709
<i>I saw his body on the ground
covered in blood.</i>

23:40.710 --> 23:43.380
<i>I checked his pulse. There was nothing.</i>

23:43.964 --> 23:45.881
I was concerned that there
could have been some theft--

23:47.134 --> 23:48.927
Thank you, Agent Robinson.

23:52.055 --> 23:53.181
-  I was--
- Thank you.

24:04.901 --> 24:07.028
Xavier. Hi.

24:08.196 --> 24:10.823
My name is Gabriela Torabi.
Do you remember me?

24:10.824 --> 24:12.534
You were the president's therapist.

24:13.577 --> 24:14.786
I was yours, too.

24:15.787 --> 24:17.079
Once.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.497
<i>That's right, yes.</i>

24:18.498 --> 24:23.170
<i>Uh, we did one session together, early on.</i>

24:24.171 --> 24:26.505
<i>I have just one other
question for you, if I may.</i>

24:26.506 --> 24:28.966
It's, um...

24:28.967 --> 24:30.384
It's a little less formal,

24:30.385 --> 24:31.470
so if you can,

24:32.554 --> 24:33.847
try to answer honestly.

24:36.766 --> 24:38.517
Is a part of you happy that Cal is dead?

24:57.329 --> 24:58.330
Yes.

25:11.593 --> 25:14.179
As I've told you about 19 times,
I'm not an interrogator.

25:15.305 --> 25:17.973
But you saw his vitals
remained stable throughout.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.687
What do you think?

25:24.773 --> 25:27.149
I think he's telling the truth.

25:27.150 --> 25:28.235
Why?

25:29.778 --> 25:32.821
Well, if he's such a well-practiced liar,

25:32.822 --> 25:34.658
then why would he admit

25:35.367 --> 25:36.825
to hating the man that was murdered?

25:36.826 --> 25:38.619
It doesn't track.

26:01.351 --> 26:04.645
Mr. and Mrs. Redmond,
thank you for seeing me.

26:04.646 --> 26:07.983
We've been treating Dylan
for over a year and a half.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.568
He has gotten better care than

26:10.569 --> 26:12.695
frankly any patient I've ever seen.

26:12.696 --> 26:16.116
Best doctors in the world,
cutting-edge treatments.

26:17.117 --> 26:21.746
Unfortunately, I think it's time
for an impossible conversation.

26:22.706 --> 26:23.957
- What? Oh...
- No.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.084
- Oh my--
- No.

26:27.085 --> 26:30.004
The specialist in Japan was optimistic,

26:30.005 --> 26:32.965
which I've been telling you all

26:32.966 --> 26:35.342
is something that we could use
a lot more of around here.

26:35.343 --> 26:37.261
And he was gonna look
at the latest scans and--

26:37.262 --> 26:38.430
He did.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.016
He did.

26:43.268 --> 26:44.853
I will find someone else.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.481
I will find someone better.

26:52.694 --> 26:54.779
I've, uh, asked someone to join us.

27:01.119 --> 27:02.370
Hello.

27:04.122 --> 27:06.123
This is Dr. Gabriela Torabi.

27:06.124 --> 27:09.169
She's a world-class therapist
and grief specialist.

27:10.170 --> 27:13.005
She has done incredible work
helping many people in your situation.

27:13.006 --> 27:14.090
No.

27:16.217 --> 27:17.217
- Come here.
- No.

27:17.218 --> 27:18.302
No, just--

27:18.303 --> 27:20.347
- Mrs. Redmond.
- Excuse me.

27:26.436 --> 27:28.562
-  [over speakers] <i>Arms up.
- You better be right.</i>

27:30.690 --> 27:32.692
You brought me here
because I'm always right.

27:33.777 --> 27:36.488
I brought you here because
I admire your pantsuits.

27:38.281 --> 27:39.574
Well, shit, Samantha.

27:40.533 --> 27:42.409
That might be the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

27:56.841 --> 27:58.926
Agent Collins, come with me.

28:07.227 --> 28:08.853
I appreciate you going through all that.

28:10.230 --> 28:12.232
Obviously, we're all on edge here.

28:14.359 --> 28:15.694
Do you know what I do here?

28:16.319 --> 28:17.362
Yes, ma'am.

28:18.446 --> 28:20.699
I know that everyone
seems to take direction from you.

28:21.866 --> 28:24.327
I know that the president seemed
to take direction from you.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.039
Do you know why my detail
calls me Sinatra?

28:30.542 --> 28:33.001
You can speak freely, Agent Collins.

28:33.002 --> 28:35.088
I always assumed it was
because of the hats.

28:36.673 --> 28:39.134
- Cute.
- Thank you.

28:48.226 --> 28:50.811
I became an absolute walking encyclopedia

28:50.812 --> 28:52.981
on all things Agent Collins last night.

28:54.149 --> 28:55.816
Only child.

28:55.817 --> 28:57.861
Grandfather, a Tuskegee Airman.

28:59.070 --> 29:02.197
Your father was one of the first
Black commercial airline pilots.

29:02.198 --> 29:03.408
That's quite a legacy.

29:04.701 --> 29:06.870
They must have been so proud of you...

29:08.747 --> 29:10.457
the man who took a bullet
for the president.

29:12.834 --> 29:15.085
Last few days must have been
especially hard on you.

29:20.925 --> 29:23.594
Agent Robinson
will continue the investigation,

29:23.595 --> 29:25.929
but to preserve his memory,
we'll be telling everyone

29:25.930 --> 29:28.849
that President Bradford
died of natural causes.

29:28.850 --> 29:31.144
We think it's what's best
for the community.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.439
Why did your wife use a hyphenate?

29:35.440 --> 29:37.399
Her father died when she was very young.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.027
She couldn't bear the thought
of his name dying with him.

29:40.028 --> 29:43.280
Well, that makes sense.
Do you have the tablet?

29:43.281 --> 29:44.783
No. No, I do not.

29:47.243 --> 29:48.869
You'll remain on leave
for the next two weeks,

29:48.870 --> 29:50.245
and then we'll reassign you.

29:50.246 --> 29:51.872
Ma'am, I think I'd be better utilized--

29:51.873 --> 29:53.373
And I do not. And I'm more important.

29:58.588 --> 30:00.590
Robinson tells me you have children.

30:01.674 --> 30:04.469
Yes, I do. A boy and a girl.

30:07.347 --> 30:09.182
God, that must be tough without their mom.

30:14.604 --> 30:15.896
I had two children.

30:31.746 --> 30:33.122
Thank you for seeing me.

30:35.291 --> 30:36.584
It's been a while.

30:39.087 --> 30:40.380
How are you?

30:47.887 --> 30:50.681
I'm not great, honestly.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.570
Everyone said time would help.

31:07.699 --> 31:08.825
But it isn't.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.705
It's been six months. So...

31:17.542 --> 31:18.877
It's not helping.

31:21.921 --> 31:24.172
Time is actually making it worse,

31:24.173 --> 31:26.885
because it's taking me further away...

31:33.683 --> 31:35.143
...from when he was here.

31:40.523 --> 31:42.567
You were kind to me then.

31:44.485 --> 31:45.904
You helped me.

31:48.114 --> 31:49.782
And I need your help.

31:52.869 --> 31:54.578
Right now.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.663
Of course. Yes. Yes.

31:56.664 --> 32:02.462
Um, but healing is a long, slow process.

32:04.672 --> 32:09.092
Yeah, I have no desire to be...

32:09.093 --> 32:11.596
...healed.

32:14.390 --> 32:17.726
I-I'm-- I'm broken forever.

32:17.727 --> 32:20.646
My marriage is broken forever.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.064
But I have a business,

32:22.065 --> 32:24.984
a giant business, where there are

32:25.777 --> 32:28.780
tens of thousands
of people who rely on me.

32:37.914 --> 32:39.581
And I have a daughter.

32:39.582 --> 32:41.792
I still have my daughter.

32:41.793 --> 32:46.463
And if she so much as sneezes,
then my-- my heart stops.

32:48.216 --> 32:51.051
And I need to be functional for her.

32:51.052 --> 32:53.053
I don't need to be healed.

32:53.054 --> 32:54.638
I just need to be functional enough

32:54.639 --> 32:55.931
that I can think about something

32:55.932 --> 32:59.226
other than throwing myself
off a fucking roof!

33:07.276 --> 33:08.694
I'll pay you.

33:08.695 --> 33:11.738
I-- you will be richer
than your wildest dreams.

33:11.739 --> 33:13.365
You won't need a single other client.

33:13.366 --> 33:14.993
- Oh--
- So, I'll just--

33:17.078 --> 33:19.079
She's all I have,
so I need you to help me.

33:24.043 --> 33:26.254
- Samantha--
- Please help me.

33:28.381 --> 33:29.632
I need you to help me.

33:34.345 --> 33:35.555
Will you help me?

33:40.893 --> 33:43.229
I had two children and I lost one of them.

33:45.189 --> 33:47.692
Trust me, Agent Collins,
that is something you never get over.

33:51.404 --> 33:54.866
Take the leave of absence.
Leave this alone.

33:56.826 --> 33:58.326
Mic check

33:58.327 --> 33:59.703
in five minutes, everybody.

33:59.704 --> 34:02.457
There's gonna be a
mic check in five minutes.

34:15.178 --> 34:19.056
My God, First Boy looks
extra pathetic today.

34:19.057 --> 34:21.641
Did his sad eyelashes get even longer?

34:21.642 --> 34:24.728
- Lisa.
- I mean it in a good way.

34:24.729 --> 34:27.272
It, like, enhances his whole look.

34:37.408 --> 34:38.909
Everyone, I don't know what this is,

34:38.910 --> 34:40.911
but let's all head over together.

34:40.912 --> 34:42.662
We're going this way, folks. Come on.

35:16.656 --> 35:20.534
Hi, did a guy come through here,
around my age?

35:20.535 --> 35:21.743
Stupid haircut?

35:21.744 --> 35:24.038
Everyone your age has stupid haircuts,

35:24.997 --> 35:26.748
but if you're referring
to Jeremy Bradford,

35:26.749 --> 35:27.958
he's in the media rotunda.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.460
Cool, thanks.

35:55.653 --> 35:57.113
Why aren't you at the town hall thing?

35:58.197 --> 35:59.240
Why aren't you?

36:30.021 --> 36:31.147
Hello, Xavier.

36:32.273 --> 36:36.068
Madam First Lady. How are you holding up?

36:39.071 --> 36:42.991
Honestly, I have no fucking clue, Xavier.

36:45.536 --> 36:48.371
I've been pretending for so long,

36:48.372 --> 36:51.124
pretending to be part
of this all-American family

36:51.125 --> 36:54.920
while living in separate houses,
pretending to be a loving wife

36:54.921 --> 36:57.757
until the moment his term ended.

37:02.595 --> 37:04.138
It wasn't all pretend.

37:05.514 --> 37:06.599
I know.

37:08.351 --> 37:10.060
- He worshipped you.
- Oh, geez.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.728
He did.

37:11.729 --> 37:13.313
Do you remember that time when you joined

37:13.314 --> 37:15.023
Saturday morning basketball

37:15.024 --> 37:16.608
- at the White House?
-  I do.

37:17.985 --> 37:21.279
Cal was so excited
to have you on his team,

37:21.280 --> 37:25.368
because he-- he just assumed
that you'd be good.

37:26.494 --> 37:27.495
Cal was...

37:28.913 --> 37:30.080
Racist.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.666
He loved an outdated stereotype.

37:32.667 --> 37:34.335
- We'll leave it at that.
- Okay.

37:36.629 --> 37:39.381
He was surprised, of course,
to find out that you were--

37:39.382 --> 37:40.882
you were just an average player.

37:40.883 --> 37:43.260
You know, he came running into the bedroom

37:43.261 --> 37:44.344
dripping with sweat,

37:44.345 --> 37:46.179
hair plastered against his forehead

37:46.180 --> 37:47.431
like a six-year-old boy.

37:48.683 --> 37:50.892
- "I'm better than him, babe."
- He was not better than me.

37:50.893 --> 37:53.728
Well, I wasn't there.

37:53.729 --> 37:54.981
Okay.

37:58.192 --> 38:00.278
But he couldn't get over
how hard you played.

38:03.572 --> 38:05.241
How you never stopped.

38:06.367 --> 38:08.744
"The man is relentless," he said.

38:15.626 --> 38:18.462
They're about to tell everybody
that Cal died of natural causes.

38:20.464 --> 38:21.589
I know.

38:21.590 --> 38:24.051
They wouldn't let me look at the body.

38:26.262 --> 38:28.139
I saw the body.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.399
He loved you.

38:39.483 --> 38:42.152
The man who was everything
he felt he wasn't.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.946
The relentless man...

38:45.114 --> 38:46.532
who never stopped.

39:02.048 --> 39:03.924
Mommy?

39:06.802 --> 39:08.720
Where are you going, Mommy?

39:08.721 --> 39:10.555
I have a work trip, remember?

39:10.556 --> 39:12.224
But I don't want you
to leave forever.

39:18.731 --> 39:19.899
Hey.

39:23.277 --> 39:24.362
Listen.

39:27.156 --> 39:29.699
I'll always come back, okay?

39:29.700 --> 39:31.827
I'll always come back to take care of you.

39:39.460 --> 39:40.753
Go see him.

39:43.839 --> 39:44.840
Hey, kiddo.

39:49.261 --> 39:51.346
Pst, pst.

40:00.815 --> 40:02.899
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,

40:02.900 --> 40:05.402
to this year's conference.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.696
<i>We have some scintillating
conversations lined up for you,</i>

40:08.697 --> 40:11.866
<i>covering global security,
cyber engineering,</i>

40:11.867 --> 40:14.994
<i>climate change, and much more.</i>

40:14.995 --> 40:17.372
<i>We are here to begin
what we hope will become,</i>

40:17.373 --> 40:19.833
<i>not just conversations or projects,</i>

40:19.834 --> 40:22.168
<i>but the future of our world.</i>

40:22.169 --> 40:24.712
Within a year, 20% of all livestock

40:24.713 --> 40:26.841
will perish from fluorosis poisoning.

40:31.512 --> 40:34.431
Well, I guess I'll go ahead
and start wrapping up,

40:34.432 --> 40:37.517
since this talk has proven
to be the one to miss.

40:38.853 --> 40:42.022
Ironic, because it's
the only one that matters.

40:45.025 --> 40:48.361
Listen, I know this all
sounds pretty far-fetched,

40:48.362 --> 40:51.030
but you know when it
won't seem far-fetched?

40:51.031 --> 40:52.574
In less than a decade,

40:52.575 --> 40:55.034
when a tsunami plunges
the entire Eastern Seaboard

40:55.035 --> 40:57.287
of the United States underwater.

41:08.674 --> 41:10.091
Well, I'm done.

41:10.092 --> 41:12.427
Try not to get trampled on the way out

41:12.428 --> 41:14.388
unless you prefer that to being drowned.

41:24.356 --> 41:26.400
Hey, wait. Sam.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.364
Well, that guy was a barrel
of laughs, wasn't he?

41:33.365 --> 41:34.450
Yeah.

41:35.784 --> 41:36.827
How you been?

41:38.913 --> 41:41.122
I'm fine. Thanks, senator.

41:41.123 --> 41:42.291
Yeah?

41:43.959 --> 41:45.919
It's been just over a year, right?

41:45.920 --> 41:47.087
Since you lost your son?

41:49.298 --> 41:51.050
One year, that's...

41:52.843 --> 41:53.969
That's hard.

41:55.596 --> 41:57.556
That must feel like no time at all to you.

42:00.267 --> 42:01.519
I can't imagine.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.564
God, he was such a cute kid.

42:06.565 --> 42:08.900
I remember him
running around a little sandbox.

42:08.901 --> 42:10.401
He just-- with big old handfuls of sand

42:10.402 --> 42:11.903
and just dump it on his head.

42:13.989 --> 42:15.574
I'm sorry, Sam, I didn't...

42:17.159 --> 42:19.119
No, don't be.

42:22.998 --> 42:24.749
No one's...

42:29.380 --> 42:31.215
No one's talked to me about Dylan

42:32.049 --> 42:34.343
for a very long time, that directly.

42:38.305 --> 42:39.557
Thanks, Cal.

42:41.225 --> 42:43.018
I think I finally see why people like you.

42:43.602 --> 42:44.727
It's mainly the hair.

42:44.728 --> 42:48.064
Mm-hmm.

42:48.065 --> 42:51.776
You, however, you got the real stuff, Sam.

42:51.777 --> 42:53.027
You got the stuff that makes people

42:53.028 --> 42:54.487
sit up straight when you walk in a room.

42:54.488 --> 42:57.366
My old man,
I hear it from him all the time.

42:59.326 --> 43:02.745
- How is your dad?
- Still just a light touch of dementia.

43:02.746 --> 43:04.998
- Mm.
- But he's still him.

43:04.999 --> 43:07.585
Still crushing me with blows like,

43:08.168 --> 43:09.836
"You think you're Dean Martin

43:09.837 --> 43:11.212
"walking around with your cock out.

43:11.213 --> 43:13.840
"You ain't Dean. You're a joke.
You're Peter Lawford.

43:13.841 --> 43:16.092
You're only in the band
'cause of who you're related to."

43:16.093 --> 43:17.261
- Jesus.
- Yeah. Yeah.

43:17.845 --> 43:19.304
That's Christmas morning, mind you.

43:19.305 --> 43:20.931
My loving daddy.

43:21.432 --> 43:24.017
Yeah.

43:24.018 --> 43:25.311
He says...

43:26.395 --> 43:28.564
he says you're Sinatra, by the way.

43:30.232 --> 43:31.775
The clear leader. The one.

43:33.319 --> 43:34.819
I don't know about that.

43:34.820 --> 43:36.404
Mm.

43:36.405 --> 43:37.865
No, I have this thing...

43:39.033 --> 43:42.620
this disorder where I pick at my hair.

43:43.912 --> 43:45.164
I'm getting a bald spot.

43:46.540 --> 43:48.334
Sometimes I have to wear hats.

43:51.378 --> 43:52.504
I'm no Sinatra.

43:57.593 --> 43:58.761
I miss my kid.

44:00.137 --> 44:02.222
- I know.
- Hey!

44:07.519 --> 44:10.146
- If that stuff happens--
- It's going to happen.

44:10.147 --> 44:12.191
And it's going to happen
in the next decade.

44:13.192 --> 44:14.485
So, what do we do?

44:17.446 --> 44:18.739
I have a daughter.

44:23.827 --> 44:25.162
What do we do?

44:26.455 --> 44:30.000
You dig the biggest
hole you can, and you get in.

44:34.046 --> 44:35.713
Jesus, somebody ought to get that guy

44:35.714 --> 44:37.257
a slot at the Laugh Factory.

44:38.842 --> 44:40.177
You going to the next talk?

44:41.970 --> 44:43.555
No, I'm done talking.

44:46.058 --> 44:47.559
Thanks for asking about Dylan.

44:49.728 --> 44:51.396
Hey, wait up.

44:55.943 --> 44:58.945
Samantha, a couple of thoughts
on the speech.

44:58.946 --> 45:00.488
- Here, it--
- Just read it, Henry.

45:00.489 --> 45:02.533
We didn't pick you to have thoughts.

45:16.755 --> 45:20.926
My fellow Americans,
I'm afraid I have terrible news.

45:22.386 --> 45:23.886
President Cal Bradford

45:23.887 --> 45:25.763
passed away early yesterday morning.

45:31.979 --> 45:33.063
You okay?

45:42.281 --> 45:43.407
My dad is dead.

45:45.993 --> 45:49.621
They, uh... they took everyone
to the arena to tell them.

45:52.082 --> 45:55.753
I asked that everyone
learn this awful news together

45:56.378 --> 45:58.588
so that we could be
comforted by our friends

45:58.589 --> 46:00.007
and our community.

46:00.591 --> 46:02.425
Those who've helped us grieve

46:02.426 --> 46:04.803
and heal over the past three years.

46:07.097 --> 46:08.932
I ghosted him yesterday.

46:10.434 --> 46:13.103
And that means that,
that our fight last week was...

46:14.563 --> 46:16.482
It was the last time I ever talked to him.

46:17.983 --> 46:21.361
I told him that he was the reason
so many people are gone.

46:22.738 --> 46:26.658
I told him that I wished he was dead.

46:28.452 --> 46:30.703
It's the last thing I ever said to my dad.

46:30.704 --> 46:33.498
In a few moments,
I will take the oath of office

46:33.499 --> 46:35.750
and become our next president.

46:35.751 --> 46:39.838
But first, I'd like to say
a few words about Cal.

46:41.006 --> 46:46.720
He, um... he loved this shitty
'80s and '90s rock music.

46:47.763 --> 46:50.598
And when I was younger,
he would dance around with me

46:50.599 --> 46:54.269
and scream it at the
top of his lungs, and, uh...

46:57.773 --> 47:00.399
And then I grew up, and just told him

47:00.400 --> 47:02.861
how lame I thought his music was
every chance I got.

47:04.780 --> 47:05.948
Now, here I am,

47:06.532 --> 47:10.244
listening to the music that my dad loved.

47:12.329 --> 47:14.248
The music I told him I hated.

47:14.748 --> 47:17.291
Cal was the kind of guy

47:17.292 --> 47:20.337
who would go up to a complete stranger
in a parking lot

47:21.004 --> 47:22.840
and say something tender to them,

47:23.465 --> 47:25.466
something they really needed,

47:25.467 --> 47:28.387
just because he could sense
they were in pain.

47:32.641 --> 47:34.726
My dad's into planes.

47:36.770 --> 47:40.065
He-- he got his pilot's license
and everything.

47:43.360 --> 47:47.698
He used to talk about planes all the time.

47:48.740 --> 47:51.325
<i>And each time, I'd tell him
what a massive dork he was.</i>

47:51.326 --> 47:52.910
He would tell us that we must...

47:52.911 --> 47:55.247
<i>He never talks about
them anymore.</i>

47:58.333 --> 47:59.917
Oh, what I'd give to listen to him

47:59.918 --> 48:02.086
ramble on about planes again.

48:06.842 --> 48:09.135
What were you, uh, listening to

48:09.136 --> 48:12.179
of your dad's lame '80s and '90s rock?

48:12.180 --> 48:13.432
Um...

48:15.267 --> 48:16.976
Do, uh...

48:16.977 --> 48:19.229
- you know this one?
- Mm-mm.

48:22.149 --> 48:23.400
Play it for me?

48:23.817 --> 48:26.528
I take no responsibility
for what you're about to hear.

48:36.955 --> 48:40.416
<i>♪ We built this city on rock and roll ♪</i>

48:40.417 --> 48:43.252
<i>- ♪ Built this city ♪
-  And I will...</i>

48:43.253 --> 48:48.841
<i>♪ We built this city on rock and roll ♪</i>

49:05.067 --> 49:06.318
And?

49:07.486 --> 49:10.404
Maybe it's not so bad
that the world ended.

49:10.405 --> 49:11.572
Yeah.

49:11.573 --> 49:13.616
The bastards were asking for it.

49:18.538 --> 49:21.416
Do, uh... do you wanna see something cool?

49:24.586 --> 49:25.628
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

49:25.629 --> 49:27.005
Okay. Come on.

49:30.842 --> 49:33.553
- Go have a drink.
- Yeah. We will.

49:43.605 --> 49:44.856
You good?

49:50.862 --> 49:54.365
Can you think of any important
six-digit codes down here?

49:54.366 --> 49:55.867
Password? Symbol?

49:57.786 --> 49:59.203
No. Why?

50:02.332 --> 50:04.835
I spent 15 years as an agent
in the real world.

50:06.253 --> 50:08.546
The main question I'd always get,

50:08.547 --> 50:11.382
"Is it hard always watching everything,

50:11.383 --> 50:13.551
always listening, never talking?"

50:13.552 --> 50:15.887
- Hmm.
- And I'd always answer,

50:16.930 --> 50:18.265
"That's my job."

50:20.767 --> 50:22.686
I was real good at my job, Billy.

50:24.354 --> 50:26.815
And I've been watching her.

50:28.191 --> 50:29.443
Sinatra.

50:30.527 --> 50:32.279
I've been listening to her.

50:33.822 --> 50:35.906
And something's not right with that woman.

50:35.907 --> 50:37.950
I can feel it in my gut.

50:37.951 --> 50:39.660
Our guy is gone,

50:39.661 --> 50:41.663
and she's smack in the middle
of the whole thing.

50:45.292 --> 50:48.462
She's pretty much the most powerful
person down here.

50:49.921 --> 50:51.006
Yeah.

50:52.174 --> 50:53.717
And I'm gonna take her down.

50:57.012 --> 50:58.013
How?

50:59.723 --> 51:01.600
Very fuckin' carefully.

51:11.568 --> 51:12.569
Hey, Mom.

51:23.246 --> 51:24.414
Everything okay?

51:26.208 --> 51:28.125
You hanging in?

51:28.126 --> 51:30.087
Yeah, I'm fine.

51:30.879 --> 51:32.630
Don't stay up too late.

51:50.273 --> 51:51.941
No one's really allowed down here.

52:09.626 --> 52:12.379
Holy shit.
