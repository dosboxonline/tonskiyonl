00:06.214 --> 00:09.259
<i>Hangman</i>

00:19.561 --> 00:20.645
Sofia...

00:22.480 --> 00:25.316
Sofia, you need to go inside.

00:35.702 --> 00:36.745
Sofia...

00:47.088 --> 00:48.131
You're here.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.973
Alberto, your finger...

00:56.973 --> 00:58.600
I swear to God,

00:58.600 --> 01:00.435
one day,
I'll get you outta here.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.815
Berto, behind you! Berto! Berto!

01:05.815 --> 01:07.359
No, no, no, no, no!

01:17.744 --> 01:19.037
No!

01:20.413 --> 01:21.623
Sofia...

01:22.540 --> 01:23.708
You're safe.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.133
It's okay. It's okay.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.093
Get off of me!

01:34.552 --> 01:35.887
Sofia-- Sofia!

01:35.887 --> 01:37.639
Sofia, it's okay.

01:37.639 --> 01:40.058
Sofia... Okay, okay...

01:40.058 --> 01:41.643
Deep breaths. Come on.

01:41.643 --> 01:42.560
Deep breaths.

01:44.729 --> 01:45.772
Count with me.

01:50.276 --> 01:51.653
In for four...

01:56.741 --> 01:58.034
And then out...

02:05.500 --> 02:06.668
There you go.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.087
Good.

02:09.754 --> 02:11.589
Do you see the pictures
on the wall?

02:14.259 --> 02:15.176
Uh-huh.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.470
The items on my desk?

02:30.608 --> 02:32.152
You're not in Arkham anymore.

02:34.696 --> 02:35.739
You're safe.

02:45.206 --> 02:47.375
- Tell me what you saw.
- I have to go.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.046
I can help you, Sofia.

02:51.046 --> 02:52.255
You're safe.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.385
I'm not safe.

03:00.680 --> 03:01.931
I'm home.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.311
Didn't know I was walkin'
into a party.

03:48.853 --> 03:51.064
- I woulda brought something.
- You cocky motherfucker.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.233
Tryin' to force my hand
to take a fall for you?

03:53.233 --> 03:56.569
I ain't forcing nothin', Sal.
I saw an opportunity, is all.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.071
The streets are talkin' again!

03:58.571 --> 04:00.031
They know there's only
one man big enough

04:00.031 --> 04:01.241
to go against the Falcones,

04:01.241 --> 04:03.451
Salvatore motherfuckin' Maroni.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.245
You want the credit.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.205
You deserve the credit.
And it's yours.

04:08.206 --> 04:12.127
Or... I could drop your name
to the Falcones right now

04:12.669 --> 04:14.754
and stop this war
you've brought on my Family.

04:15.505 --> 04:16.965
Tell 'em it was you
that whacked Alberto

04:16.965 --> 04:19.134
and watch 'em slice you
from earhole to asshole.

04:19.134 --> 04:22.512
Well, yeah, I mean,
that's another way to go.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.391
But you're wearin' that ring
around here, Sal.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.184
You're already gloatin'.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.395
You might as well lean in.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.023
Listen...

04:33.690 --> 04:36.192
The Falcones are still
lickin' their wounds.

04:37.235 --> 04:38.653
They're distracted.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.905
And I got the inside track
with the new Don.

04:41.614 --> 04:43.825
They brought in
Carmine's brother, Luca.

04:43.825 --> 04:46.453
He's a fuckin' pussy,
but I got his ear.

04:47.829 --> 04:48.747
This can work.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.292
We can take 'em all down, Sal.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.129
But you gotta do your part.

05:08.266 --> 05:12.145
I claim Alberto, you make good
on the Drops you promised.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.191
This is Ervad, one of my capos.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.777
- He'll run point.
- It's a simple route.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.653
Straight shot to Robbinsville.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.655
No highways. All neighborhoods.

05:22.655 --> 05:23.948
Nice work, boys. Do it up.

05:23.948 --> 05:25.408
<i>We use the FEMA truck
as our cover,</i>

05:25.408 --> 05:26.993
<i>and the Drops'll
be sittin' pretty</i>

05:26.993 --> 05:28.787
<i>inside barrels
of "Emergency Water."</i>

05:30.413 --> 05:31.373
Hey, Castillo.

05:32.665 --> 05:33.833
No hard feelings, right?

05:33.833 --> 05:36.127
We're all on the same side.

05:37.295 --> 05:38.630
Yeah, sure, Oz.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.006
- Yeah.
- Good.

05:41.299 --> 05:44.135
<i>Everyone in the lead car
and truck, they're patsies.</i>

05:44.135 --> 05:46.763
You waste 'em,
you get your drugs

05:46.763 --> 05:47.722
and some blood.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.265
- That it?
- Yeah.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.560
Alright, lock it up.
Let's head out!

05:53.353 --> 05:54.854
But the follow car,
that's where I'll be.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.439
You don't fuckin' touch that.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.525
I'll be there making sure
that you get what's yours

05:58.525 --> 05:59.901
without a hitch.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.361
- Sound good?
- Yeah.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.362
Boom.

06:02.862 --> 06:03.905
Everything goes simple.

06:04.781 --> 06:05.782
Penguin!

06:13.081 --> 06:14.541
You're on the truck
with the product.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.001
Johnny. Nice to see you, too.

06:16.001 --> 06:18.753
But listen, I got it all set.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.296
I'm in the, uh, follow car.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.048
The truck is packed.
Ready to go. All good--

06:22.048 --> 06:23.299
The fuck's your head at?

06:23.299 --> 06:24.592
We're in the middle
of a gang war.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.928
I'm just doin' what I was told.
Ain't my idea to close shop

06:26.928 --> 06:28.513
and move the product
to Robbinsville.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.557
We're adding artillery
to every vehicle.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.892
And your operation... Right?

06:32.892 --> 06:34.728
That's what you said,
it's your operation.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.187
...means you're on the truck.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.066
Let's go.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.022
They're at the underpass.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.190
Get ready.

07:28.948 --> 07:32.202
Hey, why do seagulls
fly over the sea?

07:34.829 --> 07:36.623
'Cause if they flew
over the bay,

07:36.623 --> 07:37.749
they'd be bagels.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.461
You get it?
Bagels! Like the bread.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.254
Yeah, I get it now, Ray.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.256
Thanks for the explanation.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.269
Hey, I got one for ya.

08:00.355 --> 08:03.024
What's the difference between
the Mafia and the government?

08:05.193 --> 08:06.903
One of 'em is organized!

08:07.696 --> 08:08.738
See, Ray?

08:08.738 --> 08:10.240
You just gotta know
your audience!

08:13.410 --> 08:14.536
Shit!

08:30.760 --> 08:32.345
Whoa! Hold up, Ervad!

08:32.345 --> 08:33.513
I got your Drops right here.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.598
Oz, you fuckin' traitor!

08:38.351 --> 08:39.561
What the fuck?!

09:07.797 --> 09:08.631
Shit.

09:09.424 --> 09:10.342
Shit.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.056
Castillo!

09:19.017 --> 09:20.518
Castillo! Let's go!

09:21.895 --> 09:22.771
Let's go!

09:23.730 --> 09:24.773
Get in.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.370
We're just riding down
the fuckin' road,

09:38.370 --> 09:40.872
and then the truck...
gets lit up.

09:40.872 --> 09:43.625
First SUV crashes,
we hop out of the car,

09:43.625 --> 09:46.670
we're fucking shot.
I'm beating some fucking guy...

09:46.670 --> 09:48.588
I'm definitely dead
without this motherfucker.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.423
Castillo here is dead
if it wasn't for Oz.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.759
And then we fucking lock up
and jump in the truck.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.553
We're driving off.
Shots everywhere.

09:55.553 --> 09:56.846
It was fucking crazy.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.393
What the fuck
was I supposed to do?

10:01.393 --> 10:03.228
They ambushed us
'cause they think we're weak.

10:03.228 --> 10:04.187
I tried to tell ya--

10:04.187 --> 10:06.189
We look weak
'cause you let 'em fuck us.

10:06.189 --> 10:07.732
Hey, it was your route!

10:07.732 --> 10:09.442
We were sittin' ducks out there.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.111
If it weren't for me,
more men woulda died.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.987
Please. You didn't do shit
to protect our Drops.

10:12.987 --> 10:15.824
The Maronis walked away
with the whole goddamn stash.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.283
Is that all you care about?

10:17.283 --> 10:19.869
The product? The money we lost?

10:21.746 --> 10:23.081
We can get more money, gentlemen.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.875
You're missing the point here.
They humiliated our Family.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.003
I mean, they took my brother,
and they shoved his body

10:28.003 --> 10:30.797
in the trunk of a car,
like he was a piece of trash.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.758
Look, Sofia, we all cared
for Alberto--

10:33.758 --> 10:35.635
Well, I doubt that, Milos.
I really do.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.262
Justice is what matters.

10:37.262 --> 10:40.724
And that is what my brother,
your nephew, deserves.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.559
Hear, hear.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.604
Why aren't his killers
strung up across the city?

10:47.397 --> 10:49.941
When the time is right,
the Maronis'll pay.

10:49.941 --> 10:51.526
The Maronis. Right, okay.

10:51.526 --> 10:53.486
Well, open your eyes.
They weren't working alone.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.697
How'd they know about our route?

10:55.697 --> 10:57.073
How'd they know about
the FEMA truck?

10:57.073 --> 10:59.367
They had someone on the inside,
helping them.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.661
Someone in our own Family.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.329
How dare you with this shit.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.790
You waltzin' in here
like you mean something.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.500
You don't call the shots
around here.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.002
Johnny! Neither do you.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.338
And this is my niece
you're talking to.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.965
Show her some fucking respect.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.634
Sorry, Luca. You're right.

11:18.553 --> 11:19.721
Sofia...

11:21.639 --> 11:23.058
my apologies.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.811
Increase security
around the house

11:26.811 --> 11:28.938
and all our businesses.
Put the word out.

11:28.938 --> 11:32.525
If anybody outside the network
is selling our Drops,

11:33.318 --> 11:34.569
they'll answer for it.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.280
Let's call it a night.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.037
You need anything from me, Boss?

11:44.037 --> 11:45.288
You've done enough.

11:50.335 --> 11:51.711
Sofia...

11:52.379 --> 11:53.296
Stay.

12:02.222 --> 12:06.017
You've always had a nose
for bullshit, Sofia.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.728
Your father knew that too.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.731
But if there's a rat,
we'll find him.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.650
But the when and the how,
that...

12:15.026 --> 12:16.361
that ain't up to you.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.864
The when and the how...

12:21.157 --> 12:22.242
That's your call.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.619
Because you're the Boss.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.208
I'm gonna let that one slide.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.293
'Cause you're grieving.

12:32.836 --> 12:33.962
We're all grieving.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.840
Your brother's funeral
is tomorrow.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.134
Just focus on
laying him to rest.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.513
I'll deal with
the Family business.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.771
- Sofia.
- What do you want, Oz?

12:52.355 --> 12:53.732
I know we've got
our differences.

12:53.732 --> 12:55.692
You made that
pretty fuckin' clear.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.944
But I'm willin' to look past
the pain you put me through,

12:57.944 --> 12:59.362
if you are.

12:59.362 --> 13:00.864
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.532
Look, I'm on your side.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.076
I saved your boy
Castillo's life tonight,

13:05.076 --> 13:06.745
even after what he did to me.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.663
What're we runnin',
a marathon here?

13:08.663 --> 13:11.207
Listen, what you said
about an inside man.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.751
I believe you.
I could ask around.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.419
Do some digging.
Whatever you need.

13:14.419 --> 13:15.587
Why would you do that?

13:16.588 --> 13:19.466
Because it should be you
in there, callin' the shots.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.885
You should be the new boss,
not Carmine's little brother.

13:21.885 --> 13:23.178
- Careful--
-"Careful" whatever.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.554
I know I shouldn't say it.
So what?

13:25.388 --> 13:27.474
Al is dead. I loved him, too.

13:28.016 --> 13:29.309
More than those pricks.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.226
And look...

13:30.810 --> 13:33.313
If one of 'em had a hand in it,
who's to say you ain't next?

13:33.313 --> 13:35.315
They didn't care about Al.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.775
They sure as shit
don't like you.

13:36.775 --> 13:37.817
They think you're crazy.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.194
You don't need me
tellin' you that.

13:39.194 --> 13:40.153
You can feel it.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.946
But you got a card to play.

13:41.946 --> 13:45.033
Something that'll force 'em
to see the power you got.

13:45.617 --> 13:46.868
Al's shipment.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.412
The new drug.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.499
It's what he woulda wanted.

13:53.416 --> 13:54.668
To see you take over.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.753
Keep his dream alive, you know?

13:59.881 --> 14:02.801
You think you know
what's best for me, hmm?

14:03.843 --> 14:05.303
You think you know what I need?

14:06.388 --> 14:08.306
How are you any different
than those pricks in there?

14:08.306 --> 14:10.058
That ain't what
I was saying, Sofia--

14:10.058 --> 14:12.227
Very, very convenient

14:12.227 --> 14:14.688
that, all of a sudden,
you're on my side.

14:14.688 --> 14:15.980
Will you look at that?

14:15.980 --> 14:16.898
Right?

14:17.899 --> 14:18.900
My little helper.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.986
- Alright.
- Fucking desperate.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.698
You are scrambling for
whatever dignity you have left,

14:24.698 --> 14:27.033
and you're hoping
I will save you.

14:27.659 --> 14:28.785
Not gonna happen.

14:29.411 --> 14:31.287
I don't owe you a fuckin' thing.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.164
No, you're right. You don't.

14:34.624 --> 14:35.667
I owe you.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.052
<i>Fuck 'em all.</i>

14:46.052 --> 14:47.429
Trying to push me out?

14:48.179 --> 14:50.140
I was Carmine Falcone's
right hand.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.474
You'd think it'd mean something.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.852
A couple'a "thank-yous"
wouldn't hurt, but no.

14:54.686 --> 14:56.271
"You've done enough, Oz."

14:56.271 --> 14:57.981
You think I've done enough, asshole?

14:57.981 --> 14:59.524
You ain't seen what I can do.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.445
None of those fucks had
the balls to do what I did.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.450
Hey, kid! Let's go!

15:10.410 --> 15:11.453
A lotta people'd be happy

15:11.453 --> 15:13.580
if their dipshit brother
turned up dead.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.831
Maybe even ecstatic.

15:15.582 --> 15:16.958
Not Sofia Falcone!

15:17.584 --> 15:19.169
So friggin' uptight.

15:21.379 --> 15:22.297
She ain't gonna stop

15:22.297 --> 15:24.257
until she's got
someone's head on a platter.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.550
Yeah. R-right.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.427
So, what's the plan with that,
by the way?

15:27.427 --> 15:29.220
- Are we gonna--
- I know what you're thinkin'.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.764
We can't kill her.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.265
Oh. No, I wasn't--

15:32.265 --> 15:34.893
She wants an inside man,
I'm gonna give her one.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.146
Otherwise, I ain't got no shot

15:38.146 --> 15:39.856
at getting my hands
on Al's shipment, you know?

15:41.733 --> 15:43.860
Jesus, Vic! I said no cilantro!

15:43.860 --> 15:45.862
- It's fuckin' everywhere!
- Shit, I'm sorry.

15:45.862 --> 15:48.615
Might as well shove a bar
of goddamn soap in my mouth.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.742
Girls are on their way.
Start pickin'.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.833
<i>Since the seawall's collapse,</i>

15:58.833 --> 16:00.794
<i>crime has spiked
all over Gotham.</i>

16:00.794 --> 16:03.463
<i>Going up by a whopping 42%.</i>

16:03.463 --> 16:05.590
<i>Don't forget
the rolling power outages.</i>

16:05.590 --> 16:07.550
<i>This city and the system
are broken.</i>

16:07.550 --> 16:09.844
<i>And I doubt the mayor-elect
has the guts to fix it.</i>

16:09.844 --> 16:11.721
<i>They're letting psychos
out of Arkham now.</i>

16:11.721 --> 16:13.473
<i>- You hear about this?
- The Hangman.</i>

16:13.473 --> 16:15.350
<i>She was technically exonerated.</i>

16:15.350 --> 16:17.268
<i>- I don't care.</i>
- Wait. Leave it on.

16:17.268 --> 16:18.978
<i>Sofia Falcone
is a serial killer.</i>

16:18.978 --> 16:21.439
<i>Seven women. And that's just
who we know about.</i>

16:26.945 --> 16:28.613
You ever heard
of the Blue Heron?

16:28.613 --> 16:30.407
- No.
- It was a club.

16:31.408 --> 16:33.868
You know, it was <i>the</i> Falcone
hangout back in the day,

16:33.868 --> 16:35.203
and I was a bar-back.

16:35.203 --> 16:37.539
One day, this guy Pinchy
rolls in,

16:37.539 --> 16:39.040
says he's so impressed
with the way

16:39.040 --> 16:40.959
that I been takin' care
of everybody,

16:40.959 --> 16:42.544
he wants me to be his driver.

16:42.544 --> 16:45.171
Only problem was...
I couldn't drive.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.840
Right, so... so what'd you do?

16:47.340 --> 16:48.258
What'd I do?

16:50.176 --> 16:52.595
I took the goddamn job, kid.
What do you think?

16:52.595 --> 16:55.515
And this is on a Friday,
and I start on Monday.

16:57.183 --> 17:00.645
So, over the weekend,
I stole myself an old Buick.

17:00.645 --> 17:03.064
I drove it around
the Eastside like a maniac

17:03.064 --> 17:05.650
till I landed it in a ditch
next to the Sprang River.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.819
But I fuckin' learned, Vic.

17:08.486 --> 17:12.157
And on Monday, I became
Pinchy Rovegno's driver.

17:13.575 --> 17:14.576
Where is he now?

17:14.576 --> 17:16.619
- Who?
- The, uh...

17:17.996 --> 17:21.124
Pinchy. What, uh...
What happened to him?

17:21.124 --> 17:22.625
Ah, well.

17:22.625 --> 17:26.212
A few months later, Carmine
caught him talkin' to the Feds.

17:27.255 --> 17:28.590
Yeah, so Pinchy got popped.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.592
But Carmine saw somethin' in me.

17:30.592 --> 17:32.218
Thought I was worth
keepin' around.

17:33.762 --> 17:35.138
And the rest is history.

17:38.266 --> 17:40.268
Welcome, ladies!
I'm glad you could make it.

17:40.268 --> 17:41.311
Hey, Alice.

17:41.311 --> 17:43.772
Whoa, is that a new coat?
Very furry.

17:43.772 --> 17:45.774
- Hi, baby.
- Hey, Cin, Rox.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.567
- Hello.
- Everybody, this is Vic.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.777
Vic, everybody.

17:48.777 --> 17:50.403
There's my girl. Hey.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.905
- You alright?
- Yeah, yeah.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.239
Long day, tough day.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.908
- It's good you're here.
- Yeah?

17:54.908 --> 17:56.409
Let's put on some tunes.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.162
I'm asking
how much you got left.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.039
And I told you. Nothing.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.291
It's a goddamn drought
out there.

18:03.291 --> 18:04.709
Bullshit. Bullshit.

18:05.835 --> 18:06.920
You owe me, man.

18:09.339 --> 18:10.632
Take it up with The Riddler.

18:26.648 --> 18:28.733
Rough night, Detective?

18:30.985 --> 18:33.279
You gotta be kidding me.
I-I-I...

18:36.658 --> 18:40.829
No. I'm sorry,
but all respect, no.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.038
No, no.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.252
You used to work for my father.

18:47.252 --> 18:49.587
Half the force worked
for your father, you know.

18:49.587 --> 18:52.590
But you were particularly...
dependable,

18:52.590 --> 18:54.509
especially at finding
snakes in the grass.

18:55.552 --> 18:58.221
Right... until you became
a Drophead.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.348
Well, that's insulting.

19:00.348 --> 19:01.641
I don't think we need to--

19:02.851 --> 19:05.061
A gift, for your condition.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.398
You wanna do 'em now?

19:09.357 --> 19:10.650
You can do 'em now.

19:15.739 --> 19:16.865
Oh yeah.

19:21.202 --> 19:25.206
Four hours ago, the Maronis
hijacked a Falcone transport

19:25.206 --> 19:26.750
heading for Robbinsville.

19:27.542 --> 19:30.253
I need to know how they came
to have that information.

19:30.253 --> 19:33.089
And you're coming to me
instead of your Family? Why?

19:34.883 --> 19:36.926
Oh, you think
it was an inside job.

19:37.969 --> 19:41.181
That's something I don't know
if I'd feel comfortable...

19:46.478 --> 19:47.979
I'll need discretion.

19:47.979 --> 19:50.148
Let me see what I can dig up.

19:50.148 --> 19:51.232
Great.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.237
Hey, everybody. Tonight...

19:57.030 --> 19:59.991
Tonight went fuckin' sideways.
There's no easy way to say it.

19:59.991 --> 20:02.160
The Maronis came at us,
but we held our own.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.704
We spilled their goddamn blood
in the streets, too. Right?

20:04.829 --> 20:05.997
- Right!
- Yeah!

20:05.997 --> 20:07.832
Okay, so, I say
we save our anger.

20:07.832 --> 20:09.876
We keep it right in here,

20:09.876 --> 20:12.337
'cause the Maronis started
something they don't know what.

20:12.337 --> 20:14.047
- They'll fuckin' see.
- That's fuckin' right.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.800
So here's to our friends
who ain't so lucky tonight.

20:19.719 --> 20:20.804
Rest well.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.557
Hey, Vic, get over here.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.475
Rox...

20:26.643 --> 20:28.687
This is the guy
who fucked up the taco order.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.940
Vic, Roxy here
is a successful entrepreneur

20:31.940 --> 20:33.817
in the camming industry.

20:33.817 --> 20:36.361
Wow, okay. So you're a camgirl.

20:36.361 --> 20:38.947
Whoa, easy, Romeo.
You can't afford her.

20:38.947 --> 20:40.490
I do mostly fetish stuff.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.033
Domination.

20:42.826 --> 20:44.160
Sometimes I work with cake.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.912
You got a sweet tooth, Vic?

20:48.164 --> 20:50.250
- Gonna leave you to it.
- All right.

21:00.468 --> 21:02.053
Where are you from?

21:02.053 --> 21:04.597
Yeah, I'm from... I'm...

21:04.597 --> 21:08.101
I'm... from Cr...

21:10.145 --> 21:12.272
Crown Point.
I'm from Crown Point.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.149
My cousin lived over there.
She said it's like

21:14.149 --> 21:16.317
a no-man's-land now
or something.

21:17.068 --> 21:19.821
I mean, they lost everything.

21:20.864 --> 21:22.157
What about you?

21:29.456 --> 21:30.290
So...

21:31.458 --> 21:32.751
How do you know Oz?

21:36.171 --> 21:37.839
I... I work for him.

21:38.923 --> 21:39.883
Really?

21:39.883 --> 21:40.925
Yeah, I'm...

21:41.718 --> 21:42.886
I'm his driver.

21:42.886 --> 21:43.928
Yeah.

22:04.449 --> 22:05.492
Yeah?

22:11.122 --> 22:12.540
Baby, can we talk?

22:12.540 --> 22:14.125
It's gonna have to wait, doll.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.919
Got a lot of shit
I'm dealing with.

22:18.630 --> 22:20.507
You killed Alberto Falcone.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.426
That's why you needed my alibi,
isn't it?

22:27.222 --> 22:29.349
You're putting me
and my girls at risk.

22:31.059 --> 22:32.602
That's not part of the deal.

22:34.104 --> 22:35.814
Say something.

22:35.814 --> 22:38.441
Eve, sweetheart, there's
all kinds of things I can say,

22:38.441 --> 22:40.819
but what matters is,
ain't nothin' to be afraid of.

22:41.444 --> 22:44.030
Look, I got a file
on Johnny Viti.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.657
Once Luca gets his eyes on that,

22:45.657 --> 22:47.659
that prick weasel Viti's
gonna take the fall

22:47.659 --> 22:49.911
for the whole fuckin' thing.

22:49.911 --> 22:51.830
The Falcone underboss?

22:51.830 --> 22:53.248
He's untouchable.

22:53.248 --> 22:54.499
No one's untouchable.

22:54.499 --> 22:55.875
Then neither are you.

23:09.139 --> 23:10.348
Hey, look at me.

23:11.474 --> 23:12.350
Look at me.

23:13.143 --> 23:14.519
You bet on the right horse.

23:15.603 --> 23:17.897
And I ain't gonna be on my own
enjoyin' the spoils.

23:18.648 --> 23:19.983
I'm gonna open up another club.

23:19.983 --> 23:22.110
It's gonna be swankier
than the Iceberg Lounge,

23:22.110 --> 23:23.653
your girls for entertainment.

23:24.362 --> 23:26.656
I slip these pics to Luca
at the funeral tomorrow,

23:26.656 --> 23:28.533
and it's baby blue skies, doll.

23:28.533 --> 23:29.868
You just gotta trust me.

23:35.582 --> 23:36.750
Come here.

23:40.837 --> 23:42.088
There she is.

23:42.881 --> 23:45.425
You're playing a dangerous game
with this Family, Oz.

23:45.425 --> 23:46.718
Oh, yeah?

23:46.718 --> 23:49.804
You think I want Sofia Falcone
knocking on my door?

23:51.348 --> 23:53.767
Women like me, we got
enough targets on our backs.

23:53.767 --> 23:56.686
And I'm tellin' you,
I know what I'm doin'.

23:58.021 --> 23:59.522
You seen me through worse,

24:00.482 --> 24:02.442
and I always come out
the other side,

24:03.318 --> 24:04.611
better than before.

24:06.154 --> 24:07.197
Trust me.

24:09.324 --> 24:11.868
There ain't nothin' about
Sofia Falcone I can't handle.

24:26.049 --> 24:27.175
Fuck.

25:03.211 --> 25:04.879
I appreciate the gesture,

25:04.879 --> 25:06.589
but this is too much.

25:06.589 --> 25:08.341
Ah, come on, doll. You--

25:10.802 --> 25:11.636
Yeah?

25:13.263 --> 25:14.639
I'll be right there.

25:18.268 --> 25:19.477
Everything okay?

25:19.477 --> 25:21.104
Yeah, yeah, just work.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.249
Hey, Ma.

25:42.625 --> 25:44.002
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

25:44.002 --> 25:45.712
I just went for a walk.

25:46.254 --> 25:47.881
- Okay.
- This guy.

25:47.881 --> 25:50.342
This guy.
He's got nothin' better to do

25:50.342 --> 25:52.510
than waste your goddamn time.

25:52.510 --> 25:53.511
Come here.

25:59.267 --> 26:00.185
<i>Qué pasó?</i>

26:00.852 --> 26:01.811
Hey.

26:03.521 --> 26:04.898
You're a nurse, right?

26:07.317 --> 26:08.526
Do you need anything?

26:08.526 --> 26:10.528
Why does everybody
keep asking me that?

26:35.929 --> 26:37.305
Oh, so you're a doctor now, too?

26:37.806 --> 26:40.016
I don't pay you
for your medical advice, Cesar.

26:40.934 --> 26:42.102
Jesus.

26:49.818 --> 26:50.735
Alright?

26:53.947 --> 26:55.031
Vic, show him out.

27:01.663 --> 27:02.747
God bless you.

27:02.747 --> 27:04.207
Thanks a lot.

27:59.929 --> 28:01.056
Come on.

28:15.195 --> 28:16.196
You gotta help me up.

28:16.905 --> 28:19.032
All right.

28:23.286 --> 28:24.329
There you go.

28:32.879 --> 28:34.547
You promised me, Oswald.

28:35.799 --> 28:37.467
I deserve a better life.

28:38.343 --> 28:41.262
I don't wanna be cooped up
in this shitty house no more.

28:41.262 --> 28:42.889
I know, Ma. I know.

28:43.598 --> 28:45.100
I won't be here forever.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.434
None of us will.

28:46.434 --> 28:48.103
You know, but we got time.

28:48.103 --> 28:49.437
You just gotta be patient.

28:49.437 --> 28:51.356
Yeah, tell it to my headstone.

28:51.356 --> 28:53.608
Jesus.
Don't start with that shit.

28:54.484 --> 28:56.569
Alright. I'm workin' on it.

29:02.867 --> 29:05.578
If my son is a nothing,
what am I?

29:11.459 --> 29:14.129
Oz. The...

29:14.963 --> 29:16.297
funeral's starting.

29:18.633 --> 29:20.802
Go, go, go, go. You go.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.012
- You sure?
- Yeah.

29:23.138 --> 29:24.347
Get outta here.

29:31.062 --> 29:32.063
Oswald...

29:33.231 --> 29:34.399
Yeah, I know, Ma.

29:35.567 --> 29:36.818
I won't let you down.

29:56.171 --> 29:57.213
Come on!

30:02.385 --> 30:04.054
Send her back!

30:04.054 --> 30:07.182
- Send her back! Send her back!
- Hang the Hangman!

30:07.182 --> 30:09.225
Send her back! Send her back!

30:09.225 --> 30:10.727
Falcones are fascists!

30:10.727 --> 30:13.104
Hey, Luca. I got something
you're gonna wanna--

30:13.104 --> 30:15.065
- Mr. Falcone.
- Thanks.

30:16.441 --> 30:17.442
Prick.

30:32.374 --> 30:37.837
Send her back! Send her back!

30:49.140 --> 30:50.392
Not a fan of crowds?

30:52.435 --> 30:54.813
Just needed a minute away
from the spectacle.

30:56.106 --> 30:57.607
Lotta ass-kissin' going on.

30:57.607 --> 30:59.109
Real nice service though.

31:00.402 --> 31:01.861
Didn't see you in there.

31:03.113 --> 31:04.572
I didn't know you were lookin'.

31:06.491 --> 31:07.617
I was in the back.

31:09.577 --> 31:11.746
Thinkin' about how much
Al woulda hated it.

31:12.664 --> 31:13.957
Yeah, he would've left early.

31:14.958 --> 31:16.418
Found a better party.

31:17.627 --> 31:18.461
Yeah.

31:27.595 --> 31:29.973
We didn't have a service
for my brothers.

31:32.142 --> 31:34.227
My ma said she didn't wanna deal
with the pity.

31:35.478 --> 31:37.188
Well, my ma, she...

31:37.188 --> 31:38.565
she wouldn't get outta bed.

31:39.274 --> 31:40.358
For weeks.

31:41.693 --> 31:42.777
Maybe a month.

31:43.862 --> 31:46.156
I tried all kindsa shit
to get her up and goin' but...

31:47.907 --> 31:49.200
you know, nothin' took.

31:51.578 --> 31:53.872
Then one night, outta the blue,
she came to me.

31:53.872 --> 31:55.498
She was all dolled up.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.045
"Oswald, we're going out,"
she says.

32:00.045 --> 32:01.338
I was fuckin' thrilled.

32:03.006 --> 32:05.467
She took me to a jazz club
on the Eastside.

32:05.467 --> 32:06.634
Monroe's.

32:07.510 --> 32:10.597
Yeah, it's the first time
I ever heard live music.

32:10.597 --> 32:11.598
Whoa!

32:13.224 --> 32:14.517
We danced all night.

32:16.353 --> 32:17.395
You and your mom?

32:18.063 --> 32:19.397
That's what we did.

32:19.397 --> 32:21.149
How we celebrated 'em, you know.

32:21.149 --> 32:22.108
Jack and Benny.

32:23.151 --> 32:24.694
They woulda fuckin'
loved it, too.

32:25.528 --> 32:28.073
Anyway, after that,
she started gettin' outta bed.

32:28.073 --> 32:30.075
She went back to work.
She took care of me.

32:32.243 --> 32:34.412
What do you think it was
that changed for her?

32:35.080 --> 32:37.916
I'd like to think it was me,
but I dunno.

32:39.209 --> 32:41.336
She died a few years back.
I never asked.

32:43.254 --> 32:46.466
Shit like this, the pain of it,
you gotta be careful,

32:47.175 --> 32:49.260
'cause it'll eat you alive
if you let it.

32:51.971 --> 32:53.932
It's helluva lot more fun
to dance.

32:59.521 --> 33:00.397
Ms. Falcone.

33:02.065 --> 33:03.233
There's a call for you.

33:05.235 --> 33:06.653
We should get to the house.

33:11.074 --> 33:12.742
Listen, what I said before,

33:14.202 --> 33:15.036
I meant.

33:16.538 --> 33:17.664
Excuse me.

33:22.502 --> 33:24.462
The detective says
he's got something.

33:45.692 --> 33:48.987
No, no. Wait, wait. Right there.

33:52.115 --> 33:53.074
Ta-da.

33:55.243 --> 33:56.870
Alright. This is Ervad.

33:56.870 --> 33:59.122
He's one of the Maronis
who lifted your Drops.

33:59.122 --> 34:02.125
He will perk up
once the morphine wears off.

34:02.125 --> 34:03.960
What are we supposed to do
with him?

34:03.960 --> 34:05.378
It's my brother's memorial.

34:05.378 --> 34:08.006
You said you wanted answers,
I brought you answers.

34:08.715 --> 34:09.966
In the flesh.

34:11.593 --> 34:14.054
You better hurry up,
'cause he ain't gonna last long.

34:22.479 --> 34:24.189
Take him to the basement.
Quietly.

34:24.898 --> 34:27.025
When he wakes up, find me.

34:30.236 --> 34:31.696
<i>You inflated your position.</i>

34:31.696 --> 34:34.074
Said you had the inside track
with Luca.

34:34.657 --> 34:36.284
But now, the Falcones snatched

34:36.284 --> 34:37.911
one of our men
out of the hospital.

34:37.911 --> 34:40.288
And you didn't say
a motherfuckin' word.

34:40.288 --> 34:42.332
- We shoulda been warned.
- Taj.

34:46.378 --> 34:47.712
This ain't Luca.

34:48.755 --> 34:51.424
Trust me. He don't tie his shoes
without lookin' both ways.

34:52.300 --> 34:54.594
It's gotta be Sofia Falcone,
acting on her own.

34:55.303 --> 34:57.138
Chick just got outta Arkham,
so she's a little...

34:57.138 --> 34:58.640
A Falcone is a Falcone.

34:59.474 --> 35:01.643
You should know
all their movements.

35:01.643 --> 35:03.395
Otherwise you have
no value to us.

35:04.229 --> 35:05.313
You broke your word.

35:05.313 --> 35:08.400
And that is not something
our family tolerates.

35:08.400 --> 35:10.652
It is how we have survived
this long.

35:11.277 --> 35:13.530
Whoa, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!

35:14.114 --> 35:15.281
Goddammit, just listen.

35:18.743 --> 35:20.537
My pocket. My fuckin' pocket.

35:21.913 --> 35:23.498
My jacket pocket!

35:24.541 --> 35:25.792
Let's see what he has.

35:34.384 --> 35:35.760
What am I looking at?

35:36.636 --> 35:39.889
Johnny Viti is fuckin'
Luca Falcone's wife.

35:39.889 --> 35:42.517
They been doin' it for years.
You're lookin' at the proof.

35:43.351 --> 35:46.021
That's just the cherry on top.
I got all kinds of dirt.

35:46.771 --> 35:47.939
Lots of it.

35:48.773 --> 35:50.650
We can squeeze 'em one by one.

35:52.110 --> 35:54.446
We want our man back.

35:54.446 --> 35:55.447
Yeah, of course.

35:56.072 --> 35:56.990
Me too.

35:57.866 --> 35:59.617
Gimme his name. I'll find him.

36:00.243 --> 36:01.619
Ervad Hakimi.

36:01.619 --> 36:03.204
You met him at Blackgate.

36:03.913 --> 36:04.956
And I suggest you hurry,

36:04.956 --> 36:07.584
'cause if the Falcones
get him to talk,

36:07.584 --> 36:09.627
he'll have a lot to say
about you.

36:35.945 --> 36:37.822
I can't believe she's out.

36:47.791 --> 36:49.125
This is crazy.

36:49.918 --> 36:52.253
She's become unhinged.

36:55.840 --> 36:58.093
She's fucking crazy.

37:09.020 --> 37:11.356
It's gotta be Sofia
running her own game.

37:11.356 --> 37:13.817
We could be drivin'
to our deaths right now.

37:13.817 --> 37:15.485
Sh-should we turn around?

37:15.485 --> 37:17.487
The only way outta this
is through, kid.

37:17.487 --> 37:20.365
Nadia took the pictures,
but Viti's still our mark.

37:20.365 --> 37:21.783
Red Mercedes, okay?

37:21.783 --> 37:23.576
That's the car
you're lookin' for.

37:23.576 --> 37:25.995
- Yeah, I don't--
- And just so we're clear,

37:25.995 --> 37:27.706
you're gonna plant the jewels
in Viti's car

37:27.706 --> 37:28.873
while I find Ervad.

37:29.624 --> 37:30.500
All these people,

37:30.625 --> 37:32.293
there's only a couple spots
they can keep him.

37:32.293 --> 37:34.921
Yeah, Oz, look,
I-I-I want to help.

37:34.921 --> 37:37.257
I-I just got
a-a-a couple of questions.

37:37.257 --> 37:39.175
Hey, hey, hey.
Look at me. Look at me.

37:39.175 --> 37:41.553
We pull this off,
Viti takes the fall,

37:41.553 --> 37:43.138
we're one step closer
to the top.

37:43.138 --> 37:45.390
We're not just gonna walk away
outta fear. Right, chief?

37:46.474 --> 37:48.476
- That's right.
- Fuck yeah, right.

37:49.644 --> 37:51.771
You feel alive, Vic? Huh?

37:51.771 --> 37:53.732
- Feel your heart beating?
- Mm-hmm.

37:54.357 --> 37:56.359
Good. Good.
Let's keep it that way, huh?

38:15.337 --> 38:16.254
What's he saying?

38:16.254 --> 38:17.881
<i>Ervad's still out cold.</i>

38:21.426 --> 38:23.219
Thanks for coming.

38:23.219 --> 38:24.804
Good to see you.

38:30.518 --> 38:32.771
He doesn't look too good,
but I got my eye on him.

38:32.771 --> 38:33.688
<i>Well, get him up.</i>

38:33.688 --> 38:35.523
<i>I need to know
who killed my brother.</i>

38:35.523 --> 38:36.816
Of course, Ms. Falcone.

38:54.751 --> 38:56.378
That's alright. Keep talkin'.
I already know.

38:56.378 --> 38:58.213
- Oz.
- Already know what?

38:58.213 --> 38:59.464
Don't bullshit me, Milos.

38:59.464 --> 39:01.591
I lost good men and nearly got
my own head shot off.

39:01.591 --> 39:04.010
You should've told me you had
one of those scumbags here.

39:04.010 --> 39:05.303
What?

39:05.303 --> 39:06.221
Really, Johnny?

39:06.221 --> 39:07.806
Who ya got in the basement?

39:08.348 --> 39:09.432
I been in this Family years.

39:09.432 --> 39:11.601
You're gonna trust one
of Sofia's guys over me?

39:11.601 --> 39:13.353
It's bullshit. Bullshit.

39:17.691 --> 39:18.733
Come on.

39:23.780 --> 39:25.865
<i>Alberto, Sofia...</i>

39:25.865 --> 39:27.492
<i>I'm gonna beat you!</i>

39:27.492 --> 39:28.451
<i>Come here.</i>

39:38.712 --> 39:41.131
<i>Look at me. Smile!</i>

39:42.966 --> 39:44.551
<i>- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year.</i>

39:45.343 --> 39:47.512
<i>Have a great year.
It's gonna be the best.</i>

40:01.901 --> 40:03.903
Sofia! Oh my God!

40:05.530 --> 40:07.449
It's so nice to see you.

40:07.449 --> 40:08.950
You too, Carla.

40:10.577 --> 40:12.078
You look the same.

40:12.078 --> 40:14.873
I like your dress.
You always had such great style.

40:18.335 --> 40:21.296
Do you remember all those
wild nights at Lake Como?

40:21.296 --> 40:25.342
Getting drunk, hanging out
with those horny Italian boys?

40:25.342 --> 40:26.343
Yeah.

40:27.093 --> 40:28.595
We got into some trouble
for that.

40:28.595 --> 40:30.638
Yeah, but it was worth it.

40:30.638 --> 40:32.557
You know, I still go to Italy
every summer.

40:33.141 --> 40:34.642
We should plan a girls' trip.

40:35.352 --> 40:36.853
A girls' trip.

40:36.853 --> 40:39.731
Yeah, that could be... fun.

40:41.149 --> 40:42.192
Mama!

40:42.192 --> 40:44.194
They have cake. Can I have cake?

40:44.194 --> 40:45.111
Who's this?

40:45.111 --> 40:46.863
I'm Gia.

40:46.863 --> 40:49.866
Hi, Gia. I'm your mom's cousin.

40:50.450 --> 40:51.576
Gia.

41:00.710 --> 41:02.253
Aren't you pretty.

41:03.505 --> 41:06.841
Uh-oh, your barrette's loose.

41:06.841 --> 41:08.968
- Oh, I can fix that--
- I got it.

41:13.723 --> 41:15.183
There you go.

41:17.018 --> 41:18.937
She's a real cutie, Carla.

41:18.937 --> 41:20.355
Yeah...

41:20.355 --> 41:22.023
Make sure
you keep her protected.

41:22.816 --> 41:24.359
A young woman in this family...

41:25.193 --> 41:26.569
Might not end well for her.

41:28.613 --> 41:29.614
Come on.

41:29.614 --> 41:30.740
Sofia.

41:33.743 --> 41:35.120
Luca wants to see you.

41:51.845 --> 41:53.096
The hell are you doing?

41:53.096 --> 41:54.639
That's my boss's car!

41:54.639 --> 41:56.683
I-I-I work here.
The alarm was going off.

41:56.683 --> 41:58.143
Taking something outta the car?

41:59.144 --> 42:00.729
- What? No.
- What's in the bag?

42:00.729 --> 42:01.771
Hey!

42:02.856 --> 42:03.898
Hey!

42:07.152 --> 42:08.778
It's un-fucking-believable.

42:08.778 --> 42:10.405
You and Sofia,
you really thought

42:10.405 --> 42:11.906
you could keep this
from the Family.

42:45.398 --> 42:46.399
Hey, Ervad.

42:50.236 --> 42:51.613
Ervad.

42:51.613 --> 42:53.073
Wake up, pal.

42:53.073 --> 42:54.616
Nadia sent me.

42:55.325 --> 42:56.284
Can you hear me?

42:57.035 --> 42:58.328
Help...

42:59.162 --> 43:00.288
Help me.

43:00.288 --> 43:01.915
Yeah, yeah.
That's what I'm here for.

43:02.457 --> 43:04.167
But I can't just walk you
outta here.

43:04.167 --> 43:06.044
You're gonna have to do
something for me first.

43:06.628 --> 43:08.672
There's this chick.
She's got an ax to grind.

43:08.672 --> 43:10.715
She's gonna roll in here,
she's gonna ask you

43:10.715 --> 43:12.759
if you been workin'
with someone on the inside.

43:13.843 --> 43:15.720
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look at me.

43:16.429 --> 43:18.723
I need you to say the name
Johnny Viti.

43:18.723 --> 43:21.017
<i>He</i> killed Alberto Falcone.

43:21.017 --> 43:23.937
Listen to me. Johnny Viti.

43:24.771 --> 43:26.898
Alright?
That's the name you give 'em.

43:27.440 --> 43:29.275
Then I help you, alright?

43:29.275 --> 43:30.694
Alright.

43:30.694 --> 43:33.863
- Johnny... Viti...
- There it is.

43:38.243 --> 43:40.036
Vic. How we lookin'?

43:40.036 --> 43:42.539
Oz, I-I-I couldn't do it.

43:42.539 --> 43:44.874
<i>I couldn't get the jewels
into Viti's car.</i>

43:44.874 --> 43:46.376
The fuck you talkin' about?

43:46.376 --> 43:47.544
<i>They're lookin' for me.</i>

43:47.544 --> 43:50.296
Security, they s-s-s...

43:50.296 --> 43:52.716
<i>Where are you?
Where's the fuckin' jewels?</i>

43:52.716 --> 43:54.884
I had to run, okay?
But I still got the pouch.

43:54.884 --> 43:56.428
I c-- I c-c--

43:56.428 --> 43:58.054
<i>I can't--</i>

43:58.054 --> 43:59.597
<i>God, tell me what to do!</i>

44:03.309 --> 44:05.228
Oz, I can say it.

44:06.271 --> 44:07.480
I'll say his name...

44:08.356 --> 44:09.691
Viti...

44:14.029 --> 44:15.447
Plan's changed, pal.

44:18.867 --> 44:20.618
I gotta give 'em
somethin' solid,

44:20.618 --> 44:22.162
or they'll be lookin' at me.

44:23.246 --> 44:24.414
I can't have that.

45:17.425 --> 45:19.386
We all gotta make
sacrifices, pal.

45:32.315 --> 45:34.359
I told you to come to me,
not go behind my back.

45:34.359 --> 45:36.319
Well, I did go to you,
and you told me to weep

45:36.319 --> 45:37.904
about my dead brother
and do nothing.

45:37.904 --> 45:39.280
There is a traitor
in this Family,

45:39.280 --> 45:40.323
and I brought you someone

45:40.323 --> 45:41.908
who can give us
an actual fucking answer.

45:41.908 --> 45:43.493
No one comes in.

45:51.876 --> 45:52.794
Fuck.

45:52.794 --> 45:54.254
Jesus Christ.

45:56.006 --> 45:57.173
I warned you.

45:58.258 --> 46:01.302
You get me everyone
from the Drops transport.

46:01.302 --> 46:03.388
Nobody leaves.

46:12.814 --> 46:15.316
- Oz.
- Hey, Dom. You seen Viti?

46:15.316 --> 46:16.276
Let's go.

46:16.276 --> 46:17.569
What are you doin'?

46:21.281 --> 46:22.949
Close the doors.

46:22.949 --> 46:24.367
What's goin' on?

46:24.367 --> 46:26.077
Get them inside.

46:26.077 --> 46:27.912
Search everyone for weapons.

46:32.834 --> 46:34.294
We're looking for a knife.

46:34.294 --> 46:35.962
Nick, what the fuck is goin' on?

46:35.962 --> 46:37.964
Someone iced a Maroni
in the basement.

46:53.938 --> 46:55.065
The fuck!

46:55.065 --> 46:57.400
- Come on!
- Fuck you!

46:58.193 --> 47:00.945
You touch me again, I will have
that goddamn hand cut off.

47:05.241 --> 47:06.409
The fuck you lookin' at?

47:06.409 --> 47:07.619
It was you, wasn't it?

47:08.495 --> 47:10.288
You sent us there
to get massacred.

47:10.288 --> 47:11.706
What the Maronis give ya, huh?

47:11.706 --> 47:13.416
You better watch your mouth,
you fucking gimp.

47:13.416 --> 47:15.293
Fuck your mother, you dirty rat!

47:15.293 --> 47:16.795
- Fuck you!
- Fuck your mother!

47:16.795 --> 47:18.755
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

47:18.755 --> 47:20.757
...your face off,
you motherfucker!

47:20.757 --> 47:23.301
- Let him go! Let him go!
- Hey!

47:23.301 --> 47:24.302
Get the fuck off me!

47:24.302 --> 47:26.346
Hey! Everybody back in line!

47:27.639 --> 47:29.599
One of you is a traitor.

47:31.935 --> 47:33.728
Feeding information
to the fuckin' enemy.

47:33.728 --> 47:34.896
That ends tonight.

47:34.896 --> 47:37.816
I will not tolerate a rat.

47:37.816 --> 47:38.733
He's clean.

47:44.114 --> 47:46.991
- Got him. It was in his pocket.
- That's not mine.

47:46.991 --> 47:48.535
That's not f-- Get off of me.

47:48.535 --> 47:50.870
Ms. Falcone, I swear to God,
that is not mine.

47:51.955 --> 47:54.249
- It was you.
- That's not true.

47:54.249 --> 47:55.792
You were there
with him that night.

47:55.792 --> 47:58.294
- You killed him.
- I didn't. I would never.

47:58.294 --> 47:59.671
- Give me your gun.
- Sofia.

47:59.671 --> 48:01.798
- Give me your fucking gun.
- Please, listen to me.

48:01.798 --> 48:03.258
- I would never do that.
- Give me your gun.

48:03.883 --> 48:05.927
I have been nothing
but loyal to you!

48:05.927 --> 48:07.429
Give me your fucking gun!

48:24.362 --> 48:26.614
<i>You should have left him
for me.</i>

48:26.614 --> 48:29.075
- Sofia, it's done--
- He was mine to kill.

48:29.075 --> 48:31.286
- For Alberto.
- I made the call.

48:38.293 --> 48:40.420
Maybe it's time for you
to leave Gotham.

48:41.129 --> 48:42.172
What?

48:42.172 --> 48:44.841
We got to do what's best...
for you.

48:45.884 --> 48:47.177
For your safety.

48:49.054 --> 48:52.015
Italy is beautiful
this time of year.

48:53.892 --> 48:56.061
Didn't you spend your summers
there, in Lake Como?

49:04.277 --> 49:07.280
You're right, Uncle Luca...

49:07.280 --> 49:10.533
And I could use the time away.

49:10.533 --> 49:11.743
Yeah.

49:12.494 --> 49:13.745
It'll be good for you.

49:16.873 --> 49:18.083
Sweetheart.

49:20.543 --> 49:21.628
Come in.

49:21.628 --> 49:22.837
We're done here.

49:43.650 --> 49:45.568
Fuckin' Johnny Viti
givin' me orders now?

49:45.568 --> 49:46.945
Sayin' I gotta clean up?

49:48.363 --> 49:49.698
Was supposed to be him
in this grave,

49:49.698 --> 49:51.074
not these two schmucks.

49:53.410 --> 49:54.494
Oh, man.

49:55.995 --> 49:56.871
Shit!

49:59.416 --> 50:02.002
Lay down, where you belong.

50:04.713 --> 50:06.339
Oz... look.

50:06.339 --> 50:07.549
Lay down! Now!

50:11.219 --> 50:12.262
God.

50:17.934 --> 50:19.519
How does it feel, Vic, huh?

50:20.103 --> 50:22.147
Nah! Hey, hey.
Don't close your eyes.

50:22.147 --> 50:23.523
Look at them. Remember this.

50:23.523 --> 50:26.109
This is what happens
when you choke, ya understand?

50:26.109 --> 50:27.777
Dead's a one-way street, Vic.

50:27.777 --> 50:30.447
You know how close I got
to getting popped tonight?

50:30.447 --> 50:31.448
'Cause you fucked up?

50:33.116 --> 50:35.076
Then I gotta plant the blade
and the jewels...

50:35.076 --> 50:36.536
Lotta work for me, Vic.

50:36.536 --> 50:39.622
- A lotta work.
- Look, I'm-I'm-I'm sorry, okay?

50:39.622 --> 50:40.665
- I mean it.
- You know what?

50:40.665 --> 50:41.875
Fuck apologizing.

50:42.542 --> 50:45.045
You wanna survive?
You gotta adapt.

50:45.045 --> 50:46.671
Respond to the environment,
the situation,

50:46.671 --> 50:48.715
gotta think on your feet,
you gotta be quick.

50:48.715 --> 50:50.383
Otherwise, this is what happens.

50:51.176 --> 50:53.678
Whatever Carmine threw at me,
I delivered on.

50:53.678 --> 50:55.638
Every goddamn time!

50:57.307 --> 50:59.309
- You get what I'm saying?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

50:59.309 --> 51:00.435
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

51:08.943 --> 51:10.570
Ah, fuck it. Alright, come on.

51:10.570 --> 51:12.280
Get up, get up. Gimme your hand.

51:18.953 --> 51:20.538
There ain't no playbook
for this shit, kid.

51:21.539 --> 51:23.500
I saw somethin' in you.
Maybe I was wrong.

51:23.500 --> 51:24.793
You tell me.

51:24.793 --> 51:26.670
Maybe you ain't cut out
for this life.

51:27.253 --> 51:28.088
You know?

51:29.255 --> 51:30.548
Who the fuck is calling me now?

51:34.636 --> 51:36.137
Cover the bodies.

51:38.598 --> 51:39.766
Hey, Sofia.

51:40.725 --> 51:41.685
How ya doin'?

51:43.395 --> 51:44.354
Uh-huh.

51:45.271 --> 51:46.356
Uh-huh.

52:19.431 --> 52:20.682
He killed my brother.

52:21.599 --> 52:23.601
A man I trusted,
working for them.

52:25.687 --> 52:26.563
Why?

52:27.272 --> 52:28.231
For what?

52:31.568 --> 52:32.819
Some diamonds.

52:33.528 --> 52:35.238
These were
in Castillo's apartment.

52:35.238 --> 52:37.115
It's what Alberto went to get
the night he died.

52:38.575 --> 52:40.076
As an investment in our future,

52:40.869 --> 52:42.120
in our new drug.

52:42.871 --> 52:44.622
We were gonna run
the Family together.

52:45.623 --> 52:47.250
But Berto was taken from me.

52:48.793 --> 52:51.171
And I refuse
to let these old fucking men

52:51.171 --> 52:52.797
push me aside again,
like I'm nothing.

52:52.797 --> 52:54.466
So, I'm gonna take
from them now.

52:55.050 --> 52:57.093
And I'm gonna force them
to their knees.

53:01.056 --> 53:02.307
It should be fun.

53:06.186 --> 53:07.437
What do you say, Oz?

53:08.438 --> 53:09.481
You in?

53:11.816 --> 53:12.942
Let's dance.
