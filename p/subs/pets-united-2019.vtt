Ronaldo can't help it.
Ronaldo has to be first.

13:53.958 --> 13:57.833

For his mama. For his <i>ragazza.</i>

13:58.166 --> 14:00.291

You're so embarrassing, Ronaldo.

If you weren't in love
with your mama, Ronaldo,

you'd date yourself.

14:13.875 --> 14:17.125

38:13.791 --> 38:15.708
Well, well.

38:15.875 --> 38:19.416
Roger, the Thief of Robo City.

38:19.500 --> 38:22.541
What an honor to finally meet you.

38:22.625 --> 38:25.458
You must be Brian Longfinger.

38:25.791 --> 38:27.458
Beezer mentioned you once.

38:27.583 --> 38:31.875
Yes, my fingers are everywhere.

38:31.958 --> 38:35.708
As are my eyes and ears.

38:37.416 --> 38:39.416
You're in grave danger.

38:39.791 --> 38:41.291
He's on your trail.

38:41.375 --> 38:43.708
Who? Sheriff Bill?

38:43.791 --> 38:46.458
No, not the old Bill.

38:46.541 --> 38:50.666
Something far greater
is threatening the city.

38:52.166 --> 38:55.083
[Brian] It all began many years ago.

38:55.625 --> 38:59.291
To build the city,
the wetlands were drained.

38:59.375 --> 39:03.291
Forests were cleared and rivers dammed.

39:03.916 --> 39:07.208
[Brian] <i>And thus, the city grew and grew,</i>

39:07.291 --> 39:09.875
<i>consuming all in its wake.</i>

39:10.875 --> 39:14.583
The wild animals were driven
from their habitats.

39:14.750 --> 39:18.125
Some were granted a cage at the zoo.

39:18.416 --> 39:19.916
As I was.

39:20.875 --> 39:23.708
[Brian] But most were simply cast out.

39:24.250 --> 39:28.458
For the sake of the city,
a place where people and their pets

39:28.541 --> 39:31.125
could be free from cares.

39:31.583 --> 39:34.458
Robots were designed to do all the work.

39:34.541 --> 39:36.083
Slowly but surely,

39:36.166 --> 39:40.333
the inhabitants grew more
and more selfish and spoilt.

39:41.750 --> 39:44.125
[Brian] <i>And as the city
flourished and grew,</i>

39:44.208 --> 39:46.416
<i>so too did the rubbish dump,</i>

39:47.000 --> 39:49.625
<i>feeding on the inhabitants' garbage</i>

39:49.708 --> 39:52.625
<i>until it spilled out across the land</i>

39:52.708 --> 39:56.125
<i>like the tentacles of a giant squid.</i>

39:56.250 --> 39:59.458
Frank Stone, too, began to change.

39:59.958 --> 40:02.708
The genius behind Robo City

40:03.125 --> 40:05.416
grew ever more obsessive.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.791
[Brian] <i>The once friendly man
secluded himself,</i>

40:09.875 --> 40:12.625
<i>turned his back on everyone,</i>

40:12.708 --> 40:15.958
<i>even on those he loved.</i>

40:16.041 --> 40:18.708
<i>The handsome idol of Robo City</i>

40:18.791 --> 40:21.125
<i>grew pale and bony.</i>

40:21.708 --> 40:24.666
<i>Something terrible happened to him.</i>

40:24.750 --> 40:26.208
<i>And now...</i>

40:26.291 --> 40:28.916
<i>Now the city is being run</i>

40:29.541 --> 40:31.666
<i>by a monster.</i>

40:32.125 --> 40:33.500
[Brian] What happened?

40:33.583 --> 40:36.208
We all want to know and understand.

40:36.708 --> 40:39.708
Especially you, Roger.

40:39.875 --> 40:42.083
[Brian] More than anyone else,

40:42.166 --> 40:45.791
you want to know and understand.

40:45.916 --> 40:48.666
So now you are their leader.

40:48.958 --> 40:51.125
[Brian] You will be their guide.

40:51.250 --> 40:55.791
Through gloomy times
to rekindle the light.

40:56.333 --> 40:57.333
Hm...

41:00.083 --> 41:02.708
And I always thought
only pets were cuckoo.

41:03.541 --> 41:05.750
[dramatic music]

41:35.625 --> 41:36.833
It is done.

41:36.916 --> 41:40.666
The perfect world is just one step away.

41:44.750 --> 41:46.291
We're safe now.

43:09.375 --> 43:12.875
She'll probably be out
looking for me... right now.

43:12.958 --> 43:14.291
Exactly.

43:15.291 --> 43:17.875
She'll be terribly worried about me.

43:17.958 --> 43:19.166
Sure.

43:22.083 --> 43:23.291
Oh.

43:23.375 --> 43:27.083
That'll be the day
when I need pity from a stray dog.

43:28.458 --> 43:29.833
She let me down.

43:29.916 --> 43:32.750
She upped and left without me.

43:32.833 --> 43:34.083
And that's that.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.083
<i>Tutto solo</i>.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.500
All alone the hero rises.

43:41.875 --> 43:43.000
Buffoon.

43:43.583 --> 43:45.875
No one's ever said that to me before.

43:45.958 --> 43:47.625
What a feisty lady.

43:48.750 --> 43:51.791
And you? You could never understand.

43:52.375 --> 43:55.375
You're a layabout, a stray, a thief.

43:55.458 --> 43:56.958
You've never lost anything.

43:57.541 --> 44:00.333
Because you've never had anything to lose.

44:00.416 --> 44:03.041
Hm. True. I'm a stray.

44:03.125 --> 44:05.208
I've no home. No owner.

44:05.291 --> 44:07.250
No one to care for me around the clock.

44:07.333 --> 44:08.791
And I'm a thief too.

44:09.375 --> 44:10.791
I'm not proud of it.

44:11.458 --> 44:13.208
I stole to survive.

44:13.291 --> 44:14.833
There are many like me out there.

44:15.208 --> 44:17.625
[Roger] With no place to go
when it gets dark,

44:17.708 --> 44:19.041
no hope,

44:19.125 --> 44:20.750
no one to look after them.

44:21.125 --> 44:23.208
But...
[inhales]

44:23.750 --> 44:25.291
But I was not born a stray.

44:26.833 --> 44:28.208
Once, I had a home.

44:28.291 --> 44:31.458
A warm bed. The best dishes.

44:31.916 --> 44:33.166
And above all...

44:33.708 --> 44:36.750
<i>someone who loved me
more than anything.</i>

44:38.000 --> 44:39.666
We were inseparable.

44:40.583 --> 44:43.750
[Roger] <i>When he was at work,
I anxiously waited for him.</i>

44:43.833 --> 44:46.666
<i>We spent all our spare time together.</i>

44:46.750 --> 44:49.083
<i>We wandered the streets for hours,</i>

44:49.166 --> 44:51.166
<i>or we'd just play and play.</i>

44:52.583 --> 44:56.000
<i>And then, well, one day, it happened.</i>

44:56.625 --> 44:58.500
<i>I'd picked up an exciting scent.</i>

44:58.583 --> 45:00.625
<i>I was pulling at my leash,</i>

45:00.708 --> 45:03.500
<i>and, and suddenly I was loose.</i>

45:04.083 --> 45:07.166
<i>Wherever I looked, there were
just strange feet and legs.</i>

45:07.250 --> 45:11.541
<i>People everywhere,
but I was completely alone.</i>

45:14.250 --> 45:16.791
<i>I looked for my owner all night long.</i>

45:18.125 --> 45:19.541
<i>But he was gone.</i>

45:21.541 --> 45:24.625
And over the years, I started
forgetting where I came from.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.041
Instead, I learned where I belong.

45:27.125 --> 45:28.708
On the street.

45:29.250 --> 45:31.750
And that's where I learned
to look after myself.

45:32.458 --> 45:34.791
It wasn't easy, but I managed.

45:38.125 --> 45:39.541
[sniffles]

45:40.000 --> 45:42.125
So he was a pet like us.

45:42.208 --> 45:43.708
Think twice, stupid.

45:43.791 --> 45:45.875
We're strays now, like him.

45:46.416 --> 45:47.375
Oh.

45:48.041 --> 45:50.541
But we got a roof over our head.

45:50.625 --> 45:52.291
We've got each other.

45:52.375 --> 45:55.833
And we've got... Fixit!

1:08:13.208 --> 1:08:14.791
Uh...
[sniffing]

1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:18.458
Hmm...

1:08:19.250 --> 1:08:21.750
[eerie music]

1:08:22.416 --> 1:08:24.250

1:08:31.291 --> 1:08:32.416
[whimpers]

1:08:37.541 --> 1:08:39.208
Mission completed, Master.

1:08:39.333 --> 1:08:40.666
Well, well, well...

1:08:41.541 --> 1:08:43.208
Who've we got here?

1:08:43.583 --> 1:08:45.916
The robot with human feelings.

1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:47.458
[chuckles nervously]

1:08:47.750 --> 1:08:49.083
Boris.

1:08:51.166 --> 1:08:54.625
How did this horrible thing
escape the crusher?

1:08:55.666 --> 1:08:58.125
You were supposed
to get rid of all the copies

1:08:58.208 --> 1:09:00.416
of this good-for-nothing series.

1:09:01.333 --> 1:09:03.833
You didn't feel sorry for him, did you?

1:09:04.750 --> 1:09:07.375
What a stupid idea.

1:09:07.458 --> 1:09:09.541
A robot with emotions.

1:09:09.625 --> 1:09:11.166
How ridiculous.

1:09:11.250 --> 1:09:14.375
Emotions disrupt
the perfect course of things.

1:09:14.583 --> 1:09:17.666
They are impure and full of errors.

1:09:18.250 --> 1:09:20.208
[grunts]

1:09:20.291 --> 1:09:21.208

1:09:26.833 --> 1:09:28.500
-Oh...

1:09:29.458 --> 1:09:31.166
-[chuckles]
-Hey...

1:09:32.250 --> 1:09:35.541
What's up with your head?
You're no sheriff.

1:09:35.625 --> 1:09:38.541
You're junk. Get out of my sight.

1:09:38.625 --> 1:09:39.458
Oh.

1:09:39.541 --> 1:09:41.041
That's not fair.

1:09:41.791 --> 1:09:44.041
-Oh.
-And now to you.

1:09:44.166 --> 1:09:46.583
You came here to kill your master.

1:09:46.708 --> 1:09:49.541
[Mayor] You're a brave
but useless little guy.

1:09:49.625 --> 1:09:52.250
And now all that's left for you is...

1:09:52.416 --> 1:09:54.000
The Jaw.

1:09:54.208 --> 1:09:55.291
No.

1:10:00.833 --> 1:10:01.750
Ew.

1:10:05.333 --> 1:10:08.666
[ominous music]

1:10:23.083 --> 1:10:24.125
Huh?

1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:49.458
[Bill] Comrades!

1:10:52.500 --> 1:10:54.416
Sheriff Bill?

1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:56.541
They are not our enemy.

1:11:00.250 --> 1:11:02.875
I was the head of the Stray Police

1:11:02.958 --> 1:11:06.291
and charged with
keeping scrap off the streets.

1:11:06.625 --> 1:11:09.250
But now, I'm just like you.

1:11:09.333 --> 1:11:11.583
A discarded robot.

1:11:11.666 --> 1:11:13.333
[Bill] And I'm proud of it.

1:11:15.333 --> 1:11:17.791
So you and these strays

1:11:17.875 --> 1:11:20.625
are now under my protection.

1:11:20.708 --> 1:11:22.250

1:11:31.958 --> 1:11:34.625
Come on. Hurry up about it.

1:11:34.708 --> 1:11:36.750
[Bob whimpers]

1:11:38.625 --> 1:11:39.583
Ha...

1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:41.333
Oh, I get it.

1:11:41.833 --> 1:11:45.208
You really have got a soft spot
for the little guy.

1:11:45.291 --> 1:11:46.458
Loser.

1:11:46.791 --> 1:11:48.250
I'll show you.

1:11:48.916 --> 1:11:50.000
[mumbles]

1:11:50.083 --> 1:11:53.833
But first, we say goodbye to our friend.

1:11:53.916 --> 1:11:57.541
Sweet dreams and bon voyage.

1:11:58.125 --> 1:11:59.541
Ah! Ugh.

1:11:59.625 --> 1:12:01.791
[grunts]

Huh!

[Roger groaning]

1:12:47.875 --> 1:12:49.416
Bob! Uh...

[gasps, sighs]

1:13:04.458 --> 1:13:06.583

Bob! No!

1:13:08.958 --> 1:13:11.000

1:13:14.833 --> 1:13:16.000
Roger.

1:13:23.750 --> 1:13:25.166
[Roger pants]

1:13:25.250 --> 1:13:26.583
[Roger] Oh, no!

1:13:28.166 --> 1:13:29.958
You have to jump off, my friend.

1:13:30.041 --> 1:13:32.666
-Never.
-You can't save me.

1:13:32.750 --> 1:13:34.083
I'm too heavy.

1:13:34.416 --> 1:13:36.416
And I'm not made of flesh and blood.

1:13:36.500 --> 1:13:37.625
I'm metal.

1:13:37.708 --> 1:13:39.416
I can't escape the magnet.

1:13:39.500 --> 1:13:41.541
I'm not going to abandon you.

1:13:41.625 --> 1:13:45.958
You're everything I got.
We are friends for life, remember?

1:13:46.958 --> 1:13:49.708
It's been a long and wonderful day.

1:13:50.041 --> 1:13:51.416
I'm grateful for that.

1:14:02.166 --> 1:14:03.208
[gasps]

1:14:05.208 --> 1:14:06.291
Huh!

1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:20.083
Belle... What a prima ballerina.

1:14:38.625 --> 1:14:40.458
Phew. That was a close one.

1:14:54.541 --> 1:14:55.666
[Belle] Hold tight.

1:14:58.208 --> 1:14:59.166
[Roger] Hey.

1:14:59.250 --> 1:15:02.083

Ah!

1:15:27.625 --> 1:15:29.083
[grunting]

1:15:34.041 --> 1:15:35.875
You can do it, Ronaldo.

1:15:35.958 --> 1:15:37.666
Huh? Hm.

Oh, oh. Hey!

1:15:55.625 --> 1:15:57.166
[laughs]

1:15:57.250 --> 1:16:00.458
It's Ronaldo.
[laughs proudly]

1:16:03.375 --> 1:16:04.750
Thank you, Belle.

1:16:06.125 --> 1:16:07.083

Huh?

1:16:29.583 --> 1:16:31.791
[dramatic music]

1:16:33.875 --> 1:16:36.541
Come on. I dare you.

1:16:39.833 --> 1:16:41.708
Oh.
[chuckles]

1:16:42.041 --> 1:16:42.958
Oh.

1:16:43.041 --> 1:16:44.916
You obey your master.

1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:48.916
But tomorrow, you'll be
discarded like we were.

1:16:49.166 --> 1:16:53.583
[Bill] Prized robots and scrap,
we are all alike.

1:16:53.791 --> 1:16:56.958
The same energy flows through our veins.

1:16:57.041 --> 1:16:59.291
We are brothers and sisters.

1:16:59.666 --> 1:17:03.791
And our enemy is not down here,
but up there!

1:17:07.333 --> 1:17:10.000
[dramatic music]

1:17:17.750 --> 1:17:20.416
What a useless waste of time.

Bye-bye.

1:18:55.750 --> 1:18:59.791
-Belle, that was the--
-Yes, that was quite a long day.

1:19:00.208 --> 1:19:02.166
But it was the best day of my life.

1:19:02.750 --> 1:19:03.791
[sighs]

1:19:03.916 --> 1:19:06.041
For one day we were all...

1:19:06.125 --> 1:19:07.583
Mangy strays.

1:19:07.666 --> 1:19:11.541
We had no protection,
but we weren't afraid.

1:19:11.708 --> 1:19:13.791
We were without a Mama.

1:19:13.875 --> 1:19:16.708
But we were as free as pirates.

1:19:16.791 --> 1:19:19.166
We were all like Roger and Bob.

1:19:19.250 --> 1:19:22.208
Without them, we wouldn't have made it.

1:19:22.291 --> 1:19:25.166
Thank you, but it's not over yet.

1:19:31.125 --> 1:19:32.083
Hm.

Huh? Uh...

1:19:37.666 --> 1:19:38.625
[gasps]

1:19:41.041 --> 1:19:42.458
Is it possible?

1:19:44.041 --> 1:19:45.375
Is it a dream?

1:19:45.958 --> 1:19:47.708
Is it really you?

1:19:47.791 --> 1:19:50.000
-[Frank] Roger? My Roger?

1:19:50.125 --> 1:19:53.541

1:19:58.250 --> 1:20:00.625

And thank you, Bob.

Oh.

1:20:26.375 --> 1:20:28.666
[clanking]

1:20:31.625 --> 1:20:34.500
No power on earth can stop me.

1:20:34.875 --> 1:20:37.416
We are too perfect to be defeated.

1:20:39.708 --> 1:20:43.458
A piece of discarded junk
and a miserable stray.

1:20:43.541 --> 1:20:46.041
-[growls]
-[Mayor] The scum of my city.

1:20:46.125 --> 1:20:48.416
You dare to come here?

1:20:48.583 --> 1:20:49.791
-[beeps]
-Huh?

1:20:50.583 --> 1:20:52.208
[grumbles]

1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:55.833
Let me down, you freak!

1:20:55.916 --> 1:20:57.250
[Frank] Oh, he will.

1:20:58.000 --> 1:20:59.291
Later.

1:20:59.958 --> 1:21:01.875
Uh, you wanna say goodbye, Bob?

1:21:01.958 --> 1:21:03.625
With pleasure.

1:21:03.708 --> 1:21:05.791

1:21:10.833 --> 1:21:14.416
Oh... Interesting turn of events.

1:21:17.833 --> 1:21:20.250
Boris will now let you down.

1:21:31.166 --> 1:21:34.333
Bon voyage. And sweet dreams.

1:22:07.750 --> 1:22:10.333

I built this wall to keep
the city safe from the wild.

1:22:24.083 --> 1:22:25.750
[Frank] Thinking about it now,

1:22:26.375 --> 1:22:28.500
it's probably the other way round.

1:22:31.125 --> 1:22:32.416
[gasps]

1:22:33.125 --> 1:22:35.541
Does anyone know what that is?

1:22:36.708 --> 1:22:38.625
[Roger] Our ancestors called it...

1:22:39.041 --> 1:22:40.250
nature.

The spider?

1:22:52.291 --> 1:22:54.250
Not fast enough for old Slomo, my friend.

at this side of the wall.

There are things out there

1:23:11.958 --> 1:23:14.625
So much space outside our cages.

At least in theory.

1:23:36.458 --> 1:23:37.875
But the cages?

1:23:37.958 --> 1:23:41.791
You always end up in one cage or another.

1:23:42.541 --> 1:23:46.250
But when it's your home,
you don't see the bars.

1:23:48.041 --> 1:23:49.208

Have you not thought
about getting your nose done?

1:24:19.583 --> 1:24:23.291
I think it's big enough.

-Hm.

Why do I bother asking?
