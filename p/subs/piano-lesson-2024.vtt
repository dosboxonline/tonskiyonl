See, that's why I know
Berniece ain't gonna sell that piano.

15:28.916 --> 15:31.832
He tried to get her to sell it
to help him start his church.

15:31.833 --> 15:33.625
Sent the man around and everything.

15:34.791 --> 15:35.790
[Boy Willie] What man?

15:35.791 --> 15:38.249
Some white fella who going around
to colored people's houses

15:38.250 --> 15:39.957
looking to buy musical instruments.

15:39.958 --> 15:41.457
He'd buy anything.

15:41.458 --> 15:45.249
Drums, guitars, harmonicas, pianos.

15:45.250 --> 15:49.165
Avery sent him past here.
He looked at that piano, got excited.

15:49.166 --> 15:51.290
Offered her a nice price.

15:51.291 --> 15:54.375
She turned him down,
got on Avery for sending him past.

15:54.875 --> 15:55.833
[Boy Willie] Hm.

15:56.583 --> 15:58.583
[wistful music playing]

16:09.250 --> 16:11.166
[Berniece] It's always something.

16:12.125 --> 16:13.291
Now, what the...

16:14.416 --> 16:15.666
[mutters]

16:18.375 --> 16:20.375
[wistful music continues]

16:22.208 --> 16:23.500
[snores]

16:30.291 --> 16:31.291
[Boy Willie moans]

16:43.791 --> 16:45.083
[music fades]

17:01.166 --> 17:02.375
[door opens]

17:03.375 --> 17:04.416
[door closes]

17:05.250 --> 17:06.749
[water dripping]

17:06.750 --> 17:08.833
[ominous music playing]

17:22.625 --> 17:23.708
[wind whistling]

17:26.625 --> 17:27.790
[light switch clicks]

17:27.791 --> 17:30.415
[screaming] Doaker! Doaker!

17:30.416 --> 17:32.040
[screaming continues]

17:32.041 --> 17:32.957
Doaker!

17:32.958 --> 17:35.207
- Doaker!
- Berniece? Berniece?

17:35.208 --> 17:36.707
[whimpering]

17:36.708 --> 17:37.707
[Doaker] Berniece?

17:37.708 --> 17:40.124
Lord, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:40.125 --> 17:43.582
- [Lymon] Hey, what's going on?
- [Doaker] It's all right. I got you.

17:43.583 --> 17:45.666
Come on. Come on. Sit down. Sit down.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.374
Come on. What is it?

17:47.375 --> 17:48.915
- Sutter--
- What's the matter?

17:48.916 --> 17:50.832
Sutter's standing up there in the hall.

17:50.833 --> 17:53.082
- [Doaker] Boy Willie?
- [Boy Willie] Ain't nobody up here.

17:53.083 --> 17:54.249
Boy Willie!

17:54.250 --> 17:56.374
[footsteps running down stairs]

17:56.375 --> 17:58.666
[Boy Willie] Hey, Doaker.
What's wrong with her?

17:59.750 --> 18:01.165
Hey, Berniece, what's wrong?

18:01.166 --> 18:03.749
She says she seen Sutter's ghost.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.749
[Boy Willie] Seen what?
She ain't seen no Sutter.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.165
Boy, he was standing right there.

18:07.166 --> 18:09.415
[Boy Willie] That's in Berniece's head.
Nobody up there.

18:09.416 --> 18:11.957
- Go on up there, Doaker.
- I take your word for it.

18:11.958 --> 18:16.082
Berniece talking about what she seen,
and she said Sutter's ghost in the hall.

18:16.083 --> 18:17.332
She ain't just made that up.

18:17.333 --> 18:19.290
She up there dreaming.
She ain't seen no ghost.

18:19.291 --> 18:22.124
[Lymon] You want a glass of water?
Get a glass of water, Boy Willie.

18:22.125 --> 18:24.207
She don't need water.
She ain't seen nothing.

18:24.208 --> 18:26.415
Go up there and look.
Ain't nobody up there but Maretha.

18:26.416 --> 18:28.582
- [Doaker] Let Berniece tell it.
- [Boy Willie] Ain't stopping her.

18:28.583 --> 18:30.082
- [Doaker] Go on.
- [Berniece] I just--

18:30.083 --> 18:32.624
I come out my room to come back down here,

18:32.625 --> 18:35.290
and... and Sutter
was standing there in the hall.

18:35.291 --> 18:36.374
[breathing shakily]

18:36.375 --> 18:37.665
[Boy Willie] What he look like?

18:37.666 --> 18:40.791
He look like Sutter.
Look like he always look.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.957
Sutter couldn't find his way
from Big Sandy to Little Sandy.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.332
How he gonna find his way
all the way up here to Pittsburgh?

18:47.333 --> 18:48.957
Sutter ain't even heard of Pittsburgh.

18:48.958 --> 18:51.082
Let Berniece finish.
I wanna hear what she got to say.

18:51.083 --> 18:53.874
Just... just... just standing there
with a blue suit on.

18:53.875 --> 18:56.290
[Boy Willie] Man never left Marlin County
when he was living.

18:56.291 --> 18:59.249
He gonna come all the way up here
now that he's dead?

18:59.250 --> 19:00.374
Now, go on, Berniece.

19:00.375 --> 19:02.707
If Berniece seen him
like she think she seen him,

19:02.708 --> 19:03.957
she'd still be running.

19:03.958 --> 19:05.750
Go on. Don't pay Boy Willie no mind.

19:08.333 --> 19:09.666
Did he have on a hat?

19:10.166 --> 19:11.957
[Berniece] Just had on that blue suit.

19:11.958 --> 19:15.833
He just stood there looking at me,
calling Boy Willie's name.

19:17.083 --> 19:18.457
What he calling my name for?

19:18.458 --> 19:20.582
I believe you pushed him in the well.

19:20.583 --> 19:22.499
[Boy Willie] Now what kind of sense
that make?

19:22.500 --> 19:25.332
[laughs] You telling me I'mma go out
and hide in the weeds

19:25.333 --> 19:28.165
with... with all them dogs and things
he got around there?

19:28.166 --> 19:29.457
I'mma go out and hide

19:29.458 --> 19:33.707
and wait till I catch him looking down
his well just right,

19:33.708 --> 19:36.040
then I'mma run over and push him in?

19:36.041 --> 19:38.290
A great big old 340-pound man.

19:38.291 --> 19:39.707
Well, what he call your name for?

19:39.708 --> 19:41.874
He was bending over,
looking down his well, woman.

19:41.875 --> 19:44.874
How he know who pushed him?
Could have been anybody.

19:44.875 --> 19:47.165
Where was you
when Sutter fell down his well?

19:47.166 --> 19:48.333
Where was Doaker?

19:49.291 --> 19:51.290
Me and Lymon
was over in Stoner County. Tell her.

19:51.291 --> 19:54.165
The Ghosts of the Yellow Dog got Sutter.
That's what happened to him.

19:54.166 --> 19:56.624
[Berniece] You can talk all that Ghosts
of the Yellow Dog stuff if you want.

19:56.625 --> 19:57.874
I know better.

19:57.875 --> 20:02.165
Ghosts of the Yellow Dog pushed him.
That's what the people say.

20:02.166 --> 20:04.250
[unsettling music playing]

20:06.250 --> 20:08.207
- [man 1] That's him.
- [man 2] I see him.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.249
There.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.749
[Lymon] <i>They found him in his well,
and all the people say</i>

20:11.750 --> 20:14.916
it must be the Ghosts of the Yellow Dog,
just like all them other men.

20:16.291 --> 20:18.249
[Boy Willie] Come talking about
he looking for me.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.582
That ain't nothing but in Berniece's head.

20:20.583 --> 20:22.999
Ain't no telling what she's liable
to come up with next.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.624
Boy Willie, I want you and Lymon
to go ahead and leave my house.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.040
Just go on somewhere.

20:27.041 --> 20:29.499
You bring trouble with you
everywhere you go.

20:29.500 --> 20:32.083
If it wasn't for you,
Crawley would still be alive.

20:36.416 --> 20:37.500
Crawley what?

20:39.541 --> 20:41.790
I had nothing to do
with Crawley getting killed.

20:41.791 --> 20:44.165
Crawley three time seven.
He had his own mind.

20:44.166 --> 20:47.332
Just go on and leave. Let Sutter
go somewhere else looking for you.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.415
[Boy Willie] I'm leaving!

20:48.416 --> 20:51.791
Soon as we sell them watermelons.
Other than that, I ain't going nowhere.

20:52.708 --> 20:54.624
- Hell.
- [Berniece groans]

20:54.625 --> 20:55.958
I just got here.

20:59.666 --> 21:02.000
Talking about Sutter looking for me.

21:03.916 --> 21:07.874
Sutter was looking for that piano.
That's what Sutter was looking for.

21:07.875 --> 21:11.208
He had to die to find out
where that piano was at.

21:12.750 --> 21:14.708
If I was you, I'd get rid of it.

21:15.666 --> 21:17.332
That's the way
to get rid of Sutter's ghost.

21:17.333 --> 21:18.415
Get rid of that piano.

21:18.416 --> 21:19.999
I want you and Lymon

21:20.000 --> 21:22.124
to take all of this confusion
out of my house.

21:22.125 --> 21:24.665
Tell her, Doaker.
What kind of sense that make?

21:24.666 --> 21:25.874
I told you, Lymon,

21:25.875 --> 21:28.207
soon as Berniece see me,
she was gonna start something.

21:28.208 --> 21:29.207
Didn't I tell you that?

21:29.208 --> 21:31.624
Now she done made up
that story about Sutter

21:31.625 --> 21:33.374
just to tell me to leave her house.

21:33.375 --> 21:36.207
Hell, I ain't going nowhere
till we sell them watermelons.

21:36.208 --> 21:38.374
Well, why don't you go out there
and sell 'em, then?

21:38.375 --> 21:40.458
Sell 'em and go on back.

21:41.583 --> 21:43.291
We waiting till the people get up.

21:44.541 --> 21:47.707
Boy Willie say if you get out too early,
wake the people up,

21:47.708 --> 21:50.832
they get mad at you
and won't buy nothing from you.

21:50.833 --> 21:54.165
[Doaker] Well, you won't be waiting long.
You done let the sun catch up with you.

21:54.166 --> 21:55.875
This the time folk here be getting up.

22:00.500 --> 22:03.125
Come on, Doaker. Walk up there with me.

22:03.791 --> 22:07.666
Let me get Maretha up and get her started.
I gotta get ready myself.

22:08.625 --> 22:09.666
Boy Willie,

22:10.916 --> 22:13.040

and sell them watermelons,

22:13.041 --> 22:15.540
and you and Lymon leave my house.

22:15.541 --> 22:17.625
[emotional music playing]

22:20.166 --> 22:23.625
You see Sutter up there,
you tell him I'm down here waiting on him.

22:30.083 --> 22:32.083
[emotional music continues]

22:36.791 --> 22:38.458
[Lymon] What if she see him again?

22:39.125 --> 22:41.541
That's just all in her head.
Ain't no ghost up there.

22:43.333 --> 22:45.333
[Doaker humming]

22:47.333 --> 22:49.457
Ah! [screams playfully]

22:49.458 --> 22:50.915
[both laughing]

22:50.916 --> 22:53.125
- [Doaker] You too quick for me.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.250
Hey, sugar!

22:58.125 --> 23:00.333
[laughs happily] Come on, give me a hug!

23:01.166 --> 23:03.666
Come on, give Uncle Boy Willie a hug.
Don't be shy.

23:04.375 --> 23:08.207
[chuckles] Look at her, Doaker.
She done got bigger. Ain't she got big?

23:08.208 --> 23:09.915
Oh yeah. She getting up there.

23:09.916 --> 23:10.958
[Boy Willie moans]

23:11.458 --> 23:13.625
- How you doing, sugar?
- Fine.

23:14.375 --> 23:15.750
You remember me, don't you?

23:16.500 --> 23:18.832
It's your Uncle Boy Willie

23:35.625 --> 23:40.041
When you gonna come down South and see me?
Uncle Boy Willie gonna get him a farm.

23:40.541 --> 23:43.957
Gonna get him a great big old farm.

23:43.958 --> 23:46.624
Come down there,

I seen my mama do that.

23:50.833 --> 23:52.624

23:52.625 --> 23:56.375

You just take him by his neck...

24:04.166 --> 24:05.707
You got good eating then. [exclaims]

24:05.708 --> 24:07.374
[Boy Willie laughs]

24:07.375 --> 24:08.666
[Doaker chuckles]

24:10.500 --> 24:11.500

24:21.291 --> 24:23.041
Well, come on. Play something for me.

24:24.750 --> 24:25.708
Go ahead.

25:08.208 --> 25:09.833
Wait. Hold on. That ain't it.

25:10.708 --> 25:11.750
[grunts]

25:12.625 --> 25:14.625

25:18.833 --> 25:19.750
See that?

25:20.833 --> 25:22.125
See what I'm doing?

25:23.500 --> 25:25.458
That's what you call the boogie-woogie.

25:25.958 --> 25:28.000
See, you can get up and dance to that.

25:28.500 --> 25:31.957
[laughs] That's how good it sound.
It'll hold you up.

25:31.958 --> 25:33.999
Any dance you wanna do,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.041
You see that? You see how it go?

25:38.500 --> 25:39.708
Ain't nothing to it.

25:42.125 --> 25:43.790
[laughs] Go on. You do it.

25:43.791 --> 25:45.332
I got to read it on the paper.

25:45.333 --> 25:47.708
You don't need to read no paper.
Just do like this here.

25:48.208 --> 25:49.250
[Berniece] Maretha!

25:49.750 --> 25:52.416
You get up here and get ready to go

25:53.291 --> 25:54.374
I got to go.

25:54.375 --> 25:55.583
[Boy Willie chuckles]

25:56.666 --> 26:00.749
Your mama tell you about that piano?
You know how them pictures got on there?

26:00.750 --> 26:04.040
She say it's just always been like that
since she got it.

26:04.041 --> 26:06.957
You hear that, Doaker?
You up here in the house with Berniece.

26:06.958 --> 26:08.874
I ain't got nothing to do with that.

26:08.875 --> 26:11.290
I don't get in the way
of Berniece raising her.

26:11.291 --> 26:12.291
[Boy Willie] Hmm.

26:13.458 --> 26:15.791
Tell your mama
to tell you about that piano.

26:17.166 --> 26:18.083
Hmm.

26:21.041 --> 26:22.041
You feel that?

26:23.916 --> 26:26.125
That's your family. Your blood.

26:26.708 --> 26:29.250
Now, you ask her
how them pictures got on there.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.915
If she don't tell you, I'll tell you.

26:31.916 --> 26:33.333
[Berniece] Maretha!

48:25.625 --> 48:28.874
And when Sutter seen the piano
with all these carvings on it...

48:28.875 --> 48:29.915
[exclaims]

48:29.916 --> 48:31.540
...he got mad!

48:31.541 --> 48:33.457
He didn't ask for all this,

48:33.458 --> 48:36.124
but wasn't nothing he could do about it.

48:36.125 --> 48:39.707
But when Miss Ophelia seen it,
oh, well, she got excited.

48:39.708 --> 48:43.624
Now, she had her piano
and her niggers too.

48:43.625 --> 48:45.332
She took back to playing on it.

48:45.333 --> 48:48.915
Played on it right on up
to the day she died. All right.

48:48.916 --> 48:51.207
Now, our brother Boy Charles,

48:51.208 --> 48:54.958
that's Berniece and Boy Willie's daddy,

48:55.666 --> 48:57.666
he the oldest of us three boys.

48:58.333 --> 49:01.416
He'd have been 57 if he had lived.

49:01.958 --> 49:05.083
Died in 1911 when he was 31 years old.

49:06.500 --> 49:10.749
Boy Charles talked about that piano
all the time.

49:10.750 --> 49:12.790
Couldn't get it off his mind.

49:12.791 --> 49:16.666
Two, three months go by,
he'd be talking about it again.

49:17.416 --> 49:20.958
He'd be talking about
taking it out of Sutter's house.

49:21.541 --> 49:26.290
He said it was the story
of our whole family,

49:26.291 --> 49:28.374
and long as Sutter had it,

49:28.375 --> 49:29.665
he had us.

49:29.666 --> 49:31.583
Said we still in slavery.

49:32.583 --> 49:34.749
Me and Wining Boy tried
to talk him out of it,

49:34.750 --> 49:36.416
but it wouldn't do any good.

49:36.958 --> 49:39.916
Soon as he'd quiet down about it,
he'd start up again.

49:41.541 --> 49:43.832
We seen where he wasn't gonna
get his mind off it,

49:43.833 --> 49:46.624
so on 4th of July, 1911,

49:46.625 --> 49:49.832
while Sutter was at the picnic
what the county give every year...

49:49.833 --> 49:51.707
[dramatic music playing]

49:51.708 --> 49:53.790
[fireworks exploding]

49:53.791 --> 49:56.291
<i>...me and Wining Boy
went on down there with him,</i>

49:57.208 --> 50:01.125
<i>and we took this piano
out of Sutter's house.</i>

50:05.750 --> 50:08.583
Boy Willie couldn't have been
no more than six years old.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.624
His daddy had decided

50:12.625 --> 50:15.790
he was gonna stick around
till Sutter got back.

50:15.791 --> 50:18.250
Make it look like business as usual.

50:19.250 --> 50:22.833
I don't know what happened when Sutter
came home and found that piano gone,

50:24.041 --> 50:28.166
but somebody went up to Boy Charles' house
and set it on fire.

50:28.916 --> 50:30.957
He wasn't in there.
He must have seen 'em coming.

50:30.958 --> 50:36.000
<i>'Cause he went down
and caught the 3:57 Yellow Dog.</i>

50:37.083 --> 50:39.624
<i>He ain't know they was gonna
come down there and stop the train.</i>

50:39.625 --> 50:40.915
[horse whinnies]

50:40.916 --> 50:42.375
<i>They stopped the train,</i>

50:43.333 --> 50:48.083
<i>found Boy Charles and three of them hobos
in one of them boxcars.</i>

50:49.041 --> 50:51.041
[brakes squeal]

50:52.375 --> 50:53.207
[loud thud]

50:53.208 --> 50:55.582
[Doaker] <i>Must've got mad
when they couldn't find that piano</i>

50:55.583 --> 50:59.416
<i>'cause they set the boxcar on fire.</i>

51:00.291 --> 51:01.958
Killed everybody.

51:04.416 --> 51:06.083
Now, nobody know who done that.

51:07.166 --> 51:10.124
<i>Some folks say it was Sutter
'cause it was his piano.</i>

51:10.125 --> 51:12.207
<i>Some folks say it was Sheriff Carter.</i>

51:12.208 --> 51:15.082
<i>Some people say
it was Ed Saunders or Robert Smith,</i>

51:15.083 --> 51:18.540
but don't nobody know for sure.

51:18.541 --> 51:20.625
[dramatic music continues]

51:22.208 --> 51:27.582
It was about two months after that
that Ed Saunders fell down his well.

51:27.583 --> 51:31.750
Just upped and fell down his well
for no reason.

51:32.750 --> 51:35.874
<i>People say it was the ghosts
of them men what died in that boxcar</i>

51:35.875 --> 51:37.540
<i>pushed him in his well.</i>

51:37.541 --> 51:41.457
<i>And they started calling them
the Ghosts of the Yellow Dog.</i>

51:41.458 --> 51:43.416
That's how all that got started.

51:44.208 --> 51:47.500
And that's why me and Wining Boy say

51:48.166 --> 51:52.416
Berniece ain't gonna sell that piano.

51:53.291 --> 51:55.833
'Cause her daddy died over it.

51:58.083 --> 51:59.583
[Boy Willie] All that's in the past.

52:03.208 --> 52:04.541
If my daddy

52:05.625 --> 52:10.916
had seen where he could have traded
that piano... in for some land of his own,

52:12.375 --> 52:14.125
it wouldn't be sitting up here now.

52:15.208 --> 52:18.041
He spent his whole life
farming somebody else's land.

52:20.250 --> 52:21.500
I ain't gonna do that.

52:23.416 --> 52:25.082
See, he couldn't do no better.

52:25.083 --> 52:27.374
When he come along,
he ain't had nothing to build on.

52:27.375 --> 52:29.458
His daddy ain't had nothing to give him.

52:30.500 --> 52:32.708
The only thing my daddy had to give me

52:33.833 --> 52:36.915
was that piano,
and he died giving me that.

52:36.916 --> 52:40.374
I ain't gonna let it sit there and rot
without trying to do something with it.

52:40.375 --> 52:44.415
And if Berniece can't see that,
I'm gonna go and sell my half.

52:44.416 --> 52:46.124
You and Wining Boy know I'm right.

52:46.125 --> 52:49.999
Ain't nobody said nothing
about who's right and who's wrong.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.958
I'm just telling the man about the piano.

52:52.875 --> 52:58.250
I'm telling him why me and Wining Boy say
Berniece ain't gonna sell it.

52:59.625 --> 53:01.250
Can see why you say that now.

53:02.458 --> 53:05.791
I told Boy Willie
he ought to stay up here with me.

53:07.333 --> 53:08.458
[Boy Willie] You stay.

53:09.375 --> 53:10.625
I'm going back.

53:13.083 --> 53:14.875
That's what I'm gonna do with my life.

53:15.958 --> 53:18.833
Why I got to learn to do something
I don't know how to do

53:19.333 --> 53:21.125
when I already know how to farm?

53:22.166 --> 53:23.166
You stay.

53:24.875 --> 53:27.375
Make your own way
if that's what you wanna do.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.708
I'm going back
to live my life the way I wanna live it.

53:36.916 --> 53:38.333
[Boy Charles] <i>You know what this is?</i>

53:39.166 --> 53:40.583
[young Boy Willie] <i>I don't know.</i>

53:42.333 --> 53:43.707
[Boy Charles] <i>What you think it is?</i>

53:43.708 --> 53:44.791
[young Boy Willie] Dirt.

53:45.916 --> 53:47.083
[Boy Charles] Nah, son.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.208
This ain't no dirt.

53:49.708 --> 53:51.166
This here is land.

53:53.500 --> 53:55.958
- You know the difference?
- No.

53:57.875 --> 53:58.916
[Boy Charles] See, dirt...

54:00.166 --> 54:03.041
dirt'll blow away, be gone with the wind.

54:04.083 --> 54:05.083
But land...

54:05.750 --> 54:06.708
[chuckles softly]

54:07.250 --> 54:08.916
...land'll last you forever, son.

54:15.500 --> 54:17.458
Go ahead. Feel it now. Crush it.

54:18.333 --> 54:20.333
[mysterious music playing]

54:22.416 --> 54:23.416
You feel that?

54:24.541 --> 54:25.708
Feel good, don't it?

54:27.791 --> 54:29.791
[mysterious music continues]

54:44.708 --> 54:47.832
[man on radio] <i>One of the beings
walked towards me</i>

54:47.833 --> 54:50.625
<i>slowly but with intent.</i>

54:51.250 --> 54:53.249
<i>My comrades ran away in fear.</i>

54:53.250 --> 54:55.583
- [door opens]
- [Berniece] Go on and get up them stairs.

54:56.958 --> 54:59.082
- [man on radio] <i>...in a tall tree.</i>
- Is that--

54:59.083 --> 55:02.290
Lord! I... I know
that ain't Wining Boy sitting there.

55:02.291 --> 55:03.750
[Wining Boy] Hey, Berniece.

55:04.500 --> 55:06.374
You all had this planned.

55:06.375 --> 55:08.874
You and Boy Willie had this planned.

55:08.875 --> 55:11.457
[Wining Boy] I didn't know
he was gonna be here.

55:11.458 --> 55:14.665
I'm on my way down home and stopped by
to see you and Doaker first.

55:14.666 --> 55:16.874
Told that nigger,
he left here with that sack of money,

55:16.875 --> 55:19.040
we thought
he wasn't never gonna see him again.

55:19.041 --> 55:20.791
[Wining Boy] Give your uncle a hug.

55:21.375 --> 55:24.874
Boy Willie, I ain't see that truck.
Thought you was out selling watermelons.

55:24.875 --> 55:27.666
We done sold 'em all. Sold the truck too.

55:28.458 --> 55:31.415
I don't wanna go through your stuff.
I told you. Go back where you belong.

55:31.416 --> 55:34.540
Hell, I was just teasing you, woman.
You can't take no teasing?

55:34.541 --> 55:36.207
Wining Boy, when you get here?

55:36.208 --> 55:38.750
A little while ago.
I took the train from Kansas City.

55:39.250 --> 55:41.749
Let me go change my clothes,
then I'll cook you something to eat.

55:41.750 --> 55:43.999
Hey! I like the sound of that.

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
Come on, Maretha. Change your clothes
before you get 'em dirty.

55:47.500 --> 55:48.999
[Wining Boy] Maretha sure getting big.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.124
- Ain't she, Doaker?
- Mm-hmm.

55:50.125 --> 55:53.999
And just as pretty as she wanna be.
I didn't know Crawley had it in him.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.374
[laughing]

55:55.375 --> 56:00.082
Hey, Lymon, get up on the other side
of this piano. Let me see something.

56:00.083 --> 56:03.582
- Boy Willie, what is you doing?
- I wanna see how heavy this piano is.

56:03.583 --> 56:04.625
[grunts]

56:05.125 --> 56:06.374
Get up over there, Lymon.

56:06.375 --> 56:09.999
Go on and leave that piano alone.
You ain't taking it and selling it.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.124
Just as soon as I get them watermelons
off that truck.

56:12.125 --> 56:13.999
[Wining Boy]
I got something to say about that.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.332
This my daddy's piano.

56:15.333 --> 56:17.958
He ain't took it by himself.
Me and Doaker helped him.

56:19.166 --> 56:20.458
He died by himself.

56:21.458 --> 56:23.208
Where was you and Doaker at then?

56:24.291 --> 56:26.082
Don't come telling me nothing
about this piano.

56:26.083 --> 56:28.874
This me and Berniece's piano.
Am I right, Doaker?

56:28.875 --> 56:31.207
Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you right.

56:31.208 --> 56:33.082
Come on, Lymon.
Let's see if we can lift it up.

56:33.083 --> 56:36.208
Get you a real good grip
and lift it up on your end. Come on.

56:40.958 --> 56:42.958
[stirring music playing]

56:44.666 --> 56:46.082
- [Boy Willie] Ready?
- [Lymon] Ready.

56:46.083 --> 56:48.375
[jazz music playing on radio]

56:50.000 --> 56:51.124
[Boy Willie] Lift.

56:51.125 --> 56:52.582
[stirring music continues]

56:52.583 --> 56:53.499
[Boy Willie grunts]

56:53.500 --> 56:56.415
[static on radio]

56:56.416 --> 56:58.500
[stirring music continues]

57:02.000 --> 57:04.583
[Boy Willie and Lymon grunting]

57:08.500 --> 57:10.000
[static on radio]

57:11.208 --> 57:12.332
[Boy Willie] What you think?

57:12.333 --> 57:16.375
It's heavy, but you can move it.
Only it ain't gonna be easy.

57:17.791 --> 57:19.333
[Boy Willie] Wasn't that heavy to me.

57:20.541 --> 57:22.625
Okay. Let's put it back.

57:24.666 --> 57:26.208
[grunting]

57:28.250 --> 57:30.250
[stirring music continues]

57:43.291 --> 57:44.416
[Berniece] Boy Willie,

57:45.333 --> 57:47.874
you gonna play around with me
one too many times,

57:47.875 --> 57:50.207
and then God gonna bless you,
and West gonna dress you.

57:50.208 --> 57:52.041
Now set that piano back over there.

57:53.875 --> 57:55.833
- I'm trying to get me some land, woman.
- Mm-hmm.

57:56.416 --> 57:58.665
Wining Boy, you want me
to fry you up some pork chops?

57:58.666 --> 58:00.207
[Wining Boy] It sound good to me.

58:00.208 --> 58:02.833
See, now, I'm gonna tell you
the way I see it.

58:04.666 --> 58:06.999
Papa Boy Charles brought that piano
into the house.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.875
Now I'm supposed to build on
what they left me.

58:10.416 --> 58:13.165
Can't do nothing with that piano,
letting it sit up there in the house.

58:13.166 --> 58:16.790
That'd be like if I let them watermelons
sit out there and rot. I'd be a fool.

58:16.791 --> 58:21.291
Okay, now, if you say to me,
"Boy Willie, I'm using that piano."

58:21.875 --> 58:24.624
"I give out lessons on it.
That help me pay my rent."

58:24.625 --> 58:26.832
Or whatever,
then that'd be something else.

58:26.833 --> 58:29.499
I'd have to say,
"Well, Berniece using that piano."

58:29.500 --> 58:31.707
"She building on it.
Let her go on and use it."

58:31.708 --> 58:33.791
"I got to find another way
to get Sutter's land."

58:35.083 --> 58:38.665
But Doaker say you ain't touched
that piano the whole time it's been here.

58:38.666 --> 58:40.833
So why you wanna try and stand in my way?

58:41.958 --> 58:44.291
See, you just looking
at the sentimental value.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.250
See, that's good.

58:47.500 --> 58:50.957
That's all right. I take my hat off
whenever somebody say my daddy's name.

58:50.958 --> 58:54.040
But I ain't gonna be no fool
about no sentimental value.

58:54.041 --> 58:56.332
You can sit up there
and look at that piano for 100 years.

58:56.333 --> 58:59.500
It's just gonna be a piano.
You can't make more than that.

59:03.666 --> 59:05.916
Now, I wanna get Sutter's land
with the piano.

59:06.541 --> 59:11.083
I get Sutter's land, go down there
and cash the crop and get my seed.

59:11.666 --> 59:14.874
See, as long as I got the land
and the seed, I'm all right.

59:14.875 --> 59:17.333
I can always get me
a little something else.

59:18.125 --> 59:20.707
The kind of man my daddy was,
he would've understood that.

59:20.708 --> 59:22.874
Now, I'm sorry
you can't see it that way, Berniece,

59:22.875 --> 59:26.666
but that's why I'm taking that piano
out of here and selling it.

59:27.166 --> 59:28.500
Look at this piano.

59:30.166 --> 59:31.125
Look at it.

59:33.708 --> 59:37.249
Mama Ola polished this piano
with her tears

59:37.250 --> 59:39.041
for 17 years.

59:39.791 --> 59:43.833
For 17 years,
she rubbed on it till her hands bled.

59:44.625 --> 59:48.583
Then she rubbed the blood in,
mixed it with the rest of the blood on it.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.749
Every day,
God breathed life into her body.

59:52.750 --> 59:57.416
She rubbed and cleaned
and polished and prayed over it.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.791
"Play something for me, Berniece."

01:00:01.791 --> 01:00:03.500
"Play something for me, Berniece."

01:00:04.125 --> 01:00:06.458
"Play something for me, Berniece."
Every day.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.375
"I cleaned it up for you.
Play something for me, Berniece."

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:14.375
You always talking about your daddy.

01:00:14.875 --> 01:00:18.082
But you don't never stop to look at
what his foolishness cost your mama.

01:00:18.083 --> 01:00:22.625
Seventeen years' worth
of cold nights in an empty bed. For what?

01:00:24.083 --> 01:00:25.291
For a piano?

01:00:25.916 --> 01:00:27.375
For a piece of wood?

01:00:28.375 --> 01:00:30.208
To get even with somebody?

01:00:33.458 --> 01:00:34.500
I look at you,

01:00:35.833 --> 01:00:37.458
and you're all the same.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.040
You, Papa Boy Charles,
Wining Boy, Doaker, Crawley.

01:00:42.041 --> 01:00:43.249
Y'all alike.

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:45.832
All this thieving and killing.
Thieving and killing.

01:00:45.833 --> 01:00:47.082
What it ever lead to?

01:00:47.083 --> 01:00:50.332
More killing and more thieving.
I ain't never seen it come to nothing.

01:00:50.333 --> 01:00:52.499
People getting burnt up.
People getting shot.

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:55.915
People falling down their wells.
It don't never stop!

01:00:55.916 --> 01:00:58.750
Come on, now, Berniece.
Ain't no sense in getting upset.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.041
I done a little bit of stealing
here and there,

01:01:03.791 --> 01:01:05.708
but I ain't never killed nobody.

01:01:06.666 --> 01:01:09.915
I can't be speaking for nobody else.
You... you all got to speak for yourself.

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:11.583
But I ain't never killed nobody.

01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:16.540
You killed Crawley
just as sure as if you pulled the trigger.

01:01:16.541 --> 01:01:18.208
[Boy Willie] See, that's just ignorant.

01:01:18.791 --> 01:01:21.082
That's downright foolish
for you to say something like that.

01:01:21.083 --> 01:01:23.124
You ain't doing nothing
but showing your ignorance.

01:01:23.125 --> 01:01:27.082
If the nigger was here, I'd whoop his ass
for getting me and Lymon shot at.

01:01:27.083 --> 01:01:30.332
- Crawley ain't knew about that wood.
- We told the man about the wood!

01:01:30.333 --> 01:01:32.665
Ask Lymon. He knew all about the wood.

01:01:32.666 --> 01:01:36.165
He seen we was sneaking it.
Why else we gonna go out there at night?

01:01:36.166 --> 01:01:38.249
Don't tell me
Crawley ain't knew about the wood.

01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:41.583
Them fellas try to run us off it,
and Crawley tried to bully them.

01:01:42.208 --> 01:01:43.749
Me and Lymon seen the sheriff with them.

01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:46.249
We give in.
No sense getting killed over $50.

01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:49.332
- Crawley ain't knew. You stole that wood!
- [Boy Willie] We ain't stole no wood.

01:01:49.333 --> 01:01:52.915
We was hauling wood for Jim Miller
and keeping us a little bit on the side.

01:01:52.916 --> 01:01:56.833
We dumped our little bit down by the creek
till we had enough to make a load.

01:01:57.708 --> 01:02:00.874
Them fellas seen us. We figured
we better get it before they did.

01:02:00.875 --> 01:02:04.082
We got Crawley to help us load it.
We figured we'd cut him in.

01:02:04.083 --> 01:02:06.958
Crawley trying to keep the wolf
from his door. We was helping.

01:02:07.458 --> 01:02:09.750
[Lymon] Me and Boy Willie
told him about the wood.

01:02:11.791 --> 01:02:14.165
We told him some fellas
might be trying to beat us to it.

01:02:14.166 --> 01:02:18.083
He said, "Whoa.
Let me go back, get my .38."

01:02:19.166 --> 01:02:20.625
That's what caused the trouble.

01:02:23.458 --> 01:02:26.166
If Crawley ain't had that gun,
he'd still be alive today.

01:02:28.958 --> 01:02:31.916
[Lymon] We had it about half loaded
when they come up on us.

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:35.249
We seen the sheriff with 'em.
We... we tried to get away.

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:37.999
We ducked round
near that bend in the creek,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.707
but they was down there too.

01:02:39.708 --> 01:02:41.541
Boy Willie say, "Let's give in,"

01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:44.541
but Crawley pulled out his gun,
started shooting.

01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:46.749
That's when they started shooting back.

01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:48.833
[unsettling music playing]

01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:54.375
[Boy Willie] Berniece.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.333
All I know is Crawley would still be alive
if you hadn't come up there and got him.

01:03:03.458 --> 01:03:05.750
I had nothing to do
with Crawley getting killed.

01:03:06.375 --> 01:03:07.540
That was his own fault.

01:03:07.541 --> 01:03:10.374
Crawley is dead and in the ground,

01:03:10.375 --> 01:03:12.915
and you still walking around here eating.

01:03:12.916 --> 01:03:14.333
That's all I know.

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:18.999
He went off to load some wood with you
and ain't never come back.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.082
I told you, woman, I had nothing to do
with Crawley getting killed!

01:03:22.083 --> 01:03:23.375
He ain't here, is he?

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:25.915
He ain't here, hmm?

01:03:25.916 --> 01:03:28.540
- I told you I ain't responsible--
- I said he ain't here!

01:03:28.541 --> 01:03:31.374
- I don't-- Doaker, get her outta here.
- He ain't here, is he? Is he?

01:03:31.375 --> 01:03:33.249
- He ain't here!
- I done told you...

01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:35.333
[unsettling music continues]

[Berniece panting]

01:04:23.666 --> 01:04:26.125
[Berniece] Easy. It's okay. It's okay.

01:04:30.458 --> 01:04:32.458
[wistful music playing]

01:04:43.666 --> 01:04:46.166
[Doaker] Maretha scared
to sleep upstairs now.

01:04:47.125 --> 01:04:50.750
Berniece don't know,
but I seen Sutter 'fore she did.

01:04:51.333 --> 01:04:52.958
- [Wining Boy] Say what?
- [Doaker] Mm-hmm.

01:04:53.583 --> 01:04:54.915
About three weeks ago.

01:04:54.916 --> 01:04:57.415
I had just come back from down there.

01:04:57.416 --> 01:05:00.207
Sutter couldn't have been dead
more than three days.

01:05:00.208 --> 01:05:01.957
He was sitting over there at the piano.

01:05:01.958 --> 01:05:05.541
I come out to go to work.
He's sitting right there.

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:09.249
He say anything?
He say he was looking for Boy Willie?

01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:12.333
I ain't heard him say nothing.
He just sitting there.

01:05:12.916 --> 01:05:15.750
I don't believe
Boy Willie pushed him in the well though.

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:18.291
Sutter here 'cause of that piano.

01:05:18.791 --> 01:05:22.207
Berniece need to go on and sell it.
Ain't done nothing but cause trouble.

01:05:22.208 --> 01:05:26.915
I don't-- I agree with Berniece.
Boy Charles ain't took it to give it back.

01:05:26.916 --> 01:05:30.165
He took it because he figured
he had more right to it than Sutter did.

01:05:30.166 --> 01:05:33.125
If Sutter can't understand that,
that's just the way that go.

01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:36.791
Sutter dead and in the ground.
Don't care where his ghost is.

01:05:37.291 --> 01:05:39.958
He can hover around
and play on the piano all he want.

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:43.874
I wanna see him carry it out the house.
That's what I wanna see.

01:05:43.875 --> 01:05:46.165
- [laughing]
- [funky music playing]

01:05:46.166 --> 01:05:49.500
[Lymon] Two for a dollar.
Come on. Who wants some watermelon?

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:51.249
[man] I'll take five.

01:05:51.250 --> 01:05:52.165
[all clamoring]

01:05:52.166 --> 01:05:55.958
- [Lymon] Two big watermelon coming to you.
- [Boy Willie] It's a boy. Congratulations.

01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:01.790
- You picking the right ones, ain't you?
- We got two more coming. One second.

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:04.000
Watch out. That's heavy now. Be careful.

01:06:04.583 --> 01:06:06.540
- [Boy Willie] There you go. Thank you.
- All right.

01:06:06.541 --> 01:06:09.458
See, this is what we call salt.
Put that on that right there.

01:06:10.875 --> 01:06:13.207
- Take a bite. What you think?
- Mmm!

01:06:13.208 --> 01:06:16.958
One, two, three lovely ladies.

01:06:17.958 --> 01:06:19.958
[both laughing]

01:06:21.125 --> 01:06:24.541
Yo, one lady asked me, "Is they sweet?"

01:06:25.041 --> 01:06:27.374
I told her, "Lady,
where we grow these watermelons,

01:06:27.375 --> 01:06:29.082
we put the sugar in the ground."

01:06:29.083 --> 01:06:31.499
[Boy Willie laughing]
You know she believed me.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.458
Talking about,
"I've never heard that before."

01:06:35.208 --> 01:06:36.333
Look here, Lymon.

01:06:37.208 --> 01:06:40.040
See this? Look at his eyes getting big.

01:06:40.041 --> 01:06:42.582
He ain't never seen a suit like this.

01:06:42.583 --> 01:06:45.790
This is 100% silk.

01:06:45.791 --> 01:06:48.291
Go ahead. Put it on. See if it fit.

01:06:49.625 --> 01:06:50.916
[Wining Boy chuckles]

01:06:56.875 --> 01:06:57.916
Ha ha!

01:06:58.458 --> 01:07:01.332
Look at that. Feel it.

01:07:01.333 --> 01:07:03.874
[Lymon] This is nice.

01:07:03.875 --> 01:07:06.207
Feel real nice and smooth.

01:07:06.208 --> 01:07:09.000
That's a $55 suit.

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.582
That's the kind of suit
the big shots wear.

01:07:11.583 --> 01:07:15.000
You need a pistol and a pocketful of money
to wear that suit.

01:07:15.916 --> 01:07:17.957
I'll let you have it for three dollars.

01:07:17.958 --> 01:07:22.333
The women will fall out of their windows
they see you in a suit like that.

01:07:22.916 --> 01:07:25.165
Give me three dollars,
and wear it down the street

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:26.666
and get you a woman.

01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:29.708
Put the pants on.
Let me see it with the pants.

01:07:32.583 --> 01:07:35.040
Look at that. See how it fit you?

01:07:35.041 --> 01:07:37.165
Give me three dollars,
and go on and take it.

01:07:37.166 --> 01:07:40.957
- Look at that, Doaker. Don't he look nice?
- [Doaker] Mm-hmm. That's a nice suit.

01:07:40.958 --> 01:07:43.207
Got a shirt to go with it.
Cost you a dollar.

01:07:43.208 --> 01:07:45.207
Four dollars, and you got the whole deal.

01:07:45.208 --> 01:07:46.915
How this look, Boy Willie?

01:07:46.916 --> 01:07:49.290
That look nice.
If you like that kind of thing.

01:07:49.291 --> 01:07:52.333
That's the kind of suit you need
for up here in the North.

01:07:52.833 --> 01:07:56.374
Four dollars for everything?
The suit and the shirt?

01:07:56.375 --> 01:07:57.499
That's cheap.

01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:00.666
- I should be charging you $20.
- [Lymon] Okay.

01:08:09.333 --> 01:08:10.958
- [Lymon] Oh.
- [laughing]

01:08:12.125 --> 01:08:13.958
- Here go the four dollars.
- Mm.

01:08:15.125 --> 01:08:17.500
You got some shoes? What size you wear?

01:08:18.041 --> 01:08:19.000
Size nine.

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:22.832
That's what size I got. Size nine.
I'll let you have 'em for three dollars.

01:08:22.833 --> 01:08:26.082
- Where they at? Let me see 'em.
- Whoo! They some real nice shoes too.

01:08:26.083 --> 01:08:30.207
They got a nice tip to 'em.
Got pointy toe just like you want.

01:08:30.208 --> 01:08:31.416
[laughs]

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:36.708
Come on, Boy Willie. Let's go out tonight.
I wanna see what it look like up here.

01:08:37.833 --> 01:08:39.666
Maybe we go to the picture show.

01:08:40.166 --> 01:08:42.457
Hey, Doaker.
They got picture shows up here?

01:08:42.458 --> 01:08:45.249
Yeah, the Rhumba Theater.
Down there on Fullerton Street.

01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:48.665
Got a speaker on the sidewalk.
Can't miss it. Boy Willie know where.

01:08:48.666 --> 01:08:51.624
Let's go to the picture show, Boy Willie.
Let's find some women.

01:08:51.625 --> 01:08:54.082
Whoo! Size nine.

01:08:54.083 --> 01:08:55.375
Cost you three dollars.

01:08:56.458 --> 01:09:00.124
That's a Florsheim shoe.
That's the kind Stagger Lee wore.

01:09:00.125 --> 01:09:01.250
[Lymon] Mm.

01:09:02.750 --> 01:09:04.415
You sure these size nine?

01:09:04.416 --> 01:09:07.874
You can look at my feet
and see we wear the same size.

01:09:07.875 --> 01:09:10.040
Man, when you put on that suit
and them shoes,

01:09:10.041 --> 01:09:11.707
you'll be the king of the walk.

01:09:11.708 --> 01:09:13.125
I'll give you a break.

01:09:13.666 --> 01:09:16.750
Go on and take 'em for... two dollars.

01:09:23.625 --> 01:09:26.375
Come on, Boy Willie.
Let's go find some women.

01:09:26.916 --> 01:09:31.291
I'm gonna go upstairs and go get ready.
I'll be ready to go in a minute.

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.000
[laughing]

01:09:35.708 --> 01:09:37.832
That's all Lymon think about is women.

01:09:37.833 --> 01:09:41.458
His daddy was the same way.
I used to run around with him.

01:09:42.041 --> 01:09:43.541
And I know his mama too.

01:09:44.041 --> 01:09:46.415
Two strokes back,
and I would've been his daddy.

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:47.707

Oh yeah, you know.

01:11:04.625 --> 01:11:06.624
We going downtown. Hey!

01:11:06.625 --> 01:11:09.457
[Boy Willie] Why, hello, hello, beautiful.
Come on, let's dance.

01:11:09.458 --> 01:11:11.125
- [laughs]

01:11:12.625 --> 01:11:13.750
[laughing] Yeah.

01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:15.750
[Lucille] Hey, now!

01:11:17.375 --> 01:11:18.958
[Berniece] Come on. Let's pray.

01:11:23.083 --> 01:11:25.707
<i>Now I lay me down to sleep</i>

01:11:25.708 --> 01:11:28.540
<i>I pray the Lord my soul to keep</i>

01:11:28.541 --> 01:11:31.290
<i>If I should die before I wake</i>

01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:33.666
<i>I pray the Lord my soul to take</i>

01:11:34.166 --> 01:11:36.207
- God bless Doaker.
- God bless Doaker.

01:11:36.208 --> 01:11:38.415
- God bless Avery.
- God bless Avery.

01:11:38.416 --> 01:11:41.207
- God bless Wining Boy.
- God bless Wining Boy.

01:11:41.208 --> 01:11:43.749
- God bless Boy Willie.
- God bless Boy Willie.

01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:45.833
[ominous clattering]

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:48.291
[Berniece] Come on.

01:11:52.958 --> 01:11:54.166
[click]

01:11:56.041 --> 01:11:57.041
[click]

01:12:17.291 --> 01:12:18.833
[ominous piano music playing]

01:12:23.666 --> 01:12:24.875
[music stops]

01:12:35.875 --> 01:12:36.791
[sighs]

01:12:51.541 --> 01:12:52.625
[Berniece humming]

01:13:10.416 --> 01:13:12.416
[water gently sloshing]

01:13:25.333 --> 01:13:27.750
[humming]

01:13:29.458 --> 01:13:31.458
[humming]

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:34.291
[humming]

01:13:36.208 --> 01:13:38.875
[humming]

01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:43.291
[both humming]

01:13:51.416 --> 01:13:52.958
[knocking at door]

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
[knocking at door]

01:14:01.583 --> 01:14:04.208
- [Berniece] Who is it?
- [Avery] It's... it's me, Avery.

01:14:05.083 --> 01:14:06.541
[Berniece sighs]

01:14:07.416 --> 01:14:08.375
[sniffles]

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:16.291
- [Berniece] Avery.
- [Avery] Hey.

01:14:17.458 --> 01:14:18.458
[Berniece] Come on in.

01:14:19.916 --> 01:14:23.041
I was just... finishing my bath.

01:14:29.416 --> 01:14:30.541
Where Boy Willie?

01:14:31.958 --> 01:14:36.416
That truck almost empty. They done sold
almost all... all them watermelons, huh?

01:14:36.916 --> 01:14:40.125
I don't know where they went off to.
They was gone when I come home.

01:14:42.958 --> 01:14:46.082
Oh, what Mr. Cohen say
about letting you have the place?

01:14:46.083 --> 01:14:49.416
Well, he say he'll let me have it
for $30 a month.

01:14:49.916 --> 01:14:51.916
[laughs] I talked him out of 35.

01:14:52.958 --> 01:14:54.957
It's a nice spot,
next to Benny's diamond store.

01:14:54.958 --> 01:14:56.208
[Avery] Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:03.666
Berniece, uh...

01:15:06.458 --> 01:15:07.375
Just...

01:15:08.166 --> 01:15:09.666
Come on. You know, I...

01:15:10.416 --> 01:15:14.083
I be at home, and I... I get to thinking.

01:15:15.791 --> 01:15:18.624
You up here, and I'm down there,

01:15:18.625 --> 01:15:22.041
and I get to thinking how that look
to have a preacher that ain't married.

01:15:24.375 --> 01:15:26.374
I mean, it'd make
for a better congregation

01:15:26.375 --> 01:15:28.957
if the... if the preacher
was settled down and married.

01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:30.375
- Avery.
- Hmm?

01:15:31.666 --> 01:15:32.541
Not now.

01:15:33.583 --> 01:15:34.458
[Avery scoffs]

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Come on, Berniece.
You... you know how I feel about you.

01:15:38.875 --> 01:15:41.665
- Now, I done got the place from Mr. Cohen.
- Mm.

01:15:41.666 --> 01:15:44.582
I get the money from the bank,
I... I can fix it up real nice.

01:15:44.583 --> 01:15:47.666
They give me a ten-cents-an-hour raise
down there on the job.

01:15:48.208 --> 01:15:52.208
And you know me. I ain't got...
I ain't got much in the way of comforts.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:53.832
[Avery chuckles]

01:15:53.833 --> 01:15:57.166
I got a hole in my pocket near about
as far as money is concerned.

01:15:58.291 --> 01:15:59.458
But I ain't never

01:16:00.791 --> 01:16:01.915
found my way through life

01:16:01.916 --> 01:16:04.957
to a woman I cares about
like I cares about you, Berniece.

01:16:04.958 --> 01:16:06.415
I need that.

01:16:06.416 --> 01:16:07.458
Avery,

01:16:08.541 --> 01:16:10.250
I ain't ready to get married now.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:11.958
[Avery chuckles]

01:16:12.458 --> 01:16:14.457
You too young a woman
to close up, Berniece.

01:16:14.458 --> 01:16:17.749
I ain't said nothing about closing up.
I got a lot of woman left in me.

01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:21.750
[chuckles] Well, where's it at?
When's the last time you looked at it?

01:16:24.541 --> 01:16:26.958
[Berniece] That's a nasty thing to say.

01:16:28.208 --> 01:16:29.874
And you call yourself a preacher.

01:16:29.875 --> 01:16:32.874
Anytime I get anywhere near you,
it's like you push me away.

01:16:32.875 --> 01:16:35.082
I got enough on my hands with Maretha.

01:16:35.083 --> 01:16:37.874
I got enough people
to love and take care of.

01:16:37.875 --> 01:16:39.625
Okay, well, who you got to love you?

01:16:42.291 --> 01:16:44.540
Can't nobody get close enough to ya.

01:16:44.541 --> 01:16:47.624
Doaker can't half say nothing to you.
You jump all over Boy Willie.

01:16:47.625 --> 01:16:49.416
Who you got to love you, Berniece?

01:16:50.958 --> 01:16:53.749
You trying to tell me
a woman can't be nothing without a man?

01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:56.458
- [scoffs] Okay.
- But you all right, hmm?

01:16:57.166 --> 01:17:00.790
You can just walk out of here without me,
without a woman, and still be a man.

01:17:00.791 --> 01:17:01.875
That's all right.

01:17:02.375 --> 01:17:05.915
Ain't nobody gonna ask you,
"Avery, who you got to love you?"

01:17:05.916 --> 01:17:07.333
That's all right for you.

01:17:07.958 --> 01:17:10.624
But everybody gonna be worried
about Berniece.

01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:14.290
"How Berniece gonna take care of herself?
How she raise that child without a man?"

01:17:14.291 --> 01:17:16.832
"Wonder what she do with herself.
How she gonna live like that?"

01:17:16.833 --> 01:17:18.832
Everybody got all kinds of questions
for Berniece.

01:17:18.833 --> 01:17:21.082
Telling me I can't be a woman
unless I got a man.

01:17:21.083 --> 01:17:25.124
Well, you tell me, Avery. You know.
How much woman am I?

01:17:25.125 --> 01:17:29.082
It wasn't me, Berniece.
You can't blame me for nobody else.

01:17:29.083 --> 01:17:31.083
I ain't blaming nobody for nothing.

01:17:33.166 --> 01:17:36.041
I'm just... stating facts.

01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:41.375
How long you gonna carry
Crawley with you, Berniece?

01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:44.750
It's been over, what, three years?

01:17:45.875 --> 01:17:49.374
At some point,
you gonna have to let go and go on.

01:17:49.375 --> 01:17:52.124
Life got twists and turns.
That don't mean you stop living.

01:17:52.125 --> 01:17:54.457
Crawley been dead three years, Berniece.
Three years!

01:17:54.458 --> 01:17:56.874
I know how long Crawley been dead.
You ain't got to tell me.

01:17:56.875 --> 01:17:58.999
I... I just ain't ready
to get married right now.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Well, what is you ready for, Berniece?

01:18:01.833 --> 01:18:04.415
You... you just gonna drift along
from day to day?

01:18:04.416 --> 01:18:07.082
Life's more than about just making it
from one day to another.

01:18:07.083 --> 01:18:10.041
You gonna look up one day,
and it's all gonna be past you.

01:18:10.666 --> 01:18:12.583
I'm standing here right now.

01:18:14.708 --> 01:18:17.333
But I don't know how much longer
I'm gonna be waiting on you.

01:18:18.166 --> 01:18:19.833
Avery, I told you.

01:18:20.458 --> 01:18:22.916
When you get your church,
we can sit down and talk about this.

01:18:23.666 --> 01:18:25.874
I got too many other things
to deal with right now.

01:18:25.875 --> 01:18:27.082
Yeah.

01:18:27.083 --> 01:18:28.750
[Berniece] Boy Willie and the piano

01:18:29.625 --> 01:18:30.916
and Sutter's ghost.

01:18:32.166 --> 01:18:34.416
I thought I might've
just been seeing things, but...

01:18:36.125 --> 01:18:37.832
Maretha done seen Sutter's ghost too.

01:18:37.833 --> 01:18:39.040
When this happen, Berniece?

01:18:39.041 --> 01:18:40.875
Right after I came home yesterday.

01:18:42.625 --> 01:18:44.500
Maretha scared to sleep up there now.

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:53.750
Maybe... if you bless the house,
he'll go away.

01:18:56.083 --> 01:18:58.083
Oh, I... I don't know, Berniece.

01:18:59.583 --> 01:19:02.665
I don't know if I should be fooling around
with something like that now.

01:19:02.666 --> 01:19:05.166
I can't have Maretha
scared to sleep up there.

01:19:06.916 --> 01:19:09.290
Seem like you bless the house,
he would go away.

01:19:09.291 --> 01:19:11.457
You might gotta be
a special kind of preacher

01:19:11.458 --> 01:19:13.083
to do something like that.

01:19:20.625 --> 01:19:22.125
I keep telling myself

01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:26.041
when Boy Willie leave,
he'll go on and leave with him.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.499
I believe Boy Willie
pushed him in the well.

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:35.375
No, that's been going on down there
for a long time.

01:19:36.166 --> 01:19:38.374
Ghosts of the Yellow Dog
been pushing people in they wells

01:19:38.375 --> 01:19:40.165
long before Boy Willie got grown.

01:19:40.166 --> 01:19:42.832
Somebody down there
pushing them people in they wells.

01:19:42.833 --> 01:19:44.458
They ain't just upped and fell.

01:19:47.125 --> 01:19:49.500
What Doaker say
about Boy Willie selling that piano?

01:19:50.083 --> 01:19:53.666
Doaker don't want no part of that piano.
He ain't never wanted no part of it.

01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:58.082
He washed his hands of that piano
a long time ago.

01:19:58.083 --> 01:19:59.790
[piano playing softly]

01:19:59.791 --> 01:20:01.540
He ain't want me to bring it up here,

01:20:01.541 --> 01:20:04.666
but... I wasn't gonna leave it down there.

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:08.624
When my mama died,
I shut the top on that piano,

01:20:08.625 --> 01:20:10.541
and I ain't never opened it since.

01:20:11.833 --> 01:20:13.374
I was only playing it for her.

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:14.499
[Avery sniffles]

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.707
[uneasy music playing]

01:20:16.708 --> 01:20:21.332
When my daddy died, seem like
all her life went into that piano.

01:20:21.333 --> 01:20:23.416
[piano music playing]

01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:28.125
[Berniece] <i>She used to
have me playing on it.</i>

01:20:31.708 --> 01:20:35.582
<i>Say when I played it,
she could hear my daddy talking to her.</i>

01:20:35.583 --> 01:20:40.415
[woman whispering] Berniece,
I cleaned it up for you. Play something.

01:20:40.416 --> 01:20:44.665
[Berniece] <i>I used to think them pictures
come alive and walk through the house.</i>

01:20:44.666 --> 01:20:45.791
[woman whispers] It's time.

01:20:46.875 --> 01:20:48.583
[Berniece] <i>Sometimes, late at night,</i>

01:20:49.666 --> 01:20:51.500
<i>I could hear my mama talking to 'em.</i>

01:20:55.625 --> 01:20:57.541
I said that wasn't gonna happen to me.

01:20:58.666 --> 01:21:01.916
I don't play on that piano
'cause I don't wanna wake them spirits.

01:21:03.208 --> 01:21:06.250
They never... never be walking around
in this house.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.083
[Avery] You got to put all of that
behind you, Berniece.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.916
It's the same thing like Crawley.

01:21:14.666 --> 01:21:17.125
Everybody got stones in their passway.

01:21:19.583 --> 01:21:21.375
You could walk in there right now...

01:21:23.083 --> 01:21:24.416
right now and play that piano.

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:28.457
You could walk over there right now,

01:21:28.458 --> 01:21:31.583
and God is gonna walk over there
with you, Berniece.

01:21:32.250 --> 01:21:35.291
You could set that sack of stones down
by the side of the road

01:21:35.958 --> 01:21:37.290
and walk away from it.

01:21:37.291 --> 01:21:38.499
Come on, Berniece.

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:41.915
Come on. Set it down
and walk away from it, Berniece.

01:21:41.916 --> 01:21:46.957
Come on. Walk... walk over here and claim it
as an instrument of the Lord, Berniece.

01:21:46.958 --> 01:21:50.250
You can walk over here right now
and make it into a celebration.

01:21:51.833 --> 01:21:54.125
Avery, I done told you
I don't play on that piano.

01:21:55.125 --> 01:21:56.082
Now or no other time.

01:21:56.083 --> 01:21:59.291
The Bible say,
"The Lord is my refuge and my strength."

01:22:00.458 --> 01:22:03.040
With the strength of God,
you can put the past behind you, Berniece.

01:22:03.041 --> 01:22:05.625
With the strength of God,
you can do anything.

01:22:06.958 --> 01:22:10.207
God don't ask you what you done.
God ask you what you gonna do.

01:22:10.208 --> 01:22:13.916
And all you got to do
is walk over here right now and claim it.

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:21.541
Come on, Berniece.

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:25.333
Come on.

01:22:27.041 --> 01:22:28.041
That's it.

01:22:37.958 --> 01:22:38.916
Avery,

01:22:39.875 --> 01:22:40.708
just...

01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:44.083
go on

01:22:45.875 --> 01:22:47.500
and let me finish my bath.

01:22:51.291 --> 01:22:52.458
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:22:57.083 --> 01:22:58.250
[Avery exhales sharply]

01:22:59.875 --> 01:23:01.041
Okay, Berniece.

01:23:04.333 --> 01:23:05.791
Okay, I'm gonna go home.

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:12.000
I... I'm gonna go home...
and I'm gonna read up on my Bible.

tell her about that piano.

you can teach it what you want.

01:36:02.333 --> 01:36:04.333
Why I wanna bring a child into this world?

01:36:04.833 --> 01:36:07.916
Why I wanna bring somebody else
into all this for?

01:36:08.666 --> 01:36:09.916
I tell you this.

01:36:11.583 --> 01:36:15.625
[scoffs] If I was Rockefeller,
I'd have 40 or 50.

01:36:16.125 --> 01:36:17.290
I'd make one every day

01:36:17.291 --> 01:36:20.333
'cause they gonna start out in life
with all the advantages.

01:36:20.833 --> 01:36:22.790
I ain't got no advantages to offer nobody.

01:36:22.791 --> 01:36:26.457
Many is the time I looked at my daddy,
seen him staring off at his hands.

01:36:26.458 --> 01:36:28.415
I got older, I know what he was thinking.

01:36:28.416 --> 01:36:29.790
He was sitting there saying,

01:36:29.791 --> 01:36:33.291
"I got these big old hands,
but what I'm gonna do with 'em?"

01:36:34.208 --> 01:36:36.874
"Got these big old hands
capable of doing anything."

01:36:36.875 --> 01:36:39.249
"I could take and build something
with these hands,

01:36:39.250 --> 01:36:41.332
but where's the tools?"

01:36:41.333 --> 01:36:43.083
"All I got is these hands."

01:36:44.041 --> 01:36:47.249
Now, if he had his own land, Berniece,
he wouldn't have felt that way.

01:36:47.250 --> 01:36:48.832
If he had something...

01:36:48.833 --> 01:36:51.665
If he had something under his feet
that belonged to him,

01:36:51.666 --> 01:36:52.915
he could stand up taller.

01:36:52.916 --> 01:36:54.500
That's what I'm talking about.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.415
Ain't no mystery to life.
You go out and meet it square on.

01:36:57.416 --> 01:36:59.832
If you teach that girl
that she living at the bottom of life,

01:36:59.833 --> 01:37:00.874
she gonna hate you.

01:37:00.875 --> 01:37:04.458
I'm gonna teach her the truth.
It's just where she living.

01:37:05.083 --> 01:37:08.290
Only she ain't got to stay there.
Turn your head over to the other side.

01:37:08.291 --> 01:37:10.582
That might be your bottom,
but it ain't mine.

01:37:10.583 --> 01:37:12.082
I'm living at the top of life.

01:37:12.083 --> 01:37:14.582
I ain't gonna take my life
and throw it away at the bottom.

01:37:14.583 --> 01:37:16.124
I'm in the world like everybody else.

01:37:16.125 --> 01:37:19.582
The way I see it, everybody else
gotta come up a little to be where I am.

01:37:19.583 --> 01:37:21.540
You right at the bottom
with the rest of us.

01:37:21.541 --> 01:37:23.665
[Boy Willie] If you believe that,
you'll act that way.

01:37:23.666 --> 01:37:25.499
If you act that way,
that's where you'll be.

01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:28.749
Doaker, Berniece say all colored folks
living at the bottom of life.

01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:31.040
I tell her she think that,
that's where she gonna be.

01:37:31.041 --> 01:37:33.832
You living at the bottom of life?
Is that how you see yourself?

01:37:33.833 --> 01:37:37.790
I'm just living the best way I know how.
Ain't thinking about no top or no bottom.

01:37:37.791 --> 01:37:39.790
[Boy Willie] That's what
I tried to tell Berniece.

01:37:39.791 --> 01:37:43.832
I don't know where she got that from.
Sound like something Avery would say.

01:37:43.833 --> 01:37:46.707
Avery think 'cause the white man
give him a turkey for Thanksgiving,

01:37:46.708 --> 01:37:48.582
that make him better than everybody else.

01:37:48.583 --> 01:37:50.499
That gonna raise him up
out the bottom of life.

01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:53.915
I don't need nobody to give me a turkey.
I can get my own turkey.

01:37:53.916 --> 01:37:57.707
All you got to do is get out of my way.
I'll get me two or three turkeys.

01:37:57.708 --> 01:38:00.582
You can't even get a chicken,
let alone two or three turkeys.

01:38:00.583 --> 01:38:03.165
Talking about get out your way.
Ain't nobody in your way.

01:38:03.166 --> 01:38:04.874
Straighten your head up, Maretha.

01:38:04.875 --> 01:38:07.333
Don't be bending down like that.
You hold your head up.

01:38:09.125 --> 01:38:11.916
All you ever had going for you is talk.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.500
Your whole life,
that's all you ever had going for you.

01:38:24.333 --> 01:38:27.458
I'm gonna tell you something about me.

01:38:29.208 --> 01:38:31.000
I was born to a time of fire.

01:38:31.916 --> 01:38:34.791
The world ain't wanted no part of me,
and I could see that

01:38:35.625 --> 01:38:38.375
ever since I was about... seven.

01:38:39.583 --> 01:38:41.916
The world say it's better off without me.

01:38:42.875 --> 01:38:44.791
See, Berniece accept that.

01:38:45.375 --> 01:38:47.624
She trying to prove something
to the world.

01:38:47.625 --> 01:38:51.332
The world a better place 'cause of me.
I don't see it like Berniece.

01:38:51.333 --> 01:38:54.707
I got a heart that beats.
It beats just as loud as the next fella's.

01:38:54.708 --> 01:38:57.291
Don't care if he Black or white.

01:38:59.750 --> 01:39:01.250
Sometimes it beats louder.

01:39:02.333 --> 01:39:05.040
And when it beats louder,
then everybody can hear it.

01:39:05.041 --> 01:39:07.582
Some people get scared of that.
Like Berniece.

01:39:07.583 --> 01:39:10.416
Some people get scared
to hear a nigger's heart beating.

01:39:13.250 --> 01:39:15.208
But my mama ain't birth me for nothing.

01:39:16.958 --> 01:39:18.208
So what I got to do?

01:39:20.791 --> 01:39:25.000
Gotta make my mark along the road,
like when... when you write on a tree.

01:39:27.583 --> 01:39:28.833
"Boy Willie was here."

01:39:32.541 --> 01:39:34.583
That's all I'm trying to do
with that piano.

01:39:36.125 --> 01:39:40.541
Trying to make my mark along the road
like... like my daddy done.

01:39:44.375 --> 01:39:47.082
Other than that, I ain't thinking
about nothing Berniece got to say.

01:39:47.083 --> 01:39:48.333
[knocking at door]

01:39:52.791 --> 01:39:54.500
[Boy Willie] Where you been, nigger?

01:39:55.375 --> 01:39:56.541
Oh, I thought you was Lymon.

01:39:58.750 --> 01:40:02.415
- Hey, Berniece, look who's here.
- [Doaker] Come on in, Avery. Have a seat.

01:40:02.416 --> 01:40:05.041
Don't pay neither of them no mind.
They been fussing all day.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.083
[Berniece] Here, set that comb back
over on that stove.

01:40:08.708 --> 01:40:11.624
[Doaker] Berniece said you was coming by
to bless the house.

01:40:11.625 --> 01:40:13.625
[Avery] Yeah, I done read up on my Bible.

01:40:14.125 --> 01:40:16.624
She asked me to see about
getting rid of Sutter's ghost.

01:40:16.625 --> 01:40:19.790
Ain't no ghost in this house.
That's all in Berniece's head.

01:40:19.791 --> 01:40:21.082
[Doaker] Let her find that out.

01:40:21.083 --> 01:40:24.332
If blessing the house gonna make her
feel better, what it got to do with you?

01:40:24.333 --> 01:40:26.125
Berniece say Maretha seen him too.

01:40:27.250 --> 01:40:30.249
I don't know, but I found
a part in the Bible to bless this house.

01:40:30.250 --> 01:40:32.207
If he here,
then that ought to make him go away.

01:40:32.208 --> 01:40:34.332
You worse than Berniece
believing that stuff.

01:40:34.333 --> 01:40:37.124
Talking about if he here.
Go on up there and find out.

01:40:37.125 --> 01:40:39.083
I've been up there, and I ain't seen him.

01:40:39.791 --> 01:40:43.707
If you say that Bible will make the man
leave her imagination, you might be right.

01:40:43.708 --> 01:40:45.832
- But if--
- Boy Willie, why don't you be quiet?

01:40:45.833 --> 01:40:48.374
Getting in the man's business.
This got nothing to do with you.

01:40:48.375 --> 01:40:49.707
Let him do what he gonna do.

01:40:49.708 --> 01:40:52.458
I ain't stopping him.
Avery ain't got power to do nothing.

01:40:53.125 --> 01:40:55.666
[Avery] I ain't got no power, Boy Willie.
God got the power.

01:40:56.333 --> 01:40:58.207
God got power
over everything in his creation.

01:40:58.208 --> 01:41:01.791
God can do anything. God say,
"As I commandeth, so shall it be."

01:41:02.375 --> 01:41:05.125
God said, "Let there be light,"
and there was light.

01:41:05.625 --> 01:41:08.165
He made the world in six days,
and he rested on the seventh.

01:41:08.166 --> 01:41:11.082
God's got a wonderful power.
God got power over life and death.

01:41:11.083 --> 01:41:13.457
I ain't afraid of him chasing away
no little old ghost.

01:41:13.458 --> 01:41:15.166
[knocking at door]

01:41:17.375 --> 01:41:18.541
[knocking at door]

01:41:19.125 --> 01:41:21.832
Where you been? I been waiting on you.
You run off somewhere.

01:41:21.833 --> 01:41:24.124
I ran into Grace.

01:41:24.125 --> 01:41:26.208
[Boy Willie] I ain't thinking about
no Grace nothing.

01:41:30.833 --> 01:41:32.083
Hi, Berniece.

01:41:33.791 --> 01:41:36.124
Lymon, give me that rope,
get on the other side of the piano.

01:41:36.125 --> 01:41:38.915
Now, Boy Willie, don't start nothing now.

01:41:38.916 --> 01:41:40.790
Leave that piano alone.

01:41:40.791 --> 01:41:44.000
[Boy Willie] Watch that board, Lymon.
Stay out of this, Doaker.

01:41:44.541 --> 01:41:47.790
[Doaker] You can't just take the piano.
How you gonna just take the piano?

01:41:47.791 --> 01:41:50.457
Berniece ain't said nothing
about selling that piano.

01:41:50.458 --> 01:41:53.749
She ain't got to. Come on, Lymon.
We got to lift one end at a time.

01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:56.915
- What we gonna do with the rope?
- [Boy Willie] Just get on the other side.

01:41:56.916 --> 01:41:58.333
Boy Willie-- Berniece.

01:41:58.958 --> 01:42:01.499
[Lymon] Boy Willie,
you sure you wanna do this?

01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:04.957
Oh, Berniece, Boy Willie,
y'all ought to sit down and talk this out.

01:42:04.958 --> 01:42:06.250
Ain't nothing to talk out.

01:42:08.666 --> 01:42:10.250
I'm through talking to Berniece.

01:42:10.833 --> 01:42:12.040
Come on, Lymon.

01:42:12.041 --> 01:42:13.874
Maretha, get on out the way.

01:42:13.875 --> 01:42:15.415
Get her out the way, Doaker!

01:42:15.416 --> 01:42:18.041
[Doaker] Come on. Come on.
Go and do like your mama said.

01:42:18.541 --> 01:42:20.582
[door opens, closes]

01:42:20.583 --> 01:42:23.541
Man, these niggers round here!

01:42:24.416 --> 01:42:26.749
I stopped down there at Seefus.

01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:30.165
These folks jumping back
and getting off the sidewalk

01:42:30.166 --> 01:42:32.791
talking about a Patchneck Red's coming.

01:42:33.708 --> 01:42:35.083
Come to find out,

01:42:35.958 --> 01:42:38.208
you know who they was talking about?

01:42:40.083 --> 01:42:43.083
Old John D. from up around Tyler.

01:42:43.875 --> 01:42:47.916
He got everybody scared of him.
Calling him Patchneck Red.

01:42:48.666 --> 01:42:52.874
They don't know
I whupped the nigger's head in one time.

01:42:52.875 --> 01:42:54.957
[Boy Willie] Make sure
that board don't slide, Lymon.

01:42:54.958 --> 01:42:56.624
Hey, Boy Willie, what you got?

01:42:56.625 --> 01:42:58.749
I know you got a pint
stuck up in your coat.

01:42:58.750 --> 01:43:00.374
Get out the way, Wining Boy.

01:43:00.375 --> 01:43:02.707
Hey, Doaker, what you got?
Give me a drink. I want a drink.

01:43:02.708 --> 01:43:05.332
It look like you done had enough
of whatever it was.

01:43:05.333 --> 01:43:08.082
Talking about "What you got?"
Find somewhere to lay down.

01:43:08.083 --> 01:43:10.332
I ain't worried
about no place to lie down.

01:43:10.333 --> 01:43:13.707
I can always find me a place to lay down
in Berniece's house.

01:43:13.708 --> 01:43:16.332
Ain't that right, Berniece? [laughs]

01:43:16.333 --> 01:43:19.040
Wining Boy, go sit down somewhere.

01:43:19.041 --> 01:43:21.790
You been drinking all day.
Come in here smelling like an old polecat.

01:43:21.791 --> 01:43:23.957
You know Berniece don't like
all that drinking.

01:43:23.958 --> 01:43:26.416
I ain't disrespecting Berniece.

01:43:26.958 --> 01:43:29.333
Berniece, am I disrespecting you?

01:43:29.833 --> 01:43:31.833
I'm just trying to be nice.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.666
I been with strangers all day,
and they treated me like family.

01:43:37.416 --> 01:43:40.708
I come in here to family,
you treat me like a stranger.

01:43:41.583 --> 01:43:43.707
I don't need your whiskey.

01:43:43.708 --> 01:43:45.208
I can buy my own.

01:43:45.708 --> 01:43:48.207
I wanted your company, not your whiskey.

01:43:48.208 --> 01:43:51.040
[Doaker] Go upstairs and lay down.
You don't need nothing else to drink.

01:43:51.041 --> 01:43:53.166
I ain't thinking about no laying down!

01:43:53.666 --> 01:43:56.832
Me and Boy Willie fixing to party.
Ain't that right, Boy Willie?

01:43:56.833 --> 01:43:57.915
Tell 'em.

01:43:57.916 --> 01:44:00.290
I'm fixing to play me some piano.
Watch this.

01:44:00.291 --> 01:44:02.457
Come on. Me and Lymon
fixing to move the piano.

01:44:02.458 --> 01:44:05.707
- No, no. You ain't moving this piano.
- Get out the way, Wining Boy.

01:44:05.708 --> 01:44:09.707
[Wining Boy] You ain't taking this piano
out the house. You got to take me with it!

01:44:09.708 --> 01:44:11.790
Get out the way, Wining Boy.
Doaker, get him.

01:44:11.791 --> 01:44:14.000
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:44:15.666 --> 01:44:17.916
This a song I wrote for Cleotha.

01:44:19.875 --> 01:44:21.791
I wrote this song in her memory.

01:44:26.291 --> 01:44:29.166

01:45:20.583 --> 01:45:23.083
Hey, Doaker, did you feel that?

01:45:25.791 --> 01:45:28.541
Hey, Berniece, did you get cold?

01:45:30.250 --> 01:45:32.124
- Hey, Doaker--
- What you calling me for?

May this vial of water
be empowered with thy spirit, Father God.

01:46:53.666 --> 01:46:58.290
May it be a weapon and a shield
against the presence of all evil, Father.

01:46:58.291 --> 01:47:02.458
May it be a cleansing and a blessing
upon this humble abode.

01:47:03.166 --> 01:47:04.749
Where there is good,

01:47:04.750 --> 01:47:07.582
so shall evil be scattered
to the four winds.

01:47:07.583 --> 01:47:09.291
Get thee behind me, Satan.

01:47:10.125 --> 01:47:15.332
