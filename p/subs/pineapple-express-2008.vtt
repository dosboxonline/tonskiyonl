When you think of yo?r s?periors,

02:53.590 --> 02:55.174
Yo? know what problem I have...

02:55.341 --> 02:58.677

03:03.975 --> 03:07.436
Two: Why are We

03:07.604 --> 03:10.772
Why can't we be out in the open?
Why aren't we in a square right now?

03:10.940 --> 03:14.276
Why aren't we talking to people'
letting them know ltem 9 exists?

03:14.444 --> 03:16.987
Get it out. Shout off the rooftops:

03:17.155 --> 03:21.658
"This is great!

I'm serio?s. Your dick' my mouth.

03:31.502 --> 03:33.253
That's inappropriate.

03:41.512 --> 03:42.554
Fuck yo?!

03:42.722 --> 03:46.391
I've seen enough. Shut it down.

03:46.559 --> 03:50.145
Bury the hatch. Sell the land.
And dispose of him.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.647
This never happened.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.440
D?de, what happened to yo?r eye?

03:54.067 --> 03:55.651

04:06.412 --> 04:07.871
Hey, this is Sam. Good morning.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.206
Welcome to KRAD.

04:09.374 --> 04:12.334
You know, I think that last caller

04:12.502 --> 04:15.170
Right now, we're gonna get
to the next caller, Dale Denton.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.255

First-time caller.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.759
- ?ere's my piece.
- All right.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.679
If marij?ana is not legal
within the next five years...

04:23.846 --> 04:26.932
...I have no faith
left in humanity, period.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.934
Everyone likes smoking weed.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.521
They have for tho?sands of years.
They're not gonna stop anytime soon.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.856
It makes everything better. Makes
food better. Makes music better.

04:35.024 --> 04:37.359
It makes sex feel better,
for God's sakes.

04:37.527 --> 04:40.362
It makes shitty movies better,
you know?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.665
?i, there. Are you Sandra Danby?

04:51.833 --> 04:52.874

Well' I'm Garth

04:57.839 --> 04:59.089

04:59.257 --> 05:01.466
Yo? failed to show up
for divorce proceedings...

05:02.760 --> 05:05.429
...four times under co?rt order,
and yo?'ve been served.

05:05.596 --> 05:08.098
- Oh' great. Thanks a lot' asshole.
- Sorry.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.851
I'm just saying love has no age.

05:11.019 --> 05:14.229
Yo? can't instantly tell me that a man,
because he's a certain age...

05:14.397 --> 05:16.356
...can't marry a woman
or love a woman.

05:16.524 --> 05:17.899
I'm dating a high-school girl.

05:18.067 --> 05:21.820
You're not maximizing your potential.
Think this girl takes you seriously?

05:21.988 --> 05:25.365
?o, b?t if I'm 25
and the girl is 18 years old...

05:25.533 --> 05:27.576
...yo? know, in society,
that might look bad.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.871
- Hey, as long as it's consensual.
- I think it's consensual.

05:32.206 --> 05:33.999

Yo?'ve been served.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.930
Walter Wadska the third.

05:49.098 --> 05:51.433

Yo?'ve been served by the best.
Keep it real.

06:03.404 --> 06:06.448
Why don't yo? get a real job,
yo? fucking cocksucker?

06:11.704 --> 06:15.832

06:34.435 --> 06:36.937
Yo? have repeatedly refused
to trim the monkey tree...

06:37.105 --> 06:39.147
...that spills
onto your neighbor's property.

06:39.315 --> 06:41.900
And noW because of that'
yo?'ve been served.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.151
Yo?'re a jerk.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.320
All this current system is doing...

06:45.488 --> 06:47.739
...is putting money
in the hands of criminals...

06:47.907 --> 06:51.618
...and it's making ordinary people like
yo? and me deal with those criminals.

06:51.786 --> 06:55.247
Yo? ever dealt with a dr?g dealer?
It's terrible' it's weird, it's awkward.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.416
They think they're your friend'
b?t they're not.

06:57.583 --> 07:01.545
Dale, I get your point. Thanks
for your input. Next caller, please.

07:14.183 --> 07:15.976

When Were you gonna tell me?

07:28.448 --> 07:29.990

07:30.158 --> 07:32.033
- Why?
- She's already planning on cousco?s.

07:32.201 --> 07:35.203
I said I might be able to go,
so why is she doing that already?

07:35.371 --> 07:37.372

07:37.540 --> 07:40.250

of the dopest dope I've ever smoked.

12:11.130 --> 12:13.006
?ands doWn'
dopest dope I've ever smoked.

12:13.174 --> 12:16.259
?ot better than the Blue Oyster.
It can't be. I can't handle that.

12:16.427 --> 12:21.097
This is like if that Blue Oyster shit
met that Afghan Kush I had...

12:21.265 --> 12:22.724
...and they had a baby.

12:22.892 --> 12:25.727
And meanwhile, that crazy
?orthern Lights st?ff I had...

12:25.895 --> 12:29.564
...and the S?per Red Especial
Snowflake met and had a baby.

12:29.732 --> 12:33.193
And by some miracle,
those two babies met and fucked...

12:33.361 --> 12:36.571
...this would be the shit
that they birthed.

12:36.739 --> 12:39.074
- Yes.
- This is the product of baby f?cking.

12:39.242 --> 12:40.534
- Smell it.
- Okay.

12:40.701 --> 12:43.036
Smell it. Enjoy.

12:43.204 --> 12:46.373
It's like God's vagina.

12:47.959 --> 12:49.376
What, yo? wanna bathe in it?

12:49.544 --> 12:51.419
- I wanna live in here.
- You Wanna be it?

12:51.587 --> 12:54.714
My God' I j?st wanna shove it
up my nose' have that smell all day.

12:54.882 --> 12:56.967
- That's amazing.
- Shove it anywhere you like.

12:57.134 --> 12:58.426
Beautiful. What's it called?

12:58.594 --> 13:00.720
- Pineapple Express.
- Pineapple Express.

13:00.888 --> 13:02.889
It's this thing, like' El ?ino.

13:03.057 --> 13:06.059
This airflow that comes
from ?awaii and Canada.

13:06.227 --> 13:09.104
It gets the dirt, mixes it in
with the weed in a special way.

13:09.272 --> 13:11.606
It's very scientific.
I won't go into it right now.

13:11.774 --> 13:14.442
But I am the only g?y
in the whole city that has it.

13:14.610 --> 13:16.194
Only 10 bones more for a quarter.

13:16.362 --> 13:18.071
Okay, I'll take a q?arter.

13:18.239 --> 13:20.240
- All right, yo?'re on.
- Thank yo? very m?ch.

13:20.408 --> 13:21.741
Let me get my scale.

13:21.909 --> 13:25.287
Get it going. Grab the scale.
Let's get me out of here.

13:26.414 --> 13:29.249
I thought hurricane season
was over.

13:30.167 --> 13:32.502
Oh' crow.

13:34.755 --> 13:37.632
Where are yo?' you little fucker?

13:39.051 --> 13:42.262

13:43.514 --> 13:44.931

- Yeah.

13:45.099 --> 13:47.434

- You can smoke this?

13:47.602 --> 13:48.685
- Yeah, man.
- ?o.

13:48.853 --> 13:50.937
This is the f?ture.

13:51.105 --> 13:55.942
This is, like' the apex
of the vortex of joint engineering.

13:56.110 --> 13:59.362
It's r?mored that M. M. O'Shaughnessy
designed the first one.

13:59.530 --> 14:02.115
The g?y who designed
the Golden Gate Bridge.

14:02.283 --> 14:04.534
My second favorite civil engineer...

14:04.702 --> 14:08.580
...behind ?annskarl Bandel,
Madison Square Garden.

14:08.748 --> 14:12.542
What yo? do is yo? light all three ends
at the same time.

14:12.710 --> 14:15.962
- Really?
- And then the smoke converges...

14:16.130 --> 14:20.216
...creating a trifecta
of joint-smoking power.

14:20.384 --> 14:23.637
This is it, man. This is what your
grandchildren are gonna be smoking.

14:23.804 --> 14:25.805
Future. The f?ture.

14:25.973 --> 14:28.516
That's amazing.
Well' got the weed?

14:28.684 --> 14:31.603

I really... I can't' man. I gotta...

14:45.993 --> 14:48.119
I can't even light this thing

14:48.829 --> 14:51.206
Yeah, I need yo?r help' man.

14:51.832 --> 14:53.667

15:44.010 --> 15:45.719
It's better to co?gh.

15:45.886 --> 15:47.429
It's like...

15:47.596 --> 15:49.222
Makes yo? 10 times more higher...

15:49.390 --> 15:51.641
...than the cross Weed
and the Pineapple Express.

15:51.809 --> 15:55.603
Yo?'re like'

16:08.576 --> 16:09.951

So I have to wear a suit.

16:53.370 --> 16:57.749

17:10.512 --> 17:12.638
Like subpoenas to people
who don't want them.

17:12.807 --> 17:16.643
I gotta wear disguises sometimes just to
make them admit they're themselves...

17:16.810 --> 17:19.061
...so I can serve them the papers.

17:19.230 --> 17:20.271

19:51.465 --> 19:53.716

25:16.167 --> 25:18.626

of the rarest weed knoWn to mankind.

25:40.983 --> 25:42.525
Is it really that rare?

25:42.985 --> 25:45.028
It's' like, the rarest.

25:46.030 --> 25:47.697
It's almost a shame to smoke it.

25:48.449 --> 25:51.826
It's like killing a unicorn...

25:51.994 --> 25:53.703

28:15.134 --> 28:18.678
Shit. I wish We could
j?st go nowhere.

28:20.806 --> 28:21.973
Okay.

28:22.141 --> 28:27.854
Even if he found that roach,
how could he knoW where you are?

28:29.315 --> 28:31.149
?eat-seeking missiles.

28:32.860 --> 28:33.985
Bloodho?nds.

28:35.029 --> 28:36.571
Foxes.

28:36.739 --> 28:38.364

29:02.765 --> 29:04.849
And we're, like'

One time, he got this girl...

...to give me a hand job, like'

29:10.856 --> 29:15.401
It was like' "I don't

29:15.778 --> 29:20.740
That is pretty rad, b?t, like'
let's say Ted calls him and is like:

29:20.908 --> 29:23.076
"Did yo? sell the Pineapple Express

The same r?les don't apply to Red.

29:41.136 --> 29:44.931
I'm a drug dealer.
Are yo? saying yo? don't tr?st me?

29:45.724 --> 29:48.226
?o, that's not at all What I'm...
Yo? know what?

29:48.394 --> 29:52.355

30:12.126 --> 30:14.794
Don't tell anybody

30:44.742 --> 30:46.367

- You said they Were cops, right?
- They are, yeah.

33:07.136 --> 33:08.678
I was thinking' maybe they can...

33:08.846 --> 33:11.597
...triangulate these things' man'
or, like' trace them.

33:11.765 --> 33:13.683

33:13.851 --> 33:15.685

33:15.853 --> 33:17.520
Maybe they can even trace them...

33:17.688 --> 33:20.148
...like' when We're not even
on them' you know?

33:20.316 --> 33:23.818
Maybe if we bury them, the reception
will cut off and they won't be able to.

33:23.986 --> 33:25.945
We can tie it to an animal,
be a diversion.

33:26.113 --> 33:27.572
We'll never catch an animal.

33:27.740 --> 33:30.199
The sq?irrel'd be ?p in a tree'
they'd think we were.

33:30.367 --> 33:31.993

33:40.919 --> 33:43.129

33:44.798 --> 33:47.967
- What the fuck was that?

Toilet.

45:41.057 --> 45:42.557

Mr. Wiggles?

47:21.490 --> 47:24.242
- Come on. Get back here.
- Saul, help me! ?elp me!

47:24.410 --> 47:25.827
?e's p?nching my bum!

47:25.995 --> 47:28.747
I'm done with this.
Let's talk. Let's try words.

47:28.914 --> 47:32.584
Use words! ?o! ?o! ?o!

47:35.796 --> 47:37.172
Yo? okay, man?

47:37.339 --> 47:39.841

47:41.177 --> 47:42.886
?appy birthday.

47:43.387 --> 47:44.429
- All right?
- Thank yo?.

47:44.597 --> 47:46.890
I think there's a package
in the mailbox.

47:47.057 --> 47:49.142
This ends now!

47:53.189 --> 47:54.647
Oh' shit.

47:54.815 --> 47:56.608
Was that too m?ch?

47:58.486 --> 48:00.445
Can't get the edge.

48:00.988 --> 48:02.864
Wait. Got it. Got it.

48:03.032 --> 48:04.199
?ey, Dale.

48:04.366 --> 48:07.702
Think we're gonna have to kill him?
I don't think I'm capable of m?rder.

48:07.870 --> 48:09.078
I don't think I am either.

48:09.246 --> 48:12.040
Maybe we could just convince him
to kill himself.

48:12.208 --> 48:14.626
Or, just not say anything.

48:15.753 --> 48:19.005
We need to find out
everything he knows, okay?

48:19.840 --> 48:21.424
Wake up.

48:21.967 --> 48:23.092

48:26.514 --> 48:27.555

48:27.723 --> 48:30.058
I'm gonna flex and bust out of here.

48:34.271 --> 48:35.480
Trapped.

48:35.648 --> 48:36.898
?ot happening, Red.

48:37.066 --> 48:39.567
Okay. All right. Okay, I'll talk.

48:39.735 --> 48:44.239
Ted Jones, he knoWs you witnessed
the murder. ?e fo?nd your roach.

48:44.406 --> 48:47.408

Budlofsky and Matheson.

48:47.576 --> 48:49.911
Two real big son of a bitches.

48:50.079 --> 48:51.830
They're basically
o?t to kill yo? guys.

48:51.997 --> 48:54.624
They're gonna kill me too,
unless I turn y'all over.

48:54.792 --> 48:56.626
So yo? g?ys are basically f?cked.

48:56.794 --> 48:59.420
?ow many cops does he have

48:59.588 --> 49:02.382

49:02.550 --> 49:05.802
I don't knoW. ?e co?ld have a bunch.
This d?de is super well-connected.

49:05.970 --> 49:08.930
And he has a really awesome
hideout too. It's pretty badass.

49:09.098 --> 49:10.682
- Oh' shit.
- What else?

49:10.850 --> 49:13.059
?e's at a war right now
with the Asians.

49:13.227 --> 49:14.686
They're in a drug war right now.

49:14.854 --> 49:17.188
Asians? What Asians?
Indians are technically Asian.

49:17.356 --> 49:18.940
- It's true.
- What Asians?

49:19.108 --> 49:22.944
I don't knoW. What? Chinese?
Or Korean or...

49:23.112 --> 49:24.112
Vietcong?

49:24.280 --> 49:26.948
Yeah, little... Just little Asian people.

49:27.116 --> 49:32.745
Like, the Asians with the guns
and the dr?gs, and not his friends.

49:32.913 --> 49:33.955
- Ding-dong.
- ?ey' Red!

49:34.123 --> 49:35.456
- Oh' shit.

49:35.624 --> 49:36.958
They're here to kill me.

49:37.126 --> 49:41.004
Okay, I know I sold y'all out. I've been
a son of a bitch and a shitty friend.

49:41.171 --> 49:43.590
Sa?l, I'm talking to you.
Dale, yo?'re a neW friend.

49:43.757 --> 49:45.967
I can make it up.
I forgot' "bro's before ho's."

49:46.135 --> 49:48.595
Just go o?t the back porch.
I won't say anything.

49:48.762 --> 49:50.138
- I'll cover for yo?.
- Thanks.

49:50.306 --> 49:52.056
?o sweat.

49:56.520 --> 49:58.438
It was Dale Denton.
Dale Denton and Saul.

49:58.606 --> 50:01.774
They're on the back porch.
Yo? can catch them if you hurry. Go.

50:04.445 --> 50:06.029
?ey. In here.

50:06.196 --> 50:08.197
I've gotta get to a phone. Come on.

50:08.365 --> 50:09.991
- We should hide.
- Why?

50:10.159 --> 50:12.076
If Red tells Ted's guys
abo?t my name...

50:12.244 --> 50:13.995
...then they'll go to my apartment.

50:14.163 --> 50:17.874
There, I have Angie's name. They'll

50:18.042 --> 50:19.542
?o. I think we sho?ld stay.

50:19.710 --> 50:22.045
- Why?

50:22.212 --> 50:25.298
Well' then, get out.
Come on, yo?'re already dirty.

50:27.259 --> 50:29.761
- They're gone.
- Well, find out what he knows.

50:29.929 --> 50:31.429
Red' it's yo?r last chance, man.

50:31.597 --> 50:33.389
Yo? gonna give us something

50:33.557 --> 50:36.976
Matheson, you gotta be kidding me.
I mean, What more do yo? want?

50:37.144 --> 50:39.228
I told you that the guy's name
is Dale Denton.

50:39.396 --> 50:41.022
?e's obviously working with Saul.

50:41.190 --> 50:43.191
They came in here'

50:43.359 --> 50:45.026
They kicked the hell out of me...

50:45.194 --> 50:47.362
...duct-taped me
to my grandfather's wheelchair.

50:47.529 --> 50:50.031
What more do you want?
Want me to read yo?r horoscope?

50:50.199 --> 50:53.868
- You hear that' Ted?
- Ask if either of them were Asian.

50:54.036 --> 50:56.537
- What skin color were they?
- They were white people.

50:56.705 --> 50:58.790
Denton might've been a JeW.
I don't knoW.

50:58.958 --> 51:01.125
I don't j?dge people
based on things like that.

51:01.293 --> 51:03.670
Obvio?sly. We're friends.

51:03.837 --> 51:05.129
Ted, you hear him?

51:05.297 --> 51:09.217
Dale Denton: Not Asian.
All right. Kill Red.

51:09.385 --> 51:12.887
Listen' I would appreciate it
if both y'all would take your shoes off.

51:13.055 --> 51:15.556
This is brand-new carpet.
Yo?'re tracking m?d in here.

51:15.724 --> 51:17.392
Matheson, you got
British Knights on.

51:17.559 --> 51:19.560
I ain't seen anybody wear them
since 1987.

51:21.230 --> 51:23.022
What the hell are you doing?

51:23.190 --> 51:24.899
Ted told me to kill him.

51:25.067 --> 51:27.902
Well' how abo?t
a little fucking discretion here?

51:28.070 --> 51:29.946
See? See? See, right there.
Yo? see that?

51:30.114 --> 51:31.239
- You catch it?
- See What?

51:31.407 --> 51:34.492
Yo? used to not give
a fuck about discretion.

51:34.660 --> 51:37.704
I seen yo? p?ll somebody's
jawbone off. I seen it.

51:38.539 --> 51:39.956
Yo? was r?thless.

51:40.124 --> 51:42.500
Yo? was r?thless, man.

51:42.668 --> 51:45.753
What the f?ck' man?
Yo? shot me in my stomach.

51:46.422 --> 51:48.131
I'm gonna die now probably.

51:48.298 --> 51:51.718
I had you all over here for dinner.

51:51.885 --> 51:53.428

52:07.693 --> 52:09.068
That's all he got out of him.

Do yo? think he has anything to do
with the guy that We shot?

52:12.823 --> 52:14.699
Well' did he say anything else?

52:14.867 --> 52:18.119
Sa?l mentioned something about
"going to the casino."

52:18.287 --> 52:20.455
- Weird.
- "Going to the casino"?

52:20.622 --> 52:22.707
The Asians own the casino' Ted.

- I need another beer.

52:26.795 --> 52:30.214

- D?de' you smell like shit.

54:45.726 --> 54:48.394
- Dale' what happened to yo??
- I was in the woods.

54:48.562 --> 54:51.731
- In the Woods?
- Yeah. Isn't that weird? I was...

54:51.899 --> 54:53.774
- I was in the woods.

54:53.942 --> 54:56.277
I bird-watch. I don't.

54:56.445 --> 54:59.363
?o, I don't.
Look, I'm gonna come clean.

55:00.532 --> 55:03.201

55:03.368 --> 55:05.286
I saW someone

55:05.454 --> 55:07.955
...and I think
they've been following me.

55:08.123 --> 55:10.416
There's a good chance
they went to my apartment...

55:10.584 --> 55:12.293
...where Angie has a lot of things.

55:12.461 --> 55:15.421
?er yearbooks, report cards'
her cell n?mber is written...

55:15.589 --> 55:16.881
...and it's on my fridge.

55:17.049 --> 55:19.675
So they co?ld then find this ho?se.
They could come here.

55:19.843 --> 55:21.552
We sho?ld call the police
right away.

55:21.720 --> 55:23.804
We can't. The police
were the murderers.

55:23.972 --> 55:26.515
We can't call the police.
They were the murderers.

55:26.683 --> 55:29.352
Angie' I swear to God'
yo? do something or I'm gonna...

55:29.519 --> 55:31.604

55:38.278 --> 55:40.780
- Are you high?
- What? ?o. I'm not high. Why...?

55:40.948 --> 55:42.782
Yo? are high as a fucking kite.

55:42.950 --> 55:44.408
I'm not high. Let's go.

55:44.576 --> 55:46.661
We're not going.

55:46.828 --> 55:49.080
Yo? know what I'm coming back with?

56:31.748 --> 56:33.874
Is this where you're parked?
Let's sally forth.

56:34.042 --> 56:35.459
Who is after you, after Angie?

56:35.627 --> 56:39.046
They're dr?g dealers. I have reason
to believe that they're drug dealers.

56:39.213 --> 56:41.673
What are you talking about?
Yo?'re out of your mind.

56:41.841 --> 56:44.259

56:44.427 --> 56:47.846

57:18.544 --> 57:20.420
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

57:20.588 --> 57:22.547
- ?e's with me.

57:22.715 --> 57:25.092

57:25.259 --> 57:27.010
Yo? assholes

57:27.178 --> 57:29.972

57:30.139 --> 57:31.890

57:38.106 --> 57:40.607

57:40.775 --> 57:43.485
Kill motherf?ckers With my hands.

57:44.862 --> 57:48.031
Get out your goddamn gun.
Yo?'re making me uncomfortable.

57:58.668 --> 58:00.627
Anybody o?t there?

58:03.631 --> 58:06.091

58:15.810 --> 58:17.019
Love it.

58:17.186 --> 58:19.438
I found a bloody fork.

58:20.648 --> 58:23.233
It's f?cking freaky, man.
They could still be here.

58:23.401 --> 58:25.652

58:26.696 --> 58:29.031

Get out of my car.
I can't believe you think it's an option.

58:38.708 --> 58:40.834
Okay. Okay. That makes sense.

So get this:

59:54.408 --> 59:55.992
We triang?lated the cells.

59:56.160 --> 59:59.746
They smashed one, threw the other
in the woods to try to distract us.

59:59.914 --> 01:00:01.915
It took an hour for Jared to find it.

01:00:02.083 --> 01:00:04.793
And then he said
that he fo?nd Denton's car...

01:00:04.961 --> 01:00:07.337
...filled with all these
strange disg?ises.

01:00:07.505 --> 01:00:10.757
A powdered wig,
a sombrero' leotards.

01:00:10.925 --> 01:00:12.801
I mean, What the fuck
does that mean?

01:00:12.969 --> 01:00:15.470
Why don't I just call the Asians

01:00:15.638 --> 01:00:17.931

Record this conversation.

01:00:33.865 --> 01:00:37.617

01:00:37.785 --> 01:00:41.788
Well' Cheung' my friend,

01:00:41.956 --> 01:00:45.876
Yo? know, we both know

01:00:50.214 --> 01:00:53.383
...made a little decoration

01:00:53.551 --> 01:00:56.928
We painted the wall with his brain.
Painted it.

01:00:57.096 --> 01:01:00.765
And noW this Dale Denton guy?
Yo? serious?

01:01:00.933 --> 01:01:04.519

01:01:04.687 --> 01:01:05.937

01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:12.277
Dad! Get off the phone. I told you

01:01:12.445 --> 01:01:14.946
...and this is the time.

01:01:15.114 --> 01:01:17.365
...so you wo?ld stay off mine.
Get off the phone.

01:01:17.533 --> 01:01:20.994
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm not a little kid, I'm a man!

01:01:21.162 --> 01:01:24.581
And from this point forward, I'm
not taking any of your fucking shit.

01:01:24.749 --> 01:01:29.044
I love you, Dad, but the dynamic
in our relationship is about to change.

01:01:29.212 --> 01:01:31.463
Troy, do me a favor'
get oft the fucking phone!

01:01:32.048 --> 01:01:35.175
- Shit.

01:01:35.343 --> 01:01:37.344
So?nds like a very nice boy.

01:01:37.511 --> 01:01:40.305
All right, you listen to me, Cheung,

01:01:40.473 --> 01:01:42.933
It is on! We're coming at you
with everything we got!

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.644
It's on, so you better get your head
o?t of your ass...

01:01:45.811 --> 01:01:47.479
...and be ready for everything!

01:01:47.647 --> 01:01:49.522
Yo? are f?cking dead!

01:01:50.650 --> 01:01:51.775
Yo? are so dumb.

01:01:51.943 --> 01:01:55.445
Do yo? have any idea
how Weak you just made ?s look?

01:01:56.906 --> 01:01:59.991
Goddamn it!

01:02:00.326 --> 01:02:01.660
Totally sweet.

01:02:02.078 --> 01:02:04.371
Ted Jones is slipping.

01:02:04.538 --> 01:02:08.166
We shall strike now with full force.

01:02:09.335 --> 01:02:12.087
Yo?r brother's death
will not be in vain.

01:02:14.632 --> 01:02:18.260
I gotta say, I've had, like,
a lot of weed dealers in my day.

01:02:18.427 --> 01:02:21.012
Yo?'re the coolest I've ever had.
They were all dicks.

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:23.682
- Really? Thanks' man.
- ?o problem.

01:02:23.849 --> 01:02:26.309
I really appreciate it.
That means a lot to me.

01:02:26.477 --> 01:02:30.272
It's' like, you're the first guy that I ever
sold to that I became friends with.

01:02:30.439 --> 01:02:34.359
They say, like, "Don't dip the pen
in company ink."

01:02:34.527 --> 01:02:37.529
I'm totally glad
I dipped in your ink, bro.

01:02:38.739 --> 01:02:40.240
Yeah.

01:02:42.868 --> 01:02:45.537
We sho?ld get out of town.
That's probably our next move.

01:02:45.705 --> 01:02:47.372
Just get on a bus and leave, right?

01:02:48.249 --> 01:02:49.541
Get bus tickets.

01:02:49.709 --> 01:02:53.169
Go to the next toWn.

01:02:53.337 --> 01:02:55.588
Yo? know what I was saying?
Like, I'm totally...

01:02:55.756 --> 01:02:57.716
Yo?'re glad yo? dipped yo?r pen

01:02:57.883 --> 01:03:00.051
But We should get bus tickets

01:03:00.219 --> 01:03:01.428

01:03:01.595 --> 01:03:04.723
Get on the bus? Leave?

01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:08.226

I don't think that'll even buy one ticket.

01:03:08.811 --> 01:03:10.103
What abo?t yo?r sack?

01:03:10.271 --> 01:03:13.148
Oh' man' it's f?cking killing me.
I feel like I popped one.

01:03:14.358 --> 01:03:17.277
?o. That's ?nfort?nate,

01:03:21.324 --> 01:03:22.991
...get some cash

01:03:23.159 --> 01:03:27.203
- Of co?rse, man. That's what I do.

What's this stuff called again?

01:03:44.597 --> 01:03:46.598
Pineapple Express.
They said it eight times.

01:03:46.766 --> 01:03:49.976
- Yeah, b?t don't call it that.
- Yeah, that's not what it's called.

01:03:50.144 --> 01:03:53.021
- Call it Banana Boat.

01:03:53.189 --> 01:03:56.107
This can be a gateway dr?g.
Don't wanna move on to other things.

01:03:56.275 --> 01:03:58.777
- Cocaine. Don't do that.
- We don't f?ck around.

01:03:58.944 --> 01:04:02.989
- Don't worry. Don't tell ?s what to do.
- Inhale it, Chachi. Inhale it.

01:04:03.157 --> 01:04:04.574

01:04:29.725 --> 01:04:33.395
- Keep it on the down-low.

01:04:33.562 --> 01:04:37.732

I have horrible anorexia,
and it helps my appetite. I'm so sorry.

01:05:18.232 --> 01:05:23.027
Look, selling narcotics to my students

Angie' you have exhibited
poor decision-making skills.

01:10:44.892 --> 01:10:45.892
Oh' this is my fa?lt.

01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:48.812

Yo? don't see that

- You loWered yo?r expectations...
...of what yo? are worthy of.

01:10:56.988 --> 01:10:59.906
...but this guy is so far beneath you.
Yo? deserve much better.

01:11:00.074 --> 01:11:02.075
Open your heart
to someone who deserves you.

01:11:02.243 --> 01:11:04.286
Or don't have a boyfriend

01:11:04.453 --> 01:11:06.246

01:11:06.414 --> 01:11:08.039

01:11:08.207 --> 01:11:10.875

I can't believe I'm in this situation
right now because of you...

01:12:43.217 --> 01:12:46.094
...and your addiction to marijuana.
I cannot believe I'm here.

01:12:46.262 --> 01:12:47.804
I can't be addicted to marijuana.

01:12:47.972 --> 01:12:51.141
A, I ?se a bong. It filters o?t

This, that's happening between us,
this is normal.

01:12:58.482 --> 01:13:00.984
This happens to every co?ple
dating for three months.

01:13:01.152 --> 01:13:02.652
- We have to work through it.
- ?o.

01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:04.279

01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:18.919
It means that you are gonna go

01:13:19.086 --> 01:13:21.171

You never did like me anyway,

01:13:35.061 --> 01:13:36.603
You didn't wanna meet my parents.

01:13:36.771 --> 01:13:39.356
I always cared about you.
That's not what this is. Okay?

01:13:39.523 --> 01:13:40.774

Why do you never act

?o, I'll give you more,

01:14:01.337 --> 01:14:03.546
I know' I'm sorry about the clocks.

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:27.028
Why not? Car chase' gunshots.

That clearly just happened...

01:14:28.823 --> 01:14:31.157
...beca?se we were smoking

01:14:31.325 --> 01:14:33.326
?o, man. It happened

01:14:33.494 --> 01:14:35.662
...co?ldn't keep their shit
on the down-low.

01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:38.665
In case yo? haven't noticed...
Which you haven't.

01:14:38.833 --> 01:14:41.334
From what I can tell,
yo? don't notice anything ever.

01:14:41.502 --> 01:14:44.838
- We are not very f?nctional when
we're high. Which is all the time.

01:14:45.006 --> 01:14:47.757
Well' I don't know, man.
I think I'm functioning right noW.

01:14:47.925 --> 01:14:50.760
I was, like' stoned when I saved yo?

01:14:50.928 --> 01:14:52.345
What do yo? gotta say to that?

01:14:52.513 --> 01:14:55.098
Well' that would be true
if you had saved me.

01:14:55.266 --> 01:14:56.391
But you didn't save me.

01:14:56.559 --> 01:14:58.476
She was gonna help'
yo? made things Worse.

01:14:58.644 --> 01:15:00.520
We're wanted
for all sorts of crazy shit.

01:15:00.688 --> 01:15:02.689
Don't fucking get on my case'
all right?

01:15:02.857 --> 01:15:04.524
Only reason I started selling pot...

01:15:04.692 --> 01:15:07.277
...is so I co?ld p?t my bubbe
in a nice retirement home.

01:15:07.445 --> 01:15:09.612
- She m?st be pro?d of you.
- She is pro?d of me.

01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:11.114
I'm gonna become something.

01:15:11.282 --> 01:15:13.825
As soon as she dies,
I'm gonna become a civil engineer.

01:15:13.993 --> 01:15:16.327
I'm gonna design septic tanks
for playgrounds.

01:15:16.495 --> 01:15:17.996
Little kids can take shits.

01:15:18.164 --> 01:15:19.789
Yo? idiot. What the hell do you do?

01:15:19.957 --> 01:15:22.042
What am I gonna do?
Besides stay in my home...

01:15:22.209 --> 01:15:24.794
...for fear that you've designed
some object I'm around?

01:15:24.962 --> 01:15:28.173
I'm gonna be on the radio,
talking abo?t life.

01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:30.759
- Giving lessons about life.
- Put me in my place.

01:15:30.926 --> 01:15:33.428
I'm gonna be designing buildings
and what's he doing?

01:15:33.596 --> 01:15:35.430
Boring people to death on the radio.

01:15:35.598 --> 01:15:39.225
Yo? are an asshole.
That's all you are. Yo?'re an asshole.

01:15:39.393 --> 01:15:41.227
- I'm not an asshole.
- You are an asshole.

01:15:41.395 --> 01:15:44.397
I feel pretty s?re
that I'm not an asshole.

01:15:44.565 --> 01:15:46.191
I'm, like' a totally nice guy.

01:15:46.358 --> 01:15:48.860
I'm just as nice as yo? are.
So don't bring that out.

01:15:49.028 --> 01:15:50.820
In the woods, I gave you my jacket.

01:15:50.988 --> 01:15:53.323
Yo? were cold and I clothed you.

01:15:53.783 --> 01:15:57.077
?ow about in the park
when I said that yo? were my friend?

01:15:57.244 --> 01:15:58.912
Yo? didn't say anything back.

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.623
Well' that's easy.
It's beca?se we're not friends.

01:16:01.791 --> 01:16:03.249
Yo? are my dr?g dealer.

01:16:03.417 --> 01:16:05.168
There's one reason
we know each other.

01:16:05.336 --> 01:16:07.378
I like the drugs you sell. That's it.

01:16:07.546 --> 01:16:10.757
If yo? didn't sell those drugs'
I would have no idea who you Were...

01:16:10.925 --> 01:16:14.094
...and I would be fantastic right now.
Instead of looking like this.

01:16:16.055 --> 01:16:19.057
That so?nded mean.
Just hearing it so?nded mean.

01:16:19.225 --> 01:16:20.767
- I didn't mean to say...
- It's out.

01:16:20.935 --> 01:16:23.394
Monkey's o?t of the bottle' man.

01:16:23.562 --> 01:16:25.605
What? That's not even
an expression.

01:16:25.773 --> 01:16:28.483
Pandora doesn't go back in the box.
?e only comes out.

01:16:28.651 --> 01:16:30.527
I'm sorry, man. Look...

01:16:30.986 --> 01:16:34.489

- ?ere. ?ave a nice last meal.

01:16:34.657 --> 01:16:37.242
Come on, man. Don't do that.

01:16:37.409 --> 01:16:39.494
Why don't yo? supersize it, bitch?

01:16:39.662 --> 01:16:42.080
I'm sorry, man. Look, come back.

01:16:42.248 --> 01:16:44.457
I didn't mean that.

01:16:56.887 --> 01:16:59.639
I love you. Do you love me?

01:17:42.641 --> 01:17:44.267
That looks great.

01:17:51.901 --> 01:17:53.359
?ello?

01:17:54.445 --> 01:17:55.737
Dale?

01:17:55.905 --> 01:17:57.280
It is Dale.

01:17:57.448 --> 01:18:02.327
Angie' I'm calling because I love you
more than anything in the World...

01:18:02.494 --> 01:18:05.914
...and I wanna let yo? knoW
I'll do anything to make it work.

01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:07.832
I'll do anything.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.586
I've had a near-death experience'
and when that happens...

01:18:11.754 --> 01:18:14.464
...yo? can prioritize yo?r life,
and yo? are it' okay?

01:18:14.632 --> 01:18:16.799
So please

01:18:16.967 --> 01:18:19.052
- I love you.
- I love yo?.

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:23.389
- Yeah?
- I just don't wanna lose you, Dale.

01:18:23.557 --> 01:18:27.018
We were driving away from the house
and I just kept thinking...

01:18:27.186 --> 01:18:28.394
I don't knoW. I just...

01:18:28.562 --> 01:18:29.979
I wanna marry yo?.

01:18:33.067 --> 01:18:34.734
I made a mistake.

01:18:34.902 --> 01:18:37.237
- What do you mean?
- I've...

01:18:37.655 --> 01:18:40.073
- What?
- I'm just processing that last bit.

01:18:40.241 --> 01:18:42.825
- You wanna... Oh, fuck.
- What?

01:18:42.993 --> 01:18:44.577
I don't knoW.

01:18:44.745 --> 01:18:46.871
I realize now
that if you Wo?ld take me back...

01:18:47.039 --> 01:18:48.957
...then you are very naive
and immature.

01:18:49.124 --> 01:18:52.710
Yo? don't see what a f?ck-up I am.
I'm in no shape to be dated by anyone.

01:18:52.878 --> 01:18:56.005
- You're the one that's immature.
- I'm not immature. ?ou're immature.

01:18:56.173 --> 01:18:59.384
I am somewhat immature,
but you're more immature. I'm older.

01:18:59.551 --> 01:19:00.843
Just beca?se you're older.

01:19:01.011 --> 01:19:03.554
I lost my virginity
when I was 14 years old.

01:19:03.722 --> 01:19:05.890
- Really?
- ?ow many girls have yo? slept with?

01:19:06.058 --> 01:19:08.142
- Like, two and a half.
- Two and a half?

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:09.519
What is a half? Yo?r hand?

01:19:09.687 --> 01:19:12.605
No, it was the tip or I dipped a ball in.
I can't remember why.

01:19:12.773 --> 01:19:15.441
I remember thinking,
"This doesn't count as a full point."

01:19:15.609 --> 01:19:17.986
If I said three, I'd feel like a liar.
I was drunk.

01:19:18.153 --> 01:19:19.487
Screw you.

01:19:19.655 --> 01:19:20.822

01:19:26.245 --> 01:19:30.039
Oh' thank goodness. Okay.

Yeah, these tWo guys came in...

01:20:27.014 --> 01:20:30.016
...they sat down with me

01:20:30.184 --> 01:20:32.268
I never saw them in my life before.

01:20:32.436 --> 01:20:35.605
And they kept asking questions
abo?t my grandson.

01:20:35.773 --> 01:20:40.234
- What did they look like?
- One of them was very tall and sloppy.

01:20:40.402 --> 01:20:44.197
And the other g?y'
he was very good-looking...

01:20:44.365 --> 01:20:45.698

01:20:45.866 --> 01:20:47.784
But the Worst part was...

01:20:47.951 --> 01:20:52.330

Sa?l is a good d?de.

01:24:28.422 --> 01:24:29.505
I was mean to him' man.

01:24:29.673 --> 01:24:32.425
I wronged him and I can't...
I can't let it end like that.

01:24:32.593 --> 01:24:36.262
I'm just into B?ddhism
and I'm at peace with the fact...

01:24:36.430 --> 01:24:40.308
...that me as this person,
probably gonna not be around.

01:24:40.475 --> 01:24:42.435
Think abo?t a hermit crab, okay?

01:24:42.603 --> 01:24:46.564
And it's a shell' and it's like
they go from one shell to the next.

01:24:46.732 --> 01:24:50.860
And that's what I am. It's like
I'm just a hermit crab changing shells.

01:24:51.028 --> 01:24:53.404
Except' if yo?'re a dick
yo?r Whole life...

01:24:53.572 --> 01:24:56.449
...yo?r next shell
will be made of shit' okay?

01:24:56.617 --> 01:24:59.368
If yo?'re an asshole, yo?'re gonna
come back as a cockroach.

01:24:59.536 --> 01:25:03.289
Or a Worm,
or a fucking anal bead, okay?

01:25:03.457 --> 01:25:05.833
If yo?'re a man'
and yo? act heroic...

01:25:06.001 --> 01:25:07.585
...yo?'ll come back as an eagle.

01:25:07.753 --> 01:25:09.295
Yo?'ll come back as a dragon.

01:25:09.463 --> 01:25:11.130
Yo?'ll come back as Jude Law.

01:25:11.965 --> 01:25:14.133
Okay? Which would yo? rather be?

01:25:14.301 --> 01:25:17.637
Maybe the anal bead. Might...
Depending on who it belongs to.

01:25:17.804 --> 01:25:18.846
It belongs to me.

01:25:19.014 --> 01:25:20.473
- Then the dragon.
- Exactly.

01:25:20.641 --> 01:25:24.477
Yo? need to help me, okay?
Just ?se it' you know? Use the pain.

01:25:24.645 --> 01:25:25.853
Yo?'ll have a second wind.

01:25:26.021 --> 01:25:28.439
Let's get up
and go get Sa?l back. Use it.

01:25:28.607 --> 01:25:31.275
- Aren't you angry at Ted?
- Yeah, I'm really mad at him.

01:25:31.443 --> 01:25:34.612
What do yo? wanna do? Don't yo?
wanna get ?p, do something about it?

01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:37.073
Maybe that would be cool
to do to him.

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:38.908
I don't think "maybe" is the answer.

01:25:39.076 --> 01:25:41.369
I think' "Yes, I'm gonna
help you' Dale"...

01:25:41.536 --> 01:25:43.329
...that's the answer I'm looking for.

01:25:44.956 --> 01:25:46.332

01:26:03.725 --> 01:26:04.975

01:26:08.021 --> 01:26:10.106
...and shoot my face off, okay?
- I'm sorry.

01:26:17.072 --> 01:26:19.782
I ?sed to use this little gun
when I was a prostit?te.

01:26:24.788 --> 01:26:27.873
Don't.

01:26:28.041 --> 01:26:29.709

01:50:36.448 --> 01:50:38.824
At the time, I was like:
But it was kind of funny.

01:50:38.992 --> 01:50:41.535
Yo? hit me with a DustBuster' man.

01:50:41.703 --> 01:50:44.830
I didn't Wanna hurt you.
It was like' "Yo? better not leave here."

01:50:44.998 --> 01:50:46.999
- That was s?ch a good fight, man.
- That was.

01:50:47.167 --> 01:50:48.626
Yo? fuckhead.

01:50:48.793 --> 01:50:51.337
- The car chase was awesome.
- You got into a car chase?

01:50:51.505 --> 01:50:54.131
- Are you kidding me? Oh' my God.
- Yeah, it was...

01:50:54.299 --> 01:50:57.218
I, like' had my foot
through the window.

01:50:57.385 --> 01:51:01.430
My groin... I mean,
I felt like a wishbone.

01:51:03.183 --> 01:51:06.393
- I j?st feel different about everything.
- Me too, man. Everything.

01:51:06.561 --> 01:51:08.646
Like, I never Wanna
kill anybody else again.

01:51:08.813 --> 01:51:10.689
- Ever.
- That's something yo? pretty m?ch...

01:51:10.857 --> 01:51:12.691
Yo? can just kind of
dip your toes into.

01:51:12.859 --> 01:51:14.735
We kind of dipped o?r toes
into m?rder.

01:51:14.903 --> 01:51:17.363
I killed six guys, I think.
?ow many g?ys did you...?

01:51:17.531 --> 01:51:19.406
- We each shot several people.
- A lot.

01:51:19.574 --> 01:51:21.575
Some people get a taste for it'
b?t I don't.

01:51:21.743 --> 01:51:24.870
I shot someone who was already dead
so that doesn't co?nt as a murder.

01:51:25.038 --> 01:51:27.206
Apparently yo? hit him
with your car, I'm told.

01:51:27.374 --> 01:51:29.917
- That... You killed him.
- Okay, so I did murder somebody.

01:51:30.085 --> 01:51:32.419
- You m?rdered, man.
- ?ot a big deal. That's cool.

01:51:32.587 --> 01:51:35.172
- That's cool. Whatever. Kill or be killed.
- I know.

01:51:35.340 --> 01:51:37.132
I'm trying to decide
how stoned I am...

01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:39.510
...and just how on the verge
of death am I now.

01:51:39.678 --> 01:51:43.138
Am I seeing shit because I'm stoned
or beca?se I have no blood leff?

01:51:43.306 --> 01:51:46.141
- You've been shot' like, seven times.
- You gotta eat.

01:51:46.309 --> 01:51:48.060
- You're losing stuft.
- Yeah.

01:51:48.228 --> 01:51:50.104
- ?ere.
- Yeah, okay.

01:51:50.272 --> 01:51:53.732
- ?ere comes the airplane.
- Look, like a baby.

01:51:55.944 --> 01:51:58.404
It's a miracle.
I think We should all take a moment...

01:51:58.572 --> 01:52:01.156
...and think about what a miracle
it is that we got out.

01:52:01.324 --> 01:52:03.325
And that we became friends
in the process...

01:52:03.493 --> 01:52:05.744
...and learned some shit about life
and st?ff.

01:52:05.912 --> 01:52:10.124
Should we to?ch each other's hands
while We do it? Okay.

01:52:12.168 --> 01:52:13.585
I love you g?ys.

01:52:13.753 --> 01:52:16.129
I love you d?des so much.

01:52:19.050 --> 01:52:21.718
I'll remember that
for the rest of my life.

01:52:22.595 --> 01:52:24.054
- Red?
- Red?

01:52:24.222 --> 01:52:26.223
Yo, Red, man. You alive?

01:52:26.391 --> 01:52:27.724
What's ?p, pal?

01:52:28.643 --> 01:52:30.143
- ?ey.
- ?ey.

01:52:30.311 --> 01:52:34.022
I'm like the nerd at the sleepover
who fell asleep at 9.

01:52:34.190 --> 01:52:36.441
That's okay. We Won't put
o?r dicks in yo?r mouth.

01:52:36.609 --> 01:52:40.070
- Oh' God.
- ?ey' there's bubbe.

01:52:40.238 --> 01:52:42.364
Come on. Let's get out of here.

01:52:42.532 --> 01:52:44.449
Yeah, maybe
we should go to the doctor.

01:52:44.617 --> 01:52:46.743
Do yo? think she'll drive me
to the hospital?

01:52:46.911 --> 01:52:48.829
Me too. I sho?ld
get the ear looked at.

01:52:48.996 --> 01:52:51.248
My ear should probably
get professional attention.

01:52:51.416 --> 01:52:53.500
- It is bad.
- That's a bullet b?rp.

01:52:53.668 --> 01:52:56.712
Either I'm getting ready to die
or I'm gonna take a massive shit.

01:52:56.879 --> 01:52:58.755
If somebody could get me
to the hospital.

01:52:58.923 --> 01:53:00.507
Blood from my ear just...

01:53:00.675 --> 01:53:03.468
Yo? guys smell like shit.

01:53:04.679 --> 01:53:07.347
Yo? are in serio?s danger.
