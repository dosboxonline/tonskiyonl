Never mind that. There's a Mr Bingley

- Perchance.

- the beauty of the county.
- JANE: No, Mama. Mama, please.

12:34.110 --> 12:36.070
When she was only 15 there was a gentleman

so much in love with her that I was sure

12:38.865 --> 12:40.157
he would make her an offer.

12:40.242 --> 12:43.911
However, he did write her
some very pretty verses.

the power of poetry

will kill it stone dead.

- Handsome, conveniently rich.

13:35.086 --> 13:36.878
You know perfectly well
I do not believe marriage

13:36.963 --> 13:38.839
- should be driven by a lot of money.
- I agree entirely.

13:38.923 --> 13:40.966
Only the deepest love
will persuade me into matrimony,

13:41.050 --> 13:43.093

13:43.177 --> 13:45.095

13:47.515 --> 13:49.600

his vanity had he not wounded mine.

of me returning home until I am better.

16:37.847 --> 16:40.182
"Do not be alarmed.
Excepting a sore throat, a fever

16:40.266 --> 16:42.476
"and a headache, there is
nothing much wrong with me."

16:42.769 --> 16:43.852
This is ridiculous.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.604
Well, if Jane does die,

16:45.688 --> 16:48.023
it will be a comfort to know
it was in pursuit of Mr Bingley.

16:48.107 --> 16:50.692
People do not die of colds.

16:50.777 --> 16:54.154

with the shame of having such a mother.

16:54.238 --> 16:55.280
(SNICKERING)

16:55.364 --> 16:57.407

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

17:11.378 --> 17:14.089
Apparently, Lady Bathurst
is redecorating her ballroom

17:14.174 --> 17:15.965
in the French style.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.551
A little unpatriotic, don't you think?

17:21.932 --> 17:23.848
Miss Elizabeth Bennet.

17:38.739 --> 17:41.407
Good Lord, Miss Elizabeth.
Did you walk here?

17:41.617 --> 17:42.826
I did.

17:50.292 --> 17:53.002
- I'm so sorry. How is my sister?
- She's upstairs.

17:56.715 --> 17:58.049
Thank you.

18:08.435 --> 18:10.854
CAROLINE: My goodness,
did you see her hem?

18:11.105 --> 18:15.440
Six inches deep in mud.
She looked positively medieval.

18:16.276 --> 18:20.320
I feel such a terrible imposition,
they're being so kind to me.

18:20.446 --> 18:22.239
Don't worry.
I don't know who is more pleased

18:22.323 --> 18:24.908
at your being here, Mama or Mr Bingley.

(LAUGHING)

18:26.202 --> 18:27.244
(MOANS)

18:27.328 --> 18:28.370
Oh.

18:31.624 --> 18:33.542
Thank you for tending to my sister
so diligently.

18:33.626 --> 18:36.336
She is in far better comfort here
than she would have been at home.

18:36.421 --> 18:37.963
It's a pleasure.

18:38.923 --> 18:39.923
I mean it's... Sorry.

18:40.008 --> 18:42.301
Not a pleasure that she's ill, of course not.

18:42.468 --> 18:45.304
It's a pleasure that she's here, being ill.

(PIG GRUNTING)

18:49.600 --> 18:51.475

Back of the back, not related
to the learnt pig of Norwich.

18:55.606 --> 18:56.564
Now, that pig is...

18:56.648 --> 18:57.732
- Mr Bennet.
- Yes.

18:58.483 --> 19:00.318
It's all going according to plan.

19:00.402 --> 19:02.028
He's half in love with her already.

19:02.112 --> 19:04.405
- Who is, blossom?
- Mr Bingley.

19:04.489 --> 19:06.449
And he doesn't mind a bit
that she hasn't a penny,

19:06.533 --> 19:08.701
for he has more than enough for the two of them.

19:09.119 --> 19:11.329
KITTY: How will we meet them?
LYDIA: It's easy.

19:11.496 --> 19:12.747
Wait for me.

19:12.998 --> 19:17.460

and then you're introduced.

(GASPS)

19:59.292 --> 20:02.544
You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.

20:02.796 --> 20:04.838
You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.

20:04.965 --> 20:08.384
How many letters you must have
occasion to write, Mr Darcy.

20:08.718 --> 20:11.762
Letters of business, too.
How odious I should think them.

20:11.846 --> 20:13.681
It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot

20:13.765 --> 20:14.807
instead of yours.

20:14.891 --> 20:17.309
Do tell your sister that I long to see her.

20:17.560 --> 20:19.144
I've already told her once, by your desire.

20:19.229 --> 20:20.813
CAROLINE: I do dote on her.

20:20.939 --> 20:22.022
I was quite in raptures

20:22.107 --> 20:24.441
at her beautiful little design for a table.

20:24.567 --> 20:26.819
Perhaps you will give me leave
to defer your raptures

20:26.903 --> 20:27.945
till I write again?

20:28.029 --> 20:29.738
At present, I have not room enough
to do them justice.

20:29.823 --> 20:31.490
BINGLEY: Well, I think it's amazing
you young ladies

20:31.574 --> 20:33.366
have the patience to be so accomplished.

20:33.450 --> 20:34.826
What do you mean, Charles?

20:34.910 --> 20:37.286
You all paint tables and play the piano

20:37.371 --> 20:39.247
and embroider cushions.

20:39.373 --> 20:42.083
I never heard of a young lady
but people say she is accomplished.

20:42.167 --> 20:43.960
DARCY: The word is indeed applied
too liberally.

20:44.044 --> 20:46.212
I cannot boast of knowing more than
half a dozen women

20:46.296 --> 20:48.172
in all my acquaintance
that are truly accomplished.

20:48.257 --> 20:49.674
CAROLINE: Nor I, to be sure.

20:49.758 --> 20:52.593
Goodness. You must comprehend
a great deal in the idea.

20:52.928 --> 20:54.595
- I do.
- CAROLINE: Absolutely.

20:55.097 --> 20:57.974
She must have a thorough knowledge
of music, singing, drawing,

20:58.058 --> 21:01.269
dancing and the modern languages,
to deserve the word.

21:02.104 --> 21:05.398
And something in her air and manner of walking.

21:06.150 --> 21:09.109
And, of course, she must improve
her mind by extensive reading.

21:09.193 --> 21:12.237
I'm no longer surprised at your
knowing only six accomplished women.

21:12.321 --> 21:14.448
I rather wonder now at your knowing any.

21:14.532 --> 21:18.285
- Are you so severe on your own sex?
- I never saw such a woman.

21:19.162 --> 21:21.288
She would certainly be
a fearsome thing to behold.

21:24.042 --> 21:27.252
CAROLINE: Miss Elizabeth,
let us take a turn about the room.

21:44.561 --> 21:46.437
It's refreshing, is it not,

21:46.521 --> 21:49.065
after sitting so long in one attitude?

21:49.524 --> 21:52.109
And it is a small kind
of accomplishment, I suppose.

21:52.778 --> 21:54.987
Will you not join us, Mr Darcy?

21:55.197 --> 21:57.281
You can only have two motives, Caroline,

21:57.365 --> 21:58.908
and I would interfere with either.

21:58.992 --> 22:00.242
What can he mean?

22:00.327 --> 22:03.996
Our surest way of disappointing him
will be to ask him nothing about it.

22:04.122 --> 22:05.998
But do tell us, Mr Darcy.

22:09.377 --> 22:11.212
Either you are in each other's confidence

22:11.296 --> 22:14.131
and you have secret affairs to discuss,

22:14.216 --> 22:16.967
or you are conscious that your figures

22:17.177 --> 22:19.761
appear to the greatest advantage by walking.

22:21.263 --> 22:23.932
If the first, I should get in your way.

22:24.225 --> 22:26.476
If the second, I can admire you
much better from here.

22:26.560 --> 22:27.560
Shocking.

22:27.645 --> 22:28.603
(BINGLEY LAUGHING)

22:28.687 --> 22:30.271
How shall we punish him for such a speech?

22:30.356 --> 22:31.439
We could always laugh at him.

22:31.524 --> 22:34.150
Oh, no, Mr Darcy is not to be teased.

22:34.401 --> 22:36.486
Are you too proud, Mr Darcy?

22:36.821 --> 22:38.947
And would you consider pride
a fault or a virtue?

22:39.031 --> 22:40.156
That I couldn't say.

22:40.241 --> 22:42.200
Because we're doing our best
to find fault in you.

22:42.284 --> 22:43.785
Maybe it's that I find it hard to forgive

22:43.869 --> 22:46.871
the follies and vices of others,
or their of fences against me.

22:47.331 --> 22:50.166
My good opinion, once lost, is lost forever.

22:52.877 --> 22:55.462
Oh, dear, I cannot tease you about that.

22:56.464 --> 22:58.799
What a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.

22:58.925 --> 23:00.884
CAROLINE: A family trait, I think.

23:29.413 --> 23:31.372
A Mrs Bennet, a Miss Bennet,

23:31.456 --> 23:34.542
a Miss Bennet, and a Miss Bennet, sir.

23:34.626 --> 23:36.043
Oh, for heaven's sake, are we to receive

23:36.128 --> 23:38.087
every Bennet in the country?

23:40.632 --> 23:43.551
What an excellent room you have, sir.

23:44.261 --> 23:46.888
Such expensive furnishings.

23:47.931 --> 23:50.975
Oh, I do hope you intend
to stay here, Mr Bingley.

23:51.059 --> 23:53.769
Absolutely. I find the country very diverting.

23:54.354 --> 23:55.771
Don't you agree, Darcy?

23:56.148 --> 23:58.107
I find it perfectly adequate,

23:58.400 --> 24:01.110
even if society's
a little less varied than in town.

24:01.195 --> 24:03.028
MRS BENNET: Less varied? Not at all.

24:03.196 --> 24:06.865
We dine with four and twenty
families of all shapes and sizes.

24:07.408 --> 24:11.411
Sir William Lucas, for instance,
is a very agreeable man

24:12.079 --> 24:15.916
and a good deal less self-important
than some people half his rank.

24:16.834 --> 24:18.793
LYDIA: Mr Bingley, is it true
that you've promised

24:18.878 --> 24:21.296
- to hold a ball here at Netherfield?
- A ball?

24:21.631 --> 24:23.798
It would be an excellent way
to meet new friends.

24:23.883 --> 24:26.426
You could invite the militia.
They're excellent company.

24:26.510 --> 24:28.511
- Oh, do hold a ball.
- ELIZABETH: Kitty.

24:29.805 --> 24:32.390
When your sister is recovered,
you shall name the day.

24:32.475 --> 24:34.726
I think a ball is a perfectly irrational way

24:34.810 --> 24:36.311
to gain new acquaintance.

24:36.520 --> 24:39.396
It would be better if conversation,
instead of dancing,

24:39.481 --> 24:40.814
were the order of the day.

24:40.899 --> 24:44.026
Indeed, much more rational,
but rather less like a ball.

24:45.028 --> 24:46.654
Thank you, Mary.

24:47.822 --> 24:51.867
MRS BENNET: What a fine, imposing place
it is, to be sure, is it not, my dears?

24:52.160 --> 24:55.037
There's no house to equal it in the county.

24:55.705 --> 24:57.414
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Bennet.

24:57.499 --> 24:58.791
There she is.

24:59.084 --> 25:00.668
Mr Bingley, I don't know how to thank you.

25:00.752 --> 25:03.462
You're welcome any time
you feel the least bit poorly.

25:03.713 --> 25:05.339
Thank you for your stimulating company.

25:05.423 --> 25:06.924
It has been most instructive.

25:07.008 --> 25:09.426
Not at all. The pleasure is all mine.

25:13.389 --> 25:15.515
- Mr Darcy.
- Miss Elizabeth.

25:27.528 --> 25:30.905
And then, there was one
with great long lashes like a cow.

25:30.990 --> 25:32.782
LYDIA: Did you see him?
He looked right at me.

25:32.866 --> 25:35.618
MRS BENNET: Ask Mrs Hill
to order us a sirloin, Betsy.

25:35.703 --> 25:38.204
Just the one, mind, we're not made of money.

25:39.290 --> 25:41.457
(PIANO PLAYING)

25:41.542 --> 25:44.836
I hope, my dear,
you've ordered a good dinner today.

25:45.587 --> 25:49.089
I have reason to expect an addition
to our family party.

25:49.757 --> 25:52.092
ELIZABETH: His name is Mr Collins.
He's the dreaded cousin.

25:52.176 --> 25:55.137
- CHARLOTTE: Who's to inherit.
- Indeed. Everything, apparently.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.973
Even my piano stool belongs to Mr Collins.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.099
When?

25:59.183 --> 26:01.184
He may turn us out of the house
as soon as he pleases.

26:01.269 --> 26:02.519
But why?

26:02.603 --> 26:05.981
Because the estate passes directly
to him and not to us poor females.

26:11.279 --> 26:13.363
Mr Collins, at your service.

26:22.831 --> 26:26.917
What a superbly featured room
and what excellent boiled potatoes.

26:27.878 --> 26:31.297
Many years since I've had
such an exemplary vegetable.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.424
To which of my fair cousins

26:33.508 --> 26:35.968
should I compliment the excellence
of the cooking?

26:36.053 --> 26:39.221
Mr Collins, we are perfectly able
to keep a cook.

26:39.306 --> 26:40.639
COLLINS: Excellent.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.268
I'm very pleased
the estate can afford such a living.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.149
I am honoured to have as my patroness,

26:50.233 --> 26:51.901
Lady Catherine de Bourg.

26:51.985 --> 26:53.778
You've heard of her, I presume?

26:54.821 --> 26:58.865
My small rectory abuts her estate,

26:58.949 --> 27:01.868
Rosings Park, and she often condescends

27:01.952 --> 27:06.664
to drive by my humble dwelling
in her little phaeton and ponies.

27:07.750 --> 27:09.542
Does she have any family?

27:09.627 --> 27:13.546
One daughter, the heiress of Rosings
and very extensive property.

27:14.757 --> 27:16.674
I've often observed to Lady Catherine

27:16.759 --> 27:19.886
that her daughter seemed born to be a duchess,

27:19.970 --> 27:24.307
for she has all the superior graces
of elevated rank.

27:25.643 --> 27:27.727
These are the kind of
little delicate compliments

27:27.812 --> 27:29.437
which are always acceptable to the ladies

27:29.522 --> 27:34.149
and which I conceive myself
particularly bound to pay.

27:34.943 --> 27:36.944
BENNET: How happy for you, Mr Collins,

27:37.028 --> 27:40.656
to possess the talent for flattering
with such delicacy.

27:42.659 --> 27:44.868
Do these pleasing attentions proceed from

27:44.953 --> 27:46.412
the impulse of the moment

27:46.496 --> 27:48.872
or are they the result of previous study?

27:48.998 --> 27:51.250
COLLINS: They arise chiefly
from what is passing at the time,

27:51.334 --> 27:52.918
and though I do sometimes amuse myself

27:53.002 --> 27:55.546
with arranging such little elegant compliments,

27:56.214 --> 28:00.467
I always wish to give them
as unstudied an air as possible.

28:01.511 --> 28:04.221
Believe me, no one would suspect
your manners to be rehearsed.

After dinner I thought I might read
to you all for an hour or two.

28:14.940 --> 28:17.316
I have with me Fordyce's Sermons

28:17.818 --> 28:20.653
which speak very eloquently
on all matters moral.

with Fordyce's Sermons, Miss Bennet?

28:31.957 --> 28:34.667
Mrs Bennet, you do know that I've been bestowed

28:34.751 --> 28:36.919
by the good grace of Lady Catherine de Bourg

28:37.004 --> 28:39.338
a parsonage of no mean size.

28:39.465 --> 28:41.799
I have become aware of the fact.

28:41.884 --> 28:44.009
Well, it is my avowed hope that soon

28:44.093 --> 28:47.429
I may find a mistress for it
and I have to inform you

28:47.513 --> 28:52.350
that the eldest Miss Bennet
has captured my special attention.

28:53.895 --> 28:55.437
Oh, Mr Collins,

28:56.439 --> 29:00.692
unfortunately, it is incumbent upon me

29:00.776 --> 29:03.778
to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet

29:03.863 --> 29:06.907
is very soon to be engaged.

29:07.116 --> 29:08.408
Engaged?

29:08.701 --> 29:11.161
But Miss Lizzie, next to her
in both age and beauty,

29:11.245 --> 29:13.914
would make anyone an excellent partner.

29:14.916 --> 29:18.417
Do not you agree, Mr Collins?

29:19.169 --> 29:20.419
Indeed.

29:22.047 --> 29:23.088
Indeed.

29:24.090 --> 29:26.175
Very agreeable alternative.

Yours, I believe.

29:54.411 --> 29:56.955
Mr Wickham, how perfect you are.

29:57.039 --> 29:58.206
He picked up my handkerchief, too.

29:58.290 --> 29:59.624
Did you drop yours on purpose, Lizzie?

29:59.708 --> 30:03.002
- LYDIA: Mr Wickham's a lieutenant.
- An enchanted lieutenant.

30:03.087 --> 30:04.212
What are you up to, Liddy?

30:04.296 --> 30:06.047
LYDIA: We just happened to be looking
for some ribbon.

30:06.131 --> 30:07.549
White, for the ball.

30:07.633 --> 30:10.134
Shall we all look for some ribbon together?

LYDIA: Good afternoon, Mr James.
MILLINER: Good afternoon, Miss Lydia.

30:16.517 --> 30:18.518
- MILLINER: Miss Bennet.
- I shan't even browse.

30:18.686 --> 30:21.646
I can't be trusted.
I have very poor taste in ribbons.

30:21.730 --> 30:24.399
Only a man truly confident
of himself would admit to that.

30:24.483 --> 30:27.026
No, it's true. And buckles.

30:27.111 --> 30:29.361
When it comes to buckles, I'm lost.

30:29.445 --> 30:31.780
Dear, oh, dear. You must be
the shame of the regiment.

30:31.864 --> 30:34.575
- A laughingstock.
- What do your superiors do with you?

30:37.495 --> 30:38.829
Ignore me.

30:39.330 --> 30:42.332
I'm of next to no importance,
so it's easily done.

30:42.917 --> 30:44.710
LYDIA: Lizzie, lend me some money.

30:44.794 --> 30:46.712
You already owe me a fortune, Liddy.

30:46.963 --> 30:50.382
- Allow me to oblige.
- ELIZABETH: Oh, no, Mr Wickham, please.

30:55.847 --> 30:57.180
I insist.

- WICKHAM: So do I, miserable bunch.
- I don't know.

31:04.813 --> 31:07.481
- Look, Mr Bingley.
- Mr Bingley!

31:07.566 --> 31:09.233
I was just on my way to your house.

31:09.318 --> 31:12.153
Mr Bingley, how do you like
my ribbons for your ball?

31:13.447 --> 31:14.655
Very beautiful.

31:14.740 --> 31:16.907
She is. Look at her. She's blooming.

31:16.992 --> 31:18.200
Oh, Lydia.

31:18.660 --> 31:22.371
Be sure to invite Mr Wickham,
he is a credit to his profession.

31:22.456 --> 31:25.124
JANE: Lydia, you can't invite people
to other people's balls.

31:27.085 --> 31:29.378
Of course you must come, Mr Wickham.

31:29.504 --> 31:32.340
If you'll excuse me, ladies. Enjoy the day.

31:35.927 --> 31:38.303
ELIZABETH: Do you plan to go to the
Netherfield ball, then, Mr Wickham?

31:39.221 --> 31:40.388
Perhaps.

31:41.015 --> 31:43.725
How long has Mr Darcy been a guest there?

31:44.935 --> 31:46.311
About a month.

31:47.730 --> 31:50.315
Forgive me, but are you acquainted with him?

31:51.025 --> 31:52.567
With Mr Darcy?

31:52.735 --> 31:56.154
Indeed. I've been connected
with his family since infancy.

31:57.323 --> 31:59.908
You may well be surprised, Miss Elizabeth,

32:00.076 --> 32:03.078
especially given our cold greeting
this afternoon.

32:04.997 --> 32:07.666
Well, I hope that your plans
in favour of Meryton

32:07.750 --> 32:09.959
will not be affected by
your relations with the gentleman.

32:10.044 --> 32:12.544
Oh, no, it is not for me to be driven away.

32:12.754 --> 32:15.756
If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go,

32:16.257 --> 32:17.424
not I.

32:18.760 --> 32:20.135
I must ask, Mr Wickham,

32:20.220 --> 32:22.763
what is the manner
of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?

32:25.850 --> 32:28.102
My father managed his estate.

32:29.104 --> 32:31.522
We grew up together, Darcy and I.

32:32.607 --> 32:35.025
His father treated me like a second son.

32:35.110 --> 32:36.902
Loved me like a son.

32:38.697 --> 32:41.281
We were both with him the day he died.

32:43.201 --> 32:45.035
With his last breath,

32:45.704 --> 32:48.621
his father bequeathed me
the rectory in his estate.

32:48.914 --> 32:51.958
He knew I had my heart set
on joining the church.

32:52.292 --> 32:55.795
But Darcy ignored his wishes
and gave the living to another man.

32:55.921 --> 32:58.381
- But why?
- Jealousy.

33:00.759 --> 33:02.301
His father...

33:03.971 --> 33:06.472
Well, he loved me better
and Darcy couldn't stand it.

33:07.725 --> 33:10.476
- How cruel.
- So now, I'm a poor foot soldier,

33:10.602 --> 33:12.812
too lowly even to be noticed.

33:21.488 --> 33:23.238

33:24.824 --> 33:25.824
Oh!

33:25.908 --> 33:29.536

- I can't any more. You're hurting.

33:33.666 --> 33:34.750
LYDIA: Betsy.

33:35.877 --> 33:36.877
Betsy.

33:48.723 --> 33:50.766
I still think there must have been
a misunderstanding.

33:50.850 --> 33:52.809
Oh, Jane, do you never think ill of anybody?

33:52.894 --> 33:55.353
Well, how could Mr Darcy do such a thing?

33:56.897 --> 33:58.814
I'll discover the truth from Mr Bingley

33:58.899 --> 33:59.940
at the ball this evening.

34:00.025 --> 34:02.943
If it is not true,
let Mr Darcy contradict it himself.

34:03.111 --> 34:05.321
Till he does, I hope never to encounter him.

34:05.405 --> 34:07.656
Poor, unfortunate Mr Wickham.

34:08.033 --> 34:10.493
On the contrary,
Wickham is twice the man Darcy is.

34:10.577 --> 34:12.703
And let us hope, a rather more willing dancer.

34:19.377 --> 34:21.003
Oh, there they are. Look.

35:00.042 --> 35:02.418
May I say what an immense pleasure it is

35:02.503 --> 35:04.754
- to see you again, Mr Bingley.
- Mrs Bennet.

35:05.047 --> 35:07.047
- Miss Bingley.
- Charming.

35:09.926 --> 35:13.220
- I'm so pleased you're here.
- So am I.

35:14.430 --> 35:15.806
And how are you?

35:17.141 --> 35:19.601
Miss Elizabeth, are you looking for someone?

35:19.686 --> 35:21.812
No. No, not at all.

35:21.896 --> 35:24.022
I was just admiring the general splendour.

35:24.274 --> 35:26.525
It is breath-taking, Mr Bingley.

35:26.609 --> 35:27.734
Good.

35:36.160 --> 35:40.247
MRS BENNET: You might at least have
passed a few pleasantries with Mr Bingley.

35:40.790 --> 35:43.249
I dare say I've never met
a more pleasant gentleman

35:43.333 --> 35:44.709
in all my years.

35:44.793 --> 35:46.878
Did you see how he dotes on her?

35:47.379 --> 35:50.965
Dear Jane. Always doing
what's best for her family.

36:09.651 --> 36:11.402
- Charlotte.
- Lizzie.

36:11.695 --> 36:15.740
- Have you seen Mr Wickham?
- No, perhaps he is through here.

36:28.836 --> 36:31.129
Lizzie. Mr Wickham is not here.

36:31.547 --> 36:33.173
Apparently he's been detained.

36:33.466 --> 36:36.343
Detained where? He must be here.

36:36.761 --> 36:38.178
There you are.

36:38.596 --> 36:39.971
Mr Collins.

36:41.182 --> 36:44.059
Perhaps you will do me the honour,
Miss Elizabeth?

36:46.646 --> 36:49.022
I did not think you danced, Mr Collins.

36:49.106 --> 36:51.316
I do not think it incompatible
with the office of a clergyman

36:51.400 --> 36:53.776
to indulge in such an innocent diversion.

36:53.860 --> 36:56.737
In fact, several people, well,
Her Ladyship included,

36:56.821 --> 37:00.407
have complimented me on my lightness of foot.

JANE: Apparently, your Mr Wickham

37:27.142 --> 37:29.268
has been called on some business to town.

37:33.607 --> 37:35.650
To be sure, dancing is of
little consequence to me,

37:35.734 --> 37:37.402
but it does...

37:38.612 --> 37:40.822
It does harbour the opportunity to lavish...

37:45.744 --> 37:46.869
To lavish upon one's partner...

37:46.954 --> 37:47.954
And my informer tells me

that he would have been less inclined...

Were it not for the presence

37:57.881 --> 37:59.465
Which is my primary object of the evening.

37:59.550 --> 38:01.633
That gentleman barely warrants the name.

38:02.927 --> 38:05.971
It is my intention, if I may be so bold,

38:06.055 --> 38:08.765
to remain close to you throughout the evening.

38:25.742 --> 38:26.992
You may.

38:37.794 --> 38:39.503
Did I just agree to dance with Mr Darcy?

38:39.588 --> 38:41.797
I daresay you will find him
very amiable, Lizzie.

38:41.882 --> 38:43.340
It would be most inconvenient,

38:43.425 --> 38:45.593
since I have sworn
to loathe him for all eternity.

- Indeed. Most invigorating.

It is your turn to say something, Mr Darcy.

39:14.330 --> 39:16.372
I talked about the dance,
now you ought to remark

39:16.457 --> 39:19.209
on the size of the room
or the number of couples.

39:20.669 --> 39:22.045
I am perfectly happy to oblige.

39:22.129 --> 39:24.839
Please advise me
of what you would like most to hear.

39:24.924 --> 39:27.008
That reply will do for present.

39:30.513 --> 39:33.139
Perhaps by and by,
I may observe that private balls

39:33.224 --> 39:35.517
are much pleasanter than public ones.

39:38.479 --> 39:40.438
For now we may remain silent.

39:49.405 --> 39:51.990
Do you talk, as a rule, while dancing?

39:52.700 --> 39:53.700
No.

39:54.410 --> 39:56.995
No, I prefer to be unsociable and taciturn.

40:00.542 --> 40:03.669
Makes it all so much more enjoyable,
don't you think?

40:06.464 --> 40:10.134
Tell me, do you and your sisters
very often walk to Meryton?

40:13.096 --> 40:15.264
Yes, we often walk to Meryton.

40:16.599 --> 40:19.393
It's a great opportunity to meet new people.

40:21.187 --> 40:23.146
In fact, when you met us,
we'd just had the pleasure

40:23.230 --> 40:25.356
of forming a new acquaintance.

40:27.234 --> 40:29.652
Mr Wickham is blessed with such happy manners

40:29.736 --> 40:31.988
he is sure of making friends.

40:32.072 --> 40:34.115
Whether he's capable
of retaining them is less certain.

40:34.199 --> 40:37.535
He's been so unfortunate
as to lose your friendship.

40:38.662 --> 40:40.496
And I daresay that is an irreversible event?

40:40.581 --> 40:43.207
It is. Why do you ask
such a question?

40:43.292 --> 40:44.709
To make out your character, Mr Darcy.

40:44.793 --> 40:47.295
- And what have you discovered?
- Very little.

of you as puzzle me exceedingly.

Everyone, out.

Dear Miss Elizabeth,

47:28.685 --> 47:32.145
I am sure my attentions have been
too marked to be mistaken.

47:32.230 --> 47:34.731
Almost as soon as I entered the house,

47:34.816 --> 47:38.193
I singled you out as the companion
of my future life.

47:38.486 --> 47:39.653
(CLEARS THROAT)

47:40.154 --> 47:42.906
But before I am run away with my feelings,

47:42.991 --> 47:45.867
perhaps I may state my reasons for marrying.

47:46.160 --> 47:48.453
Firstly, that it is the duty of a clergyman

47:48.538 --> 47:51.331
to set the example of matrimony in his parish.

47:51.416 --> 47:55.377
Secondly, that I am convinced
it will add greatly to my happiness.

47:55.461 --> 47:58.921
And thirdly, that it is at the urging

47:59.006 --> 48:01.591
of my esteemed patroness, Lady Catherine,

48:02.175 --> 48:03.926
that I select a wife.

48:04.845 --> 48:08.389
My object in coming to Longbourn
was to choose such a one

48:08.473 --> 48:10.141
from among Mr Bennet's daughters,

48:10.225 --> 48:14.103
for I am to inherit the estate,

48:14.980 --> 48:17.273
and such an alliance will surely

48:18.025 --> 48:19.358
suit everyone.

48:22.029 --> 48:24.530
And now, nothing remains but for me

48:24.615 --> 48:26.991
to assure you in the most animated language,

48:27.075 --> 48:28.284
of the violence of my affections.

48:28.368 --> 48:29.493
Mr Collins.

48:29.578 --> 48:31.745
And that no reproach on the subject of fortune

48:31.829 --> 48:33.455
will cross my lips once we're married.

48:33.539 --> 48:36.166
You are too hasty, sir. You forget
that I have given no answer.

48:36.250 --> 48:39.336
I must add that Lady Catherine
will thoroughly approve

48:39.420 --> 48:43.048
when I speak to her of your modesty,
economy, and other

48:44.175 --> 48:45.550
amiable qualities.

48:45.635 --> 48:50.221
Sir, I am honoured by your proposal,
but I regret that I must decline it.

48:51.807 --> 48:55.393
I know ladies don't seek to seem too eager...

48:55.478 --> 48:58.021
Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious.

48:58.105 --> 48:59.898
You could not make me happy and I'm convinced

48:59.982 --> 49:03.234
I'm the last woman in the world
who could make you happy.

49:03.319 --> 49:05.153
I flatter myself, cousin, that your refusal

49:05.237 --> 49:07.363
is merely a natural delicacy.

49:08.073 --> 49:09.615
Besides, you should take into account

49:09.699 --> 49:11.325
that despite the manifold attractions,

49:11.409 --> 49:13.535
it is by no means certain
that another offer of marriage

49:13.620 --> 49:15.245
- may ever be made to you.
- Mr Collins.

49:15.330 --> 49:16.330
So I must conclude

49:16.414 --> 49:19.041
that you simply seek
to increase my love by suspense...

...according to the usual practise
of elegant females.

01:00:44.874 --> 01:00:46.750
A little, ma'am, and very poorly.

01:00:47.001 --> 01:00:48.168
(EXCLAIMING)

01:00:48.336 --> 01:00:49.753
Do you draw?

01:00:50.421 --> 01:00:51.921
No, not at all.

01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:54.632
Your sisters, do they draw?

01:00:55.134 --> 01:00:57.594
- Not one.
- That's very strange.

01:00:58.679 --> 01:01:00.930
I suppose you had no opportunity.

01:01:01.182 --> 01:01:03.350
Your mother should've taken you
to town every spring

01:01:03.434 --> 01:01:04.893
for the benefit of the masters.

01:01:04.977 --> 01:01:08.813
I'm sure my mother wouldn't have
minded, but my father hates town.

01:01:09.482 --> 01:01:12.942
- Has your governess left you?
- We never had a governess.

01:01:14.278 --> 01:01:15.779
No governess?

01:01:16.447 --> 01:01:18.615
Five daughters brought up at home
without a governess.

01:01:18.699 --> 01:01:20.657
I never heard such a thing.

01:01:20.742 --> 01:01:23.369
Your mother must have been
quite a slave to your education.

01:01:23.453 --> 01:01:25.079
Not at all, Lady Catherine.

01:01:30.043 --> 01:01:32.378
Your younger sisters, are they out in society?

01:01:32.462 --> 01:01:33.754
Yes, ma'am. All.

01:01:33.838 --> 01:01:36.215
All? What, all five out at once?

01:01:36.299 --> 01:01:39.259
Oh, that's very odd.
And you only the second.

01:01:39.636 --> 01:01:42.137
The younger ones out
before the elders are married.

01:01:42.222 --> 01:01:45.182
Your youngest sisters must be very young.

01:01:45.475 --> 01:01:47.643
Yes, my youngest is not 16.

01:01:48.478 --> 01:01:50.521
But I think it would be very hard
on younger sisters

01:01:50.605 --> 01:01:52.022
not to have their share of amusement

01:01:52.107 --> 01:01:54.149
because the elder is still unmarried.

01:01:54.234 --> 01:01:57.193
It would hardly encourage sisterly affection.

01:01:57.403 --> 01:01:58.444
Upon my word,

01:01:58.529 --> 01:02:01.489
you give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person.

01:02:02.658 --> 01:02:04.450
Pray, what is your age?

01:02:05.619 --> 01:02:07.036
With three younger sisters grown up,

01:02:07.121 --> 01:02:09.414
Your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own to it.

Come, Miss Bennet, and play for us.

01:02:22.719 --> 01:02:23.845
No, I beg you.

01:02:23.929 --> 01:02:25.972
For music is my delight.

01:02:26.432 --> 01:02:28.766
In fact there are few people in England

01:02:28.851 --> 01:02:32.185
who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself,

01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:34.521
or better natural taste.

01:02:35.523 --> 01:02:37.315
If I had ever learnt,

01:02:37.525 --> 01:02:40.193
I should have been a great proficient.

01:02:41.195 --> 01:02:42.863
So would Anne,

01:02:42.947 --> 01:02:45.365
if her health would have allowed her.

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:48.118
Lady Catherine, I'm not afflicted
with false modesty.

01:02:48.202 --> 01:02:49.661
When I say I play poorly...

01:02:49.745 --> 01:02:53.373
Come, come, Lizzie, Her Ladyship demands it.

01:03:02.592 --> 01:03:03.967

How does Georgiana get along, Darcy?

01:03:19.107 --> 01:03:21.984
- She plays very well.
- LADY CATHERINE: I hope she practices.

01:03:23.153 --> 01:03:26.113
No excellence can be acquired
without constant practise.

01:03:26.198 --> 01:03:28.365
I've told Mrs Collins this.

01:03:28.742 --> 01:03:30.409
Though you have no instrument of your own,

01:03:30.494 --> 01:03:32.286
you're very welcome to come to Rosings

01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:34.497

in the housekeeper's room.

01:03:34.581 --> 01:03:35.831
Oh, I thank you, Your Ladyship.

01:03:35.916 --> 01:03:39.209
You'll be in nobody's way
in that part of the house.

01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:48.343
You mean to frighten me, Mr Darcy,

01:03:48.427 --> 01:03:51.095
by coming in all your state to hear me,

01:03:51.972 --> 01:03:54.557
but I won't be alarmed even
if your sister does play so well.

01:03:54.642 --> 01:03:56.684
I'm well enough acquainted with you,
Miss Elizabeth,

01:03:56.769 --> 01:04:00.021
to know that I cannot alarm you
even should I wish it.

Prepare yourself for something very dreadful.

The first time I saw him at the assembly,

01:04:12.535 --> 01:04:14.243
he danced with nobody at all.

Even though gentlemen were scarce

01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:18.622
and there was more than one young
lady sitting down without a partner.

01:04:18.706 --> 01:04:20.374
I knew nobody beyond my own party.

01:04:20.458 --> 01:04:22.376
Oh, and nobody can be introduced in a ballroom.

LADY CATHERINE: Fitzwilliam, I need you.

01:04:35.807 --> 01:04:38.350

01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:42.354
of conversing easily with people
I have never met before.

01:04:42.522 --> 01:04:46.024

gone on business to the village.

This is a charming house.

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:52.881
I believe my aunt did a great deal to it

01:05:52.965 --> 01:05:55.050
when Mr Collins first arrived.

01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:57.802
I believe so.

She could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful subject.

Good day, Miss Elizabeth.
It's been a pleasure.

01:06:30.001 --> 01:06:33.087
What on earth have you done to poor Mr Darcy?

01:06:33.546 --> 01:06:34.921

There are many conveniences
which others can supply

01:06:46.475 --> 01:06:48.685
and which we cannot procure for ourselves.

01:06:48.769 --> 01:06:51.062
I have now principally in view those objects

01:06:51.146 --> 01:06:53.940
which are only to be obtained
through intercourse.

01:06:56.276 --> 01:06:57.276
Forgive me.

01:06:57.361 --> 01:07:00.238
Through the intercourse
of friendship or civility.

01:07:01.907 --> 01:07:04.575
On such occasions, the proud man steps forth

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:07.704
to meet you not with the cordiality
of affection,

01:07:07.788 --> 01:07:11.998
but with the suspicion of one
who reconnoitres an enemy...

01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:15.127
So, how long do you plan to stay
in Kent, Colonel?

01:07:15.211 --> 01:07:17.754
As long as Darcy chooses.
I'm at his disposal.

01:07:17.839 --> 01:07:19.840
Everyone appears to be at his disposal.

01:07:19.924 --> 01:07:23.552
I wonder he doesn't marry and secure
a lasting convenience of that kind.

01:07:23.636 --> 01:07:26.054
She would be a lucky woman.

01:07:26.639 --> 01:07:27.764
Really?

01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:30.517
Darcy is a most loyal companion.

01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:32.686
From what I heard on our journey here,

01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:35.397
he recently came to the rescue
of one of his friends just in time.

01:07:35.481 --> 01:07:36.648
What happened?

01:07:36.733 --> 01:07:38.567
He saved the man from an imprudent marriage.

01:07:38.651 --> 01:07:39.818
Who was the man?

01:07:45.532 --> 01:07:48.033
His closest friend, Charles Bingley.

01:07:51.496 --> 01:07:54.331
Did Mr Darcy give a reason
for this interference?

01:07:54.624 --> 01:07:57.668
There were apparently strong
objections to the lady.

01:07:58.128 --> 01:08:00.004
What kind of objections?

01:08:00.297 --> 01:08:01.505
Her lack of fortune?

01:08:01.590 --> 01:08:05.050
I think it was her family
that was considered unsuitable.

01:08:06.970 --> 01:08:08.637
So he separated them.

01:08:08.722 --> 01:08:11.015

I had to see you.

01:08:52.014 --> 01:08:54.765
I have fought against my better
judgment, my family's expectation,

01:08:54.849 --> 01:08:56.975
the inferiority of your birth,
my rank and circumstance,

01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:59.353
all these things, and I'm willing
to put them aside and ask you

01:08:59.437 --> 01:09:00.479
to end my agony.

01:09:00.563 --> 01:09:02.731

- I love you.

Most ardently.

01:09:11.115 --> 01:09:13.908

you have been through

Believe me, it was unconsciously done.

- Is this your reply?
- Yes, sir.

01:09:28.924 --> 01:09:31.259
Are you laughing at me?

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:32.885
- No.
- Are you rejecting me?

01:09:32.970 --> 01:09:34.929
I'm sure that the feelings which,
as you've told me,

01:09:35.013 --> 01:09:37.765
have hindered your regard
will help you in overcoming it.

01:09:38.850 --> 01:09:39.850
Might I ask why,

01:09:39.935 --> 01:09:42.103
with so little endeavour at civility,
I am thus repulsed?

01:09:42.187 --> 01:09:43.604
And I might as well enquire why,

01:09:43.689 --> 01:09:45.356
with so evident a design of insulting me,

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:46.649
you chose to tell me that you liked me

01:09:46.733 --> 01:09:48.192
- against your better judgement!
- No, believe me...

01:09:48.277 --> 01:09:50.069
If I was uncivil, then that is some excuse!

But I have other reasons.
You know I have.

01:09:51.822 --> 01:09:53.029
What reasons?

01:09:53.115 --> 01:09:55.533
Do you think that anything might
tempt me to accept the man

That you separated a young couple
who loved each other,

01:10:05.543 --> 01:10:07.836
exposing your friend to the centre
of the world for caprice

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:10.922
and my sister to its derision
for disappointed hopes.

01:10:11.007 --> 01:10:13.008
And involving them both in misery
of the acutest kind?

01:10:13.092 --> 01:10:14.759
I do not deny it.

01:10:15.595 --> 01:10:16.553
How could you do it?

01:10:16.637 --> 01:10:18.430
Because I believed your sister
indifferent to him.

01:10:18.514 --> 01:10:19.556
Indifferent?

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.724
I watched them most carefully

01:10:20.808 --> 01:10:22.309
and realise his attachment was deeper than hers.

01:10:22.393 --> 01:10:23.393
That's because she's shy.

Bingley, too, is modest

01:10:24.562 --> 01:10:26.104

she didn't feel strongly for him.

- Because you suggested it.
- I did it for his own good.

01:10:28.316 --> 01:10:31.359
My sister hardly shows her true feelings to me!

01:10:35.823 --> 01:10:39.074

that his fortune had some bearing...

01:10:39.159 --> 01:10:40.659
No! I wouldn't do your sister
the dishonour!

- Though it was suggested...
- What was?

It was made perfectly clear
that an advantageous marriage...

01:10:45.874 --> 01:10:48.751
- Did my sister give that impression?
- No! No!

01:10:48.835 --> 01:10:49.877
No. There was, however,

01:10:49.961 --> 01:10:51.086
I have to admit, the matter of your family.

- No, it was more than that.
- How, sir?

01:10:55.508 --> 01:10:56.508

He told me of his misfortunes.

01:11:24.370 --> 01:11:26.621
Oh, yes, his misfortunes
have been very great indeed.

01:11:26.705 --> 01:11:30.041
You ruin his chances,
and yet you treat him with sarcasm?

01:11:30.125 --> 01:11:32.168
So this is your opinion of me.

01:11:32.753 --> 01:11:34.087

been overlooked had not your

about our relationship.

Could you expect me to rejoice

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:43.888
in the inferiority of your circumstances?

01:11:43.973 --> 01:11:46.599
And those are the words of a gentleman.

01:11:46.684 --> 01:11:47.976
From the first moment I met you,

01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:50.310
your arrogance and conceit, your selfish disdain

01:11:50.395 --> 01:11:51.478
for the feelings of others

01:11:51.562 --> 01:11:53.730
made me realise that you were
the last man in the world

01:11:53.815 --> 01:11:56.400
I could ever be prevailed upon to marry.

01:12:08.788 --> 01:12:12.499

so much of your time.

DARCY: I shall not renew the sentiments
which were so disgusting to you,

but if I may, I will address the two
of fences you have laid against me.

01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:47.899
My father loved Mr Wickham as a son.

01:14:48.568 --> 01:14:51.153
In consequence he left him a generous living.

01:14:51.571 --> 01:14:53.196
But upon my father's death, Mr Wickham

01:14:53.281 --> 01:14:56.408
announced he had no intention of taking orders.

01:14:57.243 --> 01:14:59.953
He demanded the value of the living
which he was given

01:15:00.037 --> 01:15:02.664
and which he gambled away within weeks.

01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:08.670
He then wrote demanding more money,
which I refused,

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:11.423
after which he severed all acquaintance.

01:15:12.049 --> 01:15:14.134
He came back to see us last summer,

01:15:14.218 --> 01:15:16.803
at which point he declared
passionate love for my sister

01:15:16.888 --> 01:15:19.722
whom he tried to persuade to elope with him.

01:15:20.807 --> 01:15:23.184
She is to inherit £30,000.

01:15:24.227 --> 01:15:25.519
When it was made clear

01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:27.563
he would never receive a penny
of that inheritance,

01:15:27.647 --> 01:15:29.273
he disappeared.

01:15:30.150 --> 01:15:33.944
I will not attempt to convey
the depth of Georgiana's despair.

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:35.821

may to you appear insufficient,

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:49.084

- She's in the drawing room.

I'd hardly notice.

Oh, Kitty, stop making such a fuss.

01:16:56.818 --> 01:16:59.820
- Why didn't she ask me as well?
- MRS BENNET: She probably can't afford it.

- Because I'm better company.
- Kitty, what's the matter?

- MRS BENNET: If I could but go to Brighton.

- Also because I am two years older.
- Let's all go.

01:17:06.368 --> 01:17:08.703
Lydia's been invited to go
to Brighton with the Forsters.

01:17:08.787 --> 01:17:11.289
A little sea-bathing would set me up
very nicely.

01:17:20.966 --> 01:17:23.801

with so little inconvenience

01:17:23.885 --> 01:17:25.469
as under the present circumstances.

01:17:25.554 --> 01:17:27.888
If you, dear father, do not take
the trouble to check her,

to be an object of prey to anyone.

- Father, it's dangerous.
- I am certain

better worth their while.

Let us hope, in fact, that her stay in Brighton

01:18:04.675 --> 01:18:08.094
will teach her her own insignificance.

01:55:04.162 --> 01:55:08.832
I would have to tell you, you have
bewitched me, body and soul,

01:55:08.917 --> 01:55:12.753
and I love... I love... I love you.

01:55:13.213 --> 01:55:16.089
I never wish to be parted from you
from this day on.

01:55:27.685 --> 01:55:29.019
Well, then.

01:55:34.149 --> 01:55:35.900
Your hands are cold.

01:55:39.196 --> 01:55:40.738
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

01:56:21.195 --> 01:56:23.321
BENNET: Shut the door, please, Elizabeth.

01:56:34.333 --> 01:56:36.668
Lizzie, are you out of your senses?

01:56:37.587 --> 01:56:39.670
I thought you hated the man.

01:56:39.963 --> 01:56:41.171
No, Papa.

01:56:42.173 --> 01:56:44.758
He's rich, to be sure,

01:56:44.843 --> 01:56:47.928
and you will have more fine carriages than Jane.

01:56:48.888 --> 01:56:50.848
But will that make you happy?

01:56:51.891 --> 01:56:55.561
Have you no other objection
than your belief in my indifference?

01:56:56.146 --> 01:56:57.521
None at all.

01:56:58.398 --> 01:57:02.359
Well, we all know him to be a proud,
unpleasant sort of fellow,

01:57:03.903 --> 01:57:05.946
but this would be nothing
if you really liked him.

01:57:06.031 --> 01:57:07.781
- I do like him.
- Well.

01:57:10.035 --> 01:57:11.368
I love him.

01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:19.834
He's not proud. I was wrong,
I was entirely wrong about him.

01:57:23.047 --> 01:57:24.130
You don't know him, Papa.

01:57:24.214 --> 01:57:27.759
If I told you what he was
really like, what he's done.

01:57:28.802 --> 01:57:30.386
What has he done?

01:57:31.388 --> 01:57:32.722
(HENS CLUCKING)

01:57:33.057 --> 01:57:34.891
KITTY: Mary, look at him.

01:57:38.562 --> 01:57:39.520
But he's so...

01:57:39.605 --> 01:57:42.982
But she doesn't like him.
I thought she didn't like him.

01:57:43.067 --> 01:57:45.068
So did I. So did we all.

01:57:46.570 --> 01:57:48.529
We must have been wrong.

01:57:49.489 --> 01:57:51.239
Wouldn't be the first time, will it?

01:57:51.324 --> 01:57:52.324
(LAUGHING) No.

01:57:52.784 --> 01:57:54.785
Nor the last, I dare say.

01:58:00.583 --> 01:58:01.917
Good Lord.

01:58:04.921 --> 01:58:07.589
- I must pay him back.
- No.

01:58:08.925 --> 01:58:11.885
You mustn't tell anyone.
He wouldn't want it.

01:58:13.471 --> 01:58:16.014
We misjudged him, Papa, me more than anyone,

01:58:16.599 --> 01:58:19.267
in every way, not just in this matter.

01:58:20.853 --> 01:58:22.729
I've been nonsensical.

01:58:23.773 --> 01:58:27.108
But he's been a fool about Jane,

01:58:27.401 --> 01:58:29.527
about so many other things.

01:58:31.279 --> 01:58:32.488
But then, so have I.

01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:38.202
You see, he and I are...

01:58:40.455 --> 01:58:42.415
He and I are so similar.

01:58:43.959 --> 01:58:45.876
(LAUGHING) We're both so stubborn.

01:58:48.839 --> 01:58:50.131
Papa, I...

01:58:50.340 --> 01:58:51.507
(BENNET LAUGHING)

01:58:54.344 --> 01:58:56.637
You really do love him, don't you?

01:58:58.140 --> 01:58:59.431
Very much.

01:59:02.852 --> 01:59:03.852
(SIGHING)

01:59:04.854 --> 01:59:09.107
I cannot believe that anyone can deserve you,

01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:13.695
but it seems I am overruled.

01:59:15.489 --> 01:59:19.325
So I heartily give my consent.

01:59:28.252 --> 01:59:30.837
I could not have parted with you, my Lizzie,

01:59:31.464 --> 01:59:33.006
to anyone less worthy.

01:59:36.176 --> 01:59:38.010
Thank you.

01:59:47.771 --> 01:59:48.771
(CHUCKLING)

01:59:51.608 --> 01:59:53.650
If any young men come for Mary or Kitty,

01:59:53.735 --> 01:59:57.946
for heaven's sake, send them in,
I'm quite at my leisure.

02:00:21.013 --> 02:00:22.848
How are you this
evening, my dear?

02:00:22.931 --> 02:00:24.224
Very well.

02:00:24.308 --> 02:00:25.851
Only I wish you would not
call me "my dear".

02:00:25.934 --> 02:00:26.894
Why?

02:00:26.977 --> 02:00:28.979
'Cause it's what my father
always calls my mother

02:00:29.062 --> 02:00:30.397
when he's cross
about something.

02:00:30.481 --> 02:00:31.857
What endearments
am I allowed?

02:00:31.940 --> 02:00:33.400
Well, let me think.

02:00:33.650 --> 02:00:35.277
Lizzie, for everyday.

02:00:35.986 --> 02:00:38.489
My pearl, for Sundays.

02:00:39.323 --> 02:00:42.493
And Goddess Divine, but only
on very special occasions.

02:00:43.952 --> 02:00:46.997
And what shall I call you
when I'm cross?

02:00:48.332 --> 02:00:49.666
Mrs. Darcy?

02:00:49.750 --> 02:00:51.960
No. No.

02:00:53.003 --> 02:00:55.130
You may only call me
Mrs. Darcy

02:00:56.173 --> 02:00:58.175
when you are completely

02:00:58.342 --> 02:01:01.428
and perfectly,
and incandescently happy.

02:01:05.015 --> 02:01:08.811
And how are you this
evening, Mrs. Darcy?

02:01:18.195 --> 02:01:34.711
Mrs. Darcy.
