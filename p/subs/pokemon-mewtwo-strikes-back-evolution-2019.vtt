WEBVTT

00:19.602 --> 00:20.645
[chitters]

00:22.605 --> 00:25.191
[researcher 1]
The Mythical Pokémon... Mew.

00:25.692 --> 00:29.863
[researcher 2] They say it’s extinct,
but there have been reports of sightings.

00:32.907 --> 00:35.577
-Those reports haven’t been confirmed.
-Yes, sir.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.912
There hasn’t even been
a decent photo taken of it.

00:37.996 --> 00:39.622
[researcher 2] Unfortunately true.

00:46.671 --> 00:47.839
[excavator 1] It’s Mew.

00:48.423 --> 00:51.843
Having phenomenal powers
that can cause massive flooding,

00:51.926 --> 00:54.012
or plant life to bloom in the wild,

00:54.095 --> 00:56.681
bestowing some of these powers
on humankind.

00:56.765 --> 00:58.767
[researcher 1] Is it good or evil?

00:58.850 --> 01:00.769
[researcher 2] Is it doing this on a whim?

01:00.852 --> 01:06.274
No matter what, one thing is for certain.
It wields great power.

01:06.941 --> 01:07.984
[all gasp]

01:13.156 --> 01:15.784
[excavator 1]
This is the fossil we just excavated.

01:16.785 --> 01:19.746
-It’s from the body of Mew!
-[excavator 1] That’s our theory.

01:20.705 --> 01:23.625
Let’s get this
back to the lab immediately!

01:23.708 --> 01:25.668
If it truly is a Mew fossil...

01:25.752 --> 01:29.589
[Dr. Fuji] Then we may be able to recreate
the most powerful of all Pokémon!

01:49.859 --> 01:51.110
[Mewtwo] Where am I?

01:52.904 --> 01:54.405
Who... am I?

01:59.410 --> 02:00.495
Who are you?

02:10.003 --> 02:12.382
I cannot forget the world...

02:13.174 --> 02:16.928
where a certain someone flew away from me.

02:33.611 --> 02:35.738
Who... am I?

02:37.991 --> 02:40.201
Why am I here?

02:41.703 --> 02:43.371
No.

02:43.454 --> 02:45.373
I am simply here.

02:46.541 --> 02:47.542
That is all.

02:48.793 --> 02:52.505
I haven’t emerged into this world.

03:01.723 --> 03:05.059
[groaning]

03:12.191 --> 03:13.568
[researchers gasp]

03:13.651 --> 03:15.612
-Huh?
-[all gasp]

03:15.695 --> 03:18.823
-[researcher 1 pants]
-[researcher 2 gasps]

03:19.407 --> 03:21.618
[researcher 1] It’s finally awakened!

03:21.701 --> 03:23.161
Mewtwo!

03:23.244 --> 03:24.329
Mewtwo?

03:24.412 --> 03:25.663
Hm.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.124
-Telepathy.
-Ah.

03:28.207 --> 03:32.712
Mewtwo. That is your name.
We have given life to you,

03:32.795 --> 03:35.632
using the rarest of Pokémon as a basis.

03:36.591 --> 03:41.221
Yes. That is the rarest
of the world’s Pokémon, Mew.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.056
Mew...

03:43.139 --> 03:45.516
Would that be my parent?

03:45.600 --> 03:47.977
My father? My mother?

03:48.478 --> 03:52.732
-Maybe either or maybe neither.
-Huh.

03:52.815 --> 03:57.904
[Dr. Fuji] Your existence is based on Mew,
but you were created to be even stronger.

03:57.987 --> 04:01.616
[Mewtwo] Who created me?
Neither father nor mother?

04:02.450 --> 04:04.160
Then nature?

04:04.702 --> 04:07.372
Then, are you saying
that I was created by nature?

04:07.455 --> 04:10.375
In this world,
only two things can create life,

04:10.458 --> 04:12.502
nature and human science.

04:12.585 --> 04:16.505
You did? You humans made me?

04:16.589 --> 04:20.009
-[lab tech 1] It’s a triumph of science!
-[lab tech 2] Proof we were right!

04:20.093 --> 04:23.346
[lab tech 3] We can continue our research!

04:23.429 --> 04:25.765
[lab tech 3] We should start
an even better version!

04:25.848 --> 04:27.642
[indistinct chattering]

04:28.226 --> 04:29.185
Who am I?

04:32.981 --> 04:34.065
Where am I?

04:35.108 --> 04:38.278
[Dr. Fuji] Congratulations.
I can't believe this.

04:40.363 --> 04:43.866
-[researcher 1] I can't believe we did it.
-[lab tech 1] Congratulations.

04:43.950 --> 04:47.328
[growls]

04:47.412 --> 04:49.622
[all scream and grunt]

04:49.706 --> 04:53.293
For what purpose was I created?

04:54.669 --> 04:55.545
[grunts] Huh?

04:55.878 --> 04:57.630
[groans]

05:03.094 --> 05:06.681
[groans and growls]

05:07.974 --> 05:11.019
[Dr. Fuji] Everyone,
we need to leave immediately!

05:11.102 --> 05:12.729
[lab tech 2] Go, go, go!

05:28.119 --> 05:29.704
[Mewtwo grunts]

05:35.001 --> 05:37.086
[screaming and shouting]

05:37.170 --> 05:39.547
[panting]

05:39.630 --> 05:42.592
Creating the most powerful Pokémon
in the world,

05:42.675 --> 05:44.886
it was our goal and ultimate dream!

06:29.472 --> 06:31.265
[Mewtwo] Is this my power?

06:31.349 --> 06:35.144
Am I the most powerful Pokémon
in the world?

06:36.646 --> 06:39.649
Mew... am I stronger than you?

06:44.862 --> 06:45.988
Hm?

06:46.072 --> 06:49.659
It’s true that you may be
the world’s most powerful Pokémon.

06:50.493 --> 06:54.163
But the world has
one other powerful life-form.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.500
Humans.

06:59.627 --> 07:04.132
If you were to join forces with humans,
the world would belong to us.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.426
The world would belong to us.

07:08.052 --> 07:11.514
However, if you were
to simply let your powers loose,

07:11.597 --> 07:14.725
the world’s destruction
would be the only outcome.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.228
Your powers must be controlled.

07:17.311 --> 07:20.481
-Controlled?
-Will you let them run wild

07:20.565 --> 07:23.985
and do to the world
the same thing you did to this island?

07:25.278 --> 07:26.487
What must I do?

07:43.504 --> 07:48.801
You place armor on me that protects me,
yet holds back my power.

07:48.885 --> 07:52.472
After all of this,
what do you expect of me?

07:52.555 --> 07:57.602
[Giovanni] It’s simple. You only need
to do what everyone in this world does.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.313
And what is that?

08:01.063 --> 08:03.816
Destruction, war and conquest.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.947
The strong will stand victorious.

08:23.252 --> 08:24.795
[grunts]

08:26.214 --> 08:28.049
[mooing]

08:28.132 --> 08:29.175
[grunts]

08:54.158 --> 08:55.910
[Mewtwo] Where am I?

08:59.789 --> 09:01.332
Who am I?

09:05.628 --> 09:11.259
[roaring]

09:15.429 --> 09:17.640
[groaning]

09:18.474 --> 09:20.560
Ah! [grunts]

09:23.020 --> 09:25.398
[growls]

09:30.069 --> 09:31.195
[both roar]

09:32.113 --> 09:32.947
[grunts]

09:41.789 --> 09:43.833
For what reason do I fight?

09:50.298 --> 09:52.258
For what reason do I live?

09:56.387 --> 09:57.221
Hmm?

09:58.514 --> 10:00.516
You are a Pokémon.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.269
Pokémon are used for human purposes.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.187
They live for humans’ sake.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.441
Are you telling me to fight for you?

10:09.191 --> 10:10.776
Is that what you mean?

10:10.860 --> 10:13.195
Are you saying I must fight for humans?

10:13.279 --> 10:16.532
You are a Pokémon
that was created by humans.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.951
What other value could you have?

10:19.410 --> 10:20.578
[Mewtwo] Value?

10:21.704 --> 10:23.956
Who am I?

10:24.040 --> 10:26.542
For what reason do I live?

10:27.627 --> 10:29.754
[grunts]

10:29.837 --> 10:31.047
What is this?

10:31.839 --> 10:33.633
You dare to defy humans?

10:41.599 --> 10:44.101
I was created by humans.

10:45.936 --> 10:48.814
But I am not human!

10:48.898 --> 10:53.736
And as an artificial Pokémon,
I am not a Pokémon either!

11:02.787 --> 11:03.871
[grunts]

11:43.119 --> 11:45.496
Who am I?

11:45.579 --> 11:49.542
Where am I? Who wanted me to be created?

11:51.293 --> 11:54.713
Who asked for me to be created?

11:54.797 --> 11:58.384
I despise
everything connected with my creation!

11:58.884 --> 11:59.885
And so...

12:00.928 --> 12:04.849
this is neither attack,
nor declaration of war.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.643
You are the ones who created me.

12:08.144 --> 12:13.023
And I will strike back... against you!

12:59.528 --> 13:01.405
Pika-Pika!

13:03.657 --> 13:05.201
[panting]

13:05.868 --> 13:09.121
[narrator] This young man
is Ash from Pallet Town.

13:09.205 --> 13:12.124
He’s traveling with friends
on a training journey,

13:12.208 --> 13:15.377
aiming to become a Pokémon Master.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.590
[Pikachu] Pika!

13:23.552 --> 13:25.095
[all] Wow.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.014
-I can smell the sea!
-[squeals]

13:27.097 --> 13:28.432
The view is great here.

13:28.516 --> 13:31.685
-Why don’t we have lunch?
-All right! [giggles]

13:32.186 --> 13:34.313
-Man, am I starving.
-Pikachu.

13:34.396 --> 13:37.441
Even after extra helpings
at the Pokémon Center this morning?

13:37.525 --> 13:40.694
-That was breakfast! This is lunch!
-Pika-Pika.

13:40.778 --> 13:43.322
You can’t battle
on an empty stomach, right?

13:43.405 --> 13:46.951
-Eating is part of training.
-Oh yeah! You said it!

13:47.034 --> 13:49.245
-That’s our Brock!
-Pikachu.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.455
Just be sure to help
with setting the table.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.457
-Sure! I’m all over it!
-Pika-Pika!

13:54.416 --> 13:57.169
[Pikachu] Pika-Pika, Pika!

13:57.253 --> 13:59.922
-Pikachu. Pika-Pika.
-[Togepi gibbers]

14:00.005 --> 14:01.257
Pika!

14:01.340 --> 14:04.343
Aw, I’m out of gas!

14:04.426 --> 14:06.637
But, Ash, you know we’re not done!

14:07.179 --> 14:10.099
I’m so hungry,
I can’t move another muscle.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.977
-Oh, come on!
-Misty?

14:13.060 --> 14:16.522
You have to let it simmer slowly
until it’s just right.

14:16.605 --> 14:19.692
You can’t rush stew,
or Pokémon, for that matter. Hm.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.026
Oh!

14:21.735 --> 14:22.611
[laughs]

14:23.320 --> 14:26.282
-Pika-Pika. Pikapi.
-[Togepi gibbers excitedly]

14:26.365 --> 14:28.784
-Pika.
-[Togepi gibbering]

14:28.868 --> 14:29.785
Pika-Pika.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.121
Pika?

14:36.834 --> 14:37.751
Pika?

14:41.046 --> 14:42.172
Pi! Pika!

14:44.967 --> 14:46.218
-Pika!
-[all] Huh?

14:46.302 --> 14:50.806
[pirate] Hey! You, little boy!
Are you Ash from Pallet Town?

14:51.932 --> 14:54.184
Huh? Yeah, that’s right.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.936
[laughs]

14:56.020 --> 14:59.440
Okay! Does that mean we can have
a Pokémon battle?

14:59.523 --> 15:02.902
Okay!
If somebody wants to battle, why not?

15:02.985 --> 15:05.404
What happened to the guy
who couldn’t move a muscle?

15:05.487 --> 15:07.615
I can have a Pokémon battle
before breakfast.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.575
-Maybe two!
-Pika-Pika.

15:09.658 --> 15:13.287
You’re forgetting one thing.
You’re battling before lunch.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.774

17:46.857 --> 17:50.569
-Who didn’t know you can’t rush a Pokémon.
-[Togepi gibbers]

17:54.156 --> 17:57.117
Pikachu is getting ever more skilled
by the minute!

17:57.201 --> 17:58.077
Oh! Gorgeous!

17:58.160 --> 18:00.537
We’ve got to get our paws
on that Pikachu

18:00.621 --> 18:03.248
and grab it for Team Rocket,
no matter what!

18:03.332 --> 18:04.666
[both] Hm!

18:04.750 --> 18:08.378
[James] Mm. But there’s more.
Just look at that spread!

18:08.462 --> 18:10.380
Here, Togepi, say ah!

18:10.464 --> 18:11.882
-Togepi!
-Taste good?

18:11.965 --> 18:16.095
-Am I hungry...
-I’ve got a frying pan.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.721
But without something to fry,

18:17.805 --> 18:20.474
it’s little more than a round anvil
made out of iron!

18:20.557 --> 18:22.184
[stomachs growling]

18:23.644 --> 18:24.645
[all sigh]

18:29.525 --> 18:31.068
[squawks]

18:40.035 --> 18:42.412
[Nurse Joy] That’s Ash from Pallet Town.

18:44.915 --> 18:48.669

20:17.090 --> 20:20.677
The location?
Pokémon Palace, on New Island.

20:20.761 --> 20:23.639
We ask that you RSVP,
whether attending or not,

20:23.722 --> 20:26.058

20:26.141 --> 20:29.019

-What do you think?

20:36.526 --> 20:40.447
-I think we should go! I know we should!
-She called us up and coming.

20:40.530 --> 20:43.200
-I don’t think that sounds bad at all!
-Pika.

20:44.868 --> 20:47.162
So, you’re going to mark the RSVP yes?

Please, quiet, everyone!
We have the harbor manager right here.

23:32.702 --> 23:37.582
I’m Miranda. If you want to hear the will
of the sea, listen to the harbor Wingull.

23:38.083 --> 23:41.128
But there’s no need.
Listen to these winds.

23:41.586 --> 23:43.797
I've never seen a hurricane like this
in my life.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.049
Is it really that bad?

23:46.133 --> 23:50.428
I grew up near this harbor and I’ve never
experienced a storm like this.

23:51.263 --> 23:55.767
And not only that, the storm is directly
over New Island, far out to sea.

23:55.851 --> 23:59.187
I cannot in good conscience allow you
to wander into such obvious danger.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.274
I beg you, as one sworn
to protect the harbor.

24:02.357 --> 24:05.402
You heard her.
The ferry for today is canceled.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.946
Well, I'm going to New Island anyway!

24:08.029 --> 24:09.823
My Pokémon are great swimmers!

-We’ll make it to that palace, no problem!
-No!

24:17.038 --> 24:18.832
If one of your Pokémon is wounded,

24:18.915 --> 24:21.585
the Pokémon Center here
won’t be able to help it!

24:21.668 --> 24:23.378
-[all gasp]
-What does that mean?

24:23.461 --> 24:27.549
Nurse Joy from the Pokémon Center,
she disappeared a week ago.

24:28.091 --> 24:31.553
And with Nurse Joy missing,
your Pokémon won’t be treated.

24:32.053 --> 24:34.431

39:08.804 --> 39:11.182
-Mewtwo?
-Pika.

39:11.265 --> 39:15.061
A Pokémon can't be a Pokémon Trainer!
No way!

39:15.144 --> 39:17.688
-[both] Are you sure?
-What’s that voice?

39:18.230 --> 39:19.982
-It’s telepathy.
-[all gasp]

39:20.775 --> 39:23.235
[both] I am the one
who chooses my own rules.

39:23.319 --> 39:25.946
If this is a bad joke, I’m going home!

39:31.035 --> 39:32.453
[grunting]

39:36.499 --> 39:38.167
[all gasp]

39:38.250 --> 39:42.671
[Fergus grunts and gasps]

39:42.755 --> 39:44.924
[screams]

39:50.262 --> 39:53.140
[groans] Get it, Gyarados!

39:57.436 --> 39:59.313
[roars]

39:59.397 --> 40:02.191
[gasps] Gyarados, use Hyper Beam!

40:13.702 --> 40:18.207
[Fergus grunts]

40:18.290 --> 40:19.417
Gyarados!

40:21.293 --> 40:22.711
[both] That was trivial.

40:23.504 --> 40:26.340
-[gasps]
-[Mewtwo] I have no more use for you.

40:26.966 --> 40:28.259
[whimpers and groans]

40:28.884 --> 40:30.136
[sighs]

40:30.219 --> 40:33.013
[pants]

40:37.476 --> 40:38.561
[breathes heavily]

40:39.562 --> 40:41.814
[gasps]

40:42.565 --> 40:45.693
-I knew it. Nurse Joy!
-Where am I?

40:46.861 --> 40:48.195
What am I doing here?

40:48.821 --> 40:52.950
[Mew-two] I brought you here
from the Pokémon Center to look after me.

40:53.033 --> 40:55.494
It is convenient
to have an expert well versed

40:55.578 --> 40:57.872
in the physiology of a Pokémon’s body.

40:58.372 --> 40:59.707
You were quite useful.

41:00.541 --> 41:04.086
-I suppose you remember nothing, correct?
-What did you say?

41:04.670 --> 41:09.592
With my power, it is easy to control
something as simple as the human brain.

41:10.176 --> 41:13.596
-That’s just awful!
-Pika-Pika!

41:35.534 --> 41:37.328
[all gasp]

41:47.129 --> 41:49.256
[Jessie] What kind of a place is this?

41:49.757 --> 41:52.134
[James] It doesn’t look like
a treasure vault.

42:01.435 --> 42:05.481
-How cute can you get?
-You think that’s cute?

42:08.651 --> 42:09.860
[sighs]

42:12.071 --> 42:13.447
[gasps]

42:13.531 --> 42:17.451
[bleeping]

42:21.288 --> 42:25.876
[Dr. Fuji] Our research has produced
a device that can make clones of Pokémon.

42:26.919 --> 42:30.172
With this, we found great success.

42:33.384 --> 42:37.221
-What’s going on? [yelps]
-[Jessie] Meowth! Meowth!

42:38.597 --> 42:40.391
Wait! Stop that thing!

42:40.474 --> 42:43.936
[grunting and groaning]

42:44.019 --> 42:46.522
[squealing and grunting]

42:47.273 --> 42:50.150
[Meowth squeals and grunts]

42:50.234 --> 42:53.237
[all scream]

42:54.029 --> 42:57.449
[whimpers]
Look what you did to my precious fur!

43:00.452 --> 43:01.704
[Jessie] Three hairs.

43:02.705 --> 43:04.331
[Dr. Fuji] It needn’t be much.

43:04.415 --> 43:08.961
If we can study a Pokémon’s tissue,
we can make a clone of that Pokémon.

43:09.545 --> 43:12.214
-[James] Who’s that Pokémon?
-[Jessie] It's Meowth!

43:17.553 --> 43:19.096
Whoa!

43:19.179 --> 43:22.349
-[Jessie and James] Meowth?
-[Meowth] But I’m Meowth.

43:22.433 --> 43:23.851
[Jessie] Then this is...

43:23.934 --> 43:26.979
-[James] A Meowth clone?
-[Meowth] Please!

43:29.523 --> 43:33.527
[Dr. Fuji] However, one clone I made
was different from the rest.

43:33.611 --> 43:37.573
From the Mythical Pokémon Mew,
found deep in the jungle,

43:38.115 --> 43:40.492
we discovered the tiniest of fossils.

43:40.909 --> 43:44.705
And from that,
I was able to bring forth Mewtwo,

43:44.788 --> 43:47.958
creating the most powerful Pokémon
in the world.

43:48.917 --> 43:50.127
That was our dream.

43:52.463 --> 43:53.464
However...

43:55.716 --> 43:56.967
[Jessie] Then this...

43:57.051 --> 44:00.220
[James] Is a lab
for creating Pokémon clones?

44:00.304 --> 44:03.932
[Meowth]
Wait, why isn’t there anybody here?

44:04.016 --> 44:06.352
Maybe it’s their day off.

44:06.435 --> 44:08.729
If that’s true, they must need it.

44:13.025 --> 44:13.859
Man...

44:14.568 --> 44:17.988
[Mewtwo] At one point,
I thought I’d work alongside humans.

44:18.072 --> 44:19.490
But I was disappointed.

44:20.658 --> 44:24.828
Humans are a dangerous species,
inferior even to Pokémon.

44:25.954 --> 44:29.917
If cruel, weak humans
are allowed to govern the planet,

44:30.417 --> 44:32.461
the world is headed for ruin.

44:32.544 --> 44:35.881
Who will rule the world?
I suppose a Pokémon like you?

44:35.964 --> 44:38.133
Pokémon are unfit as well.

44:38.217 --> 44:41.970
After all, they allowed humans to rule
in the first place.

44:42.513 --> 44:47.184
For some Pokémon, the purpose
of their lives is to serve humans.

44:47.267 --> 44:49.561
Pikachu! Pikachu!

44:50.270 --> 44:53.565
What’s this?
You say you do not serve this human?

44:53.941 --> 44:56.944
That you are with him
because you like this Trainer?

44:57.027 --> 44:58.153
Pika!

44:58.237 --> 45:00.489
You are as pathetic as the rest.

45:01.782 --> 45:03.742
Pika...

45:03.826 --> 45:06.453
-[Pikachu shrieks]
-[Ash grunts and yells]

45:07.830 --> 45:09.998
[both grunt]

45:10.958 --> 45:13.043
-[Ash exhales]
-Pikachu...

45:13.669 --> 45:15.295
-Pikachu?
-Pikachu!

45:15.379 --> 45:18.298
Weak Pokémon nestle under a human’s wing.

45:19.633 --> 45:23.429
-[Misty] Ash! Are you all right?
-Yeah.

45:23.512 --> 45:25.514
How dare you do that to Pikachu!

45:25.597 --> 45:27.057
No matter the Pokémon,

45:27.141 --> 45:30.144
there shouldn’t be any Pokémon
that can’t be caught!

45:30.227 --> 45:35.399
-Go! Rhyhorn, I choose you!
-[Rhyhorn grunts]

45:41.447 --> 45:42.531
[gasps]

45:45.659 --> 45:48.704
[banging and clanking]

45:49.371 --> 45:51.790
[groans]

45:53.834 --> 45:56.086
-[Corey] Rhyhorn!
-Wigglytuff.

45:56.503 --> 45:58.005
A waste of time.

45:58.088 --> 46:02.593
Since my creation, I’ve been far stronger
than any Pokémon alive!

46:02.676 --> 46:05.512
You sure? You never know until you try!

46:05.596 --> 46:07.306
[Pikachu] Pika.

46:07.389 --> 46:08.724
[Mewtwo chuckles]

46:10.100 --> 46:12.561
You want to try?

46:14.897 --> 46:17.316
[all gasp]

46:26.325 --> 46:29.995
-[all gasping]
-[Meowth] I’m not liking this at all.

46:35.626 --> 46:36.835
[all gasp]

46:38.712 --> 46:41.507
[all gasping and coughing]

46:44.009 --> 46:46.428
Blastoise Clone.

46:52.017 --> 46:52.976
[grunts]

46:58.357 --> 47:00.067
Venu.

47:05.989 --> 47:07.908
[growls]

47:20.003 --> 47:25.259
-Mew. Mew. Mew. Mew!
-[Team Rocket gasp]

47:28.720 --> 47:30.847
-[James] What was that?
-[Meowth] Beats me.

47:30.931 --> 47:33.308
[Jessie] It said "mew".

47:35.352 --> 47:37.229
Venusaur.

47:38.021 --> 47:41.108
[Mewtwo] Humans aspiring
to become Pokémon Trainers,

47:41.191 --> 47:44.903
first choose from three Pokémon
anyone can get.

47:44.987 --> 47:48.532
Bulbasaur, Squirtle and Charmander.

47:48.615 --> 47:51.660
These before you are their evolved forms.

47:51.743 --> 47:55.330
-They are my copies.
-Copies? Huh?

47:55.414 --> 47:58.709
[all gasping]

48:14.975 --> 48:18.437
-A battle arena!
-Are we being challenged to a battle?

48:18.520 --> 48:22.190
I choose to battle
with Bruteroot the Venusaur!

48:22.274 --> 48:23.734
Venusaur.

48:24.067 --> 48:27.112
And my partner? I choose Shellshocker!

48:27.195 --> 48:28.739
Blastoise.

48:28.822 --> 48:32.117
Me, too! Charizard, I choose you!

48:38.790 --> 48:42.502
[yawns and grunts]

48:50.052 --> 48:52.596
[roars]

48:55.182 --> 48:59.394
-Charizard! I didn't say start.
-Pika. Pika.

49:09.196 --> 49:12.074
Your Charizard is poorly trained.

49:12.616 --> 49:14.117
[grunts]

49:17.412 --> 49:18.705
[grunts angrily]

49:36.723 --> 49:38.934
Which of you will oppose me first?

49:39.226 --> 49:42.896
I underestimated you once,
but that won’t happen again!

49:42.979 --> 49:44.773
Saur!

49:46.942 --> 49:48.860
Venu.

49:58.995 --> 50:02.124
Go, Bruteroot! Use Razor Leaf!

50:02.207 --> 50:04.126
[roar]

50:04.209 --> 50:05.752
Use Vine Whip.

50:05.836 --> 50:07.295
[roars]

50:11.299 --> 50:13.802
Venusaur!

50:13.885 --> 50:15.512
[gasps]

50:15.595 --> 50:17.472
[grunts]

50:19.599 --> 50:22.352
Venusaur.

50:22.436 --> 50:24.730
Venusaur!

50:24.813 --> 50:26.231
Use Energy Ball!

50:26.314 --> 50:31.528
Saur!

50:33.530 --> 50:34.823
Yes!

50:35.991 --> 50:40.120
Venusaur.

50:40.704 --> 50:41.621
Oh!

50:41.705 --> 50:43.665
Use Leaf Storm.

50:43.749 --> 50:48.086
Venusaur!

50:48.962 --> 50:51.882
Sau-saur!

50:51.965 --> 50:52.924
[gasps]

50:57.512 --> 50:59.181
Venusaur.

50:59.264 --> 51:02.142
[gasps and pants] Bruteroot!

51:04.269 --> 51:05.479
Are you okay?

51:05.979 --> 51:07.439
I’m battling you now!

51:08.315 --> 51:10.358
Go, Shellshocker! Use Skull Bash!

51:10.442 --> 51:13.612
-Blastoise!
-[Mewtwo] Use Skull Bash.

51:13.695 --> 51:15.739
Blastoise!

51:17.407 --> 51:19.618
Blastoise!

51:23.622 --> 51:25.415
Shellshocker, use Hydro Pump!

51:25.499 --> 51:28.293
Blastoise!

51:39.012 --> 51:40.138
Shellshocker!

51:40.222 --> 51:41.181
Blast...

51:42.933 --> 51:46.019
Ash, be careful!
Their moves are really strong!

51:46.102 --> 51:48.522
Yeah, I know! But don’t worry.

51:48.605 --> 51:51.608
None of those attacks can hurt you
as long as they don’t hit you!

51:51.691 --> 51:53.902
-[grunts]
-Hm.

51:56.029 --> 51:58.114
[roars]

52:00.033 --> 52:01.493
[grunts]

52:02.702 --> 52:03.578
[growls]

52:03.662 --> 52:07.958
-Okay, Charizard! Win it with speed!
-[Charizard growls]

52:15.632 --> 52:18.093

[growling and grunting]

52:26.601 --> 52:32.232
[growling and grunting]

52:36.903 --> 52:40.615
-How are you going to win it with speed?
-Ugh. They’re too fast.

52:40.699 --> 52:42.325
Pika! Pika!

52:47.497 --> 52:49.499
[roars]

53:06.933 --> 53:11.730
[growling]

53:17.152 --> 53:23.533
[grunting and groaning]

53:27.829 --> 53:29.289
[all gasp]

53:29.372 --> 53:31.499
Charizard!

53:31.583 --> 53:33.501
Use Seismic Toss.

53:37.130 --> 53:39.549
[roaring]

53:42.427 --> 53:44.512
[growls]

53:50.936 --> 53:52.520
[groans]

53:56.650 --> 54:01.112
-Charizard! [pants]
-[Pikachu] Pika!

54:04.157 --> 54:07.953
It seems you lack both speed and power.

54:13.416 --> 54:15.669
-Huh?
-[Pikachu] Pika?

54:15.752 --> 54:20.048
-[Ash gasps and grunts]
-Pi. Pi. Pika!

54:20.799 --> 54:24.678
[grunts]

54:25.345 --> 54:26.846
Shellshocker!

54:28.431 --> 54:31.309
Venusaur.

54:31.393 --> 54:33.311
[grunts and pants]

54:33.395 --> 54:36.272
-Bruteroot!
-Are you trying to steal our Pokémon?

54:36.356 --> 54:38.149
Steal? No.

54:38.233 --> 54:41.319
I am only making
more useful, stronger clones

54:41.403 --> 54:44.280
from these Pokémon,
of which you are so proud.

54:45.615 --> 54:47.617
-[gasps]
-Making clones?

54:47.701 --> 54:52.664
-Stop it! You can’t do that!
-Do not attempt to defy me!

54:52.747 --> 54:56.167
[groans and yells]

54:57.419 --> 54:59.045
[both groan]

54:59.129 --> 55:02.424
I make my own rules!

55:02.507 --> 55:04.926
-Here they come!
-Run, everybody!

55:05.010 --> 55:09.639
Pikachu!

55:09.723 --> 55:14.644
[all gasping and panting]

55:18.732 --> 55:21.526

55:24.237 --> 55:25.697
Gyarados!

55:29.826 --> 55:31.036
Seadra!

56:08.865 --> 56:13.703
Pidgeot! [shrieks]

56:22.879 --> 56:25.882
We’ve just got to get them
into their Poké Balls!

56:25.965 --> 56:27.175
A waste of time.

56:27.258 --> 56:30.929
-Bulbasaur, Squirtle, return!
-Bulbasaur.

56:32.430 --> 56:33.723
Got 'em!

56:33.807 --> 56:36.017
[gasps and grunts]

56:37.393 --> 56:39.020
That’s not possible.

56:39.312 --> 56:42.774
Anything is possible
with the Poké Balls I make!

56:43.483 --> 56:45.527
-[Misty] Be very quiet in there.
-Togepi.

56:47.487 --> 56:49.072
[pants softly]

56:56.412 --> 56:59.207
Psyduck!

56:59.290 --> 57:00.959
No! Psyduck!

Psyduck...

57:14.472 --> 57:18.393
Pika. Pika. Pikachu.

-Pika. Pika!
-[Ash groaning]

57:23.815 --> 57:27.318
-Pikachu, run away.
-Pikachu!

57:29.821 --> 57:32.699
-Run!
-Pi. Pi. Pikachu.

57:32.782 --> 57:38.872
Pi. Pika. Pi. Pi. Pi. Pikachu.

57:38.955 --> 57:44.711
Pi. Pi. Pi...

57:46.212 --> 57:50.300
Pikachu!

57:51.426 --> 57:53.595
Pi. Pi. Pi...

57:53.678 --> 57:56.097
Don’t let them get you! Pikachu!

57:56.181 --> 58:00.435
Pi. Pi. Pikachu!

58:00.518 --> 58:03.938
Pikachu!

58:04.022 --> 58:08.735
Pi. Pi. Pi. Pika. Pika!

58:10.653 --> 58:16.534
[panting]

58:16.618 --> 58:19.704
Oh! [groans and yells]

58:19.787 --> 58:22.123
[gasps and grunts]

58:32.008 --> 58:36.513
Pika. Pikachu!

58:40.600 --> 58:44.896
Pika. Pi. Pika. Pikachu.

58:47.774 --> 58:51.694
Pika. Pika. Pika!

58:51.778 --> 58:53.196
Pikachu!

58:53.279 --> 58:56.324
[Pikachu screams]

58:56.658 --> 58:57.700
Pika!

59:09.629 --> 59:13.716
[gasps and pants]

59:19.347 --> 59:21.516
[gasps and pants]

59:23.059 --> 59:26.312
[yells] Ah! Pikachu!

59:41.411 --> 59:43.788
[Jessie and James] Who's that Pokémon?

59:43.871 --> 59:45.790
It’s Scyther!

59:47.208 --> 59:49.085
It’s Dewgong!

59:51.170 --> 59:53.131
It’s Vileplume!

59:56.301 --> 01:00:01.472
[Meowth] Sandslash. Nidoqueen. Vaporeon.

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:06.519
And then of course, this one’s Meowth.

01:00:08.688 --> 01:00:10.773
-[Ash groans] Ow!
-[both] Huh?

01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:13.276
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:14.944
[both] It’s the Twerp!

01:00:15.361 --> 01:00:20.450
[gasps] Team Rocket! [pants and grunts]

01:00:20.533 --> 01:00:22.702
I don’t have time
for your dumb motto today!

01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:24.329
-Wait!
-Hey!

01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:30.126
[Jessie and James] Who’s that Pokémon?

01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:31.919
It’s Pikachu.

01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:37.258
[groans and screams]

01:00:46.267 --> 01:00:47.935
[whimpering]

01:00:50.855 --> 01:00:55.234
[groaning]

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:59.530
[yells and groans]

01:01:03.201 --> 01:01:05.787
-Pika.
-Pikachu.

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:07.747
Pika. Pi.

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:11.000
Pi. Pika.

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:14.003
Pikachu!

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:22.053
[Jessie and James]
Whoa! Look at all the copies.

01:01:42.407 --> 01:01:44.283
[meows]

01:01:47.453 --> 01:01:48.287
Golduck.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.129
-Hitmonlee.
-Scyther.

01:01:56.462 --> 01:01:59.882
-There’s no stopping them.
-Send in the clones.

01:01:59.966 --> 01:02:03.219
-Those are... clones?
-Pika?

01:02:18.025 --> 01:02:19.277
Vaporeon.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.904
Huh? The originals too?

01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:26.492
[exclaiming]

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:28.745
[all] Stay out of my space!

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:36.753
Squirtle!

01:02:36.836 --> 01:02:39.505
-Squirtle!
-Pika! Pika!

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:43.718
-Squirtle! Squirtle! Squirtle! Squirtle!
-Pikachu!

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.223
Bulba.

01:02:49.307 --> 01:02:51.976
-Bulbasaur!
-Pikachu! Pika!

01:02:52.059 --> 01:02:55.605
-Squirtle.
-Pikachu.

01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:00.193
-Pika.
-Squirtle. Squirtle.

01:03:02.695 --> 01:03:04.739
[chuckles]

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:07.867
[grunts in determination]

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:37.522
Humans, I have no desire
to cause you harm.

01:03:37.605 --> 01:03:40.107
Simply go home now!

01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:41.692
[all] Huh?

01:03:42.276 --> 01:03:44.654
[wind howls]

01:03:46.322 --> 01:03:49.283
That is, if you can make it home
through the storm.

01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:50.535
[grunting]

01:03:58.125 --> 01:03:59.168
What was that?

01:04:02.797 --> 01:04:06.050
[all grunt and gibber]

01:04:35.413 --> 01:04:38.291
[Ash] You can’t do this.

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:40.001
I won’t let you!

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.714
-It’s Ash!
-All right!

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:51.721
[roars]

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:56.851
Psyduck.

01:04:57.643 --> 01:05:00.062
-It’s Psyduck!
-Vulpix!

01:05:11.616 --> 01:05:12.909
Squirtle.

01:05:15.828 --> 01:05:17.496
[grunts in determination]

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.081
You set them free?

01:05:19.373 --> 01:05:21.584
That’s right. I had to.

01:05:21.667 --> 01:05:23.878
I’ll protect all my friends!

01:05:23.961 --> 01:05:28.174
[grunts and yells]

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:31.218
[groans and grunts]

01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:33.262
[grunts]

01:05:35.723 --> 01:05:37.642
-Ash, oh, no!
-Stop it now!

01:05:37.725 --> 01:05:40.519
[Ash screams]

01:05:42.146 --> 01:05:45.858
[grunts and gasps]

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:47.318
What is this?

01:05:47.902 --> 01:05:49.737
Mew. Mew.

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:52.823
-Huh?
-Mew. Mew. Mew!

01:05:52.907 --> 01:05:55.034
[Ash yells and groans]

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:56.744
Mew.

01:05:57.995 --> 01:05:59.538
Mew.

01:06:01.082 --> 01:06:02.124
-Mew.
-Huh?

01:06:03.209 --> 01:06:05.920
Mew. Mew. Mew!

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:11.467
-Is that...?
-A Pokémon?

01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:13.427
Mew...

01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:15.137
Mew!

01:06:16.347 --> 01:06:21.811
[meows playfully]

01:06:37.743 --> 01:06:38.577
Mew.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:42.123
Mew.

01:06:45.209 --> 01:06:47.920
Mew. Mew!

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:49.839
I’ve read about that one.

01:06:49.922 --> 01:06:52.049
Right. It’s the Mythical Pokémon.

01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:55.511
[Mewtwo] Mew,
said to be the only one of its kind

01:06:55.594 --> 01:06:58.347
and the strongest Pokémon alive.

01:06:58.431 --> 01:06:59.640
Mew?

01:06:59.724 --> 01:07:01.434
-So, it does exist.
-Yes.

01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:04.687
[Mewtwo]
However, I am the strongest Pokémon!

01:07:05.604 --> 01:07:07.898
I may have been made from part of you.

01:07:07.982 --> 01:07:12.236
But now I will prove
that Mewtwo is better than the original,

01:07:12.319 --> 01:07:13.946
superior to Mew!

01:07:14.405 --> 01:07:15.698
Mew.

01:07:16.073 --> 01:07:18.117
Mew and Mewtwo...

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.453
Then Mewtwo was made from Mew.

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:22.705
-Pika.
-Squirtle.

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:26.125
This world is too small for two of us!

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:36.469
Why do you flee from me?

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:39.472
Are you afraid to find out
which of us is greater?

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:41.098
[meows]

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:51.734
[grunts]

01:07:51.817 --> 01:07:53.152
[Mew meows]

01:07:57.531 --> 01:07:58.908
[meows]

01:08:05.039 --> 01:08:08.125
[meows]

01:08:09.794 --> 01:08:10.628
[grunts]

01:08:11.378 --> 01:08:13.422
-[Mew gasps]
-[Ash gasps]

01:08:14.006 --> 01:08:15.174
[Ash gasps]

01:08:18.135 --> 01:08:20.179
[all gasp]

01:08:20.261 --> 01:08:22.640
-Saur.
-Hm!

01:08:30.272 --> 01:08:31.189
[meows]

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:37.488
[Mewtwo]
So you do have some fight in you.

01:08:41.533 --> 01:08:44.662
But I have no time for games.
Destiny is at hand!

01:08:44.745 --> 01:08:47.372
Who will rule? My super Pokémon?

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:50.960
Or your pathetic group
of inferior Pokémon?

01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:56.506
We were created with powers far stronger
than the originals!

01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:59.510
[Mew meows excitedly]

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:05.182
-Hm, it’s talking truth.
-Translation?

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:10.895
[Meowth] Mew says you don’t prove anything
by showing off a lot of fancy moves.

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:14.399
The Pokémon’s real strength
comes from the heart!

01:09:15.776 --> 01:09:18.444
A Pokémon’s real strength, you say?
[grunts]

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:25.618
[yells and grunts]

01:09:25.911 --> 01:09:30.040
Very well! My clones
don’t need moves to prove their worth!

01:09:30.916 --> 01:09:33.794
Now we shall see who triumphs!

01:09:33.877 --> 01:09:35.880
[roaring]

01:09:35.962 --> 01:09:38.591
[all clamoring and gibbering]

01:09:41.468 --> 01:09:47.474
[grunts and pant]

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:56.609
[gasps]

01:09:56.692 --> 01:09:59.695
[all gibbering]

01:10:28.682 --> 01:10:30.351
[Pidgeotto shrieks]

01:10:31.518 --> 01:10:35.522
[shrieking and gibbering]

01:10:40.444 --> 01:10:42.529
[Ash grunts]

01:10:54.375 --> 01:10:57.419
[Psyduck grunts]

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:07.054
Pika...

01:11:07.721 --> 01:11:10.266
[Dewgong groans]

01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:11.850
Pika...

01:11:13.143 --> 01:11:15.938
Pi... Pika?

01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:20.567
[Pikachu clone growls]

01:11:21.902 --> 01:11:23.570
Pika...

01:11:32.746 --> 01:11:36.959
[Ash pants]

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:42.131
[grunts]

01:11:47.886 --> 01:11:50.472
[Pikachu grunts and pants]

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:51.557
Pi!

01:11:52.057 --> 01:11:54.018
[Pikachu groans and pants]

01:11:55.519 --> 01:11:56.687
Pika!

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:45.152
What good is this fighting?

01:12:45.861 --> 01:12:49.031
They’re either originals or copies!

01:12:49.114 --> 01:12:50.783
But they’re all alive!

01:12:50.866 --> 01:12:52.701
This is wrong.

01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:57.081
Even if they’re copies,
they’re all living in the same world.

01:12:57.164 --> 01:13:01.502
Originals and copies.
They’re all living creatures!

01:13:01.585 --> 01:13:03.962
Does winning or losing really matter?

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:10.552
[James] We tell others to prepare for
trouble, but I’m not prepared for this.

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:13.305
It troubles my heart
to see them all this way.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:16.225
It seems like
they’re only hurting themselves.

01:13:16.308 --> 01:13:21.688
-It’s like seeing your old self...
-Battling with your present self.

01:13:22.356 --> 01:13:25.526
A blast-off bad dream!

01:13:25.609 --> 01:13:27.694
[sighs]

01:13:27.778 --> 01:13:30.656
Huh? [shrieks]

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:34.076
-[clone howls and hisses]
-[Meowth growls]

01:13:35.119 --> 01:13:37.246
I’ll bet these claws hurt.

01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:40.416
[Meowth clone meows softly]

01:13:40.499 --> 01:13:41.917
[Meowth sighs]

01:13:43.377 --> 01:13:46.380
You’ve got a lot of nerve
being here, you know?

01:13:46.463 --> 01:13:48.465
The rest are duking it out!

01:13:48.966 --> 01:13:51.969
[meows]

01:13:52.052 --> 01:13:55.431
Eh? You’re telling me
I’ve got even more nerve?

01:13:55.514 --> 01:13:57.641
Just 'cause I’m not duking it out?

01:13:58.392 --> 01:13:59.560
[meows]

01:13:59.643 --> 01:14:02.938
Oh, so you think my claws
would hurt a lot, too.

01:14:03.647 --> 01:14:04.523
[meows]

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:07.776
Well, your claws
would hurt a lot more, you know.

01:14:08.652 --> 01:14:10.571
[meows]

01:14:11.738 --> 01:14:14.741
[Meowth] You want to know
if tonight’s gonna be a full moon?

01:14:14.825 --> 01:14:18.662
Yup. I think tonight is gonna be
a full moon, filled to the top!

01:14:18.745 --> 01:14:19.746
[meows]

01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:23.167
[Meowth] Wow. Thinking of the moon
at a time like this...

01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:26.211
You know, palley, you’ve got class.

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:27.588
[meows]

01:14:39.266 --> 01:14:45.731
Pika! [pants]

[gasps] Pikachu!

01:15:00.412 --> 01:15:03.415

01:16:00.806 --> 01:16:04.601
[both pant]

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:07.688
Stop, please! Knock it off!

01:16:07.771 --> 01:16:10.023
[grunts]

01:16:10.107 --> 01:16:12.859
-[Brock] Ash!
-[Misty] Ash!

01:16:12.943 --> 01:16:15.529
[pants] I’ve got to stop this!

01:16:15.612 --> 01:16:16.822
You can’t.

01:16:16.905 --> 01:16:20.617
Until Mew and Mewtwo stop,
the fighting goes on.

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:30.043
Living things won’t give up
their territory

01:16:30.127 --> 01:16:32.462
to other members of their own species.

01:16:33.171 --> 01:16:34.298
That means...

01:16:34.381 --> 01:16:38.385
They’ll battle until one is defeated...
till only one remains!

01:16:38.468 --> 01:16:40.387
[grunting]

01:16:41.221 --> 01:16:42.973
That’s how living things are?

01:16:43.056 --> 01:16:45.851
But Mewtwo was created by humans.

01:16:45.934 --> 01:16:48.520
And yet, it’s a living thing.

01:16:48.979 --> 01:16:52.858
They’re alive, all right.
Both Mew and Mewtwo.

01:16:52.941 --> 01:16:54.359
And Pikachu!

01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:56.612
And the other Pikachu too!

01:16:57.362 --> 01:16:59.489
-[both panting]
-Pika...

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.284

[pants and grunts]

01:18:17.234 --> 01:18:19.319
Will you guys stop?

01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:23.907
Knock it off!

01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:36.002
-What’s going on?
-What happened?

01:18:37.212 --> 01:18:38.505
Pika...

01:18:48.849 --> 01:18:53.437
Foolishness! A human
would actually attempt to stop our battle?

01:18:57.649 --> 01:19:01.278
[Pikachu pants]

01:19:01.361 --> 01:19:04.322

01:19:07.951 --> 01:19:09.286
Pika?

01:19:10.787 --> 01:19:12.289
Pika-Pi?

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:14.958
Pikachu...

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:19.004
Pika?

01:19:21.715 --> 01:19:23.049
Pika-Pi?

01:19:23.133 --> 01:19:26.052
[Pikachu] Pikachu... Pika-Pi?

01:19:27.304 --> 01:19:28.555
Bulba...

01:19:29.473 --> 01:19:31.808
-Squirtle...

-[sad grunting]
-Pika-Pi!

01:19:34.227 --> 01:19:36.021
Oh, no, Ash...

01:19:39.566 --> 01:19:40.859
Pika-Pi?

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:43.820
Pika?

01:19:47.491 --> 01:19:52.412

Pikachu!

01:20:42.921 --> 01:20:45.340
[Pikachu pants]

01:20:45.423 --> 01:20:50.095

-[squeals happily] Pika-Pi. Pika-Pi.
-[Ash laughs]

01:25:05.016 --> 01:25:11.439
It is true that both you and I
are living beings... Pokémon.

01:25:11.523 --> 01:25:12.565
[meows]

01:25:16.694 --> 01:25:21.574
I see now that the circumstances
of one’s birth are irrelevant.

01:25:22.242 --> 01:25:27.288
It is what you do with the gift of life
that determines who you are.

01:25:29.749 --> 01:25:30.750
Squirtle?

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:34.337
Squirtle! Squirtle!

Squirtle! Squirtle!

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:36.798
Huh?

01:26:46.659 --> 01:26:48.453
Pika!

01:26:49.704 --> 01:26:50.955
[Togepi squeals]

01:26:51.414 --> 01:26:53.791
Mewtwo, where will you go?

01:26:55.001 --> 01:26:58.838
Where my heart can learn
what yours knows so well.

01:26:59.297 --> 01:27:02.258
What transpired here,
I will always remember.

01:27:02.342 --> 01:27:05.887
But perhaps for you,
these events are best forgotten.

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:30.286
-Pika.
-[Ash] Huh?

01:27:30.745 --> 01:27:35.124
-Huh? Whoa. Whoa.
-Pika!

01:27:37.210 --> 01:27:39.295
[Ash] Oh. Oh!

01:27:43.675 --> 01:27:44.759
Oh!

01:28:00.275 --> 01:28:04.112
Please, quiet, everyone!
No boats will leave the harbor!

01:28:04.195 --> 01:28:07.240
This hurricane is stronger
than any seen here before.

01:28:07.615 --> 01:28:09.200
You must evacuate!

01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:11.286
Aw, why right now?

01:28:11.369 --> 01:28:14.122
Please remain calm
and I’ll do my best to help.

01:28:14.205 --> 01:28:18.209
The Pokémon Center will function
as a shelter, open to anyone!

01:28:18.293 --> 01:28:20.670
Come with me, if you wish to use it.

01:28:33.182 --> 01:28:36.811
Nurse Joy, Officer Jenny, Miranda, too!

01:28:36.894 --> 01:28:40.189
The rainwater
hardly blurs their radiant beauty!

01:28:41.524 --> 01:28:44.277
Huh? Why are we here in the first place?

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.154
It doesn’t make any sense.

01:28:46.237 --> 01:28:49.032
Well, since we’re already here, who cares?

01:28:49.115 --> 01:28:50.950
-Togepi!
-[laughter]

01:28:51.034 --> 01:28:53.953
-Yeah. Right!
-Pika!

01:28:54.037 --> 01:28:56.080
-[Brock and Misty] Hm?
Pika?

01:29:05.256 --> 01:29:07.258
[all gasp in awe]

01:29:16.684 --> 01:29:18.436
Like it never happened!

01:29:18.519 --> 01:29:22.398
-No hurricane...
-It disappeared!

01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:27.320
-The ships can sail first thing tomorrow.
-Right.

01:29:38.247 --> 01:29:42.752
-Oh, what’s that?
-What’s what?

01:29:44.962 --> 01:29:47.715
-You see that? Just up there!
-Pika?

01:29:47.799 --> 01:29:50.051
I didn’t see anything at all.

01:29:50.134 --> 01:29:52.053
Nothing but clouds.

01:29:52.136 --> 01:29:53.846
[gasps]

01:29:58.226 --> 01:30:02.063
[Ash] On the day I set out
and decided to become a Pokémon Master,

01:30:02.146 --> 01:30:05.525
I saw a really rare Pokémon,
just like I did now.

01:30:05.817 --> 01:30:09.278
Well, then maybe you’ll see
that one again sometime.

01:30:09.362 --> 01:30:12.115
-Huh?
-That really rare Pokémon!

01:30:12.198 --> 01:30:14.033
[Ash laughs]

01:30:14.117 --> 01:30:16.160
-Pika!
-[sighs]

01:30:18.996 --> 01:30:21.833
Mm. One day, for sure!

01:30:21.916 --> 01:30:24.001
-Pikachu!
-[laughs]

01:30:30.967 --> 01:30:32.927
[narrator] The world of Pokémon,

01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:35.138
full of mysteries and legends

01:30:35.221 --> 01:30:39.267
and the stories of those who dream
of becoming Pokémon Trainers,

01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:44.438
as well as the amazing Pokémon who live,
work and battle by their sides.

01:30:44.522 --> 01:30:49.026
As the journey continues,
for a long time to come!

01:30:53.239 --> 01:30:56.242
Beautiful! Everything clean and natural!

01:30:56.325 --> 01:30:57.827
Pristine, untouched!

01:30:57.910 --> 01:31:00.121
Now, that’s a big change.

01:31:00.663 --> 01:31:02.748
[all] And it sure does feel good!

01:31:03.166 --> 01:31:08.045
It’s about time!
