WEBVTT

00:06.297 --> 00:08.007
...four-term
incumbent Gotham mayor

00:08.090 --> 00:11.720
Don Mitchell, Jr., was
found murdered last night in...

00:11.803 --> 00:13.471
...his tough war on drugs...

00:15.015 --> 00:16.433
...notorious Mafia
crime figure,

00:16.516 --> 00:17.517
Salvatore Maroni...

00:17.600 --> 00:18.893
...sources tell GC1

00:18.977 --> 00:21.312
that a warrant
for Falcone's arrest

00:21.396 --> 00:22.981
is suspected to reach...

00:23.064 --> 00:25.025
...the second
high-profile murder

00:25.108 --> 00:26.151
in as many nights.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.486
This time, the killer
hasn't come forward to claim...

00:29.404 --> 00:30.947
We interrupt
election coverage now

00:31.031 --> 00:32.115
for some breaking news.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.159
We are getting
unconfirmed reports

00:34.242 --> 00:38.246
about a series of explosions
along the city's seawall.

00:39.122 --> 00:42.417
And we are live
watching the Batman vigilante

00:42.500 --> 00:44.169
atop Gotham Square Garden

00:44.252 --> 00:46.921
helping save the lives
of hundreds of injured victims

00:47.047 --> 00:49.758
after devastating explosions
took out the city's seawall.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.176
We will rebuild.

00:52.344 --> 00:53.636
But not just our city.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.182
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

00:57.265 --> 00:58.308
It's been a week

00:58.391 --> 01:00.268
since the terrorist
known as The Riddler

01:00.352 --> 01:01.895
blew up Gotham's seawall.

01:01.978 --> 01:03.438
And as the death toll climbs,

01:03.521 --> 01:05.815
Gotham residents are demanding
answers from authorities.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.151
While the wealthier suburbs
have been spared,

01:08.234 --> 01:10.195
it's Gotham's
poorest neighborhoods

01:10.278 --> 01:13.031
that have been hit the hardest,
especially in Crown Point.

01:13.114 --> 01:15.158
Looting and rioting
have become the norm.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.660
Combined with the scarcity
of illicit drugs

01:17.744 --> 01:19.454
and an increase
in gang warfare,

01:19.537 --> 01:21.789
the city has reached
a boiling point.

01:21.914 --> 01:24.668
The murder of longtime mob boss
Carmine Falcone

01:24.751 --> 01:26.294
outside the Iceberg Lounge

01:26.378 --> 01:28.963
has complicated efforts
to restore order,

01:29.047 --> 01:32.133
creating a power vacuum
in Gotham's underworld.

01:32.759 --> 01:33.968
Rumors are swirling

01:34.051 --> 01:36.388
that Carmine's son,
Alberto Falcone,

01:36.429 --> 01:38.223
is set
to take his father's place

01:38.348 --> 01:40.558
despite his public struggles
with alcohol.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.769
After this shakeup
in leadership,

01:42.852 --> 01:44.854
insiders worry
about their future

01:44.938 --> 01:48.441
within the Falcone organization
and wonder what will become

01:48.525 --> 01:51.110
of Gotham's
most notorious family.

04:09.874 --> 04:12.961
Oh, beautiful.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

04:28.184 --> 04:30.228
I see you've made yourself
at home.

04:32.731 --> 04:35.442
Hey, Alberto, you're here.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.445
Good. Saves me a trip.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.155
What the fuck
are you talking about?

04:40.238 --> 04:42.615
These jewels belong to you.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.492
Your dad made that clear.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.077
But some of the guys,

04:46.161 --> 04:48.580
well, you know,
they're goddamn scavengers.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.498
So I thought I'd do you a solid.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.000
As a show of support for...

04:53.293 --> 04:54.336
your new position.

04:55.670 --> 04:56.504
Well...

04:57.213 --> 04:58.381
congratulations.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.135
I only wish it had been
under different circumstances.

05:02.886 --> 05:03.720
Carmine...

05:05.138 --> 05:06.097
he was a...

05:07.349 --> 05:08.558
He was a great man.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.227
You got some big shoes to fill.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.024
Not too big.

05:16.107 --> 05:18.401
I mean, you know,
manageable shoes.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.195
You think I'm an idiot?

05:20.779 --> 05:22.113
You greedy prick.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.615
My father's been dead a week.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.033
Hey, Al.

05:27.494 --> 05:28.453
You all right?

05:29.454 --> 05:32.123
'Cause we keep a stash
in the loft if you want a hit.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.043
That's not why I'm here.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.586
Of course not.
I was only saying--

05:36.670 --> 05:37.754
You don't get it.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.172
Everyone's looking to me now.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.133
I got this deal going, and...

05:44.386 --> 05:46.388
I can't. I gotta
keep my head on straight.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.806
Yeah, you're right, Boss.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.808
I got no idea
the pressure you're under.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.479
But you're
Alberto Friggin' Falcone,

05:55.522 --> 05:57.524
the new kingpin of Gotham.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.611
We should celebrate that.

06:03.279 --> 06:07.158
Listen, staying off the Drops,
good on you.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.828
But booze don't count.

06:10.412 --> 06:11.246
Does it?

06:18.878 --> 06:20.338
So this new deal
you got going...

06:21.089 --> 06:22.424
Maybe I can help.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.551
You know what
I like most about you, Oz?

06:25.135 --> 06:27.137
You are who you are,

06:27.220 --> 06:28.847
and you couldn't change
if you tried.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.974
Ain't that what makes me fun?

06:36.771 --> 06:38.314
Yeah, go on.

06:39.024 --> 06:39.941
This shit's good.

06:40.025 --> 06:40.942
Good.

06:41.484 --> 06:44.779
But after a while,
you get curious.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.740
There's gotta be something else
out there,

06:47.532 --> 06:49.034
a new kind of high.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.161
So you're gonna, what?

06:52.037 --> 06:53.288
Alter the formula?

06:53.371 --> 06:55.874
We're not just adding ketchup
to fries, man.

06:55.957 --> 06:59.252
I'm talking about
revolutionizing the game.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.255
Fuck. Look at you salivating.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.257
Fine.

07:06.551 --> 07:07.635
You got a girl?

07:08.303 --> 07:09.804
Good-looking guy like you...

07:11.348 --> 07:12.349
Here.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.768
Just keep quiet.

07:14.851 --> 07:17.437
I can't have Viti and those guys
knowing what I've got going

07:17.520 --> 07:19.522
until this new drug's
up on its feet.

07:21.566 --> 07:22.567
Thanks, Boss. It's...

07:24.819 --> 07:26.112
real generous.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.156
Pop always said
you were a good soldier.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.325
It's what he liked most
about you.

07:32.159 --> 07:34.162
But he also knew
you were a dirty soldier

07:34.245 --> 07:35.955
who skims money off the top.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.209
It's okay, man.
You were smart about it.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.086
Never took enough
for Pop to mind.

07:41.753 --> 07:42.879
See, he knew what it meant

07:42.962 --> 07:44.881
for a guy like you
to get a piece.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.425
How it made you feel.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.011
And that was good for business.

07:50.637 --> 07:54.224
Carmine Falcone was a master
at the carrot and stick.

07:57.519 --> 07:58.603
See what I got on?

07:59.771 --> 08:02.023
Your dad's ring. Nice.

08:02.107 --> 08:03.400
Wasn't always his.

08:04.442 --> 08:05.902
Used to be Salvatore's.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.864
-Salvatore Maroni?
-He wore Sal's ring as a trophy.

08:09.948 --> 08:11.533
The ultimate fuck-you.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.078
This is power, right?

08:17.414 --> 08:18.248
Wanna try it on?

08:19.082 --> 08:19.916
Nah.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.209
It's yours.

08:22.627 --> 08:23.461
Yeah.

08:27.424 --> 08:28.550
I don't know, man.

08:30.385 --> 08:31.803
You think I could be
as good as him?

08:32.971 --> 08:34.472
Get his kind of respect?

08:36.390 --> 08:37.225
Your father?

08:39.977 --> 08:40.979
Sure, Boss.

08:42.147 --> 08:42.981
If you want.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.483
But there are different kinds
of power.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.362
When I was kid,

08:50.447 --> 08:51.489
there was a gangster,

08:52.323 --> 08:53.742
real old-school type,

08:54.784 --> 08:55.910
Rex Calabrese.

08:56.911 --> 08:57.871
He was a big deal.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.165
Yeah. At least,
in my neighborhood.

09:01.499 --> 09:02.542
He helped people.

09:03.835 --> 09:05.545
When someone in your family
was sick,

09:06.087 --> 09:07.547
he'd find you a doctor.

09:08.923 --> 09:11.634
Short on rent,
front you the cash.

09:13.303 --> 09:14.763
Knew everyone's names, too.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.100
I don't know how he kept them
all in his head, but...

09:19.726 --> 09:20.977
He saw you on the street,

09:22.062 --> 09:23.104
he'd call out to you,

09:23.855 --> 09:24.731
ask how you were.

09:26.441 --> 09:27.692
Felt like he meant it, too.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.947
When I'm 14 or something,

09:33.823 --> 09:35.283
he has a heart attack and dies,

09:36.576 --> 09:37.994
still holding his cigar.

09:39.496 --> 09:40.580
In my neighborhood,

09:41.581 --> 09:43.208
they throw a parade
in his honor.

09:44.668 --> 09:46.044
A friggin' parade.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.964
I mean, it wasn't fancy,
but it was the gesture...

09:50.840 --> 09:51.758
the show of love...

09:52.842 --> 09:53.885
of what he meant.

09:55.387 --> 09:56.429
Can you imagine?

09:57.389 --> 09:59.140
To be remembered like that?

09:59.224 --> 10:00.350
Revered?

10:02.143 --> 10:03.019
What is this?

10:06.398 --> 10:09.901
You want me to be like
some small-time asshole?

10:12.278 --> 10:13.988
-Nah, that ain't--
-For what?

10:16.491 --> 10:18.952
Would that make it easier
for you to take what's mine?

10:22.580 --> 10:24.249
Or is this you?

10:25.333 --> 10:26.543
What you want?

10:28.461 --> 10:29.337
No.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.177
Holy shit, it is!

10:38.930 --> 10:40.223
This is your dream.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.642
It's so sweet, too.

10:43.435 --> 10:44.644
And so pathetic.

10:45.395 --> 10:48.857
You really think people'd make
a float of your dumb face

10:48.940 --> 10:52.027
and march it down the street,
chanting your goddamn name?

10:54.904 --> 10:59.159
"Oswald Cobb.
Remember him? What a guy!"

11:01.077 --> 11:02.620
What a little bitch!

11:31.566 --> 11:34.361
Aw, fu--

12:35.255 --> 12:36.256
Hurry up, bro.

12:36.339 --> 12:37.382
Relax. I got it.

12:37.882 --> 12:38.758
Hey, help him out.

12:38.842 --> 12:40.427
Hurry up, man.
Just turn the damn thing.

12:40.510 --> 12:41.803
Hey!

12:43.013 --> 12:43.847
Hey!

12:43.972 --> 12:45.724
-Oh, shi--
-You sons of bitches!

12:45.807 --> 12:46.808
Go! Go!

12:46.891 --> 12:48.518
Get the fuck out of here! Go!

12:48.601 --> 12:50.770
-Oh, shit!
-Hey!

12:50.854 --> 12:52.939
-Wait. Wait. Okay, I'm done.
-Go! Go!

12:53.023 --> 12:55.442
-Please! Please! All right.
-Don't you try and run.

12:55.525 --> 12:58.111
I'm sorry. I-I'm sorry. I'm--

12:58.194 --> 13:00.030
Don't move,
you twat-faced little prick.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.364
Trying to steal my shit!

13:02.407 --> 13:04.034
-Hey!
-Shut the fuck up.

13:04.576 --> 13:07.412
You wanna shout again?
You wanna fucking shout again?

13:07.495 --> 13:08.955
You messed with
the wrong fucking guy

13:09.039 --> 13:10.123
on the wrong fucking night.

13:10.206 --> 13:13.585
P-p-p...

13:13.668 --> 13:15.462
Please, please, please.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.132
Don't, okay, please?

13:21.926 --> 13:24.179
P-please!

13:24.262 --> 13:26.389
-Please, don't--
-Jesus! Take a breath.

13:27.265 --> 13:28.099
What have we got here?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.939
"Victor Aguilar."

13:41.696 --> 13:43.239
I'm keeping your ID.

13:44.866 --> 13:45.992
Walk. That way.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.334
Head first.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.673
Fucking foot! God damn it!

14:06.471 --> 14:08.181
Hey! Hey, look at me.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.557
How far do you think you'd get?

14:10.058 --> 14:12.894
This scumbag,
he disrespected me.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.688
-You gonna disrespect me, Vic?
-No. No.

14:14.771 --> 14:17.482
No. 'Cause you and me,
we're in this together now.

14:18.900 --> 14:19.943
Which means...

14:20.652 --> 14:21.736
I own you.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.449
Look what you
fucking made me do.

14:28.493 --> 14:29.994
You're gonna do
everything I say.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.206
Or else I'll murder you and...

14:33.289 --> 14:34.708
anyone you care about.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.751
-You got it?
-Yeah.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.004
Beautiful.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.172
I feel better. You feel better?

14:42.215 --> 14:43.049
Yeah.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.217
Good.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.927
Now, you wanted my car so badly,

14:46.428 --> 14:47.303
you can drive.

14:51.891 --> 14:52.726
Go on.

15:16.833 --> 15:17.876
Make a left up here.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.128
Okay.

15:31.598 --> 15:32.974
This fucking douchebag...

15:35.060 --> 15:36.269
Here we go.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.568
Got you now, you piece of shit.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.363
S-should I--

16:02.212 --> 16:03.463
What do you think of this?

16:04.464 --> 16:06.633
It's a... little air freshener.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.804
Aqua Paradise.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.765
-You smell it?
-Mm-hmm.

16:13.848 --> 16:14.766
It's nice, huh?

16:18.144 --> 16:19.646
-It's nice, yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.398
Yeah, it's nice.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.569
194 Tower Avenue.

16:28.113 --> 16:29.614
The old tenement on Sixth.

16:31.199 --> 16:32.450
I'm from the Eastside, too.

16:33.034 --> 16:34.119
I mean, not Crown Point.

16:34.953 --> 16:36.246
Further out from the port.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.167
You ever been
to that corner mart?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.045
Next to the...

16:44.629 --> 16:45.714
Coin-O-Matic?

16:49.676 --> 16:50.635
Buddy's?

16:52.679 --> 16:53.847
Yeah, Buddy's.

16:53.972 --> 16:54.889
Oh, man.

16:55.974 --> 16:57.892
They still sell
those Slush Puppies?

16:58.810 --> 17:00.979
I th-think so.

17:01.688 --> 17:02.772
Me and my brothers,

17:03.565 --> 17:05.650
we used to go there
every day in the summer.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.986
You know, we'd mix the flavors
for a suicide.

17:09.112 --> 17:10.320
You ever mix the flavors?

17:10.405 --> 17:11.239
Huh-uh.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.491
Aw. You missed out.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.621
You know, but I'd like to.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.708
You know, like in the...
in the future.

17:23.710 --> 17:24.711
Take a left here.

17:35.597 --> 17:38.058
Hi, Daddy.
Wanna come party with us?

17:38.141 --> 17:40.185
Nice car. Can I get a ride?

17:41.978 --> 17:45.357
Wh-wh-what about the body?
Is that safe on the street?

17:45.440 --> 17:46.858
Why?
Your friends wanna steal it?

17:48.151 --> 17:50.028
Do me a favor, kid.
Shut your goddamn mouth.

17:50.111 --> 17:53.031
-Lookin' good. Ladies.
-Hey, Oz.

17:53.114 --> 17:54.324
-Who is this?
-Good to see you.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.575
Looks brand-new.

17:55.658 --> 17:56.993
Like what you see, sweetie?

18:21.267 --> 18:22.394
-Hey.
-Oz.

18:23.311 --> 18:24.145
Baby.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.731
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:26.815 --> 18:28.108
Who's your friend?

18:31.361 --> 18:32.570
You alone?

18:33.279 --> 18:36.658
I... I ain't trying
to get in your business, but...

18:37.951 --> 18:39.327
I need an alibi.

18:40.412 --> 18:41.788
Ideally, for the whole night.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.082
Sounds like we had fun.

18:44.666 --> 18:46.960
I'm serious, Eve. Yeah.

18:47.544 --> 18:48.545
Can you help me out?

18:49.170 --> 18:51.047
Anytime after 10,
but not before.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.841
All right, that'll work.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.012
Thanks, doll.

18:57.095 --> 18:58.513
I'll call ya.

19:05.937 --> 19:07.397
You hungry?
I'm hungry. Let's go.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.445
Stupid night.

19:21.870 --> 19:23.913
I asked for extra pickles,
and they give me two?

19:24.664 --> 19:26.624
So what, a normal amount
of pickles is one?

19:27.167 --> 19:28.626
Makes no goddamn sense.

19:33.840 --> 19:34.966
You want one of mine?

19:35.675 --> 19:37.010
Do I want one of your pickles?

19:37.594 --> 19:39.888
That your dirty little mouth
touched? No, kid, I don't.

19:39.971 --> 19:40.930
Jesus.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.602
Shit! Would you look at that?

19:47.354 --> 19:49.105
Imagine if you
and your buddies came here

19:49.189 --> 19:50.565
instead of trying
to steal from me.

19:52.776 --> 19:54.444
Coulda saved you
a lot of trouble.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.612
What was your plan anyway?

19:55.695 --> 19:58.531
Sell 'em to a scrapyard
for some extra dough?

20:00.742 --> 20:02.369
You got a dollar
in your wallet, kid.

20:02.452 --> 20:04.120
Can you afford
to think that small?

20:05.789 --> 20:07.040
No goddamn ambition.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.127
Snuff out the fire.
We're losing time.

20:28.687 --> 20:29.688
All right, good here.

20:43.827 --> 20:44.786
On three.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.290
You know what? Just do it.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.106
Hold up there, chief.

21:15.150 --> 21:16.484
There's a nice sunrise
behind you.

21:16.568 --> 21:17.652
You should take a look.

21:20.447 --> 21:21.281
Go on.

21:22.741 --> 21:23.992
Please don't do this. No.

21:25.326 --> 21:26.327
Hey, wait.

21:26.995 --> 21:28.288
No, no, no, no.

21:28.371 --> 21:30.331
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

21:30.415 --> 21:31.374
Stop!

21:33.626 --> 21:34.794
Ever had one of these?

21:49.726 --> 21:50.560
There you go.

21:57.942 --> 21:59.527
His name's Alberto Falcone.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.572
He's the new king--
Well, was the new kingpin

22:02.655 --> 22:03.865
of the Falcone mob.

22:06.076 --> 22:06.910
Yeah.

22:07.494 --> 22:09.037
So, the smart play here
is to kill you

22:09.120 --> 22:10.580
and stuff you in the trunk
with Stinky,

22:10.663 --> 22:12.374
-be done with both of youse.
-No, no, no.

22:12.457 --> 22:13.500
We-we don't have to--

22:13.625 --> 22:15.543
It's a goddamn fact, Vic.
It just is.

22:15.627 --> 22:17.879
No, no, no, no, no.
Wait. Wait! Hold on!

22:18.463 --> 22:19.339
You can't.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.133
I could help you.

22:22.676 --> 22:23.551
You know?

22:25.011 --> 22:26.721
With whatever you need,
I can help you.

22:26.805 --> 22:28.181
Yeah. And how do I need you?

22:31.518 --> 22:32.644
I got ambition.

22:33.561 --> 22:36.356
And I'm not...
I'm not a waste, okay? I'm not.

22:36.439 --> 22:39.359
I could... I could help you
w-with whatever it is.

22:39.442 --> 22:42.529
Wh-wh-whatever you need,
whatever it is, all right?

22:43.113 --> 22:44.322
I just--

22:45.281 --> 22:46.825
Please, I need a chance.

22:48.326 --> 22:50.412
-I need a chance!
-All right, calm down.

23:03.842 --> 23:06.136
Well, maybe it'd be useful,
keeping you around.

23:06.219 --> 23:07.053
For now.

23:08.138 --> 23:09.431
See if you got what you say.

23:10.974 --> 23:12.517
But if you step out of line
just once,

23:12.600 --> 23:14.769
I swear to God, I'll gut you
like a fucking fish.

23:14.853 --> 23:15.687
Do you understand?

23:15.770 --> 23:17.480
Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

23:17.564 --> 23:18.982
-Do you understand?
-Yeah. Yeah.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.108
Good.

23:23.903 --> 23:24.946
Now, shut the fuck up.

23:26.031 --> 23:27.323
I wanna watch the sunrise.

24:01.274 --> 24:02.776
We ain't got a lot of time.

24:03.860 --> 24:05.153
I gotta be at work soon.

24:06.404 --> 24:08.823
'Cause, you know,
it's any other day.

24:10.992 --> 24:12.702
You can use the sink
to clean up.

24:14.579 --> 24:16.039
Touch anything, I'll know.

25:27.110 --> 25:28.153
Look at this.

25:29.654 --> 25:31.656
What that fucking madman did.

25:54.387 --> 25:55.889
Hey, Nick, come here.

25:55.972 --> 25:58.433
Bring a pen
and one of them envelopes.

25:59.517 --> 26:00.352
What's up?

26:01.561 --> 26:04.064
Get this to Councilman Hady.

26:04.856 --> 26:07.525
He's a... big fan of Bella Reál.

26:08.985 --> 26:09.819
He...

26:10.528 --> 26:12.739
likes to tout himself
as one of the good ones,

26:13.406 --> 26:15.658
but he got into
some serious debt with Carmine.

26:15.742 --> 26:17.827
We all got our own vices.

26:18.495 --> 26:19.621
All right.

26:20.205 --> 26:22.165
Make sure he knows
it's from me, all right?

26:22.248 --> 26:23.333
Come on, kid.

26:29.589 --> 26:31.383
Hey, Doc. How we lookin'?

26:31.466 --> 26:34.010
Well, we've recovered
about 30% of the product.

26:34.094 --> 26:35.845
There's a risk of contamination.

26:35.929 --> 26:38.014
Most of the Drops
were fished out of sewer water.

26:38.098 --> 26:40.350
That ain't gonna stop Dropheads
from buying it.

26:40.433 --> 26:42.143
-No.
-Give the people what they want.

26:42.227 --> 26:43.395
All right.

26:43.478 --> 26:44.896
Get him in.

26:44.979 --> 26:46.106
What the fuck is that?

26:48.775 --> 26:50.068
Mikey, what the hell happened?

26:50.151 --> 26:51.861
Got jumped by the Odessa Mob,
maybe.

26:51.945 --> 26:53.863
Or Burnley Town.
I don't know. It happened fast.

26:53.947 --> 26:55.699
But they got
the whole fucking stash.

26:55.782 --> 26:57.867
-What the fuck? Son of a bitch!
-Yep.

26:57.951 --> 27:00.161
Now we got every asshole
on the street testing fences.

27:00.245 --> 27:01.287
-It's fucking crazy.
-Oz!

27:01.371 --> 27:02.831
-What?
-It's the Family.

27:02.914 --> 27:04.290
-They wanna talk to you.
-Yeah.

27:04.833 --> 27:05.917
Get him outta here, to the back.

27:06.001 --> 27:07.335
You got it.
Let's get the man up.

27:10.088 --> 27:11.548
Let's go, buddy.

27:11.631 --> 27:12.465
Come on.

27:14.968 --> 27:15.802
Yeah.

27:23.727 --> 27:26.980
So, what does that...
what does that mean exactly,

27:27.063 --> 27:28.440
to... to be called in?

27:29.065 --> 27:30.025
Could mean anything.

27:30.108 --> 27:32.944
Do you... do you think
that they know?

27:33.028 --> 27:34.029
Jesus, kid.

27:34.612 --> 27:36.364
Am I holding
a fucking crystal ball?

27:41.661 --> 27:43.038
It's all a song and dance.

27:43.747 --> 27:45.415
Nine times out of ten,
these top-tier guys

27:45.498 --> 27:47.125
wanna meet face-to-face
to feel big,

27:47.250 --> 27:48.918
so I make myself small,

27:49.002 --> 27:50.253
they feel better
about themselves,

27:50.337 --> 27:51.629
and I get to go back to work.

27:53.757 --> 27:54.591
This is us.

28:06.561 --> 28:07.771
Damn!

28:19.366 --> 28:21.159
All right, listen,
if I don't come out...

28:25.455 --> 28:26.706
Nah, I'll be fine.

28:26.790 --> 28:28.750
You'll be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

28:31.127 --> 28:33.296
I'm messing with you, kid.
All right, just sit tight.

28:33.380 --> 28:34.714
Maybe look
for your sense of humor.

28:34.798 --> 28:36.383
It's gotta be here somewhere.

28:51.940 --> 28:52.857
Fellas.

29:01.324 --> 29:02.659
Johnny. Milos.

29:02.742 --> 29:03.910
Have a seat.

29:07.872 --> 29:11.001
Lot of pomp and circumstance
to be coming out here like this.

29:12.168 --> 29:13.420
Not that I'm complaining.

29:17.298 --> 29:19.759
So, we got something
to celebrate or what?

29:20.760 --> 29:22.387
We've decided
to shut down the plant.

29:22.971 --> 29:25.223
We're gonna move all operations
to Robbinsville.

29:25.807 --> 29:26.850
Hold up.

29:27.642 --> 29:28.935
What are you talking about?

29:29.019 --> 29:31.271
There's a lot less heat
in Robbinsville.

29:31.354 --> 29:33.189
Yeah, there's
a lot less business, too.

29:33.857 --> 29:35.900
You know how much cash
my guys bring in?

29:35.984 --> 29:38.319
This is my operation.
You can't just shut it down.

29:38.820 --> 29:39.696
No.

29:40.196 --> 29:42.699
This is our operation.
It's our guys.

29:42.782 --> 29:45.201
You work for the Family.
Have you forgotten that?

29:45.910 --> 29:47.787
Oz, we're consolidating.

29:47.871 --> 29:49.914
Most of the supplies,
they were damaged in the flood.

29:49.998 --> 29:51.082
Actually, that ain't true.

29:51.166 --> 29:53.335
Nah, we recovered
a lot of the product, 70%.

29:53.418 --> 29:55.378
It doesn't matter, all right?
The police are circling.

29:55.462 --> 29:57.130
Got a target on our back.
Gangs encroaching.

29:57.213 --> 29:59.007
There's blood in the water.
Everyone knows it.

29:59.090 --> 30:00.633
-And you wanna bail?
-Jesus Christ!

30:00.717 --> 30:02.510
If we don't protect what's ours,
we look weak.

30:02.594 --> 30:03.511
This isn't your call.

30:03.595 --> 30:05.513
You're handing the Maronis
or someone worse

30:05.597 --> 30:07.474
the keys to the fucking kingdom.
Don't you get that?

30:07.557 --> 30:09.768
The last thing we need
is a goddamn gang war!

30:09.851 --> 30:11.978
Now, Milos asked you here
as a courtesy,

30:12.062 --> 30:13.563
because he's a courteous guy.

30:13.646 --> 30:14.481
I am not.

30:15.065 --> 30:16.274
You will do as you're told.

30:18.985 --> 30:19.819
You're free to leave.

30:24.032 --> 30:25.825
Well, wait a second.

30:29.329 --> 30:30.872
What if I could fix it?

30:30.955 --> 30:31.831
This?

30:32.415 --> 30:35.168
I mean, at the end of the day,
this is all about money, right?

30:35.919 --> 30:38.421
Maybe we don't see eye-to-eye
on every little thing.

30:38.505 --> 30:39.964
You know,
maybe you don't like me.

30:40.590 --> 30:42.842
That's fine.
I'm an acquired taste.

30:43.551 --> 30:44.636
But I make you money.

30:45.512 --> 30:46.971
And I got wind
of a shipment coming in.

30:47.806 --> 30:50.308
I don't wanna tout it too much,
but it's big.

30:50.392 --> 30:51.601
In fact, it's got the potential

30:51.685 --> 30:53.478
to revolutionize
the drug business.

30:54.729 --> 30:57.774
-What kind of shipment?
-I can't reveal the details yet.

30:57.857 --> 30:59.442
Nah, nah, but it's brand-new.

31:00.610 --> 31:02.821
Something that'll help us
expand beyond Drops.

31:03.530 --> 31:06.241
And all you guys gotta do is
sit back and reap the rewards.

31:06.324 --> 31:07.784
I'll oversee the whole thing.

31:07.867 --> 31:10.203
I'll use some of the crew.
I'll run it out of the plant.

31:16.876 --> 31:17.877
Was that a yes or...?

31:18.503 --> 31:20.964
Sofia, please, join us.

31:21.047 --> 31:22.507
Oh, I didn't mean to interrupt.

31:27.345 --> 31:29.347
Oz, you remember
Carmine's daughter?

31:29.431 --> 31:30.348
Yeah.

31:31.016 --> 31:31.933
Sofia...

31:32.434 --> 31:34.310
I thought you were still at...

31:37.063 --> 31:38.940
-Arkham?
-Yeah.

31:40.442 --> 31:41.276
No.

31:42.902 --> 31:44.571
I've been rehabilitated.

31:46.740 --> 31:48.700
Have you asked him
about my brother?

31:50.201 --> 31:52.829
-I thought we agreed--
-Have you heard from Alberto?

31:53.538 --> 31:55.331
-Sofia, please...
-Al?

31:55.415 --> 31:57.542
He went out last night,
he refused his bodyguards,

31:57.625 --> 31:58.877
and he never came home.

31:58.960 --> 31:59.836
Sofia, that's enough.

32:01.838 --> 32:03.840
I better get out of your hair.

32:04.674 --> 32:06.301
You know, let you...

32:07.177 --> 32:09.012
So we can talk about this again?

32:09.596 --> 32:10.638
Shut it down.

32:11.264 --> 32:12.766
You have 48 hours.

32:15.310 --> 32:16.144
I'll get it done.

32:16.728 --> 32:18.897
You know, whatever...
whatever helps the Family.

32:20.607 --> 32:22.776
And it's good to see you.

32:33.411 --> 32:34.704
Fuckin' assholes.

32:37.916 --> 32:38.750
Oz.

32:39.459 --> 32:40.335
A moment.

32:41.419 --> 32:42.962
You never gave me an answer.

32:43.963 --> 32:45.256
Have you seen Alberto?

32:45.340 --> 32:46.174
Oh, yeah. Right.

32:46.257 --> 32:47.342
No. No.

32:47.425 --> 32:50.512
He's the boss now,
so he's a busy man.

32:51.096 --> 32:52.430
But I'm sure he's fine.

32:53.723 --> 32:55.058
They said the same thing.

32:55.141 --> 32:56.393
-Milos and Johnny?
-Mm-hmm.

32:56.476 --> 32:57.310
Well, they'd know.

33:00.730 --> 33:01.564
Well...

33:02.816 --> 33:03.817
Better get back to it.

33:05.068 --> 33:06.277
This is yours?

33:07.654 --> 33:09.572
This? Yeah.

33:11.825 --> 33:12.784
Purple.

33:14.077 --> 33:14.911
Very subtle.

33:14.994 --> 33:17.580
Well, technically, it's plum,
you know?

33:17.664 --> 33:19.499
Leather seats
come standard, too, so...

33:21.584 --> 33:23.878
You've really moved up
in the world, haven't you?

33:29.884 --> 33:30.969
What happened here?

33:33.054 --> 33:36.141
Punk kids tried to steal my rims
a few days back.

33:36.224 --> 33:37.559
I missed,
but they got the message.

33:39.394 --> 33:41.771
We're long overdue
for a catch-up, you and me.

33:43.148 --> 33:44.399
Let's get a bite to eat.

33:47.652 --> 33:48.945
-Right now?
-Right now.

33:50.363 --> 33:51.448
I know a place.

34:10.257 --> 34:12.177
Another dirty martini.
Three olives.

34:12.260 --> 34:13.511
You ready for another one?

34:13.636 --> 34:16.139
-You can make that two actually.
-Right away.

34:19.559 --> 34:22.353
It's a bit stuffy for my tastes.

34:22.437 --> 34:24.063
My father used to bring
me and Alberto here

34:24.147 --> 34:25.190
when we were kids.

34:28.068 --> 34:30.487
He paid us to keep our elbows
off the table.

34:32.364 --> 34:33.947
Well, who's stopping you now,
huh?

34:37.659 --> 34:38.578
There you go.

34:47.087 --> 34:49.089
You think they're wondering
if it's really me?

34:51.091 --> 34:51.966
Well, I would.

34:52.717 --> 34:56.221
What, is a psycho killer
just roaming around free,

34:56.304 --> 34:57.180
having a salad?

34:59.057 --> 35:00.308
What did the Gazette call me?

35:01.059 --> 35:02.185
The Hangman?

35:03.687 --> 35:05.772
The guards insisted
that I read every article,

35:05.855 --> 35:07.148
that I see all the stories.

35:08.066 --> 35:09.693
If only I'd been
a dutiful daughter.

35:15.407 --> 35:16.741
Are you nervous, Oz?

35:17.617 --> 35:18.493
Nervous?

35:20.412 --> 35:22.330
I'd hate for you
to feel nervous with me.

35:23.957 --> 35:26.292
'Cause despite what you
might think, I don't blame you.

35:26.376 --> 35:28.878
You know, if you hadn't gone
to my father...

35:30.505 --> 35:32.173
He left you no choice.

35:32.257 --> 35:35.260
Yeah, sure.
But I coulda done something--

35:35.343 --> 35:36.177
Let's not do that.

35:36.761 --> 35:37.846
Daddy is dead.

35:38.888 --> 35:40.015
And we are...

35:42.058 --> 35:43.226
untamed.

35:52.986 --> 35:55.280
Alberto told me he was going
to your club last night

35:55.363 --> 35:56.823
to get to my father's loft.

36:00.368 --> 36:03.329
I insisted I go with him, but...
he's been so protective of me.

36:03.413 --> 36:04.914
He didn't want me
leaving the house.

36:06.124 --> 36:09.210
It was all part of this plan
he cooked up.

36:09.294 --> 36:10.879
It was our shared secret.

36:11.546 --> 36:14.799
But then today, I hear you

36:14.883 --> 36:17.594
talking about revolutionizing
the drug business,

36:17.677 --> 36:19.137
and it just doesn't sit right.

36:20.930 --> 36:22.724
How do you know about his plan,

36:22.807 --> 36:25.977
and why on Earth
would you pitch it as your own?

36:28.813 --> 36:31.816
You know, it's so brazen

36:32.859 --> 36:36.363
that you either have to be
blindingly stupid

36:36.905 --> 36:38.156
or wildly confident

36:38.239 --> 36:40.909
that he isn't coming back
to reclaim it.

36:40.992 --> 36:43.036
So, I'm going to ask you again.

36:44.871 --> 36:46.414
Do you know where my brother is?

36:47.957 --> 36:49.125
Listen, Sofia...

36:53.421 --> 36:54.464
I'm an asshole.

36:56.299 --> 36:57.842
But you're the surprise here.

36:58.802 --> 36:59.928
Excuse me?

37:00.011 --> 37:01.763
Al never told me you was back...

37:02.764 --> 37:04.808
or that you were in on
this thing with us.

37:04.891 --> 37:07.268
Yeah, he's keeping us both
in the dark,

37:07.352 --> 37:08.395
and I don't know why.

37:09.562 --> 37:12.065
But you're right.
Alberto trusted me.

37:12.148 --> 37:14.859
And my stupid mouth...
You know, I screwed up.

37:16.194 --> 37:17.737
Maybe you could put in
a good word.

37:18.405 --> 37:20.573
I mean, I don't wanna
put that on you, but...

37:22.033 --> 37:23.827
He was so passionate
about his plan,

37:23.910 --> 37:25.954
I thought there's no reason
not to move forward,

37:26.037 --> 37:28.081
just 'cause he's
on another bender, you know?

37:28.164 --> 37:30.959
I mean, the shipment arrives
in a few days, right?

37:32.585 --> 37:33.878
What do you mean "a bender"?

37:37.882 --> 37:39.509
Al's an addict, sweetheart.

37:40.635 --> 37:42.095
He's got a penchant for Drops.

37:42.929 --> 37:44.514
And booze and gambling.

37:44.597 --> 37:46.224
I'm pretty sure
he's got a sex thing, too.

37:46.307 --> 37:48.643
So yeah, this ain't
the first time he's gone AWOL.

37:48.727 --> 37:50.103
But he always comes back.

37:51.021 --> 37:54.774
Look, if he was at my club,
I wouldn't know.

37:56.067 --> 37:57.402
I was actually
drowning my sorrows

37:57.485 --> 37:59.487
with my lady friend
last night, Eve.

38:02.282 --> 38:04.576
If it'll make you feel better,
let's you and me go there now.

38:04.659 --> 38:05.869
Come on. We'll scour the joint.

38:05.952 --> 38:08.496
I doubt anything will turn up,
but it's worth a shot.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.915
You know, whatever puts
your mind at ease.

38:15.879 --> 38:16.880
No, Oz, you're right.

38:19.257 --> 38:20.759
I'm probably just being crazy.

38:27.807 --> 38:29.309
Let's stay and enjoy the meal.

38:31.936 --> 38:33.938
I know I could use a good one.

38:34.022 --> 38:35.273
He'll turn up, Sofia.

38:36.608 --> 38:37.484
I'm sure of it.

38:40.028 --> 38:42.197
Thanks for lunch.
I'll get the next one.

38:46.701 --> 38:47.994
You know, Oz,

38:48.078 --> 38:49.829
people underestimate you,
but not me.

38:50.955 --> 38:53.041
I've always known
you were capable of more.

39:13.019 --> 39:14.104
Where are we going?

39:22.028 --> 39:25.448
Are-are we in trouble?

39:40.005 --> 39:42.298
Scan the code.
See Gotham's true face.

39:43.133 --> 39:45.093
-Scan the code?
-Get the fuck outta here.

39:47.137 --> 39:48.430
Irving Grove.

39:48.555 --> 39:50.015
Irving Grove Station.

39:51.725 --> 39:53.268
Irving Grove Station.

39:57.814 --> 39:58.857
This is yours?

40:00.150 --> 40:00.984
Get in.

40:42.150 --> 40:44.069
I ain't never taken
anyone here before.

40:44.736 --> 40:45.987
You say a word to anybody...

40:46.071 --> 40:47.113
You'll gut me like a fish.

40:47.197 --> 40:48.698
Yeah, till you bleed out
and die.

40:51.826 --> 40:54.079
Oh, and mind
your friggin' manners, too.

41:01.002 --> 41:01.836
Here.

41:03.421 --> 41:04.255
Don't move.

41:06.549 --> 41:07.801
What're you doing here?

41:07.884 --> 41:09.344
What do you mean
what am I doing here?

41:09.427 --> 41:10.428
I came to see you.

41:10.553 --> 41:11.888
Huh? Princess.

41:13.890 --> 41:16.601
-You look handsome.
-Thank you.

41:16.685 --> 41:18.937
-Put it on straight.
-Close your eyes.

41:19.020 --> 41:21.189
-I got you something. Come here.
-What did you do?

41:21.272 --> 41:22.440
I'll tell you when.

41:23.483 --> 41:26.027
Wha... Wait. What did you do?

41:26.111 --> 41:28.488
Okay, now look, keep 'em closed.

41:28.571 --> 41:29.989
-They're closed.
-All right.

41:31.866 --> 41:33.118
Open your eyes.

41:36.371 --> 41:38.748
Oswald, it's too much.

41:38.832 --> 41:41.251
-No.
-It's perfect.

41:41.334 --> 41:42.252
It suits ya, Ma.

41:44.587 --> 41:46.214
-Thank you, sweetheart.
-You're welcome.

41:46.339 --> 41:48.049
That's crazy.

41:48.133 --> 41:50.385
Wait, wait, wait.
Was I expecting you?

41:50.468 --> 41:52.012
-It's not Sunday, is it?
-No, it's--

41:52.095 --> 41:54.264
-I didn't get--
-Nah, nah.

41:54.347 --> 41:55.807
No, it's a special occasion.

41:55.890 --> 41:58.018
We're gonna... We're gonna
leave town for a while.

41:58.101 --> 42:00.520
Yeah. Take a little vacation.

42:00.603 --> 42:03.023
A vacation? To where?
You know I hate flying.

42:03.106 --> 42:04.315
Yeah. We're gonna drive.

42:04.983 --> 42:05.984
We're gonna drive?

42:06.067 --> 42:08.403
Who's gonna drive?
You gonna drive?

42:09.070 --> 42:10.530
-Ma?
-What?

42:10.613 --> 42:12.657
Why is this in the tub?
Your pills are ruined.

42:12.741 --> 42:14.325
No. I take 'em every morning
with breakfast.

42:14.409 --> 42:15.827
The tub is full.

42:15.910 --> 42:17.245
The boys were playing
in the bath.

42:17.328 --> 42:18.371
They didn't wanna get out.

42:22.917 --> 42:23.752
What?

42:23.835 --> 42:24.794
Oh, nothing.

42:25.545 --> 42:27.714
How about let's take your meds
right now, huh?

42:29.507 --> 42:30.592
Just to be sure.

42:33.136 --> 42:34.304
I took 'em.

42:34.429 --> 42:35.847
The pills are by the sink.

42:35.930 --> 42:37.223
Oswald!

42:37.807 --> 42:38.933
Someone's here.

42:39.017 --> 42:40.435
-Get out of my house!
-Hi. I'm...

42:40.518 --> 42:43.229
Who the hell is this?
Who the hell are you? What?

42:43.313 --> 42:45.357
-Shit! Ma, sorry. This is Vic.
-Get out!

42:45.440 --> 42:46.900
He's gonna help
take care of you.

42:47.400 --> 42:48.902
Just in case I need
to handle some things

42:48.985 --> 42:50.111
while we're gone. All right?

42:50.195 --> 42:52.405
-Huh. Vic?
-Yeah.

42:52.947 --> 42:55.241
-What is he, a nurse?
-Kinda.

42:55.325 --> 42:57.702
-No, I'm not--
-He's got nurse-like qualities.

42:57.786 --> 43:00.580
I'll explain more
in the car. All right?

43:07.253 --> 43:08.421
All right.

43:09.881 --> 43:10.924
Ma, here's your water.

43:11.049 --> 43:13.802
Take these two pills,
then we gotta go, okay?

43:14.969 --> 43:16.513
There you go, okay?

43:17.263 --> 43:20.016
Will you tell me first
what I did to lose your respect?

43:21.976 --> 43:23.770
-What are you talking about?
-You come in here,

43:23.853 --> 43:25.689
you're trying to buy me off
with a necklace?

43:26.189 --> 43:28.858
Some bullshit about
an urgent special occasion...

43:28.942 --> 43:29.776
Ma.

43:29.859 --> 43:31.736
Did I raise my sons
to lie to me?

43:31.820 --> 43:33.446
-Did I?
-No.

43:33.530 --> 43:35.907
So, then what did you do?
What did you do?

43:35.990 --> 43:37.534
Come on. What did you do?

43:39.994 --> 43:40.995
I...

43:42.497 --> 43:43.623
What did you do?

43:45.542 --> 43:46.501
I shot...

43:48.044 --> 43:49.629
Alberto Falcone.

43:51.089 --> 43:51.965
He's dead.

43:52.882 --> 43:55.260
It ain't safe for you here.
You understand?

43:55.885 --> 43:58.430
Sofia Falcone's out of Arkham,
and she knows.

43:59.806 --> 44:01.349
Or if she don't, she will.

44:01.433 --> 44:02.642
Why'd you shoot him? Why?

44:02.726 --> 44:05.145
Jesus, Ma, I ain't doing this
with you right now, okay?

44:09.357 --> 44:10.442
Fine.

44:12.652 --> 44:14.863
He fuckin' laughed at me.

44:15.947 --> 44:16.781
All right?

44:18.616 --> 44:20.660
-Now, can we go please?
-He laughed at you?

44:20.744 --> 44:23.163
It was impulsive. It was stupid.
Is that what you wanna hear?

44:23.246 --> 44:24.998
Jesus, I'm trying
to take care of you.

44:25.081 --> 44:26.291
-Stop.
-I can't risk it.

44:26.374 --> 44:27.709
I can't risk you.
I'm all you got.

44:27.792 --> 44:29.961
-If something happened to me--
-Stop! Stop talking!

44:31.671 --> 44:33.506
Do you hear the words
coming out of your mouth?

44:33.590 --> 44:35.050
-Yeah.
-How weak they sound?

44:36.676 --> 44:37.969
Like a little pussy boy?

44:39.929 --> 44:40.805
Look at me.

44:41.514 --> 44:42.932
Is that what you are, Oswald?

44:43.933 --> 44:45.560
Weak little pussy boy?

44:45.643 --> 44:46.478
No.

44:48.646 --> 44:49.481
That's right.

44:50.940 --> 44:52.233
'Cause you're mine.

44:52.734 --> 44:54.819
You're my big, strong bull
of a boy.

44:54.903 --> 44:56.321
You never forget that.

44:59.074 --> 45:00.158
Come here.

45:07.749 --> 45:09.125
Don't you see, dear?

45:09.876 --> 45:11.670
What you did wasn't impulsive.

45:12.337 --> 45:13.546
It was instinctual.

45:14.673 --> 45:17.092
You shot that junkie piss-ant

45:17.175 --> 45:18.843
because you wanted to.

45:20.595 --> 45:21.596
Just like that.

45:23.848 --> 45:25.850
Oh, you're so close now
to having

45:25.934 --> 45:27.936
everything you ever wanted,
everything you deserve.

45:28.019 --> 45:30.188
You wanna run? You wanna hide?

45:30.271 --> 45:32.065
No.

45:32.649 --> 45:34.776
This city is meant
to be yours, sweetheart.

45:38.321 --> 45:39.823
What are you gonna do to get it?

45:50.917 --> 45:54.504
Put the blame on Mame, boys

45:55.130 --> 45:57.757
Put the blame on Mame

46:00.802 --> 46:05.390
They once had a shootin'
up in the Klondike

46:05.473 --> 46:08.351
When they got Dan McGrew

46:09.394 --> 46:13.773
Folks were putting the blame on

46:13.857 --> 46:17.444
The lady known as Lou

46:18.695 --> 46:21.072
That's the story
that went around

46:21.156 --> 46:22.490
God damn it, this chick.

46:22.574 --> 46:25.285
But here's the real lowdown

46:27.037 --> 46:30.248
Put the blame on Mame, boys...

46:31.458 --> 46:32.500
Who's Mame?

46:34.252 --> 46:35.253
It don't matter, kid.

46:36.463 --> 46:37.547
That's the thing.

46:38.923 --> 46:40.383
She's just a scapegoat.

46:40.467 --> 46:43.678
That's the thing
that slew McGrew

46:44.512 --> 46:48.224
So you can put the blame
on Mame, boys

46:48.308 --> 46:51.895
Put the blame

46:51.978 --> 46:57.484
On Mame

47:00.862 --> 47:03.156
Listen, it ain't easy,
but your part in this...

47:03.740 --> 47:04.908
it's the most important.

47:05.533 --> 47:07.160
So don't say you're good
unless you are.

47:09.496 --> 47:11.498
I don't know, Oz.
I don't know if I'm...

47:13.625 --> 47:16.795
I've-I've n-never done
anything like this.

47:21.925 --> 47:23.134
Listen, Vic...

47:24.260 --> 47:25.637
the tenement where you live...

47:27.013 --> 47:28.181
I know it's gone.

47:28.890 --> 47:30.642
Nothing on Sixth
was left standing.

47:30.725 --> 47:34.229
I don't know if you had family
or people in there...

47:36.231 --> 47:37.232
but you made it.

47:37.816 --> 47:39.192
You're standing right here.

47:40.318 --> 47:41.403
I've been where you are.

47:41.903 --> 47:43.238
And you heard my ma.

47:43.321 --> 47:44.698
I mean, this...

47:44.781 --> 47:47.450
this is one of those moments
where you gotta ask yourself...

47:48.034 --> 47:49.244
what kind of life do I want?

47:50.120 --> 47:52.497
You wanna spend your days
thinking small, stealing rims,

47:52.580 --> 47:53.748
barely getting by?

47:54.749 --> 47:56.167
Or do you want more
for yourself?

47:57.752 --> 47:59.379
You saw how the Falcones live.

48:00.130 --> 48:02.590
Can you imagine
living like that? Huh?

48:02.674 --> 48:06.219
In a mansion,
maids and butlers and shit?

48:06.302 --> 48:07.595
They don't even know
what they got,

48:07.679 --> 48:08.888
'cause they always had it.

48:10.181 --> 48:11.182
Never hungry.

48:11.933 --> 48:12.892
Born full.

48:14.602 --> 48:15.437
Not us.

48:18.189 --> 48:20.525
The world wasn't built
for guys like us.

48:21.693 --> 48:24.195
That's why we gotta take
whatever we decide is ours.

48:25.238 --> 48:27.949
'Cause no one's gonna give it
to us, not without a fight.

48:30.410 --> 48:31.619
Now, I coulda killed you.

48:32.203 --> 48:33.955
I coulda put you
out of your misery,

48:34.039 --> 48:34.956
but I didn't,

48:35.040 --> 48:36.750
'cause you need
a guy like me, Vic.

48:37.876 --> 48:38.877
But I gotta know.

48:40.795 --> 48:41.713
No bullshit.

48:43.965 --> 48:45.508
Can I count on you
to pull through?

48:48.720 --> 48:49.554
Yeah, I...

48:50.180 --> 48:51.139
I can do it.

48:53.475 --> 48:54.642
I can do it.

48:57.937 --> 48:59.064
I know you can.

49:00.648 --> 49:03.109
What do you think? I hire
any schmuck off the street? No.

49:06.905 --> 49:09.032
All right, go ahead.
Get outta here.

49:09.657 --> 49:10.492
Keep your phone on.

49:48.154 --> 49:48.988
Sal.

49:50.156 --> 49:51.449
That's not my table.

50:05.630 --> 50:07.632
Listen, Sal, I'm here
to make things right.

50:08.800 --> 50:10.468
I'm done with the Falcones.

50:10.552 --> 50:13.138
I wanna offer my services
to you and your family.

50:13.221 --> 50:15.807
Well, that surprises me, Oz.
Really does.

50:16.558 --> 50:19.352
'Cause I thought you liked
eating outta Falcone's ass.

50:20.145 --> 50:21.938
Oh, you wanna throw stones?

50:22.939 --> 50:23.773
Fine.

50:24.774 --> 50:25.900
But from where I sit,

50:26.484 --> 50:27.694
and where you sit,

50:28.486 --> 50:29.779
I don't think
you're in a position

50:29.863 --> 50:30.989
not to hear me out.

50:31.614 --> 50:32.699
Way I see it,

50:32.782 --> 50:35.326
the Falcone higher-ups are
a bunch of old men who don't...

50:35.410 --> 50:36.453
No disrespect.

50:36.536 --> 50:37.787
...who don't remember
what it's like

50:37.871 --> 50:39.039
to get their hands dirty.

50:39.122 --> 50:41.249
That's what they hire
guys like me for,

50:41.332 --> 50:43.501
which means I got direct access
to the ground game.

50:44.044 --> 50:46.880
I'm talking the Drops,
the dealers, the chemists,

50:46.963 --> 50:48.006
the whole thing.

50:48.965 --> 50:49.924
Next couple of days,

50:50.050 --> 50:52.802
the Falcones are gonna do
something real stupid,

50:52.886 --> 50:54.721
shut down the biggest
Drops operation they got...

50:54.804 --> 50:56.264
I'm talking millions
of dollars' worth.

50:56.348 --> 50:58.391
...and move to some bumfuck part
of Gotham,

50:59.017 --> 51:00.602
which means a huge chunk
of their business

51:00.685 --> 51:01.895
will be ripe for the taking.

51:03.271 --> 51:04.939
And guess
who's in charge of the move.

51:05.815 --> 51:07.442
I could give you
everything you need.

51:07.525 --> 51:10.820
So your crew could just swoop in
and steal the whole fucking kit.

51:10.904 --> 51:11.946
I play victim.

51:12.781 --> 51:14.199
We split the payday.

51:14.783 --> 51:16.284
You make it sound so simple.

51:17.452 --> 51:19.788
But it's my guys
doing all the heavy lifting.

51:19.871 --> 51:21.831
Yeah, revenge don't come easy.

51:23.041 --> 51:24.292
Come on, Sal.

51:25.543 --> 51:27.337
Don't you fucking miss it?

51:29.589 --> 51:30.423
Respect?

51:32.050 --> 51:34.344
That's really what Carmine stole
from you, ain't it?

51:36.096 --> 51:37.472
He was a dirty rat.

51:38.515 --> 51:40.058
He played us both for fools.

51:40.892 --> 51:42.227
Ain't no changing that.

51:44.354 --> 51:45.355
But he's dead,

51:46.231 --> 51:47.482
and I'm here now,

51:47.565 --> 51:49.526
and I'm offering you
the opportunity of a lifetime.

51:49.609 --> 51:52.028
And this first hit,
it's just the beginning.

51:52.654 --> 51:54.489
I know a lot more
than people think.

51:55.448 --> 51:57.075
I'll keep playing double agent.

51:58.201 --> 51:59.035
You and me,

52:00.495 --> 52:02.080
we can tear down
their fucking empire

52:02.163 --> 52:03.123
from the inside out.

52:07.460 --> 52:09.838
What is it
you're really after, Oz?

52:09.921 --> 52:12.007
I just told you what I'm after.
What do you mean?

52:12.090 --> 52:14.718
I know who you are.
I know what you are.

52:15.343 --> 52:18.221
I don't work with people
whose loyalty is for sale.

52:18.805 --> 52:21.683
You think I forgot all the times
you schmoozed me and my boys

52:21.725 --> 52:23.268
just to turn around and fuck us?

52:23.309 --> 52:24.519
Thought I forgot that?

52:25.979 --> 52:28.565
Huge drug bust does down
right under your nose,

52:28.648 --> 52:30.191
and you got nothing
to do with it?

52:31.401 --> 52:32.485
The fuck outta here.

52:35.780 --> 52:37.907
Look, I can see you're upset.

52:38.533 --> 52:39.784
Trust takes time.

52:40.785 --> 52:42.037
But this ain't bullshit.

52:43.163 --> 52:45.665
Whoever controls Drops
controls the streets.

52:45.749 --> 52:46.875
You know that's right.

52:49.085 --> 52:50.003
So how about this?

52:50.795 --> 52:52.088
I'll come back
in a couple of days...

52:52.172 --> 52:54.507
I never wanna see
your smug face again.

52:54.591 --> 52:56.384
...we'll see
if we can't work something out.

52:57.677 --> 52:59.054
It's good seeing you.
You look good.

52:59.929 --> 53:01.348
-Fuck off.
-Think on it, Sal.

53:05.185 --> 53:06.186
I almost forgot.

53:11.608 --> 53:12.776
Ain't this yours?

53:17.447 --> 53:18.782
Where did you get this?

53:18.865 --> 53:20.575
Carmine. Wore it as his own.

53:22.869 --> 53:23.912
The Falcones...

53:25.497 --> 53:27.499
they been flaunting
what they done to you for years.

53:27.582 --> 53:29.459
But how is it that you have it?

53:31.961 --> 53:33.546
Maybe I'm more
than what you think.

53:43.848 --> 53:46.101
What up? It's Victor.
Leave a message.

53:46.184 --> 53:47.060
Fuck!

54:02.909 --> 54:03.993
Nobody home.

54:08.498 --> 54:09.416
Shit!

54:13.586 --> 54:14.671
Go.

54:16.840 --> 54:18.508
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

54:32.814 --> 54:35.150
Come on, Vic. Shit, shit, shit.

54:35.233 --> 54:36.609
What up? It's Victor.

54:36.693 --> 54:37.694
-Shit!
-Leave a message.

54:38.278 --> 54:39.571
Damn it, Vic!

54:56.004 --> 54:56.838
Fuck!

55:06.222 --> 55:07.098
Let's go.

55:13.063 --> 55:14.731
Go. Go, go. Let's go.

55:36.711 --> 55:37.962
Get the fuck out!

55:42.759 --> 55:44.678
Come here!

55:44.761 --> 55:45.929
I'll fucking...

56:13.331 --> 56:14.165
Fuck.

56:16.376 --> 56:19.879
It's a terrible feeling.
Isn't it?

56:21.631 --> 56:23.550
Nothing left to hide behind.

56:24.426 --> 56:27.303
The guards at Arkham
stripped us bare every morning.

56:29.848 --> 56:31.349
It was humiliating...

56:32.559 --> 56:34.019
being turned into a thing.

56:36.563 --> 56:38.857
But after a while, I just
started to think, "Well...

56:39.566 --> 56:42.694
...what's it matter?
There's nothing left anyway."

56:44.487 --> 56:45.655
But my brother?

56:45.739 --> 56:47.866
My brother
visited me every week.

56:49.117 --> 56:52.454
And every week, he said
that there was something left,

56:53.246 --> 56:57.417
and that he was gonna
help me fight to keep it.

56:58.752 --> 57:01.796
I just wonder
how you see me, Oz.

57:03.173 --> 57:08.136
If I am more
than a thing to play with.

57:11.890 --> 57:16.144
You were right, though,
about the club and the loft.

57:16.853 --> 57:17.729
That was all clean.

57:18.897 --> 57:19.898
But outside...

57:21.149 --> 57:22.108
Well...

57:22.984 --> 57:26.613
The downside
of driving a plum car

57:27.447 --> 57:29.407
is that it's very hard
to forget.

57:30.825 --> 57:32.035
And so are you

57:32.118 --> 57:35.246
when you shoot at a bunch
of kids in the street.

57:35.330 --> 57:36.456
And this one...

57:37.123 --> 57:38.708
says it all happened...

57:40.627 --> 57:43.213
the night Alberto went missing.

57:46.174 --> 57:47.050
I don't know.

57:48.885 --> 57:49.803
What do you say?

57:52.555 --> 57:53.890
You think I know this kid?

57:54.724 --> 57:55.809
I don't know this kid.

57:57.185 --> 57:59.145
You can't take
some teenager's word over mine.

57:59.229 --> 58:00.897
So you're saying
that he's the liar?

58:01.815 --> 58:03.650
-Yes!
-Not you?

58:03.733 --> 58:05.485
Yes! Fucking yes!

58:05.568 --> 58:06.778
Okay.

58:06.861 --> 58:08.029
Hey, no. I--

58:14.327 --> 58:17.080
That's what you wanted, right?

58:17.664 --> 58:20.333
To have my reputation
precede me?

58:20.875 --> 58:22.252
You are so good

58:22.335 --> 58:24.254
at talking your way
out of things.

58:24.337 --> 58:28.049
Even at the cost
of someone else's life.

58:28.883 --> 58:30.093
Especially then.

58:30.677 --> 58:31.594
Right?

58:33.096 --> 58:35.223
The fuck you doing?
What are you doing?!

58:35.306 --> 58:37.142
But my father
isn't around anymore

58:37.892 --> 58:39.102
to reward you

58:39.853 --> 58:43.064
with fancy suits,
and stupid cars...

58:43.148 --> 58:44.065
Sofia.

58:44.149 --> 58:47.152
...and a club that he lets
you believe is yours.

58:48.069 --> 58:49.446
Sofia--

58:53.033 --> 58:55.035
It's just you and me now, okay?

58:55.910 --> 58:59.205
So I want you to think.
I want you to really think.

59:01.833 --> 59:02.792
Am I crazy?

59:05.420 --> 59:06.463
Is it all in my head?

59:09.966 --> 59:11.384
Tell me. Tell me.

59:12.218 --> 59:14.554
Tell me that I'm...
that I'm too emotional,

59:14.637 --> 59:17.640
and that I have
an overactive imagination,

59:17.724 --> 59:24.564
and that I shouldn't take things
so personally.

59:29.235 --> 59:30.236
But first...

59:33.406 --> 59:34.657
tell me he's alive.

01:00:02.102 --> 01:00:03.436
Miss Falcone, please.

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:08.066
What the fuck is this?

01:00:54.863 --> 01:00:55.739
Oh, shit!

01:01:37.489 --> 01:01:38.656
You did good today, kid.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.078
Thanks.

01:01:43.661 --> 01:01:44.788
So, I gotta ask.

01:01:46.081 --> 01:01:46.915
What happened?

01:01:48.333 --> 01:01:50.168
I mean, we made a plan.
You were there.

01:01:51.211 --> 01:01:52.337
Didn't we agree

01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:54.255
the head alone
would be the most poetic,

01:01:54.339 --> 01:01:55.924
and the pinky,
the cherry on top?

01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:58.259
But instead,
the whole body's in there.

01:01:58.385 --> 01:01:59.427
Just a pinky chopped off.

01:01:59.511 --> 01:02:00.929
It felt...

01:02:02.097 --> 01:02:03.515
well, small.

01:02:03.598 --> 01:02:07.769
Yeah, right. No, I--
Look, I-I-I wanted to, right?

01:02:07.852 --> 01:02:09.479
And I th-thought that I could,
but...

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.023
When I got to it,
and I'm thinking,

01:02:12.691 --> 01:02:16.027
"Do I... Do I start at the front
and then hit the trachea?"

01:02:16.111 --> 01:02:17.404
But then
when I got to his throat,

01:02:17.487 --> 01:02:19.155
I started thinking,
"Do I cut from the back?"

01:02:19.239 --> 01:02:20.990
And then I'm imagining
the spine and...

01:02:21.074 --> 01:02:22.409
All right, all right, all right.

01:02:22.492 --> 01:02:23.660
You know what? It's fine.

01:02:24.285 --> 01:02:25.328
Room to grow.

01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:27.497
Yeah. At least Sofia
got the message.

01:02:28.039 --> 01:02:29.958
With Sal wearing that ring
around Blackgate,

01:02:30.041 --> 01:02:32.043
Maronis ain't got no choice
but to take credit.

01:02:32.502 --> 01:02:33.670
That's what matters.

01:02:34.337 --> 01:02:36.214
Wait. S-Sal doesn't know?

01:02:37.215 --> 01:02:38.967
I thought that
the whole th-thing we--

01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:40.343
Jesus, Vic, relax.

01:02:41.469 --> 01:02:43.013
We just put the Maronis
back on the map.

01:02:43.096 --> 01:02:46.141
If Sal's got a problem
with that, then... fuck him.

01:02:46.224 --> 01:02:47.350
I don't need him.

01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:48.977
I don't need any of 'em.

01:02:50.437 --> 01:02:53.356
From here on out,
there's no more playing it safe.

01:02:54.774 --> 01:02:56.276
Drops are yesterday's game.

01:02:57.694 --> 01:02:59.779
I'm gonna get whatever the hell
is in that shipment.

01:03:00.947 --> 01:03:02.615
I'm gonna run this goddamn city.

01:03:04.784 --> 01:03:05.910
And I want you in on it.

01:03:08.163 --> 01:03:08.997
Really?

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.957
Yeah. You earned it.

01:03:11.833 --> 01:03:13.877
You know, for the most part.

01:03:14.502 --> 01:03:16.755
And guys like us,
we gotta stick together.

01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:24.095
It's better, right? Come on.

01:03:24.179 --> 01:03:25.347
When you mix the flavors?

01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:28.058
Yeah, it's good.

01:03:28.141 --> 01:03:29.893
No. It's not just good.
It's better.

01:03:29.976 --> 01:03:31.102
It's the fucking best.
