00:59.590 --> 01:03.220
I bet you got a lot of questions rattling around in your head.

01:03.330 --> 01:06.690
- How much money in the case? - Anywhere between 350 and half a mil.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.420
- And how much do you need, Val? - We split it 50-50.

01:09.530 --> 01:10.930
- How much? - 130 grand.

01:11.030 --> 01:12.675
- We'll hit them on Friday. - It's not enough.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.780
- And how much do you need, Val? - We split it 50-50.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.600
- It's my money. - Yeah, well, I'm up short.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.200
My 70 grand, I want it back.

01:18.310 --> 01:19.500
- 60 short. - 70.

01:20.110 --> 01:22.870
70, Val. It's 70 grand. 70, you dumb bastards.

01:47.470 --> 01:48.530
Help the homeless.

01:51.940 --> 01:53.410
Help the homeless.

01:56.110 --> 01:59.140
That's small change. Why don't you give me some big change?

01:59.650 --> 02:01.640
Give a guy a break. What do you say?

02:01.750 --> 02:02.980
Come on, now.

02:04.220 --> 02:06.750
Thanks, man... Hey, what the fuck!

02:06.860 --> 02:08.590
What are you...

02:13.330 --> 02:15.190
Son of a... Motherfucker!

02:20.800 --> 02:23.500
- What do I owe you? - $2.98.

02:42.060 --> 02:45.050
Son of a... Hey! Hey, my cigarettes!

03:17.130 --> 03:19.650
Sorry, sir. Pardon me.

03:55.330 --> 03:56.560
Thank you.

04:01.770 --> 04:05.330
$100, $200, $300.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.110
Have a nice day, Mr. Johnson.

04:08.940 --> 04:10.640
Excellent fit, sir.

04:11.280 --> 04:13.150
And how will you be paying?

04:39.480 --> 04:41.100
Yeah, I'll give you $900 for this.

04:41.210 --> 04:42.800
Let me see that Magnum.

04:46.980 --> 04:48.040
That's it.

05:14.540 --> 05:16.030
$500 and the gun.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.680
- I'll need to see some ID. - Of course.

05:36.730 --> 05:39.530
I'm sorry, Mr. Johnson. This card's been canceled.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.600
Impossible.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.300
Well, I tried it twice.

05:43.410 --> 05:46.270
- Do you have another form of payment? - Try it again.

07:34.350 --> 07:37.480
Porter, you're not dead.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.590
Where's Val?

07:50.500 --> 07:52.020
Gone. Moved out two months ago.

07:52.130 --> 07:53.860
- Where? - Don't know.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.560
- Who's paying your rent? - Val.

07:59.170 --> 08:01.570
- Why? - Payoff, I guess.

08:02.680 --> 08:04.740
What, you guess? You don't know?

08:19.430 --> 08:22.920
Damn it! You've got a fucking lot of nerve coming around here

08:23.030 --> 08:26.430
all fucking high and mighty. What, you bring your whore with you, did you?

08:36.809 --> 08:38.909
- No, no, no. - Look at it!

08:39.010 --> 08:42.950
Look, see. Look at that. That's before we met, baby.

08:44.090 --> 08:45.350
Think about it.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.530
Oh, God.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.430
Oh, God.

09:12.550 --> 09:16.210
- So, what are you gonna do, Porter? - I'm gonna get my money back.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.090
You mean, what am I gonna do to you.

09:28.530 --> 09:30.230
Well, that depends on you.

09:30.730 --> 09:31.860
Where's Val?

09:34.070 --> 09:35.760
I told you, I don't know.

09:39.610 --> 09:42.810
Did he ever buy his way back into the syndicate?

09:44.950 --> 09:46.040
Yeah.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.280
How do you get your payoffs?

09:51.720 --> 09:56.420
A messenger, first of every month, leaves an envelope with cash in it.

10:04.970 --> 10:09.200
So, who was she, anyway? That girl in the picture.

10:10.940 --> 10:13.070
I met her when I got out of prison.

10:13.910 --> 10:17.350
I used to drive her, keep her safe while she worked.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.180
What were you, her pimp?

10:23.050 --> 10:24.850
Nerd.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.250
We both worked for that asshole.

11:27.250 --> 11:28.480
Not now.

11:30.320 --> 11:31.450
Yeah.

11:32.850 --> 11:34.290
You're cleaning up.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.130
No.

14:00.900 --> 14:02.870
Val still wants to talk to you.

14:06.440 --> 14:07.570
Sorry, babe.

14:09.610 --> 14:12.100
Shall I tell him to call back again?

14:12.880 --> 14:14.410
No, I'll talk to him.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.580
Shut him up, anyway.

14:19.760 --> 14:20.780
Val.

14:22.460 --> 14:24.930
Yeah, same as always. You?

14:25.360 --> 14:26.760
Yeah, good, good.

14:28.460 --> 14:30.060
Why? You there now?

14:33.870 --> 14:36.770
Well, don't sweat it, Val. I mean, we all look alike to them.

14:39.210 --> 14:41.070
Same crew. The Chows.

14:41.310 --> 14:43.170
Twice a week, Tuesday and Friday.

14:43.280 --> 14:46.270
Always between 11:00 and 12:00, always the same route.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.180
Chinese money laundering.

14:52.450 --> 14:57.220
- How much money in the case? - Anywhere between 350 and half a mil.

15:02.500 --> 15:06.630
- And how much do you need, Val? - We split it 50-50.

15:07.570 --> 15:11.160
No, I mean, how much do you need to, you know, buy your way back?

15:15.280 --> 15:18.540
Into the syndicate. How much?

15:19.310 --> 15:20.910
- You mean the outfit? - Whatever.

15:21.020 --> 15:23.080
Jesus, you know everything.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.990
Hi, sweetie.

15:27.690 --> 15:29.120
130 grand.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.060
The beauty of the Chows is they won't go to the cops.

15:40.170 --> 15:44.470
They keep everything in-house, and they don't feel pain the way we do.

15:44.940 --> 15:46.910
You notice anything about those guys, Val?

15:47.010 --> 15:48.370
They look nasty.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.600
Probably all kung fu motherfuckers.

15:50.880 --> 15:54.510
- Why? Did I miss something? - They weren't wearing their seat belts.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.780
We'll hit them on Friday.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.430
Hubba, hubba, hubba.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.920
Looky here.

17:12.460 --> 17:14.359
How's that vinyl taste?

17:28.740 --> 17:29.770
Val!

17:30.510 --> 17:31.480
What?

17:47.230 --> 17:48.870
The problem with kicking the Chows' asses,

17:48.960 --> 17:51.230
an hour later you wanna do it again.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.050
140 grand.

18:10.650 --> 18:11.980
140 apiece.

18:13.220 --> 18:14.350
Total.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.150
Total?

18:20.800 --> 18:23.130
That's... That's what? That's 70 grand?

18:23.530 --> 18:25.290
- That's not enough. - It is for me.

18:25.400 --> 18:28.030
I'm taking the next few months off. Here's the bag, baby.

18:28.140 --> 18:29.730
Yeah, well, I'm up short.

18:29.840 --> 18:33.000
60 short. Fucking slants!

18:33.140 --> 18:35.940
Should've hit them Tuesday. Fuck!

18:37.810 --> 18:41.810
We got away clean and got something to show for it.

18:42.880 --> 18:46.290
Always be grateful for what you get. Rule number one, Val.

18:47.790 --> 18:48.880
Yeah.

18:49.620 --> 18:51.460
Yeah. Rule number one.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.300
What?

19:10.210 --> 19:11.840
Everything's cool.

19:13.150 --> 19:15.450
It's just not enough, all right?

19:15.820 --> 19:17.220
It never is, Val.

19:18.320 --> 19:21.150
Hey, baby, just put the money in the car, will you?

19:30.400 --> 19:32.000
I can't fucking believe it. We should...

19:32.025 --> 19:34.785
You know... You know what? You know what, Porter?

19:36.700 --> 19:39.260
This is funny. This'll kill you.

19:42.110 --> 19:43.810
It's always $140,000.

19:50.120 --> 19:52.280
Someone ought to give me a Ph.D.

19:53.090 --> 19:54.150
You...

19:55.660 --> 19:56.890
Shit!

19:57.760 --> 20:00.560
Jesus, Lynn, wait till I'm out of the fucking way!

20:11.070 --> 20:13.870
Okay, everything's cool, baby.

20:23.380 --> 20:25.380
You were great. You were great.

20:25.490 --> 20:27.610
Everything's cool. Give me the... Okay.

20:27.720 --> 20:29.420
Okay, okay, keep the gun.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.820
That's it. Everything's cool.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.320
Just like we planned. Come on.

20:35.430 --> 20:37.330
Don't fall apart on me now.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.000
There we go.

20:51.210 --> 20:55.170
I bet you got a lot of questions rattling around in your head.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.320
I don't know, pally.

21:02.420 --> 21:05.980
I guess wives get funny when it comes to girlfriends?

21:08.960 --> 21:10.020
What?

21:11.600 --> 21:12.960
I didn't get that.

21:14.570 --> 21:15.900
You got it.

21:51.610 --> 21:54.130
Come on, Miss Porter, I don't have all day!

22:14.060 --> 22:17.330
Is... Is Miss Porter here?

22:18.630 --> 22:19.860
Mrs. Porter.

22:23.740 --> 22:25.000
Yeah, whatever.

22:28.540 --> 22:30.480
You motherfucker!

22:33.820 --> 22:35.280
Get up, turn around.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.310
Come on. Get up. Come on.

22:42.490 --> 22:44.890
What have we got here?

22:46.860 --> 22:49.920
- How much in here? - There's two grand.

22:50.030 --> 22:51.290
What's in here?

22:51.400 --> 22:53.920
Helium. What the fuck you think it is? It's heroin.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.200
Oh, fuck!

23:02.840 --> 23:04.900
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

23:05.410 --> 23:06.470
Fuck!

23:07.480 --> 23:08.850
Val Resnick.

23:10.290 --> 23:11.720
Where is he?

23:12.550 --> 23:14.420
You wanna know where he is?

23:15.560 --> 23:19.080
He's right here. Look. Look. Fuck you.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.680
Wrong answer.

23:22.260 --> 23:24.660
Shit! You motherfucker!

23:25.200 --> 23:27.530
- Fuck! - Val Resnick.

23:29.100 --> 23:31.500
I never heard of him, man. Fuck.

23:31.610 --> 23:34.040
Where'd you get the envelope and the shit?

23:34.640 --> 23:36.360
Come on, man, they're gonna fucking kill me.

23:36.410 --> 23:38.170
They're gonna kill me, man.

23:42.150 --> 23:44.120
What do you think I'm gonna do?

23:44.290 --> 23:45.550
Worry about me.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.190
Oh, come on. Okay.

23:48.290 --> 23:49.980
Okay, okay, okay.

23:50.360 --> 23:53.590
Stegman... Stegman, man. Arthur fucking Stegman. Okay?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.360
Where is he?

23:56.960 --> 23:58.560
Southend Taxi.

23:59.270 --> 24:01.170
Farragut Road, man.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.270
Thanks.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.400
You're welcome.

24:32.830 --> 24:34.800
I'm looking for Arthur Stegman.

24:35.070 --> 24:37.590
He ain't here. Something I can help you with?

24:38.370 --> 24:40.710
No, you can't. Where is he?

24:41.680 --> 24:43.470
I don't know. He ain't here.

24:45.750 --> 24:46.910
Take a guess.

24:47.950 --> 24:49.010
What?

24:51.420 --> 24:53.390
Take a guess about where he is.

25:03.560 --> 25:04.830
Is he at home?

25:09.070 --> 25:11.040
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

25:14.180 --> 25:15.510
All right, here we go.

25:15.610 --> 25:17.130
Hey, come on, roll it!

25:17.710 --> 25:20.550
- Wait a minute. That was mine! - It was not yours, man.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.010
I get one more shot.

25:27.220 --> 25:29.280
There's somebody here to see you.

25:33.690 --> 25:35.360
I'm looking for Stegman.

25:40.330 --> 25:41.820
Who the hell are you?

25:42.470 --> 25:43.530
I'm Porter.

25:44.710 --> 25:48.370
Well, Porter, that looks like assault to me.

25:51.180 --> 25:54.480
Porter looks to me like the kind that likes to resist arrest.

25:57.590 --> 25:58.640
Hey!

25:58.750 --> 25:59.880
Fuck, no! Not in here.

25:59.990 --> 26:02.250
Jesus, guys, he just... He wants to talk.

26:02.860 --> 26:04.980
Am I right? Did I call it?

26:08.960 --> 26:10.520
Are you Stegman?

26:12.130 --> 26:14.600
Maybe. What do you want?

26:16.300 --> 26:18.400
Your boy didn't make his delivery.

26:19.740 --> 26:20.730
Jesus.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.740
Artie.

26:22.840 --> 26:25.440
Hey, listen, don't worry about it. Why don't we talk outside?

26:25.550 --> 26:27.140
Artie, you're a dealer?

26:27.780 --> 26:30.080
Just forget about it, all right?

26:30.550 --> 26:32.780
And don't touch my money, either.

26:32.950 --> 26:35.050
- Come on. Let's... - This is heroin?

26:37.190 --> 26:39.820
- This is heroin. - Guys, just...

26:39.930 --> 26:43.830
Don't worry about it, all right? Just take it easy. Let's talk. Come on.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.720
What are you guys looking at? Play your game.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.740
And you're bleeding all over my couch. Come on, you. Come on.

26:57.810 --> 26:59.870
Steggie's been holding out on us.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.750
I'll check it out.

27:04.050 --> 27:05.180
Val Resnick.

27:07.920 --> 27:10.080
- What about him? - You're gonna tell me where he is.

27:10.190 --> 27:13.180
No. No. Even if I knew, the answer would still be no.

27:13.290 --> 27:15.520
Now, where'd you meet up with my delivery boy?

27:15.630 --> 27:16.650
At his drop.

27:16.760 --> 27:17.860
Is he dead?

27:17.970 --> 27:21.160
No, but she is. OD'd on that crap you've been sending her.

27:21.970 --> 27:22.960
So?

27:23.400 --> 27:25.900
- What do you care? - I'm her husband.

27:27.910 --> 27:30.340
You're not gonna fucking kill me, are you?

27:33.280 --> 27:35.010
Not in front of these kids.

27:37.020 --> 27:38.380
Where is he?

27:42.890 --> 27:44.290
I don't know.

27:44.590 --> 27:45.620
That's the truth.

27:45.730 --> 27:48.410
You see, this stuff gets delivered to me, too, you know. Last night.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.020
And I won't see anyone again till next month.

27:52.900 --> 27:54.370
Why all the trouble?

27:54.570 --> 27:56.760
Well, he's afraid of the girl.

27:56.870 --> 28:00.640
You know, I mean, of... Of Mrs. Porter.

28:04.210 --> 28:06.700
Look, I don't know nothing about this, okay?

28:06.810 --> 28:08.610
I know Val from the old days.

28:08.720 --> 28:11.650
Three months ago he shows up, asks me to do him a favor.

28:11.750 --> 28:15.090
I make an extra grand a month, so I figure, what the hell, right?

28:15.190 --> 28:17.120
Now you come around threatening to kill me?

28:17.220 --> 28:19.950
Believe me, that much a buddy of Val's, I am not.

28:20.360 --> 28:22.390
He's in the city. That's it. That's all I know.

28:22.500 --> 28:25.470
- I got a game going on in here. - How do you know that?

28:25.770 --> 28:26.790
He said so.

28:26.900 --> 28:28.960
- When? - When he... Then.

28:29.070 --> 28:30.060
When he came around.

28:30.170 --> 28:32.260
Said that he squared himself with the syndicate.

28:32.370 --> 28:34.140
Said he was back in the big time.

28:34.240 --> 28:36.640
Back for good. He was very excited.

28:36.740 --> 28:39.540
Well, you tell him that Porter is back, too,

28:40.380 --> 28:42.610
and he wants his money, Porter wants his money.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.360
Or I'll come back here and pay you a visit

28:44.385 --> 28:46.745
- when these kids are not around. - Well...

28:49.460 --> 28:50.950
When would I tell him this?

29:12.880 --> 29:14.210
Talk to me.

29:14.450 --> 29:17.940
There's a young lady to see you, sir. Her name is Pearl.

29:18.190 --> 29:20.350
She's got two very bad habits.

29:20.450 --> 29:23.420
Right now, I'm only interested in one of them.

29:24.190 --> 29:25.560
Send her up.

29:28.800 --> 29:31.820
Apartment 718, ma'am. Go right on up.

29:51.720 --> 29:54.450
- Send her up. What's the problem? - Hey, Val, it's Haskell.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.480
Sorry to be calling you at home, but I thought...

29:56.505 --> 29:58.690
Don't be sorry, sweetie. Just don't call.

29:58.790 --> 30:00.520
Well, I thought it might be important.

30:00.630 --> 30:03.060
I got a call from a cab guy out in the south end.

30:03.160 --> 30:05.290
- What is it? - Well, it's this guy, Stegman.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.260
Shit. Hold on a second.

30:15.910 --> 30:19.140
On your knees, bitch. I want satisfaction.

30:20.380 --> 30:22.080
I'm on the phone, Pearl.

30:25.990 --> 30:28.610
That's Mistress Pearl, you piece of dog shit.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.880
I'm on the fucking phone!

30:35.430 --> 30:37.120
Make it quick?

30:37.230 --> 30:40.560
So, anyhow, this guy Stegman called. He sounded all nervous.

30:40.870 --> 30:43.960
Sounded like something scared the shit out of him.

30:44.070 --> 30:47.600
He said he had to talk to you. I said I'd see what I could do, Val.

30:48.380 --> 30:50.340
Yeah? Did he tell you what it was about?

30:50.440 --> 30:52.610
He said to tell you Lynn was dead.

30:52.710 --> 30:55.770
He said some guy came around talking mean and wanted you.

30:55.880 --> 30:59.110
And that's all he said. I thought you ought to know.

30:59.220 --> 31:02.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you did right. I wanna talk to that son of a bitch.

31:02.720 --> 31:04.160
Who, Stegman?

31:05.260 --> 31:08.090
No, President Nixon. Of course Stegman.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.960
Tell him Varrick's by the bridge.

31:11.170 --> 31:12.460
Make it...

31:14.470 --> 31:16.400
Make it 20 minutes?

31:30.120 --> 31:31.240
- Steggie. - Hey, Val.

31:31.350 --> 31:32.550
You know, I tried to call you,

31:32.620 --> 31:35.220
but you must have changed your number again. 'Cause I got nothing.

31:35.245 --> 31:38.845
I never gave you my original number, Steg.

31:39.790 --> 31:41.350
What did this guy look like?

31:41.460 --> 31:44.690
Well, he had, like, dark hair, blue eyes.

31:44.800 --> 31:47.500
He was like a real Cro-Magnon-looking bastard.

31:47.600 --> 31:50.160
Well, if Lynn's dead, maybe he did us a favor?

31:50.270 --> 31:53.210
I know what you mean, except I'm out like a grand a month, you know?

31:53.310 --> 31:55.610
Well, maybe we can work something out.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.940
Did you get a name?

31:58.610 --> 32:00.710
He said his name was Porter.

32:04.220 --> 32:08.310
- He said he was there for Porter? - No. No, he said he was Porter.

32:14.030 --> 32:15.960
Yeah. I'll tell you something.

32:16.200 --> 32:19.190
I wouldn't want that guy after me, either. I know how you must feel.

32:19.300 --> 32:21.600
What am I, a nobody?

32:21.800 --> 32:23.900
- No. - I've got friends.

32:24.370 --> 32:26.000
All I have to do is point.

32:26.110 --> 32:28.870
I pick up a phone, say his name, and he's a dead man.

32:28.980 --> 32:30.810
And this time he stays dead!

32:30.910 --> 32:33.740
All right, Val, try to keep it down. All right?

32:33.850 --> 32:35.150
It's okay.

32:36.150 --> 32:38.620
- What did he say about me? - He just... Nothing.

32:38.720 --> 32:42.250
- He just said you owed him money. - Not why? Nothing else?

32:42.390 --> 32:43.580
Nothing.

32:43.960 --> 32:47.220
- Why? How much you owe him? - None of your goddamn business.

32:48.030 --> 32:49.120
Well, I just, you know...

32:49.230 --> 32:51.890
I got the feeling he'd like to kill you, that's all.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.330
Oh, Christ.

32:54.500 --> 32:55.660
Porter.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.230
What?

33:02.880 --> 33:04.670
What did you tell him?

33:04.780 --> 33:07.040
Nothing. What could I tell him?

33:07.210 --> 33:09.710
You tell him about the money? The heroin?

33:09.820 --> 33:11.510
He had it with him.

33:11.620 --> 33:13.060
I just... I told him I delivered it.

33:13.120 --> 33:16.450
- You didn't tell him nothing else? - I don't know nothing else.

33:16.990 --> 33:19.120
Nah. You gave him something.

33:19.630 --> 33:21.820
A name, maybe. Someone who knows where to find me.

33:21.930 --> 33:25.370
- I swear, Val, on my mother... - Hey, fuck your mother!

33:26.070 --> 33:29.330
Hey, that's not nice. Now, why don't you try to take it easy?

33:29.440 --> 33:31.280
- What the fuck you looking at? - Take it easy.

33:31.305 --> 33:33.200
Val, don't. Come on. Not again. Don't do that.

33:33.310 --> 33:36.300
- What the fuck you looking at? - No, Val, no. Come on. Not again.

33:36.410 --> 33:39.130
- What the fuck are you looking at? - Val, come on, don't. Not again.

33:39.240 --> 33:41.440
- Come on, just forget it. - Is there some trouble here?

33:41.465 --> 33:43.820
No, you know what? We're... We're just... We're leaving.

33:43.920 --> 33:45.150
We're leaving.

33:45.750 --> 33:48.190
You know what, Val? This one's on me, okay?

33:48.290 --> 33:49.950
You see me reaching for my fucking wallet?

33:50.060 --> 33:51.050
No.

33:55.260 --> 33:58.960
- Hey, pal, is there a Michael here? - That's him over yonder.

34:01.600 --> 34:02.800
Michael.

34:03.200 --> 34:06.760
I'm told you're the man to see about expensive horizontal refreshment.

34:06.870 --> 34:09.000
I'm looking for a girl named Rosie.

34:09.710 --> 34:13.580
Prostitution is illegal, and you're speaking Greek.

34:17.219 --> 34:20.780
Usually these matters are conducted with more discretion.

34:25.489 --> 34:27.050
Be discreet now.

34:32.570 --> 34:34.469
- What was her name again? - Rosie.

34:34.570 --> 34:36.170
And who should I say is looking for her?

34:36.199 --> 34:37.670
Just call her.

34:47.449 --> 34:48.510
- Rosie? - Yeah.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.239
Give me the phone.

34:51.090 --> 34:52.139
Here.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.550
Take care of that.

34:55.790 --> 34:57.950
- Rosie. - Who the hell is this?

34:58.460 --> 35:01.590
- Porter. - Try again, honey. Porter's dead.

35:02.760 --> 35:06.600
I used to drive for you, provide a safe work environment.

35:07.570 --> 35:08.730
Porter?

35:09.840 --> 35:10.830
Yeah.

35:50.580 --> 35:51.600
Hi.

35:56.180 --> 35:57.810
Come on. Come in.

35:59.320 --> 36:01.810
You look pretty good for a dead guy.

36:07.900 --> 36:11.590
- How'd you hear about it? - People who know were talking.

36:12.130 --> 36:15.160
Plus, I heard your wife was back in town alone.

36:16.740 --> 36:18.070
She's dead.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.130
I'm sorry, Porter.

36:22.610 --> 36:23.630
Why?

36:25.050 --> 36:28.570
Jesus. Surly Porter. You're the same as ever, aren't you?

36:33.120 --> 36:35.180
This doesn't look like you.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.550
Yeah, well, people change.

36:39.530 --> 36:41.930
Stay. It's okay, baby. It's okay.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.530
Come on, sweetheart. It's okay.

36:44.970 --> 36:47.730
Meet the nastiest damn dog who ever lived.

36:50.400 --> 36:52.370
- What's his name? - Porter.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.330
He took your job after you left.

36:56.440 --> 36:59.610
He's just as tough, but he won't leave me, will you, baby?

37:08.590 --> 37:10.080
I need a favor.

37:11.060 --> 37:12.250
In favor?

37:13.060 --> 37:15.460
Maybe you're not the same as ever.

37:18.630 --> 37:20.930
I'm looking for a syndicate boy.

37:22.540 --> 37:24.700
It's the outfit, baby. We don't say syndicate anymore.

37:24.810 --> 37:27.240
Well, you know what I mean. Whatever the hell you call it.

37:27.340 --> 37:29.830
Don't get touchy, Porter. What's his name?

37:30.810 --> 37:32.180
Val Resnick.

37:34.620 --> 37:36.550
That son of a bitch.

37:37.850 --> 37:39.840
- You know him? - Yeah.

37:41.020 --> 37:43.680
I met up with him once a few years ago.

37:43.890 --> 37:47.160
He can't use Star Service anymore because he beats up all the girls.

37:47.260 --> 37:49.060
He almost killed one.

37:50.260 --> 37:51.290
You?

37:55.570 --> 37:58.830
Does it matter? You quit looking after me, remember?

38:02.440 --> 38:05.080
Would you happen to have a line on where he might be?

38:07.250 --> 38:10.650
- I suppose he's at the hotel. - Which one?

38:10.750 --> 38:12.910
The outfit hotel. They're all there.

38:14.220 --> 38:15.920
You got an address?

38:17.790 --> 38:19.550
We're friends, right?

38:20.460 --> 38:22.290
I mean, we used to be.

38:23.230 --> 38:24.290
But I'm an employee, too,

38:24.400 --> 38:26.375
and I don't think the outfit would like me telling you

38:26.400 --> 38:27.730
where the hotel was, would they?

38:27.830 --> 38:30.500
- No. What do you think I'm gonna do? - How strong are you, Porter?

38:30.600 --> 38:34.400
Personally, I think you are the strongest man I have ever met.

38:34.810 --> 38:36.900
But I wonder if it's enough.

38:37.380 --> 38:38.610
For what?

38:39.580 --> 38:43.240
If I know you, you want this Resnick guy for something he won't like.

38:43.350 --> 38:45.110
Yeah, I'm gonna kill him.

38:47.960 --> 38:50.220
That's something he won't like.

38:52.490 --> 38:54.360
What if something goes wrong, and they grab you

38:54.460 --> 38:56.620
and they ask you where you found out about the hotel?

38:56.730 --> 38:59.410
Why are we even talking about this? You know I wouldn't turn you in.

38:59.470 --> 39:01.260
I wouldn't talk about who told me what.

39:01.370 --> 39:03.560
But what if they ask you hard?

39:04.540 --> 39:07.870
I'll tell them it was a cab dispatcher named Stegman.

39:12.310 --> 39:14.680
The Oakwood Arms, Union and 17th.

39:23.660 --> 39:26.630
All this time, you don't even pretend to ask how I've been.

39:30.100 --> 39:32.090
You need any cash or anything?

39:36.770 --> 39:40.100
Get yourself killed, prick. I ought to tell him you're coming.

40:17.340 --> 40:18.540
Hi, Val.

40:21.010 --> 40:22.610
Where's my money?

40:28.560 --> 40:31.820
No, it's not there. I took your gun. It's back here.

40:32.390 --> 40:33.360
You look like a pro.

40:33.460 --> 40:36.430
You keep your mouth shut, and you'll walk out of here.

40:40.030 --> 40:41.900
My 70 grand, I want it.

40:43.900 --> 40:45.930
I don't have it right now.

40:46.710 --> 40:47.770
Where is it?

40:47.870 --> 40:52.540
I gave all $130,000 to the outfit. I gave it all to them.

40:53.810 --> 40:57.610
Well, tell them you gave them money that doesn't belong to you,

40:58.820 --> 41:00.380
and get it back.

41:00.550 --> 41:03.920
Now, Porter, I can't do that. I mean, you don't know these...

41:05.360 --> 41:08.620
You're gonna kill me whether I get the money or not.

41:08.830 --> 41:11.590
All right, I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get the money.

41:11.700 --> 41:13.190
Just give me a few days, all right?

41:13.300 --> 41:15.390
What the fuck are you doing?

41:16.270 --> 41:19.200
Noon. Tomorrow. Say it.

41:19.770 --> 41:20.900
All right.

41:21.010 --> 41:25.030
You know, this may sound crazy, Porter, but no hard feelings?

41:25.610 --> 41:28.780
I did what I had to do. You could appreciate that.

41:29.020 --> 41:30.780
Yeah, I appreciate that, you son of a bitch.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.510
No, no, no. Don't.

41:33.950 --> 41:36.180
Please. Allow me.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.660
Jesus. God.

41:52.770 --> 41:53.800
God.

41:55.010 --> 41:56.410
You bitch!

41:59.080 --> 42:00.510
Let her work.

42:14.130 --> 42:15.790
Me love you, baby.

42:17.760 --> 42:19.890
Me love you long time.

42:26.510 --> 42:28.200
Wait up, hon. Wait.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.470
Tomorrow. Noon.

42:37.080 --> 42:41.490
You and the money, be at the corner of 7th and Franklin at the pay phone.

42:42.920 --> 42:45.080
Okay. Okay.

42:47.230 --> 42:48.990
Where'd you get this?

42:50.930 --> 42:53.230
Some hooker had it on her shelf.

42:53.570 --> 42:56.330
I recognized you. I swiped it in case I could use it.

42:56.440 --> 42:58.030
Did you hurt her?

42:59.040 --> 43:01.200
The hooker, did you hurt her?

43:01.310 --> 43:03.970
What does that have to do with anything?

43:12.250 --> 43:14.150
I've got a few minutes.

43:15.360 --> 43:16.980
So go boil an egg.

43:30.170 --> 43:31.660
Can I help you?

43:34.670 --> 43:37.870
Val Resnick. I got an appointment with Mr. Carter.

43:39.310 --> 43:40.370
Yes.

43:42.520 --> 43:43.570
Turn around, please.

43:43.680 --> 43:45.360
Listen, sweetie, you don't have to do that.

43:45.385 --> 43:46.775
Turn around.

43:49.520 --> 43:50.850
Thank you.

44:01.070 --> 44:03.090
- Very nice. - You like that?

44:07.270 --> 44:10.000
- It's down there. - Yes.

44:11.750 --> 44:14.270
This isn't how Mr. Carter likes his visitors.

44:14.380 --> 44:15.580
I know.

44:15.950 --> 44:18.680
It's just I'm in a little bit of trouble right now.

44:18.790 --> 44:21.080
Yes, Mr. Carter thinks so, too.

44:22.490 --> 44:24.120
This way, please.

44:24.790 --> 44:28.450
Philip tells me you have a problem you need help with.

44:29.030 --> 44:30.260
Yes, sir.

44:31.230 --> 44:35.030
Is it your problem who breached our security last night at the Oakwood?

44:35.140 --> 44:36.360
Yes, sir.

44:36.670 --> 44:38.400
Then he breaks into my apartment...

44:38.510 --> 44:41.030
There's three ways that we can handle this.

44:41.140 --> 44:43.300
One, we can help you.

44:44.140 --> 44:46.610
Two, we can allow you to help yourself.

44:46.710 --> 44:49.240
And three, we can have you replaced.

44:51.590 --> 44:53.780
We have an investment in you, Resnick.

44:53.890 --> 44:58.260
So assisting you would be, in a way, protecting our investment.

44:59.630 --> 45:02.290
And that is always good business policy.

45:02.960 --> 45:07.090
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, Mr. Carter. Thank you, sir. You won't regret it.

45:07.770 --> 45:08.790
Now,

45:11.140 --> 45:14.660
according to Philip, a man has come to town to kill you?

45:14.810 --> 45:15.830
Yes, sir.

45:15.940 --> 45:18.880
And you say that he's alone and that he's a professional robber.

45:18.980 --> 45:20.000
Is that correct?

45:20.110 --> 45:24.070
Yes, sir. He does payroll jobs, banks, you know, stuff like that.

45:24.350 --> 45:26.340
- What's his name? - Porter.

45:27.750 --> 45:29.850
Well, what's his first name?

45:33.760 --> 45:34.850
You know, I don't know it.

45:34.960 --> 45:37.090
He never called himself anything but Porter.

45:48.940 --> 45:52.240
Where did you get the $130,000?

45:55.780 --> 45:58.550
That's why this man has come to town?

45:59.020 --> 46:01.510
The $130,000 that you paid us back?

46:02.020 --> 46:04.580
Yes, sir, but only $70,000 of it was his.

46:04.690 --> 46:07.180
Well, we never asked you where you got the money.

46:07.290 --> 46:08.950
It was none of our business.

46:09.060 --> 46:12.120
But now it appears it has become our business.

46:15.940 --> 46:18.030
Here's his file, Mr. Carter.

46:25.950 --> 46:29.570
Do you understand your value to the organization, Resnick?

46:31.620 --> 46:35.320
You're a sadist. You lack compunction. That comes in handy.

46:35.920 --> 46:38.890
But now you've allowed an area of your personal life

46:38.990 --> 46:40.960
to become a danger to us.

46:43.230 --> 46:47.000
A man in our organization needs to be tough and self-reliant.

46:48.640 --> 46:51.500
Were you to handle this problem on your own,

46:53.640 --> 46:55.540
there would be no doubt

46:57.380 --> 46:59.400
that you're the kind of man we want.

46:59.510 --> 47:00.810
I want to.

47:01.080 --> 47:04.180
- I want to handle it myself, Mr. Carter. - Great.

47:05.420 --> 47:06.580
Until the matter is handled,

47:06.690 --> 47:09.480
I want you to move out of the Oakwood Arms.

47:12.230 --> 47:14.060
But I don't have a place...

47:14.160 --> 47:17.290
I don't want any more unpleasantness at the hotel.

47:19.600 --> 47:20.830
Yes, sir.

47:21.740 --> 47:23.970
That's it. Val's in the doghouse, Spider.

47:24.070 --> 47:25.870
I'll fill you in on the way.

47:28.170 --> 47:30.040
He loves me. Let's go.

47:31.040 --> 47:32.740
He doesn't love you, Val.

47:33.080 --> 47:35.570
Sorry. We've been reassigned.

47:38.280 --> 47:39.550
Go ahead.

47:39.890 --> 47:43.690
After last night, I'm safer without you. Look at me. Look at this.

47:43.790 --> 47:45.720
What the fuck good are you?

47:45.830 --> 47:47.420
Get out of here.

47:47.760 --> 47:50.420
Never forget a pussy's face, you remember that.

47:52.770 --> 47:54.430
I'll do it myself.

47:56.670 --> 48:00.300
Do it myself. You want it done right!

48:00.540 --> 48:02.940
You got to do it yourself!

48:04.540 --> 48:06.810
It's the American way!

48:14.020 --> 48:16.720
- Yes? - Did your friends make it to town?

48:17.020 --> 48:19.650
Oh, yeah. Last night, baby.

48:20.090 --> 48:23.150
Good. Now, did you tell them it was Porter took that payroll?

48:23.260 --> 48:26.930
I did. And they want retribution.

48:27.700 --> 48:30.030
All right. All right. Here's what we do.

49:32.030 --> 49:33.290
Oh, shit.

49:56.120 --> 49:57.210
Shit.

50:01.960 --> 50:03.360
Next time, Porter.

50:07.500 --> 50:09.930
Looks like Porter's made some new friends.

50:28.990 --> 50:31.480
- Easy, mister. - I'm okay. I don't want to press charges.

50:31.590 --> 50:33.720
- Who were they, pal? - I don't know. I don't know.

50:33.830 --> 50:36.760
All right. I don't wanna... It's you guys.

50:36.860 --> 50:39.760
Our buddy Stegman says you got a line on a load of cash there, Porter.

50:39.870 --> 50:41.770
250 grand, to be exact.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.030
70.

50:45.910 --> 50:48.530
- Come on, man. Get off of me. - All right, all right, all right.

50:48.640 --> 50:51.200
What do you take us for? Idiots?

50:51.840 --> 50:54.040
Nobody'd go through all this shit for 70 grand.

50:54.150 --> 50:55.480
We don't like trouble, buddy.

50:55.580 --> 50:57.380
You look like a whole bunch of trouble to us.

50:57.480 --> 50:59.710
We found a dead girl full of heroin.

50:59.820 --> 51:01.220
There were signs of a struggle,

51:01.320 --> 51:03.480
and the coroner's not so sure it was an OD.

51:03.590 --> 51:05.350
We got a witness, though.

51:05.460 --> 51:07.320
A guy with only one nostril. Remember him?

51:07.430 --> 51:08.420
Yeah.

51:08.530 --> 51:11.430
Hey, don't worry, Porter. We're gonna give you immunity.

51:11.530 --> 51:13.830
Room to operate, "Get Out of Jail Free" card.

51:13.930 --> 51:16.400
All you got to do is get the money.

51:16.600 --> 51:18.800
We can't help you, though.

51:19.710 --> 51:22.770
- It'd be against the law. - You understand, Porter?

51:23.340 --> 51:25.570
- It's my money. - Wrong, Porter.

51:25.750 --> 51:26.840
Fuck!

51:27.810 --> 51:30.650
It's our money, Porter. Me and my partner's money.

51:31.220 --> 51:32.860
You be a good boy, we'll give you a piece.

51:32.920 --> 51:34.320
It will be easy, Porter.

51:35.220 --> 51:36.550
You got it?

51:36.890 --> 51:39.150
- Yeah, he's got it. - You understand?

51:40.260 --> 51:41.780
You take it easy? We'll be in touch.

51:41.890 --> 51:43.330
Sure, thanks.

51:45.970 --> 51:47.130
Fuck.

52:28.510 --> 52:31.200
Jesus Christ, Porter, you need to see a doctor.

52:31.310 --> 52:32.370
Yeah.

52:32.950 --> 52:36.240
- It's gonna sting. - Just clean it up, all right?

52:37.350 --> 52:39.380
- You hold it there. - Yeah, right.

52:51.930 --> 52:53.260
I'll do it.

52:59.110 --> 53:01.100
Tell me something, Porter.

53:03.510 --> 53:07.540
When did you decide to leave? Was it that night we slept together?

53:09.020 --> 53:10.000
No.

53:12.450 --> 53:15.720
It was the next day when I had to drive you to work.

53:20.630 --> 53:22.920
You could have asked me to quit.

53:27.100 --> 53:30.370
You could have asked me to drive you somewhere else.

53:44.360 --> 53:46.090
Hubba, hubba, hubba.

53:54.470 --> 53:55.630
Thanks.

53:56.580 --> 53:58.810
- Does it fit? - Oh, yeah.

53:59.680 --> 54:01.610
Like it was made for me.

54:02.850 --> 54:05.150
It'll look great in your casket.

54:16.100 --> 54:17.930
You know what I think?

54:18.360 --> 54:22.770
I think that all those stories about you being dead were true.

54:22.900 --> 54:25.670
You're just too thick-headed to admit it.

54:53.870 --> 54:56.160
Porter. God, I missed you.

54:56.970 --> 54:58.440
I missed you.

55:07.080 --> 55:09.410
- Don't talk. Don't. - Oh, no, I...

55:10.450 --> 55:12.310
I can't. I got...

55:14.790 --> 55:16.580
Stuff to do. I got...

56:00.370 --> 56:01.530
Porter.

56:08.810 --> 56:10.170
Where is he?

56:14.050 --> 56:15.780
Porter. Where is he?

56:16.580 --> 56:18.310
He's in the bedroom.

56:33.900 --> 56:35.390
Is he hurt bad?

56:37.240 --> 56:39.800
The doctor should be here any minute.

56:40.110 --> 56:41.870
No. That's bullshit.

56:56.520 --> 56:59.510
Porter, here I come, pally.

56:59.960 --> 57:01.120
Porter!

57:04.960 --> 57:06.430
Goddamn!

57:12.140 --> 57:13.570
Get in there!

57:20.110 --> 57:22.080
- Where is he? - He's gone!

57:22.250 --> 57:24.040
He's gone. He's gone.

57:24.150 --> 57:25.450
Gone?

57:29.320 --> 57:32.350
I know you. You're that whore from the picture.

57:34.830 --> 57:35.890
Yeah.

57:36.060 --> 57:37.820
How do you know him?

57:38.160 --> 57:39.930
He used to drive me.

57:40.700 --> 57:41.830
- Yeah? - Yeah.

57:44.640 --> 57:47.000
I'm driving you now, honey.

57:48.440 --> 57:50.870
- You know what you are? - Educate me.

57:50.980 --> 57:52.070
Okay.

57:52.180 --> 57:55.910
An ugly pig who beats up women on account he can't get it up

57:56.020 --> 57:58.750
'cause he's too terrified of his own fucking shadow!

57:58.850 --> 58:00.050
- Is that right? - Yep!

58:00.150 --> 58:01.410
- Is that right? - Yeah.

58:01.520 --> 58:03.680
Then I guess you must be the lucky girl.

58:06.560 --> 58:09.720
Sweetie, I am gonna fuck you six ways from Sunday.

58:29.010 --> 58:30.170
Jesus.

58:33.520 --> 58:35.210
Forgot my cigarettes.

58:40.690 --> 58:41.790
Shit.

58:45.860 --> 58:47.300
All right, Val.

58:48.170 --> 58:51.160
This syndicate, or outfit or whatever the hell you call it,

58:51.270 --> 58:52.700
it's got a head man, right?

58:53.540 --> 58:54.870
Who is it?

58:55.270 --> 58:56.940
They'll kill me, Porter.

58:57.040 --> 58:59.340
What do you think I'm gonna do to you? Worry about me.

58:59.450 --> 59:00.810
Goddamn!

59:01.980 --> 59:03.500
Names. Come on.

59:04.550 --> 59:05.980
Fairfax and Carter.

59:06.090 --> 59:08.110
Fairfax and Carter. They run the whole city.

59:08.220 --> 59:09.620
Fairfax and Carter.

59:09.720 --> 59:11.020
Where do I find them?

59:11.920 --> 59:13.820
Fairfax isn't in town right now.

59:14.490 --> 59:17.050
What about Carter? Where is he? Is he in town?

59:18.560 --> 59:20.960
Porter, it won't do you any good.

59:21.070 --> 59:23.500
They're gonna... Jesus! You...

59:25.440 --> 59:29.700
Frederick Carter Investments. 120 Commerce Avenue.

59:31.540 --> 59:33.480
Hey, thanks. There they are.

59:35.210 --> 59:38.210
All right. All right!

59:39.380 --> 59:40.940
I'll help you out.

59:41.790 --> 59:45.850
You're fucking nuts going up against the outfit for 70 grand,

59:45.960 --> 59:48.150
- but I'm gonna help you out. - Yeah?

59:48.990 --> 59:50.590
Here. Keep talking.

59:53.230 --> 59:54.930
Thanks. I...

59:56.640 --> 59:59.870
I can get you in there. Place is tighter than a drum.

59:59.970 --> 01:00:02.340
- How many guys in there? - But, well...

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.000
It's tighter than hell.

01:00:04.110 --> 01:00:06.080
They got only one guy on the outside, though,

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:08.010
so I got a way around...

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:15.650
You are crazy. You are a crazy son of a bitch.

01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:17.850
- That's why I love you. - Yep.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:21.390
- You got a light? - I... What?

01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:23.090
You got a light?

01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:27.190
Nerd.

01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:30.030
- Well, then what good are you? - Wait!

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:54.790
Rosie.

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:56.950
Rosie.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.930
Is your name on the lease here?

01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:08.060
The outfit. The outfit pays for everything.

01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:12.680
I want you to gather everything up that you need,

01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:14.780
say goodbye to this place.

01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:16.710
Okay?

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:53.860
- I told you he'd show up. - Give me my goddamn money, please.

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:55.550
Yeah, give me my money, too.

01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:58.890
Give me my goddamn money, please.

01:01:58.990 --> 01:02:01.050
- Sure that's him? - Yeah, that's him, come on.

01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:03.750
- Thank you very much. - Thank you.

01:02:03.775 --> 01:02:05.675
Yeah, there you go.

01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:09.390
- What you up to, buddy? - Well, our money's in there

01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:12.100
if you're still interested.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:16.070
Well, not in the dough but the boat I'm gonna buy with it.

01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:23.710
- What's he doing here? - It's a ride-along, Porter.

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:26.920
You see, your piece of the pie just got a little smaller.

01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:29.450
But don't worry, I'll leave you some crust.

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:35.820
What are you waiting for, Porter? Go get it. Go get our money.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:41.390
- You guys do me a favor? - We're here to help, buddy.

01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:44.510
Well, they're probably gonna frisk me when I go in there,

01:02:44.535 --> 01:02:46.860
so I wonder if you wouldn't mind holding on to this.

01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:48.100
Jesus.

01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:50.800
You know, just for a little while.

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:53.340
Sure, Porter.

01:02:56.550 --> 01:02:58.810
Hey, nice balance.

01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:03.510
Shower bag.

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:14.130
Can I help you?

01:03:14.970 --> 01:03:17.730
- Yeah, I want to see Mr. Carter. - And who are you?

01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:21.130
Tell him I'm the guy that whacked Val Resnick.

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:22.630
I'm sorry, I don't...

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.040
Didn't copy. Repeat.

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:31.410
Right.

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:36.290
Mr. Carter will see you. Turn around so I can frisk you.

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:42.490
So you popped old Val?

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.590
Thanks. Left pocket.

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:53.600
- Saving up? - Yeah, every little bit helps.

01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:55.960
Follow me.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.420
Bravo. Sit down.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:27.930
My compliments. They were two of my best.

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.100
No, they lull too easy.

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:38.180
48.

01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:44.980
There's something you want from me.

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:48.320
Val Resnick gave you $130,000.

01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:49.990
Paid us. It was a debt.

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:54.200
Well, $70,000 of it was mine, and I want it back.

01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:59.360
I'm sorry. Resnick told me, but I seem to have misplaced your name.

01:04:59.470 --> 01:05:01.670
- Porter. - Porter. Right.

01:05:02.170 --> 01:05:03.840
I won't forget it again.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.340
The outfit is not unreasonable, Porter,

01:05:08.410 --> 01:05:12.010
but no corporation in the world would agree to what you're asking.

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:14.750
What about Fairfax? Will he give me my money?

01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:18.090
Resnick told you quite a bit, didn't he?

01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:20.120
Fairfax will tell you the same thing I have.

01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:22.520
We're not authorized to do things like this.

01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:25.620
- Who is? Who makes the decisions? - Well, a committee would make

01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:28.290
- a decision in this case. - No, no. One man.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.930
You go high enough, you always come to one man. Who?

01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:45.520
Yeah, Fred Carter. I wanna talk to Bronson.

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:54.190
Yeah, sorry to bother you, but I have a problem.

01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:57.220
There's a man in my office with a gun who says he's gonna kill me

01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:59.960
if the outfit doesn't pay him $130,000...

01:06:00.070 --> 01:06:04.020
$70,000. It's 70... Let me talk to him.

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:07.130
Her.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.540
He wants to speak to you.

01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:18.270
The speaker.

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:26.660
This is Bronson.

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:29.350
How much is this guy Carter worth to you?

01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:31.760
Worth? What do you mean?

01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:34.260
Well, either I get my money, or I'll kill Carter.

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:36.730
I don't like to be threatened.

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:38.890
I'm not threatening you, I'm threatening Carter.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:39.990
Touch.

01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:42.200
An audacious man. Who are you?

01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:44.470
My money, yes or no?

01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:47.600
No.

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:53.580
Carter? Carter?

01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:56.280
Carter, what's happening?

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.920
Get some people down to Commerce street. Now.

01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:01.320
Carter?

01:07:02.330 --> 01:07:04.450
Speak to me. Carter?

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:07.560
You just don't get it, do you, you dumb fuck?

01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:11.630
I sure hope you're talking to him and not me.

01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:13.700
Carter! Carter!

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:14.960
I just croaked Carter.

01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:17.300
I want you to call Fairfax and tell him that.

01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:19.240
Smoke them if you got 'em, asshole.

01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:21.900
You've got 24 hours left to breathe.

01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:25.280
That's one day to get your tiny little world in order.

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:28.180
Do you understand that, sweetheart? Do you?

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.920
Porter, Porter, Porter, get my money.

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:34.100
- I see him, I see him, I see him. - Come on, come on, come on.

01:07:34.125 --> 01:07:35.285
Right here.

01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:40.800
- I don't see any cash. - They write you a check?

01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:44.000
They gave me the run around. I have to go and see another guy.

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:46.660
Last one, then we got a dead woman, an assault,

01:07:46.770 --> 01:07:49.370
and all kinds of stuff to talk to you about.

01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:52.930
That means more paperwork, Porter, and we don't like paperwork.

01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:57.540
Damn shame, Porter, but don't let the bastards get you down.

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.350
That's right, Porter. Don't give up.

01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:07.320
- Hey, can I have my piece back? - Oh, yeah.

01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:20.090
Nice roscoe, Porter. Heavy enough to be a nutcracker.

01:08:20.310 --> 01:08:21.970
We'll be in touch, Rocky.

01:08:24.279 --> 01:08:25.800
Keep up the good work.

01:08:25.939 --> 01:08:28.069
Rocky? Where did you get Rocky from?

01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:31.010
Squirrel on the cartoon. Rocky and Bullwinkle.

01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:21.430
Good to have you back in town, Mr. Fairfax.

01:09:21.529 --> 01:09:23.189
I wish I could say I was glad to be back.

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:25.859
I was swimming with the dolphins this morning.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:28.660
Easy, would you?

01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:31.569
It's genuine alligator, for God's sake. What's the matter with you?

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.370
Sorry, Mr. Fairfax.

01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:36.810
- Hello, Mr. Fairfax. - How's it going, Charlie?

01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:42.870
Well, between us and our neighborhood cops,

01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:45.450
I'd say we got him pretty well covered?

01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:48.130
Walter, wake up.

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:51.560
Walter!

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.319
Wake up!

01:09:54.370 --> 01:09:56.030
Keep those bags up, boys.

01:09:57.070 --> 01:10:00.530
- Who the hell are you? - I'm the reason you're back early.

01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:03.800
- You're Porter? - That's right.

01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:05.740
Keep those bags up above shoulder level, boys.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:07.570
You drop them and I'll drill you.

01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:14.380
Well, what'll you have me do, stand on my head?

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:18.460
No. I want you to do me a favor and call Mrs. Bronson,

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.680
see what we can do about my money.

01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:23.760
Well, she let Carter die.

01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:27.960
But that poor buck-toothed bastard is probably better off dead anyway.

01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:30.800
She'd probably let me die, too.

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:33.030
No, with Carter she thought I was bluffing.

01:10:36.210 --> 01:10:37.400
Try her.

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:39.300
All right.

01:10:41.050 --> 01:10:42.670
You two are fired.

01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:48.740
Hello? Yes, it's like this.

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:52.310
I'm standing in my living room and there's a man here named Porter

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:55.790
who says that he expects you to pay him sooner or later.

01:10:57.130 --> 01:10:58.560
Yes, of course.

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.620
- She wants to talk to you. - Put her on the speaker.

01:11:08.970 --> 01:11:10.200
This is Porter.

01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:12.440
I should probably have you just shoot Fairfax

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:15.100
and then hire you to run the city for me.

01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:18.670
Too bad you're just a punk with the right balls-to-brains ratio.

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:22.950
Honey, I wouldn't even get out of bed for 130 grand.

01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:25.750
You people aren't listening. It's not 130 grand...

01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:29.350
No, you listen. You got no place to go, Porter.

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:32.700
You're finished. Do you get what I'm talking about?

01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:35.090
Fairfax?

01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:37.230
- Hey, what the hell are you doing, man? - Fairfax?

01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:39.770
- Are you okay? - Yes. No, it's all right.

01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:43.710
He's just killing my alligator bags and shooting holes in my suit.

01:11:43.810 --> 01:11:46.940
- Man, that's just mean. - Okay, Porter, I give up.

01:11:47.150 --> 01:11:49.080
Where do you wanna pick up your money?

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:51.450
King's Cross Station.

01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:54.640
Send one man with a blue backpack full of cash.

01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:56.780
I'll be on the platform.

01:11:57.020 --> 01:12:00.620
- What's the name of the stop? - It's the end of the line.

01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:03.190
For you, too, sweetheart.

01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:11.460
You just signed your own death warrant for $130,000.

01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:16.230
I don't... I don't get that. What is it, the principle or something?

01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:19.330
No, I just want my money back.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.310
And it's only 70.

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.680
70? What do you mean it's only 70?

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.920
Only 70,000?

01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:35.720
Hell, my suits are worth more than that.

01:12:36.490 --> 01:12:39.430
Listen to this. "Ocean Ray Sundancer."

01:12:39.930 --> 01:12:44.160
"Vacuum-flush head. 80,000 bucks."

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:48.300
I'm telling you, you ain't gonna have it.

01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:51.530
- You wanna bet? - No, I don't wanna bet.

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.770
I'm out $150 already.

01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:59.410
$150 I'm getting my damn boat. Better come down with something.

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:00.880
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.380
Hicks, Leary,

01:13:03.490 --> 01:13:06.750
we're Holland and Vanowen. Internal Affairs.

01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:12.030
You boys wanna back off? We're on a stakeout here.

01:13:12.130 --> 01:13:15.100
- You wanna step out of the car, please? - What for?

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:17.630
I think you better step out of the car, Detectives.

01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:31.750
- What the hell's going on? - I don't know.

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:35.880
Is this your badge, Detective? The one you reported missing?

01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:41.450
- Yeah. Where'd you find it? - Where exactly did you lose it?

01:13:45.230 --> 01:13:46.860
Does this belong to you?

01:13:52.570 --> 01:13:55.900
- It's Porter. Follow him. - I got that motherfucker.

01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:07.410
Hey.

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.620
Get in, Porter.

01:14:21.330 --> 01:14:22.590
Close the door.

01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:26.160
Now set the roscoe on the floor.

01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:29.400
Slow.

01:14:33.710 --> 01:14:37.580
See, I am gonna turn you in to the outfit for a reward.

01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:40.580
And maybe they'll be so impressed that they'll ask me to join,

01:14:40.690 --> 01:14:42.410
and I'll be on easy street.

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.690
Medical, dental.

01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:48.550
I'm just... I'm gonna walk you right in.

01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:50.520
Porter on the hoof.

01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:53.000
Unless you get rambunctious.

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:56.190
Then I'll just have to take care of you myself...

01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:01.300
You're not gonna fucking kill me, are you?

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:09.610
Let him go.

01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:12.540
Now.

01:15:18.190 --> 01:15:19.710
Hubba, hubba, hubba.

01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:51.080
Hey. Hey. Hey, Porter!

01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:52.610
Hey!

01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:55.180
Hey, come on!

01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:25.250
Hey, handsome. This is a loading zone.

01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:27.950
So move me.

01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:30.350
So move.

01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:32.780
You Porter?

01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:35.850
Over there by your buddy. U-turn.

01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:59.710
We're taking a new position. Get in.

01:18:07.930 --> 01:18:10.720
- Where to? - Relax and you'll survive this.

01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:14.060
Keep your hands where I can see them. Take the next left.

01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:24.240
You know, I think I fucked you once.

01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:26.500
Oh, yeah?

01:18:30.450 --> 01:18:32.440
What do you think the odds are on twice?

01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:40.390
- I'll meet you at the L in 10 minutes. - I'll be there.

01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:49.290
I don't think your odds are good.

01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:53.960
You got anything to say?

01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:56.260
No, thank you.

01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:58.310
Then just stay here.

01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:25.590
Don't move.

01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:28.560
You got any friends here I should know about?

01:19:28.670 --> 01:19:30.540
You should try the men's room.

01:20:27.130 --> 01:20:28.160
Hey.

01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:31.330
Porter?

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:41.530
Step back here. Come on.

01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:02.960
The guy says you should drink this.

01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:04.930
- What guy? - Me.

01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:06.800
Take it in your right hand.

01:21:09.770 --> 01:21:11.240
Sit down.

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:15.080
Where's your piece?

01:21:15.610 --> 01:21:17.410
- Lunchbox. - Open it.

01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:21.340
Close it.

01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:38.430
Get on the train.

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:34.550
What...

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:55.200
Here it is.

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:02.980
Open it.

01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:06.050
It's all there. 130 grand.

01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:08.750
It's 70, you dumb bastards. Open it.

01:23:59.110 --> 01:24:00.410
Hey, Phil.

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:08.580
Jesus, how'd he make it?

01:24:14.430 --> 01:24:16.020
Come on! Move it!

01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:53.630
You think you can make everything okay, don't you?

01:24:54.730 --> 01:24:56.700
How strong are you, Porter?

01:24:57.230 --> 01:24:59.930
You know, this may sound crazy, Porter, but...

01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:01.750
You just don't get it, do you, you dumb...

01:25:02.670 --> 01:25:04.200
We'll hit them on Friday.

01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:06.300
Someone ought to give me a Ph.D.

01:25:06.410 --> 01:25:08.710
What are you gonna do, kill me?

01:25:08.810 --> 01:25:11.340
Please. Allow me.

01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:14.650
What is it, the principle or something?

01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:16.340
You look pretty good for a dead guy.

01:25:16.690 --> 01:25:18.660
Come on, baby, we got to get you out of here.

01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:21.420
Come with me. Come on, baby, we gotta go.

01:25:21.890 --> 01:25:25.830
Come on. Porter? Come on! Come on!

01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:27.490
Porter?

01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:30.770
Fuck! God damn it!

01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:33.670
Porter?

01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:37.800
Oh, Rosie.

01:25:41.010 --> 01:25:44.540
Red. Red.

01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:46.640
- Come on. - Rosie.

01:25:48.150 --> 01:25:51.140
- Help me out. - You're okay. Okay.

01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:04.800
- Backpack. Backpack. - I got it, I got it.

01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:12.230
- I got to get you to a hospital. - No hospitals.

01:26:12.710 --> 01:26:13.940
I know a guy.

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:17.210
- Is he a doctor? - No.

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:20.310
No.

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:25.180
- Tell me where to go. - Just drive, baby.
