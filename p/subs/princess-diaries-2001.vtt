- Oh.

16:23.024 --> 16:26.151

- All of us.

he would be able to find a woman

to live my life with you.

bowing and scraping. I was scared.

17:00.269 --> 17:03.063
[Mother] After the divorce,
we all discussed it.

17:03.231 --> 17:07.275
Your father and your grandmother
both agreed to keep their distance,

of a normal childhood.

to accept the throne,

18:33.613 --> 18:36.656
Genovia will cease to exist

18:36.824 --> 18:41.203

is in the hands of my 15 year old?

about me and my life

19:37.009 --> 19:39.427

who's a duchess?

However, you desperately need
some instruction.

20:11.961 --> 20:16.172
I speak for the entire Genovian
parliament and the royal family.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.216
And I speak for this family.

20:18.384 --> 20:21.887
Excuse me. I don't have a family
with either one of you,

20:22.054 --> 20:26.474
because you ignored me for 15 years
and you lied to me.

20:26.642 --> 20:30.228

to one another, OK?

16th birthday, not a country.

for a princess.

You will wear stockings,
not tights, not socks,

29:51.915 --> 29:54.584

those shoes again.

29:54.751 --> 29:59.172
When walking in a crowd,
one is under scrutiny all the time.

30:00.549 --> 30:03.718
So we don't schlump like this.

30:07.764 --> 30:11.976
We drop the shoulders,
we think tall.

We tuck under

30:19.234 --> 30:21.777
No. Princesses never

30:21.945 --> 30:24.739
Why don't you tuck one ankle
behind the other,

30:24.907 --> 30:27.950
and place the hands
gracefully on the knees.

30:29.369 --> 30:30.661

Mia, Mr. O'Connell is not married,
he's not living with anyone,

tattooed or hair plugged.

Do you realize how rare a find that is
south of Market Street?

30:57.981 --> 31:01.859
Did it ever occur to you that if you
dated one of my teachers,

31:02.027 --> 31:05.446
it would give the other kids license
to mock me for the rest of my life?

31:08.200 --> 31:10.868
You're right, I didn't and I'm sorry.

31:13.497 --> 31:16.958
It's just that Patrick...

You gotta use your hands.
Don't just stand there.

32:09.678 --> 32:14.265
You gotta go for it. You gotta think
like the ball, you gotta be the ball.

32:14.433 --> 32:17.268
You gotta stop it,

32:17.436 --> 32:18.978
- Ah.
- Bring it on.

32:26.028 --> 32:29.488
Hey, Joe. I'm gonna turn
the backseat into a dressing room

so I can change into
a proper outfit for Madame, OK?

- Ah. Thanks.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.580
Strange town, San Francisco.

32:37.748 --> 32:41.042
When I purchased the pumps,
they asked if I wanted them wrapped

I've never put on pantyhose,

33:24.461 --> 33:28.339
Grandma? Is it customary in Genovia
to imprison your dinner guests

33:28.507 --> 33:30.341
with Hermes scarves?

33:30.509 --> 33:34.095
It's Hermès.
The scarf is merely a training tool.

33:34.262 --> 33:38.099
Eventually you'll learn to sit
and eat properly without it.

33:39.601 --> 33:41.686
Manners matter.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.605

Now, Genovia does a lot of trade
with Spain,

33:47.776 --> 33:49.318
- so we prepare for that.
- Sorry.

33:49.486 --> 33:53.155

44:44.223 --> 44:45.932
Oh, Mr. O'Connell.

44:46.100 --> 44:49.519
There's a school rule that says
nobody's allowed to wear hats in class.

44:49.687 --> 44:53.231
I don't think anybody should be
an exception to that rule, do you?

44:53.399 --> 44:57.944
No, Lana. Mia, I'm sorry, but
hats are against the dress code.

44:59.781 --> 45:01.281
Mia?

45:05.328 --> 45:08.538
- [Girl] What?
- [Students murmuring]

45:08.706 --> 45:09.831
Mama Mia!

45:09.999 --> 45:13.293
- Look who's trying to fit in now.
- It's a wig, right?

45:13.461 --> 45:15.545
I think it looks really sweet, Mia.

45:15.713 --> 45:17.923
[Girl] Looks like she got a head
transplant.

45:18.091 --> 45:20.967
Well, I think it rocks,
and you know what?

45:21.135 --> 45:23.720
Voltaire, hair.

45:23.888 --> 45:27.933
I would personally
like to learn about Voltaire.

45:28.101 --> 45:29.267
OK, Lilly. OK.

45:29.435 --> 45:33.522
OK, everybody settle down now.
Quiz time, OK?

45:34.065 --> 45:37.234
[Clarisse] The roses are lovely,
but now we need fountains,

45:37.402 --> 45:38.902
lights in the trees.

45:39.070 --> 45:42.864
The Japanese Embassy has a waterfall,
why can't we have fountains?

45:43.032 --> 45:47.327
- We have a fountain up there.
- I would like at least two in here.

45:47.495 --> 45:50.414
- Charlotte, just make me an Eden.
- Yes, ma'am.

45:50.581 --> 45:52.457
Mm.

45:52.625 --> 45:54.459
- Amelia, let's continue.
- Hm?

45:55.920 --> 45:58.922
[Clarisse] In your spare time,
I would like you to read these.

45:59.132 --> 46:00.424
"What's in a name?

46:00.591 --> 46:03.885
That which we call a rose by
any other word would smell as sweet."

46:04.053 --> 46:07.055
And so, you wave to them
and acknowledge them gracefully.

46:07.223 --> 46:08.265
- Hello.
- No, no.

46:08.433 --> 46:12.686
Not quite so big,
it's very exhausting after awhile.

46:13.813 --> 46:16.440
Very funny, dear. Try it properly.

46:16.607 --> 46:18.984
Waving, even more gently.

46:19.152 --> 46:22.154
You sort of say,
thank you for being here today.

46:22.321 --> 46:24.239
- Thank you.
- Thank you for being here.

46:24.407 --> 46:28.285
I'm sorry, ma'am. I must pick up
the Prime Minister. Excuse me.

46:28.453 --> 46:30.787
[Both] Thank you for being here today.

46:33.958 --> 46:35.917
[Mia] So, this is considered art.

46:36.085 --> 46:39.296
My parents did this in the '60s.

46:39.464 --> 46:42.674
Yes!
They had an exhibition at Woodstock.

46:44.260 --> 46:45.802
I guess you're trying to bring it back?

46:45.970 --> 46:48.472
Well, yeah, this beats homework.

46:49.640 --> 46:52.934
Some moms help their kids
with homework, you do this.

46:53.936 --> 46:55.395
[Mia] Oh, nice shot.

46:55.563 --> 46:57.147
[Helen] Yes, I like it.

46:57.315 --> 46:58.523
Bull's-eye.

46:59.817 --> 47:01.610
[Both shouting]

47:07.283 --> 47:10.118
This is more fun than princess lessons.

47:12.914 --> 47:14.831
What're you doing Saturday night?

47:14.999 --> 47:16.958
Oh, are you guys playing?

47:17.126 --> 47:19.794
Rehearsing some new things.
We got two new songs.

47:19.962 --> 47:21.505
Oh yeah?

47:21.672 --> 47:24.716
Plus, surprise,
we got the new parts for your 'stang.

47:24.884 --> 47:26.510
Oh, yay!

47:26.677 --> 47:30.055
- We could put it together, together.
- OK, well, uh,

47:30.223 --> 47:32.807
- is this like a date?
- No.

47:34.602 --> 47:37.562
- Music, cars...
- Would it include pizza?

47:37.730 --> 47:39.147
Of course, pizza's a given.

47:39.315 --> 47:42.025
- With M&M's?
- Wait up! Wait up for me.

47:42.193 --> 47:44.110
Not you, I don't even know you.

47:44.278 --> 47:47.614
- Well, then I am in.
- Great.

47:47.782 --> 47:50.659
- Saturday, it's on.
- Yeah, great. Hi.

47:50.826 --> 47:53.370
- Hey, Lill. What's up?
- [Men shout indistinctly]

47:53.538 --> 47:55.455
- What's happening over there?
- I don't know.

47:55.623 --> 47:57.165
[Chattering]

47:57.333 --> 48:00.544
- [Mia] What's going on? Maybe.
- Maybe it's a protest.

48:00.711 --> 48:03.797
Excuse me. Hi.
Who are you all waiting for?

48:03.965 --> 48:05.882
There she is.
That's Mia Thermopolis.

48:06.050 --> 48:09.010
- We're waiting for you.
- Right here, Princess.

48:09.178 --> 48:11.304
- Lilly, did you tell?
- I didn't say anything.

48:11.472 --> 48:12.806
- [Clamoring]
- Princess Mia,

48:12.974 --> 48:14.391
who is your favorite actor?

48:14.559 --> 48:16.101
- Why are they calling her princess?
- Mia!

48:16.269 --> 48:20.522
- What do you do about pimples?
- Come on, let's just go.

48:20.690 --> 48:22.399
[All clamoring]

48:24.443 --> 48:26.570
Come on, Mia.
Let's get inside.

48:28.072 --> 48:31.157
- [Girls] Ohh.
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

48:31.325 --> 48:32.993
[Girls chattering]

48:34.161 --> 48:36.913
- The phone's ringing off the hook.
- What?

48:37.957 --> 48:39.374
Oh.

48:39.834 --> 48:42.627
[Patrick] Mia, your mother's on her way.

48:42.795 --> 48:45.255
- [Telephone rings]
- Gupta.

48:45.423 --> 48:47.924
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

48:48.092 --> 48:50.010
Mm-hm.

48:51.512 --> 48:54.097
The Queen is coming.
To Grove High School.

48:55.808 --> 48:57.642
[Woman] A limo with flags.

48:57.810 --> 48:59.603
[Man] The Genovian limousine
has arrived.

48:59.770 --> 49:01.646
The Queen is getting out.

49:02.356 --> 49:04.274
Why all the secrets?

49:04.442 --> 49:07.944
All we keep hearing is "no comment."
Do you have a comment?

49:08.112 --> 49:10.614
[Overlapping chatter]

49:11.115 --> 49:13.617
Are you taking the Princess home?

49:16.329 --> 49:18.663
Mom, I don't know who told on me.

49:18.831 --> 49:20.790
We'll get to the bottom of this.

49:20.958 --> 49:24.461
Here's your tea, your Majesty.
I'm sorry we don't have finer china.

49:24.629 --> 49:27.005
- It's perfectly all right.
- Here.

49:28.507 --> 49:30.300
Joseph.

49:34.472 --> 49:36.056
- [Joe] Speak.
- Paolo?

49:36.223 --> 49:39.559
Majesty. It was I who told the press.

49:39.727 --> 49:42.562
I outed you, so to speak.
I don't mean to imply...

49:42.730 --> 49:43.813
[foreign language]

49:43.981 --> 49:47.525
But not for money.
Paolo hates money, he spits on money.

49:47.693 --> 49:50.445
There was no money.
Well, there was some money.

49:50.613 --> 49:52.822
A man like me. Each ring is...

49:52.990 --> 49:56.993
The point is it was pride and ego
that drove me to know

49:57.161 --> 50:00.246
that royalty would see one day
the beauty was mine,

50:00.414 --> 50:01.581
the hair was mine.

50:01.749 --> 50:04.584
That I, Paolo Puttanesca,
was responsible...

50:04.752 --> 50:06.878
[both speaking Italian]

50:09.256 --> 50:12.384
By the way, your hair, magnificent.
Next time we go lighter.

50:12.551 --> 50:16.179
- Would you like to say anything?
- Isn't that just awful?

50:16.347 --> 50:19.015
Doesn't anyone
respect royalty anymore?

50:20.184 --> 50:22.686
What is it like in Genovia,
Your Majesty?

50:22.853 --> 50:25.063
Do people just fawn over you?

50:25.231 --> 50:28.733
I wonder, would you give us
a moment alone?

50:28.901 --> 50:33.071
- I'm the vice principal.
- Would you take this fine educator,

50:33.239 --> 50:37.075
and show her your security plans
for Amelia's safety?

50:37.243 --> 50:39.119
What?

50:39.286 --> 50:42.872
- Ah, yes, of course.
- Your Majesty. Thank you.

50:43.040 --> 50:46.376
- Your security system is a bit lax.
- Is it?

50:46.544 --> 50:48.920
[Helen] A week ago,
Mia was a normal, little kid.

50:49.088 --> 50:52.465
She has never been normal,
she was born royal.

50:52.633 --> 50:56.010
We cope with the press every single day,
and we will do it again.

50:56.178 --> 50:58.430
You don't have to do this.

50:58.597 --> 51:01.808
You can get out of
this whole thing right now.

51:01.976 --> 51:04.894
Your mother is right.
We had a bargain.

51:06.939 --> 51:12.777
All right. I will think about it
and let you know soon.

51:12.945 --> 51:15.280
Good. A diplomatic answer.

51:15.448 --> 51:18.575
Polite but vague.

51:18.743 --> 51:23.288
Mia is the daughter of local
eclectic artist, Helen Thermopolis.

51:23.456 --> 51:27.250
They currently live in a refurbished
firehouse south of Market Street.

51:27.418 --> 51:31.087
Mia is also the only grandchild
of Queen Clarisse Renaldi.

51:31.255 --> 51:34.424
Whose husband, King Rupert,
passed away last year.

51:34.592 --> 51:37.260
This is Nelson Davenport, KRLH.

51:38.471 --> 51:40.096
[School bell rings]

51:42.600 --> 51:44.142
[Woman over PA] Will the Feng Shui Club

51:44.310 --> 51:47.270
please stop rearranging the tables
on the lawn.

51:47.438 --> 51:51.399
Hello, princess!
You're the most popular girl in school,

51:51.567 --> 51:54.944
everybody wants to take your picture,
and be your best friend.

51:55.112 --> 51:57.614
- Hi, Lilly.
- Hi. So you know what?

51:57.782 --> 52:01.201
I've made a list of all the reasons
for you not to be a princess.

52:01.368 --> 52:03.495
Number one, no privacy.

52:03.662 --> 52:06.456
Number two, you always
have to look just right.

52:06.624 --> 52:07.957
- Number three...
- Whoo!

52:08.125 --> 52:09.959
[Mia laughing heartily]

52:10.127 --> 52:12.253
Are you OK?

52:12.421 --> 52:15.381
- What was number three?
- OK, number three:

52:15.549 --> 52:18.802
You can't go nutso.
You can't be all blah during the day.

52:18.969 --> 52:20.595
Lilly, Lilly, um,

52:20.763 --> 52:23.389
I really don't want to talk
about this at the moment.

52:23.557 --> 52:24.808
- OK?
- OK.

52:24.975 --> 52:27.435
One last question.
Now that you're "out,"

52:27.603 --> 52:29.395
would you come on my cable show
Saturday night?

52:29.563 --> 52:32.732
- Yeah, sure.
- I love you.

52:32.900 --> 52:36.820
I'm going to buy you another charm
for your charm bracelet. OK? OK.

52:36.987 --> 52:38.363
See you Saturday night.

52:38.531 --> 52:40.323
Joe!

52:44.578 --> 52:45.578
Yes, Miss Mia.

52:45.746 --> 52:49.582
I don't want to run my own country.
I just want to pass tenth grade.

52:49.750 --> 52:54.254
So... can't I tell everyone
I simply quit?

52:54.421 --> 52:58.049
No one can quit being who they are,
not even a princess.

52:58.217 --> 53:01.803
You can refuse the job,
but you are a princess by birth.

53:01.971 --> 53:03.847
How can I tell if I can even do the job?

53:04.014 --> 53:06.140
By simply trying.

53:06.308 --> 53:10.520
Like the fancy dinner coming up.
She thinks you're ready.

53:10.688 --> 53:12.355
Really?

53:12.982 --> 53:15.567
Shall we practice entering
like a princess?

53:15.734 --> 53:17.235
OK.

53:18.737 --> 53:20.697
Entering.

53:20.865 --> 53:24.659
At the Grand Ball,
you enter with the Queen,

53:24.827 --> 53:29.038
but at the State Dinner,
you enter unaccompanied.

53:29.206 --> 53:30.707
Shoulders back...

53:31.041 --> 53:35.253
...smile.
They're all happy to see you.

53:35.421 --> 53:38.047
- [Man 1] There she is.
- [Man 2] How is she?

53:38.215 --> 53:40.675
You are much prettier.

53:47.224 --> 53:49.601
Well done, the worst is over.

53:49.768 --> 53:53.187
Our diligent Prime Minister,
Sebastian Motaz.

53:53.355 --> 53:55.857
- Hello.
- His lovely wife, Sheila.

53:56.025 --> 53:57.108
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Hello.

53:57.276 --> 53:59.736
Their charming daughter, Marissa.

53:59.904 --> 54:02.196
Lord Fricker,
let me take your brandy glass.

54:02.364 --> 54:04.365
You won't need it in there.

54:04.533 --> 54:07.410
Easy on the schnapps,
remember the Winter Dinner.

54:07.578 --> 54:10.538
I'm not allowed to go to the party.

54:12.625 --> 54:14.542
Dinner is served.

54:14.710 --> 54:16.753
[Snoring]

54:18.839 --> 54:22.258
Her Majesty, Queen Clarisse.

54:26.138 --> 54:30.767
Someday we will own Genovia again
and you will be Queen.

54:30.935 --> 54:34.562
And your face
will be on a postage stamp.

54:49.119 --> 54:52.622
- How are the children, Robby?
- Would you like to see them, ma'am?

54:54.249 --> 54:57.585
There's Ryan and there's Bridget.

54:57.753 --> 55:00.505
[Clarisse] Ohh. They're beautiful.

55:00.673 --> 55:03.132
Would you like to see?

55:05.177 --> 55:09.138
Mr. Prime Minister, how would you say
the pear market is doing in Genovia?

55:09.306 --> 55:14.018
The Genovian pear market is blossoming,
if you'll pardon the pun.

55:14.186 --> 55:17.563
I hear they're serving
filet on the bone.

55:32.997 --> 55:35.832
And that's their princess.

55:36.959 --> 55:40.294
- They grow up so fast, don't they?
- Hi.

55:40.462 --> 55:43.297
- You wanted to see me?
- Is everything all right?

55:43.465 --> 55:46.342
- Yes.
- What happened with the ice bucket?

55:47.261 --> 55:48.386
Oh, um... [stammers]

55:48.554 --> 55:51.431
- I had a clumsy moment.
- OK.

55:52.224 --> 55:54.434
The food's delicious, by the way.

55:58.063 --> 56:01.691
[Sheila] It was for a feminist group in
Scotland called Tarts for Tartan.

56:01.859 --> 56:04.986
- They were a wild bunch.
- Very exciting.

56:05.571 --> 56:07.196
Thank you.

56:11.160 --> 56:13.202
Between the courses
to cleanse the palate.

56:13.370 --> 56:14.829
- Mm.
- Yeah?

56:23.756 --> 56:25.089
[Whimpering]

56:25.257 --> 56:27.175
[Muffled] I'm fine. It's cold!

56:27.342 --> 56:29.802
- She didn't realize it was frozen.
- What should we do?

56:29.970 --> 56:31.888
We should take that much, too.
Just do the same thing.

56:32.056 --> 56:35.391
- [Muffled] No!
- [Both moaning]

56:41.065 --> 56:43.024
They are acting like monkeys.

56:55.996 --> 56:58.998
Have you ever experienced
that instant headache

56:59.166 --> 57:00.750
when you eat ice too quickly?

57:02.753 --> 57:03.753
No.

57:08.092 --> 57:10.051
Wash your hands.

57:13.764 --> 57:15.389
[Clears throat]

57:21.396 --> 57:25.108
- I'm really sorry.
- It happens all the time.

57:26.110 --> 57:29.237
I would like to propose a toast,

57:29.404 --> 57:32.365
to the Baroness and Baron von Troken.

57:32.533 --> 57:35.576
May you always be Baron.

57:41.125 --> 57:43.793
The famous Genovian
pear and cheese dessert.

57:43.961 --> 57:45.795
What else?

57:53.137 --> 57:54.762
Ooh.

57:56.765 --> 57:59.392

No, actually I'm kind of excited.
I think I might get my first real kiss.

I just hope that if he kisses me,
um... my foot pops.

- Pops?
- Yeah.

01:10:30.018 --> 01:10:33.687
You know, in old films, whenever a girl
gets seriously kissed,

01:10:33.855 --> 01:10:37.441
her foot would just kind of pop.

No. Think about it.

01:22:37.578 --> 01:22:41.122
I just found out that my cable show
only reaches 12 people.

01:22:42.333 --> 01:22:47.003
Wanting to rock the world but having
zip power like me, that's a nightmare.

But you, wow.

01:22:49.757 --> 01:22:51.215

OK, what is so wow?

- Well...

We'll just have to
find a different miracle,

01:23:10.194 --> 01:23:13.196
not more, just different.

- Move it in, let's go.
- [Coach] Bobby Bad, hang up the phone.

01:23:57.825 --> 01:24:00.243
Yes, Mom. I'll go
to the dentist after school.

01:24:00.411 --> 01:24:02.203
I hate it when they move in like that.

01:24:02.371 --> 01:24:05.957
It's not a championship game, it's not
even a big game, it's just gym class.

I don't want to flunk you in gym class.

for the way I spoke to you
about the beach incident.

It was judgmental of me.
I didn't pause to verify the facts.

That's all right, Grandma.

I've been thinking about it
a great deal.

01:30:12.324 --> 01:30:16.452
The truth is, I think you'd make
a very fine princess.

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:20.289

are supposed to wear tiaras,

marry the prince, always look pretty
and live happily ever after.

You are an extraordinary person,
Grandma.

I'm meant to do this.

I would be so afraid that I would
disappoint the people of Genovia,

01:30:48.485 --> 01:30:53.405

to disappoint you again.

Well, as I said, I have faith in you.

- Mm-hm.

01:31:12.926 --> 01:31:16.512
- Ever see Middle House Road?
- No.

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:20.349
Big hit. I wrote a character
just like you once, he was a spy.

01:31:20.517 --> 01:31:24.770

your title for the press.

or something.

and I'm not Clarisse Renaldi.

to get Princess Mia?

Mia told Clarisse her mother
would be bringing her.

Mia was waiting for you.

[Father's voice] It is a custom in my

when one reaches this age.

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:45.888
I pass it on to you, as my father
passed it on to me.

01:34:46.056 --> 01:34:50.559
Amelia, courage is not the absence of
fear, but rather the judgment

01:34:50.727 --> 01:34:54.646
that something else
is more important than fear.

01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:11.927
She went that way, then that way,
two minutes ago.

01:38:12.804 --> 01:38:14.596
Thank you very much.

01:38:14.847 --> 01:38:17.975

- No. Everything's perfect.

Welcome to our grand
Genovian Independence Day Ball.

- You look fine.

my granddaughter has arrived.

With a fascinating explanation
as to her wardrobe, I'm sure.

01:41:25.037 --> 01:41:28.707
She's styling a wet,
sort of grunge-look hairdo,

01:41:28.875 --> 01:41:31.460
and is wearing a sweatshirt,
jeans and Docs.

I'm really no good at speech making.

Earlier this evening,

01:42:24.806 --> 01:42:28.391
I had every intention of
giving up my claim to the throne.

01:42:29.227 --> 01:42:33.230
And my mother helped me

01:42:33.397 --> 01:42:37.692
by telling me it was OK
and by supporting me,

01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:40.403
like she has for my entire life.

01:42:41.656 --> 01:42:45.909

after abdicating my role
as Princess of Genovia.

01:42:49.247 --> 01:42:52.457
Would I feel relieved,
would I feel sad?

how many stupid times a day
I use the word "I."

01:43:00.258 --> 01:43:04.261
In fact, probably all I ever do
is think about myself.

billion other people on the planet.

01:43:12.687 --> 01:43:15.522
But then I thought...

01:43:15.690 --> 01:43:21.611
If I cared about the other seven billion
out there, instead of just me,

01:43:21.779 --> 01:43:25.740
that's probably
a much better use of my time.

01:43:25.908 --> 01:43:29.828
See, if I were Princess of Genovia,

01:43:29.996 --> 01:43:35.417
then my thoughts and those
of people smarter than me

01:43:35.585 --> 01:43:39.504
would be much better heard
and just maybe,

01:43:39.672 --> 01:43:43.008
