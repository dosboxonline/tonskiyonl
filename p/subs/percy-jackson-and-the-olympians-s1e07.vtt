WEBVTT

00:01.125 --> 00:02.375
<i>Olympians fight.</i>

00:02.500 --> 00:04.291
<i>We betray. We backstab.</i>

00:04.416 --> 00:07.500
See, years before I was born,
my grandpa, Kronos,

00:07.500 --> 00:09.208
ate my aunts and uncles.

00:09.333 --> 00:11.250
My dad knows
he's not getting this bolt back

00:11.250 --> 00:12.750
with quests or goose chases.

00:13.166 --> 00:14.791
So we're gonna have a war.

00:15.291 --> 00:17.250
<i>They were talking about
what comes next.</i>

00:17.250 --> 00:20.125
Like getting Zeus and Poseidon to fight
was only the beginning

00:20.125 --> 00:22.375
and they're planning something bigger
on top of it.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.666
<i>We find Hermes.</i>

00:24.000 --> 00:26.416
We get him to hook us up
with a ride to Los Angeles

00:26.541 --> 00:28.083
and a plan to get into the Underworld.

00:28.500 --> 00:31.041
- We need your help to--
- I know what you need my help for.

00:31.458 --> 00:33.375
There is a way into the Underworld.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
<i>A secret way.</i>

00:40.541 --> 00:44.000
Each will provide one of you
safe passage back from the Underworld.

00:44.416 --> 00:45.541
There are four of them.

00:45.833 --> 00:46.916
Save the world...

00:47.708 --> 00:49.083
and then go save your mother.

01:16.875 --> 01:18.500
Welcome, weary traveler!

01:18.791 --> 01:20.916
Come on in and take a load off.

01:21.208 --> 01:23.291
These beds will change your...

01:24.750 --> 01:25.750
life.

01:27.875 --> 01:28.875
Well...

01:29.458 --> 01:30.625
hello there.

01:32.791 --> 01:34.458
Missing our mommy, are we?

01:35.291 --> 01:36.458
I know who you are.

01:37.833 --> 01:39.083
You’re Procrustes.

01:41.541 --> 01:44.041
Son of Poseidon,
and murderer of travelers.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.791
Crusty, please.

01:51.458 --> 01:52.458
And you...

01:53.541 --> 01:55.666
you’ve got Dad’s eyes.

01:57.875 --> 02:00.375
Take a load off. Relax for a minute.

02:02.375 --> 02:03.666
The beds are a trap.

02:04.916 --> 02:06.125
That’s how you do it.

02:07.041 --> 02:08.750
How you murder your guests.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.250
I do?

02:10.500 --> 02:13.166
I know there’s a secret passage
to the Underworld here.

02:13.625 --> 02:15.500
I know you were left here to guard it.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.041
But I need you to let me through.

02:21.250 --> 02:22.250
Please?

02:26.833 --> 02:30.666
In addition
to being incredibly comfortable,

02:31.625 --> 02:34.208
these beds are great

02:34.666 --> 02:36.333
for your self-confidence.

02:36.333 --> 02:39.625
- I’m really not interested--
- They show you how to fit.

02:41.083 --> 02:43.583
Fitting’s not easy
for guys like us, am I right?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.958
Our parents make it so hard.

02:47.833 --> 02:52.291
Stretching us and twisting us
and hacking off pieces

02:52.291 --> 02:54.500
to make us seem more like them.

02:56.625 --> 02:57.875
Anywho...

02:58.208 --> 03:01.458
these beds take all that away.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
With these beds, you just... fit.

03:08.916 --> 03:09.916
Try it.

03:11.166 --> 03:14.916
I think you'll feel much better.

03:19.125 --> 03:20.125
You first.

03:26.833 --> 03:27.833
You okay?

03:28.166 --> 03:30.041
Yeah, I’m fine.

03:31.041 --> 03:32.208
You won't save her.

03:32.833 --> 03:33.916
You won't be the first to try

03:33.916 --> 03:35.916
bringing someone back
from the Underworld.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.791
You won’t be the first to fail.

03:37.791 --> 03:38.875
Hey!

03:40.291 --> 03:42.291
You're lucky we're letting you
keep your head, dummy.

03:42.750 --> 03:43.791
Don't push it.

03:47.250 --> 03:48.333
Is it over?

03:53.541 --> 03:55.125
Are we sure this is the right way?

04:15.958 --> 04:17.291
It’s either the realm of the dead,

04:17.416 --> 04:19.916
or someone left a carton of milk
in there in the 1990s.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.208
Better?

04:31.541 --> 04:32.541
Much.

04:33.791 --> 04:35.125
If we get into trouble...

04:37.625 --> 04:39.250
...these are our tickets out.

04:40.458 --> 04:42.250
No one's turning back
till we all come back.

04:42.250 --> 04:45.083
No one comes back.

04:45.083 --> 04:47.708
Dude! Don't make me come back out there.

04:47.708 --> 04:49.708
We have no idea what's down there.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.125
I just think it's safer
if I'm not holding them all.

05:05.916 --> 05:07.083
Let's go get your mom.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.250
Well, we're not in Kansas anymore.

05:50.708 --> 05:51.708
What?

05:54.500 --> 05:56.166
I never show you that movie?

05:57.208 --> 05:58.250
Ah.

06:00.166 --> 06:02.875
I meant, we are only an hour
from the city

06:02.875 --> 06:04.875
and it feels like
we're on a different planet.

06:04.875 --> 06:08.666
- It’s so... peaceful.
- I'm not going.

06:11.833 --> 06:13.166
We discussed this.

06:14.375 --> 06:15.916
This is gonna be really good for you.

06:15.916 --> 06:18.166
Dr. Higgins says this is the best school,

06:18.166 --> 06:22.291
the best program in the state
for kids with learning differences, okay?

06:22.291 --> 06:25.125
- We were very lucky to get in.
- I'm not going.

06:25.125 --> 06:28.500
Percy, I know
that you do not want to do this,

06:28.500 --> 06:30.875
but sometimes I have to make choices

06:31.208 --> 06:33.875
that you may not understand.

06:33.875 --> 06:37.208
I'm not going!

06:49.458 --> 06:50.541
Percy!

06:52.166 --> 06:54.666
This is not a negotiation.

06:55.333 --> 06:58.625
The only question is
how ugly you are gonna make it

06:58.625 --> 07:00.208
before we say goodbye.

07:01.791 --> 07:04.625
Now, open the door.

07:06.625 --> 07:07.666
Fine!

07:14.125 --> 07:15.750
Grover, hurry up.

07:33.333 --> 07:34.458
Not in Kansas.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.458
Hey, focus.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.208
We left Kansas four days ago.

07:42.083 --> 07:43.125
Yeah. No, it's a...

07:45.416 --> 07:46.500
Never mind.

07:46.791 --> 07:49.708
Guys, is that who I think it is?

07:54.083 --> 07:56.208
Charon, the boatman,

07:56.583 --> 07:58.958
taking new arrivals across the River Styx.

07:59.958 --> 08:01.916
Which means that over there
is the main gate.

08:02.291 --> 08:05.208
- Let's go. Maybe we can get there first.
- Yeah.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.333
Why don't you let me
hang on to that for now?

08:15.416 --> 08:16.416
Come on.

08:18.416 --> 08:21.041
Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

08:21.041 --> 08:23.958
I'm sorry. Sorry.

08:24.083 --> 08:26.791
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

08:27.083 --> 08:28.333
We're with them, up there.

08:28.458 --> 08:30.291
Behind you. Sorry.

08:30.416 --> 08:33.166
- This seems so wrong.
- Nah.

08:34.458 --> 08:35.791
Only suckers wait in line.

08:35.791 --> 08:36.958
Just--

08:37.083 --> 08:39.583
You know, you should really
spend some time in the city with me.

08:39.708 --> 08:40.916
I think you’d learn a lot.

08:47.625 --> 08:48.833
You're not dead.

08:50.958 --> 08:51.958
I mean...

08:54.750 --> 08:56.083
we're all dying...

08:58.666 --> 08:59.958
to some extent.

09:03.125 --> 09:06.166
And you didn't pay to cross.

09:06.166 --> 09:07.875
Wait! We-- we can pay! We can pay!

09:08.375 --> 09:09.916
Here. Drachmas.

09:09.916 --> 09:11.875
Just take... take, uh...

09:12.625 --> 09:13.833
Just, you know, take them all.

09:20.208 --> 09:21.666
You can buy a new whistle.

09:35.083 --> 09:36.333
Go, go!

09:44.083 --> 09:45.083
Grover!

09:47.208 --> 09:48.291
Percy, that way!

11:03.125 --> 11:07.750
You... are a bad... bad dog!

11:07.916 --> 11:09.625
Guys! I can't hold this forever.

11:15.666 --> 11:17.375
Can you fly us up there with your shoes?

11:21.416 --> 11:22.541
You can do this.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.416
One at a time. Take Percy first.

11:27.458 --> 11:29.250
Maia.

11:43.541 --> 11:44.541
Annabeth!

12:04.500 --> 12:05.500
Guys?

12:19.875 --> 12:20.875
Excuse me.

12:45.583 --> 12:46.583
Wow.

12:47.416 --> 12:48.750
That was really...

12:50.083 --> 12:51.625
I mean, how did you...

12:52.750 --> 12:54.625
My father had a dog when I was little.

12:56.041 --> 12:57.625
I guess I remember the tricks.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.041
Oh, wow.

13:00.333 --> 13:01.333
Look at that.

13:08.833 --> 13:09.833
Hades's palace.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.416
That's where he'll be keeping
the master bolt.

13:15.833 --> 13:16.875
And your mom.

13:19.375 --> 13:20.458
Oh, no.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.541
What?

13:23.541 --> 13:25.291
My pearl. I lost the pearl.

13:27.750 --> 13:28.750
I think it's...

13:32.875 --> 13:33.958
It's in the dog.

13:38.833 --> 13:40.416
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

13:40.416 --> 13:42.375
But if we don't move,
it is not gonna matter.

13:42.375 --> 13:43.541
Come on.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.791
No. No. No, no, no, no.

13:54.791 --> 13:57.708
He is registered. I have the email
from your office right here,

13:57.708 --> 14:00.375
- saying that he's registered.
- I'm very sorry.

14:00.750 --> 14:03.500
But some new information came to light
that has forced us

14:03.666 --> 14:06.041
to reconsider your application.

14:06.916 --> 14:08.083
What kind of information?

14:08.458 --> 14:09.666
A drawing.

14:10.958 --> 14:12.958
- Oh, come on.
- A drawing that--

14:12.958 --> 14:14.250
It wasn’t a disciplinary issue.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.541
A drawing that caused
his previous school counselor

14:16.541 --> 14:19.250
to reach out to me personally
to express his concern.

14:20.208 --> 14:24.166
He drew a picture of a horse with wings.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.500
It isn't just the drawing.

14:26.750 --> 14:30.791
Our problem is that he was found
walking across the roof of the gymnasium,

14:30.791 --> 14:33.375
after which he said
he saw something out there.

14:34.291 --> 14:37.125
We aren’t equipped to offer
the kind of psychological monitoring

14:37.125 --> 14:39.208
we believe your child will require here.

14:39.208 --> 14:43.583
I have already withdrawn him
from his former school.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.375
He has no place else to go.

14:45.875 --> 14:47.458
Have you considered homeschool?

14:48.375 --> 14:49.416
Homeschool?

14:49.541 --> 14:50.666
I know.

14:50.666 --> 14:53.125
It sounds overwhelming
but there are resources to help.

14:53.125 --> 14:54.333
It's a real option.

14:55.375 --> 14:56.541
Some children...

14:57.083 --> 14:59.291
are better off being with their parent.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.458
I'm sorry, but no.

15:03.458 --> 15:06.458
I... I cannot accept that as an answer.

15:06.458 --> 15:10.000
So let's you and I
figure out a way to make this work.

15:21.375 --> 15:22.708
We can't ignore this.

15:23.041 --> 15:24.916
- Stop.
- It's just math.

15:25.166 --> 15:27.250
The three of us, plus your mom,
is four people,

15:27.250 --> 15:28.666
and only three pearls.

15:29.166 --> 15:30.458
Someone is staying behind

15:30.708 --> 15:31.916
and it should really be me.

15:31.916 --> 15:33.166
It wasn't your fault.

15:34.083 --> 15:36.750
And even if it were,
you're not getting left behind.

15:38.708 --> 15:39.708
Period.

15:40.375 --> 15:42.541
After we get the bolt and stop this war,

15:42.541 --> 15:44.000
you guys are leaving.

15:45.458 --> 15:46.458
With my mom.

15:50.708 --> 15:51.750
What about you?

15:53.791 --> 15:54.916
Wait, wait, wait, Percy.

15:54.916 --> 15:56.125
What about you?

15:56.125 --> 15:57.833
Quests aren't linear, right?

15:58.083 --> 15:59.458
I'll figure something out--

16:05.541 --> 16:06.541
Sorry.

16:09.833 --> 16:10.875
They can't hear you.

16:12.833 --> 16:13.833
"They"?

16:26.583 --> 16:28.000
This must be Asphodel.

16:29.375 --> 16:30.916
I read a book about this place.

16:35.166 --> 16:37.750
Wait. No, no. No, no, no, no, no.
What are you...

16:47.833 --> 16:48.833
Are those...

16:50.041 --> 16:51.041
roots?

16:56.500 --> 16:58.333
Souls here are bound by regret.

17:00.166 --> 17:02.166
Haunted by choices they made in life...

17:05.583 --> 17:06.708
...or never made.

17:25.958 --> 17:26.958
Annabeth!

17:29.333 --> 17:31.000
- Annabeth!
- Guys!

17:32.916 --> 17:33.916
Annabeth?

17:35.000 --> 17:36.625
- Guys!
- Annabeth!

17:41.416 --> 17:42.666
We've got a problem here.

17:47.041 --> 17:48.041
I already tried.

17:48.166 --> 17:49.250
It's too strong.

17:50.166 --> 17:51.208
How did this happen?

17:54.083 --> 17:56.708
It's some kind of regret, right?

17:59.458 --> 18:01.208
But what would you have to regret?

18:03.666 --> 18:04.666
It's okay.

18:04.791 --> 18:07.416
Go. I'll distract the dog
and buy you guys some time.

18:07.666 --> 18:09.375
Percy!

18:12.416 --> 18:13.416
This will work.

18:14.541 --> 18:15.625
I’ll be okay.

18:19.833 --> 18:21.583
I trust your dad.

18:22.875 --> 18:23.916
You can do this.

18:26.041 --> 18:27.041
I know you can.

18:30.625 --> 18:31.625
Run.

18:31.625 --> 18:32.750
Now!

18:46.250 --> 18:47.250
She made it.

18:48.250 --> 18:50.000
Let's go!

19:15.500 --> 19:16.541
Weird.

19:17.541 --> 19:19.083
Haven't heard the dog in a while.

19:21.916 --> 19:25.208
He chased us all that way
and then just... stopped?

19:27.500 --> 19:28.500
I wonder why.

19:29.166 --> 19:30.250
That’s what I’m saying.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.625
It’s weird.

19:35.333 --> 19:37.083
Grover?

19:37.083 --> 19:38.500
Grover, where are you going?

19:38.500 --> 19:41.291
I don't-- I don't know. I-- I can't stop!

19:41.583 --> 19:43.541
Percy! It's the shoes!

19:44.041 --> 19:45.083
Grover!

19:46.250 --> 19:47.250
Percy!

19:50.000 --> 19:51.250
Percy!

19:51.958 --> 19:53.541
- Grover!
- Percy!

20:25.250 --> 20:26.375
What was that?

20:59.166 --> 21:00.583
- Is this--
- No.

21:01.916 --> 21:03.083
I mean, it looks like--

21:03.250 --> 21:04.625
It absolutely is not.

21:05.458 --> 21:06.458
Okay.

21:08.916 --> 21:10.250
So, what is it then?

21:13.750 --> 21:15.666
- Yeah, that's the master bolt.
- I mean, I think so, right?

21:15.666 --> 21:16.916
How is it in your bag?

21:18.166 --> 21:19.666
Wait, this isn’t my bag.

21:21.500 --> 21:23.208
This is the bag Ares gave me.

21:26.541 --> 21:29.125
Ares had the master bolt this entire time
and tricked us.

21:30.291 --> 21:31.625
He was working with Hades?

21:31.791 --> 21:32.916
I guess so.

21:35.291 --> 21:36.375
I mean...

21:36.791 --> 21:39.833
that was it, right? That’s the quest.

21:43.416 --> 21:45.458
Zeus is expecting us to return this.

22:00.666 --> 22:02.500
Zeus is just gonna have to wait.

22:05.041 --> 22:06.250
Let's go get your mom.

22:11.875 --> 22:13.875
I know this is hard.

22:15.416 --> 22:17.208
I hope you know that I know that.

22:17.750 --> 22:19.875
But this school's gonna be
really good for you.

22:20.208 --> 22:21.291
I know that, too.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.041
Hey, listen...

22:28.916 --> 22:30.833
if you really don't like it there...

22:32.333 --> 22:34.500
we can look for other options. I mean it.

22:35.041 --> 22:36.041
I just...

22:37.583 --> 22:40.208
I want you to give this place a chance.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.500
I gotta take you back to school soon
to drop you off, so let's not...

22:54.333 --> 22:56.750
let's not spend the last few minutes
we have here like this.

22:56.750 --> 22:57.833
Why are you doing this?

23:00.541 --> 23:03.375
Why are you trying so hard
to get rid of me?

23:08.875 --> 23:10.500
I would never do this to you.

23:22.750 --> 23:23.916
I'm gonna go pay.

25:07.416 --> 25:08.791
Is this our stop, or...?

25:26.583 --> 25:28.458
Hey, fellas. Welcome!

25:29.250 --> 25:31.375
Sorry about all the... Oh...

25:31.666 --> 25:33.583
Anyways, it's great to meet you.

25:33.583 --> 25:36.000
I know who you are, and you know who I am,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.250
so we can just skip right past that part.

25:39.041 --> 25:40.166
Can I get you anything?

25:40.333 --> 25:42.041
Fresh pomegranate juice, a snack?

25:42.583 --> 25:43.791
- Actually, if--
- My mother.

25:45.166 --> 25:46.166
Boom.

25:46.166 --> 25:47.333
Straight to business.

25:48.250 --> 25:49.875
I admire the cut of your jib.

25:52.416 --> 25:54.125
Little nautical reference for you.

25:55.583 --> 25:56.583
I see you.

25:56.708 --> 25:57.708
Where is she?

25:58.458 --> 26:00.125
Right. Okey-doke.

26:00.541 --> 26:01.625
Let's get to it.

26:02.625 --> 26:03.958
Your mom's just over here.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.875
You've come all this way,
don't be shy.

26:35.833 --> 26:36.833
Mom?

26:43.583 --> 26:44.750
What did you do to her?

26:45.291 --> 26:46.375
Uh...

26:46.666 --> 26:48.750
Saved her life?

26:50.208 --> 26:52.500
You know, typically,
getting crushed by a Minotaur

26:52.500 --> 26:54.416
is a terminal diagnosis.

26:55.291 --> 26:56.625
I snagged her for ya,

26:57.041 --> 26:58.875
just in the "ta-da" nick of time,

26:59.625 --> 27:01.375
so that you would come see me.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.250
And here we are.

27:05.083 --> 27:06.416
You give me what you got,

27:06.833 --> 27:08.166
and I'm giving you what I got.

27:11.666 --> 27:12.666
I...

27:15.500 --> 27:16.791
I can't give it to you.

27:18.041 --> 27:21.166
- Ah, see, there's a quid and a quo here.
- The bolt doesn't belong to you.

27:22.333 --> 27:23.541
Your plan almost worked.

27:24.208 --> 27:26.625
You and Ares managed to steal the bolt,

27:26.625 --> 27:29.000
trick me into bringing it right down
and giving it to you.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.500
But it's wrong, and I won't do it.

27:34.208 --> 27:37.083
So all I can do is ask you
to do the right thing, too.

27:37.916 --> 27:38.916
Please...

27:40.000 --> 27:41.083
let my mom go.

27:44.916 --> 27:46.041
Huh?

27:46.041 --> 27:48.166
What?

27:48.416 --> 27:50.375
Who-- who tricked Ares into doing what?

27:50.375 --> 27:53.500
You’re in cahoots with Ares,
to secure the bolt.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.458
I'm not in cahoots with Ares.

27:55.708 --> 27:57.083
I seldom "cahoot."

27:57.083 --> 27:59.875
The bolt is my brothers' drama,
I don’t want any part of it.

28:00.708 --> 28:02.625
- You don’t want it?
- No.

28:03.541 --> 28:04.791
Then what do you want?

28:05.916 --> 28:06.916
My helm!

28:08.916 --> 28:09.958
Your what?

28:09.958 --> 28:11.958
My Helm of Darkness.
It went missing

28:12.125 --> 28:13.666
just days before someone

28:13.833 --> 28:16.250
used it to turn invisible
and steal the bolt.

28:16.791 --> 28:19.500
I'd like it back now, please,
and then you get your mom back.

28:19.916 --> 28:21.625
You really don't want the bolt?

28:21.625 --> 28:23.208
Why would I want that?

28:23.750 --> 28:25.250
To start a war between your brothers.

28:25.583 --> 28:27.000
Why would I want that?

28:27.833 --> 28:30.000
- Jealousy.
- I don't know if you noticed,

28:30.000 --> 28:32.166
but it's all candy canes and rainbows
down here.

28:32.166 --> 28:34.583
I'm managing just fine.

28:34.708 --> 28:36.000
I don't really do jealous.

28:36.958 --> 28:40.375
My brothers, on the other hand,
have the market cornered on jealous.

28:40.750 --> 28:43.250
Family drama is why
I don't go up there anymore.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.958
These grudges, they go on forever.
Super unhealthy.

28:48.125 --> 28:50.541
Someone stole Zeus's bolt,
it wasn't me,

28:50.541 --> 28:52.000
it must have been somebody who was--

28:52.125 --> 28:53.250
Kronos.

28:56.291 --> 28:57.416
Excuse me?

28:57.416 --> 28:59.458
He's got the longest grudge of them all.

28:59.750 --> 29:01.000
Zeus took Kronos's throne.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
Who else has a bigger reason
to weaken Zeus and take his throne back?

29:04.791 --> 29:06.125
Kronos is in a million pieces

29:06.125 --> 29:08.541
- at the bottom of--
- Tartarus, where something

29:08.666 --> 29:12.000
just tried to pull us into it
the moment the bolt appeared in our bag.

29:13.708 --> 29:14.708
Tartarus...

29:15.500 --> 29:18.083
where I've been hearing
a voice from in my dreams,

29:18.250 --> 29:21.000
telling me it needs my help
to take down Olympus.

29:21.791 --> 29:24.208
I assumed that was you,
but that voice I heard...

29:25.291 --> 29:27.291
that definitely did not sound like you.

29:38.583 --> 29:40.083
Ask me for sanctuary.

29:41.583 --> 29:42.583
What?

29:42.583 --> 29:43.875
If Kronos is somehow

29:44.041 --> 29:45.958
planning to emerge from his exile,

29:46.500 --> 29:48.166
and you were his first call...

29:49.208 --> 29:50.250
you're not safe.

29:51.166 --> 29:52.541
Ask me and I'll protect you.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.250
You and your mother.

29:56.166 --> 29:57.250
And the goat.

29:58.250 --> 29:59.625
I'll throw him in, on the house.

30:00.500 --> 30:03.083
This works out nicely for you
as it turns out.

30:04.083 --> 30:06.041
All it'll cost you is the bolt.

30:06.916 --> 30:08.333
I thought you didn’t want the bolt?

30:08.458 --> 30:09.833
I don’t want the bolt.

30:09.833 --> 30:11.166
Now, I need the bolt.

30:11.166 --> 30:13.833
If war with Kronos is coming,
I’d like to be prepared.

30:14.750 --> 30:16.083
Not messing around here, kid.

30:16.583 --> 30:18.291
This only ends one way.

30:18.291 --> 30:20.833
The only question
is how difficult you make it.

30:28.083 --> 30:29.083
No.

30:29.583 --> 30:31.875
Give me the bag.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.041
Nice pearl.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.416
I accept your offer.

30:37.833 --> 30:39.041
- Great!
- Your first offer.

30:39.208 --> 30:40.708
We're gonna go get your helm.

30:40.916 --> 30:43.416
And when I get back,
you're gonna let my mom go.

30:43.416 --> 30:45.000
- Okay. Hang on, kid.
- Grover, now!

30:48.416 --> 30:49.666
Hold fast, Mom.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.375
This isn't fair.

32:16.708 --> 32:17.708
No.

32:18.041 --> 32:19.041
It isn't.

32:20.750 --> 32:22.958
And I am failing.

32:23.166 --> 32:24.208
No, you're not.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
I'm going to take him to camp.

32:38.416 --> 32:39.416
Are you sure?

32:41.833 --> 32:44.041
What other choice do I have?

32:44.166 --> 32:46.333
He and I, living together in the city?

32:48.416 --> 32:51.750
It's starting to attract attention
from your world.

32:53.791 --> 32:56.000
A winged horse followed him to school.

32:58.416 --> 33:00.500
It saw him, he saw it.

33:04.250 --> 33:08.083
Sooner or later, it's not just gonna be
pretty things that are following him.

33:10.875 --> 33:13.375
At camp, he will be safe.

33:18.500 --> 33:20.833
- You don't want him at camp.
- No, no.

33:22.541 --> 33:24.625
No, I don't.

33:24.833 --> 33:25.916
Tell me why.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.625
You don't want to hear why.

33:32.958 --> 33:34.375
Probably not.

33:37.416 --> 33:39.333
But you have no one to say it to...

33:41.208 --> 33:44.291
and maybe
that's the most unfair part of it.

33:48.500 --> 33:49.500
You say it...

33:51.166 --> 33:52.250
and I will listen.

33:58.875 --> 34:01.583
I want him to know who he is...

34:04.625 --> 34:08.541
...before your family tries to tell him
who they want him to be.

34:12.541 --> 34:14.000
He is better than that.

34:16.833 --> 34:20.375
He has better things in him than that.

34:25.208 --> 34:27.041
Then I think you have your answer.

34:28.791 --> 34:30.250
He's going to go to school.

34:32.125 --> 34:35.041
And he's gonna learn things
that you can't teach him there.

34:37.541 --> 34:40.125
And it's gonna be hard
for the both of you.

34:42.041 --> 34:44.291
It's gonna be torture for the both of you.

34:46.833 --> 34:49.500
But he will be stronger for it
on the other side.

34:56.375 --> 34:58.541
His mother raised him well.

35:07.083 --> 35:08.791
Do you want to talk to him?

35:11.458 --> 35:12.833
I know you shouldn't, but...

35:14.958 --> 35:17.083
maybe just to hear his voice.

35:29.875 --> 35:30.875
One day.

35:37.583 --> 35:39.083
<i>One day, when he's ready.</i>

35:44.916 --> 35:46.416
<i>When he knows who he is...</i>

35:49.041 --> 35:50.583
<i>and where he belongs.</i>

35:59.208 --> 36:02.041
<i>And fate has revealed to him
his true path.</i>

36:18.083 --> 36:19.125
<i>On that day...</i>

36:23.791 --> 36:25.541
<i>...I'll be right by his side.</i>

38:11.708 --> 38:13.166
<i>You have to be very careful.</i>

38:14.208 --> 38:15.666
<i>You're more than a hero now.</i>

38:18.375 --> 38:21.333
<i>You are a leader
in the eyes of your fellow half-bloods.</i>

38:23.458 --> 38:24.750
<i>I'm here to see Zeus.</i>

38:27.791 --> 38:29.291
<i>I don't have an appointment.</i>
