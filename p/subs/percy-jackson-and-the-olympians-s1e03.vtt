00:02.083 --> 00:04.083
<i>The stories</i>

00:04.083 --> 00:06.708
<i>that I have told you
about Greek gods</i>

00:06.708 --> 00:09.125
<i>and heroes and monsters, they are real.</i>

00:09.416 --> 00:10.791
<i>You are a half-blood,</i>

00:11.333 --> 00:14.375
and half-bloods are not safe
in the world.

00:14.916 --> 00:19.916
<i>They reach a certain age, and they begin
to understand what they are.</i>

00:20.375 --> 00:22.458
<i>Terrible forces are driven</i>

00:22.625 --> 00:24.333
<i>to harm them before they can become
strong enough</i>

00:24.500 --> 00:25.541
<i>to fight back.</i>

00:26.083 --> 00:29.000
Don't worry, Mrs. Jackson.
Percy will be totally safe at camp--

00:29.000 --> 00:30.500
- Swear it.
- I swear.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.625
Mom!

00:41.333 --> 00:45.875
Welcome to camp, Percy Jackson.
We've been expecting you.

01:06.083 --> 01:07.166
Where am I?

01:09.208 --> 01:10.833
You drool when you sleep.

01:12.125 --> 01:13.125
Huh?

01:30.458 --> 01:33.166
It's okay. You're safe.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.041
It really happened.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.750
Well, it's a big deal
to kill a monster like that.

01:46.875 --> 01:48.625
- So, I wanted everyone to know--
- Did you see it?

01:50.416 --> 01:51.916
Did you see what happened to my mom?

01:52.833 --> 01:53.833
I did.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.583
I'm sorry...

01:57.208 --> 01:58.250
for...

02:00.041 --> 02:01.041
everything.

02:02.583 --> 02:05.166
My job was to protect you,
to get you here safely.

02:06.583 --> 02:08.416
Maybe if I'd told you the truth
a little sooner,

02:08.416 --> 02:09.875
- your mom would still be here--
- Please...

02:11.250 --> 02:12.291
stop.

02:13.166 --> 02:15.250
I know this isn't easy
but I wanna talk about it.

02:15.250 --> 02:16.333
I don't.

02:22.375 --> 02:23.958
Your job was to get me here alive.

02:25.166 --> 02:26.333
So your job is done.

02:29.541 --> 02:30.541
Where are you going?

02:34.166 --> 02:36.708
It was so important I get here
'cause my father's a god.

02:38.458 --> 02:39.541
So I'm gonna go find him.

02:42.208 --> 02:44.875
Yeah, but it isn't that... simple.

03:20.041 --> 03:23.500
Excuse me?
I'm Percy Jackson, I'm new here.

03:25.625 --> 03:27.708
Peter Johnson is here!

03:28.583 --> 03:32.041
'Kay. That isn't... really my name.

03:32.541 --> 03:34.333
I guess I'm looking for the office?

03:34.333 --> 03:37.291
- Or whoever's in charge, so...
- Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

03:37.416 --> 03:39.291
Wait, wait, wait. Percy, um,

03:40.166 --> 03:42.541
Mr. D, Camp Director.

03:43.041 --> 03:44.958
Mr. D, this is, uh, Percy Jackson.

03:45.208 --> 03:47.166
Yeah, Grover. I heard him the first time.

03:47.333 --> 03:48.791
- Yeah. But did you?
- Okay.

03:49.208 --> 03:51.125
You really don't wanna start
with this guy.

03:51.583 --> 03:53.083
- He's starting with me.
- Percy,

03:53.500 --> 03:55.458
the D is for Dionysus.

03:56.625 --> 03:57.916
That's Dionysus.

03:58.791 --> 04:00.375
What do you mean, Dionysus? The--

04:00.791 --> 04:03.041
- Like, the god, Dionysus?
- Yes.

04:03.750 --> 04:05.416
- No way.
- Yes.

04:12.125 --> 04:14.125
- Excuse me, Your Highness?
- Oh.

04:16.666 --> 04:19.125
I think my dad
may be around here somewhere.

04:22.125 --> 04:25.500
I don't know how to ask for him.
I don't-- I don't even know his name.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.708
But I think I should see him. I just...

04:32.583 --> 04:34.125
I think I really need that right now.

04:36.791 --> 04:37.791
Can you help me?

04:40.833 --> 04:41.833
Actually...

04:45.750 --> 04:47.000
I think I can.

04:49.750 --> 04:50.791
Son.

04:51.541 --> 04:52.916
- Dad?
- Yes, Peter.

04:53.375 --> 04:54.666
- It's Percy.
- Exactly.

04:54.833 --> 04:58.500
Now, before we get to know each other,

04:58.833 --> 05:03.625
there's something very important
I want you to do for me, okay?

05:05.458 --> 05:06.583
In the galley,

05:06.791 --> 05:12.750
there is a bottle
of 1985 ChÃ¢teau Haut-Brion.

05:13.166 --> 05:14.458
Will you go fetch that for me?

05:15.541 --> 05:17.250
Is that really all you have to say to me?

05:17.250 --> 05:19.541
- Hey, um, Mr. D, even if Percy was--
- Uh, uh, uh, bup!

05:19.958 --> 05:21.666
Grover, quiet, please.

05:21.666 --> 05:23.708
This is a nice moment, don't ruin it.

05:23.958 --> 05:25.291
The galley is right down that path.

05:25.458 --> 05:29.166
Grab that bottle and I'll talk to you
about whatever you want.

05:29.166 --> 05:30.666
You know, uh...

05:31.958 --> 05:34.666
you, uh... me, who cares?

05:55.958 --> 05:57.875
- Percy.
- Mr. Brunner?

05:58.583 --> 06:01.708
Uh, Mr. Brunner's real name is Chiron.

06:02.250 --> 06:06.041
Camp activities director,
immortal trainer of heroes, he is--

06:06.041 --> 06:08.333
Grover, thank you. I'll take it from here.

06:09.333 --> 06:12.333
Oh, Percy, this must be a lot
for you to process.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.666
Oh, no. It's-- it's fine.
I mean, you're a horse,

06:16.250 --> 06:18.750
my father won't talk to me
unless I get him a drink.

06:18.750 --> 06:20.041
Well, this all seems totally normal

06:20.041 --> 06:22.083
- and reasonable.
- Oh, no, no, no. No.

06:22.958 --> 06:24.416
Mr. D is not your father.

06:25.541 --> 06:27.375
- I could be.
- Yes, but are you?

06:28.041 --> 06:30.125
Why must you ruin everything?

06:30.708 --> 06:36.166
Mr. D knows that Zeus
has forbidden him from consuming alcohol.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.458
And that demigods are able
to do things for gods

06:39.458 --> 06:41.291
that gods are forbidden
to do for themselves.

06:41.291 --> 06:44.791
Mr. D was taking advantage of that. Hmm?

06:46.208 --> 06:47.250
Eh.

06:48.125 --> 06:49.125
Percy...

06:50.083 --> 06:52.916
walk with me,
and we'll start again. Hm?

06:55.791 --> 06:58.125
Uh, Grover, please give us a moment.

07:05.458 --> 07:07.000
This doesn't feel right.

07:07.541 --> 07:08.708
What, success?

07:09.583 --> 07:11.458
You got the boy to camp alive.

07:12.583 --> 07:13.625
Don't overthink it.

07:15.166 --> 07:17.083
Yeah, but it's...

07:28.083 --> 07:32.916
This is a sacred valley, Percy.
Humans can't see it.

07:34.250 --> 07:35.666
Monsters can't enter it.

07:37.291 --> 07:38.625
The world can't touch it.

07:40.708 --> 07:42.916
Great care was taken to bring you here.

07:44.166 --> 07:45.708
And great sacrifice.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.625
Hey, guys, wait for me!

07:49.208 --> 07:50.833
So, there's something
I gotta tell you.

07:51.791 --> 07:55.291
I lost your pen-sword thingy.

07:55.791 --> 07:57.166
Hopefully, that wasn't your only one.

07:57.541 --> 07:58.791
Check your pocket.

07:59.166 --> 08:02.833
No, I've-- I lost it the other night,
on the hill.

08:03.166 --> 08:04.333
Check your pocket.

08:08.833 --> 08:13.458
Unless you surrender it,
it will always find its way back to you.

08:14.125 --> 08:19.375
Magical objects don't obey
the physical laws of the ordinary world.

08:19.791 --> 08:24.625
Your pen, my wheelchair,
they're all a part of your father's world,

08:25.125 --> 08:26.250
as are you now.

08:31.541 --> 08:32.958
I have something to show you.

08:40.041 --> 08:43.833
Twelve cabins, for twelve Olympian gods.

08:46.333 --> 08:51.250
Each cabin is home
to the children that god has claimed.

08:53.250 --> 08:54.375
Great. Which one am I?

08:57.250 --> 08:58.916
You haven't been claimed, Percy.

08:59.583 --> 09:01.375
Well, when do I get claimed?

09:01.625 --> 09:05.000
Well, the gods reveal their design
in their own time, not before.

09:05.750 --> 09:08.875
Your father might claim you tomorrow,
it might be next week,

09:09.250 --> 09:10.833
- it might be--
- Never.

09:14.625 --> 09:17.250
Even now, he still wants
nothing to do with me.

09:19.375 --> 09:21.791
What am I even doing here?
There's no place for me here.

09:22.250 --> 09:23.625
There is a place for you.

09:24.875 --> 09:25.875
Here...

09:29.333 --> 09:31.208
Hermes, god of travelers.

09:32.083 --> 09:37.291
His cabin is home to both
his own children, and the unclaimed.

09:40.583 --> 09:42.916
- Everyone. Everyone.
- Wait-- wait a minute.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.208
Everyone...

09:45.291 --> 09:46.458
your attention, please.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.625
This is Percy Jackson.

09:51.416 --> 09:53.750
I trust you will see to whatever he needs.

09:58.208 --> 10:00.833
I know you feel powerless,

10:01.500 --> 10:04.833
but you're not.
All will reveal itself in time.

10:11.708 --> 10:13.541
- It jumped up there!
- I see it!

10:41.541 --> 10:44.208
That's the kid. I think
he's the one who killed the Minotaur.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.708
Look, if you want to give me
a hard time, just do it tomorrow.

10:52.666 --> 10:53.750
I can't do any more today.

10:54.625 --> 10:56.666
Heard what happened
to you on the hill. And I just...

10:59.083 --> 11:00.625
wanted to say I'm really sorry.

11:03.208 --> 11:05.625
I know what you're going through.
Believe me.

11:08.083 --> 11:09.083
I'm Luke.

11:13.375 --> 11:14.375
Percy.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.875
You've been picking at them again.

12:08.750 --> 12:09.750
Yeah.

12:10.291 --> 12:12.666
You're too hard on yourself, Grover.

12:13.625 --> 12:14.875
You always have been.

12:23.250 --> 12:24.750
Don't be nervous.

12:26.791 --> 12:28.083
Just be truthful.

12:30.541 --> 12:31.541
Okay.

12:57.166 --> 13:00.500
Mm.

13:05.416 --> 13:07.333
Sooner or later,
you're gonna have to choose.

13:09.791 --> 13:12.833
Sorry to interrupt.
Is now an okay time to talk?

13:12.833 --> 13:14.583
- No!
- Yes, go ahead.

13:16.791 --> 13:18.000
It's Sally Jackson.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.041
I think I know
what really happened to her.

13:21.416 --> 13:23.583
I've never seen a Minotaur
crush a human to death,

13:23.583 --> 13:27.208
but I just... I assume that they'd get
really squishy

13:27.208 --> 13:30.250
or something,
or like... like an old banana, maybe.

13:30.250 --> 13:32.291
- Grover--
- But she evaporated.

13:32.916 --> 13:34.041
Like a monster would.

13:35.083 --> 13:36.750
So, I-- I went to the Cloven Council,

13:36.750 --> 13:38.916
and they had actually heard
of this happening before.

13:39.416 --> 13:41.875
And that, when a mortal
is really close to death,

13:42.666 --> 13:44.958
Hades himself
can actually reach out and--

13:44.958 --> 13:46.666
Yes, we know.

13:48.708 --> 13:52.083
But you haven't told Percy anything yet?

13:52.500 --> 13:56.750
No. No one is gonna tell him anything.

13:59.250 --> 14:01.666
I'm... But doesn't he deserve
to know the truth?

14:01.791 --> 14:07.625
Grover, the truth can be very dangerous
if it isn't handled carefully.

14:09.166 --> 14:10.875
I don't want to lie to him anymore.

14:11.125 --> 14:12.416
Come on.

14:13.375 --> 14:16.041
There are powerful forces
at work here, boy.

14:16.625 --> 14:19.125
Forces that have laid waste
to the Earth before,

14:19.125 --> 14:20.708
and are close to doing it again.

14:21.458 --> 14:25.750
So, you don't wanna lie
to your little friend? Too bad.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.416
I suggest you steer clear of him, then.

14:28.791 --> 14:34.750
Because you will say nothing
to him about this. Do you understand?

15:04.000 --> 15:08.291
<i>Ah, he left you here,</i>

15:08.416 --> 15:11.750
<i>left you with nothing.</i>

15:13.500 --> 15:16.125
<i>I know how you feel.</i>

15:16.708 --> 15:21.000
<i>You want what's been taken from you.</i>

15:21.166 --> 15:25.541
<i>You want justice.</i>

15:31.541 --> 15:32.541
You okay?

15:33.875 --> 15:34.916
Super.

15:35.750 --> 15:37.333
We all have them, you know.

15:38.333 --> 15:41.333
Intense, recurring nightmares.
That's normal here.

15:41.916 --> 15:45.208
And the daydreams, and the ADHD,
and dyslexia.

15:45.833 --> 15:50.000
Demigods just process reality differently
than humans do.

15:50.333 --> 15:52.583
For the first time in your life,
you're just like everyone else.

15:54.208 --> 15:55.291
So are you also...

15:57.458 --> 16:00.000
- Do you not know who your--
- Am I unclaimed?

16:00.375 --> 16:02.333
No, Hermes is my father.

16:03.541 --> 16:05.375
That doesn't matter,
we're all on the same team here.

16:06.083 --> 16:07.625
Why is that okay?

16:08.500 --> 16:11.125
Why do they get to bring us here
to just ignore some of us?

16:11.583 --> 16:14.833
Spend too much time trying to figure out
why the gods do whatever it is they do,

16:14.833 --> 16:16.291
you'll drive yourself crazy.

16:16.625 --> 16:18.833
Sooner you stop worrying about that,
the sooner you can enjoy

16:18.833 --> 16:21.083
what this place actually does offer.

16:21.250 --> 16:22.250
And what's that?

16:23.583 --> 16:25.333
Glory.

16:25.458 --> 16:29.916
Demigods have always fought for glory.
They used to call it <i>kleos.</i>

16:30.541 --> 16:34.083
It's like this stuff
that attaches itself to your name.

16:34.208 --> 16:36.625
Makes it bigger, scarier, more important.

16:37.375 --> 16:38.916
People listen closer when you talk,

16:39.833 --> 16:41.500
they work harder to be your friend

16:42.166 --> 16:43.875
and they think twice
about messing with you.

16:44.541 --> 16:45.666
Hey!

16:45.916 --> 16:47.083
Woah!

16:47.083 --> 16:51.416
Hey. Knock it off, Clarisse.
It's like his first day, come on.

16:52.750 --> 16:56.916
Wait, so this is the kid
who killed the Minotaur. Is that right?

16:57.458 --> 16:58.458
Yeah?

16:58.458 --> 16:59.541
I'll bet.

17:00.583 --> 17:02.125
Look, you want attention
around here, dummy?

17:02.291 --> 17:04.000
You better be ready for it when it comes.

17:10.833 --> 17:12.958
- Well, she seems nice.
- Ares kids.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.833
They come by it honestly.

17:16.125 --> 17:18.041
- Why don't they mess with you?
- They know better.

17:18.375 --> 17:19.875
Luke's the strongest swordsman at camp.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.416
So, they leave you alone because "glory?"

17:25.375 --> 17:27.666
So if I get glory,
Clarisse wouldn't mess with me either?

17:27.958 --> 17:30.416
- Exactly.
- And people think I'm a big deal?

17:30.750 --> 17:31.958
Well, sorta, but--

17:32.083 --> 17:34.125
And my dad's got no choice
but to claim me.

17:35.416 --> 17:37.750
You can't force the gods to do anything.

17:38.166 --> 17:42.041
Well, yeah, but... it would make it harder
for him to pretend I don't exist, right?

17:42.833 --> 17:44.625
- Maybe.
- Well, great.

17:45.041 --> 17:46.125
Where do we start?

17:56.958 --> 17:59.250
A good source of glory are feats of skill.

18:00.125 --> 18:01.833
So, we gotta figure out
what you're good at.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.166
I wanna be very clear about this,

18:05.916 --> 18:10.125
I've never done anything like this before,
and it looks super dangerous.

18:10.458 --> 18:13.416
And you never killed
a Minotaur before either, 'til you did.

18:21.583 --> 18:22.625
I wouldn't.

18:34.708 --> 18:36.375
Should I try again?

18:36.500 --> 18:37.708
- No!
- No! No.

18:42.375 --> 18:43.458
Come on.

19:01.916 --> 19:03.416
Is there a Greek god of disappointment?

19:04.708 --> 19:06.875
Maybe someone should ask him
if he's missing a kid.

19:07.916 --> 19:11.375
Oizys... but she's a goddess.

19:11.625 --> 19:13.375
And her whole thing
isn't really disappointment,

19:13.500 --> 19:14.791
it's more like failure.

19:18.833 --> 19:22.625
We're gonna find the thing
that you're good at. I know it.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.791
- Our turn.
- Our turn for what?

19:30.208 --> 19:31.416
Burnt offerings.

19:31.875 --> 19:33.125
The gods like the smell,

19:33.125 --> 19:35.041
so it gets their attention
before you say a prayer.

19:35.458 --> 19:37.541
They like the smell of burnt mac & cheese?

19:37.708 --> 19:38.833
They like the smell of begging.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.416
You burn what you'll miss the most.

19:42.916 --> 19:45.458
Then they know you really mean
what you're about to say, so they listen.

20:13.375 --> 20:14.375
Hi, Mom.

20:17.166 --> 20:21.041
I don't know if I'm doing this right,
I hope you can hear me.

20:24.458 --> 20:25.791
I think you used to hate this.

20:29.291 --> 20:30.750
When the phone would ring

20:31.708 --> 20:33.958
the night after you left me
at a new school.

20:37.333 --> 20:39.458
I'd tell you that the people are awful.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.375
That I wanted to come home.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.958
Well... the good news is...

20:54.958 --> 20:56.250
this isn't that call.

20:59.333 --> 21:01.000
I hope you're sitting down, but...

21:03.958 --> 21:07.333
I think... I've made some friends here.

21:09.625 --> 21:12.375
Like, real friends.

21:14.958 --> 21:16.375
I think they might really like me.

21:20.041 --> 21:21.166
Imagine that.

21:27.875 --> 21:28.875
He isn't here.

21:30.916 --> 21:32.041
My father, he just...

21:34.083 --> 21:35.125
didn't show.

21:38.458 --> 21:43.291
I mean, ignoring me is one thing,
but he doesn't get to ignore you.

21:46.250 --> 21:47.750
I'm gonna make him come down here.

21:50.541 --> 21:52.166
I'm gonna make him see me.

21:56.625 --> 21:58.000
I'm gonna make him see us both.

22:26.458 --> 22:28.833
Hey, guys. Can't sleep, huh?

22:31.583 --> 22:34.458
Every new kid shows up here
and they think they're special.

22:35.958 --> 22:37.125
Do you think you're special?

22:39.166 --> 22:40.250
No.

22:45.291 --> 22:48.916
Tell me you made it all up
about the Minotaur, and I'll let you go.

22:48.916 --> 22:50.208
I didn't make anything up.

22:53.791 --> 22:55.500
Some kids gotta learn the hard way.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.166
I can explain.

23:42.625 --> 23:43.916
No, you can't.

23:45.041 --> 23:46.041
Okay.

23:48.291 --> 23:50.583
- Wait, I know you.
- No, you don't.

23:51.250 --> 23:54.583
Yeah, but you were there.
That night in the infirmary.

23:56.166 --> 23:58.416
Yes. I'm Annabeth.

23:58.958 --> 24:00.583
Are you stalking me, Annabeth?

24:01.750 --> 24:02.791
Yes.

24:03.416 --> 24:04.458
Okay.

24:06.375 --> 24:07.375
Why?

24:09.041 --> 24:12.833
Well, I've been waiting to see
if something like this would happen.

24:13.541 --> 24:14.833
So I'd know if you can help me.

24:15.916 --> 24:17.000
Help you do what?

24:17.875 --> 24:19.250
Win Capture the Flag.

24:28.541 --> 24:31.333
You're gonna love this.
Camp-wide mock warfare,

24:31.333 --> 24:32.750
all glory to the victors.

24:33.708 --> 24:35.958
Annabeth's the head counselor
of the Athena cabin.

24:36.500 --> 24:38.208
She's led our team to three straight wins.

24:38.208 --> 24:40.166
Been a long time
since anyone's won a fourth.

24:40.750 --> 24:42.083
She was there in the bathroom.

24:42.916 --> 24:45.333
She said she'd been waiting
for it to happen.

24:46.791 --> 24:50.250
Annabeth sees the world differently.
Always six steps ahead of everyone else.

24:51.083 --> 24:52.166
You should cut her a break.

24:52.416 --> 24:53.750
Whose side are you on, anyway?

24:53.958 --> 24:55.458
Oh, hers, always.

24:56.333 --> 24:57.458
She's my little sister.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.250
Maybe I should back up.

25:04.583 --> 25:06.083
Before camp, I was on the road.

25:06.458 --> 25:08.333
Me and a forbidden kid
I met along the way.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.083
Her name was Thalia.

25:10.625 --> 25:12.166
And what does that mean, forbidden?

25:12.458 --> 25:14.833
A long time ago,
Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades

25:14.833 --> 25:16.750
agreed their children
were becoming too powerful,

25:16.750 --> 25:19.375
so they made a pact
not to father any more.

25:19.833 --> 25:23.541
And it held for a long time,
until Zeus broke that pact.

25:23.666 --> 25:24.833
Until Thalia.

25:26.625 --> 25:29.583
A forbidden kid attracts trouble.
Monsters everywhere,

25:29.583 --> 25:31.875
it's just
a constant battle to stay alive.

25:33.250 --> 25:36.291
One day, we, uh, find
this little girl hiding in an alley.

25:36.583 --> 25:39.125
Annabeth. We were worried
about taking her in,

25:39.583 --> 25:41.208
exposing her to all that danger.

25:43.083 --> 25:44.958
Then we saw her fight.

25:48.666 --> 25:49.708
Thalia didn't make it.

25:51.750 --> 25:52.833
But Annabeth and me...

25:54.333 --> 25:55.333
we did.

25:56.125 --> 25:57.750
And we've been family ever since.

26:00.250 --> 26:03.458
She's been watching me
since I got here. Why?

26:04.166 --> 26:07.666
Annabeth is the strongest warrior in camp.

26:08.250 --> 26:11.250
The only way left to prove herself
is to go on a quest.

26:12.208 --> 26:13.875
And what does this have to do with me?

26:14.250 --> 26:16.208
Chiron's been promising her for years.

26:16.750 --> 26:19.708
One day, a demigod would arrive
who was fated to go on a quest

26:19.708 --> 26:21.208
that even Chiron couldn't prevent.

26:21.708 --> 26:23.125
And when that happened, she could join it.

26:23.750 --> 26:27.750
Every new arrival, Annabeth watches,
looking for a sign they're the one.

26:28.208 --> 26:31.625
Usually, she gives up after a day or two,
but she's still watching you.

26:32.500 --> 26:33.750
Can you ask her to knock it off?

26:34.291 --> 26:37.333
Yeah, sure. But what if she's right?

26:42.166 --> 26:43.166
Heroes...

26:44.666 --> 26:45.666
it's time.

26:47.583 --> 26:50.041
The game begins.

26:53.250 --> 26:57.166
The first team to retrieve
the opposing flag and return it

26:57.166 --> 27:00.041
across the river shall be the victor.

27:00.750 --> 27:05.208
As always,
there will be no maiming and no killing.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.250
I trust these rules will be respected.

27:11.083 --> 27:15.833
Any magical items you may possess,
are permitted as well.

27:16.875 --> 27:19.375
- Every camper who is not injured...
- It's okay.

27:19.375 --> 27:21.041
- ...has to play.
- Let her rip.

27:21.416 --> 27:23.666
Prisoners may be disarmed...

27:23.666 --> 27:25.125
I still don't even know what my job is.

27:25.125 --> 27:28.125
- ...but may not be bound or gagged.
- Maybe I won't even need a sword.

27:28.583 --> 27:30.208
Let the games begin.

27:36.041 --> 27:37.083
I'm gonna need a sword.

27:41.708 --> 27:45.291
All right. We have 20 minutes
before the second conch and game-on.

27:45.416 --> 27:47.333
- You know what you're doing?
- Yes, ma'am.

27:47.958 --> 27:49.000
Hey.

27:49.791 --> 27:51.291
Today feel like
a winning kind of day to you?

27:52.916 --> 27:54.125
I'll see you on the other side.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.291
Company! Move out!

27:58.833 --> 27:59.875
<i>Kleos!</i>

28:00.875 --> 28:03.250
Not you, sunshine. You're with me.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.250
Advance!

28:15.166 --> 28:18.125
- Move ahead!
- Stay in position!

28:32.583 --> 28:39.333
I'm fine, thanks. But I appreciate you,
you know, standing there silently.

28:46.500 --> 28:51.541
Listen, I-- I get it. Okay.
Y-- You're better at this than me,

28:52.541 --> 28:54.916
but I need this to go well today.

28:56.208 --> 29:00.416
I can't really get into it,
but I need my father to see it go well.

29:01.583 --> 29:04.500
So, if you're gonna expect me
to know how to do something

29:04.625 --> 29:05.875
I don't know how to do...

29:07.250 --> 29:11.458
and I end up falling flat on my face,
I-- I can't really have that right now.

29:21.458 --> 29:24.166
You still don't get where you fit
into all this, do you?

29:28.291 --> 29:29.291
Game on.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.083
Wait, what?

29:35.458 --> 29:36.833
Gift from my mom.

29:37.416 --> 29:38.833
Don't worry, you'll do great.

29:39.291 --> 29:40.875
Do great? Do what great?

30:09.125 --> 30:10.125
We give up.

30:13.458 --> 30:15.958
I wanna move quick.
Straight through the woods to their flag.

30:16.375 --> 30:18.958
Clarisse hunts in those woods
for the first few hours, you know that.

30:19.208 --> 30:21.250
- She's gonna cut us down.
- Annabeth's got a plan.

30:22.041 --> 30:23.041
Percy's on it.

30:24.333 --> 30:28.125
When it's time,
he's gonna be ready. I know it.

31:18.583 --> 31:20.000
Flag's that way. It's not here.

31:20.583 --> 31:21.583
We know.

31:23.625 --> 31:25.000
Yeah, glory's fine.

31:26.416 --> 31:27.916
Revenge is more fun.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.833
No maiming. It's like the one rule.

31:45.666 --> 31:48.166
Yeah, I guess I'll lose
dessert privileges for a while.

31:49.791 --> 31:50.833
I'll live.

32:12.833 --> 32:16.125
I'm actually not interested in maiming
or killing you, believe it or not.

32:16.708 --> 32:19.208
I just want you to admit you're a fraud.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.041
It'd make me feel better.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.250
Are you feeling up to that yet?

32:25.541 --> 32:28.416
Guess that's a no.

33:04.208 --> 33:05.333
Get back!

33:41.708 --> 33:44.458
No!

33:58.208 --> 34:00.000
Yeah!

34:10.583 --> 34:11.666
Not bad, hero.

34:17.333 --> 34:18.583
Were you here the whole time?

34:19.166 --> 34:20.166
Yes.

34:20.500 --> 34:22.750
You were here the whole time
and you didn't help me?

34:23.916 --> 34:25.958
- Yes.
- Why?

34:34.916 --> 34:35.958
Listen...

34:37.375 --> 34:38.375
Percy.

34:40.416 --> 34:41.541
I'm sorry.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.458
What is wrong with you?

35:06.666 --> 35:07.666
I don't understand.

35:22.791 --> 35:24.041
Your dad's calling.

35:36.833 --> 35:39.583
<i>You have been claimed by Poseidon,</i>

35:40.708 --> 35:43.333
<i>Earthshaker, Stormbringer.</i>

35:44.125 --> 35:45.416
<i>Percy Jackson,</i>

35:46.708 --> 35:49.083
<i>son of Poseidon.</i>

35:54.583 --> 35:56.666
<i>As a forbidden child of the Sea God,</i>

35:57.666 --> 36:01.375
<i>you are singular amongst demigods.</i>

36:02.416 --> 36:07.625
<i>And your father's only hope
to prevent the outbreak of war.</i>

36:09.333 --> 36:13.666
For months now,
Zeus and Poseidon have been locked

36:13.666 --> 36:15.916
in a dispute over the master bolt.

36:16.583 --> 36:20.958
The symbol of Zeus's authority,
and it has been stolen.

36:21.958 --> 36:23.666
- Who stole it?
- You did.

36:24.125 --> 36:25.125
What?

36:25.416 --> 36:29.208
Zeus is looking for a thief,
sees a forbidden child

36:29.416 --> 36:33.708
claimed by his jealous brother...
It doesn't look good for you, kid.

36:34.375 --> 36:35.833
I didn't do anything.

36:36.333 --> 36:40.083
Of course, you didn't.
But your father needs your help.

36:40.375 --> 36:43.625
An ultimatum has been given to him by Zeus

36:43.750 --> 36:48.333
that if he doesn't return the bolt
by the summer solstice in one week...

36:50.833 --> 36:51.958
there will be war.

36:53.166 --> 36:55.041
That is your quest.

36:55.875 --> 36:57.750
You must leave immediately.

36:58.250 --> 37:00.750
Leave? Leave for where?

37:01.000 --> 37:02.916
Zeus is king on Olympus

37:03.416 --> 37:06.333
and Poseidon has always resented it, but...

37:07.291 --> 37:11.750
there is a third brother
who has always deeply resented them both.

37:12.750 --> 37:14.375
- It's Hades.
- Yes.

37:16.250 --> 37:20.291
The bolt is with Hades. In the Underworld.

37:20.958 --> 37:23.541
I know it sounds daunting.

37:23.833 --> 37:27.833
But you won't be alone,
a quest is always undertaken by three.

37:28.208 --> 37:31.666
Great. Good luck finding those guys,
'cause it ain't gonna be me.

37:31.833 --> 37:35.291
Poseidon has claimed you.
This is his will.

37:35.791 --> 37:38.583
Poseidon has ignored me my entire life.

37:38.750 --> 37:41.666
- You are his son.
- I am Sally Jackson's son.

37:41.958 --> 37:43.375
Who's Sally Jackson?

37:45.750 --> 37:48.916
She's the one who cared enough
to call herself my mother.

37:49.583 --> 37:53.083
She's the one who got herself killed,
so that I could be safe here.

37:53.083 --> 37:56.958
The fate of the world
hangs in the balance.

37:57.416 --> 38:00.416
- You will accept this quest!
- I won't!

38:00.791 --> 38:01.833
- Hey, everybody.
- You--

38:03.083 --> 38:05.291
Grover, now is not the time.

38:05.416 --> 38:07.291
I'm sorry, sir. But I have news.

38:07.583 --> 38:10.041
- Grover...
- Sally Jackson is alive.

38:12.541 --> 38:15.166
It looked like she died,
but it only looked that way.

38:15.375 --> 38:17.250
- Grover.
- Your mother was stolen...

38:18.208 --> 38:19.250
by Hades.

38:20.375 --> 38:23.041
Which means she's with him now,
in the Underworld.

38:23.750 --> 38:25.416
That's where they want
you to go too, isn't it?

38:32.041 --> 38:33.500
If you can find her there...

38:35.541 --> 38:36.875
I think you can bring her back.

38:49.875 --> 38:50.875
When do we leave?

40:36.291 --> 40:37.375
Maia.

40:48.166 --> 40:49.583
<i>It's a pleasure to meet you,</i>

40:49.583 --> 40:51.166
<i>son of Poseidon.</i>

40:52.458 --> 40:53.541
I'm Medusa.
