00:01.333 --> 00:03.791
<i>Heroâ€™s quests
are world-defining events.</i>

00:03.791 --> 00:06.625
<i>They have made and broken empires.</i>

00:06.833 --> 00:09.291
<i>Altered the course
of human civilization.</i>

00:09.875 --> 00:11.500
<i>A quest is a sacred thing.</i>

00:11.666 --> 00:14.041
<i>And to be charged
with one is to be in conversation</i>

00:14.208 --> 00:15.666
<i>with the gods themselves.</i>

00:15.875 --> 00:17.875
<i>Monsters can't be avoided entirely.</i>

00:18.166 --> 00:19.625
<i>They're more common than you think.</i>

00:19.916 --> 00:21.791
<i>The trick is to spot them first,</i>

00:22.000 --> 00:23.875
<i>before they spot you.</i>

00:25.625 --> 00:29.833
<i>It's a pleasure to meet you,
son of Poseidon. I'm Medusa.</i>

00:30.000 --> 00:31.666
<i>Medusa offered
to help me save my mom</i>

00:31.791 --> 00:33.083
<i>if I turned on the two of you.</i>

00:33.291 --> 00:35.333
- <i>What'd you say?</i>
- <i>I cut off her head.</i>

00:38.750 --> 00:41.166
Percy, you can't ship
Medusa's head to Olympus.

00:42.041 --> 00:43.333
<i>Why not?</i>

00:43.458 --> 00:44.916
<i>Because the gods won't like it.</i>

01:08.583 --> 01:09.625
Ready?

01:09.958 --> 01:11.916
- You have to let go, Percy.
- I can't.

01:12.041 --> 01:14.250
Yep. You really can. You just have to try.

01:14.250 --> 01:16.625
- I did try.
- No, you didn't.

01:16.625 --> 01:18.750
We have been in the same position
for 15 minutes.

01:18.750 --> 01:20.625
Please. Come on. Just do it once with me.

01:21.125 --> 01:25.041
- Can we go home now?
- Percy, we paid for this class.

01:29.375 --> 01:32.250
You know I wouldn't ask you
to do this if it wasn't safe, right?

01:34.083 --> 01:38.083
Percy, it could be dangerous for you
if you don't know how to do this.

01:38.916 --> 01:41.666
One day, it could be really,
really important,

01:41.875 --> 01:43.500
and I may not be there to help you

01:43.708 --> 01:46.708
when that happens,
so I need to make sure you can do it.

01:46.708 --> 01:48.666
- Breathe.
- What?

01:49.666 --> 01:51.791
Just breathe, Mommy.

01:52.916 --> 01:54.666
That's what you always tell me to do.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.750
You'll always be here.

02:15.916 --> 02:17.833
Mom?

02:18.958 --> 02:20.500
Mom!

02:24.166 --> 02:27.875
<i>Hello again, little hero.</i>

02:28.708 --> 02:33.750
<i>What sort of trouble
are you up to now? Hmm?</i>

02:33.750 --> 02:37.875
<i>A forbidden child attracts attention.</i>

02:38.166 --> 02:42.375
<i>A forbidden hero? Well...</i>

02:42.500 --> 02:44.500
<i>They attract doom.</i>

02:45.083 --> 02:47.750
<i>She is coming.</i>

02:58.875 --> 03:00.208
Hey, you asleep?

03:04.208 --> 03:05.208
Yes.

03:08.625 --> 03:10.666
You and Thalia were really close, right?

03:12.958 --> 03:13.958
Yeah.

03:15.791 --> 03:16.916
What was she like?

03:19.708 --> 03:20.708
Why?

03:23.208 --> 03:25.500
She was the last forbidden kid
before me, right?

03:26.833 --> 03:28.625
She must've dealt
with the same kind of stuff.

03:30.125 --> 03:31.166
She was tough.

03:32.416 --> 03:35.125
I mean, she knew she was a forbidden kid,
she just didn't care.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.083
When Luke and Thalia found me,
Luke cared for me right away.

03:41.541 --> 03:43.333
But Thalia...

03:44.875 --> 03:45.875
she made me earn it.

03:47.250 --> 03:48.916
Is that why you give me a hard time?

03:50.041 --> 03:51.333
I gotta earn it with you too?

03:52.375 --> 03:54.875
Yeah. Maybe.

03:56.125 --> 03:58.208
I gotta say, that doesn't make
a lot of sense to me.

04:00.541 --> 04:01.958
What doesn't make sense to you?

04:02.916 --> 04:05.083
The way you guys all talk.

04:06.041 --> 04:07.833
The way the gods want us to think.

04:08.666 --> 04:11.166
Gotta burn an offering
to get a parent's attention.

04:11.916 --> 04:13.291
Gotta beat up on Clarisse

04:13.291 --> 04:16.000
just to get my father
to admit he's my father.

04:17.083 --> 04:18.750
It isn't supposed to work that way.

04:21.750 --> 04:24.541
People who are close to you
aren't supposed to treat you that way.

04:27.791 --> 04:30.583
You wanna know how I ended up alone
on the road in the first place?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.541
I started out as a gift to my father.

04:37.916 --> 04:39.291
That's how it works with Athena.

04:40.083 --> 04:41.708
We're born from a thought in her mind,

04:41.708 --> 04:44.083
and then given to a partner
she feels connected to.

04:45.791 --> 04:47.833
And for a while,
I was treated like a gift.

04:50.083 --> 04:51.416
My father cared for me.

04:54.291 --> 04:55.291
He loved me.

04:57.041 --> 04:58.041
I knew it.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.625
Then he met a woman.

05:04.083 --> 05:05.333
They had their own kids.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.166
And to her, I-- I wasn't a gift.

05:10.750 --> 05:11.833
I was a problem.

05:14.416 --> 05:15.416
So I left.

05:17.625 --> 05:18.625
I was seven.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.666
It isn't the gods who think that way.

05:25.583 --> 05:26.625
It's everybody.

05:29.791 --> 05:31.416
But at least with the gods
you know the rules.

05:32.083 --> 05:33.791
Show them respect
and they'll be in your corner,

05:33.791 --> 05:35.000
no matter what.

05:40.166 --> 05:41.666
You awake?

05:41.916 --> 05:43.750
Well, I am now. Thanks.

05:43.916 --> 05:45.791
Are you okay?

05:46.083 --> 05:47.875
He's super grouchy
when he doesn't get enough sleep.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.583
"He's super grouchy
when he doesn't get enough..." Nah!

05:51.250 --> 05:52.250
Wow.

05:52.250 --> 05:53.833
You've never been on the road
with him before.

05:55.083 --> 05:57.166
A little different
than a froofy boarding school.

05:57.166 --> 06:00.250
Who's froofy? You're froofy.
What's froofy?

06:02.208 --> 06:03.833
I think I need to eat.

06:22.041 --> 06:23.750
Two days
until we reach Los Angeles.

06:24.708 --> 06:26.833
Plenty of time before our deadline
to reach the Underworld.

06:29.416 --> 06:30.791
Can I ask a dumb question?

06:31.750 --> 06:33.583
It's like you need me to make fun of you.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.583
Shoot.

06:36.583 --> 06:38.375
I've never been to Los Angeles before.

06:38.750 --> 06:41.750
I'm guessing neither of you
have been to Los Angeles.

06:42.416 --> 06:45.000
So, how will we have any idea
where we're going?

06:46.083 --> 06:47.125
No idea.

06:48.166 --> 06:51.541
But that's like step 37,
and we're still on step four.

06:52.250 --> 06:53.666
Cross that bridge when we get there.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.708
- Follow-up stupid question.
- Dude.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.583
"And you shall fail
to save what matters most in the end."

07:01.875 --> 07:04.708
Back in Jersey, I told you the Oracle said
this quest would fail.

07:04.833 --> 07:06.166
And no one's mentioned it since.

07:07.875 --> 07:11.041
Seems like something we oughta be taking
a little more seriously.

07:12.833 --> 07:13.875
Hey.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.666
Look at that.

07:18.125 --> 07:20.041
- Are those...
- Centaurs.

07:30.041 --> 07:31.250
No one even knows they're there.

07:32.208 --> 07:34.708
There used to be herds of them everywhere.

07:35.416 --> 07:36.666
What happened to them?

07:37.583 --> 07:38.666
Humans.

07:41.500 --> 07:47.083
A few thousand years ago,
the god of the wild, Pan, disappeared.

07:48.625 --> 07:51.833
And ever since, without Pan
to protect the natural world,

07:51.833 --> 07:54.291
humans have been trying really hard
to chip away at it.

07:56.041 --> 07:59.041
The bravest satyrs volunteer
to become Searchers,

07:59.583 --> 08:01.000
trying to find Pan.

08:02.708 --> 08:04.083
None have ever returned.

08:06.666 --> 08:09.208
Your uncle
we found in Medusa's, Ferdinand.

08:11.083 --> 08:12.291
He was a Searcher?

08:17.041 --> 08:19.041
The Oracle didn't say
the quest would fail.

08:20.041 --> 08:23.708
"Fail to save what matters most."
That could mean a lot of things.

08:23.708 --> 08:26.541
That's how prophecies work,
that's how fate works.

08:27.291 --> 08:28.791
It could mean a lot of things.

08:29.791 --> 08:34.125
The harder you work to understand,
the harder it gets to understand.

08:35.708 --> 08:38.041
Sometimes, you've just gotta let it
come to you when it's ready.

08:39.416 --> 08:41.708
Excuse me. Can I see your tickets, please?

08:49.458 --> 08:50.833
You're in Cabin 17B?

09:05.875 --> 09:07.125
You wanna explain?

09:09.083 --> 09:11.583
Wait. Wait, you think we did this?

09:11.583 --> 09:15.333
- Did you?
- I mean... How? And why?

09:15.333 --> 09:18.583
Sir, when we left to get breakfast,
everything was intact.

09:19.041 --> 09:20.750
We don't know how this happened.

09:21.250 --> 09:24.500
We got a witness here,
says she heard the window smash,

09:25.041 --> 09:26.916
- and then heard children's voices.
- Oh, come on.

09:27.083 --> 09:28.583
Can you tell me what time
you left the cabin?

09:28.750 --> 09:30.125
Are we under arrest?

09:31.291 --> 09:33.416
I don't think you wanna take that tone
with me, little girl.

09:37.166 --> 09:38.625
Are we under arrest?

09:43.791 --> 09:45.125
So we're just killing time

09:45.125 --> 09:47.500
'til we find out that guy's
like a werewolf or something, right?

09:47.708 --> 09:50.791
<i>The train
is arriving at St. Louis Gateway station</i>

09:50.791 --> 09:52.916
<i>- in ten minutes.</i>
- I don't think he's a monster.

09:54.083 --> 09:55.208
Hard to say.

09:56.458 --> 09:58.625
Well, if he's not a monster,
what's going on here?

09:59.375 --> 10:01.041
Why would anyone tear our room apart?

10:01.541 --> 10:03.041
Maybe they were looking for something.

10:03.833 --> 10:05.041
We don't have anything.

10:05.041 --> 10:08.416
The people who think you stole
Zeus's master bolt might disagree.

10:08.958 --> 10:11.041
Right.

10:11.625 --> 10:14.000
Well, look, they're not gonna
find something we don't have.

10:15.375 --> 10:18.125
Either way, we aren't spending the day
answering questions

10:18.125 --> 10:19.625
in the St. Louis police station.

10:19.750 --> 10:22.000
We need to get out of this
before we get delayed.

10:23.375 --> 10:25.458
D-- Do you mind if I sit?

10:29.791 --> 10:31.166
You poor dears.

10:34.041 --> 10:35.625
Your parents aren't here, are they?

10:35.625 --> 10:38.458
Isn't that right, precious?

10:39.041 --> 10:41.875
Don't children get scared
when they're all alone?

10:43.541 --> 10:47.291
It's okay. I'm a mom.
I know how scared you must be.

10:49.416 --> 10:53.250
Excuse me.
Would you mind giving us a little space?

10:53.500 --> 10:54.541
I think...

10:55.291 --> 10:57.083
I think you're making them nervous.

11:03.291 --> 11:04.375
I want you to know...

11:05.625 --> 11:08.791
I don't actually think that you made
that mess back there.

11:09.750 --> 11:12.625
I just wanted a moment alone with you.

11:13.291 --> 11:16.791
There are some things
I need you to understand--

11:16.916 --> 11:18.125
You have something on your jacket.

11:18.916 --> 11:20.000
It looks like...

11:22.458 --> 11:23.708
It looks like glass.

11:27.125 --> 11:29.791
No one smashed out the windows
from inside our cabin.

11:31.416 --> 11:34.000
Someone smashed them in from the outside.

11:36.333 --> 11:39.500
Hm. Oh!

11:39.666 --> 11:41.250
Yes, sweetheart.

11:41.666 --> 11:43.458
I know, I know.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.833
You're impatient.

11:45.833 --> 11:48.208
Oh!

11:48.916 --> 11:52.166
But we're almost there.

11:55.791 --> 11:56.958
This isn't your fault.

11:57.833 --> 11:58.875
But sadly,

11:59.541 --> 12:03.875
you're going to have to bear the burden
of your parents' mistakes today.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.125
Listen, lady.

12:05.541 --> 12:07.708
I don't know who you are,
but I think I know what you are.

12:08.541 --> 12:11.541
We've run across a few monsters like you
and we've sent them all packing.

12:12.333 --> 12:15.666
Monsters like me?

12:16.875 --> 12:18.000
Well...

12:19.250 --> 12:21.125
of course they're like me.

12:23.166 --> 12:24.666
They were my children.

12:24.833 --> 12:26.833
Children?

12:27.583 --> 12:28.750
What does that mean?

12:29.958 --> 12:31.375
The Mother of Monsters.

12:32.541 --> 12:33.541
Echidna.

12:36.416 --> 12:38.875
Oh!

12:43.333 --> 12:44.416
Monster.

12:45.541 --> 12:46.833
Itâ€™s an odd word,

12:47.166 --> 12:51.375
considering my grandmother
is your great-grandmother,

12:51.708 --> 12:53.833
and this has always been a family story.

12:55.041 --> 12:57.458
But... to my eye,

12:58.333 --> 13:02.416
the demigod
is the more dangerous creature.

13:04.291 --> 13:05.333
Disruptive.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.375
Violent.

13:08.291 --> 13:10.250
If I exist for anything,

13:11.000 --> 13:15.125
it is to stand in the way of monsters

13:16.041 --> 13:17.125
like you.

13:19.875 --> 13:23.875
My little one here. She's just a pup now.

13:24.166 --> 13:26.833
Bless her heart.

13:27.666 --> 13:28.708
Today...

13:31.708 --> 13:33.125
you will be her prey.

13:37.875 --> 13:39.083
Are you afraid yet?

13:39.291 --> 13:42.791
Oh. It's all right. Fear is natural.

13:43.333 --> 13:45.375
It's also essential to the hunt.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.541
Your fear. Your doubt.

13:49.083 --> 13:51.458
Your confusion.

13:51.625 --> 13:55.625
I needed you to understand
what was happening

13:56.416 --> 13:59.083
so that she could track the scent.

14:01.166 --> 14:04.875
So that she could learn
and grow, because...

14:05.958 --> 14:08.708
that's what a good mother does
for her children.

14:09.791 --> 14:10.958
Not that you would know.

14:20.708 --> 14:22.041
You should run now.

14:25.958 --> 14:27.625
- No, sweetheart!
- Go!

14:31.291 --> 14:32.375
You! Stop!

14:33.791 --> 14:35.000
Stop!

14:37.333 --> 14:39.125
Silly girl.

14:39.416 --> 14:40.958
You got ahead of yourself.

14:41.833 --> 14:43.041
We'll work on that.

14:56.166 --> 14:57.833
Stop!

15:23.458 --> 15:24.458
Hey!

15:24.583 --> 15:26.125
- Percy.
- Open this door!

15:26.250 --> 15:28.250
Come back here and open this door!

15:28.250 --> 15:29.333
What is that?

15:30.083 --> 15:31.166
It's a stinger.

15:31.333 --> 15:33.291
Grover, do you know what kind of monster
has one of those?

15:33.291 --> 15:36.125
I don't know. I mean,
nothing good probably.

15:36.416 --> 15:38.625
- Do you feel okay?
- I think so. Why?

15:38.958 --> 15:40.375
Do you think it's poisonous or something?

15:40.375 --> 15:42.125
Open this door, right now!

15:42.250 --> 15:43.416
- I'm not sure.
- Come on.

15:43.416 --> 15:44.500
Hey!

15:57.000 --> 15:58.083
We gotta move.

16:00.208 --> 16:02.375
<i>This train is making an unplanned stop.</i>

16:02.375 --> 16:03.791
<i>Please remain seated for your--</i>

16:10.083 --> 16:11.416
Why isn't it still chasing us?

16:12.291 --> 16:15.416
Echidna said whatever she was hiding
in that carrier, it's young.

16:15.916 --> 16:17.625
It won't venture too far from her mother.

16:18.041 --> 16:19.250
She's learning to hunt...

16:20.791 --> 16:22.541
and this seems like the hunting part.

16:26.125 --> 16:28.375
We aren't gonna be able
to outrun them for very long.

16:29.125 --> 16:32.208
We don't need to.
We just need a safe place to hole up.

16:33.208 --> 16:34.208
Some place safe.

16:34.708 --> 16:36.666
Any ideas where we might find
one of those?

16:38.541 --> 16:39.541
I do.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.125
A sanctuary, dedicated to Athena,

16:42.458 --> 16:44.458
built by one of her demigod children
a long time ago.

16:44.791 --> 16:47.125
There is an Athenian temple
hidden somewhere

16:47.125 --> 16:48.958
in the middle of downtown St. Louis?

16:49.500 --> 16:50.500
Yes.

16:51.583 --> 16:53.500
Except it's not all that hidden.

17:05.375 --> 17:10.750
<i>It's 630 feet wide,
630 feet tall, both to within an inch.</i>

17:12.541 --> 17:14.041
<i>It's got no internal support.</i>

17:14.541 --> 17:16.750
<i>Each side is balanced perfectly
against the other.</i>

17:19.208 --> 17:20.666
<i>The arch is held up by symmetry.</i>

17:20.791 --> 17:22.458
<i>It's held up by math.</i>

17:22.458 --> 17:24.166
And it's earthquake-proof,

17:24.166 --> 17:25.708
so Poseidon can't ruin it.

17:26.916 --> 17:28.458
- Nice.
- Excuse me.

17:29.375 --> 17:31.791
This is how you show Athena your love.

17:32.500 --> 17:35.208
A monument to the power of perfection.

17:36.666 --> 17:38.416
It's a monument to some other stuff, too.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.958
You're talking about
what some humans

17:41.958 --> 17:43.291
want this place to be about.

17:44.333 --> 17:46.416
I'm talking about what it actually is.

17:47.958 --> 17:49.041
Whatever.

17:49.791 --> 17:51.166
We're safe here, right?

17:52.208 --> 17:55.000
No monsters can enter.
Not even Echidna.

17:55.666 --> 17:57.250
- We're safe.
- Great.

17:58.625 --> 18:00.791
Well, since our train exploded,

18:00.791 --> 18:03.208
I'm gonna see if there's another one
we can get tickets on.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.208
We can't stay here forever.

18:10.291 --> 18:12.750
Just because we're prey,
doesn't mean we need to be helpless.

18:17.333 --> 18:19.541
He doesn't like it
when people mess with animals.

18:21.125 --> 18:22.166
Yeah.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.083
I know.

18:25.625 --> 18:28.000
I shouldn't have s--
snapped at him, I just...

18:29.250 --> 18:31.333
I know.

18:33.375 --> 18:37.166
So, this is your mom's place?

18:38.458 --> 18:39.625
Wonder if she's around.

18:41.791 --> 18:43.916
Be right down!
Just going to the potty!

18:47.583 --> 18:50.458
- Nice.
- I have a gift.

18:53.916 --> 18:55.375
I guess you were right,
by the way.

18:56.375 --> 18:59.458
We needed a safe place,
and your mom had one waiting.

19:00.791 --> 19:02.875
Pretty lucky we happened to be
in the right city for it.

19:04.791 --> 19:05.791
Luck or fate?

19:10.666 --> 19:14.125
I know you think it's all just in my head.

19:14.125 --> 19:18.125
That... That I tell myself my mother cares
because it's easier that way.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.000
I didn't say that.

19:22.250 --> 19:24.375
Look, I've only been a demigod since...

19:25.375 --> 19:26.541
last Saturday.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.000
You shouldn't listen to me.

19:31.208 --> 19:36.875
You know, this is my mother's place,
but a temple is a temple.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.083
Maybe you could say hi to your dad
while we're here.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.541
No thanks.

19:44.208 --> 19:45.291
What could it hurt?

19:48.833 --> 19:50.083
Your thing with your mom...

19:51.958 --> 19:56.416
I get it. It's different.
It works for you. But my father...

19:59.041 --> 20:02.166
I don't want anything from him.
He's had his chances.

20:02.166 --> 20:05.416
Honestly, you've done more for me
in the past few days

20:05.541 --> 20:07.041
than my father has done in my entire life.

20:07.958 --> 20:09.458
If I have to stick with someone, I--

20:11.791 --> 20:12.916
Careful.

20:13.583 --> 20:15.250
I think you were about
to call me a friend.

20:16.250 --> 20:18.208
Somewhere around here
the Oracle is laughing at us,

20:18.208 --> 20:19.458
but you know-- Whoa!

20:19.458 --> 20:21.458
Percy!

20:21.583 --> 20:22.666
Hey! What happened?

20:22.666 --> 20:26.000
I think... I think those stinger things
were poisonous.

20:26.708 --> 20:28.333
I have an idea. Come on, help me.

20:28.708 --> 20:29.791
Okay.

20:37.250 --> 20:38.750
The water cured him
back at camp,

20:39.166 --> 20:40.875
it should work for poison too, right?

20:42.541 --> 20:44.541
You know, I think it's--
I think it's working.

20:45.500 --> 20:46.500
This was a great call.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.125
- Or not.
- Maybe it needs to be

20:52.125 --> 20:54.750
naturally running water
for Poseidon to be able to heal him.

20:59.625 --> 21:02.791
- Okay. We need to get back inside.
- No, we need to keep trying.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.833
This isn't working. And she's coming.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.166
Okay, look, we'll take Percy inside,
and we'll go the temple's altar.

21:12.375 --> 21:14.000
Altar? Where is there an altar?

21:14.000 --> 21:15.541
The highest point,
the best view.

21:15.750 --> 21:17.541
Okay, but what good
is that even gonna do us?

21:18.875 --> 21:21.916
We're gonna get to the altar
and we're going to ask my mom for help.

21:24.541 --> 21:25.875
I thought we don't ask for help.

21:30.083 --> 21:31.625
Come on, let's get moving.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.541
Guys, d-- did you hear that?

21:43.000 --> 21:44.041
Hear what?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.375
Never mind. Come on.

21:55.541 --> 21:58.708
<i>Please take your seats.
The trams are about to depart.</i>

22:03.958 --> 22:05.791
What was that back there?
What did you hear?

22:08.666 --> 22:09.666
She spoke to you.

22:11.125 --> 22:13.500
Alecto did that with me
back in the museum in New York.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.500
What did she say?

22:22.750 --> 22:24.125
Was that the Chimera?

22:25.250 --> 22:28.166
I think... I think that was the Chimera.

22:28.541 --> 22:30.833
How did the Chimera even get inside here?

22:30.958 --> 22:33.416
- How did any monster get inside here?
- Annabeth?

22:33.541 --> 22:36.916
We're in a sanctuary.
Athena would have had to let her in,

22:36.916 --> 22:38.458
- but why would she do that?
- Annabeth!

22:39.666 --> 22:41.000
What did Echidna say to you?

22:44.041 --> 22:46.916
She said my impertinence wounded
my mother's pride.

22:47.875 --> 22:49.833
And that that will be my doom.

22:50.875 --> 22:52.000
Impertinence? What kind of--

22:54.458 --> 22:55.583
Medusa's head.

22:57.750 --> 22:59.083
I embarrassed my mother.

23:01.458 --> 23:03.458
But I'm the one
who sent the head to Olympus.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.166
- I signed the note.
- And I went along with it.

23:08.416 --> 23:09.583
It embarrassed her.

23:10.458 --> 23:11.583
Now, she's angry.

23:12.833 --> 23:14.666
Guys, what are we gonna do?

23:15.833 --> 23:18.125
She isn't gonna help us
when we get to the top to save Percy.

23:18.541 --> 23:21.541
No, I meant, what are we gonna do
about Echidna and Chimera?

23:22.083 --> 23:23.500
They're gonna be right behind us.

23:24.750 --> 23:27.083
We're not gonna have much time.

23:27.541 --> 23:28.666
They'll be up here any minute.

23:28.791 --> 23:30.791
And if my mother isn't going
to protect us,

23:31.541 --> 23:33.250
then we'll just have
to fight it out up here.

23:43.125 --> 23:44.125
Oh, no.

23:44.458 --> 23:46.333
We gotta get everybody outta here.

23:55.291 --> 23:57.458
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

23:57.583 --> 24:00.208
- Everyone, let's line up.
- You and Percy follow them down.

24:00.375 --> 24:02.791
What? No, no, no.
W-- We're not splitting up.

24:02.791 --> 24:03.875
Grover, come on.

24:03.875 --> 24:06.416
No. No, no, no, no, no,
we're all getting out of here together.

24:06.416 --> 24:10.458
We won't make it.
The Chimera is the demigod-killer.

24:10.958 --> 24:13.958
Someone has to stay back to slow her down
and buy everyone some time.

24:14.666 --> 24:15.750
Come on.

24:18.291 --> 24:20.875
Okay, help him down the stairs
and get him to the river.

24:21.208 --> 24:23.625
And don't stop. Not till you get to Hades,

24:24.000 --> 24:26.416
not till you have the bolt,
do you hear me?

24:28.750 --> 24:29.875
Okay, go.

24:30.375 --> 24:31.375
Wait.

24:37.125 --> 24:38.125
Take this.

24:41.750 --> 24:44.208
Wait!

24:44.333 --> 24:46.583
Hey! Percy!

24:46.833 --> 24:48.333
Percy, please!

24:48.500 --> 24:51.916
Percy, no!
Don't do this. They'll kill you.

24:51.916 --> 24:53.333
Poseidon's never helped me before.

24:54.833 --> 24:57.208
- He wasn't gonna start now.
- Percy!

24:59.375 --> 25:00.750
I would've never made it to Hades.

25:00.750 --> 25:03.416
Percy? Percy, please.

25:04.291 --> 25:05.500
But you can.

25:07.708 --> 25:08.750
And now you will.

25:09.083 --> 25:11.333
Percy!

25:12.625 --> 25:15.083
Percy, do you hear me?

25:15.083 --> 25:17.208
Percy, you can't do this on your own.

25:33.750 --> 25:35.708
This is the end, sweetheart.

25:36.583 --> 25:37.791
Don't fight it.

25:38.750 --> 25:40.500
You'll just make her angry.

26:55.083 --> 26:58.416
So unfair.
You never had a chance, did you?

27:00.833 --> 27:04.583
If only someone'd cared enough
for you to provide you with one.

27:59.916 --> 28:01.166
<i>You are frightened.</i>

28:03.791 --> 28:05.208
<i>It's all right, Percy.</i>

28:06.791 --> 28:09.000
<i>Your father sent me to tell you,</i>

28:09.833 --> 28:10.958
<i>it's all right.</i>

28:13.208 --> 28:15.500
<i>Just breathe.</i>

28:18.958 --> 28:20.250
<i>Your father is here.</i>

28:22.166 --> 28:24.791
<i>He's always been here.</i>

28:25.458 --> 28:27.500
<i>It is so hard for him to stand back.</i>

28:28.416 --> 28:30.000
<i>To see you struggle.</i>

28:30.291 --> 28:31.958
<i>It is so hard for us all.</i>

28:32.916 --> 28:33.958
<i>But he's here.</i>

28:34.791 --> 28:36.583
<i>And he's so very proud.</i>

28:39.416 --> 28:40.500
<i>Trust him.</i>

28:42.833 --> 28:44.708
<i>Trust yourself.</i>

28:46.958 --> 28:48.125
<i>Just...</i>

28:49.583 --> 28:50.708
<i>breathe.</i>

30:53.791 --> 30:55.958
<i>My mom told me
these stories all the time.</i>

30:57.166 --> 30:58.916
Percy, stand up. I mean it.

30:59.416 --> 31:01.625
<i>She said this is what the gods
are like to each other.</i>

31:03.041 --> 31:04.666
<i>This is the kind of family they are.</i>
