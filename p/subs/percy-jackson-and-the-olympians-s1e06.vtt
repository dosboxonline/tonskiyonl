Should've known the god of thieves
noticed his pocket getting picked.

22:37.666 --> 22:41.291
Back door to the Underworld, magic word,
map in the glove box.

22:41.708 --> 22:43.833
And he says we'll become travelers
once we're on the road.

22:44.583 --> 22:46.833
And then the car will take us
wherever we wish to go.

22:46.833 --> 22:49.958
So, one of us just has to drive it
out of the garage.

22:53.583 --> 22:56.500
Oh, I'm still not 100% sure
what we're doing here,

22:57.083 --> 22:59.041
- which seems disqualifying.
- Yeah.

23:00.625 --> 23:01.958
Yeah, sure, I mean...

23:02.208 --> 23:04.291
I killed the Minotaur on my first try, right?

23:05.083 --> 23:06.166
How hard could this be?

23:06.166 --> 23:07.625
- [tires screeching]
- [car crashing]

23:07.625 --> 23:09.208
[♪ adventurous instrumental music playing]

23:09.208 --> 23:10.875
My fault. That was me.

23:11.291 --> 23:12.833
How do you make it go backwards?

23:15.416 --> 23:16.458
[engine revving]

23:19.500 --> 23:20.666
You're doing great.

23:20.791 --> 23:22.333
Maybe try aiming for the middle.

23:22.583 --> 23:25.583
- [engine revving]
- [tires squealing]

23:25.708 --> 23:27.958
- [Grover grunts]
- Look, you're welcome to give this a try.

23:29.291 --> 23:30.666
[tires screeching]

23:34.916 --> 23:37.875
- [car horn blaring]
- [tires screeching]

23:38.583 --> 23:40.166
That guy didn't even slow down!

23:40.666 --> 23:42.125
[car horn honks]

23:42.291 --> 23:43.875
[Annabeth] Okay. Keep going.

23:44.083 --> 23:45.208
Up to the street.

23:45.583 --> 23:48.416
- [engine revving]
- [tires squealing]

23:51.875 --> 23:53.333
[brakes squealing]

23:56.708 --> 23:58.500
It's okay. You've got this.

23:58.500 --> 24:01.750
[♪ music intensifies]

24:12.291 --> 24:14.375

24:27.083 --> 24:28.083
[gasps]

24:34.958 --> 24:35.958

24:35.958 --> 24:37.833
- [truck horn honking]
- [brakes screeching]

24:38.041 --> 24:39.916
- [Annabeth shouts]
- [tires screeching]

24:46.041 --> 24:48.500
- [panting]
- [rain pattering]

24:48.666 --> 24:49.666
Where are we?

24:53.083 --> 24:54.125
Turn off the lights.

25:06.125 --> 25:08.625
[thunder rumbling]

25:12.708 --> 25:14.916
Percy, Annabeth, wait. You...

25:17.750 --> 25:19.166
You guys are my best friends.

25:19.416 --> 25:22.833
[♪ tender instrumental music playing]

25:23.041 --> 25:25.750
Little weird that I forgot
a lot more stuff than you guys did.

25:26.333 --> 25:27.583
Wonder what that's about.

25:29.208 --> 25:30.416
We weren't alone.

25:31.708 --> 25:33.875
It's easy to forget what's important
when you're alone.

25:34.166 --> 25:37.958
[thunder rumbling]

25:45.666 --> 25:47.500
I think I gotta go meet my dad now.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.458
We'll be here when you get back.

25:56.166 --> 25:57.291
What do I say to him?

26:01.500 --> 26:02.500
You'll know.

26:10.458 --> 26:12.208
[♪ music becomes dramatic]

26:47.041 --> 26:50.750
[water echoing]

26:53.291 --> 26:54.833
[♪ ethereal instrumental music playing]

27:11.666 --> 27:12.708
I'm sorry.

27:13.375 --> 27:14.875
He waited as long as he could.

27:16.750 --> 27:19.458
The summer solstice
passed earlier this evening.

27:19.458 --> 27:21.250
Zeus's deadline has elapsed.

27:21.625 --> 27:25.208
Your father has gone to marshal his forces
and prepare for war.

27:26.208 --> 27:27.708
He asked that I relay a message.

27:29.833 --> 27:31.041
This is not your fault.

27:31.875 --> 27:32.958
You were brave.

27:33.833 --> 27:35.000
You were strong.

27:35.333 --> 27:37.583
You made your father proud.

27:41.166 --> 27:44.250
Now, it is time for you to return to camp.

27:44.250 --> 27:47.291
[♪ music concludes]

27:49.541 --> 27:50.541
No.

27:50.708 --> 27:52.416
[♪ wistful instrumental music playing]

27:53.458 --> 27:54.791
I'm going to see this through.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.666
You are released from your quest.

27:56.666 --> 27:57.833
I don't care.

27:58.750 --> 28:00.125
This is too important.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.583
The war is only the beginning
of Hades's plan.

28:03.875 --> 28:06.291
There's something else coming.
Something worse.

28:08.791 --> 28:11.291
My father doesn't know about this,
does he?

28:15.208 --> 28:16.541
I have to stop him.

28:17.625 --> 28:19.041
I have to keep going.

28:19.958 --> 28:22.750
If you can help, then you must help.

28:26.666 --> 28:27.833
So willful.

28:28.875 --> 28:29.916
Just like him.

28:33.750 --> 28:35.666
There is so much of him in you.

28:36.541 --> 28:37.541
We all see it.

28:39.583 --> 28:42.583
What belongs to the sea,
can always return.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.750
[♪ music swells]

28:51.083 --> 28:54.500
[Nereid] Each will provide one of you
safe passage back from the Underworld.

28:58.416 --> 28:59.625
There are four of them.

29:01.583 --> 29:02.666
Save the world...

29:03.791 --> 29:05.500
and then go save your mother.
