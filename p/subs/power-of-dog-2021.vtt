01:04.875 --> 01:06.416
<i>When my father passed,</i>

01:08.333 --> 01:10.875
<i>I wanted nothing more</i>
<i>than my mother's happiness.</i>

01:16.000 --> 01:19.083
<i>For what kind of man would I be</i>
<i>if I did not help my mother?</i>

01:21.416 --> 01:22.625
<i>If I did not save her?</i>

02:13.750 --> 02:14.833
You're not eating?

02:14.916 --> 02:15.750
No.

02:32.083 --> 02:34.333
Have you figured it out yet, fatso?

02:35.541 --> 02:38.333
-What?

02:38.416 --> 02:40.416
How many years
since we took over the ranch

02:40.500 --> 02:42.625
from the Old Gent and Old Lady?

02:44.333 --> 02:45.333
Why?

02:46.458 --> 02:47.958
Oh hell, think about it.

02:53.875 --> 02:55.875
You ever try the house bath, Phil?

02:59.125 --> 03:00.041
No, I have not.

03:03.291 --> 03:06.041
Early up tomorrow, brother.
Big old drive.

03:40.708 --> 03:43.166
There's a dead cow.
Keep our cattle away.

03:43.875 --> 03:46.583
-What happened?
-Anthrax. Don't touch.

03:50.750 --> 03:54.083
Well, guess this is it.

03:55.541 --> 03:56.458
What's "it," Phil?

03:58.416 --> 04:02.250
What's "it"? All right, fatso,
I'll tell you what "it" is.

04:03.750 --> 04:06.250
Twenty-five years
since our first run together.

04:07.916 --> 04:09.625
Nineteen hundred and nothing.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.916
That's a long time.

04:12.958 --> 04:14.208
Well, not too damn long.

04:23.583 --> 04:24.750
Know what we should do?

04:25.250 --> 04:26.666
What's that?

04:26.750 --> 04:30.125
Go camping again in the mountains
and shoot ourselves some fresh elk liver.

04:30.791 --> 04:34.583
Cook it right there on the coals
like Bronco Henry taught us.

04:39.458 --> 04:40.583
You got a sore gut?

04:41.875 --> 04:42.791
No.

04:43.291 --> 04:45.958
You act like it pains you
to hitch two words together.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.583
There'll be 12 for tonight.

05:44.166 --> 05:46.333
Do you what they'd prefer to eat?

05:46.416 --> 05:48.166
They like the fried chicken dinner.

05:58.416 --> 05:59.291
Yes?

05:59.375 --> 06:00.791
I'm going to need your room.

06:00.875 --> 06:01.875
All right.

06:08.083 --> 06:09.083
What are you doing?

06:09.875 --> 06:10.791
Nothing.

06:14.833 --> 06:15.833
Is that an album?

06:17.583 --> 06:18.666
Not really.

06:18.750 --> 06:20.583
-May I?
-Sure.

06:24.041 --> 06:26.958
-Do you like the mansion?
-Too much to clean.

06:27.541 --> 06:31.041
You wouldn't have to clean it.
There would be cleaners.

06:34.416 --> 06:35.583
Oh, she's beautiful.

06:37.250 --> 06:38.583
I like her flowers.

06:40.625 --> 06:43.208
Oh! That's clever, Peter.

06:45.833 --> 06:47.583
They're so lovely.

06:47.666 --> 06:48.708
Thanks.

06:50.666 --> 06:51.875
For the tables?

06:52.958 --> 06:53.958
Sure.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.541
-I need three chickens. Can you do them?
-All right.

07:00.958 --> 07:03.916
You're gonna have
to move your stuff to the shed.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I'll make a bed for you on the floor.

08:29.750 --> 08:30.583
Jake.

08:42.375 --> 08:44.208
-He there?
-Nope.

08:47.833 --> 08:51.375
Well, we can't wait forever.
The cattle are in the yards, so drink up.

08:52.208 --> 08:54.083
-You gonna say something?
-Nope.

08:55.291 --> 08:56.708
Not without my brother.

09:05.875 --> 09:06.875
Where were you?

09:07.458 --> 09:09.625
I couldn't make
the boys hold back forever.

09:09.708 --> 09:11.000
That's fine.

09:11.666 --> 09:12.791
Uh…

09:13.708 --> 09:16.875
Checked the power, and it's held up.
Not coming till morning.

09:18.750 --> 09:22.333
Oh, no, thanks. Phil, they're ready for us
next door at the Red Mill.

09:22.416 --> 09:23.625
Dinnertime, boys.

09:24.875 --> 09:26.250
Let's get a move on.

09:30.125 --> 09:33.708
Twenty-five years ago,
where were you, Georgie Boy?

09:33.791 --> 09:34.958
Hmm?

09:36.041 --> 09:37.458
-With you.
-I'll tell you.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.791
A chubby know-nothing
too dumb to get through college.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.291
People helped you, fatso.

09:44.375 --> 09:47.291
One person in particular
taught you and me ranching

09:47.375 --> 09:49.125
so we damn well succeeded.

09:55.291 --> 09:57.000
-Bronco Henry.
-Hmm.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.125
So…

10:03.291 --> 10:07.625
So, to us brothers, Romulus and Remus,
and the wolf who raised us.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.458
-Bronco Henry.
-Bronco.

10:09.541 --> 10:10.875
<i>-Il Lupo.</i>
-Bronco.

10:10.958 --> 10:13.333
-Bronco Henry.
-Bronco Henry.

10:17.666 --> 10:20.083
-Boss is leavin'.
-Dinner, boys.

10:29.291 --> 10:30.333
Much obliged.

10:36.416 --> 10:39.458
Rose? Rose, play piano for us please.

10:39.541 --> 10:40.708
I can't!

10:40.791 --> 10:43.416
-Play! Play! Play!
-Come on!

10:49.125 --> 10:51.458
-Is everything all right?
-Yes, ma'am. Fine.

10:51.541 --> 10:52.583
I can play the piano.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.041
Well, well…

11:12.041 --> 11:13.791
ain't them purdy.

11:24.125 --> 11:26.833
"I've never seen a woman
behind the wheel of a car."

11:37.041 --> 11:40.291
I said, "Have you never seen
a lady drive a car before?"

11:41.458 --> 11:43.000
He thought the dog was driving.

11:43.083 --> 11:44.500
No. No.

11:44.583 --> 11:46.083
-No!

11:46.666 --> 11:47.500
Oh, yeah.

11:48.250 --> 11:49.208
Well…

11:50.375 --> 11:54.333
I wonder what little lady made these.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.875
Actually, I did, sir.

12:02.041 --> 12:03.500
My mother was a florist.

12:04.333 --> 12:06.833
So I made them
to look like the ones in our garden.

12:07.333 --> 12:08.916
Oh, well, do pardon me.

12:11.583 --> 12:16.041
They're just as real as possible.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.083
Mmm.

12:23.208 --> 12:26.833
All right. Now, gentlemen, look.
See, that's what you do with the cloth.

12:33.625 --> 12:36.500
-It's really just for wine drips.
-Ooh, you got that, boys?

12:37.250 --> 12:39.666
Only for the drips.

12:44.708 --> 12:46.041
Now get us some food.

13:11.208 --> 13:14.416
-Did Bronco ever eat here?
-No, he did not.

13:15.166 --> 13:16.333
So where did you eat?

13:17.375 --> 13:21.750
Uh, back then we had herring at the saloon
and a whole lot of alcohol.

13:23.250 --> 13:24.083
Oh.

13:24.166 --> 13:28.125
I remember this one time, Bronco made
this wager that he could jump any horse

13:28.208 --> 13:32.000
over the tables and chairs of the saloon
piled up in the street.

13:33.375 --> 13:36.416
Well, we chose him a nag all right.

13:38.333 --> 13:39.500
It didn't bother him.

13:40.833 --> 13:42.291
He took off his saddle,

13:43.458 --> 13:45.916
walked the horse
up to the tables and chairs,

13:46.000 --> 13:47.500
talking to him all the while,

13:47.583 --> 13:50.791
stroking his big, ugly head
while the horse sniffed.

13:53.541 --> 14:00.083
And then he swung on
and rode him back and…

14:02.833 --> 14:03.833
What?

14:07.791 --> 14:08.625
Flew over.

14:08.708 --> 14:10.333
-He jumped it?

14:17.500 --> 14:20.541
But to get a nag to jump… ain't heard of.

14:22.416 --> 14:24.458
Put it down to <i>amour.</i>

14:27.500 --> 14:29.083
What do you say, George?

14:30.750 --> 14:31.750
<i>Amour?</i>

14:34.625 --> 14:38.125
What… I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:51.375 --> 14:53.500
Do you mind quietening? We're eating.

14:56.333 --> 14:58.541
Shut that down, or I will!

15:31.541 --> 15:33.166
Are you all right, Peter?

15:39.375 --> 15:40.375
Where are you going?

16:12.500 --> 16:14.416
Go on over. I'll settle up.

16:16.166 --> 16:17.416
Settle in the morning.

16:18.583 --> 16:19.833
I'll be along.

17:26.083 --> 17:28.750
Shall I settle up now, Mrs. Gordon, or…

18:15.250 --> 18:16.416
Please, you can…

18:18.416 --> 18:20.625
send the bill, and I'll post a check.

18:57.791 --> 18:59.666
Come over here. I love you.

19:39.791 --> 19:40.791
George?

20:41.666 --> 20:42.666
George?

21:07.083 --> 21:08.083
Brother.

21:10.375 --> 21:12.583
Where have you been?

21:17.000 --> 21:20.250
What you said about her boy tonight, Phil…

21:22.291 --> 21:23.750
made her cry.

21:28.291 --> 21:30.125
She had her ear to the door?

21:33.375 --> 21:34.833
She was crying, Phil.

21:36.250 --> 21:37.333
What the hell?

21:38.791 --> 21:42.500
I said her boy needed
to snap out of it and get human.

21:46.291 --> 21:47.958
Pointed it out, that's all.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.375
She should damn well know.

22:25.375 --> 22:26.458
Hold it.

22:31.375 --> 22:33.500
He's got it!

22:33.583 --> 22:35.250
He was better before.

22:35.750 --> 22:37.083
He's getting there.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.333
Is that how Bronco Henry learned it?

22:43.000 --> 22:45.708
I never saw him out on a lunge,
that's a fact.

22:59.375 --> 23:01.625
What is it
you see up there, Phil?

23:02.666 --> 23:03.958
Are animals up there?

23:04.750 --> 23:07.166
Has anyone else seen
what you've seen, Phil?

23:09.291 --> 23:10.208
George?

23:14.708 --> 23:16.333
Nah, not him.

23:19.750 --> 23:21.375
Come on, Phil. What is it?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.750
There is something there, right?

23:25.958 --> 23:27.833
Not if you can't see it, there ain't.

23:31.833 --> 23:33.291
Gotta be an animal.

24:23.875 --> 24:25.250
Hello, Mr. Burbank.

24:25.916 --> 24:27.083
Hello, Mrs. Gordon.

24:28.125 --> 24:29.458
How can I help you?

24:32.250 --> 24:35.958
I really just came to see you.

24:38.958 --> 24:39.875
Oh.

24:40.458 --> 24:41.750
I'm quite busy.

24:58.791 --> 25:02.041
"This most wholesome sauce is excellent

25:02.875 --> 25:06.166
with meats, fish, and cheese."

25:10.333 --> 25:11.666
They have wine with them.

25:12.375 --> 25:13.833
I wish they wouldn't do that.

25:13.916 --> 25:15.625
I don't like drinking.

25:16.500 --> 25:19.583
I'd say they have more in them than wine.
Sounds like booze.

25:20.166 --> 25:21.250
They're early.

25:21.333 --> 25:23.541
I should have never put
the pianola in there.

25:34.750 --> 25:37.291
-Here's the water.

25:42.291 --> 25:47.708
I see… I see the Herndon doctor
and the undertaker, Mr. Weltz.

25:47.791 --> 25:50.541
Oh, goodness.
I wish Peter were here.

25:51.041 --> 25:54.750
He should be serving the salad,
and I need to fry the chicken.

25:55.625 --> 25:58.000
Sometimes if you get food on the table…

25:59.833 --> 26:01.208
Um, Mr. Burbank,

26:02.291 --> 26:03.833
I'm gonna run and get Peter.

26:14.583 --> 26:15.708
Afternoon!

26:19.500 --> 26:22.916
-Uh, looks like I'm the new waiter.

26:24.750 --> 26:25.791
Doctor.

26:26.375 --> 26:27.583
Mr. Burbank.

26:29.333 --> 26:30.333
Mr. Weltz.

27:18.958 --> 27:21.166
Run into any snow down below?

27:23.500 --> 27:24.875
None to speak of.

27:29.041 --> 27:32.208
Well, I guess I'll roll me a smoke
since I'm woke up.

27:39.416 --> 27:40.500
How far did you get?

27:42.458 --> 27:45.833
Beech. That's where I aimed for.

27:46.958 --> 27:47.958
Beech?

27:49.500 --> 27:51.833
Whatcha doin' down there, Georgie Boy?

27:53.041 --> 27:54.333
Little tomcatting?

27:59.416 --> 28:01.458
I was speaking to Mrs. Gordon.

28:06.166 --> 28:07.416
Oh, yes.

28:08.791 --> 28:10.708
She cried on your shoulder.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.166
So she did.

28:16.291 --> 28:17.458
Give her half a chance,

28:17.541 --> 28:21.166
and she'll be after some dollar
for Miss Nancy's college fee.

28:29.666 --> 28:32.541
Remember how the Old Lady
brought those girls out to the ranch

28:32.625 --> 28:34.583
as soon as we could get hard-ons?

28:35.416 --> 28:37.375
Oh my God.

28:39.083 --> 28:41.500
Remember the tomato soup queen?

28:46.541 --> 28:48.833
Wasn't it her that wrote you,

28:49.708 --> 28:52.791
"I always will remember the western moon"?

28:57.041 --> 28:59.833
Well, guess you coulda taken her out

28:59.916 --> 29:02.583
without first putting
a sack over her head.

29:03.708 --> 29:05.291
Unlike some others.

29:19.041 --> 29:20.666
Well, night, Phil.

29:31.250 --> 29:33.375
It's a piece of ass
you're after, fatso,

29:33.458 --> 29:36.208
I'm damn sure
you can get it without a license.

29:46.083 --> 29:47.083
Hold it.

30:06.583 --> 30:08.125
What do you do with these?

30:13.208 --> 30:14.208
Goddamn.

30:15.166 --> 30:16.875
Do you cut 'em up or something?

30:30.500 --> 30:32.541
George has…

30:32.625 --> 30:33.750
He's gone again?

30:34.708 --> 30:39.375
…got himself… tangled

30:39.458 --> 30:45.458
with a suicide… widow…

30:50.625 --> 30:56.500
…and her half-cooked son.

31:09.375 --> 31:11.208
A little desk for your big desk.

31:18.791 --> 31:19.750
Phil.

31:19.833 --> 31:21.958
Yep, got you, old-timer.

31:23.041 --> 31:26.833
-Did you write to the Old Lady?

31:29.375 --> 31:31.000
Yeah, I dropped 'em both a line.

31:32.875 --> 31:34.791
Did you say something about Rose?

31:36.750 --> 31:37.958
Yeah, Rose…

31:38.041 --> 31:41.791
Well, you know as well as I do
what the Old Lady would feel

31:41.875 --> 31:47.083
if she thought
you were getting mixed up with her.

31:50.291 --> 31:51.958
She'd likely have a hemorrhage.

31:53.083 --> 31:59.125
The Old Lady would feel
as one Mrs. Burbank would feel

32:00.375 --> 32:01.791
for another Mrs. Burbank.

32:03.083 --> 32:04.166
Come again?

32:06.541 --> 32:08.000
We were married Sunday.

32:10.208 --> 32:12.375
She got rid of her property in Beech.

32:36.666 --> 32:37.583
Quit it.

32:39.166 --> 32:41.000
Stand steady, you little bitch, huh?

32:41.916 --> 32:43.125
-Come on.

32:43.875 --> 32:47.666
Look at me, you little bitch!
Huh? Yeah?

32:48.833 --> 32:51.541
Quit it! You fat-faced bitch!

32:54.125 --> 32:55.125
Whore!

33:02.291 --> 33:05.375
My school boarders eat dinner
at 6:00 p.m. sharp.

33:05.458 --> 33:07.958
No dish-washing duty if he has homework.

33:08.833 --> 33:11.291
Oh. No shoes inside.

33:16.333 --> 33:19.041
Maybe you'd like to come
to the ranch sometimes?

33:19.125 --> 33:20.375
Won't that be nice?

33:21.000 --> 33:23.208
May I keep
some of these rose petals?

33:36.166 --> 33:37.416
Hey, ho.

33:37.500 --> 33:38.750
Take the rest for later.

33:56.750 --> 34:00.708
I've been thinking
we should have some sort of dinner party

34:00.791 --> 34:02.541
to introduce you to my parents.

34:05.041 --> 34:09.416
And perhaps we could invite
the governor and his wife too.

34:10.500 --> 34:13.291
I saw them in Herndon today, and, uh,

34:14.500 --> 34:17.041
I… I kind of already mentioned it to them.

34:19.208 --> 34:24.416
Uh, maybe you'd be kind enough
to play something on our old piano.

34:26.333 --> 34:28.291
But, George, I'm not very good.

34:29.125 --> 34:31.958
-I only played for the moving pictures.

34:32.833 --> 34:36.041
You are plenty fine enough for us.

34:38.333 --> 34:41.333
The Old Lady can't play a note,
so…

34:42.125 --> 34:43.625
If that's what you want.

34:48.083 --> 34:49.541
This looks like a good spot.

34:50.041 --> 34:51.625
Pull over here, please.

34:51.708 --> 34:53.291
A good spot for what?

35:17.166 --> 35:18.875
You are marvelous, Rose.

35:30.125 --> 35:31.541
Stand beside me, George.

35:36.166 --> 35:37.833
What's happening?

35:37.916 --> 35:39.083
Follow me.

35:40.166 --> 35:41.166
Left foot forward.

35:41.958 --> 35:45.833
One, two, three. And to the side.

35:45.916 --> 35:49.083
One, two, three. And back.

35:49.166 --> 35:52.541
One, two, three.

35:53.791 --> 35:56.833
-To the side again. One, two…
-Sorry, I… I really can't.

35:58.958 --> 36:02.208
-I really can't dance. I…
-You're dancing.

36:03.416 --> 36:05.166
Here. This foot forward.

36:07.625 --> 36:08.625
Don't think.

36:10.458 --> 36:12.750
One, two, three. To the side.

36:12.833 --> 36:15.166
One, two, three. And back.

36:15.250 --> 36:17.500
One, two, three.

36:17.583 --> 36:19.416
I told you I'd teach you.

36:27.833 --> 36:30.458
Forward, two, three.

36:30.541 --> 36:31.875
Side, two…

36:48.125 --> 36:49.291
What is it, George?

36:56.333 --> 36:58.375
I just…

37:00.291 --> 37:02.375
I wanted to say how nice it is

37:04.041 --> 37:05.416
not to be alone.

37:52.583 --> 37:54.208
Go on up and get out of the cold.

38:14.708 --> 38:15.791
Hello, Phil.

38:16.958 --> 38:18.416
You remember Rose?

38:19.375 --> 38:21.416
-Oh, hello there.
-Hello.

38:22.708 --> 38:25.583
-Something wrong with the furnace?
-Search me.

38:28.666 --> 38:31.875
-I'll go down and shake it up.
-I've been hanging around for you all day.

38:31.958 --> 38:34.541
There's a deed
the Old Gent wants sent to him.

38:36.541 --> 38:38.583
Well, I figure that can go till morning.

38:39.416 --> 38:41.958
-You all right?
-I'm perfectly fine, George.

38:59.916 --> 39:01.375
Well, brother Phil,

39:03.291 --> 39:04.791
we had such a nice trip--

39:04.875 --> 39:06.083
I'm not your brother.

39:06.833 --> 39:08.375
You're a cheap schemer.

39:27.958 --> 39:29.916
"We had such a nice trip."

40:02.916 --> 40:04.125
Come on in.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
This is the bathroom.
Just make yourself at home.

40:18.166 --> 40:19.125
Yeah, that's fine.

40:19.916 --> 40:20.833
All right.

41:07.208 --> 41:08.291
Mm-hmm.

43:52.291 --> 43:54.791
Now, you just make yourself comfortable.

43:57.708 --> 44:00.166
Now, I'm going to bring you a surprise.

44:01.000 --> 44:01.916
What is it?

44:03.208 --> 44:05.208
Well, then it won't be a surprise.

44:24.541 --> 44:27.708
When the rains come,
the cellar gets flooded.

44:27.791 --> 44:32.916
So, the rats all drown.
They float to the surface.

44:33.000 --> 44:37.041
I have to get the young lads in
to scoop 'em all up with a…

44:47.750 --> 44:49.333
Please keep talking.

44:50.375 --> 44:51.375
Don't mind me.

44:52.541 --> 44:53.625
I like to keep busy.

45:08.666 --> 45:09.666
Easy.

45:11.208 --> 45:12.333
We got it.

45:12.416 --> 45:13.791
Head to the right.

45:17.500 --> 45:20.458
-Turn it around that way.
-Please, I'll take it.

45:22.416 --> 45:24.708
-What is it?
-Head to the front door.

45:25.208 --> 45:27.125
George. Is that…

45:28.083 --> 45:29.583
Is that a grand?

45:29.666 --> 45:31.583
-You got it?
-Yeah, I got it.

45:31.666 --> 45:36.083
-Whoa, hold it.
-It's a Mason & Hamlin baby grand.

45:36.625 --> 45:39.000
Oh no, it's… it's too good for me. I'm…

45:39.583 --> 45:42.541
I'm just very average.
I… I only know tunes.

45:43.375 --> 45:44.958
That's what I want, tunes.

45:45.583 --> 45:46.875
The governor too.

45:47.708 --> 45:50.791
We don't want a concert.
We just wanna hear you play, Rose.

45:51.875 --> 45:54.875
-I should like to look on the governor…
-Easy.

45:54.958 --> 45:58.416
…as he drives up
and gets out of his vehicle.

46:00.125 --> 46:02.958
-One step at a time, ready?
-Two, three, four.

49:28.875 --> 49:32.958
-You make a rope with these?
-These strips? Yeah.

49:48.541 --> 49:50.416
You boys find something needs doing.

49:51.375 --> 49:53.416
Yes, sir.

50:04.458 --> 50:07.500
I just came over to speak about something.

50:17.500 --> 50:19.625
Come on, partner.
Open your talker. What is it?

50:24.750 --> 50:30.750
His Nibs will be here for dinner
and the Old Gent and the Old Lady.

50:32.541 --> 50:34.666
Well, sir, ain't we going into society.

50:39.791 --> 50:41.500
She on the pinano again?

50:43.333 --> 50:44.750
Setting your teeth on edge?

50:47.500 --> 50:49.458
No. Uh…

50:50.416 --> 50:52.625
No, I… I like to hear Rose play.

50:54.875 --> 50:55.833
Hmm.

51:01.083 --> 51:02.541
Well, old-timer, what is it?

51:02.625 --> 51:03.708
What's in the noodle?

51:06.375 --> 51:07.375
Well…

51:08.791 --> 51:11.625
Phil. I, uh…

51:14.916 --> 51:17.291
-I just…
-Go on, spit it out.

51:17.375 --> 51:21.375
-Well, it's about His Nibs, the governor.
-All right.

51:22.000 --> 51:22.958
And, uh…

51:24.333 --> 51:27.000
Well, it's not so much about His Nibs

51:28.291 --> 51:32.458
but His Nibs' wife, actually, uh…

51:34.500 --> 51:39.041
I was thinking His Nibs
probably wouldn't mind so much,

51:40.875 --> 51:43.333
but his missus might.

51:43.916 --> 51:45.416
What, for dear Christ's sake?

51:46.666 --> 51:49.875
Well, it's sort of a hard thing…

51:51.583 --> 51:52.583
…to say.

51:52.666 --> 51:53.750
Uh…

51:57.833 --> 52:01.041
She might mind if you come
to the table without a washup.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
Yeah.

52:29.041 --> 52:31.208
Hello, Mother, Father.

52:31.291 --> 52:32.250
Hello.

52:35.750 --> 52:37.583
The car's around the side.

52:37.666 --> 52:38.916
Is there anyone with you?

52:40.166 --> 52:41.250
My wife.

52:48.958 --> 52:54.041
The napkin is fanned, so…

52:57.333 --> 52:58.875
Light the fire.

52:58.958 --> 53:00.333
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

53:00.416 --> 53:02.375
We may as well try and warm this place.

53:04.125 --> 53:05.916
Water, white wine…

53:08.458 --> 53:11.291
Use your hand. Use your hand like so.

53:12.583 --> 53:13.875
They're here.

53:24.625 --> 53:27.208
You keep warm. I can bring them in.

53:52.666 --> 53:56.000
Oh, how sweet.
They have their own umbrella.

53:56.083 --> 53:59.416
-Orange blossoms.
-It's an island of civilization here.

53:59.500 --> 54:00.333
Mmm.

54:00.416 --> 54:03.875
I was, uh, telling Georgie
about your brother.

54:03.958 --> 54:06.125
Phi Beta Kappa at Yale, wasn't it?

54:06.208 --> 54:08.541
Yes, in classics.

54:09.458 --> 54:10.458
That's right.

54:11.208 --> 54:15.458
So, uh… he swears at the cattle
in Greek or Latin?

54:22.333 --> 54:23.333
Yeah.

54:25.375 --> 54:30.125
Uh, Rose plays the piano very well.

54:30.708 --> 54:31.708
Do you?

54:32.500 --> 54:33.916
That's a nice surprise.

54:43.416 --> 54:46.708
I'll just go have a look-see
out the back for Phil.

54:47.375 --> 54:49.291
Oh, good. I want to meet this brother.

54:50.291 --> 54:51.291
Yes.

54:52.750 --> 54:55.250
I suppose
there was some sort of an injury.

54:55.333 --> 54:57.041
Oh, Edward, Georgina.

54:57.125 --> 54:59.833
Ah! Here are two people we can't fool.

54:59.916 --> 55:03.583
Oh no, you cannot. We know everything.
We're walking encyclopedias.

55:03.666 --> 55:05.875
At least I am.
I have nothing to do but read.

55:05.958 --> 55:08.958
She's been reading
"The Curse of Tutankhamun" in <i>The</i> <i>Digest.</i>

55:09.041 --> 55:11.291
So, uh, you believe in the curse?

55:11.375 --> 55:14.416
Oh, no, no, I'm not drinking
George's concoction.

55:14.500 --> 55:18.333
Yes, I do. But did you know
that Tutankhamun was just a boy?

55:18.416 --> 55:19.291
Only 18.

55:31.541 --> 55:32.958
Phil, are you here?

55:42.583 --> 55:43.750
I was looking for you.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.458
Well, you found me.

55:50.333 --> 55:52.958
Everyone's here.
And we're just about to eat.

55:54.333 --> 55:56.125
They're asking after you.

55:58.041 --> 55:59.000
Really?

55:59.916 --> 56:02.708
Yes, we're counting on your conversation.

56:08.625 --> 56:11.750
I shouldn't have said
what I said to you about--

56:11.833 --> 56:15.166
You two can keep your apologies
to yourself. I'm not coming.

56:17.166 --> 56:18.750
And what will I say?

56:20.250 --> 56:23.458
The Old Lady wants to see you too.
She's come a long way.

56:23.541 --> 56:24.958
You can tell them the truth.

56:25.916 --> 56:29.083
That I stink and I like it.

56:31.833 --> 56:34.000
Nothing could have happened
to Phil, could it?

56:34.083 --> 56:37.958
No, he'll be fine.
Something just must've come up.

56:40.625 --> 56:41.791
So, Rose…

56:44.166 --> 56:45.625
are you going to play for us?

56:45.708 --> 56:48.208
Yes, George told me
you play very well.

56:48.291 --> 56:51.083
-Oh no, I'm terribly out of practice.
-Yes, we'd love that.

56:51.791 --> 56:54.500
Come now, you've been playing a lot.

56:54.583 --> 56:55.666
You know you have.

56:56.750 --> 56:58.458
I don't know what to play.

56:59.041 --> 57:00.333
Why,

57:00.416 --> 57:01.583
play the one I like.

57:03.625 --> 57:07.583
-What one?
-Why, the… the one about the Gypsy.

57:07.666 --> 57:09.708
I… I can't seem to remember that one.

57:13.416 --> 57:16.416
Just play anything.

58:07.583 --> 58:08.833
I'm so sorry.

58:10.291 --> 58:12.166
I can't seem to play.

58:13.083 --> 58:17.083
I… I played in a cinema pit
for hours and hours.

58:17.166 --> 58:19.750
I'm… I'm so sorry.

58:20.791 --> 58:24.291
Well, she got you halter trained,
right, George? That's the main thing.

58:24.375 --> 58:26.000
-I'm so sorry.

58:26.083 --> 58:28.666
No, it was a lovely, lovely evening.

58:28.750 --> 58:29.583
Thank you.

58:39.875 --> 58:41.791
Oh, you're Phil.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.791
So, you weren't eaten by a cougar.

58:46.125 --> 58:47.041
Not yet.

58:47.541 --> 58:49.708
I am sorry
to have missed your conversation.

58:49.791 --> 58:51.208
I've heard you're brilliant.

58:51.291 --> 58:54.458
You're gonna want to keep your distance.
I'm just off the horse.

58:55.625 --> 58:57.208
Anyhows, you don't want conversation.

58:57.291 --> 59:00.166
You've been listening to the pinano
and dancing, I guess.

59:03.208 --> 59:04.291
You dance?

59:10.083 --> 59:11.958
You didn't play?

59:13.416 --> 59:15.375
You sure did practice a terrible lot.

59:17.750 --> 59:19.875
See, you wouldn't think
there was much difference

59:19.958 --> 59:22.333
between a cinema pit and a dinner party.

59:22.416 --> 59:23.916
Where have you been, Phil?

59:25.375 --> 59:27.291
I could hardly eat worrying about you.

59:28.458 --> 59:31.041
I didn't get washed up, so I didn't come.

59:31.125 --> 59:32.666
You didn't wash?

59:35.583 --> 59:39.333
Oh, he's a ranchman, isn't that right?
That's honest dirt.

59:42.375 --> 59:43.833
-Thank you, again.
-Thank you.

59:54.916 --> 59:57.875
I'll just run and grab you
a blanket for the ride.

1:00:15.416 --> 1:00:16.875
All right, goodbye.

1:00:53.333 --> 1:00:55.166
I wondered
if you didn't think about

1:00:55.250 --> 1:00:57.583
leaving your medical books here
for the summer.

1:00:58.708 --> 1:01:03.125
I thought about it, but…
but you understand they were Dad's.

1:01:03.875 --> 1:01:04.875
Turn around.

1:01:07.916 --> 1:01:08.958
Are you eating?

1:01:12.333 --> 1:01:13.333
I made a new friend.

1:01:14.250 --> 1:01:16.041
He calls me Doctor,
and I call him Professor,

1:01:16.125 --> 1:01:17.916
'cause that's what we wanna be.

1:01:19.208 --> 1:01:21.458
Why don't you invite your friend
to the ranch?

1:01:21.541 --> 1:01:22.708
No, Rose.

1:01:23.958 --> 1:01:24.875
Why not?

1:01:26.250 --> 1:01:27.375
Thank you.

1:01:27.458 --> 1:01:29.583
I don't want him to meet a certain person.

1:01:34.333 --> 1:01:35.708
A bull calf, boss!

1:01:35.791 --> 1:01:38.416
Keep that leg stretched out!
You got him?

1:01:40.250 --> 1:01:41.583
Grab his head!

1:01:42.166 --> 1:01:43.541
I got it! I got it!

1:01:53.666 --> 1:01:55.500
How come
you don't wear gloves?

1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:57.791
How 'bout
'cause they're not needed.

1:02:04.333 --> 1:02:07.208
Castrate 1,500 head,
then nick your thumb on the last.

1:02:10.708 --> 1:02:13.625
Well, fatso, I think we're finished.

1:02:22.166 --> 1:02:23.166
Who's that?

1:02:25.708 --> 1:02:27.083
Miss Nancy.

1:02:28.208 --> 1:02:29.458
Our waiter?

1:02:29.541 --> 1:02:31.333
Yep, that's him.

1:02:32.958 --> 1:02:36.000
You're gonna see him
creeping all over the place now.

1:02:36.083 --> 1:02:37.875
Big eyes goggling.

1:02:42.708 --> 1:02:44.875
Little Lord Fauntleroy.

1:03:01.916 --> 1:03:03.041
Rose?

1:03:05.083 --> 1:03:06.541
Does he like his room?

1:03:07.041 --> 1:03:07.958
Mm-hmm.

1:03:09.250 --> 1:03:10.166
I think so.

1:03:11.875 --> 1:03:14.041
Watch your fires. Summer's coming.

1:03:15.166 --> 1:03:18.750
Which also means any Indians camping
need to be moved off the property.

1:03:18.833 --> 1:03:20.000
No exceptions.

1:03:20.666 --> 1:03:23.791
-We got animals they want to eat. Got it?

1:03:23.875 --> 1:03:25.375
Yes, sir.

1:03:25.458 --> 1:03:26.875
We don't sell hides.

1:03:28.166 --> 1:03:29.916
We don't sell anything here.

1:03:50.083 --> 1:03:52.125
Keep your eyes and ears open.

1:03:52.208 --> 1:03:55.000
Maybe find yourselves
an arrowhead up by them aspens.

1:04:38.041 --> 1:04:39.041
Rose?

1:04:41.500 --> 1:04:42.916
I have a headache.

1:04:48.750 --> 1:04:49.750
Have a seat.

1:04:54.916 --> 1:04:56.666
I'm not eating tonight.

1:04:56.750 --> 1:05:02.166
It's George's week in town,
so it's just Phil.

1:05:03.458 --> 1:05:04.625
Mm-hmm.

1:05:06.875 --> 1:05:08.458
I made a trap.

1:05:08.541 --> 1:05:11.291
Oh no. It's… it's not a snake, is it?

1:05:15.583 --> 1:05:16.958
It's a bunny.

1:05:17.625 --> 1:05:19.333
Oh. Oh!

1:05:19.416 --> 1:05:21.458
You're okay.

1:05:26.875 --> 1:05:28.750
No, no, it's scared.

1:05:28.833 --> 1:05:30.291
-Come here.
-Get it, Peter.

1:05:30.375 --> 1:05:32.750
Come here. Come here. Come here.

1:05:34.750 --> 1:05:35.708
Bring him to me.

1:05:37.208 --> 1:05:38.166
Aw.

1:05:52.291 --> 1:05:53.708
Don't worry about him.

1:05:55.750 --> 1:05:57.166
You can eat in your room.

1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:02.833
They dug up that graveyard
to make way for the new highway.

1:06:03.916 --> 1:06:06.750
Among those buried there
was a friend of mine.

1:06:06.833 --> 1:06:11.500
A clumsy tractor driver
broke open the coffin,

1:06:12.041 --> 1:06:17.208
and they found her hair
had continued to grow after her death.

1:06:18.875 --> 1:06:24.000
The whole coffin just stuffed
with her lovely golden hair.

1:06:25.125 --> 1:06:27.250
Except for a few feet from the end,

1:06:28.791 --> 1:06:30.041
where it was gray.

1:06:34.250 --> 1:06:35.500
Can I take it up?

1:06:35.583 --> 1:06:37.583
-Some say she was a beauty.
-What?

1:06:37.666 --> 1:06:39.875
Golden braids
on top of her hair.

1:06:39.958 --> 1:06:42.500
Oh! Yes, go and see. It's very sweet.

1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:52.708
-No, please. Get out of my room.
-Where's your rabbit?

1:06:57.708 --> 1:06:58.833
I got it a carrot.

1:06:59.625 --> 1:07:00.708
It doesn't want one.

1:07:01.833 --> 1:07:02.833
Why?

1:07:08.250 --> 1:07:09.333
Holy hell.

1:07:18.041 --> 1:07:19.583
Shut the door.

1:07:32.333 --> 1:07:35.000
Now, even if you're happy
being in your room all day,

1:07:35.500 --> 1:07:36.416
it's good for me.

1:07:37.208 --> 1:07:39.000
-Mom, I have a lot to do.
-Come on.

1:07:40.333 --> 1:07:41.333
Peter…

1:07:43.291 --> 1:07:44.708
I thought you liked rabbits.

1:07:46.750 --> 1:07:48.416
Yes. I do.

1:07:50.208 --> 1:07:52.666
But if I want to be a surgeon,
I have to practice.

1:07:55.041 --> 1:07:58.041
Well, you're not to kill them
in the house, Peter.

1:07:58.875 --> 1:08:00.500
No, I'm putting my foot down.

1:08:02.833 --> 1:08:05.375
Oh, where'd a man be
if he always did what his mother told him?

1:08:05.458 --> 1:08:06.458
I'll score.

1:08:11.333 --> 1:08:12.375
Whoa!

1:08:12.958 --> 1:08:14.208
Point to Mrs. Burbank.

1:08:15.833 --> 1:08:17.083
I know, Lola. You don't have to…

1:08:18.375 --> 1:08:21.416
You don't have to narrate it.
I'll just… remember.

1:08:27.458 --> 1:08:30.250
-Whoo!
-Yeah, that was definitely out.

1:08:45.416 --> 1:08:48.708
Lola, can you please take over?
I have a migraine.

1:08:49.541 --> 1:08:50.541
Yeah.

1:08:51.500 --> 1:08:53.291
-Where do you want me?
-Back there.

1:08:53.375 --> 1:08:54.291
Yes, ma'am.

1:08:54.375 --> 1:08:55.875
-I hit that way.
-I was aiming for you.

1:08:55.958 --> 1:08:57.291
Don't listen to Bobby.

1:08:57.375 --> 1:08:58.708
Are you all right, Mother?

1:08:58.791 --> 1:09:01.833
I feel like my eyes
are going to pop out of my head.

1:09:11.750 --> 1:09:12.958
It's Phil, isn't it?

1:09:15.583 --> 1:09:16.500
He's cold.

1:09:16.583 --> 1:09:19.541
He's just a man, Peter, only another man.

1:09:21.333 --> 1:09:22.333
You go ahead.

1:11:04.041 --> 1:11:06.166
Yeah? You want 'em off, do you?

1:11:06.250 --> 1:11:07.916
-You want 'em off?

1:11:09.125 --> 1:11:09.958
Yeah, come on.

1:11:10.041 --> 1:11:11.666
Yeah, you want 'em?

1:11:11.750 --> 1:11:13.500
Yeah, you got 'em!

1:16:38.166 --> 1:16:40.416
Get out of here, you little bitch!

1:16:40.500 --> 1:16:41.333
You hear me?

1:16:44.625 --> 1:16:46.375
Get out of here!

1:17:15.500 --> 1:17:16.666
I know you. Good worker.

1:17:34.791 --> 1:17:36.791
-Jesus.

1:17:37.291 --> 1:17:39.416
You boys wanna eat,
come get it now.

1:17:43.500 --> 1:17:45.041
Whoa, whoa.

1:18:03.958 --> 1:18:06.041
No one tell him to soak those jeans?

1:18:11.708 --> 1:18:12.833
Howdy, ma'am.

1:18:18.833 --> 1:18:20.541
-Little faggot.

1:18:27.250 --> 1:18:28.500
Little Nancy.

1:18:56.708 --> 1:18:57.708
Pete.

1:18:58.833 --> 1:18:59.875
Hey, Pete.

1:19:02.125 --> 1:19:03.041
Peter.

1:19:08.416 --> 1:19:09.916
You want me, Mr. Burbank?

1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:15.250
Well, I don't see
any Mr. Burbank here.

1:19:16.666 --> 1:19:17.916
I'm Phil.

1:19:18.750 --> 1:19:19.791
Yes, Mr. Burbank.

1:19:19.875 --> 1:19:23.041
I guess it's hard for a young'un like you
to call an old fella like me

1:19:23.125 --> 1:19:26.166
just plain Phil, at first.

1:19:28.375 --> 1:19:30.041
Now come and take a look at this.

1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:35.333
Have you done any braiding
or plaiting yourself, Pete?

1:19:37.666 --> 1:19:40.166
No, I never have, sir.

1:19:45.083 --> 1:19:49.250
Peter, we kind of got off
on the wrong foot.

1:19:50.875 --> 1:19:53.333
-Did we, sir?
-Forget the "sir" stuff.

1:19:54.500 --> 1:19:56.250
That can happen to people.

1:19:57.875 --> 1:20:00.250
People who get to be good friends.

1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:03.875
Well, you know what?

1:20:03.958 --> 1:20:05.833
What? What, Phil?

1:20:08.875 --> 1:20:11.166
Now, you see? You did it.

1:20:12.166 --> 1:20:13.291
You called me Phil.

1:20:15.291 --> 1:20:19.250
I'm gonna finish this rope and give it
to you and teach you how to use it.

1:20:20.125 --> 1:20:23.500
Sort of a lonesome place out here, Pete.

1:20:24.416 --> 1:20:26.333
Unless you get in the swing of things.

1:20:27.291 --> 1:20:29.458
Thank you… Phil.

1:20:31.958 --> 1:20:34.541
How long do you expect it would take
to finish that rope?

1:20:34.625 --> 1:20:37.375
I could get it finished
before you go back to school.

1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:42.166
Well…

1:20:43.791 --> 1:20:45.458
It won't be very long then, Phil.

1:21:52.166 --> 1:21:53.166
Get on it.

1:21:54.708 --> 1:21:56.000
You can sit on it, Pete.

1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:01.250
Get yourself used to it.

1:22:04.250 --> 1:22:05.458
You got any boots?

1:22:06.666 --> 1:22:08.708
-Yes.
-You should wear 'em.

1:22:11.250 --> 1:22:13.375
Don't let your mom make a sissy of you.

1:22:24.166 --> 1:22:25.541
That's impressive, Phil.

1:22:26.041 --> 1:22:29.166
Well, just by sitting there,

1:22:29.250 --> 1:22:32.875
you're soaking up all the riding know-how
you'll ever need and then some.

1:22:33.666 --> 1:22:35.708
That saddle belonged to Bronco Henry.

1:22:37.416 --> 1:22:38.875
Greatest rider I ever knew.

1:22:46.708 --> 1:22:53.083
There's a cliff way out back of the ranch
with initials and 1805 carved into it.

1:22:53.166 --> 1:22:56.250
Must have been some fella
from the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

1:22:58.833 --> 1:23:00.750
They were real men in those days.

1:23:03.541 --> 1:23:06.333
Let's say just you and me
go out for a couple of days.

1:23:06.416 --> 1:23:08.708
Find those trails
and follow them to the end.

1:23:11.416 --> 1:23:14.541
Wouldn't be surprised if there were gold

1:23:15.458 --> 1:23:18.000
or precious minerals in them there rocks.

1:23:21.916 --> 1:23:24.291
Do many of the calves
die from wolves?

1:23:27.333 --> 1:23:33.416
There's always a few that get…
tore up or hamstrung or die of anthrax.

1:23:33.500 --> 1:23:34.375
Call it blackleg.

1:23:34.458 --> 1:23:37.625
You know, you talk like a Victrola record.
You know that?

1:23:37.708 --> 1:23:40.375
No, I didn't know.

1:23:40.958 --> 1:23:42.291
Yeah, well, you do.

1:23:51.708 --> 1:23:54.708
-Did Bronco Henry teach you to ride, Phil?
-Yep.

1:23:57.750 --> 1:24:01.541
He taught me to use my eyes
in ways that other people can't.

1:24:04.500 --> 1:24:06.000
Take that hill over there.

1:24:12.041 --> 1:24:14.166
Most people look at it
and just see a hill.

1:24:15.375 --> 1:24:18.041
Where Bronco looked at it,
what do you suppose he saw?

1:24:22.375 --> 1:24:23.375
A barking dog.

1:24:25.166 --> 1:24:28.166
-The hell, you just saw that now?
-No.

1:24:29.416 --> 1:24:30.666
When I first came here.

1:24:31.458 --> 1:24:35.458
See, it looks like a dog
with its jaw wide open.

1:24:38.333 --> 1:24:39.833
You… you just saw that?

1:24:41.291 --> 1:24:42.125
Yeah.

1:24:46.500 --> 1:24:48.166
-Peter.

1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:51.000
Peter.

1:24:53.416 --> 1:24:55.458
Can't you come in and talk for a little?

1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:11.416
You've gotten to be quite friendly
with Phil, haven't you?

1:25:16.208 --> 1:25:17.625
Is he nice to you?

1:25:20.208 --> 1:25:21.541
He's making a rope for me.

1:25:23.291 --> 1:25:24.375
Making a rope?

1:25:27.166 --> 1:25:29.875
Peter, I wish you wouldn't make that sound
with your comb.

1:25:33.416 --> 1:25:34.500
I wasn't aware.

1:25:34.583 --> 1:25:36.333
When I was little, I…

1:25:36.416 --> 1:25:40.625
I felt a chill in my spine when I heard
the chalk squeak on a blackboard.

1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:46.208
Oh, Miss…
Mrs. Merchant, that's who it was.

1:25:47.541 --> 1:25:52.375
She… she drew chalk stars
by our names on the blackboard.

1:25:54.750 --> 1:25:56.916
I wonder why it was stars she gave us.

1:25:58.416 --> 1:26:02.083
Why not diamonds? Why not hearts?

1:26:03.125 --> 1:26:05.708
Why not spades? Why…

1:26:09.875 --> 1:26:13.375
I wonder why it was always stars.

1:26:14.916 --> 1:26:17.208
Because stars are supposed
to be unreachable.

1:26:20.375 --> 1:26:21.375
Yes.

1:26:22.416 --> 1:26:25.666
But they weren't unreachable
because she gave them to us.

1:26:30.083 --> 1:26:31.791
-And, Peter?
-Hmm?

1:26:31.875 --> 1:26:36.541
We had this valentine box,
and it was covered with white crepe paper.

1:26:38.416 --> 1:26:41.125
And we would paste big, red hearts on it.

1:26:42.583 --> 1:26:44.416
Lopsided hearts.

1:26:44.500 --> 1:26:46.333
And you had a great many valentines.

1:26:50.416 --> 1:26:51.666
A great many?

1:26:55.833 --> 1:26:57.125
Because you're beautiful.

1:27:08.166 --> 1:27:10.458
Is there a sound that makes you shiver?

1:27:19.750 --> 1:27:20.958
I don't remember.

1:27:24.333 --> 1:27:25.833
We're not unreachable.

1:27:30.833 --> 1:27:31.916
Hey.

1:27:33.333 --> 1:27:36.750
No, we're not unreachable.

1:27:36.833 --> 1:27:39.250
Mother, you don't have to do this.

1:27:40.666 --> 1:27:43.208
I'll see you don't have to do it.

1:28:00.291 --> 1:28:02.333
-This his first week?
-Nope, third.

1:28:02.416 --> 1:28:03.375
Third?

1:28:04.666 --> 1:28:06.208
Open up the gate. Let him out.

1:28:06.291 --> 1:28:08.333
-You sure? He's not ready.
-Go on. Let him out.

1:28:16.041 --> 1:28:18.791
-Yeehaw, cowboy! Whoo!

1:28:18.875 --> 1:28:19.833
There you go!

1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:22.708
Grab her by the reins!

1:28:23.875 --> 1:28:25.791
-What you doing?
-Going to give him a hand.

1:28:25.875 --> 1:28:26.875
Don't.

1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:30.291
-Let him figure it out.
-Oh, oh!

1:28:30.375 --> 1:28:31.375
Or not.

1:28:33.833 --> 1:28:35.833
Fall off, you get back on.

1:28:37.291 --> 1:28:38.541
Get her over!

1:30:51.208 --> 1:30:53.625
Any happenings while I was away?

1:30:53.708 --> 1:30:55.250
Boys dug the ditch.

1:30:56.416 --> 1:30:57.916
Water's flowing good.

1:30:58.500 --> 1:31:00.041
Fixing that stack there.

1:31:00.125 --> 1:31:02.333
Hey, Pete!

1:31:02.416 --> 1:31:03.791
Come here.

1:31:07.333 --> 1:31:09.041
Peter? Peter?

1:31:11.416 --> 1:31:13.125
Where are you two off to?

1:31:14.208 --> 1:31:17.416
We're going to the far field
to fence off the stack there.

1:31:19.083 --> 1:31:20.083
Peter?

1:31:21.833 --> 1:31:23.208
-Rose?
-Peter!

1:31:25.666 --> 1:31:26.958
Rose, what's the matter?

1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:33.166
Rose?

1:31:33.250 --> 1:31:34.791
Can't Peter go with you today?

1:31:35.958 --> 1:31:39.208
Well, he could, but him and Phil
have kinda paired up.

1:31:39.291 --> 1:31:40.750
I don't want that.

1:31:40.833 --> 1:31:44.625
-I don't want him to be with Phil at all.
-But, Rose…

1:31:45.750 --> 1:31:49.166
He's helping him.
He taught him how to ride.

1:32:45.041 --> 1:32:46.208
Hey, Pete, my pal.

1:32:50.208 --> 1:32:51.625
Hey, Pete, my pal.

1:32:52.958 --> 1:32:53.958
You gonna help?

1:33:12.916 --> 1:33:15.125
You know who started riding
as late as you?

1:33:16.416 --> 1:33:18.750
-Who?
-Bronco Henry.

1:33:20.208 --> 1:33:22.833
Hadn't done any of it
till he was about your age now.

1:33:28.750 --> 1:33:30.166
Hello, Mr. Cottontail.

1:33:37.541 --> 1:33:40.416
Hey, Peter, let's see how long it takes

1:33:40.500 --> 1:33:43.166
before Mr. Cottontail
makes a run for the open.

1:33:44.333 --> 1:33:49.416
Now, as kids,
we used to take bets…

1:33:49.500 --> 1:33:51.416
…on how many poles we'd remove

1:33:51.500 --> 1:33:55.458
before the animals ran out
and made a run for it.

1:34:06.791 --> 1:34:08.000
Oh, he's still in there.

1:34:09.250 --> 1:34:10.583
Gutsy little bugger.

1:34:11.708 --> 1:34:13.083
I guess he has to be gutsy.

1:34:22.125 --> 1:34:23.750
Damn son of a bitch.

1:34:30.041 --> 1:34:32.250
Come on, now. Come on.

1:34:34.750 --> 1:34:35.958
Think it broke his leg.

1:34:37.666 --> 1:34:40.000
Well, put him out of his misery.

1:34:44.625 --> 1:34:45.666
Hmm.

1:34:47.625 --> 1:34:48.625
It's all right.

1:35:04.083 --> 1:35:05.250
That's deep.

1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:08.333
You okay, Phil?

1:35:08.416 --> 1:35:09.500
Yeah, what the hell?

1:35:11.500 --> 1:35:13.083
Must be a splinter.

1:35:31.083 --> 1:35:33.583
You got a tan.
That's a cowboy tan you got.

1:35:34.416 --> 1:35:35.250
Hmm.

1:35:40.875 --> 1:35:42.291
Bronco Henry told me that…

1:35:44.500 --> 1:35:47.208
a man was made
by patience and the odds against him.

1:35:52.375 --> 1:35:54.041
My father said…

1:35:56.041 --> 1:35:57.208
obstacles.

1:35:59.291 --> 1:36:01.041
And you had to try and remove them.

1:36:01.125 --> 1:36:02.458
Another way to put it.

1:36:04.500 --> 1:36:09.083
Well, you've certainly got obstacles.
That's a fact, Pete, me boy.

1:36:10.791 --> 1:36:12.958
-"Obstacles"?
-Well, take your ma.

1:36:14.250 --> 1:36:16.666
Today or any day…

1:36:18.833 --> 1:36:20.083
how she's on the sauce.

1:36:21.166 --> 1:36:22.375
"On the sauce"?

1:36:24.708 --> 1:36:25.708
Drinking, Pete.

1:36:26.708 --> 1:36:27.833
Boozing it up.

1:36:32.458 --> 1:36:34.500
I guess you know
she's been half-shot all summer.

1:36:34.583 --> 1:36:36.833
Yeah, I know.

1:36:39.750 --> 1:36:40.958
She never used to drink.

1:36:41.791 --> 1:36:44.166
-Oh, didn't she now?
-No.

1:36:45.666 --> 1:36:48.125
-She never did.
-But your pa, Pete?

1:36:49.875 --> 1:36:51.208
My father?

1:36:51.291 --> 1:36:52.500
Yeah, your father.

1:36:55.416 --> 1:36:57.458
I guess he hit the bottle pretty hard?

1:36:58.791 --> 1:36:59.791
The booze?

1:37:02.875 --> 1:37:04.291
Until right at the very end.

1:37:10.625 --> 1:37:11.708
Then he hung himself.

1:37:16.875 --> 1:37:18.125
I found him.

1:37:21.875 --> 1:37:22.875
Cut him down.

1:37:31.166 --> 1:37:33.208
He used to worry I wasn't kind enough.

1:37:36.958 --> 1:37:38.250
That I was too strong.

1:37:38.333 --> 1:37:39.750
You, too strong?

1:37:41.875 --> 1:37:43.041
He got that wrong.

1:37:45.250 --> 1:37:46.375
Poor kid.

1:37:51.916 --> 1:37:53.583
Things will work out for you yet.

1:38:05.208 --> 1:38:06.416
Where's Mrs. Lewis?

1:38:07.208 --> 1:38:08.416
She's with the Indians.

1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:12.125
What Indians?

1:38:14.041 --> 1:38:14.875
These ones.

1:38:14.958 --> 1:38:17.500
-You shouldn't even be here.

1:38:18.625 --> 1:38:19.750
He won't like it.

1:38:20.541 --> 1:38:21.791
Go now. Go.

1:38:26.625 --> 1:38:29.083
Water!

1:38:31.083 --> 1:38:34.291
They were standing right in front
of the damn things asking,

1:38:34.375 --> 1:38:36.333
"Do we have any hides?"

1:38:38.666 --> 1:38:41.958
"Do we have any hides?" Are they leaving?

1:38:43.833 --> 1:38:45.625
Yes, they've got their horse going.

1:38:46.416 --> 1:38:49.708
I told them
the hides are gonna be burned.

1:38:54.333 --> 1:38:55.416
Why?

1:38:56.041 --> 1:38:58.291
Why are the hides going to be burned?

1:38:58.375 --> 1:39:00.500
Phil doesn't want anyone else to have 'em.

1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:04.333
Waits till there's a big pile
and sets fire to the lot.

1:39:05.416 --> 1:39:08.000
He'd blow up
if they even touched 'em.

1:39:10.125 --> 1:39:11.125
What's she doin'?

1:39:28.750 --> 1:39:30.125
Please, please.

1:39:32.208 --> 1:39:33.833
Wait! Please!

1:39:36.625 --> 1:39:38.708
Wait! Please, stop.

1:39:39.583 --> 1:39:40.583
Please wait.

1:39:42.125 --> 1:39:43.125
Please.

1:39:44.125 --> 1:39:45.125
Come back.

1:39:45.958 --> 1:39:47.333
Take the hides.

1:39:47.416 --> 1:39:50.916
It would be my honor
if you would take them.

1:39:52.833 --> 1:39:53.833
Please.

1:39:55.041 --> 1:39:56.541
My husband owns the ranch.

1:39:59.541 --> 1:40:01.125
Come back. Take them.

1:40:32.625 --> 1:40:34.083
They're so soft.

1:40:36.416 --> 1:40:38.875
So deliciously soft.

1:40:41.125 --> 1:40:42.125
So beautiful.

1:41:07.958 --> 1:41:10.583
-You all right, ma'am?
-Is she breathing?

1:41:10.666 --> 1:41:11.583
Ma'am.

1:41:12.625 --> 1:41:13.958
-Ma'am.
-What happened?

1:41:14.458 --> 1:41:16.125
She just collapsed, sir.

1:41:19.708 --> 1:41:20.708
Rose?

1:41:42.333 --> 1:41:43.500
Sorry, sir.

1:41:44.875 --> 1:41:45.791
Thank you, Lola.

1:41:59.625 --> 1:42:00.500
Mine.

1:42:03.875 --> 1:42:05.666
-Almost done.
-Howdy.

1:42:05.750 --> 1:42:07.541
-Hey, boss.
-All right.

1:42:19.416 --> 1:42:20.708
I'll be damned.

1:42:32.666 --> 1:42:34.375
Is there something wrong, Phil?

1:42:34.458 --> 1:42:35.458
Wrong?

1:42:36.125 --> 1:42:37.791
For Christ's sake.

1:42:37.875 --> 1:42:40.500
Every goddamn hide is gone!

1:42:41.333 --> 1:42:43.958
Oh, she really put
her foot into it this time.

1:42:45.833 --> 1:42:47.041
You think she did it?

1:42:48.458 --> 1:42:50.208
-She sold them?
-Bloody tootin'.

1:42:51.500 --> 1:42:54.083
-Or maybe even gave them away.
-Why? Why?

1:42:54.166 --> 1:42:56.625
Why would she do that, Phil?
She knew that we needed the hides.

1:42:56.708 --> 1:42:58.625
Because she was drunk!

1:42:59.583 --> 1:43:02.166
Pie-eyed! She was smashed!

1:43:03.500 --> 1:43:05.500
I'd think you'd know
from the books your pa left you

1:43:05.583 --> 1:43:07.916
that your ma's got a… a whatchamacallit.

1:43:08.666 --> 1:43:12.500
Alcoholic personality.
It comes under the letter A!

1:43:19.958 --> 1:43:23.208
-You're not gonna say anything to her?
-Say anything?

1:43:23.291 --> 1:43:24.625
I won't say nothin'.

1:43:26.208 --> 1:43:29.416
But sure as one good hell,
brother George is going to.

1:43:38.875 --> 1:43:40.375
Rose is not well, Phil.

1:43:43.250 --> 1:43:44.166
She's ill.

1:43:46.791 --> 1:43:48.375
Not well?

1:43:50.208 --> 1:43:54.625
It is high time
that that bozo and you got next to a few…

1:43:54.708 --> 1:43:56.958
What do you ever call them? Facts!

1:43:57.041 --> 1:44:02.083
She stashes alcohol all around the place,
even drinking in the stinking alley.

1:44:04.708 --> 1:44:06.875
Look at your face in the mirror!

1:44:06.958 --> 1:44:11.375
Is it that she could like?
Or our money? Wake the hell up!

1:44:11.458 --> 1:44:12.541
That's enough, Phil.

1:44:17.833 --> 1:44:20.500
Well, what is the harm?

1:44:21.250 --> 1:44:23.208
The hides were only going to be burned.

1:44:24.083 --> 1:44:25.166
I needed them.

1:44:26.666 --> 1:44:28.250
I needed them.

1:44:30.166 --> 1:44:31.583
Well, I apologize.

1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:44.291
They were mine!

1:44:48.250 --> 1:44:49.250
I needed them!

1:45:05.458 --> 1:45:07.166
-Phil?
-Huh?

1:45:14.333 --> 1:45:15.333
Phil, I've…

1:45:17.625 --> 1:45:19.458
I've got rawhide to finish the rope.

1:45:22.083 --> 1:45:23.500
You've got it?

1:45:23.583 --> 1:45:25.541
What are you doing with rawhide?

1:45:26.041 --> 1:45:27.125
I cut some up.

1:45:28.500 --> 1:45:29.916
I wanted to be like you.

1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:33.458
Please take what I've got.

1:45:37.500 --> 1:45:38.708
Well…

1:45:38.791 --> 1:45:40.625
That's damn kind of you, Pete.

1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:57.208
Tell you something.

1:46:00.250 --> 1:46:03.750
Everything's gonna be plain sailing
for you from now on in.

1:46:07.500 --> 1:46:08.583
And you know what?

1:46:09.541 --> 1:46:10.541
I'm gonna work.

1:46:11.958 --> 1:46:13.583
Finish up that rope tonight.

1:46:16.958 --> 1:46:18.708
<i>You'll watch me do it?</i>

1:48:47.958 --> 1:48:50.083
How old were you
when you met Bronco Henry?

1:48:52.291 --> 1:48:53.708
About the age you are now.

1:49:04.250 --> 1:49:05.458
Was he your best friend?

1:49:06.833 --> 1:49:10.166
Yeah… he was.

1:49:11.625 --> 1:49:12.833
He was more than that.

1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:16.541
Once, he saved my life.

1:49:23.458 --> 1:49:27.583
We were way off up in the hills
shooting elk, and the weather turned mean.

1:49:30.083 --> 1:49:35.666
Bronco kept me alive
by… lying body against body in a bedroll.

1:49:39.291 --> 1:49:40.875
Fell off to sleep that way.

1:49:46.833 --> 1:49:47.833
Naked?

1:51:43.916 --> 1:51:46.375
-Phil left already?
-No, he's not here.

1:51:48.708 --> 1:51:50.416
He say he was settin' out early?

1:51:50.500 --> 1:51:51.500
No.

1:51:56.958 --> 1:51:58.083
Good mornin'.

1:51:59.208 --> 1:52:00.625
Have you seen your brother?

1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:04.416
He's not had breakfast?

1:52:06.458 --> 1:52:07.916
He's not been down at all.

1:52:11.375 --> 1:52:13.250
Can I get
some of that coffee please?

1:52:31.500 --> 1:52:33.708
I'll run you into Herndon
to see the doctor.

1:52:59.541 --> 1:53:00.458
Phil…

1:53:02.541 --> 1:53:04.083
what happened to your hand?

1:53:07.625 --> 1:53:08.958
Let's get your boots off.

1:53:19.875 --> 1:53:21.208
I'm… I'm good.

1:53:30.208 --> 1:53:31.625
I'll get the car.

1:54:37.666 --> 1:54:38.875
Let's go, Phil.

1:54:40.125 --> 1:54:41.291
Where's the boy?

1:55:04.875 --> 1:55:05.791
Phil.

1:55:15.333 --> 1:55:16.333
I'll get it to him.

1:56:09.708 --> 1:56:10.958
I'll take this one.

1:56:13.416 --> 1:56:14.250
Uh…

1:58:16.083 --> 1:58:22.666
Rose would like you to join us
for Christmas, if you care to.

1:58:26.458 --> 1:58:27.291
Yes.

1:58:28.416 --> 1:58:29.583
Thank you, George.

1:58:34.875 --> 1:58:36.208
I'm afraid I'm mystified.

1:58:37.166 --> 1:58:39.833
I'll know in a day or two
when the results come back.

1:58:40.666 --> 1:58:41.958
Those last convulsions…

1:58:44.333 --> 1:58:47.458
-Yes?
-Terrible, truly frightful.

1:58:49.458 --> 1:58:50.833
You know what I'm thinking?

1:58:51.750 --> 1:58:52.666
What?

1:58:53.750 --> 1:58:54.750
Anthrax.

1:58:59.458 --> 1:59:02.666
But he never handled diseased animals.

1:59:02.750 --> 1:59:04.458
He was particular on that.

2:00:01.041 --> 2:00:03.416
"Deliver my soul from the sword,

2:00:03.500 --> 2:00:05.625
my darling from the power of the dog."
