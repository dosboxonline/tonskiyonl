I did.

14:47.916 --> 14:49.041
But I had to come.

14:49.583 --> 14:51.375
I had to tell you who did steal it.

14:53.875 --> 14:55.000
It was Kronos.

15:05.541 --> 15:06.750
He's behind all of it.

He's emerging from Tartarus, or trying to.

is still here is because...

about her.

Did you?

You couldn't...

Clarisse didn't steal the bolt.

You did.

And you're certain
that you won't accept...

28:33.583 --> 28:34.958
an armed escort?

28:35.791 --> 28:38.083
I told you,
I don't think Luke wants to kill me.

28:38.666 --> 28:40.208
I don't think he does, either.

28:41.375 --> 28:42.666
That's what scares me.

28:43.750 --> 28:47.625
When Luke explained
why he planned to take down Olympus,

28:48.750 --> 28:50.916
part of it made sense to you, didn't it?

28:51.541 --> 28:52.541
Hmm?

28:53.208 --> 28:57.583
Luke knows that you'd be a powerful ally
to his cause.

28:58.333 --> 29:00.833
And his master, Kronos,

29:01.791 --> 29:04.250
he can be very, very persuasive.

29:04.250 --> 29:06.041
[♪ music continues]

29:06.291 --> 29:07.291
Yeah.

29:07.916 --> 29:09.875
But I'm very, very stubborn.

29:11.333 --> 29:12.791
You have to be very careful.

29:13.916 --> 29:15.375
You're more than a hero now.

29:16.416 --> 29:19.416
You are a leader
in the eyes of your fellow half-bloods.

29:22.791 --> 29:24.583
You have made me very proud.

29:27.791 --> 29:28.916
[Dionysus] Great.

29:29.875 --> 29:30.958
You're still here.

29:32.166 --> 29:33.333
I was just leaving.

29:34.333 --> 29:35.333
Thank you.

29:35.500 --> 29:36.916
No. Thank you, Percy.

29:39.041 --> 29:40.166
Wait. Percy?

29:41.666 --> 29:42.708
Yes?

29:42.708 --> 29:45.333
No. I mean, that's your name?

29:45.666 --> 29:47.750
- Yes.
- [Dionysus] Are you sure?

29:47.875 --> 29:50.708
- 'Cause I'm 90% sure it's Peter--
- Percy.

29:50.708 --> 29:52.125
[♪ tender instrumental music playing]

29:52.708 --> 29:53.916
Percy Jackson.

29:55.500 --> 29:56.541
I don't think so.

29:57.041 --> 29:58.583
I'm pretty sure I know my own name.

29:59.083 --> 30:01.291
Ah, you know what? I don't actually care.

30:01.750 --> 30:02.875
[shouting] Okay!

30:03.000 --> 30:06.750
For those of you
who are not staying for the full term...

30:07.291 --> 30:08.375
[shouting] ...get out!

30:09.125 --> 30:10.166
You get out.

30:10.583 --> 30:12.583
Pack your bags. You're going home.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
[♪ music continues]

30:20.041 --> 30:21.666
How does she feel about all of this?

30:23.916 --> 30:25.625
You going home to see your dad?

30:27.625 --> 30:29.208
It's a tree, Seaweed Brain.

30:29.791 --> 30:31.416
It doesn't express opinions.

30:33.541 --> 30:35.000
But I imagine she's thrilled.

30:36.708 --> 30:38.041
And how do you feel about it?

30:39.250 --> 30:40.666
[bird cawing]

30:41.833 --> 30:42.875
Well,

30:43.666 --> 30:47.000
he wants to show me New York City first,
so I'm gonna pretend I haven't been there,

30:47.333 --> 30:50.625
and then some place called Disney World,
which kinda sounds like Waterland

30:50.625 --> 30:52.541
but... less determined to kill you.

30:55.416 --> 30:56.625
Wait, did I read that wrong?

30:56.916 --> 30:58.041
What am I walking into?

30:58.750 --> 31:00.250
Is there something
you're supposed to do there?

Just...

31:06.666 --> 31:07.708
[Grover] Guys! Guys!

31:08.458 --> 31:09.500
You got it?

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Where is it?

[♪ music continues]

31:14.666 --> 31:16.166
Is that your Searcher's license?

31:16.583 --> 31:17.583
Yeah.

31:17.583 --> 31:19.958
Officially authorized
to begin the quest for Pan!

31:20.500 --> 31:22.083
- [♪ music becomes hopeful]
- Where are you gonna start?

31:22.208 --> 31:24.625
Well, it seems like every inch
of the natural world's

31:24.750 --> 31:26.375
been checked, noted, and footnoted.

31:27.125 --> 31:28.208
Then checked again.

31:28.208 --> 31:30.750
The Council's theory is that Pan
is always on the move,

31:30.875 --> 31:31.875
and it's all about timing.

31:32.041 --> 31:33.041
But...

31:33.500 --> 31:35.458
no one's ever bothered
to check the seas.

31:36.875 --> 31:38.708
I know some people in management
out there,

31:39.166 --> 31:40.416
if you ever need some help.

31:40.583 --> 31:41.583
I'll find you.

Right now.

No matter what happens,

31:56.250 --> 31:57.750
we meet back here next year.

31:58.833 --> 31:59.958
All of us.

It's a long story.

33:27.083 --> 33:28.083
But a good one.

It's time to wake up.

We're still doing this?

34:00.250 --> 34:02.500
I won. You lost.

Get out of my dreams already.

[Kronos, chuckling] Soon enough,
we'll meet in your world.

I'm pretty good at this.

So, when you are serious...

34:20.166 --> 34:21.250
come find me.

34:21.541 --> 34:24.416
[Kronos] That is my hope.

Probably would've helped
if I slept a little bit.

Did you have another nightmare?

- Grandpa.
- Oh.

Ugh. Don't call him that.

35:11.708 --> 35:13.041
All right.

35:13.041 --> 35:14.541
What did he say this time?

He said...

"Don't forget to tell your mom
