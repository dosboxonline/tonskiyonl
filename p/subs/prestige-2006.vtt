<i>[Man 1] Are you watching closely?</i>

01:00.642 --> 01:03.304
[Chirping]

01:05.713 --> 01:10.207
<i>[Man 2] Every magic trick consists</i>
<i>of three parts, or acts.</i>

01:10.285 --> 01:13.686
<i>The first part is called "the pledge."</i>

01:13.755 --> 01:17.122
<i>The magician shows you</i>
<i>something ordinary.</i>

01:17.192 --> 01:20.650
<i>A deck of cards, a bird or a man.</i>

01:25.433 --> 01:27.697
[Applause]

01:27.769 --> 01:29.703
<i>He shows you this object.</i>

01:29.771 --> 01:32.365
<i>Perhaps he asks you to inspect it,</i>

01:32.440 --> 01:35.466
<i>to see that it is indeed real,</i>

01:35.543 --> 01:38.603
<i>unaltered, normal.</i>

01:42.250 --> 01:45.151
<i>But, of course, it probably isn't.</i>

01:45.220 --> 01:47.017
Where do you think you're going?

01:47.088 --> 01:49.454
I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

01:53.761 --> 01:55.490
[Loud zapping]

02:02.370 --> 02:04.838
<i>The second act is called "the turn."</i>

02:04.906 --> 02:07.966
[Zapping]

02:19.320 --> 02:22.346
<i>The magician takes</i>
<i>the ordinary something</i>

02:23.958 --> 02:27.018
<i>and makes it do</i>
<i>something extraordinary.</i>

02:31.533 --> 02:35.629
<i>Now you're looking for the</i>
<i>secret, but you won't find it,</i>

02:35.703 --> 02:39.537
<i>because, of course,</i>
<i>you're not really looking.</i>

02:39.607 --> 02:41.234
<i>You don't really want to know.</i>

02:44.379 --> 02:46.870
<i>You want to be... fooled.</i>

02:48.550 --> 02:50.984
<i>But you wouldn't clap yet,</i>

02:51.052 --> 02:55.216
<i>because making something</i>
<i>disappear isn't enough.</i>

02:55.290 --> 02:58.885
<i>You have to bring it back.</i>

03:00.395 --> 03:04.161
<i>That's why every magic trick</i>
<i>has a third act.</i>

03:04.232 --> 03:05.893
<i>The hardest part.</i>

03:05.967 --> 03:08.492
<i>The part we call...</i>

03:08.570 --> 03:09.901
<i>..."the prestige."</i>

03:09.971 --> 03:12.906
[Muffled screaming]

03:20.682 --> 03:24.880
[Man] The prestige? And did Robert
Angier, the Great Danton, your employer,

03:24.953 --> 03:27.387
get to that final part
of his trick that night?

03:27.455 --> 03:29.548
- No, sir. Something went wrong.
- What went wrong?

03:30.725 --> 03:34.217
I saw someone making
their way below stage.

03:34.295 --> 03:36.195
I followed him.

03:36.264 --> 03:39.529
It was Borden,
watching Mr. Angier drown.

03:39.601 --> 03:43.037
Would you please describe
your occupation to the jury, Mr. Cutter.

03:43.104 --> 03:45.470
I'm an <i>ingénieur,</i> I design illusions

03:45.540 --> 03:48.703
and construct the apparatus
necessary for performing them.

03:48.776 --> 03:53.213
So, Mr. Cutter, was this
water-filled tank beneath the stage

03:53.281 --> 03:54.873
part of Mr. Angier's illusion?

03:54.949 --> 03:58.817
No. The tank was brought
on for the first trick

03:58.886 --> 04:00.854
and then taken offstage.

04:00.922 --> 04:04.221
Borden must have placed it
under the trap door after the end of it.

04:04.292 --> 04:05.850
How large was this tank?

04:05.927 --> 04:08.521
It's a normal tank
for escape under water,

04:08.596 --> 04:10.723
about 400 or 500 gallons.

04:10.798 --> 04:13.289
How do you think he
was able to move the tank

04:13.368 --> 04:15.734
under the trap door
without anyone noticing?

04:15.803 --> 04:18.168
- He's a magician, ask him.
- [Laughing]

04:18.238 --> 04:19.331
[Man] I ask again,

04:19.406 --> 04:22.638
would this man explain the mechanics
of Mr. Angier's illusion.

04:22.710 --> 04:26.043
The Real Transported Man is one
of the most sought after illusions

04:26.114 --> 04:27.308
in this business.

04:27.382 --> 04:28.940
I have the right to sell it on.

04:29.017 --> 04:31.645
If I reveal the method here,
the trick is worthless.

04:31.719 --> 04:33.983
How can we know
that the tank wasn't simply

04:34.055 --> 04:36.523
some part of the trick that went wrong?

04:36.591 --> 04:38.650
Mr. Cutter, I see your predicament.

04:38.726 --> 04:41.126
But Alfred Borden's life
hangs in the balance.

04:41.195 --> 04:44.358
If you were prepared to disclose
the details to me in private,

04:44.432 --> 04:47.265
I might be able to judge
their relevance to the case.

04:47.335 --> 04:49.963
Might this be an acceptable compromise?

05:08.256 --> 05:11.623
[Guard] I'm going to have to ask
you to turn out your pockets.

05:15.763 --> 05:19.324
Not my idea, sir. The warden saw
his show in Manchester last year

05:19.400 --> 05:21.265
where he vanished into thin air.

05:21.336 --> 05:23.827
He's convinced he'll try and escape.

05:23.905 --> 05:25.702
[Men shouting]

05:27.241 --> 05:30.039
I told him the only way
Borden's going to disappear

05:30.111 --> 05:32.545
is if I leave him out there
with the other inmates.

05:38.419 --> 05:39.750
Check the locks...

05:41.456 --> 05:43.014
...twice.

05:50.098 --> 05:52.623
My name is Owens.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.964
I'm a solicitor.

05:55.036 --> 05:58.699
I represent Lord Caldlow, an
accomplished amateur magician and...

05:58.773 --> 06:01.367
[Borden] How much?

06:01.442 --> 06:03.774
- He is interested...
- How much for my tricks?

06:03.845 --> 06:05.437
Five thousand pounds.

06:05.513 --> 06:08.004
Talk to Fallon, my <i>ingénieur.</i>
Money's for him.

06:08.082 --> 06:11.779
Yes, I did. He offered
to sell me your tricks.

06:11.853 --> 06:14.720
All except the most valuable
one, The Transported Man.

06:14.789 --> 06:18.088
Well, I won't forgive myself
for selling my greatest trick.

06:18.159 --> 06:19.592
Even for your daughter?

06:21.262 --> 06:25.596
If you are for the drop, your daughter
is going to need looking after.

06:25.666 --> 06:27.395
Fallon will take care of her.

06:27.468 --> 06:29.197
Perfect, Fallon.

06:29.270 --> 06:31.295
A man with a past
as obscure as your own.

06:31.372 --> 06:36.400
The courts have motioned she be removed
from his care. She will be an orphan.

06:36.477 --> 06:38.741
I know you're no stranger
to the workhouse.

06:39.514 --> 06:41.345
It's better than here?

06:41.416 --> 06:44.647
I'm offering you a way to wrap up
your affairs with dignity.

06:44.719 --> 06:46.687
I'm offering your daughter a future.

06:46.754 --> 06:49.780
As Lord Caldlow's ward,
she will want for nothing...

06:49.857 --> 06:51.688
...ever.

06:51.759 --> 06:54.751
Well, think it over.

06:54.829 --> 06:58.595
And Lord Caldlow
would like you to have this,

06:58.666 --> 07:01.191
as a show of good faith.
It might be of interest.

07:01.269 --> 07:04.796
Robert Angier's diary, including
the time he spent in Colorado

07:04.872 --> 07:06.134
learning your trick.

07:06.207 --> 07:07.902
- He never learned it.
- Really?

07:07.975 --> 07:11.502
On his return, he mounted
a version of The Transported Man

07:11.579 --> 07:15.538
that the papers said was
better even than your original.

07:15.616 --> 07:17.811
If you want Angier's secrets,

07:17.885 --> 07:22.447
you go dig him up and ask him yourself.

07:22.523 --> 07:24.388
I want your secret, Mr. Borden.

07:27.328 --> 07:28.761
Consider your daughter.

07:36.204 --> 07:38.172
<i>[Angier] A cipher,</i>

07:38.239 --> 07:40.264
<i>an enigma...</i>

07:42.176 --> 07:44.007
<i>... a search,</i>

07:44.078 --> 07:45.067
<i>a search for answers.</i>

07:52.753 --> 07:56.553
<i>Even if Colorado</i>
<i>is the end of my journey,</i>

07:56.624 --> 07:59.821
<i>it'll take much longer to unravel</i>

07:59.894 --> 08:01.794
<i>the rest of Borden's secrets.</i>

08:03.931 --> 08:05.831
<i>See, the cipher in his notebook is</i>

08:05.900 --> 08:08.391
<i>unlocked by a single word,</i>

08:08.469 --> 08:11.438
<i>but it will still take months</i>
<i>to translate his writing.</i>

08:11.506 --> 08:14.270
<i>And to know his mind.</i>

08:17.211 --> 08:19.543
<i>Well, my passion is equal to the task.</i>

08:32.626 --> 08:36.154
[Man] Mr. Angier, welcome
to Colorado Springs.

08:51.546 --> 08:54.606
- The whole town has electricity.
- Yes, sir.

09:11.799 --> 09:13.289
Well...

09:13.367 --> 09:14.857
...quite a reception.

09:14.936 --> 09:17.427
You're our first guest
of the season, Mr. Angier.

09:17.505 --> 09:20.997
Your telegram didn't indicate
how long you'd be staying with us.

09:21.075 --> 09:22.702
As long as it takes.

09:22.777 --> 09:26.042
I will need a coach tomorrow
to take me up the mountain.

09:26.113 --> 09:27.842
Well, the peak's closed, sir.

09:27.915 --> 09:29.746
For scientific experimentation.

09:29.817 --> 09:31.785
Yes, I know.

09:31.852 --> 09:33.149
That's why I'm here.

09:40.394 --> 09:42.624
Whoa. Whoa.

09:44.332 --> 09:47.267
[Driver] You'll have to walk
the rest, I'm afraid, sir.

09:59.180 --> 10:03.514
[Rumbling]

10:11.325 --> 10:14.817
[Rumbling continues]

10:17.565 --> 10:19.726
- [Electrical zapping]
- [Groans]

10:19.800 --> 10:22.792
[Door slams]

10:22.870 --> 10:26.033
[Man] I'm amazed how many
of you newspaper writers

10:26.107 --> 10:28.166
can't read my sign.

10:32.913 --> 10:35.507
Not the welcome I was expecting.

10:38.486 --> 10:40.545
I know you.

10:44.525 --> 10:46.049
You're the Great Danton.

10:46.127 --> 10:48.425
I saw your show in London.

10:48.496 --> 10:51.260
Seven times you guessed every object

10:51.332 --> 10:53.562
the audience had in their pockets.

10:53.634 --> 10:57.695
I'm Alley. Sorry about the fence.
People keep interfering with our work.

10:57.772 --> 11:00.434
- I've come to see Tesla.
- Why?

11:00.508 --> 11:04.569
He made a machine
for a colleague of mine some time ago.

11:04.645 --> 11:08.137
- Can you get me a meeting with him?
- Impossible, I'm afraid.

11:08.215 --> 11:10.445
I've brought a lot of money.

11:10.518 --> 11:12.179
I'm sorry, Mr. Angier.

11:13.254 --> 11:15.814
I simply can't help.

11:16.991 --> 11:20.119
I'll be staying
at the hotel, indefinitely.

11:23.464 --> 11:25.557
Hey, what am I holding?

11:25.633 --> 11:26.930
Your watch.

11:31.739 --> 11:35.231
<i>[Angier] Borden's journal</i>
<i>entry for April 3, 1897,</i>

11:35.309 --> 11:37.402
<i>describes a show</i>
<i>at the Orpheum Theatre.</i>

11:37.478 --> 11:40.379
<i>That was just days</i>
<i>after he first met me.</i>

11:43.117 --> 11:46.484
<i>[Borden] We were two young men</i>
<i>at the start of a great career,</i>

11:46.554 --> 11:48.886
<i>two young men devoted to an illusion,</i>

11:48.956 --> 11:51.516
<i>two young men who never</i>
<i>intended to hurt anyone.</i>

11:51.592 --> 11:53.355
[Man] Which of you brave souls

11:53.427 --> 11:56.157
is willing to bind
this lovely young woman?

11:56.230 --> 11:57.857
[Shouting]

11:57.932 --> 11:59.866
[Man] Me!

11:59.934 --> 12:02.835
- [Applause]
- [Drum taps]

12:08.342 --> 12:09.866
If you would tie her wrists,

12:10.478 --> 12:12.844
bind her feet...

12:12.913 --> 12:15.438
...around the ankle.

12:15.516 --> 12:17.609
Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?

12:17.685 --> 12:19.516
- No.
- No.

12:20.321 --> 12:23.415
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

12:31.432 --> 12:33.263
[Drum tapping continues]

13:01.195 --> 13:03.891
[Stopwatch ticking]

13:03.964 --> 13:07.627
[Drum roll]

13:16.944 --> 13:19.504
[Applause]

13:26.520 --> 13:30.115
He's complacent,
he's predictable, he's boring.

13:30.191 --> 13:32.751
Milton has gotten success,
whatever that means,

13:32.827 --> 13:36.058
so now he's scared.
He won't take any risks at all.

13:36.130 --> 13:39.190
He's squandering the goodwill
of his audience with tired,

13:39.266 --> 13:41.860
- second-rate tricks...
- They're all favorites.

13:41.936 --> 13:45.428
Give me something fresh.
He won't even try a bloody bullet catch.

13:45.506 --> 13:47.337
A bullet catch is suicide.

13:47.408 --> 13:51.401
All it takes is some smartass
volunteer to put a button in the barrel.

13:51.478 --> 13:53.742
- Use a plant.
- You can't for every trick.

13:53.814 --> 13:55.782
No seats left for the punters.

13:55.850 --> 13:59.650
All right, no bullet catch, whatever,
but the point is a real magician

13:59.720 --> 14:01.347
tries to invent something new

14:01.422 --> 14:04.289
that other magicians will
scratch their heads over.

14:04.358 --> 14:06.553
Then you sell it to him
for a small fortune.

14:06.627 --> 14:09.721
- What?
- I suppose you have such a trick?

14:09.797 --> 14:12.357
- I sure do.
- Would you care to sell it to me?

14:12.433 --> 14:14.025
No. No one else can do my trick.

14:14.101 --> 14:16.228
- Any trick can be duplicated.
- Wrong.

14:16.303 --> 14:20.034
If Mr. Borden has invented
his masterpiece,

14:20.107 --> 14:22.007
he's prepared to do it.

14:22.076 --> 14:24.203
Milton is a showman,
but Borden is right,

14:24.278 --> 14:25.905
he won't get his hands dirty.

14:25.980 --> 14:29.541
If you want to see what
it takes to make real magic,

14:29.617 --> 14:33.451
go to the Tenley. There's a Chinaman
there and he really has what it takes.

14:33.520 --> 14:35.750
- Chung Ling Soo.
- I can't afford that.

14:35.823 --> 14:37.552
I know the bloke run the door.

14:37.625 --> 14:41.959
You two go and see that show, and
whichever one of you can tell me

14:42.029 --> 14:45.123
how he does the goldfish bowl
trick gets the prize.

14:45.199 --> 14:47.463
- Which is?
- Ten minutes onstage

14:47.534 --> 14:49.365
with my old friend, Mr. Ackerman.

14:49.436 --> 14:50.869
- Really?
- Who's Ackerman?

14:50.938 --> 14:53.998
The top theatrical agent in London.

14:54.074 --> 14:57.066
- I saw you drop the knot again.
- [Woman] I turned my wrists.

14:57.144 --> 14:59.772
Some nights you
just don't get it, do you?

14:59.847 --> 15:02.714
I mean, if that knot slips
and Julia's on the hoist,

15:02.783 --> 15:03.875
she'll break her leg.

15:03.951 --> 15:05.578
It's the wrong knot.

15:05.653 --> 15:08.520
Like I said, the Langford
double will hold tighter.

15:08.589 --> 15:12.116
The Langford double isn't
a wet knot. It's too dangerous.

15:12.192 --> 15:14.422
If the rope swells, she can't slip it.

15:14.495 --> 15:17.726
- I can slip a Langford underwater.
- We can practice.

15:17.798 --> 15:21.734
- Borden, he said no.
- Oh, you know knots better than me?

15:21.802 --> 15:23.793
Listen, no more mistakes.

15:23.871 --> 15:26.567
All right. Yeah? Do you?
You want to take over?

15:26.640 --> 15:29.575
- Just leave.
- I didn't think so.

15:34.014 --> 15:35.845
Hey, Cutter, where's he from?

15:35.916 --> 15:39.215
Where are you from? He shifts
props for Virgil at the hall.

15:39.286 --> 15:42.449
- Worried he'll steal your tricks?
- Doesn't deal in methods.

15:42.523 --> 15:45.583
- How do you know?
- Because I hired him

15:45.659 --> 15:48.890
to find out how Virgil
does the orange trick.

15:48.963 --> 15:51.295
- I don't trust him.
- He's a natural magician.

15:51.365 --> 15:53.458
'Course you can't trust him.

15:53.534 --> 15:54.899
I think he's all right.

15:54.969 --> 15:57.301
- You think everyone's all right.
- Even you.

15:57.371 --> 16:01.205
Watch your sightlines. If I can see you
kiss your wife's leg every night,

16:01.275 --> 16:03.937
so can the blokes at the ends
of rows three and four!

16:18.225 --> 16:22.719
[Oriental-sounding guitar strumming]

16:23.664 --> 16:28.328
[Snare drum roll]

16:36.010 --> 16:38.444
[Angier] You're wrong. It can't be.

16:38.512 --> 16:42.243
- Look at the man.
- This is the trick.

16:42.316 --> 16:44.341
This is the performance. Right here.

16:44.418 --> 16:46.784
This is why no one
can detect his method.

16:48.555 --> 16:50.147
Total devotion to his art.

16:51.158 --> 16:52.887
A lot of self-sacrifice.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.326
You know.

16:55.396 --> 16:58.092
It's the only way to escape...

16:58.165 --> 17:00.599
...all this, you know?

17:04.371 --> 17:08.068
I can barely lift this thing
and it's not even filled with water.

17:09.710 --> 17:12.041
Or fish, look.

17:12.112 --> 17:14.376
I don't know. Hang on a second.

17:16.316 --> 17:19.012
He must be strong as an ox.

17:21.655 --> 17:24.488
He's been pretending
to be a cripple for years.

17:24.558 --> 17:28.153
Any time he's in public,
any time he goes out. It's unthinkable.

17:28.228 --> 17:31.163
Borden saw it at once.
But I couldn't fathom it.

17:31.231 --> 17:34.098
Living my whole life
pretending to be someone else.

17:34.168 --> 17:35.897
You are pretending.

17:35.969 --> 17:37.994
I don't think changing a name compares.

17:38.072 --> 17:40.540
Not your name. Who you are
and where you're from.

17:40.607 --> 17:44.566
I promised I wouldn't embarrass
my family with my theatrical endeavors.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.344
I thought of a name for you.

17:49.716 --> 17:53.208
- The Great Danton.
- [Chuckles]

17:53.287 --> 17:56.256
Do you like it? But it's sophisticated.

17:56.323 --> 17:57.756
It's French.

18:03.730 --> 18:07.894
<i>[Angier] Borden writes as if no one but</i>
<i>he understood the true nature of magic.</i>

18:13.540 --> 18:16.270
<i>But what does he know of self-sacrifice?</i>

18:21.381 --> 18:23.508
You bloody fool.

18:26.920 --> 18:29.047
[Applause]

18:51.078 --> 18:54.673
- [Whimpering] He killed it.
- It's OK.

18:54.748 --> 18:58.582
- He killed it.
- He didn't.

19:02.656 --> 19:04.351
Look, now he'll bring it back.

19:06.593 --> 19:09.528
- No, he killed it.
- No, he didn't.

19:11.865 --> 19:15.460
[Applause continues]

19:17.838 --> 19:20.807
Look, see, he's all right. He's fine.

19:20.874 --> 19:24.970
- Look at him.
- But where's his brother?

19:27.681 --> 19:30.946
He's a sharp lad, your son.

19:31.018 --> 19:33.612
Oh, he's my nephew.

19:33.687 --> 19:35.177
Ah.

19:35.255 --> 19:39.351
[Chirping]

19:39.426 --> 19:40.916
You're the lucky one today.

20:01.515 --> 20:04.678
Are you watching closely?

20:07.454 --> 20:08.944
Look closer.

20:12.025 --> 20:13.822
Never show anyone.

20:13.894 --> 20:16.624
They'll beg you
and flatter you for the secret,

20:16.697 --> 20:20.189
but as soon as you give it up,
you'll be nothing to them.

20:20.267 --> 20:22.531
You understand? Nothing.

20:22.603 --> 20:25.663
The secret impresses no one.

20:25.739 --> 20:29.334
The trick you use it for is everything.

20:33.580 --> 20:36.515
Well, thank you for lunch, Mr. Borden.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.073
You're welcome.

20:39.519 --> 20:41.180
Alfred, it's Alfred.

20:41.255 --> 20:42.847
Alfred.

20:42.923 --> 20:45.892
So I could use a cup of tea.

20:45.959 --> 20:49.486
I can't allow...
It's the landlord. It's not...

20:50.931 --> 20:54.162
You think that's...
Is that enough to keep me out?

20:54.234 --> 20:57.465
[Chuckling] I think so.

20:58.472 --> 21:00.064
So I'll see you again?

21:09.283 --> 21:11.774
Milk and sugar?

21:32.873 --> 21:34.841
What's in there?

21:34.908 --> 21:36.842
Angier's machine.

21:45.419 --> 21:47.046
You built this, Mr. Cutter?

21:47.120 --> 21:49.987
Oh, no, sir. This wasn't
built by a magician.

21:50.057 --> 21:52.082
This was built by a wizard.

21:52.159 --> 21:57.153
A man who can actually do
what magicians pretend to do.

21:57.230 --> 22:01.428
Tell me, Your Honor, what happens
with these things after the trial?

22:01.501 --> 22:03.469
They've been sold to a Lord Caldlow.

22:03.537 --> 22:06.301
An avid collector,
very interested in the case.

22:06.373 --> 22:08.864
Yeah. Well, don't let him take this.

22:08.942 --> 22:11.740
- Why ever not?
- It's too dangerous.

22:11.812 --> 22:13.973
I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles

22:14.047 --> 22:16.345
it's got a simple
and disappointing trick.

22:16.416 --> 22:18.850
The most disappointing of all, sir.

22:21.021 --> 22:22.716
It has no trick.

22:25.158 --> 22:26.750
It's real.

22:27.928 --> 22:29.793
[Scoffs]

22:29.863 --> 22:32.161
This is the tank Angier drowned in?

22:32.232 --> 22:34.291
Yes.

22:34.368 --> 22:36.529
This is the...

22:36.603 --> 22:39.663
...place where the performer's
hand reaches through

22:39.740 --> 22:41.002
to the trick padlock.

22:41.074 --> 22:43.338
A standard magical
apparatus for escapes?

22:43.410 --> 22:45.901
Yeah, with one important difference.

22:45.979 --> 22:48.004
This isn't a trick lock.

22:48.081 --> 22:50.049
It's been switched for a real one.

22:50.117 --> 22:52.085
What a way to kill someone.

22:52.152 --> 22:54.848
They're magicians, Your Honor.

22:54.921 --> 23:00.325
Showmen, men who live by dressing up
plain and sometimes brutal truths,

23:00.727 --> 23:03.491
to amaze, to shock.

23:03.563 --> 23:05.724
Even without an audience?

23:06.900 --> 23:08.868
There was an audience.

23:09.703 --> 23:11.762
You see, this water tank

23:11.838 --> 23:15.274
was of particular significance
to these two men.

23:16.576 --> 23:19.101
Particularly awful significance.

23:22.015 --> 23:27.009
[Milton] Which of you brave souls is
willing to bind this lovely young woman?

23:27.087 --> 23:29.521
[Drum taps]

23:29.589 --> 23:31.079
If you would tie her wrists,

23:31.158 --> 23:33.319
bind her feet around the ankle.

23:46.540 --> 23:49.134
- Are either of you gentlemen sailors?
- No.

23:49.209 --> 23:51.040
[Laughter]

23:51.111 --> 23:53.306
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

24:06.293 --> 24:08.193
[Milton claps]

24:25.212 --> 24:27.544
[Stopwatch ticking]

24:29.416 --> 24:33.352
[Drum roll]

24:47.334 --> 24:48.426
[Gasps]

24:48.502 --> 24:49.696
Robert!

25:11.858 --> 25:13.257
No, no.

25:17.230 --> 25:19.755
Julia. Julia!

25:45.725 --> 25:47.852
[Gasps]

26:04.444 --> 26:07.311
[Cutter] I knew an old sailor once.

26:07.380 --> 26:10.281
They told me he went overboard,

26:10.350 --> 26:12.443
tangled in the sails.

26:12.519 --> 26:14.316
They pulled him out,

26:14.387 --> 26:18.289
but it took him five minutes to cough.

26:18.358 --> 26:20.383
He said it was like...

26:20.460 --> 26:22.291
...going home.

26:27.634 --> 26:29.966
What do you want, Borden?

26:36.776 --> 26:38.801
I'm sorry for your loss, Angier.

26:42.616 --> 26:44.675
Which knot did you tie?

26:47.821 --> 26:50.756
I keep asking myself that.

26:50.824 --> 26:52.815
- And?
- And...

26:54.561 --> 26:57.428
I'm sorry, I just don't know.

26:59.499 --> 27:00.989
You don't know?

27:02.836 --> 27:04.770
I'm sorry.

27:05.739 --> 27:08.333
You don't know?

27:11.945 --> 27:14.140
You don't know?!

27:20.420 --> 27:23.753
- Alfred?
- Good news. We got our first booking.

27:24.224 --> 27:26.158
I don't think we've had the pleasure.

27:26.226 --> 27:29.252
- Mr. Fallon is my <i>ingénieur.</i>
- Where did you get all...?

27:29.329 --> 27:33.322
- I had to borrow and... don't ask.
- He's a very enterprising soul

27:33.400 --> 27:35.197
is... is Mr. Fallon. So...

27:35.268 --> 27:38.704
- We can't afford to pay him.
- The money will come with the audience.

27:38.772 --> 27:42.469
But what about until then?
What I earn, it's barely enough for us.

27:42.542 --> 27:46.501
Don't worry about it. I'll share
half my food with him or something.

27:46.579 --> 27:49.548
You're going to be
doing that with someone else.

27:49.616 --> 27:51.516
No. You're...

27:51.584 --> 27:53.848
Having a baby.

27:53.920 --> 27:56.821
Oh, my God.

27:56.890 --> 27:59.723
We should have told Fallon.
That is great.

27:59.793 --> 28:02.261
Oh, come here.

28:02.328 --> 28:05.297
[Chuckling] Oh.

28:05.365 --> 28:06.889
Alfred, what is this?

28:06.966 --> 28:11.130
Oh, this is just the trick to work
Ackerman up at the end of my act.

28:11.204 --> 28:13.900
Is it the masterpiece, the great trick?

28:13.973 --> 28:16.737
No, no, no, the world is
not ready for that one yet.

28:16.810 --> 28:21.144
This is just your run-of-the-mill,
daring, spectacular bullet catch.

28:21.214 --> 28:23.739
- A bullet catch.
- Yeah, but it's safe.

28:23.817 --> 28:26.115
I promise. Look.

28:28.488 --> 28:30.752
- Shoot me.
- Shoot you?

28:30.824 --> 28:32.052
Go on, shoot me.

28:34.561 --> 28:36.586
- Right there.
- No, I can't.

28:36.663 --> 28:39.223
No, no, not there.
Shoot me here. Don't...

28:43.470 --> 28:46.337
- [laughs]
- How's that?

28:46.406 --> 28:49.739
That's very good. Tell me how you do it.

28:49.809 --> 28:50.935
No, I can't do that.

28:53.012 --> 28:55.879
- Well, then you can't do it.
- I can't do it?

28:55.949 --> 28:59.282
I'm sorry, but I can't
raise a child on my own.

28:59.352 --> 29:01.684
You don't tell anybody that I told you.

29:01.755 --> 29:04.087
- OK.
- Gunpowder.

29:06.659 --> 29:07.785
Wadding.

29:09.429 --> 29:11.522
Then the bullet.

29:12.132 --> 29:13.861
Ramrod.

29:18.571 --> 29:20.562
Hold out your hand.

29:22.642 --> 29:26.578
The bullet is not even in the
gun when the charge is fired.

29:26.646 --> 29:30.412
Once you know,
it's actually very obvious.

29:31.484 --> 29:33.475
Well, I mean, you still get...

29:33.553 --> 29:35.145
It's dangerous.

29:35.221 --> 29:37.416
- People still get killed doing that.
- How?

29:37.490 --> 29:40.220
You get some smartass who
could put a penny or a button

29:40.293 --> 29:43.626
or, God forbid, Sarah, somebody
could put a bullet down there.

29:43.696 --> 29:46.893
Don't worry. Don't worry,

29:46.966 --> 29:50.231
because I'm not gonna let
anything happen.

29:50.303 --> 29:53.170
Everything's gonna
be all right because...

29:54.541 --> 29:57.806
...I love you very much.

30:00.446 --> 30:03.745
- Say it again.
- I love you.

30:04.818 --> 30:07.286
- Not today.
- What?

30:07.353 --> 30:10.516
Well, some days it's not true,
and today you don't mean it.

30:10.590 --> 30:13.821
Maybe today you're more
in love with magic than me.

30:13.893 --> 30:16.521
I like being able
to tell the difference.

30:16.596 --> 30:19.394
It makes the days it is true

30:19.465 --> 30:21.797
mean something.

30:23.436 --> 30:24.869
All right.

30:41.054 --> 30:43.784
[Booing]

30:43.857 --> 30:47.156
[Borden] Metal rings,
ladies and gentlemen.

30:47.227 --> 30:49.889
If there are any
ladies and gentlemen here.

30:49.963 --> 30:53.330
- Solid metal.
- [Man] Seen that already.

30:57.070 --> 30:59.061
[Booing]

31:03.977 --> 31:05.069
Who threw that?

31:08.982 --> 31:13.385
[Booing continues]

31:21.661 --> 31:23.458
This is what you came for, is it?

31:27.300 --> 31:28.790
So...

31:29.903 --> 31:31.803
...who wants to volunteer?

31:31.871 --> 31:33.634
- [Man] I do!
- [Man 2] Me!

31:33.706 --> 31:37.039
[Shouting]

31:41.381 --> 31:42.439
Me.

31:44.217 --> 31:46.276
Me.

31:50.790 --> 31:52.917
[Audience silent]

31:59.699 --> 32:02.190
Are you man enough, sir?

32:07.173 --> 32:09.004
Yes.

32:19.786 --> 32:21.845
Which knot did you tie, Borden?

32:28.061 --> 32:30.325
Which knot did you tie, Borden?

32:31.497 --> 32:33.192
I don't know.

32:35.969 --> 32:38.494
- [Gunshot]
- [Gasps]

32:38.571 --> 32:42.007
[Groaning]

32:48.748 --> 32:52.411
<i>[Borden] He came in to demand</i>
<i>an answer, and I told him the truth.</i>

32:52.485 --> 32:55.648
<i>That I have fought with myself</i>
<i>over that night,</i>

32:55.722 --> 32:59.055
<i>one half of me swearing blind</i>
<i>that I tied a simple slipknot,</i>

32:59.125 --> 33:02.492
<i>the other half convinced</i>
<i>that I tied the Langford double.</i>

33:02.562 --> 33:04.587
<i>I can never know for sure.</i>

33:07.533 --> 33:09.797
How can he not know!

33:09.869 --> 33:11.632
<i>[Angier] How can he not know?</i>

33:13.272 --> 33:15.763
<i>He must know what he did.</i>

33:15.842 --> 33:17.241
<i>He must.</i>

33:19.879 --> 33:21.870
Sarah, that bloody hurts.

33:22.582 --> 33:25.210
I don't understand
how it can be bleeding again.

33:25.284 --> 33:27.718
It's as bad as the day it happened.

33:29.455 --> 33:33.391
- We have to get a doctor back.
- We can't afford the doctor back.

33:33.459 --> 33:34.892
[Baby cries]

33:34.961 --> 33:38.556
- You've woken her.
- Great.

33:38.631 --> 33:41.532
I'm sorry, I need this to heal
so I can get back to work.

33:41.601 --> 33:45.367
You've got to face things. What tricks
can you perform with this injury?

33:45.438 --> 33:48.896
I can do car pulls.
I can do some prop tricks.

33:48.975 --> 33:53.344
I can still do that. I can do
the trick I've been telling you about.

33:53.413 --> 33:55.540
The one that they're
gonna remember me for.

33:57.917 --> 33:59.509
Come on.

34:25.078 --> 34:28.275
I never thought I'd find an answer
at the bottom of a pint glass.

34:28.347 --> 34:29.938
Hasn't stopped your looking.

34:35.154 --> 34:38.021
Heard about a booking.
Nice little theater.

34:38.091 --> 34:40.924
- Young, up-and-coming magician.
- Who?

34:40.993 --> 34:43.723
- You.
- Me? Booking? Why?

34:43.795 --> 34:45.889
I want to keep on working.

34:45.965 --> 34:49.196
Who's going to hire the <i>ingénieur</i>
that killed Julia McCullough

34:49.268 --> 34:51.395
in front of a sellout crowd
at the Orpheum?

34:52.170 --> 34:54.366
Someone who knows it wasn't your fault.

34:54.440 --> 34:57.932
Someone who knows Alfred Borden
and his repertoire of exotic knots.

34:58.010 --> 35:01.537
I hear he had a spot of bad luck
catching a bullet south of the river.

35:01.614 --> 35:04.412
That's a dangerous trick, that one.

35:09.622 --> 35:11.590
We'll have to whitewash the windows,

35:11.657 --> 35:15.354
confound the more curious
members of the public, but it will do.

35:15.428 --> 35:17.123
[Stomps on floor]

35:17.196 --> 35:20.825
- We should see about an assistant.
- I've made some arrangements.

35:21.734 --> 35:23.497
You settled on a name?

35:24.403 --> 35:26.064
Yes, I have.

35:26.139 --> 35:28.004
The Great Danton.

35:28.074 --> 35:30.599
It's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it?

35:32.011 --> 35:34.241
No, it's sophisticated.

35:34.313 --> 35:37.077
The birdcage can't be
our climax. Everybody knows it.

35:37.150 --> 35:39.550
- Not like this.
- I don't want to kill doves.

35:39.619 --> 35:41.484
Then stay off the stage.

35:41.554 --> 35:43.249
You're a magician, not a wizard.

35:43.322 --> 35:47.190
You got to get your hands dirty, if
you're going to achieve the impossible.

35:48.661 --> 35:51.027
In here, Miss Wenscombe.

35:51.097 --> 35:55.557
No point in meeting Mr. Angier
if you don't fit. On the right.

35:58.738 --> 36:00.763
- What's so hard about this?
- Nothing.

36:00.840 --> 36:03.365
You're going... down here.

36:03.442 --> 36:09.108
[Indistinct talking]

36:09.182 --> 36:12.049
- And this will conceal, right?
- Oh, sure.

36:12.718 --> 36:14.310
- Tighten up on there.
- Yep.

36:14.387 --> 36:15.411
OK.

36:17.523 --> 36:18.581
This ties up here?

36:18.658 --> 36:20.057
- Ties in the back.
- Good.

36:26.132 --> 36:28.327
Breathe as little as possible.

36:34.840 --> 36:37.468
Now, you see?

36:37.543 --> 36:38.942
- That's it.
- OK.

36:42.381 --> 36:44.212
She's not experienced,

36:44.283 --> 36:46.308
but she knows how to present herself.

36:46.385 --> 36:50.981
A pretty assistant is the most
effective form of misdirection.

36:51.057 --> 36:54.424
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen,
for my final trick,

36:54.493 --> 36:57.257
I will require the assistance
of two volunteers.

36:57.330 --> 36:59.594
Mr. Merrit, if you would oblige me?

37:01.500 --> 37:03.024
Yep.

37:04.837 --> 37:06.532
- Under?
- Under, yeah.

37:08.107 --> 37:09.404
Come around his foot.

37:09.475 --> 37:10.908
- Careful.
- It's all right.

37:27.360 --> 37:31.694
[Grinding]

37:31.764 --> 37:34.028
- Your volunteer, put their hand there.
- Yeah?

37:34.100 --> 37:35.931
And another one here.

37:36.002 --> 37:39.529
If you'll place your hands
on either side of the cage, please.

37:39.605 --> 37:40.936
Thank you, Olivia.

37:41.007 --> 37:44.773
You best not be intending
to hurt this animal, Mr. Angier.

37:44.844 --> 37:47.210
- Of course not.
- Ready? Right.

37:47.980 --> 37:50.778
- One...
- Two...

37:51.517 --> 37:52.779
Three.

37:56.789 --> 37:58.586
That's bloody marvelous, Cutter.

37:59.592 --> 38:00.786
Very nice.

38:00.860 --> 38:02.657
And the best part is...

38:05.398 --> 38:07.958
[chuckling]

38:08.034 --> 38:10.468
I thought you said I had
to get my hands dirty.

38:10.536 --> 38:12.436
Someday, perhaps you will.

38:12.505 --> 38:14.063
I just had to know that you can.

38:14.140 --> 38:16.074
Very nice. Very nice, indeed.

38:16.142 --> 38:19.805
I haven't had the chance to compliment
you on your beautiful theater.

38:19.879 --> 38:22.245
It'll be a lot more
beautiful when it's full.

38:22.315 --> 38:23.304
Don't worry.

38:23.382 --> 38:25.612
You all say that. Why should I worry?

38:25.685 --> 38:28.552
If your tricks don't get them
in, somebody else's will.

38:28.621 --> 38:32.717
Maybe somebody willing
to do a bullet catch or a water escape?

38:32.792 --> 38:34.350
Cheap thrills, Mr. Merrit.

38:34.427 --> 38:38.090
People hoping for an accident,
likely to see one too.

38:38.164 --> 38:40.155
What would that do for your business?

38:40.232 --> 38:43.099
[Chuckling] You got a week, John.

38:43.169 --> 38:46.536
- Thank you, Mr. Merrit.
- [Chuckles]

38:47.673 --> 38:52.303
[Up-tempo classical music]

38:54.513 --> 38:55.878
Thank you.

38:55.948 --> 38:57.609
- [Music ends]
- [Applause]

38:57.683 --> 39:01.312
Uh... Sir, in the third row there.

39:01.387 --> 39:04.083
Please stand up
and show us your handkerchief.

39:06.092 --> 39:07.889
- [Laughter]
- This isn't mine.

39:07.960 --> 39:11.418
Perhaps you'd return it to the lady
in the aisle of the second row.

39:11.497 --> 39:13.795
I believe she has yours.

39:13.866 --> 39:16.061
[Applause]

39:16.135 --> 39:20.071
[Up-tempo piano music]

39:20.139 --> 39:24.803
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm making
so many mistakes. I'm so nervous.

39:24.877 --> 39:27.141
The audience doesn't seem
to be responding.

39:27.213 --> 39:29.443
They've seen a lot of tricks before,

39:29.515 --> 39:32.006
but not this next one.

39:41.060 --> 39:42.823
Cloth over.

39:42.895 --> 39:44.658
Keep your fingers crossed.

39:44.730 --> 39:46.994
I'll have the champagne ready.

39:51.170 --> 39:54.105
[Applause]

39:55.174 --> 39:56.835
[Angier chuckles]

39:59.412 --> 40:01.403
[All groaning]

40:01.480 --> 40:04.779
- You've seen this one before?
- [Man] We've seen them all before.

40:04.850 --> 40:06.977
I'll make it a little
harder then, shall I?

40:07.052 --> 40:10.021
Two volunteers, please.
A lady and a gentlemen.

40:10.089 --> 40:13.286
To hold this cage with me.

40:13.359 --> 40:15.327
I'll perform this feat in a manner

40:15.394 --> 40:19.922
never before seen by yourselves or any
other audience anywhere in the world.

40:19.999 --> 40:22.331
[Drum roll]

40:22.401 --> 40:25.029
Madame, place one hand
on the back of the cage,

40:25.104 --> 40:26.628
one hand on the front.

40:26.705 --> 40:29.071
Sir, one hand on the bottom of the cage

40:29.141 --> 40:30.665
one hand on the top.

40:36.949 --> 40:39.281
- [Snapping]
- [Woman screams]

40:44.154 --> 40:47.055
- I should've spotted him.
- You had a lot of plates going.

40:47.124 --> 40:49.285
- Don't suppose we can do this again.
- No.

40:49.359 --> 40:51.793
- So, what's the climax of our show?
- Show?

40:51.862 --> 40:54.990
- You don't have a show.
- We have a week's engagement.

40:55.065 --> 40:58.660
To perform magic, not butcher birds
and break my customers' fingers.

40:58.735 --> 41:01.431
Clear out, anything here
in the morning gets burned.

41:01.505 --> 41:03.939
- Mr. Merrit...
- It's done, John.

41:04.007 --> 41:06.805
I've hired a comedian.
You know I hate comedians.

41:08.945 --> 41:11.436
[Cutter] Well, there's
plenty of good theaters.

41:11.515 --> 41:14.348
If we can come up with a new trick,

41:14.418 --> 41:17.649
- change the name of the act.
- The name stays.

41:19.489 --> 41:24.620
Right, well, then the new trick's
gonna have to be irresistible then.

41:24.695 --> 41:26.720
I have a couple of methods to try out.

41:26.797 --> 41:30.028
And then we need a new angle
on the presentation.

41:30.100 --> 41:31.931
And if you need some inspiration,

41:32.002 --> 41:35.165
there's a technical exposition
at the Albert Hall this week.

41:35.238 --> 41:37.968
Engineers, scientists, you know?

41:38.041 --> 41:41.340
That sort of thing captures
the public's imagination.

41:41.411 --> 41:45.438
[Thunder rumbling]

41:58.395 --> 42:01.796
Mind if I join you? Tesla sends
me down here during the storms.

42:01.865 --> 42:05.096
Perfect excuse to come join
the Great Danton for a drink.

42:06.069 --> 42:08.469
Two of them.

42:08.538 --> 42:11.166
Beautiful, isn't it?
God, I miss New York, though.

42:11.241 --> 42:13.675
- Why are you here?
- The lightning lives here.

42:13.744 --> 42:15.371
And not much else.

42:15.445 --> 42:16.969
Our work is secret.

42:17.614 --> 42:19.514
That a cipher?

42:21.618 --> 42:24.746
A rotating transposition
that shifts every day of the diary.

42:24.821 --> 42:28.814
Simple but time-consuming to translate,
even with the five-letter keyword.

42:28.892 --> 42:30.621
Which is?

42:30.694 --> 42:32.685
We magicians have a circle of trust.

42:32.763 --> 42:36.859
You have a circle of trust
with someone whose diary you stole?

42:36.933 --> 42:38.696
Maybe I bought it.

42:38.769 --> 42:41.499
And you're hoping to find
a great secret in there?

42:41.571 --> 42:43.869
I've already found it.

42:43.940 --> 42:45.339
That's why I'm here.

42:51.548 --> 42:54.176
Tesla built one for another magician.

42:54.251 --> 42:56.014
Why would you want the same thing?

42:56.086 --> 42:58.077
Call it a professional rivalry.

42:58.155 --> 43:02.285
Mr. Tesla has built unusual
machines for unusual people.

43:03.293 --> 43:06.387
- But he would never talk about it.
- I understand discretion.

43:06.463 --> 43:07.760
I just want the machine.

43:11.101 --> 43:12.762
Finish your drink.

43:13.737 --> 43:16.433
I want to show you something.
I think you'll have

43:16.506 --> 43:18.736
a special appreciation for our work.

43:18.809 --> 43:22.267
- I thought it was a secret.
- You're a magician.

43:22.345 --> 43:24.074
Who's gonna believe you?

43:25.248 --> 43:27.443
Not long now.

43:27.517 --> 43:29.985
Our equipment requires
a great deal of current.

43:30.053 --> 43:31.782
Tesla electrified the whole town

43:31.855 --> 43:34.915
in exchange for using the
generators when we need them.

43:36.126 --> 43:39.323
We do our tests when
the townspeople are asleep.

43:39.396 --> 43:42.092
Mr. Tesla doesn't want
to scare anyone.

43:44.501 --> 43:47.334
[Electrical humming]

43:59.916 --> 44:01.941
Where are the wires?

44:03.320 --> 44:04.582
Exactly.

44:13.797 --> 44:16.493
Where's the generator?

44:16.566 --> 44:17.999
You saw it last week.

44:18.068 --> 44:21.162
- That must be ten miles from here.
- Fifteen.

44:21.238 --> 44:25.334
And I have to ride all of them
before I get to bed.

44:25.408 --> 44:28.104
I'll send word for you
in a few days, Mr. Angier.

44:28.178 --> 44:32.274
<i>[Angier] Magic. Real magic.</i>

44:32.349 --> 44:34.476
[Man] Now appearing, only here
at London's Royal Albert Hall,

44:36.520 --> 44:38.818
one of the miracles of our age.

44:38.889 --> 44:43.485
A technological marvel. You've never
seen anything like it in your lives.

44:43.560 --> 44:46.290
Your eyes will not believe
what they're witnessing.

44:46.363 --> 44:49.230
The miracle of Nikola Tesla,
ladies and gentlemen.

44:49.299 --> 44:51.790
Free, clean power.
Like to know the future?

44:51.868 --> 44:54.928
The man who's speaking right now
is going to change the world.

44:55.005 --> 44:59.374
Come one, come all.
Immediate seating, no waiting.

44:59.442 --> 45:02.843
[Loud electrical zapping]

45:14.491 --> 45:15.719
Ladies and gentlemen,

45:15.792 --> 45:17.760
[gasps]

45:17.827 --> 45:19.658
Objections have been raised...

45:19.729 --> 45:23.165
They should be raised.
Does that look safe to you?

45:23.233 --> 45:25.793
Part of Thomas Edison's smear campaign

45:25.869 --> 45:31.569
against Mr. Tesla's
superior alternating current.

45:31.641 --> 45:34.474
[Man] We have asked Mr. Tesla
to reconsider.

45:34.544 --> 45:37.035
[Man 2] Which he will not!

45:37.113 --> 45:42.278
But I've been told he refuses
to appear under any such restrictions.

45:42.352 --> 45:44.912
- [Gasps]
- This thing's gonna blow.

45:46.256 --> 45:48.690
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

46:27.397 --> 46:28.523
[Borden] Hey.

46:30.767 --> 46:33.201
Hello, Jess.

46:35.672 --> 46:39.472
Have you had a nice day
with mommy? Huh?

46:40.410 --> 46:42.435
Sarah.

46:42.512 --> 46:45.413
- I love you.
- See, today it's true.

46:45.482 --> 46:48.042
- Yeah.
- Hello.

46:49.953 --> 46:52.319
<i>[Angier] I saw happiness.</i>

46:52.389 --> 46:55.017
<i>Happiness that should have been mine.</i>

46:55.091 --> 46:57.116
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

46:57.193 --> 47:01.823
<i>His notebook reveals that</i>
<i>he never had the life that I envied.</i>

<i>he rails against the next,</i>
<i>demanding freedom.</i>

<i>His mind... his mind is a divided one.</i>

47:15.745 --> 47:19.704
<i>by his fickle and contradictory nature.</i>

47:23.920 --> 47:26.411
So, what do you think you'll call her?

47:26.489 --> 47:27.854
I don't know.

47:27.924 --> 47:30.222
Everybody needs a name, so, what's hers?

47:31.127 --> 47:32.924
Maybe Sarah.

47:35.298 --> 47:37.698
That's a lovely name.
That's a lovely name.

47:37.767 --> 47:40.998
Well, you talk about what you want
to do for the rest of the day.

47:41.071 --> 47:42.936
All right, go on, you talk with her.

47:45.375 --> 47:49.641
Are they taking her away?

47:49.713 --> 47:51.613
To the workhouse?

47:54.451 --> 47:55.941
You keep talking.

47:58.655 --> 48:01.055
Tell Owens I've reconsidered. Take it.

48:01.124 --> 48:02.921
Go on, take it.

48:06.496 --> 48:08.623
It's for the best.

48:13.436 --> 48:16.030
Let me see.

48:16.106 --> 48:18.734
I'm gonna learn
all the professor's secrets.

48:18.808 --> 48:22.244
Only if I teach you how to read.

48:22.312 --> 48:24.678
They're just stupid tricks, right?

48:24.748 --> 48:27.979
Haven't helped you
get out of here, have they?

48:28.051 --> 48:31.384
Or can't you undo real locks, professor?

48:32.756 --> 48:35.418
Maybe I'm just biding my time.

48:35.492 --> 48:37.983
Maybe one day I'll...

48:38.061 --> 48:40.689
...open my hand, get your attention,

48:40.764 --> 48:43.665
ask, "Are you watching closely?"

48:43.733 --> 48:45.826
Maybe a magic whirl or two.

48:48.438 --> 48:50.269
And then I'll be gone.

48:53.877 --> 48:56.937
How'd you get so famous then?

48:57.847 --> 48:59.576
Magic.

49:02.051 --> 49:04.918
- Oi! Borden, get back here!
- [All laughing]

49:04.988 --> 49:06.546
Thank you.

49:06.623 --> 49:08.591
Shut up!

49:09.526 --> 49:11.824
[Laughing continues]

49:11.895 --> 49:13.988
Where's the bloody key?!

49:14.063 --> 49:17.931
[Distant electrical humming]

49:20.603 --> 49:23.071
<i>[Angier] February 8, 1899.</i>

49:23.139 --> 49:25.266
<i>Today, finally, a breakthrough.</i>

49:25.341 --> 49:28.071
<i>Tesla's agreed to see me.</i>

49:28.144 --> 49:31.341
<i>[Electrical zapping]</i>

49:35.819 --> 49:36.979
Perfectly safe.

49:58.508 --> 50:02.274
So this is the Great Danton.

50:02.345 --> 50:06.941
Mr. Alley has effused about your act
to me on any number of occasions.

50:08.785 --> 50:10.343
Hold out other hand.

50:18.928 --> 50:22.728
- What's conducting the electricity?
- Our bodies, Mr. Angier.

50:22.799 --> 50:26.997
Quite capable of conducting
and, indeed, producing energy.

50:28.538 --> 50:30.597
Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?

50:32.508 --> 50:35.671
[Chuckling] I need something impossible.

50:37.447 --> 50:42.214
You're familiar with the phrase,
"Man's reach exceeds his grasp"?

50:42.285 --> 50:43.980
Is a lie.

50:44.053 --> 50:46.078
Man's grasp exceeds his nerve.

50:47.290 --> 50:50.157
Society only tolerates
one change at a time.

50:51.628 --> 50:54.893
First time I tried to change the world,

50:54.964 --> 50:56.727
I was hailed as a visionary.

50:57.233 --> 50:59.360
Second time...

50:59.435 --> 51:02.461
...I was asked politely to retire.

51:03.606 --> 51:07.133
So here I am, enjoying my retirement.

51:07.210 --> 51:11.078
Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier.
What you want is simply expensive.

51:11.147 --> 51:13.377
If I were to build for you this machine,

51:13.449 --> 51:16.509
you would be presenting it
merely as illusion?

51:16.586 --> 51:19.919
Well, if people actually
believed the things I did on stage,

51:19.989 --> 51:22.389
they wouldn't clap, they'd scream.

51:22.458 --> 51:24.449
Think of sawing a woman in half.

51:24.527 --> 51:26.859
Have you considered the cost of this?

51:26.930 --> 51:28.864
Price is not an object.

51:28.932 --> 51:32.891
Perhaps not, but have you
considered the cost?

51:33.870 --> 51:35.201
I'm not sure I follow.

51:36.272 --> 51:38.103
Go home, forget this thing.

51:38.174 --> 51:40.369
I can recognize an obsession.

51:40.443 --> 51:44.470
- No good will come of it.
- Hasn't good come of your obsessions?

51:44.547 --> 51:47.778
At first, but I have
followed them too long.

51:47.850 --> 51:49.784
I am their slave.

51:49.852 --> 51:52.946
And one day,
they will choose to destroy me.

51:54.757 --> 51:59.194
If you understand an obsession, then
you know you won't change my mind.

52:00.129 --> 52:01.118
So be it.

52:02.632 --> 52:03.963
Will you build it?

52:04.934 --> 52:08.495
I've already begun
to build it, Mr. Angier.

52:08.571 --> 52:12.564
I hope you enjoy the mountain air.
This will take some time.

52:20.149 --> 52:22.947
[Deep inhale, exhale]

52:36.499 --> 52:39.195
Uh... I thought you'd gone.

52:40.336 --> 52:42.804
I don't really have anywhere to go.

52:44.774 --> 52:46.674
You've been sleeping here?

52:46.743 --> 52:51.476
Cutter said it'd be all right till we
get another booking. What are you doing?

52:51.547 --> 52:53.777
Uh... research.

52:53.850 --> 52:55.283
Part of a magician's job

52:55.351 --> 52:58.218
is to... watch his competition,
see what illusions...

52:58.287 --> 53:01.222
You're going to do something
to that man, aren't you?

53:01.290 --> 53:03.155
Cutter's hoping you let things lie.

53:03.226 --> 53:06.093
He says if Borden thinks
things are even between you...

53:06.162 --> 53:07.993
Even?

53:08.064 --> 53:10.624
My wife for a couple of his fingers?

53:10.700 --> 53:13.794
He has a family now
and he's performing again.

53:13.870 --> 53:16.703
Borden is out there living
his life just as he intended,

53:16.773 --> 53:19.469
as if nothing had happened
and look at me.

53:19.542 --> 53:22.033
I'm alone and no theater will touch me.

53:22.111 --> 53:23.703
Us.

53:23.780 --> 53:26.146
You're going to need a better disguise.

53:43.666 --> 53:45.861
I need a volunteer.

53:45.935 --> 53:47.402
[Wenscombe] What happened?

53:48.404 --> 53:50.235
Did you hurt him?

53:52.141 --> 53:53.438
What happened, Robert?

53:55.845 --> 53:59.804
You, sir. Just a rubber ball, yes?

53:59.882 --> 54:00.974
Thank you.

54:01.050 --> 54:03.644
Just a rubber ball? No.

54:03.719 --> 54:06.916
Not normal. Not a normal rubber ball.

54:06.989 --> 54:08.115
It's magic.

54:08.925 --> 54:10.984
He had a new trick.

54:25.007 --> 54:26.565
[Wenscombe] Was it good?

54:30.947 --> 54:34.906
It was the greatest
magic trick I've ever seen.

54:36.919 --> 54:38.750
- [Door opens]
- [Minimal applause]

54:38.821 --> 54:40.948
[Angier] Did they applaud
when you saw it?

54:41.023 --> 54:44.891
It was too good. It was too simple.
The audience hardly had time to see it.

54:44.961 --> 54:47.828
- He's a dreadful magician.
- A wonderful magician.

54:47.897 --> 54:50.422
He's a dreadful showman.
He doesn't dress it up,

54:50.500 --> 54:52.331
- how to sell it.
- How does he do it?

54:52.401 --> 54:54.426
- He uses a double.
- No, it's too simple.

54:54.504 --> 54:55.994
This is a complex illusion.

54:56.072 --> 54:58.472
You say that because
you don't know the method.

54:58.541 --> 55:00.941
It's a double that comes out.
It's the only way.

55:01.010 --> 55:04.912
I've seen him perform it three times.
The prestige is the same man.

55:04.981 --> 55:08.508
- No, it's not.
- The same man comes out of the cabinet.

55:08.584 --> 55:10.848
It's the same man.

55:10.920 --> 55:13.616
He wears padded gloves
to hide his damaged fingers,

55:13.689 --> 55:16.283
but, if you look closely, you can tell.

55:17.994 --> 55:20.861
He doesn't know how to sell it
to an audience, but I do.

55:20.930 --> 55:23.364
Yeah, we could use it
as a climax to the show.

55:23.432 --> 55:25.832
Yes.

55:25.902 --> 55:29.099
The man stole my life,
I'm gonna steal his trick.

55:29.172 --> 55:31.333
We got to find someone
who looks like you.

55:31.407 --> 55:34.934
- He doesn't use a double.
- I don't know how Borden does it.

55:35.011 --> 55:39.505
Either... You either wait for him
to retire and buy the secret,

55:39.582 --> 55:41.379
or you listen to how I would do it.

55:41.450 --> 55:43.975
And the only way
that I know how to do it

55:44.053 --> 55:46.521
is to find you a bloody good double.

55:47.523 --> 55:48.922
All right.

55:50.359 --> 55:52.850
Take a good look.
Let's get out there and find me.

55:52.929 --> 55:55.056
Whoo!

55:55.131 --> 55:56.621
Look, look.

56:01.170 --> 56:02.694
What's that?

56:06.042 --> 56:08.340
- It's for you.
- What's this for?

56:08.978 --> 56:10.809
Come.

56:13.950 --> 56:15.713
[Sarah] You...

56:15.785 --> 56:19.812
- I asked you last week...
- You caught me in a wrong mood.

56:19.889 --> 56:22.084
- But you won't ever...
- Sarah,

56:22.158 --> 56:25.321
I'm gonna have
to change my mind, aren't I?

56:25.394 --> 56:30.058
The act is taking off. Soon we'll be in
a bigger theater, things will work out.

56:32.635 --> 56:36.435
I can't believe it. Thank you.
Thank you. It's beautiful.

56:43.079 --> 56:46.173
- Gerry?
- [Gasps] Darling, look at you.

56:46.249 --> 56:49.218
Mr. Cutter, Mr. Angier,
I'd like you to meet Gerald Root.

56:49.285 --> 56:51.446
Mm-hm.

56:51.520 --> 56:54.216
- [Whispering indistinctly]
- [Wenscombe giggles]

56:54.290 --> 56:58.226
A pleasure. Pleasure
to meet you fine gentlemen.

56:58.294 --> 57:02.025
Would you like for me
to tell you a little joke? Come here.

57:05.067 --> 57:08.161
Yes. Are you laughing now?

57:08.237 --> 57:10.262
[Chuckling]

57:11.607 --> 57:13.234
I have to take a piss.

57:14.644 --> 57:17.738
- He's out of his mind.
- Of course, he's an out-of-work actor.

57:17.813 --> 57:19.713
He's perfect. He needs a little help.

57:19.782 --> 57:22.751
But when I get done with him,
he could be your brother.

57:22.818 --> 57:25.412
I don't need him to be my
brother, I need him to be me.

57:25.488 --> 57:27.183
Give me a month.

57:33.963 --> 57:36.591
So you open the door...

57:36.666 --> 57:38.133
...and...

57:40.169 --> 57:42.000
[chuckling]

57:43.406 --> 57:45.431
[Exhales]

57:45.508 --> 57:47.271
Come on.

57:49.545 --> 57:50.910
- [Groans]
- [Chuckling]

57:50.980 --> 57:52.914
Couldn't you have found a softer one?

57:52.982 --> 57:55.314
Well, it's not for sleeping on.

57:55.384 --> 57:57.443
So, if you come down through there...

58:00.122 --> 58:03.148
...does Root go up through there?
- Yep.

58:03.225 --> 58:05.284
It's going to be amazing.

58:05.361 --> 58:08.819
Well, it has to be. Borden's
trick is getting noticed.

58:11.667 --> 58:14.033
The place was packed today.

58:15.638 --> 58:17.435
You went and saw his show again.

58:17.506 --> 58:19.940
Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Angier?

58:23.746 --> 58:25.304
[Root sighs]

58:26.615 --> 58:28.242
[Wenscombe giggles]

58:28.317 --> 58:30.649
All I have to do is
keep myself stinking drunk,

58:30.720 --> 58:33.052
and no one will be able
to tell the difference.

58:33.122 --> 58:35.215
Have a little faith, sir.

58:35.291 --> 58:39.193
Now, would you favor us
with a performance, Mr. Root?

58:57.646 --> 58:59.876
[Clapping]

58:59.949 --> 59:04.113
You'd drink, too, if you knew
the world half as well as I do.

59:07.823 --> 59:09.518
Did you think you were unique?

59:09.592 --> 59:12.288
I've been Caesar, I've played Faust.

59:12.361 --> 59:15.455
How difficult could it possibly
be to play the Great Danton?

59:15.531 --> 59:18.659
You can go back to being
yourself now, Root, for nothing.

59:18.734 --> 59:20.998
I'd rather be him for now.

59:21.070 --> 59:23.834
I find it, uh... amusing.

59:25.107 --> 59:27.200
[Chuckles]

59:27.276 --> 59:29.005
"My liege,

59:29.078 --> 59:32.411
I did deny no prisoners."

59:32.481 --> 59:34.642
- You look wonderful.
- Oh, thank you.

59:34.717 --> 59:37.982
Root has to keep a low profile.
Anyone sees him, the game's up.

59:38.053 --> 59:40.851
I don't know how you do things.
I'm not sure I wanna know.

59:40.923 --> 59:43.255
Have you thought what we should call it?

59:43.325 --> 59:47.489
There's no point being coy. Borden
calls his trick The Transported Man.

59:47.763 --> 59:51.062
[Applause]

59:51.400 --> 59:54.563
Ladies and gentlemen, much
of what you've seen may be termed

59:54.637 --> 59:58.403
- as illusions or entertaining trifles.
- [Rimshot]

59:58.474 --> 01:00:00.567
[Applause]

01:00:03.078 --> 01:00:04.136
Alas...

01:00:04.213 --> 01:00:06.238
[drumroll]

01:00:06.315 --> 01:00:08.840
...I cannot claim
this next feat as illusion.

01:00:09.752 --> 01:00:10.946
Watch carefully.

01:00:12.388 --> 01:00:14.822
You will see no trickery,

01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:17.984
for no trickery is employed.

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:21.427
Merely a technique familiar
to certain citizens of the Orient

01:00:21.497 --> 01:00:23.658
and various holy men of the Himalayas.

01:00:26.936 --> 01:00:29.962
Indeed, many of you may be
familiar with this technique,

01:00:30.039 --> 01:00:33.202
but for those of you who
are not, do not be alarmed.

01:00:33.275 --> 01:00:36.335
What you're about to see
is considered safe.

01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:44.283
[Applause, cheering]

01:00:52.394 --> 01:00:54.555
[Applause, cheering continues]

01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:10.970
To our achievement.

01:01:11.046 --> 01:01:13.810
The manager says he's
never seen a reaction like it.

01:01:13.883 --> 01:01:17.182
At least he saw it. I spent
the ovation hiding under the stage.

01:01:17.253 --> 01:01:19.585
No one cares about
the man who disappears.

01:01:19.655 --> 01:01:21.646
They care about the one who comes out.

01:01:21.724 --> 01:01:23.783
I care about the man in the box.

01:01:23.859 --> 01:01:28.159
Thank you. I don't know,
maybe we could switch before the trick.

01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:30.391
I'm the prestige,
and Root's below stage.

01:01:30.466 --> 01:01:33.401
No, the anticipation
of the trick is everything.

01:01:33.469 --> 01:01:36.529
We need your showmanship
to build up the suspense.

01:01:36.605 --> 01:01:40.166
Once Root opens his mouth, it's over.
He can't introduce this trick.

01:01:40.242 --> 01:01:42.972
Of course I can. I'm the Great Danton.

01:01:43.045 --> 01:01:46.640
Root, you bloody fool,
get out of that wardrobe and makeup.

01:01:46.715 --> 01:01:49.377
Anyone could walk in here at any minute.

01:01:49.451 --> 01:01:51.510
Congratulations, all.

01:01:51.587 --> 01:01:55.284
Life is not full of these
moments. We worked hard.

01:01:55.357 --> 01:01:57.018
We need to celebrate properly.

01:02:00.763 --> 01:02:03.231
What's wrong? Is it your wife?

01:02:03.299 --> 01:02:05.597
No, it's the trick.
It isn't good enough.

01:02:05.668 --> 01:02:09.001
Borden's trick is nothing
compared to ours. He has no style.

01:02:09.071 --> 01:02:12.939
He doesn't spend the finale
hiding under the stage.

01:02:13.008 --> 01:02:15.909
- I need to know how he does it.
- Why?

01:02:15.978 --> 01:02:18.469
So I can do it better.

01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:23.017
I need you to go and work for him.

01:02:26.055 --> 01:02:27.784
Work for him? Are you joking?

01:02:29.058 --> 01:02:30.252
You'll be my spy.

01:02:30.326 --> 01:02:32.521
We just got our start.
You want me to leave?

01:02:32.595 --> 01:02:34.688
That's how we advance. Think of it.

01:02:34.763 --> 01:02:37.960
People are excited by Cutter's
version. Imagine what we'd do

01:02:38.033 --> 01:02:42.470
with the real illusion. We'd have the
greatest magic act anyone's ever seen.

01:02:42.538 --> 01:02:46.304
- He knows I work for you.
- Exactly why he'll want to hire you.

01:02:46.375 --> 01:02:48.935
- He'll want my secret.
- Why would he trust me?

01:02:49.011 --> 01:02:51.707
Because you're
gonna tell him the truth.

01:02:54.617 --> 01:02:56.448
Hmm?

01:03:03.993 --> 01:03:05.119
Good girl.

01:03:05.194 --> 01:03:08.220
[Rattling]

01:03:08.297 --> 01:03:11.824
You must be curious to see what
so much money has bought you.

01:03:12.501 --> 01:03:15.402
Fitting you should be here
for her maiden voyage.

01:03:15.471 --> 01:03:17.302
Your hat.

01:03:25.247 --> 01:03:27.841
You might want to stand back.

01:03:29.752 --> 01:03:31.219
[Electric zapping]

01:03:42.965 --> 01:03:47.129
[Fizzling]

01:03:48.303 --> 01:03:49.429
I don't understand.

01:03:49.505 --> 01:03:51.837
Perhaps it would be best
if you left us to it.

01:03:51.907 --> 01:03:53.534
Is there a problem, Mr. Tesla?

01:03:53.609 --> 01:03:55.634
- No. Come back next week.
- Next week?

01:03:55.711 --> 01:03:58.271
- Next week, it will be fine.
- Tesla!

01:03:58.347 --> 01:04:00.076
Just a little temperamental.

01:04:02.751 --> 01:04:04.742
[Door closing]

01:04:05.921 --> 01:04:08.822
- Interesting workshop.
- Yeah, we make do.

01:04:08.891 --> 01:04:11.052
- My name is Olivia...
- I know who you are.

01:04:11.126 --> 01:04:12.787
Here to steal the rest of my show?

01:04:12.861 --> 01:04:14.761
To give your show what it's missing.

01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:18.061
- Yeah, what might that be?
- Me.

01:04:18.133 --> 01:04:22.593
[Chuckles] I was just
saying that, wasn't I?

01:04:22.671 --> 01:04:24.969
- A woman's touch.
- I've left Angier.

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:27.099
- All right.
- I want a job.

01:04:27.176 --> 01:04:28.507
Yeah.

01:04:28.577 --> 01:04:30.408
I know you've no reason to trust me.

01:04:30.479 --> 01:04:32.037
Why wouldn't I trust you?

01:04:32.114 --> 01:04:35.550
You're only the mistress of my
enemy. Why wouldn't I trust you?

01:04:37.219 --> 01:04:39.153
- Mr. Borden.
- Alfred.

01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:43.251
I'm going to tell you the truth.

01:04:43.325 --> 01:04:45.555
Now that is a slippery notion

01:04:45.627 --> 01:04:47.959
in our line of work,
isn't it, Miss Wenscombe?

01:04:50.065 --> 01:04:52.727
I am here because he sent me here.

01:04:52.801 --> 01:04:55.269
He wants me to work for you
and steal your secret.

01:04:55.337 --> 01:04:58.704
What does he need my secret for?
His trick is topnotch.

01:04:58.774 --> 01:05:01.368
He vanishes,
and then he reappears instantly

01:05:01.443 --> 01:05:03.934
on the other side
of the stage, mute, overweight

01:05:04.012 --> 01:05:06.572
and, unless I'm mistaken, very drunk.

01:05:06.648 --> 01:05:10.140
It's astonishing. How does
he do it? And tell me, Olivia,

01:05:10.219 --> 01:05:13.677
does he enjoy taking his bows
under the stage?

01:05:13.756 --> 01:05:17.055
It's killing him. He's obsessed
with discovering your methods.

01:05:17.126 --> 01:05:20.186
He thinks of nothing else,
takes no pleasure in our success.

01:05:20.262 --> 01:05:21.752
And I've had enough.

01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:24.230
There is no future with him.

01:05:25.367 --> 01:05:29.098
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've come to offer you his.

01:05:29.171 --> 01:05:33.073
This is the truth... is it?

01:05:37.613 --> 01:05:39.911
Think you'd better get dressed, sir.

01:05:39.982 --> 01:05:44.009
Root, you're late and more drunk than
usual. Get down below stairs right away.

01:05:44.086 --> 01:05:45.815
No.

01:05:45.888 --> 01:05:49.255
No, we need to have
a little chat, Mr. Cutter.

01:05:49.324 --> 01:05:53.658
We have a problem. Cutter, Borden
is performing right across the street.

01:05:53.729 --> 01:05:56.994
Yeah, we have a bigger problem.

01:05:57.065 --> 01:06:00.057
Root. He's realized
that he can make demands.

01:06:00.135 --> 01:06:02.228
Wha...? He's blackmailing us?

01:06:02.304 --> 01:06:04.272
I was surprised, to tell you the truth.

01:06:04.339 --> 01:06:06.933
It usually takes them
a lot longer to figure it out.

01:06:07.009 --> 01:06:09.569
- How much does he want?
- It makes no difference.

01:06:09.645 --> 01:06:13.103
- We've got to stop doing the trick.
- Stop the trick? Look at this.

01:06:13.182 --> 01:06:19.018
Last week they said you were
the premier stage performer in London.

01:06:19.087 --> 01:06:22.454
Not magician, mind you.
Performer of any kind.

01:06:22.524 --> 01:06:25.755
- What's your point?
- My point is, you've climbed too high

01:06:25.828 --> 01:06:28.262
to get away with
professional embarrassment.

01:06:28.330 --> 01:06:31.697
We don't do any tricks we can't control.

01:06:33.869 --> 01:06:37.168
Just pay him for now. We keep
doing the trick until Borden opens,

01:06:37.239 --> 01:06:39.207
and then we'll phase it out.

01:06:40.108 --> 01:06:41.598
All right.

01:06:44.379 --> 01:06:46.506
<i>[Angier] Cutter was always surprised</i>

01:06:46.582 --> 01:06:48.482
<i>how fast Root turned bad.</i>

01:06:48.550 --> 01:06:53.112
To what do I owe the pleasure
of this rather welcome pint of ale?

01:06:53.188 --> 01:06:56.316
- You're the Great Danton, aren't you?
- Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

01:06:56.391 --> 01:07:00.054
Of course I am, but don't advertise it,
because I'll be mobbed with fans.

01:07:00.128 --> 01:07:02.562
<i>[Angier] We paid him enough</i>
<i>to keep him in beers.</i>

01:07:02.631 --> 01:07:04.724
<i>You wouldn't expect him</i>
<i>to rock the boat.</i>

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.394
Many of you may be
familiar with this technique,

01:07:07.469 --> 01:07:10.961
but for those of you
who aren't, do not be alarmed.

01:07:11.039 --> 01:07:14.202
What you're about to see
is considered safe.

01:07:14.276 --> 01:07:17.905
- And who are you?
- I am a humble admirer

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:20.574
and a fellow practitioner.

01:07:20.649 --> 01:07:23.015
Mmm. Very good.

01:07:27.289 --> 01:07:28.984
[Grunts]

01:07:32.394 --> 01:07:35.227
- [Borden] Another one?
- Oh, if you insist.

01:07:35.297 --> 01:07:38.027
- [Borden] Another.
- I'm not performing tonight.

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:40.125
I'm only doing one show,
but to be frank,

01:07:40.202 --> 01:07:42.534
my people pretty much
run things these days.

01:07:42.604 --> 01:07:43.798
Get up there.

01:07:45.173 --> 01:07:46.231
Get up!

01:07:46.308 --> 01:07:49.072
Your illusion, The Transported Man,

01:07:49.144 --> 01:07:51.738
I'm not claiming to know your methods,

01:07:51.813 --> 01:07:56.011
but I had a similar trick in my act,

01:07:56.084 --> 01:07:58.917
and, uh... [whispering] I used a double.

01:07:58.987 --> 01:08:04.186
- Mm, I see, very good.
- Well, it was, and then it went bad.

01:08:04.259 --> 01:08:07.660
What I didn't count on was that
when I incorporated this bloke

01:08:07.729 --> 01:08:09.822
into my act,

01:08:09.898 --> 01:08:11.889
he had complete power over me.

01:08:13.035 --> 01:08:14.662
Complete power, you say?

01:08:19.107 --> 01:08:21.234
[Laughing]

01:08:21.310 --> 01:08:23.870
[Applause]

01:08:25.546 --> 01:08:28.140
[Grunting]

01:08:30.652 --> 01:08:32.085
Ohh! [laughs]

01:08:32.154 --> 01:08:37.421
Be very careful giving
someone that power over you.

01:08:37.492 --> 01:08:41.826
Huh. Thank you. Um...

01:08:41.897 --> 01:08:44.764
Yes, thank you for the warning.

01:08:44.832 --> 01:08:47.529
Hmm. Cheers.

01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:51.098
I cannot claim
this next feat as illusion.

01:08:51.173 --> 01:08:54.540
What you're about to see
is considered safe.

01:08:58.846 --> 01:09:00.542
Ahh!

01:09:03.251 --> 01:09:06.345
[Moaning]

01:09:14.029 --> 01:09:16.725
[Crowd laughing]

01:09:16.798 --> 01:09:20.359
[Applause]

01:09:29.044 --> 01:09:31.478
[Chuckling]

01:09:31.546 --> 01:09:32.706
[Laughing, applause]

01:09:32.781 --> 01:09:37.741
Oh! The Great Danton.

01:09:43.959 --> 01:09:45.823
I apologize.

01:09:45.894 --> 01:09:49.660
There simply is too much magic...

01:09:49.731 --> 01:09:52.495
...for my stage at The Pantages

01:09:52.567 --> 01:09:54.728
across the street.

01:09:58.774 --> 01:10:01.709
Pardon my intrusion.

01:10:03.779 --> 01:10:08.182
And go easy on the poor chap.
He does try so very hard.

01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:10.980
[All laughing, applauding]

01:10:11.053 --> 01:10:13.487
I don't know how Borden found him.

01:10:13.555 --> 01:10:15.455
Kept him under wraps. I was careful.

01:10:15.524 --> 01:10:17.185
Yeah, well, he did.

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.351
Do you think it was her?

01:10:26.601 --> 01:10:29.570
You weren't expecting me?

01:10:29.638 --> 01:10:32.368
I expected you sooner.
Your message said afternoon.

01:10:32.441 --> 01:10:34.705
It takes a bit for me
to get around these days.

01:10:34.776 --> 01:10:38.837
He's taken everything from me.
My wife, my career,

01:10:38.914 --> 01:10:40.779
- now you.
- You sent me.

01:10:40.849 --> 01:10:43.909
I sent you to steal his secret,
not to improve his act.

01:10:43.985 --> 01:10:45.543
- It's my job.
- Or fall in love!

01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:48.384
- I did everything you asked!
- Yes? Yes?

01:10:48.457 --> 01:10:50.948
- How does he do it?
- Cutter was right, a double.

01:10:51.026 --> 01:10:53.256
- 'Course he said that.
- He didn't say it.

01:10:53.328 --> 01:10:56.764
I've seen things, makeup, glasses, wigs.
We don't use for the show.

01:10:56.832 --> 01:10:59.562
- I've seen it hidden backstage.
- Misdirection.

01:10:59.634 --> 01:11:02.330
He leaves them lying
around to make you think that.

01:11:02.404 --> 01:11:04.269
He doesn't know when I'm looking.

01:11:04.339 --> 01:11:07.570
All the time, Olivia! That's who he is!

01:11:07.642 --> 01:11:08.904
That's what it takes!

01:11:08.977 --> 01:11:11.411
He lives his act, don't you see?

01:11:13.448 --> 01:11:16.815
Just because you're sleeping
with him doesn't mean he trusts you.

01:11:16.885 --> 01:11:19.285
You think you can see
everything, don't you?

01:11:19.354 --> 01:11:22.187
The Great Danton is a blind fool.

01:11:22.257 --> 01:11:23.656
His notebook.

01:11:25.026 --> 01:11:27.290
You stole it?

01:11:27.362 --> 01:11:29.159
I borrowed it for tonight.

01:11:29.231 --> 01:11:31.426
I thought you could translate
some of it...

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:35.561
I can't. No one can. It's a cipher.

01:11:35.637 --> 01:11:39.073
Even with the keyword,
it will take months to decode.

01:11:39.141 --> 01:11:42.042
- And without the keyword?
- Perhaps never.

01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:43.737
- We'll see.
- We will not see.

01:11:43.812 --> 01:11:46.747
If I don't get that back by
tomorrow he'll know I took it.

01:11:46.815 --> 01:11:49.113
- Leave him.
- I can't. He knows where I live.

01:11:50.452 --> 01:11:55.253
This is his diary, Olivia. All of his
secrets are right here in my hands.

01:11:55.924 --> 01:11:57.516
It won't bring your wife back.

01:11:57.592 --> 01:12:00.288
I don't care about my wife.
I care about his secret.

01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:10.570
[Sighs, grunts]

01:12:13.542 --> 01:12:16.272
Look, I'll, um...

01:12:16.344 --> 01:12:18.676
I'll go to his workshop
and stage a break-in.

01:12:18.747 --> 01:12:21.944
- He'll know you took it.
- Yes, me. Not you.

01:12:23.051 --> 01:12:25.042
Understand?

01:12:33.495 --> 01:12:34.484
Robert.

01:12:36.898 --> 01:12:39.696
I have fallen in love with him.

01:12:40.602 --> 01:12:43.070
Then I know how hard
this has been for you.

01:12:51.613 --> 01:12:53.103
Notebook?

01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:57.741
Then he's just getting started.

01:12:57.886 --> 01:12:59.979
[Clapping]

01:13:00.055 --> 01:13:04.082
- [Drumroll]
- [Cymbal crashes]

01:13:04.159 --> 01:13:06.821
[Electrical zapping]

01:13:14.569 --> 01:13:16.969
[Applause]

01:13:26.982 --> 01:13:28.449
[All] Professor!

01:13:28.516 --> 01:13:30.006
Good evening.

01:13:30.085 --> 01:13:32.144
[Chattering]

01:13:34.889 --> 01:13:36.516
I'm walking tonight.

01:13:36.591 --> 01:13:39.151
Let him come. I don't care.

01:13:39.227 --> 01:13:41.923
[All] Professor! Professor!

01:14:09.557 --> 01:14:11.548
[Man yells]

01:14:18.166 --> 01:14:21.431
[Heart beating]

01:14:44.426 --> 01:14:46.553
[Man gagging, coughing]

01:15:04.312 --> 01:15:05.745
- [Gunshot]
- Ahh!

01:15:05.814 --> 01:15:08.374
- You all right?
- I'm alive.

01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:10.543
Saves me cutting you an air hole.

01:15:24.632 --> 01:15:27.192
- I'm impressed.
- Why is that?

01:15:27.268 --> 01:15:30.237
You're finally getting your hands dirty.

01:15:30.305 --> 01:15:33.206
It's what a good trick costs, Angier.

01:15:33.274 --> 01:15:36.072
Risk, sacrifice.

01:15:36.144 --> 01:15:38.635
The sacrifice, I'm afraid,
is all gonna be yours,

01:15:38.713 --> 01:15:40.340
unless you give me what I want.

01:15:41.716 --> 01:15:43.843
- Which is?
- Your secret.

01:15:43.918 --> 01:15:45.317
My secret?

01:15:45.387 --> 01:15:48.515
Your method for The Transported Man.

01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:51.423
Fallon wouldn't tell me.
He doesn't talk at all.

01:15:51.493 --> 01:15:54.985
- You have my notebook.
- Useless without the keyword.

01:15:56.464 --> 01:16:00.025
Write down your method,
Mr. Borden, describe it in full.

01:16:13.148 --> 01:16:15.514
I want the whole method,
not the keyword.

01:16:15.583 --> 01:16:17.983
I don't know if your secret's
in your notebook.

01:16:18.052 --> 01:16:20.520
The keyword is the method.

01:16:24.526 --> 01:16:25.823
Where's my <i>ingénieur?</i>

01:16:32.967 --> 01:16:35.595
- Alive?
- How fast can you dig?

01:16:38.072 --> 01:16:41.098
Fallon, you hear me? Fallon!

01:16:42.410 --> 01:16:45.072
- [Angier] How's the arm?
- Still attached.

01:16:46.514 --> 01:16:48.072
Did you find your answer?

01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:51.915
Our answer, Cutter. I haven't
looked yet. I wanted you to share this.

01:16:51.986 --> 01:16:54.420
I already know how he does it, Robert.

01:16:54.489 --> 01:16:57.583
Same way he always has,
the same way as we do.

01:16:57.659 --> 01:17:00.127
It's just that you want something more.

01:17:00.195 --> 01:17:02.959
Well, let's find out then, shall we?

01:17:07.268 --> 01:17:08.701
What does it mean?

01:17:16.544 --> 01:17:19.012
It means, Cutter, we have
a journey ahead of us.

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.947
- To America.
- Robert?

01:17:22.016 --> 01:17:24.985
Listen to me.

01:17:25.053 --> 01:17:28.511
Obsession is a young man's game.

01:17:28.590 --> 01:17:30.114
Come on.

01:17:30.191 --> 01:17:32.659
I can't follow you any further in it.

01:17:33.728 --> 01:17:35.662
I can't, I'm sorry.

01:17:39.767 --> 01:17:41.462
Then the rest is up to me.

01:17:43.538 --> 01:17:45.062
I'm sorry.

01:17:50.378 --> 01:17:53.973
Good evening. Hello, darling. [laughs]

01:17:54.048 --> 01:17:55.538
Champagne, your finest.

01:17:55.617 --> 01:17:58.313
I didn't know we were going
to be joined for dinner.

01:17:58.386 --> 01:18:00.684
Absolutely, we are celebrating.

01:18:00.755 --> 01:18:02.450
Miss Wenscombe, Mr. Fallon.

01:18:03.458 --> 01:18:06.325
- What are we celebrating?
- We've hit upon a new trick.

01:18:06.394 --> 01:18:08.453
- Haven't we?
- What trick, Freddie?

01:18:08.530 --> 01:18:10.555
Yes, Freddie, what trick?

01:18:10.632 --> 01:18:15.035
I am going to bury
myself alive every night,

01:18:15.103 --> 01:18:18.971
and then someone will come along
and dig me up. Wonderful.

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:22.134
- I think he's had quite enough...
- No, pour the champagne.

01:18:22.210 --> 01:18:25.907
Pour the... Sarah, don't talk to me
like that. I'm not a bloody child.

01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:29.177
- Perhaps it would be better...
- Mr. Fallon, escort her home.

01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:32.083
- My husband's being a bore.
- Oh, please.

01:18:32.153 --> 01:18:35.953
- I see no reason you should suffer.
- Don't ruin this evening.

01:18:38.359 --> 01:18:41.260
Good night, Mrs. Borden.
Good night, Freddie.

01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:47.998
- Freddie?
- That's my name.

01:18:48.069 --> 01:18:51.436
- Not at home.
- I'm not always at home, am I?

01:18:53.241 --> 01:18:55.903
Couldn't you have at least
taken off the beard?

01:18:55.977 --> 01:19:00.141
Sarah, I just came from
the bloody theater just now.

01:19:00.214 --> 01:19:03.274
All right? I'm out in public.
Everybody else loves it.

01:19:03.351 --> 01:19:05.285
Why are you being like this?

01:19:05.353 --> 01:19:08.254
I had a terrible ordeal today.

01:19:08.323 --> 01:19:12.089
I thought that
something very precious...

01:19:13.261 --> 01:19:15.195
...had been lost to me.

01:19:15.263 --> 01:19:18.391
So I just wanted
to celebrate just a little.

01:19:18.466 --> 01:19:21.924
All right, what? What did you lose?

01:19:27.075 --> 01:19:28.633
I see, more secrets.

01:19:29.577 --> 01:19:32.740
Sarah, secrets are my life.

01:19:34.682 --> 01:19:37.947
- Our life.
- No, Alfred, stop, this isn't you.

01:19:38.019 --> 01:19:40.487
Stop performing.

01:19:42.490 --> 01:19:44.651
[Shudders]

01:20:04.646 --> 01:20:07.137
I thought I had the place to myself.

01:20:07.215 --> 01:20:10.514
Unexpected guests, not very polite.

01:20:10.585 --> 01:20:12.416
A lot of questions.

01:20:12.487 --> 01:20:15.285
At first, I thought they
worked for the government.

01:20:15.356 --> 01:20:19.019
- No?
- Worse, they work for Thomas Edison.

01:20:20.995 --> 01:20:23.486
<i>[Borden] Today, a most</i>
<i>curious development.</i>

01:20:23.564 --> 01:20:26.624
<i>His assistant came to us</i>
<i>with a proposition.</i>

01:20:28.269 --> 01:20:31.670
<i>Obviously, Angier has sent her</i>
<i>and told her to admit as much.</i>

01:20:31.739 --> 01:20:34.537
Does he enjoy taking
his bows under the stage?

01:20:34.609 --> 01:20:38.375
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've come to offer you his.

01:20:38.446 --> 01:20:41.415
This is the truth...

01:20:41.482 --> 01:20:42.471
...is it?

01:20:50.525 --> 01:20:53.983
No, that's what he told
me to tell you. The truth...

01:20:54.062 --> 01:20:57.896
...is that I loved him and I stood by
him and he sent me to you,

01:20:57.965 --> 01:21:01.492
like he would send a stagehand
to pick up his shirts.

01:21:01.569 --> 01:21:04.367
I hate him for that.

01:21:04.439 --> 01:21:07.670
I could spot Angier's methods
from the back of the theater.

01:21:09.377 --> 01:21:11.641
So, what could you
possibly have to offer me?

01:21:11.713 --> 01:21:13.340
You may know his tricks,

01:21:13.414 --> 01:21:16.474
but you can't understand why
no one sees yours are better.

01:21:16.551 --> 01:21:19.111
You hide this.
I had to look very closely

01:21:19.187 --> 01:21:21.519
to spot it
during The Transported Man,

01:21:21.589 --> 01:21:24.422
but this makes you unique.

01:21:24.492 --> 01:21:26.517
It shows you aren't using a double.

01:21:26.594 --> 01:21:29.085
You mustn't hide it.
You must display it proudly.

01:21:29.163 --> 01:21:33.930
I'm sure it takes great skill
to perform illusions with one good hand.

01:21:34.001 --> 01:21:35.764
Yeah, it does.

01:21:37.538 --> 01:21:40.701
So let people know.

01:21:40.775 --> 01:21:44.267
You can be so much more than
he is and I can show you how.

01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:48.574
<i>[Borden] I think</i>
<i>she's telling the truth.</i>

01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:50.776
<i>I think we cannot trust her.</i>

01:21:54.322 --> 01:21:56.790
<i>But I love her. I need her.</i>

01:21:57.992 --> 01:22:01.325
<i>To open myself to such a relationship,</i>

01:22:01.395 --> 01:22:05.229
<i>to the dangers of such an affair,</i>

01:22:05.299 --> 01:22:10.100
<i>I need assurances of fidelity, of love.</i>

01:22:11.139 --> 01:22:12.731
<i>But how to be sure?</i>

01:22:14.942 --> 01:22:19.276
<i>I know a way. It's the only</i>
<i>way to know her mind.</i>

01:22:19.347 --> 01:22:21.178
How could he send you away?

01:22:23.050 --> 01:22:26.144
<i>[Borden] She must help me</i>
<i>rid ourselves of Angier.</i>

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:35.752
<i>Today, my mistress</i>
<i>proves her truthfulness.</i>

01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:37.559
<i>Not to me, you understand.</i>

01:22:37.632 --> 01:22:40.260
<i>I've been</i>
<i>convinced since she led me to Root.</i>

01:22:40.334 --> 01:22:43.861
<i>Today, Olivia proves her love for me</i>

01:22:43.938 --> 01:22:46.406
<i>to you, Angier.</i>

01:22:46.474 --> 01:22:50.877
<i>Yes, Angier, she gave you</i>
<i>this notebook at my request.</i>

01:22:50.945 --> 01:22:54.381
<i>And yes, "Tesla" is merely</i>
<i>the key to my dairy,</i>

01:22:54.448 --> 01:22:57.246
<i>not to my trick.</i>
<i>You really think I'd part</i>

01:22:57.318 --> 01:23:00.446
<i>with my secret so easily after so much?</i>

01:23:00.521 --> 01:23:02.182
<i>Goodbye, Angier.</i>

01:23:02.256 --> 01:23:04.622
<i>May you find solace</i>
<i>for your forward ambition</i>

01:23:04.692 --> 01:23:06.489
<i>back in your American home.</i>

01:23:16.003 --> 01:23:17.630
Tesla!

01:23:19.574 --> 01:23:21.974
Tesla! Alley!

01:23:23.177 --> 01:23:24.166
Alley!

01:23:24.245 --> 01:23:26.839
Tesla never made a machine
like the one I asked for.

01:23:26.914 --> 01:23:29.712
- I never said he had.
- You let me believe that he had.

01:23:29.784 --> 01:23:32.480
You stole my money because
your funding was cut off.

01:23:32.553 --> 01:23:35.454
You've been shooting
sparks in my top hat,

01:23:35.523 --> 01:23:39.015
laughing at me all along,
while using my money to stave off ruin.

01:23:39.861 --> 01:23:41.988
- I have seen Edison's men.
- Where?

01:23:42.063 --> 01:23:44.554
In the hotel, I have a mind
to bring them up here.

01:23:44.632 --> 01:23:47.328
That would be unwise, Mr. Angier.

01:23:47.401 --> 01:23:50.529
It is true that you are
our last remaining financier,

01:23:50.605 --> 01:23:52.470
but we have not stolen your money.

01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:54.007
This is my cat.

01:23:54.075 --> 01:23:57.135
When I told you I could make you
a machine, I spoke a truth.

01:23:57.211 --> 01:23:58.303
Why isn't it working?

01:23:58.379 --> 01:24:00.711
Because exact science, Mr. Angier,

01:24:00.781 --> 01:24:02.180
is not an exact science.

01:24:02.250 --> 01:24:05.413
The machine simply
does not operate as expected.

01:24:05.486 --> 01:24:09.513
- It requires further examination.
- So where did my top hat go?

01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:10.648
Nowhere.

01:24:10.725 --> 01:24:13.523
We tried the damn thing a dozen times.

01:24:13.594 --> 01:24:15.221
The hat went nowhere.

01:24:15.296 --> 01:24:17.196
We need to try different material.

01:24:17.265 --> 01:24:19.426
It may provoke a different result.

01:24:19.967 --> 01:24:21.992
[Meowing]

01:24:22.069 --> 01:24:23.627
Great.

01:24:30.778 --> 01:24:34.737
You are responsible for whatever
happens to this animal, doctor.

01:24:39.253 --> 01:24:40.379
[Meows]

01:24:40.454 --> 01:24:42.945
[Electrical zapping]

01:24:53.434 --> 01:24:56.198
[Sighs]

01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:58.898
I hope whatever you were
really doing with my money

01:24:58.973 --> 01:25:01.407
was more worthwhile, Mr. Tesla.

01:25:13.721 --> 01:25:15.814
[Meowing]

01:25:15.890 --> 01:25:18.723
[Cats screeching]

01:25:28.903 --> 01:25:32.134
[Screeching continues]

01:25:32.206 --> 01:25:34.436
[Hissing]

01:25:57.331 --> 01:25:58.320
Alley!

01:26:01.402 --> 01:26:03.131
So the machine was working?

01:26:03.204 --> 01:26:06.833
I never checked the calibration,
'cause the hat never moved.

01:26:06.907 --> 01:26:09.774
These things never quite
work as you expect them to.

01:26:09.844 --> 01:26:12.335
That's one of the principal
beauties of science.

01:26:12.413 --> 01:26:15.871
I'll need a couple of weeks to iron out
the problems with the machine.

01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:18.009
We'll send word when it's ready.

01:26:20.221 --> 01:26:23.190
Don't forget your hat.

01:26:23.257 --> 01:26:26.988
- Well, which one is mine?
- They are all your hats.

01:26:32.933 --> 01:26:35.925
You look so pretty
in this new dress of yours.

01:26:36.003 --> 01:26:39.837
- Are we going to the zoo?
- No, Daddy has some errands to run.

01:26:39.907 --> 01:26:42.137
- But you promised.
- I promised, did I?

01:26:42.209 --> 01:26:44.507
Then go to the zoo, we shall.

01:26:44.578 --> 01:26:48.036
Daddy will go run his errands,
and I'll be back before you know it.

01:26:48.115 --> 01:26:51.846
So you go get ready. We'll go
see those chimpanzees. [hoots]

01:26:54.855 --> 01:26:58.256
Sarah... what are you doing?

01:27:01.929 --> 01:27:04.921
Each of us have our vices.

01:27:08.035 --> 01:27:10.503
Sarah, whatever you may think...

01:27:12.073 --> 01:27:15.702
...your only competition
for my affections is our little girl.

01:27:15.776 --> 01:27:18.745
I love you. I will always love you

01:27:18.813 --> 01:27:20.246
and you alone.

01:27:22.116 --> 01:27:25.916
- You mean it today.
- Absolutely.

01:27:25.986 --> 01:27:29.820
Which makes it so much
harder when you don't.

01:27:39.166 --> 01:27:41.964
More shopping. She does
love the smell of money.

01:27:42.036 --> 01:27:46.336
The little lady wants to go to the zoo,
so I thought you could take her, yeah?

01:27:46.407 --> 01:27:48.773
I mean, I can do it tomorrow, if not.

01:27:48.843 --> 01:27:52.142
And, uh... Sarah,

01:27:52.213 --> 01:27:54.340
she knows.

01:27:54.415 --> 01:27:58.579
Uh, at least she knows
that something is not right,

01:27:58.652 --> 01:28:01.553
so if you can just do
whatever you can to help me.

01:28:01.622 --> 01:28:06.184
Talk to her, just
convince her that I do love her.

01:28:16.837 --> 01:28:18.805
What is it, Freddie?

01:28:18.873 --> 01:28:21.171
Listen, don't call me that, please.

01:28:21.242 --> 01:28:25.110
It's nothing. It's just that
sometimes it seems wrong.

01:28:25.179 --> 01:28:27.670
I told you, when you're
with me, you're with me.

01:28:27.748 --> 01:28:30.774
Leave your family at home
where they belong.

01:28:30.851 --> 01:28:34.116
I'm trying. I'm trying, Olivia.

01:28:34.188 --> 01:28:36.554
- I'll get dressed.
- Yeah.

01:28:38.058 --> 01:28:41.084
I saw Fallon hanging around again.

01:28:41.162 --> 01:28:43.630
There's something about
that man I don't trust.

01:28:43.697 --> 01:28:46.757
You trust me? Then trust Fallon.

01:28:46.834 --> 01:28:49.496
He protects the things
that I care about.

01:28:49.570 --> 01:28:52.562
[Engine sputters]

01:29:27.741 --> 01:29:30.232
We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier.

01:29:30.311 --> 01:29:32.871
We were sorry to see
Mr. Tesla leave, as well.

01:29:32.947 --> 01:29:35.040
He's very good to Colorado Springs.

01:29:35.115 --> 01:29:37.777
Mr. Angier,

01:29:37.851 --> 01:29:41.480
I didn't think it was necessary
to tell Edison's men about the box.

01:29:41.555 --> 01:29:43.216
What box?

01:30:08.549 --> 01:30:11.950
<i>[Tesla] I apologize for leaving</i>
<i>without saying goodbye.</i>

01:30:12.019 --> 01:30:17.252
<i>But I seem to have outstayed</i>
<i>my welcome in Colorado.</i>

01:30:17.324 --> 01:30:21.818
<i>The truly extraordinary is not</i>
<i>permitted in science and industry.</i>

01:30:21.895 --> 01:30:24.693
<i>Perhaps you'll find</i>
<i>more luck in your field,</i>

01:30:24.765 --> 01:30:27.427
<i>where people are happy to be mystified.</i>

01:30:27.501 --> 01:30:31.460
<i>You will find what you</i>
<i>are looking for in this box.</i>

01:30:31.538 --> 01:30:35.975
<i>Alley has written you</i>
<i>a thorough set of instructions.</i>

01:30:36.043 --> 01:30:40.776
<i>I add only one suggestion</i>
<i>on using the machine.</i>

01:30:40.848 --> 01:30:42.816
<i>Destroy it.</i>

01:30:42.883 --> 01:30:46.182
<i>Drop it to the bottom</i>
<i>of the deepest ocean.</i>

01:30:46.253 --> 01:30:49.654
<i>Such a thing will bring you only misery.</i>

01:30:53.527 --> 01:30:57.156
<i>[Angier] Tesla's warning is</i>
<i>as unheeded as he knew it would be.</i>

01:30:57.231 --> 01:31:00.792
<i>Today I tested the machine.</i>
<i>Taking precautions in case</i>

01:31:00.868 --> 01:31:03.837
<i>Tesla hadn't ironed out</i>
<i>the kinks in its operation.</i>

01:31:03.904 --> 01:31:05.701
<i>But if it went wrong,</i>

01:31:05.773 --> 01:31:07.934
<i>I would not want to live</i>
<i>like that for long.</i>

01:31:10.678 --> 01:31:12.270
[Electrical zapping]

01:31:27.394 --> 01:31:31.524
<i>[Angier] But here at the turn,</i>
<i>I must leave you, Borden.</i>

01:31:31.598 --> 01:31:33.828
<i>Yes, you, Borden,</i>

01:31:33.901 --> 01:31:36.267
<i>sitting there in your cell,</i>

01:31:36.337 --> 01:31:40.364
<i>reading my diary, awaiting your death,</i>

01:31:40.441 --> 01:31:42.432
<i>for my murder.</i>

01:31:47.781 --> 01:31:51.080
Angier's journal, that gesture
of good faith, that's a fake.

01:31:51.151 --> 01:31:52.448
I assure you, it's not.

01:31:52.519 --> 01:31:55.454
The provenance of the journal
is clear and under no doubt.

01:31:55.522 --> 01:32:00.016
And it's written in Angier's own hand,
for which we have numerous examples.

01:32:01.895 --> 01:32:03.795
It don't matter.

01:32:05.733 --> 01:32:07.758
So my tricks.

01:32:11.004 --> 01:32:14.462
- All of them.
- Including The Transported Man?

01:32:15.909 --> 01:32:19.106
- Lord Caldlow will be very pleased.
- No, he won't.

01:32:19.179 --> 01:32:21.545
They're not complete.

01:32:21.615 --> 01:32:24.345
It's just the pledge
and the turn for each.

01:32:24.418 --> 01:32:28.479
Without the prestige for these
tricks, these are worthless.

01:32:28.555 --> 01:32:30.580
Yeah.

01:32:30.657 --> 01:32:34.184
You get the rest of it...
when you bring my daughter here.

01:32:36.930 --> 01:32:39.160
I want to say goodbye.

01:32:40.901 --> 01:32:44.064
[Sarah] We have to go through it now.
We have to go through it now.

01:32:44.138 --> 01:32:46.504
Now, listen to me, deny it all you want.

01:32:46.573 --> 01:32:48.939
Olivia means nothing.

01:32:49.009 --> 01:32:50.806
- Olivia?
- I need an assistant.

01:32:50.878 --> 01:32:53.711
- I'll go to her, I'll tell her.
- You'll tell her what?

01:32:53.781 --> 01:32:55.840
I know what you really are, Alfred.

01:32:57.951 --> 01:32:59.714
- I know.
- Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.

01:32:59.787 --> 01:33:02.415
- I can't keep it in.
- You can't talk like this.

01:33:02.489 --> 01:33:05.014
- No. No.
- Sarah, shut up! Sarah, shut up!

01:33:05.092 --> 01:33:09.222
I don't want to hear it anymore.
You can't talk like this.

01:33:11.832 --> 01:33:15.233
[Sarah] You can't hide it anymore,
because I know, Alfred, I know.

01:33:15.302 --> 01:33:18.738
I know what you really are, Alfred.

01:33:18.806 --> 01:33:21.604
I can't live like this.

01:33:21.675 --> 01:33:23.802
Oh, well, you think
I can live like this?

01:33:23.877 --> 01:33:27.040
You think I bloody enjoy
living like this?

01:33:27.114 --> 01:33:31.517
We have this beautiful house,
lovely little girl, we're married.

01:33:31.585 --> 01:33:33.246
What is so wrong with your life?

01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:35.914
Alfred, I can't live like this!

01:33:35.989 --> 01:33:38.355
Well, what do you want from me?

01:33:41.695 --> 01:33:45.392
I... I want...

01:33:45.466 --> 01:33:48.526
I want you to be... honest with me.

01:33:51.271 --> 01:33:53.739
No tricks.

01:33:53.807 --> 01:33:55.900
No lies.

01:33:55.976 --> 01:33:59.776
And no secrets.

01:34:06.053 --> 01:34:09.386
Do you... do you love me?

01:34:12.459 --> 01:34:14.086
Not today.

01:34:16.230 --> 01:34:17.288
No.

01:34:21.835 --> 01:34:24.668

01:35:54.962 --> 01:35:55.986
Who's there?

01:35:59.132 --> 01:36:01.225
I'm looking for an old friend.

01:36:01.301 --> 01:36:04.236
I heard about a booking,
nice little theater,

01:36:04.304 --> 01:36:06.738
- good up-and-coming magician.
- You're back.

01:36:06.807 --> 01:36:08.399
It's good to see you, John.

01:36:09.176 --> 01:36:11.906
Good rehearsal space.

01:36:11.979 --> 01:36:14.743
Blind stagehands, I like it. [laughs]

01:36:14.815 --> 01:36:17.477
You always had a good eye for publicity.

01:36:17.551 --> 01:36:18.882
I need your help, John.

01:36:18.952 --> 01:36:21.750
It's my last show. A limited engagement.

01:36:21.822 --> 01:36:23.449
Your last show?

01:36:23.523 --> 01:36:27.653
A wise man once told me obsession
was a young man's game.

01:36:27.728 --> 01:36:31.289
I'm almost done. There's one thing left.

01:36:32.299 --> 01:36:34.824
The Real Transported Man.

01:36:36.637 --> 01:36:38.628
You want to design a show around it?

01:36:38.705 --> 01:36:41.572
I don't want you backstage
I need you in front managing.

01:36:41.642 --> 01:36:44.304
Call in any favors
or connections you have left

01:36:44.378 --> 01:36:45.845
to get us the right booking.

01:36:45.912 --> 01:36:48.005
What sort of booking you after?

01:36:48.081 --> 01:36:50.481
The sort that Borden can't ignore.

01:36:56.857 --> 01:37:00.088
Oh, what an honor it is
to see you again, sir.

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:04.119
You told me you only wanted to show me
one trick that'd pique my interest.

01:37:04.197 --> 01:37:07.360
- It's a very clever trick.
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Ackerman.

01:37:07.434 --> 01:37:10.301
Likewise, I'm sure.
Let's get on, shall we?

01:37:13.940 --> 01:37:15.703
Turn it on, gentlemen.

01:37:20.947 --> 01:37:22.073
Very pretty.

01:37:33.126 --> 01:37:36.789
That's it, Cutter? He simply disappears?

01:37:36.863 --> 01:37:39.229
That's not a trick. He has to come back.

01:37:39.299 --> 01:37:41.460
- There has to be a...
- [Angier] A prestige?

01:37:41.535 --> 01:37:42.524
Exactly.

01:37:45.539 --> 01:37:48.201
Pardon me.

01:37:48.275 --> 01:37:51.540
It's very rare to see...

01:37:51.611 --> 01:37:53.078
...real magic.

01:37:54.581 --> 01:37:56.276
It's been many years since...

01:37:56.349 --> 01:37:58.078
Are you interested in helping us?

01:38:00.153 --> 01:38:03.884
Yes... but you'll have
to dress it up a little.

01:38:06.159 --> 01:38:07.820
Disguise it.

01:38:09.496 --> 01:38:11.987
Give them enough reason to doubt it.

01:38:12.799 --> 01:38:16.030
You haven't spoken
about her, Freddie, not once.

01:38:16.103 --> 01:38:19.800
Why would I talk about her to you, hm?

01:38:19.873 --> 01:38:23.741
Because she was a part of
your life and now she's gone.

01:38:26.713 --> 01:38:31.207
You know, the day before she killed
herself she said she wanted to meet me.

01:38:31.284 --> 01:38:34.219
That she had something
to tell me about you.

01:38:34.287 --> 01:38:37.882
I was such a coward,
I couldn't bring myself to face her.

01:38:37.958 --> 01:38:39.448
But...

01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:42.924
...what would she have said?

01:38:42.996 --> 01:38:46.090
You want to know the truth about me?

01:38:47.367 --> 01:38:49.858
The truth is that...

01:38:52.038 --> 01:38:54.029
...I never loved Sarah.

01:38:55.242 --> 01:38:56.732
I never loved her.

01:38:56.810 --> 01:38:59.040
You married her,
you had a child with her.

01:38:59.112 --> 01:39:02.206
Yes. Part of me. Part of me did, but...

01:39:02.282 --> 01:39:04.216
...the other part didn't.

01:39:04.284 --> 01:39:08.516
The part that found you,
the part that's sitting here right now.

01:39:08.588 --> 01:39:11.648
I love you. No, Olivia, I love you.

01:39:11.725 --> 01:39:13.693
That's the truth.

01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:16.160
That is the truth that matters.

01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:20.632
You could be in some other restaurant
with some other woman right now,

01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:22.292
talking about me that way.

01:39:22.369 --> 01:39:24.496
- No.
- Yes.

01:39:27.941 --> 01:39:31.672
It's inhuman to be so cold.

01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:38.612
He's back.

01:39:39.519 --> 01:39:42.784
After two years, he's got a new trick.

01:39:42.856 --> 01:39:45.518
They're saying it's
the best London's ever seen.

01:39:47.727 --> 01:39:50.195
You should see the look
on your face, Professor.

01:39:52.065 --> 01:39:53.999
You should go to him.

01:39:54.067 --> 01:39:56.592
You two deserve each other.

01:40:01.575 --> 01:40:05.511
But I'm afraid I'm booked. The Moscow
Ballet plays through next year.

01:40:05.579 --> 01:40:10.141
Then get rid of them. There will be
100 performances, no more, no less.

01:40:10.217 --> 01:40:12.708
Five performances a week, no matinees.

01:40:14.521 --> 01:40:17.547
That's what you'll
charge for each ticket. Good day.

01:40:20.927 --> 01:40:25.193
[Applause]

01:40:25.265 --> 01:40:28.701
[Footsteps on stage]

01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:44.910
Ladies and gentlemen, my first trick of
the evening involves considerable risk.

01:40:46.152 --> 01:40:47.517
Anyone in the audience

01:40:47.587 --> 01:40:50.420
who would be irrevocably
damaged by seeing a man drown

01:40:50.490 --> 01:40:52.082
should leave now.

01:40:52.158 --> 01:40:54.956
When I tell you the lady
who taught me this illusion

01:40:55.028 --> 01:40:57.019
actually died performing it,

01:40:57.097 --> 01:41:00.396
you'll understand the seriousness
of the dangers involved.

01:41:02.569 --> 01:41:04.969
- Let's begin.
- [Applause]

01:41:14.681 --> 01:41:17.309
In my travels, I have seen the future.

01:41:19.119 --> 01:41:22.714
And it is a strange future, indeed.

01:41:22.789 --> 01:41:24.950
The world, ladies and gentlemen,

01:41:25.025 --> 01:41:27.323
is on the brink of new

01:41:27.394 --> 01:41:29.123
and terrifying possibilities.

01:41:29.195 --> 01:41:31.186
[Taps cane]

01:41:38.204 --> 01:41:42.436
[Applause]

01:41:49.616 --> 01:41:53.074
What you're about to witness
is not magic.

01:41:54.254 --> 01:41:55.653
It's purely science.

01:41:55.722 --> 01:41:58.156
I'd like to invite you
to come up on stage now

01:41:58.224 --> 01:42:01.216
so that you can examine
the machine for yourselves.

01:42:17.177 --> 01:42:19.509
[Electrical zapping]

01:42:51.778 --> 01:42:54.508

01:42:54.581 --> 01:42:56.446
[Applause]

01:42:56.516 --> 01:42:58.347
Man's reach

01:42:58.418 --> 01:43:01.546
exceeds his imagination.

01:43:01.621 --> 01:43:05.216
[Applause, cheering]

01:43:12.832 --> 01:43:14.197
Bravo!

01:43:22.242 --> 01:43:24.972
One hundred performances. Why?

01:43:25.045 --> 01:43:26.603
Does his method dictate that?

01:43:26.679 --> 01:43:28.579
Is it a publicity move? What is it?

01:43:28.648 --> 01:43:31.014
He's a no-talent magician,
and they call him

01:43:31.084 --> 01:43:33.484
the bloody best in England. Why?

01:43:33.553 --> 01:43:36.317
Fifty yards in a second! In a second!

01:43:36.389 --> 01:43:39.483
And all that we know
is he uses a trap door.

01:43:39.559 --> 01:43:43.825
Brilliant! What is going on
under that stage? Huh?!

01:43:43.897 --> 01:43:46.331
Why can't you out-think him?

01:44:01.448 --> 01:44:06.647
They do this every night,
after each performance. Yeah?

01:44:06.719 --> 01:44:09.210
[Sighs]

01:44:32.946 --> 01:44:34.277
[Borden] Huh.

01:44:35.148 --> 01:44:38.117
- [Crumpling paper]
- We're done.

01:44:39.419 --> 01:44:40.977
All right?

01:44:42.288 --> 01:44:44.051
Let him have his trick.

01:44:44.124 --> 01:44:46.615
I don't need his secret.

01:44:46.693 --> 01:44:48.183
So...

01:44:49.696 --> 01:44:52.665
...don't go back there,
you leave him alone.

01:44:52.732 --> 01:44:55.997
Both of us... just leave him alone.

01:44:56.069 --> 01:44:57.696
We're done.

01:45:06.446 --> 01:45:08.505
[Angier] I told you, John.

01:45:08.581 --> 01:45:10.674
I don't want you backstage on this one.

01:45:12.318 --> 01:45:14.718
[Angier] I would like to
invite you onstage now

01:45:14.787 --> 01:45:17.483
so that you can examine
the machine for yourselves.

01:45:46.686 --> 01:45:50.417
- Hey, where do you think...?
- I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

01:45:55.695 --> 01:45:57.890
[Electric zapping]

01:45:59.432 --> 01:46:00.421
Who was that?

[Rumbling]

01:46:21.554 --> 01:46:24.045

[Silence]

01:46:56.990 --> 01:47:01.120
- [Muffled screaming]
- Hey! Where's the bloody key?!

01:47:01.194 --> 01:47:02.752
Where's the bloody key?!

01:47:02.829 --> 01:47:05.127
[Borden yelling]

01:47:05.198 --> 01:47:08.929
Where's the bloody key?!
He's bloody drowning!

01:47:18.177 --> 01:47:19.166
Hold on!

01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:21.304
[Screams]

01:47:24.484 --> 01:47:25.951
What have you done?

01:47:47.774 --> 01:47:53.212
[Man] Alfred Borden, you have been found
guilty of the murder of Robert Angier.

01:47:53.279 --> 01:47:57.511
You will be hanged
by the neck until dead.

01:47:57.583 --> 01:48:00.552
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

01:48:02.322 --> 01:48:04.483
[Owens] Mr. Cutter?

01:48:04.557 --> 01:48:06.184
Owens.

01:48:06.259 --> 01:48:09.092
Oh, thank you for coming, Mr. Owens.

01:48:09.162 --> 01:48:13.531
It has fallen to me to dispose
of Mr. Angier's equipment.

01:48:13.599 --> 01:48:15.191
But I notice from this manifest

01:48:15.268 --> 01:48:18.965
that Lord Caldlow has purchased
the bulk of the items.

01:48:19.038 --> 01:48:22.337
Mr. Cutter, if you need to know
where to deliver these items...

01:48:22.408 --> 01:48:26.003
No, it's just there is
one particular item,

01:48:26.946 --> 01:48:29.540
this item, in fact,

01:48:29.615 --> 01:48:31.879
- I would like to...
- You would like to...

01:48:31.951 --> 01:48:33.043
...buy.

01:48:33.119 --> 01:48:35.019
- Buy yourself?
- Yeah, I suppose so.

01:48:36.255 --> 01:48:38.189
- This is the machine?
- Yes.

01:48:38.257 --> 01:48:40.487
Well, I'm afraid
Lord Caldlow was adamant

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:42.790
about purchasing this particular item.

01:48:42.862 --> 01:48:45.956
Do you think I could
talk to Lord Caldlow in person?

01:48:46.032 --> 01:48:48.796
Out of the question, I'm afraid.

01:48:51.237 --> 01:48:53.137
Of course,

01:48:53.206 --> 01:48:56.437
I suppose if, in the course
of your delivery arrangements,

01:48:56.509 --> 01:49:00.969
your paths were to cross,
I can't stop you speaking your mind.

01:49:01.948 --> 01:49:03.074
Thank you.

01:49:03.216 --> 01:49:04.547
[Door opens]

01:49:04.650 --> 01:49:06.811
- [Man] Still here, Borden?
- For now.

01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:10.389
You got a visitor. Lord Caldlow.

01:49:10.456 --> 01:49:12.549
With a little girl.

01:49:20.833 --> 01:49:22.733
Jess?

01:49:22.802 --> 01:49:24.429
Hello, my love.

01:49:24.504 --> 01:49:27.962
How are you? I've missed you so much.

01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:30.167
Fallon's missed you too. We both have.

01:49:30.243 --> 01:49:32.575
Daddy, can I come in there?

01:49:33.212 --> 01:49:35.840
Not right now. Not right now, darling.

01:49:35.915 --> 01:49:38.179
No, but everything
is gonna be all right.

01:49:39.752 --> 01:49:41.481
You must be Lord Caldlow?

01:49:41.554 --> 01:49:45.285
Caldlow. Yes, I am. I always have been.

01:49:50.329 --> 01:49:52.524
They flatter you with all those chains.

01:49:52.598 --> 01:49:55.624
Don't they know you can't escape
without your rubber ball?

01:49:55.701 --> 01:49:58.693
I pulled you out... out of that tank.

01:49:58.771 --> 01:50:02.605
All I wanted to do was prove
that I was a better magician.

01:50:02.675 --> 01:50:04.575
But you couldn't leave me alone.

01:50:06.078 --> 01:50:08.171
I don't know what you've done.

01:50:10.082 --> 01:50:13.779
But you're not afraid to get
your hands dirty anymore, are you?

01:50:13.853 --> 01:50:17.118
No, not anymore. And I win.

01:50:17.190 --> 01:50:20.523
No one cares about the man
in the box, the man who disappears.

01:50:20.593 --> 01:50:21.719
You win?

01:50:23.162 --> 01:50:27.826
This ain't a bloody competition
anymore. This is my little girl's life.

01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:30.892
And don't you dare
put her in the middle of this.

01:50:30.970 --> 01:50:33.962
Oh, I know how hard it is
to have someone so special

01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:36.406
taken away from you, don't I, Borden?

01:50:37.410 --> 01:50:40.140
And you can't take it
with you, now, can you?

01:50:40.213 --> 01:50:42.113
Oh, she'll be looked after.

01:50:42.181 --> 01:50:44.206
Goodbye, Professor. Come on, darling.

01:50:44.283 --> 01:50:46.046
No, no, no, no, stop, my darling.

01:50:46.118 --> 01:50:48.245
Look, here.

01:50:49.789 --> 01:50:53.054
That's what you're after.
That's what this is about.

01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:55.225
Take it.

01:50:55.294 --> 01:50:56.989
- Your secret?
- Yeah.

01:51:00.199 --> 01:51:03.760
You always were the better magician.
We both know that.

01:51:04.403 --> 01:51:06.997
Whatever your secret was,
you have to agree,

01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:09.471
mine is better.

01:51:11.177 --> 01:51:14.544
Don't do this. Don't do this,
Angier. Jess, Jess!

01:51:14.614 --> 01:51:18.141
Jess, I'm gonna take you
home soon. I promise.

01:51:18.217 --> 01:51:20.777
- For God's sake.
- I promise. Look!

01:51:24.624 --> 01:51:28.219
I promise. I love you, Jess.

01:51:28.294 --> 01:51:29.955
I love you.

01:51:30.029 --> 01:51:31.656
- Come on.
- I love you.

01:51:31.731 --> 01:51:33.426
I love you, Jess.

01:51:33.499 --> 01:51:35.831
Angier! Angier!

01:51:35.902 --> 01:51:37.995
What, do you think
this place can hold me?

01:51:38.070 --> 01:51:41.096
Angier! They're gonna bloody hang me!

01:51:41.173 --> 01:51:43.698
And you can put a stop to this now!

01:51:44.343 --> 01:51:46.538
Listen! Listen! That man...

01:51:46.612 --> 01:51:48.978
Listen, that man is
the one I'm in for killing!

01:51:49.048 --> 01:51:53.382
Listen! If he's alive, I'm not guilty!

01:51:53.452 --> 01:51:55.716
- I'm not guilty!
- I don't care!

01:51:55.788 --> 01:51:57.881
- Get hold of him.
- Angier!

01:52:02.562 --> 01:52:05.122
Run along now.

01:52:05.197 --> 01:52:07.722
Sir, there's a gentleman waiting.

01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:27.280
- Dear God.
- Hello, Cutter.

01:52:28.254 --> 01:52:30.688
You're still alive.

01:52:30.756 --> 01:52:32.621
How is it you're still alive?

01:52:32.692 --> 01:52:35.092
I saw you on a slab, for God's sake.

01:52:38.097 --> 01:52:40.122
- Child.
- Good night, sir.

01:52:40.199 --> 01:52:42.167
[Angier] Good night, Jess.

01:52:43.402 --> 01:52:45.063
I've seen her before.

01:52:45.137 --> 01:52:47.662
I saw her in court with...

01:52:48.608 --> 01:52:50.235
...Fallon.

01:52:52.345 --> 01:52:54.939
- What have you done?
- She needs looking after.

01:52:55.014 --> 01:52:57.505
She needs her father.

01:52:57.583 --> 01:53:00.552
You're letting him hang,
and I helped you.

01:53:00.620 --> 01:53:05.557
I came here to beg Lord Caldlow
to let me destroy that machine.

01:53:07.026 --> 01:53:10.462
I am not going to beg you for anything.

01:53:10.529 --> 01:53:13.794
You don't have to. I'm gonna
make sure it is never used again.

01:53:14.934 --> 01:53:18.028
Then, Lord Caldlow...

01:53:20.573 --> 01:53:22.632
...where do you want me to deliver it?

01:53:22.708 --> 01:53:26.474
My theater. It belongs
with the prestige materials.

01:53:26.946 --> 01:53:29.540
John, I tried not to involve you.

01:53:42.495 --> 01:53:44.759
So...

01:53:46.799 --> 01:53:49.393
We go alone now.

01:53:49.468 --> 01:53:51.902
Both of us.

01:53:54.707 --> 01:53:58.108
I mean, I don't have
as far to go as you.

01:54:03.416 --> 01:54:04.747
No.

01:54:06.285 --> 01:54:09.345
You were right. I should have
left him to his damn trick.

01:54:11.123 --> 01:54:13.216
I'm sorry.

01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:17.092
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

01:54:18.230 --> 01:54:20.960
I'm sorry about Sarah.

01:54:22.068 --> 01:54:25.526
Didn't mean to hurt her, I didn't.

01:54:27.406 --> 01:54:31.740
You go live your life in full now,
all right? You live for both of us.

01:54:40.586 --> 01:54:42.076
Goodbye.

01:55:27.867 --> 01:55:30.301
Are you watching closely?

01:56:01.667 --> 01:56:03.601
Put it down on the end.

01:56:37.002 --> 01:56:40.768
Take a minute to consider
your achievement.

01:56:41.841 --> 01:56:44.639
I once told you about a sailor

01:56:44.710 --> 01:56:47.008
who described drowning to me.

01:56:47.079 --> 01:56:49.274
Yes, he said it was like going home.

01:56:50.382 --> 01:56:54.148
I was lying. He said it was agony.

01:57:33.893 --> 01:57:38.057
[Man] Alfred Borden, this day,
in the name of the king

01:57:38.130 --> 01:57:40.121
and the High Court of England,

01:57:40.199 --> 01:57:42.030
you will meet your end.

01:57:44.136 --> 01:57:46.161
No one cares about the man in the box.

01:57:51.010 --> 01:57:52.739
Cutter?

01:57:57.416 --> 01:57:58.940
Cutter!

01:58:00.819 --> 01:58:03.083
[Man] Do you have anything to say?

01:58:07.826 --> 01:58:09.225
Abracadabra.

01:58:15.401 --> 01:58:16.959
[Gunshot]

01:58:20.706 --> 01:58:22.970
[Moans]

01:58:32.952 --> 01:58:35.978
[Angier moans]

01:58:45.864 --> 01:58:48.594
A brother? A twin?

01:58:50.436 --> 01:58:52.802
You were Fallon.

01:58:54.306 --> 01:58:56.968
- The whole time?
- No.

01:58:58.010 --> 01:59:00.342
We were both Fallon.

01:59:00.412 --> 01:59:02.312
We were both Borden.

01:59:07.686 --> 01:59:10.655
Were you the one who went into the box?

01:59:10.723 --> 01:59:12.418
Or the one who came back out?

01:59:13.726 --> 01:59:16.024
We took turns.

01:59:20.833 --> 01:59:22.892
The trick is where we would swap.

01:59:29.108 --> 01:59:31.008
Cutter knew. Cutter knew.

01:59:31.076 --> 01:59:33.340
But I told him it was
too simple, too easy.

01:59:34.546 --> 01:59:35.535
No.

01:59:37.082 --> 01:59:39.050
Simple, maybe, but not easy.

01:59:39.118 --> 01:59:42.884
There's nothing easy
about two men sharing one life.

01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:51.757
I don't understand,
how it can be bleeding again?

01:59:55.234 --> 01:59:58.032
Wha... What about Olivia and your wife?

01:59:59.038 --> 02:00:00.938
We each loved one of them.

02:00:04.576 --> 02:00:07.306
I loved Sarah.

02:00:07.379 --> 02:00:09.904
He loved Olivia.

02:00:09.982 --> 02:00:12.416
We each had half of a full life,

02:00:12.484 --> 02:00:15.476
really, which was enough for us...

02:00:15.554 --> 02:00:16.543
...just.

02:00:19.191 --> 02:00:20.920
But not for them.

02:00:23.495 --> 02:00:25.725
See, sacrifice, Robert,

02:00:25.798 --> 02:00:28.528
that's the price of a good trick.

02:00:30.569 --> 02:00:33.129
You wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

02:00:33.205 --> 02:00:36.333
[Groaning]

02:00:36.408 --> 02:00:38.342
I've... I've made sacrifices.

02:00:38.410 --> 02:00:40.378
- No.
- Yes.

02:00:40.846 --> 02:00:43.940
It takes nothing
to steal another man's work.

02:00:44.016 --> 02:00:46.780
Yeah, it takes everything.

02:01:06.839 --> 02:01:08.966
No, no, wait, I'm not...

02:01:09.041 --> 02:01:10.702
[gunshot]

02:01:15.647 --> 02:01:18.275
It took courage.

02:01:20.285 --> 02:01:23.482
It took courage to climb
into that machine every night,

02:01:24.289 --> 02:01:26.723
not knowing...

02:01:26.792 --> 02:01:28.919
...if I'd be the man in the box...

02:01:31.964 --> 02:01:33.226
...or in the prestige.

02:01:34.566 --> 02:01:37.592
Do you want to see...

02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:39.967
...what it cost me?

02:01:40.038 --> 02:01:42.802
You didn't see where you are, did you?

02:01:43.709 --> 02:01:46.109
Look. Look.

02:01:47.212 --> 02:01:48.702
I don't care.

02:01:53.418 --> 02:01:56.979
You went halfway around the world.

02:01:57.055 --> 02:01:59.819
You spent a fortune.

02:02:01.894 --> 02:02:04.419
You did terrible things.

02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:07.898
Really terrible things, Robert.

02:02:09.935 --> 02:02:11.425
And all for nothing.

02:02:12.404 --> 02:02:13.598
For nothing?

02:02:13.672 --> 02:02:15.003
[Borden] Yeah.

02:02:18.677 --> 02:02:21.305
You never understood...

02:02:21.380 --> 02:02:23.371
...why we did this.

02:02:26.485 --> 02:02:29.045
The audience knows the truth.

02:02:30.189 --> 02:02:32.623
The world is simple.

02:02:32.691 --> 02:02:34.420
It's miserable.

02:02:34.493 --> 02:02:38.190
Solid... Solid all the way through.

02:02:40.532 --> 02:02:42.864
But if you could fool them,

02:02:42.935 --> 02:02:45.096
even for a second...

02:02:46.638 --> 02:02:49.038
...then you could make them wonder.

02:02:50.175 --> 02:02:52.370
And then you...

02:02:52.444 --> 02:02:54.674
Then you got to see something

02:02:54.746 --> 02:02:56.407
very special.

02:03:00.719 --> 02:03:03.244
You really don't know.

02:03:06.325 --> 02:03:07.986
It was...

02:03:09.061 --> 02:03:12.030
...it was the look on their faces.

02:03:14.967 --> 02:03:16.764
[Inhales deeply]

02:03:27.212 --> 02:03:32.047
<i>[Cutter] Every magic trick</i>
<i>consists of three parts, or acts.</i>

02:03:35.487 --> 02:03:38.945
<i>The first part is called "the pledge."</i>

02:03:39.024 --> 02:03:41.788
<i>The magician shows you</i>
<i>something ordinary.</i>

02:03:42.928 --> 02:03:45.863
<i>The second act is called "the turn."</i>

02:03:47.332 --> 02:03:50.199
<i>The magician takes</i>
<i>the ordinary something</i>

02:03:50.269 --> 02:03:53.136
<i>and makes it into</i>
<i>something extraordinary.</i>

02:03:54.473 --> 02:03:58.375
<i>But you wouldn't clap yet,</i>
<i>because making something disappear</i>

02:03:58.443 --> 02:04:02.539
<i>isn't enough. You have to bring it back.</i>

02:04:36.982 --> 02:04:39.416
<i>Now you're looking for the secret.</i>

02:04:42.354 --> 02:04:46.085
<i>But you won't find it, because,</i>
<i>of course, you're not really looking.</i>

02:04:49.194 --> 02:04:52.630
<i>You don't really want to work it out.</i>

02:04:55.434 --> 02:04:57.732
<i>You want to be fooled.</i>

02:04:58.305 --> 02:05:04.909
