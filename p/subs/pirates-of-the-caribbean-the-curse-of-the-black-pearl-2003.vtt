WEBVTT

00:42.625 --> 00:45.627
Yo ho
Yo ho

00:45.712 --> 00:48.756
A pirate's life for me

00:48.798 --> 00:53.594
We extort, we pilfer
We filch, we sack

00:53.636 --> 00:56.138
- Drink...
- Quiet, missy!

00:56.222 --> 00:58.599
Cursed pirates sail these waters.

00:58.641 --> 01:00.934
You don't want to bring
them down on us, do ya?

01:00.977 --> 01:02.811
Mr Gibbs, that will do.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.480
She was singing about pirates!

01:05.522 --> 01:07.649
Bad luck to be singing about pirates

01:07.734 --> 01:10.903
with us mired in this unnatural fog,
mark my words.

01:10.987 --> 01:12.321
Consider them marked.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.492
- On your way.
- Aye, Lieutenant.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.660
Bad luck to have a woman on board, too.

01:18.703 --> 01:20.954
Even a miniature one.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.541
I think it'd be rather exciting
to meet a pirate.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.337
Think again, Miss Swann.

01:28.421 --> 01:31.256
Vile and dissolute creatures,
the lot of 'em.

01:31.341 --> 01:34.468
I intend to see to it that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

01:34.511 --> 01:37.137
or wears a pirate brand
gets what he deserves.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.516
A short drop and a sudden stop.

01:44.562 --> 01:47.189
Lieutenant Norrington,
I appreciate your fervour,

01:47.232 --> 01:51.860
but I'm concerned about the effect
this subject will have upon my daughter.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.737
My apologies, Governor Swann.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.031
Actually, I find it all fascinating.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.866
Yes. That's what concerns me.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.146
Look! A boy!

02:27.230 --> 02:28.564
There's a boy in the water!

02:31.025 --> 02:32.359
Man overboard!

02:34.237 --> 02:35.946
Man the ropes!
Fetch a hook!

02:36.781 --> 02:38.115
Haul him aboard!

02:46.666 --> 02:48.584
He's still breathing.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.919
Mary, Mother of God!

02:57.468 --> 02:58.927
What happened here?

03:00.430 --> 03:04.141
Most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

03:06.603 --> 03:07.811
Lot of good it did them.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.439
Everyone's thinking it,
I'm just saying it.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.524
Pirates!

03:12.609 --> 03:15.444
There's no proof of that!

03:15.486 --> 03:17.029
It was probably an accident.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.407
Rouse the captain immediately.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.367
- Aye, sir.
- Heave to and take in sail.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.119
- Lower the boats.
- Heave to!

03:26.289 --> 03:28.624
Elizabeth, I want you
to accompany the boy.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.126
He'll be in your charge.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.836
Take care of him.

03:52.148 --> 03:53.815
It's OK.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.652
My name's Elizabeth Swann.

03:57.987 --> 03:59.404
Will Turner.

04:00.406 --> 04:02.324
I'm watching over you, Will.

04:15.129 --> 04:16.838
You're a pirate!

04:17.298 --> 04:19.091
Has he said anything?

04:19.175 --> 04:20.759
His name's William Turner.

04:20.843 --> 04:22.344
That's all I found out.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.388
Take him below.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.084
Elizabeth!

05:38.588 --> 05:39.755
Are you all right?

05:41.174 --> 05:42.299
Are you decent?

05:42.925 --> 05:43.925
Yes.

05:43.968 --> 05:44.968
Yes?

05:46.471 --> 05:47.929
Still in bed at this hour?

05:49.974 --> 05:51.433
It's a beautiful day.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.354
I have a gift for you.

05:58.316 --> 06:01.276
- Oh, it's beautiful!
- Isn't it?

06:02.945 --> 06:04.905
May I inquire as to the occasion?

06:04.947 --> 06:08.033
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

06:09.952 --> 06:10.994
Go on.

06:14.457 --> 06:15.957
Actually, I...

06:17.627 --> 06:20.253
I had hoped you might wear it
for the ceremony today.

06:20.296 --> 06:21.588
Ceremony?

06:21.631 --> 06:24.049
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.300
I knew it!

06:25.385 --> 06:28.678
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.680
A fine gentleman, don't you think?

06:31.474 --> 06:32.974
He fancies you, you know.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.060
Elizabeth?

06:35.144 --> 06:36.812
How's it coming?

06:36.896 --> 06:38.647
It's difficult to say.

06:38.689 --> 06:41.817
I'm told it's the
latest fashion in London.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.235
Well, women in London

06:43.319 --> 06:44.986
must've learned not to breathe!

06:47.156 --> 06:48.824
My Lord, you have a visitor.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.343
Mr Turner.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.845
Good to see you again.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.054
Good day, sir.

07:12.682 --> 07:13.849
I have your order.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.522
Well...

07:20.606 --> 07:22.357
The blade is folded steel.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.444
That's gold filigree
laid into the handle.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.404
If I may?

07:29.574 --> 07:31.032
Perfectly balanced.

07:31.826 --> 07:34.119
The tang is nearly
the full width of the blade.

07:37.039 --> 07:39.207
Impressive. Very impressive.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.584
Very nice.

07:41.252 --> 07:44.254
Commodore Norrington's going
to be very pleased with this.

07:45.381 --> 07:47.883
Do pass my compliments
onto your master.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.052
I shall.

07:52.513 --> 07:55.849
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

07:57.351 --> 08:00.854
Elizabeth! You look absolutely stunning.

08:00.897 --> 08:01.897
Will.

08:03.065 --> 08:04.733
It's so good to see you.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.694
I had a dream about you last night.

08:07.737 --> 08:08.820
About me?

08:08.905 --> 08:10.489
Is it entirely proper for you...

08:10.573 --> 08:12.407
About the day we met.
Do you remember?

08:12.450 --> 08:15.243
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

08:15.286 --> 08:17.829
How many times must I ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

08:17.914 --> 08:20.165
At least once more, Miss Swann.

08:20.249 --> 08:22.083
As always.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.418
Now, you see?

08:23.461 --> 08:25.754
At least the boy
has a sense of propriety.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.088
We really must be going.

08:27.131 --> 08:28.131
Come on.

08:29.467 --> 08:30.759
Good day, Mr Turner.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.345
Come along!

08:36.724 --> 08:37.933
Good day...

08:40.770 --> 08:42.270
...Elizabeth.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.654
Hold up there, you!

10:16.324 --> 10:19.659
It's a shilling to tie up
your boat to the dock.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.371
And I shall need to know your name.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.335
What do you say to three shillings,

10:28.377 --> 10:29.628
and we forget the name?

10:33.090 --> 10:35.300
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr Smith.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.588
Two paces... march!

11:16.133 --> 11:18.134
Right about... face!

11:20.680 --> 11:23.431
Present... arms!

11:47.707 --> 11:50.458
This dock is off limits to civilians.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.293
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.

11:52.336 --> 11:55.046
If I see one,
I shall inform you immediately.

11:58.634 --> 12:02.262
Apparently, there's some high-toned
and fancy to-do up at the fort, eh?

12:02.304 --> 12:05.473
How could it be two upstanding
gentlemen, such as yourselves,

12:05.558 --> 12:07.517
did not merit an invitation?

12:07.601 --> 12:10.770
Someone has to make sure this dock
stays off limit to civilians.

12:10.813 --> 12:13.189
It's a fine goal, to be sure.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.233
But it seems to me, a...

12:15.317 --> 12:17.068
...a ship like that...

12:17.153 --> 12:20.155
makes this one here
a bit superfluous, really.

12:20.197 --> 12:23.324
Oh, the Dauntless is the power
in these waters, true enough,

12:23.367 --> 12:27.328
but there's no ship that can match
the Interceptor for speed.

12:27.371 --> 12:28.455
I've heard of one.

12:28.497 --> 12:31.166
It's supposed to be very fast,
nigh uncatchable.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.001
The Black Pearl.

12:35.546 --> 12:37.046
There's no real ship

12:37.131 --> 12:38.798
that can match the Interceptor.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.510
The Black Pearl is a real ship.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.179
No, it's not.

12:44.221 --> 12:45.555
Yes, it is. I've seen it!

12:46.307 --> 12:47.390
You've seen it?

12:47.475 --> 12:48.516
Yes.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.518
You haven't seen it!

12:50.561 --> 12:51.644
Yes, I have!

12:51.687 --> 12:53.146
You've seen a ship

12:53.189 --> 12:55.190
with black sails,

12:55.274 --> 12:56.941
that's crewed by the damned,

12:57.026 --> 12:59.527
and captained by a man so evil

12:59.570 --> 13:02.197
that hell itself spat him back out?

13:02.990 --> 13:05.241
No.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.411
But I have seen a ship with black sails.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.372
And no ship that's
not crewed by the damned,

13:11.457 --> 13:14.334
and captained by a man so evil
that hell spat him back out

13:14.376 --> 13:16.044
could possibly have black sails,

13:16.086 --> 13:18.213
therefore couldn't possibly
be any other ship

13:18.297 --> 13:21.716
than the Black Pearl,
is that what you're saying?

13:21.759 --> 13:22.884
No.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.219
Like I said,

13:24.303 --> 13:27.514
there's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor...

13:29.975 --> 13:30.975
Hey!

13:32.436 --> 13:33.436
You!

13:34.563 --> 13:35.605
Get away from there!

13:35.689 --> 13:38.066
You don't have permission
to be aboard there!

13:38.108 --> 13:39.818
Sorry. It's such a pretty boat.

13:39.902 --> 13:40.902
Ship!

13:41.654 --> 13:42.654
What's your name?

13:42.738 --> 13:43.738
Smith!

13:43.781 --> 13:45.532
Or Smithy, if you like.

13:45.574 --> 13:48.868
What's your purpose in Port Royal,
Mr Smith?

13:48.911 --> 13:49.911
Yeah, and no lies!

13:49.995 --> 13:51.454
All right then.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.539
I confess.

13:52.957 --> 13:56.251
It is my intention to commandeer
one of these ships, pick up a crew

13:56.335 --> 13:59.754
in Tortuga to rape, pillage, and pilfer
my weasely black guts out.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.714
I said, no lies!

14:01.757 --> 14:03.675
I think he's telling the truth.

14:03.759 --> 14:05.301
If he were telling the truth,

14:05.386 --> 14:06.636
he wouldn't have told us.

14:07.596 --> 14:11.140
Unless he knew you wouldn't believe
the truth, even if he told it to you.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.236
May I have a moment?

14:32.204 --> 14:33.955
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.790
Yes.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.544
I apologise if I seem forward,

14:39.628 --> 14:41.713
but I must speak my mind.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.594
This promotion throws into sharp relief

14:47.636 --> 14:50.597
that which I have not yet achieved.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.809
A marriage to a fine woman.

14:56.353 --> 14:59.022
You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.

14:59.607 --> 15:00.982
I can't breathe.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.859
Yes, I...

15:02.943 --> 15:04.444
I'm a bit nervous myself.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.032
And then they made me their chief.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.036
Elizabeth?

15:15.748 --> 15:16.748
Elizabeth!

15:19.001 --> 15:21.711
The rocks!
Sir, it's a miracle she missed them!

15:24.214 --> 15:26.507
- Will you be saving her, then?
- I can't swim!

15:28.677 --> 15:30.678
Pearl of the King's Navy, you are!

15:30.721 --> 15:32.430
Do not lose these!

15:46.904 --> 15:48.112
What was that?

16:30.948 --> 16:31.948
I got her!

16:33.325 --> 16:34.492
She's not breathing!

16:34.576 --> 16:35.576
Move!

16:42.668 --> 16:44.419
I never would've thought of that.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.754
Clearly you've never been to Singapore.

16:52.344 --> 16:53.970
Where did you get that?

16:56.181 --> 16:57.598
On your feet.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.019
Elizabeth!

17:02.354 --> 17:04.355
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.904
- Shoot him!
- Father! Commodore...

17:11.946 --> 17:13.990
...do you intend to kill my rescuer?

17:21.373 --> 17:23.165
I believe thanks are in order.

17:27.796 --> 17:30.631
Had a brush with the East India
Trading Company, did we?

17:30.674 --> 17:31.966
Pirate?

17:33.218 --> 17:34.510
Hang him.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.346
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

17:38.599 --> 17:39.932
Well, well.

17:39.975 --> 17:42.477
Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

17:42.561 --> 17:45.188
Captain Jack Sparrow,
if you please, sir.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.148
Well, I don't see your ship...

17:47.191 --> 17:48.399
...captain.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.818
I'm in the market, as it were.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.862
He said he'd come to commandeer one.

17:52.946 --> 17:55.740
I told you he was telling the truth.
These are his, sir.

17:59.203 --> 18:02.330
No additional shots nor powder.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.000
A compass that doesn't point north.

18:11.006 --> 18:13.674
And I half expected it
to be made from wood.

18:16.178 --> 18:19.097
You are, without doubt,
the worst pirate I've heard of.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.516
But you have heard of me.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.479
Commodore, I really must protest!

18:27.189 --> 18:28.689
Carefully, lieutenant.

18:28.732 --> 18:31.025
Pirate or not, this man saved my life!

18:31.068 --> 18:34.654
One good deed is not enough to redeem
a man of a lifetime of wickedness!

18:34.696 --> 18:36.447
But it seems enough to condemn him.

18:36.532 --> 18:37.865
Indeed.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.785
Finally.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.538
Wait, don't shoot!

18:43.580 --> 18:44.914
I knew you'd warm up to me.

18:44.998 --> 18:47.792
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.544
And my hat.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.504
Commodore.

18:54.424 --> 18:57.426
- Elizabeth. It is Elizabeth, isn't it?
- It's Miss Swann.

18:57.511 --> 19:00.054
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.

19:00.097 --> 19:02.723
Come, dear, we don't have all day.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.476
Now, if you'll be very kind.

19:22.494 --> 19:23.911
Easy on the goods, darling.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.789
You're despicable.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.875
Sticks and stones, love.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.501
I saved your life, you save mine.

19:30.586 --> 19:31.586
We're square.

19:32.588 --> 19:33.796
Gentlemen...

19:33.881 --> 19:35.339
...my lady...

19:35.424 --> 19:38.759
...you will always remember this
as the day you almost caught...

19:38.844 --> 19:41.262
...Captain Jack Sparrow!

19:59.865 --> 20:01.324
Now, will you shoot him?

20:01.408 --> 20:03.075
Open fire!

20:10.375 --> 20:11.792
Burn his heels!

20:27.226 --> 20:29.227
Take cover, men!

20:29.311 --> 20:31.229
Gillette...

20:31.313 --> 20:34.148
...Mr Sparrow has a dawn
appointment with the gallows.

20:34.524 --> 20:36.525
I would hate for him to miss it.

20:40.530 --> 20:41.948
Search upstairs!

20:43.283 --> 20:44.492
Look lively, men!

22:17.753 --> 22:19.879
Right where I left you.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.262
Not where I left you.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.691
You're the one they're hunting.

22:41.693 --> 22:42.860
The pirate!

22:43.612 --> 22:46.739
You seem somewhat familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

22:46.782 --> 22:49.533
I make a point of avoiding
familiarity with pirates.

22:50.619 --> 22:53.287
It would be a shame to put
a black mark on your record.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.872
So if you'll excuse me...

22:58.377 --> 23:00.544
Do you think this wise, boy?

23:01.505 --> 23:04.673
Crossing blades with a pirate?

23:04.758 --> 23:06.133
You threatened Miss Swann.

23:09.179 --> 23:10.513
Only a little.

23:24.111 --> 23:27.279
You know what you're doing,
I'll give you that. Excellent form.

23:28.156 --> 23:29.865
But how's your footwork?

23:29.950 --> 23:32.034
If I step here...

23:33.412 --> 23:34.829
Very good.

23:34.871 --> 23:36.956
And now I step again.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.003
Ta.

24:02.899 --> 24:04.567
That is a wonderful trick.

24:05.861 --> 24:09.530
Except, once again,
you are between me and my way out.

24:09.614 --> 24:10.739
And now...

24:11.366 --> 24:12.783
...you have no weapon.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.765
Who makes all these?

24:38.226 --> 24:39.560
I do.

24:39.644 --> 24:41.896
And I practice with them...

24:42.439 --> 24:43.564
...three hours a day.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.568
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.

24:54.242 --> 24:57.203
Or... perhaps the reason
you practice three hours a day

24:57.245 --> 24:59.079
is that you already found one,

24:59.164 --> 25:02.750
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.294
You're not a eunuch, are you?

25:05.378 --> 25:08.297
I practice three hours a day
so that when I meet a pirate,

25:08.381 --> 25:09.757
I can kill him!

26:27.127 --> 26:28.127
You cheated.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.461
Pirate.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.009
- Move away!
- No.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.427
Please move?

26:36.511 --> 26:37.511
No!

26:37.554 --> 26:40.347
I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

26:42.892 --> 26:44.893
This shot is not meant for you.

26:55.238 --> 26:57.239
There he is! Over here!

26:59.242 --> 27:01.201
Excellent work, Mr Brown.

27:02.203 --> 27:05.080
You've assisted in the capture
of a dangerous fugitive.

27:05.165 --> 27:07.458
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.045
I trust you will always remember
that this is the day

27:11.129 --> 27:14.548
Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.

27:14.591 --> 27:16.342
Take him away.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.557
- Come here, boy!
- Smell it?

27:23.600 --> 27:26.685
- Come here, boy!
- You want a nice, juicy bone?

27:26.728 --> 27:29.146
- Hey!
- Come here, boy!

27:29.230 --> 27:31.732
- Come here, boy!
- You can keep doing that forever.

27:31.816 --> 27:34.026
The dog is never going to move.

27:34.069 --> 27:38.364
Well, excuse us if we haven't resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet!

27:39.407 --> 27:40.824
Come on!

27:45.080 --> 27:46.372
There you go, miss.

27:46.414 --> 27:49.208
It was a difficult day for you,
I'm sure.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.919
I suspected Commodore Norrington
would propose,

27:52.003 --> 27:54.588
but I must admit,
I wasn't entirely prepared for it.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.924
I meant you being
threatened by that pirate!

27:56.966 --> 27:58.217
Sounds terrifying!

27:58.968 --> 28:01.720
Oh... Yes, it was terrifying.

28:01.763 --> 28:03.764
But... the Commodore proposed!

28:03.848 --> 28:05.432
Fancy that.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.101
Now that's a smart match, miss,

28:07.185 --> 28:09.311
if it's not too bold to say.

28:09.396 --> 28:10.771
It is a smart match.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.732
He's a fine man.

28:15.026 --> 28:17.528
He's what any woman
should dream of marrying.

28:18.613 --> 28:20.739
Well, that Will Turner,

28:20.782 --> 28:22.950
he's a fine man, too.

28:22.992 --> 28:24.785
That is too bold.

28:24.869 --> 28:26.954
Well, beggin' your pardon, miss.

28:26.996 --> 28:28.664
It was not my place.

29:17.714 --> 29:20.716
Has my daughter given
you an answer yet?

29:20.800 --> 29:22.509
No, she hasn't.

29:22.552 --> 29:24.887
Well, she has had a very trying day.

29:26.556 --> 29:28.724
Ghastly weather, don't you think?

29:28.808 --> 29:30.684
Bleak. Really bleak.

29:32.479 --> 29:33.479
What's that?

29:34.564 --> 29:36.440
Cannon fire!

29:37.817 --> 29:39.693
Return fire!

29:39.736 --> 29:41.487
I know those guns!

29:47.744 --> 29:49.745
It's the Pearl!

29:49.829 --> 29:51.538
Black Pearl?

29:54.042 --> 29:55.667
I've heard stories.

29:55.710 --> 29:59.713
She's been preying on ships and
settlements for near ten years.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.381
Never leaves any survivors.

30:01.466 --> 30:02.883
No survivors.

30:02.926 --> 30:05.761
Then where do the stories
come from, I wonder?

30:15.063 --> 30:16.814
Clear the dock!

30:38.628 --> 30:40.254
On your oars!

31:38.479 --> 31:40.063
Sight the muzzle flash.

31:40.148 --> 31:41.148
Aim for the flashes.

31:41.232 --> 31:43.317
I need a full spread, fore and aft.

31:43.359 --> 31:45.027
Mr Stevens, more cartridges!

31:45.904 --> 31:49.031
Governor!
Barricade yourself in my office.

31:49.991 --> 31:50.991
Good God!

31:51.034 --> 31:52.659
That's an order.

32:10.887 --> 32:11.887
Don't!

32:12.680 --> 32:13.847
Hello, chum.

32:18.102 --> 32:19.645
Up there! Go!

32:29.447 --> 32:32.115
Miss! They've come to kidnap you!

32:32.200 --> 32:34.785
- What?
- You're the governor's daughter!

32:34.869 --> 32:36.036
In here!

32:37.705 --> 32:41.959
They haven't seen you. Hide, and the
first chance you get, run to the fort!

32:51.469 --> 32:53.095
Got ya! Haven't I?

32:58.518 --> 33:00.143
No! No! It's hot!

33:00.228 --> 33:02.062
- I'm burning!
- Come on!

33:06.526 --> 33:07.859
Come on, me lads!

33:34.595 --> 33:36.430
Come out!

33:46.024 --> 33:48.859
We know you're here, poppet.

33:49.944 --> 33:51.111
Poppet.

33:51.195 --> 33:52.237
Come out...

33:53.156 --> 33:55.365
...and we promise we won't hurt you.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.700
Eh?

33:58.453 --> 34:00.454
We will find you, poppet.

34:01.497 --> 34:03.915
You've got something of ours,

34:03.958 --> 34:05.751
and it calls to us.

34:11.466 --> 34:13.967
The gold calls to us.

34:15.011 --> 34:16.178
The gold.

34:22.310 --> 34:24.351
Hello, poppet.

34:24.896 --> 34:25.896
Parley!

34:26.606 --> 34:27.813
What?

34:27.857 --> 34:29.024
Parley.

34:29.108 --> 34:30.525
I invoke the right of parley.

34:30.610 --> 34:34.529
According to the code of brethren, set
down by pirates Morgan and Bartholomew,

34:34.614 --> 34:37.699
- you have to take me to your captain.
- I know the code.

34:37.784 --> 34:40.494
If an adversary demands parley,
you can do them no harm

34:40.536 --> 34:43.330
- until the parley is complete.
- To blazes with the code!

34:43.414 --> 34:45.373
She wants to be taken to the captain.

34:46.876 --> 34:49.168
And she'll go, without a fuss.

34:50.213 --> 34:53.255
We must honour the code.

35:03.893 --> 35:05.268
Say goodbye!

35:09.982 --> 35:11.233
Goodbye.

35:15.363 --> 35:17.155
- Come on!
- Elizabeth!

35:18.783 --> 35:19.783
Well!

35:26.582 --> 35:28.166
Out of my way, scum!

35:40.805 --> 35:43.682
My sympathies, friend.
You've no manner of luck at all.

36:06.289 --> 36:07.581
Come on, doggy!

36:07.623 --> 36:09.499
It's just you and me now.

36:09.584 --> 36:11.960
It's you and old Jack.
Come on.

36:12.044 --> 36:13.753
Come on. That's a boy!

36:13.796 --> 36:15.964
Good boy. Come get your bone!

36:16.048 --> 36:18.842
That's a good boy.
Come on, a bit closer, a bit closer.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.053
That's it! That's it, doggy!

36:22.096 --> 36:26.099
Come on, you filthy,
slimy, mangy cur!

36:26.767 --> 36:28.435
Don't do that. No, no, no!

36:28.477 --> 36:30.145
I didn't mean it! I didn't...

36:37.028 --> 36:38.570
This ain't the armoury!

36:40.281 --> 36:41.489
Well, well, well.

36:41.574 --> 36:44.451
Look what we have here, Twigg.

36:44.535 --> 36:46.620
Captain Jack Sparrow.

36:47.788 --> 36:49.956
Last time I saw you,

36:49.999 --> 36:51.791
you were all alone

36:51.876 --> 36:54.628
on a godforsaken island,

36:54.670 --> 36:56.880
shrinking into the distance.

36:56.964 --> 36:59.466
His fortunes aren't improved much.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.969
Worry about your own fortunes,
gentlemen.

37:03.012 --> 37:06.056
The deepest circle of hell
is reserved for betrayers

37:06.140 --> 37:07.682
and mutineers.

37:11.812 --> 37:13.313
So there is a curse.

37:15.024 --> 37:16.399
That's interesting.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.735
You know nothing of hell.

37:27.411 --> 37:29.412
That's very interesting.

38:04.865 --> 38:07.409
I didn't know we was takin' on captives.

38:07.493 --> 38:10.537
She's invoked the right of parley
with Captain Barbossa.

38:10.621 --> 38:14.457
- I am here to negotia...
- You will speak when spoken to!

38:15.459 --> 38:17.544
And ye will not lay a hand on those

38:17.586 --> 38:20.005
under the protection of parley.

38:20.631 --> 38:21.798
Aye, sir.

38:24.510 --> 38:26.428
My apologies, miss.

38:27.513 --> 38:28.847
Captain Barbossa,

38:28.889 --> 38:33.310
I am here to negotiate the cessation
of hostilities against Port Royal.

38:34.395 --> 38:38.440
A lot of long words in there, miss.
We are not but humble pirates.

38:39.525 --> 38:41.109
What is it that you want?

38:41.193 --> 38:43.320
I want you to leave and never come back.

38:45.948 --> 38:48.575
I'm disinclined
to acquiesce to your request.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.495
Means "no."

38:53.914 --> 38:54.914
Very well.

38:57.626 --> 38:59.586
I'll drop it.

39:03.549 --> 39:07.802
Me holds are burstin' with swag!
That bit of shine matters to us?

39:08.304 --> 39:09.304
Why?

39:10.431 --> 39:12.724
It's what you've been searching for.

39:12.767 --> 39:14.434
I recognise the ship.

39:14.518 --> 39:17.395
I saw it eight years ago
on the crossing from England!

39:17.438 --> 39:18.605
Did you now?

39:21.609 --> 39:22.609
Fine.

39:23.611 --> 39:25.195
I suppose if it is worthless,

39:25.279 --> 39:27.322
then there's no point in me keeping it.

39:27.406 --> 39:28.448
No!

39:39.377 --> 39:41.461
You have a name, missy?

39:42.588 --> 39:43.630
Elizabeth...

39:43.714 --> 39:45.048
...Turner.

39:46.175 --> 39:48.259
I'm a maid in the governor's household.

39:51.555 --> 39:52.972
Miss Turner!

39:54.183 --> 39:55.433
Turner!

39:55.476 --> 39:56.893
Bootstrap!

40:00.940 --> 40:03.608
And how does a maid come
to own a trinket such as that?

40:03.651 --> 40:06.277
Family heirloom, perhaps?

40:06.320 --> 40:08.822
I didn't steal it,
if that's what you mean.

40:10.408 --> 40:13.493
Very well. You hand it over,
we'll put your town to our rudder,

40:13.577 --> 40:14.786
and ne'er return.

40:28.509 --> 40:29.509
Our bargain?

40:32.513 --> 40:34.347
Still the guns and stow 'em.

40:34.390 --> 40:37.225
Signal the men, set the flags
and make good to clear port.

40:37.309 --> 40:39.018
Wait! You have to take me to shore.

40:39.061 --> 40:41.688
According to the code of
the order of the brethren...

40:41.772 --> 40:45.442
Your return to shore was not part of
our negotiation nor our agreements,

40:45.526 --> 40:46.693
so I must do nothin'.

40:46.777 --> 40:49.863
Secondly, you must be a pirate
for the pirate's code to apply,

40:49.905 --> 40:51.531
and you're not, and thirdly...

40:51.574 --> 40:54.325
...the code is more of what
you'd call a guideline,

40:54.368 --> 40:55.869
instead of actual rules.

40:55.911 --> 40:58.329
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,

40:58.372 --> 40:59.873
Miss Turner.

41:20.561 --> 41:22.979
They've taken her!
They've taken Elizabeth!

41:23.063 --> 41:25.148
Mr Murtogg, remove this man.

41:26.233 --> 41:28.318
We have to hunt them down!
We must save her!

41:28.402 --> 41:30.445
And where do you propose we start?

41:31.697 --> 41:35.366
If you have any information concerning
my daughter, please share it.

41:37.661 --> 41:39.412
That Jack Sparrow!

41:39.497 --> 41:41.748
He talked about the Black Pearl.

41:41.790 --> 41:43.708
Mentioned it is more what he did.

41:45.294 --> 41:48.421
Ask him where it is! Make a deal
with him, he could lead us to it.

41:48.464 --> 41:49.964
No.

41:50.049 --> 41:53.343
The pirates who invaded this fort
left Sparrow locked in his cell,

41:53.427 --> 41:56.429
ergo they are not his allies.

41:56.472 --> 41:59.474
Governor, we will establish
their most likely course...

41:59.558 --> 42:01.434
That's not good enough!

42:01.477 --> 42:03.436
Mr Turner...

42:03.479 --> 42:07.023
...you are not a military man,
you are not a sailor.

42:08.067 --> 42:09.442
You are a blacksmith.

42:09.485 --> 42:12.320
And this is not the moment
for rash actions!

42:14.615 --> 42:17.617
Do not make the mistake of thinking
you are the only man here

42:17.701 --> 42:19.202
who cares for Elizabeth.

42:25.209 --> 42:26.417
Please...

42:31.340 --> 42:32.549
You! Sparrow!

42:32.633 --> 42:33.633
Aye?

42:33.676 --> 42:36.302
You are familiar with that ship,
the Black Pearl?

42:36.345 --> 42:37.720
I've heard of it.

42:37.805 --> 42:40.473
Where does it make berth?

42:41.475 --> 42:43.434
Have you not heard the stories?

42:45.145 --> 42:47.105
Captain Barbossa

42:47.147 --> 42:48.898
and his crew of miscreants

42:48.983 --> 42:51.568
sail from the dreaded Isla de Muerte.

42:51.652 --> 42:54.445
It's an island that
cannot be found, except

42:54.488 --> 42:57.574
by those who already know where it is.

42:57.658 --> 42:59.325
The ship's real enough,

42:59.368 --> 43:02.829
therefore its anchorage must be
a real place. Where is it?

43:03.831 --> 43:04.998
Why ask me?

43:05.666 --> 43:07.250
Because you're a pirate.

43:07.334 --> 43:10.003
And you want to turn pirate yourself.
Is that it?

43:11.255 --> 43:12.255
Never!

43:16.010 --> 43:17.677
They took Miss Swann.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.554
So it is that you found a girl!

43:19.638 --> 43:21.431
I see.

43:21.515 --> 43:24.267
If you're intending to brave all,
hasten to her rescue,

43:24.351 --> 43:26.311
and so, win fair lady's heart...

43:26.353 --> 43:28.980
...you'll have to do it alone, mate.

43:29.023 --> 43:31.107
I see no profit in it for me.

43:32.192 --> 43:33.443
I can get you out of here.

43:33.527 --> 43:35.194
How's that? The key's run off.

43:35.237 --> 43:36.863
I helped build these cells.

43:36.947 --> 43:39.699
These are half-pin barrel hinges.

43:40.993 --> 43:44.287
With the right leverage,
and the proper application of strength,

43:45.414 --> 43:46.831
the door will lift free.

43:49.209 --> 43:50.460
What's your name?

43:50.544 --> 43:52.462
Will Turner.

43:53.756 --> 43:56.090
That would be short for William,
I imagine.

43:56.175 --> 43:57.342
Good, strong name.

43:58.344 --> 44:00.261
No doubt named for your father?

44:02.014 --> 44:03.014
Yes.

44:05.851 --> 44:07.185
Well, Mr Turner,

44:07.227 --> 44:08.436
I've changed me mind.

44:09.104 --> 44:12.106
If you spring me from this cell,
I swear, on pain of death,

44:12.191 --> 44:14.400
I shall take you to the Black Pearl,

44:14.443 --> 44:16.110
and your bonny lass.

44:16.195 --> 44:18.196
Do we have an accord?

44:21.700 --> 44:23.534
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

44:23.577 --> 44:24.744
Get me out.

44:28.248 --> 44:32.043
- Hurry! Someone will have heard that.
- Not without my effects.

44:38.634 --> 44:40.134
We're going to steal the ship?

44:41.929 --> 44:42.929
That ship?

44:43.013 --> 44:44.847
Commandeer.

44:44.932 --> 44:47.183
We're going to commandeer that ship.

44:47.267 --> 44:48.351
Nautical term.

44:49.019 --> 44:51.104
One question about your business, boy,

44:51.188 --> 44:52.605
or there's no use going.

44:52.690 --> 44:54.190
This girl...

44:54.274 --> 44:56.984
...how far are you willing to go
to save her?

44:57.069 --> 44:58.403
I'd die for her.

44:58.445 --> 44:59.654
Oh, good.

44:59.738 --> 45:01.739
No worries then.

45:20.759 --> 45:23.302
This is either madness or brilliance.

45:24.096 --> 45:27.724
It's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

45:57.379 --> 46:01.174
Everyone stay calm!
We're taking over the ship.

46:01.258 --> 46:02.967
Aye! Avast!

46:06.180 --> 46:08.514
This ship cannot be crewed by two men.

46:09.391 --> 46:11.184
You'll never make it out of the bay.

46:11.226 --> 46:12.852
Son...

46:13.896 --> 46:16.731
...I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

46:16.815 --> 46:18.357
Savvy?

46:21.862 --> 46:22.904
Commodore!

46:22.988 --> 46:25.198
Sir! They're taking the Dauntless!

46:27.201 --> 46:28.284
Commodore!

46:28.368 --> 46:30.703
They're taking the ship!

46:31.455 --> 46:34.081
Sparrow and Turner!
They're taking the Dauntless!

46:34.166 --> 46:35.500
Rash, Turner.

46:35.542 --> 46:37.210
Too rash.

46:38.754 --> 46:42.965
He is, without doubt,
the worst pirate I have ever seen.

46:46.261 --> 46:47.553
Here they come.

46:52.392 --> 46:54.644
Bring her around!
Bring her around!

47:01.193 --> 47:04.362
Search every cabin, every hold,
down to the bilges.

47:20.379 --> 47:23.256
Sailors, back to the Interceptor!
Now!

47:29.263 --> 47:33.182
Thank you, Commodore,
for getting us ready to make way.

47:33.267 --> 47:35.852
We'd have had a hard time
of it by ourselves.

47:39.106 --> 47:41.148
Set topsails and clear up this mess.

47:41.233 --> 47:43.776
With the wind a quarter astern,
we won't catch them!

47:43.861 --> 47:46.779
I don't need to. Just get them
in range of the long nines.

47:46.864 --> 47:48.948
Hands, come about! Run out the guns!

47:48.991 --> 47:50.366
Bring out the guns!

47:50.450 --> 47:53.035
We are to fire on our own ship, sir?

47:53.120 --> 47:56.956
I'd rather see her at the bottom of the
ocean than in the hands of a pirate.

47:58.250 --> 47:59.458
Commodore!

47:59.501 --> 48:01.586
He's disabled the rudder chain, sir.

48:05.299 --> 48:06.966
Abandon ship!

48:13.640 --> 48:16.100
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.

48:17.311 --> 48:19.937
So it would seem.

48:28.572 --> 48:30.448
When I was a lad, living in England,

48:30.490 --> 48:32.450
my mother raised me by herself.

48:32.534 --> 48:34.493
After she died, I came out here,

48:34.578 --> 48:36.412
looking for my father.

48:37.873 --> 48:38.998
Is that so?

48:40.208 --> 48:41.751
My father,

48:41.835 --> 48:43.210
Bill Turner?

48:43.295 --> 48:46.881
At the jail, it was only after you
learned my name that you agreed to help.

48:46.965 --> 48:49.675
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

48:49.718 --> 48:51.302
I'm not a simpleton, Jack.

48:51.345 --> 48:53.346
You knew my father.

48:59.519 --> 49:00.561
I knew him.

49:00.646 --> 49:03.564
Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

49:03.649 --> 49:07.068
Everyone else just called him
"Bootstrap," or "Bootstrap Bill."

49:07.152 --> 49:08.152
Bootstrap?

49:09.154 --> 49:11.572
Good man.
Good pirate.

49:11.657 --> 49:13.741
I swear, you look just like him.

49:13.825 --> 49:14.867
It's not true.

49:14.910 --> 49:16.702
He was a merchant sailor.

49:16.787 --> 49:19.038
A good, respectable man
who obeyed the law.

49:19.122 --> 49:21.290
He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.

49:22.668 --> 49:25.378
My father was not a pirate!

49:26.546 --> 49:28.547
Put it away, son.

49:28.632 --> 49:30.549
It's not worth you getting beat again.

49:30.634 --> 49:31.759
You didn't beat me.

49:31.843 --> 49:35.179
You ignored the rules of engagement.
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.

49:35.222 --> 49:38.057
That's not much incentive
for me to fight fair, is it?

49:45.399 --> 49:48.651
Now as long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

49:48.735 --> 49:51.237
The only rules
that really matter are these:

49:51.321 --> 49:55.199
What a man can do,
and what a man can't do.

49:55.909 --> 49:57.076
For instance,

49:57.160 --> 50:00.287
you can accept that your father
was a pirate and a good man,

50:00.372 --> 50:01.414
or you can't.

50:01.456 --> 50:05.001
Pirate is in your blood, boy, so
you'll have to square with that someday.

50:05.877 --> 50:08.045
Now, me, for example.
I could let you drown,

50:08.088 --> 50:12.591
but I can't bring this ship into Tortuga
all by me onesies. Savvy?

50:12.926 --> 50:13.926
So...

50:18.974 --> 50:22.309
Can you sail under
the command of a pirate?

50:23.562 --> 50:24.895
Or can you not?

50:27.607 --> 50:28.649
Tortuga?

50:28.734 --> 50:30.484
Tortuga.

50:52.549 --> 50:56.886
More importantly, it is indeed
a sad life that has never breathed deep

50:56.970 --> 51:00.139
the sweet, proliferous bouquet
that is Tortuga. Savvy?

51:01.892 --> 51:03.017
What do you think?

51:07.314 --> 51:08.397
It'll linger.

51:08.482 --> 51:12.485
I'll tell you, mate, if every town
in the world were like this one,

51:12.569 --> 51:15.029
no man would ever feel unwanted.

51:16.990 --> 51:18.074
Scarlett!

51:19.993 --> 51:21.327
Not sure I deserved that.

51:23.121 --> 51:24.288
Giselle!

51:24.331 --> 51:25.331
Who was she?

51:25.415 --> 51:26.415
What?

51:28.710 --> 51:30.002
I may have deserved that.

51:32.255 --> 51:35.382
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot!

51:37.719 --> 51:39.845
Mother's love!

51:39.930 --> 51:40.930
Jack!

51:41.932 --> 51:45.059
You should know better than to
wake a man when he's sleepin'.

51:45.143 --> 51:49.021
- It's bad luck.
- Fortunately, I know how to counter it.

51:49.106 --> 51:52.399
The man who did the waking buys
the man who was sleeping a drink,

51:52.484 --> 51:55.903
and the man who was sleeping drinks
while listening to a proposition

51:55.987 --> 51:57.696
from the man who did the waking.

51:59.866 --> 52:01.700
Aye, that'll about do it.

52:06.540 --> 52:08.791
Blast! I'm already awake!

52:08.875 --> 52:10.251
That was for the smell.

52:20.720 --> 52:22.221
Keep a sharp eye.

52:29.354 --> 52:30.437
Now...

52:30.522 --> 52:32.982
...what's the nature
of this venture of you'rn?

52:34.818 --> 52:36.902
I'm going after the Black Pearl.

52:40.740 --> 52:42.241
I know where it's going to be,

52:42.284 --> 52:44.076
and I'm gonna take it.

52:45.120 --> 52:46.120
Jack,

52:46.204 --> 52:48.497
it's a fool's errand!

52:48.582 --> 52:51.917
Well, you know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl!

52:51.960 --> 52:54.086
That's why I know
what Barbossa is up to.

52:55.088 --> 52:56.422
All I need is a crew.

52:57.132 --> 52:59.133
What I hear tell of Captain Barbossa,

52:59.217 --> 53:02.219
he's not a man to suffer fools,
nor strike a bargain with one!

53:02.262 --> 53:04.513
I'd say it's a good thing
I'm not a fool, then.

53:04.598 --> 53:05.681
Prove me wrong!

53:06.349 --> 53:09.685
What makes you think Barbossa
will give up his ship to you?

53:09.769 --> 53:13.105
Let's just say
it's a matter of leverage, eh?

53:29.331 --> 53:30.331
The kid?

53:31.917 --> 53:34.919
That is the child
of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

53:36.004 --> 53:38.464
His only child. Savvy?

53:38.548 --> 53:40.466
Is he now?

53:43.428 --> 53:45.804
Leverage, says you.

53:45.889 --> 53:48.849
I think I feel
a change in the wind, says I.

53:48.934 --> 53:50.309
I'll find us a crew.

53:50.352 --> 53:53.312
There's bound to be some sailors
on this rock, crazy as you.

53:53.355 --> 53:55.689
One can only hope.

53:55.774 --> 53:58.525
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!

54:23.385 --> 54:25.177
You'll be dining with the captain,

54:25.220 --> 54:27.596
and he requests you wear this.

54:28.556 --> 54:32.184
Tell the captain I'm "disinclined
to acquiesce to his request."

54:33.311 --> 54:35.562
He said you'd say that.

54:35.647 --> 54:38.023
He also said, if that be the case...

54:38.108 --> 54:39.858
...you'll be dining with the crew,

54:39.901 --> 54:41.443
and you'll be naked.

54:48.201 --> 54:49.285
Fine.

55:05.927 --> 55:09.513
There's no need to stand on ceremony
no call to impress anyone.

55:09.556 --> 55:11.932
You must be hungry.

55:29.367 --> 55:30.576
Try the wine.

55:35.415 --> 55:38.417
And the apples. One of those next.

55:46.718 --> 55:48.385
It's poisoned.

55:49.929 --> 55:52.264
There would be no sense
to be killing you.

55:52.307 --> 55:55.768
Then release me. You have your trinket.
I'm of no further value to you.

55:59.773 --> 56:01.815
You don't know what this is,

56:01.900 --> 56:03.275
do you?

56:03.360 --> 56:05.611
It's a pirate medallion.

56:05.653 --> 56:07.738
This is Aztec gold.

56:08.615 --> 56:11.408
One of 882 identical pieces

56:11.451 --> 56:15.037
they delivered in a stone chest
to CortÃ©s himself.

56:16.122 --> 56:20.334
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

56:20.418 --> 56:24.254
But the greed of CortÃ©s was insatiable.

56:24.297 --> 56:27.800
So the heathen gods
placed upon the gold...

56:29.677 --> 56:31.303
...a terrible curse.

56:32.931 --> 56:37.184
Any mortal that removes but
a single piece from that stone chest...

56:38.186 --> 56:40.646
...shall be punished for eternity.

56:42.982 --> 56:46.360
I hardly believe in ghost stories
any more, Captain Barbossa.

56:46.486 --> 56:47.653
Aye.

56:48.488 --> 56:51.990
That's exactly what I thought
when we were first told the tale.

56:52.033 --> 56:54.952
Buried on an Isle of the Dead
what cannot be found,

56:54.994 --> 56:56.870
except for those who know where it is.

56:58.581 --> 56:59.915
Find it, we did.

57:01.584 --> 57:02.918
There be the chest.

57:03.002 --> 57:04.795
Inside be the gold.

57:05.755 --> 57:08.173
And we took 'em all!

57:08.216 --> 57:10.217
We spent 'em and traded 'em,

57:10.301 --> 57:11.969
and frittered 'em away

57:12.011 --> 57:14.763
on drink and food
and pleasurable company.

57:14.848 --> 57:16.849
The more we gave 'em away,

57:16.891 --> 57:19.560
the more we came to realise...

57:20.854 --> 57:23.021
...the drink would not satisfy.

57:24.274 --> 57:27.025
Food turned to ash in our mouths...

57:27.694 --> 57:30.279
...and all the pleasurable company
in the world

57:30.363 --> 57:32.364
could not slake our lust.

57:34.242 --> 57:37.035
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

57:38.788 --> 57:41.457
Compelled by greed we were, but now...

57:42.459 --> 57:44.877
...we are consumed by it.

57:56.055 --> 57:58.974
There is one way we can end our curse.

58:03.062 --> 58:06.023
All the scattered pieces
of the Aztec gold

58:06.065 --> 58:07.483
must be restored,

58:07.567 --> 58:09.985
and the blood repaid.

58:12.739 --> 58:14.114
Thanks to ye,

58:14.199 --> 58:16.325
we have the final piece.

58:18.369 --> 58:20.662
And the... blood to be repaid?

58:20.747 --> 58:23.248
That's why there's no sense
to be killing ya.

58:24.042 --> 58:25.042
Yet.

58:27.086 --> 58:28.587
Apple?

58:37.138 --> 58:38.138
Let me go!

58:45.438 --> 58:46.438
I'm curious.

58:46.523 --> 58:49.441
After killing me, what is it
you're planning on doing next?

59:54.007 --> 59:55.215
Look!

59:55.300 --> 59:58.218
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

59:59.012 --> 01:00:02.264
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

01:00:02.348 --> 01:00:04.016
But neither are we dead.

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:09.062
For too long I've been parched of thirst
and unable to quench it.

01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:11.523
Too long I've been starvin' to death,

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:13.233
and haven't died!

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.652
I feel nothing.

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:19.364
Not the wind on my face,
nor the spray of the sea...

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:22.951
...nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:28.457
You best start believing
in ghost stories, Miss Turner.

01:00:28.541 --> 01:00:29.541
You're in one!

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:50.562
What are you looking at?
Back to work!

01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:01.448
Feast your eyes, captain.

01:01:01.532 --> 01:01:04.451
All of them,
faithful hands before the mast.

01:01:04.535 --> 01:01:07.746
Every man worth his salt...

01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:09.831
...and crazy to boot.

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:12.751
So this is your able-bodied crew?

01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:19.591
You, sailor!

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:21.051
Cotton, sir.

01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:22.886
Mr Cotton.

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:26.264
Do you have the courage and fortitude
to follow orders and stay true

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.933
in the face of danger and death?

01:01:27.975 --> 01:01:29.685
Mr Cotton!

01:01:29.769 --> 01:01:30.894
Answer, man!

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:32.354
He's a mute, sir.

01:01:32.438 --> 01:01:34.147
Poor devil had his tongue cut out.

01:01:34.232 --> 01:01:36.274
So he trained the parrot
to talk for him.

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:38.235
No one's yet figured how.

01:01:41.447 --> 01:01:43.073
Mr Cotton's parrot.

01:01:44.075 --> 01:01:45.575
Same question.

01:01:45.618 --> 01:01:48.370
When do you sail?
When do you sail?

01:01:49.497 --> 01:01:51.581
Mostly, we figure that means "yes."

01:01:51.624 --> 01:01:53.125
Of course it does.

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:54.209
Satisfied?

01:01:55.169 --> 01:01:57.254
Well, you've proved they're mad!

01:01:57.296 --> 01:01:59.131
And what's the benefit for us?

01:02:09.642 --> 01:02:10.726
Anamaria!

01:02:12.645 --> 01:02:14.980
I suppose you didn't deserve
that one, either.

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:16.982
No, that one I deserved.

01:02:17.024 --> 01:02:18.775
You stole my boat!

01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:19.901
Actually...

01:02:21.988 --> 01:02:24.364
Borrowed. Borrowed, without permission,

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:27.033
but with every intention
of bringing it back to you.

01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:28.535
But you didn't!

01:02:28.619 --> 01:02:29.995
You'll get another one!

01:02:31.372 --> 01:02:32.372
I will!

01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:33.457
A better one.

01:02:33.499 --> 01:02:34.958
A better one!

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:37.502
- That one!
- What one?

01:02:40.214 --> 01:02:41.381
That one?

01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:46.553
Aye. That one.

01:02:46.637 --> 01:02:48.221
- What say you?
- Aye!

01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:49.681
Aye!

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:50.766
Anchors away!

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:54.060
No, no, no, no, no!
It's frightful bad luck

01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:55.645
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

01:02:55.688 --> 01:02:58.356
It'll be far worse not to have her.

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:35.101
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find,

01:03:35.186 --> 01:03:37.646
with a compass that doesn't work?

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:39.689
Aye, the compass doesn't point north,

01:03:39.732 --> 01:03:42.567
but we're not trying
to find north, are we?

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:55.622
We should drop canvas, sir.

01:03:55.706 --> 01:03:57.749
She can hold a bit longer.

01:03:59.961 --> 01:04:03.505
What's in your head that's put you
in such a fine mood, captain?

01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:05.590
We're catching up.

01:04:20.606 --> 01:04:22.607
Time to go, poppet.

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:22.584
Dead men tell no tales...

01:05:25.129 --> 01:05:27.797
Puts a chill in the bones,
how many honest sailors

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.674
have been claimed by this passage.

01:05:45.149 --> 01:05:47.525
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

01:05:47.568 --> 01:05:50.779
Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow
'fore he showed up in Tortuga

01:05:50.863 --> 01:05:53.531
with a mind to go after
the treasure of Isla de Muerte.

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:54.866
That was before I met him,

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:57.118
back when he was captain
of the Black Pearl.

01:05:57.995 --> 01:05:58.995
What?

01:06:02.667 --> 01:06:04.125
He failed to mention that.

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:06.461
He plays things closer to the vest now.

01:06:06.545 --> 01:06:08.630
And a hard-learned lesson it was.

01:06:08.714 --> 01:06:11.591
Three days before the venture,
the first mate comes says,

01:06:11.676 --> 01:06:14.761
"Everything's an equal share.
That should mean the location

01:06:14.845 --> 01:06:18.223
of the treasure, too,"
so Jack gives up the bearings.

01:06:18.391 --> 01:06:20.558
That night, there was a mutiny.

01:06:21.602 --> 01:06:24.270
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die.

01:06:24.355 --> 01:06:27.023
But not before he'd
gone mad with the heat.

01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:33.530
So that's the reason for all the...

01:06:35.574 --> 01:06:37.283
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:40.412
Now, Will, when a pirate's marooned,

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:43.248
he's given a pistol with a single shot.
One shot...

01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:46.626
Well, that won't do much good hunting,
nor to be rescued.

01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:49.921
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

01:06:49.964 --> 01:06:53.341
that pistol starts to look
real friendly.

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.427
But Jack, he escaped the island,

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:57.095
and still has that single shot.

01:06:57.179 --> 01:06:59.764
He won't use it, though,
save on one man.

01:07:00.766 --> 01:07:02.809
His mutinous first mate.

01:07:02.893 --> 01:07:04.853
- Barbossa.
- Aye.

01:07:06.105 --> 01:07:09.065
- How did Jack get off the island?
- Well, I'll tell ye.

01:07:09.108 --> 01:07:11.234
He waded out into the shallows,

01:07:11.277 --> 01:07:13.862
and he waited there three days
and three nights,

01:07:13.946 --> 01:07:17.782
till all manner of sea creatures
came acclimated to his presence.

01:07:18.784 --> 01:07:20.326
And on the fourth morning,

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:24.539
he roped a couple of sea turtles,
lashed them together and made a raft.

01:07:26.792 --> 01:07:29.210
- He roped a couple of sea turtles.
- Aye.

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:30.587
Sea turtles!

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:34.841
What did he use for rope?

01:07:39.805 --> 01:07:41.389
Human hair.

01:07:42.391 --> 01:07:43.808
From my back.

01:07:44.977 --> 01:07:46.352
Let go the anchor!

01:07:46.437 --> 01:07:48.813
Lower the anchor line!

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:51.316
Young Mr Turner and I are to go ashore.

01:07:51.942 --> 01:07:53.068
Captain.

01:07:53.152 --> 01:07:54.861
What if the worst should happen?

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:58.239
- Keep to the code.
- Aye. The code.

01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:27.310
Ten years of hoarding swag!

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:29.854
And now we finally get to spend it!

01:08:37.196 --> 01:08:39.988
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men...

01:08:40.698 --> 01:08:44.410
...and you can buy an eye what
actually fits and is made of glass.

01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:47.412
This one does splinter
something terrible!

01:08:48.499 --> 01:08:49.707
Stop rubbing it!

01:09:09.353 --> 01:09:12.397
What code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:14.732
The pirates' code.

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:16.234
Any man who falls behind...

01:09:16.277 --> 01:09:18.611
...is left behind.

01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:22.240
No heroes amongst thieves.

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:26.035
You know, for having
such a bleak outlook on pirates,

01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:28.997
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

01:09:29.497 --> 01:09:31.082
Sprung a man from jail...

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:34.919
...commandeered a ship of the fleet,

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:37.505
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga...

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:42.926
...and you're completely
obsessed with treasure!

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.805
That's not true.

01:09:47.515 --> 01:09:49.267
I am not obsessed with treasure.

01:09:56.483 --> 01:09:59.235
Not all treasure
is silver and gold, mate.

01:09:59.278 --> 01:10:00.945
Gentlemen, the time has come!

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:02.614
Hurrah!

01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:04.824
Salvation is nigh!

01:10:04.909 --> 01:10:06.326
Yeah!

01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:09.120
- Our torment is nearing an end!
- Elizabeth.

01:10:10.331 --> 01:10:12.582
For ten years,
we've been tested and tried,

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:14.375
and each man-jack of you here

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:17.462
has proved his mettle 100 times over.

01:10:17.504 --> 01:10:19.797
And 100 times again!

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:20.840
Yeah!

01:10:21.967 --> 01:10:23.551
Suffered, I have!

01:10:24.303 --> 01:10:26.137
Punished, we were,

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:27.722
the lot of us,

01:10:27.806 --> 01:10:31.142
disproportionate to our crime!

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:33.019
Right!

01:10:33.103 --> 01:10:34.312
Here it is!

01:10:37.983 --> 01:10:41.611
The cursed treasure of CortÃ©s himself.

01:10:43.614 --> 01:10:46.157
Every last piece that went astray,

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.951
we have returned.

01:10:47.993 --> 01:10:49.702
Save for this!

01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:51.204
- Yeah!
- Jack!

01:10:51.288 --> 01:10:53.915
Not yet!

01:10:53.999 --> 01:10:56.501
We'll wait for the opportune moment.

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:59.337
...despairing
of ever finding the lass.

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:01.214
When's that?

01:11:01.298 --> 01:11:04.008
When it's of greatest profit to you?

01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:05.385
May I ask you something?

01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:09.097
Have I ever given you
reason not to trust me?

01:11:10.474 --> 01:11:11.474
Do us a favour.

01:11:11.517 --> 01:11:13.643
I know it's difficult for you,

01:11:13.686 --> 01:11:15.728
but please, stay here,

01:11:15.813 --> 01:11:18.690
and try not to do anything stupid.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:23.861
And who among us
has paid the blood sacrifice

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:26.197
- owed to the heathen gods?
- Aye!

01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:29.117
And whose blood must yet be paid?

01:11:29.201 --> 01:11:30.868
Hers!

01:11:33.038 --> 01:11:37.625
You know the first thing I'm going
to do after the curse is lifted?

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:43.298
Eat a whole bushel of apples!

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.141
Begun by blood,

01:11:53.225 --> 01:11:55.226
by blood undone.

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:00.732
Sorry, Jack.

01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:03.359
I'm not going to be your leverage.

01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:14.746
That's it?

01:12:14.788 --> 01:12:16.456
Waste not.

01:12:54.453 --> 01:12:55.787
Did it work?

01:12:55.829 --> 01:12:58.706
- I don't feel no different.
- How do we tell?

01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:07.298
You're not dead!

01:13:08.342 --> 01:13:09.967
No.

01:13:10.928 --> 01:13:12.261
He shot me!

01:13:12.304 --> 01:13:13.805
It didn't work!

01:13:13.889 --> 01:13:15.848
The curse is still upon us!

01:13:20.938 --> 01:13:23.398
You! Maid! Your father,
what was his name?

01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:25.733
Was your father William Turner?

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:27.318
No.

01:13:27.361 --> 01:13:30.863
Where's his child? The child that sailed
from England eight years ago?

01:13:30.948 --> 01:13:33.658
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner?

01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:34.700
Where?

01:13:41.708 --> 01:13:43.000
You two!

01:13:44.002 --> 01:13:46.087
- You brought us the wrong person!
- Yeah!

01:13:47.047 --> 01:13:48.047
No!

01:13:48.799 --> 01:13:51.592
She had the medallion!
She's the proper age!

01:13:51.677 --> 01:13:53.845
She said her name was Turner.
You heard her!

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:57.181
I think she lied to us!

01:13:57.224 --> 01:13:58.224
Yeah!

01:14:00.018 --> 01:14:02.353
You brought us here for nothing!

01:14:02.396 --> 01:14:06.524
I won't take questionin' or
second-guessin' from you, Mr Twigg!

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:07.859
Who's to blame him?

01:14:07.901 --> 01:14:10.862
Every decision you've made
has led us from bad to worse!

01:14:13.073 --> 01:14:15.658
It was you who sent
Bootstrap to the depths!

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:16.701
Yeah!

01:14:19.496 --> 01:14:22.081
And it's you who brought us
here in the first place!

01:14:23.876 --> 01:14:26.544
If any coward here dare challenge me,
let him speak!

01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:30.756
I say, we cut her throat,

01:14:30.841 --> 01:14:32.467
and spill all her blood!

01:14:32.551 --> 01:14:33.551
Just in case.

01:14:33.594 --> 01:14:34.594
Yeah!

01:14:43.687 --> 01:14:44.896
The medallion!

01:14:44.938 --> 01:14:46.272
She's taken it!

01:14:46.356 --> 01:14:50.818
Get after her,
you feckless pack of ingrates!

01:14:56.366 --> 01:14:59.368
- Where's the oars?
- There's no oars!

01:14:59.411 --> 01:15:02.246
The oars have gone missing!
Find them!

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.340
You!

01:15:14.426 --> 01:15:16.093
You're supposed to be dead!

01:15:16.136 --> 01:15:17.470
Am I not?

01:15:36.907 --> 01:15:39.659
...parsnip... pars-ley...

01:15:39.743 --> 01:15:41.744
...Partner, pardoner...

01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:42.787
Parley?

01:15:42.871 --> 01:15:44.705
That's the one! Parley!

01:15:45.457 --> 01:15:46.457
Parley!

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:47.792
Parley?!

01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:52.838
Damned to the depths whatever
madman thought of parley!

01:15:54.466 --> 01:15:56.759
That would be the French.

01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:09.772
Not more pirates!

01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:11.857
Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:14.026
Mr Gibbs?

01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:16.028
Hey boy, where be Jack?

01:16:17.155 --> 01:16:19.657
Jack? Jack Sparrow?

01:16:20.909 --> 01:16:22.410
He fell behind.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.502
Keep to the code!

01:16:32.754 --> 01:16:35.548
Weigh anchor!
Hoist the sails!

01:16:35.632 --> 01:16:37.300
Split-quick, you dibbies!

01:16:43.515 --> 01:16:46.559
How the blazes
did you get off that island?

01:16:47.978 --> 01:16:51.397
When you marooned me on
that godforsaken spit of land,

01:16:51.481 --> 01:16:53.858
you forgot one
very important thing, mate.

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.194
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

01:16:57.904 --> 01:17:01.532
Well, I won't be making that mistake...

01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:07.038
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow?

01:17:07.122 --> 01:17:08.122
Aye.

01:17:09.082 --> 01:17:10.124
Kill him.

01:17:11.585 --> 01:17:13.919
The girl's blood didn't work, did it?

01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:17.757
Hold your fire!

01:17:24.389 --> 01:17:26.932
You know whose blood we need?

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:30.519
I know whose blood you need.

01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:40.237
What sort of a man
trades a man's life for a ship?

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:41.572
A pirate.

01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:44.075
Here.

01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:45.868
Let me.

01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:47.411
Thank you.

01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:51.374
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours.

01:17:53.251 --> 01:17:54.251
Why?

01:17:57.589 --> 01:17:58.839
I don't know.

01:18:00.842 --> 01:18:03.052
I'm sorry. A blacksmith's hands.

01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:07.682
- I know they're rough.
- No... I mean, yes, they are, but...

01:18:10.143 --> 01:18:11.936
But don't stop.

01:18:20.445 --> 01:18:21.862
Elizabeth!

01:18:37.796 --> 01:18:39.130
It's yours.

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:46.971
I thought I'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

01:18:47.013 --> 01:18:48.472
It was a gift from my father.

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:50.641
He sent it to me.

01:18:56.314 --> 01:18:57.857
Why did you take it?

01:18:59.985 --> 01:19:02.737
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

01:19:04.322 --> 01:19:06.115
That would've been awful.

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:11.370
It wasn't your blood they needed.

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:16.417
It was my father's blood.

01:19:18.879 --> 01:19:21.464
My blood.

01:19:26.386 --> 01:19:27.762
The blood of a pirate.

01:19:27.846 --> 01:19:29.972
Will, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:46.947
So you expect to leave me standin' on
some beach, with nothing but a name

01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:52.369
and your word it's the one I need,
and watch you sail away in my ship?

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:53.621
No.

01:19:53.705 --> 01:19:57.833
I expect to leave you standing on some
beach with absolutely no name at all,

01:19:57.876 --> 01:19:59.960
watching me sail away on my ship,

01:20:00.045 --> 01:20:02.922
and then I'll shout
the name back to you.

01:20:03.006 --> 01:20:04.340
Savvy?

01:20:04.382 --> 01:20:07.426
That still leaves the problem
of me standing on some beach,

01:20:07.511 --> 01:20:11.347
with naught but a name and your word
it's the one I need.

01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:13.724
Of the two of us,

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:17.603
I am the only one who
hasn't committed mutiny.

01:20:17.687 --> 01:20:21.690
Therefore, my word is
the one we'll be trusting.

01:20:21.733 --> 01:20:23.317
Although...

01:20:23.401 --> 01:20:25.986
I suppose I should be thanking you
because, in fact,

01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:28.531
if you hadn't betrayed me
and left me to die,

01:20:29.574 --> 01:20:33.869
I would have an equal share
in that curse, same as you.

01:20:33.912 --> 01:20:35.329
Funny ol' world, isn't it?

01:20:39.251 --> 01:20:41.794
Captain! We're coming up
on the Interceptor.

01:20:54.933 --> 01:20:56.976
I'm having a thought here, Barbossa.

01:20:57.644 --> 01:20:59.436
What say we run up a flag of truce,

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:01.313
I scurry over to the Interceptor,

01:21:01.398 --> 01:21:04.859
and I negotiate the return of your
medallion. What say you to that?

01:21:05.819 --> 01:21:09.363
You see, Jack, that's exactly
the attitude that lost you the Pearl.

01:21:09.447 --> 01:21:12.324
People are easier to search
when they're dead.

01:21:13.368 --> 01:21:14.702
Lock him in the brig.

01:21:26.965 --> 01:21:29.425
Hands aloft to loose ta'gallants!

01:21:29.467 --> 01:21:32.803
With this wind dead astern,
she'll carry every sail we've got.

01:21:32.846 --> 01:21:34.972
- What's happening?
- The Black Pearl!

01:21:35.015 --> 01:21:36.515
She's gaining on us!

01:21:41.104 --> 01:21:43.480
This is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean!

01:21:43.565 --> 01:21:46.317
You can tell them that
after they've caught us!

01:21:46.359 --> 01:21:48.277
We're shallower on the draft, right?

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.320
Aye.

01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:51.488
Can't we lose them amongst those shoals?

01:21:52.949 --> 01:21:54.658
We don't have to outrun 'em long.

01:21:54.701 --> 01:21:55.993
Just long enough.

01:21:56.036 --> 01:21:57.328
Lighten the ship!

01:21:57.412 --> 01:21:58.579
Stem to stern!

01:21:58.663 --> 01:22:01.749
Anything we can afford to lose,
see that it's lost!

01:22:11.176 --> 01:22:13.177
Apparently, there's a leak.

01:22:27.859 --> 01:22:31.028
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!

01:22:31.071 --> 01:22:33.280
And run out the sweeps.

01:23:01.518 --> 01:23:02.768
We're gonna need that.

01:23:11.861 --> 01:23:14.655
It was a good plan, up till now.

01:23:14.739 --> 01:23:16.198
Gibbs!

01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:17.658
We have to make a stand.

01:23:17.742 --> 01:23:19.159
We must fight!

01:23:20.078 --> 01:23:22.204
- Load the guns!
- With what?

01:23:22.247 --> 01:23:23.998
Anything! Everything!

01:23:24.082 --> 01:23:25.791
Anything we have left!

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:29.795
Load the guns!

01:23:29.879 --> 01:23:31.588
Case shot and langrage!

01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:33.257
Nails and crushed glass!

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:36.969
With a will!

01:23:58.283 --> 01:24:01.118
The Pearl's gonna luff up
on our port quarter!

01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:03.787
She'll rake us without ever
presenting a target!

01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:05.914
Lower the anchor on the right side.

01:24:06.499 --> 01:24:07.916
On the starboard side!

01:24:09.002 --> 01:24:12.087
- It has the element of surprise.
- You're daft, lady!

01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:13.130
You both are!

01:24:13.214 --> 01:24:14.631
Daft like Jack!

01:24:15.341 --> 01:24:16.842
Lower the starboard anchor!

01:24:17.469 --> 01:24:21.013
Do it, you gobs, or it's you
we'll load into the cannons!

01:24:21.097 --> 01:24:22.639
Aye!

01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:40.741
Let go!

01:24:47.332 --> 01:24:48.999
They're club haulin'!

01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:51.835
Hard a port!
Rack the starboard oars!

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:53.670
Hard a port!

01:25:05.058 --> 01:25:06.308
Keep her steady, man.

01:25:13.358 --> 01:25:14.358
Now!

01:25:14.442 --> 01:25:16.735
Fire!

01:25:26.496 --> 01:25:28.497
Stop blowing holes in my ship!

01:26:15.086 --> 01:26:17.254
We could use a few more ideas, lass!

01:26:17.338 --> 01:26:18.922
It's your turn!

01:26:18.965 --> 01:26:20.757
We need us a devil's dowry!

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:22.134
We'll give them her!

01:26:23.136 --> 01:26:24.636
She's not what they're after.

01:26:27.223 --> 01:26:28.557
The medallion!

01:26:49.913 --> 01:26:53.248
Strike your colours,
you bloomin' cockroaches!

01:26:53.291 --> 01:26:56.043
Hands, grapnels, at the ready!

01:26:56.127 --> 01:26:57.961
Prepare to board!

01:27:32.288 --> 01:27:35.123
Pistols and cutlasses, men!

01:27:35.166 --> 01:27:37.459
Koehler and Twigg
to the powder magazine!

01:27:37.502 --> 01:27:40.837
And the rest of you,
bring me the medallion!

01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:52.808
Hey! Hey!

01:28:08.616 --> 01:28:11.285
Hey! Below!

01:28:31.055 --> 01:28:32.556
Thanks very much.

01:28:45.945 --> 01:28:46.945
Jack!

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:50.115
Bloody empty!

01:29:06.049 --> 01:29:07.924
That's not very nice.

01:29:12.555 --> 01:29:13.764
Where is the medallion?

01:29:13.806 --> 01:29:14.890
Wretch!

01:29:17.935 --> 01:29:19.269
Where is dear William?

01:29:21.481 --> 01:29:22.731
Will!

01:29:24.942 --> 01:29:27.152
- Will!
- Elizabeth!

01:29:30.114 --> 01:29:31.239
Monkey!

01:29:37.914 --> 01:29:39.748
I can't move it!

01:29:41.125 --> 01:29:42.125
Will!

01:29:42.168 --> 01:29:43.293
Elizabeth!

01:29:43.336 --> 01:29:44.419
Will!

01:29:55.515 --> 01:29:57.682
Why, thank you, Jack.

01:29:57.767 --> 01:29:59.393
You're welcome.

01:29:59.477 --> 01:30:02.020
Not you. We named the monkey Jack.

01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:06.149
Gents! Our hope is restored!

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:07.651
Yeah!

01:30:42.186 --> 01:30:46.189
Any of you so much
as thinks the word parley,

01:30:46.274 --> 01:30:49.025
I'll have your guts for garters!

01:30:56.909 --> 01:30:58.326
Will!

01:30:58.369 --> 01:31:00.370
Stop it! Stop it!

01:31:01.247 --> 01:31:03.206
Welcome back, miss.

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:06.042
You took advantage of
our hospitality last time.

01:31:06.085 --> 01:31:09.421
It holds fair now
that you return the favour!

01:31:15.386 --> 01:31:16.470
Barbossa!

01:31:18.431 --> 01:31:19.431
Will.

01:31:22.226 --> 01:31:23.226
She goes free!

01:31:24.353 --> 01:31:26.062
What's in your head, boy?

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:28.732
She goes free.

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:32.444
You've only got one shot,
and we can't die.

01:31:32.528 --> 01:31:34.529
Don't do anything stupid!

01:31:37.492 --> 01:31:38.742
You can't.

01:31:38.826 --> 01:31:40.243
I can.

01:31:41.954 --> 01:31:43.580
Like that.

01:31:44.624 --> 01:31:45.916
Who are you?

01:31:45.958 --> 01:31:47.459
No one! He's no one!

01:31:48.211 --> 01:31:51.421
A distant cousin of my aunt's
nephew, twice removed.

01:31:51.464 --> 01:31:53.757
Lovely singing voice, though. Eunuch!

01:31:53.799 --> 01:31:55.467
My name is Will Turner!

01:31:55.551 --> 01:31:58.261
My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.

01:31:58.304 --> 01:32:00.263
His blood runs in my veins.

01:32:00.973 --> 01:32:03.266
It's the spitting image
of ol' Bootstrap Bill,

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:05.143
come back to haunt us!

01:32:05.228 --> 01:32:07.229
On my word, do as I say,

01:32:07.271 --> 01:32:09.147
or I'll pull this trigger,

01:32:09.232 --> 01:32:11.441
and be lost to Davy Jones' locker!

01:32:12.485 --> 01:32:14.778
Name your terms, Mr Turner.

01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:15.987
Elizabeth goes free!

01:32:16.072 --> 01:32:17.697
Yes, we know that one.

01:32:17.782 --> 01:32:18.782
Anything else?

01:32:21.452 --> 01:32:22.744
And the crew!

01:32:22.787 --> 01:32:24.746
The crew are not to be harmed!

01:32:29.502 --> 01:32:31.294
Agreed.

01:32:50.481 --> 01:32:52.148
Barbossa, you lying bastard!

01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:54.818
You swore she'd go free!

01:32:54.902 --> 01:32:57.153
Don't dare impugn me honour, boy!

01:32:57.238 --> 01:32:58.905
I agreed she'd go free.

01:32:58.990 --> 01:33:02.033
It was you who failed to specify
when or where.

01:33:07.707 --> 01:33:11.668
Though it does seem a shame to lose
something so fine, don't it, lads?

01:33:11.711 --> 01:33:12.711
Aye.

01:33:13.713 --> 01:33:16.881
So I'll be havin' that dress
back before you go.

01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:22.721
I always liked you.

01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:28.685
Goes with your black heart!

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:31.438
It's still warm.

01:33:34.817 --> 01:33:36.860
Off you go!

01:33:36.944 --> 01:33:38.278
Come on!

01:33:41.907 --> 01:33:43.074
Too long!

01:33:54.211 --> 01:33:56.713
I really rather hoped
we were past all this.

01:33:58.299 --> 01:33:59.716
Jack.

01:33:59.759 --> 01:34:00.842
Jack!

01:34:02.595 --> 01:34:04.054
Did ya not notice?

01:34:04.138 --> 01:34:08.391
That be the same island we made you
governor of on our last little trip.

01:34:09.685 --> 01:34:11.353
I did notice.

01:34:11.395 --> 01:34:15.565
Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up
another miraculous escape,

01:34:15.608 --> 01:34:17.233
but I doubt it.

01:34:20.071 --> 01:34:21.613
Off you go.

01:34:22.615 --> 01:34:25.241
Last time you left me
a pistol with one shot.

01:34:25.326 --> 01:34:26.910
By the powers, you're right!

01:34:26.994 --> 01:34:29.120
Where be Jack's pistol?

01:34:29.205 --> 01:34:30.372
Bring it forward.

01:34:33.542 --> 01:34:36.336
Seeing as there's two of us,
a gentleman...

01:34:37.046 --> 01:34:38.838
...would give us a pair of pistols.

01:34:38.923 --> 01:34:40.632
It'll be one pistol, as before,

01:34:40.716 --> 01:34:43.510
and you can be the gentleman
and shoot the lady,

01:34:43.594 --> 01:34:45.428
and starve to death yourself!

01:35:09.787 --> 01:35:13.331
That's the second time I've had to watch
that man sail away with my ship.

01:35:15.793 --> 01:35:18.461
You were marooned on this island
before, weren't you?

01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:20.130
We can escape the same way!

01:35:20.172 --> 01:35:22.298
To what point and purpose, young missy?

01:35:23.050 --> 01:35:24.801
The Black Pearl is gone,

01:35:24.844 --> 01:35:28.304
and unless you have a rudder and
a lot of sails hidden in that bodice...

01:35:28.389 --> 01:35:30.807
Unlikely...

01:35:30.850 --> 01:35:33.810
Young Mr Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:38.815
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow!

01:35:38.858 --> 01:35:43.278
You vanished from under the eyes of
seven agents of the East India Company!

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:46.072
You sacked Nassau Port
without even firing a shot!

01:35:46.157 --> 01:35:48.408
Are you the pirate
I've read about or not?

01:35:50.953 --> 01:35:52.454
How did you escape last time?

01:35:59.295 --> 01:36:01.171
Last time...

01:36:01.213 --> 01:36:04.007
...I was here a grand total
of three days, all right?

01:36:05.009 --> 01:36:06.009
Last time...

01:36:08.053 --> 01:36:11.347
...the rum runners used this island
as a cache.

01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:13.850
They came by and I was able
to barter passage off.

01:36:13.934 --> 01:36:15.685
From the looks of things,

01:36:15.770 --> 01:36:17.979
they've long been out of business.

01:36:18.022 --> 01:36:23.151
You probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

01:36:23.194 --> 01:36:24.736
So that's it then?

01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:29.866
That's the secret, grand adventure
of the infamous Jack Sparrow!

01:36:30.868 --> 01:36:32.660
You spent three days,

01:36:32.703 --> 01:36:35.038
lying on a beach, drinking rum.

01:36:37.416 --> 01:36:41.211
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

01:36:49.261 --> 01:36:52.514
We're devils, we're black sheep
We're really bad eggs

01:36:52.556 --> 01:36:54.724
Drink up, me hearties
Yo ho

01:36:54.809 --> 01:36:59.354
Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me

01:36:59.396 --> 01:37:01.272
I love this song!

01:37:04.235 --> 01:37:06.402
Really bad eggs!

01:37:11.283 --> 01:37:13.284
When I get the Pearl back,

01:37:13.369 --> 01:37:15.870
I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew,

01:37:15.913 --> 01:37:17.455
and we'll sing it all the time!

01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:21.334
And you will be positively the most
fearsome pirates in the Spanish Main!

01:37:21.418 --> 01:37:23.253
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

01:37:24.296 --> 01:37:26.005
The entire ocean!

01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:27.841
The entire world!

01:37:27.925 --> 01:37:30.760
Wherever we want to go, we go.

01:37:30.803 --> 01:37:32.387
That's what a ship is, you know.

01:37:32.429 --> 01:37:35.265
It's not just a keel and a hull
and a deck and sails.

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:36.850
That's what a ship needs.

01:37:36.934 --> 01:37:38.935
But what a ship is...

01:37:40.312 --> 01:37:43.273
What the Black Pearl really is...

01:37:44.733 --> 01:37:47.986
...is freedom.

01:37:48.988 --> 01:37:50.071
Jack...

01:37:50.114 --> 01:37:54.868
It must be really terrible for you
to be trapped on this island.

01:37:55.661 --> 01:37:56.870
Oh, yes.

01:37:56.954 --> 01:37:59.789
But the company is...

01:37:59.832 --> 01:38:02.625
...infinitely better than last time,
and the...

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:08.131
- ...scenery has definitely improved.
- Mr Sparrow!

01:38:08.173 --> 01:38:12.218
I'm not entirely sure I've had
enough rum to allow that kind of talk.

01:38:13.846 --> 01:38:15.638
I know exactly what you mean, love.

01:38:23.147 --> 01:38:24.689
To freedom!

01:38:27.443 --> 01:38:28.985
To the Black Pearl.

01:38:58.515 --> 01:38:59.599
No!

01:38:59.683 --> 01:39:02.477
Not good! Stop!

01:39:02.519 --> 01:39:03.728
Not good!

01:39:03.812 --> 01:39:04.812
What are you doing?

01:39:04.855 --> 01:39:06.940
You've burned all the food, the shade...

01:39:07.024 --> 01:39:09.275
- ...the rum!
- Yes, the rum is gone.

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.610
Why is the rum gone?

01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:12.946
One, because it is a vile drink

01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:15.949
that turns even the most respectable
men into scoundrels.

01:39:16.033 --> 01:39:19.118
Two, that signal
is over 1,000 feet high.

01:39:19.203 --> 01:39:21.412
The entire Royal Navy
is out looking for me.

01:39:21.497 --> 01:39:23.873
Do you think there is even
the slightest chance

01:39:23.916 --> 01:39:25.083
they won't see it?

01:39:25.167 --> 01:39:27.001
But why is the rum gone?

01:39:28.087 --> 01:39:29.545
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.

01:39:29.588 --> 01:39:31.381
You give it one hour, maybe two,

01:39:31.465 --> 01:39:36.386
keep a weather eye open, and you
will see white sails on that horizon.

01:39:41.892 --> 01:39:44.894
"Must've been terrible for you
to be trapped here, Jack."

01:39:44.937 --> 01:39:48.022
"Must've been terrible for you..."
Well, it bloody is now!

01:39:55.406 --> 01:39:58.741
There'll be no
living with her after this.

01:39:58.826 --> 01:40:00.743
- But we've got to save Will!
- No!

01:40:00.786 --> 01:40:02.245
You're safe now.

01:40:02.329 --> 01:40:04.414
We will return to
Port Royal immediately,

01:40:04.498 --> 01:40:06.457
not go gallivanting after pirates!

01:40:06.542 --> 01:40:08.459
Then we condemn him to death!

01:40:09.545 --> 01:40:12.255
The boy's fate is regrettable...

01:40:12.339 --> 01:40:14.924
...but then, so was his decision
to engage in piracy.

01:40:15.009 --> 01:40:18.261
To rescue me! To prevent anything
from happening to me!

01:40:18.345 --> 01:40:22.181
If I may be so bold as to interject
my professional opinion,

01:40:22.266 --> 01:40:25.435
the Pearl was listing
near to scuppers after the battle.

01:40:25.477 --> 01:40:28.396
It's very unlikely she'd be able
to make good time.

01:40:28.439 --> 01:40:29.772
Think about it.

01:40:29.857 --> 01:40:32.066
The Black Pearl.

01:40:32.109 --> 01:40:35.653
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

01:40:36.655 --> 01:40:38.614
How can you pass that up?

01:40:40.784 --> 01:40:43.619
By remembering that I serve others,
Mr Sparrow,

01:40:43.662 --> 01:40:46.164
- not only myself.
- Commodore, I beg you!

01:40:46.248 --> 01:40:47.248
Please do this!

01:40:47.291 --> 01:40:48.916
For me!

01:40:48.959 --> 01:40:51.127
As a wedding gift.

01:40:51.211 --> 01:40:52.378
Elizabeth?

01:40:53.464 --> 01:40:56.007
Are you accepting
the commodore's proposal?

01:40:58.427 --> 01:40:59.469
I am.

01:41:00.304 --> 01:41:01.971
A wedding! I love weddings!

01:41:02.056 --> 01:41:03.806
Drinks all around!

01:41:06.101 --> 01:41:08.853
I know. "Clap him in irons," right?

01:41:11.398 --> 01:41:12.565
Mr Sparrow...

01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:16.235
...you will accompany
these fine men to the helm

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:18.821
and provide us with a bearing
to Isla de Muerta.

01:41:18.864 --> 01:41:22.784
You'll then spend the rest of the voyage
contemplating all possible meanings

01:41:22.826 --> 01:41:25.328
of the phrase "silent as the grave."

01:41:25.370 --> 01:41:26.954
Do I make myself clear?

01:41:26.997 --> 01:41:29.082
Inescapably clear.

01:41:33.879 --> 01:41:35.338
Shiver me timbers!

01:41:36.131 --> 01:41:37.757
Cotton says you missed a bit.

01:41:42.763 --> 01:41:44.138
You knew William Turner?

01:41:46.016 --> 01:41:48.101
Old Bootstrap Bill.

01:41:48.185 --> 01:41:49.185
We knew him.

01:41:50.187 --> 01:41:54.190
Never sat well with Bootstrap,
what we did to Jack Sparrow,

01:41:54.233 --> 01:41:56.317
the mutiny and all.

01:41:56.902 --> 01:41:58.903
He said it wasn't right with the code.

01:41:59.988 --> 01:42:03.157
That's why he sent off a piece of
the treasure to you, as it were.

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:06.828
He said we deserved to be cursed...

01:42:08.413 --> 01:42:10.498
...and remain cursed.

01:42:10.541 --> 01:42:11.582
Stupid blighter!

01:42:11.667 --> 01:42:13.501
Good man.

01:42:13.544 --> 01:42:15.378
But, as you can imagine,

01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:18.798
that didn't sit too well
with the captain.

01:42:18.882 --> 01:42:22.135
That didn't sit too well
with the captain at all!

01:42:22.219 --> 01:42:25.847
- Tell him what Barbossa did.
- I'm telling the story!

01:42:28.392 --> 01:42:32.478
So... what the captain did...

01:42:32.563 --> 01:42:35.148
...he strapped a cannon
to Bootstrap's bootstraps.

01:42:35.232 --> 01:42:36.732
Bootstrap's bootstraps!

01:42:36.775 --> 01:42:39.777
Last we saw of ol' Bill Turner...

01:42:39.862 --> 01:42:42.321
...he was sinking to
the crushin' black oblivion

01:42:42.406 --> 01:42:45.533
of Davy Jones' locker!

01:42:45.951 --> 01:42:49.036
'Course it was only after that
we learned we needed his blood

01:42:49.079 --> 01:42:50.288
to lift the curse.

01:42:50.372 --> 01:42:53.416
That's what you'd call ironic.

01:42:57.588 --> 01:42:59.213
Bring him!

01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:08.431
I don't care for the situation.

01:43:08.974 --> 01:43:12.059
Any attempt to stall in the caves
could turn into an ambush.

01:43:12.102 --> 01:43:15.438
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

01:43:15.522 --> 01:43:19.192
I go in and convince Barbossa to send
his men out in their little boats.

01:43:19.276 --> 01:43:22.111
You and your men return to the Dauntless

01:43:22.154 --> 01:43:25.406
and blast the bejesus out of them
with your little cannons.

01:43:25.449 --> 01:43:26.699
What do you have to lose?

01:43:27.784 --> 01:43:30.286
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

01:43:31.955 --> 01:43:33.831
Now, to be quite honest with you,

01:43:33.916 --> 01:43:36.876
there's still a slight risk
to those aboard the Dauntless,

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:40.755
which includes
the future Mrs Commodore.

01:43:40.797 --> 01:43:43.883
- It's for your safety!
- Don't care what the Commodore ordered!

01:43:43.967 --> 01:43:44.967
I have to tell him!

01:43:45.010 --> 01:43:48.012
The pirates! They're cursed!
They can't be killed!

01:43:48.096 --> 01:43:50.640
Don't worry, miss.
He's already informed of that.

01:43:50.682 --> 01:43:54.393
A little mermaid flopped up on deck
and told him the whole story!

01:43:54.478 --> 01:43:56.562
This is Jack Sparrow's doing!

01:44:08.033 --> 01:44:09.492
No reason to fret.

01:44:09.576 --> 01:44:12.161
Just a prick of the finger,
a few drops of blood...

01:44:12.204 --> 01:44:14.205
No mistakes this time.

01:44:14.289 --> 01:44:15.998
He's only half Turner.

01:44:16.083 --> 01:44:17.500
We spill it all!

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.754
Guess there is reason to fret.

01:44:35.686 --> 01:44:37.853
Beg your pardon, mate.
Beg your pardon.

01:44:37.938 --> 01:44:39.689
- Begun by blood...
- Excuse me.

01:44:39.773 --> 01:44:42.483
By blood un...

01:44:44.861 --> 01:44:45.861
Jack!

01:44:46.905 --> 01:44:47.989
It's not possible!

01:44:48.031 --> 01:44:50.199
Not probable.

01:44:50.242 --> 01:44:52.034
Where's Elizabeth?

01:44:53.412 --> 01:44:55.663
She's safe, just like I promised.

01:44:55.706 --> 01:44:58.666
She's all set to marry Norrington,
just like she promised,

01:44:58.709 --> 01:45:01.085
and you get to die for her,
just like you promised.

01:45:01.169 --> 01:45:03.296
So we're all men of our word, really.

01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:06.674
Except for Elizabeth,
who is, in fact, a woman.

01:45:06.717 --> 01:45:08.134
Shut up! You're next!

01:45:11.722 --> 01:45:14.557
You don't want to be doing that, mate.

01:45:14.599 --> 01:45:16.559
No, I really think I do.

01:45:18.353 --> 01:45:20.229
Your funeral.

01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:25.401
And why don't I want to be doing it?

01:45:25.444 --> 01:45:27.111
Oh, because...

01:45:28.113 --> 01:45:30.448
Because the HMS Dauntless,

01:45:30.532 --> 01:45:32.950
the pride of the Royal Navy,

01:45:33.035 --> 01:45:36.287
is floating just off shore,

01:45:36.371 --> 01:45:38.080
waiting for you.

01:45:46.256 --> 01:45:47.423
What we doing here?

01:45:49.343 --> 01:45:52.762
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

01:45:52.804 --> 01:45:54.889
We catch 'em in a crossfire,

01:45:54.931 --> 01:45:57.767
and send 'em down to see Old Hob.

01:45:59.061 --> 01:46:01.437
I know why we're here. I meant...

01:46:01.521 --> 01:46:03.397
...why aren't we doing what it was...

01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:05.274
What Mr Sparrow said we should do?

01:46:05.317 --> 01:46:06.817
With the cannons and all?

01:46:06.902 --> 01:46:09.945
Because it was Mr Sparrow who said it.

01:46:12.574 --> 01:46:15.159
You think he wasn't telling the truth?

01:46:15.243 --> 01:46:17.119
Just hear me out, mate.

01:46:17.204 --> 01:46:20.956
You order your men to row out to the
Dauntless, they do what they do best...

01:46:22.042 --> 01:46:26.462
Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your aunt.
There you are with two ships.

01:46:26.546 --> 01:46:28.964
The makings of your very own fleet.

01:46:29.049 --> 01:46:32.635
'Course, you'll take the grandest
as your flagship, and who's to argue?

01:46:32.719 --> 01:46:34.136
But what of the Pearl?

01:46:35.764 --> 01:46:37.098
Name me captain.

01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:40.601
I'll sail under your colours,
I'll give you ten percent of me plunder,

01:46:40.644 --> 01:46:42.853
and you'll get to
introduce yourself as...

01:46:43.438 --> 01:46:46.315
...Commodore Barbossa.

01:46:46.358 --> 01:46:47.441
Savvy?

01:46:47.484 --> 01:46:49.693
I suppose, in exchange, you'll be

01:46:49.778 --> 01:46:52.613
- wanting me not to kill the whelp.
- No. Not at all!

01:46:52.656 --> 01:46:54.323
By all means, kill the whelp!

01:46:54.366 --> 01:46:56.784
Just not yet.

01:46:56.827 --> 01:46:58.994
Wait to lift the curse

01:46:59.037 --> 01:47:01.705
until the opportune moment.

01:47:05.168 --> 01:47:06.794
For instance...

01:47:08.672 --> 01:47:11.924
...after you've killed Norrington's men.

01:47:12.008 --> 01:47:13.592
Every...

01:47:13.677 --> 01:47:15.344
...last...

01:47:15.387 --> 01:47:16.846
...one.

01:47:26.481 --> 01:47:28.816
You've been planning this
from the beginning!

01:47:28.859 --> 01:47:30.443
Ever since you learned my name!

01:47:31.278 --> 01:47:32.278
Yeah.

01:47:34.614 --> 01:47:36.740
I want 50 percent of your plunder.

01:47:36.825 --> 01:47:37.825
- 15!
- 40!

01:47:37.868 --> 01:47:38.868
25!

01:47:40.036 --> 01:47:41.370
And I'll buy you the hat.

01:47:41.413 --> 01:47:43.414
A really big one.

01:47:44.207 --> 01:47:45.374
Commodore.

01:47:48.503 --> 01:47:49.712
We have an accord.

01:47:51.381 --> 01:47:53.674
All hands to the boats!

01:47:54.676 --> 01:47:55.801
Apologies.

01:47:55.886 --> 01:47:57.553
You give the orders.

01:47:58.889 --> 01:47:59.889
Gents...

01:48:00.891 --> 01:48:02.266
...take a walk!

01:48:07.105 --> 01:48:08.439
Not to the boats?

01:49:07.832 --> 01:49:10.751
Hold fire!

01:49:12.796 --> 01:49:15.589
This is just like what
the Greeks done at Troy!

01:49:16.967 --> 01:49:18.592
'Cept they was in a horse,

01:49:18.635 --> 01:49:20.094
instead of dresses.

01:49:20.804 --> 01:49:22.179
Wooden horse.

01:49:35.151 --> 01:49:36.151
A moment, please.

01:49:40.323 --> 01:49:41.323
Elizabeth?

01:49:44.578 --> 01:49:46.370
I just want you to know, I...

01:49:47.497 --> 01:49:49.957
I believe you made a very
good decision today.

01:49:50.792 --> 01:49:52.793
Couldn't be more proud of you!

01:49:53.295 --> 01:49:54.420
But, you know,

01:49:54.504 --> 01:49:57.423
even a good decision,
if made for the wrong reasons,

01:49:57.507 --> 01:49:59.008
can be a wrong decision.

01:50:08.018 --> 01:50:09.018
Lieutenant.

01:50:28.204 --> 01:50:29.371
Elizabeth?

01:50:31.541 --> 01:50:32.791
Are you there?

01:50:35.045 --> 01:50:37.671
Elizabeth, are you even listening to me?

01:51:04.783 --> 01:51:06.867
What have you done?

01:51:07.827 --> 01:51:10.496
Stop that!
I already feel like a fool!

01:51:11.539 --> 01:51:12.915
Look nice, though.

01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:19.838
Do I look nice now?!

01:51:55.792 --> 01:51:57.042
I must admit, Jack.

01:51:57.127 --> 01:51:59.044
I thought I had you figured.

01:51:59.129 --> 01:52:02.297
But it turns out you're
a hard man to predict.

01:52:02.382 --> 01:52:04.341
Me, I'm dishonest.

01:52:04.426 --> 01:52:07.261
And a dishonest man you can
always trust to be dishonest.

01:52:07.303 --> 01:52:08.554
Honestly...

01:52:08.638 --> 01:52:11.265
...it's the honest ones
you want to watch out for.

01:52:11.307 --> 01:52:13.600
'Cause you can never predict

01:52:13.643 --> 01:52:16.937
when they're going to do
something incredibly...

01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:17.980
...stupid.

01:52:51.306 --> 01:52:53.348
You're off the edge of the map, mate.

01:52:53.433 --> 01:52:55.476
Here, there be monsters!

01:53:00.356 --> 01:53:01.690
Right.

01:53:03.359 --> 01:53:05.444
What would you pick to eat first?

01:53:05.528 --> 01:53:07.446
I think we should decide now,

01:53:07.530 --> 01:53:09.698
just so we're ready when the time comes!

01:53:34.766 --> 01:53:35.891
What was that?

01:53:58.832 --> 01:53:59.832
It's Elizabeth!

01:54:20.436 --> 01:54:22.104
Make for the ship! Move!

01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:17.451
You can't beat me, Jack.

01:55:41.851 --> 01:55:43.268
That's interesting!

01:55:54.155 --> 01:55:56.073
I couldn't resist, mate.

01:57:02.432 --> 01:57:03.640
Sorry!

01:57:12.734 --> 01:57:14.401
So, what now, Jack Sparrow?

01:57:14.444 --> 01:57:17.195
Are we to be two immortals,
locked in an empty battle

01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:19.990
until Judgment Day,
when the trumpets sound?

01:57:20.658 --> 01:57:22.075
Or you could surrender.

01:57:49.395 --> 01:57:50.604
All of you with me!

01:57:50.646 --> 01:57:52.731
Will is in that cave,
and we must save him!

01:57:52.815 --> 01:57:55.400
Ready, and... heave!

01:58:01.991 --> 01:58:04.034
Please, I need your help! Come on!

01:58:04.994 --> 01:58:06.828
Any port in a storm.

01:58:06.913 --> 01:58:08.997
Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl!

01:58:09.082 --> 01:58:11.333
What about Jack?
Are you just gonna leave him?

01:58:11.417 --> 01:58:13.210
Jack owes us a ship!

01:58:13.294 --> 01:58:14.836
There's the code to consider.

01:58:15.421 --> 01:58:16.546
The code?

01:58:18.299 --> 01:58:20.759
You're pirates!
Hang the code

01:58:20.843 --> 01:58:22.511
and hang the rules!

01:58:22.553 --> 01:58:24.971
They're more like guidelines, anyway.

01:58:28.768 --> 01:58:30.936
Bloody pirates!

01:58:42.365 --> 01:58:44.533
Is it supposed to be doing that?

01:58:44.617 --> 01:58:46.827
They're stealing our ship!

01:58:47.286 --> 01:58:48.954
Bloody pirates!

01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:52.874
Boarders away!

01:59:01.092 --> 01:59:03.093
Come on!

01:59:28.995 --> 01:59:30.328
Me eye!

01:59:50.266 --> 01:59:52.350
I'm gonna teach you the meaning of pain!

01:59:52.435 --> 01:59:54.019
You like pain?

01:59:55.813 --> 01:59:57.189
Try wearing a corset.

02:00:07.575 --> 02:00:09.201
Whose side is Jack on?

02:00:09.285 --> 02:00:12.329
You mean at the moment?

02:00:47.281 --> 02:00:48.406
No fair!

02:01:12.431 --> 02:01:14.266
Ten years you carry that pistol,

02:01:14.350 --> 02:01:16.685
and now you waste your shot!

02:01:17.687 --> 02:01:20.647
He didn't waste it.

02:01:45.298 --> 02:01:46.798
I feel...

02:01:51.387 --> 02:01:52.679
...cold.

02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:57.410
Parley?

02:02:57.453 --> 02:02:59.329
The ship is ours, gentlemen.

02:02:59.413 --> 02:03:01.873
Huzzah! Huzzah!

02:03:10.591 --> 02:03:11.591
Huzzah!

02:03:47.670 --> 02:03:50.004
We should return to the Dauntless.

02:03:52.550 --> 02:03:56.177
Your fiancÃ© will be wanting
to know you're safe.

02:04:05.855 --> 02:04:09.149
If you were waiting for
the opportune moment...

02:04:10.151 --> 02:04:11.484
...that was it.

02:04:12.945 --> 02:04:15.113
Now if you'd be so kind,
I'd be much obliged

02:04:15.197 --> 02:04:18.032
if you'd drop me off at my ship.

02:04:22.621 --> 02:04:24.789
I'm sorry, Jack.

02:04:26.709 --> 02:04:28.918
They done what's right by them.

02:04:29.003 --> 02:04:30.753
Can't expect more than that.

02:04:46.353 --> 02:04:47.687
Jack Sparrow!

02:04:47.730 --> 02:04:51.816
- We have learned that you...
- Captain! Captain Jack Sparrow.

02:04:52.526 --> 02:04:55.778
...for your wilful commission
of crimes against the crown.

02:04:55.863 --> 02:04:59.574
Said crimes being numerous in quantity,

02:04:59.658 --> 02:05:01.201
and sinister in nature.

02:05:01.869 --> 02:05:03.369
The most egregious of these

02:05:03.412 --> 02:05:05.622
to be cited herewith:

02:05:05.706 --> 02:05:09.459
- Piracy, smuggling...
- This is wrong.

02:05:10.461 --> 02:05:13.463
Commodore Norrington
is bound by the law,

02:05:13.547 --> 02:05:16.090
as are we all.

02:05:16.133 --> 02:05:18.843
...impersonating an officer
of the Spanish Royal Navy,

02:05:18.928 --> 02:05:22.013
impersonating a cleric
of the Church of England...

02:05:22.097 --> 02:05:23.223
Oh, yes!

02:05:23.265 --> 02:05:25.266
Sailing under false colours,

02:05:25.351 --> 02:05:29.562
arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching,

02:05:29.605 --> 02:05:35.568
brigandage, pilfering,
depravity, depredation,

02:05:35.611 --> 02:05:37.445
and general lawlessness.

02:05:38.822 --> 02:05:40.490
And for these crimes,

02:05:40.574 --> 02:05:43.117
you have been sentenced to be,
on this day,

02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:46.913
hung by the neck, until dead.

02:05:46.956 --> 02:05:49.249
May God have mercy on your soul.

02:05:49.291 --> 02:05:50.833
Governor Swann.

02:05:50.918 --> 02:05:52.835
Commodore.

02:05:54.338 --> 02:05:55.338
Elizabeth.

02:05:56.799 --> 02:05:59.634
I should've told you every day,
from the moment I met you.

02:06:01.470 --> 02:06:03.972
I love you.

02:06:18.529 --> 02:06:20.280
Boy, watch yourself!

02:06:20.322 --> 02:06:21.447
Marines!

02:06:21.490 --> 02:06:23.032
I can't breathe!

02:06:24.952 --> 02:06:25.952
Elizabeth!

02:06:28.956 --> 02:06:29.998
Move!

02:06:40.884 --> 02:06:43.094
You men! With me!

02:07:17.087 --> 02:07:18.087
Come on, men!

02:07:43.697 --> 02:07:47.700
I thought we might have to endure some
manner of ill-conceived escape attempt.

02:07:48.535 --> 02:07:50.119
But not from you.

02:07:50.204 --> 02:07:51.579
On our return to Port Royal,

02:07:51.664 --> 02:07:54.040
I granted you clemency.

02:07:54.083 --> 02:07:55.750
And this is how you thank me?

02:07:55.793 --> 02:07:57.877
By throwing in your lot with him?

02:07:57.920 --> 02:07:59.504
He's a pirate!

02:07:59.588 --> 02:08:01.547
And a good man.

02:08:02.341 --> 02:08:04.592
If all I've achieved here
is that the hangman

02:08:04.635 --> 02:08:06.761
will own two pairs
of boots instead of one,

02:08:06.845 --> 02:08:08.471
so be it.

02:08:08.555 --> 02:08:10.431
At least my conscience will be clear.

02:08:10.474 --> 02:08:13.434
You forget your place, Turner.

02:08:14.978 --> 02:08:16.604
It's right here,

02:08:16.647 --> 02:08:18.106
between you and Jack.

02:08:22.111 --> 02:08:23.778
As is mine.

02:08:23.862 --> 02:08:25.238
Elizabeth!

02:08:26.699 --> 02:08:27.865
Lower your weapons.

02:08:28.659 --> 02:08:30.660
For goodness sake, put them down!

02:08:35.749 --> 02:08:38.668
So this is where
your heart truly lies, then.

02:08:40.295 --> 02:08:41.796
It is.

02:08:50.305 --> 02:08:54.183
Well! I'm actually feeling
rather good about this.

02:08:54.268 --> 02:08:56.769
I think we've all arrived
at a very special place.

02:08:56.812 --> 02:08:57.895
Spiritually.

02:08:57.980 --> 02:08:59.981
Ecumenically.

02:09:00.065 --> 02:09:01.274
Grammatically.

02:09:02.735 --> 02:09:05.319
I want you to know that
I was rooting for you, mate.

02:09:06.613 --> 02:09:07.613
Know that.

02:09:11.618 --> 02:09:13.119
Elizabeth.

02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:17.665
It would never have worked
between us, darling.

02:09:19.126 --> 02:09:21.002
I'm sorry.

02:09:23.130 --> 02:09:24.130
Will!

02:09:26.425 --> 02:09:28.092
Nice hat.

02:09:30.053 --> 02:09:31.637
Friends!

02:09:33.557 --> 02:09:36.350
This the day that you will always

02:09:36.393 --> 02:09:39.020
remember as the day that...

02:09:43.984 --> 02:09:46.652
Idiot! He's nowhere to go
but back to the noose!

02:09:49.072 --> 02:09:50.907
Sail ho!

02:09:58.457 --> 02:10:01.083
What's your plan of action?

02:10:01.835 --> 02:10:02.835
Sir?

02:10:07.216 --> 02:10:09.675
Perhaps on the rare occasion

02:10:09.718 --> 02:10:13.596
pursuing the right course
demands an act of piracy,

02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:17.475
piracy itself can be the right course?

02:10:21.730 --> 02:10:23.022
Mr Turner!

02:10:29.112 --> 02:10:31.948
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

02:10:37.913 --> 02:10:39.539
This is a beautiful sword.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.751
I would expect the man who made it

02:10:43.794 --> 02:10:48.589
to show the same care and devotion
in every aspect of his life.

02:10:50.634 --> 02:10:52.385
Thank you.

02:10:55.264 --> 02:10:56.305
Commodore!

02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:58.099
What about Sparrow?

02:11:00.018 --> 02:11:02.937
Oh, I think we can afford
to give him one day's head start.

02:11:12.197 --> 02:11:15.283
This is the path you've chosen, is it?

02:11:16.660 --> 02:11:18.953
After all...

02:11:18.996 --> 02:11:20.538
...he is a blacksmith.

02:11:21.540 --> 02:11:22.790
No.

02:11:27.504 --> 02:11:29.797
He's a pirate.

02:11:53.989 --> 02:11:55.656
Bring him in!

02:12:06.043 --> 02:12:08.628
Thought you were supposed
to keep to the code.

02:12:08.670 --> 02:12:11.339
We figured they were more actual...

02:12:11.423 --> 02:12:13.382
...guidelines.

02:12:17.512 --> 02:12:19.221
Thank you.

02:12:20.349 --> 02:12:21.724
Captain Sparrow.

02:12:26.021 --> 02:12:27.605
The Black Pearl is yours!

02:12:43.413 --> 02:12:45.081
On deck, you scabrous dogs!

02:12:45.165 --> 02:12:46.624
Hands to braces!

02:12:46.708 --> 02:12:48.960
Let go and haul to run free.

02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:52.421
Now...

02:12:52.506 --> 02:12:54.340
Bring me that horizon.

02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:03.724
And really bad eggs

02:13:07.062 --> 02:13:09.563
Drink up, me hearties
Yo ho
