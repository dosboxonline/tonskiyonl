Yeah. Today was the last one.
No more singing.

11:46.747 --> 11:47.787
What? What are you sayin'?

11:47.957 --> 11:49.959
You always said
you wanted to be a singer.

11:50.167 --> 11:53.087
I told you, mom.
I'm gonna be an actress.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.631
Honey, we have all been
waiting for your new single,

11:55.798 --> 11:57.967
not to mention your uncle
over in yamaguchi

11:58.134 --> 12:01.262
said he'd buy twenty copies.
Do you realize that?

12:01.512 --> 12:02.952
[Sighs] You just don't
understand how

12:03.014 --> 12:04.390
this industry works, mom.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.476
Well, [do understand that
singing is what you do best.

12:07.601 --> 12:10.229
Morn, the pop idol image
is suffocating me!

12:10.438 --> 12:12.857
- Besides, today pop idols are...
- [Telephone ringing]

12:12.982 --> 12:15.151
Oh, wait. Another call.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.946

Mm, ah.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.039
[Beeping]

12:28.247 --> 12:31.751
Wrong number.
Uh-uh, they didn't say anything.

Yeah, I know what you mean.

12:34.670 --> 12:37.673

12:42.636 --> 12:44.013
[Water running]

12:44.180 --> 12:45.806
- [Telephone ringing]
- Oh, mother!

12:45.973 --> 12:47.516
Can't you just wait one minute?

12:47.850 --> 12:49.894
[Beeping, printing]

12:50.061 --> 12:52.480
A fax? Who's it from?

12:53.898 --> 12:55.024
{gasps}

12:58.527 --> 13:03.324
traitor traitor traitor

13:20.883 --> 13:23.052
- "Excuse me, who are you?"
- [Man] Open up.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.763
"Excuse me, who are you?"

13:26.514 --> 13:29.391
[Indistinct chatter]

13:31.519 --> 13:34.313
Must have been the first take.
They're both good.

13:35.523 --> 13:38.651
[Indistinct chatter]

13:38.818 --> 13:41.487
[Man] That's #5. Bring in #5

13:41.737 --> 13:43.364
[mirna] What do you think, rumi?

13:43.531 --> 13:45.324
Do you know what it means?

13:45.783 --> 13:48.244
[Yawns deeply]

13:50.746 --> 13:52.123
It's just a website.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.083
Somebody took it off
the Internet.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.919
Oh, that's really
popular lately.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.712
Huh, so what's it mean?

13:58.879 --> 14:01.257
Hmm... how can I describe it?

14:01.382 --> 14:04.426
It's kind of like networking
by using the computer.

14:04.593 --> 14:05.594
Yeah, and?

14:05.761 --> 14:08.097
Well, it looks like this person,
whoever it is,

14:08.264 --> 14:09.849
put up a link to "mima's room",

14:10.057 --> 14:12.184
which is the title
of the website.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.227
That make sense?

14:14.270 --> 14:15.771
[Giggles] Not one bit.

14:15.938 --> 14:16.730
[Man] Alright!

14:16.939 --> 14:18.607
Sorry to keep you waiting.

[Woman and man laugh]

14:27.449 --> 14:29.201
Don't make me laugh!

14:30.077 --> 14:31.453
But I like to hear you laugh.

14:32.580 --> 14:33.580
5 seconds!

14:33.873 --> 14:37.168
- 4, 3, 2...
- [Clears throat]

14:38.627 --> 14:40.796
The murder victim, rika,
her younger sister is here.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.381
Would you like to see her?

14:42.548 --> 14:44.216
Mr. Yamashiro.

14:45.342 --> 14:46.468
Yes?

14:46.677 --> 14:48.721
Tell me, do you have
any idea why the culprit

14:48.888 --> 14:50.806
peels off the skin
of his victims?

14:50.931 --> 14:53.184
Uh, I assume he gets

14:53.350 --> 14:56.228
sexual stimulation
from such activities.

14:56.937 --> 14:58.022
He wants to become one.

14:58.189 --> 14:59.732
Forgive me. Become what?

15:00.691 --> 15:03.903
A woman, or perhaps...

15:04.486 --> 15:05.946
[Director] Ah, cut!

15:06.197 --> 15:07.197
[Groans]

15:07.698 --> 15:10.743
Eri ochiai is a great
actress after all!

15:10.910 --> 15:13.037
She's a different person
so completely involved

15:13.204 --> 15:14.413
when the camera is rolling!

15:14.580 --> 15:15.623
[Director] That's good!

15:15.789 --> 15:18.167
[Man] Okay, scene 32!

- You nervous?
- A bit.

15:28.427 --> 15:29.511
Hmm.

15:33.557 --> 15:36.769
She only has one line.
What's she nervous about?

15:38.854 --> 15:41.106
Well, how's our
star actress so far?

15:41.357 --> 15:43.567
Mr. Tadokoro.
She's just going on now.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.698

15:51.283 --> 15:52.677
- People, this is a hot set.
- "Excuse..."

15:52.701 --> 15:54.262
- Please do not touch anything.
- [Slow piano music]

15:54.286 --> 15:57.081
- [Laughter, indistinct chatter]
- Get down people.

15:57.248 --> 15:59.128
- You see, that's what I mean!
- You believe it?

15:59.291 --> 16:01.293
[All laugh]

16:04.088 --> 16:06.131
[Man] Man, I'm exhausted.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.759
Eri looks very pretty,
doesn't she?

16:09.969 --> 16:12.129
[Man] Bring that in quickly,

16:24.400 --> 16:26.044
- [Man] You got it.
- Ugh, cup of coffee...

16:26.068 --> 16:27.486
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

16:28.237 --> 16:30.781
Good morning.
Well, hello, everyone.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.157
[All] Good morning.

16:32.283 --> 16:33.909
Mr. Shibuya,
you decided to come.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.118
Hi, eri, how's it going?

16:35.244 --> 16:36.787
How's my script
holdin' out for ya?

16:37.037 --> 16:39.623
Mm, your words are so difficult,
Mr. Shibuya.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.417
I think I'll have to quit.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.168
Eri, please don't say that.

16:43.377 --> 16:46.046
Oh, it's the best.
I just love it!

16:46.171 --> 16:47.756
You've really outdone yourself.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.508
Oh, you little devil, you.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.927
Eri, darling,
I have these fan letters.

16:52.052 --> 16:53.989
They were sent to the station.
They're all for you.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.223
Oh, thank you, Mr. Tejima.

16:56.432 --> 16:57.433
Kuro?

16:59.143 --> 17:01.687
Oh, this one's not for you.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.232
Well, keep up the good work.
I'm back to mine.

17:05.482 --> 17:07.776
So, Mr. Shibuya,
you have to tell me.

17:07.943 --> 17:09.343
Who ends up being
the criminal, hmm?

17:09.486 --> 17:12.948
Sorry, can't tell you.
That'd spoil the fun.

17:14.616 --> 17:17.243
So what are you going to
do about the criminal?

17:17.536 --> 17:20.497
You're running out of time.
You gotta make a decision soon.

17:20.664 --> 17:21.874
Mm...

17:23.041 --> 17:25.127
Good morning, Mr. Tejima.
Mr. Shibuya.

17:25.252 --> 17:28.380
How's everything going, huh?
How's everything?

17:28.797 --> 17:30.049
Ah, hello there.

17:30.257 --> 17:32.509
Everyone tells me that
mima's doing great.

17:32.676 --> 17:34.053
Well, if that's the case,

17:34.219 --> 17:37.348
don't you feel that she's
not doing enough? [Laughs]

17:37.639 --> 17:39.266
- Did you hear that, shibuya?
- Huh?

17:39.516 --> 17:41.769
Hey, don't look at me!
It's not my decision.

17:41.977 --> 17:44.313
Help me out here.
Please, would ya?

17:44.480 --> 17:47.358
Try and make use of mima
just a little bit more!

17:47.900 --> 17:50.778
Ah... she's a pop idol,
understand?

17:50.986 --> 17:52.237
They're just so hard to use.

17:52.363 --> 17:53.822
No problem! It's easy,

17:53.989 --> 17:55.741
she's done with
being a pop idol!

17:55.908 --> 17:56.908
Really?

17:57.117 --> 18:00.120
[Tadokoro] We also want to give
her a drastic image change.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.122
[Man] We 're ready for the take!

18:04.666 --> 18:06.877
Almost forgot, this is for mima.

18:07.252 --> 18:08.962
Your hair is, like,
shining in the light.

18:09.129 --> 18:10.130
It's very pretty.

18:10.297 --> 18:11.840
"Excuse me, who are you?"

18:12.007 --> 18:13.217
"Excuse me, who are you?"

18:13.384 --> 18:14.676
5 seconds!

18:14.927 --> 18:18.347
- "Excuse me..."
- 4, 3, 2...

18:24.937 --> 18:26.230
Mr. Tadokoro?

18:27.147 --> 18:28.857
Oh, my god, what happened?

18:30.859 --> 18:32.903
- [Grunts]
- Mr. Tadokoro!

18:37.157 --> 18:38.367
I'm alright.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.577
What in the hell was that?

18:41.161 --> 18:43.330
I think that the
letter just exploded.

18:43.497 --> 18:45.457
Call an ambulance quick!

18:45.582 --> 18:46.667
[Man] Got it!

18:47.418 --> 18:51.338
Is a warning.
The next one will be real.

19:15.529 --> 19:18.532
[Sighs] Okay, we're all set now.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.742
Rumi, you're so amazing!
Thank you!

19:20.909 --> 19:23.787
And now, I'll sign you up
for online services, okay?

19:23.954 --> 19:24.997
Okay.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.373
Oh...

19:26.957 --> 19:29.668
Rumi, I was just
wondering about...

19:29.877 --> 19:30.711
About what?

19:30.878 --> 19:32.439
- About the other day.
- [Keyboard clacking]

19:32.463 --> 19:35.048
Oh, that? Okay...

19:35.424 --> 19:37.551
Credit card number...

19:38.677 --> 19:40.029
Don't you think we
should have at least

19:40.053 --> 19:41.638
let the police know about it?

19:42.347 --> 19:44.057
Mr. Tadokoro said not to.

19:44.224 --> 19:46.643
He doesn't want us to
do anything about it.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.272
But it was... I mean,
a crime was committed.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.458
And if you think about it,

19:51.482 --> 19:53.567
I could have been the one
that opened that letter.

19:53.692 --> 19:56.236
Everything's okay now.
It was just a prank.

19:56.361 --> 19:58.739
Fortunately, Mr. Tadokoro
wasn't badly hurt,

19:58.947 --> 20:01.992
so you shouldn't worry about
it anymore, mima, alright?

20:02.826 --> 20:04.095
- Yeah...
- Now I have to explain

20:04.119 --> 20:06.038
this all to you,
so listen carefully.

20:06.246 --> 20:07.246
Okay!

20:07.706 --> 20:10.209
This is a browser for
the world wide web.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.753
You launch it by
double-clicking here.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.380
[Mirna] What? Double-clip?

20:15.964 --> 20:17.404
What are you going
to do with a clip?

20:17.508 --> 20:18.748
I thought that's what you said!

20:18.884 --> 20:21.887
No, see, at the location here,
you enter the url.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.223
It's really not that
difficult to understand.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.433
Oh, rumi, come on!

20:26.600 --> 20:29.561
Will you please explain
it to me in English?

20:29.770 --> 20:31.897
Oh, boy.
Whatever gave you the idea

20:32.064 --> 20:33.524
to buy a computer anyway?

20:33.690 --> 20:36.026
Because they said it was easy!

20:36.193 --> 20:39.029
Alright, I'll explain it from
the beginning once more.

the illusion within ourselves,

only one fixed persona.

Mr. Shibuya the screenwriter?

Yeah, it's really hard,
but it's what I've chosen to do.

she's some new, young,

Yoko takakura,
the original persona,

01:01:15.004 --> 01:01:18.508
is nothing more than a made-up
character in a drama for her.

in a strip club,

01:01:23.638 --> 01:01:26.557

of her drama series.

she salvaged her own heart.

01:01:53.918 --> 01:01:57.922

she salvaged her own heart.
