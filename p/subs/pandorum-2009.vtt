02:23.757 --> 02:26.282
Recording:
You're all that's left of us.

02:26.326 --> 02:30.160
Good luck.
God bless.

02:30.197 --> 02:32.791
And Godspeed.

05:24.070 --> 05:26.402
Bower.

05:50.797 --> 05:52.492
Bower.

06:14.220 --> 06:17.781
"In the event
of mild memory loss

06:17.824 --> 06:22.523
resulting from
extended hypersleep... "

06:54.594 --> 06:56.619
Lieutenant!

06:57.630 --> 06:59.393
Lieutenant Payton!

08:17.310 --> 08:19.904
Hey. Hey.

08:27.720 --> 08:30.245
- Who are you?
- I'm Bower.

08:30.290 --> 08:32.724
Corporal Bower, sir.

08:32.759 --> 08:35.318
Bower?
Bower?

08:35.361 --> 08:37.852
You're waking
from extended hypersleep.

08:37.897 --> 08:40.695
- Bower?
- This is disorientation.

08:40.732 --> 08:42.792
Could you get that
fucking light out of my eyes?

08:42.836 --> 08:44.133
Sorry, sir.

08:46.005 --> 08:47.597
Where are we?

08:47.640 --> 08:49.631
Aboard the Elysium.

08:51.177 --> 08:53.645
The Elysium?

08:53.680 --> 08:56.581
Where are we?

08:56.616 --> 08:58.880
I don't know.

08:58.918 --> 09:01.250
Where's the rest of the crew?

09:02.956 --> 09:04.548
Is it our shift?

09:04.591 --> 09:07.355
- Our rotation?
- I believe so.

09:07.393 --> 09:09.520
Aren't they supposed
to be here to wake us up?

09:09.562 --> 09:11.393
I don't know.

09:15.702 --> 09:17.966
Hit the lights, will you?

09:19.772 --> 09:22.366
There's a problem
with the power, sir.

09:25.411 --> 09:27.003
Who woke you up?

09:27.046 --> 09:29.344
It had to have been
the flight computer.

09:29.382 --> 09:31.976
There's no one here
except us.

09:32.018 --> 09:34.509
It's cold.

09:34.554 --> 09:37.580
I've been awake for over an hour
and I still can't remember anything.

09:39.726 --> 09:42.194
The last time I crawled out
of a hyperbunk

09:42.228 --> 09:44.890
it took me quite a while
to get it all back.

09:44.931 --> 09:47.399
What was your-

09:47.433 --> 09:49.367
what was your last flight, sir?

09:49.402 --> 09:51.370
I don't know.

09:51.404 --> 09:53.372
Sir, do you even know
where we're going?

09:53.406 --> 09:56.273
I remember the training,

09:56.309 --> 09:59.642
but not the destination,
the mission.

09:59.679 --> 10:01.874
I figured you'd tell me.

10:01.915 --> 10:03.405
Payton:
If this really is our ship,

10:03.449 --> 10:05.542
then this room should
be locked into position

10:05.585 --> 10:08.679
and behind that door
should be the bridge.

10:08.721 --> 10:10.882
Jesus.

10:10.924 --> 10:12.983
Somebody was trying to get out.

10:18.798 --> 10:21.232
Lieutenant.

10:21.267 --> 10:23.701
None of the activators are working.

10:23.736 --> 10:25.033
Yeah, it figures.

10:26.472 --> 10:28.599
Without unified threading
we can't connect.

10:28.641 --> 10:30.404
Hold on here.

10:30.443 --> 10:32.843
We can at least
get this station to work.

10:42.655 --> 10:45.123
I didn't even think of that.

10:47.460 --> 10:49.894
All right. Jesus.

10:52.432 --> 10:55.959
Lieutenant Payton on the com.
Anybody copy?

10:57.971 --> 11:01.270
This is Lieutenant Payton
of flight team-

11:02.942 --> 11:05.103
Shit.

11:05.144 --> 11:07.169
- 5.
- How do you know that?

11:12.018 --> 11:14.646
This is Lieutenant Payton
of flight team 5.

11:14.687 --> 11:16.917
Anybody copy?

11:16.956 --> 11:19.891
Anyone respond.

11:21.494 --> 11:23.428
This is Lieutenant Payton
of flight team 5.

11:23.463 --> 11:25.556
Anybody awake up there?

11:25.598 --> 11:28.192
Team 4 is supposed
to be here for flight rotation.

11:28.234 --> 11:29.929
Where could they be?

11:31.604 --> 11:33.469
Maybe they couldn't get to us.

11:36.909 --> 11:38.843
Where did he go?

11:47.153 --> 11:51.317
Power systems must be free floating
between uncoupled circuits,

11:51.357 --> 11:54.019
or something the override grid
won't even lock in.

11:54.060 --> 11:55.550
What do you think?

11:59.365 --> 12:01.026
Somebody's up there.

12:03.603 --> 12:06.367
Uh, it's ventilation.

12:06.406 --> 12:08.897
The system keeps rebooting
after each surge.

12:08.941 --> 12:10.238
That could be anything.

12:10.276 --> 12:14.212
Listen, I think we should
get out of here.

12:14.247 --> 12:17.410
I'd rather be up and out
than stuck in the trunk, wouldn't you?

12:18.418 --> 12:19.712
Test test.

12:19.752 --> 12:22.152
Payton: Copy.

12:25.691 --> 12:26.885
Lift me up.

12:33.966 --> 12:35.763
Our 2nd lieutenant must
have come through here.

12:35.802 --> 12:37.997
It's the only way.

12:41.340 --> 12:42.739
It's fucking dark in here.

12:42.775 --> 12:44.743
Payton: Don't worry.
Just take the first way out.

12:44.777 --> 12:47.974
I'll guide you back here to open
the doors from the outside.

12:52.051 --> 12:53.916
How are we doing?

12:53.953 --> 12:55.750
See anything?

12:55.788 --> 12:57.415
Nothing yet.

12:57.457 --> 13:00.392
Not a single vent opening
or anything.

13:00.426 --> 13:03.156
What about on your end?

13:04.664 --> 13:08.031
Power surges keep happening
in longer increments just like you said.

13:08.067 --> 13:10.467
Reactor timing is offset in the core.

13:10.503 --> 13:14.337
It's trying to reconnect.

13:14.373 --> 13:16.273
But it won't until it's reset.

13:16.309 --> 13:18.402
Payton:
How do you know that?

13:20.313 --> 13:23.407
I don't know.
I can't even remember my- Jesus Christ!

13:26.352 --> 13:29.651
But I know everything there is
to know about that damn reactor.

13:29.689 --> 13:32.487
Payton:
That's the training talking.

13:32.525 --> 13:34.117
You must be our technical engineer.

13:41.834 --> 13:43.426
Found an intersection.

13:43.469 --> 13:45.903
Copy that.
Anything look promising?

13:45.938 --> 13:48.634
A whole lot of the same-
nothing.

14:01.988 --> 14:04.513
- Taking a left. Make a note.
- Payton: Left it is.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.273
Payton.

14:29.415 --> 14:31.849
Payton!
Payton, do you copy?

14:31.884 --> 14:34.614
I don't know if I'm going in circles.

14:35.788 --> 14:39.121
And, um, I can't breathe.

14:39.158 --> 14:42.389
Payton, do you copy?

14:42.428 --> 14:44.328
Payton:
I'm here. I'm here.

14:45.898 --> 14:48.890
Easy now, easy. Breathe.
Just listen to me.

14:48.935 --> 14:51.460
- I just want to stand up.
- Calm down.

14:51.504 --> 14:54.200
- I can't breathe.
- Stop it and listen to me.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.367
- Now let's just get you back here.
- Back?

14:56.409 --> 14:59.845
Are you fucking kidding me?
I can't even turn around.

14:59.879 --> 15:02.370
Do you know
how far I've gone, Payton?

15:02.415 --> 15:05.179
- Listen to me.
- I just want out of this fucking thing!

15:05.218 --> 15:08.415
Payton:
Put your mind somewhere else.

15:08.454 --> 15:11.150
Like where?

15:11.190 --> 15:13.283
This may not be
the best time to tell you,

15:13.326 --> 15:14.987
but I got the door open.

15:17.296 --> 15:19.628
You fucking kidding me?

15:19.665 --> 15:22.600
Yeah, I'm kidding you.

15:25.972 --> 15:28.566
You see?
Now that's not so bad.

15:28.608 --> 15:31.600
We're gonna get you through this.
We're gonna figure this out together.

15:31.644 --> 15:33.669
- You hear me?
- Uh-huh.

15:33.713 --> 15:35.476
You spent eight years
in the hyperbunk.

15:35.514 --> 15:37.778
A couple of more minutes
in a shaft won't kill you.

15:37.817 --> 15:39.011
Eight years?

15:39.051 --> 15:42.179
I do remember two years
being our duty rotation.

15:42.221 --> 15:45.816
If we're team 5, that means
we've been out for eight years.

15:45.858 --> 15:48.383
I don't think
you're here by default.

15:48.427 --> 15:51.453
You were a select pick.
We all were.

15:51.497 --> 15:53.965
This was something special.

15:55.935 --> 15:57.232
Someone's been through here.

15:59.372 --> 16:01.636
- Wait a second.
- What's wrong?

16:03.643 --> 16:06.578
I'm at an angle.
Oh shit, I'm at an angle.

16:06.612 --> 16:07.909
I'm at an angle!

16:11.484 --> 16:14.453
Bower, what happened?

16:19.091 --> 16:21.286
What is it?

16:21.327 --> 16:24.262
Bower, are you hurt?

16:32.738 --> 16:34.831
Bower, what happened?

16:37.310 --> 16:39.403
I can hear you breathing.
Are you all right?

17:13.512 --> 17:16.037
Can you hear me?

17:23.321 --> 17:26.883
Bower, are you all right?

17:29.028 --> 17:31.258
I've- I've found Cooper.

17:31.297 --> 17:34.266
He's dead.
I'm in a boot locker.

17:38.137 --> 17:40.367
Bower?

17:42.241 --> 17:43.401
You all right?

17:48.180 --> 17:51.377
Make that an overhead compartment.

17:51.417 --> 17:53.942
Payton, I got out.

17:55.955 --> 17:59.516
Payton?

17:59.558 --> 18:01.492
Bower, do you hear me?

18:01.527 --> 18:03.461
Do you read?

18:16.675 --> 18:18.700
Payton, are you there?

18:18.744 --> 18:21.042
Payton, can you hear me?

18:40.533 --> 18:42.626
Payton, do you copy?

18:45.771 --> 18:48.103
Payton?

18:48.140 --> 18:50.574
Corporal, can you hear me?

18:52.945 --> 18:54.845
Corporal, can you hear me?

19:18.537 --> 19:20.300
Hey.

19:20.339 --> 19:22.864
Hey, I need to talk to you!

19:22.908 --> 19:25.001
Wait! Stop!

19:31.383 --> 19:33.510
Don't run again, okay?

19:33.552 --> 19:36.544
I don't care if you were
stealing or anything.

19:39.158 --> 19:41.490
I just want to ask you
a couple questions.

19:44.430 --> 19:46.762
How are you awake?

19:52.137 --> 19:53.627
Hello?

19:55.074 --> 19:57.133
Hello!

19:57.176 --> 19:59.736
What, are you fucking deaf?

20:04.016 --> 20:05.278
Hello?

20:06.719 --> 20:08.687
Jesus!

20:38.951 --> 20:41.647
What?

20:45.558 --> 20:47.150
Don't move.

20:48.360 --> 20:52.194
Wait. Wait a second.
I'm with the flight crew.

20:54.833 --> 20:56.460
Don't you move.

20:56.502 --> 20:58.800
Really, I'm part of the flight crew.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.465
- Take them off.
- What?

21:03.509 --> 21:05.773
Shoes.

21:05.811 --> 21:08.211
I'll gut your ass.

22:35.501 --> 22:36.832
What the?

23:23.949 --> 23:25.541
Payton:
Bower, do you read?

23:54.813 --> 23:56.644
God damn it, answer me.

24:09.194 --> 24:10.991
Payton:
Bower, do you hear me?

24:12.297 --> 24:14.390
Do you read?

24:15.901 --> 24:17.493
You are not hearing me.

24:17.536 --> 24:20.596
There's no procedure for this.
They can't write a book for this.

24:20.639 --> 24:23.107
After what I just saw, procedure
just went out the fucking window.

24:23.142 --> 24:25.110
Payton:
Listen, I need you to calm down.

24:25.144 --> 24:27.704
You're all we've got out there
if we're gonna figure this out.

24:27.746 --> 24:29.976
Let's get back to these-
these other guys.

24:30.015 --> 24:33.246
Guys?
Those weren't guys.

24:33.285 --> 24:35.753
They were hunting.

24:35.788 --> 24:39.155
They- they took Cooper's body.

24:39.191 --> 24:41.921
Just Like a fucking pack of-

24:43.529 --> 24:46.191
They didn't seem human.

24:46.231 --> 24:49.689
We have to try
and contact the bridge.

24:49.735 --> 24:53.193
You're assuming that there
is someone on the bridge.

24:53.238 --> 24:55.536
There has to be.

24:55.574 --> 24:57.166
We can't be alone in this.

24:57.209 --> 24:59.268
Well, alone or not,

24:59.311 --> 25:01.802
we can't assume help will be coming.

25:03.482 --> 25:07.441
Out here there is no rescue
and there is no turning around.

25:07.486 --> 25:10.683
I don't think this thing
was even built to return.

25:10.722 --> 25:12.155
What are you talking about?

25:12.191 --> 25:15.160
I'm saying that this
is no ordinary transport.

25:15.194 --> 25:17.594
We're not out on the belt
collecting data.

25:17.629 --> 25:20.223
We're not hauling cargo.

25:20.265 --> 25:23.325
We are the cargo.

25:24.403 --> 25:27.998
60,000 people
on a single launch trajectory.

25:28.040 --> 25:30.474
Tanis.

25:30.509 --> 25:33.137
Man on TV:
25 billion people watched in awe.

25:33.178 --> 25:36.045
These breathtaking images
of Tanis arrived

25:36.081 --> 25:38.811
from the Popolous probe and were
broadcast yesterday.

25:38.851 --> 25:41.251
These were taken as the probe
was entering the orbit

25:41.286 --> 25:43.914
of the only Earth Like planet
known to exist.

25:43.956 --> 25:47.448
People of the whole world are watching
as the probe sent into space

25:47.492 --> 25:52.020
is transferring data exceeding
even the most optimistic expectations.

25:52.064 --> 25:54.498
We knew to expect water on Tanis.

25:54.533 --> 25:56.797
We knew to expect
reasonable temperatures.

25:56.835 --> 25:58.564
But the questioned remained-

25:58.604 --> 26:02.267
will this planet meet the extremely
complex and unlikely combination

26:02.307 --> 26:05.674
of parameters to support life
as we know it?

26:05.711 --> 26:08.475
The probe has touched down
on the planet six days ago.

26:08.513 --> 26:10.572
It's sending off its first transmission

26:10.616 --> 26:13.585
that is expected
to arrive any second now.

26:25.397 --> 26:27.627
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:27.666 --> 26:31.124
this is an unprecedented
moment for all mankind.

26:31.169 --> 26:33.637
Are we seeing this?

26:33.672 --> 26:35.867
First detection as we had hoped.

26:35.908 --> 26:38.138
This needs to be verified,
but it appears

26:38.176 --> 26:40.940
some form of plant life is present.

26:40.979 --> 26:44.642
My God, life on Tanis.
There is life detection.

26:44.683 --> 26:46.776
We have habitat detection.

26:46.818 --> 26:49.878
Verified, this is a monumental
day for all of us.

26:49.922 --> 26:53.016
Only a matter of time before
we send people out there.

26:53.058 --> 26:55.219
Processing and population.

26:55.260 --> 26:57.057
We're a settlers vessel.

26:57.095 --> 26:59.188
Elysium was a one-way ticket.

27:01.166 --> 27:03.134
How could I have...

27:03.168 --> 27:04.567
left her?

27:06.271 --> 27:08.068
How could I have done that?

27:10.876 --> 27:12.400
I loved her.

27:16.248 --> 27:18.216
Payton:
We've got to get to the bridge.

27:18.250 --> 27:21.845
We've got to get control of the ship
before these guys rip it apart.

27:21.887 --> 27:23.411
This is too fucking important.

27:23.455 --> 27:26.151
- Payton, where is your wife?
- What?

27:26.191 --> 27:28.716
Do you remember the recruitment?
The breeding tests,

27:28.760 --> 27:30.421
the husbands, the wives?

27:30.462 --> 27:34.228
We didn't leave them behind.
They're here somewhere onboard.

27:57.356 --> 28:00.223
I've got to find her before
these fucking animals do.

28:00.258 --> 28:02.488
Try to think.
Where would they be?

28:02.527 --> 28:04.654
A sleeping compartment
for non-service personnel?

28:04.696 --> 28:06.493
Wait, hold on.
Think for a second.

28:06.531 --> 28:08.499
I remember there were thousands
of passengers that weren't part

28:08.533 --> 28:11.058
- of the development team. Families.
- You listen to me.

28:11.103 --> 28:14.470
You know how big this ship is?
And you have no idea where your wife-

28:14.506 --> 28:17.532
where our wives might be.

28:17.576 --> 28:20.067
If you go off on some
wild goose chase

28:20.112 --> 28:24.208
we're gonna be no closer to getting
ourselves out of this situation

28:24.249 --> 28:27.184
and with even less time
to regain control of the ship.

28:27.219 --> 28:31.383
Once we've taken control of the systems,
finding them will be easy.

28:31.423 --> 28:33.323
Are you hearing me?

28:34.593 --> 28:37.687
We save the ship,
we save them.

28:45.737 --> 28:48.433
- Security locker.
- What?

28:52.811 --> 28:55.279
Non-lethal antiriot guns.

28:55.313 --> 28:57.975
Payton:
Close up they'll do some damage.

29:27.746 --> 29:30.010
All right, I'm gonna lay out
a path for you

29:30.048 --> 29:32.778
and try to bypass
the main security grids.

29:32.818 --> 29:36.345
Without main power
we'll never get these doors open.

29:36.388 --> 29:39.414
Listen, if you can get me
to the reactor bay

29:39.458 --> 29:42.052
I can reset the cycle manually.

29:42.094 --> 29:44.085
Payton:
You know how to do that?

29:44.129 --> 29:46.962
- Yeah.
- It's a long way.

29:46.998 --> 29:49.899
Gonna have to get you past
a few security bulkheads.

29:49.935 --> 29:52.267
With a little sidestepping,
we're gonna get you there.

29:56.708 --> 29:59.802
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Delta 81643 Lima.

29:59.845 --> 30:01.278
Okay okay, hold on.

30:01.313 --> 30:03.508
I don't want you going too far.
Just catch your breath.

30:03.548 --> 30:05.516
I don't need a rest.
Just tell me which way.

30:05.550 --> 30:07.745
I don't know yet.
Hold on.

30:17.162 --> 30:19.027
Payton.

30:23.502 --> 30:27.404
Pandorum, you ever
felt the symptoms?

30:28.840 --> 30:31.206
Of all the things to remember,
why would you pick that?

30:34.713 --> 30:36.874
Were you thinking
of the Eden mission?

30:36.915 --> 30:38.849
What about the Eden?

30:40.785 --> 30:45.051
You just had to remind me of the biggest
fucking catastrophe in space travel.

30:46.491 --> 30:48.982
The flight cautionary tale from hell.

30:49.027 --> 30:51.495
I remember.
Didn't they have some kind of

30:51.530 --> 30:54.966
hypersleep malfunction?

30:55.000 --> 30:58.060
Payton: Two years into their shift
one of their officers

30:58.103 --> 31:00.469
had a psychological breakdown.

31:00.505 --> 31:03.804
The doctors refer
to it as ODS syndrome.

31:03.842 --> 31:07.710
But the pilots,
we call it pandorum.

31:08.914 --> 31:12.611
It drove him insane. He became
convinced the flight was cursed.

31:13.985 --> 31:16.044
- Evil.
- Bower: What did he do?

31:17.756 --> 31:19.917
Payton:
He evacuated the ship.

31:22.928 --> 31:26.329
He launched them all
into oblivion.

31:26.364 --> 31:29.492
5,000 people sent to their death

31:29.534 --> 31:31.399
with one push of a button.

31:34.606 --> 31:37.404
Bower: At least we didn't wake up
floating away in a coffin.

31:39.844 --> 31:42.005
Payton:
Who says we didn't?

31:52.157 --> 31:54.625
- Which way?
- Left at the third marker.

31:54.659 --> 31:57.651
Just two more levels up
and we're on the main walkway.

31:57.696 --> 31:59.163
Should be easy from there.

32:09.241 --> 32:11.368
This can't be right.

32:11.409 --> 32:13.673
What's not right?

32:13.712 --> 32:16.772
I don't know if I'm hallucinating.

32:18.416 --> 32:20.509
What?
What's going on?

32:20.552 --> 32:23.316
I've seen this before.
This is a-

32:30.862 --> 32:32.625
this-

32:32.664 --> 32:35.155
this is a different one.

32:42.173 --> 32:44.004
It's booby-trapped.

32:44.042 --> 32:46.135
Rigged the ceiling.

32:46.177 --> 32:47.610
Payton: Be careful.

32:50.682 --> 32:53.048
No! No!

32:53.084 --> 32:55.109
No!

32:55.153 --> 32:56.518
Quiet!

32:58.790 --> 33:01.418
Quiet! Shh.

33:01.459 --> 33:03.791
We have to shut the hell up.
Do you understand?

33:03.828 --> 33:06.319
I'm gonna get you out of this,
but you have to be quiet.

33:06.364 --> 33:08.423
You understand?

33:11.303 --> 33:13.430
Payton:
Bower, you sure this is a good idea?

33:16.675 --> 33:19.143
Watch yourself.

33:23.415 --> 33:25.007
He's team 6.

33:25.050 --> 33:28.679
That's the shift unit
that's supposed to follow us.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.984
Payton: He could be-

33:31.022 --> 33:32.649
Quiet. Quiet!

33:32.691 --> 33:35.819
Easy. I'm not gonna hurt you
but you have to be quiet.

33:35.860 --> 33:38.260
Do you hear me?

33:40.999 --> 33:44.093
Shepard, team 6, sir.

33:45.403 --> 33:47.667
I believe I'm the only one.

33:47.706 --> 33:50.368
I knew it.
I knew you'd come back.

33:50.408 --> 33:52.603
- What?
- Where's your squad?

33:52.644 --> 33:55.408
Squad?
This is my lieutenant.

33:55.447 --> 33:58.041
- Where's your shuttle?
- Shuttle? What are you talking about?

33:58.083 --> 33:59.880
You're the retraction crew, right?

33:59.918 --> 34:03.046
No. No.
I'm team 5.

34:03.088 --> 34:06.114
- You just woke up?
- Six or eight hours ago.

34:06.157 --> 34:07.419
So you don't know
what the fuck is going on?

34:07.459 --> 34:08.858
That's what I'm saying.

34:08.893 --> 34:11.862
- You know as much as me, man.
- I don't know anything.

34:11.896 --> 34:14.956
You, you're gonna fit right in.

34:17.402 --> 34:18.801
What are you doing?

34:18.837 --> 34:20.168
- Get the scent off.
- Scent?

34:20.205 --> 34:22.105
They're fast and they're fucking
stronger than you know.

34:22.139 --> 34:25.405
They come after you, you run.
You run and you don't fucking look back.

34:25.443 --> 34:27.070
I can't wait for you.

34:27.112 --> 34:30.138
Who- who are they?

34:30.181 --> 34:31.808
- I can't help you.
- Help me.

34:31.850 --> 34:34.819
Payton: Bower, you tell that asshole
the chain of command

34:34.853 --> 34:37.253
- and a direct order is being made.
- You're still an officer on this ship,

34:37.288 --> 34:39.449
and at the current time
your CO is ordering you...

34:39.491 --> 34:41.652
- Ordering me? That's funny.
- ... now is ordering you-

34:41.693 --> 34:43.592
You're late.
There's no fucking CO on this ship.

34:43.628 --> 34:44.925
Fuck you.

35:00.678 --> 35:01.770
That's not gonna save you.

35:08.386 --> 35:09.978
Payton:
Get the hell out of there.

35:11.723 --> 35:13.588
Get out of there!

35:32.310 --> 35:34.005
Ah!

35:43.655 --> 35:44.952
Go.

36:18.857 --> 36:20.222
Just run.
Go!

37:34.732 --> 37:36.199
I don't understand.

37:57.355 --> 37:59.346
Thanks.

38:09.534 --> 38:11.832
I- I don't understand.

38:14.639 --> 38:17.039
I don't know what you're saying.

38:17.075 --> 38:19.600
I- I don't understand.

38:23.715 --> 38:25.979
Agriculture.

38:26.017 --> 38:27.609
You're with agriculture.

38:29.854 --> 38:32.254
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm with the flight crew.

38:32.290 --> 38:35.657
But I don't know-
I don't know what happened.

38:37.161 --> 38:40.130
Yeah, I know that,
but I'm not in charge here.

38:40.164 --> 38:42.655
I'm trying to find out
what happened to the ship.

38:42.700 --> 38:44.998
S- ship.

38:45.036 --> 38:46.799
Ship.

38:46.838 --> 38:49.432
I'm on my way to the reactor.

38:49.474 --> 38:51.169
Reactor.

38:51.209 --> 38:53.234
Reactor, that's right.
Exactly right.

38:53.277 --> 38:56.075
But that doesn't concern you.
You stay here.

38:56.114 --> 39:00.551
You stay put and wait for the...

39:02.220 --> 39:05.189
security to reengage.

39:05.223 --> 39:08.989
And I'm gonna handle this problem.

39:09.027 --> 39:10.551
Okay?

39:32.383 --> 39:35.352
God damn it.

39:48.332 --> 39:51.165
Who's there?

39:57.909 --> 40:00.776
Identify yourself.

40:00.812 --> 40:02.939
Bower?

40:02.980 --> 40:05.574
Is that you, Bower?

40:08.086 --> 40:10.077
That can't be you.

41:33.538 --> 41:35.233
You again.

42:03.467 --> 42:07.267
I understand that it's felt

42:07.305 --> 42:09.705
Like every man for himself.

42:09.740 --> 42:13.608
If we're going to get out of this...

42:13.644 --> 42:17.808
a little fucking solidarity

42:17.849 --> 42:20.317
goes a long way.

42:24.288 --> 42:26.256
We all want to survive,

42:26.290 --> 42:28.656
right?

42:28.693 --> 42:31.127
I lost contact with my CO.

42:31.162 --> 42:33.995
So I need someone to tell me
how to get to the reactor.

42:37.401 --> 42:39.767
You know?
That's great.

42:39.804 --> 42:42.671
All right, we can work together

42:42.707 --> 42:44.971
as a team.

42:54.418 --> 42:56.181
Go.

43:05.263 --> 43:06.696
Yeah.

43:13.838 --> 43:15.999
Yeah well, no sympathy here, pal.

43:16.040 --> 43:18.270
She left me with
a few sore spots too.

43:20.611 --> 43:22.636
Why the hell should I trust you?

43:22.680 --> 43:26.446
- Listen, lady, we don't want any-
- Are you really part of the flight crew?

43:26.484 --> 43:29.248
Corporal Bower,
ship's mechanical engineer.

43:36.027 --> 43:38.757
I didn't think
there was any flight crew left.

43:40.197 --> 43:42.188
What's happened to us?

43:42.233 --> 43:44.565
A malfunction of some sort.

43:44.602 --> 43:48.003
You think?
What's your plan?

43:48.039 --> 43:50.599
Fire up the reactor.
Go from there.

43:50.641 --> 43:52.768
- You just wake up?
- Yeah.

43:52.810 --> 43:55.643
- Just joined the party.
- You'll never make it.

43:55.680 --> 43:58.274
- Why is that?
- You're going the wrong direction.

44:00.117 --> 44:01.914
- Wait a second.
- Keep it down.

44:01.953 --> 44:03.887
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

44:03.921 --> 44:06.389
- I need you to show me the way.
- To the reactor?

44:06.424 --> 44:08.585
I don't Like going that far down.

44:10.928 --> 44:13.089
No one ever comes back.

44:13.130 --> 44:16.361
We don't have much time.

44:16.400 --> 44:19.233
We could lose everything onboard.
Do you know what I'm saying to you?

44:19.270 --> 44:21.397
Can you fly it?

44:21.439 --> 44:24.306
Can you fly the ship?

44:24.342 --> 44:25.832
Land it if you have to?

44:28.379 --> 44:30.176
Yeah.

44:34.986 --> 44:36.817
How long have you been awake?

44:36.854 --> 44:39.880
Don't know.
There's no way to tell time in here.

44:39.924 --> 44:41.892
- Five, maybe six months.
- Months?

44:41.926 --> 44:44.554
Quiet.
You want to get us killed?

44:48.566 --> 44:50.431
What are we doing?

44:50.468 --> 44:53.528
- We are waiting.
- Waiting for what?

44:56.240 --> 44:59.676
You want to get to the reactor?
Then trust me.

45:05.683 --> 45:09.312
Oh shit.
Hey, we have to go.

45:09.353 --> 45:10.911
Trust me.

45:10.955 --> 45:13.082
We've got to go now.

45:13.124 --> 45:15.957
- We've got to go now.
- Wait.

45:15.993 --> 45:17.790
We've got to go now.

45:42.953 --> 45:44.818
What the hell are they?

45:44.855 --> 45:47.255
Never quite felt Like sticking
around to find out.

45:47.291 --> 45:49.885
Running is always the best option.

45:49.927 --> 45:51.827
They can't be from this ship.

45:59.503 --> 46:01.061
What is all this?

46:01.105 --> 46:03.164
Ecological development.

46:03.207 --> 46:06.574
Embryonic charter, livestock
and wildlife repopulation.

46:06.610 --> 46:10.046
You live here?
You protect all this?

46:11.749 --> 46:13.614
To us it seemed worth protecting.

46:13.651 --> 46:15.312
Us?

46:16.754 --> 46:19.120
When I woke up,
there were five if us.

46:20.424 --> 46:23.450
I was part of the Brandenburg Institute's
genetic sampling team.

46:23.494 --> 46:26.657
Seven years collecting
and readying earth's biosphere-

46:26.697 --> 46:29.723
just didn't feel right handing it off.

46:31.602 --> 46:34.799
I volunteered to go along with it.

46:38.909 --> 46:41.707
This...

46:41.745 --> 46:43.906
truly is Noah's Ark.

46:43.948 --> 46:48.146
This archive holds the world
we are going to live in.

46:48.185 --> 46:51.951
We've already lost about
30% of the specimens.

46:53.057 --> 46:56.356
The lab has its own generator,
but without the reactor working,

46:56.393 --> 46:59.055
I don't know if they
will ever make it to Tanis.

46:59.096 --> 47:00.996
Tanis.

47:01.031 --> 47:03.522
You couldn't remember?

47:03.567 --> 47:05.626
I couldn't remember how-

47:05.669 --> 47:08.103
how far away it was.

47:08.139 --> 47:10.869
This was a 123-year flight.

47:10.908 --> 47:13.035
Consider yourself lucky.

47:13.077 --> 47:15.671
It took me months to recall.

47:15.713 --> 47:18.307
It took even longer to get
that goddamn door open.

47:18.349 --> 47:21.250
It comes on in pieces.

47:22.486 --> 47:25.353
I know everything about this vault
and its systems.

47:26.657 --> 47:29.091
But I still can't remember
where I grew up...

47:30.961 --> 47:33.054
or my brother's name.

47:33.097 --> 47:36.191
Are you hungry?

47:36.233 --> 47:38.224
Yeah, I'm starving.

47:42.306 --> 47:44.331
Here.

47:44.375 --> 47:46.775
Good for protein.

48:00.191 --> 48:03.285
How could we become Like this
in only eight years?

48:03.327 --> 48:06.990
This ship was built to outlast
our children’s children.

48:08.132 --> 48:11.966
I think we've been asleep
longer than you think.

48:40.331 --> 48:42.322
You want in?

48:42.366 --> 48:43.663
Come and get it, you fuck!

48:55.980 --> 48:59.040
Help!
Help me!

49:01.118 --> 49:02.813
Help!

49:14.865 --> 49:17.425
Who the hell are you?

49:17.468 --> 49:19.436
I'm part of the flight crew.

49:19.470 --> 49:21.836
Please help me.

49:21.872 --> 49:23.806
You're all right.
You're all right. Easy.

49:23.841 --> 49:26.776
Hey, hang on.

49:26.810 --> 49:28.835
Hang on.
Who are you?

49:28.879 --> 49:32.371
What's your name?
Can you hear me?

49:34.385 --> 49:36.615
Gallo.

49:36.654 --> 49:39.782
Gallo? Is that it?

49:39.823 --> 49:42.792
Corporal Gallo?

49:42.826 --> 49:46.057
Yes.

49:46.096 --> 49:47.723
Where'd you come from, Gallo?

49:47.765 --> 49:49.665
From the-

49:49.700 --> 49:51.725
from the bridge.

49:51.769 --> 49:55.136
Bridge?
What happened?

49:55.172 --> 49:57.800
Where are we?
Can you tell me?

49:57.841 --> 50:00.742
Corporal.

50:01.779 --> 50:05.306
Tell me.
What happened?

50:18.395 --> 50:19.987
Bowen:
Where are we?

50:20.030 --> 50:22.658
Hypersleep chamber,
personnel.

50:27.071 --> 50:29.198
Careful.

50:30.441 --> 50:32.534
And don't slow me down.

50:43.287 --> 50:45.221
Bower:
Most of these are empty.

50:45.255 --> 50:46.745
Where the hell is everyone?

50:46.790 --> 50:48.758
This is their main
hunting ground.

50:50.994 --> 50:52.621
Keep moving.

50:58.369 --> 51:01.964
Hey, my wife could be in here.

51:02.005 --> 51:05.133
She's a development settler?
Engineer?

51:06.643 --> 51:10.044
No, she's not part of the crew.
But spouses were brought with.

51:10.080 --> 51:11.479
She's not here then.

51:11.515 --> 51:14.040
Do you know where
the family members are?

51:14.084 --> 51:15.779
Quiet.

51:26.830 --> 51:28.661
We have to keep moving.

51:28.699 --> 51:31.930
We don't want to stay
in the open for too long.

51:31.969 --> 51:34.437
Especially in here.

51:41.211 --> 51:42.269
We have to get going.

51:48.419 --> 51:49.852
We can't just leave him.

51:49.887 --> 51:51.946
Fuck that.
He's hunting.

51:51.989 --> 51:54.253
You wait for him?
Good luck.

51:56.894 --> 51:58.657
Wait.

52:20.751 --> 52:22.981
You all right?

52:24.688 --> 52:26.679
I'm all right.

52:29.259 --> 52:31.352
Oh God.

52:37.167 --> 52:39.260
There must be hundreds
of them in here.

53:18.141 --> 53:20.302
Where did they go?

53:23.113 --> 53:24.603
We have to get out of here.

56:09.846 --> 56:11.837
We should run.

56:15.118 --> 56:17.450
Go!

57:05.068 --> 57:06.501
- What are you doing?
- We can't leave him.

57:23.520 --> 57:25.318
Bower, do you copy?

57:29.159 --> 57:30.592
You out there?

58:03.560 --> 58:06.222
Flight team 4.

58:06.263 --> 58:08.094
What are you doing?

58:08.131 --> 58:09.598
Just checking you.

58:09.633 --> 58:11.362
For what?

58:11.401 --> 58:13.961
Make sure you're okay.
You passed out.

58:14.004 --> 58:15.835
You were hysterical.

58:15.872 --> 58:19.171
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Payton.

58:19.209 --> 58:22.269
- Lieutenant Payton.
- You're a lieutenant?

58:22.312 --> 58:24.473
You're team 4.

58:24.514 --> 58:26.345
You're supposed
to be my predecessor.

58:28.685 --> 58:31.882
You said you came from the bridge.

58:31.922 --> 58:34.322
- Yeah, so?
- So where the hell are we?

58:34.357 --> 58:37.019
- I can't get any navigation in here.
- I don't know.

58:37.060 --> 58:39.654
Well, what did you see?
How did this whole thing get screwed up?

58:39.696 --> 58:43.223
Listen, I am not a navigator.

58:43.266 --> 58:46.064
- The stars all look alike.
- Take it easy, all right?

58:46.102 --> 58:48.832
Just want to make sure you're okay.

58:48.872 --> 58:51.238
- I'm fine.
- Is that your blood, Corporal?

58:53.877 --> 58:57.472
Some of it is, sir.

58:57.514 --> 59:00.244
Who else's blood is it?

59:00.283 --> 59:02.513
There was something
wrong with them.

59:02.552 --> 59:05.146
Something wrong with who?

59:05.188 --> 59:07.713
Your crew?

59:07.757 --> 59:10.351
It was pandorum.

59:10.393 --> 59:13.226
I had to defend myself.

59:13.263 --> 59:15.231
I did.

59:15.265 --> 59:18.530
Pandorum?
Both of 'em?

59:18.568 --> 59:21.264
You don't believe me, do you?

59:23.240 --> 59:26.300
If you would have seen them...

59:28.411 --> 59:32.282
you would have done
the same thing, sir.

59:41.925 --> 59:43.825
I thought you knew
where we were going.

59:43.860 --> 59:46.852
I was trying to save our asses.

01:00:30.974 --> 01:00:33.568
Whoa whoa, easy, okay?

01:00:33.610 --> 01:00:35.578
No weapons.
No weapons.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:40.847
Excuse me.
Just please, come.

01:00:40.884 --> 01:00:43.751
Come in.
Okay.

01:00:43.787 --> 01:00:47.314
Please, make yourselves at home.

01:00:48.725 --> 01:00:50.522
You live here?

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.858
- Who said that? What?
- You live here?

01:00:52.896 --> 01:00:56.263
I know it's not much to look at.

01:00:56.299 --> 01:00:58.733
But...

01:00:58.768 --> 01:01:00.599
they can't get in here

01:01:00.637 --> 01:01:02.298
unless I want them to.

01:01:02.339 --> 01:01:03.704
Why would you want them to?

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:06.140
I had no idea
there was any crew left.

01:01:06.176 --> 01:01:09.202
Have you met any other flyers?

01:01:09.245 --> 01:01:10.974
No.

01:01:12.515 --> 01:01:15.780
Not in a long long time.

01:01:15.819 --> 01:01:19.220
Why don't you come on
down so we can meet properly?

01:01:19.255 --> 01:01:22.224
You think I survived this long
trusting strangers?

01:01:22.258 --> 01:01:23.691
Wait.

01:01:26.229 --> 01:01:28.390
I have a question for you.
Where you got to be?

01:01:28.431 --> 01:01:31.662
Reactor bay.
Know how to get there?

01:01:31.701 --> 01:01:33.760
Yeah, I do.

01:01:35.238 --> 01:01:38.105
Why would you want
to go to the reactor?

01:01:38.141 --> 01:01:40.939
Oh, I get it.
I get it.

01:01:40.977 --> 01:01:44.435
You just woke up, huh?
You hungry?

01:01:44.481 --> 01:01:46.779
'Cause I can cook.

01:01:46.816 --> 01:01:49.580
I really got a treat for you guys.

01:01:49.619 --> 01:01:52.952
but I must admit it's really
difficult to season

01:01:52.989 --> 01:01:54.980
when you're only using
a motor oil base.

01:01:55.025 --> 01:01:58.085
But if we use our imagination,

01:01:58.128 --> 01:02:00.528
we got something here.

01:02:00.563 --> 01:02:02.531
It kinda tastes Like...

01:02:04.501 --> 01:02:06.560
herb and butter dogshit.

01:02:06.603 --> 01:02:08.798
How long have you been awake?

01:02:08.838 --> 01:02:11.136
Let me see- what's today?

01:02:11.174 --> 01:02:13.404
Tuesday, so I have no idea.

01:02:18.081 --> 01:02:21.608
Ah, well, let's eat, shall we?

01:02:21.651 --> 01:02:24.313
It's kosher.

01:02:24.354 --> 01:02:27.585
I'm a cook, you know.
Says so right here on my tattoo.

01:02:29.793 --> 01:02:31.454
Is that safe?

01:02:31.494 --> 01:02:33.462
Compared to what?

01:02:33.496 --> 01:02:35.862
Those things out there,

01:02:35.899 --> 01:02:38.527
could it have been something

01:02:38.568 --> 01:02:42.129
that crawled out of your tank or lab
or something?

01:02:42.172 --> 01:02:44.163
No, that's not possible.

01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:48.800
Then it's some kind of life form
that got onboard.

01:02:48.845 --> 01:02:50.506
Or something.

01:02:50.547 --> 01:02:52.606
Or something
that was already onboard

01:02:52.649 --> 01:02:54.844
with us in the hyperbunks.

01:02:54.884 --> 01:02:56.784
What do you mean?

01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:59.812
I believe it's the accelerator.

01:02:59.856 --> 01:03:02.916
The synthetic enzyme
in our feeding tubes

01:03:02.959 --> 01:03:05.052
that would help our bodies
adjust and adapt

01:03:05.095 --> 01:03:06.995
to the environmental
conditions on Tanis.

01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:09.828
From what I've seen,

01:03:09.866 --> 01:03:13.302
these things have adapted
to the ship instead.

01:03:15.004 --> 01:03:18.462
So you're saying that they're passengers
who have mutated?

01:03:18.508 --> 01:03:21.306
That stuff in our blood is supposed
to jump-start evolution.

01:03:21.344 --> 01:03:24.472
Well, why would they
be affected and we're not?

01:03:24.514 --> 01:03:27.540
Maybe they've been awake
much longer than we think.

01:03:27.584 --> 01:03:30.553
- Longer than him.
- Huh.

01:03:30.587 --> 01:03:32.555
- You don't know what happened to us?
- You do?

01:03:32.589 --> 01:03:36.047
Oh, I've been around
for a while.

01:03:36.092 --> 01:03:39.195
I know what I've seen.

01:03:47.837 --> 01:03:49.828
What do you think you're doing?

01:03:49.873 --> 01:03:51.534
What is that?

01:03:51.574 --> 01:03:54.338
It's just a sedative
to help you relax.

01:03:54.377 --> 01:03:57.005
Then you take it
and relax.

01:03:57.046 --> 01:04:00.709
Take it down a notch.
We're on the same team here.

01:04:02.252 --> 01:04:04.413
Do you know
the symptoms of pandorum?

01:04:04.454 --> 01:04:06.649
- What?
- Orbital dysfunctional syndrome.

01:04:06.689 --> 01:04:08.384
- Pandorum.
- I've seen it before.

01:04:08.424 --> 01:04:11.018
Ever witness
the symptoms firsthand?

01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:13.119
It's not something
you can easily detect.

01:04:13.163 --> 01:04:15.631
It starts with a shiver, an itch,

01:04:15.665 --> 01:04:17.496
a slow boil-

01:04:17.534 --> 01:04:20.594
the biological side effects
of flying deep space

01:04:20.637 --> 01:04:22.195
feeding into paranoia.

01:04:22.238 --> 01:04:24.763
And the paranoid
brain feeding the side effects.

01:04:24.807 --> 01:04:27.469
A downward spiral.
A descent into madness.

01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:30.843
There is no shutting off the heat
no matter what you do.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:33.474
It'll boil over.

01:04:33.516 --> 01:04:35.643
You don't believe me.

01:04:35.685 --> 01:04:38.051
I didn't say that.

01:04:38.087 --> 01:04:40.817
How could they both have had it?
The odds are insurmountable.

01:04:40.857 --> 01:04:42.722
I wasn't about
to question your actions.

01:04:42.759 --> 01:04:45.227
We all know pandorum
is greatly affected

01:04:45.261 --> 01:04:47.491
by any substantial
psychological trauma.

01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:50.363
- It has an emotional trigger effect.
- That's what they say.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:54.131
How do you think you would react
if you knew the truth?

01:04:57.507 --> 01:05:00.567
The truth about what?

01:05:00.610 --> 01:05:03.477
Leland: Boom.
Oh, how the whole world cheered

01:05:03.513 --> 01:05:06.539
to the thunder of earth's
mightiest creation-

01:05:06.583 --> 01:05:08.141
Elysium.

01:05:08.184 --> 01:05:10.448
One small spark

01:05:10.486 --> 01:05:13.387
to ignite the heavens
for the heroes

01:05:13.423 --> 01:05:15.687
to venture farther and farther

01:05:15.725 --> 01:05:18.421
than any of mankind's machines.

01:05:18.461 --> 01:05:21.430
And we slept.
We slept a slumber so deep

01:05:21.464 --> 01:05:23.227
that no one had dared before

01:05:23.266 --> 01:05:27.202
as three little Indians
were left to mind the store.

01:05:27.237 --> 01:05:28.761
Gallo:
We were only into our second term.

01:05:28.805 --> 01:05:30.033
All flight systems nominal.

01:05:30.073 --> 01:05:32.803
I picked up symptoms
with my CO and 2nd lieutenant.

01:05:32.842 --> 01:05:36.676
Mild symptoms. Nothing I thought
would become a problem.

01:05:36.713 --> 01:05:40.080
- Until we got the transmission.
- What transmission?

01:05:40.116 --> 01:05:42.607
Leland:
Mother Earth's final call.

01:05:42.652 --> 01:05:46.816
All God's creation ending
with mere words of encouragement.

01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:56.755
What does it say?

01:06:08.544 --> 01:06:11.104
You're all that's left of us.

01:06:13.049 --> 01:06:16.507
Good luck.
God bless.

01:06:16.552 --> 01:06:19.146
And Godspeed.

01:06:20.189 --> 01:06:21.554
Earth...

01:06:24.494 --> 01:06:26.155
is gone?

01:06:26.195 --> 01:06:28.322
Poof.
Wiped away.

01:06:28.364 --> 01:06:31.231
We ran a full sweep of the grid
and they were gone.

01:06:31.267 --> 01:06:34.065
One day there,
the next nothing.

01:06:34.103 --> 01:06:36.264
In one day?

01:06:36.306 --> 01:06:38.934
It had to be nuclear
or an asteroid.

01:06:38.975 --> 01:06:40.465
Does it matter?

01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:42.944
My fellow crew members
didn't take the news too well.

01:06:42.979 --> 01:06:46.005
I wanted to wake the primary crew,

01:06:46.049 --> 01:06:48.574
but my 2nd lieutenant
was already over the edge.

01:06:48.618 --> 01:06:52.019
Leland: Three little Indians
with the burden to bear.

01:06:52.055 --> 01:06:54.421
No more law.
Nothing left to care.

01:06:54.457 --> 01:06:58.052
Just three little souls whose
destiny had become undone

01:06:58.094 --> 01:07:02.121
because there was
chop chop chop chop...

01:07:03.266 --> 01:07:05.496
then there was only one.

01:07:05.535 --> 01:07:08.060
One little Indian left.

01:07:08.104 --> 01:07:10.038
They were my commanding officers,

01:07:10.073 --> 01:07:12.371
men who had guided me
through FT.

01:07:12.408 --> 01:07:15.536
But it wasn't them anymore.
They were gone.

01:07:15.578 --> 01:07:18.445
- I had no choice!
- Corporal Gallo!

01:07:18.481 --> 01:07:22.212
Leland: One little Indian left,
alone with all his doom.

01:07:22.251 --> 01:07:25.049
He refuses to go to bed,
so what does he do?

01:07:25.088 --> 01:07:29.024
He decides to stay up
and play in his room.

01:07:29.058 --> 01:07:31.652
What nasty little games
he would play

01:07:31.694 --> 01:07:33.628
with his slumbering prey.

01:07:33.663 --> 01:07:36.029
He was slayer, he was master.

01:07:36.065 --> 01:07:38.932
He was both God and the devil.

01:07:38.968 --> 01:07:41.903
See, that's what some would say.
He would grow to manhood,

01:07:41.938 --> 01:07:43.963
a self-proclaimed king.

01:07:44.006 --> 01:07:47.669
Master of his own vessel.
Home to his own sin.

01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:50.611
He just cast out
all who had behaved.

01:07:50.646 --> 01:07:54.082
Just exiled to the cargo hold

01:07:54.117 --> 01:07:55.914
to fend amongst themselves...

01:07:55.952 --> 01:08:00.286
...and scavenge,
feeding off their own.

01:08:00.323 --> 01:08:02.587
Evil grew.

01:08:02.625 --> 01:08:06.083
The king no longer wanted to play.

01:08:06.129 --> 01:08:09.621
So he returned
to his bed of slumber.

01:08:09.665 --> 01:08:12.225
And while the king slept,

01:08:12.268 --> 01:08:15.260
a whole new world of evil grew

01:08:15.304 --> 01:08:17.033
as we wept.

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:20.769
Gallo's voice:
It starts with a shiver, an itch.

01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:22.937
We all know pandorum
is greatly affected

01:08:22.979 --> 01:08:25.243
by any substantial
psychological trauma.

01:08:25.281 --> 01:08:27.442
It has an emotional trigger effect.

01:09:09.358 --> 01:09:10.450
What are you doing?

01:09:14.529 --> 01:09:16.464
He's gonna fucking eat us.

01:09:16.499 --> 01:09:18.763
It's not personal, guys.

01:09:18.801 --> 01:09:22.532
It's just survival of the fittest.

01:09:22.572 --> 01:09:26.372
Or maybe it's the brightest.

01:09:26.408 --> 01:09:28.569
You understand what I'm saying?

01:09:29.612 --> 01:09:31.671
- You gassed us.
- Oh, yes.

01:09:31.714 --> 01:09:33.477
And I'm sorry,
but I'm a little too old

01:09:33.515 --> 01:09:36.041
and too tired for the honorable way
of hunting game.

01:09:36.085 --> 01:09:39.680
You better make sure I'm dead...

01:09:42.892 --> 01:09:46.089
You don't have to do this.
We have to save the ship.

01:09:46.127 --> 01:09:49.859
Don't sweat it
and save me the speeches.

01:09:49.899 --> 01:09:52.697
I wouldn't have survived this long
if I had a heart.

01:09:54.136 --> 01:09:57.833
You know, a strange thing,
the survival instinct.

01:09:57.874 --> 01:10:01.674
I mean, there's nothing really left
to live for.

01:10:01.711 --> 01:10:05.272
Don't be fucking stupid.
I can save the fucking ship.

01:10:09.051 --> 01:10:12.919
Question is,
what would be more stupid?

01:10:12.955 --> 01:10:15.446
Trusting the ship will hold
to see another day

01:10:15.491 --> 01:10:18.790
when it's kept me alive
for all these years?

01:10:18.828 --> 01:10:20.955
Or trusting somebody

01:10:20.997 --> 01:10:23.124
who's desperate enough
to say anything

01:10:23.165 --> 01:10:26.396
just when I'm about to carve
a steak out of his girlfriend?

01:10:28.037 --> 01:10:30.028
Listen to the ship.

01:10:30.072 --> 01:10:31.869
What about the ship?

01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:35.741
The power surges-

01:10:35.778 --> 01:10:38.872
the reactor is in its final stage.

01:10:38.915 --> 01:10:42.043
We have less time than I thought.

01:10:42.084 --> 01:10:46.020
The final phase before shutdown,

01:10:46.055 --> 01:10:48.421
before we lose everything

01:10:48.457 --> 01:10:50.891
and everyone onboard.

01:10:50.927 --> 01:10:54.829
If we don't reset it now,

01:10:54.864 --> 01:10:58.095
everything is lost.

01:10:58.134 --> 01:11:02.400
She has been all moody lately.

01:11:02.438 --> 01:11:04.963
Very moody.

01:11:05.007 --> 01:11:07.703
Hey, listen.

01:11:07.743 --> 01:11:10.234
Hey, I get it.

01:11:10.279 --> 01:11:13.840
What? You get what?

01:11:13.883 --> 01:11:17.080
You did what you had to do.

01:11:17.119 --> 01:11:20.782
You made it.
No one's gonna judge you.

01:11:20.823 --> 01:11:23.348
No one's gonna judge you.

01:11:23.392 --> 01:11:25.860
You are a survivor.

01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:30.697
And right now we...

01:11:30.733 --> 01:11:33.600
have to reset the reactor.

01:11:38.574 --> 01:11:42.510
How long before the ship dies?

01:11:42.545 --> 01:11:44.240
The truth.

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:46.942
I don't know.

01:11:46.983 --> 01:11:49.747
Take a fucking guess.

01:11:51.354 --> 01:11:54.187
An hour. Less.

01:12:06.102 --> 01:12:08.570
- Well?
- We're in this together.

01:12:08.604 --> 01:12:10.902
I need your radio.
We don't have much time.

01:12:17.113 --> 01:12:19.172
Bower:
Payton, do you copy?

01:12:19.215 --> 01:12:20.807
Do you copy?
Can you hear me?

01:12:20.850 --> 01:12:23.978
Payton, do you copy?
Can you hear me?

01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:26.215
I'm here.
Where are you?

01:12:26.255 --> 01:12:29.019
Storage tank
somewhere below B level.

01:12:29.058 --> 01:12:31.583
Midship sector 12, I think.

01:12:31.627 --> 01:12:34.221
How the hell did you get all the way
to the other side of the ship?

01:12:34.263 --> 01:12:36.254
The reactor is shutting down fast.

01:12:36.298 --> 01:12:39.290
I need you to access the memory banks
from the last power surge

01:12:39.335 --> 01:12:42.566
- and run a Kolzer complex test.
- Accessing memory banks now.

01:12:42.605 --> 01:12:44.664
Running Kolzer complex.

01:12:51.013 --> 01:12:52.878
You're not gonna Like this.

01:12:52.915 --> 01:12:55.179
Test says you have
less than 47 minutes

01:12:55.217 --> 01:12:57.344
before complete system failure.

01:12:57.386 --> 01:13:00.014
- That's not much time.
- How do we get you in there?

01:13:00.056 --> 01:13:02.456
- I need you to give us a path.
- Copy.

01:13:05.561 --> 01:13:07.688
Move it.

01:13:33.689 --> 01:13:35.623
No. It's a child.

01:13:35.658 --> 01:13:38.149
Child?
That's no fucking child.

01:13:45.668 --> 01:13:47.295
They are breeding.

01:13:47.336 --> 01:13:49.600
Little bastard.
He went and got daddy.

01:14:02.284 --> 01:14:04.582
This is not gonna work.
There's too many of them.

01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:07.145
We must be close
to where they live.

01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:09.919
Great.
Now we're fucking stuck here.

01:14:12.728 --> 01:14:14.855
Gallo: What's so important
on the other side of that door?

01:14:14.897 --> 01:14:17.388
The bridge.
We can take control of guidance

01:14:17.433 --> 01:14:18.832
as soon as we get on the bridge.

01:14:18.868 --> 01:14:21.428
How's that going to help?
This ship is dying.

01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:23.995
We should be focusing
on how to save ourselves.

01:14:24.039 --> 01:14:27.133
Oh, that's right.
The Boy Scout is going to save us.

01:14:27.176 --> 01:14:29.076
He can do it.

01:14:30.746 --> 01:14:33.943
24 hours ago
he didn't know his own name.

01:14:33.983 --> 01:14:36.850
Now you think he's ready
to reconfigure

01:14:36.886 --> 01:14:39.218
a nuclear reactor?

01:14:39.255 --> 01:14:41.416
Leland:
If they don't leave soon,

01:14:41.457 --> 01:14:43.516
there's no point in even going.

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.591
What are you doing?

01:14:46.629 --> 01:14:49.223
These are our families

01:14:49.265 --> 01:14:51.733
from flight personnel.

01:14:51.767 --> 01:14:54.964
They're all dead.

01:14:56.105 --> 01:14:58.232
You think she's here?

01:14:58.274 --> 01:15:00.742
No, she's-

01:15:00.776 --> 01:15:02.573
she's not here.

01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:06.171
How do you know for sure?

01:15:06.215 --> 01:15:08.479
'Cause she wouldn't come with me.

01:15:17.726 --> 01:15:20.752
She's not on this flight.

01:15:20.796 --> 01:15:22.821
She left me.

01:15:39.315 --> 01:15:41.408
There was nothing left for me,

01:15:41.450 --> 01:15:43.384
so I enlisted.

01:15:43.419 --> 01:15:46.354
She's the reason why I left.

01:15:47.857 --> 01:15:51.293
Well, then she saved your life.

01:15:51.327 --> 01:15:53.818
That's very tragic.

01:15:53.863 --> 01:15:56.798
But we've got to move on.
I'm sick of this shit.

01:15:56.832 --> 01:15:58.129
- For what?
- What?

01:15:58.167 --> 01:15:59.964
- For what?
- Shh.

01:16:00.002 --> 01:16:02.027
- They're all gone.
- Shh.

01:16:02.071 --> 01:16:05.507
- There's nothing left.
- Shh! Shut your fucking mouth.

01:16:05.541 --> 01:16:07.805
There's nothing left to go back to.

01:16:07.843 --> 01:16:10.243
You're wrong.

01:16:10.279 --> 01:16:13.214
Hey, we were meant to go on.

01:16:14.783 --> 01:16:17.980
And we were meant to survive.

01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:20.045
And now it's more
important than ever.

01:16:20.089 --> 01:16:22.080
Leland:
We're wasting time.

01:16:22.124 --> 01:16:24.649
- I remember.
- What?

01:16:26.662 --> 01:16:28.926
Clock's ticking.

01:16:33.002 --> 01:16:35.971
Payton's wife Marianne.

01:16:42.945 --> 01:16:44.640
I remember.

01:16:47.016 --> 01:16:49.917
Bower was right about one thing:

01:16:49.952 --> 01:16:52.284
Once this thing shuts down
we are as good as dead.

01:16:52.321 --> 01:16:54.482
What are you muttering about?

01:16:54.523 --> 01:16:57.959
I'm saying once it's done
we're done.

01:16:57.993 --> 01:17:00.325
But we still have a way out of this.

01:17:00.362 --> 01:17:03.525
You're suggesting what, Corporal?

01:17:03.565 --> 01:17:05.726
We can launch ourselves in the pods

01:17:05.768 --> 01:17:09.169
before the ignition systems
are completely dead, sir.

01:17:09.204 --> 01:17:11.297
That's suicide.

01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:12.739
We can buy a few days,

01:17:12.775 --> 01:17:14.766
which is better
than what we have left here.

01:17:18.747 --> 01:17:21.045
Leland:
The reactor is close.

01:17:21.083 --> 01:17:22.550
You can hear it breathe.

01:17:37.199 --> 01:17:38.860
Yeah, this is it...

01:17:40.102 --> 01:17:43.196
a descent into hell itself.

01:17:56.318 --> 01:17:59.082
How long do you think that reactor
has been sitting there, huh?

01:17:59.121 --> 01:18:01.646
That thing could melt down

01:18:01.690 --> 01:18:03.351
when he tries to fire the core.

01:18:05.194 --> 01:18:07.424
This ship could be ripped in half.

01:18:07.463 --> 01:18:10.830
Stand down, Corporal.
We are not abandoning anything

01:18:10.866 --> 01:18:13.061
and we are not leaving them behind.

01:18:13.102 --> 01:18:15.969
We can't stay on this ship!
You know that!

01:18:16.005 --> 01:18:18.872
I said stand down, Corporal!

01:18:20.342 --> 01:18:22.003
That's an order.

01:18:43.799 --> 01:18:45.858
Whoa!

01:18:51.607 --> 01:18:52.835
Christ Almighty.

01:19:24.173 --> 01:19:25.697
Don't let go.

01:20:03.345 --> 01:20:04.835
He's in.

01:20:05.848 --> 01:20:07.713
We're gonna get ourselves
out of this.

01:20:07.749 --> 01:20:09.376
- Trust me.
- Trust you?

01:20:09.418 --> 01:20:12.444
How can I trust someone who
isn't even honest with himself?

01:20:12.488 --> 01:20:15.048
We still have time.

01:20:15.090 --> 01:20:17.991
- You have to listen to me.
- Don't do that.

01:20:18.026 --> 01:20:19.721
Don't do what?

01:20:19.761 --> 01:20:23.094
Don't talk to me Like I'm some child
that needs reassurance.

01:20:23.132 --> 01:20:24.724
Then calm the fuck down.

01:20:24.766 --> 01:20:27.792
I know this ship and I know what
she's capable of better than anyone.

01:20:27.836 --> 01:20:31.397
I know what she can and can't do.
Why are we even arguing?

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.670
If you want to stay here
to die that is your choice.

01:20:33.709 --> 01:20:37.008
- I gave you an order.
- Not mine. Not mine!

01:20:37.045 --> 01:20:38.512
Corporal.

01:20:38.547 --> 01:20:40.515
Who's the one being
irrational here, Lieutenant?

01:20:40.549 --> 01:20:42.642
Who's the one being delusional?

01:20:42.684 --> 01:20:45.482
I'm getting off this ship.
The flight is over.

01:20:45.521 --> 01:20:46.852
Over!

01:21:47.616 --> 01:21:50.278
- Don't shoot yourself into space.
- Shut up.

01:21:50.319 --> 01:21:53.049
- I'm getting off this ship.
- Bower's going to reboot the reactor.

01:21:53.088 --> 01:21:54.783
Shut up.

01:21:56.158 --> 01:21:58.683
It wasn't the crew
that was sick, was it?

01:21:58.727 --> 01:22:00.752
- Finish the code.
- Look at yourself.

01:22:00.796 --> 01:22:03.663
- You're the one with the symptoms.
- Finish it!

01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:20.371
What are you doing?

01:22:20.415 --> 01:22:22.349
It's for your own good.

01:22:22.384 --> 01:22:24.648
What the fuck are you doing?

01:22:24.686 --> 01:22:26.620
You're not well.

01:22:26.655 --> 01:22:29.180
You just need the proper treatment.

01:22:31.593 --> 01:22:34.426
Let me out, God damn it!

01:22:34.463 --> 01:22:37.955
Open it!
That is an order, motherfucker!

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.992
It's not your fault.

01:22:41.036 --> 01:22:44.528
I will cut you to fucking bits.
Open it!

01:22:44.573 --> 01:22:46.404
Open it!
I will carve you up!

01:22:46.441 --> 01:22:48.841
Your mind has turned
against itself.

01:22:48.877 --> 01:22:51.311
You're killing us!

01:22:51.346 --> 01:22:53.644
We are all going to die, Corporal.

01:23:04.593 --> 01:23:06.652
Holy fuck.

01:23:51.206 --> 01:23:54.141
Oh, shit.

01:24:52.334 --> 01:24:53.494
They're coming.

01:25:01.943 --> 01:25:03.570
Hurry up!

01:25:03.612 --> 01:25:04.840
Shit.

01:25:09.418 --> 01:25:11.579
Come on, come on, come on.

01:25:39.748 --> 01:25:43.445
He did it.
Boy Scout did it.

01:25:43.485 --> 01:25:46.420
You were right.
Now let me out.

01:25:46.455 --> 01:25:48.821
I can help.

01:25:48.857 --> 01:25:50.848
I'll help you.

01:25:54.162 --> 01:25:56.289
What are you doing?

01:25:56.331 --> 01:25:58.458
Are you still trying
to get on the bridge?

01:25:59.668 --> 01:26:01.795
You do not want
to go in there, Corporal.

01:26:04.506 --> 01:26:06.406
What are you gonna tell them, huh?

01:26:06.441 --> 01:26:09.410
- Bower will be coming back here.
- Shut up.

01:26:09.444 --> 01:26:11.309
They'll know what you did.

01:27:12.107 --> 01:27:13.506
Where do you think you're going?

01:27:13.542 --> 01:27:15.169
Quiet.

01:27:15.210 --> 01:27:17.542
Think about what you're doing, sir.

01:27:18.713 --> 01:27:21.546
Shut the fuck up.

01:27:23.285 --> 01:27:25.310
They will never let you
get away with this.

01:27:25.353 --> 01:27:26.615
Shut up!

01:27:43.104 --> 01:27:45.436
They're everywhere.

01:28:08.897 --> 01:28:10.159
Asshole!

01:29:11.292 --> 01:29:13.726
We both know who needs this shot.

01:29:13.762 --> 01:29:17.027
- Stay back.
- Who's the one suffering here, sir?

01:29:17.065 --> 01:29:18.498
I mean it!

01:29:20.402 --> 01:29:22.893
What do you want from me?

01:29:24.739 --> 01:29:27.537
Your mind has turned against itself.

01:29:30.779 --> 01:29:33.179
I'm gonna fucking carve you up.

01:29:46.761 --> 01:29:48.752
Who are you?

01:29:59.874 --> 01:30:02.570
Leland:
Ahem. Made it.

01:30:02.610 --> 01:30:05.875
Whoo.

01:30:05.914 --> 01:30:07.745
I was with your boy.

01:30:07.782 --> 01:30:11.274
I helped him get all this started.

01:30:11.319 --> 01:30:13.014
I see you're a flyer too.

01:30:39.481 --> 01:30:41.039
Ah.

01:30:59.367 --> 01:31:01.699
Where's your lieutenant?

01:31:01.736 --> 01:31:03.795
He's not my lieutenant.

01:31:16.851 --> 01:31:19.684
Where are we?

01:31:19.721 --> 01:31:21.313
What's happened to us?

01:31:21.356 --> 01:31:23.916
The flight log

01:31:23.958 --> 01:31:27.052
will tell us how long we've been out
and how far we've gone.

01:31:42.043 --> 01:31:44.238
It seems

01:31:44.279 --> 01:31:47.407
my mild memory lapse

01:31:47.448 --> 01:31:49.541
has finally worn off, Lieutenant.

01:31:49.584 --> 01:31:51.609
Who the hell are you?

01:31:51.653 --> 01:31:54.952
Gallo, Corporal.

01:31:54.989 --> 01:31:57.480
I was younger than you
when I first came onboard.

01:31:57.525 --> 01:32:01.461
Funny, I can't even remember what life
was Like before this flight began.

01:32:01.496 --> 01:32:03.361
It's all I have.

01:32:04.866 --> 01:32:07.061
You're the one who received
the final transmission.

01:32:07.101 --> 01:32:08.796
You stayed awake.
You broke the rotation.

01:32:08.837 --> 01:32:10.998
You killed your crew.

01:32:11.039 --> 01:32:14.167
How the hell would you know that?

01:32:14.209 --> 01:32:16.177
Where are we?

01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:21.273
Go ahead, take a peek.

01:32:29.424 --> 01:32:31.221
You tell me.

01:32:36.631 --> 01:32:38.758
What have you done with us?

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:40.597
You don't get it, kid.

01:32:40.635 --> 01:32:42.865
There's no one left to judge.

01:32:42.904 --> 01:32:46.465
Where are the stars?
Oh my God.

01:32:46.507 --> 01:32:48.907
God?
You think God survived?

01:32:48.943 --> 01:32:51.434
He's dead along with
the rest of humanity.

01:32:51.479 --> 01:32:53.344
There's no law or order,

01:32:53.381 --> 01:32:55.076
no good or evil.
Just us.

01:32:55.116 --> 01:32:58.608
And you think you're going
to be the one to judge me?

01:32:58.653 --> 01:32:59.915
You want to take a shot at me?

01:32:59.954 --> 01:33:01.615
You know what?
I just might.

01:33:01.656 --> 01:33:03.089
You are suffering, son.

01:33:03.124 --> 01:33:06.685
I can see it in your face.
I've been there.

01:33:06.728 --> 01:33:09.288
Just imagine just for a minute,

01:33:09.330 --> 01:33:12.390
imagine yourself without the chains
of your morality.

01:33:12.433 --> 01:33:14.367
You'd even surprise yourself.

01:33:14.402 --> 01:33:16.233
It's the ultimate freedom.

01:33:16.271 --> 01:33:18.205
No.

01:33:18.239 --> 01:33:20.366
This isn't freedom.

01:33:20.408 --> 01:33:22.399
This is pandorum.

01:33:22.443 --> 01:33:26.243
Oh, pandorum. Pandorum isn't
what they warned us about.

01:33:26.281 --> 01:33:28.306
I know it's frightening at first,
terrifying in fact.

01:33:28.349 --> 01:33:31.147
Isn't that what you're feeling right now,
terrible fear?

01:33:31.185 --> 01:33:34.780
Let go and on the other side
of it is divine clarity.

01:33:34.822 --> 01:33:36.483
Purity.
Enlightenment.

01:33:36.524 --> 01:33:38.492
Shut up!
What's out there?

01:33:38.526 --> 01:33:41.154
You are resisting what is.

01:33:41.195 --> 01:33:44.096
You have to let go of
your petty concept of reality.

01:33:44.132 --> 01:33:46.293
That's just baggage
from the old world.

01:33:46.334 --> 01:33:49.030
And we both know that didn't work
out very well now, did it?

01:33:49.070 --> 01:33:52.972
They fucked up our planet.
Life eats life.

01:33:53.007 --> 01:33:56.238
And all that's left is what is.

01:33:56.277 --> 01:33:58.336
This ship is a seed

01:33:58.379 --> 01:34:00.939
from which we can create a new world.

01:34:00.982 --> 01:34:02.142
Shut up!
What's out there?!

01:34:02.183 --> 01:34:03.946
A new world.
A natural state.

01:34:03.985 --> 01:34:06.180
- Raw, beautiful...
- What do you see?

01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:09.417
...perfect.
I am offering you the kingdom.

01:34:09.457 --> 01:34:12.085
And all that's holding you back

01:34:12.126 --> 01:34:13.787
is your own fear.

01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:17.964
Still the Boy Scout,
hey, kid?

01:34:17.999 --> 01:34:20.559
There will always be law

01:34:20.601 --> 01:34:23.195
and you will pay
for what you've done.

01:34:23.237 --> 01:34:26.968
Even if that means I have
to pull the sick out of you.

01:34:29.877 --> 01:34:31.708
- Bower!
- What is it?

01:34:53.835 --> 01:34:55.860
We've already crashed.

01:34:55.903 --> 01:34:59.566
We've been on Tanis
all this time.

01:35:01.042 --> 01:35:03.067
All this time.

01:35:07.048 --> 01:35:09.778
I guess this thing
does land itself.

01:35:09.817 --> 01:35:11.785
Doesn't float too well though,
does it?

01:35:16.724 --> 01:35:18.419
Let go of your fear.

01:35:19.627 --> 01:35:22.255
This is where I'll push through.

01:35:25.767 --> 01:35:28.258
Shh shh.

01:35:28.302 --> 01:35:30.202
They're coming in.

01:35:35.376 --> 01:35:36.570
Attaboy.

01:36:18.186 --> 01:36:20.450
They're coming in.

01:36:20.488 --> 01:36:23.218
What are you doing?

01:36:32.033 --> 01:36:33.625
Why don't you shoot?

01:37:31.025 --> 01:37:32.686
Are you crazy?

01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:42.063
- Do you see that?
- Fuck him.

01:37:42.103 --> 01:37:44.128
- We need to get out of here.
- Hold on.

01:37:44.172 --> 01:37:47.232
Not Like this.
We can't die Like this.

01:37:47.275 --> 01:37:48.708
Hold on.

01:38:24.478 --> 01:38:27.242
What?
No, I can't-

01:38:27.281 --> 01:38:29.010
Just breathe.

01:39:34.048 --> 01:39:36.380
Hey. Hey.

01:39:42.957 --> 01:39:44.447
Just breathe.

01:39:47.228 --> 01:39:49.389
It's safe to wake up now.
