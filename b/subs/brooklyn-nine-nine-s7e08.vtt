00:04.839 --> 00:06.590
to come with me right now.

00:06.632 --> 00:08.175
Can I eat my bagel?

00:13.889 --> 00:16.558
This was in his trunk.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.936

Why am I here?

00:21.563 --> 00:23.774
I didn't do anything.

00:23.816 --> 00:25.526
You broke into

00:23.816 --> 00:25.526
15 houses, Shane,

00:25.567 --> 00:27.486
but that's not what

00:25.567 --> 00:27.486
I care about right now.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.112
All I care about is what

00:29.154 --> 00:30.865
-I don't understand.

Now tell me, Shane,

00:41.959 --> 00:43.794
when did you get the invite?

00:43.836 --> 00:46.338
-What?

00:43.836 --> 00:46.338
-When did you receive

00:43.836 --> 00:46.338
the invite in the mail

00:46.380 --> 00:47.756
and how come I didn't get one?

00:47.798 --> 00:49.257
Why would you get an invite?

00:47.798 --> 00:49.257
Do you know Doug?

00:49.299 --> 00:51.468

00:51.510 --> 00:53.428
Calm down, Jake.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.428
Maybe it's a small wedding.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.431
Okay, good point.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.431
How big is the venue, Shane?

00:56.473 --> 00:57.933

-Wash?

01:06.817 --> 01:08.360
-I meant scratch.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.029
You know I meant scratch.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.029
Now tell me the password.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.530
I think it's

01:10.070 --> 01:11.530
"dougandkateforever."

There, was that

01:11.572 --> 01:14.033
so hard, Shane?

01:14.074 --> 01:15.450
You did the right thing.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.037
Now get this piece

01:15.492 --> 01:18.037

01:52.654 --> 01:53.906
I find a hand-painted mug

01:53.948 --> 01:56.491

01:56.533 --> 01:58.744
So, what's going on?

Anything exciting in your life

that you maybe want

01:58.786 --> 02:00.287
to tell me about?

02:00.328 --> 02:02.205
I got a new job.

when they have

02:02.247 --> 02:03.874
to testify before Congress,

02:03.916 --> 02:05.375
so they don't look so racist.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.628
Every 15 minutes I just

02:05.417 --> 02:07.628
whisper some nonsense at 'em.

02:07.669 --> 02:11.256
[whispers] The texture

02:07.669 --> 02:11.256

02:11.298 --> 02:14.468

02:11.298 --> 02:14.468
for that nonsense.

02:14.509 --> 02:17.763
That's cool, congratulations.

maybe even more interesting

02:19.180 --> 02:20.724
that you want to fill me in on?

It seemed like

say he was a narc?

10:38.638 --> 10:40.140
-Is he a cop?

10:38.638 --> 10:40.140
-He's not a cop.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.225
He caught me

10:40.181 --> 10:42.225
cheating on my boyfriend

10:40.181 --> 10:42.225

10:46.938 --> 10:48.607
And we're paranoid

10:46.938 --> 10:48.607

10:48.648 --> 10:50.233
that cop friend in the NYPD.

right, guys?

11:29.314 --> 11:31.274
I knew it was

11:29.314 --> 11:31.274
a mistake to invite a cop.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.817
That's why you

11:31.316 --> 11:32.817
should only interact

11:32.859 --> 11:34.110
with people who

11:32.859 --> 11:34.110
are exactly the same as you.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.278
That's a terrible lesson.

They confessed

11:54.422 --> 11:55.590
disappear with the diamonds.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.022
Does the Russian know

12:09.312 --> 12:11.022
his diamonds are missing?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.440
No, we swapped

12:11.064 --> 12:12.440
them for fakes.

12:12.482 --> 12:13.858
Perfect, that means

12:12.482 --> 12:13.858

12:13.900 --> 12:15.402
-No harm, no foul.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.402
-Okay, wait.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.195

12:15.443 --> 12:17.195
the premise and I think

12:17.237 --> 12:19.573
a reverse heist would make

12:17.237 --> 12:19.573
for a great movie and I already

12:19.614 --> 12:21.700

12:19.614 --> 12:21.700

12:23.577 --> 12:25.036

12:25.078 --> 12:26.829
But no, I'm not onboard

12:25.078 --> 12:26.829

12:26.871 --> 12:28.623
And a cop's job

12:26.871 --> 12:28.623
is to prevent crime,

13:07.954 --> 13:10.873

Can I ask why that

13:16.296 --> 13:18.632
card is so important?

13:18.673 --> 13:20.634
Because of Zeff Wilcox.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.843

13:22.885 --> 13:24.638
-That's nice.

13:24.679 --> 13:25.972
And the words

13:24.679 --> 13:25.972
he wrote on the back.

13:26.013 --> 13:28.224
The back--

13:26.013 --> 13:28.224
Say what, now?

13:28.266 --> 13:29.559
Why is this blank?

13:29.601 --> 13:32.811

13:32.853 --> 13:34.689

13:34.731 --> 13:36.983
I didn't help Zeff,

13:34.731 --> 13:36.983
I failed Zeff.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.485
His case was never solved.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.320
The words written

13:38.526 --> 13:40.320
on the back were:

13:40.361 --> 13:41.820
"Thanks for nothing."

13:41.862 --> 13:43.364
Oh, man, that's rough.

13:43.406 --> 13:45.908
I have held onto

13:43.406 --> 13:45.908
that card for 30 years

13:45.950 --> 13:47.744
because I always wanted

13:45.950 --> 13:47.744
to remember what it felt like

13:47.786 --> 13:49.746
to let someone down,

13:47.786 --> 13:49.746

14:09.932 --> 14:11.184

That's the point, Georgina.

14:57.188 --> 14:58.648
He says that's the point,

14:57.188 --> 14:58.648
Georgina.

14:58.690 --> 14:59.858
This is taking too long.

14:58.690 --> 14:59.858
Make a video.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.818
Tell your

14:59.899 --> 15:01.818
25<i> million</i> subscribers

15:01.860 --> 15:04.111
to never stay

15:01.860 --> 15:04.111
at this crap hotel.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.446
No, no, no.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.446
I'll take care of it.

15:05.488 --> 15:07.741
Let me talk

15:05.488 --> 15:07.741
to my general manager.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.409
-[softly]  You better run.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.409
-Matt, don't yell.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.745
You'll strain

15:09.450 --> 15:11.745
your beautiful voice.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.580
[Jake]<i> Once we hack</i>

15:11.786 --> 15:13.580
<i>into the computer</i>

15:13.621 --> 15:15.081
<i>and get the override code,</i>

15:15.122 --> 15:16.666

15:18.668 --> 15:19.919
I got it myself.

[Jake]<i> Then, after the Russian</i>

<i>goes out for the night,</i>

15:31.931 --> 15:33.933
[Jake]<i> Trudy will then exit,</i>

15:31.931 --> 15:33.933
<i>leaving me behind in the suite</i>

[hip-hop music]

15:49.657 --> 15:51.117
Trudy Judy...

15:51.158 --> 15:53.994
It's exactly 14,

15:51.158 --> 15:53.994
just like you promised!

15:54.036 --> 15:55.121
You did promise her butts.

15:55.162 --> 15:56.581
-I know.

15:55.162 --> 15:56.581
-Yeah.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.125
[Scully] Mmm. The smell

15:56.623 --> 15:59.125
of fresh-cooked pizza.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.794
Where are we?

15:59.166 --> 16:00.794
Rome, Italy?

16:00.835 --> 16:03.254
Guys, you got

16:00.835 --> 16:03.254
the vending machine you wanted.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.131
You can stop with

16:03.296 --> 16:05.131
the playacting.

16:05.172 --> 16:06.424
[Charles]

16:05.172 --> 16:06.424
I don't think

16:05.172 --> 16:06.424
that's scripted.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.175
That's just them

16:06.466 --> 16:08.175
talking about pizza.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.177
[Scully]

16:08.217 --> 16:10.177
Yum, yum, yum.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.680
[Charles]

16:10.219 --> 16:12.680
Man, I shouldn't have pushed

16:10.219 --> 16:12.680
for the fish ball machine.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.432
I should've just played it safe

16:14.474 --> 16:15.934
and gone for

16:14.474 --> 16:15.934
the fish cake machine.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.144
So you don't think

16:15.975 --> 16:18.144
the fish part was the problem?

16:18.185 --> 16:20.605
-I don't.

16:18.185 --> 16:20.605
-Well, at least they're happy.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.106
Look at 'em.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.066
[Hitchcock, Scully screaming]

16:24.108 --> 16:26.026
[Hitchcock]

16:24.108 --> 16:26.026
My pizza!

16:26.068 --> 16:27.278
[Trudy]

16:26.068 --> 16:27.278
Ooh! You did it, Peralta.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.863
You pulled off

16:27.320 --> 16:28.863
the reverse heist.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.824
This whole time

16:28.905 --> 16:30.824
I thought you were<i> a</i> bitch...

16:30.865 --> 16:33.743
but truth is,

16:30.865 --> 16:33.743
you're actually<i> that</i> bitch!

16:33.785 --> 16:35.035
-He is, isn't he?

16:33.785 --> 16:35.035
-Hm-mm.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.871
He is that bitch.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.164
-I don't know if I want

16:36.913 --> 16:38.164
that nickname to stick.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.164
-[knocking]

16:38.205 --> 16:40.040
Ooh, I hope

16:38.205 --> 16:40.040
my butts are back.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.752
[Doug] I do not like how butts

16:40.082 --> 16:42.752
have become your thing, Trudy.

16:42.794 --> 16:45.045
-You used to love horses.

16:42.794 --> 16:45.045
-Horses have butts.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.674
Guys, it's not butts.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.674
I'm so sorry, Doug.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.049
Miami PD!

16:49.091 --> 16:50.677
It's just those

16:49.091 --> 16:50.677
three back there.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.428
-[Miami cop] Hand on the table!

16:50.718 --> 16:52.428
-Jake, what the hell?!

16:52.470 --> 16:55.431
Cops always be coppin'.

16:52.470 --> 16:55.431
Heh.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.769
Hey!

16:58.017 --> 16:59.769
Hey there, friends.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.312
I tried to flag down your taxi

17:01.354 --> 17:03.230
as you were leaving

17:01.354 --> 17:03.230
the police station.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.649
It was actually funny,

17:03.272 --> 17:04.649
'cause we made a lot

17:03.272 --> 17:04.649
of eye contact,

17:04.691 --> 17:05.775
but you just drove off.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.193
Anyways, I'm here now.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.193
We can go.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.653
You want us to take

17:07.234 --> 17:08.653
you back to New York

17:08.695 --> 17:10.196
after you got my

17:08.695 --> 17:10.196
friends arrested?

17:10.237 --> 17:11.447
Nuh-uh.

17:10.237 --> 17:11.447
You flyin' commercial, son.

17:11.489 --> 17:12.824
[Doug] I hope you get

17:11.489 --> 17:12.824
a middle seat.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.116
I hope they charge

17:12.866 --> 17:14.116
you for your carry-ons.

17:14.158 --> 17:15.576
I hope you sit next

17:14.158 --> 17:15.576
to someone chatty.

17:15.618 --> 17:17.077
Someone going through

17:15.618 --> 17:17.077
something real hard.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.705
I hope the pilot makes

17:17.119 --> 17:18.705
an announcement during

17:18.746 --> 17:20.331
the emotional climax

17:18.746 --> 17:20.331
of the movie you're watching.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.375
-Ooh, you nasty!

17:20.373 --> 17:22.375
-Damn, Doug and Trudy Judy.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.919
Look, I'm sorry,

17:22.416 --> 17:24.919
but it was grand larceny.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.462
I couldn't just let them

17:24.961 --> 17:26.462
get away with it.

17:26.504 --> 17:27.881
Well if you were

17:26.504 --> 17:27.881
gonna arrest them anyway,

17:27.922 --> 17:29.007
why bother with

17:27.922 --> 17:29.007
the reverse heist?

17:29.048 --> 17:30.717
It's like Trudy said.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.259
We didn't have the diamonds.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.259
There wasn't enough evidence.

17:32.301 --> 17:33.427
But we put them back.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.095
Yeah,

17:33.469 --> 17:35.095
only because I was there.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.389
Not to mention the fact

17:35.137 --> 17:36.389
that I was fully complicit.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.515
I could've gone to jail.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.141
Wait,

17:37.557 --> 17:39.141
we destroyed your phone.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.852
-How did you call for backup?

17:39.183 --> 17:40.852
-That was actually easy.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.645
When Doug was distracted,

17:40.894 --> 17:42.645
yelling at the concierge...

17:42.687 --> 17:44.188
Let me talk

17:42.687 --> 17:44.188
to my general manager.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.733
<i>...I swapped out my</i>

17:44.230 --> 17:46.733
<i>waterlogged phone for his.</i>

17:46.774 --> 17:48.735
Damn! I would have noticed that

17:46.774 --> 17:48.735
if I wasn't trying

17:48.776 --> 17:50.862
to live in the moment and

17:48.776 --> 17:50.862
not look at my phone so much.

17:50.904 --> 17:53.280
And then when I was hidden

17:50.904 --> 17:53.280
in the cart, I called the cops.

17:53.322 --> 17:54.866
Mm, impossible.

17:53.322 --> 17:54.866
I would've heard you.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.492
Not with the Smush Shush!

17:56.534 --> 17:59.037
[softly] This is Jake Peralta.

17:56.534 --> 17:59.037
I'm a detective with the NYPD.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.580
[groans]

17:59.078 --> 18:00.580
Foot cramp, foot cramp.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.373
First of all, how dare you!

18:02.415 --> 18:04.751
Second of all,

18:02.415 --> 18:04.751
will you call Barbara Corcoran

18:04.792 --> 18:06.627
and tell her that this

18:04.792 --> 18:06.627
product is not useless?

18:06.669 --> 18:09.380
I don't know her.

18:06.669 --> 18:09.380
I'm sorry that I betrayed you,

18:09.422 --> 18:11.257
Doug, but I'm a cop.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.257
I didn't have a choice.

18:11.298 --> 18:13.384
-We can still be friends,

18:11.298 --> 18:13.384
right?

18:11.298 --> 18:13.384
-[Doug] I don't know.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.970
Did you even illegally

18:13.426 --> 18:15.970
download that O-Town album?

18:16.930 --> 18:18.681
-No.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.681
-[Trudy grunts]

18:18.723 --> 18:21.392
I bought it at their concert.

18:18.723 --> 18:21.392
Came bundled with a sweatshirt.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.853
-You make me sick.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.853
-Disgusting.

18:23.895 --> 18:25.312
Doug!

18:25.354 --> 18:26.439
Trudy!

18:26.480 --> 18:27.982
Judys!

18:29.233 --> 18:30.276
[Terry] Hey, sir.

18:30.317 --> 18:31.444
I'm sure you're

18:30.317 --> 18:31.444
still mad at us.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.279
Just you, not Diaz.

18:33.320 --> 18:36.074
Okay, well,

18:33.320 --> 18:36.074
I can't get that card back,

18:36.115 --> 18:37.992
but I did bring you these.

18:38.034 --> 18:40.787
They're business cards

18:38.034 --> 18:40.787
of people you've helped.

18:40.828 --> 18:43.706
One mistake did not make

18:40.828 --> 18:43.706
you the cop you are today.

18:43.748 --> 18:46.751
30 years of service

18:43.748 --> 18:46.751
to the community did.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.127
That should be your motivation.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.712
I know you can't

18:48.168 --> 18:49.712
remember their names, but--

18:49.754 --> 18:52.924
Alex Chen.

18:49.754 --> 18:52.924
I do remember him.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.884
36-year-old male,

18:52.966 --> 18:54.884
carjacked at the corner

18:54.926 --> 18:56.469
of 7th Avenue and 11th Street.

18:56.510 --> 18:59.263
Had three siblings,

18:56.510 --> 18:59.263
Alice, Arlene, and Anna.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.099
Okay, so you

18:59.305 --> 19:01.099
remember Alex Chen.

19:01.140 --> 19:05.519
Yes, and I really helped him.

19:01.140 --> 19:05.519
Perhaps he'll be my new Zeff.

19:05.561 --> 19:06.813
Welcome back, Captain Holt.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.230
I'm really glad

19:06.854 --> 19:08.230
we could help you with this.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.983
Oh, no, you're not gonna

19:08.272 --> 19:09.983
just jump back in here

19:10.024 --> 19:11.150
now that it all worked out!

19:11.191 --> 19:12.902
-Thank you, Diaz.

19:11.191 --> 19:12.902
-No!

19:12.944 --> 19:15.404
No, thank Terry!

19:12.944 --> 19:15.404
I did this!

19:15.446 --> 19:18.532
Oh, I'm done. You know what?

19:15.446 --> 19:18.532
I did all this! This was all me!

19:18.574 --> 19:20.076
This is ridiculous!

19:22.120 --> 19:24.705
-We barely got to know her.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.705
-[Hitchcock] And now

19:22.120 --> 19:24.705
we never will.

19:24.747 --> 19:27.083
I feel so bad for them,

19:24.747 --> 19:27.083
but what do you say to someone

19:27.125 --> 19:28.626
that's suffered

19:27.125 --> 19:28.626
this kind of loss?

19:28.668 --> 19:30.962
I mean, it's kind of

19:28.668 --> 19:30.962
on them for not checking

19:31.004 --> 19:33.756
the voltage on a machine

19:31.004 --> 19:33.756
that has a built in air-fryer.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.341
Don't blame the victim, Amy.

19:35.382 --> 19:37.384
[Charles] Okay, guys, look.

19:35.382 --> 19:37.384
I know this is sad,

19:37.426 --> 19:38.719
but maybe everything

19:37.426 --> 19:38.719
happens for a reason.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.429
What reason

19:38.761 --> 19:40.429
could there possibly be

19:40.471 --> 19:41.764
for the pain I'm feeling?

19:41.806 --> 19:43.349
Look, I probably

19:41.806 --> 19:43.349
shouldn't be telling you this

19:43.390 --> 19:45.059
because I know you'll abuse it,

19:45.101 --> 19:47.061
but when there's

19:45.101 --> 19:47.061
no third machine,

19:47.103 --> 19:49.647
you can come back here...

19:49.689 --> 19:51.732
and do this.

19:51.774 --> 19:54.193
-[machine whirs]

19:51.774 --> 19:54.193
-[snack thuds]

19:54.234 --> 19:55.987
Everything

19:54.234 --> 19:55.987
happens for a reason.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.947
Peralta!

19:56.029 --> 19:57.947
You have to see this.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.119
Guy got brought

20:01.742 --> 20:03.119
in this morning.

20:03.161 --> 20:04.328
Look what we found on him.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.788
Yeah, I get it, Rosa.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.790
Every perp in the city

20:05.830 --> 20:07.790
is invited and I'm not.

20:07.832 --> 20:09.083
But I--

20:09.125 --> 20:11.502
Wait a minute.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.502
Why is my name on this?

20:11.544 --> 20:13.880
'Cause you're coming

20:11.544 --> 20:13.880
to the wedding, baby!

20:13.921 --> 20:16.256
What's going on?

20:13.921 --> 20:16.256
You're not mad at me anymore?

20:16.298 --> 20:17.591
I arrested your best man.

20:17.633 --> 20:18.968
Just like I wanted you to.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.887
I was putting on a show

20:19.010 --> 20:20.887
in front of Trudy.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.304
What?

20:22.346 --> 20:24.098
Katherine, my fiancée,

20:22.346 --> 20:24.098
doesn't want any of my

20:24.140 --> 20:25.391
crook friends

20:24.140 --> 20:25.391
coming to the wedding.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.101
She's a federal judge,

20:25.432 --> 20:27.101
how would that look?

20:27.143 --> 20:28.936
Okay, but couldn't you just

20:27.143 --> 20:28.936
tell them they're not invited?

20:28.978 --> 20:31.189
Eh...that's an uncomfortable

20:28.978 --> 20:31.189
conversation to have.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.523
It was much easier this way.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.525
Oh, my God...

20:34.567 --> 20:37.111
-this whole thing was a setup?

20:34.567 --> 20:37.111
-[chuckles]

20:37.153 --> 20:38.487
You<i> wanted</i> me

20:37.153 --> 20:38.487
to find that invitation.

20:38.529 --> 20:39.697
Mm-hmm.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.240
You knew I would

20:39.739 --> 20:41.240
never go on a trip

20:41.281 --> 20:42.408
with a bunch of crooks

20:41.281 --> 20:42.408
unless I felt unwanted.

20:42.449 --> 20:43.826
Classic negging.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.828
I bet you planned

20:43.868 --> 20:45.828
to have your bachelor party

20:45.870 --> 20:48.122
at that hotel because you knew

20:45.870 --> 20:48.122
the oligarch was staying there.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.582
Hell, yeah. Otherwise

20:48.164 --> 20:49.582
I would've got an Airbnb.

20:49.623 --> 20:51.291
And as soon as your

20:49.623 --> 20:51.291
friends committed a crime,

20:51.333 --> 20:53.293
you banked on me

20:51.333 --> 20:53.293
<i>needing</i> to arrest them.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.795
Damn right.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.795
You're the most consistent

20:54.837 --> 20:55.963
person in my life, Peralta.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.215
I can always count on you.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.175
But, there is one

20:57.256 --> 20:59.175
detail you missed.

20:59.217 --> 21:01.677
You never saw what

20:59.217 --> 21:01.677
I was painting on the inside

21:01.719 --> 21:04.013
of my mug at

21:01.719 --> 21:04.013
the pottery place.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.099
"Will you be my best man"?

21:06.140 --> 21:07.892
Judy, is--

21:06.140 --> 21:07.892

21:07.934 --> 21:09.060
