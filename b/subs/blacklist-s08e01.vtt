[cell phone ringing]

00:11.511 --> 00:13.430
Hello? What?

00:15.265 --> 00:16.558
I'll be right there.

00:16.641 --> 00:17.851
[elevator dings]

00:21.187 --> 00:24.357
-Excuse me, sir. Your business?
-Hotel Medical Services.

00:24.441 --> 00:27.193
We received a call from a guest
with nausea and vomiting.

00:27.277 --> 00:31.281
We've got a defendant under house arrest.
We have orders to monitor the floor.

00:31.364 --> 00:33.408
This guest is a UN investigator

00:34.117 --> 00:37.037
who thinks he may have been exposed
to nuclear materials.

00:40.957 --> 00:42.333
[knocking on door]

[door closes]

00:44.294 --> 00:45.295
Hello?

00:49.674 --> 00:51.468
Oh, my God. He's on fire.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.511
This guy's prodromal.

00:54.220 --> 00:57.098
-So, you're saying he was exposed?
-He needs a hospital.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.725
[elevator dings]

00:59.184 --> 01:03.021
Agonal respirations. Thready pulse.
You're gonna need to ventilate.

01:03.688 --> 01:05.899
-You coming?
-It's contagious, right?

01:05.982 --> 01:08.985
Yeah, like the giggles,
if the giggles could kill you.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.155
We're in.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.923
[woman moaning on TV]

01:38.389 --> 01:39.307
What the--?

01:39.390 --> 01:41.309
-Who are you?
-I'm here to get you out.

01:41.392 --> 01:43.394
Who sent you? Coates? Bryson?

01:43.478 --> 01:46.231
We need to go now.
I hope you're not afraid of heights.

01:53.863 --> 01:54.864
Step in.

01:55.573 --> 01:58.952
EMI-shielding. So the feds won't know
we removed your ankle monitor.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.170
So, how do we get past the cops?

02:09.254 --> 02:10.713
[elevator dings]

02:14.300 --> 02:17.804
No one goes in or out of this room
until it's decontaminated. Got it?

02:23.393 --> 02:24.477
[chuckles]

02:25.395 --> 02:26.771
Hey! Hey!

02:26.855 --> 02:29.190
[suspenseful music playing]

02:30.441 --> 02:31.985
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

02:38.283 --> 02:39.325
Stop right there.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.636
-[Raymond] When did it happen?
-Over two hours ago.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.554
Two hours?

02:59.637 --> 03:02.307
I didn't want to call till I knew
the news was good. It's good.

03:02.390 --> 03:03.892
-How good?
-It's safe to say

03:03.975 --> 03:06.102
he's back to his same old chipper self.

03:06.185 --> 03:07.520
[Raymond] Hello, Dom.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.355
You've been outflanked.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.025
Katarina's been surprisingly formidable.

03:12.108 --> 03:16.905
Ah. Like France guarding
the Maginot Line during the Blitzkrieg.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.073
She still hasn't found what she's after.

03:19.157 --> 03:23.161
She captured and nearly killed you.
She put me in a coma.

03:23.244 --> 03:27.290
Anything else?
Or on the seventh day did she rest?

03:28.291 --> 03:30.585
-You should rest.
-So, there is more.

03:31.336 --> 03:34.422
The seizures are gone,
but the doctor says keeping it that way

03:34.505 --> 03:37.842
requires you to be calm and rested.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.844
It's Masha now, isn't it?

03:39.928 --> 03:41.930
[dramatic music playing]

03:43.014 --> 03:44.515
She knows I'm not Ilya.

03:46.184 --> 03:49.479
So, she knows I lied to her.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.314
Elizabeth is here.

03:56.569 --> 03:57.904
We want the same thing.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.406
With her help, we'll get it.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.701
I want Masha's trust. I had it.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.412
Thanks to you, I don't have it anymore.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.256
How's the patient?

04:16.339 --> 04:20.677
Tired. He just... needs more rest.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.348
We have a case to discuss.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.225
[Liz] Roanoke?

04:27.308 --> 04:28.893
[Raymond] He makes people disappear,

04:28.977 --> 04:31.896
-like Maddy Tolliver.
-Is that what her banker told you?

04:31.980 --> 04:32.981
She contracted him?

04:33.064 --> 04:35.441
[Raymond] At her instruction,
the banker wired money

04:35.525 --> 04:38.987
to a Philadelphia account
controlled by Roanoke.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.115
Your tremors are gone.

04:43.574 --> 04:44.575
They are.

04:46.369 --> 04:48.454
But not the underlying condition.

04:49.455 --> 04:52.542
I need you to focus on Roanoke, not on me.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.168
Can you do that?

04:57.338 --> 05:01.050
General Kony gave combat-ready troops
the slip in Uganda.

05:01.134 --> 05:05.722
Achemez Gochiyayev killed 293 people
in the apartment bombings

05:05.805 --> 05:10.184
that triggered the Second Chechen War
and then was never seen again.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.729
Both vanished, escaped capture,

05:12.812 --> 05:15.481
with the assistance of a man
who calls himself Roanoke.

05:15.565 --> 05:18.693
Roanoke. Like the Lost Colony
that mysteriously vanished?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.237
Cute. Do we have a name?

05:21.321 --> 05:25.241
We don't know his name or location
or even if he's still alive.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.995
Reddington says Roanoke was thought
to be dead or captured,

05:29.078 --> 05:32.457
but a recent extraction
in Pennsylvania proves otherwise.

05:32.540 --> 05:35.209
We believe this is Roanoke.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.335
I know this guy.

05:36.419 --> 05:39.922
He was arrested after 9/11 for getting
al Qaeda loyalists out of the country.

05:40.006 --> 05:43.468
-If he's in our system, we have an ID.
-[Liz] We have his prints, his DNA.

05:43.551 --> 05:46.262
We know he has a distinctive scar
on his right cheek.

05:46.345 --> 05:48.139
What we don't have is a name.

05:48.222 --> 05:51.768
The authorities at Qincheng Prison got
a series of aliases

05:51.851 --> 05:53.853
but nothing authentic before he escaped.

05:53.936 --> 05:55.229
He escaped Qincheng?

05:55.313 --> 05:57.690
Tell us about the extraction
in Pennsylvania.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.109
Lev Pasternak, Russian oligarch.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.487
Disappeared from a Philadelphia hotel room

06:02.570 --> 06:05.573
where he was on house arrest,
pending trial for murder.

06:05.656 --> 06:07.408
Let's get a team to look for him.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.994
You should know the reason
Reddington gave us this case

06:10.078 --> 06:13.247
is because the next person
Roanoke is supposed to disappear...

06:13.915 --> 06:15.083
is Maddy Tolliver.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.626
What? Uh...

06:17.752 --> 06:20.379
-I thought she was dead.
-Yeah, no, she's not.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.092
Why didn't you tell us?

06:24.175 --> 06:26.594
[Liz] Because she's also not
Maddy Tolliver.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.555
She's my mother.

06:30.681 --> 06:33.351
Whoa, whoa, whoa, uh, hang on a second.

06:33.434 --> 06:36.104
The woman from across the hall is your--

06:36.854 --> 06:40.441
That means you got to spend time
with your mom, after all these years.

06:40.525 --> 06:44.237
She was pretending to be someone else
and trying to kill people you care about,

06:44.320 --> 06:48.741
but still, that must have been,
you know, uh, meaningful?

06:49.534 --> 06:52.620
[Park] Does Reddington understand
he's asking you to capture your mother?

06:52.703 --> 06:56.332
And if you do,
she might get the death penalty?

06:56.415 --> 06:58.376
Yeah, I think he does.

07:00.336 --> 07:03.589
-And so do I.
-Really? Because Park's right.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.800
Your mother's life may hang
in the balance.

07:05.883 --> 07:10.304
And if we do this,
your allegiance has to be to us, not her.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.931
Can you promise me that?

07:12.974 --> 07:14.851
Yes. I can.

07:15.351 --> 07:17.353
Okay, then. Roll out.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.609
-How could you tell him that?
-Because it's the truth.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.529
You're not gonna tell your mother
we're hunting her down?

07:26.612 --> 07:28.281
I don't have to. She knows.

07:28.364 --> 07:30.700
-How? Who told her?
-She had the chance

07:30.783 --> 07:33.953
to keep Reddington from meeting
her banker. She didn't take it.

07:34.495 --> 07:35.997
Why would she do that?

07:36.080 --> 07:37.707
I have absolutely no idea.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.209
Because it makes her easier to be found.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.970
Who was the mastermind
behind getting me out?

07:51.053 --> 07:51.888
Roanoke.

07:51.971 --> 07:55.099
Whoever that is,
I'm gonna make him filthy rich.

07:55.183 --> 07:58.060
The only reward he wants is for you
to stand right there.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.104
Okay, sure. What happens right here?

08:02.523 --> 08:03.524
Oh, no. No.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.868
[marshal] I noticed it too late.

08:13.951 --> 08:16.454
Two EMTs went in, three came out.

08:16.537 --> 08:19.707
By the time I got down there,
Pasternak was in the ambulance.

08:19.790 --> 08:22.752
-[Ressler] Can you ID the guys?
-ID them? I thought I shot them.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.379
You didn't shoot anyone. Maybe you missed.

08:25.463 --> 08:28.633
Maybe. But I did two tours
in Afghanistan as a sniper.

08:29.133 --> 08:29.967
I don't miss.

08:33.471 --> 08:36.516
[Liz] Aram just sent this over
from the hotel security feeds.

08:38.017 --> 08:41.729
-Ballistic glass.
-And armor plated. Look how low it rides.

08:41.812 --> 08:43.439
An armor-plated ambulance.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.441
[marshal] I told you I don't miss.

08:46.734 --> 08:49.070
Whoever did the retrofit did it
for Roanoke.

08:49.153 --> 08:52.114
-Could be he knows how to find him.
-I'll text the man in the hat.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.201
If anyone knows who makes
armor-plated ambulances, it's him.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.287
[blender whirring]

09:03.668 --> 09:06.379
What is the meaning of this?
Who do you think you are?

09:06.462 --> 09:12.343
Fun fact: Li Qing Yuen ate wolfberries
every day of his life

09:12.426 --> 09:18.057
and was said to have lived
to the ripe old age of 256,

09:18.140 --> 09:23.187
from 1677 to 1933.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.564
Imagine!

09:25.690 --> 09:29.652
He could have had dinner
with both Newton and Einstein.

09:30.152 --> 09:31.320
Separately, of course.

09:31.404 --> 09:36.117
Elizabeth texted something
about a custom armor-plate job?

09:36.784 --> 09:38.244
Give her Eduardo's number

09:38.327 --> 09:42.373
and tell her she may need to incentivize
dear Eddie to get him to talk.

09:42.456 --> 09:43.916
To immortality.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.753
[ominous music playing]

09:47.837 --> 09:48.671
[Raymond sighs]

09:49.839 --> 09:53.718
My associate spoke to the doorman
on his way into your building.

09:53.801 --> 09:58.514
And the doorman said a downstairs
apartment recently sold for 4-6.

09:58.598 --> 10:02.727
There's another on the market, but I doubt
the board will approve your application.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.521
I'm surprised they approved yours.

10:05.938 --> 10:11.277
Or did you fail to mention your role
in helping Roanoke escape captivity?

10:11.360 --> 10:16.032
I suppose a lot of Park Avenue apartments
are owned by your countrymen,

10:16.115 --> 10:19.910
but I doubt any of them used to be
superintendent of a Chinese prison.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.371
What do you want?

10:25.166 --> 10:26.167
What do I want?

10:28.252 --> 10:33.716
Years ago, I was in a taxi on my way
to a rendezvous in Kowloon City.

10:33.799 --> 10:36.552
This must have been around '98, '99.

10:36.636 --> 10:41.265
They'd just closed Kai Tak Airport,
and everything was going in and out

10:41.349 --> 10:44.935
of the big,
brand-new Hong Kong International.

10:45.019 --> 10:47.188
The place was "gigundous."

10:47.271 --> 10:50.650
Largest passenger terminal
in the world at the time.

10:50.733 --> 10:56.614
I'd come in on a cargo flight,
and it was absolute madness over there.

10:56.697 --> 11:00.159
My ground transport had gotten screwed up,
so I grabbed a taxi.

11:00.242 --> 11:01.911
I was running about an hour late

11:01.994 --> 11:05.539
and was a little out of sorts,
so I'm sure I put the driver on edge,

11:05.623 --> 11:09.460
although he seemed pretty unflappable
and he had a hell of a heavy foot.

11:09.543 --> 11:12.963
Anyway, we're doing our best.
Traffic is terrible.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.757
The guy is bobbing and weaving,

11:14.840 --> 11:17.510
and I'm trying to relax
with one eye on the clock.

11:17.593 --> 11:21.972
Meanwhile, Jerzy's been sitting
at the Lucky Duck for 45 minutes,

11:22.056 --> 11:25.393
so, given his usual 15 minutes a drink,

11:25.476 --> 11:29.271
Jerzy's just finished his third
gin and tonic, with a fourth on the way.

11:29.355 --> 11:34.402
Now, I think the world and all of Jerzy,
but at his best, he's a bit stroppy.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.612
And after four or five G and T's,

11:36.695 --> 11:39.156
he's starting to look around
for someone to mess with.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.866
So, I'm feeling a little...

11:42.326 --> 11:43.411
vulnerable.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.206
I'm looking out the window.
We're stopped at a light.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.542
And all of a sudden,

11:50.459 --> 11:52.711
right there in the middle
of the intersection

11:52.795 --> 11:56.257
is this scrawny little cat,
a kitten, really,

11:56.340 --> 11:59.218
crying, meowing, scared to death.

11:59.301 --> 12:03.639
And traffic everywhere,
I mean everywhere. Four lanes.

12:04.432 --> 12:05.433
And I just--

12:08.269 --> 12:10.354
And then the cat looked at me...

12:11.939 --> 12:15.317
stopped crying,
closed its mouth, blinked...

12:16.819 --> 12:18.571
and just stared at me.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.282
Like...

12:26.036 --> 12:27.121
Like it knew me.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.293
It took a couple of steps forward.

12:32.376 --> 12:36.172
I started to open the door
and, whoom, the taxi took off.

12:36.881 --> 12:37.882
And there we went.

12:40.342 --> 12:41.552
And there went the cat.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.603
Jerzy was fine.

12:51.645 --> 12:52.897
Drunk. Angry.

12:55.399 --> 12:56.317
But he was fine.

13:01.906 --> 13:02.907
What do I want?

13:04.992 --> 13:05.993
I want that cat.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.039
And Roanoke.

13:10.706 --> 13:13.584
I wish I could help,
but he didn't say where he was going.

13:13.667 --> 13:16.337
-A name, then.
-I don't know his name.

13:16.420 --> 13:19.882
The name you provided him with.
The passport, the driver's license.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.300
I want that name...

13:22.676 --> 13:23.677
and the cat.

13:27.806 --> 13:29.016
Santiago Vega.

13:29.099 --> 13:30.976
[Raymond] <i>A name he may</i>
<i>or may not be using.</i>

13:31.060 --> 13:33.395
-You don't know where he is?
<i>-Not yet but I will.</i>

13:33.479 --> 13:37.483
Heddie, I need you to reach out
to your contacts at the IRS.

13:37.566 --> 13:38.901
Dig into his financials,

13:38.984 --> 13:41.445
see if you can help us
track this guy down.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.448
All right. I'll talk to my people
and circle back.

13:44.532 --> 13:45.991
Even if he's using an alias,

13:46.075 --> 13:48.285
sooner or later,
the IRS is gonna find him.

13:48.369 --> 13:52.164
Like Joe Louis to Billy Conn,
"You can run, but you can't hide."

13:52.248 --> 13:55.417
The Brown Bomber.
I look for him in my dreams every night.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.753
<i>Don't worry, Raymond. I'm on it.</i>

13:59.129 --> 14:01.131
[suspenseful music playing]

14:02.758 --> 14:03.968
[Ressler] Eduardo Martinez?

14:05.761 --> 14:06.804
Can I help you?

14:06.887 --> 14:08.764
Agents Ressler, Keen, FBI.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.433
We're looking for a man
who customized an ambulance.

14:11.976 --> 14:16.021
-I'd have to check my records.
-That's a pretty heavy door. Armor-plated?

14:16.105 --> 14:18.440
Yes. A custom job for a Thai executive.

14:18.524 --> 14:21.235
The ambulance we're talking about
was armor-plated.

14:21.318 --> 14:22.987
Like I said, I have to check.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.822
You do that. And we will, too.

14:24.905 --> 14:27.449
Make sure all your, uh,
work visas are in order.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.828
-Hey, I pay my taxes.
-And you employ a lot of people.

14:30.911 --> 14:33.163
We don't want to mess with that.
And we won't,

14:33.247 --> 14:35.416
if you tell us who hired you

14:35.499 --> 14:37.501
to armor-plate that ambulance
and where to find him.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.963
[Martinez] There's a warehouse,
3rd and Windham.

14:51.348 --> 14:54.143
[Liz] Plans for the hotel
where they took Pasternak.

14:54.226 --> 14:55.895
Roanoke was definitely here.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.939
Which means we're one step closer
to finding him...

14:59.648 --> 15:02.318
and Reddington's one step closer
to finding my mother.

15:02.401 --> 15:05.571
You said she wanted her banker
to tell Reddington about Roanoke.

15:05.654 --> 15:09.325
Okay, but how did she know
Red was meeting with her banker?

15:09.408 --> 15:11.785
Who tipped her off? It was you, wasn't it?

15:11.869 --> 15:13.203
Yeah, I warned her.

15:13.287 --> 15:16.081
[Ressler] She ignored your warning.
Why would she do that?

15:16.165 --> 15:17.207
[Liz] I don't know.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.627
So, you have picked a side. Hers.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.504
-Over his, yeah.
-And over ours.

15:22.588 --> 15:23.505
What do you mean?

15:23.589 --> 15:26.258
You told Cooper
that we have your allegiance. Do we?

15:29.678 --> 15:31.931
Keen, do we have your allegiance or not?

15:34.642 --> 15:36.185
[knocking on door]

15:40.314 --> 15:41.315
You lied to me.

15:42.149 --> 15:45.778
-You told me Roanoke was your escape plan.
-He is.

15:45.861 --> 15:49.698
Then why is he surveilling the warehouse
where my grandfather's being kept?

15:49.782 --> 15:53.661
The only way I can be safe is if Dom
tells me everything I need to know.

15:53.744 --> 15:56.080
That won't happen
unless I get him away from Red.

15:56.163 --> 15:58.415
-Roanoke can do that.
-Abduct my grandfather?

15:58.499 --> 15:59.333
Yes.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.794
So your mother can survive.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.757
I think it's time you tell me everything.

16:12.012 --> 16:14.014
[dramatic music playing]

16:14.098 --> 16:16.517
Let's start with Dom
and why you want to abduct him.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.269
All you can see is
what I want to do to him.

16:19.353 --> 16:22.523
What I want you to see
is what he did to me.

16:23.232 --> 16:27.027
In the West, you tell your young men
to stand up for their country.

16:27.111 --> 16:30.489
In Russia, young women were told
to lay down with the enemy.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.158
That's how you showed loyalty.

16:33.951 --> 16:35.995
As the daughter
of a domineering spy master,

16:36.078 --> 16:37.871
I never had a voice in my future.

16:39.081 --> 16:43.335
I was 15 the first time they ordered me
to sleep with a young American soldier.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.422
Dom was the man who ordered me.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.092
That's awful. I'm so sorry.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.303
One reason I gave up my little girl...

16:55.097 --> 16:59.101
arranged for you to grow up
in this country, was to spare you my fate.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.103
And because you had to disappear.

17:01.186 --> 17:04.356
Which I never could have done
or would've done...

17:05.357 --> 17:06.525
if you weren't safe.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.280
And you were safe, Masha.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.368
Until that man who calls himself
Raymond Reddington

17:16.452 --> 17:19.788
pulled you into the middle of everything
I was protecting you from.

17:20.247 --> 17:23.250
I don't know who Reddington is,
but I know he betrayed me.

17:23.333 --> 17:26.462
Reddington, along with my father
and my best friend.

17:27.463 --> 17:31.508
The secrets you're looking for,
they tried to murder me to bury them.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.635
What secret could be so powerful

17:33.719 --> 17:36.221
that a father would be willing
to murder his own daughter?

17:39.558 --> 17:41.351
What do you know about N-13?

17:42.436 --> 17:44.813
N-13? I don't know what that is.

17:44.897 --> 17:48.275
Not a what, a who. N-13 is an operative.

17:48.358 --> 17:52.571
The "N" stands for <i>"neopoznanny,"</i>
the Russian word for "unidentified."

17:52.654 --> 17:55.657
Thirteen represents
the 13 packets of intel

17:55.741 --> 17:58.202
he stole from Lubyanka Square in 1990.

17:58.285 --> 17:59.787
You're talking about a KGB mole.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.122
One whose identity remains unknown.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.500
A turncoat who was never proven to exist.

18:04.583 --> 18:07.002
Thirty years of hunting
and still no one knows.

18:07.086 --> 18:10.172
-N-13 is still active?
-Depending on who you ask.

18:10.255 --> 18:13.759
The CIA, MSS, MI5, the Mossad,

18:13.842 --> 18:17.387
all believe he continues to cipher
some of their most damaging intel.

18:17.471 --> 18:18.931
From other governments?

18:19.014 --> 18:22.434
-Why? To what end?
-To build a compromising file.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.186
The Sikorsky Archive.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.063
You said it's a blackmail file.

18:26.146 --> 18:29.983
One that started with 13 intel packets
over 30 years ago

18:30.067 --> 18:31.735
and has been evolving ever since.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.779
That's why there was
a bounty on your head.

18:33.862 --> 18:34.696
Yes.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.783
Because Dom set me up.

18:37.866 --> 18:40.577
He leaked to the KGB that I was N-13.

18:40.661 --> 18:44.873
That the dossier Ilya asked me to deliver
that night was the elusive Archive.

18:45.582 --> 18:47.543
-He framed you.
-And tried to murder me

18:47.626 --> 18:50.963
-before the truth could be known.
-Why? Who were they protecting?

18:51.046 --> 18:52.923
-[scoffs]
-What?

18:53.006 --> 18:56.969
-You think Reddington is N-13?
-Or Dom. Or both.

18:57.052 --> 19:01.431
I believe Dom framed me
so everyone would stop looking for N-13.

19:03.183 --> 19:05.853
Had I died that night, they would have.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.313
But you didn't.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.732
That's why you're still on the run.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.193
Wrongly accused.

19:14.027 --> 19:15.821
Hunted for a crime I didn't commit.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.198
[Liz] So, N-13...

19:19.283 --> 19:21.076
Reddington is a mole.

19:23.537 --> 19:27.082
Who has manipulated you
to gain access to top U.S. intelligence.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.919
Masha, Reddington didn't choose you.
He needed you.

19:31.837 --> 19:36.258
He traded on the questions you have
about your past to gain immunity.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.468
He gives you criminals, and in exchange,

19:38.552 --> 19:40.804
he learns the names
of every high-level official

19:40.888 --> 19:45.517
working in American justice,
law enforcement and intelligence.

19:45.601 --> 19:48.061
So, this whole time,
Reddington's been using me.

19:48.145 --> 19:52.065
The task force has been this Trojan horse

19:52.149 --> 19:55.152
he's been using
to obtain classified intel.

19:55.235 --> 19:57.321
A father figure is trying
to manipulate you

19:57.404 --> 19:59.114
the way my father manipulated me.

19:59.948 --> 20:03.035
Dom is lying about me. I am not N-13.

20:03.118 --> 20:06.330
I do not have the Archive.
But unless I get him to tell me who does,

20:06.413 --> 20:08.749
to give me proof
that I can show the world...

20:10.167 --> 20:11.168
I will be killed.

20:13.212 --> 20:16.673
I get it now. Why you let
your banker meet with Reddington.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.635
Why you wanted Reddington
to have us chase after Roanoke.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.721
So we would find the warehouse,
find the photo.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.974
Warn Reddington
that you were going after Dom,

20:26.058 --> 20:29.061
while he's convalescing
in a well-guarded warehouse.

20:29.686 --> 20:32.606
-But if they think it's under attack--
-Reddington will move Dom.

20:32.689 --> 20:35.317
-And while he's being moved--
-He's a soft target.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.154
It's quite a plan, and it could work.

20:40.322 --> 20:43.617
It almost has worked,
in every way except one.

20:46.745 --> 20:49.289
The FBI didn't find that photo. I did.

20:50.749 --> 20:53.502
Which means my fate is in your hands.

20:54.086 --> 20:57.339
-As well as my grandfather's.
-And Reddington.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.758
Someone who killed the man who raised you,

20:59.841 --> 21:02.094
was responsible for the death
of the man you loved...

21:02.803 --> 21:04.221
and who's so manipulative,

21:04.721 --> 21:07.849
he was willing to let you believe
he was your father.

21:12.729 --> 21:13.855
You wanted the truth.

21:15.607 --> 21:16.858
I've given it to you.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.863
It's up to you what you do with it.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.125
[suspenseful music playing]

21:39.131 --> 21:40.632
[Liz] <i>And I'm supposed to believe you?</i>

21:40.716 --> 21:42.384
[Raymond laughs] <i>Of course not.</i>

21:43.135 --> 21:45.595
I'm a criminal.
Criminals are notorious liars.

21:45.679 --> 21:48.098
<i>-Everything about me is a lie.</i>
-[Liz] <i>Why me?</i>

21:48.181 --> 21:51.018
I wish the answer were as simple
as the question seems.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.728
[Liz] <i>Are you my father?</i>

21:53.520 --> 21:54.604
No.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.149
[cell phone ringing]

22:03.238 --> 22:06.325
Hey. Thanks for calling me back.
I need to talk to you.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.494
No, in person.

22:13.790 --> 22:15.792
[dramatic music playing]

22:18.003 --> 22:19.671
We have a break in the case.

22:22.799 --> 22:24.009
Tell me.

22:24.092 --> 22:27.512
I will, but I need you
to tell me something first.

22:28.513 --> 22:31.266
When my mother abducted you in Paris,
what did she want?

22:32.434 --> 22:33.935
From you, Dom, Dembe.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.146
She's been on a rampage.
I want to know why.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.444
He's a tough old bear.

22:44.571 --> 22:46.031
I know you're angry with him,

22:46.114 --> 22:48.575
but for what it's worth,
you inherited the best of him.

22:49.618 --> 22:53.163
That's it. That's your non-answer.

22:53.246 --> 22:56.291
I've given you my answer
every time you've asked.

22:56.374 --> 23:00.003
That you don't lie. You just withhold.

23:00.087 --> 23:04.382
That I have things that are mine
and no one else's.

23:08.970 --> 23:10.806
So, what's the break in the case?

23:14.101 --> 23:16.770
[Liz] I found this
at Roanoke's last known location.

23:17.354 --> 23:20.065
Dom is his next target, her next target.

23:25.737 --> 23:26.571
Dom.

23:27.531 --> 23:28.573
I can't lose him.

23:30.450 --> 23:31.576
Not like this.

23:33.161 --> 23:34.579
She's quite determined.

23:35.831 --> 23:37.374
You'll have to be as well.

23:41.461 --> 23:43.463
[somber music playing]

23:47.884 --> 23:49.010
[knocking on door]

23:49.803 --> 23:50.637
You okay?

23:53.431 --> 23:54.266
No, I'm not.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.271
I realized my mother can't be trusted.

24:01.439 --> 24:04.526
-Are you to be trusted?
-Yes.

24:06.194 --> 24:07.821
Good. I'm glad.

24:08.822 --> 24:11.575
And a little curious.
What did you find out about her?

24:13.410 --> 24:15.328
My mother's not using Roanoke to get away.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.956
She's using him to get
to my grandfather, Dominic.

24:18.039 --> 24:19.249
What proof do you have?

24:19.332 --> 24:23.295
I found this where Roanoke planned
his last job. It's the building where

24:23.378 --> 24:25.589
-my grandfather's being treated.
-Grandfather?

24:25.672 --> 24:27.966
Wait, your mother's target
is her own father?

24:28.049 --> 24:30.135
Yeah, it's a long story.

24:30.218 --> 24:32.929
-She hired Roanoke to abduct him?
-A very long story.

24:33.013 --> 24:35.515
She's looking for something.
Scorching, burning anything

24:35.599 --> 24:38.393
-that stands between her and getting it.
-Including her father.

24:38.476 --> 24:40.770
-Have you spoken to Reddington?
-[Liz] Yes, he agrees.

24:40.854 --> 24:43.481
Her next target is Dom
and she could attack at any minute.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.442
He wants to move Dom to a new safe house.

24:45.525 --> 24:49.154
I offered one of the plain-wrap
medical vans from the FBI fleet.

24:49.237 --> 24:52.240
[Cooper] We'll coordinate with Reddington.
Put a TAC team in the warehouse.

24:52.324 --> 24:55.911
Once we get Dom out, we'll be ready
for Roanoke to walk into our trap.

24:56.953 --> 24:58.705
[Latin music playing]

-Puerto Rico?
<i>-Mm-hm.</i>

25:02.542 --> 25:05.754
<i>Short story long,</i>
<i>I was able to use the IRS</i>

25:05.837 --> 25:08.924
to identify 14 Santiago Vegas.

25:09.007 --> 25:11.468
<i>Seven were deceased, two are minors,</i>

25:11.551 --> 25:15.096
and one has a current address in San Juan.

25:15.180 --> 25:19.392
And, according to an old photo
in the local newspaper,

25:19.476 --> 25:22.312
he's got the same exact scar
on the right side of his face.

25:22.395 --> 25:25.106
I have a contact in Bayamón.
We'll organize a team.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.400
<i>No need. I just spoke to his sister.</i>

25:27.484 --> 25:30.779
I was gonna tell her
that her brother has a tax refund--

25:30.862 --> 25:32.989
The man's hiding in Puerto Rico to hide.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.492
He's certainly not going
to come out of hiding

25:35.575 --> 25:37.494
to claim a refund on taxes he never paid.

25:37.577 --> 25:40.914
That's what Tony said,
which is why I went with his idea.

25:40.997 --> 25:43.500
I told her
I'm with the Mail Recovery Center,

25:45.669 --> 25:47.545

<i>-Right.</i>

25:47.629 --> 25:52.133
I told her I had a package that's been
searching for him for over four years,

25:52.217 --> 25:56.972
<i>but that only he could take possession</i>
<i>and that he had to sign himself.</i>

25:57.055 --> 26:02.310
She told me Vega was shacked up
in some resort on Parque Isla Verde.

26:02.394 --> 26:03.770
I'm following her there now.

26:03.853 --> 26:07.315
Neither snow, nor rain,
nor heat, nor gloom of night.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.776
Bless you, Heddie.
Call me when you know more.

26:14.114 --> 26:15.782
[suspenseful music playing]

26:20.036 --> 26:22.247
Four flat-free tires, as ordered.

26:22.330 --> 26:25.917
And the name of the guy who'd be able
to expedite a work visa, as requested.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.961
You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

26:28.044 --> 26:30.547
-No one's the wiser.
-It's like you were never here.

26:34.259 --> 26:37.012
[Dom] I got it. I got it. Leave me alone.

26:37.095 --> 26:38.805
I might've known.

26:38.888 --> 26:43.935
The minute you tell me I'm safe,
the candy stripers go on attack.

26:44.019 --> 26:47.063
I should've crawled out of here
the moment I woke up.

26:47.147 --> 26:49.357
I assure you the situation's in hand,

26:49.441 --> 26:54.154
but sometimes plans require changing,
just like your bedsheets.

26:54.237 --> 26:55.238
[grumbles]

26:58.033 --> 26:59.993
I don't like this.
He's in a fragile state.

27:00.076 --> 27:03.288
-His life depends--
-His life depends on staying alive.

27:03.371 --> 27:06.291
That means getting him out of here.
So, please,

27:06.374 --> 27:10.670
just try and do your job as best you can
without making mine more difficult.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.172
I've got him for that.

27:16.217 --> 27:19.220
We've uplinked the CCTV feeds
and got the snipers on the roof.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.765
I want to be informed
once you have Roanoke in custody.

27:21.848 --> 27:23.725
You and Ressler take point on the escort.

27:23.808 --> 27:26.269
-Raymond and I will be in the follow car.
-Copy that.

27:26.353 --> 27:29.356
I'm sorry. I have to be the one
behind the wheel of that van.

27:29.439 --> 27:33.818
Why? Is this some sort of
FBI insurance thing?

27:33.902 --> 27:37.947
More like "an FBI agent demanding
to protect her grandfather" thing.

27:38.031 --> 27:39.240
Uh-huh.

27:39.949 --> 27:41.534
We'll go check the vehicles.

27:47.248 --> 27:48.958
[Dom] You're angry with me...

27:50.001 --> 27:52.045
and I don't blame you.

27:52.128 --> 27:53.755
I misled you.

27:54.631 --> 27:55.632
I'm used to it.

27:57.050 --> 27:59.719
I know you have questions.

27:59.803 --> 28:02.555
You know what, Dom,
I really only ever had one question.

28:03.390 --> 28:06.601
Why? If he's not my father, then why me?

28:07.936 --> 28:10.939
I asked you and you told me
his real identity was Ilya Koslov,

28:11.022 --> 28:13.066
which it is not. Another lie.

28:14.109 --> 28:17.779
Are you really telling me you're ready
to dive into the truth? Now?

28:20.323 --> 28:25.328
I'm in an impossible situation.

28:26.996 --> 28:28.623
Yeah, that's about what I thought.

28:29.207 --> 28:34.129
Okay. Guys and gals, can we please
load the patient into the van?

28:34.212 --> 28:37.132
-We're frittering away time here.
-[Ressler] We're all set.

28:37.215 --> 28:38.633
TAC team's on standby.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.344
As soon as you roll out,
cameras go up and we lay in wait.

28:41.428 --> 28:43.930
When Roanoke strikes, we'll be ready.

28:44.013 --> 28:47.016
Don't look so disgruntled, Agent Fredrick.

28:47.100 --> 28:48.059
I don't bite.

28:48.768 --> 28:50.770
Unless you ever utter my name.

28:50.854 --> 28:54.983
In which case, I'll gut you like a fish
and feed you to the lobsters.

28:56.943 --> 28:57.944
Good pep talk.

28:59.195 --> 29:00.572
[Liz] What's our destination?

29:01.531 --> 29:04.576
I've secured a lodge on Deep Creek Lake.

29:04.659 --> 29:07.912
High on a bluff, easy to defend,
views for miles.

29:08.747 --> 29:09.748
And the route?

29:10.123 --> 29:14.836
We'll take back roads to 135.
Then it's a straight shot to the lake.

29:15.795 --> 29:17.255
-You get that?
-[Bahar] Yes.

29:17.338 --> 29:19.591
I can't believe
she's going through with this.

29:19.674 --> 29:21.342
How'd you get her to wear the wire?

29:22.844 --> 29:25.054
A daughter's need
for her mother's approval

29:25.138 --> 29:27.223
is nature's most powerful force.

29:30.226 --> 29:31.352
Move your team out.

29:39.819 --> 29:41.821
[suspenseful music playing]

30:03.927 --> 30:04.928
What is it, Raymond?

30:06.805 --> 30:09.307
-Just thinking.
-About?

30:09.390 --> 30:13.645
Roanoke's extractions are all...
inside jobs.

30:15.438 --> 30:18.399
He succeeds by putting his people
on the inside

30:18.483 --> 30:22.487
or buying the loyalty
of those already there.

30:22.570 --> 30:25.365
-Do you believe he turned one of ours?
-No.

30:25.448 --> 30:27.534
They know the consequences of betrayal.

30:30.495 --> 30:31.496
Still, it's...

30:32.539 --> 30:33.581
troubling.

30:35.750 --> 30:38.169
Can't stay angry forever, you know.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.840
-I'm not so sure about that.
-I only misled you

30:41.923 --> 30:44.676
because I wanted you
to have some resolution.

30:44.759 --> 30:45.844
It didn't help.

30:45.927 --> 30:49.097
-Yeah, but I tried.
-No. You lied.

30:49.180 --> 30:52.767
-You made up an elaborate story--
-It wasn't all a story.

30:52.851 --> 30:56.813
Enough of it was,
because not you, nor Ilya Koslov,

30:56.896 --> 30:59.774
nor Raymond Reddington want me
to know what you know.

30:59.858 --> 31:00.942

31:06.406 --> 31:10.618
Transport is moving unimpeded west
through Catharpin on highway 234.

31:10.702 --> 31:13.288
What's this? The truck approaching
Reddington's warehouse.

31:13.371 --> 31:15.415

Team Bravo, you have eyes?

31:15.498 --> 31:18.334

-Just enjoy the ride. Try and relax.

Hey. How's big brother feeling today?

Soon as you got behind the wheel,
I thought you were up to something.

32:19.646 --> 32:23.024
I gave you a chance, Dom,
just like I gave Reddington chances.

32:23.107 --> 32:25.026
<i>I gave him seven years' worth of chances.</i>

32:25.109 --> 32:27.654
I had good reasons
for telling you what I told you.

Oh, so help me God,
if another person in my life

32:30.323 --> 32:32.533
tells me they lied to me
for my own protection...

You don't understand the position I'm in.

-It's a setup.

33:04.899 --> 33:08.903
We need to get off this highway.
There's a turnoff about half a mile ahead.

33:09.570 --> 33:13.199
I'll be gone by then.
But don't worry. Dom will be safe.

33:14.242 --> 33:15.702
<i>She promised me that much.</i>

33:17.161 --> 33:18.621
Elizabeth, what have you done?

33:49.527 --> 33:51.988
[Clemons] Everything will be okay.
Just breathe.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.286
[Park] <i>We've been conned.</i>

33:58.369 --> 34:00.913
-Us and Mr. Reddington.
-But not Keen. She did the con.

34:00.997 --> 34:03.124
-She and Katarina.
-It all makes sense now.

34:03.207 --> 34:06.294
Why Katarina wanted Reddington
to think she was going after Roanoke.

34:06.377 --> 34:09.422
-Why she wanted him on the Blacklist.
-Except there is no Roanoke.

34:09.505 --> 34:11.591
Just a shell of a man living in hospice.

34:11.674 --> 34:14.010
Katarina couldn't hire him,
so she imitated him.

34:14.093 --> 34:16.012
Had her people abduct Lev Pasternak,

34:16.095 --> 34:19.182
then leave bread crumbs to make
Reddington believe it was Roanoke.

34:19.265 --> 34:22.185
She wanted us to believe
he was still active, that she hired him

34:22.268 --> 34:23.811
to get Dom out of that warehouse.

34:23.895 --> 34:27.565
A tactic designed to scare us,
which only made him more vulnerable.

34:27.648 --> 34:30.526
So, you know, kudos to us.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.677
<i>You refused to give them.</i>

34:56.761 --> 34:59.013
What I've given her is an education...

on how people think...

35:02.809 --> 35:03.726
what they want...

35:05.728 --> 35:07.897
and what they're willing to do to get it.

35:08.439 --> 35:12.568
We'll find her, but not so she can
continue her "education."

35:13.653 --> 35:15.696
We'll do it
because we're concerned about her

35:16.280 --> 35:17.824
and because she broke the law.

35:18.366 --> 35:20.868
I'm angry with Agent Keen,
but I'm livid with you.

35:21.869 --> 35:26.707
Seven years ago,
she was kind, enthusiastic, decent.

35:27.708 --> 35:30.878
Under your tutelage, she's become
someone I fail to recognize.

her destiny.

35:48.563 --> 35:49.772
We will get her back.

-This is an internal matter now.

It may not be welcome,
but it is most definitely required.

With all due respect, sir,
isn't this a bit of an overreaction?

-To abduction?
-Of her grandfather.

36:26.017 --> 36:28.019

I don't want to either.

But Agent Keen has betrayed this agency
as well as everyone in this room.

what you tell us, but personally...

to go after Roanoke.

-And Dom?
