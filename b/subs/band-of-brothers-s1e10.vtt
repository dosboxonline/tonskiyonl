Winters:
<i>It was more than three years</i>
<i>since Lewis Nixon and I</i>

03:08.146 --> 03:10.440
<i>decided to join</i>
<i>the Paratroops,</i>

03:10.523 --> 03:13.568
<i>and more than a year since</i>
<i>we'd first gone to war,</i>

03:13.651 --> 03:16.154
<i>not knowing what</i>
<i>would happen to us,</i>

03:16.237 --> 03:19.157
<i>how long</i>
<i>we'd be fighting,</i>

03:19.240 --> 03:21.075
<i>where we'd end up.</i>

03:21.159 --> 03:23.786
<i>I certainly didn't</i>
<i>expect to find myself</i>

03:23.870 --> 03:26.289
<i>in a place like this.</i>

03:29.083 --> 03:32.295
Nixon:
I thought it
might be you.

03:35.381 --> 03:36.799
'Morning.

03:36.883 --> 03:41.304
I heard reports about
a red-headed Eskimo.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.474
Thought I'd
check it out.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.310
Come to join me
for a morning swim?

03:47.393 --> 03:49.062
(laughing)

03:49.145 --> 03:50.438
Yeah.

03:50.521 --> 03:53.107
You know me
so well.

03:53.191 --> 03:56.235
Here,
it's from Zielinski.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.405
Oh, great.

04:03.576 --> 04:04.953
What is that?

04:05.036 --> 04:06.955
Ran into the regimental
photographer.

04:07.038 --> 04:10.959
Said he had
all these photographs
of the 506th

04:11.042 --> 04:14.504
going all the way
back to Toccoa.

04:14.587 --> 04:17.507
I traded 'em for
a couple of lugers.

04:17.590 --> 04:20.051
That's a bargain.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.886
(laughs)

04:30.395 --> 04:32.689
What do you think
you'll do after this?

04:32.772 --> 04:34.691
Get some breakfast.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.487
No, after, after.

04:44.325 --> 04:46.244
Well, it's funny
you should mention it

04:46.327 --> 04:48.454
'cause I had a meeting
with Colonel Sink.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.623
Really?

04:50.707 --> 04:52.291
Yeah.

04:52.375 --> 04:55.962
Yeah, discussed
the possibility
of staying.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.047
In the army?

04:58.131 --> 05:00.008
Yeah.

05:00.091 --> 05:03.469
Yeah, as a career.

05:05.221 --> 05:06.389
What'd you say?

05:06.472 --> 05:09.809
I said I'd
think about it.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.695
What do you think
about New Jersey?

05:20.778 --> 05:22.905
New Jersey?

05:22.989 --> 05:25.408
There's a company
in Nixon, New Jersey.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.577
It's called
"Nixon Nitration Works".

05:27.660 --> 05:28.870
Oh, sounds picturesque.

05:28.953 --> 05:32.665
Yeah, well, oddly enough,
I know the owners.

05:32.749 --> 05:36.544
Probably gonna expect me
to make something of myself.

05:36.627 --> 05:40.214
I thought maybe
I'd drag you with me.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.971
Are you offering
me a job?

05:50.058 --> 05:52.477
We'll see how you do
in your interview,

05:52.560 --> 05:55.104
but, you know, a man
of your qualifications,

05:55.188 --> 05:57.815
I think we can probably
scrape something up

05:57.899 --> 06:00.610
commensurate with
your current salary level.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.741
Yeah, I'll think
about it.

06:09.494 --> 06:13.122
Yeah, I really
appreciate it.

06:13.206 --> 06:17.293
Yeah, just
think about it.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.588
Yeah.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.080
Winters:
<i>Job offers...</i>

06:54.163 --> 06:56.457
<i>hard to fathom.</i>

06:56.541 --> 06:58.835
<i>And the war</i>
<i>wasn't even over.</i>

06:58.918 --> 07:04.215
<i>I was still</i>
<i>getting used to hot showers</i>
<i>and morning swims.</i>

07:14.976 --> 07:17.311
<i>We'd entered Bavaria</i>
<i>in early May</i>

07:17.395 --> 07:19.856
<i>with the hopes</i>
<i>of capturing Berchtesgaden.</i>

07:19.939 --> 07:22.316
<i>This famous town,</i>
<i>high in the Alps,</i>

07:22.400 --> 07:25.153
<i>was the Nazi Party's</i>
<i>symbolic home,</i>

07:25.236 --> 07:28.156
<i>and all the heads</i>
<i>of the Third Reich</i>
<i>had houses there.</i>

07:28.239 --> 07:30.324
<i>Although Hitler</i>
<i>was dead,</i>

07:30.408 --> 07:33.327
<i>he had apparently</i>
<i>ordered the SS to make it</i>
<i>their last stand</i>

07:33.411 --> 07:35.454
<i>from which to mount</i>
<i>a guerrilla resistance</i>

07:35.538 --> 07:37.165
<i>against the Allied advance.</i>

07:37.248 --> 07:40.626
<i>The first step was</i>
<i>blocking the roads.</i>

07:46.132 --> 07:48.634
When are we expecting
the engineers to arrive?

07:48.718 --> 07:50.052
Half an hour ago.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.762
We're stuck here
until they do, Nix.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.806
Well, if you're the SS,

07:53.890 --> 07:56.267
you're not gonna let us
waltz into Hitler's house.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.603
Probably throw
a few rocks at us yourself.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.897
If you're looking for someone
to find another way
up that mountain,

08:00.980 --> 08:02.940
"Easy Company"
is ready and willing.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.940
Duly noted.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.109
I already recommended you
to Colonel Sink.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.612
Terrific, let's go find out
where Hitler lived.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.989
Ron, we're not sure
what's up there.

08:10.072 --> 08:12.658
The colonel doesn't want us
taking any unnecessary risks.

08:12.742 --> 08:17.038
So, the French
are gonna beat us
to the Eagle's Nest.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.720
Colonel Sink: Kids,
I just had a conversation
with General Leclerc.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.639
He told me
he was first into Paris

08:34.722 --> 08:37.141
and, by God, he wanted to be
first into Berchtesgaden.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.521
Told him I understood
his point.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.567
Now, you fire up
Second Battalion

08:46.651 --> 08:48.569
and outflank that
French son of a bitch.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.279
Yes, sir.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.826
I want "Easy Company"
in the lead.

08:55.910 --> 08:58.246
Have the men assemble
down on the Autobahn.

08:58.329 --> 08:59.497
Yes, sir.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.536
Eerie.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.663
Not even
any natives.

09:40.746 --> 09:43.124
That's 'cause this
is the one town

09:43.207 --> 09:45.876
you can't deny
being a true Nazi.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.169
What do you mean?

09:47.253 --> 09:48.963
Nixon:
Well, you have to be
to live here.

09:49.046 --> 09:52.133
Need to find some place
we can put the colonel.

09:52.216 --> 09:55.303
How about
right there?

10:23.914 --> 10:25.916
No, no.

10:47.396 --> 10:49.190
Wow.

10:49.273 --> 10:51.400
(silverware clanging)

10:59.033 --> 11:00.868
Kitty would
love this.

11:00.951 --> 11:05.164
How many brides
get a wedding present
from Hitler?

11:08.167 --> 11:10.586
You wanna
take half?

11:10.669 --> 11:12.254
I can't carry
all this.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.382
You know, whoever
comes in here after us

11:14.465 --> 11:16.425
is gonna take whatever
isn't nailed down.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.428
Well, wouldn't want
that to happen.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.805
(chuckles)

11:24.850 --> 11:25.935
Nice.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.771
Don't even
think about it.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.949
Major Winters?
Sir?

11:40.032 --> 11:41.367
More.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.494
Er, permission to climb
the mountain, sir?

11:43.577 --> 11:45.830
The Eagle's Nest?

11:43.577 --> 11:45.830
What is this?

11:45.913 --> 11:47.456
Wait one minute.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.668
Harry, have "F" Company
put a double guard
on the hotel.

11:50.751 --> 11:52.795
Set up roadblocks
on the west side of town.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.673
I want battalion HQ,
seal off the north side

11:55.756 --> 11:57.550
and prepare
for prisoners.

11:57.633 --> 11:58.801
Sergeant Grant.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.971
And, Harry,
nobody gets hurt, not now.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.472
(ripping)

12:03.556 --> 12:05.641
And "Easy"?

12:07.226 --> 12:09.061
"Easy" will head
up the mountain

12:09.145 --> 12:13.566
through the Obersalzburg
and take the Eagle's Nest.

12:15.693 --> 12:18.612
Man:
Hi-ho, Silver!

12:18.696 --> 12:20.614
(yelling)

12:23.200 --> 12:25.828
(all cheering)

12:25.911 --> 12:29.248
Winters:<i> The Eagle's Nest</i>
<i>was a surprise birthday</i>
<i>present for Hitler,</i>

12:29.331 --> 12:31.292
<i>built with</i>
<i>Nazi Party money.</i>

12:31.375 --> 12:34.545
<i>A mountaintop stone retreat</i>
<i>8,000 feet up,</i>

12:34.628 --> 12:37.339
<i>accessible</i>
<i>by a gold-plated elevator.</i>

12:37.423 --> 12:40.676
<i>It was one</i>
<i>of the crown jewels</i>
<i>of his empire.</i>

12:40.759 --> 12:43.304
<i>And the man</i>
<i>was afraid of heights.</i>

13:24.595 --> 13:26.680
(cork popping)

13:29.350 --> 13:31.393
Here's to him.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.743
(man laughing)

13:44.949 --> 13:47.743
Nixon: No, God damn it,
listen.

13:47.826 --> 13:49.828
"Hitler, Hitler"-- no.

13:49.912 --> 13:54.875
Man:
Hitler, Himmler,
Goering, Goebbels!

13:54.959 --> 13:56.794
(all arguing)

13:59.505 --> 14:03.175
Hey, Adolf!
Love your Eagle's Nest.

14:03.259 --> 14:06.262
I hope you don't mind.
We made ourselves
at home.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.389
Love what you've done
with the place.

14:08.472 --> 14:10.140
Hey, hey,
have a drink.

14:10.224 --> 14:13.519
Come on.
Just so's as we can say
we saw you do it.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.145
Listen up.

14:15.229 --> 14:18.190
From Corps, just came in.
Effective immediately.

14:18.274 --> 14:22.611
"All troops stand fast
on present positions."

14:23.779 --> 14:25.364
Standing fast.

14:23.779 --> 14:25.364
Yeah.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.491
(chuckling)

14:27.575 --> 14:29.243
Wanna hear it?

14:27.575 --> 14:29.243
Mmm.

14:29.326 --> 14:30.244
Mmm-hmm?

14:30.327 --> 14:32.162
Ready for it?
Listen up.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.081
German army's
surrendered.

14:41.255 --> 14:44.300
I got a present
for you. Come on.

14:45.593 --> 14:48.345
Is it?

14:45.593 --> 14:48.345
Yeah.

15:07.823 --> 15:09.950
Nixon:
What is this place?

15:10.034 --> 15:12.494
Hermann Goering's house.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.954
We discovered it
yesterday.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.998
Had it on double guard
ever since.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.458
I can vouch
for that, sir.

15:17.541 --> 15:19.126
Oh, anxious to get
off duty, O'Keefe?

15:19.209 --> 15:21.629
No, there's just so much
to see and do, sir.

15:57.247 --> 16:00.042
Winters:
<i>10,000 bottles</i>
<i>of the world's finest liquor,</i>

16:00.125 --> 16:03.212
<i>wine, and champagne helped</i>
<i>"Easy Company" mark the day</i>

16:03.295 --> 16:05.756
<i>the war in Europe</i>
<i>came to an end.</i>

16:05.839 --> 16:08.342
Winters:
It's all yours.

16:08.425 --> 16:11.303
Take what you want
and have each company
take a truckload.

16:11.387 --> 16:14.723
We're heading for Austria
in the morning,

16:14.807 --> 16:16.558
but don't feel
you have to leave
anything here

16:16.642 --> 16:18.644
for whoever comes next.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.644
Austria, sir?

16:18.727 --> 16:21.021
Happy V.E. Day.

16:21.105 --> 16:22.564
Yeah.

16:23.774 --> 16:25.776
V.E. Day?

16:25.859 --> 16:28.654
Victory in Europe.

16:36.704 --> 16:39.456
Happy V.E. Day.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.460
Winters:
<i>Instead of an aggressive</i>
<i>combat unit,</i>

16:43.544 --> 16:45.421
<i>we became</i>
<i>an occupation force.</i>

16:45.504 --> 16:47.881
<i>And no one wanted</i>
<i>to leave Berchtesgaden</i>

16:47.965 --> 16:50.259
<i>until they saw Austria.</i>

17:26.587 --> 17:30.632
So, you reckon they'll make us
run up those or ski down them?

17:46.356 --> 17:49.610
(people cheering,
calling out)

17:49.693 --> 17:51.779
Soldier:
Hey, how are you?

17:51.862 --> 17:54.448
Need a hand there?
Hi, hi!

17:54.531 --> 17:56.492
He loves you!

17:56.575 --> 18:00.037
Hey, lady,
how are you?

18:02.372 --> 18:06.168
I think the war is over!

18:38.242 --> 18:41.328
We'll be
comfortable here.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.792
I wonder what
will happen to us,

18:46.875 --> 18:49.211
to people like
you and me,

18:49.294 --> 18:53.674
when there are finally
no more wars to occupy us.

18:56.844 --> 18:59.429
Have all your men
collect the weapons,

18:59.513 --> 19:01.849
deposit them at the church,
at the school,

19:01.932 --> 19:04.601
and at the airfield.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.601
Very well.

19:12.192 --> 19:15.070
Please accept this
as my formal surrender,
Major.

19:15.153 --> 19:18.740
It is better than to lay it
on the desk of a clerk.

19:27.040 --> 19:29.668
You may keep
your sidearm, Colonel.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.602
Male announcer:
<i>Heroic dead of a combined</i>
<i>army and Marine force</i>

19:46.685 --> 19:49.021
<i>mark the grim battlefield</i>
<i>of Okinawa,</i>

19:49.104 --> 19:51.732
<i>where one of</i>
<i>the bloodiest engagements</i>
<i>of the war is being fought.</i>

19:51.815 --> 19:54.902
<i>Thousands of Yanks</i>
<i>have been wounded...</i>

19:54.985 --> 19:56.862
Look sharp.

19:59.907 --> 20:03.869
<i>Along the Jap's</i>
<i>southern defense line,</i>
<i>the Yanks progress slowly,</i>

20:03.952 --> 20:06.914
<i>facing one of</i>
<i>the fiercest artillery</i>
<i>barrages of the war.</i>

20:06.997 --> 20:09.625
<i>Each small advance</i>
<i>is gained by sheer grit</i>

20:09.708 --> 20:13.170
<i>in the face of withering fire</i>
<i>from a suicidal enemy</i>

20:13.253 --> 20:16.423
<i>being slowly hammered</i>
<i>back into the hills.</i>

20:16.506 --> 20:18.592
<i>The going is brutal</i>
<i>and our casualties are high,</i>

20:18.675 --> 20:22.429
<i>but Okinawa</i>
<i>is the next big step</i>
<i>towards victory over Japan--</i>

20:22.512 --> 20:24.765
<i>a victory that</i>
<i>can only be won by work,</i>

20:24.848 --> 20:28.602
<i>war bonds,</i>
<i>and heroic sacrifice.</i>

20:35.984 --> 20:37.819
So, when are we going?

20:37.903 --> 20:39.863
We don't have
a date yet.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.823
Are we to tell
the men right away?

20:41.907 --> 20:44.868
Some of them
will have enough points
to go home instead.

20:44.952 --> 20:48.163
Not many,
if their only medal's
a Purple Heart.

20:48.246 --> 20:51.583
I think most of us here
will have enough.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.544
And each of us
will have to decide
what to do.

20:54.628 --> 20:57.214
I don't know how long
we're waiting here for orders,

20:57.297 --> 20:59.841
but I want those veterans
who are staying

20:59.925 --> 21:02.260
and all new replacements
ready to fight.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.471
That means
rifle ranges.

21:04.554 --> 21:07.015
That means daily
close-order drills.
That means troop reviews.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.393
But, above all, it means
physical training.

21:09.476 --> 21:12.396
Get your NCOs on it.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.565
They're gonna
love you.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.488
What are you crouching
down for, Perco?

21:21.571 --> 21:23.949
Think the deer's
gonna shoot back?

21:24.032 --> 21:25.951
Leave me alone.

21:26.034 --> 21:28.328
How about y'all
just shut up

21:28.412 --> 21:30.288
and let Shifty
kill us some dinner?

21:30.372 --> 21:31.915
Perconte:
Ah, what's
the matter, Bull?

21:31.999 --> 21:35.335
You tired
of eating dried-up spuds
three times a day?

21:35.419 --> 21:37.087
Hey, you know what,
I got an idea--

21:37.170 --> 21:39.381
why don't we
just shoot Bull here

21:39.464 --> 21:41.049
and feed the company
for a week?

21:41.133 --> 21:43.301
(twig snaps)

22:04.573 --> 22:07.117
(gun clicks)

22:08.452 --> 22:10.579
Aw, God damn it,
Shifty.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.372
You let him
get away.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.541
Army oughta be glad
to be rid of you.

22:14.624 --> 22:16.918
I wish, you know.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.087
It seems they want me
to stay around awhile.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.130
Are you serious?

22:20.213 --> 22:22.507
How many points
you need?
15.

22:22.591 --> 22:25.927
15? Jesus Christ,
I thought I had it bad.

22:26.011 --> 22:29.222
Mmm. No Purple Hearts,
never was injured.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.099
Man:
Company!

22:31.183 --> 22:32.434
All:
Platoon!

22:32.517 --> 22:35.228
Atten-tion!

22:38.023 --> 22:40.817
Right shoulder.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.986
Arm!

22:44.738 --> 22:46.865
Order.

22:46.948 --> 22:48.408
Arms!

22:50.702 --> 22:52.537
At ease.

22:54.539 --> 22:57.459
General Taylor is aware
that many veterans,

22:57.542 --> 22:59.336
including
Normandy veterans,

22:59.419 --> 23:02.506
still do not have
the 85 points required
to be discharged.

23:02.589 --> 23:04.758
On this,
the anniversary of D-Day,

23:04.841 --> 23:06.802
he has authorized
a lottery to send

23:06.885 --> 23:09.346
one man home
in each company,

23:09.429 --> 23:11.223
effective immediately.

23:11.306 --> 23:15.685
For "Easy Company",
the winner is...

23:21.650 --> 23:23.026
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

23:24.736 --> 23:27.781
Serial number
1-3-0...

23:27.864 --> 23:29.616
6-6-2-6-6.

23:29.699 --> 23:33.245
Sergeant
Darrell C. Powers.

23:33.328 --> 23:35.038
Well done, Shifty.

23:35.122 --> 23:38.333
That's how
it's done, Shifty!

23:40.127 --> 23:42.337
Congratulations,
Shifty.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.548
Sergeant Grant
will see to it
that 2nd platoon

23:44.631 --> 23:46.675
takes over
at the Crossroads checkpoint,

23:46.758 --> 23:49.302
beginning tonight
at 2200 hours.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.346
So much for
our anniversary.

23:51.429 --> 23:52.681
No shit.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.224
General Taylor
has also announced that

23:54.307 --> 23:55.809
the 101st Airborne Division

23:55.892 --> 23:59.312
will definitely be
redeployed to the Pacific.

24:00.897 --> 24:04.651
So, beginning tomorrow,
at 0600 hours,

24:04.734 --> 24:07.487
we will begin
training to go to war.

24:13.410 --> 24:16.496
(knocking)

24:13.410 --> 24:16.496
Come in.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.415
(door opening)

24:23.295 --> 24:25.797
I don't mean to
interrupt you, sir.

24:25.881 --> 24:30.010
I just wanted
to say goodbye.

24:30.093 --> 24:33.263
You know, you was...

24:34.681 --> 24:37.976
You was...

24:38.059 --> 24:39.895
Well...

24:39.978 --> 24:42.606
it's been
a long time.

24:43.773 --> 24:46.359
You got everything
you need?

24:46.443 --> 24:48.778
Yes, sir.
I gathered up my loot.

24:48.862 --> 24:50.363
Pistols mainly.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.407
Paperwork's all done.

24:52.490 --> 24:55.076
I even got my back pay
in my pocket.

25:00.248 --> 25:04.002
Back, back home
in Virginia...

25:05.837 --> 25:08.340
well...

25:10.258 --> 25:14.304
I just don't rightly know
how I'm gonna explain
all this.

25:18.642 --> 25:21.603
You see, I've...

25:21.686 --> 25:24.064
I've seen...

25:24.147 --> 25:25.565
I've seen...

25:25.649 --> 25:29.736
You're a hell
of a fine soldier,
Shifty.

25:29.819 --> 25:33.031
There's nothing more
to explain.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.827
Thank you, sir.

25:45.669 --> 25:48.213
Winters:
<i>Two days later,</i>
<i>Shifty Powers</i>

25:48.296 --> 25:51.049
<i>was on a truck</i>
<i>headed for the rear</i>
<i>and a boat home.</i>

25:51.132 --> 25:53.468
<i>Unfortunately the truck</i>
<i>was hit head-on</i>

25:53.551 --> 25:56.554
<i>by a drunken corporal</i>
<i>from another regiment.</i>

25:56.638 --> 25:58.306
<i>Shifty had</i>
<i>a broken pelvis,</i>

25:58.390 --> 26:00.976
<i>a broken arm,</i>
<i>and a bad concussion.</i>

26:01.059 --> 26:03.270
<i>He survived,</i>
<i>but had to spend</i>
<i>the next few months</i>

26:03.353 --> 26:05.438
<i>in a series</i>
<i>of hospitals.</i>

26:05.522 --> 26:08.358
<i>I wish I could say</i>
<i>that he was our only casualty</i>
<i>in Austria.</i>

26:08.441 --> 26:10.610
I've made up
my mind, Nix.

26:10.694 --> 26:13.196
I got the points,
I'm going back to Kitty.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.907
Harry, do you really think
that Kitty hasn't run off

26:15.991 --> 26:17.909
with some 4-F by now?

26:15.991 --> 26:17.909
(laughs)

26:17.993 --> 26:21.079
Son of a bitch.
That's not even funny.

26:21.162 --> 26:23.290
Harry, ignore him.

26:23.373 --> 26:24.916
How am I supposed
to tell her

26:25.000 --> 26:27.294
I had the chance
to come home to her
finally,

26:27.377 --> 26:29.671
but decided not to,
so I could go jump
on Tokyo?

26:29.754 --> 26:32.841
All right,
so don't tell her.

26:32.924 --> 26:35.635
Besides, she's waited for you
for three years, right?

26:35.719 --> 26:38.680
We'll be to Tokyo and back
in two years, three tops.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.890
It'll probably be over
before you even get there.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.310
You know, the reality
is you're gonna sit here
in Austria

26:43.393 --> 26:45.186
for six months
waiting to go

26:45.270 --> 26:47.439
and I'm gonna be back
in Wilkes-Barre making babies.

26:47.522 --> 26:48.857
You didn't
tell him?

26:48.940 --> 26:50.483
No, I couldn't get
him to shut up.

26:50.567 --> 26:53.320
What? Tell me what?

26:53.403 --> 26:58.366
Guts and Glory here
applied for a transfer.

26:53.403 --> 26:58.366
What?

26:58.450 --> 27:01.995
13th Airborne are heading out
for the Pacific right away.

27:04.956 --> 27:08.251
If I'm going,
I wanna get it over with.

27:10.420 --> 27:12.255
Are you in
on this too?

27:12.339 --> 27:14.674
I can't let him
go by himself.

27:14.758 --> 27:17.469
He doesn't know
where it is.

27:18.553 --> 27:20.930
You're leaving
the men?

27:22.557 --> 27:24.809
They don't need me
anymore.

27:35.945 --> 27:37.864
Wounded in Normandy?

27:37.947 --> 27:39.282
Yes, sir.

27:39.366 --> 27:41.159
In the leg.
It was a minor
flesh wound.

27:41.242 --> 27:44.537
Company "E"
lost 24 men killed there.

27:44.621 --> 27:46.164
Yes, sir.

27:46.247 --> 27:48.792
17 of those were in
my company commander's plane.

27:48.875 --> 27:51.294
It went down
on D-Day.

27:51.378 --> 27:54.798
So you were given command
of the company on D-Day?

27:54.881 --> 27:57.008
That's right.

27:58.510 --> 28:02.597
(bullets whizzing)

28:06.101 --> 28:08.937
Fall back
to your original positions!

28:09.020 --> 28:13.400
Everyone else maintain
your pace of fire!

28:21.574 --> 28:24.244
In Holland...

28:24.327 --> 28:27.664
they bumped you
to battalion XO.

28:27.747 --> 28:29.791
Yes, sir.

28:33.628 --> 28:37.715
Bastards took
your company away.

28:39.926 --> 28:43.263
(phone ringing)

28:55.733 --> 28:57.694
(firing)

29:00.530 --> 29:02.907
(ringing)

29:04.868 --> 29:07.620
I fired
my last shots there.

29:07.704 --> 29:10.415
For the whole damn war?

29:10.498 --> 29:13.668
Yes, sir.

29:15.462 --> 29:18.173
You got through Bastogne
without having to fire
your weapon?

29:18.256 --> 29:20.175
That is correct, sir.

29:20.258 --> 29:23.094
And you were on the line
the whole time?

29:23.178 --> 29:25.013
Yes, sir.

29:27.307 --> 29:29.851
Can't imagine a tougher
test for a leader,

29:29.934 --> 29:33.313
having to sit through
a siege like that

29:33.396 --> 29:35.940
under those
conditions.

29:36.024 --> 29:38.193
We got through it.

29:38.276 --> 29:41.070
Find some cover!
Find a foxhole!

29:41.154 --> 29:42.947
Come on,
take cover!

29:43.031 --> 29:46.242
Take cover!

29:50.288 --> 29:53.249
Come on,
find some cover!

29:56.294 --> 29:58.880
So why do you
want a transfer?

29:58.963 --> 30:00.215
Sorry, sir?

30:00.298 --> 30:03.301
I said, why do you want
to leave your men?

30:03.384 --> 30:04.886
Oh, it's not that, sir.

30:04.969 --> 30:07.347
It's just that if the war
was still on in the Pacific

30:07.430 --> 30:09.307
and I could do some
good over there...

30:09.390 --> 30:12.519
Looking to have
your own division someday?

30:12.602 --> 30:13.811
No, sir.

30:13.895 --> 30:16.314
Not going to make
a career of the army?

30:16.397 --> 30:17.690
No.

30:17.774 --> 30:21.486
Ye-- I--
Well, I don't know, sir.

30:21.569 --> 30:23.863
Because if you think
you need more combat
experience

30:23.947 --> 30:26.533
to get stars
on your helmet,

30:26.616 --> 30:29.744
let me tell you
something, son--

30:29.827 --> 30:32.163
you've done enough.

30:34.499 --> 30:36.125
Thank you, sir.

30:36.209 --> 30:38.127
That's--
that's not my objective.

30:44.676 --> 30:47.262
Major,
I took this meeting

30:47.345 --> 30:49.764
out of respect
for your achievements,

30:49.847 --> 30:52.058
and for the 101st.

30:52.141 --> 30:55.270
If they do go to
the Pacific eventually,

30:55.353 --> 30:59.107
you should be running
one of the battalions.

31:00.984 --> 31:03.236
Thank you, sir.

31:03.319 --> 31:05.989
And frankly, I think
your men have earned

31:06.072 --> 31:09.367
the right
to keep you around.

31:13.997 --> 31:16.040
Yes, sir.

31:16.124 --> 31:18.960
Thank you, sir.

31:23.548 --> 31:26.968
Winters:
<i>So, I would stay in Austria</i>
<i>for the time being,</i>

31:27.051 --> 31:28.678
<i>waiting for orders,</i>

31:28.761 --> 31:30.805
<i>and trying to</i>
<i>watch over soldiers</i>

31:30.888 --> 31:33.057
<i>who had no enemy</i>
<i>to fight.</i>

31:33.141 --> 31:34.559
Lieb, I fucking
hate this.

31:34.642 --> 31:37.145
Oh, Jesus Christ,
they fingered him.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.896
He was in
the fucking room, Web.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.648
One of those Polacks
who was at the slave camps

31:40.732 --> 31:42.567
said this is where
the guy lives, right here.

31:42.650 --> 31:44.694
Which camp?

31:42.650 --> 31:44.694
Whatever camp.

31:44.777 --> 31:48.948
I'm under direct orders
and I'm happy to follow it.

32:08.635 --> 32:10.720
Is this a personal
thing, Joe?

32:10.803 --> 32:11.804
What?

32:11.888 --> 32:13.765
Is this personal
to you?

32:13.848 --> 32:15.600
No, it's
a goddamn order.

32:15.683 --> 32:18.311
Does Major Winters
know about this?

32:18.394 --> 32:19.520
Doesn't matter here.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.105
Oh, the fuck
it doesn't.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.774
What if this guy's
just a soldier?

32:22.857 --> 32:25.026
What if he's an officer
with no ties to the SS?

32:25.109 --> 32:26.986
What if he's innocent?

32:25.109 --> 32:26.986
You know what?

32:27.070 --> 32:29.280
What if he's
a fucking Nazi commandant
of a fucking slave camp?

32:29.364 --> 32:30.782
Which one?
Which camp?

32:30.865 --> 32:33.576
You don't have any proof.

32:30.865 --> 32:33.576
Were you at Landsberg?

32:33.660 --> 32:35.244
You know I was.

32:35.328 --> 32:37.997
You think he's a soldier
like you and me?

32:38.081 --> 32:41.167
A fucking innocent
German officer?

32:41.250 --> 32:46.172
Where the hell have you been
for the past three years?

32:48.508 --> 32:52.095
<i>Wer sind sie?</i>
<i>Was machen sie hier?</i>

32:52.178 --> 32:53.513
What?

32:53.596 --> 32:55.848
<i>Ich habe garnichts.</i>

32:53.596 --> 32:55.848
Shut up.

32:55.932 --> 32:58.184
<i>Was machen sie?</i>

32:55.932 --> 32:58.184
<i>Ruhe.</i>

32:58.267 --> 33:00.603
<i>Sie sind</i>
<i>der Kommandant.</i>

33:00.687 --> 33:02.063
<i>Gehen sie heraus.</i>

33:02.146 --> 33:03.606
<i>Sie sind</i>
<i>der Kommandant.</i>

33:03.690 --> 33:04.816
<i>Welcher Kommandant?</i>

33:04.899 --> 33:06.192
<i>Vom Arbeitslager.</i>

33:06.275 --> 33:07.652
<i>Ich weiss von keinem</i>
<i>Arbeitslager.</i>

33:07.735 --> 33:09.445
<i>Sie haben</i>
<i>die falsche Person.</i>

33:09.529 --> 33:10.738
No?

33:10.822 --> 33:12.448
Come here,
old man.

33:12.532 --> 33:13.533
<i>Nein, nein.</i>

33:13.616 --> 33:15.576
Don't fucking
lie to me.

33:15.660 --> 33:16.869
<i>Sie tauschen sich.</i>

33:16.953 --> 33:20.039
See what you did
to my fucking people?

33:20.123 --> 33:22.208
<i>Nein. Nein!</i>

33:22.291 --> 33:24.669
(yelling continues)

33:49.318 --> 33:51.946
He's guilty.

33:53.281 --> 33:54.949
Liebgott says so.

33:55.032 --> 33:57.201
He probably is.

33:57.285 --> 33:59.370
(gunshot)

33:57.285 --> 33:59.370
(man shouts)

34:04.333 --> 34:05.960
(clicking)

34:06.043 --> 34:07.253
Goddamn son of a bitch.

34:07.336 --> 34:08.421
Shoot him.

34:09.672 --> 34:11.924
Shoot him!

34:09.672 --> 34:11.924
No.

34:13.468 --> 34:16.387
(gunshot)

34:34.697 --> 34:37.450
Officers don't run.

34:37.533 --> 34:40.495
The war's over,
anybody would run.

34:41.996 --> 34:44.832
Winters:
<i>Summer in this alpine</i>
<i>paradise</i>

34:44.916 --> 34:47.001
<i>should have been</i>
<i>a welcome relief,</i>

34:47.085 --> 34:50.004
<i>especially now that we were</i>
<i>at peace with the Germans.</i>

34:50.087 --> 34:51.923
<i>Everyone just wanted</i>
<i>to go home.</i>

34:52.006 --> 34:54.801
France.
France was the best.

34:54.884 --> 34:56.010
Really?

34:56.094 --> 34:58.471
Yeah, five years.

34:58.554 --> 35:02.683
I think
I was in every country,
but France was the best.

35:06.938 --> 35:09.941
Italy would be
second for me.

35:10.024 --> 35:12.610
Russia
is not desirable.

35:12.693 --> 35:14.904
Ukraine-- it was okay.

35:14.987 --> 35:18.658
So, er,
when d'you get out?

35:18.741 --> 35:20.326
The unit is
discharged.

35:20.409 --> 35:22.787
We leave when my captain
gets transferred.

35:22.870 --> 35:25.873
It is the end
of my second war.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.416
Jesus.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.335
I'm going home now
to Mannheim.

35:29.418 --> 35:30.878
I'll take this one.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.755
<i>Passkarte, bitte.</i>

35:34.173 --> 35:37.260
Okay.

35:41.639 --> 35:44.058
Hey, Webster!
My relief.

35:44.141 --> 35:47.103
Don't salute the Germans.

35:44.141 --> 35:47.103
Aw, come on.

35:47.186 --> 35:49.146
I sort of
get a kick out of it.

35:49.230 --> 35:52.316
Anyway, I got me
a new enemy-- the Japs.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.069
75 points.
How about you?

35:55.152 --> 35:57.780
I mean, you're
a Toccoa guy, right?
How many you got?

35:57.864 --> 36:00.199
Wouldn't you
like to know?

36:02.618 --> 36:05.371
Discharged, huh?

36:05.454 --> 36:08.499
Go ahead, take off,
it's my turn.

36:08.583 --> 36:11.210
Okay, see you back
at the farm.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.839
81.

36:14.922 --> 36:16.591
Huh?

36:16.674 --> 36:18.509
I have 81 points.

36:18.593 --> 36:22.138
(laughing)
well, that's just
not good enough.

36:24.974 --> 36:27.351
(honking)

36:27.435 --> 36:29.937
See about getting
you a ride.

36:30.938 --> 36:32.607
Hey!

36:32.690 --> 36:33.858
Hey!

36:33.941 --> 36:36.027
Where are they going?

36:33.941 --> 36:36.027
Munich.

36:36.110 --> 36:37.528
<i>Munchen,</i> Munich.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.238
Wanna go to Munich?

36:39.322 --> 36:42.074
<i>Um, mochten sie nach</i>
<i>Munchen gehen?</i>

36:42.158 --> 36:43.534
<i>Ja, bitte.</i>

36:45.411 --> 36:46.913
(speaking softly)

36:46.996 --> 36:50.207
(both yelling in German)

36:50.291 --> 36:52.335
Get in.

36:54.712 --> 36:56.130
Too bad.

37:01.886 --> 37:03.763
Turn the wheel!

37:05.139 --> 37:08.601
(horn honking)

37:05.139 --> 37:08.601
Oh, Jesus.

37:21.197 --> 37:23.574
It's Private Janovec.

37:26.035 --> 37:29.288
He was dead when
they brought him in.

37:32.458 --> 37:35.169
75 points.

37:35.252 --> 37:36.754
What?

37:36.837 --> 37:39.465
He was
10 points short.

37:39.548 --> 37:41.550
Winters:
<i>The enemy had surrendered,</i>

37:41.634 --> 37:44.679
<i>but somehow men</i>
<i>were still dying.</i>

37:44.762 --> 37:47.348
<i>Young men</i>
<i>who wanted to be home</i>
<i>with their families by now,</i>

37:47.431 --> 37:49.809
<i>who'd served with distinction</i>
<i>since before Normandy</i>

37:49.892 --> 37:52.937
<i>were stuck here</i>
<i>because they didn't</i>
<i>have the points.</i>

37:53.020 --> 37:55.940
<i>What they did have</i>
<i>plenty of were weapons,</i>
<i>alcohol,</i>

37:56.023 --> 37:59.235
<i>and too much time</i>
<i>on their hands.</i>

37:59.318 --> 38:01.737
Man:
When all of a sudden,
from out of nowhere,

38:01.821 --> 38:04.740
a guy jumps out
of the hedgerow,
onto this guy's chest,

38:04.824 --> 38:06.909
shoves a trench knife
up against his throat

38:06.993 --> 38:10.413
and screams,
"Whose side are you on?"

38:10.496 --> 38:12.164
I don't get it.

38:12.248 --> 38:13.499
It's D-Day.

38:13.582 --> 38:16.127
It's 2nd Platoon's
own Bill Guarnere.

38:16.210 --> 38:17.795
Ol' Gonorrhea
himself.

38:17.878 --> 38:20.047
Just landed in Normandy
and wound up like
I don't know what.

38:20.131 --> 38:23.092
"Whose side are you on?"
What a fucking character.

38:23.175 --> 38:25.761
What happened
to him?

38:25.845 --> 38:27.930
Got his leg blown off
in Bastogne.

38:29.890 --> 38:31.308
Wait here.

38:36.856 --> 38:40.192
Are you okay, Mac,
d'you need some help?

38:40.276 --> 38:43.404
(laughing)

38:45.239 --> 38:49.452
They wouldn't give me
any gas.

38:49.535 --> 38:51.412
Krauts.

38:56.375 --> 38:58.836
I tried to explain.

39:00.046 --> 39:03.090
This fucking limey
wouldn't listen.

39:04.884 --> 39:07.136
I think he was a major.

39:07.219 --> 39:08.971
Look, private,
we've got a problem here.

39:09.055 --> 39:11.390
Do you have
any gas?

39:11.474 --> 39:13.434
Why don't you
give me your weapon?

39:15.186 --> 39:18.147
Well, I guess
I'll just use his jeep.

39:18.230 --> 39:20.274
I don't think
he's gonna be needing it.

39:20.357 --> 39:21.901
Hold on a second there,
all right?

39:21.984 --> 39:23.027
(fires)

39:24.320 --> 39:26.906
Jesus. Sarge!

39:26.989 --> 39:29.075
Sergeant Grant!

39:31.327 --> 39:34.038
Sarge!

39:39.627 --> 39:42.254
Jesus.

39:42.338 --> 39:44.131
What?

39:44.215 --> 39:46.175
He's not gonna
make it.

39:46.258 --> 39:47.760
You can't
operate on him?

39:47.843 --> 39:49.512
Not me.
You'd need
a brain surgeon.

39:49.595 --> 39:53.766
And even if you had one,
I don't think there's
any hope.

39:55.726 --> 39:58.187
You find the shooter,
I want him alive.

39:58.270 --> 39:59.814
Come on, help me.

39:58.270 --> 39:59.814
What are you doing?

39:59.897 --> 40:02.483
We're gonna go
find a brain surgeon.

40:02.566 --> 40:04.443
Get the door.

40:04.527 --> 40:05.778
Hey, Lieb.

40:05.861 --> 40:08.322
He wants a noncom
guarding each roadblock

40:08.405 --> 40:10.407
and at least two men watching
every road out of town.

40:10.491 --> 40:12.243
Bull, Malark,
you each take a squad

40:12.326 --> 40:14.453
and one of these witnesses
on a house-to-house search.

40:14.537 --> 40:16.205
Can we shoot
this bastard on sight?

40:16.288 --> 40:18.249
Try and take
him alive.

40:18.332 --> 40:19.625
Where's Grant now?

40:19.708 --> 40:21.669
They took him
to a kraut hospital

40:21.752 --> 40:24.296
to see if they could
drum up any good doctors.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.340
(knocking)

40:26.423 --> 40:28.592
(dog barking)

40:32.972 --> 40:35.141
Open up.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.813
Come with me.

40:40.896 --> 40:41.856
Why?

40:41.939 --> 40:43.399
Get in the jeep.

40:45.025 --> 40:47.403
Where are we going?

40:47.486 --> 40:49.947
To the hospital,
get in.

40:50.030 --> 40:52.992
If you're going
to shoot me, shoot me.

40:53.075 --> 40:55.327
If you're not,
put the gun away.

40:55.411 --> 40:56.704
Get in the jeep, now.

40:56.787 --> 40:58.414
What happened
to him?

40:58.497 --> 41:01.333
He was shot
in the head.

41:01.417 --> 41:03.711
Half hour ago.

41:03.794 --> 41:05.546
Come on.

41:05.629 --> 41:08.257
If you want him to live,
you'll help me.

41:08.340 --> 41:10.009
First by putting
that away.

41:12.803 --> 41:14.263
Let's go.

41:14.346 --> 41:15.514
Let me drive.

41:15.598 --> 41:18.350
We'll get there faster.

41:27.943 --> 41:30.654
(punching, grunting)

41:30.738 --> 41:33.699
Jesus.
Again, what a hand.

41:33.782 --> 41:36.076
(yelling, grunting
continue)

41:36.160 --> 41:38.662
I don't know who's taking
a bigger beating, me or him.

41:38.746 --> 41:40.915
Wanna play
a different game?

41:38.746 --> 41:40.915
No.

41:40.998 --> 41:44.210
Same game, just shuffle
'em up good, huh?

41:46.086 --> 41:48.047
You all right?

41:48.130 --> 41:50.049
Yeah, I'm all right.

41:50.132 --> 41:52.509
You wanna go in there
and join in?

41:54.553 --> 41:57.056
I should go in there
and stop this.

41:57.139 --> 41:59.934
Floyd, let's just
play cards, all right?

42:06.190 --> 42:07.691
Where is he?

42:07.775 --> 42:08.901
How's Grant?
Where is he?

42:08.984 --> 42:10.736
Is he okay?

42:08.984 --> 42:10.736
Where is he?

42:19.161 --> 42:20.746
(coughing)

42:20.829 --> 42:22.206
This him?

42:23.707 --> 42:24.917
That's him.

42:27.878 --> 42:29.213
Replacement,

42:29.296 --> 42:30.673
"I" company.

42:31.799 --> 42:33.175
Where's the weapon?

42:34.343 --> 42:37.096
What weapon?

42:39.390 --> 42:42.184
When you talk to an officer,
you say "sir."

42:50.359 --> 42:53.570
(gun cocking)

43:32.776 --> 43:36.739
Have the MPs take care
of this piece of shit.

43:37.740 --> 43:39.616
Grant's dead?

43:37.740 --> 43:39.616
No.

43:39.700 --> 43:44.621
Kraut surgeon
says he's gonna make it.

43:48.500 --> 43:50.544
Hey, tough guy,
on your feet.

43:50.627 --> 43:53.922
Come on, move,
move it.

43:54.006 --> 43:56.425
I'm guessing they were
Hitler's photo albums, sir.

43:56.508 --> 43:58.802
Sure had a lot of
pictures of him in it.

43:58.886 --> 44:01.680
So, you looked at 'em,
but you didn't take 'em?

44:01.764 --> 44:03.057
That's right, sir.

44:03.140 --> 44:05.059
I don't believe you.

44:09.688 --> 44:12.775
I'll be watching you.
You're dismissed.

44:16.695 --> 44:19.656
You'd better not
be lying to me.

44:24.286 --> 44:25.829
What?

44:25.913 --> 44:29.708
Sir, if it's not gonna
put you in too much of a bind,

44:29.792 --> 44:33.087
I'd like to resign
as company 1st sergeant.

44:34.546 --> 44:36.090
If I had my choice,

44:36.173 --> 44:38.801
I miss being back
amongst the men.

44:38.884 --> 44:40.803
I'd be happy to go
to staff sergeant,

44:40.886 --> 44:43.430
whichever platoon
you wanna put me in.

44:47.476 --> 44:51.063
Well, I guess you've earned
your right to demote yourself.

44:51.146 --> 44:53.148
Thank you, sir.

44:53.232 --> 44:56.151
You wanna take over
Sergeant Grant's platoon?

44:56.235 --> 44:59.655
That would
do fine, sir.

45:02.491 --> 45:05.702
All right then,
report to Lieutenant Peacock.

45:08.497 --> 45:11.583
Let me know
if he gives you any trouble.

45:13.043 --> 45:15.838
Oh, sir, you make
your decision yet?

45:15.921 --> 45:17.840
Yeah, I did.

45:25.222 --> 45:28.183
So, what else
is on your mind?

45:28.267 --> 45:30.227
I know "Easy Company's"
gonna need

45:30.310 --> 45:32.062
a commanding officer
post-war.

45:32.146 --> 45:34.106
Somebody to
hold their hand,

45:34.189 --> 45:36.150
keep them from
killing each other.

45:36.233 --> 45:38.777
It better
be somebody who knows
what they're doing.

45:38.861 --> 45:40.988
Yep, I couldn't
agree more.

45:41.071 --> 45:43.198
I mean, it's absolutely
irresponsible to leave them

45:43.282 --> 45:45.325
in the hands of
the wrong person.

45:45.409 --> 45:48.620
They're too much
of a valuable resource
to the military.

45:52.291 --> 45:54.960
So you've decided
to stay in the army?

45:55.043 --> 45:57.880
Yes, I'm gonna
stay with the men.

45:59.047 --> 46:01.341
Well, I'm glad
to hear it.

46:04.761 --> 46:07.264
Winters:
<i>So some of us would</i>
<i>stay by choice,</i>

46:07.347 --> 46:09.766
<i>but others were stuck here</i>
<i>unless we could find excuses</i>

46:09.850 --> 46:11.727
<i>to send them away.</i>

46:11.810 --> 46:13.687
So it's
an airborne exhibition.

46:13.770 --> 46:15.689
They have one of
every Allied combat plane

46:15.772 --> 46:18.025
they've used in the war.

46:15.772 --> 46:18.025
Uh-huh.

46:18.108 --> 46:20.194
I mean, yes, sir.

46:20.277 --> 46:21.987
You'll be like
a technical adviser

46:22.070 --> 46:23.822
to make sure they get
everything right.

46:23.906 --> 46:25.491
I understand, sir.

46:25.574 --> 46:27.784
I'm sorry it's not
a more hospitable location.

46:27.868 --> 46:30.496
No, sir.
Paris is just fine.

46:30.579 --> 46:32.748
You know, if you need--
if you need me to go,

46:32.831 --> 46:34.917
someone has to be there.

46:32.831 --> 46:34.917
Yeah, we do,
we absolutely do.

46:35.000 --> 46:38.545
And your driver
will drop you off
at a hotel of your choice.

46:38.629 --> 46:43.050
And I don't think
we'll see you back here
any time soon.

46:43.133 --> 46:47.221
I won't let
you down, sir.

47:00.442 --> 47:03.195
Carwood, yes.
Um...

47:03.278 --> 47:06.907
I wanted to say-- ahem,
as you probably know,

47:06.990 --> 47:09.743
the army,
when they give a man
a battlefield commission,

47:09.826 --> 47:11.537
make him an officer,

47:11.620 --> 47:14.039
they usually don't let him
stay with the same company.

47:14.122 --> 47:16.124
Yes, sir, I figured
this was coming.

47:16.208 --> 47:19.378
Yeah, they're afraid
the men won't show him
the proper degree

47:19.461 --> 47:21.421
of respect as they would
another officer.

47:21.505 --> 47:23.590
It's--
it's a good theory, sir.

47:23.674 --> 47:26.593
It's an idiotic theory,
especially in your case.

47:26.677 --> 47:29.513
Nevertheless,
they've given me the choice

47:29.596 --> 47:31.348
as to where
to re-assign you,

47:31.431 --> 47:34.476
and I thought
battalion headquarters
might be a good place.

47:34.560 --> 47:37.104
I can think of
few better, sir.

47:37.187 --> 47:39.523
Good. Good.

47:39.606 --> 47:44.069
Right now,
down at the airfield,

47:44.152 --> 47:46.572
there is a German general
who is a little PO'd

47:46.655 --> 47:49.616
about having to surrender
to Private Babe Heffron
from South Philly.

47:49.700 --> 47:51.868
Thinks it's
beneath his stature.

47:51.952 --> 47:54.037
Understandable, sir.

47:51.952 --> 47:54.037
Yeah.

47:54.121 --> 47:57.666
I thought
2nd Lieutenant Carwood Lipton
from West Virginia

47:57.749 --> 47:59.835
could soothe
his ruffled feathers.

47:59.918 --> 48:01.587
No problem, sir.

48:01.670 --> 48:06.466
Major, is this the type of job
I can expect from now on?

48:08.051 --> 48:09.928
Yeah. Yeah.

48:10.012 --> 48:12.889
When we're not sunning
ourselves by the lake.

48:23.025 --> 48:24.860
Lieutenant.

48:33.035 --> 48:37.205
With your permission,
I would like to address
my men briefly.

48:37.289 --> 48:39.416
That'll be fine,
general.

48:49.760 --> 48:52.679
Captain Sobel.

48:49.760 --> 48:52.679
Major Winters.

48:52.763 --> 48:55.057
Captain Sobel.

48:55.140 --> 48:57.392
We salute the rank,
not the man.

49:15.035 --> 49:16.703
<i>Manner,</i>

49:16.787 --> 49:19.373

49:24.044 --> 49:28.090
"Men, it's been a long war.
It's been a tough war."

49:28.173 --> 49:32.761

Towel, towel, towel,

51:01.767 --> 51:03.643
Thanks.

51:03.727 --> 51:07.314
Take a look
at these two kids.

51:07.397 --> 51:11.151
What the hell
happened to them?

51:11.234 --> 51:12.819
New Jersey, huh?

51:14.738 --> 51:18.617
Yeah.
Think about it.

51:18.700 --> 51:21.453
Yeah, I am.

51:21.536 --> 51:24.122
You awake yet?

51:25.582 --> 51:28.627
Awake?

51:28.710 --> 51:31.296
Time to
go to bed.

51:39.429 --> 51:42.557
(cheering)

51:49.439 --> 51:51.608
Come on,
we got one down.

51:51.691 --> 51:53.777
Come on, Pee Wee,
let's get Webster.

51:53.860 --> 51:55.737
Man:
Come on, Pee Wee!
Let's get him...

51:55.821 --> 51:59.407
Winters:
<i>Buck Compton came back</i>
<i>to see the company,</i>

51:59.491 --> 52:01.701
<i>to let us know</i>
<i>that he was all right.</i>

52:01.785 --> 52:04.496
<i>He became a prosecutor</i>
<i>in Los Angeles.</i>

52:04.579 --> 52:07.457
<i>He convicted Sirhan Sirhan</i>
<i>in the murder of</i>
<i>Robert Kennedy,</i>

<i>In 1961, he went out</i>
<i>on the ocean alone</i>

52:23.807 --> 52:27.060

52:29.104 --> 52:31.481
Man:
Go, go, go!

52:31.565 --> 52:34.818
<i>Johnny Martin would return</i>
<i>to his job at the railroad</i>

52:34.901 --> 52:37.529
<i>and then start</i>
<i>his own construction company.</i>

52:37.612 --> 52:41.867
<i>He splits his time</i>
<i>between Arizona and a place</i>

52:44.536 --> 52:49.207
<i>George Luz became a handyman</i>
<i>in Providence, Rhode Island.</i>

<i>As a testament</i>

52:51.751 --> 52:56.339
<i>1600 people attended</i>

53:08.476 --> 53:10.770
<i>Frank Perconte</i>

<i>Joe Liebgott</i>
<i>returned to San Francisco</i>

53:23.074 --> 53:25.243
<i>and drove his cab.</i>

53:27.037 --> 53:30.916
<i>Bull Randleman was one of</i>
<i>the best soldiers I ever had.</i>

53:30.999 --> 53:34.169
<i>He went into the earth-moving</i>
<i>business in Arkansas.</i>

53:34.252 --> 53:36.963
<i>He's still there.</i>

53:42.928 --> 53:47.140
<i>Alton More</i>
<i>returned to Wyoming</i>
<i>with a unique souvenir--</i>

53:47.223 --> 53:50.685
<i>Hitler's personal</i>
<i>photo albums.</i>

53:50.769 --> 53:54.481
<i>He was killed</i>

53:54.564 --> 53:58.777
<i>Floyd Talbert,</i>
<i>we all lost touch with</i>
<i>in civilian life,</i>

53:58.860 --> 54:04.824
<i>until he showed up</i>
<i>a reunion just before</i>

54:04.908 --> 54:08.119
<i>How we lived our lives</i>
<i>after the war</i>

54:08.203 --> 54:11.498
<i>was as varied</i>

54:11.581 --> 54:14.250
<i>Carwood Lipton became</i>
<i>a glass-making executive</i>

54:14.334 --> 54:16.962

54:38.692 --> 54:42.988
<i>He retired</i>

54:46.116 --> 54:48.576
Get 'em round.

54:48.660 --> 54:52.247
"Easy Company,"
school circle!

54:58.336 --> 55:02.841
<i>For "Easy Company",</i>
<i>it was D-Day plus 434.</i>

55:02.924 --> 55:05.635
A fast man would've
had it, Perco.

55:05.719 --> 55:08.555
Listen up,
got some news.

55:08.638 --> 55:11.808
This morning,
President Truman

55:11.891 --> 55:14.978
received the unconditional
surrender from the Japanese.

55:15.061 --> 55:17.439
War's over.

55:19.107 --> 55:22.527
<i>Regardless of points,</i>
<i>medals, or wounds,</i>

55:22.610 --> 55:26.239
<i>each man in the 101st Airborne</i>
<i>would be going home.</i>

55:26.322 --> 55:31.703
<i>Each of us</i>
<i>would be forever connected</i>
<i>by our shared experience.</i>

55:31.786 --> 55:35.874
<i>And each would have</i>
<i>to rejoin the world</i>
<i>as best he could.</i>

55:35.957 --> 55:38.752
(cheering)

55:51.765 --> 55:54.809
<i>Lewis Nixon</i>
<i>had some tough times</i>
<i>after the war.</i>

55:54.893 --> 55:56.770
<i>He was divorced</i>
<i>a couple of times,</i>

55:56.853 --> 55:59.939
<i>then in 1956, he married</i>
<i>a woman named Grace</i>

56:00.023 --> 56:02.275
<i>and everything</i>
<i>came together for him.</i>

56:02.358 --> 56:05.403
<i>He spent the rest</i>
<i>of his life with her,</i>
<i>traveling the world.</i>

56:05.487 --> 56:09.657
<i>My friend Lew</i>
<i>died in 1995.</i>

56:09.741 --> 56:12.911
<i>I took up his job offer</i>
<i>and was a personnel manager</i>

56:12.994 --> 56:15.789
<i>at the Nixon Nitration Works</i>
<i>until I was called back</i>

56:15.872 --> 56:19.084
<i>into service in 1950</i>
<i>to train officers and rangers.</i>

56:19.167 --> 56:21.461
<i>But I chose</i>
<i>not to go to Korea.</i>

56:21.544 --> 56:23.505
<i>I'd had enough of war.</i>

56:23.588 --> 56:26.007
<i>I stayed around</i>
<i>Hershey, Pennsylvania,</i>

56:26.091 --> 56:28.301
<i>finally finding</i>
<i>a little farm,</i>

56:28.384 --> 56:30.720
<i>a little peaceful</i>
<i>corner of the world,</i>

56:30.804 --> 56:32.972
<i>where I still live today.</i>

56:33.056 --> 56:35.308
<i>And there is not</i>
<i>a day that goes by</i>

56:35.391 --> 56:37.977
<i>that I do not think</i>
<i>of the men I served with</i>

56:38.061 --> 56:42.482
<i>who never got to enjoy</i>
<i>the world without war.</i>

56:42.565 --> 56:47.112
It's a very
unusual feeling.

56:47.195 --> 56:49.739
It's a very
unusual happening,

56:49.823 --> 56:51.950
and it's a very
unusual bonding.

56:52.033 --> 56:54.953
We knew that we could
depend on each other.

56:55.036 --> 56:58.123
And so, we were
a close-knit group.

56:58.206 --> 57:00.458
Just brave, so brave
it was unbelievable.

57:00.542 --> 57:05.213
And I don't know anybody
that I admire more than

57:05.296 --> 57:08.007
Bill Guarnere
and Joe Toye.

57:08.091 --> 57:12.011
And they were
very, very special.

57:12.095 --> 57:15.181
I'm just one part of
the big war, that's all.

57:15.265 --> 57:16.766
One little part.

57:16.850 --> 57:19.519
And I'm proud
to be a part of it.

57:19.602 --> 57:22.397
Sometimes it
makes me cry.

57:22.480 --> 57:25.692
The real men,
the real heroes
are the fellas

57:25.775 --> 57:27.861
that are still buried
over there

57:27.944 --> 57:30.155
and those that came home
to be buried.

57:30.238 --> 57:32.991
It seemed like you figured,
you thought that you could do

57:33.074 --> 57:36.077
just about anything.
And after the war was over

57:36.161 --> 57:37.829
and you came back out,

57:37.912 --> 57:40.498
well, you lost a lot of that,
or at least I did.

57:40.582 --> 57:42.208
I lost all
that confidence.

57:42.292 --> 57:46.421
We was hoping to stay alive,
that's all, you know.

57:48.131 --> 57:51.384
Henry the Fifth

57:51.467 --> 57:56.723
