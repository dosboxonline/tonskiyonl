WEBVTT

00:07.006 --> 00:10.468
It was a situation there
where everybody was happy

00:10.552 --> 00:12.470
to see the war
coming to an end.

00:12.554 --> 00:15.223
And the Germans didn't
really have that much
of a heart for it.

00:15.306 --> 00:17.350
And they realized
that the end was there.

00:17.434 --> 00:19.811
We used to say,
"The only good Kraut
was a dead one."

00:19.894 --> 00:22.063
Well, but there was
something in there
that, you know--

00:22.147 --> 00:26.151
"Hey, that was a kid."
Most of 'em were kids.
We all were kids.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.820
They had a job to do
the same way as me,

00:28.903 --> 00:31.030
so we went about

00:31.114 --> 00:33.908
and did the job
that we had to do.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.910
I think we thought
that the Germans were

00:35.994 --> 00:38.580
probably the evilest
people in the world.

00:38.663 --> 00:40.832
But,

00:40.915 --> 00:44.085
as the war went along,
we found out also

00:44.169 --> 00:46.880
that it wasn't
the Germans, per se.

00:46.963 --> 00:49.799
A lot of those soldiers--
I've thought about this
often--

00:49.883 --> 00:51.801
that man and I
might have been
good friends.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.845
We might have had
a lot in common.

00:53.928 --> 00:56.306
We might have
liked to fish, you know.
He might have liked to hunt.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.308
You never know,
you know.

00:58.391 --> 01:00.643
Of course, they were
doing what they were
supposed to do,

01:00.727 --> 01:03.104
and I was trying to do
what I was supposed to do.

01:03.188 --> 01:06.483
But under different
circumstances,

01:06.566 --> 01:08.693
we might have been
good friends.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.864
(theme music playing)

04:06.871 --> 04:09.749
(playing slow tune)

04:32.563 --> 04:35.358
Man:
Which way is...

04:35.441 --> 04:37.568
Woman:
It's that way.
That way.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.448
(baby crying)

05:36.252 --> 05:38.421
Tell you one thing
about the Krauts--

05:38.504 --> 05:40.548
they sure
clean up good.

05:40.631 --> 05:44.052
Yeah, all you need's
a little Mozart.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.388
Beethoven.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.556
Sorry, sir?

05:48.639 --> 05:50.683
That's not Mozart.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.728
That's Beethoven.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.818
(birds chirping)

06:00.902 --> 06:04.197
(cows mooing)

06:04.280 --> 06:06.449
(chickens squawking)

06:11.704 --> 06:13.748
Perconte:
Come on, chicken.

06:13.831 --> 06:15.917
All right, this one
got some, George.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.794
You-- you grab
the chicken

06:17.877 --> 06:19.545
and I'm gonna grab
the eggs.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.089
Great.
All right.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.800
Just grab him by the foot.
Come on, chicken.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.968
All right, if this thing
bites me, Frank,

06:26.052 --> 06:28.638
I swear I'll shoot it.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.475
<i>Guten tag, fraulein.</i>

06:32.558 --> 06:34.310
<i>Guten tag.</i>

06:34.393 --> 06:36.312
Hold on.
Hold--

06:36.395 --> 06:37.772
But, George--

06:37.855 --> 06:40.858
I'll be right back.
Hold on a second.
Hold on.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.444
Hey, hey, hey, come on.
I just want to talk to ya.

06:46.906 --> 06:48.950
I just want to talk
to you, that's all.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.369
I just want to talk.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.369
Woman:<i> Verstehe nicht.</i>

06:51.452 --> 06:53.412
Luz:
Okay, look what I got.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.623
A chocolate bar, huh?

06:55.706 --> 06:57.959
You like that?
You like chocolate, huh?

06:58.042 --> 06:59.877
Hey, Luz, why don't you
leave her alone?

06:59.961 --> 07:02.213
Frank, why don't you just
leave<i> me</i> alone, okay?

07:02.296 --> 07:04.090
You don't like chocolate?
Forget it.

07:04.173 --> 07:06.050
I don't like
chocolate either.
How about this?

07:06.134 --> 07:07.760
Cigarettes.
Camel.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.012
Yeah, you like that, huh?

07:07.844 --> 07:10.012
Luz.

07:10.096 --> 07:13.432
Frank, please,
why don't you go
make your omelet?

07:13.516 --> 07:16.185
Well, you ain't getting
none of my eggs, blockhead.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.938
Jesus, my friend
just keeps talking.

07:19.021 --> 07:23.025
Here, I got two packs.
Give it to your friends
or something.

07:24.735 --> 07:27.238
Why don't you
come sit down?
Want to sit down here?

07:27.321 --> 07:30.700
Come on.
That's it.

07:37.039 --> 07:40.209
Hey, Frank, hold on.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.794
Perc.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.921
Jesus, come on.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.134
What?

07:57.018 --> 07:58.603
That Captain Nixon?

07:58.686 --> 08:00.188
I think so.

08:00.271 --> 08:02.148
What the hell is he
doing in his harness?

08:02.231 --> 08:05.109
I don't know.
Maybe we jumped into
Berlin, the war's over.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.944
Yeah, huh?

08:07.028 --> 08:09.447
So what happened?
No dice with the fraulein?

08:09.530 --> 08:11.991
No dice.
She smacked me
in the mouth.

08:12.074 --> 08:13.868
Tell you what though--
Germany's looking like

08:13.951 --> 08:15.953
it's gonna be pretty good
fraternizing territory, huh?

08:16.037 --> 08:17.955
Yeah. Did you lose
your cigarettes?

08:18.039 --> 08:19.332
Woman:
Oh God, God.

08:19.415 --> 08:21.375
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh God.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.419
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

08:23.502 --> 08:26.214
(laughing)

08:26.297 --> 08:28.758
That's right, yeah.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.758
Speirs: Janovec?

08:28.841 --> 08:30.885
Shh, shh, shh.

08:28.841 --> 08:30.885
Janovec!

08:30.968 --> 08:33.596
Oh, shit!

08:35.097 --> 08:36.182
Sir.

08:36.265 --> 08:38.768
Where's my stuff?

08:38.851 --> 08:41.687
I thought I'd leave it
over there, sir.

08:58.996 --> 09:00.957
(men chattering
in German)

09:01.040 --> 09:03.251
(car horn honks)

09:03.334 --> 09:04.710
Over there.

09:09.548 --> 09:10.675
Here.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.176
(honks)

09:18.057 --> 09:20.685
Thanks.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.685
You're welcome, sir.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.151
Sir.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.119
Morning, sir.

09:38.202 --> 09:40.162
Morning.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.498
You got a box
all this stuff
will fit into?

09:42.581 --> 09:45.793
Yes, sir, I think so.
Same destination?

09:45.876 --> 09:47.336
Yeah.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.130
Yes, sir,
I'll make sure
it goes out

09:49.213 --> 09:50.840
first thing
in the morning.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.508
Thank you, Private.

09:52.591 --> 09:54.552
Boy, your folks
are sure gonna have
quite a collection

09:54.635 --> 09:56.596
by the time
you get...

09:58.097 --> 09:59.974
home, sir.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.437
Finders keepers.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.564
Yes, sir.

10:08.566 --> 10:11.152
(woman singing on radio)

10:29.295 --> 10:31.339
(knocks on door)

10:29.295 --> 10:31.339
Winters: Nix?

10:31.422 --> 10:33.257
Nix?

10:33.341 --> 10:35.343
In here.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.602
You dog,

10:44.685 --> 10:46.604
making combat jumps
with the 17th,

10:46.687 --> 10:49.231
while I'm
in supply briefings
all morning.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.192
Yeah, lucky me.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.277
Well, congratulations.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.363
You're probably
the only man in the 101st

10:55.446 --> 10:57.615
with three combat stars
over his jump wings.

10:57.698 --> 11:01.535
Not bad for someone
who's never fired his
weapon in combat, huh?

11:01.619 --> 11:03.537
Really?

11:03.621 --> 11:05.206
Really?
You've never--?

11:05.289 --> 11:06.665
No.

11:06.749 --> 11:10.044
Hmm, not even with all
the action we've seen?

11:10.127 --> 11:12.213
Not a round.

11:15.466 --> 11:16.675
So...

11:20.763 --> 11:23.265
how did it go this
morning-- the jump?

11:23.349 --> 11:25.518
It was great.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.436
Fantastic.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.981
We took a direct hit
over the drop zone.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.150
I got out.
Two others got out.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.487
The rest
of the boys?

11:36.570 --> 11:38.864
Well, they blew up
over Germany somewhere--

11:38.948 --> 11:40.449
boom!

11:41.575 --> 11:43.536
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm sorry.

11:43.619 --> 11:45.413
About what?

11:45.496 --> 11:47.415
Well, tough situation
for the--

11:47.498 --> 11:49.792
Oh, yeah, the boys.
Yeah, it's terrible.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.378
Oh, well.
Wasn't me.

11:55.005 --> 11:56.924
You know, the real
tragedy is

11:57.007 --> 11:59.051
they also lost their CO,

11:59.135 --> 12:02.304
so guess who gets to write
all the letters home.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.432
Goddamn nightmare.

12:13.023 --> 12:15.401
Got a visit
from Colonel Sink
this morning.

12:15.484 --> 12:17.486
Mm?

12:19.864 --> 12:21.866
And how is
the good colonel?

12:21.949 --> 12:23.951
Concerned.

12:25.244 --> 12:29.039
Still drinking nothing
but the Vat 69, huh?

12:29.123 --> 12:32.585
Only the finest
for Mrs. Nixon's
baby boy.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.339
That a problem
up at regiment?

12:37.423 --> 12:39.508
What, this?

12:39.592 --> 12:41.510
Is that what he said?

12:41.594 --> 12:44.138
No, I just don't
like it up there.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.724
Good, so you'll be
happy to hear

12:46.807 --> 12:50.227
that Sink is
transferring you back
down to Battalion S-3.

12:52.271 --> 12:55.900
What do you think
I should write to these
parents, Dick?

12:55.983 --> 12:58.736
Hear what I said, Nix?
You've been demoted.

12:58.819 --> 13:01.113
Yeah, demoted.
Got you.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.740
'Cause I don't know
how to tell them

13:02.823 --> 13:05.201
their kids never
even made it out of
the goddamn plane.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.286
You tell 'em what you
always tell 'em--

13:07.369 --> 13:09.205
their sons died
as heroes.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.291
You really still
believe that?

13:14.335 --> 13:16.045
Yeah.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.339
Yeah, I do.

13:18.422 --> 13:20.591
Don't you?

13:20.674 --> 13:23.594
(clock chiming)

13:25.554 --> 13:28.349
Nixon:
"The Cooperative for American
Remittance to Europe,

13:28.432 --> 13:29.975
"or CARE,

13:30.059 --> 13:32.102
"has begun assembling
food packages stateside

13:32.186 --> 13:35.648
to assist those
European families
in dire need,"

13:35.731 --> 13:38.192
which is presumably
all of them.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.236
So notes home
to your family,

13:40.319 --> 13:42.321
reminding them to donate
whatever they can,

13:42.404 --> 13:44.323
would be
much appreciated.

13:44.406 --> 13:46.617
I'm sure that you'll
all be happy to know

13:46.700 --> 13:48.619
"Oklahoma's" still
playing on Broadway.

13:48.702 --> 13:50.204
Yeah!

13:50.287 --> 13:51.747

13:51.830 --> 13:54.917

14:01.549 --> 14:03.968
O'Keefe, are you sitting
on your bayonet there?

14:04.051 --> 14:06.762
Why don't you leave
the singing to Luz?

14:06.845 --> 14:08.264
Unless you want
to do, like,

14:08.347 --> 14:10.307
"Surrey with the Fringe
on Top," O'Keefe.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.643
Aww, Rita Hayworth's
getting married.

14:12.726 --> 14:14.645
Oh, Rita,
say it isn't true.

14:14.728 --> 14:17.481
Abbott and Costello...
(mumbles)

14:19.233 --> 14:22.361
Wartime news.
Resistance in the Ruhr
pocket's crumbling.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.989
It looks like
there might be
a breakout in Remagen.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.575
Apparently the Krauts
forgot to blow up one
of their bridges

14:27.658 --> 14:29.618
when they headed
back over the line.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.746
I guess the boys
in the 17th Airborne
did okay after all.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.416
Eh, forget it.
We'd be in Berlin
by now, sir,

14:35.499 --> 14:37.293
if it was us
instead of them, huh?

14:37.376 --> 14:39.461
That's right, yeah.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.461
Come on.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.968
So when do you think
we're gonna jump
into Berlin,

14:46.051 --> 14:47.886
see some
real action?

14:47.970 --> 14:50.014
You in a rush?

14:47.970 --> 14:50.014
No.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.557
So what, you want
to go home

14:51.640 --> 14:53.475
with a Congressional
Medal of Honor
or something?

14:53.559 --> 14:54.768
No, I just thought
I'd ask.

14:54.852 --> 14:56.812
Why don't you
do us all a favor?

14:56.895 --> 14:58.439
Don't think.

14:58.522 --> 15:01.025
Damn replacements.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.694
Mm.

15:03.777 --> 15:06.155
(speaks Spanish)

15:08.449 --> 15:09.950
(whistles)

15:10.034 --> 15:11.535
Hallelujah.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.455
About time.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.455
Yeah, well, consider
yourselves lucky.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.540
Nixon was giving another
current-events lecture.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.168
So tell me
nothing's happening.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.837
Nothing's happening.
A couple of artillery
rounds at dawn,

15:21.920 --> 15:24.256
probably from across
the river,

15:24.340 --> 15:27.009
but that's about it.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.553
It spooked Hashey
though.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.639
Here, Perco.
I just finished it.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.641
Oh, yeah?
Any sex in it?

15:33.724 --> 15:36.935
Ain't that
kind of book.
See ya.

15:37.019 --> 15:39.772
Yeah, see ya.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.279
Man:
Okay, move on.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.865
(objects clanging)

15:56.330 --> 15:59.541
Hey, O'Brien,
relax, would you?
I'm trying to read.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.544
It's O'Keefe.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.171
Is that right?

16:02.628 --> 16:04.171
Yeah.

16:04.254 --> 16:07.424
Patrick O'Keefe.
My friends call me Paddy.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.392
(humming "She'll Be Coming
Round the Mountain")

16:18.686 --> 16:21.146
(exhales)

16:23.440 --> 16:25.275
Hey, O'Brien.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.194
Shut up!

16:27.277 --> 16:29.905
I told you,
it's O'Keefe.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.033
Do you know why no one
remembers your name?

16:33.117 --> 16:35.369
It's 'cause no one wants
to remember<i> your</i> name.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.413
There's too many
Smiths, D'Amatos

16:37.496 --> 16:39.540
and O'Keefes
and O'Briens

16:39.623 --> 16:41.875
who show up here,
replacing Toccoa men

16:41.959 --> 16:44.920
that you dumb
replacements got killed
in the first place.

16:45.003 --> 16:47.923
And they're all like you.
They're all piss
and vinegar.

16:48.006 --> 16:49.925
"Where are the Krauts at?"
"Let me at 'em."

16:50.008 --> 16:51.927
"When do I get to jump
into Berlin?"

16:52.010 --> 16:53.929
Two days later,
there they are,

16:54.012 --> 16:55.931
with their blood
and guts hanging out,

16:56.014 --> 16:57.933
and they're screaming
for a medic,

16:58.016 --> 16:59.893
begging for their
goddamn mother.

16:59.977 --> 17:03.272
Them dumb fucks
don't even know
they're dead yet.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.065
Hey, are you
listening to me?

17:05.149 --> 17:08.193
Do you understand that this is
the best part of fucking war
I've seen?

17:08.277 --> 17:11.572
I got hot chow,
hot showers, a warm bed.

17:11.655 --> 17:14.366
Germany is almost
as good as being home.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.244
I even got to wipe my ass
with real toilet paper today.

17:17.327 --> 17:20.247
So quit asking about
when you're gonna see
some action, will ya?

17:20.330 --> 17:23.292
And stop with the fucking
love songs!

17:45.439 --> 17:48.358
When did you ship out?
A few weeks ago?

17:48.442 --> 17:50.444
Yeah.

17:52.863 --> 17:55.949
It's been two years
since I seen home.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.911
Two years.

17:58.994 --> 18:01.580
This fuckin' war.

18:03.874 --> 18:06.668
Neither patrol
found a single Kraut.
There were none here either.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.670
They'll be across
the river by now.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.464
Let's send out
a night patrol,

18:10.547 --> 18:13.342
check out the embankment
on the far side.

18:13.425 --> 18:16.887
(clears throat)
The president's dead.

18:19.723 --> 18:22.518
A pair of queens bets.

18:22.601 --> 18:25.145
All right, two bucks.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.064
Nix?

18:28.065 --> 18:29.858
No, I'm out.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.568
All right.

18:31.652 --> 18:34.196
Well, I'll call
you two

18:34.279 --> 18:37.032
and I'll raise you
another two.

18:37.115 --> 18:39.910
Oh, I can't believe
we're not gonna drop
into Berlin.

18:39.993 --> 18:41.453
No shit.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.539
Ike's gonna let
the Russkies have it.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.999
Ha, Russkies.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.752
Goddamn it.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.752
Let me tell you
something, Welsh,

18:48.836 --> 18:50.838
this war is not about
fighting anymore.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.548
It's about
who gets what.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.217
Go ahead and deal me out
of the next hand.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.887
What about
your money?

18:58.971 --> 19:00.722
Are we waiting
on him again?

19:00.806 --> 19:02.224
Yep.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.742
(thunder rumbling)

19:44.349 --> 19:47.728
(dog barking)

19:50.731 --> 19:54.026
(shouts in German)

19:54.109 --> 19:56.737
Goddamn drugstore.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.286
Sir.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.083
Whoa, hey, guys,
wait up.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.461
Hey, Dexter,
how are you doing?

20:10.167 --> 20:12.461
Good to see you.

20:12.544 --> 20:15.255
You know who that was?

20:12.544 --> 20:15.255
No.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.646
Morning.

20:30.729 --> 20:33.106
Captain Nixon.
Good to see you, sir.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.108
I think I have
some mail for you.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.569
Yeah, I was gonna
drop it off this afternoon

20:37.653 --> 20:39.613
with all the other
2nd Battalion mail,

20:39.696 --> 20:42.199
but since you're here--

20:42.282 --> 20:43.784
yeah.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.285
Thanks.
Listen,

20:45.369 --> 20:47.829
I'm having some trouble
finding some whiskey.

20:47.913 --> 20:48.914
Whiskey?

20:48.997 --> 20:51.541
Yeah, a particular
brand of whiskey.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.378
Vat 69.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.378
Exactly right.

20:54.461 --> 20:56.546
I gotta be
honest with you, sir,
that ain't gonna be easy

20:56.630 --> 20:59.216
to find here in Germany.
Pickings are kind of
slim here.

20:59.299 --> 21:02.010
Yeah, don't I know it.

20:59.299 --> 21:02.010
And even if I do
find some, sir,

21:02.094 --> 21:04.012
it ain't
gonna be cheap.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.014
Well, that won't be
a problem.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.766
Hey, Vest,
you hear the news?

21:07.849 --> 21:10.018
Oh, sorry, sir.
I didn't realize
that you were here.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.186
What news?

21:11.269 --> 21:13.188
300,000 Krauts
just surrendered.

21:13.271 --> 21:14.731
(whistles)
300?

21:14.815 --> 21:17.567
Yeah, we're moving out
in an hour.

21:17.651 --> 21:18.819
One hour?

21:18.902 --> 21:20.195
Yeah.

21:21.571 --> 21:24.157
Sir, sir, your mail.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.371
Keep looking.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.085
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

21:35.168 --> 21:37.838
Get a move on.
Let's go.

21:40.716 --> 21:42.676
Jesus Christ, the dog?

21:42.759 --> 21:44.761
Lew?

21:45.846 --> 21:47.848
Cathy's divorcing me.

21:47.931 --> 21:49.975
I'm sorry.

21:50.058 --> 21:53.145
She's taking everything.

21:53.228 --> 21:55.188
She's taking the house,

21:55.272 --> 21:57.149
taking the kid.

21:57.232 --> 21:59.109
She's taking the dog.

21:59.192 --> 22:00.861
It's not even her dog!

22:00.944 --> 22:03.739
It's my dog!
She's taking my dog!

22:05.407 --> 22:08.410
Let's go!
Load 'em up, come on!

22:18.128 --> 22:21.089
Sarge, what do you
have in here?
Germans?

22:21.173 --> 22:24.259
Hey, Perconte.
You got a lighter?

22:24.342 --> 22:25.844
No, sir.
I don't smoke.

22:25.927 --> 22:27.387
Hey, where are we
headed?

22:27.471 --> 22:29.681
We're going to the Alps.
Let me see that lighter.

22:29.765 --> 22:31.600
The Alps?

22:29.765 --> 22:31.600
Yeah.

22:31.683 --> 22:33.769
That near Berlin, sir?

22:31.683 --> 22:33.769
No.

22:33.852 --> 22:35.479
That's in Bavaria,

22:35.562 --> 22:37.397
the birthplace
of National Socialism.

22:37.481 --> 22:41.234
So that mean
no drop into Berlin?

22:41.318 --> 22:43.904
No drop into Berlin.
Hitler ordered
the Waffen SS

22:43.987 --> 22:45.989
to hole up in the mountains
and repel all the invaders.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.325
He wants them to start
a guerrilla war.

22:48.408 --> 22:50.911
Invaders-- damn,
I like the sound of that.

22:50.994 --> 22:53.330
They'll die,
the last man trying.

22:53.413 --> 22:56.458
Sir.

22:53.413 --> 22:56.458
What?

22:56.541 --> 22:58.627
My lighter.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.674
All right,
nice lighter.

23:04.758 --> 23:06.301
Thanks.

23:06.384 --> 23:08.303
Waffen SS, huh?

23:08.386 --> 23:10.639
Looks like you're
gonna get your wish
anyway, O'Flannery.

23:10.722 --> 23:13.266
Those guys--
fucking crazy.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.102
It's O'Keefe.

Liebgott:
It's gonna be
good times, Web.

24:43.356 --> 24:45.358
When we get home,
I mean.

24:45.442 --> 24:48.153
First thing I'm gonna do
is get my job back

24:48.236 --> 24:50.113
at the cab company
in Frisco,

24:50.197 --> 24:52.282
make a killing off all
those fucking sailors

24:52.365 --> 24:54.534
coming home, you know?

24:54.618 --> 24:57.954
Then I'm gonna find me
a nice Jewish girl

24:58.038 --> 25:00.332
with great, big,
soft titties

25:00.415 --> 25:02.375
and a smile
to die for,

25:02.459 --> 25:04.127
marry her.

25:04.211 --> 25:06.129
Then I'm gonna
buy a house--

25:06.213 --> 25:08.256
a big house,
with lots of bedrooms

25:08.340 --> 25:11.218
for all the little Liebgotts
we're gonna be making.

25:11.301 --> 25:13.220
She oughta like that.

25:13.303 --> 25:16.181
Janovec, whatcha reading?

25:16.264 --> 25:18.225
Um, an article.

25:18.308 --> 25:20.185
No shit.

25:20.268 --> 25:22.187
What's it about?

25:22.270 --> 25:25.482
It's about why we're
fighting the war.

25:27.317 --> 25:29.819
Why are we fighting
the war, Janovec?

25:29.903 --> 25:32.489
It seems that
the Germans are bad,

25:32.572 --> 25:34.241
very bad.

25:34.324 --> 25:36.159
You don't say.

25:36.243 --> 25:37.953
The Germans
are bad, huh?

25:38.036 --> 25:40.622
Hey, Frank, this guy's
reading an article
over here,

25:40.705 --> 25:42.832
says the Germans
are bad.

25:42.916 --> 25:44.834
Liebgott:
So what about you, Web?

25:44.918 --> 25:47.128
Learn something new
every day, huh?

25:47.212 --> 25:50.048
I guess
I'll finish school
first and then--

25:50.131 --> 25:53.260
Wait a minute.
Finish school?

25:53.343 --> 25:56.471
You mean all this time
you've been talking
about Harvard this

25:56.554 --> 25:58.473
and Harvard that,
and you ain't even
finished?

25:58.556 --> 26:00.475
For one thing,
I haven't told you
anything.

26:00.558 --> 26:01.726
Oh.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.436
But yes, yes,
I haven't finished.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.355
So the fuck what?

26:05.438 --> 26:07.816
All right, Web,
breathe a little.
Jesus.

26:07.899 --> 26:10.193
Fuck.

26:10.277 --> 26:12.779
It's just the way
you always talked,
you know?

26:12.862 --> 26:15.365
We all figured
that--

26:19.327 --> 26:22.539
Hey, you know what?
You're right.
So the fuck what?

26:26.293 --> 26:28.503
So what did you study?

26:26.293 --> 26:28.503
Hey, man, I'm--

26:31.589 --> 26:33.425
Literature.

26:33.508 --> 26:36.011
Get outta here.
You serious?

26:36.094 --> 26:38.013
I love to read.

26:38.096 --> 26:39.973
Do you?

26:38.096 --> 26:39.973
Yeah.

26:40.056 --> 26:42.809
Dick Tracy,
Flash Gordon mostly.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.730
Yeah, fuck.

26:52.861 --> 26:55.238
Up, three.

26:57.532 --> 27:00.618
(woman speaking German)

27:00.702 --> 27:03.163
Tell her she's got
five minutes.

27:03.246 --> 27:05.957
(woman continues speaking)

27:03.246 --> 27:05.957
<i>Geh raus, geh raus.</i>

27:06.041 --> 27:08.835
Man:
Let's go, let's go.
Move, move!

27:10.295 --> 27:12.672
<i>Raus!</i>
<i>Raus!</i>

27:12.756 --> 27:14.549
(speaking German)

27:14.632 --> 27:17.218
Sir, she says
they've got nowhere to go,
but the house next door's--

27:17.302 --> 27:19.929
Hey, do you hear this?
This guy says he ain't
a Nazi.

27:20.013 --> 27:22.432
Now why is it
in all of Germany
I've never met one Nazi yet?

27:22.515 --> 27:25.518
We're only gonna
be here one night!
You've got four minutes!

27:27.562 --> 27:30.357
Man:<i> Mathilde, komm.</i>

27:27.562 --> 27:30.357
Woman:<i> Komm, Wilhelm.</i>

27:30.440 --> 27:32.233
<i>Wir sind keine Nazis.</i>

27:30.440 --> 27:32.233
Come on.

27:32.317 --> 27:34.361
<i>Wir sind keine Nazis.</i>

27:32.317 --> 27:34.361
Let's go, go, move!

27:34.444 --> 27:36.613
All of you, out!

27:38.406 --> 27:41.701
(rhythmic marching)

27:44.245 --> 27:47.082
(boys speaking German)

28:10.688 --> 28:12.232
Look at 'em.

28:12.315 --> 28:15.527
Even in defeat,
they still know
how to march with pride.

28:26.246 --> 28:29.541
(speaks German)

28:29.624 --> 28:32.210
Web:
Hey, you!

28:32.293 --> 28:34.045
Hey, you!

28:34.129 --> 28:37.507
That's right,
you stupid Kraut
bastards!

28:37.590 --> 28:39.217
That's right!

28:39.300 --> 28:41.261
Say hello to Ford

28:41.344 --> 28:43.471
and General
fucking Motors!

28:43.555 --> 28:46.266
You stupid
fascist pigs!

28:46.349 --> 28:48.768
Look at you!
You have horses!

28:48.852 --> 28:50.562
What were you
thinking?

28:50.645 --> 28:53.231
That's enough,
Webster.

28:53.314 --> 28:56.109
Give it a rest.

28:56.192 --> 28:58.069
Dragging our asses

28:58.153 --> 29:00.029
halfway around
the world,

29:00.113 --> 29:02.657
interrupting our lives.
For what?

29:02.740 --> 29:05.368
You ignorant,
servile scum!

29:05.452 --> 29:08.204
What the fuck
are we doing here?

29:08.288 --> 29:10.290
Huh?

29:26.139 --> 29:29.017
(men shouting in French)

29:29.100 --> 29:31.644
(gunshots)

30:22.111 --> 30:24.614
Man:
Everyone out!
Move it, move it.

30:24.697 --> 30:27.825
1st Platoon...
(continues shouting)

30:31.996 --> 30:33.873
I want to send out
some patrols.

30:33.957 --> 30:36.501
We'll have Dog
here in the village,
Easy and Fox in the woods.

30:36.584 --> 30:39.254
Okay.
Easy Company's gonna
take the northwest.

30:39.337 --> 30:41.422
Lieutenant Lipton,
have 1st and 2nd Platoons

30:41.506 --> 30:43.466
swing up to the woods.
Have 3rd swing around.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.260
Yes, sir.
1st Sergeant Talbert!

30:45.343 --> 30:47.595
You're not worried
about an ambush,
are you?

30:47.679 --> 30:49.597
No.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.517
Just in case we have to
stay here for the night.

31:11.119 --> 31:13.121
O'Keefe.

31:11.119 --> 31:13.121
Sarge.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.206
Why the hell are you
so jumpy, boy?

31:15.290 --> 31:16.916
I'm not jumpy.
I'm fine.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.795
Shit, can hear
your heart pounding
in Arkansas, boy.

31:20.878 --> 31:23.590
Jesus Christ, give
the kid a break, Bull.

31:26.259 --> 31:28.595
Hey, George.

31:26.259 --> 31:28.595
Yeah?

31:28.678 --> 31:30.972
Kinda remind you
of Bastogne?

31:32.390 --> 31:35.268
Yeah, now that
you mention it.

31:35.351 --> 31:38.479
Except, of course,
there's no snow,

31:38.563 --> 31:40.523
we got warm grub
in our bellies

31:40.607 --> 31:44.193
and the trees
aren't fucking exploding
from Kraut artillery.

31:44.277 --> 31:46.613
But, yeah, Frank,
other than that,

31:46.696 --> 31:48.323
it's a lot
like Bastogne.

31:48.406 --> 31:49.824
Right?

31:49.907 --> 31:52.285
Bull, smack him
for me, please.

31:52.368 --> 31:54.037
Thank you.

32:05.256 --> 32:07.300
Nixon:
Hello?

32:14.223 --> 32:16.225
Hello?

32:49.384 --> 32:51.761
(glass breaks)

33:22.041 --> 33:24.377
(dog barking)

33:48.317 --> 33:50.778
It sure is quiet.

33:53.364 --> 33:55.616
He is right, fellas.

35:10.483 --> 35:12.318
Perconte: You seen Foley?

35:10.483 --> 35:12.318
Man: No.

35:12.401 --> 35:14.487
Hey, guys.
Any of you guys see
any of the officers?

35:14.570 --> 35:16.280
Foley, Nixon?

35:14.570 --> 35:16.280
No, speak to Popeye.

35:16.364 --> 35:18.908
Hey, Pop.

35:16.364 --> 35:18.908
Popeye, seen any officers--
Nixon, Foley?

35:18.991 --> 35:21.744
Speirs is searching
them buildings right
down the street.

35:21.828 --> 35:23.329
What's the matter?

35:23.412 --> 35:25.873
More, More,
have you seen
any of the officers?

35:25.957 --> 35:27.959
Yeah, Major Winters
is right in there.

35:28.042 --> 35:30.294
You all right,
Frank?

35:33.923 --> 35:36.092
Major Winters, sir.

35:36.175 --> 35:38.052
Uh, we found something.

35:38.135 --> 35:41.305
We're out on patrol
and we came across this--

35:41.389 --> 35:44.016
What, what, what, what?
Frank, Frank, what is it?

35:45.476 --> 35:48.020
I don't know, sir.

35:48.104 --> 35:50.106
I don't know.

37:10.770 --> 37:12.980
Major, sir.

37:18.527 --> 37:20.112
Open it up.

37:20.196 --> 37:21.822
Sir.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.954
Stand back.

37:28.037 --> 37:31.248
Give us some room here.
Stand back.

37:31.332 --> 37:34.001
Back, back.

37:59.610 --> 38:03.155
(men speaking German)

38:10.288 --> 38:12.707
Christenson, any of your
men speak German?

38:12.790 --> 38:14.000
No, sir.

38:15.668 --> 38:17.712
I need Liebgott.
Liebgott!

38:17.795 --> 38:20.131
Lipton, find me Liebgott.

38:17.795 --> 38:20.131
Yes, sir.

38:20.214 --> 38:22.883
Liebgott, Liebgott!

38:22.967 --> 38:26.846
Liebgott, Major needs you
up front, right now.

38:26.929 --> 38:29.056
Sure.

38:29.140 --> 38:32.018
All right, boys,
these people need care.
Give them water

38:32.101 --> 38:35.104
and any spare
rations you might have.
Grab me some blankets, quick.

38:35.187 --> 38:37.815
Oh, my god.

38:39.650 --> 38:41.652
Dick.

39:22.151 --> 39:25.029
(speaking Polish)

39:31.327 --> 39:32.912
I'm sorry.

39:32.995 --> 39:35.122
Here, take some water.

39:37.333 --> 39:40.544
Jesus, Web,
can you believe this place?

39:40.628 --> 39:43.172
No.

39:40.628 --> 39:43.172
My god.

39:48.886 --> 39:51.472
(sobbing)

39:58.771 --> 40:00.606
It's okay.

40:00.689 --> 40:03.275
Better now, eh?
Yeah?

40:03.359 --> 40:05.361
It's okay.

40:07.321 --> 40:10.324
(speaking German)

40:10.407 --> 40:13.077
He said the guards left
this morning, sir.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.454
(speaking German)

40:19.750 --> 40:22.253
They burned
some of the huts first.

40:24.088 --> 40:27.508
With the prisoners still
in them, sir, alive.

40:27.591 --> 40:29.510
Nixon:
Jesus Christ.

40:29.593 --> 40:32.179
(speaking German)

40:32.263 --> 40:34.765
Some of the prisoners
who tried to stop them--

40:36.934 --> 40:39.311
Some of them
were killed.

40:43.440 --> 40:46.777
They didn't have
enough ammo for all
the prisoners, so...

40:48.946 --> 40:51.073
they killed as many
as they could...

40:53.909 --> 40:55.995
...before they left
the camp.

40:58.414 --> 41:00.374
They locked the gate
behind them

41:00.457 --> 41:03.210
and headed south.

41:03.294 --> 41:06.589
Someone in town
must have told them
we were coming.

41:06.672 --> 41:08.841
Yeah, I think so.

41:12.344 --> 41:14.972
Will you ask him--

41:15.055 --> 41:17.224
ask him what kind
of camp this is?

41:17.308 --> 41:21.270
Um, what, uh--

41:21.353 --> 41:23.272
why are they here?

41:23.355 --> 41:25.733
<i>Was ist das hier?</i>

41:25.816 --> 41:27.902
(speaking German)

41:32.656 --> 41:35.201
He says
it's a work camp for...

41:35.284 --> 41:37.453
<i>Unerwunscht?</i>

41:37.536 --> 41:40.372
I'm not sure
what the word means, sir.

41:40.456 --> 41:42.625
Uh, "unwanted"?

41:42.708 --> 41:44.710
"Disliked" maybe?

41:44.793 --> 41:46.253
"Criminals"?

41:46.337 --> 41:48.339
I don't think
"criminals," sir.

41:48.422 --> 41:50.424
<i>Verbrecher?</i>

41:52.843 --> 41:53.969
No.

41:54.053 --> 41:55.679
(speaking German)

41:55.763 --> 41:59.099
Doctors, musicians,
tailors, clerks,

41:59.183 --> 42:01.602
farmers, intellectuals--
I mean, normal people.

42:01.685 --> 42:04.271
<i>Juden.</i>
<i>Juden.</i>

42:04.355 --> 42:06.482
<i>Juden.</i>

42:08.651 --> 42:10.569
They're Jews.

42:10.653 --> 42:13.614
<i>Polieren, Zigeuner.</i>

42:13.697 --> 42:15.574
Poles and gypsies.

42:15.658 --> 42:17.952
(continues speaking
German)

42:21.413 --> 42:24.750
(speaks German)

42:30.047 --> 42:31.966
(sobbing)

42:32.049 --> 42:34.093
Liebgott?

42:34.176 --> 42:37.388
The women's camp
is at the next
railroad stop.

42:37.471 --> 42:39.723
(sobbing)

43:06.709 --> 43:08.877
Hey, Babe, come here.

43:12.172 --> 43:14.216
Look at their arms.

43:17.261 --> 43:19.138
Like cattle.

43:19.221 --> 43:21.890
(quietly)
Goddamn.

43:21.974 --> 43:23.809
Jesus.

44:42.179 --> 44:44.181
O'Keefe.

44:45.849 --> 44:47.726
O'Keefe?

45:12.668 --> 45:15.421
I'm gonna call Sink.

45:15.504 --> 45:17.381
Find Speirs
and figure out

45:17.464 --> 45:19.800
how the hell
to get them some food

45:19.883 --> 45:21.552
and water.

45:32.104 --> 45:35.441
Let's go.
Let's pick up
the pace, come on.

45:37.484 --> 45:40.446
Sergeant Martin,
get whatever we can fit
on the deuce and a half.

45:40.529 --> 45:42.156
Move.
Let's move.

45:42.239 --> 45:45.075
(shouting in German)

45:47.411 --> 45:50.456
Shut up.
Take everything.
Take it all.

45:50.539 --> 45:53.500
Check the back and--
shut up!

45:53.584 --> 45:56.295
Check the back and see
if there's any kind of--

45:56.378 --> 45:57.921
shut up!

46:02.009 --> 46:04.470
I said shut up,
you Nazi fuck!

46:04.553 --> 46:06.972
<i>Ich-- ich--</i>
<i>ich bin kein Nazi.</i>
<i>Ich bin kein Nazi.</i>

46:07.055 --> 46:10.100
You're not a Nazi.
My mistake, you fat
fucking prick.

46:10.184 --> 46:12.102
How about a human being?
Are you one of those?

46:12.186 --> 46:14.188
Or are you gonna tell me
that you never smelled

46:14.271 --> 46:15.981
the fucking stench?

46:16.064 --> 46:18.692
(speaking German)

46:18.775 --> 46:20.527
Let him go, Web.

46:20.611 --> 46:23.405
He says he doesn't know
what the hell you're
talking about.

46:28.660 --> 46:30.662
Bullshit.

46:45.511 --> 46:47.554
Sergeant Talbert,
this is chaos.

46:47.638 --> 46:50.224
There's plenty
to go round, please.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.482
We've got more water
on the way.

46:58.565 --> 47:00.526
Dick.
Major Winters.

47:00.609 --> 47:02.611
Yes, sir.

47:03.820 --> 47:05.447
Sir.

47:06.823 --> 47:08.826
This is Dr. Kent,
the regimental surgeon.

47:08.909 --> 47:10.494
Now, Doc, you tell
Major Winters

47:10.577 --> 47:12.204
and Captain Nixon
what you just told me.

47:12.287 --> 47:13.872
Yes, sir.
We need to stop

47:13.956 --> 47:15.666
giving these men
food right now.

47:15.749 --> 47:17.668
They're starving.
If we give them
too much to eat

47:17.751 --> 47:19.628
too quickly,
they'll eat themselves
to death.

47:19.711 --> 47:21.380
We need to keep them
in the camp

47:21.463 --> 47:23.382
till we can find
a place for 'em in town.

47:23.465 --> 47:25.759
You want us to lock
these people back up?

47:25.842 --> 47:28.262
We got no choice, Nix.

47:25.842 --> 47:28.262
Otherwise they
might scatter.

47:28.345 --> 47:30.722
We need to keep
them centralized,
so we can supervise

47:30.806 --> 47:32.766
their food intake
and medical treatment.

47:32.849 --> 47:34.810
So until we find
someplace better--

47:34.893 --> 47:37.312
Colonel Sink.

47:37.396 --> 47:39.314
It's a crying-ass shame,
but let's get it done.

47:39.398 --> 47:41.441
Yes, sir.

47:39.398 --> 47:41.441
I don't like it
any more than you guys.

47:43.735 --> 47:46.113
General Taylor?

47:46.196 --> 47:48.323
Bob Sink, 506.
Sir, we're on--

47:48.407 --> 47:51.618
we're at Landsberg,
the other side
of Buchloe.

47:51.702 --> 47:54.997
We found something
I believe you ought
to see, sir.

47:55.080 --> 47:58.834
I can't tell them
that, sir.

47:58.917 --> 48:01.003
You've got to, Joe.

48:05.048 --> 48:07.092
Yes, sir.

48:12.014 --> 48:14.266
Grant, Christenson,

48:14.349 --> 48:17.477
these prisoners
have to be put back
in the camp immediately.

48:17.561 --> 48:19.605
Let the men know.

48:20.522 --> 48:22.774
<i>Achtung, bitte!</i>

48:22.858 --> 48:25.319
<i>Achtung,</i>
<i>bitte!</i>

48:27.654 --> 48:30.032
(shouting in German)

49:14.326 --> 49:17.454
(tower bell ringing)

49:24.252 --> 49:26.338
(knocks on door)

49:26.421 --> 49:28.382
Turns out
I'm staying

49:28.465 --> 49:31.593
in the only dry
friggin' house
in Germany.

49:31.677 --> 49:33.887
Thought you weren't
drinking the local.

49:33.971 --> 49:35.847
Yeah, well...

49:37.516 --> 49:39.643
Heard from Division.

49:39.726 --> 49:43.814
Been finding
camps like this
all over the place.

49:43.897 --> 49:45.732
Jesus.

49:45.816 --> 49:47.693
Seems the Russians

49:47.776 --> 49:50.487
liberated one
a lot worse.

49:50.570 --> 49:51.822
Worse?

49:51.905 --> 49:53.156
Yeah.

49:53.240 --> 49:55.534
Apparently.

49:55.617 --> 49:57.494
10 times as big,

49:57.577 --> 50:00.455
execution chambers,
ovens.

50:00.539 --> 50:04.126
For cremating
all the bodies.

50:05.794 --> 50:08.380
Jesus.

50:08.463 --> 50:11.633
The locals claim
that they never even knew
the camp existed.

50:11.717 --> 50:14.219
They say
we're exaggerating.

50:14.302 --> 50:16.430
Well, they're gonna have

50:16.513 --> 50:18.807
a hell of an education
tomorrow.

50:18.890 --> 50:22.102
General Taylor
declared martial law
about an hour ago,

50:22.185 --> 50:24.980
ordered every able-bodied
German in town,
aged 14 to 80,

50:25.063 --> 50:26.606
to start burying
the bodies.

50:26.690 --> 50:28.567
That'll begin
in the morning.

50:28.650 --> 50:31.027
10th Armored are gonna
supervise cleanup.

50:31.111 --> 50:32.404
What about us?

50:32.487 --> 50:34.698
We head out for...

50:34.781 --> 50:38.034
Thalem-- Thalem--
tomorrow,

50:38.118 --> 50:40.120
1200 hours.

51:04.728 --> 51:06.313
Kerchief, sir?

51:06.396 --> 51:07.898
What?

51:07.981 --> 51:09.983
No, thanks.

51:12.819 --> 51:15.113
Move along.
Over there.

52:06.206 --> 52:08.750
(crying)

53:00.218 --> 53:03.889
(musicians continue
playing)

53:13.064 --> 53:15.483
Hitler's dead.

53:16.985 --> 53:18.278
Holy shit.

53:18.361 --> 53:21.573
Shot himself
in Berlin.

53:21.656 --> 53:23.909
Is the war over, sir?

53:23.992 --> 53:25.994
No.

53:27.829 --> 53:29.581
We have orders
to Berchtesgaden.

53:29.664 --> 53:31.583
We're gonna move out
in one hour.

53:31.666 --> 53:34.419
Why?
The man's not home.

53:35.837 --> 53:38.131
Should have
killed himself
three years ago,

53:38.214 --> 53:40.300
saved us a lot
of trouble.

53:41.217 --> 53:43.803
Yeah, he should have.

53:45.555 --> 53:47.807
But he didn't.

54:53.748 --> 54:56.668
(music playing)
