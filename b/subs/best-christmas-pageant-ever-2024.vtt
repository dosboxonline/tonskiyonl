01:15.868 --> 01:17.577
<i>"The Herdmans were absolutely</i>

01:17.578 --> 01:20.706
<i>"the worst kids
in the history of the world."</i>

01:24.334 --> 01:25.419
<i>They lied.</i>

01:30.465 --> 01:31.633
<i>They stole.</i>

01:34.803 --> 01:35.804
Come back here!

01:41.393 --> 01:43.604
<i>They smoked cigars.</i>

01:47.774 --> 01:49.484
<i>Even the girls.</i>

01:50.611 --> 01:51.694
<i>They hit little kids.</i>

01:51.695 --> 01:53.864
<i>Even if the little kids
were bigger than them.</i>

01:55.199 --> 01:56.408
Hey!

02:02.539 --> 02:04.540
<i>They took
the Lord's name in vain.</i>

02:04.541 --> 02:06.835
Oh, my God!

02:11.465 --> 02:13.008
<i>They cussed teachers.</i>

02:18.805 --> 02:20.264
<i>They even set fire</i>

02:20.265 --> 02:22.768
<i>to Fred Shoemaker's old,
broken-down tool shed.</i>

02:23.685 --> 02:25.478
<i>To be fair, the shed was ugly</i>

02:25.479 --> 02:27.523
<i>and was about
to fall over anyway.</i>

02:28.148 --> 02:30.191
<i>My father said, "Burning it down</i>

02:30.192 --> 02:32.735
<i>"was the only good thing
the Herdmans ever did,</i>

02:32.736 --> 02:34.529
<i>"and if they'd known
it was a good thing,</i>

02:34.530 --> 02:36.323
<i>"they wouldn't have
done it at all."</i>

02:37.366 --> 02:39.951
<i>They were just
so all-around awful,</i>

02:39.952 --> 02:42.370
<i>you could hardly believe
they were real.</i>

02:42.371 --> 02:44.455
<i>No one knew
why they were that way.</i>

02:44.456 --> 02:46.792
<i>It seemed they just came out
of the womb mean.</i>

02:47.543 --> 02:49.085
<i>And speaking of that womb,</i>

02:49.086 --> 02:51.754
<i>us kids have never
seen their parents.</i>

02:51.755 --> 02:54.090
<i>Some thought they'd given up
and run away.</i>

02:54.091 --> 02:57.552
<i>My theory was that they were the
first parents to be kidnapped</i>

02:57.553 --> 03:00.180
<i>tied up,
and robbed by their own kids.</i>

03:00.931 --> 03:02.056
<i>Ralph,</i>

03:02.057 --> 03:03.975
<i>Leroy,</i>

03:03.976 --> 03:05.518
<i>Claude,</i>

03:05.519 --> 03:07.061
<i>Ollie,</i>

03:07.062 --> 03:08.729
<i>Gladys,</i>

03:08.730 --> 03:11.650
<i>and the toughest one
of them all, Imogene.</i>

03:12.651 --> 03:14.527
<i>All the same,
except for different sizes</i>

03:14.528 --> 03:16.112
<i>and different
black-and-blue marks</i>

03:16.113 --> 03:18.155
<i>where they had
clonked each other.</i>

03:18.156 --> 03:20.283
Okay, everybody,
find your seats.

03:20.284 --> 03:22.618
I hope you're ready
for Show and Tell.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.371
My first Shower-and-Teller
will be...

03:25.372 --> 03:26.456
Me.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.501
Okay. Ollie Herdman is first.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.211
I'm... Wait.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.588
It's my cat.

03:33.589 --> 03:34.673
Spike.

03:52.149 --> 03:53.692
What's all the fuss about?

03:58.530 --> 03:59.530
I can't see. I can't see.

03:59.531 --> 04:00.616
<i>That's me.</i>

04:02.034 --> 04:03.034
Hey!

04:03.035 --> 04:04.745
<i>Did I mention they stole?</i>

04:10.000 --> 04:11.334
What do you want?

04:11.335 --> 04:12.586
This necklace?

04:13.504 --> 04:15.880
Or your neck? Hmm?

04:15.881 --> 04:17.256
<i>I chose my neck.</i>

04:17.257 --> 04:18.590
<i>I usually avoided trouble,</i>

04:18.591 --> 04:21.428
<i>but apparently my favourite
locket got her attention.</i>

04:22.930 --> 04:25.515
<i>Imogene was their
unchallenged leader.</i>

04:25.516 --> 04:28.518
<i>She struck mortal fear
into anyone in her path,</i>

04:28.519 --> 04:30.645
<i>including adults.</i>

04:30.646 --> 04:32.813
<i>She especially
didn't like Alice.</i>

04:32.814 --> 04:34.565
- Hey, Nits.
- Ow!

04:34.566 --> 04:35.983
<i>Probably because Alice</i>

04:35.984 --> 04:38.153
<i>was the exact opposite
of Imogene.</i>

04:39.780 --> 04:41.072
<i>All the way down to her...</i>

04:41.073 --> 04:43.366
Your hands
smell like soap again.

04:43.367 --> 04:44.659
Hiding your nits?

04:44.660 --> 04:47.412
It was head lice, and it was
one time at summer camp.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.415
<i>But Imogene never forgets.</i>

04:55.838 --> 04:57.798
- The Herdmans are just...
- I know.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.759
The Herdmans are absolutely

05:01.760 --> 05:03.929
the worst kids
in the history of the world.

05:07.099 --> 05:09.059
What'd they do now, dear?

05:10.394 --> 05:12.311
<i>My mum gave me that locket.</i>

05:12.312 --> 05:13.397
Nothing.

05:14.481 --> 05:15.482
The usual.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.316
Set something on fire?

05:17.317 --> 05:19.986
Dump soapy water
down a school hallway?

05:19.987 --> 05:23.573
Steal your lunch and then punch
you for not havin' any sweets?

05:23.574 --> 05:25.616
Something like that.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.743
Do your homework tonight.
Big day tomorrow.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.954
- Gettin' the Christmas tree.
- Great, Dad.

05:29.955 --> 05:33.041
I'm sure the Herdmans
will find some way to ruin it.

05:35.127 --> 05:36.211
That's not very jolly.

05:38.088 --> 05:41.550
God, this is a selfish prayer.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.636
I know
I shouldn't pray it, but...

05:46.013 --> 05:47.054
can you send the Herdmans

05:47.055 --> 05:48.724
somewhere far away
until I grow up?

05:51.226 --> 05:53.061
Somewhere without many people.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.857
Maybe an island
with no people at all.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.110
And violent,
dangerous creatures.

06:01.111 --> 06:04.615
Either do that, or make me
invisible until college.

06:05.782 --> 06:06.950
That would fix it.

06:08.535 --> 06:09.661
Thanks, God.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.248
Sorry for this awful prayer.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.375
<i>We figured the Herdmans
were headed straight for Hell</i>

06:16.376 --> 06:18.377
<i>by way of the state prison</i>

06:18.378 --> 06:20.713
<i>until they got mixed up
with my mother,</i>

06:20.714 --> 06:22.841
<i>our church,
and our big Christmas pageant.</i>

06:31.892 --> 06:33.059
<i>That's my family.</i>

06:33.060 --> 06:35.561
<i>My dad, Bob,
full-time accountant,</i>

06:35.562 --> 06:37.647
<i>my mum, Grace, full-time mum,</i>

06:37.648 --> 06:40.234
<i>my brother, Charlie,
full-time smart alec.</i>

06:43.070 --> 06:44.154
Every year.

06:45.364 --> 06:46.782
Okay. Honey.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.954
Little help, please. Sweetheart?

06:54.248 --> 06:57.000
<i>Normal family in a normal town.</i>

06:59.211 --> 07:00.462
<i>And this is our town.</i>

07:01.338 --> 07:02.631
<i>It doesn't have much.</i>

07:03.298 --> 07:05.383
<i>The one thing our town
was known for</i>

07:05.384 --> 07:07.593
<i>was our church's annual
Christmas pageant.</i>

07:07.594 --> 07:09.680
<i>It was a big deal.</i>

07:09.930 --> 07:12.015
<i>Even bigger this year
because of the anniversary.</i>

07:13.350 --> 07:15.726
<i>I'll tell you everything
you need to know</i>

07:15.727 --> 07:17.521
<i>about the Emmanuel Annual.</i>

07:19.648 --> 07:20.940
<i>This is the very first one,</i>

07:20.941 --> 07:23.067
<i>the year our church
in our town opened.</i>

07:23.068 --> 07:25.778
<i>Legend has it, the pageant
used to mean something</i>

07:25.779 --> 07:27.947
<i>and that everyone in town
was excited to see it.</i>

07:27.948 --> 07:29.448
<i>They wanted to be reminded</i>

07:29.449 --> 07:31.158
<i>of the beauty
of the Christmas story</i>

07:31.159 --> 07:34.246
<i>But I'm not sure the pageant
was all that beautiful any more.</i>

07:34.997 --> 07:36.664
<i>This is us last year.</i>

07:36.665 --> 07:38.708
<i>That's Alice,
you met her earlier,</i>

07:38.709 --> 07:40.835
<i>in her third year playing Mary.</i>

07:40.836 --> 07:42.545
<i>And that's Mrs Armstrong,</i>

07:42.546 --> 07:44.839
<i>who's directed the pageant
for forever</i>

07:44.840 --> 07:48.718
<i>and makes sure
nothing ever changes, ever.</i>

07:48.719 --> 07:51.554
<i>In my opinion,
after the 74th same old pageant,</i>

07:51.555 --> 07:54.640
<i>it had all the depth and joy
of a recycled Christmas card.</i>

07:54.641 --> 07:56.184
<i>But keeping it the same</i>

07:56.185 --> 07:58.395
<i>is exactly how the town
wanted it.</i>

08:00.189 --> 08:01.731
<i>Because it was the 75th,</i>

08:01.732 --> 08:03.399
<i>there was even more attention
than normal.</i>

08:03.400 --> 08:05.359
<i>People from other towns
were coming.</i>

08:05.360 --> 08:06.652
<i>Former cast members.</i>

08:06.653 --> 08:08.237
<i>It was even in the paper.</i>

08:08.238 --> 08:10.281
<i>And the Ladies Aid
was helping with the costumes</i>

08:10.282 --> 08:11.825
<i>to make them nicer than normal.</i>

08:21.251 --> 08:23.587
- Is that level?
- Tilting to the left.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.130
- How about... How about now?
- Oh, that's worse.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.381
<i>- Finally...</i>
- What?

08:27.382 --> 08:29.509
<i>...in local news,
'tis the season to remind you</i>

08:29.510 --> 08:32.595
<i>of the annual Christmas pageant
in the town of Emmanuel,</i>

08:32.596 --> 08:35.181
<i>which will actually fall on
Christmas Day this year.</i>

08:35.182 --> 08:37.099
They're advertising on TV now?

08:37.100 --> 08:39.351
Attendance and giving
are down at church.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.894
The town needs visitors.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.523
I think they're desperate.

08:43.524 --> 08:44.899
Okay, just tell me
when it's right.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.108
You don't have to tell me
it's wrong.

08:46.109 --> 08:47.401
I'll just assume
that it's wrong,

08:47.402 --> 08:49.237
and you tell me
if it stops being wrong.

08:49.238 --> 08:50.322
That's level.

08:51.365 --> 08:52.698
These are kind of hot.

08:52.699 --> 08:53.784
- Hold on.
- What?

08:57.412 --> 08:58.663
- There.
- They got...

08:58.664 --> 09:01.624
<i>So, it's time to tell you
something about my mum.</i>

09:01.625 --> 09:04.545
<i>It's hard to sum up what
she does in a single sentence.</i>

09:05.295 --> 09:08.089
<i>Whether it was doing our annual
Christmas decorating together</i>

09:08.090 --> 09:10.341
<i>or making sure we participated
in the Christmas pageant,</i>

09:10.342 --> 09:12.093
<i>even if we didn't want to,</i>

09:12.094 --> 09:14.262
<i>she kept our family on track.</i>

09:14.263 --> 09:16.931
<i>That was her main focus in life,</i>

09:16.932 --> 09:20.686
<i>but that was about to change
right now.</i>

09:23.480 --> 09:25.064
- Careful.
- What's going on?

09:25.065 --> 09:28.318
- Is that a Herdman fire?
- That's the Armstrong house.

09:33.824 --> 09:35.157
<i>Oh, no.</i>

09:35.158 --> 09:37.827
<i>Mrs Wendelken. Alice's mum,</i>

09:37.828 --> 09:40.162
<i>the queen bee
of the town supermums,</i>

09:40.163 --> 09:41.998
<i>whose single glance...</i>

09:41.999 --> 09:43.291
<i>That's the one.</i>

09:43.292 --> 09:44.709
<i>...could make my mum feel small.</i>

09:44.710 --> 09:47.212
- Tuck in your shirt. Oh.
- It's under my coat.

09:48.964 --> 09:49.965
You're gonna be okay.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.885
Helen, are you in much pain?

09:53.886 --> 09:56.721
- Yes. Terrible.
- I'm so sorry. What happened?

09:56.722 --> 09:58.556
I took a spill. Never mind how.

09:58.557 --> 09:59.808
Broke both of her legs.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.685
- Both of them?
- Yes, both.

10:02.686 --> 10:04.729
Call Mr Armstrong
at the factory.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.480
And shut off the cooker
under my potatoes

10:06.481 --> 10:08.108
or the whole house'll burn down.

10:08.817 --> 10:11.153
Inform the Ladies Aid,
I will not be at the meeting.

10:11.862 --> 10:13.821
We need to find a replacement
for the bazaar.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.907
- Okay, that's a lot.
- And the Potluck Committee.

10:15.908 --> 10:17.241
And the Beautification
Committee.

10:17.242 --> 10:19.703
- Of course.
- And the Christmas pageant.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.998
I'll need someone
who can follow my plan.

10:23.999 --> 10:25.500
- Rebecca?
- Yes.

10:25.501 --> 10:27.960
You could do that.
Especially because of Alice.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.962
I can't, obviously.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.131
I'm too busy with my job
and the other committees.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.718
But don't worry, Helen.
We'll find someone.

10:35.427 --> 10:36.637
I suppose I could try.

10:38.222 --> 10:39.555
That's okay, Grace.

10:39.556 --> 10:43.267
The pageant is an especially
big deal this year.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.478
You can bring the biscuits.
That's your thing.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.022
I'm sorry, "my thing"?

10:48.357 --> 10:50.441
Bringing the biscuits
is "my thing"?

10:50.442 --> 10:54.071
Well, your shop-bought brand
from last year were so tasty.

10:55.739 --> 10:56.949
You'll be great.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.117
We'll find someone, Helen.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.415
<i>One other thing about my mum,</i>

11:06.416 --> 11:07.792
<i>she preferred
keeping life simple.</i>

11:07.793 --> 11:11.212
<i>But if one of the judgy
town mums challenged her,</i>

11:11.213 --> 11:13.005
<i>she'd try anything.</i>

11:13.006 --> 11:14.090
<i>Even...</i>

11:14.091 --> 11:15.968
- Mrs Armstrong?
- You did what?

11:18.679 --> 11:21.055
You volunteered to direct
the Christmas pageant?

11:21.056 --> 11:22.223
She needed help.

11:22.224 --> 11:24.141
Mrs Wendelken was gonna find...

11:24.142 --> 11:25.685
Mrs Wendelken doesn't have
to do everything

11:25.686 --> 11:28.771
and those ladies need to know
I am perfectly capable...

11:28.772 --> 11:29.897
You realize that Armstrong woman

11:29.898 --> 11:31.775
is gonna be calling this house
ten times a day?

11:32.359 --> 11:34.528
You didn't give her
our phone number, did you?

11:36.071 --> 11:37.446
You promised
she would never have it.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.615
After Mrs Wendelken said that
I could just bring biscuits,

11:39.616 --> 11:40.867
it was all a blur.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.034
Now I guess I have to attend.

11:42.035 --> 11:45.413
And watch Charlie the shepherd
wearing my bathrobe again.

11:45.414 --> 11:48.040
Oh, no. Did somebody die?

11:48.041 --> 11:49.418
It's worse than that, son.

11:51.628 --> 11:55.132
Your mum is running
the Christmas pageant.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.676
I bet you all think
this is really funny,

11:58.677 --> 12:01.304
but the Christmas pageant
is a tradition,

12:01.305 --> 12:04.265
and it's important
and I can manage it just fine.

12:04.266 --> 12:06.601
In fact, I told Mrs Armstrong

12:06.602 --> 12:09.563
it's going to be the best
Christmas pageant ever.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.567
I wonder who that is.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.613
<i>This was not good.</i>

12:18.614 --> 12:20.948
<i>The pageant
had to be great this year</i>

12:20.949 --> 12:22.992
<i>and as much as I admired her
for stepping up,</i>

12:22.993 --> 12:25.203
<i>Mum had never done
anything like this before</i>

12:25.204 --> 12:27.747
<i>and didn't know what
or who she was up against.</i>

12:27.748 --> 12:30.750
<i>I couldn't stand to see her fail
in front of the whole town.</i>

12:30.751 --> 12:32.586
<i>- But...</i>
- You got this, Mum.

12:35.881 --> 12:39.008
God, please make it
a good pageant

12:39.009 --> 12:40.801
so Mum doesn't get blamed.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.803
<i>Now, why did I spend
so much time</i>

12:42.804 --> 12:44.847
<i>telling you
all about the Herdmans</i>

12:44.848 --> 12:47.850
<i>and our town's lather,
rinse, repeat Christmas pageant?</i>

12:47.851 --> 12:50.354
<i>What could one possibly
have to do with the other?</i>

12:51.438 --> 12:52.606
<i>You'll see.</i>

12:53.482 --> 12:55.858
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

12:55.859 --> 12:59.695
As you know, once a month,
we ask the Sunday School

12:59.696 --> 13:02.156
to be in service
for the first 15 minutes

13:02.157 --> 13:03.742
and do something special.

13:04.368 --> 13:08.580
Sing a song, act out a parable,
or recite some Bible verses.

13:09.248 --> 13:10.666
Before we bring them up,

13:11.500 --> 13:12.917
I'm sure you heard about

13:12.918 --> 13:16.088
Mrs Armstrong's
unfortunate accident.

13:16.755 --> 13:17.922
She is recovering.

13:17.923 --> 13:23.303
But I want to be sure to give
special mention to Grace,

13:23.971 --> 13:27.349
for volunteering
to direct the Christmas pageant.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.604
We are all very grateful,

13:33.605 --> 13:35.064
especially with
all the attention

13:35.065 --> 13:36.774
the pageant
is getting this year.

13:36.775 --> 13:39.152
So good luck. No pressure.

13:40.529 --> 13:42.280
All right, this month,

13:42.281 --> 13:43.865
Ms Warren asked the kids

13:43.866 --> 13:46.451
to share what they liked best
about church.

13:46.743 --> 13:47.744
Ms Warren.

13:48.412 --> 13:49.495
Go ahead, sweetie.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.164
So just up there.
Yep, big voice.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.333
What I like best
about Sunday School

13:54.334 --> 13:56.170
is the good feeling I get
when I go there.

14:01.592 --> 14:04.552
All right, Minnie, you're up.
Go ahead. Voice loud.

14:04.553 --> 14:07.806
I love to sing hymns,
and I love Jesus.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.018
So cute.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.270
Charlie, how 'bout you?

14:17.024 --> 14:19.526
What I like best
about church is...

14:20.527 --> 14:22.738
there aren't any Herdmans here.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.418
Charlie'll tell you some
other things he likes next time.

14:39.171 --> 14:40.714
Happy Sunday.

14:44.259 --> 14:47.261
What?
There are other things I like,

14:47.262 --> 14:49.639
but she said,
"What you like best."

14:49.640 --> 14:53.059
And what I like best
is no Herdmans.

14:53.060 --> 14:56.771
Hey, that's not a very
Christian sentiment.

14:56.772 --> 14:59.733
It's the truth. And you say,
"Always tell the truth."

15:03.862 --> 15:06.405
When your dad says that,

15:06.406 --> 15:09.910
he means not
at the expense of kindness.

15:10.661 --> 15:12.703
- Nailed it.
- Pulled that out of your...

15:12.704 --> 15:15.039
<i>The truth was,
the last three days in a row,</i>

15:15.040 --> 15:18.502
<i>Leroy Herdman stole the dessert
from Charlie's lunch box.</i>

15:20.212 --> 15:21.420
Give it up, Charlie!

15:21.421 --> 15:24.758
<i>Why Charlie? I guess
it was his turn this month.</i>

15:34.142 --> 15:36.854
<i>Day three of the siege,
Charlie surrendered.</i>

15:37.479 --> 15:40.065
Fine, take it. I don't care.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.984
I get all the snacks I want
from church, anyway.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.944
What kinds of snacks?

15:44.945 --> 15:50.741
Chocolate cake, sweetie bars,
biscuits, Kool-Aid, ice cream,

15:50.742 --> 15:53.495
doughnuts, popcorn balls.

15:54.079 --> 15:57.665
So go ahead. Church gives me
everything I need.

15:57.666 --> 15:59.292
Too bad you'll never know.

15:59.293 --> 16:02.004
You'd melt if you ever
showed up in a church.

16:03.005 --> 16:06.592
<i>Charlie's lie couldn't have
backfired more spectacularly.</i>

16:07.551 --> 16:09.427
<i>That Sunday was our food drive.</i>

16:09.428 --> 16:11.013
Good morning. Thank you
for coming. Nice to see you.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.014
Hello.

16:13.015 --> 16:15.309
Good to see you.
Thank you for coming.

16:19.271 --> 16:21.397
You sure we got the right place?

16:21.398 --> 16:22.524
They're here.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.110
Oh, my goodness.

16:26.278 --> 16:27.362
We can do this.

16:28.739 --> 16:30.323
Just keep smiling.

16:30.324 --> 16:32.743
- Where do you get the cake?
- Cake?

16:34.870 --> 16:35.912
Yeah. Right over there,
that's it.

16:35.913 --> 16:38.623
Good idea, Leroy.
We can work with this.

16:38.624 --> 16:40.875
Are you here for Sunday School?

16:40.876 --> 16:44.921
A-ha! More school, he says.
I knew there'd be a catch.

16:44.922 --> 16:46.464
Come on, let's get outta here.

16:46.465 --> 16:48.926
No, no, no.
It's not like regular school.

16:49.760 --> 16:53.137
You'll learn about Jesus
and you'll sing songs about Him.

16:53.138 --> 16:55.223
- Are your parents here?
- Mum's working.

16:55.224 --> 16:57.058
We were told
there'd be desserts.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.101
Free desserts to anyone
who wants 'em.

16:59.102 --> 17:02.480
I'm sure I could rustle you up
something special

17:02.481 --> 17:04.691
after service,
if you'd like to stay.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.069
I will show you where it is.

17:11.406 --> 17:12.405
Oh, boy.

17:12.406 --> 17:16.411
<i>Jesus loves me, this I know</i>

17:17.119 --> 17:20.915
<i>For the Bible tells me so</i>

17:24.545 --> 17:25.796
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

17:28.590 --> 17:31.760
Beth, you'd be happy
to have them sit by you, right?

17:33.679 --> 17:35.264
Great. Come now.

17:49.403 --> 17:51.071
Well, we haven't melted yet.

17:52.281 --> 17:53.322
<i>So they stayed.</i>

17:53.323 --> 17:55.283
<i>Jesus loves me...</i>

17:55.284 --> 17:57.910
<i>They didn't sing any hymns.</i>

17:57.911 --> 17:59.871
<i>For the Bible...</i>

17:59.872 --> 18:01.289
Our Father, who art in heaven...

18:01.290 --> 18:02.457
<i>...or say prayers.</i>

18:03.876 --> 18:05.294
Baby Jesus...

18:07.004 --> 18:09.298
<i>But they did practise
their drawing skills.</i>

18:17.139 --> 18:18.765
<i>And made a little money.</i>

18:20.142 --> 18:21.392
All right, kids.

18:21.393 --> 18:23.394
We're going to be starting
rehearsals soon

18:23.395 --> 18:25.188
for our Christmas pageant.

18:25.189 --> 18:27.815
So please be sure
to let your parents know

18:27.816 --> 18:30.276
they'll need to stay after
church with you next week

18:30.277 --> 18:31.694
for all the details.

18:31.695 --> 18:34.071
I do hope you'll be
in the choir again this year.

18:34.072 --> 18:36.741
- Your voice, it's so...
- Grief, Alice.

18:36.742 --> 18:38.034
I'm not gonna try and play Mary

18:38.035 --> 18:40.203
just because my mum's
running the pageant.

18:40.204 --> 18:42.747
We want all of you to be there.

18:42.748 --> 18:44.957
Hey, what's a pageant?

18:44.958 --> 18:46.584
- It's a play.
- A play?

18:46.585 --> 18:48.503
You know, like a film.

18:48.504 --> 18:50.839
- But in front of people.
- A film, huh?

18:52.966 --> 18:54.885
<i>The Herdmans
were big filmgoers.</i>

18:56.428 --> 18:57.595
Come here, you little...

18:57.596 --> 18:58.930
<i>Though they never paid
their own way.</i>

18:58.931 --> 19:01.265
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Stop! Stop! Stop!

19:01.266 --> 19:03.684
Hey. Hey, hey, hey...
Don't... Stop. Stop.

19:03.685 --> 19:06.229
Stop fighting. Hey!
Hey, hey. Okay. Okay.

19:06.230 --> 19:07.814
Hey! Enough! Dude. Hey!

19:19.076 --> 19:20.701
Everyone shows up to watch.

19:20.702 --> 19:22.120
It's about Jesus.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.709
Everything here is.

19:28.544 --> 19:29.627
<i>After that comment,</i>

19:29.628 --> 19:31.964
<i>I figured she didn't care much
about the Christmas pageant.</i>

19:32.339 --> 19:33.339
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

19:33.340 --> 19:35.091
And at summer camp,
they have a super-fast boat.

19:35.092 --> 19:37.009
It's way faster than a car.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.427
I've only ever been on a canoe.

19:38.428 --> 19:40.304
And then there's this raft
we dive off of.

19:40.305 --> 19:42.682
- I can do the swan dive.
- Sounds fun.

19:42.683 --> 19:44.184
And then you get eaten
by a bear.

19:46.144 --> 19:49.898
So, Nits, Wallflower,
you ready for this?

19:50.649 --> 19:52.234
I'm gonna be in your pageant
this year.

19:53.527 --> 19:55.653
- You're what?
- Nits heard me.

19:55.654 --> 19:57.030
I'm gonna be in your Bible play.

19:57.906 --> 20:00.616
What?
You can't be in the pageant.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.786
I'm gonna be Baby Jesus's mum.

20:03.495 --> 20:05.955
You're too dirty to play Mary,
Imogene Herdman.

20:05.956 --> 20:07.498
Everyone knows.

20:07.499 --> 20:08.584
Alice!

20:09.626 --> 20:12.670
- Who's Mary?
- Baby Jesus's mum.

20:12.671 --> 20:14.672
Which everyone knows except you.

20:14.673 --> 20:16.382
And I'm always Mary
in the pageant

20:16.383 --> 20:18.510
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

20:20.095 --> 20:23.223
Sweetie, you're gonna tell 'em
you don't wanna do it.

20:23.974 --> 20:25.349
You want me to be Mary.

20:25.350 --> 20:26.976
And why would I do that?

20:26.977 --> 20:29.353
'Cause if you don't,
then next spring,

20:29.354 --> 20:31.397
when the pussy willows come out,

20:31.398 --> 20:32.940
I'm gonna stick a pussy willow

20:32.941 --> 20:34.942
so far down
your pretty little ear,

20:34.943 --> 20:36.570
they won't be able
to get it out.

20:37.237 --> 20:40.907
It'll sprout there
and grow and grow.

20:40.908 --> 20:42.700
And you'll spend
the rest of your life

20:42.701 --> 20:45.871
with a pussy willow bush
growing right out of your head.

20:47.372 --> 20:49.373
<i>Believe it or not,
she'd done it before.</i>

20:49.374 --> 20:52.419
- Get off me! Ow!
- Okay. Just one sec. One sec.

20:55.589 --> 20:56.590
What?

21:05.849 --> 21:07.475
What are you lookin' at?

21:07.476 --> 21:10.603
Why would you even
want to be in the pageant?

21:10.604 --> 21:11.772
None of your business.

21:22.574 --> 21:24.116
<i>While the little kids
were all tired,</i>

21:24.117 --> 21:25.785
<i>and the big kids
were all hungry,</i>

21:25.786 --> 21:28.246
<i>and the mothers all wanted
to go home and cook dinner</i>

21:28.247 --> 21:29.872
<i>and the fathers
all wanted to go home</i>

21:29.873 --> 21:31.249
<i>and watch the game on TV,</i>

21:31.250 --> 21:35.336
<i>the Herdmans sat quietly,
waiting for my mum to begin.</i>

21:35.337 --> 21:39.257
<i>And I was praying for a miracle
that Imogene would stay quiet</i>

21:39.258 --> 21:40.967
<i>and the Herdmans wouldn't burn
anything down</i>

21:40.968 --> 21:42.218
<i>and ruin my mum's rehearsal</i>

21:42.219 --> 21:44.137
<i>and embarrass us
in front of everyone.</i>

21:45.514 --> 21:47.266
<i>Okay, that's three miracles.</i>

21:50.686 --> 21:52.020
Well, hello, everyone.

21:54.022 --> 21:55.774
This won't take very long.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.526
All right, just a moment.

21:58.527 --> 22:02.905
This is from
a lot of calls this week.

22:02.906 --> 22:03.991
Okay.

22:04.783 --> 22:08.035
First, as Mrs Armstrong
always says,

22:08.036 --> 22:11.498
"There are no small parts,
only small actors."

22:15.169 --> 22:16.170
What does that mean?

22:17.379 --> 22:18.839
I honestly don't know.

22:20.090 --> 22:21.841
Okay, we don't have
many rehearsals,

22:21.842 --> 22:24.136
so you must all try
to be present at every one.

22:25.971 --> 22:28.724
- What if we get sick?
- You won't get sick.

22:30.100 --> 22:33.019
Now, you little children
over here,

22:33.020 --> 22:34.396
you will be angels.

22:35.397 --> 22:37.106
"The older boys and girls
will be shepherds

22:37.107 --> 22:40.110
"and guests at the inn
and members of the choir.

22:40.903 --> 22:42.653
"And we need Mary and Joseph,

22:42.654 --> 22:45.573
"the Three Wise Men,
and the Angel of the Lord.

22:45.574 --> 22:49.785
"They aren't hard parts,
but they're important parts.

22:49.786 --> 22:53.998
"So those kids must absolutely
come to every rehearsal." Oh.

22:53.999 --> 22:55.625
What if they get sick?

22:55.626 --> 22:58.002
- They won't get sick either.
- But what if they do?

22:58.003 --> 22:59.505
Nobody is getting sick, David.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.465
"We always start with Mary.

23:02.466 --> 23:05.092
"We must choose Mary carefully

23:05.093 --> 23:08.471
"because Mary
is the mother of Jesus.

23:08.472 --> 23:12.476
"She should be a sweet,
happy little girl, who..."

23:13.936 --> 23:16.355
Okay, enough of this.

23:17.356 --> 23:20.358
I know many of you would like
to play Mary in our pageant,

23:20.359 --> 23:22.652
but we only need one.

23:22.653 --> 23:24.278
Imogene, do you have a question?

23:24.279 --> 23:27.073
No. I wanna be Mary.

23:27.074 --> 23:28.784
And Ralph wants to be Joe.

23:29.535 --> 23:31.452
<i>It was like a detective film</i>

23:31.453 --> 23:34.121
<i>where a nice little old lady
shoves a gun in the bank window</i>

23:34.122 --> 23:35.373
<i>and says,
"Give me all your money,"</i>

23:35.374 --> 23:36.874
<i>and you can't believe it.</i>

23:36.875 --> 23:38.835
<i>My mother couldn't believe it.</i>

23:38.836 --> 23:41.004
We have to give
everyone a chance.

23:41.922 --> 23:44.216
Does anyone else
wanna volunteer for Joseph?

23:46.510 --> 23:49.470
Elmer? You usually
like playing Joseph.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.597
<i>Elmer hated playing Joseph.</i>

23:51.598 --> 23:53.057
<i>But his dad was the minister,</i>

23:53.058 --> 23:54.893
<i>so he made him
when nobody else volunteered.</i>

23:56.603 --> 23:58.981
<i>Nobody else ever volunteered.</i>

24:00.607 --> 24:03.819
Well, that's very surprising.
Anybody else?

24:06.321 --> 24:07.322
All right.

24:08.407 --> 24:10.575
Ralph will be our Joseph.

24:10.576 --> 24:13.328
Would anyone else
like to volunteer for Mary?

24:14.288 --> 24:16.331
Alice, don't you want to
volunteer this year?

24:18.292 --> 24:19.626
No.

24:23.380 --> 24:24.714
Anybody?

24:24.715 --> 24:27.675
<i>Mum was in a terrible spot.
The worst.</i>

24:27.676 --> 24:31.721
<i>The parents, the pageant,
the church, the whole town,</i>

24:31.722 --> 24:34.308
<i>they'd blame Mum
if the pageant imploded.</i>

24:34.975 --> 24:36.435
<i>Would I step up to help?</i>

24:37.728 --> 24:39.979
<i>What I would do next
would determine</i>

24:39.980 --> 24:42.649
<i>the fate of the pageant
to this very day.</i>

24:51.366 --> 24:52.367
Okay.

24:53.035 --> 24:56.121
Imogene will be our Mary.

25:00.751 --> 25:03.252
We have Wise Men next.

25:03.253 --> 25:05.213
Leroy, Claude and Ollie
wanna play them.

25:05.214 --> 25:08.174
Okay, now we have to give
everyone a chance, Imogene.

25:08.175 --> 25:10.426
Everyone's had their chance.

25:10.427 --> 25:12.721
They've had
all kinds of chances.

25:13.305 --> 25:15.389
- And the Angel of the Lord?
- Gladys.

25:15.390 --> 25:16.683
Me!

25:19.228 --> 25:21.438
Robby! Robby!

25:22.648 --> 25:23.649
Michelle.

25:24.566 --> 25:25.776
You raise that hand.

25:27.736 --> 25:29.530
Suppose that's that, then.

25:31.865 --> 25:33.282
We need the shepherds.

25:33.283 --> 25:34.660
Charlie, you're in.

25:35.327 --> 25:36.410
David and Robby?

25:36.411 --> 25:39.747
I just remembered,
we're going to Philadelphia.

25:39.748 --> 25:42.375
- We are not!
- I'll probably be sick.

25:42.376 --> 25:44.585
I'll put you both down
for probably.

25:44.586 --> 25:46.838
Mum, Gladys Herdman
hits too hard.

25:46.839 --> 25:49.799
My goodness, Gladys isn't going
to hit anyone.

25:49.800 --> 25:50.884
What an idea!

25:51.802 --> 25:54.595
The Angel of the Lord visits
the shepherds in the field

25:54.596 --> 25:56.681
and tells them
that Jesus is born.

25:56.682 --> 25:58.057
And hits them.

25:58.058 --> 26:00.059
I don't wanna hear
another word about it.

26:00.060 --> 26:02.395
No shepherds
will quit or get sick.

26:02.396 --> 26:03.981
Or go to Philadelphia.

26:04.648 --> 26:05.649
Ow!

26:07.025 --> 26:10.862
<i>I felt terrible for my mum.
And some of it was my fault.</i>

26:10.863 --> 26:13.823
<i>Here she was, five minutes
into covering for Mrs Armstrong</i>

26:13.824 --> 26:16.784
<i>and the Herdmans had hijacked
the entire pageant.</i>

26:16.785 --> 26:19.495
<i>I'd been afraid
it'd be the same old thing,</i>

26:19.496 --> 26:22.207
<i>and now I'd do anything for it
to be boring again.</i>

26:24.585 --> 26:26.794
<i>Word about what happened
spread faster</i>

26:26.795 --> 26:28.714
<i>than a Herdman-set grass fire.</i>

26:29.339 --> 26:31.924
<i>Kids told their parents,
parents called their neighbours</i>

26:31.925 --> 26:33.802
<i>and neighbours
called their relatives.</i>

26:42.728 --> 26:45.355
How could you let this happen?
How could...

26:46.940 --> 26:47.941
How could...

26:48.901 --> 26:49.902
How could...

26:50.611 --> 26:52.570
Does anyone have a paper bag?

26:52.571 --> 26:53.905
It's not fair
that a whole family

26:53.906 --> 26:55.156
who doesn't even
go to our church

26:55.157 --> 26:57.033
just barged in and took over
the pageant.

26:57.034 --> 26:58.618
Injustice was done.

26:58.619 --> 27:01.580
We all agree it was a travesty.

27:02.581 --> 27:05.082
Because the Herdmans volunteered
for the pageant?

27:05.083 --> 27:07.293
She is referring
to the grievous assault

27:07.294 --> 27:09.296
on the impartial
casting process yesterday.

27:09.922 --> 27:13.090
With all due respect,
nothing about the process

27:13.091 --> 27:15.177
has ever been impartial,
Mrs Armstrong.

27:16.053 --> 27:18.638
And as for a grievous assault,

27:18.639 --> 27:22.225
I literally pleaded with
your children to participate.

27:22.226 --> 27:24.436
We were paralysed with shock.

27:25.020 --> 27:26.021
But you spoke.

27:26.980 --> 27:28.190
It came in waves.

27:30.859 --> 27:33.069
I'm sorry, but we're using

27:33.070 --> 27:35.112
really big words
to talk about a pageant

27:35.113 --> 27:37.198
where the kids
just have to stand

27:37.199 --> 27:39.700
in the same spot
they stand in every year.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.161
We take it seriously.

27:42.371 --> 27:45.957
So do I, Mrs Slocum,
that's why I volunteered.

27:45.958 --> 27:49.503
Judging by who you cast as Mary,
you apparently don't.

27:51.171 --> 27:52.214
Rebecca,

27:52.923 --> 27:55.132
is it possible that,
as Alice's mum,

27:55.133 --> 27:57.553
you have a personal interest
in who plays Mary?

27:58.387 --> 27:59.805
The pageant is sacred.

28:00.430 --> 28:01.431
Wait.

28:02.224 --> 28:03.933
The pageant is sacred?

28:03.934 --> 28:06.102
- Obviously.
- It's about community.

28:06.103 --> 28:07.937
- And fundraising.
- And Mother Mary.

28:07.938 --> 28:10.481
- And tradition.
- What do you all suggest?

28:10.482 --> 28:13.067
That I kick the Herdmans
out of the Christmas pageant

28:13.068 --> 28:14.862
and keep them out of the church?

28:15.904 --> 28:17.030
Yes.

28:33.922 --> 28:35.257
I mean,
I can't just kick 'em out.

28:36.258 --> 28:39.051
But they're right. It might be
a disaster with the Herdmans.

28:39.052 --> 28:41.971
Now, that's a pageant
I'd actually like to see.

28:41.972 --> 28:43.890
Mother Mary puffin' on a cigar,

28:43.891 --> 28:46.601
the shepherds clobbering
each other with their hooks.

28:46.602 --> 28:48.478
Five bucks say
they burn down the manger.

28:49.354 --> 28:50.521
Why'd you have to tell 'em

28:50.522 --> 28:52.356
they'd get food at church, dummy?

28:52.357 --> 28:53.566
'Cause I didn't think
they'd actually

28:53.567 --> 28:55.109
walk into a church building!

28:55.110 --> 28:56.987
I'm surprised
they didn't burst into flames.

28:57.988 --> 28:59.698
Sorry I didn't volunteer.

29:01.325 --> 29:02.492
Did I ruin the pageant?

29:03.076 --> 29:06.455
Oh, my goodness, no! Honey...

29:08.165 --> 29:11.792
Beth, I will tell you
what I told those condescending,

29:11.793 --> 29:13.920
hyper-controlling
busybodies from church,

29:13.921 --> 29:15.546
that while Helen Armstrong
might be surprised

29:15.547 --> 29:16.839
the sun rises every morning

29:16.840 --> 29:18.508
even though she's not there
to supervise it,

29:18.509 --> 29:20.134
she is not the only woman
in the world

29:20.135 --> 29:21.636
who can run a Christmas pageant.

29:21.637 --> 29:23.304
And if they don't think
I can do it,

29:23.305 --> 29:24.972
they are in for a big lesson.

29:24.973 --> 29:26.350
You said all that?

29:27.267 --> 29:29.060
Well, not all of it.

29:29.061 --> 29:30.979
- Any of it?
- Never mind.

29:32.356 --> 29:34.398
<i>It was the night
of the first rehearsal.</i>

29:34.399 --> 29:37.193
<i>The big night for Mum to prove
she could make this work.</i>

29:37.194 --> 29:39.737
<i>I was ready to help
in any way I could.</i>

29:39.738 --> 29:42.031
<i>But first, as usual,
the kids were sent outside</i>

29:42.032 --> 29:44.116
<i>while the parents
had prayer time together.</i>

29:44.117 --> 29:46.786
<i>I think it was less about prayer
than that they wanted us all</i>

29:46.787 --> 29:49.372
<i>to get our energy out
so we'd behave later.</i>

29:49.373 --> 29:50.666
<i>But then...</i>

30:04.179 --> 30:05.347
Now.

30:22.865 --> 30:23.866
Stop.

30:25.826 --> 30:28.744
Hey, kids. They'll be ready
for you in a minute.

30:28.745 --> 30:30.205
Have a good rehearsal.

30:51.643 --> 30:53.686
<i>The first rehearsal
was usually about as much fun</i>

30:53.687 --> 30:55.646
<i>as a three-hour ride
on the school bus.</i>

30:55.647 --> 30:57.982
<i>And just as noisy and crowded.</i>

30:57.983 --> 31:01.194
<i>But after what we'd just faced,
no one made a sound</i>

31:01.195 --> 31:03.029
<i>and we just waited
quietly to see</i>

31:03.030 --> 31:05.656
<i>what awful thing
the Herdmans might do next.</i>

31:05.657 --> 31:08.117
This is why they shouldn't
have shown up.

31:08.118 --> 31:10.328
Didn't Reverend Hopkins
talk about when Jesus said,

31:10.329 --> 31:12.371
"Suffer the little children
come unto me"?

31:12.372 --> 31:14.416
Yeah, well, Jesus wouldn't have
suffered Herdmans.

31:15.292 --> 31:16.835
- Okay.
- Mum?

31:17.961 --> 31:19.504
Do you need help with anything?

31:19.505 --> 31:21.673
Today, we're going to ignore
everything except blood.

31:22.633 --> 31:24.927
I'm gonna start soon. Now,
go sit down next to Imogene.

31:26.345 --> 31:27.346
Mum!

31:28.722 --> 31:31.016
Your quiet might rub off on her.

31:36.438 --> 31:38.398
Okay, quiet down, everyone.

31:40.859 --> 31:42.611
Good, then.

31:44.071 --> 31:45.071
Okay.

31:45.072 --> 31:49.033
Welcome, everyone.
We're glad to see all of you.

31:49.034 --> 31:50.993
<i>That might've been
the biggest lie ever said</i>

31:50.994 --> 31:52.495
<i>right out loud in the church.</i>

31:52.496 --> 31:53.871
First, the easy part.

31:53.872 --> 31:55.790
Let's separate
everyone into angels

31:55.791 --> 31:58.334
and shepherds
and guests at the inn.

31:58.335 --> 32:00.670
Who were the shepherds?
Where'd they come from?

32:00.671 --> 32:02.380
- What's an inn?
- It's like a motel

32:02.381 --> 32:04.090
where people go
to spend the night.

32:04.091 --> 32:05.591
What people? Jesus?

32:05.592 --> 32:08.427
Oh, honestly!
Jesus wasn't even born yet!

32:08.428 --> 32:10.263
Mary and Joseph went there.

32:10.264 --> 32:12.181
- Why?
- What happened first?

32:12.182 --> 32:14.518
- Begin at the beginning.
- The very beginning?

32:15.102 --> 32:17.311
<i>That really scared everyone
because the beginning</i>

32:17.312 --> 32:19.063
<i>would be</i> The Book of Genesis,

32:19.064 --> 32:20.857
<i>where it says
"In the beginning."</i>

32:20.858 --> 32:23.068
<i>And if we started there,
we'd be here for years.</i>

32:23.735 --> 32:26.405
Let's start at the beginning
of the Christmas story.

32:27.739 --> 32:30.741
We've all heard it
a million times.

32:30.742 --> 32:33.328
I think it's a good idea
for all of us to hear it again.

32:33.829 --> 32:36.373
It's a good reminder
of what Christmas is all about.

32:37.583 --> 32:39.876
"And Joseph also
went up from Galilee,

32:39.877 --> 32:42.837
"out of the city of Nazareth
into Judea,

32:42.838 --> 32:46.175
"unto the city of David,
which is called Bethlehem,

32:46.633 --> 32:49.343
"because he was of the house
and lineage of David,

32:49.344 --> 32:53.431
"to be taxed with Mary,
his espoused wife,

32:53.432 --> 32:55.391
"being great with child."

32:55.392 --> 32:58.102
- "Great with child"?
- Pregnant, stupid.

32:58.103 --> 32:59.187
Ralph, that's enough.

32:59.188 --> 33:01.522
It's not very nice to say that
Mary was pregnant.

33:01.523 --> 33:03.107
My mother wouldn't want us
talking about that.

33:03.108 --> 33:04.192
<i>It was true.</i>

33:04.193 --> 33:05.818
<i>Mrs Wendelken didn't like</i>

33:05.819 --> 33:07.904
<i>cats having kittens
or birds laying eggs,</i>

33:07.905 --> 33:11.032
<i>and she didn't let Alice play
with anyone who had two rabbits.</i>

33:11.033 --> 33:12.117
Will ya shut up?

33:12.993 --> 33:14.243
I wanna hear.

33:14.244 --> 33:15.620
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

33:15.621 --> 33:18.164
<i>The Herdmans were famous
for never sitting still</i>

33:18.165 --> 33:20.374
<i>and never paying attention
to anyone,</i>

33:20.375 --> 33:22.835
<i>teachers, parents, police.</i>

33:22.836 --> 33:25.296
<i>Yet something about
the Christmas story</i>

33:25.297 --> 33:27.215
<i>had them hanging on every word.</i>

33:27.216 --> 33:29.550
Mary and Joseph
had to go in the stable

33:29.551 --> 33:33.221
because there was no room
for them at the inn.

33:33.222 --> 33:36.182
My God! Not even for Jesus?

33:36.183 --> 33:38.851
We don't use God's name
that way, Imogene.

33:38.852 --> 33:42.438
What's a manger?
Is that like a bed for the baby?

33:42.439 --> 33:44.190
Why would they have
a bed in a barn?

33:44.191 --> 33:46.943
Well, that's the point,
actually, Leroy.

33:46.944 --> 33:48.945
They didn't have
a bed in a barn.

33:48.946 --> 33:50.446
They had to use
whatever was there.

33:50.447 --> 33:52.657
What would you do
if you had a new baby

33:52.658 --> 33:54.200
and no bed to put the baby in?

33:54.201 --> 33:55.827
We put Gladys
in a drawer.

33:57.746 --> 33:59.288
There you go.

33:59.289 --> 34:00.581
Mary put the Baby Jesus

34:00.582 --> 34:02.875
in a stone feeding trough
for animals.

34:02.876 --> 34:04.503
What were the wadded up clothes?

34:05.379 --> 34:07.713
You said she wrapped Him
in wadded-up clothes.

34:07.714 --> 34:09.132
Swaddling clothes.

34:10.217 --> 34:13.302
They used to wrap their babies
tightly in a big piece of fabric

34:13.303 --> 34:14.553
so they couldn't move around.

34:14.554 --> 34:17.390
They tied Him up
and put Him in a box?

34:17.391 --> 34:18.891
Where was Child Welfare?

34:22.312 --> 34:25.189
"And, lo, the Angel of the Lord
came upon them

34:25.190 --> 34:28.024
"and the glory of the Lord
shone round about them."

34:28.025 --> 34:29.277
Shazam!

34:30.279 --> 34:31.279
Shazam?

34:31.280 --> 34:32.738
Out of the black night

34:32.739 --> 34:36.242
with horrible vengeance,
the Mighty Marvo!

34:36.243 --> 34:38.245
That's the most
she's ever spoke.

34:39.621 --> 34:41.247
It's a comic book.

34:41.248 --> 34:42.666
Oh.

34:43.292 --> 34:45.584
Well, then, yes.

34:45.585 --> 34:47.086
I think the Angel of the Lord

34:47.087 --> 34:49.255
is kind of like
a comic book hero.

34:51.592 --> 34:55.845
"Now, when Jesus was born
in Bethlehem of Judea,

34:55.846 --> 34:59.557
"in the days of Herod the King,
behold,

34:59.558 --> 35:03.144
"there came Wise Men
from the east to Jerusalem."

35:03.145 --> 35:06.355
That's you, Leroy.
Claude, Ollie, pay attention.

35:06.356 --> 35:09.066
Wise how?
They teachers or somethin'?

35:09.067 --> 35:11.027
No, dumbbell,
they're like presidents.

35:11.028 --> 35:12.112
Let's not hit.

35:13.030 --> 35:15.448
But that's close.
They were kings.

35:15.449 --> 35:16.741
Well, it's about time.

35:16.742 --> 35:20.369
Maybe someone'll finally tell
that innkeeper where to get off

35:20.370 --> 35:22.247
and get the baby
out of the barn.

35:25.125 --> 35:26.834
"And when they were come
into the house,

35:26.835 --> 35:28.628
"they saw the young child

35:28.629 --> 35:30.379
"with Mary, His mother,

35:30.380 --> 35:32.632
"and fell down
and worshipped Him.

35:32.633 --> 35:34.342
"And when they had
opened their treasures,

35:34.343 --> 35:39.889
"they presented unto Him gifts,
gold, frankincense, and myrrh."

35:39.890 --> 35:41.933
Hold on. What's that stuff?

35:41.934 --> 35:43.643
Oils and perfume.

35:43.644 --> 35:47.772
Oil? What sort of cheap king
hands out oil?

35:47.773 --> 35:50.650
You'd get better presents
at the firemen's shelter.

35:50.651 --> 35:53.486
It was King Herod, actually.

35:53.487 --> 35:56.614
He sent the Wise Men
to find the Baby Jesus.

35:56.615 --> 35:59.242
Was it him that sent
the crummy presents?

35:59.243 --> 36:00.993
It was worse than that, actually.

36:00.994 --> 36:03.663
Herod planned on putting
the Baby Jesus to death.

36:03.664 --> 36:05.373
- My God!
- Imogene.

36:05.374 --> 36:06.791
Who's playing this Herod, anyway?

36:06.792 --> 36:08.709
We don't show Herod
in our pageant.

36:08.710 --> 36:10.753
- What?
- What?

36:10.754 --> 36:12.588
- Come on!
- No!

36:12.589 --> 36:14.674
You gotta show him getting
beat up in the end.

36:14.675 --> 36:15.758
Charlie can be Herod.

36:15.759 --> 36:17.635
- I don't wanna be Herod.
- No!

36:17.636 --> 36:19.220
Somebody oughta get
the innkeeper too.

36:19.221 --> 36:22.432
- Gladys, use your angel powers.
- No, honey, I don't think we...

36:27.354 --> 36:31.149
All right, that's enough.
That's enough! That's enough.

36:32.025 --> 36:33.360
Okay, okay.

36:36.280 --> 36:39.073
Please, I need you all
to settle down.

36:39.074 --> 36:41.410
- Maybe Jesus can kill Herod.
- Shazam!

37:03.140 --> 37:05.893
- Nice painting, huh?
- I guess.

37:08.103 --> 37:11.522
That Mary, she was a tough one.

37:11.523 --> 37:12.608
Tough?

37:13.400 --> 37:15.610
Yeah, she went
through quite a lot

37:15.611 --> 37:18.530
and overcame big challenges
to bring a child into the world.

37:21.408 --> 37:22.618
Doesn't look tough.

37:23.243 --> 37:24.995
Just looks sweet and pretty.

37:26.038 --> 37:28.582
Yeah. In that painting,
I guess, yeah.

37:31.126 --> 37:34.254
What do they have the name of
our town above the painting for?

37:35.088 --> 37:36.672
Do you know what Emmanuel means?

37:36.673 --> 37:37.758
No.

37:39.218 --> 37:40.761
It means "God with us."

37:42.179 --> 37:43.805
That's what Baby Jesus was.

37:44.806 --> 37:45.807
And you're...

37:47.184 --> 37:50.061
The character
you volunteered to play

37:50.062 --> 37:51.563
helped make that happen.

37:52.981 --> 37:53.982
Pretty neat.

37:56.276 --> 37:57.277
I guess.

38:01.532 --> 38:02.533
Anyways...

38:03.867 --> 38:04.868
look, I...

38:07.829 --> 38:11.333
You all asked
a lot of good questions tonight.

38:13.335 --> 38:16.046
And it made me wonder...

38:17.506 --> 38:20.174
if maybe you might enjoy
watching the Christmas pageant

38:20.175 --> 38:21.343
more than being in it.

38:23.011 --> 38:24.554
You know, you could really

38:24.555 --> 38:26.764
absorb it all,
see all the details.

38:26.765 --> 38:28.141
You know what I mean?

38:31.353 --> 38:33.564
No. I'm gonna do this.

38:37.276 --> 38:39.402
I think my character
should've set fire to that inn.

38:39.403 --> 38:40.695
Yeah. Maybe in the play,

38:40.696 --> 38:43.198
you can chase the innkeeper
to the next country.

38:46.201 --> 38:47.202
Imogene...

38:48.787 --> 38:50.663
I really need them to behave.

38:50.664 --> 38:52.456
If you could help me with that,

38:52.457 --> 38:54.000
I can make sure you have
all the dessert you want

38:54.001 --> 38:55.294
when the pageant is over.
What do you think?

38:56.587 --> 38:57.671
Heard that before.

38:59.756 --> 39:00.966
Imogene, let's go!

39:02.009 --> 39:03.010
Gotta go.

39:16.732 --> 39:17.816
Oh!

39:18.275 --> 39:20.986
- What happened to you?
- Herdmans.

39:22.112 --> 39:24.698
They tried to kill me... again.

39:25.449 --> 39:26.658
That's show business, pal.

39:34.249 --> 39:35.417
I'm at a loss.

39:36.043 --> 39:38.794
I don't see any bruises.
That's a victory.

39:38.795 --> 39:41.797
We didn't even rehearse. She
just told the Christmas story.

39:41.798 --> 39:43.299
The Herdmans had never heard it.

39:43.300 --> 39:45.343
Just suppose you didn't know
anything about it,

39:45.344 --> 39:46.802
and somebody told you.

39:46.803 --> 39:48.889
I'd be more confused
about Santa Claus.

39:50.807 --> 39:52.475
What would you think?

39:52.476 --> 39:54.810
Well, the whole thing's
a hospitality nightmare.

39:54.811 --> 39:56.854
Pretty pathetic that
a pregnant woman shows up

39:56.855 --> 39:58.940
and the only room you can find
for her is in the stable.

39:58.941 --> 40:00.816
That's exactly
what the Herdmans said.

40:00.817 --> 40:03.152
I never thought about it before.
It is pathetic.

40:03.153 --> 40:05.196
We hear all about
this warm stable

40:05.197 --> 40:07.616
with animals
and the sweet-smelling hay.

40:08.575 --> 40:10.077
My cousins grew up on a farm.

40:10.702 --> 40:12.370
Nothing sweet about that smell.

40:12.371 --> 40:14.205
I have to admit.

40:14.206 --> 40:17.708
Deep down, those kids
might just have good instincts.

40:17.709 --> 40:20.003
They wanted to burn
Herod alive, Mum.

40:21.421 --> 40:22.631
I said, "Deep down."

40:23.799 --> 40:26.551
They picked the right villain.
That's something, right?

40:26.552 --> 40:29.054
What did happen to Herod?
I don't even know.

40:31.265 --> 40:32.766
Who would be calling at this...

40:34.768 --> 40:36.394
- Mrs Armstrong.
- Mrs Armstrong.

40:36.395 --> 40:38.312
It's the fifth time this hour.

40:38.313 --> 40:41.315
Wendelken told her that you
haven't axed the Herdmans yet.

40:41.316 --> 40:43.402
She needs to know
what's taking so long.

40:45.028 --> 40:46.404
Sweetheart, the smell of this

40:46.405 --> 40:48.740
just reminds me
that you're busy.

40:50.701 --> 40:51.702
God...

40:53.203 --> 40:55.037
I just have a feeling

40:55.038 --> 40:57.124
this is gonna be
a real disaster.

40:59.751 --> 41:00.878
You awake, kiddo?

41:08.385 --> 41:10.052
How you doin' with all this?

41:10.053 --> 41:12.639
Are we sure Mum can't replace
the Herdmans?

41:13.265 --> 41:14.932
I think it's a little late
for that.

41:14.933 --> 41:18.520
And it's all my fault, because
I didn't raise my stupid hand.

41:19.396 --> 41:22.607
There was a man much
wiser than me that once said,

41:22.608 --> 41:25.484
"You can't add
a single hour to your life

41:25.485 --> 41:27.987
"by being anxious
about anything."

41:27.988 --> 41:29.865
And that includes putting on
a Christmas pageant.

41:30.282 --> 41:31.909
He hadn't met the Herdmans.

41:33.452 --> 41:34.453
Actually...

41:35.495 --> 41:37.080
he knows them
better than anyone.

41:37.873 --> 41:41.709
Anyway, would you come with me
in the morning to do something?

41:41.710 --> 41:43.045
What kinda something?

41:43.795 --> 41:46.380
Sort of an errand.

41:46.381 --> 41:48.049
I think it'd be good
for you to go.

41:48.050 --> 41:49.134
And the whole family.

41:49.718 --> 41:51.136
Somethin' I want you to see.

41:52.471 --> 41:53.472
Okay.

41:55.057 --> 41:56.266
Get some sleep.

41:56.975 --> 41:58.601
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

41:58.602 --> 42:00.728
Evan. You got it?

42:00.729 --> 42:01.813
Yeah.

42:06.777 --> 42:08.779
- Thanks, Bob.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

42:12.157 --> 42:14.451
- What's all this for?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

42:22.668 --> 42:24.418
I never knew you were
a Secret Santa.

42:24.419 --> 42:25.878
Well, it's not exactly a secret.

42:25.879 --> 42:27.713
The Church
Charitable Works Committee

42:27.714 --> 42:29.215
has been doing this for decades.

42:29.216 --> 42:32.802
It's a good way to get out of
our comfort zone and step up.

42:32.803 --> 42:34.345
Plus, I thought you all would be

42:34.346 --> 42:36.557
especially interested
in one of my stops.

42:45.816 --> 42:47.775
I think some of your classmates
live here.

42:47.776 --> 42:51.070
Really?
This is one of your stops?

42:51.071 --> 42:53.739
You never told me
you visited the Herdmans.

42:53.740 --> 42:55.284
Didn't seem of note
until this year.

42:55.993 --> 42:58.786
- Beth, you wanna come?
- That wouldn't be a good idea.

42:58.787 --> 43:00.413
Okay.

43:00.414 --> 43:03.917
But we all need to remember
Christmas comes for everyone.

43:24.563 --> 43:26.105
- It's the ham man!
- I want some!

43:26.106 --> 43:28.357
- It's ham day!
- Give me some ham! Give it!

43:28.358 --> 43:29.567
Ham day!

43:29.568 --> 43:31.195
Hey! Hey! Hey!

43:31.778 --> 43:33.613
That ham's for Christmas eatin'

43:33.614 --> 43:35.615
and if any of you
touch it before then,

43:35.616 --> 43:38.327
I will invent a torture
just for you!

43:40.829 --> 43:43.248
- Is your mum home?
- Not when the sun's up.

43:44.958 --> 43:48.085
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's fine. I know how to cook.

43:48.086 --> 43:49.171
I'm sure you do.

43:52.341 --> 43:54.885
Well, please let her know
I stopped by.

43:55.511 --> 43:56.970
I got the biggest ham
for you guys.

44:03.268 --> 44:04.603
Merry Christmas.

44:12.736 --> 44:14.070
Give it to me!
I want the first bite!

44:14.071 --> 44:16.739
Give it to me!
Back off, Imogene!

44:16.740 --> 44:17.908
Get off me, Ralph!

44:18.659 --> 44:20.536
Back up! Back up!

44:25.582 --> 44:27.416
No mum or dad home.

44:27.417 --> 44:28.835
Reverend Hopkins says
they don't know

44:28.836 --> 44:30.461
where their mum is
half the time.

44:30.462 --> 44:32.505
I heard, when Gladys turned two,

44:32.506 --> 44:34.674
Mr Herdman climbed
on a railroad train

44:34.675 --> 44:36.259
and never came back.

44:36.260 --> 44:39.137
- Nobody could blame him.
- All right, Beth, that's enough.

44:41.515 --> 44:43.976
I can't believe I listened
to those women.

44:45.435 --> 44:46.854
What's on your mind?

44:48.939 --> 44:50.439
What's on my mind is that

44:50.440 --> 44:53.192
Mrs Armstrong
and Mrs Wendelken

44:53.193 --> 44:55.445
and everyone else can stuff it.

44:56.613 --> 44:57.947
Whoa.

44:57.948 --> 44:59.032
After all,

44:59.950 --> 45:02.160
they raised their hands,
and no one else did.

45:03.161 --> 45:04.162
And that's that.

45:30.898 --> 45:32.231
Ow! What?

45:32.232 --> 45:33.859
How do you get a book
out of the library?

45:35.527 --> 45:36.819
Well, you have to have a card.

45:36.820 --> 45:38.529
- Do you have one?
- Yeah.

45:38.530 --> 45:39.615
Give it to me.

45:41.033 --> 45:43.284
It doesn't
really work like that.

45:43.285 --> 45:44.995
I'll be right with you.

45:46.330 --> 45:47.331
Oh, my.

45:48.790 --> 45:51.250
I don't keep any money here,
if that's what you're after.

45:51.251 --> 45:53.837
This is the library, right?
Where the books are?

45:54.922 --> 45:56.839
We need the one
with Jesus in it.

45:56.840 --> 45:58.424
And His mum.

45:58.425 --> 46:00.719
- And the Wise Men.
- And stupid Herod.

46:01.845 --> 46:03.262
It's the one they use in church.

46:03.263 --> 46:04.472
You mean the Bible?

46:04.473 --> 46:06.265
Hi, Mrs Graebner.

46:06.266 --> 46:09.018
Imogene and her brothers
would like to get library cards.

46:09.019 --> 46:10.103
Me too!

46:10.979 --> 46:12.063
And her sister.

46:12.064 --> 46:13.231
Beth!

46:13.232 --> 46:14.315
Oh, phew!

46:14.316 --> 46:16.275
- I thought that...
- Calm down, lady.

46:16.276 --> 46:17.819
We just need to look
some stuff up.

46:19.029 --> 46:22.573
Imogene and Ralph are playing
Mary and Joseph in the pageant.

46:22.574 --> 46:24.952
I'm aware. I bought tickets.

46:25.702 --> 46:27.954
Before I found out about it.

46:27.955 --> 46:29.622
They haven't
offered any refunds.

46:29.623 --> 46:33.584
And now, you want library cards?

46:33.585 --> 46:34.670
You?

46:36.129 --> 46:37.589
To check out Bibles?

46:39.341 --> 46:42.636
Now I've seen everything.
Herdmans in the library.

46:45.305 --> 46:47.683
There's the Christmas story.

46:49.268 --> 46:51.311
Where's the pictures?

47:01.697 --> 47:05.533
Some of these words are weird,
but this stuff is gold.

47:05.534 --> 47:08.911
- Ralph, go find a Herod book.
- How?

47:08.912 --> 47:10.204
I'll show you
the card catalogue.

47:10.205 --> 47:12.957
Don't buy anything!

47:12.958 --> 47:15.085
It's not that kind of catalogue.

47:18.297 --> 47:21.133
Beth's mum was right.
This Mary is kind of tough.

47:25.596 --> 47:28.264
<i>The Herdmans searched through
book after book,</i>

47:28.265 --> 47:30.474
<i>looking up every question
that came to mind.</i>

47:30.475 --> 47:33.019
<i>My fingers were sliced up
like a turkey sandwich</i>

47:33.020 --> 47:35.314
<i>from all the times I went back
to the card catalogue.</i>

47:46.617 --> 47:49.036
- Pictures.
- Pictures in lots of books.

47:50.537 --> 47:52.622
<i>I'd had plenty
of homework assignments</i>

47:52.623 --> 47:54.415
<i>where I had to go to the library</i>

47:54.416 --> 47:57.376
<i>but I don't think I was ever
as interested in anything</i>

47:57.377 --> 47:59.670
<i>as Imogene
was in the Christmas story.</i>

47:59.671 --> 48:01.297
Do you hear me?

48:01.298 --> 48:04.551
The shepherds were just minding
their business, and boom!

48:06.011 --> 48:08.721
Yeah, I get it.
We're Wise Men, though.

48:08.722 --> 48:10.598
We just walk up
with a box of junk.

48:10.599 --> 48:12.392
Why are you making us
do all this?

48:16.939 --> 48:19.232
Ollie, what's that film
you like with the whale?

48:19.233 --> 48:20.608
<i>Land Ho!</i>

48:20.609 --> 48:22.610
You think that captain guy
in <i>Land Ho!</i>

48:22.611 --> 48:24.403
just made up
how to build a raft?

48:24.404 --> 48:25.696
- No way.
- That's right.

48:25.697 --> 48:27.366
He had to read up.

48:28.075 --> 48:29.742
I thought we were
doing this for cake.

48:29.743 --> 48:31.327
It's about the cake, too.

48:31.328 --> 48:34.122
But it's also, like,
we get to make a film.

48:35.707 --> 48:38.418
In the films we watch,
the actress gets to...

48:40.087 --> 48:43.673
All the actors and actresses
get to be someone else.

48:43.674 --> 48:46.843
They get to change who they are
and live a different life.

48:46.844 --> 48:49.554
They can get away
from their miserable lives

48:49.555 --> 48:51.473
and become someone new.

48:52.349 --> 48:53.559
That's what we get to do.

48:56.144 --> 48:57.144
Yeah.

48:57.145 --> 49:00.064
So I get to be a king.

49:00.065 --> 49:02.525
Yeah. On Christmas Eve, you do.

49:02.526 --> 49:04.694
No way Gladys can be an angel.

49:04.695 --> 49:06.028
Yes, I can!

49:06.029 --> 49:07.447
You can at least try.

49:08.866 --> 49:12.369
Great. And I just get to be
some poor guy married to you.

49:14.872 --> 49:16.122
He's someone important enough

49:16.123 --> 49:17.790
that they wrote about him
in books.

49:17.791 --> 49:21.837
And I get to be
a sweet, pretty...

49:26.341 --> 49:28.259
Then we can get
all the food they got.

49:28.260 --> 49:31.305
Plus, now I got a book licence!

49:33.682 --> 49:34.850
You chokin' over there?

49:36.476 --> 49:37.560
I should go home.

49:37.561 --> 49:39.146
Nobody asked you to stay.

49:42.316 --> 49:43.817
Claude likes his licence.

49:44.735 --> 49:48.238
<i>That was about as close
to a thank you as I'd ever get.</i>

49:52.409 --> 49:54.494
Sorry I'm late.

49:55.329 --> 49:57.079
All right,
let's get into our groups.

49:57.080 --> 49:58.248
Angels, you are...

50:00.125 --> 50:03.128
Oh. Okay, good.
And everyone else...

50:05.339 --> 50:08.425
Well... thank you
for being on time.

50:09.885 --> 50:11.010
Yes, Claude?

50:11.011 --> 50:13.639
- Can we hang Herod?
- No, Claude.

50:15.390 --> 50:17.684
No one's going to die
in this pageant.

50:20.020 --> 50:21.687
We have a lot of work
to do tonight,

50:21.688 --> 50:23.857
- so let's get to it.
- Excuse me.

50:25.692 --> 50:28.570
Why are they still here?

50:29.196 --> 50:31.532
Because they're
in the pageant, Rebecca.

50:31.990 --> 50:33.658
And that's how
it's going to stay.

50:33.659 --> 50:34.825
Oh, really?

50:34.826 --> 50:36.536
And what would you like
me to tell

50:36.537 --> 50:39.539
Mrs Armstrong, Mrs Slocum
and the other mothers?

50:39.540 --> 50:40.748
You can tell them

50:40.749 --> 50:43.669
it's going to be the best
Christmas pageant ever.

50:44.378 --> 50:46.797
I'm gonna make it work
with the Herdmans.

50:48.090 --> 50:49.550
Places, everyone.

51:01.353 --> 51:03.604
Isn't the Angel of the Lord
supposed to say something?

51:03.605 --> 51:04.940
Hey!

51:06.358 --> 51:08.484
<i>Yeah, they were still Herdmans</i>

51:08.485 --> 51:09.819
<i>and some people</i>

51:09.820 --> 51:11.947
<i>were not going to forget that
for a minute.</i>

51:24.585 --> 51:25.711
Go. Go, go.

51:27.045 --> 51:28.671
Get away from the baby!

51:28.672 --> 51:31.716
Imogene, the Wise Men
are here to honour Him

51:31.717 --> 51:33.843
not harm Him, for heaven's sake.

51:33.844 --> 51:36.345
What if we didn't go home
a different way?

51:36.346 --> 51:38.556
What if we tell the king
where the baby was?

51:38.557 --> 51:41.727
- Old Herod would murder him.
- He would not!

51:42.436 --> 51:43.978
<i>I thought about it
later, though,</i>

51:43.979 --> 51:46.189
<i>and I decided
that if Herod, a king,</i>

51:46.190 --> 51:49.525
<i>set out to murder Jesus,
a carpenter's baby son,</i>

51:49.526 --> 51:52.111
<i>and he did know where he was,
he would do it.</i>

51:52.112 --> 51:54.447
<i>So, Leroy gave us something
to think about.</i>

51:54.448 --> 51:55.948
- Stop!
<i>- No Jesus. Ever.</i>

51:55.949 --> 51:57.783
Okay. Let's just take it down
a notch, okay?

51:57.784 --> 51:59.619
Stand up. Stand up.
I can't hear you guys

51:59.620 --> 52:01.037
when you're all talking at once.

52:01.038 --> 52:03.748
<i>Alice clearly didn't think
anything from the Herdmans</i>

52:03.749 --> 52:05.041
<i>was worth thinking about.</i>

52:05.042 --> 52:07.168
Is there a way
to make her smile?

52:07.169 --> 52:08.586
No, she doesn't do that.

52:08.587 --> 52:10.797
<i>But at least others
seemed to be trying...</i>

52:11.423 --> 52:13.592
<i>in unexpected ways.</i>

52:23.060 --> 52:24.895
Okay. Places, everyone!

52:27.481 --> 52:29.565
Who do I talk to about rewrites?

52:29.566 --> 52:31.902
I heard about rewrites
in the films.

52:37.157 --> 52:38.283
Okay, God.

52:39.326 --> 52:41.245
Now it's getting
even more scary.

52:42.538 --> 52:44.830
So please do something
to help Mum

52:44.831 --> 52:46.166
and save the pageant.

52:47.209 --> 52:48.210
That's all.

52:49.253 --> 52:50.254
Amen.

52:54.216 --> 52:55.341
<i>The last rehearsal</i>

52:55.342 --> 52:58.052
<i>was also the night
before the potluck supper.</i>

52:58.053 --> 53:00.471
<i>So the whole church
was full of kids and parents</i>

53:00.472 --> 53:02.515
<i>and the members
of the Potluck Committee.</i>

53:02.516 --> 53:06.143
<i>Which meant Mrs Slocum had
a chance to do a little spying</i>

53:06.144 --> 53:08.438
<i>to find something
to disapprove of.</i>

53:12.484 --> 53:13.944
Hello, Mrs Slocum.

53:14.528 --> 53:15.737
Hi!

53:17.030 --> 53:18.322
Sorry about all this.

53:18.323 --> 53:20.825
It's just, with so much to do
this time of year,

53:20.826 --> 53:23.160
the Potluck Committee
decided to come in tonight

53:23.161 --> 53:24.996
to get the food ready.

53:24.997 --> 53:26.414
I hope we won't bother you.

53:26.415 --> 53:27.498
You won't.

53:27.499 --> 53:28.749
We won't even be
near the kitchen.

53:28.750 --> 53:30.251
You won't even know we're here.

53:30.252 --> 53:31.669
<i>Mum was wrong.</i>

53:31.670 --> 53:34.423
<i>Everybody knew we were there
before the evening was over.</i>

53:35.382 --> 53:39.594
Okay, everybody,
this will be a dress rehearsal.

53:39.595 --> 53:40.970
Who knows what that means?

53:40.971 --> 53:42.555
- Costumes.
- Dress-up.

53:42.556 --> 53:44.974
Yes, for some of you.

53:44.975 --> 53:47.393
I don't have any kinda costume.

53:47.394 --> 53:51.022
Just wear your dad's bathrobe.
That's what I always do.

53:51.023 --> 53:52.607
My dad doesn't have a bathrobe.

53:52.608 --> 53:54.317
Then what does he wear
around the house?

53:54.318 --> 53:55.860
His underwear.

53:55.861 --> 53:56.944
All right.

53:56.945 --> 53:59.780
That's okay. This year,
because of the anniversary,

53:59.781 --> 54:02.159
Ladies Aid has helped
with nicer costumes.

54:08.165 --> 54:09.374
Yeah.

54:22.137 --> 54:23.639
You can be sweet.

54:26.767 --> 54:28.060
Hello, Imogene.

54:29.144 --> 54:31.021
Aren't you supposed to be
in costume?

54:31.647 --> 54:32.689
I will be.

54:33.315 --> 54:34.525
- I'm playing Mary.
- Oh.

54:35.943 --> 54:37.527
I couldn't tell.

54:37.528 --> 54:40.364
You don't look like any Mary
I've seen before.

54:43.534 --> 54:46.161
Well, gotta go prepare
the potluck dinner.

54:46.912 --> 54:49.039
It's for 500 people.

54:59.258 --> 55:01.217
It makes my eyes glow
in the light.

55:01.218 --> 55:04.095
Now, the main point
of a dress rehearsal

55:04.096 --> 55:05.555
isn't costumes.

55:05.556 --> 55:08.266
It's about getting through
the show without stopping.

55:08.267 --> 55:09.851
- Got it?
- Got it.

55:09.852 --> 55:11.102
- Got it.
- Okay.

55:11.103 --> 55:13.063
I'm gonna sit upstairs
in the audience.

55:15.399 --> 55:16.482
Take it away!

55:16.483 --> 55:17.693
Yay!

55:18.318 --> 55:19.319
Yes.

55:22.114 --> 55:23.365
Big smiles.

55:24.408 --> 55:25.784
Hang on to the railing.

55:26.994 --> 55:28.036
That's good.

55:29.121 --> 55:32.040
Oh, good grief.
Everyone, it's showtime!

55:33.208 --> 55:36.127
Imogene. What's wrong?
Where's your costume?

55:36.128 --> 55:37.629
Where's the baby?

55:38.714 --> 55:40.548
There is no baby.
We're using a doll.

55:40.549 --> 55:41.717
Yeah, I know.

55:42.259 --> 55:44.510
'Cause you couldn't get
a real one 'cause of me.

55:44.511 --> 55:46.305
- No.
<i>- It was true.</i>

55:47.055 --> 55:49.307
<i>We had lots of babies
offered in the beginning.</i>

55:49.308 --> 55:52.561
<i>All the way from Eugene Sloper,
who was a promising option,</i>

55:54.229 --> 55:57.648
<i>up to Junior Cottle,
who was almost four.</i>

55:57.649 --> 55:59.525
<i>His father said
he could scrunch up.</i>

55:59.526 --> 56:01.861
Heard we need a baby.
I can help.

56:01.862 --> 56:03.905
Really? That's great. Who?

56:03.906 --> 56:05.364
They've always got
two or three babies

56:05.365 --> 56:07.241
in carriages at the supermarket.

56:07.242 --> 56:08.535
I'll just take one.

56:09.536 --> 56:11.829
Imogene, I hope you're kidding.

56:11.830 --> 56:14.749
You know you can't just walk off
with someone's baby.

56:14.750 --> 56:16.709
<i>I doubt Imogene did know that.</i>

56:16.710 --> 56:18.754
<i>She walked off
with everything else.</i>

56:20.923 --> 56:23.424
<i>But when all the parents
heard about the Herdmans,</i>

56:23.425 --> 56:24.843
<i>they withdrew their babies.</i>

56:32.559 --> 56:34.101
<i>- We had hope.</i>
- Hello?

56:34.102 --> 56:36.437
<i>Bernice Toole was fostering
a three-month-old.</i>

56:36.438 --> 56:38.649
No, it doesn't matter
that she's Chinese!

56:39.358 --> 56:41.817
- Thank you, Bernice!
- Yes!

56:41.818 --> 56:43.402
<i>But then the baby got adopted</i>

56:43.403 --> 56:46.405
<i>and Bernice said it was too soon
to ask to borrow a kid back.</i>

56:46.406 --> 56:48.242
<i>- So, that was that.</i>
- Where is it?

56:49.743 --> 56:51.661
I think Beth brought it in
from the car.

56:51.662 --> 56:53.330
Let's go check with her.

56:53.914 --> 56:55.748
<i>Imogene's brothers
had hidden the doll</i>

56:55.749 --> 56:58.084
<i>because they didn't think
it looked like Jesus,</i>

56:58.085 --> 56:59.293
<i>whatever that meant.</i>

56:59.294 --> 57:01.964
<i>But after a fruitless search,
we had to start.</i>

57:03.465 --> 57:07.885
<i>- Away in a manger
- O little town of Bethlehem...</i>

57:07.886 --> 57:10.012
<i>- No crib for a bed...
- How still we see...</i>

57:10.013 --> 57:11.264
Stop. Stop.

57:11.265 --> 57:14.643
Back row,
"Away in a manger" comes first.

57:16.019 --> 57:17.478
I've got the baby.

57:17.479 --> 57:19.940
Finally. No thanks to you jerks.

57:20.566 --> 57:23.109
Don't touch him!
It's Baby Jesus.

57:23.110 --> 57:25.611
Now, Imogene, you're not
supposed to say anything.

57:25.612 --> 57:28.698
Then, Wise Men, you're supposed
to quietly leave!

57:28.699 --> 57:32.243
This is important, everyone.
Remember what I said?

57:32.244 --> 57:35.329
Nobody says anything
in our pageant

57:35.330 --> 57:37.832
except for the Angel of the Lord

57:37.833 --> 57:39.500
and of course,
the singing choir.

57:39.501 --> 57:41.210
Mary, Joseph, and the others

57:41.211 --> 57:43.921
create a lovely picture
for us to look at

57:43.922 --> 57:46.507
while we think about Christmas
and what it means.

57:46.508 --> 57:47.925
What does it mean?

57:47.926 --> 57:49.468
I'm starting to forget.

57:49.469 --> 57:51.513
Okay, let's take it from the...

57:52.556 --> 57:54.974
Imogene, you can't wear earrings
during the performance.

57:54.975 --> 57:56.726
You know Mary
didn't wear earrings.

57:56.727 --> 57:59.103
- I have to wear these.
- Why is that?

57:59.104 --> 58:01.731
I got my ears pierced and I
don't want 'em to grow together.

58:01.732 --> 58:03.107
They're not gonna grow together
in an hour and a half.

58:03.108 --> 58:04.984
Well, I'd better leave 'em in.

58:04.985 --> 58:07.153
- The doctor said that?
- What doctor?

58:07.154 --> 58:09.489
- Who pierced your ears?
- Gladys.

58:12.201 --> 58:13.243
All right.

58:14.203 --> 58:16.579
We'll find a smaller pair
for the pageant.

58:16.580 --> 58:18.539
Let's take it from the top.
Okay, so...

58:18.540 --> 58:20.541
I think I ought to tell them
what I named him.

58:20.542 --> 58:22.835
No. Remember,
Mary doesn't name the baby.

58:22.836 --> 58:24.421
I told you. I named him!

58:24.963 --> 58:27.590
No. No!
Joseph doesn't name him either.

58:27.591 --> 58:31.010
God sends an angel to tell Mary
what his name should be.

58:31.011 --> 58:32.471
I would've named him Bill.

58:33.096 --> 58:36.599
Wait, Gladys told Mary
what to name her baby?

58:36.600 --> 58:38.267
No, Gladys is the angel

58:38.268 --> 58:40.144
that comes to the shepherds
and says,

58:40.145 --> 58:41.646
"Unto you a child is born."

58:41.647 --> 58:44.732
Unto me! Not them. Me.

58:44.733 --> 58:46.734
I'm the one who had the baby.

58:46.735 --> 58:49.529
It just means
that Jesus is for the world.

58:49.530 --> 58:54.743
Unto all of us a child is born,
even the poor people, like...

58:58.330 --> 59:00.831
you know, the shepherds
you're playing.

59:00.832 --> 59:03.168
Why didn't they let Mary
name her own baby?

59:03.710 --> 59:06.087
What'd the angel do,
just walk up and say,

59:06.088 --> 59:07.673
"Name Him 'Jesus'"?

59:08.507 --> 59:10.258
- Yes.
- That's not right.

59:10.259 --> 59:11.926
The angel says,

59:11.927 --> 59:15.471
"His name shall be called
Wonderful, Counsellor...

59:15.472 --> 59:19.642
"Mighty God, Everlasting Father,
The Prince of Peace."

59:19.643 --> 59:22.061
My God! He'd never get out
of the first grade

59:22.062 --> 59:23.897
if he had to write all that.

59:26.942 --> 59:29.152
I'm so sorry.

59:29.778 --> 59:32.406
I was passing by
and thought I'd take a peek.

59:33.198 --> 59:35.617
I'd better check
on that applesauce cake.

59:40.789 --> 59:43.249
Imogene, I told you not to take
the Lord's name in vain.

59:43.250 --> 59:45.836
How can you be Mary
if you're offending everyone?

59:47.087 --> 59:48.880
I think we need to take a break.

59:48.881 --> 59:51.215
Let's meet back here
in five minutes

59:51.216 --> 59:52.551
and we'll start over.

59:54.720 --> 59:56.763
I told you
it would be a disaster.

01:00:01.894 --> 01:00:03.853
I just want you to know
I'm happy to take over

01:00:03.854 --> 01:00:05.314
the part of Mary at any time.

01:00:06.607 --> 01:00:08.192
That's good to know, Alice.

01:00:11.153 --> 01:00:12.236
Imogene, can I...

01:00:12.237 --> 01:00:13.404
I'm going to the loo,

01:00:13.405 --> 01:00:15.908
and I'm changing out
of this silly costume.

01:00:24.166 --> 01:00:26.959
There she is. Need anything?

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.838
It's kind of... all wrong.

01:00:31.048 --> 01:00:32.925
Like,
everything's falling apart.

01:00:33.717 --> 01:00:36.427
I'm not sure it was really
together in the first place.

01:00:36.428 --> 01:00:38.430
Can't we just put Alice
in as Mary?

01:00:39.056 --> 01:00:40.723
We can't let
the Herdmans ruin this

01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:42.684
for the church or embarrass you.

01:00:44.311 --> 01:00:46.938
I think Imogene's head
is doing a number on her.

01:00:46.939 --> 01:00:48.898
Just need
to get through this rehearsal.

01:00:48.899 --> 01:00:50.234
We can do this.

01:00:51.568 --> 01:00:52.860
Fire!

01:00:52.861 --> 01:00:54.446
What now?

01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:58.115
Why? Why?

01:00:58.116 --> 01:01:00.410
Thick smoke
coming from the bathroom!

01:01:02.162 --> 01:01:04.580
Okay. Okay. okay. Everyone,
grab each other's hands.

01:01:04.581 --> 01:01:06.290
Grab your neighbour's
hands and...

01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:08.292
All right, Beth,
lead the chain out.

01:01:08.293 --> 01:01:09.961
Everyone, grab your coats.

01:01:09.962 --> 01:01:12.213
Alice? Alice!

01:01:12.214 --> 01:01:13.673
Beth, honey...

01:01:13.674 --> 01:01:15.633
Everyone, come on. Come on.

01:01:15.634 --> 01:01:16.927
Are you okay, dear?

01:01:18.428 --> 01:01:20.263
I smelled smoke
when I walked in.

01:01:20.264 --> 01:01:22.057
You smelled smoke
in the bathroom?

01:01:23.851 --> 01:01:24.935
Go with your dad.

01:01:26.728 --> 01:01:29.647
- Do we know what happened?
- Herdmans happened.

01:01:29.648 --> 01:01:31.232
Come on. Come on, angels.

01:01:31.233 --> 01:01:33.068
- Imogene, are you okay?
- Yep.

01:01:34.570 --> 01:01:37.114
Step aside.
Another Herdman fire.

01:01:37.823 --> 01:01:39.907
- I'm scared.
- I know, dear. I know. I know.

01:01:39.908 --> 01:01:42.118
Herdmans? In church?

01:01:42.119 --> 01:01:44.037
Yep. All of them.

01:01:44.746 --> 01:01:46.414
Lord have mercy on us all.

01:01:46.415 --> 01:01:49.042
What a train wreck.
Nothing but trouble.

01:01:59.261 --> 01:02:01.721
Beth, I want you to go
and find the Herdmans, okay?

01:02:01.722 --> 01:02:03.848
- Okay. All right.
- Okay, go grab 'em.

01:02:03.849 --> 01:02:07.519
Imogene? Imogene?

01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:18.196
And you saw Imogene Herdman
in the bathroom?

01:02:18.197 --> 01:02:19.488
She was there.

01:02:19.489 --> 01:02:21.365
And it's well-known
those kids smoke.

01:02:21.366 --> 01:02:22.950
So that's what happened.

01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:25.244
Mum, I can't find the Herdmans.

01:02:25.245 --> 01:02:27.288
Well, they were just here,
weren't they?

01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:29.582
I looked everywhere.
They're gone.

01:02:29.583 --> 01:02:32.251
And then Dianna sees
Imogene standing there.

01:02:32.252 --> 01:02:34.004
The place is filled with smoke.

01:02:34.922 --> 01:02:38.049
Hello? She smokes.
She started the fire.

01:02:38.050 --> 01:02:39.967
This needs to be the last straw.

01:02:39.968 --> 01:02:42.554
Let's not jump
to conclusions, Rebecca.

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.556
Wouldn't that be refreshing?

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:48.059
Her Mary did this!

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:49.977
And a million
other things, Reverend.

01:02:49.978 --> 01:02:51.812
Would you like to hear?

01:02:51.813 --> 01:02:55.150
- What happens now, Mum?
- I honestly don't know.

01:02:55.901 --> 01:02:57.528
Now will they call it off?

01:02:58.987 --> 01:03:00.238
They might try.

01:03:00.239 --> 01:03:04.075
Grace said the Angel of the Lord
is like a comic book hero.

01:03:04.076 --> 01:03:06.160
Is this what I think it is?
A Herdman thing?

01:03:06.161 --> 01:03:08.120
I heard they talk about
underwear the whole time.

01:03:08.121 --> 01:03:10.081
Excuse me. The Herdman children

01:03:10.082 --> 01:03:12.166
don't talk about underwear
during rehearsals.

01:03:12.167 --> 01:03:13.251
That was another boy.

01:03:13.252 --> 01:03:16.963
Alice says they talked about
Jesus being murdered.

01:03:16.964 --> 01:03:18.673
That is in the Bible.

01:03:18.674 --> 01:03:20.550
Well, they really
shouldn't be here.

01:03:20.551 --> 01:03:21.634
- No.
- I agree.

01:03:21.635 --> 01:03:23.261
When there's smoke,
there's fire.

01:03:23.262 --> 01:03:27.224
- As in, literally.
- Okay, okay, everyone. Please.

01:03:29.768 --> 01:03:33.479
You're the one who's been doing
all the work, not them.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:36.483
If you can tell me
this will be fine, I trust you.

01:03:38.443 --> 01:03:40.571
I'm sorry,
I can't tell you that.

01:03:41.738 --> 01:03:43.990
Reverend Hopkins,
we found the source.

01:03:43.991 --> 01:03:45.200
Yes, sir?

01:03:46.952 --> 01:03:48.661
My applesauce cake!

01:03:48.662 --> 01:03:51.289
But I saw the smoke
coming from the bathroom.

01:03:51.290 --> 01:03:53.207
That's why I called.

01:03:53.208 --> 01:03:54.959
There was no fire
in the bathroom.

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.005
But while everyone was out here,
the cake burned up.

01:03:58.797 --> 01:04:01.632
Thank you, gentlemen.
Go home, everyone.

01:04:01.633 --> 01:04:03.342
We're done here. Okay?

01:04:03.343 --> 01:04:05.888
That is a wrap
on dress rehearsal.

01:04:08.473 --> 01:04:11.101
Did I say that right?
"It's a wrap"?

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:14.438
Yeah, you said it right.

01:04:17.024 --> 01:04:18.650
No one even says sorry?

01:04:21.069 --> 01:04:22.196
Let's go home.

01:04:37.211 --> 01:04:38.253
Hi, sweetheart.

01:04:39.379 --> 01:04:40.380
Hey.

01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:50.265
I think you're doing
a great job, Mum.

01:04:52.935 --> 01:04:54.019
Thanks, sweetheart.

01:04:55.354 --> 01:04:57.773
Although I don't think
anyone else agrees with you.

01:05:02.819 --> 01:05:04.112
Probably not.

01:05:07.491 --> 01:05:09.701
I just thought
I could do it somehow.

01:05:10.744 --> 01:05:12.620
And that it could be
the best one ever,

01:05:12.621 --> 01:05:14.248
even with the Herdmans.

01:05:16.124 --> 01:05:18.335
Is it still too late
to replace them?

01:05:18.961 --> 01:05:20.796
I don't think
that'd be right, honey.

01:05:22.506 --> 01:05:24.507
I also don't think it's right

01:05:24.508 --> 01:05:27.135
the way those women talk
about the Herdmans.

01:05:30.389 --> 01:05:31.807
Don't forget.

01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:36.812
The whole point of the story...

01:05:38.647 --> 01:05:41.315
is that Jesus
was born for the Herdmans

01:05:41.316 --> 01:05:43.068
as much as He was for us.

01:05:45.821 --> 01:05:47.655
We'd be missing
the point of all of it

01:05:47.656 --> 01:05:49.282
if I turned them away.

01:05:49.283 --> 01:05:50.993
But what if they ruin it
for you?

01:05:53.412 --> 01:05:54.872
They probably will.

01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:59.585
But it's not about me.

01:06:07.551 --> 01:06:10.053
You're doing a great job, Mum.

01:06:14.016 --> 01:06:16.602
Let's see what happens
tomorrow night first.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:55.057
What is it, hon?

01:07:07.736 --> 01:07:08.737
Mum?

01:07:09.446 --> 01:07:11.782
I prayed about it,
and I agree with you.

01:07:13.158 --> 01:07:15.244
You have to stick
with the Herdmans.

01:07:16.537 --> 01:07:17.746
Thanks, honey.

01:07:19.289 --> 01:07:21.874
But I can't get a call through
to the Herdman house.

01:07:21.875 --> 01:07:23.544
Is it disconnected?

01:07:24.294 --> 01:07:25.629
I don't think so.

01:07:26.296 --> 01:07:29.173
I hope they didn't hear what
people were saying about them.

01:07:29.174 --> 01:07:32.094
Wait. Did Imogene quit?

01:07:33.262 --> 01:07:35.222
- I don't know.
- How could she quit?

01:07:35.848 --> 01:07:38.432
- She can't do that to you!
- It'll be all right, Beth.

01:07:38.433 --> 01:07:41.353
Alice knows how to play Mary.
It'll be fine.

01:07:41.979 --> 01:07:45.398
Or, well, you know,
it'll be what it's always been.

01:07:45.399 --> 01:07:47.150
It can't be
what it's always been!

01:07:49.695 --> 01:07:51.113
Beth, where are you going?

01:07:52.406 --> 01:07:53.406
Beth?

01:07:53.407 --> 01:07:55.783
<i>Explain this one to me.</i>

01:07:55.784 --> 01:07:58.077
<i>Before, the only way
for the pageant to work</i>

01:07:58.078 --> 01:07:59.662
<i>was without the Herdmans.</i>

01:07:59.663 --> 01:08:02.373
<i>Now, the only way for it to work
was with them.</i>

01:08:02.374 --> 01:08:05.209
<i>Maybe my mum didn't lead
committees or run a business</i>

01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:07.420
<i>or wear a power dress
while shopping</i>

01:08:07.421 --> 01:08:10.590
<i>but she did the right thing
when no one else would.</i>

01:08:10.591 --> 01:08:12.758
<i>So now, I had to.</i>

01:08:12.759 --> 01:08:17.055
<i>And that meant facing
Imogene Herdman alone.</i>

01:08:40.912 --> 01:08:41.955
Hi, Gladys.

01:08:44.541 --> 01:08:46.376
I need to talk to Imogene.

01:08:50.589 --> 01:08:53.091
Okay, then.

01:08:57.386 --> 01:08:58.638
What do you want?

01:08:58.639 --> 01:08:59.972
<i>After all that riding,</i>

01:08:59.973 --> 01:09:01.933
<i>you'd think I'd have
figured out what to say.</i>

01:09:01.934 --> 01:09:04.143
<i>There were a million things
running through my head.</i>

01:09:04.144 --> 01:09:07.103
<i>But when she opened the door,
all I could get out was...</i>

01:09:07.104 --> 01:09:08.357
Hey.

01:09:09.858 --> 01:09:10.859
Wait!

01:09:12.944 --> 01:09:15.862
- Why'd you leave last night?
- It was cold out.

01:09:15.863 --> 01:09:18.115
They were trying to figure out
what happened.

01:09:18.116 --> 01:09:21.077
Bunch of idiots standin' around,
scratchin' their bums.

01:09:21.078 --> 01:09:23.579
They figured out we did it,
then started lookin'.

01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:24.871
No, no, they burned a cake.

01:09:24.872 --> 01:09:27.250
Doesn't matter what happened.
They knew it was me.

01:09:27.251 --> 01:09:29.836
They think you smoke cigars.
They just assumed...

01:09:29.837 --> 01:09:31.295
Of course they did.

01:09:31.296 --> 01:09:34.840
Well, were you smoking a cigar?

01:09:34.841 --> 01:09:36.092
Yes.

01:09:36.093 --> 01:09:37.636
Oh.

01:09:40.055 --> 01:09:41.597
Well, you shouldn't smoke.

01:09:41.598 --> 01:09:43.809
- Got it. Bye.
- Wait!

01:09:45.018 --> 01:09:47.269
- Are you gonna do the pageant?
- Nope.

01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:48.855
- What?
- I'm not doin' it.

01:09:48.856 --> 01:09:51.190
But I thought you wanted
to be someone else.

01:09:51.191 --> 01:09:52.525
Like in a film.

01:09:52.526 --> 01:09:54.778
Things changed. Bye.

01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:00.283
- Do you mind?
- Yes. I mind. I mind a lot!

01:10:00.284 --> 01:10:04.662
My mother stood up for you.
She fought for you.

01:10:04.663 --> 01:10:07.707
The town practically
hates her for it.

01:10:07.708 --> 01:10:11.586
But she did it anyway.
Because she cares about you.

01:10:11.587 --> 01:10:12.670
What do you care?

01:10:12.671 --> 01:10:15.465
You didn't want me
in the pageant anyway.

01:10:16.008 --> 01:10:17.009
Right?

01:10:17.885 --> 01:10:20.095
- Things changed.
- Really?

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.932
My mum needs you to be Mary.

01:10:25.851 --> 01:10:26.852
Okay?

01:10:27.477 --> 01:10:29.813
Yes, I told her
not to let you do it.

01:10:31.607 --> 01:10:33.150
She gave you a chance.

01:10:34.193 --> 01:10:35.985
People are coming from all over

01:10:35.986 --> 01:10:37.904
and it's too late
to change all the parts

01:10:37.905 --> 01:10:40.489
and hope it's just the same old,
boring pageant...

01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:41.574
I can't do it!

01:10:41.575 --> 01:10:43.492
I'll never be the girl
in the painting.

01:10:43.493 --> 01:10:45.661
But we can't have
a painting on stage.

01:10:45.662 --> 01:10:46.996
We need a real person.

01:10:46.997 --> 01:10:50.958
- Alice will do it.
- Right. "Alice'll do it."

01:10:50.959 --> 01:10:53.002
Everyone loves Mary

01:10:53.003 --> 01:10:55.838
because she's sweet
and she's pretty.

01:10:55.839 --> 01:10:57.299
And I'll never be...

01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:04.973
You don't think you can be sweet
because you're so tough.

01:11:05.766 --> 01:11:07.684
Toughest kid
in the world, right?

01:11:09.228 --> 01:11:13.065
But if you quit the pageant,
you won't be sweet or tough.

01:11:13.941 --> 01:11:16.275
Besides, Mary,

01:11:16.276 --> 01:11:18.195
the real Mary,

01:11:18.904 --> 01:11:21.155
didn't care
what anyone thought of her

01:11:21.156 --> 01:11:24.076
and did the hard thing,
even though it was scary.

01:11:27.704 --> 01:11:29.498
You're kinda
like that, actually.

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.461
Please show up.

01:11:36.421 --> 01:11:37.589
For my mum?

01:11:40.676 --> 01:11:43.011
Even if it's just to make
everyone angry?

01:11:45.138 --> 01:11:49.059
I'm sorry. I'm a Herdman.
I'm just not her.

01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:04.491
At least our candles
will look perfect.

01:12:06.451 --> 01:12:07.870
Well...

01:12:08.912 --> 01:12:09.913
we're here.

01:12:12.124 --> 01:12:14.585
You made it. Be proud of that.

01:12:15.502 --> 01:12:16.503
Right, Beth?

01:12:17.921 --> 01:12:20.299
We've never once
run through the whole thing.

01:12:20.883 --> 01:12:22.884
I don't know
what's gonna happen tonight.

01:12:22.885 --> 01:12:24.135
If the Herdmans show up,

01:12:24.136 --> 01:12:26.137
it might be the first
Christmas pageant in history

01:12:26.138 --> 01:12:28.347
where Joseph and the Wise Men
get in a fight

01:12:28.348 --> 01:12:31.143
and Mary lights a cigar
and hightails it with the baby.

01:12:31.727 --> 01:12:33.687
- Do you mind?
- No.

01:12:36.231 --> 01:12:38.066
- Break a leg.
- Thank you.

01:12:38.817 --> 01:12:40.026
He doesn't mean it.

01:12:40.027 --> 01:12:41.694
It's what they say
in the theatre.

01:12:41.695 --> 01:12:44.198
Mrs Armstrong wrote about it
in her book of notes.

01:12:45.073 --> 01:12:46.949
Hey, look at you.

01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:48.243
Too tight.

01:12:50.037 --> 01:12:52.164
You look great.
You can go backstage.

01:12:56.001 --> 01:12:57.711
Don't think they're coming.

01:13:06.887 --> 01:13:08.096
I think I need Alice.

01:13:11.892 --> 01:13:13.060
Understood.

01:13:14.144 --> 01:13:15.145
Alice?

01:13:18.941 --> 01:13:21.068
You may need to play
Mary tonight.

01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:46.425
- All right, here we go.
- Yeah.

01:13:46.426 --> 01:13:48.302
Shirley's wing poked me.

01:13:48.303 --> 01:13:50.763
It's okay, sweetheart. When
she turns around, just duck.

01:13:50.764 --> 01:13:51.932
Okay.

01:13:58.438 --> 01:14:00.941
Mary and Joseph
are dressed and ready to go.

01:14:02.442 --> 01:14:03.652
That's great, Alice.

01:14:34.933 --> 01:14:36.852
<i>Thank you all for coming.</i>

01:14:42.274 --> 01:14:44.026
<i>For 75 years,</i>

01:14:44.818 --> 01:14:48.822
<i>the pageant
has been an opportunity</i>

01:14:50.782 --> 01:14:54.369
<i>to remind us who Christmas
is supposed to be about.</i>

01:14:56.705 --> 01:14:57.748
<i>This year,</i>

01:14:59.541 --> 01:15:02.336
<i>it's turned out a little
different than we planned.</i>

01:15:02.961 --> 01:15:06.548
<i>Which, I'll admit,
is a first for this pageant.</i>

01:15:12.638 --> 01:15:13.680
<i>Honestly...</i>

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:20.646
<i>...so much has happened
to get us here...</i>

01:15:22.856 --> 01:15:25.859
<i>...that I don't quite know
what's gonna happen tonight.</i>

01:15:28.779 --> 01:15:30.739
<i>But maybe
that's not a bad thing.</i>

01:15:32.157 --> 01:15:35.077
<i>Because Mary and Joseph
weren't so sure either.</i>

01:15:39.164 --> 01:15:40.541
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

01:15:42.793 --> 01:15:44.086
<i>And Merry Christmas.</i>

01:15:59.810 --> 01:16:02.479
- Are you okay?
- I have no idea.

01:16:03.730 --> 01:16:04.773
Okay.

01:16:24.209 --> 01:16:27.795
<i>Away in a manger</i>

01:16:27.796 --> 01:16:31.591
<i>No crib for a bed</i>

01:16:31.592 --> 01:16:35.469
<i>The little Lord Jesus</i>

01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:38.806
<i>Laid down His sweet head</i>

01:16:38.807 --> 01:16:40.850
<i>The stars in the bright sky...</i>

01:16:40.851 --> 01:16:42.186
What is she doing?

01:16:42.728 --> 01:16:44.228
<i>Looked down where He lay...</i>

01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:46.105
What's wrong?

01:16:46.106 --> 01:16:49.775
<i>The little Lord Jesus</i>

01:16:49.776 --> 01:16:53.696
<i>Asleep on the hay</i>

01:16:53.697 --> 01:16:57.825
<i>The cattle are lowing</i>

01:16:57.826 --> 01:17:01.162
<i>The Baby awakes</i>

01:17:01.163 --> 01:17:04.875
<i>But little Lord Jesus...</i>

01:17:15.677 --> 01:17:16.845
What is she wearing?

01:17:17.554 --> 01:17:19.096
She brought something from home.

01:17:19.097 --> 01:17:21.098
She said
if she was going to do this,

01:17:21.099 --> 01:17:23.434
she was gonna look
like the real Mary.

01:17:23.435 --> 01:17:25.312
They look like refugees.

01:17:27.523 --> 01:17:28.565
Yeah.

01:17:30.108 --> 01:17:31.276
They do.

01:17:34.571 --> 01:17:37.156
<i>"In the days of Caesar Augustus,</i>

01:17:37.157 --> 01:17:38.783
<i>"a decree went out</i>

01:17:38.784 --> 01:17:41.202
<i>"that all the world
should be taxed</i>

01:17:41.203 --> 01:17:44.623
<i>"and Joseph went to Bethlehem
with Mary, his wife..."</i>

01:17:53.131 --> 01:17:58.135
<i>O little town of Bethlehem</i>

01:17:58.136 --> 01:18:02.974
<i>How still we see thee lie</i>

01:18:02.975 --> 01:18:07.895
<i>Above thy deep
and dreamless sleep</i>

01:18:07.896 --> 01:18:12.692
<i>The silent stars go by</i>

01:18:12.693 --> 01:18:17.154
<i>Yet in thy dark streets shineth</i>

01:18:17.155 --> 01:18:21.409
<i>The everlasting light...</i>

01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:23.035
Why are you burpin' the doll?

01:18:23.036 --> 01:18:25.747
It's how I helped Gladys
when she was a baby.

01:18:27.583 --> 01:18:30.126
<i>Are met in thee tonight...</i>

01:18:30.127 --> 01:18:32.086
I never!

01:18:32.087 --> 01:18:34.797
Burping the Baby Jesus
as if He had colic.

01:18:34.798 --> 01:18:36.883
That certainly
wasn't in the programme.

01:18:36.884 --> 01:18:38.301
Well, I like it.

01:18:38.302 --> 01:18:40.720
You think the Baby Jesus
didn't need to burp?

01:18:40.721 --> 01:18:41.805
He's...

01:18:42.764 --> 01:18:43.764
<i>"And in that region,</i>

01:18:43.765 --> 01:18:45.683
<i>"there were shepherds
in the field,</i>

01:18:45.684 --> 01:18:48.604
<i>"keeping watch
over their flocks by night."</i>

01:18:53.442 --> 01:18:58.279
<i>While shepherds watched
their flocks by night</i>

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:03.242
<i>All seated on the ground</i>

01:19:03.243 --> 01:19:08.372
<i>The Angel of the Lord came down</i>

01:19:08.373 --> 01:19:13.545
<i>And glory shone around</i>

01:19:14.922 --> 01:19:18.383
<i>"And an Angel of the Lord
appeared to them."</i>

01:19:27.518 --> 01:19:30.687
<i>And an Angel of the Lord
appeared to them.</i>

01:19:38.654 --> 01:19:39.738
Hey!

01:19:42.533 --> 01:19:45.410
Unto you a child is born!

01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:52.417
What are you waiting for?
Go see the baby!

01:20:13.021 --> 01:20:14.189
Hurry up!

01:20:36.378 --> 01:20:40.840
<i>We three kings of orient are</i>

01:20:40.841 --> 01:20:44.595
<i>Bearing gifts we traverse afar</i>

01:20:45.345 --> 01:20:47.763
<i>Field and fountain</i>

01:20:47.764 --> 01:20:49.515
<i>Moor and mountain...</i>

01:20:49.516 --> 01:20:51.434
I knew this would happen.

01:20:51.435 --> 01:20:54.605
They don't have the frankincense
or the myrrh or the gold.

01:20:55.105 --> 01:20:56.731
<i>They brought something different</i>

01:20:56.732 --> 01:20:58.942
<i>and I knew right away
where it came from.</i>

01:21:00.027 --> 01:21:01.987
They probably
don't even like ham.

01:21:02.779 --> 01:21:05.741
Yes, they do. They love ham.

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:11.163
My ham's in the play.

01:21:14.625 --> 01:21:15.958
<i>"And when Jesus was born,</i>

01:21:15.959 --> 01:21:19.712
<i>"there came Wise Men
from the east to worship Him,</i>

01:21:19.713 --> 01:21:23.926
<i>"bringing gifts of gold
and frankincense and myrrh."</i>

01:21:33.810 --> 01:21:36.896
They're supposed to leave.
They're ruining the whole thing.

01:21:36.897 --> 01:21:38.105
It makes perfect sense

01:21:38.106 --> 01:21:40.316
for the Wise Men
to sit down and rest.

01:21:40.317 --> 01:21:42.109
They came a long way.

01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:44.570
You expect them
to hand over the ham and leave?

01:21:44.571 --> 01:21:46.406
They didn't bring ham!

01:21:51.453 --> 01:21:56.624
<i>What Child is this who
laid to rest</i>

01:21:56.625 --> 01:22:01.462
<i>On Mary's lap, is sleeping?</i>

01:22:01.463 --> 01:22:03.589
<i>Whom angels...</i>

01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:06.300
<i>As for ruining the whole thing,</i>

01:22:06.301 --> 01:22:07.385
<i>it seemed to me</i>

01:22:07.386 --> 01:22:10.848
<i>that the Herdmans had improved
the pageant, a lot.</i>

01:22:12.474 --> 01:22:14.809
<i>Just by doing
what came naturally.</i>

01:22:14.810 --> 01:22:17.395
<i>Like burping the baby,
for instance.</i>

01:22:17.396 --> 01:22:19.856
<i>Or thinking a ham
would make a better present</i>

01:22:19.857 --> 01:22:21.900
<i>than a lot of perfume or oil.</i>

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.746
<i>Usually by the time
we got to</i> Silent Night,

01:22:35.747 --> 01:22:37.707
<i>I was fed up
with the whole thing,</i>

01:22:37.708 --> 01:22:39.710
<i>couldn't wait for it to be over.</i>

01:22:40.752 --> 01:22:43.088
<i>But I didn't feel
that way this time.</i>

01:22:46.466 --> 01:22:49.552
<i>I almost wished
for the pageant to go on</i>

01:22:49.553 --> 01:22:51.053
<i>with the Herdmans in charge,</i>

01:22:51.054 --> 01:22:53.307
<i>just to see what else they'd do.</i>

01:23:32.221 --> 01:23:36.350
<i>I realised I'd never really
seen the Nativity before.</i>

01:23:37.518 --> 01:23:41.605
<i>But Imogene was helping me
see it more clearly than ever.</i>

01:23:53.742 --> 01:23:57.286
<i>Silent night</i>

01:23:57.287 --> 01:24:00.456
<i>Holy night</i>

01:24:00.457 --> 01:24:04.210
<i>All is calm</i>

01:24:04.211 --> 01:24:07.422
<i>All is bright</i>

01:24:08.048 --> 01:24:12.844
<i>Round yon Virgin
Mother and Child...</i>

01:24:12.845 --> 01:24:14.680
<i>And then it happened.</i>

01:24:15.639 --> 01:24:17.765
<i>Everyone had been waiting
all this time</i>

01:24:17.766 --> 01:24:21.435
<i>for the Herdmans to do something
absolutely unexpected.</i>

01:24:21.436 --> 01:24:23.187
<i>And sure enough...</i>

01:24:23.188 --> 01:24:24.273
Look.

01:24:29.361 --> 01:24:30.487
She's crying.

01:24:32.155 --> 01:24:33.574
Mary is crying.

01:24:39.997 --> 01:24:41.539
<i>In that moment...</i>

01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:45.168
<i>Imogene Herdman experienced
the real Christmas story</i>

01:24:45.169 --> 01:24:46.712
<i>for the very first time.</i>

01:24:50.841 --> 01:24:52.885
<i>And so we did, too.</i>

01:26:00.786 --> 01:26:03.956
<i>Lord at thy birth</i>

01:26:08.961 --> 01:26:09.962
<i>Well...</i>

01:26:10.671 --> 01:26:13.841
<i>it was the best
Christmas pageant ever.</i>

01:26:38.115 --> 01:26:39.116
Take a bow.

01:26:41.326 --> 01:26:44.288
Bow. They're clapping for you.

01:27:11.732 --> 01:27:12.941
Thank you.

01:27:47.976 --> 01:27:50.478
<i>Everyone agreed
it was the best ever,</i>

01:27:50.479 --> 01:27:53.190
<i>but nobody seemed to know
why exactly.</i>

01:27:53.815 --> 01:27:55.525
<i>One thing I did know,</i>

01:27:55.526 --> 01:27:56.692
<i>because of my mum</i>

01:27:56.693 --> 01:27:58.986
<i>and her understanding
of the Christmas story,</i>

01:27:58.987 --> 01:28:02.407
<i>the Herdmans finally got
what they needed most all along.</i>

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.409
<i>A community.</i>

01:28:05.035 --> 01:28:07.829
<i>But they gave us something
we needed all along, too.</i>

01:28:08.622 --> 01:28:10.957
<i>For years, I thought about
the wonder of Christmas</i>

01:28:10.958 --> 01:28:14.210
<i>and the mystery of Jesus's birth
and never really understood it.</i>

01:28:14.211 --> 01:28:18.298
<i>But now, it didn't seem
so mysterious after all.</i>

01:28:19.341 --> 01:28:22.009
<i>When Imogene asked me
what the pageant was about,</i>

01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:24.178
<i>I told her it was about Jesus.</i>

01:28:24.179 --> 01:28:26.473
<i>But that was just part of it.</i>

01:28:27.516 --> 01:28:29.100
<i>It was about a new baby</i>

01:28:29.101 --> 01:28:31.310
<i>and His dirt-poor
mother and father</i>

01:28:31.311 --> 01:28:33.145
<i>who were in a lot of trouble.</i>

01:28:33.146 --> 01:28:36.232
<i>No money, no place to go,
no doctor,</i>

01:28:36.233 --> 01:28:38.402
<i>nobody they knew, no respect.</i>

01:28:39.236 --> 01:28:43.407
<i>But they were the ones God chose
to help change the world.</i>

01:28:48.203 --> 01:28:49.538
<i>As for Imogene,</i>

01:28:50.414 --> 01:28:53.625
<i>Christmas seemed
to come over her all at once.</i>

01:29:21.486 --> 01:29:22.738
Thanks for coming back.

01:29:23.655 --> 01:29:24.656
You made me.

01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:28.035
I don't think so.

01:29:30.621 --> 01:29:33.332
Here's your ham. Great prop.

01:29:34.208 --> 01:29:37.544
It wasn't a prop.
It was a gift from the boys.

01:29:42.049 --> 01:29:43.133
And...

01:29:44.092 --> 01:29:45.427
I have something else.

01:29:47.387 --> 01:29:49.389
I figured it was time
to return this.

01:29:58.941 --> 01:30:00.192
Thanks.

01:30:01.610 --> 01:30:05.030
So, now that
the pageant is over,

01:30:06.490 --> 01:30:08.909
you probably don't plan
on coming here again.

01:30:10.202 --> 01:30:12.663
But maybe you could come
next week?

01:30:15.582 --> 01:30:17.167
As long as there's snacks.

01:30:23.549 --> 01:30:25.050
It's exactly right.

01:30:26.093 --> 01:30:27.177
Right?

01:30:28.011 --> 01:30:29.096
What's that?

01:30:30.055 --> 01:30:31.098
The painting.

01:30:32.891 --> 01:30:35.102
<i>What did she mean
"exactly right"?</i>

01:30:35.936 --> 01:30:37.104
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:30:40.732 --> 01:30:46.446
I think Imogene liked the idea
of the Mary in the painting.

01:30:48.323 --> 01:30:49.825
All pure-looking.

01:30:50.659 --> 01:30:52.578
As if she never
did anything else

01:30:53.412 --> 01:30:55.914
except have Jesus
on Christmas Eve.

01:30:58.542 --> 01:31:00.252
Imogene once told me,

01:31:01.253 --> 01:31:03.005
"I'm not her."

01:31:05.507 --> 01:31:06.633
But to me...

01:31:08.635 --> 01:31:11.638
Mary will always
look like Imogene Herdman.

01:31:15.017 --> 01:31:16.226
That's why...

01:31:17.644 --> 01:31:21.106
we still use this blanket
even after all these years.

01:31:27.779 --> 01:31:29.907
So, everyone,

01:31:30.824 --> 01:31:31.991
now that you know

01:31:31.992 --> 01:31:35.204
why the pageant
is so important to us...

01:31:36.330 --> 01:31:40.042
I don't know, would anybody
like to play a part?

01:31:41.502 --> 01:31:44.086
Wow, that is so many hands!

01:31:44.087 --> 01:31:45.213
Thankfully,

01:31:45.214 --> 01:31:49.635
we have a lot of parts
and there are no small parts.

01:31:50.761 --> 01:31:53.471
Okay, so, parents, if you wanna,

01:31:53.472 --> 01:31:56.015
take everybody down
to the sanctuary,

01:31:56.016 --> 01:31:57.558
we'll get everybody sorted.

01:31:57.559 --> 01:31:58.935
We'll assign you roles

01:31:58.936 --> 01:32:01.980
and we will have
our very first rehearsal.

01:32:02.523 --> 01:32:03.857
Okay, get out of here.

01:32:49.945 --> 01:32:51.738
Can I try those?

01:32:59.538 --> 01:33:02.124
Well, those were Gladys' wings.

01:33:02.708 --> 01:33:04.876
She won't let anyone else
wear them.

01:33:04.877 --> 01:33:10.257
But if you run on downstairs,
we'll find you a whole new set.

01:33:27.357 --> 01:33:30.777
"Hey. Unto you a child is born."
