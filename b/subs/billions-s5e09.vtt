[Wendy]

00:04.254 --> 00:06.005
<i>Previously on</i> Billions.

00:06.047 --> 00:08.133
Are you here to tell me

00:06.047 --> 00:08.133
that you found me a donor?

00:08.175 --> 00:10.260
[Wendy]<i> He's gonna die</i>

00:08.175 --> 00:10.260
<i>unless he gets a kidney.</i>

00:10.302 --> 00:11.637
-So I thought I--

00:10.302 --> 00:11.637
-[Axe] You should've come to me.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.180
[Taylor]<i> If you work with me,</i>

00:13.221 --> 00:14.765
I need your blood

00:13.221 --> 00:14.765
because that is what I give.

00:14.807 --> 00:16.642
You want to own me.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.393
And that's not cool.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.688
[Axe]<i> The mythical</i>

00:18.435 --> 00:20.688
<i>incorruptible artist,</i>

00:20.729 --> 00:22.773
impervious to temptation.

00:22.815 --> 00:25.651
[Wendy]<i> When we met, you acted</i>

00:22.815 --> 00:25.651
<i>like money is like chains.</i>

00:25.693 --> 00:28.195
It's just that now that

00:25.693 --> 00:28.195
I have a little bit of it...

00:28.236 --> 00:29.864
it's startin'

00:28.236 --> 00:29.864
to feel like freedom.

00:29.905 --> 00:32.115
My favorite artist

00:29.905 --> 00:32.115
isn't getting paid enough.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.200
What do you got in mind?

00:33.241 --> 00:34.242
The freezer section.

00:34.284 --> 00:35.828
Michael Prince is ready

00:35.870 --> 00:37.454
<i>to be confirmed</i>

00:35.870 --> 00:37.454
<i>Ambassador Extraordinary</i>

00:37.496 --> 00:39.456
<i>and Plenipotentiary to Denmark.</i>

00:39.498 --> 00:41.542
You're in a battle

00:39.498 --> 00:41.542
with Bobby Axelrod.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.544
<i>Help me to help you beat him.</i>

00:43.585 --> 00:45.420
You can look as long and hard

00:43.585 --> 00:45.420
as you want at my life,

00:45.462 --> 00:46.714
<i>past or present.</i>

00:46.755 --> 00:48.298
He's got a secret.

00:48.340 --> 00:49.967
Fucking find it.

00:50.009 --> 00:52.051
<i>It's been brutal, really,</i>

00:52.093 --> 00:54.930
<i>to watch the world</i>

00:52.093 --> 00:54.930
<i>celebrate this man</i>

00:54.972 --> 00:57.850
<i>and know the truth about</i>

00:54.972 --> 00:57.850
<i>what he did to my son.</i>

00:57.892 --> 00:59.351
Found some neighborhood

00:57.892 --> 00:59.351
folks that got fleeced

00:59.393 --> 01:00.435
by a payday lender.

01:00.477 --> 01:02.312
<i>Company's called Plaintif-Full.</i>

01:02.354 --> 01:03.731
[Chuck]<i> I am in the mood</i>

01:02.354 --> 01:03.731
<i>to take someone down.</i>

01:03.772 --> 01:04.982
[Victor]<i> He went for the lure.</i>

01:05.024 --> 01:05.900
And he got hooked.

01:05.941 --> 01:07.359
Fuck yeah!

01:07.401 --> 01:08.736
Why would Axe care

01:07.401 --> 01:08.736
about buying up

01:08.777 --> 01:10.571
a marginal shitbag operation?

01:10.612 --> 01:12.155
The way they got away

01:10.612 --> 01:12.155
with a bunch of their

01:12.197 --> 01:13.741
unethical lending

01:12.197 --> 01:13.741
is doing it in-house.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.075
They have a bank charter.

01:15.116 --> 01:17.202
We just delivered Axe his bank.

01:37.848 --> 01:39.098
[Chuck] This one?

01:39.140 --> 01:40.559
Keep scrolling.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.686
We can do this

01:41.351 --> 01:42.686
a month from now.

01:42.728 --> 01:44.897
No, no.

01:42.728 --> 01:44.897
Time is stalking me down.

01:44.939 --> 01:46.565
-It's inexorable.

01:44.939 --> 01:46.565
-No, Dad.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.609
None of that.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.609
You're gonna outlast--

01:48.650 --> 01:51.570
Now listen, you keep your

01:48.650 --> 01:51.570
goddamn emotional lid on

01:51.612 --> 01:53.030
during the service.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.908
I'm everything to you,

01:54.448 --> 01:55.908
your whole world.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.451
I know this.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.453
And I gotta make

01:57.492 --> 01:59.453
this clear to you now,

01:59.494 --> 02:02.039
or you'll get

01:59.494 --> 02:02.039
the waterworks going

02:02.081 --> 02:03.665
like Iguazu Falls.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.960
No, sir. No,

02:03.707 --> 02:05.960
I will comport myself

02:06.001 --> 02:07.335
as you have taught me...

02:07.377 --> 02:09.254
with dry eyes

02:09.296 --> 02:11.882
and an ass clenched tighter than

02:11.924 --> 02:14.134
Steve Reeves

02:11.924 --> 02:14.134
on a busman's holiday.

02:14.175 --> 02:15.218
Oh! [chuckles]

02:15.260 --> 02:17.220
That's something.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.765
Are you burying me,

02:17.262 --> 02:19.765
or parading me through

02:19.807 --> 02:21.349
the streets with

02:19.807 --> 02:21.349
the Hibernians?

02:21.391 --> 02:23.644
You may be

02:21.391 --> 02:23.644
demonstrating a failure

02:23.685 --> 02:25.813
to show appreciation of what

02:23.685 --> 02:25.813
I'm goin' through here.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.272
I have lie in it.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.774
I think that's

02:27.314 --> 02:28.774
appreciation enough.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.484
Pesci?<i> The Irishman</i> ?

02:30.525 --> 02:32.360
No? I was just

02:30.525 --> 02:32.360
looking for a moment

02:32.402 --> 02:33.528
of levity in the darkness.

02:33.570 --> 02:34.696
Now, I don't need that

02:34.738 --> 02:36.115
or Martin fucking Scorsese

02:36.156 --> 02:37.741
to explain the process of aging

02:37.783 --> 02:39.409
and physical destruction to me.

02:39.451 --> 02:42.162
Especially not

02:39.451 --> 02:42.162
at four hours running time...

02:43.038 --> 02:44.581
when lack of time

02:44.623 --> 02:46.416
is the immediate

02:44.623 --> 02:46.416
problem I'm facing.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.043
You have got things

02:46.458 --> 02:48.043
in your life

02:48.085 --> 02:49.711
worth stayin' around for, Dad.

02:49.753 --> 02:52.171
Roxanne, the baby, my kids.

02:52.213 --> 02:53.548
Me.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.050
Let's quit

02:53.590 --> 02:55.050
the optimistic bullshit.

02:55.092 --> 02:58.470
I've got a couple of

02:55.092 --> 02:58.470
rock-hard peach pits

02:58.512 --> 02:59.888
for kidneys.

03:00.973 --> 03:02.390
We're buyin' a casket here.

03:02.432 --> 03:03.851
[sighs] I am.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.310
As in I'm paying.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.312
Wouldn't give you

03:05.352 --> 03:07.312
the satisfaction.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.149
Well, my credit card's already

03:07.354 --> 03:10.149
on file at Frank E. Campbell.

03:10.189 --> 03:11.984
And I told them

03:10.189 --> 03:11.984
I'd be the one around

03:12.026 --> 03:14.277
to bother them if they

03:12.026 --> 03:14.277
fucked with me on this.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.782
I guess it is

03:16.947 --> 03:18.782
what it is, huh?

03:21.827 --> 03:22.995
Yeah.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.962
What you have in front of you...

03:32.004 --> 03:34.756
is a perfect

03:32.004 --> 03:34.756
expression of pizza.

03:40.428 --> 03:41.513
[sniffs]

03:47.686 --> 03:51.148
Ingredients locally sourced

03:47.686 --> 03:51.148

03:51.190 --> 03:52.649
When it comes out of the oven,

03:52.691 --> 03:54.151
it's as good as anything

03:52.691 --> 03:54.151
at the restaurant.

03:54.193 --> 03:55.360
So you say.

03:55.402 --> 03:56.695
I'll be the judge, yeah?

04:00.490 --> 04:02.034
[chews]

04:10.792 --> 04:13.336
[laughs]

04:13.378 --> 04:15.463
<i>Holy shit. Kid,</i>

04:15.505 --> 04:16.798
<i>you did it.</i>

04:16.840 --> 04:18.008
He did it.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.218
I just wrote the checks.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.510
[chuckles]

04:20.552 --> 04:22.345
[unintelligible muttering]

04:22.387 --> 04:24.223
You had me worried. We got

04:22.387 --> 04:24.223
a 100,000 of these things

04:24.264 --> 04:26.266
on a container ship

04:24.264 --> 04:26.266
headed for our shores.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.936
Congratulations.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.729
-Is Bobby taking care of you?

04:28.977 --> 04:30.729
-Yeah.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.023
Of course I am. We got

04:30.771 --> 04:33.023
private equity circling already.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.900
<i>And once we choose</i>

04:33.065 --> 04:34.900

04:34.942 --> 04:36.317
<i>fine gentlemen to the prom,</i>

04:37.861 --> 04:38.904
Yes, he will.

find anyone better,

more committed.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.183
But you're not fighting back.

05:08.225 --> 05:09.143
I'm in the wrong.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.269
Who cares?

05:10.310 --> 05:11.603
It's time to rise up and--

05:14.189 --> 05:15.356
My hawk-like instincts

05:14.189 --> 05:15.356
are telling me

05:15.398 --> 05:16.650
to leave it there for now.

Distance yourself.

05:37.545 --> 05:39.756
You and I can do more good

05:37.545 --> 05:39.756
by letting The Mike fold

05:39.798 --> 05:42.050
and then raising something new

05:39.798 --> 05:42.050
from the ashes.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.844
We're good at that.

05:45.553 --> 05:46.930
Yeah, Shawn. You too.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.308
Get me to see Taleb.

Gotta make sure this thing's

No money to be made.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.445
like you talk to me?

06:02.487 --> 06:03.780
I'm gonna talk to you

06:02.487 --> 06:03.780
like you talk to me.

06:03.822 --> 06:05.199
This is to what?

06:03.822 --> 06:05.199
Refocus my lens?

06:05.240 --> 06:06.700
That it is.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.160
We got a bank charter

06:06.741 --> 06:08.160
24 hours ago,

06:08.202 --> 06:09.619
and instead of setting up

06:08.202 --> 06:09.619
a boardroom

06:09.661 --> 06:10.787
and printing stationery,

06:09.661 --> 06:10.787
I'm searching

06:10.829 --> 06:12.371
"hashtag The Mike."

06:12.413 --> 06:13.665
You've been giving away

06:12.413 --> 06:13.665
majority ownership

06:13.707 --> 06:15.458
in this pizza company.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.585
What I'm really searching

06:15.500 --> 06:17.585
for is a pattern in the madness.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.504
But all I'm seein'

06:17.627 --> 06:19.504
is the madness.

06:19.546 --> 06:22.090
Hmm. The reason

06:19.546 --> 06:22.090
I can talk like that--

06:22.132 --> 06:23.675
Well, there are myriad reasons,

06:23.717 --> 06:25.384
none of which you'd understand.

06:25.426 --> 06:26.970
As you don't understand

06:25.426 --> 06:26.970
why my moves right now

06:27.012 --> 06:28.596
are the very acme of sanity.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.389
Thank you for

06:28.638 --> 06:30.389
your thoughts and prayers.

06:30.431 --> 06:31.599
Now do my bidding.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.227
And get me Taleb. Let's go.

06:42.443 --> 06:44.029
[Prince] No, no,

06:42.443 --> 06:44.029
I-- I understand.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.322
But I still think

06:44.071 --> 06:45.322
I'm the best choice

06:45.364 --> 06:46.823
to lead "Shake the Quake."

06:49.534 --> 06:50.911
Of course. Uh....

06:51.870 --> 06:54.081
Well, let's find you

06:51.870 --> 06:54.081
a new public face.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.707
I'd be happy to make some calls.

06:56.415 --> 06:57.458
Goodbye.

Where are we on The Mike?

07:11.639 --> 07:14.226

07:14.268 --> 07:15.143
Cancel it.

07:16.228 --> 07:17.812
It's your legacy.

07:17.854 --> 07:18.897
The Mike is bigger--

07:18.939 --> 07:21.233
Cancel... the darned...

07:21.275 --> 07:22.150
event.

07:25.904 --> 07:26.905
[tosses phone]

07:31.118 --> 07:32.577
The Mike is toast.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.122
Charities are abandoning him.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.083
Let's ratchet up

07:36.456 --> 07:38.083
to personal life.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.876
I have to go with

07:38.125 --> 07:39.876
this one more time.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.337
I am here for

07:40.710 --> 07:42.337
whatever you need.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.131
[scoffs] And I'm always up

07:44.172 --> 07:45.590
for a bloody vanquishing.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.592
But Prince is done.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.592
He's bled out.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.844
And you're calling in

07:47.634 --> 07:49.844
favors for what?

07:49.886 --> 07:52.055
So you can fuck

07:49.886 --> 07:52.055
a dead guy's skull?

07:52.097 --> 07:53.932
Michael Douglas only

07:52.097 --> 07:53.932
talked about it in<i> The Bible.</i>

07:53.974 --> 07:55.600
He didn't do it.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.061
Besides, skullfuckery

07:55.642 --> 07:58.061
is not even fun to watch.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.106
Okay. That part is a lie.

08:02.523 --> 08:04.359
He's not dead till

08:02.523 --> 08:04.359
I say he's dead.

08:07.779 --> 08:08.905
[paint splattering]

08:16.871 --> 08:18.290
Did you work all night?

08:18.832 --> 08:19.707
Yeah.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.210
I'm headed into the office.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.586
What do you think?

08:28.467 --> 08:29.426
It's intense.

08:29.468 --> 08:30.718
Yeah, but is it....

08:31.928 --> 08:32.846
You know...[sighs]

08:32.887 --> 08:34.055
Finished?

08:35.765 --> 08:37.267
What do you think?

08:37.309 --> 08:38.685
They used to talk to me.

08:39.394 --> 08:41.062
Refuse the paint

08:39.394 --> 08:41.062
when I was done.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.024
And now?

08:45.484 --> 08:47.152
There's a lot of other noise.

08:48.653 --> 08:49.863
I know.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.158
Penthouse walls

08:53.200 --> 08:55.327
"echo with the sound

08:53.200 --> 08:55.327
of salesmen."

08:55.369 --> 08:57.412
That guy was an artist, right?

08:57.454 --> 08:59.247
-Neil Peart.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.247
-Yeah. You are, too.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.875
You have to remind yourself

08:59.289 --> 09:01.875
why you're painting it.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.795
You know, there's a

09:03.210 --> 09:05.795
piece of land in Vermont

09:05.837 --> 09:07.506
that I could buy.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.966
Beautiful spread.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.966
It's got trees, and a lake.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.552
Vermont's nice, but you

09:10.008 --> 09:12.552
can't let that be your reason.

09:12.593 --> 09:14.346
Oh, there are worse ones.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.181
You know that collector Lisa?

09:16.223 --> 09:17.765
I mean, she buys one painting

09:16.223 --> 09:17.765
that's a down payment.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.518
[cellphone vibrating]

09:21.936 --> 09:22.937
Hello?

09:22.979 --> 09:24.647
Yeah, hold on one second.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.483
Uh, this is the, uh,

09:26.525 --> 09:28.026
collector that I had dinner

09:26.525 --> 09:28.026
with the other night.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.737
-I want to take this.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.737
-Okay.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.616
My man, you found me.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.161
Yeah, you got

09:36.410 --> 09:38.161
a long reach, player.

09:39.496 --> 09:40.830
I know it.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.833
Yeah. [chuckles]

09:47.128 --> 09:49.214
[Chuck] Mr. Moody,

09:47.128 --> 09:49.214
the power we wield

09:49.256 --> 09:50.924
as attorneys general

09:50.965 --> 09:54.386
is akin to a V-12 engine

09:50.965 --> 09:54.386
in an Italian sports car.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.555
You can drive the speed limit

09:54.428 --> 09:56.555
most of the time,

09:56.596 --> 09:59.933
but once in a while, you gotta

09:56.596 --> 09:59.933
take that power out and gun it.

10:00.767 --> 10:03.311
And who would you like me

10:00.767 --> 10:03.311
to run down on the Autobahn?

10:04.438 --> 10:06.523
Go to court

10:04.438 --> 10:06.523
and get an injunction

10:06.565 --> 10:09.943
blocking Bobby Axelrod's

10:06.565 --> 10:09.943
acquisition of Plaintif-Full

10:09.984 --> 10:12.195
and the bank charter inside.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.406
That individual

10:12.237 --> 10:14.406
is not fit to own a bank.

10:14.448 --> 10:15.907
It's a Delaware corporation.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.867
So, you're the man to talk to.

10:17.909 --> 10:20.620
[Chuck] The man with his hand on

10:17.909 --> 10:20.620
the switch of Ol' Sparky,

10:20.661 --> 10:22.705
who can send this deal

10:20.661 --> 10:22.705
to Valhalla.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.832
Well, do I have a race car

10:24.874 --> 10:26.667
or an electric chair

10:24.874 --> 10:26.667
at my disposal?

10:26.709 --> 10:28.044
Both.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.004
It would have been

10:28.086 --> 10:30.004
real good of you

10:30.046 --> 10:32.340
to ask 24 hours ago,

10:32.382 --> 10:34.884
before you took a wrecking ball

10:32.382 --> 10:34.884
to Plaintif-Full.

10:34.926 --> 10:36.886
All without a call to me,

10:34.926 --> 10:36.886
by the way.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.348
In too much of a hurry

10:38.138 --> 10:40.348
to hand-deliver Axe a bank,

10:40.390 --> 10:41.558
I guess.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.727
You started this thing.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.438
And you did it without

10:44.769 --> 10:46.438
seeing the consequences.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.106
Now you want me to fix it?

10:48.148 --> 10:50.525
I'm asking you to take down

10:48.148 --> 10:50.525
a larger threat.

10:50.567 --> 10:54.737
My mistake doesn't have

10:50.567 --> 10:54.737
to snowball into<i> our</i> mistake.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.948
There's no

10:54.779 --> 10:56.948
legal basis for this...

10:56.990 --> 10:58.699
No. It would be a favor.

10:58.741 --> 10:59.909
Which we tend to repay.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.369
No, not tend to.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.204
Always will, and always have.

11:03.246 --> 11:07.000
Favors are not asked lightly

11:03.246 --> 11:07.000
and will not be ignored.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.543
You think this

11:07.041 --> 11:08.543
is the state that

11:08.585 --> 11:10.587
Pierre Samuel

11:08.585 --> 11:10.587
du Pont de Nemours built,

11:10.629 --> 11:13.465
with the cousin marrying

11:10.629 --> 11:13.465
and the wrestler murdering

11:13.507 --> 11:16.343
and all that French

11:13.507 --> 11:16.343
aristocracy nonsense?

11:16.384 --> 11:19.053
The glass shards

11:16.384 --> 11:19.053
on top of the wall,

11:19.095 --> 11:20.555
keep the lesser family out?

11:20.597 --> 11:22.307
No.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.476
This is the state

11:22.349 --> 11:24.476
that was built on corporations

11:24.518 --> 11:26.394
getting what they need,

11:26.436 --> 11:29.356
which is freedom from

11:26.436 --> 11:29.356
the yoke of tax burden.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.483
I don't believe

11:29.397 --> 11:31.483
corporations are people.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.944
They're better than people,

11:32.942 --> 11:34.944
because they don't fuck up

11:34.986 --> 11:36.571
when they get

11:34.986 --> 11:36.571
so obsessed with one thing

11:36.613 --> 11:37.989
they can't see reality.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.241
[sighing] So no,

11:40.283 --> 11:42.701
I'm not gonna participate

11:40.283 --> 11:42.701
in your agenda,

11:42.743 --> 11:44.871
while mine is part

11:42.743 --> 11:44.871
of a bigger economy.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.960
-[slaps armrests]

11:49.125 --> 11:50.960
-[sighs]

11:51.002 --> 11:53.046
But do consider

11:51.002 --> 11:53.046
shopping for some

11:53.087 --> 11:56.174
tax-free, high-end electronics

11:53.087 --> 11:56.174
before you go.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.509
[scoffs]

12:00.803 --> 12:03.056
I was in my Tiara 4300,

12:03.097 --> 12:05.433
throttle open, shakin'

12:03.097 --> 12:05.433
on the chop so hard,

12:05.475 --> 12:07.519
my dick chafed.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.519
[chuckles]

12:07.561 --> 12:09.479
And suddenly I realized

12:09.521 --> 12:11.356
I was the menace.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.940
I wasn't in the world,

12:12.982 --> 12:14.609
I was hurting it.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.777
And that was

12:14.651 --> 12:16.777
my moment of clarity.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.239
I didn't want to be that guy.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.239
And I called you.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.907
I remember.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.409
Hmm. And you got me here.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.742
[scoffs]

12:23.784 --> 12:25.786
Made me the man I wanted to be.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.289
Made me money doin' it.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.289
And that's not nothin'.

12:29.874 --> 12:32.126
We shared values.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.752
We still share values.

12:33.794 --> 12:36.172
[sighing] I don't know.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.882
I know what's in your head,

12:37.924 --> 12:40.218
and it's ancient history.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.179
What I did to David showed

12:40.260 --> 12:43.179
a lack of morality on my part,

12:43.221 --> 12:45.014
and I have to live with it.

12:45.056 --> 12:46.600
It's a heck of a heavy load.

12:46.641 --> 12:48.309
Yeah. It's yours to carry.

12:48.351 --> 12:49.728
It is.

12:49.768 --> 12:51.730
But who do you

12:49.768 --> 12:51.730
want in your corner?

12:51.770 --> 12:55.066
Someone who's never

12:51.770 --> 12:55.066
put money before humanity?

12:55.108 --> 12:57.360
Or do you want someone

12:55.108 --> 12:57.360
who knows the cost

12:57.402 --> 13:00.863
of putting humanity aside,

12:57.402 --> 13:00.863
and how it'll break you?

13:00.905 --> 13:03.116
Without my past,

13:03.157 --> 13:04.659
how would I have known

13:04.701 --> 13:06.620
how to lead you from

13:04.701 --> 13:06.620
that gas guzzling,

13:06.661 --> 13:09.581
ear shattering,

13:06.661 --> 13:09.581
overcompensating Tiara

13:09.623 --> 13:11.499
to a sailboat

13:11.541 --> 13:13.251
and to the present moment?

13:14.377 --> 13:16.212
[scoffs, sighs]

13:19.090 --> 13:20.675
Perfect people don't exist.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.136
But flawed people...

13:24.220 --> 13:28.099
who have taken a walk through

13:24.220 --> 13:28.099
their own wounded psyche,

13:28.141 --> 13:29.850
reforged themselves

13:29.892 --> 13:31.686
and come out stronger?

13:33.313 --> 13:35.315
We're the great hope

13:33.313 --> 13:35.315
for the species.

13:45.283 --> 13:47.118
I still think I have

13:45.283 --> 13:47.118
to pull my money.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.371
Fair enough.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.371
More than fair.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.292
Get up. Let me walk you out.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.752
Yeah.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.170
It's your money.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.630
You can take it right now,

13:58.672 --> 14:00.173
and you could

13:58.672 --> 14:00.173
walk out this door.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.840
Leave while I'm down.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.343
Tell yourself and everyone

14:03.384 --> 14:04.843
you did it because

14:03.384 --> 14:04.843
you're Matt Allen

14:04.885 --> 14:06.513
and you don't

14:04.885 --> 14:06.513
consort with my kind.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.389
Because you, Matt Allen,

14:08.431 --> 14:10.350
will not be associated

14:08.431 --> 14:10.350
with someone

14:10.391 --> 14:12.935
who could do something

14:10.391 --> 14:12.935
like this.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.358
But power is atomic.

14:19.526 --> 14:20.943
And eventually, this moment,

14:20.985 --> 14:23.029
this moment where one electron

14:23.070 --> 14:25.239
is slightly out of whack,

14:23.070 --> 14:25.239
will end,

14:25.281 --> 14:26.700
the world will

14:25.281 --> 14:26.700
right itself again.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.034
I'll be on top again.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.619
And the curious thing

14:29.661 --> 14:31.663
is that I will have

14:29.661 --> 14:31.663
forgotten your name.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.417
I don't believe in enemies.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.417
It's not that I don't have them,

14:36.459 --> 14:38.211
it's that when

14:36.459 --> 14:38.211
you become my enemy,

14:38.252 --> 14:39.504
my next move,

14:39.546 --> 14:40.630
my only move,

14:40.672 --> 14:42.757
is to continue to rise.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.759
While you will eddy.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.260
Sink.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.054
Not by my hand

14:48.095 --> 14:50.181
but by your lack

14:48.095 --> 14:50.181
of connection to me.

14:51.474 --> 14:52.933
So walk out with your money.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.310
It's yours.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.937
But you won't be done with me.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.107
As the song goes:

15:00.149 --> 15:02.485
"On every wall in place

15:02.527 --> 15:05.029
my fearsome name

15:02.527 --> 15:05.029
will be heard.

15:05.822 --> 15:08.199
I'm the atomic punk."

15:10.034 --> 15:11.703
I will remain so.

15:12.787 --> 15:14.163
And you, Matt,

15:14.205 --> 15:17.041
will simply evaporate.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.461
[sighs]

15:22.963 --> 15:24.632
You know what? I-- I think...

15:24.674 --> 15:26.467
Mike, sure,

15:26.509 --> 15:28.678
I'll stay. For now.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.806
Give it a quarter or two,

15:28.720 --> 15:31.806
see how this shakes out.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.434
Good call.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.606
I'm not doing that again.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.025
The save or the beat down?

15:43.067 --> 15:44.611
Because it was gorgeous.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.905
Big Cat Ernie Ladd level.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.657
How do you even

15:48.197 --> 15:49.657
know who that is?

15:49.699 --> 15:51.284
You don't watch wrestling.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.327
I'd have said like,

15:51.325 --> 15:53.327
Fafner clubbing Fasol

15:53.369 --> 15:55.747
to death in Das Rheingold,

15:53.369 --> 15:55.747
but I need you in the gutter,

15:55.789 --> 15:56.915
not the heavens.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.583
How do you even come up with it?

15:58.625 --> 15:59.918
I just start talking

15:58.625 --> 15:59.918
and magic comes out.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.544
Same with what

15:59.959 --> 16:01.544
I just saw you do.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.880
That was a

16:01.586 --> 16:03.880
Michael Thomas Aquinas Prince

16:03.922 --> 16:05.465
who I can help.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.300
That was the M-Tap

16:05.506 --> 16:07.300
I've been waiting for.

16:07.341 --> 16:08.927
I feel dirty.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.554
This shirt feels dirty.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.554
I want to change.

16:11.596 --> 16:13.180
This isn't who I am.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.181
What I built.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.642
You did build it.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.560
And now you have to defend it.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.437
That's who we have

16:17.602 --> 16:19.437
to be right now.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.355
You got hurt, we hurt back.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.065
You need to make Axe suffer.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.651
How?

16:24.692 --> 16:26.486
I figured out what

16:24.692 --> 16:26.486
the devil cares about.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.070
Pizza.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.989
First he overspent

16:28.112 --> 16:29.989
on a joint in Yonkers.

16:30.030 --> 16:32.283
But now he's invested

16:30.030 --> 16:32.283
in a new company

16:32.325 --> 16:34.118
that's getting buzzy.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.704
But the deal is way too

16:34.160 --> 16:36.704
favorable for his partners.

16:38.790 --> 16:39.916
And?

16:39.958 --> 16:41.584
Axe giving favorable terms?

16:41.626 --> 16:43.127
That means it matters to him.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.756
So, now we take it away.

16:46.798 --> 16:47.757
Painfully.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.551
I see the appeal.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.551
I really do.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.347
But this isn't the path for me.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.891
So, you exorcise your

16:54.388 --> 16:56.891
demons however you want.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.602
I need to face mine.

17:10.822 --> 17:13.199
[exhales] Okay, I gave you the

17:10.822 --> 17:13.199
entire trip back from Delaware

17:13.240 --> 17:15.284
and the car ride from

17:13.240 --> 17:15.284
Penn Station to get over it.

17:15.326 --> 17:17.954
And now I need to know:

17:15.326 --> 17:17.954
what is the plan,

17:17.996 --> 17:19.706
or the next move in the plan,

17:19.747 --> 17:21.666
or the next step in

17:19.747 --> 17:21.666
the move of the plan?

17:21.708 --> 17:24.460
Well, there is no plan.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.460
[slaps thigh]

17:24.502 --> 17:26.796
Despite your enthusiasm,

17:24.502 --> 17:26.796
there's no move.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.298
No, Moody is right.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.509
I made this shit soup,

17:29.340 --> 17:31.509
and now I have to sip it.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.302
Fine. You want

17:31.551 --> 17:33.302
to act existential,

17:33.344 --> 17:34.971
does not mean that I have to.

17:35.013 --> 17:36.931
No act.

17:35.013 --> 17:36.931
No, this right here,

17:36.973 --> 17:39.225
is what my alienist

17:36.973 --> 17:39.225
would call Anhedonia.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.310
The kind of paralysis

17:39.266 --> 17:41.310
that can only come

17:41.352 --> 17:43.396
when every move you make hurts.

17:44.104 --> 17:45.189
Wendy's gone.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.400
Her successor, also gone.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.276
Meanwhile, my enemies thrive.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.278
If we can pause with

17:49.318 --> 17:51.278
the Freudian analysis--

17:51.320 --> 17:53.406
Ribot came up with the concept.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.825
Freud got all the glory.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.326
So the least we can do

17:55.867 --> 17:57.326
is give ol' Theodule

17:57.368 --> 17:58.661
-his credit where it's due.

17:57.368 --> 17:58.661
-Okay,

17:58.703 --> 18:00.621
back from Europe

17:58.703 --> 18:00.621
to here in NYC.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.540
What if we pull the charter

18:00.663 --> 18:02.540
and get someone from the FDIC

18:02.582 --> 18:04.918
or OCC to review it

18:02.582 --> 18:04.918
for minor infractions?

18:04.959 --> 18:07.253
They're not gonna block

18:04.959 --> 18:07.253
this over a punctuation error.

18:07.294 --> 18:09.964
And Axe can resubmit

18:07.294 --> 18:09.964
a clean charter if they do.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.550
-We could...

18:11.049 --> 18:12.550
-Stop.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.134
I can't.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.134
And neither should you.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.888
We could threaten

18:14.176 --> 18:16.888
the board of the bank

18:16.930 --> 18:19.057
with investigations

18:16.930 --> 18:19.057
into personal misdeeds.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.600
Send them running.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.101
And give Axe a chance

18:20.641 --> 18:22.101
to form a board

18:22.142 --> 18:23.770
even more amenable

18:22.142 --> 18:23.770
to his goals?

18:23.811 --> 18:24.687
No.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.564
Okay, so...

18:26.606 --> 18:29.358
let's figure out

18:26.606 --> 18:29.358
what Moody really wants.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.610
I'm done.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.987
You're done. Go home.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.197
Stock up on canned goods

18:33.029 --> 18:35.197
for the coming plague.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.741
It all fucking blows.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.701
This is about your father.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.701
All of this.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.536
The dulled eyes,

18:38.743 --> 18:40.536
the defeated attitude,

18:40.578 --> 18:42.246
the backstroking through

18:40.578 --> 18:42.246
French psychology.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.164
But the fight must go on, Chuck.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.666
You have to go on.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.711
It's what he'd expect.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.089
So you say.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.132
So they say. So it is said.

18:53.173 --> 18:54.801
And so it is written.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.176
Doesn't mean it's true.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.894
-[crickets chirping]

19:02.892 --> 19:04.894
-[dogs barking]

19:12.443 --> 19:14.904
-Thank you for seeing me.

19:12.443 --> 19:14.904
-[glasses clinks]

19:14.946 --> 19:17.364
If you're here about the NDA,

19:14.946 --> 19:17.364
I know I broke it.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.617
I don't care.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.121
This isn't like before

19:20.660 --> 19:23.121
when I had no one on my side.

19:23.955 --> 19:26.124
I've got people helping me now.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.751
So whatever threat or lawsuit

19:28.793 --> 19:31.211
or blackmail you think

19:28.793 --> 19:31.211
you might have over me,

19:31.253 --> 19:32.505
you can forget it.

19:32.546 --> 19:34.256
I don't go looking for fights.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.259
Can't say the same

19:35.341 --> 19:37.259
for Bobby Axelrod.

19:39.887 --> 19:41.514
He's bankrolling

19:39.887 --> 19:41.514
your legal defense.

19:41.555 --> 19:43.349
He's making sure

19:41.555 --> 19:43.349
that I don't go broke

19:43.390 --> 19:44.642
for telling the truth.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.686
But you don't know the truth.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.270
Not the whole thing, at least.

19:49.647 --> 19:50.982
You only know

19:49.647 --> 19:50.982
what happened after.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.442
And now so does

19:51.024 --> 19:53.442
everyone else.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.613
Do you want to know

19:55.778 --> 19:57.613
about that night?

19:58.781 --> 19:59.657
With David?

20:09.792 --> 20:10.751
[swallows]

20:11.251 --> 20:13.212
After I showed him

20:11.251 --> 20:13.212
the plane ticket

20:13.253 --> 20:16.465
and the cashier's check,

20:13.253 --> 20:16.465
we went out for pancakes.

20:16.507 --> 20:18.676
I-- I don't know why pancakes,

20:16.507 --> 20:18.676
it's what he wanted.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.678
Uh, maybe it was to sober up.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.722
Or maybe it was

20:20.720 --> 20:22.722
all he could think of.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.348
Or maybe it was

20:22.763 --> 20:24.348
all he could eat

20:24.390 --> 20:26.392
because of all

20:24.390 --> 20:26.392
the drugs and the booze.

20:26.433 --> 20:30.063
We talked about the trip

20:26.433 --> 20:30.063
we were taking to Rio,

20:31.105 --> 20:32.940
the girls we would meet there,

20:34.483 --> 20:36.736
about the company

20:34.483 --> 20:36.736
we would start next.

20:36.777 --> 20:39.530
David wanted to replace

20:36.777 --> 20:39.530
modems and routers

20:39.572 --> 20:41.448
with something more secure.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.201
It was brilliant, his idea,

20:43.242 --> 20:46.120
but scattered, and I really wish

20:43.242 --> 20:46.120
I could remember it.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.956
Because I bet it

20:46.954 --> 20:48.956
would change the world.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.084
But I can't.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.877
Because that whole time

20:51.125 --> 20:52.877
eating pancakes,

20:52.919 --> 20:54.628
the only thing

20:52.919 --> 20:54.628
I could think of was

20:54.670 --> 20:56.923
how I had to get

20:54.670 --> 20:56.923
him on that plane.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.592
[chuckles softly]

21:00.300 --> 21:02.302
He was so happy

21:00.300 --> 21:02.302
in that moment...

21:03.804 --> 21:04.889
and funny.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.641
You know how he could

21:05.890 --> 21:07.641
get a joke going,

21:07.683 --> 21:10.853
and keep it going

21:07.683 --> 21:10.853
way longer than anybody else.

21:10.895 --> 21:13.106
Well, he was going and going.

21:13.147 --> 21:15.775
And all I had was the cold,

21:15.816 --> 21:19.319
hollow excitement of knowing

21:15.816 --> 21:19.319
that I was stealing from him.

21:21.488 --> 21:23.741
I told myself that it was

21:21.488 --> 21:23.741
because he wouldn't be able

21:23.783 --> 21:25.785
to handle the new situation

21:25.826 --> 21:27.787
or that he'd blow our deal.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.748
That it'd be too much for him.

21:32.250 --> 21:33.793
But deep down, I knew.

21:34.752 --> 21:36.295
I still know.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.423
I wanted it all for myself.

21:44.887 --> 21:46.847
You shouldn't have come.

21:46.889 --> 21:50.726
Please. I-- I understand that

21:46.889 --> 21:50.726
I can't get your forgiveness.

21:50.768 --> 21:53.020
Because what I did

21:50.768 --> 21:53.020
was unforgivable.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.605
But if there's...

21:55.689 --> 21:57.691
anything that I can do for you,

21:59.235 --> 22:00.820
anything at all,

22:00.861 --> 22:03.072
that will heal

22:00.861 --> 22:03.072
this thing between us.

22:04.406 --> 22:07.118
Or maybe just make us

22:04.406 --> 22:07.118
both feel better.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.953
Because I'm tired of hurting.

22:10.204 --> 22:11.289
Aren't you?

22:13.040 --> 22:14.333
Yeah, I am.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.377
But the funny thing is,

22:18.420 --> 22:20.006
it's decades later,

22:20.047 --> 22:22.549
and sometimes I can't

22:20.047 --> 22:22.549
picture David's face

22:22.591 --> 22:24.302
without looking at a photograph.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.387
You know, it's been so long.

22:28.806 --> 22:30.808
But the same thing

22:28.806 --> 22:30.808
keeps happening.

22:32.101 --> 22:34.854
People want me to tell them

22:32.101 --> 22:34.854
how to make them feel better.

22:35.938 --> 22:37.815
You want me to do

22:35.938 --> 22:37.815
your work for you,

22:37.857 --> 22:39.441
but I'm not going to.

22:39.483 --> 22:42.862
I've worked hard enough

22:39.483 --> 22:42.862
to get through this.

22:44.071 --> 22:46.364
So, if you're looking

22:44.071 --> 22:46.364
for absolution,

22:46.406 --> 22:48.408
you're gonna have

22:46.406 --> 22:48.408
to find it on your own.

22:49.576 --> 22:52.830
I want a path back to goodness.

22:54.957 --> 22:57.168
A way to be a force

22:54.957 --> 22:57.168
for good again.

22:58.211 --> 23:00.087
Yeah, I know you do, Michael.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.715
[scoffs] You do?

23:02.756 --> 23:04.508
Yeah.

23:04.550 --> 23:07.678
But I can't be the subject

23:04.550 --> 23:07.678
of that, or the object,

23:07.720 --> 23:10.056
or the road map.

23:10.097 --> 23:14.268
I mean, I can point you

23:10.097 --> 23:14.268
in the right direction.

23:17.479 --> 23:20.107
Stop ruining good people

23:20.149 --> 23:22.860
because you think

23:20.149 --> 23:22.860
you're better than them.

23:24.195 --> 23:27.198
You're not better than anyone.

23:36.290 --> 23:37.875
You blanked me

23:36.290 --> 23:37.875
this afternoon.

23:38.584 --> 23:39.919
Oh, you really had me running

23:39.960 --> 23:40.920
for those Philadelphias,

23:39.960 --> 23:40.920
though.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.380
[chuckles]

23:42.420 --> 23:43.547
Almost took the second game.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.174
No, you're just being kind.

23:45.216 --> 23:47.885
But there is another

23:45.216 --> 23:47.885
kindness you can do me.

23:49.136 --> 23:50.263
What do you need?

23:51.264 --> 23:53.391
Write my father's eulogy for me.

23:53.431 --> 23:56.894
Last time I wrote you a speech,

23:53.431 --> 23:56.894
you basically tore it up on TV.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.187
[chuckles]

23:58.229 --> 23:59.563
I'll give it.

23:59.605 --> 24:00.981
I believe I can

23:59.605 --> 24:00.981
do that much,

24:01.023 --> 24:02.733
get through the thing.

24:01.023 --> 24:02.733
But, uh...

24:03.859 --> 24:05.361
no, I can't bare the writing.

24:11.409 --> 24:13.119
These are my notes.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.621
Such as they are,

24:13.160 --> 24:15.621
the pertinent details.

24:16.372 --> 24:17.831
Whoa, Chuck.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.875
Let me just absorb

24:17.873 --> 24:19.875
this for a minute.

24:20.667 --> 24:22.795
No, yeah, sure,

24:20.667 --> 24:22.795
of course, natch.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.255
Do what you gotta.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.090
Chew it over

24:24.297 --> 24:26.090
with your burnt ends.

24:28.508 --> 24:30.261
I mean, the whole

24:28.508 --> 24:30.261
thing is ironic too,

24:30.303 --> 24:32.679
because of this persistent

24:30.303 --> 24:32.679
fantasy I used to have.

24:32.721 --> 24:33.847
About?

24:34.723 --> 24:36.434
Me, as a younger man,

24:36.474 --> 24:38.894
standing tall at his funeral.

24:38.936 --> 24:41.772
Strong arm around

24:38.936 --> 24:41.772
my grieving mother,

24:41.814 --> 24:43.983
all of New York in attendance

24:44.024 --> 24:47.320
as I delivered a profound

24:44.024 --> 24:47.320
and stirring eulogy.

24:47.361 --> 24:48.528
[chuckles]

24:50.572 --> 24:52.283
But in my fantasy, see,

24:52.325 --> 24:55.119
my father was also

24:52.325 --> 24:55.119
somehow alive...

24:56.162 --> 24:58.080
-Hmm.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.080
-...and witnessed the speech

24:58.122 --> 25:00.374
with all the pride and approval

25:00.416 --> 25:02.001
you can imagine.

25:02.042 --> 25:04.295
Strange as it is,

25:02.042 --> 25:04.295
it somehow makes sense.

25:04.337 --> 25:08.174
Yeah. Stopped having it

25:04.337 --> 25:08.174
when I became US attorney.

25:08.215 --> 25:11.344
Well, reaching that height,

25:08.215 --> 25:11.344
that achievement,

25:11.385 --> 25:13.387
puts you beyond the

25:11.385 --> 25:13.387
need for his approval.

25:13.429 --> 25:14.347
Maybe.

25:16.223 --> 25:19.143
Now, though, I've got this

25:16.223 --> 25:19.143
persistent sense of guilt,

25:20.311 --> 25:22.396
as if my reverie somehow...

25:23.689 --> 25:25.565
caused his current condition.

25:30.154 --> 25:32.614
You'll feel worse

25:30.154 --> 25:32.614
if you don't write it yourself.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.581
[indistinct office chatter]

25:44.293 --> 25:47.463
So, you spilled

25:44.293 --> 25:47.463
your pint of blood. Great.

25:47.505 --> 25:49.547
Nothing wrong with

25:47.505 --> 25:49.547
appeasing the old gods.

25:49.589 --> 25:51.175
I need a list of

25:49.589 --> 25:51.175
all the companies

25:51.217 --> 25:52.759
whose reputation

25:51.217 --> 25:52.759
and balance sheet

25:52.801 --> 25:54.261
are being hurt

25:52.801 --> 25:54.261
by their association

25:54.303 --> 25:55.804
with my name.

25:55.846 --> 25:57.348
All the good people

25:55.846 --> 25:57.348
who don't deserve

25:57.390 --> 25:59.058
to be collateral damage

25:57.390 --> 25:59.058
to my mistakes.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.309
So you can...

26:00.351 --> 26:02.436
Free them. Sell them off.

26:04.688 --> 26:06.524
It went that badly

26:04.688 --> 26:06.524
with the mother?

26:06.606 --> 26:08.442
She butchered me,

26:06.606 --> 26:08.442
like one of those buffaloes

26:08.484 --> 26:09.985
at the end of<i> Apocalypse Now.</i>

26:10.027 --> 26:13.239
We can't take

26:10.027 --> 26:13.239
a billion dollar plus loss

26:13.280 --> 26:15.032
so you can assuage

26:13.280 --> 26:15.032
your guilt over something

26:15.074 --> 26:16.742
you can't go back and change.

26:16.783 --> 26:18.536
Right now, this company

26:16.783 --> 26:18.536
is the house built on

26:18.576 --> 26:20.913
a Native American burial ground.

26:20.954 --> 26:23.040
It doesn't matter

26:20.954 --> 26:23.040
how good the house is.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.792
We have to start from scratch.

26:35.010 --> 26:37.137
Um, shark in the water,

26:35.010 --> 26:37.137
shark in the water.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.056
Meaning?

26:39.098 --> 26:40.682
There's a selloff happening.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.393
So I was trying to

26:40.724 --> 26:42.393
make it sound exciting.

26:42.435 --> 26:45.271
See? And it's all in

26:42.435 --> 26:45.271
the same sector.

26:48.315 --> 26:50.568
It's not a sector.

26:48.315 --> 26:50.568
It's a person. Mike Prince.

26:50.608 --> 26:53.028
We should be buying this.

26:50.608 --> 26:53.028
All of it.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.406
We'd own big swaths of

26:53.070 --> 26:55.406
the green energy market;

26:55.448 --> 26:57.241
-more than that.

26:55.448 --> 26:57.241
-How much to buy it all?

26:57.283 --> 26:58.700
More than we have on hand.

26:58.742 --> 26:59.743
I mean, I think

26:58.742 --> 26:59.743
more than we have.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.078
So how do we get it?

27:02.121 --> 27:03.205
Shit. Right.

27:03.247 --> 27:04.664
You have to ask Axe.

27:04.706 --> 27:05.791
Like an advance

27:04.706 --> 27:05.791
on your allowance.

27:05.832 --> 27:07.167
It's outside our guidance.

27:07.209 --> 27:08.710
I mean, it sucks

27:07.209 --> 27:08.710
to have to ask.

27:08.752 --> 27:10.170
But it will suck

27:08.752 --> 27:10.170
a fuck of a lot less

27:10.212 --> 27:11.964
when we own

27:10.212 --> 27:11.964
all of Prince's stuff.

27:12.005 --> 27:13.591
Which is exactly how

27:12.005 --> 27:13.591
I'm going to sell this to Axe.

27:13.631 --> 27:15.384
Buying Prince's companies

27:13.631 --> 27:15.384
feeds into his need

27:15.426 --> 27:16.718
to destroy Mike Prince.

27:16.760 --> 27:17.844
Go feed the need.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.555
Thank you. I think I will.

27:23.434 --> 27:25.102
Hey, I need to

27:23.434 --> 27:25.102
ask you something.

27:25.936 --> 27:27.563
Oh, yeah. Hold on a sec.

27:29.064 --> 27:30.441
[indistinct office chatter]

27:30.483 --> 27:31.609
Trying to connect with Axe.

27:31.649 --> 27:32.985
I'm on with him now.

27:36.696 --> 27:38.532
You seeing it?

27:38.574 --> 27:40.618
<i>Mike Prince spiraling out,</i>

27:38.574 --> 27:40.618
<i>hemorrhaging money?</i>

27:40.658 --> 27:42.828
<i>It's quaint.</i>

27:40.658 --> 27:42.828
<i>And also very satisfying.</i>

27:42.869 --> 27:45.122
Beyond satisfying,

27:42.869 --> 27:45.122
it gives us an advantage.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.124
<i>He's driving down the cost</i>

27:45.164 --> 27:47.124
<i>by flooding the market.</i>

27:47.166 --> 27:49.667
He's selling just to sell,

27:47.166 --> 27:49.667
which means we can buy it all.

27:49.709 --> 27:51.920
-I just need the leverage.

27:49.709 --> 27:51.920
-That's a splashy move

27:51.962 --> 27:53.671
and publicly

27:51.962 --> 27:53.671
humiliating for him.

27:53.713 --> 27:55.007
<i>Yeah...</i>

27:57.593 --> 28:00.678
No. I am not helping Prince

27:57.593 --> 28:00.678
cleanse his conscience.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.764
We'll never get

28:00.720 --> 28:02.764
this chance again.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.391
I know.

28:04.433 --> 28:05.976
Which is why I'm thinking

28:04.433 --> 28:05.976
I'd rather that you

28:06.018 --> 28:09.355
dump everything you have

28:06.018 --> 28:09.355
that coincides with him.

28:09.396 --> 28:11.773
<i>Actually, dump everything</i>

28:09.396 --> 28:11.773
<i>that you have</i>

28:11.815 --> 28:13.775
that shares even

28:11.815 --> 28:13.775
the tiniest overlap

28:13.817 --> 28:16.778
of Venn diagram with

28:13.817 --> 28:16.778
Mike Prince and his ideology.

28:16.820 --> 28:17.863
What?

28:17.904 --> 28:19.114
<i>Well, like you said,</i>

28:19.156 --> 28:20.866
<i>he's driving the price down.</i>

28:20.907 --> 28:22.868
Now I want you to make

28:20.907 --> 28:22.868
those companies worthless.

28:22.909 --> 28:25.078
Unproductive.

28:22.909 --> 28:25.078
This is insane.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.788
<i>What? Kicking Prince</i>

28:25.120 --> 28:26.788
<i>when he's down?</i>

28:26.830 --> 28:28.248
I'd say nothing

28:26.830 --> 28:28.248
could be saner.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.209
-Bobby.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.209
-This isn't profitable.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.751
You're going to ruin industries

28:31.793 --> 28:33.753
to prove a point

28:31.793 --> 28:33.753
you've already proven.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.755
<i>Plus, the Mase Carbon</i>

28:33.795 --> 28:35.755
<i>balance sheet will take a hit,</i>

28:35.797 --> 28:37.715
which will drive down the value

28:35.797 --> 28:37.715
of the associated companies.

28:37.757 --> 28:39.843
<i>Our P and L will</i>

<i>You know Taylor's right.</i>

28:40.802 --> 28:43.263
<i>I can see it in your eyes.</i>

[sighs]

28:49.562 --> 28:51.021
Okay.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.148
No, you're right. He's done.

28:53.190 --> 28:56.235
So Mase Carb can

28:53.190 --> 28:56.235
buy up Prince's positions?

28:56.276 --> 28:59.572
Yes. I'll give you the leverage

28:56.276 --> 28:59.572
outside the guidance.

28:59.613 --> 29:01.073
Thank you. I'll let you know

29:01.114 --> 29:03.033
how much

29:01.114 --> 29:03.033
we're able to scoop up.

29:08.664 --> 29:09.789
<i>How's our painter doing?</i>

29:09.831 --> 29:11.584
Fine.

29:11.625 --> 29:13.877
Fine, like I'll be

29:11.625 --> 29:13.877
seeing paintings

29:13.919 --> 29:16.255
for the big empty walls

29:13.919 --> 29:16.255
I have waiting for them?

29:19.592 --> 29:21.885
What did you like about

29:19.592 --> 29:21.885
his work when you saw it?

29:22.553 --> 29:23.970
[inhales]

29:24.012 --> 29:26.181
Well, the power,

29:24.012 --> 29:26.181
the strength.

29:26.223 --> 29:28.267
Not many out there

29:26.223 --> 29:28.267
who can make art

29:28.308 --> 29:29.976
that feels like it's breathing.

29:31.353 --> 29:32.854
Wait a minute.

29:31.353 --> 29:32.854
Why are you asking?

29:32.896 --> 29:33.813
Should I be worried?

29:34.856 --> 29:36.149
I don't know.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.652
He's off.

29:38.694 --> 29:40.987
No, no, that--

29:38.694 --> 29:40.987
that's too strong. He's...

29:42.364 --> 29:44.533
He's painting

29:42.364 --> 29:44.533
for other people.

29:44.575 --> 29:47.494
He's got collectors

29:44.575 --> 29:47.494
and commissions in his head.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.538
And that real estate

29:47.536 --> 29:49.538
is only for you?

29:49.580 --> 29:52.082
You know, he's actually

29:49.580 --> 29:52.082
got real estate there, too.

29:52.750 --> 29:54.334
For what it's worth,

Tanner was always

29:54.376 --> 29:56.754
supposed to be this.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.256
Successful, sought after.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.967
And he's lucky to have you

29:59.298 --> 30:01.967
to keep his head in the game.

30:02.760 --> 30:04.010
<i>I'm glad for you.</i>

30:04.052 --> 30:05.804
Thank you.

30:05.845 --> 30:08.641
But, I could, you know,

30:05.845 --> 30:08.641
if you wanted me to,

30:08.682 --> 30:10.350
take some pressure off, uh,

30:10.392 --> 30:12.728
<i>give him some room to think.</i>

30:12.770 --> 30:15.188
<i>Maybe call Lisa,</i>

30:12.770 --> 30:15.188
<i>give her two of mine</i>

30:15.230 --> 30:17.566
and then take

30:15.230 --> 30:17.566
my other two later.

30:17.608 --> 30:20.110
Oh, it would be fucking with

30:17.608 --> 30:20.110
another man's cash flow but,

30:20.152 --> 30:22.154
<i>you know, if that's</i>

30:20.152 --> 30:22.154
<i>what you think he needs.</i>

30:22.195 --> 30:24.531
<i>But the most important thing is</i>

30:22.195 --> 30:24.531
<i>he gets back on track, right?</i>

30:24.573 --> 30:25.991
Right.

30:26.032 --> 30:27.951
So I'll make the call?

30:32.122 --> 30:33.373
Maybe just leave it.

30:34.708 --> 30:35.793
Sure.

30:36.918 --> 30:38.253
I'm just trying to help.

30:38.295 --> 30:39.379
I know.

30:47.805 --> 30:50.516
-[elevator bell dings]

30:47.805 --> 30:50.516
-[indistinct office chatter]

30:51.057 --> 30:52.476
We got a problem.

31:04.154 --> 31:05.823
We got a problem.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.324
The pizza freighter broke down

31:05.864 --> 31:07.324
in the Atlantic.

31:07.366 --> 31:08.534
We're gonna miss

31:07.366 --> 31:08.534
our delivery window.

31:08.575 --> 31:09.909
<i>-Shit.</i>

31:08.575 --> 31:09.909
-Bad luck,

31:09.951 --> 31:11.077
you know,

31:09.951 --> 31:11.077
something like that.

31:11.119 --> 31:12.371
We need to call the distributor,

31:12.412 --> 31:13.622
the product guy,

31:12.412 --> 31:13.622
and let them know

31:13.664 --> 31:14.456
we're gonna be late.

31:14.498 --> 31:16.041
We show up late,

31:16.082 --> 31:17.917
we're gonna miss

31:16.082 --> 31:17.917
our launch with goPuff.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.753
They're gonna blow

31:17.959 --> 31:19.753
this 'za out.

31:19.795 --> 31:22.840
We won't get that momentum back

31:19.795 --> 31:22.840
for a year, maybe ever.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.758
There's no such thing

31:22.881 --> 31:24.758
as bad fucking luck,

31:24.800 --> 31:26.760
not when money's involved.

31:26.802 --> 31:28.970
Where exactly is

31:26.802 --> 31:28.970
this freighter?

31:30.556 --> 31:33.392
Okay, this is a satellite

31:30.556 --> 31:33.392
snapshot of every ship at sea,

31:33.433 --> 31:35.060
updated every 20 minutes.

31:35.101 --> 31:37.145
So where the fuck

31:35.101 --> 31:37.145
are our pizzas?

31:37.187 --> 31:40.232
Forty-four degrees,

31:37.187 --> 31:40.232
32 minutes, 23.8 seconds North

31:40.273 --> 31:43.443
by 25 degrees, seven minutes,

31:40.273 --> 31:43.443
51.6 seconds West.

31:45.111 --> 31:46.946
North Atlantic Ocean.

31:46.988 --> 31:48.699
The third ship

31:46.988 --> 31:48.699
carrying your pizzas

31:48.741 --> 31:51.660
broke down two hours ago.

31:51.702 --> 31:54.329
So now what?

31:51.702 --> 31:54.329
They rot at sea?

31:54.371 --> 31:55.955
Maybe we could find someone

31:54.371 --> 31:55.955
to fix the ship.

31:55.997 --> 31:57.750
Why did you say

31:55.997 --> 31:57.750
"broke down" like that?

31:57.791 --> 31:59.459
Because something is off.

31:59.501 --> 32:01.378
A dead ship,

31:59.501 --> 32:01.378
one without power,

32:01.420 --> 32:03.422
will drop anchor

32:01.420 --> 32:03.422
and put out a distress signal.

32:03.463 --> 32:05.632
Even if the ship drifted

32:03.463 --> 32:05.632
onto the anchor line,

32:05.674 --> 32:08.385
it would have drifted East

32:05.674 --> 32:08.385
along the wave path,

32:08.427 --> 32:10.888
and your boat has moved North.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.265
Somebody is fucking

32:10.929 --> 32:13.265
around with your boat.

32:18.311 --> 32:19.563

<i>Check your IB.</i>

32:24.526 --> 32:25.903
[mouse clicking]

32:27.780 --> 32:29.322
Shit, Axe, really?

32:29.364 --> 32:31.533
You're an executing trader.

32:31.575 --> 32:32.826
You got a problem executing?

32:32.868 --> 32:34.787
<i>No, Axe.</i>

32:34.828 --> 32:36.037
<i>But I have a problem trading</i>

32:34.828 --> 32:36.037
<i>these particular names</i>

32:36.079 --> 32:37.414
<i>without Taylor.</i>

32:38.206 --> 32:39.291
I hired you.

32:39.332 --> 32:40.333
You quit.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.752
<i>I hired you back.</i>

32:41.794 --> 32:43.169
<i>Let you walk back in here</i>

32:43.211 --> 32:44.713
<i>despite your lack of loyalty.</i>

32:44.755 --> 32:47.299
Because I knew,

32:44.755 --> 32:47.299
one day there would be

32:47.340 --> 32:49.342
a moment of truth, a reckoning.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.595
What I would see if

32:49.384 --> 32:51.595
you were still the kid

32:51.637 --> 32:53.722
that I pulled out of Aurora,

32:51.637 --> 32:53.722
sat in front of a bank

32:53.764 --> 32:56.558
<i>of screens and gave</i>

32:53.764 --> 32:56.558
<i>the secrets of the world.</i>

32:56.600 --> 32:58.685
<i>And enough money</i>

32:56.600 --> 32:58.685
<i>to move your mom</i>

32:58.727 --> 33:00.520
<i>out of a trailer into a house.</i>

33:02.981 --> 33:04.524
This is that reckoning.

33:05.734 --> 33:07.193
Fuck.

33:11.197 --> 33:12.365
[sighs]

33:13.784 --> 33:15.160
[thunder rumbles]

33:26.880 --> 33:28.966
You proud of putting good

33:26.880 --> 33:28.966
companies out of business?

33:29.007 --> 33:31.551
-I'm sorry. I'm not sure--

33:29.007 --> 33:31.551
-Is this what you wanted?

33:31.593 --> 33:33.178
To destroy the progress

33:31.593 --> 33:33.178
we both made?

33:33.219 --> 33:35.472
To set impact investing back?

33:35.514 --> 33:38.684
Every company you sold off today

33:35.514 --> 33:38.684
will likely fold,

33:38.725 --> 33:42.103
and that market share will

33:38.725 --> 33:42.103
go right back to the polluters,

33:42.145 --> 33:43.730
the child labor employers,

33:43.772 --> 33:45.106
the people we committed

33:43.772 --> 33:45.106
to taking down.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.483
Are you proud?

33:50.529 --> 33:51.738
Jesus.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.157
You didn't know.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.618
He did it without telling you.

33:57.160 --> 34:00.413
Well, I guess we

33:57.160 --> 34:00.413
all know just how much

34:00.455 --> 34:02.708
that shingle of yours is worth.

34:06.545 --> 34:07.921
Are you okay?

34:08.672 --> 34:09.840
No.

34:18.306 --> 34:19.683
What happened?

34:19.725 --> 34:20.976
Axe.

34:21.018 --> 34:22.895
Are you kidding me?

34:22.936 --> 34:25.397
So what, you were just following

34:22.936 --> 34:25.397
orders and that makes it okay?

34:25.438 --> 34:26.606
It does not make it okay.

34:26.648 --> 34:28.567
Explain yourself, Mafee.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.485
Axe. That's it.

34:30.527 --> 34:32.070
That's the explanation.

34:32.111 --> 34:33.321
What the fuck did

34:32.111 --> 34:33.321
we think would happen

34:33.363 --> 34:34.865
when we walked back in here?

34:34.907 --> 34:37.116
The fallout from this

34:34.907 --> 34:37.116
is cataclysmic.

34:37.158 --> 34:38.702
[Winston] You're damn right.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.119
This completely

34:38.744 --> 34:40.119
messes up our bonuses.

34:40.161 --> 34:41.621
[Rian] Not what I meant.

34:41.663 --> 34:42.789
Well, it's what I meant.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.374
Enough. I will fix this.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.500
Not as long as we're

34:44.416 --> 34:45.500
still reporting to--

34:45.542 --> 34:46.626
Not now, Rian.

34:52.173 --> 34:54.801
I spent my whole life

34:52.173 --> 34:54.801
building something additive.

34:54.843 --> 34:56.261
-Not your whole life.

34:54.843 --> 34:56.261
-Um-hmm.

34:56.302 --> 34:58.972
Some would argue

34:56.302 --> 34:58.972
that by virtue

34:59.014 --> 35:00.515
of just how much money you have,

35:00.557 --> 35:02.559
you have by definition

35:00.557 --> 35:02.559
done much wrong.

35:03.518 --> 35:05.604
So because I'm so rich,

35:03.518 --> 35:05.604
I'm inherently guilty?

35:05.645 --> 35:07.689
It's what I built a good

35:05.645 --> 35:07.689
chunk of my career on.

35:07.731 --> 35:09.524
Probably what drove me

35:07.731 --> 35:09.524
to that career.

35:09.566 --> 35:12.444
But I do believe you just

35:09.566 --> 35:12.444
said it better than I did.

35:12.485 --> 35:14.780
Wealth is always going to exist.

35:14.821 --> 35:16.239
Power along with it.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.199
People are so

35:16.281 --> 35:18.199
consumed with the idea

35:18.241 --> 35:20.118
that money buys freedom

35:18.241 --> 35:20.118
that they can't demand

35:20.159 --> 35:21.620
better of the powerful...

35:21.661 --> 35:23.162
or themselves.

35:23.204 --> 35:24.998
As soon as they gain

35:23.204 --> 35:24.998
some power of their own,

35:25.040 --> 35:27.417
they forget about better

35:25.040 --> 35:27.417
and just want to be rich.

35:27.459 --> 35:30.587
So the powerful have

35:27.459 --> 35:30.587
to demand it of ourselves.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.297
That's what I was trying to do.

35:32.338 --> 35:34.215
I can't save the world,

35:34.257 --> 35:36.051
but I was gonna leave it

35:34.257 --> 35:36.051
a lot better than I found it.

35:36.093 --> 35:39.137
And now I'm sucked into

35:36.093 --> 35:39.137
chaos by Bobby Axelrod.

35:40.305 --> 35:41.932
I can't arrest him

35:40.305 --> 35:41.932
because he's screwing

35:41.974 --> 35:43.058
with your savior complex.

35:43.100 --> 35:44.851
Would that I could.

35:44.893 --> 35:48.772
Bobby Axelrod has to be

35:44.893 --> 35:48.772
wiped off the face of the Earth.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.356
You're right.

35:51.357 --> 35:52.692
So do you want my help?

35:52.734 --> 35:53.902
No.

35:53.944 --> 35:55.487
-Hold on.

35:53.944 --> 35:55.487
-You came to me--

35:55.528 --> 35:56.905
He came to me and said

35:55.528 --> 35:56.905
he needed my help.

35:56.947 --> 35:58.073
Now I'm ready.

35:58.115 --> 35:59.783
I came to you when I needed you.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.451
And the getting was good.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.369
But you thought

36:01.493 --> 36:03.369
you were above me.

36:03.411 --> 36:06.665
And, now, Axe got a bank.

36:06.706 --> 36:08.291
Fuck, I gave him a bank.

36:08.333 --> 36:09.876
Me and her.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.586
And now that he's

36:09.918 --> 36:11.586
coming for you, [scoffs]

36:11.628 --> 36:13.755
you want me to what?

36:11.628 --> 36:13.755
Get hit with more shrapnel

36:13.797 --> 36:15.423
so you can campaign for a Nobel?

36:15.465 --> 36:16.675
No. Fuck no.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.510
Every time I move,

36:18.551 --> 36:20.971
I make his life better

36:18.551 --> 36:20.971
and mine worse.

36:21.013 --> 36:24.141
I even tried my luck

36:21.013 --> 36:24.141
with the Delaware AG

36:24.182 --> 36:26.101
only to be rolled into

36:24.182 --> 36:26.101
the street like a bum.

36:26.143 --> 36:27.936
So I've come to a halt.

36:29.437 --> 36:31.397
No, I can't lose

36:29.437 --> 36:31.397
any more of myself to this.

36:31.439 --> 36:32.607
You go figure it out.

36:32.649 --> 36:34.651
I'm offering titanic resources.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.195
Then what do you need us for?

36:44.410 --> 36:46.371
"That cupcake makes a mess,

36:44.410 --> 36:46.371
we got a case again."

36:46.412 --> 36:48.206
Well,

36:48.247 --> 36:50.208
it worked for Bobby D,

36:48.247 --> 36:50.208
I figured it was worth a shot.

36:50.249 --> 36:51.626
[chuckles]

36:53.419 --> 36:56.048
Okay, we can remake the order

36:53.419 --> 36:56.048
in Italy and reship.

36:56.089 --> 36:57.632
But that's two extra weeks.

36:57.674 --> 36:59.467
And then we lose

36:57.674 --> 36:59.467
the supermarket chains.

36:59.509 --> 37:02.303
Prince Company's got their mitts

36:59.509 --> 37:02.303
on the shipping line anyway.

37:02.345 --> 37:04.347
[sighs]

37:04.389 --> 37:06.683
All right, look, I'm gonna tell

37:04.389 --> 37:06.683
Axe to forget the whole deal.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.393
Give my cousin

37:06.725 --> 37:08.393
back his company.

37:08.434 --> 37:10.395
Anthony keeps banging out

37:08.434 --> 37:10.395
top-quality pies.

37:10.436 --> 37:11.980
At least he has two shops.

37:12.022 --> 37:13.314
That's more than

37:12.022 --> 37:13.314
what he was planning.

37:13.356 --> 37:14.900
No, you're not.

37:14.941 --> 37:17.360
Axe believes your cousin

37:14.941 --> 37:17.360
should be big-time.

37:17.402 --> 37:19.946
I have been charged with

37:17.402 --> 37:19.946
delivering your pizza empire,

37:19.988 --> 37:22.448
so to speak, and deliver it

37:19.988 --> 37:22.448
I fucking will,

37:22.490 --> 37:23.783
on time.

37:23.825 --> 37:24.868
How?

37:24.910 --> 37:27.370
Now tell me. Why Italy?

37:27.829 --> 37:29.164
The ovens.

37:35.378 --> 37:36.462
Il Duce.

37:36.504 --> 37:38.464
We have a move we can make.

37:38.506 --> 37:41.176
A warehouse filled with ovens

37:38.506 --> 37:41.176
and a small army of workers.

37:41.218 --> 37:43.344
It's gonna cost close

37:41.218 --> 37:43.344
to 10 million to do it.

37:43.386 --> 37:44.429
Keep it on schedule.

37:44.470 --> 37:46.098
And keep it quiet.

37:46.139 --> 37:47.682
It's money you won't

37:46.139 --> 37:47.682
recoup for a long time.

37:47.724 --> 37:50.102
Ten million to not let

37:47.724 --> 37:50.102
Mike Prince win a round?

37:51.061 --> 37:52.395
Consider the money spent.

37:52.437 --> 37:54.480
Go get those fuckin' ovens.

37:58.110 --> 38:00.653
We have hundreds

37:58.110 --> 38:00.653
of LLCs in Delaware.

38:00.695 --> 38:02.906
And lots of associates

38:00.695 --> 38:02.906
with more.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.324
I've been considering

38:02.948 --> 38:05.324
Wyoming instead.

38:05.366 --> 38:07.535
I've got a 3,000-acre

38:05.366 --> 38:07.535
spread there

38:07.577 --> 38:10.205
and it's the original home

38:07.577 --> 38:10.205
of the LLC.

38:10.247 --> 38:12.832
The American Bar Association

38:10.247 --> 38:12.832
just released a white paper

38:12.874 --> 38:14.834
on the Delaware pitfalls.

38:14.876 --> 38:17.587
Seems like a good time to

38:14.876 --> 38:17.587
take a billion out of the state.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.131
Is it only a billion?

38:19.172 --> 38:20.673
-A few.

38:19.172 --> 38:20.673
-Hmm.

38:22.592 --> 38:24.343
Well, that would be unfortunate.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.722
Taking out a cowboy-sized

38:25.804 --> 38:27.722
chunk of the LLCs

38:27.764 --> 38:30.391
in Delaware is "unfortunate"?

38:30.433 --> 38:32.144
I'd imagined

38:30.433 --> 38:32.144
the unemployment filings

38:32.185 --> 38:34.271
of registered agents alone

38:32.185 --> 38:34.271
would put a nice dent

38:34.312 --> 38:36.439
in anyone's reelection hopes.

38:36.481 --> 38:37.857
Or...

38:38.608 --> 38:39.651
Or?

38:40.526 --> 38:41.945
You can do me a favor,

38:41.987 --> 38:43.404
and I'll stay in Delaware

38:43.446 --> 38:45.991
and protect the LLC farms

38:43.446 --> 38:45.991
from litigation.

38:46.032 --> 38:49.202
Especially from a very eager

38:46.032 --> 38:49.202
New York State AG.

38:53.290 --> 38:55.167
You told me to figure it out.

38:53.290 --> 38:55.167
That's what I did.

38:55.208 --> 38:56.709
And?

38:56.751 --> 38:59.129
Moody was persuaded

38:56.751 --> 38:59.129
to get the court to name

38:59.171 --> 39:01.089
a special trustee to Axe's bank.

39:01.131 --> 39:03.175
An Irving Picard-like

39:01.131 --> 39:03.175
son of a gun.

39:03.216 --> 39:05.343
The guy who got back

39:03.216 --> 39:05.343
the Madoff money.

39:05.384 --> 39:07.095
[Prince] One penny at a time.

39:07.137 --> 39:09.472
Clawing every cent

39:07.137 --> 39:09.472
from the estate sale,

39:09.514 --> 39:11.266
finding every mattress

39:09.514 --> 39:11.266
they hid it under.

39:11.308 --> 39:12.350
Unrelenting.

39:12.391 --> 39:14.269
Well, Axe will hate that.

39:14.311 --> 39:16.646
[Prince] Someone who'll ride

39:14.311 --> 39:16.646
herd over the institution

39:16.688 --> 39:17.981
from the inside.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.066
Clock its every move.

39:20.108 --> 39:21.901
Report it all back.

39:21.943 --> 39:23.278
Block what he can.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.574
Okay, we're in.

39:35.790 --> 39:36.749
You knew.

39:36.791 --> 39:38.376
When you told me to blow,

39:38.417 --> 39:40.337
you knew I'd come back

39:38.417 --> 39:40.337
with something.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.379
I've seen<i> Cop Land.</i>

39:41.420 --> 39:42.839
Did I?

39:42.881 --> 39:44.716
I thought I meant it

39:42.881 --> 39:44.716
at the time.

39:44.757 --> 39:46.509
But we're here now.

39:46.551 --> 39:48.803
Yeah.

39:48.845 --> 39:50.847
Yeah, we'll need someone

39:48.845 --> 39:50.847
who's served on a bank board.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.891
Someone who's known for being

39:50.889 --> 39:52.891
tough on the institutions

39:52.932 --> 39:54.851
they're a board member of,

39:52.932 --> 39:54.851
not a yes man.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.728
Someone who won't care

39:54.893 --> 39:56.728
if they get booted

39:56.769 --> 39:58.271
a few months in

39:56.769 --> 39:58.271
due to politics.

39:58.313 --> 40:00.690
Someone who will

39:58.313 --> 40:00.690
go down swinging.

40:02.108 --> 40:04.194
Oh, I have just the guy.

40:09.324 --> 40:10.909
[machine beeps softly]

40:18.666 --> 40:20.085
Dad?

40:21.086 --> 40:22.545
[snores]

40:23.629 --> 40:25.673
Hey.

40:25.715 --> 40:28.051
It's the son who can't

40:25.715 --> 40:28.051
seem to come through.

40:28.509 --> 40:30.970
Well, it is true.

40:31.012 --> 40:33.098
I can't get you a kidney

40:31.012 --> 40:33.098
by any moral

40:33.139 --> 40:35.225
or legal means.

40:35.267 --> 40:36.684
But, [sighs]

40:36.726 --> 40:38.728
what if I could give you

40:36.726 --> 40:38.728
a reason to live?

40:38.770 --> 40:40.355
Huh.

40:40.397 --> 40:42.357
You mean other than

40:40.397 --> 40:42.357
my wife and child?

40:42.399 --> 40:44.025
Positive reinforcement

40:44.067 --> 40:46.194
never has been your

40:44.067 --> 40:46.194
<i>raison d'être.</i>

40:47.486 --> 40:50.240
No, you love power

40:47.486 --> 40:50.240
via destruction,

40:50.282 --> 40:52.033
a motivation

40:50.282 --> 40:52.033
you have handed down to me

40:52.075 --> 40:54.577
and could bestow

40:52.075 --> 40:54.577
on your daughter

40:54.619 --> 40:56.246
if you live long enough.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.873
Oh, she's meant

40:56.955 --> 40:58.873
for something better.

40:58.915 --> 41:00.458
Oh, I have no doubt.

41:01.918 --> 41:04.170
But the chance

41:01.918 --> 41:04.170
to be in the game,

41:05.255 --> 41:06.881
to fuck with

41:05.255 --> 41:06.881
someone else's power

41:06.923 --> 41:08.383
and take it for yourself,

41:08.425 --> 41:10.927
you can't deny

41:08.425 --> 41:10.927
that would feel good.

41:10.969 --> 41:14.139
Especially if that power

41:10.969 --> 41:14.139
was coming from Bobby Axelrod.

41:14.847 --> 41:17.309
I would enjoy seeing him squirm.

41:17.350 --> 41:19.394
Better yet,

41:17.350 --> 41:19.394
you would be the reason

41:19.436 --> 41:21.313
for said squirming.

41:21.354 --> 41:23.648
He just got himself a bank.

41:23.689 --> 41:25.942
And the bank requires a trustee.

41:27.360 --> 41:30.947
Someone with the power

41:27.360 --> 41:30.947
to torture his every decision,

41:30.989 --> 41:33.241
to turn the thing

41:30.989 --> 41:33.241
he wants so badly

41:33.283 --> 41:35.660
into a cilice

41:35.701 --> 41:38.037
that he can't take off.

41:38.079 --> 41:40.248
Someone with

41:38.079 --> 41:40.248
experience in banking,

41:40.290 --> 41:42.959
committed to making Axelrod

41:40.290 --> 41:42.959
so uncomfortable

41:43.001 --> 41:45.795
he rips at his own skin.

41:47.588 --> 41:49.382
That's a job for a fighter.

41:51.343 --> 41:53.386
Man with something

41:51.343 --> 41:53.386
left in the tank.

41:55.347 --> 41:58.557
I could yank his puppet strings.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.727
Oh, yes, you could.

42:06.441 --> 42:07.942
[horns honking]

42:12.864 --> 42:14.240
Scooter.

42:15.992 --> 42:18.036
I just happened to be in

42:15.992 --> 42:18.036
your neighborhood grocer.

42:18.077 --> 42:19.787
That's hard to believe.

42:19.829 --> 42:21.580
Nothing is hard to believe

42:21.622 --> 42:23.791
if you have the will

42:21.622 --> 42:23.791
to make it happen.

42:27.420 --> 42:29.297
Wait, that's not one of--

42:29.339 --> 42:32.008
Yes. It certainly is.

42:32.717 --> 42:35.136
I'm wondering if we can

42:32.717 --> 42:35.136
file the insurance claim

42:35.178 --> 42:37.472
on the spoiled merchandise

42:35.178 --> 42:37.472
directly with Prince.

42:37.514 --> 42:39.265
You know, since you tools

42:39.307 --> 42:41.059
bought into

42:39.307 --> 42:41.059
that shipping company.

42:42.060 --> 42:45.063
Oh, you should try one of these.

42:45.104 --> 42:46.564
Fucking delicious.

42:46.605 --> 42:48.525
Freezer case is full of 'em.

42:57.116 --> 43:00.745
Your LLC office in Delaware

42:57.116 --> 43:00.745
is a literal post office box.

43:00.786 --> 43:02.747
Our bank is real, though.

43:03.581 --> 43:05.417
I imagine you want it to be.

43:05.458 --> 43:07.126
[inhales] What's the problem

43:07.168 --> 43:08.961
that brought you

43:07.168 --> 43:08.961
all this way north?

43:09.879 --> 43:11.672
Some things have changed.

43:11.714 --> 43:13.716
In my honest assessment

43:11.714 --> 43:13.716
of your past,

43:13.758 --> 43:16.010
I've come to believe

43:13.758 --> 43:16.010
that you require oversight.

43:16.052 --> 43:19.264
A trustee to look after

43:16.052 --> 43:19.264
consumer finance protection.

43:19.305 --> 43:21.015
Someone you'll need

43:19.305 --> 43:21.015
to run every move by.

43:21.057 --> 43:22.100
Every move?

43:22.141 --> 43:23.518
Pretty much.

43:24.352 --> 43:25.937
And if we refuse?

43:25.978 --> 43:27.980
I cancel your

43:25.978 --> 43:27.980
certificate of formation.

43:28.022 --> 43:30.483
Do we get to see a shortlist?

43:30.525 --> 43:32.360
[clicks tongue, inhales]

43:41.244 --> 43:42.661
[scoffs]

43:42.703 --> 43:45.164
That is a short fucking list.

43:45.206 --> 43:48.334
Charles Rhoades Senior has

43:45.206 --> 43:48.334
been selected and approved.

43:48.376 --> 43:50.503
We'll appeal this decision.

43:48.376 --> 43:50.503
I'll sue you.

43:50.545 --> 43:52.547
Oh, I imagine you will.

43:54.257 --> 43:56.509
[inhales] Well, I guess

43:54.257 --> 43:56.509
I will see you across

43:56.551 --> 43:58.636
a courtroom

43:56.551 --> 43:58.636
to hash this out...

43:58.677 --> 44:01.306
in 18 months to two years,

44:01.347 --> 44:03.224
when the case finally

44:01.347 --> 44:03.224
comes up for trial.

44:03.266 --> 44:05.101
In the meantime,

44:05.143 --> 44:07.312
please see that

44:05.143 --> 44:07.312
Mr. Rhoades is welcome.

44:08.687 --> 44:09.772
Gentlemen.

44:12.984 --> 44:14.986
[door opens, closes]

44:16.862 --> 44:18.573
I need Wendy's research,

44:18.615 --> 44:20.116
what she was working on

44:18.615 --> 44:20.116
in the employee records

44:20.158 --> 44:22.118
when Spyros ratted her out.

44:35.881 --> 44:37.383
You reorienting where you work?

44:38.343 --> 44:39.511
Reorienting.

44:39.552 --> 44:41.262
That's a word for it.

44:41.304 --> 44:44.932
Another word for it is

44:41.304 --> 44:44.932
shutting it the fuck down.

44:46.601 --> 44:48.894
Try using a word or two

44:46.601 --> 44:48.894
that'll make sense to me.

44:48.936 --> 44:53.232
Axe. Used his black magic

44:48.936 --> 44:53.232
to get my commission squashed.

44:54.066 --> 44:56.068
One thing I can't stand

44:54.066 --> 44:56.068
is getting fucked with.

44:56.110 --> 44:57.736
Is it all bad though?

44:59.322 --> 45:00.948
Give you back your freedom.

45:00.990 --> 45:03.535
You can just paint

45:00.990 --> 45:03.535
like you used to.

45:03.576 --> 45:05.911
Yeah, I had that

45:03.576 --> 45:05.911
for a long time.

45:06.745 --> 45:08.373
This was something new.

45:08.414 --> 45:09.374
I kind of liked it.

45:09.415 --> 45:11.501
You think you did.

45:11.543 --> 45:14.879
But I saw the look in your eye

45:11.543 --> 45:14.879
when you were painting that

45:15.838 --> 45:17.923
and it lit me up.

45:17.965 --> 45:21.219
Because that was you

45:17.965 --> 45:21.219
in it for yourself.

45:22.094 --> 45:23.971
Did you know Axe

45:22.094 --> 45:23.971
was gonna do this?

45:26.432 --> 45:27.850
Oh, wait a minute.

45:27.892 --> 45:30.186
Was-- Was this

45:27.892 --> 45:30.186
your fuckin' idea?

45:30.228 --> 45:31.270
No.

45:31.812 --> 45:33.356
Not my suggestion.

45:33.398 --> 45:35.107
But we did have

45:33.398 --> 45:35.107
a conversation about it

45:35.149 --> 45:38.444
and he thought

45:35.149 --> 45:38.444
it'd be... helpful.

45:38.486 --> 45:39.820
Wow. Shit.

45:39.862 --> 45:41.406
You trying to help me,

45:41.447 --> 45:43.074
or are you trying

45:41.447 --> 45:43.074
to help me stay broke?

45:43.115 --> 45:45.951
You have a personal relationship

45:43.115 --> 45:45.951
with every painting.

45:45.993 --> 45:47.370
A fucking love affair.

45:47.412 --> 45:48.871
Or you do with the good ones.

45:48.913 --> 45:50.206
