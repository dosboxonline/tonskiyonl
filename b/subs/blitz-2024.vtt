WEBVTT

01:25.419 --> 01:27.461
Right, it's down there!

01:27.462 --> 01:30.465
Coming through! I'm coming through!

01:31.383 --> 01:33.177
Get your fag out your mouth!

01:45.230 --> 01:46.898
- Who's got the pipe?
- We need more pressure!

01:46.899 --> 01:48.775
- Who's got the pipe?
- Pour on!

01:53.030 --> 01:55.324
- Water! Come on!
- Pour on!

02:21.850 --> 02:24.686
Hold it!

02:30.067 --> 02:31.276
Pick it up!

02:42.704 --> 02:45.499
Watch yourself. Forward! Go forward!

03:02.975 --> 03:05.769
Come on! Go! Grab the hose!

05:33.500 --> 05:34.751
Play the drums.

05:45.554 --> 05:48.015
And do it... And feel it
through your whole body.

06:00.402 --> 06:01.528
Make a wish.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.407
Think.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.828
- One wish?
- One wish.

06:27.054 --> 06:30.432
What a lovely boy. What a handsome--

06:32.017 --> 06:33.018
Dad!

06:33.769 --> 06:34.770
Come on.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.028
Come on.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.408
Dad!

06:56.708 --> 06:58.084
Come on. We're nearly there.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.253
This station is closed!

07:00.254 --> 07:01.796
We need somewhere to shelter!

07:01.797 --> 07:04.507
You should know
that the shelter is not provided!

07:04.508 --> 07:07.885
- Open the gate!
- Move back!

07:07.886 --> 07:10.346
This station is not
an authorized air raid shelter.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.557
The shelters are full.
Where were we supposed to go, eh?

07:12.558 --> 07:13.641
Stay close.

07:13.642 --> 07:16.727
If you have shelters at home,
you can take cover there.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.772
A sheet of corrugated iron to put
in your garden if you've got one.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.148
- You're having a laugh!
- Move back,

07:21.149 --> 07:22.233
or someone's gonna get hurt!

07:22.234 --> 07:26.196
The only one who's gonna get hurt here,
mate, is you if you don't let us in!

07:32.411 --> 07:34.745
- Force 'em open!
- Let go!

07:34.746 --> 07:36.623
Hold them back!

07:37.165 --> 07:41.586
We've got kids here!
For God's sake, open the gates!

07:41.587 --> 07:44.463
- Away from the gate!
- We've got children here!

07:44.464 --> 07:46.883
- Open the gates!
- Inspector, it's against the law!

07:46.884 --> 07:49.135
These people are hopelessly exposed!

07:49.136 --> 07:52.264
I'm ordering you one last time.
Open the gates!

07:53.515 --> 07:54.391
Open 'em up!

07:55.642 --> 07:57.894
- Get inside!
- Go on, George.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.980
- Dad, you all right?
- Yes, love, I'm all right.

08:06.695 --> 08:09.031
- Go on, George.
- Take cover, George.

08:09.948 --> 08:13.368
That way! Round here.

08:17.206 --> 08:19.499
Come on, love. Let's go down to the back.

08:22.753 --> 08:25.338
They're bleeding cowards!
That's what you are!

08:25.339 --> 08:26.631
How could you leave them here?

08:26.632 --> 08:28.008
Go on, George.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.526
Watch out.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.446
There.

08:50.489 --> 08:51.490
Go round there.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.413
It's gonna be all right, Olly.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.208
I won't leave you. You're safe with me.

09:02.209 --> 09:06.463
Hey, it's not fair on him, Rita.
You gotta let him go.

09:07.965 --> 09:08.966
Yeah.

09:11.176 --> 09:12.176
It's all right, Olly.

09:12.177 --> 09:16.348
Me, you, Mum and Granddad,
we'll be home in the morning.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.142
Here you are. George.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.199
This one?

09:52.968 --> 09:55.262
Why can't you come with me?

09:57.389 --> 10:01.185
Sweetheart, I told you,
it's an adventure for children only.

10:01.977 --> 10:03.394
Grown-ups not allowed.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.855
But it's gonna be great.

10:05.856 --> 10:08.275
- You're gonna make new friends.
- My friends are here.

10:09.026 --> 10:12.278
Yeah, well, you'll play games
in the countryside.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.654
That'll be nice.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.573
There'll be cows and horses and sheep--

10:15.574 --> 10:17.034
But they smell.

10:17.868 --> 10:19.494
I want to stay with you.

10:21.246 --> 10:22.372
Yeah, I know.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.421
It's only until all this is over.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.174
And then the schools'll open again
and life will get back to normal.

10:33.175 --> 10:34.885
I promise.

10:35.844 --> 10:39.264
Please, Mum, don't send me away.

10:46.980 --> 10:47.981
Here.

10:55.739 --> 10:57.490
Your dad would want you to have it.

10:57.491 --> 10:58.575
How do you know?

10:59.326 --> 11:02.119
I know because
that's the kind of man he was.

11:02.120 --> 11:05.749
Because you are his son,
and it belongs to you now.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.837
And it's gonna keep you safe, all right?

11:10.963 --> 11:11.964
Yeah?

11:18.720 --> 11:20.596
Put your shirt on and put your jacket on.

11:20.597 --> 11:21.890
Come downstairs, yeah?

11:41.493 --> 11:44.328
<i>To all parents
who still have children at home,</i>

11:44.329 --> 11:47.082
<i>you have another opportunity
to evacuate them.</i>

11:47.875 --> 11:51.002
<i>There is a possibility
that they will be uncomfortable</i>

11:51.003 --> 11:52.504
<i>or that they will be homesick.</i>

11:53.630 --> 11:56.299
<i>But the alternative could be unthinkable.</i>

11:56.300 --> 11:59.553
George! Hurry up, son.
Your breakfast is ready.

12:00.721 --> 12:01.929
<i>The long night of multiple raids...</i>

12:01.930 --> 12:03.639
- You all right, love?
- Yeah.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.391
<i>...shortly after eight o'clock,</i>

12:05.392 --> 12:08.144
<i>when the warning sirens sounded
once again.</i>

12:08.145 --> 12:11.022
<i>The raiders were met
by a heavy barrage of AA guns</i>

12:11.023 --> 12:13.150
<i>but some of them were able to get over...</i>

12:15.527 --> 12:16.653
It's gonna be all right.

12:17.821 --> 12:20.490
<i>A medical officer was injured
and medical staff...</i>

12:21.867 --> 12:24.952
<i>Attacks are evidently
in the nature of terror raids.</i>

12:24.953 --> 12:29.040
<i>The people of London are not to be
intimidated by Nazi frightfulness.</i>

12:29.041 --> 12:33.378
<i>London is carrying on much as usual
as inhabitants readjust...</i>

12:43.180 --> 12:45.848
Jack? Still got some breakfast
on the stove.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.266
No, I'm all right, thanks, Gerald.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.810
I need to check on Mum,
I'm back on duty in a few hours.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.313
Give her my best.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.026
Bye, Olly.

12:56.652 --> 12:58.319
- Good luck today.
- Oh, thanks.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.947
You be a good boy.

13:01.240 --> 13:02.865
Look after yourself, my boy.

13:02.866 --> 13:06.452
And don't forget,
be brave and stand up to bullies.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.205
What do we always say about them?

13:08.747 --> 13:10.748
All mouth and no trousers?

13:10.749 --> 13:13.669
Pardon? I didn't hear what you said.
Speak up please.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.088
All mouth and no trousers.

13:17.089 --> 13:18.924
Correct. Come here.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.429
Here you are. This is for emergencies.

13:25.389 --> 13:27.599
- Come on.
- Thank you, Granddad.

13:35.357 --> 13:38.068
Old iron! Any ol' iron!

13:39.069 --> 13:41.196
Old iron! Any ol' iron!

13:43.699 --> 13:45.826
Old iron! Any ol' iron!

13:47.160 --> 13:49.121
Old iron! Any ol' iron!

13:50.789 --> 13:52.791
Old iron! Any ol' iron!

13:53.834 --> 13:56.336
Old iron! Any ol' iron!

14:50.933 --> 14:53.560
- Yeah?
- George Hanway, nine years old.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.396
Here you go.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.450
Keep moving along the platform!

15:11.119 --> 15:12.120
All right?

15:14.540 --> 15:15.541
Love ya.

15:16.792 --> 15:18.085
Don't forget to be a good boy.

15:18.961 --> 15:21.879
And don't wipe your nose on your sleeve.
Use your hanky.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.715
I hate you.

15:24.633 --> 15:25.843
George!

15:26.468 --> 15:28.553
This way! Get into the cars!

15:28.554 --> 15:30.264
George, come back!

15:31.974 --> 15:34.892
- George!
- Rita!

15:34.893 --> 15:37.270
- All aboard!
- Rita, calm yourself. He'll be all right.

15:37.271 --> 15:38.813
I need to say goodbye properly.

15:38.814 --> 15:39.939
- George!
- Rita!

15:39.940 --> 15:41.358
Stand back please!

15:48.574 --> 15:50.616
All aboard!

15:50.617 --> 15:52.618
George!

15:52.619 --> 15:57.832
George, please look at me, darling!
Darling, why aren't you looking at me?

15:57.833 --> 16:00.627
Darling, please! I love you!

16:01.879 --> 16:02.713
Can you open this--

16:09.386 --> 16:13.389
Please! No. George, please!

16:13.390 --> 16:16.058
- Please! Look at me! Darling, please!
- He'll be all right, love.

16:16.059 --> 16:18.478
Some nice family
will be taking care of him. Don't worry.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.398
Get off of me!

16:22.399 --> 16:23.483
George!

17:07.109 --> 17:08.153
All right?

17:10.696 --> 17:14.491
Yeah, I know. It's bloody hard
sending 'em away like that.

17:14.492 --> 17:15.826
But keep your chin up, eh?

17:15.827 --> 17:18.788
Oh, come on, Rita, love. Cheer up.

17:18.789 --> 17:21.874
Look on the bright side.
You get to be on your own.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.125
You can enjoy yourself.

17:23.126 --> 17:25.837
He'll be well looked after. Otherwise
they wouldn't have evacuated them.

17:25.838 --> 17:28.298
It'd be like going to Blackpool. Better!

17:30.092 --> 17:32.094
Guess you're saving your voice
for later, eh?

17:33.679 --> 17:36.139
I imagine you're a bit nervous.
I would be.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.224
You sure you're up to it?

17:38.225 --> 17:40.184
Course she is.
We're all looking forward to it!

17:40.185 --> 17:41.143
It's her decision.

17:41.144 --> 17:43.187
Everyone and their grandmother's
gonna be listening.

17:43.188 --> 17:45.731
Yeah, I know that, but it'll make her
feel better, wouldn't it?

17:45.732 --> 17:48.317
She ain't just a mum.
She's got a lovely voice.

17:48.318 --> 17:49.862
My bloody hand.

17:51.321 --> 17:53.906
- Try and pull. You're filthy.
- You try and pull yours.

17:53.907 --> 17:57.326
Right, ladies, can we stop
the chitchat and get on with it please?

17:57.327 --> 18:00.872
Right, yes. I know today is a special day

18:00.873 --> 18:03.708
but that does not permit you
to take your eye off the ball.

18:03.709 --> 18:07.128
There are boys out there, our boys,
relying on us.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.672
Relying on you!

18:09.256 --> 18:10.257
God help 'em.

18:12.009 --> 18:13.677
I'll give him bloody work.

18:14.720 --> 18:15.721
Have some of that!

18:18.390 --> 18:19.391
All right, Tilda!

18:19.975 --> 18:21.310
You show 'em, girl.

18:23.812 --> 18:24.645
What're you like?

18:24.646 --> 18:26.148
Bloody misery, isn't he?

19:54.903 --> 19:57.322
So obviously, we're playing out here.

20:19.595 --> 20:21.679
No feet on the seats, please,
boys and girls.

20:21.680 --> 20:24.974
Oy, get down from there immediately, son.
It's not safe.

20:24.975 --> 20:26.392
Sorry.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.477
All right?

20:35.819 --> 20:37.320
Temper, temper.

20:37.321 --> 20:39.907
You look like my dog. Where's your tail?

20:40.616 --> 20:41.908
Leave him alone!

20:41.909 --> 20:45.119
- He's crying!
- Missing Mummy, are ya?

20:45.120 --> 20:46.495
Leave him alone, would ya?

20:46.496 --> 20:49.248
What's it to you? Is he your fella?

20:49.249 --> 20:50.666
Oh, shut up.

20:50.667 --> 20:51.919
That's enough.

20:52.920 --> 20:55.880
If I hear another word
from you or anyone else,

20:55.881 --> 20:58.799
you'll be sitting in the guards'
compartment for the rest of the journey.

20:58.800 --> 20:59.885
Now then.

21:05.766 --> 21:07.518
Who's a good boy?

21:11.480 --> 21:16.193
All right, who wants to fight? You? You?

21:16.985 --> 21:18.237
Which one of ya?

21:21.240 --> 21:24.201
I thought so. All mouth and no trousers.

21:32.209 --> 21:35.379
You showed them.
My name's Cathy. What's yours?

21:36.922 --> 21:37.923
George.

21:44.930 --> 21:47.348
- George, tea.
- All right.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.559
Come on then. You gonna bowl or what?

21:49.560 --> 21:53.354
Hold your horses.
Further back. Get further back!

21:53.355 --> 21:55.523
Come on.

21:55.524 --> 21:57.192
Right, you've asked for it.

22:00.445 --> 22:02.280
Catch it!

22:02.281 --> 22:04.324
- I've got it!
- I've got it.

22:06.201 --> 22:07.243
Six!

22:07.244 --> 22:10.371
What's the matter with you both?
Bloody butterfingers!

22:10.372 --> 22:12.416
George, tea, now.

22:17.546 --> 22:19.923
Go home to Mummy, you Black bastard you.

22:33.812 --> 22:37.440
<i>I'm savin' my love for you</i>

22:37.441 --> 22:38.859
All right, George?

22:40.903 --> 22:42.529
All right? What's the matter, mate?

22:43.280 --> 22:45.866
- Nothing.
- Well, it don't look like nothing.

22:47.826 --> 22:49.577
Gonna have a sing with us?

22:49.578 --> 22:52.623
What happened? You all right?

22:56.084 --> 22:57.084
Shall we have a singsong?

22:57.085 --> 23:00.796
<i>I'm savin' my love for you</i>

23:00.797 --> 23:01.882
Here we go.

23:02.549 --> 23:03.550
- Ready?
- Ready?

23:05.802 --> 23:11.557
<i>Like Jack Horner
In the corner</i>

23:11.558 --> 23:13.976
<i>Don't go nowhere</i>

23:13.977 --> 23:16.688
<i>What do I care?</i>

23:17.523 --> 23:23.903
<i>Your kisses are worth waitin' for</i>

23:23.904 --> 23:27.449
<i>Believe me</i>

23:27.991 --> 23:29.534
- Mum!
- Come on.

23:29.535 --> 23:33.830
<i>I don't go out late
Don't care to go</i>

23:34.748 --> 23:40.461
<i>I'm home about 8:00
Just me and my radio</i>

23:40.462 --> 23:42.880
<i>Ain't misbehavin'</i>

23:42.881 --> 23:47.678
<i>I'm savin' my love for you</i>

23:48.262 --> 23:49.263
Yeah.

25:24.483 --> 25:29.738
Next on the BBC, over to Victor Smythe
who is waiting to introduce the show.

25:31.657 --> 25:33.366
Right you are, ladies and gentlemen.

25:33.367 --> 25:35.618
We are ready to go live to the nation

25:35.619 --> 25:40.666
in five, four, three, two, one.

26:16.577 --> 26:21.873
Well, that was the Work's Brass Band
under its conductor, William Laughton,

26:21.874 --> 26:24.083
playing "Trumpeter Bob."

26:24.084 --> 26:26.544
- Do I look all right?
- It opens our contribution...

26:26.545 --> 26:29.172
- You look lovely.
- ...to Works Wonders from this factory

26:29.173 --> 26:32.508
here in the Southeast of the country.

26:32.509 --> 26:36.095
As you know, we travel
the length and breadth of Britain

26:36.096 --> 26:38.306
looking for factory workers with talent

26:38.307 --> 26:41.142
<i>to help cheer up the nation.</i>

26:41.143 --> 26:46.648
<i>Today we feature munitions worker,
Miss... Miss Rita Hanway.</i>

26:50.068 --> 26:53.362
Go on, Rita! Go on, girl! Give it some!

26:53.363 --> 26:54.489
Keep it down.

27:03.749 --> 27:07.836
This is for all the parents
whose children have been evacuated,

27:08.545 --> 27:11.006
and for my boy, George.

27:12.424 --> 27:13.800
Here we go.

27:19.598 --> 27:20.681
<i>Turn</i>

27:20.682 --> 27:21.892
Sorry.

27:25.979 --> 27:27.314
Can you do it again?

27:28.232 --> 27:29.399
All right.

27:32.486 --> 27:34.362
<i>Turn up my collar</i>

27:34.363 --> 27:36.030
<i>Whatever the weather</i>

27:36.031 --> 27:40.117
<i>You'll be with me</i>

27:40.118 --> 27:43.663
<i>Wherever I go, we'll be together</i>

27:43.664 --> 27:47.458
<i>Just you and me</i>

27:47.459 --> 27:51.796
<i>I wrap myself in warm, sunny you</i>

27:51.797 --> 27:54.590
<i>Not to feel blue</i>

27:54.591 --> 28:00.639
<i>My winter coat is you</i>

28:03.433 --> 28:06.853
<i>Outside might be dark and gray</i>

28:06.854 --> 28:09.897
<i>In my heart, it's a sunny day</i>

28:09.898 --> 28:16.779
<i>Rays of spring will soon arrive
Blooming in your smiling eyes</i>

28:16.780 --> 28:23.202
<i>Nothing ever brings me down
'Cause I feel you all around</i>

28:23.203 --> 28:26.622
<i>Rain or shine, sleet or snow</i>

28:26.623 --> 28:32.086
<i>You're the shelter I call home</i>

28:32.087 --> 28:36.007
<i>Turn up my collar
Hands in my pockets</i>

28:36.008 --> 28:39.802
<i>You'll be with me</i>

28:39.803 --> 28:46.643
<i>Wherever I go, we'll be together
From sea to sea</i>

28:47.352 --> 28:53.774
<i>I wrap myself in warm, sunny you
Not to feel blue</i>

28:53.775 --> 28:59.198
<i>My winter coat is you</i>

29:00.115 --> 29:05.495
<i>My winter coat is you</i>

29:06.955 --> 29:13.962
<i>My winter coat is you</i>

29:23.555 --> 29:24.555
Thank you.

29:24.556 --> 29:34.732
We need shelters! Open up the Underground!

29:34.733 --> 29:35.816
Sorry.

29:35.817 --> 29:40.321
We need shelters! Open up the Underground!

29:40.322 --> 29:44.326
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
we head back to Broadcasting House.

29:44.952 --> 29:45.953
Thank you.

29:47.621 --> 29:49.121
<i>We need shelters!</i>

29:49.122 --> 29:51.124
Open up the Underground!

31:46.573 --> 31:49.201
Just do it. Just speak to him.

31:51.954 --> 31:55.415
Hey, I'm Tommy. What's your name?

31:57.084 --> 31:58.085
George.

31:58.836 --> 32:03.298
Georgie Porgie, puddin' and pie.
Kissed the girls and made 'em cry.

32:05.050 --> 32:07.718
Little Tommy Tucker sang for his supper.

32:07.719 --> 32:10.681
What shall we give him?
Brown bread and butter.

32:13.433 --> 32:14.476
All right.

32:15.853 --> 32:18.272
These are my brothers, Archie and Ian.

32:19.273 --> 32:20.691
Do you want to see my beetle?

32:25.654 --> 32:26.655
Do you wanna hold it?

32:29.616 --> 32:30.784
Its name's Gerry.

32:35.497 --> 32:38.583
When we got to Somerset,
they were gonna separate us.

32:38.584 --> 32:40.668
That wasn't gonna happen.

32:40.669 --> 32:43.504
In our family, it's one for all,
all for one.

32:43.505 --> 32:47.216
So we ran for it,
hid in the woods and jumped on this train.

32:47.217 --> 32:50.261
Tommy, I'm hungry.

32:50.262 --> 32:51.637
Stop whining.

32:51.638 --> 32:53.140
I've got a sandwich.

32:58.437 --> 32:59.521
We can share it.

33:09.990 --> 33:12.534
Strawberry jam! My favorite.

33:13.327 --> 33:15.077
How'd you get away?

33:15.078 --> 33:16.537
I jumped off the train.

33:16.538 --> 33:17.748
Jeepers!

33:18.498 --> 33:20.166
My mum sent me away.

33:20.167 --> 33:22.793
At the station, I was a bit mean to her.

33:22.794 --> 33:26.632
She's your mum. She'll forgive ya.
They always do.

33:27.674 --> 33:29.384
I just want to go home.

33:30.302 --> 33:32.845
Do you know what happens
if we get caught, George?

33:32.846 --> 33:36.015
They march you to the nearest station
and stick you on the next train.

33:36.016 --> 33:38.768
And then they gag you
and tie you to the seat with straps,

33:38.769 --> 33:41.896
and hang a sign around your neck
that says "Dangerous Escapee"

33:41.897 --> 33:43.523
so you can't escape again.

33:43.524 --> 33:45.567
What happens if you wanna go to the bog?

33:46.568 --> 33:48.570
Maybe they give you a nappy or something.

33:53.325 --> 33:54.659
Let's play dares.

33:54.660 --> 33:55.785
All right.

33:55.786 --> 34:00.123
I dare you to climb
onto the roof of the train.

34:01.250 --> 34:02.251
Easy.

34:03.919 --> 34:05.379
Go on then.

34:26.608 --> 34:28.527
Come on. Give us a hand then.

34:32.781 --> 34:33.991
It's all right.

34:42.583 --> 34:43.667
Here you are.

35:13.989 --> 35:15.866
Climb up on them boxes!

35:32.424 --> 35:36.803
Yeah!

35:38.931 --> 35:41.308
London, here we come!

36:20.556 --> 36:22.474
London! Wake up!

36:30.440 --> 36:32.860
We've stopped but we're not at a station.

36:34.987 --> 36:36.822
- Clear!
- Also clear!

36:39.491 --> 36:42.452
No. This way. Come on, quick.

36:43.245 --> 36:44.705
Clear!

36:46.331 --> 36:47.541
Now!

36:48.834 --> 36:50.710
- Come here, you.
- Get off!

36:50.711 --> 36:53.337
- Get off me, you scallywag.
- Let go of my brother!

36:53.338 --> 36:54.797
- Run!
- Leg it, George!

36:54.798 --> 36:56.007
- Tommy!
- Get off me!

36:56.008 --> 36:59.093
Bill! Over here!

36:59.094 --> 37:00.469
Faster!

37:00.470 --> 37:01.929
- Come on, Tommy!
- Bill!

37:01.930 --> 37:03.222
Boss!

37:03.223 --> 37:04.308
Come on, George!

37:05.100 --> 37:06.184
Come back here!

37:06.185 --> 37:08.728
- Try and catch us!
- Run!

37:08.729 --> 37:12.524
- Stop! Come back!
- Come catch us!

37:14.067 --> 37:15.986
Stop there!

37:19.698 --> 37:20.699
Come on, George!

37:21.617 --> 37:23.201
Get off the track!

37:23.202 --> 37:25.120
What's stopping ya? You can make it.

37:25.746 --> 37:27.331
Tommy!

37:35.088 --> 37:37.674
- Tommy!
- Get back here!

37:38.634 --> 37:40.802
- Tommy!
- Tommy!

38:11.959 --> 38:13.084
How did you let that happen?

38:13.085 --> 38:15.711
- It's disorderly and unacceptable.
- It's a disgrace.

38:15.712 --> 38:17.839
Don't you have control over your staff?
We're at war, man!

38:17.840 --> 38:19.590
I'm terribly sorry.
This should never have happened.

38:19.591 --> 38:22.677
- Those responsible will be disciplined.
- I hope so and you'll be darn lucky

38:22.678 --> 38:24.429
if we ever come to
this sorry factory again.

38:29.017 --> 38:30.185
You.

38:32.187 --> 38:34.523
You! Get your things and come with me.

38:35.524 --> 38:36.817
And you lot and all.

38:39.111 --> 38:40.946
Come on. Let's go.

38:42.698 --> 38:44.408
Keep it going, girls.

38:56.420 --> 38:58.713
All Agnes and the girls were doing
was telling the truth.

38:58.714 --> 39:01.132
Well, see where that gets ya.
Out on their ears.

39:01.133 --> 39:03.176
Should have kept their mouths shut
and kept their jobs.

39:03.177 --> 39:06.596
- Blimey, Doris.
- Someone has to speak up, don't they?

39:06.597 --> 39:08.724
- That was lovely, Rita.
- Really?

39:09.349 --> 39:10.683
Felt a bit shaky at the beginning.

39:10.684 --> 39:12.603
No, I thought you sounded lovely.

39:16.607 --> 39:18.566
- Good night, girls.
- Good night.

39:18.567 --> 39:19.860
Right, you ready?

39:34.791 --> 39:36.502
Come on!

40:36.562 --> 40:39.606
Come on! Yeah!

40:57.958 --> 40:59.543
Come on!

41:20.606 --> 41:22.900
Come on. Yes, sir! Come on, now!

42:03.732 --> 42:05.359
My mother gave it to me...

42:07.528 --> 42:08.529
and now

42:10.364 --> 42:11.949
I'm giving it to you.

42:13.659 --> 42:15.369
It will keep you safe.

42:33.428 --> 42:36.305
<i>All by myself</i>

42:36.306 --> 42:39.100
<i>No one to walk with</i>

42:39.101 --> 42:43.604
<i>But I'm happy on the shelf</i>

42:43.605 --> 42:46.482
<i>Ain't misbehavin'</i>

42:46.483 --> 42:49.695
<i>I'm savin' my love for you</i>

42:50.279 --> 42:51.487
Oy, watch it.

42:51.488 --> 42:52.864
- Come on.
- What'd you say?

42:52.865 --> 42:54.657
I said, "Watch it."
You did that on purpose.

42:54.658 --> 42:55.741
Come on. Take no notice.

42:55.742 --> 42:58.536
What kind of man are you,
what needs a woman to defend him?

42:58.537 --> 43:00.246
What are you doing with that monkey?

43:00.247 --> 43:02.082
Hey. Watch your mouth.

43:04.585 --> 43:06.043
Marcus!

43:06.044 --> 43:07.128
Stay out of it.

43:07.129 --> 43:08.589
- Get off him!
- Come here.

43:10.424 --> 43:11.758
Get off me!

43:12.801 --> 43:13.677
Fucking have him.

43:14.845 --> 43:16.137
Marcus!

43:16.138 --> 43:17.680
- What's going on?
- Get off of him!

43:17.681 --> 43:18.764
- It's the Old Bill.
- Get off!

43:18.765 --> 43:20.808
Officer! He's a savage!

43:20.809 --> 43:24.937
- He tried to attack me, Officer!
- No! He's lying. They started the fight!

43:24.938 --> 43:27.106
He came at us
like an animal for no good reason.

43:27.107 --> 43:29.483
- All right. You're coming with us.
- Yeah, too right.

43:29.484 --> 43:31.485
He should be locked up.
That sort is always a menace.

43:31.486 --> 43:33.654
They threw the first punch.
I was defending myself.

43:33.655 --> 43:36.824
Well, you'll have a bit more defending
to do when we get you down to the station.

43:36.825 --> 43:39.118
- He hasn't done anything! Marcus!
- Oh, God! Rita!

43:39.119 --> 43:41.370
- Get back!
- Rita!

43:41.371 --> 43:43.373
I said, "Don't move."

43:46.293 --> 43:47.294
Stay there.

43:53.717 --> 43:55.010
Marcus.

44:13.070 --> 44:14.446
Tickets please.

44:17.449 --> 44:18.950
You got a ticket, young man?

44:18.951 --> 44:20.869
Next stop, Piccadilly Circus!

44:28.752 --> 44:31.254
Am I on the right bus to Stepney?

44:31.255 --> 44:33.381
Well, you are and you're not.

44:33.382 --> 44:35.508
What you gotta do,
get off at the next stop,

44:35.509 --> 44:36.634
cross over the road,

44:36.635 --> 44:39.136
get the 14, go three stops back
where you come from.

44:39.137 --> 44:42.557
And what you do, you get off that bus,
take a right, take a left,

44:42.558 --> 44:43.975
cross over the road,

44:43.976 --> 44:46.894
you'll see the bus stop
for the 64 heading to Liverpool Street.

44:46.895 --> 44:49.063
But you want
the one heading to Whitechapel.

44:49.064 --> 44:50.440
And then it's five stops.

45:27.102 --> 45:29.979
Get along with you, lad.
Loitering is not permitted.

45:29.980 --> 45:31.773
Go on. Scat.

47:18.172 --> 47:19.464
What is your name?

47:24.178 --> 47:25.179
Come with me.

47:58.754 --> 48:00.713
Oh, for goodness' sake. Keep still.

48:00.714 --> 48:02.132
It tickles.

48:09.515 --> 48:10.682
All right, I'm done.

48:12.309 --> 48:14.101
You ain't gone nearly high enough.

48:14.102 --> 48:16.562
So what?
No one's gonna be looking up there.

48:16.563 --> 48:20.233
Well, then I must have higher hopes
for this evening than you do.

48:20.234 --> 48:24.070
What about Dave? He's overseas.

48:24.071 --> 48:26.198
What he don't know,
it ain't gonna hurt him.

48:27.824 --> 48:29.284
Right. You see where my finger is?

48:30.160 --> 48:31.912
I want you to go all the way up to there.

48:33.205 --> 48:35.290
You got a view of a lifetime
down there, Doris.

48:35.958 --> 48:37.209
Yeah, it's lovely.

48:38.669 --> 48:40.838
For goodness' sake. Keep still.

48:43.590 --> 48:45.925
Do you know,
you've got a lovely soft touch, Doris.

48:45.926 --> 48:47.927
Been told. Thank you.

48:47.928 --> 48:49.388
She's ever so gentle.

48:51.431 --> 48:52.432
Happy?

48:53.016 --> 48:54.434
That's better.

48:55.269 --> 48:58.312
See, now don't you look nice
when you let us at you, eh?

48:58.313 --> 48:59.814
Well, I'm really not in the mood.

48:59.815 --> 49:01.983
Well, that's nothing
that a drink or two won't cure.

49:01.984 --> 49:04.945
And I gave you the last of my lippy,
so don't make me regret that.

49:06.446 --> 49:08.657
Come on. Let's get down there
before all the good ones are gone.

49:09.241 --> 49:10.284
What's left of them.

49:35.142 --> 49:36.560
Hello, sailor.

49:40.647 --> 49:41.564
He'd do.

49:41.565 --> 49:43.608
You've got a one-track mind, you have.

49:43.609 --> 49:45.318
He's got a friend, look. Are you coming?

49:45.319 --> 49:46.820
No, I'm bloody not.

49:48.655 --> 49:49.864
Hey.

49:49.865 --> 49:52.075
Come on, Jackie boy.

49:53.535 --> 49:56.329
- Same again?
- I'm all right. I think I'm gonna leave.

49:56.330 --> 49:59.415
Might go over to help
that Mickey Davies at that shelter.

49:59.416 --> 50:01.335
What? Little Mickey?

50:01.919 --> 50:05.087
Well, you know what they say.
Height can have its advantages.

50:05.088 --> 50:08.926
You and your one-track mind.
Can't you just shut it for even a minute?

50:09.968 --> 50:11.010
Sorry.

50:11.011 --> 50:12.637
She can't bloody help herself.

50:12.638 --> 50:13.847
What can I get you?

50:14.598 --> 50:15.599
Same again, my love.

50:17.434 --> 50:18.852
What's your name, love?

50:19.561 --> 50:21.437
Tilda with a T.

50:21.438 --> 50:23.439
What's your poison, Tilda with a T?

50:23.440 --> 50:24.524
We've all got jobs now.

50:24.525 --> 50:26.692
We can buy our own drinks,
thanks very much.

50:26.693 --> 50:27.860
Oh, come on, love.

50:27.861 --> 50:31.990
We're gentlemen of the old school,
where chivalry is alive and kicking.

50:32.574 --> 50:34.825
Let us treat you and your friends.

50:34.826 --> 50:36.578
All right then, if you insist.

50:38.497 --> 50:39.830
Here we go.

50:39.831 --> 50:41.123
Have a look who I found, ladies.

50:41.124 --> 50:43.877
- Evening, ladies.
- Hello.

50:45.003 --> 50:47.672
- Cheers. Thank you.
- That's all right.

50:47.673 --> 50:49.340
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

50:49.341 --> 50:51.676
Looks like you missed
your chance again, Jackie boy.

50:51.677 --> 50:53.511
Yeah, but she's damaged goods, isn't she?

50:53.512 --> 50:55.972
She's got that little monkey
to look after.

50:55.973 --> 50:57.515
Right, on your feet, Campbell.

50:57.516 --> 50:58.641
- See you later.
- You what?

50:58.642 --> 51:00.476
Come on. Let's take this outside.

51:00.477 --> 51:01.562
Sit down, Jack.

51:02.271 --> 51:04.355
He's had too much
to drink. He's pissed, mate.

51:04.356 --> 51:07.734
Yeah, just having a laugh.
Keep your shirt on.

51:09.778 --> 51:11.779
Well, then don't make me think of
taking it off.

51:11.780 --> 51:12.864
All right.

51:12.865 --> 51:15.951
Sit down, behave yourself.
Saying silly things like that.

51:46.607 --> 51:47.983
What's your name?

51:48.692 --> 51:51.653
I asked you first. At the arcade.

51:52.571 --> 51:53.864
What is your name?

51:56.950 --> 51:58.493
- George.
- George.

51:59.494 --> 52:02.456
Pleasure to meet you, George.
My name is Ife.

52:04.208 --> 52:05.416
Ife?

52:05.417 --> 52:09.004
Yes. Ife is Nigerian for "love."

52:14.426 --> 52:15.552
George.

52:17.262 --> 52:18.388
Where do you live?

52:22.351 --> 52:25.102
Stepney. Clifford Lane.

52:25.103 --> 52:27.564
So how the hell did you end up here?

52:34.655 --> 52:37.532
I jumped off the train
'cause I wanna go home.

52:37.533 --> 52:38.867
I lost me way.

52:39.618 --> 52:41.370
Please don't send me back.

52:46.250 --> 52:47.376
Finish your tea.

52:48.001 --> 52:50.002
Then you can come with me on my rounds.

52:50.003 --> 52:52.588
Afterwards, I'll take you home
to Clifford Lane.

52:52.589 --> 52:54.299
How does that sound?

53:20.909 --> 53:22.869
- Ife?
- Yes, George.

53:22.870 --> 53:24.579
Where do you come from?

53:24.580 --> 53:26.164
My people are the Yoruba.

53:26.832 --> 53:28.625
But I grew up in the Gold Coast.

53:29.501 --> 53:30.878
Do you know where that is?

53:32.880 --> 53:34.089
It's in Africa.

53:34.631 --> 53:35.924
That's where lions are from.

53:37.259 --> 53:38.927
There are lions in some places.

53:39.469 --> 53:40.888
Not where I'm from though.

53:41.847 --> 53:44.433
What about crocodiles?

53:45.017 --> 53:46.767
There are crocodiles, yes.

53:46.768 --> 53:49.353
But what you really have to
look out for in the city

53:49.354 --> 53:52.524
are the buses
and the motorcycles and cars.

53:53.275 --> 53:55.068
They drive like mad people.

53:59.615 --> 54:00.990
Are you Black?

54:00.991 --> 54:02.242
Of course.

54:02.826 --> 54:04.035
I'm not Black.

54:04.036 --> 54:05.119
Are you not?

54:05.120 --> 54:06.495
No.

54:06.496 --> 54:10.334
My father was.
He was born in a place called Grenada.

54:10.918 --> 54:13.794
His name's Marcus, but I never met him.

54:13.795 --> 54:17.633
My mum said people took him away from us
before I was born.

54:18.258 --> 54:19.759
Why was that?

54:19.760 --> 54:20.844
I don't know.

54:21.678 --> 54:24.348
Me granddad says he was deported.

54:30.270 --> 54:31.687
I told my mum I hated her.

54:31.688 --> 54:33.065
Why did you say that?

54:33.815 --> 54:35.609
'Cause she made me go.

54:37.819 --> 54:40.030
She did it to keep you safe.

54:42.574 --> 54:43.659
I know.

55:12.020 --> 55:14.857
She was badly shaken
but back working the next day.

55:15.440 --> 55:19.944
Anyway, I just want to say, for all those
who have been dispossessed,

55:19.945 --> 55:23.406
made homeless due to the bombings,
there have to be rules put in place

55:23.407 --> 55:27.244
due to the squalid, unsanitary situation
I found on my arrival.

55:27.828 --> 55:30.289
Please use the buckets
which have now been provided.

55:30.956 --> 55:32.415
There will be other buckets going round

55:32.416 --> 55:35.168
for a collection
to help fund this facility.

55:35.169 --> 55:38.379
- Sorry.
- We're here for your well-being

55:38.380 --> 55:40.173
and to give all equal care,

55:40.174 --> 55:43.969
regardless of whoever you are
or wherever you come from.

55:44.803 --> 55:48.848
Like most of you here
I grew up in the East End as a Jew,

55:48.849 --> 55:51.934
and in my community, we helped each other.

55:51.935 --> 55:56.607
We joined together with good working-class
men and women to fight the fascists.

55:59.776 --> 56:01.277
Now I want to be clear.

56:01.278 --> 56:03.655
Some have called me a socialist...

56:04.740 --> 56:06.574
a communist,

56:06.575 --> 56:08.535
a danger to our society.

56:10.996 --> 56:15.082
But my ideals are more closely associated
with Christianity

56:15.083 --> 56:16.543
than with communism.

56:17.878 --> 56:20.964
"Do unto others
as you would have them do unto you."

56:22.132 --> 56:24.134
Maybe Jesus was a red.

56:30.015 --> 56:31.600
May God bless us all

56:32.518 --> 56:36.480
and our brave servicemen and women
that are fighting for our liberty.

56:38.065 --> 56:40.067
And thank you for your support.

56:41.235 --> 56:42.653
And don't mix up the buckets.

56:50.035 --> 56:53.038
Mickey! Mickey! Mickey! Mickey!

56:56.917 --> 56:58.418
Go on, Mickey!

57:15.394 --> 57:16.520
Just a moment.

57:18.230 --> 57:20.022
Make sure she takes it now.
She's in a bad way.

57:20.023 --> 57:21.275
Yes, Mickey.

57:26.822 --> 57:28.030
How can I help?

57:28.031 --> 57:30.367
I'm Rita Hanway. I'd like to volunteer.

57:30.993 --> 57:34.036
- You sure you've come to the right place?
- I can make beds, clean floors.

57:34.037 --> 57:35.539
I don't mind doing anything.

57:36.582 --> 57:37.832
How's your first aid?

57:37.833 --> 57:39.751
I did my training three months ago.

57:42.462 --> 57:43.839
Are you all right?

57:47.509 --> 57:51.305
I evacuated my son this morning.
So I'm really missing him.

57:59.730 --> 58:00.980
Hello, Betty.

58:00.981 --> 58:03.399
I've got a new friend of mine
I'd like you to meet.

58:03.400 --> 58:06.320
Her name's Rita.
She's gonna change your dressing.

58:08.864 --> 58:10.616
What happened to your arm, Betty?

58:12.034 --> 58:13.035
I don't know.

58:13.994 --> 58:15.454
I want my mum.

58:23.504 --> 58:24.546
Do you want a cuddle?

58:28.550 --> 58:30.427
Yeah? Come here.

58:34.014 --> 58:34.973
It's all right.

59:02.501 --> 59:03.502
Hello?

59:05.629 --> 59:08.173
Hello. Hello--

59:10.175 --> 59:11.259
Good evening, sir.

59:11.260 --> 59:13.595
It is blackout.
Please turn off your lights.

59:17.307 --> 59:19.059
Who's that at the door, Stan?

59:19.726 --> 59:20.853
No one, love.

59:35.576 --> 59:40.372
<i>Alleluia</i>

59:41.206 --> 59:45.544
<i>Alleluia</i>

59:46.503 --> 59:50.799
<i>Alleluia</i>

59:51.758 --> 59:55.887
<i>Alleluia</i>

59:55.888 --> 59:56.972
Sing with me.

59:57.639 --> 01:00:02.769
<i>Alleluia</i>

01:00:03.604 --> 01:00:08.358
<i>Alleluia</i>

01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:14.281
<i>Alleluia</i>

01:00:14.865 --> 01:00:18.911
<i>Alleluia</i>

01:00:24.666 --> 01:00:26.168
Come on, George.

01:00:48.815 --> 01:00:50.859
I'm moving to the next stop!

01:00:53.779 --> 01:00:57.323
ARP warden, coming through!
Make a pathway to let them through!

01:00:57.324 --> 01:00:59.742
Come on, George! Stay close!

01:00:59.743 --> 01:01:02.246
- Stop pushing!
- ARP coming through.

01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:04.830
- Ife!
- Let the boy through.

01:01:04.831 --> 01:01:06.208
Stand aside for him.

01:01:20.931 --> 01:01:22.015
Evening.

01:01:37.614 --> 01:01:38.949
I need to pee.

01:01:39.533 --> 01:01:40.617
This way.

01:01:45.581 --> 01:01:46.957
Behind those curtains.

01:01:59.553 --> 01:02:01.555
Excuse me. What are you doing?

01:02:02.347 --> 01:02:04.432
If you don't move,
there's gonna be trouble.

01:02:04.433 --> 01:02:06.684
This is for English people. Move over.

01:02:06.685 --> 01:02:08.979
- But, madam, we are--
- Don't raise your voice at my wife.

01:02:09.563 --> 01:02:11.480
Who do you think you are? Just move over.

01:02:11.481 --> 01:02:13.232
Sir, he wasn't raising his voice.

01:02:13.233 --> 01:02:15.569
And I definitely wasn't talking
to you lot, mate.

01:02:16.278 --> 01:02:19.947
So you better shut up and sit down
or I'll give you what for.

01:02:19.948 --> 01:02:21.992
What seems to be the problem here?

01:02:24.161 --> 01:02:26.829
This gentleman has put up
this sheet to contain us.

01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:29.332
To put us in a prison within a prison.

01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:32.586
I have no interest in looking at him,
but I do not want to be concealed.

01:02:33.795 --> 01:02:35.339
Hey, what are you--

01:02:43.388 --> 01:02:44.389
Sir.

01:02:45.724 --> 01:02:47.142
There is no segregation here.

01:02:47.768 --> 01:02:52.648
We are all equal members
of this country, willing or not.

01:02:53.273 --> 01:02:57.401
This is exactly what Hitler is doing.

01:02:57.402 --> 01:02:59.738
Dividing man against man
and race against race.

01:03:00.322 --> 01:03:02.074
We are in a situation of war,

01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:05.993
banded together,
asked to do our absolute best.

01:03:05.994 --> 01:03:07.329
And I'd like to think...

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.331
I'd like to think
that we step up to the occasion

01:03:10.332 --> 01:03:13.085
and see our fellow human beings as equals

01:03:13.752 --> 01:03:16.338
and that we treat each other
with compassion...

01:03:18.465 --> 01:03:19.466
and respect.

01:03:25.931 --> 01:03:30.102
I would advise those who do not agree
to seek shelter elsewhere.

01:03:37.818 --> 01:03:39.152
George. Come.

01:03:55.502 --> 01:03:57.462
George. Get some sleep.

01:03:58.714 --> 01:04:01.341
I'm still on duty.
I've got to finish my rounds.

01:04:02.509 --> 01:04:04.094
I'll be back in the morning.

01:04:10.475 --> 01:04:11.476
Ife?

01:04:17.065 --> 01:04:18.066
Yes, George.

01:04:20.569 --> 01:04:21.904
I am Black.

01:04:35.417 --> 01:04:37.210
I'll be back in a few hours.

01:04:37.211 --> 01:04:39.796
And I'll teach you another song
when I take you home.

01:04:47.471 --> 01:04:50.516
Lights out!

01:05:07.824 --> 01:05:09.076
Lights out!

01:05:13.622 --> 01:05:15.123
Do you remember what it was?

01:05:22.047 --> 01:05:25.133
That's a G. That's a G chord.

01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:29.304
And then you go down.

01:05:30.347 --> 01:05:31.723
That's F.

01:05:32.641 --> 01:05:35.143
There you are, there. Play them.

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:39.606
What was the one
you guys were playing the other day?

01:05:45.279 --> 01:05:49.116
Fun, right? Mummy's fun!

01:05:49.992 --> 01:05:52.910
Yeah, she is. She's really fun.

01:05:52.911 --> 01:05:56.123
<i>Mum, Mum
Looks like a plum!</i>

01:05:57.249 --> 01:05:58.250
What?

01:06:00.419 --> 01:06:02.170
I look like a plum?

01:06:02.171 --> 01:06:04.547
- It's true.
- But that's mean.

01:06:04.548 --> 01:06:05.631
I like plums.

01:06:05.632 --> 01:06:10.846
<i>George He's really gorgeous</i>

01:06:20.647 --> 01:06:21.982
All clear!

01:06:24.276 --> 01:06:25.611
All clear!

01:06:29.406 --> 01:06:32.951
Make your way safely upstairs,
ladies and gentlemen!

01:06:34.745 --> 01:06:36.622
Excuse me, sir. Have you seen Ife?

01:06:37.331 --> 01:06:38.373
Ife.

01:06:39.791 --> 01:06:42.419
Yes. Wait here, lad.

01:06:43.337 --> 01:06:46.590
Come here.

01:06:47.424 --> 01:06:50.219
- Quick, over there. Hide.
- Quick. Come.

01:06:54.056 --> 01:06:56.934
Here, Bill. Boy's asking for Ife.

01:06:57.726 --> 01:06:59.810
Didn't you hear? He got it last night.

01:06:59.811 --> 01:07:01.354
What?

01:07:01.355 --> 01:07:05.149
He was trying to get this old girl
out of her house. She refused to leave.

01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:07.027
Didn't think twice about himself.

01:07:07.903 --> 01:07:08.987
Bloody hell.

01:07:11.114 --> 01:07:12.824
Right, then.
We've got to see about that boy.

01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:15.160
Come on, I'll start over here.

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:21.041
Where's he going?

01:07:21.792 --> 01:07:24.211
- Watch it!
- You mind where you're going!

01:08:06.086 --> 01:08:07.421
Throw one at him.

01:08:09.715 --> 01:08:12.258
Get out of it!
You'll feel the back of my hand!

01:08:12.259 --> 01:08:15.428
Your mother's gonna hear about this!
I know where you live!

01:08:15.429 --> 01:08:16.680
Go on!

01:08:43.372 --> 01:08:44.582
Rita!

01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:57.179
Rita, you all right?

01:08:58.388 --> 01:08:59.640
That was close.

01:09:00.724 --> 01:09:02.893
Right. Let's get this cleared up then.

01:09:11.859 --> 01:09:14.195
Calling Rita Hanway.

01:09:14.196 --> 01:09:16.322
<i>Calling Rita Hanway.</i>

01:09:16.323 --> 01:09:18.825
<i>Will you make your way
to the office please?</i>

01:09:35.050 --> 01:09:36.218
Take a seat, Rita.

01:09:43.559 --> 01:09:44.643
What's all this about?

01:09:45.185 --> 01:09:49.647
Mrs. Hanway, I'm Timothy Ashdown
and this is my colleague Brenda Watson.

01:09:49.648 --> 01:09:52.234
We're from
the Education Officer's Department.

01:09:53.569 --> 01:09:56.612
I'm sorry to say, it's been brought
to our attention that your son,

01:09:56.613 --> 01:10:00.825
George Hanway,
did not arrive at his destination.

01:10:00.826 --> 01:10:04.996
We found out that about an hour or so
into the journey, he absconded.

01:10:04.997 --> 01:10:09.959
A child who befriended him told us
that he jumped from the train.

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.043
He jumped?

01:10:11.044 --> 01:10:12.962
He got to his feet
and waved to his friend.

01:10:12.963 --> 01:10:15.465
- He didn't appear to be injured.
- He was placed in your care.

01:10:16.008 --> 01:10:18.509
- You're responsible for his safety.
- Now, this must be a shock, Rita,

01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:21.679
- but please contain yourself--
- No. Where is he? Where's my boy?

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.014
Why can't you tell me where he is?

01:10:23.015 --> 01:10:26.225
All the relevant authorities
have been informed, including the police.

01:10:26.226 --> 01:10:28.060
You were meant to be looking after him.

01:10:28.061 --> 01:10:29.979
All the protocols were followed

01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:31.814
- in accordance with the law.
- All the protocols?

01:10:31.815 --> 01:10:35.276
Where's my bleedin' son?
I left him in your care yesterday morning.

01:10:35.277 --> 01:10:37.904
Here are our details, Mrs. Hanway.

01:10:37.905 --> 01:10:40.740
If he finds his way home,
please let us know.

01:10:40.741 --> 01:10:42.742
Rita!

01:10:42.743 --> 01:10:44.869
I know you're upset, that's understandable
given the circumstances...

01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:47.079
- Really.
- ...but you're in the middle of a shift.

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:48.957
I'll be back when I've found my boy.

01:10:49.708 --> 01:10:51.792
There might not be a job for you here!

01:10:51.793 --> 01:10:55.004
You can shove your job
up your jacksie for all I care!

01:10:55.005 --> 01:10:58.509
All right. God. Rita!

01:10:59.426 --> 01:11:01.219
- Hey!
- Rita!

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:03.137
- Get back here!
- Rita, what's happened?

01:11:03.138 --> 01:11:04.764
- Rita, what's happened?
- Rita!

01:11:04.765 --> 01:11:06.183
- Rita!
- Get out the way.

01:11:11.647 --> 01:11:12.648
Get back to work.

01:11:27.287 --> 01:11:30.164
We're getting by at the moment.
There's still some sugar about,

01:11:30.165 --> 01:11:32.291
but I don't know what's gonna happen
with these rations.

01:11:32.292 --> 01:11:33.877
Oy!

01:11:37.631 --> 01:11:40.299
Should get rid of the lot of them.
Bloody scallywags.

01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:42.093
Well, it takes one to know one.

01:11:42.094 --> 01:11:43.554
How dare you.

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.306
- Terrible.
- Oh, piss off.

01:11:49.184 --> 01:11:50.185
Hey!

01:11:52.479 --> 01:11:53.814
What, you're hungry?

01:11:58.443 --> 01:12:00.696
Uh-uh! Hold your horses, boy.

01:12:02.197 --> 01:12:04.032
When did you last have something to eat?

01:12:07.911 --> 01:12:08.912
Come on.

01:12:11.707 --> 01:12:14.585
Let's go get you a glass of milk
and a sandwich and you can be on your way.

01:12:15.252 --> 01:12:16.336
I'm Jess.

01:12:17.004 --> 01:12:18.005
You?

01:12:20.132 --> 01:12:21.341
What's your name?

01:12:23.302 --> 01:12:25.721
Well, no name, no sandwich. Your choice.

01:12:27.472 --> 01:12:28.764
George.

01:12:28.765 --> 01:12:30.184
Nice to meet you, George.

01:12:31.435 --> 01:12:33.395
Can I have a sausage sandwich?

01:12:33.937 --> 01:12:35.147
Don't see why not.

01:12:36.315 --> 01:12:39.442
"Fruit soon ripe
<i>Fi tek wi bite</i>

01:12:39.443 --> 01:12:42.403

01:12:42.404 --> 01:12:43.655

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:46.700

01:12:51.455 --> 01:12:53.624
Oh, here are. He looks small enough.

01:13:02.633 --> 01:13:05.219
Done good, Jess. What's his name?

01:13:07.095 --> 01:13:07.930
George.

01:13:08.555 --> 01:13:11.808
Come here, boy.
Let me take a proper look at you.

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:25.864
Where you from?

01:13:27.282 --> 01:13:29.660
Albert asked you a question, George.

01:13:32.371 --> 01:13:34.831
Stepney. Clifford Lane.

01:13:35.874 --> 01:13:37.042
Shithole.

01:13:39.378 --> 01:13:40.504
Right.

01:13:41.463 --> 01:13:43.090
Let's get you to work, boy.

01:13:52.307 --> 01:13:53.684
Got that, Harve?

01:14:00.107 --> 01:14:03.068
<i>Evening Standard</i>. <i>Standard.</i>

01:14:05.279 --> 01:14:07.489
- Piss off.
- Ta, Albert.

01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:11.702
There's a hole behind there.

01:14:12.327 --> 01:14:16.163
What I need you to do is to make yourself
as small as possible and crawl through.

01:14:16.164 --> 01:14:18.291
Yeah? Take as much as you can.

01:14:18.292 --> 01:14:19.459
Understand?

01:14:21.503 --> 01:14:22.421
Oy.

01:14:31.305 --> 01:14:33.890
You try that again
and I'll personally thrash ya

01:14:33.891 --> 01:14:35.350
till you're black and blue.

01:14:35.893 --> 01:14:39.770
And after that, if you're still breathing,
we'll throw you in the river

01:14:39.771 --> 01:14:43.233
and no one will find you, dead or alive.

01:14:44.401 --> 01:14:47.237
Take this. Get in there.

01:14:50.866 --> 01:14:54.493
<i>Evening Standard</i>!
Get your <i>Evening Standard</i>!

01:14:54.494 --> 01:14:56.245
We're such hard down, are we?

01:14:56.246 --> 01:14:57.748
Stupid kids.

01:15:28.278 --> 01:15:30.696
Course I don't. What, by looking at it?

01:15:30.697 --> 01:15:32.616
I'm opening it one way or another.

01:15:34.409 --> 01:15:36.078
Can't we do it afterwards?

01:15:55.806 --> 01:15:56.806
Anybody home?

01:15:56.807 --> 01:15:59.810
Hey, you'll bring
the whole place down on us.

01:16:00.435 --> 01:16:02.312
That's gonna take some retuning.

01:16:07.651 --> 01:16:08.652
Jim.

01:16:09.403 --> 01:16:10.654
Have a look at this.

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:17.911
Any scallywag off the street
could come in here and help himself.

01:16:18.662 --> 01:16:19.913
Here, give us an hand.

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.046
That'll do for now.

01:16:28.922 --> 01:16:31.758
Leave it to the Old Bill to sort.
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:16:34.303 --> 01:16:35.470
Gorblimey.

01:16:40.475 --> 01:16:41.476
Jim.

01:16:44.021 --> 01:16:45.480
There's someone in here.

01:17:07.294 --> 01:17:10.047
- I don't like this. Let's go!
- Wait a minute!

01:17:24.728 --> 01:17:26.980
Yeah, too right. Let's go.

01:17:49.336 --> 01:17:52.213
- Why did he jump?
- I don't know, Dad. No one knows.

01:17:52.214 --> 01:17:54.841
- Where are you going, love?
- I'm going to find George.

01:17:54.842 --> 01:17:56.843
I can't stay here, twiddling my thumbs.

01:17:56.844 --> 01:17:58.427
- I'll come with ya.
- No.

01:17:58.428 --> 01:18:00.639
What if he comes home
and there's nobody here?

01:18:02.224 --> 01:18:03.392
Stay there.

01:18:07.729 --> 01:18:09.773
- Is Jack here?
- He's round there.

01:18:26.039 --> 01:18:27.124
Blimey.

01:18:30.294 --> 01:18:32.629
Yeah, you done good, George.

01:18:33.547 --> 01:18:35.215
Can you take me home now?

01:18:37.885 --> 01:18:40.512
Yeah, all in good time.

01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:42.931
No, now!

01:18:45.267 --> 01:18:46.392
What, did that hurt?

01:18:46.393 --> 01:18:49.688
Did that hurt? Did it? Like that?

01:18:50.522 --> 01:18:52.148
Did that hurt?

01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:54.108
- <i>Albert</i>
- Did that hurt?

01:18:54.109 --> 01:18:56.527
- Did it? Did it hurt?
- <i>Albert</i>

01:18:56.528 --> 01:18:59.198

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.201
<i>Albert</i>

01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:04.827
Sorry.

01:19:04.828 --> 01:19:07.623
- You here?
- Yeah.

01:19:09.625 --> 01:19:12.794
Yeah, you deserve a reward, eh?

01:19:13.754 --> 01:19:16.089
How about a bit of cake?

01:19:16.632 --> 01:19:18.550
Would you like a bit of cake? Yeah?

01:19:19.134 --> 01:19:21.094
Get him some cake. Yeah?

01:19:25.807 --> 01:19:29.102
Keep hold of him.
He's a slippery little tyke.

01:19:29.770 --> 01:19:31.605
Yeah?

01:19:36.235 --> 01:19:37.277
Come on.

01:19:38.987 --> 01:19:41.072
- Cup of tea, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:19:41.073 --> 01:19:43.158
You've had a turn again, ain't ya?

01:19:48.038 --> 01:19:49.081
Excuse me?

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.877
Her nine-year-old boy,
name of George Hanway,

01:19:54.878 --> 01:19:57.631
was evacuated
from this station yesterday morning.

01:19:58.674 --> 01:20:02.261
He was on the 10:45, but jumped off
about an hour after the train left.

01:20:02.845 --> 01:20:05.721
He ain't returned home. Have you...
Yeah, have you seen him?

01:20:05.722 --> 01:20:07.515
He's missing.

01:20:07.516 --> 01:20:10.143
This is lost property. Not lost children.

01:20:12.062 --> 01:20:14.773
We were just seeing
if you've heard or seen anything.

01:20:15.983 --> 01:20:17.359
Not me, mate.

01:20:21.113 --> 01:20:22.114
You have a nice evening.

01:20:27.035 --> 01:20:30.121
Excuse me, my boy, he's missing.
George Hanway.

01:20:30.122 --> 01:20:31.373
Look at the list.

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:37.629
Oy, that'll be it till later!

01:20:38.964 --> 01:20:39.965
Come here.

01:20:42.134 --> 01:20:43.759
- Ta, mate.
- That's all right.

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.178
Stop it!

01:20:45.179 --> 01:20:46.470
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:20:46.471 --> 01:20:49.223
Okay. So the word is out.

01:20:49.224 --> 01:20:52.310
People know about George,
but there's been no sighting of him, so...

01:20:52.311 --> 01:20:55.521
- I can't be there to protect him.
- Listen, he's a scrapper, Rita.

01:20:55.522 --> 01:20:57.524
He knows how to take care
of himself, doesn't he?

01:20:58.233 --> 01:20:59.734
He told me he hated me.

01:20:59.735 --> 01:21:02.321
I suppose I would have said
the same thing if I were him.

01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:07.784
I mean, you...
I would have wanted to stay with ya.

01:21:08.785 --> 01:21:09.995
I mean, you're his mum.

01:21:12.164 --> 01:21:14.917
- This way.
- No, this way. Let's go to Mickey's.

01:22:02.673 --> 01:22:04.007
Hello, ducky.

01:22:12.891 --> 01:22:14.852
Horns! Stand up please.

01:22:16.645 --> 01:22:18.105
Pardon my French.

01:23:24.171 --> 01:23:25.964
These orders are backing up!

01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:32.345
- Keep it moving!
- Let's go!

01:23:32.346 --> 01:23:33.513
Yes, chef!

01:23:33.514 --> 01:23:35.224
Let's go.

01:23:50.405 --> 01:23:52.198
It's a wonderful ring, darling.

01:23:52.199 --> 01:23:55.535
It could be probably eight or nine
or something like that.

01:23:55.536 --> 01:23:57.537
- Show me.
- I said it was seven carats,

01:23:57.538 --> 01:23:58.663
not eight or nine.

01:23:58.664 --> 01:24:00.998
- Excuse me, can you take this one away?
- Congratulations.

01:24:00.999 --> 01:24:02.291
Thank you so much.

01:24:02.292 --> 01:24:03.752
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:25:31.256 --> 01:25:33.509
- What you doing?
- It's not coming off.

01:25:35.844 --> 01:25:37.054
Give it here.

01:25:48.982 --> 01:25:50.150
Oy.

01:25:51.151 --> 01:25:52.611
Stop your gawping.

01:25:53.695 --> 01:25:56.197
If you wanna go home, get to work.

01:25:56.198 --> 01:25:59.242
Unless you want those uniforms
to put you back on that train.

01:25:59.243 --> 01:26:00.911
'Cause that's what they'll do.

01:26:02.704 --> 01:26:03.956
Come on, get on with it.

01:27:03.348 --> 01:27:04.725
Help me.

01:27:07.144 --> 01:27:09.438
Don't worry about it, they're all dead.

01:27:10.355 --> 01:27:12.649
Their lungs burst from the explosion.

01:27:13.609 --> 01:27:14.860
Now get on with it.

01:27:16.153 --> 01:27:18.322
Get those earrings off pinkie dress.

01:27:26.038 --> 01:27:27.788
Oh, Beryl,

01:27:27.789 --> 01:27:30.875
- would you like to join us?
- Oh, thank you.

01:27:30.876 --> 01:27:34.378
- Waiter! Bubbles please, waiter.
- Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

01:27:34.379 --> 01:27:36.923
Is this your new girlfriend, Albert?

01:27:36.924 --> 01:27:39.343
This is my good lady friend, Edwina.

01:27:41.261 --> 01:27:44.598
Oh, lovely.
She's good fun, but she's a bit stiff.

01:27:45.849 --> 01:27:48.184
- May I top you up, sir?
- Get it in there.

01:27:48.185 --> 01:27:50.019
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:51.938
To you and all that may sail in you.

01:27:51.939 --> 01:27:54.065
- This is nice.
- A bit more.

01:27:54.066 --> 01:27:55.651
Right and all, we deserve this.

01:27:56.568 --> 01:27:58.444
You look divine today, dear.

01:27:58.445 --> 01:27:59.696
Oh, thank you so much.

01:28:01.782 --> 01:28:02.698
How lovely.

01:28:02.699 --> 01:28:04.450
Give us an hand. Come on.

01:28:04.451 --> 01:28:05.702
Come on!

01:28:29.768 --> 01:28:32.229
Clear out!

01:28:33.230 --> 01:28:36.065
- Hurry up! Come on!
- Clear out, everyone!

01:28:36.066 --> 01:28:38.151
Come on!

01:28:42.281 --> 01:28:45.324
<i>Show me the way to go home</i>

01:28:45.325 --> 01:28:49.370
<i>I'm tired and I wanna go to bed</i>

01:28:49.371 --> 01:28:56.252
<i>I had a little drink about an hour ago
And it's gone right to my head</i>

01:28:56.253 --> 01:29:00.131
<i>Wherever I may roam</i>

01:29:00.132 --> 01:29:03.510
<i>On land or sea or foam</i>

01:29:04.094 --> 01:29:07.722
<i>You can always hear me singing a song</i>

01:29:07.723 --> 01:29:10.349
<i>Show me the way to go home</i>

01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:12.352
It's all right, mate. Safe here with us.

01:29:13.353 --> 01:29:16.273
<i>Show me the way to go home</i>

01:29:16.982 --> 01:29:20.319
<i>I'm tired and I wanna go to bed</i>

01:29:21.028 --> 01:29:27.492
<i>I had a little drink about an hour ago
And it's gone right to my head</i>

01:29:28.327 --> 01:29:34.541
<i>Wherever I may roam
On land or sea or foam</i>

01:29:35.209 --> 01:29:41.924
<i>You can always hear me singing a song
Show me the way to go home</i>

01:31:36.538 --> 01:31:38.999
Get in there! Get in there now!

01:32:02.898 --> 01:32:05.567
No, that's not fair to Hitler!

01:32:10.948 --> 01:32:12.490
That's what I've been doing.

01:32:12.491 --> 01:32:15.034
What about Punch, Hitler?

01:32:15.035 --> 01:32:16.245
Punch Hitler?

01:32:17.579 --> 01:32:18.872
Certainly.

01:32:20.874 --> 01:32:22.875
That's the way we do it.

01:32:22.876 --> 01:32:26.754
No, Mr. Punch. You dare.
How dare you punch me?

01:32:26.755 --> 01:32:29.340
You're meant to say "Hail Hitler."

01:32:29.341 --> 01:32:30.801
Hail Hitler?

01:32:31.552 --> 01:32:34.971
I wish there was some hail.
It is very hot and muggy down here.

01:32:34.972 --> 01:32:36.974
Maybe even a bit of rain.

01:32:39.476 --> 01:32:41.352
What is it about you English?

01:32:41.353 --> 01:32:43.855
Always talking about the weather.

01:32:43.856 --> 01:32:45.857
I mean, "Hail Hitler."

01:32:45.858 --> 01:32:49.610
Raise your arm like this
and say, "Hail Hitler."

01:32:49.611 --> 01:32:52.947
Like this. Raise my arm like this and say,

01:32:52.948 --> 01:32:55.992
"Hail Hitler." Hitler, Hitler, Hitler.

01:32:55.993 --> 01:32:58.078
That's the way to do it.

01:32:59.204 --> 01:33:03.875
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

01:33:03.876 --> 01:33:06.461
You've been lovely. Thank you.

01:33:27.649 --> 01:33:32.778
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention please?

01:33:32.779 --> 01:33:37.700
All right, everybody out.
There are no more trains running tonight.

01:33:37.701 --> 01:33:40.286
I've got a right to be here.
I paid for a ticket.

01:33:40.287 --> 01:33:43.581
That is a ticket to travel, madam,
not to stay overnight.

01:33:43.582 --> 01:33:45.791
I'm waiting for me train
till it gets here.

01:33:45.792 --> 01:33:46.709
Me too!

01:33:46.710 --> 01:33:49.378
There won't be a train until the morning.

01:33:49.379 --> 01:33:50.463
We're early.

01:33:50.464 --> 01:33:52.590
We don't mind waiting. We're British.

01:33:52.591 --> 01:33:54.800
Rules are the rules. I didn't make them.

01:33:54.801 --> 01:33:57.053
Do you know what's going on up there?

01:33:57.054 --> 01:33:58.555
Sling your hook.

01:33:59.598 --> 01:34:02.225
Go on! On your bike.

01:34:02.226 --> 01:34:04.519
There's the way out! Keep going!

01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:05.604
Who threw--

01:34:06.772 --> 01:34:08.397
Go on, you jobsworth.

01:34:08.398 --> 01:34:11.735
There's no more capacity.
We've gotta lock the gates.

01:38:50.848 --> 01:38:55.184
<i>Fare thee well for now</i>

01:38:55.185 --> 01:38:58.689
<i>Brighter days soon in bloom</i>

01:38:59.857 --> 01:39:03.943
<i>Maybe this is the sign</i>

01:39:03.944 --> 01:39:08.823
<i>To hang upon thy dear heart</i>

01:39:08.824 --> 01:39:13.494
<i>Lift thine eyes toward mine</i>

01:39:13.495 --> 01:39:17.999
<i>I'm coming home to you</i>

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.587
<i>Hold thy light through the night</i>

01:39:22.588 --> 01:39:27.091
<i>Find your way back ashore</i>

01:39:27.092 --> 01:39:31.762
<i>Good friends and better wine</i>

01:39:31.763 --> 01:39:36.184
<i>Welcome you at the door</i>

01:39:36.185 --> 01:39:40.521
<i>Maybe this is the sign</i>

01:39:40.522 --> 01:39:45.401
<i>To hang upon thy dear heart</i>

01:39:45.402 --> 01:39:49.906
<i>Fate will sweeten the vine</i>

01:39:49.907 --> 01:39:55.037
<i>Sorrow to taste no more</i>

01:40:18.393 --> 01:40:19.895
What is that?

01:40:35.577 --> 01:40:36.745
What is that?

01:40:40.707 --> 01:40:42.042
I don't know.

01:41:45.355 --> 01:41:47.357
Come on. This way.

01:42:05.501 --> 01:42:07.503
Hold on to me. Come on.

01:42:08.504 --> 01:42:09.505
Come on.

01:42:10.547 --> 01:42:13.216
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

01:42:13.217 --> 01:42:14.676
Let's go.

01:42:16.678 --> 01:42:18.805
Come on.

01:42:21.517 --> 01:42:23.936
Come on!

01:42:39.284 --> 01:42:40.786
Kid! Over here!

01:42:45.916 --> 01:42:49.710
See if you can fit through underneath
and get some help.

01:42:49.711 --> 01:42:50.879
You got that?

01:42:52.297 --> 01:42:53.549
Give it your best, son.

01:43:03.475 --> 01:43:04.685
Wait!

01:43:05.561 --> 01:43:06.770
He's stuck!

01:43:20.993 --> 01:43:23.871
All clear.

01:43:24.413 --> 01:43:26.205
So I've gotta go and help out
at the station,

01:43:26.206 --> 01:43:28.208
but look after yourself, yeah?

01:43:29.334 --> 01:43:31.336
I'll catch up with you tomorrow.

01:46:04.781 --> 01:46:07.576
Our little hero is finally awake.

01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:11.663
You saved a lot of lives, you know?

01:46:12.497 --> 01:46:15.042
If you hadn't have gotten help,
more people would have di...

01:46:16.210 --> 01:46:18.545
How are you feeling this morning, love?

01:46:26.803 --> 01:46:28.055
Where's my St. Christopher?

01:46:28.639 --> 01:46:33.060
It's here, love. It's on the dresser.
And your clothes are drying on the rack.

01:46:33.810 --> 01:46:35.312
My name's Ruby.

01:46:35.938 --> 01:46:37.105
Now...

01:46:40.567 --> 01:46:43.028
here you are. You drink this.
Lovely cup of tea.

01:46:43.654 --> 01:46:45.279
Could I have my necklace please?

01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:46.573
Course you can.

01:46:51.703 --> 01:46:53.789
You're George Hanway, aren't you?

01:46:55.499 --> 01:46:57.834
There's a lot of people
been looking for you.

01:46:57.835 --> 01:46:59.294
Did you know that?

01:47:00.504 --> 01:47:04.299
You're a very brave, lucky boy.

01:47:06.927 --> 01:47:09.554
Right. Gonna get you some breakfast,

01:47:09.555 --> 01:47:13.099
a basin of hot water
so you can give yourself a good wash

01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:14.892
and then I can walk you home.

01:47:14.893 --> 01:47:16.270
It's not far.

01:47:17.312 --> 01:47:19.773
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:47:22.067 --> 01:47:23.151
I won't be long.

01:47:52.139 --> 01:47:53.764
- Morning, Constable.
- Morning.

01:47:53.765 --> 01:47:54.849
Is he up yet?

01:47:54.850 --> 01:47:57.768
He's just woken. He'll be ready soon.
And then we can take him down the station.

01:47:57.769 --> 01:47:59.605
- Cup of tea?
- Lovely.

01:49:47.296 --> 01:49:48.297
Olly.

01:49:49.006 --> 01:49:50.841
Is that your name? Your name Olly?

01:49:54.136 --> 01:49:55.137
Mum?

01:49:59.474 --> 01:50:00.726
Granddad!

01:50:11.028 --> 01:50:12.446
Granddad!

01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:19.036
George?

01:50:27.085 --> 01:50:28.962
- George.
- Mum.

01:50:33.759 --> 01:50:34.801
Mum.

01:50:36.011 --> 01:50:39.181
- Mum.
- George. It's all right.

01:50:39.848 --> 01:50:42.392
It's all right.

01:50:44.686 --> 01:50:45.812
It's all right.

01:50:47.648 --> 01:50:49.149
I'll never let you go again.

01:50:53.195 --> 01:50:54.488
It's all right.

01:52:08.896 --> 01:52:09.980
<i>Make a wish.</i>

01:52:11.064 --> 01:52:13.525
- <i>One wish?</i>
- <i>One wish.</i>
