WEBVTT

00:01.209 --> 00:02.877
<i>Previously on</i> Billions.

00:02.877 --> 00:04.295
<i>We got Nancy Dunlop</i>

00:04.295 --> 00:05.505
<i>burning up the track
ahead of us.</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:07.090
- Hoot-hoot!
- Hoot-hoot!

00:07.090 --> 00:10.844
You are my beau ideal
of a presidential candidate.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.013
I want to talk about
how I can help you secure it.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.557
Your former man Winston
is shopping a new piece

00:15.557 --> 00:17.017
<i>of risk-management software.</i>

00:17.017 --> 00:18.727
You will surrender
the software immediately,

00:18.727 --> 00:20.979
as it is the property
of Michael Prince Capital.

00:20.979 --> 00:22.689
<i>We know that Wags and Wendy</i>

00:22.689 --> 00:24.774
<i>were also with Taylor,
and went to Axelrod.</i>

00:24.774 --> 00:26.359
<i>So, if you try
anything, it won't be you</i>

00:26.359 --> 00:28.361
who'll suffer,
it'll be Wendy Rhoades.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.905
With a new leadership structure
comes new opportunity,

00:30.905 --> 00:32.157
every rung of the ladder.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.616
<i>It's gonna be a bloodbath.</i>

00:36.494 --> 00:38.163
<i>You see, this is the problem</i>

00:38.163 --> 00:39.706
with squaring away
your enemies list.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.375
You wake up all your enemies
in the process.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.169
Welcome home, Bobby.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.421
Thank God you're here.

00:46.421 --> 00:48.631
Ain't that
the motherfucking truth.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.383
Now let's get to work.

01:31.966 --> 01:34.511
<i>I had skin like leather</i>

01:34.511 --> 01:37.806
<i>And the diamond-hard
Look of a cobra</i>

01:40.183 --> 01:42.727
<i>I was born
Blue and weathered</i>

01:42.727 --> 01:45.855
<i>But I burst
Just like a supernova</i>

01:48.066 --> 01:52.320
<i>I could walk like Brando
Right into the sun</i>

01:52.320 --> 01:57.367
<i>Then dance
Just like a Casanova</i>

01:58.535 --> 02:00.161
<i>With my blackjack
And jacket</i>

02:00.161 --> 02:02.205
<i>And my hair slicked sweet</i>

02:02.205 --> 02:06.084
<i>Silver star studs on my duds
Just like a Harley in heat</i>

02:06.084 --> 02:10.547
<i>When I strut down the street
I could hear its heart beat</i>

02:10.547 --> 02:12.715
<i>The sisters fell back
And said</i>

02:12.715 --> 02:14.717
<i>"Don't that man
Look pretty"</i>

02:14.717 --> 02:17.387
<i>The cripple on the corner
Cried out</i>

02:17.387 --> 02:19.973
Hi, I just tried texting you.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.475
We up and running?
Everything going smooth?

02:22.475 --> 02:24.269
<i>It's so hard to be a saint</i>

02:24.269 --> 02:27.522
<i>In the city</i>

02:38.449 --> 02:40.160
Mike.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.289
You should have told me
you were coming

02:44.289 --> 02:46.457
so I could've had a strong,
fresh-brewed cup

02:46.457 --> 02:48.710
of get the fuck out
waiting for you.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.378
Oh, I'll leave.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.881
But first, let me tell you
how I spent yesterday.

03:01.764 --> 03:03.224
As per your

03:03.224 --> 03:05.143
"we're getting out of-slash-
poised to get out of"...

03:05.143 --> 03:07.103
I have orders at the ready
for our traders here

03:07.103 --> 03:08.980
to start unloading
at the opening bell, but--

03:08.980 --> 03:10.106
- Copy.
- You can't copy

03:10.106 --> 03:11.608
while there's a "but" out there.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.193
The but says, "Don't copy yet,
there's more to discuss."

03:13.193 --> 03:14.569
And the word "order,"
which you used,

03:14.569 --> 03:15.904
says there's nothing
left to discuss.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.363
It's the rock,
paper and scissors

03:17.363 --> 03:19.574
of organizational structure.
Get it done.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.242
You need to hear that we
are going to take a real hit,

03:21.242 --> 03:23.620
optics-wise and wallet-wise.
We will look scared.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.581
We are scared. Or at least
on guard, as is appropriate.

03:26.581 --> 03:28.666
There could be lawsuits
from our investors and LPs.

03:28.666 --> 03:30.001
Spyros and Sacker
have both flagged

03:30.001 --> 03:32.170
possible legal liability
if we really dump

03:32.170 --> 03:33.963
out of this stuff too quickly
and take losses.

03:33.963 --> 03:36.299
I understand all that, and will
deal with it when and if.

03:36.299 --> 03:40.136
So, yeah, you really have to
tell me to push the button and--

03:40.136 --> 03:41.679
I did.
That's what I said.

03:41.679 --> 03:42.931
In the heat of the moment, sure.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.349
But now,
in the calm of the after,

03:44.349 --> 03:46.267
maybe we do some
deep-breathing exercises,

03:46.267 --> 03:48.478
get that oxygenated blood
to sort of set our somatics

03:48.478 --> 03:50.480
back to normal,
and then review the decision

03:50.480 --> 03:51.981
to basically have
a Korvettes-level

03:51.981 --> 03:53.566
"everything must go"
kind of fire sale.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.068
Somatic system, limbic system,

03:55.068 --> 03:56.986
brain waves
all functioning well.

03:56.986 --> 03:59.113
I had to push aside
all the emotional pain

03:59.113 --> 04:01.824
associated with this move to get
to a place of pure rationality.

04:01.824 --> 04:03.993
This is not a rash decision.
It's reasoned.

04:03.993 --> 04:06.162
I know, because
I don't want to do it.

04:06.162 --> 04:07.622
I don't want to do it.
You do.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.457
Leadership is pumping
the brakes on "want"

04:09.457 --> 04:12.377
and putting pedal to the floor
on that which needs to be done.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.170
You will structure
the liquidation

04:14.170 --> 04:15.838
and execute it at the open.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.676
I will.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.970
Yes. Okay.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.596
Give me specifics.
What can we keep?

04:23.596 --> 04:25.723
You can't keep anything.
Get us flat.

04:25.723 --> 04:27.600
Everything becomes cash,

04:27.600 --> 04:30.853
and exposure to Axelrod
and his attacks goes to zero.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.607
This is a guy
who's strip-mined towns,

04:34.607 --> 04:36.651
knocked out
prominent families,

04:36.651 --> 04:38.695
taken over boards,
blown up firms,

04:38.695 --> 04:40.697
sabotaged thriving companies.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.365
Killed my ambassadorship.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.784
zero.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.369
And that's not even
considering Rhoades

04:46.369 --> 04:48.162
and all the crud he has
the capacity to do to us.

04:48.162 --> 04:50.373
No, will stay out unless
and until we are bulletproof.

04:50.373 --> 04:53.793
Only after we establish
completely favorable conditions

04:53.793 --> 04:56.129
do we plow back in.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.143
Jumping out in front of it,
like Sauce Gardner.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.186
If you think I'm stopping there,
you don't know me.

05:12.186 --> 05:14.397
Oh, I know you.
I watch close.

05:14.397 --> 05:17.066
Yeah, I would imagine you do.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.568
Which is why
I was watching everything.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.070
All my people.
All the things they do.

05:21.070 --> 05:22.363
Everything.

05:22.363 --> 05:24.699
Yeah. You said.

05:25.950 --> 05:28.286
I guess it's always important
to keep a close eye

05:28.286 --> 05:30.872
when your people are really
your kidnap victims.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.373
No, Axe, not a close eye.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.334
A thousand eyes and ears,

05:34.334 --> 05:37.211
and the software
to make sense of it all.

05:37.211 --> 05:40.131
I stepped it up before I got
on that plane to come see you.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.175
He's back, as you can see.
We are back.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.801
Already up and running.

05:43.801 --> 05:46.596
I don't have to pitch you the
feeling of coming home, do I?

05:46.596 --> 05:48.348
I can see on your faces

05:48.348 --> 05:50.350
the effect
is already hitting you.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.978
Yeah. Emotions
are present, no doubt.

05:53.978 --> 05:55.396
Strong pull
to join forces again,

05:55.396 --> 05:57.398
but there are
other forces at play.

05:58.733 --> 05:59.901
Even more powerful.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.570
Fucking feelings
can't run this show.

06:02.570 --> 06:05.156
If they did, I'd be all day
coaching middle school baseball.

06:05.156 --> 06:07.450
You'll have time to
if you stay with Prince.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.827
Nothing else for you to do.

06:09.827 --> 06:11.454
He's pulling out of everything.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.081
How much did he consult you
about that?

06:13.081 --> 06:14.916
How much control
do you really have?

06:14.916 --> 06:17.502
How much do you want to be able
to control your destiny?

06:17.502 --> 06:20.463
I control my destiny.
We all do.

06:20.463 --> 06:23.132
By staying at a place
that isn't even making trades?

06:23.132 --> 06:25.968
A money market account,
not a hedge fund?

06:25.968 --> 06:27.345
We can't do what you did.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.389
We can't leave all we
worked for at risk,

06:29.389 --> 06:31.349
gated at a place
we've alienated.

06:31.349 --> 06:34.602
You can.
You just get past the money.

06:34.602 --> 06:38.189
You remember that risking it all
is what animates you.

06:38.189 --> 06:40.775
It is all that animates you.
Or it used to.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.694
What about you?

06:44.862 --> 06:47.031
You were never
just about the money.

06:51.494 --> 06:54.580
Me, 20 years ago,
would have said fuck yes.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.915
But now?

06:55.915 --> 06:57.583
I am too old.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.377
Don't go full Murtaugh.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.879
It's too depressing
from former warriors.

07:03.005 --> 07:04.257
Not being willing to lose

07:04.257 --> 07:05.466
everything I've made

07:05.466 --> 07:07.385
isn't the same as retirement.

07:07.385 --> 07:08.886
And Axe'll understand.

07:08.886 --> 07:11.431
He fucking taught us
to play the best hand

07:11.431 --> 07:13.015
to make the most money.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.600
Yeah.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.769
We're there now,
at Prince Capital.

07:16.769 --> 07:19.730
All our money,
our whole fucking future.

07:19.730 --> 07:22.066
We gotta make
this thing crush.

07:22.066 --> 07:24.193
Whether or not
he becomes president,

07:24.193 --> 07:27.321
our money is still
onboard there.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.510
It's a really nice office.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.886
We need Nancy Dunlop.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.054
Do we?

08:33.054 --> 08:34.472
I took her out
at The Owl.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.224
Yes, and you got
Fourth Pike's support.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.434
But the rest of the country,
the parts that love her,

08:38.434 --> 08:39.685
weren't privy to that.

08:39.685 --> 08:41.229
Next step,
now that she's beaten,

08:41.229 --> 08:43.940
is for her to publicly declare
she's with you.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.568
I need the investment stuff here
resolved first.

08:47.568 --> 08:50.780
But, uh, I get that you're
jonesing pretty hard over this,

08:50.780 --> 08:52.365
- so lay it out.
- Okay.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.033
First of all,
she's in New York.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.243
And if you win her over,

08:55.243 --> 08:56.953
Dunlop turns her
organization over to us.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.038
That means her field operatives
around the country

08:59.038 --> 09:00.456
and the voter data.

09:00.456 --> 09:03.417
We get Montana and likely
the other Western states.

09:03.417 --> 09:06.712
This is the leading Democrat
giving you her troops

09:06.712 --> 09:07.964
and her endorsement.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.966
Email lists, donor lists,

09:09.966 --> 09:11.425
dark money orgs,
links to unions,

09:11.425 --> 09:13.052
lefty groups, grassroots.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.762
The keys
to the whole candy store.

09:14.762 --> 09:17.431
That's right. We wouldn't have
to build and stock our own.

09:17.431 --> 09:18.724
And once you have all that,

09:18.724 --> 09:20.977
you are the presumptive candidate.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.311
The front-runner.

09:22.311 --> 09:23.938
The presidential intelligence
briefings start,

09:23.938 --> 09:26.148
which will make you,
for all intents and purposes,

09:26.148 --> 09:27.358
the heir apparent.

09:27.358 --> 09:28.859
First time in the modern age

09:28.859 --> 09:32.029
an independent candidate
would be in that perch.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.240
I get it.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.242
Book her for dinner,
but I'm not doing anything

09:36.242 --> 09:38.578
until the money
is taken care of here.

09:49.213 --> 09:50.464
I'll say this for you, Axe.

09:50.464 --> 09:52.967
You trained Dollar Bill
and Victor well.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.594
They did the right thing,

09:54.594 --> 09:56.804
like Henry Hill
after the Air France heist.

09:56.804 --> 10:00.308
They paid tribute.
They kicked up.

10:00.308 --> 10:02.602
The important thing is
we said no.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.021
Unequivocally. To Axe.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.523
We hardly even heard him out.

10:07.523 --> 10:09.233
Axe approached you,
you rebuffed him.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.610
This is the thing?

10:10.610 --> 10:12.278
- His proxy, yes.
- Taylor.

10:12.278 --> 10:15.197
Way we figure it, this is the
rocket ship we want to be on.

10:15.197 --> 10:16.574
And they came
right to me.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.200
Didn't waffle. Didn't evade.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.952
Didn't make us go to them.
Same with Rian.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.162
She emailed, though,

10:21.162 --> 10:22.872
said she's not
in a talking mood.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.964
Good.
These are the trusteds.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.132
You all are.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.717
So start finding me
base hit trades.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.678
Singles and doubles only,
with predefined exits.

10:37.678 --> 10:40.306
When we go back in,
it'll be a big, concerted move.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.849
Only moves worth making.

10:41.849 --> 10:43.643
I've got some ideas,
stuff I'm looking at.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.227
- We start with--
- But not yet.

10:45.227 --> 10:47.688
Not until I'm bulletproof.

10:48.856 --> 10:51.108
Prepare. But don't act.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.497
How come you two
didn't run to me or Philip?

11:06.791 --> 11:11.337
Uh, these-- these two
are good guys and good earners.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.006
And they weren't even there.
Didn't go see him.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.552
- It's true what he says.
- But they were invited.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.388
You were, weren't you?

11:21.806 --> 11:23.015
You were touched,

11:23.015 --> 11:25.768
invited to go hear a pitch
from Axe Global.

11:27.603 --> 11:29.146
You didn't report it.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.649
We also didn't go.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.359
As Dollar Bill said.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.819
Because your feelings
ran so deep

11:34.819 --> 11:36.320
you couldn't
bear passing in person?

11:36.320 --> 11:38.447
You knew if you looked upon him
you would submit.

11:38.447 --> 11:40.491
Is that right?

11:42.034 --> 11:45.204
- Sounds right.
- I said it, so, yeah.

11:46.622 --> 11:47.998
It is.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.796
But we didn't go.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.173
We're not the bad guys here.

11:56.173 --> 11:58.384
Nope. You're not.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.054
But so what?

12:02.054 --> 12:04.890
Good guys, good earners.
Go join a 4H club.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.268
I'll find more.
You're both fired.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.687
What the fuck?

12:09.687 --> 12:11.522
These emotions you have
can be played in ways

12:11.522 --> 12:12.898
you aren't even
gonna be aware of.

12:12.898 --> 12:16.277
You're a risk to me.
Or were. Goodbye.

12:42.845 --> 12:46.348
You understand why Prince
had to let Ben Kim and Tuk go.

12:46.348 --> 12:48.768
I understood what the man said.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.227
Is that how you
would have handled it?

12:50.227 --> 12:51.437
I don't know,

12:51.437 --> 12:53.022
but I saw the logic
of it instantly.

12:53.981 --> 12:55.441
Do you ever disagree?

12:56.400 --> 12:57.568
If you do,
does he listen?

12:57.568 --> 12:59.153
We communicate all day long

12:59.153 --> 13:00.446
in ways verbal
and otherwise.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.739
He knows where I stand.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.574
And that'll carry over
to Washington?

13:03.574 --> 13:05.493
- That's the plan.
- You're good with that?

13:05.493 --> 13:07.578
You see him in the chair?

13:07.578 --> 13:09.079
You have doubts?

13:09.079 --> 13:12.166
No. I just like him here,
steering this big boy of a ship.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.376
You will still feel his
steady hand on the rudder

13:14.376 --> 13:17.421
whenever you fear
you might lose control of it.

13:17.421 --> 13:18.672
But you won't need that.

13:18.672 --> 13:20.674
By then, you will be
fully ready.

13:21.550 --> 13:22.927
Yes, sir.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.137
That's how you feel, isn't it?

13:25.137 --> 13:26.680
Solid with all this right now?

13:26.680 --> 13:28.849
As a slab
of Carrara marble, Unc.

13:28.849 --> 13:31.060
And you can get done
what you need to

13:31.060 --> 13:32.853
with the personnel left
at your disposal?

13:32.853 --> 13:34.188
Not a problem.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.606
Good.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.740
Sadly,
your move to hire back

13:44.740 --> 13:46.700
your people out
from under me failed,

13:46.700 --> 13:48.536
like nearly everything
you've tried lately.

13:48.536 --> 13:51.247
Not everything, Mike, huh?

13:55.167 --> 13:56.585
Where you headed?

13:58.003 --> 13:59.463
Call me for the next
campaign event.

13:59.463 --> 14:01.340
I'll live up
to my end of the agreement.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.467
Till then, I'll be
bouldering in the 'Gunks.

14:03.467 --> 14:05.219
With Derek?

14:06.720 --> 14:08.430
Now you're not talking?

14:09.515 --> 14:11.225
Don't, Mike.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.227
We're don't ask,
don't tell again?

14:13.227 --> 14:15.688
We agreed to pause the
arrangement during the campaign.

14:15.688 --> 14:19.400
That agreement got overridden
by certain other actions.

14:21.485 --> 14:23.320
Tell me I'm wrong.

14:24.321 --> 14:26.532
This can be used against me.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.325
It has been.

14:28.325 --> 14:31.662
Which raises the question
of who did what first?

14:32.788 --> 14:34.790
Not a question
I'm interested in.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.126
So I'm going off the grid.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.879
Nothing will be known,
nothing will be raised,

14:39.879 --> 14:42.298
nothing will be written.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.300
I'm just gonna go do my thing,

14:44.300 --> 14:46.927
while you continue to do yours.

14:47.803 --> 14:49.179
As always.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.606
Derek sent a picture.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.609
Big rocks.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.652
Don't get too excited.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.321
I kept my focus on business.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.323
There's a matter
I need to read you in on.

15:07.323 --> 15:10.993
But first, did you handle
the prior matter? Winston?

15:14.079 --> 15:16.916
"Bring me my Bow
of burning gold:

15:18.042 --> 15:21.045
Bring me my Arrows of desire:

15:21.045 --> 15:23.380
Bring me my Spear:

15:23.380 --> 15:25.674
O clouds unfold!

15:25.674 --> 15:29.053
Bring me my Chariot of fire!"

15:30.179 --> 15:32.640
Do I need a bow,
a spear, a chariot?

15:32.640 --> 15:36.268
Nay, we just need
your algorithm.

15:36.268 --> 15:40.606
You know, ChatGPT-4 can adjust
the tone of the words it uses

15:40.606 --> 15:42.733
to meet the vernacular
of the questioner.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.693
Some humans can do same.

15:44.693 --> 15:46.445
Let me try.

15:46.445 --> 15:49.156
Reviewing contents
of entire Internet.

15:49.156 --> 15:51.617
Matching your inane
turn of phrase.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.869
And, yes, locked in.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.621
Let's try this:

15:55.621 --> 15:57.748
"So you ride yourselves
over the fields

15:57.748 --> 16:00.542
and you make
all your animal deals,

16:00.542 --> 16:03.963
and your wise men
don't know how it feels

16:03.963 --> 16:06.548
to be thick as a brick."

16:07.299 --> 16:08.550
Yeah, that works.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.594
Ah, the Tull.

16:10.594 --> 16:13.639
Love it, love it, loave it.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.724
Thick as a brick.

16:15.724 --> 16:17.351
Hard no on that.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.103
I can set an after-school
playdate for you two

16:19.103 --> 16:21.021
to continue along these
engaging lines, but first--

16:21.021 --> 16:23.065
What I'm pointing out
is he must be thick as a brick

16:23.065 --> 16:26.402
to ask for what he and you
and this place already have:

16:26.402 --> 16:27.569
my algo.

16:27.569 --> 16:28.737
No, I got it,

16:28.737 --> 16:30.280
but what we need specifically

16:30.280 --> 16:33.450
is for you to reset
the parameters on the risk algo.

16:33.450 --> 16:36.286
Dial back profit
as prime objective temporarily

16:36.286 --> 16:38.247
in order to really
protect downside.

16:38.247 --> 16:41.250
Yeah, that kind of adjustment
is not in the deal.

16:41.250 --> 16:44.169
The spirit of the arrangement
we made, Winston, should--

16:44.169 --> 16:45.754
I'm more
a "letter of the contract"

16:45.754 --> 16:47.464
sort of guy, you know?
So...

16:47.464 --> 16:51.635
"The letter killeth,
but the spirit giveth life."

16:51.635 --> 16:55.347
That's some New Testament shit,
you hear me?

16:55.347 --> 16:56.890
I see it like this.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.226
I could remind you of
all the various and sundry ways

16:59.226 --> 17:01.061
that I could ruin your life.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.272
Or I could treat you
like a valued,

17:03.272 --> 17:06.567
important and brilliant
member of the team,

17:06.567 --> 17:08.110
being asked to roll up
the sleeves.

17:08.110 --> 17:09.903
It's not about
the work it'll take.

17:09.903 --> 17:12.573
That's fine. I'm Wozniak on
'roids up in this motherfucker.

17:12.573 --> 17:15.159
Nope. It's about ego.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.410
You just said that.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.662
Ego, which translates
into dollars.

17:18.662 --> 17:20.748
The whole thing is,
I am in the process

17:20.748 --> 17:22.291
of careering
off of this algorithm,

17:22.291 --> 17:23.709
and for that to be the case,

17:23.709 --> 17:25.252
I need it to be
a money-making machine.

17:25.252 --> 17:27.171
- Which it is.
- I get it.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.465
So, what dollar figure
would you attach

17:29.465 --> 17:31.133
to the sublimation of that ego

17:31.133 --> 17:34.636
in order for us to get
what we need right now?

17:34.636 --> 17:37.848
It's a seven-figure number
that starts with "Oh, shit!"

17:37.848 --> 17:39.892
That'll be fine.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.770
Get started today. Now.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.521
We have a time frame.

17:44.521 --> 17:46.356
It's right fucking now.

17:46.356 --> 17:47.941
That's not what I'm here
to walk through.

17:47.941 --> 17:50.861
Well, can it wait?
Today is about the money first.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.863
This is about the money.

17:52.863 --> 17:55.741
I expected Chuck
would be strategizing

17:55.741 --> 17:57.117
with former Axe Cappers.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.327
Didn't know where else

17:58.327 --> 17:59.703
the radar blip would come from,

17:59.703 --> 18:01.163
but I was ready.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.462
Based on the binder Chuck
has so graciously provided,

18:08.462 --> 18:11.507
we have a pretty good overview
of Prince's private holdings.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.426
Now this brain trust
can lay out an attack plan.

18:14.426 --> 18:17.054
Best targets in my opinion
are the restaurant group,

18:17.054 --> 18:19.515
the meat-processing plants,
clothing chains,

18:19.515 --> 18:21.183
and auto parts manufacturers.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.643
Hey, do you mind if I burn one?

18:22.643 --> 18:23.852
Uh, I do mind.

18:23.852 --> 18:26.730
Whomsoever ordered these, whoa.

18:26.730 --> 18:29.024
Well, it's Kensington Deli, so...

18:29.024 --> 18:32.152
Hey, let's lay out
how to attack this shit.

18:32.152 --> 18:34.113
All are vulnerable
to misinformation,

18:34.113 --> 18:36.657
disinformation,
false information,

18:36.657 --> 18:39.660
all designed to drive
the enterprise value down.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.996
Once the balance sheets start
to wobble, it just gets easier.

18:42.996 --> 18:44.873
There's also
sabotage from within.

18:44.873 --> 18:48.293
Infiltrate personnel in
to encourage internal conflict.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.337
Disputes among
the management team.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.339
Create divisions
between employees.

18:52.339 --> 18:54.049
Foster a toxic
work environment.

18:54.049 --> 18:55.759
I, for one, know how
debilitating that can be.

18:55.759 --> 18:58.053
It really does lead
to decreased productivity

18:58.053 --> 18:59.429
and a weakened company culture.

18:59.429 --> 19:00.806
You sure I can't burn one?

19:00.806 --> 19:02.349
I'll blow the smoke
out of the window.

19:02.349 --> 19:04.143
It makes my synapses
fire faster.

19:06.019 --> 19:07.688
I know that's not
what it typically does,

19:07.688 --> 19:11.233
but my doctor says I have
a paradoxical reaction to weed.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.943
Your doctor says that?

19:12.943 --> 19:14.987
I mean, she's not
technically a doctor.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.321
More of a spirit walker.

19:16.321 --> 19:17.698
Answer's still no.

19:17.698 --> 19:20.409
There are also
poison pill strategies.

19:20.409 --> 19:23.412
Clandestinely encourage
unethical business practices.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.205
- Bribery, you mean?
- Sure.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.748
If you want
to get earthy about it.

19:26.748 --> 19:29.293
Which you fellas could then
investigate and announce.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.545
And legal entanglements.

19:31.545 --> 19:34.173
Lawsuits designed
to tie up their resources

19:34.173 --> 19:35.632
in lengthy battles
that distract them

19:35.632 --> 19:37.801
from their core
business operations.

19:44.224 --> 19:46.476
Amanda, you have
a grand jury suit?

19:46.476 --> 19:49.313
'Cause you're gonna need it.
Lots of appearances coming up.

19:49.313 --> 19:52.274
We've stumbled upon a whole
bunch of dirty companies,

19:52.274 --> 19:53.650
as you see.

19:53.650 --> 19:57.196
You're going to probably need
more than one.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.655
Try something
without stripes.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.949
- They moiré.
- And get it quick.

20:00.949 --> 20:03.702
Grand jury's open,
and we're going with a long list

20:03.702 --> 20:05.204
of charges
against these companies.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.455
We expect indictments.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.831
You want me to suit up

20:07.831 --> 20:09.625
for something
we're six months away on?

20:09.625 --> 20:11.418
Six months? No.

20:11.418 --> 20:12.961
We're announcing these investigations

20:12.961 --> 20:14.838
and coming charges tomorrow.

20:16.256 --> 20:18.383
All of these companies
are owned by Michael Prince,

20:18.383 --> 20:19.676
or his subsidiaries.

20:19.676 --> 20:21.011
Mm, that's right.

20:21.011 --> 20:23.055
We hurt the companies,
and we hurt Prince.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.932
- Badly.
- Tag the companies as bad.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.308
Ruin them without knowing

20:26.308 --> 20:27.768
if anything criminal
actually happened.

20:27.768 --> 20:30.437
Do the investigation
after the fact.

20:30.437 --> 20:33.357
I plan on using the power
of this office to its fullest,

20:33.357 --> 20:34.858
and I expect you
to do the same.

20:34.858 --> 20:37.110
Otherwise
it is wasted on you,

20:37.110 --> 20:39.905
and will be given to someone
not so easily offended.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.449
You don't see me
clutching my pearls.

20:42.449 --> 20:43.951
I don't even own any.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.286
Guys, there is
an order to things.

20:46.286 --> 20:49.998
Learn of a crime, investigate,
confirm, announce,

20:49.998 --> 20:53.085
so that only companies
that are bad actors are hurt.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.671
And I assure you
we will find crimes.

20:55.671 --> 20:58.507
Fruit of a poison tree
called Michael Prince.

21:00.550 --> 21:01.927
You're okay with this?

21:01.927 --> 21:03.512
We have enough to start.

21:03.512 --> 21:06.390
And I will slumber
like a wee babe tonight.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.184
While I will sleep as always:

21:09.184 --> 21:11.270
deeply, but only 20 minutes
at a time.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.606
But, yes,
free of moral paroxysms.

21:16.358 --> 21:19.361
There are thousands of employees
at these companies.

21:19.361 --> 21:22.197
Working people who will not be
once we start this.

21:22.197 --> 21:24.908
When one man rises
to this level of threat,

21:24.908 --> 21:27.577
that is the way the system
must be used.

21:32.582 --> 21:34.084
You're not in law school anymore.

21:34.084 --> 21:35.752
This is the show.

21:36.878 --> 21:38.755
So you have two choices,
Miss Torre.

21:38.755 --> 21:40.632
You can do your job
and write the briefs

21:40.632 --> 21:43.677
and stand with us as we announce
these investigations tomorrow,

21:43.677 --> 21:46.305
or be complicit.

22:11.413 --> 22:14.082
Is it just us, or are we
waiting for the Third Man?

22:15.000 --> 22:17.336
You can almost hear
the footsteps.

22:17.336 --> 22:21.173
What you said.
About Chuck showing who he is.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.716
It fucking happened.

22:22.716 --> 22:23.967
Tell me.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.260
The three of them.

22:25.260 --> 22:26.636
Him and Ira and Allerd,

22:26.636 --> 22:28.680
they all line up together
and expect what from me?

22:28.680 --> 22:30.098
Obedience? Fealty?

22:30.098 --> 22:32.309
I need the thing, not your
feelings about the thing.

22:32.309 --> 22:34.603
He's got a list of Prince's
private companies.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.271
Investigations
to be announced tomorrow.

22:36.271 --> 22:37.522
There's nothing there.

22:37.522 --> 22:38.940
I may not be voting
for your boss,

22:38.940 --> 22:40.567
but he's as far from a crime

22:40.567 --> 22:43.278
as I am from starring
in a <i>Black Swan</i> remake.

22:43.278 --> 22:44.821
Don't have the dance moves?

22:44.821 --> 22:46.907
My jeté is for shit.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.077
The targets.
And how targeted.

22:53.622 --> 22:54.706
Wow.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.083
I can't stop
these investigations,

22:56.083 --> 22:57.501
or the announcements
that are coming.

22:57.501 --> 22:59.461
I can't stop him.

22:59.461 --> 23:02.464
But I can at least knock the
intended victim out of the way.

23:15.519 --> 23:18.897
So, yeah, I have a source
and some documentation.

23:18.897 --> 23:21.149
I know how Chuck
is gonna attack, and where.

23:21.149 --> 23:24.277
Who's the source?
How close? How good? And who?

23:24.277 --> 23:25.862
Close. All I can say.

23:25.862 --> 23:27.447
Without the specific name,

23:27.447 --> 23:29.574
it's hard for me to put
confidence in the information.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.243
I understand
what you're thinking--

23:31.243 --> 23:33.286
that Chuck might want you
to know he's investigating

23:33.286 --> 23:35.163
to induce a reaction,
but I can't tell you.

23:35.163 --> 23:36.623
For the source's sake.

23:36.623 --> 23:39.543
Nice of you to protect
Amanda Torre from SDNY.

23:41.336 --> 23:42.796
Shit.

23:42.796 --> 23:45.507
So those footsteps.
I wasn't just hearing things.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.386
Smart. Trust no one.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.513
I don't even know
who they're tracking or when.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.056
I just look
at what they send me.

23:53.056 --> 23:55.100
It's that same prudence
that makes me suggest

23:55.100 --> 23:58.395
you sell out your positions
even in these private companies.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.188
All your private
equity positions.

24:00.188 --> 24:01.523
Unless he wants us to do that.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.108
Unless that won't be enough.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.944
It all depends on how many steps
from the idiot he thinks I am,

24:05.944 --> 24:08.613
and he presumes
I think he is.

24:10.532 --> 24:11.825
I-I need a whiteboard.

24:11.825 --> 24:13.660
Dunlop just texted me, Mike.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.287
She needs to push your dinner.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.873
- Tomorrow?
-"Heading back home.

24:17.873 --> 24:20.000
Next trip should be soon."

24:28.675 --> 24:30.093
Herbert Yardley.
Know the name?

24:30.093 --> 24:31.511
WWII codebreaker.

24:31.511 --> 24:36.266
And wrote the first
great poker strategy book.

24:36.266 --> 24:39.269
In it, he kind of invents
game theory.

24:39.269 --> 24:42.022
Now the example we use to figure
this out is the quarterback,

24:42.022 --> 24:44.316
because in order
to defend against him,

24:44.316 --> 24:47.486
you need to figure out
how many steps removed

24:47.486 --> 24:49.321
from the idiot he is.

24:49.321 --> 24:52.407
An idiot quarterback
looks directly

24:52.407 --> 24:54.451
at the man he throws to.

24:54.451 --> 24:57.245
Now, what do you do if you're
the middle linebacker, Kate?

24:57.245 --> 24:59.956
Jump into the path of the ball,
just go where he's looking

24:59.956 --> 25:01.333
and intercept the pass.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.751
And if he's one step removed,

25:02.751 --> 25:07.214
if he looks left
but throws right each time.

25:07.214 --> 25:09.549
- Also easy to defend.
- Sure.

25:09.549 --> 25:11.968
You go to the opposite of his
eyes and intercept the pass.

25:11.968 --> 25:13.428
But-- and this
is where the idea

25:13.428 --> 25:15.972
of un-exploitable play
comes from--

25:15.972 --> 25:17.807
if he knows you're running
this thought process,

25:17.807 --> 25:20.685
he can figure how many steps
removed you think he is,

25:20.685 --> 25:24.147
and he can go eight
or nine steps further out.

25:24.147 --> 25:27.359
Chuck is going to announce
an investigation...

25:28.276 --> 25:29.402
so I sell.

25:29.402 --> 25:32.906
But he wants me to know,
so I don't sell.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.409
But he knows I know,

25:36.409 --> 25:38.745
so he doesn't really
want me to sell.

25:38.745 --> 25:40.539
On and on.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.085
Now the question is,

25:45.085 --> 25:47.587
how many degrees from the idiot
does he think I am?

25:47.587 --> 25:49.464
How many is he?

25:49.464 --> 25:51.675
That's what I need
to figure, right?

25:53.635 --> 25:55.136
No.

25:58.431 --> 26:00.392
Good. Good.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.019
That's what he wants me
spending my time on.

26:03.019 --> 26:06.189
Sorting out the financial attack
he and Axe are planning.

26:06.189 --> 26:08.692
He wants all my focus
on that flank,

26:08.692 --> 26:11.444
ignoring the front where the war
is really taking place.

26:13.196 --> 26:15.365
Shoot.
Get back to Dunlop.

26:15.365 --> 26:16.825
Tell her to be
at my house tonight

26:16.825 --> 26:18.577
after whatever she's doing.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.287
Demand it.

26:20.287 --> 26:23.623
She doesn't leave the isle
of Manhattan before we meet.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.001
That's what you counted on.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.211
Getting me all caught up
in your frontal attack

26:28.211 --> 26:29.921
so I'd miss the real play:

26:29.921 --> 26:32.507
winning Governor Dunlop
and her support.

26:32.507 --> 26:33.842
- Huh.
- But you see,

26:33.842 --> 26:36.845
I remembered what was most
important to me:

26:36.845 --> 26:39.514
the presidency,
and how to get there.

26:39.514 --> 26:42.225
I think you know she hasn't
made her announcement yet.

26:42.225 --> 26:45.520
No, but I think I know
what it's gonna be.

26:45.520 --> 26:46.938
Do you?

26:46.938 --> 26:49.482
Well, then you should know
what I did yesterday, Mike.

27:03.538 --> 27:05.999
So this is where
the magic happens.

27:05.999 --> 27:09.628
Never could make the elephant
disappear when it came to you.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.338
But yeah,
this is the place.

27:11.338 --> 27:14.174
Though as you know,
the usual weapons of this office

27:14.174 --> 27:18.261
are also coming up short
against Prince.

27:19.346 --> 27:21.306
All right, well,
let's get into it.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.683
Do your thing, Wend.

27:23.683 --> 27:25.977
We're dealing with an ambitious,

27:25.977 --> 27:28.355
competitive, confident,

27:28.355 --> 27:31.858
charismatic, socially conscious
strategic thinker

27:31.858 --> 27:34.986
with high emotional intelligence
and deep resources.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.404
Jeez, it's a wonder
I even thought

27:36.404 --> 27:37.906
to come back for this fight.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.699
Or even why I get out of bed
in the morning.

27:39.699 --> 27:41.576
But he's morally complex,

27:41.576 --> 27:44.037
which means he likes to think
he's more ethical

27:44.037 --> 27:45.497
than those around him.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.082
And he is not immune
from engaging

27:47.082 --> 27:48.875
in questionable tactics
to achieve his goals.

27:48.875 --> 27:52.504
That is a slippery slope,
and one place he can be hit.

27:52.504 --> 27:56.549
And he believes in his own
infallibility above all else.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.635
Something you fell prey to

27:58.635 --> 28:00.095
that last time you tangled
with the man.

28:00.095 --> 28:02.639
I thought my play
was un-exploitable.

28:02.639 --> 28:05.642
Until you found out that any
approach can be exploited

28:05.642 --> 28:07.102
if it becomes known.

28:08.269 --> 28:10.397
He's going to cash
with everything.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.981
Whole Street's
talking about it.

28:11.981 --> 28:13.775
It's untenable.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.735
He's probably looking
for some sort of hard reset

28:15.735 --> 28:18.113
to make sure we're not already
in his holdings.

28:18.113 --> 28:19.864
He'll have to buy back in fast.

28:19.864 --> 28:23.284
Nobody wants to pay him
two and twenty to sit in cash.

28:23.284 --> 28:24.661
How long does he have?

28:24.661 --> 28:26.371
A few days, max.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.998
He'll try to massage
his investors, his employees,

28:28.998 --> 28:30.458
but he smells the attack.

28:30.458 --> 28:31.835
He knows we want to hurt him.

28:31.835 --> 28:33.670
Hurt? No. Annihilate.

28:33.670 --> 28:36.381
Send his holdings up
in a mushroom cloud.

28:37.507 --> 28:39.050
You got a way
to separate his cash

28:39.050 --> 28:40.635
from all the people
that work there for him

28:40.635 --> 28:42.637
before you A-bomb his shit?

28:42.637 --> 28:44.973
You know, the ones you told me
you couldn't abandon

28:44.973 --> 28:46.433
and had to protect,

28:46.433 --> 28:48.143
so staying in London
was out for you.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.478
Those people?

28:54.357 --> 28:55.483
There is no way.

28:55.483 --> 28:57.986
Price of doing business here.

28:58.778 --> 29:00.947
So who wins when Prince loses?

29:02.323 --> 29:03.783
The country.

29:03.783 --> 29:05.034
The world.

29:05.034 --> 29:07.287
Like it, don't love it.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.999
All right,
let's shift venues

29:10.999 --> 29:13.752
before your staff come
into work and clock I'm here.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.587
You need someplace
to work out of?

29:15.587 --> 29:17.464
I'm covered, Charles.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.519
Uh, yeah,
I'd say you're covered.

29:31.519 --> 29:32.979
It'll do for now.

29:32.979 --> 29:35.356
Still have my eye on a different
space for the long haul.

29:35.356 --> 29:36.733
Sure.

29:38.735 --> 29:39.861
Strength report.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.196
I think, from what I know,

29:41.196 --> 29:42.864
Prince is gonna try
to lock up Dunlop.

29:42.864 --> 29:44.115
But she's not easy.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.325
We have to set it up

29:45.325 --> 29:46.576
so she does what we want.

29:46.576 --> 29:48.536
Bobby, you need to reach Dunlop.

29:48.536 --> 29:49.996
Offer her whatever you can.

29:49.996 --> 29:51.748
Make sure she doesn't do
the wrong thing.

29:51.748 --> 29:54.542
And what is the overall plan
at the moment?

29:54.542 --> 29:57.045
Bankrupt Prince,
drain the portfolio,

29:57.045 --> 29:58.797
use whatever we know
about the man

29:58.797 --> 30:01.049
and can glean
to set it up.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.718
You do know-- He does know
our money's in there too?

30:03.718 --> 30:05.804
Like I told them:
Like it, don't love it.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.598
Pitched Dollar Bill and Victor.
Pass from each.

30:08.598 --> 30:09.974
They love you, but...

30:09.974 --> 30:11.267
That's the smart move.

30:11.267 --> 30:12.894
Their money's
holding them hostage.

30:12.894 --> 30:15.230
Most people aren't crazy
like you, Taylor.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.815
- And Ben and Tuk?
- Too emotional for them.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.233
The whole thing.
They wouldn't meet.

30:18.233 --> 30:19.692
They knew if they saw me,
especially you,

30:19.692 --> 30:21.820
they'd just go in for a hug
and never let go.

30:21.820 --> 30:24.489
Dumb move.
They'll be canned by now.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.033
You may be aware
that the guillotine

30:27.033 --> 30:29.744
was originally conceived
and fashioned

30:29.744 --> 30:32.121
by Dr. Joseph-Ignace Guillotin

30:32.121 --> 30:35.166
as a more humane means
of execution.

30:35.166 --> 30:36.668
Unaware.

30:36.668 --> 30:39.546
But since we've already been
decapitated, sans the humanity--

30:39.546 --> 30:42.423
Lightning quick.

30:42.423 --> 30:45.927
Less likely to be botched
than steel or scimitar.

30:45.927 --> 30:47.595
So, no severance package?

30:51.099 --> 30:52.392
So, yes severance package?

30:52.392 --> 30:56.187
Consider the mouton
to have fallen.

30:56.187 --> 30:58.273
Detailed data sheets

30:58.273 --> 31:00.400
of every farthing
you have tied up in this fund.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.318
Also known
as what you stand to lose

31:02.318 --> 31:04.946
should you use or discuss
or otherwise bandy about

31:04.946 --> 31:06.614
anything you have learned
about trades

31:06.614 --> 31:08.241
and business practices here.

31:08.241 --> 31:10.326
You know we have
aggressive non-competes,

31:10.326 --> 31:11.661
unless you think
we're gonna bring

31:11.661 --> 31:13.830
our inside knowledge
to Starbucks.

31:13.830 --> 31:15.790
Only place on the Street
we can still work.

31:15.790 --> 31:18.418
You have aggressive
non-disparagement clauses too.

31:18.418 --> 31:21.129
Should you wind up
in said Starbucks,

31:21.129 --> 31:22.714
you had better be praising
Mike Prince

31:22.714 --> 31:24.007
for the chance to quaff

31:24.007 --> 31:27.135
their barely potable
breakfast blend.

31:29.596 --> 31:31.431
Key cards, please.

31:34.934 --> 31:36.978
And your Nimbus rings.

31:48.364 --> 31:50.658
Find out how long
their non-competes are.

31:51.993 --> 31:53.494
I've got to make
a call.

31:55.955 --> 31:57.999
See, I wasn't exactly
caught unawares

31:57.999 --> 32:00.209
by any of your
highlight reel plays.

32:00.209 --> 32:02.295
<i>Governor,
don't meet with Michael Prince</i>

32:02.295 --> 32:03.671
until you sit with me.

32:03.671 --> 32:06.007
Mr. Axelrod,
are we sharing calendars now?

32:06.007 --> 32:08.009
What makes you think I'm
meeting with Michael Prince?

32:08.009 --> 32:09.802
You're the key piece.

32:09.802 --> 32:11.554
<i>Anyone smart can see it.</i>

32:11.554 --> 32:14.182
And Mike Prince, for all
his flaws, is at least that.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.100
We all know you're
in New York. Come on.

32:16.100 --> 32:19.020
All right, look,

32:19.020 --> 32:21.689
I took the call because
you're an influential man.

32:21.689 --> 32:23.733
I like that you get
straight to the punch.

32:23.733 --> 32:25.652
That's my style. So I will.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.404
Even if you max out
your contributions

32:28.404 --> 32:32.450
and get all your fancy friends
to do the same...

32:32.450 --> 32:35.703
not sure the association
is what I need right now.

32:37.038 --> 32:38.456
I'm no Wall Street fancy pants,

32:38.456 --> 32:40.416
so I don't see
how you can help.

32:40.416 --> 32:42.919
And I sure don't see
any value in meeting.

32:42.919 --> 32:44.963
Oh, I think there is.

32:44.963 --> 32:48.049
Whatever you have on
with Prince, cancel it.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.425
Postpone it at least,

32:49.425 --> 32:52.011
and then meet with me
so I can show you.

32:54.222 --> 32:57.308
<i>La-da-da
Da-da-da</i>

32:57.308 --> 32:59.811
- I'm gonna go check on the--
- Yeah, check on that.

33:04.190 --> 33:05.608
How we doing, guys?

33:05.608 --> 33:07.610
We're doing good, thanks.

33:07.610 --> 33:09.737
Fantastic, Tommy.

33:09.737 --> 33:11.531
I'm liking
this new red.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.074
It's a good one.

33:14.575 --> 33:17.412
- All right, enjoy, everybody.
- Thank you so much.

33:17.412 --> 33:19.205
<i>Salut,</i> gentlemen.

33:19.205 --> 33:20.623
<i>Salut.</i> Cheers.

33:20.623 --> 33:22.625
<i>Salut.</i> Enjoy your dinner.

33:25.211 --> 33:26.713
I don't impress easily,

33:26.713 --> 33:28.297
but Rao's?

33:28.297 --> 33:29.465
All alone?

33:29.465 --> 33:31.759
Yeah, well,
these are my people.

33:31.759 --> 33:33.219
It can't be that simple.

33:33.219 --> 33:35.847
I've been asked here before
by my biggest donors,

33:35.847 --> 33:38.850
richest people in the world
offering to bring me.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.727
But I was never in town

33:40.727 --> 33:42.687
on the third Tuesday
of the month,

33:42.687 --> 33:44.272
or whenever they had
their regular table.

33:44.272 --> 33:48.109
And, look,
you've got the whole place.

33:48.109 --> 33:50.278
Can't even imagine the cost.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.738
Nah. It ain't about that.

33:52.613 --> 33:54.032
Or net worth.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.199
You need to be a person.

33:55.199 --> 33:57.285
And have grip with Ron,

33:57.285 --> 33:59.620
and Frank Jr., Joe, Dino.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.581
They need to be your friends.

34:01.581 --> 34:03.708
Then you need to be sure
not to act like an asshole.

34:05.001 --> 34:08.796
Oh, this is one hell
of a meatball. Good God.

34:08.796 --> 34:10.965
Well, that's the thing,
though, isn't it?

34:11.841 --> 34:13.634
Riding with me.

34:13.634 --> 34:15.011
What do they say?

34:15.011 --> 34:17.263
The one thing
you will never regret

34:17.263 --> 34:19.640
spending money or time on

34:19.640 --> 34:21.684
is a great experience.

34:21.684 --> 34:24.103
A memorable time.

34:24.854 --> 34:26.189
That's what I provide.

34:26.189 --> 34:29.484
When I look at you,
I look at your appeal,

34:29.484 --> 34:30.651
your infrastructure.

34:30.651 --> 34:32.987
The memorable experience
I want to provide

34:32.987 --> 34:34.489
is a trip to the White House.

34:34.489 --> 34:37.033
That would be one hell
of a memorable one.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.785
Mm-hmm. Then work with me.

34:38.785 --> 34:42.705
Respond to Prince
on your timeline, on mine,

34:42.705 --> 34:45.458
on the way we decide
to do together.

34:45.458 --> 34:46.959
And that's where this ends up.

34:46.959 --> 34:48.795
I'll put you
on top in the race,

34:48.795 --> 34:51.506
but you got to do it
the way I lay it out.

34:53.424 --> 34:56.969
This is one hell of
a meatball, like I said.

34:56.969 --> 35:02.141
But it's a long way from there
to the presidency.

35:02.725 --> 35:05.144
What kind of real guarantees
can you make me?

35:05.144 --> 35:06.729
Well, that's a fair question.

35:06.729 --> 35:07.939
What's he offered?

35:07.939 --> 35:09.482
You asked me
to cancel the meeting,

35:09.482 --> 35:10.900
so I don't know
where he'll start.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.653
Probably cabinet positions.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.029
But we all know
where it'll end up.

35:15.029 --> 35:16.280
Then let me help you

35:16.280 --> 35:18.741
think through
all the ramifications.

35:20.409 --> 35:21.702
Axe, you're impressive.

35:21.702 --> 35:23.830
This is impressive.

35:23.830 --> 35:26.332
But this is something I've
worked my whole life for.

35:26.332 --> 35:29.919
Then don't barter that dream
to a guy so transactional

35:29.919 --> 35:32.463
he'll sell VP for your support.

35:32.463 --> 35:35.800
And the truth is, you shouldn't
even settle for that.

35:38.427 --> 35:39.887
Here we go.

35:39.887 --> 35:41.639
- Here's the veal parm.
- Thanks, Dino.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.182
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

35:44.350 --> 35:46.352
So, aside from the best veal
in the city,

35:46.352 --> 35:48.521
what can you really offer me?

36:13.212 --> 36:14.630
You're really doing it.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.009
Vagabonding.

36:18.009 --> 36:20.219
Night flight
to the West Coast?

36:20.219 --> 36:22.513
Or are you going the other way,
Prague or Stockholm?

36:22.513 --> 36:23.764
Morocco, baby.

36:23.764 --> 36:25.683
<i>Sheltering Sky</i> time.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.518
Smoking kief.

36:27.518 --> 36:28.728
Do you smoke it?

36:28.728 --> 36:30.688
I don't know, do you?
Or chew it.

36:31.647 --> 36:33.608
Anyway, North Africa,

36:33.608 --> 36:35.151
then the Middle East,

36:35.151 --> 36:36.360
then I don't know where.

36:36.360 --> 36:37.945
Good choice. All of it.

36:37.945 --> 36:39.322
So, what's the plan?

36:39.322 --> 36:40.573
Go until the money runs out?

36:40.573 --> 36:41.991
Because I've checked
and saw how much

36:41.991 --> 36:43.826
you've slowly been
pulling out of the fund.

36:43.826 --> 36:46.704
- Unlike the rest of us.
- Yeah, pretty much.

36:46.704 --> 36:48.539
Time for something else.

36:48.539 --> 36:50.041
Maybe find myself some

36:50.041 --> 36:52.210
Kim Gordon-Thurston Moore
type heat,

36:52.210 --> 36:55.421
but with a better ending,
you know?

36:55.421 --> 36:57.965
Not gonna find that
at the firm.

36:57.965 --> 36:59.926
No, you're not.

37:01.093 --> 37:03.721
Wait, you're not here
to try to stop me?

37:04.680 --> 37:05.932
I'm glad you're going,

37:05.932 --> 37:07.266
but you left me that book.

37:07.266 --> 37:09.227
That was an invitation
to say goodbye.

37:11.187 --> 37:14.398
I can't hug you
with this backpack on.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.737
Thank you for bringing me in.
For teaching me.

37:19.737 --> 37:22.073
- I could have never--
- Shh.

37:44.011 --> 37:46.806
Two billionaires
want to take me to prom,

37:46.806 --> 37:49.809
and neither of them are getting
me jazzed about the after-party.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.727
- Uh-huh.
- So,

37:51.727 --> 37:53.729
ya-fucking-hoo to me.

37:53.729 --> 37:55.690
Well, I have to think

37:55.690 --> 37:58.442
if there was nothing that
Axe said worth considering,

37:58.442 --> 37:59.944
you wouldn't
have come to me.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.862
Prince is too smooth.

38:01.862 --> 38:04.782
Too confident.
He's built different.

38:05.866 --> 38:07.618
It's like he ate
the Great Man Theory

38:07.618 --> 38:08.786
and asked for seconds.

38:08.786 --> 38:11.455
Well, no argument there.

38:11.455 --> 38:13.207
But I'm not seeing
enough evidence

38:13.207 --> 38:15.459
your guy is that different.

38:15.459 --> 38:16.877
Which is why I am here.

38:16.877 --> 38:19.213
And I am grateful you are, Governor.

38:19.213 --> 38:20.756
I don't need gratitude.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.759
I need clarity.

38:26.012 --> 38:27.221
Clarity.

38:27.221 --> 38:28.597
Okay.

38:28.597 --> 38:33.436
Well, Bobby Axelrod
doesn't lie to himself.

38:34.478 --> 38:36.272
If he says he's gonna do
something monstrous,

38:36.272 --> 38:37.648
that's what he does.

38:37.648 --> 38:40.401
And that's what he is.

38:40.401 --> 38:41.944
A self-aware monster.

38:41.944 --> 38:44.447
If he says we can get you
to the White House,

38:44.447 --> 38:45.990
it's not to serve his ego.

38:45.990 --> 38:48.117
It is simply the truth.

38:49.201 --> 38:50.578
Hmm.

38:50.578 --> 38:53.247
An honest cocky son of a bitch.

38:53.247 --> 38:55.374
And there's your difference.

38:55.374 --> 38:58.044
Axe has ego,
and doesn't pretend otherwise.

38:58.044 --> 39:01.797
Prince wants you to believe
he is the benevolent,

39:01.797 --> 39:04.175
humble servant
of the greater good.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.052
A selfless billionaire.

39:06.052 --> 39:07.762
Hmm. Sounds like a punch line.

39:07.762 --> 39:10.639
If success in politics
is the ability to seem sincere

39:10.639 --> 39:13.142
when no sincerity
actually exists,

39:13.142 --> 39:17.813
then Prince is
the ultimate politician.

39:17.813 --> 39:20.107
I hear what you're
telling me. I do.

39:20.107 --> 39:23.152
But see,
you just said it right there.

39:23.152 --> 39:25.446
One of them is in politics,

39:25.446 --> 39:26.781
and that's the game I'm in.

39:26.781 --> 39:30.701
And that's the game
I want you to win.

39:30.701 --> 39:32.620
Long term.

39:32.620 --> 39:36.123
And I really know
how you can get this done.

39:36.123 --> 39:40.252
It is the one thing on Earth
I am truly elite at.

39:42.671 --> 39:44.548
Walk me through it, then.

39:48.344 --> 39:51.597
So, you see, we put up
some roadblocks of our own.

39:51.597 --> 39:54.683
I can see why you feel good
about this, Axe. I can.

39:54.683 --> 39:56.769
But there's one beat
I left out of my own story.

39:56.769 --> 40:01.148
I did, you see, end up having
my own meeting with Dunlop.

40:01.148 --> 40:04.402
Governor, now that
you've met all over town,

40:04.402 --> 40:07.363
I'm glad you decided
to find time for me.

40:07.363 --> 40:09.407
Well, I wanted to make you
the last meeting,

40:09.407 --> 40:12.993
so I wouldn't have to tell you
that I'd have to think about it.

40:12.993 --> 40:15.037
- Either way.
- Considerate.

40:16.997 --> 40:18.874
Sure. That's what it is.

40:18.874 --> 40:20.668
As I am considerate
of those I vanquish.

40:20.668 --> 40:23.546
No reason to pull
a full Angel Reese.

40:23.546 --> 40:26.090
I like her spunk and fire.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.800
Of course you do.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.593
When I played,
I was more in the

40:29.593 --> 40:32.221
"just place the ball on the
baseline after you score" mode.

40:32.221 --> 40:34.765
That's what went in Indiana
in the '90s.

40:36.142 --> 40:37.393
Different world now.

40:37.393 --> 40:38.936
Certain things,
certain values,

40:38.936 --> 40:40.229
should remain constant.

40:40.229 --> 40:42.857
We aren't playing
to an audience, Mike.

40:42.857 --> 40:44.817
What can you offer me?

40:47.611 --> 40:49.947
She is tough.

40:49.947 --> 40:51.365
And you definitely got to her.

40:51.365 --> 40:53.284
Sorry to make it so difficult.

40:53.284 --> 40:54.702
Yeah.

40:54.702 --> 40:57.121
Maybe we've each made it
as difficult for the other

40:57.121 --> 40:58.706
as we should.

40:58.706 --> 41:01.625
Maybe we try
a different mode now.

41:02.835 --> 41:04.962
Say the thing
you're dancing around.

41:04.962 --> 41:07.840
It's time to put
this conflict to rest.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.550
By way of peace talks.

41:10.342 --> 41:12.344
Let's call them in.

41:12.344 --> 41:14.054
All of them.

41:16.891 --> 41:19.018
You believe we've got
Dunlop where you want her?

41:19.018 --> 41:21.979
I believe she'll do exactly
what we need her to.

41:30.070 --> 41:34.241
In the old-timey thing,
the predominant king would, say,

41:34.241 --> 41:37.870
surrender his Northern troops,
give back some lands.

41:37.870 --> 41:39.246
Because he knew
if the war went on,

41:39.246 --> 41:41.373
even in victory,
it would be Pyrrhic...

41:42.458 --> 41:44.543
and that he could prevent
further bloodshed

41:44.543 --> 41:47.171
and loss on all sides
by doing so.

41:47.171 --> 41:49.340
And what do
great presidents do?

41:50.966 --> 41:53.886
Great presidents,
all great leaders, do the same.

41:53.886 --> 41:56.055
Dictate peace
through strength.

41:56.055 --> 41:59.683
Great presidents?
Dreams of fucking grandeur.

41:59.683 --> 42:01.936
They should deal with traitors
harshly before that peace.

42:01.936 --> 42:03.854
Damn right they should.
You should, Mike.

42:03.854 --> 42:05.940
Yeah, that way you'll
finally be in charge,

42:05.940 --> 42:08.359
all by yourself, just like
you wanted from the start.

42:08.359 --> 42:09.902
That's what you think
is driving him?

42:09.902 --> 42:12.029
That,
or the nose-to-ass parades

42:12.029 --> 42:14.031
you've been
such a prominent part of.

42:14.031 --> 42:15.324
Stockyard comment
from a man

42:15.324 --> 42:16.575
whose mind is always
in the trough.

42:16.575 --> 42:17.952
You're doing
a lot of talking

42:17.952 --> 42:19.787
about strength, Mike.

42:20.871 --> 42:22.456
But only the king
with the extra armies

42:22.456 --> 42:24.416
or allies or siege artillery,

42:24.416 --> 42:25.834
the fucking dreadnought
weapons--

42:25.834 --> 42:27.044
Those are the nukes

42:27.044 --> 42:28.796
he's so eager
to play around with.

42:28.796 --> 42:30.673
Only the king with all that

42:30.673 --> 42:32.466
had the juice to dictate terms.

42:32.466 --> 42:34.510
But you?

42:34.510 --> 42:37.096
You just look like
another run-of-the-mill usurper

42:37.096 --> 42:38.931
scrapping for turf in this room.

42:38.931 --> 42:40.307
Hear, hear.

42:40.307 --> 42:41.642
So you think.

42:41.642 --> 42:43.644
Now, my information
has Governor Dunlop

42:43.644 --> 42:46.939
reaffirming her own candidacy
for president tonight,

42:46.939 --> 42:49.942
with a big machine
and a lot of backing behind her.

42:49.942 --> 42:54.822
Mine too, which means you'll be
in a dogfight for the next year.

42:56.115 --> 42:58.117
I guess we'll soon see.

43:00.828 --> 43:02.246
It's time.

43:10.921 --> 43:13.048
Oh, fuck.

43:20.806 --> 43:22.308
Hello, everyone.

43:22.308 --> 43:24.727
No intros needed.
You know who I am,

43:24.727 --> 43:28.314
and I know those of you
it's important to know.

43:28.314 --> 43:32.443
It's been a real kick doing
the roundy-round with you all.

43:34.320 --> 43:36.071
But I've made my decision...

43:39.742 --> 43:41.619
to not only throw my support

43:41.619 --> 43:44.204
behind our next president,
Mike Prince,

43:44.204 --> 43:46.707
but to become his partner.

43:49.084 --> 43:51.170
His vice president.

43:51.170 --> 43:54.089
For the good of our country
and the whole world.

43:54.089 --> 43:55.674
Yeah. Like I said.

43:55.674 --> 43:58.636
At least
you got a decent price.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.137
Governor, thank you.

44:00.137 --> 44:01.847
I'll meet up
with you shortly.

44:09.438 --> 44:11.106
Now, I know what that's
got to feel like.

44:11.106 --> 44:13.817
And that the tendency
for you, and for me,

44:13.817 --> 44:16.570
is to go on trying
to destroy each other.

44:16.570 --> 44:18.489
But it'll cost both sides,

44:18.489 --> 44:21.617
even though it's pretty clear
who'll win out here.

44:23.202 --> 44:25.913
Which is why I propose
a peace treaty

44:25.913 --> 44:28.040
between our warring factions.

44:28.040 --> 44:31.043
- And what would that look like?
- Like this:

44:31.043 --> 44:32.419
You, jointly and separately,

44:32.419 --> 44:35.172
will cease all further
and future attacks on me,

44:35.172 --> 44:37.174
my name, my candidacy,

44:37.174 --> 44:39.635
my personal life
and my business interests,

44:39.635 --> 44:41.428
which include
my remaining personnel,

44:41.428 --> 44:42.763
which no longer includes anyone

44:42.763 --> 44:44.181
on that side of the table,
by the way.

44:44.181 --> 44:45.974
In return, I will do the same,

44:45.974 --> 44:47.351
and when I become president,

44:47.351 --> 44:49.561
I pledge not to use
any government resources

44:49.561 --> 44:53.482
to persecute, prosecute,
fire or bankrupt any of you.

44:56.527 --> 45:00.698
Should we jump ahead past
all the writhing and invective

45:00.698 --> 45:02.866
to the place where we all admit
this is the best deal

45:02.866 --> 45:04.702
you're gonna get?

45:15.504 --> 45:16.880
Good.

45:24.972 --> 45:29.852
<i>We skipped
The light fandango</i>

45:32.187 --> 45:34.106
So, well, there's that.

45:36.859 --> 45:38.986
Yeah. There it is.

45:38.986 --> 45:41.530
<i>I was feeling
Kind of seasick</i>

45:43.198 --> 45:44.616
Yes.

45:45.701 --> 45:47.035
Yes.

45:48.203 --> 45:49.538
Okay.

45:52.583 --> 45:53.834
That was the call.

45:53.834 --> 45:55.461
You're on the briefings, Mike.

45:56.670 --> 45:58.255
First one is tomorrow.

45:59.381 --> 46:00.799
Yeah.

46:01.884 --> 46:04.011
So, yes, that's it, then.

46:04.011 --> 46:07.639
<i>When we called out
For another drink</i>

46:07.639 --> 46:09.349
All conditions satisfied.

46:10.934 --> 46:13.896
<i>The waiter brought a tray</i>

46:15.230 --> 46:16.607
Tomorrow, at the open,

46:16.607 --> 46:18.317
put the money to work
as instructed.

46:18.317 --> 46:19.777
Nothing heroic.

46:19.777 --> 46:23.071
Prioritize return of capital,
not return on capital.

46:23.071 --> 46:24.281
You got it, Cap'.

46:24.281 --> 46:25.949
Where's the briefing?
White House?

46:25.949 --> 46:28.327
No.
We're going to Camp David.

46:28.327 --> 46:30.412
That's it.

46:30.412 --> 46:31.872
You're minted.

46:32.915 --> 46:34.750
Boom.

46:34.750 --> 46:36.293
You can say that again.

46:36.293 --> 46:38.003
Boom.

46:39.213 --> 46:41.256
<i>...Shade of pale</i>

47:10.619 --> 47:15.290
<i>She said
"There is no reason"</i>

47:16.875 --> 47:20.295
<i>"And the truth
Is plain to see"</i>
