WEBVTT

00:03.921 --> 00:05.714
[Axe]<i> Previously on</i> Billions.

00:05.756 --> 00:07.675
It needs to be legalized,

00:05.756 --> 00:07.675
and federally.

00:07.716 --> 00:09.050
Yeah, right on, hop-head.

00:09.092 --> 00:10.761
My two enemies have linked up.

00:10.803 --> 00:13.305
Whatever he's goin' after,

00:10.803 --> 00:13.305
I'm gonna take it.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.933
This is about control

00:13.347 --> 00:15.933
over me one last time.

00:15.975 --> 00:18.018
D'you want to be done?

00:15.975 --> 00:18.018
Then let's be done.

00:18.059 --> 00:20.020
I sold to Axe.

00:20.061 --> 00:23.106
I have to share some shit that's

00:20.061 --> 00:23.106
making me feel seriously awk.

00:23.148 --> 00:25.024
Taylor went behind Axe's back

00:23.148 --> 00:25.024
to lay off the cannabis deal

00:25.066 --> 00:25.943
to a third party.

00:25.985 --> 00:27.569
Whoa, fuck. Who?

00:27.611 --> 00:29.112
[Wendy]<i> Lawrence Boyd.</i>

00:29.154 --> 00:30.781
You can't really say

00:29.154 --> 00:30.781
you're playing

00:30.823 --> 00:32.616
unless you're willing

00:30.823 --> 00:32.616
to put your highest value

00:32.658 --> 00:34.409
<i>pieces on the board.</i>

00:34.451 --> 00:36.161
[Axe]<i> My country house.</i>

00:34.451 --> 00:36.161
<i>It is now your house.</i>

00:36.203 --> 00:38.038
<i>Just cross out</i>

00:36.203 --> 00:38.038
<i>Prince's name in the deal</i>

00:38.079 --> 00:39.748
<i>and put mine in.</i>

00:39.790 --> 00:41.709
<i>And I will use</i>

00:39.790 --> 00:41.709
<i>his due diligence as my own.</i>

00:41.750 --> 00:43.168
Fuck yeah!

00:43.210 --> 00:45.004
He actually closed

00:43.210 --> 00:45.004
on that money.

00:45.044 --> 00:46.588
Time to arrest Winslow.

00:46.630 --> 00:48.924
You found the one CEO who also

00:46.630 --> 00:48.924
happened to be running

00:48.966 --> 00:50.718
a criminal enterprise.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.761
Just another drug dealer

00:50.759 --> 00:52.761
moving major weight.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.304
Douse the fucking smokes. Now!

00:54.346 --> 00:56.348
Sometime

00:54.346 --> 00:56.348
in the next 24 hours,

00:56.390 --> 00:58.058
they believe they'll

00:56.390 --> 00:58.058
have you in custody.

00:58.099 --> 01:00.561
And they don't believe

00:58.099 --> 01:00.561
you have a way out this time.

01:00.602 --> 01:01.687
What do you want us to do?

01:01.729 --> 01:03.856
I have no fucking idea.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.390
He here? Up in his office?

01:38.432 --> 01:40.267
Where else he gonna be?

01:40.308 --> 01:42.436
It is his office, right?

01:44.605 --> 01:45.731
For now.

01:55.950 --> 01:58.159
So I finally got a clean test.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.745
Just in time for this.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.288
Worst-case it for me.

02:01.329 --> 02:02.915
No point in that.

02:02.957 --> 02:04.083
We need to mount a vigorous--

02:04.124 --> 02:06.043
Worst-case it.

02:06.085 --> 02:08.045
You want to talk

02:06.085 --> 02:08.045
worst-case scenarios?

02:08.087 --> 02:11.799
Okay. But it'll be

02:08.087 --> 02:11.799
a mood killer.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.717
It's hard to kill

02:11.840 --> 02:13.717
what's already dead, Orrin.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.010
[Orrin] Fair.

02:15.052 --> 02:17.012
Okay. Worst case is

02:17.054 --> 02:19.807
the NYAG has you

02:17.054 --> 02:19.807
on a pu-pu platter

02:19.848 --> 02:21.892
of violations related

02:19.848 --> 02:21.892
to Winslow's arrest.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.727
As the head of a bank,

02:23.769 --> 02:26.021
it is your

02:23.769 --> 02:26.021
fiduciary responsibility

02:26.063 --> 02:27.648
to know your

02:26.063 --> 02:27.648
customer's business--

02:27.689 --> 02:29.024
the fact that

02:27.689 --> 02:29.024
she was selling

02:29.066 --> 02:30.400
and processing,

02:29.066 --> 02:30.400
through Axe Bank,

02:30.442 --> 02:31.860
the proceeds of

02:30.442 --> 02:31.860
illegal marijuana.

02:31.902 --> 02:34.529
So... I'm the farmer

02:31.902 --> 02:34.529
in the fucking dell.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.239
Right in the center

02:34.571 --> 02:36.239
of the circle.

02:36.281 --> 02:39.034
Worse, Rhoades can work

02:36.281 --> 02:39.034
with the Manhattan DA

02:39.076 --> 02:42.370
and potentially his old cronies

02:39.076 --> 02:42.370
at the US Attorney's Office

02:42.412 --> 02:44.832
to use that as a gateway

02:42.412 --> 02:44.832
to local, state, and federal

02:44.873 --> 02:46.541
money-laundering violations

02:46.583 --> 02:48.794
and false records

02:46.583 --> 02:48.794
and statements.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.839
They will see you

02:48.836 --> 02:51.839
are more than negligent,

02:51.880 --> 02:55.676
that you willfully ignored

02:51.880 --> 02:55.676
and actually conspired

02:55.717 --> 02:57.218
with the money-laundering.

02:57.260 --> 03:01.389
This will have

02:57.260 --> 03:01.389
real teeth criminally.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.433
Fangs, because they go deep

03:03.475 --> 03:05.144
and suck the life out of you.

03:05.184 --> 03:06.311
Fuck!

03:06.353 --> 03:08.772
How many years am I facing?

03:08.814 --> 03:11.483
We'll pick off the shakier

03:08.814 --> 03:11.483
aspects of the case.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.903
We'll claim there were efforts

03:11.525 --> 03:14.903
made to conceal by Winslow.

03:14.945 --> 03:17.072
We'll work the jury pool

03:14.945 --> 03:17.072
for maximum weakness

03:17.114 --> 03:18.490
and/or affinity.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.408
Worst. Case.

03:20.450 --> 03:21.743
Don't make me say it again.

03:21.785 --> 03:23.495
Now. How many years?

03:23.537 --> 03:26.373
Fifteen, 20, likely,

03:26.414 --> 03:28.042
for you as the chairman.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.626
For the CEO...

03:29.668 --> 03:32.046
But I hardly had

03:29.668 --> 03:32.046
a chance to do anything.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.797
I'm a figurehead.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.797
You know it. I know it.

03:33.839 --> 03:34.923
They definitely know it.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.299
They don't give a shit, Wags.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.885
No, they don't.

03:37.926 --> 03:40.261
Your name's on

03:37.926 --> 03:40.261
the contract as CEO, Wags.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.222
You signed. It was notarized.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.183
So you take the weight

03:42.263 --> 03:44.183
right along with Bobby.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.768
Isn't this,

03:44.224 --> 03:46.768
I don't know, entrapment?

03:46.810 --> 03:49.479
Only if Chuck induced Winslow

03:46.810 --> 03:49.479
to grow the illicit crop.

03:49.521 --> 03:50.939
He likely found out

03:49.521 --> 03:50.939
about this after the fact

03:50.981 --> 03:52.524
and used it.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.652
But whatever he did wrong,

03:52.566 --> 03:55.652
whatever was out of line,

03:55.694 --> 03:57.738
-I will dig into.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.738
-Damn right.

03:57.779 --> 04:01.241
Because believe me, you will

03:57.779 --> 04:01.241
find there's plenty out of line.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.118
This way this guy rolls.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.286
And we need to show the world.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.539
The freezing of your assets,

04:05.328 --> 04:07.539
along with Axe Bank's

04:07.581 --> 04:09.875
and Axe Asset

04:07.581 --> 04:09.875
Management's funds,

04:09.917 --> 04:12.544
will coincide with the issuance

04:09.917 --> 04:12.544
of an arrest warrant on you.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.462
Jesus Christ.

04:14.504 --> 04:18.092
They're gonna arrest

04:14.504 --> 04:18.092
and freeze me too, aren't they?

04:18.133 --> 04:19.885
Motherfucker.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.971
This has been defined as a

04:19.927 --> 04:22.971
worst-case scenario meeting, so,

04:23.013 --> 04:25.390
yes, of course they are, Wags.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.267
Fast or slow...

04:27.308 --> 04:29.103
how do you want to play it?

04:36.276 --> 04:39.529
Let 'em bring it.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.529
Let's get it on.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.740
I'll make it happen as

04:39.571 --> 04:41.740
quickly as possible, then.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.617
I can arrange a surrender,

04:41.782 --> 04:43.617
but you'll have to honor it.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.577
You can't do a runaround

04:43.658 --> 04:45.577
like last time.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.412
Oh, I'll honor it.

04:47.454 --> 04:51.166
More than that, I'm gonna

04:47.454 --> 04:51.166
fight it loudly and publicly.

04:51.208 --> 04:56.337
And once and for all,

04:51.208 --> 04:56.337
because he's in my way now,

04:56.379 --> 04:59.007
on things that are even more

04:56.379 --> 04:59.007
important than business.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.555
So push the timeline

05:02.302 --> 05:05.555
on this, Orrin. Fast.

05:05.597 --> 05:08.058
The arrest, the battle,

05:05.597 --> 05:08.058
the victory.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.560
I will.

05:10.602 --> 05:13.521
I can't handle your

05:10.602 --> 05:13.521
defense myself, Wags.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.565
But I'll put you with a killer.

05:15.607 --> 05:17.651
Talk later in

05:15.607 --> 05:17.651
the ante meridiem, Bobby.

05:21.155 --> 05:22.864
Don't you have

05:21.155 --> 05:22.864
a meeting to attend to?

05:22.906 --> 05:25.575
Seems that should now

05:22.906 --> 05:25.575
become the priority.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.078
Yeah.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.835
Before I go, I need you

05:32.373 --> 05:34.835
to understand something.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.796
I can't.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.923
There's no scenario where

05:37.838 --> 05:39.923
I survive a year in jail,

05:39.965 --> 05:42.050
much less what

05:39.965 --> 05:42.050
we're looking at here.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.468
You're not going to jail.

05:46.847 --> 05:51.226
Well, you might.

05:46.847 --> 05:51.226
It's probable, actually.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.520
But you are a lot stronger

05:51.268 --> 05:53.520
than you think you are.

05:53.561 --> 05:55.438
I know exactly how strong I am,

05:55.480 --> 05:57.691
and it's one notch less

05:55.480 --> 05:57.691
than strong enough for jail.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.318
We'll get with consultants.

05:59.358 --> 06:01.111
I'll have it all

05:59.358 --> 06:01.111
organized for ourselves.

06:01.153 --> 06:02.696
It will suck,

06:02.737 --> 06:05.282
but this is something

06:02.737 --> 06:05.282
you will live through.

06:06.365 --> 06:07.993
Axe,

06:08.035 --> 06:10.037
I worship at your altar, sir.

06:10.078 --> 06:13.748
But I'm telling you

06:10.078 --> 06:13.748
right now, I'm never

06:13.790 --> 06:17.336
walking into a jail cell

06:13.790 --> 06:17.336
with my name on it.

06:17.376 --> 06:21.756
Whatever I have to do,

06:17.376 --> 06:21.756
I'll do it.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.133
I believe you.

06:25.302 --> 06:28.138
Thanks for telling me.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.515
But we are a long way

06:28.180 --> 06:30.515
from walking into a cell.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.662
[door opens]

07:00.254 --> 07:02.839
[sighs]

07:02.881 --> 07:05.424
Not really the kickoff

07:02.881 --> 07:05.424
I envisioned for us.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.637
I wanted a conscious...

07:11.556 --> 07:12.682
a beginning.

07:15.476 --> 07:17.979
I pictured thatched huts

07:15.476 --> 07:17.979
over blue water.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.023
Not courtrooms.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.023
Board shorts.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.942
Not suits and ties.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.527
Yeah, well, that's the thing

07:21.983 --> 07:24.527
about something real.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.446
It doesn't have to look

07:24.569 --> 07:26.446
like a fantasy.

07:26.487 --> 07:29.241
[sighs]

07:26.487 --> 07:29.241
You're still in?

07:29.283 --> 07:31.534
Where am I standing?

07:31.576 --> 07:33.620
Where I always have.

07:33.661 --> 07:35.372
Back-to-back with you,

07:35.414 --> 07:37.582
wading into

07:35.414 --> 07:37.582
the fight together...

07:37.624 --> 07:39.667
[sighs]

07:39.709 --> 07:42.379
...which means getting

07:39.709 --> 07:42.379
back to the office before

07:42.421 --> 07:44.464
all this really breaks.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.341
Deal with the troops

07:44.505 --> 07:46.341
while you...

07:46.383 --> 07:47.759
Yeah.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.637
Start breaking things...

07:47.801 --> 07:50.637
as discussed.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.064
Warrants are imminent.

08:01.106 --> 08:03.942
And I have to say, the idea of

08:01.106 --> 08:03.942
him being surprised like this...

08:03.984 --> 08:05.485
[chuckles]

08:05.526 --> 08:06.945
Oh, there's something

08:05.526 --> 08:06.945
glorious in it.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.196
His plane?

08:08.238 --> 08:09.572
Uh, being watched.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.116
Poised to seize both of them.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.409
Tail numbers have no-fly orders.

08:12.451 --> 08:15.287
-Smart.

08:12.451 --> 08:15.287
-Oh, no circus this time.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.247
The assets are ready to go

08:15.329 --> 08:17.247
into the deep freeze.

08:17.289 --> 08:18.457
So now it's down

08:17.289 --> 08:18.457
to the perp walk.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.167
What do you have planned?

08:20.208 --> 08:22.085
The lefty guns scoop up

08:20.208 --> 08:22.085
while he's about to do a job,

08:22.127 --> 08:23.670
or the shake-and-wake

08:22.127 --> 08:23.670
while he's in bed?

08:23.711 --> 08:25.046
I considered all of it.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.215
But I want it

08:25.088 --> 08:27.215
to be at the office.

08:27.257 --> 08:32.220
I walk him out rear-cuffed

08:27.257 --> 08:32.220
in front of his loyal troops.

08:32.262 --> 08:34.264
Let them see him broken.

08:34.306 --> 08:36.224
Let that break them.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.437
You seem tired.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.437
Late night?

08:40.479 --> 08:42.439
Nah. Just

08:40.479 --> 08:42.439
couldn't sleep

08:42.481 --> 08:43.773
on account of all

08:42.481 --> 08:43.773
the excitement.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.317
What about Winslow?

08:43.815 --> 08:45.317
What are you gonna--

08:45.359 --> 08:46.985
Oh, that's wired.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.987
She's in custody but has been

08:47.027 --> 08:48.987
provided access to a cell phone

08:49.029 --> 08:51.448
in case he calls,

08:49.029 --> 08:51.448
so as not to raise suspicion.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.116
Nice. Seems like

08:51.490 --> 08:53.116
you covered all the--

08:53.158 --> 08:55.410
We're aware you plan on

08:53.158 --> 08:55.410
arresting my client

08:55.452 --> 08:57.162
Robert Axelrod shortly.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.083
It is the policy of this office

09:02.125 --> 09:05.337
not to comment on ongoing

09:02.125 --> 09:05.337
investigations, if there is one.

09:05.379 --> 09:09.383
Mr. Attorney General,

09:05.379 --> 09:09.383
Chuck, come on.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.843
Let's spare everyone

09:09.424 --> 09:11.843
the raree-show

09:11.885 --> 09:14.054
and set a surrender date.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.223
I'm thinking 24 hours from now,

09:16.264 --> 09:18.392
with the place

09:16.264 --> 09:18.392
to be mutually agreed upon.

09:21.853 --> 09:25.690
If I agree, if you say

09:21.853 --> 09:25.690
Axelrod will surrender,

09:25.732 --> 09:27.734
it's your word,

09:25.732 --> 09:27.734
your law license,

09:27.775 --> 09:30.904
and your ass on the line,

09:27.775 --> 09:30.904
Mr. Bach.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.780
Assurances have been made,

09:32.822 --> 09:36.701
so I can make them to you.

09:32.822 --> 09:36.701
But hey,

09:36.743 --> 09:39.371
see for yourself.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.873
<i>...what amounts to</i>

09:39.413 --> 09:41.873
<i>a campaign against me,</i>

09:41.915 --> 09:46.127
<i>resulting in what I understand</i>

09:41.915 --> 09:46.127
<i>is to be yet another arrest.</i>

09:46.169 --> 09:47.962
<i>So I say to</i>

09:46.169 --> 09:47.962
<i>the Attorney General,</i>

09:48.004 --> 09:49.464
<i>come on, Chuck.</i>

09:49.506 --> 09:51.299
<i>Come on down here</i>

09:49.506 --> 09:51.299
<i>and arrest me now.</i>

09:51.341 --> 09:52.426
<i>I can prove my innocence.</i>

09:52.467 --> 09:55.429
Fuck me.

09:52.467 --> 09:55.429
He's downstairs.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.305
Right across the street.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.808
<i>...and so you know, as I do,</i>

10:00.850 --> 10:05.146
<i>that whatever kind of</i>

10:00.850 --> 10:05.146
<i>supposed crime I committed</i>

10:05.188 --> 10:08.400
<i>is really just the crime</i>

10:05.188 --> 10:08.400
<i>of living and breathing</i>

10:08.442 --> 10:10.068
<i>in Chuck Rhoades's</i>

10:08.442 --> 10:10.068
<i>general vicinity.</i>

10:10.110 --> 10:11.819
This is fucked.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.071
Yeah. But our man's

10:11.861 --> 10:13.071
fucking 'em right back,

10:13.113 --> 10:15.490
and in their backyard, no less.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.700
This seems like going up

10:15.532 --> 10:17.700
to a murder hornet's nest,

10:17.742 --> 10:20.620
shaking it and almost

10:17.742 --> 10:20.620
asking it to sting you.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.663
If Bobby Axelrod

10:20.661 --> 10:22.663
shook a hornet's nest,

10:22.705 --> 10:24.165
the goddamn hornet

10:22.705 --> 10:24.165
ought to have

10:24.207 --> 10:25.959
the goddamn sense

10:24.207 --> 10:25.959
to stay inside.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.920
I don't know, Dollar Bill.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.920
A hornet's kind of like me.

10:28.962 --> 10:32.006
Once we're in attack mode,

10:28.962 --> 10:32.006
we don't fucking retreat.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.216
You're freaking me out.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.051
But look,

10:33.258 --> 10:35.051
now is the time to stand

10:35.093 --> 10:37.095
to get this thing done

10:35.093 --> 10:37.095
once and for all.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.805
So come on, Chuck.

10:38.846 --> 10:42.892
Charge me with something and see

10:38.846 --> 10:42.892
if you can make it stick.

10:42.934 --> 10:44.561
Oh.

10:44.603 --> 10:47.021
So, then, you heard me.

10:44.603 --> 10:47.021
Where are the cuffs?

10:47.063 --> 10:48.731
Oh... you don't get

10:47.063 --> 10:48.731
to decide the when and where

10:48.773 --> 10:50.650
-on my timetable.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.650
-[chuckles]

10:50.691 --> 10:54.028
It appears that your timetable

10:50.691 --> 10:54.028
is as many years as you like.

10:54.070 --> 10:57.031
But it seems like just yesterday

10:54.070 --> 10:57.031
you were striding in my office

10:57.073 --> 10:58.825
to tell me that

10:57.073 --> 10:58.825
you had nothing to lose.

10:58.866 --> 11:00.577
Or was it the day

10:58.866 --> 11:00.577
before yesterday,

11:00.619 --> 11:03.079
and yesterday was when

11:00.619 --> 11:03.079
you were telling me

11:03.121 --> 11:06.500
that it was worth it

11:03.121 --> 11:06.500
for you to go down with me.

11:06.541 --> 11:09.461
This is personal.

11:06.541 --> 11:09.461
It's not judicial.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.630
And this is when I finally

11:09.503 --> 11:11.630
get my chance to prove it.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.465
Oh, yes.

11:13.507 --> 11:17.344
He will get the day in court

11:13.507 --> 11:17.344
he so richly deserves.

11:17.385 --> 11:20.514
Once I have everything in order,

11:17.385 --> 11:20.514
and I will, quite soon,

11:20.555 --> 11:21.680
it'll happen.

11:21.722 --> 11:24.434
Mr. Axelrod will

11:21.722 --> 11:24.434
surrender to me.

11:24.476 --> 11:26.353
That's a legal term,

11:24.476 --> 11:26.353
to be clear, Chuck.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.770
[chuckles]

11:27.812 --> 11:30.689
So I will. Technically.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.317
But know this...

11:32.359 --> 11:36.070
I will be fighting you

11:32.359 --> 11:36.070
to my dying breath.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.405
[reporter 1]

11:36.112 --> 11:37.405
Another word before you go?

11:37.447 --> 11:38.532
[reporter 2]

11:37.447 --> 11:38.532
Mr. Rhodes before you leave.

11:38.573 --> 11:41.742
[camera shutters clicking]

11:53.880 --> 11:55.756
So then, any more questions?

11:55.798 --> 11:58.552
I will answer whatever

11:55.798 --> 11:58.552
my mouthpiece will allow.

11:58.593 --> 11:59.594
[clamoring]

11:59.636 --> 12:02.180
[applause]

12:02.222 --> 12:03.722
Well, I want to cheer too,

12:03.764 --> 12:05.600
but these circumstances

12:03.764 --> 12:05.600
feel trepidatious.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.727
Yeah, I'm feeling discomfited

12:05.642 --> 12:08.727
about my future.

12:08.769 --> 12:10.188
Oh, look,

12:08.769 --> 12:10.188
the fucking vocab twins.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.772
You guys aren't getting it.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.651
You don't drag an

12:11.814 --> 12:14.651
alley fighter into an alley.

12:14.693 --> 12:16.653
'Cause that's what Axe is,

12:14.693 --> 12:16.653
an alley fighter,

12:16.695 --> 12:18.405
a real Carboni.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.615
And that's where Chuck Rhoades

12:18.446 --> 12:20.615
just dragged him.

12:20.657 --> 12:23.117
While they're alley fighting,

12:20.657 --> 12:23.117
where does that leave us?

12:23.159 --> 12:24.869
It leaves you head down,

12:23.159 --> 12:24.869
eyes forward,

12:24.911 --> 12:26.996
doing good work earning

12:24.911 --> 12:26.996
returns for the firm--

12:27.038 --> 12:28.707
or the bank,

12:27.038 --> 12:28.707
as the case may be.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.124
The rest will sort itself out.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.586
Much like

12:30.166 --> 12:32.586
the recent unpleasantness.

12:32.627 --> 12:35.296
We need to stay calm

12:32.627 --> 12:35.296
and unified.

12:35.338 --> 12:36.881
That'll be a first

12:35.338 --> 12:36.881
for this place.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.884
Yeah. And won't the assets

12:36.923 --> 12:39.884
be frozen and seized?

12:39.926 --> 12:42.220
He'll come up with a workaround.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.220
Like he has in the past.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.180
Like he always does.

12:44.222 --> 12:47.267
Yes, I'm-- I'm sure some kind of

12:44.222 --> 12:47.267
arrangement will be struck.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.269
Near-term,

12:47.308 --> 12:49.269
the negative press will suck.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.853
But in the long run,

12:50.895 --> 12:54.982
we will win, as we always have.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.775
So was his getting out

12:55.024 --> 12:56.775
ahead of it

12:56.817 --> 12:59.529
with a press conference

12:56.817 --> 12:59.529
part of the plan?

12:59.571 --> 13:00.947
These things are fluid.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.203
I can't spare

13:05.577 --> 13:07.203
the time or the focus

13:07.245 --> 13:09.122
to take the two of you

13:07.245 --> 13:09.122
apart today.

13:09.163 --> 13:12.166
But if I did, believe me, you'd

13:09.163 --> 13:12.166
be lying on the floor in pieces.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.710
Taylor, I can understand

13:12.208 --> 13:13.710
why you think

13:13.752 --> 13:15.462
anything you do

13:13.752 --> 13:15.462
to him is justified.

13:15.503 --> 13:18.506
You've basically become him,

13:15.503 --> 13:18.506
on his worst day.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.341
But Rian,

13:20.383 --> 13:23.052
you still have the spark

13:20.383 --> 13:23.052
of a soul about you.

13:23.094 --> 13:25.513
The way you used me for--

13:25.555 --> 13:28.224
Not even your own ends,

13:25.555 --> 13:28.224
but Taylor's?

13:28.266 --> 13:31.394
If you don't about-face now,

13:28.266 --> 13:31.394
this minute,

13:31.436 --> 13:33.438
you won't even recognize

13:31.436 --> 13:33.438
who you were

13:33.480 --> 13:34.855
by the time you turn 26.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.369
I thought you had

13:46.326 --> 13:48.369
your arms around this.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.037
I did. I do.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.039
Believe me,

13:50.079 --> 13:52.039
I'm taking fucking measures.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.459
I hope so. Because a wounded

13:52.081 --> 13:54.459
and cornered Bobby Axelrod

13:54.501 --> 13:56.085
is not something many survive.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.048
I'm not for firing squads.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.383
-Good to know.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.383
-Yeah.

14:02.425 --> 14:03.842
I saw the Kubrick film

14:02.425 --> 14:03.842
as a tyke,

14:03.884 --> 14:05.844
turned me off 'em.

14:03.884 --> 14:05.844
But if I were,

14:05.886 --> 14:09.641
it would be for those who

14:05.886 --> 14:09.641
leak secrets to enemy forces,

14:09.683 --> 14:11.184
leave us unprotected against--

14:11.225 --> 14:12.560
Yes. True.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.479
I could tell you stories.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.063
Yeah, I'm sure you could, Karl.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.525
But right now,

14:16.105 --> 14:18.525
the story we need to tell

14:18.566 --> 14:22.069
is that of the arrest and

14:18.566 --> 14:22.069
conviction of Robert Axelrod.

14:22.111 --> 14:25.699
Later, we will find

14:22.111 --> 14:25.699
and punish the leaker.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.450
Not against the wall, though.

14:27.492 --> 14:28.868
We'll stop just short of that.

14:28.909 --> 14:30.370
Yes.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.580
For now, I want

14:30.411 --> 14:32.580
surveillance on Axelrod

14:32.622 --> 14:33.956
to prevent any bullshit.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.625
I want Michael Wagner

14:33.998 --> 14:35.625
scooped up.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.712
We'll sweat him.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.712
Work on him to flip.

14:38.753 --> 14:41.548
Probably useless,

14:38.753 --> 14:41.548
but I want my time in the ring.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.090
You'll have it.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.051
We need to put Axe in a spot

14:43.132 --> 14:45.051
where he takes a plea.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.594
No trial.

14:46.636 --> 14:49.597
No popularity contest

14:46.636 --> 14:49.597
or chance to manipulate.

14:49.639 --> 14:50.890
Hmm. We move

14:49.639 --> 14:50.890
to sequester the jury,

14:50.931 --> 14:52.392
so that he can't

14:50.931 --> 14:52.392
try to buy them.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.310
But, Chuck, we do have

14:52.433 --> 14:54.310
a strong enough case to--

14:54.352 --> 14:55.770
As we have in the past.

14:55.812 --> 14:56.979
No.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.606
We make him admit his guilt.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.024
Take his punishment.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.318
We win with a plea

15:00.066 --> 15:02.318
even before a trial

15:02.360 --> 15:04.404
because that win,

15:02.360 --> 15:04.404
that justice,

15:04.445 --> 15:06.155
is the important thing.

15:06.197 --> 15:08.157
As Patrick Ewing knows well,

15:08.199 --> 15:09.992
don't settle

15:08.199 --> 15:09.992
for a finger roll,

15:10.034 --> 15:12.119
dunk the fucking ball.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.914
I don't even understand

15:12.161 --> 15:14.914
what Wendy was saying,

15:14.955 --> 15:16.666
but it made me feel icky.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.501
No, she is right.

15:18.543 --> 15:21.045
You won't recognize yourself

15:18.543 --> 15:21.045
by the end of our time together.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.130
Because that person

15:21.087 --> 15:23.130
you were lied to herself

15:23.172 --> 15:25.007
about who she was

15:23.172 --> 15:25.007
and what she wanted.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.510
That was a person who

15:25.049 --> 15:27.510
became artsy and quirky

15:27.552 --> 15:30.388
and analytical when

15:27.552 --> 15:30.388
she was picked on as a kid

15:30.430 --> 15:32.932
instead of using what

15:30.430 --> 15:32.932
she really felt,

15:32.973 --> 15:34.475
which was hatred.

15:34.517 --> 15:37.437
I did not. I don't hate.

15:37.478 --> 15:40.565
You do. You've turned it

15:37.478 --> 15:40.565
into something else.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.650
Like I used to.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.819
But it was impressed

15:42.692 --> 15:44.819
upon me that instead,

15:44.861 --> 15:46.362
and listen to me here,

15:46.404 --> 15:50.157
instead, it's best

15:46.404 --> 15:50.157
turned into fuel

15:50.199 --> 15:52.827
because it's effective.

15:52.869 --> 15:55.121
And nothing burns as clean.

15:59.834 --> 16:02.796
[Axe] <i> This is not</i>

15:59.834 --> 16:02.796
<i>a usual investment meeting.</i>

16:02.837 --> 16:04.714
For this next little stretch,

16:04.756 --> 16:06.841
I'll be relaying my

16:04.756 --> 16:06.841
instructions to you remotely.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.426
As will I.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.553
We won't be in the office

16:08.468 --> 16:10.553
as much as usual.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.012
So it's goodbye for now

16:12.054 --> 16:14.098
while we take cover to fight.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.434
But we will be back at it

16:14.140 --> 16:16.434
again soon enough.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.894
We'll hold it

16:16.476 --> 16:17.894
down for you, boss.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.854
I know you will, Bill.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.648
That's why there'll always be

16:19.896 --> 16:21.648
a place for an operator like you

16:21.689 --> 16:22.899
in the money business.

16:22.941 --> 16:24.901
And your place is here,

16:22.941 --> 16:24.901
Axe Cap.

16:24.943 --> 16:27.487
Now, keep your eyes open

16:24.943 --> 16:27.487
for opportunity, even now.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.489
You got it.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.324
It feels like we're at the end.

16:31.365 --> 16:34.702
Nah, the end of the beginning

16:31.365 --> 16:34.702
is all, Ben Kim.

16:36.788 --> 16:37.956
Come on.

16:44.671 --> 16:45.588
All right?

16:48.633 --> 16:51.469
Sean, how much is in

16:48.633 --> 16:51.469
the Foundation right now?

16:51.511 --> 16:53.888
The princely sum

16:51.511 --> 16:53.888
of 570 million.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.932
We're gonna need a war chest

16:53.930 --> 16:55.932
for this battle.

16:55.974 --> 16:59.811
I need to have it transferred to

16:55.974 --> 16:59.811
a new entity for the time being.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.646
I'll send you the information.

17:01.688 --> 17:05.107
I have always had a plan at

17:01.688 --> 17:05.107
the ready for this contingency.

17:05.149 --> 17:06.734
Able man you are.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.862
We'll be back at those

17:06.776 --> 17:08.862
good works soon enough.

17:08.903 --> 17:12.615
As always,

17:08.903 --> 17:12.615
I serve at your pleasure.

17:14.868 --> 17:17.537
[exhales]

17:17.578 --> 17:20.206
[footsteps approaching]

17:21.958 --> 17:24.627
Catch up with you later.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.340
[exhales]

17:29.382 --> 17:31.634
I didn't think I needed to hear

17:29.382 --> 17:31.634
what the rest of them did.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.302
And I didn't think you'd show.

17:33.344 --> 17:36.180
-I'm not scared.

17:33.344 --> 17:36.180
-I know what you did.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.683
That Boyd move

17:36.222 --> 17:38.683
with the cannabis company

17:38.725 --> 17:41.352
wasn't self-interest

17:38.725 --> 17:41.352
or a greed play.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.770
You fucking baited me.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.397
[scoff] You once said to me

17:44.438 --> 17:47.274
you didn't think you

17:44.438 --> 17:47.274
learned enough from me yet.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.109
Seems like now you have.

17:49.151 --> 17:52.363
I thought we'd come

17:49.151 --> 17:52.363
together here.

17:52.405 --> 17:55.616
You forced me back into working

17:52.405 --> 17:55.616
for you practically at gunpoint.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.159
So along the way, you thought

17:55.658 --> 17:57.159
you'd team up with Chuck

17:57.201 --> 17:58.786
to fuck me?

17:58.828 --> 18:01.080
I decided it right

17:58.828 --> 18:01.080
from the start, as you know.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.582
I just forgot

18:01.121 --> 18:02.582
for a little while.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.000
Uh-huh.

18:04.042 --> 18:06.126
Even though it was me

18:04.042 --> 18:06.126
that took you in?

18:06.168 --> 18:08.796
Just another fucking math nerd?

18:08.838 --> 18:10.673
One with potential to be sure,

18:10.715 --> 18:12.174
but one of many.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.927
If you had more than one of me,

18:13.968 --> 18:16.220
you'd have gotten rid

18:13.968 --> 18:16.220
of the actual me long ago.

18:16.262 --> 18:19.057
But you didn't because

18:16.262 --> 18:19.057
I am a special fucking case,

18:19.098 --> 18:20.975
as you might put it.

18:21.017 --> 18:23.143
Not so special you didn't need

18:21.017 --> 18:23.143
me to platform you.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.521
I propped you up,

18:23.185 --> 18:25.521
brought you along,

18:25.563 --> 18:27.732
gave you the keys to

18:25.563 --> 18:27.732
a fucking space shuttle.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.276
I thought you wanted

18:27.774 --> 18:30.276
to get rich together,

18:30.317 --> 18:32.236
and I let that fool me.

18:32.278 --> 18:35.197
But your problem,

18:32.278 --> 18:35.197
as an investor,

18:35.239 --> 18:37.951
is that your idealism is at war

18:35.239 --> 18:37.951
with your profit drive.

18:37.992 --> 18:39.911
And one day that will

18:37.992 --> 18:39.911
ruin you.

18:39.953 --> 18:43.539
While your problem, as a boss,

18:39.953 --> 18:43.539
as a mentor, as a person,

18:43.581 --> 18:45.875
is you see my work product,

18:43.581 --> 18:45.875
my company, me,

18:45.917 --> 18:48.002
as yours to do with

18:45.917 --> 18:48.002
as you see fit.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.713
And so now you've

18:48.044 --> 18:50.713
killed your mentor.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.006
Congratulations.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.717
Must mean... what?

18:54.759 --> 18:57.303
Now you're strong?

18:57.344 --> 18:58.679
You can lead?

18:58.721 --> 19:00.264
Maybe.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.182
I did think I'd feel

19:00.306 --> 19:02.182
better about it, though,

19:02.224 --> 19:04.477
have some sense of victory

19:02.224 --> 19:04.477
or accomplishment.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.187
You never did react well

19:04.518 --> 19:07.187
to competition.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.940
No.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.608
But I have come to realize

19:08.982 --> 19:10.608
I'll do anything

19:10.650 --> 19:12.276
for my own autonomy.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.821
So you figured you'd let

19:12.318 --> 19:14.821
the government freeze

19:14.862 --> 19:16.280
everything that's mine,

19:16.322 --> 19:17.824
and then go to your pal

19:16.322 --> 19:17.824
Chuck Rhoades

19:17.865 --> 19:20.743
and break off your piece

19:17.865 --> 19:20.743
and go off on your own?

19:20.785 --> 19:23.537
Something along those lines.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.541
But now,

19:24.998 --> 19:27.541
all I really feel is...

19:28.626 --> 19:30.294
sadness.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.756
That I want to thank you,

19:30.336 --> 19:33.756
as ridiculous as that is.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.633
And I think I'm...

19:37.093 --> 19:39.137
no, I am sorry.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.347
Sorry that it came to this.

19:41.388 --> 19:42.431
You're sorry?

19:42.473 --> 19:45.434
Shit. You'll get over it.

19:45.476 --> 19:47.436
The amount of time you spend

19:47.478 --> 19:50.106
feeling bad over slitting

19:47.478 --> 19:50.106
your enemies' throats

19:50.148 --> 19:52.399
will get shorter and shorter

19:50.148 --> 19:52.399
in the future

19:52.441 --> 19:54.610
until it's barely

19:52.441 --> 19:54.610
a fucking blip.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.531
And if you don't get over it,

19:58.572 --> 20:00.199
well, you can bring me

19:58.572 --> 20:00.199
some cookies

20:00.240 --> 20:04.286
to Wallkill Correctional

20:00.240 --> 20:04.286
on visiting day.

20:04.328 --> 20:07.707
But I don't think it's

20:04.328 --> 20:07.707
gonna go that way.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.626
And I think you know that.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.518
[Chuck] Well, Mr. Wagner,

20:27.560 --> 20:30.521
we find ourselves

20:27.560 --> 20:30.521
across the table once again.

20:30.563 --> 20:34.233
Only this time, you don't have

20:30.563 --> 20:34.233
your master to hide behind.

20:34.274 --> 20:35.943
I have Neal, here, though.

20:35.985 --> 20:38.112
[scoffs] 'Fraid that's

20:35.985 --> 20:38.112
not going to be much help.

20:38.154 --> 20:41.323
Oh, you're facing up

20:38.154 --> 20:41.323
to 25 years, friend-o.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.325
Two bits.<i> Vente-cinco.</i>

20:43.367 --> 20:45.912
That's what a bank CEO like you

20:43.367 --> 20:45.912
who's driven clear over

20:45.953 --> 20:48.622
the lane markers

20:45.953 --> 20:48.622
of Know Your Customer,

20:48.664 --> 20:51.542
smack into the guardrails

20:48.664 --> 20:51.542
of Anti-Money Laundering laws,

20:51.584 --> 20:53.335
is staring down.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.588
Long time. You'll be

20:53.377 --> 20:55.588
a senior citizen looking for

20:55.629 --> 20:57.631
your Social Security check

20:55.629 --> 20:57.631
by the time you get out.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.633
If Social Security

20:57.673 --> 20:59.633
even exists by then.

20:59.675 --> 21:03.054
But there is a golden ladder

20:59.675 --> 21:03.054
reaching down to you,

21:03.096 --> 21:05.181
and I am the one extending it.

21:05.223 --> 21:09.018
All you have to do is place

21:05.223 --> 21:09.018
the blame where it belongs

21:09.060 --> 21:11.478
and grab on.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.065
You're talking about me

21:11.520 --> 21:14.065
cooperating against Axe?

21:14.107 --> 21:16.025
I am.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.861
Spare us the time and effort

21:16.067 --> 21:18.861
of feigning loyalty.

21:18.903 --> 21:22.448
Just shed that dry,

21:18.903 --> 21:22.448
flaking skin

21:22.489 --> 21:26.119
like the reptile you are

21:22.489 --> 21:26.119
and slither away shiny and new.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.536
[Sacker] Tell us

21:26.160 --> 21:27.536
how he steered you.

21:27.578 --> 21:29.205
How he forced you.

21:29.247 --> 21:31.958
How he knew about the bad ton

21:29.247 --> 21:31.958
of unregulated marijuana

21:31.999 --> 21:34.668
and yet made the bank

21:31.999 --> 21:34.668
take the cash on board.

21:41.134 --> 21:42.426
Shit.

21:45.054 --> 21:46.513
You know what?

21:46.555 --> 21:48.933
Life's too fucking short.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.933
Let's do this.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.435
Mr. Wagner, please, let me

21:48.975 --> 21:51.435
represent your interests here.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.353
-It's my job--

21:51.477 --> 21:53.353
-Thank you,

21:53.395 --> 21:55.189
and, respectfully, you're

21:53.395 --> 21:55.189
the best lawyer in the world,

21:55.231 --> 21:57.191
but zip it, Neal.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.191
You'll get paid either way.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.944
Get the papers drawn up

21:57.233 --> 21:59.944
while I clear my throat.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.155
You should probably also

21:59.986 --> 22:02.155
relocate me while you're at it.

22:02.196 --> 22:04.657
I hear Idaho's a nice place

22:04.698 --> 22:07.367
for people with certain beliefs.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.203
Can you be my case officer?

arrest Bobby Axelrod,

30:57.356 --> 31:00.359
and I found

30:57.356 --> 31:00.359
myself contemplative.

31:00.400 --> 31:03.987
There was one person

31:00.400 --> 31:03.987
I wanted to see.

31:04.029 --> 31:06.782
And it was you.

31:06.824 --> 31:08.826
Good. Ill.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.495
Motherfucker. Sweetheart.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.497
In whatever role...

31:15.040 --> 31:16.667
you're my father.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.087
And all I do

31:21.129 --> 31:24.049
is in reaction to that

31:21.129 --> 31:24.049
in some way.

31:24.090 --> 31:26.635
What about the fact that

31:24.090 --> 31:26.635
I tried to fuck

31:26.677 --> 31:29.388
your entire life's work

31:26.677 --> 31:29.388
the other day?

31:29.429 --> 31:33.392
You're willing to just

31:29.429 --> 31:33.392
forget about that?

31:33.433 --> 31:38.146
And the fact that you knew

31:33.433 --> 31:38.146
I would, and used it.

31:38.188 --> 31:41.274
You have been

31:38.188 --> 31:41.274
through a terrible ordeal.

31:42.818 --> 31:46.780
I watched you almost

31:42.818 --> 31:46.780
accept your own death.

31:46.822 --> 31:51.159
Anybody would come out of

31:46.822 --> 31:51.159
that questioning everything.

31:51.201 --> 31:52.952
Even their loyalties.

31:52.994 --> 31:54.830
If I were you,

I wouldn't go in

31:58.458 --> 32:02.462
You've had Axelrod

31:58.458 --> 32:02.462
in cuffs before, Sonny.

32:02.504 --> 32:05.131
Doesn't mean

32:02.504 --> 32:05.131
you'll keep him there.

32:05.173 --> 32:08.218
I guess it's possible, Pops.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.429
But I like our odds.

32:10.470 --> 32:13.265
That was supposed to get a very

32:10.470 --> 32:13.265
different reaction out of you.

32:13.306 --> 32:15.934
You were supposed to snap at me.

32:26.486 --> 32:27.863
That's why you're here.

You've actually won,

32:33.201 --> 32:36.288
haven't you?

32:38.998 --> 32:44.003
That also means that I

32:38.998 --> 32:44.003
backed the wrong gladiator.

32:44.045 --> 32:47.800
I looked at the situation

32:44.045 --> 32:47.800
from all the angles,

32:47.841 --> 32:51.428
and put my money down on Axe.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.597

41:51.843 --> 41:53.636
wow.

41:53.678 --> 41:55.847
So this is what it is

41:53.678 --> 41:55.847
to lose.

41:55.888 --> 41:57.223
Okay.

42:04.189 --> 42:06.816
Fine.

42:04.189 --> 42:06.816
We do the deal.

42:06.858 --> 42:08.067
With one exception--

42:08.109 --> 42:09.777
Taylor Mason Carbon.

42:08.109 --> 42:09.777
Let them go.

42:09.819 --> 42:10.945
Break 'em off of Axe Cap.

42:12.697 --> 42:14.407
No can do.

42:14.449 --> 42:16.784
I worked with Wendy

42:14.449 --> 42:16.784
and Taylor briefly.

42:16.826 --> 42:18.828
I want them, need them.

42:18.870 --> 42:19.912
That's a deal breaker.

42:19.954 --> 42:22.415
So you get it all?

42:22.457 --> 42:24.417
My money. My companies.

42:22.457 --> 42:24.417
My people.

42:24.459 --> 42:25.584
Win, win, win.

42:27.462 --> 42:29.547
And me nowhere to be found.

42:29.588 --> 42:30.965
Yes.

42:32.633 --> 42:34.635
That I consider a win.

42:41.893 --> 42:43.311
Goddamnit.

42:46.731 --> 42:48.358
I'm sorry.

42:48.400 --> 42:51.236
You know he never would have

42:48.400 --> 42:51.236
if there was any other way.

42:51.277 --> 42:53.530
[Chuck] Mr. Wagner,

42:53.571 --> 42:57.534
this leaves<i> you</i> holding the bag,

42:53.571 --> 42:57.534
now doesn't it?

43:14.509 --> 43:17.845
[Gramm] As the CEO of the bank,

43:17.887 --> 43:19.055
you'll be fucking prosecuted.

43:19.097 --> 43:20.973
[chuckling] No.

43:21.015 --> 43:23.351
You see, I'm just a guy

43:21.015 --> 43:23.351
who was offered a CEO job.

43:23.393 --> 43:24.852
I never did take it, though.

43:24.894 --> 43:27.564
See right here? Never signed.

43:27.605 --> 43:30.816
We have carte fucking blanche

43:27.605 --> 43:30.816
on company records.

43:30.858 --> 43:31.817
We'll find the real one.

43:31.859 --> 43:34.279
Oh, shit. No, we won't.

43:34.320 --> 43:36.531
Yeah, Bobby Axelrod

43:34.320 --> 43:36.531
was the cosigner,

43:36.573 --> 43:38.074
so you can get him to testify.

43:38.116 --> 43:40.993
But I don't see that happening.

43:38.116 --> 43:40.993
So good luck.

43:41.035 --> 43:42.745
[Sacker] We can't waste

43:41.035 --> 43:42.745
our time with them.

43:42.787 --> 43:44.747
We need to get the FAA, recheck

43:42.787 --> 43:44.747
the no-fly list Axe was on.

43:44.789 --> 43:47.417
-Look at air traffic.

43:44.789 --> 43:47.417
-No point.

43:47.459 --> 43:50.962
Mrs. Sacker, Mrs. Gramm,

43:51.003 --> 43:52.922
when someone leaves

43:51.003 --> 43:52.922
a burning sack of excrement

43:52.964 --> 43:55.049
on your doorstep

43:52.964 --> 43:55.049
and rings your doorbell,

43:55.091 --> 43:58.010
it's best not to stomp it out,

43:55.091 --> 43:58.010
lest you get covered in shit.

44:01.264 --> 44:05.310
[Axe] I used to think it was

44:01.264 --> 44:05.310
a total waste of $60 million.

44:05.351 --> 44:06.936
The third plane?

44:06.978 --> 44:08.896
Of course it's a waste,

44:08.938 --> 44:10.898
just like everything

44:08.938 --> 44:10.898
in the top right corner

44:10.940 --> 44:13.901
of the risk

44:10.940 --> 44:13.901
and control matrix.

44:13.943 --> 44:15.487
Right up until you need it.

44:15.528 --> 44:17.989
So how does this work?

44:18.030 --> 44:23.035
I'm a little too tall

44:18.030 --> 44:23.035
to fit into a cello case.

44:23.077 --> 44:25.788
Outfitted as

44:23.077 --> 44:25.788
a private cargo jet.

44:25.830 --> 44:28.249
Special container

44:25.830 --> 44:28.249
that houses a regular seat.

44:28.291 --> 44:30.042
You'll be quite comfortable,

44:28.291 --> 44:30.042
I assure you.

44:30.084 --> 44:32.795
Medical instruments on

44:30.084 --> 44:32.795
the manifest, no passengers.

44:32.837 --> 44:36.633
You'll board the chopper

44:32.837 --> 44:36.633
to satisfy the tail,

44:36.674 --> 44:39.302
and then pass through

44:36.674 --> 44:39.302
out into a waiting vehicle.

44:39.344 --> 44:41.638
I'll have things taken

44:39.344 --> 44:41.638
care of on the other end

44:41.679 --> 44:44.557
long before you land.

44:44.599 --> 44:46.351
It's good to be the king.

44:48.186 --> 44:50.104
Hall,

44:50.146 --> 44:52.315
you are a true professional.

44:54.025 --> 44:56.819
In other circumstances,

44:56.861 --> 44:59.155
those words coming from you

44:59.197 --> 45:01.949
would actually, uh,

44:59.197 --> 45:01.949
make me smile.

45:04.536 --> 45:05.995
Fuck!

45:06.037 --> 45:07.746
Well...

45:07.788 --> 45:12.544
this turned into

45:07.788 --> 45:12.544
a tough day, Rhoades.

45:12.585 --> 45:13.710
I need a drink.

45:22.637 --> 45:23.971
Let's go.

45:24.013 --> 45:25.014
All right.

45:42.532 --> 45:44.825
[scoffs]

45:44.867 --> 45:47.370
Whoever was on the tail,

45:44.867 --> 45:47.370
they got beat.

45:47.412 --> 45:50.456
It's not their fault,

45:47.412 --> 45:50.456
but never use them again.

45:50.498 --> 45:51.999
This is....

45:54.711 --> 45:56.212
It's done! Fall back!

45:57.754 --> 45:59.924
But start thinking of

45:57.754 --> 45:59.924
the next move,

45:59.965 --> 46:02.677
and the move after because

45:59.965 --> 46:02.677
done does not mean finished.

46:02.719 --> 46:04.262
Not in this case.

46:05.638 --> 46:07.515
Mr. Bach, you made assurances.

46:07.557 --> 46:09.100
You will be hearing from us.

46:09.141 --> 46:12.144
Oh, I'll be looking

46:09.141 --> 46:12.144
forward to it.

46:23.573 --> 46:26.659
Didn't figure he'd leave

46:23.573 --> 46:26.659
you behind, huh?

46:26.701 --> 46:29.328
After all that effort,

46:26.701 --> 46:29.328
all that history,

46:29.370 --> 46:31.830
to just ghost you like that?

46:31.872 --> 46:33.999
Guess you bet on

46:31.872 --> 46:33.999
a bad pony, Wend.

46:34.041 --> 46:35.293
Chuck!

46:38.045 --> 46:39.880
Sorry for your loss.

46:52.310 --> 46:53.852
You knew.

46:56.105 --> 46:57.482
I knew? What did I know?

46:57.523 --> 46:59.150
That he wasn't gonna show.

46:59.191 --> 47:01.486
You're acting busted up,

46:59.191 --> 47:01.486
but you were in on it.

47:01.527 --> 47:03.028
You fucking knew it all.

47:06.365 --> 47:08.493
[Axe] You got here

47:06.365 --> 47:08.493
just in time for the sunrise.

47:08.534 --> 47:11.370
[Wendy] Yeah.

47:08.534 --> 47:11.370
It's nice here, like this.

47:11.412 --> 47:13.872
We can base out of here

47:11.412 --> 47:13.872
while we fight the case.

47:13.914 --> 47:17.335
Do, like, four nights a week,

47:13.914 --> 47:17.335
Thursday to Sunday?

47:17.376 --> 47:20.045
Yeah. Different options

47:17.376 --> 47:20.045
I'm exploring at this time

47:20.087 --> 47:22.214
for defending my liberty.

47:22.256 --> 47:23.966
How different?

47:24.008 --> 47:27.136
Oh, you know, there have been

47:24.008 --> 47:27.136
certain developments.

47:27.178 --> 47:29.514
Could turn out

47:27.178 --> 47:29.514
very nicely for us.

47:29.555 --> 47:31.265
Very strong move

47:29.555 --> 47:31.265
I'm thinking of.

47:33.726 --> 47:36.312
You're talking in

47:33.726 --> 47:36.312
generalities, like a...

47:36.354 --> 47:37.980
like a politician

47:36.354 --> 47:37.980
or something.

47:41.609 --> 47:43.402
Talk to me like Axe would.

47:44.945 --> 47:46.113
I realized this:

47:47.990 --> 47:51.160
I can't spend my life

47:47.990 --> 47:51.160
being some caged animal.

47:51.202 --> 47:52.578
Just can't.

47:52.620 --> 47:54.913
-Right. We're gonna--

47:52.620 --> 47:54.913
-No.

47:54.955 --> 47:59.585
I stay, the truth is,

47:54.955 --> 47:59.585
after the fight, I lose.

47:59.627 --> 48:01.212
They got me.

47:59.627 --> 48:01.212
I'm going to jail.

48:01.253 --> 48:03.047
I don't accept that.

48:03.088 --> 48:04.256
You don't have to.

48:04.298 --> 48:07.426
I'm not staying and fighting.

48:07.468 --> 48:08.720
I'm getting outta here.

48:10.680 --> 48:11.888
Where?

48:11.930 --> 48:13.932
To a place on the Continent.

48:13.974 --> 48:17.186
Where there's no extradition

48:13.974 --> 48:17.186
for certain financial crimes.

48:17.228 --> 48:20.147
Where I'll be able

48:17.228 --> 48:20.147
to monitor the arguments

48:20.189 --> 48:21.858
my lawyers

48:20.189 --> 48:21.858
are making from there.

48:24.276 --> 48:25.194
We will.

48:26.696 --> 48:28.030
Together.

48:29.824 --> 48:31.743
Come with me.

48:31.784 --> 48:33.118
[scoffs]

48:35.621 --> 48:37.164
So much of me...

48:39.250 --> 48:42.002
nearly all of me

48:39.250 --> 48:42.002
wants to say yes.

48:42.044 --> 48:43.796
Which part of you

48:42.044 --> 48:43.796
is saying no?

48:46.424 --> 48:50.177
[scoffs] Look, being

48:46.424 --> 48:50.177
on the run with you...

48:50.219 --> 48:53.514
that part, us together,

48:50.219 --> 48:53.514
like that...

48:53.556 --> 48:57.976
I can't think of

48:53.556 --> 48:57.976
anything more exciting,

48:58.018 --> 49:00.772
more enticing, but...

49:00.813 --> 49:03.900
I mean, come on, Bobby.

49:00.813 --> 49:03.900
Leaving my life. My kids.

49:03.982 --> 49:06.277
Think of what

49:03.982 --> 49:06.277
that would do to me,

49:06.318 --> 49:07.612
who it would turn me into.

49:12.241 --> 49:15.453
It would ruin whatever

49:12.241 --> 49:15.453
was between us, eventually.

49:15.494 --> 49:19.039
Because the kind of

49:15.494 --> 49:19.039
woman who'd do that...

49:19.081 --> 49:22.042
the truth is, you wouldn't want

49:19.081 --> 49:22.042
the version of me that would go.

49:22.084 --> 49:24.002
Believe me, I'd take it.

49:27.465 --> 49:29.634
If you stay, I'm in.

49:29.675 --> 49:33.011
Whatever that means.

49:29.675 --> 49:33.011
In all the ways.

49:33.053 --> 49:35.681
Including jailhouse visits,

49:33.053 --> 49:35.681
if it comes to that.

49:41.103 --> 49:43.898
I'm sorry,

49:41.103 --> 49:43.898
I can't let it come to that.

49:48.820 --> 49:50.488
And I can't come with you.

49:52.281 --> 49:53.825
I just can't.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.462
[exhales]

50:08.464 --> 50:10.842
If we can't finish it,

50:08.464 --> 50:10.842
we can't start it.

53:31.333 --> 53:33.169
You'll find I don't much

53:31.333 --> 53:33.169
speak about things that way,

53:33.209 --> 53:34.712
about who gets what,

53:34.753 --> 53:36.839
who shined by closing

53:34.753 --> 53:36.839
such and such deal,

53:36.881 --> 53:39.466
but I think it is

53:36.881 --> 53:39.466
important, crucial even,

53:39.508 --> 53:43.219
to begin by stating in the

53:39.508 --> 53:43.219
most plain terms what this is.

53:45.097 --> 53:46.431
And what this is...

53:48.184 --> 53:49.518
is mine.

53:52.980 --> 53:54.982
Oh, hey, this is Scooter.

53:55.024 --> 53:56.942
You may come to think

53:55.024 --> 53:56.942
of him as my Wags.

53:56.984 --> 53:59.570
Better dressed,

53:56.984 --> 53:59.570
better mannered.

53:59.611 --> 54:00.905
Perhaps not quite as much fun

54:00.946 --> 54:02.447
at an all-you-can-eat

or a mud wrestling

establishment,

54:04.616 --> 54:06.451
which are things

54:04.616 --> 54:06.451
of the past, anyway,

54:06.493 --> 54:09.747
but still pretty fun.

You may know I come

54:09.788 --> 54:11.623

and we can discuss your place

54:34.479 --> 54:37.024
in the new organization.

54:37.066 --> 54:40.861

I'll see you on

Not so fast, you two.

Well, that one I've seen.

Well, only one of them turned

55:47.052 --> 55:50.388
out to be loyal and useful.

55:50.430 --> 55:52.474
We'll see how that goes

55:50.430 --> 55:52.474
with you, Wagner.

that you won't

57:11.220 --> 57:13.013
even want to leave.

57:13.055 --> 57:16.141
even if we want to, right?

You could. You couldn't work
