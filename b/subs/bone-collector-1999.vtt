02:33.737 --> 02:34.737
How's it look?

02:34.947 --> 02:39.116
The cop's body's about 300 yards
down in an abandoned tunnel.

02:39.618 --> 02:41.661
-Howie?
-Right behind you, captain.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.747
Keep back till
I process the scene, okay?

04:01.366 --> 04:03.242
Watch out! It's falling!

05:14.064 --> 05:15.940
So where the hell is the car?

05:16.233 --> 05:17.400
I don't know.

05:18.235 --> 05:21.028
That's the last time
I take a goddamn redeye.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.238
We can take a cab.

05:23.073 --> 05:27.076
I'm gonna fire this son of a bitch.
He's always got some excuse.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.167
Well, come on.
We'll be home before you know it.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.627
Yeah.

06:16.626 --> 06:17.835
Excuse me?

06:18.086 --> 06:20.629
Excuse me,
I think you're going the wrong way.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.298
Excuse me.

06:23.467 --> 06:26.010
Honey. Honey. Honey, wake up.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.512
We're lost
or he's taking us for a ride.

06:29.473 --> 06:31.474
We're in the middle of nowhere.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.018
Where the hell you going?
I said Fifth Avenue.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.815
We're not tourists here, man!

06:40.317 --> 06:42.359
Hey, where are you going?

06:50.202 --> 06:52.328
Let us out. Stop the car!

06:53.830 --> 06:55.915
Stop this car!

07:07.344 --> 07:08.344
Shit!

07:09.054 --> 07:10.054
Oh, my God.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.847
Son of a bitch!

07:12.182 --> 07:14.266
Stop the goddamn car!

07:23.860 --> 07:25.361
-Please!
-Stop the car!

07:27.030 --> 07:28.656
Stop this car, goddamn it!

07:29.199 --> 07:30.199
Stop this car!

07:33.662 --> 07:35.037
Good morning.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.292
You're looking a little dehydrated.
How about some juice?

07:40.544 --> 07:42.586
How about two fingers of vodka?

07:42.921 --> 07:45.297
A little early for vodka,
don't you think?

07:45.549 --> 07:47.925
Time, as you know,
is a relative consideration.

07:48.718 --> 07:52.388
-Juice.
-Vodka.

07:52.556 --> 07:54.140
Juice.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.475
-Coming!
-Join me in a drink, Richard?

07:56.726 --> 08:00.229
I'd love to. But a med-tech
with liquor on his breath? l think not.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.065
-Thanks.
-So how are you?

08:03.400 --> 08:05.734
I'm better than
your heart-pacing gear.

08:05.986 --> 08:09.697
Every time, it's skewed further out
of spec. You really need a new unit.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.699
I really need a new body.

08:12.325 --> 08:16.579
I can't help you with that,
but I'll bring a new unit by tomorrow.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.455
This'll be stable till then.

08:18.707 --> 08:20.583
-Thank you.
-You take it easy.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.252
I'll take it any way I can get it.

08:24.212 --> 08:27.590
-How's he doing?
-He asked for vodka again.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.925
-Did you give him any?
-No.

08:30.594 --> 08:33.011
-Good morning, doctor.
-Hi, Richard.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.514
Hey, would you look at this?

08:36.600 --> 08:40.102
-A peregrine falcon, am l right?
-Yup.

08:40.812 --> 08:41.979
He likes cripples.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.774
There was a piece about them
in The Times the other day...

08:45.942 --> 08:47.943
...nesting all over the city.

08:48.278 --> 08:51.989
Something about the architecture
of these old New York buildings.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.325
I thought he liked my company.

08:58.872 --> 09:02.041
They're a little shy.
Don't take it personally.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.459
Can l get you a drink?

09:03.752 --> 09:05.127
No, thanks. l'm fine.

09:06.463 --> 09:07.630
Bed mode.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.266
-Got vodka in there?
-No.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.769
And you ain't getting any either.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.980
All right, l'll let you guys talk.

09:27.359 --> 09:31.403
So you can imagine how much sleep
I've gotten the past few days...

09:31.655 --> 09:33.489
...considering your request.

09:33.865 --> 09:36.992
Since I made my decision,
I've been sleeping like a baby.

09:37.202 --> 09:40.996
After all you have survived,
beat all the odds...

09:41.289 --> 09:44.708
...you know there's work
on nerve regeneration every day.

09:45.168 --> 09:49.797
One finger, two shoulders and a brain.
That's all l have, Barry.

09:50.799 --> 09:53.717
These dysreflexia seizures
are occurring more often.

09:54.386 --> 09:58.013
The buildup of fluid in my spine
is a degenerative condition.

09:58.181 --> 10:01.934
We know I'm waiting for the seizure
that'll make me a vegetable.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.855
I don't wanna be a vegetable, Barry.

10:09.192 --> 10:12.569
I want to make the final transition
on my own terms.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.700
I'll get it done with or without you.

10:18.910 --> 10:22.329
Yeah. Yeah, l suppose you would.

10:27.252 --> 10:28.377
So?

10:33.383 --> 10:35.592
-Okay.
-Okay what?

10:39.556 --> 10:41.974
Okay, l'll assist you...

10:42.976 --> 10:45.060
-...in your final transition.
-Today?

10:45.353 --> 10:48.897
There are preparations to be made.
This is not a flu shot.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.400
My business is in order.
My bags are packed.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.236
Besides, l've got
a medical conference to go to.

10:54.446 --> 10:55.988
I've got a plane to catch.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.740
You're lying.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.075
When do you get back?

11:01.745 --> 11:02.911
Sunday.

11:03.079 --> 11:06.373
Okay. Sunday.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.128
I'll see you then.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.589
Get out before you change your mind.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.469
Don't get up. l'll show myself out.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.929
Yeah, l'll race you to the door.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.598
Barry....

11:25.393 --> 11:26.602
You are...

11:28.271 --> 11:30.105
...a very good friend.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.491
Amelia?

12:23.368 --> 12:26.578
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.330
Morning.

12:28.665 --> 12:29.998
You okay?

12:30.208 --> 12:33.252
Yeah, l'm fine.
I just couldn't sleep.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.716
-What time is it?
-lt's early.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.019
I'll be late for work. I gotta shower.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.896
No, you don't. Stay here.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.023
I gotta go.

13:07.537 --> 13:08.745
Make breakfast?

13:09.038 --> 13:11.623
No, thanks. l'm gonna be late.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.751
Another slam-bam-thank-you-ma'am?

13:17.755 --> 13:19.131
All right, look....

13:20.758 --> 13:22.551
My therapist tells me...

13:22.719 --> 13:25.637
...l might not be getting what l need
out of this relationship.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.389
What are we doing here?

13:27.640 --> 13:30.434
I think you and me,
we make a great couple.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.313
You know where I stand on this.

13:34.564 --> 13:35.898
You know what l want.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.317
Steve, we've been through this.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.236
All right? l care about you.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.739
I can't make a commitment.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.250
Well, go to work then.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.128
You're gonna be late.

14:10.934 --> 14:14.770
-You're quitting the cops?
-l'm transferring to Youth Services.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.940
Lucky fuck. You must
have one hell of a rabbi.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.651
-We're gonna miss you.
-3-post-1 1 here.

14:20.944 --> 14:22.778
<i>Frightened child at Amtrak site.</i>

14:23.071 --> 14:24.321
I'll take it.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.949
Kid found something
over at the tracks.

14:27.158 --> 14:30.285
-Finish eating. I'll check it out.
-See you, kid.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.856
<i>3-post-1 1 ,</i>
<i>anything further on that 1 0-1 0?</i>

15:00.108 --> 15:01.525
Nothing yet.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.320
Wait. l think I see him.

15:06.698 --> 15:09.241
Are you the one
who called the police?

15:52.201 --> 15:53.702
Wait there, okay?

16:59.602 --> 17:00.936
Are you out of your mind?

17:01.104 --> 17:02.938
Just shut off the engine.

17:03.231 --> 17:06.273
There's been a homicide.
I can't let you through.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.038
I'm Amelia.
What's your name?

17:20.289 --> 17:22.582
-Chris.
-Chris. Hey.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.794
I got a job for you.
Here's money.

17:26.128 --> 17:29.631
I need you to buy me one of
those cheapo cardboard cameras.

17:29.799 --> 17:32.008
You know,
the ones you can throw away?

17:32.343 --> 17:33.844
Okay. Fast as you can.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.185
3-post-1 1 to Central.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.761
Captain Cheney, Detective Solomon.

19:40.096 --> 19:42.973
First officer on the scene
is over there.

19:43.474 --> 19:45.392
--on the tracks near the body.

19:45.810 --> 19:48.270
I collected it
before it was washed away.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.942
-l also took some pictures.
-Thanks.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.152
You stopped the train?

19:56.404 --> 19:58.947
It might have disturbed
the physical evidence.

19:59.156 --> 20:02.033
Why not shut down Grand Central
while you're at it?

20:02.285 --> 20:04.286
Patrolman Donahue. ls that right?

20:04.495 --> 20:05.620
Donaghy.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.957
-A rookie, l take it.
-No, sir.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.001
Pretty dumb.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.796
Captain, guess who the vic is?

20:15.006 --> 20:17.048
-Talk to me.
-Alan fucking Rubin.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.759
-Mister "Rebuild New York" himself?
-Yeah.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.219
Great.

20:21.929 --> 20:26.016
No one enters this area
except for my crime scene guys.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.820
Knight to H6. Check.

20:41.157 --> 20:43.491
You got company. Cops.

20:43.701 --> 20:46.703
-Tell them l'm busy.
-They said it was urgent.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.204
Tell them l'm out running.

20:49.165 --> 20:50.874
She's too polite for that, Linc.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.752
Hey, look who's here!

20:56.339 --> 20:58.340
I caught a serious situation.

20:58.549 --> 21:00.342
It's going around, Paulie.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.677
Chief Murphy sent me.

21:04.180 --> 21:05.180
The good chief.

21:07.183 --> 21:11.186
Heard about that couple at the airport?
Got in a taxi, never got home?

21:11.979 --> 21:13.063
He don't watch the news.

21:13.356 --> 21:16.858
You used to read four papers a day
and tape the news shows.

21:17.026 --> 21:19.861
Yeah, now l just hit
the rewind button. A3.

21:20.071 --> 21:21.404
Things never change.

21:21.697 --> 21:24.532
That was Alan Rubin
and his wife in that taxi.

21:25.368 --> 21:27.786
They found him dead,
buried, shot in the face...

21:28.037 --> 21:32.040
...hand sticking out of the ground
with his wife's ring on his finger...

21:32.208 --> 21:33.875
...which was skinned to the bone.

21:34.543 --> 21:35.877
She's still missing.

21:36.045 --> 21:37.796
Excuse me while you catch up.

21:38.047 --> 21:39.255
Don't go too far.

21:39.507 --> 21:43.009
We'll be letting these nice
gentlemen out in 30 seconds.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.554
Sounds like you got yourself
an open-and-shut there.

21:46.764 --> 21:48.264
I don't think so.

21:48.516 --> 21:50.892
A man worth several hundred
million found dead...

21:51.060 --> 21:53.812
...his wife's ring
on his mutilated hand.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.106
What's that tell you?

21:56.774 --> 21:59.150
The doer is saying he's got her.

21:59.610 --> 22:02.320
He's probably making
a ransom demand right now.

22:03.072 --> 22:05.782
-l'd have been paged.
-Check your batteries.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.243
It's definitely a ransom.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.789
Excuse me, Mr. Rhyme.
Kenneth Solomon.

22:13.249 --> 22:18.253
I've read all your books. Scene of
the Crime, at least a dozen times.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.255
It's great to meet you.

22:22.049 --> 22:25.635
-Where do you find these guys?
-They wanna work with the best.

22:26.303 --> 22:30.598
I guess now you're gonna ask me
to discuss the crime scene with you.

22:31.350 --> 22:35.145
We got a bunch of physical evidence
that doesn't exactly make sense.

22:35.438 --> 22:38.773
Some seriously weird stuff.
It's all in the report.

22:40.901 --> 22:43.194
-Thelma?
-You okay?

22:45.990 --> 22:47.574
-Linc, you okay?
-Out! Now!

22:47.783 --> 22:51.119
-Anything we can do?
-Asses out of here now!

22:51.287 --> 22:54.372
Let me get you some air.
Come on. Breathe for me.

22:56.333 --> 22:57.625
I said out!

22:58.335 --> 23:01.671
Come on. Deep breaths.
Deep breaths. Come on.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.215
Deep breaths.
I'm getting a BP on you.

23:04.467 --> 23:05.633
You gotta breathe.

23:05.843 --> 23:07.886
Look at me. Breathe.

23:11.807 --> 23:14.976
Look at me. Deep breaths.
Come on. Come on.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.479
You gotta take this oxygen.

23:17.646 --> 23:18.897
Stay with me.

23:19.607 --> 23:22.692
Come on. You can do it.
Don't go out on me now.

23:22.985 --> 23:24.736
Come on. Look at me.

23:49.678 --> 23:50.804
Thelma?

23:54.225 --> 23:56.518
-Thelma?
-You okay?

23:57.353 --> 24:01.064
I would be okay if your powers
of resuscitation were less adept.

24:02.066 --> 24:04.526
Look, not on my shift, all right?

24:04.735 --> 24:07.237
If you have a problem,
you can fire my ass.

24:07.446 --> 24:10.740
I provide for you in my will.
You ought to keep that in mind.

24:11.075 --> 24:15.787
Rhyme, I'm not interested in
having this conversation. Okay?

24:16.038 --> 24:17.413
-Okay.
-Okay.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.916
The crime scene report
Sellitto left....

24:20.209 --> 24:23.378
Could you take the photos
and load them in the viewer?

24:23.587 --> 24:25.046
View scan.

24:30.970 --> 24:34.222
Let's take a look at what we got here.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.183
Where it says location....

24:38.227 --> 24:41.729
Now what's that--?
What's it say about that newspaper?

24:42.106 --> 24:45.275
"Newspaper found beneath
a coarse-thread hex bolt...

24:45.568 --> 24:47.986
-...with 4 p.m. circled on it."
-Four p.m.

24:49.238 --> 24:52.949
Zoom.

24:55.077 --> 24:58.580
What about that piece of paper?
What's the number on there?

24:58.914 --> 25:01.249
"A torn book page with 1 1 9 on it."

25:01.750 --> 25:06.337
1 1 9, 4 p.m.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.427
1 1-9. What's today's date?

25:12.970 --> 25:14.762
Today's November 9.

25:15.431 --> 25:16.431
Phone mode.

25:16.807 --> 25:18.933
Sellitto, Paulie. Call.

25:23.731 --> 25:24.731
What?

25:27.651 --> 25:30.778
Sad fact is, a huge percentage
of inner-city kids...

25:30.946 --> 25:33.281
...have their
first drug experiences...

25:33.616 --> 25:35.950
...at the fifth grade level.

25:38.454 --> 25:41.456
Here are some of the drugs
they'll most likely be offered.

25:44.501 --> 25:45.960
Marijuana.

25:46.795 --> 25:49.464
How'd you like to get your hands
on that briefcase?

25:49.757 --> 25:51.174
Barbiturates.

25:51.842 --> 25:52.884
Amphetamines.

25:53.761 --> 25:55.136
Cocaine.

25:56.180 --> 25:57.847
Rock cocaine.

26:07.691 --> 26:10.777
-What's this about?
-You know who Lincoln Rhyme is?

26:10.986 --> 26:13.279
-What? The textbook guy?
-Yeah.

26:13.489 --> 26:16.991
-So what does that have to do with me?
-You'll find out.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.538
Come on in. They're right in there.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.294
A patrol cop took these pictures?

26:28.504 --> 26:31.381
Yeah, first one on the scene.
It started to rain.

26:31.548 --> 26:32.548
Smart cop.

26:32.800 --> 26:36.386
Had the balls to stop an Amtrak
from running over the crime scene.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.721
Here she is now.
Officer Donahoe...

26:39.348 --> 26:40.807
...meet Lincoln Rhyme.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.225
Donaghy.

26:46.563 --> 26:48.356
You took terrific photographs.

26:50.025 --> 26:51.609
You know who l am?

26:52.111 --> 26:54.362
I read your manual at the academy.

26:54.530 --> 26:55.530
What'd you think?

26:56.532 --> 26:57.865
I'm not a book critic.

26:58.826 --> 26:59.909
You found it useful?

27:00.703 --> 27:01.703
Yeah, l guess so.

27:01.912 --> 27:04.330
Sure you did.
You stopped that train.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.624
The photos you took.

27:07.876 --> 27:10.628
I'd say you have
a natural instinct for forensics.

27:11.213 --> 27:13.339
So what do we got, Paulie?

27:14.883 --> 27:18.219
We have footprints, size 1 0,
thanks to Officer Donaghy...

27:18.429 --> 27:20.888
...using a dollar bill
to establish scale.

27:21.056 --> 27:23.766
We have asbestos
where there shouldn't be any.

27:23.976 --> 27:27.437
An iron bolt holding down
a piece of paper...

27:27.646 --> 27:30.648
...a book page
with 1 1 9 written on it.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.775
Decaying oxidation on the bolt...

27:32.985 --> 27:35.903
<i>...but none on the thread.</i>
<i>Someone removed it...</i>

27:36.238 --> 27:37.572
...from somewhere else...

27:37.740 --> 27:41.075
<i>...and placed it there recently.</i>
<i>Wouldn't you agree, officer?</i>

27:41.368 --> 27:43.953
Wouldn't you agree,
Officer Donaghy?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.960
Paulie, l'm convinced
this crime scene was staged.

27:51.587 --> 27:53.880
-Perp's telling us something.
-What?

27:54.256 --> 27:56.924
Book, page 1 1 9. 1 1 -9.
That's today's date.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.510
Newspaper, 4 p.m.
What time you got?

27:59.678 --> 28:00.678
1 2:1 5.

28:02.264 --> 28:03.473
She's alive.

28:04.099 --> 28:07.018
-And he's gonna kill her at 4?
-P.M.

28:09.438 --> 28:11.105
We have your interest yet?

28:14.485 --> 28:17.111
I want you to work the case with us.

28:17.321 --> 28:18.946
It's not my area.

28:19.907 --> 28:22.116
Are you being modest, or are you...

28:22.284 --> 28:24.827
...uneasy about doing
some real police work?

28:26.413 --> 28:27.538
Excuse me?

28:27.790 --> 28:29.791
What department do you work in?

28:30.209 --> 28:32.960
Youth Services.
I picked her up at orientation.

28:33.170 --> 28:34.962
I see. Youth Services.

28:35.464 --> 28:38.174
I wait-listed a year,
and l won't jeopardise--

28:38.425 --> 28:40.051
Jeopardise what?

28:41.303 --> 28:42.637
Cushy desk job?

28:42.805 --> 28:45.681
-Forensics is not my area.
-l disagree with you.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.810
Well, you can't force me
to take this assignment.

28:51.188 --> 28:52.355
I can.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.482
And if l refuse?

28:54.650 --> 28:56.818
You're putting your career at risk.

28:57.069 --> 29:00.154
You think because of your condition
you can push people around?

29:00.489 --> 29:02.323
That is truly pathetic.

29:03.367 --> 29:04.367
Truly?

29:04.576 --> 29:06.577
Yeah, damn right. Truly.

29:06.829 --> 29:08.663
Well, forgive me truly...

29:09.331 --> 29:12.375
...if I insist on having
someone with your brains...

29:12.668 --> 29:16.546
...and a fresh pair of eyes.
There's a life at stake here, officer.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.007
We'll need key people
and tech support.

29:20.509 --> 29:22.009
-l know the guys.
-Okay.

29:23.971 --> 29:25.972
What the hell you smiling at?

29:35.899 --> 29:37.567
Pull up a chair.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.987
Tell me everything you know
about the crime scene.

29:41.697 --> 29:42.864
It's in my report.

29:43.282 --> 29:47.201
I read your report.
I want to know what you felt...

29:47.536 --> 29:49.078
...what you feel...

29:50.038 --> 29:52.373
...in the deepest recesses
of your senses.

29:52.791 --> 29:56.002
You are in love with the sound
of your voice, aren't you?

29:56.211 --> 29:59.505
It's your voice I want to hear.
Pull up a chair. l won't bite.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.912
The rifling on the .38 slug
they dug out of the victim...

30:31.163 --> 30:34.790
...is consistent with a Webley,
an old, turn-of-the-century handgun.

30:35.083 --> 30:37.960
On the big board, please.
What about that bolt?

30:38.587 --> 30:41.422
There's three initials
on the head: N.S.G.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.966
And the bolt's not steel. lt's iron.

30:44.259 --> 30:45.426
Iron.

30:45.928 --> 30:48.763
Iron. Iron. Making it old...

30:48.931 --> 30:50.431
...like the Webley.

30:50.641 --> 30:53.559
Officer Donaghy,
what do you know about asbestos?

30:53.810 --> 30:57.271
-lt kills Americans every day.
-Very good.

30:57.606 --> 30:59.440
-You computer literate?
-A little.

31:00.067 --> 31:01.067
Thelma!

31:01.777 --> 31:04.779
-Thelma? Where's my Thelma?
-Yes.

31:05.447 --> 31:07.698
Thelma, meet Amelia.
Amelia, Thelma.

31:07.950 --> 31:10.159
Amelia hates my books
and computers...

31:10.369 --> 31:12.870
...but she's got an A-plus nose
for evidence...

31:13.121 --> 31:16.165
...so show her how to
access D.E.P. files.

31:16.458 --> 31:20.878
See if there's any large asbestos
cleanups going on in the city.

31:21.129 --> 31:22.129
ASAP.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.842
-Where is Eddie Ortiz?
-Right here!

31:29.721 --> 31:31.973
How's the world's
crankiest criminalist?

31:32.391 --> 31:33.641
Playing "beat the clock."

31:33.850 --> 31:35.476
Everybody's worst nightmare.

31:35.644 --> 31:39.188
Get in a cab, and there's a psycho
from Jersey behind the wheel.

31:39.648 --> 31:41.190
We don't know he's from Jersey.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.485
Yeah, Bayonne. It's the toxins
in the water over there.

31:44.653 --> 31:45.820
You bring the whole lab?

31:46.029 --> 31:49.240
-Mom always told me to be prepared.
-Where do you want this?

31:49.491 --> 31:52.243
Put it over here in the corner.
How is your mother?

31:52.494 --> 31:56.539
She's 76, and she's shtupping a guy
named Morris. Can you believe that?

31:56.999 --> 31:58.165
God bless her.

31:58.333 --> 32:00.501
But it's Morris l'm worried about.

32:00.669 --> 32:03.671
He's 79 with a tricky ticker
and an active pecker.

32:04.298 --> 32:05.506
Hey.

32:11.513 --> 32:13.889
-Afternoon. Captain Cheney.
-Amelia...

32:14.141 --> 32:15.891
...what about that asbestos?

32:16.143 --> 32:18.644
There's a dozen cleanups
in the five boroughs.

32:18.854 --> 32:20.521
Put it up on the viewer for me.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.441
Narrow it down
to the oldest locations.

32:23.692 --> 32:25.067
How you doing, Howie?

32:25.360 --> 32:26.736
Fine. How's it going?

32:27.029 --> 32:29.447
In the middle of the middle,
as you can see.

32:30.198 --> 32:33.284
Look what l found on
the threading of that iron bolt.

32:34.911 --> 32:37.455
I was hoping to grab a minute
if you don't mind.

32:38.582 --> 32:39.665
Excuse me.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.375
Sorry. Sorry.

32:42.044 --> 32:45.880
We got Donaghy to thank for
photographing the crucial evidence.

32:46.089 --> 32:47.757
Crucial evidence?

32:47.966 --> 32:52.887
We don't know that. l wanted to make
sure you had the support you need.

32:53.305 --> 32:57.558
I'm putting the full resources of
my department here at your disposal.

32:57.893 --> 32:59.935
I appreciate it. Thank you.

33:00.187 --> 33:01.979
But the thing is, Linc...

33:02.564 --> 33:06.609
...l've formalized procedures
since you were in charge, and so--

33:06.902 --> 33:09.403
Put what you got up
on my screen, please.

33:10.238 --> 33:13.074
So l'd appreciate it
if you kept me in the loop.

33:13.241 --> 33:14.784
Absolutely.

33:15.243 --> 33:16.619
At all times.

33:17.204 --> 33:18.454
At all--

33:18.747 --> 33:21.207
What the hell is that
we're looking at?

33:23.335 --> 33:24.919
Old paper.

33:25.420 --> 33:26.921
Coarse grade.

33:27.422 --> 33:28.756
I'd say...

33:28.965 --> 33:30.758
...80, 90 years old.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.719
Turn-of-the-century, it looks like.

33:35.430 --> 33:37.431
The perp likes old.

33:37.599 --> 33:39.100
Fine, then....

33:39.309 --> 33:41.435
I'll be in my office if you need me.

33:41.978 --> 33:43.145
Yeah, okay, Howie.

33:43.939 --> 33:44.939
Good.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.277
Old paper.

33:51.154 --> 33:52.613
Old gun.

33:54.616 --> 33:58.452
Buries his victim in a vintage
Civil War railroad bed.

33:59.621 --> 34:00.788
Sand.

34:02.332 --> 34:05.543
Sand. Sand....
Eddie, what do you got on the sand?

34:06.503 --> 34:09.797
Doesn't really look like sand.

34:10.841 --> 34:13.300
-l'm not sure.
-Can you individuate it?

34:13.635 --> 34:15.136
If l had an EDX, I could.

34:15.637 --> 34:17.972
We don't have
a goddamn E-the-fuck-X.

34:18.556 --> 34:22.016
Look who forgot their chill pill
this morning. Excuse me.

34:22.268 --> 34:27.063
Come on. l'm all over this thing now.
Okay, we're talking...

34:27.858 --> 34:29.275
...pearly-looking.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.860
Some kind of a...

34:32.154 --> 34:34.572
...shellfish or something.

34:36.824 --> 34:38.409
Oyster shells, maybe?

34:40.078 --> 34:41.620
Could be.

34:43.415 --> 34:46.876
Definitely. lf l had to bet on it,
I'd say it was. Sure.

34:50.005 --> 34:53.174
I got it. The oldest asbestos
sites are coming up now.

35:23.455 --> 35:27.708
In 1 91 3, when the Woolworth Building
was being built...

35:27.876 --> 35:31.337
...workmen found the body of
a rich industrialist, Talbot Soames.

35:32.380 --> 35:36.050
He'd been kidnapped, shot and buried
in what they thought was sand.

35:36.259 --> 35:39.887
Turned out to be oyster shells.
Crushed oyster shells.

35:40.096 --> 35:43.057
That's what they used as
landfill in lower Manhattan.

35:43.225 --> 35:44.934
That's how Pearl Street got its name.

35:45.101 --> 35:48.562
That's where Mrs. Rubin's
gonna be, somewhere downtown.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.065
She'll be underground.

35:51.274 --> 35:53.609
She'll be in a basement...

35:53.902 --> 35:56.278
...near or in the Woolworth Building.

35:56.488 --> 36:00.783
Have Emergency Services Unit
meet us by the Woolworth Building.

36:00.992 --> 36:03.577
Tell them to start their search.
We may get lucky.

36:04.371 --> 36:05.913
Eddie, did you bring your van?

36:06.164 --> 36:07.957
-lt's downstairs.
-We'll need it.

36:08.291 --> 36:11.168
Throw your keys to Amelia.
You guys go with her.

36:11.419 --> 36:12.461
Should I go too?

36:12.671 --> 36:14.964
You stay here with me
and work that bolt.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.423
That's the missing piece.

36:16.633 --> 36:18.259
Should we keep Cheney in the loop?

36:18.760 --> 36:20.803
-Fuck him.
-Fuck him.

36:24.599 --> 36:25.599
Amelia.

36:26.601 --> 36:28.269
Just trust me.

36:29.104 --> 36:32.815
Just follow those instincts
you were born with. l'll be with you...

36:33.275 --> 36:35.276
...every step of the way.

36:45.620 --> 36:47.788
Jesus, 25 minutes left.

36:49.332 --> 36:53.294
-How did Rhyme get that way?
-He was born brilliant. It happens.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.963
I mean, the physical part.

36:57.299 --> 37:00.134
Four years ago, he was working
the body of a cop...

37:00.343 --> 37:02.636
...they'd found shot
in a subway tunnel.

37:03.471 --> 37:06.181
Beam came down
and damn near cut him in half.

37:06.683 --> 37:07.850
Jesus.

37:10.145 --> 37:11.145
Family?

37:12.480 --> 37:13.647
Sister in Phoenix.

37:14.357 --> 37:16.984
He never sees her.
Cut himself off.

37:17.861 --> 37:20.821
Technically, he's still on
active duty collecting pay.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.949
Insurance picks up
24-hour care and the gadgets.

37:24.159 --> 37:27.494
On weekends, always one or two cops
there lending a hand.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.456
-Tough deal.
-You won't hear him complaining.

37:30.665 --> 37:33.042
He likes pushing
other people's buttons.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.586
In your case, that's a compliment.

37:35.837 --> 37:40.007
You gotta learn to relax around
a compliment, especially from Rhyme.

37:40.175 --> 37:42.593
-You can be a little grating.
-Me?

37:42.844 --> 37:46.096
Kiddo, if you were any more
wound up, you'd be a Timex.

37:51.353 --> 37:55.397
He was a human dynamo, writing
books, lecturing all over the world...

37:55.690 --> 37:59.568
...giving expert opinion in trials,
working crimes in the city.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.278
You know what he'd do for fun?

38:01.613 --> 38:03.280
No, I can't imagine.

38:03.531 --> 38:06.492
He'd collect things.
Dirt, metals, plastics...

38:06.701 --> 38:09.787
...hubcaps, plants, musical strings...

38:10.038 --> 38:11.914
...medical tools, anything.

38:12.207 --> 38:13.374
Obsessive.

38:13.583 --> 38:17.544
He'd analyse and catalogue it
for his, what you call it, database.

38:18.964 --> 38:23.050
Jesus Christ! l'd like to get there
in one piece if possible.

38:48.410 --> 38:51.912
-New York Security Gate Company.
-That's good. What else?

38:52.163 --> 38:54.248
Nicholas Steven Gerard, elevators.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.166
-No, underground.
-A subway builder.

38:57.043 --> 38:59.920
-Subway builder sounds--
-Excuse me! N.S.G.

39:00.088 --> 39:04.758
"Niagara Steam Generation. Bought
by Eastern Gas and Electric in 1 928.

39:05.093 --> 39:09.096
The six-inch iron bolt was used
mainly for steam pipe assemblies."

39:55.810 --> 39:57.978
<i>You got 1 1 minutes.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

39:58.646 --> 40:00.856
<i>We just hit the financial district.</i>

40:01.149 --> 40:03.192
There's a steam junction...

40:03.401 --> 40:05.611
...with big asbestos-coated pipes.

40:05.987 --> 40:08.322
That's where she'll be.
I'd bet my legs on it.

40:08.531 --> 40:10.491
She'll be at Wall and Nassau.

40:10.825 --> 40:13.911
<i>-Wall and Nassau.</i>
-Has ESU been notified?

40:14.162 --> 40:16.497
<i>On their way.</i>
<i>They'll get there first.</i>

40:16.831 --> 40:20.834
Steam is released through
that junction every day at 4 p.m.

40:21.503 --> 40:23.670
Shit, what's this asshole up to?

40:23.922 --> 40:26.840
<i>l don't know, but it'll happen</i>
<i>in about 1 0 minutes.</i>

40:28.259 --> 40:30.344
We're here.
We're going down there.

40:34.849 --> 40:35.849
<i>Amelia?</i>

40:37.227 --> 40:38.227
Yeah, l'm here.

40:38.686 --> 40:42.022
It's their job to save Mrs. Rubin.
It's yours to get ready...

40:42.232 --> 40:44.733
<i>...and work the crime scene</i>
<i>if necessary.</i>

40:46.861 --> 40:50.030
<i>There's some things you'll need.</i>
<i>Look in the truck.</i>

40:50.448 --> 40:53.283
You'll see an aluminium suitcase...

40:54.035 --> 40:55.661
...and a radio headset.

40:56.704 --> 40:57.704
See it?

40:57.956 --> 40:59.540
<i>Yeah, l see them.</i>

41:21.437 --> 41:23.313
There must be a way in.

41:25.066 --> 41:28.735
-What's the problem here?
-Fucking valves freeze up easy.

41:29.237 --> 41:30.571
Come on. Shut it off!

41:30.822 --> 41:31.905
You there?

41:32.490 --> 41:33.574
<i>l'm here.</i>

41:34.576 --> 41:36.243
I'm inside the pipe.

41:42.208 --> 41:43.250
Go!

41:45.920 --> 41:47.337
I think I hear something.

41:47.589 --> 41:48.964
I hear something!

41:49.632 --> 41:52.593
<i>What's that? Someone's there.</i>
<i>l hear her crying!</i>

41:53.595 --> 41:55.429
Everyone, quiet now!

42:06.107 --> 42:11.945
Mrs. Rubin?

42:15.950 --> 42:16.950
She's there.

42:17.368 --> 42:18.785
<i>Mrs. Rubin!</i>

42:18.995 --> 42:20.954
We're on our way in now!

42:21.122 --> 42:22.623
Come on, guys. Come on.

42:22.832 --> 42:25.375
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's hurry the fuck up!

42:27.462 --> 42:29.004
Get a drill and a tap.

42:29.255 --> 42:31.131
Somebody cut this halfway through.

42:31.341 --> 42:33.383
<i>There's no way to turn it off.</i>

42:57.325 --> 42:58.367
Back!

43:32.360 --> 43:36.697
Paulie?

43:40.994 --> 43:44.037
Linc, she's gone.

43:44.205 --> 43:46.873
<i>The whole place is scalded in steam.</i>

43:47.208 --> 43:48.834
Let's go! Move away!

43:50.378 --> 43:54.089
ESU are gonna blow a hole
in the subbasement wall.

43:54.549 --> 43:58.260
I understand l'm working
with Chief Murphy's authorization.

43:58.720 --> 43:59.720
That's right.

43:59.929 --> 44:04.224
<i>l don't want Emergency Services guys</i>
<i>in there trampling the evidence...</i>

44:04.392 --> 44:05.934
...before we run the scene.

44:06.144 --> 44:07.144
<i>What do you want?</i>

44:07.562 --> 44:10.063
When they blow the hole,
I want Donaghy in first.

44:10.440 --> 44:14.735
She's not trained for this.
We could get our asses in a sling.

44:14.944 --> 44:17.571
<i>My ass has been</i>
<i>in a sling for four years.</i>

44:17.905 --> 44:20.907
Tell Hanson and his beasts
that's what l want. Period.

44:21.409 --> 44:23.285
All right. You got it.

44:31.085 --> 44:32.502
Okay, let's move!

44:42.889 --> 44:46.892
I'm doing this under protest.
The perp could still be in there!

44:47.101 --> 44:49.770
Rhyme's in charge,
and they're his orders.

44:50.438 --> 44:53.398
You can't handle it in there,
get your ass out.

44:53.608 --> 44:56.109
<i>-Amelia, you ready?</i>
-Yeah.

44:56.319 --> 44:57.944
You listen to me.

44:59.113 --> 45:01.656
I'm with you every step of the way.

45:02.825 --> 45:03.950
Go on.

45:05.036 --> 45:06.286
Good luck.

45:17.465 --> 45:20.217
<i>-l'm in.</i>
-Tell me what you see.

45:27.475 --> 45:29.810
<i>Everything's been boiled to hell.</i>

45:34.982 --> 45:36.316
Oh, God.

45:36.692 --> 45:37.984
<i>What is it?</i>

45:39.070 --> 45:41.071
It's an awful smell.

45:42.323 --> 45:43.490
Means you're close.

46:07.223 --> 46:09.057
I can't believe l'm doing this.

46:09.350 --> 46:10.684
<i>You're fine.</i>

46:11.185 --> 46:15.063
Just fine. You're doing great.
Now, just remember the academy.

46:15.731 --> 46:16.731
When you walk...

46:17.358 --> 46:21.570
<i>...move in a straight line. Don't</i>
<i>disturb any footprints he's left.</i>

46:21.863 --> 46:23.864
Yeah, assuming he's gone.

46:32.248 --> 46:34.040
<i>There's no footprints.</i>

46:34.500 --> 46:36.042
<i>There's nothing yet.</i>

46:51.559 --> 46:53.059
Oh, God.

46:53.686 --> 46:54.728
What?

46:55.813 --> 46:57.230
<i>Talk to me.</i>

46:58.399 --> 46:59.941
<i>Talk to me, Amelia.</i>

47:00.610 --> 47:02.402
I can see her.

47:08.075 --> 47:10.118
The steam pipe was opened...

47:10.411 --> 47:12.829
<i>...and she's tied down</i>
<i>right in front of it.</i>

47:13.247 --> 47:14.748
Okay.

47:14.957 --> 47:18.668
There's nothing you can do.
You can't do anything but help her...

47:18.920 --> 47:22.047
...by working the crime scene.
That's your job.

47:22.256 --> 47:25.342
<i>Open your suitcase.</i>
<i>Get your camera.</i>

48:08.719 --> 48:09.886
I can't do this.

48:10.846 --> 48:12.472
You can do it. Yes, you can.

48:12.682 --> 48:16.309
Yesterday you stopped a train.
You can do anything you want.

48:17.144 --> 48:19.145
Don't work me, Rhyme.

48:25.027 --> 48:26.903
<i>Just tell me what to do next.</i>

48:27.154 --> 48:30.031
Very slowly, walk the grid...

48:30.825 --> 48:33.159
<i>...one foot in front of the other.</i>

48:37.999 --> 48:41.042
<i>l want you to look around you now.</i>

48:41.252 --> 48:45.130
Crime scenes are three-dimensional.
Floors, walls and ceilings.

48:52.680 --> 48:53.680
Rhyme.

48:54.056 --> 48:55.432
<i>Yeah, l'm here.</i>

48:57.393 --> 48:59.185
There's something strange.

49:00.271 --> 49:02.147
<i>Things he left for us?</i>

49:06.944 --> 49:07.944
Yes.

49:08.863 --> 49:10.655
<i>ln a cluster again?</i>

49:10.865 --> 49:12.240
<i>A piece of wood...</i>

49:12.783 --> 49:14.868
<i>...and looks like some hair.</i>

49:15.161 --> 49:19.539
I'll walk you through collecting
the evidence. Do exactly as I say.

49:31.093 --> 49:32.552
Oh, Jesus.

49:32.762 --> 49:34.429
<i>Talk to me.</i>

49:34.680 --> 49:36.806
-lt's a bloody bone.
<i>-Where is it?</i>

49:38.893 --> 49:40.894
It's in my fucking hand.

49:41.729 --> 49:42.771
<i>Human?</i>

49:46.317 --> 49:48.068
I think so. Yeah.

49:48.736 --> 49:49.986
Photograph it.

49:50.780 --> 49:51.946
<i>Bag it.</i>

50:10.508 --> 50:11.966
Okay, that's it.

50:12.343 --> 50:13.843
I'm out of here.

50:14.428 --> 50:16.262
<i>One more thing.</i>

50:16.931 --> 50:18.765
We gotta process the body.

50:19.475 --> 50:22.811
<i>What? l'm not a medical examiner.</i>
<i>l can't do that.</i>

50:23.020 --> 50:24.479
<i>lt's not an autopsy.</i>

50:24.772 --> 50:26.606
I just want you to....

50:27.358 --> 50:29.234
Just describe the restraints.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.958
They're strange-looking handcuffs.

50:45.167 --> 50:48.044
They look more like
old shackles or something.

50:52.133 --> 50:54.968
<i>And there's a chain across her waist.</i>

50:56.262 --> 50:59.139
And her feet are bound with a rope.

51:01.809 --> 51:03.685
<i>Hands above her head?</i>

51:04.645 --> 51:06.020
Yeah.

51:10.192 --> 51:12.485
There's also a large
piece of flesh...

51:12.695 --> 51:15.363
<i>...missing from her right forearm.</i>

51:16.365 --> 51:19.784
It's right down to the bone.
It was surgically removed.

51:21.287 --> 51:22.829
This is what l want you to do.

51:23.330 --> 51:25.707
We're gonna need those handcuffs.

51:26.083 --> 51:29.169
<i>lt's probably our best chance</i>
<i>for good prints.</i>

51:29.420 --> 51:31.421
The M.E. can remove them.

51:31.672 --> 51:35.425
M.E. is all thumbs.
They'll mess up the prints.

51:35.676 --> 51:39.220
Look in the suitcase.
There's a small saw.

51:47.813 --> 51:49.022
Okay.

51:49.815 --> 51:52.692
I want you to saw her hands off
at the wrist line.

51:53.194 --> 51:55.862
<i>We gotta have those cuffs for prints.</i>

52:19.220 --> 52:20.220
I can't.

52:20.554 --> 52:23.223
Cut her hands off.
We need the handcuffs.

52:23.766 --> 52:24.974
I can't. No.

52:25.476 --> 52:27.101
Saw off her hands.

52:27.394 --> 52:28.978
<i>Take off the cuffs.</i>

52:29.730 --> 52:30.730
I can't.

52:31.106 --> 52:33.316
Listen to me.
We need those cuffs.

52:33.484 --> 52:34.484
I can't!

52:34.735 --> 52:37.111
-Amelia, we need--
-No! Fuck you!

52:39.615 --> 52:41.908
Amelia! Amelia!

52:47.414 --> 52:51.125
If he wants her hands cut off,
he can come and do it himself!

52:56.841 --> 53:00.760
Amelia? Amelia.

53:05.891 --> 53:07.684
Amelia.

53:25.536 --> 53:27.620
That'll be $1 6.50.

55:48.887 --> 55:52.765
Hello? Who is it?

56:07.823 --> 56:09.323
Hello?

56:48.864 --> 56:50.323
Hey, take it easy!

56:50.783 --> 56:53.993
-Shit! Solomon, what are you doing?
-Are you okay?

56:54.203 --> 56:56.162
What the fuck are you doing?

56:56.413 --> 56:59.040
Rhyme's been trying
to call you for hours.

56:59.541 --> 57:02.001
Your phone's down.
He was concerned.

57:02.753 --> 57:04.504
My phone's fine.

57:04.671 --> 57:06.506
I don't need his concern.

57:07.257 --> 57:09.675
He needs you at his place right away.

57:10.886 --> 57:13.221
I don't work for Lincoln Rhyme.

57:14.890 --> 57:17.892
He thinks the evidence says
there's another vic in play.

57:18.519 --> 57:20.728
And he's laying that at my feet?

57:21.396 --> 57:23.189
Don't shoot the messenger.

57:45.087 --> 57:47.046
Did you just move in?

57:47.297 --> 57:49.048
Yeah, about a year ago.

57:53.720 --> 57:54.720
Really?

58:12.573 --> 58:13.573
You were a model.

58:14.741 --> 58:18.286
-Yeah, when l was a kid.
-Kid model to street cop.

58:19.246 --> 58:20.246
There's a leap.

58:23.750 --> 58:25.585
For whatever it's worth...

58:27.588 --> 58:30.590
...l thought what you did today
was terrific.

59:12.674 --> 59:14.884
Hey, you guys, l'm out of here.

59:15.302 --> 59:17.678
I'll grab a cab.
I got a paper to finish.

59:17.888 --> 59:19.388
-l'm gonna hang.
-No problem.

59:19.640 --> 59:21.349
I'll be there in a minute.

59:22.309 --> 59:23.476
Can l finish that?

59:23.685 --> 59:25.144
Go for it.

59:29.983 --> 59:31.817
Okay, l'll see you outside.

59:39.618 --> 59:40.660
Taxi!

59:50.504 --> 59:53.005
That bone's definitely not human.

59:53.215 --> 59:56.008
-And the hair?
-Not human either.

59:56.301 --> 59:57.677
Well, what is it?

59:58.053 --> 01:00:00.179
I'm working as fast as l can.

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:04.517
Glad to see you could join us.

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:08.312
I got Cheney on the line.
He wants you to brief him.

01:00:08.689 --> 01:00:10.564
Tell him l'll call him back.

01:00:12.859 --> 01:00:17.446
Two things. First, you did
a hell of a job locating the evidence.

01:00:17.698 --> 01:00:20.199
There's no question the perp
knows forensics.

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:24.370
Now, as for the other thing...

01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:31.544
...the victim's hands, well, maybe...

01:00:33.714 --> 01:00:35.881
...it was too much to handle.
Forget it.

01:00:37.217 --> 01:00:38.884
Is that your version of an apology?

01:00:39.553 --> 01:00:41.220
An apology?

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:43.931
Is that why you came over here?

01:00:44.766 --> 01:00:46.392
You really are a piece of work.

01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:48.436
Well, aren't we a pair?

01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:52.898
I think you're terrific.

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:58.946
You got a hell of an arrest record.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:04.160
High marks from all your bosses.
Definite gold-shield potential.

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:08.080
Why you wanna throw it away
to chase youth offenders?

01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:11.667
I have no need to explain
that to you.

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:13.377
Come on, cop to cop.

01:01:13.754 --> 01:01:17.256
Cop to cop, let's just leave it
at personal reasons.

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:18.758
Okay.

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:22.511
Doesn't have anything to do
with your father, does it?

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:31.479
You keep charging at walls.

01:01:31.772 --> 01:01:33.898
Stubbornness is something
we both share.

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:39.028
They say we come into this world
with a preordained destiny.

01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:41.280
I don't believe it.

01:01:41.782 --> 01:01:45.451
Neither of my parents had
more than an eighth-grade education.

01:01:45.952 --> 01:01:49.205
Never read more than one book
between them, not one.

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:50.956
I've read thousands.

01:01:51.333 --> 01:01:52.792
I've written a dozen.

01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:54.001
What's your point?

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:58.422
My point is that destiny is
what you make it.

01:02:01.176 --> 01:02:04.136
What happened to your dad
won't necessarily happen to you.

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:08.140
You're a great cop.
You'd make a terrific detective.

01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:11.310
It's a gift.

01:02:12.813 --> 01:02:14.647
Don't throw it away.

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:23.656
Report from the Taxi Commission.

01:02:23.824 --> 01:02:26.325
An NYU student was abducted
last night.

01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:28.702
His girlfriend saw him
try to get out...

01:02:28.995 --> 01:02:31.831
...as the taxi driver
hit him with a flashlight.

01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:33.833
No description of the driver.

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:37.169
Okay, everybody.
This could be our next victim.

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:44.677
Did you get a deadline
off that evidence yet?

01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:47.304
Not yet.

01:02:47.514 --> 01:02:49.849
That's something I hoped
you'd help me with.

01:04:17.938 --> 01:04:20.314
Anyone for some osso buco?

01:04:21.066 --> 01:04:22.107
What?

01:04:22.567 --> 01:04:25.611
The bone we found
at the Wall Street scene.

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:29.156
Veal shank.
Braised and overly salted to boot.

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:30.783
A cow bone?

01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:35.287
I also found a piece
of that old paper...

01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:37.414
...embedded in the bone.

01:04:37.624 --> 01:04:38.749
Take a look.

01:04:43.672 --> 01:04:46.590
-What's going on?
-Do what you need to do quickly.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.968
The hair follicles,
they're not human.

01:04:49.177 --> 01:04:50.970
A rodent. Probably a rat.

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:52.763
They were shaved off.

01:04:52.973 --> 01:04:55.099
We're looking for a rat that shaves.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.185
-l really like that.
-l've known a few in my time.

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:01.480
-How about you, Amelia?
-More than a few.

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:05.109
He's consistent with underground,
that's for sure.

01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:09.196
What's he trying to say?
He's communicating in our language...

01:05:09.447 --> 01:05:11.574
...leaving clues,
forensic clues at that.

01:05:11.992 --> 01:05:13.200
Maybe it's a cop.

01:05:14.286 --> 01:05:15.494
Maybe.

01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:19.206
Maybe he's sharing the responsibility
of these murders.

01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:22.459
If we don't figure out the clues,
the blood's on our hands.

01:05:22.961 --> 01:05:26.630
If we can't find the victim, we're as
responsible for the murders as he is.

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:29.842
What do you got
on that dirt from the wood?

01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:33.887
I don't have 1 00% individuated,
but it does appear nitrogen-rich.

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:35.598
Ready to rock 'n' roll.

01:05:35.849 --> 01:05:38.183
-Thanks for rushing. I appreciate it.
-All right.

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:40.519
Thank you, Richard.

01:05:40.729 --> 01:05:45.107
Nitrogen-rich, explosive carbons.
Where do you find those in New York?

01:05:45.483 --> 01:05:47.151
Bomb sites.

01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:50.988
-Shooting ranges.
-Maybe an old fort or an armoury?

01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:52.865
Don't forget the shit factor.

01:05:53.241 --> 01:05:54.241
The what?

01:05:55.327 --> 01:05:58.037
Manure becomes a nitrate
when it's aged.

01:05:58.246 --> 01:05:59.413
That's true.

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:02.166
Then you got cow bones, huh?

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:06.128
Old cow bones. Old manure.
Turn-of-the-century.

01:06:06.504 --> 01:06:09.256
Cows, farms, pastures.

01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:10.633
Rats.

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:13.010
Dead cows.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.722
Where do you find--?
In stockyards.

01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:20.267
Look for slaughterhouses.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.896
Stockyards and slaughterhouses
from turn of the century.

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:25.147
Check the Internet.

01:06:25.357 --> 01:06:30.361
I want tax records, sanitation records
and building-code inspections.

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:32.237
Last 1 00 years. Okay?

01:07:15.448 --> 01:07:17.825
Man, your blood pressure is way up.

01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:25.624
-You're pushing it too hard.
-l understand.

01:07:25.834 --> 01:07:29.294
-What do we got on the stockyards?
-We're almost there.

01:07:29.963 --> 01:07:30.963
You okay?

01:07:31.256 --> 01:07:32.464
No, I'm not okay.

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:38.303
I can't figure out this time line
or these shards of cardboard.

01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:40.639
We got three defunct stockyard sites.

01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:43.475
One on Lexington
and the Harlem River viaduct.

01:07:43.768 --> 01:07:45.352
Solomon, put the box down...

01:07:45.603 --> 01:07:49.148
...turn the viewer on and mark it down
as she calls them off.

01:07:49.357 --> 01:07:52.651
Your blood pressure will blow a gasket
if you don't slow down.

01:07:53.027 --> 01:07:56.780
My body has a mind of its own.
It doesn't listen to me.

01:07:57.449 --> 01:07:58.449
What else?

01:07:59.325 --> 01:08:02.161
There's another on the Hudson
up at 1 55th.

01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:03.871
Mark it down, Solomon.

01:08:04.122 --> 01:08:05.831
Your sats are going down.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.167
You saw him have a seizure.

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:09.334
What else?

01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:12.296
There's one underground
at Greenwich and Houston.

01:08:12.464 --> 01:08:13.464
Mark it down.

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.509
-Why don't you knock it off?
-l don't need to knock it off!

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:30.481
What was the first one
you mentioned?

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:33.024
Lexington and
the Harlem River viaduct.

01:08:33.193 --> 01:08:34.401
When did it close?

01:08:34.652 --> 01:08:35.652
1 91 0.

01:08:35.862 --> 01:08:37.154
Okay, what about...

01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:39.865
...Houston and Greenwich?

01:08:40.073 --> 01:08:41.200
1 898.

01:08:41.533 --> 01:08:44.995
And Hudson and 1 55th
was closed in 1 906.

01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:48.165
1 906, 1 898--

01:08:50.502 --> 01:08:53.212
All right, let's....
1 898.

01:08:54.171 --> 01:08:57.925
Houston and Greenwich. Call
Emergency Services and tell them...

01:08:58.843 --> 01:09:01.094
...to meet us
at Houston and Greenwich.

01:09:01.345 --> 01:09:04.723
Solomon, you get on to Hanson.
He'll need about 20 guys.

01:09:07.352 --> 01:09:08.393
You go with them.

01:09:08.812 --> 01:09:10.062
Let's go.

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:31.207
Linc, you there?

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:33.335
Yeah, ready.

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:34.877
<i>We're here.</i>

01:09:36.214 --> 01:09:40.175
-Okay. Amelia?
-Yeah.

01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:43.428
<i>All right. Same drill.</i>
<i>l want you in first.</i>

01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:46.932
Let's do it.

01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:13.625
You watch yourself, Amelia.

01:10:19.591 --> 01:10:21.508
Oh, man. I don't like this.

01:10:22.135 --> 01:10:24.094
I don't like this.

01:10:27.265 --> 01:10:29.391
I got a bad feeling about this.

01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:32.644
<i>All three of us ought to</i>
<i>get in there.</i>

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:34.605
Not yet. Just hold back.

01:10:41.529 --> 01:10:43.447
<i>l'm going down some stairs.</i>

01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:47.826
Cement walls.

01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:55.167
Wood crates.

01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:57.210
Large columns.

01:10:59.797 --> 01:11:02.007
<i>Smells like manure down here.</i>

01:11:02.634 --> 01:11:04.509
<i>Ortiz sure knows his shit.</i>

01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:07.679
Always has.

01:11:09.641 --> 01:11:11.433
Metal hooks...

01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:13.977
...and a pen.

01:11:15.188 --> 01:11:17.022
It's a slaughterhouse.

01:11:30.745 --> 01:11:33.538
-Get inside, guys.
-Go, go, go.

01:11:35.249 --> 01:11:36.458
<i>ESU are here.</i>

01:11:36.668 --> 01:11:39.836
Hold them off. Don't want them
contaminating the scene.

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:43.966
All right, hold it.
Hold up. Hold up.

01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:45.592
-You're not to go in.
-Why?

01:11:45.843 --> 01:11:49.096
-Rhyme's orders.
-Fuck him! Get me Cheney on the line.

01:11:50.181 --> 01:11:51.598
<i>Crime scene C.O. on air.</i>

01:11:52.392 --> 01:11:56.061
<i>-Switch to channel 2-2 for ESU.</i>
-Fuck Rhyme.

01:12:06.739 --> 01:12:08.365
Maybe this one's still alive.

01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:10.617
Perp didn't leave a deadline.

01:12:10.868 --> 01:12:12.285
<i>What does that mean?</i>

01:12:13.788 --> 01:12:15.497
We're probably too late.

01:12:15.707 --> 01:12:17.249
You don't know that, Rhyme.

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:19.418
Get off the line.

01:12:20.795 --> 01:12:22.546
Let's move on, Amelia.

01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:28.385
There's five basic contaminants
to every crime scene.

01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:30.804
I'll skip to the worst one.

01:12:31.389 --> 01:12:32.931
<i>Other cops.</i>

01:12:40.023 --> 01:12:41.523
I think I hear something.

01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:47.779
I hate this shit.

01:12:57.123 --> 01:12:58.457
<i>l see something.</i>

01:13:18.436 --> 01:13:19.561
<i>l think I found him.</i>

01:13:20.146 --> 01:13:22.481
<i>l can't tell if he's alive.</i>

01:13:26.319 --> 01:13:28.987
Oh, Jesus. He's covered in rats.

01:13:30.114 --> 01:13:31.573
<i>They're all over him.</i>

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:44.711
-We're going in.
-No, you're not. No, you're not!

01:13:51.344 --> 01:13:52.677
Go! Go!

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:55.514
<i>Central, we have shots fired.</i>
<i>Shots fired.</i>

01:14:12.532 --> 01:14:15.742
<i>You were right. We never had a shot.</i>

01:14:17.036 --> 01:14:20.372
He cut him up pretty bad
and left him for the rats.

01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:24.251
There's a cut in his leg
down to the bone.

01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:28.046
<i>The blood attracted the rats.</i>

01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:35.428
Goddamn son of a bitch.

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:45.564
You okay?

01:14:53.698 --> 01:14:55.198
I'm fine.

01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:57.909
Step aside so l can walk the grid.

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:04.583
Let's give her some room.

01:15:04.876 --> 01:15:06.418
Move out, guys.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:11.882
<i>-Rhyme, l'm gonna walk the grid.</i>
-Okay.

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:14.384
You know what to do.

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:36.323
Rhyme, I found it.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.491
Another cluster.

01:15:39.452 --> 01:15:41.745
<i>A piece of old paper</i>
<i>like the other two.</i>

01:15:42.121 --> 01:15:43.580
<i>And a matchbox.</i>

01:15:44.498 --> 01:15:46.958
Bring that black suitcase over here.

01:15:49.921 --> 01:15:51.963
<i>Pull out the brown envelope.</i>

01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:58.970
Sounds like you're starting
to enjoy this work.

01:16:04.477 --> 01:16:06.728
Damn! The press is here.

01:16:10.483 --> 01:16:11.524
Park it right there.

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:18.949
Lincoln Rhyme is no longer working
this case. I'm taking over.

01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:22.869
Do what you want to do, but you
ought to check with Murphy first.

01:16:23.162 --> 01:16:25.038
Fuck Murphy and fuck Rhyme.

01:16:25.539 --> 01:16:29.125
<i>This has been cleared downtown.</i>
<i>We got a dead kid on our hands...</i>

01:16:29.335 --> 01:16:32.545
...and l, for one, am not taking
the heat for that.

01:16:33.339 --> 01:16:36.883
Tell Ortiz and his crew to vacate
Rhyme's place tonight.

01:16:37.385 --> 01:16:39.678
The victim was already dead
when we arrived.

01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:43.181
And you, half-assed patrolman
working a crime scene...

01:16:43.641 --> 01:16:45.183
...those days are over.

01:16:45.351 --> 01:16:47.352
I'll take that evidence bag now.

01:16:47.687 --> 01:16:50.188
You can take it with
a chain-of-custody voucher, sir.

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:54.567
Are you out of your mind?

01:16:59.532 --> 01:17:01.366
<i>Let's go. You're coming with us.</i>

01:17:01.534 --> 01:17:02.867
<i>Are you arresting me?</i>

01:17:03.077 --> 01:17:06.538
<i>Just get in the car and keep</i>
<i>your mouth shut to the press.</i>

01:17:21.345 --> 01:17:24.347
You won't find any prints.
He's too good for that.

01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:35.567
It looks like we have a nice,
clean friction print.

01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:38.903
Unless of course, it's yours.

01:17:40.114 --> 01:17:42.115
No, I was wearing gloves.

01:17:42.742 --> 01:17:44.534
We'll know soon enough.

01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:46.411
Put this through.
Highest priority.

01:17:46.704 --> 01:17:48.705
-You got it.
-Thank you.

01:17:59.967 --> 01:18:03.094
I got a feeling this perp's been
in business for a long time.

01:18:03.346 --> 01:18:06.598
I hear you, but you know,
it's Cheney's problem now.

01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:08.933
Yeah, that's what scares me.

01:18:09.143 --> 01:18:12.896
See if there's been
any homicides in the last 1 2 months...

01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:16.858
...involving surgically-removed flesh
exposing bone.

01:18:18.152 --> 01:18:19.778
No problem.

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:23.114
-See you soon.
-Hope so, Eddie.

01:18:23.282 --> 01:18:26.284
Thelma, don't you let him
run no circles around you.

01:18:26.494 --> 01:18:28.286
Stay right, Eddie.

01:18:46.889 --> 01:18:50.809
Oh, that print. We just got
a positive ID on it.

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:55.647
The guy has three
extremely violent priors.

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:57.482
Oh, look at that.

01:18:57.691 --> 01:18:59.401
Taxi licence, no less.

01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:00.819
We got him.

01:19:01.112 --> 01:19:02.320
Let's go, boys!

01:19:02.488 --> 01:19:03.822
Somebody call ESU.

01:19:21.799 --> 01:19:25.009
Now slide out, nice and easy.

01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:39.858
That explains your print.

01:19:55.833 --> 01:19:57.083
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:19:57.251 --> 01:19:59.210
He was hoping you'd show up.

01:20:01.547 --> 01:20:03.381
He's been worried about you.

01:20:03.674 --> 01:20:05.049
Yeah, sure.

01:20:12.892 --> 01:20:15.059
I didn't expect to see you again.

01:20:16.604 --> 01:20:18.062
Poor Cheney, huh?

01:20:18.272 --> 01:20:21.566
Grabbed the ball with both hands,
scored for the other team.

01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:26.362
I warned him that the perp was
too smart to leave a print.

01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:29.073
How you doing with that stuff?

01:20:30.242 --> 01:20:31.743
Not too good.

01:20:32.411 --> 01:20:35.914
Two pieces of the puzzle,
but I don't know what it means.

01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:40.084
Maybe this'll help.

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:43.546
Cheney will have your badge for that.

01:20:43.756 --> 01:20:46.257
He wouldn't give me
a voucher. What could I do?

01:20:46.842 --> 01:20:48.259
You could take it back to him.

01:20:49.595 --> 01:20:52.055
The man is a living monument
to ineptitude.

01:20:52.515 --> 01:20:54.557
True. Let's take a look.

01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:57.435
What do you got there?

01:20:58.604 --> 01:21:01.147
Third piece of the puzzle.

01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:04.526
There's something really strange
about it, though.

01:21:05.277 --> 01:21:07.028
You gotta smell it.

01:21:08.614 --> 01:21:09.948
Sure.

01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:13.660
-Well, you--
-Shoot.

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:22.794
-Sorry.
-lt's okay. Take your time.

01:21:33.597 --> 01:21:36.182
You have to put it closer to my nose.

01:21:40.271 --> 01:21:41.980
What do you think it is?

01:21:43.857 --> 01:21:45.108
Kerosene?

01:21:47.987 --> 01:21:49.320
Possibly.

01:21:50.155 --> 01:21:52.323
This just came in from Eddie Ortiz.

01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:55.159
Could you load these
into the computer for me?

01:21:55.452 --> 01:21:57.287
Sorry about that, Thelma.

01:21:57.997 --> 01:21:59.581
ECU.

01:21:59.832 --> 01:22:01.207
View scan.

01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:06.170
"Dear Linc, I am enclosing photos
of four unsolved homicides...

01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:08.590
...which took place
in the last 1 2 months.

01:22:08.841 --> 01:22:12.176
Flesh has been removed
from the victims' extremities.

01:22:12.469 --> 01:22:14.637
I miss you. Love, Eddie."

01:22:14.805 --> 01:22:17.056
I'll spare myself the pleasure
if you don't mind.

01:22:17.224 --> 01:22:18.808
Okay, Thelma.

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:22.312
Zoom.

01:22:25.357 --> 01:22:26.858
Same mark.

01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:28.860
Right.

01:22:29.612 --> 01:22:34.616
Zoom.

01:22:38.704 --> 01:22:40.413
Same messages.

01:22:44.418 --> 01:22:45.668
It's him.

01:22:47.212 --> 01:22:49.839
He was trying to make
contact even then.

01:22:51.717 --> 01:22:53.718
But Cheney never put it together.

01:22:57.848 --> 01:22:59.265
Thelma!

01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:02.352
Dysreflexia seizure. A bad one.

01:23:02.686 --> 01:23:05.063
Hang on. Hang on.
Breathe, Rhyme.

01:23:05.272 --> 01:23:06.731
Come on, breathe with me.

01:23:07.066 --> 01:23:09.067
Damn catheter's blocked.

01:23:09.443 --> 01:23:13.780
Just let me get a BP on you.
Stay with me! Breathe.

01:23:14.073 --> 01:23:15.740
Hang on. Hang on.

01:23:15.949 --> 01:23:17.867
Just let me check you.

01:23:19.453 --> 01:23:22.413
Diastolic's over 1 25.
I gotta get it down now.

01:23:28.712 --> 01:23:32.757
Just give it a few seconds to work.
Come on, breathe with me.

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:39.681
Come on.

01:23:42.685 --> 01:23:44.102
Hang on, man.

01:23:44.812 --> 01:23:46.312
Is he gonna make it?

01:23:47.106 --> 01:23:49.065
If he does, he won't be happy.

01:23:50.984 --> 01:23:52.777
What are you talking about?

01:23:54.279 --> 01:23:57.115
He's finalized arrangements
to self-terminate.

01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:05.707
He convinced some doctor to help
with his final transition, as he calls it.

01:24:07.126 --> 01:24:08.459
But suicide?

01:24:08.752 --> 01:24:10.420
It's the seizures.

01:24:10.963 --> 01:24:14.632
Any one of them could put him
into a vegetative state.

01:24:15.509 --> 01:24:18.261
That's what he fears
more than anything.

01:24:21.849 --> 01:24:22.849
Who is it?

01:24:23.475 --> 01:24:24.934
Captain Cheney.

01:24:25.436 --> 01:24:26.519
<i>Can l help you?</i>

01:24:27.604 --> 01:24:29.313
Police business. Open up.

01:24:29.815 --> 01:24:31.482
Mr. Rhyme is asleep.

01:24:32.276 --> 01:24:35.027
Well, wake him up.
I need to see him now.

01:24:38.157 --> 01:24:40.491
Let me deal with this asshole.
You watch him.

01:24:40.743 --> 01:24:43.161
Anything, just call me.
He's all right.

01:24:52.045 --> 01:24:53.379
Look, lady.

01:24:53.672 --> 01:24:57.383
I hope you know that obstructing
justice is a felony offence.

01:24:57.634 --> 01:24:58.885
Look, don't "lady" me.

01:24:59.136 --> 01:25:02.346
Unless you have a warrant,
you can't come in here.

01:25:02.639 --> 01:25:03.765
I'm coming in.

01:25:04.183 --> 01:25:07.685
I have reason to believe
there's stolen evidence in there.

01:25:09.146 --> 01:25:11.147
What's your full name?

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:13.065
Thelma what?

01:25:13.567 --> 01:25:15.026
So you wanna get official?

01:25:15.861 --> 01:25:17.695
What did you say your name was?

01:25:21.992 --> 01:25:24.869
You got a smart mouth
and it'll get you in trouble.

01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:28.790
It may bite your ass if you don't stop
aggravating my patient.

01:25:29.208 --> 01:25:31.667
I'm gonna leave now, but I'll be back.

01:25:31.877 --> 01:25:34.837
And when I come back,
it'll be with a warrant.

01:25:50.687 --> 01:25:52.563
And l looked everywhere.

01:25:52.815 --> 01:25:55.399
And l thought the conductor
would be angry.

01:25:55.609 --> 01:25:58.903
And l kept searching everywhere,
and finally...

01:25:59.112 --> 01:26:01.072
...it was right on my lap.

01:26:05.536 --> 01:26:08.120
Grandma can't wait to see you,
you know.

01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:03.634
What'd I do?

01:27:03.802 --> 01:27:06.470
You're carrying a fare
and your meter's not on...

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:09.140
...and your hack licence is
not properly--

01:28:12.454 --> 01:28:15.998
There's laws against molesting
the handicapped, you know.

01:28:18.377 --> 01:28:20.002
Yeah?

01:28:23.966 --> 01:28:26.008
I wasn't a pretty sight, was l?

01:28:32.099 --> 01:28:35.059
Thelma told me about your plans
for your final transition.

01:28:39.856 --> 01:28:43.025
Cop to cop, that subject's
not open to discussion.

01:28:45.904 --> 01:28:47.405
Why? Would you miss me?

01:28:48.407 --> 01:28:51.242
Well, destiny's what we make it,
right?

01:28:53.495 --> 01:28:54.578
Touché.

01:28:54.788 --> 01:28:57.915
You seem to have your reasons
for checking out.

01:28:58.417 --> 01:29:00.501
I expected more
from someone like you.

01:29:00.919 --> 01:29:02.753
Well, l might surprise you...

01:29:04.423 --> 01:29:05.548
...and live forever.

01:29:06.258 --> 01:29:08.092
Nothing you'd do
would surprise me.

01:29:08.385 --> 01:29:11.262
Well, look who's still
in the land of the living.

01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:13.097
For the moment.

01:29:13.306 --> 01:29:15.766
Cheney was here
huffing and puffing.

01:29:16.018 --> 01:29:19.603
-He promised to return with a warrant.
-Sorry I missed him.

01:29:20.897 --> 01:29:22.565
If that's him, tell him...

01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:25.234
-Say no more.
-...I'm skiing.

01:29:25.986 --> 01:29:27.153
Hello.

01:29:27.612 --> 01:29:29.530
Hey, Paulie. Hang on.

01:29:30.449 --> 01:29:32.783
I don't know if it's
just a coincidence...

01:29:33.035 --> 01:29:36.620
...but an inspector was killed
by a cabby who was off the meter.

01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:40.458
The thing is, a male witness
who wouldn't give his name...

01:29:40.667 --> 01:29:44.295
<i>...saw the taxi with</i>
<i>an old man and a little girl inside.</i>

01:29:44.463 --> 01:29:46.297
Probably the doer that called.

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:48.466
Jesus, he's got a kid.

01:29:48.967 --> 01:29:50.634
And an old man.

01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:52.762
-Thank you, Paulie.
<i>-Okay.</i>

01:29:54.139 --> 01:29:57.266
We'd better look closer
at that third piece of the puzzle.

01:29:57.476 --> 01:29:58.851
Close.

01:29:59.478 --> 01:30:03.064
Three murders.
Three evidence clusters.

01:30:04.775 --> 01:30:06.817
Three pieces of paper.

01:30:06.985 --> 01:30:08.444
View scan.

01:30:21.666 --> 01:30:24.085
You're the queen of puzzles.
What do you see?

01:30:25.796 --> 01:30:27.671
I'm looking. I'm looking.

01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:30.007
Lower the little one.

01:30:31.093 --> 01:30:32.218
That one.

01:30:37.682 --> 01:30:39.391
Twist that big one around.

01:30:51.196 --> 01:30:55.616
Doesn't that kind of look like a face?
Mouth, nose, eye.

01:30:56.201 --> 01:30:57.201
Enhance.

01:30:58.703 --> 01:30:59.995
Fade.

01:31:02.541 --> 01:31:03.707
A woman's face.

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:08.546
Yes, it is.

01:31:09.673 --> 01:31:11.215
It's a logo.

01:31:12.259 --> 01:31:13.551
An old...

01:31:13.844 --> 01:31:15.845
...turn-of-the-century...

01:31:16.054 --> 01:31:17.847
...publisher's logo.

01:31:18.557 --> 01:31:19.765
You know it?

01:31:20.767 --> 01:31:24.562
I used to own a few of the books.
Gothic stories.

01:31:26.231 --> 01:31:27.690
Crime stories.

01:31:28.775 --> 01:31:31.694
The killer is pointing us
to an old book.

01:31:57.596 --> 01:31:59.221
Can l help you?

01:32:03.101 --> 01:32:05.311
I called about old crime books.

01:32:06.271 --> 01:32:08.606
Around the corner. Help yourself.

01:32:09.482 --> 01:32:10.900
Thanks.

01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:32.022
<i>Aviation Two to Central.</i>

01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:34.984
<i>We're taking a flyby</i>
<i>at the Brooklyn Bridge.</i>

01:33:35.193 --> 01:33:38.487
<i>Report appears unfounded</i>
<i>at this time.</i>

01:33:38.905 --> 01:33:41.907
<i>Will check East River</i>
<i>shoreline and advise.</i>

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:45.160
I need more small boats
to search under the piers.

01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:47.913
By the heliport. Under the piers.

01:33:48.707 --> 01:33:50.833
It was the last murder in the book.

01:33:51.042 --> 01:33:53.085
They've gotta be along the shore.

01:33:53.378 --> 01:33:55.838
<i>Listen, the lab says</i>
<i>the odour we smelled...</i>

01:33:56.047 --> 01:33:59.425
...on the third piece of the puzzle is
probably diesel fuel.

01:33:59.718 --> 01:34:03.929
<i>There's an old boat refueling station</i>
<i>at the Staten lsland Ferry pier.</i>

01:34:04.222 --> 01:34:06.849
<i>Check the pilings under the pier.</i>

01:34:53.438 --> 01:34:54.438
Found them!

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:56.440
Over here!

01:34:56.608 --> 01:34:59.610
Here!

01:34:59.986 --> 01:35:01.779
<i>l can see someone with a light...</i>

<i>...signalling us from</i>

<i>Be advised, subject signalling is</i>
<i>most likely NYPD officer.</i>

01:35:25.303 --> 01:35:27.971
Over here! Here!

01:35:35.647 --> 01:35:37.314
Watch the pilings!

01:35:40.527 --> 01:35:43.612
<i>We've got divers</i>
<i>coming in to you now.</i>

01:35:48.201 --> 01:35:49.326

<i>out of the water...</i>

01:36:05.677 --> 01:36:08.720
-Rhyme, are you there?
-Yeah.

01:36:09.222 --> 01:36:10.556
<i>Looks like we're too late.</i>

01:36:11.724 --> 01:36:13.225
Forget it. He's dead.

01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:18.188
The old man's gone.

01:36:19.190 --> 01:36:22.192
<i>They're working on the girl,</i>
<i>but it doesn't look good.</i>

01:36:26.698 --> 01:36:28.866
Try again.
I know she's still there.

01:36:29.075 --> 01:36:31.577
Come on, kid. Come on. Try for me.

01:36:32.745 --> 01:36:34.580
<i>Come on. You can do it.</i>

01:36:35.206 --> 01:36:36.373
Come on.

01:36:37.041 --> 01:36:40.544
Breathe.

01:36:44.883 --> 01:36:46.175
She's breathing.

01:36:46.384 --> 01:36:49.386
She'll be okay.
She's breathing. Can you hear me?

01:36:49.721 --> 01:36:52.848
<i>-l think she's gonna make it.</i>
-Good. Good.

01:36:54.726 --> 01:36:58.020
<i>You gotta find the clues</i>
<i>that he left for us.</i>

01:36:58.563 --> 01:37:01.398
See what you can find
around the fuel tanks.

01:37:01.691 --> 01:37:02.858
<i>All right.</i>

01:37:27.425 --> 01:37:28.550
I found it.

01:37:29.636 --> 01:37:32.596
It's a map of some kind,
some chunk of a clean bone...

01:37:32.764 --> 01:37:35.724
<i>...and a piece of a medal</i>
<i>or a badge or something.</i>

01:37:38.269 --> 01:37:40.854
There's initials engraved.
It looks like...

01:37:41.356 --> 01:37:43.565
...a P and a B.

01:37:45.902 --> 01:37:47.361
It's definitely a D.

01:37:48.279 --> 01:37:50.280
P.D. Sounds like a cop's badge.

01:37:51.616 --> 01:37:53.116
Think he'll kill a cop?

01:37:54.369 --> 01:37:55.744
Could be.

01:37:56.955 --> 01:37:59.081
-Thelma.
-Maps?

01:38:01.042 --> 01:38:02.793
Tell me about the map.

01:38:03.628 --> 01:38:05.420
Looks like an old subway map.

01:38:06.422 --> 01:38:08.382
I don't recognise the stations.

01:38:10.009 --> 01:38:12.636
When I scanned asbestos sites,
I came across...

01:38:12.887 --> 01:38:15.305
<i>...stations that aren't</i>
<i>in use anymore.</i>

01:38:16.057 --> 01:38:18.267
There it is. The oldest station.

01:38:18.768 --> 01:38:23.063
On your map, is there an old station
indicated at the tip of Manhattan?

01:38:26.150 --> 01:38:27.484
Navy Street.

01:38:28.903 --> 01:38:30.779
<i>lt's right next to the pier.</i>

01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:32.281
Oh, shit.

01:38:32.490 --> 01:38:34.116
Cheney's here.

01:38:38.788 --> 01:38:41.790
You talking to Rhyme on that thing?
Give me the radio.

01:38:43.668 --> 01:38:47.170
This is Cheney. What the hell
do you think you're doing?

01:38:47.755 --> 01:38:49.840
<i>Stealing evidence is</i>
<i>a goddamn felony.</i>

01:38:50.133 --> 01:38:52.676
I understand there's no
chain-of-evidence voucher.

01:38:52.969 --> 01:38:55.137
<i>Oh, yeah? l got some news for you.</i>

01:38:55.471 --> 01:38:57.681
You're not a cop anymore.
Understand?

01:38:58.182 --> 01:39:00.684
<i>What you are is</i>
<i>a fucking meddling cripple.</i>

01:39:01.185 --> 01:39:03.812
I'm gonna place your little gofer
under arrest.

01:39:04.022 --> 01:39:05.814
<i>You don't mind that, do you?</i>

01:39:07.108 --> 01:39:08.525
Lock her up.

01:39:10.862 --> 01:39:12.279
Where'd she go?

01:39:36.971 --> 01:39:38.972
<i>l'm inside the Navy Street tunnel.</i>

01:39:39.182 --> 01:39:42.225
<i>There's grey dust everywhere.</i>
<i>lt's all over my shoes.</i>

01:39:48.650 --> 01:39:49.816
There's footprints.

01:39:50.526 --> 01:39:52.110
One set of footprints.

01:39:53.571 --> 01:39:55.238
Hello? Lincoln, hello?

01:39:55.406 --> 01:39:57.783
Amelia? Hello?

01:39:57.950 --> 01:40:01.328
<i>The mobile unit you've called</i>
<i>is not responding.</i>

01:40:01.579 --> 01:40:02.746
Re-call.

01:41:03.933 --> 01:41:05.308
No dust.

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:07.394
He changed the numbers.

01:41:08.438 --> 01:41:10.772
7-8-4-9-9. What is that?

01:41:11.482 --> 01:41:13.650
7-8-4-9-9.

01:41:15.069 --> 01:41:18.655
What does it mean?

01:41:36.841 --> 01:41:38.967
<i>Help me, Rhyme. Help me.</i>

01:41:55.526 --> 01:41:57.235
He's gonna kill Rhyme.

01:42:19.801 --> 01:42:21.218
Coming.

01:42:26.724 --> 01:42:29.351
Hey, what are you doing here?

01:42:50.706 --> 01:42:51.915
Thelma?

01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:54.584
Is that Amelia?

01:42:58.256 --> 01:42:59.256
Bed mode.

01:43:07.807 --> 01:43:09.432
Thelma?

01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:19.818
Thelma, is that you?

01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:29.411
No, it's me. Richard.

01:43:30.746 --> 01:43:32.581
Richard? What's up?

01:43:33.457 --> 01:43:36.877
Thelma asked me to come by,
check the heart-pacing machine.

01:43:48.639 --> 01:43:49.764
Where is Thelma?

01:43:49.974 --> 01:43:51.474
Out in the hall.

01:44:09.827 --> 01:44:11.161
Phone mode.

01:44:20.588 --> 01:44:23.173
It was time we had
a quiet moment together.

01:44:23.466 --> 01:44:27.260
-You and l, no interruptions.
-Okay.

01:44:27.637 --> 01:44:29.012
What's on your mind?

01:44:29.305 --> 01:44:32.182
I think it's time to set
the record straight.

01:44:33.684 --> 01:44:35.310
Syracuse.

01:44:35.519 --> 01:44:38.021
You remember Syracuse, don't you?

01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:40.815
You wrote an expert opinion.

01:44:41.192 --> 01:44:42.943
I wrote thousands of opinions.

01:44:43.194 --> 01:44:46.529
Don't fucking tell me
you don't remember Syracuse.

01:44:46.864 --> 01:44:49.699
They called it an investigation.
It was a witch hunt.

01:44:50.409 --> 01:44:54.287
There was a forensics cop
up in Syracuse, New York.

01:44:54.872 --> 01:44:56.456
Marcus Andrews.

01:44:56.874 --> 01:44:59.417
Okay, that was the cop
that was suspected...

01:44:59.669 --> 01:45:02.879
...of tampering with evidence
in some homicide cases.

01:45:03.130 --> 01:45:06.466
-Nothing was tampered with.
-Six innocent people went to jail.

01:45:06.884 --> 01:45:10.553
They went to jail because
they were guilty. They were scum.

01:45:10.805 --> 01:45:13.682
-He doctored the reports.
-Nothing was doctored.

01:45:13.933 --> 01:45:15.642
He planted blood evidence.

01:45:15.851 --> 01:45:18.228
My work was impeccable.

01:45:19.563 --> 01:45:21.439
Where are we going with this...

01:45:23.359 --> 01:45:24.943
...Marcus?

01:45:29.490 --> 01:45:31.741
Your report destroyed my life.

01:45:31.993 --> 01:45:34.077
My report was not a legal finding.

01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:37.706
-You never let me defend myself.
-l never even met you.

01:45:37.915 --> 01:45:40.417
I was sent to prison for six years!

01:45:40.876 --> 01:45:43.086
I spent two more years
getting to you.

01:45:43.337 --> 01:45:46.006
Do you know what happens
to a cop in jail?

01:45:46.424 --> 01:45:49.342
Every day, every single day...

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:54.264
...over and over, l was brutalized.
I became a human toilet...

01:45:54.473 --> 01:45:56.099
...because of your expert opinion.

01:45:56.350 --> 01:46:00.770
Well, you will never point the finger
of blame at anyone ever again.

01:46:02.898 --> 01:46:05.358
You were never as good as they said.

01:46:05.568 --> 01:46:07.944
I played you. I tested you.

01:46:08.112 --> 01:46:09.904
I gave you every clue.

01:46:10.114 --> 01:46:12.407
You and your helper
couldn't save them.

01:46:12.616 --> 01:46:14.993
Their blood is on your hands.
You failed.

01:46:15.202 --> 01:46:16.995
You failed, you fuck.

01:46:17.204 --> 01:46:20.623
Game of chess, Mr. Rhyme.
Some people win. Some people lose.

01:46:20.916 --> 01:46:23.710
I win, Mr. Rhyme. l win. You lose.

01:46:27.757 --> 01:46:30.133
What kind of vegetable
would you like to be?

01:46:30.718 --> 01:46:31.718
A carrot?

01:46:35.723 --> 01:46:37.307
How about a zucchini?

01:46:39.727 --> 01:46:40.769
Zucchini?

01:46:41.103 --> 01:46:42.479
You wanna be a zucchini?

01:46:42.646 --> 01:46:45.815
-Thelma!
-l'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

01:46:46.776 --> 01:46:48.777
Did you say zucchini?

01:47:26.273 --> 01:47:27.982
You want to play?

01:47:40.204 --> 01:47:42.789
Shall we cut out your tongue,
Mr. Rhyme?

01:47:44.208 --> 01:47:46.334
How about your eye? Your eye?

01:47:46.544 --> 01:47:48.628
I'll just pop it out of there.

01:47:48.879 --> 01:47:50.630
Let's leave that for now.

01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:52.173
You can watch me.

01:47:52.383 --> 01:47:56.845
You can watch me while l gut you
open right down the middle.

01:48:02.184 --> 01:48:07.605
What?

01:48:45.519 --> 01:48:48.313
Can you hear me? Lincoln?

01:48:48.856 --> 01:48:50.565
Oh, God.

01:48:54.612 --> 01:48:56.863
Step aside.
We'll take care of him.

01:49:48.999 --> 01:49:52.919
-l've always loved this view.
-l like it too, doc.

01:49:54.004 --> 01:49:56.256
It's looking better every day.

01:49:57.675 --> 01:49:58.841
How you guys doing?

01:49:59.093 --> 01:50:00.426
Good.

01:50:06.767 --> 01:50:09.018
You got an operating licence for that?

01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:11.479
I got a learner's permit.

01:50:18.112 --> 01:50:21.322
-How's your boyfriend?
-He's in Florida. He play golf.

01:50:21.532 --> 01:50:22.865
Playing golf?

01:50:23.117 --> 01:50:25.034
Captain Flash on wheels.

01:50:25.244 --> 01:50:27.954
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, everyone.

01:50:28.205 --> 01:50:30.873
If you'll be cruising,
you might as well be amusing.

01:50:31.333 --> 01:50:33.501
-There you go.
-Thank you, Eddie.

01:50:38.048 --> 01:50:39.048
Come on in.

01:50:39.258 --> 01:50:41.050
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

01:50:41.593 --> 01:50:44.887
-Merry Christmas.
-Hey, how you doing?

01:50:45.055 --> 01:50:48.057
-You're looking real good, Mr. Rhyme.
-Mr. Rhyme?

01:50:48.267 --> 01:50:51.060
It's Lincoln to you.
Loosen your shorts.

01:50:54.398 --> 01:50:56.316
Oh, my goodness.

01:50:56.692 --> 01:50:59.694
Oh, my goodness.
What are you doing here?

01:51:00.154 --> 01:51:02.822
-Merry Christmas, Uncle Linc.
-Give me a kiss.

01:51:03.032 --> 01:51:05.491
Merry Christmas, Kimmy.
How are you?

01:51:05.743 --> 01:51:06.784
How you doing, Tony?

01:51:07.036 --> 01:51:09.370
I didn't know you'd make this trip.

01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:11.497
Wouldn't be a surprise if you knew.

01:51:11.707 --> 01:51:15.335
I'm sorry. Amelia, this is
my sister, Janine. Her family.

01:51:15.586 --> 01:51:17.170
Yeah, l know. Hi.

01:51:17.421 --> 01:51:19.881
-You know?
-We've met.

01:51:20.382 --> 01:51:22.800
On the phone. How you doing?

01:51:25.888 --> 01:51:27.805
Merry Christmas, Lincoln.
