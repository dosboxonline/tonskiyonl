WEBVTT

00:09.968 --> 00:15.014
(theme music playing)

02:29.816 --> 02:32.569
If you're a leader,
you lead the way.

02:32.652 --> 02:36.406
Not just, uh,
on the easy ones.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.366
You take
the tough ones, too.

02:38.449 --> 02:41.119
A good leader
has to understand

02:41.202 --> 02:44.414
the people that are,
that are under him,

02:44.497 --> 02:45.957
understand their needs,

02:46.040 --> 02:50.211
their desires
or how they think
a little bit.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.505
It seemed like he always
made the right decisions

02:52.589 --> 02:53.756
along the way.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.759
He was a real soldier.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.762
Like some of
the officers, uh,

02:59.846 --> 03:03.600
I don't think
I'd follow them into water,

03:03.683 --> 03:08.313
but, he was,
he was one of the best.

03:08.396 --> 03:11.316
He went right in there
and he didn't, uh,

03:11.399 --> 03:15.069
he never
thought of not being first,

03:15.153 --> 03:19.115
or sending somebody
in his place.

03:19.198 --> 03:22.368
I don't know
how he survived...

03:26.289 --> 03:29.167
but he did.

03:46.559 --> 03:50.104
(panting)

04:13.586 --> 04:14.963
(gunshot)

04:33.314 --> 04:34.899
Lew?

04:34.983 --> 04:36.317
Wake up.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.611
They want us
back at regiment.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.407
C'mon, Nix,
get up.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.617
Let's go.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.121
C'mon, something's up,
Strayer's orders.

04:48.204 --> 04:49.789
Okay, go ahead,
I'll be right down.

04:49.872 --> 04:51.290
Let's go, c'mon,
you got 10 minutes.

04:51.374 --> 04:52.458
Go away.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.460
C'mon, c'mon big guy,
let's go.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.379
Ah, leave me alone.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.505
Okay.

04:59.465 --> 05:00.383
C'mon.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.552
Goddammit.

05:02.635 --> 05:06.723
Oh, that's my own piss,
for Christ's sake.

05:10.435 --> 05:14.313
Sonofabitch.

05:10.435 --> 05:14.313
(chuckles)

05:14.397 --> 05:15.940
I mean, we're the only
unit in the group

05:16.024 --> 05:19.736
that's got the Germans
on the German side
of the Rhine.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.530
If we'd have taken Antwerp,

05:22.613 --> 05:24.323
and I'm not saying that
that would have been easy,

05:24.407 --> 05:26.117
we would be over the river,
well supplied,

05:26.200 --> 05:27.577
and have the Krauts
on their heels.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.038
Now, if I can just
get Ike on the phone.

05:30.121 --> 05:32.248
Are you
listening to me?

05:32.331 --> 05:35.168
Hangin' on every word.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.714
Hey, Moose,
you too?

05:39.797 --> 05:41.841
Yeah, whatever's goin' on,
Sink is not happy.

05:41.924 --> 05:44.052
Nixon, Heyliger.

05:44.135 --> 05:46.512
Meet Colonel Dobie
of British 1st Airborne.

05:46.596 --> 05:49.057
Captain Nixon
is our 2nd Battalion S-2.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.600
That's
1st Lieutenant
Moose Heyliger.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.269
Pleasure.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.269
It appears the British
lost 8,000 men

05:53.352 --> 05:54.687
when Market Garden
fell on its ass,

05:54.771 --> 05:56.898
which is why
Colonel Dobie has been tasked

05:56.981 --> 05:58.858
with coordinating
some kind of rescue operation

05:58.941 --> 06:01.235
for the Red Devils
who were trapped
when Arnhem fell.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.905
Dutch Resistance are harboring
140 of my chaps here,

06:03.988 --> 06:06.783
just outside a Jerry-held town
15 miles north of the river.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.493
They'll make their way
to the riverbank

06:08.576 --> 06:09.911
and assemble in the woods
here, tonight.

06:09.994 --> 06:11.245
Strayer:
Pick a team
from Easy Company

06:11.329 --> 06:13.372
and get them back
across the Rhine
as fast as possible.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.582
Heyliger:
140 men?

06:14.665 --> 06:16.334
Dobie:
Canadian engineers
have supplied six boats.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.795
The rendezvous point
is isolated and landable.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.130
I swam it
myself last night.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.799
At approximately
0030 hours

06:22.882 --> 06:25.802
they will signal
the "V" for victory
with a hand-held red torch.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.387
That would be
a hand-held red flashlight.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.306
All right,
we'll call this thing
Operation Pegasus.

06:30.389 --> 06:32.016
Bob, your 2nd Battalion
is on the spot.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.142
Get it done.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.185
Captain Nixon,

06:34.268 --> 06:35.645
assist Colonel Dobie
in every way possible.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.814
If you need anything at all,
you come to me.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.023
I can hardly
ask for more.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.274
Sir.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.274
Captain Winters?

06:40.358 --> 06:41.609
I haven't seen
your endorsement

06:41.692 --> 06:43.444
on the Market Garden
after action report,

06:43.528 --> 06:46.155
or the updated battalion
TO and E, why is that?

06:46.239 --> 06:47.865
I'll have them at CP
1300, sir.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.784
And I want an inventory
on whatever material

06:49.867 --> 06:51.327
the British 43rd
left behind,

06:51.410 --> 06:53.621
Rations,
medical supplies, transport.

06:53.704 --> 06:55.081
An inventory,
yes, sir.

06:55.164 --> 06:56.499
Dick.

06:55.164 --> 06:56.499
Sir.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.918
I'm still waiting
to write citations
on that 5 October operation.

06:59.001 --> 07:01.212
-I need your report.
-The report, yes, sir.

07:01.295 --> 07:02.630
Light a fire
under it, Dick.

07:02.713 --> 07:03.631
Sir.

07:03.714 --> 07:05.883
Now, goddammit,
we asked for this yesterday,

07:05.967 --> 07:08.386
and here it is today,
a day late and a dollar short.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.429
Enemy disposition
and maps in the S-2.

07:10.513 --> 07:11.931
We should
have a look at that.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.850
And you say there's
about a hundred of 'em?

07:28.739 --> 07:29.949
Hashey:
This is it, boys.

07:30.032 --> 07:31.742
Man:
Why don't the Krauts
just take us off?

07:31.826 --> 07:33.202
Hashey:
They'd have
to get across the river,

07:33.286 --> 07:34.954
across the field
and over the dike.

07:35.037 --> 07:36.706
That's a lot
of territory to cover.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.207
Hashey:
Where d'you want us
to go?

07:38.291 --> 07:40.376
You, Hashey?
You get the penthouse.

07:40.459 --> 07:42.545
Thank you.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.255
We're up top.

07:44.338 --> 07:45.840
How bad does it get?

07:45.923 --> 07:47.216
You'll find out.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.260
Well, that's a lot
of territory to cover.

07:49.343 --> 07:51.137
A couple of regular
GI Joes, huh?

07:51.220 --> 07:52.263
You said it.

07:52.346 --> 07:53.681
C'mon.

07:55.308 --> 08:00.563
New guys
giving the replacements
the what for and why is.

08:00.646 --> 08:03.065
I swear one of them
has never shaved.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.692
Yeah... kids.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.611
This is a hell
of a dog, Tab.

08:06.694 --> 08:08.196
Thank you,
there you go.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.989
What'd you call it, Tab?

08:10.072 --> 08:11.365
Trigger.

08:11.449 --> 08:15.161
That's good,
I like that. Trigger.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.038
Got anything on this?

08:17.121 --> 08:18.706
No, it's all quiet.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.208
More:
We've got penetration!

08:20.291 --> 08:21.709
Liebgott:
Alley's hurt,
we need the doc.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.169
Talbert:
All right,
get him on the table.

08:23.252 --> 08:24.962
Talbert:
Yeah, it's Alley.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.505
All right,
I got this.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.965
Easy.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.965
Alley,
you're gonna be okay.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.884
Winters:
C'mon.
Boyle, get Doc Roe.

08:29.967 --> 08:30.927
Where am I?

08:31.010 --> 08:32.929
Something, something happened,
what happened?

08:33.012 --> 08:33.930
Where was it?

08:34.013 --> 08:35.765
Crossroads, where the road
crosses the dike.

08:35.848 --> 08:36.933
If it wasn't
for your loud mouth,

08:37.016 --> 08:38.142
they'd have never known
we was here.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.435
Hey, you know what,
Joe, back off.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.312
Lesniewski, send a runner
for Lieutenant Welsh.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.438
Lieutenant,
assemble me a squad.

08:42.521 --> 08:43.856
Yes, sir, first squad,
on your feet!

08:43.940 --> 08:45.441
Weapons
and ammo only!

08:45.524 --> 08:46.442
Give me room.

08:46.525 --> 08:48.402
Let's move!
Let's go, let's go!

08:48.486 --> 08:51.239
Boyle, get the boots off,
elevate the leg.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.366
Liebgott,
use the sulphur.

08:53.449 --> 08:55.493
All right, let's get this done
quickly, we gotta move,

08:55.576 --> 08:56.577
not too much.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.079
Hey, Alley.
All right.

09:34.198 --> 09:36.951
(gunshots)

09:39.662 --> 09:40.705
MG42?

09:40.788 --> 09:41.706
Yeah.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.457
What the hell
are they shootin' at?

09:43.541 --> 09:45.293
What's down
that road?

09:45.376 --> 09:46.919
Regimental headquarters.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.796
But that's
three miles away.

09:48.879 --> 09:50.548
Why are they giving away
their position?

09:50.631 --> 09:52.341
They ain't as smart
as me and you?

09:52.425 --> 09:53.718
(gunshots)

09:53.801 --> 09:55.386
I think I'll
check it out anyway.

09:55.469 --> 09:58.139
Hold here,
wait for my signal.

09:58.222 --> 09:59.598
Yes, sir.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.773
Holding here.
I'm waitin' for a signal.

10:09.650 --> 10:12.194
(gunshots)

10:26.584 --> 10:29.086
(gunshots)

10:53.194 --> 10:55.029
(gunshots)

11:30.564 --> 11:32.733
(gunshots)

11:35.528 --> 11:38.239
This is our
fallback position, here.

11:38.322 --> 11:39.657
Mortars, deploy here.

11:39.740 --> 11:42.284
First squad, on me.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.203
Go.

12:05.766 --> 12:08.561
(distant shouting)

12:14.650 --> 12:16.235
(typewriter bell dings)

12:25.035 --> 12:27.371
(German chatter)

12:30.332 --> 12:34.795
(gunshots)

12:50.853 --> 12:53.647
Second on the right.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.275
First on the right.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.279
Third on the right.

13:00.362 --> 13:01.989
Nail the machine gun.

13:02.072 --> 13:03.032
Second on the left.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.700
First on the left.

13:04.783 --> 13:06.785
Wait for my signal.

13:07.786 --> 13:09.205
Prepare to fire.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.874
Two rounds.
AG quick.

13:11.957 --> 13:15.419
(German chatter continues)

13:17.630 --> 13:19.381
(gunshots)

13:28.766 --> 13:30.184
(gunshots)

13:36.774 --> 13:40.778
(rapid gunfire)

13:40.861 --> 13:45.199
(Germans shouting)

13:45.282 --> 13:46.283
Fall back!

13:46.367 --> 13:47.576
Fire.

13:51.539 --> 13:54.542
(rapid gunfire)

13:57.670 --> 13:59.380
Fire.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.058
Higgins!

14:11.141 --> 14:14.103
Handful of Krauts,
based on the dike, 12:00!

14:16.564 --> 14:17.940
How many Krauts
are left up there?

14:18.023 --> 14:19.525
I don't know.

14:19.608 --> 14:21.902
But we got
seven in one blow.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.865
Bring on Boyle
and Perconte, go!

14:28.659 --> 14:30.244
C'mon, fall back.

14:30.327 --> 14:32.746
Suppressing fire.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.082
Suppressing fire!

14:35.165 --> 14:38.043
Hashey, Garcia,
follow me.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.174
Harry, tell Peacock
to bring up the balance
of 1st Platoon

14:44.258 --> 14:45.884
on the double!

14:45.968 --> 14:48.470
And another
machine gun squad, over.

14:48.554 --> 14:51.223
Dukeman!

14:51.307 --> 14:54.310
Go get that machine gun
on the right flank, go!

14:54.393 --> 14:55.894
Christenson!

14:56.895 --> 14:58.731
Fuck, Dukeman's down.

15:16.040 --> 15:19.627
Sir, the balance
of 1st Platoon are here.

15:19.710 --> 15:23.213
Gordon and More
brought another .30 cal.

15:25.674 --> 15:27.760
Sir.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.848
They're behind
a solid roadway embankment.

15:32.931 --> 15:34.224
We're in a ditch.

15:34.308 --> 15:35.684
They can outflank us
along the dike

15:35.768 --> 15:38.520
and catch us
out here as soon as
they figure that out.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.983
So, how many Krauts
are we talking about?

15:43.067 --> 15:44.652
Well, there's
a ferry crossing here,

15:44.735 --> 15:48.030
So, it could be
a whole battalion,
as far as I know.

15:49.531 --> 15:52.785
Okay.
What are your orders?

15:56.789 --> 15:59.041
We got no choice.

16:02.920 --> 16:03.837
Here it is.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.256
Talbert, you'll take
10 men along the dike.

16:06.340 --> 16:09.009
Peacock, you'll take 10 men
along the left flank.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.387
I'll take 10 up the middle,
so follow me.

16:11.470 --> 16:12.721
Questions?

16:12.805 --> 16:14.556
Go!

16:16.058 --> 16:18.143
(knocking)

16:18.227 --> 16:19.436
Enter.

16:44.086 --> 16:47.089
I don't know why
I'm still doing this.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.173
What, drinking?

16:48.257 --> 16:51.093
No, hiding it
in your footlocker.

16:51.176 --> 16:54.555
I'm a captain,
for Christ's sake.

16:54.638 --> 16:56.432
Well, why don't you...

16:56.515 --> 16:58.934
why don't you
just give it up?

16:59.017 --> 17:01.437
Drinking?

17:01.520 --> 17:04.940
No, hiding it
in my footlocker.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.526
You're a captain,
for Pete's sake.

17:10.904 --> 17:12.072
Maybe you're right,

17:12.156 --> 17:14.074
Maybe
this is the perfect place
to stop drinking.

17:14.158 --> 17:17.411
Right here on the business end
of the Allied advance.

17:19.413 --> 17:20.497
Cheers.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.268
Dick, you know,
that's not literature.

17:41.351 --> 17:42.811
You just keep it simple.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.606
Try writing it
in the first person plural,
you know.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.608
Say "we" a lot.

17:47.691 --> 17:48.776
Thanks for the tip.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.909

20:03.827 --> 20:05.454
Holy shit!

20:08.248 --> 20:10.751
It's a whole other company!

What's he saying?

20:52.542 --> 20:53.919
He's telling me
that they're Polish.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.837
Polish,
don't you believe it.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.839
There ain't no Poles
in the SS!

20:57.923 --> 20:59.341

where you can spot the fall
of those rounds, go!

21:25.075 --> 21:26.118
Right, sir.

21:31.331 --> 21:33.333
Incoming rogues!

21:33.417 --> 21:35.627
Easy Company,
take cover!

21:37.295 --> 21:38.505
Boyle's hit!

21:38.588 --> 21:40.632
Jesus Christ,
they got me.

21:40.716 --> 21:44.344
Take cover,
it's German artillery.

21:45.804 --> 21:48.849
Get Boyle, he's down.
C'mon, help me.

22:18.336 --> 22:21.423
Jesus, Captain,
they're SS.

22:32.976 --> 22:34.186
Joe?

22:34.269 --> 22:36.104
Joe, knock it off.

22:36.188 --> 22:39.232
Goddammit, what?

22:39.316 --> 22:40.817
You're bleeding.

22:40.901 --> 22:43.278
-Ah, it's nothing, Cap'n.
-I want you to take
these prisoners back

22:43.361 --> 22:44.279
to Battalion CP.

22:44.362 --> 22:45.739
Get yourself cleaned up.

22:45.822 --> 22:46.907
Yes, sir.

22:46.990 --> 22:48.241
C'mon, Kraut boys.

22:48.325 --> 22:49.326
Joe?

22:49.409 --> 22:50.368
Yeah.

22:50.452 --> 22:51.661
Drop your ammo.

22:50.452 --> 22:51.661
What?

22:51.745 --> 22:53.080
Drop your ammo.

22:53.163 --> 22:54.623
Are you kidding me,
what are you doing?

22:54.706 --> 22:55.874
Give me your weapon.

22:55.957 --> 22:57.084
Cap'n.

22:59.294 --> 23:01.296
You have one round.

23:01.379 --> 23:03.548
Johnny, how many prisoners
do we have?

23:03.632 --> 23:05.550
We got 11 right now, sir.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.052
Okay.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.387
You drop a prisoner,
the rest'll jump you.

23:09.471 --> 23:13.850
I want all prisoners back
at Battalion CP, alive.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.477
Yes, sir.

23:22.234 --> 23:25.278
"They got me."
You believe that?

23:25.362 --> 23:28.115
You believe I said that?

23:28.198 --> 23:29.449
Can you make it
back to CP?

23:29.533 --> 23:32.202
Yeah.

23:32.285 --> 23:33.286
All right.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.831
I will see you
someplace else.

23:36.957 --> 23:40.585
Take these to Battalion.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.587
And split 'em up.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.587
Yes, sir.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.678
And... hup.

23:49.761 --> 23:55.559
All right.
Here you are.

23:55.642 --> 23:57.894
We had 'em on the run.

23:57.978 --> 24:00.313
-How's that?
-The Germans
were flooding back

24:00.397 --> 24:01.398
towards the ferry crossing

24:01.481 --> 24:03.316
when we hit 'em
with artillery.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.026
It was like
a turkey shoot.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.903
Then they hit us
with their 88s,

24:06.987 --> 24:09.364
zeroed in
on this crossroad.

24:09.447 --> 24:10.657
Now we were lucky,
though.

24:10.740 --> 24:13.201
Only 22 wounded.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.828
Lucky?

24:14.911 --> 24:16.079
Captain Winters?

24:16.163 --> 24:17.414
He's right down there, sir.

24:17.497 --> 24:19.124
All right, carry on.

24:24.629 --> 24:27.799
Paratrooper:
All right, Krauts,
<i>hande hoch.</i>

25:04.336 --> 25:06.338
22 wounded, huh?

25:06.421 --> 25:07.631
You okay?

25:07.714 --> 25:09.382
Yeah. One killed.

25:09.466 --> 25:10.425
Who?

25:10.508 --> 25:12.010
Dukeman.

25:13.887 --> 25:16.097
Dukeman.

25:19.017 --> 25:22.938
Well, you're looking
at two full companies
of SS out there.

25:23.021 --> 25:26.358
About 50 dead, probably
another hundred wounded.

25:26.441 --> 25:28.235
Seven back
in the regimental cage

25:28.318 --> 25:30.362
plus a whole string
of 'em up there.

25:31.655 --> 25:35.075
That's not bad
for Dukeman.

25:35.158 --> 25:37.577
You got a drink?

25:37.661 --> 25:39.871
Of water?

25:44.167 --> 25:46.419
Yeah, it's water.

25:55.553 --> 25:56.596
Thanks.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.142
Okay?

26:14.656 --> 26:17.117
<i>Sink:</i>
<i>363rd Volksgrenadier</i>
<i>hit Opheusden</i>

26:17.200 --> 26:19.995
early this morning,
about the same time
your SS made a run

26:20.078 --> 26:22.122
for my CP
down the road.

26:22.205 --> 26:24.958
3rd Battalion got
the hell beat out of 'em.

26:25.041 --> 26:27.961
Holly Horton was killed.

26:28.044 --> 26:30.255
Major Horton's dead?

26:30.338 --> 26:33.174
They hit 2nd Battalion CP
in force.

26:33.258 --> 26:36.636
He was organizing
the defense.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.431
Captain Nixon,
excuse us for just a minute.

26:54.237 --> 26:57.324
How'd you feel about
handling a battalion?

26:57.407 --> 26:58.908
Sir?

26:58.992 --> 27:01.995
I'm moving you up
to Executive Officer
of 2nd Battalion.

27:02.078 --> 27:04.372
Colonel Strayer is...

27:04.456 --> 27:07.042
well, he could use
some help.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.794
Well, I know I could
handle them in the field, sir.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.129
That's right, Dick.

27:11.212 --> 27:13.340
You're a solid tactician
and a good leader.

27:13.423 --> 27:15.925
Don't worry
about administration.

27:24.100 --> 27:27.020
Who do you think'll be
taking over Easy, sir?

27:27.103 --> 27:30.357
Moose Heyliger
can command Easy Company.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.276
-Lieutenant Heyliger
would be my choice, sir.
-Good.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.529
You pack your gear
and c'mon up to Battalion CP.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.529
Yes, sir.

27:41.034 --> 27:44.162
Would you like
some coffee, sir?

27:44.245 --> 27:46.623
Yeah. Thanks, Doc.

27:46.706 --> 27:48.708
All right.

27:48.792 --> 27:51.002
Hey, Dick!

27:51.086 --> 27:53.338
Finish your novel yet?

27:53.421 --> 27:54.756
That's a lot of homework.

27:54.839 --> 27:57.592
And I thought
Executive Officer
was supposed to be a fun job.

27:57.675 --> 27:58.635
Who are you?

27:58.718 --> 28:00.428
Zielinski, sir.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.930
Who is he?

28:02.013 --> 28:05.266
Zielinski's
my orderly.

28:05.350 --> 28:06.518
(whistling)

28:06.601 --> 28:08.311
Well, rank does
have its privileges.

28:08.395 --> 28:09.938
Orderly, huh?

28:10.021 --> 28:11.898
I suppose you do stuff
like get coffee?

28:11.981 --> 28:13.149
Can do, sir.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.026
Black, no sugar.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.069
And a bacon sandwich.

28:16.152 --> 28:17.153
What, you want something?

28:17.237 --> 28:18.822
Bacon sandwich.

28:18.905 --> 28:23.410
You can give that
to Colonel Sink.
With my compliments.

28:23.493 --> 28:26.079
All that
for two pages, huh?

28:26.162 --> 28:28.415
Guess that means
that's gonna take a while.

28:28.498 --> 28:30.041
Yeah, it is.
You want a job?

28:30.125 --> 28:32.961
(chuckles)
There it is.

28:33.044 --> 28:34.963
I think somebody wishes
he were back in charge

28:35.046 --> 28:36.214
of Easy Company, Moose.

28:36.297 --> 28:38.466
Are you two
just here to gloat?

28:38.550 --> 28:40.176
No, just rub it in
a little bit.

28:40.260 --> 28:42.804
Moose is gonna
lead his first mission
as company commander.

28:42.887 --> 28:44.806
Operation Pegasus
is set to go off.

28:44.889 --> 28:46.307
I thought I might
give you the heads up.

28:46.391 --> 28:51.312
Pegasus, yeah.
Yeah, great.

28:51.396 --> 28:52.856
Everybody know their job?

28:52.939 --> 28:54.274
We've drilled
with the boats all day.

28:54.357 --> 28:55.650
Lieutenant Welsh
is coming along,

28:55.733 --> 28:57.277
and the Canadian engineers.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.112
Colonel Dobie
knows his stuff.

28:59.195 --> 29:00.947
Know how many times
you wanna cross the river?

29:01.030 --> 29:03.616
If there really are 140 Brits
in hiding over there,

29:03.700 --> 29:04.701
three trips.

29:04.784 --> 29:07.120
Speed is the key.
What time's jump-off?

29:07.203 --> 29:09.998
We'll be at the far side
of the Rhine at 0100.

29:10.081 --> 29:11.124
Speed is the key.

29:11.207 --> 29:12.542
Keep moving
and lead the way.

29:12.625 --> 29:14.002
Dick.

29:14.085 --> 29:15.587
Easy's in good hands.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.923
Yeah.

29:19.007 --> 29:21.843
Yeah, right.
Well, hang tough.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.428
I could say
the same to you.

29:23.511 --> 29:26.431
Yeah.
Good luck, Moose.

29:26.514 --> 29:28.141
Captain.

29:29.476 --> 29:30.768
Ah, Nix?

29:30.852 --> 29:31.728
Yeah.

29:31.811 --> 29:33.771
Are we sure on
the intelligence of this?

29:33.855 --> 29:35.315
Well, I think
it's pretty good.

29:35.398 --> 29:37.775
Is Easy walking into
another company of Germans

29:37.859 --> 29:39.444
no one can see?

29:39.527 --> 29:42.822
Why don't we ask Moose
when he gets back?

29:42.906 --> 29:45.575
Right, yeah.

29:45.658 --> 29:47.660
Oh, if, ah, they do
run into any trouble,

29:47.744 --> 29:49.829
you'll let me know?

29:49.913 --> 29:51.581
Yeah.

29:51.664 --> 29:55.251
You run into
any bacon sandwich,
do the same, all right?

29:57.337 --> 29:58.922
Yeah.

30:28.618 --> 30:29.994
Private:
Line secure, sir.

30:30.078 --> 30:32.205
Fall back
into position, Private.

30:30.078 --> 30:32.205
Yes, sir.

30:32.288 --> 30:34.040
I got the .30 cal
on the left flank.

30:34.123 --> 30:36.543
Extend it out
to the left, 10 yards.

30:36.626 --> 30:39.337
So, Colonel,
where are they?

30:41.464 --> 30:42.715
Leicester.

30:41.464 --> 30:42.715
<i>Square.</i>

30:42.799 --> 30:45.134
Come on in.

30:45.218 --> 30:46.761
Welcome back, sir.

30:46.844 --> 30:47.887
Good to be back.

30:47.971 --> 30:50.515
Heyliger,
506 of the 101st Airborne.

30:50.598 --> 30:53.393
Never thought I'd be so glad
to see a bloody Yank.

30:53.476 --> 30:55.353
Your show, Colonel.

30:55.436 --> 30:56.729
I'll be back shortly.

30:56.813 --> 30:57.855
Go.

31:00.483 --> 31:01.818
Boats are all
secure, sir.

31:01.901 --> 31:03.027
Bull.

31:04.821 --> 31:08.366
The Brits are on the way,
pass the word.

31:11.077 --> 31:14.080
Sir, you missed
a signature... here.

31:23.590 --> 31:25.049
Moose Heyliger?

31:25.133 --> 31:26.134
That's me, sir.

31:26.217 --> 31:27.969
God bless you, my man.

31:28.052 --> 31:30.305
We're ready to go, sir.
Where's the rest of you?

31:30.388 --> 31:31.681
Right.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.896
And here we all are.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.690
Well, let's go.

31:42.609 --> 31:44.736
Wahai, Mohammed!

31:44.819 --> 31:46.863
(together)
Wahai, Mohammed!

31:46.946 --> 31:49.741
Moose Heyliger
and the American 101st

31:49.824 --> 31:52.702
have done the Red Devils
a great service,

31:52.785 --> 31:55.163
making it possible
for us to return,

31:55.246 --> 31:57.874
and fight the enemy
on another day.

31:59.375 --> 32:00.668
To Easy Company...

32:00.752 --> 32:03.421
victory... and Currahee.

32:03.504 --> 32:06.966
All:
Currahee!

32:14.849 --> 32:17.143
Winters:
I was only Easy's CO
for four months, Moose.

32:17.226 --> 32:19.646
Before that
it was Meehan's company,

32:19.729 --> 32:20.938
before that Sobel's.

32:21.022 --> 32:22.815
Heyliger:
Yeah, but you're
the only combat commander

32:22.899 --> 32:23.983
they've ever known,

32:24.067 --> 32:24.984
and I'm from
another company.

32:25.068 --> 32:26.611
Winters:
You know where
they came from,

32:26.694 --> 32:28.863
you know what
they've been through.

32:28.946 --> 32:30.114
Just hang tough.

32:30.198 --> 32:34.243
Train
your new platoon leaders,
and trust your noncoms.

32:34.327 --> 32:35.370
Man:
Halt!

32:35.453 --> 32:36.996
It's Moose.

32:35.453 --> 32:36.996
(gunfire)

32:37.080 --> 32:38.998
Hold your fire!

32:41.793 --> 32:44.170
Okay, buddy.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.840
Oh, my god.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.928
Send for
Lieutenant Welsh.

32:52.011 --> 32:54.347
Stay awake on me,
stay awake on me, Moose.

32:54.430 --> 32:55.390
Here, look in my eyes.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.225
Send for
Lieutenant Welsh, now!

32:57.308 --> 32:59.936
Okay, okay.

33:00.019 --> 33:01.729
I'm sorry, sir,
I'm so sorry.

33:01.813 --> 33:04.190
I didn't know.
Jesus Christ.

33:04.273 --> 33:05.566
Where
are you from, trooper?

33:05.650 --> 33:06.693
Wyoming, sir.

33:06.776 --> 33:09.028
Well, you're a long way
from home, Private.

33:09.112 --> 33:10.655
-Stretcher!
-I got him, Harry.

33:10.738 --> 33:11.698
-You give him morphine?
-Yeah.

33:11.781 --> 33:12.865
How much?

33:12.949 --> 33:15.034
Oh, I can't remember,
two, three syrettes maybe.

33:15.118 --> 33:16.661
-Three syrettes maybe?
-Yeah.

33:16.744 --> 33:18.830
-Jesus Christ, were you
trying to kill him?
-I think it was two.

33:18.913 --> 33:21.332
You don't think it might
be important to let me know
how much medication

33:21.416 --> 33:22.709
the man has had, huh?
'Cause I do not see

33:22.792 --> 33:24.460
one syrette
on the man's jacket.

33:24.544 --> 33:25.503
I'm sorry, Doc.

33:25.586 --> 33:26.921
Sure is a good thing
he a big man.

33:27.004 --> 33:28.256
Maybe he
stand a chance.

33:28.339 --> 33:30.091
He was in a lot of pain, Doc,
we didn't know what to do.

33:30.174 --> 33:32.593
Yeah, well, you oughta.
You know, you are officers,
you are grownups,

33:32.677 --> 33:34.095
you oughta know.

33:34.178 --> 33:36.889
All right, let's go,
c'mon, move it!

33:44.689 --> 33:47.191
Paratrooper:
Mama, mama, can't you see?

33:47.275 --> 33:49.068
All:
Mama, mama,
can't you see?

33:49.152 --> 33:51.404
Paratrooper:
What the Airborne's
done to me.

33:51.487 --> 33:53.364
All:
What the Airborne's
done to me.

33:53.448 --> 33:54.449
Once more.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.576
Paratrooper:
About face.

33:56.659 --> 33:59.162
Forward march.

33:59.245 --> 34:02.206
<i>Winters:</i>
<i>Easy still has only</i>
<i>65% strength,</i>

34:02.290 --> 34:04.083
<i>and most of those</i>
<i>are replacements,</i>

34:04.167 --> 34:06.461
<i>including</i>
<i>their new CO.</i>

34:06.544 --> 34:08.045
<i>Nixon:</i>
<i>How's Lieutenant Dike doing?</i>

34:08.129 --> 34:09.130
Three weeks in Holland,

34:09.213 --> 34:11.382
the guys are already
calling him Foxhole Norman.

34:11.466 --> 34:14.469
Well, they're talking
about a mid-March action
at the earliest,

34:14.552 --> 34:16.679
so, we train the guys
for three months,

34:16.763 --> 34:18.306
we jump into Berlin,
we end the war.

34:18.389 --> 34:21.309
The only thing
holding together
Easy Company is the NCOs,

34:21.392 --> 34:22.685
Toccoa men.

34:22.769 --> 34:25.646
Sir, there's
a Sergeant Guarnere
here to see you.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.148
Look what
the train brought in.

34:27.231 --> 34:28.691
Hey, the daredevil.

34:28.775 --> 34:29.817
Hiya, Captain.

34:29.901 --> 34:30.860
Welcome back, Bill.

34:30.943 --> 34:32.028
Jesus, it's true.

34:32.111 --> 34:33.696
I never thought I'd see you
behind a desk, sir.

34:33.780 --> 34:35.531
Yeah, and someday
he'll sit behind it.

34:35.615 --> 34:36.699
Well, I just went AWOL

34:36.783 --> 34:38.701
from the hospital
to get back here, sir.

34:38.785 --> 34:40.369
I hope that's not gonna
cause you a problem.

34:40.453 --> 34:41.496
Would you care
if it did?

34:41.579 --> 34:43.790
Not a bit, sir.

34:45.041 --> 34:48.169
Got a letter for you
here from Moose.

34:48.252 --> 34:49.962
Lieutenant Heyliger, sir.

34:50.046 --> 34:53.341
He's recovering,
but it's gonna be a long haul.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.760
Thanks, Bill.

34:55.843 --> 34:58.179
So, I hear there's, uh,
there's gonna be
a football game,

34:58.262 --> 35:00.056
those chumps from
the 5-0 deuce,
is that right?

35:00.139 --> 35:02.099
Oh, yeah,
Christmas Day.

35:02.183 --> 35:04.018
Great,
Sky Train boys.

35:04.101 --> 35:06.896
Can't wait.

35:09.732 --> 35:11.359
Great.

35:14.278 --> 35:16.239
Well, uh...

35:16.322 --> 35:18.574
I'll just go
find some trouble.

35:18.658 --> 35:21.160
You do that.

35:21.244 --> 35:22.328
Hey, Bill.

35:22.411 --> 35:23.704
Yes, sir?

35:23.788 --> 35:26.958
No more
joyriding, right?

35:27.041 --> 35:30.628
Oh, ah,
anybody ever heard

35:30.711 --> 35:34.674
of a little joint
called Lulu's?

35:34.757 --> 35:36.717
You got me.

35:36.801 --> 35:39.720
I'll just ask around.

35:47.144 --> 35:50.481
Well, I guess now's
as good a time as any.

35:50.565 --> 35:51.816
What's that,
a piece of paper?

35:51.899 --> 35:53.276
I don't wanna see
another piece of paper.

35:53.359 --> 35:55.152
General Taylor
has flown back to Washington.

35:55.236 --> 35:57.530
He's left General McAuliffe
in charge of the division.

35:57.613 --> 36:00.283
Colonel Sink is in Rheims
to see Marlene Dietrich.

36:00.366 --> 36:02.201
Marlene Dietrich
is in Rheims?

36:02.285 --> 36:03.244
At the USO.

36:03.327 --> 36:04.620
I'm outta here.
I'm going to Rheims.

36:04.704 --> 36:06.706
Strayer will be in London
for at least another week

36:06.789 --> 36:08.416
for Lieutenant Colonel
Dobie's wedding.

36:08.499 --> 36:11.252
I personally am heading back
to Aldbourne to look up
a certain young lady.

36:11.335 --> 36:13.254
What are you
telling me?

36:13.337 --> 36:15.131
You, my friend,
are headed to Paris.

36:15.214 --> 36:16.132
City of Light.

36:16.215 --> 36:17.550
That's a 48-hour pass.

36:17.633 --> 36:21.429
It's been decided
that you need a little dose
of civilization.

36:21.512 --> 36:24.640
Bon voyage.

36:27.602 --> 36:30.229
I second that.

36:35.234 --> 36:40.114
(French chatter)

37:00.968 --> 37:02.678
Man:
No, the Airborne's
right up there.

37:02.762 --> 37:05.222
The Airborne is
as tough as they come.

37:05.306 --> 37:07.433
...basic training.

37:07.516 --> 37:08.809
That's basic,
basic training.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.103
You know what I did
in basic training?

37:11.187 --> 37:12.688
I had to eat rats.

37:12.772 --> 37:14.148
In basic training.

37:14.231 --> 37:16.400
Well, that's
the first time...

39:03.507 --> 39:05.760
<i>Monsieur?</i>

39:05.843 --> 39:07.720
<i>Monsieur,</i>
<i>c'est la terminus...</i>

39:07.803 --> 39:09.472
(speaking French)

39:56.894 --> 40:00.272
(indistinct chatter)

41:00.916 --> 41:03.335
<i>Every time I look at you,</i>
<i>I see eight or nine of you.</i>

41:03.419 --> 41:05.087
I'll be all right
when I can only see one.

41:05.171 --> 41:06.755
Look at me,
I'm John Wayne.

41:06.839 --> 41:09.508
The costume department
set me up

41:09.592 --> 41:11.385
with these great
Navy whites.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.469
Luz, shut up.

41:12.553 --> 41:13.512
What do you think?

41:13.596 --> 41:14.597
I'm trying to
watch this.

41:14.680 --> 41:15.973
I've seen this movie
13 times, okay?

41:16.056 --> 41:18.058
Well, I haven't,
so, shut up.

41:18.142 --> 41:19.393
Watch the movie,
it's fine.

41:19.476 --> 41:20.519
Hey, Skip.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.521
Shh, c'mon.

41:22.605 --> 41:24.899
Where've you been?
I've been lookin'
all over for you.

41:24.982 --> 41:26.859
Well, Don, I was
at home in Tonawanda,

41:26.942 --> 41:28.444
but then Hitler
started this whole thing,

41:28.527 --> 41:30.362
so, now I'm here.

41:30.446 --> 41:31.697
How'd you make out
in craps?

41:31.780 --> 41:32.907
Not so bad.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.658
Here's the 60 bucks
I borrowed.

41:34.742 --> 41:35.743
You're paying me back?

41:35.826 --> 41:38.162
And, to say thank you...

41:38.245 --> 41:40.372
-Surprising.
-A tip.

41:40.456 --> 41:41.373
Jesus!

41:41.457 --> 41:42.541
Shut up!

41:42.625 --> 41:45.085
I was up six grand,
but I only have 3,600 left.

41:45.169 --> 41:46.587
What are you gonna do
with all that dough?

41:46.670 --> 41:49.381
-Blow most of it in Paris
as soon as possible.
-Gimme a tip.

41:49.465 --> 41:52.259
I don't think that climate
in there agrees with you.

41:52.343 --> 41:55.512
As a matter of fact,
I've been worried about
your health altogether.

41:55.596 --> 41:57.181
Hey, Buck.

41:57.264 --> 41:58.349
<i>You don't look well.</i>

41:58.432 --> 41:59.934
How are you feeling?

42:00.017 --> 42:03.854
Your wounds heal,
all four of them?

42:04.980 --> 42:07.524
You seen this before?

42:09.401 --> 42:12.029
Buck.

42:12.112 --> 42:14.448
Hi.

42:14.531 --> 42:16.659
Is it any good?

42:16.742 --> 42:20.162
Ah, yeah.

42:20.246 --> 42:21.455
It's a real corker.

42:21.538 --> 42:24.458
<i>I warned you about this girl</i>
<i>a month ago.</i>

42:29.713 --> 42:33.759
<i>Oh, won't anybody</i>
<i>give you a light?</i>

42:33.842 --> 42:35.678
Lip, favorite part.

42:35.761 --> 42:37.554
<i>Well, you took the words</i>
<i>right out of my mouth.</i>

42:37.638 --> 42:39.306
Got a penny?

42:39.390 --> 42:41.600
Got a penny?

42:45.145 --> 42:47.481
Got a... penny?

42:47.564 --> 42:48.899
Got a penny?

42:48.983 --> 42:50.818
What?

42:50.901 --> 42:54.738
Sure,
it's an English penny...

42:55.739 --> 42:56.865
Lights!

42:56.949 --> 42:58.701
C'mon.

42:58.784 --> 42:59.743
Quiet!

42:59.827 --> 43:01.328
You can't
do that to the Duke.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.872
I said, quiet!

43:03.956 --> 43:06.500
Elements of the 1st
and the 6th SS Panzer Division

43:06.583 --> 43:09.044
have broken through
in the Ardennes Forest.

43:09.128 --> 43:10.754
Now, they've overrun
the 28th Infantry

43:10.838 --> 43:12.214
and elements
of the 4th.

43:12.298 --> 43:14.800
All officers
report to respective HQs.

43:14.883 --> 43:16.260
All passes
are canceled.

43:16.343 --> 43:17.594
(groans and chatter)

43:17.678 --> 43:20.097
Enlisted men report
to barracks and your
platoon leaders.

43:28.439 --> 43:30.774
Damn, what a day.

43:28.439 --> 43:30.774
Unbelievable.

43:33.736 --> 43:36.155
Got a light?

44:02.306 --> 44:04.516
Sir?
Lieutenant Peacock, sir.

44:04.600 --> 44:05.893
Have you seen
Colonel Strayer?

44:05.976 --> 44:07.227
Where's
the company commander?

44:07.311 --> 44:09.730
Oh, Lieutenant Dike,
I've been looking for him
all day.

44:09.813 --> 44:11.690
I mean, how is it
that the 4th Army's problem

44:11.774 --> 44:13.317
gets dumped
on the Airborne?

44:13.400 --> 44:15.861
Lieutenant Peacock,
Lieutenant Compton.

44:15.944 --> 44:17.029
Cap'n Winters.

44:17.112 --> 44:18.697
Oh, Lieutenant Dike,
I've been looking for you.

44:18.781 --> 44:19.698
Sir, we have a problem.

44:19.782 --> 44:20.866
Colonel Strayer
has not yet returned

44:20.949 --> 44:22.534
from some wedding
that he's attending in London.

44:22.618 --> 44:24.203
Can you believe that?
We're going to the front.

44:24.286 --> 44:25.371
We're going
to the front here,

44:25.454 --> 44:26.997
and our CO isn't even
in the same damn country.

44:27.081 --> 44:28.540
You have a bigger problem,
Lieutenant Dike.

44:28.624 --> 44:29.875
You have men
returning to action

44:29.958 --> 44:32.378
without proper
cold weather clothing
and not enough ammo.

44:32.461 --> 44:34.922
-Sir?
-I suggest you take a canvass
of the entire base.

44:35.005 --> 44:37.925
Get what materials you have
before you roll out.

44:38.008 --> 44:40.594
-Or have you done
that already?
-No, sir.

44:40.677 --> 44:43.097
K-rations, as many
as you can scrounge.

44:43.180 --> 44:44.765
We don't know
if we'll be resupplied
or not.

44:44.848 --> 44:46.225
-Yes, sir.
-What about ammo?

44:46.308 --> 44:49.144
There is no more ammo.
Distribute it amongst
the men as best you can

44:49.228 --> 44:50.604
so at least everybody
has something.

44:50.687 --> 44:51.772
Yes, sir.

44:51.855 --> 44:53.565
Lieutenant Compton,
Lieutenant Peacock,

44:53.649 --> 44:55.275
inform Lieutenant Shames
of the situation.

44:55.359 --> 44:57.069
Get all your platoons
as best equipped as you can,

44:57.152 --> 44:58.695
and then report back here
to me, understood?

44:58.779 --> 45:00.030
Yes, sir.

45:00.114 --> 45:01.532
Cap'n.

45:25.222 --> 45:27.474
I guess the blackout's
not in effect.

45:27.558 --> 45:29.309
Luftwaffe
must be asleep.

45:29.393 --> 45:33.105
What a difference a day makes,
huh, Lieutenant?

45:34.148 --> 45:36.316
Christ,
I miss those C47s.

45:36.400 --> 45:38.569
We've got
a tailgate jump here.

45:43.824 --> 45:45.117
I just wanna know
where they're sending us,

45:45.200 --> 45:46.785
what the hell
we're supposed to do
with no ammo.

45:46.869 --> 45:49.413
Hey, kid,
what's your name again?

45:49.496 --> 45:51.165
Suerth.

45:51.248 --> 45:52.958
Suerth, uh, Junior.

45:53.041 --> 45:54.376
You got
any ammo, Junior?

45:54.460 --> 45:56.128
Uh, just what
I'm carrying.

45:56.211 --> 45:58.881
What about socks, Junior,
you got extra socks?

45:58.964 --> 45:59.923
A pair.

46:00.007 --> 46:01.884
You need
four, minimum.

46:01.967 --> 46:04.303
Feet, hands,
neck, balls.

46:04.386 --> 46:06.513
All:
Extra socks warms
them all.

46:06.597 --> 46:08.807
Okay, we all
remember that one.

46:08.891 --> 46:10.184
But did we remember
the socks?

46:10.267 --> 46:12.436
Yeah, I'd give
my goddamn boots
for a cigarette.

46:12.519 --> 46:13.562
We're all out
of ammo and socks.

46:13.645 --> 46:15.147
Anybody
got a cigarette?

46:15.230 --> 46:16.857
I bet Junior's got
plenty of both.

46:16.940 --> 46:17.816
I don't.

46:17.900 --> 46:19.193
How about a hat,
you got a hat?

46:19.276 --> 46:20.360
Hey, you got
extra ammo?

46:20.444 --> 46:22.571
What about a coat,
you got a coat?

46:22.654 --> 46:24.281
I need to pee.

46:24.364 --> 46:25.449
How about
some smokes, then?

46:25.532 --> 46:26.492
Yeah, I got some smokes.

46:26.575 --> 46:27.910
Oh, now you're talking.

46:27.993 --> 46:28.952
Hey, hey,
hey, hey.

46:29.036 --> 46:30.996
Hey, hey,
hey, over here.

46:31.079 --> 46:32.039
Pass 'em down.

46:32.122 --> 46:33.957
Somebody
give me a light.

46:34.041 --> 46:35.000
Keep moving, c'mon.

46:35.083 --> 46:37.544
Keep it coming.
Over to the left.

46:39.713 --> 46:41.465
Keep it moving.

46:41.548 --> 46:44.301
All the way down,
keep moving.

46:50.807 --> 46:53.477
Clear the way,
clear the way.

46:58.190 --> 46:59.191
Keep moving, guys.

46:59.274 --> 47:00.692
All right, guys,
15 minutes.

47:00.776 --> 47:03.320
Smoke 'em
if you got 'em.

47:03.403 --> 47:04.530
Keep warm, guys.

47:04.613 --> 47:06.031
Where the hell
are we?

47:06.114 --> 47:09.451
Sure we ain't in hell.
It's too damn cold.

47:13.914 --> 47:14.873
Hey, stand back, guys.

47:14.957 --> 47:17.417
I've been holding this
for the last hour.

47:17.501 --> 47:20.963
Anybody got
any matches?

47:24.049 --> 47:27.261
Oh, that's better.

47:27.344 --> 47:30.222
Gather round guys,
gather round.

47:37.187 --> 47:40.857
Wait right here,
Don't go anywhere.

47:40.941 --> 47:42.985
Welcome to Belgium.

47:43.068 --> 47:45.612
This area's
known as Bastogne.

47:45.696 --> 47:47.322
Strategic crossroads town.

47:47.406 --> 47:50.242
Seven roads leading in,
seven roads leading out,

47:50.325 --> 47:52.411
which makes it ideal
for Kraut armor.

47:52.494 --> 47:55.163
Now, Ike wants
to make sure that the Krauts

47:55.247 --> 47:56.790
can't use those roads,

47:56.873 --> 47:59.710
so we're gonna put
a perimeter around Bastogne,

47:59.793 --> 48:00.919
dig in tight
as a tick.

48:01.003 --> 48:03.380
2nd Battalion will be deployed
over here to the east

48:03.463 --> 48:06.091
in this wooded area.

48:03.463 --> 48:06.091
Thank God.
Barely made it.

48:06.174 --> 48:08.218
Better get yourself
some ODs, Bob.

48:08.302 --> 48:09.303
Okay.

48:09.386 --> 48:11.638
1st Battalion's to the north
on your left flank.

48:11.722 --> 48:13.015
3rd Battalion's
in reserve.

48:13.098 --> 48:14.099
Andy, let's roll.

48:14.182 --> 48:15.517
Sir, we're a little short
on ammunition.

48:15.601 --> 48:17.978
-How short?
-There was a limited supply
in camp, sir.

48:18.061 --> 48:20.480
Cap'n, you beg, borrow,
or steal ammo,

48:20.564 --> 48:22.524
but you defend
this area.

48:22.608 --> 48:24.568
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

48:34.786 --> 48:37.289
Jesus Christ.

48:40.709 --> 48:44.338
Hey, Bill, Don,
come here, look at this.

48:44.421 --> 48:45.339
Come here,
look at this.

48:45.422 --> 48:47.883
Hold on.

48:45.422 --> 48:47.883
Jesus, I'm done.

48:51.720 --> 48:54.348
What the...

49:00.103 --> 49:01.855
What the hell
is going on?

49:01.938 --> 49:04.483
Hey, you're going
the wrong way.

49:04.566 --> 49:06.485
Hey, pal.

49:06.568 --> 49:07.527
Hey, pal.

49:07.611 --> 49:08.904
Hey, pal,
what happened?

49:08.987 --> 49:10.072
Where the hell
are you going?

49:10.155 --> 49:13.075
They came out of nowhere.
They slaughtered us.

49:13.158 --> 49:14.242
You gotta
get outta here.

49:14.326 --> 49:15.410
We just got here.

49:15.494 --> 49:16.870
Gimme your ammo.

49:16.953 --> 49:17.871
C'mon.

49:17.954 --> 49:19.498
Take it.
You'll need it.

49:19.581 --> 49:22.292
Go on,
get out of here.

49:26.004 --> 49:28.256
Holy Christ.

49:30.175 --> 49:31.718
Hey, who's got ammo?

49:31.802 --> 49:33.804
You got ammo?

49:33.887 --> 49:34.930
Gimme your ammo.

49:35.013 --> 49:36.014
Who's got ammo?

49:36.098 --> 49:37.099
You got any grenades?

49:37.182 --> 49:38.225
C'mon,
hand 'em over.

49:38.308 --> 49:39.226
Gimme it.

49:39.309 --> 49:41.520
You got grenades?

49:41.603 --> 49:43.355
Got any grenades, Lieb?

49:43.438 --> 49:44.523
Who's got grenades?

49:44.606 --> 49:48.193
Private? Private,
what have you got?

49:48.276 --> 49:51.196
Make a hole!

49:51.279 --> 49:52.280
Make a hole!

49:52.364 --> 49:54.032
Hey, make a hole.

49:54.116 --> 49:57.035
I got ammo.
Grab what you can.

49:57.119 --> 49:59.204
Lieutenant,
you're a godsend.

49:59.287 --> 50:00.330
What's the situation?

50:00.414 --> 50:02.040
Well, I heard you guys
were coming in.

50:02.124 --> 50:03.792
There was
an ammo dump, so...

50:03.875 --> 50:05.627
Here.

50:05.711 --> 50:07.587
Is it just you guys
in the 101st?

50:07.671 --> 50:08.672
Looks like.

50:08.755 --> 50:09.756
What hit you fellows?

50:09.840 --> 50:10.841
Everything.

50:10.924 --> 50:15.137
The Krauts had Tigers,
Panthers, SPs, Stukas...

50:15.220 --> 50:18.515
and infantry
that just kept on coming.

50:18.598 --> 50:19.766
What's
your name, Lieutenant?

50:19.850 --> 50:21.810
George Rice,
10th Armor.

50:21.893 --> 50:22.853
Good work, son.

50:22.936 --> 50:24.229
You got any more
mortar rounds, sir?

50:24.312 --> 50:25.397
We're real short.

50:25.480 --> 50:27.315
Well, I'll try to make
another ammo run if I can

50:27.399 --> 50:28.817
but, ah,
don't count on anything.

50:28.900 --> 50:32.112
Thank you, sir,
I'll take this, Cap'n.

50:32.195 --> 50:34.906
A Panzer Division's
about to cut the road south.

50:34.990 --> 50:39.035
Looks like you guys
are gonna be surrounded.

50:39.119 --> 50:40.746
We're paratroopers,
Lieutenant.

50:40.829 --> 50:42.914
We're supposed
to be surrounded.

50:42.998 --> 50:44.583
Good luck.

50:44.666 --> 50:46.251
Thanks.

52:36.069 --> 52:40.824
