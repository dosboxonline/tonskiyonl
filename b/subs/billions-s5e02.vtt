Close enough.

55:19.817 --> 55:22.945
hell, I'm there to win.

Every damn day.

So I do what I do.

You?

No. Never.

56:03.110 --> 56:04.820
Until today.

56:04.862 --> 56:06.822
You know, they call us traders

56:04.862 --> 56:06.822
'gamblers.'

56:06.864 --> 56:09.449
The world economy's

56:06.864 --> 56:09.449
just one big casino,

56:09.491 --> 56:13.704
fueled by a giant debt bubble

56:09.491 --> 56:13.704
and computer driven derivatives.

56:13.745 --> 56:15.122
And there's only

56:13.745 --> 56:15.122
one thing better

56:15.164 --> 56:17.124
than being a gambler

56:15.164 --> 56:17.124
at a casino.

56:17.166 --> 56:19.168
That's being the house.

56:17.166 --> 56:19.168
That is right.

56:19.210 --> 56:21.128
There's a systemized machine

56:19.210 --> 56:21.128
out there

56:21.170 --> 56:23.379
sucking capital

56:21.170 --> 56:23.379
from localities

56:23.421 --> 56:25.007
and injecting it into

56:23.421 --> 56:25.007
the global markets--

56:25.049 --> 56:28.344
where it can be used to

56:25.049 --> 56:28.344
speculate and manipulate.

56:28.384 --> 56:30.512
And if something goes wrong,

56:28.384 --> 56:30.512
there are bailouts

56:30.554 --> 56:33.224
and bail-ins,

56:30.554 --> 56:33.224
federal aid and easing.

56:33.265 --> 56:35.267
Where the government

56:33.265 --> 56:35.267
doesn't hunt you down,

56:35.309 --> 56:37.853
but instead gives you

56:35.309 --> 56:37.853
a nice soft net to land in.

56:37.895 --> 56:39.897
That's your answer

56:39.938 --> 56:41.148
You want to become a bank.

56:41.190 --> 56:42.566
I want to become a bank.

56:42.607 --> 56:43.775
In order to rob it?

56:43.817 --> 56:46.362
In order that

Maybe selling me out

come to realize

57:47.214 --> 57:49.174
the ways in which

57:47.214 --> 57:49.174
Axe and I are alike.

57:50.634 --> 57:55.431
We both are possessed of

57:50.634 --> 57:55.431
and by a sort of monster.

But unlike Axe,

I am in control of mine.

58:00.144 --> 58:02.479
I have a code.

No.
