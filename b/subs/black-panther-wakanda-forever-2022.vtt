<i>Bast...</i>

00:06.798 --> 00:08.717

00:09.884 --> 00:12.387
<i>Please allow me to heal</i>
<i>my brother of this illness,</i>

00:13.054 --> 00:15.598
and I will never
question your existence again.

00:16.641 --> 00:18.393
His heart rate is dropping
fast. Where are we?

00:18.476 --> 00:19.811
We are finishing
a sequence now.

00:19.894 --> 00:21.438
GRIOT,
give me the controls.

00:21.604 --> 00:22.897
GRIOT:<i> As you wish, Princess.</i>

00:28.820 --> 00:30.071
What is the confidence rate?

00:30.655 --> 00:31.823
<i>25%.</i>

00:32.490 --> 00:33.950
We'll have to try another way.

00:34.576 --> 00:35.785
GRIOT:
<i>King T'Challa's heart rate</i>

00:35.869 --> 00:38.079
<i>has fallen to 31 beats</i>

00:38.163 --> 00:40.790
Princess,
you should go be by his side.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.293
I have to think.
Everyone, get out.

00:44.711 --> 00:45.712
Get out!

00:51.926 --> 00:53.094
What is the confidence rate?

00:53.178 --> 00:54.596
<i>29.1%.</i>

00:54.679 --> 00:55.722
Print it!

<i>Princess,</i>
<i>I am aware of the urgency,</i>

01:02.645 --> 01:04.272
<i>but I must warn you,</i>

01:04.355 --> 01:06.232
<i>this synthetic</i>
<i>Heart-Shaped Herb</i>

01:06.316 --> 01:08.777
<i>has a minimal chance of</i>
<i>producing the desired effects.</i>

01:08.860 --> 01:11.863
I don't care! Has to work.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.175
GRIOT.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.301
<i>Yes, Princess?</i>

01:34.177 --> 01:35.720
What's my brother's
heart rate?

01:40.767 --> 01:42.102
Your brother

01:43.186 --> 01:45.688
is with the ancestors.

01:52.695 --> 01:54.030
No.

01:58.076 --> 02:05.083
We give thanks
for the gift of King T'Challa.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.254
The Black Panther.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.551
Son of King T'Chaka.

02:15.718 --> 02:16.970
My son.

02:17.053 --> 02:22.183
Descendant of the most revered
King Bashenga,

02:23.017 --> 02:25.687
the first Black Panther.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.605
We release you.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.190
Praise the ancestors.

02:29.315 --> 02:30.400
Praise the ancestors.

04:50.206 --> 04:52.083
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

06:35.436 --> 06:37.146
It is an honor for me...

06:37.230 --> 06:39.899
to invite her majesty,
Queen Ramonda,

06:39.982 --> 06:41.401
daughter of Lumumba,

06:41.484 --> 06:43.444
sovereign ruler
of the kingdom of Wakanda.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.626
US SECRETARY OF STATE:
Mr. Chairperson,

06:59.627 --> 07:04.215
I believe I speak for
all the member states here

07:04.298 --> 07:07.093
when I say that
I am deeply disappointed

07:07.176 --> 07:09.262
in Wakanda's failure

07:09.345 --> 07:13.808
to stand by promises to
participate in global efforts

07:13.891 --> 07:15.977
to tackle
international challenges,

07:16.060 --> 07:17.562
to share resources,

07:17.645 --> 07:19.856
and full cooperation

07:19.939 --> 07:21.399
concerning vibranium.

07:21.482 --> 07:24.527
France has information

07:24.610 --> 07:28.823
that vibranium can be used to make
weapons of mass destruction.

07:28.906 --> 07:32.577
It does not trigger
any known metal detector.

07:33.578 --> 07:39.083
It is a threat to global security
and the non-proliferation regime.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.710
I now give the floor

07:40.793 --> 07:42.712
to Her Majesty, Queen Ramonda.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.680
It has always been our policy

07:52.763 --> 07:57.768
to never trade vibranium
under any circumstance.

07:57.852 --> 08:02.148
Not because of the dangerous
potential of vibranium,

08:03.024 --> 08:07.820
but because of the dangerous
potential of you.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.083
I just lost security visuals.

08:25.713 --> 08:28.382
Down on your stomachs right now!

08:28.466 --> 08:29.759
Face to the floor! Go! Go!

08:29.842 --> 08:32.345
Where are the vibranium tools?

08:36.224 --> 08:37.225
Who has access?

08:48.236 --> 08:52.114
You perform civility here.

08:53.115 --> 08:55.201
But we know what you whisper

08:55.826 --> 08:57.578
in your halls of leadership

08:57.662 --> 09:00.540
and in your
military facilities.

09:04.752 --> 09:07.672
"The King is dead.

09:09.465 --> 09:12.426
"The Black Panther is gone.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.598
"They have lost
their protector.

09:23.521 --> 09:26.732
"Now is our time...

09:28.234 --> 09:29.360
"to strike."

09:56.554 --> 09:58.431
Aneka, where is your spear?

09:58.514 --> 10:00.016
Shuri gave me these to try.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.645
You know, I like them better.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.397
Our foremothers
gave us the spear...

10:06.480 --> 10:09.150
because it is precise,
elegant...

10:10.818 --> 10:11.861
and deadly.

10:14.822 --> 10:17.158
It will not change
under my watch.

10:19.076 --> 10:20.536
Yes, General.

10:21.203 --> 10:22.955
I told you not to bring them.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.960
Last night
there was another attack

10:28.044 --> 10:30.546
on one of
our outreach facilities.

10:31.464 --> 10:35.301
Proof of the involvement
of a member state

10:35.384 --> 10:39.388
is being uploaded to your
mobile devices as we speak.

10:40.681 --> 10:43.392
And as for the identity
of the attackers...

10:56.238 --> 10:57.657
Kneel!

11:01.285 --> 11:02.495
You're welcome.

11:03.162 --> 11:06.624
Let our gracious
response to this incursion

11:07.625 --> 11:09.126
be an olive branch.

11:11.128 --> 11:14.090
Further attempts
on our resources

11:14.173 --> 11:17.468
will be considered
an act of aggression

11:17.551 --> 11:21.180
and met with
a much steeper response.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.351
We mourn the loss of our king.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.771
But do not think for a second

11:28.854 --> 11:31.148
that Wakanda
has lost her ability

11:31.232 --> 11:33.776
to protect our resources.

11:34.443 --> 11:38.072
We are aware
of the ongoing efforts by some

11:38.155 --> 11:41.325
to find vibranium
outside of Wakanda,

11:41.409 --> 11:45.663
and wish you the best of luck.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.545
PILOT:
<i>This is Rotor 625</i>

11:58.008 --> 11:59.218
DR. GRAHAM: All right.
Meet you down there.

11:59.301 --> 12:00.302
Yeah.

12:02.847 --> 12:03.848
Hey!

12:04.724 --> 12:06.016
I thought you retired!

12:06.100 --> 12:07.226
I thought I had too.

12:07.309 --> 12:09.520
They said that machine
had a one in a billion chance

12:09.603 --> 12:10.771
of finding vibranium.

12:10.855 --> 12:11.939
Oh, less than that.

12:33.753 --> 12:34.920
Here we go.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.006
<i>Cabin pressure is stable</i>

12:37.089 --> 12:38.924
<i>at negative one P-S-I.</i>

<i>At 800 feet,</i>

<i>All my life supports</i>

13:02.156 --> 13:03.657
<i>We've touched down.</i>

13:11.207 --> 13:13.125
DR. GRAHAM:
Perfect. So, Salazar,

13:13.209 --> 13:14.835
you are near the site
right there.

13:16.086 --> 13:18.214
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>it's astonishing.</i>

13:20.216 --> 13:21.550
<i>The drill</i>
<i>seemed to make contact</i>

13:21.634 --> 13:23.010
<i>with a metallic substance.</i>

13:24.011 --> 13:26.305
<i>Whatever it is,</i>
<i>it's solid.</i>

13:26.388 --> 13:28.682
<i>I've never seen a drill bit</i>
<i>chewed up like this before.</i>

13:32.102 --> 13:33.312
I'll be.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.523
Vibranium in the ocean.

13:35.606 --> 13:37.566
Let's go ahead and get
the detector out of there,

13:37.650 --> 13:39.401
since it's the only one
we've got.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.863
<i>Heading towards</i>
<i>the vibranium detector.</i>

13:54.291 --> 13:55.960
Okay, Salazar,
we just went dark.

13:56.043 --> 13:58.254
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>The rig lost power.</i>

13:58.337 --> 14:00.047
Copy that.
I'm gonna fix it up here.

14:16.438 --> 14:17.648
JACKSON:<i> What the hell was that?</i>

14:31.078 --> 14:32.288
SALAZAR:<i> Jackson,</i>

14:32.371 --> 14:34.206
<i>tell me you're seeing this?</i>

14:34.290 --> 14:36.458
DR. GRAHAM: Hang on.
Salazar's heart rate.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.669
Hey, uh, Salazar,
can you give me a visual?

14:40.588 --> 14:42.798
SALAZAR:
<i>It's a phantom jellyfish.</i>

14:42.882 --> 14:44.508
<i>I've never seen one</i>
<i>this color.</i>

14:45.175 --> 14:46.594
Emergency dive team, stand by.

14:46.677 --> 14:49.763
Salazar, uh,
we just lost Jackson's vitals.

14:49.847 --> 14:50.973
<i>Can you see him?</i>

14:58.689 --> 15:00.608
<i>No. He's gone.</i>

15:00.691 --> 15:02.693
Can you clarify? What do
you mean by, "He's gone"?

15:04.445 --> 15:05.946
Salazar, do you copy?

15:07.156 --> 15:08.824
-Salazar?

15:11.952 --> 15:14.246
<i>Smitty,</i>
<i>we got a situation out here.</i>

15:26.216 --> 15:27.259
What's that sound?

15:27.343 --> 15:29.386
West, you got a visual
on what's making that sound?

15:35.976 --> 15:37.394
West, how copy, over?

15:40.773 --> 15:42.149
<i>West, you got a visual?</i>

16:01.210 --> 16:02.670
It's some kind
of sonic attack.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.421
Hey, Smitty, earplugs.

16:11.470 --> 16:12.763
We are under attack.

16:12.846 --> 16:14.723
You need to send in
a strike team immediately.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.935
Copy. Mayday, mayday,
this is Rotor 625.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.395
We are requesting
assistance immediately.

16:19.478 --> 16:20.771
It's the Wakandans.

16:22.856 --> 16:23.983
It has to be.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.625
Henderson.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.043
Smitty, we gotta go.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.128
Henderson!

16:45.212 --> 16:46.672
Let's go.

16:48.882 --> 16:49.883
What's going on?

16:50.551 --> 16:51.677
Get off the edge.

17:08.068 --> 17:09.403
Go!

17:29.757 --> 17:31.383
Go, go, go, go!

17:38.557 --> 17:39.600
Now! Go!

17:39.683 --> 17:41.727
Spin! Spin them off!

17:42.603 --> 17:44.229
Okay. They're gone!

17:44.313 --> 17:46.440
-Oh, my God!

18:04.958 --> 18:06.085
DR. GRAHAM: Just get us out.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.628
We're good.

18:07.711 --> 18:09.046
-We're good.

18:09.129 --> 18:10.255
Where is the strike team?

18:10.506 --> 18:12.633
It wasn't the Wakandans.
They... They were blue.

18:12.716 --> 18:13.801
Everyone is dead...

18:16.053 --> 18:17.429
Shit. What is going on?

18:17.513 --> 18:19.348
We're getting
pulled backwards.

18:20.474 --> 18:21.934
Oh, my God.

18:26.563 --> 18:28.857
-Oh, God! Hang on!

19:03.725 --> 19:05.727
<i>Queen Ramonda</i>
<i>of the nation of Wakanda</i>

19:05.811 --> 19:07.938

My Queen.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.710
Approaching the river border.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.718

20:27.809 --> 20:28.977
<i>Princess.</i>

20:29.061 --> 20:30.103
Just a moment.

20:30.187 --> 20:31.521

20:31.605 --> 20:33.232
GRIOT:<i> I understand,</i>

Mother.

<i>I was trying</i>

20:42.241 --> 20:44.243
<i>The Queen is here.</i>

20:44.326 --> 20:46.453
-Thank you.
-That thing unnerves me.

20:46.536 --> 20:47.788
I think that one day

20:47.871 --> 20:50.165
artificial intelligence
is going to kill us all.

20:50.249 --> 20:53.085
My AI isn't like the movies,

20:53.168 --> 20:54.878
It does exactly
what I tell it to do.

20:54.962 --> 20:57.547
Yeah, if only children
were the same.

20:58.757 --> 21:01.468
Everyone seems to be
working diligently.

21:02.135 --> 21:05.681
Yes. Rapid emergency
response task.

21:06.348 --> 21:07.474
There could be any number of

21:07.557 --> 21:09.226
unknown threats
on the horizon,

21:09.309 --> 21:10.978
and they're
creating solutions.

21:11.979 --> 21:14.022
Oh, what is this?

21:14.106 --> 21:15.816
Exo Suits for our army.

21:15.899 --> 21:18.402
It grants the user
super-human strength,

21:18.485 --> 21:20.654
speed, and durability.

21:20.737 --> 21:23.156
But, as always,
Okoye had notes.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.491
What were her notes?

21:24.574 --> 21:25.951
She hates them.

21:26.034 --> 21:27.035
Oh.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.667
What about recreating
the Heart-Shaped Herb?

21:33.750 --> 21:35.961
Have you made
any progress on that?

21:36.044 --> 21:37.254
<i>Excuse me, Princess.</i>

21:37.337 --> 21:40.549

21:41.717 --> 21:43.468
Maybe you should
continue your calculations

21:43.552 --> 21:44.720
as I instructed.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.305
<i>As you wish, Princess.</i>

21:47.806 --> 21:49.349
We do not need the herb,
Mother.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.394
We need new technology.

21:52.477 --> 21:53.729
What of the Black Panther?

21:56.940 --> 22:00.610
The mantle has unified
our nation for centuries.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.863
The Black Panther
is a relic, Mother.

22:02.946 --> 22:05.449
I wasn't trying to save
the mantle with the herb,

22:05.532 --> 22:07.701
I was trying
to save my brother.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.163
Oh, Shuri.

22:24.885 --> 22:26.678
Do you know what day it is?

22:26.762 --> 22:27.763
Tuesday.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.557
The date, child.

22:36.813 --> 22:38.065
Brother's passing.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.025
One year ago today.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.244
Have you planned anything?

22:51.328 --> 22:55.248
Yes. It involves you taking
your mother for a drive.

22:55.832 --> 22:57.250
-Right now?
-Right now.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.544
And you can leave
your Kimoyo Beads here.

22:59.628 --> 23:00.754
-Mother.
-No, no.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.672
You won't need them
where we are going.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.425
Hmm?

23:07.427 --> 23:10.389
And the other two. Yes.

23:34.162 --> 23:37.999
You need to sit here with me.
And with yourself.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.669
It is the only way
you are going to heal

23:40.752 --> 23:43.088
from the wound caused
by T'Challa's death.

23:43.171 --> 23:44.464
I'm fine, Mother.

23:45.882 --> 23:47.843
You don't have to worry
about me.

23:49.094 --> 23:52.722
He's gone,
but I'm moving forward.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.641
T'Challa is dead,

23:54.724 --> 23:57.602
but that doesn't mean
he is gone.

23:58.103 --> 24:00.981
When that illness
took your brother from us,

24:01.148 --> 24:05.652
I had to lead a wounded nation
and a broken world.

24:05.819 --> 24:08.530
But I still took time
in the bush.

24:08.697 --> 24:11.950
I wandered
until I found water.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.493
And I sat.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.788
Then I did this ritual

24:16.955 --> 24:19.332
that I am about
to show you now.

24:21.918 --> 24:26.131
I found your brother
in the breeze,

24:27.424 --> 24:30.802
pushing me gently, but firm.

24:31.803 --> 24:33.972
Like his hand on my shoulder.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.809
It took some time,

24:39.186 --> 24:41.146
but he was there.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.778
He wasn't there, Mother.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.032
The presence that you felt

24:52.115 --> 24:54.034
was just a construct
of your mind.

24:56.244 --> 24:59.998
Brought on so you could feel
some comfort or joy.

25:00.540 --> 25:02.125
That's all.

25:03.710 --> 25:04.878
Hmm.

25:09.007 --> 25:11.885
What construct
does your mind create

25:12.052 --> 25:14.012
when you think
of your brother?

25:14.971 --> 25:16.932
Does it offer you comfort?

25:18.308 --> 25:19.684
Or torment?

25:33.365 --> 25:34.449
Come, child.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.212
How did you get this?

25:47.379 --> 25:48.505
What does it matter?

25:49.339 --> 25:51.132
What does this have to do
with your ritual?

25:52.300 --> 25:54.636
Burning
of the funeral garments

25:54.803 --> 25:57.055
marks the end
of the mourning period

25:57.222 --> 26:00.141
and the beginning
of a new relationship

26:00.225 --> 26:02.477
with our loved ones
that have passed on...

26:02.978 --> 26:04.563
I'm not doing this, Mother.

26:05.897 --> 26:07.274
If I sit

26:07.440 --> 26:09.985
and think about my brother
for too long,

26:11.486 --> 26:14.281
it won't be these clothes
I'll burn.

26:15.532 --> 26:17.075
It will be the world...

26:18.493 --> 26:20.036
and everyone in it.

26:20.370 --> 26:22.372
Shuri...

26:26.835 --> 26:29.754
Shuri, there's something
that I need to tell you

26:30.338 --> 26:31.548
about your brother.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.095
Mother, wait!

26:37.679 --> 26:39.639
-What are you doing?

27:04.414 --> 27:06.333
This better not be
a part of your ritual.

27:06.416 --> 27:07.751
It isn't.

27:09.377 --> 27:11.046
Stop! Right there!

27:11.713 --> 27:14.549
Who are you?
And how did you get in here?

27:16.092 --> 27:17.594
This place is amazing.

27:18.511 --> 27:20.597
The air is pristine.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.058
And the water...

27:24.601 --> 27:26.728
My mother told stories
about a place like this.

27:27.062 --> 27:30.231
A protected land with people
that never have to leave.

27:30.398 --> 27:32.734
That never have to change
who they were.

27:34.319 --> 27:35.403
What reason do you have

27:35.487 --> 27:37.280
to reveal your secret
to the world?

27:37.364 --> 27:40.325
I am not a woman
who enjoys repeating herself.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.369
Who are you?

27:42.535 --> 27:43.745
I have many names.

27:44.371 --> 27:47.457
My people call me
K'uk'ulkan...

27:50.377 --> 27:52.087
but my enemies call me Namor.

27:53.880 --> 27:56.424
The American military
detected vibranium

27:56.508 --> 27:58.093
under my nation's domain.

27:59.094 --> 28:02.639
I was able to
stop them from minin' it,

28:03.556 --> 28:04.849
but we need Wakanda's help

28:04.933 --> 28:06.685
to prevent it
from happenin' again.

28:07.811 --> 28:10.772
They use a machine designed
by an American scientist.

28:10.939 --> 28:13.441
Vibranium only exists here.

28:13.608 --> 28:14.943
In Wakanda.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.486
Mother, he's covered in it.

28:20.365 --> 28:24.119
Your son exposed the power
of vibranium to the world.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.996
In response,
other nations have begun

28:27.080 --> 28:28.498
searching the planet for it.

28:28.665 --> 28:32.085
His choice has compromised us.

28:32.877 --> 28:35.255
I think Wakanda
could find the scientist

28:35.338 --> 28:36.631
and bring them to me?

28:37.382 --> 28:41.386
It is only fair that Wakanda
helps to resolve our dilemma.

28:41.553 --> 28:44.013
You do not sneak
into my country

28:44.097 --> 28:46.808
and tell me what is fair.

28:48.268 --> 28:51.354
I have more soldiers than
this land has blades of grass.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.858
And they have
incomparable strength.

28:55.358 --> 28:58.486
I would hate to come back
under different circumstances.

29:04.492 --> 29:06.953
When you have the scientist,
blow into this,

29:07.120 --> 29:08.455
place it in the ocean.

29:08.913 --> 29:10.915
I'll be there
shortly afterwards.

29:14.461 --> 29:15.670
For your own sake,

29:16.171 --> 29:18.089
don't mention
anything about me

29:18.173 --> 29:19.966
to anyone outside of Wakanda.

29:28.683 --> 29:30.602
Did you see the wings
on his ankles?

29:46.993 --> 29:48.203
How did he do that?

29:48.953 --> 29:50.580
RAMONDA:
We must convene the Council.

29:52.415 --> 29:54.209
Heaven Scrapers
had no evidence

29:54.292 --> 29:56.002
of any activity at all.

29:58.087 --> 30:02.926
Oh, the river border
has been breached, huh?

30:03.009 --> 30:04.469
If my soldiers were present,

30:04.886 --> 30:07.096
this "fish man"

30:07.263 --> 30:09.098
would be bound before us
as we speak.

30:09.182 --> 30:11.434
If your muscle brains
were present,

30:11.601 --> 30:12.894
they would still be there

30:12.977 --> 30:14.771
choking on their
fuzzy adornments.

30:14.854 --> 30:16.105
You bald-headed demon...

30:16.189 --> 30:18.066
Show some respect, you two.

30:18.149 --> 30:19.234
M'BAKU: Respect?

30:19.317 --> 30:21.820
These men should be
ashamed to show their faces!

30:21.903 --> 30:22.987
Watch your tone, Jabari!

30:36.417 --> 30:37.961
As I was saying,

30:38.127 --> 30:40.922
there was no aerial
surveillance footage of him.

30:41.005 --> 30:42.340
And nothing
on the radar as well.

30:42.507 --> 30:45.969
So, he swam underwater
for 100 kilometers.

30:46.135 --> 30:47.637
He was not alone.

30:47.720 --> 30:50.014
And claims to command
a massive army.

30:50.098 --> 30:54.394
He wants us to deliver
one American scientist?

30:54.477 --> 30:55.520
So he can kill them?

30:55.603 --> 30:56.688
Do it.

30:58.982 --> 31:00.775
We never had to face an enemy

31:00.859 --> 31:02.610
with access
to vibranium before.

31:03.570 --> 31:05.572
And we have no Black Panther
to protect us.

31:05.655 --> 31:07.282
M'BAKU: That is because
this wise Council

31:07.365 --> 31:09.951
allowed Killmonger
to take the throne

31:10.118 --> 31:12.078
and burn up all of your
precious Heart-Shaped Herb.

31:12.161 --> 31:14.664
M'Baku,
what would you have us do?

31:14.831 --> 31:17.208
We should find the fish man
and kill him.

31:18.001 --> 31:21.963
If we do
what he is asking for now,

31:22.130 --> 31:24.549
what is to stop him
from coming back

31:24.632 --> 31:26.426
and asking for more?

31:35.852 --> 31:36.895
As you were.

31:38.605 --> 31:42.734
Is it just me, or does this
keep getting uglier?

31:43.067 --> 31:44.068
It's you.

31:44.861 --> 31:46.779
-So, does it work?
-Yes.

31:46.946 --> 31:48.364
This thing can detect

31:48.448 --> 31:50.658
the altered frequency
of vibranium

31:50.825 --> 31:53.953
through water, stones,
even heavy metals.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.830
Whoever built this
is brilliant.

31:56.164 --> 31:57.582
Come, look.

31:58.166 --> 32:00.835
Some are custom parts
and others look like

32:01.002 --> 32:02.754
they gathered it
from a junkyard.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.173
I am still struggling
to believe

32:05.256 --> 32:08.217
that vibranium exists
outside of Wakanda.

32:08.384 --> 32:10.637
Perhaps there was
more than one meteorite.

32:10.803 --> 32:12.513
Our planet is covered
of mostly water,

32:12.597 --> 32:13.681
so it's reasonable

32:13.765 --> 32:15.808
that the other one
just landed there.

32:15.975 --> 32:18.061
This changes everything
that we know.

32:18.227 --> 32:21.689
The Great Mound.
All of the legends and fables.

32:22.398 --> 32:24.275
Those stories
are seared in my mind.

32:24.442 --> 32:26.235
That sounds very painful.

32:28.529 --> 32:30.531
So we have to find
this scientist after all.

32:32.158 --> 32:33.868
-I do have an idea.
-Mm.

32:34.661 --> 32:35.995
I'm going to need
the princess.

32:36.162 --> 32:38.164
Out of the question.

32:38.247 --> 32:40.458
She is in no state
to be in the field.

32:40.541 --> 32:41.918
My Queen,

32:42.835 --> 32:45.380
it may
do her some good to get out.

32:45.838 --> 32:48.508
It might just be exactly
what she needs.

32:49.050 --> 32:52.011
Besides, I can do
this American operation

32:52.095 --> 32:53.179
with my eyes closed.

32:53.262 --> 32:56.474
It's not the Americans
that I'm worried about.

32:56.641 --> 32:58.059
This Namor,

32:58.476 --> 33:00.478
he snuck past our defenses.

33:00.561 --> 33:02.563
That will never happen again.

33:02.647 --> 33:04.232
He was not alone.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.150
She'll be with me.

33:07.402 --> 33:08.403
So,

33:09.362 --> 33:10.446
when are we leavin'

33:10.530 --> 33:12.865
so I can see
my favorite colonizer?

33:12.949 --> 33:15.576


33:23.459 --> 33:24.585
<i>Can't stop</i>

33:24.669 --> 33:26.421
<i>-Addicted to the shindig</i>

33:26.504 --> 33:28.798
<i>Chop Top,</i>
<i>he says I'm gonna win big...</i>

33:30.883 --> 33:31.884
Whoa.

33:31.968 --> 33:34.137
<i>Distant cousin</i>
<i>to the reservation</i>

33:34.220 --> 33:36.889
<i>Defunkt the pistol</i>
<i>that you pay for</i>

33:36.973 --> 33:39.308
<i>This punk, the feeling</i>
<i>that you stay for...</i>

33:41.519 --> 33:42.854
Come on.

33:44.856 --> 33:46.315
Yeah, I got it.

33:47.233 --> 33:48.609
I got it.

33:50.778 --> 33:52.113
Will you slow down?

33:59.078 --> 34:00.371
You didn't think to call?

34:00.538 --> 34:01.914
Now, why would I have
your number?

34:04.500 --> 34:05.793
We are looking
for the scientist

34:05.877 --> 34:07.670
who built
the vibranium detector.

34:08.087 --> 34:09.380
So it was you guys
in the Atlantic?

34:10.423 --> 34:12.091
Come on. Mining ship.

34:12.258 --> 34:13.509
Lot of casualties.

34:14.218 --> 34:15.219
What happened?

34:15.386 --> 34:16.429
Seriously?

34:18.431 --> 34:21.309
It was a joint operation.
Us and the SEALs.

34:21.476 --> 34:24.437
Thirty of their top guys,
two of our best officers,

34:24.604 --> 34:25.605
friends of mine.

34:26.064 --> 34:27.065
Gone.

34:27.231 --> 34:28.274
Just like that.

34:28.733 --> 34:29.734
You throw in the fact

34:29.817 --> 34:30.818
that they were tracking
vibranium...

34:30.902 --> 34:33.571
I can assure you Wakanda
had nothing to do with this.

34:34.489 --> 34:35.573
So who was it?

34:37.158 --> 34:39.035
God, look, the way that
this is supposed to work

34:39.118 --> 34:41.245
is that I give you information
and you reciprocate.

34:41.329 --> 34:43.998
For our own safety,
we cannot tell you.

34:44.165 --> 34:46.250
It's imperative that
we get to the scientist

34:46.417 --> 34:47.919
before anything else happens.

34:48.753 --> 34:50.505
You owe me, Ross.

34:50.671 --> 34:52.173
You owe my brother.

34:56.010 --> 34:57.011
Okay, look.

34:57.804 --> 35:00.056
There are agents who have
been sentenced to death

35:00.223 --> 35:02.308
for less than
I'm about to give you now.

35:02.475 --> 35:03.726
And we got a new director.

35:04.393 --> 35:05.770
She's watching me like a hawk.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.523
We will be very, very careful.

35:08.689 --> 35:10.775
Not just careful,
you gotta be fast.

35:10.858 --> 35:12.443
The US needs another machine

35:12.527 --> 35:14.112
and this kid is
the only person in the world

35:14.195 --> 35:15.446
who knows how to build one.

35:15.530 --> 35:16.572
So they're comin' for her.

35:16.656 --> 35:17.657
A kid?

35:27.750 --> 35:29.752
-Hey.
-You forgot to Venmo me.

35:29.836 --> 35:33.089
Ah, it slipped my mind.
It's eight hundred, right?

35:33.172 --> 35:34.924
Eight hundred
was yesterday's price.

35:35.007 --> 35:36.175
It's a band today.

35:36.259 --> 35:37.969
That's predatory. I...

35:39.178 --> 35:40.930
I built the whole
robotic hand.

35:41.013 --> 35:43.558
You just corrected
the grip algorithm.

35:43.724 --> 35:45.101
And what grade did you get?

35:50.815 --> 35:52.567
Thanks.

35:55.570 --> 35:56.737
SHURI:
Is that an iPhone I see?

35:56.821 --> 35:57.822
Primitive.

35:59.407 --> 36:00.408
My Queen.

36:01.367 --> 36:03.202
We have located the scientist.

36:03.286 --> 36:05.037
She is
in the American equivalent

36:05.121 --> 36:06.873
of a Wakandan village school.

36:06.956 --> 36:08.166
<i>A school?</i>

36:08.666 --> 36:11.085
<i>Please tell me</i>
<i>it is a professor.</i>

36:11.169 --> 36:13.045
It's a student, Mother.

36:13.212 --> 36:14.630
We can't give her to Namor.

36:15.464 --> 36:18.134
<i>Bring this student</i>
<i>back to Wakanda.</i>

36:19.760 --> 36:21.220
Yes, my Queen.

36:23.681 --> 36:24.765
I've got it from here.

36:25.391 --> 36:27.185
Wait. Maybe I should
speak with her.

36:27.351 --> 36:28.644
It will be more discreet.

36:29.937 --> 36:31.063
I can be discreet.

36:34.817 --> 36:35.818
What?

36:36.235 --> 36:37.403
-Nothing.
-Is it the makeup?

36:37.486 --> 36:38.487
No.

36:38.571 --> 36:39.697
It's the wrong shade,
isn't it?

36:39.780 --> 36:40.865
It's the right shade.

36:40.948 --> 36:42.533
Fenty 440. You look good.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.120
I can blend in as a student.

36:47.246 --> 36:48.247
I can do this.

36:52.084 --> 36:53.586
-You get five minutes.
-Yes!

37:05.848 --> 37:06.849
Yo!

37:07.016 --> 37:08.100
Riri Williams?

37:11.520 --> 37:13.064
Yo, I don't do drop-bys
no more.

37:13.147 --> 37:14.232
You gotta go to the website.

37:15.691 --> 37:17.610
It's an encrypted file.

37:17.777 --> 37:18.945
I wanted to airdrop it.

37:19.445 --> 37:21.280
You the...

37:22.823 --> 37:23.824
Whew.

37:23.908 --> 37:25.493
You're Princess Shuri.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.663
What the hell
are you doing here?

37:28.829 --> 37:30.456
Oh, shit,
am I getting recruited?

37:32.250 --> 37:33.251
No.

37:33.793 --> 37:35.586
I'm here about
the vibranium detector

37:35.670 --> 37:37.171
that you built for the CIA.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.841
I ain't built no detector
for no CIA.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.593
I made that
for my metallurgy class.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.762
-A school project?
-Yeah.

37:45.137 --> 37:46.931
My professor said
I'd never be able to do it.

37:48.474 --> 37:50.601
To be young, gifted,
and Black though, right?

37:53.729 --> 37:55.898
Y'all probably don't say that
in Wakanda.

37:58.192 --> 37:59.235
How old are you?

38:00.194 --> 38:01.487
Nineteen.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.155
Brilliance at a young age

38:03.239 --> 38:05.783
is not always accepted
by the elders.

38:07.201 --> 38:08.786
How long did it take you?

38:08.953 --> 38:10.037
Couple months.

38:10.204 --> 38:11.872
-Couple months?
-The hardest part was

38:11.956 --> 38:13.791
finding big enough
mylar sheets to cover the...

38:15.543 --> 38:17.086
Wait, did I piss off Wakanda?

38:17.169 --> 38:18.254
Not just us.

38:18.838 --> 38:20.339
This place is no longer safe
for you.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.634
Gather your things
and come with me. Right now.

38:24.510 --> 38:27.513
I got Differential Equations
class in, like, 15 minutes.

38:30.016 --> 38:31.017
Okay.

38:32.101 --> 38:33.311
Okay.

38:33.477 --> 38:35.688
You wait right here.

38:36.522 --> 38:39.191
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'm just gonna...

38:39.608 --> 38:40.609
Ooh!

38:42.653 --> 38:44.280
I had it under control.

38:45.197 --> 38:47.700
I said five minutes.
I gave you six.

38:47.867 --> 38:49.535
Get out. Get out of my dorm.

38:50.202 --> 38:51.370
Get out!

38:51.537 --> 38:52.538
Hey.

38:52.705 --> 38:55.541
I'm warning you!
Do not take another step

38:55.624 --> 38:56.625
-toward me!
-Oh!

38:56.709 --> 38:57.877
See how they teach
the children

38:57.960 --> 38:59.253
to treat their guests? Mm!

39:03.174 --> 39:04.258
Oh...

39:04.342 --> 39:05.676
You brought a spear in here?

39:05.760 --> 39:08.137
You brought a spear in here.

39:08.846 --> 39:09.972
I like her.

39:10.473 --> 39:11.640
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

39:11.724 --> 39:13.225
-Put it down, put it...
-Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.894
You'll hurt yourself. Come on.

39:14.977 --> 39:16.645
It's all right, Princess.

39:16.729 --> 39:18.064
Small, small girl.

39:19.148 --> 39:22.068
I am going to give you
two options.

39:22.234 --> 39:24.403
You can come to Wakanda,

39:24.570 --> 39:26.864
conscious or unconscious.

39:27.656 --> 39:30.409
You need to be conscious
of the way that you look.

39:30.576 --> 39:32.536
Walking round here,
all that ash on your head.

39:34.455 --> 39:36.499
-Oh, it's funny?
-No, it's not.

39:36.707 --> 39:39.043
-Mm-hmm. I told you!
-You look good.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.878
Calm down.
We'll leave, okay?

39:41.337 --> 39:42.713
And she can deal

39:42.797 --> 39:45.466
with that merman
with the winged ankles

39:45.633 --> 39:48.552
who wants to kill her
all by herself.

39:48.719 --> 39:50.846
-You got this.
-Mm, with your heater.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.181
-Come on. Let's go.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.100
What?

40:01.190 --> 40:02.942
What exactly
is this place?

40:03.651 --> 40:05.653
I fixed a few trucks
for the head of sanitation.

40:06.445 --> 40:10.241
He lets me work out
of this garage in exchange.

40:10.741 --> 40:12.326
I just have to grab
my work laptop.

40:15.037 --> 40:17.832
Please don't touch anything.

40:17.998 --> 40:20.126
You don't have to worry
about that.

40:20.292 --> 40:21.710
It may not
look like much,

40:21.794 --> 40:23.796
but it's my life's work
in here.

40:23.879 --> 40:24.880
Mm-hmm.

40:24.964 --> 40:28.384
So, the design for the machine
is on that laptop?

40:28.551 --> 40:29.552
Yeah.

40:29.635 --> 40:32.596
And you just leave it
on a desk in a car garage?

40:32.763 --> 40:35.724
I got 2065-byte encryption
on that thing.

40:35.891 --> 40:39.019
That's impressive.
Ever locked yourself out?

40:39.186 --> 40:41.105
Took me the whole
semester to get back in.

40:41.272 --> 40:43.315
Had to build a functional
quantum computer

40:43.482 --> 40:45.401
just to crack
my own encryption.

40:45.568 --> 40:47.945
What is it you're building
here? Is it Stark Tech?

40:48.028 --> 40:49.447
I said don't touch anything.

40:49.530 --> 40:51.240
<i>Princess,</i>
<i>American law enforcement</i>

40:51.323 --> 40:52.700
<i>has arrived at your location.</i>

40:52.783 --> 40:54.243
-Shit.
-Who was that?

40:54.660 --> 40:55.661
My AI.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.747
OKOYE:
They are surrounding us.

41:02.751 --> 41:05.379
I thought you said a merman
was after me.

41:05.546 --> 41:06.589
That's the feds.

41:19.977 --> 41:22.480
Oh, I do not need this shit
right now!

41:22.563 --> 41:24.773
I swear to God,
I was doing so well!

41:24.940 --> 41:27.568
Goin' to class on time.
I must be dumb as hell.

41:27.651 --> 41:30.279
Real dumb thinking that
the Princess of Wakanda

41:30.362 --> 41:32.031
is gonna show up
at my doorstep

41:32.114 --> 41:33.741
and then shit
about to pop off.

41:33.824 --> 41:34.825
I think

41:34.909 --> 41:37.578
that I'm actually gonna take
my chances with this merman,

41:37.661 --> 41:41.373
because at least he never
brought the FBI to my garage!

41:41.540 --> 41:44.960
Hey. Namor sank an entire ship
of CIA operatives...

41:45.044 --> 41:46.462
<i>This is the Federal Bureau</i>

41:46.545 --> 41:47.546
<i>of Investigation.</i>

41:47.630 --> 41:48.672
...because of
your little machine.

41:48.756 --> 41:50.132
So those popo out there...

41:50.216 --> 41:51.342
<i>We have</i>
<i>surrounded the premises.</i>

41:51.425 --> 41:52.510
...are the very least
of your worries.

41:52.593 --> 41:55.137
Listen, we need to work
together to get out of here.

41:55.304 --> 41:57.723
General,
they've got us surrounded.

41:57.890 --> 41:59.475
Maybe we should just split up.

41:59.558 --> 42:01.060
Out of the question.

42:01.227 --> 42:02.353
Does this vehicle work?

42:03.771 --> 42:04.939
No.

42:05.940 --> 42:09.235
Everything in this lab works.
Including this bike.

42:09.401 --> 42:11.237
Don't even think about it.

42:11.320 --> 42:13.405
Besides,
there are three of us.

42:13.572 --> 42:16.033
Two of y'all. I'm takin' this.

42:16.408 --> 42:17.660
Whoo!

42:17.743 --> 42:18.994
I knew it.

42:19.161 --> 42:21.580
Don't tell me that
you built this in two months.

42:21.664 --> 42:24.708
I spent years
on this. On and off.

42:24.792 --> 42:27.670
-Nice. Have you flown it yet?

42:27.836 --> 42:28.963
That thing can fly?

42:29.046 --> 42:31.006
There's an entire
YouTube channel

42:31.090 --> 42:32.883
dedicated to sightings of me.

42:32.967 --> 42:34.051
That's awesome.

42:34.510 --> 42:35.803
<i>We have</i>
<i>a warrant to detain...</i>

42:35.886 --> 42:37.638
-Come.

42:37.721 --> 42:38.931
Wireless transmitter,

42:39.014 --> 42:40.099
so we can communicate.

42:40.182 --> 42:41.308
Don't try to scurry off.

<i>General Okoye,</i>
<i>Princess Shuri,</i>

42:43.686 --> 42:45.729
<i>come out with your hands up.</i>

42:46.438 --> 42:47.565
What a hunk of junk.

Hey, please be careful.

42:49.608 --> 42:50.901
FBI AGENT:<i> You will not</i>
<i>be placed under arrest.</i>

42:50.985 --> 42:51.986
Keys are on the seat.

42:52.152 --> 42:53.696
Once we get to
the other side of the bridge,

42:53.779 --> 42:55.030
we can lose them
in Boston traffic.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.991
General,
we really need to split up.

42:57.157 --> 42:59.243
Listen to me.
We are not in your lab.

42:59.326 --> 43:00.411
We are in the field.

43:00.578 --> 43:01.996
Now, get her in the car.

43:02.580 --> 43:03.706
Always shouting at me.

43:24.393 --> 43:26.353
-Fall back!
-Stay where you are!

Come on, Riri.

45:27.891 --> 45:30.144
You gotta find
these differential equations.

45:30.310 --> 45:32.104
Once the relative velocity
evens out...

45:32.187 --> 45:34.064
Riri, I'm not sure
you can reach that drone

45:34.231 --> 45:35.232
without an oxygen mask.

45:37.860 --> 45:40.529
<i>Oxygen level</i>
<i>is now 55%.</i>

45:41.488 --> 45:43.615
Twenty-eight
thousand feet.

45:44.742 --> 45:47.327
<i>Oxygen level</i>
<i>is now 30%.</i>

45:50.456 --> 45:51.832
Maximum acceleration.
I just need to adjust

45:51.915 --> 45:53.459
my Euler angles
and that should...

45:54.209 --> 45:55.461
that should drop it
right on the...

46:01.967 --> 46:03.802
<i>Oxygen, 0%.</i>

46:07.181 --> 46:09.141
<i>The drone is no longer</i>
<i>tracking you.</i>

46:10.058 --> 46:12.060
<i>Altitude,</i>
<i>500 feet and falling.</i>

46:12.144 --> 46:13.395
<i>Riri! Are you okay?</i>

46:14.730 --> 46:15.773
<i>-Riri!</i>
-Yeah.

46:19.359 --> 46:20.444
<i>I'm good.</i>

46:21.361 --> 46:22.404
-Incoming!
-Get out of the way!

46:22.654 --> 46:23.655
Oh my!

46:23.822 --> 46:24.865
-Shit!
-<i>And no worries.</i>

46:24.948 --> 46:26.950
<i>I got a special delivery</i>
<i>for y'all in three,</i>

46:27.117 --> 46:28.535
<i>two, one...</i>

46:30.078 --> 46:31.163
Nice one, Riri!

46:31.246 --> 46:32.581
<i>We got the glow</i>
<i>We got the soul</i>

46:32.664 --> 46:33.874
<i>We got the wave</i>

46:33.957 --> 46:35.417
Whoo!

46:40.422 --> 46:41.673
-Riri!

47:08.492 --> 47:11.578
What just happened?
Shuri!

47:12.120 --> 47:13.121
Shuri!

47:29.221 --> 47:31.473
<i>The Princess's vitals</i>
<i>are stable, General.</i>

47:31.640 --> 47:34.226
<i>She should regain</i>
<i>consciousness momentarily.</i>

48:08.677 --> 48:10.762
Take another step closer

48:11.555 --> 48:13.056
and I will kill you all.

48:13.765 --> 48:14.975
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

48:17.603 --> 48:18.770
Kill the scientist.

48:18.937 --> 48:20.564
I'll deal with the witnesses.

48:21.148 --> 48:22.149
OK.

48:23.567 --> 48:24.693
Hey, is she blue?

48:26.653 --> 48:28.363
Kill that woman first.

48:29.573 --> 48:30.574
Drop your weapon!

49:04.650 --> 49:06.693
Go to Namora.

50:15.804 --> 50:18.306
You're not worth my blade.

50:30.944 --> 50:32.487
What's taking so long?

50:32.863 --> 50:35.490
This is not a time for games.

50:44.666 --> 50:45.751
Okoye!

50:47.252 --> 50:48.253
Wait!

50:48.336 --> 50:49.713
<i>Activating</i>
<i>interpretation.</i>

50:49.796 --> 50:50.964
-I'm Shuri.

50:51.048 --> 50:52.340
Princess of Wakanda.

50:52.799 --> 50:54.593
I demand that you take me
to Namor.

50:54.760 --> 50:56.845
Do not bring harm
to this girl.

50:59.556 --> 51:01.641
<i>Do we take them both alive?</i>

51:01.933 --> 51:04.227
-<i>Yes, Attuma.</i>

51:20.535 --> 51:21.661
<i>Breathe.</i>

51:30.587 --> 51:31.588
Shuri!

51:50.023 --> 51:52.692
Ross, from the Agency.
You got any witnesses?

51:52.859 --> 51:55.070
None. But we think
it was the Wakandans.

51:55.445 --> 51:56.446
Excuse me?

51:56.530 --> 51:57.656
Our field office
got a tip from Langley

51:57.739 --> 51:58.740
that they were coming.

51:58.907 --> 52:00.700
Right. Who made that call?

52:01.743 --> 52:03.120
-She did.
-Director de Fontaine.

52:05.539 --> 52:06.915
Director de Fontaine.

52:06.998 --> 52:07.999
Really?

52:08.083 --> 52:09.084
Well...

52:10.085 --> 52:11.962
Uh, Agent thinks
it was the Wakandans.

52:12.504 --> 52:14.005
Yeah, we've been
on every one of them

52:14.089 --> 52:15.090
since they took out our ship.

52:15.173 --> 52:16.591
That's why I wanted you here.

52:17.676 --> 52:18.760
You're lookin' good.

52:18.844 --> 52:20.428
Oh. Well, I try.

52:20.595 --> 52:22.097
You put
that home gym in?

52:22.180 --> 52:23.181
Yeah. Last year.

52:23.348 --> 52:26.059
Maybe I'll drop by sometime
and jump on your Peloton.

52:26.810 --> 52:27.811
Howdy.

52:27.894 --> 52:29.646
-I'm special agent in charge.
-Oh, good for you.

52:29.729 --> 52:31.898
You wanna walk me through
the evidence here, or what?

52:32.065 --> 52:34.234
-Yeah. Okay. After you.
-Yeah. Okay.

52:34.317 --> 52:35.527
-All right.
-So, what happened here?

52:36.153 --> 52:37.737
Um, we think
it was a car crash,

52:37.904 --> 52:39.656
but we're having trouble
finding the cars.

52:39.739 --> 52:40.782
What do you mean?

52:40.866 --> 52:42.159
It was just like this
when you found it?

52:42.242 --> 52:43.869
Yes.
We think someone involved

52:43.952 --> 52:44.953
got rid of the vehicles.

52:45.036 --> 52:46.204
DE FONTAINE:
Got rid of them how?

52:46.288 --> 52:47.747
They dumped
them into the river.

52:47.914 --> 52:49.124
DE FONTAINE:
You're kidding me.

52:50.167 --> 52:51.751
It's got an MIT sticker on it.

52:51.918 --> 52:54.296
I want that transferred
to the NSA immediately.

52:54.462 --> 52:56.548
Hey, Ross?
You got a full tank of gas?

52:56.715 --> 52:58.383
Can you give me a ride
back to Langley?

52:58.466 --> 53:00.677
It's an eight-hour drive.

53:00.760 --> 53:02.137
Yeah.
We can talk about the case.

53:02.304 --> 53:04.681
Actually, wouldn't mind...

53:04.764 --> 53:06.933
apologizing to you
for a couple of things I said

53:07.017 --> 53:08.059
during our marriage.

53:11.438 --> 53:12.689
They were blue.

53:13.732 --> 53:15.567
And they had
superhuman strength.

53:16.484 --> 53:19.321
And they came from the water
on the backs of whales.

53:20.197 --> 53:21.865
I struck down three of them

53:21.948 --> 53:23.408
with blows
that should've killed them,

53:23.491 --> 53:25.202
but they rose again.

53:25.368 --> 53:28.622
I wish to leave immediately
to retrieve our princess.

53:40.425 --> 53:41.635
Okoye,

53:42.010 --> 53:44.429
you will be
stripped of your rank

53:44.512 --> 53:46.514
as General of Wakanda's armies

53:46.598 --> 53:49.559
and your status
as Dora Milaje.

53:54.356 --> 53:55.523
Permission to speak...

53:55.607 --> 53:56.900
my Queen?

53:57.859 --> 53:58.902
You may.

53:59.402 --> 54:00.862
I beg of you.

54:02.864 --> 54:04.324
I have given everything.

54:05.283 --> 54:09.079
Let me die saving my country
and that throne.

54:09.246 --> 54:11.248
I'm asking you, mother.

54:11.414 --> 54:13.208
Allow me
to make this right.

54:13.291 --> 54:14.584
"Make it right"?

54:16.211 --> 54:19.339
I do not know if my daughter
is alive or dead.

54:19.506 --> 54:22.759
Perhaps we are being
too hasty.

54:22.842 --> 54:24.177
M'BAKU: Mmm.

54:24.844 --> 54:29.224
She raised a spear against
her own husband for Wakanda.

54:29.391 --> 54:31.935
Where is her
treacherous husband now

54:32.102 --> 54:36.398
but in a place where she can
visit if she wished? Mine...

54:37.691 --> 54:39.567
is with the ancestors.

54:39.651 --> 54:44.447
I am Queen of the most
powerful nation in the world,

54:44.614 --> 54:47.826
and my entire family is gone!

54:48.660 --> 54:51.454
Have I not given everything?

55:00.630 --> 55:02.549
On your feet, General.

55:08.722 --> 55:10.932
I stood by you

55:11.099 --> 55:14.728
after Killmonger
took the throne,

55:14.894 --> 55:18.481
and you and the elders
in this room stood by him

55:18.648 --> 55:22.277
while I ran begging
to the Jabari for protection.

55:23.653 --> 55:25.071
And I warned you

55:25.155 --> 55:28.033
about taking my daughter
on this mission,

55:28.199 --> 55:30.118
and you lost her.

55:30.869 --> 55:32.370
So, today,

55:33.288 --> 55:35.457
I am done.

56:21.544 --> 56:24.089
Are you here, GRIOT?

56:25.423 --> 56:26.674
<i>Yes, my Queen.</i>

56:27.717 --> 56:31.096
Were you with Shuri
when she was abducted?

56:31.262 --> 56:32.555
GRIOT:<i> I was.</i>

56:32.722 --> 56:35.475
Are you able to track
her Kimoyo Beads?

56:35.642 --> 56:38.061
Ballistics found
slugs all over Cambridge.

56:38.144 --> 56:40.230
Those Wakandans really
took a tour of the city.

56:40.313 --> 56:41.314
Hmm.

56:41.398 --> 56:43.149
I can't see how
they figured out who built it.

56:43.233 --> 56:45.652
That information
is highly classified.

56:48.905 --> 56:49.906
What is that?

56:49.989 --> 56:51.408
-That's a new ringtone?
-Oh, shit.

56:52.742 --> 56:54.828
Uh, Director, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to take this.

56:54.911 --> 56:56.121
It's enough
with the titles.

56:56.204 --> 56:57.372
Just take it. I don't care.

56:57.455 --> 56:58.665
Hey, honey sweetheart.

56:58.748 --> 57:00.375
Ooh.

57:00.458 --> 57:03.002
Uh, no, I'm...
I'm with my boss. Now.

57:03.711 --> 57:05.088
Actually, she's leaving.

57:05.255 --> 57:06.256
All right.

57:06.423 --> 57:08.883
I'm gonna work from home,
and then have a shower.

57:16.266 --> 57:17.767
Everett Ross.

57:17.934 --> 57:19.060
Queen Ramonda?

57:19.227 --> 57:21.187
What are you doing
with Shuri's Kimoyo Beads?

57:21.271 --> 57:23.231
I didn't know they were hers.
All right?

57:23.314 --> 57:25.567
I just found them
at a pretty ugly crime scene.

57:26.609 --> 57:27.735
Do you have the student?

57:28.611 --> 57:31.573
Shuri was trying to save her
when they were both taken.

57:32.490 --> 57:33.950
What? Taken by who?

57:35.535 --> 57:37.579
My agency assumes it was you.

57:37.662 --> 57:39.706
And I'm worried
they might be onto the fact

57:39.789 --> 57:42.041
that I pointed Shuri and Okoye
in the right direction.

57:42.208 --> 57:43.918
Look, if they're in danger,
I wanna help.

57:44.002 --> 57:45.920
But I can't if I don't know
what's going on.

57:46.087 --> 57:48.798
I am afraid there is
a new world power at play.

57:49.215 --> 57:51.176
A country
that's already on our radar?

57:51.259 --> 57:52.260
Or you mean someone else?

57:52.343 --> 57:54.345
<i>That is all I can say for now.</i>

57:54.512 --> 57:55.513
Please,

57:55.930 --> 57:58.600
alert me if your government
decides to act

57:58.683 --> 58:00.268
on their suspicions.

58:00.351 --> 58:01.519
Yeah. Sure.

58:02.103 --> 58:06.107
Uh, look, if there's anything
I can do to help, let me know.

58:06.274 --> 58:08.067
I owe Shuri my life.

58:08.818 --> 58:12.739
GRIOT, did Shuri have
her earrings with her?

58:12.906 --> 58:15.450
<i>I lost track of them</i>
<i>in the North Atlantic,</i>

58:15.617 --> 58:18.786
<i>but the people who took her</i>
<i>spoke Yucatec Mayan.</i>

58:28.922 --> 58:30.256
Hello.

58:36.471 --> 58:38.056
You're here for the headmistress?

58:45.230 --> 58:46.231
She's there.

58:47.148 --> 58:48.900
Very good.

58:56.282 --> 58:57.283
Hello.

59:03.456 --> 59:06.960
Please excuse us for a moment.

59:07.043 --> 59:08.920
-Hmm?
-<i>Oui,</i> Miss Nakia.

59:11.381 --> 59:12.423
Hello.

59:12.507 --> 59:13.508
Hello.

59:13.591 --> 59:14.592
Hello.

59:19.389 --> 59:20.640
Queen Mother.

59:22.475 --> 59:24.769
Everything is a lesson here
for the children.

59:24.936 --> 59:27.939
They painted the walls,
they feed the fish,

59:28.106 --> 59:30.400
and they grow
everything we eat here.

59:30.567 --> 59:33.194
I recognize
some of the concepts here.

59:33.361 --> 59:35.321
But you are using
different material.

59:35.488 --> 59:38.825
Yes, we use strictly what
we can find here in Haiti.

59:40.827 --> 59:44.163
You were missed
at T'Challa's funeral.

59:47.292 --> 59:48.293
Oh...

59:55.925 --> 59:57.135
Queen Mother.

59:57.302 --> 1:00:00.263
It's been six years
since you left us.

1:00:00.430 --> 1:00:03.600
I thought you would at least
come back for the ceremony.

1:00:06.352 --> 1:00:07.854
I was afraid

1:00:08.730 --> 1:00:12.525
of how final
the funeral would be.

1:00:12.609 --> 1:00:15.653
Nakia, daughter of Yaa,

1:00:16.946 --> 1:00:20.825
wherever you go,
you are still Wakandan,

1:00:20.992 --> 1:00:24.621
and you know
death is not the end.

1:00:29.709 --> 1:00:31.002
Thank you.

1:00:35.757 --> 1:00:37.508
How is everyone at home?

1:00:37.675 --> 1:00:40.011
Shuri has been taken.

1:00:40.720 --> 1:00:41.721
What?

1:00:42.138 --> 1:00:45.141
You have infiltrated
many nations before.

1:00:45.558 --> 1:00:47.477
That was a long time ago.

1:00:47.560 --> 1:00:48.895
I was a different person then.

1:00:48.978 --> 1:00:52.023
I need someone who can find
where she is being held,

1:00:52.190 --> 1:00:55.234
and rescue her,
without being seen.

1:00:55.610 --> 1:00:58.446
Who on earth would risk war
with Wakanda?

1:01:00.823 --> 1:01:01.908
Oh, my God.

1:01:01.991 --> 1:01:03.284
Okay, breathe. Breathe.

1:01:03.368 --> 1:01:04.827
Oh, don't tell me to breathe.

1:01:04.994 --> 1:01:05.995
Where the hell are we?

1:01:06.162 --> 1:01:08.289
We're in a cave.
I'm not sure where.

1:01:08.373 --> 1:01:09.374
Oh, my God!

1:01:09.916 --> 1:01:11.501
What is that?

1:01:11.668 --> 1:01:14.420
Glow worms.
Their larva gives off light.

1:01:14.504 --> 1:01:16.422
-Just calm down.

1:01:16.839 --> 1:01:18.716
Okay, is there, like,
a new Black Panther

1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:20.051
that you can call
to come and get us?

1:01:20.134 --> 1:01:21.135
No.

1:01:21.219 --> 1:01:22.220
Why not?

1:01:22.303 --> 1:01:24.097
Because it doesn't
work like that anymore.

1:01:24.847 --> 1:01:26.432
The Black Panther is gone.

1:01:27.100 --> 1:01:28.184
So y'all stopped
having Black Panthers

1:01:28.267 --> 1:01:29.268
when I get kidnapped?

1:01:34.774 --> 1:01:35.775
Princess.

1:01:36.943 --> 1:01:39.070
Here royalty wears traditional clothing.

1:01:39.487 --> 1:01:41.656
We had this made for you.

1:01:42.365 --> 1:01:44.534
Do you understand her?

1:01:44.701 --> 1:01:46.202
Not completely.

1:01:48.287 --> 1:01:49.497
Nuh-uh.

1:01:49.664 --> 1:01:51.999
That is some supervillain shit
right there.

1:01:52.166 --> 1:01:53.501
That's in every movie.

1:01:53.668 --> 1:01:54.919
Princess Leia.

1:01:55.086 --> 1:01:56.337
Belle from
<i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

1:01:56.421 --> 1:01:59.048
That white chick
from <i>Indiana Jones.</i>

1:01:59.132 --> 1:02:00.258
It's fine.

1:02:00.341 --> 1:02:02.885
You should see what I have
to wear at Warrior Falls.

1:02:09.308 --> 1:02:10.309
Come with me.

1:02:11.310 --> 1:02:12.729
Wait.

1:02:12.812 --> 1:02:15.273
You're not leaving me in here,
are you?

1:02:15.356 --> 1:02:16.816
I'm coming back.

1:02:17.483 --> 1:02:18.693
I'm coming back.

1:02:18.860 --> 1:02:20.778
Stay calm.

1:02:28.161 --> 1:02:29.245
Eat?

1:02:33.166 --> 1:02:35.168


1:02:43.342 --> 1:02:45.052
Hello Ma'am. It's nice to meet you.

1:02:45.219 --> 1:02:46.262
What can I help you with?

1:02:47.638 --> 1:02:50.349
My name is Maria Aldana.
I'm a student from Merida...

1:02:50.683 --> 1:02:52.393
I'm not interested. Go away. Please.

1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:56.564
Yes, of course. I don't mean
to bother you. Just give me a second...

1:02:57.023 --> 1:02:59.025
My professor mentioned a study

1:02:59.192 --> 1:03:03.738
where you told researchers that
you encountered something...

1:03:04.572 --> 1:03:06.824
Someone unimaginable.

1:03:07.700 --> 1:03:10.244
Nothing good came of speaking
with those outsiders.

1:03:10.411 --> 1:03:11.829
I'm begging you.

1:03:11.996 --> 1:03:13.164
Leave. Now.

1:03:14.832 --> 1:03:17.502
I've encountered him too.

1:03:28.513 --> 1:03:32.433
Sometimes we would catch a
glimpse of a man with winged feet...

1:03:33.684 --> 1:03:35.353
...on the shore of the beach.

1:03:36.103 --> 1:03:37.980
We thought he was a spirit.

1:03:38.856 --> 1:03:40.399
The K'uk'ulkan.

1:03:40.900 --> 1:03:43.361
Our Feathered Serpent God,

1:03:44.153 --> 1:03:47.114
...of this realm and the realm below.

1:03:47.949 --> 1:03:50.618
I would very much like
to visit that beach.

1:03:51.410 --> 1:03:52.662
Be warned...

1:03:53.120 --> 1:03:58.918
K'uk'ulkan has been here for
much longer than you and I.

1:03:59.252 --> 1:04:01.337
Others who have searched for him

1:04:01.587 --> 1:04:03.214
with ill in their hearts...

1:04:03.756 --> 1:04:04.966
have never returned.

1:04:05.883 --> 1:04:07.969
<i>Lost to the depths...</i>

1:04:08.803 --> 1:04:09.804
<i>forever...</i>

1:04:29.824 --> 1:04:31.450
Princess.

1:04:31.617 --> 1:04:32.618
Welcome.

1:04:34.579 --> 1:04:37.039
Please, feel free.

1:04:44.297 --> 1:04:45.590
This is beautiful.

1:04:46.424 --> 1:04:48.175
That was my mother's.

1:04:58.227 --> 1:05:00.771
These are all
Mesoamerican artifacts.

1:05:02.231 --> 1:05:04.108
Most likely 16th century.

1:05:05.318 --> 1:05:07.528
Have you been alive
since then?

1:05:09.488 --> 1:05:11.032
Your mother was human.

1:05:12.491 --> 1:05:13.492
She was.

1:05:13.659 --> 1:05:15.870
Then she became
something else.

1:05:16.037 --> 1:05:18.080
-How?
-"How?"

1:05:18.664 --> 1:05:21.125
"How" is never
as important as "why."

1:05:32.386 --> 1:05:33.846
<i>My mother</i>
<i>and her village</i>

1:05:33.930 --> 1:05:35.514
<i>were driven from their farms</i>

1:05:35.681 --> 1:05:39.435
by Spanish conquistadors
who brought the smallpox,

1:05:39.602 --> 1:05:42.480
a hateful language,
and dogma from another world.

1:05:44.273 --> 1:05:45.983
Facing starvation,

1:05:46.150 --> 1:05:47.985
war, and disease,

1:05:48.444 --> 1:05:50.237
my people turned to Chaac...

1:05:51.906 --> 1:05:53.783
our god of rain and abundance.

1:05:55.993 --> 1:05:58.829
<i>Chaac gave our shaman</i>
<i>a vision...</i>

1:05:58.913 --> 1:06:01.582
<i>-...a way to save his people.</i>

1:06:05.586 --> 1:06:09.966
<i>Chaac led him to a plant</i>
<i>sprouting from a blue rock.</i>

1:06:23.437 --> 1:06:25.648
<i>My mother was pregnant with me</i>
<i>at the time,</i>

1:06:25.815 --> 1:06:28.067
and she did not want to
ingest the plant

1:06:28.234 --> 1:06:30.444
for fear
of what it may do to me.

1:06:30.945 --> 1:06:32.113
No. My baby.

1:06:32.613 --> 1:06:34.490
But the Shaman was convincing.

1:06:43.082 --> 1:06:45.001
Your baby is sick.

1:06:45.584 --> 1:06:47.294
Only this can heal him.

1:06:47.795 --> 1:06:51.424
Your baby will be the first to be born
in our new home.

1:06:53.050 --> 1:06:54.260
Take this gift as a promise...

1:06:54.427 --> 1:06:57.930
He will be our new king.

1:07:06.355 --> 1:07:08.190
<i>They all fell sick.</i>

1:07:09.358 --> 1:07:11.193
<i>And their lives,</i>

1:07:11.360 --> 1:07:13.487
<i>their existence there,</i>

1:07:13.654 --> 1:07:14.947
<i>ended.</i>

1:07:26.834 --> 1:07:29.086
<i>The plant took away</i>
<i>their ability to breathe air</i>

1:07:29.253 --> 1:07:33.049
but enabled them
to draw oxygen from the sea.

1:07:36.385 --> 1:07:38.137
<i>They settled in the ocean,</i>

1:07:38.804 --> 1:07:41.932
away from war and diseases.

1:07:44.518 --> 1:07:45.603
Let's go!

1:08:11.087 --> 1:08:13.255
My mother
gave birth to me there

1:08:13.547 --> 1:08:16.801
<i>and I became</i>
<i>the firstborn son of Talokan.</i>

1:08:17.259 --> 1:08:19.345
<i>The plant gave me wings</i>
<i>on my ankles</i>

1:08:19.512 --> 1:08:21.931
<i>and ears</i>
<i>that pointed to the clouds.</i>

1:08:22.389 --> 1:08:23.641
I was a mutant.

1:08:24.558 --> 1:08:27.812
I could swim in the sky
and age slower.

1:08:27.978 --> 1:08:30.481
Breathe the air
our ancestors breathed.

1:08:31.732 --> 1:08:33.317
<i>As she grew older,</i>

1:08:34.652 --> 1:08:38.239
<i>my mother mourned the life</i>
<i>on land that she once knew...</i>

1:08:40.157 --> 1:08:41.909
and died with a broken heart.

1:08:44.662 --> 1:08:46.288
She made me promise

1:08:46.372 --> 1:08:48.624
to bury her
in the soil of her homeland.

1:08:53.754 --> 1:08:56.674
Nothing could prepare me
for what I found there.

1:09:04.056 --> 1:09:05.141
Whose child is this?

1:09:06.308 --> 1:09:07.309
Huh?

1:09:20.364 --> 1:09:21.782
Shoot!

1:09:21.866 --> 1:09:22.867
Fire!

1:09:39.466 --> 1:09:40.801
Thou art a demon.

1:09:41.594 --> 1:09:42.845
Son of Satan.

1:09:43.012 --> 1:09:45.014
A Spanish man
of faith cursed me.

1:09:45.181 --> 1:09:47.057
As he died by my hand,

1:09:47.224 --> 1:09:48.267
<i>he called me...</i>

1:09:48.475 --> 1:09:49.643
Thou art a child without love.

1:09:50.477 --> 1:09:51.645
The child without love.

1:09:53.689 --> 1:09:55.900
The child without love.

1:09:56.442 --> 1:09:57.902
And I took my name from there.

1:10:03.282 --> 1:10:04.992
<i>"Namor."</i>

1:10:05.159 --> 1:10:07.995
<i>Because I have no love</i>
<i>for the surface world.</i>

1:10:09.997 --> 1:10:12.082
Why are you telling me
all of this?

1:10:13.500 --> 1:10:16.629
So that you can understand why
I have to kill the scientist.

1:10:16.795 --> 1:10:18.380
What if we took her
to Wakanda?

1:10:19.757 --> 1:10:20.966
Let us go.

1:10:21.926 --> 1:10:23.385
I give you my word.

1:10:23.552 --> 1:10:25.012
She will remain in my country.

1:10:25.221 --> 1:10:26.680
I cannot risk that, Princess.

1:10:26.847 --> 1:10:28.474
Then keep me instead.

1:10:30.434 --> 1:10:32.061
I'd love to see your nation.

1:10:33.395 --> 1:10:36.023
Well, you can't go
down there in that.

1:10:38.067 --> 1:10:41.528
Hypothermia will grip you
almost instantaneously.

1:10:41.695 --> 1:10:43.948
Your blood will become toxic

1:10:44.031 --> 1:10:45.449
and the pressure of the ocean

1:10:45.532 --> 1:10:47.952
will break every bone
in your body.

1:10:51.038 --> 1:10:52.289
Or you can wear a suit.

1:10:52.706 --> 1:10:54.458
We have some of them. Come on.

1:10:57.544 --> 1:10:58.545
Stay close.

1:12:02.901 --> 1:12:04.570
<i>Hey! Namor, wait!</i>

1:12:49.615 --> 1:12:50.741
<i>Whoa!</i>

1:14:08.152 --> 1:14:09.611
<i>Hello.</i>

1:14:38.182 --> 1:14:39.308
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

1:14:41.143 --> 1:14:42.478
<i>It's made of vibranium.</i>

1:14:42.644 --> 1:14:43.645
Yes.

1:14:43.729 --> 1:14:45.314
In the depths of the ocean,

1:14:45.731 --> 1:14:47.983
I brought the sun
to my people.

1:14:50.068 --> 1:14:51.195
I know you wished me

1:14:51.278 --> 1:14:53.530
to spare the life
of the scientist.

1:14:53.906 --> 1:14:56.158
But now you see
what I have to protect.

1:15:20.974 --> 1:15:23.060
<i>Nakia,</i>
<i>your hunch was correct.</i>

1:15:23.227 --> 1:15:26.230
<i>I have picked up a location</i>
<i>on Shuri's Kimoyo earrings.</i>

1:15:59.596 --> 1:16:02.224
GRIOT:<i> The signal is coming</i>
<i>from an underwater cavern</i>

1:16:02.391 --> 1:16:05.852
<i>approximately 140 meters</i>
<i>below the surface.</i>

1:16:06.478 --> 1:16:08.772
Queen Mother,
I've found her signal.

1:16:08.939 --> 1:16:11.066
It's coming
from an underwater cave.

1:16:12.067 --> 1:16:13.068
If she's down there,

1:16:13.151 --> 1:16:14.778
I'm sure
I'll encounter resistance.

1:16:15.737 --> 1:16:17.656
<i>How would you like me</i>
<i>to proceed?</i>

1:16:18.574 --> 1:16:22.953
Retrieve the princess
by any means necessary.

1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:26.331
I will attempt
to draw Namor out.

1:17:01.241 --> 1:17:02.909
You are the first person
from the surface

1:17:02.993 --> 1:17:04.494
to come to Talokan.

1:17:05.495 --> 1:17:07.539
Please take this as a token
of our gratitude.

1:17:14.713 --> 1:17:17.299
It was made with the plant
that saved Talokan.

1:17:20.093 --> 1:17:21.470
You are young, Princess.

1:17:22.346 --> 1:17:25.265
When you age as I do,
you realize

1:17:25.432 --> 1:17:28.185
we all lose everyone we love.

1:17:28.352 --> 1:17:29.936
But when I lost my brother,

1:17:30.103 --> 1:17:31.730
it just felt different.

1:17:31.897 --> 1:17:33.565
He suffered in silence.

1:17:34.149 --> 1:17:37.152
When he finally asked me
to help him, I couldn't.

1:17:38.236 --> 1:17:39.946
How does that make sense

1:17:40.906 --> 1:17:44.576
that the ancestors would
give me gifts and skills

1:17:44.743 --> 1:17:47.496
to help me save my brother,
and I couldn't?

1:17:48.997 --> 1:17:49.998
Why?

1:17:52.459 --> 1:17:54.961
I don't have an answer
for that question.

1:17:57.089 --> 1:17:59.633
My ancestors would often say,

1:18:00.008 --> 1:18:03.428
"Only the most broken people
can be great leaders."

1:18:07.182 --> 1:18:09.351
I admire
what you have built here.

1:18:11.645 --> 1:18:14.106
And how you've protected
your people.

1:18:14.898 --> 1:18:17.943
But as princess of Wakanda,

1:18:18.110 --> 1:18:20.570
I will not stand for you
killing that young woman.

1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:25.367
My nation will not rest
until I'm returned.

1:18:26.785 --> 1:18:28.912
I'm not leaving without her.

1:18:29.663 --> 1:18:33.375
We need to find a peaceful way
to resolve this.

1:18:37.045 --> 1:18:38.755
It is no longer
about the scientist.

1:18:40.841 --> 1:18:42.467
For centuries,
the surface nations

1:18:42.551 --> 1:18:45.345
have conquered and enslaved
people like us.

1:18:46.012 --> 1:18:47.472
Over resources.

1:18:48.890 --> 1:18:51.143
Since the day
I buried my mother,

1:18:51.309 --> 1:18:52.936
I have prepared my people

1:18:53.019 --> 1:18:55.147
for the time
they will come for us.

1:18:55.313 --> 1:18:59.526
And that machine is the sign
that the time is now.

1:19:01.403 --> 1:19:06.742
I need to know if Wakanda
is an ally or an enemy.

1:19:07.159 --> 1:19:09.035
There is no in-between.

1:19:11.163 --> 1:19:14.875
So you plan to wage war
on the entire world,

1:19:15.459 --> 1:19:17.794
and you want Wakanda
to help you?

1:19:18.712 --> 1:19:19.880
That's madness.

1:19:20.046 --> 1:19:23.049
There isn't a nation
that wouldn't plunder Wakanda

1:19:23.133 --> 1:19:24.676
if given a chance.

1:19:26.011 --> 1:19:27.929
If we make an alliance,

1:19:28.096 --> 1:19:30.807
we can protect each other
by striking them first.

1:19:31.349 --> 1:19:35.604
Then, when the threat of these
nations has been eliminated,

1:19:35.771 --> 1:19:38.398
the scientist will be returned
to Wakanda.

1:19:38.815 --> 1:19:41.610
And if Wakanda
does not accept, what then?

1:19:42.694 --> 1:19:44.654
The scientist will die.

1:19:45.655 --> 1:19:48.575
And Wakanda will be
the first nation to fall.

1:19:48.825 --> 1:19:50.368
An attack on my people?

1:19:50.702 --> 1:19:52.162
Yes.

1:19:52.329 --> 1:19:54.706
And I want you
to listen to me.

1:19:54.873 --> 1:19:57.834
Wakanda cannot win a war
with Talokan.

1:20:01.922 --> 1:20:04.049
You have been summoned...

1:20:04.216 --> 1:20:05.425
K'uk'ulkan.

1:20:09.679 --> 1:20:11.890
I heard you that night,

1:20:11.973 --> 1:20:13.975
with your mother at the river.

1:20:15.268 --> 1:20:18.021
You said you wanted
to burn the world.

1:20:24.194 --> 1:20:25.695
Let us burn it together.

1:20:34.329 --> 1:20:35.497
US SECRETARY OF STATE:
Queen Ramonda

1:20:35.580 --> 1:20:37.249
won't sell us any vibranium.

1:20:37.999 --> 1:20:39.543
And now they abducted
a young woman

1:20:39.626 --> 1:20:40.877
who built the machine.

1:20:41.044 --> 1:20:42.337
Yeah, with all due respect,

1:20:42.420 --> 1:20:44.047
Riri Williams
is a child prodigy

1:20:44.130 --> 1:20:46.341
who was running circles around
all of her professors.

1:20:46.508 --> 1:20:47.968
The Wakandans
were recruiting her

1:20:48.051 --> 1:20:49.386
as part of their
outreach program.

1:20:49.553 --> 1:20:50.971
Nothing more. And then,

1:20:51.137 --> 1:20:53.515
you guys send in a SWAT team
under cover of night

1:20:53.682 --> 1:20:55.684
to arrest the Crown Princess

1:20:55.767 --> 1:20:57.102
of an international
superpower.

1:21:00.272 --> 1:21:01.940
The President wants
to take offensive action

1:21:02.023 --> 1:21:03.066
against Wakanda.

1:21:04.484 --> 1:21:06.361
What type of offensive action?

1:21:07.070 --> 1:21:08.613
Destabilization.

1:21:09.781 --> 1:21:13.118
Well, Special Officer Ross
is our expert.

1:21:13.285 --> 1:21:15.495
So, Ross, what do you think?

1:21:15.662 --> 1:21:17.163
My sources are telling me

1:21:17.247 --> 1:21:18.456
that there's someone else
out there.

1:21:19.374 --> 1:21:21.293
-Another nation?
-Could be. I don't know.

1:21:21.376 --> 1:21:22.377
You've gotta give me
enough time

1:21:22.460 --> 1:21:23.545
to investigate this properly,

1:21:23.628 --> 1:21:25.755
otherwise we're gonna
find ourselves at war

1:21:25.922 --> 1:21:27.757
with a country
whose military capacity

1:21:27.841 --> 1:21:29.801
we can't even comprehend.

1:21:31.386 --> 1:21:32.387
Director?

1:21:32.846 --> 1:21:35.098
I think he's the expert.

1:21:35.181 --> 1:21:38.184
I think it would be a mistake
to attack Wakanda.

1:21:44.983 --> 1:21:46.067
<i>Yes?</i>

1:21:46.151 --> 1:21:47.152
We have a problem.

1:22:08.632 --> 1:22:10.967
Is my daughter alive?

1:22:11.134 --> 1:22:13.094
The princess
is alive and well.

1:22:13.803 --> 1:22:16.640
She requested
to be taken to Talokan.

1:22:16.806 --> 1:22:19.184
She will remain there
for the time being.

1:22:22.812 --> 1:22:26.066
What can I offer you
in exchange?

1:22:26.483 --> 1:22:27.484
Nothing.

1:22:27.943 --> 1:22:29.653
I beg to differ.

1:22:29.819 --> 1:22:33.490
The Americans are preparing
to blame Wakanda

1:22:33.573 --> 1:22:36.117
for your attack
on their mining ship.

1:22:36.284 --> 1:22:39.245
Return my daughter
and the scientist

1:22:39.412 --> 1:22:42.999
or I will inform them
of your existence.

1:22:49.714 --> 1:22:51.841
If you tell the Americans
about us,

1:22:53.343 --> 1:22:55.512
if you try to find us,

1:22:56.596 --> 1:23:00.392
or if I discover a single
Wakandan ship in the ocean,

1:23:01.184 --> 1:23:02.644
I will kill the princess.

1:23:04.187 --> 1:23:05.981
I will come to Wakanda

1:23:06.147 --> 1:23:08.108
and I will kill you.

1:23:17.450 --> 1:23:18.493
So, what happened?

1:23:20.370 --> 1:23:23.373
He wants to go to war
with the surface world,

1:23:23.540 --> 1:23:25.333
and asked me to help him.

1:23:29.838 --> 1:23:31.256
I need to think.

1:23:32.132 --> 1:23:34.092
We ain't never
gettin' out of here.

1:23:43.143 --> 1:23:44.144
Ey!

1:23:46.354 --> 1:23:47.689
Drop your spear!

1:23:47.772 --> 1:23:49.315
Kill the Princess!

1:23:55.405 --> 1:23:56.740
Drop your knife.

1:23:57.323 --> 1:23:58.408
You...

1:23:58.992 --> 1:24:00.118
You killed her.

1:24:00.994 --> 1:24:02.287
Let her go

1:24:02.495 --> 1:24:04.456
and you don't have to die.

1:24:07.542 --> 1:24:08.543
Shuri...

1:24:09.461 --> 1:24:11.046
Move your left arm.

1:24:15.675 --> 1:24:16.801
Are you okay?

1:24:17.594 --> 1:24:18.970
Are you okay?

1:24:19.220 --> 1:24:20.472
-Give me your Beads!
-Let's go.

1:24:20.638 --> 1:24:22.015
Give me your Beads.
I can save her.

1:24:22.098 --> 1:24:23.099
We have to go.

1:24:23.266 --> 1:24:24.392
Shuri, I don't know
who this lady is,

1:24:24.476 --> 1:24:25.560
but we need to listen to her.

1:24:25.727 --> 1:24:26.895
Listen, I hit her
with a sonic round.

1:24:27.062 --> 1:24:29.314
It is lethal from this distance.
There is no chance.

1:24:29.397 --> 1:24:31.274
You don't understand.
This will mean war.

1:24:31.441 --> 1:24:33.777
-We have to go.
-Wait!

1:25:17.403 --> 1:25:18.404
Did they hurt you?

1:25:18.488 --> 1:25:20.115
No. No.

1:25:21.658 --> 1:25:22.867
Thank you.

1:25:23.618 --> 1:25:24.869
You're welcome.

1:25:26.371 --> 1:25:27.580
-GRIOT.
-<i> Yes, my Queen.</i>

1:25:27.664 --> 1:25:29.707
Return us to Wakanda at once.

1:25:33.545 --> 1:25:35.380
What happened my child?

1:25:37.340 --> 1:25:39.175
The Wakandans.

1:25:39.968 --> 1:25:41.761
They came for her.

1:25:44.389 --> 1:25:46.432
K'uk'ulkan...

1:25:48.935 --> 1:25:52.397
can you save me?

1:26:05.743 --> 1:26:07.120
Is she dead?

1:26:09.497 --> 1:26:10.582
Yes.

1:26:19.257 --> 1:26:21.593
Rest child.

1:26:24.137 --> 1:26:25.555
They came...

1:26:26.014 --> 1:26:29.976
while you spoke to the Queen?

1:26:31.394 --> 1:26:34.814
We should not have trusted her.

1:26:35.523 --> 1:26:38.526
The Princess has seen our home.

1:26:38.985 --> 1:26:41.196
What is stopping them

1:26:41.613 --> 1:26:43.740
from coming for Talokan?

1:26:45.992 --> 1:26:47.285
I will.

1:27:22.153 --> 1:27:23.613
Rise Talokan!

1:27:26.115 --> 1:27:27.742
Rise Talokan!

1:27:33.039 --> 1:27:35.083
I was blinded

1:27:35.291 --> 1:27:36.626
by hope

1:27:36.793 --> 1:27:38.503
of partnership.

1:27:40.421 --> 1:27:41.422
And...

1:27:42.048 --> 1:27:44.300
I have compromised

1:27:44.884 --> 1:27:47.011
all of us.

1:27:47.804 --> 1:27:48.930
Talokan

1:27:49.347 --> 1:27:50.807
will not move

1:27:50.974 --> 1:27:52.392
again.

1:27:53.476 --> 1:27:54.477
Namora.

1:27:55.728 --> 1:27:56.896
Attuma.

1:27:58.481 --> 1:28:01.484
When we are done with them

1:28:04.404 --> 1:28:06.739
they will never think

1:28:06.906 --> 1:28:08.950
of approaching

1:28:09.117 --> 1:28:10.576
Talokan!

1:28:12.954 --> 1:28:14.289
Rise Talokan!

1:28:17.041 --> 1:28:18.376
Rise Talokan!

1:28:26.634 --> 1:28:29.137
Princess,
it is good to have you back.

1:28:29.345 --> 1:28:31.389
The city has been on edge
since you left.

1:28:32.307 --> 1:28:33.308
Go.

1:28:33.474 --> 1:28:36.060
Fortify the sonic barriers
for all waterways.

1:28:36.227 --> 1:28:37.228
Princess?

1:28:38.146 --> 1:28:39.147
Neka.

1:28:41.107 --> 1:28:43.484
Thank the ancestors. Hmm?

1:28:43.818 --> 1:28:47.030
I just wanted to return these.

1:28:48.239 --> 1:28:50.408
No. Keep them.

1:28:50.575 --> 1:28:52.076
Might need them soon.

1:28:52.994 --> 1:28:54.996
Did you get that
from down there?

1:28:57.957 --> 1:29:01.336
Is it true you saw
an underwater empire?

1:29:02.587 --> 1:29:04.339
-Yes.
-Hmm.

1:29:05.006 --> 1:29:06.591
It is beautiful.

1:29:07.842 --> 1:29:10.470
But these people
are dangerous, Aneka.

1:29:10.970 --> 1:29:12.013
Mm.

1:29:30.656 --> 1:29:33.451
So,
Miss Riri Williams,

1:29:34.202 --> 1:29:36.371
what do you think of Wakanda?

1:29:36.537 --> 1:29:38.539
The stories just don't do
this place justice.

1:29:41.667 --> 1:29:42.710
It's great.

1:29:42.877 --> 1:29:44.629
But I really
would like to go home.

1:29:46.089 --> 1:29:47.673
You will need to be patient.

1:29:47.840 --> 1:29:49.884
Can I at least call my mom?

1:29:56.307 --> 1:29:57.725
The Princess
has been brought home

1:29:57.809 --> 1:29:59.602
by the War Dog Nakia.

1:29:59.769 --> 1:30:01.145
Glory to Hanuman.

1:30:01.229 --> 1:30:02.688
Glory to Hanuman.

1:30:02.772 --> 1:30:07.318
Mm. The spy saves Wakanda
once again.

1:30:07.902 --> 1:30:09.362
The Queen will reward her

1:30:09.529 --> 1:30:12.031
with lifetime banishment.
I'm sure of it.

1:30:14.492 --> 1:30:15.952
Okoye.

1:30:18.413 --> 1:30:19.414
Thank you, my sister.

1:30:21.582 --> 1:30:22.834
<i>After Thanos' attack,</i>

1:30:23.292 --> 1:30:25.420
when you left
without saying a word,

1:30:26.045 --> 1:30:27.213
it hurt.

1:30:31.175 --> 1:30:34.595
I regret not being there
with all of you.

1:30:36.097 --> 1:30:37.390
It was not easy.

1:30:38.182 --> 1:30:39.183
He was...

1:30:39.851 --> 1:30:43.688
King and Black Panther
to everyone.

1:30:44.355 --> 1:30:46.524
But to me...

1:30:52.280 --> 1:30:53.990
he was everything.

1:30:55.867 --> 1:30:57.827
My T'Challa.

1:30:59.162 --> 1:31:02.123
When he was taken away
from me, just like that, I...

1:31:02.874 --> 1:31:04.750
I had to step away

1:31:05.668 --> 1:31:07.295
and let myself break.

1:31:09.964 --> 1:31:11.174
I couldn't just...

1:31:12.133 --> 1:31:15.511
keep going as if nothing
had happened, you know.

1:31:16.345 --> 1:31:18.306
Mm-hmm.

1:31:33.321 --> 1:31:34.322
We are under attack.

1:31:42.205 --> 1:31:43.289
Here.

1:31:50.129 --> 1:31:51.130
Take this one.

1:31:51.964 --> 1:31:53.633
Are you okay?
Are you all right?

1:31:53.716 --> 1:31:55.593
GRIOT, activate the <i>Sunbird.</i>

1:31:55.760 --> 1:31:56.928
Shuri, where are you?

1:31:57.094 --> 1:31:58.554
Making my way
to the city right now.

1:31:58.721 --> 1:32:00.181
Stand down! That is an order!

1:32:00.348 --> 1:32:02.642
Mother, I'm with Aneka.
We can provide air support.

1:32:02.808 --> 1:32:04.185
<i> Aneka,</i>
<i>do not let her leave the lab.</i>

1:32:04.268 --> 1:32:05.353
Mother, you're...
you're breaking up.

1:32:05.436 --> 1:32:06.437
-We can't hear you.
-RAMONDA:<i> Shuri!</i>

1:32:06.521 --> 1:32:07.522
Love you. Bye!

1:32:09.857 --> 1:32:10.942
You just hung up on the Queen.

1:32:11.108 --> 1:32:12.109
I just hung up on my mom.

1:32:12.276 --> 1:32:13.861
There's a difference.
Come. Let's go!

1:32:46.102 --> 1:32:48.187
Invaders!

1:32:53.776 --> 1:32:56.988
-Mama! Mama!

1:32:59.907 --> 1:33:01.450
Let us turn! Turn around!

1:33:05.413 --> 1:33:06.414
<i>EMTs are suffering</i>

1:33:06.497 --> 1:33:08.291
<i>a form of sonic hypnosis.</i>

1:33:11.002 --> 1:33:12.128
Take the child.

1:33:12.295 --> 1:33:14.130
<i>General, plug your ears.</i>

1:33:14.297 --> 1:33:15.381
Yes, my Queen.

1:34:01.802 --> 1:34:03.929
-Can I help?
-Come, quickly.

1:34:10.853 --> 1:34:12.396
Warrior!

1:34:14.523 --> 1:34:15.608
Cross your arms...

1:34:15.816 --> 1:34:16.942
...my child.

1:34:21.364 --> 1:34:22.365
Nakia.

1:34:22.448 --> 1:34:23.699
Yes.

1:34:23.783 --> 1:34:25.159
We'll find your mama, OK?

1:34:36.754 --> 1:34:38.047
The fish man.

1:34:42.343 --> 1:34:45.012
The defenses have been lured
away from the palace.

1:34:45.304 --> 1:34:47.348
It is up to you now.

1:35:13.165 --> 1:35:14.166
<i>Phambili!</i>

1:36:06.510 --> 1:36:07.970
Mayday!

1:36:08.053 --> 1:36:09.054
Mayday!

1:36:26.405 --> 1:36:27.448
Shit, he's too fast.

1:36:27.531 --> 1:36:28.532
He's even faster in the water.

1:36:54.433 --> 1:36:55.935
-Activating system override.
-No.

1:36:56.018 --> 1:36:57.019
-Wait! I'll fix it.

1:36:57.102 --> 1:36:58.687
-Can't leave you here, Shuri!

1:37:15.496 --> 1:37:16.497
Do you see her?

1:37:16.580 --> 1:37:17.957
Yes. Right there.

1:37:31.470 --> 1:37:33.138
-Go, child.

1:37:33.931 --> 1:37:35.474
Wait, what?
And leave you here?

1:37:35.558 --> 1:37:36.559
Run!

1:37:51.240 --> 1:37:52.700
Okoye, move now!

1:38:53.510 --> 1:38:54.929
Help the child.

1:39:00.434 --> 1:39:01.518
She did this.

1:39:05.564 --> 1:39:06.732
In one week's time,

1:39:06.815 --> 1:39:09.485
I will return
with my entire army

1:39:09.652 --> 1:39:12.905
and you will join us
against the surface world,

1:39:13.072 --> 1:39:16.033
or I will wash Wakanda
from the face of the Earth.

1:39:16.992 --> 1:39:18.035
Come on, my Queen.

1:39:18.994 --> 1:39:19.995
Mother.

1:39:20.454 --> 1:39:22.164
-Keep her back!
-Mother!

1:39:22.498 --> 1:39:25.209
-Mama! Mama!
-Bury your dead.

1:39:25.960 --> 1:39:27.503
Mourn your losses.

1:39:30.839 --> 1:39:32.424
You are queen now.

1:39:32.675 --> 1:39:33.676
Mother!

1:39:34.385 --> 1:39:35.386
No!

1:39:38.555 --> 1:39:40.099
Get off of me!
Mother!

1:39:40.849 --> 1:39:42.726
Mama!

1:39:49.566 --> 1:39:51.610
Mama!

1:39:51.694 --> 1:39:53.112
Mama!

1:39:53.696 --> 1:39:54.863
Mother!

1:39:55.447 --> 1:39:56.699
Wake up, my Queen.

1:39:58.617 --> 1:39:59.743
Let me see.

1:40:00.369 --> 1:40:01.370
Wake up.

1:40:02.413 --> 1:40:03.747
Help me!

1:40:03.914 --> 1:40:05.207
Mama!

1:40:08.711 --> 1:40:09.878
Wake up, Mother.

1:40:10.546 --> 1:40:11.755
She has passed.

1:40:12.715 --> 1:40:14.842
-Mama!

1:40:55.549 --> 1:41:00.721
Jabariland offers you
their comfort for your loss.

1:41:07.352 --> 1:41:09.021
You must mourn her

1:41:09.188 --> 1:41:13.108
in accordance to the rituals
of your ancestors.

1:41:15.069 --> 1:41:16.904
Do not bury yourself
in your technology.

1:41:17.071 --> 1:41:18.322
Why are you here?

1:41:20.199 --> 1:41:21.909
I promised your brother

1:41:22.076 --> 1:41:24.369
that I would provide you
with counsel

1:41:24.536 --> 1:41:25.954
and protection.

1:41:28.415 --> 1:41:30.626
But I am in need
of your advice today.

1:41:34.463 --> 1:41:36.215
Your tribal elders
have approached me

1:41:36.298 --> 1:41:38.092
with a proposition.

1:41:39.510 --> 1:41:42.763
They wish to evacuate the city
and set up camp

1:41:42.930 --> 1:41:44.431
in Jabariland.

1:41:44.598 --> 1:41:47.768
So, now you are keen
to hear from a child

1:41:48.435 --> 1:41:50.104
who scoffs at tradition?

1:41:51.105 --> 1:41:52.147
M'BAKU: Mm.

1:41:54.316 --> 1:41:55.317
The world...

1:41:57.236 --> 1:41:59.905
The world has taken
too much from you

1:42:00.656 --> 1:42:03.909
for you to still be
considered a child.

1:42:07.037 --> 1:42:08.956
It is in my people's interest
to know

1:42:09.039 --> 1:42:11.500
which way your mind
is leaning.

1:42:13.377 --> 1:42:15.087
The elders are desperate.

1:42:16.713 --> 1:42:18.632
The city is vulnerable.

1:42:20.843 --> 1:42:23.011
If you are to provide
for them,

1:42:24.138 --> 1:42:26.390
they will be
in great debt to you.

1:42:28.475 --> 1:42:30.185
And what of your heart?

1:42:31.311 --> 1:42:32.312
Hmm?

1:42:33.730 --> 1:42:35.732
Which way
is your heart leaning?

1:42:37.609 --> 1:42:40.571
I just buried the last person
who truly knew me.

1:42:44.074 --> 1:42:45.742
My heart was buried with her.

1:43:21.862 --> 1:43:23.739
Oh, man.

1:43:24.615 --> 1:43:26.533
Yeah, your olive oil's
about to go bad.

1:43:26.700 --> 1:43:27.701
What...
What are you doing here?

1:43:27.868 --> 1:43:30.537
I'm hungry. And...

1:43:30.954 --> 1:43:32.956
<i>Tragedy strikes</i>
<i>the international community.</i>

1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:34.208
<i>Sources can now confirm</i>

1:43:34.291 --> 1:43:37.252
<i>that Queen Ramonda,</i>
<i>daughter of Lumumba, has died.</i>

1:43:37.878 --> 1:43:39.463
<i>Western allies say</i>
<i>that civil conflict</i>

1:43:39.546 --> 1:43:41.590
<i>was the likely cause</i>
<i>of the Queen's...</i>

1:43:44.134 --> 1:43:45.135
So...

1:43:45.510 --> 1:43:46.845
You have any comment?

1:43:49.014 --> 1:43:52.184
I wonder what else your
friends are keeping from you.

1:43:52.392 --> 1:43:54.019
What are you talking about?

1:43:54.186 --> 1:43:57.689
I have no unsanctioned contact
with the kingdom of Wakanda.

1:44:00.108 --> 1:44:02.277
What about the Beads?

1:44:02.569 --> 1:44:04.571
What?

1:44:04.738 --> 1:44:05.739
The Beads.

1:44:05.906 --> 1:44:07.032
I had them bugged

1:44:07.199 --> 1:44:08.867
before you
ever even got there.

1:44:09.034 --> 1:44:12.871
I've been privy to every
conversation you've had,

1:44:12.955 --> 1:44:15.624
including that treasonous call
with the Queen.

1:44:15.791 --> 1:44:17.167
May she rest in peace.

1:44:17.584 --> 1:44:18.877
But it's good.

1:44:19.044 --> 1:44:20.087
Well, for us.

1:44:20.254 --> 1:44:22.965
All right. You know what?
The Wakandans saved my life.

1:44:23.465 --> 1:44:25.092
-They're a good people.
-Mm-hmm.

1:44:25.175 --> 1:44:27.219
You ever thought
for a second

1:44:27.386 --> 1:44:29.012
what they could be doing?

1:44:29.179 --> 1:44:30.597
Ever thought
what we would be doing

1:44:30.681 --> 1:44:33.892
if the US was the only country
in the world with vibranium?

1:44:34.142 --> 1:44:38.438
Oh, I actually dream
about that.

1:44:41.275 --> 1:44:42.943
Val. Val, please.

1:44:43.318 --> 1:44:45.112
It's Director de Fontaine.

1:44:47.823 --> 1:44:50.993
Your mother protected me
like I was one of her own.

1:44:52.286 --> 1:44:54.746
The least that I could do
is try to return the favor.

1:44:57.082 --> 1:44:59.459
We need to find a way
to weaken Namor.

1:44:59.626 --> 1:45:01.795
Even weakened,
he's still gonna be a problem.

1:45:01.962 --> 1:45:05.382
The Black Panther has never
failed to protect Wakanda.

1:45:06.133 --> 1:45:08.135
I thought
the Black Panther was gone.

1:45:17.853 --> 1:45:19.187
My brother is dead.

1:45:20.939 --> 1:45:23.525
But it doesn't mean
the Black Panther is gone.

1:45:41.293 --> 1:45:42.836
GRIOT?

1:45:43.003 --> 1:45:45.630
Let's start by running
a comparative analysis

1:45:45.797 --> 1:45:47.591
between our attempts
at creating

1:45:47.674 --> 1:45:49.384
a synthetic
Heart-Shaped Herb...

1:45:52.095 --> 1:45:54.056
and the fibers
from this bracelet.

1:45:54.639 --> 1:45:55.932
<i>Yes, Princess.</i>

1:45:59.227 --> 1:46:01.980
Since this was grown
from vibranium-rich soil,

1:46:03.231 --> 1:46:05.484
they may share
some base-level similarities

1:46:05.567 --> 1:46:06.693
that we can exploit.

1:46:06.860 --> 1:46:08.153
<i>As you wish, Princess.</i>

1:46:12.449 --> 1:46:14.868
Please upload
my brother's DNA also.

1:46:15.035 --> 1:46:16.161
<i>Uploading now.</i>

1:46:32.761 --> 1:46:34.888
<i>Who do I turn to</i>

1:46:35.514 --> 1:46:37.140
<i>When I need saving</i>

1:46:37.808 --> 1:46:39.976
<i>'Cause you move mountain</i>

1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:42.396
<i>I can't do the same</i>

1:46:43.230 --> 1:46:44.731
<i>And did you think about</i>

1:46:46.441 --> 1:46:47.651
<i>When you left us</i>

1:46:47.734 --> 1:46:49.069
Why doesn't he look like them?

1:46:49.236 --> 1:46:51.446
His physiology
is completely different.

1:46:51.613 --> 1:46:54.282
None of them fly
or have pointed ears like him.

1:46:54.783 --> 1:46:55.784
The women
that were guarding us,

1:46:55.867 --> 1:46:56.868
they had water
over their mouths

1:46:56.952 --> 1:46:58.662
and on their necks.

1:46:58.745 --> 1:46:59.746
He didn't have that.

1:46:59.913 --> 1:47:02.332
Several organisms
don't need gills

1:47:02.416 --> 1:47:05.335
to extract oxygen
from the water, so...

1:47:05.502 --> 1:47:07.045
It's like a jellyfish.

1:47:07.212 --> 1:47:11.007
He just absorbs the oxygen
from his skin.

1:47:12.342 --> 1:47:13.343
It's a process called

1:47:13.427 --> 1:47:14.636
-diffusion.
-Diffusion.

1:47:16.930 --> 1:47:21.435
<i>Memories, oh, carry me go</i>

1:47:22.269 --> 1:47:25.897
<i>Carry me go, oh, nowhere</i>

1:47:26.356 --> 1:47:29.901
<i>Sick and tired of it all</i>
<i>Take me far-away</i>

1:47:29.985 --> 1:47:32.279
<i>Mr Dj Gbemi trabaye</i>

1:47:32.362 --> 1:47:35.031
<i>Now I no fit trust anybody</i>

1:47:35.115 --> 1:47:36.867
<i>Na e make I no fit shout</i>

1:47:36.950 --> 1:47:38.869
<i>My body don dey tire eh</i>

1:47:38.952 --> 1:47:41.746
Every day that passes
without selecting the ruler

1:47:41.913 --> 1:47:43.290
is a day wasted.

1:47:43.457 --> 1:47:45.041
We must deal with Namor

1:47:45.125 --> 1:47:46.877
before he brings
his warriors back here.

1:47:47.043 --> 1:47:49.713
And how are we to deal with
a man with that much power?

1:47:50.589 --> 1:47:52.382
In that attack,
before he took out your plane,

1:47:52.466 --> 1:47:53.717
he jumped back into the water.

1:47:53.884 --> 1:47:55.635
What if that's what
makes him strong?

1:47:55.802 --> 1:47:57.721
He's breathing air
and getting oxygen

1:47:57.804 --> 1:47:59.347
from the water on his skin.

1:47:59.514 --> 1:48:01.558
If we could find a way
to dry his ass out,

1:48:01.641 --> 1:48:02.767
he won't be as strong.

1:48:03.101 --> 1:48:04.352
Yo, that's it.

1:48:04.436 --> 1:48:07.647
GRIOT. We need to convert
the Royal Talon Fighter

1:48:07.731 --> 1:48:09.274
into a pervaporation chamber.

1:48:09.441 --> 1:48:10.525
Is that even possible?

1:48:10.692 --> 1:48:11.860
Yes.

1:48:13.361 --> 1:48:15.280
You're going to help us
trap him.

1:48:16.114 --> 1:48:18.116
Please show Miss Williams
where she's working.

1:48:18.283 --> 1:48:19.826
Right this way.

1:48:23.663 --> 1:48:24.664
<i>How old were you</i>

1:48:24.748 --> 1:48:26.166
<i>when you built</i>
<i>your first machine?</i>

1:48:26.333 --> 1:48:27.417
<i>Three.</i>

1:48:27.584 --> 1:48:31.046
<i>My stepdad was a car mechanic.</i>
<i>He wanted to build airplanes.</i>

1:48:31.213 --> 1:48:33.673
<i>He gave me these tools</i>
<i>and let me just work it out.</i>

1:48:37.594 --> 1:48:39.888
<i>So who taught you</i>
<i>how to do all that you do?</i>

1:48:40.222 --> 1:48:41.473
SHURI:<i> My big brother.</i>

1:48:44.518 --> 1:48:47.854
I was the tip of
the spear of Wakanda's army.

1:48:48.021 --> 1:48:50.440
This is not me.

1:48:50.941 --> 1:48:53.109
Besides, I'm a civilian now.

1:48:54.194 --> 1:48:55.570
I turned in my weapon.

1:48:56.196 --> 1:48:57.864
I built you
a new spear as well.

1:48:59.741 --> 1:49:00.742
A new one?

1:49:00.909 --> 1:49:01.952
Yes.

1:49:03.286 --> 1:49:05.664
What is this contraption's
name anyway?

1:49:05.830 --> 1:49:07.290
The Midnight Angel.

1:49:07.457 --> 1:49:08.917
Midnight Angel?

1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:10.752
Listen to me.

1:49:11.836 --> 1:49:14.047
This will even
the odds against them.

1:49:14.214 --> 1:49:16.675
Sister, I need you to
be ready when I call you.

1:49:18.510 --> 1:49:19.719
Please.

1:49:19.803 --> 1:49:22.347
<i>My body don dey tire eh</i>

1:49:22.430 --> 1:49:24.224
<i>Make me mara eh</i>

1:49:24.307 --> 1:49:25.517
Shuri.

1:49:26.184 --> 1:49:27.352
Yes.

1:49:28.979 --> 1:49:30.564
How many of these
did you make?

1:49:32.691 --> 1:49:34.651
I looked for you
at the Jabari outpost.

1:49:34.818 --> 1:49:36.486
I won't be forced out
of my home.

1:49:36.653 --> 1:49:39.197
You have such
a rebellious spirit.

1:49:39.281 --> 1:49:40.740
Why did you join the Dora?

1:49:41.783 --> 1:49:42.951
Why do you care?

1:49:43.243 --> 1:49:45.996
<i>As far as I can see</i>
<i>Na the memories</i>

1:49:46.079 --> 1:49:48.623
<i>Wey Dey carry me</i>
<i>From reality</i>

1:49:48.707 --> 1:49:50.125
<i>E no require visa</i>

1:49:50.208 --> 1:49:52.711
I still have a lot of fight
left in me.

1:49:53.211 --> 1:49:56.339
Tell me, Aneka,
daughter of Kyana,

1:49:57.007 --> 1:49:59.217
do you still have
some fight left in you?

1:49:59.384 --> 1:50:01.803
What do you have in mind?

1:50:02.512 --> 1:50:05.348
<i>My body don dey tire eh</i>

1:50:13.732 --> 1:50:15.775
<i>My body don dey tire eh</i>

1:50:15.859 --> 1:50:18.361
<i>Make me mara eh</i>

1:50:18.445 --> 1:50:20.947
<i>When my whole world</i>
<i>is set on fire</i>

1:50:21.031 --> 1:50:23.825
<i>Don't leave me alone</i>

1:50:26.453 --> 1:50:27.454
GRIOT,

1:50:28.997 --> 1:50:30.457
what's the confidence rate?

1:50:31.082 --> 1:50:33.376
<i>98.7%, Princess.</i>

1:50:33.752 --> 1:50:36.421
<i>Would you like me to print</i>
<i>the Heart-Shaped Herb?</i>

1:50:40.467 --> 1:50:42.969
Hey, Shuri.

1:50:43.720 --> 1:50:46.014
Thought
you'd be back in Haiti by now.

1:50:47.140 --> 1:50:48.683
I'm still Wakandan, you know.

1:50:52.729 --> 1:50:53.730
So...

1:50:55.023 --> 1:50:57.984
this is what
you've been up to.

1:50:58.777 --> 1:50:59.944
Yes.

1:51:00.111 --> 1:51:02.030
What you have here, now,

1:51:03.281 --> 1:51:07.494
is a chance to restore
Wakanda's protector.

1:51:07.577 --> 1:51:12.999
It would be the greatest gift

1:51:13.458 --> 1:51:15.794
since Bashenga's discovery.

1:51:20.924 --> 1:51:23.176
We'll soon find out. Come.

1:51:26.304 --> 1:51:27.764
-GRIOT?
-GRIOT:<i> Yes, Princess.</i>

1:51:27.847 --> 1:51:28.932
Print it.

1:51:33.103 --> 1:51:34.813
How will we know
if it works?

1:51:35.605 --> 1:51:36.856
If it glows.

1:51:45.990 --> 1:51:47.158
You did it!

1:51:51.913 --> 1:51:52.997
I mean,
shouldn't we be

1:51:53.081 --> 1:51:54.374
burning incense or something?

1:51:54.999 --> 1:51:56.084
Only Bast knows

1:51:56.167 --> 1:51:58.169
how the ancestors
will make it to this lab.

1:52:08.513 --> 1:52:10.348
Are you sure you don't want me
to bury you?

1:52:10.515 --> 1:52:11.516
No.

1:52:12.100 --> 1:52:14.144
Need you to have access
to my chest,

1:52:14.310 --> 1:52:16.354
just in case
I go through cardiac arrest.

1:52:16.938 --> 1:52:18.481
"Cardiac arrest"?

1:52:19.566 --> 1:52:20.608
She's joking,

1:52:21.151 --> 1:52:22.402
right?

1:52:23.570 --> 1:52:25.405
-Right?

1:52:30.368 --> 1:52:34.205
Allow this Heart-Shaped Herb

1:52:34.581 --> 1:52:37.625
to give you the strength
of the Black Panther

1:52:38.042 --> 1:52:40.462
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.

1:52:42.964 --> 1:52:44.340
Ramonda.

1:52:44.716 --> 1:52:49.012
We beg of you, come to your daughter.

1:53:59.749 --> 1:54:00.750
Mother?

1:54:14.097 --> 1:54:15.348
N'Jadaka.

1:54:15.932 --> 1:54:17.100
Lil' cousin.

1:54:17.475 --> 1:54:18.476
How?

1:54:18.560 --> 1:54:21.396
How is never as important
as why, right?

1:54:23.189 --> 1:54:24.440
You chose me.

1:54:24.607 --> 1:54:27.485
Impossible.
I would never choose you.

1:54:27.652 --> 1:54:29.320
Why did you take the Herb?

1:54:30.321 --> 1:54:32.282
-To see my family.
-No, that's bullshit.

1:54:33.241 --> 1:54:35.159
You didn't believe
the Ancestral Plane was real,

1:54:35.243 --> 1:54:36.244
did you?

1:54:39.372 --> 1:54:40.373
No.

1:54:41.124 --> 1:54:42.375
So, why did you take it, then?

1:54:44.085 --> 1:54:45.461
You don't have to lie to me.

1:54:46.296 --> 1:54:47.797
So I can be strong.

1:54:48.172 --> 1:54:49.674
Strong to do what?

1:54:52.552 --> 1:54:53.553
See?

1:54:55.096 --> 1:54:57.056
We're more alike
than you think.

1:54:58.975 --> 1:55:00.935
I took it to avenge
my ancestors too.

1:55:01.102 --> 1:55:02.270
I'm nothing like you.

1:55:03.730 --> 1:55:05.481
You took it for yourself,

1:55:05.648 --> 1:55:07.191
then destroyed the rest.

1:55:08.693 --> 1:55:09.903
Unworthy king,

1:55:10.737 --> 1:55:12.238
afraid of being replaced.

1:55:13.323 --> 1:55:14.324
Just a coward.

1:55:14.490 --> 1:55:15.491
No.

1:55:15.575 --> 1:55:16.618
I had the courage to do

1:55:16.701 --> 1:55:18.244
what was necessary
to change Wakanda.

1:55:19.662 --> 1:55:21.164
How many people
like your scientist

1:55:21.247 --> 1:55:23.625
did Wakanda protect
before I took the throne?

1:55:24.667 --> 1:55:25.668
Cowards.

1:55:25.835 --> 1:55:28.087
That was the Panthers
that came before me,

1:55:29.172 --> 1:55:30.173
and before T'Challa.

1:55:30.256 --> 1:55:32.091
Don't mention my brother.

1:55:32.425 --> 1:55:34.093
You're the reason
why he's dead.

1:55:34.594 --> 1:55:37.847
You burnt the Herb,
left us with no protector.

1:55:38.014 --> 1:55:40.266
Then Namor struck
and killed my mother.

1:55:40.433 --> 1:55:42.268
Their blood is on your hands.

1:55:43.436 --> 1:55:44.771
That ain't on me.

1:55:45.313 --> 1:55:46.689
And don't you dare

1:55:46.856 --> 1:55:48.691
take that away
from your mother.

1:55:48.858 --> 1:55:50.443
She sacrificed her life
to protect

1:55:50.526 --> 1:55:52.362
a young girl
from the lost tribe.

1:55:53.738 --> 1:55:56.407
Your father,
he was a hypocrite.

1:55:57.909 --> 1:55:59.661
He would've killed that girl.

1:56:00.370 --> 1:56:02.288
Shit, he killed
his own brother.

1:56:03.873 --> 1:56:06.542
T'Challa was too noble.

1:56:08.711 --> 1:56:11.047
He let the man
who murdered your father live.

1:56:13.174 --> 1:56:14.842
And here you stand.

1:56:20.515 --> 1:56:22.642
Are you gonna be noble
like your brother

1:56:22.809 --> 1:56:24.894
or take care of business...

1:56:25.603 --> 1:56:26.729
like me?

1:56:29.565 --> 1:56:30.566
Are you okay?

1:56:32.735 --> 1:56:33.903
Are you OK?

1:56:36.447 --> 1:56:37.532
Who did you see?

1:56:43.037 --> 1:56:44.038
No one.

1:56:47.291 --> 1:56:48.292
What's going on?

1:56:48.918 --> 1:56:50.336
I failed.

1:56:50.503 --> 1:56:52.630
-It didn't work.
-Hey, Shuri.

1:56:55.758 --> 1:56:58.136
-They abandoned me.
-They would never do that.

1:56:58.219 --> 1:56:59.762
I did everything
I was supposed to do.

1:56:59.846 --> 1:57:01.681
-I re-created the Herb.
-Okay.

1:57:01.764 --> 1:57:03.808
I just did your stupid ritual,
and for what?

1:57:03.975 --> 1:57:05.518
-Relax.
-Why didn't they come for me?

1:57:05.601 --> 1:57:06.728
Just relax.

1:57:13.818 --> 1:57:15.111
Shit.

1:57:19.449 --> 1:57:20.783
Can I get some of that too?

1:57:28.207 --> 1:57:29.250
I think...

1:57:30.793 --> 1:57:32.253
you're going to need a suit.

1:58:03.868 --> 1:58:05.870
There are more
people coming from the city.

1:58:05.953 --> 1:58:07.580
M'BAKU: They need more space.

1:58:07.747 --> 1:58:08.748
So what?

1:58:09.624 --> 1:58:11.876
You are visitors.

1:58:12.043 --> 1:58:15.254
It is a wonder how anything
gets done with you people.

1:58:40.404 --> 1:58:42.698
-The princess!

1:59:16.232 --> 1:59:17.525
M'BAKU: She has done it!

1:59:18.234 --> 1:59:21.237
-The Black Panther lives!

1:59:39.088 --> 1:59:41.507
Namor believes
Wakanda is on her knees.

1:59:43.968 --> 1:59:45.428
Our Queen murdered.

1:59:47.930 --> 1:59:49.473
Our capital destroyed.

1:59:51.142 --> 1:59:52.977
He believes
we have no protector.

1:59:54.979 --> 1:59:55.980
But now...

1:59:57.773 --> 1:59:59.775
now is our time to strike.

1:59:59.942 --> 2:00:03.529
How, when we don't
even know how to find him?

2:00:04.113 --> 2:00:05.823
We'll bring Namor to us.

2:00:05.990 --> 2:00:07.533
-Here, again?
-No.

2:00:07.700 --> 2:00:10.036
A distant location at sea.

2:00:10.203 --> 2:00:11.621
M'BAKU: All right.

2:00:11.704 --> 2:00:13.164
Let's say this does work.

2:00:14.457 --> 2:00:17.210
Hmm. Assuming
we can kill this man

2:00:17.376 --> 2:00:20.421
who can fly and is potentially
as strong as the Hulk...

2:00:23.174 --> 2:00:25.593
is murdering him
the right solution?

2:00:26.052 --> 2:00:28.012
TRIBE ELDER 2:
You were calling for his head

2:00:28.179 --> 2:00:30.514
when his only crime
was intimidation.

2:00:30.681 --> 2:00:32.475
What has changed, Lord M'Baku?

2:00:32.642 --> 2:00:33.851
His soldiers

2:00:34.018 --> 2:00:35.728
did not call him
General or King.

2:00:35.811 --> 2:00:38.481
They called him K'uk'ulkan.

2:00:38.648 --> 2:00:39.857
What is that?

2:00:40.024 --> 2:00:42.151
The feather serpent god.

2:00:42.735 --> 2:00:43.736
What?

2:00:43.819 --> 2:00:45.821
Do you think because we are
living in the mountains,

2:00:45.988 --> 2:00:47.865
we do not have access
to books?

2:00:48.115 --> 2:00:49.617
-Elders,

2:00:50.034 --> 2:00:51.410
with your permission,

2:00:51.577 --> 2:00:55.289
I would like to talk
with Lord M'Baku alone.

2:00:56.666 --> 2:00:57.875
Yes.

2:00:57.959 --> 2:00:58.960
Yes.

2:01:05.424 --> 2:01:06.759
Namor's not finished.

2:01:08.177 --> 2:01:11.264
He promised to destroy
the surface world.

2:01:11.430 --> 2:01:13.766
Now is our opportunity
to take him.

2:01:13.933 --> 2:01:16.185
-What are you afraid of?
-M'BAKU: War.

2:01:16.602 --> 2:01:19.939
If Namor is indeed
a god to his people,

2:01:20.106 --> 2:01:22.733
killing him
will risk eternal war.

2:01:22.817 --> 2:01:23.985
And so what?

2:01:24.527 --> 2:01:26.862
Was my mother's life
not worth eternal war?

2:01:27.029 --> 2:01:28.406
M'BAKU: Of course it was.

2:01:29.407 --> 2:01:33.494
Of course she was.

2:01:35.496 --> 2:01:38.708
But it is not what she would
have wanted for you.

2:01:39.959 --> 2:01:40.960
Hmm?

2:01:44.171 --> 2:01:45.881
And it is not what I want...

2:01:48.509 --> 2:01:50.261
for my people.

2:02:00.604 --> 2:02:03.649
You speak of my mother
as if she's still here.

2:02:04.567 --> 2:02:06.569
Of what she would've
wanted for me.

2:02:07.653 --> 2:02:09.947
Her hopes and her dreams.

2:02:13.117 --> 2:02:14.618
But she's dead.

2:02:15.661 --> 2:02:16.662
She's gone!

2:02:18.372 --> 2:02:22.251
Namor drowned her,
right in front of me!

2:02:23.669 --> 2:02:24.962
So, her dreams,

2:02:25.129 --> 2:02:28.215
her goals, her hopes for me...

2:02:31.552 --> 2:02:32.803
it doesn't exist.

2:02:35.514 --> 2:02:37.058
It doesn't matter anymore.

2:02:39.143 --> 2:02:42.021
What matters is what I want,

2:02:42.188 --> 2:02:44.899
and what I want is Namor dead!

2:02:48.903 --> 2:02:50.571
And you're going
to help me get it.

2:02:58.120 --> 2:02:59.288
Are we clear?

2:03:06.837 --> 2:03:08.464
We leave in the morning.

2:03:34.281 --> 2:03:35.282
Hi.

2:03:35.449 --> 2:03:36.450
Good morning.

2:03:39.078 --> 2:03:40.287
If we survive this,

2:03:41.956 --> 2:03:45.167
I want you to know you have
a home with me in Haiti.

2:03:48.003 --> 2:03:50.339
Here. Take my hands.

2:03:53.634 --> 2:03:54.635
Breathe.

2:03:59.014 --> 2:04:01.517
Shuri, I want you
to be honest with me.

2:04:01.684 --> 2:04:04.728
Who did you see
when you took the Herb?

2:04:09.900 --> 2:04:11.610
If you go to war
for vengeance,

2:04:11.694 --> 2:04:14.196
it will not fill the hole
left from her loss.

2:04:14.780 --> 2:04:16.657
It will only grow larger,

2:04:16.824 --> 2:04:18.284
and it will consume you.

2:04:20.536 --> 2:04:21.912
It already has.

2:04:27.293 --> 2:04:34.049
K'uk'ulkan, another machine to
detect vibranium is in use in the ocean.

2:04:35.050 --> 2:04:36.093
Where?

2:04:36.177 --> 2:04:38.387


2:05:05.456 --> 2:05:06.624
Get out of the water!

2:05:51.293 --> 2:05:52.586
For the Queen.

2:06:26.078 --> 2:06:27.496
<i>Phambili!</i>

2:07:06.660 --> 2:07:08.412
<i>Riri,</i>
<i>how's it going up there?</i>

2:07:08.912 --> 2:07:10.164
<i>Hey, Mr. GRIOT.</i>

2:07:10.247 --> 2:07:11.707
I could really use
that backup right now.

2:07:11.874 --> 2:07:13.834
<i>I thought</i>
<i>you'd never ask.</i>

2:07:19.632 --> 2:07:20.633
<i>Shit.</i>

2:07:25.095 --> 2:07:26.472
<i>Shit, he's fast.</i>

2:07:27.139 --> 2:07:28.349
<i>But I'm faster.</i>

2:07:33.979 --> 2:07:35.564
Whoo!

2:07:48.327 --> 2:07:49.370
<i>I got you.</i>

2:07:55.709 --> 2:07:57.044
<i>It's on you now, Shuri.</i>

2:08:06.220 --> 2:08:07.596
-Princess.
-SHURI:<i> No.</i>

2:08:08.097 --> 2:08:11.600
I am the Black Panther,
and I'm here for retribution!

2:08:12.267 --> 2:08:15.270
<i>Pervaporation cells</i>
<i>activated.</i>

2:08:24.697 --> 2:08:25.698
What's wrong?

2:08:26.448 --> 2:08:27.741
You need a glass of water?

2:08:31.745 --> 2:08:33.455
-Yo, we got him.
-Good!

2:08:33.539 --> 2:08:34.832
Namor has been captured.

2:08:34.915 --> 2:08:36.083
Retreat back!

2:08:40.963 --> 2:08:42.464
Back to Wakanda!

2:08:48.178 --> 2:08:49.179
Move out!

2:09:14.246 --> 2:09:16.165
-What is going on?

2:09:16.248 --> 2:09:18.125
The sonic emitter
has been destroyed.

2:09:40.355 --> 2:09:41.857
That can't be good.

2:10:13.972 --> 2:10:16.141
GRIOT:<i> Panther, the</i>
Sea Leopard<i> has lost power,</i>

2:10:16.225 --> 2:10:18.268
<i>and they are experiencing</i>
<i>significant casualties.</i>

2:10:19.812 --> 2:10:20.813
Okoye.

2:10:20.979 --> 2:10:22.231
OKOYE:<i> Panther.</i>

2:10:22.356 --> 2:10:23.357
<i>Phambili!</i>

2:10:23.440 --> 2:10:24.441
Aneka.

2:10:24.525 --> 2:10:25.609
Yes!

2:10:25.692 --> 2:10:26.693
Okoye!

2:10:26.777 --> 2:10:28.153
It is time.

2:10:32.741 --> 2:10:34.117
Phambili!

2:10:39.039 --> 2:10:40.082
For Wakanda!

2:10:40.791 --> 2:10:42.000
ANEKA:<i> Wakanda!</i>

2:10:50.342 --> 2:10:51.885
GRIOT, what's the damage?

2:10:51.969 --> 2:10:52.970
GRIOT:<i> Catastrophic.</i>

2:10:53.053 --> 2:10:54.429
<i>His spear is made</i>
<i>of raw vibranium.</i>

2:10:54.513 --> 2:10:55.931
<i>The ship could explode</i>
<i>at any second.</i>

2:10:56.014 --> 2:10:57.015
Get us to the desert.

2:11:15.826 --> 2:11:17.119
-<i>No!</i>

2:11:45.439 --> 2:11:46.982
Sink the ship!

2:12:14.551 --> 2:12:15.552
I got you, sis.

2:12:15.636 --> 2:12:16.720
<i>Hold on.</i>

2:13:21.034 --> 2:13:22.369
Warrior!

2:13:25.831 --> 2:13:28.125
You speak the mother tongue?

2:13:28.417 --> 2:13:30.794
You can greet your ancestors with it...

2:14:00.907 --> 2:14:02.117
<i>Get off me!</i>

2:14:14.171 --> 2:14:15.380
<i>All right, come here.</i>

2:14:18.675 --> 2:14:21.553
You will greet your ancestors.

2:14:45.994 --> 2:14:47.746
M'BAKU:
May the ancestors save us

2:14:47.829 --> 2:14:49.456
if the princess
does not hurry.

2:14:49.539 --> 2:14:51.249
We may be going to join them.

2:14:52.167 --> 2:14:53.251
If so, hey,

2:14:53.418 --> 2:14:55.670
let us take as many of them
with us as we can.

2:15:25.784 --> 2:15:27.202
It could've been different.

2:15:31.790 --> 2:15:33.250
I need water.

2:15:49.891 --> 2:15:51.184
<i>Are you gonna be noble</i>

2:15:51.268 --> 2:15:52.269
<i>like your brother</i>

2:15:52.352 --> 2:15:53.687
<i>or take care of business</i>

2:15:53.854 --> 2:15:54.896
like me?

2:15:55.063 --> 2:15:56.606
I'm not my brother.

2:15:58.024 --> 2:16:00.026
Namor will beg me for mercy

2:16:00.694 --> 2:16:03.238
as I stand and watch
as he dies.

2:16:42.152 --> 2:16:44.529
Imperius Rex.

2:16:46.698 --> 2:16:48.408
-Wakanda forever!

2:18:37.058 --> 2:18:38.560
Shuri.

2:18:40.103 --> 2:18:41.104
Mama.

2:18:44.065 --> 2:18:45.358
Show him

2:18:45.734 --> 2:18:47.277
who you are.

2:18:54.117 --> 2:18:55.118
Yield,

2:18:56.328 --> 2:18:58.663
and Wakanda
will protect your oceans.

2:18:58.830 --> 2:19:01.082
We will protect your secrets.

2:19:01.249 --> 2:19:02.250
Yield,

2:19:03.501 --> 2:19:05.211
and your people will live.

2:19:09.299 --> 2:19:11.634
Vengeance has consumed us.

2:19:12.093 --> 2:19:14.721
We cannot let it
consume our people.

2:19:23.521 --> 2:19:25.273
I yield.

2:19:50.256 --> 2:19:52.425
Talokanile'ex!

2:19:54.344 --> 2:19:55.887
Let us return home.

2:19:56.429 --> 2:19:57.847
Our fight here is done.

2:20:10.735 --> 2:20:12.612
Wakanda forever!

2:20:13.071 --> 2:20:14.656
Wakanda forever!

2:20:38.888 --> 2:20:40.515
<i>Oou le le oou le le oou le le</i>

2:20:43.893 --> 2:20:46.104
<i>-Oou le le</i>

2:20:50.066 --> 2:20:52.694
<i>Oou le le oou le le oou le le</i>

2:20:52.777 --> 2:20:57.198
<i>Oou oou</i>
<i>le le oou le le oou le oou le</i>

2:20:57.282 --> 2:20:58.950
<i>Well, I pray that the universe</i>

2:20:59.033 --> 2:21:00.535
Thank you, my love.

2:21:02.245 --> 2:21:04.914
<i>Gives you way more</i>
<i>than you deserve</i>

2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:09.586
<i>When the tears fall</i>
<i>like shooting stars</i>

2:21:10.003 --> 2:21:11.838
<i>Remember who you are</i>

2:21:12.547 --> 2:21:16.384
<i>Just look up to the sky</i>
<i>You'll see</i>

2:21:16.468 --> 2:21:19.262
<i>Well, I pray that the universe</i>

2:21:21.431 --> 2:21:24.267
<i>Gives you way more</i>
<i>than you deserve</i>

2:21:24.350 --> 2:21:25.518
Yo.

2:21:29.022 --> 2:21:31.149
-All set to head home?

2:21:31.232 --> 2:21:32.317
As long as you're sure
the police

2:21:32.400 --> 2:21:33.860
won't be waiting for me
at the airport.

2:21:34.027 --> 2:21:35.653
Don't worry.
Took care of that.

2:21:35.820 --> 2:21:37.113
But you might
want to slow down

2:21:37.197 --> 2:21:39.449
on your
homework-for-hire business.

2:21:39.532 --> 2:21:41.910
Get caught slipping,
I can't help you with that.

2:21:43.203 --> 2:21:45.038
They said you wanted
to talk to me about something?

2:21:45.205 --> 2:21:46.206
Yes.

2:21:46.539 --> 2:21:49.751
Your suit.
It's a great design,

2:21:50.293 --> 2:21:51.544
but can't let you
leave with it.

2:21:51.711 --> 2:21:52.921
It's all good.

2:21:53.004 --> 2:21:54.297
Figured the least I could do

2:21:54.380 --> 2:21:56.049
is help Wakanda
clean up my mess.

2:21:57.300 --> 2:21:58.801
I have one more thing
to show you.

2:21:59.219 --> 2:22:00.220
Come.

2:22:04.224 --> 2:22:07.310
Took me a while to find
all the parts from the river,

2:22:07.477 --> 2:22:08.853
but it was worth it.

2:22:09.521 --> 2:22:10.522
How did you...

2:22:11.856 --> 2:22:13.399
It's my dad's car.

2:22:14.651 --> 2:22:16.361
We used to
work on it before...

2:22:16.444 --> 2:22:19.030
<i>Oou le le oou le le oou le le</i>

2:22:19.113 --> 2:22:21.199
<i>I'm coming back for you</i>

2:22:22.325 --> 2:22:24.202
-You sure this is her?
-Every part.

2:22:24.369 --> 2:22:25.828
Have it shipped to Boston.

2:22:25.995 --> 2:22:27.288
Be there before you arrive.

2:22:32.835 --> 2:22:33.836
Bring it in, man.

2:22:37.423 --> 2:22:41.719
<i>Panther, Miss Williams'</i>
<i>transport has arrived.</i>

2:22:42.345 --> 2:22:43.888
Look after yourself.

2:22:44.222 --> 2:22:46.641
Sure you're not trying
to slide to Chicago?

2:22:46.808 --> 2:22:47.892
Catch a Bulls game?

2:22:49.143 --> 2:22:50.687
Sounds fun,

2:22:50.770 --> 2:22:53.606
but I have something
I need to take care of.

2:23:18.339 --> 2:23:20.800
And now I present to you

2:23:20.967 --> 2:23:22.135
Princess Shuri,

2:23:22.302 --> 2:23:23.595
the Black Panther!

2:23:42.071 --> 2:23:44.907
The Black Panther
sends her regards,

2:23:45.700 --> 2:23:47.702
but she will not be
joining us today.

2:23:48.828 --> 2:23:50.788
I, M'Baku,

2:23:50.955 --> 2:23:53.499
leader of the Jabari Tribe,

2:23:53.666 --> 2:23:55.126
son of Wakanda,

2:23:56.628 --> 2:23:58.379
wish to challenge

2:23:59.464 --> 2:24:00.840
for the throne.

2:24:06.304 --> 2:24:07.972
What is troubling you, my child?

2:24:09.849 --> 2:24:16.856
I looked forward to fighting
alongside you my entire life...

2:24:17.815 --> 2:24:22.904
The thought of you
kneeling to the Wakandans...

2:24:23.279 --> 2:24:28.117
The Black Panther
had every reason to kill me.

2:24:28.951 --> 2:24:32.080
Why do you think
she didn't go through with it?

2:24:33.915 --> 2:24:38.419
The Black Panther
is the most powerful person

2:24:38.795 --> 2:24:44.509
in the most powerful nation
on the surface.

2:24:44.759 --> 2:24:47.762
But she has no allies.

2:24:48.137 --> 2:24:52.725
Now she has empathy
for the people of Talokan.

2:24:54.560 --> 2:24:56.646
With this alliance...

2:24:57.355 --> 2:25:04.362
Talokan will be stronger than ever.

2:25:04.821 --> 2:25:08.700
The surface world will come for Wakanda

2:25:09.534 --> 2:25:12.412
and Wakanda will turn to us.

2:25:14.080 --> 2:25:15.707
Trust me.

2:25:32.432 --> 2:25:33.766
What the hell is this?

2:25:33.850 --> 2:25:36.269
-Can we turn around?

2:25:36.686 --> 2:25:38.646
I don't know, man.
We'll lose an hour.

2:25:40.064 --> 2:25:41.482
Why don't you go check it out?

2:25:41.566 --> 2:25:42.859
Okay.

2:25:45.653 --> 2:25:46.946
Yeah,
this is Shauver.

2:25:47.363 --> 2:25:49.365
Yeah, looks like we got
a tree blocking our way.

2:25:49.532 --> 2:25:51.242
How do you want us to proceed?

2:25:51.325 --> 2:25:52.785
-What the...

2:26:03.421 --> 2:26:04.714
Ah!

2:26:04.797 --> 2:26:07.133
A colonizer in chains.

2:26:07.800 --> 2:26:09.844
Now I have seen everything.

2:26:09.927 --> 2:26:11.053
Funny.

2:26:11.804 --> 2:26:12.805
Let's go.

2:26:35.787 --> 2:26:36.788
<i>Merci.</i>

2:26:39.999 --> 2:26:41.000
Thank you.

2:26:41.083 --> 2:26:42.126
You're welcome.

2:26:46.714 --> 2:26:47.715
Hey.

2:26:49.050 --> 2:26:50.593
Welcome!

2:26:52.386 --> 2:26:53.805
It's good to see you.

2:26:54.555 --> 2:26:55.765
Everything is ready.

2:26:55.932 --> 2:26:57.308
Just give me one moment, eh?

2:26:57.475 --> 2:26:58.810
Actually,

2:26:58.976 --> 2:27:00.853
I think I should do it
on my own.

2:27:02.063 --> 2:27:03.439
Of course.

2:28:56.636 --> 2:29:00.056
<i>Lift me up</i>

2:29:02.016 --> 2:29:05.436
<i>Hold me down</i>

2:29:07.396 --> 2:29:11.609
<i>Keep me close</i>

2:29:12.818 --> 2:29:16.197
<i>Safe and sound</i>

2:29:18.282 --> 2:29:23.037
<i>Burning in a hopeless dream</i>

2:29:23.537 --> 2:29:29.001
<i>Hold me when you go to sleep</i>

2:29:29.085 --> 2:29:32.672
<i>Keep me in the warmth</i>
<i>of your love</i>

2:29:32.755 --> 2:29:35.925
<i>When you depart keep me safe</i>

2:29:36.008 --> 2:29:38.135
<i>Safe and sound</i>

2:29:39.887 --> 2:29:43.224
<i>Lift me up</i>

2:29:45.184 --> 2:29:48.938
<i>Hold me down</i>

2:29:50.606 --> 2:29:54.527
<i>Keep me close</i>

2:29:56.028 --> 2:29:59.407
<i>Safe and sound</i>

2:30:01.367 --> 2:30:06.288
<i>Drowning in an endless sea</i>

2:30:06.622 --> 2:30:11.836
<i>Take some time</i>
<i>and stay with me</i>

2:30:12.169 --> 2:30:16.507
<i>Keep me in the strength</i>
<i>of your arms</i>

2:30:16.590 --> 2:30:19.176
<i>Keep me safe</i>

2:30:19.260 --> 2:30:21.429
<i>Safe and sound</i>

2:30:23.055 --> 2:30:26.684
<i>Lift me up</i>

2:30:28.561 --> 2:30:32.273
<i>Hold me down</i>

2:30:33.816 --> 2:30:37.987
<i>Keep me safe</i>

2:30:39.113 --> 2:30:42.283
<i>Safe and sound</i>

2:30:44.660 --> 2:30:49.957
<i>Burning in a hopeless dream</i>

2:30:50.041 --> 2:30:55.171
<i>Hold me when you go to sleep</i>

2:30:55.254 --> 2:30:59.383
<i>Keep me safe</i>

2:30:59.467 --> 2:31:04.305
<i>We need light</i>
<i>We need love</i>

2:31:06.307 --> 2:31:09.435
<i>-Lift me up</i>
<i>-Lift me up</i>

2:31:09.518 --> 2:31:11.771
<i>In your arms</i>

2:31:11.854 --> 2:31:14.982
<i>-Hold me down</i>
<i>-I need love, I need love</i>

2:31:15.066 --> 2:31:17.151
<i>I need love</i>

2:31:17.234 --> 2:31:22.198
<i>-Keep me safe</i>
<i>-Hold me</i>

2:31:22.281 --> 2:31:25.785
<i>We need light</i>
<i>We need love</i>

2:31:38.464 --> 2:31:39.465
Shuri,

2:31:40.800 --> 2:31:42.510
can we join you now?

2:31:45.596 --> 2:31:48.641
This is my son, Toussaint.

2:31:49.809 --> 2:31:50.810
Toussaint,

2:31:51.477 --> 2:31:54.605
this is your aunty, Shuri.

2:31:56.023 --> 2:31:57.024
Hi.

2:32:17.962 --> 2:32:20.631
We agreed it was better
for him to grow up here.

2:32:20.798 --> 2:32:23.884
Away from the pressure
of the throne.

2:32:25.261 --> 2:32:26.470
Your father,

2:32:27.096 --> 2:32:28.848
your <i>baba,</i>

2:32:29.014 --> 2:32:31.684
prepared us for his death,
didn't he?

2:32:36.355 --> 2:32:38.399
But he didn't want us
to go to the funeral

2:32:39.233 --> 2:32:42.153
because he felt the time
was not yet right.

2:32:42.862 --> 2:32:45.656
So we had our own ceremony
for him here.

2:32:47.408 --> 2:32:48.993
Did my mother meet him?

2:32:49.076 --> 2:32:50.077
She did.

2:32:59.670 --> 2:33:00.796
It's nice to meet you.

2:33:00.880 --> 2:33:02.173
Nice to meet you.

2:33:02.339 --> 2:33:03.883
Toussaint is a beautiful name.

2:33:04.383 --> 2:33:06.510
It holds a great history.

2:33:06.677 --> 2:33:09.972
Thanks. Yours is cool, too,
I guess.

2:33:13.267 --> 2:33:15.436
My mom says you are good
at keeping secrets.

2:33:15.519 --> 2:33:16.520
Is that true?

2:33:17.771 --> 2:33:20.566
Yes, I can keep a good secret.

2:33:23.569 --> 2:33:25.863
Toussaint is my Haitian name.

2:33:28.824 --> 2:33:29.992
Who are you?

2:33:30.910 --> 2:33:33.120
My name is Prince T'Challa,

2:33:33.204 --> 2:33:35.122
son of King T'Challa.
