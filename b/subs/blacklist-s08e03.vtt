00:01.001 --> 00:02.961
[narrator] <i>Previously on</i> The Blacklist:

00:03.044 --> 00:06.297
[Raymond] I knew her as Katarina Rostova,
one of her many names.

00:06.381 --> 00:08.800
[Dom] People were looking for your mother.

00:08.883 --> 00:09.968
She was being hunted.

00:10.051 --> 00:12.554
[Dom] And she knew she needed
to disappear, to fade away.

00:12.637 --> 00:14.180
[Raymond] As I feared would happen,

00:14.264 --> 00:19.352
elements from Katarina's past are circling
Elizabeth like wolves in the night.

00:19.436 --> 00:23.940
I'm not sure Elizabeth will ever be ready
to learn about what you did to Katarina.

00:24.023 --> 00:26.609
[Raymond] I need to control
the danger to Elizabeth.

00:26.693 --> 00:31.614
I've built a vast criminal network
predicated on that very principle.

00:31.698 --> 00:32.532
Katarina.

00:33.366 --> 00:36.119
-I've always helped you.
-You were never on my side.

00:38.246 --> 00:41.166
-I'm your mother.
-A mother protects her children.

00:41.249 --> 00:45.003
I did protect you by hiding you.
I didn't want you to be hunted.

00:45.086 --> 00:46.254
I love you, Masha.

00:46.337 --> 00:49.591
-[Raymond] You can't trust that woman.
-That woman is my mother.

00:49.674 --> 00:52.093
Oh, she's just using that to exploit you.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.137
If you hurt her, we're done.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.062
[dramatic music playing]

01:02.437 --> 01:05.940
Whatever happened, it's over.
No sign of Reddington or Keen.

01:06.024 --> 01:08.109
[Park] No blood or spent shell casings.

01:08.193 --> 01:09.944
<i>We can get a forensic team.</i>

01:10.028 --> 01:12.363
Do it, but my guess is,
we won't find anything.

01:12.447 --> 01:15.241
Reddington probably had
his cleaners on standby.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.410
He didn't kill her. He wouldn't.

01:18.328 --> 01:23.875
I mean, uh, it is Mr. Reddington,
but, guys, still, it's Liz's mother.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.173
[Cooper] <i>Agent Ressler,</i>
<i>any word from Keen?</i>

01:30.256 --> 01:32.967
[Ressler] <i>Nothing. When she called</i>
<i>to tell me about Reddington,</i>

01:33.051 --> 01:36.387
it was on Dembe's cell.
If she still has it, she's not answering.

01:36.471 --> 01:37.430
What about her phone?

01:38.181 --> 01:39.349
[Ressler] <i>She doesn't have it.</i>

01:39.432 --> 01:41.935
<i>Reddington took it</i>
<i>and her weapon when they grabbed us.</i>

01:42.018 --> 01:45.480
Get to her apartment.
Agent Mojtabai, call Agnes's school.

01:45.563 --> 01:47.690
Find out whether Keen picked her up.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.984
[recording] <i>You have reached</i>
<i>the voicemail box of...</i>

01:50.068 --> 01:51.611
-[Liz] <i>Elizabeth Keen.</i>
-[phone beeps]

01:52.237 --> 01:54.614
[woman] <i>Hey, Liz, it's Merritt.</i>
<i>I got your message.</i>

01:54.697 --> 01:57.742
<i>Yes, of course. Agnes can always</i>
<i>come home with us after school.</i>

01:57.826 --> 02:00.787
<i>I'm sure Kelly will be thrilled.</i>
<i>Hope work goes well.</i>

02:00.870 --> 02:02.163
[recording] <i>Next message.</i>

02:02.247 --> 02:03.373
[Ressler] <i>Keen, it's me.</i>

02:03.456 --> 02:06.084
<i>We need to talk. Look, I'm not mad, okay?</i>

02:06.167 --> 02:09.379
<i>But I'm worried about you.</i>
<i>Call me when you get this.</i>

02:09.462 --> 02:10.672
[recording] <i>Next message.</i>

02:10.755 --> 02:13.007
[Katarina] <i>All those years</i>
<i>searching for answers</i>

02:13.091 --> 02:15.093
<i>and you were in front of me</i>
<i>the whole time.</i>

02:15.176 --> 02:16.427
[Raymond] <i>For what it's worth,</i>

02:16.511 --> 02:19.013
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>what Dom was planning in Belgrade.</i>

02:19.097 --> 02:20.098
[Katarina] <i>I believe you.</i>

02:20.598 --> 02:24.060
<i>But after,</i>
<i>you let the world believe the lie.</i>

02:24.144 --> 02:29.023
<i>You dangled me out there,</i>
<i>let everyone think I had the Archive.</i>

02:29.440 --> 02:30.567
<i>And now I know why.</i>

02:31.234 --> 02:34.362
<i>Because if they were chasing me,</i>
<i>it meant they weren't chasing you.</i>

02:34.988 --> 02:36.406
[Raymond] <i>It's not quite that simple.</i>

02:36.489 --> 02:38.158
You're N-13, aren't you?

02:39.534 --> 02:40.702
You framed me.

02:40.785 --> 02:44.539
You fed me to Townsend as a patsy,
and Dominic knew and helped you do it.

02:45.415 --> 02:46.916
[Raymond] <i>I could have helped you.</i>

02:48.459 --> 02:50.003
The way I always have.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.172
Kept you one step ahead.

02:54.757 --> 02:56.885
<i>But staying safe wasn't enough.</i>

02:57.886 --> 03:00.889
You needed answers.
Well, now you have them.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.392
And now they've destroyed you.

03:08.187 --> 03:11.399
[Katarina] <i>What if I promise</i>
<i>never to tell a soul what I've learned?</i>

03:11.482 --> 03:14.235
[Raymond] <i>Well, that would be</i>
<i>the last lie you ever told.</i>

03:14.319 --> 03:15.778
Raymond, we should go.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.832
You think this was a mistake?

03:28.374 --> 03:30.335
You ask a tactical question.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.171
I see only an ethical one.

03:34.505 --> 03:35.340
No.

03:36.299 --> 03:40.261
-It was not a mistake, but it was wrong.
-Because of Elizabeth.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.888
You've pushed her too far.

03:53.816 --> 03:54.651
I wonder.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.661
[dramatic music playing]

04:20.051 --> 04:21.803
Most of her clothes are gone.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.557
Where are you, Liz?

04:28.518 --> 04:29.644
What are you doing?

04:44.534 --> 04:45.785
Thank you, Miss Thomas.

04:45.868 --> 04:48.329
How would you like to pay
for the room this evening?

04:48.413 --> 04:49.247
Cash.

05:13.062 --> 05:15.773
[Katarina on voicemail] <i>You won't kill me.</i>
<i>You can't.</i>

05:17.233 --> 05:19.527
-[Raymond] <i>Why is that?</i>
<i>-Elizabeth would never forgive you.</i>

05:19.610 --> 05:21.779
[Raymond] <i>You don't know a damn thing</i>
<i>about Elizabeth.</i>

05:21.863 --> 05:23.364
[Katarina] <i>Oh, that's not true.</i>

05:23.448 --> 05:24.866
<i>I've gotten to know her.</i>

05:25.408 --> 05:28.786
So, she left her apartment.
What about Agnes?

05:28.870 --> 05:30.872
I spoke to a woman named Merritt Marks.

05:30.955 --> 05:33.207
She took Agnes home
with her daughter after school.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.335
Now, Liz called her a few hours ago,

05:35.418 --> 05:37.754
saying she had to leave town
for a work emergency

05:37.837 --> 05:40.381
and asked her
to take Agnes for a few days.

05:40.465 --> 05:44.552
So, we're nowhere.
We've lost track of Keen and her mother.

05:45.511 --> 05:46.596
[Katarina] <i>She chose me.</i>

05:47.180 --> 05:48.723
She's helping me.

05:48.806 --> 05:50.767
She has no idea who you are.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.770
Me? I'm her mother.

05:54.395 --> 05:56.939
<i>And even now, there's love there.</i>

05:59.734 --> 06:02.236
-[Raymond] <i>I can't let you leave.</i>
-[Katarina laughs]

06:02.320 --> 06:06.532
My God, I can't imagine
what this must be like for you.

06:07.408 --> 06:11.829
Knowing you can't kill me because
of how much Elizabeth loves her mother.

06:16.959 --> 06:18.336
[gunshots on voicemail]

06:23.216 --> 06:25.718
-[phone beeps]
-[suspenseful music playing]

06:25.802 --> 06:28.096
[Cooper] <i>That's right. Keen, Elizabeth.</i>

06:29.388 --> 06:31.974
It's just my gut,
but I don't think she left the city.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.061
Thanks, Joe, I appreciate your discretion.

06:44.529 --> 06:47.990
Do you have any idea how many favors
I've called in trying to find you?

06:50.576 --> 06:51.702
He killed her.

06:53.704 --> 06:55.123
Thank God you're okay.

06:58.459 --> 06:59.961
Did you hear what I said?

07:01.796 --> 07:03.047
It was an execution.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.760
We went to the park.
We couldn't find any evidence.

07:07.844 --> 07:11.722
That's why I'm here.
I have all the evidence you need.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.362
[Katarina] <i>I can't imagine</i>
<i>what this must be like for you.</i>

07:26.446 --> 07:30.616
<i>Knowing you can't kill me because</i>
<i>of how much Elizabeth loves her mother.</i>

07:30.700 --> 07:32.118
[gunshot on voicemail]

07:32.201 --> 07:34.203
[dramatic music playing]

07:37.415 --> 07:38.332
You saw it happen?

07:38.416 --> 07:40.710
With my own eyes, and I'll testify to it.

07:40.793 --> 07:44.088
I don't care what happens to me,
but he can't get away with this.

07:47.717 --> 07:48.801
Say something.

07:49.927 --> 07:51.554
-I'm thinking.
-About what?

07:51.637 --> 07:52.763
He murdered my mother.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.600
A Russian spy who tried
to bleed him to death.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.185
Who had your grandfather shot.

07:57.268 --> 08:00.897
Who our intelligence bureaus believe
killed at least a dozen American agents

08:00.980 --> 08:02.315
for the KGB and the Cabal.

08:02.398 --> 08:03.774
I know what she's done.

08:04.275 --> 08:07.278
-None of it justifies her execution.
-I'm not trying to justify it.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.447
Like hell you're not.
You're making excuses.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.240
Looking the other way like always.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.202
I was clear with Reddington,
your mother was not to be harmed.

08:14.285 --> 08:17.079
Well, he obviously took
that message to heart.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.501
You know why he did it? Because he could.

08:21.584 --> 08:24.170
He knew that no one was
gonna do anything about it.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.172
-That's unfair.
-It's the truth.

08:28.591 --> 08:31.761
When he shot her, I wanted to run.

08:32.512 --> 08:35.515
Just get Agnes and go
where nobody would find us.

08:36.724 --> 08:38.392
But I'm here because of you.

08:39.018 --> 08:42.480
I thought maybe you were the one person
who still cared about what's right.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.900
I won't be lectured by you
on professional ethics.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.110
Reddington's out of control. I know.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.656
I also know that I can't take him down
without taking you down with him.

08:51.739 --> 08:54.534
-I don't care anymore.
-Then I'll care for you.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.245
You kidnapped your grandfather.

08:57.328 --> 09:01.123
A felony kidnapping charge alone
can destroy your life, send you to prison,

09:01.207 --> 09:03.834
sever any relationship
you have with your daughter.

09:03.918 --> 09:07.630
You may be disgusted by my silence,
Agent Keen, but you will benefit from it.

09:07.713 --> 09:11.259
Everywhere I go, there's a man
who insists on protecting me.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.099
Elizabeth.

09:19.183 --> 09:20.893
If you want out, go.

09:22.144 --> 09:24.897
But I hope you'll think about
what we do here before you decide.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.235
It's over.

09:29.735 --> 09:32.196
Maybe. But I'm asking you...

09:33.406 --> 09:35.199
talk to Reddington first.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.410
What he did is inexcusable.

09:37.910 --> 09:42.206
But if you talk to him, if you could
get him to tell you why he did it,

09:42.290 --> 09:46.085
it won't bring her back,
but it may start the process of healing.

09:46.168 --> 09:47.003
It won't.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.464
But for you, I'll consider it, sir.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.553
If this is the last time
we see each other...

09:58.180 --> 10:00.766
for the first time,
I wish you would call me Harold.

10:02.602 --> 10:06.856
Even when you know I'm not gonna like it,
you've always been honest with me.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.110
Very few people have.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.530
Thank you for that...

10:16.032 --> 10:16.991
Harold.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.088
Any luck?

10:31.172 --> 10:33.591
No calls. Running taps on her cell
and apartment lines

10:33.674 --> 10:36.177
and a third on the friend
she asked to watch Agnes.

10:38.679 --> 10:41.057
If anyone can find me, my money's on you.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.224
You're here.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.644
You look tired.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.940
-Does Mr. Cooper know?
-Yeah, Cooper knows.

10:50.024 --> 10:52.401
-So, you talked?
-Talked? Yeah.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.487
Communicated? Not so much.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.073
Don't worry. He's angry, but in a day--

10:57.156 --> 10:59.575
-I don't know how to tell you this.
-He's gonna let you come back.

11:01.535 --> 11:02.953
I don't want to come back.

11:06.248 --> 11:10.878
I wanted to tell you in person
that I... have to step away for a bit,

11:10.961 --> 11:13.756
and so I'm not gonna see you
for a while...

11:14.799 --> 11:17.259
and I just want you to know
how grateful I am.

11:18.677 --> 11:20.971
-Wow. This is so hard.
-Oh.

11:21.055 --> 11:23.349
-Oh, wow, I'm so sorry.
-No, no, no.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.393
I'll just, uh--
Hang on, I'll grab paper towels.

11:25.476 --> 11:26.477
Sure.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.814
[suspenseful music playing]

11:35.403 --> 11:36.237
Coming.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.963
[Raymond] It's just a part of life.

11:54.463 --> 12:00.386
Watching the generation ahead of you,
the people you care about grow old.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.013
At some point, you start to...

12:04.765 --> 12:09.019
do the mental work necessary
to prepare yourself for the inevitable.

12:10.896 --> 12:14.358
And yet, I'm afraid
I stand here, Marvin...

12:15.526 --> 12:17.361
woefully unprepared.

12:19.196 --> 12:22.366
There's no way
you could prepare for this, Raymond.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.785
Dom didn't die of old age.

12:25.536 --> 12:26.871
He was taken from you.

12:28.956 --> 12:30.833
House won't be worth much.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.335
It's a relic from another time,
like he was.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.089
-You should bulldoze the house.
-Oh, yeah.

12:37.173 --> 12:41.051
Skip, the house has
incredible emotional value.

12:41.135 --> 12:43.804
Mr. Reddington has no interest
in bulldozing.

12:43.888 --> 12:47.892
Ultimately, it's not my decision.
The house belongs to Elizabeth now.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.519
[Raymond sighs]

12:50.603 --> 12:54.064
-Why do you say bulldoze it?
-Value's in the land, not the house.

12:54.648 --> 12:58.819
There's five acres. You subdivide.
Put a quarter-acre McMansion on each lot.

12:58.903 --> 13:02.531
McMansion? Take my advice.
Stop while you're behind.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.660
[chuckling] I must say,
it sounds pretty awful, Skip.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.872
But send me a proposal. I'll forward it.

13:09.955 --> 13:14.293
God knows if it were up to me,
given my recent bouts with mortality,

13:14.376 --> 13:18.172
I find myself more and more
in the liquidation phase.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.883
You are not going anywhere.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.219
As your lawyer, I forbid it.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.056
But while we're on the subject...

13:28.516 --> 13:33.270
You want to know if I still intend
to leave everything of mine to Elizabeth?

13:33.354 --> 13:35.356
[suspenseful music playing]

13:43.280 --> 13:45.658
Agent Keen,
what brings you down to the dungeon?

13:45.741 --> 13:49.703
Hey, Mark. Uh, Agent Mojtabai is running
some urgent wiretaps

13:49.787 --> 13:51.914
and he asked me to drop this off for him.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.959
Whoa, you don't see that every day.
What do you got going on?

13:55.042 --> 13:58.921
Same as always. Causing trouble
for the worst of the worst.

13:59.004 --> 14:02.174
I figured you couldn't tell me.
Hang on. Should be just a few minutes.

14:09.098 --> 14:12.685
You don't want me to change your will,
even after she took sides against you?

14:12.768 --> 14:16.397
Okay. So, today she opposes me.
Maybe tomorrow.

14:16.480 --> 14:22.361
But not forever. Look at Dom and I.
There were years when he hated me.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.864
Many more bad years than good.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.116
And yet, in the end...

14:28.534 --> 14:30.244
we found our way to each other.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.121
It's Elizabeth.

14:38.460 --> 14:39.295
Elizabeth.

14:39.378 --> 14:42.339
I told you what would happen
if you hurt my mother.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.382
Where are you?

14:43.465 --> 14:46.677
-You killed her in the park. I saw it.
<i>-I know what you saw.</i>

14:46.760 --> 14:48.846
And it wasn't everything
you thought you saw.

14:48.929 --> 14:50.681
<i>I told Cooper I'm done.</i>

14:50.764 --> 14:54.184
I'm taking Agnes, and we're leaving,
and you're gonna let us go.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.561
Not until we talk.

14:55.644 --> 14:58.022
-We're talking now.
<i>-Not like this.</i>

14:58.105 --> 15:00.274
There's a lake near Dom's house.

15:00.357 --> 15:03.193
I'm scattering his ashes there
this afternoon.

15:03.277 --> 15:06.655
<i>Meet us at the house</i>
<i>and we can talk on the way.</i>

15:06.739 --> 15:09.950
And if after our talk,
you still feel the same...

15:10.659 --> 15:12.661
you can say your goodbyes to us both.

15:13.913 --> 15:14.747
When?

15:16.165 --> 15:16.999
Two p.m.

15:19.418 --> 15:20.252
Is that a yes?

15:21.587 --> 15:22.421
I'll be there.

15:24.715 --> 15:25.883
You see, Marvin?

15:25.966 --> 15:30.512
It may feel at times like the end,
but our story isn't over yet.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.934
Here you go. Careful, now.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.102
Thanks. Wish us luck.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.146
You won't need it.
I don't know your target,

15:39.229 --> 15:41.398
but if you use that right,
he won't know what hit him.

15:52.534 --> 15:54.787
[dramatic music playing]

16:24.233 --> 16:25.067
Keen.

16:26.610 --> 16:27.736
Keen.

16:32.157 --> 16:35.452
-How'd you find me?
-Doesn't matter. Point is I did.

16:36.620 --> 16:39.206
If Cooper sent you to ask me
to come back, I'm not.

16:39.289 --> 16:43.669
Okay, first of all, he didn't ask me to.
He doesn't even know I'm here.

16:43.752 --> 16:46.463
And second, I agree,
you shouldn't come back.

16:47.297 --> 16:50.467
-Is that what you came to say?
-I came to say you're both right.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.971
Charging Reddington isn't an option
if it means that you go down with him.

16:54.054 --> 16:58.267
But... you coming back to work
like nothing ever happened,

16:58.350 --> 17:00.811
well, it's also not an option.

17:02.771 --> 17:04.982
-I gotta go.
-What are you doing here?

17:05.065 --> 17:07.985
-You left your apartment, parked Agnes--
-That's temporary.

17:08.068 --> 17:09.153
Until what?

17:14.450 --> 17:16.785
-What's going on with your car?
-Nothing. Just--

17:17.327 --> 17:20.539
-The passenger door was sticking.
-Want me to take a look?

17:20.622 --> 17:21.707
No. I fixed it.

17:23.792 --> 17:26.170
I know you.
We've been partners a long time,

17:26.253 --> 17:29.381
which is why I know you have
no intention of letting this rest.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.925
-I'm worried about you.
-Join the club.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.846
You, Cooper, Reddington,
the crew can sit around

17:35.929 --> 17:37.556
and talk about what's best for Liz.

17:37.639 --> 17:41.894
That's not fair. I care about you.
There's nothing wrong with me saying that.

17:43.854 --> 17:46.273
Are we done? Like I said, I gotta go.

17:46.356 --> 17:47.191
Yeah.

17:47.816 --> 17:49.818
We're done, Allison.

17:51.278 --> 17:53.989
How'd you know that, my alias?

17:54.073 --> 17:55.324
[snickers]

17:55.866 --> 17:59.620
You got drunk one night at Wing Yee.
You told me.

18:00.954 --> 18:02.623
So, that's how you found me.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.836
I'm gonna miss celebrating
your birthday there.

18:12.508 --> 18:13.717
Ressler.

18:16.053 --> 18:19.139
I'll think about what you said, I promise.

19:00.055 --> 19:03.142
I'm glad you came.
We have a lot to talk about.

19:04.852 --> 19:05.853
What's your plan?

19:07.646 --> 19:11.525
To try and sell me half-truths
that I could never verify...

19:12.860 --> 19:15.654
or to confuse me with doublespeak?

19:16.822 --> 19:18.574
-There is an explanation.
-No.

19:19.741 --> 19:20.993
Only a confession.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.829
I watched you kill her.

19:25.038 --> 19:27.958
And before you try to explain
how you didn't...

19:29.376 --> 19:33.380
[Katarina] <i>My God, I can't imagine</i>
<i>what this must be like for you.</i>

19:34.423 --> 19:38.677
<i>Knowing you can't kill me because</i>
<i>of how much Elizabeth loves her mother.</i>

19:39.845 --> 19:41.221
[gunshots on voicemail]

19:41.305 --> 19:43.307
[dramatic music playing]

19:45.100 --> 19:47.352
My mother prepared me for this moment.

19:49.521 --> 19:52.065
She gave me all the proof
I would ever need.

19:54.443 --> 19:59.156
If you came to play me that recording,
you've done it.

20:00.949 --> 20:02.659
You can take it and go...

20:03.827 --> 20:06.955
or you can stay while we lay
your grandfather to rest...

20:07.456 --> 20:09.750
and perhaps have a conversation.

20:13.921 --> 20:14.755
Fine.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.386
You ride with me. We'll talk on the way.

20:21.470 --> 20:22.346
Good idea.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.724
Dembe and I will go ahead
and meet you at the lake.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.209
Dembe.

20:57.839 --> 21:00.133
Traveler is down.
We need a mobile triage. Come on.

21:01.260 --> 21:05.973
No more than a ten-mile radius
outside 236 Glenellen, outside Sharptown.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.016
Get in.

21:08.600 --> 21:13.939
Listen to me. You are not allowed to die.
Do you hear me?

21:14.606 --> 21:16.149
Okay. Hang in. Hang in.

21:23.949 --> 21:28.245
Whatever happens, he loves you.
You know that, right?

21:29.621 --> 21:31.790
You chose that woman over him,

21:31.873 --> 21:34.126
and he still wants
to leave everything to you.

21:34.918 --> 21:38.130
That woman was my mother.
And he killed her.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.549
I don't want anything from him.

21:51.601 --> 21:53.145
What are you doing here?

21:53.228 --> 21:54.730
You're on call for an emergency.

21:54.813 --> 21:57.566
At a mobile unit. Not here.
This is a public emergency room.

21:57.649 --> 22:00.694
-How am I supposed to--?
-[Dembe] I spoke to the colonel.

22:00.777 --> 22:04.072
Closest mobile unit's 17 minutes out.
He needs help now.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.199
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll handle it.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.296
Mr. Cooper, I need your help.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.427
I'm sorry, but I can't.

22:25.510 --> 22:28.263
We're trying to help your friend,
but we need your help.

22:28.346 --> 22:29.598
He doesn't have insurance.

22:29.681 --> 22:32.392
And that's fine, but he has
to have personal information.

22:32.476 --> 22:34.436
Family history, medications?

22:34.519 --> 22:36.563
And as I explained to Miss Keats,

22:36.646 --> 22:39.733
I can only share those details
with his attending physician.

22:39.816 --> 22:42.152
His attending doesn't enter him
into my system.

22:42.235 --> 22:45.072
-I don't want him in your system.
-[woman 1] Mr. Vaughn.

22:45.155 --> 22:47.282
What's really going on here?
Who is that man?

22:47.365 --> 22:48.366
[woman 2] Who are you?

22:49.201 --> 22:50.577
His spiritual advisor.

22:50.660 --> 22:53.497
What kind of spiritual advisor
carries a gun in a hospital?

22:53.580 --> 22:55.999
Dembe, how is he?

22:56.708 --> 22:59.002
Not good. They're doing tests now.

22:59.086 --> 23:01.630
Who are you, another spiritual advisor?

23:01.713 --> 23:02.547
No.

23:03.340 --> 23:05.092
I'm the assistant director of the FBI,

23:05.175 --> 23:08.011
and I need you to get
your security team here.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.972
Tell them to secure this floor.
Lock it down.

23:14.810 --> 23:17.145
-[Esi] Woman, are you out of your mind?
-Yes.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.898
-You want to murder Reddington.
-I tried.

23:19.981 --> 23:23.151
-I need your help to finish the job.
-And why exactly would I do that?

23:23.235 --> 23:27.405
Because you know he's gonna kill you.
That's why you're working with him.

23:27.489 --> 23:30.117
He threatened your life,
forced you to turn on me.

23:30.200 --> 23:33.912
What do you think happens to you
when you're no longer of use to him?

23:33.995 --> 23:36.081
[suspenseful music playing]

23:36.164 --> 23:40.460
Esi, I understand if you don't want
to do it. I'll figure something out.

23:41.878 --> 23:44.589
But I'm gonna kill him
with or without your help.

23:45.799 --> 23:46.633
How?

23:46.716 --> 23:49.094
The how is the easy part.
I gotta get to him first.

23:49.177 --> 23:50.262
You know where he is?

23:50.345 --> 23:52.597
Everheart Memorial Hospital, in lockdown,

23:52.681 --> 23:56.017
surrounded by an army of FBI agents
in protective detail.

23:56.101 --> 23:59.855
Being assisted by hospital security
who have every inch of that building

23:59.938 --> 24:01.439
secure with CCTV.

24:01.523 --> 24:04.276
Not to mention his body man
and the security team,

24:04.359 --> 24:07.195
which is en route if not already there.

24:10.031 --> 24:11.116
Let me.

24:12.576 --> 24:13.410
What?

24:13.493 --> 24:17.539
I can get to him. Reddington trusts me.
I'm part of his team.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.499
He'll kill you if he finds out.

24:19.583 --> 24:22.085
Didn't you just say
he was gonna kill me anyway?

24:22.169 --> 24:23.086
Yes.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.379
I don't doubt it.

24:24.462 --> 24:26.506
His threats to me were very real.

24:26.590 --> 24:29.801
And I'd rather get this done
than be dragged into the grave with him.

24:31.469 --> 24:32.470
Okay.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.391
-Here's what I was thinking.
-[elevator dings]

24:36.474 --> 24:39.311
<i>Our best option is</i>
<i>to just lean into the truth.</i>

24:39.394 --> 24:42.272
<i>All it will take is one call</i>
<i>to cause pandemonium.</i>

24:42.355 --> 24:43.899
Hold on. What's going on?

24:43.982 --> 24:47.611
Gib Horn. U.S. marshal.
An anonymous caller gave us a tip.

24:47.694 --> 24:49.154
You have a fugitive on-site.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.990
-What are you talking about?
-Don't play dumb.

24:52.073 --> 24:54.367
Raymond Reddington. Where is he?

24:54.451 --> 24:58.163
Now, the marshals will cause a diversion,
but we're still fighting the clock

24:58.246 --> 25:00.999
because everyone
in Reddington's inner circle is working

25:01.082 --> 25:04.502
to move him as fast as they can
from the hospital to a secure site.

25:04.586 --> 25:07.047
Yes. He's medicated and under observation.

25:07.130 --> 25:10.175
-But he's not stable enough to be moved.
-Well, he's not safe here.

25:10.258 --> 25:13.386
-You shouldn't have brought him here.
-We didn't have a choice.

25:13.470 --> 25:15.430
No. What we have is a protocol.

25:15.513 --> 25:17.265
Sir, we have a situation.

25:17.349 --> 25:20.685
-He's a fugitive. He's our responsibility.
-Not if we're guarding him.

25:20.769 --> 25:24.522
-What does that mean, "guarding him"?
-Harold Cooper. What the hell is going on?

25:25.649 --> 25:26.983
Gib Horn, U.S. marshals.

25:27.067 --> 25:30.779
I'm here to take the top fugitive
from your Most Wanted list into custody.

25:30.862 --> 25:34.783
-Is that gonna be a problem?
-That's... complicated.

25:34.866 --> 25:36.534
How about you uncomplicate it?

25:36.618 --> 25:39.037
Our other ticking clock is Aram.

25:39.120 --> 25:42.082
-Who's Aram?
-He's a very smart colleague of mine.

25:42.165 --> 25:45.543
I got my hands on the weapon
by using one of his requisition forms.

25:45.627 --> 25:48.380
<i>It's not gonna take him long</i>
<i>to figure out something's wrong.</i>

25:48.463 --> 25:51.299
Yes, I'm positive.
Meaning, no, I didn't request it.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.469
-Can you please check the logs for me?
-[Esi] <i>Hold on just one second.</i>

25:54.552 --> 25:57.097
Say we call in the marshals
and they cause this mess,

25:57.180 --> 26:00.058
and say your Aram friend
doesn't figure out

26:00.141 --> 26:04.104
that you've stolen military-grade
explosives from the FBI locker,

26:04.187 --> 26:07.941
and say, just for the sake of argument,
that I do get inside that hospital...

26:08.441 --> 26:11.278
we're still gonna have to come up
with some story

26:11.361 --> 26:13.863
in order for Reddington's guards
to let me near him.

26:13.947 --> 26:16.199
That's the beauty of it.
We don't need a story.

26:16.283 --> 26:19.577
All you have to do is tell them the truth.

26:20.578 --> 26:22.247
What exactly is the truth?

26:22.330 --> 26:23.915
[Bud] Dembe, she won't tell me.

26:23.999 --> 26:26.710
She says it's urgent
and she needs to speak to you directly.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.170
Esi, the feds have cleared the floor.

26:29.254 --> 26:32.007
They're not even letting
the marshals see him, let alone you.

26:37.053 --> 26:40.223
I don't care what you all want
to believe or not. I'm telling you,

26:40.307 --> 26:44.602
Elizabeth Keen is on her way here now
to murder Raymond Reddington.

26:48.231 --> 26:51.109
That's not what I'm saying.
We're not even confirming he's here.

26:51.192 --> 26:53.111
I'm not asking you. I know he's here,

26:53.194 --> 26:57.240
or you wouldn't have cleared the floor.
I'm asking what JTTF you work for.

26:57.324 --> 26:59.868
Get her out of the meeting.
I don't care who she's with.

26:59.951 --> 27:02.704
Tell her Harold Cooper has
a mission request that's urgent.

27:02.787 --> 27:07.083
-He can't verify because we're off book.
-Somebody sure as hell calls the shots.

27:07.167 --> 27:10.337
Okay, I've got DOJ on the line.
If you give me just a few minutes.

27:10.420 --> 27:11.671
Deacon spoke to Judge Wolf.

27:11.755 --> 27:14.215
-A court order is in the works.
-Okay, hold on.

27:14.299 --> 27:17.427
I'll hold till my court order comes.
Then we're taking Reddington.

27:17.510 --> 27:20.597
Cynthia, it's me.
I need you to make a phone call.

27:20.680 --> 27:21.931
[elevator dings]

27:23.516 --> 27:25.518
[suspenseful music playing]

27:40.116 --> 27:41.076
Talk to me.

27:41.701 --> 27:44.913
She came to me, said she needed my help.
Said she was gonna kill him.

27:44.996 --> 27:45.997
Elizabeth said this?

27:46.081 --> 27:49.459
Yes. She sounded crazy.
She said something about her mother,

27:49.542 --> 27:52.128
how he killed her, how she couldn't
let him get away with it.

27:52.212 --> 27:53.505
Okay, calm down.

27:54.005 --> 27:56.216
There are police everywhere.
He's well-protected.

27:56.299 --> 27:59.010
You don't get it. She knows he's here.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.554
She told me to come see you
to get her his location.

28:01.638 --> 28:02.931
Elizabeth is coming here?

28:03.014 --> 28:04.974
She'll never make it past the perimeter.

28:05.058 --> 28:07.727
Don't underestimate Elizabeth.
Get back downstairs.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.814
Tell me what she's planning.

28:10.897 --> 28:13.942
[Esi] I don't know,
only that she wanted me to be her eyes.

28:14.025 --> 28:16.486

to give her his room number.

-If you're gonna do it, do it now.

28:32.836 --> 28:35.004
-Is it clear?
<i>-Yes, like you said.</i>

28:35.088 --> 28:37.966
They cleared the floor. He's in room 312.

-I'm already in the building.

28:47.183 --> 28:48.017
thank you.

28:49.853 --> 28:52.313
Bud, Elizabeth is in the building,

28:52.814 --> 28:54.149
Do not leave his side.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.491
[Ressler] <i>What requisition form?</i>

29:03.575 --> 29:07.287
From my desk. Liz used it
to withdraw 16 ounces of Semtex

at 10:42 this morning.

29:10.749 --> 29:14.127
She's coming for Reddington.
Aram, get here now.

29:14.210 --> 29:15.420
Park, notify Cooper.

29:16.880 --> 29:20.133
-Keen's coming for Reddington.
-I know. She's in the building now.

29:20.717 --> 29:21.968
How do you know that?

29:22.051 --> 29:24.262
We need to move Raymond. He's not safe.

29:28.099 --> 29:30.226
Park, tell Cooper to mobilize
the Medevac unit.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.353
We gotta get Reddington out of here now.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.814
-Why? What happened?
<i>-Keen is in the building.</i>

30:20.485 --> 30:21.444
It's okay.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.989
Go to sleep. It's just a dream.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.371
-What's going on? Who are you?
-Esi Jackson.

30:31.454 --> 30:33.915
Dembe asked me to stay with Reddington.

30:33.998 --> 30:37.001
You gotta go. It's not safe.
Park, where are we on that Medevac?

30:37.085 --> 30:38.670
-You gotta go now.
-[Cooper] <i>Agent Ressler.</i>

Get Reddington to the helipad.

-Is that thing what I think it is?
-Hey!

You-- Go now. Get out.

You want to know what else is fantastic?

After today, Mommy's not gonna have
to leave for work ever again.

32:18.394 --> 32:21.314
Okay, whatever's going on at the hospital,
that is some bull.

32:21.397 --> 32:24.901
-What a silly question, Agnes.
-Wrap it up. We gotta talk.

What do you think I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna be with you.

32:27.695 --> 32:31.991
I have to take care of one last thing,
and then I'm coming to get you, okay?

32:32.075 --> 32:35.745
Goodbye, munchkin.
Mama loves you very much.

32:36.287 --> 32:39.540
Munchkin is right because we are
somewhere over some kind of rainbow.

32:39.624 --> 32:42.210
-What'd you find out?
-Not a damn thing.

32:42.293 --> 32:45.797
-What do you mean? We heard the explosion.
-What I mean is, I don't know.

32:45.880 --> 32:48.591
I mean, I do know.
He couldn't have survived.

32:49.175 --> 32:50.551
But no one would confirm it.

32:50.635 --> 32:53.805
You know the whole "if a tree fell,
did anyone hear it" thing?

32:53.888 --> 32:55.932
-This is like that.
-Except this is a bomb,

32:56.015 --> 32:58.810
and people definitely heard it.
Tell me again.

32:59.560 --> 33:02.981
Is there a possibility that anyone
other than Reddington was hurt?

33:03.064 --> 33:05.733
Not if your plan would've worked.
But your agent friend--

33:05.817 --> 33:10.113
The agent you said went into the room.
Is there any way he made it out in time?

33:10.196 --> 33:11.656
I don't think so.

33:14.742 --> 33:15.576
I'm sorry.

Aram, are you there?

33:28.297 --> 33:31.217
If by "there" you mean
at the scene of your crime...

33:32.844 --> 33:35.263
yes, I'm there.

33:35.346 --> 33:37.473
And Reddington, is he--?

33:37.557 --> 33:40.018
Do not ask me to bear witness
to what you've done.

33:42.061 --> 33:44.647
So... he's dead.

33:44.731 --> 33:46.441
<i>I know about the requisition form.</i>

33:46.524 --> 33:48.526
How you forged my signature.

to attempted murder.

-Did you say "attempted"?
<i>-I looked it up. I knew what it was.</i>

33:57.827 --> 33:59.954
<i>But I thought I would double-check.</i>

34:00.038 --> 34:03.207
I can go to jail for life for each count.

34:03.291 --> 34:04.751
"Each count"?

34:04.834 --> 34:06.669
<i>That is two life sentences.</i>

34:06.753 --> 34:10.006
With my luck,
they won't even be served concurrently.

34:10.089 --> 34:13.134
Aram, listen to me.
You gotta tell me what happened.

34:13.968 --> 34:15.720
Mr. Reddington survived.

34:15.803 --> 34:17.096
And Ressler?

-The doctors are with him now.
<i>-But he's gonna be okay?</i>

34:25.646 --> 34:26.647
Aram.

34:27.565 --> 34:28.983
I was just thinking...

34:30.943 --> 34:32.153
next time I see you...

34:33.321 --> 34:34.697
you'll be under arrest.

34:39.786 --> 34:41.871
[Cooper] You saved Reddington's life.

Is that a compliment or a criticism?

And the lives of everyone on this floor.

34:47.085 --> 34:51.839
I just-- I can't understand how Liz could
have been okay with any of this.

34:52.340 --> 34:53.674
I don't think she was.

34:54.175 --> 34:57.762
I think she knew the protocols
would leave Reddington vulnerable.

34:57.845 --> 35:01.140
I'm sure once forensics are run
on the explosive device,

35:01.224 --> 35:04.602
it'll indicate the blast radius
was limited to Reddington's room.

35:04.685 --> 35:05.770
And that's okay?

35:05.853 --> 35:08.648
Absolutely not.
Just because I don't believe

35:08.731 --> 35:11.192
she intended to hurt anyone else
doesn't mean it's okay

35:11.275 --> 35:12.902
she tried to kill Reddington.

35:13.444 --> 35:16.739
-What's the prognosis, doc?
-Some lacerations will require stitches.

35:16.823 --> 35:19.492
And I've ordered a CT scan
to check for internal bleeding.

35:19.575 --> 35:23.371
But all things considered, I'd say
you're in miraculously good shape.

35:24.413 --> 35:25.540

-The warrant.

35:30.002 --> 35:31.587
If he got it, it's over.

I think it's over either way.

[suspenseful music playing]

35:44.976 --> 35:47.854
-I assume that's your court order.
-It should be.

35:48.896 --> 35:51.858
-But?
-But you've got some serious juice.

A cease-and-desist order from
the deputy AG herself and a gag order.

My team's gonna have to sign NDAs
like this never happened.

35:58.906 --> 36:00.241
It's nothing personal.

36:00.324 --> 36:03.161
I appreciate your needing
to dot your I's and cross your T's.

36:03.244 --> 36:05.246
In your position,
I would have done the same.

36:05.329 --> 36:07.373
But you're not in my position.

36:07.456 --> 36:10.418
I'm here to arrest a criminal.
You're protecting him.

36:11.627 --> 36:15.256
-Our task force does good work.
-I'm sure you do, sometimes.

36:15.756 --> 36:19.468
But what that order tells me
is you've got a tiger by the tail.

36:20.052 --> 36:22.972
And for every job well done,
there's a corner that gets cut,

36:23.055 --> 36:26.976
a rule gets bent, an I that doesn't
get dotted, a T that doesn't get crossed.

36:27.059 --> 36:29.562
And... Nothing personal.

36:30.646 --> 36:33.691
But if I was you,
I couldn't live with myself.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.950
[Esi] Well, this sure worked out.

36:43.034 --> 36:46.245
Now we've got Reddington after us
and the FBI.

36:46.329 --> 36:47.538
[Liz] It's gonna be okay.

36:47.622 --> 36:49.415
Really? How?

36:49.498 --> 36:53.669
Because this right here, this is about
as not okay as I've ever felt.

36:54.670 --> 36:56.631
Eighty-six bodies.

36:56.714 --> 36:57.632
What?

36:59.634 --> 37:02.220
A few years ago, Reddington's cleaner

37:02.303 --> 37:06.557
unearthed the bodies
of 86 people he'd killed.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.018
Handed them over to the FBI.

37:09.769 --> 37:12.647

37:12.730 --> 37:14.440
And he's still out there.

37:16.025 --> 37:18.736
I've seen how he does it,
stays one step ahead.

37:19.528 --> 37:20.863
I know how he does it.

you realized how dull
life would be without me.

37:38.923 --> 37:41.175
If by "dull" you mean normal, then yes.
