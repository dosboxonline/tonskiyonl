WEBVTT

00:51.900 --> 00:54.060
First time giving blood?

00:55.650 --> 00:57.570
Yes.

00:58.820 --> 01:00.740
They pay cash here.

01:00.820 --> 01:03.410
And there's no limit
to how many times you give.

01:03.490 --> 01:05.530
They even buy it
in the jar.

01:05.620 --> 01:08.750
Jared Nomak,
we're ready for you.

01:21.970 --> 01:24.970
In the past 12 months,
have you gotten a tattoo,

01:25.050 --> 01:28.020
or undergone any ear,
skin, or body piercings?

01:28.060 --> 01:29.520
No.

01:29.600 --> 01:32.020
Where did you get
that scar on your chin?

01:33.270 --> 01:35.230
Childhood accident.

01:35.310 --> 01:38.280
You say you don't have
any immediate next of kin,

01:38.360 --> 01:40.860
- is that right?
- Not that I'm in contact with.

01:40.950 --> 01:43.030
Nobody to call in case
of an emergency?

01:43.110 --> 01:44.700
No one.

01:44.780 --> 01:47.370
- No family?
- I told you, no.

01:47.450 --> 01:51.790
Are you telling me
I can't be a donor?

01:51.870 --> 01:54.170
It depends.
We came up

01:54.250 --> 01:56.210
with some unusual results
on your blood test.

01:56.290 --> 01:58.210
What?

01:58.300 --> 02:00.220
How unusual?

02:01.470 --> 02:03.340
Let me explain.

02:03.430 --> 02:06.180
Your blood has
a very rare phenotype,

02:06.260 --> 02:08.600
one we haven't
encountered before.

02:11.140 --> 02:14.980
What? What are you
talking about?

02:15.060 --> 02:18.480
- Who are you? No.
- Sit down, please.

02:20.650 --> 02:22.200
What is this?

02:22.280 --> 02:27.080
This is a good news-bad news
scenario, Jared.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.910
Good news for us...

02:31.000 --> 02:33.080
bad news...

02:34.830 --> 02:37.090
...for you.

03:40.190 --> 03:42.780
Forget what you think
you know--

03:42.860 --> 03:45.620
vampires exist.

03:48.370 --> 03:51.790
My name is Blade.

03:51.870 --> 03:55.500
I was born half human,
half vampire.

03:57.040 --> 04:00.710
They call me
"The Daywalker."

04:02.800 --> 04:05.050
I have all their strengths,

04:05.140 --> 04:07.890
none of their weaknesses.

04:07.970 --> 04:10.480
Except for the thirst.

04:11.810 --> 04:15.060
20 years ago I met a man
that changed that.

04:15.150 --> 04:18.529
Whistler.

04:18.610 --> 04:21.399
He taught me how to hold
the thirst at bay.

04:21.490 --> 04:23.910
Taught me the rules.

04:23.990 --> 04:26.580
Gave me the weapons
to hunt with.

04:26.660 --> 04:30.190
Silver, garlic,

04:30.290 --> 04:32.410
sunlight.

04:32.490 --> 04:35.080
Two years ago
he was attacked.

04:35.160 --> 04:36.750
They took him,

04:36.840 --> 04:40.170
and turned him into
the thing I hate most.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.590
I should have
finished him off.

04:44.670 --> 04:46.880
Now I'm hunting him.

04:50.210 --> 04:52.130
I will find him.

04:52.230 --> 04:55.550
And nothing will stand
in my way.

05:18.620 --> 05:20.580
Daywalker's here!
Stop him!

05:34.480 --> 05:36.480
Where is he?

06:20.820 --> 06:22.560
Hey!

08:14.480 --> 08:15.980
No, no.

08:22.140 --> 08:26.410
Take me to him, and I'll
consider you a loose end.

10:48.040 --> 10:50.430
Catch you later.

11:28.180 --> 11:32.630
Old man... look at what
they've done to you.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.530
Let's go home.

13:16.250 --> 13:18.070
Lock up your daughters,
boys and girls,

13:18.120 --> 13:20.880
the dark knight returns.

13:25.170 --> 13:27.920
- Need a toke of the smokage, B?
- Later.

13:27.970 --> 13:30.130
Cut the lights.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.430
You found him.

13:41.060 --> 13:43.940
You didn't kill him.

13:44.020 --> 13:47.700
Give me a hand.

13:50.700 --> 13:52.780
I got a bad feeling
about this, B.

13:54.490 --> 13:58.120
Listen to his breathing.
He's already dying. He's in pain.

13:58.210 --> 14:00.120
Why don't you just put him
out of his misery right now?

14:00.210 --> 14:02.330
They had him on stasis
in a halfway house.

14:02.410 --> 14:06.250
I'm giving him an accelerated
retro-viral detox.

14:06.300 --> 14:09.590
Like a heroin addict.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.640
Make him go cold turkey
in one night.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.460
Shit ain't
going to work, man.

14:13.510 --> 14:15.600
I say you kill the motherfucker
right now.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.470
Get out.

14:26.490 --> 14:29.770
If there's anything left
of you in there, Whistler,

14:29.860 --> 14:32.230
listen up.

14:32.320 --> 14:36.240
In the morning those blinds
are going to open

14:36.330 --> 14:38.450
whether you're cured...

14:38.490 --> 14:40.450
or not.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.640
Hey, man,
I didn't mean to call him--

15:33.220 --> 15:37.060
Listen to me, Blade.

15:37.140 --> 15:39.690
You're going to have
to finish me off.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.190
No.

15:41.230 --> 15:44.690
Give me
that damn gun.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.030
Now walk away.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.700
Stubborn son of a bitch.

16:47.010 --> 16:49.430
How do you feel?

16:54.180 --> 16:56.590
Like hammered shit.

17:00.480 --> 17:02.390
How'd you find me?

17:02.470 --> 17:06.740
I started out in Moscow.
Then Romania.

17:06.819 --> 17:11.770
- They kept moving you around.
- How long was I gone?

17:13.819 --> 17:17.650
- Months?
- Too long.

17:23.750 --> 17:25.920
Years.

17:28.510 --> 17:30.800
They tortured me
almost to death.

17:30.840 --> 17:33.930
And then let me heal
in a vat of blood

17:34.000 --> 17:36.880
so they could go
at it again.

17:39.020 --> 17:41.100
Sorry sons of bitches
could have at least

17:41.180 --> 17:43.440
fixed my goddamn leg
while they were at it.

17:46.600 --> 17:49.150
Where's my arc welder?

18:04.250 --> 18:07.210
What's up? Nice to meet you.
I heard a lot about you.

18:07.290 --> 18:10.710
I'm Josh. You can call me "Scud."
Everybody does.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.570
Tell me something, Skid--

18:24.640 --> 18:27.030
No, man, it's "Scud,"
like "Stud."

18:27.070 --> 18:28.740
Whatever.

18:28.810 --> 18:31.860
- What are you doing here?
- The pimpmobile?

18:31.910 --> 18:34.450
Just a little aftermarket
modification.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.910
- Nitrous oxide and shit like that.
- Oh, yeah.

18:35.980 --> 18:38.570
You gave it a more aggressive
exhaust profile ramping.

18:38.660 --> 18:41.860
The whole package will crank
that Betty up, maybe 300 horsepower.

18:41.920 --> 18:45.080
You'll burn the thing out
before your next oil change.

18:45.170 --> 18:48.050
Where did you dig up
this shitbird, anyway?

18:48.080 --> 18:49.910
What the fuck
is your problem, Poppy?

18:50.010 --> 18:53.140
My problem is I've been
sucking blood clots for two years.

18:53.220 --> 18:56.670
I get out to find some jerkoff
fucking with my life's work.

18:56.770 --> 18:59.100
We jeopardized our whole
operation to save your ass!

18:59.170 --> 19:00.630
- Our operation?
- Yeah.

19:00.720 --> 19:04.690
Our operation? I built
this operation, you ass-wipe!

19:07.890 --> 19:10.860
Motion sensors!
It's on three, gentlemen.

19:10.950 --> 19:12.780
Human?

19:12.850 --> 19:16.580
Body temperature, 50.
I'd guess suckhead.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.910
Fried. They're using
magnesium flares.

19:25.960 --> 19:29.090
They've got your security
system scoped out.

19:30.760 --> 19:33.260
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't trust you--

20:17.350 --> 20:19.520
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:19.590 --> 20:20.980
Cool outfit.

20:28.650 --> 20:30.490
Guard lights!

22:28.140 --> 22:30.820
We represent the ruling body
of the Vampire Nation.

22:32.110 --> 22:34.200
They are offering you
a truce.

22:34.280 --> 22:36.980
They want to meet
with you.

22:40.540 --> 22:42.320
Scud.

22:44.500 --> 22:46.990
Take off your mask.

22:52.370 --> 22:56.290
My name is Asad.
This is Nyssa.

22:59.720 --> 23:02.260
You have been our most
feared enemy.

23:02.350 --> 23:05.800
But now there's something else
loose on the streets.

23:05.890 --> 23:08.480
Something worse
than you.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.290
What's so funny?

23:25.380 --> 23:29.050
They tell stories about Blade
as the Bogeyman.

23:29.120 --> 23:30.950
Frankly,
I'm disappointed.

23:31.040 --> 23:35.300
You hear that, B?
She's disappointed.

23:35.380 --> 23:38.850
He agreed
to come along so easily.

23:38.880 --> 23:42.640
Come on, B, show her.
Pretty please?

23:45.010 --> 23:47.510
Semtex.

23:49.230 --> 23:51.640
Enough explosives
to level a city block.

23:54.020 --> 23:56.160
You still disappointed?

24:18.350 --> 24:21.260
The guards look human.
They're probably familiars.

24:39.530 --> 24:41.610
You sure about this?

24:41.690 --> 24:44.120
Well, if I'm not...

24:55.720 --> 24:58.500
The true power
of the Vampire Nation lies here.

25:10.640 --> 25:12.150
Father?

25:19.480 --> 25:23.790
Blade, this is
Overlord Eli Damaskinos.

25:28.490 --> 25:31.250
It has been said,
"Be proud of your enemy

25:31.340 --> 25:33.460
and enjoy his success."

25:33.510 --> 25:36.550
In that regard,
I should thank you.

25:36.640 --> 25:39.460
- For what?
- Eliminating Deacon Frost.

25:39.510 --> 25:42.810
You did us a favor.
Karel Kounen.

25:45.430 --> 25:47.860
- You're human.
- Barely. I'm a lawyer.

25:47.900 --> 25:50.140
European Health Consortium.

25:50.190 --> 25:53.520
As you may know,
Vampirism is...

25:53.610 --> 25:58.830
a horrible virus, carried
in the saliva of predators.

25:58.860 --> 26:02.870
In 72 hours, it spreads through
the human bloodstream,

26:02.950 --> 26:06.410
creating new
parasitic organs.

26:06.500 --> 26:08.160
Like cancer.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.370
Cancer with a purpose.

26:14.880 --> 26:17.600
Unfortunately,
viruses evolve, too.

26:17.670 --> 26:19.750
We've encountered
a new one.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.710
We dubbed it
the Reaper Strain.

26:21.770 --> 26:26.220
And like any good pathogen,
it appears to have found a carrier.

26:34.310 --> 26:36.020
There...
Jared Nomak.

26:36.070 --> 26:40.540
Born a vampire,
but an anomaly like you.

26:42.030 --> 26:44.210
Unlike the rest of us,
however,

26:44.290 --> 26:47.170
he feeds on not just humans,

26:47.240 --> 26:50.200
but vampires as well.

26:50.240 --> 26:54.120
- Looks like he was doing me a favor.
- You're missing the point.

26:54.220 --> 26:56.210
Their vampire victims
don't die...

26:56.300 --> 27:00.130
they turn.
They become carriers.

27:00.220 --> 27:03.230
You've got to understand.
These things are like crack addicts.

27:03.310 --> 27:08.100
They need to feed daily.
Nomak's been up for 72 hours.

27:08.150 --> 27:11.940
By our estimates, there are already
a dozen Reapers.

27:11.970 --> 27:14.480
There'll be hundreds
before the week is out.

27:14.570 --> 27:18.580
Thousands within a matter of months.
Do the math.

27:18.650 --> 27:20.610
Wait. Let me get
this right.

27:20.660 --> 27:24.870
You want me
to hunt them... for you?

27:24.960 --> 27:26.290
When they are finished
with us,

27:26.320 --> 27:29.620
who do you think
they'll turn on next?

27:29.670 --> 27:32.380
Your precious humans.

27:32.450 --> 27:36.300
Not one of them
will be left.

27:36.340 --> 27:39.130
We spent two years training
a small tactical unit--

27:39.180 --> 27:41.890
The Bloodpack.
We want you to lead them.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.980
Two years?

27:45.340 --> 27:47.520
We've been training
to hunt you.

27:51.030 --> 27:52.990
So, B-man,
what do you think?

27:53.030 --> 27:55.320
Sounds like a plan.

27:55.360 --> 27:57.350
What do you really think?

27:57.450 --> 28:00.330
They're going to fuck us
the first chance they get.

28:01.870 --> 28:04.900
So, we ain't
gonna do this, right?

28:05.000 --> 28:06.920
We'll play along for now.

28:06.990 --> 28:09.920
They'll take us in deeper
than we've ever been.

28:09.990 --> 28:12.920
Get a chance to see
how their world really ticks.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.430
I had enough of their world.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.420
They're just shitting bricks

28:17.510 --> 28:20.590
because they're no longer
top of the food chain.

28:20.670 --> 28:24.430
Damn, man,
I'm really worried about him.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.430
I know he's
your friend and all,

28:26.520 --> 28:28.760
but I think you should
watch him.

28:28.860 --> 28:33.280
Nobody goes cold turkey
from the thirst in just one night.

29:15.310 --> 29:16.900
Looking to get
hooked up?

29:16.980 --> 29:19.410
Maybe.
What do you have?

29:19.480 --> 29:21.070
No problem.

29:21.150 --> 29:25.610
Horse, Hawaiian Ice,
whatever you need.

29:25.710 --> 29:28.420
Whatever I need.

29:28.490 --> 29:32.300
I like that.
What if I need you?

29:47.020 --> 29:49.180
So, so sweet.

30:25.770 --> 30:28.840
They are ready
whenever you are, Daywalker.

30:42.400 --> 30:45.330
Blade,
meet The Bloodpack.

30:46.900 --> 30:50.670
Lighthammer,
Verlaine,

30:50.740 --> 30:54.620
Priest,
Snowman,

30:54.670 --> 30:57.470
Chupa,
and Reinhardt.

31:11.180 --> 31:13.140
Hey, um...

31:13.190 --> 31:15.570
me and the gang
were wondering...

31:18.530 --> 31:21.160
What was that?

31:21.190 --> 31:24.160
Can you blush?

31:24.190 --> 31:26.700
Here we go.

31:29.630 --> 31:32.000
Oh, I get it.

31:32.030 --> 31:33.870
I see now.

31:33.960 --> 31:37.670
You've been training for two years
to take me out.

31:37.720 --> 31:40.430
And now, here I am.

31:40.500 --> 31:44.300
Ooh, so exciting,
isn't it?

31:44.390 --> 31:47.230
Okay, here's your chance.

31:48.690 --> 31:52.570
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

31:52.600 --> 31:54.470
Here I am.
Right here in front of you.

31:54.560 --> 31:57.150
Adolf here gets the first shot.
Come on.

31:57.240 --> 32:00.310
What are you looking at her for?
You need permission?

32:00.410 --> 32:02.520
Maybe you need
a little bit of incentive.

32:02.620 --> 32:04.580
Okay, I can help
with that.

32:06.860 --> 32:08.910
What's the matter?
Missed that?

32:09.000 --> 32:10.740
It's okay,
I can do it again.

32:14.370 --> 32:17.090
Come on.
What, do you need a manual?

32:17.180 --> 32:18.830
- Do it!
- Kill the bastard!

32:26.730 --> 32:30.550
Now you've got an explosive device
stuck to the back of your head.

32:30.610 --> 32:34.570
Silver nitrate. Rigged to go off
if anybody tampers with it.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.810
I'll have
the detonator with me.

32:36.900 --> 32:40.780
And you-- if you so much
as look at me wrong--

32:44.450 --> 32:47.210
From now on
we work as a unit.

32:47.290 --> 32:50.330
You'll be taking
orders from me.

32:51.830 --> 32:53.990
Any questions?

32:59.590 --> 33:01.340
Good.

33:03.970 --> 33:07.340
You want to catch the hunter?
You start with the prey.

33:07.430 --> 33:13.530
We'll target all the night places
where vampires congregate.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.240
Blood banks, safe houses.

33:15.320 --> 33:17.770
The bigger the better.

33:17.850 --> 33:21.650
So... what's first?

33:25.030 --> 33:27.280
The House of Pain.

33:39.880 --> 33:43.170
Where's the entrance?

33:43.220 --> 33:44.770
I don't see any signs.

33:44.840 --> 33:47.300
No vampire glyphs.

33:47.390 --> 33:51.190
No, because of you,
we've had to rethink our habits,

33:51.220 --> 33:53.820
tighten our security.

33:55.390 --> 33:57.480
Have a closer look.

34:04.530 --> 34:06.740
Nice.

34:06.830 --> 34:08.620
.38, .45
and 9mm caliber.

34:08.699 --> 34:11.130
All with foil capsules
at the tip

34:11.199 --> 34:13.280
filled with silver nitrate,
and garlic extract.

34:13.370 --> 34:15.449
This hyper-velocity
stake gun

34:15.550 --> 34:18.870
spits out a silver stake
at 6,000 feet per second.

34:18.929 --> 34:21.210
Since you suckers
don't like sunlight,

34:21.260 --> 34:25.060
we've modified the gun's
entry light with a UV filter.

34:25.130 --> 34:27.880
Pop it open--
instant UV light.

34:29.679 --> 34:31.639
Filter's on,
no problem.

34:31.730 --> 34:33.350
Yo, B, check this out.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.679
It's got an pneumatic
syringe delivery system.

34:35.730 --> 34:38.560
The vials are filled with
an anti-coagulant called EDTA.

34:38.650 --> 34:41.870
One punch with this, you'll blow
your target up like a balloon.

34:41.909 --> 34:44.790
The cartridge ejects.
Automatic reload.

34:44.870 --> 34:46.739
Nice.

34:48.070 --> 34:51.670
- Let's go.
- You won't pass for one of us.

34:51.739 --> 34:55.670
- Like I give a shit.
- No, he's right.

34:55.750 --> 34:58.000
Why don't you post up
on the roof over there?

34:58.080 --> 35:00.550
Cover our backs.

35:00.580 --> 35:04.720
So the Bloodpack's calling
the shots now, huh?

35:04.750 --> 35:06.930
Great.

35:08.850 --> 35:12.270
Better curb that dog of yours
or we'll do it for you.

35:15.810 --> 35:18.060
Keep pushing, asshole.

36:02.310 --> 36:04.280
We're in.

36:11.990 --> 36:14.620
You're about
to enter our world.

36:14.670 --> 36:17.800
You will see things--
feeding.

36:17.840 --> 36:20.680
Just remember
why you're here.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.920
I haven't forgotten.

36:35.860 --> 36:38.310
What exactly
are we looking for in here?

36:38.350 --> 36:41.400
Anything that looks
suspicious.

36:48.190 --> 36:50.750
You got to be
kidding me.

37:44.250 --> 37:47.020
Scud, do you read me?

37:49.890 --> 37:53.480
- Scud, you reading me?
- Reading you loud and clear.

37:53.560 --> 37:55.470
The whole place
is a safe house.

37:55.570 --> 37:57.990
The windows are painted black,
one access door.

37:58.060 --> 38:02.450
- 200, 300 suckheads in here.
- That sounds cool.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.820
Hey, W, you got me?

38:06.980 --> 38:08.960
W?

38:12.160 --> 38:14.990
Tell me something,
how's the weather up there?

38:15.080 --> 38:18.960
Walkin' on sunshine,
toad boy.

38:24.300 --> 38:26.640
Look at them.
Half of these bastards,

38:26.680 --> 38:29.480
they're not even
pure bloods.

38:29.520 --> 38:34.190
I tell you what, why don't we
just fucking kill everyone?

38:34.260 --> 38:35.980
Just to make sure.

38:40.150 --> 38:42.490
God, it would be
so easy.

38:59.040 --> 39:01.340
He's got you.

39:31.250 --> 39:33.920
Daywalker.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.360
Mother's milk.

40:50.440 --> 40:54.030
I say we got about half an hour
till sunrise, Cinderella.

40:54.130 --> 40:55.660
Hurry up.

41:13.480 --> 41:15.230
I spotted one,
but lost it.

41:15.310 --> 41:17.440
Be on the lookout.

41:26.570 --> 41:28.330
Fuck.

42:56.070 --> 42:58.550
Whistler, they're
on the roof.

42:58.590 --> 43:00.340
I got them on the roof
of my bus.

43:24.690 --> 43:26.620
Shhh.

44:27.390 --> 44:29.770
Nomak.

44:29.840 --> 44:32.470
Daywalker.

44:32.510 --> 44:35.340
What am I to you?

44:35.390 --> 44:38.430
Is the enemy
of my enemy my friend...

44:38.510 --> 44:40.600
or my enemy?

44:59.370 --> 45:00.700
We're under attack!

45:00.760 --> 45:02.630
There's three of them.
Probably more.

45:12.730 --> 45:14.310
Daylight.

46:58.240 --> 47:00.750
Silver don't do jack shit.
Don't waste the bullets!

47:00.830 --> 47:04.340
- Motherfucker.
- You hear me, Chupa?

47:04.410 --> 47:06.130
Say, "cheese."

47:23.360 --> 47:25.270
Come on.

48:04.030 --> 48:05.940
How about some daylight,
motherfucker?

50:02.400 --> 50:04.350
Fuck!

51:01.840 --> 51:04.960
Listen to me. If you're under attack,
use your UV lights.

51:05.040 --> 51:07.420
Use your UV lights.
They can't take the light.

51:56.640 --> 51:59.840
Priest?
We're not dying here.

51:59.940 --> 52:03.320
- Come on.
- Priest is down.

52:07.890 --> 52:11.270
Daylight's coming.
You're on your own, Blade.

52:35.300 --> 52:38.470
You want me so bad, Blade?

52:38.520 --> 52:40.650
Here I am.

52:43.190 --> 52:45.570
Why kill me?

52:47.700 --> 52:51.030
You and I,
we have the same enemy.

52:51.120 --> 52:52.770
We want the same thing.

54:31.640 --> 54:33.670
We need the same thing,
Blade.

55:26.400 --> 55:27.990
What happened?

55:28.060 --> 55:30.030
Why didn't you tell me
these things

55:30.070 --> 55:33.160
- were immune to silver and garlic?
- I didn't know.

55:33.240 --> 55:35.790
If you did,
would you have told me?

55:36.910 --> 55:39.960
I think you know the truth
when you hear it.

55:40.040 --> 55:42.200
Mm-hmm.
Then why didn't he kill you?

55:48.590 --> 55:50.540
How long since
he's been bitten?

55:50.580 --> 55:53.670
- About 20 minutes.
- His skin is fucking burning.

55:53.760 --> 55:55.890
He's already starting
to change.

55:58.920 --> 56:01.800
Will someone just
shut him the fuck up?

56:20.740 --> 56:22.570
Hold on!

56:22.660 --> 56:25.200
- Hold him, Chupa!
- Come on, man!

56:25.240 --> 56:27.080
Put him
out of his fucking misery!

56:28.760 --> 56:31.210
Don't you get it?
You can't finish him that way!

56:31.250 --> 56:33.840
Hold him down!
Hold him down, Chupa!

56:37.920 --> 56:39.340
Move.

56:43.360 --> 56:45.190
Back off!

56:58.110 --> 57:00.540
If that was
your Bloodpack Sunday punch,

57:00.610 --> 57:03.460
- we're in trouble.
- This motherfucker left his post.

57:03.530 --> 57:06.370
- He just disappeared.
- Where were you?

57:06.450 --> 57:08.540
Ran into a little Reaper
action myself.

57:08.630 --> 57:10.870
Oh, yeah?
How little?

57:10.970 --> 57:12.630
We lost a man.
Priest.

57:12.710 --> 57:15.970
You want me to carve
his name on your chest?

57:18.060 --> 57:19.130
Let me show you.

57:27.720 --> 57:30.140
Saw him moving in the alley
and followed it down.

57:30.240 --> 57:31.820
Found it just like this.

57:31.900 --> 57:34.310
I think they came through here.

57:34.410 --> 57:36.490
It was trying to crawl back
in the culvert.

57:36.580 --> 57:38.150
Caught his arm.

57:38.830 --> 57:41.500
Been gnawing at it
like a coyote.

57:43.580 --> 57:45.490
Little Boy Blue.

57:47.120 --> 57:49.160
It's already dying.

57:49.260 --> 57:52.000
I need to examine it
as quickly as possible.

57:53.580 --> 57:56.170
Okay, look for a lever.
Let's open it.

58:16.530 --> 58:19.650
They've made contact
with the Reapers.

58:19.700 --> 58:23.380
- Any casualties?
- One so far.

58:23.460 --> 58:25.660
It was not...

58:25.700 --> 58:28.000
Nyssa, I trust?

58:29.130 --> 58:30.170
No.

58:31.870 --> 58:34.790
This a dangerous game
you're playing, Damaskinos.

58:34.890 --> 58:36.840
Blade is too volatile.

58:36.880 --> 58:39.670
You're not going to be able
to keep manipulating him.

58:39.720 --> 58:41.340
You worry too much.

58:41.440 --> 58:43.850
I've been informed
by our friend inside

58:43.890 --> 58:46.070
that events are unfolding
as scripted.

58:46.150 --> 58:48.100
You've already lost
one of your own.

58:48.190 --> 58:50.240
How many more are you
willing to sacrifice?

58:52.570 --> 58:54.200
Everyone.

58:54.240 --> 58:55.830
Even your own
daughter?

58:59.660 --> 59:02.450
Yes. Even her.

59:11.580 --> 59:13.550
Recognize this?

59:13.630 --> 59:15.170
The blood bank.

59:15.210 --> 59:16.960
He's one of the guards.

59:17.050 --> 59:19.430
So why is he dying?
What's killing him?

59:20.590 --> 59:22.560
Time.

59:22.600 --> 59:24.800
His metabolism
is burning too fast.

59:26.100 --> 59:28.470
They need fresh blood
every couple of hours,

59:28.570 --> 59:31.310
or they'll start feeding
on themselves.

59:31.390 --> 59:33.320
Nomak's different.

59:33.400 --> 59:36.610
He's the carrier.
It all started with him.

59:36.700 --> 59:38.320
It'll end with him.

01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:05.360
Open the mouth, Scud.

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:09.030
Open the mouth.

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:10.610
B, come on.

01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:13.350
Sissy.

01:00:29.790 --> 01:00:32.370
Only the tongue
carries the virus.

01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:35.050
It is injected
through these barbs.

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.920
It has bifurcated
masseter muscles.

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:43.260
Overdeveloped, allowing
for a much stronger bite.

01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:47.570
The jaw structure
remains the same.

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:50.740
But there's
no mandible bone.

01:00:50.810 --> 01:00:52.690
Squeeze that tooth.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.040
Neurotoxin.

01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:07.830
Probably paralyzes
their victim

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.120
while they feed.

01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:16.010
Garlic don't work.
Silver, that don't work.

01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:17.890
We got to go
with the sunlight, right?

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.230
That's deadly to us, too.

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.730
So let's see what else
we can find.

01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:51.330
These things are
as different from us

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:53.870
as we are from you.

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.010
Look at that.

01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:02.840
The heart
is encased in bone.

01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:05.180
Only the side
is vulnerable.

01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:07.360
Good luck getting
a stake through that.

01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:10.490
Pull a leg off a spider,
it keeps moving on its own,

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.520
essentially trying to walk
without a body attached to it.

01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:17.360
- What are you doing?
- Hard-wired, right?

01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:25.080
What the fuck is that?

01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:28.750
Brain's dead.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.260
Body's still trying
to feed.

01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:34.220
We got six hours
before sunrise.

01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:35.850
Be ready by then.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.050
Hey...

01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:40.050
What happens
at sunrise?

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.900
Blade,
I'm talking to you.

01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:45.900
What happens
at sunrise?

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:49.970
- We hunt.
- In broad daylight?

01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:52.150
You got be joking.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:54.820
You better get you
some sunscreen, buttercup.

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.120
Listen, shitkicker.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.950
You're about one cunt hair
away from hillbilly heaven.

01:02:58.990 --> 01:03:01.580
I love it
when you talk dirty.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.090
Sunlight's the only
edge we've got.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:10.170
- They'll be more vulnerable then.
- And so will we.

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:14.170
Let's be real
about one thing--

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:18.220
I don't expect everybody
to make it back tomorrow.

01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:21.800
Remember to protect
yourselves...

01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:23.840
at all times.

01:03:31.610 --> 01:03:33.150
What are you looking for?

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.200
Phosphor rods.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:38.120
If I can suss out the light source
maybe I can make some sort of

01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:41.030
UV flash-bang grenade
or something.

01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:42.790
It's been tried already.

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:45.780
Yeah, but you didn't have
the Scudster working on it then.

01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:00.560
- Blade.
- Hmm?

01:04:00.590 --> 01:04:03.850
- The way you talk to them-- us.
- What is it?

01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:06.190
We are together
in this, remember?

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.470
Why do you hate us
so much?

01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:11.400
It's fate.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:15.070
- It's in my blood.
- It's in mine, too.

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:17.660
I'm a pure blood.
I was born a vampire.

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:25.450
You know the thirst
better than any of us,

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:27.530
shooting that serum
of yours.

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:29.380
The only difference
between us,

01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:33.210
is that I made peace with
what I am a long time ago.

01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:42.550
How long have
you known Blade, anyway?

01:04:42.590 --> 01:04:44.310
Going on 20 years.

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:47.230
He doesn't talk about
the old days that much.

01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:49.390
Blade doesn't talk
about anything much.

01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:52.730
You want to hear
something funny?

01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:55.900
Blade kind of looks at you
like a father figure.

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.740
Tell me something.

01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:01.200
How'd you two hook up?

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.830
I was backpacking.

01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:06.280
I met these two chicks,
decided to take them back

01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:09.950
to my tent for a little
"Three's Company" action.

01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:12.170
- Pretty.
- Next thing I know, Janet and Chrissy

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:14.120
start tearing chunks
out of my stomach.

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:17.250
Blade shows up,
saves my ass.

01:05:17.290 --> 01:05:19.720
Everything else just sort of
fell into place.

01:05:22.890 --> 01:05:25.380
- Let's try it.
- All right.

01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:40.120
Maybe I fucked up.
Maybe you were right.

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:46.920
All right.

01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:49.460
Papa's got
a brand new bag.

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:31.210
Let me ask one question.

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:33.550
How are we going to find
these Reapers?

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:35.380
We won't have to.

01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:36.890
They'll come to us.

01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:44.180
- What is this shit?
- Pheromones.

01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:46.850
Harvested from the Reapers'
adrenal glands.

01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:48.900
They're going to key to it.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:54.810
They want us to spray on
some suckpuppy's nut juice?

01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:58.530
First use your firearms
to drive them back.

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.870
- Then toss your UV grenades.
- Right on.

01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:03.000
This is what we got
for the grand finale.

01:07:03.070 --> 01:07:04.750
I hot-wired a couple
of these babies

01:07:04.830 --> 01:07:07.170
into a nitro-vacuum.

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.660
Just be real careful
where you pop your load.

01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:12.090
And you,
you're not coming?

01:07:12.130 --> 01:07:15.010
No. I'm a lover,
not a fighter.

01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:18.500
UV's have
a 10-second delay.

01:07:20.090 --> 01:07:22.020
Nyssa...

01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:24.170
just remember
to take cover.

01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:29.520
Hey, Blade, give me a hand.

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:37.200
You and Miss Muffet
getting a little cozy?

01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:40.690
I wouldn't worry
about that if I were you.

01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:42.690
Looks to me like you're
getting confused

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:45.210
as to which side of the line
you're standing on.

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:48.880
Those are real hollow words
coming from a man

01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:52.050
who just spent two years
running with the enemy.

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:54.550
And what the hell
is that supposed to mean?

01:07:56.970 --> 01:07:59.880
You know, Whistler,
there's an old saying--

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.300
"Keep your friends close,

01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:05.130
but keep your enemies closer."

01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:07.260
You might want
to remember that.

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:34.510
Blade, we should split
into three units.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.540
We're trying
to attract them,

01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:50.200
not scare them off.

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:52.710
Yeah, well, some of us
can't see in the dark,

01:09:52.750 --> 01:09:56.210
you fucking nipplehead.
What am I supposed to do?

01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:58.750
Bifocals, grandpa.
And try to keep up.

01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:57.940
Let's do this.

01:11:03.730 --> 01:11:06.860
- Hey, hillbilly.
- What the fuck you doing?

01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:10.840
Ain't nobody here
but you...

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:13.370
and us, buttercup.

01:11:16.050 --> 01:11:18.890
We lose a partner,
and Blade loses one!

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.510
I'll leave you two lovebirds
some time to yourselves.

01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:41.260
Ah!

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:06.860
I spotted a group
in the east tunnel.

01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:08.870
I'm prepping
the bomb pack.

01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:10.880
Nyssa.

01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:34.640
Get out!

01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:37.400
Right now!

01:13:40.810 --> 01:13:42.400
No!

01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:47.410
No!

01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:52.740
I'll attract them to me.
Do what I tell you.

01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:54.410
Move!

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.660
10...

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.250
nine...

01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:01.890
eight...

01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:03.880
seven...

01:14:03.970 --> 01:14:05.600
six...

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:08.310
five...

01:14:08.350 --> 01:14:10.680
four...

01:14:10.730 --> 01:14:12.680
three...

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:14.260
two...

01:14:17.190 --> 01:14:18.530
one.

01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:45.000
Piece of junk.

01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:00.860
What the hell is this?

01:15:02.150 --> 01:15:04.730
You trying to stink me
to death, old man?

01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:17.050
Wait.

01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:20.590
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:22.420
We got to move.

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.130
We got a lot
of company.

01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:30.220
All units, regroup.
Regroup!

01:15:56.410 --> 01:15:59.080
Eat shit,
you ugly motherfuckers!

01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:04.250
There's nobody left!

01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:26.410
- Where's the bomb pack?
- Down that tunnel.

01:16:26.490 --> 01:16:29.080
Give me the rest
of the pheromones.

01:16:31.410 --> 01:16:33.320
Go down that tunnel!

01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:35.210
Go, go, go, go!

01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:38.300
You obviously...

01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:40.670
do not know...

01:16:40.710 --> 01:16:42.680
whom you are fucking with!

01:17:17.790 --> 01:17:19.470
By the way, Blade.

01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:22.680
Did I happen to mention
the bomb lever is stuck?

01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:30.170
Suck this!

01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:34.190
Let's go!

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:17.270
You want a bite of me?
Well, come on!

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.810
Come on, motherfucker!

01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:39.940
Whistler.

01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:41.900
Wait.

01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:44.270
You will survive this

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.990
only to tell Blade...

01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:49.080
about this ring.

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:51.370
About the truth.

01:19:51.450 --> 01:19:53.610
The truth, old man.

01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:57.870
Damaskinos...

01:20:05.970 --> 01:20:07.890
Nyssa.

01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:37.930
You've done
a great job.

01:21:39.650 --> 01:21:42.450
Not that great--
I'd say.

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:08.390
What is it,
my daughter?

01:22:57.860 --> 01:22:59.180
They took them.

01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:01.730
All our weapons.
Even your sword.

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:04.350
Somebody's been keeping tabs
on us from inside.

01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:07.200
- Where are we?
- Some kind of chamber

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:08.990
deep in their lair.

01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:11.040
They smashed up
everything--

01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:13.200
the workshop,
all of it.

01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:17.910
They've been lying
to us from day one.

01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:21.010
The reaper strain
didn't evolve...

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.580
it was designed.

01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:24.370
What?

01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:26.750
Designed.
Nomak told me.

01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:28.540
I saw him back
in the sewer.

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:31.930
- He let me live.
- Did he?

01:23:32.010 --> 01:23:34.560
How generous of him.

01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:38.070
I brought you here to see
the fruits of our labor.

01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:44.320
For years I've struggled

01:23:44.410 --> 01:23:49.080
to rid our kind of
any hereditary weaknesses.

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:53.030
And so, recombining DNA...

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:55.880
was simply the next
logical step.

01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:00.120
Nomak was the first.

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:02.290
A failure.

01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:04.050
But in time,

01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:07.390
there will be a new
pure race,

01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:09.760
begotten from my own flesh,

01:24:09.810 --> 01:24:12.840
immune to silver,

01:24:12.930 --> 01:24:15.930
soon even sunlight.

01:24:15.970 --> 01:24:19.320
I got a question for you,
you lying son of a bitch.

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:22.100
You want to explain how Nomak
got ahold of this ring?

01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:36.080
I would have thought
that was obvious at this point.

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:38.090
I gave it to him,
of course.

01:24:38.170 --> 01:24:41.090
A gift from father
to son.

01:24:52.260 --> 01:24:54.970
I thought
he'd never leave.

01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:03.270
The wolf has lain
with the sheep long enough.

01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:05.520
Reinhardt,

01:25:05.610 --> 01:25:08.370
you can kiss
your ass goodbye.

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:18.090
I'm sorry, man.

01:25:18.170 --> 01:25:20.080
B, you're wasting
your time, man.

01:25:20.170 --> 01:25:21.880
The bomb's a dud.

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:23.710
It was never supposed
to explode.

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:26.290
It was just supposed
to make you feel in control.

01:25:26.370 --> 01:25:29.220
You thought you had me
on a short leash,

01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:30.960
didn't you, jefe?

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.150
Much better.

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:44.820
See this?

01:25:46.650 --> 01:25:48.990
I'm one of Damaskinos'
familiars.

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:51.690
They needed my help
to bring you here to control Nomak.

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:54.080
The old fuck,
he was always just bait.

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.910
I mean, look at him.

01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:57.750
He's your only
real weakness, man.

01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:59.580
You may be fast,
you may be strong,

01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:01.240
and all that other
bullshit,

01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:02.750
but in the end, B...

01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:04.550
you're just too human!

01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:07.880
Well, you little shit.

01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:15.060
You think they scoped out
my security system?

01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:17.230
I let them in, asshole!

01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:20.230
I practically
handed them the keys.

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:22.190
You heard cue ball, right?

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:25.060
Pretty soon they're all going
to be daywalkers.

01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:26.910
When that happens,

01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:28.860
I'd rather be a pet
than cattle.

01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:30.530
You got me, B?

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:36.000
- What do you think about that?
- Two things--

01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:38.080
one...

01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:41.950
I've been onto you
since they turned you.

01:26:42.050 --> 01:26:43.960
And two...

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:47.300
it's not a dud.

01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:49.850
Ah, great.

01:26:58.140 --> 01:27:00.510
I was just starting
to like him.

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:02.310
Take him down!

01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:37.720
We're going to harvest
your blood,

01:27:37.810 --> 01:27:39.220
every drop of it.

01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:43.470
Then bone marrow,
organs, everything.

01:27:43.530 --> 01:27:45.390
We'll find
the missing key

01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:47.480
to creating daywalkers.

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:56.990
Now this
might hurt a bit.

01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:02.660
Nice.

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:06.180
I wonder...

01:28:06.250 --> 01:28:09.720
how many vampires
he's killed with this thing.

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:11.590
Not nearly enough, Fritz.

01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:14.810
Keep talking, honky-tonk.

01:28:14.890 --> 01:28:17.560
Just makes my sending you
to the next world

01:28:17.650 --> 01:28:21.190
- all the sweeter.
- Been there, done that.

01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:23.740
Do your worst,
chickenshit.

01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:25.600
We'll settle up after.

01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:49.670
What else
should I find out?

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.390
I trusted you--

01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:54.920
with my men;

01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:57.060
with my will;

01:28:57.140 --> 01:28:59.090
with my life.

01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:04.070
You sent us out there.

01:29:06.530 --> 01:29:08.350
You sent me to die.

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:13.530
Our enemy saved
my life twice,

01:29:13.610 --> 01:29:18.200
and you have used us--
your own children.

01:29:19.710 --> 01:29:21.800
Make no mistake, Nyssa,

01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:25.080
those blood ties
mean nothing to me

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:27.670
when measured against
the ascendancy of our race.

01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:33.800
Who do you think
God really favors in the web?

01:29:36.510 --> 01:29:39.640
The spider, or the fly?

01:29:44.490 --> 01:29:46.390
Nomak.

01:29:51.650 --> 01:29:53.650
What about him?

01:29:53.730 --> 01:29:56.780
He wants revenge...

01:29:56.860 --> 01:29:59.830
on the people...

01:29:59.910 --> 01:30:02.160
who created him.

01:30:02.250 --> 01:30:04.920
You may be right.

01:30:05.010 --> 01:30:07.630
But fortunately
for us,

01:30:07.710 --> 01:30:09.790
he doesn't know
this location.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.480
Now... he does.

01:30:45.550 --> 01:30:47.460
What the fuck?

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:42.810
Come on, kid.

01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:45.730
Don't you even think
about dying on me.

01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:51.480
You didn't give up on me,
I won't give up on you.

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:53.490
Come on-- Blade.

01:32:01.710 --> 01:32:04.580
Blood...

01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:06.920
Yeah.

01:32:06.970 --> 01:32:08.930
Blood.

01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:46.410
Father!

01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:48.410
He'll never enter here.

01:32:55.670 --> 01:32:57.560
Father!

01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:24.750
Father!

01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:54.610
Go on, kid.

01:33:57.740 --> 01:33:58.960
Go!

01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:19.310
Get him!

01:36:32.410 --> 01:36:33.780
Get in there!

01:36:48.510 --> 01:36:51.920
Hmm. Well...

01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:54.920
like my daddy said
before he killed my mom,

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.930
"You want anything
done right,

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.590
you got to do it
yourself."

01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:04.230
He also said--

01:37:20.450 --> 01:37:22.420
Can you blush?

01:37:36.430 --> 01:37:38.100
Hey, kid.

01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:20.510
I reset
the security code.

01:38:21.970 --> 01:38:25.400
- We're locked in.
- Are you insane?

01:38:27.310 --> 01:38:29.740
- He'll kill us both.
- Yes.

01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:35.240
Isn't it sad that you die not
by the hand of your enemy,

01:38:36.650 --> 01:38:38.580
but by that of your own
children?

01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:50.380
Father.

01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:26.260
Nyssa.

01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:17.950
Nomak!

01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:24.880
Blade,
it could end right here.

01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:27.120
What do you think, huh?

01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:25.270
After all,

01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:28.270
it looks like I've finished
my father's job.

01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:32.620
It's strange.

01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:34.330
It hurts...

01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:36.920
it hurts no more.

01:46:36.030 --> 01:46:38.120
It won't be long.

01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:42.450
I can already feel it
burning inside of me.

01:46:46.370 --> 01:46:49.630
I want to die
while I'm still a vampire.

01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:05.390
I want to see the sun.

01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:41.620
By booth number three.

01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:43.290
Enjoy, man.

01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:53.300
Are you sure
that the girls are live?

01:48:53.330 --> 01:48:55.120
Last time I checked.

01:48:55.170 --> 01:48:56.930
Thank you.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.790
A couple of razor blades,
just in case...

01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:10.680
You didn't think I forgot
about you, did you?
