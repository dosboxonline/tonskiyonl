[ominous music plays]

00:33.833 --> 00:35.166
It's Christmas Eve.

00:36.958 --> 00:38.791
- [music fades]
- [phone line rings]

00:39.916 --> 00:42.290
- [Reed] <i>Helen.</i>
- [Helen] <i>You sent a teenager to kill me.</i>

00:42.291 --> 00:43.958
<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

00:45.791 --> 00:48.332
Well, you can't be upset
or particularly surprised.

00:48.333 --> 00:50.374
I actually can be
both of those fucking things.

00:50.375 --> 00:53.374
[Reed] <i>You've been half out of the door
for months, since Jason.</i>

00:53.375 --> 00:56.374
<i>This has been coming.
I tried to fix it. I brought in Sam.</i>

00:56.375 --> 00:57.832
<i>I supported you,</i>

00:57.833 --> 01:01.040
but now you've both proven to me
that you're unreliable.

01:01.041 --> 01:02.499
[Helen] <i>Come after me if you want.</i>

01:02.500 --> 01:05.707
Next time, send somebody more competent
than the work experience girl.

01:05.708 --> 01:07.708
But leave Sam out of this. He's loyal.

01:09.458 --> 01:12.624
I gave him the opportunity
to show his loyalty last night.

01:12.625 --> 01:13.790
What do you mean?

01:13.791 --> 01:16.165
[Reed] <i>I gave him
Alex Clark's home address</i>

01:16.166 --> 01:17.916
<i>and a chance to end all of this.</i>

01:18.875 --> 01:20.457
But he couldn't even do that.

01:20.458 --> 01:23.082
You sent Sam on his own to the Clarks?

01:23.083 --> 01:24.374
[Reed] <i>I gave him the address</i>

01:24.375 --> 01:26.750
<i>and an opportunity to show
that you were still both</i>

01:28.458 --> 01:29.458
team players.

01:30.083 --> 01:31.458
[Helen] <i>What have you done?</i>

01:33.291 --> 01:36.540
<i>You need to give me that address.
If anything has happened to him, I'll--</i>

01:36.541 --> 01:38.750
Now, let me give you one last chance.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.040
Bring me the recording device.

01:42.041 --> 01:44.832
If the Clarks have Sam,
then it's the only leverage I've got.

01:44.833 --> 01:47.457
[Reed] <i>Let me be very clear
what we're talking about here.</i>

01:47.458 --> 01:51.457
<i>It's the life of your friend versus
de-escalating two nuclear superpowers</i>

01:51.458 --> 01:53.499
<i>from taking lumps out of each other.</i>

01:53.500 --> 01:56.625
Now, as a moral quandary,
it would barely trouble a child.

01:57.125 --> 01:59.665
I like Sam, I always have,
but that's just what it is.

01:59.666 --> 02:03.458
These are the dice we play with.
And he knows that better than most.

02:04.708 --> 02:07.957
<i>I cannot protect everyone
if I'm not in control.</i>

02:07.958 --> 02:11.125
<i>And right now, you're not letting me
feel like I'm in control.</i>

02:14.625 --> 02:15.541
<i>Helen.</i>

02:16.083 --> 02:17.250
Maybe you're not.

02:19.166 --> 02:19.999
Damn it.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.708
[tense music plays]

[exhales]

02:31.125 --> 02:32.708
[tense music continues]

02:47.791 --> 02:49.832
[Helen] <i>They murdered Jason.</i>

02:49.833 --> 02:51.791
<i>And Maggie and Phillip
and Commissioner Yarrick.</i>

02:53.083 --> 02:55.833
<i>They sent a man to my house.
He threatened my children.</i>

02:57.625 --> 02:59.874
<i>And I'm going to kill
the people who sent him.</i>

02:59.875 --> 03:01.625
[tense music continues]

03:08.125 --> 03:09.624
[phone line rings]

03:09.625 --> 03:11.582
[Helen] <i>Williams, I know
how to find Trent Clark.</i>

03:11.583 --> 03:14.624
<i>Be downstairs in ten minutes.
Let's go get our friends back.</i>

03:14.625 --> 03:16.166
[tense music continues]

03:26.541 --> 03:28.124
- How are you?
- [music fades]

03:28.125 --> 03:29.083
[Williams groans]

03:30.625 --> 03:31.624
[Helen] How's your wound?

03:31.625 --> 03:34.374
Yeah, bit lightheaded from the blood loss,
but toast is helping.

03:34.375 --> 03:37.499
Okay, did Sam tell you where he was going?
Did he give you an address?

03:37.500 --> 03:39.207
No, I was unconscious.

03:39.208 --> 03:41.625
[Helen] We need to meet the Clarks
with this at midday then.

03:42.833 --> 03:43.875
[Williams] You got it.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.208
D'you know, it's probably a trap though.

03:46.708 --> 03:49.875
Those Clark fuckers probably have
the place rigged like a shooting gallery.

03:51.291 --> 03:52.749
I think we can still surprise them.

03:52.750 --> 03:54.708
- [engine starts, revs]
- [music ends]

03:57.208 --> 03:58.250
[groans]

03:58.916 --> 03:59.750
[sighs]

04:00.458 --> 04:02.291
[Eleanor] What's your favorite
Christmas film?

04:03.500 --> 04:04.333
[Sam strains]

04:05.750 --> 04:06.750
<i>The Santa Clause.</i>

04:07.375 --> 04:08.208
[Sam groans]

04:08.708 --> 04:09.708
<i>Santa Clause</i>?

04:11.291 --> 04:12.625
The... Oh.

04:13.125 --> 04:16.165
Um, that's the one
where he gets shoved off the roof

04:16.166 --> 04:17.915
and he's gotta be
the new Father Christmas.

04:17.916 --> 04:20.499
- Yeah.
- Yes, I love <i>The Santa Clause</i>!

04:20.500 --> 04:22.665
[Sam grunting]

04:22.666 --> 04:23.666
What about you?

04:25.375 --> 04:26.749
- Oi.
- What?

04:26.750 --> 04:28.250
[Eleanor] Favorite Christmas film?

04:29.166 --> 04:33.125
I'm... I'm a little bit busy right now,
trying to get us out of here.

04:34.333 --> 04:36.416
[sarcastically] Well,
you're doing a really good job.

04:36.958 --> 04:39.207
Look at all the progress you're making.
Look at that.

04:39.208 --> 04:42.500
[Sam] If we're not out of here by midday,
we're dead. [grunts]

04:43.458 --> 04:45.458
[chair creaking]

04:47.708 --> 04:48.666
<i>The Holiday.</i>

04:49.791 --> 04:52.332
Um, whats-her-face,
Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet?

04:52.333 --> 04:56.249
- [Sam] Yes.
- Yeah, fucking... That's a shit film!

04:56.250 --> 04:59.707
That's shit. Did you used to watch that
with your boyfriend?

04:59.708 --> 05:01.291
- Yeah.
- [Eleanor] Yeah.

05:01.875 --> 05:04.000
[chuckles] That's a really nice memory.

05:05.458 --> 05:06.333
Yeah.

05:07.541 --> 05:10.875
I watched that one with my boyfriend.
I hope he's okay.

05:18.041 --> 05:19.250
Yeah, he'll be fine.

05:22.458 --> 05:24.458
[metallic rattling]

05:33.958 --> 05:34.958
[Helen] Trent Clark?

05:35.625 --> 05:37.166
[horses neigh]

05:38.708 --> 05:41.125
- [Trent] Can I help you?
- We're looking for your mother.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.832
[Trent on phone] <i>Mum.
Yeah, hi. It's me. Yeah.</i>

05:47.833 --> 05:51.749
<i>Um, I... I've messed up.
I've</i>... <i>I've really, really messed up.</i>

05:51.750 --> 05:53.457
[tense music plays]

05:53.458 --> 05:55.875
- [exhales]
- Can you give her a call?

05:57.291 --> 06:00.082
- I can't do that.
- You're gonna have to fucking do that.

06:00.083 --> 06:01.833
Because your mother has Kai-Ming,

06:02.583 --> 06:03.665
and she's gonna hurt her.

06:03.666 --> 06:04.583
[scoffs]

06:05.083 --> 06:07.249
- You're lying.
- I think you know we're not.

06:07.250 --> 06:09.165
You know exactly
what your mother is capable of.

06:09.166 --> 06:10.875
Maybe that's why you're so scared of her.

06:11.375 --> 06:15.124
- If you don't call her, Kai-Ming will die.
- [Trent sighs]

06:15.125 --> 06:17.707
And you're not gonna let that happen
because you love her.

06:17.708 --> 06:20.125
And you'll do anything
for the people you love.

06:21.041 --> 06:21.916
Anything.

06:26.458 --> 06:27.957
- [Williams] Hm.
- [Trent exhales]

06:27.958 --> 06:28.875
Good man.

06:34.458 --> 06:35.750
[phone line rings]

06:37.125 --> 06:37.999
[Alex] <i>Hello, darling.</i>

06:38.000 --> 06:40.582
<i>I'm just on my way to Waitrose
to get a few bits for tomorrow.</i>

06:40.583 --> 06:41.582
<i>Are you okay?</i>

06:41.583 --> 06:43.000
Hello, Alex.

06:43.625 --> 06:45.999
Whether he's okay or not
remains to be seen.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.250
[Alex] <i>Who's this?</i>

06:48.416 --> 06:52.208
The drop-off is in one hour.
You're going to be there in person.

06:52.708 --> 06:55.665
And if you're not,
or if we're walking into a trap,

06:55.666 --> 06:58.875
or if my friends are hurt
in any permanent way,

06:59.708 --> 07:02.500
then that is gonna be very bad news
for Trent here.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.790
- Is that clear?
- [Alex] <i>Yes.</i>

07:04.791 --> 07:05.790
Good.

07:05.791 --> 07:08.333
And just... not for nothing,

07:09.375 --> 07:12.125
I'm gonna be very fucking glad
to meet you face-to-face.

07:12.708 --> 07:15.083
I've got a lot of questions
that need answering.

07:17.916 --> 07:19.082
[Williams trills lips]

07:19.083 --> 07:20.166
Waitrose.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.041
[tense music plays]

07:30.041 --> 07:32.082
You don't seem like a mob boss's son.

07:32.083 --> 07:33.583
My mother's not a mob boss.

07:34.750 --> 07:35.833
She's a, um...

07:38.916 --> 07:41.250
criminally adjacent person of influence.

07:43.166 --> 07:44.540
Right.

07:44.541 --> 07:47.374
I'm not like my mum.
I'm... I'm not like any of them.

07:47.375 --> 07:50.208
You are a drug dealer
and a murderer though.

07:51.750 --> 07:54.457
- If we're handing out labels.
- I... I'm not... I'm not a drug dealer.

07:54.458 --> 07:55.416
I just...

07:57.333 --> 08:00.875
I knew that... I knew Kai was into
that stuff, so I would get it for her.

08:02.666 --> 08:05.041
I... I wanted her to...

08:06.708 --> 08:07.541
[sighs]

08:08.958 --> 08:10.000
[Williams] To like you?

08:10.500 --> 08:12.207
[sighs] Yeah.

08:12.208 --> 08:14.540
Well, Trent,
the next time you like a girl,

08:14.541 --> 08:16.790
maybe try just talking to her
about her interests

08:16.791 --> 08:19.625
instead of seeing
if you can buy her affection with heroin.

08:21.041 --> 08:22.916
I'll try and remember that. Thank you.

08:26.625 --> 08:27.833
Doesn't matter anyway.

08:29.583 --> 08:32.125
I might not be a drug dealer,
but I am a murderer.

08:34.833 --> 08:36.082
I deserve everything I get.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.291
Well, now's your chance to make up for it.

08:39.083 --> 08:41.208
You're gonna help us save Kai-Ming's life.

08:46.041 --> 08:47.958
She probably still won't shag you though.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.374
[Jacqueline] This where
the prime minister lives?

08:52.375 --> 08:53.290
[Wallace] This is it.

08:53.291 --> 08:54.832
- [kids] Ooh!
- [reporter] Mr. Webb!

08:54.833 --> 08:56.707
[Wallace] Don't pay any attention to them.

08:56.708 --> 08:59.082
<i>Helen, I've had to bring the children
into Downing Street,</i>

08:59.083 --> 09:00.499
<i>and there are cameras everywhere.</i>

09:00.500 --> 09:02.707
They're gonna end up
on bloody <i>Newsnight</i> at this rate.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.165
So can you give me a call back
when you get this? Thank you.

09:05.166 --> 09:07.250
- [breathing heavily]
- [tense music plays]

09:15.875 --> 09:19.540
The recording of Ambassador Chen's murder,
which you've been hoping exists,

09:19.541 --> 09:22.082
has been found and verified

09:22.083 --> 09:23.915
and is about to switch hands.

[tense music continues]

09:34.166 --> 09:35.083
[car lock beeps]

09:37.166 --> 09:39.083
I hope, for the good of everyone,

09:39.958 --> 09:42.624
that you are able
to act swiftly, Mr. Porter.

09:42.625 --> 09:45.625
[Mitch] <i>I'm glad we could be

09:46.333 --> 09:47.415
[elevator dings]

09:47.416 --> 09:49.957
What the hell happened?
I've got everyone out looking for you.

09:49.958 --> 09:50.874
It's a long story.

09:50.875 --> 09:52.207
Yeah, I can't wait to hear it,

09:52.208 --> 09:54.374
but we just got the address
of an intel exchange.

09:54.375 --> 09:56.332
The Clarks. Borough Market.

09:56.333 --> 09:57.915
Yeah. How did you know?

09:57.916 --> 10:00.499
We need to get there before Beijing does.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.791
- You got a gun?
- No.

10:02.541 --> 10:03.707
We'll get you one.

It's all gonna be okay.

11:21.083 --> 11:21.916
All right?

Everything's gonna be fine.

Remember I said
it should be every woman for herself?

12:16.083 --> 12:18.457
Yeah, I do.
And it was very hurtful, actually.

12:18.458 --> 12:22.000
Well, I decided that was a stupid thing
to say, and, uh, I didn't mean it.

12:22.875 --> 12:25.332
- Thank you.
- I was trying to keep you out of this.

12:25.333 --> 12:28.375
[grunts, sighs] Well, this wasn't
your thing to keep me out of.

12:29.208 --> 12:31.040
- Thank you.
- [Sam] We need to go.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.833
[Helen] Not before I find Alex Clark.

12:33.333 --> 12:35.540
[Sam] Helen, I'll deal with her.
I have to keep you safe.

12:35.541 --> 12:38.958
Let's just... let's just get out of here.
Come on. We need to go.

12:39.833 --> 12:40.666
[music fades]

12:43.041 --> 12:45.250
[Alex] I'm afraid
you can't leave just yet.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.415
This meeting is an exchange, remember?

12:53.416 --> 12:54.624
[Trent] Mum.

12:54.625 --> 12:55.707
Are you all right?

12:55.708 --> 12:58.540
- They haven't harmed you?
- What were you gonna do with Kai-Ming?

12:58.541 --> 13:02.249
Oh, he's a good boy,
but cunt-struck, alas.

13:02.250 --> 13:04.832
Absolutely irredeemably so.

13:04.833 --> 13:07.333
And look at the trouble
it's gotten us all into.

13:09.500 --> 13:10.832
[sighs] You're Helen Webb?

13:10.833 --> 13:12.624
You're Alex Clark.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.000
In the flesh, as requested.

13:15.833 --> 13:16.791
The device?

13:23.291 --> 13:26.583
- You've watched it. Is it like he said?
- [Helen] He pushed him.

13:27.791 --> 13:29.833
The ambassador fell and hit his head.

13:30.750 --> 13:32.375
- It was an accident.
- [Alex tuts]

13:32.916 --> 13:35.457
[scoffs] Well, everything he's ever done
has been an accident.

13:35.458 --> 13:37.083
Trent, what is she talking about?

13:37.916 --> 13:38.833
I'm sorry, Kai.

13:40.416 --> 13:42.708
- I didn't mean for it to happen.
- [man 1] But it did.

13:43.208 --> 13:45.958
And we continue to deal with the fallout.

13:46.833 --> 13:47.707
[tense music plays]

13:47.708 --> 13:50.125
[chuckles] You're the voice on the phone.

13:51.083 --> 13:52.040
Yes.

13:52.041 --> 13:55.000
It's funny. I... I thought
that you'd bring more protection.

13:56.083 --> 13:58.499
Well, this isn't a room full of people
that get intimidated

13:58.500 --> 14:01.041
by big men with big guns, is it?

14:01.625 --> 14:03.666
But here's what I do have.

14:04.666 --> 14:08.707
The shared knowledge with you
that if something were to happen to me,

14:08.708 --> 14:11.832
then the consequences
would be bubonic in nature.

14:11.833 --> 14:16.416
Total fucking carnage for anyone involved.

14:17.125 --> 14:18.166
Do you understand?

14:19.791 --> 14:21.208
Now, let me see that tape.

14:25.208 --> 14:26.166
[bag unzips]

14:27.041 --> 14:28.415
[objects clunk]

14:28.416 --> 14:30.500
[tense music continues]

14:35.791 --> 14:38.166
- All right?
- The Americans think there's a tape.

14:38.791 --> 14:41.875
- What? What tape?
- A tape. A recording of Chen's murder.

14:43.041 --> 14:44.583
- What? Exonerating them?
- Yeah.

14:45.250 --> 14:46.290
Fuck.

14:46.291 --> 14:48.332
[tense music continues]

14:48.333 --> 14:51.124
<i>I know who you are, Trent Clark.</i>

14:51.125 --> 14:53.665
<i>I won't have you
polluting my daughter anymore.</i>

14:53.666 --> 14:54.791
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

14:55.958 --> 14:58.499
<i>If I see you ever again,</i>

14:58.500 --> 15:00.165
<i>I will kill you.</i>

15:00.166 --> 15:01.749
[tense music continues]

15:01.750 --> 15:02.666
[Chen grunts]

15:03.208 --> 15:04.499
[music fades]

15:04.500 --> 15:05.749
All right, that's enough.

15:05.750 --> 15:06.708
[Kai-Ming gasps]

15:13.083 --> 15:14.040
- Yes, okay.
- [knocking]

15:14.041 --> 15:15.957
Yep, come in.
All right, I'll call you later.

15:15.958 --> 15:18.665
The Americans are saying
there's a tape of Chen's death.

15:18.666 --> 15:21.500
They're saying it could throw cold water
on this whole thing.

15:23.291 --> 15:24.166
Tape.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.375
- A recording?
- [Bill] They're on their way to get it.

15:28.875 --> 15:30.665
Are they asking for, uh, police support?

15:30.666 --> 15:33.707
They're not asking for anything.
They're telling us to get outta their way.

15:33.708 --> 15:35.249
Right. Mm-hmm.

15:35.250 --> 15:36.333
Keep me updated.

15:36.833 --> 15:39.040
Every five minutes. Yes?

15:39.041 --> 15:40.749
Uh, y-yes.

15:40.750 --> 15:41.875
[cell phone buzzes]

15:43.208 --> 15:44.415
We need to leave.

15:44.416 --> 15:45.375
Well,

15:46.666 --> 15:48.457
I'm glad this worked out for everyone.

15:48.458 --> 15:51.791
- Worked out for everyone?
- We all got what we wanted, didn't we?

15:52.375 --> 15:53.415
Happy Christmas.

15:53.416 --> 15:55.082
- Happy Christmas.
- Happy Christmas.

15:55.083 --> 15:56.415
I didn't get what I wanted.

15:56.416 --> 15:57.790
[ominous music plays]

15:57.791 --> 16:00.165
Your friends are alive.
No one died. Take the victory.

16:00.166 --> 16:01.875
Not all of them are alive.

16:03.375 --> 16:04.207
[Alex] No?

16:04.208 --> 16:06.915
Well, that's the price of doing business,
isn't it, unfortunately.

16:06.916 --> 16:10.124
I hope you remember that
if we ever run into each other again.

16:10.125 --> 16:12.457
- [Sam] Helen.
- The price? But you haven't paid anything.

16:12.458 --> 16:15.124
- Helen.
- I paid with my time and my money.

16:15.125 --> 16:19.040
And my recommendation to you is
that you don't cause me to pay any more.

16:19.041 --> 16:20.582
Trent, come on. We're going. Move.

16:20.583 --> 16:21.499
- Helen.
- [Alex] Now.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.250
- That isn't enough.
- It's not enough?

16:26.375 --> 16:27.458
No.

16:28.125 --> 16:29.041
[Eleanor] Oh.

16:31.166 --> 16:32.000
[scoffs]

16:33.541 --> 16:35.749
Helen. Helen.

16:35.750 --> 16:37.499
Do you really wanna do this?

16:37.500 --> 16:41.165
Pull the trigger, you die. You understand?

16:41.166 --> 16:44.415
Helen... I support and love you

16:44.416 --> 16:47.540
and usually would absolutely be here
for you wreaking bloody vengeance,

16:47.541 --> 16:49.957
but this does feel like
something we should walk away from.

16:49.958 --> 16:52.500
Yeah. Yeah. That's...
That's good advice, Sam.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.457
I knew a man once.

16:56.458 --> 16:57.833
My stepfather.

16:58.333 --> 17:00.750
He was a drunk and an idiot and a slob,

17:01.541 --> 17:04.750
but he took someone from me,
just like you did.

17:06.041 --> 17:08.625
Now, he took them
because he thought that he could.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.499
Because he thought
nothing would happen to him,

17:11.500 --> 17:13.707
that the person
that he took from me didn't matter.

17:13.708 --> 17:16.041
But he was wrong, and he paid.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.457
Now, why do you think
that you don't have to pay?

17:20.458 --> 17:23.374
Why do you think
that you get to leave this room

17:23.375 --> 17:24.915
and forget about what you did?

17:24.916 --> 17:26.457
Helen, let's all of us just go.

17:26.458 --> 17:29.707
You can walk out of here.
Your friends, they can walk out of here.

17:29.708 --> 17:31.082
We can put all this behind us.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.290
Let's walk out. Come on.

17:32.291 --> 17:36.707
I sympathize with your complaint,
I do, but this is over. It's finished.

17:36.708 --> 17:39.125
I'm not contesting
a fucking parking ticket.

17:39.791 --> 17:42.874
This isn't a complaint. This is vengeance.

17:42.875 --> 17:44.749
[Alex] What are you talking about?

17:44.750 --> 17:46.540
We can't undo what's done.

17:46.541 --> 17:48.582
We can't bring people back.

17:48.583 --> 17:52.540
This here is as good an ending
as you're gonna get, so take it.

17:52.541 --> 17:53.749
[Sam] Helen.

17:53.750 --> 17:55.124
This is <i>not</i> you.

17:55.125 --> 17:56.499
Who do you think I am, Sam?

17:56.500 --> 17:57.833
I think you're my friend.

17:58.375 --> 17:59.457
I think you're Helen.

17:59.458 --> 18:02.582
Helen Webb, Helen... Dawson. Daisy...

18:02.583 --> 18:05.082
Whatever the fuck. I don't care.
I just wanna help you.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.624
Just because you let her live,
it doesn't mean you let her win.

18:07.625 --> 18:09.582
You took someone away from me.

18:09.583 --> 18:12.207
You sent a killer to my house,
where my children sleep.

18:12.208 --> 18:14.290
There have to be consequences.
There have to be.

18:14.291 --> 18:16.582
Well, who did we send?
Who did I take from you?

18:16.583 --> 18:17.958
You took Jason.

18:18.875 --> 18:22.707
I need to know why. I need to know
who he was and why you killed him.

18:22.708 --> 18:24.582
That's the man on the bench.

18:24.583 --> 18:28.041
Jesus! It wasn't even us.
I never ordered that hit.

18:28.791 --> 18:29.624
You're lying.

18:29.625 --> 18:31.874
All of this
and you haven't even got the right people!

18:31.875 --> 18:33.082
You're lying.

18:33.083 --> 18:36.540
I don't know anything about your friend.
I did not have him killed.

18:36.541 --> 18:38.874
Now, why don't you put your gun down

18:38.875 --> 18:41.374
before you make yourself
look even more silly?

18:41.375 --> 18:42.666
- Williams!
- Mm?

18:43.375 --> 18:46.040
Williams, there was a number
that you were supposed to call

18:46.041 --> 18:47.957
if you found anything at Jason's flat.

18:47.958 --> 18:50.124
The people who hired you
gave you that number.

18:50.125 --> 18:51.165
Yeah.

18:51.166 --> 18:53.083
[Helen] Yeah. Okay.

18:53.666 --> 18:57.124
If she calls that number
and either of your phones ring,

18:57.125 --> 19:00.250
then the very next sound that you hear
will be my gun going off.

19:01.041 --> 19:01.958
Call away.

19:02.625 --> 19:05.083
I did not have your friend killed.

19:06.250 --> 19:07.374
[line rings]

19:16.041 --> 19:17.875
- You?
- [cell phone rings]

19:19.666 --> 19:21.874
- You.
- [Trent] I'm so sorry.

19:21.875 --> 19:23.832
- [Alex gasps]
- I'm sorry.

19:23.833 --> 19:25.749
- [tires screech]
- Development happening here.

19:25.750 --> 19:27.124
- Just FYI.
- [man 2] Step aside!

19:27.125 --> 19:30.499
- [man 3] Show me your hands!
- Open that door right fucking now!

19:30.500 --> 19:31.999
[man 4] Get the fuck back!

19:32.000 --> 19:33.915
- I'm sorry.
- [Alex] Oh, Trent, be quiet!

19:33.916 --> 19:36.999
I wanted to fix what I had done,
to prove I could handle myself.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.624
- [Sam] Trent, stop talking.
- [Alex] What?

19:38.625 --> 19:40.124
You.

19:40.125 --> 19:43.290
He's... He's... He doesn't have
anything to do with this. He's lying.

19:43.291 --> 19:46.665
He doesn't know what he's talking about.
He's just trying to protect his mother.

19:46.666 --> 19:47.875
It was me. It was!

19:48.791 --> 19:49.624
He's not lying.

19:49.625 --> 19:51.207
- I'm so sorry.
- Helen, don't listen.

19:51.208 --> 19:53.915
- He doesn't know what he's saying!
- [Eleanor] Fucking hell.

19:53.916 --> 19:55.665
[man 5] Who the fuck are they?!

19:55.666 --> 19:58.665
- Guns down. We will shoot!
- [man 6] Put your gun down!

19:58.666 --> 20:00.499
[Trent] It's my fault. It's all my fault.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.666
I had to cover up my mess.
I didn't think that I...

20:04.541 --> 20:05.874
Kai, I am so sorry.

20:05.875 --> 20:08.040
I am so... I am so, so sorry.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.624
Shut the fuck up, Trent.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.582
Put your guns on the floor!

20:11.583 --> 20:13.707
- Lads, it's kicking off.
- [Trent] I am sorry.

20:13.708 --> 20:16.124
But please do not hurt anyone.
Please don't hurt anyone!

20:16.125 --> 20:19.749
Helen. Look at me. Fucking look at me now!
Are you gonna do that? He's a kid!

20:19.750 --> 20:20.832
[Alex] Yeah.

20:20.833 --> 20:22.332
[Sam] Right. Come on, we're going.

20:22.333 --> 20:25.415
We're going. We're getting out now.
Stop! Please, Helen.

20:25.416 --> 20:29.499
If you hurt my son, this will never end
for you, I promise you that.

20:29.500 --> 20:31.500
- You'll never outrun it!
- [Helen yells]

20:38.083 --> 20:39.291
- [Alex exclaims]
- [Sam] Fuck.

20:40.541 --> 20:42.082
[Trent] No! Please! Please don't!

20:42.083 --> 20:43.583
Don't! Don't! Please!

[Trent] No! No! Please! Please!

20:58.750 --> 20:59.750
[Kai-Ming whimpers]

21:02.833 --> 21:04.041
You shouldn't have done that.

21:05.291 --> 21:07.540
You sh... you shouldn't have done that.
That was mine.

21:07.541 --> 21:10.499
- You shouldn't have done that, Sam.
- It's okay.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.415
[Helen] You shouldn't have done that, Sam.

21:12.416 --> 21:13.333
It's over.

21:14.291 --> 21:15.333
It's over.

21:24.333 --> 21:25.166
[Helen exhales]

21:25.750 --> 21:29.082
Okay, yeah, we...
we need to fuck off out of here.

21:29.083 --> 21:30.665
- [Eleanor] Mm.
- Now, I reckon.

We'll clear this up. Go on.
