We're going on
the bootlegger tour today.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.072
Yeah, we are. You and me.

00:32.158 --> 00:34.575
Two tickets to the tour
at the hotel down the street.

[whoops] history.

'cause it's boring? High five?

00:44.211 --> 00:45.794
It's bootleggers, you fools.

00:45.921 --> 00:48.839
Bootleggers and smugglers
used to hang out at that hotel.

00:48.966 --> 00:51.300
At that hotel.
What were they doing in there?

00:51.385 --> 00:52.593
Whatever they wanted.

00:52.678 --> 00:55.262
Selling their illegal goods
and illegal booze.

00:55.306 --> 00:57.222
It was just like
a badass farmers market.

00:57.266 --> 00:58.474
-Don't say "badass."
-good-ass?

00:58.601 --> 00:59.808
-No.
-Great-ass?

00:59.894 --> 01:01.143
-Okay, fine.
-It's nice that they gave us

01:01.228 --> 01:02.978
Free tickets just 'cause
we're a local business.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.980
More places should do that.
But not us.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.565
I don't want
to give anything away.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.025
Well, I'm excited, too.

Mom and louise day,

01:10.738 --> 01:11.987
Oh, should we wear boots?

01:12.114 --> 01:14.656
Or leggings, or both?
Or dress as flappers?

01:14.742 --> 01:17.242
Call ourselves the bootlegging
flappy bappies? Huh?

01:17.369 --> 01:18.744
-[louise] eh.
-I'll keep thinking.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.579
Who wants to see

01:48.317 --> 01:52.277
Can we? Let me take you all
the way back to the jazz age,

01:52.404 --> 01:56.073
When flappers were flappenin'
and illegal hooch was happenin'.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.034
And the hats? Don't get me
started on the hats.

01:59.161 --> 02:00.202
Tell us about the hats.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.538
It's just,
people had amazing hats.

02:03.332 --> 02:05.541
Whoa, look out the window.
That's balloon lady.

02:05.626 --> 02:06.792
Mom hasn't been gone 20 minutes

02:06.877 --> 02:08.710
And dad already
has a wandering eye.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.212
No, gene. Balloon lady.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.464
One of the sidewalk performers
from down by the wharf.

02:12.550 --> 02:14.883
-She's a ba-luminary.
-[gene] oh, yeah.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.885

wait, is that the bubble master?

02:17.012 --> 02:18.679
-Yes, it is.
-Holy crap. Two heavyweights.

[gene]
and doug the juggler?

02:20.558 --> 02:22.224
-Are you kidding me?
-[tina] and, also,

02:22.351 --> 02:24.309
A guy with a bunch
of dirty pipes.

02:24.395 --> 02:26.103
Oh, my god, they're coming in.

02:26.188 --> 02:27.813
Okay, we're all here.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.106
And pipe guy, for some reason.

02:29.233 --> 02:31.567
I overheard you guys
when I was lurking near you.

02:31.610 --> 02:34.069
Now, how do we decide
who gets giovanni's spot?

02:34.196 --> 02:35.571
We fight?
I'm up for fighting.

02:35.698 --> 02:37.156
Um, what's going on?

02:37.283 --> 02:38.615
-Giovanni died.
-Oh, no.

02:38.701 --> 02:41.034
Is that the guy who tap-danced
on a piece of wood?

02:41.120 --> 02:43.495
Yeah, I guess you could say
he, uh, tapped out.

02:43.539 --> 02:45.414
And he had the best spot
on front street.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.082
Right by the entrance
to the wharf.

02:47.168 --> 02:49.251
So now we're trying to decide
who gets his spot.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.795
-And I think it should be me.
-Oh, please, bubble boy.

02:51.881 --> 02:53.005
I'm making a balloon sword.

02:53.132 --> 02:54.339
-Let's all make weapons.
-That's cute.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.175
-I juggle real swords.
-[grumbles]

02:56.302 --> 02:58.510
Uh, would any of you
like to order something

02:58.596 --> 02:59.845
Before you sword-fight?

02:59.930 --> 03:01.221
-Ah, fine.
-Okay.
-Yeah.

03:01.348 --> 03:02.806
Are those leaking something?

03:02.892 --> 03:05.100
-Uh, probably.
-Okay.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.518
[manager]
<i> so here we have</i>

03:06.604 --> 03:09.146
An ordinary bookcase.
Just your regular old... Wuh-oh!

03:09.190 --> 03:11.607
-Whoa.
-Or is it a secret entrance

03:11.734 --> 03:13.942
To the hotel's old speakeasy?

03:14.069 --> 03:16.028
It is. Go on in!

03:16.113 --> 03:17.988
From 1920 to 1933,

03:18.073 --> 03:22.242
This was a well-hidden haven
for drinking gin and doing sins.

03:22.328 --> 03:23.785
After prohibition, it became

03:23.871 --> 03:25.913
A very inconvenient
storage room,

03:25.998 --> 03:27.581
But now it's a bar again.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.291
-Go ahead, look around.
-Ho-ho,

03:29.376 --> 03:30.959
We have way too few secret rooms
at our restaurant.

03:31.086 --> 03:32.502
You've mentioned that.

03:32.630 --> 03:34.379
[manager] [old-timey voice]
look out, the cops are coming!

03:34.506 --> 03:36.131
-Harold, hold my stash.
-[grunts]

03:36.258 --> 03:38.217
[regular voice]
if law enforcement showed up,

03:38.302 --> 03:40.427
The doorman would warn
the naughty patrons inside here

03:40.512 --> 03:42.971
Through this simple hose
with a little bell thingy

03:43.057 --> 03:44.765
At the end of it
that looks like a flower.

03:44.850 --> 03:47.351
-Oh.
-And then the bartender
could talk back through it.

03:47.519 --> 03:48.894
[old-timey voice]
"thanks for the warning, buddy."

03:49.021 --> 03:50.270
[regular voice]
and everyone could escape

03:50.397 --> 03:52.147
Through a secret tunnel
behind the bar

03:52.233 --> 03:53.482
That led to the pier.

03:53.609 --> 03:54.650
-Oh.
-That same tunnel

03:54.735 --> 03:56.068
Was also used by the bootleggers

03:56.153 --> 03:58.820
To sneak booze and other
smuggled items into the hotel.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.405
It was just
a really great tunnel.

04:00.491 --> 04:02.783
-Is the tunnel still here?
-Uh, sadly, no.

04:02.826 --> 04:05.244
No, the whole thing was
filled in by the city in 1953.

04:05.329 --> 04:06.954
No sense of fun,
those city people.

04:07.122 --> 04:08.872
But everything else here
is still intact,

04:08.999 --> 04:11.083
So you can have a look around,
and then

04:11.168 --> 04:12.542
I'll take you to room 111,

04:12.628 --> 04:15.254
Where the notorious smuggler
slippery sam always stayed,

04:15.381 --> 04:18.924
And where
he was eventually betrayed.

04:19.051 --> 04:20.842
You can react.
You could gasp or "ooh,"

04:20.928 --> 04:22.803
-Or somethin' like--
-[all oohing]

04:22.930 --> 04:24.346
-Wow.
-Thank you, that's great.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.266
[teddy]
they're having a sit-down
in your restaurant?

04:27.351 --> 04:28.809
That's a big deal.
I don't think anyone's

04:28.894 --> 04:31.395
-Ever seen them all
in one place.
-Like the beatles.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.147
-Well, I get the biggest crowds.
-Ha! Maybe 15 years ago.

04:34.233 --> 04:36.942
Bubbles are over. Can you make
a bald eagle out of a bubble?

04:37.069 --> 04:39.069
-I don't think so.
-Bubbles will never be over.

04:39.154 --> 04:40.445
Bubbles are forever.

04:40.531 --> 04:43.240
Bubbles, balloons,
you both blow. Get it?

04:43.325 --> 04:47.577
I found these pipes in
a dumpster by a grocery store.

04:47.663 --> 04:49.162
Look, this isn't
getting us anywhere.

04:49.248 --> 04:52.249
There is only one thing left
to do: Let the street decide.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.583
Uh, w-what does that mean?

04:53.752 --> 04:56.211
We perform and the winner
is chosen by the audience.

04:56.338 --> 04:57.838
Wow. Uh, when are
you gonna do that?

04:57.965 --> 05:00.590
-And-and where?
-Right here, right now.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.050
-[all gasp]
-wait, what?

05:02.094 --> 05:04.344
-They mean us. We would decide.
-Ooh.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.513
-I think I'm gonna throw up.
-Well, that's the least fun

05:06.682 --> 05:07.973
Street performance.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.225
So, this is the room 111,

05:10.394 --> 05:12.019
Where slippery sam
would always stay.

05:12.104 --> 05:14.938
But they could have called him
"suspicious of everyone" sam,

05:15.065 --> 05:16.732
Because he made modifications
to the room--

05:16.817 --> 05:18.567
Unbeknownst to management--

05:18.694 --> 05:20.235
In order to hide
his stolen goods

05:20.362 --> 05:22.321
From his fellow thieves
and ne'er-do-wells.

05:22.406 --> 05:24.573
Just an ordinary bedpost, right?

05:24.700 --> 05:26.783
[all oohing]

05:26.910 --> 05:28.410
And did you notice
the antique outlets?

05:28.537 --> 05:29.745
Aha!

05:29.830 --> 05:31.455
-[all oohing]
-but the hiding spot

05:31.540 --> 05:34.791
For his most famous hidden loot
has never been found.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.044
-Why not?
-I was getting to that.

05:37.129 --> 05:38.420
-Oh.
-In 1932,

05:38.505 --> 05:41.089
Sam checked into the hotel
hoping to find a fence

05:41.175 --> 05:42.841
For the jade jellyfish.

05:42.968 --> 05:46.553
A dazzling piece of home decor
that was estimated to be worth

05:46.722 --> 05:48.180
Around $40,000 at that time,

05:48.223 --> 05:52.184
Which today would be
the equivalent of over $700,000.

05:52.302 --> 05:54.394
-[all oohing]
-holy crap!
-The jade jellyfish

05:54.521 --> 05:56.063
<i> Was stolen from</i>
<i> its original owner,</i>

05:56.148 --> 05:58.607
<i> A new york collector</i>
<i> named carlyle linus,</i>

05:58.692 --> 06:00.817
And hidden somewhere
in or around the hotel

06:00.903 --> 06:02.694
<i> While a sale was arranged.</i>

06:02.780 --> 06:05.655
Slippery sam had more
than his share of enemies,

06:05.783 --> 06:07.616
So not only did he hide
the jellyfish,

06:07.701 --> 06:10.994
<i> He also left behind a letter</i>
<i>for his girlfriend mimi molero,</i>

06:11.121 --> 06:12.996
<i> In case anything</i>
<i> should happen to him.</i>

06:13.123 --> 06:15.082
But it would turn out
to be mimi herself

06:15.167 --> 06:17.542
Who would betray slippery sam.

06:17.628 --> 06:19.044
[gasps]
mimi.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.630
Yes. On October 15th, 1932,

06:21.799 --> 06:24.257
Mimi was arrested for running
an unlicensed casino

06:24.343 --> 06:26.051
On a converted barge
out in the bay.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.845
She called it
the s.S.<i> Perfectly legal,</i>

06:28.931 --> 06:30.389
<i> But it certainly was not.</i>

06:30.516 --> 06:32.808
<i> To avoid jail time,</i>
<i> she sang like a canary</i>

06:32.893 --> 06:34.643
<i> About her notorious boyfriend,</i>

06:34.686 --> 06:36.728
Giving the g-men enough dirt
to put sam away

06:36.814 --> 06:38.438
For the rest of his life.

06:38.565 --> 06:39.940
<i> Which wasn't long,</i>
<i> because he died in a shoot-out</i>

06:40.067 --> 06:41.525
<i> In this very hotel</i>

06:41.610 --> 06:43.276
When they tried
to take him into custody.

06:43.362 --> 06:44.861
-Aw.
-See? That's why you don't need

06:44.947 --> 06:46.780
-A girlfriend, logan.
-Mom.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.782
Now, sam's letter to mimi
was discovered

06:48.867 --> 06:50.659
In the bedpost years later.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.870
A cryptic clue from a dead
smuggler to a femme fatale.

06:54.039 --> 06:57.082
"our green friend--"
clearly, the jellyfish--

06:57.167 --> 07:00.210
"has made a home
20 paces west of poseidon."

07:00.337 --> 07:02.504
Nearly everyone agrees
that "poseidon,"

07:02.631 --> 07:04.589
Greek god of the sea,
means the hiding spot

07:04.716 --> 07:06.091
Was 20 paces from the ocean,

07:06.176 --> 07:08.468
And this almost certainly
refers to some nook

07:08.554 --> 07:10.846
In the now filled-in
bootleggers' tunnel

07:10.931 --> 07:12.180
Which ran under front street.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.974
If only he used
the hotel safe, right?

07:14.101 --> 07:16.184
-[soft laughter]
-yeah, that was funny.

07:16.311 --> 07:20.147
Now, if you'll follow me back
to our speakeasy/vip lounge,

07:20.232 --> 07:23.358
You can enjoy a complementary
rumrunner's blind blackout--

07:23.444 --> 07:25.610
Which I believe is apple juice--
or peruse

07:25.696 --> 07:28.238
Our updated cocktail list
and light appetizer menu.

07:28.323 --> 07:30.240
-[edith] is there a discount?
-[manager] there is not, but--

07:30.325 --> 07:32.325
-[edith] I'll take the juice.
-[manager] all right.

07:32.453 --> 07:34.119
Let's not stay.
I don't want to stay.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.537
Also, I have to pee.
Let's go.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.414
Bye. Bye.
So sorry we couldn't chat.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.207
-[groans]
-[linda] oh, there you are.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.293
Do you want to split
this tomato-feta thing with me?

07:41.378 --> 07:43.420
-[whispering] mom.
Sorry. Listen.
-Ow, ow.

07:43.505 --> 07:44.754
-What?
-We know something

07:44.882 --> 07:47.757
About the jade jellyfish
that the manager doesn't.

07:47.885 --> 07:49.509
-That no one else knows.
-We-we do?

07:49.678 --> 07:50.677
-Yes.
-What?

07:50.762 --> 07:52.596
"poseidon" doesn't mean the sea.

07:52.681 --> 07:55.390
It's got to be the poseidon
statue near the ride.

07:55.476 --> 07:57.809
In fischoeder's secret
clubhouse under the pier.

07:57.853 --> 07:59.603
The statue where
you pinch his nipples?

07:59.646 --> 08:02.898
Yes. We can go there and maybe
find the jade jellyfish.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.108
Find it? I-I don't know.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.401
Please? I need you.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.987
We're the bootlegging
flappy bappies.

08:09.114 --> 08:11.323
We are? You and me?
Flappy bappies?

08:11.450 --> 08:13.408
Flappin' together,
bappin' forever?

08:13.494 --> 08:14.409
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So?

08:14.495 --> 08:15.911
[whispers]
okay, okay, let's do it.

08:16.038 --> 08:17.204
Let's go find
the jolly jellyfish.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.830
-[louise] jade.
-[linda] yeah.

08:18.916 --> 08:20.540
-Hmm.
-Okay, ready.

08:20.667 --> 08:21.958
You sure you don't have
to tinkle-dinkle?

08:22.085 --> 08:25.837
Ugh, yes. But, hey, mom,
want to make $700,000?

08:25.964 --> 08:27.339
Ugh, you sound
just like your father.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.341
I am not selling vitamins
to my friends.

08:29.468 --> 08:31.259
No, mom.
[indistinct whispering]

08:31.386 --> 08:32.802
And then...
[indistinct whispering]

08:32.888 --> 08:34.679
Did you brush your teeth today?

08:34.765 --> 08:36.097
Mom! No.

08:38.727 --> 08:41.645
So, yeah, we're gonna go
find slippery sam's jellyfish

08:41.772 --> 08:43.104
In the under-pier.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.439
[bob]
<i> linda, what are you</i>
<i> talking about?</i>

08:44.566 --> 08:45.774
[whispering]
louise thinks she can find

08:45.901 --> 08:46.942
This smuggler's jellyfish thingy

08:47.110 --> 08:48.902
-They told us about on the tour.
<i> -Okay.</i>

08:49.071 --> 08:50.987
I know, I'm sure
it's long gone by now,

08:51.114 --> 08:53.073
But bob,
we're doing a thing together.

08:53.158 --> 08:54.491
She wants to do it with me.

08:54.618 --> 08:55.951
We don't have
a lot of things like that,

08:56.036 --> 08:57.536
And this one
I didn't have to force at all.

08:57.663 --> 08:58.912
Remember when
I tried to make her watch

08:58.997 --> 09:00.413
<i> Knots landing</i> reruns with me?

09:00.499 --> 09:02.040
-Mom. Come on.
-[regular volume] okay.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.208
Okay, see you soon, bye.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.043
All right, come on. Here we go.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.461
Damn it. Who locks the door

09:06.588 --> 09:08.004
To a secret underground
clubhouse?

09:08.090 --> 09:09.422
No-fun poopheads, that's who.

09:09.508 --> 09:12.008
Hey, you want to go
get a hot dog or ice cream?

09:12.094 --> 09:13.176
Yes, that's it. Ice cream.

09:13.303 --> 09:14.886
-[cackles]
-oh, great.

09:14.972 --> 09:16.721
-I'm hungry.
-No, that's another way

09:16.807 --> 09:18.557
To get into the under-pier.

09:18.642 --> 09:19.766
-Oh.
-Let's go.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.226
Ah... Ow!

09:21.311 --> 09:24.104
-It's a little cold
for ice cream.
-I don't think

09:24.189 --> 09:25.564
They're getting ice cream.

09:25.649 --> 09:26.940
But if they are, I want some.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.109
Ah, not before you've had
some growing food.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.528
Don't say "growing food."
ugh!

09:31.613 --> 09:32.988
-Hi.
-Hello.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.198
Uh, can I get a sample
of the double-fudge nut blast?

09:35.242 --> 09:36.658
-Mom. Oh, my gosh.
-What?

09:36.785 --> 09:37.909
The weirdest thing--
we just saw

09:37.995 --> 09:39.953
Mr. Fischoeder,
your boss, right?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.580
-Yeah?
-He's over on the wonder wheel

09:41.665 --> 09:44.249
Throwing paper airplanes
made out of ten dollar bills.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.334
Seriously?
I love ten dollar bills.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.503
-Be right back.
-You're a sneaky little

09:48.630 --> 09:51.715
-Slippery sam, aren't you?
-I can be somewhat slippery.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.842
-Wow, look at that.
-After you?

09:53.927 --> 09:56.469
-Wait, no, I lied. After me.
-Yep, yep.

09:58.015 --> 09:59.931
[teddy]
a chinese dragon
made out of balloons?

10:00.017 --> 10:01.766
[tina]
how is anyone gonna top this?

10:01.893 --> 10:03.977
-Nudity?
-Probably not.
-[clears throat]

10:04.104 --> 10:06.396
-Sorry.
-You guys like
showstopping finales?

10:06.481 --> 10:07.731
[teddy]
I do.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.107
-[tina] whoa.
-Oh, my god.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.735
-Wow. That's impressive.
-Oh...

10:11.820 --> 10:12.652
You and I are gonna get married.

10:12.738 --> 10:14.112
-Oops.
-Who's next?

10:14.239 --> 10:17.157
Who's next? This is the most
amazing day of my life!

10:17.200 --> 10:19.034
You know, it's actually
kind of fun down here

10:19.119 --> 10:20.910
When no one's chasing you
and trying to murder you.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.454
I guess most places
are like that.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.831
So, the secret clubhouse
with the poseidon statue

10:24.916 --> 10:27.876
Will look just like a wall
with some crap around it.

10:28.003 --> 10:29.878
Oh, whoa,
I tripped on a seahorse.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.546
Aw, they're cute.
Except that one.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.173
Mom, come on. We're down here

10:33.300 --> 10:35.634
To find the jade jellyfish,
not to look at cute old things.

10:35.677 --> 10:38.345
You're right. Besides,
I can look at cute old things

10:38.430 --> 10:39.804
When we get home
and see your father.

10:39.931 --> 10:41.264
[laughs]
good... That's a good...

10:41.391 --> 10:42.724
Know what?
Stop getting distracted.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.809
Right, right, right.
Aw, dead pigeon.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.686
-Mom!
-Yep, yep, yep, yep.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.648
[tina]
seems like one
we could have done outside.

10:49.733 --> 10:50.774
For those of us who have to mop

10:50.901 --> 10:52.359
-All this up later.
-Tina, shh.

10:52.486 --> 10:54.319
[gene]
whoa.

10:54.446 --> 10:57.405
-He just made
smoking cool again.
-Yeah.

10:57.532 --> 10:59.324
-[both] wow.
-What?!

10:59.451 --> 11:00.525
He's amazing.

11:00.661 --> 11:03.578
I call it "reincarnation's
infinite spirit."

11:03.664 --> 11:04.454
Heh. Okay.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.331
I do feel a little reincarnated.

11:06.416 --> 11:07.290
Wait till I go.

11:07.376 --> 11:09.209
Uh, excuse me, can-can I wash

11:09.336 --> 11:10.835
My flip flops in your sink?

11:10.962 --> 11:12.087
Uh, uh, uh...

11:12.214 --> 11:13.880
I-- yeah, in the bathroom.

11:13.965 --> 11:15.423
Oh, never mind.
[snorting]

11:15.509 --> 11:17.717
I've got more spit
than I thought.

11:17.803 --> 11:18.802
-Gross.
-Mm.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.262
Ugh, why does
this secret clubhouse

11:21.348 --> 11:22.764
Have to be so damn secret?

11:22.849 --> 11:24.224
Well, I think
the important thing is

11:24.351 --> 11:26.601
The bootlegging flappy
bappies are having themselves

11:26.687 --> 11:28.061
Quite an adventure.

11:28.146 --> 11:29.562
Can't we just be
the bootleggers?

11:29.690 --> 11:30.689
The bootlegging belchers?

11:30.816 --> 11:32.774
No. Anyway, I'm glad
we're doing this,

11:32.943 --> 11:34.943
-No matter what happens.
-Oh, my god.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.362
The clubhouse. This is it.
The hatch! We found it.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.531
-Yay!
-Let's open this baby up.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.533
Somehow, from the outside...

11:41.660 --> 11:43.243
-[both grunting]
-[logan] mom, walk faster.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.994
-Dang it. Wait.
-We're gonna lose them, come on.

11:45.122 --> 11:46.913
-[shushes] hold on.
-[cynthia] these are
not good walking shoes...

11:46.998 --> 11:48.581
-Do you hear something?
-What? What?

11:48.667 --> 11:50.500
[logan] you never bring
good walking shoes.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.460
I'm gonna buy you
some comfortable flats.

11:52.587 --> 11:53.545
Some sensible flats.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.088
Oh, no.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.841
-Logan?
-Oh. Hey, louise.

11:57.876 --> 11:59.217
Hi, linda.

11:59.302 --> 12:01.094
Quick, let's hit 'em over
the head with something heavy.

12:01.179 --> 12:04.264
-No, never mind.
-What? You can't just take
a great idea back like that.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.936
I can't believe you
followed us here, logan.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.354
Wait, how did you know
to follow us here?

12:11.481 --> 12:13.148
Oh, just a little thing
called hearing you talk

12:13.233 --> 12:14.441
About finding
the jade jellyfish

12:14.568 --> 12:17.068
Through the secret pipes
on the hotel tour thing.

12:17.154 --> 12:18.945
Damn it.
That's so sneaky.

12:19.030 --> 12:21.156
I have to respect it
but I also don't like you,

12:21.241 --> 12:22.449
So I-I'm at a loss here.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.617
You'll also be
at a loss when we find

12:24.745 --> 12:26.202
The jellyfish before you.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.204
Now, would you do me
a favor and-and just tell me

12:28.331 --> 12:29.739
Where this poseidon ride is?

12:29.750 --> 12:32.917
Uh, I mean, I think
poseidon rode, like, a seahorse?

12:33.003 --> 12:35.044
So maybe that has something
to do with it?

12:35.130 --> 12:36.713
Seahorse, huh?

12:36.798 --> 12:38.339
But, ugh.
What am I saying?

12:38.425 --> 12:39.924
Why am I telling you
any of this?

12:40.010 --> 12:42.469
Wait, what? Oh.
Quiet, louise.

12:42.596 --> 12:45.180
-Oh, logan. What about
the seahorses we saw back--
-mom!

12:45.265 --> 12:46.890
It's probably
not even down here.

12:47.017 --> 12:49.392
Let's just go home and be the
amount of rich we already are.

12:49.478 --> 12:51.436
We're leaving?
Oh, thank god. I need a shower.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.646
And you are definitely
doing a tubby tonight.

12:53.732 --> 12:55.148
-Mom!
-A bath, a bath.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.524
Idiots.

12:56.610 --> 12:57.692
Good thinking, louise.

12:57.861 --> 12:59.194
You clever little
cutie patootie.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.320
Okay, come on.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.322
-Use that mom strength.
-[both grunting]

13:02.407 --> 13:04.783
Use your muscles, mom.
Please. Come on.

13:04.868 --> 13:06.868
-[grunting]
-whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.828
Wait a minute. 20 paces west.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.830
-What?
-The statue of poseidon

13:10.916 --> 13:12.624
Is right on the other side
of this hatch,

13:12.709 --> 13:14.125
-Like, a few feet away.
-Yeah?

13:14.211 --> 13:16.795
So I'm realizing that based
on what side of the country

13:16.922 --> 13:18.671
We live on
and how the ocean works,

13:18.757 --> 13:20.423
20 paces west is that way.

13:20.509 --> 13:22.342
Outside the hatch.
We don't have to open it.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.385
Well, that's good, 'cause
that thing is not budging.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.262
That wall looks like
it's about 20 paces away.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.598
And it looks like it's been
around for at least 100 years.

13:28.683 --> 13:30.475
-It's got to be in there.
-Wait, in the wall?

13:30.602 --> 13:32.977
Yeah, in the wall.
Classic slippery sam.

13:33.104 --> 13:35.396
-Come on, come on, come on.
-Um, louise?

13:35.482 --> 13:37.273
-The boards are cracking.
-Yeah.

13:37.359 --> 13:39.392
But not in, like,
too dangerous of a way.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.945
Oh my god. I-I think
these boards are rotten.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.239
Come on, mom.
You know how old boards are.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.074
They crack.
It's part of their whole charm.

13:46.201 --> 13:48.952
-I-it's just--
-look, we'll just walk
nice and easy, okay?

13:48.995 --> 13:50.370
See? [vocalizing]

13:50.455 --> 13:52.163
Okay, but one more crack
and we're out of here.

13:52.249 --> 13:53.998
-Fine.
-[board creaks]

13:54.084 --> 13:55.583
That was more of a creak.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.293
This is also very good.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.671
[teddy]
yeah. You think he just had
all those things with him?

13:59.756 --> 14:02.131
What?
He did not just do that.

14:02.259 --> 14:03.758
[muffled] mm, I did do it.
Yeah, I did. I did it.

14:03.927 --> 14:05.927
At any moment, he could have
cut himself with the sword,

14:06.096 --> 14:08.012
Taken a bite of the lightbulb,
dropped the apple

14:08.139 --> 14:09.556
On the ground,
and then it's all dirty.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.349
[tina]
damn.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.309
-Yeah.
-I think I'm gonna faint.

14:14.479 --> 14:17.146
And that is why I deserve
giovanni's spot.

14:17.232 --> 14:18.606
-And they do not.
-[applause]

14:18.692 --> 14:20.233
Are you gonna finish that apple

14:20.360 --> 14:21.943
And/or can I play around
with your sword?

14:22.070 --> 14:23.945
-Sure, whatever. Here, catch.
-Yay!

14:24.030 --> 14:25.238
-No.
-Boo.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.615
20 paces from which seahorse?

14:27.701 --> 14:30.118
[groans] I guess
I'll have to do all of them.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.120
You seem cranky. Are you hungry?

14:32.205 --> 14:34.080
-I brought raisins.
-No.

14:34.165 --> 14:35.623
Okay, maybe a handful.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.750
Louise, I really want you
to come back.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.627
In a minute.
I'm just gonna try this way.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.629
Louise. I'd come grab you,

14:41.673 --> 14:43.214
But I'm too heavy and I'm
afraid we'd both fall through.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.592
So please walk your little
feet back towards me,

14:45.635 --> 14:47.594
Slowly and carefully,
but also somehow quickly.

14:47.679 --> 14:50.346
I am walking back toward you,
but I got to go the long way,

14:50.473 --> 14:52.432
Toward the wall,
which coincidentally

14:52.517 --> 14:54.475
Is where the jellyfish is,
which is unrelated.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.395
I'm just walking back
towards you the long way, okay?

14:57.522 --> 14:59.063
Uh-oh.

14:59.149 --> 15:01.774
-Whoa!
-Louise!

15:01.902 --> 15:03.359
-Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
-Oh, no.

15:03.445 --> 15:04.402
We were so close.

15:04.529 --> 15:06.487
Okay, minor setback.
Let's think.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.948
Louise! We are not gonna
find the jellyfish!

15:09.075 --> 15:11.075
-What?
-I'm sorry, sweetie. I just--

15:11.161 --> 15:13.077
There's just no way
it's still down here.

15:13.204 --> 15:14.662
What do you mean?
The letter said--

15:14.748 --> 15:16.039
It's been 100 years.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.833
Things get bashed around
and filled in and washed away.

15:18.877 --> 15:21.044
It's just how it is with things.
I can barely find

15:21.212 --> 15:23.546
-My car keys when I need 'em.
-So this whole time,

15:23.632 --> 15:25.506
You never thought
we'd find the jellyfish?

15:25.634 --> 15:28.843
-I mean... Eh...
-Then w-what are we
doing down here?

15:28.929 --> 15:31.054
Aw, honey.
Having fun, right?

15:31.139 --> 15:32.805
The bootlegging flappy bappies?

15:32.974 --> 15:35.391
No. No.
No bootlegging flappy bappies.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.810
You've just been lying
to me this whole time.

15:37.896 --> 15:38.937
I'm sorry.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.438
You're a bootlegging
flappy liar!

15:40.607 --> 15:43.191
Louise, no.
Ugh, another dead pigeon.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.696
I can't believe this whole time
you were just

15:48.823 --> 15:49.989
Playing pretend with me.

15:50.075 --> 15:52.033
-Like I'm a child.
-I mean, you are a child.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.576
I'm not a child. I'm nine.

15:53.662 --> 15:55.828
Listen, it's been so great
spending the day with you,

15:55.914 --> 15:57.830
Seeing you so excited.
When you have kids,

15:57.916 --> 16:00.333
You'll see how happy it makes
you to see your kids happy.

16:00.451 --> 16:02.293
We were doing it together,
you and me.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.253
We had a thing,
something we could share.

16:04.381 --> 16:06.130
Until it almost got you killed.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.674
I just...

16:07.801 --> 16:09.884
I know it's there, mom.
I know it.

16:10.011 --> 16:12.971
Huh. You really
believe that, don't you?

16:13.056 --> 16:14.681
Yes. I do.

16:15.517 --> 16:16.516
Okay.

16:16.601 --> 16:18.685
Okay?
Like,<i> okay</i> okay?

16:18.853 --> 16:19.978
-Yes. [groans]
-[gasps]

16:20.105 --> 16:21.521
Damn your sweet
little face full of hope.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.564
If you really believe it,
then...

16:23.650 --> 16:26.192
I'm gonna believe it, too.
Maybe. Sort of.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.944
But if you die, you and I
are going to have

16:28.029 --> 16:29.821
Big problems, lady.
Big problems.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.448
-Okay, yeah.
-All right, I think
I have an idea.

16:32.534 --> 16:36.160
I'm a little terrified
about what this is gonna be.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.954
What is dripping
out of those pipes?

16:38.081 --> 16:39.747
-Let's call it water.
-Mm.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.126
♪ ♪

17:12.198 --> 17:14.148
-Damn.
-Oh, my god.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.733
I'm crying, I'm crying.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.410
-So he wins?
-Yeah.

17:17.495 --> 17:19.245
Yeah. Giovanni's spot
is all yours, pipe guy.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.621
You beautiful freak.

17:20.749 --> 17:24.000
Thank you all. But, honestly,
we should share it.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.460
-What?
-Yeah, what?

17:25.587 --> 17:27.503
-Then what the hell
was all of this?
-Tina, calm down.

17:27.630 --> 17:30.131
I really just want Thursday
mornings and Sunday afternoons.

17:30.175 --> 17:33.718
-You sure you want to do that?
-It's what giovanni
would have wanted.

17:33.803 --> 17:36.054
And I should know.
He was my dad.

17:36.139 --> 17:38.056
-He was?
-What?!
-Okay, probably not.

17:38.141 --> 17:39.515
But let's just share the spot.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.059
I've written out
a schedule for you.

17:41.144 --> 17:42.852
It's-it's on a pipe, but still.

17:42.896 --> 17:45.354
-Seems fair.
-Works for me.
-Yeah, I can work with this.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.440
Wow, great. Now, uh,
now that that's settled,

17:47.609 --> 17:48.983
Can, uh, can I bring
you guys some lunch?

17:49.069 --> 17:50.610
-You guys want
to split a burger?
-All right.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.404
-Sure.
-Okay.
-So one burger, split four ways?

17:53.573 --> 17:54.822
Well, there's four of us.

17:54.866 --> 17:56.115
I'll split it.
I got the sword.

17:56.201 --> 17:58.076
Maybe five ways?
I would have some.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.203
This was a great idea, mom.

18:00.330 --> 18:01.579
[groans]
I hate this idea.

18:01.664 --> 18:03.664
Leaving is a good idea,
but we're doing this.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.083
Yep. Yep we are.

18:05.168 --> 18:06.918
[groans] can't I be the one
to go out on the board?

18:07.087 --> 18:09.545
Uh, no, you weigh
more than me, remember?

18:09.631 --> 18:12.006
Stupid adult body.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.802
[groans, moans]

18:15.929 --> 18:18.179
Okay, yeah,
just checking the panels.

18:18.223 --> 18:21.349
How long are we gonna do this?
Like, like, five more seconds?

18:21.434 --> 18:23.226
Where are you?

18:23.269 --> 18:24.727
[gasps]

18:25.563 --> 18:27.105
[gasps]

18:27.899 --> 18:28.689
Ha! I mean, shh.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.191
-Mom. Mom! Look.
-What?

18:30.318 --> 18:32.944
-Holy crap.
-[laughs] ooh! Shh. Shh.

18:33.071 --> 18:35.446
Keep it down.
Mom, keep it down, but look.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.490
Okay, okay, time to come back.
Come, come, come, come.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.368
I knew it. I knew it. I was
right and you were wrong.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.120
-You thought I was just a child.
-Uh-huh. Okay, okay.
You were right.

18:42.247 --> 18:43.579
-Oh, my gosh.
-You were right.
Let, let's just not

18:43.665 --> 18:45.331
Fall into the ocean
and drown to death.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.749
You were like, "oh, I'll
just pretend around her,"

18:46.826 --> 18:48.376
-But it's real.
-Louise.

18:48.419 --> 18:50.753
-Will you ever doubt me again?
-No, no, no.

18:50.839 --> 18:52.880
-Eh, I don't know, maybe.
-It's amazing.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.007
-Put it under your coat.
-Oh, ooh.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.926
Oop, oof.
Ooh, it's squishing my boob.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.011
Dang it. Where is it?
[groans]

18:59.097 --> 19:00.847
You know, we could probably find

19:00.932 --> 19:02.306
Some bootlegger treasure
on ebay.

19:02.433 --> 19:03.891
-You think so?
-I'm gonna say yes.

19:03.977 --> 19:06.018
-More raisins?
-Thanks, mom.

19:06.104 --> 19:09.021
All right, all we got to do now
is get past the ice cream kid.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.440
Follow my lead,
and we'll be jade in the shade.

19:11.526 --> 19:13.651
-[fischoeder] hello.
-[both] aah!

19:13.778 --> 19:16.487
You, uh, take any good
bootlegger tours lately?

19:16.573 --> 19:18.489
-Hmm. I-I don't think so.
-Heh. Yeah, I-I hate tours.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.366
You weren't scurrying
around under there

19:20.493 --> 19:22.410
Looking for my jade jellyfish,
were you?

19:22.495 --> 19:24.662
<i> Your</i> jade jellyfish?
That belonged to slippery sam.

19:24.747 --> 19:27.582
Um, if-- it-it would
if it-if it was still there,

19:27.709 --> 19:30.418
Or if I-- you know, I don't even
know what you're talking about.

19:30.545 --> 19:32.795
As owner of this property,
you should understand,

19:32.964 --> 19:35.548
If it were there,
it would belong to me.

19:35.633 --> 19:38.009
Unrelated: Have you got
something under your coat?

19:38.094 --> 19:39.760
-Her boobs?
-Three of them?
-Don't judge.

19:39.888 --> 19:42.930
-Come on, give it. Give it here.
-Sorry, hon.
-[groans]

19:43.016 --> 19:44.682
Oh, you're gonna make
fischy so much money.

19:44.809 --> 19:47.185
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.811
-Well, it's worth nothing.
-Wait, what?

19:48.897 --> 19:50.938
Yes, I had the jade jellyfish
appraised.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.940
And, oddly enough,
it's not made out of jade.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.942
-[groans]
-does it even have jelly in it?

19:55.069 --> 19:58.020
The dyed quartz jellyfish
would be a more accurate name.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.198
-Aw.
-There was a lot
of that going around

20:00.283 --> 20:02.408
Back in the jade craze days.

20:02.493 --> 20:05.286
But I sold it to that
rube manager at the hotel

20:05.371 --> 20:07.246
For him to use
as part of his tour.

20:07.332 --> 20:10.333
After some fierce negotiating,
we settled on $100.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.501
And since you found it,
I'm giving you half.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.170
Yes! I get 50 bucks.

20:14.255 --> 20:15.838
-Minus expenses.
-Expenses?

20:15.965 --> 20:18.341
I had to invest
in locks for the hatches

20:18.468 --> 20:20.301
To the under-pier,
thank you very much.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.136
And I had to get
a fun keychain for the keys.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.138
Look, it's a little palm tree.
Don't touch it.

20:24.224 --> 20:27.475
Anyway, I deducted those costs,
and this is for you.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.101
-$17.
-Okey dokey.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.978
-It's something.
-Now, be a lamb
and stop trespassing

20:31.022 --> 20:33.731
-On my property, okay?
-[gene] no!

20:33.858 --> 20:35.399
-Bye.
-Mom, we're pretty good at this.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.902
You know what I'm thinking?
You, me, lost city of atlantis.

20:38.029 --> 20:40.029
I bet it's in atlanta.
Has anyone looked there?

20:40.198 --> 20:42.782
I don't know. Maybe?
When's your spring break?

20:42.867 --> 20:44.909
Or maybe just find
some more, uh, you know,

20:44.994 --> 20:48.120
-Walking-distance treasures,
closer to...
-Don't be jealous.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.789
So louise, what are you gonna
spend your money on?

20:49.916 --> 20:52.458
I think I know
what I'm gonna do with it.
