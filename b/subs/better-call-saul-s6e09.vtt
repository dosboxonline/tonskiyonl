It's just...

37:03.180 --> 37:05.223
He just didn't seem

37:03.180 --> 37:05.223
like himself.

Are you hearing

37:05.223 --> 37:07.600

Howard was not on drugs.

That simply is not true.

I assumed the cleaning crew

37:46.514 --> 37:49.601
left it on by mistake.

And I was sure the office

was empty, so I didn't knock.

And?

38:02.989 --> 38:05.909
And Howard was there

38:02.989 --> 38:05.909
at his desk.

38:05.909 --> 38:07.160

I didn't know what to do,

neither of us

38:20.632 --> 38:22.634
said anything about it.

I never told anyone.

You knew him

I apologize.

Ms. Wexler, we are here today

42:12.113 --> 42:15.741
at your insistence,

42:15.741 --> 42:18.536
to consider your motion

42:15.741 --> 42:18.536
to exclude evidence,

42:18.536 --> 42:21.373
and this is the moment

42:18.536 --> 42:21.373

argue your motion
