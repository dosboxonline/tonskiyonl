42:41.267 --> 42:44.479

42:44.521 --> 42:46.231

42:46.272 --> 42:49.942
Well, because if they're willing

42:46.272 --> 42:49.942

42:49.984 --> 42:52.820

42:52.862 --> 42:55.156

50:38.995 --> 50:40.329

I will, why not--

50:40.371 --> 50:44.750

50:48.212 --> 50:52.174

50:48.212 --> 50:52.174

50:52.216 --> 50:54.927
But I will be mindful.

50:54.969 --> 50:56.721

You might.

52:21.889 --> 52:25.141

about the Greeks,

52:25.183 --> 52:27.853
the great tragedies

52:27.895 --> 52:31.231

52:53.169 --> 52:54.922
Good God no.

52:54.964 --> 52:57.675
She won't even remember me,

52:57.716 --> 53:00.136
and she'll have

52:57.716 --> 53:00.136
her mother

53:00.176 --> 53:03.514
to fill her

53:00.176 --> 53:03.514

53:03.555 --> 53:07.559
But Chuck...
