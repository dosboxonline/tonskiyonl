10:49.900 --> 10:53.528
"you're an idiot child not welcome
at the adult table" do you not understand?

10:53.612 --> 10:55.781
Oh, I thought you knew everything.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.657
Tek Knight invited me.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.743
We go way back.

11:00.869 --> 11:03.789
It's so good to see you here.

11:03.872 --> 11:07.000
...and The Whole Truth got picked up
for another season on Vought+.

11:07.084 --> 11:08.627
It's a hit.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.670
Must be, if you got all this.

11:10.754 --> 11:11.922
No, you--

11:12.005 --> 11:13.840
you don't get this
from entertainment money.

11:13.924 --> 11:15.217
This is real money.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.635
Eleven generations' money.

11:16.718 --> 11:17.636
Oh.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.138
The Vernon family started out
as slave catchers.

11:20.222 --> 11:25.143
Now we own more private prisons
than any other company in the U.S. of A.

11:25.227 --> 11:27.979
And you sure know how to fill them.

11:28.063 --> 11:31.108
From snout to tail, I catch, house,

11:31.191 --> 11:32.901
and rehab criminals, and then I catch them

11:32.984 --> 11:34.694
-all over again.
-[laughs]

11:34.778 --> 11:38.115
You know, I bet A-Train here would've
given my great-great-granddaddy

11:38.198 --> 11:39.366
-a run for his money. Ah?
-[Firecracker] Oh.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.410
But we would've caught you.

11:41.493 --> 11:45.122
-[Firecracker] Ooh. [laughs]
-[chuckling]

11:45.205 --> 11:47.416
I guess we'll never know.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.501
[intriguing music playing]

11:53.046 --> 11:54.673
[Mother's Milk] Come on out, kid.

11:54.756 --> 11:55.841
[Hughie] You guys are gonna laugh.

11:55.924 --> 11:57.551
No one is gonna laugh.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.344
[groans]

12:03.014 --> 12:04.724
[ragged exhale]

12:07.686 --> 12:08.562
[chuckling]

12:08.645 --> 12:11.565
Guys, come on. You-you promised.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.901
-[Annie] Oh, my God.
-[Hughie] Okay, you know what?

12:14.985 --> 12:16.361
Ah!

12:16.445 --> 12:17.487
Fuck you guys.

12:17.571 --> 12:18.780
[coughs]

12:19.781 --> 12:23.493
How did a junkie like Webweaver score
an invite to this anyway?

12:23.577 --> 12:26.371
Don't know.
But A-Train said he's on the list.

12:26.455 --> 12:28.957
God, why does he wear it
so tight? [sniffs]

12:29.040 --> 12:31.501
Smells like ass sweat
and broken dreams in here.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.920
Good, it'll hide your scent
from Tek Knight.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.172
You don't want to give him any tells.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.674
Wait. Tek Knight has super smell?

12:37.757 --> 12:41.011
Yeah. Smell, vision, taste, touch.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.346
-He's like Sherlock Holmes on meth.
-I don't like this.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.264
He's gonna make Hughie.

12:44.347 --> 12:46.475
[Mother's Milk] How else are we gonna
find out what Sage is cooking?

12:46.558 --> 12:48.560
Just got to work fast, kid.

12:48.643 --> 12:50.812
Take these bugs,
put 'em all over the party,

12:50.896 --> 12:52.731
and lure Tek Knight back here
as soon as you can.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.357
-Okay.
-We'll take care of the rest.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.775
[Annie] Oh, God.

12:55.859 --> 12:58.862
Okay. Comm check-ins every two minutes.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.739
Just say something, okay?

13:00.822 --> 13:02.032
-Anything.
-Yeah. Copy.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.700
In Webweaver's voice, motherfucker.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.744
Uh... [imitates Webweaver] Copy, dawg.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.162
Hey...

13:08.413 --> 13:09.664
I'm fine.

13:09.748 --> 13:11.333
All right? Trust me.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.628
[Annie] Okay.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.756
Ooh, that is... ripe.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.141
[Elijah] Webweaver.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.020
Master Knight's expecting you.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.314
He'll be thrilled.

13:34.397 --> 13:37.734
[clears throat] Yeah, uh, so am I, dawg.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.372
Fuck, oh, fuck. The Seven are here.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.960
[Mother's Milk over earpiece] Just
hurry up and plant the bugs, Hughie.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.634
-Oh, shit, I'm so sorry. I...
-Jesus fucking--

14:02.717 --> 14:03.718
Madam...

14:03.802 --> 14:06.263
-Vice President-elect.
-Oh, shit.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.722
[Hughie] Uh...

14:07.806 --> 14:10.559
[suspenseful music playing]

14:10.642 --> 14:11.810
Um...

14:14.229 --> 14:15.689
Webweaver.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.484
That's quite a scent.

14:19.568 --> 14:20.735
-Webweaver!
-[exclaims]

14:20.819 --> 14:22.153
You made it.

14:22.237 --> 14:25.407
Oh, it's so good
to meet you in person. Finally.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.658
Feels like I already know you.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.076
[Hughie] Yeah, I know. Me too.

14:28.159 --> 14:30.036
No... cap?

14:30.120 --> 14:33.248
Really, I'm honored that you would even
consider the sidekick gig.

14:33.331 --> 14:36.835
I know it's a big change,
but if tonight goes well...

14:37.919 --> 14:39.045
-...it's yours.
-Oh.

14:39.129 --> 14:40.922
Uh, w-well, great.

14:41.006 --> 14:44.509
-Mm-hmm.
-Um, that's... great.

14:44.593 --> 14:46.761
Well, you know, I've never been
to an estate before.

14:46.845 --> 14:48.430
-Mm.
-Um, do you guys have stables?

14:48.513 --> 14:50.223
[Tek-Knight laughing]

14:50.307 --> 14:52.934
Let's get the tour started inside.

14:53.018 --> 14:55.228
-Okay? Come on. [chuckles]
-[Hughie] Okay. Got it.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.231
[Sage] What happened to you?

14:58.315 --> 15:00.442
You look like you got ass-fucked
by the business end of a hammer.

15:00.525 --> 15:02.694
Well, maybe I don't want to be
at this CPAC nightmare

15:02.777 --> 15:04.362
any more than they want me here.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.489
There's gonna be
a little sidebar later on.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.450
One percent of the one percent.

15:08.533 --> 15:12.037
Sage here is going to lube them up
with cognac and Montecristos,

15:12.120 --> 15:15.165
and then convince them
to commit a little high treason.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.374
I'm sorry, what the fuck?

15:16.458 --> 15:18.418
Why would I expose myself like that?

15:18.501 --> 15:20.670
Because in this room
is 38% of the U.S. GDP.

15:20.754 --> 15:24.591
And if we have a shot in hell of pulling
off the 25th Amendment, we need them.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.718
Do you want to be el jefe or not?

15:29.763 --> 15:32.349
Good. Now, you're the virgin at prom.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.100
Go get finger-popped.

15:36.353 --> 15:37.479
Oh, hey.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.148
You hear about Stan Edgar?

15:41.191 --> 15:42.567
Well, what about him?

15:42.651 --> 15:45.445
Well, apparently,
he got released from prison.

15:47.614 --> 15:52.327
Hmm. Details are fairly sketchy as to why.

15:52.410 --> 15:56.164
How. But, yeah, he got out.

15:56.247 --> 15:58.291
Hasn't been seen since.

15:58.375 --> 15:59.793
Well, he's nothing if not slippery.

15:59.876 --> 16:02.003
I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner.

16:03.838 --> 16:06.007
He can't hurt us.

16:06.091 --> 16:08.134
Mm-hmm.

16:19.187 --> 16:21.690
That's why I went
to the Safdies to direct.

16:21.773 --> 16:23.316
[Mother's Milk] Okay, Hughie, check in.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.444
-No more PG-13 bullshit.
-Oh, wow, I love these,
uh, these orchid prints

16:26.528 --> 16:28.780
in your... stairway.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.826
Oh, wow.

16:33.827 --> 16:36.996
I love your study. So many books.

16:37.080 --> 16:40.375
[Tek-Knight] Got the original
Beecher Stowe Uncle Tom's Cabin.

16:40.458 --> 16:41.501
-Cool.
-Mm-hmm.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.086
Cool, cool.

16:43.169 --> 16:46.923
Now, look, uh, I don't do this
for just anybody, but, uh...

16:47.006 --> 16:48.216
you want to see the Tek Cave?

16:48.299 --> 16:49.718
The Tek Ca-- Uh...

16:49.801 --> 16:52.679
S-Sure, I mean, uh, fuck yeah, dawg.

16:56.766 --> 16:59.644
Oh, it's one of those pull-the-book,
hidden-elevator-thingies.

16:59.728 --> 17:01.354
Like in my movies.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.398
-[Hughie] Like in your movies.
-Shit.

17:03.481 --> 17:04.983
Huh.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.408
[static]

17:13.491 --> 17:14.617
Hughie.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.829
[elevator bell dings]

17:17.912 --> 17:19.914
[birds fluttering]

17:22.292 --> 17:24.627
Oh, my God.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.754
Uh...

17:25.837 --> 17:28.298
Oh, wow.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.758
[water dripping]

17:31.259 --> 17:35.972
This is the Tek Cave. Cool, cool.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.224
[Tek-Knight] Ah, you've met Elijah.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.685
Raised me since I lost my parents.

17:40.769 --> 17:43.354
He's like a dad to me.

17:43.438 --> 17:44.856
Isn't that right, Elijah?

17:44.939 --> 17:47.442
That's correct, Master Knight.

17:49.110 --> 17:52.989
There's nothing greater
than a father's guiding hand.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.491
You know?

17:54.574 --> 17:56.743
That's for sure.

17:56.826 --> 18:00.914
Jesus. You didn't get all the santorum
off the gibbet cage!

18:00.997 --> 18:02.248
It'll be taken care of, sir.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.793
-[groans]
-Most certainly.

18:04.876 --> 18:07.128
-[static]
-We got to pull him out.

18:07.212 --> 18:09.798
No, no, no. Look, j-just hold on.

18:09.881 --> 18:11.174
[muffled groaning]

18:11.257 --> 18:12.884
-Uh...
-[moaning]

18:15.136 --> 18:17.138
[moaning]

18:17.222 --> 18:18.473
Who is that?

18:18.556 --> 18:19.933
That's my last sidekick.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.101
[pained moans]

18:22.185 --> 18:23.520
I don't like liars.

18:23.603 --> 18:27.106
The whole culture down here
is based on trust.

18:27.190 --> 18:28.650
Huh.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.362
[heart beating rapidly]

18:32.445 --> 18:34.030
Are you agitated?

18:34.113 --> 18:35.865
No, I'm fine.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.242
I get it.

18:37.325 --> 18:39.327
This is all a little vanilla for you.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.996
But... don't worry.

18:42.997 --> 18:45.583
Tonight, we're really
gonna push ourselves...

18:45.667 --> 18:48.461
[shaky inhale] ...to your level.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.673
[chains rattling]

18:51.756 --> 18:54.551
[Laddio grunting]

18:56.719 --> 18:58.471
[muffled speech]

19:01.933 --> 19:03.518
[Deep] Hey. Dude.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.728
Are you fucking nuts?

19:05.812 --> 19:07.272
Put your mask back on.

19:07.355 --> 19:09.732
G-Get out of his chair.
What are you doing?

19:09.816 --> 19:11.901
You know what's funny? I hate sake.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.529
But I'm supposed to follow
some stupid Black ninja bullshit,

19:14.612 --> 19:16.239
which makes no goddamn sense,
by the way.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.991
You ever meet a Black ninja?

19:18.074 --> 19:19.367
Lower your voice.

19:19.450 --> 19:20.702
There's nobody here.

19:20.785 --> 19:23.371
They left us like babies
so they could go do important stuff.

19:23.454 --> 19:24.956
-We don't matter.
-Hey.

19:25.039 --> 19:28.126
Speak for yourself.
I'm doing a ton of important shit.

19:28.209 --> 19:29.627
Yeah? Like what?

19:29.711 --> 19:32.505
Need-to-know, bro.
Need-to-fucking-know.

19:32.589 --> 19:34.799
Fuck it. I'm done with all this shit.

19:34.883 --> 19:36.092
You're quitting?

19:36.175 --> 19:38.636
What are you gonna do?
Seven's the biggest gig there is.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.388
Look, I don't understand Noir, okay?

19:40.471 --> 19:41.639
You know there was nothing in his closet

19:41.723 --> 19:45.268
but literally like seven file boxes
of shitty Buster Beaver drawings?

19:45.351 --> 19:46.644
Why'd he have that?

19:46.728 --> 19:47.770
Who the fuck knows or cares?

19:48.771 --> 19:51.816
[sighs] I'm going to Missouri tomorrow.

19:51.900 --> 19:55.361
I booked Cirque de Vought's new show,
VIVANT! Music of the Bee Gees.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.196
Three nights a week in Branson.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.823
They're gonna let me fly.

19:58.907 --> 20:00.491
I can fly, did you know that?

20:00.575 --> 20:04.078
Yeah, dude, we all know that.
Look, why didn't you just come to me?

20:05.038 --> 20:06.039
About what?

20:06.122 --> 20:08.291
Seriously? Dude.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.337
[sighs] Man, me and the old Noir?

20:12.420 --> 20:16.299
We were like great bros, like real bros.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.259
[sighs] Give me this.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.262
[glassware clinking]

20:22.221 --> 20:26.851
Few years ago, Noir cleared out
an entire Indonesian fishing village.

20:26.935 --> 20:29.729
Vought Fresh Farms was expanding
their palm oil plantation,

20:29.812 --> 20:31.773
but the locals were bitching
'cause they needed the river

20:31.856 --> 20:34.651
to survive or whatever the fuck.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.528
Noir "cancelled" two dozen of 'em.

20:37.612 --> 20:39.572
Came back with
a raging hard-on for a week.

20:39.656 --> 20:40.657
[chuckles]

20:40.740 --> 20:43.409
No, dude, see, what you're not getting

20:43.493 --> 20:47.580
is how horny killing made the old Noir.

20:47.664 --> 20:48.915
That was his whole thing.

20:48.998 --> 20:51.250
But I don't really like violence.

20:51.334 --> 20:53.544
[inhales, sighs]

20:55.713 --> 20:59.008
Look, I know this
is hard to imagine, but...

20:59.092 --> 21:00.468
some people laugh at me.

21:00.551 --> 21:02.011
[chuckles] It's crazy, right?

21:02.095 --> 21:03.221
Yeah.

21:04.389 --> 21:06.307
But you know what I realized?

21:06.391 --> 21:08.893
When I crush someone's nose
into the back of their skull

21:08.977 --> 21:12.188
or beat 'em so bad
that they'll never walk again?

21:12.271 --> 21:15.108
[chuckles] They're not laughing anymore.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.610
They show respect.
