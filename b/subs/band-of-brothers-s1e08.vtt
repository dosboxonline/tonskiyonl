WEBVTT

00:08.508 --> 00:11.886
(theme music playing)

02:29.691 --> 02:33.069
We had lost some
very good men there.

02:33.152 --> 02:36.573
Toye and Guarnere
had lost their legs there.

02:36.656 --> 02:40.159
Guarnere--
Gordon was badly hit.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.871
A number of other people
were killed.

02:42.954 --> 02:46.082
It was a difficult
situation there.

02:46.165 --> 02:48.751
I don't know
the exact amount of men

02:48.835 --> 02:51.588
that got killed
in that,

02:51.671 --> 02:53.798
but six, seven of 'em

02:53.882 --> 02:56.301
were real close
friends of mine.

02:57.552 --> 02:59.596
Skip Muck died.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.222
And Eugene Roe
came to me,

03:01.306 --> 03:04.851
about 10 minutes
after he was killed,

03:04.934 --> 03:08.897
and he wanted me
to see if I wanted
to go look at him,

03:08.980 --> 03:11.232
and I said, no, I wouldn't
be able to stand that.

03:11.316 --> 03:13.192
So I didn't go look
at him.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.069
After Bastogne,
we went to Haguenau.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.572
There was another push there.
We wanted to get some idea

03:17.655 --> 03:20.783
what was across
the river there, what kind
of strength they had.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.620
You have a feeling
you're gonna live
through the war.

03:23.703 --> 03:28.374
You have a feeling
it's starting to ease off.

03:28.458 --> 03:32.170
You can't account for it.
It's just a gut feeling,

03:32.253 --> 03:34.464
but everybody had
that feeling--

03:34.547 --> 03:38.635
"I believe I might be able
to live through,"

03:38.718 --> 03:42.680
so walk carefully,
take care of yourself.

04:05.536 --> 04:08.164
(distant explosions)

04:08.247 --> 04:10.959
Webster:
<i>The 101st Airborne</i>
<i>had been made famous</i>

04:11.042 --> 04:13.252
<i>by what it did</i>
<i>in the Battle of the Bulge.</i>

04:13.336 --> 04:16.547
<i>Newspapers called them</i>
<i>"The Battered Bastards</i>
<i>of Bastogne."</i>

04:16.631 --> 04:18.675
<i>They'd been through</i>
<i>hell on earth</i>

04:18.758 --> 04:21.094
<i>and were now pulling into</i>
<i>the comparative paradise</i>
<i>of Haguenau,</i>

04:21.177 --> 04:25.014
<i>the sounds of the war</i>
<i>still coming from just</i>
<i>across the river.</i>

04:25.098 --> 04:26.975
<i>I had missed</i>
<i>Bastogne.</i>

04:27.058 --> 04:28.935
<i>All I knew was</i>
<i>what I'd read</i>

04:29.018 --> 04:30.937
<i>and heard around</i>
<i>the replacement depot--</i>

04:31.020 --> 04:32.647
<i>that we had broken</i>
<i>the back of the enemy</i>

04:32.730 --> 04:34.357
<i>and the war</i>
<i>would soon be over.</i>

04:34.440 --> 04:36.234
Thanks for the lift.

04:36.317 --> 04:39.153
<i>When I was finally able</i>
<i>to rejoin Easy Company,</i>

04:39.237 --> 04:41.155
<i>they looked nothing</i>
<i>like the heroes</i>

04:41.239 --> 04:43.658
<i>who had just helped</i>
<i>win the war.</i>

04:46.119 --> 04:48.746
George Luz!

04:46.119 --> 04:48.746
Yeah?

04:48.830 --> 04:52.125
It's me.
Oh, come on, I haven't
been gone that long.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.627
Jesus.
Yes, you have.

04:56.629 --> 04:59.090
Now look
what I've found.
Hey, guys.

04:59.173 --> 05:01.092
Sergeant Martin.

05:01.175 --> 05:03.136
What do you want,
Private?

05:03.219 --> 05:05.013
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

05:05.096 --> 05:08.307
My name's David Webster.
I just got back from
the hospital.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.435
Good for you.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.397
Where's the rest
of the guys?

05:14.480 --> 05:16.357
This is everybody.

05:16.441 --> 05:19.861
Oh, come on,
Sergeant Martin.
This can't be everybody.

05:19.944 --> 05:21.529
What about, uh,

05:21.612 --> 05:23.906
Hoobler?
Where's he?

05:26.576 --> 05:28.369
Lieutenant Foley,

05:28.453 --> 05:30.872
2nd Platoon, lost more
guys than we did.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.874
They're really
short-handed.

05:32.957 --> 05:34.959
Yeah, right.
Report to 2nd, Webster.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.586
They'll find
a place for you.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.338
Next truck up, Webster,
you'll find 2nd. Move.

05:52.643 --> 05:54.604
Hey, guys.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.690
Some lieutenant told me
to report to 2nd.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.446
Your name's Jackson,
right?

06:03.529 --> 06:05.073
That's right.

06:05.156 --> 06:07.241
Who's leading
the platoon?

06:07.325 --> 06:09.410
Sergeant Malarkey is.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.913
What, no officers?

06:09.494 --> 06:11.913
I guess you didn't hear.

06:11.996 --> 06:13.748
No. What's that?

06:13.831 --> 06:16.709
They're making
Malarkey a lieutenant.
He's on the fast track now.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.544
Really?
That's great.

06:18.628 --> 06:19.796
Yeah, isn't it?

06:19.879 --> 06:22.632
Yeah.
Jackson, help me up,
will you?

06:30.431 --> 06:33.309
So, uh, you come
from the hospital?

06:33.392 --> 06:34.477
Yeah.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.104
Must've liked
that hospital,

06:36.187 --> 06:39.023
'cause we left Holland
four months ago.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.691
Well, I wasn't there
the whole time.

06:40.775 --> 06:43.986
There was rehabilitation,
then the replacement depot.

06:44.070 --> 06:47.115
Well, I'm sure you tried
to bust out and help us
in Bastogne, Web.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.492
I don't know how
I would have done that.

06:49.575 --> 06:52.286
That's funny,
'cause Popeye found a way.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.413
So did Alley, right,
back in Holland?

06:54.497 --> 06:55.998
And Guarnere and--

06:56.082 --> 06:58.709
Yeah, where is Guarnere?
He still your platoon
sergeant?

06:58.793 --> 07:00.795
No.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.795
Man: Let's go!

07:00.878 --> 07:03.214
He got hit.

07:00.878 --> 07:03.214
Yeah?

07:03.297 --> 07:05.216
Yeah.
Yeah, Bill got hit.

07:05.299 --> 07:06.884
Blew his whole
leg off.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.095
Man:
1st Platoon,
moving out!

07:12.765 --> 07:15.184
Spread out.
Hold along this line

07:15.268 --> 07:17.353
till I figure out
where we're going.

07:17.436 --> 07:18.688
Sarge.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.314
Sarge.

07:20.398 --> 07:23.818
(explosions)

07:29.448 --> 07:31.450
What's the matter
there, Webster?

07:31.534 --> 07:33.411
Nervous in the service?

07:33.494 --> 07:35.788
No, no, I'm fine,
Sarge.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.832
Why don't you go talk
to Captain Speirs,

07:37.915 --> 07:39.500
make sure he wants
you with us.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.210
Captain Speirs?

07:41.294 --> 07:42.879
What happened
to Captain Winters?

07:42.962 --> 07:45.548
He's running the whole
battalion now. Go.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.758
Webster:
<i>So Easy Company</i>
<i>had a new CO</i>

07:47.842 --> 07:49.844
<i>to go along with</i>
<i>all the other new faces.</i>

07:49.927 --> 07:51.804
<i>The guys I knew</i>
<i>were either gone</i>

07:51.888 --> 07:54.182
<i>or very different</i>
<i>from what I remembered.</i>

07:54.265 --> 07:56.225
<i>I was a veteran of D-Day</i>
<i>and Market Garden</i>

07:56.309 --> 07:58.686
<i>and had been</i>
<i>with the company</i>
<i>since its formation,</i>

07:58.769 --> 08:00.730
<i>but now, because</i>
<i>I had missed Bastogne,</i>

08:00.813 --> 08:02.690
<i>I was treated</i>
<i>as a replacement</i>

08:02.773 --> 08:05.026
<i>and felt like I was</i>
<i>starting all over again.</i>

08:05.109 --> 08:07.778
Hey, look who it is.
Nice digs, huh, Lip?

08:07.862 --> 08:09.697
Yeah.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.697
Sergeant Lipton?

08:09.780 --> 08:12.158
Hey, look what I found.

08:09.780 --> 08:12.158
Feeling all right?

08:12.241 --> 08:14.076
There you go.
He's got pneumonia.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.370
I'm sorry to hear that.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.370
What are you sorry about?

08:16.454 --> 08:18.539
He's alive.
He's got a couch,
a goddamn blanket,

08:18.623 --> 08:20.041
snug as a bug.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.041
Yeah.

08:20.124 --> 08:23.586
Sergeant Malarkey said
to check with the CO

08:23.669 --> 08:25.129
if I should be
in 2nd Platoon.

08:25.213 --> 08:27.840
Have a seat, Webster.
We'll get you situated.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.926
(distant explosions)

08:30.009 --> 08:32.303
How long have you
been sick?

08:32.386 --> 08:35.473
Long enough.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.809
He wants us
to cross the river.

08:38.893 --> 08:41.562
Yeah, I bet
that water's cold.

08:41.646 --> 08:43.898
Should be able
to get you some boats.

08:44.982 --> 08:47.485
Had to be a full moon.

08:47.568 --> 08:50.613
So much for
the cover of darkness.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.449
It's gonna leave
the patrol exposed.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.037
Is this the company CP
for Easy?

08:58.120 --> 08:59.538
Yes, sir.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.624
As you were.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.751
Lieutenant Jones
looking for Captain Speirs.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.295
He's on his way, sir.
Why don't you sit down?

09:06.379 --> 09:08.422
Can you get me
a coffee?

09:08.506 --> 09:10.049
Would you like
a coffee, sir?

09:10.132 --> 09:12.301
No, thank you.

09:10.132 --> 09:12.301
All right.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.307
What platoon
are you in?

09:18.391 --> 09:21.394
Oh, we're about
to find that out.

09:21.477 --> 09:23.479
You got any soap?
I need a shave.

09:23.562 --> 09:25.356
I'll send some down.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.316
You know what you're
gonna do for this?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.318
I'm gonna let Speirs
handle it.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.318
Right.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.279
Captain Speirs,

09:31.362 --> 09:33.114
sir, this is
Lieutenant Jones.

09:33.197 --> 09:35.825
Listen, for Christ's sake,
will you go back in the back
and sack out?

09:35.908 --> 09:38.286
There's some beds back there
with fresh sheets.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.286
I will, sir.

09:38.369 --> 09:41.622
I was just trying
to make myself useful, sir.

09:41.706 --> 09:45.001
Listen up.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.378
Regiment wants
a patrol for prisoners.

09:47.461 --> 09:49.588
This one comes straight
from Colonel Sink,

09:49.672 --> 09:51.591
so it's not my idea.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.342
Since the river's
the main line
of resistance,

09:53.426 --> 09:55.344
we're gonna
have to cross it
to get to them.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.887
What do we need
to do?

09:56.971 --> 09:58.973
There's a three-story
building on the enemy side,

09:59.056 --> 10:01.183
up the embankment.
We know it's occupied.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.185
You can have 15 men.
Think very hard

10:03.269 --> 10:05.187
about who you want
to lead the patrol.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.356
You'll need a lead scout,
a translator.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.359
I've got
the entire battalion
on covering fire.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.527
When?

10:11.610 --> 10:13.654
Tonight, 0100.

10:11.610 --> 10:13.654
Yes, sir.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.615
Speirs, I want this one
to be as foolproof and
as safe as possible.

10:16.699 --> 10:18.784
Yeah, don't take
any chances on this one.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.328
We're too far along
for that.

10:20.411 --> 10:23.873
Speirs, want to discuss
who might go along?

10:23.956 --> 10:25.499
Who are you?

10:25.583 --> 10:28.002
Lieutenant Jones, sir.

10:28.085 --> 10:30.755
Right, our West Pointer.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.882
Yes, sir.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.882
When'd you graduate?

10:32.965 --> 10:34.717
June 6th, sir.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.219
June 6th
of last year?

10:37.303 --> 10:38.888
D-Day, yes, sir.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.681
(chuckles)

10:40.765 --> 10:43.142
All right,
don't get hurt.

10:43.225 --> 10:45.936
Sir, I'd like
to volunteer
for the patrol.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.649
Speirs, talk to you
in an hour.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.025
Yeah.

10:51.108 --> 10:52.943
Lieutenant Jones.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.446
We're short
an officer, so we--

10:55.529 --> 10:57.448
you think a noncom
could lead this?

10:57.531 --> 11:00.701
I can think of a few
possibilities.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.912
Martin, Malarkey,
Grant?

11:02.995 --> 11:05.539
Honestly, sir,
most of the NCOs
could use a rest.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.959
Captain, request permission
to go on the patrol.

11:09.043 --> 11:12.129
There's your answer.

11:12.213 --> 11:15.091
No. You don't have
any experience.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.093
Report to 2nd Platoon.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.344
Yes, sir.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.054
Tell--

11:21.013 --> 11:23.015
tell Heffron,

11:23.099 --> 11:24.767
Ramirez and McClung
they're going.

11:24.850 --> 11:25.935
Yes, sir.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.646
Sir, this is
Private Webster.

11:28.729 --> 11:31.399
Sir, I'm Private Webster
from 1st Platoon.

11:31.482 --> 11:33.442
I just got back
from the hospital

11:33.526 --> 11:35.319
and Lieutenant Foley

11:35.403 --> 11:37.530
told me to go to 2nd,
but Sergeant Malarkey said--

11:37.613 --> 11:39.740
Fine, 2nd.
Take...

11:39.824 --> 11:41.367
Lieutenant Jones.

11:41.450 --> 11:44.703
...Lieutenant, OP Two.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.794
Come on.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.300
(gunshots)

11:58.384 --> 12:00.302
Are there other officers
in the platoon?

12:00.386 --> 12:02.388
No, sir.
Just Sergeant Malarkey.

12:02.471 --> 12:05.433
But they tell me he's getting
a battlefield commission.

12:05.516 --> 12:08.519
Maybe he'll be
assisting you, sir.

12:08.602 --> 12:11.397
Who's that?
Webster?

12:11.480 --> 12:13.983
That's right.
How are you doing,
Sergeant Kiehn?

12:14.066 --> 12:15.651
Hi, Webster.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.651
Hey, Sarge.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.903
Hey, look what
we just scrounged.
We got some spuds.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.072
Hey, OP Two--
this way?

12:20.156 --> 12:22.491
Shit, go, go!

12:20.156 --> 12:22.491
Shit, move!

12:25.369 --> 12:28.539
Shit, they spotted us.

12:25.369 --> 12:28.539
Is that it?

12:28.622 --> 12:30.249
I don't know.
I think so.

12:30.332 --> 12:31.834
Go, go, go!

12:35.713 --> 12:37.298
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.467
Get over here.
Get over here.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.013
Man:
All clear!
All clear!

12:44.096 --> 12:46.140
Okay.
Okay.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.733
Ready?

12:57.401 --> 13:00.029
Wait, wait.
It was Heffron,
McClung and--

13:00.112 --> 13:01.989
Ramirez. Come on.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.989
Right.

13:04.241 --> 13:07.328
Hey, guys.
This taken?

13:07.411 --> 13:09.121
Go ahead.

13:11.999 --> 13:15.461
Sergeant, this is
Lieutenant Jones,

13:15.544 --> 13:17.254
just assigned
to 2nd Platoon.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.215
Malarkey, Platoon Sergeant.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.717
Congratulations on
the battlefield commission.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.553
The what?

13:24.637 --> 13:27.306
They're making you
an officer, no?

13:27.389 --> 13:28.682
Me? No.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.768
You must be thinking
of 1st Sergeant Lipton.

13:30.851 --> 13:32.895
My mistake.

13:32.978 --> 13:35.356
So you're without
a platoon leader?

13:35.439 --> 13:37.525
No, not anymore,
Lieutenant.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.778
Right.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.451
So you want
to introduce me
to the men?

13:49.119 --> 13:51.622
Well, some are
sleeping downstairs.

13:51.705 --> 13:54.458
The rest are right here.

13:58.045 --> 14:00.839
Sergeant, a patrol's
being planned for tonight

14:00.923 --> 14:03.676
0100 hours,
across the river.

14:03.759 --> 14:06.720
Regiment wants POWs
for interrogation.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.682
What's the situation?

14:09.765 --> 14:11.350
Hey, Web.

14:09.765 --> 14:11.350
What?

14:11.433 --> 14:14.186
Come here.
I want to talk to you
for a second. Come here.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.605
Why?

14:14.270 --> 14:16.605
You want some coffee?

14:16.689 --> 14:17.982
No.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.525
15.

14:19.608 --> 14:20.818
15 what?

14:20.901 --> 14:22.695
Louies since D-Day.

14:22.778 --> 14:24.613
Any mortars?

14:22.778 --> 14:24.613
60s, out back.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.907
Is this kid
out of high school yet?

14:26.991 --> 14:28.993
He's out of West Point.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.993
West Point?

14:29.076 --> 14:30.911
Isn't that
where Ike went?

14:30.995 --> 14:33.455
Yeah, he actually
graduated with his son.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.666
Shit, so...

14:35.749 --> 14:39.253
what do you know
about this patrol thing?

14:39.336 --> 14:41.130
Uh, nothing.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.465
Oh, come on, Web.
You gotta know something.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.426
I don't.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.426
Bullshit.

14:45.509 --> 14:47.761
You were there, right?
At the CP?

14:47.845 --> 14:49.805
This is a prisoner snatch,
right?

14:49.888 --> 14:52.683
Hey, Chuck,
listen to this.

14:52.766 --> 14:56.270
Come on, Webster,
spill it.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.983
Captain Speirs
is to pick 15 men.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.526
Mm-hmm.

15:02.610 --> 15:05.571
Lieutenant Jones
wants to be one of them.

15:05.654 --> 15:08.407
I say let the kid go.
He could use the experience.

15:08.490 --> 15:12.161
Probably could
find 14 replacements
to help him out.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.622
I take it this was
already an outpost
when you arrived?

15:14.705 --> 15:17.833
Mm, there were some doggies
from the 79th Infantry,

15:17.916 --> 15:19.460
but they left
in a hurry.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.754
What's the report
on enemy activity?

15:21.837 --> 15:24.214
Expect some flares,
a few mortars at night,

15:24.298 --> 15:26.008
scattered 88s,
snipers during the day.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.469
Yeah, we dodged some
mortars on our way in.

15:28.552 --> 15:31.013
Mm.

15:31.096 --> 15:35.225
They also got some
sort of railroad gun
back there,

15:35.309 --> 15:37.811
shells about the size
of a deuce and a half.

15:37.895 --> 15:40.564
Sounds like a freight train
when one comes over.

15:40.648 --> 15:43.275
But they haven't
made any attempts
to cross the river?

15:43.359 --> 15:45.069
No.

15:45.152 --> 15:47.988
They have roofs
over their heads, sir,
just like us.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.324
I don't think anybody wants
to do anything stupid

15:50.407 --> 15:52.368
at this point, right?

15:52.451 --> 15:54.328
Why are you
holding out on me?
I know you know.

15:54.411 --> 15:56.080
Just give us
the names, Web.

15:56.163 --> 15:58.666
Who?

15:58.749 --> 16:01.752
There are three men
here in this room

16:01.835 --> 16:04.046
that they think
should be on
the patrol.

16:06.256 --> 16:07.591
Who?

16:09.218 --> 16:11.095
Well, if I tell you,

16:11.178 --> 16:13.055
you can't let on
that you know.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.807
Your secret's safe, Web.

16:14.890 --> 16:17.059
Who is it?

16:21.563 --> 16:23.440
Yeah, Heffron.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.025
Aw, shit.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.444
McClung...

16:29.405 --> 16:30.698
and you.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.953
He want any other guys
from any other platoon?

16:36.036 --> 16:38.205
No, no. I don't know.
Not that I know of.

16:38.288 --> 16:41.542
Look, that's all I know,
I'm sorry.

16:41.625 --> 16:45.754
So it's McClung,
Heffron and Ramirez.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.424
I'll tell them.
I just need you to--

16:48.507 --> 16:50.008
Listen up!

16:50.092 --> 16:52.136
Got some bad news.

16:54.555 --> 16:57.057
There is a patrol
set for tonight.

16:57.141 --> 16:59.268
And so far,
Speirs wants McClung--

16:59.351 --> 17:01.437
We know.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.437
Yeah, we just fucking heard.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.106
Webster here told us.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.106
(phone rings)

17:05.274 --> 17:07.234
Easy, White.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.571
Yep.
Uh-huh.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.492
Okay.
All right, out.

17:15.576 --> 17:17.995
The PX rations
just came in,

17:18.078 --> 17:20.748
including winter shoe pacs.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.748
Beautiful.

17:20.831 --> 17:23.959
Yeah, finally, right?

17:20.831 --> 17:23.959
Good of 'em, now we're
in a nice, warm house.

17:24.042 --> 17:26.837
Also, we get showers.

17:24.042 --> 17:26.837
Mm.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.630
(explosion)

17:28.714 --> 17:32.009
All right, let's move!
Clear it out!
Move, move!

17:35.804 --> 17:37.055
Incoming!

17:37.139 --> 17:38.807
Come on, come on,
come on, go!

17:38.891 --> 17:40.517
Stay down!
Stay low, stay low!

17:43.395 --> 17:46.315
(laughing)

17:53.947 --> 17:56.408
Showers, let's go,
come on.

18:01.538 --> 18:04.041
(explosion)

18:05.834 --> 18:08.212
Man: Somebody's been hit!

18:05.834 --> 18:08.212
Man #2: Where?

18:10.339 --> 18:12.299
What happened?

18:10.339 --> 18:12.299
Casualty.

18:12.382 --> 18:14.551
Who is it?

18:12.382 --> 18:14.551
Bill Kiehn.

18:15.928 --> 18:19.389
I just left him.
I was on my way back.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.976
Webster:
<i>In war, soldiers</i>
<i>sometimes die</i>

18:23.060 --> 18:24.895
<i>in the fever pitch</i>
<i>of a firefight</i>

18:24.978 --> 18:27.606
<i>or by artillery</i>
<i>when they're huddled</i>
<i>in a foxhole.</i>

18:27.689 --> 18:29.399
<i>Bill Kiehn, a Toccoa man,</i>

18:29.483 --> 18:32.110
<i>was killed</i>
<i>because he was carrying</i>
<i>a sack of potatoes</i>

18:32.194 --> 18:34.446
<i>from one building</i>
<i>into another--</i>

18:34.530 --> 18:36.490
<i>in the wrong place</i>
<i>at the wrong time.</i>

18:36.573 --> 18:38.534
Christenson,
Jackson...

18:38.617 --> 18:41.245
<i>He was dead</i>
<i>before Doc Roe even heard</i>
<i>the call for a medic.</i>

18:41.328 --> 18:43.956
Get him out of here,
will you?

18:44.039 --> 18:46.250
Hey, let's go.
Let's get out of here.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.377
Yeah, okay.

18:54.007 --> 18:56.260
Did you know him well?

18:56.343 --> 18:58.637
No, not really.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.115
McClung.

19:18.198 --> 19:19.449
Thanks.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.371
Malarkey.

19:27.291 --> 19:30.335
(speaks indistinctly)

19:30.419 --> 19:33.422
...Jackson, Wynn, Liebgott,
Powers and Webster.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.215
All right?

19:37.301 --> 19:39.970
2nd Platoon, on me.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.645
All right, I'm leading
this patrol.

19:49.605 --> 19:52.232
The CO wants Grant,

19:52.316 --> 19:55.235
Liebgott, Wynn,

19:55.319 --> 19:57.863
Jackson, Shifty
from 3rd Platoon,

19:57.946 --> 19:59.281
and Webster.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.241
They want anyone from 1st?

19:59.364 --> 20:01.241
No.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.243
Is there anyone
they don't want
from 2nd?

20:03.327 --> 20:04.786
Jesus Christ.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.539
That list sounds
like everybody to me.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.833
It's always 2nd Platoon.
I swear to God,

20:09.917 --> 20:12.586
if we were down to three
guys, they'd still
want us for it.

20:12.669 --> 20:14.671
I can't believe
they're gonna make
Malarkey lead it.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.381
Christ, he only lost
his five best friends.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.300
What the fuck's
he gotta live for?

20:18.383 --> 20:21.595
Has it been a long time
since your last shower,
Professor?

20:32.230 --> 20:33.315
Come on.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.734
Man:
Is it hot water
or cold?

20:38.820 --> 20:41.782
Man: Hurry up, will ya?

20:38.820 --> 20:41.782
Man #2: All right.

20:54.461 --> 20:56.505
I guess I don't really
need a shower.

20:56.588 --> 20:59.174
I don't either.

20:59.257 --> 21:01.009
Lieutenant.

20:59.257 --> 21:01.009
Yeah?

21:01.093 --> 21:03.178
You still want
to get your ODs dirty?

21:03.261 --> 21:05.013
Of course.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.099
I was just thinking,

21:07.182 --> 21:10.978
Sergeant Malarkey's
really in no condition
to be on this patrol.

21:11.061 --> 21:14.147
And maybe if you offered,
you could go in his place,

21:14.231 --> 21:16.316
being that you are
an officer.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.318
No, they want someone
with experience.

21:18.402 --> 21:20.821
The guys they picked
have plenty of that.

21:28.328 --> 21:30.872
Webster:
<i>Lieutenant Jones wanted</i>
<i>to experience combat</i>

21:30.956 --> 21:32.791
<i>before the war</i>
<i>was over.</i>

21:32.874 --> 21:34.793
<i>Don Malarkey had been</i>
<i>on the front lines</i>

21:34.876 --> 21:37.796
<i>every time Easy Company</i>
<i>had seen action</i>
<i>since D-Day.</i>

21:37.879 --> 21:41.216
<i>If it was possible</i>
<i>for them to switch places</i>
<i>for the patrol,</i>

21:41.299 --> 21:43.260
<i>it would be a small</i>
<i>moment of justice,</i>

21:43.343 --> 21:46.763
<i>as welcome as a hot shower</i>
<i>and a fresh uniform.</i>

21:46.847 --> 21:50.809
<i>The decision, though,</i>
<i>was not theirs to make.</i>

21:53.061 --> 21:55.981
God damn it, Johnny,
you're breaking my heart,
I'm telling you.

21:56.064 --> 21:57.357
Come on, George,
just give me,

21:57.441 --> 21:59.192
I don't know,
10, 15 bars.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.819
Here you go.
Juicy Fruit, happy?

22:00.902 --> 22:02.571
We just got a report
of movement.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.781
1st Sergeant Lipton
wants you to lay a few
bazooka rounds

22:04.865 --> 22:06.324
into a house
across the river.

22:06.408 --> 22:08.076
You'd think we could get
at least one Hershey bar.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.870
Come on, Luz,
you're 1st Platoon
at heart.

22:09.953 --> 22:12.205
Jesus, Cobb,
there's not enough.

22:09.953 --> 22:12.205
Whoa, Hershey bars!

22:12.289 --> 22:14.624
Jesus Christ.

22:12.289 --> 22:14.624
Wait your turn,
Liebgott.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.418
Who are they for?

22:14.708 --> 22:16.418
Not you, Lieb.

22:16.501 --> 22:18.003
Oh, come on,
George, one bar.

22:18.086 --> 22:19.796
No, there's not enough
to go around!

22:19.880 --> 22:22.591
Captain Speirs here?

22:19.880 --> 22:22.591
Down by the river, sir.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.426
Perconte:
Hey, Big Mouth,

22:24.509 --> 22:26.178
give the kid
a Hershey bar, huh?

22:26.261 --> 22:28.388
You gotta be shittin' me!

22:26.261 --> 22:28.388
Look who it is.

22:28.472 --> 22:31.016
What's up, guys?
I like what you did
with the place, George.

22:31.099 --> 22:33.185
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I did good, huh?
How you feeling?

22:33.268 --> 22:35.270
As long as you keep
your hands off my ass,
I'll be fine.

22:35.353 --> 22:36.897
Have a Hershey's.

22:35.353 --> 22:36.897
Thanks.

22:36.980 --> 22:38.482
Hey, he gets a fucking
Hershey bar?

22:38.565 --> 22:40.358
Well, he got shot
in the ass.

22:40.442 --> 22:42.402
Did I tell you
to stick your big ass
out in the wind?

22:42.486 --> 22:44.571
No, but I expect a little
sympathy from you.
Right?

22:44.654 --> 22:46.740
I should rub it for you?
Hey, can you believe
this guy?

22:46.823 --> 22:49.242
Try to get him
out of the fucking war,
he comes straight back.

22:49.326 --> 22:50.911
Yeah, well, that's not
what I heard.

22:50.994 --> 22:52.496
I head the Krauts
are finished.

22:52.579 --> 22:54.331
Yeah, well,
just to make sure,

22:54.414 --> 22:56.583
we've got to row across
the fucking river tonight,

22:56.666 --> 22:59.044
grab a few
and ask 'em in person.

22:59.127 --> 23:01.046
Are you kidding me?

23:01.129 --> 23:02.798
Wish I was.
Welcome back, Frank.

23:02.881 --> 23:05.092
Oh, Jesus,
that reminds me, Web.

23:05.175 --> 23:07.219
I need you to run these
to OP Two for me--

23:07.302 --> 23:09.262
grenade launchers for
the night patrol, huh?

23:09.346 --> 23:11.765
Any day now, Web.
There you go.

23:11.848 --> 23:13.391
Hey, you know what?
Send these too.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.310
Hey, hey, hey.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.310
You been working out?

23:15.394 --> 23:17.479
Did you hear what
happened on D Company's
patrol last night?

23:17.562 --> 23:19.356
What?

23:17.562 --> 23:19.356
Replacement lieutenant

23:19.439 --> 23:21.233
blew his foot off,
stepped on a Schu-mine.

23:21.316 --> 23:23.819
Fresh in from West Point.
Had to come back
empty-handed.

23:23.902 --> 23:27.114
No shit.
Maybe he's a friend
of yours, Lieutenant.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.074
Cobb:
Hey, Vest, what you got
in there?

23:29.157 --> 23:30.784
More Hershey bars
and Lucky Strikes

23:30.867 --> 23:32.828
for you rear echelon fucks
to hoard, huh?

23:32.911 --> 23:34.704
Hey, hey, Cobb,
with the mouth, please.

23:34.788 --> 23:36.748
The kid's just trying
to do his job, all right?

23:36.832 --> 23:39.209
Jesus Chr-- you know what?
To hell with it.

23:39.292 --> 23:42.170
Count 'em up, Vest.
I gotta go blast this house.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.339
You happy now?

23:42.254 --> 23:44.339
You coming, Perco?

23:44.423 --> 23:47.259
Make yourself useful,
watch this shit for me.
Web, you come with me.

23:47.342 --> 23:49.511
Sergeant, is Captain Speirs
gonna be where you're headed?

23:49.594 --> 23:51.847
Same vicinity, yeah.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.847
All right,
then I'll join you.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.431
Where are we going?

23:53.515 --> 23:55.016
To the house
I gotta blast.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.018
Captain Winters
gonna be with him?

23:57.102 --> 23:59.813
Jesus, what--?
I don't know.
Maybe.

23:59.896 --> 24:01.648
Then I'm coming too.

23:59.896 --> 24:01.648
All right, come on,
guys, please.

24:01.731 --> 24:03.984
I've been here
all fucking day.
Give me a bar.

24:04.067 --> 24:05.694
I'm supposed
to watch these.

24:05.777 --> 24:09.030
You don't even smoke
cigarettes, damn it.
I got a wounded ass.

24:09.114 --> 24:12.242
Winters:
Intelligence give you
any information on the CP?

24:12.325 --> 24:14.161
Third house
on the left.

24:14.244 --> 24:16.163
As soon as our men
are back in the boats,

24:16.246 --> 24:17.831
I want a Quad 50
opening up.

24:17.914 --> 24:19.666
Captain Winters.

24:19.749 --> 24:23.086
About the patrol--
I feel that I should go
on the patrol, sir.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.297
I know I could use
the experience.

24:26.381 --> 24:28.717
Denied.
Anything else?

24:28.800 --> 24:32.304
You're not gonna
lead that patrol,
Lieutenant Jones.

24:36.808 --> 24:39.352
Permission to speak, sir.

24:41.688 --> 24:43.273
Go on, Lieutenant.

24:43.356 --> 24:46.109
It looks like
Sergeant Malarkey
could use a break, sir.

24:46.193 --> 24:48.653
I've discussed it with him
and he said that
he did not mind

24:48.737 --> 24:50.697
if I took his place
on the patrol.

24:50.780 --> 24:53.325
That was nice
of him.

24:55.785 --> 24:57.204
Captain Winters.

24:55.785 --> 24:57.204
Yes?

24:57.287 --> 25:00.165
I'd really like to be
on that patrol, sir.

25:00.248 --> 25:03.043
If it's true
the Krauts are finished,

25:03.126 --> 25:05.670
I haven't really done
anything

25:05.754 --> 25:09.090
except deliver mail and
type morning reports.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.301
Absolutely.

25:11.384 --> 25:13.345
Thank you,
Captain.

25:15.889 --> 25:18.099
He's got a point
about Sergeant Malarkey.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.810
Yeah, a point.

25:23.104 --> 25:25.232
Fine, you can go.

25:25.315 --> 25:27.317
There'll be a briefing,
CP, 1700.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.736
Yes, sir.

25:31.154 --> 25:33.031
So who do you have
in mind

25:33.114 --> 25:35.367
leading this thing,
if not Malarkey?

25:38.203 --> 25:40.372
Grant:
Come on,

25:40.455 --> 25:42.749
he can't be leading.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.920
I'm not sure
what they decided.

25:48.713 --> 25:50.757
No way.

25:50.840 --> 25:52.550
Not on his first day.

25:52.634 --> 25:55.470
Well, do you see
any other officer here?

26:08.358 --> 26:09.484
What?

26:09.567 --> 26:11.027
They call you guys too?

26:11.111 --> 26:14.489
So who's in charge
of this bullshit?

26:16.074 --> 26:17.951
Grant:
No, he ain't.

26:18.034 --> 26:20.161
Well, if he ain't,
it's you, Chuck,

26:20.245 --> 26:21.830
or Shifty or Mo.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.832
Well, that'd be better.

26:23.915 --> 26:25.542
10-hut!

26:25.625 --> 26:27.377
Jesus.

26:27.460 --> 26:29.004
At ease.

26:31.756 --> 26:33.341
Gentlemen.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.968
Sir.

26:35.051 --> 26:37.012
As you can see,
we've assembled
15 of you here

26:37.095 --> 26:39.347
for this prisoner snatch
tonight, 0100.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.349
Just a couple
of points--

26:41.433 --> 26:44.561
secured four rubber boats
to get you across the river.

26:44.644 --> 26:47.856
Lieutenant Jones here
is the ranking officer,

26:47.939 --> 26:49.941
and he'll be along
as an observer.

26:50.025 --> 26:52.652
Sergeant Martin here
will lead the patrol

26:52.736 --> 26:54.529
in Sergeant Malarkey's
place.

26:54.612 --> 26:57.198
The whole battalion
will be covering
your withdrawal.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.826
We've identified targets.
We've planned fire for 'em.

26:59.909 --> 27:01.911
We hear these whistles--
we open up.

27:01.995 --> 27:04.873
So don't blow 'em till
you're back in the boats
with your prisoners.

27:04.956 --> 27:07.125
And if the house
turns out to be
empty, sir?

27:07.208 --> 27:09.544
It won't.
But in any case,

27:09.627 --> 27:11.796
we know it's an outpost
and want it destroyed,

27:11.880 --> 27:13.840
so you have to lay
some demo on a time delay.

27:13.923 --> 27:16.885
You have to move fast
but carefully.

27:16.968 --> 27:19.554
Put a perimeter
around the house.
Once that's in place,

27:19.637 --> 27:21.514
get your rifle grenades
in the first-floor window.

27:21.598 --> 27:23.975
Get your
assault team in quick.
Okay, good, understood.

27:24.059 --> 27:26.186
Remember, it's about
prisoners.

27:26.269 --> 27:28.396
Don't pop the first thing
that moves.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.522
Clear?

27:29.606 --> 27:30.940
All:
Yes, sir.

27:31.024 --> 27:33.568
Good.

27:34.819 --> 27:36.696
Picked your
assault team?

27:36.780 --> 27:40.325
McClung, Sisk,
Cobb, Garcia,

27:40.408 --> 27:43.119
and Webster
as translator.

27:43.203 --> 27:45.497
The rest of you guys--
a base of fire

27:45.580 --> 27:47.540
with Sergeant Grant.

27:50.835 --> 27:53.463
You speak German,
right, Webster?

27:53.546 --> 27:55.882
Yeah, a little bit.

27:56.925 --> 27:58.093
Good.

27:58.176 --> 28:00.387
That's my team, sir.

28:00.470 --> 28:01.846
Questions?

28:01.930 --> 28:03.890
All:
No, sir.

28:03.973 --> 28:05.558
Good.

28:05.642 --> 28:07.268
Good luck.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.104
Thank you, sir.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.480
10-hut!

28:10.563 --> 28:12.607
As you were.
Carry on.

28:16.694 --> 28:19.239
A little German?

28:19.322 --> 28:21.699
His German's
as good as mine.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.833
Hey, Jackson,
you need this.

28:29.916 --> 28:31.626
Thanks.

28:31.709 --> 28:33.461
Can you believe
that guy?

28:33.545 --> 28:36.464
Webster, tries to get out
of everything.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.174
Whatever.

28:39.926 --> 28:42.095
I want four men
on each block.

28:44.180 --> 28:46.975
Four men to go in,
four men on the left
flank,

28:47.058 --> 28:49.060
four on the right.

28:47.058 --> 28:49.060
Sir, sir.

28:49.144 --> 28:50.228
Yes?

28:50.311 --> 28:52.689
Liebgott and I--
we both speak German.

28:52.772 --> 28:54.274
Yeah?

28:54.357 --> 28:56.401
You said 15 men.
There's 16 of us,

28:56.484 --> 28:58.111
including two
translators.

28:58.194 --> 28:59.779
Well, fine.
Hey, Liebgott,

28:59.863 --> 29:02.740
you want to sit
this one out?

29:02.824 --> 29:06.286
Yes, sir.
Thanks, buddy.

29:06.369 --> 29:09.247
Thank you, sir.

29:09.330 --> 29:11.666
...or the two fives?

29:09.330 --> 29:11.666
Yeah.

29:11.749 --> 29:15.503
Okay, you men going
on patrol-- Skinny--

29:15.587 --> 29:17.672
nothing rattles.
Nothing shines.

29:17.755 --> 29:19.757
No helmets.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.099
Lieutenant?

29:35.899 --> 29:37.692
Thank you.

29:52.081 --> 29:55.335
You set for tonight?

29:55.418 --> 29:56.544
I'm ready.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.838
Those Krauts are gonna
catch some hell.

29:58.922 --> 30:00.632
So I hear.

30:01.799 --> 30:04.719
I'm not personally
going in.

30:04.802 --> 30:06.721
It's Martin, right?

30:06.804 --> 30:09.224
Yeah, Martin and McClung.

30:09.307 --> 30:12.727
I'm supposed to
stay in the rear
and give them cover.

30:12.810 --> 30:15.146
It's the best
place to be.

30:16.439 --> 30:19.692
(explosions)

31:33.558 --> 31:36.644
Webster:
<i>15 men crossing a river</i>
<i>to capture prisoners</i>

31:36.728 --> 31:39.147
<i>from a German</i>
<i>observation post.</i>

31:39.230 --> 31:41.983
<i>Getting back safely</i>
<i>could be successfully</i>
<i>accomplished</i>

31:42.066 --> 31:44.235
<i>in as little</i>
<i>as 10 minutes.</i>

31:44.319 --> 31:46.195
<i>The same mission</i>
<i>could be met with disaster</i>

31:46.279 --> 31:48.865
<i>and result in nothing more</i>
<i>than 15 Americans killed</i>

31:48.948 --> 31:51.326
<i>or wounded</i>
<i>in action.</i>

31:51.409 --> 31:53.953
<i>Those of us</i>
<i>who had seen combat before</i>

31:54.037 --> 31:55.955
<i>put that</i>
<i>out of our minds.</i>

31:56.039 --> 31:58.166
<i>Those who hadn't</i>
<i>probably thought</i>
<i>of little else</i>

31:58.249 --> 32:01.169
<i>as we waited</i>
<i>for darkness.</i>

32:34.202 --> 32:36.079
Martin: Any problems?

32:34.202 --> 32:36.079
Christenson: No problems.

32:36.162 --> 32:38.831
It's secured to the tree.
No sign of any AP mines.

32:38.915 --> 32:41.292
Let's go.

32:49.008 --> 32:51.260
Webster, come on.

33:04.357 --> 33:06.818
(quietly)
Keep it steady.
Keep it steady.

33:10.029 --> 33:12.407
Oh, shit.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.242
I can't swim!

33:14.325 --> 33:17.745
Garcia, grab Sisk.

33:20.331 --> 33:22.709
Okay, keep going.
Come on, stay focused.

33:22.792 --> 33:24.502
Come on, come on.

33:29.006 --> 33:30.758
Use the rope.

33:31.926 --> 33:33.594
Come on.

33:38.224 --> 33:40.226
Cutters.

33:43.771 --> 33:45.523
Good.

33:45.606 --> 33:47.525
To the side.

33:47.608 --> 33:49.777
Let's go, come on.

33:51.237 --> 33:53.531
Clear.

33:55.116 --> 33:56.909
Easy now.

33:56.993 --> 33:58.619
Clear.

34:14.510 --> 34:17.638
Powers, go.
Go, McClung.

34:23.227 --> 34:25.438
McClung, move up.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.317
In twos, up.

34:57.678 --> 35:00.014
Powers, Wynn,
secure the left flank.

35:00.097 --> 35:03.184
Lieutenant, take Grant
and Heffron,

35:03.267 --> 35:06.103
secure the right perimeter
and the crossroads. Clear?

35:06.187 --> 35:08.898
Security out, go.
Move.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.740
Let's go.

35:53.025 --> 35:54.694
(gunshot)

35:54.777 --> 35:56.821
Jackson, hold on.

35:58.239 --> 35:59.365
Let's go.

35:59.448 --> 36:02.034
Jackson, wait.

36:03.578 --> 36:04.871
(screaming)

36:04.954 --> 36:07.373
(shouting in German)

36:04.954 --> 36:07.373
<i>Hande hoch!</i>

36:07.456 --> 36:09.250
Put it down!

36:09.333 --> 36:11.586
Put it down
and keep your hands out
where I can see them!

36:11.669 --> 36:13.671
(shouting in German)

36:13.754 --> 36:16.048
Martin:
Keep those Krauts quiet!

36:18.175 --> 36:20.553
Jackson.

36:20.636 --> 36:22.722
Vest, take care of him.

36:22.805 --> 36:25.850
Ramirez, watch Vest.
Let's go, Webster,
let's go.

36:25.933 --> 36:28.936
Split 'em up, come on.

36:25.933 --> 36:28.936
(Webster speaking German)

36:29.020 --> 36:30.605
Webster, check 'em
for weapons.

36:30.688 --> 36:32.481
Webster:
I'm gonna disarm them.
Cover me, McClung.

36:32.565 --> 36:35.276
Keep those men quiet!
McClung, cover him.

36:35.359 --> 36:38.654
Webster, take the charges,
prime it and hide it.

36:38.738 --> 36:42.241
Shut up, you two.
And pick him up!

36:42.325 --> 36:44.243
McClung, these two
are gonna carry

36:44.327 --> 36:46.245
the wounded Kraut.
Webster, tell 'em.

36:46.329 --> 36:49.373
Bring the wounded man.

36:46.329 --> 36:49.373
I said shut up.

36:49.457 --> 36:52.418
Ramirez, pick up Jackson.
We're moving out.

36:52.501 --> 36:55.171
Come on,
where are you going?
You, move!

36:55.254 --> 36:57.548
Everybody moves out
on my command!

36:57.632 --> 36:59.300
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

36:59.383 --> 37:02.011
Shut up, you!
Come on, we all
go together.

37:02.094 --> 37:04.305
(man speaking German)

37:04.388 --> 37:05.473
Let's go, move!
Move out!

37:05.556 --> 37:08.184
Let's go, move!
Move!

37:08.267 --> 37:09.644
(rapid gunfire)

37:09.727 --> 37:11.729
Webster, come on.

37:16.192 --> 37:20.071
Martin:
Powers, fall back!
We're moving out!

37:20.154 --> 37:23.240
McClung, keep those
prisoners' heads down
and let's keep moving!

37:23.324 --> 37:25.409
Wynn, fall back!

37:25.493 --> 37:28.037
We're moving out,
let's go!

37:30.206 --> 37:33.584
We're falling back!
Covering fire!

37:38.214 --> 37:42.134
Heffron, I want you
to fall back now!
Let's go!

37:45.096 --> 37:48.516
Move out!
Get back to the boat.
I'll cover. Go!

37:48.599 --> 37:50.559
Keep those men moving!

37:57.900 --> 38:00.111
Lieutenant,
take the whistle!

38:00.194 --> 38:01.404
Let's go!

38:01.487 --> 38:02.905
Go!

38:02.989 --> 38:05.825
Move it, Webster!
Let's get to the boats!

38:05.908 --> 38:08.786
Martin:
Let's go!
Stay low, keep moving!

38:08.869 --> 38:10.496
Keep moving the men!

38:10.579 --> 38:12.331
Fall back
to the boats now!

38:12.415 --> 38:14.333
Fall back!

38:15.960 --> 38:18.963
Jesus Christ, come on,
blow the goddamn whistle!

38:19.046 --> 38:20.756
(blowing whistle)

38:35.146 --> 38:38.107
Jones:
Everybody, get in the boats
right now!

38:38.190 --> 38:41.110
Martin:
To the boats, keep moving!
Come on, get in the boats!

38:41.193 --> 38:42.987
Come on, move!
Let's go, Shifty!

38:43.070 --> 38:45.031
I'm gonna shoot you,
you fucking kraut!

38:45.114 --> 38:47.199
Vest, shoot him,
and we'll have to
come back for more.

38:47.283 --> 38:48.659
You, in the boat, now!

38:48.743 --> 38:52.038
You get up,
you Kraut piece of shit!

38:54.957 --> 38:56.792
Jones:
In the boats!

38:56.876 --> 38:58.836
Quick, get in the boats,
come on!

38:58.919 --> 39:01.756
Martin:
Let's go! We're moving out!
Let's go!

39:01.839 --> 39:03.716
Let's get these boats
in the water!

39:03.799 --> 39:05.926
Start pulling!

39:14.810 --> 39:17.730
You're okay, Jackson.

39:22.068 --> 39:24.153
Keep pulling!

39:28.032 --> 39:31.202
Come on, keep going,
come on!

39:32.328 --> 39:35.706
Perconte, come on,
let's go.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.750
Where's the medic?

39:37.833 --> 39:40.377
(all shouting)

39:48.427 --> 39:51.180
Jones:
Everybody off the boats!
Let's go!

39:55.059 --> 39:57.186
Take cover!

39:57.269 --> 40:00.022
We got wounded,
come on!

40:01.732 --> 40:04.485
Popeye, get
the Krauts back there
and shake 'em down.

40:04.568 --> 40:06.529
Move, move, move!

40:06.612 --> 40:08.114
McClung, McClung!

40:08.197 --> 40:11.784
Get onto the company CP,
let 'em know what we got.

40:14.370 --> 40:16.914
Martin:
Shut up!
Web, Web.

40:16.997 --> 40:18.874
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.960
Move off.
Webster, stay with him.

40:21.043 --> 40:23.504
Hey, Shifty, watch Vest.

40:24.922 --> 40:26.590
Sir, I'm going
to get a medic.

40:26.674 --> 40:28.551
You got this?

40:26.674 --> 40:28.551
Yeah.

40:28.634 --> 40:31.053
(men continue shouting)

40:35.266 --> 40:37.226
Man:
Get his legs.
Get his legs.

40:37.309 --> 40:39.270
Jackson, listen to me.
You have to calm down,

40:39.353 --> 40:41.438
or we can't help you.
Settle down.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.484
Vest:
He's gonna fucking die.
He's gonna fucking die.

40:45.568 --> 40:47.486
Jackson, look at me.
Don't listen to him.
Look at me.

40:47.570 --> 40:50.489
You're gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be okay.

40:50.573 --> 40:53.200
(speaking German)

40:50.573 --> 40:53.200
I'm gonna kill you, Kraut!

40:53.284 --> 40:55.995
Keep still.
Be calm, buddy.
Everything's fine.

40:56.078 --> 40:58.414
Everything's fine.

40:56.078 --> 40:58.414
(whimpering)

40:58.497 --> 41:01.500
God damn it!

40:58.497 --> 41:01.500
Vest, no!

41:01.584 --> 41:04.628
(all shouting)

41:04.712 --> 41:07.381
You think you're
out of this war?
You ain't out of shit!

41:07.464 --> 41:09.383
What do you think
you're doing?

41:09.466 --> 41:12.720
We're not gonna
get more prisoners
because you killed one!

41:12.803 --> 41:15.556
Private, Private.
Listen to me. Private.

41:15.639 --> 41:18.100
He's gonna fucking die!

41:15.639 --> 41:18.100
Hey, sit down!

41:18.184 --> 41:20.060
Jackson, stay calm.
The medic is coming.

41:20.144 --> 41:22.605
They're on their way.
Where the fuck
is the medic?

41:22.688 --> 41:24.607
Doc is on his way.
Doc is on his way.

41:24.690 --> 41:27.151
You'll be okay.
You'll be okay.

41:27.234 --> 41:29.195
All right, Jackson,
you got the doc.

41:29.278 --> 41:31.697
You're okay, Jackson.
Take it easy.

41:31.780 --> 41:34.241
Shh, okay, okay.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.368
Okay.

41:36.452 --> 41:39.371
Light-- I need some light.
Give me some light.

41:39.455 --> 41:41.373
All right,
look at the flame.

41:41.457 --> 41:43.083
Jackson, look at
the flame.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.461
Okay, that's good.

41:47.588 --> 41:48.672
(whimpers)

41:48.756 --> 41:50.716
All right, let's get him
out of here.

41:50.799 --> 41:52.760
Guys, come on,
help the doc move him.

41:52.843 --> 41:55.221
(sobbing)
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

41:55.304 --> 41:58.265
Hey, hey, it's okay.
Hey, it's okay, Jackson.

41:58.349 --> 42:00.643
Let's get him out of here.

41:58.349 --> 42:00.643
I don't want to die.

42:00.726 --> 42:03.437
Take it easy.

42:00.726 --> 42:03.437
Please help me.

42:03.520 --> 42:05.731
It's okay.
Hey, it's okay.

42:05.814 --> 42:08.275
You're all right.

42:05.814 --> 42:08.275
Jackson!

42:08.359 --> 42:10.903
Oh, my god.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.903
Jackson, you're not
gonna die.

42:10.986 --> 42:13.572
You're not gonna die.
I need you to hang on!

42:15.699 --> 42:17.701
Jackson!

42:23.040 --> 42:26.835
(explosions and gunfire
continue)

42:56.740 --> 42:59.118
Webster:
<i>Eugene Jackson</i>
<i>was 20 years old.</i>

42:59.201 --> 43:02.788
<i>He'd lied about his age</i>
<i>when he joined the army</i>
<i>at 16.</i>

43:02.871 --> 43:05.249
<i>His family,</i>
<i>I'm sure,</i>

43:05.332 --> 43:07.209
<i>got a telegram</i>
<i>from the War Department,</i>

43:07.293 --> 43:09.837
<i>saying he died a hero</i>
<i>on an important mission</i>

43:09.920 --> 43:12.006
<i>that would help</i>
<i>win the war.</i>

43:12.089 --> 43:14.967
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>Eugene lost his life</i>
<i>on a stretcher</i>

43:15.050 --> 43:17.177
<i>in a dank basement</i>
<i>in Haguenau,</i>

43:17.261 --> 43:19.305
<i>crying out in agony,</i>
<i>while his friends</i>

43:19.388 --> 43:21.432
<i>looked on helplessly.</i>

43:21.515 --> 43:23.517
<i>He was just one more</i>
<i>casualty in a war</i>

43:23.600 --> 43:26.812
<i>that was supposed to be</i>
<i>all but over.</i>

43:28.397 --> 43:31.692
Winters:
Did they put that
in the report on the ADA?

43:31.775 --> 43:34.028
We're working on it.

43:34.111 --> 43:36.614
How long are you
gonna keep...

43:38.741 --> 43:41.952
(speaks German)

43:45.080 --> 43:47.833
Keep moving, go on.

43:47.916 --> 43:51.462
Get up on the truck.
Up, up.

43:52.463 --> 43:54.256
Status?

43:54.340 --> 43:56.425
Private Jackson took
a grenade fragment

43:56.508 --> 43:58.552
from the enemy OP.

43:58.635 --> 44:00.554
It was his own
grenade.

44:00.637 --> 44:03.640
He died
of his wounds, sir.

44:03.724 --> 44:05.684
Any others?

44:05.768 --> 44:07.770
No, sir.

44:11.106 --> 44:12.983
Well executed.

44:13.067 --> 44:14.985
It's not your fault.

44:15.069 --> 44:17.112
(truck engine starts)

44:17.196 --> 44:20.032
Talk to your men.

44:20.115 --> 44:21.950
Carry on.

44:20.115 --> 44:21.950
Thank you, sir.

44:33.629 --> 44:35.714
(distant gunshots)

44:48.018 --> 44:50.562
We heard you got
two prisoners.

44:52.272 --> 44:54.692
Good work.

44:54.775 --> 44:58.445
Jackson's dead.

44:58.529 --> 45:01.156
Yeah, we heard.

45:02.574 --> 45:06.662
Yeah, well, they want
another patrol tonight.

45:15.003 --> 45:17.297
(explosions)

45:17.381 --> 45:20.342
(man moaning loudly)

45:28.851 --> 45:30.477
What are you doing,
Cobb?

45:30.561 --> 45:33.480
You leave someone
on the bank?

45:36.024 --> 45:38.652
Yeah.
Yeah, we did.

45:38.735 --> 45:40.362
It's the third
prisoner

45:40.446 --> 45:43.323
that was too far gone
to bring back.

45:43.407 --> 45:46.201
Maybe we should put him
out of his misery.

45:46.285 --> 45:47.953
Fuck his misery.

45:48.036 --> 45:50.706
I can't listen to it
anymore.

46:07.097 --> 46:09.099
Who's got a light?

46:09.183 --> 46:11.351
Heffron:
Here, sir.

46:20.903 --> 46:24.740
Whatcha looking at,
Webster?

46:27.618 --> 46:31.997
Yeah, that's what
I thought, college boy.

46:34.416 --> 46:36.877
Are you drunk,
trooper?

46:36.960 --> 46:38.879
Leave me alone.

46:38.962 --> 46:41.006
Answer the question.

46:41.089 --> 46:43.759
Yes, sir,
I am drunk, sir.

46:45.427 --> 46:47.554
Drunk,

46:47.638 --> 46:49.348
sick and tired

46:49.431 --> 46:51.558
of fucking patrols,
taking orders.

46:51.642 --> 46:56.230
Hey, Cobb, shut up.
It's boring, okay?

46:56.313 --> 46:59.024
Taking his side,
Johnny?

47:02.569 --> 47:05.697
Yeah, I am.

47:30.764 --> 47:32.099
So he knows
we lost a man?

47:32.182 --> 47:33.809
Yeah, he knows.

47:33.892 --> 47:36.520
He also knows
you picked up two
prisoners who talked.

47:36.603 --> 47:38.480
About what?

47:38.564 --> 47:41.066
OB, supply trouble,

47:41.149 --> 47:42.901
Hitler's favorite color.

47:42.985 --> 47:45.195
I don't know, none of it
gets us across the river.

47:45.279 --> 47:47.155
What's the point?

47:48.365 --> 47:51.618
(sighs)
Honestly?

47:51.702 --> 47:54.413
Sink's been on the phone
all day, bragging it up.

47:54.496 --> 47:56.248
I think he's just
showing off now.

47:56.331 --> 47:59.084
I don't know, Dick.
I don't know what
to tell you.

47:59.167 --> 48:01.753
You gave him
a successful patrol.
Now he wants two.

48:01.837 --> 48:04.089
Successful.

48:04.172 --> 48:06.633
Sir, the men
are mustered.

48:06.717 --> 48:10.387
If you want me
to brief 'em, I'm gonna.

48:10.470 --> 48:14.308
It's the same roster
as last night.

48:14.391 --> 48:16.893
Well, mostly.

48:20.147 --> 48:22.983
'Evening, gents.

48:23.066 --> 48:25.235
At ease.

48:28.697 --> 48:30.449
Y'all did
a damn fine job

48:30.532 --> 48:33.744
on a tough
mission last night.
And I wish you good luck

48:33.827 --> 48:36.705
tonight, 'cause
I'll be expecting
more of the same.

48:36.788 --> 48:38.749
Have you briefed
the men?

48:38.832 --> 48:40.709
Just on our way, sir.

48:40.792 --> 48:43.086
All right.
Make damn sure

48:43.170 --> 48:45.339
you remind 'em
how proud I am
of what they did.

48:45.422 --> 48:47.549
Yes, sir.

48:52.429 --> 48:54.556
So I'll brief 'em now,
sir?

48:56.350 --> 48:58.727
No.

48:58.810 --> 49:01.188
No, I'll do it.

49:09.655 --> 49:11.948
Sarge, they're
on their way in.

49:12.032 --> 49:13.909
10-hut!

49:17.621 --> 49:19.498
Martin.

49:17.621 --> 49:19.498
Sir.

49:20.666 --> 49:22.501
At ease.

49:22.584 --> 49:24.961
This everybody, Grant?

49:22.584 --> 49:24.961
Sir.

49:28.965 --> 49:31.677
You men did
an excellent job
last night.

49:32.928 --> 49:35.889
I'm-- I'm proud.

49:35.972 --> 49:38.392
I'm proud.
I just saw Colonel Sink.
He's proud too.

49:38.475 --> 49:41.103
In fact, he's so proud,
he wants you to do
another patrol

49:41.186 --> 49:43.313
across the river
tonight.

49:47.192 --> 49:50.654
Any moment now,
the outpost we hit
last night

49:50.737 --> 49:52.614
will go up
in flames, Martin?

49:50.737 --> 49:52.614
Yes, sir.

49:52.698 --> 49:55.575
It means we'd have
to venture farther
into town this time.

49:55.659 --> 49:57.994
Captain Speirs,
you have the map, please?

49:55.659 --> 49:57.994
Yeah.

49:58.078 --> 50:00.122
Sergeant Grant.

50:03.333 --> 50:06.545
We have enemy movement
here and here,

50:06.628 --> 50:09.047
which means this is our
new house target here.

50:09.131 --> 50:11.216
We recovered
all the boats,

50:11.299 --> 50:13.969
so we'll be setting off
from the same place
we did last night.

50:14.052 --> 50:16.847
We're not changing
the plan any, sir?

50:18.849 --> 50:22.436
No, the plan
is the same.

50:22.519 --> 50:25.856
Uh, it will be
0200 hours

50:25.939 --> 50:28.275
instead of 0100.

50:28.358 --> 50:31.069
Is that clear?

50:28.358 --> 50:31.069
Yes, sir.

50:31.153 --> 50:33.780
Okay, good.

50:33.864 --> 50:35.866
Because, uh,

50:35.949 --> 50:38.660
I want you all
to get a full night's
sleep tonight.

50:40.579 --> 50:42.789
Which means
in the morning
you will report to me

50:42.873 --> 50:45.792
that you made it
across the river

50:45.876 --> 50:48.253
into German lines

50:48.336 --> 50:52.090
but were unable to secure
any live prisoners.

50:58.513 --> 51:01.892
Understand?

50:58.513 --> 51:01.892
Yes, sir.

51:06.188 --> 51:08.148
Good.

51:08.231 --> 51:10.108
Look sharp
for tomorrow.

51:10.192 --> 51:12.944
We're moving
off the line.

51:15.280 --> 51:18.283
Did I fucking
hear that right?

51:18.366 --> 51:20.327
A good man.

51:18.366 --> 51:20.327
(men laughing)

51:20.410 --> 51:24.080
Moving off the line.

51:20.410 --> 51:24.080
(chattering)

51:33.089 --> 51:35.300
Nixon:
It's a whole new way
to fight a war.

51:35.383 --> 51:38.887
Don't bother
writing this up.
I'll take care of it.

51:38.970 --> 51:40.597
I might actually enjoy it.

51:38.970 --> 51:40.597
Okay.

51:40.680 --> 51:43.350
Think you might be
onto something, Dick.

51:45.227 --> 51:47.187
Lieutenant Jones.

51:45.227 --> 51:47.187
Sir.

51:47.270 --> 51:49.314
Join us
at the company CP.

52:00.951 --> 52:03.411
1st Sergeant Lipton.

52:00.951 --> 52:03.411
Sir.

52:03.495 --> 52:06.164
Your honorable discharge
as an enlisted man.

52:06.248 --> 52:08.333
Just keep 'em
coming, Luz.

52:08.416 --> 52:10.418
Winters:
And battlefield commission
as a 2nd Lieutenant.

52:10.502 --> 52:12.754
Look what we
have here, boys.

52:10.502 --> 52:12.754
Hey, pal.

52:12.838 --> 52:15.131
Congratulations, Carwood.

52:12.838 --> 52:15.131
Thank you, sir.

52:15.215 --> 52:17.384
Nixon: Lip, congratulations.

52:15.215 --> 52:17.384
Thanks.

52:17.467 --> 52:19.761
Thank you, sir.

52:19.845 --> 52:21.471
Thank you.
Welcome back, sir.

52:21.555 --> 52:24.057
That's Harry to you.
Congratulations.

52:21.555 --> 52:24.057
Thanks, Harry.

52:24.140 --> 52:26.393
Nixon:
Harry, I didn't expect
to see you this soon.

52:26.476 --> 52:29.563
I figured you'd be
nursing that scratch
for another month or two.

52:29.646 --> 52:32.732
Did you miss me,
Lewis?

52:32.816 --> 52:34.526
Lieutenant Jones?

52:34.609 --> 52:36.403
The regiment
has seen fit

52:36.486 --> 52:38.488
to promote you
to 1st Lieutenant.

52:38.572 --> 52:42.450
They want you
on staff up there.

52:45.412 --> 52:47.706
Congratulations.
Good luck.

52:47.789 --> 52:48.999
Thank you, sir.

52:51.793 --> 52:53.795
Winters:
Dismissed.

52:53.879 --> 52:58.133
Looks like you lost
another platoon leader,
huh, Web?

52:58.216 --> 52:59.968
(chattering)

53:03.930 --> 53:06.224
Webster:
<i>So a second patrol</i>
<i>never happened.</i>

53:06.308 --> 53:08.977
<i>Word was, Captain Nixon</i>
<i>wrote up a bogus report</i>

53:09.060 --> 53:10.979
<i>and regiment</i>
<i>never got wise.</i>

53:11.062 --> 53:13.148
<i>As we pulled out</i>
<i>of Haguenau,</i>

53:13.231 --> 53:16.109
<i>many of us in Easy Company</i>
<i>felt that a corner</i>
<i>had been turned</i>

53:16.192 --> 53:19.654
<i>and we all might</i>
<i>make it home alive.</i>

53:19.738 --> 53:21.239
Nixon:
So we'll know more

53:21.323 --> 53:23.325
as soon as we get
closer to the line.

53:23.408 --> 53:25.952
Oh, before I forget,

53:26.036 --> 53:28.747
Colonel Sink's
a bit unhappy

53:28.830 --> 53:30.498
with the appearance
of your uniform.

53:30.582 --> 53:33.960
He says it's not
befitting to your rank.

53:39.382 --> 53:41.551
Oak leaves.

53:42.844 --> 53:46.097
Congratulations, Major.

53:48.224 --> 53:51.436
Gentlemen, we're ready.

53:59.194 --> 54:01.696
I'll drive.

54:01.780 --> 54:05.116
Jones: Sergeant Malarkey.

54:01.780 --> 54:05.116
Good luck, sir.

54:05.200 --> 54:07.452
Appreciate it.

54:07.535 --> 54:09.120
Sergeant Martin.

54:09.204 --> 54:10.455
Lieutenant.

54:10.538 --> 54:12.332
Good work.

54:10.538 --> 54:12.332
Thank you, sir.

54:12.415 --> 54:14.626
Good to have you along.

54:12.415 --> 54:14.626
Good luck, men.

54:39.359 --> 54:40.986
Here.

54:55.542 --> 54:57.711
Webster:
<i>I wondered</i>
<i>if people back home</i>

54:57.794 --> 55:01.047
<i>would ever know</i>
<i>what it cost the soldiers</i>
<i>to win this war.</i>

55:01.131 --> 55:04.926
<i>In America, things were</i>
<i>already beginning to look</i>
<i>like peacetime.</i>

55:05.010 --> 55:07.053
<i>The standard of living</i>
<i>was on the rise.</i>

55:07.137 --> 55:09.222
<i>Race tracks</i>
<i>and nightclubs</i>
<i>were booming.</i>

55:09.305 --> 55:11.391
<i>You couldn't</i>
<i>get a hotel room</i>
<i>in Miami Beach,</i>

55:11.474 --> 55:13.560
<i>it was so crowded.</i>

55:15.311 --> 55:17.188
<i>How could anyone</i>
<i>ever know</i>

55:17.272 --> 55:19.190
<i>of the price</i>
<i>paid by soldiers</i>

55:19.274 --> 55:21.192
<i>in terror, agony</i>
<i>and bloodshed</i>

55:21.276 --> 55:23.486
<i>if they'd never been</i>
<i>to places like Normandy,</i>

55:23.570 --> 55:25.989
<i>Bastogne or Haguenau?</i>

55:53.141 --> 55:55.602
