00:08.376 --> 00:11.745
Love's been around

00:11.779 --> 00:16.149
Since time began

00:16.184 --> 00:22.523
Yet I never found
The time

00:22.556 --> 00:25.559
Now since we've met

00:25.593 --> 00:29.730
I'm a different man

00:29.763 --> 00:32.100
The time I lost

00:32.133 --> 00:34.768
I found in you

00:34.802 --> 00:37.905
I found in you

00:37.938 --> 00:41.642
In time

01:03.797 --> 01:06.200
Oh, shit.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.719
Hey, you little fuck!

02:00.688 --> 02:03.090
Mort! You owe me, Mort!

02:03.123 --> 02:04.792
What do you think
you're doing, Joey?

02:06.260 --> 02:07.461
Mort! Mort!

02:08.795 --> 02:10.898
I did the job.
You're dead, Joey!

02:10.931 --> 02:12.099
I want my money.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.667
I'm getting out of
this fucking town

02:13.701 --> 02:14.935
and I gotta collect.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.472
Oh, damn!

02:20.741 --> 02:22.576
I'll kill you!
Come on,

02:22.610 --> 02:24.445
Mort, be reasonable.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.879
This is business.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.350
Nice belt buckle.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.889
You ain't gettin' shit.
Drop my TV.

02:39.026 --> 02:40.228
You dick!

02:48.369 --> 02:51.038
You motherfucker.
Come on, you little ass.

02:51.071 --> 02:53.807
Fuck with me, huh?
You fuckin' little asshole,

02:53.841 --> 02:55.576
dickhead, cocksucker!

02:55.609 --> 02:57.678
You fuckin' come on!
Come fuck with me!

02:57.711 --> 02:59.580
I'll get your ass, you jerk!

02:59.613 --> 03:01.715
You fuckhead,
motherfucker!

03:01.749 --> 03:03.451
Fuck all of you
and your family!

03:03.484 --> 03:05.519
Come on, you cocksucker,

03:05.553 --> 03:08.856
slime-bucket, shit-face,
dirt ball!

03:08.889 --> 03:10.891
Come on, you scum-sucker,

03:10.924 --> 03:12.593
you fuckin' weemie!

03:12.626 --> 03:15.829
Come on, you asshole!

03:54.868 --> 03:57.405
MONA:
This isn't such
a bad place to die,

03:57.438 --> 03:59.707
is it, Chucky?

03:59.740 --> 04:02.943
I tattooed your name
on my ass.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.346
How was I supposed to know
you were a Nazi?

04:08.782 --> 04:10.951
Oh, Julian,

04:10.984 --> 04:15.022
I really wanted it to work.
I did.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.224
Too bad you really
wanted a boyfriend.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.265
Dear Abdul,

04:25.299 --> 04:28.769
you were kind and gentle,

04:28.802 --> 04:31.472
and schizophrenic.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.841
A shoe salesman,

04:33.874 --> 04:35.376
gang member,

04:35.409 --> 04:39.480
TV actor, pornographer.

04:44.184 --> 04:47.888
MONA:
And finally, you, Lance.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.324
You were such a good...

04:53.293 --> 04:55.729
...lay.

05:43.276 --> 05:44.344
Are we dead?

05:44.378 --> 05:46.447
I don't think so.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.053
Can--
Could you help me, please?

05:54.354 --> 05:56.189
Actually, I was
trying to kill myself.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.693
Could you put it off?

06:21.281 --> 06:22.416
Oh, what's your name?

06:23.884 --> 06:24.918
Mona.

06:24.952 --> 06:27.120
Mona. That's a--
A beautiful name.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.221
Mona Lisa.

06:28.255 --> 06:30.424
So, what's your name?

06:31.191 --> 06:33.060
Joey Turks.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.462
Joey Turks?

06:36.764 --> 06:38.398
So where do you live?

06:38.432 --> 06:41.101
I-- I bounce around.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.437
You don't have
a home?

06:43.471 --> 06:44.738
I haven't settled yet.

06:44.772 --> 06:47.240
How long have you
been in town?

06:48.175 --> 06:49.543
Two or three years.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.314
Why were you trying
to kill yourself?

06:54.982 --> 06:56.517
Because I'm fucked up.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.220
Well, so am I.
So is everybody.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.321
So what?

07:05.526 --> 07:07.461
I think I'm gonna
go to bed now.

07:08.696 --> 07:10.964
You can stay on the couch
if you want.

07:13.501 --> 07:14.702
Mona.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.269
What?

07:16.303 --> 07:18.138
Thank you.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.773
For what?

07:19.807 --> 07:21.709
Saving my life.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.811
You're welcome.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.515
Do you dance?

08:38.652 --> 08:41.054
Do you dance?

08:41.087 --> 08:42.623
Do I--?

08:42.655 --> 08:46.059
I lost two gallons of blood
and you're asking me to dance?

08:47.327 --> 08:50.898
What time--? Ow.
What time is it?

08:50.931 --> 08:52.199
I wanna dance.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.266
Don't wanna dance.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.269
Yes. Come on.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.738
Come on.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.309
Sure you can.

09:02.342 --> 09:03.476
Come on.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.846
Oh, we're dancing.

09:05.879 --> 09:06.947
We're dancing.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.084
That's okay.
That's okay.

09:11.118 --> 09:12.119
Okay.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.656
Oh, that's good.

09:16.724 --> 09:17.825
Yeah.

09:23.797 --> 09:26.233
Why haven't you
come into my room?

09:28.568 --> 09:29.970
Because I'm an invalid.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.777
Uh, you have a very nice
apartment.

09:36.810 --> 09:40.180
Is-- Is that a
Norton Rockwell on the wall?

09:43.483 --> 09:45.285
Uh...

09:48.822 --> 09:51.692
I really don't know
how to dance.

09:51.725 --> 09:54.461
MONA:
You saved my life today.

09:54.494 --> 09:57.397
And,

09:57.430 --> 10:01.001
I don't know whether
to thank you,

10:01.034 --> 10:03.904
or to hate you.

10:03.937 --> 10:07.908
Or if I didn't save
your life,

10:07.941 --> 10:09.743
you wouldn't have
saved mine

10:09.777 --> 10:11.511
and I would have
bled to death.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.480
And blood makes me
nauseous.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.685
MORT:
Who is it? Who are you?

10:51.719 --> 10:54.021
You're fucking with me,
you're fucking with Mort!

10:55.555 --> 10:58.291
I'll blow your balls off,
you fuck with me!

10:58.325 --> 11:01.228
I'll fuck with you!

11:01.261 --> 11:03.396
Fuck you and your mother,
you asshole!

11:03.430 --> 11:05.766
You're dead!

11:06.900 --> 11:08.435
You pussy, come and get me!

11:08.468 --> 11:11.138
Come and get me, you fucker!

11:25.652 --> 11:28.822
Hey, Hanky, the bad guys
winning again, huh?

11:28.856 --> 11:31.591
Yeah, I guess this is
the only place you can win

11:31.624 --> 11:33.560
when you reach the
golden years, huh, old man?

11:33.593 --> 11:35.362
Hey, how's the case
goin', Hank?

11:35.395 --> 11:37.430
Three dead scumbags,
no clues.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.033
Hey, you know, maybe you
ought to file it inactive

11:40.067 --> 11:41.534
with all
your other cases.

11:41.568 --> 11:44.872
Yeah, the legendary Hank Dick
and his famous intuition.

11:53.747 --> 11:57.017
Now, you wouldn't wanna
blow your pension

11:57.050 --> 11:58.585
so close to
your retirement,

11:58.618 --> 12:00.520
would you, pops?

12:27.781 --> 12:29.783
Got us some doughnuts
and some coffee.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.093
You all right?

12:42.262 --> 12:44.231
I want you to go.

12:51.371 --> 12:52.873
You heard what I said.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.408
About what?

12:55.442 --> 12:57.477
Our date is over.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.081
Okay.

13:01.114 --> 13:04.217
Right now?

13:04.251 --> 13:06.586
Let's go get some breakfast.
Some eggs will do you good.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.588
Get out!

13:11.158 --> 13:12.292
Seen my shirt?

13:14.127 --> 13:15.863
This is good.
This is...

13:15.896 --> 13:17.097
...very nice.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.531
I gotta get
out of this town.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.086
Oh, shit.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.056
Joey?

13:52.332 --> 13:54.801
I don't know, Mona. You're
kind of hard to figure out.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.304
Well, actually,
I'm an open book.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.006
You like me, right?

13:59.039 --> 14:01.574
Yeah, I like you.
It's just that...

14:01.608 --> 14:03.743
Well, I mean, I don't think
I should get real close

14:03.776 --> 14:04.945
to anybody right now.

14:04.978 --> 14:07.447
I've had my share
of problems with men,

14:07.480 --> 14:09.182
and the last one made
the Marquis de Sade

14:09.216 --> 14:10.383
look like Pat Boone.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.252
Marquis who?

14:12.285 --> 14:14.221
Forget it.

14:14.254 --> 14:17.390
Well, I...

14:17.424 --> 14:19.292
Maybe we can go
on a date sometime.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.730
Why don't you move in?

14:44.317 --> 14:45.652
Oh, man.

14:47.154 --> 14:48.255
Hi, Joey.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.589
So where's my bag?

14:49.622 --> 14:50.723
Three bucks, partner.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.192
You know there's
a 24-hour limit.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.593
Come on, Thelma.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.228
How are you?

14:55.262 --> 14:56.396
Spot me this time.

14:56.429 --> 14:57.830
This time
is the fourth time.

14:57.864 --> 15:00.100
No money, no bag.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.502
You're going
to Phoenix too?

15:02.535 --> 15:04.071
Oh, good.

15:04.104 --> 15:07.007
My daughter has
a rock garden there.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.109
And there's one
big rock in the middle.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.978
Oh, it's beautiful.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.446
I lay down near it
once a day,

15:13.480 --> 15:15.315
and it rejuvenates me.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.649
Do you believe in rocks?

15:16.683 --> 15:18.718
Yeah, sure. I like rocks.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.053
Oh.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.022
Some people believe in
those mineral baths.

15:22.055 --> 15:23.656
And mud.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.026
I think the water's
polluted.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.028
You can't pollute a rock,

15:28.061 --> 15:29.062
can you?

15:30.297 --> 15:31.398
Can you?

15:31.431 --> 15:32.565
No.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.335
Rocks are like stars.

15:35.368 --> 15:38.038
They have a special aura,

15:38.071 --> 15:39.106
and temperature

15:39.139 --> 15:40.440
and personality.

15:40.473 --> 15:44.311
My favorite is sandstone.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.778
It's so compassionate,

15:45.812 --> 15:47.347
and sensuous.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.949
You have a wonderful trip.

15:49.983 --> 15:52.219
Aren't you going to Phoenix?

15:52.252 --> 15:54.687
Uh, no, I can't go there.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.494
Thanks.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.122
Gotcha.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.457
Hello, Joseph.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.624
Detective Dick.

16:31.658 --> 16:32.925
Let's drop
the formalities, kid.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.161
Call me Hank.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.362
Okay, Hank.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.464
You weren't thinking about
borrowing this car

16:37.497 --> 16:40.733
with the keys in the ignition
now, were you, Joey?

16:40.767 --> 16:42.135
No.
Naw, naw.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.137
This is my cousin's car.
And he doesn't--

16:44.171 --> 16:46.273
Grifting small change
from old ladies.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.508
That'll buy you three months
in the tank.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.843
She's my aunt and she--

16:50.877 --> 16:52.011
She's a very nice lady.

16:52.045 --> 16:55.315
She had to give me
a couple of bucks.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.351
Let's go for a drive,
stupid!

17:01.854 --> 17:03.590
I'm clean, Hank.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.358
Hank, I'm clean
as a whistle.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.359
I'm a new man, Hank.

17:17.369 --> 17:20.573
I've got my eye
on you, son.

17:26.445 --> 17:29.849
HANK:
Your fingerprints
are all over the place, pal.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.050
It's a mess.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.786
You're scum, Joey.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.888
He is scum.

17:35.922 --> 17:38.057
I'm not gonna tell
the coroner about this.

17:38.091 --> 17:41.728
He can bleed and rot
until I bust this case.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.730
And as for you,

17:43.763 --> 17:46.199
you can rot in the hole.
Let's go.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.900
He was alive
when I left here!

17:47.934 --> 17:49.969
Come on, slammer time!

17:50.002 --> 17:52.572
He owed me 400 bucks,
the asshole!

17:52.605 --> 17:54.974
You're the asshole.
Four hundred bucks for what?

17:55.007 --> 17:56.176
Talk!
Ow!

17:56.209 --> 17:58.010
Aargh!
Ow!

17:58.044 --> 17:59.112
Why did he owe you?

17:59.146 --> 18:00.447
I ran something.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.681
For who?

18:01.714 --> 18:02.849
For Mort.

18:02.882 --> 18:03.950
From who?

18:03.983 --> 18:05.918
I don't know. Ow!

18:05.952 --> 18:08.188
Spuntz!
I did it for Spuntz!

18:08.221 --> 18:10.290
Spuntz?

18:10.323 --> 18:12.592
H. Spuntz?

18:12.625 --> 18:14.060
What did you deliver?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.562
A big box.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.264
A big box?
You idiot,

18:17.297 --> 18:19.132
you don't even know
what you were handling.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.300
Where did you
meet Spuntz?

18:20.333 --> 18:21.368
Meet?

18:21.401 --> 18:23.136
You know no one
meets Spuntz, Hank.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.437
I made a blind pickup.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.609
Come on, upsy-daisy.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.247
You didn't kill anybody.

18:36.349 --> 18:39.186
I don't wanna go to jail.

18:39.219 --> 18:42.522
I want Spuntz.

18:42.555 --> 18:47.427
I want him so bad
I can taste his blood.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.229
I dream about him.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.331
He ruins my appetite.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.732
I think about him
when I shit.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.537
I even have
a picture of him.

18:57.570 --> 19:00.173
Twenty years
I've been after him.

19:00.207 --> 19:02.475
And I can smell him now.

19:02.509 --> 19:06.813
How can such a small-time
buffoon cause so much trouble?

19:08.848 --> 19:10.350
You're gonna help me, right?

19:10.383 --> 19:12.852
Yeah. How?

19:12.885 --> 19:18.124
My intuition tells me that
he's gonna come after you,

19:18.157 --> 19:22.629
and you're gonna
lead me to that pig.

19:22.662 --> 19:27.334
You're gonna tell me
everything that happened

19:27.367 --> 19:29.836
or your balls
are going to fry.

19:29.869 --> 19:33.573
Don't fuck with me, boy,

19:33.606 --> 19:36.075
because I'll send you
down on murder one.

19:36.108 --> 19:38.211
Don't, because I will.

19:38.245 --> 19:39.712
I'll-- I'll promise--

19:39.746 --> 19:41.414
I'll help you,
Hank, I swear.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.250
I swear.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.467
Coming.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.204
Hey, baby. Miss me?

20:05.238 --> 20:07.274
Lance, what are you
doing here?

20:07.307 --> 20:10.743
I said I didn't wanna
see you anymore.

20:10.777 --> 20:13.280
Aw, come on.
You didn't mean that.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.581
Fuck off.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.349
Wait. Wait a second.

20:18.117 --> 20:19.719
I thought you might be
needing--

20:19.752 --> 20:21.854
Stop! It's over,
we're finished!

20:21.888 --> 20:23.256
What do you mean
we're finished?

20:23.290 --> 20:25.392
Hey, who the fuck do you--
Get out! Oh!

20:28.795 --> 20:30.096
What?

20:30.129 --> 20:32.765
Is that a new shade
of lipstick you're wearing?

20:32.799 --> 20:35.201
You're a dick!

20:35.234 --> 20:36.903
LANCE:
Ow!

20:42.609 --> 20:44.110
Sorry.
Jesus Christ, man!

20:44.143 --> 20:47.146
Watch where you're going!
I ought to kick your ass!

20:47.179 --> 20:49.316
Well, go ahead.

20:52.184 --> 20:53.353
Asshole.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.790
Ow! Fuck!

21:00.527 --> 21:01.761
Dickhead.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.296
I told you that is it!

21:06.198 --> 21:07.767
Am I in or out?

21:07.800 --> 21:09.001
Come in. I'm sorry.

21:09.035 --> 21:12.204
There was just some idiot
banging on my door.

21:12.238 --> 21:14.507
A lot of idiots
in this neighborhood.

21:14.541 --> 21:17.844
Is that it?

21:17.877 --> 21:19.346
Yeah, that's it.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.847
You can put it
in the closet.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.018
Think it'll fit?

21:26.052 --> 21:27.554
I made you dinner.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.431
What are we having?

21:39.632 --> 21:41.468
Chicken and noodles.

21:47.106 --> 21:49.275
They're ramen noodles.

22:02.254 --> 22:03.356
Mm.

22:10.697 --> 22:12.432
They're good.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.374
So do you, um, chew,

22:21.408 --> 22:23.476
or do you just shovel?

22:26.045 --> 22:27.514
Sorry.

22:27.547 --> 22:30.316
I eat when I'm nervous.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.018
Well, what are you
nervous about?

22:32.051 --> 22:34.554
I was almost
a murder suspect today.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.423
A murderer?

22:36.456 --> 22:37.824
It figures.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.393
I'm not.

22:40.427 --> 22:42.361
Do I look like a murderer?

22:46.966 --> 22:49.068
I'm a nice guy, right?

22:52.939 --> 22:54.507
Uh-huh.

22:58.310 --> 22:59.879
Mm.

23:03.416 --> 23:04.851
Yeah, you're a nice guy.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.860
You're a very nice guy.

23:20.032 --> 23:23.335
So, what do you do for work?

23:24.604 --> 23:26.172
Um...

23:27.640 --> 23:31.944
I'm in a career
transition at the moment.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.446
You got a job?

23:34.981 --> 23:36.449
Envelopes.

23:36.483 --> 23:38.585
I stuff 'em,

23:38.618 --> 23:40.453
I lick 'em,

23:40.487 --> 23:42.388
and I send 'em.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.692
Sounds interesting.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.296
I wanna take you
somewhere.

23:50.329 --> 23:51.631
Okay?

23:55.668 --> 23:57.036
That'll be great.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.307
Can I finish my noodles?

24:10.116 --> 24:12.118
One girl in five maybe

24:12.151 --> 24:15.054
Maybe look away

24:15.087 --> 24:20.292
One girl in 10
Maybe you give the time of day

24:20.326 --> 24:25.331
One girl in 15
And you're cultured and polite

24:25.364 --> 24:30.436
Oh, please, and thank you
Let me stay another night

24:30.469 --> 24:33.773
But one girl in a million

24:33.806 --> 24:36.442
Will be your confidante

24:36.475 --> 24:40.680
Your paramour
Your partner in crime

24:40.713 --> 24:44.617
One girl in a million

24:44.651 --> 24:47.486
Only one girl in a million

24:47.520 --> 24:50.389
Is a friend for life

24:55.227 --> 24:57.897
Two girls make a party

24:57.930 --> 25:00.199
Three girls make a war

25:00.232 --> 25:02.902
Four girls make an opera

25:02.935 --> 25:05.304
And five just make you sore

25:05.337 --> 25:07.640
Each one is so different

25:07.674 --> 25:10.242
Yet you remain the same

25:10.276 --> 25:12.545
A lonely man with memories

25:12.579 --> 25:15.081
Who's not too good
With names

25:20.452 --> 25:23.455
BACKING SINGERS:
Who will stand beside you?
Stand beside you

25:23.489 --> 25:26.626
When your money's
All run out?

25:30.029 --> 25:32.498
And understands
What moonlight

25:32.531 --> 25:36.502
And a long walk
Off to nowhere's all about

25:40.673 --> 25:45.377
One girl in 50
You might give a half a year

25:45.411 --> 25:50.249
One girl in 60
Throws you out upon your ear

25:50.282 --> 25:52.685
Eighty had you crying

25:52.719 --> 25:54.821
Ninety baked you cakes

25:54.854 --> 25:57.123
One hundred broke the bottle

25:57.156 --> 26:00.026
Broke your head
And broke the leg

26:02.294 --> 26:05.665
But one girl in a million

26:05.698 --> 26:07.834
Will be your confidante

26:07.867 --> 26:12.038
Your paramour
Your partner in crime

26:12.071 --> 26:15.775
One girl in a million

26:15.808 --> 26:18.344
Only one girl in a million

26:18.377 --> 26:21.413
Is a friend for life

26:35.194 --> 26:38.998
One girl in a million

26:39.031 --> 26:42.268
Only one girl in a million

26:42.301 --> 26:48.808
Is your friend for life

27:09.561 --> 27:11.130
So, what did you think?

27:11.163 --> 27:12.431
It was beautiful.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.532
Really?

27:13.565 --> 27:15.668
That was very--
That was very beautiful.

27:17.336 --> 27:18.437
LANCE:
Hey, baby.

27:19.571 --> 27:20.907
You paid for it,

27:20.940 --> 27:22.441
now you're gonna get it.

27:22.474 --> 27:26.245
And I'm just the asshole
you love gettin' it from.

27:26.278 --> 27:27.747
One, two, three, four!

27:33.786 --> 27:38.557
Searching for a new way
You're looking

27:38.590 --> 27:41.861
For a way out of
This mess

27:41.894 --> 27:44.030
You've let build up
Around you

27:47.433 --> 27:50.402
Believe what you see

27:50.436 --> 27:51.971
Believe what you hear

27:52.004 --> 27:54.673
You wanna get some air?

27:54.707 --> 27:55.742
You go ahead.

27:55.775 --> 27:59.011
I got-- I got somebody
I have to talk to.

27:59.045 --> 28:03.315
It's time to take charge of
Your own life

28:03.349 --> 28:06.719
And start making decisions

28:06.753 --> 28:09.188
Stop relying on others

28:18.931 --> 28:19.999
Hip suit.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.634
Thanks.

28:24.603 --> 28:25.671
It dazzles.

28:31.677 --> 28:33.780
It's boring,
isn't it?

28:33.813 --> 28:34.847
What's that?

28:34.881 --> 28:36.883
The music.

28:36.916 --> 28:38.317
It's just loud.

28:39.886 --> 28:43.823
Yes, that's it.

28:43.856 --> 28:46.793
It's just loud.

28:46.826 --> 28:50.496
Loud, loud, loud, loud!

28:50.529 --> 28:51.864
Beautiful, man.

28:51.898 --> 28:53.132
Are you a poet?

28:53.165 --> 28:55.501
No.

29:06.545 --> 29:08.848
What do you
listen to?

29:08.881 --> 29:10.883
I like a voice.
I like, you know, a song.

29:10.917 --> 29:13.385
Yeah, yeah.

29:13.419 --> 29:14.987
You know, like Nat,
Vic, Tony.

29:15.021 --> 29:16.823
Of course, I love Frank.

29:17.957 --> 29:19.491
You--

29:19.525 --> 29:21.460
You are the voice of hip.

29:23.595 --> 29:26.732
Strangers in the--

29:26.765 --> 29:27.934
No, wait a minute.

29:27.967 --> 29:30.669
Wait.
Strangers in the--

29:30.702 --> 29:32.805
Strange--

29:32.839 --> 29:35.574
Oh, man, you must think
I'm such a hose.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.676
Strangers in the--

29:40.146 --> 29:42.148
In you go. Up!

29:42.181 --> 29:43.850
Frank who?

29:48.120 --> 29:51.190
Believe what you see

29:51.223 --> 29:52.925
Believe what you hear

29:52.959 --> 29:54.961
Body heat

29:54.994 --> 29:56.628
Generate

29:56.662 --> 29:58.730
Body heat

29:58.764 --> 30:00.599
Stimulate

30:04.370 --> 30:06.272
Hallucinate

30:06.305 --> 30:08.040
Radiate

30:08.074 --> 30:10.877
Adrenalin
Adrenalin

30:20.252 --> 30:22.154
MAN:
Mr. Turks.

30:22.188 --> 30:25.291
These are not the most
pleasant surroundings

30:25.324 --> 30:27.493
to meet in
for the first time.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.561
H. Spuntz?

30:55.187 --> 30:59.525
Joey, meet Bart Daniels.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.227
Pleased to meet you,
Joey.

31:04.030 --> 31:06.832
I'm not going to waste time.

31:09.135 --> 31:12.138
What were you doing here?

31:12.171 --> 31:14.806
Why did you kill Mort?

31:14.840 --> 31:16.642
And where's my product?

31:16.675 --> 31:18.444
I didn't kill Mort.

31:19.979 --> 31:23.715
Joseph,

31:23.749 --> 31:25.151
where's my product?

31:25.184 --> 31:27.119
What product?

31:27.153 --> 31:28.988
I don't--
I don't-- Aah!

31:36.963 --> 31:37.997
That's enough.

31:38.030 --> 31:39.165
Let's waste him!

31:40.599 --> 31:42.901
You ingrate!
He's all we've got!

31:42.935 --> 31:44.803
Fuck you, fatty.

31:44.836 --> 31:46.238
I'll put you back
on the streets!

32:03.255 --> 32:05.257
Joey, that gun.

32:06.425 --> 32:08.760
That's pathetic.

32:10.862 --> 32:11.897
Uh...

32:11.930 --> 32:13.599
Now, Bart, everyone knows
Joey Turks

32:13.632 --> 32:16.302
never carries
a loaded gun.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.208
Calm yourself, lad.

32:22.241 --> 32:23.842
Pull up a chair, Bart.

32:38.890 --> 32:40.426
Joey,

32:40.459 --> 32:43.362
do you know what you
ran for me that day?

32:44.963 --> 32:49.601
Lab name: LBD.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.570
Street name:

32:51.603 --> 32:54.073
libido.

32:54.106 --> 32:56.675
Some of my colleagues
make this:

32:58.544 --> 33:00.846
Into this:

33:03.082 --> 33:06.385
This new pill

33:06.418 --> 33:10.322
fills that one void that
causes so much desperation

33:10.356 --> 33:13.459
in so many people.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.694
Love,

33:15.727 --> 33:18.030
physical love.

33:20.099 --> 33:21.733
Fucking.

33:23.602 --> 33:26.705
It's what everybody wants.

33:26.738 --> 33:28.640
Isn't fucking the answer?

33:30.342 --> 33:33.679
Libido makes you feel

33:33.712 --> 33:37.216
warm all over.

33:37.249 --> 33:40.519
It makes you wanna
reach out and

33:40.552 --> 33:43.489
touch someone.

33:43.522 --> 33:46.092
It makes you wanna fuck.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.594
Over and over.

33:50.829 --> 33:52.931
And the sickness
you feel the next day

33:52.964 --> 33:55.567
makes you want more.

33:55.601 --> 33:58.604
A few tastes
and you're addicted.

33:58.637 --> 34:01.173
Bang-o!

34:01.207 --> 34:04.810
You're addicted to something
you already want to do.

34:04.843 --> 34:08.780
Heh. It's beautiful.

34:08.813 --> 34:11.717
I bring people together.

34:25.731 --> 34:29.168
I have most of my earnings

34:29.201 --> 34:31.469
invested in this product.

34:34.106 --> 34:37.409
It's the only batch
on the entire planet.

34:40.011 --> 34:41.813
I procured them.

34:43.482 --> 34:44.683
I want them back!

34:46.485 --> 34:48.187
Where are they?

34:48.219 --> 34:51.290
I didn't steal 'em.

34:51.322 --> 34:53.391
BART:
Howard,

34:53.425 --> 34:55.594
can I use one of my
personalized bullets?

35:14.313 --> 35:16.215
I want my drugs.

35:22.087 --> 35:23.555
I want my drugs!

35:26.392 --> 35:28.227
I want my drugs!

35:30.596 --> 35:32.164
I want them!

35:32.198 --> 35:33.399
I want them!

35:33.432 --> 35:34.566
I want them!

35:34.600 --> 35:37.469
I'll help you!
I'll--

35:38.837 --> 35:42.574
I-- I-- I know
where to find 'em.

35:46.778 --> 35:49.615
Bart,

35:49.648 --> 35:52.017
take him.

35:52.050 --> 35:53.685
Take him.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.393
Show me
where to go, Joey.

36:19.545 --> 36:21.112
Adrenalin

36:27.118 --> 36:28.320
Body heat

36:28.354 --> 36:29.621
Which way?
Right.

36:33.058 --> 36:34.260
Right again.

36:34.293 --> 36:36.194
What?
Right again.

36:38.129 --> 36:39.831
Left, right.

36:39.865 --> 36:42.100
Are you sure?
Shit. Left.

36:42.133 --> 36:44.135
I'm sorry. Left.

36:44.169 --> 36:46.505
Adrenalin
Adrenalin, adrenalin

36:46.538 --> 36:47.806
Are you dickin'
with me, Joey?

36:47.839 --> 36:49.107
No, I don't wanna--

36:49.140 --> 36:51.677
Are you dickin' with me?
I wouldn't--

36:51.710 --> 36:55.013
Which way do we go?
Left. Left.

36:55.046 --> 36:56.214
That way?

36:56.248 --> 36:57.849
Jesus, left.

37:03.855 --> 37:06.292
This is definitely
a left.

37:07.926 --> 37:09.861
Are you sure about that?
Hm?

37:09.895 --> 37:10.929
Positive.

37:13.599 --> 37:16.535
This up here.

37:16.568 --> 37:17.803
This is where I get off!

37:23.642 --> 37:26.111
Hey. Hey, where you going?
Come here...

37:26.144 --> 37:28.814
Come back. Come here.

37:45.196 --> 37:47.132
You must be real
fucking losers

37:47.165 --> 37:48.934
to fucking listen
to this shit!

37:57.676 --> 37:59.945
Oh, man, no beer.

38:03.715 --> 38:06.452
Hey, baby, what are
you doin' here?

38:09.688 --> 38:12.891
Lance, I don't wanna make
a big thing out of this.

38:12.924 --> 38:14.526
I just came down here
to tell you...

38:16.762 --> 38:19.598
...that I don't wanna
see you anymore.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.333
I don't wanna
hear from you.

38:21.367 --> 38:22.934
I don't wanna
fuck you anymore.

38:22.968 --> 38:25.003
And I don't want you
to come to the apartment.

38:25.036 --> 38:27.639
You know,
you should've called me,

38:27.673 --> 38:29.675
because we could've had
a little duet action.

38:29.708 --> 38:32.077
You're such an asshole.

38:32.110 --> 38:33.278
You repulse me.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.747
Really? It's kind of
a happy coincidence

38:35.781 --> 38:37.816
because that's when
you fuck the best.

38:37.849 --> 38:39.751
You dick!
Ow! Hey!

38:39.785 --> 38:41.353
Hey, wait!
Maybe I was a little hasty.

38:41.387 --> 38:43.088
All right, look,

38:43.121 --> 38:45.290
what I really
wanted tell you was,

38:45.323 --> 38:48.093
do you remember
that rash you gave me?

38:48.126 --> 38:49.595
Well,
it's all cleared up,

38:49.628 --> 38:51.663
and I'd suggest a talc
for you, if you want.

38:51.697 --> 38:53.064
You just--

38:53.098 --> 38:54.232
Come on!

38:54.265 --> 38:56.702
Get off of me!
You know you want it.

38:56.735 --> 39:00.338
Hey, man. How's it going?

39:00.372 --> 39:02.307
Hey, what do you think
of the velvet frog?

39:02.340 --> 39:03.809
You know, Mel?
Mel TormÃ©?

39:05.110 --> 39:06.244
Yeah.

39:06.277 --> 39:07.746
Get off of me!
Come on.

39:07.779 --> 39:09.014
Get off of me!

39:09.047 --> 39:10.248
What the hell's going on?

39:10.281 --> 39:11.550
Nice shoes there,
Camper Bob.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.652
The lady and I are trying
to have a conversation.

39:13.685 --> 39:14.953
Get the hell out.
Who's this?

39:14.986 --> 39:16.087
Who is this guy?

39:16.121 --> 39:19.090
Lance, this is Joey. Joey,
this is Lance.

39:19.124 --> 39:20.792
Lance?
Hi, how you doing?

39:20.826 --> 39:22.628
Lance...

39:22.661 --> 39:24.463
Wait a second, you're
not going anywhere!

39:24.496 --> 39:25.864
Aah! God!

39:25.897 --> 39:28.066
Jesus Christ,
it's a fucking gun, man.

39:33.071 --> 39:34.740
Well, fuck!

39:35.807 --> 39:37.075
JOEY:
Get in the car.

39:37.108 --> 39:39.578
What car?
This car.

39:46.752 --> 39:48.887
What are you doing?

39:48.920 --> 39:50.522
Stealing a car.

39:50.556 --> 39:53.191
Joey,
what is going on?

39:53.224 --> 39:54.826
So who's the guy
with the tattoos?

39:54.860 --> 39:57.663
We're in a stolen car,
you've got a gun.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.264
Where are we going?
It's not loaded.

39:59.297 --> 40:00.566
Who is he?

40:00.599 --> 40:03.068
You disappeared for an hour.

40:03.101 --> 40:04.302
Is that blood?

40:04.335 --> 40:06.071
Is that that blood?
Is that--?

40:06.104 --> 40:07.439
Who--? Who is he?

40:07.473 --> 40:11.276
He's some guy I used to fuck,
okay? Now are you happy?

40:14.112 --> 40:15.213
Pat Boone?

40:15.246 --> 40:16.882
I'm trying to get him
off my back!

40:16.915 --> 40:18.016
Well, he's off!

40:18.049 --> 40:21.052
Because we're
getting out of town.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.821
What?

40:22.854 --> 40:24.590
We're getting out of town.
What?

40:24.623 --> 40:26.257
We're hitting the road?
Stop the car.

40:26.291 --> 40:28.694
Stop the car.

40:28.727 --> 40:30.028
Stop the car!

40:32.698 --> 40:35.033
Now, Joey,
what are you talking about?

40:35.066 --> 40:37.302
I answered your question,
now you answer mine.

40:37.335 --> 40:38.737
What is going on?

40:38.770 --> 40:40.606
I'm in a little bit
of trouble

40:40.639 --> 40:43.174
and it would be a lot easier
if we could just blow.

40:43.208 --> 40:45.544
What kind of trouble?

40:45.577 --> 40:47.646
I'm not gonna begin
to get you involved right now.

40:47.679 --> 40:48.980
I just met you.

40:49.014 --> 40:50.582
I don't know
who you are or what you do.

40:50.616 --> 40:53.318
I'm a car thief.
All right?

40:53.351 --> 40:55.721
I'm not a very good one,
I-- I--

40:55.754 --> 40:58.557
This is for show, okay?
I don't even need this thing.

41:01.527 --> 41:02.694
How about it?

41:06.665 --> 41:09.000
I just can't be impulsive.

41:09.034 --> 41:12.470
Mona, you asked me to move in
with you 12 hours after
we met.

41:12.504 --> 41:15.273
Yeah, well,
I just can't run like that.

41:15.306 --> 41:16.842
You're gonna
have to go without me.

41:21.446 --> 41:22.514
I'm sorry.

42:24.576 --> 42:26.745
Pardon me, sir

42:26.778 --> 42:29.447
Stop flirting with her

42:29.480 --> 42:34.485
The lady's with me

42:34.519 --> 42:36.755
With that come-hither stare

42:36.788 --> 42:39.758
It can't get you nowhere

42:39.791 --> 42:43.161
The lady's with me

42:44.229 --> 42:46.665
You're not to blame

42:46.698 --> 42:49.400
For digging a dame

42:56.675 --> 42:59.010
But let me repeat

42:59.811 --> 43:01.647
What do you want, Turks?

43:01.680 --> 43:03.214
What kind of car
is it this time?

43:03.248 --> 43:04.449
JOEY:
It's not a car.

43:04.482 --> 43:06.384
What?
Are you pimping now?

43:06.417 --> 43:08.720
No, Ack,
I need some info.

43:12.190 --> 43:13.692
Libido, what's the word?

43:13.725 --> 43:15.093
That's out of your league,
kid.

43:15.126 --> 43:17.696
I pay you for information,
not advice.

43:17.729 --> 43:19.831
I smell what I smell.

43:19.865 --> 43:21.900
There's only
one hatch available.

43:21.933 --> 43:23.468
Who's got it?

43:23.501 --> 43:24.870
Somebody lifted it
from Spuntz.

43:24.903 --> 43:26.237
Ack, I know that.

43:26.271 --> 43:28.640
Now swallow your chow and
give me some straight answers.

43:28.674 --> 43:29.741
I need names.

43:34.980 --> 43:36.281
You're killing me.

43:37.849 --> 43:39.484
Somebody hit Mort.

43:39.517 --> 43:43.288
The stuff is gone but
it ain't on the
streets, anywhere.

43:43.321 --> 43:45.757
There's a big silence
around town.

43:45.791 --> 43:47.826
Loud silence, boy.

43:47.859 --> 43:50.095
Check with Sammy Rhodes.
He may know something.

43:50.128 --> 43:52.063
What's Sammy
got to do with this?

43:52.097 --> 43:55.566
He's a philosopher.
He knows things.

43:55.600 --> 43:56.868
What's it worth?

44:02.407 --> 44:04.575
Spuntz laid a big egg.

44:04.609 --> 44:07.412
All his cash,
a million at least.

44:07.445 --> 44:08.513
A million?

44:09.815 --> 44:11.750
Joey,

44:11.783 --> 44:15.821
you never saw me
and I never told you anything.

44:17.889 --> 44:20.826
I never saw you, Ack?

44:28.599 --> 44:30.736
Hey, Mr. Lee!

44:30.769 --> 44:32.503
More chow fun.

44:35.473 --> 44:37.542
Okay.

44:37.575 --> 44:40.879
I've given you
your place in the universe,

44:40.912 --> 44:42.513
and now you must--

44:42.547 --> 44:44.182
Sammy.

44:44.215 --> 44:46.317
Sammy, how you been?

44:46.351 --> 44:48.053
Joseph.

44:55.426 --> 44:56.962
It's good to see you.

44:56.995 --> 44:58.897
It's good to see you.

44:58.930 --> 45:01.066
I had a dream about you.

45:01.099 --> 45:02.633
About the old days?

45:02.667 --> 45:05.236
My dreams aren't necessarily
rooted in reality.

45:05.270 --> 45:08.373
I saw your face.

45:08.406 --> 45:09.574
You were a goat.

45:09.607 --> 45:11.509
Ah.

45:11.542 --> 45:13.478
You were grazing on my lawn.

45:13.511 --> 45:14.712
Look at my lawn.

45:14.746 --> 45:17.615
See how perfectly trim it is?

45:17.648 --> 45:19.484
You did a beautiful job.

45:20.952 --> 45:24.089
My dreams lately have been
about the
symbiotic relationships.

45:24.122 --> 45:27.492
You gained nutrition
from my lawn.

45:27.525 --> 45:29.961
My lawn stayed
perfectly trimmed.

45:29.995 --> 45:31.296
I was a happier man.

45:31.329 --> 45:34.565
I-It's like my garden.

45:34.599 --> 45:37.002
Everything laid out
in perfect balance.

45:37.035 --> 45:39.704
Symmetry.

45:39.737 --> 45:42.440
Harmony.

45:42.473 --> 45:43.909
Survival.

45:43.942 --> 45:45.110
Hm.

45:45.143 --> 45:47.278
Well, it must
be working for you.

45:47.312 --> 45:48.446
I mean,
look at this place.

45:48.479 --> 45:50.681
Jeez.
Heh.

45:50.715 --> 45:51.983
What can I do for you?

45:53.684 --> 45:54.920
I'm getting
a lot of heat on me

45:54.953 --> 45:56.687
to track down
this drug called libido.

45:57.923 --> 46:00.691
I was wondering maybe
you might be able to--

46:00.725 --> 46:03.094
No.

46:03.128 --> 46:07.032
I am completely
out of that world now.

46:07.065 --> 46:08.934
Look at me.
What do you see?

46:08.967 --> 46:10.101
Look at me.

46:10.135 --> 46:11.870
Look in me.

46:11.903 --> 46:13.504
You see a clean man.

46:13.538 --> 46:14.705
Completely clean.

46:14.739 --> 46:16.441
How do you think I
got all this?

46:16.474 --> 46:18.276
I got out of the world
that you are in.

46:18.309 --> 46:20.678
You can get out.

46:20.711 --> 46:22.413
I wanna get out.

46:22.447 --> 46:24.883
And I got a woman now
and I think I have a way out.

46:24.916 --> 46:26.084
What way is that?

46:26.117 --> 46:27.252
Well...

46:31.957 --> 46:34.860
I have a vision of you

46:34.893 --> 46:37.095
with a bullet in your face.
You see it also.

46:37.128 --> 46:39.630
I find this stuff,
I'm sitting on a
million bucks.

46:39.664 --> 46:41.032
You know,
why should they get it?

46:41.066 --> 46:43.434
I need your help
as a partner.

46:43.468 --> 46:45.436
I can't do this myself.

46:45.470 --> 46:49.240
The dirty world
is dangling a carrot.

46:49.274 --> 46:50.741
Go clean.

46:52.577 --> 46:54.279
Could I nibble just a bit?
Heh.

46:54.312 --> 46:57.615
Joey, I love you,

46:57.648 --> 46:59.784
but you're on your own.

47:26.912 --> 47:29.447
I knew you'd call, baby.

47:29.480 --> 47:31.382
Well, this is the last time.

47:31.416 --> 47:33.885
Yeah, I'm sure of that.

47:33.919 --> 47:37.088
So where is
the little gangster?

47:37.122 --> 47:39.824
I figured he'd be
moved in here by now.

47:39.857 --> 47:42.260
How long did that take,
about three hours?

47:42.293 --> 47:44.762
Now, what is it that I can
do for you, I wonder?

47:44.795 --> 47:47.232
Don't act stupid.
You know.

47:48.433 --> 47:50.801
Yeah, I guess I do.

47:54.072 --> 47:57.242
One little piggie.

47:57.275 --> 48:00.245
Two little piggies.

48:01.146 --> 48:03.915
That'll last you
till tomorrow.

48:03.949 --> 48:05.750
Go ahead, take it.

48:05.783 --> 48:07.318
I can wait.

48:07.352 --> 48:09.420
Mm.

48:11.722 --> 48:13.324
How bad does it get?

48:15.293 --> 48:17.528
You're just a little girl,
aren't you?

48:20.398 --> 48:22.100
Sweet little girl.

48:23.501 --> 48:24.970
Who loves to fuck.

48:31.876 --> 48:33.111
Hello?

48:33.144 --> 48:34.379
JOEY:
Hello, Mona?

48:34.412 --> 48:36.514
MONA:
Joey? Come home.
Where are you?

48:36.547 --> 48:38.516
I'm working.

48:38.549 --> 48:39.784
I got some stuff to do.

48:39.817 --> 48:41.019
MONA:
Just leave it.

48:41.052 --> 48:42.820
I really need you.

48:42.853 --> 48:44.122
What's wrong?

48:44.155 --> 48:46.891
MONA:
Nothing.

48:46.924 --> 48:48.626
Just come home, okay?

48:50.428 --> 48:51.796
Okay.

49:00.105 --> 49:01.772
Bart, I can't--

49:01.806 --> 49:05.043
I was just about to call you,
here you are.

49:05.076 --> 49:06.377
What a c-- You know,

49:06.411 --> 49:08.546
I've been working on this
and finding some things.

49:08.579 --> 49:10.615
Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey.

49:10.648 --> 49:13.784
I should kill you.

49:13.818 --> 49:17.388
But I can't, so...
Follow me?

49:25.063 --> 49:26.464
Would you cut it out?
That's my chair.

49:26.497 --> 49:28.299
You take the tiny one.

49:35.106 --> 49:36.841
I'm sorry about last night.

49:36.874 --> 49:38.209
Look, I--

49:38.243 --> 49:40.478
If I knew something,
I'd tell you.

49:40.511 --> 49:42.613
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

49:50.988 --> 49:52.290
How are you?

49:52.323 --> 49:54.125
I'm-- I'm good.

49:54.159 --> 49:55.193
Ahh.

49:55.226 --> 49:57.828
That's...

49:57.862 --> 49:59.630
Ahh...

49:59.664 --> 50:01.532
Joey?

50:02.767 --> 50:04.569
Who killed Mort, Joey?

50:05.503 --> 50:07.372
Hell. I'm in hell.

50:07.405 --> 50:09.640
You haven't gone to the cops,
have you, Joey?

50:09.674 --> 50:12.510
Cops? No,
I haven't gone to the cops.

50:15.080 --> 50:16.281
Hank?

50:17.815 --> 50:19.350
It's been a while.

50:19.384 --> 50:21.052
Yeah.

50:21.086 --> 50:22.220
One day.

50:23.688 --> 50:27.725
Well, hello, big boy.

50:27.758 --> 50:29.294
Hey,
isn't this your old turf?

50:29.327 --> 50:30.628
Huh?

50:30.661 --> 50:34.265
You still selling your...

50:34.299 --> 50:37.001
...meat on Santa Monica
Boulevard? Huh?

50:39.337 --> 50:41.939
Let's go for a ride,
tiger.

51:01.959 --> 51:05.696
I've had it
with your bullshit, Joseph.

51:05.730 --> 51:07.665
It's boring.

51:07.698 --> 51:09.667
JOEY:
Hank!

51:11.302 --> 51:13.104
Wherever you go,
stiffs follow.

51:13.138 --> 51:14.605
Why don't you just calm down,
Hank?

51:14.639 --> 51:15.706
You know.
I don't.

51:15.740 --> 51:18.008
You know!

51:18.042 --> 51:19.744
Spuntz. Ack.

51:19.777 --> 51:22.513
I know you've been seeing
those filthy cocksuckers.

51:22.547 --> 51:23.714
You've been playing with me.

51:23.748 --> 51:25.316
I'm gonna come through.

51:25.350 --> 51:27.885
And nobody plays with Dick!

51:27.918 --> 51:29.320
Nobody.

51:29.354 --> 51:31.656
Nobody, nobody, nobody!

51:31.689 --> 51:34.192
I'm working with you,
partner.

51:35.393 --> 51:36.994
Partner!

51:38.429 --> 51:41.299
I'm gonna
waste you right now.

51:41.332 --> 51:44.402
But you're not worth the space
you'd take up in a cell.

51:44.435 --> 51:45.570
It's the truth.

51:45.603 --> 51:47.505
You fucks have never
told me the truth.

51:47.538 --> 51:51.108
Forty years I've tried to
scrub you fucks off
the street.

51:51.142 --> 51:54.812
You fucks, you fucks,
you fucks, you fucks!

51:54.845 --> 51:57.047
You fucks aren't gonna
ruin my life!

51:57.081 --> 51:59.217
I'm going out of here
with flying colors,

51:59.250 --> 52:00.418
you weasel!

52:00.451 --> 52:02.520
Hank, drugs. It's drugs!

52:02.553 --> 52:05.323
Spuntz's. Somebody killed
Mort and stole 'em.

52:05.356 --> 52:07.057
I think it was Spuntz.

52:07.091 --> 52:09.827
He hides his drugs,
he kills his own people,

52:09.860 --> 52:11.529
and the street value
goes up,

52:11.562 --> 52:12.897
and I'm on the inside now.

52:12.930 --> 52:15.200
I will deliver.
I won't lie to you.

52:15.233 --> 52:16.467
You'll crack this case.

52:16.501 --> 52:18.669
Please, just put the gun away.

52:20.738 --> 52:22.307
Please.

52:24.809 --> 52:26.444
I do bad things.

52:26.477 --> 52:28.579
I-I-- I steal cars. I--

52:28.613 --> 52:31.582
I lift change
off old ladies,

52:31.616 --> 52:33.251
but I am not in with Spuntz.

52:39.990 --> 52:41.426
Thank you.

52:41.459 --> 52:44.862
Oh, jeez.
You hungry, Hank?

52:47.998 --> 52:49.800
Stinking little shit.

53:13.391 --> 53:15.426
LANCE:
Well, I'm a hunk
A hunk, a hunk

53:15.460 --> 53:16.994
A hunk, a hunk

53:18.095 --> 53:19.730
Get out, Lance!

53:19.764 --> 53:22.533
That's no way to greet
your little love toy.

53:22.567 --> 53:25.636
Please, don't do this to
me now. Don't do this to me!

53:25.670 --> 53:27.972
Aw, come on, baby,
he ain't coming back.

53:28.005 --> 53:29.940
But Daddy's here.

53:29.974 --> 53:31.542
I hate your guts!

53:31.576 --> 53:33.711
I love your ass! Ha!

53:33.744 --> 53:35.079
Turn it on.

53:35.112 --> 53:36.281
A hunk, a hunk, a hunk

53:36.314 --> 53:38.148
No.

53:38.182 --> 53:39.884
No.
Hey.

53:41.752 --> 53:43.488
Just go with it, baby.

53:43.521 --> 53:45.656
Please, don't do this now.

53:45.690 --> 53:47.358
Come on.

53:47.392 --> 53:49.994
Don't be like that.

53:50.027 --> 53:51.161
You know you want it.

53:53.598 --> 53:55.933
It's a long ride.

53:55.966 --> 53:59.870
You're not supposed
to be here now.

53:59.904 --> 54:02.172
He's just using you.

54:02.206 --> 54:04.509
He's just like
all the others.

54:06.944 --> 54:10.281
No, it's true.
He doesn't understand you.

54:10.315 --> 54:12.049
Not the way I do.

54:12.082 --> 54:15.085
You don't wanna be alone,
do you? Do you?

54:15.119 --> 54:17.455
No.

54:17.488 --> 54:18.923
You need me.

54:18.956 --> 54:20.224
I don't need you.

54:20.257 --> 54:21.859
I don't need you.

54:21.892 --> 54:23.127
Yes, you do.

54:23.160 --> 54:24.562
No, I don't.

54:24.595 --> 54:28.065
Yes, you do,
because I'm a hunk.

54:30.701 --> 54:32.002
Come on, baby.

54:32.036 --> 54:33.103
Come on.

54:35.840 --> 54:39.644
The lady's with me

54:41.912 --> 54:44.849
You're not to blame

54:44.882 --> 54:47.985
For digging a dame

54:48.018 --> 54:51.389
Of such quality

55:57.822 --> 56:00.324
BART:
Hey, hey, hey!

56:00.357 --> 56:03.160
Come to me, my love,
come to me.

56:03.193 --> 56:05.430
Come into the car.

56:08.999 --> 56:12.603
Excuse the sparseness.

56:12.637 --> 56:14.004
I don't live here, Joey,

56:14.038 --> 56:16.841
I'm just using it
for our special dinner.

56:18.308 --> 56:20.478
Eat, Joseph.

56:20.511 --> 56:21.879
And try the wine.

56:21.912 --> 56:23.080
No, thank you.

56:23.113 --> 56:25.049
Oh, but you must.

56:25.082 --> 56:27.017
It's a '71 Margaux.

56:27.051 --> 56:28.385
Drink.

56:31.956 --> 56:34.258
SPUNTZ:
So?

56:34.291 --> 56:36.427
Express yourself about
my wine.

56:38.696 --> 56:39.997
It's good.

57:09.794 --> 57:13.063
You are a simple man,
Mr. Turks.

57:15.633 --> 57:18.035
Bartholomew,
get ahold of yourself.

57:32.917 --> 57:34.619
Ah.

57:35.385 --> 57:36.721
The music.

57:36.754 --> 57:38.756
The drama.

57:38.789 --> 57:40.958
Are you familiar
with Verdi's Otello?

57:40.991 --> 57:44.228
I, um, am not a cultured man,
Mr. Spuntz.

57:44.261 --> 57:48.733
Simple story with a strong
and moving message.

57:48.766 --> 57:51.669
Listen to the passion
in Otello's voice.

57:51.702 --> 57:55.172
He is outraged
and hurt.

57:55.205 --> 57:57.542
Why?

57:57.575 --> 58:00.511
Because Iago,
Otello's servant and inferior,

58:00.545 --> 58:01.846
has betrayed him.

58:01.879 --> 58:06.150
So outraged is Otello
that he will soon kill Iago.

58:07.484 --> 58:10.621
It is so sad.

58:12.222 --> 58:13.423
This is a scam.

58:14.625 --> 58:15.760
You got the drugs.

58:15.793 --> 58:17.628
You're killing
your own people.

58:17.662 --> 58:19.630
You're hiding them so you can
raise the value on the street.

58:19.664 --> 58:21.566
You're next. Right?

58:23.768 --> 58:26.203
Boys,

58:26.236 --> 58:28.238
it is time for me
to retire.

58:28.272 --> 58:30.741
But, stay, Joey,
and have dessert with Bart.

58:30.775 --> 58:32.509
I'm full.

58:32.543 --> 58:35.312
Have dessert. Sit.

58:49.560 --> 58:51.929
Listen, I didn't
tell Hank Dick nothing.

58:51.962 --> 58:54.632
Although he's
been on my ass.

58:54.665 --> 58:56.233
Listen,
Spuntz is gonna kill us both.

58:56.266 --> 58:57.702
We should help each other.

59:11.616 --> 59:14.518
So excited

59:14.551 --> 59:16.821
Oh, yes, I'm so excited

59:18.522 --> 59:20.557
I'm so excited

59:22.492 --> 59:26.296
Look at the times again

59:26.330 --> 59:29.299
I'd do anything
To be with you

59:29.333 --> 59:32.336
We shift the times again

59:32.369 --> 59:33.971
I've heard
these guys on the radio.

59:34.004 --> 59:36.506
What-- Who are they again?

59:36.540 --> 59:38.575
I've tried to hide the pain

59:40.510 --> 59:43.413
And I know
I'm gonna go insane

59:43.447 --> 59:47.284
Breaking my heart again

59:47.317 --> 59:51.021
And again and again
And again

59:51.055 --> 59:53.624
Ah, ha
You've got me so excited

59:53.658 --> 59:55.359
You've got me so excited

59:55.392 --> 59:57.027
I know exactly what to do

59:59.029 --> 01:00:00.330
You've got me so excited

01:00:00.364 --> 01:00:02.867
BART:
Oh, yeah. Whoa. Whoo!

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:06.737
BART:
Aw, yeah, that's good.

01:00:06.771 --> 01:00:07.938
Oh, that's good.

01:00:07.972 --> 01:00:10.841
Whoo!
I feel electric when I dance!

01:00:14.912 --> 01:00:16.213
BART:
Oh, God.

01:00:16.246 --> 01:00:19.083
Love eternal, crank mother!

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:21.852
Ducky, ducky, fuck, fuck!

01:00:21.886 --> 01:00:24.722
Ducky, ducky, fuck, fuck.
Ducky, ducky, fuck, fuck.

01:00:24.755 --> 01:00:27.024
Ducky, ducky, fuck, fuck.
Ducky, ducky, fuck, fuck!

01:00:27.057 --> 01:00:29.159
Ducky, ducky-- Fuck!

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:37.634
Drop your pants, Joey.

01:00:37.668 --> 01:00:38.936
Oh, man.

01:00:48.078 --> 01:00:49.914
Shit.

01:00:49.947 --> 01:00:51.782
Bart, Bart, listen to me!

01:00:51.816 --> 01:00:53.317
You're a marked man.

01:00:54.919 --> 01:00:57.487
I think we can nail Spuntz!
Let's start
something together.

01:00:57.521 --> 01:00:58.889
Come here, Joey,
come here!

01:00:58.923 --> 01:01:01.225
I like your style.
I could use a guy.

01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:04.294
We could go--
Bart, tell me.

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:06.663
How do you stay
in such good shape?

01:01:06.697 --> 01:01:08.866
So excited
You know I'm so excited

01:01:08.899 --> 01:01:10.701
Out of the way.

01:01:12.569 --> 01:01:14.872
Huh? Oh.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.545
Oh, shit.

01:01:21.578 --> 01:01:23.613
You're pathetic.

01:01:23.647 --> 01:01:27.284
I know exactly what to do
Oh, oh

01:01:59.683 --> 01:02:01.085
Mona, what happened?

01:02:01.118 --> 01:02:03.053
Nothing.

01:02:03.087 --> 01:02:04.254
Where did you get these?

01:02:06.256 --> 01:02:09.259
I'm the most fucked up person
in the world.

01:02:09.293 --> 01:02:11.862
Mona, you gotta tell me!

01:02:11.896 --> 01:02:13.363
Mona?

01:02:13.397 --> 01:02:16.300
Joey, please help me.

01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:17.367
I wanna help you.

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:18.869
Please, help me.
I want to.

01:02:18.903 --> 01:02:20.971
I will, but I can't
if you don't tell me

01:02:21.005 --> 01:02:22.873
where you got the pill.

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:26.043
If they don't,
they're gonna kill me.

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:28.412
You hear me?
You-- Mona!

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:33.951
From Pat Boone.

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:42.192
LANCE: Fuck you!

01:02:46.163 --> 01:02:49.166
Well, if it isn't loafer man.

01:02:50.968 --> 01:02:52.502
Where are the drugs?

01:02:53.637 --> 01:02:55.472
I don't sell drugs, man.

01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:56.874
I play guitar.

01:02:56.907 --> 01:03:00.644
Lance, I don't wanna
go crazy on you.

01:03:00.677 --> 01:03:02.779
Why don't you just tell me
where libido is.

01:03:02.813 --> 01:03:06.083
Libido? What's the matter
there, Dillinger?

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:07.918
You having a little trouble
getting it up?

01:03:09.854 --> 01:03:11.889
Getting it up?

01:03:11.922 --> 01:03:13.357
Getting it up.

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:15.325
Getting it up's really,
really fucking easy.

01:03:15.359 --> 01:03:16.493
See, it's just coming--

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:17.995
Get out of here!

01:03:19.864 --> 01:03:21.198
That's a nice move, asshole.

01:03:21.231 --> 01:03:24.068
Not my guitar, but nice move.

01:03:24.101 --> 01:03:26.103
Why don't you
get the fuck out of here?

01:03:26.904 --> 01:03:30.474
All right. Goddamn.

01:03:30.507 --> 01:03:32.442
Asshole!
Jeez, I just had a few.

01:03:32.476 --> 01:03:33.743
I gave 'em to Mona!

01:03:33.777 --> 01:03:34.879
It's time to talk.

01:03:34.912 --> 01:03:37.114
All right, man.
Jesus Christ, I told you!

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:38.415
Would you
fucking lighten up?

01:03:38.448 --> 01:03:40.650
I'm not fucking lying!
Talk, talk!

01:03:40.684 --> 01:03:42.819
I went to Mort like always.

01:03:42.853 --> 01:03:44.821
Bullshit!
He didn't have any to sell.

01:03:44.855 --> 01:03:47.291
Said they weren't his.
I don't believe you.

01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:48.758
It's true.
I need 'em as bad as you.

01:03:48.792 --> 01:03:50.060
I don't believe you, Lance.

01:03:50.094 --> 01:03:52.362
He won't even return
my fucking phone calls.

01:03:55.432 --> 01:03:57.734
Please, Joey.

01:03:57.767 --> 01:04:00.370
Can I call you Joey?

01:04:00.404 --> 01:04:02.306
Look,
I don't wanna die.

01:04:07.744 --> 01:04:09.113
I love Mona.

01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:21.391
What do you want?

01:04:21.425 --> 01:04:23.360
SPUNTZ:
Give me a minute, please.

01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:25.395
No.

01:04:25.429 --> 01:04:27.697
We only have a few
of these pills left.

01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:29.666
Thank you
for the reminder.

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:33.237
Nobody asked you to pump them
in your mouth like M&M's.

01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:36.206
Shut up, you pig.

01:04:38.175 --> 01:04:41.511
I want you to find Turks
and find my product.

01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:44.181
Kill him
or don't come back.

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:45.916
Now, get away.

01:04:51.355 --> 01:04:55.092
You give me reason to leave

01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:58.728
When you know I'll stay

01:04:58.762 --> 01:05:02.766
You give me reason to stay

01:05:02.799 --> 01:05:05.802
Well, I'm on my way

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:09.073
Under this poet's moon

01:05:09.106 --> 01:05:12.276
I move and I speak too soon

01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:14.678
I know needles and nares

01:05:14.711 --> 01:05:16.713
I know Magdalene and Christ

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:20.650
One makes a deal
While the other pays the price

01:05:20.684 --> 01:05:25.956
She can walk crooked
And high and drunk and lost

01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:29.493
While he gets the cross

01:05:29.526 --> 01:05:32.496
How would I know love now?

01:05:36.466 --> 01:05:37.567
HANK :
Yeah?

01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:39.503
Hank, did I wake you?

01:05:39.536 --> 01:05:41.738
Do beans make you fart?
Who is this?

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:43.673
Joey. Joey Turks.

01:05:43.707 --> 01:05:45.609
Filth.

01:05:45.642 --> 01:05:47.477
You still alive?

01:05:47.511 --> 01:05:49.479
Yeah. Ahem. Not for long.

01:05:49.513 --> 01:05:51.781
Well, then things
are looking up.

01:05:51.815 --> 01:05:53.583
Hank, listen,
I need your help.

01:06:20.777 --> 01:06:23.480
BART:
Joe! Joey!

01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:28.252
JOEY:
Bart, why--
Why must we always do this?

01:06:28.285 --> 01:06:29.686
Be reasonable!

01:06:31.388 --> 01:06:34.024
BART:
Joey! I love you!

01:06:34.058 --> 01:06:36.460
JOEY:
Come on, we go way back!

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:37.894
BART:
Joey!

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:44.334
JOEY: I was just trying to
call you! Why don't you have
a car phone?

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.104
Adrenalin

01:06:47.137 --> 01:06:49.673
JOEY:
Bart, let's act like adults!

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.676
Come on, now stop the car!

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:56.380
JOEY:
I meant--

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:07.557
Get in! I pushed him!

01:07:07.591 --> 01:07:09.293
Get in, get in!

01:07:09.326 --> 01:07:10.794
Did you see that shit?

01:07:10.827 --> 01:07:12.129
Aw, man, that's a ride.

01:07:17.501 --> 01:07:18.868
Aw, Jesus.

01:07:26.176 --> 01:07:27.844
I'm gonna kill you.

01:07:32.182 --> 01:07:33.483
Mona!

01:07:34.951 --> 01:07:37.487
Lance, Jesus, get off of me!

01:07:37.521 --> 01:07:38.888
Please. No.
I love you.

01:07:38.922 --> 01:07:40.757
I'm sorry for all the things
I didn't say.

01:07:50.934 --> 01:07:53.703
I love you!
Get off of me, Lance!

01:07:54.838 --> 01:07:57.307
BART:
Oh, ow, ow.

01:07:57.341 --> 01:07:58.542
You!

01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:00.377
Where can I find
your boyfriend, baby?

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:01.845
Don't point
that gun at her.

01:08:01.878 --> 01:08:03.547
Shut up.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.149
You wanna go for a ride too,
rock star?

01:08:05.182 --> 01:08:06.350
Not really.
Get up.

01:08:06.383 --> 01:08:08.552
But I'll go.

01:08:08.585 --> 01:08:10.787
DUMAS:
This is the perfect hideout,
man.

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:12.156
JOEY:
They'll find us here.

01:08:12.189 --> 01:08:14.358
We gotta get out of here.

01:08:14.391 --> 01:08:16.292
No, listen.

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:18.595
If somebody
was trying to kill you,

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:20.930
the last place you'd go
is for a bite to eat.

01:08:20.964 --> 01:08:22.232
Right?

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:24.667
Somebody is trying to kill me.

01:08:24.701 --> 01:08:25.769
I'm not hungry.

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:27.237
That's the point.

01:08:29.406 --> 01:08:32.776
You eat, you live.

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:35.779
Beautiful, man.

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:38.848
Buckle
your goddamn seatbelts.

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:41.117
I don't-- I don't think
there's a seatbelt back here.

01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:42.618
Buckle the fuck up,
skank!

01:08:42.652 --> 01:08:44.587
All right, all right,
I'm looking for it, man.

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:46.790
Relax.

01:08:46.823 --> 01:08:49.225
We're gonna find
your little boyfriend,

01:08:49.259 --> 01:08:51.461
and we're gonna kill
your little boyfriend,

01:08:51.495 --> 01:08:53.430
and it's gonna be such fun,
isn't it?

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:55.232
I found it! I found
the seatbelt, man. I got it.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:59.169
No, man.

01:08:59.203 --> 01:09:02.171
I got it.
I got the groove.

01:09:02.206 --> 01:09:03.840
I got it right here.

01:09:03.872 --> 01:09:06.510
Oh, and look
at Mommy's children,

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:08.712
looking like they really
want some medicine.

01:09:08.745 --> 01:09:10.247
Do you want some medicine?

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:11.747
Would you like some?

01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:14.251
I'd like one,
since you have so many.

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:16.920
Sure. Just one?

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:21.957
Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.799
I've never felt so alive.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.368
You know when the last time
I ate was?

01:09:31.401 --> 01:09:32.536
Three days ago.

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:33.937
I was bored.

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:36.104
It's all boredom, man.

01:09:36.139 --> 01:09:37.274
Now I'm into something.

01:09:37.307 --> 01:09:38.475
It's a feast. Mm.

01:09:41.077 --> 01:09:42.546
So, what is all this, man?

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:43.613
Tell me.

01:09:43.647 --> 01:09:45.215
Look.
Do me a favor, will you?

01:09:45.249 --> 01:09:47.417
Just let me think
for a second here.

01:09:48.752 --> 01:09:51.688
Hey, man, I saved your life.

01:09:55.859 --> 01:09:57.561
You don't wanna
get involved in this.

01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:02.266
I'm gonna get in
as deep as possible.

01:10:02.299 --> 01:10:06.403
I'm gonna find him and
I'm gonna fucking kill him.

01:10:06.436 --> 01:10:07.937
I'm gonna
fucking kill him,

01:10:07.971 --> 01:10:10.006
and then I'm gonna
fucking fuck him!

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:12.442
I'm gonna fucking kill him,
and then I'm gonna fuck him,

01:10:12.476 --> 01:10:14.811
and then I'm gonna fuck
the two of you!

01:10:14.844 --> 01:10:16.846
Ha-ha-ha! I'm gonna
fuck the two of you!

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.682
Stop it!
I'm gonna fuck the two of you!

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:21.551
All the great artists got
themselves deep in the shit.

01:10:21.585 --> 01:10:23.620
And when they got out,
they got bored.

01:10:23.653 --> 01:10:26.155
Look at Hemingway.

01:10:26.189 --> 01:10:27.557
Blew his brains out.

01:10:28.825 --> 01:10:30.794
Gun right in his mouth.

01:10:30.827 --> 01:10:33.297
BART:
Yoo-hoo.

01:10:34.764 --> 01:10:38.535
Ah, your little boyfriend
is here.

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:41.070
The closer you are to death...

01:10:41.104 --> 01:10:43.273
Isn't that just a pleasure?

01:10:46.510 --> 01:10:48.144
The more alive you are.

01:10:48.177 --> 01:10:49.279
No!

01:10:50.647 --> 01:10:53.483
Adrenaline

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:57.287
Adrenaline

01:10:57.321 --> 01:10:59.623
Adrenaline, adrenaline
Adrenaline

01:11:02.359 --> 01:11:04.060
Adrenaline

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:07.464
Adrenaline, adrenaline
Adrenaline

01:11:10.033 --> 01:11:11.968
Adrenaline

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:14.371
Adrenaline, adrenaline
Adrenaline

01:11:17.407 --> 01:11:18.708
Adrenaline

01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:23.279
Adrenaline

01:11:23.313 --> 01:11:25.682
Oh, no!

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:27.717
Sammy!

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.755
Sam?

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:33.757
JOEY:
Sammy.

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:35.425
Sammy, you out here?

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:08.692
Joey?

01:12:10.193 --> 01:12:12.295
Why are you lurking
in my garden?

01:12:16.866 --> 01:12:18.968
I need your help, Sammy.

01:12:19.002 --> 01:12:20.136
Can you lend me some money?

01:12:22.639 --> 01:12:25.509
I don't lend money, Joey.
I make it.

01:12:25.542 --> 01:12:27.176
Loans are
against my nature.

01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:29.713
What's your problem?

01:12:29.746 --> 01:12:32.148
I'm in over my head.
Spuntz wants to kill me.

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:34.183
Uh-huh.

01:12:34.217 --> 01:12:35.284
And what do you want?

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:39.689
I wanna stay alive.

01:12:39.723 --> 01:12:42.025
I wanna make some money.
I wanna get out of this town.

01:12:42.058 --> 01:12:45.995
As I recall, Joey,
I told you to get out.

01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:49.232
Yeah, well, I'm in,
so can you help me?

01:12:51.435 --> 01:12:53.302
I'm begging you, please.

01:12:53.336 --> 01:12:55.505
Look at you.

01:12:55.539 --> 01:12:57.641
Always in a big rush.

01:12:57.674 --> 01:12:59.275
Always the quick buck.

01:12:59.308 --> 01:13:01.478
Never took full advantage
of the situation.

01:13:01.511 --> 01:13:04.180
You have to think.

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:06.583
Use your head.

01:13:06.616 --> 01:13:09.252
Go back to the beginning.

01:13:09.285 --> 01:13:10.887
Be thorough.

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.489
Retrace your steps.

01:13:20.196 --> 01:13:21.931
What, that's it?

01:13:21.965 --> 01:13:26.703
Joey, you're the boss now,
not me.

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:29.673
Use your goddamned head.

01:14:46.583 --> 01:14:49.953
Mort. You little fuck.

01:14:58.127 --> 01:15:00.096
MONA:
This is getting
a little crazy, Joey.

01:15:00.129 --> 01:15:02.265
I thought you were dead.

01:15:02.298 --> 01:15:03.833
I'm not.

01:15:03.867 --> 01:15:05.134
What's in the suitcase?

01:15:05.168 --> 01:15:07.837
Give me a minute.

01:15:12.175 --> 01:15:13.543
Who's after you, Joey?

01:15:14.678 --> 01:15:16.245
It's me. It's Joey.

01:15:16.279 --> 01:15:18.347
This is the last favor
I am ever gonna ask you.

01:15:18.381 --> 01:15:20.049
I'm gonna need
a hundred thousand.

01:15:20.083 --> 01:15:22.619
It's worth
10 times that.

01:15:22.652 --> 01:15:25.689
Then get me in touch with
someone I can unload it on.

01:15:25.722 --> 01:15:28.257
Yeah. Yes.

01:15:28.291 --> 01:15:29.826
No.

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:31.561
Uh, ring me here.

01:15:31.595 --> 01:15:34.163
At 555--
4812.

01:15:34.197 --> 01:15:36.132
4812.

01:15:36.165 --> 01:15:39.402
Meet me at the southeast
corner of the
Sunnyside Cemetery.

01:15:39.435 --> 01:15:40.536
Sunnyside.

01:15:42.238 --> 01:15:43.472
That's for real.

01:15:43.506 --> 01:15:46.542
And listen, I swear to God--

01:15:51.214 --> 01:15:53.082
Well, this is quite
a career transition.

01:15:53.116 --> 01:15:54.350
Mona, I'm being used.

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:56.252
I'm-- I'm being squeezed
from both sides.

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:58.421
In about two hours I'm gonna
be rid of all this shit,

01:15:58.454 --> 01:16:00.456
and I'm gonna get out of town
and you're coming with me.

01:16:00.489 --> 01:16:01.725
And going where?

01:16:01.758 --> 01:16:03.326
Anywhere.

01:16:03.359 --> 01:16:04.594
I love you.

01:16:04.628 --> 01:16:06.663
Heh. You've known me
for three days.

01:16:06.696 --> 01:16:09.599
I-- I like you then.

01:16:09.633 --> 01:16:11.500
Look, we--
We belong together.

01:16:11.534 --> 01:16:14.170
How's that?
The two of us,

01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:17.774
we're both...losers.

01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:19.843
Well, I guess you have
a point about that.

01:16:23.246 --> 01:16:26.349
Why don't you just
put the gun down, Bart?

01:16:26.382 --> 01:16:28.484
I just tried calling you.
Where the hell were you?

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:30.553
It's all over, pud.

01:16:30.586 --> 01:16:33.356
SPUNTZ:
I am the very model
Of a modern major general

01:16:33.389 --> 01:16:36.459
I've information veg--

01:16:36.492 --> 01:16:37.727
Hello, Joseph.

01:16:37.761 --> 01:16:41.030
I'm sorry about
Bart's manners.

01:16:41.064 --> 01:16:45.168
I've told him over and over
to respect a man's castle.

01:16:45.201 --> 01:16:47.904
You can only spank a farm boy
so many times.

01:16:49.372 --> 01:16:50.640
And how are you, miss?

01:16:50.674 --> 01:16:52.541
Joey, who the fuck
are these guys?

01:16:52.575 --> 01:16:54.410
I think she's behind
the whole thing.

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:56.012
Why don't you just
leave her out of it?

01:16:56.045 --> 01:16:59.548
Are we a little spunky today,
Mr. Hero?

01:16:59.582 --> 01:17:01.450
Now, Bart,

01:17:01.484 --> 01:17:04.087
don't take your own
frustrations out on
other people.

01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:07.556
Do you mind if I sit?

01:17:10.426 --> 01:17:11.828
Thank you.

01:17:11.861 --> 01:17:13.663
BART:
Oh, no, you don't.

01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:26.642
Bart.

01:17:26.676 --> 01:17:29.979
Please help me, will you?
I'm stuck.

01:17:32.749 --> 01:17:35.451
You are a pig.

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:36.820
Hey!

01:17:40.023 --> 01:17:43.993
Why don't you lose
a few tons?

01:17:44.027 --> 01:17:46.162
For chrissakes.

01:17:49.565 --> 01:17:51.367
Why, thank you,
Joseph.

01:17:52.802 --> 01:17:55.171
Please, sit down.

01:17:55.204 --> 01:17:56.572
Sit down.

01:17:59.642 --> 01:18:01.477
Were you planning a trip?

01:18:03.312 --> 01:18:05.514
Mona was.

01:18:05.548 --> 01:18:07.884
Visiting her mother.

01:18:07.917 --> 01:18:12.889
SPUNTZ:
Oh? How nice. Where is home?

01:18:12.922 --> 01:18:14.623
Connecticut.

01:18:14.657 --> 01:18:15.925
Oh, really?

01:18:15.959 --> 01:18:17.894
I know the state well.

01:18:17.927 --> 01:18:20.029
I was a Yalie man myself.

01:18:20.063 --> 01:18:22.565
Oh, you were a Yalie flunkie.

01:18:22.598 --> 01:18:25.101
Shut up,
you degenerate hick.

01:18:34.377 --> 01:18:37.013
Joseph,

01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:38.882
I must apologize to you.

01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:43.219
When I told you the story
about Otello and Iago.

01:18:43.252 --> 01:18:46.355
Otello does not kill Iago
in the end,

01:18:46.389 --> 01:18:48.424
but as far as I'm concerned,
he should have.

01:18:57.666 --> 01:18:59.502
Damn it to hell.
Where is it?

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:06.042
And now I'm going
to kill you, son.

01:19:09.946 --> 01:19:12.681
Have you no information
for me, my child?

01:19:12.715 --> 01:19:14.283
I need a few more hours.

01:19:14.317 --> 01:19:15.751
Look, I've almost found
the drug,

01:19:15.785 --> 01:19:17.720
but if you kill me
you're never gonna find 'em.

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:19.956
You're right, Joey.

01:19:19.989 --> 01:19:21.490
So we'll kill her.

01:19:25.394 --> 01:19:27.230
JOEY:
Okay, okay.

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:29.565
MONA: Joey?
Okay.

01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:31.134
Stop it!
Mm.

01:19:31.167 --> 01:19:32.268
MONA:
Joey.

01:19:32.301 --> 01:19:33.937
I'll talk!
MONA: Stop it.

01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:35.538
Joey!
Mm, mm.

01:19:35.571 --> 01:19:37.540
Suitcase!

01:19:37.573 --> 01:19:39.508
They're in the
goddamn suitcase.

01:19:41.544 --> 01:19:43.212
Thank you, Joey.

01:19:46.816 --> 01:19:49.352
Freeze!
Homicide Dick.

01:19:49.385 --> 01:19:50.920
Hank, how you doing?

01:19:52.922 --> 01:19:54.958
I thought
I smelled something up here.

01:19:54.991 --> 01:19:57.526
H. Spuntz. Come on.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:58.661
Put it away. Here.

01:19:58.694 --> 01:20:01.097
Come on over here, bucko.

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:03.799
And the other one.

01:20:03.833 --> 01:20:05.902
You too, little cock.

01:20:09.572 --> 01:20:10.840
Ah.

01:20:10.874 --> 01:20:13.910
Mr. Dick, the legend.

01:20:13.943 --> 01:20:18.014
I thought you were suspended
for breaking that
fellow's nose.

01:20:18.047 --> 01:20:19.615
Taken off the street?

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:22.418
Yeah? Well,
I'm up your ass now, fatty.

01:20:25.454 --> 01:20:28.324
Hey, this is Mona.
Mona, this is Detective Dick.

01:20:28.357 --> 01:20:30.126
Would anyone
like some beverages?

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:32.161
Just shut your yapper,
Jose.

01:20:32.195 --> 01:20:34.998
I'll get it.

01:20:35.031 --> 01:20:36.665
Yeah?

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:41.404
Cemetery. An hour is fine.

01:20:41.437 --> 01:20:43.306
Who was that?

01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:45.508
Who's this?

01:20:45.541 --> 01:20:46.609
Open the door.

01:20:53.049 --> 01:20:55.018
Who are you?
Is Mona here?

01:20:55.051 --> 01:20:57.686
Him? Get him--
God. wh--? Get out of here!

01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:59.088
Do you know this guy?

01:20:59.122 --> 01:21:00.256
Yeah.

01:21:00.289 --> 01:21:02.025
HANK:
Well, get rid of him, honey.

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:04.727
MONA:
Excuse me.

01:21:06.295 --> 01:21:08.364
Are you alone?

01:21:15.004 --> 01:21:17.006
I feel like
I'm on top of the world.

01:21:18.274 --> 01:21:21.377
And I wanna thank Junior here
for all of his help,

01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:24.213
not to mention
my own 40-year intuition.

01:21:24.247 --> 01:21:26.082
You have nothing on me.

01:21:26.115 --> 01:21:28.384
You?

01:21:28.417 --> 01:21:30.219
Ah, move your humper.

01:21:34.190 --> 01:21:36.525
Move your humpers!

01:21:38.161 --> 01:21:40.229
All right,
you look very nice today.

01:21:40.263 --> 01:21:41.897
Get up against the wall.
Get over here!

01:21:41.931 --> 01:21:42.966
Get in there.

01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:47.203
Good work, son.

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:49.939
Thank you, Hank.

01:21:49.973 --> 01:21:52.308
Pack your things, meet me
in the cemetery in one hour.

01:21:52.341 --> 01:21:53.909
But, Joey--

01:21:53.943 --> 01:21:56.845
Look, if you don't come
with me, I'm going alone.

01:21:56.879 --> 01:21:58.414
That won't work.

01:22:01.684 --> 01:22:03.586
Was--? Was it
the pills all this time

01:22:03.619 --> 01:22:05.188
that made you
feel something for me?

01:22:07.523 --> 01:22:08.824
I don't think so.

01:22:10.559 --> 01:22:11.660
Good.

01:22:18.634 --> 01:22:22.505
At last I have your fat ass,
Spuntz!

01:22:22.538 --> 01:22:24.540
Oh!

01:22:36.119 --> 01:22:38.854
Open the cuffs.
Give me the gun.
Fuck you. Fuck you!

01:22:46.895 --> 01:22:48.731
No, no! Not the--

01:22:53.069 --> 01:22:55.104
BART:
What are you holding back,
you fat fuck?

01:22:58.574 --> 01:22:59.942
No! No!

01:23:08.351 --> 01:23:09.918
BART:
You dick.

01:23:09.952 --> 01:23:11.120
Fuck you.

01:23:15.391 --> 01:23:16.592
There he is!

01:23:16.625 --> 01:23:18.027
Come on, you bozo!

01:23:32.208 --> 01:23:33.542
Don't lose him.

01:23:33.576 --> 01:23:35.878
Shut up, you fat slob.

01:23:51.194 --> 01:23:54.797
Mona, I'm here to work out
our relationship.

01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:57.366
I think we may be
a little codependent.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.635
And I want you to know
that I'm a new man.

01:23:59.668 --> 01:24:00.903
I've changed.

01:24:00.936 --> 01:24:03.939
I wanna settle down
and I love you.

01:24:03.972 --> 01:24:05.541
Let's run away together.

01:24:05.574 --> 01:24:07.143
Can you hold on one second?

01:24:30.099 --> 01:24:33.569
SPUNTZ:
What the hell is this?
Get us out of this mess!

01:24:33.602 --> 01:24:36.305
Damn it. Where's Turks?
Have you lost him?

01:24:36.339 --> 01:24:39.775
Oh, God. Come on, you!

01:24:39.808 --> 01:24:42.010
Is this even the
right cemetery, you baboon?

01:24:42.044 --> 01:24:43.512
You lost him, damn it,
you lost him.

01:24:43.546 --> 01:24:47.183
Can't get into
a goddamn graveyard?

01:24:47.216 --> 01:24:49.318
For chrissake.
Look at this. Look!

01:25:07.203 --> 01:25:08.771
Shit.

01:25:23.152 --> 01:25:24.753
Hello, Joey.

01:25:24.787 --> 01:25:26.054
Sammy?

01:25:26.088 --> 01:25:27.290
Joey.

01:25:27.323 --> 01:25:30.226
What are you doing here?

01:25:30.259 --> 01:25:32.228
You called me.

01:25:32.261 --> 01:25:33.429
Where's the man?

01:25:33.462 --> 01:25:35.531
I'm the man.

01:25:37.266 --> 01:25:38.467
I don't get it.

01:25:38.501 --> 01:25:40.203
There's nothing to get.

01:25:40.236 --> 01:25:42.871
Nothing to get? You got out.

01:25:42.905 --> 01:25:44.373
A man's gotta make a living.

01:25:44.407 --> 01:25:46.542
I got kids to feed,
a maid to carry.

01:25:46.575 --> 01:25:48.211
My wife.

01:25:48.244 --> 01:25:49.712
She likes
the finer things in life.

01:25:49.745 --> 01:25:50.913
Let me see 'em.

01:25:52.781 --> 01:25:54.082
Joey? Let me see 'em.

01:25:56.118 --> 01:25:59.222
I don't feel too good about us
doing business like this.

01:25:59.255 --> 01:26:01.757
You don't have
to feel anything.

01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:03.626
You're here to do a deal.

01:26:12.835 --> 01:26:14.670
May I see the money, please?

01:26:14.703 --> 01:26:16.239
Ah, very good.

01:26:16.272 --> 01:26:17.373
You're thinking.

01:26:17.406 --> 01:26:20.376
You must keep
to your plan, never waver.

01:26:25.481 --> 01:26:26.549
Ah?

01:26:26.582 --> 01:26:29.252
Hm, that's

01:26:29.285 --> 01:26:31.487
what it's all about.

01:26:34.156 --> 01:26:36.091
What it's all about.

01:26:42.331 --> 01:26:44.600
Not you, Sammy.

01:26:44.633 --> 01:26:46.034
Joey, where'd you find 'em?

01:26:46.068 --> 01:26:47.703
I went crazy searching.

01:26:48.871 --> 01:26:50.138
Pool filter.

01:26:50.172 --> 01:26:51.840
Ah.

01:26:51.874 --> 01:26:53.476
You used your head.

01:26:53.509 --> 01:26:55.077
You know,

01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:57.045
At first I thought
Mort hiding the drugs

01:26:57.079 --> 01:26:59.515
was a handicap
to my situation.

01:26:59.548 --> 01:27:02.818
But then,
I had a dream.

01:27:02.851 --> 01:27:06.889
I was lost in a great desert.

01:27:06.922 --> 01:27:11.327
I was totally naked
and in great need of water.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:15.398
Then I came upon a mirage,

01:27:15.431 --> 01:27:19.001
and there you were.

01:27:19.034 --> 01:27:20.469
You were a camel.

01:27:21.637 --> 01:27:23.171
How many humps did I have?

01:27:23.205 --> 01:27:25.474
You had two.

01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:31.714
So I climbed upon your back
and I rode you.

01:27:31.747 --> 01:27:36.084
I knew that your instincts
would lead me to water
and you did.

01:27:37.953 --> 01:27:39.722
Thank you, Joey.

01:27:39.755 --> 01:27:42.858
Uh, you're welcome, Sammy.

01:27:42.891 --> 01:27:45.160
But a camel gets awful tired
carrying all that weight.

01:27:45.193 --> 01:27:47.996
God created a man,

01:27:48.030 --> 01:27:50.399
God created a camel.

01:27:50.433 --> 01:27:52.635
One of them's got to do
the shit work.

01:27:54.537 --> 01:27:57.205
I'm sorry, Joey.

01:28:14.222 --> 01:28:16.191
BART:
Joey!

01:28:18.761 --> 01:28:20.596
Joey!

01:28:24.967 --> 01:28:27.370
What the fuck?

01:28:45.354 --> 01:28:47.189
How do you start
this damn thing?

01:28:47.222 --> 01:28:49.257
BART:
Gonna get you!

01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:56.699
Joey, I'm coming up
behind you, Joey.

01:28:56.732 --> 01:28:58.867
I'm on your left side.
I'm on your right side.

01:28:58.901 --> 01:29:00.669
I'm on the left side.

01:29:00.703 --> 01:29:01.737
Oh!

01:29:06.442 --> 01:29:08.577
Oh, you've got me
So excited

01:29:08.611 --> 01:29:10.779
You've got me so excited

01:29:10.813 --> 01:29:13.616
Joey? Joey!

01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:23.526
Yoo-hoo!

01:29:25.494 --> 01:29:26.829
BART:
Joey?

01:29:28.564 --> 01:29:30.098
Joey?

01:29:31.434 --> 01:29:36.304
Joey-poo.
Where are you?

01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:40.242
Joey?

01:29:43.812 --> 01:29:46.114
Oh, Joey.

01:29:46.148 --> 01:29:51.153
Everybody knows Joey Turks
doesn't carry a loaded gun.

01:30:02.565 --> 01:30:03.666
Oh, my God!

01:30:07.335 --> 01:30:09.938
Sweet Jesus. Joey!

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:34.697
Son of a bitch!

01:30:42.638 --> 01:30:44.773
Mort?

01:30:47.743 --> 01:30:50.278
Mort, open up!

01:30:50.312 --> 01:30:53.115
Mort, open up!

01:30:53.148 --> 01:30:54.883
Come on, man!

01:30:54.917 --> 01:30:56.885
I tried calling,
your phone's always busy.

01:30:56.919 --> 01:30:58.954
You ever hear of call waiting?

01:30:58.987 --> 01:31:02.190
Mort! Mort!

01:31:02.224 --> 01:31:04.727
Mort, come on out of there!

01:31:07.530 --> 01:31:10.766
Mort, you're dead.

01:31:10.799 --> 01:31:13.802
Oh, Mort.

01:31:13.836 --> 01:31:15.671
Oh, Mort!

01:31:31.153 --> 01:31:33.488
Mort,
you're holding out on me!

01:31:34.890 --> 01:31:35.958
Ow!

01:31:40.262 --> 01:31:42.565
HANK:
Spuntz, you porker.

01:31:42.598 --> 01:31:44.499
I had this analyzed.

01:31:44.533 --> 01:31:47.435
You paid a million bucks
for a combo

01:31:47.469 --> 01:31:51.006
of caffeine, valium,

01:31:51.039 --> 01:31:53.308
and a mild laxative.

01:32:41.456 --> 01:32:44.092
Love's been around

01:32:47.195 --> 01:32:51.199
Since time began

01:32:56.805 --> 01:33:02.010
Yet I never found the time

01:33:06.715 --> 01:33:09.384
Now since we've met

01:33:13.521 --> 01:33:17.059
I'm a different man

01:33:19.394 --> 01:33:21.864
The time I lost

01:33:21.897 --> 01:33:25.267
I found in you

01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:30.906
I found in you
In time

01:33:44.252 --> 01:33:46.021
Beautiful

01:33:47.823 --> 01:33:49.825
Was the night

01:33:52.027 --> 01:33:54.763
Full moon

01:33:54.797 --> 01:33:57.532
So round and bright

01:34:00.402 --> 01:34:03.338
We're just beginning

01:34:03.371 --> 01:34:05.007
Well, get 'em out of there,
will you?

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:06.775
They're state's evidence.

01:34:06.809 --> 01:34:08.977
Get in the water.

01:34:09.011 --> 01:34:10.913
Yeah.

01:34:10.946 --> 01:34:13.515
Yeah, this is Dick.

01:34:13.548 --> 01:34:15.684
Get me the coroner.

01:34:15.718 --> 01:34:19.922
Beautiful are you

01:34:22.057 --> 01:34:25.861
I guess you know

01:34:25.894 --> 01:34:27.562
Baby, I'm hooked

01:34:27.595 --> 01:34:30.532
Not bad
for three days' work.

01:34:30.565 --> 01:34:33.836
What are we gonna do
with all this?

01:34:33.869 --> 01:34:37.372
Thought we'd find
a nice quiet, safe town.

01:34:39.041 --> 01:34:42.344
That we are teaming
At love

01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:48.784
Holding you

01:34:48.817 --> 01:34:51.386
Kissing you this way

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:55.257
I have

01:34:55.290 --> 01:34:59.962
Only one thing to say

01:34:59.995 --> 01:35:02.197
Beautiful

01:35:02.230 --> 01:35:05.367
Oh, you and me

01:35:07.435 --> 01:35:10.438
Why, our hearts

01:35:10.472 --> 01:35:12.775
They even agree

01:35:16.111 --> 01:35:20.248
We're not pretending

01:35:20.282 --> 01:35:23.485
There is no ending

01:35:23.518 --> 01:35:26.889
Our life we're spending

01:35:26.922 --> 01:35:30.358
Our life we're spending

01:35:30.392 --> 01:35:32.560
Our life

01:35:32.594 --> 01:35:36.731
We're spending at love
