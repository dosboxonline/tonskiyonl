before they got

52:35.653 --> 52:37.195
the jump on you.

52:37.237 --> 52:39.115
So you had places

52:37.237 --> 52:39.115
stashed around the city,

52:39.155 --> 52:40.908
with the mattresses

52:39.155 --> 52:40.908
on the floor.

52:40.950 --> 52:43.452
And that is where

52:40.950 --> 52:43.452
you would make your stand

52:43.494 --> 52:46.330

fell into line,

52:50.459 --> 52:52.377
