00:33.283 --> 00:35.785
Hey, hey, hey, hey

00:49.174 --> 00:53.219
Won't you come see about me?

00:53.303 --> 00:57.974
I'll be alone, dancing
You know it, baby

00:58.183 --> 01:01.978
Tell me your troubles
and doubts

01:02.062 --> 01:06.149
Giving me everything
inside and out and

01:06.900 --> 01:10.778
Love's strange
So real in the dark

01:10.863 --> 01:15.241
Think of the tender things
that we were working on

01:15.701 --> 01:19.912
Slow change may pull us apart

01:20.038 --> 01:24.333
When the light gets
into your heart, baby

01:24.752 --> 01:29.005
Don't you forget about me

01:30.841 --> 01:33.509
Don't, don't, don't, don't

01:33.594 --> 01:37.764
Don't you forget about me

01:41.852 --> 01:46.063
Will you stand above me?

01:46.148 --> 01:50.401
Look my way but never love me

Saturday, March 24, 1984.

Shermer High School,
Shermer, Illinois, 60062.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.394
Dear Mr. Vernon.

02:26.230 --> 02:29.232
We accept the fact
that we had to sacrifice
a whole Saturday in detention

02:29.316 --> 02:31.734
for whatever it was
we did wrong.

02:32.361 --> 02:33.611
What we did was wrong

02:35.155 --> 02:36.906
but we think you're crazy
to make us write an essay

02:36.990 --> 02:38.699
telling you
who we think we are.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.036
What do you care?

02:43.080 --> 02:44.831
You see us
as you want to see us,

02:45.874 --> 02:49.210
in the simplest terms,
with the most convenient
definitions.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.088
You see us as a brain,

02:52.714 --> 02:56.300
an athlete, a basket case,

02:57.427 --> 02:58.427
a princess,

02:59.888 --> 03:01.264
and a criminal.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.141
Correct?

03:07.604 --> 03:10.398
That's the way
we saw each other
at 7:00 this morning.

03:11.233 --> 03:13.109
We were brainwashed.

03:22.411 --> 03:25.288
I can't believe
you can't get me
out of this.

03:27.124 --> 03:30.209
It's so absurd
I have to be here
on a Saturday.

03:32.087 --> 03:34.630
It's not like I'm
a defective or anything.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.340
I'll make it up to you.

03:36.425 --> 03:40.136
Honey,
ditching class to go shopping
doesn't make you a defective.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.888
Have a good day.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.854
Is this the first time
or last time we do this?

03:50.439 --> 03:51.439
Last.

03:51.523 --> 03:54.400
Well, get in there
and use the time
to your advantage.

03:54.484 --> 03:57.320
Mom, we're not supposed
to study. We have to
sit there and do nothing.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.405
Well, mister,
you figure out
a way to study.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.698
Yeah.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.993
Well, go.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.752
Hey, I screwed around.

04:12.836 --> 04:15.671
Guys screw around.
There's nothing
wrong with that,

04:15.756 --> 04:17.882
except you got caught,
sport.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.384
Yeah, Mom already
reamed me, all right?

04:20.469 --> 04:23.846
You want to miss a match?
You want to blow your ride?

04:24.681 --> 04:28.643
Now, no school is gonna
give a scholarship to
a discipline case.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.821
I wanna congratulate you
for being on time.

06:03.905 --> 06:06.991
Excuse me, sir?
I think there's
been a mistake.

06:07.075 --> 06:11.454
I know it's detention,
but I don't think
I belong in here.

06:14.082 --> 06:17.126
It is now 7:06.

06:17.794 --> 06:22.548
You have exactly eight hours
and 54 minutes to think
about why you're here.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.301

06:27.763 --> 06:29.430
You may not talk.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.477
You will not move
from these seats.

06:37.481 --> 06:40.483
And you will not sleep.

06:45.989 --> 06:49.492
All right, people, we're
going to try something
a little different today.

06:49.576 --> 06:55.372
We are going to write an essay
of no less than 1000 words

06:56.750 --> 06:58.959
describing to me
who you think you are.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.127
Is this a test?

07:00.212 --> 07:03.964
And when I say essay,
I mean essay.

07:05.801 --> 07:10.346
I do not mean a single word
repeated 1000 times.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.224
Is that clear, Mr. Bender?

07:13.517 --> 07:14.600
Crystal.

07:14.684 --> 07:18.020
Good. Maybe you'll learn
something about yourself.

07:18.563 --> 07:22.108
Maybe you'll even decide
whether or not
you care to return.

07:24.152 --> 07:27.738
I can answer that
right now, sir. That'd
be "no" for me, 'cause...

07:27.823 --> 07:29.156
Sit down, Johnson.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.574
Thank you, sir.

that hall. Any monkey business
is ill-advised.

Any questions?

JOHN: Yeah. I got a question.

07:44.256 --> 07:47.174
Does Barry Manilow know
that you raid his wardrobe?

07:47.259 --> 07:51.512
I'll give you the answer
to that question,
Mr. Bender, next Saturday.

Don't mess with the bull,
young man,
you'll get the horns.

write our papers.

11:05.915 --> 11:06.874

it wouldn't make
any difference.

You may as well not even exist
at this school.

I'm in a Math Club.

12:57.193 --> 13:01.572
You're afraid that they won't
take you, you don't belong,
so you dump all over it.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.866
Well, it wouldn't
have anything to do

13:03.950 --> 13:07.327

being assholes, would it?

13:07.412 --> 13:10.080

any lepers either,

and join one of their
fucking clubs.

watch the mouth, huh?

What are you babbling about?

I'm in the Math Club,

13:24.471 --> 13:27.723

and the Physics Club.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.894
Hey. Cherry.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.148
Do you belong
to the Physics Club?

That's an academic club.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.152
JOHN: So?

13:41.654 --> 13:45.073
Academic clubs aren't the same
as other kinds of clubs.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.993
But to dorks like him,
they are.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.580
What do you guys do
in your club?

13:51.664 --> 13:56.585
In physics, well,
we talk about physics.
Properties of physics.

13:56.669 --> 14:01.548
So it's sort of social.
Demented and sad,
but social, right?

14:02.258 --> 14:05.385
BRIAN: I guess
you could consider it
a social situation.

14:05.470 --> 14:08.430
I mean, there are
other children in my club.

14:09.933 --> 14:14.269
And at the end of the year,
we have... We have
a big banquet at the Hilton.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.438
You load up. You party.

14:17.315 --> 14:21.151
No. We get dressed up,
but we don't get high.

Only burners
like you get high.

14:22.946 --> 14:25.197
BRIAN:
And I didn't have any shoes,
so I had to borrow my dad's.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.200
It's weird 'cause my mom
doesn't like me to wear
other people's shoes.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.954
My cousin Kent...
My cousin Kendall from
Indiana, he got high once.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.623
And, you know,
he started eating, like,
really weird foods.

14:34.707 --> 14:39.211
Then he felt like he didn't
belong anywhere, kind of like
Twilight Zone, kind of.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.379
Sounds like you.

14:40.463 --> 14:43.131
You guys keep up your talking
and Vernon's gonna come in.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.216
I got a meet this Saturday,

14:44.300 --> 14:46.301
and I'm not gonna miss it
on account of you boneheads.

14:46.386 --> 14:51.098
Oh, and wouldn't that
be a bite? Missing
a whole wrestling meet?

14:51.182 --> 14:53.350
You wouldn't know anything
about it, faggot.

14:53.434 --> 14:54.893
You never competed
in your whole life.

14:54.978 --> 14:57.688
Oh, I know.
I feel all empty inside
because of it.

14:57.772 --> 15:02.651
I have such a deep admiration
for guys who roll around
on the floor with other guys.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.404
You'd never miss it.
You don't have any goals.

15:05.488 --> 15:08.824
Oh, but I do.
I want to be just like you.

15:09.492 --> 15:12.828
I figure all I need's
a lobotomy and some tights.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.499
You wear tights?

15:18.084 --> 15:21.795
No, I don't wear tights.
I wear the required uniform.

Don't screw around.

Bender, that's
school property there,
and it doesn't belong to us.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.308
It's something
not to be toyed with.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.934
That's very funny.
Fix it.

16:18.019 --> 16:19.853
You should really fix that.
Am I a genius?

What a funny guy.

16:21.898 --> 16:22.856
Fix the door, Bender.

16:22.940 --> 16:23.982
Everyone, just...

16:24.067 --> 16:25.484

ANDREW: No. Fix the door!
JOHN: Shut up!

16:28.446 --> 16:29.863

16:33.951 --> 16:35.911
Why is that door closed?

16:39.874 --> 16:41.333
Why is that door closed?

16:41.417 --> 16:44.878
How are we supposed to know?
We're not supposed to move.

16:45.630 --> 16:46.713
Why?

16:48.049 --> 16:50.967
We're just sitting here
like we're supposed to.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.599
Who closed that door?

16:58.643 --> 17:00.394
I think
a screw fell out of it.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.104
It just closed, sir.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.021

17:04.898 --> 17:05.898

I don't have it.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.907
You want me to yank you
out of that seat
and shake it out of you?

17:14.992 --> 17:17.243
I don't have it.
Screws fall out all the time.

17:17.328 --> 17:18.869
The world's
an imperfect place.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.454
Give it to me, Bender.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.709
Excuse me, sir.
Why would anybody
want to steal a screw?

17:23.792 --> 17:25.627

17:35.805 --> 17:37.889

17:52.530 --> 17:56.992
Andrew Clark, get up here.
Come on. Front and center.
Let's go.

17:59.454 --> 18:00.704
Hey, how come
Andrew gets to get up?

18:00.788 --> 18:01.872
That's right.

18:01.956 --> 18:05.751

we'll all get up.
It'll be anarchy!

JOHN: It's out of my hands.

18:14.385 --> 18:18.472
That's very clever, sir,
but what if there's a fire?

18:19.682 --> 18:23.602
I think violating fire codes
and endangering
the lives of children

18:23.686 --> 18:26.354
would be unwise
at this juncture
in your career, sir.

18:26.439 --> 18:30.609
All right. What are you
doing with this? Get this
out of here, for God's sake.

18:30.693 --> 18:31.943
What's the matter with you?
Come on!

18:32.028 --> 18:35.655
You know, the school
comes equipped with fire exits
at either end of the library.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.200
Show Dick some respect.
Let's go.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.203
Go. Get back in your seat.

18:44.207 --> 18:47.417
I expected a little more
from a varsity letterman.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.297
You're not fooling anybody,
Bender.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.550
The next screw that falls out
is gonna be you.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.678
Eat my shorts.
What was that?

19:01.390 --> 19:04.893
Eat my shorts.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.354
You just bought yourself
another Saturday, mister.

19:07.438 --> 19:08.772
Oh, I'm crushed.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.023
You just bought
one more right there.

19:10.107 --> 19:13.652
Well, I'm free the Saturday
after that. Beyond that, I'll
have to check my calendar.

19:13.736 --> 19:17.113
Good! Because it's gonna
be filled. We'll keep going.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.826
You want another one?
Say the word.
Just say the word.

19:20.910 --> 19:23.912
Instead of going to prison,
you'll come here.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.832
Are you through?
No.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.792
I'm doing society a favor.
So?

19:28.876 --> 19:30.210
That's another right now.

I've got you
for the rest of your life
if you don't watch your step.

You want another one?

19:34.757 --> 19:35.799
Yes.

19:35.883 --> 19:39.135
You got it! You got
another one right there.
That's another one, pal.

19:39.220 --> 19:42.180
Cut it out! Stop.

19:43.558 --> 19:46.017
Not even close, bud.

You got one more right there.

I give a shit?

19:54.485 --> 19:55.861
How many is that?

19:55.945 --> 19:58.864
That's seven,
including the one when
you asked Mr. Vernon here

19:58.948 --> 20:00.824
whether Barry Manilow knew
he raided his closet.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.534
Now it's eight.
Stay out of it.

20:02.618 --> 20:03.785
Excuse me, sir. It's seven.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.453
Shut up, peewee.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.752
You're mine, Bender.
For two months, I got you.

20:14.297 --> 20:15.547
I got you.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.092
What can I say? I'm thrilled.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.761
Oh, I'm sure that's exactly
what you want these people
to believe.

20:21.846 --> 20:23.513
You know something?

20:23.598 --> 20:26.600
You ought to spend
a little more time trying to
do something with yourself

20:26.684 --> 20:29.728
and a little less time
trying to impress people.

20:29.812 --> 20:33.523

23:14.977 --> 23:16.311
You're right.

said I was. My dad told me
just to blow her off.

'Cause if I do what
my mother tells me not to do,

choose between them.

think either one of them
gives a shit about me.

to get back at each other.

maximum density.

and there's fat people
that were once thin,
but they became fat.

you can sort of see
that thin person inside.

32:27.571 --> 32:29.322
Here?
Here.

32:29.865 --> 32:33.576
I think the cafeteria would be
a more suitable place
for us to eat lunch in.

32:33.660 --> 32:36.454
I don't care
what you think, Andrew.

32:36.538 --> 32:37.705
JOHN: Dick?

32:38.165 --> 32:42.126
Excuse me, Rich.
Will milk be made
available to us?

32:42.210 --> 32:43.961
We're extremely
thirsty, sir.

32:44.046 --> 32:46.631
I have
a really low tolerance
for dehydration.

32:46.715 --> 32:49.759
I've seen her
dehydrated, sir.
It's pretty gross.

32:49.843 --> 32:51.552
Relax. I'll get it.

32:56.391 --> 32:59.101
What, do you think
I was born yesterday?

32:59.728 --> 33:03.064
You think
I'm going to have you
roaming these halls?

33:04.274 --> 33:05.316
You.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.949
And you. Hey!

33:15.535 --> 33:17.328
What's her name?
Wake her up.

33:17.412 --> 33:21.457
Hey, come on. On your feet,
missy. Let's go!
This is no rest home.

33:23.418 --> 33:27.338
There's a soft drink machine
in the teachers' lounge.
Let's go.

33:32.386 --> 33:35.221
So what's your poison?

33:38.225 --> 33:39.892
What do you drink?

33:42.354 --> 33:44.146
Okay. Forget I asked.

33:46.650 --> 33:47.858
Vodka.

33:49.945 --> 33:53.030
Vodka? When do you
drink vodka?

33:53.824 --> 33:55.116
Whenever.

33:56.702 --> 33:57.785
A lot?

33:57.869 --> 33:59.078
Tons.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.289
Is that why you're
here today?

34:03.041 --> 34:05.543
Why are you here?
Why are you here?

34:13.135 --> 34:15.010
I'm here today because...

34:16.888 --> 34:20.683
Because my coach and my father
don't want me to blow my ride.

34:21.643 --> 34:25.396
I get treated differently
because coach thinks
I'm a winner.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.565
So does my old man.

34:27.983 --> 34:30.317
I'm not a winner
because I want to be one.

34:30.402 --> 34:34.405
I'm a winner because I got
strength and speed,
kind of like a racehorse.

34:35.824 --> 34:38.617
That's about how involved I am
in what's happening to me.

34:38.702 --> 34:39.827
Yeah?

34:41.163 --> 34:43.164
That's very interesting.

34:46.710 --> 34:50.045
Now why don't you tell me
why you're really in here.

34:50.964 --> 34:52.297
Forget it.

34:58.930 --> 35:03.392
Claire? Want to see a picture
of a guy with elephantiasis
of the nuts?

35:03.477 --> 35:05.436
It's pretty tasty.
No, thank you.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.938
How do you think
he rides a bike?

35:11.026 --> 35:14.695
Claire? Would you consider
dating a guy like this?

35:15.280 --> 35:18.199
Can't you just leave me alone?
I mean, if he had
a great personality,

35:18.283 --> 35:20.951
was a good dancer
and had a cool car?

35:21.036 --> 35:25.873
You'd probably have to ride
in the backseat because
his nuts would ride shotgun.

35:27.375 --> 35:28.709
You know what I
wish I was doing?

35:28.794 --> 35:31.587
Watch what you say.
Brian here is a cherry.

35:31.755 --> 35:33.005
A cherry?

35:33.089 --> 35:36.133
I wish I was
in a plane to France.

35:36.259 --> 35:37.551
I'm not a cherry.

35:37.636 --> 35:38.969
When have you
ever gotten laid?

35:39.054 --> 35:41.305
I've laid lots of times.

35:41.556 --> 35:43.015
Name one.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.476
She lives in Canada.

35:45.560 --> 35:48.896
I met her at Niagara Falls.
You wouldn't know her.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.232
Ever laid anyone around here?

35:52.651 --> 35:55.736
Oh. You and Claire did it?

35:56.822 --> 35:59.573
What are you talking about?
Nothing. Nothing.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.283
Let's just drop it, okay?
We'll talk about it later.

36:01.368 --> 36:02.576
What are you talking about?

36:02.661 --> 36:03.911
Brian's trying to tell me

36:03.995 --> 36:07.373
that in addition
to the number of girls
in the Niagara Falls area,

36:07.457 --> 36:10.876
that presently you and he
are riding the hobby horse.

36:11.211 --> 36:13.337
Little pig.
No, I'm not.

36:13.922 --> 36:17.383
John said I was a cherry,
and I said I wasn't.
That's all that was said.

36:17.467 --> 36:19.927
Then what were you
motioning to Claire for?

36:20.011 --> 36:21.971
I don't appreciate this
very much, Brian.

36:22.055 --> 36:23.180
He is lying.

36:23.265 --> 36:25.599
You weren't
motioning to Claire?

36:26.726 --> 36:27.852
You know he's lying, right?

36:27.936 --> 36:30.729
JOHN: Were you or were you not
motioning to Claire?

36:31.648 --> 36:33.607
Yeah, but it was only...

36:34.818 --> 36:38.445
It was only because
I didn't want her to
know I was a virgin.

36:39.072 --> 36:41.949
Excuse me for being
a virgin. I'm sorry.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.201
Why didn't you want me to know
you were a virgin?

36:44.286 --> 36:47.454
Because it's personal
business. It's my personal,
private business.

36:47.539 --> 36:50.624
Well, Brian, it doesn't
sound like you're doing
any business.

36:50.709 --> 36:53.627
I think it's okay
for a guy to be a virgin.

36:54.296 --> 36:55.504
You do?

37:06.933 --> 37:08.309
What's in there?

37:08.393 --> 37:10.978
Guess. Where's your lunch?

37:12.230 --> 37:13.689
You're wearing it.

37:14.316 --> 37:15.941
You're nauseating.

37:30.832 --> 37:32.333
What's that?

37:32.918 --> 37:34.168
Sushi.

37:35.295 --> 37:36.295
Sushi?

37:36.379 --> 37:40.507
Rice, raw fish
and seaweed.

37:43.845 --> 37:47.014
You won't accept
a guy's tongue in your mouth,
and you're gonna eat that?

37:47.098 --> 37:48.390
Can I eat?

37:49.768 --> 37:52.019

48:59.729 --> 49:01.646
What if your dope was on fire?

49:01.731 --> 49:05.525
Impossible, sir.
It's in Johnson's underwear.

49:06.527 --> 49:08.236
You think he's funny?

49:08.321 --> 49:12.115
You think this is cute?
You think he's bitching?
Is that it?

49:12.199 --> 49:15.452
Let me tell you something.
Look at him.

49:16.954 --> 49:18.955
He's a bum.

49:19.040 --> 49:22.876
You want to see something
funny? You go visit
John Bender in five years.

49:22.960 --> 49:25.503
You'll see how
goddamn funny he is.

49:32.762 --> 49:35.597
What's the matter, John?
You going to cry?

49:38.726 --> 49:41.686
Let's go.
Keep your
fucking hands off me!

49:43.022 --> 49:46.024
I expect better manners
from you, Dick.

49:48.069 --> 49:50.070
For better hallway vision.

50:01.999 --> 50:03.166
That's the last time, Bender.

50:03.250 --> 50:05.669
That's the last time you
ever make me look bad
in front of those kids.

50:05.753 --> 50:06.836
Do you hear me?

50:06.921 --> 50:09.339
I make $31,000 a year,
and I've got a home.

50:09.423 --> 50:12.300
And I'm not about to
throw it away
on some punk like you.

50:12.385 --> 50:14.969
But someday, man,
someday when you're
out of here,

50:15.054 --> 50:18.014
and you've forgotten all
about this place, and they've
forgotten about you,

50:18.099 --> 50:20.975
and you're wrapped up
in your own pathetic life

50:21.060 --> 50:22.936
I'm gonna be there.

50:24.313 --> 50:27.691
That's right. And I'm gonna
kick the living shit
out of you, man.

50:27.775 --> 50:30.443
I'm gonna knock your
dick in the dirt.

50:33.155 --> 50:34.906
You threatening me?

50:35.199 --> 50:37.450
What are you
going to do about it?

50:39.286 --> 50:41.955
You think anybody's
gonna believe you?

50:43.290 --> 50:46.626
You think anybody
is gonna take your
word over mine?

50:47.753 --> 50:50.130
I'm a man of respect
around here.
They love me around here.

50:50.214 --> 50:55.135
I'm a swell guy.
You're a lying sack of shit,
and everybody knows it.

50:57.346 --> 51:00.849
You're a real tough guy.
Hey, hey. Come on.

51:00.933 --> 51:04.144
Get on your feet, pal!
Let's find out
how tough you are.

51:04.228 --> 51:06.980
I wanna know, right now,
how tough you are. Come on.

51:07.064 --> 51:10.442
I'll give you the first punch.
Let's go. Come on. Right here.

51:10.526 --> 51:14.612
Just take the first shot.
Please. I'm begging you.
Take a shot. Right here.

51:14.822 --> 51:18.283
Just take one shot.
That's all I need.
Just one swing.

51:28.043 --> 51:30.003
That's what I thought.

51:31.756 --> 51:33.882
You're a gutless turd.

What was that ruckus?

53:00.970 --> 53:02.303
What ruckus?

53:02.388 --> 53:04.931
I was in my office,
and I heard a ruckus.

53:05.474 --> 53:07.183
Could you describe
the ruckus, sir.

you were talking about?

53:35.087 --> 53:38.840
No, it wasn't.
That was not the noise
I was talking about.

53:38.924 --> 53:43.720
Now, I may not have caught you
in the act this time,
but you can bet I will.

53:48.559 --> 53:52.645
And you! I will not
be made a fool of.

54:08.996 --> 54:10.371
It was an accident.

54:10.456 --> 54:12.540
You're an asshole.

54:13.334 --> 54:15.084

Good. What's up?
Not much.

58:20.914 --> 58:22.999
What's happening?
What are you doing
in the basement files?

58:23.083 --> 58:25.376
Oh, nothing. Nothing here.
Just doing a little homework.

Homework, huh?
Yeah.

Confidential files, huh?

Look, Carl. This is
a highly sensitive area,
and I tell you something.

58:37.181 --> 58:39.849
Certain people would be very,
very embarrassed.

58:39.933 --> 58:42.602
I would really appreciate it
if this would be something

58:42.686 --> 58:45.938

keep between us.

Would you mind telling me
how you know all this

01:00:07.396 --> 01:00:08.854
What about the others?

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:13.442
Well, some
I consider my girlfriends,
and some I just consider.

01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:15.361
Consider what?

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:18.114

wanna hang out with them.

How come you have
so many girlfriends?

I asked you first.

01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:39.885
I don't know.
I guess I never
threw anything away.

So I can vote.

01:00:58.238 --> 01:01:00.489

what's in my bag?

you may have to jam.

Are you gonna be,
like, a shopping bag lady?

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:41.238
You know, like,
sit in alleyways

01:01:41.323 --> 01:01:44.533
and talk to buildings
and wear men's shoes
and that kind of thing?

01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:46.702
I'll do what I have to do.

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:49.747
Why do you have to
do anything?

01:01:50.582 --> 01:01:55.628

subject yourself to
the violent dangers

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:03.219
of these Chicago streets
because your home life
is unsatisfying?

01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:05.012
I don't have to run away
and live in the street.

01:02:05.097 --> 01:02:07.431
I can run away
and I can go to the ocean.

01:02:07.516 --> 01:02:09.225
I can go to the country.
I can go to the mountains.

01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:12.645
I could go to Israel,
Africa, Afghanistan.

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:23.823
Andy, wanna get in on this?

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:30.538
Allison here says she wants to
run away because her home life
is unsatisfying.

01:02:32.874 --> 01:02:35.793
Well, everyone's
home life is unsatisfying.

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:39.672
And if it wasn't,
people would live with
their parents forever.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:43.008
Yeah, yeah, I understand,
but I think hers goes beyond

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:48.097
what, you know,
guys like you and me
consider normal unsatisfying.

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:51.183
Never mind. Forget it.
Everything's cool.

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:53.853
What's the deal?
No.

01:02:54.354 --> 01:02:56.814
There's no deal, sporto.

01:02:56.898 --> 01:02:58.399
Forget it. Leave me alone.

01:02:58.483 --> 01:02:59.567

You're carrying all that
crap around in your purse.

01:03:02.696 --> 01:03:04.321
Either you really
wanna run away,

01:03:04.406 --> 01:03:06.949
or you want people to think
you wanna run away.

You wanna talk?
No.

01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:31.390
Why not?

01:03:32.225 --> 01:03:34.268
Go away.

01:03:34.603 --> 01:03:35.686
Where do you want me to go?

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:37.354
Go away!

01:03:49.618 --> 01:03:50.993

You do everything everybody
ever tells you to do.
That is a problem.

01:03:54.247 --> 01:03:56.957
Okay, fine. But I didn't dump
my purse out on the couch

01:03:57.042 --> 01:04:01.587
and invite people into
my problems, did I?

01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:08.886
So what's wrong?

01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:11.931

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:39.667

What do they do to you?

01:04:53.932 --> 01:04:55.891
They ignore me.

01:04:58.353 --> 01:04:59.520

01:05:02.983 --> 01:05:04.149
Yeah.

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:10.906
What did you wanna be
when you were young?

I wanted to be John Lennon.

Carl, don't be a goof.

a serious point here.

Carl, I've been
teaching for 22 years.

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:30.009
And each year,
these kids get more
and more arrogant.

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:33.095
Oh, bullshit, man.
Come on, Vern.

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:35.055

you have.

be fun, right?

01:05:41.354 --> 01:05:44.106
Thought you could have
summer vacations off.

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:46.358
And then you found out
it was actually work.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:48.569
That really bummed you out.

01:05:50.614 --> 01:05:52.656
These kids turned on me.

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:57.578
They think I'm
a big fucking joke.

01:05:57.662 --> 01:05:58.996
Come on.

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:03.751
Listen, Vern. If you were 16,
what would you think of you?

01:06:03.835 --> 01:06:08.631
Hey, Carl,
you think I give one rat's ass
what these kids think of me?

01:06:08.715 --> 01:06:10.341
Yes, I do.

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:15.220
You think about this.
When you get old,
these kids...

01:06:15.305 --> 01:06:18.766
When I get old,
they're gonna be
running the country.

01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:21.018
Yeah.

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:25.022
Now this is the thought
that wakes me up
in the middle of the night.

01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:29.276
When I get older,
these kids are gonna
take care of me.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.237
I wouldn't count on it.

01:06:36.117 --> 01:06:38.744
What would I do
for a million bucks?

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:42.414
I guess I'd do
as little as I had to.

01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:43.540
That's boring.

01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:45.376
Well, how am I
supposed to answer?

01:06:45.794 --> 01:06:49.171
The idea is to, like,
search your mind
for the absolute limit.

01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:54.009
Like, would you
drive to school naked?

01:06:58.807 --> 01:07:00.516
Would I have to
get out of the car?

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.767
Of course.

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:03.811
ANDREW:
In the spring or winter?

01:07:03.895 --> 01:07:05.979
CLAIRE:
Doesn't matter. Spring.

01:07:06.064 --> 01:07:08.482
In front of the school
or in back of the school?

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:09.692
Either one.

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:11.235
Yes.

01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:13.487
I'd do that.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:18.701
I'll do anything sexual.
I don't need a million dollars
to do it, either.

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:19.910
You're lying.

01:07:19.994 --> 01:07:21.745
ALLISON: I already have.

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:26.792
I've done just about
everything there is, except
a few things that are illegal.

01:07:27.001 --> 01:07:28.919
I'm a nymphomaniac.

01:07:29.629 --> 01:07:31.338
Lie.

01:07:31.923 --> 01:07:33.924
Are your parents
aware of this?

01:07:34.134 --> 01:07:36.427
The only person
I told was my shrink.

01:07:36.845 --> 01:07:38.846
What did he do
when you told him?

01:07:39.139 --> 01:07:41.014
He nailed me.

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:46.145
Very nice.

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:48.605
I don't think that
from a legal standpoint

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:52.109
what he did can be construed
as rape since I paid him.

01:07:52.193 --> 01:07:53.277
He's an adult.

01:07:53.361 --> 01:07:55.779
Yeah. He's married, too.

01:07:55.864 --> 01:07:57.531
(GROANS IN DISGUST)

01:07:57.615 --> 01:08:00.242
Do you have any idea
how completely
gross that is?

01:08:00.326 --> 01:08:03.370
Well, the first few times...
The first few times?

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:05.831
You mean,
he did it more than once?
Sure.

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:07.249
Are you crazy?

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:10.627
Obviously she's crazy
if she's screwing her shrink.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.839
Have you ever done it?

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:18.260
I don't even have
a psychiatrist.

01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:20.929
Have you ever done it
with a normal person?

01:08:21.014 --> 01:08:22.346
Didn't we already cover this?

01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:25.017
You never
answered the question.

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:29.438
Look. I'm not going to
discuss my private life
with total strangers.

01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:31.273
It's kind of
a double-edged sword,
isn't it?

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:32.441
A what?

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:36.111
If you say you haven't,
you're a prude.

01:08:36.196 --> 01:08:40.282
If you say you have,
you're a slut. It's a trap.

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:42.201
You want to,
but you can't.

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:44.787
And when you do,
you wish you didn't, right?

01:08:44.871 --> 01:08:45.828
Wrong.

01:08:45.913 --> 01:08:48.791
Or are you a tease?

01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:51.210
She's a tease.

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:52.795
I'm sure.
Why don't you forget it?

01:08:52.879 --> 01:08:55.421
You're a tease
and you know it.
All girls are teases.

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:57.716
She's only a tease
if what she does
gets you hot.

01:08:57.801 --> 01:08:59.218
I don't do anything!

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.595
That's why you're a tease.

01:09:02.095 --> 01:09:04.139
Okay, let me ask you
a few questions.

01:09:04.224 --> 01:09:05.974
I already told you everything.
No.

01:09:06.059 --> 01:09:08.227
Doesn't it bother you
to sleep around
without being in love?

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:09.603
Don't you want respect?

01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:12.147
I don't screw to get respect.

01:09:12.232 --> 01:09:14.649
That's the difference
between you and me.

01:09:14.734 --> 01:09:16.276
It's not the only difference
I hope.

01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:17.778
JOHN: Face it,
you're a tease.

01:09:17.862 --> 01:09:18.946
I'm not a tease.

01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:21.198
Sure you are.
Sex is your weapon.

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:24.408
You said it yourself.
You use it to get respect.

01:09:25.245 --> 01:09:28.162
No, I never said that.
She twisted my words around.

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:29.497
What do you
use it for, then?

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:31.582
I don't use it, period!

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:34.795
Are you medically frigid
or is it psychological?

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:37.923
I didn't mean it that way.
You guys are putting words
into my mouth.

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:39.716
Well, if you'd just
answer the question.

01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:41.093
BRIAN: Why don't you just
answer the question?

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:43.011
Be honest. No big deal.
Yeah, answer it.

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:45.264
Just answer the question,
Claire.
Talk to us.

01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:47.432
Answer the question!
Answer the question!

01:09:47.559 --> 01:09:49.685
Don't be a jerk!
It's easy.
It's only one question.

01:09:49.769 --> 01:09:52.563
No, I never did it!

01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:59.111
I never did it, either.

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:05.450
I'm not a nymphomaniac.
I'm a compulsive liar.

01:10:06.911 --> 01:10:09.663
You are such a bitch!

01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:12.416
You did that on purpose
just to fuck me over!

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:16.295
I would do it, though.
If you love someone,
it's okay.

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:19.131
I can't believe you.
You're so weird.

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:22.509
You don't say anything
all day, and then when
you open your mouth

01:10:22.594 --> 01:10:24.928
you unload all these
tremendous lies all over me.

01:10:25.013 --> 01:10:26.597
You're just pissed off
because she got you

01:10:26.681 --> 01:10:29.016
to admit something
you didn't
want to admit to.

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:31.351
Okay, fine.
But that doesn't make it
any less bizarre.

01:10:31.436 --> 01:10:35.314
What's bizarre? I mean,
we're all pretty bizarre.

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:38.942
Some of us are just better
at hiding it, that's all.

01:10:39.027 --> 01:10:40.903
How are you bizarre?

01:10:42.989 --> 01:10:45.157
He can't think for himself.

01:10:46.367 --> 01:10:47.826
She's right.

01:10:48.995 --> 01:10:52.456
Do you guys know
what I did to get in here?

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:57.085
I taped Larry Lester's
buns together.

01:10:58.046 --> 01:10:59.630
That was you?

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:01.673
Yeah. You know him?

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:03.175
Yeah, I know him.

01:11:04.177 --> 01:11:06.595
Then you know
how hairy he is, right?

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:13.352
When they pulled the tape off,
most of his hair came off
and some skin, too.

01:11:13.895 --> 01:11:15.604
Oh, my God.

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:20.525
The bizarre thing is,
is that I did it
for my old man.

01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:25.656
I tortured this poor kid

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:28.784
because I wanted him to think
that I was cool.

01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:34.873
He's always going off about,
you know,
when he was in school.

01:11:35.667 --> 01:11:38.126
All the wild things
he used to do.

01:11:39.253 --> 01:11:42.255
And I got the feeling
that he was disappointed

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:45.092
that I never cut loose
on anyone, right.

01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:53.350
So, I'm sitting
in the locker room
and I'm taping up my knee.

01:11:55.770 --> 01:12:00.065
And Larry's undressing
a couple lockers down from me.

01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:08.115
And he's kind of...
He's kind of skinny.
He's weak.

01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:16.665
And I started thinking about
my father and his attitude
about weakness.

01:12:18.584 --> 01:12:20.669
And the next thing I knew

01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:26.174
I jumped on top of him
and started wailing on him.

01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:31.888
And my friends,
they just laughed
and cheered me on.

01:12:35.018 --> 01:12:36.560
And afterwards,

01:12:38.813 --> 01:12:41.898
when I was sitting
in Vernon's office,

01:12:44.318 --> 01:12:46.278
all I could think about

01:12:47.613 --> 01:12:49.322
was Larry's father

01:12:51.159 --> 01:12:53.660
and Larry having to go home

01:12:55.329 --> 01:12:58.749
and explain what
happened to him.

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:05.422
And the humiliation.

01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:10.469
Fucking humiliation
he must have felt.

01:13:13.806 --> 01:13:15.932
It must have been unreal.

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:22.355
I mean, how do you apologize
for something like that?

01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:27.861
There's no way.

01:13:32.533 --> 01:13:35.202
It's all because of me
and my old man.

01:13:39.373 --> 01:13:41.416
God, I fucking hate him.

01:13:43.836 --> 01:13:45.253
He's like this...

01:13:45.338 --> 01:13:49.549
He's like this mindless
machine that I can't even
relate to anymore.

01:13:50.384 --> 01:13:54.346
"Andrew! You've
got to be number one!

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.350
"I won't tolerate any losers
in this family.

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:03.438
"Your intensity is for shit!
Win! Win! Win!"

01:14:04.649 --> 01:14:06.775
You son of a bitch.

01:14:10.029 --> 01:14:13.532
You know, sometimes
I wish my knee would give,

01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:17.160
then I wouldn't be able
to wrestle anymore.

01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:20.872
Then he could
forget all about me.

01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:26.419
I think your old man
and my old man should
get together and go bowling.

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:34.427
It's like me, you know,
with my grades.

01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:37.347
Like when I...
When I step outside myself

01:14:37.431 --> 01:14:40.725
and like when I look in
at myself, you know.

01:14:43.938 --> 01:14:46.106
And I... And I see me.

01:14:49.527 --> 01:14:51.528
I don't like what I see.

01:14:52.947 --> 01:14:54.531
I really don't.

01:14:55.074 --> 01:14:58.827
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you like yourself?

01:14:59.954 --> 01:15:02.038
Sounds stupid, but,

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:08.295
because I'm failing shop.

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:14.050
We had this assignment,
you know, to make this,
like, ceramic elephant

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:16.803
and we had
eight weeks to do it.

01:15:16.888 --> 01:15:20.390
And then, you know,
we're supposed to...
It was, like, a lamp.

01:15:20.474 --> 01:15:25.437
And when, you know, when you
pull it, the trunk, the light
was supposed to go on.

01:15:26.272 --> 01:15:28.773
But my light didn't go on.

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:31.902
I got an F on it.

01:15:33.321 --> 01:15:35.614
I've never got an F
in my life.

01:15:36.282 --> 01:15:39.451
When I signed up, you know,
for the course, I mean,

01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:41.244
I thought I was playing it
real smart, you know,

01:15:41.329 --> 01:15:43.038
'cause I thought,
you know, I'll take shop.

01:15:43.122 --> 01:15:45.957
It'll be such an easy way
to maintain my
grade point average.

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:48.293
Why'd you think it'd be easy?

01:15:50.421 --> 01:15:52.130
Have you seen some
of the dopes that take shop?

01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:56.551
I take shop.
You must be a fucking idiot.

01:15:56.636 --> 01:15:58.220
I'm a fucking idiot
because I can't make a lamp?

01:15:58.304 --> 01:16:01.514
No, you're a genius
because you can't make a lamp.

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:03.600
What do you know
about trigonometry?

01:16:03.684 --> 01:16:05.894
I could care less
about trigonometry.

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:08.396
Bender, did you know
without trigonometry,
there'd be no engineering?

01:16:08.481 --> 01:16:10.273
Without lamps,
there'd be no light.

01:16:10.358 --> 01:16:14.110
Okay, so neither one of you
is any better than
the other one.

01:16:14.195 --> 01:16:16.363
I can write with my toes.

01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:19.908
I can also eat,
brush my teeth.

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:21.326
With your feet?

01:16:22.787 --> 01:16:24.287
Play Heart And Soul
on the piano.

01:16:24.372 --> 01:16:26.373
I can make spaghetti.

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:28.959

You're there
with all the sports.

You'd say hi to him,

you'd cut him all up

you were doing it with me

01:29:03.422 --> 01:29:06.007
Don't stick that in my eye.
I'm not sticking...

01:29:06.091 --> 01:29:09.760
Just close it. No, wait, wait.
Just go like... Go like that.

01:29:10.345 --> 01:29:11.721
Good.

01:29:11.805 --> 01:29:13.889
(WHIMPERING)

01:29:15.475 --> 01:29:18.519
You know, you really do
look better without all that
black shit on your eyes.

01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:21.856
Hey, I like that
black shit.

01:29:22.441 --> 01:29:24.608
CLAIRE:
This looks a lot better.

01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:26.193
Look up.

01:29:32.784 --> 01:29:33.951
(SNORTING)

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:38.539
Please. Why are you
being so nice to me?

01:29:40.125 --> 01:29:42.168
'Cause you're letting me.

01:29:58.852 --> 01:30:00.352
You lost?

01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:54.198
Thank you.

01:31:02.207 --> 01:31:03.874
Why'd you do that?

01:31:04.292 --> 01:31:06.210
'Cause I knew you wouldn't.

01:31:07.921 --> 01:31:11.924
You know how you said before
how your parents use you
to get back at each other?

01:31:12.008 --> 01:31:14.927
Wouldn't I be outstanding
in that capacity?

01:31:17.764 --> 01:31:21.225
Were you really
disgusted about what
I did with my lipstick?

01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:22.852
Truth?

01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:24.895
Truth.

01:31:25.522 --> 01:31:26.647
No.

01:31:37.033 --> 01:31:39.326
What happened to you?

01:31:39.995 --> 01:31:42.204
Why? Claire did it.

01:31:47.335 --> 01:31:48.711
What's wrong?

01:31:49.171 --> 01:31:50.171
Nothing's wrong.

01:31:50.255 --> 01:31:54.592
It's just... You're just
so different, you know.

01:31:56.428 --> 01:31:58.053
I can see your face.

01:31:59.097 --> 01:32:00.806
Is that good or bad?

01:32:02.058 --> 01:32:04.643
That's good.

01:32:19.201 --> 01:32:21.410
See you, Brian.
Hey, Carl.

01:32:22.787 --> 01:32:23.871
See you next Saturday.

01:32:23.955 --> 01:32:25.414
You bet.

01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:30.211
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

01:32:34.591 --> 01:32:37.927
Won't you come see about me?

01:32:38.511 --> 01:32:43.349
I'll be alone, dancing
You know it, baby

01:32:43.433 --> 01:32:47.269
Tell me your troubles
and doubts

01:32:47.354 --> 01:32:52.066
Giving me everything
inside and out and

01:32:52.150 --> 01:32:56.070
Love's strange
So real in the dark

01:32:56.154 --> 01:33:00.908
Think of the tender things
that we were working on

01:33:00.992 --> 01:33:04.995
Slow change may pull us apart

01:33:05.288 --> 01:33:09.917
When the light gets
into your heart, baby

01:33:10.001 --> 01:33:14.505
Don't you forget about me

01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:18.759
Don't, don't, don't, don't

01:33:18.843 --> 01:33:23.639
Don't you forget about me

01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:31.355
Will you stand above me?

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:35.901
Look my way but never love me

01:33:35.986 --> 01:33:40.614
Rain keeps falling
Rain keeps falling

01:33:40.699 --> 01:33:44.243
Down, down, down

01:33:44.828 --> 01:33:49.039
Will you recognize me?

01:33:49.124 --> 01:33:52.918
Call my name or walk on by

01:33:53.003 --> 01:33:58.007
As the rain keeps falling
Rain keeps falling

01:33:58.091 --> 01:34:03.053
Down, down, down

01:34:04.597 --> 01:34:07.391
Hey, hey, hey, hey

01:34:10.687 --> 01:34:12.146
BRIAN: Dear Mr. Vernon.

01:34:13.732 --> 01:34:16.692
We accept the fact
that we had to sacrifice
a whole Saturday in detention

01:34:16.776 --> 01:34:18.986
for whatever it was
we did wrong

01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:20.988
but we think you're crazy
to make us write an essay

01:34:21.072 --> 01:34:23.073
telling you
who we think we are.

01:34:23.158 --> 01:34:25.451
You see us
as you want to see us,

01:34:25.535 --> 01:34:29.455
in the simplest terms,
with the most convenient
definitions.

01:34:29.539 --> 01:34:33.834
But what we found out
is that each one of us
is a brain.

01:34:33.918 --> 01:34:35.502
ANDREW: And an athlete.

01:34:35.587 --> 01:34:37.671
ALLISON: And a basket case.

01:34:37.756 --> 01:34:38.964
CLAIRE: A princess.

01:34:39.049 --> 01:34:40.799
JOHN: And a criminal.

01:34:40.884 --> 01:34:43.844
BRIAN: Does that
answer your question?

01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:47.264
Sincerely yours,
The Breakfast Club.

01:34:48.892 --> 01:34:51.518
Don't, don't, don't, don't

01:34:51.603 --> 01:34:55.731
Don't you forget about me

01:34:55.732 --> 01:34:56.690
Don't you forget about me

01:34:58.318 --> 01:35:01.028
As you walk on by

01:35:02.572 --> 01:35:06.867
Will you call my name?

01:35:06.951 --> 01:35:10.704
As you walk on by

01:35:11.247 --> 01:35:15.542
Will you call my name?

01:35:15.627 --> 01:35:18.921
When you walk away

01:35:19.547 --> 01:35:23.300
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

01:35:39.734 --> 01:35:42.778
When you walked into the room

01:35:43.363 --> 01:35:46.323
I could see you were no fool

01:35:46.825 --> 01:35:50.077
Is that smile a sign for me?

01:35:51.162 --> 01:35:53.497
Only if my heart could see

01:36:01.172 --> 01:36:04.216
Will I make your body cry?

01:36:04.509 --> 01:36:07.845
Cry so loud you'd never hear

01:36:08.304 --> 01:36:11.390
In the shadows of my life

01:36:12.517 --> 01:36:14.935
Can I take you home tonight?

01:36:22.777 --> 01:36:26.363
Is your heart too hot to hold?

01:36:26.448 --> 01:36:29.867
Just a flame that
burns my soul

01:36:30.452 --> 01:36:32.953
Heart too hot to hold

01:36:33.037 --> 01:36:37.541
Too hot, too hot,
too hot to hold

01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:40.627
Heart too hot to hold

01:36:40.712 --> 01:36:44.214
Just a flame that
burns my soul

01:36:44.674 --> 01:36:46.884
Heart too hot to hold

01:36:46.968 --> 01:36:51.513
Too hot, too hot,
too hot to hold
