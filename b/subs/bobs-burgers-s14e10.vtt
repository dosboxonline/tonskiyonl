00:28.946 --> 00:30.237
Mine are better than tina's.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.114
Mine kind of smell like soup,
so I'm good.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.950
Okay then, I'm gonna do it.
You know the drill.

00:35.119 --> 00:36.910
Nothing else on

00:36.996 --> 00:38.537

Lin? Linda?

00:47.673 --> 00:50.215
Did you say you're starting
a wash? I hope not

00:50.342 --> 00:52.009
-'cause I'm making toast.
-I couldn't hear you.

Good for you. I'm proud of you.

01:02.063 --> 01:03.937

-No! No!

01:04.065 --> 01:06.273
Off tv bad!

01:06.317 --> 01:08.233
The whole subpanel's fried.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.235
This wiring is a disaster.

01:10.279 --> 01:11.779
None of this is up to code.

01:11.864 --> 01:13.238
You're lucky
just the panel blew.

01:13.324 --> 01:15.240
Your whole house could have
been a christmas roast.

01:15.326 --> 01:16.909
-Aw.
-Not in a good way.

01:16.994 --> 01:18.744
Ah.
-Ah, well, uh,
as the landlord here,

01:18.788 --> 01:21.538
I should tell you
that this all feels very judgy.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.791
What's "code," really?
Just a way to be judgy.

01:23.834 --> 01:26.794
-Who did this work?
-Well, uh, this was
a collaboration

01:26.837 --> 01:29.546
Over the years with... Involving
many different talents.

01:29.715 --> 01:31.423
Who can say who did what?

01:31.509 --> 01:32.966
Is this dried blood?

01:33.052 --> 01:34.259
Uh, it's ketchup.

01:34.386 --> 01:35.969
Uh, our handyman
does repairs down here

01:36.097 --> 01:38.680
And says he works better
when he's eating.

01:38.808 --> 01:40.099
-He doesn't.
-Hm.
-Oh.

01:40.142 --> 01:41.391
-Mm-hmm.
-I can fix it,

01:41.519 --> 01:43.268
But you won't have power
for three or four days.

01:43.395 --> 01:45.938
What?!
But christmas is in two days!

01:46.023 --> 01:47.940
I know.
And I'm excited to be here.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.942
We can't have no power
for christmas!

01:50.111 --> 01:52.236
Your landlord should
put you up somewhere.

01:52.321 --> 01:53.362
What, me?

01:53.447 --> 01:55.531
Why is it always
the landlord's problem?

01:55.699 --> 01:56.865
Ugh, fine.

01:57.076 --> 02:00.536
Let's go and let him
do his precious up-to-code work.

02:00.663 --> 02:02.996
Should the sign just say,
"electricity's out.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.748
See you when we see you"?
That-that sounds wrong.

02:04.834 --> 02:07.626
Well, you're in luck.
I can put you up at the lodge.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.670
-The lodge?
-Yes. My family's
old hunting lodge.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.256
We don't use it much.
It's a bit, uh, hunty lodgey.

02:12.341 --> 02:14.049
My father bought it
when we were kids

02:14.135 --> 02:15.968
So he'd have a place
to do his falconry.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.845
<i> -Falcon crest?</i>
-Falconry. It's a-it's a--

02:17.930 --> 02:20.556
-Oh.
-It's-it's a kind of hunting
with trained falcons.

02:20.683 --> 02:22.975
He wasn't any good at it
and they usually flew away,

02:23.060 --> 02:24.768
But we just kept
buying him more falcons.

02:24.854 --> 02:26.979
It was nice, actually,
because he was hard to shop for.

02:27.106 --> 02:28.772
Can you excuse us a sec?

02:28.858 --> 02:30.941
Are we gonna spend christmas
in mr. Fischoeder's lodge?

02:31.026 --> 02:33.110
Not be in our house?
For christmas?

02:33.195 --> 02:34.945
It sounds sad and terrible.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.905
I know, but power is good?

02:37.032 --> 02:38.907
Why did mr. Fischoeder have
to call a real electrician?

02:38.993 --> 02:40.826
Teddy could have
gotten us through christmas.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.494
-Teddy did this.
-Don't blame him

02:42.663 --> 02:44.079
Just 'cause he doesn't know
what he's doing.

02:44.206 --> 02:45.998
(groans) can we bring
our christmas stuff?

02:46.125 --> 02:48.208
And the tree?
Make it feel more like home?

02:48.294 --> 02:50.043
Sure. Wait. The tree? How?

02:50.129 --> 02:51.336
We-we already decorated it.

02:51.422 --> 02:53.338
-I need the tree, bob.
-Uh, okay, okay.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.257
-I need it.
-I got it.
-[clears throat]

02:55.384 --> 02:56.842
Well, you seem very excited.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.719
And I was thinking
of not standing here anymore.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.179
So, can I call the caretaker

03:00.297 --> 03:02.014
And tell him not to drive up
to the lodge tonight?

03:02.099 --> 03:04.183
-The caretaker?
-Yes, old mr. Mccormick.

03:04.268 --> 03:06.351
You'd be
doing me a favor, really,

03:06.437 --> 03:08.103
If you'd spend
a few nights there.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.479
I wouldn't have to
pay that crank

03:09.607 --> 03:11.231
To lick the pipes
or whatever it is he does

03:11.275 --> 03:12.774
To keep the heat
and water running.

03:12.902 --> 03:14.234
-Lick the pipes?
-I don't know.

03:14.320 --> 03:17.070
It's an old house, but we pay
old crotchety mccormick

03:17.198 --> 03:19.281
To go up there,
and if you good folks go up,

03:19.408 --> 03:22.743
You can lick the pipes and, uh,
I could save the five dollars.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.536
Look at the tree, poor thing.

03:24.663 --> 03:26.705
Is there any way
we can play it some music

03:26.832 --> 03:28.248
Or a podcast or something?

03:28.334 --> 03:30.334
-I don't think so.
-Okay, never mind.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.544
We got the cooking stuff,
we got the stockings.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.046
Oh, I forgot the deodorant.

03:34.173 --> 03:36.173
Eh, that's okay.
Maybe, santa'll bring some.

03:36.258 --> 03:37.925
-Yeah.
-Wait. Oh, crap!

03:38.010 --> 03:39.760
How will santa know that we're
going to a different house?

03:39.845 --> 03:42.179
Is there paperwork we
have to fill out or something?

03:42.264 --> 03:44.598
He knows, honey.
They track our phones, I think.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.141
-That sounds right.
-Yeah.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.101
Okay, uh, so do we know that
for sure?

03:48.187 --> 03:50.979
-Do we know that for sure?!
-Louise, it'll be fine.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.272
We have to go. I want to try

03:52.399 --> 03:53.899
And make it up the mountain
before dark.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.984
[linda] okay.
Everyone, say, "bye, house."

03:56.111 --> 03:57.945
[all]
bye, house.

03:58.030 --> 03:59.905
[gasps]
uh, you, too, restaurant! Phew.

04:00.032 --> 04:02.199
That was close.
We almost had to go back.

04:02.993 --> 04:05.035
[bob]
oh, god. I'm not sure

04:05.162 --> 04:07.204
The tires can handle this.
They're-they're pretty bald.

04:07.289 --> 04:08.622
Look who's talking.

04:08.666 --> 04:10.540
Yeah, aren't we supposed
to have chains or something?

04:10.668 --> 04:12.417
Like cool chains
that connect to our wallets?

04:12.503 --> 04:14.127
[bob]
oh, god. Oh, god. Oh, god.

04:14.255 --> 04:15.837
[louise]
this is like a nightmare.
-[bob] I know.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.839
I-I'm very scared,
but I'm being brave.

04:17.967 --> 04:19.424
-No, dad. The santa thing.
-Oh.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.426
I had very reasonable stuff
on my list,

04:21.553 --> 04:23.637
And I was exactly
a reasonable amount of good,

04:23.764 --> 04:25.847
So I was expecting
to run the table this year.

04:25.975 --> 04:28.100
I was gonna get the whole list.
The whole list!

04:28.185 --> 04:30.811
No screaming unless we're
tumbling off the cliff, please.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.271
Louise, honey, calm down.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.273
We'd all rather be home
for christmas in the place

04:34.441 --> 04:35.732
Where we've spent
every christmas

04:35.901 --> 04:38.277
Since you kids were born,
but we're not, and that's fine.

04:38.404 --> 04:39.945
-It's fine.
-Guys, there's no way

04:40.030 --> 04:41.780
Santa's gonna be able
to find us.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.573
Do your phones
even work up here?

04:43.701 --> 04:45.575
I'm pretty sure
santa's got, um, sleigh-dar.

04:45.661 --> 04:47.369
Hit him up on linkedin.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.246
[bob]
oh, I don't like that.

04:49.373 --> 04:50.914
We gonna make it,
or is this the end?

04:51.041 --> 04:52.165
Could go either way.

04:52.418 --> 04:54.209
Dad, you said you wanted
to get there before dark.

04:54.295 --> 04:55.627
-Yup.
-But it's dark.

04:55.671 --> 04:57.212
-Yup.
-So we really got to hurry.

04:57.298 --> 05:00.048
-[bob whimpers]
-dad's voice keeps
getting higher.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.675
Kids, no talking to your father.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.468
Close your eyes. Try to rest.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.220
And if we end up upside down
in a ravine,

05:05.389 --> 05:06.805
Go ahead
and eat your father and me.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.432
[gene]
I call mom's legs!

05:08.559 --> 05:10.475
-[louise] whoa.
-[gene] whoa.
-[tina] whoa.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.060
-[bob] thank god we made it.
-[linda sighs]

05:12.229 --> 05:13.478
[bob] I did that. I did it.

05:13.564 --> 05:15.105
[linda] good driving, bobby.
Pretty much.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.107
All right, everyone
grab something and bring it

05:17.234 --> 05:21.361
Into mr. Fischoeder's old, dark,
not-too-scary, mountain mansion.

05:21.447 --> 05:23.447
It's kind of cool looking.
And... We're alive.

05:23.532 --> 05:25.365
I'm still just so happy
about that.

05:25.451 --> 05:27.242
Once we turn on some lights
and start a fire

05:27.328 --> 05:29.828
And bring in the decorations,
I bet it'll be really nice.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.455
Yeah, I've had a box
of ornaments

05:31.540 --> 05:32.956
On my lap for 90 miles.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.500
-They'd better earn their keep.
-You're right, kids.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.627
We'll christmas the hell
out of this place.

05:37.713 --> 05:40.047
But, uh, let's do all
the decorating stuff tomorrow,

05:40.174 --> 05:41.548
-Right?
-Oh, yeah.

05:41.633 --> 05:42.966
Tonight, I'm only unpacking

05:43.052 --> 05:45.052
The rudolph the red wine
reindeer glasses

05:45.179 --> 05:46.803
And pouring us a glass of--
oh, my god!

05:46.889 --> 05:48.180
-What?
-Where's the tree?!

05:48.265 --> 05:50.599
-Oh my god.
-Where's the tree?!

05:54.855 --> 05:56.188
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

05:56.315 --> 05:58.607
The tree must have fallen off
on the drive up here.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.526
Oh, I knew we should have
put the tree on my lap somehow.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.653
Or at least that thing
where you hold onto it

06:03.697 --> 06:05.364
With one arm out the window.

06:05.491 --> 06:07.866
Like dad did with my old
mattress before it blew off.

06:07.993 --> 06:09.868
We should have had
a professional come tie it on.

06:09.995 --> 06:12.579
Like a surgeon,
a-a tree surgeon or something.

06:12.748 --> 06:14.247
Instead of us burger people.

06:14.375 --> 06:16.375
-We did our best.
-That doesn't sound like us.

06:16.418 --> 06:19.836
It was the road.
That bumpy, snowy, evil road.

06:19.922 --> 06:22.381
Uh, okay, okay.
So it's... It fell off.

06:22.508 --> 06:24.383
We'll just drive back down
and get it.

06:24.510 --> 06:26.510
-Oh, no, no. No.
-Yes, bob. The tree!

06:26.595 --> 06:28.887
Linda, it-it's a miracle
that we're here.

06:28.931 --> 06:30.639
We shouldn't have driven
on that road

06:30.724 --> 06:33.642
In this car with these tires,
and it's snowing.

06:33.769 --> 06:35.268
Every moment,
the road is getting worse.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.062
We-we can't drive back to town.

06:37.147 --> 06:40.107
Oh! Bobby, I can't stand
thinking about our tree

06:40.234 --> 06:42.567
Outside in the cold all alone.

06:42.653 --> 06:45.404
It's fine. That's how a tree
spends its entire life.

06:45.489 --> 06:47.030
-Well, that's just awful.
-I know.

06:47.157 --> 06:49.825
-Awful.
-Yup. Come on,
let-let's go inside.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.493
[whines]

06:52.746 --> 06:54.329
Uh, I'll, uh,
I'll put this down

06:54.415 --> 06:56.081
And, uh, feel
for a light switch.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.791
Well, your father's gone.
He's never coming back.

06:57.876 --> 07:00.252
I'd take out my phone if
I had one and use it as a light,

07:00.379 --> 07:01.920
-But, you know.
-Tina not now.

07:02.005 --> 07:04.131
-You won't let me get a phone...
-Shushies.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.216
-Aah!
-Aah!
-Bad falcon!

07:06.343 --> 07:07.968
This is kinda nice.

07:08.053 --> 07:10.178
Looks like they updated
the kitchen at some point.

07:10.222 --> 07:12.931
A guy could maybe
cook a christmas meal in here?

07:13.058 --> 07:15.350
-[gene] guy fieri?
--Louise] chimney. Okay, check.

07:15.436 --> 07:17.352
That's one thing
going for us, santa-wise.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.229
And we can have
all our shareholder meetings

07:19.314 --> 07:21.857
At this totally
normal-sized table,

07:21.900 --> 07:24.651
-So that's good.
-Um, that's terrifying.

07:24.695 --> 07:26.862
It's, uh, very falcony.

07:26.989 --> 07:27.904
Why is it so big?

07:28.031 --> 07:29.573
Oh, god,
I'll have to look at it

07:29.658 --> 07:30.949
While I'm cooking, too.

07:30.993 --> 07:32.284
Uh, I bet we'll all
get used to it,

07:32.369 --> 07:34.077
And then we won't even
notice it anymore. Maybe?

07:34.163 --> 07:35.412
Yeah, like dad's dead tooth.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.122
-Or his dead toenail.
-They're not dead,

07:37.207 --> 07:38.540
They're just struggling.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.584
Well, should we figure out
where they put the beds

07:40.711 --> 07:41.877
In this winter wonderland?

07:41.962 --> 07:44.129
I call the room with
the fewest dead animals.

07:44.256 --> 07:46.631
-What the heck is that?
-There's a little plaque.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.508
It says "indoor funicular

07:48.635 --> 07:51.720
By the argyle elevator and
mechanical amusements company."

07:51.847 --> 07:53.597
I loved their first album,
but then

07:53.724 --> 07:54.890
Stevie nicks left the band.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.808
-Should we ride it?
-Let's see if we can

07:56.977 --> 07:58.852
Figure out
how to work it. Oh.

07:58.979 --> 07:59.978
Top or bottom.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.688
-That's the eternal question.
-Okay.

08:01.773 --> 08:02.981
Ready?
Here-here we go.

08:03.141 --> 08:05.108
Everyone hold on to something
so you don't

08:05.235 --> 08:07.110
Fall when it takes off.

08:07.229 --> 08:09.488
[machine humming]

08:09.531 --> 08:12.824
-Are we moving?
-No, it hasn't started yet.

08:12.910 --> 08:14.034
Or wait. Has it?

08:14.119 --> 08:16.411
Should we just get out
and take the stairs?

08:16.580 --> 08:17.329
[gene]
gross.

08:17.498 --> 08:18.497
I call top bunk!

08:18.582 --> 08:20.749
Oh. No one else
is sleeping in here?

08:20.876 --> 08:22.501
Hey, I'm in
the elmer fudd suite.

08:22.586 --> 08:25.003
Fyi, I might have scary
dreams tonight. No reason.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.255
Is everyone else's bed
the size of our kitchen?

08:27.299 --> 08:29.382
What? No.
These beds are small.

08:29.468 --> 08:33.595
-Did you say yours is big?
-Uh, no. Good night.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.680
[bob]<i> why would anyone</i>

08:35.849 --> 08:37.140
Put that painting
in a dining room?

08:37.267 --> 08:39.518
-It'd look ridiculous
in the bathroom?
-[sighs]

08:39.561 --> 08:41.478
You know what should
go right there? The tree.

08:41.647 --> 08:43.146
It could look out
the window if it wants.

08:43.232 --> 08:45.899
-And think about what it's done.
-God, there's weird stuff

08:46.026 --> 08:47.567
On mr. Fischoeder's
caretaker's list.

08:47.653 --> 08:49.277
"beat the rugs with the drapes

08:49.404 --> 08:52.364
"while the curtains watch,
get mail from mailbox,

08:52.491 --> 08:55.075
"burn mail,
brush teeth on bear head.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.702
Never break eye contact."
hm.

08:57.829 --> 08:58.954
Dad, stop talking about
the list.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.872
The only list
that matters is santa's.

09:00.958 --> 09:02.207
Here's a thought.
What if he finds you

09:02.251 --> 09:03.575
By the smell of the cookies?

09:03.627 --> 09:05.835
-Oh, my god, the cookies.
-Yeah, I know. I'm smart.

09:05.963 --> 09:07.629
I forgot the flour
for the cookies.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.923
What?
So no tree and no cookies?

09:09.967 --> 09:12.008
We need to pull
this together, people.

09:12.094 --> 09:13.843
Maybe mr. Fischoeder has flour?

09:13.971 --> 09:15.845
I hope so, but I'm worried that

09:15.973 --> 09:18.306
If it is there
it might be very old.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.808
Or cocaine.
Also, louise,

09:19.977 --> 09:21.893
I-I think I can still
make cookies for santa

09:22.020 --> 09:24.521
-Without flour.
-Do you think santa's
gluten-free, dad?

09:24.648 --> 09:27.399
-I--
-do you think santa's
gluten-free, dad?!

09:27.484 --> 09:28.275
-Uh...
-Do you?!

09:28.360 --> 09:30.110
I think santa's mostly gluten.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.153
No flour, no cocaine,
but how about rum?

09:32.239 --> 09:34.281
Ugh!
This is a disaster.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.408
Look, we can at least
solve the tree problem.

09:36.535 --> 09:38.201
We're surrounded
by christmas trees.

09:38.328 --> 09:39.703
Let's just chop one down.

09:39.830 --> 09:42.122
A different tree?
A stranger tree?

09:42.207 --> 09:43.999
That we just met
in the forest somewhere?

09:44.084 --> 09:46.668
-I-I guess we could do that.
-But our tree.

09:46.795 --> 09:49.671
That we brought home.
That knows us and loves us.

09:49.756 --> 09:52.424
Mom, a tree in the hand
is better than one in a ditch.

09:52.551 --> 09:55.927
Oh, my god, poor tree
in a ditch. Ugh, okay, fine.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.096
Fine, we can go look.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.974
Well, the good news
is that axe seems pretty heavy,

10:01.018 --> 10:02.642
So there's no way dad has
the upper body strength

10:02.728 --> 10:04.102
To go full<i> shining</i> on us.

10:04.187 --> 10:06.646
Yeah. Half<i> shining</i> at most.
No offense, dad.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.231
I think I could<i> shining</i>
all of you if I had to.

10:08.358 --> 10:09.649
Although I'm tired
because I didn't

10:09.776 --> 10:12.235
Get enough sleep last night
on that little bed.

10:12.321 --> 10:14.195
Oh, yeah,
those beds are so tiny.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.739
-Uh, how-how about this one?
-Eh.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.407
-Or this one's nice.
-Meh.

10:17.534 --> 10:20.076
-Okay. How about this guy, huh?
-Eh...

10:20.162 --> 10:23.121
It's just, none of these trees
have what our tree has:

10:23.165 --> 10:24.748
That effortless charm and wit.

10:24.833 --> 10:28.043
That perfect bushiness, but
without being cocky about it.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.919
It was a little cocky.

10:30.005 --> 10:31.921
Okay, fine.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.506
Do it.
That one.

10:33.592 --> 10:35.216
So, I guess I just start

10:35.260 --> 10:36.468
Chopping at the trunky part?

10:36.553 --> 10:38.762
No technical terms.
Dumb it down for us.

10:38.847 --> 10:41.097
All right, maybe like, uh...

10:41.183 --> 10:43.475
Wait. Do trees die
when you cut them down?

10:43.560 --> 10:45.268
-Yeah, tina.
-Right.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.479
-[louise] uh...
-[tina groaning]

10:47.564 --> 10:49.230
-[gene whimpering]
-[linda] eh...

10:50.400 --> 10:52.067
-Forget it, forget it,
-yeah.

10:52.194 --> 10:53.193
-Stop, stop, stop.
-Phew.
-Oh, thank god.

10:53.278 --> 10:54.361
Bob, I want to go down and

10:54.529 --> 10:55.987
-Look for our tree.
-[bob groans]

10:56.073 --> 10:57.864
The sun is out.
The road is clear.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.991
And we need flour.
You stay with the kids.

11:00.077 --> 11:01.159
I'll just zip down
to that little market

11:01.244 --> 11:02.494
At the bottom of the mountain

11:02.579 --> 11:04.371
And be back quicker
than you can lick a pipe.

11:04.498 --> 11:05.955
Oh, right, we haven't
licked the pipes yet.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.791
-This is a good plan.
-But, lin,

11:07.918 --> 11:08.917
We don't even know
where it fell off.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.211
Sure we do.
Somewhere between here

11:11.296 --> 11:12.712
And the bottom of the mountain.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.130
She's hot on its trail.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.382
Even if you find the tree,

11:15.509 --> 11:17.008
How-how will you get it
in the car?

11:17.135 --> 11:19.302
I'll use my superhuman
christmas magic mom strength.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.221
Yeah. Or she'll just
close the door on it

11:21.348 --> 11:22.514
And drag it alongside the car

11:22.557 --> 11:24.099
Like she does
with her purse sometimes.

11:24.226 --> 11:25.392
And her skirts.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.018
And if that doesn't work,
I'll come get you

11:27.104 --> 11:28.395
And we'll both do it.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.271
I'm gonna save christmas.
Oh, wait.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.856
I don't have my keys.
Or my wallet.

11:32.016 --> 11:33.108
And I better
go inside and pee first.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.234
Uh, let's all go in.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.319
But maybe mr. Axe stays outside?

11:36.446 --> 11:39.030
Oh, yeah. Mr. Axe
is gonna go back in the shed

11:39.116 --> 11:40.865
With his friend mr. Machete.

11:40.951 --> 11:42.909
And I think
I saw a hand grenade,

11:42.994 --> 11:44.828
So nobody go in there.

11:44.913 --> 11:47.247
[linda]
don't worry, tree,
I'm coming for you.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.708
Dang it, I wish
I gave you a flare gun.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.876
Okay, I got to stay positive.

11:51.962 --> 11:54.212
Can't give up.
Christmas miracle time.

11:54.297 --> 11:56.339
Here we go.
I'm gonna find you.

11:56.466 --> 11:59.092
Oh, crap, I'm at
the bottom of the mountain.

11:59.136 --> 12:01.594
[all grunting]

12:01.722 --> 12:03.179
Louise, you don't seem
that into this.

12:03.265 --> 12:05.390
You're not aiming for my glasses
like you usually do.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.517
Yeah, I know, sorry. It's just,
look at that big field.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.978
I guess we're calling anything
a field these days.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.646
You think if we spelled
something out with fire,

12:11.732 --> 12:14.357
Santa could see it from
his satellite or whatever?

12:14.443 --> 12:16.526
-Come on.
-Oh, yeah, that could work.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.612
But maybe not fire,
because it's fire. Um,

12:19.740 --> 12:21.531
-What about sticks?
-And stones?

12:21.616 --> 12:22.574
No, wait-- our bones.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.909
At least I got the stupid flour.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.995
Oh, tree, I give up.
I'm never gonna find you.

12:27.122 --> 12:28.955
Oh, my god, there you are!

12:29.040 --> 12:30.373
Our tree. It's our tree!

12:30.459 --> 12:32.250
I never gave up on you.
Whoa. Okay, don't die.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.710
Don't die. Don't die.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.591
I can't wait to tell bob
I found our tree. And he thought

12:39.718 --> 12:40.884
I couldn't do it.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.469
I'll only say "I told you so,"
like, four times.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.971
Maybe five.
Why isn't it ringing?

12:45.015 --> 12:46.181
Oh, no bars.

12:46.975 --> 12:49.476
It's kind of steep,
but it's safe, right?

12:49.561 --> 12:51.511
Safe-ish. Whoa.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.897
Whoa! Whoa. Whoa...

12:53.982 --> 12:55.732
Okay, okay.

12:55.776 --> 12:56.691
Oh, boy.

12:56.735 --> 12:57.942
Okay, here we go.
Here we go.

12:58.069 --> 12:59.778
This is better.
This is better.

12:59.863 --> 13:01.112
Oh, and butt's getting
pretty wet.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.448
Butt's getting wet.
[shouting]

13:03.492 --> 13:05.241
Whoa. [shouting]

13:05.368 --> 13:06.618
[grunts]

13:06.745 --> 13:08.536
And that's how you do that.

13:08.663 --> 13:11.122
Hey, lin, uh,
I haven't heard from you.

13:11.249 --> 13:13.124
Uh, hope you're okay and, uh,

13:13.251 --> 13:15.084
Not, uh,
running out of gas somewhere

13:15.128 --> 13:17.796
Or being torn apart
by anything in the woods.

13:17.923 --> 13:19.422
Not-not that you would
get torn apart.

13:19.508 --> 13:21.758
You're-you're a strong person.
I definitely would.

13:21.843 --> 13:24.803
Between the two of us,
I would be the one to get torn--

13:24.846 --> 13:26.137
Forget it. Call me.

13:26.264 --> 13:28.640
[louise]
[sighs] boy, this is taking
a long time.

13:28.767 --> 13:31.142
Do you think "bel" kind of
gets the point across?

13:31.228 --> 13:33.645
[gene]
as long as he doesn't think
it's bell biv devoe.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.730
-[tina] or harry belafonte.
-[gene] or mr. Belvedere.

13:35.857 --> 13:37.816
Oh, god.
Okay, okay. We got to finish it.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.400
But we're running out
of big branches.

13:39.528 --> 13:42.695
We could use mom and dad's
clothes. Or gene?

13:42.781 --> 13:44.447
I am good at lying down.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.699
[groaning]

13:48.620 --> 13:50.912
Aah! Whoa.

13:50.956 --> 13:52.705
No! Oh, come on.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.583
Why does dragging
a christmas tree

13:55.627 --> 13:59.629
Up a snowy mountain
have to be so hard?

14:01.550 --> 14:04.467
Okay, I don't love that.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.386
Oh, sun's gone.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.221
Ooh, that is cold.
That is very cold.

14:08.306 --> 14:10.557
Can you die of cold?
No, right?

14:10.600 --> 14:11.766
That's only in the movies.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.601
[bob]
<i> [grunts] get up there.</i>

14:13.645 --> 14:15.562
Oh... [grunts] come on.

14:15.605 --> 14:16.938
What are you doing?

14:17.065 --> 14:18.356
Uh, I'm trying to make it
so that I don't have to

14:18.400 --> 14:19.691
Look at this painting anymore.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.484
-[grunts]
-you did it. Good job.

14:21.603 --> 14:24.779
Thanks. I-I'm just glad
it finally w-- mm.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.990
-Oh, sorry.
-Yeah. What are you doing?

14:27.033 --> 14:28.283
We're looking for stuff
to spell out

14:28.410 --> 14:29.784
A giant message to santa.

14:29.870 --> 14:32.161
You don't love the clothes
you brought with you, right?

14:32.289 --> 14:34.998
I don't love them,
but I want to keep them inside.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.124
Like your feelings.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.500
Can't you just use branches

14:37.627 --> 14:38.626
Since we're in the woods?

14:38.753 --> 14:39.794
We found some, but it's snowy,

14:39.838 --> 14:40.628
And they're deep down,

14:40.672 --> 14:42.422
And our tiny hands got cold.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.549
So we're actually gonna
need this. Thank you.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.718
-No, no, no, I need that.
-I need this.

14:46.803 --> 14:47.969
-No.
-I need this!

14:48.096 --> 14:49.429
-Louise.
-Fine.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.514
[grunts] uh... Uh-oh.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.682
So you took care of that.

14:52.851 --> 14:54.809
Uh, it turns out
I'm not good at--

14:54.936 --> 14:56.311
-No, louise, no, no.
-What?

14:56.396 --> 14:57.729
-No. Put it down.
-Okay...

14:57.856 --> 14:58.813
-What about...
-Put it down.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.690
Ugh! Do you hate presents?

15:00.775 --> 15:01.774
Aah! I'm all right.

15:01.860 --> 15:05.820
Ah, ha, ha, tina!
You beautiful beast.

15:05.906 --> 15:08.072
Dad, are these allowed outside?

15:08.241 --> 15:09.490
-Any objections?
-Mm.

15:09.618 --> 15:11.618
Gene, come grab
these spelling sticks.

15:11.703 --> 15:12.911
If I wanted to carry skis,

15:12.954 --> 15:15.079
I would have gone with ken
to breckenridge.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.956
[panting]
oh, please.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.291
Please let me make it
to the car.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.002
Oh, I can't wait
to put that heater on.

15:21.129 --> 15:23.421
I love that heater so much.

15:23.548 --> 15:24.547
Almost there.

15:24.633 --> 15:27.508
So tired.
Body giving out.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.010
Spirit giving out.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.346
Bladder holding on. Mostly.

15:31.473 --> 15:32.388
Hang on, tree.

15:32.557 --> 15:35.683
I'm gonna put ornaments
all over you.

15:35.727 --> 15:37.894
Whoa...!

15:37.979 --> 15:39.270
Oh! Oh, thank god.

15:39.397 --> 15:42.899
Thank god--
no! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:42.984 --> 15:44.317
Oh! [shouting]

15:44.444 --> 15:46.069
Oh!

15:47.322 --> 15:50.782
No...!

15:50.867 --> 15:53.159
-[bird screeches]
-oh, hush.

15:57.248 --> 15:59.582
Hey, lin, uh, me again.
Please don't be dead.

15:59.709 --> 16:00.833
That's my one request.

16:00.961 --> 16:03.419
Oh, and flour.
But mostly don't be dead

16:03.546 --> 16:06.172
Because I don't know
how I'd go on without you.

16:06.257 --> 16:08.716
And also, you're better
at wrapping presents than me.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.718
-Okay, goodbye.
-Dad, go to the window.

16:10.845 --> 16:13.304
Look out-look out the window.
Go, go, go to the window, dad.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.848
Okay. "belcher."
looks good.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.558
I hope you're excited
to bring all that

16:17.602 --> 16:18.935
Back in the house later.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.770
That sounds like
a caretaker's responsibility.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.563
So, okay,
I'm gonna take a walk,

16:22.649 --> 16:26.442
Mostly to, uh, you know,
get some air, enjoy nature.

16:26.528 --> 16:28.277
But also to see
if your mom crashed the car

16:28.405 --> 16:29.821
And is freezing to death
somewhere.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.614
-[kids] oh.
-She has been gone a while.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.616
I just assumed she and the tree
ran off together

16:33.702 --> 16:36.077
And she'd send for the children
once they're settled.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.246
Honestly, guys, it's a long shot
mom would be able

16:38.373 --> 16:39.872
To find the tree.
I'm sorry.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.749
But I-I'm gonna
see if I can find her.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.669
But mom is in a car.
You are on your--

16:44.838 --> 16:46.337
No offense-- very slow legs.

16:46.423 --> 16:47.964
Well, I-I need to do something.

16:48.049 --> 16:49.382
Your-your mom might be stuck.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.300
Is this partly
to get away from the painting?

16:51.469 --> 16:53.761
No. A little.
I really don't like it.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.805
It'll be okay.
I'll be back soon.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.390
Uh, with your mom.
Who's fine.

16:57.434 --> 16:58.933
And the car.
Both in one piece.

16:59.060 --> 17:01.602
Hopefully. Totally alive.
Both of them.

17:01.730 --> 17:04.731
Uh, well, not the ca--
it's fine.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.650
[grunting]

17:09.696 --> 17:12.447
Whoa! Oh, okay.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.449
Okay, we got a problem.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.577
Oh! I don't know
how to tell you this.

17:17.620 --> 17:20.455
I'm not gonna be able
to bring you up, tree.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.706
[sniffles]
huh.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.374
I could tell you that
I'm gonna go get bob

17:23.460 --> 17:25.668
And a rope,
and we'll be back for you,

17:25.795 --> 17:27.378
But here's the thing.

17:27.422 --> 17:29.505
I don't think
that's a good idea.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.300
I love you, tree,
but if I come back with bob

17:32.460 --> 17:34.969
And we both die,
the kids'll be all alone,

17:35.096 --> 17:36.763
And I don't think they'll put
themselves to bed

17:36.890 --> 17:38.514
At a reasonable hour.
You know?

17:38.641 --> 17:41.184
And I'm kind of missing
christmas eve over here.

17:41.269 --> 17:43.394
I know I picked you
out of all the other trees,

17:43.521 --> 17:45.146
And you were the one,
you really were.

17:45.273 --> 17:48.566
[sniffles] but I got to
leave you here, my sweet baby.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.234
Mama's got to go.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.986
Here.

17:52.113 --> 17:53.696
I know you like ornaments.

17:53.782 --> 17:55.990
Eh. Eh. [sniffles]

17:56.034 --> 17:57.366
There. [sniffles]

17:57.494 --> 17:59.952
You look beautiful.
Okay.

17:59.996 --> 18:02.955
Okay, I got to go now.

18:02.999 --> 18:06.959
Nope, nope, you can't come.
You can't come.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.961
I'm sorry. Sorry.

18:09.047 --> 18:11.464
I'm sorry. Get off!

18:11.549 --> 18:13.758
Get off! I'm sorry.

18:13.802 --> 18:16.219
You look beautiful.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.471
[grunting]

18:25.563 --> 18:26.729
Is that linda?

18:26.856 --> 18:28.272
Bob? Bob!

18:28.399 --> 18:30.233
-Linda!
-What are you doing out here?

18:30.360 --> 18:31.234
Uh, looking for you.

18:31.361 --> 18:32.902
I left you a bunch of messages.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.403
I didn't have any bars.

18:34.489 --> 18:35.988
Were you looking for the tree
this whole time?

18:36.116 --> 18:37.323
I found it.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.616
-You did?
-Yeah.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.952
We, uh, we got ourselves
into a little situation.

18:40.995 --> 18:43.955
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You have a stick in your hair.

18:43.998 --> 18:46.582
And snow in my pants
and in my underwear.

18:46.668 --> 18:48.960
Everything's numb down there.
I'm not peeing, am I?

18:49.045 --> 18:51.879
I-I don't think so.
Uh, but where-where's the tree?

18:52.006 --> 18:54.048
Ugh.
The tree didn't make it, bob.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.967
-Oh.
-Yep, yep.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.844
She's gone. She's gone.

18:57.929 --> 19:00.096
-Oh, I'm sorry, lin.
-Yeah.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.932
-[bob] did you get the flour?
-Yes, I got the flour.

19:03.059 --> 19:05.726
Geez, have some respect
for the dead, huh?

19:06.855 --> 19:08.062
Look who got flour.

19:08.231 --> 19:09.438
-Mom!
-Mom!
-Momala!

19:09.566 --> 19:10.940
My genie beanie. Aw.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.484
My teeny tina.
And my squeezy louisey.

19:13.611 --> 19:16.112
-Dad's back, too.
-Good to see you, man.

19:16.197 --> 19:17.238
I should have been here,

19:17.323 --> 19:18.614
Spending the day
with my babies.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.658
And I couldn't bring home
our christmas tree.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.451
-I'm really sorry.
-That's okay.

19:22.579 --> 19:23.578
-We made one.
-[gasps]

19:23.663 --> 19:26.372
Oh, it's the best
christmas tree ever.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.125
[louise]
yeah, 'cause where's santa
gonna put the presents, right?

19:29.252 --> 19:30.877
I mean, we assumed
you were gonna get the tree,

19:30.962 --> 19:33.838
-But just in case, tina said
we should make a backup.
-What?

19:33.923 --> 19:36.007
I love it.
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

19:36.134 --> 19:37.341
Sorry I've been
such a crumb bum

19:37.510 --> 19:39.093
About coming here.
I just want to be

19:39.179 --> 19:40.803
Wherever you guys are.
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah,

19:40.930 --> 19:42.388
Mwah, mwah, mwah.
Christmas!

19:42.515 --> 19:44.557
So you dug down in the snow
and found more branches?

19:44.684 --> 19:47.226
God no. We borrowed some
from the santa signal

19:47.312 --> 19:49.645
And then we just filled in
with some perfectly okay things

19:49.731 --> 19:51.439
From the house that you said
were fine to take.

19:51.566 --> 19:53.357
-[linda]
oh, you used the towels.
-[tina] all of them.

19:53.443 --> 19:56.569
-We weren't gonna bathe, right?
-Why start now?
-[bob] mm.

19:56.654 --> 19:57.945
And we made dad something, too.

19:58.114 --> 19:59.989
-[bob] you covered it?
-[gene] we used wrapping paper

20:00.074 --> 20:01.699
And the cheap tape mom buys,
so we may have to

20:01.743 --> 20:03.075
Re-stick it a few times.

20:03.161 --> 20:04.702
That looks so much better.

20:04.829 --> 20:07.330
It's like they're excited
about opening that present.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.123
Which is probably a dead bunny.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.833
Okay, I'm gonna
go dig the snow out of my butt,

20:10.960 --> 20:13.044
And then let's bake
some cookies!

20:13.171 --> 20:15.004
I bet mrs. Claus
says the same thing every year.

20:15.131 --> 20:17.840
[louise] all right, the ball's
in your court, santa.

20:17.926 --> 20:19.592
