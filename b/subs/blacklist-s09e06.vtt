00:01.001 --> 00:03.002
[tense music playing]

00:04.295 --> 00:05.547
I've lost the will.

00:07.257 --> 00:11.386
Performing at my level,
there's absolutely no room for error.

00:11.469 --> 00:14.222
It's just a lot of pressure.

00:14.305 --> 00:16.641
-Mm-hm.
-You know? Too much.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.102
We've talked about the adverse ways

00:19.185 --> 00:22.230
that pressure has manifested in your life.

00:22.313 --> 00:25.191
But we've also discovered helpful ways.

00:26.359 --> 00:30.822
Remember, behind every shadow,
there is a light.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.535
Your next performance is this afternoon?

00:35.618 --> 00:36.536
Oh, my God.

00:36.619 --> 00:39.414
-I don't think I can--
-Oh. Randall, look at me.

00:39.497 --> 00:40.707
Randall.

00:40.790 --> 00:43.918
The time has come for you
to tell yourself a different story.

00:44.002 --> 00:48.590
Embrace the shadow
and you will find the light.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.926
Now close your eyes...

00:52.802 --> 00:54.429
and visualize.

00:54.512 --> 00:57.515
[classical music playing faintly
on violin]

00:59.559 --> 01:01.519
You're on the way to the venue.

01:03.354 --> 01:05.356
[classical music continues]

01:07.233 --> 01:09.819
[therapist] <i>You feel the music.</i>

01:14.074 --> 01:16.451
<i>Take a moment and let it center you.</i>

01:16.534 --> 01:17.786
[exhales]

01:17.869 --> 01:21.623
[therapist] <i>It reminds you that you, too,</i>
<i>are a virtuoso.</i>

01:21.706 --> 01:22.874
<i>And...</i>

01:23.958 --> 01:26.211
<i>as you have a hundred times before,</i>

01:26.294 --> 01:28.338
<i>you take up your instrument...</i>

01:31.382 --> 01:33.927
and find the light.

01:38.848 --> 01:39.849
[silenced gunshot]

01:44.354 --> 01:46.481
[people screaming]

01:57.992 --> 01:59.035
They know.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.954
Heber's just covering his ass.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.455
Charlene vouched for me.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.541
She lied to give me an alibi.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.042
He doesn't believe her.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.085
You're a cop.

02:07.168 --> 02:08.336
Heber's a cop.

02:08.419 --> 02:11.172
He doesn't wanna seem
like he's playing favorites.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.549
That's all this is.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.134
He doesn't suspect you.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.302
He will when the ballistics come back.

02:16.386 --> 02:17.762
Or haven't you been listening?

02:17.846 --> 02:21.224
Heber was here with a warrant
to test my service weapon.

02:21.307 --> 02:24.894
He'll know it was my gun
that was used to kill Doug Koster.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.147
Harold, it's going to be fine.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.691
My wife had an affair with Koster.

02:29.774 --> 02:32.735
Day after he's killed,
Heber sees me at the crime scene.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.279
My gun's the murder weapon.

02:34.362 --> 02:36.364
In what world does that add up to fine?

02:36.447 --> 02:37.866
[Agnes] Is Pinky still coming?

02:37.949 --> 02:39.117
He sure is.

02:39.617 --> 02:41.661
Look, I should get going.

02:41.744 --> 02:42.871
We'll talk later.

02:43.454 --> 02:45.039
Stop worrying.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.085
Well, hello, you.

02:49.168 --> 02:52.463
But when Pinky comes over,
we have to talk,

02:52.547 --> 02:54.090
then he's all yours.

02:54.173 --> 02:56.593
-What are you gonna talk about?
-That's the thing about Pinky.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.511
He always keeps you guessing.

02:58.595 --> 03:01.306
[Raymond] I assume this is on your radar.

03:02.056 --> 03:03.224
It is.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.644
Everyone's looking
for the congressman's would-be assassin.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.271
Mm. Naturally.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.772
But everyone is wrong.

03:10.273 --> 03:13.943
The congressman wasn't the target.
The victim was. Mary Parrot.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.363
An assassin's bullet narrowly misses
a controversial politician

03:17.447 --> 03:20.366
because it was actually aimed
at a beloved philanthropist?

03:20.450 --> 03:21.951
Her philanthropy was beloved.

03:22.035 --> 03:25.914
Her zeal for historical preservation?
Not so much.

03:25.997 --> 03:29.959
She single-handedly spiked
dozens of construction projects

03:30.043 --> 03:32.462
she believed would blight her fair city,

03:32.545 --> 03:36.925
denying powerful people
fortunes large and even larger.

03:37.008 --> 03:39.636
Including Vito DeCanio.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.306
You think the DeCanio crime syndicate
had Mary Parrot killed?

03:43.389 --> 03:44.224
I do.

03:44.307 --> 03:47.602
So you're putting them on the Blacklist.
Criminals we already know exist.

03:47.685 --> 03:52.690
What you know about the DeCanios is that
they were weak and now they're strong.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.525
What you don't know is why,

03:54.609 --> 03:58.154
or who is responsible
for their dramatic resurgence.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.822
It's not the old man?

04:01.115 --> 04:03.117
His therapist, actually.

04:03.701 --> 04:05.495
Dr. Roberta Sand.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.830
Everyone in the organization sees her.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.165
Vito's orders.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.291
A therapist

04:10.375 --> 04:13.461
to the mob
who makes the mob more effective.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.672
Self-actualized.

04:15.755 --> 04:19.509
The shrink helps them realize
their potential as criminals.

04:19.592 --> 04:23.471
Listen, I'm a criminal,
and however realized I may be

04:23.554 --> 04:27.183
is due in large part
to shrinks and shamans,

04:27.267 --> 04:29.185
rabbis and monks.

04:29.269 --> 04:33.189
They hold me together
like a psychological bandage,

04:33.273 --> 04:36.567
without which my sufferings
would be insufferable.

04:38.611 --> 04:42.156
You told me that if you came back,
names would be taken.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.158
A price would be paid.

04:44.742 --> 04:47.453
But you didn't tell me what names or why.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.747
I don't know the names.

04:50.248 --> 04:52.625
And without them, I don't know the why.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.169
Are you done talking yet?

04:56.587 --> 04:57.922
[Cooper] We are.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.925
Which means it's time for me
to get to the office,

05:01.009 --> 05:02.927
and for you two to have fun.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.470
Mooms is upstairs.

05:04.554 --> 05:08.057
If you or Pinky get hungry,
she can make you something.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.601
[Raymond] Oh, no. What's that?

05:10.685 --> 05:12.812
I'll play anything but gin again.

05:12.895 --> 05:15.273
At least until I read up on it a little.

05:15.356 --> 05:16.566
You're too good.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.276
And I was hopeless.

05:18.359 --> 05:19.736
It's not gin.

05:19.819 --> 05:20.987
It's a memory game.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.990
-Matching U.S. states and their capitals.
-Oh, my.

05:24.073 --> 05:26.284
Okay. Let's do it. I'm ready.

05:26.367 --> 05:29.829
Although I don't think I'll fare
any better than in gin.

05:29.912 --> 05:31.789
At least you have an excuse.

05:31.873 --> 05:32.790
What?

05:32.874 --> 05:35.251
I'm fine. My memory is fine.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.335
Sort of.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.129
I'm older. Not ancient.

05:38.212 --> 05:39.589
I didn't mean that.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.216
You won't know capitals
because you're not from here.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.053
-I wouldn't know the capitals of Russia.
-[tense music playing]

05:45.136 --> 05:46.220
Okay.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.513
Here's how you play.

05:48.639 --> 05:51.893
[Cooper] Vito DeCanio was a relic
of the past.

05:51.976 --> 05:53.144
A lion in winter.

05:53.227 --> 05:55.063
Until, according to Reddington,

05:55.146 --> 05:57.982
he hired a therapist
who goes by Dr. Roberta Sand.

05:58.066 --> 06:01.611
He's convinced the DeCanio family's
recent rise is her doing.

06:01.694 --> 06:02.737
Won't last long.

06:02.820 --> 06:05.948
A witness is in custody
who's going to testify tomorrow

06:06.032 --> 06:09.285
that DeCanio ordered
three separate hits on his rivals.

06:09.368 --> 06:10.912
I've been in therapy since I was 10.

06:10.995 --> 06:13.289
Never heard of a shrink
who helps people get worse.

06:13.372 --> 06:16.250
-Ten?
-I was having a hard time with calculus.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.794
You learned calculus at 10?

06:17.877 --> 06:21.756
I learned it at 8. I taught it at 10.
Or tried to.

06:21.839 --> 06:25.843
My parents couldn't grasp the concepts.
It was frustrating for everyone.

06:25.927 --> 06:29.806
I'm not sure I believe a therapist should
be held responsible for DeCanio's upswing,

06:29.889 --> 06:32.308
but according to Reddington,
DeCanio thinks she is.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.477
<i>That makes her very valuable to us.</i>

06:34.560 --> 06:37.396
Vito tells me he has a project for you.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.817
He says it requires teamwork
and cooperation.

06:40.900 --> 06:45.113
But he says you'd rather piss
on each other and say it's raining.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.658
So any thoughts?

06:49.158 --> 06:50.493
[belches]

06:52.328 --> 06:54.705
-[Sand] Hmm.
-[Aram] <i>We know anything about her?</i>

06:54.789 --> 06:55.748
Nothing.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.416
No photos, no prints.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.502
Search on her alias went nowhere.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.671
If we have no leads,
where should we start?

07:02.171 --> 07:03.256
Mary Parrot.

07:03.339 --> 07:07.718
Reddington says she isn't the victim
of a bullet meant for a politician.

07:07.802 --> 07:10.012
He says she was a preservationist

07:10.096 --> 07:12.348
who sidetracked
a number of lucrative developments

07:12.432 --> 07:13.808
DeCanio stood to benefit from.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.184
So he had her killed.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.310
Maybe.

07:16.394 --> 07:19.772
And maybe her killer
was under the good doctor's care.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.150
-Find him and maybe we find her.
-[door opens]

07:26.154 --> 07:27.697
Park asked if he could come.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.073
How are they doing?

07:29.574 --> 07:32.660
Not great. She thought him seeing
where she works might help.

07:32.743 --> 07:35.455
-Want me to bring him to her?
-I'll do it.

07:35.538 --> 07:38.082
We're shorthanded
since Ressler's taking a personal day.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.877
You two stay focused
on finding Mary Parrot's killer.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.476
Hey.

07:56.559 --> 07:57.894
I'm glad you're here.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.354
Are the episodes getting any better?

08:01.189 --> 08:04.233
If by "better," you mean it feels
like being stabbed in the eyes

08:04.317 --> 08:07.487
with a fork instead of a knife, then sure.

08:08.529 --> 08:09.739
The quiet helps.

08:10.448 --> 08:11.282
And caffeine.

08:11.365 --> 08:13.534
Anyway, uh, it's all passed now.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.954
-Let me give you a tour.
-I don't need a tour.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.540
[melancholy music playing]

08:19.624 --> 08:21.459
You wanting me to come is enough.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.255
What I do is secret.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.424
That I do it shouldn't be.

08:28.966 --> 08:29.884
Not from you.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.429
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.058
I've been reading medical journals.

08:37.141 --> 08:40.394
Researching everything I can
to find out what happened.

08:40.978 --> 08:43.564
Whether we lost the baby
because of my job...

08:44.440 --> 08:46.108
the directed energy weapon...

08:48.110 --> 08:50.071
I know you wanna know the reason.

08:50.571 --> 08:51.989
I'm sorry you don't.

08:53.324 --> 08:56.035
Man, I just keep saying sorry, don't I?

08:56.118 --> 08:57.411
It's fine.

08:57.495 --> 09:01.040
If I'm being honest,
you kind of have a lot to apologize for.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.334
But so do I.

09:05.586 --> 09:08.005
I don't want to believe

09:08.089 --> 09:11.217
I married someone who can hide everything.

09:12.343 --> 09:13.469
But I think I did.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.180
And that's what I'm sorriest about.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.892
That I married someone
I just don't know...

09:21.686 --> 09:22.853
if I know.

09:28.609 --> 09:31.279
Hey. Cooper updated me
while you were at the crime scene.

09:31.362 --> 09:32.280
Find anything?

09:32.363 --> 09:34.907
Okay, so NYPD is nowhere on the shooter.

09:34.991 --> 09:37.785
A passerby? Someone in a vehicle?
A building? They don't know.

09:37.868 --> 09:40.329
We read the eyewitness statements
and the ME reports.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.832
From that, we got this.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.751
[Aram] All right. The victim was here.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.588
Based on the entry wound,
the shooter was to the east.

09:48.671 --> 09:52.800
[Dembe] NYPD canvassed the most likely
building based on the assumed trajectory,

09:52.883 --> 09:54.844
which would put the shooter
on this rooftop.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.638
[Aram] They didn't find the shooter
or any evidence.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.808
So I think the shooter was here.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.893
Same angle, just farther back.

10:02.977 --> 10:06.689
The bullet goes over the rooftop
of the lower building, across the street,

10:06.772 --> 10:10.401
between those flagpoles and obstructions,
and into the victim.

10:10.484 --> 10:13.070
That building isn't further back.
It's in another county.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.281
-Who could make a shot like that?
-I could.

10:15.364 --> 10:18.534
I'll pull CCTV footage
from around that building.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.411
See if we can ID anyone.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.163
Vermont.

10:22.246 --> 10:23.080
Montpelier.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.666
Kentucky.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.043
Frankfort.

10:28.836 --> 10:29.795
Carson City.

10:29.879 --> 10:30.921
Nevada.

10:32.423 --> 10:34.008
Okay. Maybe I am ancient.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.677
I told you. You have an excuse.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.263
Yes. Thank goodness.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.390
Why did you stop being Russian?

10:41.474 --> 10:42.850
[tense music playing]

10:42.933 --> 10:44.602
That's a funny question.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.938
How did you know I was Russian?

10:48.022 --> 10:49.106
My mother told me.

10:49.190 --> 10:52.193
She told me everything I would need
to know about you.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.196
She must have said a lot.

10:55.279 --> 10:56.447
She did.

10:57.239 --> 10:59.116
But at the end of it,

10:59.700 --> 11:02.953
she said all I needed to remember
was that Raymond Reddington

11:03.037 --> 11:06.290
was the most important person
in her life besides me.

11:06.916 --> 11:10.920
She was glad that I had met you.
She wished that we could meet again.

11:13.047 --> 11:15.007
I'm really glad we did.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.181
She said you liked to hold hands.

11:26.602 --> 11:28.437
I'm starved.

11:30.606 --> 11:34.026
You wanna go see if Mooms
wants to eat with us?

11:34.110 --> 11:35.111
Okay.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.794
Dino, I need you to focus.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.088
We can't do this work without you.

11:54.171 --> 11:56.090
Be nice if he worked on something.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.968
I'm the brains and everybody knows it.

11:59.051 --> 12:02.012
Last I checked, you couldn't tell
a socket wrench from your elbow.

12:02.096 --> 12:06.183
Maybe that's 'cause I don't have to,
'cause I'm not a drudge like you.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.185
-Think you're better than us?
-I know I am.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.271
-Say that again.
-Gentlemen, gentlemen.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.815
I have a question for the three of you.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.818
What are you getting
out of all this anger?

12:15.901 --> 12:17.903
-He's gonna get his nose broken.
-[scoffs]

12:17.987 --> 12:19.405
And then what?

12:19.488 --> 12:23.784
You have a big project coming up
that requires teamwork.

12:23.868 --> 12:27.037
Do you think punching him in the face
is gonna make that happen?

12:27.121 --> 12:29.081
No. It's definitely not.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.124
[Sand] Exactly.

12:30.207 --> 12:33.627
Everyone has a path in life.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.921
And the path you're on,

12:36.005 --> 12:39.383
well, most people would say
that it's the wrong one.

12:40.134 --> 12:43.095
But what a man can be, he must be.

12:44.013 --> 12:49.518
So to be clear, I'm not here to tell you
to stop being angry or to judge you.

12:49.602 --> 12:53.481
No. My goal is to help you
stop judging yourselves.

12:53.564 --> 12:54.648
And each other.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.487
[Park] This is the roof from which
the sniper shot and killed Mary Parrot.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.573
And only three minutes after the murder,
who walks out the building

13:02.656 --> 13:06.202
but everyone's favorite noir stereotype,
Mr. Instrument-Case.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.912
[Aram] No ID on the sniper.

13:07.995 --> 13:11.790
On the plus side,
we happen to have a sniper on the payroll.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.126
Shooting from that distance
is extremely difficult

13:14.210 --> 13:15.628
and takes practice.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.588
[Aram] And when he says
"from that distance,"

13:17.671 --> 13:21.050
he means anywhere from 500 yards
to, I don't know, Kansas?

13:21.133 --> 13:22.384
Of the ranges in that area,

13:22.468 --> 13:24.845
there's only one
with lanes longer than 300 yards.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.097
And guess who's a member in good standing.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.016
[gunfire]

13:34.730 --> 13:36.065
As I live and breathe.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.608
It is good to see you.

13:37.691 --> 13:38.817
Hey, Jean.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.402
This is my friend Stacy.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.779
Nice to meet you.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.240
You gonna tell me what's going on?

13:44.323 --> 13:47.409
About a week back, Red comes out here
with this itty-bitty Latinx-er,

13:47.493 --> 13:48.911
acting like she's the new you.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.580
I appreciate your concern, but I'm fine.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.374
Raymond and I, we had a good run.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.584
What are you doing for an encore?

13:55.668 --> 13:57.336
I joined the FBI.

13:59.296 --> 14:00.422
[Park] I hired him.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.508
For a job that needs a pro's pro.

14:02.591 --> 14:06.262
Given what's required,
I'm told we should be asking for this man.

14:06.345 --> 14:09.640
Hmm. Beasley. He's a hell of a shot.

14:09.723 --> 14:11.642
Any chance you have an address?

14:21.569 --> 14:23.571
[suspenseful music playing]

14:32.288 --> 14:33.747
[alarm wailing]

14:33.831 --> 14:34.665
Get down!

14:37.209 --> 14:39.086
[gunfire]

15:02.192 --> 15:03.110
Got you.

15:10.701 --> 15:11.994
Randall Beasley.

15:12.494 --> 15:13.704
You're under arrest.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.712
[gloomy music playing]

15:35.309 --> 15:36.769
[Weecha] I don't understand.

15:37.603 --> 15:40.731
I thought you were having
such a fun time with Agnes.

15:50.115 --> 15:50.950
What is that?

15:53.827 --> 15:56.038
A piece of the past.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.541
The answers are here.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.502
In a letter she wrote to you.

16:05.714 --> 16:07.883
Why do you have a letter
my mother wrote to me?

16:07.967 --> 16:12.054
For when the time was right
to let you know the truth.

16:19.895 --> 16:21.689
What are you gonna do with it?

16:21.772 --> 16:23.607
Cvetko's meeting us at the jet.

16:23.691 --> 16:27.152
I'm hoping he can tell me
about its more recent history.

16:31.949 --> 16:32.908
[Weecha] Like what?

16:34.368 --> 16:35.577
I hate to think.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.500
[Park] We've gone through everything
at Beasley's house.

16:41.583 --> 16:46.463
Cache of weapons, letters from his mom
who thinks he's a PE teacher, and this.

16:46.547 --> 16:49.633
[Aram] Eleven appointments
just this month for dog grooming.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.344
-So he's a dog person.
-[Park] There's no evidence he had one.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.138
[Aram] If that's not curious enough,

16:54.221 --> 16:57.224
each appointment is scheduled
to take place at a different address.

16:57.307 --> 16:58.934
Intersections, actually.

16:59.018 --> 17:02.062
Second Avenue and 16th Street
on Tuesday the 30th.

17:02.146 --> 17:05.107
Then Friday the 3rd
on 63rd and Central Park West.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.526
None of which correspond
to a pet store or groomer.

17:07.609 --> 17:08.819
[Cooper] So it's a code.

17:08.902 --> 17:09.737
For what?

17:09.820 --> 17:11.697
We don't know the what. Just the how.

17:11.780 --> 17:14.033
Beasley would send a text
requesting an appointment,

17:14.116 --> 17:16.201
then get one back with a location.

17:16.285 --> 17:20.873
And this location is just a few blocks
from where Mary Parrot was killed.

17:20.956 --> 17:23.584
And the date and time is an hour
before he killed her.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.544
This is definitely evidence of something.

17:26.211 --> 17:28.047
You need to get him to tell us what.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.049
[cell phone ringing]

17:32.301 --> 17:33.469
Hey, Lew.

17:35.095 --> 17:35.929
Now?

17:36.680 --> 17:38.098
I'm in the middle of a--

17:39.475 --> 17:41.310
You got the ballistics report?

17:42.770 --> 17:44.563
Yeah, tell me where and when.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.274
The dog grooming.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.151
Tell us about it.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.904
I got a Lhasa apso. Her hair knots.

17:51.987 --> 17:53.447
We know it's a code.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.450
-Then what do you need me for?
-[Aram] You murdered an innocent woman.

17:56.950 --> 17:59.036
Yet here you are, calm as can be.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.205
And we know why.

18:01.705 --> 18:02.956
Therapy.

18:03.040 --> 18:07.377
A twisted version of counseling
to make you feel good about being bad.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.171
[Sand] And exhale.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.090
[all exhale]

18:12.132 --> 18:13.592
Now, how does that feel?

18:13.675 --> 18:14.718
[Mikey] Honestly?

18:15.719 --> 18:16.720
Better.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.848
Kind of like our hearts
started beating at the same time.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.892
That's what these are, right?

18:23.268 --> 18:24.686
Therapy appointments?

18:24.770 --> 18:26.063
I'm not talking about that.

18:26.146 --> 18:28.273
Eleven appointments in three weeks.

18:28.357 --> 18:32.111
That is almost one every other day.

18:33.529 --> 18:34.363
Why so many?

18:35.781 --> 18:39.910
That's how long it took Dr. Sand
to convince you it was okay to kill.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.246
That's what she did, isn't it?

18:42.329 --> 18:44.498
Make you feel okay about murder.

18:44.581 --> 18:45.541
[Sand] <i>Dino?</i>

18:45.624 --> 18:48.752
There's no wrong answers as long
as you're honest about how you feel.

18:48.836 --> 18:49.795
I, uh...

18:50.504 --> 18:51.922
I feel all right.

18:53.048 --> 18:55.425
I'm not saying I'm happy
about Johnny threatening me,

18:55.509 --> 18:56.718
but I get it.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.847
We need to swallow our pride

18:59.930 --> 19:01.098
for the good of the team.

19:01.890 --> 19:03.225
Johnny?

19:03.308 --> 19:04.643
Want me to be honest?

19:04.726 --> 19:05.769
Absolutely.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.479
This doesn't work unless you are.

19:07.563 --> 19:08.564
Okay, then.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.023
Uh, honestly?

19:10.107 --> 19:12.025
I feel like I'm on an episode of <i>Dr. Phil.</i>

19:12.109 --> 19:13.068
Hey!

19:13.152 --> 19:14.695
[Aram] <i>As bad as we know you are,</i>

19:14.778 --> 19:17.531
we think Dr. Sand is worse.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.617
Help us and we'll help you.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.495
[Aram] The codes are appointments.

19:24.913 --> 19:26.206
Show us how it works.

19:28.625 --> 19:32.880
I understand how it feels to have guilt
about things you've done in the past.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.467
You know what you did was wrong.

19:40.387 --> 19:41.805
Show us you know.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.475
[foghorn blares]

19:45.559 --> 19:46.810
[Sand] Johnny's not ready.

19:46.894 --> 19:47.978
It's a three-man job.

19:48.061 --> 19:50.272
[Sand] One you said
requires complete trust.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.607
Johnny doesn't have it.

19:51.690 --> 19:55.027
-Maybe if I had more time with him--
-Not an option.

19:55.110 --> 19:57.946
Then my advice is you find someone else.

19:59.948 --> 20:00.949
What about Dante?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.367
[tense music playing]

20:03.410 --> 20:05.996
-You know the answer to that.
-You said we need somebody--

20:06.079 --> 20:07.956
I did. But not him.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.250
It's an important job.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.753
We have an understanding.

20:12.836 --> 20:15.005
[DeCanio] If it goes well,
he can write his own ticket.

20:15.088 --> 20:16.131
[cell phone chimes]

20:19.509 --> 20:21.386
Look, you're the best at what you do,

20:21.470 --> 20:25.098
which is making people
feel good about themselves.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.976
At what I do, I'm the best.

20:28.477 --> 20:31.813
And making people feel good
has nothing to do with it.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.901
Are you threatening me?
After everything I've done for you?

20:35.984 --> 20:40.405
Aw, first of all, we both know
who you do it for, and it sure ain't me.

20:40.489 --> 20:41.865
And secondly, yeah.

20:42.574 --> 20:43.784
I'm threatening you.

20:44.701 --> 20:45.744
That's what I do.

20:46.995 --> 20:48.121
Dante's in.

20:48.622 --> 20:51.124
You got a problem with that, see a shrink.

21:01.009 --> 21:03.512
[intriguing music playing]

21:13.146 --> 21:15.983
Is that--?
It's really dog-grooming appointments?

21:16.066 --> 21:18.902
I don't know if the president's dog
is in there getting a trim,

21:18.986 --> 21:21.947
but Jazz Paws is tricked out
with armored panels and a GPS jammer.

21:22.030 --> 21:23.240
Let's move.

21:23.323 --> 21:25.200

21:48.640 --> 21:49.725
[tense music playing]

21:49.808 --> 21:50.934
[Cooper] I don't understand.

21:51.476 --> 21:54.563
This says my gun wasn't the murder weapon.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.064
Imagine that.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.650
I can't, because it was. We--

21:58.734 --> 22:01.028
We ran the ballistics. We know the truth.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.612
Yeah, but they don't.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.031
And they never will.

22:05.615 --> 22:08.660
Lew, what did you do?

22:08.744 --> 22:11.455
Nothing that you wouldn't do
if I asked you.

22:11.538 --> 22:13.498
-But I didn't ask.
-Oh.

22:13.582 --> 22:17.169
I performed a little magic on the bore.
That's all you need to know.

22:17.252 --> 22:19.546
And it's more than Heber ever will.

22:19.629 --> 22:20.756
[sighs]

22:20.839 --> 22:22.799
It's one lie built on another.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.260
First, I rope in Charlene, now you.

22:25.343 --> 22:26.970
You didn't rope me in.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.847
All right? I did it because I know you.

22:28.930 --> 22:31.933
-You didn't kill Doug Koster.
-You don't know that.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.310
I don't know that.

22:34.227 --> 22:37.439
I hated that man
because of what he did to my marriage.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.649
At my worst,
who knows what I could have done?

22:40.275 --> 22:44.362
What I know is that innocent people
get convicted all the time.

22:44.446 --> 22:46.865
I wasn't about to let that happen to you.

22:46.948 --> 22:49.743
You feel guilty,
like you're getting away with murder.

22:49.826 --> 22:51.036
But you're not.

22:51.119 --> 22:52.913
Because you're not a murderer.

22:54.998 --> 22:57.542
-Someone killed Koster.
-Yeah, that's right.

22:57.626 --> 22:58.960
And then framed you.

22:59.044 --> 23:03.715
And now that you're in the clear,
it's time to find out who did and why.

23:06.009 --> 23:07.761
It doesn't feel like I'm in the clear.

23:07.844 --> 23:12.265
Hmm. Yeah.
I guess that's why you haven't thanked me.

23:16.853 --> 23:17.938
How'd it work?

23:18.814 --> 23:22.359
You roll up in a van,
dig up some deep-seated trauma,

23:22.442 --> 23:24.361
figure out how to exploit it, then what?

23:24.444 --> 23:26.905
Send your client off
to commit the perfect crime?

23:27.656 --> 23:30.992
Anything I did or didn't say
to my clients is privileged.

23:31.076 --> 23:34.538
Not if you didn't report a crime
you knew they were going to commit

23:34.621 --> 23:37.124
or made them comfortable committing it.

23:37.207 --> 23:40.710
I help my clients be comfortable
in their own skin.

23:40.794 --> 23:44.756
Comfortable? Committing crimes?
Giving in to their darkest impulses?

23:44.840 --> 23:48.260
Everyone has dark impulses, Agent Park.

23:48.760 --> 23:49.886
Even you.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.933
Yeah, ones that, like any normal person,
I hate about myself,

23:55.016 --> 23:58.103
and that I'd hope
a therapist would cure me of.

23:58.186 --> 23:59.229
[Sand] Cure you?

23:59.312 --> 24:02.607
Of what, uh, being who you are?

24:03.316 --> 24:06.361
Why would you want anyone
to cure you of that?

24:09.156 --> 24:13.493
[Raymond] Once I was dead and gone,
I wanted Elizabeth to know everything.

24:13.577 --> 24:19.124
So I gave Dembe the letter
with very specific instructions.

24:20.917 --> 24:22.460
Only when I'm gone.

24:22.544 --> 24:25.255
Give it to Elizabeth,
but only when I'm gone.

24:28.967 --> 24:31.970
Later that night,
Elizabeth was shot and killed.

24:32.679 --> 24:33.597
Okay.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.434
What does that have to do
with whatever happened with Agnes?

24:37.517 --> 24:40.729
The things she said, her mother told her.

24:40.812 --> 24:42.189
But those things,

24:42.731 --> 24:46.818
Elizabeth would never have told her
unless she'd read the letter.

24:47.444 --> 24:48.612
Am I interrupting?

24:48.695 --> 24:51.489
Ah, Vlad! Please, come sit.

24:52.616 --> 24:55.827
-Ah, good to see you again.
-Great to see you.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.121
Weecha, you're in
the presence of greatness.

24:58.205 --> 25:02.834
Vlad is one of the world's
foremost forensic analysts.

25:02.918 --> 25:06.004
I have a finger in a drawer at home.

25:06.087 --> 25:08.215
Would you be able to tell me
who it belongs to?

25:09.216 --> 25:13.845
It would be easier
if you had a head in a box. [laughs]

25:13.929 --> 25:16.514
If you can identify the finger, I will.

25:17.974 --> 25:21.061
Uh... is that why you wanted to see me?

25:21.144 --> 25:25.315
No. Although I'm always intrigued
by streams crossing.

25:25.398 --> 25:27.400
So we'll get you the finger.

25:27.484 --> 25:30.862
But first, this envelope.

25:32.322 --> 25:36.785
I need you to tell me if
Elizabeth Keen's fingerprints are on it.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.119
That's it?

25:38.870 --> 25:40.080
That's all you need?

25:40.163 --> 25:41.373
Besides the finger?

25:41.873 --> 25:45.210
Yes. I've had a copy
of her prints sent to you.

25:45.919 --> 25:46.920
Consider it done.

25:47.545 --> 25:51.091
Out of curiosity,
what answer you are hoping for?

25:51.174 --> 25:53.051
That her prints aren't there.

25:53.635 --> 25:54.469
That I'm...

25:55.887 --> 25:57.347
imagining things.

25:59.307 --> 26:02.519
Sir, we ran her prints, Dr. Sand.

26:02.602 --> 26:05.397
Her name is Eleanor Russo.
She used to be in private practice,

26:05.480 --> 26:09.317
kept up with licensing until
she fell off the grid five years ago.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.695
-Any idea why?
-A theory, yeah. Him.

26:12.445 --> 26:13.655
[Cooper] DeCanio's body man?

26:13.738 --> 26:15.573
Who also happens to be her son.

26:15.657 --> 26:18.827
-What did Sand say about it?
-She hasn't yet. We're about to find out.

26:21.955 --> 26:26.459
I already told the other two,
I won't violate doctor-patient privilege.

26:27.127 --> 26:31.047
I don't want to talk about your patients.
To them, you're Dr. Sand.

26:31.965 --> 26:34.259
It's Eleanor Russo I'm interested in.

26:36.344 --> 26:37.554
Eleanor...

26:38.179 --> 26:40.682
and her son, Dante.

26:41.683 --> 26:45.020
UCLA medical school,
a thriving practice in Philadelphia,

26:45.103 --> 26:47.564
then five years ago, you vanish.

26:47.647 --> 26:50.025
People like you don't vanish.

26:50.525 --> 26:52.235
Not without a good reason.

26:53.611 --> 26:55.238
Is Dante your reason?

27:00.702 --> 27:04.164
I vanished because my marriage fell apart.

27:05.373 --> 27:08.793
Because we fought over Dante...

27:10.337 --> 27:12.213
and the more we fought, the worse he got.

27:12.297 --> 27:15.467
Cutting school,
hanging out with bad people

27:15.550 --> 27:17.385
who introduced him to worse people.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.470
Vito DeCanio.

27:18.553 --> 27:20.638
Yeah, eventually...

27:21.639 --> 27:25.185
but not until after
he'd committed a number of crimes.

27:27.020 --> 27:28.897
Enough to get him arrested.

27:30.440 --> 27:35.111
And that's when Vito stepped in,
to help keep him out of prison.

27:35.195 --> 27:36.821
If you agreed to help him.

27:36.905 --> 27:39.574
He said if I'd counsel his people,

27:39.657 --> 27:41.951
he'd keep Dante out of harm's way.

27:43.953 --> 27:45.663
Today, he broke that deal.

27:47.248 --> 27:50.543
If I help you, will you protect him?

27:50.627 --> 27:52.962
I promise to try to protect you both.

27:53.046 --> 27:56.633
But I'm unable to do that
unless you tell me where Dante is.

27:56.716 --> 28:00.345
We demo and snatch, you drive.
It's teamwork, like the doctor ordered.

28:00.428 --> 28:01.763
As in Dr. Sand?

28:01.846 --> 28:03.932
-Yeah. You seeing her too?
-Me? No.

28:04.015 --> 28:06.601
I tried therapy. Had issues with my mom.

28:06.684 --> 28:07.685
It didn't take.

28:07.769 --> 28:11.981
Well, like Dr. Sand says, "Growth
only happens if you're open to it."

28:12.065 --> 28:14.317
-Maybe you weren't open.
-Yeah. Maybe.

28:14.401 --> 28:16.569
Yo, what time does
the construction crew arrive?

28:16.653 --> 28:19.656
Whenever Vito tells them.
That, he controls.

28:19.739 --> 28:22.534
Wildcard was the preservationist.
She wanted to shut us down.

28:22.617 --> 28:24.744
Would've made
this snatch and grab impossible.

28:24.828 --> 28:25.912
[man] There you go.

28:28.873 --> 28:30.583
You know this is a protection detail,

28:30.667 --> 28:33.086
not a rehearsal
for the World Series of Poker?

28:33.169 --> 28:36.005
[Dante] <i>So this Herman guy,</i>
<i>what's he testifying about?</i>

28:36.089 --> 28:37.966
He's not gonna be testifying.

28:38.049 --> 28:40.969
He'll be crying for his own mama
whenever Vito gets ahold of him.

28:41.052 --> 28:42.470
Now get back to the car.

28:48.852 --> 28:54.065
Couldn't it be a good thing
that Liz knew the truth before she died?

28:56.067 --> 28:56.901
No.

28:57.652 --> 28:58.528
Why not?

28:59.529 --> 29:01.489
Because she knew,
she was able to tell Agnes

29:01.573 --> 29:05.452
how important you were to her
and her to you.

29:06.286 --> 29:09.080
It's why she encouraged
your relationship with Agnes.

29:10.498 --> 29:12.959
What if it's also part of why she died?

29:14.169 --> 29:16.171
[dramatic music playing]

29:18.173 --> 29:19.549
I can't do it.

29:21.426 --> 29:22.510
That's all right.

29:27.348 --> 29:28.641
I don't want to.

29:30.727 --> 29:33.313
Her hesitation, the time it took.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.357
If she hadn't hesitated...

29:38.401 --> 29:39.944
she might have survived.

29:44.240 --> 29:47.535
[Dembe] Eleanor, Dr. Sand,
she says DeCanio has a crew

29:47.619 --> 29:50.413
working a job
at a property he owns downtown.

29:50.497 --> 29:51.539
Working on what?

29:52.123 --> 29:55.543
We've been nibbling at the edges
of the DeCanio syndicate for years.

29:55.627 --> 29:58.922
If she wants a deal, her intel will have
to lead us higher up the food chain.

29:59.005 --> 30:01.382
All she knows is
it's connected to Mary Parrot's death,

30:01.466 --> 30:03.927
it involves her son, and that it's urgent.

30:04.010 --> 30:05.804
Companies associated with the DeCanios

30:05.887 --> 30:09.098
are mid-construction
on two sites we know of downtown,

30:09.182 --> 30:12.143
a luxury hotel and a residential tower.

30:12.811 --> 30:16.356
What's Parrot's connection?
Was there a preservationist objection?

30:16.439 --> 30:17.315
Not to those sites.

30:17.398 --> 30:21.653
Her big push downtown was
to landmark Memorial Baptist Church.

30:21.736 --> 30:24.405
Now, she'd held up developers
who wanted to demolish it.

30:24.489 --> 30:26.699
But now that she's dead,
the sale can go through,

30:26.783 --> 30:30.245
it can be torn down,
and DeCanio is a silent partner.

30:30.328 --> 30:32.038
That's what this is about.

30:32.121 --> 30:34.916
Killing a preservationist
to demolish a church.

30:35.416 --> 30:37.210
We're missing something. What?

30:37.293 --> 30:40.046
There is something else.
When cross-referencing the address,

30:40.129 --> 30:42.882
the building next door
pinged our database.

30:43.424 --> 30:45.468
I recognize it, this church.

30:45.552 --> 30:48.137
I can't remember why. What's the address?

30:48.221 --> 30:50.306
-30 West Oak Street.
-[Park] Oh, my God.

30:50.390 --> 30:54.644
Herman Levy, the informant?
The one testifying against DeCanio.

30:54.727 --> 30:57.564
WITSEC is holding him
at a safe house at 32 West Oak.

30:57.647 --> 31:00.817
-They'll get to him before he testifies.
-[Cooper] Not if we get to him first.

31:00.900 --> 31:04.946
Go. I'll alert the Marshals
and Main Justice about a deal for Sand.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.949
She didn't get us up the food chain,
she got us to the top of it.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.617
Let's hope we're not too late.

31:11.911 --> 31:14.163
[suspenseful music playing]

31:29.637 --> 31:32.390
All right. Third floor, let's move.

31:32.473 --> 31:33.308
Yeah.

31:51.701 --> 31:53.745
-[cell phone ringing]
-[agent exclaims]

31:56.748 --> 31:58.291
[gunfire]

32:03.087 --> 32:03.963
Grab the rat.

32:17.393 --> 32:18.603
[tires screech]

32:20.939 --> 32:23.691
FBI! FBI! Drop your weapons!

32:27.946 --> 32:31.074
Well, this is very confidence-inspiring.

32:31.157 --> 32:32.992
[sirens wailing]

32:34.494 --> 32:35.662
Dante Russo?

32:36.704 --> 32:37.747
I have the son.

32:41.918 --> 32:44.504
Dr. Sand is in custody. She and her son.

32:44.587 --> 32:46.547
-And DeCanio?
<i>-He's been arrested.</i>

32:46.631 --> 32:48.466
<i>The doctor's son worked for him as well.</i>

32:48.549 --> 32:50.718
Both are set
to be transferred to Main Justice

32:50.802 --> 32:54.639
to sign immunity agreements in exchange
for everything they know about DeCanio.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.350
Have you spoken with Agnes yet?

32:57.433 --> 32:59.519
Did she say
whether she had a good time or not?

32:59.602 --> 33:02.271
She said that you, and I quote,

33:02.355 --> 33:04.107
"suck at state capitals."

33:04.190 --> 33:07.777
<i>Which I took to mean</i>
<i>a good time was had by all.</i>

33:07.860 --> 33:08.695
Yes.

33:08.778 --> 33:10.822
<i>You're doing well with her. I'm impressed.</i>

33:10.905 --> 33:13.116
And hopeful that, like me,

33:13.616 --> 33:17.495
you're finding that being around her
helps in every way.

33:20.498 --> 33:23.167
What about Sand? What do you think?

33:23.251 --> 33:26.379
You know her story now,
you've questioned her.

33:26.462 --> 33:29.007
Do you think DeCanio
was right to hire her?

33:29.090 --> 33:31.551
<i>I do. She's smart and thoughtful.</i>

33:31.634 --> 33:33.636
<i>I'm not surprised</i>
<i>with the results she got.</i>

33:35.096 --> 33:37.432
We're gonna testify against Vito?

33:37.515 --> 33:40.018
After he sent me to kidnap
a witness in federal custody,

33:40.101 --> 33:42.353
we're signing up to be federal witnesses?

33:42.437 --> 33:44.022
We both know it's the only way out.

33:44.105 --> 33:46.524
What we know is there's no way out.

33:47.150 --> 33:51.738
He's using you now for dangerous jobs.
I can't protect you anymore.

33:51.821 --> 33:53.281
You think the feds can?

33:53.364 --> 33:55.366
-[tires screech]
-Hey.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.702
-Hey. Hello?
-[officer] What was that?

33:57.785 --> 33:59.787
-[Sand] What is it? What's going on?
-It's him.

33:59.871 --> 34:02.582
-Hey! Hello?
-[Dante] Mom. Mom.

34:03.207 --> 34:05.001
-It's him.
-[man] Give me the keys.

34:05.084 --> 34:05.960
[banging on door]

34:06.044 --> 34:08.588
[suspenseful music playing]

34:13.217 --> 34:14.761
Dr. Sand, I presume?

34:15.386 --> 34:17.805
-You're Raymond Reddington.
-Did DeCanio send you?

34:17.889 --> 34:19.140
Vito's been detained.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.225
I'm here of my own volition
with a proposal.

34:21.309 --> 34:22.685
Would you care to hear it?

34:28.107 --> 34:30.109
[grim music playing]

34:33.488 --> 34:37.033
Vito DeCanio. Welcome to federal custody.

34:37.116 --> 34:39.911
Been here twice. For a total of six hours.

34:39.994 --> 34:41.746
[Aram] Well, third time's a charm.

34:43.331 --> 34:44.373
Where are they?

34:44.457 --> 34:46.459
-You heard me. Where are they?
-[Cooper] Agent Park.

34:46.542 --> 34:48.377
-Where did you take them?
-Alina, hey.

34:48.461 --> 34:51.339
He hit the convoy with Dr. Sand.
She and her son, they're gone.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.257
I got no idea what you're talking about.

34:53.341 --> 34:55.760
-If you did anything to her--
-Okay, stop.

34:58.679 --> 35:02.266
-If you did anything, we'll find out.
-I didn't do anything.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.727
But I'm in debt to the person who did.

35:06.395 --> 35:07.939
Take him to Interrogation.

35:11.150 --> 35:12.902
Your personal therapist?

35:13.653 --> 35:17.990
Yes. For which you'll be well paid
and safe from harm.

35:18.074 --> 35:20.701
-You said DeCanio has been arrested.
-[Raymond] He has.

35:20.785 --> 35:24.372
But he has friends in high places.

35:24.997 --> 35:26.749
Just not as high as me.

35:27.542 --> 35:31.129
I helped him to protect my son.
Why should I help you?

35:33.381 --> 35:34.715
I need your help.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.551
[poignant music playing]

35:36.634 --> 35:40.638
And what I do, my professional life,

35:40.721 --> 35:42.640
you will not be a part of that.

35:43.599 --> 35:46.477
Helping you personally
helps you professionally.

35:46.561 --> 35:48.938
That's how this process works.

35:50.731 --> 35:52.525
Just give me three months.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.111
On the island of your choice.

35:55.653 --> 36:00.408
At the end of which you're free to go.
I hope you won't, but it'll be up to you.

36:01.075 --> 36:03.161
Consider it a palate cleanser.

36:03.244 --> 36:08.875
A transition from a distasteful past
to a delightfully piquant future.

36:09.834 --> 36:10.793
Why me?

36:16.007 --> 36:20.428
The details of my story
are not for the faint of heart.

36:20.511 --> 36:22.263
Based on your history,

36:22.346 --> 36:25.099
I believe you can stomach
pretty much anything.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.475
I'm not a miracle worker.

36:26.559 --> 36:29.437
No need. I already have one of those.

36:30.897 --> 36:32.857
Let's talk islands.

36:39.780 --> 36:40.698
Headache?

36:41.574 --> 36:42.450
No.

36:43.367 --> 36:44.535
Embarrassment.

36:45.077 --> 36:46.245
For what?

36:46.829 --> 36:49.665
For losing it on DeCanio?
Pfft. Come on, I understand.

36:49.749 --> 36:52.418
This job...
This job can get under your skin.

36:53.586 --> 36:55.588
[melancholy music playing]

36:57.298 --> 36:58.257
It's hard

36:58.341 --> 37:00.718
being someone who crosses lines.

37:00.801 --> 37:03.721
People judge you for it,
so you judge yourself.

37:08.768 --> 37:11.938
Dr. Sand is right.
We all have dark impulses.

37:12.730 --> 37:16.150
And most of the time,
there is no cure for them.

37:16.234 --> 37:19.153
So the idea,
at least the idea I came up with

37:19.237 --> 37:23.282
after spending my grandparents'
entire inheritance on therapy...

37:24.951 --> 37:28.579
is to not hate yourself
because you have dark impulses,

37:29.622 --> 37:31.499
but to love yourself in spite of them.

37:34.835 --> 37:36.379
How big was your inheritance?

37:36.462 --> 37:38.631
$86,749.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.843
I'd say it was money well spent.

37:47.014 --> 37:50.351
[Raymond over phone] <i>Harold, I hope you're</i>
<i>right about the good doctor's efficacy.</i>

37:50.434 --> 37:51.394
Sand?

37:52.353 --> 37:53.312
You took her.

37:53.396 --> 37:56.440
"Took" is a bit strong.
But, yes, she has agreed to work with me.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.526
Instead of testifying against DeCanio?

37:58.609 --> 38:02.196
There'll be plenty of testifying
against him before it gets around to her.

38:02.280 --> 38:06.951
Hopefully, by then, I'll be a better man,
and she won't be so frightened.

38:08.035 --> 38:09.161
Gotta fly, Harold.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.212
Cvetko?

38:18.296 --> 38:19.463
He has called.

38:20.047 --> 38:21.257
The prints match.

38:21.799 --> 38:24.176
[tense music playing]

38:37.606 --> 38:39.025
[Raymond] Dr. Sand?

38:40.818 --> 38:42.028
We should talk.

38:47.283 --> 38:49.285
[covers rustling]

39:02.965 --> 39:05.926
I told myself I wasn't honest with you
because if you found out

39:06.010 --> 39:08.846
the truth about me, about who I was...

39:10.014 --> 39:11.891
you wouldn't like what you saw.

39:12.516 --> 39:16.771
But the truth is, I wasn't honest
because I didn't like what I saw.

39:17.563 --> 39:19.315
It adds up to the same thing.

39:19.398 --> 39:21.400
[poignant music playing]

39:24.820 --> 39:28.240
I couldn't expect you to love me
when I didn't love myself.

39:30.242 --> 39:33.162
So that's what I'm gonna try and do.

39:34.705 --> 39:36.374
Learn to love myself.

39:38.125 --> 39:39.960
Then maybe you'll love me too.

39:52.264 --> 39:54.266
[cell phone ringing]

40:01.690 --> 40:02.650
Harold Cooper.

40:02.733 --> 40:05.778
[distorted voice over speakerphone]
<i>I texted a photo. Look at it.</i>

40:06.821 --> 40:07.696
Who is this?

40:07.780 --> 40:09.073
<i>Look at it.</i>

40:09.156 --> 40:11.575
[suspenseful music playing]

40:13.411 --> 40:14.954
<i>There's audio too.</i>

40:15.037 --> 40:18.582
<i>Of you and your friend evidence-tampering.</i>

40:21.001 --> 40:23.087
-What do you want?
<i>-So much.</i>

40:23.170 --> 40:26.715
<i>And with what I know about you</i>
<i>and the murder of Doug Koster,</i>

40:26.799 --> 40:29.844
<i>I'm confident</i>
<i>you're going to give it to me.</i>

40:29.927 --> 40:31.846
[somber music playing]

40:31.929 --> 40:35.015
I found peace and tranquility

40:35.099 --> 40:38.477
and a real feeling of...

40:42.523 --> 40:43.566
quiet.

40:46.026 --> 40:47.695
Yet I abandoned it...

40:49.196 --> 40:53.534
out of this compulsion
for chaos and peril.

40:58.330 --> 41:00.332
I had found light.

41:04.336 --> 41:06.297
Yet I'm compelled by the dark.

41:10.968 --> 41:12.261
It animates me.

41:13.179 --> 41:15.264
So much so that I drag others into it.

41:16.307 --> 41:19.185
Others that I care desperately about.

41:22.897 --> 41:24.690
So, what is the purpose...

41:25.733 --> 41:29.737
if I'm willing to risk
everything good in my life,

41:30.237 --> 41:35.409
to even defend risking it
as necessary or just,

41:36.035 --> 41:40.206
when I know the result...

41:41.540 --> 41:43.042
will only be...

41:47.963 --> 41:49.798
a deepening darkness?

41:53.219 --> 41:57.681
Tell me, where is this
coming from right now?

41:58.182 --> 41:59.391
Why now?

42:05.022 --> 42:09.360
I recently discovered that I was betrayed
by my oldest and closest friend.

42:12.530 --> 42:15.866
I'm apprehensive about the depth
and breadth of my anger.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.540
