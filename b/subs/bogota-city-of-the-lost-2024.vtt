Hey, Sergeant Park!

01:43.645 --> 01:46.189
No, I'm not at Gimpo. I'm at El Dorado.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.235
Yeah, this place is really far.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.822
Give me the address first.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.907

01:59.410 --> 02:00.787
Sir, allow us to search you.

02:02.330 --> 02:05.792
You don't think I'll be able to get a cab?
Come on, it's an airport. Yeah?

02:12.757 --> 02:15.134
Look over there.
They're beating people up.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.345
No!

It looks like there's been an accident.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.367
We won't be here for long.
Everything's ready.

02:40.368 --> 02:41.995
Just trust your old man.

02:42.787 --> 02:45.998
Let's think of this place as a tollgate.

- I'll clean it well.
- You should ask first!

03:35.965 --> 03:39.718
- You'll scratch it!
- Eat shit and die, asshole!

03:39.719 --> 03:40.886

- What was that?
- Hey, not my bag!

Have you forgotten?

06:45.071 --> 06:46.072
Don't you remember?

- No, that was...

Yeah, you.

<i>They see Sergeant Park as family.

Why are you skipping the retreats?

07:49.844 --> 07:53.848
<i>Anyone bringing in goods from Korea

<i>That's how he became

10:49.690 --> 10:52.318
<i>He became more bitter after coming here,</i>

10:52.860 --> 10:55.237
<i>and he grew more distant
from the other Koreans.</i>

10:56.238 --> 10:59.658

10:59.659 --> 11:00.867

12:07.977 --> 12:12.356
Frankly, you're not even going to check
if there's armed security anyway.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.234
That bastard Soo-young

12:16.235 --> 12:19.447

12:20.531 --> 12:23.325
Are you frustrated?
Then why don't you go over there?

12:24.368 --> 12:26.078
Yeah, that should do it, right?

12:26.579 --> 12:30.249
Rebels or customs,
you can deal with them all. How about it?

12:31.709 --> 12:34.085
Why are you bringing me into this?

12:34.086 --> 12:35.504
Because you're my nephew.

12:36.505 --> 12:38.132
For fuck's sake.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.675
What I'm saying is

Hey, don't.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.518
- These disrespectful bastards!
- Father.

- Hey!

12:52.104 --> 12:53.063
Father.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.148
- Are you okay, Father?
- Yeah.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.941

13:07.578 --> 13:08.912
Yeah, hit me hard.

13:08.913 --> 13:11.165
- Emilio!
- Hard!

13:19.006 --> 13:20.466
How much will be enough?

13:34.522 --> 13:35.898
So you just turned 22?

13:37.858 --> 13:38.818
An early birthday.

13:40.903 --> 13:41.987
An early birthday?

13:43.030 --> 13:44.406
I have an early birthday too.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.662
I was your exact age
when I came to this country.

13:50.996 --> 13:54.374
After the military,
I took every penny I saved in Vietnam,

13:54.375 --> 13:57.919
went to Pyeonghwa Market
to buy all the lingerie,

13:57.920 --> 14:01.756
like women's bras and panties,
and brought them all to Colombia.

14:01.757 --> 14:03.259
Hey, Cuca!

14:05.386 --> 14:06.637
Alejandro!

14:08.013 --> 14:10.057
- How are you, my friend?
- My friend!

14:10.641 --> 14:13.519
<i>Alejandro, the head
of the Colombia Merchants Association.</i>

14:14.019 --> 14:16.104
<i>He's close with the authorities in Bogot√°</i>

<i>and, according to rumors,

14:19.733 --> 14:21.443
<i>Those two are business partners</i>

14:21.944 --> 14:23.404
<i>and inseparable best friends.</i>

14:26.073 --> 14:28.826
Why is that bastard
trying to sweet-talk me, huh?

14:29.410 --> 14:31.412
Still calling me a <i>cuca</i> at my age?

14:32.997 --> 14:34.248
Where were we?

14:35.040 --> 14:36.457
Women's lingerie...

14:36.458 --> 14:37.876
Yes, the lingerie.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.838
At first, I was selling it
on the streets around Medell√≠n.

14:41.547 --> 14:44.049
But the local bastards
would follow me around,

14:44.550 --> 14:47.594
grinning and singing whenever I walked by
with my bundle on my back.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.721
<i>La cucaracha</i>, <i>la cuca...</i>

14:49.722 --> 14:50.931
Christ.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.808
Even after I set up shop,
they still came singing.

14:53.809 --> 14:55.895
<i>La cucaracha</i>, <i>la cucaracha...</i>

14:56.687 --> 14:57.521

14:58.063 --> 15:00.566
Hey, do you know
what <i>"la cucaracha"</i> means?

15:01.567 --> 15:02.401
Yes.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.361
A cockroach.

15:09.658 --> 15:10.492
Kook-hee.

15:11.243 --> 15:12.077
Yes?

15:12.578 --> 15:13.537
I can just tell.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.165
You're different.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.628
You're different from your father
and the other Koreans here.

15:21.295 --> 15:22.129
You know?

15:25.341 --> 15:26.800
I'm saying you're trustworthy.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.720
You're someone who can be trusted.

15:30.721 --> 15:31.889
You've got grit too.

15:43.108 --> 15:46.736
Why did your father give you a name
that sounds like "cookie"?

15:46.737 --> 15:49.073
So easy to make fun of.

15:49.698 --> 15:50.615
How about this?

15:50.616 --> 15:54.244
You're Cookie, and I'm Cream.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.290
We'll make a hell of a team, bro.

16:42.584 --> 16:43.419

16:44.044 --> 16:45.878
I work for Mr. Park Jang-su. I'm Song--

16:45.879 --> 16:47.214
For fuck's sake.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.175
Why can't he just trust me?

16:51.135 --> 16:53.262
Lil' Peck sent you? That Little Park?

16:55.222 --> 16:56.431
There's no armed security.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.099
Red alert lifted.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.185
So I sent the security back.

17:01.228 --> 17:02.646
Am I a fool or something?

17:04.189 --> 17:05.607

18:25.145 --> 18:27.648
I asked for some documents.

18:28.315 --> 18:29.148
<i>But...</i>

18:29.149 --> 18:30.066
Understood.

18:41.703 --> 18:42.538
Got it.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.726
It means someone died there.

19:12.067 --> 19:14.611
People believe those will send
the poor souls to heaven.

19:17.447 --> 19:19.783
No, I'm good.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.624
Do you know
how many bodies are buried there?

19:29.918 --> 19:32.379
Stop being a bitch and try it.
You'll relax instantly.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.966
- Take it.
- No. Illegal in Korea. No.

19:38.385 --> 19:39.803

Whatever.

19:47.394 --> 19:51.105

- Shit, it's the fucking customs guys.

19:51.106 --> 19:52.315
What is it?

19:52.316 --> 19:53.358
Wait here.

19:54.234 --> 19:55.861
Hey!

19:58.530 --> 19:59.740
- Afternoon!

20:03.035 --> 20:04.285

20:14.588 --> 20:16.589
- This is Kook-hee.
<i>- What?</i>

20:16.590 --> 20:19.508
A car came by, but I'm not sure
if it's the police or customs.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.180

Okay.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.104
Get out.

20:31.855 --> 20:33.106
- Go away.
- Out.

24:06.069 --> 24:07.612
It's not granite.

24:08.405 --> 24:09.614
What does that mean?

24:11.575 --> 24:14.660
It means this country's emeralds
are the finest.

24:14.661 --> 24:15.578
Hey, come here.

24:15.579 --> 24:18.581
They are pure emeralds, in essence.

24:18.582 --> 24:21.000
But how do you get this
out of the country?

24:21.001 --> 24:22.084
- How?
- Yeah.

24:22.085 --> 24:24.879
Just hide them and leave!
What's the problem?

24:24.880 --> 24:26.464
So naive.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.381

you're not doing acupuncture anymore?

- Panties?

24:42.731 --> 24:43.648
You know, he...

24:44.983 --> 24:48.194
- He's cute.
- My uncle really likes guys like him.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.361
The reckless type.

24:49.362 --> 24:52.615
<i>Little Park. He bought a club in the city.</i>

24:52.616 --> 24:57.912
You need to get on his good side.
Little Park owns three shops.

24:57.913 --> 25:02.208
He's got three shops and three lovers.
And they're all local girls.

25:02.209 --> 25:04.585
I heard your club in the city
is doing well.

25:04.586 --> 25:07.129
If it's Korean-style,
I'd be curious to see it.

25:07.130 --> 25:09.798
You're so curious
about everything at your age.

25:09.799 --> 25:12.093
- Jae-ung, bring a chair.
- A chair?

25:13.220 --> 25:14.179
Hey, have a seat.

25:15.138 --> 25:16.306
Let me pour you one.

25:18.892 --> 25:20.810
- Just drop by sometime.
- Okay.

Hey, that's right!

25:30.070 --> 25:32.364
As of today,
you're a Korea University alum.

25:33.448 --> 25:34.449
All right!

25:35.742 --> 25:37.661
- What are you doing?
- Korea University!

25:38.411 --> 25:39.995
<i>Soo-young, a Korea University grad,</i>

<i>When Korea's IMF crisis
shut down the expat branch,</i>

25:45.293 --> 25:48.504
<i>he started helping Sergeant Park

25:48.505 --> 25:50.006
Call me bro from now on.

Are you fucking kidding me?
"Bro"? The kid barely knows you.

25:55.387 --> 25:56.929
What is this, a reunion?

25:56.930 --> 25:59.265
Why did you bring all your lackeys?

25:59.266 --> 26:01.392
By the way, listen up, all of you.

26:01.393 --> 26:04.603
Cause a scene in my club again,
and you're dead.

26:04.604 --> 26:07.940
These poor students left home
to study so far away.

26:07.941 --> 26:11.068
They can come to Korean gatherings, right?
They don't even eat much.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.070
Go back and dig in.

26:12.654 --> 26:15.699
All right, fine.
You take care of your fellow countrymen.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.243
Keep them in line when they're drinking.

26:19.035 --> 26:20.120
"Keep them in line"?

26:21.288 --> 26:22.831
Right, keep them in line.

26:23.999 --> 26:27.835
Little Park, you sent this kid
to keep me in line, didn't you?

26:27.836 --> 26:31.214
If you don't fucking trust me,
come do it yourself, Lil' Peck.

26:31.715 --> 26:33.507
You're always up my fucking ass.

26:33.508 --> 26:35.301
What the fuck? "Lil' Peck"?

26:35.302 --> 26:37.845
- Sorry about that.
- How dare you talk to me like that!

26:37.846 --> 26:39.179
- How old are you?
- Sorry.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.389
- Come on.
- Why push him?

26:40.390 --> 26:41.765
- Sit down.
- Come here!

26:41.766 --> 26:43.809
- What?
- Hey! Seriously, sit down.

26:43.810 --> 26:46.271
You fuckers are pissing me off,
for fuck's sake!

26:52.152 --> 26:53.320
Why not flip the table?

26:53.903 --> 26:55.447
That bastard Soo-young started it!

26:56.031 --> 26:57.115
Go home, all of you.

26:58.033 --> 26:58.950
Let's wrap it up.

27:03.330 --> 27:04.205
Well?

27:05.165 --> 27:06.291
Turn the music off!

27:07.417 --> 27:08.418
For fuck's sake.

27:12.672 --> 27:14.049
Call me Uncle from now on.

27:14.758 --> 27:15.592
Pardon?

27:16.092 --> 27:16.926
It's okay.

27:17.802 --> 27:20.597
Your father and I were once comrades
who shed blood together.

27:21.181 --> 27:23.433
I will later, boss.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.145
Sure.

27:29.230 --> 27:30.398
No rush.

27:34.277 --> 27:37.322
In Buddhism,
there's a concept called the "Six Paths."

27:38.406 --> 27:40.950
It means all beings cycle
through the six worlds,

27:41.451 --> 27:44.203
from the lowest on the ground
to the highest in the sky,

27:44.204 --> 27:46.373
based on their karma.

27:47.082 --> 27:50.376
And this country
is the embodiment of that.

27:50.377 --> 27:55.090
From Zone 1, where you live,
to Zones 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

27:56.758 --> 27:58.843
Right now, we're in Zone 6.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.347
Only the rich live here.

28:05.809 --> 28:06.768
Do you drink?

28:07.894 --> 28:08.728
Yes.

28:15.068 --> 28:16.945
But to climb all the way up here,

28:17.821 --> 28:18.821
you need more.

28:18.822 --> 28:21.491
Just blindly working hard isn't enough.

28:22.158 --> 28:23.243
You know that, right?

28:37.215 --> 28:38.091
Very well.

28:40.301 --> 28:43.096
Dear nephew, I want you to survive
and make it all the way

28:43.596 --> 28:44.889
here to Zone 6.

28:52.605 --> 28:56.443
<i>That day, for the first time,

29:11.916 --> 29:13.625

29:13.626 --> 29:15.545
What the fuck? Hurry up!

29:20.842 --> 29:21.885
See you, JP.

29:28.475 --> 29:29.642
- Evening!
- Hey, wow.

29:32.729 --> 29:35.398
- I missed you, my friend.
- Yeah.

29:37.192 --> 29:40.820
<i>As the scale of the smuggling grew
and the number of trucks increased,</i>

29:41.696 --> 29:43.323
<i>our wallets got fatter too.</i>

30:09.182 --> 30:11.016
- Pass.
- Come on, count it as a goal.

30:11.017 --> 30:12.519

30:30.787 --> 30:32.831

30:33.331 --> 30:34.331
Sounds good.

30:34.332 --> 30:36.625
- Hey, good work.
- Stop! Don't touch my hair.

30:36.626 --> 30:37.751
- Good work.
- Don't!

30:37.752 --> 30:41.004
Why not?
I'm saying you did a good job. Hey!

30:41.005 --> 30:43.466
Don't spray that at me, you little shit!

30:52.976 --> 30:54.017
What's your name?

30:54.018 --> 30:55.103
Carla.

30:55.728 --> 30:57.437
- Kook-hee.
- Cookie?

30:57.438 --> 30:59.357
- Jump!
- Jump!

31:07.031 --> 31:09.659
Look at that! Isn't it nice?

31:10.243 --> 31:12.537
Right? It's heaven!

31:21.170 --> 31:22.672
Hey, isn't that Kook-hee?

31:25.300 --> 31:26.801
Why's he with that group?

31:28.136 --> 31:32.348
Why else? That fucker Soo-young
is keeping him close.

31:34.142 --> 31:37.770
As for Soo-young,
he handles the customs work for Mr. Park.

31:38.813 --> 31:41.900
There are many eyes on him,
so it's awkward for him to get involved.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.068
- Right? Kook-hee.
- Yeah?

31:45.069 --> 31:47.238
This is my first business,

31:48.114 --> 31:49.781
so please help me out.

31:49.782 --> 31:50.950
You get me, right?

31:51.618 --> 31:52.826
Get what, Jae-ung?

31:52.827 --> 31:55.496
See if you can do it
without Sergeant Park's help.

31:58.166 --> 32:00.335
Come on, that's just not true.

32:01.044 --> 32:04.088
We can manage
without Sergeant Park's help.

32:05.423 --> 32:06.549
Besides, this is...

32:09.594 --> 32:10.428
Hey.

32:11.220 --> 32:12.971
This is Soo-young's plan.

32:12.972 --> 32:14.349
Don't you know him?

32:21.314 --> 32:23.231
You'll need to get your own shop too.

32:23.232 --> 32:24.943
How long are you going to carry on

32:25.985 --> 32:27.528
being someone else's errand boy?

32:36.287 --> 32:37.163
Jae-ung.

32:38.081 --> 32:40.458
How long do you think
I'll be an errand boy?

32:41.209 --> 32:42.794
Huh? How long?

32:44.837 --> 32:45.880
Errand boy, my ass.

32:59.227 --> 33:00.478
Okay.

33:11.489 --> 33:12.532
Fuck you.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.575
- Piss off.
- Who do you think you are?

33:15.576 --> 33:17.620
- What, fucker? Son of a bitch!
- What?

33:18.663 --> 33:20.039
You motherfucker.

33:24.168 --> 33:26.753
Don't worry about me.
Worry about yourself.

33:26.754 --> 33:28.381
Well, I'm just trying to...

33:30.008 --> 33:31.009
What's going on?

33:34.846 --> 33:35.680
Sang-mook!

33:37.223 --> 33:38.390
Stop, you dog!

33:38.391 --> 33:39.558
You son of a bitch!

33:39.559 --> 33:41.518
- What's going on?
- Stop.

33:41.519 --> 33:42.686
Out of my way, damn it.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.312
Come here, you bastard.

33:44.313 --> 33:47.567
Come at me!
I'll kill you all, you sons of bitches!

33:48.860 --> 33:49.986
Let go!

33:51.654 --> 33:52.655
You motherfucker!

34:02.749 --> 34:05.168
Jae-ung! Hey, you son of a bitch!

34:06.377 --> 34:07.670
Fuck.

34:18.931 --> 34:20.600
Shut up, everybody. Damn it.

34:21.642 --> 34:22.518
Shut up, everybody.

34:24.562 --> 34:26.105
I said shut up, everybody!

34:33.905 --> 34:36.908
Hey, what's going on?
What's with this fucked-up situation?

34:45.208 --> 34:46.459
It's an unloaded gun?

34:47.376 --> 34:48.544
Jesus Christ.

34:53.800 --> 34:57.720
Why don't you ask the bastard
who started this fucked-up situation?

35:04.477 --> 35:06.229
Llama .38.

35:06.771 --> 35:09.690
This should be
in a police officer's holster.

35:10.399 --> 35:13.111
Why was he waving it around?

35:17.532 --> 35:18.449
You're here.

35:19.492 --> 35:21.576
Man, you fucking morons.

35:21.577 --> 35:23.996
Seriously, you guys
have really embarrassed me.

35:24.831 --> 35:26.457
Also, you get into a fight

35:27.875 --> 35:29.043
only to get beaten up?

35:30.002 --> 35:31.837
Here, this will help you shit better.

35:31.838 --> 35:34.256
It's good for the kidneys
and stops gray hair too.

35:34.257 --> 35:35.340
Wow!

35:35.341 --> 35:37.342
It isn't booze, then. It's medicine.

35:37.343 --> 35:39.762
Are you really going to sell these?

35:40.263 --> 35:43.348
This country has spring weather
365 days a year.

35:43.349 --> 35:44.891
How can you sell down parkas?

35:44.892 --> 35:47.894
Exactly, it's like selling heaters
in the Tatacoa Desert

35:47.895 --> 35:49.813
and refrigerators in the South Pole.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.983
Have you ever been to a desert?

35:52.859 --> 35:54.484
- Have you been to Tatacoa?
- Not yet.

35:54.485 --> 35:56.570
The desert becomes freezing at night.

35:56.571 --> 35:57.487
I see.

35:57.488 --> 35:58.530
And the South Pole?

35:58.531 --> 36:01.575
Do people only eat frozen food there,
not refrigerated food?

36:01.576 --> 36:03.910
A refrigerator's key part
is its cooling section.

36:03.911 --> 36:05.495
Cold feels way colder in spring.

36:05.496 --> 36:07.164
It's like reverse thinking, right?

36:07.165 --> 36:08.373
Oh! That's right!

36:08.374 --> 36:10.918
Sergeant Park just sells stuff.

36:11.460 --> 36:13.003
What I'm selling is a new concept.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.671
A new fucking concept.

36:14.672 --> 36:17.257
Look at this.
It's light, and it looks cool, right?

36:17.258 --> 36:18.592
These will sell for sure.

36:18.593 --> 36:19.886
Hey, you bastard!

36:20.970 --> 36:22.763
Don't touch that. It's valuable.

36:26.684 --> 36:28.186
You don't get to sit either!

36:31.314 --> 36:32.148
Sit.

36:35.776 --> 36:38.653
You can easily hire a <i>sicario</i>
for 100,000 won in this country.

36:38.654 --> 36:40.072
Why'd you pull a gun?

36:41.073 --> 36:42.700
Because we're in Colombia.

36:45.912 --> 36:48.873
I wish you guys were even
half as good as Kook-hee.

36:49.498 --> 36:52.667
You're always saying
Kook-hee this, Kook-hee that.

36:52.668 --> 36:55.045
But honestly,
I'm two years older than him,

36:55.046 --> 36:57.422
and when you keep comparing me to him,

36:57.423 --> 37:00.175
it really hurts my feelings, you know.

37:00.176 --> 37:02.844
Soo-young, Kook-hee's younger than me,

37:02.845 --> 37:04.054
but he speaks unclearly,

37:04.055 --> 37:06.223
sometimes using honorifics
and sometimes not,

37:06.224 --> 37:07.850
which really annoys me.

37:08.976 --> 37:11.229
But he's not a bad person or anything.

37:20.696 --> 37:24.116
I was told to return this to you.
He said you'd understand.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.338
Hey, have a drink too.

37:38.381 --> 37:40.967
Helps you shit better,
boosts stamina, and stops graying.

37:45.554 --> 37:48.557
Kid, do you trust Park Jang-su?

37:51.143 --> 37:53.688
Cuca!

37:54.814 --> 37:57.733
<i>La cucaracha, la cucaracha</i>

37:58.651 --> 38:00.610
<i>Di-ri-ri-ri</i>

38:00.611 --> 38:02.655
That's what everybody calls him.

38:06.075 --> 38:11.289
Hey, did he also tell you that story
about how he smuggled panties in blankets?

38:13.165 --> 38:15.626
Fuck, man. It's all lies.

38:17.336 --> 38:19.045
<i>He went to Peru as a chicken sexer,</i>

38:19.046 --> 38:22.133
<i>landed himself in trouble,
and ended up in Colombia.</i>

38:23.217 --> 38:24.676
Have you ever heard of anyone

38:24.677 --> 38:27.679
who started out working
under Park Jang-su and succeeded?

38:27.680 --> 38:28.597
No one.

38:29.598 --> 38:32.017
First, he gives you his trust,
then he uses you.

38:32.018 --> 38:35.396
Once you're no longer useful,
you're nothing to him.

38:39.025 --> 38:39.900
Hey, Kook-hee.

38:40.693 --> 38:43.404
Why do you care so much about him, Uncle?

38:43.988 --> 38:44.988
Let's be real.

38:44.989 --> 38:47.741
He wants to sell parkas here.
You think that'll work?

38:47.742 --> 38:48.826
In South America?

38:50.661 --> 38:52.829
This is why you're so thick.

38:52.830 --> 38:55.707
- What do you mean?
- Why wouldn't they sell?

38:55.708 --> 38:58.127
They're light, warm, stylish, and new.

38:58.711 --> 38:59.545
Aren't they?

39:01.130 --> 39:02.715
Look at the way you're dressed.

39:03.466 --> 39:06.802
What would you know about fashion?
All you know is women's panties.

39:07.845 --> 39:08.804
Anyway,

39:09.764 --> 39:13.142
if we seize
that bastard Soo-young's first shipment,

39:13.893 --> 39:15.811
he won't be able to react immediately.

39:16.312 --> 39:17.146
Is that it?

39:17.688 --> 39:20.441
Meanwhile,
we target Soo-young's factory in China,

39:20.941 --> 39:22.567
outbid him, and take over.

39:22.568 --> 39:23.611
Okay.

39:25.863 --> 39:28.240
<i>You think you can make it out of Zone 1?</i>

39:29.533 --> 39:31.619
No, you never will.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.288
By the way,

39:35.206 --> 39:37.291
why did you send Kook-hee to Soo-young?

39:41.170 --> 39:42.338
We gotta test him.

39:43.756 --> 39:44.673
Test Soo-young?

39:45.591 --> 39:46.634
No, Kook-hee.

39:52.056 --> 39:52.890
Kook-hee? Why?

39:55.059 --> 39:58.854
Soo-young will have to get his goods
to Bogot√° somehow.

39:59.563 --> 40:02.233
So who do you think
he'll try to lure to his side?

40:08.197 --> 40:09.698
You don't trust Kook-hee, do you?

40:11.700 --> 40:13.285
You actually trust people?

40:13.953 --> 40:14.787
Me?

40:15.287 --> 40:16.747
I trust you, Uncle.

40:18.165 --> 40:19.999
- You trust me?
- Shit yeah. Amen.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.793
Oh my, I'm so grateful.

40:21.794 --> 40:24.713
Fucking bullshit.
You're better off fooling a corpse, punk.

40:26.841 --> 40:27.716
Hey, yeah.

40:28.926 --> 40:31.052
So did you return the package?

40:31.053 --> 40:31.971
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

40:32.680 --> 40:35.099
And Soo-young didn't say much?

40:35.724 --> 40:37.810
<i>He asked me if I trust you, boss.</i>

40:38.436 --> 40:40.646
Come on, I told you to call me Uncle.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.107
So?

40:43.691 --> 40:44.775
Do you trust me?

40:46.235 --> 40:48.571
I said I can put food on the table,
thanks to you.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.239
<i>Anything else?</i>

40:52.074 --> 40:53.075
<i>No, nothing else.</i>

40:53.951 --> 40:54.785
Nothing else?

40:57.746 --> 40:58.747
<i>You hold on to this.</i>

41:02.960 --> 41:04.712
It'll come in handy someday.

41:07.214 --> 41:08.883
<i>This is Colombia, after all.</i>

41:19.435 --> 41:22.938
That bastard Soo-young will mix his goods
with ours at customs this time.

41:23.647 --> 41:25.900
They'll be the boxes
with the orange stickers.

41:28.110 --> 41:30.279
<i>Kook-hee, your job is to bring them to me.</i>

41:32.823 --> 41:34.450
Can I make you a proposition?

41:40.164 --> 41:42.249
<i>Remember. The orange stickers.</i>

41:48.881 --> 41:49.798
Here.

42:14.532 --> 42:15.366
<i>Oh, Miguel.</i>

42:16.033 --> 42:19.495
<i>If Kook-hee takes off
with one of the trucks, turn a blind eye.</i>

42:21.372 --> 42:23.707
Because Soo-young's goods
have blue stickers.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.045
<i>The orange stickers aren't important.</i>

42:36.428 --> 42:38.180
He'll test you.

42:38.847 --> 42:40.349
You don't trust Kook-hee, do you?

42:41.267 --> 42:42.810
You actually trust people?

42:44.353 --> 42:46.688
Fuck that. Who can be trusted?

42:46.689 --> 42:48.315
Have I ever told you to trust me?

42:49.233 --> 42:50.734
Just trust yourself.

43:02.830 --> 43:03.830
You fucking bastard!

43:03.831 --> 43:04.831
Son of bitches.

43:04.832 --> 43:06.625
What the hell are you doing?

43:12.464 --> 43:13.299
Soo-young.

43:15.509 --> 43:16.510
Kook-hee!

43:20.556 --> 43:21.515
Shit, man.

43:22.349 --> 43:23.183
Good work.

43:23.851 --> 43:24.810
Okay? Good work.

43:26.145 --> 43:28.230
- It's hot, isn't it?
- Hey, good job.

43:30.816 --> 43:32.234
Damn it. There's more left.

43:36.989 --> 43:38.365
<i>Soo-young was right.</i>

43:39.450 --> 43:40.992
<i>The business was a hit,</i>

43:40.993 --> 43:43.370
<i>and the locals were excited
by its novelty.</i>

43:45.122 --> 43:46.373
Thank you.

43:48.167 --> 43:51.211
<i>Colombians started selling
duck down parkas too.</i>

43:52.671 --> 43:54.256
<i>But their quality was no match.</i>

43:55.549 --> 43:56.924
Well, it's nothing special.

43:56.925 --> 43:58.344
<i>Soo-young was smart.</i>

43:59.136 --> 44:02.013
<i>For reliable smuggling,
he needed connections in customs,</i>

44:02.014 --> 44:04.265
<i>so he gave Sergeant Park a large cut.</i>

44:04.266 --> 44:05.683
SIX PATHS CEO PARK JANG-SU

44:05.684 --> 44:08.771
<i>Sergeant Park had no reason
to decline the offer.</i>

44:11.190 --> 44:12.274
Mr. Park is here.

44:13.275 --> 44:15.276
<i>Awkward situations were unavoidable...</i>

44:15.277 --> 44:16.195
Hey, Kook-hee.

44:18.656 --> 44:20.741
<i>...but money made people forget.</i>

44:22.826 --> 44:25.536
<i>Just as they smuggled in goods,</i>

44:25.537 --> 44:27.373
<i>Koreans smuggled out money.</i>

44:29.833 --> 44:33.212
<i>Unreported money was continuously sent
to their homeland.</i>

44:35.881 --> 44:38.300
<i>The money was laundered through Hong Kong,</i>

44:39.301 --> 44:40.636
<i>then China,</i>

44:41.553 --> 44:43.138
<i>and finally Korea.</i>

44:48.394 --> 44:49.520
<i>Money equaled peace.</i>

44:58.696 --> 45:00.531
<i>I bought a new house in Zone 3...</i>

45:02.574 --> 45:04.033
<i>but this is just the beginning.</i>

45:04.034 --> 45:05.953
It's okay, Mom. This is our house.

45:06.704 --> 45:07.705
<i>Soo-young said</i>

45:09.123 --> 45:10.749
<i>we should go see the ocean.</i>

45:12.626 --> 45:15.212
CARTAGENA

45:21.385 --> 45:22.428
Let's go!

45:26.682 --> 45:28.016
Three, two, one!

45:39.194 --> 45:40.320
Hey, are you jealous?

45:41.071 --> 45:41.905
What?

45:42.406 --> 45:45.241
During the IMF crisis,
many kids went home broke,

45:45.242 --> 45:48.536
but these bastards are lucky
to have rich parents and are living it up.

45:48.537 --> 45:50.956
They say rich kids have a glow about them,

45:51.540 --> 45:53.000
but why do they look so dull?

45:56.336 --> 45:57.296
Give me your hand.

45:58.088 --> 45:59.798
- Huh?
- Your hand.

46:02.801 --> 46:05.053
- Did you see the first <i>James Bond</i> movie?
- No.

46:05.888 --> 46:08.432
This is the watch
Sean Connery has worn since then.

46:09.308 --> 46:10.726
A Rolex Submariner.

46:11.727 --> 46:12.561
Dope, right?

46:13.187 --> 46:14.188
What is this?

46:14.980 --> 46:16.814
Is it for me? It looks expensive.

46:16.815 --> 46:19.735
That's why I'm giving it to you.
Would I give you cheap crap?

46:21.028 --> 46:22.905
This is nice!

46:26.950 --> 46:27.784
Hey, Soo-young.

46:27.785 --> 46:29.870
I've been wondering for a while.

46:30.370 --> 46:32.414
Why didn't you go back to Korea?

46:34.041 --> 46:35.292
Why would I go back?

46:35.793 --> 46:37.795
If I did, I'd obviously end up a nobody.

46:39.129 --> 46:40.588
But man, look at this place.

46:40.589 --> 46:41.548
This place

46:42.508 --> 46:45.511
is fucking overflowing with life, yeah?

46:46.303 --> 46:47.846
This is the land of opportunity.

46:48.347 --> 46:49.515
What's your dream?

46:51.183 --> 46:52.391
Why would I have one?

46:52.392 --> 46:53.602
Well, my dream

46:54.895 --> 46:57.898
is to build a fucking amazing
shopping mall here in Colombia.

46:58.565 --> 47:00.359
One that South Americans go crazy for.

47:02.611 --> 47:04.613
What? You don't believe I can do it?

47:05.572 --> 47:09.283
Did you think I'd smuggle
duck down parkas forever, huh?

47:09.284 --> 47:11.078
No, I believe in you.

47:11.745 --> 47:12.871
Really, I do.

47:14.122 --> 47:17.542
Could you let me be
a part of that dream of yours?

47:17.543 --> 47:19.336
- Boss?
- You punk, get off me.

47:20.587 --> 47:22.422
- Of course. Sounds great.
- Great.

47:23.507 --> 47:25.968
A shopping mall sounds great.

47:26.593 --> 47:28.637
Hey, years ago, our chairman said this,

47:29.346 --> 47:32.808
"It's a big world,
and there's lots of shit to be done."

47:33.350 --> 47:37.603
A long time ago, someone told me
that's why Daewoo went under.

47:37.604 --> 47:40.148
And I'm so thankful they did.
Fucking Daewoo.

47:43.110 --> 47:46.113
Thanks for that!

47:47.406 --> 47:49.783
This isn't right.
They crossed the line this time!

47:50.284 --> 47:53.287
If we don't get our shit together,

47:53.871 --> 47:56.790
these rats will completely
take over the market!

47:57.291 --> 48:01.669
But they're kind and work hard,
and I don't think this is my problem.

48:01.670 --> 48:03.629
They're not like that at all.

48:03.630 --> 48:04.922
They're full of tricks,

48:04.923 --> 48:07.342
always ready to stab you
in the back at any moment.

48:08.093 --> 48:12.054
I think you're slandering
perfectly fine folks.

48:12.055 --> 48:14.516
Don't forget that you're a smuggler too.

48:15.183 --> 48:17.769
No, you're wrong, Carlos.

48:18.854 --> 48:20.772
We spend what we earn in this country.

48:21.273 --> 48:23.859
But they're sending their money
back to Korea.

48:24.902 --> 48:26.695
Let's think about it.

48:28.030 --> 48:30.115
Expect a bigger cut this Christmas.

48:34.786 --> 48:36.413
All right.

48:37.205 --> 48:38.415
You can afford to laugh.

48:53.430 --> 48:56.016
Perez! How have you been?
Working hard, my man.

48:56.683 --> 48:57.559
Drink these.

48:58.060 --> 48:59.311
Don't come any closer.

49:01.688 --> 49:02.522
What's going on?

49:06.777 --> 49:07.902
What's up with him?

49:07.903 --> 49:08.820
Perez!

49:09.863 --> 49:10.989
What's happening?

49:12.908 --> 49:13.950
Perez.

49:13.951 --> 49:15.409
Hey!

49:15.410 --> 49:16.828
Calm down. Take it easy!

49:17.412 --> 49:19.413
Lower your guns, and let's talk.

49:19.414 --> 49:20.706
- Arrest them.
- Aim.

49:20.707 --> 49:22.042
What's with you guys?

49:40.978 --> 49:43.271
Get inside! Hurry!

49:56.910 --> 49:58.577
Control stand 6-0-7.

49:58.578 --> 50:00.247
I repeat, control stand 6-0-7.

50:13.301 --> 50:15.511
What do you mean it was seized?

50:15.512 --> 50:17.221
Hey, please calm down.

50:17.222 --> 50:18.931
- Calm down?
- Those sons of bitches.

50:18.932 --> 50:21.642
Christmas is in less than ten days!

50:21.643 --> 50:23.394
- What do we sell?
- It's peak season.

50:23.395 --> 50:24.520
- Move!
- Please stop.

50:24.521 --> 50:27.149
If we miss the holidays, we're done!
You know that!

50:30.027 --> 50:32.069
- What are we gonna do?
- Come on.

50:32.070 --> 50:34.406
- Contact him now!
- Take responsibility!

50:38.201 --> 50:39.995
Why would Carlos suddenly do this?

50:41.788 --> 50:43.539
When we played poker last week,

50:43.540 --> 50:45.917
we let him win,
and everything seemed great.

50:48.712 --> 50:49.755
Hey, Jeon Soo-young.

50:51.214 --> 50:52.382
Do you know anything?

50:54.342 --> 50:55.802
What would I know?

50:56.386 --> 50:57.679
Are you suspicious of me?

50:58.263 --> 51:00.556
They seized two full containers
of my goods!

51:00.557 --> 51:02.016
That's worth 400 million won!

51:02.017 --> 51:04.602
All right.
I'm just frustrated. That's all.

51:04.603 --> 51:06.687
Isn't dealing with the higher-ups
your job?

51:06.688 --> 51:07.980
Why blame me? Damn it!

51:07.981 --> 51:10.192
I've had enough of you, punk.

51:10.859 --> 51:13.069
You think you're a big shot now, huh?

51:13.070 --> 51:15.029
You expanded too aggressively!

51:15.030 --> 51:18.450
My life's on the line every time!
What do you do in the back room?

51:20.410 --> 51:22.120
What the hell are you doing?

51:23.789 --> 51:24.915
Shut your traps.

51:25.874 --> 51:28.376
From now on,
only speak if you have a plan.

51:40.639 --> 51:41.807
Any ideas?

51:43.975 --> 51:44.810
C√∫cuta.

51:48.814 --> 51:49.898
What about C√∫cuta?

51:50.482 --> 51:54.861
Since Venezuela is overflowing
with smuggled goods,

51:56.363 --> 51:58.572
if we could just get to C√∫cuta...

51:58.573 --> 51:59.740
Hey, you're right.

51:59.741 --> 52:02.994
If we reach C√∫cuta,
we can get goods from Venezuela, right?

52:03.870 --> 52:05.454
They won't be Korean goods,

52:05.455 --> 52:07.915
but it should tide us over
until we fix this, right?

52:07.916 --> 52:09.292
Who's gonna go there?

52:09.793 --> 52:11.794
Who's gonna go into rebel territory?

52:11.795 --> 52:15.549
I heard the place is full of armed rebels.

52:24.641 --> 52:27.101
I don't know if this is the right call.

52:27.102 --> 52:28.728
You got another plan?

52:32.357 --> 52:33.525
Jesus.

52:34.317 --> 52:36.236
What a fucked-up situation.

52:38.989 --> 52:40.532
I put in 200 million won, bro.

52:41.908 --> 52:43.535
That's everything I've got.

52:45.704 --> 52:46.955
Without it, I'm dead.

52:49.457 --> 52:50.417
Yeah.

52:51.042 --> 52:52.085
It's all there.

52:56.882 --> 52:57.883
All right.

52:58.967 --> 53:00.719
Rebels aren't what they used to be.

53:01.303 --> 53:03.888
Then why don't you go with him, Mr. Park?

53:03.889 --> 53:04.806
Yeah.

53:05.974 --> 53:09.311
It is dangerous for him to go
on his own with all that cash.

53:39.257 --> 53:40.634
Mom! What's--

53:55.482 --> 53:58.151
For fuck's sake.
This is what you're resorting to now?

53:58.735 --> 53:59.736
Give me that.

54:02.739 --> 54:05.866
You can... always start over.

54:05.867 --> 54:07.160
So that thing...

54:07.661 --> 54:09.495
- Give it to me.
- Give you what?

54:09.496 --> 54:11.331
Just give it to me, Kook-hee!

54:11.998 --> 54:14.084
I know about it, too, so...

54:15.752 --> 54:17.128
Where is it?

54:21.925 --> 54:23.259
- Kook-hee.
- Put it down.

54:23.260 --> 54:25.136
Put it down. For fuck's sake!

54:25.762 --> 54:27.846
Let go! Put it down!

54:27.847 --> 54:29.014
- Kook-hee.
- Let go!

54:29.015 --> 54:32.101
- What are you doing?
- Kook-hee, give it to me, please!

54:32.102 --> 54:34.062
- Just give it to me!
- Put it down!

54:59.129 --> 55:00.963
Shit, why did you shoot?

55:00.964 --> 55:03.466
If we get caught, it's your fault!

55:08.763 --> 55:09.639
Out of my way!

55:18.189 --> 55:19.065
Damn it!

55:22.360 --> 55:23.403
Kook-hee.

56:19.542 --> 56:20.377
Father.

56:21.169 --> 56:22.170
My money.

56:25.715 --> 56:27.801
- My money.
- Father, you're bleeding.

56:28.426 --> 56:30.595
Fucking Colombia.

56:33.890 --> 56:35.516
- Colombia.
- Don't talk.

56:35.517 --> 56:37.185
I said don't talk! Fuck!

56:44.818 --> 56:45.901
Father.

56:45.902 --> 56:47.529
I'm tired.

56:48.071 --> 56:49.239
Kook-hee.

56:50.949 --> 56:51.783
Father.

57:06.965 --> 57:07.966
For fuck's sake.

57:14.180 --> 57:15.014
Father!

57:17.851 --> 57:18.852
<i>Father!</i>

57:34.409 --> 57:35.243
Hey, you...

57:35.827 --> 57:36.911
Come on, don't.

57:38.121 --> 57:38.955
Kook-hee.

57:44.836 --> 57:46.212
I know this isn't

57:47.380 --> 57:49.591
the best time to bring this up...

57:52.677 --> 57:54.179
but what about the money?

57:57.307 --> 57:58.725
I'll pay you back, sir.

58:07.942 --> 58:09.777
What are you going to do about this?

58:11.029 --> 58:14.949
We can't even open for business,
and now you've lost our remaining money.

58:15.700 --> 58:16.951
What are you going to do?

58:19.954 --> 58:21.080
I'll pay you back.

58:23.833 --> 58:25.960
How the fuck are you going to pay us back?

58:27.128 --> 58:30.215
What? Let go, damn it!
I just said what we're all thinking!

58:30.840 --> 58:31.925
I'll pay you back.

58:33.343 --> 58:34.968
I said I'd fucking pay you back!

58:34.969 --> 58:36.429
Let go!

58:37.514 --> 58:38.431
My money!

58:40.433 --> 58:41.267
Let go.

58:44.312 --> 58:45.980
It's everything we had!

58:47.315 --> 58:49.359
I'm sorry. I'll pay you back.

58:50.360 --> 58:52.946
I'll pay you back.

59:10.547 --> 59:11.548
Take this and go.

59:12.382 --> 59:13.383
Somewhere. Anywhere.

59:14.425 --> 59:15.426
Where would I go?

59:17.053 --> 59:18.845
My shop's here. I'm staying.

59:18.846 --> 59:20.389
You stupid idiot.

59:20.390 --> 59:22.641
Someone could shoot you at any moment.

59:22.642 --> 59:24.143
What are you gonna do about it?

59:26.020 --> 59:28.439
Those fucking customs bastards.

59:28.940 --> 59:31.317
Handing all our goods over to Alejandro...

59:32.777 --> 59:33.903
What did you say?

59:40.743 --> 59:41.619
Customs did what?

59:43.913 --> 59:45.665
What did customs do?

59:49.210 --> 59:50.628
Damn it.

59:51.671 --> 59:53.381
They handed over all our goods.

59:54.048 --> 59:57.593
<i>They seized our goods
and sent them to Alejandro's warehouse.</i>

59:57.594 --> 01:00:00.179
<i>Colombian merchants will get them
before Christmas.</i>

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.140
To shut down Korean businesses.

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:03.683
Get out of here.

01:00:05.184 --> 01:00:06.394
It's how you'll survive.

01:00:10.356 --> 01:00:11.399
Damn it.

01:00:21.534 --> 01:00:23.410
- No!
- This shit!

01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:25.037
No.

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:27.205
No, son of a bitch! Fuck!

01:00:27.206 --> 01:00:29.124
Don't forget my 50,000 pesos!

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:32.045
Calm down, you fat fuck.
It's just getting interesting.

01:00:51.856 --> 01:00:52.773
Who are you?

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:54.192
What's up?

01:00:56.402 --> 01:00:57.612
Are you deaf?

01:00:58.529 --> 01:01:00.531
I asked you a question!

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:04.577
I came to get the goods.

01:01:06.954 --> 01:01:08.289
"The goods"?

01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:11.959
Isn't it tomorrow?

01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:16.297
You know...

01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:21.468
You know how impatient the boss is.

01:01:21.469 --> 01:01:23.388
Then you should've called first.

01:01:23.971 --> 01:01:26.015
You take us for fools?

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:29.602
- Look, buddy.
- Forget it.

01:01:31.062 --> 01:01:33.564
Alejandro is being a bitch.

01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:40.738
Alejandro really is a fucking prick.

01:01:42.782 --> 01:01:44.242
- Thanks for the smokes.
- Yeah.

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:46.369
But I still need to check.

01:01:59.674 --> 01:02:02.427
He's so damn loud.

01:02:04.637 --> 01:02:05.512
No answer.

01:02:05.513 --> 01:02:08.015
I'm busy. Let's make it quick.

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:10.977
You're the first one here?

01:02:12.228 --> 01:02:13.896
What about the other trucks?

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:17.984
Fucker, you wouldn't come alone.

01:02:24.115 --> 01:02:25.366
Don't run!

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:35.751
No!

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:38.337
Please, no!

01:02:39.338 --> 01:02:40.965
Stop!

01:02:41.966 --> 01:02:43.593
No!

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:45.594
No!

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:49.932
Please, stop. Don't kill him!

01:02:56.731 --> 01:02:58.858
Let go! You son of a bitch!

01:02:59.358 --> 01:03:01.861
Let go!

01:03:34.977 --> 01:03:37.230
<i>Miguel came on Sergeant Park's orders.</i>

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:40.942
<i>We managed to get through
the holiday rush,</i>

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:42.902
<i>but this isn't over.</i>

01:03:44.111 --> 01:03:45.029
<i>People here</i>

01:03:46.572 --> 01:03:49.116
<i>don't pick up guns on Christmas.</i>

01:03:57.124 --> 01:03:58.876
Isn't it a bit too quiet, Soo-young?

01:03:59.877 --> 01:04:02.713
If we just read the room and stay back,
we'll be fine.

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:06.217
By the way,

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:08.719
how about Kook-hee?

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:11.681
Kook-hee?

01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:15.059
Are you feeling guilty now?

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:17.895
You're the one who told him.

01:04:18.479 --> 01:04:21.565
You said to wait for the right time
and tell him when--

01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:22.483
What the fuck?

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:24.360
Did I tell you to do that?

01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:27.488
You're making it sound like
I paid him to do it!

01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:28.822
Did I do that?

01:04:28.823 --> 01:04:31.409
Well. No, you didn't, but...

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:35.996
Is he a Korea University alum?

01:04:35.997 --> 01:04:37.999
Why do you even care about him?

01:04:45.339 --> 01:04:46.382
Close up early.

01:04:51.929 --> 01:04:53.306
Alejandro.

01:04:54.515 --> 01:04:56.308
What the fuck? You fucking bastard!

01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:58.227
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:05:00.187 --> 01:05:03.440
It wasn't me. It's a misunderstanding!

01:05:03.441 --> 01:05:05.318
No? It wasn't you?

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:09.404
Your boy robbed my warehouse,
but you didn't order him to?

01:05:09.405 --> 01:05:11.324
If I were gonna rob your warehouse,

01:05:11.824 --> 01:05:13.200
I wouldn't do it that way!

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:17.038
Don't you know who I am?

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:21.876
I'm Park Jang-su, you motherfucker!

01:05:22.877 --> 01:05:24.544
- Hey, Jae-ung.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

01:05:24.545 --> 01:05:26.255
I'm on the way.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:30.551
What is it this time?

01:05:31.218 --> 01:05:32.053
Are you worried?

01:05:32.678 --> 01:05:33.679
Will you be okay?

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:35.889
You should be, right?

01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:39.268
<i>With customs involved,
Alejandro can't do anything either.</i>

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:42.562
<i>Mr. Park said he'd handle it,
so don't worry.</i>

01:05:42.563 --> 01:05:46.149
Damn, Kook-hee. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said all that.

01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:47.068
Jae-ung.

01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:51.781
You and Soo-young are the only ones
who came to my father's funeral.

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:54.951
You know I like you, right?

01:05:58.496 --> 01:05:59.330
Yeah.

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:18.641
It's been a long day.

01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:32.905
Very well.

01:06:33.948 --> 01:06:37.994
Let's clear up... this misunderstanding.

01:07:34.216 --> 01:07:38.428
Don't think too hard.
Just hand the boy over.

01:07:38.429 --> 01:07:41.891
That'd reaffirm our friendship.

01:07:44.101 --> 01:07:46.353
We can bury the hatchet.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:47.897
My friend.

01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:54.111
Colombians forget the past quickly.

01:07:55.446 --> 01:07:58.991
Living day to day is hard enough here.

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:01.243
Very hard.

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:04.747
Cheers.

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:17.760
You're here.

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:26.477
Don Alejandro chose not to cause
any trouble over this incident.

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:29.980
It's all okay now.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:37.279
But man, this ugly bastard
is asking us for half our profit.

01:08:45.329 --> 01:08:46.539
Did you know?

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:49.291
What?

01:08:50.501 --> 01:08:52.545
- What do you mean?
- Wait a minute.

01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:56.674
Kiddo, have you forgotten where you are?

01:08:57.591 --> 01:08:59.009
This is Colombia.

01:08:59.552 --> 01:09:03.180
We speak Spanish here.

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:10.771
Listen carefully.

01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:17.570
I've got no money or goods
for thieves like you.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:20.029
That <i>sicario</i> you hired,

01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:21.866
I paid him double.

01:09:23.075 --> 01:09:24.660
You fucking bastard!

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:34.753
What did you just do?

01:09:45.139 --> 01:09:45.973
No.

01:09:48.726 --> 01:09:50.728
I don't know what you're thinking,

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:53.480
but it's utter nonsense.

01:09:58.485 --> 01:09:59.486
Kook-hee.

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:05.993
What is it?

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:08.204
Tell me.

01:10:15.419 --> 01:10:17.504
I need to survive and reach Zone 6.

01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:20.549
Uncle.

01:10:48.035 --> 01:10:50.412
The path to enlightenment
is through compassion.

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:55.084
The path to enlightenment
is through compassion.

01:10:56.293 --> 01:10:58.671
<i>The path to enlightenment
is through compassion!</i>

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:20.066
Carlos, congratulations on your promotion.

01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:23.195
And please accept our condolences.

01:11:23.904 --> 01:11:26.240
Alejandro was an old friend of yours.

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:30.661
When the killer is caught,
we'll know who was behind it.

01:11:31.578 --> 01:11:33.330
What do you mean?

01:11:34.331 --> 01:11:36.749
Many people are curious
about where Alejandro got

01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:39.461
all those Korean products
in his warehouse.

01:11:44.258 --> 01:11:50.179
Please allow Koreans
to contribute to revitalizing

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:53.058
the Colombian economy.

01:11:53.767 --> 01:11:55.644
Listen, I have one thing to tell you.

01:11:56.437 --> 01:11:58.229
I do not like cakes.

01:11:58.230 --> 01:11:59.982
You'll learn to like them.

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:02.901
This is how Koreans show appreciation.

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:13.495
Is this Kook-hee's message?

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:16.415
<i>It's the wish of all the merchants.</i>

01:12:42.107 --> 01:12:43.525
<i>We found her, Kook-hee.</i>

01:12:44.318 --> 01:12:45.736
<i>The bitch who killed your father.</i>

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:57.081
See you again, my friend.

01:13:02.294 --> 01:13:04.338
<i>Sergeant Park kept his mouth shut,</i>

01:13:06.006 --> 01:13:07.091
<i>and people</i>

01:13:08.425 --> 01:13:09.551
<i>now fear me.</i>

01:13:35.452 --> 01:13:37.036
3 YEARS LATER

01:13:37.037 --> 01:13:40.332
<i>In exchange
for exempting customs duties in Bogot√°,</i>

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:45.628
<i>there has been an endless stream
of corruption involving bribes.</i>

01:13:45.629 --> 01:13:49.425
<i>Countless smuggled goods
are taking over the San Andresito Market,</i>

01:13:50.175 --> 01:13:54.346
<i>and despite opposition from the smugglers,</i>

01:13:55.013 --> 01:13:58.349
<i>raids will never stop.</i>

01:13:58.350 --> 01:14:02.563
<i>Congress has introduced
the Anti-Smuggling Act,</i>

01:14:03.063 --> 01:14:06.066
<i>and we'll properly root out
the illegal activities happening</i>

01:14:06.567 --> 01:14:08.318
<i>in the San Andresito Market.</i>

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:24.292
<i>Anti-Smuggling Act?</i>

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:26.544
Tell them to fuck off with that shit!

01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:29.631
Does this country even have any goods
that haven't been smuggled in?

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:31.508
Don't get worked up.

01:14:32.926 --> 01:14:34.011
What about customs?

01:14:34.511 --> 01:14:37.806
There are rumors running rampant
that they're gonna raid the market.

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:41.351
Kook-hee!

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.231
Did you have a good trip?

01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:49.233
Wow, you went to Seoul
and brought back good vibes!

01:14:49.234 --> 01:14:51.068
It's just a phase!

01:14:51.069 --> 01:14:52.945
Reform, my ass.

01:14:52.946 --> 01:14:54.781
It's not that simple a problem.

01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:59.453
Chinese goods are cheaper now,
and our costs have increased.

01:15:00.579 --> 01:15:01.914
We need to change too.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:03.874
Hey, wait.

01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:07.753
Are you saying we need to accept
the Anti-Smuggling Act?

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:09.420
Is that it?

01:15:09.421 --> 01:15:10.964
This is Bogot√°.

01:15:12.299 --> 01:15:13.425
It's Colombia.

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:18.012
How long do you think this will go on?

01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:21.058
We just need to lay low for a while,
like we always do.

01:15:21.975 --> 01:15:24.143
Is the Anti-Smuggling Act about smuggling?

01:15:24.144 --> 01:15:25.145
Those guys?

01:15:26.813 --> 01:15:29.815
This is them trying to push Koreans
out of San Andresito.

01:15:29.816 --> 01:15:31.401
Why act like you don't know?

01:15:31.985 --> 01:15:32.819
Hey, Jae-ung.

01:15:33.737 --> 01:15:35.738
I saw Carlos the other day
with a new woman.

01:15:35.739 --> 01:15:38.867
Lots of expenses this time.
You know what I mean?

01:15:39.451 --> 01:15:40.410
Be prepared.

01:15:42.579 --> 01:15:44.957
Bro, that's enough.

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:48.293
I'm the one making the decision.

01:16:02.015 --> 01:16:03.308
That fucking bastard!

01:16:10.315 --> 01:16:13.068
HONORARY DIPLOMA

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:17.906
PRESIDENTIAL COMMENDATION
SONG KOOK-HEE

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:31.627
Hey!

01:16:31.628 --> 01:16:32.754
Don't touch them!

01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:36.549
Get out of my way!
Out of my way, you bastards.

01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:37.758
Let go of that!

01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:40.553
- No.
- Don't touch!

01:16:40.554 --> 01:16:41.722
Leave those alone!

01:16:42.389 --> 01:16:44.348
- I said out of my way!
- Wait a minute!

01:16:44.349 --> 01:16:45.434
Don't touch them!

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.314
Let's just talk about it.

01:16:51.148 --> 01:16:51.982
Hold on!

01:17:07.831 --> 01:17:10.958
<i>The protest, which openly opposes
the Anti-Smuggling Act,</i>

01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:13.252
<i>is becoming increasingly violent.</i>

01:17:13.253 --> 01:17:17.465
<i>The Santa Fe shopping district,
which is resisting the most fiercely,</i>

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:22.012
<i>is led by Korean migrants
and is now in a standoff with the police.</i>

01:17:41.865 --> 01:17:43.867
Why the fuck are you doing this?

01:17:44.368 --> 01:17:46.078
You said you'd wait.

01:17:47.621 --> 01:17:49.539
Help me!

01:17:50.582 --> 01:17:51.833
Look at them!

01:17:53.251 --> 01:17:55.128
Can't you see they're out of control?

01:17:56.129 --> 01:17:58.089
What the fuck do you expect me to do?

01:17:58.090 --> 01:17:59.131
Sir.

01:17:59.132 --> 01:18:00.049
Oh, come on.

01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:02.803
Please trust me! I'll take care of it!

01:18:06.264 --> 01:18:07.099
Sanches.

01:18:08.642 --> 01:18:10.560
Let the guy heading your way in.

01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:13.438
<i>He said he'll take care of this.</i>

01:18:13.939 --> 01:18:15.232
<i>We have nothing to lose.</i>

01:18:19.152 --> 01:18:19.985
WE WANT TO SURVIVE

01:18:19.986 --> 01:18:21.779
Guarantee our survival!

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.990
Police and customs, get out!

01:18:24.741 --> 01:18:26.284
We're all going to die. Fuck!

01:18:27.244 --> 01:18:28.661
I'll persuade them, okay?

01:18:28.662 --> 01:18:31.038
Persuade who? Whose side are you on?

01:18:31.039 --> 01:18:32.540
This isn't the time to pick sides!

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:35.793
Mr. Song, I heard you support the Act!

01:18:35.794 --> 01:18:37.586
Did anyone here say we support it?

01:18:37.587 --> 01:18:39.338
None of us fucking did!

01:18:39.339 --> 01:18:42.467
Guarantee our survival!

01:18:43.343 --> 01:18:45.971
Move faster. Put it down.

01:18:53.437 --> 01:18:54.271
Stay away!

01:18:55.439 --> 01:18:56.273
Let go of me!

01:19:12.122 --> 01:19:15.542
Shit, my eyes are burning!
You motherfuckers!

01:19:16.334 --> 01:19:18.086
Hey, you sons of bitches!

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:21.506
- What the hell?
- Fuck you!

01:19:23.133 --> 01:19:24.092
Leave it!

01:19:49.075 --> 01:19:50.409
Get everyone out!

01:19:50.410 --> 01:19:52.245
Do whatever it takes!

01:19:52.829 --> 01:19:53.663
Look.

01:19:54.539 --> 01:19:56.166
Give them what they want.

01:19:56.666 --> 01:19:57.751
Whatever it is!

01:19:58.877 --> 01:20:00.253
Fucking useless piece of shit.

01:20:06.092 --> 01:20:09.221
Damn it. Seriously.

01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:15.143
I've already got one foot in the grave.

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:20.524
But a cake box won't be
anywhere near enough for this incident.

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:24.152
I guess we need to give him
an apple crate, at least.

01:20:24.653 --> 01:20:26.321
What do you think?

01:20:32.577 --> 01:20:35.372
A diabetic shouldn't smoke.
I just do it out of habit.

01:20:44.714 --> 01:20:45.549
So?

01:20:47.133 --> 01:20:48.510
What did you tell them, Uncle?

01:20:49.135 --> 01:20:50.595
Goodness, what would I say?

01:20:51.596 --> 01:20:54.724
I'm president of the Korean Association,
but I'm powerless.

01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:58.061
People from my hometown, you know,

01:20:58.979 --> 01:20:59.938
are always neutral.

01:21:06.945 --> 01:21:08.113
But speaking of which...

01:21:10.949 --> 01:21:15.161
monks don't leave a temple
because they dislike the temple itself.

01:21:17.163 --> 01:21:18.665
It's the head monk they dislike.

01:21:21.251 --> 01:21:23.211
Don't cross the line, too, Uncle.

01:21:25.839 --> 01:21:27.090
And set up a meeting.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:29.634
All right.

01:21:48.278 --> 01:21:50.822
A shopping mall sounds great.

01:21:54.034 --> 01:21:54.993
Terranova.

01:21:56.453 --> 01:21:58.079
What a damn grandiose name.

01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:01.666
How long has it been?

01:22:04.210 --> 01:22:05.337
Not long.

01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:08.173
The market's going to change anyway.

01:22:10.425 --> 01:22:12.844
Meaning only the legal shops will survive.

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:16.890
So you're the legal merchant,
and I'm just the dirty, illegal smuggler?

01:22:19.392 --> 01:22:20.852
I didn't say that, bro.

01:22:25.315 --> 01:22:26.191
All right.

01:22:29.069 --> 01:22:30.737
Sergeant Park's out anyway.

01:22:31.279 --> 01:22:32.447
Now you're the top dog.

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:36.116
Any losses or damages incurred
will hit you the hardest.

01:22:36.117 --> 01:22:37.243
I get it.

01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:40.204
Then you should leave too.

01:22:40.205 --> 01:22:42.082
Walk away from the market.

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:45.752
Stop calling me "dog."

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:48.797
Hey, dog.

01:22:51.007 --> 01:22:53.425
If the monk dislikes the temple,
he should leave.

01:22:53.426 --> 01:22:55.844
Why try to renovate the whole damn temple?

01:22:55.845 --> 01:22:57.305
For fuck's sake!

01:22:58.473 --> 01:23:00.849
You wanted a mall
South Americans would go crazy for.

01:23:00.850 --> 01:23:02.185
Don't you remember?

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:09.734
Bro, I'm sorry.

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:12.696
Let's not do this.

01:23:13.363 --> 01:23:14.656
That was our dream.

01:23:15.365 --> 01:23:16.408
"Our" dream?

01:23:20.286 --> 01:23:21.413
So you should try--

01:23:22.372 --> 01:23:23.248
"Our" dream?

01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:27.627
Is it ours?

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:29.295
Huh? Ours?

01:23:35.176 --> 01:23:36.177
Don't do this.

01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:39.639
It was my fucking dream.
How did it become ours?

01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:57.032
<i>What are you trying to say?</i>

01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:00.410
We'll shut down the smuggling routes.

01:24:00.994 --> 01:24:02.828
And the new shopping mall

01:24:02.829 --> 01:24:05.080
will only carry legal products.

01:24:05.081 --> 01:24:07.584
Legal? Bullshit.

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:10.127
I was a fool for coming here.

01:24:10.128 --> 01:24:11.628
Get up, everyone! Let's go!

01:24:11.629 --> 01:24:14.548
Either way, we're foreigners
in this country, right?

01:24:14.549 --> 01:24:16.633
We're the ones to suffer, not them.

01:24:16.634 --> 01:24:19.220
Hey, you think
we've had an easy life here?

01:24:20.388 --> 01:24:22.223
The way I fucking see it,

01:24:22.974 --> 01:24:25.852
you have no idea
how we do things around here.

01:24:27.687 --> 01:24:28.855
How you do things here?

01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:31.608
If you do things my way,

01:24:32.692 --> 01:24:36.195
I'll take full responsibility
for any losses from seized goods.

01:24:36.196 --> 01:24:37.405
I'll cover them in full.

01:24:41.951 --> 01:24:43.702
Seized goods aren't the only problem!

01:24:43.703 --> 01:24:46.164
Things will stay like this
from now on, won't they?

01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:48.166
If we incur more losses,

01:24:49.834 --> 01:24:51.544
will you cover those too?

01:24:52.462 --> 01:24:53.338
Will you?

01:24:54.672 --> 01:24:56.633
Why can't you fucking answer the question?

01:24:57.967 --> 01:24:58.802
We're forming...

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:04.140
a new Korean Businessman Association.

01:25:04.974 --> 01:25:06.350
Will that be enough?

01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:07.976
The new shopping mall.

01:25:07.977 --> 01:25:10.062
Someone has to manage it.

01:25:10.063 --> 01:25:12.398
Give us management rights,

01:25:12.899 --> 01:25:14.900
and we'll reconsider it.

01:25:14.901 --> 01:25:16.069
Mr. Park.

01:26:02.365 --> 01:26:03.740
Tell him to quit the bullshit.

01:26:03.741 --> 01:26:06.452
We've been through it all here
in the past 20 years.

01:26:06.953 --> 01:26:07.954
Haven't we?

01:26:08.997 --> 01:26:10.623
We can't go down like this,

01:26:11.541 --> 01:26:12.417
can we?

01:26:33.313 --> 01:26:34.939
<i>It'll come in handy someday.</i>

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:38.359
<i>This is Colombia, after all.</i>

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:40.945
SON OF A BITCH

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:26.950
Put it on that rack.

01:27:28.117 --> 01:27:29.159
This needs to go.

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:31.788
Hello? I'll be right there.

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:33.915
I'm coming.

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:35.999
Kook-hee!

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.252
Let's go.

01:28:11.869 --> 01:28:13.621
Fucking Colombia.

01:29:02.378 --> 01:29:03.504
It was you, wasn't it?

01:29:04.005 --> 01:29:05.757
Yes, it fucking was. Happy now?

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:08.300
Hurry and tell Kook-hee it wasn't me.

01:29:08.301 --> 01:29:09.885
You think you'll be safe?

01:29:09.886 --> 01:29:12.262
Tell him it was you, for fuck's sake!

01:29:12.263 --> 01:29:14.306
Tell him yourself, asshole!

01:29:14.307 --> 01:29:16.016
You and Kook-hee are tight.

01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:18.519
You've been kissing his ass
for so long, dipshit.

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:21.147
Why? Are you worried he won't believe you?

01:29:21.647 --> 01:29:23.065
You fucking coward.

01:29:23.066 --> 01:29:24.983
Eat shit and die, motherfucker!

01:29:24.984 --> 01:29:26.402
Fucking dumbass!

01:29:57.767 --> 01:29:59.769
Have your injuries healed now?

01:30:00.603 --> 01:30:02.814
This is a security level two vehicle.

01:30:03.314 --> 01:30:04.648
It has 22 armor plates

01:30:04.649 --> 01:30:07.568
and windows made of polycarbonate,
not glass.

01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:11.906
Yes, it's nice.

01:30:12.448 --> 01:30:14.117
Yeah, it's nice and sturdy.

01:30:15.451 --> 01:30:16.661
I have to say...

01:30:19.038 --> 01:30:20.623
I'm very grateful to you.

01:30:24.752 --> 01:30:25.585
Well, yeah.

01:30:25.586 --> 01:30:28.798
I'll help you as much as I can.

01:30:39.642 --> 01:30:40.642
I won't be long.

01:30:40.643 --> 01:30:42.520
No, it's fine. Take your time.

01:30:49.318 --> 01:30:51.737
ACUPUNCTURE CLINIC

01:31:04.876 --> 01:31:05.710
Hey.

01:31:06.961 --> 01:31:07.795
It's me.

01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:09.672
Yes!

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:11.549
Don't you understand?

01:31:12.675 --> 01:31:15.010
Cancel my flight in two days!

01:31:15.011 --> 01:31:17.472
And get me on the next flight!

01:31:17.972 --> 01:31:20.223
Yes, anywhere!

01:31:20.224 --> 01:31:21.392
Fastest one!

01:31:23.936 --> 01:31:25.146
Yes, that's good.

01:31:27.023 --> 01:31:27.857
Here you go.

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:30.650
If you're traveling a long way,

01:31:30.651 --> 01:31:32.695
emeralds transport better.

01:31:34.864 --> 01:31:35.865
By the way,

01:31:36.449 --> 01:31:37.782
where are you going?

01:31:37.783 --> 01:31:40.203
I don't fucking know. What does it matter?

01:31:41.412 --> 01:31:44.415
Just a place to lay low
until things die down a little.

01:31:44.999 --> 01:31:47.210
I don't think
things will die down that easily.

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:50.796
Hold on. Let me get you a few more.

01:32:29.335 --> 01:32:30.461
It wasn't me.

01:32:31.462 --> 01:32:32.964
<i>I didn't do it.</i>

01:32:34.966 --> 01:32:35.841
I know.

01:32:36.676 --> 01:32:37.717
What?

01:32:37.718 --> 01:32:40.221
<i>I know you didn't do it, bro.</i>

01:32:47.645 --> 01:32:48.646
I did it.

01:32:53.317 --> 01:32:54.443
What are you saying?

01:32:54.944 --> 01:32:58.281
<i>If something's infected and full of pus,
it needs to be popped.</i>

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.325
Everyone thinks someone tried to kill me,

01:33:02.785 --> 01:33:04.203
but they failed.

01:33:05.204 --> 01:33:06.038
So...

01:33:10.209 --> 01:33:12.003
no one else will dare try.

01:33:13.671 --> 01:33:15.213
Cut the bullshit, asshole.

01:33:15.214 --> 01:33:16.424
<i>Let's drop this, bro.</i>

01:33:17.174 --> 01:33:18.676
No one got hurt.

01:33:21.137 --> 01:33:23.097
Now you just need to return to your place.

01:33:26.434 --> 01:33:29.562
You son of a bitch,
acting high and mighty to the end, huh?

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:31.856
I won't repeat myself.

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.274
They failed, so no one else will try?

01:33:34.275 --> 01:33:36.985
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

01:33:36.986 --> 01:33:38.403
<i>You think I'll stop there?</i>

01:33:38.404 --> 01:33:39.614
<i>I'm also going to kill</i>

01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:41.365
your mother and--

01:33:43.993 --> 01:33:47.163
Don't move.
I'm inserting an acupuncture needle.

01:34:13.648 --> 01:34:17.485
I hope something like this
never happens between us again.

01:34:18.653 --> 01:34:21.196
Why come all the way
to the other side of the world

01:34:21.197 --> 01:34:23.699
just to act like this
with our fellow countrymen?

01:34:58.109 --> 01:34:59.068
Do you remember?

01:35:02.279 --> 01:35:04.115
You told me to survive and reach Zone 6.

01:35:05.533 --> 01:35:06.534
I do remember.

01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:11.080
But honestly,

01:35:11.706 --> 01:35:13.791
I never expected you to actually make it.

01:35:17.712 --> 01:35:18.713
Impressive.

01:35:47.908 --> 01:35:49.910
God. Okay. That's enough.

01:35:52.788 --> 01:35:53.914
That's it for me.

01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:56.834
Oh my.

01:37:01.524 --> 01:37:05.653
<i>La cucaracha, la cucaracha</i>

01:37:10.449 --> 01:37:15.329
<i>La cucaracha, la cucaracha</i>

01:37:16.372 --> 01:37:18.791
<i>It can no longer walk</i>

01:37:20.167 --> 01:37:22.169
<i>Because it doesn't have</i>

01:37:23.587 --> 01:37:25.548
<i>Because it's lacking</i>

01:37:26.549 --> 01:37:29.260
<i>Marijuana to smoke</i>

01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:32.054
<i>La cucaracha</i>

01:37:32.721 --> 01:37:34.473
<i>La cucaracha</i>

01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:36.475
<i>It can no longer...</i>

01:37:41.188 --> 01:37:42.022
Uncle.

01:37:44.650 --> 01:37:48.320
Why did the locals here
call you a cockroach?

01:37:52.366 --> 01:37:55.411
Those bastards hadn't seen many Asians.

01:37:56.328 --> 01:37:57.788
Plus, I'm kind of small.

01:37:58.873 --> 01:38:00.415
I guess they took me for a chump.

01:38:00.416 --> 01:38:02.250
Those bastards, they don't have shit.

01:38:02.251 --> 01:38:04.295
Do you know which creature on Earth

01:38:05.004 --> 01:38:07.339
will survive until the end?

01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:09.174
Which one?

01:38:11.218 --> 01:38:12.219
The cockroach.

01:38:14.471 --> 01:38:15.889
La cucaracha.

01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:16.932
Wow.

01:38:18.058 --> 01:38:19.476
That's quite meaningful.

01:38:22.062 --> 01:38:23.022
Life...

01:38:25.691 --> 01:38:26.817
is so overwhelming.

01:38:32.239 --> 01:38:34.992
Mr. Song, let's pull over.
I need to take a leak.

01:39:16.408 --> 01:39:17.576
That's bulletproof!

01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:20.536
Bulletproof!

01:39:20.537 --> 01:39:22.372
It won't break!

01:39:22.373 --> 01:39:23.999
You dumbass!

01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:26.459
Why won't you understand, you little shit?

01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:27.710
It won't shatter!

01:39:27.711 --> 01:39:28.921
Do you understand?

01:39:37.054 --> 01:39:38.639
Hello?

01:39:39.223 --> 01:39:40.432
Can you hear me?

01:39:41.558 --> 01:39:43.601
This car has great soundproofing too.

01:39:43.602 --> 01:39:44.687
Dear me.

01:39:45.479 --> 01:39:47.564
It's strange, isn't it?

01:39:49.108 --> 01:39:52.319
I sent my wife and daughter to Seoul,
even though they wanted to stay.

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:56.198
It's been over three years
since I said I'd wrap up and join them.

01:39:57.449 --> 01:40:00.911
I really don't know
what's keeping me here.

01:40:02.204 --> 01:40:04.748
Anyway, my dear nephew sure is different.

01:40:05.749 --> 01:40:06.583
Right?

01:40:08.419 --> 01:40:12.631
Different from your father
and different from the other Koreans here.

01:40:15.843 --> 01:40:16.719
But you know...

01:40:18.721 --> 01:40:20.431
you're just too different.

01:40:21.682 --> 01:40:23.434
Being different brings trouble.

01:40:32.901 --> 01:40:35.571
Say hello. This is Alejandro's eldest son.

01:41:11.565 --> 01:41:12.566
Impressive.

01:42:29.518 --> 01:42:35.606
BOGOT√Å
