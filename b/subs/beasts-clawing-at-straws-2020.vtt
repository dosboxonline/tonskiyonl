"Cleaning in Progress"

01:53.334 --> 01:56.000
Human body parts

01:56.001 --> 01:58.543
were discovered by lake.

01:58.751 --> 02:02.542
Also last night,
a garbage truck ran over a man,

02:02.543 --> 02:06.375
who ran out of an alley
without looking at the signs.

02:06.376 --> 02:10.917
The police arrested a man
in his 40s last night,

02:10.918 --> 02:14.001
who amassed and stole $1
million investment money.

02:28.751 --> 02:29.851
Holy cow!

02:31.876 --> 02:33.126
What the...

03:01.959 --> 03:03.418
Dammit!

03:09.751 --> 03:10.851
Hey.

03:13.001 --> 03:15.459
Someone forgot this.

03:15.668 --> 03:17.917
He came before dawn,

03:17.918 --> 03:19.751
but left and hasn't come back.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.000
I'll put it in the storage.

03:22.001 --> 03:23.101
Okay.

05:03.126 --> 05:06.168
I told you to put on the diaper.

05:07.251 --> 05:09.875
I'm not 3 years old, why should I?

05:09.876 --> 05:11.543
Or use the toilet.

05:12.918 --> 05:15.459
How could she clean after you every time?

05:16.376 --> 05:18.168
Think about her for once.

05:18.626 --> 05:21.542
She doesn't work at the shop at all,

05:21.543 --> 05:23.959
she just fools around at home.

05:24.209 --> 05:26.168
Don't say things like that.

05:26.793 --> 05:29.293
Your father worked hard for that shop.

05:30.793 --> 05:35.334
If you work so lazily,
all the regulars will leave.

05:51.709 --> 05:54.126
She was going to the shop earlier,

05:54.334 --> 05:57.043
I barely stopped her by the beach stairs,

05:58.001 --> 06:01.668
she kept yelling at me,
saying I'm killing her.

06:02.334 --> 06:04.668
She'll mention it, just so you know.

06:08.793 --> 06:09.893
I got it.

06:12.126 --> 06:14.126
And Yoon-hee called.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.626
She couldn't get student loan,

06:19.168 --> 06:21.168
she'll take a semester off to work.

06:26.459 --> 06:29.751

06:47.334 --> 06:48.751
Ah Shit

07:03.001 --> 07:04.101
Next.

07:11.168 --> 07:12.543
Look at the camera.

07:12.959 --> 07:14.251
Finger.

07:20.876 --> 07:21.976
Bye.

07:27.501 --> 07:30.001
"PARK: Come to my shop after work."

07:30.126 --> 07:31.751
Dammit...

07:34.876 --> 07:36.168
Look!

07:57.709 --> 07:58.834
Go inside.

08:01.876 --> 08:04.418
Dumbass, he met a wrong woman.

08:13.918 --> 08:16.209
Mr. Port officer!

08:17.501 --> 08:18.601
Mr. PARK!

08:20.543 --> 08:22.418
My handsome officer!

08:23.543 --> 08:24.959
This way.

08:26.001 --> 08:28.125
They should've cleaned it up.

08:28.126 --> 08:29.375
Over here.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.834
Shit...

08:31.251 --> 08:32.751
Did you have dinner?

08:33.251 --> 08:34.459
I'm fine.

08:35.001 --> 08:37.168
Let's see!

08:37.876 --> 08:39.209
Now.

08:40.709 --> 08:43.584
Let's have a moment of truth.

08:47.334 --> 08:48.626
Could I...

08:49.876 --> 08:51.834
get a little more time?

08:55.126 --> 08:56.876
What are you doing?

08:57.126 --> 09:01.251
I remember you promising
to pay me back today.

09:02.001 --> 09:03.501
You said so yourself,

09:03.834 --> 09:08.583
I can have your wrist
if you break the promise.

09:08.584 --> 09:09.793
My wrist?

09:12.626 --> 09:14.793
We didn't talk about that.

09:15.293 --> 09:17.584
Goddammit...

09:18.709 --> 09:21.334
If it wasn't for Yeon-hee,
I wouldn't be here.

09:21.376 --> 09:22.917
You know I'm a victim too.

09:22.918 --> 09:24.876
So what then?

09:25.251 --> 09:27.708
You co-signed her loan,

09:27.709 --> 09:31.958
if you feel so wronged,
then bring her here.

09:31.959 --> 09:34.501
If I can, I'd do that right away!

09:34.668 --> 09:37.375
But she disappeared without a trace,

09:37.376 --> 09:40.251
and left all her stuff at my place.

09:40.793 --> 09:41.893
Mr. PARK,

09:42.501 --> 09:44.626
please give me one more week.

09:45.334 --> 09:47.292
I got a lead for that money.

09:47.293 --> 09:48.542
When? How?

09:48.543 --> 09:49.918
Come on...

09:54.709 --> 09:56.584
It's a trade secret.

09:58.376 --> 09:59.918
Just one week.

10:01.043 --> 10:04.751
I'll pay everything back with interest!

10:06.584 --> 10:11.876
If you miss it again, he'll swing by.

10:12.209 --> 10:15.376
He likes eating intestines.

10:19.084 --> 10:20.750
Fish, animal, or people,

10:20.751 --> 10:24.501
he's gotta have them raw.

10:29.376 --> 10:30.834
Dammit.

11:10.543 --> 11:13.209
"Yeon-hee"

11:19.043 --> 11:21.000

leave a message...

11:36.918 --> 11:38.168
Mi-ran.

11:39.501 --> 11:41.626
Did you ask the boss for an advance?

11:41.751 --> 11:43.709
Yes, thank you.

11:44.376 --> 11:46.459
She cares so much for you.

11:47.876 --> 11:49.709
- Feeling good?
- Yes.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.125
A prick in #302 keeps shooing girls away,

11:52.126 --> 11:54.126
could you go make him happy?

11:56.501 --> 11:58.334
Sir, we got a girl for you.

12:07.543 --> 12:08.793
Okay.

12:09.376 --> 12:11.043
Wait...

12:11.334 --> 12:12.709
I'll take her.

12:13.168 --> 12:15.918
Took you long enough.

12:16.876 --> 12:18.376
Have a great time!

12:18.751 --> 12:19.959
Hello there.

12:23.918 --> 12:25.501
Are you from China?

12:26.459 --> 12:27.559
Yes.

12:28.876 --> 12:30.168
Where exactly?

12:31.001 --> 12:32.918
You know Huanren?

12:35.293 --> 12:37.043
What brings you here?

12:38.834 --> 12:40.001
I fled.

12:42.376 --> 12:43.751
What did you do?

12:46.584 --> 12:48.293
I killed a man.

12:56.876 --> 12:57.918
I'm kidding.

12:57.919 --> 13:00.376
Came to make money, what else?

13:30.751 --> 13:31.851
Hey.

13:35.126 --> 13:36.334
Wake up.

13:38.376 --> 13:42.751
You're home?

13:45.251 --> 13:48.958
You got a nice life.

13:48.959 --> 13:51.001
Sorry, I'll clean up.

13:53.376 --> 13:54.476
Hey.

13:56.418 --> 13:58.001
Holy shit...

13:58.459 --> 14:02.584
Do you still not get
the situation we're in?

14:03.501 --> 14:06.292
I'm working my ass off

14:06.293 --> 14:08.333
to clean up your mess.

14:08.334 --> 14:10.708
I'm working to pay it off too.

14:10.709 --> 14:11.809
What?

14:13.709 --> 14:14.668
Wait a minute.

14:14.669 --> 14:16.084
Did I hear that right?

14:16.876 --> 14:18.000
What did you say?

14:18.001 --> 14:18.834
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

14:18.835 --> 14:20.334
No, before that.

14:21.293 --> 14:24.208
Bitch, do you not know

14:24.209 --> 14:25.751
how much you got scammed?

14:26.751 --> 14:31.793
What am I supposed to do with you?!

14:32.668 --> 14:35.084
I'm sorry, it's all my fault.

14:38.543 --> 14:40.584
This won't do, you need a beating.

14:40.751 --> 14:44.293
I'm sorry! Honey I'm sorry!

14:46.293 --> 14:50.126
"Jin-tae: You free tomorrow?"

15:01.709 --> 15:04.751

wanna grab some beer?"

"Chapter 2: Bait"

15:31.918 --> 15:33.018
Dong-pal?

15:35.168 --> 15:36.959
Sure, don't worry.

15:38.543 --> 15:40.626
Did you get the money in cash?

15:44.334 --> 15:47.875
Too many cameras at train station,

15:47.876 --> 15:49.000
so take the bus.

15:49.001 --> 15:51.334
The last ship departs at 10,

15:51.543 --> 15:53.209
so be here by 8.

15:55.334 --> 15:57.042
I'll wait in my car,

15:57.043 --> 15:58.584
so you'll see me.

16:00.959 --> 16:03.834
It's fine, we're friends.

16:04.459 --> 16:07.793
Never use your credit card.

16:10.168 --> 16:13.251
Yeah, be careful, see you in 2 days.

"Delete Call Record"

16:18.126 --> 16:19.226
"Delete"

16:26.209 --> 16:28.833
Yo, Carp.

16:28.834 --> 16:31.833
Yo, Tae-young.

16:31.834 --> 16:33.250
Come, come...

16:33.251 --> 16:35.751
What's he trying to pull now?

16:36.793 --> 16:38.793
- Hey, Carp!
- Hi!

16:40.751 --> 16:43.793
I'm really busy, what is it now?

16:43.876 --> 16:45.209
Punk ass!

16:45.626 --> 16:48.208
Business must be booming,
pretending to be busy.

16:48.209 --> 16:51.084
After PARK took over it's busy as hell.

16:51.168 --> 16:54.001
No crackdowns whatsoever.

16:54.626 --> 16:56.750
Goddamn bastards...

16:56.751 --> 17:00.626
When Yeon-hee was in charge,
they came by all the time.

17:01.168 --> 17:03.917
Haven't found her yet?

17:03.918 --> 17:07.250
I got a cop friend to look her
up, no credit card

17:07.251 --> 17:09.001
or car records,

17:10.209 --> 17:14.293
if it's over a month,
he said she could be dead.

17:14.501 --> 17:17.000
She's not someone who'd die so easily.

17:17.001 --> 17:21.042
She was still my girl!

17:21.043 --> 17:23.834
You still haven't snapped out!

17:24.126 --> 17:27.709
I told you,
she wiped you out and just took off.

17:28.251 --> 17:30.333
I'm sure you had some fun starting out,

17:30.334 --> 17:31.958
then when shit hits the fan,

17:31.959 --> 17:35.125
gold diggers take off.

17:35.126 --> 17:37.750
You were so clueless!

17:37.751 --> 17:41.126
You were like, "Yeon-hee! I love you!"

17:47.334 --> 17:48.543
Thank you.

17:50.251 --> 17:51.917
You're worried about me.

17:51.918 --> 17:52.751
I'm sorry.

17:52.752 --> 17:54.668
No, really.

17:55.084 --> 17:59.043
So I have something to tell you.

17:59.459 --> 18:01.278
You're trying to get me to do something!

18:02.793 --> 18:04.125
It's nothing like that.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.226
Come on...

18:05.709 --> 18:06.834
What is it?

18:08.668 --> 18:09.768
Carp!

18:10.876 --> 18:13.501
Carp, my brother!

18:14.293 --> 18:17.125
I baited a major sucker.

18:17.126 --> 18:19.668
I knew you were up to something!

18:19.793 --> 18:21.334
It was nice seeing you.

18:22.668 --> 18:23.958
We're family, man.

18:23.959 --> 18:25.958
You're distant cousin of distant cousin!

18:25.959 --> 18:29.709
People can't tell us
apart, don't you know that?

18:29.876 --> 18:31.709
You don't see your face in me?

18:37.251 --> 18:38.668
Forget it.

18:39.959 --> 18:43.876
100 large, all in cash.

18:45.668 --> 18:49.334
It's too much for me to handle alone.

18:50.001 --> 18:51.584
I'll have to take it all.

18:52.043 --> 18:55.500
What kind of idiot carries
around that much cash?

18:55.501 --> 18:57.876
I know, there is.

18:59.168 --> 19:01.168
It's definitely fishy.

19:02.293 --> 19:03.543
Indeed.

19:04.501 --> 19:07.209
That's why he can't report
it even if we take it.

19:07.918 --> 19:09.043
You getting it?

19:10.626 --> 19:13.834
You always bitch and
moan about your gambling debt.

19:14.209 --> 19:17.000
It's your chance to pay
all that back in one go.

19:17.001 --> 19:18.709
Too bad, forget it.

19:21.459 --> 19:23.251
What kind of sucker did you hook?

19:25.668 --> 19:29.668
He's my high school friend.

19:30.168 --> 19:34.458
He asked me to look for a way
out of the country

19:34.459 --> 19:38.126
after hitting big in Seoul
in exchange for a 20% cut.

19:38.918 --> 19:41.543
I'll bring him to him
to the port tomorrow,

19:41.709 --> 19:46.043
and when I signal you,
just walk away with the bag,

19:46.709 --> 19:49.959
then I'll take card of the rest.

19:58.876 --> 20:00.959
You sure this is legit?

20:02.376 --> 20:04.543
You worry too much.

20:04.584 --> 20:06.168
Worrying will get you killed.

20:06.501 --> 20:09.293
I worry because you make me worry.

20:10.418 --> 20:11.918
Don't you worry.

20:12.334 --> 20:14.125
I'll take care of you.

20:14.126 --> 20:16.251
You can't do shit on your own.

20:31.209 --> 20:32.668
You're late 3 minutes.

20:36.918 --> 20:40.292
Sorry, I had some problems at home...

20:40.293 --> 20:42.334
Who doesn't have problems at home?

20:42.834 --> 20:44.043
I told you,

20:44.834 --> 20:48.084
if you're late twice in a month,
you're fired.

20:48.251 --> 20:50.418
- Yes, I know.
- Also...

20:50.584 --> 20:53.208
soda runs low pretty quickly,

20:53.209 --> 20:54.668
do you know why?

20:58.709 --> 21:02.625
They're popular
because of the hot weather.

21:02.626 --> 21:05.751
Sales and order volumes don't match up.

21:06.876 --> 21:07.976
That's all.

21:08.543 --> 21:10.043
You better watch out.

21:10.293 --> 21:12.376
I shouldn't have hired the old one.

21:16.459 --> 21:17.043
I'm off.

21:17.044 --> 21:19.293
- Watch out, okay?
- Okay.

21:20.793 --> 21:22.417
- Oh yeah!
- What?

21:22.418 --> 21:25.459
Did anyone come for the bag?

21:25.668 --> 21:26.768
No.

21:27.501 --> 21:29.320
But there was a guy looking for someone.

21:29.418 --> 21:31.042
- Someone?
- Yes.

21:31.043 --> 21:32.834
Someone went missing near here.

21:33.168 --> 21:35.501
He left a flyer. Check it out.

21:36.084 --> 21:37.184
See you!

21:57.293 --> 21:59.501
I didn't text you for this.

22:00.918 --> 22:04.584
Liar, wasn't this what you were after?

22:05.126 --> 22:06.418
It wasn't.

22:08.251 --> 22:09.584
It felt good.

22:11.126 --> 22:12.226
Yeah?

22:15.293 --> 22:16.543
I have to go now.

22:22.126 --> 22:23.793
Do you have to work that job?

22:24.043 --> 22:26.918
Or will you give me money?

22:30.876 --> 22:32.084
What's that?

22:32.543 --> 22:34.584
Huh? What?

22:35.084 --> 22:36.501
Your husband did that to you?

22:36.793 --> 22:38.168
It's nothing like that.

22:43.043 --> 22:44.334
So it is.

22:44.751 --> 22:46.501
How could you live with him?

22:47.793 --> 22:48.893
Let go!

22:50.501 --> 22:52.043
It's not your concern.

23:00.418 --> 23:01.584
You know what?

23:01.751 --> 23:05.126
Woman beaters will never
change their habit.

23:07.626 --> 23:09.418
My fucking dad was like that.

23:09.668 --> 23:12.376
He was beating up my mom one day,

23:12.418 --> 23:14.084
so I stepped in.

23:14.334 --> 23:15.959
You know what's funny?

23:16.584 --> 23:19.126
Mom was the one who stopped me.

23:21.084 --> 23:22.459
I knew it then.

23:22.793 --> 23:25.626
I realized how scary getting
used to something is.

23:29.043 --> 23:33.043
Do you want to get beaten up
all your life like my mom?

23:35.501 --> 23:38.209
If not, end this quickly.

23:38.626 --> 23:42.668
"$500,000 - Death benefit"

23:49.126 --> 23:53.418
"Chapter 3: Chain"

24:05.543 --> 24:06.751
Dad, over here.

24:13.876 --> 24:16.250
I came from Seoul and
still got here earlier than you.

24:16.251 --> 24:17.959
I couldn't find a replacement.

24:19.334 --> 24:20.209
Sorry.

24:20.210 --> 24:21.708
Your work doesn't give you a break?

24:21.709 --> 24:22.959
Be quiet.

24:23.959 --> 24:25.251
What happened?

24:26.084 --> 24:29.543
I tried to stop mother
from going to the shop.

24:32.501 --> 24:34.293
Dammit...

24:36.001 --> 24:39.543
She went nuts,
saying I was trying to kill her.

24:40.459 --> 24:42.834
I can't do this anymore.

24:45.501 --> 24:46.709
I'm sorry.

24:48.793 --> 24:50.750
In order to identify

24:50.751 --> 24:52.376
the victim of body arts,

24:52.501 --> 24:56.209
the police are searching
the bars in town...

24:56.251 --> 24:58.251
When's that bitch coming?

24:58.959 --> 25:01.543
Could you stop calling her that?

25:01.584 --> 25:04.418
She pushed me on the stairs.

25:04.793 --> 25:06.708
What do you mean?

25:06.709 --> 25:09.583
She's the one who fell down the stairs!

25:09.584 --> 25:12.834
You didn't see how dangerous it was!

25:12.876 --> 25:16.543
She's like that to me
because you're so laxed.

25:45.918 --> 25:48.418
Why isn't this bastard answering me?

25:52.334 --> 25:53.434
"Carp"

25:55.251 --> 25:56.001
Yo, Carp.

25:56.251 --> 25:59.334
Not here yet? It's been so long!

25:59.626 --> 26:01.292
I can't reach him.

26:01.293 --> 26:02.584
Did he take off?

26:02.959 --> 26:04.250
Maybe he pretended to come here

26:04.251 --> 26:06.376
to divert the cops away from him.

26:06.418 --> 26:08.668
No, he only trusts me.

26:08.709 --> 26:09.809
Dude.

26:10.043 --> 26:14.876
Those with big money don't trust others.

26:15.001 --> 26:16.084
Shouldn't trust anyone either.

26:16.085 --> 26:18.667
- But he's totally...
- Whatever.

26:18.668 --> 26:21.168
I gotta head back, I'm hanging up.

26:21.209 --> 26:24.084
Hey, wait a bit longer! Son of a...

26:26.251 --> 26:28.918
Where the hell did he go?

26:31.626 --> 26:32.959
Excuse me.

26:35.001 --> 26:35.918
Yes?

26:36.001 --> 26:37.834
I'm a cop.

26:38.459 --> 26:40.668
I see. How can I help you?

26:40.918 --> 26:43.543
Do you know this man?

26:43.626 --> 26:45.709
His name is OH Dong-pal.

26:46.668 --> 26:47.959
I don't really know.

26:48.876 --> 26:52.668
Where could he be?

26:54.376 --> 26:56.375
Thank you.

26:56.376 --> 26:58.168
Okay, take care.

26:59.334 --> 27:00.434
Wait a minute.

27:02.334 --> 27:05.126
You sure you don't know him?

27:09.501 --> 27:11.918
- I don't...
- Mr. KANG.

27:12.251 --> 27:14.418
Didn't you go to Pyeongtaek High?

27:15.126 --> 27:18.042
Which year? I wrote it down.

27:18.043 --> 27:21.584
I'm from PH too, class of '85.

27:21.751 --> 27:22.584
Look

27:22.585 --> 27:26.042
KANG Tae-young, '90, OH Dong-pal, '90 too.

27:26.043 --> 27:30.126
You were classmates,
you didn't know each other?

27:31.001 --> 27:34.208
OH Dong-pal? I don't really know...

27:34.209 --> 27:36.459
It's raining.

27:36.793 --> 27:37.918
One second.

27:39.793 --> 27:40.893
What the hell?

27:43.459 --> 27:46.501
Where the hell did OH go?

27:47.626 --> 27:49.834
It's nice bumping into alum.

27:49.876 --> 27:51.543
Good to meet you, sir.

27:53.084 --> 27:56.459
So this OH Dong-pal is my friend Dong-pal.

27:56.751 --> 27:58.501
I didn't recognize him like this.

27:59.209 --> 28:01.126
Did he really pull a scam?

28:02.209 --> 28:04.418
He was a model student.

28:06.293 --> 28:09.876
I understand your position.

28:11.334 --> 28:15.626
It's awful to think that
your friend is a wanted man.

28:16.209 --> 28:17.834
I'd hide it too.

28:20.543 --> 28:22.168
Did he ever contact you?

28:23.543 --> 28:24.643
What?

28:27.209 --> 28:29.084
No, never.

28:31.793 --> 28:35.668
We've never kept in touch,

28:35.876 --> 28:38.876
if my number comes up on his phone,
then I...

28:41.501 --> 28:43.876
Have you checked his call log?

28:44.084 --> 28:45.184
Already did.

28:45.793 --> 28:48.250
I think he's using a burner phone.

28:48.251 --> 28:50.668
Burner phone?

28:51.876 --> 28:54.209
He really is in deep.

28:55.084 --> 28:58.751
Anyway, he has never contacted me.

28:59.709 --> 29:04.459
If you don't believe me,
check it out yourself.

29:06.376 --> 29:07.476
It's okay.

29:08.084 --> 29:10.168
Even if he called,
you probably deleted it.

29:13.793 --> 29:16.459
- Let's take a selfie.
- What?

29:19.001 --> 29:20.209
Smile.

29:21.709 --> 29:22.959
That's good.

29:25.834 --> 29:27.126
Are you married?

29:27.543 --> 29:28.643
Nope.

29:28.918 --> 29:30.043
Girlfriend?

29:31.251 --> 29:32.351
None.

29:32.959 --> 29:36.418
You look handsome enough,
what do you live for?

29:36.876 --> 29:39.501
Enjoy life, have some fun.

29:41.001 --> 29:42.101
Okay.

29:49.209 --> 29:51.334
How did you know my number?

29:52.043 --> 29:53.626
That's not even work.

29:55.168 --> 29:57.209
Let's bar hop.

29:58.584 --> 30:00.418
Know any hot bars in town?

30:01.709 --> 30:03.125
I'm done for the night...

30:03.126 --> 30:04.543
Gonna go home?

30:06.626 --> 30:08.751
No, let's go.

30:09.543 --> 30:10.668
Nice!

30:12.918 --> 30:14.501
One second.

30:18.293 --> 30:20.293
Sergeant, did you get anything?

30:21.626 --> 30:22.793
It's OH Dong-pal?

30:23.126 --> 30:24.668
Understood, hold on.

30:25.709 --> 30:29.000
Why don't you do your thing?

30:29.001 --> 30:30.250
I got work to do.

30:30.251 --> 30:32.543
- I see.
- And, uh...

30:32.959 --> 30:34.376
Thanks for the meal.

30:35.001 --> 30:36.209
Okay...

30:39.709 --> 30:41.083
Let me use this umbrella?

30:41.084 --> 30:42.184
- Sure.
- Thanks!

30:48.126 --> 30:49.334
Son of a bitch.

30:50.834 --> 30:53.126
He had to eat just the expensive ones?

30:56.376 --> 30:58.376
"PARK Du-man"

30:58.959 --> 31:01.459
Jesus Christ...

31:10.293 --> 31:11.393
He looks like a fucker.

31:14.543 --> 31:17.418
I'll take care of it, so get some sleep.

31:19.251 --> 31:21.043
Without this fucker

31:21.834 --> 31:23.668
We'll be happy.

32:03.501 --> 32:04.601
Mom!

32:34.168 --> 32:36.293
Hello, good evening!

32:36.668 --> 32:38.417
It's very last minute,

32:38.418 --> 32:39.334
but I think I'll be late.

32:39.335 --> 32:40.918
Ah Shit

32:41.293 --> 32:44.084
I told you, late 2 times,
and you're fired.

32:44.126 --> 32:45.376
I'm really sorry.

32:45.834 --> 32:47.000
I'll get there as soon as possible.

32:47.001 --> 32:49.084
Forget it, don't come.

32:49.209 --> 32:50.309
What?

32:50.543 --> 32:53.250
Don't come in, you're fired.

32:53.251 --> 32:56.918
Wait, I'll be honest with you.

32:57.543 --> 32:59.376
My mother is not well.

33:00.626 --> 33:02.667
And my wife's not well too.

33:02.668 --> 33:07.625
How many times do I have to tell you?
Everyone has problems at home.

33:07.626 --> 33:09.500
- Forget it!
- It's not so simple...

33:09.501 --> 33:10.959
No need to come in anymore.

33:11.001 --> 33:11.793
What a moron.

33:11.959 --> 33:13.126
Hello?

33:14.001 --> 33:15.101
Hello?

33:24.001 --> 33:25.459
Dammit.

33:27.584 --> 33:28.834
Fuck, the bag!

33:41.834 --> 33:45.293
It's called Navi Bar by the station,

33:45.793 --> 33:47.667
he usually drinks alone

33:47.668 --> 33:50.376
and comes home at 2 or 3 AM.

34:40.126 --> 34:42.043
"Jin-tae"

34:44.043 --> 34:45.209
I did it.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.834
I killed him!

34:53.459 --> 34:54.668
Did you hear me?

34:54.834 --> 34:57.251
He's dead, your hubby is dead!

34:57.876 --> 35:00.209
I hear you fine, lower your voice.

35:00.543 --> 35:02.793
It's okay, I'm in my car.

35:03.584 --> 35:04.684
Where are you now?

35:05.459 --> 35:06.751
On the way from Mt. Mubong.

35:07.626 --> 35:08.726
What for?

35:09.418 --> 35:10.918
I buried him there.

35:11.501 --> 35:12.834
Buried him?

35:14.084 --> 35:16.084
I told you it had to be a car accident.

35:16.376 --> 35:17.918
Something came up.

35:18.584 --> 35:22.001
I'll call you back later,
my battery's almost dead.

35:22.084 --> 35:23.293
Wait...

35:31.251 --> 35:32.351
Shit...

35:32.376 --> 35:34.500
"Insurance policy
for the missing personal cases"

35:34.501 --> 35:38.251
declared dead 5 years
after missing report...

35:41.043 --> 35:43.584
How am I supposed to wait 5 years?

36:09.001 --> 36:10.418
Did you see a ghost?

36:26.418 --> 36:29.334
Come, sit over here, right here.

36:29.834 --> 36:32.501
Oh my.

36:34.418 --> 36:35.543
So.

36:37.834 --> 36:39.293
I heard you got a sucker.

36:40.709 --> 36:42.293
- Sucker?
- Yes.

36:43.043 --> 36:44.251
What sucker?

36:44.543 --> 36:46.180
I heard a ton of money is coming in.

36:47.209 --> 36:49.918
Summer bonus!

36:49.959 --> 36:52.543
I received a puny bonus, you know that.

36:52.959 --> 36:54.667
Mr. dear officer...

36:54.668 --> 36:58.417
You're the best at playing dumb.

36:58.418 --> 36:59.518
Iichiban!

37:02.043 --> 37:03.417
Yo, Carp.

37:03.418 --> 37:04.876
You said so, didn't you?

37:05.251 --> 37:08.209
That he found a sucker with a ton of cash.

37:09.251 --> 37:10.209
You told me so, haven't you?

37:10.209 --> 37:11.309
I never said that...

37:11.334 --> 37:14.333
You punk ass bitch,
don't lie to me, asshole!

37:14.334 --> 37:15.793
I'll cut off your tongue!

37:17.709 --> 37:20.209
Mr. PARK, Mr. PARK!

37:20.584 --> 37:24.625
You know how hard I'm trying
to get you that money.

37:24.626 --> 37:29.250
And it hasn't been a week
since we made that promise.

37:29.251 --> 37:31.043
Look, right?

37:34.584 --> 37:37.209
- Carp, come here.
- Yes, sir.

37:43.668 --> 37:46.083
Do you know what you just did, asshole?

37:46.084 --> 37:50.001
You tricked our innocent
and kind Mr. Port Officer.

37:50.126 --> 37:52.251
Did you hear what he said?

37:52.918 --> 37:56.042
He said he'll pay back even if

37:56.043 --> 37:57.750
his intestines are spilling out.

37:57.751 --> 38:01.542
How could you mock someone like him?

38:01.543 --> 38:05.126
That's why you're no better than a carp.

38:09.543 --> 38:11.043
Isn't that right?

38:11.084 --> 38:12.184
Sure.

38:14.418 --> 38:16.001
What are you doing?

38:16.709 --> 38:19.293
Come beg for his forgiveness.

38:22.001 --> 38:23.459
I'm sorry...

38:24.293 --> 38:25.792
I'm so sorry, sir...

38:25.793 --> 38:30.583
No, no, this isn't good enough.

38:30.584 --> 38:32.042
- What?
- Right.

38:32.043 --> 38:35.751
This is the perfect
opportunity to take a wrist.

38:35.918 --> 38:37.237
- Wrist?
- Let's chop one off.

38:37.584 --> 38:39.084
Boss, I'm sorry!

38:42.459 --> 38:45.375
He's right!

38:45.376 --> 38:47.209
He's right about the sucker!

38:47.293 --> 38:48.543
I told Carp about it!

38:49.626 --> 38:51.126
You only told him about it?

38:51.501 --> 38:53.918
So Carp wasn't lying?

38:55.168 --> 38:56.334
I don't think so.

38:56.459 --> 38:57.793
You don't think so?

38:58.751 --> 39:00.126
He didn't lie!

39:01.376 --> 39:04.042
Sir, what's all this for?

39:04.043 --> 39:07.458
Then I owe Carp a major apology!

39:07.459 --> 39:10.583
Why are you making me into a bad guy?

39:10.584 --> 39:12.251
Let him go.

39:12.293 --> 39:15.126
He gets so enthusiastic
when he holds a knife.

39:15.459 --> 39:17.793
I'm sorry, boss...

39:21.793 --> 39:22.959
So what then?

39:26.001 --> 39:28.334
When do we reel in the sucker?

39:28.376 --> 39:29.476
What?

39:37.626 --> 39:39.418
What will you do now?

39:39.501 --> 39:40.876
Isn't it obvious?

39:41.626 --> 39:43.251
We gotta find the sucker.

39:44.459 --> 39:47.833
He's long gone! We can't find him!

39:47.834 --> 39:48.934
Carp.

39:55.126 --> 39:57.209
This cop came from Seoul to get him.

39:57.418 --> 39:59.209
He's a big snake,

39:59.376 --> 40:02.084
and he's going around asking about him.

40:02.584 --> 40:05.751
Why don't you follow him around?

40:06.209 --> 40:08.793
He'll definitely get some info on him.

40:09.084 --> 40:11.876
Now you're asking me to follow a cop?!

40:12.209 --> 40:13.625
He already knows my face!

40:13.626 --> 40:14.668
What the shit!

40:14.669 --> 40:16.292
We don't have a lot of choices!

40:16.293 --> 40:19.417
There is no 'us'! Leave me out of this!

40:19.418 --> 40:21.333
I'm begging you!

40:21.334 --> 40:23.668
Didn't you hear what Mr. PARK said?

40:23.918 --> 40:27.667
He put our hands together,
and said to get the sucker!

40:27.668 --> 40:29.918
Just stop it! Please!

40:34.876 --> 40:35.976
Carp.

40:38.001 --> 40:39.168
Don't worry.

40:40.834 --> 40:44.959
Do you know why I only smoke this?

40:46.376 --> 40:50.251
I was out with a colleague
on illegal aliens crackdown.

40:50.793 --> 40:53.084
Then I ran out of smokes.

40:53.626 --> 40:55.543
He said I could smoke his.

40:56.834 --> 41:00.168
But I craved Lucky Strike for some reason.

41:00.376 --> 41:02.251
A pack of Lucky Strike, please.

41:02.959 --> 41:05.876
Then out of nowhere,
a dump truck ran over the car.

41:19.793 --> 41:22.376
If I wasn't for Lucky strike,

41:23.001 --> 41:25.626
I'd be dead like him.

41:26.709 --> 41:28.501
This is the only thing

41:28.876 --> 41:32.543
that protected me, not God or ancestors.

41:34.876 --> 41:37.001
Fuck...

41:44.459 --> 41:46.251
The phone you're trying to call...

42:04.626 --> 42:07.626
A congratulatory gift.
Picked it up on the way...

42:13.084 --> 42:15.251
Then who did I kill?

42:15.668 --> 42:16.768
How should I know?

42:16.959 --> 42:20.167
Oh shit... It was sure it was him!

42:20.168 --> 42:22.418
No, it was someone else!

42:23.376 --> 42:27.043
Your dead man is snoring in my apartment.

42:27.751 --> 42:29.751
See it for yourself
if you don't believe me!

42:36.543 --> 42:38.959
Fucking son of a bitch

42:44.543 --> 42:45.709
What should I do now?

42:50.668 --> 42:55.626
You have to get rid of this car
and head back to China.

42:58.168 --> 43:00.043
Then I Won't get to see you.

43:01.418 --> 43:05.251
I'll wrap things up here
and follow you there.

43:05.959 --> 43:08.751
Let's just leave now then.

43:10.501 --> 43:12.459
Speak some sense.

43:13.293 --> 43:14.543
You got any money?

43:16.293 --> 43:18.709
We'll need money to live.

43:20.126 --> 43:22.584
I'll make some no matter what,

43:23.543 --> 43:25.209
so you head over there first.

43:49.918 --> 43:51.751
Dammit!

43:52.168 --> 43:53.751
Crazy bastard!

43:55.334 --> 43:56.918
Fucking idiot...

44:02.001 --> 44:03.918
That's 2 for $1.

44:04.126 --> 44:06.209
This one is $1.

44:15.793 --> 44:16.893
Good evening!

44:17.543 --> 44:18.959
$3, please.

44:19.918 --> 44:20.876
Good to see you.

44:20.877 --> 44:22.418
- Hello there.
- Take care.

44:22.501 --> 44:24.626
- Hello.
- Hey there.

44:25.501 --> 44:27.709
- Are you new?
- Yes.

44:27.751 --> 44:30.250
- I used to work here.
- I see.

44:30.251 --> 44:32.501
- I came to get my stuff.
- Okay.

44:33.043 --> 44:36.083
It's in the storage,
I need the key for it.

44:36.084 --> 44:36.626
The key?

44:36.627 --> 44:38.293
Yes, for the storage.

44:38.709 --> 44:41.293
- It's...
- It should be hanging there.

44:45.209 --> 44:46.251
Is this it?

44:46.252 --> 44:47.708
Yeah, that's the one.

44:47.709 --> 44:48.876
Thank you.

44:50.126 --> 44:51.750
Is the manager not in yet?

44:51.751 --> 44:53.500
No, he hasn't come yet.

44:53.501 --> 44:55.918
I wanted to say hello.

45:18.751 --> 45:22.084
I wanted to ask you,
have you seen this man?

45:22.334 --> 45:24.418
It's my first day today, so I don't know

45:24.751 --> 45:25.851
Thanks again.

45:26.668 --> 45:29.333
You should ask him, he used to work here.

45:29.334 --> 45:30.750
- Excuse me!
- Is that right?

45:30.751 --> 45:31.876
One moment please.

45:31.959 --> 45:34.834
Excuse me, we're the police.

45:35.126 --> 45:36.168
Hello.

45:36.169 --> 45:37.668
Have you seen him before?

45:38.918 --> 45:39.793
No.

45:39.794 --> 45:41.626
Please look carefully.

45:44.334 --> 45:46.917
I've never seen him in my life.

45:46.918 --> 45:49.668
Is that so? Okay, thank you.

45:51.209 --> 45:53.875
Besides that man,
are there any other employees here?

45:53.876 --> 45:56.293
Manager and a few patr-timers.

45:56.501 --> 45:58.543
Could I get the manager's number?

46:11.668 --> 46:14.376
I told you not to come in.

46:14.876 --> 46:15.976
What are you doing here?

46:16.334 --> 46:18.168
I came to get my stuff.

46:20.043 --> 46:21.334
You had that much stuff?

46:21.751 --> 46:24.459
Yes, I had some books here.

46:26.168 --> 46:27.987
You've been reading books while working.

46:28.709 --> 46:32.709
That's why we get bad service reviews.

46:33.918 --> 46:35.334
Where the hell is it?

46:35.793 --> 46:36.893
Wait a minute.

46:38.418 --> 46:39.668
Could I look at that?

46:40.543 --> 46:41.334
What?

46:41.335 --> 46:44.293
I'm suddenly curious what books you read.

46:45.418 --> 46:46.751
They're novels.

46:48.293 --> 46:49.393
Novels?

46:50.251 --> 46:51.351
Yes.

46:51.959 --> 46:53.709
Let me see it, just in case.

46:55.959 --> 46:57.209
Just in case what?

46:58.043 --> 46:59.876
Suspecting me of something?

47:00.209 --> 47:01.251
Feeling guilty?

47:01.252 --> 47:02.751
For what?

47:03.376 --> 47:06.126
I got nothing like that.

47:06.168 --> 47:07.750
Let me see it then!

47:07.751 --> 47:09.542
No, I got no reason to!

47:09.543 --> 47:11.208
I'll look at it because I want to see it!

47:11.209 --> 47:13.126
Why the hell for?!

47:16.918 --> 47:18.876
You still think I'm your employee?!

47:20.084 --> 47:22.001
Don't talk down at me!

47:23.084 --> 47:25.251
I've had it with you, kid!

47:26.959 --> 47:28.334
You got no manners!

47:32.751 --> 47:33.851
Behave yourself.

47:34.709 --> 47:38.251
Keep it up and I'll report you

47:39.001 --> 47:41.750
for skipping work to golf

47:41.751 --> 47:42.851
with female customers.

47:48.918 --> 47:50.251
By the way,

47:51.251 --> 47:56.168
I was the hardest working
and most ethical employee!

47:57.084 --> 47:58.184
Did you know?!

48:56.209 --> 48:58.668
I'll consider this
as your last chance to me.

49:03.001 --> 49:08.418
"Chapter 4: Shark"

49:11.084 --> 49:12.833
Get your shit together,
do you know who I am?

49:12.834 --> 49:15.501
My apologies sir,
she's not the one we confirmed to go.

49:16.043 --> 49:17.209
What is it?

49:18.084 --> 49:19.292
He's Mi-ran's regular,

49:19.293 --> 49:21.668
he wants a drink with her...

49:22.459 --> 49:24.501
She's not taking any clients today.

49:26.918 --> 49:28.084
Who are you?

49:30.334 --> 49:32.209
I'm the boss here,

49:33.043 --> 49:34.793
do I have to do this?

49:36.501 --> 49:38.125
Sir, let's not stay here...

49:38.126 --> 49:40.334
Don't fucking touch me.

49:43.626 --> 49:45.168
You're the boss?

49:46.251 --> 49:50.126
You treat your customers like fucktards?

49:52.626 --> 49:54.251
Being a boss isn't all that.

49:55.043 --> 49:56.334
You fucking bitch!

49:58.834 --> 50:00.251
You hit me first.

50:04.584 --> 50:05.684
Get rid of him.

50:07.293 --> 50:08.393
Come with me.

50:11.668 --> 50:13.418
Go on, get rid of him.

50:20.459 --> 50:21.709
Drink.

50:28.918 --> 50:30.543
When did he start beating you?

50:38.168 --> 50:39.501
Got anyone to help?

50:43.001 --> 50:44.126
Pitiful girl...

50:47.793 --> 50:49.376
Stay at a hospital for a few days.

50:49.876 --> 50:51.000
No, it's okay.

50:51.001 --> 50:52.126
Take it.

50:52.459 --> 50:53.959
I know how you feel.

50:54.459 --> 50:56.293
My dead husband was a beater too.

50:57.793 --> 51:02.043
When you need help, call me anytime, okay?

51:03.709 --> 51:04.809
Okay.

51:14.459 --> 51:16.334
Hey, open the door.

51:28.834 --> 51:29.934
What's wrong?

51:30.168 --> 51:32.334
What do you mean you'll go to the police?

51:32.959 --> 51:34.376
I can't sleep.

51:36.459 --> 51:37.918
I keep hearing things...

51:39.584 --> 51:43.543
I hear voice of the man
I killed in my ears.

51:43.793 --> 51:45.584
Don't say weird things.

51:45.626 --> 51:46.726
I'm serious!

51:50.334 --> 51:51.626
I'm going nuts!

51:53.418 --> 51:55.334
I'm really going insane!

52:02.834 --> 52:05.626
I can't stand this,
I should turn myself in

52:08.501 --> 52:10.501
Do you think it only concerns yourself?

52:11.168 --> 52:13.918
I won't tell anything about you,
don't worry

52:17.918 --> 52:20.709
I think that man's soul
is possessing me...

52:21.084 --> 52:22.667
I can't live like this...

52:22.668 --> 52:26.209
Jin-tae, how about this?

52:27.084 --> 52:30.751
Let's hold a memorial
service for the dead man.

52:31.418 --> 52:32.959
A memorial service?

52:33.751 --> 52:36.918
Since he died begrudgingly,

52:37.126 --> 52:38.918
we'll bless him.

52:39.709 --> 52:42.918
Then maybe he won't bother you anymore.

52:45.584 --> 52:49.501
So? Feeling better?

52:50.834 --> 52:54.542
Yeah, I think I'm better.

52:54.543 --> 52:58.126
Really? Are you really okay?

52:59.209 --> 53:00.309
Yeah.

53:13.209 --> 53:14.876
Fucking moron...

53:19.376 --> 53:20.626
What is it now?

53:21.168 --> 53:22.626
I still hear him...

53:23.584 --> 53:25.501
What weak ass.

53:26.709 --> 53:28.500
Whose fault is it?

53:28.501 --> 53:30.638
It's because you asked
me to kill your husband!

53:31.084 --> 53:32.184
Me?

53:32.626 --> 53:34.001
When did I?

53:34.334 --> 53:36.417
You insisted on killing him, no?

53:36.418 --> 53:38.833
Then you went and killed a random guy.

53:38.834 --> 53:42.126
I'm in a bigger mess because of you.

53:42.668 --> 53:44.959
So shut the hell up and get in the car!

53:48.418 --> 53:50.251
Where are you going?

53:50.793 --> 53:52.084
Police station.

53:52.168 --> 53:53.268
What?

53:57.126 --> 53:58.501
Jin-tae!

54:00.168 --> 54:03.168
I don't fucking believe this!

54:41.918 --> 54:43.709
Fucking moron!

54:51.209 --> 54:54.501
What do I do? What am I gonna do?

55:04.209 --> 55:08.751
"Boss"

55:20.626 --> 55:21.726
Miran?

55:24.501 --> 55:26.501
Aren't you working today?

55:53.043 --> 55:54.584
Did you bury the body properly?

55:56.959 --> 55:58.059
So?

56:00.084 --> 56:01.793
What do you want to do?

56:04.293 --> 56:05.709
I don't Know...

56:13.209 --> 56:17.751
No one will look for an illegal alien.

56:21.209 --> 56:22.751
Did you like him?

56:24.168 --> 56:25.293
No.

56:25.626 --> 56:27.292
That's fine, then.

56:27.293 --> 56:29.917
Even if it wasn't you,
he'd have died soon enough.

56:29.918 --> 56:31.334
It's already done.

56:36.959 --> 56:38.125
Follow me with the car.

56:38.126 --> 56:39.418
Where?

56:40.168 --> 56:41.751
Gotta get rid of it.

56:50.251 --> 56:51.615
Please take a good card of it.

57:07.626 --> 57:09.668
They'll get rid of the car.

57:12.793 --> 57:14.334
Let's get you washed up.

57:26.293 --> 57:28.084
Wanna hear something?

57:28.918 --> 57:31.543
There's a shark called sand tiger shark,

57:31.626 --> 57:34.543
it bears 50 or so eggs when it's pregnant.

57:35.834 --> 57:37.626
What's scary is that,

57:38.501 --> 57:42.084
the babies eat each other
in the mother's belly.

57:43.209 --> 57:47.293
Only one will be born,
and it becomes a fierce predator.

57:50.293 --> 57:51.393
You know what?

57:52.959 --> 57:56.709
Autopsy rate for accidents
is only 4% in Korea.

57:58.043 --> 58:00.418
Autopsy wasn't done on my husband's body.

58:03.251 --> 58:04.626
Is your husband insured?

58:06.043 --> 58:07.143
Yes.

58:08.251 --> 58:09.668
Think carefully.

58:11.376 --> 58:12.501
About what?

58:12.834 --> 58:14.126
Look at you.

58:14.668 --> 58:16.626
Aren't you seeing this through?

58:17.876 --> 58:20.334
Once is hard, twice is easy.

58:29.334 --> 58:32.168
What? You want one too?

58:39.459 --> 58:41.584
Do exactly as I tell you.

58:41.751 --> 58:43.626
There's no room for 2 mistakes.

58:44.251 --> 58:46.043
Come up with a solid alibi.

58:47.251 --> 58:51.376
Depression and over drinking
will be the causes of his death.

58:52.251 --> 58:55.251
There'll be fewer problems
when getting the monry.

58:56.751 --> 58:59.917
Say you found him when
you returned from work.

58:59.918 --> 59:03.168
My husband...
Could you send an ambulance right away?

59:03.209 --> 59:05.875
Your mind will go blank
and you'll be confused.

59:05.876 --> 59:08.334
My address is...

59:11.584 --> 59:14.584
The police investigation will begin.

59:16.334 --> 59:19.709
Don't forget that
the husband you loved died so suddenly.

59:20.668 --> 59:22.334
He was...

59:24.293 --> 59:27.168
having a hard time because of the debt...

59:28.959 --> 59:31.334
But I told him we'd go
through this together...

59:33.376 --> 59:35.251
The investigation won't end in 1 session.

59:37.584 --> 59:39.251
Stay alert until the end.

59:44.793 --> 59:48.543
After the investigation,
make sure to cremate him.

59:49.168 --> 59:51.001
So it won't cause trouble.

59:52.418 --> 59:53.584
Next page...

59:56.251 --> 1:00:00.709
Sign that and you'll get your big payout.

1:00:04.834 --> 1:00:07.001
And you'll be reborn.

1:00:31.959 --> 1:00:33.126
By the way...

1:00:33.251 --> 1:00:36.251
will I be okay leaving by myself tomorrow?

1:00:36.543 --> 1:00:39.043
I know someone at Pyeongtaek Lake.

1:00:39.126 --> 1:00:41.959
He knows you're getting on
the 8:30 boat to Chungdo.

1:00:42.709 --> 1:00:43.809
Okay...

1:00:44.209 --> 1:00:46.001
And this.

1:00:52.126 --> 1:00:54.168
I didn't help you for this.

1:00:58.709 --> 1:00:59.809
Here.

1:01:00.418 --> 1:01:01.709
What's this?

1:01:03.209 --> 1:01:04.834
The man your Chinese friend killed.

1:01:07.043 --> 1:01:11.418
He had a rape charge. Goddamn trash.

1:01:14.918 --> 1:01:16.376
Forget the past.

1:01:16.584 --> 1:01:18.834
You're restarting your life.

1:01:21.043 --> 1:01:23.834
Smile, you're allowed.

1:01:24.668 --> 1:01:25.834
It's all over.

1:01:56.793 --> 1:01:57.893
You're awake?

1:02:00.918 --> 1:02:02.876
I guess I didn't put enough sedative.

1:02:07.376 --> 1:02:09.251
I'm sorry for everything.

1:02:10.876 --> 1:02:12.626
Don't feel too bad.

1:02:13.001 --> 1:02:17.209
You killed 3 people after all.

1:02:26.126 --> 1:02:29.251
You can't trust anyone with a ton money.

1:02:29.459 --> 1:02:30.626
Not even your parents.

1:02:44.668 --> 1:02:49.084
"Chapter 5: Luck Strike"

1:02:50.251 --> 1:02:51.875
He came to your shop before dawn?

1:02:51.876 --> 1:02:54.251
Yeah, that cop you mentioned.

1:02:54.751 --> 1:02:57.334
He was being super grabby.

1:02:57.501 --> 1:03:00.001
I felt dirty watching that prick.

1:03:00.168 --> 1:03:02.625
The sucker was an excuse,

1:03:02.626 --> 1:03:03.793
he came to have fun.

1:03:03.959 --> 1:03:06.208
He definitely went there
to dig into my background.

1:03:06.209 --> 1:03:08.125
Of all the bars in town,

1:03:08.126 --> 1:03:09.833
why'd he go there?

1:03:09.834 --> 1:03:12.708
Anyway, he tried to convince
the girl to go fuck,

1:03:12.709 --> 1:03:15.418
but got rejected and went to a sauna.

1:03:16.543 --> 1:03:17.293
And then?

1:03:17.294 --> 1:03:18.584
I don't know.

1:03:19.793 --> 1:03:21.000
That sounded like a boast.

1:03:21.001 --> 1:03:23.168
I had something to do
and couldn't follow him.

1:03:23.418 --> 1:03:24.168
Carp!

1:03:24.169 --> 1:03:26.417
Don't you know what's important right now?

1:03:26.418 --> 1:03:29.292
I'm using my free time to help you out!

1:03:29.293 --> 1:03:31.375
If I'm not good enough, do it yourself!

1:03:31.376 --> 1:03:34.543
Come on, of course not!
You're doing amazing.

1:03:34.959 --> 1:03:37.333
Carp, just one more day.

1:03:37.334 --> 1:03:38.750
I'll give you 30%.

1:03:38.751 --> 1:03:41.042
Bro, the cop's at the bar.

1:03:41.043 --> 1:03:41.918
What?

1:03:42.084 --> 1:03:43.543
I'll talk to you later.

1:03:43.751 --> 1:03:46.251
Hello? Carp? Dammit...

1:03:47.751 --> 1:03:50.501
Cop? For what?

1:03:51.418 --> 1:03:53.334
Frigging hell...

1:04:21.501 --> 1:04:22.601
Hey!

1:04:22.751 --> 1:04:24.876
Ow, that's hot, you're right on time.

1:04:25.709 --> 1:04:27.459
I made your favorite.

1:04:29.876 --> 1:04:31.125
Isn't the place clean?

1:04:31.126 --> 1:04:32.543
How could you!

1:04:33.334 --> 1:04:34.501
Because of you!

1:04:34.709 --> 1:04:37.834
Let's talk over dinner, okay?

1:04:46.918 --> 1:04:48.376
Sit.

1:04:58.918 --> 1:05:01.418
Did you not even feed yourself
while you were away?

1:05:02.959 --> 1:05:04.667
You look thin.

1:05:04.668 --> 1:05:06.759
You didn't eat properly
because I wasn't here?

1:05:09.168 --> 1:05:10.759
Are you even listening to yourself?

1:05:14.709 --> 1:05:16.334
I had a reason to be away.

1:05:17.251 --> 1:05:20.168
So tell me what that is!

1:05:20.959 --> 1:05:23.376
I know you had it tough because of me!

1:05:33.626 --> 1:05:35.083
I dabbled in different things

1:05:35.084 --> 1:05:37.251
but it wasn't so easy.

1:05:41.251 --> 1:05:43.209
So why are you back here?

1:05:46.584 --> 1:05:49.251
You're the only one I have.

1:05:54.543 --> 1:05:55.668
Jeez...

1:06:02.459 --> 1:06:03.778
If you want me to go, I will.

1:06:07.126 --> 1:06:08.226
Eh?

1:06:09.626 --> 1:06:11.084
Are you serious?

1:06:12.751 --> 1:06:13.851
Hey!

1:06:19.251 --> 1:06:20.501
Don't go please!

1:06:32.959 --> 1:06:35.001
I've been thinking,

1:06:36.793 --> 1:06:39.209
I can't come out of this clean.

1:06:44.626 --> 1:06:46.793
I'm thinking of going
to my aunt's in Japan.

1:06:47.376 --> 1:06:49.584
I got some savings in the bank there.

1:06:50.709 --> 1:06:52.793
Ask her to send it right away.

1:06:52.834 --> 1:06:55.459
It's under my name,
I have to do it myself.

1:06:58.459 --> 1:07:00.626
I actually need your help.

1:07:02.876 --> 1:07:03.976
With what?

1:07:08.418 --> 1:07:10.584
I borrowed a friend's ID.

1:07:14.001 --> 1:07:16.411
Make sure there's no problem
when I leave the country.

1:07:28.001 --> 1:07:29.101
SEO Mi-ran?

1:07:30.334 --> 1:07:32.918
My new name, you like it?

1:07:37.334 --> 1:07:38.709
Are you...

1:07:39.876 --> 1:07:43.625
trying to change your identity
for the passport?

1:07:43.626 --> 1:07:46.084
Are you nuts? I just borrowed it.

1:07:50.501 --> 1:07:52.501
You came here for this.

1:08:01.459 --> 1:08:02.559
What?

1:08:04.084 --> 1:08:05.709
Do I still look like a sucker?

1:08:06.334 --> 1:08:08.016
Your tricks don't work on me anymore.

1:08:14.584 --> 1:08:15.918
Are you serious?

1:08:21.168 --> 1:08:22.268
Who's that?

1:08:27.751 --> 1:08:28.851
Who is it?

1:08:29.251 --> 1:08:30.584
It's me, YOO Myung-gu!

1:08:31.043 --> 1:08:32.168
That goddamn bastard!

1:08:32.543 --> 1:08:33.643
Who's YOO Myung-gu?

1:08:33.751 --> 1:08:36.833
It's this guy...

1:08:36.834 --> 1:08:38.208
He's a cop from Seoul.

1:08:38.209 --> 1:08:38.751
What?!

1:08:38.793 --> 1:08:40.209
I'll take care of it,

1:08:40.918 --> 1:08:42.959
stay here quietly, okay?

1:08:43.709 --> 1:08:46.876
Stupid snake, why is he here?

1:08:48.876 --> 1:08:51.168
What brings you...

1:08:51.251 --> 1:08:56.209
I felt bad about not
even paying for the sushi...

1:08:56.334 --> 1:08:59.458
It's all right.

1:08:59.459 --> 1:09:01.542
I brought some stuff
that we can eat together.

1:09:01.543 --> 1:09:04.209
I was told you got off work early.

1:09:04.334 --> 1:09:08.126
I have a guest and my place is a mess...

1:09:08.418 --> 1:09:09.668
Guest?

1:09:11.876 --> 1:09:12.976
Girlfriend?

1:09:13.584 --> 1:09:14.684
Yes.

1:09:14.793 --> 1:09:16.334
You said you didn't have one.

1:09:17.418 --> 1:09:19.001
You got one since then?

1:09:19.251 --> 1:09:21.209
Back then...

1:09:21.251 --> 1:09:23.084
Ow, my bladder...

1:09:23.668 --> 1:09:25.333
I had some beer earlier,

1:09:25.334 --> 1:09:26.958
I really gotta pee, one sec.

1:09:26.959 --> 1:09:28.959
There's public washroom...

1:09:29.501 --> 1:09:31.834
I gotta pee...

1:09:35.501 --> 1:09:36.601
Good evening.

1:09:38.209 --> 1:09:41.334
Eh? She's a hottie!

1:09:45.084 --> 1:09:46.184
Washroom's there.

1:09:46.543 --> 1:09:50.834
"Clouds gather in the blue sky,"

1:09:50.918 --> 1:09:55.293
"be the light of Pyeongtaek!"

1:09:55.376 --> 1:10:02.543
"Spread all over the world!"

1:10:04.876 --> 1:10:07.584
The school anthem is really good.

1:10:08.168 --> 1:10:09.334
Of course!

1:10:09.418 --> 1:10:11.959
The best high school
in Greater Pyeongtaek Area.

1:10:12.001 --> 1:10:13.876
- Right.
- Let's drink.

1:10:15.751 --> 1:10:16.851
Cheers.

1:10:21.459 --> 1:10:24.334
He told me he didn't have a girlfriend.

1:10:24.751 --> 1:10:26.668
You really said that? That makes me sad.

1:10:26.918 --> 1:10:28.250
Well, back then...

1:10:28.251 --> 1:10:31.625
But I'd hide a hottie

1:10:31.626 --> 1:10:33.834
like you too.

1:10:36.418 --> 1:10:37.518
Not gonna answer?

1:10:38.959 --> 1:10:40.059
"Carp"

1:10:42.626 --> 1:10:43.459
You should answer.

1:10:43.709 --> 1:10:44.809
It's not important.

1:10:47.626 --> 1:10:50.709
Oh, Dong-pal,

1:10:52.084 --> 1:10:53.751
have you found him yet?

1:10:56.293 --> 1:10:57.393
You know what?

1:10:58.043 --> 1:11:00.293
Body parts were found
in Pyeongtaek Lake today.

1:11:01.001 --> 1:11:02.101
Body parts?

1:11:02.543 --> 1:11:05.293
I thought it could be
him, so I checked it out,

1:11:05.334 --> 1:11:06.434
but it wasn't.

1:11:07.084 --> 1:11:09.376
The body had a woman's figure.

1:11:11.793 --> 1:11:12.959
That's horrible.

1:11:14.168 --> 1:11:16.334
It's a bit weird though.

1:11:18.418 --> 1:11:22.751
There's a shark tattoo,
as if for us to see.

1:11:25.418 --> 1:11:26.876
What's wrong?

1:11:26.959 --> 1:11:28.168
It's nothing.

1:11:31.293 --> 1:11:32.500
A shark tattoo?

1:11:32.501 --> 1:11:34.918
Yeah, you know something?

1:11:36.376 --> 1:11:38.834
I thought I had seen it, maybe I did.

1:11:38.876 --> 1:11:39.976
Yeah?

1:11:40.626 --> 1:11:43.584
I managed to get a pic from a cop friend.

1:11:45.168 --> 1:11:46.268
Wanna see?

1:11:48.126 --> 1:11:49.226
Check it out.

1:12:02.459 --> 1:12:03.559
It's not this one.

1:12:03.668 --> 1:12:05.001
The shark tattoo

1:12:05.168 --> 1:12:06.792
I know has different color and size.

1:12:06.793 --> 1:12:09.959
No more gruesome talks, let's just drink.

1:12:10.751 --> 1:12:11.851
Cheers.

1:12:19.084 --> 1:12:20.184
Eh?

1:12:20.584 --> 1:12:22.376
It's from Seoul.

1:12:22.459 --> 1:12:23.559
Toilet break.

1:12:31.126 --> 1:12:33.543
Hello? Yeah!

1:12:35.001 --> 1:12:38.668
Don't... don't tell me you
actually killed someone!

1:12:38.793 --> 1:12:42.001
Are you nuts?
That tattoo is pretty common.

1:12:42.043 --> 1:12:43.834
Are you sure? Is it really him?

1:12:44.543 --> 1:12:47.709
Should I tell that asshole that
you got the same tattoo?

1:12:53.751 --> 1:12:56.126
Go ahead. Do it.

1:12:57.209 --> 1:12:59.793
Oh man...

1:13:01.418 --> 1:13:03.876
Jeez...

1:13:08.043 --> 1:13:09.143
What's wrong?

1:13:10.584 --> 1:13:12.751
OH Dong-pal got arrested.

1:13:13.001 --> 1:13:13.626
What?

1:13:13.876 --> 1:13:17.668
He was caught in Gunsan
trying to smuggle out.

1:13:18.668 --> 1:13:22.418
In Gunsan?

1:13:22.918 --> 1:13:26.334
I'm screwed,
I gotta go back to Seoul with something.

1:13:27.543 --> 1:13:28.793
That's too bad.

1:13:29.084 --> 1:13:31.834
Worry about tomorrow, tomorrow.

1:13:37.959 --> 1:13:40.750
Drank it all, I'll get some more.

1:13:40.751 --> 1:13:44.209
No, sir! I can go.

1:13:44.751 --> 1:13:46.042
- Yeah?
- Yes.

1:13:46.043 --> 1:13:47.918
- Thank you, bud.
- Sure.

1:13:48.418 --> 1:13:49.918
I'll be right back.

1:13:50.501 --> 1:13:54.001
Where's my wallet... It's right here.

1:13:57.084 --> 1:13:59.084
- I'll be right back.
- Okay, see you.

1:14:05.834 --> 1:14:09.834
OH Dong-pal, you fucking moron...

1:14:13.001 --> 1:14:15.209
That fucking bitch...

1:14:17.459 --> 1:14:18.918
Why don't you ever answer?!

1:14:19.209 --> 1:14:19.918
What is it?

1:14:19.919 --> 1:14:22.001
The cops were here just now.

1:14:22.918 --> 1:14:25.209
I think CHOI Yeon-hee is dead.

1:14:25.334 --> 1:14:27.209
What? Oh my...

1:14:27.251 --> 1:14:29.418
They found a woman's body parts,

1:14:29.626 --> 1:14:31.626
it had a shark tattoo on her thigh.

1:14:31.668 --> 1:14:33.376
Is that so?

1:14:34.168 --> 1:14:35.376
Aren't you surprised?

1:14:36.043 --> 1:14:37.271
I thought you'd be shocked.

1:14:37.376 --> 1:14:41.334
I'm surprised. Surprised to death.

1:14:43.084 --> 1:14:44.501
What do we do now?

1:14:45.459 --> 1:14:47.833
Your debt is due tomorrow.

1:14:47.834 --> 1:14:49.333
CHOI's dead

1:14:49.334 --> 1:14:51.208
and the sucker's our last hope.

1:14:51.209 --> 1:14:52.584
Right, the sucker.

1:14:53.751 --> 1:14:55.333
He was caught in Gunsan.

1:14:55.334 --> 1:14:56.434
Gunsan?

1:14:58.209 --> 1:14:59.459
I knew it.

1:15:00.126 --> 1:15:01.945
Can you come over when I call you later?

1:15:02.293 --> 1:15:04.543
You want me to help you
flee the country now?

1:15:05.001 --> 1:15:06.168
It's nothing like that.

1:15:06.251 --> 1:15:07.209
What is it then?

1:15:07.210 --> 1:15:09.084
Why, wanna spill everything to PARK?

1:15:09.709 --> 1:15:12.751
Come on, I couldn't help it.

1:15:13.251 --> 1:15:14.418
What is it?!

1:15:15.293 --> 1:15:18.918
Yeon-hee is at my place.

1:15:21.001 --> 1:15:21.709
What do you mean?

1:15:21.710 --> 1:15:23.376
I'll fill you in later,

1:15:24.626 --> 1:15:26.833
she's trying to flee,

1:15:26.834 --> 1:15:28.834
I think she has something.

1:15:29.001 --> 1:15:31.417
She wouldn't do anything empty-handed.

1:15:31.418 --> 1:15:32.251
Of course not.

1:15:32.252 --> 1:15:33.542
But the problem is...

1:15:33.543 --> 1:15:36.500
There's a problem?

1:15:36.501 --> 1:15:38.501
The snake's at my place too.

1:15:38.751 --> 1:15:39.851
The cop?

1:15:40.834 --> 1:15:42.208
Having a housewarming party?

1:15:42.209 --> 1:15:43.309
Shut up.

1:15:43.876 --> 1:15:46.208
I'll send the snake away,

1:15:46.209 --> 1:15:47.834
so help me fuck her up.

1:15:49.084 --> 1:15:51.209
I'm not an errand boy...

1:15:51.334 --> 1:15:53.459
We split her money, 60-40.

1:15:54.876 --> 1:15:55.976
Who's the 60?

1:15:56.084 --> 1:15:57.084
You're 40!

1:15:57.168 --> 1:15:57.793
50 50

1:15:57.794 --> 1:16:00.501
Forget it, I'll do it myself.

1:16:00.626 --> 1:16:02.501
Okay, fine, fine!

1:16:03.543 --> 1:16:04.643
Call me.

1:16:08.793 --> 1:16:10.543
Stupid jackass.

1:16:10.709 --> 1:16:12.833
Goddamn prick.

1:16:12.834 --> 1:16:14.543
You better keep your word.

1:16:27.376 --> 1:16:28.959
I'm back!

1:16:39.709 --> 1:16:42.376
Are you just gonna watch? Come help me.

1:16:56.543 --> 1:17:00.834
What did you... What the hell did you do?

1:17:01.584 --> 1:17:04.793
As soon as you left, he touched my leg.

1:17:05.334 --> 1:17:07.626
I was scared that he'd see my tattoo.

1:17:09.834 --> 1:17:11.334
I, uh...

1:17:12.376 --> 1:17:16.001
I'm gonna report you.

1:17:20.293 --> 1:17:24.334
Think before you speak, this is your home.

1:17:24.668 --> 1:17:26.500
Do you think the police will believe you?

1:17:26.501 --> 1:17:29.001
But... why...

1:17:29.668 --> 1:17:31.584
There's still time till morning,

1:17:32.126 --> 1:17:34.459
We can bury the body, and leave together.

1:17:34.584 --> 1:17:36.043
Let's start over.

1:17:38.668 --> 1:17:40.084
Please get rid of him.

1:17:46.876 --> 1:17:48.959
What weak ass.

1:17:57.293 --> 1:17:58.418
Shit...

1:18:04.876 --> 1:18:06.251
Crazy bitch.

1:18:08.543 --> 1:18:10.209
"Pyeongtaek Lake Body Mystery"

1:18:34.209 --> 1:18:35.959
I'm all ready!

1:19:05.459 --> 1:19:06.709
Where.

1:20:00.751 --> 1:20:03.376
Boss. She's awake.

1:20:07.668 --> 1:20:09.251
Long time no see, Yeon-hee.

1:20:11.293 --> 1:20:14.209
You showed up out of nowhere.

1:20:14.543 --> 1:20:16.126
Did you have some fun?

1:20:17.251 --> 1:20:19.376
You even chopped up a cop. so scary.

1:20:20.584 --> 1:20:23.876
Boy, you got a knife too, right?

1:20:24.918 --> 1:20:26.293
Wait, Mr. PARK.

1:20:28.251 --> 1:20:29.626
I'll pay you...

1:20:31.084 --> 1:20:33.251
I have money, I swear.

1:20:33.668 --> 1:20:34.768
Where?

1:20:36.209 --> 1:20:37.334
Where's the money?

1:20:49.293 --> 1:20:50.709
Dammit...

1:20:52.168 --> 1:20:54.918
You lead a tough life.

1:21:00.709 --> 1:21:03.543
Something wrong?

1:21:04.334 --> 1:21:06.126
He took my money.

1:21:07.584 --> 1:21:09.626
You expect me to believe that?

1:21:10.668 --> 1:21:13.459
I won't fall for that again.

1:21:26.543 --> 1:21:27.751
Who the hell?

1:21:31.751 --> 1:21:32.959
Hello?

1:21:33.709 --> 1:21:34.809
It's me.

1:21:34.834 --> 1:21:36.626
Oh hey, are you awake?

1:21:37.626 --> 1:21:39.667
What was it like to get hit in the head?

1:21:39.668 --> 1:21:41.751
Did you see stars?

1:21:43.001 --> 1:21:44.101
Where are you?

1:21:44.543 --> 1:21:47.584
That's none of your business.

1:21:48.418 --> 1:21:51.584
I found your Japanese bank in your trunk.

1:21:56.084 --> 1:21:57.459
Don't touch my money.

1:21:58.168 --> 1:22:00.918
Consider this as my cut for
putting up with your shit.

1:22:01.168 --> 1:22:03.626
Have a great life!

1:22:12.334 --> 1:22:13.793
He'll take the first boat.

1:22:14.376 --> 1:22:16.331
If you search it the port,
you'll find him.

1:22:17.834 --> 1:22:19.668
Son of a bitch...

1:22:22.084 --> 1:22:24.543
If we don't find him before sunrise,

1:22:25.793 --> 1:22:28.293
we'll have a gutting ceremony.

1:23:01.959 --> 1:23:03.059
Welcome.

1:23:03.376 --> 1:23:05.793
Put your shoes in the locker.

1:23:06.709 --> 1:23:07.982
What time are you open till?

1:23:08.084 --> 1:23:09.709
5AM, sir.

1:23:11.084 --> 1:23:12.584
It's not 24 hours?

1:23:12.918 --> 1:23:15.918
We have to close up to get ready to open.

1:23:18.626 --> 1:23:20.042
Is there's a smoking area?

1:23:20.043 --> 1:23:22.793
Yes, it's by the washroom there.

1:23:41.793 --> 1:23:43.001
Damn...

1:23:45.418 --> 1:23:46.751
Do you sell smokes here?

1:23:47.376 --> 1:23:49.751
We don't...

1:23:51.876 --> 1:23:57.293
Could you buy me a pack? Lucky Strike.

1:23:57.834 --> 1:23:58.934
What?

1:23:59.501 --> 1:24:00.918
Please? Just 1 pack.

1:24:01.793 --> 1:24:04.459
Sorry, I'm the only one here,

1:24:04.668 --> 1:24:06.709
I can't do that.

1:24:06.751 --> 1:24:08.709
There's no one here,

1:24:08.834 --> 1:24:09.959
I'll watch the shop.

1:24:11.251 --> 1:24:14.084
I'm sorry, that's the policy.

1:24:15.126 --> 1:24:16.226
I'm sorry.

1:24:17.584 --> 1:24:22.376
Screw policy...
You don't know how to bend the rules?

1:24:24.376 --> 1:24:25.476
Thank you.

1:25:25.334 --> 1:25:26.434
What is it?

1:25:27.084 --> 1:25:29.209
I'll pay it back! I got money.

1:25:29.751 --> 1:25:31.626
Money... I have the money...

1:25:32.459 --> 1:25:33.559
Don't follow me!

1:25:34.293 --> 1:25:35.393
Stay back!

1:25:40.168 --> 1:25:41.268
Buddy!

1:25:42.751 --> 1:25:44.584
You son of a bitch!

1:25:45.668 --> 1:25:47.251
I'll pay it back!

1:26:13.376 --> 1:26:16.334
Holy fuck....

1:26:24.501 --> 1:26:27.459
Fucking Lucky Strike!

1:26:34.376 --> 1:26:36.626
What... about the money?

1:26:40.709 --> 1:26:44.834
"Chapter 6: Money Bag"

1:26:48.418 --> 1:26:50.334
Do you have to go to work like that?

1:26:51.834 --> 1:26:54.459
You got fired, I gotta work.

1:26:57.293 --> 1:26:58.393
Wait...

1:27:01.543 --> 1:27:02.751
You can quit.

1:27:04.126 --> 1:27:05.226
What?

1:27:07.084 --> 1:27:11.418
Why don't we open a shop again?

1:27:11.501 --> 1:27:13.084
What do you mean? You got money?

1:27:14.793 --> 1:27:16.918
Money...

1:27:20.001 --> 1:27:21.101
I think I do.

1:27:23.334 --> 1:27:25.501
Stop saying nonsense and go home.

1:27:26.126 --> 1:27:27.584
Don't leave mother alone.

1:27:45.834 --> 1:27:47.584
"Manager"

1:27:52.751 --> 1:27:53.918
Mr. KIM

1:27:56.959 --> 1:27:58.059
What is it?

1:27:58.293 --> 1:28:01.418
I'm calling about your remaining salary.

1:28:01.543 --> 1:28:03.000
I don't care about that.

1:28:03.001 --> 1:28:05.500
I care, that's why I called.

1:28:05.501 --> 1:28:08.293
Some people use this
to stir trouble later.

1:28:09.876 --> 1:28:12.168
Why don't you come
and take care of it now?

1:28:12.918 --> 1:28:14.668
Remember the cafe on the first floor?

1:28:15.126 --> 1:28:17.001
I'll wait for you there.

1:28:25.459 --> 1:28:27.918
Mr. KIM, over here!

1:28:36.709 --> 1:28:38.418
Come, please.

1:28:44.584 --> 1:28:45.684
Sit down.

1:28:49.751 --> 1:28:50.875
Who...

1:28:50.876 --> 1:28:52.334
Please sit.

1:28:59.959 --> 1:29:02.084
This is KIM Joong-man.

1:29:02.959 --> 1:29:05.917
And he is a detective from Seoul.

1:29:05.918 --> 1:29:07.792
"Detective / YOO Myung-gu"

1:29:07.793 --> 1:29:09.958
And she's the one who lost her bag.

1:29:09.959 --> 1:29:11.584
Have you seen this man?

1:29:19.709 --> 1:29:21.084
I don't really know...

1:29:22.626 --> 1:29:24.959
People come in and out all the time.

1:29:27.293 --> 1:29:29.001
He probably came with this bag.

1:29:31.459 --> 1:29:33.793
That's the bag you took home, right?

1:29:35.668 --> 1:29:36.959
Yeah, I guess so.

1:29:38.209 --> 1:29:40.334
It's the same model as mine.

1:29:41.501 --> 1:29:43.209
I talked to Yoon-ho,

1:29:43.793 --> 1:29:46.501
he said a patron left this in a locker.

1:29:48.126 --> 1:29:49.226
When was that?

1:29:49.459 --> 1:29:51.834
He doesn't remember the exact date.

1:29:52.459 --> 1:29:57.917
He said you wanted to leave
it in the storage.

1:29:57.918 --> 1:29:59.501
It wasn't on the list.

1:30:00.709 --> 1:30:02.959
He's absolutely wrong about that.

1:30:04.043 --> 1:30:05.709
He definitely saw you.

1:30:14.209 --> 1:30:15.418
To be honest,

1:30:16.334 --> 1:30:18.626
it's awkward to say this,

1:30:20.209 --> 1:30:21.918
but I think it's Yoon-ho.

1:30:23.001 --> 1:30:24.101
What?

1:30:24.376 --> 1:30:26.876
Remember the drinks going missing?

1:30:27.668 --> 1:30:29.293
He stole all those.

1:30:30.084 --> 1:30:32.668
He's got sticky fingers.

1:30:33.459 --> 1:30:34.708
I told him several times.

1:30:34.709 --> 1:30:36.918
I've had it!

1:30:38.293 --> 1:30:39.668
You took this bag.

1:30:41.001 --> 1:30:42.959
It really is mine!

1:30:44.876 --> 1:30:47.126
I'm sure of it,
I'm good at catching these.

1:30:47.293 --> 1:30:50.626
I caught you red-handed.

1:30:52.834 --> 1:30:58.584
My wife gave it to me for my birthday.

1:30:59.043 --> 1:31:02.126
I'm serious. It's the truth.

1:31:07.168 --> 1:31:08.918
All right,

1:31:10.751 --> 1:31:13.293
thank you for your cooperation.

1:31:13.418 --> 1:31:15.625
Wait, wait. Are you leaving?

1:31:15.626 --> 1:31:17.334
Aren't you going to check?

1:31:17.668 --> 1:31:21.918
Yeah, well,
if you have more info then call me.

1:31:25.418 --> 1:31:26.543
What the...

1:31:41.459 --> 1:31:43.418
Must I really do this?

1:31:47.584 --> 1:31:49.125
In any case if something goes wrong,

1:31:49.126 --> 1:31:52.209
I'm skinning you alive.

1:32:33.334 --> 1:32:34.834
1 bundle's missing.

1:32:37.251 --> 1:32:38.351
I'm sorry.

1:32:39.459 --> 1:32:41.125
I used it for my kid's tuition.

1:32:41.126 --> 1:32:42.543
Hey, Mr. KIM.

1:32:42.876 --> 1:32:45.918
What's going on here? Did you steal it?

1:32:47.376 --> 1:32:48.476
I'm really sorry.

1:32:49.001 --> 1:32:51.334
Give me your bank info,
and I'll send it to you.

1:32:51.584 --> 1:32:52.709
That's enough.

1:32:55.168 --> 1:32:57.917
I knew it, didn't I tell you?

1:32:57.918 --> 1:33:01.208
I told you that woman
was going to kill us all.

1:33:01.209 --> 1:33:02.333
She sent them, right?

1:33:02.334 --> 1:33:04.250
Of course not, mom!

1:33:04.251 --> 1:33:05.417
Of course it is!

1:33:05.418 --> 1:33:07.458
Then why are these people here?

1:33:07.459 --> 1:33:08.583
He's a detective!

1:33:08.584 --> 1:33:10.708
And she came to find her
bag, get out of here.

1:33:10.709 --> 1:33:12.084
You're a cop?

1:33:12.293 --> 1:33:13.393
Yes.

1:33:13.793 --> 1:33:16.793
Do detectives have tattoos
on their hands nowadays?

1:33:20.168 --> 1:33:22.751
You idiot! He's not a cop!

1:33:27.543 --> 1:33:29.875
Sorry, my mom has dementia.

1:33:29.876 --> 1:33:31.042
Mom, please go outside.

1:33:31.043 --> 1:33:32.500
Where are you going?! Leave that!

1:33:32.501 --> 1:33:34.417
- Stop!
- Don't do that!

1:33:34.418 --> 1:33:36.125
Let go!

1:33:36.126 --> 1:33:37.375
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1:33:37.376 --> 1:33:38.709
Let me go!

1:33:39.584 --> 1:33:40.959
Mom, are you okay?

1:33:41.334 --> 1:33:43.043
How could you...

1:33:48.459 --> 1:33:50.668
Joong-man, hey!

1:33:52.668 --> 1:33:55.543
They're so damn yappy.

1:33:55.584 --> 1:33:57.418
Why did she have to get involved?

1:33:57.459 --> 1:34:02.084
Ow, that stings... What's that?

1:34:12.043 --> 1:34:15.501
You fucking bitch...

1:34:26.918 --> 1:34:28.251
This money is mine.

1:36:11.126 --> 1:36:13.251
Mom! Mom!

1:36:16.376 --> 1:36:19.042
Fire! Fire!

1:36:19.043 --> 1:36:22.876
Mom! Wake up! Mom!

1:37:12.043 --> 1:37:14.626
A grown man shouldn't cry.

1:37:16.418 --> 1:37:20.918
During the Korean War,
the whole country was like this.

1:37:23.001 --> 1:37:27.168
If you're alive, things will work out.

1:37:28.709 --> 1:37:34.043
With 2 arms and 2 legs,
you can start over.

1:37:56.126 --> 1:37:58.459
Go to the boarding gate in 30 minutes.

1:38:18.543 --> 1:38:21.043
Qi-nan, did you miss me?

1:38:21.543 --> 1:38:23.293
Did you really miss me?

1:38:24.251 --> 1:38:26.959
I think you just want to know
what makeup I brought you

1:38:27.043 --> 1:38:28.168
Oh, okay.

1:38:31.001 --> 1:38:32.729
If you want to know what the makeup is

1:38:34.084 --> 1:38:36.876
I'll send you the video

1:38:38.418 --> 1:38:46.668
Here in Korea, they like Sulwhasoo

1:38:46.709 --> 1:38:47.809
I'll give you the money.

1:38:48.584 --> 1:38:49.684
Everything.

1:39:10.293 --> 1:39:13.293
I also bought your kid's toy
and your husband's ginseng

1:39:14.959 --> 1:39:17.687
I bought you so many good things,
what will I get for return?

1:39:18.793 --> 1:39:22.084
Maybe a nice dinner? Okay, deal!

1:39:53.001 --> 1:39:57.293
You ugly piece of...

1:40:28.251 --> 1:40:29.583
