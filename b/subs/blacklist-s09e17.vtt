What was the protocol, Kosta?

01:21.289 --> 01:22.457
Raymond?

01:23.291 --> 01:24.459
How?

01:24.542 --> 01:27.921
The last time I saw you,
you said you were going to meet your fate.

01:28.004 --> 01:31.090
You may very well be about to meet yours.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.383
I don't understand.

01:32.467 --> 01:33.635
Neither do I.

01:34.135 --> 01:35.762
Which is why I'm here.

01:36.262 --> 01:37.388
The plan.

01:37.972 --> 01:42.560
I want to hear from your lips
how the plan was supposed to work.

01:47.607 --> 01:48.691
To begin with?

01:48.775 --> 01:50.276
You were supposed to die.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.113
Elizabeth would be given instructions

01:53.196 --> 01:54.864
on how to make her way here.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.324
I would be waiting.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.535
Elizabeth is dead.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.203
For several years now.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.748
You didn't think something was wrong
when she never showed up?

02:03.832 --> 02:08.086
You never told me how long to wait,
so I kept the lanterns burning.

02:10.296 --> 02:13.383
The noble lighthouse keeper
at the end of the world.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.095
Would be poetic
if you hadn't betrayed my trust.

02:17.178 --> 02:18.805
I would never.

02:19.430 --> 02:21.141
The recordings for Elizabeth.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.143
You saw me put them in the safe.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.060
Yes.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.395
In the screening room.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.355
No one has been in there since.

02:31.192 --> 02:34.529
Then why did I find these
on the other side of the world?

02:34.612 --> 02:36.114
But how?

02:37.115 --> 02:38.408
Bocce balls.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.993

That's your fate.

He and his bocce balls are here
to find out what really happened.

I'm Agent Mojtabai.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.783
I'm Mr. Mojta--

I'm Aram.

03:24.829 --> 03:26.414
How did I forget how to do this?

[Nick] Shocked to see your name
on my phone sheet.

03:29.459 --> 03:32.795
-How have you been?
-Um... I've been better.

03:34.213 --> 03:36.341
I forgot. You actually do honesty.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.843
Last couple months haven't been the best.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.845
Things didn't quite work out
at the Bureau.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.180
I'm sorry to hear it.

03:42.680 --> 03:46.142
The task force I was on got shut down
because of the death of a colleague

03:46.226 --> 03:50.396
and I just couldn't find
my passion in it anymore.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.483
I meant
I'm sorry to hear you say it to me.

03:54.108 --> 03:57.946
You may not remember
but commiseration's not my strong suit.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.030
If we're being honest.

03:59.113 --> 04:03.451
Oh, I remember.
In fact, Nick, that's why I'm here.

04:03.534 --> 04:07.664
Because what I remember
is that you are completely selfish.

04:08.748 --> 04:09.999
And this--

04:11.542 --> 04:12.543
This...

04:13.127 --> 04:14.796
is a million-dollar idea.

04:17.674 --> 04:20.134
Okay. Now I'm interested.

04:20.218 --> 04:23.054
You know how most security systems
are defensive.

04:23.137 --> 04:28.309
They detect a threat and shut it down.
Well, this software is offensive.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.811
When it detects an intrusion,

04:29.894 --> 04:33.856
it activates its own built-in
trojan rootkit to attack the intruder.

04:33.940 --> 04:37.902
Then it throws out colossal floods
of junk traffic to clog them up

04:37.986 --> 04:40.530
while it eviscerates
their operating system.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.574
That is not a million-dollar idea.

04:47.078 --> 04:49.122
It's a billion-dollar one.

04:49.872 --> 04:53.876
This won't just protect people.
It'll actively discourage black hats.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.337
It'll revolutionize tech security.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.548
Right? That is what I was going for.

04:58.631 --> 05:01.843
But I have no idea how to turn
my idea into a business.

05:01.926 --> 05:03.594
Which is why I'm here. Of course...

05:03.678 --> 05:07.640
um, if you're too busy,
or need some time to think it over--

05:07.724 --> 05:11.185

And I've already thought about it. I'm in.

sit right here...

06:13.456 --> 06:15.208
and learn the business.

06:15.291 --> 06:16.209
From you.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.921
I put all of it into these recordings.
Every bit of it.

06:20.004 --> 06:22.090
I knew I wouldn't be there to help,

06:22.173 --> 06:25.134
but I thought perhaps my words could.

06:25.218 --> 06:28.805
That they would provide
whatever might be needed.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.390
And Kosta's job was to wait for her.

06:31.474 --> 06:34.560
And to bring her here when she arrived

06:34.644 --> 06:36.896
so she could open the safe.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.691
The safe is one-of-a-kind.

06:40.775 --> 06:44.487
I had it constructed in Switzerland
to my specifications.

06:44.570 --> 06:48.199
Two thumbprints
in the world could open it.

06:48.282 --> 06:50.660
Mine and/or Elizabeth's.

06:51.285 --> 06:53.121

Yes.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.835

You do know
that's the definition of insanity.

07:22.525 --> 07:26.070
Panabaker gave you a month
to identify who killed Doug Koster

07:26.154 --> 07:28.573
before all those charges
against you are reimposed.

07:28.656 --> 07:30.074
Now, it would be insane

07:30.158 --> 07:33.828
not to do everything we can
to prevent that from happening.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.788
I feel like I'm living in purgatory.

and Agnes are living there with me.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.716
I think you can drop the "sir."

To be honest, I never liked it much.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.094
I prefer "Harold."

07:50.178 --> 07:52.889
Well, Harold,
it's not like Aram to be late.

07:52.972 --> 07:57.643
No, but he had his first meeting
with National Intelligence today.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.062
Maybe he had to run home
after and change his shirt.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.731
Hmm. Or his shorts.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.025
I know we're on the clock
with the investigation,

08:04.108 --> 08:07.570
but if he needs a pep talk
about his new responsibilities,

08:07.653 --> 08:09.155
I think I should give it.

You said he called.

We didn't talk.

along an underground river
in the jungle in Quintana Roo.

El Conejo is Don Márquez?

10:13.946 --> 10:15.406
[Cooper] The Márquez Cartel.

10:15.489 --> 10:16.699
The cocaine traffickers.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.075
Cocaine was their business.

10:18.159 --> 10:21.287
Now they traffic in a different cash crop.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.581
You know what it takes to grow these?

10:25.166 --> 10:27.460
I never used to interest myself
in such things.

I'm still wondering why I'm here.

You know why.

to find it buried in the malware.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.872
Maybe you acted alone.

12:29.039 --> 12:32.710
Maybe you did it for the FBI.
I don't particularly care.

12:32.793 --> 12:35.713
But this has your name all over it.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.090
Impressive stuff.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.343
If I didn't have to kill you,
I'd hire you.

12:43.137 --> 12:44.805
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop, stop!

12:44.889 --> 12:46.098
Please, please! Stop.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.809
Before you do
whatever you're planning to do,

12:48.893 --> 12:49.810
can I please--?

12:50.686 --> 12:52.646
Can I please take a look at that?

12:54.064 --> 12:56.525
You want my computer
after everything you've done?

12:56.609 --> 12:59.111
Sir, I have no idea
where your shipment is.

12:59.195 --> 13:02.198
I do not know what that program is.
But if you give me that laptop,

13:02.281 --> 13:03.240
maybe--

13:03.324 --> 13:05.576
Maybe I can help you figure this out.

13:06.410 --> 13:07.328
So...

13:08.037 --> 13:09.246
Teddy, who did it?

13:09.914 --> 13:13.250
-I don't know, 'cause he doesn't know.
-Go back in there.

13:13.334 --> 13:15.961
-Did I mention my sciatica?
-Teddy.

13:16.045 --> 13:19.798
Like getting poked in the tenderloin
by a narwhal.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.427
Want me to go in?

13:23.511 --> 13:24.512
It won't matter.

13:24.595 --> 13:29.141
If Teddy says Kosta doesn't know
who broke into the safe, he doesn't know.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.352
We'll have to find the answer
some other way.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.146
Maybe you know the answers.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.065
-Me?
-Not you.

13:36.774 --> 13:37.608
You.

13:42.988 --> 13:46.534
[Dembe] The two of you have been arrested
by the NSA seven times...

13:46.617 --> 13:47.785
each?

13:47.868 --> 13:50.287
-Eight for me.
-Shut up.

13:50.371 --> 13:53.207
And Ritchie, you can't even touch
a computer in Norway

13:53.290 --> 13:56.043
without the threat of immediate arrest.

13:56.126 --> 13:57.836
How did you piss off Norway that bad?

13:57.920 --> 14:00.839
-Lawyer. Lawyer. Lawyer.
-Look, geek squad.

14:00.923 --> 14:04.051
We don't care how many gigabytes
you move in your mother's basement.

14:04.134 --> 14:07.513
An FBI agent is missing
and a clock's ticking on his life.

14:09.557 --> 14:10.391
Okay.

14:10.474 --> 14:13.185
Suit yourself.
But you're not gonna like what comes next.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.979
Okay, cop.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.902
Hey, that's all our stuff!

14:21.986 --> 14:25.990
And seeing how it was used
to help build a drug cartel's firewall,

14:26.073 --> 14:27.950
the FBI will be impounding all of it.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.327
-But you can't do that.
-We just did.

14:30.411 --> 14:33.205
Don't worry, though.
You'll get it all back. Eventually.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.460
That was a $5000 8K monitor!

14:38.544 --> 14:41.797
We're real clumsy around here.
Let me get you a receipt.

14:44.258 --> 14:45.926
[Ressler] We can do this all day long.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.595
Now, wanna help us out, fellas?

14:47.678 --> 14:50.389
Maybe we'll give you
this cart of crap back in one piece.

14:50.472 --> 14:51.557
Some of it, anyway.

14:51.640 --> 14:52.641
Okay, okay.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.852
Just don't bust anything else.

14:54.935 --> 14:56.186
What do you need?

14:56.270 --> 14:58.606
[Aram] Bad code is like a bad recipe.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.482
A pinch of this, a dash of that.

15:00.566 --> 15:04.403
To reverse engineer it, though,
you're working without a cookbook.

15:04.486 --> 15:05.696
You're in the States?

15:05.779 --> 15:08.407
-No one told me you were coming.
-Not a good time, Antonio.

15:08.490 --> 15:11.368
[in Spanish] It never is.
For Samuel, yes. Never for me.

15:11.452 --> 15:12.453
We'll talk later.

15:12.536 --> 15:13.996
No, I want to talk about it now.

15:14.079 --> 15:15.831
You're three hours from my university

15:15.915 --> 15:17.666
and you can't even call to tell me.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.210
-[in English] I hear it from my brother--
-I'm here on business.

15:20.294 --> 15:21.837
Samuel works in the business.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.047
You go to college.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.632
There. We talked. Now go.

15:24.715 --> 15:25.841
No.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.010
What happens here,
I don't want you to be a part of it.

15:28.093 --> 15:32.014
What about what I want?
I see you, what, twice a year?

15:32.097 --> 15:33.724
Great. Sic the goons on me.

15:33.807 --> 15:36.727
Drop me a postcard
next time you're around. Or don't.

15:36.810 --> 15:37.811
[in Spanish] I don't care.

15:39.063 --> 15:42.066
[in Spanish] I send him to university,
a future better than this.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.026
Ah, Mr. Marquez?

15:44.526 --> 15:45.611
I found something.

15:46.862 --> 15:49.239
Okay, this here, this building block

15:49.323 --> 15:52.159
is part of a longer code
I wrote for a program called Greylock.

15:52.242 --> 15:56.455
That is why I signed my name to it
like that. As a joke.

15:56.538 --> 15:59.708
-[in English] So this was all you.
-No. No. This--

15:59.792 --> 16:01.919
The rest of this isn't me.

16:02.002 --> 16:03.796
Somebody stole my work.

16:06.340 --> 16:09.426
So this is the Márquez network.

16:09.510 --> 16:13.597
-You get in and out just like that?
-We built a back door. Sue us.

16:13.681 --> 16:14.932
So, what do you wanna know?

16:15.015 --> 16:17.559
Anything that tells us
where Márquez took our agent.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.104
Don't even have to look that hard.

16:20.187 --> 16:22.523
The guy you're missing
is some kind of tech wizard?

16:22.606 --> 16:23.774
How do you know?

16:23.857 --> 16:26.068
There's a user in the network now
poking around.

16:26.151 --> 16:29.279
-It's some serious bandwidth.
-Can you get us a location?

16:29.363 --> 16:32.658
I wrote some of this,
but someone weaponized the rest.

16:32.741 --> 16:34.702
The rootkit I wrote to attack intruders

16:34.785 --> 16:38.914
was used to gut your firewall
and gain access to your shipping lines.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.166
There is somebody out there
who targeted you,

16:41.250 --> 16:43.085
and they used my work to do it.

16:46.046 --> 16:46.880
Wait a minute.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.424
What?

16:49.675 --> 16:51.802
Someone built an apex predator.

16:52.511 --> 16:56.598
You could use it to rob banks, to disrupt
utility services, take down power grids--

16:56.682 --> 16:58.726
Right now, I just want the shipment back.

16:58.809 --> 17:00.436
[cell phone ringing]

17:02.813 --> 17:04.940
Who is this? How did you get this number?

17:05.024 --> 17:07.943
[distorted voice] <i>I have your</i>
<i>missing product. Half a million. Cash.</i>

17:08.027 --> 17:10.863
<i>I'll call in one hour</i>
<i>with delivery instructions.</i>

17:13.032 --> 17:14.158
Get Samuel.

17:14.241 --> 17:16.535
And lock up the agent.
I'll deal with him later.

17:19.246 --> 17:20.330
<i>Hello, Elizabeth.</i>

17:21.457 --> 17:24.001
<i>I hope you're comfortable, sitting down,</i>

17:24.084 --> 17:26.712
<i>with something good to drink.</i>

17:27.379 --> 17:29.923
<i>There's always plenty to eat</i>
<i>in the larder,</i>

17:30.007 --> 17:34.803
<i>so please feel free at any time</i>
<i>to shut me up and help yourself.</i>

17:35.721 --> 17:38.974
<i>If you're watching this, I must be dead.</i>

17:40.642 --> 17:42.978
<i>And the business must be yours.</i>

17:44.313 --> 17:45.773
<i>I'm relieved.</i>

17:45.856 --> 17:47.900
<i>And excited for you.</i>

17:47.983 --> 17:52.821
<i>And worried, as you might expect.</i>

17:53.655 --> 17:55.115
<i>It's strange.</i>

17:55.199 --> 17:56.575
<i>Even with all the...</i>

17:57.785 --> 17:59.870
<i>gunfire and killers in my life,</i>

17:59.953 --> 18:02.623
<i>I've never really worried about myself.</i>

18:03.290 --> 18:05.793
<i>I've been much too busy</i>
<i>worrying about you.</i>

18:05.876 --> 18:08.212
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>What a pain in the ass I've been.</i>

18:10.964 --> 18:11.799
<i>Anyway...</i>

18:12.299 --> 18:13.717
<i>what lies ahead</i>

18:13.801 --> 18:17.846
<i>is a glorious, treacherous...</i>

18:18.347 --> 18:21.934
<i>and, I hope, rewarding journey.</i>

18:22.017 --> 18:23.310
<i>If you'll permit me,</i>

18:23.393 --> 18:25.479
<i>I'd like to share with you...</i>

18:26.647 --> 18:30.234
<i>some things that I've learned</i>
<i>over a lifetime...</i>

18:31.151 --> 18:34.196
<i>of bad deeds and good intentions.</i>

18:34.905 --> 18:35.739
<i>So...</i>

18:36.740 --> 18:41.245
<i>let's take a walk together one last time.</i>

18:51.380 --> 18:53.966
[Nick] Congratulations,
you genius son-of-a--

18:54.049 --> 18:55.134
We did it!

18:55.217 --> 18:58.637
You know what this means? It means
we can start planning to sell this thing.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.222
I still think we should tinker.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.932
There are diagnostics--

19:02.015 --> 19:03.934
Aram, you're killing me.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.853
It's not ready till it's ready.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.688
When? The next epoch?

19:07.771 --> 19:09.565
We have the Vitas Now report.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.316
They gave us a clean bill of health.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.610
We paid a third party
for their assessment,

19:13.694 --> 19:17.239
to find flaws, problems, data gaps,

19:17.322 --> 19:18.907
things we could've missed, right?

19:18.991 --> 19:22.119
-They're only one company.
-Who double-checked everything.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.745
I's are dotted. T's are crossed.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.206
I read it. You read it.
Relax. Time to celebrate.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.792
But they did point out
a few glitches with peripherals.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.878
Oh, please, no jargon.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.172
You know I don't speak circuit board.

19:33.255 --> 19:37.342
They didn't spot anything
that couldn't be patched up easily.

19:37.968 --> 19:40.345
Bottom line, they were happy for us.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.722
And I'm happy for us.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.974
'Cause we're gonna be stinking rich.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.143
You know what we need now?

19:46.768 --> 19:48.937
More champagne and a strip club.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.731
Right. I can't.

19:50.814 --> 19:53.942
I actually have dinner plans
with my parents tonight.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.235
Aram, seriously.

19:56.820 --> 19:57.738
Killing me.

20:00.824 --> 20:03.202
-[man 1] FBI!
-[man 2] Go, go, go!

20:03.285 --> 20:04.161
[gunfire]

20:04.244 --> 20:05.913
-[man 1] FBI. Clear!
-[man 2] Clear!

20:07.080 --> 20:08.624
-[man 3] Target down!
-[man 4] All right.

20:12.085 --> 20:14.254
Hey, bud. How's your morning going?

20:14.338 --> 20:15.505
How'd you find me?

20:16.506 --> 20:19.301
HRT is clearing this place.
No sign of Márquez.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.094
He got a ransom call about avocados.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.180
Apparently, guacamole
is the new angel dust.

20:23.847 --> 20:27.226
We managed to bag this one.
Let's hope he knows something.

20:30.270 --> 20:32.231
[Raymond] <i>There's a lot to the shipping.</i>

20:32.314 --> 20:35.943
<i>But the most crucial part of shipping--</i>

20:36.026 --> 20:40.530
<i>Sun Tzu wrote, "The greatest victory</i>
<i>is that which requires no battle."</i>

20:40.614 --> 20:42.324
<i>I would agree.</i>

20:42.407 --> 20:44.326
<i>If you want to make</i>
<i>your enemy your friend,</i>

20:44.409 --> 20:47.955
<i>create a problem for them,</i>
<i>then solve it. It's that simple.</i>

20:48.580 --> 20:50.249
<i>You'll wanna take notes now.</i>

20:50.332 --> 20:53.335
<i>The following is a list of 12 wines</i>
<i>that pair with everything.</i>

20:53.418 --> 20:58.799
<i>I've said a lot about the mechanics</i>
<i>of how to operate my, uh--</i>

20:59.299 --> 21:00.717
<i>Your empire.</i>

21:02.177 --> 21:07.599
<i>But much more important</i>
<i>than that is managing</i>

21:07.683 --> 21:13.563
<i>the emotional reality</i>
<i>of running this enterprise.</i>

21:14.147 --> 21:17.609
<i>And to do that, you must understand</i>

21:17.693 --> 21:21.571
<i>one concept above all else.</i>

21:21.655 --> 21:27.035
<i>You have thousands of talented people</i>
<i>who work for and with you.</i>

21:27.119 --> 21:30.622
<i>Thousands of people</i>
<i>who you are responsible for.</i>

21:31.248 --> 21:33.041
<i>But at the end of the day...</i>

21:34.459 --> 21:35.294
<i>you're alone.</i>

21:39.298 --> 21:41.133
Nick. Me again.

21:42.092 --> 21:44.803
We need to talk.
You have my number. Thank you.

21:44.886 --> 21:47.931
-You should go to a hospital.
-I got a better idea.

21:48.015 --> 21:51.476
Us figuring out why you were kidnapped
by a bloodthirsty avocado cartel.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.771
Uh, the why is easy. Márquez thinks
I hacked into his system,

21:54.855 --> 21:57.858
accessed his delivery routes,
and stole his product.

21:57.941 --> 21:59.276
But it wasn't me.

21:59.359 --> 22:01.820
But he found your digital signature
in his system.

22:01.903 --> 22:06.658
Yes, which means my Greylock source code
was stolen by our avocado thief.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.952
Who had access to it, beside you?

22:09.036 --> 22:10.704
My former business partner, Nick,

22:10.787 --> 22:12.748
but he doesn't know HTML
from hieroglyphics.

22:12.831 --> 22:17.711
And this third-party risk assessment firm
we hired to spotlight any glitches.

22:17.794 --> 22:21.214
It was early on, but they had
a copy of unlocked source code.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.467
-Can I make a suggestion?
-Of course.

22:24.384 --> 22:26.094
We have two avenues here.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.597
Someone set up Aram, we need to know who.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.807
We also need to track Márquez.

22:30.891 --> 22:33.060
A man like that
is never in the States long.

22:33.143 --> 22:36.521
This may be our one shot
at getting a cartel leader,

22:36.605 --> 22:38.106
so we divide and conquer.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.984
Aram follows up
with the third-party company.

22:41.068 --> 22:44.404
Someone's in charge there.
Bring them in, get to the bottom of this.

22:48.450 --> 22:52.370
The rest should focus on getting whatever
information you can out of our guest.

22:53.622 --> 22:56.083
-What do you think?
-Let's do it.

22:59.628 --> 23:00.879
Thank you for that.

23:00.962 --> 23:02.047
Anytime, boss.

23:04.091 --> 23:06.051
[in Spanish]
Antonio? What are you doing here?

23:06.134 --> 23:09.096
It was a long drive back to Princeton.
I knew the place was empty.

23:09.179 --> 23:11.515
[in English] This is a safehouse,
not a crash pad. Get out.

23:11.598 --> 23:12.933
[in Spanish] Grab the money. Move.

23:13.683 --> 23:14.518
What is it?

23:14.601 --> 23:15.769
[speaking Spanish]

23:15.852 --> 23:18.188
The FBI raided the downtown warehouse.

23:18.271 --> 23:20.524
They grabbed Machado.
They took back their agent.

23:20.607 --> 23:23.360
Agent? That was an agent you had captive?

23:23.443 --> 23:26.113
[in English] Why'd you think
I wanted you out of there? For your good.

23:26.196 --> 23:28.657
-[in Spanish] You're leaving the country?
-No, not yet.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.033
I have something to do.

23:30.117 --> 23:32.786
-[in English] A business matter.
-Isn't it dangerous now? The FBI--

23:32.869 --> 23:36.206
It is dangerous.
That's why you need to let us handle it.

23:38.667 --> 23:42.587
<i>You should never be deceived</i>
<i>into believing that you can...</i>

23:43.922 --> 23:45.757
<i>really trust any one.</i>

23:46.925 --> 23:52.681
<i>My experience is that even</i>
<i>my most intimate partners,</i>

23:52.764 --> 23:58.019
<i>advisors and friends</i>
<i>have had occasion to betray me.</i>

23:58.728 --> 24:01.982
<i>You must always be mentally prepared</i>

24:02.065 --> 24:07.195
<i>to separate yourself from anyone</i>
<i>and anything in your life.</i>

24:08.363 --> 24:10.490
<i>Because people will turn...</i>

24:12.576 --> 24:15.537
<i>You know what I'm talking about.</i>
<i>You witnessed it with Mr. Kaplan.</i>

24:15.620 --> 24:17.289
<i>You've done it yourself.</i>

24:18.498 --> 24:23.712
<i>I'm sorry if I've made it sound</i>
<i>all doom and gloom, lonely.</i>

24:24.296 --> 24:25.213
<i>It's not.</i>

24:26.173 --> 24:28.884
<i>There's a freedom in your new role.</i>

24:28.967 --> 24:31.845
<i>Freedom from convention.</i>

24:31.928 --> 24:34.306
<i>From being a follower.</i>

24:34.848 --> 24:37.559
<i>The pack takes its cue from...</i>

24:38.852 --> 24:40.312
<i>the alpha wolf.</i>

24:40.395 --> 24:44.316
<i>And when that wolf is wise and mindful,</i>

24:44.399 --> 24:46.276
<i>the whole pack prospers.</i>

24:47.485 --> 24:48.612
<i>That said,</i>

24:49.738 --> 24:55.035
<i>you will have one blind spot,</i>
<i>one weakness,</i>

24:55.118 --> 24:57.871
<i>that can't be willed out of you.</i>

24:59.414 --> 25:01.166
<i>And that's Agnes.</i>

25:02.876 --> 25:04.920
<i>I have no advice for you there.</i>

25:05.754 --> 25:07.380
<i>All I can tell you is, uh...</i>

25:08.548 --> 25:13.428
<i>do your best and hold onto that</i>

25:14.179 --> 25:16.514
<i>like it's the last thing in your heart.</i>

25:21.186 --> 25:23.647
My company is highly respected
in the industry.

25:23.730 --> 25:26.066
I don't know what you think happened
with your code.

25:26.149 --> 25:28.360
You turned my software into a weapon.

25:29.027 --> 25:31.363
You took something meant to help
and protect people,

25:31.446 --> 25:33.657
and stripped it for parts
until it was dangerous.

25:33.740 --> 25:36.743
Agent Mojtabai, I've reviewed your file.

25:36.826 --> 25:39.996
Based on what I saw,
nothing you've said surprises me,

25:40.080 --> 25:43.917
except that you blame us
for a problem of your own making.

25:44.626 --> 25:46.378
What are you talking about?

25:46.461 --> 25:50.090
You hired us to do
an independent review of your source code.

25:50.590 --> 25:52.384
Our conclusions were clear.

25:52.467 --> 25:55.095
Perhaps, you've forgotten how clear.

25:56.638 --> 26:00.267
You must not have read our report.
I brought you another copy.

26:03.812 --> 26:06.773
I read it cover to cover.
My business partner, Nick, read it too.

26:06.856 --> 26:09.025
Then you didn't read it thoroughly.

26:09.776 --> 26:10.944
See for yourself.

26:13.321 --> 26:15.365
Aside from a few minor glitches,

26:15.448 --> 26:19.119
you gave us a clean bill of health.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.419
What are these sections?

26:28.336 --> 26:30.130
"Implementations"?

26:31.423 --> 26:32.841
"Vulnerabilities"?

26:36.553 --> 26:38.263
I've never seen any of these.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.518
Damn it, Nick.

26:43.601 --> 26:47.105
See, no one needed to turn
your software into a weapon.

26:47.188 --> 26:49.274
I built a weapon from the start.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.321
What time do Conroy
and the others get here?

26:54.404 --> 26:57.324
3:15. The buyers should
arrive shortly after that.

26:59.075 --> 27:02.203
-You knew this whole time.
-Sorry, you're not supposed to be in here.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.288
It's okay, Chloe.

27:03.371 --> 27:06.916
This is the godfather of Greylock.
The man who invented us.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.336
Everything we've accomplished
is because of him.

27:10.462 --> 27:13.048
What happened to you? Fell off your bike?

27:13.131 --> 27:14.007
Remember this?

27:15.967 --> 27:18.762
I had a little chat
with Walter Sykes from Vitas Now,

27:18.845 --> 27:20.638
and this is their full report

27:20.722 --> 27:23.350
with all those sections
you didn't bother to show me.

27:23.433 --> 27:26.936
The ones that said there's vulnerability
in the Greylock source code.

27:28.563 --> 27:30.940
I don't know if you took
a look around on the way in,

27:31.024 --> 27:32.484
but we're way past source code.

27:32.567 --> 27:35.528
Remember Conroy, all that financing?
That was just the beginning.

27:35.612 --> 27:37.947
We're pitching buyers tomorrow.
Sky's the limit.

27:38.031 --> 27:39.324
You lied to me.

27:40.033 --> 27:42.619
I sat right there,
and you lied to my face.

27:42.702 --> 27:45.121
I omitted. I held a few things back.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.375
What does his company know
that you and I didn't?

27:48.458 --> 27:50.752
If something was wrong,
you would've fixed it.

27:50.835 --> 27:55.632
I was too close to the project. Couldn't
see it. That is why we hired them.

27:55.715 --> 27:58.426
Do you know how dangerous
this could be if the wrong person

27:58.510 --> 28:00.804
with the right know-how
got access to Greylock?

28:00.887 --> 28:03.973
They could strip it down
to its most dangerous parts

28:04.057 --> 28:05.433
and use it to cripple systems.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.978
Systems have flaws. So do people.

28:09.062 --> 28:13.775
I won't destroy this company because
a bad guy might misuse what we've made.

28:13.858 --> 28:17.404
They make baseball bat even though
someone might use it crack somebody--

28:17.487 --> 28:19.197
You can't keep selling this.

28:19.280 --> 28:22.033
I can, as long as clients want to buy it.

28:22.117 --> 28:24.035
There might be a few bad eggs. It happens.

28:24.119 --> 28:27.372
I want this out there so customers
can use it for the good you intended.

28:27.455 --> 28:30.291
No, you want it out there
so you can be rich.

28:32.377 --> 28:35.922
Chloe was right. You shouldn't be in here.
You should leave.

28:36.548 --> 28:39.259
[Park] It's too soon for Márquez
to have gotten out of the country.

28:39.342 --> 28:41.678
Where's he hiding, in the city? Nearby?

28:41.761 --> 28:43.638
I don't know where he is.

28:44.514 --> 28:47.642
-But I know where he's gonna be.
-How would you know that?

28:47.726 --> 28:50.812
I overheard El Conejo
get the second phone call

28:50.895 --> 28:52.522
about his missing shipment.

28:52.605 --> 28:56.192
I know the time and the place
for the exchange.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.945
I'll share it for a trade.

28:59.028 --> 29:00.280
What trade?

29:01.156 --> 29:04.033
I want to be sent back
to Mexico for trial.

29:04.617 --> 29:08.663
Let me guess, you've got a friend
in the <i>Fiscalía General's</i> office?

29:08.747 --> 29:10.665
There's not gonna be
any trial, will there?

29:10.749 --> 29:12.959
You wanna worry
about the little fish like me,

29:13.042 --> 29:16.629
or go after the big fish like Márquez?

29:21.217 --> 29:23.261
You kidnapped an FBI agent?

29:23.344 --> 29:26.431
Threatened him over
a truckload of, what, vegetables?

29:26.514 --> 29:28.141
Avocados are a fruit, <i>imbécil.</i>

29:28.850 --> 29:31.019
You're sick, the both of you.
This whole thing...

29:31.102 --> 29:32.437
[in Spanish] ...is out of control.

29:36.316 --> 29:39.152
Since you were born, I knew you were weak.

29:39.944 --> 29:43.823
You were built to sit behind
a desk or a library.

29:44.407 --> 29:47.619
I saw it, and I let you stay soft,

29:47.702 --> 29:49.412
to keep you safe.

29:50.163 --> 29:53.750
But if you ever question
my judgment or my control again,

29:54.250 --> 29:57.378
so help me, boy, you will learn a lesson

29:57.462 --> 30:00.048
in what a real man of power can do.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.181
Now you wait here until we're long gone.

30:08.765 --> 30:09.974
[in Spanish] You understand me?

30:12.435 --> 30:13.269
Let's go.

30:24.030 --> 30:26.449
[Raymond on video]
<i>There will come a time, Elizabeth,</i>

30:26.533 --> 30:29.369
<i>when you are completely stumped.</i>

30:29.452 --> 30:34.165
<i>A time when you will have</i>
<i>factored in every variable</i>

30:34.249 --> 30:36.334
<i>and you still won't see the answer.</i>

30:36.417 --> 30:38.795
<i>But it will be there somewhere.</i>

30:38.878 --> 30:41.422
<i>The answer is always there.</i>

30:41.506 --> 30:43.675
<i>And when you can't see it,</i>

30:43.758 --> 30:46.678
<i>it's because some assumption</i>
<i>that you've made,</i>

30:46.761 --> 30:50.473
<i>something you've</i>
<i>taken for granted is false.</i>

30:50.557 --> 30:54.477
<i>You think you're in a hospital in France,</i>
<i>it may not be France or a hospital.</i>

30:54.561 --> 30:57.188
<i>It may be New York, in a warehouse.</i>

30:57.939 --> 30:59.774
<i>The magician doesn't trick you.</i>

31:00.358 --> 31:02.402
<i>The magician helps you trick yourself.</i>

31:05.321 --> 31:06.906
[Theodore grunting]

31:12.704 --> 31:13.830
That looks fun.

31:13.913 --> 31:15.748
[Theodore] Cheecha is a godsend.

31:15.832 --> 31:19.836
I'm pain-free and looser
than a kangaroo's tummy.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.424
I think it's a trick, an illusion.

31:25.341 --> 31:26.676
You figured it out.

31:28.052 --> 31:29.178
Oh, yeah.

31:29.262 --> 31:30.597
Oh, baby! [shouts]

31:39.606 --> 31:42.191
If I wanted to know who got into my safe,

31:42.817 --> 31:45.737
I should've been asking
whether this is my safe.

31:47.906 --> 31:52.285
They tore mine out.
You can see exactly where, there.

31:52.368 --> 31:55.246
Then they replaced it
with a perfect replica.

31:55.330 --> 31:58.166
Then they were free to take
the original safe somewhere

31:58.249 --> 32:00.585
and drill for days, if they needed to.

32:01.336 --> 32:03.254
How did Kosta not know?

32:03.922 --> 32:05.423
An afternoon away.

32:05.506 --> 32:07.675
An evening at the opera.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.928
Doesn't matter. That was then.

32:10.011 --> 32:12.639
The now is in Zurich.

32:12.722 --> 32:15.600
And his name is Heinrich Zimmerstahl.

32:52.095 --> 32:53.513
I brought your ransom.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.641
But we know you'll never touch a dollar.

32:56.724 --> 32:58.393
Because you're not leaving.

32:59.310 --> 33:03.231
This place is now your graveyard.
I bury you here.

33:03.314 --> 33:05.858
What are you doing?
We don't have the shipment yet.

33:05.942 --> 33:09.654
Look around. His only way
out of here is through us.

33:09.737 --> 33:11.364
He won't even get that far.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.162
What if I want to get caught?

33:18.871 --> 33:20.039
Antonio?

33:21.416 --> 33:24.168
-What in God's name are you doing?
-Do I still seem weak?

33:24.252 --> 33:26.546
-Like I belong behind a desk?
-You gotta be joking.

33:26.629 --> 33:28.798
How many years of it
do you think I could stand?

33:28.881 --> 33:29.757
Of what?

33:29.841 --> 33:32.301
Of not being allowed to know
about the family business.

33:32.385 --> 33:35.888
Of not getting a phone call when
my own father is just a few hours away.

33:35.972 --> 33:38.641
-You're not strong enough.
-You mean not Samuel enough.

33:38.725 --> 33:40.685
It has nothing to do with Samuel.

33:41.185 --> 33:43.604
I always wanted the best for you. Always!

33:43.688 --> 33:46.399
You wanted me gone.
The college boy in America.

33:46.482 --> 33:47.900
I outsmarted you.

33:47.984 --> 33:49.110
I took your truck.

33:49.193 --> 33:51.696
I ransomed it back right under your nose.

33:51.779 --> 33:54.741
What do you say to that?
Am I strong enough now?

33:54.824 --> 33:56.200
[sirens wailing]

33:59.579 --> 34:01.956
-[agent 1] FBI! Get down!
-[agent 2] FBI! You're under arrest!

34:02.040 --> 34:03.082
You think you're so smart?

34:04.417 --> 34:06.711
You led the FBI right to us.

34:06.794 --> 34:09.005
Me? How about you and your ego?

34:09.088 --> 34:13.009
Kidnapping, calling attention
to yourself, like a fool.

34:13.092 --> 34:15.219
It was you? This whole time?

34:15.845 --> 34:19.098
I did what I had to do.
Look, he's paying attention now.

34:19.182 --> 34:21.934
You want my attention?
You wanna be part of this business?

34:22.018 --> 34:24.228
Okay. How about we de-escalate?

34:24.312 --> 34:26.355
There's a cost to this business.

34:26.439 --> 34:28.691
[Aram] You can talk about it
in family therapy tomorrow.

34:28.775 --> 34:31.235
And this is what happens
when you cross El Conejo.

34:31.319 --> 34:33.071
-Gun!
-[gunshot]

34:33.154 --> 34:34.197
[Park] Hey, drop it!

34:34.280 --> 34:35.656
[Ressler] I got him.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.620
-You're okay. He needs an ambulance.
-And so do you.

34:40.703 --> 34:43.915
I'm fine. But I'm never touching
an avocado again.

34:47.210 --> 34:48.419
[beeps]

34:50.630 --> 34:53.007
I almost died today because of you, kid.

34:56.427 --> 34:57.553
Twice.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.431
I didn't think it would go that far.

35:01.224 --> 35:02.850
I didn't think he would...

35:07.814 --> 35:09.148
How are you involved in this?

35:09.232 --> 35:12.151
That was my code you used
to hack your dad's business.

35:12.235 --> 35:14.654
Really? That's cool.

35:14.737 --> 35:16.030
Cool?

35:16.114 --> 35:18.282
How did you even get ahold of it?

35:19.951 --> 35:23.204
My roommate at Princeton.
He's a Computer Science major.

35:23.955 --> 35:26.457
He saw a beta test version of the--

35:26.541 --> 35:29.460
of your software in his programming class.

35:29.544 --> 35:33.381
He made some minor tweaks,
took the rootkit, made it offensive,

35:33.464 --> 35:37.635
saw how dangerous and adaptable it was,
and said he needed to test it.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.930
I had the perfect target, my father.

35:41.597 --> 35:45.351
Your roommate weaponized
my code in a dorm room?

35:46.102 --> 35:48.104
He said it was the perfect weapon.

35:48.771 --> 35:50.565
You should know. You built it.

35:54.944 --> 35:56.737
[pensive music playing]

35:59.365 --> 36:01.033
I'm sorry, Kosta.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.245
[Kosta] I would never betray you, Raymond.

36:04.871 --> 36:06.080
But I did fail.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.125
You left this house safe with me,

36:09.208 --> 36:12.086
and somehow, I let the enemy slip inside.

36:12.170 --> 36:16.174
I walked by that safe hundreds of times,
and I had no idea.

36:16.257 --> 36:18.593
You wouldn't have. I didn't see it.

36:19.427 --> 36:21.137
It was just a good guess.

36:22.638 --> 36:26.267
When this is over, the house
and everything in it are yours.

36:27.393 --> 36:29.478
Keep it, sell it, I don't care.

36:29.562 --> 36:30.688
It's all yours.

36:37.653 --> 36:40.990
You'll forgive me
if I let you see yourself out.

36:46.579 --> 36:48.080
Mr. Zimmerstahl has arrived.

36:52.627 --> 36:53.836
Raymond.

36:54.879 --> 36:57.089
It's been years.

36:57.173 --> 37:01.636
I was telling your associate here
about the first time we met.

37:01.719 --> 37:04.972
The St. Moritz Snow Polo World Cup 2005.

37:05.056 --> 37:09.685
I haven't gone near a drop of
peppermint schnapps since.

37:10.978 --> 37:11.938
Come with me.

37:13.022 --> 37:15.524
When I came to see you
all those years ago,

37:15.608 --> 37:19.362
I told you I needed
a particularly secure safe.

37:19.904 --> 37:23.532
I told you that safe needed to be
one-of-a-kind. You remember?

37:23.616 --> 37:24.450
I do.

37:24.533 --> 37:26.118
[typing]

37:34.418 --> 37:37.171
You're really going through with it, huh?

37:37.255 --> 37:40.258
I can think of a thousand terrible things
the wrong person could do

37:40.341 --> 37:42.051
if the Greylock code went wide.

37:42.134 --> 37:46.138
But what scares me most
are the things I cannot think of.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.892
I have to stop this
before Nick gets more funding.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.396
You're doing the right thing.

38:00.736 --> 38:01.821
Watch your step.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.449
Oh, dear.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.285
What happened?

38:07.743 --> 38:13.124
Uh, that box was one of the finest
I'd ever constructed.

38:13.207 --> 38:15.751
I couldn't agree more. One of the finest.

38:15.835 --> 38:18.713
The problem? That's not my safe.

38:19.547 --> 38:20.881
My safe is gone,

38:20.965 --> 38:24.468
and the one in its place is identical.

38:24.552 --> 38:29.849
One person is capable of
that kind of craftsmanship.

38:30.474 --> 38:31.350
You.

38:34.895 --> 38:37.189
You built a second safe, didn't you?

38:37.273 --> 38:39.233
Well, of course I did.

38:40.609 --> 38:41.444
Excuse me?

38:41.527 --> 38:43.029
I made a second.

38:43.112 --> 38:44.322
Identical.

38:45.906 --> 38:46.991
For whom?

38:47.074 --> 38:48.784
Raymond,

38:49.285 --> 38:51.245
I made it for you.

39:04.675 --> 39:06.927
Having problems with your source code?

39:07.011 --> 39:10.598
Is this you? Did you do this?
Nothing in Greylock will respond.

39:10.681 --> 39:13.559
And you didn't even start
the space camp program for those kids.

39:13.642 --> 39:14.477
What?

39:15.644 --> 39:17.772
It's over. I went into the servers.

39:17.855 --> 39:20.191
I undid the architecture,
framework, databases.

39:20.274 --> 39:24.278
I have a buyers' presentation.
Conroy's in there, three other angels.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.864
-What am I supposed to tell them?
-The truth.

39:29.158 --> 39:30.242
Uh...

39:31.369 --> 39:33.371
It's not too late. You can fix it.

39:33.454 --> 39:35.831
I could, but I won't.

39:35.915 --> 39:39.251
And it would take
the best IT team in the world months

39:39.335 --> 39:41.087
to undo what I did.

39:43.172 --> 39:44.173
Oh.

39:44.799 --> 39:47.426
Do you have any idea
what's been done with our software?

39:47.510 --> 39:51.806
A couple of idiot kids in a dorm room
used it to hack a drug cartel.

39:51.889 --> 39:55.351
What about the next person who gets it
and knows how to modify the rootkit?

39:55.434 --> 39:58.771
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-And I don't think you ever did.

40:00.856 --> 40:02.775
My code was never safe with you.

40:03.901 --> 40:05.986
You know what you tell them
in the other room?

40:06.070 --> 40:09.615
Tell them your ex-business partner
did what he set out to do.

40:11.450 --> 40:13.411
He tried to make the world safer.

40:21.877 --> 40:23.212
[intercom beeps]

40:23.295 --> 40:24.797
Can you come in a minute?

40:29.802 --> 40:30.803
[knocks]

40:32.012 --> 40:33.639
Reggie Cole is dead.

40:33.722 --> 40:37.143
The trail on the gunman went cold,
but there is one lead left to follow.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.145
The lawyer.

40:40.104 --> 40:41.897
-What was his name?
-Lacroix.

40:41.981 --> 40:45.860
The man must've had associates,
a legal practice, a family.

40:45.943 --> 40:49.655
-Let's find out everything about him.
-Sure. What do we have to lose?

40:49.738 --> 40:52.950
I have everything to lose,
but that won't stop me.

40:53.033 --> 40:55.202
[Zimmerstahl] I'm so sorry, Raymond.

40:55.286 --> 40:58.164
I had no idea you were going to be robbed.

40:58.247 --> 41:00.833
You say you made the duplicate for me?

41:00.916 --> 41:03.961
Well, no. Not you directly.

41:05.087 --> 41:06.839
-Then who?
-A woman.

41:07.465 --> 41:10.968
She came to me
and said she was your representative.

41:11.051 --> 41:12.887
She knew everything about you.

41:12.970 --> 41:15.181
She knew everything about the safe.

41:15.264 --> 41:17.391
She was clear she wanted it made

41:17.475 --> 41:21.395
to the same specifications
as the original.

41:21.479 --> 41:24.648
She paid with the same bank accounts.

41:24.732 --> 41:28.486
The only thing different
was using uncoded,

41:28.569 --> 41:33.741
ready-to-set biometric panels
for the thumb scan.

41:33.824 --> 41:36.076
So anyone could open the new one.

41:36.785 --> 41:40.498
At the time, I assumed
you'd simply set it later.

41:41.415 --> 41:44.543
Tell me everything you can
remember about the woman.

41:45.878 --> 41:47.171
It was so long ago.

41:49.590 --> 41:52.051
<i>I remember glasses.</i>

41:53.344 --> 41:55.304
<i>She wasn't very tall.</i>

41:58.349 --> 42:01.936
-I do remember one other thing.
-Go on.

42:02.019 --> 42:04.355
It happened several times.

42:05.481 --> 42:08.359
-She called me "deary."
-Deary?

42:08.442 --> 42:11.362
And she called herself "mister."

42:12.488 --> 42:13.447
Kaplan?

42:13.989 --> 42:15.699
Yes, Raymond.

42:16.242 --> 42:18.369
Mr. Kaplan.

42:22.623 --> 42:24.250
