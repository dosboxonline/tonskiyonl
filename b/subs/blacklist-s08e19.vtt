[narrator] <i>Previously on </i>The Blacklist:

00:02.794 --> 00:04.963

-[grunts]

00:06.631 --> 00:07.882
Wait. Wait, no.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.177
That good was rewarded...

00:13.513 --> 00:14.889
-[silenced gunshot]
-[Esi groans]

00:18.101 --> 00:20.145
...and evil punished.

00:22.981 --> 00:25.483
I don't believe in that anymore.

00:26.901 --> 00:28.403
Not in this life.

00:28.486 --> 00:32.073
I've opened up a new directive.
Like for Rostova, but double the bounty.

00:32.157 --> 00:34.576
That won't be necessary. I'll be there.

00:35.076 --> 00:35.994
With Keen.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.038
Looking for me?

00:38.121 --> 00:38.955
Drive!

00:40.248 --> 00:41.249
[Aram] Put the gun down.

00:41.332 --> 00:43.543
Not until
I get the answer I'm looking for!

00:45.712 --> 00:48.131
No! He knows where Townsend is!

00:48.214 --> 00:50.759
-[Cooper] We have her in custody.
-[Raymond] Bring her here.

00:50.842 --> 00:53.428
-I'm the only one who can save her.
-Not today.

00:53.511 --> 00:55.847
Elizabeth Keen is a criminal.

00:55.930 --> 00:58.224
She will never be an agent again.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.060
She will never be a civilian.

01:00.143 --> 01:04.397
Her only hope for survival
exists in my world.

[dramatic classical music playing

01:19.746 --> 01:20.914
[door opens]

01:21.790 --> 01:24.709
-[Blake] Mr. Townsend is sleeping.
-Keen is being moved.

01:24.793 --> 01:26.711
-He can't be disturbed.
-I need to see him.

01:26.795 --> 01:29.464
-We have people in position.
-He was very clear.

01:29.547 --> 01:31.549
Keen is in FBI custody.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.301
-So?
-So...

01:34.219 --> 01:37.514
hitting a federal convoy is public.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.432
Messy. I need to see him.

01:39.516 --> 01:42.435
Hey. We work for a madman.

01:42.519 --> 01:46.481
I'm separating the man's medication,
so I know better than anyone, he's insane.

01:46.564 --> 01:49.275
-This is insane.
-Watch your words.

01:49.359 --> 01:52.028
He's feeding off this.
Destroying himself and us.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.739
The FBI raided us.
There are warrants for our arrest.

01:54.823 --> 01:57.033
-You're out of line.
-What is this even about?

01:57.117 --> 01:59.160
Elizabeth Keen has to die.

01:59.244 --> 02:02.914
We should go out, shoot feds,
risk our lives for some lunatic?

02:02.997 --> 02:06.000
What? What did you call Mr. Townsend?

02:06.084 --> 02:07.418
I didn't mean it.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.713
The man is avenging
the death of his wife and children.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.799
We're the only family he has left.

02:12.882 --> 02:16.427
So we will take care of him
the way he takes care of us.

02:16.511 --> 02:19.097
Now, let me do my work.

02:19.722 --> 02:22.976
And don't ever
disparage the good man again.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.448
[pensive music playing]

02:39.367 --> 02:40.285
Where are they?

02:40.368 --> 02:42.579
The decoy convoy
is passing through the 7th Ward.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.414
-Keen and Ressler?
-They held back.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.916
Left just six minutes ago. Thank you.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.920
Best guess is they are... 23 minutes out.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.005
[Cooper] <i>No interference?</i>

02:52.672 --> 02:54.132
[Aram] <i>Uh, nothing yet.</i>

02:54.215 --> 02:57.260
<i>Maybe Townsend isn't crazy enough</i>
<i>to hit an FBI convoy.</i>

02:57.343 --> 02:59.596
-You really believe that?
-I do not.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.223
Just, uh, trying to stay optimistic here.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.728
Why are you doing this?

03:08.438 --> 03:10.815
You know what happens if you take me in.

03:10.899 --> 03:14.277
I know what happens if I don't.
Townsend won't stop.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.195
And I won't bury you, Keen.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.573
I won't stand next to Agnes
crying at your funeral.

03:18.656 --> 03:20.408
You think I'm safer in custody?

03:21.492 --> 03:24.412
Townsend has people everywhere.
He can hit me from the inside.

03:24.495 --> 03:27.206
-I won't last more than a few days.
-We'll see.

03:30.126 --> 03:32.170
Even if you're right, what then?

03:32.253 --> 03:35.256
It's over. I'll never be an agent again.

03:36.090 --> 03:38.009
-I'm going to prison.
-You don't know that.

03:38.092 --> 03:40.303
If Reddington can still walk around,
you can too.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.722
The rules are different for Reddington.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.559
What I've done, I can't undo.

03:47.685 --> 03:51.689
Mary Bremmer's death.
The bomb in Reddington's hospital room.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.942
Everything that happened in Kansas.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.321
You're holding onto a reality
that doesn't exist.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.532
Ressler, you have to accept it.

04:02.450 --> 04:05.203
Things are never going back
to how they were.

04:06.037 --> 04:08.456
[Raymond] I tried to convey this, Harold.

04:08.539 --> 04:12.585
But once again
we find ourselves in a situation where,

04:12.669 --> 04:16.130
when faced with... a unique,

04:16.214 --> 04:20.218
complicated and volatile
set of circumstances,

04:20.301 --> 04:23.638
you immediately punt
to bureaucratic protocol.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.056
Elizabeth's coming in.

04:25.139 --> 04:28.768
I'm not releasing her,
and I'm not turning her over to you.

04:29.310 --> 04:30.937
Things have changed.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.731
From the day I arrived,

04:33.815 --> 04:36.901
my intent has been to keep Elizabeth safe.

04:36.985 --> 04:42.198
To do that, I had to keep
certain facts about my life hidden.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.033
Well, the truth is out.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.202
-Whatever you're hiding, Townsend knows.
-Yes.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.664
And because he knows,
his focus has shifted

04:49.747 --> 04:52.292
away from me and onto Elizabeth.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.459
Why?

04:55.461 --> 04:58.172
To try to make me understand
how he suffered

04:58.256 --> 05:00.341
the day his family was slaughtered.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.635
So he wants to kill Elizabeth
to make you suffer?

05:02.719 --> 05:05.972
Not just suffer, to understand.

05:06.597 --> 05:10.893
<i>He experienced something</i>
<i>too dark to comprehend.</i>

05:10.977 --> 05:14.605
<i>To avenge what was done</i>
<i>to his family and to him...</i>

05:15.523 --> 05:16.816
<i>he wants to...</i>

05:17.358 --> 05:22.613
<i>feel that I've experienced</i>
<i>a similar darkness for myself.</i>

05:23.156 --> 05:24.699
-[classical music ends]
-[gasps]

05:26.409 --> 05:28.453
[breathing heavily]

05:28.536 --> 05:30.079
[Cooper] <i>Why tell me this now?</i>

05:30.163 --> 05:32.081
[Raymond] <i>Because you can't protect her.</i>

05:32.165 --> 05:35.335
And you're about to find out
what you're up against.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.300
Part of it is my fault.
I didn't stop you before you went too far.

05:42.383 --> 05:43.718
-Ressler--
-The calls,

05:43.801 --> 05:46.179
meeting you without telling Cooper...

05:46.262 --> 05:48.431
And that night you showed up
at my apartment...

05:49.265 --> 05:51.517
You weren't wrong for wanting to help.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.019
But I didn't help, Liz.

05:53.102 --> 05:54.062
I only made it worse.

05:54.145 --> 05:57.648
I mean, I let how much I care about you
cloud my judgment.

05:57.732 --> 06:00.985
This wasn't about your judgment.
I knew exactly what I was doing.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.112
[pensive music playing]

06:03.196 --> 06:06.449
Look, if Reddington
wants to keep his secrets...

06:07.992 --> 06:10.536
that's fine. He can keep them all.

06:11.537 --> 06:15.833
Except for the ones that are truths
about my life and my daughter's life.

06:16.834 --> 06:20.171
Except the ones that explain
why psychotics like Townsend

06:20.254 --> 06:23.299
wake up every morning
drooling about new ways

06:23.382 --> 06:27.470
to murder me and my daughter
as payback for something he did.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.515
Those he doesn't get to hide.

06:30.598 --> 06:34.102
I'm telling you now,
I am so tired of the double standard.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.104
-What double standard?
-You know.

06:36.854 --> 06:39.816
Reddington can do whatever he wants,

06:39.899 --> 06:42.652
and the task force
just takes it in stride.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.196
We don't even know who he is.

06:46.280 --> 06:50.660
Except for that he's a Russian spy
who murdered my adoptive father,

06:50.743 --> 06:51.994
my mother,

06:52.078 --> 06:54.122
is responsible
for the deaths of my husband,

06:54.205 --> 06:57.416
-half-sister, grandfather--
-Nobody's okay with that.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.751
You accept it.

07:00.628 --> 07:03.381
Doesn't matter what he does.
It's okay. But me?

07:03.464 --> 07:06.425
I fight back and I've gone too far.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.563
Looks like we just got some backup.

07:21.482 --> 07:22.817
[phone ringing]

07:23.443 --> 07:26.446
Hey, uh, I'm monitoring your progress.
Everything okay?

07:26.529 --> 07:27.530
So far so good.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.283
No sign of Townsend,
and backup just got here.

07:30.366 --> 07:31.451
Backup?

07:32.160 --> 07:34.495
Okay, and what backup would that be?

07:34.579 --> 07:37.331
Local. Two MPD units
just joined the convoy.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.458
<i>Okay. Negative.</i>

07:38.541 --> 07:39.876
<i>I'm checking scanners,</i>

07:39.959 --> 07:42.795
<i>but we specifically chose</i>
<i>not to ask for city reinforcement.</i>

07:42.879 --> 07:44.213
Those aren't cops.

07:45.214 --> 07:46.299
Gun!

07:51.387 --> 07:52.972
Shots fired. Officer down!

07:53.055 --> 07:54.474
Get us out of here!

07:59.479 --> 08:01.230
[horn blaring]

08:16.454 --> 08:19.457
[high-pitched whine]

08:47.401 --> 08:48.694
Where's Keen?

08:51.113 --> 08:52.698
Last chance.

08:53.449 --> 08:54.617
[Liz] Right behind you.

08:57.453 --> 08:58.829
Hey. Ressler, you okay?

08:59.664 --> 09:02.708
-I can't hear what you're saying.
-I can't breathe.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.336
Oh, no. No, no, no.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.380
We gotta go.

09:07.463 --> 09:10.091
We cannot stay.
We gotta go. We gotta move.

09:10.174 --> 09:11.092
Here.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.145
[dramatic music playing]

09:31.696 --> 09:33.698
-Tell me it's done.
-Almost.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.825
Two of our men are dead,
but the convoy's down.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.244
-She's on foot?
<i>-In the Seventh Ward.</i>

09:38.327 --> 09:40.621
-Less than a minute ahead.
<i>-I'm sending more men.</i>

09:40.705 --> 09:43.541
Lock the area down.
Clear every block until you find her.

09:43.624 --> 09:44.875
And then?

09:44.959 --> 09:46.460
<i>If possible, bring her to me.</i>

09:46.544 --> 09:50.881
If not, kill her and anyone else
who stands in your way.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.896
[man on radio] <i>Reports indicating</i>
<i>shots fired. All units, officers down.</i>

10:05.980 --> 10:07.565
<i>All units, officers down.</i>

<i>Witnesses on site</i>
<i>report multiple fatalities.</i>

10:10.151 --> 10:11.527
<i>EMS and SWAT en route.</i>

10:13.738 --> 10:15.489
Excuse me. Convoy's down, sir.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.074
-[Cooper] Down?
-[Aram] Attacked.

10:17.158 --> 10:19.493
By two gunmen posing as Metro PD units.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.329
They're saying three agents down,

10:21.412 --> 10:24.624
two in the support vehicle
and the one driving Liz and Ressler.

10:24.707 --> 10:28.210
-Aram, what about Elizabeth?
-She's unaccounted for.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.253
So is Ressler.

10:29.337 --> 10:32.340
A witness claims she saw a man and a woman
running from the scene.

10:32.423 --> 10:33.716
They're on foot?

10:33.799 --> 10:35.301
<i>Where? What location?</i>

10:35.384 --> 10:38.596
[Aram] <i>The convoy was hit moving southeast</i>
<i>on Central at Wilmont.</i>

10:39.472 --> 10:40.806
That won't be the end of it.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.601
-Townsend will have more teams.
-We'll handle it.

10:43.684 --> 10:46.520
-Area will be swarming with police.
-We're running out of time.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.439
Look your way, I'll look mine.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.567
[Ressler coughing]

10:53.986 --> 10:55.154
I need your badge.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.073
[groaning]

11:00.493 --> 11:03.329
[sirens wailing in distance]

11:20.554 --> 11:23.766
-[Cooper] What about the gunmen?
-Both dead. Found shot at the crash site.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.768
I want you and Park on site.

11:25.851 --> 11:29.355
Coordinate the bureau and Metro response
and find them before Townsend can.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.028
[Liz] Take your coat off.

11:40.449 --> 11:41.450
[Ressler groaning]

11:49.667 --> 11:53.379
[high-pitched whine]

11:57.842 --> 12:00.970
[dramatic music playing]

12:02.638 --> 12:04.807
[grunting, groaning]

12:26.454 --> 12:27.413
[Liz] I got you.

12:29.498 --> 12:31.083
[glass shatters]

12:53.397 --> 12:54.231
[gunshot]

12:54.857 --> 12:55.691
Keen!

12:59.278 --> 13:00.446
We have to keep moving.

13:11.832 --> 13:16.545
Raymond, even if we can avoid
the police and Townsend's men...

13:17.213 --> 13:19.381
Elizabeth won't be easy to find.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.134
I agree. We're not looking for Elizabeth.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.261
-We need to find Bino.
-Bino?

13:24.345 --> 13:27.973
I think his real name
is Balthazar something.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.141
Baker.

13:29.225 --> 13:33.270
Anyway, he came up
as muscle with Moms Wimbley,

13:33.354 --> 13:36.440
back when she went to war
with the Italians in the mid-'70s.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.609
-An enforcer?
-One of the best.

13:38.692 --> 13:41.612
Story was he had more hits than Babe Ruth.

13:41.695 --> 13:44.240
People started calling him Bambino.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.033
After a while, just Bino.

13:46.659 --> 13:50.454
Nowadays, he runs a payday loan operation
in the Seventh Ward.

13:50.538 --> 13:55.584
His people move at least half a million
in cash on those streets every week.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.795
He's got eyes on every corner.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.923
Locals on the payroll who move his money

14:01.006 --> 14:02.675
right under the law's nose.

14:02.758 --> 14:07.429
If Elizabeth and Donald are still alive,
he can find them.

14:07.513 --> 14:11.767
<i>He owns an underground chess club</i>
<i>in the Seventh Ward, The Castle.</i>

14:11.850 --> 14:15.271
Bino's a hell of a player,
way better than me,

14:15.354 --> 14:16.981
maybe even better than you.

14:20.484 --> 14:21.944
[Bino] You're still here?

14:22.027 --> 14:24.613
Rashad, go home.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.073
Take a shower.

14:26.156 --> 14:27.533
Eat a sandwich.

14:29.535 --> 14:30.411
[Raymond] Ah.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.872
The latest victim.

14:32.955 --> 14:36.625
Let me guess, the Greek Gift sacrifice.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.669
First a shootout in the street.

14:38.752 --> 14:41.589
Now you show up? Can't be a coincidence.

14:42.506 --> 14:43.716
I need your help.

14:45.259 --> 14:48.053
They're still in my ward,
you sure about that?

14:48.137 --> 14:50.180
I'm not. I'm hoping.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.601
You could make some calls, Bino.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.936
Let your network know
that these are our friends.

14:56.729 --> 15:01.233
Friends who are hunted by shooters,
not to mention the police and the feds.

15:01.317 --> 15:05.154
-These people are important to me.
-My people are important to me.

15:05.237 --> 15:09.241
They could be killed.
Or worse, arrested and interrogated.

15:27.801 --> 15:28.636
Sit down.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.099
-Call Aram.
-No.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.352
It's not safe, you said it yourself.

15:36.435 --> 15:39.438
Townsend's got eyes and ears everywhere.
We reach out, he'll know.

15:39.521 --> 15:40.898
We have to risk it.

15:41.607 --> 15:46.320
No, no. Keen, you should go.
You won't make it out carrying me around.

15:46.403 --> 15:48.113
I am not leaving you.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.075
You have to tell the police where you are.

15:51.158 --> 15:54.161
I don't care if I get arrested,
as long as you get to a hospital.

15:56.830 --> 15:57.665
Where are we?

16:06.590 --> 16:08.300
[siren wailing]

16:08.384 --> 16:10.761
[line ringing]

16:10.844 --> 16:13.138
It's Ressler. We need help.

16:13.847 --> 16:17.184
I'm with Keen.
We're on foot, but I've been shot.

16:17.267 --> 16:21.021
-Townsend's men are closing in.
-We're at Danton and 56th.

16:22.064 --> 16:23.732
We're at Danton and 56th.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.318
Ressler's having a hard time breathing.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.320
The bullet might have collapsed his lung.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.072
[Raymond] Danton and 56th.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.075
-Reddington?
<i>-Elizabeth. Listen to me.</i>

16:33.158 --> 16:35.619
<i>I have a way for Donald to get help</i>

16:35.703 --> 16:38.122
and to get both of you away from danger.

16:38.205 --> 16:41.041
Decision time, Bino.
Help me and I'll help you.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.794
Don't just focus on the move
in front of you,

16:43.877 --> 16:45.421
look a few moves ahead.

16:46.839 --> 16:50.092
There's a bar on Danton and 59th.
The Outpost.

16:50.175 --> 16:53.804
If they can get there,
help will be waiting.

16:53.887 --> 16:55.097
-Hear that?
-Yeah.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.515
-Who's that?
<i>-A friend.</i>

16:56.598 --> 17:00.352
The Outpost.
You're only three blocks away. Get moving.

17:03.230 --> 17:04.064
Why?

17:04.898 --> 17:09.319
Because, like it or not, he's our
best chance at getting out of here alive.

17:09.403 --> 17:12.656
If you die, I'm gonna kill you.
You know that, right?

17:22.124 --> 17:24.126
[man] Officer down! Officer down!

17:27.379 --> 17:29.339
[suspenseful music playing]

17:32.009 --> 17:34.678
[siren wailing]

17:41.310 --> 17:43.228
There! One block east on Danton.

17:43.312 --> 17:46.065
Circle up to 58th.
Go, go, go, cut them off!

18:03.373 --> 18:04.583
Hello?

18:07.753 --> 18:08.670
Reddington?

18:09.630 --> 18:11.882
[gunfire]

18:17.846 --> 18:21.225
[high-pitched whine]

18:24.228 --> 18:26.146
This way. Quickly.

18:27.815 --> 18:28.649
Quickly!

18:29.691 --> 18:30.776
Watch your heads.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.454
Find them!

18:45.332 --> 18:46.166
[man] Clear.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.752
It's all clear.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.380
They didn't go out the back.
Door's bolted from the inside.

18:51.463 --> 18:52.798
They were here.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.592
So where the hell did they go?

19:00.097 --> 19:02.724
This takes us
under the buildings going east.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.435
-You work for Reddington?
-Honey, I don't know who that is.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.521
You're in the pipeline
courtesy of Mr. Bino.

19:07.604 --> 19:10.107
Whoever you are, you got powerful friends.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.651
[police radio chatter]

19:17.364 --> 19:19.700
Metro's got a dozen officers looking.

19:19.783 --> 19:21.326
So far, no sign of either.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.996
I just checked with Dispatch.
No sightings came in to 911.

19:24.079 --> 19:27.166
Maybe they aren't running.
Maybe they were taken.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.669
Hey! We got a report of gunfire.
Patrol heard the shots.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.838
-Where?
-About eight blocks north on Danton.

19:32.921 --> 19:34.590
A bar called The Outpost.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.763
-They're here. Keep searching.
-We're out of time.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.849
-Someone must have heard the shots.
-[siren wailing]

19:43.932 --> 19:47.352
Sir, if we don't go now,
we're gonna have to fight our way out.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.231
Fine, clear out.

19:58.322 --> 20:01.074
-Take her to the safe house on Bowden.
-I don't have her.

20:01.158 --> 20:04.620
<i>I thought we did,</i>
<i>but it's almost like she disappeared.</i>

20:04.703 --> 20:05.662
Disappeared?

20:05.746 --> 20:08.081
We have to clear this area.
Our location's blown.

20:08.165 --> 20:11.001
Seems I made a mistake
entrusting this to you.

20:11.084 --> 20:13.754
-No. Sir, I can find her.
-Apparently not.

20:19.927 --> 20:22.763
Here you go, darlings. Far as I take you.

20:23.805 --> 20:26.058
-Hey, Walter.
-[Walter] Delores.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.894
Wanna tell me what's going on?

20:28.977 --> 20:32.314
Don't know. Bino said snatch them up,
so I snatched them.

20:32.397 --> 20:34.024
[Walter] All right, in you go.

20:34.107 --> 20:37.402
This is how the pipeline works.
Whatever's traveling is called the baton.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.321
Gets handed from one runner to the next.

20:39.404 --> 20:40.239
We're the baton?

20:40.322 --> 20:42.908
Normally, it's a brick of cash
half the size of Cleveland.

20:42.991 --> 20:45.452
But if Bino says it's you, it's you.

20:45.535 --> 20:47.621
He's hurt.
We need to get him to a hospital.

20:47.704 --> 20:50.207
-Nobody said anything about a hospital.
-He's been shot.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.667
He's having trouble breathing.

20:51.750 --> 20:55.462
We don't know where you're going.
Only the last runner knows.

20:55.545 --> 20:58.632
If you want a hospital,
let the cops get you.

20:58.715 --> 20:59.549
Not an option.

20:59.633 --> 21:03.303
Then get in.
Time's ticking, we got a handoff to make.

21:07.808 --> 21:10.852
-[Cooper on phone] <i>A gunfight?</i>
-Shots fired into and out of the bar.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.480
My guess is Liz and Ressler were inside.

21:13.563 --> 21:15.065
Looks like Townsend's guys got in.

21:15.148 --> 21:17.276
<i>Nobody's here,</i>
<i>so we have to assume they were taken.</i>

21:17.359 --> 21:19.444
-[cell phone ringing]
-Hang on. I've got another call.

21:19.987 --> 21:22.072
It's Reddington. Maybe he knows something.

21:24.199 --> 21:26.576
I'm concerned. We tracked them to a bar,

21:26.660 --> 21:28.412
<i>but we can't be sure they made it out.</i>

21:28.495 --> 21:31.206
Not to worry, Harold.
They are in safe hands.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.332
Thank God.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.669
-How do you know?
<i>-I arranged the pickup.</i>

21:35.752 --> 21:38.338
An associate of mine in the Seventh Ward.

21:38.422 --> 21:41.133
-[Cooper] <i>And he has them?</i>
-[Raymond] <i>I'm told they're in transit.</i>

21:41.216 --> 21:43.010
<i>Donald's hurt, but holding on.</i>

21:43.093 --> 21:45.178
<i>They're not out of the woods yet,</i>

21:45.262 --> 21:47.556
<i>but we have reason to hope.</i>

21:48.307 --> 21:50.267
-Keen. If I don't make it--
-Stop.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.729
Almost everyone I love is gone.

21:54.688 --> 21:58.358
As it is, I'm barely hanging on.
I cannot lose you too.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.652
So now you love me?

22:01.153 --> 22:02.029
[chuckles]

22:02.112 --> 22:04.906
And you waited until we're in the back
of a hearse to tell me?

22:04.990 --> 22:07.909
Maybe you shouldn't speak.
Save your strength.

22:10.412 --> 22:11.580
It's okay, Liz.

22:12.622 --> 22:13.999
I know what you mean.

22:15.625 --> 22:16.460
[groans]

22:21.757 --> 22:23.300
I know how to do the math.

22:23.383 --> 22:26.178
Just saying,
they make calculators for a reason.

22:26.845 --> 22:27.679
Whoa.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.389
Is he handing out money?

22:32.768 --> 22:34.603
Hey, mister. Can I get one?

22:34.686 --> 22:35.812
Depends. You want a job?

22:35.896 --> 22:38.774
-What kind of job?
-That money's a finder's fee.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.275
I'm looking for finders.

22:40.358 --> 22:43.070
If you're any good,
there's a lot more where that came from.

22:43.153 --> 22:46.281
-Who you trying to find?
-Big crash over on Central.

22:46.364 --> 22:49.951
These two took off running.
They're hiding in the Ward.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.370
-You could find them yourself.
-Maybe.

22:52.454 --> 22:55.874
But I know how it goes around here.
People talk, but not to outsiders.

22:55.957 --> 22:59.544
If you wanna find someone,
make arrangements with the locals.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.505
No trouble, just information.

23:01.588 --> 23:04.299
You know where they are, call the number.

23:04.382 --> 23:08.970
Anybody has a problem,
tell them Mr. Townsend said it's okay.

23:10.722 --> 23:13.100
[suspenseful music playing]

23:26.404 --> 23:28.824
Anton. What's up, little man?

23:39.209 --> 23:40.669
[cell phone rings]

23:42.587 --> 23:43.421
Bino.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.215
<i>I'm hoping this is good news.</i>

23:45.298 --> 23:48.301
Neville Townsend,
that's who your people are running from?

23:48.385 --> 23:51.138
-Does it matter?
<i>-You're damn right and you know it.</i>

23:51.221 --> 23:53.765
If you had told me,
I would've never gotten involved.

23:53.849 --> 23:56.601
-Well, that explains my reluctance.
<i>-I don't believe this.</i>

23:56.685 --> 23:59.396
Do you know what Townsend will do to me
when he discovers

23:59.479 --> 24:00.939
that I'm the one who helped you?

24:01.022 --> 24:01.898
<i>Hard to say.</i>

24:01.982 --> 24:04.693
Probably what I would've done
if you hadn't helped.

24:04.776 --> 24:07.320
-This isn't a joke.
<i>-I'm not laughing, Bino.</i>

24:07.404 --> 24:10.866
Townsend doesn't know,
so we have to keep it that way.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.159
I'm out.

24:12.242 --> 24:14.870
-You hear me? I'm out.
<i>-It's too late.</i>

24:14.953 --> 24:16.746
You're in. They're in transit.

24:16.830 --> 24:19.040
Deal's off. I'm turning them over.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.459
-That would be a mistake.
<i>-You should've told me.</i>

24:21.543 --> 24:25.714
Bottom line,
I'm more afraid of him than I am of you.

24:25.797 --> 24:29.634
Don't do this. If you give them
to Townsend, he'll kill them.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.261
Better them than me.

24:37.225 --> 24:39.060
[suspenseful music playing]

24:51.489 --> 24:52.324
We're here.

24:52.824 --> 24:54.784
Head in
and take the staircase on the right.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.704
That leads to a storage room.
Someone will take you from there.

24:57.787 --> 25:00.290
Give me a hand, he needs help getting out.

25:00.957 --> 25:01.875
Ressler.

25:01.958 --> 25:03.335
He's unconscious.

25:03.418 --> 25:05.754
Can you hear me? Open your eyes.

25:05.837 --> 25:07.255
He's still breathing.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.715
-The car keys.
-Hang on.

25:08.798 --> 25:10.800
I do not care
where you were told to take us,

25:10.884 --> 25:13.637
we are going to a hospital now,
understand?

25:15.722 --> 25:17.098
FBI, Walter.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.767
He's a federal agent.

25:18.850 --> 25:22.312
If he dies, your life is finished.
Now, give me the keys.

25:22.395 --> 25:25.398
-We can't go to a hospital.
-He's dying.

25:25.482 --> 25:28.693
The nearest hospital's 30 blocks away.
He doesn't have that time.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.278
-He won't make it.
-I have to try.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.822
There's a place, but it's not a hospital.

25:32.906 --> 25:35.784
<i>There's a doctor, used to be a surgeon</i>
<i>before coming to America.</i>

25:35.867 --> 25:38.828
<i>Bino keeps one on the payroll</i>
<i>in case one of his people gets hurt.</i>

25:39.663 --> 25:41.248
What happened to him?

25:41.331 --> 25:44.042
Are you the surgeon?
This is where you operate?

25:44.125 --> 25:46.378
-Who's this?
-[Walter] You don't wanna know.

25:46.461 --> 25:49.130
Shot in the chest,
probably a collapsed lung.

25:49.214 --> 25:52.259
Stabilize him
until an ambulance gets here.

25:52.342 --> 25:53.927
[woman speaking in Chinese]

25:54.886 --> 25:57.806
-[in English] Get them out of here.
-Please. Save him.

26:01.142 --> 26:02.811
-Give that back.
-Won't let you call.

26:02.894 --> 26:05.313
This place doesn't exist.
No cops or ambulances.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.148
-He can't stay here.
-[Walter] Careful.

26:07.232 --> 26:09.651
You don't wanna insult these good people.

26:11.736 --> 26:15.532
[Raymond] <i>Harold. Sad to say, things have</i>
<i>taken a nasty turn for the worse.</i>

26:15.615 --> 26:19.327
The associate I told you about
has reconsidered our arrangement.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.705
What? I thought they were in transit.

26:21.788 --> 26:25.917
I'm sure they are,
but Bino has changed the delivery address.

26:26.001 --> 26:29.254
He found out that Elizabeth's
being hunted by Townsend,

26:29.337 --> 26:31.589
and he intends
to give Townsend what he wants.

26:31.673 --> 26:34.009
-You never told him?
-Of course not.

26:34.092 --> 26:35.885
I was trying to motivate him.

26:35.969 --> 26:38.305
-So now what?
<i>-Now we rally, Harold.</i>

26:38.388 --> 26:43.351
Now we shock Mr. Bino and the rest of them
with our poise and ingenuity.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.854
-And how do we do that?
<i>-I have no idea.</i>

26:45.937 --> 26:47.939
Well, that's not entirely true.

26:48.023 --> 26:49.566
I have one place to start.

26:49.649 --> 26:52.652
That bar you mentioned,
is it still a crime scene?

26:52.736 --> 26:55.405

40:04.151 --> 40:06.070
[Raymond] Yes. They're all dead.

40:06.153 --> 40:09.448
I tried to tell you
that this is what would happen.

40:09.532 --> 40:11.117
Everything I've been afraid of,

40:11.200 --> 40:14.328
everything I came
into your life to prevent.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.579
It's happening.

40:16.747 --> 40:19.792
Secrets I've been keeping
because to tell them

40:19.875 --> 40:23.295
would mean dangerous people
like Townsend would stop at nothing

40:23.379 --> 40:25.965
to kill you and your daughter.

40:26.048 --> 40:30.511
And now some of those secrets are out,
and they are coming.

40:31.846 --> 40:33.097
I'm sorry.

40:33.973 --> 40:37.685
I've tried so hard for so long

40:37.768 --> 40:41.147
to protect you from all of this.

40:42.523 --> 40:43.607
I've failed.

41:03.961 --> 41:05.212
Raymond, we're out of time.

41:05.296 --> 41:06.881
We have a car nearby.

41:06.964 --> 41:08.966
They're coming, front and back.

41:09.967 --> 41:12.970
That doesn't sound good
under any circumstances.
