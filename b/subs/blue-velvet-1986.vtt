04:54.630 --> 04:56.212
Mr. Beaumont?

04:57.008 --> 04:59.295
Your son Jeffrey's here to see you.

05:00.886 --> 05:02.798
<i>7894.</i>

05:11.188 --> 05:12.724
Hey, Dad.

07:07.763 --> 07:11.382
Um, do you have a Detective Williams
still working here?

07:11.475 --> 07:15.685
Yes, he's up in Room 221.
Right up the stairs, through that door.

07:15.771 --> 07:17.057
Thanks.

07:32.580 --> 07:33.661
Detective Williams?

07:40.087 --> 07:41.248
Yes?

07:41.338 --> 07:43.796
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont.
I live near you.

07:43.883 --> 07:45.749
I believe you know my father,
Tom Beaumont?

07:45.843 --> 07:47.050
Beaumont's Hardware Store?

07:47.136 --> 07:50.675
Sure, I do. I understand he's
in the hospital. How's he doing?

07:50.764 --> 07:53.677
He's okay, I guess. I hope.

07:53.767 --> 07:56.134
They're doing tests.
That's why I'm home from school.

07:56.228 --> 07:58.999
Anyway, I was at the hospital this morning,
and coming home through the field,

07:59.023 --> 08:01.891
behind our neighborhood,
there behind Vista,

08:01.984 --> 08:05.352
I, uh... found an ear.

08:05.446 --> 08:08.280
You did? A human ear?

08:08.365 --> 08:11.073
Yeah. I thought I should bring it to you.

08:11.160 --> 08:13.573
Yeah, that's right.
Let's take a look at it.

08:18.542 --> 08:20.829
Yes, that's a human ear, all right.

08:22.004 --> 08:24.649
Let's take it down to the coroner's office
and see what they make of it.

08:24.673 --> 08:27.507
Then I want you to show me
exactly where you found it.

08:27.593 --> 08:28.879
All right.

08:31.555 --> 08:33.261
We'll check the morgue records,

08:33.349 --> 08:35.716
but I don't recall anything coming in
minus an ear.

08:36.227 --> 08:39.140
The person may very well
still be alive somewhere.

08:39.230 --> 08:41.688
What can you tell about the person
from the ear?

08:41.774 --> 08:45.017
Well, once the tests are done,
quite a lot.

08:45.110 --> 08:48.444
Sex, blood type, whether or not
the ear came off a dead person.

08:49.240 --> 08:53.200
Also, it looks like the ear
was cut off with scissors.

09:23.524 --> 09:26.141
- I'm goin' out for a while.
- Do you want the car?

09:26.235 --> 09:28.648
- No, I'm just gonna walk around.
- All right.

09:28.737 --> 09:31.229
Oh, Jeffrey, you're not going
down by Lincoln, are you?

09:31.323 --> 09:34.407
No, I'm just gonna walk around
the neighborhood. Don't worry.

09:35.953 --> 09:36.953
Okay, honey.

10:50.402 --> 10:53.270
Hello. My name is Jeffrey Beaumont.

10:53.364 --> 10:54.855
Is Detective Williams here?

10:54.948 --> 10:57.531
Oh, yes. Yes, Jeffrey, come on in.

10:57.618 --> 10:59.109
Thanks.

11:04.958 --> 11:08.998
Well, now, Jeffrey, you found
something which is very interesting to us.

11:09.088 --> 11:10.579
Very interesting.

11:10.673 --> 11:12.665
I know you must be curious to know more.

11:13.717 --> 11:17.802
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you
not only not to tell anybody about your find,

11:17.888 --> 11:20.972
but also not to ask more about the case.

11:21.058 --> 11:23.971
One day when it's all sewed up,

11:24.061 --> 11:26.428
I'll let you know all the details.

11:26.522 --> 11:28.639
Right now, though, I can't.

11:28.732 --> 11:30.348
I understand.

11:30.442 --> 11:33.685
I'm just real curious, like you said.

11:33.779 --> 11:36.317
I was the same way myself
when I was your age.

11:37.991 --> 11:40.278
I guess that's what got me
into this business.

11:40.369 --> 11:42.531
Must be great.

11:42.621 --> 11:44.453
It's horrible too.

11:46.041 --> 11:49.079
I'm sorry, Jeffrey.
That's the way it has to be.

11:49.169 --> 11:52.503
Anyway, I know you do understand.

11:52.589 --> 11:53.589
Sure.

11:57.803 --> 11:59.965
- Thanks for the card for my dad.
- Oh, you're welcome.

12:00.055 --> 12:02.968
- It was nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
- You too.

12:07.062 --> 12:08.582
- Say hello to Sandy for me.
- We will.

12:08.647 --> 12:09.647
Okay.

12:10.607 --> 12:12.189
Good night, Jeffrey.

12:12.276 --> 12:13.938
Good night, Detective Williams.

12:26.707 --> 12:28.994
Are you the one that found the ear?

12:47.978 --> 12:49.970
How did you know?

12:54.318 --> 12:56.105
I just know, that's all.

12:57.654 --> 12:59.737
- I remember you from Central.
- Oh, yeah?

13:00.532 --> 13:02.194
- Are you a senior?
- Yup.

13:02.284 --> 13:05.072
- How is Central these days?
- Terrible.

13:05.162 --> 13:07.265
- I don't know. Boring.
- Yeah. What else is new, right?

13:07.289 --> 13:10.077
Really. So what are you doin' now?

13:10.167 --> 13:13.126
Uh, I'm home from school.
My father's in the hospital.

13:13.212 --> 13:15.420
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

13:15.506 --> 13:17.498
So, what do you know about the ear?

13:17.591 --> 13:19.319
Didn't my father tell you
not to talk about it?

13:19.343 --> 13:21.300
Yeah, but you brought it up.

13:21.386 --> 13:25.426
- You know anything?
- I don't know much but bits and pieces.

13:25.516 --> 13:28.384
- I hear things.
- Yeah?

13:28.477 --> 13:30.890
My room is right above
my father's office, so...

13:30.979 --> 13:33.187
Above your father's office?

13:33.273 --> 13:36.562
- So I heard a few things about the ear.
- Uh-huh. And?

13:36.652 --> 13:39.895
Well... there are a couple of cases
I get mixed up on.

13:39.988 --> 13:40.819
Hmm?

13:40.906 --> 13:43.774
But one name that keeps coming up
is this woman singer.

13:43.867 --> 13:47.326
She lives in an apartment building
that is real close to your house.

13:47.412 --> 13:49.825
It's also close to the field
where you found the ear.

13:49.915 --> 13:52.828
It's a strange world, isn't it?

13:53.418 --> 13:54.249
Yeah.

13:54.336 --> 13:56.147
Do you know where this woman's
apartment building is?

13:56.171 --> 13:58.584
Yeah. It's really close by.
That's what's so creepy.

13:58.674 --> 14:00.735
They had her under surveillance
for a couple of months,

14:00.759 --> 14:04.753
'cept I don't know what they found out
'cause she's not my dad's case, so...

14:06.348 --> 14:09.182
I, uh, guess you gotta
get back home pretty soon, huh?

14:09.268 --> 14:11.100
Mmm, not really. Why?

14:11.186 --> 14:13.303
Well, um...

14:13.397 --> 14:15.138
You wanna see the building.

14:15.232 --> 14:16.848
Yeah.

14:16.942 --> 14:18.934
- Come on. I'll show you.
- Okay.

14:21.989 --> 14:24.948
Hey, baby. Hey, babe.

14:27.786 --> 14:29.618
That's her building right there.

14:30.455 --> 14:32.538
She lives on the seventh floor.

14:39.965 --> 14:41.456
Come on.

14:55.939 --> 15:00.104
So... uh, what are you gonna do
now that you're home?

15:00.193 --> 15:02.936
I've gotta help out
at my father's hardware store.

15:03.030 --> 15:05.443
They're giving me my own hours,
which is nice.

15:08.243 --> 15:11.407
I used to know a kid that lived there.

15:11.496 --> 15:13.988
Had the biggest tongue in the world.

15:16.209 --> 15:18.201
What happened to him?

15:19.421 --> 15:21.208
I don't know.

15:21.298 --> 15:24.291
He moved away.
All my old friends are gone.

15:31.183 --> 15:33.345
You know the chicken walk?

15:33.435 --> 15:34.926
What's that?

15:40.192 --> 15:41.933
That's kind of interesting.

16:02.589 --> 16:04.501
- Coffee time.
- Yo!

16:05.175 --> 16:07.792
Hey, Double Ed, where are the overalls?

16:07.886 --> 16:10.799
They're on the bottom shelf, rolled up,

16:10.889 --> 16:12.380
where they've always been.

16:13.350 --> 16:15.262
Hey, Ed, how many fingers?

16:16.478 --> 16:18.265
Four.

16:19.272 --> 16:21.935
I still don't know how you do that.

16:22.025 --> 16:25.609
Now listen. You sure you don't
need me or this rig for a while?

16:25.696 --> 16:29.656
Well, if you wanna spray for bugs,
Jeffrey, it causes us no pain.

16:29.741 --> 16:31.573
Okeydokey, Double Ed.

16:31.660 --> 16:35.279
- Oh, it's so good to have you back.
- Yeah, sure.

16:56.852 --> 16:59.185
You hungry or thirsty, or both?

17:00.397 --> 17:01.854
I don't know.

17:01.940 --> 17:04.272
I'd like to talk to you about something.

17:05.152 --> 17:06.893
Wait just a minute.

17:08.405 --> 17:11.569
Listen. Don't you guys dare
say anything to Mike, all right?

17:11.657 --> 17:14.150
- Sure.
- It's not what you think, okay?

17:14.243 --> 17:17.328
- Promise?
- Whatever you say.

17:20.791 --> 17:22.282
I don't wanna cause any trouble.

17:22.377 --> 17:23.663
I'm here, aren't I?

17:23.753 --> 17:26.087
- Yeah, he is nice-lookin'.
- Yeah.

17:30.969 --> 17:33.177
You ever been to Arlene's?

17:33.263 --> 17:34.424
Of course.

17:48.028 --> 17:50.270
Now, are you gonna tell me why we're here?

17:56.036 --> 17:58.323
There are opportunities in life

17:58.413 --> 18:00.655
for gaining knowledge and experience.

18:01.750 --> 18:04.584
Sometimes it's necessary to take a risk.

18:06.129 --> 18:08.316
Now, I got to thinking,
I'll bet someone could learn a lot

18:08.340 --> 18:10.332
by getting into that woman's apartment.

18:10.425 --> 18:13.042
You know, sneak in, hide, and observe.

18:14.054 --> 18:16.467
- Sneak into her apartment?
- Yeah.

18:17.516 --> 18:19.223
Are you crazy?

18:19.309 --> 18:22.347
Jeffrey, she's possibly involved in murder.

18:22.437 --> 18:25.555
- This is givin' me the creeps.
- Now just settle down.

18:25.649 --> 18:27.641
I have a plan which I think will work.

18:27.734 --> 18:30.772
There's very little for you to do,
but I do need your help.

18:31.613 --> 18:33.730
Don't you even wanna hear the plan?

18:35.242 --> 18:39.156
Well, you can tell me any plan you want,
but it's not going any further than this diner.

18:40.288 --> 18:43.452
Sandy, don't take that attitude.

18:46.962 --> 18:48.419
All right.

18:48.505 --> 18:50.274
The first thing I need
is to get into her apartment

18:50.298 --> 18:52.756
and open a window
that I can crawl into later.

18:52.843 --> 18:54.334
How are you gonna do that?

18:54.427 --> 18:59.092
Right out in the car I happen to have
some old overalls and a bug-spraying rig.

19:00.016 --> 19:02.804
I will go to her apartment.
I will be the pest-control man.

19:02.894 --> 19:04.510
I will spray her apartment.

19:05.188 --> 19:08.352
After a few minutes, you knock on the door,
drawing her attention away from me,

19:08.441 --> 19:11.058
at which time I will then jimmy a window.

19:11.153 --> 19:13.214
And what am I supposed to say
when she comes to the door?

19:13.238 --> 19:16.072
You will be a Jehovah's Witness.

19:16.158 --> 19:18.150
I have some <i>Awake!</i> magazines for you.

19:19.494 --> 19:22.032
I don't need very much time.
Just a few seconds.

19:22.998 --> 19:24.955
What do you think?

19:25.041 --> 19:27.124
I don't know.

19:27.210 --> 19:32.126
I mean, it sounds like a good daydream,
but... actually doing it's too weird.

19:33.842 --> 19:35.333
It's too dangerous.

19:35.427 --> 19:37.965
Sandy, let's just try the first part.

19:42.517 --> 19:45.760
No one will suspect us because
no one would think two people like us

19:45.854 --> 19:48.141
would be crazy enough
to do something like this.

19:50.317 --> 19:52.525
You have a point there.

20:04.122 --> 20:06.865
Give me at least three minutes
from when I'm through the door.

20:06.958 --> 20:10.998
I can stall if it's more, but I need time
to find a good window. All right?

20:12.130 --> 20:13.496
All right.

20:14.216 --> 20:15.707
Let's go.

20:28.605 --> 20:30.096
Here I go.

20:31.441 --> 20:33.353
Wait a minute. What's her name?

20:33.443 --> 20:35.355
Oh, brother, Jeffrey.

20:36.446 --> 20:38.608
Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.

20:40.075 --> 20:42.783
Look on her mailbox for the number,
bright boy.

20:44.955 --> 20:46.662
Thanks.

20:47.582 --> 20:49.448
Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.

20:50.710 --> 20:53.327
Okay. Good luck.

20:54.130 --> 20:55.621
Good luck yourself.

20:57.175 --> 20:59.167
Three minutes. No sooner.

22:47.160 --> 22:49.072
Yes? What is it?

22:49.162 --> 22:51.245
Pest control. I gotta do your apartment.

22:54.626 --> 22:55.992
That stuff stinks.

22:56.086 --> 22:58.703
Well, this is new stuff.
There's no smell.

22:58.797 --> 23:00.288
Good.

23:13.728 --> 23:15.515
Just need to do the kitchen.

23:43.716 --> 23:45.503
Grand Central Station.

23:59.190 --> 24:00.806
It's only the bug man.

24:29.012 --> 24:30.924
- That should do it.
- Yeah?

24:38.062 --> 24:40.054
Are you all right?

24:40.148 --> 24:41.264
Yeah. What happened?

24:41.357 --> 24:44.395
Well, I was just about to go to the door
when that guy did my job for me.

24:44.486 --> 24:47.524
- Was it all right?
- Yes and no. Did you recognize him?

24:47.614 --> 24:49.276
I only saw his back.

24:49.365 --> 24:51.594
It sounded like he went out a door
at the end of the hall.

24:51.618 --> 24:55.032
Yeah. I didn't get a very good look
at him either, but he sure looked at me.

24:55.121 --> 24:57.864
I didn't have time to get a window,
but I found these keys.

24:57.957 --> 24:59.448
It's pretty nifty, huh?

24:59.542 --> 25:01.875
Yeah, if they open the door.

25:01.961 --> 25:02.961
Yeah.

25:20.396 --> 25:22.183
So, what's next?

25:23.608 --> 25:25.190
Are you game for more?

25:25.276 --> 25:28.644
I owe you one since I goofed this one up.

25:28.738 --> 25:32.357
You didn't goof it up.
But... you still owe me one.

25:38.540 --> 25:41.157
I'm gonna try and sneak in tonight.

25:42.835 --> 25:44.872
It's Friday. Do you have a date?

25:45.922 --> 25:49.131
Yeah. I do.

25:54.973 --> 25:57.841
Well, that does that.

26:12.198 --> 26:14.815
You really wanna do this, don't you?

26:14.909 --> 26:17.026
I don't want you to get involved.

26:17.120 --> 26:19.487
I do, but if something went wrong...

26:19.581 --> 26:21.823
Like you said,
they may be involved in murder.

26:28.256 --> 26:30.839
Okay. I'll tell Mike I'm sick.

26:32.635 --> 26:35.469
Just so the record is kept straight,
though,

26:36.347 --> 26:37.804
I love Mike.

26:40.518 --> 26:42.350
What do you want me to do?

26:45.732 --> 26:49.021
Well, first we'll have
a really nice dinner.

26:49.110 --> 26:50.976
Try to find out
where Dorothy Vallens sings.

26:51.070 --> 26:53.938
I already know.
It's the Slow Club on Route 7.

26:54.032 --> 26:56.490
Great. I'll pick you up about 8:00?

26:56.576 --> 26:59.614
Uh, yeah. But don't pick me up.
My dad might think it's strange.

27:00.204 --> 27:03.072
I'll walk over to your house.
I'll be there at eight o'clock. Okay?

27:03.166 --> 27:05.658
Okay. You better get out
before someone sees us.

27:05.752 --> 27:06.913
Okay.

27:15.053 --> 27:16.385
See ya!

27:42.538 --> 27:43.654
Wait.

27:44.624 --> 27:47.082
Here's to an interesting experience, huh?

27:47.168 --> 27:48.875
I'll drink to that.

27:55.134 --> 27:56.625
Man, I like Heineken.

27:56.719 --> 27:58.460
You like Heineken?

27:58.554 --> 28:01.171
Uh, well, I never really
had a Heineken before.

28:01.265 --> 28:03.257
You never had Heineken before?

28:03.351 --> 28:05.593
My dad drinks Bud.

28:05.687 --> 28:07.770
Ah. King of beers.

28:08.940 --> 28:14.356
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Blue Lady, Miss Dorothy Vallens.

30:20.238 --> 30:22.605
'Cause it's crazy.

30:22.698 --> 30:24.860
And dangerous.

30:24.951 --> 30:28.365
- My God, I should have never told you.
- I'll be all right.

30:28.454 --> 30:31.367
I don't think you should stay here though.
I think you should go home.

30:31.457 --> 30:33.244
Can you drive this car?

30:33.334 --> 30:36.793
- Yeah, but I just...
- Well, leave it in front of your house for me, okay?

30:37.880 --> 30:38.880
Okay.

30:39.340 --> 30:42.048
I'll see ya tomorrow,
and I'll tell ya how it went.

30:43.386 --> 30:45.469
I don't wanna see you tomorrow.

30:45.972 --> 30:48.385
- Mike's coming over.
- Yeah. Okay.

30:48.474 --> 30:50.761
Um, can I call you?

30:52.144 --> 30:53.680
Okay. Yeah, call.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.972
- I hope you sneak out okay.
- Yeah.

31:00.945 --> 31:03.153
I'm gonna wait here until she comes.

31:03.239 --> 31:06.277
- Sandy.
- I'm gonna honk four times.

31:06.367 --> 31:10.782
I'll go one, two, three, four,

31:10.872 --> 31:13.455
and then you'll hear it,
and you'll know she's on her way up.

31:13.541 --> 31:15.282
Okay.

31:18.045 --> 31:20.503
I don't know if you're a detective
or a pervert.

31:22.675 --> 31:25.088
Well, that's for me to know
and you to find out.

31:40.610 --> 31:41.646
See ya.

31:42.278 --> 31:43.814
Bye.

34:03.878 --> 34:06.916
Heineken.

34:32.072 --> 34:34.156
I hope you're okay, Jeffrey.

34:54.053 --> 34:56.261
Thank you, Jimmy.
See you tomorrow.

34:56.347 --> 34:57.947
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

35:26.377 --> 35:29.666
Hello? Yes, sir. Frank?

35:30.714 --> 35:32.080
Frank, let me talk to him.

35:32.174 --> 35:34.757
Please, Frank... sir.

35:38.139 --> 35:39.721
I like to sing "Blue Velvet."

35:41.851 --> 35:45.094
Don. Don, it's all right. Don't worry.

35:45.187 --> 35:48.021
Don. Don, can you hear me?

35:48.732 --> 35:50.598
Is little Donny all right?

35:52.403 --> 35:54.395
Is he there with you?

35:56.615 --> 35:58.197
Don?

36:01.120 --> 36:02.952
You mean Meadow Lane?

36:03.956 --> 36:05.788
Frank! Frank, what's the matter with him?

36:08.711 --> 36:11.044
I know. I'll be sweet.

36:13.799 --> 36:15.381
Mommy loves you.

36:17.761 --> 36:19.673
Okay, Frank, sir.

36:59.970 --> 37:00.970
Oh.

38:28.642 --> 38:30.975
Get out of there! Get out!

38:31.061 --> 38:33.769
Put your hands up! On your head! Do it!

38:34.857 --> 38:37.600
Get on your knees! Do it!

38:37.693 --> 38:39.605
What are you doing?

38:39.695 --> 38:42.733
Who are you? What's your name?
What's your name?

38:42.823 --> 38:44.530
- Jeffrey.
- Jeffrey what?

38:45.075 --> 38:46.075
Jeffrey nothing.

38:48.037 --> 38:50.654
Give me your wallet. Give me your wallet!

38:57.755 --> 38:59.212
"Jeffrey Beaumont"?

38:59.298 --> 39:01.711
What are you doing in my apartment,
Jeffrey Beaumont?

39:02.468 --> 39:04.300
I wanted to see you.

39:04.386 --> 39:07.220
Are you kidding? Who sent you here?

39:07.306 --> 39:09.719
- Nobody.
- I've seen you before.

39:10.726 --> 39:13.013
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key.

39:13.103 --> 39:15.265
I didn't mean to do anything
except see you.

39:16.231 --> 39:18.769
What did you see tonight?

39:18.859 --> 39:20.350
Tell me!

39:20.444 --> 39:22.652
I saw you come in.
I saw you talk on the phone.

39:22.738 --> 39:25.651
- And then?
- You got undressed.

39:27.993 --> 39:30.827
Do you sneak in girls' apartments
to see them get undressed?

39:31.872 --> 39:33.659
No, never before this.

39:34.416 --> 39:36.999
Get undressed. I want to see you.

39:37.086 --> 39:38.918
Look, I'm sorry. Just let me leave.

39:39.004 --> 39:41.747
No way! I want to see you! Get undressed!

39:59.900 --> 40:01.311
Stand up.

40:15.833 --> 40:16.914
Come closer.

40:27.052 --> 40:28.509
Closer.

40:37.938 --> 40:39.770
What do you want?

40:42.192 --> 40:43.774
I don't know.

40:56.832 --> 40:59.870
Don't move. Don't look at me.

41:12.681 --> 41:14.513
- Do you like that?
- Yes.

41:17.352 --> 41:19.685
Don't touch me, or I'll kill you!

41:21.607 --> 41:23.098
Do you like talk like that?

41:24.651 --> 41:25.651
No.

41:28.572 --> 41:30.564
Get over there on that couch.

41:36.330 --> 41:37.741
Lie down.

41:56.850 --> 41:59.593
Shut up! Don't say anything.
Go hide in the closet.

41:59.686 --> 42:03.020
Don't say anything, or I'll kill you.
I mean it.

42:34.930 --> 42:37.138
- Hello, baby.
- Shut up!

42:37.224 --> 42:40.058
It's Daddy, you shithead!
Where's my bourbon?

42:43.772 --> 42:46.264
Can't you fuckin' remember anything?

43:00.289 --> 43:02.121
Now it's dark.

43:10.340 --> 43:11.922
Spread your legs.

43:23.395 --> 43:25.011
Wider.

43:27.482 --> 43:29.314
Now show it to me.

43:49.963 --> 43:51.545
Don't you fuckin' look at me.

44:20.994 --> 44:22.280
Mommy.

44:30.587 --> 44:33.705
Mommy! Mommy!

44:34.508 --> 44:36.249
Mommy.

44:36.343 --> 44:37.879
Mommy loves you, Frank.

44:37.969 --> 44:41.303
Baby wants to fuck!

44:41.390 --> 44:44.633
All right, get ready to fuck!

44:44.726 --> 44:47.218
You fucker's fucker! You fucker!

44:49.940 --> 44:52.603
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

44:53.235 --> 44:54.897
Yes.

45:09.209 --> 45:14.295
Baby wants blue velvet.
I love it. I love it. I love it.

45:14.381 --> 45:17.169
Mommy...

45:34.526 --> 45:37.690
Don't you fuckin' look at me!
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

45:42.868 --> 45:46.578
Look at me. Daddy's coming home.

45:49.708 --> 45:51.290
Daddy's comin' home.

45:53.670 --> 45:57.004
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

45:59.342 --> 46:01.334
Daddy's comin' home.

46:09.186 --> 46:13.772
Daddy's coming home! Daddy's coming home!

46:13.857 --> 46:16.725
Daddy's coming home!

46:16.818 --> 46:18.650
Mommy! Mommy!

46:38.006 --> 46:39.918
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

46:41.635 --> 46:43.718
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

47:02.489 --> 47:03.730
Now it's dark.

47:18.880 --> 47:20.371
You stay alive, baby.

47:22.759 --> 47:24.796
Do it for Van Gogh.

47:59.588 --> 48:01.420
Why don't you lie down?

48:02.674 --> 48:04.506
Come on. I'll help you.

48:14.728 --> 48:16.685
I don't like that.

48:16.771 --> 48:19.434
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

48:21.693 --> 48:23.184
Are you all right?

48:26.823 --> 48:28.405
Yeah, I'm all right.

48:31.244 --> 48:33.281
I'm all right.

48:33.371 --> 48:35.033
I'll go then.

48:36.499 --> 48:38.206
Don?

48:38.293 --> 48:40.000
- Oh, Don!
- No.

48:40.086 --> 48:42.999
Oh, Don, hold me. Hold me.

48:43.840 --> 48:47.083
I'm scared. I'm scared.

48:47.844 --> 48:49.130
I'm scared.

48:50.221 --> 48:52.087
It's okay. It's okay.

48:52.182 --> 48:54.799
Don? Don?

48:57.395 --> 48:59.182
Are you back?

49:09.324 --> 49:11.031
Do you like me?

49:15.372 --> 49:17.455
- Do you like me?
- Yes.

49:26.841 --> 49:29.458
Do you like the way I feel?

49:29.552 --> 49:31.043
Yes.

49:38.353 --> 49:40.185
See my breast?

49:43.358 --> 49:45.190
You can feel it.

49:48.571 --> 49:51.985
My nipple... is getting hard.

49:54.035 --> 49:55.947
You can touch it.

50:01.626 --> 50:03.618
You can feel it.

50:05.630 --> 50:07.713
Do you like the way I feel?

50:09.384 --> 50:10.625
Yes.

50:13.513 --> 50:15.129
Feel me.

50:20.228 --> 50:21.139
Hit me.

50:21.229 --> 50:22.229
No.

50:23.481 --> 50:24.813
Dorothy, no. Stop it.

50:24.899 --> 50:26.060
Hit me.

50:26.693 --> 50:28.434
Hit me.

50:28.528 --> 50:30.019
Hit me!

51:08.610 --> 51:09.942
I'm leaving now.

51:11.946 --> 51:13.528
Torned.

51:16.159 --> 51:17.570
Torned.

51:20.371 --> 51:21.953
Help me.

51:46.231 --> 51:48.769
Oh, my God. That hat.

51:51.611 --> 51:53.193
She's married.

51:54.155 --> 51:55.155
"Don."

52:04.666 --> 52:06.407
Help me.

52:49.794 --> 52:51.501
Now it's dark.

52:52.046 --> 52:54.538
Hit me. Hit me.

53:03.558 --> 53:05.390
Man, oh, man.

53:11.691 --> 53:14.104
- Sandy, can you talk?
<i>- Uh-uh. Mike's here.</i>

53:14.194 --> 53:17.278
Oh, he is.
I guess I'll talk to you later then.

53:17.363 --> 53:18.774
<i>Well, how'd it go?</i>

53:18.865 --> 53:21.152
It went okay. I'll tell you about it.

53:21.242 --> 53:22.733
<i>I'll pick you up at 8:00.</i>

53:22.827 --> 53:26.787
New ax, 48721.

53:27.707 --> 53:32.168
22.95.

53:34.505 --> 53:35.916
I'll see you then.

53:36.007 --> 53:37.669
<i>- Okay, great.</i>
- Bye-bye.

53:37.759 --> 53:38.759
<i>Bye.</i>

54:16.756 --> 54:18.338
Well?

54:19.300 --> 54:21.587
Aren't you gonna tell me about it?

54:23.471 --> 54:24.678
Okay.

54:29.978 --> 54:32.095
It's a strange world, Sandy.

54:37.944 --> 54:41.108
Dorothy Vallens is married
to a man named Don.

54:42.490 --> 54:43.981
They have a son.

54:46.119 --> 54:49.578
I think the son and the husband have
been kidnapped by a man named Frank.

54:51.082 --> 54:54.826
Frank has done this
to force Dorothy to do things for him.

54:56.337 --> 54:57.953
I think she wants to die.

55:01.175 --> 55:03.792
I think Frank cut the ear I found
off her husband

55:03.886 --> 55:05.752
as a warning for her to stay alive.

55:08.516 --> 55:10.132
Frank is a...

55:13.104 --> 55:15.096
is a very dangerous man.

55:16.774 --> 55:18.265
My God.

55:20.194 --> 55:24.063
- Should you tell my father?
- No. I can't do that.

55:25.074 --> 55:27.111
I can't prove any of this.

55:27.201 --> 55:31.070
I found out my information illegally.
You could get into a lot of trouble.

55:33.750 --> 55:35.491
You saw a lot in one night.

55:39.464 --> 55:41.205
It is a strange world.

55:48.556 --> 55:50.548
Why are there people like Frank?

55:51.476 --> 55:53.593
Why is there so much trouble
in this world?

55:55.605 --> 55:57.221
I don't know.

56:02.945 --> 56:04.527
I had a dream.

56:08.701 --> 56:11.114
In fact, it was the night I met you.

56:18.461 --> 56:21.954
In the dream, there was our world...

56:23.049 --> 56:26.838
and the world was dark
because there weren't any robins.

56:27.178 --> 56:29.386
And the robins represented love.

56:33.017 --> 56:37.432
And for the longest time,
there was just this darkness.

56:38.606 --> 56:40.438
And all of a sudden,

56:40.525 --> 56:43.814
thousands of robins were set free.

56:43.903 --> 56:48.193
And they flew down
and brought this blinding light of love.

56:50.451 --> 56:53.944
And it seemed like that love

56:54.038 --> 56:57.031
would be the only thing
that would make any difference.

56:59.043 --> 57:00.784
And it did.

57:10.263 --> 57:12.255
So I guess it means...

57:14.016 --> 57:16.508
there is trouble till the robins come.

57:19.313 --> 57:21.145
You're a neat girl.

57:22.316 --> 57:23.397
So are you.

57:24.318 --> 57:26.810
I mean... you're a neat guy.

57:36.539 --> 57:39.407
Uh, I guess we better go.

57:40.751 --> 57:42.663
Yeah. I guess so.

58:09.864 --> 58:12.698
Hi. May I come in?

58:12.783 --> 58:14.149
Yes.

58:16.621 --> 58:18.032
Hurry, though.

58:26.631 --> 58:28.793
Are you all right?

58:28.883 --> 58:30.715
No, I'm not.

58:32.637 --> 58:34.594
Why are you here?

58:34.680 --> 58:37.093
- What do you want?
- I, uh...

58:39.477 --> 58:41.764
I looked for you in my closet tonight.

58:44.941 --> 58:46.898
It's crazy, I know.

58:46.984 --> 58:49.021
I don't know where you come from, but...

58:49.904 --> 58:51.520
I like you.

58:52.907 --> 58:56.366
It's not crazy. I like you too.

59:01.123 --> 59:03.740
I liked being with you last night.

59:04.627 --> 59:06.118
Same here.

59:11.050 --> 59:14.589
Please be with me. Be with me, please.

Oh, great.

01:02:53.022 --> 01:02:54.638
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.

01:02:55.816 --> 01:02:59.184
- What am I gonna do now?
- You wanna go talk to him?

01:02:59.278 --> 01:03:03.397
Yeah, but...
I don't think it's gonna do much good.

01:03:03.491 --> 01:03:06.279
- Let's just go. I'll try to talk to him later.
- Okay.

01:03:06.368 --> 01:03:09.736
One!

01:03:15.628 --> 01:03:17.620
See that clock on the wall?

01:03:19.757 --> 01:03:21.498
Yeah.

01:03:21.592 --> 01:03:25.302
Five minutes from now, you're not
gonna believe what I've told you.

01:03:30.226 --> 01:03:31.717
Number one:

01:03:33.062 --> 01:03:35.975
<i>Today I staked out Frank's place
with a camera.</i>

01:03:37.274 --> 01:03:39.982
<i>Now, there's another man
involved in all this.</i>

01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:42.026
<i>I call him the Yellow Man.</i>

01:03:43.489 --> 01:03:46.106
<i>You saw his back the other day
at Dorothy's apartment.</i>

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:51.992
<i>Today I saw the Yellow Man go into
Frank's building, laughing with Frank.</i>

01:03:52.790 --> 01:03:54.998
Now, the only trouble is,
what does that prove?

01:03:56.001 --> 01:03:59.870
Nothing, really, but it's interesting.

01:04:02.132 --> 01:04:03.839
Number two:

01:04:04.635 --> 01:04:08.254
I saw the Yellow Man come out
and meet up with a well-dressed man

01:04:08.347 --> 01:04:10.179
carrying an alligator briefcase.

01:04:24.989 --> 01:04:26.709
They went to this factory building
downtown,

01:04:26.782 --> 01:04:28.990
stood on a staircase
and looked off in the distance.

01:04:33.622 --> 01:04:37.957
Now get this.
In the distance, there was a murder.

01:04:38.961 --> 01:04:41.704
<i>This drug dealer was shot to death
and a woman had her legs broken.</i>

01:04:41.797 --> 01:04:44.289
<i>Jeffrey.</i>

01:04:47.845 --> 01:04:51.304
Then these two guys told me that the police
would find a huge amount of drugs

01:04:51.390 --> 01:04:52.926
in the dead dealer's place.

01:04:53.893 --> 01:04:55.885
I can't believe what you're finding out.

01:04:58.105 --> 01:04:59.971
Are you gonna continue with this?

01:05:02.026 --> 01:05:03.233
Yeah.

01:05:04.278 --> 01:05:07.146
Until when? I mean,
what are you gonna do with this stuff?

01:05:07.239 --> 01:05:09.026
Well, I don't know.

01:05:11.577 --> 01:05:13.910
You're not going back to her apartment?

01:05:14.872 --> 01:05:16.829
Yeah.

01:05:18.375 --> 01:05:19.991
Jeffrey, why?

01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:26.419
I'm seeing something
that was always hidden.

01:05:28.302 --> 01:05:32.091
I'm involved in a mystery.
I'm in the middle of a mystery.

01:05:32.181 --> 01:05:34.343
And it's all secret.

01:05:35.935 --> 01:05:37.676
You like mysteries that much?

01:05:38.646 --> 01:05:39.807
Yeah.

01:05:43.275 --> 01:05:44.891
You're a mystery.

01:05:46.278 --> 01:05:50.318
I like you... very much.

01:06:00.584 --> 01:06:02.075
Oh, yeah?

01:06:10.803 --> 01:06:13.716
Jeffrey. Don't, please.

01:06:22.231 --> 01:06:24.348
You worry about me, really?

01:06:24.984 --> 01:06:26.691
Yeah.

01:06:26.777 --> 01:06:28.689
Is that so surprising?

01:06:29.822 --> 01:06:32.030
Yeah, I worry... a lot.

01:06:34.827 --> 01:06:36.819
I got you into this.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.723
What do you want?

01:08:26.814 --> 01:08:29.022
I want you to hurt me.

01:08:29.108 --> 01:08:32.727
No. I don't want to hurt you.
I told you, I want to help you.

01:08:33.862 --> 01:08:36.569
Dorothy, I know some of what's happening.

01:08:36.657 --> 01:08:39.319
Frank has your husband and son,
doesn't he?

01:08:40.828 --> 01:08:43.444
Dorothy, you gotta do something...
go to the police or...

01:08:45.666 --> 01:08:46.952
No police.

01:08:48.042 --> 01:08:49.658
No police.

01:08:49.752 --> 01:08:51.585
Don! Hit me!

01:08:51.671 --> 01:08:53.082
No! No!

01:08:53.173 --> 01:08:55.165
Get away! Get away from my bed!

01:08:55.259 --> 01:08:56.466
Get away!

01:09:24.787 --> 01:09:26.779
I have your disease in me now.

01:09:52.357 --> 01:09:54.349
He used to make me laugh.

01:09:56.111 --> 01:09:58.103
I'm sorry, Dorothy.

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:01.856
I should go.

01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:03.361
Yes.

01:10:09.708 --> 01:10:11.870
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

01:10:12.878 --> 01:10:14.995
I want you to stay.

01:10:15.088 --> 01:10:16.420
Don't hate me.

01:10:16.506 --> 01:10:19.123
Oh, I sure don't hate you.

01:10:19.218 --> 01:10:20.880
I'm not crazy.

01:10:21.887 --> 01:10:24.300
I know the difference
between right and wrong.

01:10:25.724 --> 01:10:27.340
That's good.

01:10:29.394 --> 01:10:31.351
You're my special friend.

01:10:35.192 --> 01:10:37.275
I still have you inside of me.

01:10:38.737 --> 01:10:40.353
It helps me.

01:10:41.490 --> 01:10:43.026
I need you.

01:10:45.077 --> 01:10:47.740
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

01:10:49.331 --> 01:10:51.493
- Soon?
- Mmm.

01:10:54.002 --> 01:10:55.994
- Are you lying to me?
- No.

01:10:57.256 --> 01:10:58.667
- Are you sure?
- Hey!

01:11:02.094 --> 01:11:03.676
Hello, baby.

01:11:05.305 --> 01:11:06.716
Who is this fuck?

01:11:07.599 --> 01:11:10.216
A friend. He's from the neighborhood.

01:11:11.687 --> 01:11:13.804
We were just talking.

01:11:13.897 --> 01:11:15.513
Oh.

01:11:16.525 --> 01:11:18.232
You're from the neighborhood.

01:11:19.278 --> 01:11:20.814
Yeah.

01:11:20.904 --> 01:11:22.520
You're a neighbor.

01:11:24.366 --> 01:11:26.824
Well, what's your name, neighbor?

01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:28.526
Jeffrey.

01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:30.612
He's a good kid, Frank.

01:11:31.707 --> 01:11:33.573
Shut the fuck up!

01:11:37.087 --> 01:11:39.579
Hey, you wanna go for a ride?

01:11:39.673 --> 01:11:41.539
No, thanks.

01:11:41.633 --> 01:11:44.501
"No, thanks"? Wh-What does that mean?

01:11:44.594 --> 01:11:46.961
- I don't want to go.
- Go where?

01:11:47.055 --> 01:11:51.516
- For a ride.
- A ride. Hell, that's a good idea.

01:11:51.601 --> 01:11:53.308
Okay. Let's go.

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:59.729
Hey. Let's go. Get your fuckin' robe!

01:11:59.818 --> 01:12:01.229
Raymond?

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.482
Come on. We're gonna go for a joyride.

01:12:03.572 --> 01:12:05.234
Joyride.

01:12:18.211 --> 01:12:20.077
All right, where do you want to go?

01:12:21.923 --> 01:12:25.132
Oh, I know. We got to go to Ben's, right?

01:12:25.218 --> 01:12:27.050
Oh, right. We've got to see Ben.

01:12:28.555 --> 01:12:30.672
Yeah, we got to, got to, got to, got to.

01:12:30.766 --> 01:12:32.678
We may all be killed.

01:12:36.104 --> 01:12:38.687
He's a pussy, Frank. He's a pussy.

01:12:38.774 --> 01:12:41.608
Yeah, but he's our pussy. Right, Tits?

01:12:41.693 --> 01:12:43.901
Pussy heaven.

01:12:43.987 --> 01:12:47.071
- You ever been to pussy heaven?
- No.

01:12:47.157 --> 01:12:50.946
- Wh-What'd he say?
- No. No. Hasn't been to pussy heaven.

01:12:53.872 --> 01:12:56.706
Ooh! Po-lice call. Po-lice call.

01:12:56.792 --> 01:12:58.749
Bury that fuck!

01:13:00.587 --> 01:13:03.876
This... is... it.

your father, but you might get into trouble.

01:28:55.374 --> 01:28:58.833
Look, forget me. You've got to tell him.

01:28:59.295 --> 01:29:01.537
Okay.

01:29:01.630 --> 01:29:03.166
I promise I won't mention you.

01:29:03.716 --> 01:29:07.460
Jeffrey, I mean it. It doesn't matter.

01:29:08.137 --> 01:29:10.470
Good. I'll see you Friday, if not before.

01:29:10.556 --> 01:29:11.763
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Good.

01:29:11.849 --> 01:29:13.556
- Bye-bye, Sandy.
<i>- Bye.</i>

01:29:30.701 --> 01:29:32.363
- I don't want to talk about it.
- But...

01:29:32.453 --> 01:29:34.991
Everything is okay now.

01:29:35.081 --> 01:29:36.868
I just don't want to talk about it.

01:29:36.957 --> 01:29:40.075
But sometimes
it's good to talk things over, Jeffrey.

01:29:40.169 --> 01:29:42.206
For instance,
they say that many marriages...

01:29:42.296 --> 01:29:44.504
Aunt Barbara...

01:29:44.590 --> 01:29:46.422
I love you, but you're gonna get it.

01:30:18.332 --> 01:30:19.948
Gordon.

01:30:20.042 --> 01:30:24.127
Gordon went right up to 'em in broad daylight,
of course, 'cause he's the man, right?

01:30:24.213 --> 01:30:28.423
And he took all those drugs away,
and it was beautiful.

01:31:01.876 --> 01:31:03.492
I got it.

01:31:06.130 --> 01:31:08.622
- Jeffrey. Come on in.
- Jeffrey?

01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:12.626
Hi, Sandy.

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:13.927
Hi, Jeffrey.

01:31:14.013 --> 01:31:16.050
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I need to talk to you.

01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:19.349
Okay. Looks like you had a bad face-lift.

01:31:19.435 --> 01:31:22.098
- Yeah.
- Come on into my study.

01:31:27.359 --> 01:31:30.602
I have to show you some photos
and tell you some things about them.

01:31:34.992 --> 01:31:36.949
This is the first picture.

01:31:38.621 --> 01:31:39.907
It's Frank Booth.

01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:44.578
He is a very sick and dangerous man.

01:31:45.503 --> 01:31:47.745
His address is on the back of the photo.

01:31:49.715 --> 01:31:53.459
This photo is of Frank and another man
as they went into Frank's building.

01:32:11.946 --> 01:32:16.111
And then that man came out
and met with a third man.

01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:18.692
This well-dressed guy. Here's that photo.

01:32:23.916 --> 01:32:27.034
I think a woman named Dorothy Vallens
is in trouble with these people.

01:32:28.462 --> 01:32:30.875
I think Frank kidnapped
her husband and son.

01:32:30.965 --> 01:32:32.547
I have no hard proof of any of this.

01:32:35.844 --> 01:32:38.678
- Is Sandy part of this?
- Oh, no. No.

01:32:42.351 --> 01:32:44.559
Who else knows you have these photos?

01:32:44.645 --> 01:32:46.887
Just you and the photo lab.

01:32:48.274 --> 01:32:51.563
- And you're through with this business now?
- Yes, sir, I am.

01:32:55.322 --> 01:32:57.609
For now, all right, you better be.

01:32:57.700 --> 01:33:00.192
And Sandy better not be
involved with this, I can tell you.

01:33:05.624 --> 01:33:08.241
Be prepared to come in
for further interrogation on this later.

01:33:09.878 --> 01:33:11.039
Yes, sir.

01:33:20.639 --> 01:33:22.005
Is everything okay?

01:33:22.099 --> 01:33:24.842
Yeah. Is Friday still on?

01:33:25.561 --> 01:33:27.553
- You didn't tell him about me?
- No.

01:33:29.273 --> 01:33:32.391
Why did I ever get you going on this,
Jeffrey?

01:33:35.863 --> 01:33:39.698
- Of course Friday's still on.
- Great. See you then.

01:33:41.076 --> 01:33:43.318
Good night, Detective Williams.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.663
- Night, Sandy.
- Good night, Jeffrey.

01:34:00.095 --> 01:34:02.428
Dad?

01:34:02.514 --> 01:34:03.971
What's wrong?

01:34:05.142 --> 01:34:07.555
There'd better be nothing wrong.

01:35:05.035 --> 01:35:07.072
Looks like it's straight.

01:35:07.162 --> 01:35:09.870
- Okay. I'll get it.
- Okay, thanks.

01:35:13.919 --> 01:35:16.231
- Good evening, Jeffrey. Come on in.
- Thanks, Mrs. Williams.

01:35:16.255 --> 01:35:18.042
- She's all ready.
- Okay.

01:35:20.134 --> 01:35:21.921
You look great.

01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:23.501
Thanks.

01:35:24.054 --> 01:35:26.762
- Hello, Detective Williams.
- Hello, Jeffrey.

01:35:26.849 --> 01:35:28.431
- You all set?
- Almost.

01:35:29.226 --> 01:35:30.433
Hey, John, get a move on.

01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:38.520
Just a minute, Tom.

01:35:40.821 --> 01:35:42.813
Easy does it, Jeffrey.

01:35:44.533 --> 01:35:45.944
Behave yourself.

01:35:46.994 --> 01:35:47.994
Don't blow it.

01:35:49.621 --> 01:35:51.783
Come on, John. Get it in gear, pal.

01:35:52.583 --> 01:35:54.199
So long, Jeffrey.

01:35:54.293 --> 01:35:56.876
- You two have a nice time tonight, okay?
- Okay.

01:35:56.962 --> 01:35:58.624
What's going on?

01:35:58.714 --> 01:36:01.081
Just a little fatherly advice.

01:36:01.175 --> 01:36:03.258
That's right, Jeffrey.

01:36:03.343 --> 01:36:05.084
Come on.

01:36:05.179 --> 01:36:07.262
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

01:36:07.347 --> 01:36:08.679
Good night, Mom.

01:36:08.766 --> 01:36:10.928
Bye. Have a good time.

01:36:11.018 --> 01:36:12.350
- Night, Sandy.
- Good night, Tom.

01:36:20.277 --> 01:36:22.314
Jeffrey, what was that all about?

01:36:22.404 --> 01:36:23.520
It's nothing.

01:36:24.490 --> 01:36:25.901
Really.

01:36:27.326 --> 01:36:28.783
It's good to see you.

01:36:29.787 --> 01:36:31.574
It's good to see you.

01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:40.127
You look beautiful.

01:36:43.258 --> 01:36:44.544
Thank you.

01:36:52.559 --> 01:36:54.050
Hi.

01:37:00.067 --> 01:37:01.478
Just a minute.

01:37:06.156 --> 01:37:07.988
- Lookin' good!
- Thank you.

01:37:18.794 --> 01:37:20.911
- It's all taken care of.
- Okay.

01:37:21.004 --> 01:37:24.168
Um, you want something to drink?

01:37:26.343 --> 01:37:27.834
Want to dance?

01:37:29.805 --> 01:37:31.296
Yeah.

- Bye.
- Good night.

01:40:09.881 --> 01:40:12.168
- What's goin' on?
- What is it?

01:40:14.302 --> 01:40:16.089
They're gonna hit us.

01:40:17.389 --> 01:40:19.847
- Oh, my God, what's wrong?
- It's Frank.

01:40:27.315 --> 01:40:28.226
Move it!

01:40:28.316 --> 01:40:30.353
Hang on.

01:40:33.947 --> 01:40:35.404
I can't outrun this guy.

01:40:35.490 --> 01:40:38.483
- My father's got a gun at home.
- Jeffrey, no.

01:40:38.577 --> 01:40:40.443
Sandy, this guy's a killer, I promise you.

01:40:45.208 --> 01:40:48.121
It's Mike! Jeffrey, it's Mike. Oh, my God.

01:40:49.254 --> 01:40:50.254
Oh.

01:40:53.341 --> 01:40:55.298
Whoo! Get him, Mike!

01:40:57.304 --> 01:41:00.468
Get outta the car!
Come on! Get outta there!

01:41:01.725 --> 01:41:05.014
You stole my girl, you bastard.
Now I'm gonna kick your ass. Come on!

01:41:05.103 --> 01:41:07.766
Right here, right in front
of your own stupid house.

01:41:07.856 --> 01:41:10.223
- Get outta here!
- Mike, stop it.

01:41:10.317 --> 01:41:12.229
Shut up! Just shut up, all right?

01:41:12.319 --> 01:41:14.732
Nobody's talkin' to you, all right?

01:41:14.821 --> 01:41:17.404
- Come on.
- Mike, look, I don't wanna cause any problems.

01:41:19.117 --> 01:41:21.012
Who's that, huh? Is that your mother?
That your mother?

01:41:21.036 --> 01:41:22.346
- Dorothy.
- That your mother, Jeffrey?

01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:24.724
- No, come here, you Ivy League shit.
- I gotta take care of someone who's hurt,

01:41:24.748 --> 01:41:26.239
in case you didn't notice.

01:41:26.333 --> 01:41:27.369
Dorothy Vallens?

01:41:36.343 --> 01:41:38.380
Come on.

01:41:46.937 --> 01:41:50.226
I'm really... Hey, I... I'm sorry.

01:41:52.317 --> 01:41:53.808
I'm really sorry.

01:41:53.902 --> 01:41:56.519
- I di... I didn't know. I'm really sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:41:57.447 --> 01:41:59.109
I thought you were gonna kill him, man.

01:41:59.199 --> 01:42:00.861
We've gotta get her out of here.

01:42:00.951 --> 01:42:04.240
Take her to my house. My father can
get an ambulance faster than anyone.

01:42:04.329 --> 01:42:06.366
His partner won't be there, will he?

01:42:06.456 --> 01:42:08.448
- No, probably not. Why?
- Nothing.

01:42:08.542 --> 01:42:10.875
Watch out for Mike.

01:42:10.961 --> 01:42:13.578
Oh, God.

01:42:14.923 --> 01:42:17.381
Is that you, Jeffrey?

01:42:17.467 --> 01:42:19.299
Yeah. It's me.

01:42:19.386 --> 01:42:20.877
Oh, Jeffrey.

01:42:21.930 --> 01:42:23.546
Jeffrey.

01:42:29.896 --> 01:42:32.809
Dad? Mom?

01:42:32.899 --> 01:42:35.858
- I'm in here, honey.
- Mom?

01:42:35.944 --> 01:42:38.152
All right, I'll be right there.

01:42:38.238 --> 01:42:40.275
Is Dad home?

01:42:40.365 --> 01:42:42.698
No. He oughta...

01:42:42.784 --> 01:42:45.777
You better call him.
And, uh, get an ambulance.

01:42:45.871 --> 01:42:47.282
Where have you been?

01:42:48.165 --> 01:42:50.407
Oh, God.

01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:52.617
Oh, God, they've hurt him.

01:42:52.711 --> 01:42:55.579
Oh, Jeffrey! Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me!

01:42:55.672 --> 01:42:57.233
- Hold me! Hold me!
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:42:57.257 --> 01:42:59.624
- Oh, God.
- It's okay. Shh. It's okay.

01:43:04.139 --> 01:43:05.971
My secret lover.

01:43:08.226 --> 01:43:11.094
I've called for an ambulance,
and the police are on their way.

01:43:11.188 --> 01:43:13.100
Don't get the police!

01:43:14.649 --> 01:43:16.140
Stop it!

01:43:16.902 --> 01:43:18.985
I love you! Love me!

01:43:22.449 --> 01:43:24.532
He put his disease in me.

01:43:25.577 --> 01:43:28.866
Tell me it's all right
I opened myself to you.

01:43:29.706 --> 01:43:33.495
- Tell me it's all right. It's all right.
- Sandy, please.

01:43:33.585 --> 01:43:34.792
Sandy?

01:43:34.878 --> 01:43:37.086
I'll get a coat to put on her.

01:43:40.884 --> 01:43:42.796
Jeffrey?

01:43:42.886 --> 01:43:45.503
- What's going on here?
- I'll tell you.

01:43:46.681 --> 01:43:49.970
They... They've hurt his head.

01:43:51.019 --> 01:43:52.351
Who, Dorothy?

01:43:53.688 --> 01:43:55.850
Don.

01:43:55.941 --> 01:43:57.432
Help him.

01:43:58.693 --> 01:44:00.309
Help him.

01:44:01.821 --> 01:44:03.858
Promise me you'll help him!

01:44:08.370 --> 01:44:09.736
Okay.

01:44:14.501 --> 01:44:17.084
He put his disease in me.

01:44:35.897 --> 01:44:38.584
Would you like to come with us
in the ambulance or take your own car?

01:44:38.608 --> 01:44:40.440
I'll be right with you.

01:44:48.576 --> 01:44:50.488
I should go.

01:44:50.578 --> 01:44:52.285
- Go.
- Sandy.

01:45:01.006 --> 01:45:03.498
Hold me! I'm falling!

01:45:03.591 --> 01:45:06.379
I'm falling! Hold me!

01:45:13.101 --> 01:45:14.842
You lied to me.

01:45:14.936 --> 01:45:18.429
<i>Sandy, please, forgive me.</i>

01:45:19.274 --> 01:45:20.765
<i>I love you.</i>

01:45:21.693 --> 01:45:23.525
I forgive you, Jeffrey.

01:45:29.326 --> 01:45:31.033
I love you.

01:45:35.582 --> 01:45:37.289
God, I love you.

01:45:39.711 --> 01:45:41.498
I-I...

01:45:41.588 --> 01:45:43.921
But I couldn't watch that.

01:45:49.554 --> 01:45:52.422
- Is she okay?
<i>- Yeah, she's okay.</i>

01:45:52.515 --> 01:45:54.177
<i>Listen, get ahold of your father.</i>

01:45:54.267 --> 01:45:56.412
<i>Tell him to send the police over
to Dorothy's apartment right away.</i>

01:45:56.436 --> 01:45:59.099
Tell him to hurry. I'm leaving right now.

01:45:59.189 --> 01:46:01.431
<i>- Jeffrey, no.</i>
- I have to.

01:46:02.650 --> 01:46:05.358
- I love you.
<i>- Oh, God, be careful.</i>

01:46:05.445 --> 01:46:06.902
I will. Believe me.

01:46:18.875 --> 01:46:20.537
Where is...
