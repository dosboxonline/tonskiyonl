01:32.259 --> 01:33.965
Announcer: October is inventory time,

01:34.052 --> 01:37.636
so right now, statler Toyota
is making the best deals of the year

01:37.723 --> 01:39.839
on all 1985-model toyotas.

01:40.017 --> 01:41.507
You won't find a better car

01:41.602 --> 01:44.890
at a better price with better service
anywhere in hill valley.

01:45.230 --> 01:48.267
That's statler Toyota
in downtown hill valley.

01:51.361 --> 01:54.228
Newscaster: The senate is expected
to vote on this today.

01:54.323 --> 01:58.487
In other news, officials at
the pacific nuclear research facility

01:58.577 --> 02:01.239
have denied the rumor
that a case of missing plutonium

02:01.330 --> 02:04.572
was in fact stolen
from their vault two weeks ago.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.586
A Libyan terrorist group had claimed
responsibility for the alleged theft.

02:08.502 --> 02:13.042
However, officials now attribute
the discrepancy to a simple clerical error.

02:13.550 --> 02:17.293
The FBI, which is investigating the matter,
had no comment.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.381
Marty: Hey, doc?

03:02.974 --> 03:04.089
Doc?

03:05.268 --> 03:07.008
Hello! Anybody home?

03:07.396 --> 03:09.387
Einstein, come here, boy.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.018
What's going on? Oh, god.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.815
Oh, Jesus!

03:15.445 --> 03:18.687
That is disgusting. Where the hell is he?

04:38.779 --> 04:39.939
Whoa!

04:42.824 --> 04:44.314
Rock 'n' roll.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.082
- Yo.
- Doc: Marty, is that you?

04:54.169 --> 04:57.457
- Hey. Hey, doc. Where are you?
- Thank god I've found you.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.959
Listen, can you meet me
at twin pines mall tonight at 1:15?

05:00.050 --> 05:01.861
I made a major breakthrough,
and I'll need your assistance.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.171
- Wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning?
- Yeah.

05:04.262 --> 05:05.923
Doc, what's going on?

05:06.014 --> 05:07.970
- Where you been all week?
- Working.

05:08.058 --> 05:11.221
- Where's Einstein? Is he with you?
- Yeah, he's right here.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.927
You know, doc,
you left your equipment on all week.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.604
My equipment. That reminds me, Marty.

05:16.691 --> 05:20.525
You better not hook up to the amplifier.
There's a slight possibility of overload.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.978
Yeah. I'll keep that in mind.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.485
Good. I'll see you tonight.
Don't forget now.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.361
1:15 A.M., twin pines mall.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.487
Right.

05:35.252 --> 05:39.746
- Are those my clocks I hear?
- Yeah, it's 8:00.

05:40.173 --> 05:44.917
Perfect! My experiment worked!
They're all exactly 25 minutes slow!

05:45.929 --> 05:47.920
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, doc.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.882
- Are you telling me that it's 8:257
- Precisely.

05:52.435 --> 05:55.347
Damn! I'm late for school.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.155
- Jennifer.
- Marty, don't go this way.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.311
Strickland's looking for you.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.667
If you get caught,
it'll be four tardies in a row.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.958
All right, come on. I think we're safe.

07:05.050 --> 07:09.589
You know, this time it wasn't my fault.
The doc set all his clocks 25 minutes slow.

07:09.679 --> 07:10.919
Doc?

07:11.014 --> 07:14.381
Am I to understand you're still hanging
around with Dr. Emmett brown, mcfly?

07:15.894 --> 07:17.976
Tardy slip for you, miss Parker.

07:18.730 --> 07:22.348
And one for you, mcfly.
I believe that makes four in a row.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.400
Let me give you a nickel's worth
of free advice, young man.

07:25.487 --> 07:28.650
This so-called Dr. brown is dangerous.
He's a real nutcase.

07:28.740 --> 07:31.152
You hang around with him,
you're gonna end up in big trouble.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.527
Ooh. Yes, sir.

07:33.244 --> 07:36.828
You got a real attitude problem, mcfly.
You're a slacker.

07:37.082 --> 07:41.200
You remind me of your father
when he went here. He was a slacker, too.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.376
Can I go now, Mr. strickland?

07:43.463 --> 07:47.206
I noticed your band is on the roster
for the dance auditions after school today.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.712
Why even bother, mcfly?
You don't have a chance.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.589
You're too much like your old man.

07:51.680 --> 07:55.719
No mcfly ever amounted to anything
in the history of hill valley.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.847
Yeah, well, history is gonna change.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.438
Next, please.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.399
Okay, guys, let's rock 'n roll.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.073
All right.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.573
We're the... we're the pinheads.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.739
One, two, three.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.436
Okay, that's enough. Thank you, fellas.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.600
Hold it, fellas.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.399
I'm afraid you're just too darn loud.

08:49.154 --> 08:50.690
Next, please.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.198
Bring up the next group, please.

08:57.328 --> 09:00.070
Announcer: Re-elect mayor
"Goldie" Wilson.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.156
Progress is his middle name.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.332
Marty: "Too loud." I can't believe it.

09:04.419 --> 09:07.035
I'm never gonna get a chance
to play in front of anybody.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.496
Marty, one rejection
isn't the end of the world.

09:09.591 --> 09:12.003
I just don't think I'm cut out for music.

09:12.093 --> 09:15.881
But you're good, Marty. You're really good,
and this audition tape of yours is great.

09:15.972 --> 09:18.088
You've gotta send it in
to the record company.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.952
- It's like doc's always saying.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

09:19.976 --> 09:23.639
"If you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything."

09:23.730 --> 09:25.721
That's good advice, Marty.

09:25.815 --> 09:29.307
All right, okay, Jennifer. What if I
send in the tape and they don't like it?

09:29.402 --> 09:31.313
What if they say I'm no good?

09:31.404 --> 09:33.758
What if they say,
"get out of here, kid. You got no future"?

09:33.782 --> 09:36.945
I mean, I just don't think
I can take that kind of rejection.

09:37.035 --> 09:39.026
Jesus, I'm starting to
sound like my old man.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.931
- Come on. He's not that bad.
- Save the clock tower.

09:40.955 --> 09:44.493
At least he's letting you borrow the car
tomorrow night.

09:45.168 --> 09:47.079
Check out that 4x4.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.420
- That is hot.
- Okay. Back her up.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.749
Someday, Jennifer. Someday.

09:54.219 --> 09:57.711
Wouldn't it be great
to take that truck up to the lake?

09:58.723 --> 10:01.715
Throw a couple of sleeping
bags in the back.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.017
Lie out underneath the stars.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.936
Stop it. “What?

10:07.774 --> 10:10.390
Does your mom know?
About tomorrow night?

10:10.485 --> 10:14.524
No, get out of town. My mom thinks
I'm going camping with the guys.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.676
Jennifer, my mother would freak out
if she knew I was going up there with you,

10:17.700 --> 10:19.861
and I'd get the standard lecture about

10:19.953 --> 10:22.319
how she never did that kind of stuff
when she was a kid.

10:22.413 --> 10:25.280
I mean, look,
I think the woman was born a nun.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.866
She's just trying to keep you respectable.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.122
Well, she's not doing a very good job.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.419
Terrible.

10:31.506 --> 10:35.169
Save the clock tower. Save the clock tower.

10:35.260 --> 10:39.299
Mayor Wilson is sponsoring
an initiative to replace that clock.

10:39.389 --> 10:43.803
Thirty years ago, lightning struck that
clock tower and the clock hasn't run since.

10:43.893 --> 10:46.179
We at the hill valley preservation society

10:46.271 --> 10:48.683
think it should be preserved
exactly the way it is

10:48.773 --> 10:50.513
as part of our history and heritage.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.769
- There you go, lady. There's a quarter.
- Thank you.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.977
- Don't forget to take a flyer.
- Right.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.982
Save the clock tower!

10:58.658 --> 11:00.239
Where were we?

11:00.743 --> 11:01.823
Right about here.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.351
Man: Jennifer!

11:06.082 --> 11:08.448
- It's my dad. I've got to go.
- Right.

11:08.543 --> 11:11.205
- I'll call you tonight.
- I'll be at my grandma's.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.708
Here, let me give you the number.

11:18.720 --> 11:19.755
Bye.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.964
Radio dispatcher:
Bravo, tango, delta 6-2-9.

12:06.059 --> 12:09.142
Tow for impoundment.
Any unit, please respond.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.146
Perfect. Just perfect.

12:20.615 --> 12:24.699
I can't believe you'd loan me your car
without telling me it had a blind spot.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.367
- Blind spot?
- I could've been killed.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.078
Now, biff, now, I never noticed

12:29.165 --> 12:33.158
that the car had any blind spot before
when I would drive it.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.663
Hi, son.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.961
Biff: What, are you blind, mcfly?
It's there.

12:37.048 --> 12:38.913
How else do you explain
that wreck out there?

12:39.008 --> 12:42.000
George: Biff, can I assume

12:42.428 --> 12:45.465
that your insurance
is going to pay for the damage?

12:45.556 --> 12:47.842
My insurance? It's your car.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.829
Your insurance should pay for it.
I wanna know who's going to pay for this?

12:50.853 --> 12:52.790
I spilled beer all over it
when the car smashed into me.

12:52.814 --> 12:53.958
Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?

12:53.982 --> 12:54.982
George: Ah...

12:55.066 --> 12:57.022
Biff: And where's my reports?

12:57.110 --> 13:01.353
Well, I haven't finished those up yet, but
I figured since they weren't due till...

13:01.447 --> 13:04.359
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

13:05.076 --> 13:07.362
- Think, mcfly. Think!
- All right.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.535
I got to have time to get them retyped.

13:09.622 --> 13:13.740
Do you realize what would happen if I
hand in my reports in your handwriting?

13:13.835 --> 13:15.371
I'll get fired.

13:15.461 --> 13:18.248
You wouldn't want that to happen,
would you?

13:18.339 --> 13:20.250
- Would you?
- Of course not, biff.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.798
Now, I wouldn't want that to happen.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.718
Now, look.
I'll finish those reports on up tonight,

13:25.805 --> 13:28.638
and I'll run them on over
first thing tomorrow, all right?

13:28.725 --> 13:30.556
Not too early. I sleep in Saturday.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.883
Mcfly, your shoe's untied.

13:31.978 --> 13:32.978
Oh.

13:33.062 --> 13:37.396
Don't be so gullible, mcfly.
Got the place fixed up nice, though, mcfly.

13:39.694 --> 13:41.730
I have your car towed
all the way to your house

13:41.821 --> 13:44.904
and all you got for me is lite beer?

13:51.456 --> 13:53.913
What are you looking at, butthead?

13:55.918 --> 13:57.954
Say hi to your mom for me.

14:00.757 --> 14:05.467
I know what you're going to say, son,
and you're right. You're right.

14:06.637 --> 14:10.550
But biff just happens to be my supervisor,

14:11.809 --> 14:15.267
and I'm afraid I'm just not very good
at confrontations.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.142
But the car, dad.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.604
I mean, he wrecked it. He totaled it.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.611
I needed that car tomorrow night, dad.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.859
Do you have any idea
how important this was to me?

14:27.950 --> 14:28.985
Do you have any clue?

14:29.077 --> 14:31.739
I know, and all I can say is, I'm...

14:32.288 --> 14:33.744
I'm sorry.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.406
Believe me, Marty, you're better off

14:36.501 --> 14:39.413
without having to worry
about all the aggravation

14:39.504 --> 14:42.746
and headaches of playing at that dance.

14:42.840 --> 14:47.083
David: He's absolutely right, Marty.
The last thing you need is headaches.

14:54.936 --> 14:58.554
Kids, we're going to have
to eat this cake by ourselves.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.514
Your uncle Joey didn't make parole again.

15:03.903 --> 15:07.236
I think it would be nice
if you all dropped him a line.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.063
Marty: Uncle "jailbird" Joey?

15:09.158 --> 15:10.614
He's your brother, mom.

15:10.701 --> 15:14.535
Yeah. I think it's a major embarrassment,
having an uncle in prison.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.821
We all make mistakes in life, children.

15:16.916 --> 15:20.374
- God damn it. I'm late.
- David, watch your mouth!

15:20.461 --> 15:23.043
You come here and kiss your mother
before you go. Come here.

15:23.131 --> 15:26.214
Come on, mom. Make it fast.
I'll miss my bus.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.166
See you later, pop.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.003
Time to change that oil.

15:34.142 --> 15:37.680
Hey, Marty. I'm not your answering service.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.182
While you were outside
pouting over the car,

15:40.273 --> 15:42.514
Jennifer Parker called you twice.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.018
I don't like her, Marty.

15:44.110 --> 15:47.227
Any girl who calls up a boy
is just asking for trouble.

15:47.321 --> 15:50.188
Oh, mother, there's nothing wrong
with calling a boy.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.775
I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys.

15:54.203 --> 15:57.536
When I was your age,
I never chased a boy or called a boy

15:57.623 --> 16:00.160
or sat in a parked car with a boy.

16:00.835 --> 16:03.702
Then how am I supposed to
ever meet anybody?

16:04.380 --> 16:08.419
Well, it'll just happen.
Like the way I met your father.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.214
That was so stupid.
Grandpa hit him with the car.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.462
It was meant to be.

16:15.349 --> 16:20.594
Anyway, if grandpa hadn't hit him,
then none of you would have been born.

16:20.688 --> 16:21.973
Yeah, well.

16:22.565 --> 16:25.807
I still don't understand what dad was doing
in the middle of the street.

16:25.902 --> 16:28.359
What was it, George? Bird-watching?

16:28.446 --> 16:30.562
What, Lorraine? What?

16:31.073 --> 16:35.783
Anyway, your grandpa hit him with the car
and brought him into the house.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.074
He seemed so helpless,

16:41.834 --> 16:44.826
like a little lost puppy,
and my heart just went out to him.

16:44.921 --> 16:48.084
Linda: Yeah, mom, we know.
You've told us this story a million times.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.505
You felt sorry for him,

16:49.592 --> 16:52.675
so you decided to go with him
to the fish under the sea dance.

16:52.762 --> 16:55.925
No. It was
the enchantment under the sea dance.

16:56.766 --> 16:59.883
Our first date. I'll never forget it.

17:00.353 --> 17:03.015
It was the night of that terrible
thunderstorm, remember, George?

17:06.692 --> 17:10.605
Your father kissed me for the very
first time on that dance floor.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.693
It was then that I realized

17:14.784 --> 17:17.651
that I was going to spend
the rest of my life with him.

17:46.691 --> 17:47.726
Hello.

17:47.817 --> 17:50.809
- Doc: Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?
- Doc.

17:51.862 --> 17:54.274
No. No, don't be silly.

17:54.657 --> 17:57.615
Listen, this is very important.
I forgot my video camera.

17:57.702 --> 18:00.535
Can you stop by my place
and pick it up on your way to the mall?

18:00.621 --> 18:03.363
Yeah. I'm on my way.

18:27.565 --> 18:29.772
Einstein! Hey, Einstein,
where's the doc, boy?

19:24.914 --> 19:26.029
Doc!

19:27.333 --> 19:29.574
Marty! You made it! Yeah.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.959
Welcome to my latest experiment.
This is the big one,

19:32.046 --> 19:33.911
the one I've been waiting for all my life.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.462
Well, it's a delorean...

19:35.549 --> 19:37.444
Bear with me, Marty.
All your questions will be answered.

19:37.468 --> 19:39.925
- Roll tape and we'll proceed.
- Doc,

19:40.012 --> 19:42.378
- is that a devo suit?
- Never mind that now.

19:42.473 --> 19:44.680
- Not now.
- All right. I'm ready.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.015
Good evening. I'm Dr. Emmett brown.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.264
I'm standing on the parking lot
at twin pines mall.

19:49.355 --> 19:52.939
It's Saturday morning,
October 26, 1985, 1:18 A.M.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.266
And this is temporal experiment number one.

19:55.361 --> 19:59.775
Come on, einie. Hey, hey, boy, get in
there. That a boy! In you go. Sit down.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.231
Put your seat belt on. That's it.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.408
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

20:08.499 --> 20:09.864
Okay.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.826
Please note that Einstein's clock

20:13.921 --> 20:16.879
is in precise synchronization
with my control watch.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.502
- Got it?
- Right. Check, doc.

20:18.592 --> 20:19.592
Good.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.720
Have a good trip, Einstein.
Watch your head.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.996
You got that thing hooked up to the car?

20:32.982 --> 20:36.349
- Watch this.
- Yeah. Okay. Got it.

20:40.489 --> 20:41.649
Jesus!

20:46.537 --> 20:48.198
Not me! The car! The car!

21:05.556 --> 21:07.842
If my calculations are correct,

21:08.392 --> 21:11.008
when this baby hits 88 miles per hour

21:11.479 --> 21:13.515
you're going to see some serious shit.

21:49.517 --> 21:51.223
Watch this. Watch this.

22:09.328 --> 22:15.198
What did I tell you? 88 miles per hour!

22:18.295 --> 22:23.210
The temporal displacement occurred
exactly 1:20 A.M. and zero seconds!

22:24.969 --> 22:26.834
Jesus Christ!

22:26.929 --> 22:29.341
Jesus Christ, doc!
You disintegrated Einstein!

22:29.431 --> 22:32.047
Calm down, Marty.
I didn't disintegrate anything.

22:32.142 --> 22:36.852
The molecular structure of both Einstein
and the car are completely intact.

22:36.939 --> 22:38.304
Then where the hell are they?

22:38.399 --> 22:41.516
The appropriate question is,
"when the hell are they?"

22:41.610 --> 22:46.070
You see, Einstein has just become
the world's first time traveler.

22:46.615 --> 22:49.527
I sent him into the future.

22:50.286 --> 22:52.652
One minute into the future, to be exact.

22:52.746 --> 22:55.954
At precisely 1:21 A.M. and zero seconds,

22:56.041 --> 22:58.908
we shall catch up with him
and the time machine.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.455
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, doc.

23:06.135 --> 23:08.968
Are you telling me that
you built a time machine

23:10.222 --> 23:12.463
- out of a delorean?
- The way I see it,

23:12.558 --> 23:16.346
if you're going to build a time machine
into a car, why not do it with some style?

23:16.437 --> 23:19.554
Besides, the stainless-steel construction
made the flux dispersal...

23:21.233 --> 23:22.643
Look out!

24:07.529 --> 24:10.441
- What? Is it hot?
- It's cold. Damn cold.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.072
Einstein, you little devil!

24:18.540 --> 24:22.829
Einstein's clock is exactly one minute
behind mine and still ticking!

24:26.340 --> 24:27.546
- He's all right.
- He's fine.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.965
And he's completely unaware
that anything happened.

24:30.052 --> 24:32.634
As far as he's concerned,
the trip was instantaneous.

24:32.721 --> 24:35.303
That's why his watch is exactly
one minute behind mine.

24:35.391 --> 24:38.474
He skipped over that minute
to instantly arrive at this moment in time.

24:38.560 --> 24:41.222
- Come here. I'll show you how it works.
- All right.

24:43.232 --> 24:45.974
First, you turn the time circuits on.

24:50.072 --> 24:52.759
This readout tells you where you're going.
This one tells you where you are.

24:52.783 --> 24:54.273
This one tells you where you were.

24:54.368 --> 24:56.654
You input your destination time
on this keypad.

24:56.745 --> 25:00.658
Say you want to see the signing
of the declaration of independence.

25:02.418 --> 25:04.750
Or witness the birth of Christ.

25:07.548 --> 25:10.164
Here's a red-letter date
in the history of science.

25:10.259 --> 25:12.921
November 5th, 1955.

25:16.765 --> 25:21.054
Yes, of course. November 5th, 1955.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.636
What? I don't get it. What happened?

25:24.898 --> 25:28.686
That was the day I invented time travel.
I remember it vividly.

25:29.278 --> 25:31.423
I was standing on the edge of my toilet,
hanging a clock.

25:31.447 --> 25:34.208
The porcelain was wet. I slipped,
hit my head on the edge of the sink,

25:34.283 --> 25:36.319
and when I came to, I had a revelation,

25:36.410 --> 25:39.743
a vision, a picture in my head,
a picture of this.

25:40.497 --> 25:45.116
This is what makes time travel possible.
The flux capacitor.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.034
Flux capacitor?

25:47.129 --> 25:49.541
It's taken me almost 30 years
and my entire family fortune

25:49.631 --> 25:52.043
to realize the vision of that day.

25:52.134 --> 25:54.420
My god, has it been that long?

25:55.095 --> 25:57.928
Things have certainly changed around here.

25:58.891 --> 26:02.975
I remember when this was all farmland
as far as the eye could see.

26:04.229 --> 26:06.641
Old man peabody owned all of this.

26:07.941 --> 26:11.479
He had this crazy idea
about breeding pine trees.

26:15.616 --> 26:19.074
This is heavy-duty, doc. This is great.

26:19.536 --> 26:22.073
Does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?

26:22.164 --> 26:25.952
Unfortunately, no. It requires something
with a little more kick. Plutonium.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.283
Plutonium. Wait a minute.

26:28.378 --> 26:30.744
Are you telling me
that this sucker is nuclear?

26:30.839 --> 26:32.830
Hey, hey, hey! Keep rolling.
Keep rolling there.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.756
No, no, no, this sucker's electrical,

26:34.843 --> 26:38.586
but I need a nuclear reaction to generate
the 1.21 gigawatts of electricity I need.

26:38.680 --> 26:42.264
Doc, you don't just walk into a store
and buy plutonium.

26:42.851 --> 26:44.512
Did you rip that off?

26:46.647 --> 26:49.263
Of course.
From a group of Libyan nationalists.

26:49.358 --> 26:50.627
They wanted me to build them a bomb,

26:50.651 --> 26:53.171
so I took their plutonium and, in turn,
gave them a shoddy bomb casing

26:53.195 --> 26:54.935
full of used pinball machine parts.

26:55.030 --> 26:57.008
- Come on. Let's get you a radiation suit.
- Jesus!

26:57.032 --> 26:58.397
We must prepare to reload.

27:27.563 --> 27:30.020
It's safe now. Everything's lead-lined.

27:31.942 --> 27:35.560
Don't you lose those tapes now.
I need that as a record.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.521
Let's put this back here. There we go.

27:40.868 --> 27:42.654
I almost forgot my luggage.

27:42.744 --> 27:45.486
Who knows if they've got
cotton underwear in the future?

27:45.581 --> 27:48.573
- I'm allergic to all synthetics.
- The future?

27:49.376 --> 27:52.063
- That's where you're going?
- That's right, 25 years into the future.

27:52.087 --> 27:55.124
I've always dreamed of seeing the future,
looking beyond my years,

27:55.215 --> 27:57.331
seeing the progress of mankind.

27:57.426 --> 27:58.632
Why not?

27:58.719 --> 28:02.507
I'll also be able to see
who wins the next 25 world series.

28:02.890 --> 28:04.005
Doc.

28:04.099 --> 28:05.134
Huh?

28:05.309 --> 28:07.721
Look me up when you get there.

28:08.437 --> 28:10.974
Indeed, I will. Roll 'em.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.778
I, Dr. Emmett brown,

28:21.366 --> 28:24.233
am about to embark on an historic journey.

28:26.163 --> 28:30.281
What am I thinking of?
I almost forgot to bring extra plutonium.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.912
How did I ever expect to get back?
One pellet, one trip.

28:33.003 --> 28:34.618
I must be out of my mind.

28:37.591 --> 28:39.252
What is it, einie?

28:47.726 --> 28:49.262
Oh, my god.

28:49.353 --> 28:52.140
They found me.
I don't know how, but they found me.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.438
Run for it, Marty! “Who? Who?

28:54.900 --> 28:57.312
Who do you think? The Libyans!

29:00.614 --> 29:02.104
Holy shit!

29:06.161 --> 29:07.992
I'll draw their fire!

29:15.963 --> 29:16.998
Doc, wait!

29:31.603 --> 29:32.683
No!

29:33.897 --> 29:35.478
You bastard!

29:54.334 --> 29:55.619
Go! Damn Soviet gun.

30:01.633 --> 30:02.668
Gol

30:43.550 --> 30:45.882
Come on! Move, damn it!

30:47.304 --> 30:48.635
Jesus!

31:08.784 --> 31:10.240
Holy shit!

31:10.994 --> 31:13.701
Let's see if you bastards can do 90.

32:05.507 --> 32:07.873
What is it? What is it, pa?

32:08.593 --> 32:11.881
Looks like an airplane without wings.

32:12.431 --> 32:15.264
That ain't no airplane. Look.

32:36.329 --> 32:37.569
Children!

32:37.664 --> 32:38.995
Listen... whoa.

32:51.678 --> 32:52.884
Hello?

32:56.016 --> 32:57.381
Excuse me.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.052
Sorry about your barn.

33:05.817 --> 33:09.105
It's already mutated into human form!
Shoot it!

33:11.031 --> 33:13.363
Take that, you mutated son of a bitch!

33:17.579 --> 33:18.739
Boy: Get away!

33:19.998 --> 33:21.078
Man: Hold it.

33:21.458 --> 33:23.039
Boy: Shoot it, pa!

33:25.462 --> 33:28.499
My pine! Why you...

33:30.550 --> 33:33.963
You space bastard! You killed our pine!

33:38.350 --> 33:42.514
All right. All right. Okay, mcfly.
Get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream.

33:42.604 --> 33:45.391
It's just a very intense dream.

34:28.650 --> 34:32.268
- Listen, you got to help me.
- Don't stop, wilbur! Don't!

34:34.322 --> 34:35.322
It can't be.

34:41.746 --> 34:42.746
This is nuts.

34:47.502 --> 34:48.786
Come on.

34:49.795 --> 34:51.081
Perfect.

36:46.496 --> 36:50.034
Announcer: Remember, fellow citizens,
the future is in your hands.

36:50.125 --> 36:53.913
If you believe in progress,
re-elect mayor red Thomas.

36:54.003 --> 36:58.713
Progress is his middle name.
Mayor red Thomas' progress platform

36:58.800 --> 37:04.215
means more jobs, better education,
bigger civic improvements and lower taxes.

37:04.597 --> 37:08.306
On election day,
cast your vote for a proven leader.

37:08.393 --> 37:10.725
Re-elect mayor red Thomas.

37:14.023 --> 37:16.184
This has got to be a dream.

37:33.001 --> 37:35.959
Lou: Hey, kid. What'd you do? Jump ship?

37:36.045 --> 37:38.787
- What?
- What's with the life preserver?

37:43.762 --> 37:47.346
- I just want to use the phone.
- Yeah, it's in the back.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.599
Marty: Brown.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.186
Great. You're alive.

38:07.368 --> 38:08.699
Come on.

38:16.127 --> 38:20.712
- Do you know where 1640 riverside...
- Are you going to order something, kid?

38:22.342 --> 38:24.674
Yeah. Give me a tab.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.965
Tab? I can't give you a tab
unless you order something.

38:28.056 --> 38:30.138
Right. Give me a Pepsi free.

38:30.225 --> 38:32.967
You want a Pepsi, pal,
you're going to pay for it.

38:33.061 --> 38:36.269
Just give me something
without any sugar in it, okay?

38:36.356 --> 38:38.347
Something without sugar.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.196
Biff: Hey, mcfly.

38:49.619 --> 38:51.905
What do you think you're doing?

38:52.205 --> 38:53.285
Biff.

38:53.540 --> 38:56.031
I'm talking to you, mcfly, you Irish bug!

38:56.125 --> 39:00.118
- Hey, biff. Hey, guys. How are you doing?
- You got my homework finished, mcfly?

39:00.755 --> 39:03.462
Well, actually, I figured
since it wasn't due till Monday...

39:03.550 --> 39:05.336
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?

39:06.928 --> 39:08.793
Think, mcfly. Think! Okay.

39:08.888 --> 39:10.753
I got to have time to recopy it.

39:10.849 --> 39:14.592
You realize what would happen if I hand in
my homework in your handwriting?

39:14.686 --> 39:16.392
I'll get kicked out of school.

39:16.479 --> 39:18.936
You wouldn't want that to happen,
would you?

39:21.234 --> 39:22.974
- Would you?
- Now, of course not, biff.

39:23.069 --> 39:24.980
- No.
- I wouldn't want that to happen.

39:25.071 --> 39:29.030
- What are you looking at, butthead?
- Biff, get a load of this guy's life preserver.

39:29.117 --> 39:30.823
Dork thinks he's going to drown.

39:30.910 --> 39:33.196
How about my homework, mcfly?

39:33.913 --> 39:37.201
Okay, biff. Well, I'll
finish that on up tonight

39:37.292 --> 39:40.580
and then I'll bring it over
first thing tomorrow morning.

39:40.670 --> 39:43.582
Not too early. I sleep in Sundays.
Oh, mcfly, your shoe's untied!

39:44.799 --> 39:46.835
- Don't be so gullible, mcfly.
- Okay.

39:46.926 --> 39:50.794
- I don't want to see you in here again.
- Okay. All right. Bye-bye.

40:12.619 --> 40:14.985
- What?
- You're George mcfly.

40:15.538 --> 40:16.903
Yeah. Who are you?

40:16.998 --> 40:20.206
Say! Why do you let those boys
push you around like that for?

40:20.293 --> 40:21.578
Well, they're bigger than me.

40:21.669 --> 40:24.285
Stand tall, boy.
Have some respect for yourself.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.587
Don't you know,
if you let people walk over you now,

40:26.674 --> 40:28.794
they'll be walking over you
for the rest of your life.

40:28.843 --> 40:32.006
Look at me. You think I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life in this slop house?

40:32.096 --> 40:33.882
- Lou: Watch it, Goldie.
- No, sir!

40:33.973 --> 40:36.464
I'm gonna make something of myself.
I'm going to night school,

40:36.559 --> 40:38.766
and one day, I'm going to be somebody.

40:38.853 --> 40:40.718
That's right. He's going to be mayor.

40:40.813 --> 40:42.178
Yeah, I'm...

40:42.857 --> 40:44.222
Mayor!

40:44.984 --> 40:48.897
Now that's a good idea!
I could run for mayor.

40:48.988 --> 40:50.478
A colored mayor. That'll be the day.

40:50.573 --> 40:52.905
You wait and see, Mr. caruthers.
I will be mayor.

40:52.992 --> 40:57.156
I'll be the most powerful man in hill valley,
and I'm going to clean up this town.

40:57.246 --> 41:00.204
Good. You can start by sweeping the floor.

41:02.752 --> 41:06.870
Mayor Goldie Wilson.
I like the sound of that.

41:19.394 --> 41:22.807
Hey, dad! George! Hey, you on the bike!

41:54.095 --> 41:56.131
He's a peeping Tom.

42:01.811 --> 42:02.846
Dad!

42:14.907 --> 42:17.694
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Who are you?

42:19.704 --> 42:23.993
Stella! Another one of these damn kids
jumped in front of my car!

42:25.001 --> 42:28.164
Come on out here!
Help me take him in the house!

42:33.217 --> 42:35.674
Mom? That you?

42:36.721 --> 42:39.758
Lorraine: There, there, now. Just relax.

42:42.393 --> 42:45.430
You've been asleep
for almost nine hours now.

42:47.273 --> 42:49.730
I had a horrible nightmare.

42:50.777 --> 42:55.316
I dreamed that I went back in time.
It was terrible.

42:56.574 --> 42:57.689
Well,

42:58.326 --> 43:01.784
you're safe and sound now,
back in good old 1955.

43:02.872 --> 43:04.282
19557

43:09.087 --> 43:13.126
- you're my... you're my...
- My name is Lorraine.

43:14.592 --> 43:16.924
Lorraine baines. Yeah.

43:18.054 --> 43:20.716
But you're... you're so...

43:21.265 --> 43:24.302
You're so thin!

43:24.685 --> 43:28.098
Just relax, Calvin.
You got a big bruise on your head.

43:32.235 --> 43:37.400
- Where are my pants?
- Over there, on my hope chest.

43:39.283 --> 43:41.899
I've never seen
purple underwear before, Calvin.

43:42.703 --> 43:45.490
Calvin? Why do you keep calling me Calvin?

43:45.581 --> 43:48.493
Well, that is your name, isn't it?
Calvin klein?

43:49.043 --> 43:51.705
It's written all over your underwear.

43:52.088 --> 43:54.500
Oh, I guess they call you Cal, huh?

43:54.841 --> 43:58.550
No, actually, people call me Marty.

43:58.886 --> 44:00.001
Oh.

44:00.638 --> 44:03.050
Pleased to meet you, Calvin.

44:03.975 --> 44:05.340
Marty.

44:06.769 --> 44:08.134
Klein.

44:14.777 --> 44:18.110
- Do you mind if I sit here?
- No. Fine.

44:18.197 --> 44:20.563
No. Good. Fine. Good.

44:22.577 --> 44:24.784
That's a big bruise you have there.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.829
Stella: Lorraine, are you up there?

44:28.916 --> 44:33.956
Oh, my god! It's my mother!
Quick! Put your pants back on!

44:42.221 --> 44:45.008
Stella: So, tell me, Marty,
how long have you been in port?

44:45.099 --> 44:47.181
- Marty: Excuse me?
- I guessed you're a sailor.

44:47.268 --> 44:51.011
- That's why you wear that life preserver.
- Coast guard.

44:51.105 --> 44:54.518
Sam, here's the young man
you hit with your car out there.

44:54.609 --> 44:55.689
He's all right. Thank god.

44:55.776 --> 44:58.046
What were you doing in the middle
of the street, a kid your age?

44:58.070 --> 45:00.048
Don't pay attention to him.
He's in one of his moods.

45:00.072 --> 45:03.155
Sam, you quit fiddling with that thing.
Come in here to dinner.

45:03.242 --> 45:05.233
Now, let's see. You already know Lorraine.

45:05.328 --> 45:09.162
This is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby,

45:09.248 --> 45:12.456
and over there in the playpen
is little baby Joey.

45:14.128 --> 45:16.119
So, you're my uncle Joey.

45:17.006 --> 45:19.372
Better get used to these bars, kid.

45:19.467 --> 45:23.585
Yes. Joey just loves being in his playpen.

45:24.055 --> 45:27.468
He cries whenever we take him out,
so we just leave him in there all the time.

45:27.558 --> 45:29.765
Well, Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.

45:29.852 --> 45:33.344
- Listen, I really ought to...
- Sit here, Marty.

45:33.940 --> 45:38.354
Sam, stop fiddling with that thing
and come in here and eat your dinner.

45:40.154 --> 45:41.894
Look at it roll.

45:41.989 --> 45:44.025
Now we can watch Jackie gleason
while we eat.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.492
It's our first television set.
Dad just picked it up today.

45:57.380 --> 45:59.462
Do you have a television?

45:59.548 --> 46:02.415
Well, yeah. You know we have two of them.

46:02.510 --> 46:05.297
Wow! You must be rich.

46:05.388 --> 46:09.472
Oh, honey, he's teasing you.
Nobody has two television sets.

46:14.522 --> 46:18.310
Hey. Hey, I've seen this one.
I've seen this one! This is a classic.

46:18.401 --> 46:21.689
This is where Ralph dresses up
as a man from space.

46:21.779 --> 46:25.192
What do you mean, you've seen this?
It's brand-new.

46:25.283 --> 46:27.615
Yeah, well, I saw it on a rerun.

46:28.369 --> 46:31.361
What's a rerun? You'll find out.

46:31.872 --> 46:36.036
You know, Marty, you look so familiar
to me. Do I know your mother?

46:37.461 --> 46:39.497
Yeah, I think maybe you do.

46:39.588 --> 46:42.921
Stella: Oh, then I want to give her a call.
I don't want her to worry about you.

46:43.009 --> 46:44.374
You can't.

46:45.261 --> 46:48.549
That is, nobody's home.

46:49.849 --> 46:50.929
Oh.

46:51.309 --> 46:52.424
Yet.

46:52.977 --> 46:54.057
Oh.

46:54.687 --> 46:58.555
Listen, do you know
where riverside drive is?

46:58.649 --> 47:02.767
It's on the other end of town.
A block past maple. East end of town.

47:02.862 --> 47:06.821
Wait a minute, a block past maple.
That's John F. Kennedy drive.

47:07.700 --> 47:09.691
Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?

47:09.785 --> 47:11.070
Lorraine: Mother?

47:11.704 --> 47:14.320
With Marty's parents out of town,

47:14.874 --> 47:17.286
don't you think he ought
to spend the night?

47:17.376 --> 47:19.788
I mean, after all,
dad almost killed him with the car.

47:20.004 --> 47:21.960
That's true, Marty.

47:22.048 --> 47:25.290
I think maybe you should spend the night.
I think you're our responsibility.

47:25.384 --> 47:28.842
- Gee, I don't know.
- And he can sleep in my room.

47:29.555 --> 47:33.013
I gotta go! I gotta go! Thanks very much.
It was wonderful.

47:33.100 --> 47:37.434
You were all great. See you all later.
Much later.

47:41.901 --> 47:45.439
- He's a very strange young man.
- He's an idiot.

47:46.238 --> 47:49.947
Comes from upbringing.
His parents are probably idiots, too.

47:50.326 --> 47:53.910
Lorraine, you ever have a kid
who acts that way, I'll disown you.

48:31.992 --> 48:33.072
Doc?

48:33.994 --> 48:35.530
Don't say a word.

48:36.831 --> 48:39.226
I don't wanna know your name.
I don't want to know anything about you.

48:39.250 --> 48:40.990
- Listen, doc...
- Quiet!

48:41.085 --> 48:42.646
- Doc, it's me, Marty.
- Don't tell me anything.

48:42.670 --> 48:44.831
- Doc, you got to help...
- Quiet. Quiet.

48:47.591 --> 48:49.582
I'm going to read your thoughts.

48:49.677 --> 48:53.261
Let's see now.
You've come here from a great distance?

48:53.347 --> 48:55.679
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Don't tell me!

48:56.350 --> 48:59.183
You want me to buy a subscription
to the Saturday evening post.

48:59.270 --> 49:01.852
- No.
- Not a word. Not a word now!

49:01.939 --> 49:03.099
Quiet.

49:05.276 --> 49:11.192
Donations. You want me to make a donation
to the coast guard youth auxiliary.

49:11.782 --> 49:13.192
Doc.

49:14.702 --> 49:15.737
I'm from the future.

49:16.912 --> 49:20.029
I came here in a time machine
that you invented.

49:20.416 --> 49:25.206
Now, I need your help
to get back to the year 1985.

49:26.589 --> 49:28.170
My god.

49:32.595 --> 49:34.802
Do you know what this means?

49:36.474 --> 49:40.808
It means that this damn thing
doesn't work at all!

49:40.895 --> 49:42.806
Doc, you got to help me.
You are the only one

49:42.897 --> 49:45.229
who knows how your time machine works.

49:45.316 --> 49:49.150
Time machine?
I haven't invented any time machine.

49:51.071 --> 49:53.483
Okay. All right, I'll prove it to you.

49:53.574 --> 49:56.737
Look at my driver's license. Expires 1987.

49:56.827 --> 50:00.411
Look at my birthday, for crying out loud!
I haven't even been born yet.

50:00.498 --> 50:04.912
And look at this picture.
It's my brother, my sister and me.

50:05.002 --> 50:08.290
Look at her sweatshirt, doc.
"Class of 1984"?

50:09.256 --> 50:13.590
Pretty mediocre photographic fakery.
They cut off your brother's hair.

50:14.136 --> 50:16.502
I'm telling the truth, doc.
You got to believe me.

50:16.597 --> 50:18.679
Then tell me, future boy,

50:19.850 --> 50:23.593
who's President of the United States
in 19857?

50:24.021 --> 50:27.513
- Ronald Reagan.
- Ronald Reagan? The actor?

50:29.109 --> 50:31.646
Then who's vice president? Jerry Lewis?

50:32.821 --> 50:36.359
- I suppose Jane Wyman is the first lady.
- Whoa. Wait, doc!

50:36.450 --> 50:38.657
And Jack Benny is secretary
of the treasury.

50:38.744 --> 50:40.154
Doc, you gotta listen to me.

50:40.246 --> 50:43.579
I've had enough practical jokes
for one evening. Good night, future boy!

50:43.666 --> 50:45.031
No, wait, doc. Doc.

50:45.125 --> 50:47.912
The bruise on your head,
I know how that happened.

50:48.003 --> 50:49.413
You told me the whole story.

50:49.505 --> 50:52.087
You were standing on your toilet
and you were hanging a clock,

50:52.174 --> 50:54.381
and you fell
and you hit your head on the sink.

50:54.468 --> 50:57.380
That's when you came up
with the idea for the flux capacitor,

50:57.471 --> 51:01.464
which is what makes time travel possible.

51:14.572 --> 51:18.736
There's something wrong with the starter,
so I hid it here.

51:29.253 --> 51:33.087
After I fell off my toilet, I drew this.

51:37.595 --> 51:39.381
The flux capacitor.

51:57.239 --> 51:58.524
It works!

52:01.076 --> 52:02.612
It works!

52:03.912 --> 52:06.619
I finally invent something that works!

52:07.374 --> 52:09.490
You bet your ass it works.

52:10.419 --> 52:13.456
Somehow we've got to sneak this
back to my laboratory.

52:16.133 --> 52:17.919
Okay, doc, this is it.

52:19.720 --> 52:21.802
Never mind that. Never mind that now.

52:21.889 --> 52:25.302
Why, that's me! Look at me! I'm an old man.

52:25.392 --> 52:26.703
Good evening. I'm Dr. Emmett brown.

52:26.727 --> 52:28.809
I'm standing on the parking lot
at twin pines mall.

52:28.896 --> 52:30.887
Thank god, I've still got my hair.

52:30.981 --> 52:32.972
What's on earth is this thing I'm wearing?

52:33.067 --> 52:35.228
This is a radiation suit.

52:35.319 --> 52:37.059
Radiation suit?

52:37.154 --> 52:40.146
Of course. 'Cause of all the fallout
from the atomic wars.

52:41.492 --> 52:44.154
This is truly amazing.

52:44.662 --> 52:47.495
A portable television studio.

52:47.581 --> 52:51.324
No wonder your president has to be an
actor. He's gotta look good on television.

52:51.418 --> 52:53.830
Whoa. This is it.
This is the part coming up, doc.

52:54.588 --> 52:56.044
No, no, no, this suckers electrical,

52:56.131 --> 52:59.043
but I need a nuclear reaction to generate
the 1.21 gigawatts...

52:59.134 --> 53:00.920
What did I just say?

53:04.932 --> 53:06.012
This sucker's electrical,

53:06.100 --> 53:09.012
but I need a nuclear reaction to generate
the 1.21 gigawatts...

53:09.103 --> 53:11.435
1.21 gigawatts!

53:12.940 --> 53:15.147
1.21 gigawatts.

53:17.152 --> 53:18.767
Great Scott!

53:20.948 --> 53:23.155
What the hell is a gigawatt?

53:24.159 --> 53:28.243
How could I have been so careless?
1.21 gigawatts!

53:28.330 --> 53:31.037
Tom, how am I going to generate
that kind of power?

53:31.125 --> 53:32.740
It can't be done, can it?

53:32.835 --> 53:35.577
Doc, look. All we need
is a little plutonium.

53:36.797 --> 53:40.790
I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is
available in every corner drugstore,

53:40.884 --> 53:43.626
but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by.

53:43.721 --> 53:47.054
Marty, I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid you're stuck here.

53:47.307 --> 53:48.307
Whoa, whoa.

53:48.392 --> 53:52.806
Doc, stuck here? I can't be stuck here.
I got a life in 1985.

53:52.896 --> 53:55.103
- I got a girl.
- Is she pretty?

53:55.649 --> 53:59.608
Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me.

53:59.695 --> 54:03.984
Look at this. Look what she wrote
here, doc. I mean, that says it all.

54:05.242 --> 54:07.824
Doc, you're my only hope.

54:08.495 --> 54:11.828
Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source
capable of generating

54:11.915 --> 54:15.328
1.21 gigawatts of electricity
is a bolt of lightning.

54:16.545 --> 54:18.911
- What did you say?
- A bolt of lightning.

54:19.006 --> 54:23.215
Unfortunately, you never know
when or where it's ever going to strike.

54:24.720 --> 54:26.085
We do now.

54:31.185 --> 54:34.769
This is it! This is the answer.

54:35.522 --> 54:37.934
It says here that a bolt of lightning

54:38.025 --> 54:42.359
is going to strike the clock tower at
precisely 10:04 P.M. next Saturday night!

54:45.908 --> 54:49.366
If we could somehow harness this lightning,

54:50.537 --> 54:53.779
channel it into the flux capacitor,

54:55.083 --> 54:56.869
it just might work.

54:57.169 --> 55:01.412
Next Saturday night,
we're sending you back to the future!

55:02.382 --> 55:04.319
Okay, all right. Saturday's good.
Saturday's good.

55:04.343 --> 55:07.961
I can spend a week in 19585. I can
hang out. You can show me around.

55:08.055 --> 55:11.297
Marty, that is completely out of the
question. You must not leave this house.

55:11.391 --> 55:13.382
You must not see anybody
or talk to anybody.

55:13.477 --> 55:16.059
Anything you do can have
serious repercussions on future events.

55:16.146 --> 55:17.886
Do you understand?

55:18.774 --> 55:20.730
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

55:21.360 --> 55:22.566
Marty,

55:22.986 --> 55:26.444
have you interacted with anybody
else today, besides me?

55:28.242 --> 55:31.359
Yeah, well, I might've sort of
bumped into my parents.

55:31.453 --> 55:35.366
Great Scott! Let me see
that photograph again of your brother.

55:38.752 --> 55:42.165
Just as I thought. This proves my theory.
Look at your brother.

55:43.423 --> 55:46.631
Marty: His head's gone.
It's like it's been erased.

55:48.303 --> 55:50.339
Erased from existence.

55:54.935 --> 55:56.015
Whoa.

55:56.103 --> 55:58.845
They really cleaned this place up.
Looks brand-new.

55:58.939 --> 55:59.939
Doc: Now remember.

56:00.023 --> 56:02.585
According to my theory, you interfered
with your parents' first meeting.

56:02.609 --> 56:03.920
If they don't meet, they
won't fall in love,

56:03.944 --> 56:05.797
they won't get married
and they won't have kids.

56:05.821 --> 56:08.258
That's why your older brother's
disappearing from that photograph.

56:08.282 --> 56:11.774
Your sister will follow, and unless
you repair the damage, you'll be next.

56:11.869 --> 56:14.469
- Marty:: Sounds pretty heavy.
- Weight has nothing to do with it.

56:14.913 --> 56:16.778
Which one's your pop?

56:17.958 --> 56:19.289
That's him.

56:19.751 --> 56:22.163
Okay. Okay, you guys.

56:23.797 --> 56:27.039
Very funny. You guys are being real mature.

56:27.134 --> 56:28.999
Maybe you were adopted.

56:29.094 --> 56:31.631
Okay, real mature, guys.

56:32.556 --> 56:35.047
- Okay, pick up my books.
- Mcfly.

56:35.142 --> 56:36.848
That's strickland.

56:37.311 --> 56:39.393
Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

56:39.479 --> 56:42.221
Shape up, man. You're a slacker.

56:42.316 --> 56:45.399
Do you want to be a slacker
for the rest of your life?

56:45.485 --> 56:46.520
No.

56:46.904 --> 56:49.816
- What did your mother ever see in that kid?
- I don't know, doc.

56:49.907 --> 56:54.025
I guess she felt sorry for him
'cause her dad hit him with the car.

56:54.328 --> 56:56.569
Hit me with the car.

56:56.663 --> 56:58.654
That's the Florence nightingale effect.

56:58.749 --> 57:02.082
It happens in hospitals when nurses
fall in love with their patients.

57:02.169 --> 57:03.409
Go to it, kid.

57:04.254 --> 57:07.087
Hey, George, buddy.

57:07.674 --> 57:10.040
I have been looking all over for you.

57:10.135 --> 57:13.093
You remember me,
the guy who saved your life the other day?

57:13.180 --> 57:14.260
Oh.

57:14.348 --> 57:15.348
- Yeah.
- Good.

57:15.432 --> 57:17.423
There's somebody I'd like you to meet.

57:21.855 --> 57:24.642
- Lorraine?
- Calvin!

57:26.109 --> 57:28.851
I'd like you to meet
my good friend George mcfly.

57:28.946 --> 57:32.188
Hi. It's really a pleasure to meet you.

57:33.367 --> 57:35.824
- How's your head?
- Good. Fine.

57:35.911 --> 57:39.745
Oh. I've been so worried about you
ever since you ran off the other night.

57:39.831 --> 57:41.287
Are you okay? Yeah.

57:42.542 --> 57:45.124
- I'm sorry. I have to go.
- Come on!

57:45.963 --> 57:47.794
Isn't he a dreamboat?

57:51.927 --> 57:55.135
- Doc, she didn't even look at him.
- This is more serious than I thought.

57:55.222 --> 57:58.931
Apparently, your mother is amorously
infatuated with you, instead of your father.

57:59.518 --> 58:00.633
Whoa. Wait a minute, doc.

58:00.727 --> 58:04.390
Are you trying to tell me
that my mother has got the hots for me?

58:04.481 --> 58:06.722
- Precisely.
- Whoa. This is heavy.

58:07.317 --> 58:09.399
There's that word again. "Heavy."

58:09.486 --> 58:10.880
Why are things so heavy in the future?

58:10.904 --> 58:13.049
Is there a problem
with the earth's gravitational pull?

58:13.073 --> 58:14.153
- What?
- The only way

58:14.241 --> 58:15.718
we're going to get those two
to successfully mate

58:15.742 --> 58:17.107
is if they're alone together,

58:17.202 --> 58:19.818
so you've got to get
your father and mother to interact

58:19.913 --> 58:21.995
in some sort of social...

58:23.333 --> 58:24.869
- What? You mean like a date?
- Right!

58:26.086 --> 58:28.793
What kind of date”? I don't know.
What do kids do in the '50s?

58:28.880 --> 58:31.667
They're your parents. You must know them.

58:31.758 --> 58:34.921
What are their common interests?
What do they like to do together?

58:35.929 --> 58:37.009
Nothing.

58:37.097 --> 58:40.305
Look! There's a rhythmic
ceremonial ritual coming up.

58:40.392 --> 58:43.805
Of course! The enchantment under the sea
dance! They're supposed to go to this.

58:43.895 --> 58:47.103
- That's where they kiss for the first time.
- All right, kid.

58:47.190 --> 58:50.398
You stick to your father like glue
and make sure he takes her to that dance.

58:51.111 --> 58:52.601
George, buddy.

58:53.447 --> 58:56.689
Remember that girl
I introduced you to, Lorraine?

59:02.748 --> 59:06.457
- What are you writing?
- Uh... stories.

59:07.294 --> 59:10.832
Science fiction stories about visitors

59:11.298 --> 59:14.540
coming down to earth from other planets.

59:16.595 --> 59:20.258
Get out of town!
I didn't know you did anything creative.

59:20.766 --> 59:23.553
- Let me read some.
- Oh. No, no, no, no.

59:23.643 --> 59:26.476
I never let anybody read my stories.

59:27.230 --> 59:28.470
Why not?

59:28.899 --> 59:33.313
Well, what if they didn't like them?
What if they told me I was no good?

59:35.405 --> 59:38.238
I guess that would be pretty hard
for somebody to understand.

59:39.659 --> 59:42.241
No. No, not hard at all.

59:43.455 --> 59:45.992
So, anyway, George. About Lorraine.

59:47.167 --> 59:48.998
She really likes you.

59:49.961 --> 59:52.919
She told me to tell you
that she wants you to ask her

59:53.006 --> 59:54.746
to the enchantment under the sea dance.

59:54.841 --> 59:56.001
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

59:56.093 --> 59:59.176
All you got to do is go over there
and ask her.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:02.258
What? Right here, right now,
in the cafeteria?

01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:06.968
What if she said no? I don't know
if I could take that kind of a rejection.

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:11.684
Besides, I think she'd rather go
with somebody else.

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:14.186
Who?

01:00:15.987 --> 01:00:17.102
Biff.

01:00:18.657 --> 01:00:21.114
- Don't kid around. Come on.
- I'm gonna leave.

01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:25.285
Biff: You want it. You know you want it.
You know you want me to give it to you.

01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:27.954
Shut your filthy mouth.
I'm not that kind of girl.

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:31.951
Maybe you are
and you just don't know it yet.

01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:33.876
Get your meat hooks off of me.

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:38.458
You heard her.
She said, get your meat hooks off.

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:41.126
Please.

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:44.054
So what's it to you, butthead?

01:00:45.183 --> 01:00:47.424
You know, you been looking for a fight.

01:00:57.362 --> 01:01:01.401
Since you're new here,
I'm going to cut you a break, today.

01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:06.986
So, why don't you make like a tree
and get out of here.

01:01:19.718 --> 01:01:20.924
George!

01:01:22.262 --> 01:01:24.298
Why do you keep following me around?

01:01:24.389 --> 01:01:29.179
Look, George... I'm telling you, George,
if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance,

01:01:29.269 --> 01:01:32.309
- I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.
- But I can't go to the dance.

01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:35.514
I'll miss my favorite television program,
science fiction theatre.

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:40.194
Yeah, but, George, Lorraine wants
to go with you. Give her a break.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:44.444
Look, I'm just not ready
to ask Lorraine out to the dance,

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:48.451
and not you or anybody else on this planet

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:51.120
is going to make me change my mind.

01:01:57.923 --> 01:01:59.914
Marty: Science fiction theatre.

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:32.533
Who are you?

01:02:38.129 --> 01:02:40.165
Marty: Silence, earthling.

01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:44.090
My name is Darth Vader.

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:52.598
I am an extraterrestrial
from the planet vulcan.

01:02:54.688 --> 01:02:55.848
Marty!

01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:01.266
- Marty! Marty!
- Hey, George, buddy.

01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:03.727
You weren't at school.
What have you been doing all day?

01:03:03.822 --> 01:03:06.734
I overslept. Look, I need your help.

01:03:06.825 --> 01:03:09.441
I have to ask Lorraine out,
but I don't know how to do it.

01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:12.369
All right. Okay, listen, keep your
pants on. She's over in the cafe.

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:14.491
God! How do you...

01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:19.105
What made you change your mind, George?

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:22.041
Last night, Darth Vader came down
from planet vulcan

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:26.045
and told me that if I didn't take
Lorraine out, that he'd melt my brain.

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:29.219
Let's just keep this brain-melting stuff
to ourselves, okay?

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:32.798
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- All right, okay. There she is, George.

01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:34.632
Now just go in there and invite her.

01:03:34.728 --> 01:03:37.470
- Okay. But I don't know what to say.
- Just say anything, George.

01:03:37.564 --> 01:03:41.603
Say whatever's natural,
the first thing that comes into your mind.

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:44.146
Nothing's coming to my mind.

01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:45.997
Jesus, George,
it's a wonder I was even born.

01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:48.568
- What? What?
- Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:53.243
Look, tell her destiny
brought you together.

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:57.164
Tell her that she is the most beautiful
girl you have ever seen in the world.

01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:59.206
Girls like that stuff.

01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:02.506
- What are you doing, George?
- I'm writing this down. This is good stuff.

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:04.037
Yeah. Okay, let's go.

01:04:04.132 --> 01:04:05.588
- Can you take care of that?
- Right.

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:27.022
Lou, give me a milk.

01:04:28.406 --> 01:04:29.771
Chocolate.

01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:51.050
Lorraine. My density has popped me to you.

01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:53.636
What?

01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:54.887
Oh.

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:58.387
What I meant to say was...

01:04:58.478 --> 01:05:01.561
Wait a minute.
Don't I know you from somewhere?

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:03.096
George: Yes.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:07.313
Yes. I'm George. George mcfly.

01:05:07.946 --> 01:05:09.607
I'm your density.

01:05:10.615 --> 01:05:11.900
I mean,

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:14.736
your destiny.

01:05:15.954 --> 01:05:17.034
Oh.

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:19.157
Hey, mcfly.

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:26.498
I thought I told you never to come in here.

01:05:29.008 --> 01:05:31.215
Well, it's going to cost you.

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:33.835
How much money you got on you?

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:36.296
How much do you want, biff?

01:05:44.524 --> 01:05:46.105
All right, punk.

01:05:46.192 --> 01:05:48.934
- Now I'm going to...
- Whoa, whoa, biff. What's that?

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:58.697
That's Calvin klein.
Oh, my god, he's a dream.

01:05:58.872 --> 01:05:59.907
Whoa, whoa.

01:05:59.998 --> 01:06:02.410
- Kid! Kid, stop! Stop!
- Hey!

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:06.891
Marty: I'll get it back to you, all right?

01:06:07.338 --> 01:06:09.044
Boy: You broke it!

01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:10.462
Come back here!

01:06:12.677 --> 01:06:14.417
Wow. Look at him go!

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:17.546
Get him!

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:33.065
To the car! Go! Go!

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:42.157
Girl: What's that thing he's on?
Boy: It's a board with wheels.

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:43.829
He's an absolute dream.

01:06:43.917 --> 01:06:46.750
Thug 1: Come on, come on!
Thug 2: Look out for the car!

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:03.759
Whoa!

01:07:20.078 --> 01:07:21.909
Biff: I'm going to ram him.

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:30.455
All: Shit!

01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:43.131
Ooh!

01:07:55.697 --> 01:07:57.403
Thanks a lot, kid.

01:07:58.533 --> 01:08:00.945
I'm going to get that son of a bitch.

01:08:01.035 --> 01:08:04.027
- Where does he come from?
- Yeah, where does he live?

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:08.331
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.

01:08:14.173 --> 01:08:15.504
Doc on TV: Oh, my god.

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:19.008
They found me.
I don't know how, but they found me.

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:20.756
Run for it, Marty!

01:08:25.475 --> 01:08:26.841
Oh, my god.

01:08:27.645 --> 01:08:30.557
They found me.
I don't know how, but they found me.

01:08:30.648 --> 01:08:32.013
Run for it, Marty!

01:08:33.318 --> 01:08:34.398
Doc?

01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:38.111
Hi, Marty. I didn't hear you come in.

01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:41.609
Fascinating device, this video unit.

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.279
Listen, doc.

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:46.682
You know, there's something
I haven't told you about the night

01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:48.058
- we made that tape.
- Please, Marty, don't tell me.

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:49.435
No man should know too much
about his own destiny.

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:50.894
- You don't understand.
- I do understand.

01:08:50.917 --> 01:08:53.689
If I know too much about my own future,
I can endanger my own existence.

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:56.045
Just as you've endangered yours.

01:08:58.009 --> 01:08:59.920
- You're right.
- Now...

01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:02.877
Let me show you my plan
for sending you home.

01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:04.712
Please excuse the crudity of this model.

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:07.139
I didn't have time to build it to scale
or paint it.

01:09:07.225 --> 01:09:09.136
- It's good.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:09:10.438 --> 01:09:13.930
Okay, now. We run some industrial-strength
electrical cable

01:09:14.024 --> 01:09:15.856
from the top of the clock tower

01:09:15.943 --> 01:09:19.231
down, suspending it over the street
between these two lamp posts.

01:09:19.863 --> 01:09:23.857
Meanwhile, we've outfitted the time vehicle
with this big pole and hook,

01:09:23.951 --> 01:09:26.908
which runs directly into
the flux capacitor.

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:32.493
At the calculated moment,
you start off from down the street,

01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:36.828
driving directly toward the cable,
accelerating to 88 miles per hour.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:40.540
According to the flyer, at precisely
10:04 P.M. this Saturday night,

01:09:40.635 --> 01:09:44.252
lightning will strike the clock tower,
electrifying the cable

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:46.587
just as the connecting hook makes contact

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:50.301
thereby sending 1.21 gigawatts
into the flux capacitor

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:52.848
and sending you back to 1985.

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:56.978
All right, now. Watch this.
You wind up the car and release it.

01:09:58.778 --> 01:10:00.985
I'll simulate the lightning.

01:10:09.288 --> 01:10:10.448
Ready.

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:21.331
Set.

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:27.629
Release.

01:10:46.033 --> 01:10:48.194
You're instilling me
with a lot of confidence, doc.

01:10:48.286 --> 01:10:52.325
Don't worry. I'll take care of the
lightning. You take care of your pop.

01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:56.491
By the way, what happened today?
Did he ask her out?

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:58.827
- I think so.
- What did she say?

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:11.597
It's your mom! She's tracked you down!
Quick! Let's cover the time machine.

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:27.404
Hi, Cal... Marty.

01:11:27.909 --> 01:11:29.319
Mom. Lorraine.

01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:33.077
How did you know I was here?

01:11:33.998 --> 01:11:35.534
I followed you.

01:11:36.334 --> 01:11:41.545
Oh. This is my doc...
My uncle, doc brown.

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:50.383
Marty, this may seem a little forward,

01:11:50.765 --> 01:11:54.974
but I was kind of wondering if you'd ask me

01:11:55.061 --> 01:11:58.895
to the enchantment under the sea dance
on Saturday.

01:12:01.567 --> 01:12:04.775
Wow, you mean...
You mean nobody's asked you?

01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:08.529
No. Not yet.

01:12:10.243 --> 01:12:13.656
- What about George?
- George mcfly?

01:12:16.207 --> 01:12:20.200
He's kind of cute and all, but not...

01:12:21.087 --> 01:12:25.205
Well, I think a man should be strong,

01:12:27.134 --> 01:12:29.375
so he can stand up for himself

01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:32.670
and protect the woman he loves.

01:12:37.395 --> 01:12:38.760
Don't you?

01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:41.353
Yeah.

01:12:41.816 --> 01:12:43.807
I still don't understand.

01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:46.984
How am I supposed to
go to the dance with her

01:12:47.071 --> 01:12:49.813
if she's already going
to the dance with you?

01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:52.569
Well, because, George,
she wants to go with you.

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:54.571
She just doesn't know it yet.

01:12:54.662 --> 01:12:57.699
That's why we got to show her
that you, George mcfly, are a fighter.

01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:59.750
You're somebody
who's gonna stand up for yourself,

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:01.248
somebody who's gonna protect her.

01:13:01.335 --> 01:13:04.543
Yeah, but I've never picked a fight
in my entire life.

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:07.372
Look, you're not going
to be picking a fight, dad.

01:13:07.466 --> 01:13:09.673
Daddy-o.

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.046
You're coming to her rescue, right?

01:13:12.138 --> 01:13:15.130
Okay, let's go over the plan again.
8:55, where are you going to be?

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:16.805
I'm going to be at the dance.

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:20.010
- Right. And where am I going to be?
- You're gonna be in the car with her.

01:13:20.104 --> 01:13:23.062
Right, okay. So, right around 9:00,
she's going to get very angry with me.

01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:25.561
Why is she going to get angry with you?

01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:30.315
Well, because, George, nice girls get angry
when guys take advantage of them.

01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:34.566
You mean you're going to go
touch her on her...

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:37.117
No. No, George, look.

01:13:37.955 --> 01:13:39.911
It's just an act, right?

01:13:40.207 --> 01:13:43.699
Okay. So, 9:00, you're strolling
through the parking lot.

01:13:44.128 --> 01:13:47.336
You see us struggling in the car.

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:50.920
You walk up, you open the door,
and you say...

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:54.293
Your line, George.

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:56.758
Oh!

01:13:57.433 --> 01:14:00.266
Hey, you, get your damn hands off her!

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:05.017
- You really think I ought to swear?
- Yes, definitely.

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:06.722
God damn it, George, swear.

01:14:06.817 --> 01:14:10.025
Okay. So, now you come up.
You punch me in the stomach.

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:11.898
I'm out for the count, right?

01:14:11.989 --> 01:14:15.197
And you and Lorraine
live happily ever after.

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:20.074
You make it sound so easy.
I just... I wish I wasn't so scared.

01:14:20.164 --> 01:14:24.032
George, there's nothing to be scared of.
All it takes is a little self-confidence.

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:28.369
You know, if you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

01:14:31.008 --> 01:14:33.278
Announcer: Hill valley area weather
this Saturday night.

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:36.294
Mostly clear, with some scattered clouds.

01:14:36.389 --> 01:14:38.095
Lows tonight in the upper 40s.

01:14:38.182 --> 01:14:40.093
Are you sure about this storm?

01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:45.099
Since when can weathermen predict
the weather, let alone the future?

01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:48.271
You know, Marty,
I'm going to be very sad to see you go.

01:14:48.359 --> 01:14:51.772
You've really made a difference in my life.
You've given me something to shoot for.

01:14:51.862 --> 01:14:56.026
Just knowing that I'm going to be around
to see 1985.

01:14:56.117 --> 01:14:58.028
That I'm going to succeed in this!

01:14:58.119 --> 01:15:01.657
That I'm going to have a chance
to travel through time!

01:15:07.128 --> 01:15:09.856
It's going to be really hard waiting
30 years before I can talk to you

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:12.838
about everything that's happened
in the past few days.

01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:15.507
I'm really going to miss you, Marty.

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:18.677
I'm really going to miss you.

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.392
- Doc, about the future...
- No!

01:15:26.063 --> 01:15:28.349
Marty! We've already agreed

01:15:28.441 --> 01:15:31.308
that having information about the future
can be extremely dangerous.

01:15:31.402 --> 01:15:34.940
Even if your intentions are good,
it can backfire drastically.

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:40.567
Whatever you've got to tell me, I'll find
out through the natural course of time.

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:43.576
"Dear Dr. brown.

01:15:44.331 --> 01:15:46.788
"On the night that I go back in time,

01:15:47.251 --> 01:15:48.991
"you will be

01:15:49.587 --> 01:15:51.873
"shot by terrorists.

01:15:53.007 --> 01:15:57.967
"Please take whatever precautions are
necessary to prevent this terrible disaster.

01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:01.136
"Your friend,

01:16:02.183 --> 01:16:03.423
"Marty."

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.818
Evening, Dr. brown. What's with the wire?

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:18.817
Oh, just a little weather experiment.

01:16:20.659 --> 01:16:22.741
- What you got under here?
- No! Don't touch that!

01:16:22.828 --> 01:16:25.615
Some new, specialized
weather-sensing equipment.

01:16:25.706 --> 01:16:29.290
- You got a permit for that?
- Of course I do.

01:16:36.717 --> 01:16:39.834
Just a second.
Let me see if I can find it here.

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:36.566
Do you mind if we park for a while?

01:17:37.778 --> 01:17:39.734
That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

01:17:39.822 --> 01:17:40.857
Huh?

01:17:40.948 --> 01:17:45.658
Marty, I'm almost 18 years old.
It's not like I've never parked before.

01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:47.738
What?

01:17:48.289 --> 01:17:51.281
Marty, you seem so nervous.
Is something wrong?

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:52.490
No.

01:17:53.544 --> 01:17:54.659
No.

01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:01.837
Lorraine! Lorraine, what are you doing?

01:18:02.303 --> 01:18:04.635
I swiped it from the old
lady's liquor cabinet.

01:18:04.722 --> 01:18:07.634
Yeah, well, you shouldn't drink.

01:18:07.725 --> 01:18:09.761
- Why not?
- Because you...

01:18:10.561 --> 01:18:13.303
You might regret it later in life.

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:18.269
Marty, don't be such a square.
Everybody who's anybody drinks.

01:18:23.449 --> 01:18:25.280
Jeez, you smoke, 100?

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:29.652
Marty, you're beginning
to sound just like my mother.

01:18:40.883 --> 01:18:43.795
We're going to take a little break,
but we'll be back in a while,

01:18:43.886 --> 01:18:46.468
so don't nobody go nowhere.

01:19:02.863 --> 01:19:06.151
Marty? Why are you so nervous?

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:08.774
Lorraine.

01:19:09.703 --> 01:19:13.867
Have you ever been in a situation

01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:15.744
where you knew
you had to act a certain way,

01:19:15.834 --> 01:19:19.827
but when you got there, you didn't know
if you could go through with it?

01:19:19.922 --> 01:19:23.380
You mean like
how you're supposed to act on a first date?

01:19:23.467 --> 01:19:24.707
Sort of.

01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:28.173
I think I know exactly what you mean.

01:19:29.014 --> 01:19:30.299
You do?

01:19:30.808 --> 01:19:33.424
You know what I do in those situations?

01:19:33.519 --> 01:19:35.760
- What?
- I don't worry.

01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:57.407
This is all wrong. I don't know what it is.

01:19:59.086 --> 01:20:02.544
But when I kiss you, it's like I'm kissing

01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:05.706
my brother.

01:20:06.010 --> 01:20:08.717
I guess that doesn't make any sense,
does it?

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:12.797
Believe me, it makes perfect sense.

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:16.346
Somebody's coming.

01:20:20.274 --> 01:20:24.483
You caused 300 bucks damage to my car,
you son of a bitch.

01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:27.858
And I'm going to take it out of your ass.
Hold him.

01:20:28.782 --> 01:20:31.194
Let him go, biff. You're drunk.

01:20:32.036 --> 01:20:34.493
Well, look-ey what we have here.

01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:40.909
No, no! You're staying right here with me.
Come on, Lorraine.

01:20:41.003 --> 01:20:43.369
- Lorraine: Let me go!
- Leave her alone, you bastard!

01:20:43.464 --> 01:20:45.358
Take him in back, all right?
I'll be right there.

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:48.465
Biff: Just admit that you want it. Come on.

01:20:48.552 --> 01:20:50.838
Well, go on. This ain't no peep show.

01:20:57.603 --> 01:21:00.185
- Hey, let's put him in there.
- Yeah!

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:03.939
That's for messing up my hair.

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:06.108
What the hell are you doing to my car?

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:08.652
Hey, beat it, spook.
This don't concern you.

01:21:11.241 --> 01:21:13.823
Who you calling "spook," peckerwood?

01:21:15.287 --> 01:21:16.948
Hey, hey, listen, guys...

01:21:17.039 --> 01:21:19.621
Look, I don't want to mess
with no reefer addicts, okay?

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:21.539
Get home to your mama, boy.

01:21:21.627 --> 01:21:23.868
Thug 1: Biff!
Thug 2: Hurry, biff!

01:21:24.421 --> 01:21:26.252
Marty: Let me out of here!

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:31.793
- Reginald, where are your keys?
- Marty: The keys are in the trunk.

01:21:32.262 --> 01:21:35.299
- Say that again?
- Marty: I said, the keys are in here.

01:21:49.029 --> 01:21:50.314
Biff: Come on!

01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:55.150
Hey, you, get your damn hands off...

01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:58.277
Oh.

01:21:58.372 --> 01:22:00.988
I think you got the wrong car, mcfly.

01:22:02.292 --> 01:22:04.328
George, help me! Please!

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:07.287
Just turn around, mcfly, and walk away.

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:10.501
- Lorraine: Please, George.
- Are you deaf, mcfly?

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:12.674
Close the door and beat it.

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:18.848
No, biff. You leave her alone.

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:21.387
All right, mcfly.

01:22:24.648 --> 01:22:28.266
You're asking for it,
and now you're going to get it.

01:22:29.695 --> 01:22:31.151
Biff, stop it!

01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:34.438
Biff, you'll break his arm!

01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:37.191
Biff, no!

01:22:38.036 --> 01:22:40.322
Marvin: Give me a hand here, Reginald.

01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:43.951
Damn it, man! I sliced my hand!

01:22:44.042 --> 01:22:45.498
- Whose are these?
- Mine.

01:22:45.586 --> 01:22:47.497
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

01:22:48.839 --> 01:22:50.704
You're going to break his arm!

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:54.500
Biff! Biff, leave him alone!

01:22:54.595 --> 01:22:57.052
Let him go! Let him go!

01:23:30.214 --> 01:23:31.795
Are you okay?

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:55.478
- Who is that guy?
- That's George mcfly.

01:23:59.326 --> 01:24:02.739
- That's George mcfly?
- Excuse me.

01:24:14.007 --> 01:24:15.497
The storm.

01:24:17.469 --> 01:24:20.176
Hey, guys, you gotta get back in there
and finish the dance.

01:24:20.264 --> 01:24:21.674
Hey, man. Look at Marvin's hand.

01:24:21.765 --> 01:24:24.160
He can't play with his hand like that,
and we can't play without him.

01:24:24.184 --> 01:24:26.641
Yeah, well. Look, Marvin, you got to play.

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:28.957
See, that's where they kiss
for the first time on the dance floor.

01:24:28.981 --> 01:24:32.126
And if there's no music, they can't dance.
If they can't dance, they can't kiss.

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:34.516
If they can't kiss,
they can't fall in love and I'm history.

01:24:34.611 --> 01:24:35.771
Hey, man, the dance is over

01:24:35.862 --> 01:24:38.399
unless you know somebody else
that can play the guitar.

01:24:45.789 --> 01:24:48.201
This is for all you lovers out there.

01:24:50.794 --> 01:24:54.833
Marvin: Earth angel, earth angel

01:24:55.591 --> 01:24:58.207
will you be mine?

01:24:58.802 --> 01:25:01.464
My darling dear

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:05.677
- George, aren't you going to kiss me?
- I don't know.

01:25:07.477 --> 01:25:09.593
Scram, mcfly. I'm cutting in.

01:25:16.612 --> 01:25:20.571
Earth angel, earth angel

01:25:21.241 --> 01:25:23.072
the one I adore

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.151
hey, boy, you all right?

01:25:26.288 --> 01:25:27.744
I can't play.

01:25:27.831 --> 01:25:28.911
George!

01:25:46.391 --> 01:25:47.631
George!

01:25:49.061 --> 01:25:50.221
George.

01:25:53.273 --> 01:25:54.683
Excuse me.

01:26:04.117 --> 01:26:06.733
The vision of your happiness

01:26:08.914 --> 01:26:12.122
earth angel, earth angel

01:26:12.793 --> 01:26:16.001
please be mine

01:26:16.588 --> 01:26:18.704
my darling dear

01:26:19.049 --> 01:26:22.086
love you for all time

01:26:22.886 --> 01:26:26.128
I'm just a fool

01:26:27.224 --> 01:26:30.261
a fool in love

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:34.933
with you

01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:45.693
Yeah, man, that was good.
Let's do another one.

01:26:45.784 --> 01:26:47.695
No. I got to go.

01:26:47.786 --> 01:26:51.278
Come on, man.
Let's do something that really cooks.

01:26:51.373 --> 01:26:54.160
Something that cooks.

01:26:59.548 --> 01:27:01.664
- All right.
- Marvin: All right!

01:27:05.679 --> 01:27:07.044
All right.

01:27:07.973 --> 01:27:11.386
All right, this is an oldie, but...

01:27:13.395 --> 01:27:16.762
Well, it's an oldie where I come from.

01:27:21.153 --> 01:27:24.190
Watch me for the changes,
and try and keep up, okay?

01:27:41.131 --> 01:27:43.964
Way down in Louisiana
down in New Orleans

01:27:44.050 --> 01:27:46.792
way back up in the woods
among the evergreens

01:27:46.928 --> 01:27:49.715
there stood a log cabin
made of earth and wood

01:27:49.848 --> 01:27:52.430
where lived a country boy
name of Johnny b. Goode

01:27:52.768 --> 01:27:55.180
he never ever learned
to read or write so well

01:27:55.437 --> 01:27:57.849
he could play the guitar
just like he's ringing a bell

01:27:57.981 --> 01:28:01.940
go, go go, Johnny, go, go

01:28:02.527 --> 01:28:04.518
go, Johnny, go, go, go

01:28:05.405 --> 01:28:06.941
go, Johnny, go, go

01:28:07.032 --> 01:28:09.648
hey, George, I heard you laid out biff.
Nice going.

01:28:09.743 --> 01:28:12.029
George, you ever think
of running for class president?

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.532
Johnny b. Goode

01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:19.537
go, Johnny, go, go

01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:22.290
go, Johnny, go, go, go

01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:25.122
go, Johnny, go, go

01:28:25.217 --> 01:28:27.424
go, Johnny, go, go, go

01:28:29.012 --> 01:28:30.877
Johnny b. Goode

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:35.974
Chuck! Chuck, it's Marvin.

01:28:36.061 --> 01:28:38.643
Your cousin, Marvin Berry.

01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:41.472
You know that new sound
you're looking for?

01:28:41.566 --> 01:28:43.431
Well, listen to this.

01:29:53.013 --> 01:29:55.971
I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet.

01:29:57.309 --> 01:29:58.924
But your kids are going to love it.

01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:04.554
Lorraine.

01:30:04.649 --> 01:30:08.892
Marty, that was very interesting music.
Yeah.

01:30:09.446 --> 01:30:13.030
I hope you don't mind, but George
asked if he could take me home.

01:30:13.283 --> 01:30:17.743
Great! Good. Good, Lorraine.
I had a feeling about you two.

01:30:18.163 --> 01:30:20.119
I have a feeling, too.

01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:21.863
Listen, I got to go,

01:30:21.958 --> 01:30:26.668
but I wanted to tell you
that it's been educational.

01:30:27.714 --> 01:30:30.171
Marty, will we ever see you again?

01:30:31.384 --> 01:30:32.590
I guarantee it.

01:30:32.677 --> 01:30:36.090
Well, Marty, I want to thank you
for all your good advice.

01:30:36.181 --> 01:30:38.513
I'll never forget it.

01:30:39.225 --> 01:30:40.806
Right, George.

01:30:42.187 --> 01:30:45.679
Well, good luck, you guys.

01:30:47.275 --> 01:30:48.355
Oh!

01:30:49.694 --> 01:30:53.607
One other thing. If you
guys ever have kids,

01:30:53.698 --> 01:30:56.110
and one of them, when he's eight years old,

01:30:56.201 --> 01:30:59.193
accidentally sets fire
to the living room rug,

01:31:00.538 --> 01:31:02.153
go easy on him.

01:31:03.166 --> 01:31:04.451
Okay.

01:31:09.339 --> 01:31:12.172
Marty. Such a nice name.

01:31:18.139 --> 01:31:20.255
Damn! Where is that kid?

01:31:23.478 --> 01:31:24.718
Damn!

01:31:27.190 --> 01:31:28.555
Damn! Damn!

01:31:36.408 --> 01:31:39.275
You're late!
Do you have no concept of time?

01:31:39.369 --> 01:31:41.735
Hey, come on. I had to change.

01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:44.742
Do you think I'm going back
in that zoot suit?

01:31:44.833 --> 01:31:47.495
The old man really came through. It worked.

01:31:47.585 --> 01:31:49.667
He laid out biff in one punch.

01:31:49.754 --> 01:31:54.123
I didn't know he had it in him.
He's never stood up to biff in his life.

01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:58.502
- Never?
- No. Why? What's the matter?

01:31:59.597 --> 01:32:03.306
All right! Let's set your destination time.

01:32:08.064 --> 01:32:10.396
This is the exact time you left.

01:32:10.775 --> 01:32:14.233
Let's send you back at
exactly the same time.

01:32:17.115 --> 01:32:19.322
It'll be like you never left.

01:32:21.077 --> 01:32:25.491
Now, I painted a white line
on the street way over there.

01:32:25.582 --> 01:32:27.447
That's where you'll start from.

01:32:27.542 --> 01:32:32.627
I've calculated the precise distance,
taking into account the acceleration speed

01:32:32.714 --> 01:32:37.208
and wind resistance retroactive
from the moment the lightning strikes,

01:32:37.302 --> 01:32:41.796
which will be in exactly
7 minutes and 22 seconds.

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:45.724
- When this alarm goes off, you hit the gas.
- Right.

01:32:52.484 --> 01:32:55.567
Well, I guess that's everything.

01:32:59.783 --> 01:33:02.320
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:09.656
See you in about 30 years.

01:33:11.336 --> 01:33:12.701
I hope so.

01:33:14.339 --> 01:33:15.920
Don't worry!

01:33:16.591 --> 01:33:18.297
As long as you hit that wire

01:33:18.384 --> 01:33:21.467
with the connecting hook
at precisely 88 miles an hour,

01:33:21.554 --> 01:33:24.512
the instant the lightning strikes the tower

01:33:27.018 --> 01:33:29.350
- everything will be fine.
- Right.

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:41.942
- What's the meaning of this?
- You'll find out in 30 years.

01:33:42.033 --> 01:33:44.115
It's about the future, isn't it?

01:33:44.202 --> 01:33:46.944
It's information about the future.
Wait a minute.

01:33:47.038 --> 01:33:51.873
I warned you about this, kid.
The consequences could be disastrous!

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:54.372
Doc, that's a risk
you're going to have to take.

01:33:54.462 --> 01:33:57.295
- Your life depends on it!
- No!

01:33:57.757 --> 01:34:01.090
I refuse to accept the responsibility.

01:34:01.386 --> 01:34:03.377
In that case, I'll tell you straight out.

01:34:08.143 --> 01:34:09.553
Great Scott!

01:34:17.485 --> 01:34:20.522
You get the cable,
I'll throw the rope down to you.

01:34:20.613 --> 01:34:22.399
Right! I got it!

01:34:56.608 --> 01:34:57.848
Doc!

01:35:05.491 --> 01:35:09.780
- Come on, come on. Let's go!
- All right! Take it up!

01:35:13.041 --> 01:35:14.121
Gol

01:35:21.216 --> 01:35:23.252
Doc! “What?

01:35:23.468 --> 01:35:26.801
I have to tell you about the future.

01:35:27.055 --> 01:35:31.424
- What?
- I have to tell you about the future!

01:35:31.517 --> 01:35:32.848
What?

01:35:32.936 --> 01:35:37.771
On the night I go back in time, you get...

01:35:41.277 --> 01:35:42.517
Doc!

01:35:51.788 --> 01:35:52.994
Gol

01:35:53.831 --> 01:35:56.288
- no, doc!
- Look at the time!

01:35:56.376 --> 01:36:00.335
You've got less than four minutes.
Please, hurry!

01:36:11.975 --> 01:36:13.306
Yeah!

01:37:06.529 --> 01:37:09.817
Damn it, doc!
Why did you have to tear up that letter?

01:37:09.907 --> 01:37:11.863
If I only had more time.

01:37:14.871 --> 01:37:17.237
Wait a minute. I got all the time I want.

01:37:17.332 --> 01:37:20.916
I got a time machine.
I can just go back early and warn him.

01:37:21.002 --> 01:37:23.539
Okay. Ten minutes ought to do it.

01:37:25.673 --> 01:37:30.383
Okay. Time circuit's on.
Flux capacitor, fluxing.

01:37:30.845 --> 01:37:32.961
Engine running. All right.

01:37:35.767 --> 01:37:37.758
No. No, no.

01:37:39.312 --> 01:37:41.519
Come on. Not this time. Come on. Come on.

01:38:52.009 --> 01:38:53.294
Marty: Come on.

01:38:55.388 --> 01:38:58.505
Here we go. Here we go. This time. Come on.

01:38:59.809 --> 01:39:02.676
Please. Please. Come on!

01:40:40.993 --> 01:40:42.358
Doc.

01:42:18.549 --> 01:42:20.631
Crazy drunk driver.

01:42:31.145 --> 01:42:32.555
Whoo!

01:42:35.775 --> 01:42:38.016
All right. Red.

01:42:39.528 --> 01:42:42.315
You look great. Everything looks great.

01:42:43.574 --> 01:42:47.567
1:24. I still got time. I'm coming, doc!

01:42:51.248 --> 01:42:55.992
No! No, not again! Come on! Come on!

01:43:09.767 --> 01:43:11.098
Libyans.

01:43:33.749 --> 01:43:34.784
Marty: No!

01:43:36.127 --> 01:43:37.617
You bastard!

01:43:50.975 --> 01:43:52.306
Terrorist: Go!

01:44:26.677 --> 01:44:28.793
Doc! Doc!

01:44:34.268 --> 01:44:36.429
No! No!

01:44:51.368 --> 01:44:52.858
You're alive.

01:45:02.087 --> 01:45:03.702
Bulletproof vest?

01:45:05.049 --> 01:45:06.710
How did you know?

01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:09.922
I never got a chance to tell you.

01:45:23.484 --> 01:45:27.523
What about all that talk
about screwing up future events?

01:45:27.613 --> 01:45:29.695
The space-time continuum?

01:45:30.157 --> 01:45:33.069
Well, I figured, what the hell?

01:45:43.295 --> 01:45:48.335
- So, how far ahead are you going?
- About 30 years. It's a nice, round number.

01:45:48.425 --> 01:45:52.885
Look me up when you get there, all right?
Guess I'll be about 47.

01:45:52.972 --> 01:45:54.212
I will.

01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:57.427
- Take care.
- You, too.

01:45:58.102 --> 01:46:00.434
Right. Bye-bye, einie.

01:46:00.938 --> 01:46:03.930
Oh. And watch that re-entry.
It's a little bumpy.

01:46:04.650 --> 01:46:05.935
You bet.

01:47:10.925 --> 01:47:12.540
What a nightmare.

01:47:23.896 --> 01:47:26.856
Linda: If Paul calls me, tell him I'm
working at the boutique late tonight.

01:47:26.941 --> 01:47:29.085
David: Linda, first of all,
I'm not your answering service,

01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:32.601
second of all, somebody named Greg or
Craig called you just a little while ago.

01:47:32.696 --> 01:47:34.277
Well, which one was it, Greg or Craig?

01:47:34.365 --> 01:47:37.072
I don't know! I can't keep up
with all of your boyfriends.

01:47:37.159 --> 01:47:38.274
Hey.

01:47:39.328 --> 01:47:42.616
- What the hell is this?
- Breakfast.

01:47:43.374 --> 01:47:45.786
David: Did you sleep in your clothes
again last night?

01:47:45.876 --> 01:47:47.207
Yeah. I...

01:47:48.212 --> 01:47:50.749
Yeah. What are you wearing, Dave?

01:47:51.048 --> 01:47:53.881
Marty, I always wear a suit to the office.

01:47:55.594 --> 01:47:57.425
You all right? Yeah.

01:47:58.222 --> 01:47:59.366
Lorraine: I think we need
a rematch, George.

01:47:59.390 --> 01:48:00.425
A rematch?

01:48:00.516 --> 01:48:02.632
- Why? Were you cheating?
- No.

01:48:02.726 --> 01:48:04.591
- Hello.
- Good morning.

01:48:06.689 --> 01:48:08.179
Mom! Dad!

01:48:08.565 --> 01:48:10.210
- Did you hit your head?
- Marty, are you all right?

01:48:10.234 --> 01:48:14.227
You guys look great. Mom, you look so thin.

01:48:14.571 --> 01:48:17.108
Why, thank you, Marty. George!

01:48:18.575 --> 01:48:20.657
Good morning, sleepyhead.

01:48:21.578 --> 01:48:24.411
- Good morning, Dave. Linda.
- David: Good morning, mom.

01:48:24.498 --> 01:48:26.989
Linda: Marty, I almost forgot.
Jennifer Parker called.

01:48:27.084 --> 01:48:30.702
I sure like her, Marty.
She is such a sweet girl.

01:48:31.255 --> 01:48:35.294
- Isn't tonight the night of the big date?
- What? What, ma?

01:48:35.384 --> 01:48:39.502
Aren't you going up to the lake tonight?
You've been planning it for two weeks.

01:48:39.596 --> 01:48:42.258
Mom, we talked about this.
How can I go to the lake?

01:48:42.349 --> 01:48:43.464
The car's wrecked.

01:48:43.559 --> 01:48:45.140
Wrecked? Wrecked?

01:48:45.227 --> 01:48:47.434
- When did this happen? Why wasn't I told?
- Quiet down.

01:48:47.521 --> 01:48:49.011
I'm sure the car is fine.

01:48:49.106 --> 01:48:51.418
David: Why am I always the last one
to know about these things?

01:48:51.442 --> 01:48:54.525
See? There's biff out there
waxing it right now.

01:48:54.945 --> 01:48:59.279
Now, biff, I want to make sure that we get
two coats of wax this time, not just one.

01:48:59.366 --> 01:49:03.609
- I'm just finishing up the second coat now.
- Now, biff, don't con me.

01:49:05.122 --> 01:49:07.158
I'm sorry, Mr. mcfly.

01:49:07.249 --> 01:49:10.332
I meant I was just starting
on the second coat.

01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:15.254
Biff. What a character.
Always trying to get away with something.

01:49:15.758 --> 01:49:18.716
I've had to stay on top of biff
ever since high school.

01:49:18.802 --> 01:49:22.545
Although, if it wasn't for him...
We never would have fallen in love.

01:49:22.639 --> 01:49:24.095
That's right.

01:49:24.641 --> 01:49:27.348
Mr. mcfly! Mr. mcfly, this just arrived.

01:49:27.436 --> 01:49:30.223
Oh, hi, Marty. I think it's your new book.

01:49:32.816 --> 01:49:36.650
Honey! Your first novel.

01:49:36.737 --> 01:49:37.839
George: Like I've always told you,

01:49:37.863 --> 01:49:40.730
you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

01:49:40.824 --> 01:49:45.238
Oh, Marty, here's your keys.
You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

01:49:45.829 --> 01:49:46.989
Keys?

01:50:03.347 --> 01:50:05.884
How about a ride, mister?
Jennifer.

01:50:07.142 --> 01:50:11.260
Oh, are you a sight for sore eyes!
Let me look at you.

01:50:12.022 --> 01:50:14.889
Marty, you're acting like
you haven't seen me in a week.

01:50:14.983 --> 01:50:16.393
I haven't.

01:50:16.985 --> 01:50:20.227
You okay? Is everything all right?

01:50:23.534 --> 01:50:24.649
Marty: Oh, yeah.

01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:28.656
Everything is great.

01:50:42.886 --> 01:50:47.129
Marty! You've got to come back with me!

01:50:47.933 --> 01:50:50.390
- Where?
- Back to the future.

01:50:55.023 --> 01:50:57.139
Wait a minute. What are you doing, doc?

01:50:58.152 --> 01:50:59.232
I need fuel.

01:51:02.698 --> 01:51:05.110
Go ahead. Quick! Get in the car.

01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:07.236
No, no. Doc, I just got here, okay?

01:51:07.327 --> 01:51:09.389
Jennifer's here.
We're gonna take the new truck for a spin.

01:51:09.413 --> 01:51:12.655
Well, bring her along.
This concerns her, too.

01:51:12.749 --> 01:51:14.394
Wait a minute, doc.
What are you talking about?

01:51:14.418 --> 01:51:16.454
What happens to us in the future?

01:51:16.545 --> 01:51:19.503
- Do we become assholes or something?
- No, no, no, no, Marty.

01:51:19.590 --> 01:51:22.878
Both you and Jennifer turn out fine.
It's your kids, Marty.

01:51:22.968 --> 01:51:25.209
Something has got to be done
about your kids.

01:51:31.602 --> 01:51:34.685
Hey, doc, we better back up.
We don't have enough road to get up to 88.

01:51:34.771 --> 01:51:38.935
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.
