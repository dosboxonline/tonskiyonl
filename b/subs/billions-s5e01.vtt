56:57.122 --> 56:58.414
What are we gonna

56:57.122 --> 56:58.414
do about it?

56:58.456 --> 57:01.293
He wants to be friends,

56:58.456 --> 57:01.293
so we'll be friends.

57:01.335 --> 57:03.921
Right up until

57:01.335 --> 57:03.921

57:03.962 --> 57:07.883

57:03.962 --> 57:07.883

57:13.471 --> 57:15.724
Okay.
