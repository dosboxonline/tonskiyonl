00:24.641 --> 00:25.673
Huh.

00:25.768 --> 00:27.008
[Linda]
Tina, let's go.

00:27.028 --> 00:29.102
It's called breakfast,
not break-slow.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.421
Coming. Save me some
Chocolate Chippy Chomps.

00:31.515 --> 00:32.814
Sorry I'm late.

00:32.849 --> 00:34.608
I was dealing with
a little something on my butt

00:34.702 --> 00:37.036
that I'm hoping is totally
normal for a teenage person.

00:37.263 --> 00:38.537
It rhymes with "schmimple."

00:38.688 --> 00:41.615
Dr. Richard Kimble?
Is<i> The Fugitive</i> on your butt?

00:41.767 --> 00:42.875
No. Wait, what?

00:43.026 --> 00:45.602
How is it empty?
Didn't we just get these?

00:45.621 --> 00:47.454
Gene, how many bowls
did you have?

00:47.531 --> 00:48.955
One. It was the most
amount of cereal

00:49.124 --> 00:51.775
a person could fit in a bowl,
but it was just one.

00:51.868 --> 00:54.127
Louise, how many bowls
did you have?

00:54.280 --> 00:55.870
Uh, why are we counting?

00:55.964 --> 00:57.447
Because I said, "Save me some."

00:57.541 --> 00:58.949
"Save me some" means
you don't take a second bowl

00:59.042 --> 01:00.467
before everyone's
had their first.

01:00.619 --> 01:02.953
I couldn't stop myself.
They're just so chocolaty.

01:03.046 --> 01:05.564
I don't understand how they're
legally allowed at breakfast.

01:05.674 --> 01:08.233
Louise. Tina, do you want me
to make you an egg, honey?

01:08.460 --> 01:09.902
Oh, yeah, I'd love a stupid egg.

01:10.053 --> 01:11.144
-[Bob] Tina.
-Sorry. Yes, please.

01:11.238 --> 01:14.798
So, the Bounty of the Bay Parade
is coming up.

01:14.817 --> 01:18.135
That'll be, um, well,
it'll be another parade.

01:18.228 --> 01:19.653
This town loves a parade.

01:19.747 --> 01:20.987
We're a real parade-y bunch.

01:21.140 --> 01:23.140
Hey, doesn't your school
have a float this year?

01:23.233 --> 01:24.658
Yup. Every year they pick
a different school,

01:24.810 --> 01:26.660
and this year
it's Wagstaff's time to shine.

01:26.812 --> 01:28.069
Oh, fun.

01:28.163 --> 01:30.330
We're gonna vote on an
ambassador to ride on the float.

01:30.424 --> 01:33.074
I'd only want to do it if
I could be the "ham-bassador."

01:33.168 --> 01:34.409
-These hams.
-Mm.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.169
Aah! How is your cereal
still so crunchy?!

01:36.322 --> 01:38.380
What'd you say? It's hard
to hear you over the crunch.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.598
Damn it.

01:40.509 --> 01:41.749
[Frond]
Ugh.

01:41.844 --> 01:42.843
You okay, Mr. Frond?

01:42.937 --> 01:44.828
I heard you going "ugh."

01:44.847 --> 01:46.087
-I'm fine.
-Okay, bye.

01:46.107 --> 01:49.015
It's just this email
from Principal Spoors.

01:49.168 --> 01:51.259
I guess he was bragging
to the superintendent

01:51.278 --> 01:53.612
about our advice column
in the school newspaper,

01:53.839 --> 01:55.021
Ask an Eighth Grader.

01:55.174 --> 01:56.598
Our school newspaper
has an advice column?

01:56.692 --> 01:59.100
Well, we did for a while,
but it wasn't very popular.

01:59.194 --> 02:01.769
Maybe because, no offense,
kids don't know anything

02:01.847 --> 02:03.771
-and give terrible advice.
-Okay.

02:03.866 --> 02:06.350
And then, a few years ago, after
the student doing it graduated,

02:06.368 --> 02:09.853
no one found a replacement and
the column just kind of fizzled.

02:09.872 --> 02:11.538
Oh. Well, I should
get going, so--

02:11.690 --> 02:14.358
But now Principal Spoors
wants to resurrect it

02:14.376 --> 02:16.877
because the superintendent said
she was going to "check it out"

02:16.971 --> 02:18.879
and Spoors doesn't want
to look like an idiot.

02:19.031 --> 02:21.974
-All right. See you later.
-And Ms. Persky
is on maternity leave,

02:22.201 --> 02:25.293
so somehow I got to handle
the paper while she's gone.

02:25.387 --> 02:27.053
And that's on top
of having to get kids

02:27.130 --> 02:29.055
to vote for
the parade ambassador.

02:29.208 --> 02:30.374
Uh-huh. Take it easy.

02:30.467 --> 02:32.559
Anyway, Tina, since you're here

02:32.653 --> 02:34.895
and you're an eighth grader,
guess what.

02:35.047 --> 02:36.822
You're the new
Ask an Eighth Grader.

02:37.049 --> 02:37.972
Wait, what, me?

02:37.992 --> 02:39.566
-Yeah, you're welcome.
-Okay.

02:39.643 --> 02:42.644
Um, you really think
I'd be good at giving advice?

02:42.663 --> 02:45.222
Tina, I really, really do...

02:45.240 --> 02:47.240
not care either way. Congrats.

02:47.393 --> 02:49.334
-Um, thanks?
-And you're supposed
to be anonymous,

02:49.486 --> 02:50.485
so don't tell anyone.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.413
Wow, this is, uh,
quite an honor, I--

02:53.565 --> 02:54.822
All right, out you go.
Busy, busy.

02:54.842 --> 02:55.899
-No time to talk.
-Uh, uh, okay, yeah.

02:56.068 --> 02:57.567
-Hey, Teddy.
-Hi, Teddy.

02:57.586 --> 02:59.678
Hi, Linda, Bob.
One Burger of the Day, please.

02:59.905 --> 03:02.739
And, Bobby, can you not
take forever to make the burger,

03:02.758 --> 03:03.924
like you sometimes do?

03:04.018 --> 03:04.850
Uh, okay.

03:05.001 --> 03:06.243
Ooh, he's in a mood.

03:06.503 --> 03:08.836
I-I got to hurry over to help
the Order of the Pioneers

03:08.856 --> 03:10.338
build their float
for the parade.

03:10.357 --> 03:13.099
Ooh, the Order of the Pioneers.
Wait, who are they, again?

03:13.252 --> 03:15.252
They're one of
the oldest fraternal societies

03:15.270 --> 03:17.103
-in the country.
-Oh, did you join?

03:17.198 --> 03:18.864
Join? No, no, no.

03:19.091 --> 03:21.258
I mean, I'd love to be
a Pioneer, but...

03:21.276 --> 03:23.702
you know those groups.
They're so hard to get into.

03:23.779 --> 03:25.595
And they take up a lot of hours.

03:25.614 --> 03:27.539
You spend a lot of hours here.

03:27.691 --> 03:28.707
Yeah, exactly.

03:28.858 --> 03:30.100
-Mm.
-What's the float gonna be?

03:30.193 --> 03:31.693
The Pioneers
commissioned a sculpture

03:31.861 --> 03:34.938
of a giant grouper fish made
out of trash found in the ocean.

03:35.031 --> 03:37.031
Ooh, that's a fun thing
to do with trash.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.550
We just throw ours away.

03:38.702 --> 03:40.110
So, how are you helping them?

03:40.128 --> 03:41.795
Well, I'm building their float
with some plywood,

03:41.947 --> 03:43.447
and I'm gonna help them
mount the grouper onto it.

03:43.465 --> 03:47.041
And I also said I could make the
grouper's eyes and mouth move

03:47.061 --> 03:48.118
and make it blow bubbles.

03:48.136 --> 03:49.228
Can you do all that?

03:49.396 --> 03:51.396
I don't know!
I wanted to impress them.

03:51.548 --> 03:53.548
It's gonna be fine.
Everything's online.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.142
I'll just look up
"giant grouper statue,

03:56.237 --> 03:59.129
make look alive for
fraternal order parade float."

03:59.147 --> 04:00.313
-Perfect.
-Yep.

04:00.466 --> 04:01.406
[Frond]
<i> Attention, everyone.</i>

04:01.633 --> 04:04.392
Lunchtime announcements.
Quiet down.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.819
-Peter, stop slurping.
-[slurps] Huh?

04:05.971 --> 04:08.563
Just another reminder:
many of you still need to vote

04:08.657 --> 04:11.157
on which student will be
our parade ambassador.

04:11.310 --> 04:13.585
All you got to do is write down
the name of a student

04:13.737 --> 04:16.997
on one of these ballots.
Just write down a name.

04:17.149 --> 04:17.998
It's that easy.

04:18.166 --> 04:19.816
And everyone
better write my name.

04:19.985 --> 04:21.426
Because I like
to stand on top of things

04:21.653 --> 04:22.928
and look down at people.

04:23.155 --> 04:24.245
And also the ambassador
gives a speech,

04:24.339 --> 04:26.156
-and everyone loves
to hear me talk.
-What?

04:26.249 --> 04:28.249
Another announcement:
Wagstaff is bringing back

04:28.269 --> 04:30.994
the school paper's advice column
Ask an Eighth Grader.

04:31.087 --> 04:33.921
Now you can anonymously ask
all of your burning questions

04:33.999 --> 04:35.999
to a wise, old eighth grader

04:36.018 --> 04:38.001
who themselves
will be anonymous.

04:38.094 --> 04:40.353
And they are totally qualified
to answer them.

04:40.506 --> 04:42.339
Not as qualified
as a guidance counselor

04:42.357 --> 04:44.449
with years of experience,
but whatever.

04:44.526 --> 04:46.118
Kind of cool about
Ask an Eighth Grader, huh?

04:46.345 --> 04:48.120
-Is it?
-I wonder who it is.

04:48.271 --> 04:50.938
-Are we this desperate
for small talk?
-I was talking to Gene.

04:51.033 --> 04:52.457
I'm still mad at you,
Cereal Swiper.

04:52.684 --> 04:56.353
Okay. Someone's still having
a lot of big feelings.

04:56.371 --> 04:58.797
Hey, you mind closing that
Chippy Chomp hole for a second?

04:58.948 --> 05:00.540
So, I'm gonna
tell you something,

05:00.634 --> 05:02.192
but you can't tell anyone.

05:02.194 --> 05:03.635
I'm Ask an Eighth Grader.

05:03.862 --> 05:04.970
-What?!
-Shh.

05:05.121 --> 05:06.972
-[whispers] What?
-Yeah. I'm kind of excited.

05:07.049 --> 05:08.698
These fingers
are gonna type the responses

05:08.717 --> 05:10.216
that change people's lives.

05:10.369 --> 05:13.145
I bet it'll be a welcome break
from chasing boogers all day.

05:13.296 --> 05:15.147
I bet it will, Gene.

Tina, come have dinner and stop
looking at your Ticky Toks.

05:37.338 --> 05:40.397
[groans] It's been days, and
no one has submitted a question

05:40.415 --> 05:41.748
to Ask an Eighth Grader.
Also, Mom, Dad,

05:41.900 --> 05:43.825
remember, you can't tell anyone
my secret identity.

05:43.919 --> 05:47.087
We know. We heard you the many,
many times you've said that.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.663
-Anyone.
-We promise.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.849
[sighs] I just feel like
I could really help people

05:51.000 --> 05:52.092
if I had the chance, you know?

05:52.244 --> 05:54.001
Aw, Tina.
I'll ask you a question.

05:54.096 --> 05:55.854
Should your dad
finally wash his shirt,

05:55.931 --> 05:57.263
or should he
just keep wearing it

05:57.416 --> 05:58.582
even though
it's covered in stains?

05:58.600 --> 06:01.101
-What? Oh, my God.
-It's like a baby's bib.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.361
An exploding baby.

06:02.512 --> 06:03.770
[Tina]
You should wash it, Dad.

06:03.922 --> 06:05.438
And that's advice
from a professional.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.681
[Louise typing]

06:06.700 --> 06:08.182
[Linda]
Good night, Louise.

06:08.276 --> 06:09.776
What have you got under there?

06:09.928 --> 06:12.445
Oh, just...
my little growing body.

06:12.598 --> 06:15.540
Okay. Well, good night.

06:15.692 --> 06:17.358
-Good night.
-Aha.

06:17.452 --> 06:18.543
What are you doing
with the laptop?

06:18.695 --> 06:19.861
And is that Tina's journal?

06:19.880 --> 06:22.029
[sighs]
I was submitting a question

06:22.124 --> 06:23.607
to Ask an Eighth Grader

06:23.625 --> 06:26.367
so Tina would have at least
one measly letter to answer.

06:26.387 --> 06:27.944
I was kinda hoping
it would make up

06:28.037 --> 06:29.704
for the Chippy Chomps incident.

06:29.798 --> 06:31.281
Oof, the Chippy Chomps incident.

06:31.299 --> 06:32.557
But why Tina's journal?

06:32.709 --> 06:34.041
I needed material.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.452
I'm a youthful,
innocent nine-year-old.

06:35.545 --> 06:37.804
I don't have any
weird puberty drama yet.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.456
But this thing is full of it.

06:39.549 --> 06:42.383
I mean, we should donate this to
the Smithsonian to be studied.

06:42.477 --> 06:43.902
Well, let's see
what you got so far.

06:44.129 --> 06:47.388
"Hi, I'm a teenaged person and
I'm pubing all over the place

06:47.408 --> 06:49.241
"like the ding-dong
puberty bell.

06:49.392 --> 06:51.243
"I've got butt zits, boob hairs,

06:51.394 --> 06:52.969
"so much sweat
in my undercarriage area,

06:52.988 --> 06:55.914
and maybe a little mustache
depending on what light I'm in."

06:56.065 --> 06:58.417
Okay, wow, this needs
a little finesse.

06:58.568 --> 07:00.160
What do you mean?
It seems great to me.

07:00.312 --> 07:01.811
No, move over. I'm coming up.

07:01.905 --> 07:03.588
[grunts]
Come on, scooch, scooch.

07:03.740 --> 07:06.332
I'm trying. I didn't know
grown-ups could climb up here.

07:06.427 --> 07:07.926
Yeah, grown-ups
can come up here.

07:08.077 --> 07:09.761
I'm the one who changes
the sheets on this bed.

07:09.913 --> 07:10.929
It's the hardest thing I do

07:11.080 --> 07:12.656
every two to three
to four weeks.

07:12.674 --> 07:15.249
So, you got to make this kid
seem like a real person.

07:15.418 --> 07:16.843
Like this. "I'm feeling...

07:16.937 --> 07:19.162
a little insecure...
about some stuff."

07:19.181 --> 07:20.588

07:20.607 --> 07:22.682
Lot of typos, but that's okay,
we'll fix those later.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.025
-Shh.
-Sorry.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.339
Morning, everyone.
I'm just gonna check

07:29.357 --> 07:30.615
the Ask an Eighth Grader inbox

07:30.784 --> 07:32.192
-and see that it's still empty.
-That's the spirit.

07:32.344 --> 07:35.011
Oh. Oh, my God, I got a letter.

07:35.030 --> 07:36.437
-Oh, wow.
-Huh.

07:36.531 --> 07:39.015
"Butt acne...
boob hairs... puberty..."

07:39.034 --> 07:40.942
It's from someone named
Miss Am I Normal.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.277
[purrs]
Is there a Mr. Am I Normal?

07:43.371 --> 07:45.112
Wow, I feel like
I really get this person.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.874
I mean, they wrote about stuff
that's kind of, uh,

07:47.968 --> 07:48.967
right up my alley.

07:49.044 --> 07:50.785
Ooh, what a great letter.

07:50.879 --> 07:53.955
I-I mean, I didn't read it,
but I'm sure it's great.

07:54.032 --> 07:55.198
Lin, you okay?

07:55.217 --> 07:57.124
She's happy for Tina.
Show some support, Dad.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.886
Yeah, Dad. Offer up a high five
for once in your life.

08:00.038 --> 08:01.813
-Okay, okay.
-[Tina] Damn straight.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.039
Ow.

08:04.059 --> 08:06.392
I think that should do it.
I'm gonna turn it on.

08:06.487 --> 08:07.560
Ooh, bubbles.

08:07.713 --> 08:08.803
-Look at 'em.
-Pretty.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.213
This thing works great.

08:10.306 --> 08:12.324
Uh, why do you need
to do that in here, again?

08:12.551 --> 08:14.141
I have to test it.
For the float.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.052
Bubbles are gonna come out
of the fish's mouth.

08:16.071 --> 08:19.055
No, I know, but why do you
need to do it here?

08:19.074 --> 08:20.740
Because I-I needed
a second opinion.

08:20.892 --> 08:22.984
Can you picture these
coming out of a fish's mouth?

08:23.003 --> 08:25.578
-Yes.
-Are you saying that because
you want me to turn it off?

08:25.731 --> 08:27.063
-Yes.
-Now or--?

08:27.156 --> 08:28.673
-Uh-huh. Yup.
-'Cause we could also keep it on

08:28.900 --> 08:31.009
and see how long it takes
before it runs out of bubbles.

08:31.086 --> 08:32.085
-No.
-Sure.

08:32.237 --> 08:33.678
-[Bob groans]
-Great.
-Excuse me.

08:33.830 --> 08:35.588
The bubbles are popping
on my food.

08:35.682 --> 08:36.906
-Teddy.
-Fine.

08:36.908 --> 08:38.165
Thank you.

08:38.334 --> 08:40.001
Hey, hi, hello there.

08:40.095 --> 08:41.578
Tammy for Parade Ambassador.

08:41.596 --> 08:44.171
Cast your vote and put
this Tammy on a float.

08:44.266 --> 08:46.173
She's so totally floaty.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.509
Tammy definitely puts
the "ass" in ambassador.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.436
Hey, J-Ju, did you see
Ask an Eighth Grader

08:50.589 --> 08:51.846
in the school paper
this morning?

08:51.865 --> 08:53.423
You read the school paper, Zeke?

08:53.516 --> 08:55.608
Fart yeah. I like to keep up
with current events.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.035
There was this letter
from somebody called

08:57.186 --> 08:59.946
Miss Am I Normal,
and it was like, oh, my God,

09:00.098 --> 09:01.948
this kid just
put it all out there.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.283
So honest, so raw.

09:03.359 --> 09:04.450
And, look,

09:04.545 --> 09:06.770
Ask an Eighth Grader had
a spot-on reply, too.

09:06.788 --> 09:07.862
-Check it out.
-You think?

09:07.956 --> 09:09.363
I-I mean, what-what was it?

09:09.457 --> 09:11.591
"I want you to know
that you're not alone,

09:11.701 --> 09:13.276
and I'm 100% sure..."

09:13.369 --> 09:15.202
[Tina]
<i> ...that someone out there</i>
<i> has the same problems</i>

09:15.297 --> 09:16.946
<i> and the same questions.</i>

09:16.965 --> 09:18.615
<i> And remember, your body</i>

09:18.633 --> 09:20.708

09:20.727 --> 09:21.785
<i> so you might as well enjoy it.</i>

09:21.787 --> 09:23.136
I read it, like, four times.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.729
I put it up in my locker.

09:24.881 --> 09:27.399
Tina, your column's the belle
of the butt zit ball.

09:27.550 --> 09:28.474
Shh. But yeah.

09:28.627 --> 09:29.976
Nothing.
Don't worry about it, Peter.

09:30.128 --> 09:31.961
-Just keep slurping your soup.
-[slurps] Huh?

09:31.980 --> 09:34.631
Not that I want Miss Am I Normal
to have a lot more problems,

09:34.724 --> 09:35.982
but I hope she writes in again.

09:36.134 --> 09:38.159
And I hope she has
a lot more problems.

09:39.562 --> 09:41.304
How many more of these
do we have to write?

09:41.397 --> 09:42.639
I don't know, but less talking,
more typing.

09:42.732 --> 09:44.824
All right, all right,
pass me the journal.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.810
Oof, look at this one.
God bless her.

-Hey, Teddy.

10:04.679 --> 10:05.995
Haven't seen you in a few days.

10:06.014 --> 10:08.331
Yeah, I've been working
on the float nonstop.

10:08.424 --> 10:09.666
I'm having a hard time getting

10:09.684 --> 10:11.258
the grouper's eyes
to move around.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.593
And the mouth to open and close.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.946
And the bubbles to come out
of the mouth.

10:15.098 --> 10:16.448
So, everything
you said you'd do.

10:16.675 --> 10:18.617
Gah! This fish is making
a fool of me!

10:18.768 --> 10:20.360
Aw. Hey, kids, how was school?

10:20.512 --> 10:23.771
Great. Miss Am I Normal is kind
of all anyone can talk about.

10:23.790 --> 10:24.848
-Wow.
-Yup.

10:24.866 --> 10:26.366
Everyone wants to know
who she is.

10:26.534 --> 10:28.685
-Oh, they do?
-And who she's wearing.

10:28.703 --> 10:31.020
-Who's Miss Am I Normal?
-She's someone who submitted

10:31.114 --> 10:32.538
to our school newspaper's
advice column,

10:32.633 --> 10:34.374
and I can't tell you
who writes the advice

10:34.526 --> 10:36.876
in the advice column because
it's a really big secret.

10:37.028 --> 10:38.711
Okay. Is it you?

10:38.864 --> 10:39.879
Yes. Please don't tell anyone.

10:40.031 --> 10:42.474
-I won't. Can I tell Mort?
-Sure.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.476
So, yeah, everyone
is trying to figure out

10:44.552 --> 10:47.646
who Miss Am I Normal is.
Isn't that fun?

10:47.797 --> 10:49.296
But, uh, it's anonymous, right?

10:49.391 --> 10:52.466
There's no way they can ever
find out, right, Tina? Right?

10:52.486 --> 10:53.877
I guess, but kids
are really determined.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.395
They made betting pools
about it.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.656
Someone made T-shirts.
One kid started a podcast.

-Good.

11:03.646 --> 11:04.570
Good.

11:04.739 --> 11:06.739
"Thank you for giving me
such wise advice.

11:06.892 --> 11:09.334
"You solved all my problems.
So, goodbye forever.

to figure out who I am

11:11.654 --> 11:13.171
"because it's
not that interesting.

11:13.322 --> 11:16.582
You'll find out and be like,
'Snoozeville, never mind.'"

11:16.735 --> 11:19.994
Man, Miss Am I Normal's worried
she's gonna be a disappointment.

11:20.088 --> 11:22.588
-I feel that.
-Now I want to know
who she is even more.

11:22.741 --> 11:24.182
It's a delicious mystery.

11:24.333 --> 11:26.426
-Damn it.
-How was the reply
from Ask an Eighth Grader?

11:26.578 --> 11:29.078
-Just curious.
-It was great. They wrote,

11:29.172 --> 11:30.855
"I don't know about Snoozeville,

11:31.041 --> 11:33.174
"but I've enjoyed

Aw, man, I'm gonna miss
that correspondence.

11:46.264 --> 11:48.189
-Me, too.
-[Frond] Attention.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.708
I have a very
important announcement.

11:49.784 --> 11:54.270
Through sheer grit and nagging,
I got most of you to vote,

11:54.289 --> 11:56.197
and all the ballots
have been counted

11:56.216 --> 11:58.032
by the political science club...

11:58.126 --> 11:59.459
who also gave me guff...

11:59.611 --> 12:02.554
and we have a winner
for the parade ambassadorship.

12:02.781 --> 12:04.222
And the winner is...

12:04.373 --> 12:07.116
Miss Am I Normal. Really?

12:07.135 --> 12:09.135
-[gasps]
-Oh, my God.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.470
Hell yeah. I voted for her.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.638
Mostly 'cause I wanted
to find out who she is.

12:12.791 --> 12:15.625
-I admire her so much.
-She's got to come forward now.

12:15.643 --> 12:17.736
I'm kinda excited to see
who I've been talking to.

12:17.963 --> 12:21.573
Ugh. Tina, I have
to tell you something.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.390
There is no Miss Am I Normal.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.392
Not yet. She must be too nervous
to reveal herself.

12:25.561 --> 12:29.396
No, I mean Mom and I
wrote those letters.

12:29.491 --> 12:31.899
-Wait, what?
-My mom? Linda Belcher?

12:31.918 --> 12:34.902
[clears throat]
Hi, everyone. Um...

12:34.921 --> 12:37.647
It's me. I am Miss Am I Normal.

12:37.740 --> 12:38.648
[all gasping]

12:38.741 --> 12:40.650
-What?
-Yeah, what?

12:40.668 --> 12:41.760
Tammy's Miss Am I Normal?

12:41.911 --> 12:44.012
What the heck-a-do, what, huh?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.826
[Tina]
You're telling me
that you and Mom

12:49.844 --> 12:51.418
wrote the letters and that
there's no Miss Am I Normal?

12:51.513 --> 12:54.255
-Yeah...
-So y-you just
made all that stuff up?

12:54.349 --> 12:57.424
No, we... took stuff
from your journal.

12:57.502 --> 12:58.184
-Oh.
-What?!

12:58.336 --> 12:59.352
Well, no one was writing in.

12:59.504 --> 13:01.780
-Ugh. So Tammy's lying?
-Yes.

13:02.007 --> 13:03.097
I mean, is that surprising?

13:03.174 --> 13:05.784
-This is unbelievable.
-I'm really sorry.

13:05.935 --> 13:07.176
Ugh!

13:07.195 --> 13:08.361
She'll get over it.

13:08.513 --> 13:09.662
-Ah!
-See?

13:09.848 --> 13:11.014
I can't believe it's you, girl.

13:11.107 --> 13:13.107
Man, my brain's going
like doi-oi-oi-oi-oing.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.442
Yeah, I never would've
guessed it was you, Tammy.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.702
Not in a zillion years.

13:16.855 --> 13:18.797
Yeah, I didn't want to say
anything, but then,

13:18.948 --> 13:21.782
when I got voted ambassador,
I felt like I had to, you know?

13:21.802 --> 13:24.952
Tammy, why didn't you tell me
you were Miss Am I Normal?

13:24.971 --> 13:27.046
I thought we told each other
everything.

13:27.215 --> 13:30.049
Jocelyn, this was, like,
so deeply personal.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.810
Listen, you're still
my best friend,

13:31.961 --> 13:33.219
even though now
all of these people

13:33.371 --> 13:35.538
-also want to be my best friend.
-Okay.

13:35.557 --> 13:37.315
Ow. Stop pushing me.

13:37.466 --> 13:40.043
-[phone rings]
-Bob's Burgers.

13:40.136 --> 13:41.210
-Bob.
-Uh, hey, Teddy.

13:41.229 --> 13:42.211
-It's Teddy.
-Yup.

13:42.230 --> 13:43.229
I can't talk long.

13:43.381 --> 13:45.139
Okay. Well, uh, that's fine.

13:45.233 --> 13:47.567
I'm in the bathroom
at the Pioneers' Lodge.

13:47.661 --> 13:50.053
-Oh... okay.
-The lodge is incredible, Bob.

13:50.055 --> 13:51.663
It's everything you imagined
and more.

13:51.890 --> 13:54.073
Well, I've never imagined
it at all, Teddy.

13:54.225 --> 13:57.335
There's a bar and a pool table,
books and rugs.

13:57.486 --> 13:59.170
I had a couple of beers.
They were so cold.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.080
But, Teddy, I thought
you couldn't talk long.

14:01.249 --> 14:02.565
It's just this grouper float.

14:02.567 --> 14:04.491
I can't tell you
how much I want it to work.

14:04.569 --> 14:06.736
The Pioneers
are excited about it, too.

14:06.754 --> 14:07.995
That's why they invited me over.

14:08.164 --> 14:10.348
I hate to say
I also can't talk long,

14:10.425 --> 14:12.166
but I feel like one of us should

14:12.185 --> 14:13.576
put more pressure
on this conversation.

14:13.669 --> 14:15.370
I told them
the grouper's coming along,

14:15.430 --> 14:16.929
but it's got issues, Bob.

14:17.082 --> 14:19.006
I may have bit off
more than I can chew.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.174
This grouper's a mess.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.417
I'm sure it will be fine, Teddy.

14:21.436 --> 14:23.469
Oh, God, I want to be
a Pioneer so bad.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.438
The paneling in here, Bob.
Real wood.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.939
-Okay, I'm gonna hang up now.
-All right.

14:27.092 --> 14:28.682
I'll call you in ten minutes
from the--

14:28.702 --> 14:31.094
-Tammy?
-Tina, no, I can't
talk right now.

14:31.112 --> 14:33.112
I have to pick up my
ambassador sash from the office

14:33.264 --> 14:35.356
and then I've got an interview
on some kid's podcast.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.116
He wants me to wear the sash
for the podcast.

14:37.268 --> 14:39.360
And you won't be able to see it,
but I can swish it around.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.770
You're not Miss Am I Normal.

14:40.788 --> 14:42.029
[gasps]
How do you know that?

14:42.123 --> 14:43.122
I mean, how dare you?

14:43.274 --> 14:44.624
Yes, I am Miss Am I Normal.

14:44.776 --> 14:47.126
I know you're not, because
I'm Ask an Eighth Grader.

14:47.278 --> 14:49.387
-[gasps]
-Miss Am I Normal's
my mom and my sister.

14:49.538 --> 14:51.114
They wrote the letters
without telling me

14:51.132 --> 14:52.615
because no one was writing
into Ask an Eighth Grader

14:52.634 --> 14:54.559
-and they felt bad for me.
-Um...

14:54.786 --> 14:56.227
Tina, you can't tell anyone

14:56.304 --> 14:58.304
Miss Am I Normal
was your mom and sister.

14:58.456 --> 15:00.732
-Why not? Yes, I can.
-No, you can't.

15:00.883 --> 15:03.384
And not just because
it's so embarrassing for you.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.961
But because if people find out

15:04.979 --> 15:06.220
that Miss Am I Normal
isn't even real,

15:06.239 --> 15:08.798
they're gonna be
super mad and duper sad.

15:08.816 --> 15:11.467
-But--
-So don't tell anyone
that I'm not Miss Am I Normal,

15:11.560 --> 15:13.411
and I won't tell anyone
about your sneaky mom

15:13.638 --> 15:15.246
and your liar sister.
Got it? Good.

15:15.473 --> 15:16.973
-[sighs]
-Good talk. Okay.

15:17.066 --> 15:18.899
Oh, wow.
Aw, thank you so much for that.

15:18.993 --> 15:20.810
Wow. So much support.
Thank you. Thank you.

15:20.828 --> 15:23.630
[groans]

15:24.925 --> 15:26.482
[Teddy]
This is your moment, pal.

15:26.501 --> 15:28.676
Let there be life!

15:29.654 --> 15:31.671
Ha-ha!

15:31.765 --> 15:33.580
Wow.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.508
No. No, no.

15:35.660 --> 15:36.935
No, no, no, no, no, no!

15:37.086 --> 15:39.771
Hello. Hi.
Beautiful day for a parade.

15:39.922 --> 15:41.164
Everything's going
great with this guy.

15:41.166 --> 15:43.166
[laughs, groans]

15:43.259 --> 15:46.185
Ooh, Tina, octopus.

15:46.337 --> 15:47.779
Look at the suckers
on that sucker.

15:47.930 --> 15:49.596
You're still not talking
to me, huh?

15:49.691 --> 15:50.931
No. Not you or Louise.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.766
Except to tell you
I'm not talking to you.

15:52.860 --> 15:54.435
And I'm done.
Back to not talking.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.436
Yup, yup.

15:55.530 --> 15:57.346
Oh, God.
She's still so mad at us.

15:57.440 --> 15:59.106
Us? I'm not part of this, Lin.

15:59.275 --> 16:01.367
I was always against
everything you were doing.

16:01.519 --> 16:03.186
And I'm really glad
to be exactly right.

16:03.204 --> 16:06.038
[sighs] Well, I'm still
going to enjoy the parade.

16:06.191 --> 16:07.356
Right. If it ends soon.

16:07.450 --> 16:08.708
Because we got to open
the restaurant

16:08.802 --> 16:10.468
-and work there.
-[Gene] Nerd.

16:10.545 --> 16:14.288
Give it up for the Women 65
and Older Community Brass Band.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.641
Also known
as the Brassy Biddies.

16:16.792 --> 16:18.643
That's my mom on sousaphone.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.961
Play that funky music, Mom.

16:20.981 --> 16:24.056
And here comes
the Wagstaff School float,

16:24.133 --> 16:26.150
which appears to be
a whaling ship.

16:26.343 --> 16:29.136
So cute, so frowned upon
in modern times.

16:29.230 --> 16:33.549
And riding on top is
Parade Ambassador Tammy Larson.

16:33.568 --> 16:36.402
Tammy also goes by the name
of Miss Am I Normal.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.645
Apparently, she wrote
into the school newspaper

16:38.723 --> 16:42.391
with a whole bunch of intense,
puberty-related issues

16:42.410 --> 16:43.835
-and now she's here.
-Ugh.

16:44.062 --> 16:46.004
-Yay.
-[Tammy] Hi. Hello.

16:46.231 --> 16:49.398
So, Tammy, people really
responded to your letters.

16:49.417 --> 16:51.567
Your refreshing honesty about...

16:51.660 --> 16:55.404
your acne and...
hairs everywhere.

16:55.498 --> 16:58.424
Um, a lot of interesting stuff
is why you

16:58.576 --> 17:01.519
are Wagstaff School
Parade Ambassador.

17:01.670 --> 17:03.521
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:03.672 --> 17:04.914
[chuckles]
So, yes.

17:04.932 --> 17:06.599
But just to set
the record straight,

17:06.751 --> 17:09.193
I don't have acne.
Uh, definitely not on my butt.

17:09.345 --> 17:10.936
Uh, that's gross.
[awkward chuckle]

17:11.031 --> 17:12.421
I don't have
any of that gross stuff.

17:12.440 --> 17:14.590
And it turns out
my mirror was weird.

17:14.609 --> 17:16.016
And I got a new one.

17:16.110 --> 17:18.369
Uh, so, yeah,
I am Miss Am I Normal,

17:18.596 --> 17:20.596
but I'm, like,
Miss Totally Normal.

17:20.615 --> 17:21.873
And... okay? Um, better.

17:22.024 --> 17:23.783
Better than normal.
Better than normal.

17:23.935 --> 17:25.209
-Huh?
-What the...?

17:25.361 --> 17:27.378
-Did she say acne is gross?
-Yeah.

17:27.530 --> 17:29.380
All that vulnerability
was nothing?

17:29.532 --> 17:31.607
I guess I'm ashamed
of my body again.

17:31.626 --> 17:34.277
No, Zeke, it's good.

17:34.295 --> 17:35.053
Oh, no.

17:35.204 --> 17:37.037
Anyway... [clears throat] Hello.

17:37.131 --> 17:39.039
I am your parade ambassador.

17:39.133 --> 17:42.468
Future entrepreneur/model/
producer Tammy Larson.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.379
Who wants to see my
hands-in-pocket? Here it is.

17:45.548 --> 17:47.957
Who wants to see my peace sign,
tongue out? Nyah.

17:48.050 --> 17:51.235
And sassy hip pop.
Head tilt. Elegant hand.

17:51.462 --> 17:52.478
Uh-huh, okay.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.480
No, hold on,
ten more poses at least.

17:54.632 --> 17:57.158
This is the
Whose Monkey Is This? Ooh.

18:01.230 --> 18:04.731
-Mm? This is the... ooh!
-Oh, God. Everyone's sad.

18:04.809 --> 18:06.142
I got to do something.

18:06.277 --> 18:07.476
Uh, excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

18:07.495 --> 18:09.736
So, in conclusion,
best parade ever.

18:09.831 --> 18:11.497
Best ambassador ever.

18:11.649 --> 18:13.983
-I don't have zits on my butt.
-Uh...

18:14.001 --> 18:15.501
-Um, hi.
-Oh.

18:15.653 --> 18:18.245
-I'm Tina. Belcher.
-Tina. [nervous laugh]

18:18.323 --> 18:19.597
What are you doing?

18:19.748 --> 18:21.841
Um, I'm about to breach
all sorts of security

18:21.935 --> 18:25.161
by revealing
this confidential information,

18:25.254 --> 18:27.346
but, um,
I'm Ask an Eighth Grader.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.166
-[gasping]
-I had no idea.

18:30.259 --> 18:31.609
Tina's Ask an Eighth Grader?

18:31.760 --> 18:33.611
Dang. Layers and layers
to that girl.

18:33.762 --> 18:36.172
What's going on?
Did I miss the Brassy Biddies?

18:36.190 --> 18:40.509
Anyway, uh, I wanted to say
there<i> is</i> no Miss Am I Normal.

18:40.528 --> 18:43.696
[laughing nervously]
What? What?!

18:43.848 --> 18:44.847
The letters were fake.

18:44.866 --> 18:47.491
-[gasping]
-Oh, my God.

18:47.644 --> 18:49.443
I know.
I mean, the letters were fake,

18:49.462 --> 18:52.371
but the problems are real.
Like, very, very real.

18:52.523 --> 18:54.132
I don't want to get graphic,
but trust me.

18:54.359 --> 18:57.468
But hopefully they made us all
feel less alone and less gross?

18:57.620 --> 19:00.045
-It was all fake?
-What?
-[overlapping murmuring]

19:00.122 --> 19:02.214
-The letters were fake?
-That's crazy.
-The letters were fake?

19:02.367 --> 19:05.143
I told everyone Ask an Eighth
Grader was a bad idea.

19:05.294 --> 19:06.811
Uh, I didn't know.
I thought I...

19:06.962 --> 19:08.871
-I-I thought that...
-Oh, God.

19:08.890 --> 19:10.297
I just wanted to help.
I-I swear.

19:10.466 --> 19:12.984
Hey, guys, don't blame Tina.

19:13.135 --> 19:15.135
I'm Miss Am I Normal.

19:15.229 --> 19:17.655
Me, too. I'm Miss Am I Normal.

19:17.806 --> 19:18.972
I'm Miss Am I Normal.

19:19.066 --> 19:21.192
-Wait, what?
-I'm Miss Am I Normal, too.

19:21.344 --> 19:22.401
Okay.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.404
-I'm Miss Am I Normal!
-I'm Miss Am I Normal.

19:25.556 --> 19:27.832
-I'm Miss Am I Normal.
-I'm Miss Am I Normal.

19:28.059 --> 19:29.909
[all]
I'm Miss Am I Normal.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.577
I'm Miss Am I Normal.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.229
Why is everybody saying that?

19:33.247 --> 19:36.248
[clears throat]
I'm Miss Am I Normal, too.

19:36.375 --> 19:38.325
No, you're not.
You're definitely not.

19:38.344 --> 19:42.071
And I'm Miss Let's Keep
This Parade Going.

19:42.164 --> 19:44.407
-[Tammy straining]
-Up next we've got the float

19:44.425 --> 19:47.518
from the local chapter
of the Order of Pioneers.

19:47.745 --> 19:50.429
Looks like... [chuckles]
some kind of wacky fish

19:50.523 --> 19:52.023
made out of trash.

19:52.174 --> 19:54.433
Oh, it's Teddy's float.
It looks great.

19:54.602 --> 19:56.194
[Teddy grunting]

19:56.362 --> 19:58.270
[Bob]
Is Teddy inside the fish?

19:58.423 --> 19:59.605
Oh, my God, I think he is.

19:59.757 --> 20:01.532
I don't think that
was his plan, was it?

20:01.684 --> 20:02.608
Did it eat him?

20:02.760 --> 20:04.351
[grunting]

20:04.370 --> 20:07.354
[Louise]
Hey, Teddy. If you're all right,
give us a wink.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.522
[Teddy grunting]

20:08.616 --> 20:09.782
He's fine.

20:09.934 --> 20:11.242
Tina, I'm so proud of you.

20:11.394 --> 20:13.953
You made a lot of kids
feel better about themselves.

20:14.105 --> 20:15.287
And I really am sorry.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.273
-Mom isn't, but I am.
-Hey.

20:17.333 --> 20:20.459
But also, maybe take some of
that teen stuff advice yourself

20:20.628 --> 20:23.387
because it turns out you were
pretty good at giving it.

20:23.614 --> 20:26.057
So you're welcome
for that big revelation.

20:26.208 --> 20:27.874
I accept your apology
that turned into

20:27.969 --> 20:29.635
-patting yourself on the back.
-Oh, good.

20:29.729 --> 20:30.970
When's the next parade, right?

20:31.122 --> 20:32.879
-Oh, tomorrow.
-[phone buzzes]

20:32.899 --> 20:34.807
Teddy's calling. Hi, Teddy.

20:34.959 --> 20:37.126
Hey, uh, nice job
with the grouper.

20:37.144 --> 20:38.903
[Teddy]
<i> Bob, I got a situation here.</i>

20:39.054 --> 20:41.647
<i>Good news is, I'm a probationary</i>
<i> member of the Pioneers.</i>

20:41.799 --> 20:44.057
<i> The bad news is,</i>
<i> there's some very unsettling</i>

20:44.151 --> 20:45.559
<i> initiation stuff going on.</i>

20:45.653 --> 20:47.636
<i> You know I'm not comfortable</i>
<i> with knives or heights,</i>

20:47.655 --> 20:49.080
<i> and this is both.</i>

20:49.231 --> 20:51.398
<i> -I might need you</i>
<i> to come get me.</i>
-Oh, my God.

20:51.417 --> 20:54.810
<i> And I need you to bring me</i>
<i> a bathrobe and some gauze.</i>
