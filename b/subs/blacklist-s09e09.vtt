[tense music playing]

00:02.210 --> 00:03.169
[exhales]

00:06.214 --> 00:07.424
I can't do it.

00:08.967 --> 00:10.135
That's all right.

00:11.386 --> 00:12.512
I don't want to.

00:14.014 --> 00:14.889
I understand.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.105
[gunshot]

00:25.817 --> 00:28.278
No. No!

00:40.749 --> 00:42.167
Raymond, we have to go.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.881
Raymond, we must. I'm sorry.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.434
[engine revs]

01:00.602 --> 01:02.604
[suspenseful music playing]

01:09.235 --> 01:10.445
[Dembe] We have company.

01:11.404 --> 01:12.489
It's Ressler.

01:15.950 --> 01:16.910
Lose him.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.538
[horn honks]

01:23.374 --> 01:25.084
[Cooper over phone]
<i>I know what you wanna do.</i>

01:25.168 --> 01:26.753
<i>But killing him will only make it worse.</i>

01:26.836 --> 01:30.089
<i>Donald, listen to me.</i>
<i>You're in no condition to drive.</i>

01:32.008 --> 01:33.510
[horn honks]

01:33.593 --> 01:34.552
<i>Don't do this.</i>

[somber music playing]

[exhales]

02:32.610 --> 02:33.444
Raymond?

02:36.030 --> 02:37.115
Raymond?

02:38.575 --> 02:40.368
[suspenseful music playing]

02:40.451 --> 02:41.327
Raymond.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.705
[sighs]

[clicking]

02:55.842 --> 02:57.844
[door slides open]

03:02.515 --> 03:04.392
I'm being evaluated.

03:05.184 --> 03:07.687
Not on your floricultural skills, I hope.

03:07.770 --> 03:08.980
[chuckles]

03:09.063 --> 03:10.481
My mental state.

03:10.565 --> 03:13.067
Weecha's sister, Mierce, is a shaman.

03:13.151 --> 03:17.363
She reads the flowers
for insight into my mood.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.825
I see dried out and dark.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.869
Bad blood and betrayal.

03:22.952 --> 03:25.914
Is this still about Dembe joining the FBI?

03:25.997 --> 03:29.542
Because that wasn't about betrayal.
It was about upward mobility.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.669
What happened to Elizabeth,

03:32.295 --> 03:35.882
Dembe shares a significant
responsibility for that.

03:35.965 --> 03:38.676
What are you talking about?

03:39.844 --> 03:41.429
Townsend is responsible.

03:41.512 --> 03:44.224
He sent VanDyke,
VanDyke pulled the trigger.

03:45.767 --> 03:49.437
-I thought you were with the sister.
-I am. Weecha and I are roommates.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.649
The bed is much more comfortable
than the couch.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.817
I being a gentleman,
I offered her the bed.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.528
She being a lady,
she invited me to join her.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.572
Marvin, you said you had news.

03:59.656 --> 04:04.911
Let's hope it's decidedly less dry
and considerably more light.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.789
[foreboding music playing]

04:07.872 --> 04:10.416
Hess. Ray. Colby.

04:10.500 --> 04:15.380
Tuesday. Wednesday. Thursday.
Three days. Three hits.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.382
No who. No why.

04:17.465 --> 04:21.219
Only the what. Which is a disaster.

04:21.928 --> 04:25.765
The only thing worse is the fact
that I'm the first one telling you this.

04:26.349 --> 04:29.936
Hess was hit on Tuesday.
How could this possibly be news to you?

04:30.520 --> 04:34.732
You're out of touch. You need
to get your ducks in a row, Raymond.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.110
[Agnes] <i>Pinky!</i>

04:38.278 --> 04:41.948
Oh, my goodness. Aren't you a bundle
of energy this morning.

04:42.031 --> 04:44.701
I've got orchestra practice before school,

04:44.784 --> 04:47.078
then a math quiz
and an English presentation.

04:47.161 --> 04:49.372
Then I'm trying out for the play,

04:49.455 --> 04:51.791
and then you're reading me
some <i>Pippi Longstocking.</i>

04:51.874 --> 04:53.459
You're weeks behind on that.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.670
-[horn honks]
-[sighs] That's Sadie.

04:55.753 --> 04:58.006
Total frenemy. Gotta go.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.466
Hi, Weecha. Bye!

05:01.050 --> 05:04.178
[chuckles] I'd like to think
I had that much energy once.

05:04.262 --> 05:07.307
If I did, it's depressing
to think about where it all went.

05:07.390 --> 05:11.519
Perhaps this will give you a jolt.
It seems I'm under attack.

05:11.602 --> 05:17.025
In the past week, a strike team has taken
out three key members of my organization.

05:17.108 --> 05:18.401
-Sorry.
-[Raymond] Thank you.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.862
-I'm not here for your sympathy.
-[Cooper] Good.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.780
Because officially you don't have it.

05:22.864 --> 05:26.200
The bureau would be thrilled
to know the organization is under siege.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.494
I guess you're not here
for my official response.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.998
As a rule, I police my own business.
In this case, I need help.

05:32.081 --> 05:35.376
If you want the Blacklist to continue,
you'll give it.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.629
-It's that bad?
-The attacks were surgical and strategic,

05:38.713 --> 05:41.799
requiring an insightful knowledge
of my organization.

05:41.883 --> 05:46.012
And I don't really know from
which direction this assault is coming.

05:46.095 --> 05:49.599
And there's one more thing.
Dembe. I won't work with him.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.226
-Why?
-All that matters is that I won't.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.437
-He'll have to be replaced.
-[Cooper] I won't do that.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.648
-Not without knowing why.
-Ask him. He's honest.

05:57.732 --> 06:01.194
Who knows, after he tells you,
you may not wanna work with him either.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.614
[keyboard clicking]

06:18.711 --> 06:19.879
[Cooper] Reddington's worried.

06:19.962 --> 06:23.466
His organization's under attack,
and he wants our help.

06:23.549 --> 06:28.679
He doesn't have a name or a motive.
Only this: three victims in three days.

06:28.763 --> 06:32.391
-[Ressler] Who are they?
-Ricki Hess. Jack Ray. Budge Colby.

06:32.475 --> 06:35.937
-Friends of yours?
-They were once. Good people.

06:36.020 --> 06:38.189
-What did they do?
-[Dembe] Operations.

06:38.272 --> 06:41.859
Each was responsible for a different port.
New Jersey. Norfolk. Miami.

06:41.943 --> 06:45.780
-Top people. Well protected.
-And yet someone got to all three.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.323
No wonder Reddington's worried.

06:47.406 --> 06:51.327
I've asked our field offices
to forward us the crime-scene information.

06:51.410 --> 06:53.913
If there's a clue, we need to find it.

06:53.996 --> 06:56.499
-We already have a clue.
-You know who did this?

06:56.582 --> 06:58.251
No. Just what they're going to do next.

06:58.334 --> 07:00.586
How happy is Reddington
that you're on the task force?

07:00.670 --> 07:01.712
[Cooper] Not very.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.715
-In fact, he wants me to kick you off it.
-What? Why would he want that?

07:04.799 --> 07:06.342
He said I should ask you.

07:06.425 --> 07:11.389
VanDyke. If I was doing my job
even a little bit that day, that night,

07:11.472 --> 07:14.183
I would've seen him
long before he shot Elizabeth.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.227
I could've stopped him.

07:17.061 --> 07:18.855
And Reddington blames you.

07:18.938 --> 07:22.358
-No more than I blame myself.
-[Ressler] You shouldn't. I don't.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.985
Believe me, I've tried.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.487
Raymond has VanDyke's phone.

07:26.571 --> 07:30.658
He had someone pull the GPS data points
from the day Elizabeth was killed.

07:30.741 --> 07:33.828
I met Elizabeth at a diner
hours before she was shot.

07:33.911 --> 07:39.375
The GPS data and photos on the phone
show that VanDyke was watching us.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.752
If I was paying attention,
I would've noticed him.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.296
How did he know you'd be there?

07:43.379 --> 07:45.423
I assume he was following me,
but I'm not sure.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.550
Which is why
I had the phone data sent to me.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.136
I hope that by tracking it, I'll find out.

07:50.219 --> 07:52.805
I could use your help
plotting the data points.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.599
-Of course.
-So, what's the clue?

07:55.475 --> 07:58.561
-I thought I was being kicked off.
-That's my call, not Red's.

07:58.644 --> 08:01.647
He thought I'd agree with him
once you explained yourself.

08:01.731 --> 08:05.318
You have and I don't.
So the clue, let's hear it.

08:08.571 --> 08:11.699
This is a macro look
at Raymond's operations in the Atlantic.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.618
Does he have that many in the Pacific?

08:13.701 --> 08:15.745
And the Indian,
Baltic and the Mediterranean.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.705
-Nothing in the Arctic?
-[Dembe] No.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.957
Other than a compound
on the Faroe Islands.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.626
It's official. Our lives suck.

08:21.709 --> 08:25.546
[Dembe] For shipping in the Atlantic,
he uses accounts in Hamburg, Belfast

08:25.630 --> 08:26.589
and the Caymans.

08:26.672 --> 08:29.091
The funds are routed
through Hawala to Morocco.

08:29.175 --> 08:32.136
He then ships
from Gibraltar, Benin or Dakar.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.471
You know everything.

08:33.554 --> 08:36.140
I guess I assumed you did,
but you actually do.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.558
[Dembe] I didn't always.

08:37.642 --> 08:42.021
Everything with Raymond is need-to-know.
But after Elizabeth, he couldn't function.

08:42.730 --> 08:45.191
-So I had to function for him.
-You took over?

08:45.274 --> 08:47.568
-I did.
-[Aram] What was that like?

08:47.652 --> 08:50.238
Going from the man in front of the man
to the man behind him?

08:50.321 --> 08:52.532
[tense music playing]

09:02.250 --> 09:04.460
[brakes screeching]

09:08.130 --> 09:09.423
Down!

09:10.299 --> 09:11.759
[gunfire]

09:21.727 --> 09:22.853
A nightmare.

09:22.937 --> 09:25.106
So Benin, Dakar, Gibraltar.

09:25.189 --> 09:28.609
Goods ship from there
to New Jersey, Norfolk, Miami.

09:28.693 --> 09:31.862
Raymond is a middleman.
He has clients. They have goods.

09:31.946 --> 09:35.366
If the port is choked off
and they can't take delivery,

09:35.449 --> 09:37.410
that costs money
which Raymond has to cover.

09:37.493 --> 09:40.288
This is all educational,
but where's the clue?

09:41.372 --> 09:42.248
Right here.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.667
The Port of Baltimore.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.752
[ship horn blaring]

09:48.504 --> 09:50.256
[rustling nearby]

09:50.339 --> 09:52.049
That you, Joe?

09:52.133 --> 09:55.761
I know, I know, no smoking on sites.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.221
Don't tell Her Royal Pain in the--

09:57.305 --> 09:58.222
[silenced gunshot]

09:59.098 --> 10:01.058
What the--? Joe?

10:01.142 --> 10:02.184
[silenced gunshot]

10:02.893 --> 10:04.770
[suspenseful music playing]

10:07.356 --> 10:11.277
Baltimore is Raymond's only remaining
port of entry on the Eastern Seaboard.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.488
Whoever is doing this
took out three of his port managers.

10:14.572 --> 10:17.283
<i>It's safe to assume</i>
<i>he'll try to take out a fourth.</i>

10:27.376 --> 10:28.377
[silenced gunshot]

10:37.845 --> 10:40.973
-Do you know his name?
-Reginald Lawler.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.434
Let's get him,
and hope we're not too late.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.271
[gunman] Hands in the air.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.282
[tense music playing]

11:06.248 --> 11:07.375
I won't talk.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.590
[yelling]

11:16.300 --> 11:18.552
Oh, I think you will.

11:19.720 --> 11:23.182
Let's start with the same question
I asked the others, huh?

11:23.766 --> 11:24.725
This man.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.186
Where is he?

11:33.526 --> 11:36.570
[Marvin] Lawler's not answering?
Then go there.

11:36.654 --> 11:40.282
I don't care that you just gave birth.
That is not my problem.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.953
-[keypad beeping]
-My problem is $106 million worth of goods

11:44.036 --> 11:47.373
we rerouted to Baltimore
that now can't land in Baltimore

11:47.456 --> 11:49.166
unless you get Lawler to land them.

11:49.250 --> 11:54.672
And until he lands them, we are out 5%
a day in insurance and carrying charges.

11:54.755 --> 11:57.425
So I suggest you wrap Junior in a binky,

11:57.508 --> 12:00.761
shove him onto your mammilla
and go find Lawler.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.972
Lawler's out of pocket.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.850
[keypad clicking]

12:07.143 --> 12:08.269
Yoo-hoo.

12:08.352 --> 12:10.104
Did you hear me? Lawler is AWOL.

12:10.187 --> 12:14.150
-Which means the East Coast is shut down.
-Mierce read the flowers.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.110
Mierce. The shaman?

12:16.861 --> 12:18.112
She's optimistic.

12:18.654 --> 12:21.407
Is she? That's great.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.242
Shaman is optimistic. Fantastic.

12:23.325 --> 12:27.163
It doesn't mean there aren't problems.
It just means we'll figure them out.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.875
Do you value my counsel?

12:31.959 --> 12:33.294
-I do.
-Good.

12:33.878 --> 12:34.837
Because here it is.

12:36.672 --> 12:37.882
You've lost your mind.

12:38.632 --> 12:43.929
The world is falling apart around you,
and you're all beatific because your ex

12:44.013 --> 12:47.600
looked at a photograph
of some dead flowers and said kumbaya.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.310
She's not my ex.

12:49.393 --> 12:54.315
We're just pausing until I resolve
the issues surrounding Elizabeth's death.

12:54.398 --> 12:55.983
That is another thing.

12:56.066 --> 12:58.611
You blame Dembe
for something he didn't do.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.405
Elizabeth's death has been resolved.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.282
Asked. Answered.

13:03.365 --> 13:05.701
As is the reason we are in this mess.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.830
[sighs] Look,
I know this is third-rail stuff,

13:09.914 --> 13:11.957
but you're the one
getting your flowers read,

13:12.041 --> 13:13.334
so, what the hell.

13:14.001 --> 13:17.087
You never should've designated
Elizabeth as your successor.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.964
She wasn't qualified.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.342
And when she passed and you went away,

13:21.425 --> 13:24.261
there was no one to keep all hell
from breaking loose.

13:29.558 --> 13:33.270
[sighs] Seven days, seven countries.

13:33.354 --> 13:36.482
-I am done looking.
-I told you we wouldn't find him.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.108
[Marvin] Well, forgive me for hoping

13:38.192 --> 13:40.945
he might not want his life's work
burned to the ground.

13:41.028 --> 13:43.072
His life's work was Elizabeth.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.241
Well, my life's work was him.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.326
And right now, it is under siege.

13:47.409 --> 13:51.121
Chin in Taipei.
Madrzyk in Dubrovnik. Baptiste in Haiti.

13:51.205 --> 13:52.790
They're all moving against us.

13:52.873 --> 13:55.793
And if we don't put them down,
others will follow.

13:55.876 --> 13:58.420
And when I say we, I mean you.

13:59.713 --> 14:02.675
-Me?
-Starting with Baptiste, who's in Texas

14:02.758 --> 14:04.843
meeting with other turncoats.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.720
Red may have picked Elizabeth,

14:06.804 --> 14:10.432
but we both know
that you are his natural successor.

14:10.516 --> 14:14.144
Now that they're gone,
the organization is yours to run.

14:14.228 --> 14:19.316
-[sighs] And if I don't want to?
-Then it gets sliced and diced.

14:23.779 --> 14:25.656
We weren't equipped for what came.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.741
Least of all Dembe.

14:27.825 --> 14:28.826
Mm-hm.

14:30.911 --> 14:34.331
My point, my counsel, is this:

14:34.915 --> 14:38.502
You left us in the lurch once.
Don't do it again.

14:40.546 --> 14:44.341
Call Marybeth.
Tell her to stay home with her newborn.

14:44.425 --> 14:48.429
If Lawler's not answering, it's because
he's been captured, if not killed.

14:48.512 --> 14:51.348
-If that's the case, we've got no play.
-We do.

14:51.432 --> 14:53.225
I'm sure Dembe's playing it.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.936
Dembe? I thought you wanted him off.

14:56.020 --> 15:00.649
I do. But I have no illusions
that Harold will abide by my request.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.986
And you're wrong about Dembe's abilities.

15:04.069 --> 15:07.448
His not wanting to run my empire
doesn't mean he couldn't.

15:07.531 --> 15:12.286
Believe me, if you and I are realizing
that Lawler's been targeted now,

15:12.369 --> 15:14.455
Dembe's already realized it.

15:15.414 --> 15:19.376
-How can you be sure?
-I told you. Mierce's optimistic.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.130
[suspenseful music playing]

15:23.797 --> 15:24.632
We're in.

15:24.715 --> 15:27.885
Agent Park reports two guards down.
She's waiting on EMTs.

15:27.968 --> 15:30.971
We have no intel on the number of mercs
or where they are.

15:31.055 --> 15:34.642
A TAC unit is on the way. Do not engage
until we know what we're dealing with.

15:46.862 --> 15:50.032
[Dembe, quietly] I see movement.
I don't know who or how many.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.659
I need to get closer.

15:54.578 --> 15:57.331
I'm going to give you one more chance.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.794
Dembe Zuma. Where is he?

16:01.877 --> 16:03.963
I don't know.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.925
[panting]

16:09.093 --> 16:11.679
-[screaming]
-Dembe. Talk to me.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.055
It can't be.

16:13.138 --> 16:15.724
-[Cooper] <i>What is it? What can't be?</i>
-[Dembe] Not what. Who.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.309
Boukman Baptiste.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.686
We don't know who that is.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.312
A man I killed.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.610
[tense music playing]

16:31.824 --> 16:34.451
Daniel. Daniel?

16:35.202 --> 16:36.203
Daniel!

17:03.647 --> 17:06.316
[Dembe] <i>Recon said</i>
<i>his boy would be at home.</i>

17:15.993 --> 17:17.786
This isn't about hurting Raymond.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.621
This is about killing me.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.790
-[screaming]
-If that's true, I want you out of there.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.667
Is that clear? Pull back.

17:25.961 --> 17:27.880
Agent Zuma, do you copy?

17:29.339 --> 17:30.382
Agent Zuma?

17:33.969 --> 17:36.013
[tense music playing]

17:36.096 --> 17:38.057
Ressler, we lost contact with Dembe.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.476
[Ressler over comm] <i>We split up.</i>
<i>I don't have eyes on him.</i>

17:40.559 --> 17:42.311
[Cooper] <i>Circle back, then report.</i>

17:42.394 --> 17:45.939
I have your agent.
I assume there are others.

17:46.023 --> 17:48.317
Tell them to stand down.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.487
Harold Cooper with the FBI.
Who am I speaking to?

17:51.570 --> 17:52.821
-Tell them.
-[Cooper] <i>I will.</i>

17:52.905 --> 17:57.785
<i>-As soon as I hear my agent is all right.</i>
-Your agent killed my son.

17:59.286 --> 18:00.913
I just need to know that he's okay.

18:00.996 --> 18:02.664
He was 10.

18:02.748 --> 18:07.920
Sitting in the back of a car
when your agent murdered him.

18:09.296 --> 18:12.841
That's a tragedy. But killing others
will only make it worse.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.261
Did you know that when you hired him,
that he murdered children?

18:16.345 --> 18:18.847
I'll help you, but you have to help me.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.810
<i>-We have to work together.</i>
-I am not a religious man.

18:22.893 --> 18:28.315
But sometimes,
even a sinner's prayers are answered.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.871
-Was that Dembe? Was he hit?
-I don't know.

18:48.544 --> 18:49.753
[gunfire]

19:10.357 --> 19:12.484
This does not make us even.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.820
Only your daughter does that.

19:14.903 --> 19:17.030
A child for a child.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.472
[Ressler] Drop it. Don't move.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.350
Unclip it. Face the wall.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.825
-Baptiste?
-Gone.

20:02.743 --> 20:05.454
Who is he,
and why was he so interested in you?

20:05.537 --> 20:06.914
To avenge the death of his son.

20:06.997 --> 20:09.666
-[groans]
-I'm sorry you got hurt in this.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.710
Warn Isabella. He was after his daughter.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.295
I got this. Call her.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.838
She needs to be called.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.673
-Just not by me.
-Why not?

20:16.757 --> 20:20.052
It's complicated. I can't explain.
Please, just do it.

20:20.552 --> 20:23.972
202-555-0144.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.644
I thought you and Isabella
got past the tough times.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.062
We did.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.273
-Until we didn't.
-[yells]

20:33.857 --> 20:35.150
[Isabella] I don't understand.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.526
You worked for one white guy,

20:36.610 --> 20:38.654
now you wanna work
for white guys with badges?

20:38.737 --> 20:42.532
I haven't decided yet.
That's why I'm here, to get your opinion.

20:42.616 --> 20:46.370
My opinion is that
I don't want my father to be a Judas.

20:46.453 --> 20:49.873
Isabella, I know these agents.
They're good people.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.627
I never criticized you
for working for Reddington.

20:53.710 --> 20:57.547
I hated it.
My child almost died because of it.

20:57.631 --> 21:01.510
But I told myself that's what you do,
it's not who you are.

21:01.593 --> 21:05.472
It's what I did.
Elizabeth is dead. Raymond is gone.

21:05.555 --> 21:07.849
I'm alone. Looking for a purpose.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.768
Is this really who you are?

21:09.851 --> 21:13.772
-A Black man who wants to be a cop?
-I'm a man that wants to help people.

21:13.855 --> 21:17.985
And a man who's also proud to be Black.
I think I can do both.

21:18.068 --> 21:20.112
Reddington is one man.

21:20.195 --> 21:22.948
The cops are part of a system
of oppression.

21:23.031 --> 21:26.034
People will see you
as a sellout and a traitor.

21:26.118 --> 21:29.037
I don't care. I only care what you see.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.873
You wanna know what I see? George Floyd.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.876
-Breonna Taylor, Philando Castile...
-I see them too.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.337
...Freddie Gray,
Eric Garner, Michael Brown.

21:37.421 --> 21:40.424
I see them,
and I know that could happen to me.

21:40.507 --> 21:43.593
Atatiana Jefferson,
Botham Jean, Alton Sterling.

21:43.677 --> 21:45.679
Isabella, I see them.

21:45.762 --> 21:47.723
I know there's injustice.

21:47.806 --> 21:50.851
But I know justice can be done.
I've seen it done.

21:50.934 --> 21:53.687
And I think I'd find purpose in doing it.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.149
Isabella? Isabella.

22:04.614 --> 22:07.617
[cell phone ringing]

22:12.497 --> 22:15.625
[on machine] <i>This is Isabella.</i>
<i>Leave a message at the beep. Thanks.</i>

22:15.709 --> 22:18.128
It's Agent Ressler again.
I know we keep calling,

22:18.211 --> 22:22.341
but it's important that you call me
as soon as you get this. Thank you.

22:22.424 --> 22:25.052
Look, we've sent agents.
She's gonna be fine.

22:25.135 --> 22:27.763
He got to Hess, Ray and Colby.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.226
Inside, quietly.

22:38.273 --> 22:40.275
[suspenseful music playing]

22:44.571 --> 22:46.823
Isabella? Isabella!

22:47.449 --> 22:48.700
Isabella!

22:52.245 --> 22:53.622
Hey, check it out.

22:58.126 --> 23:00.378
[keypad beeping]

23:02.881 --> 23:04.925
[cell phone ringing]

23:05.008 --> 23:06.718
[Baptiste] Consider yourself lucky.

23:06.802 --> 23:10.138
I'm going to let you have
the opportunity I never got with my boy.

23:10.764 --> 23:12.808
I'm going to let you say goodbye.

23:14.559 --> 23:17.229
Papa? Papa, Papa!

23:18.396 --> 23:20.941
Don't do this. Don't hurt her.

23:21.024 --> 23:22.818
[Baptiste] <i>I have no interest</i>
<i>in hurting her.</i>

23:23.443 --> 23:24.444
Only you.

23:25.946 --> 23:29.491
Reddington. Daniel died
because you wanted his business.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.493
I can help you get some of that.

23:31.576 --> 23:35.580
Ray, Hess, Colby are middle management.
Essential but not important.

23:35.664 --> 23:38.250
I can get you people
who are irreplaceable.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.836
Take them down and Reddington follows.

23:41.795 --> 23:42.712
I'm listening.

23:43.713 --> 23:44.714
I need two hours.

23:44.798 --> 23:45.799
You've got one.

23:48.135 --> 23:50.595
You think he believes
you'll help him take down Reddington?

23:50.679 --> 23:53.265
He should, because it's true.

24:01.189 --> 24:02.524
As quickly as you can.

24:02.607 --> 24:05.026
Yes, Marvin,
that's what I want to talk to you about.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.154
I'll be right there.

24:07.237 --> 24:09.990
[Aram] Hey. I plotted the rest
of the GPS points...

24:10.991 --> 24:12.409
-Later.
-Uh...

24:13.535 --> 24:15.579
-What's going on?
-Baptiste has his daughter.

24:15.662 --> 24:16.538
-What?
-Yeah.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.582
He'll sell out Reddington to get her back.

24:18.665 --> 24:21.084
-That's a joke, right?
-Not to him.

24:21.168 --> 24:22.085
What can we do?

24:22.169 --> 24:24.546
Issue a BOLO on Baptiste,
a Silver Alert on Isabella,

24:24.629 --> 24:26.339
and keep him
from getting Reddington killed.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.842
If Dembe blames himself
for what happened to Liz, he shouldn't.

24:28.925 --> 24:29.759
What?

24:29.843 --> 24:31.678
Let's get out the alerts.
Then I'll show you.

24:32.679 --> 24:33.763
Did you know?

24:34.806 --> 24:37.809
Did you know, when you gave us
the case, that it was Baptiste?

24:37.893 --> 24:41.229
That I'd go in blind
against a man who wants me dead.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.314
I didn't.

24:42.814 --> 24:45.358
I didn't know you were even on the case,

24:45.442 --> 24:47.944
or the task force, for that matter.

24:48.028 --> 24:51.364
I don't want you to get hurt, Dembe.
I just want you out of my life.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.074
He has Isabella.

24:53.158 --> 24:56.161
What? Has he reached out, made any demand?

24:56.244 --> 24:59.623
He has.
And we've come to an understanding.

25:00.498 --> 25:03.627
I'm very sorry.
Is there anything I can do?

25:05.128 --> 25:06.630
You think I betrayed you.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.258
That Elizabeth died
because I let down my guard.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.176
Fine.

25:11.801 --> 25:13.678
I admit that.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.555
But if you want to do something for me,

25:15.639 --> 25:17.599
admit that you let down your guard too,

25:17.682 --> 25:19.267
that night and after.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.729
You abandoned your business
and people died.

25:22.812 --> 25:24.481
That man's son.

25:25.106 --> 25:27.108
-I didn't ask you to carry on.
-[Dembe] No.

25:27.192 --> 25:29.069
You just vanished.

25:30.278 --> 25:32.781
I killed that boy to protect your empire.

25:32.864 --> 25:36.326
I was doing it for you,
because you didn't do it for yourself.

25:37.994 --> 25:41.414
Elizabeth was dead, I was gone,

25:41.498 --> 25:43.333
and you killed that boy.

25:44.709 --> 25:46.878
Do those dots really connect?

25:46.962 --> 25:49.005
It seems a little simplistic.

25:51.424 --> 25:53.760
Excuse me, I have to make a phone call.

26:00.350 --> 26:01.893
I don't think he has any idea

26:01.977 --> 26:05.438
what you were left with
after he disappeared, but I do.

26:05.522 --> 26:07.023
I know all too well.

26:09.442 --> 26:11.361
Isabella won't speak to me.

26:11.444 --> 26:14.948
She says if I do this,
I'll be a traitor to my community.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.702
She won't be the only one
who tells you that.

26:18.785 --> 26:23.456
That joining the FBI makes you a cog
in the machine of institutional racism.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.710
You might remind her
there was a time a Black man or woman

26:26.793 --> 26:29.379
wasn't allowed to wear a badge
or carry a gun.

26:29.462 --> 26:34.259
Thanks to trailblazers like Bass Reeves
and Big Sam Battle who paved the way,

26:34.342 --> 26:37.304
we have the privilege of serving
our community and fellow man.

26:37.887 --> 26:40.140
In fact, scratch that,
it's not a privilege.

26:40.724 --> 26:41.766
It's a responsibility.

26:42.851 --> 26:44.811
I understand where Isabella's coming from,

26:44.894 --> 26:47.731
but our people built this country,
died for it.

26:48.356 --> 26:50.984
We deserve justice
as much as anyone, if not more.

26:51.693 --> 26:56.114
I think this is the place where people
who look like you and me need to be.

26:56.740 --> 26:59.367
Our people need us here,
fighting for them,

26:59.451 --> 27:00.952
fighting for everyone.

27:01.036 --> 27:03.163
Here, in the system, boots on the ground.

27:03.246 --> 27:06.624
Because sometimes we're the only ones
standing between them and the wolves.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.918
In my experience,
there are wolves on both sides.

27:10.253 --> 27:14.049
-Where does Reddington fit in?
-He doesn't, and I can't ask him.

27:14.132 --> 27:17.177
-Because you know what he'll say?
-Because I don't know where he is.

27:17.260 --> 27:20.472
He disappeared one night
without even saying goodbye.

27:22.390 --> 27:24.267
I'm not sure I'm staying with the bureau.

27:24.351 --> 27:26.978
After everything that's happened,
I may need to step away.

27:27.062 --> 27:30.065
But before I do that, if you want this,

27:30.148 --> 27:32.192
I promise you I'll make it happen.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.825
With Baptiste, you said
you've come to an understanding.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.952
-That's right.
-Tell me about it.

27:43.036 --> 27:45.538
Perhaps I can help you
come up with a better one.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.832
I would, before. Not now.

27:47.916 --> 27:49.000
I mean it.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.044
I don't want to see you hurt.

27:51.544 --> 27:54.339
You or anyone you care about.

27:55.215 --> 27:57.175
It was an honor protecting you.

27:57.801 --> 27:59.469
But now I have to protect myself.

28:05.683 --> 28:08.019
-[Ressler] Any word on Isabella?
-I know what I need to do.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.312
Yeah, but does Reddington?

28:09.396 --> 28:12.065
You'll do what you have to do,
but if what you have to do

28:12.148 --> 28:14.651
has to do with what's going on
between you and Mr. Reddington...

28:14.734 --> 28:17.445
He's finished mapping the data points
on VanDyke's cell phone.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.407
-You'll wanna hear what I found.
-Will it help me find Isabella?

28:20.490 --> 28:22.033
[Aram] Well, uh, no.

28:22.117 --> 28:23.660
Then it will have to wait.

28:25.995 --> 28:28.415
-I wish this could help.
-Maybe it can.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.084
How? We didn't get to tell him.

28:31.167 --> 28:32.752
But there's someone else we could.

28:35.630 --> 28:36.589
Dembe. Come in.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.800
I am so glad you called.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.760
This business between you and Raymond,

28:40.844 --> 28:43.680
I want you to know
I think he is overreacting.

28:43.763 --> 28:45.181
I appreciate you saying that.

28:45.265 --> 28:47.851
The suggestion that you are responsible

28:47.934 --> 28:50.019
for what happened
to Elizabeth is preposterous.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.855
-I agree. But the reason--
-Tell me.

28:51.938 --> 28:54.733
What can I do to help set things right?

28:54.816 --> 28:56.109
I will do anything.

28:56.192 --> 28:58.319
I need the names of his banker
in the Caymans,

28:58.403 --> 29:02.115
his arbitrage trader in Beijing,
and the arms dealer he uses in Zagreb.

29:02.198 --> 29:04.617
I knew them before,
but he has other ones now.

29:04.701 --> 29:05.994
Yes, he does.

29:06.077 --> 29:10.331
But, uh, how would me giving you the names
help patch things up between you two?

29:10.415 --> 29:13.585
Yeah, about that, I'm not interested
in patching anything up.

29:13.668 --> 29:16.212
All right, uh, that's, uh...

29:16.296 --> 29:17.714
That's unexpected.

29:17.797 --> 29:19.966
My daughter's life depends
on you giving me the names.

29:20.049 --> 29:21.718
[scoffs] That's unfortunate,

29:21.801 --> 29:26.222
because I'm pretty confident my life
depends on me not giving them to you.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.850
You know Raymond.
He's a stickler for things like,

29:28.933 --> 29:33.104
oh, I don't know, say, not giving
the names of his top three lieutenants

29:33.188 --> 29:34.773
to Boukman Baptiste.

29:34.856 --> 29:36.483
I need the names, Marvin.

29:36.566 --> 29:39.527
I see that,
and I'd give them to you if I could.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.821
I've met Isabella. She's amazing--

29:42.614 --> 29:43.448
[sighs]

29:43.531 --> 29:45.867
I need the names.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.660
This is all of them?

29:47.744 --> 29:49.996
Dembe plotted most of the data points.

29:50.079 --> 29:52.457
I finished mapping them,
then checked what he'd done.

29:52.540 --> 29:56.628
This is every place VanDyke was
the day he shot Elizabeth,

29:56.711 --> 29:59.839
from 12:01 a.m. until he
and his phone ended up in the morgue.

29:59.923 --> 30:02.717
Given everything that was happening,
how did you think to have

30:02.801 --> 30:04.636
VanDyke's phone stolen from the morgue?

30:04.719 --> 30:06.262
Muscle memory.

30:06.346 --> 30:09.182
It was completely involuntary,
like breathing.

30:09.265 --> 30:11.684
Or an innate desire for revenge.

30:11.768 --> 30:16.105
To get his daughter back, Dembe will give
Baptiste information about you.

30:16.189 --> 30:17.732
-What information?
-I don't know.

30:17.816 --> 30:21.903
But I heard him talking on the phone
about getting it from Marvin.

30:22.987 --> 30:25.406
Dembe told us
what you thought happened that day.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.200
This tells a different story.

30:27.283 --> 30:29.619
-Not entirely, but yes.
-[keypad beeping]

30:34.082 --> 30:36.751
-He won't help you.
-Are you calling to gloat?

30:36.835 --> 30:37.877
<i>Put Marvin on.</i>

30:37.961 --> 30:40.505
<i>Whatever you're looking for,</i>
<i>he won't give without my permission.</i>

30:40.588 --> 30:41.798
Why would you give it?

30:41.881 --> 30:44.926
We can discuss that later.
There's no time now. Put him on.

30:49.764 --> 30:51.599
He wants tier-one names.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.686
In the Caymans, Beijing and Damascus.

30:54.769 --> 30:57.313
Give them to him.
I'll get Chuck and Morgan on him.

30:57.397 --> 31:00.108
<i>Baptiste can have the names</i>
<i>if it means freeing Isabella.</i>

31:00.191 --> 31:03.611
But if he acts on the intel, I'm bleeding,
so I need to get eyes on this.

31:07.782 --> 31:10.910
[tense music playing]

31:19.919 --> 31:21.004
Out.

31:21.671 --> 31:23.965
[Chuck] It's a parking facility,
Deming and Clark.

31:24.048 --> 31:26.551
[Raymond over phone] <i>Sit tight.</i>
<i>She's on her way with Santiago.</i>

31:26.634 --> 31:28.469
<i>Nothing happens until Isabella is safe.</i>

31:28.553 --> 31:31.347
-What about the task force?
-You can't go in with them.

31:31.431 --> 31:34.767
I don't trust anyone else, anyway,
so you're on your own.

31:35.685 --> 31:36.978
Yeah.

31:39.022 --> 31:41.316
He's here, and he's clean.

31:41.941 --> 31:43.526
Car stays, you go.

31:43.610 --> 31:44.861
Level three.

31:44.944 --> 31:46.738
[suspenseful music playing]

32:00.919 --> 32:02.170
Isabella.

32:02.253 --> 32:03.463
[Baptiste] I wouldn't.

32:03.546 --> 32:04.839
Papa...

32:04.923 --> 32:06.966
Everything's going to be okay.

32:07.050 --> 32:10.011
-Did you bring the names?
-Let her go, please.

32:10.094 --> 32:12.055
After I have the names.

32:22.190 --> 32:23.232
Tell me...

32:24.651 --> 32:25.902
where do you feel it?

32:26.694 --> 32:31.407
Knowing you are helpless
to save your child.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.952
I know where I felt it.

32:34.035 --> 32:37.038
I'm curious if you feel it there too.

32:40.166 --> 32:42.001
-My back.
-[Baptiste] Exactly.

32:42.543 --> 32:46.047
As if the pain
has a weight you can't bear.

32:47.840 --> 32:51.427
Look at us, so much hatred.

32:51.928 --> 32:53.137
And now...

32:53.972 --> 32:55.556
so much in common.

32:56.140 --> 32:57.684
You said you'd let her go.

32:57.767 --> 32:59.602
I need to verify the names.

32:59.686 --> 33:01.145
That can't be done.

33:01.229 --> 33:04.899
If I couldn't do it,
I wouldn't have asked you to bring them.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.866
[vehicle approaching]

33:19.872 --> 33:21.624
Man, the lot's closed.

33:21.708 --> 33:24.127
[in Spanish] I'm late for a meeting.
You must let me park here.

33:24.210 --> 33:25.878
I don't speak Spanish.

33:28.172 --> 33:30.675
-[in English] Chuck said Dembe went up.
-I'm going down.

33:45.314 --> 33:47.108
Why is this happening?

33:47.734 --> 33:49.110
Did you kill his son?

33:49.986 --> 33:51.070
Did you do it?

33:52.113 --> 33:55.491
After Elizabeth died,
I had to make decisions for Raymond.

33:55.575 --> 33:57.952
Baptiste was taking territory.
We had to stop him.

33:58.536 --> 34:02.331
I led a team that found him
and tried to take him out.

34:02.415 --> 34:04.417
But you took out his son instead.

34:05.084 --> 34:06.419
Is that what happened?

34:08.004 --> 34:08.838
Yes.

34:13.634 --> 34:15.386
And after that, you became a cop.

34:16.012 --> 34:16.846
Yes.

34:18.264 --> 34:21.267
[in unison] I do solemnly swear
that I will support and defend

34:21.350 --> 34:26.314
the Constitution of the United States
against all enemies, foreign and domestic,

34:26.397 --> 34:29.317
that I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same.

34:32.945 --> 34:36.074
-Congratulations, special agent.
-Thank you.

34:36.157 --> 34:38.159
It wouldn't have happened without you.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.288
Isabella didn't come. I'm sorry.

34:49.587 --> 34:50.922
The names are correct.

34:52.131 --> 34:55.468
You have what you want. Let her go.

34:55.551 --> 34:58.012
Nothing you do will bring Daniel back.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.932
[tense music playing]

35:12.485 --> 35:16.072
The French take billions
from our poor country every year.

35:16.155 --> 35:19.617
Corrupt politicians take from the poor

35:19.700 --> 35:23.329
and open our ports
to people like Reddington.

35:23.412 --> 35:26.457
This is about more than revenge.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.544
This is about power.

35:29.627 --> 35:32.255
This is about taking what I am owed.

35:32.338 --> 35:35.758
What my countrymen are owed.

35:44.308 --> 35:46.477
There are two kinds
of people in the world,

35:47.145 --> 35:50.022
wolves and sheep.

35:50.106 --> 35:52.733
The wolves take.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.778
The sheep get taken.

35:58.406 --> 36:00.074
[Baptiste] Unfortunately for you...

36:02.577 --> 36:03.578
I am a wolf.

36:10.084 --> 36:11.836
-[engine revs]
-[tires screech]

36:15.131 --> 36:17.717
Whoever you are, you're a little late.

36:18.342 --> 36:20.761
Somebody's about to get shot.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.763
I wouldn't have picked the wolf.

36:22.847 --> 36:23.806
Who asked you?

36:23.890 --> 36:26.767
They may be an alpha predator,
but they only travel in packs.

36:27.518 --> 36:30.104
Something tells me
you're not dealing with sheep here.

36:31.772 --> 36:32.982
[groaning]

36:33.065 --> 36:33.900
[gunshot]

36:36.444 --> 36:37.486
It's done.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.780
[gasping]

36:43.743 --> 36:45.161
A wolf...

36:46.037 --> 36:48.873
would put me out of my misery.

36:50.791 --> 36:51.918
Maybe.

36:52.543 --> 36:55.171
But I'm an FBI agent,
so you're under arrest.

36:55.671 --> 36:58.299
The names you gave them,
were they able to confirm the identities?

36:58.382 --> 36:59.467
Yes.

37:04.764 --> 37:05.890
[gurgling]

37:09.977 --> 37:12.188
Trace the last call, and take care of it.

37:14.190 --> 37:16.984
Raymond has something he wants
to show you as soon as you can.

37:17.693 --> 37:20.363
-It's good to see you, Dembe.
-You too.

37:30.665 --> 37:32.416
[Raymond] This is the complete mapping

37:32.500 --> 37:35.962
of VanDyke's whereabouts
on the day Elizabeth was killed.

37:36.045 --> 37:39.715
I know we've talked
about my lack of awareness

37:39.799 --> 37:43.719
and that I should have seen
VanDyke watching us at the coffee shop.

37:43.803 --> 37:46.764
But I wanted to plot this
because I've also been agonizing

37:46.847 --> 37:51.769
over the fact that maybe I was the reason
VanDyke was there in the first place,

37:51.852 --> 37:53.938
that I led him to Elizabeth.

37:54.021 --> 37:56.023
Well, as it turns out, you didn't.

37:56.816 --> 38:00.403
He was nowhere near you that day,
not before the coffee shop.

38:01.237 --> 38:03.656
Which means he didn't follow you there.

38:03.739 --> 38:05.658
And we know where Elizabeth was?

38:05.741 --> 38:09.287
Yes. I've plotted her day
more times than I care to remember.

38:09.954 --> 38:14.542
So if VanDyke didn't follow either of you,
how did he know where to go?

38:14.625 --> 38:16.669
[Raymond] Someone obviously told him.

38:16.752 --> 38:18.921
Yeah, but who could have known?

38:19.547 --> 38:22.049
I'm as big a conspiracy theorist
as the next guy,

38:22.133 --> 38:25.136
but this sounds like
some classic <i>Third Man</i> stuff.

38:25.678 --> 38:27.388
[Raymond] You know, that night,

38:28.014 --> 38:29.557
I couldn't sleep.

38:29.640 --> 38:33.269
I felt like if I stayed, I would implode,

38:33.352 --> 38:38.524
that I'd collapse into myself
like a black hole and cease to exist.

38:39.358 --> 38:40.318
So I left.

38:40.818 --> 38:43.863
I walked away and kept walking...

38:45.489 --> 38:48.743
until I found Weecha and Mierce.

38:48.826 --> 38:49.994
And they helped me.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.705
And I helped them.

38:57.752 --> 39:00.004
I'm sorry that I abandoned you.

39:02.048 --> 39:05.009
Whatever happened,
I shouldn't have done that.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.889
And I'm sorry that I did.

39:12.266 --> 39:14.727
I know you're upset
that I gave Elizabeth the letter.

39:14.810 --> 39:16.062
Ah, it's done.

39:18.439 --> 39:20.733
Perhaps it did bring her some peace.

39:21.275 --> 39:24.278
But we can't be fighting each other

39:24.362 --> 39:27.156
when we have
a real enemy to fight, to find.

39:28.115 --> 39:30.826
You'll have to forgive Marvin.
He's a professional skeptic.

39:30.910 --> 39:34.622
But someone led
Elizabeth's killer to her that night.

39:35.164 --> 39:39.085
And we need to work together
to find who that was.

39:40.211 --> 39:43.589
But that's a quest
that will have to wait another day.

39:43.672 --> 39:45.716
I'm late to a very important engagement.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.928
More important
than finding out who killed Elizabeth?

39:49.553 --> 39:50.554
I think so.

39:55.935 --> 39:59.105
[Raymond] "Pippi was sure that her mother
was now up in heaven,

39:59.188 --> 40:02.400
watching her little girl
through a peephole in the sky,

40:02.483 --> 40:06.570
and Pippi often waved up at her
and called, 'Don't you worry about me.

40:06.654 --> 40:08.697
I'll always come out on top.'"

40:08.781 --> 40:10.699
[poignant music playing]

40:10.783 --> 40:12.368
[Isabella] That was so awful.

40:12.451 --> 40:13.869
It was my fault.

40:13.953 --> 40:15.287
It's all my fault.

40:15.371 --> 40:20.292
I want to protect you,
but all I do is put you in harm's way.

40:20.376 --> 40:23.379
-Can you promise me it's over?
-With Baptiste, yes.

40:23.462 --> 40:26.674
With everything,
with what you've done with Reddington,

40:26.757 --> 40:29.051
is it done coming back to us? To me?

40:30.261 --> 40:31.262
I don't know.

40:33.305 --> 40:35.307
I'm going away with Elle.

40:35.391 --> 40:37.143
Not forever, but for now.

40:37.226 --> 40:38.310
Where will you go?

40:38.394 --> 40:40.396
I don't think I should tell you that.

40:41.105 --> 40:44.150
This isn't a punishment.
It's not about you being a cop.

40:44.233 --> 40:46.485
-I know.
-No, really, it's not.

40:46.569 --> 40:48.112
I was upset with you about that.

40:48.195 --> 40:51.532
And I'd be lying
if I said I still wasn't upset.

40:52.408 --> 40:56.954
But you can be a police officer
and a man who's proud to be Black.

40:57.621 --> 41:00.082
I know that
because I know that's who you are.

41:02.418 --> 41:03.961
I want you to feel safe.

41:04.753 --> 41:07.715
And I want us to be together.
I've missed you.

41:07.798 --> 41:09.383
I've missed you too.

41:12.845 --> 41:15.973
-Can I see Elle before you go?
-Of course.

41:16.056 --> 41:19.351
I was reading her a story.
I'm sure she'd love for you to finish it.

41:21.979 --> 41:26.358
"'You have plenty of courage,
I am sure,' answered Oz.

41:26.442 --> 41:30.321
'All you need is confidence in yourself.

41:31.322 --> 41:36.577
There is no living thing
that is not afraid when it faces danger.'"

41:36.660 --> 41:38.621
"Her father, Pippi had not forgotten.

41:38.704 --> 41:41.707
He was a sea captain
who sailed on the great ocean,

41:41.790 --> 41:44.293
and Pippi had sailed with him in his ship,

41:44.376 --> 41:48.631
until one day, her father blew overboard
in a storm and disappeared."

41:48.714 --> 41:52.843
"'True courage is in facing danger
when you are afraid,

41:52.927 --> 41:56.805
and that kind of courage,
you have in plenty.'

41:57.515 --> 42:01.769
'Perhaps I have, but I'm scared
just the same,' said the Lion."

42:01.852 --> 42:05.272
"But Pippi was absolutely certain
that he would come back.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.441
She'd never believe he had drowned.

42:07.525 --> 42:12.154
She was sure he'd floated until he landed
on an island inhabited by cannibals.

42:12.238 --> 42:14.949
And she thought he had become
the king of all the cannibals

42:15.032 --> 42:18.077
and went around with a golden crown
on his head all day long.

42:18.160 --> 42:21.121
'My papa is a cannibal king.
It certainly isn't every child...'"

42:23.415 --> 42:25.417
