I know y'all ain't gonna like this shit.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.610
- I want to flip A-Train.
- [Hughie] What?

10:10.610 --> 10:12.988
- You're joking.
- Fuck that.

10:12.988 --> 10:14.573
We turn A-Train informant,

there's no bigger fish than him.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.952
- Yeah, or he could murder you.
- He did help clear your Starlighters.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.788
Guys, I know when
a motherfucker's wavering, okay?

10:21.788 --> 10:24.041
And A-Train, he's right there, he's ready.

10:24.041 --> 10:25.667
One guess what my problem
with this might be?

10:25.667 --> 10:26.918
No. No.

10:26.918 --> 10:29.004
- I think we should bring Butcher back.
- Fuck no.

10:29.004 --> 10:31.923
And need I remind you
who still runs this operation.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.634

I thought that was the point.

I've told you that. I'm-- It's just...

16:48.341 --> 16:50.969
You know, it's-it's too risky.

16:52.220 --> 16:54.431

48:19.480 --> 48:21.190
hating me and thinking I'm the villain,

48:21.190 --> 48:23.651
and I would never ask
for your forgiveness.

48:28.823 --> 48:32.660
But I'm really sorry, Hughie,
that I hurt you.

48:34.495 --> 48:37.915
[sighs] I was just fucked up, you know?

48:37.915 --> 48:40.209
Like...

48:40.209 --> 48:42.003
everyone.

48:43.171 --> 48:44.797
I don't know.

48:50.470 --> 48:54.349
[Kessler] You think that carfentanil
was easy to score?

48:54.349 --> 48:56.184
Why didn't you give him
the fucking cookie?

48:56.184 --> 48:58.061
Boy wants to keep talking.

48:58.061 --> 49:00.772
We don't got to kidnap him.
We can just fucking ease him into it.

49:00.772 --> 49:02.231
And who has time for that?

49:02.231 --> 49:05.610
You? How long before you drop dead?

49:06.736 --> 49:09.614
Hi. CIA. I can find a medical file.

49:09.614 --> 49:11.741
The whole world is about to burn,

49:11.741 --> 49:13.868
- Billy, we need the kid.
- Need the kid?

49:13.868 --> 49:15.828
I fucking told you, we ain't turning him

49:15.828 --> 49:17.372
into an asset. He ain't ready.

49:17.372 --> 49:19.207
By the time he's ready, it'll be too late.

49:19.207 --> 49:21.542
Everything will be burnt down.

49:23.628 --> 49:25.755
You asked me

49:25.755 --> 49:28.966
if I could train up my boy.

49:28.966 --> 49:30.843
You're damn right I could.

49:30.843 --> 49:33.096
And if he died,
I would cry at his funeral,

49:33.096 --> 49:37.183
but I would be proud of him
for saving the fucking world.

49:37.183 --> 49:39.143
Jesus Christ, Joe, he's 12 years old.

49:39.143 --> 49:41.104
And if he takes after his dad?

49:42.230 --> 49:46.651
Either we figure out how to train him...

49:46.651 --> 49:49.237
or we figure out how to kill him.

49:49.237 --> 49:51.489
[tense, dramatic music playing]

49:55.201 --> 49:57.328
[door opens]

49:57.328 --> 49:58.663
[door closes]

49:58.663 --> 50:01.040
<i>You look fat.</i>

50:01.040 --> 50:04.168
<i>Why are you sticking out
all in the gut area?</i>

50:04.168 --> 50:05.461
[chuckles]

50:05.461 --> 50:07.755
- [bride on TV] <i>Do I look pregnant?</i>
- Yes.

50:07.755 --> 50:09.215
[door opens]

50:09.215 --> 50:12.510
- [door closes]
- Hey, smartass.

50:12.510 --> 50:14.095
Where you get off?

50:14.095 --> 50:16.514
Crime Analytics was my department.

50:16.514 --> 50:18.641
My angelfish and I had
a great thing going.

50:18.641 --> 50:20.268
And I had nothing to do with that leak.

50:20.268 --> 50:22.019
- I know.
- I wasn't even...

50:22.019 --> 50:23.813
What is that?
Is that a Bloomin' Onion from Outback?

50:23.813 --> 50:26.065
Yeah. You want some?

50:26.065 --> 50:27.734
Yeah.

50:29.026 --> 50:30.236
Mm.

50:37.326 --> 50:38.745
Mmm.

50:39.996 --> 50:41.998
- It's good.
- [chuckles] I know.

50:45.918 --> 50:48.463
Are you doing okay?

50:48.463 --> 50:51.507
- It's a tough day.
- Mm.

50:51.507 --> 50:53.092
Hey.

50:53.092 --> 50:55.845
You want to watch <i>Transformers 2?</i>

50:55.845 --> 50:57.597
The one with the-the racist robots?

50:57.597 --> 51:00.641
[chuckles] It's funny you mention that.
Shia's actually a good buddy of mine.

51:00.641 --> 51:03.519
He wants me to be
in <i>Honey Boy 2.</i> [chuckles]

51:03.519 --> 51:05.396
Script just isn't there yet, though.

51:05.396 --> 51:07.231
Oh, yeah. That's tough.

51:09.066 --> 51:13.154
You know, at first,
I kind of thought you were a bitch,

51:13.154 --> 51:15.239
but you're actually pretty fucking cool.

51:18.075 --> 51:20.828
- You're hot.
- You're totally fucking hot.

51:20.828 --> 51:22.497
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

51:22.497 --> 51:24.123
- You like that?
- Yes.

51:24.123 --> 51:25.750
Oh, don't tease me like that.

51:25.750 --> 51:28.252
- Like that? Ah.
- Mm...

51:28.252 --> 51:29.921
Oh...

51:29.921 --> 51:32.256
[passionate moaning]

51:46.729 --> 51:49.565
[door opens, shuts]

51:52.819 --> 51:54.821
- Where have you been?
- Sorry.

51:54.821 --> 51:56.864
I flew to Coney Island
to get those hot dogs.

51:58.199 --> 51:59.492
You're lying.

51:59.492 --> 52:00.785
No, I'm not.

52:00.785 --> 52:02.453
You've been at William Butcher's.

52:02.453 --> 52:04.831
I can smell him on you.

52:04.831 --> 52:07.208
I wanted to see him.

52:07.208 --> 52:08.584
[scoffs]

52:08.584 --> 52:10.169
He's going through a tough time.

52:10.169 --> 52:11.379
Why do you care

52:11.379 --> 52:13.714
when you have everything here?

52:13.714 --> 52:16.092
You have a home, you have a father.

52:16.092 --> 52:18.344
I've given you everything
that I ever wanted,

52:18.344 --> 52:20.012
and it's still not good enough for you.

52:20.012 --> 52:21.264
Why?!

52:21.264 --> 52:22.974
You're ungrateful.

52:22.974 --> 52:26.060
You go behind my back. You lie to me.

52:27.270 --> 52:28.813
Why?

52:30.523 --> 52:31.816
[exclaims]

52:34.402 --> 52:37.238
Why am I not good enough for you?

52:37.238 --> 52:40.074
[stammers] No, I...

52:40.074 --> 52:41.576
It's just Butcher...

52:41.576 --> 52:43.327
Butcher. You know what?

52:43.327 --> 52:45.454
If you love him so much,
why don't you get him to be your dad?

52:45.454 --> 52:47.164
No, I don't want him to be my dad.

52:47.164 --> 52:49.125
- You're my...
- Enough!

52:49.125 --> 52:50.877
Enough!

52:54.338 --> 52:55.882
[groans]

52:59.719 --> 53:01.804
Aw, fuck.

53:01.804 --> 53:03.389
Fuck.

53:09.645 --> 53:11.856
[Homelander reflection 1] John?

53:14.275 --> 53:15.943
John.

53:17.361 --> 53:18.571
Come here.

53:23.117 --> 53:27.079
John, come here.

53:28.372 --> 53:31.167
You really made a mess this time, tiger.

53:32.501 --> 53:35.963
Come on, champ, pull yourself together.

53:35.963 --> 53:37.340
Deep breath.

53:37.340 --> 53:39.842
For God's sakes, look at you.

53:39.842 --> 53:42.762
A few Starlighters hate you,
Ryan spends some time with Butcher,

53:42.762 --> 53:44.972
and, aw, boo-hoo, you're a fucking mess.

53:44.972 --> 53:48.601
You have to be stronger, John. For Ryan.

53:48.601 --> 53:50.061
You still need love.

53:50.061 --> 53:51.979
- You're pushing him away.
- So much love.

53:51.979 --> 53:54.357
- You still crave it.
- No, that's not true.

53:54.357 --> 53:57.610
You're gonna make him weak
and needy, like you.

53:57.610 --> 53:59.904
You can still fix things. He's your son.

53:59.904 --> 54:02.365
He hates you. He's gonna turn on you.

54:02.365 --> 54:03.991
- Your blood.
- Everyone hates you.

54:03.991 --> 54:07.286
Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

54:07.286 --> 54:11.165
It's time to overcome this need for love,

54:11.165 --> 54:14.377
this sickness, once and for all.

54:14.377 --> 54:18.172
You're never gonna be your true self
until you transcend your humanity.

54:18.172 --> 54:19.465
What do I do?

54:19.465 --> 54:21.968
[reflections] You need to go
back to the start.

54:21.968 --> 54:24.428
