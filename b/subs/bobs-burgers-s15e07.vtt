07:46.432 --> 07:47.634
About surfing?

07:47.635 --> 07:49.470
Some of it, yeah.
On the Mississippi.

07:49.471 --> 07:52.042
But those waves are bigger.
I'm no oceanologist,

07:52.043 --> 07:55.851
but wouldn't big waves make you
go farther and win the contest?

07:55.951 --> 07:58.322
Uh, well, I mean,
some people might say that.

07:58.422 --> 07:59.925
But others would say,

07:59.926 --> 08:02.464
"Wave too big,
don't dance that jig."

08:02.565 --> 08:06.104
- Mark Twain again?
- No, that's, uh... Jamiroquai.

08:06.205 --> 08:09.478
Dad, where's the golden-boy
boogie-boarder from yesteryear?

08:09.612 --> 08:11.616
'Cause I'd love to meet him.

08:13.620 --> 08:14.755
[gasping loudly]

08:14.756 --> 08:16.191
[Louise]
Come on, Dad!

08:16.192 --> 08:18.096
Boogie your butt on out here!

08:18.196 --> 08:19.398
Oh, boy.

08:19.498 --> 08:21.635
[Gene]
<i>Mom, the birthday party is gone.</i>

08:21.636 --> 08:25.475
But the cupcakes are here,
alive and well, and so are we.

08:25.476 --> 08:27.447
Gene's right. It's time
to kill those cupcakes.

08:27.448 --> 08:28.850
With-with our mouths.

08:28.851 --> 08:30.486
All right. Fine.

08:30.487 --> 08:31.656
Yay!

08:31.657 --> 08:32.991
[entry bells jingling]

08:32.992 --> 08:35.029
- Oh, uh, hold off
on the cupcakes.
- Damn it!

08:35.030 --> 08:37.567
Oh, hey, Teddy.
You're here... with some people.

08:37.568 --> 08:39.771
Yeah. Handymen and handywoman.

08:39.772 --> 08:41.175
I'm Joyce, the handyma'am.

08:41.275 --> 08:44.447
Ha. I love it.
Aw, but sorry about your friend.

08:44.448 --> 08:47.052
Linda, you remember Glenn,
and this is Lou.

08:47.053 --> 08:48.756
- Hi, Lou.
- Hello.

08:48.757 --> 08:50.259
So, did Teddy tell you
it's his bir--

08:50.360 --> 08:52.598
Uh, we're just here to have
a beer and talk about Vernon.

08:52.599 --> 08:54.168
- That's all.
- Okay. Okay.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.471
[sniffles] I didn't think
I was gonna get so broken up.

08:56.472 --> 08:58.743
Yeah, you cried loudly
at the service.

08:58.744 --> 09:00.747
- Super loud.
- Aw.

09:00.748 --> 09:02.552
Hey, this round's on the house.

09:02.652 --> 09:03.987
Some beer for your tears.

09:04.088 --> 09:06.158
And... maybe some fries
for your cries?

09:06.258 --> 09:07.963
Oh, okay. Yeah, sounds good.

09:08.063 --> 09:10.232
- Lots of fries.
- Kids, uh, give me a hand.

09:10.233 --> 09:11.535
[whispering]
Secret meeting.

09:11.536 --> 09:13.139
[whispering]
Mom forgot how to use the fryer.

09:13.239 --> 09:14.676
[whispering]
So embarrassing.

09:14.776 --> 09:16.912
Listen,
I think we can work with this.

09:16.913 --> 09:18.282
Teddy and his friends will talk
about Vernon,

09:18.283 --> 09:19.986
they'll get sick of that,
and then they'll be ready

09:20.086 --> 09:21.589
to move on
to something a little more fun.

09:21.590 --> 09:23.158
Are you sure that's what they--

09:23.159 --> 09:25.163
Tina, you are this close to
not being invited to the party.

09:25.263 --> 09:26.567
- Got it. Got it.
- Aah!

09:26.700 --> 09:28.537
- Not yet.
- But soon.

09:28.671 --> 09:29.971
Louise, are you sure

09:29.972 --> 09:32.010
you don't want to go back
to where we were?

09:32.110 --> 09:33.914
Loserville? No.

09:34.014 --> 09:35.918
Ooh, look at this one!
Let's catch it.

09:36.018 --> 09:37.588
No, that--
It looks pretty big.

09:37.688 --> 09:38.756
- Let's duck under it.
- Ugh.

09:38.757 --> 09:40.761
- [panting]
- Ah, come on.

09:40.762 --> 09:42.263
We should have taken it!

09:42.363 --> 09:44.200
No, that-that wave was, um,

09:44.201 --> 09:45.604
- gross.
- Gross?

09:45.605 --> 09:47.107
Yeah. Squishy and gross.

09:47.207 --> 09:49.812
Those are technical terms.
Uh, you'll learn it all later.

09:49.813 --> 09:52.450
Oh, ho, ho,
here comes another good one!

09:52.451 --> 09:53.953
- Louise, I don't think--
- I'm going for it!

09:53.954 --> 09:56.257
- No, no, no. No!
- Yes, yes, yes.

09:56.258 --> 09:58.095
[whooping]

09:58.196 --> 09:59.497
That was amazing.

09:59.498 --> 10:01.502
Dad, did you see me?!

10:01.503 --> 10:04.542
Yeah. G-Good, uh, job with it.

10:04.543 --> 10:05.878
Why didn't you tell me

10:05.978 --> 10:07.582
that oceans are like
free roller coasters,

10:07.715 --> 10:10.019
and not just big, stinky,
wet places where fish pee?

10:10.020 --> 10:12.657
Oh, you know,
Louise, they also poop.

10:12.658 --> 10:14.428
There's less poop
closer to shore.

10:14.563 --> 10:16.332
It's the-the jet stream,
I think, so--

10:16.432 --> 10:18.169
Okay,
why are you being so weird?

10:18.269 --> 10:19.805
Weird? I'm not being weird.

10:19.806 --> 10:22.409
Is this about your incident
or accident

10:22.410 --> 10:23.980
or whatever
Mom was talking about?

10:24.081 --> 10:26.185
- I mean--
- Just tell me what happened.

10:26.285 --> 10:30.159
Okay. Okay. Uh, it was a big
wave day, like today.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.730
<i>I had a bunch
of really good rides,</i>

10:31.830 --> 10:33.800
<i>and then, this huge wave just</i>

10:33.801 --> 10:36.471
<i>rolled me
and pounded me against the sand.</i>

10:36.472 --> 10:38.943
<i>And I-I couldn't get up. I...
I-I couldn't get my head up.</i>

10:38.944 --> 10:40.947
- [gasping]
<i>- A lifeguard had to pull me out.</i>

10:40.948 --> 10:43.486
- [Louise] <i>Oh.</i>
- [Bob] <i>And when
he dragged me onto the beach,</i>

10:43.587 --> 10:45.023
<i>I realized</i>

10:45.123 --> 10:46.593
<i>the wave had completely
pulled my bathing suit down.</i>

10:46.693 --> 10:48.461
- What's that?
- It's a penis.

10:48.462 --> 10:51.034
- No, it's not.
- Don't look at me!

10:51.035 --> 10:53.206
Wait, but didn't Mom say
you were in, like,

10:53.306 --> 10:54.474
six inches of water?

10:54.609 --> 10:56.312
Ugh. Yes, she loves
to point that out,

10:56.445 --> 10:59.218
but it doesn't matter
if it's six feet or six inches.

10:59.318 --> 11:01.421
When a wave is pounding you,
you don't even know

11:01.422 --> 11:04.428
which way is up or if
you're ever gonna breathe again.

11:04.529 --> 11:05.964
Oh.

11:05.965 --> 11:08.904
But, uh, that was just,
like, one time.

11:09.004 --> 11:10.975
And, you know, I didn't die.

11:11.075 --> 11:12.143
As you can see.

11:12.243 --> 11:14.548
Right here. Hello. So,

11:14.549 --> 11:16.285
I'm sure everything
will go fine today,

11:16.385 --> 11:18.689
and we will also not die.

11:18.690 --> 11:21.094
So, uh, go team?

11:21.194 --> 11:22.765
<i>Heads up, boogie boys and girls.</i>

11:22.865 --> 11:25.435
<i>The contest is about
to kick off, and lucky us,</i>

11:25.436 --> 11:26.905
<i>these waves just keep getting</i>

11:26.906 --> 11:28.843
<i>bigger and bigger.</i>

11:28.944 --> 11:32.383
Yeah. Lucky us.
[chuckles nervously]

11:32.384 --> 11:33.820
- Whee!
- I think we're

11:33.920 --> 11:35.824
the cutest ones here.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.869
So, you ready?
Uh, how-how you feeling?

11:41.870 --> 11:43.338
Oh, you mean after
the worst pep talk ever?

11:43.339 --> 11:46.947
Yeah, that-that was bad.
I'm sorry about that.

11:47.047 --> 11:48.550
"Hey, we're competing
in this thing,

11:48.551 --> 11:51.255
"here's a graphic story about
how I almost drowned doing it,

11:51.388 --> 11:52.792
but, uh, have fun, sport."

11:52.892 --> 11:54.360
I didn't call you "sport."

11:54.361 --> 11:56.364
Could-could we just pretend
like I never said anything?

11:56.365 --> 11:59.605
Like you had to do with Gene
after you guys had the sex talk?

11:59.606 --> 12:02.210
What? No...!

12:02.310 --> 12:03.244
Yes, like that.

12:03.245 --> 12:05.550
You know what?
I'm fine. I can do this.

12:05.651 --> 12:07.354
Plus, it's a hundred bucks
if we win,

12:07.454 --> 12:09.057
which we will because
I'm incredible at this.

12:09.058 --> 12:10.560
[announcer]
<i>All right guys,</i>

12:10.661 --> 12:12.063
<i>here's how the
contest is gonna work:</i>

12:12.064 --> 12:13.566
<i>You've all been
assigned to groups.</i>

12:13.567 --> 12:15.235
<i>Heat one, heat two
and heat three.</i>

12:15.236 --> 12:17.373
<i>You're gonna ride a wave,
then wait on the beach</i>

12:17.374 --> 12:18.810
<i>till we call your heat again.</i>

12:18.811 --> 12:20.045
<i>We're gonna do that three times.</i>

12:20.046 --> 12:21.716
<i>Our judges
will be awarding points</i>

12:21.717 --> 12:23.953
<i>for longest distance,
technical form,</i>

12:23.954 --> 12:25.757
<i>and boogiest boarding.</i>

12:25.758 --> 12:28.263
Thanks for ordering
all these big waves, Daddy.

12:28.363 --> 12:30.300
Just kidding.
I know they're from a storm

12:30.400 --> 12:31.602
or the Moon or something.

12:31.603 --> 12:32.605
[laughs] Good.

12:32.705 --> 12:35.142
I need you to focus,
okay, Court?

12:35.143 --> 12:36.879
[Glenn]
<i>And remember
when Vernon started</i>

12:36.980 --> 12:39.283
charging more for
the 36-inch trencher

12:39.284 --> 12:41.354
than he did for
the 48-inch trencher?

12:41.355 --> 12:44.159
Yes, I noticed that
and asked him, what gives?

12:44.160 --> 12:45.530
And he said
more people want the 36.

12:45.630 --> 12:47.735
- More people want the 36.
- More people want the 36.

12:47.869 --> 12:48.936
- [laughter]
- Listen to that.

12:48.937 --> 12:51.142
They're coming out of it.
The energy is picking up,

12:51.242 --> 12:53.813
the mood is shifting.
I think we're good to go.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.182
Uh, I don't know.

12:55.183 --> 12:57.153
Gene, go hold the door open,
watch for my signal.

12:57.253 --> 12:59.991
Then you signal Tina.
Tina, you go light the candle

12:59.992 --> 13:01.895
and bring
the cupcakes out, okay?

13:01.896 --> 13:03.198
I don't like my job.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.902
I feel like I should
bring the cupcakes out.

13:04.903 --> 13:06.104
No, do it like I said.

13:06.105 --> 13:07.473
You're not good with lighters.

13:07.574 --> 13:09.644
They should make lighters
that are easier for kids.

13:09.645 --> 13:10.647
Kid lighters.

13:10.648 --> 13:12.016
Shh, get in position.

13:12.017 --> 13:13.720
I also have party hats
and noisemakers,

13:13.721 --> 13:15.423
but let's wait and see
on those, okay?

13:15.524 --> 13:16.758
Ah, that was a nice service.

13:16.759 --> 13:17.961
Very nice.

13:17.962 --> 13:19.231
- The exact right length.
- [Joyce] Yup.

13:19.331 --> 13:20.667
- [lighter clicks]
- [Lou] But his poor wife,

13:20.768 --> 13:22.537
- she's all alone now.
- [Teddy] Right.

13:22.538 --> 13:24.173
- [Tina blows out candle]
- [Teddy] Yeah, she did say
something about

13:24.174 --> 13:25.744
taking a cruise later this year.

13:25.844 --> 13:27.246
[Lou]
Oh. Well, that's nice.

13:27.247 --> 13:28.750
- [lighter clicks]
- [Joyce] Yeah, well, it was

13:28.884 --> 13:30.218
the cruise they were supposed
to take together.

13:30.219 --> 13:32.022
[Glenn]
Their 50th anniversary cruise.

13:32.023 --> 13:33.292
- [Teddy] Yeah...
- [Tina] Damn it. [blows]

13:33.392 --> 13:35.462
Okay, Linda.
Let's turn this around.

13:35.463 --> 13:38.969
Ah, life. Huh? Am I right?

13:38.970 --> 13:40.005
- Yeah.
- Yup.

13:40.006 --> 13:41.041
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:41.042 --> 13:42.410
Speaking of life, uh,

13:42.511 --> 13:44.381
today's Teddy's birthday.

13:44.481 --> 13:45.183
Eh...

13:45.283 --> 13:46.553
- You don't say.
- [Glenn] What?

13:46.653 --> 13:47.820
- Oh, no kidding.
- [Glenn] Huh.

13:47.821 --> 13:49.090
Ah, uh...

13:49.191 --> 13:51.662
Oh, it's good
to celebrate a little.

13:51.663 --> 13:52.931
No, no, no. No, no.

13:52.932 --> 13:54.801
- Yeah.
- No.

13:54.802 --> 13:55.770
Yeah, you gotta, you know.

13:55.771 --> 13:58.009
All right. Uh, bring out

13:58.109 --> 13:59.645
the cupcakes. Tina, hurry.

13:59.745 --> 14:00.780
<i>♪ Happy... ♪</i>

14:00.781 --> 14:01.916
[Glenn cries]

14:02.050 --> 14:04.020
I'm sorry, sorry.

14:04.120 --> 14:04.823
Crap.

14:04.923 --> 14:06.225
Thanks, Linda.

14:06.325 --> 14:08.564
You have to blow it out
or the wax will, um...

14:08.664 --> 14:09.465
I-I'll do it.

14:09.566 --> 14:11.770
[whispering]
I wish this day would end.

14:11.870 --> 14:13.973
Yep, could not get any worse.

14:14.073 --> 14:16.076
- Hello.
- [grumpily] Oh, great.

14:16.077 --> 14:17.982
- I mean, hi. Mort.
- Ooh, cupcakes.

14:18.082 --> 14:19.250
[Gene]
<i>Get your own!</i>

14:19.350 --> 14:20.953

<i>Heads up, fathers and daughters</i>

<i>in heat two, these monster
waves are for you.</i>

14:24.829 --> 14:26.098
You ready, Dad?

14:26.198 --> 14:28.368
And is your bathing suit
properly secured? [chuckles]

14:28.369 --> 14:30.139
Heh. Yes. Kind of.

14:30.239 --> 14:31.074
This one?

14:31.075 --> 14:32.845
- Um...
- Whoa. [laughs]

14:32.945 --> 14:34.781
Uh, let's do it.

14:34.782 --> 14:36.251
Paddle. Kick. Go.

14:36.352 --> 14:38.221
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm doing it.

14:38.222 --> 14:39.123
Oh, oh.

14:39.124 --> 14:41.661
Heh. Well, that was all right.

14:41.662 --> 14:43.867
Yeah, that-that-that
wasn't that bad.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.201
Yeah, if we rode it any farther,

14:45.202 --> 14:47.374
we'd need a plane ticket
to get back.

14:47.474 --> 14:49.577
Um, this one?

14:49.578 --> 14:51.649
Uh, yeah.

14:52.918 --> 14:54.722
Whoa, whoa.

14:54.855 --> 14:56.424
- Whoa!
- Louise!

15:03.005 --> 15:04.909
- You okay?
- Yeah.

15:05.009 --> 15:07.112
Does your chin hurt?
It looks like you scraped it.

15:07.113 --> 15:09.350
It's-it's fine. I'm fine.

15:09.351 --> 15:11.523
Besides, what's
a tiny little bit

15:11.623 --> 15:13.192
of drowning every now and then?

15:13.292 --> 15:14.027
S-Sure.

15:14.127 --> 15:15.496
You want to make an omelet,

15:15.497 --> 15:17.066
you gotta hold a few eggs
under water until they choke

15:17.067 --> 15:18.736
and scrape their chins, right?

15:18.737 --> 15:19.738
Uh...

15:19.739 --> 15:22.076
Okay. All right. [groans]

15:22.176 --> 15:23.345
You know what though?

15:23.446 --> 15:25.315
- I don't need a hundred bucks.
- What?

15:25.316 --> 15:28.021
Yeah, I'll easily
make that much myself.

15:28.022 --> 15:29.356
Over a few decades.

15:29.357 --> 15:31.194
Maybe we should just
call it, huh?

15:31.195 --> 15:32.865
Oh, really? [stammers]

15:32.965 --> 15:35.035
- You want to leave?
- Yeah, I think I'm good

15:35.036 --> 15:36.204
on ocean stuff for now.

15:36.205 --> 15:38.208
It's big, it's dumb. I get it.

15:38.209 --> 15:41.114
I mean, i-if that's
what you want, okay.

15:41.115 --> 15:42.785
It is. Yeah, let's go home.

15:42.885 --> 15:44.053
All right.

16:04.228 --> 16:05.696
[Louise]
That was the right move. Right?

16:05.697 --> 16:06.933
Know when to call it quits.

16:07.033 --> 16:08.201
Not that we're quitters.

16:08.202 --> 16:09.772
We're smart. We're smart-ers.

16:09.872 --> 16:10.774
Uh-huh. Yup.

16:10.874 --> 16:12.176
They're all gonna die.

16:12.177 --> 16:13.378
I mean, hopefully not.

16:13.379 --> 16:15.350
They're gonna die,
they're gonna die.

16:15.450 --> 16:17.888
They might make it,
but they'll be traumatized.

16:17.889 --> 16:19.525
[Bob sighs]

16:22.163 --> 16:23.666
[noisemaker blows]

16:25.103 --> 16:26.873
- What?
- Well,

16:26.973 --> 16:28.274
I think I'm gonna head out.

16:28.275 --> 16:29.978
- Happy birthday, Teddy.
- Oh.

16:29.979 --> 16:31.982
Yeah, I'm gonna shove off, too.

16:31.983 --> 16:33.185
Happy birthday, Teddy.

16:33.186 --> 16:35.856
Yeah, thanks for having us?

16:35.857 --> 16:37.427
I didn't, uh...

16:37.528 --> 16:38.764
Yup. [groans]

16:38.864 --> 16:40.199
Uh... uh, wait.

16:40.299 --> 16:41.669
Uh, we haven't
had ice cream yet.

16:41.769 --> 16:44.074
You get free ice cream
on your birthday, right?

16:44.174 --> 16:45.375
What? No, no.

16:45.376 --> 16:47.379
Just Teddy gets
free ice cream, or...

16:47.380 --> 16:49.818
All of you.
You-you all get free ice cream.

16:49.819 --> 16:51.255
I'd stay for
a little soft serve.

16:51.355 --> 16:53.258
I'd stay for a lot
of soft serve.

16:53.259 --> 16:55.129
And sprinkles?
I mean, not-not a deal-breaker,

16:55.229 --> 16:56.297
but if you have 'em...

16:56.298 --> 16:57.801
Do we have to have ice cream?

16:57.901 --> 16:59.236
- Shh.
- What? I'd have a tea.

16:59.237 --> 17:00.973
Oh, this damn thing again.

17:00.974 --> 17:03.514
Come on, come on...

17:03.614 --> 17:06.250
Huh. My uncle
has a diner up in Hillsboro.

17:06.251 --> 17:07.655
This happens
with his soft serve.

17:07.755 --> 17:09.157
It's probably the flow screw.

17:09.258 --> 17:12.196
Eh, I'd say it's more likely
there's just a buildup in there.

17:12.197 --> 17:14.099
I told the machine
it needed more fiber.

17:14.100 --> 17:15.803
I'm just saying,
we should pry the cap off

17:15.804 --> 17:17.274
the dispensing hole
and poke around.

17:17.407 --> 17:19.310
No, no, start with
the flow screw.

17:19.410 --> 17:21.315
Wow, handy people
with their handy tools.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.152
This place has turned into
a real handy-land.

17:23.285 --> 17:26.457
Oh, wait. Um, why don't we
make a little game out of it?

17:26.458 --> 17:27.294
- Huh?
- Eh?

17:27.394 --> 17:29.297
A little party game. Come on.

17:29.397 --> 17:32.604
Linda, just, don't.
No more party talk.

17:32.605 --> 17:34.140
A game? I like games.

17:34.141 --> 17:35.576
- I'd play... Yeah.
- All right.

17:35.577 --> 17:37.145
A game best served soft.

17:37.146 --> 17:38.348
Joyce gets it.

17:38.349 --> 17:39.652
- Whose kids are those?
- I don't know.

17:39.752 --> 17:41.789
You know where
you don't die of drowning?

17:41.923 --> 17:44.159
On the land.
There's a 99% chance

17:44.160 --> 17:47.032
you won't drown in the ocean
when you're on land.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.301
Hey, uh, I just want to say,

17:48.302 --> 17:50.173
Louise, again, I'm sorry

17:50.273 --> 17:51.742
I told you
my boogie boarding story

17:51.743 --> 17:53.912
while you were boogie boarding.

17:53.913 --> 17:55.015
For the first time.

17:55.016 --> 17:56.250
I'm glad you told me that story.

17:56.251 --> 17:58.154
That story saved our sad lives.

17:58.155 --> 18:00.325
But... I mean, I did have fun.

18:00.326 --> 18:01.361
When I wasn't drowning.

18:01.461 --> 18:03.366
I know. I mean, I-I saw you.

18:03.466 --> 18:05.069
I actually
had a lot of fun, too.

18:05.169 --> 18:07.673
I... I like boogie boarding.

18:07.674 --> 18:09.277
Whoo-hoo!

18:09.278 --> 18:11.181
Linda, did you see that?

18:11.182 --> 18:13.018
Mm-hmm. That was great.

18:13.687 --> 18:15.924
What's happening?
Why are we stopping?

18:16.058 --> 18:17.026
What if we go back?

18:17.027 --> 18:18.095
Go back? To the beach?

18:18.195 --> 18:19.331
I think if we hurry,

18:19.431 --> 18:21.200
we can make it back for...

18:21.201 --> 18:22.469
for our third wave.

18:22.470 --> 18:24.407
What? So now
you're fine with dying?

18:24.408 --> 18:27.180
You know, Jamiroquai
and Mark Twain also said,

18:27.280 --> 18:28.950
um, don't not do fun stuff

18:29.051 --> 18:31.320
'cause your dad
got scared one time.

18:31.321 --> 18:33.324
Look, I'm glad you got me
back in the water,

18:33.325 --> 18:34.794
back on the boogie board.

18:34.795 --> 18:37.767
I should have done that
right away after my... incident.

18:37.768 --> 18:39.571
I-I missed a ton of waves.

18:39.572 --> 18:41.942
And a lot of chances
to show your penis?

18:41.943 --> 18:43.078
Right.

18:43.079 --> 18:45.850
So, uh, What do you say?

18:47.353 --> 18:48.624
More to the left.

18:48.724 --> 18:50.325
- Here?
- No, left, left.

18:50.326 --> 18:52.396
Wait, is my left your right?

18:52.397 --> 18:53.733
We're facing the same direction.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.368
So my left is your...

18:55.369 --> 18:56.905
- Left.
- No, but you're behind me.

18:56.906 --> 18:58.944
- Yes.
- Put up your left hand.

18:59.044 --> 19:00.780
- Here.
- That's your left hand?

19:00.781 --> 19:02.484
It's the same as your left hand.

19:02.585 --> 19:04.387
- [bell dings]
- Sorry, time's up.

19:04.487 --> 19:06.157
Joyce and Lou,
get in there. Go on.

19:06.158 --> 19:07.828
You're going down, birthday boy.

19:07.928 --> 19:10.198
[Lou]
This is a great game.
What else can we fix?

19:10.199 --> 19:11.502
I have an old Honda.

19:11.603 --> 19:13.272
I've got a casket
I can't get open.

19:13.372 --> 19:14.542
- Mort.
- What?

19:14.642 --> 19:15.977
There's no one in it.
I don't think.

19:15.978 --> 19:18.449
Hey. My little
boogie beavers are back.

19:18.550 --> 19:20.253
- How'd it go?
- Oh, I don't know,

19:20.353 --> 19:22.991
how about...
we got fourth place?

19:22.992 --> 19:24.662
Oh, that's great!

19:24.762 --> 19:26.297
- Yeah.
- Oh, your face.

19:26.398 --> 19:27.633
Eh, it's nothing.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.638
I mean, I almost died,
and I wanted to quit,

19:29.639 --> 19:32.242
but then I learned from
Dad's many mistakes

19:32.243 --> 19:33.513
and said,
"No, we gotta go back."

19:33.613 --> 19:35.148
- [Bob] We both said it.
- I said it better.

19:35.149 --> 19:36.151
And we rode

19:36.251 --> 19:37.286
<i>our final wave to fourth place,</i>

19:37.287 --> 19:38.690
<i>which is a Belcher first place.</i>

19:38.790 --> 19:40.993
[Bob]
<i>Partially thanks
to me doing a 360,</i>

19:40.994 --> 19:43.399
which I definitely
did on purpose.

19:43.499 --> 19:45.537
And not only did I get
this intimidating scar,

19:45.637 --> 19:47.540
we got these
for coming in fourth.

19:47.541 --> 19:48.375
Ooh.

19:48.376 --> 19:49.746
Perfect for the opera.

19:49.846 --> 19:51.749
Well, how about some
fourth place ice cream?

19:51.849 --> 19:52.850
- Yeah!
- As soon as

19:52.851 --> 19:54.153
our ice cream machine is fixed.

19:54.253 --> 19:56.057
Yeah, what's happening here?

19:56.058 --> 19:56.859
Handypeople party games.

19:56.860 --> 19:58.495
Yeah, Dad.
Haven't you ever been to

19:58.597 --> 20:01.034
a handypeople
funeral/birthday party?

20:01.134 --> 20:02.570
- That's it. Look at that.
- Whoa, whoa.

20:02.571 --> 20:03.906
- Is it...
- We've got ice cream

20:03.907 --> 20:05.976
- Aw, c'mon.
- We got it. We win!

20:05.977 --> 20:07.247
All right!

20:07.347 --> 20:09.383
I have to admit, this is nice,

20:09.384 --> 20:10.620
being celebrated a little bit.

20:10.621 --> 20:12.223
Thanks for
making this happen, Linda,

20:12.323 --> 20:14.193

so many times not to.

20:14.194 --> 20:15.495
Aw, you're worth it, Teddy.
