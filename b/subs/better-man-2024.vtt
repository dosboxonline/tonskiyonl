<i>I recall thinking
two things that day -</i>

24:46.708 --> 24:49.750
<i>a fifth of the spotlight
is better than nothing, and...</i>

24:50.916 --> 24:53.957
<i>...if anyone from
Stoke sees me,</i>

24:53.958 --> 24:55.874
<i>I'm fucking dead.</i>

25:01.791 --> 25:02.874
Tikka masalas all round,

25:02.875 --> 25:04.207
no coriander for the boys.

25:04.208 --> 25:06.124
-  Thank you.
- No coriander?

25:06.125 --> 25:07.790
<i>Whenever Nigel
took us out for dinner,</i>

25:07.791 --> 25:09.040
<i>he would always say...</i>

25:09.041 --> 25:10.915
I'll put this on your account.

25:10.916 --> 25:13.749
<i>He wasn't joking.
He recouped it all.</i>

25:13.750 --> 25:17.666
Look around the table, go on.

25:18.958 --> 25:24.083
In five years, we're all going
to hate each other.

25:26.166 --> 25:29.457
But we'll be fucking rich.

25:29.458 --> 25:31.249
Now, first things first.

25:31.250 --> 25:33.624
We work up our act,
we take it on the road.

25:33.625 --> 25:35.374
What about a record deal?

25:35.375 --> 25:37.749
Well, that will come,
we'll get your demo sent out,

25:37.750 --> 25:39.082
we'll let the
bidding war begin.

25:39.083 --> 25:41.249
- Ah, but...
- Yes.

25:41.250 --> 25:45.624
Before that, let's shore up
your backstories.

25:45.625 --> 25:49.332
Mark and Jason, you were in
a breakdancing group together.

25:49.333 --> 25:52.457
Gary and Howard, you were in
a band called The Cutest Rush.

25:52.458 --> 25:53.832
Was I the lead?

25:53.833 --> 25:55.707
You weren't then, my chicken,
and you're not now.

25:55.708 --> 25:57.749
Fuck off!

25:57.750 --> 26:00.124
Robert, you had
a bit part in 'Brookside'.

26:00.125 --> 26:01.415
Oh, I was fucking great,
wasn't I?

26:01.416 --> 26:02.915
You were a bit much, frankly.

26:04.666 --> 26:06.332
Nige, can't we just say
I'm a songwriter?

26:06.333 --> 26:07.749
I've got a ton of lyrics.

26:07.750 --> 26:09.457
Well, I can hold my breath
for two minutes

26:09.458 --> 26:11.665
but I'm not trying to be
a fucking submarine, am I?

26:15.250 --> 26:18.708
Gary writes the songs, yeah?

26:19.500 --> 26:21.291
You lot toe the line.

26:22.791 --> 26:26.915
Oh, and also, your name's not
Robert anymore - it's Robbie.

26:26.916 --> 26:28.790
Oh, tuck in, lads.

26:28.791 --> 26:30.874
<i>I fucking hated
the name Robbie,</i>

26:30.875 --> 26:33.541
<i>but it was the single best
thing Nigel did for me.</i>

26:34.291 --> 26:37.082
<i>Robbie became a character.
Something I could hide behind.</i>

26:37.083 --> 26:39.624
Oh, now, the name of the band?

26:39.625 --> 26:41.249
Oh, Nige,
I've got a good one.

26:41.250 --> 26:42.457
Kick It!

26:42.458 --> 26:44.999
That's fucking awful.

26:46.833 --> 26:50.082
I've already got the name
and it's brilliant.

26:50.083 --> 26:52.041
And clench!

26:53.291 --> 26:55.332
Take That!

26:55.333 --> 26:56.832
Oh!

26:56.833 --> 26:58.999
<i>Initially,
Nigel's plan was for us to be</i>

26:59.000 --> 27:00.207
<i>a band for the gay scene.</i>

27:00.208 --> 27:02.040
- Alright!
<i>- ♪ La-la-la-la-la!</i>

27:02.041 --> 27:04.040
Let's do this. Just
remember what you rehearsed.

27:04.041 --> 27:05.915
- Robbie, you alright?
-  Don't be nervous.

27:05.916 --> 27:07.625
- You all look amazing.
- Light 'em up.

27:08.041 --> 27:09.749
Robbie, what you doing?
Hurry up.

27:09.750 --> 27:11.415

27:13.500 --> 27:15.124

all my gay friends</i>

27:17.083 --> 27:19.040
<i>have slept with me
and said I was crap.</i>

27:19.041 --> 27:20.665
<i>I'm not bothered they
said I slept with them.</i>

27:20.666 --> 27:22.999

27:23.000 --> 27:24.874

-  Alright.

29:23.916 --> 29:27.332
Settle down. Settle down.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.374
Will you lot shut up?!

29:29.375 --> 29:31.457
I felt like Elvis, but thin.
Ha ha!

29:31.458 --> 29:33.790
I've got good news!

29:33.791 --> 29:35.374
- Good news.
- Good news?

29:35.375 --> 29:38.957
We've had some interest
from a few record labels...

29:38.958 --> 29:40.540
- Oh, fuck off!
- ...in London.

29:40.541 --> 29:42.540
- Oh!
- London! Yes!

29:42.541 --> 29:44.874
- That's absolutely fantastic!
- Yes!

29:44.875 --> 29:47.207
- Thank you so much.
-  Yeah, you deserve it.

29:47.208 --> 29:49.207
- You've all done really well.
- Yes! Yes!

29:50.750 --> 29:52.499
Except for one of ya.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.208
Ooh.

29:56.458 --> 29:58.291
We all know who that is,
don't we?

30:04.458 --> 30:06.750
Robbie talked to
a local reporter.

30:08.333 --> 30:12.082
"We're like the A-team.
I'm the sexy, talented one."

30:12.083 --> 30:13.290
Who the fuck gave you--

30:13.291 --> 30:14.915
I didn't know she was
a reporter, Nige.

30:14.916 --> 30:16.624
You know, I almost
started to like you,

30:16.625 --> 30:19.000
but you've fucking
ended that, haven't ya?

30:19.791 --> 30:22.000
- Fuck off!
- What was that?

30:24.541 --> 30:27.624
I think, uh, Robbie's developing
a sense of humour, Nige.

30:28.666 --> 30:29.915
You think it'd be difficult

30:29.916 --> 30:31.374
to go to Stoke-on-Trent,

30:31.375 --> 30:35.333
get another scally with ratty
hair and call him Robbie?

30:36.916 --> 30:39.332
Right, the club wants us
to do a meet-and-greet.

30:39.333 --> 30:41.040
There's going to be
lots of girls in here,

30:41.041 --> 30:42.957
so let's get one thing clear -

30:42.958 --> 30:44.332
keep it in your pants.

30:44.333 --> 30:45.457
No touching.

30:45.458 --> 30:47.165
- No telephone numbers.
- What?

30:47.166 --> 30:48.332
- No dating.
- No touching?

30:48.333 --> 30:49.540
- Seriously?
- Ever!

30:49.541 --> 30:51.290
- Nige?!
- Ever!

30:51.291 --> 30:52.957
What's the point of
bringing them up here

30:52.958 --> 30:54.957
- if we can't touch them?
-  Let's get this done.

30:54.958 --> 30:56.790
- Alright! Bring 'em up!
- Nige!

31:02.750 --> 31:04.832
Hi.

31:04.833 --> 31:06.249
I love you all!

31:06.250 --> 31:08.499
<i>Nigel had
many rules for Take That,</i>

31:08.500 --> 31:12.499
<i>and the most important was that
we always appeared attainable.</i>

31:12.500 --> 31:14.624
Safe sex is important...

31:14.625 --> 31:16.790
<i>He even made us
do a Safer Sex tour</i>

31:16.791 --> 31:18.790
<i>for the Family
Planning Association.</i>

31:18.791 --> 31:20.040
So, remember...

31:20.041 --> 31:23.166
Don't be a fool,
cover his tool.

31:25.750 --> 31:27.457
<i>Naturally,
I took it all to heart.</i>

31:27.458 --> 31:30.290
Oh, I love the way
you move, Gary.

31:30.291 --> 31:32.915
<i>I was happy to
play Gary for the moment.</i>

31:32.916 --> 31:34.082
Wow.

31:34.083 --> 31:36.290
I'll never wash
my hands again.

31:39.041 --> 31:40.999
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah?

31:41.000 --> 31:43.249
Oh, my God, Hurry up,
hurry up! Quick!

31:43.250 --> 31:46.708
- Oh, that's it.
- Gary, I already stopped.

31:47.166 --> 31:50.707
<i>And there it was,
the one time in Nigel's life</i>

31:50.708 --> 31:52.457
<i>he wasn't the biggest
wanker in the room.</i>

31:57.416 --> 31:59.957
Right.
Straight up.

31:59.958 --> 32:02.832
There's no appetite,
want or need for boybands.

32:02.833 --> 32:06.291
They died a death.
It's all grunge now.

32:13.458 --> 32:15.665
- Did you hear our demo?
- Yes.

32:19.708 --> 32:22.499
These boys are going to
take this country by storm.

32:22.500 --> 32:24.207
And if you don't sign
them right now,

32:24.208 --> 32:25.790
I'll take them to another label

32:25.791 --> 32:28.749
and you'll be the twat that
let the biggest band in history

32:28.750 --> 32:31.375
slip through your pudgy
fucking fingers.

32:35.041 --> 32:37.207
You won't do any of that,

32:37.208 --> 32:39.082
'cause everyone else said no.

32:39.083 --> 32:40.707
I only agreed to see you

32:40.708 --> 32:44.124
because my daughter
saw you boys live,

32:44.125 --> 32:46.582
and she's obsessed.

32:46.583 --> 32:50.124
She assures me that you
are amazing in the flesh.

32:50.125 --> 32:51.833
So...

32:52.791 --> 32:55.833
...I'm going to take a punt that
you're right about these boys.

32:56.958 --> 33:00.416

Every day, there's a new lot.

36:56.208 --> 36:57.457
The coach brings them in.

36:57.458 --> 36:58.707
They come into the garden,

36:58.708 --> 37:00.249
they nick the wood
off the fence,

37:00.250 --> 37:01.540
the clothes off the line.

37:01.541 --> 37:03.499
Someone should do
something about this.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.374
Mum, they want this to happen.

37:05.375 --> 37:07.207
I went down the post office
the other day

37:07.208 --> 37:08.874
and someone called me
a posh slag.

37:08.875 --> 37:11.624
Oh, love, you're not posh.

37:11.625 --> 37:14.165
It's not funny. I can't make
my deliveries anymore.

37:14.166 --> 37:15.665
I'm having to shut
the business, Robert.

37:15.666 --> 37:19.165
Guess who's recording the
lead vocals for our new song?

37:19.166 --> 37:20.374
Mm-hm.

37:20.375 --> 37:22.290
I'll get us out
of this shithole

37:22.291 --> 37:25.625
and buy us a fortress,
just like Gary.

37:27.041 --> 37:29.499

37:49.041 --> 37:50.875
I'm a pop star now.

37:52.500 --> 37:55.291
Fat little Robert isn't going
to sell any albums, is he?

37:57.333 --> 37:59.583
I'm just giving the people
what they want.

38:07.958 --> 38:11.249
I go onstage
and act like a gladiator

38:11.250 --> 38:13.708
and I pretend that the whole
world is lucky to see me.

38:15.791 --> 38:18.250
And they all act accordingly.

38:24.416 --> 38:26.000
They don't see what I see.

38:27.666 --> 38:30.083
Then stop!

38:30.833 --> 38:33.041
See, that's the

Well, come on then.
Give us a look.

39:31.541 --> 39:33.124
- Will I get a credit?
- I don't know.

39:33.125 --> 39:34.833

39:37.041 --> 39:38.957
- Wouldn't you like to know?
-  Fuck off.

39:40.791 --> 39:42.415

-  Whatever.

39:42.416 --> 39:44.790
Hey. At least
pretend to give a toss.

39:44.791 --> 39:46.582
- What, about all this?
-  Yeah.

39:46.583 --> 39:47.915
Are you kidding?

39:47.916 --> 39:50.290
Do you have any idea how
naff people think we are?

39:50.291 --> 39:52.290
Oh, fuck off, Robbie,
they bloody love us.

39:52.291 --> 39:54.583
Do you think Oasis
does this shit?!

39:55.250 --> 39:56.332
We need to branch out.

39:56.333 --> 39:57.457
Write something that's not

39:57.458 --> 39:59.457

39:59.458 --> 40:01.915
- And this coming from you.
- Uh...

40:01.916 --> 40:04.207
The one who only shines
when the light's on him.

40:04.208 --> 40:06.165
-  Alright, Gaz.
- No, no, let him speak.

You've missed me, haven't you?

01:04:27.208 --> 01:04:28.541
Ah, of course you have.

01:04:29.666 --> 01:04:31.832
Hmm! Hey, so...

01:04:31.833 --> 01:04:34.083
You know my girlfriend,
Kayleigh?

01:04:35.458 --> 01:04:36.999
- Kayleigh.
- The one with the clubfoot?

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.499
No, she ain't got a clubfoot.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.082
- Well...
- No. Her pelvis is out.

01:04:40.083 --> 01:04:44.416
Anyway, she's... up the duff.

01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:46.833
I'm going to be a dad.

01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:54.207
That's amazing.

01:04:54.208 --> 01:04:55.915
I'm just surprised the
little thing still works.

01:04:55.916 --> 01:04:57.249
Fuck off!

01:04:57.250 --> 01:04:58.665
Shut up! Shut up! Here it is.

01:04:58.666 --> 01:05:00.332
<i>The wait is over!</i>

01:05:00.333 --> 01:05:03.124
<i>Coming in at number one,

01:05:03.125 --> 01:05:05.790

01:05:16.125 --> 01:05:17.457
Whoo!

01:05:17.458 --> 01:05:19.333
Come on!

01:05:23.125 --> 01:05:25.332
- I can't believe it!
- Well done, babe.

01:05:25.333 --> 01:05:28.624
- You deserve it.
- It'll be your turn next.

01:05:30.375 --> 01:05:33.415
Nicole,
give us a few words!

01:05:33.416 --> 01:05:35.750
Yes. Nicole.

01:05:38.208 --> 01:05:40.375
Okay. Ahh, I just...

01:05:41.125 --> 01:05:42.749
I can't believe we did it.

01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:45.290
Number fucking one!

01:05:45.291 --> 01:05:47.915
To everyone who has supported
us through the years,

01:05:47.916 --> 01:05:50.165
you're family,
and we love you.

01:05:52.791 --> 01:05:54.082
Whoo!

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:56.416
And to my...

01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:00.499
Ah, to my best friends...

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.874
Having a number one is amazing

01:06:02.875 --> 01:06:05.249
and getting to celebrate it
together is the best.

01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:07.457
<i>Liam Gallagher
was the lead singer of Oasis,</i>

01:06:07.458 --> 01:06:09.374
<i>the biggest band on the planet.</i>

01:06:09.375 --> 01:06:12.124
<i>I'm in love with their songs.
I'm in love with the lyrics.</i>

01:06:12.125 --> 01:06:13.749
<i>I'm in love with how
provocative they are.</i>

01:06:14.916 --> 01:06:16.665
<i>I'm just totally
in love with them,</i>

01:06:16.666 --> 01:06:18.374
<i>and I want to be them.</i>

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:20.665
<i>Fame is a
powerful aphrodisiac.</i>

01:06:20.666 --> 01:06:22.707
<i>It means even ugly people
can get laid.</i>

01:06:24.041 --> 01:06:26.374
<i>Mind you,
guitars do that, too.</i>

01:06:26.375 --> 01:06:27.957
What's all that about, then?

01:06:27.958 --> 01:06:29.207
Got a number one.

01:06:29.208 --> 01:06:30.582
Is that all?
Fucking hell.

01:06:30.583 --> 01:06:32.999
If I orgasmed every time
I had a number one,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.290
I'd be fucking dry.

01:06:34.291 --> 01:06:35.374
Yeah.

01:06:35.375 --> 01:06:37.874
- You listen to this cunt?
- Yeah!

01:06:37.875 --> 01:06:39.790
Like he fucking knows what
we're fucking talking about.

01:06:39.791 --> 01:06:41.249
You want a number one,

01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:42.957
you should've stayed
Gary's back-up dancer.

01:06:44.541 --> 01:06:46.249
Guess who's had
the largest ever demand

01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:48.707
for concert tickets
in British history?

01:06:48.708 --> 01:06:49.999
Me.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.165
And the band--

01:06:51.166 --> 01:06:53.124
Knebworth, right?

01:06:53.125 --> 01:06:55.457
125,000 fucking
screaming cunts.

01:06:55.458 --> 01:06:56.874
That's insane.

01:06:56.875 --> 01:06:59.332
It's how you know you've
made it, fucking knobhead.

01:07:00.875 --> 01:07:02.957
<i>Me and Liam
wouldn't always be so cuddly.</i>

01:07:02.958 --> 01:07:05.957
<i>Would anybody like
to see me fight Liam?</i>

01:07:08.166 --> 01:07:10.582
<i>Liam, a hundred grand
of your money,</i>

01:07:10.583 --> 01:07:11.957
<i>a hundred grand of my money.</i>

01:07:11.958 --> 01:07:13.957
<i>We'll get in the ring
and we'll have a fight</i>

01:07:13.958 --> 01:07:15.582
<i>and you can all
watch it on TV.</i>

01:07:15.583 --> 01:07:17.207
<i>What do you
think about that?</i>

01:07:17.208 --> 01:07:18.665
<i>Now are you going to do it</i>

01:07:18.666 --> 01:07:20.832
<i>or are you going to pussy out,

01:07:22.541 --> 01:07:23.707
<i>Thankfully,</i>

01:07:23.708 --> 01:07:25.708
<i>he wasn't in the country

01:07:28.458 --> 01:07:30.207
Knebworth...

01:07:31.625 --> 01:07:33.415
Come on, let's go.
This is shit.

01:07:35.083 --> 01:07:37.333
- Nice chatting to you, Noel.
- Fuck off, cunt.

01:07:41.291 --> 01:07:44.166
Hey, twinkletoes,
you coming or what?

01:07:45.166 --> 01:07:46.625
Yeah. Come on.

01:07:53.625 --> 01:07:56.540
<i>♪ Never ever
have I ever felt so sad ♪</i>

01:07:56.541 --> 01:07:57.957
Whoo!

01:08:02.666 --> 01:08:04.625
Good evening, Knebworth.

01:08:05.166 --> 01:08:07.166
You all look gorgeous tonight.

01:08:07.708 --> 01:08:09.791
Here's one from my new album.

01:08:10.333 --> 01:08:11.540
Thank you very much.

01:08:12.958 --> 01:08:14.833
Hiya.

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:18.374
Fuck me, aren't you
Miss Number One

01:08:18.375 --> 01:08:20.707
of the United Kingdom
of Britain?

01:08:21.916 --> 01:08:24.250
- Maybe.
- Mm-hm.

01:08:25.375 --> 01:08:26.832
And where did you end up?

01:08:26.832 --> 01:08:29.207
I got kidnapped by
Liam Gallagher.

01:08:29.207 --> 01:08:30.665
Oh...

01:08:30.666 --> 01:08:32.957
And you looked like you were
having a good enough time.

01:08:35.875 --> 01:08:40.625
Anyway, I was just trying
to make sense of it.

01:08:41.582 --> 01:08:42.875
Of what?

01:08:44.416 --> 01:08:46.041
"Never Ever".

01:08:50.375 --> 01:08:53.249
You don't... What? You don't...
You don't like our song?

01:08:53.250 --> 01:08:56.791
Oh, it's fine. I mean, I'm not
sure it's a number one, but...

01:08:59.082 --> 01:09:01.707
Well, people seem to like it.

01:09:01.707 --> 01:09:03.415
It would be nice if my fiancé--

01:09:03.416 --> 01:09:08.957
Screaming, jumping around,
making fucking speeches...

01:09:08.957 --> 01:09:11.582
And all that bullshit
about family.

01:09:11.582 --> 01:09:14.499
It's not bullshit.
It's everything to me.

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:15.832
Right.

01:09:15.832 --> 01:09:18.040
So did you tell them
that you gave up our family

01:09:18.041 --> 01:09:19.457
to get that number one, then?

01:09:21.166 --> 01:09:22.375
Nah.

01:09:23.166 --> 01:09:25.957
I bet you left that bit out of
your little speech, didn't you?

01:09:31.875 --> 01:09:33.624
You're so fucking ugly
when you're wasted.

01:09:33.625 --> 01:09:35.415
Well, I'll be sober tomorrow.

01:09:35.416 --> 01:09:37.374
Oh, and won't that be nice!

01:09:37.375 --> 01:09:40.332
I can't believe I had to tell
everyone that you left tonight

01:09:40.332 --> 01:09:41.665
because something
important came up.

01:09:41.666 --> 01:09:42.874
It did.

01:09:42.875 --> 01:09:44.290
Getting fucked up
with your mates?

01:09:44.291 --> 01:09:46.499
At least they know how
to write a proper number one.

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:47.957
Which is more than you can.

01:09:47.957 --> 01:09:49.707
Scribbling lyrics
in your little notebook,

01:09:49.707 --> 01:09:51.540
but you're too scared
to show them to anyone.

01:09:51.541 --> 01:09:54.540
A number one and she's
giving out the advice.

01:09:54.541 --> 01:09:57.915
I didn't ask you to lie to
your friends, 'cause guess what,

01:09:57.916 --> 01:10:00.249
I don't give a fuck
what they think!

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:03.375
You give a fuck
what everyone thinks, Rob.

01:10:03.958 --> 01:10:06.541
That's all you give
a fuck about.

01:10:25.541 --> 01:10:27.207
Dickhead.

01:10:35.916 --> 01:10:37.874
We need crisps.

01:10:37.875 --> 01:10:39.874
We're alright, Nan.

01:10:39.875 --> 01:10:42.665
Well, I don't want you
wasting away on me.

01:10:42.666 --> 01:10:44.999
They don't have washing
machines in London?

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.499
Yeah, but you
do it with love.

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:48.874
Oh, you bugger.

01:10:48.875 --> 01:10:50.915
You should come home
more often, you know.

01:10:50.916 --> 01:10:52.999
She's slowing down.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.957
Rubbish.
Nan will outlive all of us.

01:10:55.958 --> 01:10:58.082
Anyway, I'm about
to be very busy.

01:10:58.083 --> 01:10:59.707
I rang around
and I've got a meeting

01:10:59.708 --> 01:11:01.791
with a producer
called Guy Chambers.

01:11:02.916 --> 01:11:04.790
Nicole's got a number one.

01:11:04.791 --> 01:11:07.249
Fucking Gary's
got number ones.

01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:09.749
And here I am turning
into a farmyard animal.

01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:12.582
I wouldn't change
a hair on your head.

01:11:12.583 --> 01:11:13.749
Bless you, Nan.

01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:16.290
Now,
I spoke to your dad.

01:11:16.291 --> 01:11:18.165
Oh, that makes one of us.

01:11:18.166 --> 01:11:19.790
It's been radio silence
since I left the band.

01:11:19.791 --> 01:11:22.415
He's agreed to see you again.

01:11:22.416 --> 01:11:24.749
Agreed? What do you mean?

01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:27.791
Well, to have you visit,
on your school holidays.

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:37.207
He called me, remember?

01:11:37.208 --> 01:11:38.666
He said it'd been too long.

01:11:39.791 --> 01:11:40.874
He invited me.

01:11:40.875 --> 01:11:43.958
Yes, that's right.
I told him to.

01:11:45.333 --> 01:11:46.916
You see?

01:11:49.208 --> 01:11:51.957
-  Oh, Jesus...
- Oh, Betty.

01:11:51.958 --> 01:11:53.665
No, no, no.

01:11:53.666 --> 01:11:56.874
-  I'm so sorry.
- Oh, Betty.

01:11:56.875 --> 01:11:58.790
No.

01:11:58.791 --> 01:12:00.499
It's alright.

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:02.415
Hey, Nan, it's alright.

01:12:02.416 --> 01:12:03.582
Shhh.

01:12:03.583 --> 01:12:05.290
Come on. Don't cry.

01:12:05.291 --> 01:12:07.707
It's alright.

01:12:07.708 --> 01:12:10.165

-  I'm so sorry, love.

01:12:10.166 --> 01:12:11.999

01:23:58.958 --> 01:24:00.874
Now, I could do you
a couple of numbers.

01:24:00.875 --> 01:24:01.999
Four at most.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.332
It's incredible.

01:24:03.333 --> 01:24:05.957
It also comes
with a new record deal.

01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:07.665
It's obscene!

01:24:07.666 --> 01:24:09.540
Yeah-heh-heh!

01:24:09.541 --> 01:24:13.499
Look at you!
You're bulletproof. Ha ha!

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:15.082
Oh, I need a drink.

01:24:15.083 --> 01:24:17.915
Look at this!
Just what the doctor ordered.

01:24:17.916 --> 01:24:19.499
Okay,
I'll leave you to celebrate.

01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:21.332
Congratulations.

01:24:21.333 --> 01:24:23.583
Thanks, Chris.

01:24:28.208 --> 01:24:29.875
Knebworth.

01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:33.000
How does it feel?

01:24:34.916 --> 01:24:36.166
Crippling.

01:24:37.291 --> 01:24:39.208
It'll sink in.

01:24:40.583 --> 01:24:42.749
It's like someone's picked
sides for an after-school game

01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:44.165
and it's all gone
horribly, horribly wrong.

01:24:44.166 --> 01:24:45.375
I mean, it's...

01:24:47.041 --> 01:24:48.957
It's one against thousands.

01:24:48.958 --> 01:24:51.708
Bollocks!
The audience loves ya.

01:24:54.083 --> 01:24:55.333
I can't do it.

01:24:56.916 --> 01:24:59.332
I can't carry Knebworth.

01:24:59.333 --> 01:25:01.457
I'll be like a lamb to
the fucking slaughter, Dad.

01:25:01.458 --> 01:25:03.624
- It's just stage fright.
- You're not listening!

01:25:03.625 --> 01:25:06.833
No. It's normal. Okay?

01:25:07.791 --> 01:25:09.500
You know what's
always helped me?

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.790
A little bit of Dutch courage.

01:25:12.791 --> 01:25:15.166
Don't I know it.

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:20.499
Dad, I'm sorry. Dad!

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:23.333
No one buys a ticket to
hear your problems, son.

01:25:24.333 --> 01:25:26.916
You wanna know why
these people are gods?

01:25:28.416 --> 01:25:31.333
'Cause they make other
people's problems go away.

01:25:32.791 --> 01:25:35.458
Dad, Dad, stay. Please!

01:26:30.125 --> 01:26:31.957
Whoa!

01:26:38.791 --> 01:26:40.582
<i>My next guest
has been climbing the charts</i>

01:26:40.583 --> 01:26:42.082
<i>- and conquering the world.</i>
- Here he is!

01:26:42.083 --> 01:26:43.457
Ready? Here's daddy's best mate.

01:26:43.458 --> 01:26:44.915
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Robbie Williams!</i>

01:26:49.375 --> 01:26:51.124
<i>Well, this has been</i>

01:26:51.125 --> 01:26:53.999
a sudden change in
fortune for you, has it not?

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.790
I mean, you're flying high.

01:26:55.791 --> 01:26:57.207
Sober as a judge, Parky.

01:26:57.208 --> 01:26:58.540
Well, uh...

01:26:58.541 --> 01:27:00.874
Sorry, sorry, I have to do this.

01:27:00.875 --> 01:27:02.207
Ooh!

01:27:02.208 --> 01:27:03.915
Look, Nan, it's Parky!

01:27:05.041 --> 01:27:08.915
Oh, Betty!
It's Robert.

01:27:08.916 --> 01:27:10.415
<i>Let's talk if we may</i>

01:27:10.416 --> 01:27:11.874
<i>about this success
you've been having.</i>

01:27:11.875 --> 01:27:13.290
<i>I mean, it's not
the first time,</i>

01:27:13.291 --> 01:27:14.415
is it?

01:27:14.416 --> 01:27:16.249
You've had it before
with Take That.

01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:18.915
Would you say that this is
a different kind of success?

01:27:18.916 --> 01:27:21.165
It means a great deal
more to me now.

01:27:21.166 --> 01:27:23.207
I'm about to perform
in front of a record crowd

01:27:23.208 --> 01:27:24.957
at Knebworth in a few weeks.

01:27:24.958 --> 01:27:28.999
No, no, stop it. It's nothing.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.207
It's only the biggest music
event in British history!

01:27:33.708 --> 01:27:35.332
That's my boy.

01:27:35.333 --> 01:27:37.915
But, of course, Knebworth
is not the only record

01:27:37.916 --> 01:27:39.457
you've broken recently, is it?

01:27:39.458 --> 01:27:42.915
There's the matter of
your new deal with EMI -

01:27:42.916 --> 01:27:44.707
eighty million pounds.

01:27:44.708 --> 01:27:47.250
<i>- How does that feel?</i>
-  <i>Ah, I don't know.</i>

01:27:48.375 --> 01:27:51.415
I'm rich beyond
my wildest dreams!

01:27:51.416 --> 01:27:53.582
<i>I thought
I was quoting that lady</i>

01:27:53.583 --> 01:27:55.082
<i>who famously
won the lottery.</i>

01:27:55.083 --> 01:27:57.957
<i>- But she said...
- Spend, spend, spend!</i>

01:27:57.958 --> 01:27:59.582
<i>So no one got it.</i>

01:27:59.583 --> 01:28:01.874
<i>Mind you, I've said
worse things in interviews.</i>

01:28:03.833 --> 01:28:06.540
How would you describe
your time with Take That?

01:28:06.541 --> 01:28:08.915
I was very fortunate
to be in Take That...

01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:11.249
...and four out of the five
Spice Girls.

01:28:11.250 --> 01:28:13.457
Posh said no, didn't she?

01:28:13.458 --> 01:28:17.249
Uh, now, you've connected
with many women in the past--

01:28:17.250 --> 01:28:19.874
Oh, we're going to talk
about my sex life.

01:28:19.875 --> 01:28:21.208
Well, I suppose...

01:28:22.208 --> 01:28:24.207
There's nothing to write
home about.

01:28:24.208 --> 01:28:26.290
Which is a shame 'cause Mum
loves getting those letters.

01:28:27.375 --> 01:28:28.624
Oh, I mean,

01:28:28.625 --> 01:28:30.499
how many flat tyres
can you have?

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:31.874
The second one...

01:28:31.875 --> 01:28:33.499
...we didn't even
get out of the car.

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:35.499
There was no way Natalie
was gonna ruin her hair,

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:37.082
so they just jacked it up
with us all inside.

01:28:37.083 --> 01:28:39.165
And the weather was--

01:28:39.166 --> 01:28:40.874
I'm just
popping to the loo.

01:28:40.875 --> 01:28:42.582
The weather
was horrendous.

01:28:42.583 --> 01:28:44.166
At least the sound was good.

01:28:45.083 --> 01:28:46.624
My voice was tired, though.

01:28:46.625 --> 01:28:48.415
Probably because
I wasn't sleeping.

01:28:48.416 --> 01:28:50.999
Which is weird because the bed
was insanely comfortable.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.500
I even got the name of the
mattress in case we wanted...

01:28:54.458 --> 01:28:56.250
<i>But you're
finally settling down?</i>

01:28:57.250 --> 01:28:58.915
<i>I have
to be a realist.</i>

01:28:58.916 --> 01:29:02.165
<i>You know, we're both
on tour a lot,</i>

01:29:02.166 --> 01:29:04.500
and it can be difficult,
you know.

01:29:27.250 --> 01:29:29.832
<i>So tell me, what's
it like for Robbie Williams</i>

01:29:29.833 --> 01:29:31.541
<i>to be in love?</i>

01:29:33.625 --> 01:29:35.333
Well, that's difficult too.

01:29:35.875 --> 01:29:37.375
Um...

01:29:39.416 --> 01:29:41.415
Flings are much easier.

01:29:50.416 --> 01:29:52.500
You make me feel
so small...

01:29:53.666 --> 01:29:55.333
...and I've hated you for it...

01:29:56.375 --> 01:29:58.583
...for making me feel so...

01:30:00.375 --> 01:30:01.916
...unnecessary.

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:11.041
The fucking awful
things you do...

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.458
I thought you couldn't help it.

01:30:21.958 --> 01:30:23.875
But you just don't want to.

01:30:27.833 --> 01:30:29.666
And I can't help you anymore.

01:30:48.625 --> 01:30:49.958
Rob?

01:30:57.958 --> 01:30:59.375
Rob?

01:31:01.791 --> 01:31:03.833
Rob, please say something.

01:31:05.958 --> 01:31:07.625
Baby...

01:31:16.125 --> 01:31:18.249
-  Nic, please!
- You're a fucking animal!

01:31:18.250 --> 01:31:20.415
Babe...
Babe, you need to calm down.

01:31:20.416 --> 01:31:22.291
Don't tell me
what I need.

01:31:23.375 --> 01:31:24.665
Listen...

01:31:24.666 --> 01:31:26.707
-  Get out!
-  I can fix it!

01:31:26.708 --> 01:31:28.124
You're too fucking late!

01:31:28.125 --> 01:31:31.040
But I love you!

01:31:47.125 --> 01:31:49.332
Easy!
Easy now. Come on.

01:31:49.333 --> 01:31:50.999
Briggsy...

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.082
Oh, what the fuck.

01:31:53.083 --> 01:31:54.915
- He's alright.
- Course I am!

01:31:54.916 --> 01:31:57.082
Shit!

01:31:57.083 --> 01:31:58.707
You should've said 'no'
to this one.

01:31:58.708 --> 01:32:00.249
To "Top of the Pops"?

01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:01.790
You can't buy
this kind of promotion.

01:32:01.791 --> 01:32:03.790
What's to promote?
Knebworth's sold out.

01:32:03.791 --> 01:32:05.040
The world tour.

01:32:05.041 --> 01:32:06.165
What, he just does Knebworth

01:32:06.166 --> 01:32:07.999
and then he pops his feet up,
does he?

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.499
You thought getting
to the top was hard.

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:11.707
Try staying there.

01:32:11.708 --> 01:32:14.124
-  On in five.
-  Come on, you're up.

01:32:16.833 --> 01:32:18.041
Leave it.

01:32:22.458 --> 01:32:24.457
Ooh, it's a woman!

01:32:24.458 --> 01:32:26.332
Hi, Mum, I'm about
to go on "Top..."

01:32:26.333 --> 01:32:27.874
<i>Where have you been?</i>

01:32:27.875 --> 01:32:29.915
<i>- I've been trying to reach you.</i>
- I know, I know, but listen.

01:32:29.916 --> 01:32:31.457
I'll have to talk to you
later, ducky head,

01:32:31.458 --> 01:32:33.457
because my pianist, well, he's
accidentally shat himself,

01:32:33.458 --> 01:32:35.040
and it's just a horror show.

01:32:35.041 --> 01:32:36.832
<i>It's your nan.</i>

01:32:36.833 --> 01:32:39.499
<i>She kept asking for ya.</i>

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:41.958
<i>I tried calling ya, but...</i>

01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:46.625
<i>I'm so sorry, love.
She's gone.</i>

01:32:50.875 --> 01:32:53.290
Come on, mate.
Let's go.

01:33:04.916 --> 01:33:08.332
<i>Whoever pulls
the sword out of the stone</i>

01:33:08.333 --> 01:33:11.082
gets to be
the new King of England.

01:33:11.083 --> 01:33:13.124
<i>He's here tonight to sing</i>

01:33:13.125 --> 01:33:15.957
<i>what has become the
unofficial national anthem.</i>

01:33:15.958 --> 01:33:19.582
<i>It's the song on everyone's
lips and in everyone's hearts.</i>

01:33:19.583 --> 01:33:23.207
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the ego has landed.</i>

01:33:23.208 --> 01:33:25.499
<i>So the
next thing you know,</i>

01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:27.957
<i>all the knights
are straining...</i>

01:33:31.250 --> 01:33:33.582
<i>...and turning red.</i>

01:33:33.583 --> 01:33:36.083
<i>But nobody could budge it.</i>

01:33:36.833 --> 01:33:38.374
<i>So you can imagine</i>

01:33:38.375 --> 01:33:39.790
how everyone laughed

01:33:39.791 --> 01:33:42.165
when little Arthur
stepped up for his turn.

01:33:42.166 --> 01:33:43.583
Everyone.

01:33:44.833 --> 01:33:47.124
<i>Except Merlin.</i>

01:33:47.125 --> 01:33:51.040
<i>Merlin just stroked his beard
and whispered,</i>

01:33:51.041 --> 01:33:52.999
<i>"Arthur,</i>

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.165

01:38:38.791 --> 01:38:40.125
Okay.

01:38:44.583 --> 01:38:46.082
Hey, we should get
the boys together.

01:38:46.083 --> 01:38:48.999
Hey? Have a little knees-up
before your concert tomorrow.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.415
It'd do you good.

01:38:50.416 --> 01:38:52.000
I can't face it.

01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:58.582
Zip me up.

01:38:58.583 --> 01:39:00.749
Fucking hell.
What time's lift-off?

01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:03.125
- It helps hide the fat.
- Oh, yeah.

01:39:05.875 --> 01:39:08.624
You've no idea what it
takes to get up there.

01:39:08.625 --> 01:39:10.582
I can't sleep.

01:39:10.583 --> 01:39:12.165
My back's fucked.

01:39:12.166 --> 01:39:14.832
Yeah, but once you're up there,
you're smashing it, so...

01:39:14.833 --> 01:39:17.458
See, that fucks me right off
when people say that.

01:39:21.916 --> 01:39:23.916
Being up there's the worst bit.

01:39:25.458 --> 01:39:28.165
Pays alright, though.

01:39:28.166 --> 01:39:29.999
Fuck.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.708
You don't understand.

01:39:39.958 --> 01:39:42.041
No, no,
I don't understand.

01:39:43.791 --> 01:39:45.875
But at least I'm trying.

01:39:46.875 --> 01:39:48.499
You know all I wanted

01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:51.291
was for you to ask me,
just once, how I'm doing.

01:39:52.583 --> 01:39:54.665
You know, with work
and my little girl or...

01:39:54.666 --> 01:39:56.249
I'm about to walk out

01:39:56.250 --> 01:40:01.124
to 125,000 people!

01:40:01.125 --> 01:40:04.582
You've got no fucking idea
what that feels like.

01:40:04.583 --> 01:40:06.957
Yeah, and you've no idea
that I earn in a month

01:40:06.958 --> 01:40:09.374
what you fucking
snort in a minute.

01:40:09.375 --> 01:40:11.165
Or... or... or that
Kayleigh's shacked up

01:40:11.166 --> 01:40:12.374
with some fucking butcher,

01:40:12.375 --> 01:40:14.040
and so I'm living in an estate

01:40:14.041 --> 01:40:15.540

fucking psychopaths!

01:40:15.541 --> 01:40:17.374
Or that I only get
to see my kid

01:40:17.375 --> 01:40:19.082
for two hours
every fortnight or--

01:40:19.083 --> 01:40:20.874
- So you need money?
-  Fucking hell!

01:40:20.875 --> 01:40:22.540
You know, jealousy
don't suit you, Nate.

01:40:22.541 --> 01:40:25.124
Jeal...
Are you fucking kidding?!

01:40:25.125 --> 01:40:27.499
Alright, yeah, I might
have close to fuck-all,

01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:30.999
but you,
you have fucking nothing!

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.582
And this coming from you -

01:40:33.583 --> 01:40:37.333
a nothing, nobody cunt!

01:40:38.375 --> 01:40:40.749
You know the difference
between me and you, Nate?

01:40:40.750 --> 01:40:43.040
It's not my money,
it's not your kid.

01:40:43.041 --> 01:40:45.999
It's the fact that
I had the fucking balls

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.500
to make something
of myself.

01:40:59.083 --> 01:41:00.582
Yeah.

01:41:00.583 --> 01:41:02.915
You bought a ticket
to the dream,

01:41:02.916 --> 01:41:05.875
and the dream came true, and...

01:41:06.833 --> 01:41:09.166
Yeah, fuck it, I am,
I'm jealous of that.

01:41:10.208 --> 01:41:12.333
But you can keep
the fucking rest.

Going by helicopter and all.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.500
Youth?

01:42:25.833 --> 01:42:28.625
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:42:38.166 --> 01:42:39.250

Youth!

01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:57.375
You bastard!
I thought you'd passed out.

01:42:58.375 --> 01:43:02.540
I have waited my whole life
for you to step up.

01:43:02.541 --> 01:43:06.999
And all it took was
booking the biggest concert

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.665
in British history.

01:43:08.666 --> 01:43:10.832
What are you going on about?

01:43:10.833 --> 01:43:12.374
When you left us--

01:43:12.375 --> 01:43:13.999
Where's all this coming from?

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.833
All those years, I thought
he's just sorting himself out.

01:43:20.833 --> 01:43:25.999
He'll miss me so much
and he'll come back.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.874
Yeah, and I did.

01:43:27.875 --> 01:43:29.333
Yeah.

01:43:31.125 --> 01:43:33.083
'Cause Nan made you.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.415
I didn't leave you with
nothing, though, did I?

01:43:39.416 --> 01:43:41.790
Where do you think
your talent comes from?

01:43:41.791 --> 01:43:43.040
Jesus Christ.

01:43:43.041 --> 01:43:44.790
You've forgotten how
fucking lucky you are,

01:43:44.791 --> 01:43:46.249
that's your problem.

01:43:46.250 --> 01:43:48.833
It's a privilege
to do what we do.

01:43:50.875 --> 01:43:52.499
What we do?

01:43:52.500 --> 01:43:54.915
You live in a caravan.

01:43:54.916 --> 01:43:57.832
You perform to fifteen
fucking people a night.

01:43:57.833 --> 01:44:00.415
And I love every second of it.

01:44:00.416 --> 01:44:02.499
And I don't need pills
to get me through.

01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:04.040
Fucking hell...

01:44:04.041 --> 01:44:06.082
Sure, I'd give anything
to play to a big crowd.

01:44:06.083 --> 01:44:07.707
Of course I would!

01:44:07.708 --> 01:44:09.707
But if I only ever played
to one person

01:44:09.708 --> 01:44:11.540
for the rest of my life,

01:44:11.541 --> 01:44:14.250
I'd be happy giving them
everything I've got.

01:44:16.041 --> 01:44:18.665
Unless that person
was me, though, right?

01:44:18.666 --> 01:44:22.250
Really?! Who's been cheering
you on from the wings, hey?

01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:27.207
Who was it who stopped ya
from ruining your career?

01:44:27.208 --> 01:44:29.082
There wouldn't be
a Robbie Williams

01:44:29.083 --> 01:44:31.291
if it wasn't for me.

01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:36.833
You've always been there
for Robbie Williams, Dad.

01:44:40.708 --> 01:44:43.333
Why couldn't you just
be there for Robert?

01:44:53.416 --> 01:44:56.458
You off to watch
the football, then, yeah?

01:44:58.291 --> 01:44:59.833
Nice one.

01:45:01.458 --> 01:45:04.083
I'll see you in six years!

01:45:06.250 --> 01:45:08.416
You don't have it.

01:45:10.166 --> 01:45:13.040

a father, not as anything!

They've come for me.

01:45:57.875 --> 01:46:00.291
And I'm going to die out there.

01:54:16.416 --> 01:54:19.291
The worst thing was
I lost the ability to care.

01:54:23.250 --> 01:54:25.250
You are next,

01:54:30.291 --> 01:54:32.625
I feel a bit stupid,
to be honest.

01:54:36.750 --> 01:54:39.375
I'm just a chav that got
everything they ever wanted.

01:54:42.166 --> 01:54:44.833
It's a bit fucking embarrassing,
to be frank.

01:54:48.083 --> 01:54:50.750
I was taught that fame
would solve everything.

01:54:53.416 --> 01:54:55.541
But fame's got fuck-all
to do with me.

01:54:56.541 --> 01:54:59.457
It's about acting out
everyone else's fantasies.

01:54:59.458 --> 01:55:03.832
The shagging, the boozing,
the showing your bollocks on TV

01:55:03.833 --> 01:55:05.833
and people cheering you for it.

01:55:06.958 --> 01:55:08.708
Fame looks good in a photo.

01:55:12.333 --> 01:55:16.000
They say your life freezes
at the age you become famous.

01:55:17.708 --> 01:55:19.666
So I am fifteen.

01:55:21.875 --> 01:55:23.541
I'm stunted.

01:55:25.291 --> 01:55:27.166
I'm unevolved.

01:55:29.583 --> 01:55:32.249
And that's why I'm always like,
"Oh, it's okay.

01:55:32.250 --> 01:55:34.624
"I think I'm a cunt.
I'm fine with it."

01:55:34.625 --> 01:55:37.041
So I get in there
before you do.

01:55:39.625 --> 01:55:42.708
And I fucking
hate myself for it.

01:55:48.375 --> 01:55:52.165
Sometimes it's a curse
to get everything we want.

01:55:52.166 --> 01:55:54.499
Repairing close relationships

01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:58.333
