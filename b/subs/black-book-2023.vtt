01:49.000 --> 01:51.708
Baby boy, what will not happen?!

01:51.791 --> 01:53.333
It's those SAKS people again.

01:53.416 --> 01:54.708
Should I turn on the Siren?

04:42.458 --> 04:44.041
Boss go, go, go! We are with him! Go!

05:30.000 --> 05:34.666
Sir! Sir, we're here.
Sir, there are a lot of us here.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.708
Sir.

05:38.583 --> 05:44.791
Sir, we're here. We're greeting you.
It's the boss we're talking to. Sir.

06:34.666 --> 06:37.500
You'll keep boasting from here on out.

08:41.166 --> 08:42.625
-Are you only buying akara?
-Yes.

08:42.708 --> 08:43.666
They will give him.

08:43.750 --> 08:46.750
Look at Uncle Paul passing by.

08:48.833 --> 08:51.500
My son told me what you did for him.

08:54.625 --> 08:56.750
-Bisi's mother.
-Thank you. Have a good day, okay?

08:56.833 --> 08:58.791
-Have a good day. God will bless you.
-Yeah, good morning.

09:50.375 --> 09:52.500
Paulo, my man. How are you?

09:52.583 --> 09:55.583
-What's going on?
-I'm just happy to see you.

10:05.166 --> 10:08.000
We got Ekene on line one.
Ekene good afternoon, how are you doing?

10:08.083 --> 10:11.541
Hi Sandra, what is the meaning
of this game the police is playing?

10:11.625 --> 10:13.958
If they want us to find the person,
they should give us a picture.

10:14.041 --> 10:17.500
What is all this
Nollywood description they're doing?

16:12.041 --> 16:13.416
Greetings.

16:16.166 --> 16:17.583
Yes, Your Excellency.

16:32.166 --> 16:33.625
Thank you, my boss.

16:43.375 --> 16:45.708
As Christians that we are,

16:47.083 --> 16:49.291
we often ask ourselves whether

16:50.541 --> 16:56.375
God can really forgive our past sins.

16:57.916 --> 16:59.375
We often ask ourselves.

17:00.583 --> 17:04.083
Because honestly, some of us here,

17:04.166 --> 17:08.041
have done some terrible things
before in our lives.

17:08.125 --> 17:11.291
We have all committed
grave sins in our lives.

17:12.750 --> 17:16.041
But the good news is that
this Bible that we read,

17:17.333 --> 17:21.916
it says, in Second Corinthians 5 verse 17…

17:26.500 --> 17:29.041
Baba Bernard, I am going to church.

17:29.125 --> 17:31.916
You too have started
going to church? We're thankful.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.583
Let my dad be a little happy.

17:34.958 --> 17:38.125
Everything you've done previously,

17:38.208 --> 17:41.000
God has done what? Thrown it away.

17:46.291 --> 17:49.541
It is like paper, a used paper,

17:49.625 --> 17:51.875
dirty paper that has been used, and torn

17:53.083 --> 17:54.000
and thrown away.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.916
Yahoo boys go to church?

18:49.166 --> 18:50.375
What is this?

18:51.000 --> 18:53.125
Do Yahoo boys now have ID cards?

18:53.625 --> 18:55.750
-Open that bag! What is in it?
-Give me my bag!

18:55.833 --> 18:57.333
Sir, what's wrong?
what is the matter, anyway?

18:57.416 --> 18:59.375
-Hey!
-You're an accomplice.

18:59.458 --> 19:01.583
-Ah! Officer, please.
-You're an accomplice.

19:01.666 --> 19:03.041
-What did he do?
-Leave this place!

19:03.125 --> 19:04.791
-Leave this place right now!
-Ah, please!

19:04.875 --> 19:06.833
-Enter the vehicle!
-Get inside the car! Move.

19:06.916 --> 19:08.916
Please, have mercy on me, please.

19:32.708 --> 19:34.375
Hey.

19:34.458 --> 19:35.666
Your father is a pastor?

19:39.166 --> 19:40.875
Ah-ah, what is the meaning of this?

19:40.958 --> 19:42.250
Leave me alone, please!

19:42.333 --> 19:43.708
You can't take my picture,
what's the meaning of that?

19:43.791 --> 19:45.333
You don't have the right
to take my picture.

19:57.375 --> 19:58.291
You're harassing me.

20:08.458 --> 20:11.166
You know your rights?
You want to teach me my job, right?

20:24.291 --> 20:25.625
-I’m not a Yahoo boy. Please sir.
-Turn around!

20:29.583 --> 20:31.958
Sir please, I'm begging you,
in the name of Jesus.

21:30.125 --> 21:32.458
If it's not that, what is--

24:49.958 --> 24:50.916
You remember we told you

24:51.000 --> 24:52.916
that we do not release
the bodies of criminals

24:57.416 --> 25:01.291
Sir, I beg. I beg you in God's name,
my child is innocent. I beg you.

25:07.666 --> 25:10.000
Please, my child is innocent.

25:11.958 --> 25:13.791
The family that your child kidnapped,

25:15.416 --> 25:16.708
do you think about them at all?

28:51.541 --> 28:54.250
Madam Vic, this case is very sensitive.

28:54.333 --> 28:55.958
There's nothing I can do.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.750
Sir Eagle please,

29:19.666 --> 29:22.583
Sir, we told you to follow due process.

29:25.208 --> 29:26.750
but your people are frustrating me.

29:26.833 --> 29:28.875
What is this you're eating?

29:28.958 --> 29:30.833
-This is amala.
-Remove your hand.

29:32.708 --> 29:35.250
-Please give me the file.
-Let me eat some.

29:39.166 --> 29:41.000
Didn't I tell you
not to come back here again?

29:50.666 --> 29:53.375
Who is that?! What is going on here?

29:54.000 --> 29:55.375
-Sir, you again?
-You again?

29:57.208 --> 29:59.041
Go outside! Don't come
and destroy things in this office.

30:02.708 --> 30:05.291
-You father of a kidnapper.
-Sir, move. What is your problem?

30:10.375 --> 30:11.750
-Useless man.
-Coming to fight in our office.

30:11.833 --> 30:12.958
-You'll see what will happen to you.
-Move!

30:23.000 --> 30:25.125
Sir, there's no time.

30:25.208 --> 30:26.041
Madam, have patience.

30:43.791 --> 30:45.083
Oh, baby. Fine girl.

30:45.166 --> 30:46.458
-Oh, baby. Hello.
-Fine girl.

30:46.541 --> 30:47.375
-Hello!
-How are you?

30:47.458 --> 30:50.333
-Come here!
-Fine girl, how are you?

30:52.708 --> 30:53.833
Officer, we're hungry, we want to eat.

30:53.916 --> 30:56.166
May hunger kill you!

30:56.875 --> 30:58.583
Bring that girl, let's look at her face.

32:05.250 --> 32:07.291
-Fine girl, wait!
-Oh, baby!

32:07.375 --> 32:09.250
-Come!
-Oh, baby, wait!

32:10.416 --> 32:15.416
Officer, please water!

38:23.708 --> 38:24.958
Tell me if you see him.

40:06.083 --> 40:08.041
What do you want?

42:10.541 --> 42:13.666
SPEAK UP

42:13.750 --> 42:16.958
GET ANGRY FREELY

44:50.708 --> 44:52.875
Wait, wait! It was a rich man's kid.

46:45.916 --> 46:47.750
The debt he owes me is a lot.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.416
And I will collect.

48:49.708 --> 48:50.625
You think about it.

48:57.291 --> 48:58.958
You'd better, Mr. Man.

59:31.916 --> 59:33.500
Do you still sleep around?

01:08:04.916 --> 01:08:05.875
-Thank you, sir.
-Bye.

01:09:20.541 --> 01:09:22.083
Take it easy.

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:38.166
What is all this rubbish

01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:39.458
that you throw all around the place?

01:11:40.333 --> 01:11:42.583
Take all this rubbish away
from the front of my shop right now.

01:11:42.666 --> 01:11:45.500
Stop disrupting my sales
with your rubbish.

01:11:45.583 --> 01:11:46.541
Good morning.

01:11:47.833 --> 01:11:48.791
Good morning.

01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:05.875
Look here, it's too early for this.

01:12:32.208 --> 01:12:35.208
Alright, come. Well done.

01:16:20.416 --> 01:16:21.250
It can't be so.

01:17:22.166 --> 01:17:23.125
Shut up!

01:18:22.333 --> 01:18:24.458
Deputy, how are you?

01:18:59.208 --> 01:19:01.833
Yes he did.
The boy was as slippery as a snail.

01:19:01.916 --> 01:19:03.625
-Slippery like a snail.
-Wow.

01:19:09.041 --> 01:19:11.625
Osaretin, uh, before you go, please come.

01:29:07.291 --> 01:29:08.333
A life for a life.

01:34:30.208 --> 01:34:31.041
That's it.

01:35:47.875 --> 01:35:49.791
Code red.

01:37:06.333 --> 01:37:08.875
Big Daddy,
how are you doing? Welcome.

01:37:13.458 --> 01:37:15.833
Greetings. Are you all good?

01:37:19.291 --> 01:37:20.916
-Ah, greetings to you all.
-Thanks.

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:54.750
-Hands up!
-Hey!

01:44:05.916 --> 01:44:06.958
That's it?

01:46:16.875 --> 01:46:18.000
Baraka, how are we doing?

01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:21.541
A little more time.

01:48:19.583 --> 01:48:22.000
No way! You are mining
illegally under the cover of herdsmen.

01:48:22.666 --> 01:48:24.458
You will not get away with it!

01:49:33.125 --> 01:49:34.625
-Are they coming?
-Yes.

01:49:34.708 --> 01:49:35.916
-Are they coming?
-Yes!

01:51:09.041 --> 01:51:10.250
Is this man crazy?

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.916
