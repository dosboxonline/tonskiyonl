Besides,

50:38.327 --> 50:41.456

50:41.539 --> 50:44.459
so maybe if I'm gone,
he'll leave you be.

Don't you leave him.

50:54.218 --> 50:56.345
it ain't my job
to look after you.

50:56.429 --> 50:59.348
Don't be such a fucking poof
all your life.

51:10.693 --> 51:11.694
Right.

51:15.907 --> 51:17.366
Please,

51:17.450 --> 51:18.868
don't go.

51:46.979 --> 51:48.856
You served me up to him
on a plate.

51:50.399 --> 51:51.317
No, I...

51:51.400 --> 51:52.819
I didn't.

51:59.325 --> 52:00.827
Len, I-I'm sorry, but they...

52:00.910 --> 52:03.704
they just wouldn't let me out
of the barracks.

52:11.087 --> 52:13.005
Oh, Jesus, please.

52:13.089 --> 52:14.757
- Please, fuck, no.
- He's beating the living shit

52:14.841 --> 52:15.758

52:15.842 --> 52:17.635
Day in and day out.

52:17.718 --> 52:20.221
- I can't take no more.
- Please, Len, don't.

52:20.304 --> 52:23.349
You fucking knew what he'd do.
It's your fault.

52:23.432 --> 52:25.685
No, don't say that.
That's... that's not true.
