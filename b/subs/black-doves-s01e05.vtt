[door buzzes]

10:34.708 --> 10:35.999
[Williams groans]

10:36.000 --> 10:36.916

10:38.000 --> 10:41.207
- [door closes]
- [footsteps approach]

10:41.208 --> 10:42.166
Michael.

10:43.583 --> 10:44.750
Um...

10:45.625 --> 10:48.500
- No. No. Absolutely not, Sam.
- [Sam] Please. Please.

10:55.333 --> 10:57.749
- Can you take your shoes off, please? Yes.
- My shoes, yes.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.666
- Can you take your shoes off?
- Yeah.

11:00.666 --> 11:01.541
Shoes off.

11:03.541 --> 11:06.749
I know that this is the last thing
you want, and I am so, so sorry.

11:06.750 --> 11:07.875
[Michael] Who are they?

11:09.083 --> 11:10.749
Um, that's Cole.

11:10.750 --> 11:12.957
He's, um, a CIA agent.

11:12.958 --> 11:14.540
A CIA agent?

11:14.541 --> 11:17.332
Yeah. Well, TBC, actually.
He might be defecting.

11:17.333 --> 11:18.582
It's not really clear.

11:18.583 --> 11:22.541
- And the blonde girl is Williams.
- Right. And is she in the CIA?

11:23.125 --> 11:24.000
No, she...

11:24.833 --> 11:26.166
What? A triggerman? Woman?

11:26.791 --> 11:28.874
Triggerman. It's gender non-specific.

11:28.875 --> 11:32.249
When I said you could come, I didn't mean
bring the whole fucking rogues' gallery.

11:32.250 --> 11:36.124
I know, I know, I know. And I am so sorry.
And when I got that message, I felt...

11:36.125 --> 11:37.249
[man chatters on TV]

11:37.250 --> 11:38.165
- [Sam sighs]
- What?

11:38.166 --> 11:40.040
[man] <i>According to reports,</i>
a <i>number of people...</i>

11:40.041 --> 11:41.124
Happy.

11:41.125 --> 11:43.457
<i>...were seen leaving the building
after the fire started.</i>

11:43.458 --> 11:44.375
And I'm...

11:46.083 --> 11:49.791
- I wouldn't be here if I wasn't desperate.
- Oh, just what every boy wants to hear.

11:52.041 --> 11:52.915
[Williams groans]

11:52.916 --> 11:56.332
"Fireball engulfs London property.
Gunshots reported."

11:56.333 --> 11:58.457
- [man] <i>...residential block.</i>
- Is that you?

11:58.458 --> 11:59.833
[chatter on TV continues]

12:01.000 --> 12:01.916
No.

12:03.375 --> 12:05.665
My daughter is asleep in the next room.

12:05.666 --> 12:09.707
So whatever this is, it cannot be here.
You cannot bring it here.

12:09.708 --> 12:11.999
- We weren't followed.
- [Williams groans]

12:12.000 --> 12:14.665
I saw you in the newspaper a while back,
and I thought,

12:14.666 --> 12:17.624
"Oh, look, there's that woman
who I saw murder someone in the street."

12:17.625 --> 12:20.749
- "Isn't she doing well?"
- If I hadn't done that, you'd be dead.

12:20.750 --> 12:24.707
Michael, I promise
that no one is coming here.

12:24.708 --> 12:26.374
Your daughter is completely safe.

12:26.375 --> 12:29.249
Think very carefully before you make
a promise to me that you can't keep.

12:29.250 --> 12:31.290
[man] <i>...the blaze started,
and also some accounts...</i>

12:31.291 --> 12:33.249
I promise you,
your daughter's gonna be safe.

12:33.250 --> 12:34.208
[Williams groans]

12:35.833 --> 12:38.832
- Is she dying?
- No, don't worry about me. I'm grand.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.415
We think she got shot,
but she's being very coy about it.

12:41.416 --> 12:44.082
- I... I don't like to make a fuss.
- [Michael] Right, okay.

12:44.083 --> 12:45.165
I saw once in a film

12:45.166 --> 12:49.040
that someone put sanitary pads
on a gunshot wound for the blood. I...

12:49.041 --> 12:50.999
[man] <i>...seen increased violence
across the city.</i>

12:51.000 --> 12:53.290
My friend Faz stayed over last week
and left some.

12:53.291 --> 12:55.957
Just get me some bandages
and hot water for now,

12:55.958 --> 12:59.165
but if I do get the strong urge
to suture myself with a fanny pad,

12:59.166 --> 13:00.457
I'll let you know.

13:00.458 --> 13:01.916
- [cell phone buzzes]
- Okay.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.166

is liable to change at any time.</i>

[Helen] What do you want?

13:22.250 --> 13:24.499
[man 2] <i>What we've been wanting
from the start.</i>

13:24.500 --> 13:27.832
<i>A digital recording device taken
from the ambassador's daughter's flat</i>...

13:27.833 --> 13:30.124
- [Eleanor] <i>Such a bastard.
-</i> ...<i>on the night that he died.</i>

13:30.125 --> 13:32.416
- [water running]
- [Helen] I've told you, I don't have it.

if you are someone we can trust.</i>

<i>if you haven't handed it over
by midday tomorrow,</i>

13:41.458 --> 13:46.082
<i>we will kill all of your friends
in ways so absurdly cruel</i>

13:46.083 --> 13:50.832
<i>that the manner of their passing
will haunt you until your own dying day.</i>

13:50.833 --> 13:53.124
We do not have your fucking recorder.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.458

for sure by tomorrow.</i>

13:55.958 --> 13:58.541

13:59.041 --> 14:03.250
<i>Hand it over to one of my associates,

14:09.458 --> 14:11.332
- [line clicks]
- [tense music plays]

14:11.333 --> 14:13.583
Do you have any idea
where this fucking recorder is?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.040
Okay, we know
that it's not in Jason's apartment.

14:17.041 --> 14:19.832
I mean, we can assume that
it's not in Maggie and Phillip's either,

14:19.833 --> 14:21.624
but they've hidden it somewhere.

14:21.625 --> 14:24.040
We'd have to go back
and retrace their steps,

14:24.041 --> 14:26.165
but where would you even start?

14:26.166 --> 14:29.000
[Helen] We are not gonna find this device
in time for tomorrow.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.374
Unless I can get in a room
with Alex Clark,

14:31.375 --> 14:32.790
they'll kill Kai-Ming and Eleanor,

14:32.791 --> 14:35.041
and I will never find out
the truth about Jason.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.833
We need to get her to that meeting.

14:38.375 --> 14:40.708
Cole, is there any way
that you can get to Trent?

14:41.208 --> 14:43.791
Not to, like,
make it all about me, but, um,

14:45.000 --> 14:46.333
what's in it for me?

14:49.916 --> 14:51.375
Okay, um,

14:52.416 --> 14:54.165
I am going to do my very best

14:54.166 --> 14:57.165
to stop the people that I work for
from hurting your family,

14:57.166 --> 14:59.374
but I do think
there's one thing you need to consider.

14:59.375 --> 15:02.582
If you can't get us Trent,
then we don't need you.

15:02.583 --> 15:03.957
And if we don't need you,

15:03.958 --> 15:06.665
then I'm gonna get Sam here
to march you to Hampstead Heath

15:06.666 --> 15:08.540
and shoot you in the back of the head.

15:08.541 --> 15:09.583
[Williams chuckles]

15:11.333 --> 15:12.999
- Is that true?

15:46.375 --> 15:47.208
All right?

15:51.708 --> 15:54.000
He's never gonna talk to me again
after tonight, is he?

15:56.041 --> 15:57.416
You told him what you do?

15:58.375 --> 15:59.208
Yeah.

16:11.416 --> 16:12.625
[softly] I told Jason.

16:13.291 --> 16:15.208
- Helen.
- I know, I know. I...

16:16.291 --> 16:18.250
- [Sam] What did you tell him?
- Oh, I kept it vague.

16:18.750 --> 16:20.875
- [Sam] Vague?
- Opaque, you know? I to...

16:23.750 --> 16:26.999
I told him
that I wasn't who he thought I was

16:27.000 --> 16:29.750
and that Helen Webb didn't exist.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.957
That doesn't sound that opaque.

[somber music playing]

16:34.583 --> 16:35.416
I...

16:37.708 --> 16:39.625
I told him what I needed to tell him.

16:43.250 --> 16:45.415
That you work for an organization

16:45.416 --> 16:48.375
that steals secrets from the government
that he works for?

16:50.125 --> 16:50.958
Yes.

16:54.125 --> 16:56.290
[Sam] And what did he say?
How did he react?

17:14.666 --> 17:15.958
[somber music continues]

17:17.250 --> 17:18.541
That's a nice reaction.

17:19.500 --> 17:20.333
Yeah.

17:25.291 --> 17:26.791
He was dead a week later.

17:28.375 --> 17:29.666
I have to find out why.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.291
And I have to find out who he was.

You do what you have to do.

Listen. Find Trent.

18:07.125 --> 18:09.665
Right? He's the only leverage
we've got to get to Alex Clark.

18:09.666 --> 18:11.665
- Got it.
- [Helen] Reed will be on the warpath.

18:11.666 --> 18:13.000
So watch Cole.

- You have to make your Christmas wish.
- [Helen] I'm in time?

- Just in time.
- You have to think it. You can't say it.

Okay. Right, yes. It's got to be a secret.

There you go. Hello, hello.

I was doing the Christmas shopping.
Where were you?

19:28.208 --> 19:30.665
Oh, we had a big problem
at the US embassy earlier, so...

19:30.666 --> 19:31.707
Go on, squeeze it.

19:31.708 --> 19:34.875
Oh, okay.
Well, that beats my shopping excuse.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.207
Is everything okay? That sounds serious.

19:37.208 --> 19:39.207
No, we had to have
a big emergency meeting.

I thought you were here, so, um...

19:40.916 --> 19:43.124
Mum, make the wish.

19:43.125 --> 19:45.749
- [Oli] You have to stir it.
- [Helen] Right, I'm stirring it.

- And also, you have to close your eyes.
- Close my eyes. Okay.

just look so yummy?

- [Jason] <i>You can tell me anything.</i>

like me as much after.</i>

Did you do it?

20:03.541 --> 20:04.790
[chuckles] Right.

20:04.791 --> 20:07.499
Right, guys. It is incredibly late.
It's time to get ready for bed.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.082
- Would you, uh...
- But what did you wish for?

20:10.083 --> 20:12.249
Well, I'm not gonna tell you.
It's a secret.

20:12.250 --> 20:15.290
Get ready for bed,
and I will be up there in a minute.

[music continues in background]

What did you buy?

20:40.625 --> 20:41.583
What?

20:43.416 --> 20:45.500
- The Christmas shopping.
- [Helen] Well, it was, um...

20:46.375 --> 20:49.583
It was a present for you,
so I can't tell you. [chuckles awkwardly]

20:50.958 --> 20:51.916
What's going on?

20:55.583 --> 20:57.375
You ever think about
that first night we met?

- Yeah, sometimes.
- [Wallace] I do, quite often.

21:03.416 --> 21:05.999

I play it around in my head.

and getting dressed and... leaving

21:11.125 --> 21:12.708
and walking to the lift.

21:14.666 --> 21:16.500
How far out of the hotel did you go?

21:17.000 --> 21:17.833
[scoffs]

21:19.416 --> 21:21.666
- What does it matter?
- [Wallace] 'Cause it matters.

21:22.500 --> 21:25.166
- I wanna know what you were thinking.
- [Helen] What was I thinking?

21:26.000 --> 21:27.790
Oh, you know, I was probably thinking, um,

21:27.791 --> 21:30.415
"I don't have money for a cab,
and it's 3:00 a.m."

21:30.416 --> 21:31.500
- Yeah?
- [Helen] Yeah.

21:33.916 --> 21:35.208
No, I was...

21:37.291 --> 21:38.416
I was thinking that I...

21:39.166 --> 21:41.083
I didn't want to go, actually.
I wanted to stay.

21:44.041 --> 21:45.333
[shakily] Are you happy?

21:46.708 --> 21:48.750
Like, with me? And with us?

21:49.291 --> 21:51.540
Wow. Yes, Wallace. What's going on?

21:51.541 --> 21:55.415
I know there are... lots of ways
that I probably disappoint you.

21:55.416 --> 21:57.749
- You do not disappoint me.
- [Wallace] Oh, come on.

21:57.750 --> 22:00.000
That's the mistake you always make.
You always do that.

22:01.333 --> 22:04.083
You insist that there are no problems,
but no one's flawless, Hels.

22:04.958 --> 22:07.125
No one knows
everything about someone, do they?

22:08.750 --> 22:11.207
You're always acting
as though everything's perfect,

22:11.208 --> 22:12.750
as though we're perfect, but

22:14.083 --> 22:15.457
that's a lie, isn't it?

22:15.458 --> 22:16.708
It's an impossible lie.

22:18.166 --> 22:21.333
So who are you telling that to?
Me? You? Or...?

22:21.833 --> 22:23.291
[somber organ music plays]

22:26.791 --> 22:28.583
It's just the way I feel. [sighs]

22:32.916 --> 22:34.333
Anything you want to tell me?

22:36.583 --> 22:37.416
Like what?

22:39.916 --> 22:40.916
Just anything?

22:44.166 --> 22:45.000
No.

22:46.083 --> 22:46.916
Look,

22:47.875 --> 22:49.708
I don't think you're perfect,

22:50.208 --> 22:51.165
believe me,

22:51.166 --> 22:53.708
and I do not think
that we are perfect, but

22:55.166 --> 22:56.832
I'm... I'm trying to be supportive.

22:56.833 --> 22:59.915
- I'm... I'm trying to make things nice.
- [knocking on door]

22:59.916 --> 23:01.041
[sighs]

23:02.041 --> 23:03.375
Are you expecting someone?

23:05.541 --> 23:06.375
No.

23:16.541 --> 23:18.499
- [Wallace] Perryman.
- [Perryman] Defence Secretary.

23:18.500 --> 23:20.583
I'm sorry,
would it be possible to come in?

23:21.083 --> 23:22.790
- [Wallace] Come in.
- [Perryman] Thank you.

23:22.791 --> 23:25.374
- [Wallace] Everything all right?
- [Perryman] Is it through here?

23:25.375 --> 23:26.625
[Wallace] Go through, yeah.

23:27.875 --> 23:29.207
- [Helen] Hi. Hello.
- Good evening.

23:29.208 --> 23:32.332
Sorry, this is Helen, my wife.
Helen, this is Officer Perryman.

23:32.333 --> 23:33.332
He's with MI5.

23:33.333 --> 23:35.957
- Forgive me for the intrusion, Mrs. Webb.
- [Helen] Not at all.

23:35.958 --> 23:37.208
What can I help you with?

23:37.708 --> 23:41.707
It's Mrs. Webb that we wanted to speak to.
Um, nothing to be alarmed about.

23:41.708 --> 23:45.874
Nothing at all. Um, I don't know
if you've spoken to Mrs. Webb about...

23:45.875 --> 23:48.124
[Wallace] I've told her
a bit about the embassy.

23:48.125 --> 23:52.125
Right. Well, then I'm sure
you can guess why I'm here, Helen.

23:53.125 --> 23:54.165
Oh my God. I was there.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.290
- [Perryman] Yeah.
- Were you?

23:55.291 --> 23:57.290
Yeah. Sorry.
It completely slipped my mind.

23:57.291 --> 23:59.749
We were doing the Christmas pudding
and the nanny...

23:59.750 --> 24:01.999
- Yes, I was there this afternoon.
- At the embassy today?

24:02.000 --> 24:05.040
Yeah, I was visiting lovely Vanessa.
You remember? She's--

24:05.041 --> 24:09.500
She said that she checked you in at 4:43.
We've checked the visitor's log for that.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.415
You were having a cup of coffee,
and then that was cut short

24:12.416 --> 24:13.665
when she took a phone call,

24:13.666 --> 24:15.790
and the phone call
was from an untraceable number,

24:15.791 --> 24:19.333
but apparently, it was something
about, um, a security detail for her?

24:19.916 --> 24:22.082
Right. We--
I mean, she didn't say what it was about.

24:22.083 --> 24:25.040
[Perryman] Then the building's
alarm system went off, and then you left?

24:25.041 --> 24:26.208
Yeah, yeah.

24:28.791 --> 24:30.708
What was the reason
for the visit to Ms. Robinson?

24:32.875 --> 24:34.000
Well, we were just...

24:34.666 --> 24:37.124
- Sorry, am I in sort of--
- [Perryman] God, no. Forgive me.

24:37.125 --> 24:40.999
Um, it's just that obviously your name
has, uh, set off a flag somewhere,

24:41.000 --> 24:43.374
so I thought that I'd pop down
and make a house call.

24:43.375 --> 24:44.832
You know, very relaxed,

24:44.833 --> 24:46.500
no stress, friendly face.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.666
- Dot the i's, you know?
- [Wallace] Sure.

24:49.208 --> 24:53.832
Yeah, I... I... I don't think I saw anything
that would be helpful. I'm so sorry.

24:53.833 --> 24:55.915
- Right, of course. No problem.
- [Jacqueline] Mum!

24:55.916 --> 24:57.832
- Oh, I need to...
- [Perryman] Of course.

24:57.833 --> 24:59.540
- Is that all right?
- [Perryman] Of course.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.124
Apologies again for the intrusion.

25:01.125 --> 25:02.415
- [Oli] Mum!
- [Helen] Oh sure.

25:02.416 --> 25:04.332
- [Perryman] Merry Christmas.
- And you. Thanks.

25:04.333 --> 25:06.749
[somber organ music continues]

25:06.750 --> 25:09.707
- I'll show you out. Thanks for coming.
- [Perryman] Yeah, sorry about that.

25:09.708 --> 25:12.374
- No, you've got to do what you've...
- Good to get it done.

25:12.375 --> 25:14.833
Sure we'll get to the bottom of it. Okay?

25:15.625 --> 25:16.500
See you soon.

25:33.541 --> 25:36.458
[Helen] "Stick Man is lonely.
Stick Man is lost."

25:37.166 --> 25:39.750
"Stick Man is frozen
and covered in frost."

25:40.375 --> 25:43.625
"Stick Man is weary.
His eyes start to close."

25:44.500 --> 25:46.583
"He stretches and yawns

25:47.333 --> 25:49.416
and lies down for a doze."

25:53.708 --> 25:55.875
[cell phone buzzing]

26:03.625 --> 26:04.625
[Helen] Wallace, uh...

26:05.958 --> 26:08.041
Gotta go out. Sorry.

26:09.291 --> 26:11.790
- I need to pick up a... a present.
- It's okay. It's fine.

26:11.791 --> 26:13.416
[breathes deeply]

26:15.125 --> 26:16.333
Uh, the kids are asleep.

26:17.333 --> 26:18.208
I love you.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.250
I love you.

26:21.666 --> 26:22.500
I always have.

26:23.208 --> 26:24.041
Hopelessly.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.457
Since the night we met in that hotel.
Since you came back.

26:27.458 --> 26:30.124
I was just so fucking relieved
that you did.

26:30.125 --> 26:31.375
[gentle music plays]

26:32.291 --> 26:34.582
And I know I'm not a complicated man,
Helen. I know that.

26:34.583 --> 26:36.750
And I know that's not
an attractive quality for you.

26:37.375 --> 26:39.041
But I love you.

26:41.375 --> 26:44.583
And I love our home
and our kids and our life.

26:45.541 --> 26:46.416
I love it.

26:48.833 --> 26:50.958
And you fight for what you love,
don't you?

26:52.458 --> 26:53.750
[gentle music continues]

26:55.833 --> 26:56.791
[inhales deeply]

26:58.125 --> 26:59.000
[clicks tongue]

26:59.625 --> 27:00.583
I won't be late.

27:04.666 --> 27:05.625
[music fades]

27:09.166 --> 27:11.166
["We Wish You a Merry Christmas" plays]

27:29.375 --> 27:31.875
[shoppers chattering indistinctly]

27:35.333 --> 27:37.333
[Christmas music continues]

27:52.666 --> 27:54.833
I've been trying to work out

27:56.291 --> 27:58.333
why you would do what you did tonight.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.750
If you wanted to threaten Cole Atwood,

28:02.833 --> 28:04.415
why didn't you just tell me?

28:04.416 --> 28:08.124
Some of us get harder as we get older,
and some of us get soft.

28:08.125 --> 28:09.374
You think I've gone soft?

28:09.375 --> 28:12.499
I think you feel more comfortable
with the carrot than the stick.

28:12.500 --> 28:13.416
[Helen scoffs]

28:15.708 --> 28:17.999
[inhales sharply]
So you're working for the Chinese?

28:18.000 --> 28:21.415
We are working for the highest bidder,
as we always do.

28:21.416 --> 28:24.250
An MI5 agent came to my house just now.

28:24.958 --> 28:27.166
He was asking
what I was doing at the embassy.

28:27.958 --> 28:32.666
I'm risking everything for you.
I have been risking everything for years.

28:33.291 --> 28:34.874
You still can't be honest with me.

28:34.875 --> 28:37.041
And now I think
Wallace suspects something.

28:37.541 --> 28:40.166
- You need to hand Cole over.
- [Helen] Why should I?

28:40.791 --> 28:43.207
Look, the Chinese
have gotten themselves into a corner.

28:43.208 --> 28:45.582
They've made threats,
and if they don't get what they want,

28:45.583 --> 28:47.540
they might have to start
going through with them,

28:47.541 --> 28:50.708
which, believe me...
we do not want to happen.

28:53.250 --> 28:56.625
What can you tell me
about an organization called the Clarks?

29:02.583 --> 29:04.375
It's a criminal conglomerate.

29:05.041 --> 29:07.541
Started out here,
expanded internationally.

29:08.208 --> 29:10.082
Aspirations of legitimacy.

29:10.083 --> 29:13.333
City trader pockets,
Mexican cartel body count.

29:14.833 --> 29:16.208
Yes, they're a nasty bunch.

29:17.541 --> 29:19.000
Never really dealt with them.

29:19.666 --> 29:20.875
They killed Jason

29:21.875 --> 29:23.999
and Maggie, and Phillip,
and Commissioner Yarrick,

29:24.000 --> 29:26.457
and quite possibly
the Chinese ambassador as well.

29:26.458 --> 29:28.375
- Busy week for them.
- Mm.

29:29.416 --> 29:31.708
They're the ones
looking for this recording device.

29:32.291 --> 29:34.791
We think that it shows
who killed Ambassador Chen.

29:36.708 --> 29:38.040
Do you know where it is?

29:38.041 --> 29:40.457
And I suppose if I did,
you'd want me to give it to you.

29:40.458 --> 29:41.707
Yes, of course I bloody would.

29:41.708 --> 29:44.874
- What are you gonna do about the Clarks?
- [Reed] Christ. I'll make some calls.

29:44.875 --> 29:47.332
- You'll make some calls?
- If you start cooperating, yes.

29:47.333 --> 29:49.249
- Not good enough.
- [Reed] It's gonna have to be.

29:49.250 --> 29:50.833
They murdered Jason.

29:51.416 --> 29:52.582
They sent a man to my house.

29:52.583 --> 29:54.624
- He threatened my children.
- And you killed him.

29:54.625 --> 29:56.582
And I'm going to kill
the people who sent him.

29:56.583 --> 29:57.540
Will you listen to me?

29:57.541 --> 30:00.040
Will you just, for once,
actually use your ears

30:00.041 --> 30:02.290
and your brain and listen
to what I'm trying to tell you?

30:02.291 --> 30:04.999
You cannot take down
an organization like the Clarks.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.124
You may as well try and take down
Mossad or HSBC or McDonald's.

30:08.125 --> 30:10.250
The people at the top
are too well-insulated.

30:11.833 --> 30:13.708
I looked into Jason, you know.

30:15.333 --> 30:16.165
And?

30:16.166 --> 30:18.207
He just had a boring,
easily traceable life

30:18.208 --> 30:19.874
that raised no red flags.

30:19.875 --> 30:22.958
Right up until he got mixed up
in the murder of a Chinese diplomat.

30:23.458 --> 30:25.832
- [somber music plays]
- What are you trying to say?

30:25.833 --> 30:28.749
I'm saying, I don't think
MI5 are making house calls

30:28.750 --> 30:31.333
to everyone that happened to be
in the embassy today.

30:32.041 --> 30:34.707
Perhaps Jason Davies
was not someone worth avenging,

30:34.708 --> 30:36.790
certainly not someone worth dying for.

30:36.791 --> 30:38.333
[Helen breathes shakily]

30:40.666 --> 30:42.958
What did Jason know about you, Helen?

30:45.416 --> 30:47.083
I already told you. Nothing.

30:49.208 --> 30:51.499
There are many rules in the Black Doves.

30:51.500 --> 30:55.000
But there is one above all others
that cannot be broken.

30:55.916 --> 31:00.165
The rule that we maintain the sanctity
and secrecy of our organization.

31:00.166 --> 31:04.458
The breaking of that rule is not punished
by banishment or expulsion.

31:05.625 --> 31:07.208
It is punished by death.

31:08.541 --> 31:11.249
Now, you are going to
hand over Cole Atwood to me

31:11.250 --> 31:14.625
at 6:30 tomorrow morning
on the Albert Embankment.

31:15.125 --> 31:17.582
And then you're going to go back
to doing what you do best,

31:17.583 --> 31:19.416
Helen Webb, wife and mother.

31:20.041 --> 31:21.290
And if you can't do that,

31:21.291 --> 31:24.166
and I'm certainly starting to worry
that you can't,

31:24.708 --> 31:27.208
then our arrangement
becomes null and void.

31:28.625 --> 31:30.625
Do you remember our first conversation?

31:31.916 --> 31:33.707
I still know all the exits.

31:33.708 --> 31:35.416
I still have a plan.

31:36.208 --> 31:39.666
And my hand is still a fist in my pocket,
ready to swing.

31:40.166 --> 31:41.375
[somber music continues]

31:46.708 --> 31:48.791
There aren't always exits, Helen.

31:50.708 --> 31:54.083
[Cole] Yes, I've tried that.
Okay, thanks anyway.

31:54.875 --> 31:56.874
- No one's seen him for days.
- Call someone else.

31:56.875 --> 32:00.208
- I am trying, okay?
- Yes, you're very fucking trying.

32:00.833 --> 32:04.165
It's pain medication. They're out of date,
but it's better than nothing.

32:04.166 --> 32:06.749
Yeah, no, uh, this is... this is perfect.

32:06.750 --> 32:07.749
- [Sam] Oh fuck.
- What?

32:07.750 --> 32:09.582
[man on TV] <i>How serious
are these allegations?</i>

32:09.583 --> 32:12.290
[woman on TV] <i>Well,
they're incredibly serious allegations.</i>

32:12.291 --> 32:15.165
<i>The Chinese government
essentially accusing the Americans</i>

32:15.166 --> 32:17.374
<i>of a covert operation against them.</i>

32:17.375 --> 32:22.124
<i>The implication is that China believe
that an American agent</i>

32:22.125 --> 32:25.707
<i>has played a part in the murder
of their ambassador to Great Britain.</i>

32:25.708 --> 32:30.415
<i>Now, what this means in terms
of international law is as yet unclear,</i>

32:30.416 --> 32:31.624
<i>but what we do know</i>

32:31.625 --> 32:35.499
<i>is that all eyes will be
both on Washington and on Downing Street</i>

32:35.500 --> 32:36.707
<i>to see the reactions...</i>

32:36.708 --> 32:38.665
Yeah. Yeah, that's... that's me.

32:38.666 --> 32:40.833
That's great. I'm on TV.

32:41.333 --> 32:42.790
I mean, you know what that is?

32:42.791 --> 32:45.999
That is the shit cherry
on a fucking shitty little icing

32:46.000 --> 32:47.749
on just a big fucking cake of shit.
