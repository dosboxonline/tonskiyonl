WEBVTT

00:04.296 --> 00:06.173
[Terry] And those of you

00:04.296 --> 00:06.173
patrolling 7th avenue,

00:06.214 --> 00:08.008
please be aware of the new

00:06.214 --> 00:08.008
pedal pubs.

00:08.049 --> 00:10.177
They're bike-powered

00:08.049 --> 00:10.177
mobile bars

00:10.218 --> 00:11.971
that are very popular

00:10.218 --> 00:11.971
with bachelorette parties.

00:12.011 --> 00:14.264
But unfortunately they have

00:12.011 --> 00:14.264
led to a dramatic increase

00:14.306 --> 00:17.351
in the rarely seen case

00:14.306 --> 00:17.351
of<i> female</i> public urination.

00:17.392 --> 00:19.102
-Resist.

00:17.392 --> 00:19.102
-[Holt] That's everything,

00:19.144 --> 00:21.062
but before we go home,

00:19.144 --> 00:21.062
but quick reminder that today

00:21.104 --> 00:24.107
is Sergeant Santiago's last day

00:21.104 --> 00:24.107
before maternity leave.

00:24.149 --> 00:26.360
-[applause]

00:24.149 --> 00:26.360
-We'll see you

00:24.149 --> 00:26.360
in three months.

00:26.401 --> 00:29.070
[Scully]

00:26.401 --> 00:29.070
She gets three months off?

00:26.401 --> 00:29.070
Can I take a maternity leave?

00:29.112 --> 00:31.072
Are you giving birth

00:29.112 --> 00:31.072
to a baby?

00:31.114 --> 00:33.367
I'm having a seven pound mass

00:31.114 --> 00:33.367
removed from my abdomen next

00:31.114 --> 00:33.367
week.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.285
-[all groan]

00:33.408 --> 00:35.285
-Yeah, never ask

00:33.408 --> 00:35.285
Scully questions.

00:35.327 --> 00:36.286
That's on me, guys!

00:36.328 --> 00:37.579
Dismissed.

00:39.748 --> 00:42.543
[Charles] So, have you guys

00:39.748 --> 00:42.543
decided on a name yet?

00:42.584 --> 00:44.378
We're not telling people

00:42.584 --> 00:44.378
until he's born.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.254
Not the baby's name--my name.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.254
What's he gonna call me?

00:46.296 --> 00:48.966
Uncle Chuck? Unky C? Ooh--

00:46.296 --> 00:48.966
Chee-Chee, so he says it early?

00:49.008 --> 00:50.467
Maybe just Charles.

00:50.509 --> 00:51.802
Wait, so my dad gets to be

00:50.509 --> 00:51.802
his "Pop-Pop,"

00:51.844 --> 00:53.261
but I'm just "Charles?"

00:53.303 --> 00:54.930
Your dad does not get

00:53.303 --> 00:54.930
to be his "Pop-Pop."

00:54.972 --> 00:57.725
Well I hope you're prepared

00:54.972 --> 00:57.725
to make that phone call.

00:58.642 --> 01:00.101
[Jake]

00:58.642 --> 01:00.101
Uh, what was that?

01:00.143 --> 01:02.437
Wow, all of Brooklyn

01:00.143 --> 01:02.437
lost power.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.606
You know, I've always

01:02.479 --> 01:04.606
kind of liked blackouts.

01:04.648 --> 01:06.817
Listen to how quiet it is.

01:04.648 --> 01:06.817
It's so peaceful.

01:06.859 --> 01:09.152
-[gunshots, screaming]

01:06.859 --> 01:09.152
-[tires screeching]

01:09.194 --> 01:10.779
Nope, it immediately

01:09.194 --> 01:10.779
turned into a purge.

01:10.821 --> 01:12.531
Way to go, New York.

01:10.821 --> 01:12.531
All right, let's suit up!

01:12.573 --> 01:14.199
[theme music playing]

01:32.509 --> 01:33.969
Maybe it's not so bad

01:32.509 --> 01:33.969
out there.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.554
I mean, none of our

01:34.011 --> 01:35.554
phones are ringing.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.305
That's because all the

01:35.596 --> 01:37.305
cell towers are down.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.058
Nobody has landlines anymore,

01:37.347 --> 01:39.058
so they can't call in.

01:39.098 --> 01:40.434
Huh, really makes you think

01:39.098 --> 01:40.434
about society's reliance

01:40.475 --> 01:41.560
on modern technology,

01:40.475 --> 01:41.560
doesn't it?

01:41.602 --> 01:43.102
-No.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.102
-Yeah, me neither.

01:43.144 --> 01:44.479
I just thought maybe

01:43.144 --> 01:44.479
that's how you see it.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.398
Guys, stop wasting time.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.398
Headlamps on!

01:46.440 --> 01:48.316
We have to engage

01:46.440 --> 01:48.316
in blackout protocol.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.611
I'm surprised, those guys are

01:48.358 --> 01:50.611
really springing into action.

01:50.652 --> 01:51.946
Nope, they're just

01:50.652 --> 01:51.946
eating all the food

01:51.987 --> 01:53.781
in the fridge before

01:51.987 --> 01:53.781
it goes bad.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.323
There's a dozen sandwiches

01:53.822 --> 01:55.323
here, I don't know what kind.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.575
I'll figure it out later.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.575
Just start chewing.

01:56.617 --> 01:57.952
Yeah, they suck.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.828
So, only Captain Holt

01:57.993 --> 01:59.828
or Terry can initiate

01:59.870 --> 02:01.538
actual blackout protocol,

02:01.580 --> 02:03.373
-but I don't see them anywhere.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.373
-[Jake] Guys?

02:03.415 --> 02:05.125
Where did our dads go?

02:05.166 --> 02:07.544
Hello? Anyone?

02:07.586 --> 02:09.088
We're stuck in the elevator!

02:09.129 --> 02:10.672
Can't you yell any louder?

02:10.714 --> 02:12.466
Use those big strong lungs

02:10.714 --> 02:12.466
you're always flexing.

02:12.507 --> 02:13.759
These are my pecs.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.010
So this is all just

02:13.801 --> 02:15.010
for show then.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.303
It has no functional purpose.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.972
I mean, I am pretty strong.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.640
Good, then rip

02:18.013 --> 02:19.640
those doors open.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.183
-I can't do that.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.183
-Oh, well at least you haven't

02:22.225 --> 02:24.185
dedicated a significant

02:22.225 --> 02:24.185
portion of your life

02:24.227 --> 02:25.395
to looking like this.

02:25.437 --> 02:27.648
-What is with you?

02:25.437 --> 02:27.648
-I'm sorry.

02:27.689 --> 02:30.692
This is a nightmare of mine.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.694
I have a phobia of elevators.

02:32.736 --> 02:35.489
It stems from a traumatic

02:32.736 --> 02:35.489
experience I had as a child.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.866
They only perform

02:35.530 --> 02:37.866
rated-load testing

02:37.908 --> 02:41.328
on city elevators

02:37.908 --> 02:41.328
every five years?

02:42.203 --> 02:43.998
Oh, my.

02:44.039 --> 02:47.001
That was the last time I read

02:44.039 --> 02:47.001
the municipal code before bed.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.502
But...

02:48.543 --> 02:50.045
the damage was done.

02:50.087 --> 02:51.880
Wait, look at this, sir.

02:50.087 --> 02:51.880
I think we'll be fine.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.924
It was inspected

02:51.922 --> 02:53.924
four months ago.

02:53.966 --> 02:56.760
By Walter Beverly,

02:53.966 --> 02:56.760
the clown prince

02:56.802 --> 02:58.053
of the Department of Buildings.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.888
You've made it so much worse.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.888
Help!

02:59.930 --> 03:01.222
[muffled screaming]

02:59.930 --> 03:01.222
Help!

03:01.264 --> 03:03.058
Yeah, they're trapped

03:01.264 --> 03:03.058
in there.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.560
Oh no, that means we have to

03:03.100 --> 03:05.560
call the fire department. [gags]

03:06.061 --> 03:08.647
Or, hear me out, we leave

03:06.061 --> 03:08.647
them in there forever,

03:08.689 --> 03:09.857
and move on emotionally.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.775
No.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.775
Call the fire department.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.276
All right,

03:11.817 --> 03:13.276
as the highest ranking officer

03:13.318 --> 03:15.029
not trapped in a box,

03:13.318 --> 03:15.029
I'll take charge.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.530
Uh, shouldn't you

03:15.070 --> 03:16.530
be taking it easy?

03:16.571 --> 03:18.157
Your shift's over.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.157
You're on maternity leave.

03:18.197 --> 03:20.034
-As the baby's Chee-Chee--

03:18.197 --> 03:20.034
-Charles, I'm fine,

03:20.075 --> 03:22.703
and this is an emergency.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.703
Subways aren't running,

03:22.744 --> 03:24.621
and we're gonna have a lot

03:22.744 --> 03:24.621
of people on the street.

03:24.663 --> 03:26.540
So I'm gonna call

03:24.663 --> 03:26.540
Mounted Division to

03:24.663 --> 03:26.540
help with crowd control.

03:26.581 --> 03:28.249
[Charles] But that's

03:26.581 --> 03:28.249
Sergeant Peanut Butter's unit.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.627
No one wants to work with that

03:28.291 --> 03:30.627
condescending dick.

03:30.669 --> 03:31.962
Okay, first of all,

03:30.669 --> 03:31.962
he's a horse,

03:32.004 --> 03:33.630
so he can't be condescending.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.799
Ugh, oh-ho, he's got you

03:33.672 --> 03:35.799
people fooled.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.176
Secondly...

03:37.217 --> 03:39.427
-He's a lieutenant now.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.427
-What?! How?!

03:39.469 --> 03:40.846
Charles, get it together.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.846
I want you and Jake

03:40.888 --> 03:42.430
to go to the Gowanus

03:40.888 --> 03:42.430
power substation.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.974
That's where the

03:42.472 --> 03:43.974
transformer exploded.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.684
Work with ESU,

03:45.726 --> 03:47.186
get us a timetable for the power

03:45.726 --> 03:47.186
being restored, and hurry!

03:47.227 --> 03:48.937
Wow, look at my pregnant

03:47.227 --> 03:48.937
wife taking charge.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.856
I don't know whether

03:48.979 --> 03:50.856
to be proud or turned on.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.025
-I said hurry.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.025
-Oh, my God, it's both.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.111
Hey, what happened?

03:56.153 --> 03:57.612
Someone lost control

03:56.153 --> 03:57.612
of their car,

03:57.654 --> 03:58.947
jumped the curb,

03:57.654 --> 03:58.947
went through the fence,

03:58.989 --> 04:00.615
and rammed

03:58.989 --> 04:00.615
into the transformer.

04:00.657 --> 04:01.909
Guy must have been drunk.

04:00.657 --> 04:01.909
There was an empty bottle

04:01.950 --> 04:03.284
of vodka on the floor

04:01.950 --> 04:03.284
of the car.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.578
Okay, Charles,

04:03.326 --> 04:04.578
I see two possibilities.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.163
One, he was vaporized

04:04.619 --> 04:06.163
into a being

04:06.205 --> 04:07.497
of pure electricity,

04:06.205 --> 04:07.497
becoming a supervillian

04:07.539 --> 04:09.166
known only as

04:07.539 --> 04:09.166
"The Surge Freak."

04:09.208 --> 04:10.834
-Seems unlikely.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.834
-Yeah, I know, Officer Rick,

04:10.876 --> 04:12.711
that's why I said there

04:10.876 --> 04:12.711
were two possibilities.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.671
He probably just hobbled off

04:12.753 --> 04:14.671
so he wouldn't get a DUI.

04:14.713 --> 04:17.424
Here, we'll follow this very

04:14.713 --> 04:17.424
obvious trail of blood.

04:17.465 --> 04:19.176
Happy now?

04:19.218 --> 04:21.469
Stupid Officer Rick and his

04:19.218 --> 04:21.469
stupid joyless approach to life.

04:21.511 --> 04:22.679
Come on!

04:25.224 --> 04:26.725
-[Charles] I can't see anything.

04:25.224 --> 04:26.725
-[Jake] Me neither.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.019
We'll just have to rely

04:26.767 --> 04:29.019
on our other senses.

04:29.061 --> 04:30.311
[Charles] I call smell.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.939
Okay, really jumped

04:30.353 --> 04:31.939
on that one.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.398
I wasn't gonna fight you

04:31.980 --> 04:33.398
for smell.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.733
I figured we'd just

04:33.440 --> 04:34.733
listen for sounds.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.693
Pfft, good luck with that.

04:36.735 --> 04:39.279
[sniffs]

04:36.735 --> 04:39.279
Hmm.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.240
[sniffs]

04:39.320 --> 04:41.240
Yeah.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.868
[sniffs]

04:41.281 --> 04:44.868
Mm-hmm.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.286
-Okay.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.286
-How's it going over there?

04:46.327 --> 04:47.829
You hearing anything?

04:47.871 --> 04:49.706
Yeah, I'm hearing you

04:47.871 --> 04:49.706
and your creepy sniffs.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.583
Really? Well I'm smelling a

04:49.748 --> 04:51.583
lot of jealousy

04:51.625 --> 04:53.001
coming from your direction.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.253
-Sound to the left.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.253
-Smell to the left.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.171
[crashing]

04:56.213 --> 04:57.798
[Jake] NYPD, hands up!

04:57.839 --> 05:00.842
[sniffs]

04:57.839 --> 05:00.842
Oh, yeah, we got him.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.177
Charles.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.304
Aw, this ice cream

05:02.219 --> 05:04.304
is melting.

05:04.345 --> 05:05.889
Who cares?

05:04.345 --> 05:05.889
We can drink melted ice cream.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.141
We can't eat spoiled ham.

05:07.182 --> 05:08.850
We have to prioritize!

05:08.892 --> 05:10.310
What if we combine them?

05:10.351 --> 05:11.937
Wrap the ice cream

05:10.351 --> 05:11.937
in the ham like a taquito.

05:11.979 --> 05:15.565
This man.

05:11.979 --> 05:15.565
This man is my best friend.

05:15.607 --> 05:17.943
You two are the worst people

05:15.607 --> 05:17.943
to have around in an emergency.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.487
I literally can't

05:17.985 --> 05:20.487
imagine a scenario

05:17.985 --> 05:20.487
where you'd be helpful.

05:20.528 --> 05:22.614
Murder at a Cinnabon.

05:20.528 --> 05:22.614
Who would you call?

05:22.656 --> 05:24.574
Someone who wouldn't

05:22.656 --> 05:24.574
be distracted by the frosting.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.701
Yeah, I do love

05:24.616 --> 05:26.701
that frosting.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.162
Hey Diaz, heard you guys

05:26.743 --> 05:28.162
needed help

05:28.203 --> 05:30.038
-from some real heroes.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.038
-Please.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.582
Firefighters are basically

05:30.080 --> 05:32.582
just EMTs who all live together

05:32.624 --> 05:34.417
-and sleep in bunk beds.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.417
-Correction.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.962
It's a professional,

05:34.459 --> 05:36.962
multi-tiered, shared

05:34.459 --> 05:36.962
sleeping set-up.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.464
You're describing bunk beds.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.464
Just get the people

05:37.004 --> 05:39.464
out of the elevator.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.424
[Amy] We should have

05:39.506 --> 05:41.424
all ambulances on call.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.342
I want an open line

05:41.466 --> 05:43.342
of communication with DOT,

05:43.384 --> 05:44.970
and I want someone

05:43.384 --> 05:44.970
from the DA down here

05:45.012 --> 05:46.471
so we don't get

05:45.012 --> 05:46.471
cases thrown out.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.098
I need a pair of sweatpants,

05:46.513 --> 05:48.098
and check again

05:48.140 --> 05:49.891
on that status update from ESU.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.019
All right, go go go!

05:52.060 --> 05:53.478
What do you need

05:52.060 --> 05:53.478
the sweatpants for?

05:53.520 --> 05:55.272
My water just broke,

05:53.520 --> 05:55.272
which reminds me,

05:55.314 --> 05:56.648
we should be prepared

05:55.314 --> 05:56.648
to distribute

05:56.690 --> 05:57.691
emergency water and food.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.318
Your water just broke?!

06:02.112 --> 06:04.072
We need to go to

06:02.112 --> 06:04.072
a hospital right now.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.324
I don't want a birth

06:04.114 --> 06:05.324
happening around me.

06:05.364 --> 06:06.449
It's way too gross.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.742
I'm nowhere near

06:06.491 --> 06:07.742
giving birth.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.244
I haven't even lost

06:07.784 --> 06:09.244
my mucus plug.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.829
Amy, you need to get

06:09.286 --> 06:10.829
the [bleep] out of here.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.665
I'm sorry my baby

06:10.871 --> 06:13.665
grosses you out, Rosa.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.292
I'm excited to meet

06:13.707 --> 06:15.292
your baby when it's clean

06:15.334 --> 06:16.835
and wearing clothes,

06:15.334 --> 06:16.835
and not blasting out of you

06:16.877 --> 06:18.545
like some half-Cuban

06:16.877 --> 06:18.545
Jimmy Neutron.

06:18.586 --> 06:19.713
I'm just at the

06:18.586 --> 06:19.713
start of my labor.

06:19.754 --> 06:20.922
I haven't even had my first

06:20.964 --> 06:26.136
contrac...

06:20.964 --> 06:26.136
[moaning]

06:26.178 --> 06:27.888
-...tion.

06:26.178 --> 06:27.888
-Was that a contraction?

06:27.929 --> 06:29.223
No.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.099
That was just a crazy yawn.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.809
[sighs] Fine, look--

06:32.851 --> 06:34.686
I don't have to go to the

06:32.851 --> 06:34.686
hospital until my contractions

06:34.728 --> 06:37.105
are three minutes apart and

06:34.728 --> 06:37.105
last for at least 45 seconds.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.899
Yeah, but don't you need to

06:37.147 --> 06:38.899
go home and pack some stuff?

06:38.940 --> 06:40.650
[scoffs]

06:38.940 --> 06:40.650
I'll be fine.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.986
Scully, you have a hospital

06:40.692 --> 06:42.986
go-bag at your desk, right?

06:43.028 --> 06:45.072
Yep, what do you need?

06:43.028 --> 06:45.072
One-day, three-day, coma kit?

06:45.113 --> 06:46.698
I rest my case.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.658
[Rosa on radio]

06:46.740 --> 06:48.658
<i>Peralta, you there?</i>

06:48.700 --> 06:50.369
-Yeah, what's up?

06:48.700 --> 06:50.369
<i>-You gotta get back</i>

06:48.700 --> 06:50.369
<i>here right now.</i>

06:50.409 --> 06:51.536
-Amy's water broke.

06:50.409 --> 06:51.536
-What?

06:51.578 --> 06:53.454
-What? When?

06:51.578 --> 06:53.454
-When?

06:53.496 --> 06:55.082
-Did she lose her mucus plug?

06:55.123 --> 06:56.708
<i>I can't believe you're</i>

06:55.123 --> 06:56.708
<i>making me say this, but</i>

06:56.750 --> 06:58.459
she thinks she lost

06:56.750 --> 06:58.459
her mucus plug yesterday,

06:58.501 --> 07:00.128
but mistook it

06:58.501 --> 07:00.128
for normal discharge.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.713
How thick was it?

07:00.170 --> 07:01.713
Was it clear or milky?

07:01.755 --> 07:04.007
Was it bloody?

07:01.755 --> 07:04.007
Was it "the bloody show?"

07:04.049 --> 07:06.260
Jake, I think it's very cool

07:04.049 --> 07:06.260
that you've learned this,

07:04.049 --> 07:06.260
very progressive.

07:06.301 --> 07:07.635
Charles, I think you know

07:06.301 --> 07:07.635
you crossed a line.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.388
<i>Just get back here, now!</i>

07:09.428 --> 07:10.430
-Copy.

07:09.428 --> 07:10.430
-This is it.

07:10.471 --> 07:11.639
My purpose is clear.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.267
I was put on this Earth

07:13.308 --> 07:15.685
to get you back in time

07:13.308 --> 07:15.685
to see your baby's birth.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.813
I mean, you're a grown man

07:15.727 --> 07:18.813
with your own hopes and dreams.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.942
My purpose is clear.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.735
-Okay.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.735
-Excuse me,

07:23.777 --> 07:26.280
my apartment is

07:23.777 --> 07:26.280
on the seventh floor,

07:26.321 --> 07:28.240
and the elevator

07:26.321 --> 07:28.240
isn't working.

07:28.282 --> 07:29.908
I'm getting cold.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.618
Well, we're headed back

07:29.950 --> 07:31.618
to our precinct.

07:31.659 --> 07:32.869
There's emergency power

07:31.659 --> 07:32.869
if you want to wait there

07:32.911 --> 07:34.829
for the lights

07:32.911 --> 07:34.829
to come back on.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.290
I'll get in back.

07:36.331 --> 07:39.126
I'm Dorothy, but my friends

07:36.331 --> 07:39.126
call me Dotty.

07:39.167 --> 07:42.963
Although these days there

07:39.167 --> 07:42.963
are fewer and fewer of them.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.465
Charles?

07:43.004 --> 07:45.465
Uh, this is great, Dotty,

07:43.004 --> 07:45.465
but we're kind of in a hurry.

07:45.506 --> 07:46.758
My wife just went into labor

07:45.506 --> 07:46.758
and I want to get there

07:46.800 --> 07:48.635
-in time for the birth.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.635
-Why?

07:48.676 --> 07:52.306
-The only man in the room

07:48.676 --> 07:52.306
should be the doctor.

07:48.676 --> 07:52.306
-Okay.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.057
All the dad needs to do

07:52.347 --> 07:54.057
is to make the money

07:54.099 --> 07:55.683
and have a nice, thick belt

07:55.725 --> 07:57.769
for when it's time

07:55.725 --> 07:57.769
to teach him a lesson.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.562
My dad hit me with a belt.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.481
Soon as I got big enough,

07:59.604 --> 08:01.481
I shot him.

08:01.522 --> 08:04.067
Wow, what a fun group

08:01.522 --> 08:04.067
for this,

08:04.109 --> 08:06.194
the most important day

08:04.109 --> 08:06.194
of my life.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.114
[cars honking]

08:09.156 --> 08:11.574
Don't worry,

08:09.156 --> 08:11.574
fire department's on the job.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.076
[Holt] Hear that, Jeffords?

08:13.118 --> 08:15.495
We're gonna die in here.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.495
We're marked for death!

08:15.536 --> 08:17.456
Okay, calm down,

08:15.536 --> 08:17.456
I have an idea.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.707
When my parents would fight

08:17.497 --> 08:19.707
and my dad got scary,

08:19.749 --> 08:21.709
I would take my little

08:19.749 --> 08:21.709
brother upstairs

08:21.751 --> 08:23.044
and to distract him,

08:23.086 --> 08:24.921
I'd teach him dance moves.

08:26.465 --> 08:27.674
What kind of dance moves?

08:27.715 --> 08:29.050
Mostly '80s hip-hop.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.302
He loved Salt-N-Pepa.

08:30.344 --> 08:31.719
No, I won't be doing that.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.638
[elevator rumbles]

08:34.931 --> 08:37.434
Salt and Pepper,

08:34.931 --> 08:37.434
you say?

08:37.476 --> 08:41.604
Ugh, we haven't moved.

08:37.476 --> 08:41.604
Why is there so much

08:37.476 --> 08:41.604
traffic? Stupid Uber,

08:41.646 --> 08:43.690
New York used to be a

08:41.646 --> 08:43.690
paradise of open road.

08:43.731 --> 08:46.651
-Try the siren again.

08:43.731 --> 08:46.651
-[siren blares]

08:46.693 --> 08:50.447
In my day,

08:46.693 --> 08:50.447
people respected police.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.240
They respect us;

08:50.489 --> 08:52.240
they just have nowhere to go.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.409
God knows they won't go back

08:52.282 --> 08:54.409
to their own country.

08:54.451 --> 08:55.952
Dotty, I really wish you

08:54.451 --> 08:55.952
weren't such a big part

08:55.994 --> 08:57.704
-of my son's birth story.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.704
-We should walk.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.914
It's only 27 blocks,

08:57.745 --> 08:59.914
it's gotta be faster than this.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.712
I mean, it's

09:04.044 --> 09:05.712
a little bit faster.

09:05.753 --> 09:07.755
Is it? Hey, Dotty, just

09:05.753 --> 09:07.755
weighing our options here.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.632
Have you ever been worn

09:07.797 --> 09:09.632
like a backpack?

09:09.674 --> 09:11.343
Okay, okay, you take the perp

09:09.674 --> 09:11.343
back to the precinct.

09:11.385 --> 09:13.387
-I'll stay here with her.

09:11.385 --> 09:13.387
-Are you sure?

09:13.428 --> 09:14.721
Just remember

09:13.428 --> 09:14.721
to tell your son

09:14.762 --> 09:16.390
what Chee-Chee

09:14.762 --> 09:16.390
did here tonight.

09:16.431 --> 09:17.807
How you feeling

09:16.431 --> 09:17.807
about Chee-Chee

09:17.849 --> 09:19.142
having said it out loud

09:17.849 --> 09:19.142
a few times?

09:19.184 --> 09:20.310
I am loving it!

09:20.352 --> 09:22.229
[woman]

09:20.352 --> 09:22.229
Help, I need help!

09:22.270 --> 09:23.730
Jake, we don't have time.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.730
We'll call it in.

09:23.771 --> 09:25.106
Let someone else handle it.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.441
No, we can't ignore

09:25.148 --> 09:26.441
a cry for help.

09:26.483 --> 09:27.901
We can handcuff him

09:26.483 --> 09:27.901
to the railing

09:27.942 --> 09:29.319
Dotty, call out

09:27.942 --> 09:29.319
if you need anything.

09:29.361 --> 09:30.695
I'd feel safer

09:29.361 --> 09:30.695
if you just shot him.

09:30.737 --> 09:31.738
[Jake] Dotty, no.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.948
We're not gonna shoot him!

09:33.990 --> 09:35.867
Hey, what's the update

09:33.990 --> 09:35.867
from OEM

09:35.909 --> 09:37.369
about the power

09:35.909 --> 09:37.369
coming back on?

09:37.411 --> 09:38.745
Yeah, they're working on it.

09:37.411 --> 09:38.745
So, listen,

09:38.786 --> 09:39.662
I've been timing

09:38.786 --> 09:39.662
your contractions.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.788
What? How?

09:40.830 --> 09:42.499
I've been hiding them so well.

09:42.541 --> 09:43.708
No, you have not.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.419
There's too much

09:43.750 --> 09:45.419
radio chatter.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.837
Let's try to keep non-emergency

09:45.460 --> 09:47.837
communications down to a--

09:47.879 --> 09:50.882
[groaning]

09:50.924 --> 09:52.384
minimum.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.135
They're happening

09:52.426 --> 09:54.135
every five minutes

09:54.177 --> 09:55.554
and they're lasting 20 seconds.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.554
Your baby's coming.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.264
It's still not active labor.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.015
Don't worry!

09:57.305 --> 09:59.015
I'm not gonna have the baby

When she gets back,

What? No you're not.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.428
You got drunk

12:02.055 --> 12:03.973
Yeah, that was a relapse.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.973

12:04.015 --> 12:06.725
Okay, so you're clearly

12:06.767 --> 12:08.269
you planted

12:06.767 --> 12:08.269
the bottle of vodka.

12:08.311 --> 12:09.770
Which means the crash

12:08.311 --> 12:09.770
wasn't an accident.

We can pedal down there,

12:32.877 --> 12:34.003
and then I'll meet her at First

Okay,

12:35.714 --> 12:38.883
so I didn't find my other shoe,

12:35.714 --> 12:38.883
but I did meet Luis.

13:04.158 --> 13:05.826

13:05.868 --> 13:08.037

20:41.532 --> 20:43.283
away for this.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.578
Captain, Lieutenant,

20:45.619 --> 20:47.246
the dance was great,

20:47.287 --> 20:49.665
and it really helped,

20:47.287 --> 20:49.665
thank you.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.125
Dance? What dance?

20:51.167 --> 20:52.418
She doesn't know

20:51.167 --> 20:52.418
what she's talking about.

20:52.459 --> 20:53.920
Mommy brain much?

20:53.961 --> 20:56.380
Captain Holt and I did

20:53.961 --> 20:56.380
a hip-hop dance routine.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.257
Oh.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.926
I see.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.926
Well, you know what?

20:59.967 --> 21:01.468
I don't even care

20:59.967 --> 21:01.468
that I missed it,

21:01.510 --> 21:04.263
because right now,

21:01.510 --> 21:04.263
I am holding my son,

21:04.304 --> 21:06.640
and there's nothing more

21:04.304 --> 21:06.640
important in the world

21:04.304 --> 21:06.640
than that.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.267
I have a video,

21:06.682 --> 21:08.267
if you wanna see it.

21:08.308 --> 21:09.894
Amy, hold this baby.

21:08.308 --> 21:09.894
Rosa, give me that phone.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.478
Give me that phone.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.478
Everyone wash your hands.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.606
<i>-Not a doctor.</i>

21:11.520 --> 21:13.606
<i>-Shh.</i>

21:13.647 --> 21:15.816
<i>Fremulon.</i>
