WEBVTT

02:44.917 --> 02:46.282
Boo-boo.

02:52.692 --> 02:55.160
Couldn't we read another book?

02:57.330 --> 02:59.560
We've read this one a hundred times.

03:00.667 --> 03:02.828
Please?

03:03.069 --> 03:08.063
Nanny Gilbertine is so tired of
the Boo-boo book, she could just gag.

03:08.174 --> 03:10.233
Boo-boo.

03:12.078 --> 03:14.239
All right. All right.

03:17.118 --> 03:23.114
"One fine and sunny day,
Baby Boo's nanny Henrietta said.

03:23.224 --> 03:28.993
'Baby Boo, today you shall go
on a wonderful adventure."'

03:29.064 --> 03:32.328
"'You will see the many,
many sights of the Big City."'

03:37.471 --> 03:41.237
"After a lovely breakfast
they walked down the lane to the corner,

03:41.308 --> 03:44.176
where they boarded a big, blue bus."

03:45.448 --> 03:47.915
"They were on their way to the Big City."

03:48.049 --> 03:50.917
"Baby Boo felt very grown-up indeed,

03:51.019 --> 03:54.649
for this was his first trip
away from Mother and Father."

03:56.958 --> 03:58.619
Did I tell you?

03:58.693 --> 04:03.187
- Baby's having his picture taken today.
- Oh. Say hello to old Willy for me.

04:04.299 --> 04:08.827
Old Willy isn't doing it.
I've hired Downtown Baby Photographers.

04:10.438 --> 04:13.635
He's photographed Cotwell babies
since the Depression.

04:13.708 --> 04:17.041
Old Willy hasn't had a picture
in the paper in over 20 years.

04:17.113 --> 04:20.207
Everyone we know has had
their baby's picture in the paper.

04:20.284 --> 04:23.651
Baby Bink is almost a year old
and virtually unknown.

04:24.220 --> 04:29.659
I can't count the number of times I've been
asked why we're keeping our baby a secret.

04:31.460 --> 04:33.485
You're right.

04:33.596 --> 04:36.503
The only way to quiet
such talk is to have our

04:36.515 --> 04:39.125
small-minded friends
open up their papers

04:39.235 --> 04:43.001
and see a photograph of
the prettiest baby in the city.

04:47.077 --> 04:51.036
- Get out! Come on!
- Come on, let's go. I said move it!

04:51.114 --> 04:53.014
Move it!

04:58.690 --> 05:02.284
Off with the fuzzy pink and blue sweaters,
nice and slow.

05:02.392 --> 05:04.752
Ed, does it matter who
wears pink or blue?

05:04.765 --> 05:05.555
No!

05:06.164 --> 05:09.655
Cotwell... Cotwell...
Where is that little...

05:11.635 --> 05:13.901
Dinner with the Westfalls tonight.

05:14.005 --> 05:18.170
Don't forget to do your breathing exercises
Dr Phillips suggested.

05:18.244 --> 05:22.203
- I have a breathing scheduled at 11.
- Bless your soul.

05:23.182 --> 05:25.046
Have a wonderful day.

05:29.188 --> 05:31.452
Bing?

05:31.589 --> 05:33.649
What did you forget?

05:35.126 --> 05:38.061
Oh, my pen! Thank you, Andrews.

05:38.897 --> 05:40.989
What else?

05:42.033 --> 05:44.833
Darling, you know how
I hate games in the morning.

05:47.873 --> 05:50.603
Of course. Goodness, how could I forget?

05:50.910 --> 05:53.139
Don't you get...

05:53.245 --> 05:57.410
Don't you get into any mischief
while Dada's gone. Burble, burble.

05:57.484 --> 06:01.682
Won't it be exciting when he can understand
the wonderful things we say to him?

06:01.821 --> 06:04.483
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

06:34.988 --> 06:38.014
He can't look too butch,
but he can't look too feminine.

06:38.091 --> 06:40.890
He has to look angelic,
like a little prince.

06:40.994 --> 06:43.897
That would suggest blue.

06:43.998 --> 06:48.333
Blue? Won't that look like we're trying to
match his eyes? Won't it be too obvious?

06:48.437 --> 06:51.702
I see lots of babies with
blue eyes and blue outfits.

06:51.807 --> 06:54.799
What kind of babies?
Rich babies? Pretty babies?

06:54.876 --> 06:58.107
- Regular babies? Important babies?
- Regular babies.

06:58.613 --> 07:01.207
Baby Bink is not a regular baby.

07:08.990 --> 07:10.958
Buff, buff, buff, buff, buff.

07:11.025 --> 07:13.461
Oh, but how shiny they're getting.

07:23.205 --> 07:25.265
Now, now. Hold still.

07:28.711 --> 07:32.043
Ready? Very, very handsome. Let me see.

08:02.179 --> 08:04.044
Hello.

08:06.216 --> 08:08.582
Get the gear.

08:09.286 --> 08:11.187
Get the gear.

08:11.255 --> 08:15.282
- He didn't say "Get the gear, Veeko."
- I'm the supervisor. You get it.

08:15.393 --> 08:18.556
You got the blue sweater.
You help me get the gear.

08:28.573 --> 08:32.600
A most pleasant and
charming good day to you, sir.

08:33.077 --> 08:36.409
I am Mr Charlie,

08:36.780 --> 08:42.812
photographer de babe,
entirely at your service.

08:46.892 --> 08:50.123
You <i>were</i> expecting us?

08:53.699 --> 08:56.259
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

08:56.335 --> 08:58.860
Whoa, look at this place!

09:01.407 --> 09:03.272
Eddie.

09:11.651 --> 09:17.248
We ain't here to nick no bric-a-brac.
We're here for the hit of a lifetime.

09:17.357 --> 09:20.292
You wanna be a shoplifter, go to JC Penney.

09:28.835 --> 09:30.895
You think we can get away with this?

09:31.004 --> 09:34.906
No. I'm here because I've got
a wild curiosity about the electric chair.

09:35.675 --> 09:37.506
Sorry.

10:01.202 --> 10:03.728
What a gorgeous baby.

10:03.838 --> 10:06.204
You must be so proud.

10:07.041 --> 10:09.010
I'm Mrs Cotwell.

10:09.078 --> 10:10.806
I am Mr Charlie.

10:12.114 --> 10:14.014
Shall we begin?

10:27.129 --> 10:32.032
Mr Francis, if you will go to the vehicle
and retrieve my light meter.

10:41.077 --> 10:43.705
I'm going to be rich.

10:43.980 --> 10:46.677
I want individual photos of Baby Bink.

10:46.750 --> 10:50.344
Baby Bink? What
an absolutely delightful name.

10:50.453 --> 10:53.321
- It's a pet name for Bennington.
- Certainly.

10:53.390 --> 10:57.520
I want individual photos of Baby Bink,
and then a portrait of the two of us.

10:57.594 --> 11:00.325
Whatever you wish, however you wish.

11:00.397 --> 11:03.388
You photographed
the children of many of my friends.

11:03.533 --> 11:07.732
Those pictures are forever appearing
in newspapers and magazines.

11:07.839 --> 11:09.898
It is true.

11:11.242 --> 11:14.836
- His picture's never been published.
- That cannot be.

11:14.912 --> 11:16.608
It's true.

11:16.681 --> 11:23.348
I am sure in the not-so-distant future
this little fellow will be very well known.

11:25.156 --> 11:27.749
I want your very best. I want art.

11:27.859 --> 11:31.454
I want you to set a new standard
for beauty in baby photography.

11:31.896 --> 11:34.489
I so welcome the challenge, madame.

11:34.565 --> 11:39.299
And, to that end, may I
ask one small favor?

11:39.371 --> 11:42.899
May I have some time alone with the child?

11:47.880 --> 11:50.644
Oh, I need his complete attention.

11:50.716 --> 11:56.746
The great bond between you and your son,
his love for you, will distract him.

11:56.855 --> 12:00.688
I need to study his
marvelous little features,

12:00.701 --> 12:03.728
to learn how best
to photograph him.

12:03.829 --> 12:09.735
He does well with persons
he is not intimate with?

12:13.540 --> 12:15.632
Does he?

12:16.476 --> 12:18.910
He's a friendly boy, but he may not like...

12:19.012 --> 12:20.809
Excellent!

12:21.247 --> 12:23.910
Madame, if I might make a suggestion.

12:24.517 --> 12:31.081
Your garment Du jour, while
extremely magnificent, is so colorful,

12:31.157 --> 12:34.093
I am afraid it will dominate the photograph

12:34.160 --> 12:37.722
and detract from your natural beauty.

12:39.667 --> 12:43.228
I knew this outfit was wrong.
I'll be back in 15 minutes.

12:43.938 --> 12:47.270
Take all the time you need.

12:51.646 --> 12:54.137
If he gets cranky,

12:54.247 --> 12:56.443
read him his book.

12:56.517 --> 12:58.576
How invaluable.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.312
Thank you.

13:18.440 --> 13:20.839
Mr Andrews, get the winter wardrobe.

13:20.909 --> 13:23.434
- But, madam...
- Hurry, Gilbertine.

13:36.626 --> 13:38.890
There you go.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.087
Take the book.

13:52.542 --> 13:55.636
Bink really deserves this moment
in the spotlight.

13:55.712 --> 13:59.341
It's too bad the baby pictures
don't go on the front page.

14:00.250 --> 14:01.615
- Ma'am?
- Yeah?

14:13.397 --> 14:15.456
We gotta make this fast.

14:35.252 --> 14:37.312
I'm sorry it took so long.

14:45.163 --> 14:47.256
Where's Bink?

15:37.451 --> 15:39.248
Eddie?

15:39.319 --> 15:43.653
You're a smart guy. How do you tell
the front from the back on these diapers?

15:43.724 --> 15:46.250
Are there pockets in the front?

15:48.929 --> 15:51.724
Very funny. The front
and back are the same.

15:51.736 --> 15:54.425
Then it probably don't
make no difference.

15:54.835 --> 15:57.494
Put him in them regular
baby clothes. That

15:57.507 --> 16:00.364
fruit suit's a dead
giveaway he's a rich kid.

16:01.843 --> 16:04.438
Come on. Good boy.

16:34.843 --> 16:36.708
Ed?

16:36.813 --> 16:40.111
How do I know this milk
won't burn the kid's throat?

16:40.215 --> 16:42.207
If that matters.

16:42.284 --> 16:44.946
Try it on some skin first.

16:53.363 --> 16:55.523
What's the matter with you?

16:56.366 --> 16:58.561
I better let it cool down.

17:02.273 --> 17:04.570
You like that?

17:04.642 --> 17:06.007
Eddie?

17:06.076 --> 17:08.169
Watch the baby.

17:14.050 --> 17:17.816
Very good. Now see if
it works the other way.

17:24.694 --> 17:26.663
It works.

17:34.005 --> 17:35.871
Put him in the bedroom.

17:35.941 --> 17:40.274
The more he sleeps, the less attention
he draws from the neighbors.

17:40.344 --> 17:43.143
- And keep an eye on him.
- Here you go, kid.

17:43.248 --> 17:46.478
That little doo-doo machine
is my retirement money.

17:47.651 --> 17:49.551
All right.

17:49.653 --> 17:51.815
Nappy-nap time, little jerk.

17:55.961 --> 17:58.156
Go to sleep real nice

17:58.262 --> 18:01.165
cos Mr Teddy Bear over here,

18:01.234 --> 18:05.295
he's been up all night drinking with
the Barbie dolls and he needs his rest.

18:05.670 --> 18:08.230
All right. Drink your milk.

18:08.306 --> 18:10.070
Take your nap.

18:11.244 --> 18:13.575
Drink your milk! Take your nap!

18:16.716 --> 18:18.809
- Eddie!
- What?

18:18.885 --> 18:23.083
You got any suggestions how you
get these things to eat and sleep?

18:23.655 --> 18:25.715
Sing him a song.

19:30.392 --> 19:33.486
Eddie! What else did Mary's little lamb do?

19:33.596 --> 19:36.655
Didn't he put Humpty Dumpty
back together again?

19:37.999 --> 19:40.400
That was Nat King Cole.

19:40.469 --> 19:46.066
Nat King Cole stuck his finger in the pie
and yanked out the bird.

19:46.208 --> 19:51.202
How can a lamb put a Humpty
together again? He ain't got fingers.

19:54.717 --> 19:58.916
Norby! Knock off the singin'
and read him his storybook.

20:00.757 --> 20:02.520
If you can.

20:08.031 --> 20:10.090
Wanna hear a story?

20:13.103 --> 20:15.765
Let's see here. What do we got here?

20:24.381 --> 20:26.178
"Nanny...

20:26.316 --> 20:28.308
and Baby Boo...

20:30.454 --> 20:32.513
strolled...

20:32.591 --> 20:34.683
through...

20:34.759 --> 20:37.319
the great big...

20:39.897 --> 20:41.865
de...

20:43.668 --> 20:45.727
de...

20:46.971 --> 20:50.169
- department. Department store."

20:50.274 --> 20:54.108
"How many, many things there were to buy."

20:54.745 --> 20:56.873
Or steal, if I was writin' that book.

20:57.783 --> 21:00.843
Or steal, if I was writin' this book.

21:35.688 --> 21:39.557
Mrs Cotwell? Dale Grissom, FBI.

21:39.659 --> 21:41.718
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

21:41.794 --> 21:44.092
You'll have to ask me later.

21:44.163 --> 21:48.793
- I'm going to look for my baby.
- I'd rather you didn't. I need you here.

21:50.169 --> 21:52.660
- Don't coddle me, Mr Grissom.
- Mrs Cotwell,

21:52.740 --> 21:57.541
there are five million people in this city
and many places where your boy could be.

21:57.611 --> 22:02.344
It would be pointless and dangerous
for you to go out searching for your baby.

22:02.449 --> 22:07.046
I've been through a number of these cases.
I understand how you feel.

22:08.922 --> 22:11.413
Have you ever lost a child?

22:12.293 --> 22:13.761
No, ma'am.

22:14.129 --> 22:16.689
Then you can't possibly know how I feel.

22:18.899 --> 22:22.835
I apologize. But would
you stay here, please?

22:23.337 --> 22:25.670
For your baby's sake.

24:08.046 --> 24:10.104
Do you gotta do that?

24:13.084 --> 24:15.144
I like to look nice.

24:15.820 --> 24:17.880
You gotta spit?

24:19.658 --> 24:23.856
I don't know about you,
but I don't eat pieces of my body.

24:56.797 --> 24:58.697
What?

24:59.533 --> 25:02.024
- What did I do?
- You spit on me.

25:02.102 --> 25:04.263
- I did not!
- Somebody did,

25:04.338 --> 25:06.636
and you're the only one in the room.

25:22.757 --> 25:24.815
You jerk!

25:24.893 --> 25:28.021
What? No, no. Quiet.

25:28.129 --> 25:31.098
- You're gonna wake up the baby.
- The baby's on the roof!

25:44.279 --> 25:47.180
Hurry. Come on, hurry.

26:08.804 --> 26:10.669
Eddie!

26:13.709 --> 26:16.200
Ed. Hey, Ed, what happened?

26:17.346 --> 26:19.041
Eddie, are you OK?

26:22.853 --> 26:26.619
- People shouldn't leave this lying around.
- What are you doing, dope?

26:26.723 --> 26:28.918
It was in the way.

26:29.726 --> 26:31.660
- What happened?
- Right, pick him up.

26:31.728 --> 26:33.821
Eddie. Ed, you're drooling.

26:33.897 --> 26:38.961
- Eddie, come on. Come on, Ed. Come on.
- Eddie, what happened? Eddie?

26:39.503 --> 26:41.562
What? This way?

26:43.774 --> 26:46.470
Oh, great. It's gotta
be at least 1,000 feet.

26:46.543 --> 26:49.536
- Ed, we're gonna have to jump.
- We're gonna jump?

26:49.647 --> 26:53.105
- Yes. On three. Ready?
- OK.

26:53.251 --> 26:54.309
One.

26:54.452 --> 26:56.044
Two.

26:56.187 --> 26:57.230
Three.

27:05.396 --> 27:07.796
Eddie!

27:30.489 --> 27:33.023
Ed, look...

27:33.025 --> 27:34.925
out!

28:00.187 --> 28:03.053
- What?
- Package.

28:03.490 --> 28:07.984
- Where do you want me to sign?
- Anywhere's fine.

28:15.102 --> 28:17.594
Have a nice... day.

28:17.672 --> 28:19.731
You old bat.

28:22.910 --> 28:25.879
- Which way?
- This way.

28:39.627 --> 28:41.822
Ed!

28:41.896 --> 28:44.695
Are you all right?

28:44.766 --> 28:48.224
How can he be all right?
The guy fell off a building.

28:48.336 --> 28:53.296
Probably got contusions, concussions,
contractions. What's the matter with you?

29:12.828 --> 29:16.788
- Just take it easy. How you feelin'?
- Eddie, how many fingers I got up?

29:16.867 --> 29:19.858
- Two.
- Not you! Hey, Eddie, say somethin'.

29:19.936 --> 29:23.201
- Here, put him here.
- Sit down on the bench. Sit down.

29:23.540 --> 29:25.507
You OK?

29:25.609 --> 29:27.235
Eddie.

29:27.310 --> 29:29.176
When we first seen you fall,

29:29.246 --> 29:34.148
our first thoughts were with you
and your family, should you not survive.

29:34.284 --> 29:36.683
- I prayed, Eddie.
- Shut up!

29:58.675 --> 30:02.167
All right, take it easy.
You wanna maybe get to the right of him.

30:08.653 --> 30:10.917
Wait, Eddie. We don't wanna get a ticket.

30:15.327 --> 30:17.814
Get to the right.
Eddie, get to the right.

30:17.827 --> 30:18.660
Shut up!

30:21.467 --> 30:23.900
Move in front of him.
I'll jump on the back.

30:23.969 --> 30:26.562
- You're makin' me nuts!
- OK. Don't get crazy.

30:30.776 --> 30:33.904
- Just drive. I'll tell you.
- See that lady over there?

30:33.979 --> 30:36.913
There he is! I see him! There he is!

30:37.715 --> 30:39.775
We got him.

30:41.420 --> 30:43.513
He's gone! We lost him!

30:51.765 --> 30:53.926
Look both ways!

30:55.702 --> 30:57.135
I think you hit a cat.

30:57.203 --> 31:01.538
Here's the bus. Eddie, you see it?
He's gettin' ahead of us, Eddie.

31:01.641 --> 31:03.938
There's the bus again.

31:08.747 --> 31:11.273
Driver, next stop, please.

31:26.334 --> 31:28.029
Wait, I don't see him.

31:34.742 --> 31:37.677
- There's the bus.
- I see the bus!

31:37.745 --> 31:39.803
I'll get him!

31:40.715 --> 31:43.148
Wait! Wait! Stop the bus.

31:44.418 --> 31:46.387
I forgot somethin'! Stop the bus!

31:46.488 --> 31:49.924
Wait, wait, wait! Hello! Stop the bus!

31:49.992 --> 31:54.395
Halt! Stop the bus! Wait! Stop the bus!

31:59.001 --> 32:03.335
Did a baby get off this bus?
A little guy, about two feet tall.

32:03.438 --> 32:06.896
- It's an emergency!
- I didn't have nobody today with a baby.

32:07.109 --> 32:09.339
He was by himself!

32:12.781 --> 32:15.307
- What?
- He must have got off.

32:16.119 --> 32:18.451
Oh, great. We're through.

32:22.292 --> 32:25.261
If you didn't park your
van on the sidewalk,

32:25.328 --> 32:28.354
people could get by a lot easier.

32:31.301 --> 32:35.398
If you'd limit yourself to a couple of pork
roasts a day, you wouldn't need to worry.

32:35.400 --> 32:38.439
You heard me.

32:45.382 --> 32:47.475
Some people.

32:50.688 --> 32:53.282
- Eddie, how could he get off?
- I seen him.

32:53.357 --> 32:56.087
- What?
- He's in the big broad's purse.

32:57.027 --> 33:02.431
Yeah, this is Carl in 157.
You know anything about a missing baby?

33:02.866 --> 33:06.267
I see her. How could you miss her?
She's as big as a building.

33:06.337 --> 33:09.704
- Eddie, let me do this.
- Will you stop it?

33:09.773 --> 33:14.074
- How do we do it?
- Nonchalant. We'll give her a sandwich.

33:14.145 --> 33:18.104
- She don't need a sandwich. Look at her.
- That's my whole point.

33:18.183 --> 33:20.515
Wait.

33:37.535 --> 33:38.969
Eddie.

33:39.070 --> 33:41.129
Get her, Veeko! You get her, Veeko!

33:43.009 --> 33:49.347
Get her, Veeko. You got her, Veek.
Hang in there, Veek. You got her! Come on!

33:49.582 --> 33:50.708
Who's next?

33:52.184 --> 33:56.746
How about you, Mr Comedy?
"We'll give her a sandwich," huh?

33:56.822 --> 33:59.689
"As big as a building," huh?

33:59.759 --> 34:03.354
Not so easy making jokes
with my fist in your mouth, is it?

34:03.462 --> 34:06.364
- I'm not afraid of you.
- Come on. She's crazy.

34:06.465 --> 34:09.264
Anybody else wanna take a shot?

34:14.241 --> 34:16.301
Chicken!

35:00.289 --> 35:04.055
How did you get out of
Mother Goose Corner?

35:18.707 --> 35:21.734
So, you got a nasty little surprise for me?

35:28.283 --> 35:30.514
You guys are worthless!

35:30.587 --> 35:32.918
Yeah, right, Eddie. Blame us.

35:33.455 --> 35:36.339
You know, I'm gettin'
sick of your insults.

35:36.352 --> 35:38.051
Then why don't you quit?

35:38.128 --> 35:42.896
- Oh, yeah? Let you two have all the money?
- What money? The kid is gone!

35:43.501 --> 35:45.969
There you go, my little escape artist.

35:50.206 --> 35:55.008
Now, if you were a baby
lost in the big city, where would you go?

36:18.470 --> 36:23.168
<i>Speculation, but a ransom figure
in the millions of dollars was mentioned.</i>

36:23.275 --> 36:26.018
<i>Security is tight around
the Cotwell mansion</i>

36:26.031 --> 36:28.542
<i>and at Cotwell Industry
Towers downtown.</i>

36:28.647 --> 36:31.241
<i>Ronnie Lee has more on the story. Ronnie?</i>

36:31.349 --> 36:34.341
There's no word from police,
but our sources tell us

36:34.452 --> 36:39.082
<i>that a nine-month-old baby boy was abducted
at approximately ten o'clock this morning.</i>

36:39.192 --> 36:42.354
<i>We have confirmed that
a photographer and two assistants</i>

36:42.461 --> 36:45.088
<i>from the Downtown
Baby Photographers studio</i>

36:45.163 --> 36:49.157
<i>were scheduled to photograph
the missing child today.</i>

36:49.267 --> 36:52.499
<i>A spokesman for the photography
studio declined to comment.</i>

37:19.032 --> 37:25.870
<i>Extremely tight. In fact, police
and FBI units have sealed off the area.</i>

37:26.105 --> 37:30.566
Earlier I attempted to reach millionaire
Bennington Cotwell at his office.

37:30.978 --> 37:36.506
Though reporters were turned away, a
reliable source informed us that Cotwell...

37:40.188 --> 37:43.555
A spokesman for the company said
that Mr Cotwell was unavailable.

37:48.730 --> 37:53.132
Hang on a second. Keep rolling. OK.

38:13.355 --> 38:15.687
Where'd he go?

38:36.246 --> 38:38.373
We're always, like, this close.

38:53.730 --> 38:56.460
- Hello.
- <i>Hello. Is this Mr Cotwell?</i>

38:56.566 --> 39:00.798
- Yes. Who is this?
- <i>My name's Depke. Joe. Joe Depke.</i>

39:00.905 --> 39:06.572
<i>Yeah. Listen, I might have some information
on the whereabouts of that child.</i>

39:16.555 --> 39:19.114
- I seen the baby.
- Where?

39:19.223 --> 39:21.317
Right across the street on the curb.

39:21.392 --> 39:23.418
Where'd he go?

39:26.130 --> 39:29.429
It's the craziest thing. I don't remember.

39:29.533 --> 39:32.434
Maybe we'll take a ride.
See if you remember then.

39:32.536 --> 39:35.995
- You want money? How much?
- Don't embarrass me. Don't insult me.

39:36.108 --> 39:39.509
- Your money's no good here. Put it away.
- Where's the baby?

39:39.579 --> 39:41.705
House across the street.

39:42.814 --> 39:44.907
Second floor.

39:46.451 --> 39:50.251
McCrays. No guarantee.
Listen, mister, I didn't know your kid.

39:50.355 --> 39:52.448
I just saw his picture on TV.

39:53.625 --> 39:56.116
I called because I care.

40:04.670 --> 40:07.935
- Your name's McCray?
- Yeah. What did I do?

40:08.007 --> 40:10.840
We're looking for a missing child.

40:10.943 --> 40:14.276
- These are my kids.
- Mind if we take a look?

40:18.751 --> 40:20.844
Hello, ma'am.

40:26.492 --> 40:28.858
Hi.

40:30.798 --> 40:32.856
Sir, in here.

40:44.378 --> 40:46.006
Baby.

41:12.575 --> 41:14.633
You have a beautiful little boy.

41:17.612 --> 41:19.672
Thank you, ma'am.

41:21.049 --> 41:23.143
I'll pray he comes back to you.

41:24.886 --> 41:29.688
These kids are all I've got, so I know
how I'd feel if I was in your place.

41:30.792 --> 41:32.852
I hope you never are.

41:34.865 --> 41:37.163
For your children's sake.

41:46.877 --> 41:48.970
Sorry we inconvenienced you.

41:50.179 --> 41:52.239
Be there in a second.

41:55.585 --> 41:58.678
- I'm sorry for the trouble.
- Sir?

41:59.822 --> 42:05.784
I believe in my heart that someone
somewhere watches over the babies.

42:08.799 --> 42:11.028
Yes, I hope so.

42:16.340 --> 42:18.808
You have everything? Are you sure?

42:40.365 --> 42:43.995
I can't believe this. You know, it ain't
the wisest strategy to kidnap a baby

42:44.070 --> 42:47.903
and then let the damn thing
loose on the streets.

42:48.006 --> 42:52.409
Babies crawling in traffic tend
to draw attention, don't you think?

43:02.054 --> 43:05.650
To the left, I think. You see? The cab.

43:16.636 --> 43:18.729
Got you now, you little...

43:26.212 --> 43:29.203
- Eddie!
- My money!

43:41.395 --> 43:44.296
Come on! Come on! Go! Go!

43:48.302 --> 43:50.293
Go! No, wait!

43:52.239 --> 43:54.104
Stay! Stay there!

43:54.208 --> 43:56.267
Stay there!

43:57.211 --> 43:58.678
Don't go!

43:59.781 --> 44:02.045
Go! Now! Watch your feet.

44:05.453 --> 44:06.920
Stay there!

44:06.988 --> 44:10.515
OK, hang on. One, two, three - go.

44:26.975 --> 44:32.278
I worked at Burger King three years.
This is worse than that.

44:32.381 --> 44:36.545
Don't blame me. We'd be restin' easy
if Butterfingers here hadn't lost the kid.

44:36.619 --> 44:40.453
I lost the kid? I lost the kid?
Oh, well, that's news to me.

44:40.556 --> 44:44.219
- Who fell asleep reading nursery stories?
- Who left the window open?

44:46.962 --> 44:50.420
- That was me.
- You idiots are why we don't got the kid.

44:50.499 --> 44:53.456
As far as I'm concerned,
you can drop out and

44:53.469 --> 44:56.438
I'll keep the $5m. You
don't deserve a penny.

44:56.505 --> 44:59.202
- You'd stiff us?
- Wait a minute!

44:59.276 --> 45:04.179
Don't get hot, Eddie. Don't get hot. We're
all just tired from gettin' torn apart.

45:04.715 --> 45:09.152
Like I like to fall off buildings
and jump in ditches! That's the breaks.

45:09.219 --> 45:11.187
We're dealing with a baby.

45:11.255 --> 45:14.918
Babies are obviously
more dangerous than we thought.

45:14.992 --> 45:17.755
It don't figure, Eddie. They're so small.

45:17.828 --> 45:21.320
When I boxed, the guys I most feared
were those who feared nothin'.

45:21.398 --> 45:24.765
Babies are like that -
they ain't afraid of nothin'.

45:28.673 --> 45:30.436
Baby tracks.

45:50.662 --> 45:52.993
Norby, hey.

46:54.494 --> 46:57.363
The kid's in the gorilla cage.

46:59.767 --> 47:02.235
There goes our five million bucks, huh?

47:04.439 --> 47:06.599
I think the ape likes the kid.

47:17.585 --> 47:21.351
- What?
- You got long arms.

47:23.858 --> 47:25.851
Thanks.

47:32.968 --> 47:34.937
I can't reach him, Eddie.

47:37.273 --> 47:39.867
That's it. You got it.

47:45.247 --> 47:47.341
Easy does it.

47:47.983 --> 47:51.475
That's it. Slow, slow, slow. There.

47:51.587 --> 47:53.248
Easy.

48:14.344 --> 48:16.835
Nice monkey.

48:17.914 --> 48:19.472
Yes.

48:20.751 --> 48:24.050
He's startin' to cry, Eddie.
He'll make the monkey mad.

48:26.891 --> 48:28.381
Eddie, he's gettin' up.

48:29.026 --> 48:33.122
- I'm afraid, Eddie.
- Freeze. Just stare him down.

48:38.669 --> 48:40.762
That's it.

49:10.169 --> 49:11.430
Shut up!

50:05.059 --> 50:07.653
Hey, King Kong. Hey, over here.

50:08.429 --> 50:10.624
I'm a banana.

50:10.765 --> 50:14.826
I'm a coconut. I'm an entire fruit salad.

50:15.169 --> 50:17.899
Over here. Hey, look. I'm the Jungle Boy.

50:18.005 --> 50:21.566
Over here. That's it.

50:22.176 --> 50:24.236
Now you got it.

50:26.715 --> 50:28.410
I got him.

50:33.021 --> 50:34.852
I got him.

50:38.460 --> 50:41.225
Bad monkey.

52:32.178 --> 52:34.238
- Eddie?
- Careful, Eddie.

54:01.170 --> 54:03.262
Eddie.

54:04.941 --> 54:07.465
I know you don't wanna hear this, but...

54:10.612 --> 54:12.672
the kid's gone again.

55:13.011 --> 55:16.880
This morning all I wanted
was my baby's picture in the paper.

55:24.222 --> 55:26.350
I got my wish.

55:29.795 --> 55:31.854
Where's your mommy?

56:07.234 --> 56:10.431
Hey, Eddie, maybe
he went down a rabbit hole.

56:10.537 --> 56:14.735
We're serious about our work.
You wanna make jokes, join the circus.

56:17.578 --> 56:19.443
Bozo.

56:27.822 --> 56:30.950
Step on it, Eddie. Baby, starboard side.

56:32.026 --> 56:33.460
- Starboard.
- What?

56:33.561 --> 56:35.654
- Port.
- What is that?

56:35.763 --> 56:37.196
- Point!
- Nine o'clock!

56:37.265 --> 56:40.166
- Where is he?
- Over here at 6:30.

56:42.203 --> 56:43.465
Step on it.

56:45.340 --> 56:47.866
You're ours now, moneybags.

56:58.287 --> 57:01.552
Did Baby Bink miss his Uncle Eddie?

57:04.761 --> 57:06.853
- Come here.
- Get him.

57:09.832 --> 57:12.323
- Did you get him?
- No! Come on!

57:23.446 --> 57:25.573
Where'd he go?

57:25.648 --> 57:28.776
He went down a rabbit hole.

57:30.653 --> 57:33.552
Don't let those rabbits
chew your face off.

57:33.564 --> 57:35.590
Shut up, Veeko. Just shut up!

57:37.293 --> 57:42.663
No problem, fellas. It ain't a hole,
it's a tunnel. And what's every tunnel got?

57:42.732 --> 57:45.532
Don't tell me. I know, I know. It's a...

57:46.370 --> 57:48.565
Toll booth at the end.

57:48.639 --> 57:52.507
Are you always this stupid,
or do you do this just to annoy me?

57:52.611 --> 57:57.604
A tunnel has two ends.
This one's here, and the other one's...

57:57.716 --> 58:00.115
Where? Come on.

58:14.032 --> 58:17.366
- Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.
- Get him, Norby. Get him.

58:17.435 --> 58:20.667
- Don't let him get away.
- Here he is, Eddie.

58:22.841 --> 58:26.038
Today ain't your lucky
day, eh, shorty-pants?

58:27.979 --> 58:30.413
That wasn't so hard.

59:08.021 --> 59:11.547
- Beautiful day, huh?
- You know anything about that vehicle?

59:17.164 --> 59:19.793
Yes. It belongs to us.

59:19.867 --> 59:21.767
You left the engine running.

59:22.070 --> 59:23.661
Yes.

59:23.771 --> 59:25.796
I did.

59:25.873 --> 59:29.604
I've been having battery trouble.

59:30.644 --> 59:34.239
We just stopped by to admire the beauti...

59:36.450 --> 59:39.887
beautiful flowers.

59:47.762 --> 59:50.755
Have you guys seen a baby around here?

59:50.966 --> 59:53.025
The park is full of...

59:54.803 --> 59:58.295
- babies.
- Yeah, well, there's been a kidnapping.

59:58.406 --> 01:00:00.897
Well, that's a cryin' shame.

01:00:01.243 --> 01:00:03.972
It's amazing what people will do for money.

01:00:04.045 --> 01:00:06.105
Yeah, for five million...

01:00:07.282 --> 01:00:09.442
If we see anything...

01:00:13.456 --> 01:00:15.219
Excuse me.

01:00:16.026 --> 01:00:20.190
If we see anything, we'll
be sure to notify...

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.687
He's got a bad heart.

01:01:00.971 --> 01:01:03.029
Excuse me.

01:01:05.609 --> 01:01:07.667
The police.

01:01:08.479 --> 01:01:10.471
Thank you.

01:01:14.319 --> 01:01:19.312
Walk 'em to the car. My entire reproductive
system is about to go up in flames.

01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:27.798
Is that a Fleetline van?

01:01:30.235 --> 01:01:32.294
Eddie, is it?

01:01:33.338 --> 01:01:35.898
- Yes!
- Yes, it is.

01:01:36.007 --> 01:01:38.134
I thought so.

01:01:38.243 --> 01:01:41.145
My brother drives one
for a dry-cleaning firm.

01:01:41.247 --> 01:01:43.874
Oh, yeah, they drive a lot of those.

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:46.441
He's always had a lot of trouble with his.

01:01:46.519 --> 01:01:49.369
Give me a second, I'll
think of what he said

01:01:49.381 --> 01:01:52.116
is the problem with the
electrical system.

01:01:52.225 --> 01:01:54.284
- Alternator?
- No.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:56.760
- Carburetor?
- No.

01:01:58.264 --> 01:02:01.392
- There's this little relay thing.
- Veeko!

01:02:01.467 --> 01:02:03.594
Veeko.

01:02:03.669 --> 01:02:07.070
I think you should move the van.

01:02:07.173 --> 01:02:09.438
I have a frog in my throat.

01:02:11.178 --> 01:02:14.773
And a brush fire in my undershorts.
Get 'em outta here.

01:02:14.848 --> 01:02:19.444
It's just a bad battery. I think we should
move it before the engine dies.

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:24.480
Yeah, it's just the battery.
Let's get it outta here. Come on, let's...

01:02:34.301 --> 01:02:36.531
You sure can tell summer's here.

01:02:36.637 --> 01:02:39.106
People got those barbecues goin'.

01:02:43.044 --> 01:02:47.208
- Smells great, doesn't it?
- Come on, let's go move the van.

01:02:54.723 --> 01:02:56.622
I'll be right with you.

01:02:59.627 --> 01:03:02.460
I just have a cramp in my leg.

01:03:16.946 --> 01:03:18.811
Take it easy.

01:04:00.324 --> 01:04:02.690
That's how you put out campfires.

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:06.090
Is that a fact?

01:04:06.196 --> 01:04:08.257
Used to do it in Boy Scouts.

01:04:10.101 --> 01:04:13.036
You toasted your marshmallows

01:04:13.104 --> 01:04:17.006
over a pile of flaming gonads?

01:04:18.243 --> 01:04:20.472
We usually used logs.

01:04:22.013 --> 01:04:24.005
Follow that kid!

01:04:24.082 --> 01:04:26.845
We'll meet you on the other side.

01:04:26.918 --> 01:04:29.820
I'm sorry, man, but it was an emergency.

01:04:29.888 --> 01:04:33.016
- You were blazin' pretty hard...
- Shut up!

01:04:42.001 --> 01:04:44.093
Oh, boy, Eddie.

01:04:44.202 --> 01:04:47.104
You got burnt clear through your skivvies.

01:04:49.542 --> 01:04:52.271
Baby Bink! It's your mother!

01:04:52.344 --> 01:04:53.937
Baby Bink!

01:04:54.046 --> 01:04:57.016
I'll kill him.

01:05:36.858 --> 01:05:39.087
I'm sorry, ma'am.

01:05:45.033 --> 01:05:47.524
I haven't forgotten your feelings.

01:05:49.903 --> 01:05:51.997
My feelings don't matter.

01:06:03.685 --> 01:06:05.778
Yes, they do.

01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:08.614
They do very much.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:14.259
The love my baby's gotten
has been as much yours as mine.

01:06:18.033 --> 01:06:20.093
Probably more.

01:06:27.042 --> 01:06:29.102
Where's my little boy?

01:06:32.281 --> 01:06:34.614
What's he doing?

01:06:38.922 --> 01:06:42.915
If he were home,
he'd be going down for his nap.

01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:47.645
I got bad news.

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:49.844
The kid's...

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:52.912
in there.

01:09:53.421 --> 01:09:55.481
No, wait. Eddie, there's a guard.

01:09:55.625 --> 01:09:58.526
Eddie, no. Eddie, wait. No.

01:09:58.628 --> 01:10:01.894
- There's a guard.
- He's asleep, you moron.

01:10:04.101 --> 01:10:08.834
Where is he? Come on,
knucklehead. Where is he, huh?

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:17.638
Of course.

01:10:17.914 --> 01:10:20.041
Where else would he be?

01:10:25.022 --> 01:10:27.082
Let's go get him.

01:10:57.890 --> 01:11:00.154
Eddie.

01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:02.250
Baby, 12 o'clock.

01:11:06.198 --> 01:11:07.790
Up there.

01:11:13.939 --> 01:11:16.636
We'll be with you in just a minute.

01:11:22.749 --> 01:11:26.912
Lingerie, home furnishings,
men's hats, babies.

01:11:29.222 --> 01:11:33.818
- Wait a minute. We passed him.
- Yes, moron. We'll grab him as he goes by.

01:11:33.893 --> 01:11:37.693
Yeah, that's a good plan, Ed.
We grab him as he comes by.

01:11:37.765 --> 01:11:39.858
<i>You</i> grab him.

01:11:40.634 --> 01:11:42.693
- <i>I</i> grab him?
- Right.

01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:47.238
As the girder comes up,
you jump out on it and grab the baby.

01:11:47.308 --> 01:11:48.336
Me? By myself?

01:11:48.349 --> 01:11:51.471
You just step out on it.
It ain't difficult.

01:11:51.978 --> 01:11:54.709
- Why me?
- Norby's scared of heights.

01:11:54.849 --> 01:11:57.409
- Why don't <i>you</i> grab him?
- Nobody asked me!

01:12:07.094 --> 01:12:10.064
OK, OK. That's it.

01:12:10.132 --> 01:12:12.396
- Come on, don't miss him.
- I'll get it.

01:12:12.466 --> 01:12:14.526
Don't miss it. He's coming.

01:12:16.204 --> 01:12:21.267
- All right. Don't grab, OK?
- I'm not touching you. There it is. Go!

01:12:33.055 --> 01:12:35.045
Here he comes.

01:12:39.127 --> 01:12:41.493
How'd he do that?

01:12:42.899 --> 01:12:44.957
Baby luck.

01:12:58.382 --> 01:13:00.816
Eddie! Help me!

01:13:02.486 --> 01:13:05.853
- He asked for you, Ed.
- He ain't thinkin' straight.

01:13:05.923 --> 01:13:08.221
- Don't look down.
- What are you doin'?

01:13:08.292 --> 01:13:12.729
- Eddie, no! I'm gonna faint!
- Didn't I tell you not to look down?

01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:15.196
- Pull me back, please!
- I'm losing my grip.

01:13:15.265 --> 01:13:18.098
- Pull me back, please.
- Grab him by the leg.

01:13:18.202 --> 01:13:20.466
Grab him by the leg or I'll let you go!

01:13:20.537 --> 01:13:23.233
Don't look down.

01:13:23.307 --> 01:13:25.298
OK, good. You got him.

01:13:30.348 --> 01:13:31.781
Up!

01:13:34.885 --> 01:13:37.650
You're going the wrong way! Come up!

01:13:37.722 --> 01:13:40.555
- Rest on my feet.
- I could use a hand here!

01:13:40.658 --> 01:13:43.649
Hey, quit being a crybaby. Get up.

01:13:49.167 --> 01:13:52.068
You're doin' good, but
you gotta get back up.

01:13:52.136 --> 01:13:54.536
- I'm losin' him, Eddie.
- Quit foolin' around.

01:13:54.639 --> 01:13:56.301
Gimme a hand.

01:14:00.045 --> 01:14:01.478
What's the matter with you?

01:14:15.794 --> 01:14:17.284
Ed?

01:14:19.498 --> 01:14:21.989
- Eddie?
- Get off of me.

01:14:31.545 --> 01:14:34.036
There he is.

01:14:34.115 --> 01:14:36.639
Come on, we'll take the stairs.

01:15:32.442 --> 01:15:34.637
It's comin' back down. Get ready.

01:15:38.113 --> 01:15:41.048
- Now, jump.
- I'll wait for another.

01:15:41.116 --> 01:15:43.278
No, don't wait. Jump.

01:15:43.418 --> 01:15:45.478
Jump!

01:16:12.116 --> 01:16:13.980
My...

01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:15.915
spine.

01:17:26.292 --> 01:17:29.023
- I lived.
- Get back up here!

01:17:37.437 --> 01:17:40.064
Come here, you little ball of grief!

01:17:42.942 --> 01:17:46.901
Now I gotcha! You ain't
gonna crawl away from <i>this</i> one.

01:18:16.710 --> 01:18:18.268
That hurt!

01:18:52.515 --> 01:18:54.415
That's it!

01:18:55.284 --> 01:18:58.015
No mercy!

01:19:02.391 --> 01:19:07.694
This ain't no nursery-school
battle of wits anymore.

01:19:07.997 --> 01:19:13.435
This is my five foot, ten inches
of guile, gut and gristle

01:19:13.503 --> 01:19:19.203
versus your two and a half feet
of goo-goos, Ga-gas and giggles.

01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:26.178
If the Mil...

01:19:33.490 --> 01:19:36.288
If the Milwaukee Mob couldn't kill me,

01:19:36.393 --> 01:19:42.491
no milk-puking little thumb-sucker's
got a candle's chance in a cyclone

01:19:42.599 --> 01:19:44.830
of gettin' the better of me.

01:19:50.041 --> 01:19:52.100
Where are you going?

01:19:56.247 --> 01:19:58.113
Come back here.

01:20:01.152 --> 01:20:04.519
This isn't funny anymore.

01:20:07.759 --> 01:20:10.227
My money!

01:22:10.753 --> 01:22:12.448
What?

01:22:12.521 --> 01:22:15.319
I thought I saw a baby
crawl around the corner.

01:22:17.628 --> 01:22:19.686
Good night, Donald.

01:22:55.934 --> 01:22:57.992
Norby!

01:22:59.137 --> 01:23:01.127
Veeko!

01:23:02.606 --> 01:23:05.837
Ed! We're down here!

01:23:13.752 --> 01:23:15.845
Hey, Ed!

01:23:17.857 --> 01:23:20.290
We better go before I dry!

01:23:21.227 --> 01:23:24.162
Ed, can you see the baby from up there?

01:23:25.131 --> 01:23:29.067
Just hang on and we'll come on up.
I got an idea.

01:23:39.845 --> 01:23:43.782
We got some news. I don't know
if it's good, but it's not bad.

01:23:43.883 --> 01:23:46.750
Since the media broke the story,
calls have come in.

01:23:46.953 --> 01:23:50.514
There was a report of a man
looking for a baby on a bus this morning.

01:23:50.891 --> 01:23:54.156
A baby missing from
a department store care center.

01:23:55.462 --> 01:23:58.260
Another, at three o'clock, at the zoo.

01:23:58.332 --> 01:24:02.268
Shortly after that at a downtown park.
And a final report not long ago at...

01:24:02.336 --> 01:24:05.896
- A building under construction.
- Yeah, that's right.

01:24:08.475 --> 01:24:10.739
He's doing everything in the book.

01:24:15.682 --> 01:24:17.742
I know where he is.

01:24:18.853 --> 01:24:21.219
"Before returning home for supper,

01:24:21.289 --> 01:24:26.955
Nanny and Baby Boo stopped at
the Old Soldiers' Home to visit Mr Tinsel."

01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:29.528
That's where he is.

01:25:26.823 --> 01:25:28.882
Come on over.

01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:33.028
It's the kid, on television!
The one that...

01:25:38.568 --> 01:25:41.366
Come on. That's it. Come on.

01:26:53.846 --> 01:26:55.905
Baby.

01:27:19.239 --> 01:27:21.537
You had quite an adventure today.

01:27:21.642 --> 01:27:23.507
Boo-boo.

01:27:26.313 --> 01:27:27.299
Boo-boo?

01:27:27.312 --> 01:27:30.306
It's what he calls his book.
He lost it today.

01:27:30.417 --> 01:27:33.876
We'll get you another one, sweetheart.

01:27:37.025 --> 01:27:38.355
What?

01:27:40.328 --> 01:27:42.058
What?

01:27:42.131 --> 01:27:44.793
Oh, I see. That's nice.

01:27:46.267 --> 01:27:49.464
That's not a boo-boo.
That's a clock. A ticktock.

01:27:49.537 --> 01:27:52.563
- Was there a ticktock in his book?
- No.

01:27:55.144 --> 01:27:57.704
Well, he's pointing to...

01:27:59.515 --> 01:28:03.848
His boo-boo. He's not pointing
at the ticktock. He wants his boo-boo.

01:28:03.918 --> 01:28:08.821
- I thought he was getting a new boo-boo.
- He means his boo-boo's back there.

01:28:10.459 --> 01:28:16.056
Radio Rogers and McCloskey. Tell them we're
going to the ticktock to get the boo-boo.

01:28:16.132 --> 01:28:18.032
And send for backup.

01:29:10.823 --> 01:29:16.318
Hey, Eddie, you sure you don't wanna
go check to see if they left the money?

01:29:16.427 --> 01:29:18.987
Oh, that's a good idea.

01:29:19.063 --> 01:29:22.329
We get the living hell
tore out of us by a baby!

01:29:22.501 --> 01:29:27.267
Three fully grown men versus
15 pounds of pink flesh with a mouth.

01:29:27.538 --> 01:29:29.795
What chance have we
got of strolling into

01:29:29.807 --> 01:29:32.239
that alley and coming
out with anything less

01:29:32.312 --> 01:29:35.836
- than 140 years in prison?
- No way.

01:29:35.913 --> 01:29:38.007
No, thank you!

01:29:38.083 --> 01:29:42.521
This is a hexed situation.
We walk away while we're still ahead.

01:29:42.621 --> 01:29:45.454
We took a lickin' and kept on tickin'.

01:29:45.525 --> 01:29:47.254
We'll go back to banks.

01:29:47.527 --> 01:29:50.927
Dealing with grownups.
I don't want no kiddy stuff.

01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:55.364
- We did all right with banks.
- Or a convenience store once in a while.

01:29:55.467 --> 01:29:58.954
You know, one thing I
learned from all this:

01:29:58.967 --> 01:30:02.465
I ain't never gonna have
any kids of my own.

01:30:04.576 --> 01:30:07.358
Yeah, seeing as you burnt
down the only tree

01:30:07.371 --> 01:30:10.039
in your forest, I
wouldn't worry about it.

01:30:12.453 --> 01:30:14.250
Why don't you shut up?

01:30:14.722 --> 01:30:19.716
I don't wanna ever hear another word
about that rotten, snake-bit baby.

01:30:22.263 --> 01:30:23.924
I'm serious!

01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:31.864
I'm hearing that little
vermin in my thoughts.

01:30:31.938 --> 01:30:34.373
I wanna erase him from my mind.

01:30:37.212 --> 01:30:39.338
Did you hear that?

01:30:40.282 --> 01:30:43.376
- Yeah.
- You know what it sounds like?

01:31:01.570 --> 01:31:03.936
He's back.

01:31:26.662 --> 01:31:29.358
You dirty, no-good little stool pigeon!

01:31:29.465 --> 01:31:32.866
You're surrounded. Throw down the boo-boo.

01:31:37.774 --> 01:31:40.470
And put your hands over your heads.

01:32:24.055 --> 01:32:26.114
This is the end of the story.

01:32:52.751 --> 01:32:54.685
Good night, sweetheart.

01:32:55.354 --> 01:32:57.413
Good night, Bink.

01:33:05.498 --> 01:33:09.764
<i>Did I tell you? The baby's
having his picture taken tomorrow.</i>

01:33:09.869 --> 01:33:12.838
<i>- Say hello to old Willy.
- I will.</i>
