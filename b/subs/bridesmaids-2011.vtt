Yeah, but, l mean,
they still stay
who they are, pretty much.

all the time.

from who we are,

talk to you guys about

l was thinking it
could be French-themed,

since she's always wanted
to go to Paris her whole life.

38:53.748 --> 38:56.750

could bring Paris here

38:56.917 --> 38:59.919
and have champagne
and little cookies.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.504
They'd say "Lillian
and Dougie" on them.

39:01.630 --> 39:03.173
We can dip them in
chocolate fondue,

39:03.257 --> 39:05.925
and get cheese from
the nice part of the store.

39:06.302 --> 39:07.802

Good idea, Annie.

French invitations,

personally, the Paris theme's

39:18.939 --> 39:20.940
a bit,
"Been there, done that."

39:21.108 --> 39:22.400
l just feel
like we can top it.

39:22.485 --> 39:23.860
We should throw
some ideas around.

39:23.944 --> 39:26.154

has a theme they had in mind

39:26.238 --> 39:27.781
or something
they'd been thinking of.

39:28.240 --> 39:30.116

a Pixar-themed shower?

That poor girl, Lillian,
who we're all here for,

40:13.285 --> 40:15.662
is in the bathroom
probably bawling her
fucking eyes out.

40:15.955 --> 40:17.831

"Holy shit!

the rest of my life
with Doug."

agree on that, right?

upstage Lillian

just get something
kind of simple.

1:33:57.381 --> 1:33:59.507
Okay, we're coming. . .
We're coming in.

1:33:59.592 --> 1:34:01.968
Everybody is in
and having fun.

1:34:02.136 --> 1:34:04.387
We're having fun.
And heel ! We're heeling.

1:34:05.097 --> 1:34:06.097
Heel !

1:34:06.557 --> 1:34:07.974
How many of
those did you take?

1:34:08.100 --> 1:34:10.769
l took nine.

1:34:10.936 --> 1:34:15.690
Yeah, l did
slightly over-commit
to the whole dog thing.

1:34:15.775 --> 1:34:18.693
lt turns out, l'm probably
more comfortable with six.

1:34:18.861 --> 1:34:21.946
lt's a lot. . . That's
a lot of energy to deal with.

1:34:22.114 --> 1:34:23.698
But you wouldn't know
anything about that,

1:34:23.824 --> 1:34:25.408
because you haven't
been returning my calls.

1:34:27.078 --> 1:34:29.120
And say what, Megan?

1:34:29.205 --> 1:34:32.165
Say, "Hi, l can't
get off the couch.

1:34:32.375 --> 1:34:35.835
"l got fired from my job.
l got kicked out
of my apartment.

"l don't have any friends.
The last time l. . ."

1:34:41.884 --> 1:34:44.219
You know what l
find interesting
about that, Annie?

1:34:44.303 --> 1:34:47.263
lt's interesting to me
that you have
absolutely no friends.

1:34:47.348 --> 1:34:48.807
You know why
it's interesting?

1:34:48.974 --> 1:34:50.308
Here's a friend
standing directly

1:34:50.434 --> 1:34:51.810
in front of you,
trying to talk to you.

1:34:51.936 --> 1:34:53.353
And you choose to
talk about the fact

1:34:53.479 --> 1:34:54.896
that you don't
have any friends.

1:34:54.980 --> 1:34:56.356
You know what l mean.

1:34:56.482 --> 1:34:57.857
No, l don't think
you want any help.

1:34:57.942 --> 1:34:59.984
l think you want to
have a little pity party.
That's not true.

1:35:00.069 --> 1:35:02.153
l think Annie wants
a little pity party.

1:35:02.279 --> 1:35:04.322
You're an asshole, Annie!
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

1:35:04.407 --> 1:35:06.991
You're an asshole. l'm life.
ls life bothering you?

1:35:07.076 --> 1:35:08.118
Yes! What are you doing?

l'm life, Annie.
l'm life, Annie.

1:35:09.537 --> 1:35:11.955
You have got to
fight back on life.

1:35:12.039 --> 1:35:13.289
Megan !

1:35:13.416 --> 1:35:14.666
You better learn to fight.

Megan !

1:35:16.001 --> 1:35:17.794

l'm trying to get you to fight
for your shitty life,
and you won't do it!

1:35:27.179 --> 1:35:28.221
You just won't do it.
Stop it.

1:35:28.472 --> 1:35:30.640
You stop slapping yourself.
Stop slapping yourself.

All right.

l'm glad to see
you've got a little
bit of spark in you.

1:35:44.780 --> 1:35:46.656
l knew that Annie
was in there somewhere.

1:35:47.032 --> 1:35:48.491
l think. . .

1:35:48.659 --> 1:35:51.995
l think you're ready now
to hear a little
story about a girl.

1:35:52.163 --> 1:35:54.205
A girl named Megan.

1:35:54.373 --> 1:35:55.874
A girl named
Megan that didn't have

1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:57.542
a very good time
in high school.

1:35:57.710 --> 1:36:00.795
l'm referring to
myself when l say "Megan."

1:36:00.963 --> 1:36:02.881
lt's me, Megan.
Yeah, l got that.

1:36:03.048 --> 1:36:04.549
l know you look at
me now and think,

1:36:04.633 --> 1:36:06.593
"Boy, she must have
breezed through high school."

1:36:06.677 --> 1:36:08.219
Not the case, Annie.

1:36:08.304 --> 1:36:12.140
No, this was not easy
going up and down the halls.
Okay?

1:36:12.224 --> 1:36:13.808
They used to
try to blow me up.

1:36:13.934 --> 1:36:15.518
They threw
firecrackers at my head.

1:36:16.145 --> 1:36:17.145
Firecrackers.

1:36:17.521 --> 1:36:19.939
l mean literally.
l'm not saying
that figuratively.

1:36:20.024 --> 1:36:22.734
l got firecrackers
thrown at my head.
They called me a freak.

1:36:23.277 --> 1:36:24.527
Do you think l
let that break me?

1:36:24.945 --> 1:36:27.238
Do you think l went home
to my mommy, crying,

1:36:27.323 --> 1:36:30.074
"l don't have any friends.
Megan doesn't
have any friends"?

1:36:30.159 --> 1:36:32.535
No, l did not.
You know what l did?

1:36:32.620 --> 1:36:35.121
l pulled myself up,
l studied really hard.

1:36:35.206 --> 1:36:37.373
l read every book in
the library. And now?

1:36:37.458 --> 1:36:38.875
l work for the government.
l have

1:36:39.001 --> 1:36:40.418
the highest possible
security clearance.

Don't repeat that!
l won't.

1:36:42.129 --> 1:36:43.171
l can't protect you.

1:36:43.464 --> 1:36:45.715

all the nukes are
and l know the codes.

1:36:47.718 --> 1:36:48.760
l won't say anything.

1:36:49.011 --> 1:36:51.137
You would be amazed.

1:36:51.388 --> 1:36:52.722
A lot of shopping malls.

Don't repeat that!

1:36:54.266 --> 1:36:55.517
l won't.

1:36:55.684 --> 1:36:56.768
l have six houses.

1:36:57.144 --> 1:37:00.188
l bought an 1 8-wheeler
a couple of months
ago just because l could.

1:37:00.272 --> 1:37:01.481
Okay, you lost Lillian.

1:37:01.565 --> 1:37:02.899
You got another best friend

if you would notice.

1:37:05.569 --> 1:37:06.611
Huh?

1:37:06.695 --> 1:37:08.404
Now, you got to stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

associate with people

for their problems.

over everything, and

everything's got
out of control.

1:48:46.436 --> 1:48:49.313
And my dad can't
afford the wedding.

1:48:50.273 --> 1:48:53.734
This has been really
hard to do without you.

Nope. l'm sorry.

you out of my wedding.

No, it's my fault.

l think l'm the one
with the mental problems.

1:49:13.964 --> 1:49:15.172
Yeah, wasn't it my
turn to be crazy?

1:49:15.298 --> 1:49:16.549
The bride's
supposed to be crazy.

1:49:16.633 --> 1:49:17.633
Yes, technically.

1:49:17.884 --> 1:49:20.636
You kind of
stole all the crazy.
l out-crazied you.

1:49:22.889 --> 1:49:24.306
Everything's
going to be okay.

1:49:24.558 --> 1:49:26.767
Yeah? How do you know that?

1:49:29.771 --> 1:49:32.314
l left the rehearsal
dinner last night.

1:49:32.482 --> 1:49:34.608
l told Dougie l
had to go get Q-tips.

1:49:34.776 --> 1:49:36.151
And

1:49:37.237 --> 1:49:40.364
all of a sudden,
l realized l was
driving here.

1:49:40.448 --> 1:49:41.532
l came here.

1:49:44.244 --> 1:49:48.414
l realized this
is the last time
l'm going to be here

1:49:48.582 --> 1:49:50.291
in this apartment

1:49:50.458 --> 1:49:51.709
with that couch,

1:49:52.085 --> 1:49:53.335
and this bed,

1:49:53.503 --> 1:49:55.421
and take a bath in my bathtub.

1:49:55.589 --> 1:49:57.423
Because you know
how much l love my bathtub.

1:49:57.674 --> 1:49:58.632
lt's a good tub.

1:49:58.758 --> 1:50:01.385
l slept in there on my
30th birthday, remember?
Uh-huh.

Everything's gonna change.

going to get to

minutes away from you.

1:50:12.856 --> 1:50:14.481

1:50:18.987 --> 1:50:19.987
Well, don't be.

1:50:20.614 --> 1:50:23.574
Don't be sad.
Because things
are going to change,

1:50:23.658 --> 1:50:27.119
but they'll be better.

1:50:28.830 --> 1:50:30.039

You're gonna take
this huge, great,
beautiful step.

1:50:35.003 --> 1:50:37.296
And Dougie loves you
more than anything.

1:50:38.465 --> 1:50:39.632
And so do l.

1:50:43.762 --> 1:50:46.430

What's gonna happen to you?

to blaze the trail for me.

1:51:10.497 --> 1:51:13.415
And then report back
and tell me what's coming.

lt was beautiful. Yeah.

1:55:53.404 --> 1:55:55.530
What did you

Helen, it was really

1:56:20.014 --> 1:56:21.640
Hey, you know, maybe

1:56:21.724 --> 1:56:25.394
sometime the three of us
could go to
Rockin' Sushi together.

1:56:27.188 --> 1:56:30.065
Thank you, Annie.

1:56:30.233 --> 1:56:31.900
l would love that.

1:56:38.282 --> 1:56:40.242
Your ride is here.

1:56:56.634 --> 1:56:58.593
Hey, how did everything go?

1:57:00.805 --> 1:57:01.888
Strangely well.

1:57:02.015 --> 1:57:03.098
Good.

1:57:06.102 --> 1:57:07.728
So, l ate your cake

1:57:08.730 --> 1:57:10.147
that you left.

1:57:10.273 --> 1:57:11.273
You did?
Yeah.

1:57:11.482 --> 1:57:12.691
l mean, l had to
fight some raccoons off.

1:57:13.735 --> 1:57:15.944
But that's okay.
l'm pretty strong and tough,

1:57:16.070 --> 1:57:18.280
so it wasn't
much of a contest.

1:57:18.448 --> 1:57:19.531
So that might have been. . .

1:57:19.615 --> 1:57:20.949
l'm just going to
kiss you now
rather than just. . .

1:57:35.423 --> 1:57:36.423
Oh ! l'm on duty.

1:57:37.258 --> 1:57:38.884
And l need to
put my uniform on.

1:57:38.968 --> 1:57:40.886
lf l drive like this,
they're gonna think
l just stole a car,

1:57:40.970 --> 1:57:42.137
which wouldn't be great.

1:57:43.431 --> 1:57:45.807
You could ride
with me if you want.

1:57:45.975 --> 1:57:47.934
You want to come?
Yeah, l do.

1:57:48.144 --> 1:57:49.186
Come on.

1:57:49.270 --> 1:57:50.270
All right.

1:57:50.438 --> 1:57:51.480
Whoa! Whoa!
Where are you going?

1:57:51.606 --> 1:57:52.647
l'm getting in the car.

1:57:52.732 --> 1:57:54.399
No, no, no, you got
to get in the back.
What?

1:57:54.567 --> 1:57:56.735
You can't sit in the front,
it's against regulations.

1:57:56.819 --> 1:57:58.904
Come on. Come on.

1:57:59.072 --> 1:58:00.781
You're going to make
me sit in the back seat?

1:58:00.990 --> 1:58:02.240
Yeah, come on.

1:58:02.325 --> 1:58:03.408
(EXCLAlMS)
Sorry. Habit.

1:58:03.743 --> 1:58:04.993
All right.

1:58:05.119 --> 1:58:06.328
lt's a force of habit.

1:58:10.124 --> 1:58:11.500
Can l please get
in the front seat?

1:58:11.667 --> 1:58:14.669
Actually, no, l'm afraid
there's a warrant
out for your arrest.

1:58:14.837 --> 1:58:16.505
What? Why?

1:58:16.589 --> 1:58:19.257
Reckless driving,
littering, texting,

1:58:19.425 --> 1:58:21.343
consuming alcohol
while operating a vehicle.

1:58:21.511 --> 1:58:22.552
You didn't
think l was going to

1:58:22.637 --> 1:58:24.221
let you get away
with that, did you?

1:58:25.014 --> 1:58:27.265
Could we put the siren on?
Please?

1:58:33.106 --> 1:58:35.023

1:58:35.108 --> 1:58:37.484
But you hold

1:58:37.652 --> 1:58:41.196

1:58:55.169 --> 1:58:57.379

around and say goodbye

1:58:57.547 --> 1:58:59.548
Until then, baby,
are you going to let them

1:58:59.674 --> 1:59:01.633
hold you down
and make you cry?

1:59:01.801 --> 1:59:02.801
Don't you know

1:59:02.969 --> 1:59:04.219
Don't you know
things can change

1:59:04.387 --> 1:59:06.221
Things'll go your way

1:59:06.389 --> 1:59:08.723
