Our story is set
when the Bad Guys were still bad, okay?

00:42.917 --> 00:46.296
And at the best time of the year,
when all the good heists can be had.

No guards, no fuzz.

01:05.774 --> 01:08.151
This city's our heisting stage!

01:08.234 --> 01:10.320
And we're gonna clean it out.

Oh, it's a Bad Guys tradition.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.040
No reason. I-I don't even like it.

01:23.166 --> 01:26.127

02:34.863 --> 02:36.406

This isn't that famous balloon everybody's
freakishly emotionally attached to, is it?

Our beloved Big Nick has been destroyed

We're a city in mourning this morning.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.446

03:58.529 --> 04:02.116
Why indeed.
It's a senseless act of bah-humbuggery.

04:02.200 --> 04:06.329
All attempts to wash the abomination off
have only made it more terrifying,

04:06.412 --> 04:08.539

like Christmas in the city.

It's just not the holidays
without Big Nick. [sniffles]

This can't be happening!

04:33.815 --> 04:35.483
The whole point of Christmas morning

04:35.566 --> 04:38.820
is that no one is around
to stop us from maximum heisting!

04:38.903 --> 04:41.406
B-b-but we were gonna rob the bank!

04:41.489 --> 04:43.866
And now we can't
because of some dumb Santa?

04:43.950 --> 04:46.286
[gasps] You take that back right now!

04:46.369 --> 04:48.705
Santa is a criminal hero
who deserves our respect,

04:48.788 --> 04:50.206

04:50.290 --> 04:53.167
He's broken into more homes than anyone
and never been caught.

04:53.251 --> 04:55.461
What's even the point of anything?

04:55.545 --> 04:57.714
Unless... And hear me out on this.

04:57.797 --> 05:01.301
If we set our clocks back 24 hours
and go to sleep right now,

05:01.384 --> 05:04.220
maybe, when we wake up,
none of this will have happened.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.180
Yeah? Come on. Night, night!

05:06.764 --> 05:09.851
If destroying the Santa balloon
was all it took to cancel Christmas,

05:42.759 --> 05:45.011
[Webs] The normies will forget
about their balloon

05:45.094 --> 05:47.221
once they lay their eyes on this beaut.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.265
And it captures Santa's true nature.

05:49.348 --> 05:51.142
None of that jolly business.

05:51.225 --> 05:53.561
The suit
really should be operated by a driver.

05:53.644 --> 05:54.937
Come on. Wolfie, try him on.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.690
Oh, that's... Uh, I'm good. Thanks, though.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.859
And as great as this is,

05:59.942 --> 06:03.446
the jolly component
of Jolly Old Saint Nick

06:03.529 --> 06:06.407
is probably
why non-criminal folks like him.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.576
[whispering] Don't listen. You're perfect.

06:08.659 --> 06:09.786
If we all work together,

06:09.869 --> 06:14.624
I'm sure a bunch of criminal masterminds
like us can make one silly Santa balloon.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.256
Even I'm a little offended by this.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.761
[Piranha] His beard looks like a tentacle.

06:27.386 --> 06:28.805
I feel scandalized.

06:29.472 --> 06:32.225
Okay, lost some time there,
but we'll figure out another way

06:32.308 --> 06:34.727
to cheer up the city
in time to rob it in the morning.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.355
Which, sure, is in, like, 12 hours,
so lay it on me.

06:37.438 --> 06:39.690
What else says holiday spirit?

06:39.774 --> 06:43.820
Stealing whatever we want, because,
normally, guards take the day off.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.738
But no, not this year.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.783
They'll be at work, ruining
the only good thing about Christmas.

06:48.866 --> 06:50.201

and wears a dress to bed.

07:03.673 --> 07:07.593
And yet,
his story has never been properly told.

07:07.677 --> 07:11.222
So I propose that we put on a show
for the whole city,

07:11.305 --> 07:15.226
with me as Scrooge...
and all the other characters.

07:15.309 --> 07:19.939
But without that needy,
nefarious Tiny Tim tearing Scrooge down!

07:20.022 --> 07:21.816
And I would buy a ticket to that show,

07:21.899 --> 07:24.735

is getting a lump of coal.

like I'm making good choices, you know?

- You're a genius!
- I am?

07:39.876 --> 07:43.129
- We're going to play Santa.
- No, no, no. Let me get this straight.

07:43.212 --> 07:46.883
Are you suggesting we give
instead of take?

07:46.966 --> 07:48.092
Think of it this way.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.761
We'll steal the gifts
from the big department store,

07:50.845 --> 07:53.389
and then break into houses to leave them.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.808
That sounds a lot like Robin Hood,

07:55.892 --> 07:58.269
who is notoriously good.

07:58.352 --> 08:01.105
Ugh! That guy's the worst.
He ruined tights for me.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.899
We're doing good for the greater bad.

08:02.982 --> 08:06.777
If folks have presents waiting for them,
they'll stay home on Christmas morning,

08:06.861 --> 08:09.572
and our Holiday Heist-tacular
can live again.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.742
Uh, yeah.
Uh, we also have to deal with this.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.453
[heavy metal music blaring]

08:15.536 --> 08:17.246
[yelling] After the balloon incident,

08:17.330 --> 08:20.249
the radio station
stopped playing Christmas music,

08:20.333 --> 08:25.713
and is broadcasting
something called Doom Tunes instead!

08:25.796 --> 08:27.048
- Huh?
- Huh?

08:27.131 --> 08:30.635
- [music stops]

08:30.718 --> 08:33.471
If someone can
get into the recording studio to help,

08:33.554 --> 08:36.933
I could hack the station's antenna
and stream my sweet Santa mix.

08:37.016 --> 08:38.601
Good idea, Webs.

08:38.684 --> 08:42.480
All right, guys. Let's go do some good,
so we can be bad.

08:45.566 --> 08:46.776
Here's the plan.

08:46.859 --> 08:50.279

so she can hack it.

and distract the DJ</i>

<i>so she doesn't notice Webs is
taking over the feed with holiday music.</i>

08:56.869 --> 09:00.164
<i>Finally, Snake and I will steal gifts
from the department store,</i>

09:00.248 --> 09:03.376
<i>to then break in
and leave them in unsuspecting houses.</i>

Unless it's that annoying brat, Tiny Tim.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.409
This should be a breeze.

All you have to do is
break into the house and leave it.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.955
[hisses] Fine.

[heist music playing]

09:48.087 --> 09:50.923
Well, I definitely did it. We can go now.

[Wolf chuckles]

10:25.207 --> 10:29.337
Get ready to sign off...
'cause I've been itching for a fight.
