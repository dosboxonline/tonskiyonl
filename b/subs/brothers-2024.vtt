09:53.916 --> 09:55.458
It's just a phone call.

09:57.291 --> 09:59.291
I know where I stand.

09:59.375 --> 10:00.583
Yeah.

10:00.666 --> 10:04.333
And remember,
you have some emeralds to deliver.

10:09.208 --> 10:12.666
I'll stay in touch.

10:15.166 --> 10:17.333
[Moke] Don't get me wrong,
running three restaurants is great,

10:17.416 --> 10:21.291
but I think I'm more, like,
regional manager material.

10:21.375 --> 10:22.708
I mean, I could be making, like, 125,000--

10:22.791 --> 10:25.916
-Hey, babe, you'll get the party platter?
-[Moke] I'm sorry, say what?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.416
The party platter.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.833
Uh, yep. And sides.

10:29.916 --> 10:31.583
-And ice, please.
-Ice.

10:31.666 --> 10:32.833
-Yep.
-But not the crushed kind.

10:32.916 --> 10:35.750
My dad hates the crushed ice
'cause it melts too fast.

10:35.833 --> 10:37.416
Copy that. Uh, cubes, not crushed.

10:37.500 --> 10:38.541
-[Abby sighs]
-Cubes, cubes.

10:38.625 --> 10:40.125
I hate that I'm nervous.

10:40.208 --> 10:43.791
That he makes me nervous,
like our house is a report card.

10:43.875 --> 10:47.083
Abs, it's gonna be fine.
We're gonna do this together.

10:47.166 --> 10:49.875
[sighs] And you'll talk to Swofford?

10:49.958 --> 10:52.000
Yeah, Daryl got a raise after nine months.

10:52.083 --> 10:54.833
I've been there a year.
I'm good. I'm good.

10:54.916 --> 10:56.708
[pop music playing quietly over speakers]

10:56.791 --> 10:58.416
Fired?

10:58.500 --> 10:59.916
Uh, yes. Thank you, Daryl.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.750
Mm-hmm.

11:01.833 --> 11:02.916
I don't-- [stammers]

11:03.000 --> 11:05.291
We just bought a house.
We're having a kid.

11:05.375 --> 11:08.916
I mean, in-insurance?
I don't understand. Who called?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.500
Uh, it's the Bureau of, uh...

11:10.583 --> 11:12.833
it was the Labor and Employment Bureau

11:12.916 --> 11:15.625
doing a survey
on prior offenders in food service.

11:15.708 --> 11:19.625
You... you didn't disclose your records
when you applied.

11:22.958 --> 11:26.041
I was gonna get a party platter.

11:26.125 --> 11:27.708
You can still do that.

11:27.791 --> 11:31.000
You just won't get
the employee discount 'cause...

11:31.083 --> 11:32.416
you don't work here anymore.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.083
Okay.

11:35.833 --> 11:37.791
I wanted to talk to you about...

11:39.333 --> 11:41.291
...maybe being promoted.

11:41.375 --> 11:43.500
[lighthearted music playing]

11:46.416 --> 11:48.750
[Jady] And I'm telling you,
I thought it was "Peace Corpse,"

11:48.833 --> 11:51.291
-and I was gonna be saving dead people.
-[Abby laughs] Peace Corps.

11:51.375 --> 11:54.291
-[Jady] Oh, my God, you ordered a clown.
-[laughing]

11:54.375 --> 11:57.125
-Hi. [laughs]
-Nice shirt, bro.

11:58.666 --> 11:59.916
[Abby clears throat]

12:01.250 --> 12:03.250
-[birds chirping]
-[playful chatter in distance]

12:11.791 --> 12:13.375
You quit?

12:13.458 --> 12:15.125
Yeah.

12:15.208 --> 12:17.666
Good for you, man.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.083
It's not for me.

12:20.166 --> 12:22.916
-She seems great.
-She is great.

12:24.541 --> 12:26.458
Listen, um...

12:27.583 --> 12:29.416
Back then, you know,

12:29.500 --> 12:32.291
I ta-- I talked with Freddie Unk
at the legal clinic, and...

12:33.791 --> 12:36.375
...he suggested
I just stay away from the trial.

12:36.458 --> 12:38.875
Like, don't get near it.

12:38.958 --> 12:40.791
Hmm.

12:40.875 --> 12:42.791
He also say don't visit

12:42.875 --> 12:45.666
or don't call? [chuckles]

12:45.750 --> 12:48.750
I mean, you ghosted me, man.

12:56.125 --> 12:57.875
How'd you cut your bid?

12:57.958 --> 13:01.583
There's a crooked screw in there
named Farful. His dad's a judge.

13:01.666 --> 13:05.083
Let's just say I cut a low-key deal to

13:05.166 --> 13:07.125
vacate my conviction.

13:07.208 --> 13:09.083
What'd you do?

13:09.166 --> 13:10.875
Bought a score from a lifer,

13:10.958 --> 13:13.500
pitched Farful 50%
if he could tap his dad for me.

13:13.583 --> 13:15.791
-[groans]
-It's a low-key job.

13:15.875 --> 13:18.291
Garment shop. Cash on site.

13:18.375 --> 13:20.291
Old floor safe.

13:20.375 --> 13:23.208
You could rip that open like wet bread.

13:23.291 --> 13:24.666
No.

13:26.208 --> 13:28.458
Like I said, low-key.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.250
Look, here's what's up.

13:30.333 --> 13:35.000
I'm having a housewarming-
slash-baby-shower-type deal today,

13:35.083 --> 13:37.083
and you can have barbecue or ice cream,

13:37.166 --> 13:39.625
whatever it is you want,
and then just go on your way,

13:39.708 --> 13:42.625
and don't ever mention this
crazy shit to me again.

13:45.833 --> 13:47.208
But our end would be low seven.

13:47.291 --> 13:49.416
I'm not that guy anymore.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.083
But I don't want to do it without you.

13:51.166 --> 13:52.666
I guess you can't do it, then.

13:58.625 --> 14:00.041
-[door opens]
-[Moke] Hey.

14:00.125 --> 14:03.041
Baby, look at you.

14:03.125 --> 14:05.083
-You're radiant.
-Hi.
-Dr. Jacobson.

14:05.166 --> 14:06.500
-Michael.
-How's the hotel?

14:06.583 --> 14:08.291
It's... sufficient.

14:08.375 --> 14:09.541
-All right.
-All right.

14:09.625 --> 14:11.250
Okay.

14:11.333 --> 14:12.333
Avery.

14:13.708 --> 14:18.375
So, Mike's ears were, like,
so messed up as a kid,

14:18.458 --> 14:21.333
he was basically deaf
until he was about ten years old,

14:21.416 --> 14:24.291
that he couldn't pronounce "J.T.,"
so he said "Jady."

14:24.375 --> 14:25.500
Like, "Jady."

14:25.583 --> 14:27.375
And I couldn't say "Mike,"

14:27.458 --> 14:29.875
so I said "Moke," but that's,
you know, just because I'm lazy.

14:29.958 --> 14:31.000
-[chuckles]
-Moke?

14:31.083 --> 14:33.041
How have I never heard about this?

14:33.125 --> 14:34.500
Ashamed of his past.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.708
Oh, come on, Moke, I didn't tell 'em
about the goblin mask

14:37.791 --> 14:40.500
and the coins and the police. [chuckles]

14:40.583 --> 14:42.291
Really?

14:48.625 --> 14:50.083
The fuck!

14:50.166 --> 14:51.375
[clears throat]

14:51.458 --> 14:53.125
-[bottle opens]
-'Sup?

14:54.458 --> 14:56.458
-'Sup?
-[bottle cap clatters]

14:56.541 --> 15:00.458
So we're like brothers-in-laws-in-laws.

15:00.541 --> 15:02.500
Yeah. Yeah.

15:02.583 --> 15:04.625
I'm adopted, though.

15:04.708 --> 15:07.666
That's cool, man. That's cool.

15:08.750 --> 15:10.291
-You want to get high?
-Yep.

15:10.375 --> 15:13.291
[♪ The Friends of Distinction:
"Grazing in the Grass"]

15:13.375 --> 15:15.791
Oh, that's pretty great qual--
that's-- Yes.

15:15.875 --> 15:16.875
[laughing]

15:16.958 --> 15:18.875
What? [chuckles] Shut up.

15:18.958 --> 15:21.541
-[birds chirping]
-These birds around here, man.

15:21.625 --> 15:23.541
[laughing]

15:23.625 --> 15:25.958
[Dr. Jacobson] You're not just providing
for yourself anymore, Michael.

15:26.041 --> 15:29.666
A-A college education can run
a million plus these days.

15:29.750 --> 15:31.833
[sniffs] Mm.

15:31.916 --> 15:33.875
-[Avery laughing]
-[Jady] Stop, man.

15:33.958 --> 15:36.583
-No, dude.
-No, helicopters are not cool.

15:36.666 --> 15:40.125
-Avery Stuart Jacobson!
-Oh, let me be alive!

15:40.208 --> 15:41.375
Oh, Moke, he's recycling.

15:41.458 --> 15:42.583
Fuckin'--

15:42.666 --> 15:44.458
I'm gonna kick your ass,
you stupid stoner!

15:44.541 --> 15:45.541
-[Jady screams]
-[grunts]

15:45.625 --> 15:48.875
[Jady] Run for the mountains,
brother-in-law!

15:48.958 --> 15:50.375
[neighbors murmuring]

15:50.458 --> 15:52.166
-[Abby] Seriously, you guys?
-[Jady] So much anger!

15:52.250 --> 15:54.416
-[Moke] You're ruining my baby shower!
-[neighbors laughing]

15:54.500 --> 15:56.958
Trying to look impressive,
and you're embarrassing me!

15:57.041 --> 15:58.250
[Jady] I'm so high right now.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.791
It's like wrestling a jelly doughnut!

16:02.083 --> 16:03.250
[bag rustles sharply]

16:06.416 --> 16:08.833
That was the opposite
of what I need right now.

16:08.916 --> 16:10.916
I'm sorry. I overreacted.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
It's why-why I didn't want him to stay.

16:14.083 --> 16:15.916
Oh, you're going with this is my fault?
That's your strategy?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.666
No, I just...

16:18.750 --> 16:21.083
Jady wasn't in the Peace Corps.

16:21.166 --> 16:23.083
No shit, babe.

16:23.166 --> 16:26.041
No tan, soft hands,
stick and poke on his neck?

16:26.125 --> 16:29.250
What was he locked up for?

16:29.333 --> 16:30.916
Burglary.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.166
And... assault.

16:34.250 --> 16:37.208
-Look, he and I, years ago--
-Hey. I know.

16:37.291 --> 16:39.458
You went over the speed limit a bit.
So did I.

16:39.541 --> 16:43.625
Neither of us were perfect,
but we can be better now.

16:43.708 --> 16:45.125
For each other.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
And for Blueberry.

16:50.083 --> 16:51.583
For Blueberry, yeah.

16:51.666 --> 16:55.666
She does half the shit I did,
she's going to, like, military school.

16:55.750 --> 16:57.083
For nuns.

16:58.583 --> 17:00.166
Work it out with Jady.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.708
Or don't.

17:01.791 --> 17:04.375
Just don't bring this fucked-up energy
to the holiday.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
[dramatic music playing]

17:12.083 --> 17:14.083

Boo. [grunts]

17:40.625 --> 17:42.041
[Jady screams]

17:42.125 --> 17:44.208
[Farful muffled] Where is your phone?

17:44.291 --> 17:46.541
-[Jady gasping]
-Your phone now?

17:47.541 --> 17:49.625
[mocking gulps] Where's the phone?

17:49.708 --> 17:51.166
[gasping]

17:51.250 --> 17:53.083
Thank you.

17:53.166 --> 17:55.708
So, what's up?
You don't like your new phone?

17:55.791 --> 17:58.000
I-I li-- I like it. Huh?

17:58.083 --> 17:59.333
So, how come it's not on ya, huh?

17:59.416 --> 18:01.000
-Where'd you go?
-Nowhere. [stammers]

18:01.083 --> 18:03.583
Come on, Farful. I just got some grub.

18:04.666 --> 18:05.833
Eh.

18:05.916 --> 18:08.500
From now on, this stays with you.

18:08.583 --> 18:13.333
And when I say, "Call me,"
I want you to think of that like...

18:13.416 --> 18:17.333
like a little doggie would
when he hears me say, "Heel."

18:17.416 --> 18:21.041
And I don't mean at some point.
I don't mean in the future.

18:21.125 --> 18:25.291
What I do mean is, exactly at that moment
in time, you fucking call me!

18:28.000 --> 18:29.750
So we made a deal.

18:29.833 --> 18:31.208
Where are my emeralds?

18:31.291 --> 18:32.875
What's the holdup?

18:32.958 --> 18:34.541
Making arrangements.

18:34.625 --> 18:37.666
But it takes time.
I got to line up the talent.

18:37.750 --> 18:41.333
-Talent?
-Yeah, I can't do it all by myself.

18:41.416 --> 18:43.375
Specialists, you know,
come out of my pocket.

18:43.458 --> 18:45.625
Ah, what the fuck is that?

18:45.708 --> 18:47.708
Uzi! I got it online.

18:47.791 --> 18:49.541
Two one hundredths of a Bitcoin.

18:49.625 --> 18:50.833
Plus shipping.

18:50.916 --> 18:53.916
It's also a parole violation
in case it comes to that.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.750
See, my father has certain expectations.

18:56.833 --> 18:58.500
It's best if they're met.

18:59.666 --> 19:01.666
[grunts]

19:02.750 --> 19:04.875
Oh, um, one more thing.

19:04.958 --> 19:07.625
About those, uh, "specialists."

19:07.708 --> 19:10.875
You didn't say anything to them
about me, right?

19:10.958 --> 19:13.458
Course not.

19:13.541 --> 19:15.083
Good.

19:16.541 --> 19:18.291
Good doggie.

19:19.375 --> 19:22.625
[line ringing]

19:22.708 --> 19:23.958
[dispatcher echoing] Hello?

19:24.041 --> 19:25.541
911. What's your emergency?

19:25.625 --> 19:28.708
Hello? Yeah, please send
an ambulance at, uh, Reg--

19:28.791 --> 19:30.458
-What?
-Hello?

19:30.541 --> 19:31.875
-Ah, shit.
-Are you there?

19:31.958 --> 19:34.333
-What happened?
-It was the guy I told you about.

19:34.416 --> 19:37.291
-He just came over to pay me a visit...
-What is your emergency?

19:37.375 --> 19:39.625
...and had some fun on my face.

19:39.708 --> 19:43.416
[grunting] Oh, God. Fuck.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.916
-Hello? Sir?
-Calling an ambulance
like I'm some old lady.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.875
-It's embarrassing.
-You have 911 on the line.

19:48.958 --> 19:51.500
-[phone hangs up]
-Ow. [pants]

19:54.416 --> 19:56.416
[Jady cries softly]

19:56.500 --> 19:58.333
I mean, is this guy
gonna clip you, or what?

19:58.416 --> 20:00.375
Probably, maybe, maybe not.

20:00.458 --> 20:01.708
I don't know. [sniffles]

20:01.791 --> 20:05.583
I'm still paying the price
for getting copped in that warehouse, huh?

20:07.125 --> 20:09.708
Not all of us get second chances, I guess.

20:14.208 --> 20:16.208
[groans]

20:16.291 --> 20:17.291
Damn it.

20:19.458 --> 20:21.958
[sniffles, groans] Where?

20:22.041 --> 20:24.333
I don't know.
This guy, he probably lives in a tree.

20:24.416 --> 20:26.541
No, the safe. Where is the safe?

20:30.666 --> 20:32.875
Down in Chaplain, a day's drive.

20:33.958 --> 20:37.083
It's all doped. It's a milk run.

20:37.166 --> 20:38.333
One day.

20:39.708 --> 20:41.208
Tops.

55:48.875 --> 55:51.750
We were going down a dead end.

55:51.833 --> 55:53.833
I mean, you saw Glenn.

55:55.333 --> 55:58.708
If anything ever happened to you,

55:58.791 --> 56:00.625
I couldn't bear it.

56:00.708 --> 56:02.708
[gentle music playing]

56:06.125 --> 56:08.125
Why'd you really come back?

56:09.791 --> 56:11.541
For the money, right?

56:15.291 --> 56:17.541
Time's short, sweetie.

56:18.916 --> 56:21.583
Money's the only thing I could give you.

56:35.250 --> 56:36.625
[siren chirps]

56:37.625 --> 56:40.125
[car door opens, closes]

56:47.750 --> 56:49.958
Here, doggie, doggie.

56:56.333 --> 56:57.791
[Farful yells]

56:57.875 --> 57:00.208
-What did you do with it?
-[grunts] Fuck you.

57:00.291 --> 57:02.916
You buried it? You dug it up?

57:03.000 --> 57:04.708
I don't have it!

57:04.791 --> 57:07.000
-Where is it? Hmm?
-You should see a proctologist.

57:07.083 --> 57:08.375
They're somewhere up there, man.

57:08.458 --> 57:10.416
Last time I'm gonna ask you. [groans]

57:10.500 --> 57:12.125
Where is it?!

57:12.208 --> 57:13.416
What did you do with--

57:13.500 --> 57:15.250
[grunting]

57:19.208 --> 57:20.875
Whoa!

57:20.958 --> 57:22.291
Get him!

57:30.958 --> 57:32.291
[pained scream]

57:33.500 --> 57:36.083
Not so tough now, are you, tough guy?!

57:36.166 --> 57:38.541
-[panting]
-On your feet!

57:38.625 --> 57:41.125
Hands. Hands!

57:41.208 --> 57:43.000
[Moke] Ow.

57:43.083 --> 57:44.666
Hey. What's that?

57:46.416 --> 57:48.166
Knees. You, knees!

57:49.666 --> 57:51.500
Don't shoot. Don't shoot. I'm dying.

57:51.583 --> 57:52.583
What?

57:52.666 --> 57:54.916
Hey! Lady!

57:56.958 --> 57:58.166
I can see you!

58:02.708 --> 58:05.416
Oh. Are these your kids?

58:05.500 --> 58:06.791
[hushed] Fucking hate you.

58:06.875 --> 58:08.375
[Farful] Hi, Mom!

58:08.458 --> 58:10.166
[laughs]

58:10.250 --> 58:13.833
Listen, lady,
there's two ways that this can go.

58:13.916 --> 58:17.458
You can run off with that stash
or with your kids.

58:17.541 --> 58:20.708
Either way, I don't give a flying fuck
and a rolling doughnut.

58:22.541 --> 58:24.291
What's it gonna be?

58:25.583 --> 58:27.708
[gentle music playing]

58:29.666 --> 58:31.500
[Moke pants]

58:33.083 --> 58:34.708
Sorry, boys.

58:34.791 --> 58:36.333
[Farful] Wait.

58:37.125 --> 58:39.541
-What?!
-Shit!

58:39.625 --> 58:41.541
-[panting]
-[Farful shouts in distance]

58:41.625 --> 58:43.833
-Hey!
-[Moke] Kidding me?

58:45.708 --> 58:46.916
[Jady] Mom!

58:47.000 --> 58:49.208
What is happening, Mom?!

58:49.291 --> 58:50.958
Not part of the plan!

58:51.041 --> 58:52.916
[Farful] I have a gun!

58:53.000 --> 58:54.916
-[Moke] Mom!
-[gasping breaths]

58:55.000 --> 58:57.166
God, it doesn't seem like she's dying.

58:57.250 --> 58:58.666
[Jady] Fuck you!

59:00.125 --> 59:02.333
Mom, where are you going?

59:04.500 --> 59:05.875
[Farful] Hey!

59:07.166 --> 59:09.041
I'm gonna shoot!

59:09.125 --> 59:11.083
-No, no, no!
-[Farful] No!

59:14.916 --> 59:16.916
[tires screeching]

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
[Farful exclaims]

59:18.083 --> 59:21.291
The whole jewels-or-your-life thing
was just for effect.

59:21.375 --> 59:23.458
-I didn't think that she'd really...
-[panting]

59:25.500 --> 59:27.000
Really?

59:27.083 --> 59:30.208
[Jady] Come on, Farful.
Let's just talk this over, huh?

59:30.291 --> 59:32.291
I'm done making deals with you.

59:32.375 --> 59:34.041
I'm gonna tell everybody what you did.

59:34.125 --> 59:35.291
[babbles mockingly]

59:35.375 --> 59:36.666
Who they gonna listen to, huh?!

59:36.750 --> 59:38.333
They gonna believe you or me?

59:38.416 --> 59:41.583
I am a Farful.
Do you know what that means?

59:42.583 --> 59:45.791
I am justice!

59:45.875 --> 59:49.916
And I have a gun with your prints
on them at Dad's house.

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
That's a reset on your clock
right there, buddy.

59:54.083 --> 59:55.916
And as for
your fucking Sasquatch brother--

59:56.000 --> 59:57.666
-Yeah, fucking you.
-[tires screech]

59:57.750 --> 01:00:00.708
He assaulted a peace officer!

01:00:00.791 --> 01:00:02.541
Hope you didn't have plans, chief!

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.708
She'll be back.

01:00:08.791 --> 01:00:12.041
Yeah, if it's in 30 years,
she'll break her record.

01:00:12.125 --> 01:00:13.750
[scoffs]

01:00:13.833 --> 01:00:15.916
"Couldn't lose you."

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.750
All that time,
that's the best she could think up?

01:00:17.833 --> 01:00:19.083
It's what she said.

01:00:19.166 --> 01:00:21.625
Yeah, was that before
or after she said she was dying?

01:00:23.625 --> 01:00:26.625
-She is dying.
-Ran pretty fast for a dying woman.

01:00:26.708 --> 01:00:28.541
-Why would she lie?
-Why do you lie?

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:29.958
To get people to do shit.

01:00:30.041 --> 01:00:31.541
Hey, will you knock it off back there?!

01:00:31.625 --> 01:00:33.833
-I believe her.
-Of course you believe her.

01:00:33.916 --> 01:00:36.208
You always believe her
because Glenn believed her

01:00:36.291 --> 01:00:37.500
and that's who she sped off with.

01:00:37.583 --> 01:00:38.875
Glenn was cool as shit.

01:00:38.958 --> 01:00:41.458
You wanted to be like Glenn.
Congrats! You are now!

Don't make me come back there!

01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:54.708

-Sit still.

I'm gonna fix this.

I'm sorry. Is your brother okay?

01:02:32.708 --> 01:02:35.500
Not really. They were closer.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.208
No, I-I... I shouldn't have left.

01:02:40.291 --> 01:02:42.000
Yeah. I'm aware of that.

01:02:42.083 --> 01:02:44.750
But you did.
So we're gonna have to figure that out.

01:02:44.833 --> 01:02:46.666
I'll-I'll be back as soon as I can.

01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:48.916
You'll be back by dinner.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.250
Are we doing this together or not?

01:02:51.333 --> 01:02:53.583
-We are.
-Okay. Well, prove it.

01:02:53.666 --> 01:02:57.333
Because I'm not once telling our daughter
where you are instead of being her dad.

Come on, get in the car. Let's go.

01:03:14.541 --> 01:03:17.958
You think all these toasters are busted?
I've counted 22.

01:03:18.041 --> 01:03:20.916
They can't all be unusable, right?

01:03:22.708 --> 01:03:25.291
-I don't know.
-You know, Mom taught me this.

01:03:25.375 --> 01:03:27.500
Figure out what they want to hear,
and then say it.

01:03:27.583 --> 01:03:28.625
And then say it again.

01:03:28.708 --> 01:03:31.583
And you just keep saying it
until they swear it's the truth.

01:03:31.666 --> 01:03:33.500
And you skin 'em.

01:03:33.583 --> 01:03:34.750

You know, I really thought
this would fix everything. [chuckles]

You know, hit reset,
get us back to normal, but...

Man. [chuckles]

This is like when Wile E. Coyote, he draws
that tunnel on the side of the wall.

01:04:01.791 --> 01:04:03.791
You know he's gonna run into it.

01:04:03.875 --> 01:04:07.125
How does he not see that coming?

01:04:07.208 --> 01:04:08.583
He was hungry.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.958
You know, even though
she taught me how to lie,

01:04:16.041 --> 01:04:19.000
I thought Mom always
meant to tell the truth.

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.791
Yeah, she taught me how to run.

01:04:31.625 --> 01:04:33.791
Oh, right. It's about that time.

01:04:33.875 --> 01:04:37.208

has a cannon with your prints on it.

We got to get it back.

01:04:48.875 --> 01:04:50.250
You don't have to do that.

01:04:50.333 --> 01:04:52.666
Yeah, I don't have to do shit.

01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:54.416
I'm not leaving you.

01:04:57.125 --> 01:04:58.416
Come on.

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:01.000

-Whoo. [laughs]
-Ah. [laughs]

01:05:28.166 --> 01:05:30.333

01:05:34.208 --> 01:05:36.958
It was a no-win situation back there.

01:05:37.041 --> 01:05:40.958
The only shot we had
was to get the loot out.

01:05:41.041 --> 01:05:43.750
I mean, either one of you
would've done exactly the same thing

01:05:43.833 --> 01:05:45.708
and been absolutely right.

01:05:45.791 --> 01:05:49.166
-Just count out our cut.
-I did what I thought was best.

01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:51.208

to involve us, though, huh?
