00:17.183 --> 00:20.644
Leon St. James
for anaconda malt liquor.

00:20.812 --> 00:23.814
With the delectable combination
of the finest barleys and hops...

00:23.982 --> 00:25.441
It's the only malt liquor...

00:25.609 --> 00:28.652
That carries the seal of excellence
from uncle Sam himself.

00:30.697 --> 00:35.326
And when you pop the top,
the panties drop.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.996
Is that anaconda malt liquor?

00:39.164 --> 00:43.292
The only malt liquor to be approved
by the United States government?

00:43.460 --> 00:46.712
That's right. Anaconda malt liquor.

00:58.350 --> 01:02.019
Anaconda malt liquor,
brewed in piedmont, Georgia.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.885
Gentlemen, every one of you
are the most respected men...

01:37.138 --> 01:40.474
Doing business with me,
you'll find you'll be protected...

01:40.642 --> 01:44.895
And you will be supplied
with as much as you can distribute.

01:45.063 --> 01:50.359
However, one of us here
is not who he appears to be.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.573
Come on, you jive turkeys.

01:56.741 --> 01:59.118
What kind of rundown is this?

01:59.911 --> 02:01.537
Look, man...

02:01.705 --> 02:05.499
I gotta get back to the streets
where I come from, sucker.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.209
Hold it.

02:08.002 --> 02:12.423
I told you jive chumps,
I ain't no snitch.

02:12.590 --> 02:13.841
Who said you were?

02:33.945 --> 02:34.945
He's dead.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.909
My god, men.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.828
Do you know what this means?

02:43.455 --> 02:45.789
Do you know whose brother...?

02:46.624 --> 02:50.836
This ghetto is gonna be turned
upside-down, I tell you, upside-down.

02:51.004 --> 02:54.798
The streets are gonna run crimson
with the blood of the men...

02:54.966 --> 02:56.800
Responsible
for his brother's death.

02:56.968 --> 02:59.803
Man I am speaking of
is a veritable one-man army.

02:59.971 --> 03:02.848
And if you get on his bad side,
brother, you're done for.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.309
It's only a matter of time
before he finds out...

03:05.477 --> 03:07.728
And when he does,
no matter where he is...

03:07.896 --> 03:10.147
Get ready, gentlemen,
because hell's a-coming.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.691
Coming, coming, coming.

03:23.078 --> 03:26.997
Black dynamite,
that was the best loving I ever had.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.832
Me too.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.459
That goes triple for me.

03:31.002 --> 03:34.588
Mama, you're gonna waske up
the rest of the bitches.

03:34.756 --> 03:39.134
I wanna tell you a story
about a friend I've had.

03:39.302 --> 03:42.513
He's a mean motherfucker
and he's super bad.

03:42.680 --> 03:46.475
So grab on to your seats
and hang on tight...

03:46.643 --> 03:49.686
While I tell you a story
about black dynamite.

04:20.468 --> 04:21.510
Yeah?

04:21.678 --> 04:24.263
Dynamite, baby,
nipsy still ain't paid up.

04:24.430 --> 04:27.057
Solid. I'm on it, bee.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.235
Who's there?

04:38.403 --> 04:40.654
I'm looking for nipsy.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.908
There's no nipsy here.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.166
Now, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.834
Where's nipsy?

04:54.002 --> 04:55.586
Here I am, sucker.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.290
Honeybee,
what's happening, baby?

05:33.458 --> 05:36.835
Black dynamite.
What did you do to nipsy?

05:37.003 --> 05:40.088
Now, word on the street
is that he's gonna be in traction.

05:40.715 --> 05:43.675
You know me. I just talked to him.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.387
Thank you, black dynamite.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.097
I'm so happy.

05:49.557 --> 05:52.601
Hey, they mess with you, mama,
they're messing with me.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.687
Black dynamite, I wanna thank you
for taking care of us girls...

05:55.855 --> 05:58.315
While we was down and out
and didn't have no pimp.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.692
Oh, I almost forgot.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.403
Ain't nobody seen pimpin' Jake
for two days...

06:03.571 --> 06:05.989
And he ain't been by here
with your money.

06:06.157 --> 06:08.200
- And...
- I knew I forgot something.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.035
Tiny.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.287
Get pimpin' Jake out of my trunk.

06:12.455 --> 06:15.415
Tell him the rest by Wednesday
or I'll make him stick himself.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.167
I'm sorry. Go on, bee.

06:17.335 --> 06:21.171
They replaced the chain on your
nunchucks and oiled the bearings.

06:21.339 --> 06:25.133
They're sitting there on your desk,
next to the dry cleaning.

06:41.567 --> 06:44.861
All right. What's wrong, honeybee?

06:45.029 --> 06:46.863
I've known you too long.

06:47.031 --> 06:50.367
Now, if something's bothering you,
why don't you lay it on me?

06:50.535 --> 06:54.037
Black dynamite,
I got to go to the hospital.

06:54.205 --> 06:57.165
It's my little nephew, bucky.
He od'd.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.627
Where is bucky
and what has he had?

07:00.795 --> 07:02.879
It's that new drug on the street.

07:03.047 --> 07:05.882
All the kids are falling prey to it.

07:06.634 --> 07:09.511
What we gonna do,
black dynamite?

07:11.931 --> 07:13.890
I know what I'm gonna do.

07:14.058 --> 07:15.851
I'm gonna fight.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.894
The only way I know how.

07:18.062 --> 07:21.690
Ever since I was a boy,
all I knew was how to fight.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.483
Fight, fight, fight.

07:23.651 --> 07:27.738
And when I got tired,
I would fight some more.

07:27.905 --> 07:30.741
And now that the man
has got our backs to the wall...

07:30.908 --> 07:33.452
I ain't gonna let him hurt the kids.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.829
I'm gonna take him down.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.749
I'm gonna take them all down.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.892
Who the hell is interrupting
my kung fu?

08:42.730 --> 08:47.192
- Who the hell is this?
- Black dynamite, it's your aunt Billy.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.444
How many times
I told you not to call here...

08:49.612 --> 08:50.904
And interrupt my kung fu?

08:51.072 --> 08:53.490
It's bad news, dynamite.

08:53.658 --> 08:56.326
It's your only brother, Jimmy.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.829
He's dead, dynamite.

08:58.996 --> 09:00.997
Jimmy's dead.

09:03.084 --> 09:06.211
Scram.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.754
I said split.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.424
Shake the scene, you turkeys.
Get out of my house.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.592
I'll see you all tomorrow.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.345
How did it happen, aunt Billy?

09:15.513 --> 09:19.433
They found him shot full of holes
in an old shipping yard.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.101
Dead as a dog.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.562
Said he had drugs on him.

09:23.729 --> 09:26.565
I guess he was still on that stuff.

09:26.732 --> 09:30.026
Now, I thought you promised
your mama on her deathbed...

09:30.194 --> 09:33.905
You wass gonna get him
off that stuff, black dynamite.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.116
Whoever did this is gonna pay.

09:36.284 --> 09:37.784
I can promise you that.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.745
Well, I hope it ain't like
when you promised your mama...

09:40.913 --> 09:43.039
You wass gonna get him
off of that stuff...

09:43.207 --> 09:45.959
For the rest of his natural life...

09:54.218 --> 09:59.639
Black dynamite,
I want you to promise me...

09:59.807 --> 10:02.601
That you'll look after your brother...

10:02.768 --> 10:08.190
And make sure
he doesn't end up on drugs...

10:08.357 --> 10:10.317
Or dead.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.653
I promise.

10:16.115 --> 10:19.117
Jimmy, I am 18-year-old
black dynamite...

10:19.285 --> 10:21.578
And you are my 16... year-old
kid brother...

10:21.746 --> 10:24.498
And you are high
as a kite yet again.

10:25.082 --> 10:26.458
Who gave you the drugs, Jimmy?

10:26.626 --> 10:28.001
Who?

10:42.725 --> 10:45.101
Your mama would turn over
in her grave...

10:45.269 --> 10:47.771
If she were here to see this.

10:47.939 --> 10:51.107
She loved Jimmy with all her heart.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.819
You promised your mama
on her deathbed...

10:54.987 --> 10:57.113
That you would look after Jimmy.

10:57.281 --> 10:59.783
Now he's dead.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.668
I scoured the crime scene
like you told me to.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.670
Dig what I found.

11:15.925 --> 11:19.844
Now, this is some heavy shit.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.219
Freeze, turkeys.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.890
I see you haven't lost your touch,
b.D.

12:06.475 --> 12:08.101
O'Leary?

12:11.188 --> 12:14.858
The old "pie on the windowsill" trick.
I can't believe I fell for that.

12:15.234 --> 12:18.612
That was the same trap you used
in nam to save my ass.

12:19.530 --> 12:22.699
B.d. Took our fatigues
and put them on two dead gooks.

12:22.867 --> 12:25.160
I remember we circled back
and turned the tables.

12:25.328 --> 12:27.996
I guess you forgot about the time
you and bravo company...

12:28.164 --> 12:30.373
Left my black ass for dead, huh?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.667
But I remember.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.128
I remember everything.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.464
I remember Vietnam
like it was yesterday.

12:38.257 --> 12:42.552
I remember that village
in tainan that we cut down.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.513
It was a massacre.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.893
All the dead chinamen
we left in our tracks.

12:50.061 --> 12:53.897
I remember the faces, the children.

12:54.231 --> 12:56.983
This one child I'll never forget.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.861
Poor little bastard was still alive.

13:00.029 --> 13:03.031
His little Chinese legs
were blown clean off.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.949
Still see his little shins and feet...

13:05.117 --> 13:07.535
Hanging from the ceiling fan
across the hut.

13:07.703 --> 13:12.123
He was charred from his head down
to his little Chinese knees.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.210
He tried to get up...

13:15.544 --> 13:18.838
But he fell over when what wass left
of his right leg broke off.

13:20.257 --> 13:24.135
As he laid there flat on his face...

13:24.303 --> 13:26.471
He looked up at me.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.432
His little Chinese eyes
burned right into my stomach...

13:29.600 --> 13:31.768
Deep into my soul.

13:32.186 --> 13:35.730
He said something to me
in Chinese, like:

13:35.898 --> 13:37.357
Sounds like some cartoon shit...

13:37.525 --> 13:40.610
But I understood it to be a question
that he was asking me.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.987
And I don't have to know
how to speak Chinese...

13:43.155 --> 13:45.407
To know what that question was.

13:45.574 --> 13:48.118
"Why, black dynamite?

13:48.285 --> 13:49.869
Why?"

13:55.292 --> 13:57.168
We're a long way from nam.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.378
Look at this place.

13:58.546 --> 14:01.214
It must have an eight-track player
in every room.

14:01.382 --> 14:06.261
What's going on today
is a smack problem of epic proportion.

14:06.429 --> 14:10.014
Corruption is running rampant
and we don't know who to trust.

14:10.975 --> 14:14.477
We need you, black dynamite,
now more than ever.

14:14.645 --> 14:18.815
I know I was the best CIA agent
that the CIA ever had...

14:18.983 --> 14:21.317
But I thought I told you honkies
from the CIA...

14:21.485 --> 14:23.486
That black dynamite
was out of the game.

14:23.696 --> 14:27.741
- You're never out of the game.
- I've known you for a long time.

14:27.908 --> 14:30.160
And there's something
that you're not telling me.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.330
Okay.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.751
We heard about your brother's death.
The last thing we need...

14:37.918 --> 14:40.837
Is you running through the streets
creating a river of blood.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.381
Tell me who did it
and I'll just leave a puddle.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.300
We don't know who killed Jimmy.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.469
But I do know this.

14:47.762 --> 14:51.473
You step out of line, friendship or not,
and I'm gonna take you down.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.767
In case you forgot,
when you left the agency...

14:53.934 --> 14:55.810
You relinquished
your license to kill.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.854
Well, you do what you have to.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.356
Just don't get in my way.

15:38.270 --> 15:42.899
Come on, give it up
to afroditey and the moonchild.

15:43.067 --> 15:46.486
Give them a nice round of applause,
big round of applause, yeah.

15:46.987 --> 15:50.198
Black dynamite,
you came to see me.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.784
Bitch, no, I gotta go rap a taste
with my man horn...

15:52.952 --> 15:56.246
But afterwards since I'm here,
maybe I'll throw you one right quick.

15:57.248 --> 15:58.748
Out of sight.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.167
I get off in 15 minutes.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.670
You're right about that, sugar.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.255
You're right about that.

16:08.843 --> 16:12.262
Bullhorn, can I get you anything?

16:12.429 --> 16:15.682
Yes. I would like some of that ass.

16:17.268 --> 16:20.019
Yes, yes, yes.

16:23.232 --> 16:28.111
Man, who dare knock
when I'm planning to plant my...?

16:28.279 --> 16:31.239
Main man black dynamite.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.116
What it is, bullhorn?

16:33.284 --> 16:34.784
What you want to eat, man?

16:34.952 --> 16:38.496
Sister Betty made some hog maws
and, man, she put her ankle in it.

16:39.456 --> 16:42.292
I ain't here for no food, horn.

16:44.628 --> 16:46.129
Oh, man.

16:46.297 --> 16:48.089
I can dig it.

16:48.257 --> 16:51.593
Sugar, give us a minute.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.143
You know, man...

17:00.311 --> 17:03.313
I'm really sorry to hear
about what happened to Jimmy.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.483
You know, me and you
been tight for a long time.

17:07.651 --> 17:11.570
- So you know if you need anything...
- Thanks, horn.

17:11.989 --> 17:15.241
I need to know about the kind of cats
that Jimmy was running with.

17:15.409 --> 17:18.286
You know, he came around here
about a week ago...

17:18.454 --> 17:21.789
With some cats
that I had never seen before.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.790
Man, I mean,
these cats looked mean.

17:23.959 --> 17:27.252
Meaner than two fat motherfuckers
wrestling over pork chops and Greens.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.047
Can you dig it?

17:30.341 --> 17:33.468
Yeah. I can dig it.

17:37.681 --> 17:40.934
That little old half-a-player,
cream corn, was with them.

17:41.518 --> 17:43.019
You remember cream corn.

17:45.856 --> 17:50.026
So where is cream corn
these days?

17:50.194 --> 17:51.527
Yep, that's right.

17:51.695 --> 17:52.862
I'm running things.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.951
Cream corn.
That's why they call me that.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.285
Smooth.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.080
I got my measure for your pleasure.

18:02.247 --> 18:05.041
Stick with me, baby,
I'll have you farting through silk.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.668
And let a nigga mess with me.

18:06.835 --> 18:11.714
I'll jump on him,
all 93 pounds of pure dynamite...

19:06.437 --> 19:08.354
Let me catch my breath,
black dynamite.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.064
Shut up, sucker. I need answers.

19:10.232 --> 19:13.067
I wanna know who the cats were
that Jimmy was hanging with.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.361
Man, I don't know nothing
but nothing.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.613
Okay, all right, all right.

19:17.781 --> 19:20.283
Their leader's name
is Chicago wind.

19:20.451 --> 19:24.287
They hang out at a place
called the hip pocket on crenshaw.

19:24.455 --> 19:26.289
Now, get me up.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.723
So you must be black dynamite.

19:45.642 --> 19:48.978
Cream corn, you jive mother.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.320
Chicago wind, I presume.

19:57.488 --> 19:59.739
Your presumption is correct, nigga.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.992
If you presume that I killed
your brother then you presume wrong.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.911
Not that it means shit to me.

20:05.079 --> 20:08.456
Either way, shit.

20:08.624 --> 20:11.584
I wish I'd have killed
that nigga myself.

20:12.002 --> 20:13.753
Somebody else beat me to it.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.505
Is that so?

20:15.672 --> 20:18.007
Well, Mr. Chicago wind...

20:18.509 --> 20:20.802
What do you know about this?

20:24.723 --> 20:26.682
Some heavy shit.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.018
But dig.

20:30.270 --> 20:33.523
Let me explain something to you,
supernigga.

20:34.149 --> 20:35.525
I don't answer questions.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.610
I ask them.

20:38.862 --> 20:41.364
Even if I did know who killed
that brother of yours...

20:41.532 --> 20:44.367
What would make you think
I'm gonna tell you?

20:45.786 --> 20:49.330
Get your black ass out of my joint...

20:49.498 --> 20:51.707
Before we beat you
like a rented mule.

20:57.548 --> 20:59.132
That's right, you jive-ass punk.

20:59.341 --> 21:02.135
Don't be coming to the hip pocket
talking that shit, you dig?

21:02.302 --> 21:05.596
That's right, nigga.
Don't ever, ever come ba...

22:28.597 --> 22:31.307
Go catch Chicago wind
before he disappears.

22:31.475 --> 22:34.310
I'll take care
of this gorilla-eating goon here.

22:38.815 --> 22:43.236
Oh, you's a corn-fed fool
with a lot of muscle mass.

22:43.403 --> 22:48.491
But it's time for bullhorn
to get up in that ass.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.498
Motherfucker.

23:01.838 --> 23:05.174
Let everybody know
and suckers be warned...

23:05.342 --> 23:10.096
That this is the outcome
when you mess with bullhorn.

23:21.024 --> 23:22.858
Try to catch me now, sucker.

23:32.202 --> 23:33.869
Motherfucker.

23:40.294 --> 23:43.879
Now you know why they call me
Chicago wind, fool.

23:44.047 --> 23:48.092
Because I left your ass
blowing in the breeze.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.928
Man, don't you ever, ever...

24:01.356 --> 24:05.109
That black son of a bitch,
he killed my best dealer.

24:05.277 --> 24:11.490
I want black dynamite dead,
and I wasn't him dead now.

24:11.658 --> 24:14.493
Before you support
any of these candidates...

24:14.661 --> 24:17.997
Find out if they're going to rid
our communities...

24:18.165 --> 24:20.458
Of the hustlers and pushers.

24:20.625 --> 24:23.961
Or are they gonna destroy all
the programs that help our children...

24:24.129 --> 24:29.091
And give their corporate friends
free reign to exploit our community...

24:29.259 --> 24:30.509
Like congressman James.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.845
Watch me turn this shit around.

24:33.013 --> 24:34.597
Power to the people.

24:36.058 --> 24:39.018
With all due respect
to the young sister here...

24:39.603 --> 24:40.853
You all know me.

24:41.063 --> 24:42.104
Yes.

24:42.272 --> 24:43.856
Now, young lady...

24:44.024 --> 24:47.610
These fine folks
don't need to be misled.

24:47.778 --> 24:49.820
All they want is a little bit of bread.

24:51.531 --> 24:54.867
And you can't just stick it
to the man.

24:55.035 --> 24:57.328
You also
got to have yourself a plan.

24:58.580 --> 25:04.210
Now, we got to take this
from the jukebox to the ballot box.

25:04.669 --> 25:09.131
We got to go from the poor house
to the white house.

25:10.050 --> 25:12.051
Instead of maligning me...

25:12.219 --> 25:16.722
Let's take this land
from sea to shining sea.

25:17.432 --> 25:19.475
Keep the faith, brothers and sisters.

25:27.651 --> 25:30.403
Say, mama, you're gonna have
to work on your delivery...

25:30.570 --> 25:32.822
If you wanna take on
congressman James.

25:32.989 --> 25:36.325
The shame is, half these people
don't know what y'all talking about...

25:36.493 --> 25:39.120
But at least they can put his
to a beat.

25:39.704 --> 25:41.539
So, what do you do
to make a difference?

25:41.706 --> 25:44.375
Do you march? Do you vote?

25:44.543 --> 25:45.793
Oh, let me guess.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.586
You're one of Tom slick brothers...

25:47.754 --> 25:50.673
Think you can get by on good looks,
a wink and a smile, huh?

25:50.841 --> 25:52.842
I don't know about Tom slick.

25:53.009 --> 25:54.593
But thank you for the compliments.

25:55.512 --> 25:56.637
That's not what I meant.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.764
Not that I think
that you have good look...

25:58.932 --> 26:01.559
I mean, you know these guys
with their...

26:01.726 --> 26:04.854
- Winks and smiles.
- Yeah.

26:07.232 --> 26:08.691
What about the smile?

26:09.317 --> 26:11.360
I am smiling.

26:37.679 --> 26:39.763
Right on, right on.

26:47.397 --> 26:49.190
Excuse me, brothers.

26:49.357 --> 26:51.484
The militants turn, startled.

26:51.651 --> 26:52.693
This is private.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.570
How'd you get in here?

26:54.738 --> 26:56.238
I walked in.

26:56.406 --> 26:59.074
So you one of them
sneaky brothers, huh?

26:59.242 --> 27:01.327
Or maybe you an undercover pig.

27:01.495 --> 27:03.996
Or maybe you just a federal hit man.

27:04.164 --> 27:07.166
If I was,
you cats would already be dead.

27:07.584 --> 27:10.252
Now, let me speak
to the man in charge.

27:10.420 --> 27:13.088
Sarcastically, I'm in charge.

27:13.256 --> 27:14.757
Right on.

27:15.091 --> 27:16.842
If you were in charge...

27:17.010 --> 27:19.762
The people might as well surrender
to whitey right now...

27:19.930 --> 27:22.598
Because your survival skills
ain't worth a damn.

27:22.766 --> 27:24.892
Black dynamite.

27:26.228 --> 27:28.270
It has been a long time, my brother.

27:29.147 --> 27:30.606
What it is, saheed?

27:30.774 --> 27:33.317
You know this uncle Tom?

27:33.485 --> 27:35.110
Listen, sucker.

27:35.278 --> 27:37.821
I'm blacker than the ace of spades
and more militant...

27:37.989 --> 27:40.699
Than you and your whole damn army
put together.

27:40.867 --> 27:42.201
And while you're out there...

27:42.369 --> 27:44.787
Chanting at rallies
and browbeating politicians...

27:44.955 --> 27:47.498
I'm taking out any money
front sucker on a humble...

27:47.666 --> 27:48.749
That gets in my way.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.626
So I'll tell you what.

27:50.794 --> 27:54.088
When your so-called revolution starts,
you call me...

27:54.256 --> 27:57.007
And I'll be right down front
showing you how it's done...

27:57.175 --> 27:59.468
But until then,
you need to shut the fuck up...

27:59.636 --> 28:01.345
When grown folks is talking.

28:06.309 --> 28:07.977
I'm sorry.

28:09.479 --> 28:12.439
Yeah, we heard about
what went down at the hip pocket.

28:12.607 --> 28:14.650
That was righteous.

28:14.818 --> 28:16.860
That was personal, brother.

28:17.654 --> 28:21.365
Personal or not, you saved
a lot of brothers and sisters.

28:21.533 --> 28:25.035
You need our help, we're here.

28:25.579 --> 28:27.413
I can dig it.

28:29.165 --> 28:31.750
What can you tell me about this?

28:32.752 --> 28:34.253
Yeah.

28:37.173 --> 28:39.466
I ain't seen one of these in a while.

28:42.053 --> 28:44.513
I was gonna fuck him up.

28:59.154 --> 29:00.779
There it is.

29:01.281 --> 29:02.990
Ar-48.

29:03.158 --> 29:05.034
I wish we could get
some shit like this.

29:05.201 --> 29:08.829
That round will go through
a bulletproof vest like it was a pillow.

29:09.164 --> 29:11.373
Any idea who would have it?

29:11.541 --> 29:14.960
Whoever it is,
he must work for the man...

29:15.128 --> 29:18.922
Because that right there
is strictly government issue.

29:32.354 --> 29:34.313
You mind telling me
how this was found...

29:34.481 --> 29:36.649
At the scene
of my brother's death?

29:44.949 --> 29:46.950
Okay, black dynamite.

29:47.243 --> 29:49.119
Want me to level with you?

29:49.412 --> 29:51.914
Your brother Jimmy
wasn't a two-bit drug dealer.

29:52.082 --> 29:54.083
- He was one of us.
- What?

29:54.250 --> 29:56.418
He was working undercover.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.921
And he wanted to be just like you.

30:03.593 --> 30:07.096
Jimmy, why didn't you tell me?

30:10.600 --> 30:12.059
Vincent rafelli.

30:12.227 --> 30:14.645
Don of the carbozi family.

30:16.439 --> 30:18.273
Heads up a shipping company.

30:18.441 --> 30:20.818
We believe he's distributing dope.

30:20.985 --> 30:23.445
Jimmy felt that the Don
and congressman James...

30:23.613 --> 30:25.572
Had something up their sleeve.

30:25.740 --> 30:27.783
He didn't quite know what it was.

30:27.951 --> 30:29.952
He died trying to find out.

30:31.204 --> 30:34.081
So I don't need to tell you
the importance of this mission.

30:34.249 --> 30:36.166
But I just have one question.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.711
Are you in or are you out?

30:39.129 --> 30:42.172
Because god knows
you're the only one we can trust.

30:45.468 --> 30:47.052
I'm in.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.389
Good.

30:51.766 --> 30:54.143
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

30:54.894 --> 30:55.936
Hope you don't mind.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.647
I took the Liberty
of reinstating your license to kill.

31:03.486 --> 31:05.154
You're gonna need this.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.704
Black dynamite's looking for us.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.372
You said you would handle it.

31:16.416 --> 31:19.835
I'm bringing in
the heavy hitters now.

31:23.381 --> 31:27.009
Somebody broke into
my dead brother Jimmy's apartment.

32:21.898 --> 32:23.774
Breathe deeply, baby.

32:24.692 --> 32:26.610
Daddy, you make my heart beat.

32:27.070 --> 32:30.197
Yeah, Dr. Dynamite can hear that.

32:30.532 --> 32:32.407
But I think
you're running a temperature.

32:32.826 --> 32:37.037
Let me see if I can find
a thermometer for you.

32:38.540 --> 32:40.666
What the...?

32:41.251 --> 32:45.462
I told you urine sample,
nurse Jenny.

32:45.713 --> 32:47.589
Black dynamite.

32:47.757 --> 32:50.259
I mean, really.

32:50.426 --> 32:52.344
You sent her in here
with them titties.

32:52.512 --> 32:54.137
What did you expect?

32:54.305 --> 32:55.681
How's my X-ray?

32:55.849 --> 32:57.266
Well, no fragments.

32:57.433 --> 32:58.892
In and out.

32:59.060 --> 33:00.769
You're lucky, black dynamite.

33:00.937 --> 33:02.938
Three inches to the left...

33:03.106 --> 33:05.607
And we wouldn't even be having
this conversation.

33:05.775 --> 33:08.694
Three inches to the right,
it would've missed my black ass.

33:08.862 --> 33:11.446
Well, you need a new line of work.

33:11.614 --> 33:13.866
This is the second time this year.

33:14.784 --> 33:16.952
I know, I know.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.955
Why do I bother?
There's no helping you.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.958
No, doc, you help me just fine.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.293
See you next time.

33:29.090 --> 33:31.550
You hang in there, Leon.
You hear me?

33:42.604 --> 33:45.105
Hey, mama, what's going down?
That your kid in there?

33:45.273 --> 33:46.732
No.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.483
Nephew? Cousin?

33:48.651 --> 33:50.110
I said no.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.404
No relation, he...

33:52.572 --> 33:55.490
He happens to be one of the kids
at the orphanage where I work.

33:55.658 --> 33:58.201
He overdosed on smack.
Third one this month.

33:58.661 --> 34:00.996
And why?
What does it matter to you anyway?

34:01.164 --> 34:03.498
Whoa, mama, just trying to help.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.293
Oh, I don't need your kind of help.

34:06.461 --> 34:09.254
Men like you only help
when there's something in it for them.

34:09.422 --> 34:10.672
They can't be bothered.

34:10.840 --> 34:14.967
Too busy chasing their chicks
and their bread and their fancy car.

34:15.136 --> 34:16.344
No, Mr. Black dynamite.

34:16.512 --> 34:19.681
The only help you know
is how to help yourself.

34:20.099 --> 34:22.225
Whoa, mama, it ain't about me.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.018
It's about that kid in there.

34:24.353 --> 34:25.771
Now do you really want help...

34:25.980 --> 34:29.608
Or are you just trying to prove to the
world you can do it all on your own?

34:30.068 --> 34:31.275
Mama always said:

34:31.444 --> 34:34.237
"A helping hand is a helping hand,
clean or dirty."

34:34.405 --> 34:37.199
Guess my hands
ain't clean enough for you.

34:40.536 --> 34:41.578
Wait.

34:44.540 --> 34:46.248
These politicians don't give a damn.

34:46.417 --> 34:49.252
I mean, look, look at these ads.

34:50.672 --> 34:52.965
Congressman James
made promises to the people.

34:53.132 --> 34:55.342
Then he took away
his drug-awareness programs...

34:55.510 --> 34:58.387
And allowed his bedfellows
to sell crap to the kids.

34:58.554 --> 35:00.222
He even invested in these products.

35:00.390 --> 35:02.641
Now the dope is everywhere.
It's even...

35:02.809 --> 35:04.267
It's even in the orphanage.

35:05.561 --> 35:07.646
Not the orphanage.

35:09.232 --> 35:11.775
I used to be an orphan.

35:12.902 --> 35:15.153
You ain't got no mommy
and you ain't got no daddy.

35:15.321 --> 35:16.405
You're an orphan.

35:16.572 --> 35:20.617
Orphan, orphan, orphan.

35:24.205 --> 35:26.415
No, not the orphans.

35:29.585 --> 35:31.503
I think I need
to show you something.

35:33.423 --> 35:36.425
We've been trying
to reach these children.

35:36.592 --> 35:39.928
But this new smack on the street
is proving too much of a match for us.

35:41.097 --> 35:43.765
The worst thing
about these pushers...

35:43.933 --> 35:46.476
Getting these children
addicted to this new smack...

35:46.644 --> 35:50.731
Is that these children are orphans,
and orphans don't have parents.

35:51.941 --> 35:54.609
Ain't nothing in the world
get black dynamite more mad...

35:54.777 --> 35:57.362
Than some jive-ass sucker
dealing smack to the kids.

35:58.114 --> 35:59.698
Bobby, stop it.

35:59.866 --> 36:01.908
You'll kick soon.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.330
You dealing, brother?

36:07.498 --> 36:09.166
I need my smack, I need it now.

36:09.375 --> 36:13.462
Put a few of these honeys on the street
and I'll get you your bread, partner.

36:15.131 --> 36:17.424
I refuse to let this happen to you,
little man.

36:17.592 --> 36:20.469
I will shake this poisonous shit
out of your smacked-up body...

36:20.636 --> 36:21.678
If I have to.

36:21.846 --> 36:25.140
Black dynamite, stop.
We've tried that, nothing works.

36:27.393 --> 36:30.062
I can't look at these kids no more.

36:33.024 --> 36:36.068
This orphanage used to be alive
with laughter, kids playing.

36:36.235 --> 36:37.694
Now look at it, it's sickening.

36:37.862 --> 36:40.864
Whoever's responsible is gonna pay,
if it's the last thing I do.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.949
Black dynamite,
I wish it was that simple.

36:43.117 --> 36:45.160
But this is much bigger
than you and me.

36:45.328 --> 36:46.328
Hey, little mama.

36:46.496 --> 36:49.164
It may be bigger than you
and it may be bigger than me.

36:49.332 --> 36:51.792
But it ain't bigger than you and me.
Can you dig it?

36:51.959 --> 36:53.168
I think so.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.337
I gotta split.

36:55.505 --> 36:57.255
You need me to drop you off
somewhere?

36:57.423 --> 37:00.050
No, I think I'm gonna go down
the street and grab a bite.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.843
I'll drive you.

37:11.145 --> 37:13.021
Thanks for the ride.

37:28.621 --> 37:30.789
Can I get some hot sauce
for my donut?

37:30.957 --> 37:32.040
Excuse me, lady.

37:39.465 --> 37:41.800
- Oh, my god.
- What is it? What is going on?

37:41.968 --> 37:43.802
How did you know?

37:43.970 --> 37:47.722
Donuts don't wear alligator shoes.

38:11.581 --> 38:13.206
Damn.

38:28.431 --> 38:29.472
Sorry, Roscoe.

38:30.016 --> 38:31.433
It's cool, man.

38:31.601 --> 38:34.769
Chili and donuts ain't working out
for me no how.

38:34.937 --> 38:36.646
Maybe it's time for a change.

38:38.858 --> 38:40.442
What have you gotten me into?

38:40.610 --> 38:42.319
It wasn't me they were after, sugar.

38:42.486 --> 38:45.947
You must have pissed off some people
in some pretty high places.

38:46.782 --> 38:49.534
I'm gonna take you somewhere
you'll be safe.

38:50.745 --> 38:53.205
Black dynamite,
you ain't got to worry about Gloria.

38:53.372 --> 38:55.457
She gonna be safe up in here.

38:55.625 --> 38:58.627
I been keeping the girls up
on their kung fu like you told me to.

38:58.794 --> 39:03.632
Now, they find her up in here,
we will fricassee they honky asses.

39:05.218 --> 39:07.677
You sure about this?
Maybe we should call the police.

39:07.845 --> 39:10.889
No, mama. You can bet
your sweet ass and half a titty...

39:11.057 --> 39:14.726
Whoever put that hit on you, already
got the cops in their back pocket.

39:15.436 --> 39:16.770
You be cool, mama.

39:16.938 --> 39:19.147
Bee here will keep you tight
and out of sight.

39:19.315 --> 39:22.984
I'm gonna shake the tree
from the roots and rake up the fruits...

39:23.486 --> 39:26.780
Rip it up out the ground,
find out what's going down.

39:26.948 --> 39:29.574
Don't worry about tomorrow, mama,
because tonight...

39:29.742 --> 39:32.494
Dynamite's gonna make
everything all right.

39:32.662 --> 39:34.412
Euphoria, shut up.
I know that was you.

39:34.580 --> 39:35.664
I ain't even gotta look.

39:35.831 --> 39:38.833
I should send you to crenshaw Pete
with his hot-ass coat hangers.

39:39.001 --> 39:40.418
Would you like that?

39:52.723 --> 39:54.808
Black dynamite,
I know that we just met...

39:54.976 --> 39:57.352
But somehow I feel
that I can trust you.

39:58.521 --> 40:00.772
I'll be here waiting
till you come to get me.

40:03.567 --> 40:05.610
Thank you for saving my life.

40:06.779 --> 40:08.405
You be cool, little mama.

40:08.572 --> 40:11.032
I'll be back before too long.

40:26.007 --> 40:28.925
Order, order, order.

40:29.719 --> 40:30.760
Order, nigga.

40:33.556 --> 40:36.683
The game is at an all-time low.

40:38.060 --> 40:42.063
Never in the history of the game
has there been such devastation.

40:42.231 --> 40:43.273
- That's right.
- Yeah.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.943
Tricks running low,
cops pushing harder than ever.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.153
- Yeah.
- That's right.

40:48.321 --> 40:50.155
These little bitches just running wild.

40:50.323 --> 40:53.742
I thought we had
these poop-butt pigs paid off.

40:53.909 --> 40:55.118
- Come to find out.
- Yeah.

40:55.286 --> 40:57.829
They trapping my ho's
every time they hit the track.

40:58.581 --> 41:02.334
I'm spending more bail money
than I'm getting tail money.

41:02.501 --> 41:04.919
Yeah, yeah.
I can dig it, chocolate, I can dig it.

41:05.087 --> 41:07.797
Come on, this has been
my worst physical year ever.

41:07.965 --> 41:09.507
Fiscal, nigga. With a f. Fiscal.

41:09.675 --> 41:13.553
Well, it's been the worst one ever.
I can't even afford to get my hair fixed.

41:13.721 --> 41:15.430
Sounds like you're assed out.

41:15.598 --> 41:16.890
You know what they say.

41:17.058 --> 41:18.767
The bitch won't sell her ass.

41:18.934 --> 41:21.269
- A pimp will.
- Will.

41:21.437 --> 41:22.604
Shut up, tasty.

41:24.648 --> 41:26.232
I turned you onto the game...

41:26.400 --> 41:28.777
When you nothing
but a little jailhouse tramp.

41:31.155 --> 41:32.947
Now, listen up.

41:34.200 --> 41:38.661
Pimping has been around
since the world started turning.

41:38.829 --> 41:42.791
And it's going to keep right on
turning right along with it...

41:43.125 --> 41:47.629
Until this little planet
rotates off its axis...

41:47.797 --> 41:54.052
As a result of its core overheating
and explodes into cosmic dust.

41:54.220 --> 41:55.387
Damn.

41:55.554 --> 41:57.514
- Can you dig it?
- It's done, brother.

41:57.681 --> 41:59.140
You know what I'm saying?

41:59.517 --> 42:01.810
Now look here.
These times, they come and they go.

42:01.977 --> 42:04.354
- Right.
- And if you live long enough...

42:04.522 --> 42:07.107
You'll be around
to see them come again.

42:07.525 --> 42:13.154
But what we need to do
is we need to collectivize.

42:13.322 --> 42:15.156
- Yeah.
- Right on, right on.

42:15.324 --> 42:16.950
Now, look here.

42:17.618 --> 42:19.119
Listen.

42:19.286 --> 42:22.580
Stop all the bullshit and take a vote.

42:23.833 --> 42:25.667
Yes, o.

42:27.002 --> 42:28.837
All in favor, raise your hand.

42:29.463 --> 42:31.172
Kotex?

42:31.507 --> 42:34.467
- Mo bitches?
- I can dig it, baby.

42:34.635 --> 42:35.969
Chocolate giddy-up?

42:36.137 --> 42:38.513
Chocolate giddy-up.

42:38.681 --> 42:40.181
Crenshaw Pete?

42:41.350 --> 42:43.017
Captain kangaroo pimp?

42:45.396 --> 42:47.730
- Willie?
- I'm with you.

42:47.898 --> 42:51.526
Nigga, even if they don't
knock the broads...

42:52.236 --> 42:56.322
There ain't enough tricks
to go around.

42:58.033 --> 42:59.617
Now, look here.

42:59.952 --> 43:02.162
I don't know about the rest of y'all.

43:02.621 --> 43:04.873
But it looks like I have
to keep selling heroin...

43:05.040 --> 43:06.249
Just to make ends meet.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.543
Then you'll have
a much bigger problem.

43:08.711 --> 43:10.253
Black dynamite.

43:10.421 --> 43:12.172
What's happening, baby?

43:12.339 --> 43:13.506
What it is, big o?

43:13.674 --> 43:17.051
To what do we owe this pleasure?

43:17.219 --> 43:20.221
I just got one thing to lay on you cats
and then I'll split.

43:20.389 --> 43:22.056
That I'm declaring war...

43:22.224 --> 43:25.059
On anybody who sells drugs
in our community.

43:25.227 --> 43:29.481
But, black dynamite,
I sell drugs to the community.

43:29.648 --> 43:32.942
Well, be that as it may,
if I catch you...

43:33.110 --> 43:35.236
I will not consider you
a brother or friend.

43:35.404 --> 43:36.905
Now, can you dig it?

43:37.072 --> 43:39.282
Hell no, nigga.

43:40.242 --> 43:42.452
I can't dig it.

43:42.912 --> 43:45.497
- Now who you supposed to be?
- That's black dynamite.

43:45.664 --> 43:47.582
I ain't ask you, nigga. Shut up.

43:47.750 --> 43:50.084
I'm gonna tell you like this.

43:50.252 --> 43:53.922
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do.

43:54.840 --> 43:57.926
- Yeah.
- Well, the choice is yours, brother.

43:58.093 --> 44:00.053
But if me and my people
catch you...

44:00.221 --> 44:02.889
You're gonna have
a lot more to deal with.

44:03.057 --> 44:05.475
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Goodbye, black dynamite.

44:05.643 --> 44:08.353
Will you stop that?

44:15.194 --> 44:16.319
Hold it right there.

44:17.530 --> 44:18.696
It's me, black dynamite.

44:18.864 --> 44:21.449
- What the hell do you wasn't?
- I wanna help you.

44:21.617 --> 44:22.784
Why should I trust you...

44:22.952 --> 44:25.203
After you dropped dime on me
to Chicago wind?

44:25.829 --> 44:28.414
Because your brother Jimmy
saved my life.

44:28.582 --> 44:31.125
I was supposed to be with him
the night he got killed.

44:31.752 --> 44:34.837
But he called me
and told me to stay at home.

44:35.005 --> 44:36.548
I guess I owe him one.

44:40.302 --> 44:42.929
I'll need a list
of names and locations.

44:43.097 --> 44:44.138
Ain't no thing.

44:44.515 --> 44:47.100
Man, everything is gonna be okay.

44:47.268 --> 44:48.643
Bullhorn...

44:48.811 --> 44:52.480
Cream corn here says he can
help us find the cats we're looking for.

44:52.648 --> 44:54.399
Now, what do you think?

44:54.567 --> 44:57.986
Man,
I think we should put our ankles in it.

46:17.733 --> 46:20.068
They broke into my home.

46:20.235 --> 46:22.737
They got the ledger.

46:22.905 --> 46:24.906
They got the manifest,
they got everything.

46:25.074 --> 46:27.033
Everything.
Names, dates, schedules.

46:27.201 --> 46:28.660
We even got the shipping routes.

46:28.827 --> 46:30.536
They won't be able to take a shit...

46:30.704 --> 46:32.580
Without us knowing
when or what color.

46:32.748 --> 46:35.416
We cleaned up the streets
and gave them back to the people.

46:35.584 --> 46:39.629
Once again, making them a pleasant
place to take an afternoon stroll.

46:44.301 --> 46:46.761
Extra, extra. Hot off the presses.

46:46.929 --> 46:49.430
Black dynamite
cleans up the street.

46:50.724 --> 46:52.934
It's unbelievable, black dynamite.

46:53.102 --> 46:55.103
Everyone looks so happy...

46:55.270 --> 46:56.854
And it's all thanks to you.

46:57.022 --> 46:59.190
I'd like to take the credit
but dig, mama.

46:59.358 --> 47:02.443
There's no I in "revolut..." In "team."

47:03.153 --> 47:05.947
Look, I'm know I'm gonna be rusty,
but I have to try.

47:07.616 --> 47:09.701
Hi, girls. What is your name?

47:09.868 --> 47:11.953
I'm shawanda,
and her name's brikwilla.

47:12.121 --> 47:13.329
Those are beautiful names.

47:13.497 --> 47:16.290
I'm Gloria
and this is black dynamite.

47:16.458 --> 47:19.293
My mama said
my daddy's name is black dynamite.

47:20.045 --> 47:21.629
So did my mama.

47:22.965 --> 47:24.882
Hush up, little girls.

47:25.050 --> 47:27.343
A lot of cats have that name.

48:09.762 --> 48:13.639
Well, that was amazing.

48:13.849 --> 48:16.684
Thank you
for a beautiful day and night.

48:18.687 --> 48:23.691
But I think I should be going.

48:23.859 --> 48:26.944
I think you'll be safer
if you stay here tonight.

48:27.988 --> 48:29.906
Oh, you do, do you?

48:30.324 --> 48:33.034
I hope you don't think you're
gonna get any of this cookie.

48:33.202 --> 48:35.369
Because if I offered you
some of this cookie...

48:35.537 --> 48:37.038
This cookie might kill you.

48:37.372 --> 48:39.957
Don't think because
we've been frolicking in the park...

48:40.125 --> 48:42.001
You got this closed
because it takes...

48:42.169 --> 48:43.544
Yeah, yeah, mama.

48:44.713 --> 48:47.924
You can hit the sheets or the streets.
It don't make me no never mind.

48:48.091 --> 48:50.384
That's your bag, baby.
You can go or you can come.

48:50.552 --> 48:51.844
Can you dig it?

50:06.128 --> 50:07.128
Yeah.

50:07.296 --> 50:08.337
Black dynamite.

50:08.505 --> 50:10.423
We read the ledger
and it just don't stop.

50:10.591 --> 50:14.594
There's a trail of paper
that leads all the way to the top.

50:14.761 --> 50:16.387
A big shipment is coming to town...

50:16.555 --> 50:19.181
And it's right there
where that cracker wrote it down.

50:19.349 --> 50:21.934
Now, we don't know the whens,
but we do know the wheres.

50:22.102 --> 50:25.813
And however the fuck the what's,
we'll sure enough be there.

50:29.443 --> 50:31.694
Looks like he's got two warehouses.

50:31.862 --> 50:35.197
One big one,
and one smaller one here.

50:35.365 --> 50:38.993
We break into the two units,
we hit the smaller one first...

50:39.161 --> 50:41.621
Then we scale the fence,
enter from the south...

50:41.788 --> 50:45.166
Use an acetylene blowtorch to
breech the warehouse from the back.

50:45.334 --> 50:47.168
That way we avoid the guards.

50:47.336 --> 50:50.713
Man, them honkies gonna be running
for cover when us brothers get...

50:51.214 --> 50:53.299
Get... get...

50:57.930 --> 50:58.971
The torch is an issue.

50:59.139 --> 51:01.515
We won't be able to get
an acetylene torch in time.

51:01.683 --> 51:03.476
Think again, brother.

51:03.644 --> 51:05.853
You know somebody that's got one?

51:06.355 --> 51:08.481
I know just the cat.

52:06.581 --> 52:08.916
All right, snowflake.
Where's the dope?

52:09.084 --> 52:11.127
Up yours, coon.

52:12.921 --> 52:15.464
It's right over there
in the body bags, jeez.

52:22.014 --> 52:24.015
So how much dope
is in the big warehouse?

52:25.267 --> 52:30.021
They're gonna kill me anyway.
I'm not gonna tell you nothing, coon.

52:31.773 --> 52:34.942
Dynamite, I got something
that will make him talk.

52:39.781 --> 52:42.908
I ain't gonna tell you nothing.

52:43.535 --> 52:46.620
Operation code Kansas.
Can't stop it, too late.

52:46.788 --> 52:50.166
Operation code Kansas
gonna fix all the niggas.

52:53.045 --> 52:56.630
Yeah, you won't be so big
and so bad anymore...

52:56.798 --> 53:00.009
Because Kansas gonna fix you.

53:00.802 --> 53:02.678
Just the niggas.

53:02.846 --> 53:05.389
Just the nig...

53:10.479 --> 53:11.979
Damn, smoke.

53:12.147 --> 53:14.190
I think you gave him
too much of that shit.

53:15.025 --> 53:17.234
How long till it wears off?

53:30.832 --> 53:31.916
It's malt liquor?

53:32.834 --> 53:36.003
It's that new anaconda malt liquor
from the billboards.

53:36.171 --> 53:38.214
It's supposed to give you:

53:44.012 --> 53:45.179
Tastes good too.

53:45.347 --> 53:46.972
I know the drugs
are here somewhere.

53:47.140 --> 53:50.142
We're gonna check every crate
until we find it.

53:55.857 --> 53:57.483
I can't believe it, fellas.

53:57.651 --> 54:00.820
That entire shipment
was just malt liquor.

54:00.987 --> 54:02.530
Don't beat yourself up, dynamite.

54:02.697 --> 54:05.491
We still kept the 50 keys
we found in that first warehouse...

54:05.659 --> 54:07.159
From getting on the streets.

54:07.619 --> 54:09.912
I'm gonna go home
and drink the rest of this, man.

54:10.080 --> 54:13.207
Y'all should've grabbed some
of this shit. This shit is incredible.

54:18.130 --> 54:20.714
I tell you, brothers,
it just don't make no damn sense.

54:20.882 --> 54:23.717
The manifest, the shipping log,
the ledgers.

54:23.885 --> 54:26.720
All records are consistent
with that damned beer shipment.

54:26.888 --> 54:30.224
If anything else was in there,
it would have to weigh something.

54:30.392 --> 54:32.643
They got it out before we got there.

54:32.811 --> 54:33.894
No.

54:34.062 --> 54:37.064
Why would they have guards there
if they got the drugs out?

54:37.232 --> 54:39.400
No, them crackers
was protecting something.

54:39.568 --> 54:43.154
B.d., we checked every single crate,
every stinking bottle.

54:43.321 --> 54:45.239
Man, I'm with you, dynamite.

54:45.407 --> 54:47.575
That babbling cracker
knew something.

54:47.742 --> 54:51.036
What that guard said,
I keep running through my head.

54:51.329 --> 54:53.205
Code Kansas.

54:53.373 --> 54:55.791
"You people
won't be so big anymore."

54:55.959 --> 54:57.751
Code Kansas.

54:57.919 --> 54:59.753
It just don't make no damn sense.

54:59.921 --> 55:01.255
Hey, sweet thing.

55:01.423 --> 55:04.425
What don't make no sense is
the service around this motherfucker.

55:04.593 --> 55:06.093
Bitch, do you see us?

55:07.345 --> 55:09.638
I'd like two sausage links,
two sausage patties...

55:09.806 --> 55:12.349
Two hot dogs,
split down the middle twice, okay?

55:12.517 --> 55:14.059
Baloney, fry that up into a dome.

55:14.227 --> 55:16.937
Slice that,
take a spatula, smush fry it.

55:17.105 --> 55:18.439
And one waffle, please.

55:18.607 --> 55:19.940
I can get your waffle...

55:20.108 --> 55:22.359
But all we got
is the chicken from last night.

55:22.527 --> 55:25.321
Now, I can bring you some of that
if you wasn't some meat.

55:26.448 --> 55:28.157
Chicken and waffles?

55:28.325 --> 55:29.825
That's it.

55:31.620 --> 55:34.455
Take it easy, brother.
It ain't her fault.

55:34.664 --> 55:36.665
Sorry, sister,
we all just a little uptight.

55:36.833 --> 55:39.251
But if you bring us
some of them good-ass waffles...

55:39.419 --> 55:41.462
Everything will be all right.

55:42.505 --> 55:44.965
Man, you guys
ain't had no waffles like these.

55:45.133 --> 55:47.134
These waffles are so good...

55:47.302 --> 55:49.386
They're like they come
from down south.

55:49.554 --> 55:51.972
These buttery motherfuckers
will melt in your mouth.

55:52.140 --> 55:54.975
- Man, you ain't had no waffles...
- Wait.

55:56.061 --> 55:58.604
Bullhorn, what did you just say?

55:59.147 --> 56:00.940
You said:

56:01.107 --> 56:03.859
"Melts in your mouth."

56:05.612 --> 56:07.112
Quick.

56:07.489 --> 56:09.657
What else melts in your mouth?

56:09.824 --> 56:12.701
- M&M's.
- Exactly.

56:12.869 --> 56:15.496
And not in your hands.

56:16.498 --> 56:18.791
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

56:19.251 --> 56:20.334
And who makes M&M's?

56:21.002 --> 56:22.711
Mars candy company makes it.

56:22.879 --> 56:24.255
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's right.

56:24.422 --> 56:27.174
And Mars is also...

56:27.342 --> 56:31.178
- The Roman god of war.
- That's what I'm telling you.

56:31.346 --> 56:33.973
Who is the Greek god of war?

56:34.140 --> 56:35.766
- Ares.
- Right on.

56:35.934 --> 56:40.896
Now, you take Mars
and spell it backwards, drop the s.

56:41.064 --> 56:42.815
- What is it? What did you get?
- R...

56:42.983 --> 56:44.358
Ram. That's right.

56:44.526 --> 56:48.862
And ram is the zodialogical sign
for aries.

56:49.447 --> 56:50.531
- Now dig.
- That right.

56:50.699 --> 56:54.368
- Ares's half sister is Athena.
- Now you're getting it.

56:54.536 --> 56:57.288
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Athena, Athens.

56:57.455 --> 57:00.374
Which is the capital of Greece.

57:00.542 --> 57:01.834
And as we all know...

57:02.002 --> 57:05.296
Zodialogical astronomy
was created by the Greeks in...

57:05.463 --> 57:07.840
785 b.C.

57:08.008 --> 57:11.552
And 785 is the area code of Topeka.
Oh, my god.

57:11.720 --> 57:15.806
785 is the area code
to Topeka, Kansas.

57:15.974 --> 57:18.058
Code Kansas.

57:18.226 --> 57:21.812
Now you take that,
spell it backwards and drop the s.

57:22.105 --> 57:24.898
Snake doc. Snake doctor, yeah.

57:25.275 --> 57:26.525
- Yes.
- Yeah.

57:26.693 --> 57:27.776
And brothers...

57:27.944 --> 57:30.988
Who is the Greek demigod
of medicine...

57:31.156 --> 57:34.616
Who believed that snakes' tongues
had mystical healing powers?

57:34.784 --> 57:36.785
Aesculapius, of course.

57:36.953 --> 57:40.998
He had a staff with snakes
intertwining all around that bitch.

57:41.166 --> 57:43.167
They called it aesculapius's staff.

57:43.335 --> 57:46.045
It's a symbol the medical field uses
to this day.

57:46.212 --> 57:47.254
I've seen it.

57:47.422 --> 57:51.133
Now,
what legend involving snakes...

57:51.301 --> 57:54.345
Is in both Greek and Roman
mythology?

57:54.512 --> 57:57.890
Now, come on.
It involves aesculapius's own father.

57:58.058 --> 57:59.475
Apollo.

58:00.685 --> 58:01.977
Yeah. Thanks, lady.

58:02.145 --> 58:03.187
That's right.

58:03.355 --> 58:09.693
Apollo slew the serpent at delphi
which was a big-ass snake.

58:09.861 --> 58:10.903
That's right.

58:11.071 --> 58:14.281
And what, brothers,
is the biggest snake in the world?

58:14.449 --> 58:17.284
The south American anaconda.

58:17.452 --> 58:21.789
- What she said.
- Anaconda malt liquor.

58:21.956 --> 58:25.626
And what is the slogan
for anaconda malt liquor?

58:25.794 --> 58:27.544
"Anaconda malt liquor gives you..."

58:28.630 --> 58:29.671
Gives you what?

58:30.840 --> 58:32.883
And who else is famous for:

58:33.426 --> 58:34.635
Little Richard.

58:34.803 --> 58:36.345
- Who?
- Little Richard.

58:36.513 --> 58:39.431
So, what they're really saying is...

58:39.599 --> 58:43.811
Anaconda malt liquor
gives you little Richard.

58:45.438 --> 58:48.273
What is another word for Richard?

58:51.486 --> 58:54.113
- Gunsmoke. Come on, get up.
- Gunsmoke!

58:58.159 --> 58:59.243
Damn.

58:59.411 --> 59:03.330
Anaconda malt liquor
gives you a little dick.

59:10.088 --> 59:11.964
Should we kill him?

59:14.134 --> 59:16.093
Man, do you wasn't to live?

59:17.512 --> 59:19.680
I said, do you want to go on?

59:29.232 --> 59:33.527
Man, this time these crackers
have gone too far.

59:35.029 --> 59:37.364
- The warehouse.
- The warehouse.

59:40.869 --> 59:43.036
Freeze, you jive-time suckers.

59:43.746 --> 59:45.706
Who's in charge?

59:46.833 --> 59:49.751
Brothers, make these honkies load
this dick-shrinking poison...

59:49.919 --> 59:52.963
Back into the warehouse
so we can burn this mother down.

59:53.131 --> 59:55.048
Waste them if they make a sound.

59:55.216 --> 59:57.843
I'm gonna go inside and find out
who's running this shit.

59:58.011 --> 01:00:02.055
- All right, men, move it.
- Come on, you heard him.

01:00:02.223 --> 01:00:03.932
Sucker, you drop it right there.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.143
- O'Leary?
- That's right.

01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:08.604
Go ahead, guys, I got this.

01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:13.442
O'Leary, you son of a bitch.
I should have known it was you.

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:14.651
You should have.

01:00:14.819 --> 01:00:17.529
You were too busy
and trying to lay that orphan mama...

01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:19.740
To not see
what was in front of your face.

01:00:19.908 --> 01:00:22.743
You diabolical
dick-shrinking motherfuckers.

01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:24.453
You were the leak all the time.

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:26.663
And I bet you were behind
Jimmy's death.

01:00:26.831 --> 01:00:28.582
Hey, man,
I was just following orders.

01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:31.460
That's what a good soldier does,
follow orders, unlike you.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:33.921
Everything's gotta be done
the black dynamite way.

01:00:34.088 --> 01:00:35.255
I gave the order on Jimmy.

01:00:35.423 --> 01:00:37.424
I gave it to James,
who gave it to the Don.

01:00:37.592 --> 01:00:39.760
What good's it gonna do you now?

01:00:49.103 --> 01:00:52.272
The old birthday-candle trick
from nam.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:55.025
Just when you think it's out...

01:00:57.111 --> 01:01:00.614
O'Leary. O'Leary, where are you?

01:01:00.782 --> 01:01:02.533
Yeah, who's this?

01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:33.772
Fellas, we going on a boat ride
to kung fu island.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.823
Hey, black dynamite,
there's the island.

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:55.210
Okay.

01:01:55.753 --> 01:01:57.838
Now, here's the plan.

01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:04.678
Yeah.

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:07.556
Okay, let's split up.

01:02:28.536 --> 01:02:30.829
He's here.

01:02:34.709 --> 01:02:35.876
We kicked their ass.

01:02:36.044 --> 01:02:38.211
Power to the people, brothers.

01:02:39.213 --> 01:02:40.714
This is it, brothers.

01:02:40.882 --> 01:02:44.551
- This is where we stick it to the man.
- Yeah.

01:02:44.719 --> 01:02:46.136
Now, let's go get that lab.

01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:49.723
All right, let's go.

01:02:51.809 --> 01:02:56.021
You know, when we get back home,
I'm gonna retire from the revolution.

01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:57.481
Start a family.

01:02:57.649 --> 01:02:59.066
Show this picture.

01:02:59.233 --> 01:03:00.400
That's Betty Jo.

01:03:00.568 --> 01:03:02.694
Yeah, right on, yeah.

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:05.739
Buy a home in the country.
Raise our own fruits and vegetables.

01:03:05.907 --> 01:03:07.616
Bake our own bread,
know what I mean?

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:09.117
Bake our own...

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:14.414
Who saw that coming...?
Who saw where that came from?

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:17.042
Let's go.

01:03:45.905 --> 01:03:49.116
I should've known you would be
behind this, fiendish Dr. Wu.

01:03:49.867 --> 01:03:53.286
Your knowledge of scientific
biological transmogrifications...

01:03:53.454 --> 01:03:56.790
Is only out-matched by your zest
for kung-fu treachery.

01:03:57.959 --> 01:04:04.464
Your kung fu is quite extraordinary,
black dynamite.

01:04:04.882 --> 01:04:06.133
But no match for mine.

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:10.679
You should have joined us
when you had the chance.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:13.473
But now you must die.

01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:16.727
Man, I'll take this jive-ass Turkey.

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:23.650
Bullhorn, no.

01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:27.904
At long last, our friendship bonded
by the struggle against the man...

01:04:28.072 --> 01:04:31.450
Has been brought to an end
by kung-fu treachery.

01:04:31.617 --> 01:04:35.620
Brother, your death
will not go unavenged.

01:04:35.788 --> 01:04:40.000
Fiendish Dr. Wu,
you done fucked up now.

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:42.919
Get him.

01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:05.025
You must try the wu family
red silk kung fu.

01:05:15.411 --> 01:05:17.537
Black dynamite panther fist.

01:06:18.599 --> 01:06:20.767
What the fuck, huh?

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:22.602
Keep your eye on black dynamite.

01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:33.989
Looking for me?

01:06:38.452 --> 01:06:43.123
Can you see where I'm coming from,
you jive motherfucker?

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:48.295
No rush, huh? Come on, huh?

01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:52.132
You told him
to keep an eye out for me.

01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:05.395
I threw that shit
before I walked in the room.

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:15.864
I wanna know
who's pulling your strings.

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:18.325
Now start talking. Talk.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.495
- I said, start talking.
- Okay.

01:07:22.663 --> 01:07:24.789
Your government
has been preoccupied...

01:07:24.957 --> 01:07:27.208
With building the bigger penis
for years.

01:07:31.672 --> 01:07:32.923
What's this green one?

01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:35.759
It did exactly opposite
of what it was intended.

01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:41.264
It made the penis shrivel to the size
of a 2-month-old snapping turtle.

01:07:41.432 --> 01:07:43.850
This is what you've been putting
in the malt liquor?

01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:46.269
I was under orders.

01:07:46.979 --> 01:07:48.605
They threatened to fire me.

01:07:49.357 --> 01:07:51.274
Speaking of fire.

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:56.112
Suddenly,
I'd like to leave your island.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:58.198
No! No!

01:07:58.366 --> 01:07:59.741
No.

01:08:10.711 --> 01:08:12.379
You dirty motherfucker.

01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:20.553
Hey, black dynamite,
I found a helicopter.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.221
Quick, give me a hairpin.

01:08:35.694 --> 01:08:37.569
What's in the briefcase,
black dynamite?

01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:39.113
How far does this all go, man?

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:41.573
Cream corn,
this goes all the way to the top.

01:08:41.742 --> 01:08:45.745
And when I say top,
I mean the tippety-top.

01:08:45.912 --> 01:08:48.872
There it is, black dynamite.
The honky house.

01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:50.750
I'm going down.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:52.919
- This shouldn't take long.
- Whoa, hey...

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:55.505
- Take the controls.
- What are you talking about?

01:08:57.091 --> 01:08:58.466
Whoa, hey, hey, man.

01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:02.970
Son of a bitch.

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:10.937
Cream corn, no!

01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:34.896
I should have known it was you
all the time.

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:39.317
I should have asked myself,
"who's the man so wicked...

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:42.487
So cruel to serve smack
to the orphanage...

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:47.534
Kill my brother Jimmy, and put out
a drug to shrink black men's dicks?"

01:10:48.035 --> 01:10:52.205
Only one man,
and that's you, tricky dick.

01:10:57.586 --> 01:11:01.548
So I'm here to deliver you one
presidential ass-whooping.

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:05.135
Black dynamite.

01:11:05.761 --> 01:11:08.054
There is a perfectly...

01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:13.101
Reasonable explanation for that.

01:11:18.732 --> 01:11:21.067
Showtime, motherfucker.

01:11:21.235 --> 01:11:23.236
Fucking...

01:11:24.572 --> 01:11:26.739
Black dynamite.

01:11:27.158 --> 01:11:29.075
Who the fuck would duck?

01:11:31.162 --> 01:11:33.246
Piece of shit.

01:11:58.606 --> 01:11:59.939
Don't fuck with me.

01:12:00.441 --> 01:12:02.609
Motherfucker.

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:29.844
Take your filthy black hands
off the presidential dinnerware...

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:31.638
You moon cricket.

01:13:34.451 --> 01:13:37.912
And now, black dynamite,
you must die.

01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:52.635
You had enough, Mr. President?

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:56.264
You'll never get away with this.

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:58.433
Watch me,
you little insecure cracker.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.393
You think
by shrinking our Johnsons...

01:14:00.561 --> 01:14:02.603
It's gonna make your situation
any better?

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:06.107
That's your problem, tricky dick.
You are paranoid.

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:08.651
Like sending those two-bit crooks
to Watergate.

01:14:08.819 --> 01:14:10.445
For what?

01:14:11.071 --> 01:14:12.780
For these?

01:14:14.742 --> 01:14:15.742
- Look at you.
- What?

01:14:15.909 --> 01:14:17.910
You lost it all, Turkey.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.665
- Kill me.
- Say what?

01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:25.209
- Kill me.
- No.

01:14:25.377 --> 01:14:26.878
That's the easy way out for you.

01:14:27.046 --> 01:14:29.922
Unless you want the rest
of this freaky shit to hit the news...

01:14:30.090 --> 01:14:32.342
I suggest you take care
of me and my people.

01:14:32.509 --> 01:14:33.551
Can you dig it?

01:14:34.928 --> 01:14:36.429
I said, can you dig it?

01:14:36.597 --> 01:14:37.972
Yes, I can dig it.

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:40.224
Thought you could.

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:13.800
First lady, I'm sorry I pimp-slapped
you into that China cabinet.

01:15:13.967 --> 01:15:16.386
I used excessive force.

01:15:16.553 --> 01:15:18.638
Oftentimes, I cross the line...

01:15:18.806 --> 01:15:21.641
But I try to do so
in the name of what's right.

01:15:21.809 --> 01:15:24.727
Most of the time,
the ends justifies the means.

01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:29.190
But in this case, I feel like I betrayed
my own code of ethics...

01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:32.235
And for that, sugar, I apologize.

01:15:32.653 --> 01:15:34.654
But I shot at you.

01:15:34.822 --> 01:15:37.156
I tried to kill you, black dynamite.

01:15:37.783 --> 01:15:40.701
This is true,
but you did not connect.

01:15:40.869 --> 01:15:42.161
You shot a plate.

01:15:42.329 --> 01:15:45.248
Had you connected,
maybe pimp-slapping you into that...

01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:47.250
Might have been justified.

01:15:47.418 --> 01:15:49.544
But I feel I crossed the line.

01:15:49.711 --> 01:15:52.505
And for that,
please accept my apology.

01:15:53.257 --> 01:15:54.340
I do.

01:15:54.508 --> 01:15:55.967
I do, it's just...

01:15:56.135 --> 01:15:59.679
Oh, black dynamite,
you're so righteous.

01:15:59.847 --> 01:16:02.056
This is also true.

01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:04.016
Because
whenever there's injustice...

01:16:04.935 --> 01:16:06.018
Wrongs to be...

01:16:06.186 --> 01:16:08.563
Oh, black dynamite.

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:12.775
Go on, honey.

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:17.864
Because wherever there's injustice,
wrongs to be righted...

01:16:18.031 --> 01:16:21.200
Innocents to be defended,
black dynamite will be there...

01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:23.703
Delivering ass-whoopings.

01:16:23.871 --> 01:16:26.873
And I will not hesitate to lay
the hammer down on any clown...

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:28.374
That comes around.

01:16:28.542 --> 01:16:32.378
Because if they wanna fight,
they best come see me...

01:16:32.546 --> 01:16:35.173
Because I'm black dynamite.

01:19:36.063 --> 01:19:38.356
How you doing
with that midget girl you sent out?

01:19:38.523 --> 01:19:41.067
Man, she keeps coming up short.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.166
And better no nigga
mess with me, neither.

01:19:57.334 --> 01:20:01.003
I would jump on him,
all 93 pounds of dynamite.

01:20:01.171 --> 01:20:03.005
That's right.

01:20:15.769 --> 01:20:19.980
So I says, "bitch, you look like
you need a pimp in your life."

01:20:20.148 --> 01:20:21.816
She said, "I got a pimp."

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:24.694
I said,
"shit, that nigga ain't no pimp.

01:20:24.861 --> 01:20:27.238
He a valet for ho's."

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:38.582
It's called the
mo bitches variety pack.

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:39.792
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:43.671
I send out a big ho, a little ho,
a skinny ho, and one navajo.

01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:46.590
- Is that right?
- That's right.

01:21:12.492 --> 01:21:14.660
Take that, you cracker-ass cracker.

01:21:14.828 --> 01:21:18.497
All right, girls, let's take them down.

01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:43.481
I only do two things well
in this world.

01:21:43.648 --> 01:21:49.195
I take money from bitches
and I sell drugs to the community.

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.714
I had to send your ho back
the other day.

01:22:08.882 --> 01:22:10.132
- No?
- Yeah, man.

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:14.011
She reckless eyeballing
and carrying on.

01:22:14.179 --> 01:22:18.265
She fine, but I said,
"hey, your man is bona fide."

01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:20.559
See? You're a righteous pimp.

01:22:20.727 --> 01:22:23.020
Shit, the real pimping lives here.

01:22:23.188 --> 01:22:24.438
It ain't ego.

01:22:24.606 --> 01:22:27.107
That's how we go. You like that?

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:55.761
You gotta cross the lines sometimes.

01:22:56.763 --> 01:23:01.308
Sometimes to do the right thing,
you got to do the ugly thing.

01:23:03.603 --> 01:23:07.022
You know people, they don't want
to see the cow killed...

01:23:07.190 --> 01:23:09.066
They just want their steak
on a plate.

01:23:09.234 --> 01:23:10.568
Can you dig it?

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:34.633
Good evening, gentlemen.

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:38.262
Who let that nigga in my house?
