00:01.001 --> 00:02.961
[man] When I agreed
to launder money for Townsend,

00:03.044 --> 00:04.796
you said it would fly under the radar.

00:04.879 --> 00:07.382
Now I've got the IRS
breathing down my neck.

00:07.465 --> 00:09.884
Have you spoken with any associates
about our arrangement?

00:09.968 --> 00:12.137
Did you hear? I could go to prison.

00:12.220 --> 00:15.682
-Your associates, do they know?
-Just Charlie.

00:16.391 --> 00:19.060
I had to. He does our accounting.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.563
I don't have a good feeling about this.
Do you?

00:21.646 --> 00:24.983
Corporate sent this guy
to advise about the IRS thing.

00:25.066 --> 00:26.609
He's like a consultant.

00:26.693 --> 00:30.030
We have nothing to worry about.
Companies get audited all the time.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.407
Yeah. Right.

00:32.490 --> 00:35.535
[dramatic music playing]

00:35.618 --> 00:37.245
I think we're all set here.

00:38.663 --> 00:41.916
What's the plan?
You said you were taking care of this!

00:42.000 --> 00:44.002
I've already taken care of it.

00:44.085 --> 00:47.005
By this time tomorrow,
the audit will be closed.

00:47.088 --> 00:50.008
If it's taken care of, why are you here?

00:50.091 --> 00:52.469
To ask you to move away from the window.

00:53.928 --> 00:55.263
Wait, wait, wait.

00:55.346 --> 00:56.723
Please.

00:56.806 --> 00:58.600
-No. No, no.
-[silenced gunshot]

01:02.020 --> 01:03.104
[chattering]

01:03.188 --> 01:07.108
Ladies, if you don't mind.
Where's Charlie?

01:08.234 --> 01:10.361
I don't know. He was here. Should we wait?

01:10.445 --> 01:12.322
No need. This will be quick.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.705
[silenced gunshots]

01:57.992 --> 02:00.495
Send in the crew. It's time to disinfect.

02:01.204 --> 02:03.665
Tell Obenrader there's one loose end.

02:13.049 --> 02:14.217
How's Teva?

02:14.300 --> 02:16.469
She graduates from Boston University
in May.

02:16.553 --> 02:17.804
It's been four years?

02:17.887 --> 02:22.100
-She wouldn't be there if it not for him.
-No, no, no. It was all Teva.

02:22.183 --> 02:25.395
Although I do write
an excellent recommendation letter.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.313
It's an endangered talent.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.691
I hope you asked me here
to pay back the favor.

02:29.774 --> 02:33.319
You need something boosted,
tell me where and when, I'll send me crew.

02:33.403 --> 02:37.198
Thom, rumor has it
your crew does work for Neville Townsend.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.700
We freelance for him.

02:38.783 --> 02:44.247
The occasional gig. He picks the target,
we do the job. Proceeds get split 60-40.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.999
Actually, they don't.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.042
What are you talking about?

02:48.126 --> 02:50.211
Luis Espinoza. You know him?

02:50.295 --> 02:52.964
Sure. The jobs for Townsend,
he assigns them.

02:53.047 --> 02:55.758
To you and everyone else.

02:55.842 --> 02:59.637
Espinoza manages all of Townsend's
heisting and boosting,

02:59.721 --> 03:01.389
his capers and pilferage.

03:01.472 --> 03:04.183
He decides which crews work on which jobs.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.603
Now, you take 40 percent.

03:07.520 --> 03:12.108
The crews he prefers to assign
take 30 and kick back 10 to him.

03:12.191 --> 03:14.861
Knowing you to be a principled thief,

03:14.944 --> 03:17.739
I assume that's not a wheel
you are greasing.

03:17.822 --> 03:22.160
It's not. Which could explain why Espinoza
just pulled us off a job in Berlin.

03:22.243 --> 03:23.953
Our take would've been seven figures.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.664
Ten percent of which
is now being paid to him

03:26.748 --> 03:28.625
by the crew he sent in your place.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.501
That sniveling weasel.

03:30.585 --> 03:33.046
-Does Townsend know?
-I don't believe so.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.506
If he did, Espinoza would be out.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.676
And here I thought
it was my turn to do you the favor.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.802
[knocking on door]

03:41.012 --> 03:43.181
Please congratulate Teva for us.

03:43.264 --> 03:45.266
If she's interested in law school,

03:45.350 --> 03:48.645
I know the predilections
of several Ivy League deans.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.064
-Nice to see you, old friend.
-You too.

03:51.147 --> 03:54.067
-Thom McCarty?
-Yeah. We know each other?

03:54.150 --> 03:56.152
No. Only by reputation.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.112
Thom, this is Donald Ressler.

03:58.196 --> 04:02.492
Careful what you say. Black shoes,
cheap suit, flat stomach, regulation cut.

04:02.575 --> 04:06.371
Don't get me wrong, he's bent,
just not as bent as we might like.

04:06.454 --> 04:09.165
-I'll be on me way, then.
-Safe travels, Thom.

04:10.750 --> 04:15.255
-Why must you always be early?
-Why must you only associate with crooks?

04:15.838 --> 04:17.757
Criminals, Donald, not crooks.

04:18.549 --> 04:21.511
Call a prostitute an escort,
she's still a hooker.

04:22.303 --> 04:26.557
After all these years, you still see
the world in black and white.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.644
Oh, I see in gray.
I just do my best to avoid it.

04:29.727 --> 04:32.105
Along with small talk.
You said you had a case?

04:32.188 --> 04:33.564
More like a riddle.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.526
I recently learned
that Townsend laundered money

04:36.609 --> 04:40.029
through a listing agency
called Kelmund Realty.

04:40.113 --> 04:44.534
Unfortunately, the cooked books
came to the attention of the IRS.

04:44.617 --> 04:48.204
-Sounds fortunate to me.
-If looked at in black and white.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.831
The gray of it is,

04:49.914 --> 04:54.836
72 hours after the IRS gave Kelmund
notice of an audit,

04:55.378 --> 04:56.754
they no longer exist.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.047
They vanished.

04:58.131 --> 05:01.843
The employees, their accounts,
employment records,

05:01.926 --> 05:07.598
articles of incorporation, gone,
along with the IRS audit.

05:07.682 --> 05:10.268
So the riddle is how they pulled off
this magic trick.

05:10.351 --> 05:12.687
It's not the how, Donald. It's the who.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.815
Nicholas Obenrader.

05:15.898 --> 05:19.736
[Ressler] 2009, Yakuza profits dip
during the Great Recession.

05:19.819 --> 05:23.197
2012, Brazil's two largest gangs merge.

05:23.781 --> 05:27.076
2018,
the head of Le Milieu is assassinated,

05:27.160 --> 05:28.619
creating a power vacuum.

05:28.703 --> 05:31.914
Three continents,
three criminal enterprises in crisis,

05:31.998 --> 05:35.960
and, according to Reddington,
one common thread: Nicholas Obenrader.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.755
A management consultant
to criminal organizations.

05:38.838 --> 05:42.341
For the Yakuza, he rerouted laundered
assets through tax havens like Ireland.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.177
He was a headhunter for Le Milieu.

05:44.260 --> 05:47.388
In Brazil, he oversaw
the downsizing after the merger.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.390
How do you downsize a criminal enterprise?

05:50.266 --> 05:53.936
<i>Do people get a golden parachute</i>
<i>or a bullet to the head?</i>

05:54.520 --> 05:57.231
Dump and cover. We're out of here in 15.

05:59.275 --> 06:02.612
Mr. Obenrader,
this is the one Becker said got away.

06:04.739 --> 06:07.533
Tell Becker he's fired.
I don't like loose ends.

06:08.951 --> 06:11.245
I'll take care of this one myself.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.539
[Ressler] <i>Obenrader's in-house</i>
<i>for Townsend.</i>

06:13.623 --> 06:15.124
[Aram] <i>That's why he gave us this case.</i>

06:15.208 --> 06:18.336
If Townsend hired Obenrader
as his consultant,

06:18.419 --> 06:20.505
<i>he'll know everything</i>
<i>about his organization.</i>

06:20.588 --> 06:23.758
It's done.
I still have one more loose end to tie up.

06:23.841 --> 06:27.136
<i>But your IRS problem</i>
<i>is no longer a problem.</i>

06:27.220 --> 06:30.598
Good, because it seems I may have
another problem I need your help with.

06:30.681 --> 06:35.144
It's come to my attention that Espinoza
may be feathering his own nest.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.356
If that's true,
I'll be looking for a replacement.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.025
[Park] <i>Do we have photos of Obenrader?</i>

06:41.109 --> 06:44.445
No photos, prints, or surveillance.
Obenrader's an alias.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.531
We know what he does, just not who he is.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.574
He may have made Kelmund Realty
disappear on paper,

06:48.658 --> 06:50.243
-[phone rings]
-but they had an office.

06:50.326 --> 06:52.286
Go to it. See what you can find.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.663
Harold Cooper.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.748
Have you read the messages?

06:55.832 --> 06:59.210
<i>The ones Reddington</i>
<i>and his handler exchanged.</i>

06:59.293 --> 07:02.004
Yes, we all have. You're on with the team.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.173
Well, what did they say?

07:05.591 --> 07:07.760
<i>Any news on these mysterious assets?</i>

07:08.636 --> 07:11.722
No. The messages were urgent and vague.

07:11.806 --> 07:15.393
But we were able to identify an address,
a cafe in Paris.

07:15.476 --> 07:18.771
It was referred to a couple of times
in past messages and once recently.

07:18.855 --> 07:23.067
We're hoping to pull a surveillance image
or maybe get a positive ID on the handler.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.694
I'm sending Aram to investigate.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.280
April in Paris.
Have fun at the strip mall.

07:27.363 --> 07:28.698
[Agnes] <i>Mommy, I'm done.</i>

07:28.781 --> 07:30.491
Oh. I'll be right there, honey.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.494
Agnes. How's she doing?

07:34.954 --> 07:36.038
She's really good.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.168
But I think we'll all be a lot better
when this is done.

07:41.335 --> 07:43.254
<i>So, what's the address in Paris?</i>

07:50.261 --> 07:51.679
I wanna help.

07:51.762 --> 07:54.682
I think it would be best
if we took care of this.

07:54.765 --> 07:57.894
I'm the reason you know to go to Paris.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.229
I got you the messages to decrypt.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.398
Which is why we shared with you
what they said.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.193
If Aram gets a positive ID
on Reddington's handler,

08:05.276 --> 08:06.736
will you share that with me too?

08:06.819 --> 08:10.781
No. But hopefully we can question him
and find out what he knows.

08:10.865 --> 08:13.409
What he knows is Reddington is N-13.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.996
If or when he tells us that,
we will take the appropriate action.

08:17.079 --> 08:19.499
<i>Appropriate action? Against Reddington?</i>

08:19.582 --> 08:21.834
We all know that's never gonna happen.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.711
[Cooper]
<i>It will if he's an enemy of the state.</i>

08:23.794 --> 08:25.671
Sit tight, let us do our job.

08:27.089 --> 08:30.635
I sometimes forget.
All this, and she has a child with her.

08:30.718 --> 08:34.388
Liz's mom abandoned her.
She would never do the same to Agnes.

08:35.806 --> 08:38.434
I don't understand
why you think this is a crime scene.

08:38.518 --> 08:42.396
Two and two doesn't equal five.
Did they skip out on the rent?

08:42.480 --> 08:44.440
No. They're paid up
for the next six months.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.943
-Any forwarding address?
-No address, no phone number.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.612
-What bank was the rent check drawn from?
-They paid cash.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.447
[Ressler] Okay, so let's do the math.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.991
They disappear
after paying half a year's rent in cash,

08:54.075 --> 08:56.827
leave no forwarding address
or phone number,

08:56.911 --> 09:00.748
and all of this after they find out
that the IRS is auditing them.

09:00.831 --> 09:02.416
Does that add up to you?

09:03.042 --> 09:05.419
Office was scrubbed.
No prints or personal effects,

09:05.503 --> 09:07.213
but there's one thing you should see.

09:07.296 --> 09:10.508
Found blood on the windowsill
in the back storage room.

09:10.591 --> 09:13.094
Run it for DNA.
See if we can't get a match.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.556
-Looks like we got a runner.
-Yeah. But from what?

09:17.598 --> 09:19.809
[grunting]

09:19.892 --> 09:24.146
-If now's not a good time--
-Loyalty, Godwin. Loyalty and trust.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.107
Nothing matters more.

09:26.190 --> 09:30.361
About that. I'm concerned
Keen may be feeding the FBI information.

09:30.444 --> 09:33.656
Or she's using them
to feed information to us.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.117
You asked me to monitor
her communications with them.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.327
Her contact is Agent Donald Ressler.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.788
Who's whispering sweet nothings to whom?

09:40.871 --> 09:41.998
[Godwin] We'll know soon.

09:42.081 --> 09:46.168
Keen changes her burner regularly,
but Ressler's phone is FBI-issue.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.796
I reached out to our bureau asset.
We're up on his line.

09:48.879 --> 09:50.131
I trust Keen.

09:50.965 --> 09:55.845
But then again, I trusted Espinoza!
And look what that got me.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.058
My problem is, I'm just too trusting.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.436
Aren't I, Mr. Espinoza?

10:06.939 --> 10:08.149
Call Obenrader.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.484
Tell him to put his headhunter hat on.

10:10.568 --> 10:15.156
Tell him that Espinoza's
employment contract has been terminated.

10:21.203 --> 10:23.581
[Ressler]
The blood belonged to a Charles Totten.

10:23.664 --> 10:25.583
Must have cut himself trying to escape.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.835
The employees at Kelmund Realty
didn't disappear.

10:27.918 --> 10:30.755
They were professionally cleaned,
along with their prints and hard drives.

10:30.838 --> 10:33.799
We sent a unit to Totten's home.
He's not answering his phone.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.802
We traced a credit-card purchase
to a gas station in Deer Lake.

10:36.886 --> 10:40.681
Homeowners in the area include
a William Totten. Could be his brother.

10:40.765 --> 10:45.019
If you're right and Totten is a loose end,
Obenrader knows and will wanna tie it off.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.979
We need to get to him first.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.244
Hello.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.246
[car door opens]

11:04.955 --> 11:06.916
-Whoa. Whoa.
-Hey.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.085
What are you doing here? Who's he?

11:09.168 --> 11:11.253
Oh, Rocco's my security.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.339
Rocco. Rocco. Really?

11:13.422 --> 11:15.716
I hope there's a croissant in there.

11:15.800 --> 11:16.842
I am starving.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.470
[dramatic music playing]

11:19.553 --> 11:21.222
Ah! Yes.

11:21.305 --> 11:23.808
Did Mr. Cooper change his mind
about you helping out?

11:25.184 --> 11:27.520
I don't know. Maybe.

11:27.603 --> 11:30.856
Maybe, which means no, which means
you're not supposed to be here.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.650
This is so delicious.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.652
-You want a bite?
-Not anymore.

11:34.735 --> 11:37.863
-Don't be a spoilsport.
-I wasn't until you showed up.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.949
And just how did you show up?

11:40.032 --> 11:41.992
How exactly did you find me?

11:42.076 --> 11:44.912
Well, I know the FBI
flies into Le Bourget.

11:44.995 --> 11:46.205
I know you use G5s.

11:46.288 --> 11:48.416
Le Bourget, G5.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.001
<i>Et voilà!</i> Shall we?

11:51.752 --> 11:53.087
[stammering]

11:53.170 --> 11:56.424
Whoa. You are not going in there with me.

11:57.007 --> 11:59.468
I did not come all this way
just to eat your croissant.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.221
Fine.

12:02.304 --> 12:05.516
But we go in as cops, not criminals.

12:05.599 --> 12:06.892
We follow the rules.

12:07.643 --> 12:11.355
-Can you do that?
-There's only one way to find out.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.860
Wait. Please wait.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.909
[jazz playing over speakers]

12:25.744 --> 12:27.997
[speaking in French]
Excuse me. Good morning.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.249
Agents Mojtabai

12:30.416 --> 12:34.420
and Keen. We work for the... FBI.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.172
[in English] So what?

12:36.797 --> 12:38.632
Ah. [speaks in French]
You speak English.

12:38.716 --> 12:41.135
[in English] He speaks English.
Okay, <i>magnifique.</i>

12:41.218 --> 12:44.096
So we believe
that two people we're investigating

12:44.180 --> 12:46.515
have met here on a number of occasions.

12:46.599 --> 12:50.644
Now, we know who one of the men is,
but not the other and, well,

12:50.728 --> 12:52.980
looking at your security footage

12:53.063 --> 12:55.983
would go a long way
to helping us figure that out.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.902
Forget it. I'm not helping you.

12:57.985 --> 13:00.154
-I'm a bartender, not an informant.
-No, no, no.

13:00.237 --> 13:04.950
Believe me, I understand, but these are
really bad people doing terrible things.

13:05.534 --> 13:07.578
Yeah? Like what?

13:07.661 --> 13:11.749
Well, for starters, they love
pointing guns at people's heads.

13:11.832 --> 13:13.751
Whoa. No! Whoa. Rocco, Rocco!

13:13.834 --> 13:17.296
And when they don't get their way,
they pull the trigger.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.089
He said you are FBI.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.549
He's FBI.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.302
Rocco's certifiable...

13:24.512 --> 13:26.847
so how about those security feeds?

13:30.518 --> 13:31.685
[footsteps approaching]

13:32.561 --> 13:35.231
-Remy, how was the race?
-Unfinished.

13:35.814 --> 13:38.108
I found him
right at the end of the biking leg.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.986
Imagine my surprise
seeing Dembe in Sarasota.

13:41.070 --> 13:45.032
-I know. I haven't called you back.
-It's true. You have been dodgy.

13:45.115 --> 13:49.036
But if you had picked up when I called,
I never would have learned

13:49.119 --> 13:53.415
there was such a singularly dreadful thing
as an Ironman.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.626
You've never heard of an Ironman?

13:56.001 --> 13:59.004
Not unless you're referring
to Rodin's <i>Balzac.</i>

13:59.088 --> 14:02.091
There's a funny phrase, "Rodin's <i>Balzac."</i>

14:02.174 --> 14:07.263
Although that's bronze, not iron, so, no,
I've never heard of one. Please, hydrate.

14:09.265 --> 14:12.059
And answer the question
I called you about.

14:12.142 --> 14:13.477
[tense music playing]

14:13.561 --> 14:16.939
You said you wanted to talk to Priya.
She's my most valuable asset.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.984
Which is why
I want her to be an asset of mine.

14:20.067 --> 14:23.988
If she agrees,
I'll compensate you for your loss.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.865
Pennies on the dollar.

14:25.948 --> 14:29.743
"Pennies on the dollar"?
Dembe, are you listening to this?

14:29.827 --> 14:34.206
Penny--? I've never paid
pennies on the dollar in my life.

14:34.290 --> 14:37.418
If I'm known for anything,
it's for overpaying.

14:37.501 --> 14:41.255
He's forever trying
to get me to show some restraint.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.340
But we can resolve this right now.

14:43.424 --> 14:46.176
I can get Edward to take it up
to a few thousand feet,

14:46.260 --> 14:49.179
circle back around,
come in over the 18th hole,

14:49.263 --> 14:52.182
and drop you right into the grandstand.

14:52.266 --> 14:55.394
We've done it before,
I'm sure we'll do it again.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.479
[suspenseful music playing]

15:00.441 --> 15:04.194
She's in London.
A client hired her to recover a rare book.

15:04.278 --> 15:07.698
She's schedule to deliver it to him
at Ingram Rare Books in Kensington.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.200
Good. Off you go.

15:10.284 --> 15:15.456
Dembe will drop you wherever you like.
If I were you, I'd like the finish line.

15:20.669 --> 15:22.421
I wanna ask you a question.

15:24.006 --> 15:25.925
And I need an honest answer.

15:27.551 --> 15:28.552
Okay.

15:30.095 --> 15:33.432
If the bartender hadn't
given us the surveillance video,

15:33.515 --> 15:36.435
would you have let Rocco shoot him?

15:38.437 --> 15:39.271
No.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.738
Is Agnes really doing well?

15:49.031 --> 15:50.282
She really is.

15:51.408 --> 15:54.119
Where we live is quiet and peaceful.

15:54.703 --> 15:57.665
I found this amazing woman
to help me with her.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.502
How do you do it?

16:03.128 --> 16:06.006
Stay ahead of us, fight Mr. Reddington,

16:07.132 --> 16:08.133
raise a kid.

16:09.093 --> 16:12.471
I'm not giving you
the <i>Good Housekeeping </i>seal of approval,

16:12.554 --> 16:14.974
but the fact that you can do it all...

16:17.184 --> 16:21.105
I mean, I sit by my computer all day,
and by 8:00, I'm in my pajamas,

16:21.188 --> 16:24.441
eating rainbow sherbet,
watching reruns of <i>Our Planet</i>.

16:26.819 --> 16:30.614
-Thank you.
-It was a question, not a compliment.

16:31.699 --> 16:36.453
It sounded like an acknowledgment.
I don't get a lot of that nowadays.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.085
Can't believe you ate my croissant.

16:43.961 --> 16:46.755
Of all the things you've done,
that might be one of the worst.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.132
I've done some awful things.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.843
I know. That's how much
I was looking forward to eating it.

16:50.926 --> 16:55.889
I'll tell you what. After this is over,
I'll buy you a pâtisserie.

16:57.307 --> 16:58.142
You're that rich?

16:58.225 --> 17:01.854
Whoever said crime doesn't pay
wasn't very good at it.

17:02.855 --> 17:03.856
[mutters indistinctly]

17:04.356 --> 17:05.190
Whoa, whoa.

17:05.774 --> 17:06.650
There we go.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.736
[suspenseful music playing]

17:09.361 --> 17:10.946
There's Mr. Reddington.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.241
Which means
that little fella must be his handler.

17:25.919 --> 17:26.837
Can I help you?

17:26.920 --> 17:30.049
Agents Ressler and Park. FBI.
Are you William Totten?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.843
Yes. What can I do for you?

17:32.926 --> 17:38.474
-We're looking for your brother Charles.
-Oh, he's not here. Is everything okay?

17:39.933 --> 17:42.728
We'll need to ask you
a few questions about him.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.688
Of course. Come on in.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.742
When was the last time
you saw your brother?

17:57.743 --> 18:00.079
Gosh, must be a couple weeks ago now.

18:00.162 --> 18:03.999
We believe he was in the area yesterday.
He didn't check in?

18:04.083 --> 18:08.337
No. I mean, he comes up here
sometimes to fish, but it's...

18:08.420 --> 18:11.507
[ominous music playing]

18:12.716 --> 18:14.009
Is he in trouble?

18:14.593 --> 18:17.513
[Ressler] I wish I could tell you,
but our investigation's ongoing.

18:20.641 --> 18:21.809
Hands!

18:22.392 --> 18:25.187
[dramatic music playing]

18:29.691 --> 18:32.111
Whoever you are, you're under arrest.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.612
[handcuffs clicking]

18:34.863 --> 18:36.657
[Obenrader]
I don't know who the dead guy is,

18:36.740 --> 18:39.201
and I don't remember how I got there.

18:39.284 --> 18:43.539
All I know
is that I'm not saying any more.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.291
His name was Charles Totten.

18:46.875 --> 18:51.296
<i>So we're clear, the CIA's filing paperwork</i>
<i>to move you to a black site</i>

18:51.380 --> 18:54.174
<i>if you don't start talking about</i>
<i>your relationship with Neville Townsend.</i>

18:54.258 --> 18:56.009
-Sir.
-[knocking on door]

18:56.093 --> 18:57.302
Sir, we got a hit.

18:57.386 --> 19:00.764
I enhanced the image of the man
Mr. Reddington was meeting with in Paris

19:00.848 --> 19:02.391
and ran his face in the database.

19:02.474 --> 19:05.978
Russia desk
kicked him back as one Ivan Stepanov.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.062
He's SVR?

19:07.146 --> 19:07.980
Officially, yes.

19:08.063 --> 19:11.358
Not so officially, he's believed to be
a high-ranking member of Zaslon,

19:11.441 --> 19:13.026
running black op around the globe.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.113
So Keen was right.
Reddington's using coded messages

19:16.196 --> 19:20.200
to arrange clandestine meetings
with a known Russian intelligence officer.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.702
[cell phone rings]

19:21.785 --> 19:25.164
-What are you gonna tell Mr. Reddington?
-About this and Keen? Not a word.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.874
-How was she?
-Infuriating.

19:27.374 --> 19:31.128
But I'd be lying if I said it didn't
feel good to be on the same team again.

19:31.211 --> 19:32.588
I know. Reddington.

19:32.671 --> 19:36.258
<i>Harold. Where are you with Obenrader?</i>
<i>Any progress?</i>

19:36.341 --> 19:39.595
More than.
Agents Park and Ressler brought him in.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.305
<i>Park's interrogating him.</i>

19:41.388 --> 19:43.015
So we're right on schedule.

19:43.098 --> 19:44.516
On schedule for what?

19:45.809 --> 19:48.937
Harold, I'm afraid I have to come clean.

19:49.021 --> 19:53.775
<i>I haven't been entirely forthright</i>
<i>with you on this case,</i>

19:53.859 --> 20:00.782
and I know we discussed being more open
and honest with each other.

20:00.866 --> 20:01.783
We have.

20:01.867 --> 20:07.289
The truth is, I have no expectation
that Mr. Obenrader will talk,

20:07.372 --> 20:14.213
let alone reveal any meaningful details
about Townsend or his organization.

20:14.296 --> 20:20.969
<i>Mr. Obenrader understands the blowback</i>
<i>on his loved ones would be far too great.</i>

20:21.053 --> 20:23.513
-We'll see about that.
<i>-Hold on, Harold.</i>

20:23.597 --> 20:27.017
I didn't put him on your radar
so you could play detective.

20:27.100 --> 20:32.314
I put the man on your radar
so you could help me make a new friend.

20:32.397 --> 20:34.274
How is that supposed to happen?

20:34.358 --> 20:38.612
We're not only in bed with Reddington,
but getting into bed with Priya Laghari?

20:38.695 --> 20:41.156
-Correct.
-Back up. Who's Priya Laghari?

20:41.240 --> 20:44.952
Only a world-renowned thief
who dabbles in jewels and art.

20:45.035 --> 20:46.745
And classified intelligence.

20:46.828 --> 20:50.415
She's been on our radar for years,
but we never came close to catching her.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.960
So instead of arresting her,
we're gonna work with her.

20:53.043 --> 20:56.129
Why enable Reddington,
when he's been lying to us?

20:56.213 --> 21:00.342
Not to pile on, but we did learn
Mr. Reddington has been canoodling

21:00.425 --> 21:02.594
with a Russian intelligence operative
in Paris.

21:02.678 --> 21:06.598
Neville Townsend is dangerous,
to the public and to Elizabeth.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.767
Anything that gets us
closer to him is a win.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.811
I'd rather keep Reddington close

21:10.894 --> 21:13.355
while we look into
his relationship with Ivan Stepanov.

21:13.438 --> 21:16.858
If he finds out we're investigating,
he'll kill him like he killed Rakitin.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.860
Agreed. He better not find out.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.780
We could pull Stepanov off the street.

21:21.863 --> 21:24.950
He's Russian.
The DOJ's never going to approve that.

21:25.033 --> 21:26.576
Liz wouldn't need their approval.

21:27.536 --> 21:30.622
I know. It's a terrible idea
that completely sucks.

21:30.706 --> 21:35.335
We can't trust her. She's not an agent.
And abducting an SVR agent is illegal

21:35.419 --> 21:38.797
and could lead to a huge scandal
if anyone ever found out.

21:38.880 --> 21:42.342
But just let it suck for a second.

21:44.052 --> 21:46.930
-Okay. Still sucks.
-[Cooper] Agree. It's a terrible idea.

21:47.014 --> 21:50.225
But it's possible
that every other idea's worse.

21:50.976 --> 21:54.688
We can't go through official channels
to question an SVR agent.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.898
Yet we find ourselves working with a CI

21:56.982 --> 22:00.402
who may be that SVR agent's
top asset in this country.

22:01.069 --> 22:02.112
You said it.

22:02.195 --> 22:05.657
If Reddington finds out that
we know about Stepanov, he may kill him.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.868
Try as we might to keep it from him,

22:07.951 --> 22:11.496
we know that Reddington
will probably find out what we know.

22:11.997 --> 22:15.625
Which means we have a narrow window
to find and question Stepanov.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.547
Reach out to Keen.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.598
[automated voice] <i>Record at the tone.</i>

22:29.681 --> 22:33.393
[Ressler] <i>Keen. It's me. Reddington's</i>

22:33.477 --> 22:35.729
<i>He's SVR. Likely tied in with Zaslon.</i>

22:35.812 --> 22:37.981
We can't get to him. Not officially.

22:38.065 --> 22:42.986
So Cooper sanctioned an extraction,
and he wants you to do the extracting.

22:56.124 --> 22:57.042
[rings]

23:01.963 --> 23:02.923
Do you have it?

23:06.176 --> 23:09.846
-How did you get it through Customs?
-Packed in my underwear in my suitcase.

23:10.972 --> 23:15.560
You packed a lost book
from the 14th century with your knickers?

23:15.644 --> 23:17.145
You want it or not?

23:18.939 --> 23:20.482
The cash is inside.

23:20.565 --> 23:22.234
[pensive music playing]

23:43.463 --> 23:44.297

Oh, my God.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.385
[groaning]

23:48.468 --> 23:50.428
Oh, my stars.

23:51.346 --> 23:54.641
I've dozed off in caves and coffins,

23:55.142 --> 23:59.855
even squeezed between the inside
and outside of the hull of a cargo plane,

24:00.814 --> 24:05.944
but my hand to God, I have not
slept that soundly since math class.

24:06.027 --> 24:08.947
What's going on? How did you get in here?

24:09.030 --> 24:11.158
Uh-uh. Priya, not so fast.

24:11.241 --> 24:14.452
-I'll get to the bottom of this.
-I wouldn't bet on it.

24:15.704 --> 24:16.872
What is this?

24:16.955 --> 24:19.833
This is where Nigel walks
so you and I can talk.

24:21.001 --> 24:24.713
Please close the door.
I'd like this part to be private.

24:31.428 --> 24:34.014
[Ressler on recording] <i>Reddington's</i>

No more than ten minutes.

Any contact since?

[Vandyke] If she called him,
it wasn't on the cell we tapped.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.240
Sir, I believe you have to ask yourself

24:52.324 --> 24:55.285
why Miss Keen is working with the bureau.

24:55.368 --> 24:58.413
She said she came to you
because she couldn't trust the bureau.

24:58.496 --> 25:01.041
-They couldn't trust her.
-[Vandyke] If they're right,

25:01.124 --> 25:04.628
if they've ID'd Reddington's handler,
that's a game changer.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.257
Have our people in Moscow
get eyes on Stepanov,

25:09.341 --> 25:11.343
and tell Roman to assemble a team.

25:11.426 --> 25:12.594
What about Keen?

25:13.178 --> 25:15.722
[Townsend] <i>Give her a job,</i>
<i>doesn't matter what it is.</i>

25:15.805 --> 25:21.228
<i>Keep her here and keep her occupied</i>
<i>until we know what we're dealing with.</i>

25:21.895 --> 25:25.273
Elizabeth, you have a moment?
Mr. Townsend's asking.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.984
Uh... Sure thing. What's going on?

25:30.528 --> 25:32.030
This is a first.

25:32.614 --> 25:37.369
Typically, clients want me to
break into safes, not meet inside of them.

25:37.452 --> 25:40.247
I would think it a terrible curse
to be typical.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.875
Let me guess. I stole something from you.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.502
A painting, jewelry?

25:46.294 --> 25:47.545
Your heart?

25:47.629 --> 25:49.756
I want to be your angel.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.467
Not interested.

25:53.468 --> 25:57.722
I imagine they'd be terribly expensive,
these heists you pull.

25:57.806 --> 26:03.228
All those gadgets and gizmos,
the glass-cutters and suction cups.

26:03.311 --> 26:05.605
Have you ever scaled a glass building?

26:06.189 --> 26:07.649
-It's on my list.
-Good.

26:07.732 --> 26:10.026
I hope that list is a long one.

26:10.110 --> 26:13.405
Because whatever is on it,
I'm here to provide.

26:13.488 --> 26:17.409
Not just money or toys, they're easy.

26:17.492 --> 26:19.286
I'm talking about a life.

26:19.786 --> 26:22.414
One where you can
walk away from your clients

26:22.497 --> 26:25.125
and thieve just for the fun of it.

26:26.042 --> 26:27.419
I know who you are.

26:27.502 --> 26:32.048
Then you know I can afford to make this
the last job you ever have to take.

26:32.549 --> 26:35.176
One job. That's all I need.

26:38.471 --> 26:40.598
-What do I have to steal?
-Nothing.

26:40.682 --> 26:44.561
I want you to infiltrate
Neville Townsend's organization.

26:47.856 --> 26:48.773
Get up.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.317
What's going on?

26:51.609 --> 26:53.111
You're taking a trip.

26:56.364 --> 26:58.033
[Obenrader] Where are you taking me?

26:58.116 --> 27:00.452
[pensive music playing]

27:00.535 --> 27:02.370
You can't just transport me.

27:04.664 --> 27:06.374
I have rights.

27:07.625 --> 27:09.627
I haven't spoken to my lawyer.

27:09.711 --> 27:12.130
Where you're headed, Nicholas,
you don't get a lawyer.

27:12.714 --> 27:14.424
D-6 inbound. Cargo on deck.

27:15.216 --> 27:16.217
[man] <i>Copy that.</i>

27:32.442 --> 27:35.653
-He give you any trouble?
-No. Is that the paperwork?

27:37.530 --> 27:39.616
Who are these guys? What is this?

27:40.700 --> 27:42.577
We gave you a chance. It's their turn.

27:43.578 --> 27:45.789
Whose turn? Where are you taking me?

27:45.872 --> 27:49.250
It's a long flight.
You gotta take a whiz, do that now.

27:50.668 --> 27:51.878
Gun!

27:52.253 --> 27:53.630
[gunshots]

28:02.305 --> 28:04.974
What's going on? Who are you?

28:05.058 --> 28:07.644
I can tell you who we're not. The CIA.

28:07.727 --> 28:09.604
And that's good news for you.

28:18.363 --> 28:19.447
You okay?

28:21.157 --> 28:22.617
Yeah. I'm fine.

28:23.451 --> 28:24.577
[groans]

28:24.661 --> 28:25.829
Think he bought it?

28:27.372 --> 28:28.665
I mean, I bought it.

28:31.209 --> 28:34.921
You know what I love?
I love a good mystery.

28:35.004 --> 28:37.382
Like, what's in all these boxes?

28:37.465 --> 28:40.969
Of course, a mystery is only as good
as the story around it.

28:41.052 --> 28:42.679
So here's yours...

28:42.762 --> 28:46.850
Ten minutes ago,
you were headed for a black site,

28:46.933 --> 28:50.186
scratchy polyester jumpsuits,

28:50.270 --> 28:53.898
bright lights all night, horrific food,

28:53.982 --> 28:55.775
crushing solitude.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.026
Irrelevance.

28:57.110 --> 28:58.486
I appreciate what you did.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.572
I would happily return the favor

29:00.655 --> 29:03.992
by doing a thorough overview
of your entire organization,

29:04.075 --> 29:05.452
-free of charge.
-[laughs]

29:05.535 --> 29:06.870
Oh, my gosh.

29:06.953 --> 29:08.413
The things you'd find.

29:08.496 --> 29:13.209
Square pegs in round holes,
misfits and outliers.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.712
But you know what? I like it that way.

29:15.795 --> 29:17.547
I trust how it feels.

29:17.630 --> 29:21.801
The only things I consult
are my gut and my friend.

29:21.885 --> 29:24.137
Why did your gut tell you to save me?

29:24.220 --> 29:27.891
How do you know it wasn't my friend?
But I digress.

29:27.974 --> 29:34.147
Neville Townsend asked you to find someone
to manage the heist crews he employs.

29:34.230 --> 29:35.190
I have a candidate.

29:35.273 --> 29:37.150
I don't discuss client business.

29:37.233 --> 29:39.694
I'm sure you can appreciate
the need for discretion.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.529
I can and I do.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.866
But I find myself in the unusual position

29:44.949 --> 29:48.369
where indiscretion
is the better part of valor.

29:48.453 --> 29:50.747
So allow me to be indiscreet.

29:50.830 --> 29:52.999
"Spoiler alert," as they say.

29:53.082 --> 29:59.339
The boxes contain an exhaustive
archival record of your clients.

29:59.422 --> 30:02.217
Names, dates, numbers.

30:02.300 --> 30:07.472
A who, what, where, when and how
of your livelihood.

30:08.056 --> 30:10.725
That's the mystery. My client list.

30:10.809 --> 30:11.768
It is.

30:11.851 --> 30:15.939
And what I might do with your client list.

30:17.607 --> 30:18.650
Who's the candidate?

30:18.733 --> 30:19.901
Priya Laghari.

30:19.984 --> 30:22.278
I assume her reputation precedes her.

30:22.362 --> 30:25.824
The Iranian nuclear deal.
The Matisse in Rotterdam.

30:26.366 --> 30:29.285
Normally I'd consider myself lucky
to find a worthy replacement.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.204
Luck had nothing to do with it.

30:31.287 --> 30:34.207
I need someone
inside Townsend's organization.

30:34.290 --> 30:36.876
So I soured him on Espinoza.

30:36.960 --> 30:40.964
Townsend took him out,
called you in, and here we are.

30:41.047 --> 30:43.591
I consult with Mr. Townsend
about personnel,

30:43.675 --> 30:46.469
avoiding redundancy
and profit maximization.

30:46.553 --> 30:50.682
I have no interest
in his politics or rivalries.

30:50.765 --> 30:53.601
Or in placing a mole
within his organization.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.521
Fine. Then you can volunteer.

30:58.106 --> 31:01.818
I consult with Mr. Townsend virtually
or over the phone. We've never met.

31:01.901 --> 31:03.862
I don't even know where he works.

31:03.945 --> 31:05.238
Miss Laghari, then.

31:05.321 --> 31:06.990
Advocate for her

31:07.073 --> 31:09.784
and you can keep your client list
to yourself.

31:14.038 --> 31:16.082
[Townsend] Obenrader raved about her.

31:16.165 --> 31:19.294
You can see why.
Laghari has an outstanding resume.

31:19.377 --> 31:21.212
Why are you showing this to me?

31:21.296 --> 31:22.630
I value your opinion.

31:22.714 --> 31:25.425
About what thief to hire?

31:26.134 --> 31:29.053
We're partners in going after Reddington.

31:29.137 --> 31:32.390
When that ends,
I'm hoping our partnership can continue.

31:32.473 --> 31:35.894
Don't say no until you let me
show you more of what I do.

31:35.977 --> 31:38.771
Starting with Laghari.
I'd like you to bring her in.

31:39.939 --> 31:42.400
Now? I have a meeting with someone else.

31:42.483 --> 31:44.736
Excuse me. I've heard from Vandyke.

31:44.819 --> 31:45.987
[tense music playing]

31:46.070 --> 31:49.991
The pickup instructions are in the file.
This is important to me.

31:50.074 --> 31:52.243
This person you're supposed to meet,

31:52.327 --> 31:55.163
is there any chance
you can meet them later?

31:57.540 --> 31:58.541
Of course.

32:05.465 --> 32:08.343
Our man in Moscow
confirmed Stepanov's location.

32:09.302 --> 32:11.054
I want it done quickly.

32:11.137 --> 32:12.221
I've stalled Keen,

32:12.305 --> 32:14.349
but she may already have assets
on the ground.

32:14.432 --> 32:17.518
What you said,
about briefing her on what we do,

32:17.602 --> 32:19.437
if she's working with the FBI--

32:20.438 --> 32:22.607
"If" does me no good.

32:22.690 --> 32:24.150
I need confirmation.

32:24.233 --> 32:25.568
The best way to get it

32:25.652 --> 32:28.446
is by pretending to trust her
when I don't.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.491
[Park] Remind me what we're doing.

32:31.574 --> 32:34.702
We'll track Laghari
from her pickup point to Townsend.

32:34.786 --> 32:35.954
<i>Why are we doing that?</i>

32:36.037 --> 32:38.831
Can't Laghari just tell us his location
once she gets there?

32:38.915 --> 32:40.291
She's spying for us.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.876
[Ressler] <i>She's spying for Reddington.</i>

32:41.960 --> 32:43.503
In exchange for cooperating,

32:43.586 --> 32:45.880
Cooper got Reddington
to agree to let us follow her

32:45.964 --> 32:48.007
to where Townsend works or lives.

32:48.091 --> 32:50.093
[upbeat music playing]

32:51.803 --> 32:54.263
I have a 20. East side, heading north.

32:54.347 --> 32:56.182
Okay. Here we go.

32:56.265 --> 32:59.519
What about Keen? We're working with her
to find Reddington's handler.

32:59.602 --> 33:01.604
-Why can't she tell us?
-[Ressler] <i>I wish she would.</i>

33:01.688 --> 33:02.981
<i>But she won't until it's done.</i>

33:03.064 --> 33:03.940
[Aram] <i>What's done?</i>

33:04.023 --> 33:05.191
[Ressler] <i>I wish I knew.</i>

33:26.295 --> 33:28.297
[cell phone ringing]

33:37.098 --> 33:38.558
[Jax] <i>Blue van. By the curb.</i>

33:49.902 --> 33:53.114
We got a blue Chevy Astro van,
7th Street side.

34:04.917 --> 34:06.711
Where am I supposed to sit?

34:07.754 --> 34:08.838
You're not.

34:18.347 --> 34:19.515
Right this way.

34:23.811 --> 34:25.146
I got the tail.

34:26.689 --> 34:27.982
You got a signal?

34:28.066 --> 34:30.068
[Aram] Like taking candy from a kid.

34:30.151 --> 34:31.402
Not that I would.

34:31.486 --> 34:34.072
Except once, I had this mad craving
for a Butterfinger.

34:34.155 --> 34:36.657
<i>But, you know, it was Halloween,</i>

34:36.741 --> 34:38.284
<i>-and I was a kid too.</i>
-[cell phone rings]

34:39.368 --> 34:40.995
Tell me you're calling from Moscow.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.623
I am not. I don't know what's going on.

34:43.706 --> 34:46.334
Townsend sent me to do something.
It's like he knows.

34:46.417 --> 34:47.960
[Ressler] <i>What makes you think that?</i>

34:48.044 --> 34:50.588
[Liz] <i>The job, it's... make-work.</i>

34:50.671 --> 34:51.756
[Vandyke] It's a live call.

34:51.839 --> 34:55.134
<i>Something you give someone</i>
<i>to keep them from doing something else.</i>

34:55.218 --> 34:59.847
Okay. Agent Park, turning west
on Claiborne. You have eyes?

34:59.931 --> 35:01.390
[Park] <i>Copy. West on Claiborne.</i>

35:01.474 --> 35:02.934
So, what about Moscow?

35:04.060 --> 35:06.020
I was able to send someone.

35:06.604 --> 35:08.481
[Aram] Looks like they're stopping.

35:09.065 --> 35:10.608
<i>Keep your distance.</i>

35:10.691 --> 35:14.112
-[Ressler] <i>Any word on the extraction?</i>
-No. It shouldn't be a problem.

35:14.195 --> 35:16.906
If you're right and he suspects
we're working together...

35:16.989 --> 35:20.118
[Liz] <i>We're not working together.</i>
<i>We have the same goal.</i>

35:20.201 --> 35:23.246
<i>So does Townsend.</i>
<i>We're aligned against Reddington.</i>

35:23.329 --> 35:24.247
Maybe.

35:24.330 --> 35:26.499
But if Townsend knew
that we were even talking,

35:26.582 --> 35:28.543
<i>I doubt he'd be so understanding.</i>

35:28.626 --> 35:30.545
I'll call you as soon as I know.

35:31.254 --> 35:34.382
[Godwin] <i>You wanted confirmation.</i>
<i>You just got it.</i>

35:34.465 --> 35:35.424
She's not wrong.

35:35.508 --> 35:37.760
-We're all aligned against Reddington.
-Yeah.

35:37.844 --> 35:41.347
But based on that call I'd say
she and the feds are aligned against us.

35:41.430 --> 35:42.974
That's not what I heard.

35:43.057 --> 35:44.392
You weren't listening.

35:44.475 --> 35:46.769
You think you're giving her
rope to hang herself.

35:46.853 --> 35:49.313
I fear you've maybe given her
rope to hang all of us.

35:55.736 --> 35:57.071
This was easy.

36:00.199 --> 36:02.368
Or not. Her driver just left her.

36:02.952 --> 36:06.330
-Maybe there's another pickup.
-I don't think there is.

36:06.414 --> 36:08.416
[dramatic music playing]

36:18.009 --> 36:19.677
[Aram] <i>What's going on? Is she there?</i>

36:19.760 --> 36:20.595
[sighs]

36:20.678 --> 36:23.681
You were right.
It was like taking candy from a kid.

36:23.764 --> 36:25.349
Only we were the kids.

36:28.436 --> 36:30.438
[dramatic music playing]

36:31.063 --> 36:32.773
Priya Laghari.

36:32.857 --> 36:36.360
I feel as if
I'm in the presence of greatness.

36:36.444 --> 36:37.778
It's a fact. Not a feeling.

36:37.862 --> 36:41.949
May I kiss the ring,
which I assume was stolen at Cannes?

36:42.033 --> 36:43.117
St. Moritz.

36:43.201 --> 36:46.037
A trophy that once belonged
to a trophy wife.

36:46.120 --> 36:49.540
As touching as this is to watch,
I'm gonna go.

36:49.624 --> 36:51.334
Of course. Go, go-- Oh.

36:51.417 --> 36:54.754
Your appointment.
I hope you were able to reschedule it.

36:55.463 --> 36:57.590
Turned out not to be a problem.

36:57.673 --> 36:59.800
I was able to send someone in my place.

36:59.884 --> 37:01.469
-Were you?
-Yeah.

37:08.434 --> 37:09.977
Please tell me it's done.

37:10.061 --> 37:13.147
I'm meeting the team in ten.
It'll be done in 20.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.650
Sit tight. I got this.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.318
That's right. A hole.

37:17.401 --> 37:18.819
In the floor of the van?

37:18.903 --> 37:21.280
We don't know where or when she got out.

37:21.364 --> 37:23.199
So we're totally reliant on Reddington.

37:23.282 --> 37:25.952
Whatever Laghari finds out about Townsend,
she'll tell him.

37:26.035 --> 37:28.079
We're gonna trust he tells us?

37:28.162 --> 37:30.581
He might. Normally he wouldn't.

37:30.665 --> 37:33.876
Normally he's got an agenda
that we do not know about.

37:33.960 --> 37:36.462
But this time we want the same thing.

37:36.963 --> 37:37.838
I think.

37:37.922 --> 37:41.133
If we wanted the same thing,
Reddington wouldn't have let Obenrader go.

37:41.217 --> 37:42.635
[Park] If we'd arrested Obenrader,

37:42.718 --> 37:45.346
then it may have tipped Townsend
that Laghari's a plant.

37:45.429 --> 37:48.975
Maybe when this is all over,
Reddington will circle back to Obenrader.

37:49.058 --> 37:52.853
You know, I'll include your optimism
in my debrief to Cooper.

37:54.855 --> 37:58.401
Us and Mr. Reddington,
we're totally in sync on this, right?

37:58.484 --> 38:00.361
[dramatic music playing]

38:05.157 --> 38:06.534
[Raymond sighs]

38:07.326 --> 38:08.911
We'll hear when we hear.

38:09.662 --> 38:12.081
I know. But why haven't we heard?

38:13.666 --> 38:16.377
Camus thinks the world is meaningless,

38:16.460 --> 38:20.423
and that happiness comes from
accepting that nothing matters.

38:20.506 --> 38:21.841
He's an absurdist.

38:21.924 --> 38:25.177
And we live in a Theatre of the Absurd.

38:25.261 --> 38:28.389
Getting the FBI to believe
they helped us insert a spy

38:28.472 --> 38:31.600
when in fact
they helped us insert an assassin.

38:32.852 --> 38:35.479
I'm sure it's not jewels you're after.

38:35.563 --> 38:37.606
What is it you want me to steal?

38:37.690 --> 38:39.066
All of it.

38:40.359 --> 38:41.235
That's a lot.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.153
At any one time,

38:42.236 --> 38:46.365
our organization is tracking a variety
of vulnerable and defenseless assets.

38:46.449 --> 38:47.658
Contraband in transport.

38:47.742 --> 38:49.410
Exposed money-laundering sites.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.787
We don't discriminate.
We take when we can.

38:51.871 --> 38:53.414
What are we talking about?

38:53.497 --> 38:55.666
About putting you under contract.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.627
Paying you to identify items
that we might steal.

38:58.711 --> 39:01.505
Mr. Townsend.
I'm terribly sorry to interrupt,

39:01.589 --> 39:03.758
but it's a matter that can't wait.

39:03.841 --> 39:04.842
Excuse me.

39:08.846 --> 39:09.972
It's about Moscow.

39:15.978 --> 39:17.980
[men whispering indistinctly]

39:27.823 --> 39:30.993
Miss Laghari, it appears that
something has come up.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.119
If you'll excuse me.

39:39.877 --> 39:43.172
[grunting]

39:46.675 --> 39:48.677
-I heard from the Russia desk.
-What is it?

39:48.761 --> 39:49.804
Moscow's lighting up.

39:49.887 --> 39:54.016
Ivan Stepanov was abducted
from his apartment in the Pokrovsky Hills.

39:54.100 --> 39:56.018
-Keen.
-She must have gotten to him.

39:56.102 --> 39:57.228
She make contact?

39:57.311 --> 40:00.439
No. I left several messages,
but she hasn't picked up.

40:00.523 --> 40:01.899
Let's assume that's good.

40:01.982 --> 40:03.567
[Liz] <i>I thought you said it was done.</i>

40:03.651 --> 40:06.862
It was about to be. That's when
the place started swarming with cops.

40:06.946 --> 40:09.740
-I can't believe this.
<i>-Not just regular cops.</i>

40:09.824 --> 40:12.618
Someone rang a bell and there's
important-looking people here.

40:12.701 --> 40:13.661
<i>Get out of there.</i>

40:13.744 --> 40:16.205
You think this is the work
of your friends in the FBI?

40:16.288 --> 40:18.457
I have no idea what to think.

40:20.334 --> 40:21.377
[footsteps approaching]

40:23.170 --> 40:24.547
Is it done?

40:24.630 --> 40:26.757
I haven't heard from Laghari.

40:26.841 --> 40:28.759
But I just heard from Moscow.

40:31.011 --> 40:33.347
What? What happened?

40:34.807 --> 40:35.975
Our friend...

40:37.518 --> 40:39.061
he's been taken.

40:42.731 --> 40:44.733
[ominous music playing]

41:06.755 --> 41:08.048
[Townsend] Do you know who I am?

41:09.800 --> 41:11.427
Because I know who you are.

41:12.595 --> 41:15.764
You're the one who created the archive
that destroyed my family.

41:19.560 --> 41:22.897
I also know
you continue to feed intel to N-13.

41:23.564 --> 41:27.026
Katarina Rostova was N-13.

41:27.109 --> 41:30.321
And Katarina Rostova is dead.

41:31.071 --> 41:35.826
Yes, but Katarina Rostova was framed.

41:36.994 --> 41:39.997
Which means I dedicated my life
to the hatred of an innocent woman.

41:40.080 --> 41:41.916
But you know that.

41:41.999 --> 41:44.168
Just like I know
you're working with Reddington.

41:44.251 --> 41:45.878
What I don't know is why.

41:47.421 --> 41:49.965
Why you protect him. Why you help him.

41:50.049 --> 41:54.803
Why... my family had to die

41:54.887 --> 41:59.350
so that you could carry out
whatever plan you two are hatching.

42:02.811 --> 42:04.813
I have a lot of whys.

42:08.275 --> 42:12.279
Let's hope you're prepared
to offer some answers.

42:21.372 --> 42:23.374
