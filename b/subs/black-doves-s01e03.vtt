She says she has a job,
thinks you could be good for it.

01:10.625 --> 01:13.332
- Asked me if I thought you were reliable.
- What did you tell her?

01:13.333 --> 01:14.499
Same thing I'll tell you.

any questions about it.

27:00.166 --> 27:02.624
He's been there for Wallace
through thick and thin.

27:02.625 --> 27:04.666
Are you worried
I'm gonna shoot him or something?

27:08.708 --> 27:10.458
Our children go to school together.

27:10.958 --> 27:14.124
He'll be at the nativity this afternoon.

27:14.125 --> 27:15.208
Can I get to him?

27:15.958 --> 27:19.040
Well, I should imagine so, yes.
See if you can get him to talk.

27:19.041 --> 27:21.374
- And get me his phone.
- Okay.

27:21.375 --> 27:23.457
[suspenseful music continues]

27:23.458 --> 27:24.375
Look at this.

27:25.125 --> 27:27.625
- I found Kai-Ming.
- [Hector] <i>We need to get out of here! Go!</i>

27:28.333 --> 27:31.500
I'm pretty certain that she's being held
in a gang hideout in Peckham.

27:32.333 --> 27:33.374
Well, let's go and get her.

27:33.375 --> 27:35.457
- [Sam] It's too dangerous.
- We can handle it.

27:35.458 --> 27:36.582
No.

27:36.583 --> 27:37.750
- Sam...
- Helen.

27:39.083 --> 27:40.499
I was sent here to keep you alive,

27:40.500 --> 27:43.458
not drag you into
a series of escalating gunfights, okay?

27:44.250 --> 27:46.999
I have a plan.
I have a way in. I'm gonna sort it.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.249
But we'll do this my way, all right?

27:49.250 --> 27:51.333
[suspenseful music continues]

27:54.625 --> 27:56.165
- [Bill] Wal!
- [music fades]

27:56.166 --> 27:59.249
- What are you wearing tonight?
- What am I wearing? Nothing.

27:59.250 --> 28:02.124
I mean, house clothes.
What are you talking about?

28:02.125 --> 28:04.165
Department of Work and Pensions'
Christmas drinks.

28:04.166 --> 28:06.207
Yes, which I've mercifully
not been invited to.

28:06.208 --> 28:08.958
An egregious oversight
that's been rectified. You're going.

28:09.625 --> 28:11.374
You know I'm the defence secretary?
You know?

28:11.375 --> 28:12.999
The Chinese have reached out.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.582
- They want a meeting.
- With me?

28:15.583 --> 28:17.790
Yes. They don't want anyone to know
they want a meeting.

28:17.791 --> 28:20.832
So we have to find somewhere
where <i>conceivably</i> the defence secretary

28:20.833 --> 28:23.165
could bump into envoys
from the Chinese government.

28:23.166 --> 28:26.249
The Work and Pensions' Christmas drinks
was the first thing you thought of?

28:26.250 --> 28:28.957
- It's the best we had at short notice.
- It would have to have been.

28:28.958 --> 28:31.249
I'm making the department go.
Bring the wife, make a show.

28:31.250 --> 28:34.125
A five-minute powwow in the side room
and then you can leave.

28:35.125 --> 28:36.750
Do we know what they wanna talk about?

28:37.750 --> 28:41.541
Well, uh, let's assume
it's their dead ambassador.

28:42.041 --> 28:45.207
Then if it's just whether Arsenal are
gonna qualify for the Champions League,

28:45.208 --> 28:47.083
that can be a nice surprise for all of us.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.291
I'll have a car pick you up.

28:50.375 --> 28:51.208

I better take this. I'll be two minutes.

all these slow bastards

29:07.333 --> 29:08.790

29:16.625 --> 29:18.291

29:18.791 --> 29:19.708
No?

29:20.333 --> 29:21.249
Okay.

29:21.250 --> 29:22.541

29:23.375 --> 29:24.583

29:30.166 --> 29:31.041

on their journey, eager to meet...

29:57.750 --> 29:59.790
[Sam] What was on that recording
Phillip Bray had?

29:59.791 --> 30:01.957
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- [Sam] You do.

30:01.958 --> 30:04.290
He had something on you,
you found out, and now he's dead.

30:04.291 --> 30:05.624
That was nothing to do with me.

30:05.625 --> 30:07.582
- It was something to do with China.
- No.

30:07.583 --> 30:11.707
Note the lack... of rising inflection
at the end of the sentence.

30:11.708 --> 30:14.374
That wasn't a question. He was onto you
about something you'd done.

30:14.375 --> 30:16.374
It involved the ambassador.
It got him killed.

30:16.375 --> 30:20.499
What was on that recording, Stephen?
What is it that everyone's looking for?

for a place to stay...</i>

30:22.333 --> 30:26.707
By the way, there's a thing tonight.
We have to go to it. Um, Christmas drinks.

30:26.708 --> 30:28.333
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

30:29.291 --> 30:31.332
It's just a stupid meeting.
It's the Chinese.

30:31.333 --> 30:33.541
All very cloak-and-daggers,
but it'll be quite quick.

30:35.041 --> 30:37.750

saved as "Repair Shop" in your phone.

30:50.458 --> 30:55.040
And, oh... [chuckles] ...look, a message
to them at 5:00 a.m. on 13th December.

30:55.041 --> 30:57.624
That was the night that Ambassador Chen
was killed, wasn't it?

30:57.625 --> 30:59.166
Let's see what it says.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.499
"It's done." What was done, Stephen?

31:03.500 --> 31:05.415
Chen? I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:05.416 --> 31:07.624
I'm talking about murders.

31:07.625 --> 31:09.749
Professional ones. Expensive ones.

31:09.750 --> 31:12.832
Ambassador Chen, Phillip Bray,
Maggie Jones, Jason Davies.

31:12.833 --> 31:16.000
You know who killed them.
Don't pretend you don't.

31:17.500 --> 31:20.624
Why don't I ask Repair Shop?
Shall I ring him now?

31:20.625 --> 31:22.790
No. No, don't. [groans]

31:22.791 --> 31:25.832
I'm gonna go through every number,
contact, message on this phone.

31:25.833 --> 31:29.665
I'm gonna find out all your secrets.
And they are not going to stay secrets.

31:29.666 --> 31:31.790
[Stephen] Stop. Just stop.

31:31.791 --> 31:32.875
Okay?

31:34.791 --> 31:37.665
Walk away. You don't know
what you're dealing with.

31:37.666 --> 31:40.750
[Sam] Then enlighten me.
What is it you're involved in?

31:41.958 --> 31:44.041
This isn't gonna go away, Stephen.

31:44.916 --> 31:47.625

Right, so you let him live... so you could
come and kill him seven years later?

kill my ex-boyfriend if I don't.

I got 200 quid to cut the brakes
of my cousin's boyfriend's car.

35:16.750 --> 35:19.790
He crashed into an Esso station.
Could hear the explosion in Bridgend.

in here tonight that needs help,

35:25.833 --> 35:28.541

we all die in the process, yeah?

38:38.583 --> 38:40.666
[tense music builds]

38:42.291 --> 38:43.666
[Stephen whimpers]

38:44.791 --> 38:47.916
- [Wallace] What's the mood like?
- [inhales sharply] It's frosty.

38:50.541 --> 38:51.583
You, leave.

38:53.166 --> 38:54.790
Chang Hao, Chinese envoy.

38:54.791 --> 38:55.750
Mr. Webb.

38:56.375 --> 38:58.082
- You all right?
- This is Wu Lin.

38:58.083 --> 38:59.040
All right?

38:59.041 --> 39:02.083
Mr. Wu has been investigating
the murder of Ambassador Chen.

39:02.791 --> 39:04.832
An unauthorized investigation, hm?

39:04.833 --> 39:07.790
Without the permission
or assistance of the Metropolitan Police.

39:07.791 --> 39:11.332
In this case, it's not been possible
to collaborate with your police force.

39:11.333 --> 39:12.374
And why's that?

39:12.375 --> 39:15.457
Because we believe them
to be complicit in the crime.

39:15.458 --> 39:16.791
Do you? Complicit?

39:17.708 --> 39:18.999
I'm afraid, in this country,

39:19.000 --> 39:21.207
we have a few more checks and balances
with our coppers

39:21.208 --> 39:24.083
than you might be used to
back home, gentlemen.

39:25.500 --> 39:26.332
What's this?

39:26.333 --> 39:28.082
Kai-Ming Chen's flat,

39:28.083 --> 39:31.499
one hour before the body of our ambassador
was found inside.

39:31.500 --> 39:34.290
The man you can see fleeing
is Cole Atwood.

39:34.291 --> 39:35.749
Kai-Ming's boyfriend

39:35.750 --> 39:37.790
and CIA agent.

39:37.791 --> 39:39.415
[Chang Hao] By checking CCTV,

39:39.416 --> 39:41.457
we were able to trace
Cole Atwood's journey

39:41.458 --> 39:44.582
from the murder scene all the way back
to the American embassy.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.625
We have not as yet seen him leave.

39:48.208 --> 39:50.290
So much security camera footage.

39:50.291 --> 39:53.082
Except when Mr. Lin
tried to find recordings

39:53.083 --> 39:56.250
taken around Kai-Ming's apartment
when the killing took place,

39:56.833 --> 39:58.207
none exists.

39:58.208 --> 40:03.415
As if someone had wiped out all evidence
of what <i>really</i> happened in that apartment.

40:03.416 --> 40:04.624
[message alert chimes]

40:04.625 --> 40:05.874
[tense music plays]

40:05.875 --> 40:10.791
[groaning on video]

40:12.541 --> 40:16.290
[Chang Hao] Mr. Webb, our ambassador
is dead. His daughter is missing.

40:16.291 --> 40:19.165
Your closest ally just committed
an act of war upon us.

40:19.166 --> 40:21.332
And your government is complicit
in covering it up.

40:21.333 --> 40:23.708
I'm afraid this doesn't
prove anything, gentlemen.

40:24.333 --> 40:28.874
The proof will come.
Ask the Americans if Cole Atwood is CIA.

40:28.875 --> 40:31.957
And then tell me if you think that
they are lying to you when they deny it.

40:31.958 --> 40:33.290
Why are you bringing this to me?

40:33.291 --> 40:35.582
There are a number of proposals
from our government

40:35.583 --> 40:40.290
to various British companies
concerning Category 1 military contracts.

40:40.291 --> 40:44.791
So far, these proposals have been denied.
We are keen to have them reevaluated.

40:45.375 --> 40:47.790
We don't do that kind of business
with you, and you know it.

40:47.791 --> 40:49.915
We are offering you
the opportunity to avoid

40:49.916 --> 40:52.375
a catastrophic escalation of violence.

40:52.875 --> 40:54.999
We suggest you give
due consideration to it,

40:55.000 --> 40:56.749
uh, and to the alternative.

40:56.750 --> 40:57.708
[Wallace scoffs]

40:58.708 --> 41:00.333
[tense music continues]

41:09.791 --> 41:12.041
[quietly] Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

41:12.791 --> 41:15.458
[Stephen groaning on video]

41:16.583 --> 41:17.791
[tense music builds]

41:22.875 --> 41:23.707
Vodka.

41:23.708 --> 41:25.083
[upbeat music plays]

41:27.916 --> 41:29.875
- [sighs]
- Is everything okay?

41:31.125 --> 41:33.208
- [chuckles]
- Was that vodka? Love that.

41:34.375 --> 41:35.707
Hey, we need to, uh, leave.

41:35.708 --> 41:38.457
- Oh, so soon?
- Yeah, I've been pulled into a meeting.

41:38.458 --> 41:41.665
No rest for the wicked.
It was so nice to meet you, Helen.

41:41.666 --> 41:45.207
Sorry you're dragged away from the fun.
Looked like you were just getting started.

41:45.208 --> 41:47.082
Don't be. If I'm lucky,
I'll beat the traffic,

41:47.083 --> 41:49.082
be in my pajamas,
watching telly within the hour.

41:49.083 --> 41:51.375
Ah, well, a door closes, a window opens.

41:55.333 --> 41:56.291
I suppose it does.

41:57.333 --> 41:59.333
[suspenseful music plays]

42:23.958 --> 42:25.249
[music stops]

42:25.250 --> 42:26.374
I want out.

42:26.375 --> 42:27.332
[Reed] Oh, Helen.

42:27.333 --> 42:30.750
Oh, please don't try and persuade me
to stay. It won't work.

42:31.250 --> 42:34.540
We'd just waste both of our times,
and I have to piss every 15 minutes,

42:34.541 --> 42:36.958
so we're really rather on the clock here.

42:37.500 --> 42:39.541
- Why now?
- [Helen] The babies.

42:41.583 --> 42:44.374
- Can't let them become a part of this.
- [Reed] What about Wallace?

42:44.375 --> 42:47.415
- I hate the idea of hurting him.
- [Reed] Why are you trying to leave him?

42:47.416 --> 42:49.500
I'm not trying to leave him.
I'm trying to leave you.

42:50.166 --> 42:51.290
Well, you'd have to go away.

42:51.291 --> 42:53.874
You can't be a loose end
hanging around here.

42:53.875 --> 42:54.832
I have a place.

42:54.833 --> 42:56.499
- [Reed] Is it far?
- You won't find it.

42:56.500 --> 42:58.416
Only if I'm not looking.

43:00.291 --> 43:01.707
Well, it's your decision, of course.

43:01.708 --> 43:03.999
We can probably
get someone else in fairly easily.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.124
He'll be vulnerable
right after you've gone.

43:06.125 --> 43:07.624
Get someone else in?

43:07.625 --> 43:10.750
[Reed] What, you think he's not gonna
meet someone else if you leave?

43:11.375 --> 43:15.707
He's not Miss fucking Havisham, Helen.
We'll get a new girl in, new relationship.

43:15.708 --> 43:19.082
Wallace is someone we've identified
as a potential long-term tap.

43:19.083 --> 43:21.415
So, yes, we'll get someone else in.

43:21.416 --> 43:25.540
A door closes, a window opens,
as I always say.

43:25.541 --> 43:28.000
[suspenseful, pulsing music plays]

43:51.708 --> 43:52.540
Hey!

43:52.541 --> 43:53.458
[Sam] Helen.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.832
- [Helen] <i>It's so good to hear from you.</i>
- How pregnant are you?

43:56.833 --> 43:57.916
[car doors close]

43:58.458 --> 43:59.790
[Helen] Sam, what's going on?

43:59.791 --> 44:01.083
I'm compromised.

44:01.791 --> 44:03.958
So... Um, I'm fucked, I mean.

44:04.625 --> 44:07.416
They're here. Michael's here.
I need you to get him out.

44:08.125 --> 44:09.540
I'm coming. Hold on.

44:09.541 --> 44:11.291
[Sam] <i>Helen, it's gonna be bad.</i>

44:13.708 --> 44:14.624
I will be there.

44:14.625 --> 44:16.708
[somber music plays]

44:24.333 --> 44:26.540
- Sam, what's happening?
- [Sam] You need to get dressed.

44:26.541 --> 44:28.415
- What the hell is going on?
- Get dressed.

44:28.416 --> 44:29.915
- No, Sam.
- Fucking put them on!

44:29.916 --> 44:31.082
You have to talk to me.

44:31.083 --> 44:33.082
Who were those men?
Why did they attack us?

44:33.083 --> 44:34.457
- They didn't attack us.
- No--

44:34.458 --> 44:35.541
They attacked me.

44:36.041 --> 44:38.207
Now, listen. Listen to me now.

44:38.208 --> 44:40.582
It's okay. You're gonna be fine.
You need to get dressed.

44:40.583 --> 44:42.416
Nothing else matters now. Put them on.

44:44.083 --> 44:45.082
Come on.

44:45.083 --> 44:47.665
We're gonna go out now,
and you're gonna stay behind me, okay?

44:47.666 --> 44:49.374
- You understand?
- Sam...

44:49.375 --> 44:51.624
Now, close your eyes. Hold onto me.

44:51.625 --> 44:54.207
Move when I tell you to move.
Stop when I tell you to stop, okay?

44:54.208 --> 44:55.915

45:06.000 --> 45:06.958
Come.

45:08.041 --> 45:09.958
Stay low. There are stairs here.

45:10.791 --> 45:11.750
Now, down.

45:12.708 --> 45:13.541
And another.

45:16.916 --> 45:17.750
Stay low.

45:19.250 --> 45:20.458
- Hold onto me.
- Yeah.

- [Michael] Yeah.

More stairs.

Okay. Keep down. Keep back.

Right.

[Helen] <i>I need an exit strategy for Sam,
and his partner needs protection.</i>

Well, you know, Helen,
something like that is expensive.

48:33.708 --> 48:34.875
It's a lot of work.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.458
It's a service
I can't just provide to anyone.

48:39.583 --> 48:42.208
I'll stay. I won't leave.
Forget what I said earlier.

48:44.750 --> 48:47.500
I need to know that you're reliable,
that I can trust you.

[Helen] <i>You can. I promise.</i>

48:51.333 --> 48:53.291
It makes me happy to hear you say that.

I'll make some calls
and talk to you on Monday.

48:57.083 --> 48:59.083
<i>Sam's lucky to have you as a friend.</i>

49:04.958 --> 49:07.249
Tell your friends he had a breakdown
and he had to leave.

49:07.250 --> 49:10.624
Uh, tell them you were heartbroken,
and you... you went away for a while.

49:10.625 --> 49:13.499
You stayed with your parents.
A woman named Reed will call.

49:13.500 --> 49:17.207
Follow her instructions.
Forget today. Do you understand?

49:17.208 --> 49:21.165
Never ever tell anyone what happened.
I cannot guarantee your safety if you do.

49:21.166 --> 49:23.250

She loves all that.
