22:48.076 --> 22:49.494
given our tight deadline.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.537
Much ado about nothing then.

22:51.537 --> 22:52.789
Seems so.

22:52.789 --> 22:54.707
That said, it couldn't hurt

22:54.707 --> 22:57.293
to have my MI6 counterparts
do some digging.

22:57.293 --> 22:58.753
Of course.

22:58.753 --> 23:00.129
I'll let you know what, if anything,

23:00.129 --> 23:02.298
we discover about Officer Sutton.

23:02.298 --> 23:04.258
- [dog barking]
- [door opens]

23:05.635 --> 23:07.637
[tense music playing]

23:14.477 --> 23:17.271
[Heinrich] Raymond Reddington.
It's been such a long time.

23:17.271 --> 23:19.440
I thought I'd never hear from you again.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.734
You won't. Not after today.

23:21.734 --> 23:22.819
[both speaking German]

23:22.819 --> 23:25.029
Get the round ones,
with the jelly in the middle.

23:25.321 --> 23:26.322
Okay.

23:26.656 --> 23:28.282
Anything for the dog?

23:28.741 --> 23:29.742
[Heinrich] Like what?

23:30.159 --> 23:32.328
[Liesl] I don't know, a biscuit?

23:32.453 --> 23:33.788
[Heinrich] Whatever.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.873
But hurry back, dear,

23:35.873 --> 23:38.000
the medication is going to
start to take effect quickly...

23:38.626 --> 23:40.086
[fingers snapping]

23:40.086 --> 23:42.004
[in English] If it hasn't already.

23:47.301 --> 23:48.344
So, Raymond,

23:48.344 --> 23:51.222
it's not like you
to travel with a side dish.

23:51.222 --> 23:53.474
Raymond, who is this sublime specimen?

23:53.474 --> 23:55.101
[Reddington] Never mind who she is.

23:55.101 --> 23:56.769
Do you have what I came for?

23:56.769 --> 23:58.479
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

23:59.772 --> 24:00.982
[drawer slides]

24:06.112 --> 24:07.822
On second thought,

24:07.822 --> 24:10.533
perhaps I accept her instead,
if that suits?

24:10.533 --> 24:12.869
- [Reddington] It doesn't.
- [Heinrich] What a shame.

24:12.869 --> 24:14.704
I would kill to get my hands
on that bone structure.

24:14.704 --> 24:15.830
Careful.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.213
We have to get back
to New York now.

24:24.422 --> 24:26.257
[dog continues barking]

24:26.257 --> 24:27.592
Heinrich, when I leave here,

24:27.592 --> 24:28.968
I'm going to give Freddy a call,

24:28.968 --> 24:30.970
and he's gonna come by
and get that dog.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.930
It should be in a proper home.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.808
I'm sure Freddy
will be here within the hour.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.895
And if you or the dog
aren't here at that time,

24:38.895 --> 24:40.521
Freddy will go to the house

24:40.521 --> 24:42.356
and sit with your mother
until you return.

24:42.356 --> 24:46.110
Now, considering there is nothing on Earth

24:46.110 --> 24:47.695
badder than Freddy,

24:47.695 --> 24:50.323
certainly not you,
and not that poor dog,

24:50.323 --> 24:53.618
not even your miserable, horrible mother.

24:53.618 --> 24:55.286
Heinrich,

24:55.286 --> 24:57.580
please, please,

24:58.748 --> 25:01.042
don't make Freddy lose his patience.

25:01.042 --> 25:02.585
Don't worry about me.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.713
Though I can't speak for my mother.

25:06.464 --> 25:08.591
[tense music playing]

25:10.760 --> 25:12.345
[dog barking]

25:16.724 --> 25:18.226
[door closes]

25:18.226 --> 25:21.979
All right. Ah! Look!
First customer of the day.

25:21.979 --> 25:23.064
Welcome!

25:23.898 --> 25:26.025
Is there anything in particular
you're looking for?

25:26.025 --> 25:27.568
- I love that lamp!
- [laughs]

25:27.568 --> 25:30.112
My Gran had one just like it!

25:30.655 --> 25:31.739
Is it expensive?

25:31.739 --> 25:33.282
Make me an offer.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.411
I can do $75 if it's cash,

25:37.411 --> 25:41.040
or, at most, $125 if it's a check.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.541
Hmm. [inhales sharply]

25:42.541 --> 25:44.168
I don't think I can let it go at that,

25:44.168 --> 25:46.003
especially this early in the day.

25:46.003 --> 25:49.090
Can you bring it up a little,
say, another hundred bucks?

25:49.548 --> 25:51.592
[woman] That's a lot of money
for a table lamp.

25:51.592 --> 25:54.971
I'm just looking for a little
extra light in my crafting room.

25:54.971 --> 25:56.764
This lamp would be perfect for that.

25:56.764 --> 25:59.642
Yeah, but I could get a really nice,
practical one

25:59.642 --> 26:01.936
at Cost Cutters
for a quarter of the price.

26:01.936 --> 26:03.271
Right.

26:03.271 --> 26:04.563
Not stained glass, though.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.023
[woman] Well, yeah.

26:06.023 --> 26:07.650
Probably not. Yeah.

26:08.150 --> 26:09.402
And it works, right?

26:14.740 --> 26:16.075
Um. Hmm.

26:16.909 --> 26:21.205
- Will you do... $200?
- Sold.

26:21.330 --> 26:22.790
[chuckles excitedly]

26:22.790 --> 26:26.294
- Can I pick it up at the end of the day?
- Absolutely.

26:30.006 --> 26:31.173
Happy crafting!

26:35.970 --> 26:38.139
[door opens and closes]

26:38.139 --> 26:41.100
You just sold
an authentic Tiffany lamp for $200?

26:41.100 --> 26:42.310
I did.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.273
Even $20,000 is a steal.

26:47.273 --> 26:49.358
Why didn't you tell her what it is?

26:49.358 --> 26:51.527
Maybe she'll discover it on her own.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.446
Imagine her delight then.

26:53.446 --> 26:56.490
The story she'll tell
for the rest of her life

26:56.490 --> 26:59.076
about finding a Tiffany lamp

26:59.076 --> 27:02.621
in some dusty garage sale
in Bushwick,

27:02.621 --> 27:04.874
snagging it for a song.

27:04.874 --> 27:08.377
Yeah, but what if she never
learns where it came from?

27:08.377 --> 27:09.837
Its true provenance?

27:10.546 --> 27:11.672
What if...

27:15.176 --> 27:17.053
[people chattering indistinctly]

27:17.053 --> 27:18.137
[clears throat]

27:20.389 --> 27:21.724
Senator Dorf.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.226
Ah. Congressman...

27:24.226 --> 27:26.103
- Hudson, sir.
- Right, right.

27:26.103 --> 27:29.273
Are you meeting someone
here for lunch, Hudson?

27:29.273 --> 27:31.984
This place is well off the beaten path.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.445
I mean, it's private.
I'm surprised you even know it.

27:34.445 --> 27:36.822
[laughs] I did my research.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.407
I was hoping to have a quick word

27:38.407 --> 27:40.159
on a matter of some importance.

27:40.159 --> 27:43.079
It's about FBI Task Force number 836.

27:43.079 --> 27:44.163
May I sit?

27:44.163 --> 27:46.123
I sure wish you wouldn't.

27:48.959 --> 27:51.212
This Task Force
is burning through budget,

27:51.212 --> 27:54.673
but I... I can't seem to find
anybody who knows anything about it.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.635
Who's on it, what they're doing,
what their practices are.

27:57.635 --> 27:59.470
I mean, are you familiar with it?

27:59.470 --> 28:00.971
I don't know, Hudson.

28:00.971 --> 28:04.558
I mean, I trust the FBI knows what
they need better than you or I do.

28:04.558 --> 28:07.853
I mean, people don't give
a pig's poke about budgets.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.980
People care about safety.

28:09.980 --> 28:12.191
And they're happy to pay for

28:12.191 --> 28:15.653
the perception of being kept safe,
whether they realize it not.

28:15.653 --> 28:17.947
Oh, I believe the taxpayer would care.

28:17.947 --> 28:19.573
It's not part of ATF, DEA.

28:19.573 --> 28:21.951
Their numbers are astronomical
and only getting bigger.

28:21.951 --> 28:23.869
Frankly, I'd like to find out

28:23.869 --> 28:25.830
what the hell we're paying for, sir.

28:27.456 --> 28:28.916
Are you married, Hudson?

28:28.916 --> 28:30.835
- Mmm.
- Well, I am.

28:31.502 --> 28:34.713
And on advice of my wife,
I don't sweat the small stuff.

28:34.713 --> 28:37.758
And this sounds to me
to be very, very small.

28:37.758 --> 28:39.510
So if you feel you must,

28:39.510 --> 28:41.262
set up something with my office,

28:41.262 --> 28:42.430
and we'll talk about it then.

28:42.430 --> 28:45.182
But right now,
I need to get back to this bulgogi

28:45.182 --> 28:46.559
before it goes cold.

28:46.559 --> 28:48.519
I've tried your office.
You're booked pretty tight.

28:49.437 --> 28:52.022
Look, nobody wins when power's
abused in the shadows.

28:52.022 --> 28:53.524
Good Lord. I--

28:53.524 --> 28:55.734
Why don't we just cut the crap?

28:55.734 --> 28:58.112
Okay, what you're really after
are headlines.

28:58.112 --> 29:00.656
You want me to help you
make a lot of noise

29:00.656 --> 29:02.825
about diddly-squat in a hearing

29:02.825 --> 29:04.118
so that you can suddenly come in

29:04.118 --> 29:06.662
and be the Boy Scout
who rescues the Republic.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.706
I can assure you
this isn't about optics, sir.

29:08.706 --> 29:10.124
It's purely accountability I'm after.

29:10.124 --> 29:11.208
Well, haven't you heard?

29:11.208 --> 29:13.335
Accountability went out
with the Macarena.

29:14.003 --> 29:15.921
Aren't you even a little curious

29:15.921 --> 29:18.174
about where all that money
is going, Senator?

29:18.174 --> 29:19.383
Huh?

29:22.761 --> 29:24.555
[Herbie] <i>Where in the world
are you now?</i>

29:24.555 --> 29:28.684
Watching Reddington unload
centuries of invaluable history

29:28.684 --> 29:32.021
at his own personal Antiques Roadshow.

29:32.021 --> 29:33.397
Just promise me you'll tell me

29:33.397 --> 29:35.399
if he's selling
a Rocket-Firing Boba Fett.

29:35.399 --> 29:37.151
[whimsical music playing]

29:38.736 --> 29:40.404
It's not that kind of garage sale.

29:41.238 --> 29:43.574
<i>Cooper sends me
to keep tabs on Reddington,</i>

29:43.574 --> 29:44.909
and what happens?

29:44.909 --> 29:47.536
I find myself on an impromptu world tour,

29:47.536 --> 29:50.206
intersecting with some
truly dodgy characters.

29:50.206 --> 29:52.791
<i>Have you ever heard
of Heinrich Wittelsbach?</i>

29:52.791 --> 29:54.710
Mmm, no.
What did Red want with him?

29:54.710 --> 29:57.505
No clue.
They swapped envelopes.

29:57.505 --> 30:00.174
Well, I know Red wouldn't
involve some dodgy guy

30:00.174 --> 30:01.675
unless there was a good reason.

30:01.675 --> 30:04.595
And, as for you,
you're doing the best you can.

30:04.595 --> 30:06.388
You're supposed to stick with him,
and you are.

30:06.388 --> 30:08.516
What happens while you do
is no fault of yours.

30:08.516 --> 30:10.893
<i>Anyway, got to go.
See ya, Siya.</i>

30:13.854 --> 30:15.856
[tense music playing]

30:23.113 --> 30:25.574
Hard to believe a guy like that
likes foot massages.

30:25.574 --> 30:27.618
Everybody likes foot massages, Nige.

30:27.618 --> 30:28.744
[chuckles]

30:32.248 --> 30:34.041
I'll be on comms.

30:34.041 --> 30:35.834
Anything happens,
I'll send up the usual flare.

30:35.834 --> 30:36.919
You do the same.

30:40.464 --> 30:41.799
[car door closes]

30:55.020 --> 30:59.149
Thirty. And there's the five.

31:00.234 --> 31:01.360
Enjoy.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.362
[chattering indistinctly]

31:04.572 --> 31:08.325
Excuse me, sir.
I was told to say that Ms. Mallet sent me.

31:08.325 --> 31:10.786
Yes! I...

31:10.786 --> 31:12.997
I have something

31:12.997 --> 31:15.583
I believe you're looking for.

31:15.583 --> 31:16.667
Oh.

31:18.627 --> 31:19.712
Oh.

31:21.088 --> 31:23.048
"The Sicilian Error of Color."

31:23.048 --> 31:24.341
[chuckles]

31:24.341 --> 31:27.344
[chuckling] I almost
can't believe my eyes.

31:28.304 --> 31:31.140
You know, I was stunned
when my collector friend

31:31.140 --> 31:33.851
called to tell me
the stamp had surfaced.

31:33.851 --> 31:36.270
Here it is before my very eyes.

31:36.270 --> 31:39.064
One of only two in the world.

31:40.232 --> 31:44.111
Imagine the Italian printer, 1859,

31:44.111 --> 31:46.572
who runs off a couple
of postage stamps

31:46.572 --> 31:51.869
in blue ink instead of orange,
and, boom, 160-something years later,

31:51.869 --> 31:54.955
one of the most lucrative
printing errors in history.

31:54.955 --> 31:56.040
Yeah.

31:56.040 --> 32:00.753
Oh, my husband was obsessed
with this stamp.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.130
It was his white whale.

32:03.130 --> 32:05.382
Or I suppose his blue whale.

32:05.382 --> 32:06.925
[both laugh]

32:06.925 --> 32:08.344
God rest his soul.

32:09.053 --> 32:10.638
I'm sorry for your loss.

32:10.638 --> 32:12.765
Oh, it was a while back now,

32:12.765 --> 32:16.852
but it still feels like
yesterday that I lost him.

32:18.312 --> 32:19.521
My husband always said

32:19.521 --> 32:22.274
that stamps were humble and everyday

32:23.025 --> 32:27.196
but then also
these tiny works of art

32:27.196 --> 32:28.697
that could last forever.

32:30.824 --> 32:32.159
Kind of like marriages.

32:34.578 --> 32:36.747
Oh. Forgive me.

32:36.747 --> 32:38.624
You didn't ask to hear our life story.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.751
Not at all. Not at all.

32:40.751 --> 32:42.252
Anyway, I, uh...

32:42.252 --> 32:44.797
I know I can't afford
what this stamp is worth.

32:45.923 --> 32:48.258
I just really wanted to see it in person

32:48.258 --> 32:49.885
after all this time.

32:51.345 --> 32:54.348
Oh. Perhaps I could take a photo of it?

32:54.348 --> 32:57.518
Oh, no, you should have more
than a photograph of this.

32:59.103 --> 33:00.813
I'm prepared to offer it to you

33:00.813 --> 33:02.856
for a fraction of what it's worth.

33:02.856 --> 33:04.316
Oh, no, don't.

33:04.316 --> 33:07.236
I couldn't even afford
a fraction of a fraction.

33:08.153 --> 33:10.614
Could you afford, say, two?

33:10.614 --> 33:12.741
Two million? Ha! No.

33:13.617 --> 33:15.327
How about $2,000?

33:18.539 --> 33:19.998
Last time it transacted,

33:19.998 --> 33:23.711
this stamp went for over
a thousand times that.

33:23.711 --> 33:24.837
It did.

33:25.504 --> 33:28.340
Well, I can't imagine anybody else

33:28.340 --> 33:31.301
appreciating this stamp more than you.

33:33.095 --> 33:34.179
Buy it.

What a wonderful,

35:55.404 --> 35:58.156
Agnes and I have a date with

35:58.156 --> 35:59.283
And while we're in New York,

it only made sense to stop by
and pay you a visit.

Hi.

This has to do
with your history as a Naval officer.

had returned unexpectedly.

40:11.159 --> 40:14.830

he could handle it.
