01:05:46.484 --> 01:05:47.485
What do you mean--

01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:49.779
I heard your fishies are
making you some good money.

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:51.072
High demand.

01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:53.950
Stop operating independently.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.285
Our ring can help you with distribution.

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:00.456
[Velcro ripping]

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:02.333
You're not answering me.

01:06:03.584 --> 01:06:06.587
I don't need the ring's help.
I've been running it on my own.

01:06:07.129 --> 01:06:09.966
If you give me your permission,
I can take care of it.

01:06:20.851 --> 01:06:22.061
All right, get lost.

01:06:28.275 --> 01:06:29.193
Who is that?

01:06:31.696 --> 01:06:33.739
What a mess. An absolute mess, eh?

01:06:33.739 --> 01:06:35.408
Is this an orphanage?

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.327
It's not. Leave her up to me, sir.

01:06:38.327 --> 01:06:40.371
And what exactly will you do with her?

01:06:40.371 --> 01:06:43.457
- She's young. We don't have to--
- You said she saw you murder that girl.

01:06:43.457 --> 01:06:45.209
Doesn't that make her a witness?

01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:47.586
It does.

01:06:48.087 --> 01:06:48.921
"It does"?

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:54.635
I'll make sure that she doesn't speak.

01:06:54.635 --> 01:06:56.387
[laughing] Oh man.

01:06:57.930 --> 01:07:00.141
It's hard to believe
a little pussy like you

01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:02.476
walks around
with a dick in his pants. Hmm?

01:07:02.476 --> 01:07:03.519
Seriously.

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:08.190
I don't know anymore.

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:11.027
You're an enigma, friend.

01:07:14.572 --> 01:07:17.700

[man] You like that?

01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:33.215
Feels good, huh?

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:36.052
It's a shame
the water pressure's a little bit weak.

01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:38.429
Wanna shower together, hmm?

01:07:39.263 --> 01:07:41.807
It's so refreshing. I'm kind of sweaty.

01:07:42.683 --> 01:07:44.393
Doesn't that feel so good?

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:46.103
Oh, I bet it feels so good.

01:07:46.103 --> 01:07:48.314
Just so you know, I'm disappointed.

01:07:50.983 --> 01:07:53.360
I was always kind to you.
I treated you special,

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:54.820
unlike the other girls

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:59.325
I thought we really had something,
I don't know, precious, me and you.

01:08:00.117 --> 01:08:01.744
Do you remember what I told you?

01:08:02.328 --> 01:08:05.539
I told you to stick it out a bit longer
and it'd be over soon.

01:08:08.042 --> 01:08:09.293
Then you fucked it up.

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:11.128
Huh?

01:08:12.546 --> 01:08:13.380
[Choi sighs]

01:08:16.884 --> 01:08:19.929
Did being a sidekick for that bitch
make you feel badass?

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:22.014
Did it make you feel like you mattered?

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:24.767
Oh yeah?

01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:26.560
You're looking at me?

01:08:27.186 --> 01:08:28.646
Lower your head.

01:08:28.646 --> 01:08:32.024
You little brat, how dare you?
The adults are talking right now.

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:35.861
My god. That sneaky bitch
really messed with this girl's head.

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:40.199
It's better for you if you open your mouth
and tell us where she is,

01:08:40.199 --> 01:08:41.951
you stupid little fucking brat.

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:01.137
[groans]

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.601
Turn around
and put your hands on the wall.

01:09:09.854 --> 01:09:13.232
We're going to start all over again
with you today, understand?

All our girls are young.

01:09:23.701 --> 01:09:24.702
No.

01:09:25.202 --> 01:09:27.079
We only have young girls, sir. Yeah.

01:09:28.914 --> 01:09:29.915
Ah, I see.

01:09:32.418 --> 01:09:34.336
Yeah, but you don't have to worry.

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:37.256
We have an agreement
with the local police officials, so...

01:09:37.882 --> 01:09:39.133
- Yeah, yeah.

Of course, sir.

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:47.558
We're members only.
We're not like a brothel in Seoul, sir.

01:09:48.726 --> 01:09:49.727
- Right.

Feel free to drop by
anytime you want. Weekdays, weekend.

01:09:58.485 --> 01:09:59.904

[snickers]

01:14:34.094 --> 01:14:36.430
If you tell me where she is
without running your mouths

01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:38.140
and asking me any questions...

01:14:38.724 --> 01:14:39.725

can tell me where she is?

in Bugaksan, damn it.

for you to fight with us, is there?

Was that woman really a ballerina?

I mean, what ballerina is fat?

01:24:21.473 --> 01:24:23.224

If you kill me, you better watch out.

01:24:48.291 --> 01:24:49.793
When I see that bitch in hell,

01:24:49.793 --> 01:24:52.378
I'm gonna keep doing
the same things to her.

01:24:53.296 --> 01:24:54.214
You want that?

01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:18.071
Try me.

01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:22.158
Because you'll be my prey in hell.

Nobody else knows about it.

01:26:49.537 --> 01:26:51.331
It's my secret spot.

01:26:52.081 --> 01:26:55.376
Oh God, I used to take
the train here all the time.

01:26:56.169 --> 01:26:57.795
Did you always like the sea?

01:26:57.795 --> 01:26:59.297
Didn't I tell you?

01:27:00.423 --> 01:27:02.967
I'm gonna come back
as a fish in my next life.

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:07.430
I'm only doing ballet right now
because I can't become a fish yet.

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:10.767
[Ok-ju] Of all things,
you wanna be reborn as a fish?

01:27:11.684 --> 01:27:12.810
"Of all things"?

01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:15.438
[scoffs] I believe
that the earth belongs to the fish.

01:27:15.438 --> 01:27:17.732
And us humans
are just living in their world.

01:27:20.944 --> 01:27:22.779
Wow! Look at that.

01:27:22.779 --> 01:27:25.198
