[officer]

00:03.963 --> 00:05.631
<i>I don't miss Porzingis.</i>

00:05.673 --> 00:06.799
I'm glad the Knicks

00:05.673 --> 00:06.799
got rid of him.

00:06.841 --> 00:07.842
That's crazy.

00:07.883 --> 00:08.884
You never trade a seven-footer

00:08.926 --> 00:10.260
with three-point range.

00:12.095 --> 00:14.431
Why is the precinct

00:12.095 --> 00:14.431
full of bunnies?

00:14.473 --> 00:16.224
[muffled shouting, indistinct]

00:16.266 --> 00:18.226
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

00:18.268 --> 00:19.895
[cackles]

00:18.268 --> 00:19.895
Oh!

00:20.855 --> 00:22.898
-This is still going on?

00:20.855 --> 00:22.898
-What is?

00:24.358 --> 00:28.153
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:24.358 --> 00:28.153
welcome to the Halloween heist!

00:28.195 --> 00:29.613
[cheering]

00:29.655 --> 00:31.448
[air horn blaring]

00:31.490 --> 00:33.116
[theme music playing]

00:51.468 --> 00:53.094
[Jake]

00:51.468 --> 00:53.094
<i>Happy Halloween.</i>

00:53.136 --> 00:54.680
I see you all

00:53.136 --> 00:54.680
have your game faces on.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.557
Special shout-out to Amy

00:54.722 --> 00:56.557
who is clearly only wearing

00:56.598 --> 00:59.100
that pumpkin costume

00:56.598 --> 00:59.100
to conceal her heist equipment.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.228
Nuh-uh. I was greeting kids

00:59.142 --> 01:01.228
at the Halloween party.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.689
-Nobody believes you.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.689
-Anyhow, will there

01:01.269 --> 01:03.689
be a new champion

01:03.731 --> 01:05.524
crowned this year,

01:03.731 --> 01:05.524
or will I become

01:05.566 --> 01:06.859
the first ever

01:05.566 --> 01:06.859
three-time winner,

01:06.901 --> 01:08.193
building on my

01:06.901 --> 01:08.193
glorious victories

01:08.235 --> 01:10.111
in heists one and five?

01:10.153 --> 01:11.196
You didn't win

01:10.153 --> 01:11.196
the fifth heist.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.155
I did when you proposed to me.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.782
[Holt] I won that year.

01:13.824 --> 01:16.535
You ended up with a modified

01:13.824 --> 01:16.535
version of the cummerbund,

01:16.577 --> 01:18.787
and you only got that because

01:16.577 --> 01:18.787
you slept your way into it.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.330
Sorry, sir, that no one here

01:18.829 --> 01:20.330
wants to bone you,

01:20.372 --> 01:21.790
you dusty, old skeleton.

01:21.832 --> 01:23.959
-[Holt] Whoa!

01:21.832 --> 01:23.959
-[Rosa laughs]

01:24.001 --> 01:27.046
Okay, so this segs me nicely

01:24.001 --> 01:27.046
into my next point: decorum.

01:27.086 --> 01:28.380
This is supposed to be a fun day

01:28.422 --> 01:29.464
that brings us

01:28.422 --> 01:29.464
all closer together,

01:29.506 --> 01:30.716
but in the past few years,

01:30.758 --> 01:31.675
I've noticed it trending

01:31.717 --> 01:33.092
in the opposite direction.

01:33.134 --> 01:34.135
[Holt] Is this about

01:33.134 --> 01:34.135
the surveillance system

01:34.177 --> 01:35.178
I set up in your apartment?

01:35.220 --> 01:37.389
Sleep, sleep, you ugly morons.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.058
No, but it is now.

01:39.098 --> 01:41.226
All right, look, the point is,

01:39.098 --> 01:41.226
this year when we team up,

01:41.268 --> 01:43.353
there will be no betrayals

01:41.268 --> 01:43.353
because at the end of the day,

01:43.395 --> 01:45.313
we're all friends,

01:43.395 --> 01:45.313
and we love each other,

01:45.355 --> 01:48.025
and also you'll be handcuffed

01:45.355 --> 01:48.025
to your partner.

01:48.067 --> 01:49.944
If you undo them, you lose.

01:49.985 --> 01:52.613
Now, in each of

01:49.985 --> 01:52.613
these envelopes is a name.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.448
The last four champs

01:52.654 --> 01:54.448
will pick their partners,

01:54.489 --> 01:56.909
and, since I'm already up here,

01:54.489 --> 01:56.909
I'll just go first so--

01:56.951 --> 01:59.620
Nope. You've obviously rigged

01:56.951 --> 01:59.620
this to get the best teammate,

01:59.661 --> 02:00.662
but I'm not falling

01:59.661 --> 02:00.662
for that crap this time.

02:00.704 --> 02:04.041
So I am going to partner with

02:04.083 --> 02:05.500
Scully.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.252
You know what? We are friends,

02:05.542 --> 02:07.252
best friends.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.420
Sorry I took your envelope.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.588
No, no, no!

02:08.462 --> 02:09.588
It's too late.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.631
Boyle, cuff 'em.

02:10.672 --> 02:11.632
It's okay, Rosa.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.008
I'm focused this year,

02:13.050 --> 02:14.468
and I'm more determined

02:13.050 --> 02:14.468
to win than ever.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.219
I also really have to

02:14.509 --> 02:16.219
go to the bathroom.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.429
Why didn't you say that before

02:17.471 --> 02:18.597
he put the handcuffs on us?

02:18.639 --> 02:20.641
[Amy]

02:18.639 --> 02:20.641
Okay, I'll go next.

02:20.682 --> 02:23.560
I have...

02:20.682 --> 02:23.560
[chuckles]

02:23.602 --> 02:24.686
-Geppetto?

02:23.602 --> 02:24.686
-Yeah.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.105
Ugh, that must be Charles.

02:26.187 --> 02:27.439
It is because

02:26.187 --> 02:27.439
I'm the puppeteer,

02:27.481 --> 02:29.149
and you're all

02:27.481 --> 02:29.149
my little puppets.

02:29.190 --> 02:31.777
Ugh. Can we choke our partner

02:29.190 --> 02:31.777
to death with our handcuffs?

02:31.819 --> 02:33.112
Sure, choke away.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.112
Terry?

02:33.153 --> 02:35.864
I'm out. Terry is retiring

02:33.153 --> 02:35.864
from heisting.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.992
I don't have anything left to

02:35.906 --> 02:37.992
prove after my win last year.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.118
[Jake] But we need you.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.368
What if one of us has a plan

02:40.410 --> 02:41.703
that involves a big,

02:40.410 --> 02:41.703
strong brute?

02:41.745 --> 02:43.038
Not a great sales pitch,

02:41.745 --> 02:43.038
Jake.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.916
-Terry is going out on top.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.916
-Ugh, fine.

02:45.958 --> 02:49.628
I guess that makes it my turn,

02:45.958 --> 02:49.628
so I will pick my partner.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.921
And it is...

02:51.713 --> 02:53.381
Oh, oh!

02:51.713 --> 02:53.381
Raymond Holt.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.134
Well, well, well,

02:53.423 --> 02:55.134
it appears

02:55.174 --> 02:57.218
the original two heist champs

02:55.174 --> 02:57.218
are teaming up.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.805
Should we just skip ahead so

02:57.260 --> 02:59.805
everyone can bow down to us

02:57.260 --> 02:59.805
now?

02:59.847 --> 03:02.599
Yes, you all heard him.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.599
Bow down. Boyle, you first.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.893
He is not gonna bow do--ugh,

03:02.641 --> 03:04.893
he's already doing it.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.770
Well, they're gonna win.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.770
I'm currying favor.

03:06.812 --> 03:09.272
So what prize are we

03:06.812 --> 03:09.272
playing for, you ask?

03:09.314 --> 03:11.150
Wait, what about me?

03:09.314 --> 03:11.150
Nobody picked my envelope.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.404
So what prize are we

03:13.735 --> 03:16.404
playing for, you ask?

03:16.446 --> 03:17.948
[heavenly choral music]

03:17.990 --> 03:19.908
Ooh, the Infinity Gauntlet

03:17.990 --> 03:19.908
from<i> The Avengers.</i>

03:19.950 --> 03:21.743
Yes, except not quite.

03:21.785 --> 03:24.121
The actual movie replica

03:21.785 --> 03:24.121
was extremely expensive,

03:24.163 --> 03:25.747
so I had to get something

03:24.163 --> 03:25.747
off Russian eBay.

03:25.789 --> 03:29.001
Say hello to

03:25.789 --> 03:29.001
the Infinitude Gobbler.

03:29.043 --> 03:31.419
It's identical to the one

03:29.043 --> 03:31.419
that Thaboo wore

03:31.461 --> 03:32.629
in the movie<i> Avengaboys.</i>

03:32.671 --> 03:34.089
-This glove...

03:32.671 --> 03:34.089
-Gobbler.

03:34.131 --> 03:37.009
Contains

03:34.131 --> 03:37.009
three plastic jewels...

03:37.051 --> 03:38.426
The Infinitude Gems.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.387
Each representing one aspect

03:38.468 --> 03:40.387
of a heist winner.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.305
"Amazing," "human," "genius."

03:42.347 --> 03:44.599
Whoever possesses

03:42.347 --> 03:44.599
these stones at midnight

03:44.641 --> 03:45.934
will be named champion.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.602
[Jake] But what obstacles

03:45.976 --> 03:47.602
will I face,

03:47.644 --> 03:48.854
you may ask yourself.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.772
Well, the Infinitude Gems

03:48.896 --> 03:50.772
will be guarded

03:50.814 --> 03:53.400
by a ferocious

03:50.814 --> 03:53.400
and daunting sentry.

03:55.027 --> 03:57.112
-Hey, best friends.

03:55.027 --> 03:57.112
-[Rosa] We're not

03:55.027 --> 03:57.112
your best friends, Bill.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.239
[laughs] You don't get

03:57.154 --> 03:59.239
to decide that.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.241
So Bill will hide the gems

03:59.280 --> 04:01.241
in his pockets.

04:01.282 --> 04:02.826
You're really gonna

04:01.282 --> 04:02.826
have to root around in there.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.786
I dried my jeans,

04:02.868 --> 04:04.786
so they're extra tight.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.329
You were right, Amy.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.329
I shoulda got a safe.

04:06.371 --> 04:09.124
Sorry, everyone.

04:06.371 --> 04:09.124
Let the heist begin!

04:11.334 --> 04:14.254
[Holt] I can't believe

04:11.334 --> 04:14.254
the two strongest competitors

04:11.334 --> 04:14.254
got partnered up.

04:14.295 --> 04:18.842
We're a dream team like

04:14.295 --> 04:18.842
in the 1992 Summer Olympics.

04:18.884 --> 04:20.886
Okay, I know you're

04:18.884 --> 04:20.886
not talking about basketball,

04:20.928 --> 04:22.846
so just tell me what weird

04:20.928 --> 04:22.846
sport you think the Dream

04:20.928 --> 04:22.846
Team was from.

04:22.888 --> 04:25.224
Sport? I'm talking about

04:22.888 --> 04:25.224
the opening ceremonies.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.434
Agnes Baltsa

04:25.265 --> 04:27.434
and Alfredo Kraus

04:27.475 --> 04:29.895
singing back-to-back arias.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.354
Wonderful, yes,

04:29.937 --> 04:31.354
we are just like

04:31.396 --> 04:34.441
-Agnes and Alfredo

04:31.396 --> 04:34.441
all thanks to me.

04:31.396 --> 04:34.441
-What?

04:34.482 --> 04:36.359
Oh, yeah. I rigged the envelopes

04:34.482 --> 04:36.359
so that we could team up.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.278
But you chose

04:36.401 --> 04:38.278
Scully initially.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.321
Only because I knew

04:38.319 --> 04:40.321
as soon as I tried to go first,

04:40.363 --> 04:41.740
Rosa would jump in,

04:40.363 --> 04:41.740
and then I made sure

04:41.782 --> 04:43.658
no one picked our envelopes

04:41.782 --> 04:43.658
by marking them

04:43.700 --> 04:44.993
with Cheeto thumbprints.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.787
Oh, so everyone would assume

04:46.828 --> 04:48.371
that they were

04:46.828 --> 04:48.371
Hitchcock and Scully's.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.831
Brilliant.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.833
These fools don't stand

04:49.873 --> 04:51.833
a chance against us.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.127
Yeah, they really are fools,

04:51.875 --> 04:53.127
aren't they?

04:53.168 --> 04:55.170
Just like whoever

04:53.168 --> 04:55.170
Agnes and Alfredo

04:55.212 --> 04:56.838
beat at singing to get

04:55.212 --> 04:56.838
into the Olympics.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.673
-I know nothing about opera.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.673
-No, you're right.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.342
Amy's a real

04:58.715 --> 05:01.342
Teresa Berganza, huh?

05:01.384 --> 05:03.053
[laughter]

05:03.095 --> 05:05.139
[laughing]

05:03.095 --> 05:05.139
I don't know.

05:05.180 --> 05:06.640
[Charles]

05:05.180 --> 05:06.640
Look at them laughing.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.349
Jake must have said

05:06.681 --> 05:08.349
something really funny.

05:08.391 --> 05:09.935
Should we forfeit

05:08.391 --> 05:09.935
and go hear what it was?

05:09.977 --> 05:11.686
No, Charles,

05:09.977 --> 05:11.686
we're not forfeiting.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.438
I wanted Jake

05:11.728 --> 05:13.438
to rig the envelopes

05:13.480 --> 05:15.023
and partner up with Holt.

05:15.065 --> 05:17.276
I gave him the idea

05:15.065 --> 05:17.276
by making him watch<i> Lincoln.</i>

05:17.317 --> 05:19.861
Oh, wow, a team of rivals.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.071
Mm-hmm.

05:21.113 --> 05:22.405
And when that didn't work,

05:22.447 --> 05:24.116
we watched

05:22.447 --> 05:24.116
<i>X-Men: Days of Future Past</i> .

05:24.158 --> 05:26.910
Magneto and Professor X

05:24.158 --> 05:26.910
working together?

05:26.952 --> 05:28.578
Amy, are you seeing this?

05:28.620 --> 05:31.498
Yes, I see it.

05:28.620 --> 05:31.498
[whispers] I see it all.

05:31.539 --> 05:34.709
Why would you do that?

05:31.539 --> 05:34.709
Jake and Holt are like

05:31.539 --> 05:34.709
the '92 dream team.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.128
I know you're not talking

05:34.751 --> 05:36.128
about sports,

05:36.170 --> 05:37.336
so who do you think

05:36.170 --> 05:37.336
the '92 Dream Team was?

05:37.378 --> 05:39.298
-Aladdin and Abu.

05:37.378 --> 05:39.298
-Right.

05:39.338 --> 05:41.716
Look, Jake and Holt

05:39.338 --> 05:41.716
are too stubborn

05:41.758 --> 05:43.551
and too proud to work as a team.

05:43.593 --> 05:46.554
Once they implode, we'll waltz

05:43.593 --> 05:46.554
in and grab the gems.

05:46.596 --> 05:47.764
I do love waltzing.

05:47.806 --> 05:48.890
What about Rosa and Scully?

05:48.932 --> 05:50.225
I'm not too worried

05:48.932 --> 05:50.225
about them.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.643
Hey, Rosa,

05:50.267 --> 05:51.643
you brought headphones right?

05:51.685 --> 05:53.770
-To drown out the sound?

05:51.685 --> 05:53.770
-No.

05:53.812 --> 05:56.355
Oh boy, I'm really sorry

05:53.812 --> 05:56.355
for what's heading your way.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.110
-[Rosa screams]

05:57.482 --> 06:00.110
-[Scully] I'm sorry!

06:00.152 --> 06:01.736
-So here's the plan.

06:00.152 --> 06:01.736
-Okay.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.616
We're gonna need pliers,

06:03.780 --> 06:06.616
grappling hook...

06:06.658 --> 06:08.118
Wait. Amy, look.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.368
[Amy gasps]

06:09.410 --> 06:11.538
The bullpen's

06:09.410 --> 06:11.538
filling up with smoke.

06:11.579 --> 06:14.791
-Oh, someone's making a move.

06:11.579 --> 06:14.791
-That's right. And that

06:11.579 --> 06:14.791
someone is us.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.793
-Seems like

06:14.833 --> 06:16.793
a pretty sloppy plan.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.793
-You're just saying it's sloppy

06:16.835 --> 06:18.419
because you're jealous

06:16.835 --> 06:18.419
you didn't think of it.

06:18.461 --> 06:19.671
You don't even know

06:18.461 --> 06:19.671
what we're doing yet.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.006
Fog up the room

06:19.713 --> 06:21.006
until no one can see

06:21.048 --> 06:22.381
and then steal the gems.

06:22.423 --> 06:23.800
Yeah, but I also got us

06:22.423 --> 06:23.800
little booties,

06:23.842 --> 06:25.426
so we can move

06:23.842 --> 06:25.426
through the room quietly.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.971
And I memorized the exact

06:25.468 --> 06:27.971
layout of the entire bullpen

06:28.013 --> 06:30.598
using a blindfold

06:28.013 --> 06:30.598
so follow me.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.810
One, two, three, desk.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.437
One, two, turn.

06:36.479 --> 06:39.358
One, two, three, four, Bill.

06:39.398 --> 06:40.692
-Hi, boys.

06:39.398 --> 06:40.692
-Oh, God!

06:40.734 --> 06:42.361
Why do you sound horny?

06:40.734 --> 06:42.361
Very upsetting.

06:42.401 --> 06:43.904
Okay, reaching

06:42.401 --> 06:43.904
into your pockets,

06:43.945 --> 06:45.822
feeling a lot of things,

06:43.945 --> 06:45.822
and I got the gems.

06:45.864 --> 06:47.282
Let's go.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.408
One, two, three--oh!

06:49.450 --> 06:50.911
Whoa.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.704
Was that the gems?

06:50.952 --> 06:52.704
Did you drop them?

06:52.746 --> 06:54.248
That chair wasn't

06:52.746 --> 06:54.248
supposed to be there.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.957
-Where'd they go?

06:54.289 --> 06:55.957
-I can't see anything.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.376
Turn off the smoke.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.211
It's lucky I was prepared

06:57.416 --> 06:59.211
for you to fail.

06:59.253 --> 07:01.713
Now, I didn't wanna reveal him

06:59.253 --> 07:01.713
this early, but...

07:01.755 --> 07:03.215
[high pitch whistle]

07:03.257 --> 07:05.884
["I Wanna Be Your Dog" by

07:03.257 --> 07:05.884
The Stooges plays]

07:17.687 --> 07:18.855
[Holt] Here he comes.

07:18.897 --> 07:21.358
Cheddar, Cheddar the Dog.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.568
Yeah, we all knew he was coming.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.568
You don't have to make such a

07:21.400 --> 07:23.568
meal out of it.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.112
Go, Cheddar.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.112
<i>Arcessere.</i>

07:25.153 --> 07:27.655
Means fetch.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.655
Cheddar's been taking Latin.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.908
-Who has the gems?

07:27.697 --> 07:29.908
What's going on?

07:27.697 --> 07:29.908
-[Scully] And explain quickly.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.493
-I have to pee again.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.493
-You're too late.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.621
For the last three months,

07:32.535 --> 07:34.621
I have been training Cheddar

07:34.662 --> 07:36.456
to retrieve gems.

07:36.497 --> 07:39.834
Using his low center of gravity

07:36.497 --> 07:39.834
and keen sense of smell,

07:39.876 --> 07:41.295
he expertly--

07:39.876 --> 07:41.295
[gasps]

07:41.336 --> 07:43.463
Oh, no.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.463
He swallowed them.

07:43.504 --> 07:44.714
He swallowed the gems!

07:45.966 --> 07:47.550
Well, [bleep].

07:50.845 --> 07:53.974
Mmm, got a pedicure,

07:50.845 --> 07:53.974
made a smoothie

07:54.015 --> 07:55.600
'cause Terry loves smoothies.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.728
Retiring early was the best

07:55.642 --> 07:58.728
decision I have ever made.

07:58.770 --> 07:59.896
Well, you're missing out.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.231
People are saying this is

08:01.273 --> 08:02.732
the most fun heist

08:01.273 --> 08:02.732
we've ever done.

08:02.774 --> 08:04.525
Looks like Holt keeps trying

08:02.774 --> 08:04.525
to put his whole hand

08:04.567 --> 08:06.945
in Cheddar's mouth

08:04.567 --> 08:06.945
while Rosa Googles,

08:06.987 --> 08:08.613
"how to make a dog vomit."

08:08.655 --> 08:09.906
Yeah.

08:09.948 --> 08:10.991
Like I said,

08:09.948 --> 08:10.991
we're having a blast.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.200
[giggles]

08:12.242 --> 08:14.035
Why would he have

08:12.242 --> 08:14.035
swallowed the gems?

08:14.077 --> 08:16.788
Well, a photograph of Cheddar

08:14.077 --> 08:16.788
was featured on<i> Chonky Pups</i> ,

08:16.830 --> 08:19.124
an Instagram account

08:16.830 --> 08:19.124
for overweight pets.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.501
A top comment called him

08:19.166 --> 08:21.501
a "thick king."

08:21.542 --> 08:23.753
Kevin and I put him on a diet,

08:21.542 --> 08:23.753
and I suppose

08:23.795 --> 08:27.007
he got hungry enough to

08:23.795 --> 08:27.007
mistake the gems for food.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.967
This is why you don't

08:27.048 --> 08:28.967
team up with a dog.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.635
It's better than

08:29.009 --> 08:30.635
teaming up with Bill

08:29.009 --> 08:30.635
like you do every year.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.053
Bill is a human.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.930
He is able to use more

08:32.095 --> 08:33.930
than just his mouth.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.141
-Not if you don't want me to.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.141
-Bill, stop chiming in.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.892
I'm just saying. I'm not

08:36.183 --> 08:37.892
that different than a dog.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.311
You're not helping.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.562
We need to get Cheddar

08:39.353 --> 08:41.562
to a doctor right now.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.106
Bravo.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.567
What a performance.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.611
Cheddar didn't swallow any gems.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.031
This is all a ruse

08:48.653 --> 08:51.031
just like my brilliant lie

08:51.072 --> 08:53.158
-about the pumpkin costume.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.158
-That was good.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.786
There is no chance in hell

08:53.200 --> 08:56.786
that any of this is real.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.621
Yep, you can see the gems

08:56.828 --> 08:58.621
right here on the X-ray.

08:58.663 --> 08:59.998
Okay, so it's real.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.875
Uh, I'm sorry.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.875
Who are all these people?

09:01.916 --> 09:04.461
We're coworkers involved in

09:01.916 --> 09:04.461
an elaborate Halloween heist.

09:04.503 --> 09:06.213
Do you seriously not talk

09:04.503 --> 09:06.213
to your vet about us?

09:06.254 --> 09:07.922
Seems to me Cheddar

09:06.254 --> 09:07.922
has the gems,

09:07.964 --> 09:10.633
and he's my property,

09:07.964 --> 09:10.633
so we win.

09:10.675 --> 09:11.759
Yeah, works for me.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.512
Time for the big wrap-up speech.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.138
I'm sure you're all wondering

09:13.553 --> 09:15.138
how we pulled this off.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.682
No, we continue the heist

09:15.180 --> 09:17.682
right here, right now.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.100
I'm gonna open him up.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.894
No, no, no, no. There's

09:19.142 --> 09:20.894
no need to operate.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.354
The gems are small enough,

09:22.396 --> 09:24.022
he should be able to excrete

09:22.396 --> 09:24.022
them without discomfort.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.149
The medical term for

09:24.064 --> 09:26.149
"excrete" is "dump out."

09:26.191 --> 09:27.650
-It is not.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.650
-Hm?

09:27.692 --> 09:29.736
Okay, so we wait until

09:27.692 --> 09:29.736
Cheddar passes the gems,

09:29.777 --> 09:30.904
and then we restart the heist

09:30.945 --> 09:32.113
the next time we all

09:30.945 --> 09:32.113
have a free day.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.032
Perfect.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.032
When will that be?

09:35.033 --> 09:36.368
[Jake] Ladies and gentlemen,

09:36.410 --> 09:39.120
welcome to the Valentine's Day

09:36.410 --> 09:39.120
Halloween heist.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.956
-This is still happening?

09:39.162 --> 09:41.956
-[Amy] Why so curious, Terry?

09:41.998 --> 09:43.166
Hoping we'll let you

09:41.998 --> 09:43.166
participate now?

09:43.208 --> 09:44.876
-'Cause you can't!

09:43.208 --> 09:44.876
-Oh, no.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.545
I don't get to compete

09:44.918 --> 09:46.545
for a bunch of stones

09:46.586 --> 09:48.547
that were in a dog's butt.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.547
What will I do?

09:48.588 --> 09:50.465
I'll have you know

09:48.588 --> 09:50.465
that a dog's butt is cleaner

09:50.507 --> 09:52.217
-than a human's mouth.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.217
-That can't be true.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.553
Well, a dog's mouth is

09:52.259 --> 09:54.553
cleaner than a human's mouth,

09:54.594 --> 09:55.845
and dog mouths lick dog butts,

09:55.887 --> 09:57.722
so you tell me

09:55.887 --> 09:57.722
where my theory is wrong.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.183
He has no comeback.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.851
All right, the heist

10:00.225 --> 10:01.851
will pick up where we left off.

10:01.893 --> 10:04.396
There are six hours remaining

10:01.893 --> 10:04.396
and three teams left.

10:04.438 --> 10:07.023
The now-sterilized

10:04.438 --> 10:07.023
Infinitude Gems

10:07.065 --> 10:09.192
will be placed

10:07.065 --> 10:09.192
back into the care of Bill.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.069
Oh, wow, Bill, looks like

10:09.234 --> 10:11.069
you had a rough four months.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.154
It was actually

10:11.111 --> 10:13.154
a great three months

10:13.196 --> 10:15.823
and then one really bad one.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.034
Okay, but you're here,

10:15.865 --> 10:18.034
and you're happier than ever.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.578
I don't know why

10:18.076 --> 10:19.578
you think that.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.872
Let the heist re-begin!

10:24.499 --> 10:27.627
[Holt] Okay, your smoke

10:24.499 --> 10:27.627
plan was a disaster.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.463
Yeah, because your

10:27.668 --> 10:29.463
dog ate the gems.

10:29.504 --> 10:30.964
Because you tripped

10:29.504 --> 10:30.964
and dropped them.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.007
Yeah, because someone

10:31.005 --> 10:33.007
put a chair in my way

10:33.049 --> 10:34.050
that wasn't supposed

10:33.049 --> 10:34.050
to be there.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.135
I'm sorry.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.136
Are you accusing me

10:35.176 --> 10:36.136
of something?

10:36.177 --> 10:37.345
Was that not clear?

10:37.387 --> 10:38.679
Do you need me to

10:37.387 --> 10:38.679
say it in Latin?

10:38.721 --> 10:40.432
I think-a you

10:38.721 --> 10:40.432
a-sabotage a-me.

10:40.474 --> 10:42.767
I would never. I want to win,

10:42.809 --> 10:45.353
Which is why I'm initiating

10:42.809 --> 10:45.353
Operation: Fabius.

10:45.395 --> 10:48.106
Okay.

10:45.395 --> 10:48.106
That does sound kind of cool.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.566
Well, it shouldn't.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.566
I may have to change the name.

10:49.608 --> 10:52.026
Roman dictator

10:49.608 --> 10:52.026
Fabius Maximus

10:52.068 --> 10:54.862
defeated Hannibal

10:52.068 --> 10:54.862
by avoiding battle

10:54.904 --> 10:56.823
and exercising patience.

10:56.864 --> 10:58.325
I can be patient.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.700
I just listened to you

10:58.366 --> 10:59.700
talk about that Fabius guy

10:59.742 --> 11:00.952
for, like, four hours.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.163
-It was two sentences.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.163
-Ugh, shut up.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.540
And the infighting continues.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.083
I guess Jake and I still have

11:07.125 --> 11:09.377
the only unbreakable bond

11:07.125 --> 11:09.377
in the whole precinct.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.796
I mean, he is my husband.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.632
Uh-huh.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.632
No one ever gets divorced?

11:13.672 --> 11:15.216
-Charles.

11:13.672 --> 11:15.216
-I'm sorry.

11:15.258 --> 11:16.717
I'm just all worked up

11:15.258 --> 11:16.717
because of the heist.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.011
There's heist in the geist.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.387
No, look. There's

11:18.052 --> 11:19.387
something happening.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.348
[man] I have flowers

11:19.429 --> 11:21.348
for Bill Hummertrout.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.558
[Jake] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.558
This is a scam.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.102
There's no one in Bill's life

11:23.600 --> 11:26.102
that would send him flowers.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.187
It's true. Something's up.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.896
Flowers for Bill Hummertrout?

11:28.938 --> 11:30.689
-How many of these

11:28.938 --> 11:30.689
guys are there?

11:28.938 --> 11:30.689
-Flowers for Bill...

11:30.731 --> 11:32.442
-What is happening?

11:30.731 --> 11:32.442
-[Amy] You tell us.

11:32.484 --> 11:33.985
You're the one who just

11:32.484 --> 11:33.985
mysteriously appeared

11:34.027 --> 11:35.278
at this critical moment.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.904
I was stuck in the

11:35.320 --> 11:36.904
bathroom with Scully.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.657
-It was a nightmare.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.657
-For me too.

11:38.697 --> 11:40.158
Hitchcock and I haven't had

11:38.697 --> 11:40.158
any time alone all day.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.742
I don't even know

11:40.200 --> 11:41.742
what he had for lunch.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.495
-Italian sandwich.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.495
-But with what kind of chips?

11:43.537 --> 11:45.205
Okay, stop. We don't

11:43.537 --> 11:45.205
have time for this.

11:45.246 --> 11:48.583
Everyone, form a blockade!

11:45.246 --> 11:48.583
Protect Bill! Protect the gems!

11:48.625 --> 11:50.168
[Rosa] I can't see anything.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.168
There's too many of them.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.461
[Amy]

11:50.210 --> 11:51.461
Wait, they're clearing out.

11:51.503 --> 11:53.046
[Bill]

11:51.503 --> 11:53.046
Yeah, because they got them.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.797
-The gems are gone.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.797
-[Jake] Of course they are.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.924
This is clearly the work

11:54.839 --> 11:56.924
of Charles Boyle,

11:56.966 --> 11:58.635
the son of a florist.

11:58.677 --> 12:00.428
You think I'd make bouquets

11:58.677 --> 12:00.428
that look like this?

12:00.470 --> 12:03.348
With all this baby's-breath?

12:00.470 --> 12:03.348
What do you think of me?

12:03.390 --> 12:06.100
Maybe it was Terry

12:03.390 --> 12:06.100
who sent the flowers!

12:06.142 --> 12:07.977
Yeah, I really wanted

12:06.142 --> 12:07.977
to spend $2,000

12:08.019 --> 12:09.770
on Valentine's Day

12:08.019 --> 12:09.770
not for my wife.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.856
-Ah, he admitted it!

12:09.812 --> 12:11.856
-[Holt] No, Rosa took the gems.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.317
I saw you brush up against

12:11.898 --> 12:14.317
one of the flower delivery men

12:14.359 --> 12:15.610
who handed you the gems,

12:14.359 --> 12:15.610
which you gave to Scully,

12:15.652 --> 12:17.362
who placed them in his mouth.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.864
-That's absurd.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.864
-[muffled] Yeah, that's

12:17.404 --> 12:19.864
absurd.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.617
-Okay, fine, but no one

12:19.906 --> 12:22.617
is getting those gems.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.617
-[muffled] Yeah.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.411
None of you would dare to put

12:24.452 --> 12:26.204
-your bare hands inside

12:24.452 --> 12:26.204
of Scully's mouth.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.204
-[muffled] Mm-hmm.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.039
Who knows what kind

12:26.246 --> 12:28.039
of diseases he's got.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.625
My doctors sure don't.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.625
[chuckles]

12:30.667 --> 12:32.544
Scully, why wasn't that garbled?

12:32.586 --> 12:34.921
Yep, he swallowed 'em.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.921
You can see the gems

12:32.586 --> 12:34.921
right here on the X-ray.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.548
And you're sure

12:34.962 --> 12:36.548
those are the gems

12:36.590 --> 12:38.174
and there's not something

12:36.590 --> 12:38.174
horribly wrong with him?

12:38.216 --> 12:39.758
Well, the part that's

12:38.216 --> 12:39.758
horribly wrong with him

12:39.800 --> 12:41.302
-is if you look here--

12:39.800 --> 12:41.302
-Oh, nobody cares.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.137
What does this mean

12:41.344 --> 12:43.137
for the heist?

12:43.971 --> 12:45.599
[Jake] Ladies and gentlemen,

12:45.640 --> 12:49.686
welcome to the Easter

12:45.640 --> 12:49.686
Valentine's Day Halloween

12:45.640 --> 12:49.686
heist!

12:52.313 --> 12:55.900
We will once again pick

12:52.313 --> 12:55.900
up where we left off.

12:52.313 --> 12:55.900
The Infinitude Gems--

12:55.942 --> 12:58.319
You guys are still doing this?

12:55.942 --> 12:58.319
You know it's April now.

12:58.361 --> 13:00.614
Yeah, Terry, we're still

12:58.361 --> 13:00.614
doing it, and we're still

12:58.361 --> 13:00.614
having a great time.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.323
Why are the gems so pale?

13:02.365 --> 13:04.576
I guess Scully's insides zapped

13:02.365 --> 13:04.576
all the color out of them?

13:04.618 --> 13:06.703
I don't know, babe.

13:04.618 --> 13:06.703
You're undercutting my

13:04.618 --> 13:06.703
whole thing with Terry here.

13:06.745 --> 13:09.330
Anyways, the Infinitude Gems

13:06.745 --> 13:09.330
will go back to Bill

13:09.372 --> 13:12.292
whose life seems to have

13:09.372 --> 13:12.292
unraveled even further.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.085
-Tough March for you there, bud?

13:12.333 --> 13:14.085
-Yeah, just a heads up.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.670
I sold my pants

13:14.127 --> 13:15.670
with the pockets,

13:15.712 --> 13:17.796
so I'll be putting the gems

13:15.712 --> 13:17.796
in my undies this time.

13:17.838 --> 13:19.674
-[all] No.

13:17.838 --> 13:19.674
-I'll give him a fanny pack.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.301
Can I keep it?

13:21.342 --> 13:23.094
This could be just what

13:21.342 --> 13:23.094
I need to turn my life around.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.803
Yeah, Bill, you can

13:23.136 --> 13:24.803
keep the fanny pack.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.306
I don't have to do

13:24.845 --> 13:26.306
anything for it, do I?

13:26.347 --> 13:27.557
Because I will if you ask.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.267
I'll do anything, even...

13:30.310 --> 13:31.936
[skin slapping]

13:31.978 --> 13:33.438
What's that supposed

13:31.978 --> 13:33.438
to represent?

13:33.480 --> 13:35.898
No one answer that.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.898
Anyhow, quick heist update.

13:35.940 --> 13:39.818
-There's less than an hour left,

13:35.940 --> 13:39.818
and only two teams remain.

13:35.940 --> 13:39.818
-Two?

13:39.860 --> 13:41.529
My doctor said

13:39.860 --> 13:41.529
I'm at a grave risk

13:41.571 --> 13:43.822
for a shenanigan-related death,

13:41.571 --> 13:43.822
so I have to drop out.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.784
That's not fair.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.784
I should get a new partner.

13:45.824 --> 13:47.243
-Terry, you want back in?

13:45.824 --> 13:47.243
-Nope.

13:47.285 --> 13:48.745
I want my mango tango.

13:47.285 --> 13:48.745
Slurp, slurp.

13:48.787 --> 13:50.538
Sorry, Rosa,

13:48.787 --> 13:50.538
if you wanna switch partners

13:50.580 --> 13:51.872
this late in the game,

13:50.580 --> 13:51.872
they have to have

13:51.914 --> 13:53.374
the same skill set as Scully.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.669
-I'm available.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.669
-[Rosa] Right, or...

13:56.919 --> 13:58.254
That filing cabinet

13:56.919 --> 13:58.254
kind of looks like Scully.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.880
I see it.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.880
Same flat top.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.882
But if we really wanna

13:59.922 --> 14:01.882
make this a fair switch,

14:01.924 --> 14:04.885
it seems like you need

14:01.924 --> 14:04.885
to start in the men's room.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.806
-Come on.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.806
-Let the heist re-re-begin!

14:12.101 --> 14:13.478
Okay, in five minutes,

14:13.520 --> 14:15.814
ten other bunnies

14:13.520 --> 14:15.814
will march past this door.

14:15.854 --> 14:18.274
We'll blend in

14:15.854 --> 14:18.274
and grab the gems.

14:15.854 --> 14:18.274
It's foolproof.

14:18.316 --> 14:20.360
How is this any different

14:18.316 --> 14:20.360
than my bunny suit plan?

14:20.401 --> 14:21.861
Oh, it's very different.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.447
I gave the bunnies glasses

14:21.902 --> 14:24.447
and little, blue vests.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.615
The vests add nothing.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.159
The vests add gravitas.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.869
Your butt adds gravitas.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.289
[Amy]

14:31.912 --> 14:33.289
Get ready.

14:33.331 --> 14:34.915
Bunnies are gonna be here

14:33.331 --> 14:34.915
at any moment.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.543
How do you know

14:34.957 --> 14:36.543
this is their plan?

14:36.584 --> 14:37.960
'Cause Jake frickin' told me.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.671
-He did?

14:38.002 --> 14:39.671
-Yeah.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.798
He's so frustrated with Holt,

14:39.713 --> 14:41.798
like I knew he would be,

14:41.840 --> 14:43.675
that it's all he talks about...

14:43.717 --> 14:45.885
-[quietly] ...in therapy.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.885
-What?

14:45.926 --> 14:48.388
The thing is,

14:45.926 --> 14:48.388
the bunny vests do add

14:45.926 --> 14:48.388
gravitas,

14:48.429 --> 14:50.473
but I can't tell him that

14:48.429 --> 14:50.473
'cause then he wins.

14:50.515 --> 14:53.017
Oh, hey, is it weird that

14:50.515 --> 14:53.017
Jane Jetson gives me a bo--

14:53.059 --> 14:54.769
You found a therapist

14:53.059 --> 14:54.769
that let you do that?

14:54.811 --> 14:56.103
No, I've been

14:54.811 --> 14:56.103
paying an actress

14:56.145 --> 14:57.522
to pretend to treat him

14:56.145 --> 14:57.522
for months.

14:57.564 --> 14:58.939
She's actually

14:57.564 --> 14:58.939
helped him a lot.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.692
Oh, did Jake ever say

14:58.981 --> 15:00.692
anything about me

15:00.734 --> 15:01.942
while you were listening?

15:03.944 --> 15:05.363
Where are those bunnies?

15:08.867 --> 15:11.244
Boy, that thing's

15:08.867 --> 15:11.244
pretty heavy, huh?

15:14.163 --> 15:17.667
Here they come, my beautiful,

15:14.163 --> 15:17.667
blue-vested bunnies.

15:17.709 --> 15:18.959
My God, they're so cool.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.712
-What's that?

15:19.001 --> 15:20.712
-Hm?

15:20.754 --> 15:21.796
Nothing. I hate them.

15:20.754 --> 15:21.796
This probably won't even work.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.590
Let's. Go.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.759
It's happening.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.759
Put on your head.

15:25.800 --> 15:26.801
Oh, with pleasure.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.428
I love disappearing

15:26.843 --> 15:28.428
into a role.

15:28.469 --> 15:31.055
I'm Argyle James Hopford,

15:28.469 --> 15:31.055
a bachelor bunny

15:31.097 --> 15:33.600
who's carrying out a scandalous

15:31.097 --> 15:33.600
affair with a local goose.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.602
Shut up and put on

15:33.641 --> 15:35.602
your damn head!

15:35.643 --> 15:37.144
Hello, bunnies.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.897
[Amy] Okay, just be cool

15:37.186 --> 15:38.897
and blend in.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.940
[Holt]

15:38.938 --> 15:40.940
Jake, who are those bunnies?

15:40.981 --> 15:42.650
-[Jake] Must be Amy and Charles.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.650
-[Charles] They see us.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.650
Let's go.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.694
-[Amy] Give it up, Bill!

15:42.692 --> 15:44.694
-[Jake] Come on, Holt,

15:42.692 --> 15:44.694
move your ass.

15:44.736 --> 15:47.196
[Amy]

15:44.736 --> 15:47.196
No, I can't unclasp the fanny

15:44.736 --> 15:47.196
pack with these furry hands.

15:47.238 --> 15:48.698
-[Holt] You're hitting me, Jake!

15:47.238 --> 15:48.698
-[Jake] I can't see anything,

15:48.740 --> 15:49.824
and we're all dressed the same.

15:49.866 --> 15:50.909
[Charles] Uh-oh, Rosa's coming.

15:50.950 --> 15:51.910
[Amy] And Bill's getting away.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.327
[Holt] Nope, I got his ankle.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.538
[Amy] Get off me! Get off me!

15:55.580 --> 15:57.206
[Jake]

15:55.580 --> 15:57.206
Someone got the fanny pack!

15:57.248 --> 15:58.917
[Amy]

15:57.248 --> 15:58.917
They're headed for the roof!

15:58.958 --> 16:00.710
[Jake] Go, go, go, go, go.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.547
[cackles]

16:04.589 --> 16:06.674
-This is still going on?

16:04.589 --> 16:06.674
-Was it Terry?

16:06.716 --> 16:09.051
Nope.

16:06.716 --> 16:09.051
Wasn't me.

16:09.093 --> 16:12.221
Wait, if you're Terry,

16:09.093 --> 16:12.221
then that must be...

16:17.268 --> 16:18.770
What's up, losers?

16:21.439 --> 16:23.441
[applause]

16:23.483 --> 16:24.776
-Yes.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.776
-Whoo!

16:24.818 --> 16:26.694
-Wow.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.694
-Whoo.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.988
Rosa, that was amazing.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.988
It was not amazing.

16:29.029 --> 16:31.658
She didn't stay handcuffed to

16:29.029 --> 16:31.658
her partner. She's disqualified.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.410
We'll reset and start over

16:31.699 --> 16:34.410
on the next holiday.

16:34.452 --> 16:36.287
Earth day-- an Earth day heist.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.080
-It's perfect.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.080
-Wrong.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.999
Rules said I couldn't undo

16:38.122 --> 16:39.999
the cuffs, and I didn't.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.376
Oh, not fair. I didn't know

16:40.040 --> 16:42.376
I could cut off Peralta's hand.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.878
I'll file that away

16:42.418 --> 16:43.878
for next year.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.129
Actually, I think

16:43.920 --> 16:45.129
we're one and done

16:45.171 --> 16:46.547
on the whole handcuff concept.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.466
This is incredible.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.466
How'd you do it, Rosa?

16:48.508 --> 16:49.801
Well, back on Halloween,

16:48.508 --> 16:49.801
I knew Jake would make

16:49.843 --> 16:51.886
the first move,

16:49.843 --> 16:51.886
and I had to be ready.

16:51.928 --> 16:53.429
You were hiding in the fog.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.598
It wasn't Holt that put

16:53.471 --> 16:55.598
that chair in my pathway.

16:55.640 --> 16:59.352
No, I did. I wanted to be

16:55.640 --> 16:59.352
the one who was responsible

16:55.640 --> 16:59.352
for our victory.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.020
-What?

16:59.393 --> 17:01.020
-We already lost.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.856
There's no point in trying

17:01.061 --> 17:02.856
to maintain team morale now.

17:02.897 --> 17:05.692
-Dick.

17:02.897 --> 17:05.692
-Anyway, I knew Cheddar

17:02.897 --> 17:05.692
would be making an appearance.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.652
Oh, everyone loves

17:05.733 --> 17:07.652
to see Cheddar.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.111
He's here a lot.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.111
I never bring in Arlo.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.446
-Who?

17:09.153 --> 17:10.446
-Exactly.

17:10.488 --> 17:11.739
I spent every morning

17:10.488 --> 17:11.739
for the last year

17:11.781 --> 17:13.240
giving Cheddar

17:11.781 --> 17:13.240
a taste for ham.

17:13.282 --> 17:14.826
Oh, so that's why

17:13.282 --> 17:14.826
he got so thick

17:14.868 --> 17:16.703
and ended up on<i> Chonky Pups.</i>

17:16.744 --> 17:18.245
I submitted his photo.

17:18.287 --> 17:19.998
And once you put Cheddar

17:18.287 --> 17:19.998
on a diet, all I had to do

17:20.039 --> 17:22.249
was mark the gems with a little

17:20.039 --> 17:22.249
of that sweet ham taste.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.584
Why did you want Cheddar

17:22.291 --> 17:23.584
to swallow the gems?

17:23.626 --> 17:25.044
Because I needed

17:23.626 --> 17:25.044
to delay things.

17:25.085 --> 17:26.629
The second part of my plan

17:26.671 --> 17:29.173
took place on Valentine's Day,

17:26.671 --> 17:29.173
which went perfectly.

17:29.215 --> 17:32.176
-Ah, I wouldn't say perfectly.

17:29.215 --> 17:32.176
Scully swallowed the gems.

17:29.215 --> 17:32.176
-'Cause I tricked him into it.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.387
<i>Wasn't hard. Pretty much used</i>

17:32.218 --> 17:34.387
<i>the same Cheddar-ham playbook.</i>

17:34.428 --> 17:35.847
Table ham.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.391
Seven days in a row.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.393
So now I have to think

17:38.432 --> 17:40.393
twice before I eat food

17:40.434 --> 17:42.520
I find lying around.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.520
Thanks a lot.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.188
I marked the gems

17:42.562 --> 17:44.188
with ham again,

17:44.230 --> 17:45.899
and everything pushed to Easter

17:44.230 --> 17:45.899
when I could finally

17:45.940 --> 17:47.525
get rid of Scully

17:45.940 --> 17:47.525
as my partner.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.527
Doctor, I'm willing to pay you

17:49.569 --> 17:50.653
to tell Norm Scully

17:49.569 --> 17:50.653
not to participate--

17:50.695 --> 17:52.279
Participate?

17:50.695 --> 17:52.279
No, no, no.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.866
Norm Scully should not be

17:52.321 --> 17:54.866
participating in any activities.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.617
He could die. I'll go

17:54.908 --> 17:56.617
call him right now.

17:56.659 --> 17:59.119
Now I finally had a teammate

17:56.659 --> 17:59.119
whose hand I could cut off.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.830
Just needed a little help

17:59.161 --> 18:00.830
from Terry.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.832
Boy, that thing's

18:00.872 --> 18:02.832
pretty heavy, huh?

18:02.874 --> 18:04.625
Did you bring the tools?

18:04.667 --> 18:07.420
But you were retired.

18:04.667 --> 18:07.420
You were loving your smoothies.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.005
Yeah, but after a while,

18:07.461 --> 18:09.005
I felt left out.

18:09.047 --> 18:10.840
And if I'm being honest,

18:10.882 --> 18:13.217
-the smoothies

18:10.882 --> 18:13.217
weren't even that good.

18:10.882 --> 18:13.217
-I wonder why that was.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.219
<i>Maybe it's because</i>

18:13.259 --> 18:15.219
<i>I hammed your smoothie.</i>

18:15.261 --> 18:17.847
Am I the only one who didn't

18:15.261 --> 18:17.847
get fed ham this year?

18:17.889 --> 18:19.933
Wait, how did you know

18:17.889 --> 18:19.933
about Jake's bunny plan?

18:19.974 --> 18:21.935
You weren't the only one

18:19.974 --> 18:21.935
listening in on his therapy.

18:21.976 --> 18:23.853
Of course the bunnies

18:21.976 --> 18:23.853
should have glasses.

18:23.895 --> 18:25.605
I just can't believe I didn't

18:23.895 --> 18:25.605
come up with it myself.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.899
Oh, you know what? Betty Rubble

18:25.646 --> 18:27.899
also gives me a bo--

18:27.941 --> 18:29.609
You guys were listening

18:27.941 --> 18:29.609
in on my therapy?

18:29.650 --> 18:31.569
That feels like

18:29.650 --> 18:31.569
a real violation--

18:31.611 --> 18:33.320
Jake, Jake,

18:31.611 --> 18:33.320
this is Rosa's moment.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.364
Yeah, man, go tell it

18:33.362 --> 18:35.364
to your fake therapist.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.533
-She's fake?

18:35.406 --> 18:37.533
-Anyway, then

18:35.406 --> 18:37.533
I grabbed the gems,

18:37.575 --> 18:39.619
jumped off the roof,

18:37.575 --> 18:39.619
and wrote my name in flames.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.245
Wait, why did you keep

18:39.660 --> 18:41.245
delaying the heist?

18:41.287 --> 18:43.163
Couldn't you have just

18:41.287 --> 18:43.163
won at Halloween?

18:43.205 --> 18:44.373
Oh, I did.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.459
These are the real

18:44.415 --> 18:46.459
Halloween gems.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.669
I switched them out

18:46.500 --> 18:48.669
before Cheddar found them.

18:48.711 --> 18:50.630
I also won on Valentine's Day.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.423
What is happening?

18:52.465 --> 18:54.008
I switched those gems out

18:52.465 --> 18:54.008
before I gave them to Scully.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.927
And then I won today.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.012
So while you nerds

18:55.969 --> 18:58.012
are always arguing

18:58.054 --> 18:59.597
about who the only

18:58.054 --> 18:59.597
two-time champion is...

18:59.639 --> 19:01.181
-[Jake, Amy, and Holt] Me.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.181
-[Rosa] I...

19:01.223 --> 19:03.476
...just became the first

19:01.223 --> 19:03.476
three-time champion.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.269
I guess there's just

19:03.517 --> 19:05.269
one thing left to do.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.898
To Rosa Diaz, an amazing

19:05.311 --> 19:08.898
human slash genius.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.608
[together]

19:08.940 --> 19:10.608
To Rosa Diaz.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.319
Well, you did it, but

19:10.650 --> 19:13.319
always remember one thing.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.737
Those gems

19:13.360 --> 19:14.737
were in Scully's butt.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.363
-How dare you.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.363
-I know.

19:16.405 --> 19:17.698
I'm happy for you, I guess.

19:16.405 --> 19:17.698
I don't know.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.241
Hold on.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.241
I have some math questions.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.619
If Rosa has three wins,

19:19.283 --> 19:21.619
does Scully have two?

19:21.661 --> 19:23.579
-Am I now tied with Scully?

19:21.661 --> 19:23.579
-[Amy] No, no, no.

19:23.621 --> 19:25.873
I'm tied with Scully. You're

19:23.621 --> 19:25.873
tied with the filing cabinet.

19:25.915 --> 19:27.583
The filing cabinet

19:25.915 --> 19:27.583
has more wins than me?

19:27.625 --> 19:28.793
-Yes, obviously.

19:27.625 --> 19:28.793
-Yeah, that's how that works.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.377
-As it should.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.377
-Guys, stop it.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.754
We're supposed to be

19:30.419 --> 19:31.754
celebrating Rosa here,

19:31.796 --> 19:33.464
-not fighting.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.464
-No, no, keep fighting.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.257
It's why I did this.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.510
You know, technically, we all

19:35.299 --> 19:37.510
shared in Jake's first win,

19:37.551 --> 19:39.137
so this might be my fourth.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.596
-What? No.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.596
-Yeah, that's a good point.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.765
Oh, we also helped

19:40.638 --> 19:42.765
Holt win too.

19:42.807 --> 19:45.101
Oh, shut up, Santiago.

19:42.807 --> 19:45.101
Just shut up.

19:45.143 --> 19:47.269
-Excuse me?

19:45.143 --> 19:47.269
-Wow, "shut up?"

19:47.311 --> 19:48.771
-[Jake] How dare you, sir.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.771
-I won two times.

19:48.813 --> 19:52.150
-That is my wife.

19:48.813 --> 19:52.150
-[all arguing]

19:53.943 --> 19:56.029
<i>-Not a doctor.</i>

19:53.943 --> 19:56.029
<i>-Shh.</i>

19:56.070 --> 19:58.238
<i>Fremulon.</i>
