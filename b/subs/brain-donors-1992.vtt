WEBVTT

01:00.227 --> 01:01.717
Here I am!

01:16.143 --> 01:17.508
Who's this?

01:28.089 --> 01:29.317
Look at that.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.386
Watch that ladder.

01:47.374 --> 01:48.841
What happened?

02:13.000 --> 02:16.458
Let me try something here.
What is it?

02:27.414 --> 02:28.676
What's gone wrong here, then?

02:36.891 --> 02:38.791
Won't work, huh?
Here we go.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.175
What are you guys looking at?

03:03.250 --> 03:05.047
Get me out of here!

03:21.035 --> 03:22.730
Here! It's mine!

03:23.237 --> 03:24.602
Do you mind?

03:41.055 --> 03:44.149
- Taxi!
- Taxi! Taxi!

03:50.731 --> 03:52.358
Come on.

05:42.176 --> 05:45.077
Jacques! Jacques, you're late!

05:47.348 --> 05:50.283
I'm late. I have to mow
Mrs. Oglethorpe's lawn.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.238
Stop that!

06:22.883 --> 06:25.215
Stop that! Stop that!

06:25.519 --> 06:28.488
You moron. There will be changes
around here after today,

06:28.655 --> 06:31.089
and I will personally see
that you will be the first one to go.

06:31.525 --> 06:34.585
- Allow me.
- Wipe off those filthy hands!

06:38.031 --> 06:39.760
- Take this.
- Oh, for me?

06:39.933 --> 06:41.764
Carry it to the house, you idiot!

06:44.605 --> 06:48.371
Here you are, my dear.
Do come in, Edmund.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.476
My dear Lillian.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.439
I'm so sorry I'm late,
but there's so much to do

06:52.613 --> 06:55.844
in handling the Oglethorpe enterprises
now that dear Oscar has passed on.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.677
You are a good friend, Edmund.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.342
And such a comfort
in my time of need.

07:00.521 --> 07:03.581
I hope more than a friend, Lillian.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.290
As the lawyer
for the Oglethorpe family,

07:06.460 --> 07:09.395
I have been entrusted
with the last will and testament

07:09.563 --> 07:11.793
of Oscar Winterhaven Oglethorpe.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.900
- Edmund, I beg your pardon.
- Yes, dear lady?

07:15.068 --> 07:17.901
I must apologize,
but we really must wait

07:18.071 --> 07:21.598
for my personal solicitor,
Roland T. Flakfizer.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.504
- Jacques.
- Lillian,

07:23.677 --> 07:26.612
I've been employed by your late
husband for over 1 3 years.

07:26.780 --> 07:30.079
- Are you dismissing me?
- Good heavens, no, Edmund.

07:30.250 --> 07:35.620
I was involved in a minor accident
with the Bentley last year.

07:35.789 --> 07:39.520
Miraculously, he was by my side
to assist me.

07:41.395 --> 07:44.523
Oh, Jacques, I want you
to go to this address

07:44.698 --> 07:46.290
and summon this gentleman at once.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.662
I've been calling all morning
and leaving messages.

07:48.836 --> 07:52.135
- I can't seem to reach him.
- Yes, Mrs. O...

07:52.306 --> 07:55.104
Lillian, how long must we wait?

07:55.275 --> 07:59.075
I can assure you, once Mr. Flakfizer
receives my message,

07:59.246 --> 08:02.079
he will race to be by my side.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.885
Anyone hurt?

08:45.626 --> 08:47.685
Roland T. Flakfizer, attorney at law.
Don't try to get up.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.830
- I specialize in accident cases.
- We're both fine.

08:51.565 --> 08:53.089
I know what I'm doing,
I know what I'm doing.

08:53.267 --> 08:55.701
You wouldn't happen to have
any french fries on you, would you?

08:56.303 --> 08:58.794
All right, all right.
Step back, step back.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.098
I've got injured clients here.

09:00.274 --> 09:03.072
Sir, you have caused grievous harm
to my clients and their vehicle.

09:03.810 --> 09:07.644
And through your negligence, this
child has suffered severe neck injuries.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.441
- Leave me alone.
- Stick with me, kid,

09:09.616 --> 09:11.948
and you can afford enough Nintendo
software to sink a battleship.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.815
- I can sue my parents?
- I sued mine.

09:14.988 --> 09:19.755
- My neck!
- Corruptible youth. God bless them.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.758
My Lord, madam. You shouldn't
be walking in your condition.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.157
This woman is with child.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.093
If any harm came to this infant,

09:30.370 --> 09:33.396
by God, sir, you will
feel my wrath in court.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.600
- What are you talking about?
- Don't try to weasel out of this.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.904
Dozens of witnesses
saw your reckless driving.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.010
How many of you
saw this man carelessly,

09:41.181 --> 09:42.944
and without regard for life
and property,

09:43.116 --> 09:46.677
careen into my clients
at almost 85 miles per hour?

09:49.056 --> 09:52.082
And who of you will tell their story
to my young, 24-year-old,

09:52.259 --> 09:54.386
Miss lnternational
Wet T-shirt champion,

09:54.561 --> 09:55.926
nymphomaniac secretary?

09:56.096 --> 09:58.189
Yo! Right here! Right here! Hey, hey!

10:33.367 --> 10:35.130
Flakfizer's at it again, I see.

10:35.469 --> 10:38.632
- Check for outstanding...
- Roland T. Flakfizer? That's him.

10:40.574 --> 10:43.737
Thank you very much.
You agree with me, I agree with you.

10:44.544 --> 10:47.104
Hold that thought. I swear,
I never touched your daughter.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.844
Taxi!

10:51.785 --> 10:53.275
Here we go.

10:53.587 --> 10:55.350
Get in. Get in.

10:56.390 --> 10:58.881
- Where to?
- Any place with no extradition laws.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.118
- And step on it.
- Right.

11:05.032 --> 11:07.500
- Mr. Roland T. Flakfizer?
- That depends.

11:07.668 --> 11:08.862
- Do I owe you money?
- No.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.833
In a drunken stupor,
did I promise to marry you?

11:11.004 --> 11:12.403
- No.
- Then I'm your man.

11:12.572 --> 11:15.769
- Lillian Oglethorpe wants to see you.
- The Lillian Oglethorpe?

11:15.942 --> 11:20.402
In her mid-50s, with possible gusts
up to 60, 65?

11:20.580 --> 11:22.980
- Yes. Can you come right away?
- Is she still rich?

11:23.483 --> 11:25.348
By all means. The Oglethorpe place.

11:25.519 --> 11:29.421
Big bucks. Yeah, you settle back,
I'll get you there safe and sound.

11:32.459 --> 11:33.721
One-way street.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.919
Don't worry, this happens a lot.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.599
You enjoy driving a cab?

11:42.769 --> 11:45.465
No. As soon as I get
me driver's license, I'm quitting.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.371
A guy's really gotta haul rump
to make ends meet these days.

11:48.542 --> 11:53.036
I mean, apart from the cab,
I'm a pool man, I perform liposuction,

11:53.213 --> 11:55.738
I got me own toupee business.
My motto:

11:55.916 --> 11:58.680
"Something that size
should have hair on it."

11:59.052 --> 12:00.747
Aren't those numbers
clicking by awfully fast?

12:02.456 --> 12:04.515
- You're probably a speed-reader.
- Well, you got me there.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.181
Another two miles
and we own this cab.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.350
- I hope you brought money.
- Oh, sure.

12:08.528 --> 12:11.588
I have a wallet just like that.
Hey, that is my wallet.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.357
When I get some money,
this could come in handy.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.797
Such behavior.
Stealing another man's wallet.

12:15.969 --> 12:19.063
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- I don't believe it. You!

12:20.006 --> 12:21.906
- What are you doing?
- Do you know who I am?

12:22.075 --> 12:23.406
A psychotic cab driver?

12:23.577 --> 12:25.169
I'm Rocco Melonchek.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.972
I hope you know you're blowing
any possible tip.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.705
You were my attorney
in my divorce case...

12:28.882 --> 12:31.316
...until you started dating my wife
during the trial.

12:31.718 --> 12:34.812
And you got the court to double the
alimony request she originally made.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.115
You didn't want her to keep
seeing me in cheap motels, did you?

12:37.290 --> 12:38.621
For God's sake, man,
she was your wife!

12:39.259 --> 12:41.193
- Help me.
- Get off.

12:41.361 --> 12:44.694
All right, all right, all right.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.763
Five-minute break.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.284
All right, break's over.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.150
Wait a minute, wait.
You're a businessman.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.154
- Let's talk business.
- Fine, and then I'll kill you.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.883
I thought I recognized you.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.028
I've been looking for you
for the past three years.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.323
- You're lying.
- Of course I am, but hear me out.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.295
Clients are impressed
by a law firm with a big staff.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.832
The more employees,
the bigger the fees.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.835
So I could use a man like you
in my organization.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.496
Travel, excitement
and a chance for advancement.

13:27.674 --> 13:29.369
Of course, you'll start out
on the bottom rung.

13:29.543 --> 13:32.478
But work hard and in no time you'll
move up to next-to-the-bottom rung.

13:32.646 --> 13:35.046
- You got a dental plan?
- Lose a tooth, you get two free.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.046
- What's my job?
- You can be my chauffeur.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.582
- How much?
- Two hundred bucks a week.

13:38.752 --> 13:39.582
- 600.
- 300.

13:39.753 --> 13:40.549
- 400.
- 800.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.017
- 900.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.747
Shouldn't I be in this
negotiation somewhere?

13:43.957 --> 13:46.152
- 350 and not a penny more.
- I'll take it.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.987
- What happened to 1000?
- I allowed for taxes.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.924
- I want four weeks in advance.
- Five weeks.

13:50.096 --> 13:51.723
Hold it. I'm giving you
one minute to stop this.

13:51.898 --> 13:52.523
- Two minutes.
- Five minutes.

13:52.699 --> 13:53.461
- Seven minutes.
- Nine minutes.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.032
I've stepped into my own private hell.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.560
We'd better get going.

13:56.736 --> 13:59.261
The faster we get to Lillian,
the quicker I can afford your salaries.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.431
For 350 bucks a week, you drive.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.813
Lillian, we really can't
wait any longer.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.348
I suppose you're right, Edmund.

14:11.518 --> 14:14.043
I can't imagine
what is keeping Roland.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.959
- You guys wait here.
- Hey, you're the boss.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.132
The reading of the last will
and testament...

14:27.300 --> 14:29.200
...of Oscar Winterhaven Oglethorpe.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.269
- Roland!
- Please,

14:31.438 --> 14:35.306
call me what everyone else
calls me: "Your Royal Sex Machine."

14:35.542 --> 14:39.171
I wouldn't come without bringing
you a terribly expensive gift.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.439
I hope you like it.
It reminds me of you.

14:41.615 --> 14:45.483
Roland, how thoughtful of you.
But I believe I have one just like it.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.415
Oh, no problem. I'll take it back
and get the money.

14:47.587 --> 14:50.579
Mrs. Oglethorpe, you look wonderful.

14:50.757 --> 14:53.123
I could make love to you
right here and now.

14:53.293 --> 14:56.922
Roland, please. Let's keep this
on a professional level.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.190
Very well, then.
I'll charge you 50 bucks a pop.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.465
Mr. Oglethorpe!
How well I remember him.

15:03.637 --> 15:07.664
Gone now, but not forgotten. I was
never crazy about his taste in clothes.

15:07.841 --> 15:10.435
I hope this speech doesn't seem
like a rambling affair,

15:10.610 --> 15:12.635
which is something I'm sure
we'll be involved in.

15:12.812 --> 15:15.975
Oh, Lillian, you make me feel
just like a natural woman.

15:16.850 --> 15:18.249
I've heard enough.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.216
- Sir, I am appalled.
- Lillian, who is this man?

15:21.388 --> 15:24.414
Roland, this is Mr. Edmund Lazlo.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.082
A likely story. Just look at him.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.922
He's obviously after your money
and social standing,

15:30.096 --> 15:31.324
but I was here first.

15:31.498 --> 15:34.023
Hey, how is everyone?

15:34.267 --> 15:37.031
- Have you got any mustard in here?
- Hey, I'm the boss, remember?

15:37.203 --> 15:39.569
- I told you to wait outside.
- Today's my day off.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.833
Excuse me.
And just who are you?

15:43.009 --> 15:46.342
He's a member of my staff.
Lillian Oglethorpe, Rocco Melonchek.

15:46.513 --> 15:47.912
Rocco Melonchek, Lillian Oglethorpe.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.070
In order to tell you two apart,

15:49.249 --> 15:50.546
one of you will
have to wear a mustache.

15:50.717 --> 15:53.345
Nice to meet someone else who buys
their clothes at big-and-tall-man shops.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.920
- I beg your pardon?
- Why? You can't help it.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.359
Refreshments.
Good idea, Jacques.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.027
He was so devoted to my husband.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.791
Darling Oscar is dead now, you know.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.162
Well, I hope so.
I understand they buried him.

16:09.703 --> 16:12.228
- Just make yourself feel at home.
- Lillian,

16:12.405 --> 16:14.236
I really do believe we should begin.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.773
Oh, yes, yes, certainly.

16:16.943 --> 16:19.411
Will you all please
find yourselves a seat?

16:21.247 --> 16:23.306
Oh, I beg your...

16:24.918 --> 16:26.977
The last will and testament

16:27.320 --> 16:29.788
of Oscar Winterhaven Oglethorpe.

16:29.956 --> 16:33.653
- Do you have a bathroom?
- I protest! This is most irregular!

16:33.827 --> 16:36.990
- Lillian...
- Edmund! Please be careful.

16:37.163 --> 16:41.031
This man is in obviously no condition
to carry on. Rocco, will you continue?

16:41.201 --> 16:45.228
- Lillian, l...
- Right, let's cut to the payoff here.

16:45.739 --> 16:50.540
Blah, blah, blah... Minnesota holdings,
ski boat, ski boat, ski boat... Yacht...

16:51.177 --> 16:53.372
"To my gay lover, I leave--"

16:54.147 --> 16:56.547
It was a joke. I was just joking.

16:56.950 --> 16:58.941
Yes. Now. Yes, here we are.

16:59.185 --> 17:02.211
"All my worldly goods to be transferred
into the care of my wife, Lillian."

17:02.389 --> 17:03.913
- Darling.
- "And because of my love

17:04.089 --> 17:06.183
for the arts, I request
that half my fortune

17:06.358 --> 17:08.520
be used to establish
a ballet company."

17:08.694 --> 17:11.391
Excellent. Wonderful. Nothing like
the thrill of spending an evening

17:11.564 --> 17:13.156
watching a bunch
of anorexics leaping around,

17:13.333 --> 17:15.358
guys with bulging genitals...

17:17.069 --> 17:18.662
I hope I'm not arousing you.

17:19.105 --> 17:22.233
This is all very well and good,
but I wouldn't know the first thing

17:22.409 --> 17:25.742
- about running such a company.
- Mrs. Oglethorpe...

17:26.079 --> 17:29.207
-...as your trusted lawyer...
- You can use those words together?

17:29.949 --> 17:31.610
...and friend...

17:31.785 --> 17:34.083
...I naturally assumed
that task would fall to me.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.722
Why would anyone wanna be
the head of a ballet company?

17:36.890 --> 17:39.723
"And the director of the company shall
receive $500,000 a year salary."

17:39.893 --> 17:43.886
I'll take the job. I have ballet
running through my veins.

17:44.064 --> 17:45.497
Lillian, I'm your man!

17:45.665 --> 17:47.792
Outrageous! I doubt whether
he knows the difference

17:47.967 --> 17:49.992
between the first, second, third,
fourth or fifth positions!

17:50.170 --> 17:52.297
Hey, he is strictly missionary position.

17:52.472 --> 17:56.431
I will not allow a rogue like you
to handle the Oglethorpe Ballet.

17:56.810 --> 17:58.277
This document should be treated

17:58.445 --> 18:00.242
with the dignity and respect
it deserves.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.143
Hello! This is no time
for family pictures.

18:03.316 --> 18:06.251
Charity work. I gather these for those
less fortunate than ourselves

18:06.419 --> 18:08.387
who can't afford pornography.

18:09.823 --> 18:12.053
Edmund!

18:14.127 --> 18:16.960
I demand this man
be dismissed immediately!

18:17.130 --> 18:20.190
- Jacques, you're working for me now.
- For what reason?

18:20.366 --> 18:21.492
- Does it make you angry?
- Yes!

18:21.668 --> 18:23.499
That's a good enough reason for me.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.729
Lillian, I have a dream.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.805
We'll bring in a whole new breed

18:27.974 --> 18:29.839
of ballet-goers
with innovative giveaways.

18:30.009 --> 18:32.375
Leotard nights, wet tutu competitions.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.137
And we'll be the first company
performing ballet

18:34.314 --> 18:35.542
for the hard of hearing.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.182
We'll have the ballerinas
wear wooden shoes.

18:37.350 --> 18:40.148
Mrs. Oglethorpe, this man
doesn't know what he's talking about.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.947
Now, leave this matter to me

18:42.122 --> 18:45.614
and I will sign for you the world's
premier dancer, The Great Volare.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.317
Volare? How wonderful.

18:48.495 --> 18:52.693
Wait a second! Uno pari-mutuel.
Not the Volare!

18:52.866 --> 18:54.697
You know The Great Volare?

18:54.868 --> 18:57.428
I knew him back when he was known
as the Pretty Good Volare.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.196
We served in the Army together.
He owes me one.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.966
I threw myself on top of an 1 8-year-old
Vietnamese girl and saved his life.

19:02.142 --> 19:04.133
- Nonsense!
- That's where you're wrong.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.073
This is nonsense.

19:15.021 --> 19:17.216
Lillian, I am the only one
who can bring you

19:17.390 --> 19:19.324
the world's greatest male ballerina.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.052
For myself, I ask only
a nominal salary,

19:22.228 --> 19:24.560
plus a cut of gross receipts,
a bonus of 25 percent

19:24.731 --> 19:26.494
on anything above break-even,
a $300 per diem,

19:26.666 --> 19:28.258
the use of a company car
and housing.

19:28.434 --> 19:32.029
By all means, make my
husband's dream come true.

19:32.205 --> 19:34.105
What, you want him
to marry a cheerleader?

19:34.541 --> 19:38.568
Give us a ballet.
Oh, this is so exciting.

19:38.745 --> 19:42.272
I can see I am no longer required
as the family lawyer.

19:42.448 --> 19:44.006
Look, I'm thinking of
becoming a lawyer.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.379
- Can I buy your diploma off you?
- Good heavens.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.180
I need you both.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.845
Very well, Lillian. As you wish.

19:51.191 --> 19:54.160
- For now.
- Then this evening I'm off to the ballet.

19:54.327 --> 19:57.763
I must shave, shower, get new clothes
and practice signing your name.

19:57.997 --> 20:01.023
My pearl... I bid you all a fondue.

20:03.236 --> 20:06.728
If you should lose this hand in an
industrial accident, keep it for me.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.635
Gentlemen!

20:46.679 --> 20:48.271
Alan.

20:49.215 --> 20:52.514
I brought this for you. It's not exactly
a bouquet, but it's a start.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.880
So sweet. Were you watching
the ballet again tonight?

20:55.054 --> 20:57.022
Of course. I love to watch you dance.

20:57.190 --> 20:59.658
Someday we're gonna be
on that stage dancing together.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.953
At the rate I'm going,
I'm not so sure.

21:02.128 --> 21:03.720
Alan, don't talk that way.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.761
We agreed that if one of us
got into a major company,

21:05.932 --> 21:07.263
it could only help the both of us.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.827
Tonight I'm going to talk
to Volare about you.

21:10.003 --> 21:13.200
I would love that. I mean, no one
dances like The Great Volare.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.136
Except you.

21:16.309 --> 21:17.970
Catch.

21:19.045 --> 21:20.910
Tickets, please?

21:21.381 --> 21:23.645
No smoking in the theater.

21:24.884 --> 21:27.250
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

21:38.031 --> 21:39.828
Please.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.428
- Five and six.
- Eleven.

21:45.605 --> 21:48.506
Now it's your turn: 25 and 67.

21:50.176 --> 21:51.438
Miss!

21:51.611 --> 21:54.876
These seats are dreadful.
They're facing the stage.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.249
Hey, did we miss
the coming attractions?

22:02.422 --> 22:04.014
Who's the bad guy?

22:04.190 --> 22:05.748
Is Tom Cruise in this?

22:16.402 --> 22:18.063
Do you work out?

22:35.288 --> 22:37.552
- I'm looking for The Great Volare.
- He's on-stage.

22:37.724 --> 22:39.658
And he doesn't appreciate
visitors backstage.

22:39.826 --> 22:43.262
No, no, no, I'm not a visitor.
This is strictly business.

22:44.130 --> 22:46.223
- This creep bothering you?
- No. No.

22:46.399 --> 22:48.128
She's quite delightful, thank you.

22:52.105 --> 22:54.539
Ok, I give up. How come
he doesn't throw up?

22:59.045 --> 23:01.912
Bravo, Mr. Volare. They love you.

23:02.081 --> 23:04.106
That audience wouldn't know
a ballet from a bullfight.

23:04.283 --> 23:06.877
And who are you to speak to me?
Where is my towel?

23:07.053 --> 23:08.953
When I come off-stage,
I expect my towel immediately.

23:09.122 --> 23:10.953
- Do you understand me?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

23:11.124 --> 23:12.591
Fire him.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.458
Tina, darling, you were marvelous.

23:16.629 --> 23:19.257
Perhaps we should meet in my
dressing room after the performance

23:19.432 --> 23:21.662
and discuss your career.

23:22.235 --> 23:24.362
I'd like that very much,
Mr. Volare.

23:24.537 --> 23:26.129
- Thank you.
- Lisa!

23:26.506 --> 23:30.442
Darling, I thought we'd have dinner
tonight after the closing-night party.

23:30.610 --> 23:33.602
Oh, well, thank you, but I'm afraid
I've already made plans.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.476
Mr. Volare, I'd like you
to meet my friend Alan Grant.

23:36.649 --> 23:39.584
It's a privilege to meet you, Mr. Volare.
I'm a huge fan of yours.

23:41.020 --> 23:43.784
Well, Alan's a dancer too,
with the Performing Artists Group,

23:43.956 --> 23:45.014
the nonprofit ballet troupe.

23:45.191 --> 23:46.954
Really? How sweet.

23:47.126 --> 23:51.927
It's a fine idea to keep busy until one
is good enough to command a salary.

23:52.165 --> 23:53.757
My cue.

24:15.488 --> 24:19.185
- She looked 1 8, officer, I swear!
- Too noisy around here.

24:19.358 --> 24:22.191
I'll say. I got twice the sleep
at a Julio lglesias concert.

24:22.361 --> 24:23.988
This guy's gotta get off-stage soon.

24:24.163 --> 24:26.256
Let's go back, wait for him,
sign him up.

24:26.532 --> 24:29.399
Excuse us. Excuse me. We have
to get this plutonium back to the lab.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.626
- Jacques.
- Hey.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.489
- You know him?
- Sure.

24:56.762 --> 24:58.559
He used to drive Mr. Oglethorpe
to the theater,

24:58.731 --> 25:00.824
- then I'd sneak him into the ballet.
- I'm gonna be the best man

25:01.000 --> 25:02.092
- at their wedding.
- I hope so.

25:02.268 --> 25:03.428
Excuse me,
we didn't get your name.

25:03.603 --> 25:04.729
Oh, my name's Rocco Melonchek.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.997
I'm the ballet world's
up-and-coming manager/agent.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.334
I'm here to sign a contract
with The Great Volare.

25:09.509 --> 25:12.205
I hate to burst your bubble, but Volare
already has an agent and manager.

25:12.378 --> 25:14.812
That's too bad.
Any of them real sick?

25:14.981 --> 25:16.676
You don't need Volare.
What you need

25:16.849 --> 25:19.545
is the next great ballet talent.
A young, fresh face.

25:19.719 --> 25:20.811
- Alan Grant.
- Exactly.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.386
- I got it right.
- There's my cue.

25:22.555 --> 25:25.422
Jacques, convince Mr. Melonchek
Alan's the person he's looking for.

25:26.058 --> 25:29.323
This is all well and good, but can
he dance? Could he make millions?

25:29.495 --> 25:31.486
Would he sign a contract
for a lot of money, but take scale,

25:31.664 --> 25:33.029
Ieaving his manager
with everything else?

25:33.199 --> 25:36.032
Sure he would.
Wouldn't you, Alan? Alan?

25:36.602 --> 25:38.729
Can't you see he's watching
the woman he adores?

25:38.905 --> 25:41.373
- You're in love with her, aren't you?
- You bet.

25:41.874 --> 25:44.206
- When's the wedding?
- There won't be one...

25:44.377 --> 25:46.038
...unless I can find a job dancing.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.407
To tell you the truth, Mr. Melonchek,
I'm about out of money

25:48.581 --> 25:50.344
and I'm gonna have to
go back to Minneapolis.

25:50.616 --> 25:53.244
I'll tell you what. Don't you buy
that plane ticket just yet,

25:53.419 --> 25:55.546
because I am gonna
get you an audition

25:55.721 --> 25:58.121
with Roland T. Flakfizer,
ballet director.

25:58.291 --> 26:01.624
- You could do that?
- Sure. They're like this.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.062
Well, let's go to work,
Mr. Melonchek.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.825
I now pronounce us
dancer and manager.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.490
Yeah!

26:10.836 --> 26:12.326
Come in.

26:13.873 --> 26:17.673
Tina, darling. I'm so glad you've come.

26:17.843 --> 26:21.370
You were most inspiring tonight.

26:21.547 --> 26:26.007
I can see that under my guidance,
your career will soar.

26:26.185 --> 26:29.279
Already I can hear the audience roar.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.054
- Who are you?
- Roland T. Flakfizer,

26:32.224 --> 26:34.852
managing director of the
Oglethorpe-Flakfizer Ballet Company.

26:35.027 --> 26:36.995
You wouldn't happen to have
a plunger on you, would you?

26:37.163 --> 26:40.030
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, I see you have a pretty visitor.

26:40.199 --> 26:43.134
I'll tell you what.
I'll get a girl and we'll double.

26:43.402 --> 26:46.132
- You got five minutes, Mr. Volare.
- Five minutes?

26:46.305 --> 26:48.500
My God! Have you consulted
another doctor?

26:48.674 --> 26:51.074
- You are out of line.
- And you are out of toilet paper.

26:51.243 --> 26:53.837
- But we're still short one girl.
- What are you doing here?

26:54.013 --> 26:58.507
- To sign you for my ballet company.
- To sign me for your ballet company?

26:58.684 --> 27:00.174
Swear to God, I just said that.

27:00.353 --> 27:04.346
Why don't you run along
and let us men talk business.

27:04.523 --> 27:07.856
Just leave your phone number
and favorite color with the manager

27:08.027 --> 27:09.824
and later we'll talk business.

27:10.363 --> 27:13.526
- You're cute, Mr...?
- Garvey. Steve Garvey.

27:13.699 --> 27:15.530
I think we have something beautiful,
you and l.

27:15.701 --> 27:17.134
Someday you'll have my children.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.703
In fact, they're out in the car,
if you want them.

27:23.542 --> 27:24.839
Oh, God...

27:26.646 --> 27:27.772
You're still here?

27:27.947 --> 27:29.744
I will have you thrown out
of the theater.

27:29.915 --> 27:33.544
- First, we talk ballet.
- I know nothing of your ballet.

27:33.719 --> 27:36.085
We have a lot in common. I'm
managing director and I don't either.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.086
Look, I don't dance for just anyone.

27:38.257 --> 27:41.715
I am ballet. My dance shoes
are in the Louvre in Paris.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.759
So what? Last year,
I left a raincoat in Cleveland.

27:43.929 --> 27:46.864
Do you realize what I was doing
at the age of 7?

27:47.033 --> 27:49.501
I can imagine. You must be thankful
you didn't go blind.

27:49.869 --> 27:51.734
I was dancing professionally.

27:51.904 --> 27:55.032
Well, whatever you call it: flogging the
carrot, polishing the cue stick,

27:55.207 --> 27:56.731
choking the chicken,
clearing the snorkel...

27:56.909 --> 27:58.968
But I didn't come back here
to rehash good times.

27:59.145 --> 28:02.512
Volare, dance with the
Oglethorpe-Flakfizer Ballet Company

28:02.682 --> 28:06.277
and you can name your price.
Money is no object.

28:06.452 --> 28:12.288
It isn't mine. Look, I'm offering you
a check for $500,000.

28:12.458 --> 28:15.427
It's made out to Volare, Great, The.

28:15.728 --> 28:17.320
I don't dance for the money.

28:17.496 --> 28:19.123
Then you dance
and I'll keep the money.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.664
Look, I will not dance
for your ballet and that is final.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.961
A Flakfizer doesn't know
the meaning of the word "no."

28:24.136 --> 28:26.934
And we're a little fuzzy on the word
"panagglutinin" and "viscosity."

28:27.573 --> 28:30.667
All right, all right. Let's sweeten
the pot. The same money,

28:30.843 --> 28:32.970
- we throw in a girl.
- No!

28:33.145 --> 28:34.612
Then would you object
to me getting one?

28:34.780 --> 28:36.145
I'm a lonely man, Mr. Volare.

28:36.315 --> 28:38.681
I will give you till the count
of ten to get out of here.

28:38.851 --> 28:40.876
- One, two, three--
- Before you get stuck

28:41.053 --> 28:43.681
somewhere around six, I'll go.

28:44.824 --> 28:47.122
If there's anything I can ever do
for you, forget it.

28:47.293 --> 28:49.625
Because I don't do
those kind of things.

28:49.795 --> 28:53.697
And for the last time, I warn you
about that highly contagious rash.

28:53.866 --> 28:59.236
I beg you to see to it at once.
Hygiene, Mr. Volare. Hygiene.

29:00.740 --> 29:02.731
- Mr. Flakfizer.
- Where?!

29:02.908 --> 29:04.341
I'm sorry, I thought
my father showed up.

29:04.510 --> 29:06.239
Come here, come here.
Did Volare accept your offer?

29:06.412 --> 29:07.777
I didn't know the meaning
of the word "no,"

29:07.947 --> 29:09.039
but he had it down pretty good.

29:09.215 --> 29:10.876
You wouldn't happen
to have a world-famous dancer

29:11.050 --> 29:12.347
stuffed in a drawer somewhere,
would you?

29:12.518 --> 29:14.713
As a matter of fact, I would.
His name's Alan Grant.

29:14.887 --> 29:16.582
He can dance rings around Volare.

29:16.756 --> 29:18.485
He's even more talented
than Gorbachev.

29:18.657 --> 29:19.646
- Gesundheit.
- Baryshnikov.

29:19.825 --> 29:21.850
- God bless you.
- Baryshnikov.

29:22.194 --> 29:24.219
Hi. How's it going? How you doing?
You look very nice today.

29:24.396 --> 29:25.920
He's one of the best dancers
in the country.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.463
Hire him for the ballet.
What do you say?

29:27.633 --> 29:31.296
No, no, nay, nyet. I have to find
some way to sign Volare.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.028
When I do that,
I'm director of the ballet.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.196
And, gentlemen, that spells cash
with a capital...

29:35.374 --> 29:37.001
- K.
- You should go back to school.

29:37.176 --> 29:38.905
I hated teaching.

29:39.078 --> 29:42.309
- Flakfizer, I thought you were smart.
- I am smart. I said no to you, didn't l?

29:42.481 --> 29:44.210
I'm offering you two incomes.

29:44.383 --> 29:45.680
Your paycheck
from the ballet company

29:45.851 --> 29:47.318
and then when you sign
Alan Grant to dance,

29:47.486 --> 29:49.477
another hefty check as part
of Alan's management team.

29:49.655 --> 29:51.054
How do we get this
past Mrs. Oglethorpe?

29:51.223 --> 29:54.920
Relax. After she sees Alan dance,
you've got nothing to worry about.

29:55.094 --> 29:56.925
Except for taxes,
depletion of the ozone layer

29:57.096 --> 29:58.461
and diseases
due to any sexual contact.

29:58.831 --> 30:00.822
- That's a load off my mind.
- All you gotta do

30:01.000 --> 30:03.969
is convince Mrs. Oglethorpe
to let Alan into the charity bazaar.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.331
Are you kidding?
I can charm the pants off of her.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.239
Now, that is a disgusting thought.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.968
Gentlemen, you're gonna
have to sneak him in.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.408
Not so fast.

30:15.548 --> 30:17.209
You know, I worry about you,
I really do.

30:17.383 --> 30:19.214
We're gonna make this legal.
We need a contract.

30:19.385 --> 30:21.250
A binding document,
with plenty of loopholes.

30:21.420 --> 30:25.186
Exactly. Jacques, draw up the
standard contract, would you, please?

30:45.945 --> 30:47.173
Hello, Jacques.

30:56.422 --> 30:58.720
We've got years to go before we even
come close to the Japanese.

31:02.461 --> 31:04.019
Right. Sign that.

31:04.296 --> 31:06.264
- This paper's blank.
- I'll fill it in later.

31:06.432 --> 31:08.229
Fair enough. You're not gonna
cheat me or anything?

31:08.400 --> 31:09.958
I give you my word as a gentleman.

31:10.135 --> 31:11.727
Well, you had me until then.

31:11.904 --> 31:15.305
All right, all right. Fifty-fifty split.

31:15.708 --> 31:18.142
- Now, this is more like it.
- What about me?

31:18.310 --> 31:20.175
To show you no favoritism,
Rocco and l

31:20.346 --> 31:24.009
- will also split your salary fifty-fifty.
- Thanks.

31:24.183 --> 31:25.980
That should keep you out
of a higher income bracket.

31:26.151 --> 31:28.483
Come to think of it, that should
keep you out of any income bracket.

31:28.654 --> 31:34.320
Rocco, Jacques, tomorrow, Alan Grant
joins the Oglethorpe Ballet Company.

31:38.597 --> 31:41.498
Ladies and gentlemen...

31:41.667 --> 31:46.969
...welcome to the Ninth Annual
Oglethorpe Charity Festival.

31:47.139 --> 31:49.300
- Let's go.
- It gives me great pleasure

31:49.475 --> 31:52.467
to announce the
Oglethorpe Ballet Company

31:52.645 --> 31:56.012
will be leaving for New York
tomorrow, where we...

31:56.181 --> 31:57.978
You two go and get dressed.
Be ready in ten minutes.

31:58.150 --> 32:01.119
- T en minutes? We'll be ready.
- And you're gonna be a star.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.414
You know, if you keep this up,
I may even start to believe it.

32:03.689 --> 32:06.021
Nice to have a chance to make
someone's wish come true.

32:09.929 --> 32:11.556
That's a nice thing to do.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.474
Well, how did the market close?

32:25.644 --> 32:27.942
Well, roll over my amalgamated,
split my utilities

32:28.113 --> 32:29.842
and double my
capital venture overlays.

32:30.015 --> 32:32.643
Now, call me in an hour and tell me
what the hell I'm talking about.

32:32.818 --> 32:34.479
Pull over. Everybody all set?

32:34.653 --> 32:36.848
We've got everything
so under control, it's pathetic.

32:37.022 --> 32:38.114
- And so is he.
- Good.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.190
Driver, drive on.

32:40.359 --> 32:41.348
Look out for that truck!

32:41.527 --> 32:43.358
- Buffy...
- Lillian.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.429
Get this thing up on the rack
and have it overhauled.

32:45.597 --> 32:48.532
Better yet, why don't you get up
on the rack and I'll see you in an hour.

32:48.701 --> 32:50.328
Avanti!

32:52.905 --> 32:56.238
Here, Buffy. There you are.

32:56.475 --> 32:59.501
- Darling.
- Have you come to see Mommy?

32:59.678 --> 33:01.839
What a charming little animal.

33:02.548 --> 33:04.709
Do you know dogs, Mr. Melonchek?

33:04.883 --> 33:06.976
Know dogs? I used to be a chef
in a Korean restaurant.

33:07.252 --> 33:10.221
Good food, good friends,
good conversation.

33:10.389 --> 33:13.847
Roland, I'm so upset
Volare turned us down.

33:14.026 --> 33:16.824
I know. What a slap
in our collective faces.

33:16.996 --> 33:19.829
Like I told you, he has no respect
for our ballet.

33:19.999 --> 33:22.058
I wouldn't want a man like that
dancing for me.

33:22.234 --> 33:24.896
- Or with me, for that matter.
- I offered him half the moon.

33:25.070 --> 33:27.197
I keep asking myself,
"Why didn't he sign with us?"

33:27.373 --> 33:28.897
Because he said
he wouldn't work with you

33:29.074 --> 33:30.439
if you were the last person
on earth.

33:30.609 --> 33:33.043
- What was that?
- Nothing. Fetch.

33:34.113 --> 33:36.809
My darling Lillian,
Volare has shunned us.

33:36.982 --> 33:41.681
Hold your chins up high, for I have
discovered a fabulous young dancer.

33:41.854 --> 33:44.345
- A talent that soars.
- Volare.

33:44.523 --> 33:45.956
It's Volare!

33:46.125 --> 33:48.252
Oh, good heavens. It's him.

33:48.660 --> 33:51.094
- It's Volare.
- Step back. Step back. Step back.

33:51.263 --> 33:54.027
Lillian, permit me to introduce

33:54.199 --> 33:56.224
- The Great Volare.
- I've seen greater.

33:56.402 --> 34:00.896
SignorVolare, I understand you've
refused to dance with our company.

34:01.073 --> 34:04.474
The truth of the matter is Mr. Volare
won't work with Mr. Flakfizer.

34:04.877 --> 34:07.573
But, my dear Lillian,
I am happy to announce

34:07.746 --> 34:10.043
that I have signed Mr. Volare

34:10.215 --> 34:12.842
to dance with
and to be the artistic director

34:13.018 --> 34:14.918
of the Oglethorpe Ballet Company.

34:15.087 --> 34:17.385
Ladies and gentlemen,
the overture has started.

34:17.556 --> 34:20.422
- Overture to what?
- The ballet find of the century.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.253
- What?
- Roll up! Roll up!

34:22.428 --> 34:24.328
Top-class ballet, this way!

34:24.496 --> 34:26.123
Lillian, just a little surprise
I cooked up.

34:26.297 --> 34:28.630
If you don't like it,
it was Rocco's idea.

34:28.801 --> 34:32.134
Oh, Roland, I love a surprise.

35:33.899 --> 35:35.196
Yeah!

36:07.733 --> 36:09.223
Yo, Rocco, Rocco.

36:30.589 --> 36:34.184
Mrs. Oglethorpe, meet the future
world champion of ballet,

36:34.359 --> 36:36.350
- Mr. Alan Grant.
- It's a pleasure.

36:36.528 --> 36:37.756
Nice to meet you.

36:37.930 --> 36:40.296
Mrs. Oglethorpe, I would like to make
an announcement.

36:40.465 --> 36:43.730
- He's being deported.
- I have found my prima ballerina...

36:43.902 --> 36:46.962
-...the lovely Miss Lisa Le Baron.
- What? Well...

36:47.172 --> 36:48.298
But what about Alan?

36:48.473 --> 36:51.271
Shall we say,
a most unusual technique.

36:51.443 --> 36:53.775
Perhaps better suited
to experimental theater.

36:53.946 --> 36:55.277
You can't talk to my client like that.

36:55.447 --> 36:57.438
If Alan isn't in the company,
I won't be either.

36:57.616 --> 37:00.084
- Neither will l.
- That's a victory for all mankind.

37:00.252 --> 37:02.015
You're making a mistake, my dear.

37:02.187 --> 37:04.314
Lisa, I agree with Volare.

37:04.489 --> 37:06.787
But, Alan, we'll be apart for months.

37:06.959 --> 37:08.586
Remember when you told me
that with you dancing,

37:08.760 --> 37:10.625
- it would be good for both of us?
- Yes, but--

37:10.796 --> 37:13.492
When Volare makes you a star,
you can choose anyone to dance with.

37:13.665 --> 37:15.394
Dance with the Oglethorpe.

37:15.567 --> 37:18.229
Come on. I'll be the proudest
guy in the country.

37:18.503 --> 37:21.267
- All right.
- You've made a wise choice, my dear.

37:21.440 --> 37:26.241
- Then it's settled. I am so excited.
- You're excited? Feel these nipples.

37:26.411 --> 37:29.312
Now, Lillian, about the directorship
of the ballet company...

37:29.481 --> 37:32.177
Oh, yes. Yes, of course, Edmund.

37:32.351 --> 37:35.377
You have brought us
The Great Volare.

37:35.554 --> 37:39.149
And dear Roland has presented us
with our ballerina.

37:39.324 --> 37:43.852
I think it only fair that you
and Roland share the honor.

37:44.029 --> 37:47.362
- Flakfizer? This is preposterous.
- Preposterous, is it?

37:47.532 --> 37:49.056
Why don't we step outside

37:49.234 --> 37:51.828
- and settle this like men.
- We are outside.

37:52.004 --> 37:54.131
Then why don't we step inside
and settle this like women.

37:54.306 --> 37:55.967
Or are you afraid, Lazlo?

37:56.141 --> 37:58.439
- I'm twice the man you are.
- So is she.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.544
And it's driving me mad.

38:00.712 --> 38:02.441
Oh, Lillian, can't you see I'm on fire?

38:03.515 --> 38:05.710
And you, you contemptible cur!

38:05.884 --> 38:08.079
Maybe you don't want to work
for Mrs. Oglethorpe.

38:08.253 --> 38:11.017
- Is that so, Edmund?
- Of course not!

38:11.189 --> 38:13.384
I will do anything
that is best for the ballet.

38:13.558 --> 38:15.492
Well, there's no need
to commit suicide.

38:15.661 --> 38:18.289
And to show you no hard feelings,
how about a cigar.

38:18.463 --> 38:20.055
- I don't smoke.
- Well, I do.

38:20.232 --> 38:22.166
Why don't you run out
and get me one.

38:22.334 --> 38:23.995
And now, since I'm in charge
of the ballet,

38:24.169 --> 38:27.502
just jamming that thought home,
I propose a toast.

38:27.673 --> 38:29.072
Champagne!

38:29.241 --> 38:31.072
I'm not going to work
with such an uncouth pig.

38:31.243 --> 38:34.110
- Certainly, Mr. Volare.
- Now it's on to New York!

38:34.279 --> 38:35.678
And a hefty per diem.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.465
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

38:58.636 --> 39:00.035
Here you go. Here you go.

39:00.205 --> 39:01.433
I'm all out of American currency.

39:01.606 --> 39:04.632
Take a fistful of Romanian 50s,
all right?

39:12.350 --> 39:15.046
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.

39:15.220 --> 39:17.848
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.

39:19.090 --> 39:21.058
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.

39:21.226 --> 39:23.456
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.

39:24.796 --> 39:27.765
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.

39:27.932 --> 39:29.490
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.

39:29.667 --> 39:33.125
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Flakfizer.

39:40.511 --> 39:43.969
The end of another grueling day.

39:44.949 --> 39:48.316
The press conference
is to begin in five minutes.

39:48.486 --> 39:50.477
Roland seems to be running
a little late.

39:50.655 --> 39:53.954
Late? That charlatan
hasn't been around in weeks.

39:54.125 --> 39:57.219
I don't know why you put up with him.
He's never in his office.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.953
He never responds to his calls.

40:00.298 --> 40:02.425
He's totally irresponsible.

40:02.600 --> 40:07.833
Lisa. Relax, my dear.
Everyone is nervous their first time.

40:08.006 --> 40:10.839
Just follow my lead.
I'm very experienced.

40:11.009 --> 40:15.173
- That's very kind of you, Mr. Volare.
- Oh, come on. Call me Roberto.

40:15.880 --> 40:17.404
Roberto.

40:17.582 --> 40:22.986
Lisa, I know an intimate little bistro
with a fabulous view of the city.

40:23.421 --> 40:27.414
Perhaps dinner
and an all-night boat ride?

40:27.659 --> 40:30.423
Well, I don't really think that
would be such a good idea--

40:30.595 --> 40:31.994
I hope I'm interrupting something.

40:32.163 --> 40:34.495
Volare, you know it's not polite
to drool in public.

40:34.666 --> 40:37.829
Roland, I haven't seen you
for weeks.

40:38.803 --> 40:42.705
Lillian, my pile of sweetness.
I'm so sorry.

40:42.874 --> 40:46.037
I've been busy promoting our ballet
at beauty pageants.

40:46.210 --> 40:47.939
And then, of course,
there's my volunteer work

40:48.112 --> 40:50.808
at the breast-implant clinic.
And how I missed you.

40:50.982 --> 40:53.246
In fact, I missed you so much,
two days ago I went out

40:53.418 --> 40:55.215
and I bought a woman
who looks just like you.

40:55.386 --> 40:59.652
- Oh, you silly.
- For you. From you.

40:59.824 --> 41:02.224
Another lovely bracelet.

41:02.393 --> 41:04.725
I didn't want this wrist
to think I was neglecting it.

41:04.896 --> 41:07.023
- Oh, Roland...
- Lillian, l--

41:07.198 --> 41:09.063
Lazlo, I didn't see you there.
I stand corrected.

41:09.233 --> 41:11.793
I saw you, but I chose to ignore you.

41:13.071 --> 41:14.402
Lisa, my darling.

41:14.572 --> 41:18.201
Will you excuse us? Two's company
and three's an adult movie.

41:49.040 --> 41:52.305
- Mrs. Oglethorpe, may we start?
- Oh, please.

41:52.477 --> 41:54.411
Is she a fox or what?

41:55.480 --> 41:57.448
Ladies and gentlemen,
for many weeks now

41:57.615 --> 42:00.641
the Oglethorpe Ballet Company
have been in rehearsal.

42:00.818 --> 42:04.254
Tomorrow we open with
Roberto Volare's interpretation

42:04.422 --> 42:06.515
of Tears of the Swan.

42:06.691 --> 42:12.129
At this time, I wish to introduce
to you the creative genius

42:12.296 --> 42:16.027
behind our company, the brightest
light in the ballet firmament...

42:16.200 --> 42:19.363
Thank you for those kind words,
Edmund Lazlo.

42:19.704 --> 42:21.365
I don't know who does your hair,
but tell me,

42:21.539 --> 42:24.599
where do they do it
and when are they bringing it back?

42:24.776 --> 42:27.540
Well, I had a speech all prepared,

42:27.712 --> 42:30.738
but today I'm going to speak
from the heart.

42:30.915 --> 42:34.316
You've no doubt asked yourself,
"Why has he been chosen

42:34.485 --> 42:36.510
for this task of running
the Oglethorpe?"

42:36.687 --> 42:40.054
Well, the whole story is right here
in my autobiography:

42:40.224 --> 42:42.385
Flakfizer: A Man's Man.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.959
But I like women a lot more.

42:44.128 --> 42:47.723
My intimate views of Jackie,
Cher, Sean, Larry, Moe, Curly.

42:47.899 --> 42:50.561
Over 200 pages
of provocative pictures,

42:50.735 --> 42:52.464
and only one page
has any writing on it.

42:52.637 --> 42:57.802
Act now and you can get one of these
fabulous "Flakfizer is ballet" T-shirts.

42:57.975 --> 42:59.738
MasterCard and Visas accepted.

42:59.911 --> 43:02.175
That brings me to the task at hand,

43:02.346 --> 43:07.784
to introduce the woman I adore.
Behind every great man is a woman.

43:07.952 --> 43:11.410
And thank heaven I have Lillian
Oglethorpe, because, quite frankly,

43:11.589 --> 43:13.250
I enjoy the shade.

43:13.424 --> 43:17.622
Dear Lillian, soon I hope to take you
on a Caribbean cruise,

43:17.929 --> 43:20.830
where we can hold hands
on a soft summer's evening

43:20.998 --> 43:24.161
and watch that old Jamaican moon.

43:24.335 --> 43:27.702
Why that old Jamaican
will be mooning us, I have no idea.

43:28.673 --> 43:30.197
And now, here she is,

43:30.374 --> 43:32.467
the woman voted by her senior class

43:32.643 --> 43:35.168
"most likely to go up
a few dress sizes,"

43:35.346 --> 43:38.315
a woman who would be a man,
except her name is Lillian,

43:38.583 --> 43:40.915
Lillian Oglethorpe.

43:44.222 --> 43:47.055
Thank you. Thank you.

43:49.894 --> 43:52.362
Hey. Hey, what's with all the tears?

43:52.530 --> 43:54.794
This should be the happiest night
of your life.

43:54.966 --> 43:57.025
I know it should be. It's just that...

43:57.201 --> 43:58.862
...I miss Alan so much.

43:59.036 --> 44:02.369
Well, I'd feel the same way if the man
I loved was thousands of miles away.

44:02.540 --> 44:04.531
Of course, I'd be living
a whole different lifestyle.

44:04.775 --> 44:07.801
Here, come with me.
I know just the thing to cheer you up.

44:07.979 --> 44:12.245
If you just step right in here, my dear,
your spirits might just brighten.

44:12.416 --> 44:14.884
- But that's Mr. Volare's dressing room.
- Of course.

44:15.052 --> 44:16.952
He's got the best champagne.

44:20.591 --> 44:22.058
- Alan!
- Lisa.

44:23.794 --> 44:26.194
Flakfizer flew Alan out to see you
in the opening of the ballet.

44:26.364 --> 44:28.195
It's a formal affair.
Do you have tuxedos?

44:28.366 --> 44:30.425
I got mine.

44:34.005 --> 44:36.838
That's great for tomorrow, but aren't
you a little overdressed for today?

44:37.008 --> 44:38.635
Oh, no.

44:42.246 --> 44:44.578
- I'm very impressed.
- I don't have any luggage.

44:44.749 --> 44:47.183
Then this all makes sense.
I was worried there for a second.

44:48.286 --> 44:51.653
Mr. Flakfizer, thank you.

44:51.956 --> 44:54.254
I see you're saving your best stuff
for Alan.

44:56.360 --> 44:58.453
I think we should leave the lovers
alone for a few minutes.

45:02.433 --> 45:04.594
Make that a few hours.

45:12.243 --> 45:16.942
- I missed you so much.
- I don't want us to be apart ever again.

45:17.114 --> 45:20.015
- I told you before!
- Oh, my God, it's Volare.

45:20.184 --> 45:23.119
- You better hide.
- Don't hang my tight by the crotch!

45:23.287 --> 45:25.653
- It throws off my bulge!
- Yes, Volare, I'm sorry.

45:28.559 --> 45:30.652
Lisa, what a pleasant surprise.

45:31.262 --> 45:33.992
I see you decided to start
our little party early, huh?

45:34.165 --> 45:38.829
- Roberto, you've got the wrong idea.
- Oh, no. I think I've got the right idea.

45:39.370 --> 45:42.965
- Roberto, stop it!
- Get your hands off of her!

45:45.409 --> 45:49.072
- You! What are you doing here?
- Mr. Flakfizer flew me out.

45:49.780 --> 45:54.012
You and Mr. Flakfizer are going
to be sorry for this.

45:55.519 --> 45:57.987
- Volare, what happened?
- It's Flakfizer.

45:58.155 --> 46:00.385
He's brought that performance artist
out here.

46:00.558 --> 46:04.324
- Hasn't that information arrived yet?
- No, but we may not need it.

46:04.495 --> 46:08.090
I have devised a little plan.
He's staying at Lillian's townhouse.

46:08.266 --> 46:11.394
All we have to do is make
a few arrangements.

46:28.419 --> 46:31.479
Oh, no. Lillian?

46:40.231 --> 46:43.428
- Well, no one's in.
- Roland.

46:44.769 --> 46:49.138
This is just a business call.
I didn't think you were back so soon.

46:49.740 --> 46:52.834
- Roland.
- Lillian...

46:53.444 --> 46:55.275
...can't we just be friends?

46:57.381 --> 46:58.473
Why, you're not Lillian.

46:58.983 --> 47:02.009
- You gonna spank me?
- We can start there...

47:02.453 --> 47:03.818
...and see what happens.

47:03.988 --> 47:07.389
- Are we alone?
- Servants have the day off.

47:07.558 --> 47:10.891
Lillian is already at the theater,
but I'm here.

47:11.062 --> 47:14.225
- Take me.
- Okay. Let's say two out of three falls.

47:14.398 --> 47:16.161
No standing eight count.

47:16.967 --> 47:19.936
Wait. I wanna make love
by candlelight.

47:20.371 --> 47:21.963
I could do you one better.

47:27.445 --> 47:33.213
I think this is more in keeping
with...things to come.

47:38.055 --> 47:40.387
Not a bad little pad Lillian's got here.

47:41.826 --> 47:44.090
- Was that the doorbell?
- That wasn't you?

47:44.261 --> 47:46.855
Never mind. Just ignore it.

47:47.031 --> 47:49.295
Well, it's a big house.
Maybe they can't hear the bell.

47:49.467 --> 47:51.628
Let's try this.

47:51.802 --> 47:54.396
Wait a minute. I'll be right back.

47:55.539 --> 47:58.940
If you need anything, there's plenty
of batteries in my room.

48:03.214 --> 48:04.875
Oh, let me try this.

48:05.583 --> 48:07.073
Good idea.
You go through the window.

48:07.251 --> 48:09.651
If the alarm goes off, I'll run away
so they won't catch both of us.

48:09.820 --> 48:11.447
We don't want any! Oh, it's you.

48:11.622 --> 48:13.021
We have to talk. It's very important.

48:13.190 --> 48:15.715
Look. The next half-hour,
give or take 29 minutes,

48:15.893 --> 48:18.293
will be very important for me,
so thanks for dropping by.

48:18.462 --> 48:19.724
Yeah, but--

48:19.930 --> 48:22.091
Flakfizer!

48:22.266 --> 48:24.427
- The face is familiar.
- It's mine.

48:24.602 --> 48:27.002
And so it is. Say, if you ever visit
this planet again,

48:27.171 --> 48:28.832
give me a call. We'll have lunch.

48:29.006 --> 48:31.304
- Flakfizer.
- How come you didn't knock?

48:31.475 --> 48:33.238
I'm using a better grade of gas.

48:34.945 --> 48:36.970
- That's not bad, is it?
- You know, I always enjoy it

48:37.148 --> 48:39.082
when we get together,
but I want you out,

48:39.250 --> 48:41.150
or I'll be forced to kill you.
I'll tell the police

48:41.318 --> 48:46.017
- I did it out of love.
- Flakie, aren't you coming to bed?

48:46.190 --> 48:49.921
- That's a girl.
- Not just a girl, a way of life.

48:50.094 --> 48:51.459
What if Mrs. Oglethorpe
comes back?

48:51.629 --> 48:53.756
She'll have to wait her turn.
I saw Tina first.

48:53.931 --> 48:55.990
Don't you see? Lazlo wants
Mrs. Oglethorpe to catch you

48:56.167 --> 48:57.566
in bed with her!

48:57.968 --> 49:00.300
Oh, no!
Mrs. Oglethorpe!

49:01.405 --> 49:05.739
I've been in situations like this before.
We act calm.

49:05.910 --> 49:07.537
Stay cool.

49:11.882 --> 49:15.249
Okay, okay. Tina leaves by the
back door and no one is any the wiser.

49:15.419 --> 49:19.515
- It's an old Gary Hart trick.
- I'm not leaving till I'm satisfied.

49:27.264 --> 49:28.390
You beast!

49:28.566 --> 49:30.966
Really has a such a nice light touch
with women.

49:31.135 --> 49:34.662
You big brute! How dare you...

49:35.973 --> 49:37.065
Get her out of sight!

49:38.509 --> 49:40.773
No, no, no! That's Lillian's room.

49:44.515 --> 49:46.312
- In here. In here.
- Not there!

49:46.484 --> 49:48.384
She can't be found there.
That's my room.

49:49.220 --> 49:52.587
I don't know why you insist
on returning to my home.

49:52.756 --> 49:55.224
We can't miss the
final dress rehearsal of the ballet.

49:55.392 --> 49:58.122
Lillian, my dear,
we can't go without Flakfizer.

49:58.295 --> 50:00.229
I just thought it would make
for a better appearance

50:00.397 --> 50:03.264
if we all arrive at the same time.

50:03.434 --> 50:06.494
You have been looking at your watch
all morning, Edmund.

50:06.670 --> 50:09.537
Your behavior is most peculiar.

50:09.707 --> 50:11.265
You big animal!

50:11.742 --> 50:14.040
What was that?
We must investigate!

50:14.211 --> 50:16.179
Edmund, what is this?

50:16.347 --> 50:18.281
You relentless sex stallion.

50:18.449 --> 50:20.041
Oh, great.
Now she's talking about me.

50:20.451 --> 50:22.282
What was that?

50:22.453 --> 50:25.115
Jacques, show her what will happen
if she doesn't shut up.

50:28.826 --> 50:30.225
That came from your suite.

50:30.394 --> 50:32.385
- Hide her!
- My bedroom?

50:34.365 --> 50:41.635
Ninety-eight, 99, 100.
Lillian, Lazlo. My two favorite L's.

50:41.805 --> 50:43.898
What on earth are you doing here
at this ungodly hour?

50:44.074 --> 50:46.304
I know you're up to something,
Flakfizer.

50:46.477 --> 50:49.139
- A snap inspection?
- Roland.

50:49.313 --> 50:53.807
- What are you doing in my bedroom?
- This is your room? Thank God.

50:53.984 --> 50:56.612
I thought someone sewed up
all my fly-holes.

50:57.154 --> 50:59.645
Lazlo, how about the three of us
going down to the kitchen

50:59.823 --> 51:02.257
- and making a big sandwich.
- I hardly think so.

51:02.426 --> 51:03.791
I'm going to check under the bed.

51:05.963 --> 51:09.626
Edmund! What on earth
has gotten into you?

51:13.037 --> 51:15.972
- Be more careful.
- You did that on purpose.

51:16.140 --> 51:18.199
You're trying to conceal
the fact that--

51:20.578 --> 51:22.102
Your suite.

51:22.379 --> 51:24.279
And I think you're
pretty terrific yourself.

51:25.416 --> 51:28.613
You stay here. There's no telling
what he may do in this crazed state!

51:29.753 --> 51:31.345
Lazlo. I say, Lazlo.

51:31.722 --> 51:33.519
- What are you looking for?
- A woman.

51:33.691 --> 51:36.990
- How about calling an escort service?
- I'm calling the police.

51:39.263 --> 51:43.165
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.
Forgive me. I'm sorry.

51:43.334 --> 51:44.460
The guest bedrooms.

51:56.246 --> 52:00.080
- Roland.
- All right. Get in. Get in.

52:01.919 --> 52:04.615
- Roland, what is all the commotion?
- It's Lazlo.

52:04.788 --> 52:07.518
I've never seen him like this.
Quick, in here.

52:07.691 --> 52:09.921
And while you're in there,
why don't you make the bed.

52:10.094 --> 52:11.857
I know she's here somewhere.

52:12.029 --> 52:13.656
- Lazlo!
- What?

52:16.967 --> 52:19.936
- What was that?
- I don't know, but it came from in here.

52:22.373 --> 52:27.470
- Edmund, this is outrageous.
- I can explain.

52:27.645 --> 52:29.840
- He's got a woman tied up.
- Edmund!

52:30.014 --> 52:32.141
- She looks dazed and drugged.
- No.

52:32.316 --> 52:35.911
He's obviously the grand dragon
of some sex-slave cult.

52:36.086 --> 52:38.486
- And she looks like she's about 1 5.
- No, no, no.

52:38.656 --> 52:41.489
Okay, 1 4, then. In fact, I know she's 1 4
because I was dating her a year ago.

52:41.659 --> 52:44.526
Edmund, I want you out
of my house this instant.

52:45.996 --> 52:49.090
If I had to take a wild guess,
I'd say you're out of a job.

52:49.433 --> 52:50.730
I hope there's no hard feelings.

52:50.901 --> 52:54.029
You know, Lazlo,
this is a good look for you.

52:54.204 --> 52:56.001
Flakfizer.

52:56.807 --> 52:58.832
Lazlo, are you decent?

53:02.413 --> 53:04.244
- Lillian.
- Quick, smelling salts!

53:04.415 --> 53:06.315
And a crane, if you got one.

53:07.518 --> 53:09.748
Oh, my goodness.
You've done it now, Lazlo.

53:11.155 --> 53:13.020
I don't feel a thing.
This woman is dead.

53:13.190 --> 53:15.385
- You're holding his wrist.
- Then this man is dead.

53:15.559 --> 53:18.790
- Mrs. Oglethorpe is unconscious.
- Smelling salts, right away.

53:19.296 --> 53:22.129
Hello, excuse me, gentlemen?
Triple Speed Messenger Service.

53:22.299 --> 53:25.097
I got a message here
for a guy named Lazlo.

53:25.269 --> 53:27.100
Give me that.

53:28.739 --> 53:33.403
This is a litany of fraudulent
accident cases, bad debts

53:33.577 --> 53:34.874
and several police departments

53:35.045 --> 53:36.945
who would love to get
their hands on you.

53:37.114 --> 53:38.911
And when Mrs. Oglethorpe
comes to,

53:39.083 --> 53:43.076
she will read this and she will have
no course but to fire you!

53:44.121 --> 53:46.749
Quick, try some chloroform.

53:48.392 --> 53:51.156
I'm taking Lillian to the hospital.
You, help me get her to the car.

53:51.328 --> 53:53.296
Why don't you take him along
for a brain scan.

53:53.464 --> 53:55.955
Gently. Easy.

53:56.633 --> 53:59.898
- What are we gonna do now?
- What any Flakfizer would do.

54:00.070 --> 54:01.537
What, something devious
and underhanded?

54:01.705 --> 54:03.468
You know the family.

54:03.741 --> 54:07.734
If we don't get that letter before
Lillian wakes up, we're dead ducks.

54:16.920 --> 54:20.822
Multiple fractures?
Lucky day. The name's Flakfizer.

54:20.991 --> 54:24.518
No job too small, no fee too large.
If any limb falls off, mail it to me.

54:24.695 --> 54:26.128
It can only strengthen our case.

54:26.296 --> 54:28.287
Roland T. Flakfizer.
This is your lucky day.

54:28.465 --> 54:30.194
- This man's dead.
- Then he won't be needing this.

54:30.367 --> 54:32.301
- I'm almost all out of business cards.
- Excuse me.

54:32.469 --> 54:33.766
What are you gentlemen
doing here?

54:33.937 --> 54:35.495
We're here to see
Mrs. Lillian Oglethorpe.

54:35.672 --> 54:37.970
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She's on a private floor.

54:38.142 --> 54:40.372
Hospital personnel and doctors only.

54:43.180 --> 54:45.842
Hi. Ed Breckerman, security.

54:46.016 --> 54:49.247
There's a Mercedes on fire
in the doctors' parking lot.

54:57.261 --> 54:59.525
When will Mrs. Oglethorpe
regain consciousness?

54:59.696 --> 55:02.221
She's under a sedative.
You'll have to ask the doctor.

55:02.599 --> 55:05.830
- You called?
- At last.

55:08.172 --> 55:09.332
No letter here.

55:09.506 --> 55:11.371
Right, I'll carve.
Dark meat or white?

55:11.542 --> 55:14.033
Now, this is a very important woman.
I hope you know your business.

55:14.211 --> 55:15.371
Hey, so do we.

55:15.546 --> 55:16.911
I wanna assure you
we've been doctors

55:17.080 --> 55:19.810
- for many, many floors now.
- You're not the doctor I saw earlier.

55:19.983 --> 55:21.746
He caught what she got.
We're filling in.

55:21.919 --> 55:23.216
She's been out since
she came here?

55:23.387 --> 55:24.718
- Yes.
- And so she hasn't been able

55:24.888 --> 55:27.152
- to read anything, then, huh?
- Of course not.

55:27.324 --> 55:30.691
Good. It will bring on complications.
Not for her, necessarily,

55:30.861 --> 55:33.659
- but complications nonetheless.
- She's coming to, doctor.

55:33.831 --> 55:36.231
- Now we got complications.
- She's going out, doctor.

55:36.400 --> 55:38.197
- The crisis is over.
- This is ludicrous.

55:38.368 --> 55:39.995
I don't think anyone will argue
that point.

55:47.477 --> 55:50.446
Let the games begin.
It's the first annual Vasectomy Bowl.

55:50.614 --> 55:54.209
- What is going on?
- A happy doctor is a good doctor.

55:54.384 --> 55:57.285
What is the meaning of this?
Are you sure you're a doctor?

55:58.722 --> 56:00.952
That's gotta hurt.
At least, I hope it does.

56:01.124 --> 56:04.116
- Doctor, we'll have to run a few tests.
- Table for one.

56:04.294 --> 56:05.761
- There you go.
- Ground transportation,

56:05.929 --> 56:07.521
courtesy of Medicare.

56:08.899 --> 56:12.300
You say ether and I say either
Ether, either

56:12.469 --> 56:16.371
Oh, please proceed.
I'm just checking on Mrs. Oglethorpe.

56:16.540 --> 56:18.064
- Well, doctor?
- Yes, doctor?

56:18.242 --> 56:19.766
- Yes, doctor?
- Doctor.

56:19.943 --> 56:21.069
- Doctor.
- Yes.

56:21.245 --> 56:23.406
Well, I thought we'll have to perform
a full "rectumology."

56:23.580 --> 56:26.947
An epidemic. Drop those pants.
Not you, the patient.

56:27.117 --> 56:29.142
- I thought you were cardiologists.
- They're all connected.

56:29.319 --> 56:30.581
We enter the rectum
and head north.

56:30.754 --> 56:32.654
Why do you think we have
such long instruments?

56:33.557 --> 56:36.685
- X-rays for Dr. Blazie.
- I'll take those. I deal in x-rays.

56:36.860 --> 56:39.420
- I see you do too.
- I used to work at Las Vegas General.

56:39.596 --> 56:41.496
Security to Room 1 404.

56:41.665 --> 56:43.895
- Yeah. Hit me.
- I'll play these.

56:44.067 --> 56:45.591
Read them and weep.
Three hearts.

56:45.769 --> 56:47.498
Beats a pair of kidneys.

56:49.506 --> 56:51.997
- Doctor, your diagnosis?
- Difficult to tell from the negative.

56:52.175 --> 56:54.166
- It's her liver.
- Looks more like veal to me.

56:54.344 --> 56:56.312
- What is this?
- An obstruction in the fourth lumbar.

56:56.480 --> 56:57.674
Huge backup
in the lower intestine.

56:57.848 --> 57:00.078
My advice is to avoid the intestine
and plan an alternate route.

57:00.250 --> 57:03.185
Grab a left at the first major artery and
get on the fifth lumbar heading south.

57:03.353 --> 57:05.719
Skeletal update every hour
on the hour.

57:06.690 --> 57:09.352
- Time for a thorough checkup.
- It's gotta be here somewhere.

57:10.661 --> 57:12.959
- The operation is a success!
- Success.

57:13.130 --> 57:15.894
- Success.
- Doctors, we're done here.

57:16.066 --> 57:18.159
Arrest those men.

57:19.169 --> 57:20.636
Come here.

57:20.804 --> 57:23.295
Come on, man.
What are you doing? Come on.

57:25.776 --> 57:27.607
Come here.

57:28.345 --> 57:29.903
Stay still, all right?

57:34.551 --> 57:37.042
- So you were the doctors.
- No, we're not them.

57:37.220 --> 57:40.189
We're someone else. The three you're
looking for are our twin brothers.

57:40.357 --> 57:42.450
You'll never see us together,
because we love the same women.

57:42.626 --> 57:43.718
That's next on Geraldo.

57:43.894 --> 57:44.883
- Roland.
- Yes?

57:45.062 --> 57:46.996
- What are you doing here?
- That's a good question.

57:47.164 --> 57:49.029
- What am I doing here?
- lmpersonating a doctor,

57:49.199 --> 57:51.326
harassing a patient,
altering medical records.

57:51.501 --> 57:53.059
Trespassing,
destroying hospital property.

57:53.236 --> 57:54.726
And don't forget Alan
punching out Volare.

57:54.905 --> 57:56.998
- Whose side are you on anyway?
- Give me that.

57:57.174 --> 57:59.506
- Stealing private property.
- It could happen to anyone.

57:59.676 --> 58:01.803
- Society's to blame.
- Too much violence in the movies.

58:01.979 --> 58:03.776
- It's my environment.
- We were carrying out orders!

58:03.947 --> 58:05.812
It's the Japanese.
They're buying up everything.

58:05.983 --> 58:07.075
Did we leave anything out?

58:11.355 --> 58:13.186
Could I have
a personalized number?

58:13.357 --> 58:15.348
Is my hair okay?

58:34.611 --> 58:36.306
Empty your pockets.

59:09.446 --> 59:11.380
You can make one call.

59:12.616 --> 59:14.015
Hello, Sportsline?

59:14.184 --> 59:16.118
Steamer, hi. This is Rocco.

59:16.286 --> 59:17.480
Am I on the air?

01:00:07.571 --> 01:00:08.697
Give me that.

01:00:08.872 --> 01:00:10.669
Be careful with that.
Do you know who this man is?

01:00:10.841 --> 01:00:13.469
This is Jackson Pollock Jr.,
son of Roy Lichtenstein.

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:15.668
In a few years,
this could be worth millions.

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:25.752
Nobody knows the trouble
I've seen

01:00:26.056 --> 01:00:32.791
Nobody knows my sorrow

01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:39.192
What's it all about, Alfie?

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:44.465
Is it just for the moment we live?

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:53.581
What's it all about
When you sort it out, Alfie?

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:07.222
In the jungle, the mighty jungle,
The lion sleeps tonight

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:14.133
In the jungle, the quiet jungle,
The lion sleeps tonight

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.102
Hey.

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:21.435
- You got visitors.
- Maybe it's somebody

01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:23.306
- with a recording contract.
- Alan. Lisa.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.504
You can go home, fellas.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.376
- You bribed a guard?
- I paid your bail.

01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:28.780
- How did you do that?
- I used my severance pay.

01:01:28.952 --> 01:01:30.715
- You have servants?
- No.

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:32.320
Volare fired me.

01:01:32.489 --> 01:01:34.354
It seems I wasn't
appreciative enough.

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:36.458
- He can't do that.
- No, he's done it, all right.

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:38.787
And now he's dancing
with Lisa's understudy.

01:01:38.962 --> 01:01:40.054
The one with the large chest?

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:41.561
There's nobody in the company
like that.

01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:44.199
- Would be if I were running things.
- This is terrible.

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:45.732
And Volare's vowed to blackball us

01:01:45.902 --> 01:01:47.870
from ever dancing
for a major ballet company.

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:49.630
- That's not fair.
- I know.

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:52.570
- And it's all my fault.
- Oh, it's your fault, huh?

01:01:53.677 --> 01:01:56.009
Alan, don't talk that way.

01:01:56.179 --> 01:01:59.546
Why, I wouldn't dance with Volare
if he were the last man on earth.

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:00.705
Wait a minute.

01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:03.717
Just because you're not in the ballet
doesn't mean you won't dance tonight.

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:05.184
Flakfizer's right.

01:02:05.355 --> 01:02:07.016
I don't know why, but he's right.

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:10.648
And I think it's about time for Alan
to make his New York debut.

01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:14.228
To the theater,
and not a minute to lose!

01:02:19.936 --> 01:02:22.268
- Break a leg, Mr. Volare.
- Grazie.

01:02:22.439 --> 01:02:24.430
Tina, darling.

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:31.914
- Break a leg, Mr. Volare.
- Grazie.

01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:57.401
- Break a leg, Mr. Volare.
- Grazie.

01:03:06.683 --> 01:03:09.311
- Five minutes, Mr. Volare.
- Five minutes?

01:03:09.486 --> 01:03:11.215
Oh, my God.
What have I been doing?

01:03:11.988 --> 01:03:14.821
- Four minutes, Mr. Volare.
- Four minutes?

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:19.557
Three minutes, Mr. Jolson.

01:03:19.729 --> 01:03:21.629
What's going on here?

01:03:22.899 --> 01:03:24.799
Where do you want these,
Mr. Volare?

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:26.629
Anywhere.
Just keep them out of my way.

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:30.500
All right. Come on.
Hurry up. Get out of here.

01:03:30.674 --> 01:03:33.336
Go. Hey, you too. You too. Out.

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:36.308
Where do you want these,
Mr. Volare?

01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:39.876
- What's going on here?!
- How do I know?

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:42.717
Have you lost your mind?

01:03:42.886 --> 01:03:45.821
Lobstergram for Mr. Volare.
Lobstergram! Oh, there you are.

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:49.254
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

01:03:49.426 --> 01:03:52.418
For he's a jolly good fellow

01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:04.236
A masseuse!

01:04:09.746 --> 01:04:10.735
Lazlo!

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:29.423
Mr. Volare is coming.
Places, please.

01:04:35.138 --> 01:04:37.231
T onight is your night, my dear.

01:04:37.407 --> 01:04:39.204
Thanks to you, Edmund.

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:40.741
After the performance,

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:44.368
I will announce you as the sole director
of our ballet company.

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:47.641
If I do say so myself,
the ballet is in good hands.

01:04:47.817 --> 01:04:49.978
How could I ever have
trusted someone

01:04:50.153 --> 01:04:52.553
as nefarious
as Roland Flakfizer?

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:55.816
I don't wish to hear his name
mentioned ever again.

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:44.701
Edmund.

01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:58.944
It's those idiots!

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:00.680
I will put a stop to this.

01:06:05.662 --> 01:06:07.892
Good evening, ballet fans.
We've got a good one.

01:06:08.064 --> 01:06:09.691
Another big-league ballet battle

01:06:09.866 --> 01:06:13.358
starring that plucky
Roberto "Bulldog" Volare.

01:06:13.536 --> 01:06:15.060
And what a great night
for a ballet it is.

01:06:15.238 --> 01:06:17.502
The sky is clear, the wind
is blowing from left to right,

01:06:17.674 --> 01:06:20.336
which means the ballerinas
should be flying out of here.

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:22.876
And here we go. Volare does
a pirouette, another pirouette.

01:06:23.046 --> 01:06:26.379
A skip, a leap. He spins.

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:27.914
He scores!

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:30.382
Listen to that crowd!

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:32.882
- It's him!
- We return you now

01:06:33.056 --> 01:06:34.353
to your regularly scheduled program.

01:06:34.524 --> 01:06:35.513
Come here.

01:06:35.692 --> 01:06:37.216
Get the police now!

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:28.207
Hi.

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:30.872
Get out! Get...

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:33.679
Hold it.

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:08.815
The Great Volare?

01:08:08.985 --> 01:08:11.010
Bon voyage.

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:19.389
No!

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:44.877
- All right, yeah.
- Okay. Here we go.

01:08:53.563 --> 01:08:55.154
- Slam-dunk.
- Yes!

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:58.731
This is an outrage!

01:08:58.901 --> 01:09:00.835
I will not continue
unless you put a stop to this!

01:09:01.004 --> 01:09:01.993
Yes, sir.

01:10:14.911 --> 01:10:17.243
- Spread out. Find them!
- Let's go.

01:10:28.157 --> 01:10:30.148
Don't-- Hey, give me that.

01:10:47.143 --> 01:10:48.735
Get out of here.

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:51.203
Get out.

01:11:01.124 --> 01:11:03.592
Damn. Get off. Off.

01:11:05.628 --> 01:11:06.720
Let's go, this way.

01:11:06.896 --> 01:11:08.989
- This way.
- Ole!

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:27.145
What on earth is happening?

01:11:27.316 --> 01:11:30.376
Edmund. Anyone?

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.218
- You rang?
- Roland, what is happening?

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:34.515
Ballet history.

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:11.715
When do we go on?

01:12:11.894 --> 01:12:14.522
I'd say right about now.

01:12:47.063 --> 01:12:48.724
There they are! Arrest those men!

01:12:48.898 --> 01:12:51.230
- Don't let them get away!
- Oh, boy.

01:12:52.235 --> 01:12:54.965
I will never work for
the Oglethorpe Ballet again!

01:12:55.137 --> 01:12:57.697
- Will you put that in writing?
- This evening could ruin my career!

01:12:57.874 --> 01:12:59.705
At least we're thinking
along the same lines.

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:02.640
I must explain to my public
this is all your doing.

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:16.524
- They're trying to tell you something.
- I quit!

01:13:16.692 --> 01:13:18.125
That's what they're trying to tell you.

01:13:18.794 --> 01:13:21.058
Officers, take these people away.

01:13:21.497 --> 01:13:23.931
Oh, my God, he's got a gun!

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:25.431
The man's insane.

01:13:25.601 --> 01:13:28.161
He could use a gift certificate
to the Betty Ford Center.

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:30.430
We'll have lunch
right after the lobotomy.

01:13:30.606 --> 01:13:33.302
Always remember, nobody likes you.

01:13:56.365 --> 01:13:57.798
Bravo! Bravo!

01:13:57.967 --> 01:14:01.061
Wonderful. Wonderful!
We're a hit!

01:14:01.237 --> 01:14:04.434
Go on, get back out there.
Get back out there.

01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:20.519
- Listen to that crowd!
- You're a ballet legend.

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:25.218
- And you're not even dead yet.
- Oh, Roland, I'm so glad I trusted you.

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:29.228
Rest assured, my darling,
I will never leave your side again.

01:14:39.542 --> 01:14:41.942
What's that? Nothing.

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:48.105
Hey, what happened?

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:56.221
I got an idea.

01:14:56.792 --> 01:14:58.521
Hey, big boy.

01:15:00.696 --> 01:15:02.425
Come here.

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:06.993
Yes. Oh, boy.
