Looks like we're

00:05.547 --> 00:06.966
the only responsible people

00:07.007 --> 00:08.676
who show up on time anymore.

00:08.717 --> 00:10.594
And they're always calling us

00:10.636 --> 00:12.805
-I don't see them.

-They're. Not. Here.

But you know who is?

Hitchcock and Scully.

What are you doing here?

00:17.518 --> 00:19.478
The building's being fumigated.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.896
There were so many emails.

There were?

00:49.550 --> 00:52.344

00:53.929 --> 00:57.140
Oh, Kevin's here.

00:53.929 --> 00:57.140
And you both look so upset.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.934
Oh, no, did they stop

00:58.976 --> 01:00.477
They did, but that doesn't

00:58.976 --> 01:00.477

01:00.519 --> 01:02.521
Nothing does.

01:00.519 --> 01:02.521
Cheddar has been kidnapped.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.398
-Someone took our fluffy boy.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.398
-Oh, my God.

01:04.439 --> 01:05.941
What happened?

01:05.983 --> 01:07.484
Well, Cheddar and I walked

01:05.983 --> 01:07.484
to the bakery together,

01:07.526 --> 01:09.277
we shared a plain scone.

01:07.526 --> 01:09.277
Then we went to the park,

01:09.319 --> 01:10.988
and I let him off leash.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.988
He never came back.

01:11.030 --> 01:13.908
-Someone took our fluffy boy.

01:11.030 --> 01:13.908
-Right, you mentioned that.

01:13.949 --> 01:16.827
Now, just to be clear,

01:13.949 --> 01:16.827
you didn't actually see

01:13.949 --> 01:16.827
someone take him, right?

01:16.869 --> 01:18.620
So there's a chance

01:16.869 --> 01:18.620
Cheddar just ran away.

01:18.662 --> 01:21.248
-You know like some dogs do.

01:18.662 --> 01:21.248
-Cheddar isn't some dog.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.542
He would never do that.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.542
Someone took our--

01:23.584 --> 01:25.126

I need you to

Nothing in the world

01:26.879 --> 01:30.215

01:30.257 --> 01:32.467
I wouldn't say nothing.

For example, you and I

01:32.509 --> 01:34.135
-We don't have time for this.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.135
-Okay.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.137
In kidnappings, the first

01:34.177 --> 01:36.137
48 hours are the most crucial.

01:36.179 --> 01:39.016
-Right, and in dog years,

01:36.179 --> 01:39.016
that's only seven hours.

01:36.179 --> 01:39.016
-Why would you say that?

01:39.058 --> 01:40.642
This is why everyone

01:39.058 --> 01:40.642
prefers that dog to you.

01:46.565 --> 01:48.316
that someone kidnapped Cheddar.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.484
It's a text. It reads,

01:49.526 --> 01:50.652
"I have kidnapped your dog."

01:50.694 --> 01:51.653
I see. Well, that seems

01:51.695 --> 01:52.738
like pretty hard proof.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.971
of the park

05:01.927 --> 05:03.971
over past those trees--

05:04.012 --> 05:05.388
oh, how he loved those trees.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.848
Jake, I don't know

05:05.430 --> 05:06.848
if I can do this.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.558
Yeah, you can do this,

05:06.890 --> 05:08.558
I'm right here with you.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.726
We're gonna get through it

05:08.600 --> 05:09.726
together.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.145
Now let's go.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.145
[coughs]

05:12.729 --> 05:15.607
Oh, hey, Kev, bud,

05:12.729 --> 05:15.607
couldn't help but notice

05:15.649 --> 05:17.276
that when I said, "let's go,"

05:15.649 --> 05:17.276
you didn't go.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.735
You stayed here

05:17.317 --> 05:18.735
and stared at that bench.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.028
Cheddar loved benches.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.780
He'd run up to them.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.780
Sniff their legs.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.115
Paw at them with his--

05:23.157 --> 05:24.741
Paws, sure,

05:23.157 --> 05:24.741
that's what you paw with.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.326
[clears throat] I'm sorry.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.326
This is impossible.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.828
Everything I see

05:26.367 --> 05:27.828
reminds me of Cheddar.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.122
The grass, the asphalt,

05:27.869 --> 05:30.122
squirrels--

05:30.164 --> 05:31.915
-Cheddar loved squirrels.

05:30.164 --> 05:31.915
-Oh, stop.

05:31.957 --> 05:34.334
He loves to chase them.

05:31.957 --> 05:34.334
I suppose I should say loved.

05:34.375 --> 05:35.669
He'd never get there.

05:34.375 --> 05:35.669
He's like--

05:35.710 --> 05:37.462
Eh, Kevin, stop, all right?

05:37.504 --> 05:39.338
We need to get over to that

05:37.504 --> 05:39.338
gate and recreate your morning,

05:39.380 --> 05:40.715
and if seeing all these things

05:39.380 --> 05:40.715
is too much,

05:40.757 --> 05:42.884
-then just focus only on me.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.884
-Okay.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.427
All right,

05:42.926 --> 05:44.427
stare straight into my eyes.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.013
Very good, I will stare

05:44.469 --> 05:46.013
straight into your eyes.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.639
Okay. Oh, wow.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.975
Piercing.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.975
Huh, okay, so let's do this.

05:50.017 --> 05:53.145
And we are headed to the east

05:50.017 --> 05:53.145
gate, we're doing great.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.646
-This is working.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.646
I can do this.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.646
-Here we go.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.064
-I'm doing it.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.064
-You're looking away.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.440
-No, I'm not.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.440
-Stop looking away.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.399
-I'm not.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.399
-Don't look away.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.860
-But I see leaves.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.860
-No!

05:59.901 --> 06:01.069
Cheddar loved playing in leaves.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.237
Didn't matter what kind.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.072
Oak, maple, "el'm."

06:04.114 --> 06:07.575
Wait, I hate to cut you off,

06:04.114 --> 06:07.575
but look what I found.

06:07.617 --> 06:08.702
Security camera.

06:08.743 --> 06:09.828
Cheddar loved

06:08.743 --> 06:09.828
security cameras.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.288
How is that possible?

06:11.330 --> 06:13.581
[Amy]<i> Oh, Rosa,</i>

06:13.623 --> 06:16.877
there she is. The Snoog!

06:16.918 --> 06:19.087
Look at those sexy lines.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.506
Oh, I just wanna get

06:19.129 --> 06:21.506
behind that thing and push.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.966
Aw, man,

06:21.548 --> 06:22.966
you're grossing me out.

06:23.008 --> 06:25.302
[gasps]

06:23.008 --> 06:25.302
What is Teddy doing here?

06:25.344 --> 06:27.386
-Teddy?

06:25.344 --> 06:27.386
-Oh, my gosh, hey Amy.

06:27.428 --> 06:29.014
Right, boring ex-boyfriend

06:27.428 --> 06:29.014
Teddy.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.598
-Hey, Teddy.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.598
-Hey, Rosa.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.142
What are you doing here?

06:30.640 --> 06:32.142
You promised you would stop

06:32.184 --> 06:33.768
showing up places

06:32.184 --> 06:33.768
to propose to me.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.645
Quit flattering yourself.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.645
I only did that four times.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.272
[laughs]

06:35.687 --> 06:37.272
Also, I'm taken now.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.900
I got married, last year,

06:37.314 --> 06:39.900
in the spiciest little city.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.943
Phoenix.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.943
It was very posh.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.486
We served a flight

06:41.985 --> 06:43.486
of large batch Pilsners.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.946
I don't know if you remember,

06:43.528 --> 06:44.946
but I love--

06:44.988 --> 06:46.781
-[all] Pilsners.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.781
-Yeah, we remember.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.575
Yeah, long story short,

06:46.823 --> 06:48.575
we're pregnant now,

06:48.616 --> 06:50.744
and I'ma--I'ma try and win

06:48.616 --> 06:50.744
this sexy little number.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.120
Oh, God, is that

06:50.785 --> 06:52.120
what I sound like?

06:52.162 --> 06:53.372
-Yep.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.372
-Excuse me.

06:53.412 --> 06:54.539
Are you here

06:53.412 --> 06:54.539
for the competition?

06:54.581 --> 06:56.208
Uh, yes, hi.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.208
I'm Teddy Ramos.

06:56.250 --> 06:59.627
Took my wife's last name.

06:56.250 --> 06:59.627
Very brave.

06:59.669 --> 07:00.795
He's the worst.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.339
Hi, I'm Amy Santiago.

07:02.381 --> 07:03.882
I am so sorry,

07:03.924 --> 07:05.926
but pregnant women

07:03.924 --> 07:05.926
aren't allowed to compete.

07:05.967 --> 07:08.095
Not after what happened

07:05.967 --> 07:08.095
last year.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.640
Are you gonna say

07:11.181 --> 07:12.640
what happened?

07:12.682 --> 07:14.017
It's part of the settlement.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.017
We can't.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.310
Okay.

07:15.352 --> 07:18.146
Well, uh, good news:

07:15.352 --> 07:18.146
I'm not pregnant!

07:18.188 --> 07:22.109
-I just had a huge lunch.

07:18.188 --> 07:22.109
-I'm so sorry, I just can't.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.777
All right,

07:22.150 --> 07:23.777
I'll compete for her.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.112
What? You will?

07:25.153 --> 07:26.821
But I know you think

07:25.153 --> 07:26.821
these strollers are dumb.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.907
They are, but I can't let

07:26.863 --> 07:28.907
that boring bastard win.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.576
So we decided to paint

07:28.949 --> 07:31.576
the baby room white.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.245
I mean, you used to have sex

07:31.618 --> 07:33.245
with him.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.454
I know.

07:34.495 --> 07:35.705
[Terry]<i> Charles,</i>

07:35.747 --> 07:37.916
this Boyle bone broth

07:35.747 --> 07:37.916
is incredible!

07:37.958 --> 07:40.710
-I'm not sore at all anymore.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.710
-I told you it works.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.963
The Boyles used to drink it

07:40.752 --> 07:42.963
during potato digging season

07:43.004 --> 07:44.464
to keep everyone healthy

07:43.004 --> 07:44.464
in the furrows.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.674
You know, I bet we could sell

07:44.505 --> 07:46.674
this stuff.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.509
You really think so?

07:46.716 --> 07:48.509
[gasps]

07:48.551 --> 07:49.719
We can call our company

07:48.551 --> 07:49.719
"The Bone Boys."

07:49.761 --> 07:51.763
No! "More Bone, Less Moan."

07:51.805 --> 07:53.890
No! "Workplace Bone Buds."

07:53.932 --> 07:55.183
That's the one.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.183
I'm registering it.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.935
Ewh, we can name

07:55.225 --> 07:56.935
the company later.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.979
Anyway, I know just who

07:56.977 --> 07:58.979
to pitch this to.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.398
My buddy who invented

07:59.020 --> 08:01.398
Muscle Malt.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.649
[gasps]

08:01.440 --> 08:02.649
This is great!

08:02.690 --> 08:04.151
We're the perfect partners.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.652
When it comes to cooking,

08:04.192 --> 08:05.652
you got me.

08:05.693 --> 08:07.946
When it comes to being ripped,

08:05.693 --> 08:07.946
you also have me.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.364
And you have

08:07.988 --> 08:09.364
a little connection.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.658
We're gonna be rich.

08:11.699 --> 08:12.784
Sir, we're back.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.411
Find anything

08:12.826 --> 08:14.411
in the case files?

08:14.453 --> 08:16.330
Yes, most of them were

08:14.453 --> 08:16.330
useless, but one caught my eye.

08:16.371 --> 08:19.749
On May 15th, 2004 detectives

08:16.371 --> 08:19.749
arrested Frank Kingston,

08:19.791 --> 08:21.209
leader of the 16th Street Gang.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.544
Thanks to the testimony

08:21.251 --> 08:23.544
of confidential informant,

08:23.586 --> 08:27.090
Kingston served 16 years.

08:23.586 --> 08:27.090
He just got out last month.

08:27.132 --> 08:28.883
And you think he wants

08:27.132 --> 08:28.883
the file to figure out

08:28.925 --> 08:30.760
which one of his guys

08:28.925 --> 08:30.760
turned on him to get revenge.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.762
-It's a Vendetta.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.762
-[Italian accent] Vendetta.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.306
Sure.

08:34.348 --> 08:36.766
So now I know who the

08:34.348 --> 08:36.766
sumbitch is who took my dog.

08:36.808 --> 08:40.020
The only problem is,

08:36.808 --> 08:40.020
I have no idea where

08:36.808 --> 08:40.020
to find that sumbitch.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.980
Well, Raymond, I think we can

08:40.061 --> 08:41.980
help you find that sumbitch.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.940
-Jake?

08:42.022 --> 08:43.940
-Sumbitch. We all

08:42.022 --> 08:43.940
got to say it.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.985
Let me show you what we found:

08:43.982 --> 08:46.985
A security camera grabbed

08:47.027 --> 08:49.154
some footage of Cheddar being

08:47.027 --> 08:49.154
picked up and put into a car

08:49.196 --> 08:52.615
which was registered to an

08:49.196 --> 08:52.615
anonymous shell company

08:49.196 --> 08:52.615
on Dean Street.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.034
We can be there in 15 minutes.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.910
That's weird.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.910
It's sunny outside.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.787
Why's that weird?

08:57.829 --> 09:00.915
Because a [bleep] storm is about

08:57.829 --> 09:00.915
to rain down on that punk.

09:00.957 --> 09:03.835
Oh, my God, I fell for it,

09:00.957 --> 09:03.835
and I loved it.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.546
All right, let's gear up. Kevin,

09:03.877 --> 09:06.546
you stay here, and don't worry.

09:06.587 --> 09:08.089
We're gonna get your dog back.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.384
So we did not

09:08.131 --> 09:10.384
get your dog back.

09:10.425 --> 09:13.178
Unfortunately, he wasn't here.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.929
No, no, no. I think Captain

09:13.220 --> 09:14.929
Holt's taking it really well.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.348
[Holt screams]

09:16.390 --> 09:17.724
So we'll see you soon.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.393
[contest judge]<i> Wow, five hours.</i>

09:19.434 --> 09:21.228
This is the most exciting

09:19.434 --> 09:21.228
contest we've had.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.021
Of course, the incident

09:21.269 --> 09:23.021
last year was exciting,

09:23.063 --> 09:26.066
but we all know how that ended.

09:23.063 --> 09:26.066
[inhales]

09:26.107 --> 09:27.401
No, we don't.

09:27.442 --> 09:28.860
Right.

09:27.442 --> 09:28.860
Because of the gag order.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.237
[groans]

09:30.278 --> 09:31.905
Are you sure you wanna

09:30.278 --> 09:31.905
keep doing this, Rosa?

09:31.946 --> 09:33.573
You really don't have to.

09:33.614 --> 09:35.575
My feet hurt a little, but

09:33.614 --> 09:35.575
I can go as long as it takes.

09:35.616 --> 09:36.993
We're having a great time

09:35.616 --> 09:36.993
back here.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.119
I was just telling

09:37.035 --> 09:38.119
my buddy Reggie here

09:38.161 --> 09:39.329
about this great salsa

09:38.161 --> 09:39.329
that I make.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.788
It's so mild

09:39.371 --> 09:40.788
you barely taste it.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.457
That's it.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.457
I can't take any more.

09:42.499 --> 09:43.917
-I'm out.

09:42.499 --> 09:43.917
-Bye, Reggie.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.502
I'll send you that article

09:43.958 --> 09:45.502
about mailboxes.

09:45.544 --> 09:47.045
-[Reggie] Please don't!

09:45.544 --> 09:47.045
-Oh, my God,

09:47.087 --> 09:49.548
Teddy is boring people

09:47.087 --> 09:49.548
out of the competition,

09:49.589 --> 09:52.717
and he doesn't even realize it.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.717
Can't let him get to you, Rosa.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.386
It's fine, I can handle boring.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.386
We're friends.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.179
Ooh, guys,

09:54.428 --> 09:56.179
you will never believe

09:56.221 --> 09:59.391
who I saw at Bush Gardens last

09:56.221 --> 09:59.391
summer: my neighbor.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.351
Yeah?

09:59.433 --> 10:01.351
Just walking around.

10:01.393 --> 10:03.811
The kidnapper said he would

10:01.393 --> 10:03.811
call with drop instructions

10:03.853 --> 10:06.856
at 8:00 a.m.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.856
It is now [sighs] 8:01.

10:06.898 --> 10:08.316
Cheddar's dead.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.110
Cheddar is not dead.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.110
It's just one minute.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.445
Perhaps the kidnapper's

10:10.151 --> 10:11.445
watch is slow.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.363
Oh, dear God,

10:11.486 --> 10:13.363
if his watch is slow,

10:13.405 --> 10:15.365
there's no telling what else

10:13.405 --> 10:15.365
this psychopath is capable of.

10:15.407 --> 10:18.034
[Kevin] Raymond, Cheddar is

10:15.407 --> 10:18.034
fine. He's coming back to us,

10:18.076 --> 10:20.912
and that is why I bought a new

10:18.076 --> 10:20.912
GPS tag to put on his collar.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.997
Thank you, Kevin.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.997
At least some of us

10:20.954 --> 10:22.997
are thinking clearly.

10:23.039 --> 10:26.209
Yes, crystal clear.

10:23.039 --> 10:26.209
In fact I bought 5 GPS tags.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.378
One for his collar

10:26.251 --> 10:28.378
and one for each arm and leg.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.130
I'm going to make bracelets

10:28.420 --> 10:30.130
to put them on,

10:30.171 --> 10:32.549
and I'll never lose

10:30.171 --> 10:32.549
my Cheddar again.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.342
Okay, a little unsettling,

10:32.591 --> 10:34.342
but I like your positivity.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.052
[phone buzzing]

10:34.384 --> 10:36.052
Three minutes after 8:00.

10:36.094 --> 10:37.804
This man is unhinged.

10:37.845 --> 10:39.889
-You said you'd call at 8:00.

10:37.845 --> 10:39.889

10:44.478 --> 10:46.229

10:46.271 --> 10:47.855
I'm not involving him in this.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.855
I'll bring them myself.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.363
-[line disconnects]

10:52.652 --> 10:55.363
-Clearly, we're not doing this.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.824
No, it's fine. We can just alter

10:55.405 --> 10:57.824
the files and give him fakes.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.284
-He'll never know.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.284
-It's not that.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.202
It's that I refuse to put

10:59.326 --> 11:01.202
Kevin in harm's way.

11:01.244 --> 11:04.038
Understood, but I think

11:01.244 --> 11:04.038
maybe I have a way

11:04.080 --> 11:05.748
to put Kevin in danger

11:05.790 --> 11:07.167
without putting Kevin in danger.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.751
[impersonating]

11:07.208 --> 11:08.751
Well, hello there Raymond.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.295
It's me, Kevin!

11:10.337 --> 11:12.172
[flatly] And I am

11:10.337 --> 11:12.172
Detective Jacob Peralta.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.299
We didn't have anything else

11:12.213 --> 11:14.299
to wear so we just switched.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.217
He understands.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.431
Okay, if we're gonna pull

11:18.970 --> 11:21.431
this off,

11:21.473 --> 11:23.183
we need to teach you

11:21.473 --> 11:23.183
how to move,

11:23.224 --> 11:25.560
talk, and act

11:23.224 --> 11:25.560
exactly like Kevin.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.770
In other words we have

11:25.602 --> 11:27.770
a "Pygmalion" situation.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.231
Exactly, a "pig mailman"

11:27.812 --> 11:30.231
situation.

11:30.273 --> 11:31.566
-Raymond.

11:30.273 --> 11:31.566
-It'll be okay.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.193
-What'll be okay?

11:31.608 --> 11:33.193
-Let's get started.

11:33.234 --> 11:35.028
-Yesh, let's get shtarted!

11:33.234 --> 11:35.028
-It's getting worse.

11:35.069 --> 11:36.363
Spot on, Kevin.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.697
Look, Raymond.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.697
A yellow crested warbler.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.908
Look, Raymond.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.908
A yellow crested warbler.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.411
No, you're too excited.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.411
The warbler's a common bird.

11:43.453 --> 11:44.912
-Ah.

11:43.453 --> 11:44.912
-And then I said,

11:44.954 --> 11:47.415
"Which 'Metamorphosis'?

11:44.954 --> 11:47.415
Kafka or Ovid?"

11:47.457 --> 11:49.417
He loves it.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.169
-He loves it.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.169
-[Holt sighs]

11:51.211 --> 11:52.546
So that's the joke.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.546
Now, you tell it.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.297
Oh, okay,

11:52.587 --> 11:54.297
[clears throat]

11:54.339 --> 11:56.341
so a professor walks in

11:54.339 --> 11:56.341
to a rare books collection--

11:56.383 --> 11:58.635
No, you've ruined it.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.635
Now it's not funny.

11:58.677 --> 12:00.803
Look, Raymond.

11:58.677 --> 12:00.803
A yellow crested warbler.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.306
Look, Raymond.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.306
A yellow crested warbler.

12:03.348 --> 12:04.974
Ugh, not excited enough.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.809
They may be common,

12:05.016 --> 12:06.809
but they're still birds.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.353
At the 92nd Street Y,

12:08.395 --> 12:10.271
I had a wonderful symposium

12:08.395 --> 12:10.271
on just that topic.

12:10.313 --> 12:11.939
That's it.

12:10.313 --> 12:11.939
You're getting it.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.525
Ah, cool, cool, cool,

12:11.981 --> 12:13.525
cool, cool, cool, cool.

12:13.567 --> 12:16.152
Don't say "cool,"

12:13.567 --> 12:16.152
instead, say "indeed."

12:16.194 --> 12:17.820
Oh, indeed, indeed,

12:16.194 --> 12:17.820
indeed, indeed, indeed.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.780
[laughs]

12:17.862 --> 12:19.780
It's weird.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.158
Look, Raymond.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.158
A yellow crested warbler.

12:22.200 --> 12:25.828
Yes! That's the right level

12:22.200 --> 12:25.828
of excitement for such a bird.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.955
You captured the

12:25.870 --> 12:27.955
essence of Kevin.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.249
You've done it.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.125
Correction,

12:29.290 --> 12:31.125
I've accomplished it.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.711
-Indeed.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.212
Indeed, indeed, indeed...

12:34.254 --> 12:35.838
all: Indeed, indeed, indeed,

12:34.254 --> 12:35.838
indeed, indeed.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.215
It's growing on me.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.093
Oh, my God,

12:38.592 --> 12:40.093
Rosa.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.969
I can't believe

12:40.134 --> 12:41.969
you're still here.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.971
And I can't believe Teddy

12:42.011 --> 12:43.971
looks so normal.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.223
I'm 'onna win you that Snoo.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.223
Slog.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.433
Snat--whatever,

12:45.265 --> 12:46.433
my brain is broken,

12:46.474 --> 12:48.184
I haven't slept in 72 hours.

12:48.226 --> 12:49.936
You've only been doing

12:48.226 --> 12:49.936
the competition for one night.

12:49.977 --> 12:51.812
I mean, you're allowed

12:49.977 --> 12:51.812
to not sleep for other reasons.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.733
-Okay, I got you a coffee.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.733
-Oh, thank you.

12:54.773 --> 12:57.818
Just need to put my left hand

12:54.773 --> 12:57.818
on the stroller.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.321
My right hand grabs the cup.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.321
My mouth do the sippin'.

13:00.363 --> 13:02.156
What's... happening?

13:02.198 --> 13:04.909
My broken brain won't talk

13:02.198 --> 13:04.909
to my body, so I'm doing it.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.077
Blink.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.370
Rosa, you don't

13:06.119 --> 13:07.370
have to do this.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.955
-You can stop.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.955
-Snarl at Amy. [snarls]

13:08.996 --> 13:10.498
Teddy and I are

13:08.996 --> 13:10.498
the only ones left.

13:10.540 --> 13:11.790

light rail systems.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.044
Ooh, you should ride the one

13:13.376 --> 13:15.044
in Akron, by the way.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.546
-Very little noise.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.546
-Oh, my God.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.465
Enough about light rails.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.465
Let's talk trams.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.924
-Amusement parks get it.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.924
-I can't, I can't, I can't...

Oh no, wait, Rosa!

13:25.513 --> 13:27.140
Hands are off.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.140
We have a winner!

13:27.181 --> 13:28.433
-Me?

13:28.475 --> 13:30.602
I won the stroller?

Whoo-hoo!

13:30.644 --> 13:32.979
-[Teddy laughs]

13:30.644 --> 13:32.979
-Oh, I see what I did wrong.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.564
It's okay.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.564
Come on, let's get you home.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.149
Excuse me.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.149
Amy.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.485
You can have the stroller

13:36.190 --> 13:38.485
for the right price.

13:38.526 --> 13:39.860
Okay, how much?

13:41.946 --> 13:43.323
Amy Santiago,

13:41.946 --> 13:43.323
will you marry me?

13:43.364 --> 13:44.741
No!

13:44.783 --> 13:46.367
Okay, I'm approaching

13:44.783 --> 13:46.367
the drop site.

13:46.409 --> 13:47.619
I don't see anything unusual.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.078
We have eyes on you.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.372
-Just be natural.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.372
<i>-Indeed, I will.</i>

13:51.414 --> 13:53.916
Oh, look,

13:51.414 --> 13:53.916
a yellow crested warbler.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.418
-Very good.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.418
-[phone ringing]

13:55.460 --> 13:56.835
He's calling.

13:55.460 --> 13:56.835
Wait, Kevin,

13:56.877 --> 13:58.296
we didn't go over

13:56.877 --> 13:58.296
how you answer the phone.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.047
[Holt]<i> There isn't time.</i>

13:58.338 --> 14:00.047
<i>Just answer.</i>

14:00.089 --> 14:01.424
Okay.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.092
You've reached

14:01.466 --> 14:03.092
Professor Kevin Cozner.

14:03.134 --> 14:05.553
Please start speaking when

14:03.134 --> 14:05.553
I finish this sentence.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.224
He hung up.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.393
And he had me pick up a copy

14:10.266 --> 14:12.393
of<i> The Tempest.</i>

14:12.435 --> 14:14.853
Oh, no, Raymond. Do you

14:12.435 --> 14:14.853
know what's happening

14:12.435 --> 14:14.853
in the park today?

14:14.895 --> 14:18.441
-The Shakespeare Festival

14:14.895 --> 14:18.441
which will be attended by--

14:14.895 --> 14:18.441
-[Jake]<i> Guys,</i>

14:18.483 --> 14:20.276
I'm in a sea of Kevins.

14:21.986 --> 14:25.072
Okay, between us,

14:21.986 --> 14:25.072
I think we made enough broth.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.616
Did you edit the presentation

14:25.114 --> 14:26.616
like I asked?

14:26.658 --> 14:27.908
You mean did I remove

14:27.950 --> 14:29.494
the tasteful photos

14:27.950 --> 14:29.494
of me stretching?

14:29.536 --> 14:32.205
They weren't tasteful!

14:29.536 --> 14:32.205
You were in a thong.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.040
[phone vibrates]

14:34.081 --> 14:36.459
All right, Muscle Malt Kenneth

14:34.081 --> 14:36.459
is on his way up.

14:36.501 --> 14:39.879
Hey, I just wanna say,

14:36.501 --> 14:39.879
no matter how this turns out,

14:39.920 --> 14:41.548
it was really fun

14:39.920 --> 14:41.548
working on this with you.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.466
Aw, Terry,

14:41.589 --> 14:43.466
it's gotta turn out well.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.301
I invested $11,000 in it.

14:45.343 --> 14:46.594
$11,000?!

14:46.636 --> 14:48.929
It only costs 30 bucks

14:46.636 --> 14:48.929
to make the broth!

14:48.971 --> 14:51.891
Yeah, but it cost $11,000

14:48.971 --> 14:51.891
to buy the domain name

14:51.932 --> 14:54.143
"workplacebonebuds.com."

14:51.932 --> 14:54.143
I am all in.

14:54.185 --> 14:56.604
Boyle, why in the world

14:54.185 --> 14:56.604
would you do that?

14:56.646 --> 14:59.482
You are such a--

14:56.646 --> 14:59.482
an amazing business partner.

14:59.524 --> 15:02.151
Kenneth, I'd like you to meet

14:59.524 --> 15:02.151
my amazing business partner,

14:59.524 --> 15:02.151
Charles.

15:02.193 --> 15:04.195
-Hey.

15:02.193 --> 15:04.195
-Hello.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.447
-I'm excited to see what

15:04.237 --> 15:06.447
you guys have here.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.447
-Well then, take a sip

15:06.489 --> 15:09.283
and feel the soreness

15:06.489 --> 15:09.283
start to drain away.

15:11.619 --> 15:12.995
Mmm.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.664
It's good.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.664
Very tasty.

15:14.706 --> 15:17.458
Not only is it delicious,

15:14.706 --> 15:17.458
it's high in amino acids,

15:17.500 --> 15:18.877
and low in sodium.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.169
Well, not exactly

15:18.918 --> 15:20.169
low in sodium.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.921
It definitely has salt in it.

15:21.962 --> 15:23.882
Not in the batch I made.

15:21.962 --> 15:23.882
I left it out.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.633
Terry doesn't like

15:23.923 --> 15:25.633
to get all bloaty.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.927
You left out the salt?

15:25.675 --> 15:27.927
That stops the fermentation.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.178
The salt keeps it stable.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.180
Oh, ah!

15:29.220 --> 15:31.180
God, what is happening?

15:31.222 --> 15:33.099
They're all gonna blow!

15:31.222 --> 15:33.099
Take cover!

15:37.854 --> 15:39.606
So, uh, do we have a deal?

15:39.647 --> 15:41.065
[all shout]

15:41.107 --> 15:42.609
<i>Still waiting</i>

15:41.107 --> 15:42.609
<i>for instructions, over.</i>

15:42.650 --> 15:44.235
[Holt] Wait, we don't

15:42.650 --> 15:44.235
have eyes on you.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.112
-Kevin, do you see Jake?

15:44.277 --> 15:46.112
-Yes, he's right there.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.822
Oh, no, that's

15:46.153 --> 15:47.822
a different gentlemen

15:47.864 --> 15:49.407
wearing a handsome jacket.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.407
Everyone is so well dressed.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.200
Peralta, head for

15:49.449 --> 15:51.200
the north gate.

15:51.242 --> 15:52.619
<i>We're having trouble</i>

15:51.242 --> 15:52.619
<i>finding you.</i>

15:52.660 --> 15:54.036
All right, Professor,

15:54.078 --> 15:55.580
I'm assuming you're

15:54.078 --> 15:55.580
wearing a wire.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.123
A what? A--huh?

15:57.164 --> 15:58.458
Ah, yes, a wire.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.042
My husband asked me

15:58.499 --> 16:00.042
to wear that.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.169
We lost comms.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.169
Something happened.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.632
Cheddar!

16:03.630 --> 16:05.632
Uh, my fluffy boy!

16:05.673 --> 16:07.425
I've missed you so.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.760
All right, put up your hands.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.760
I'm gonna tap you down.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.010
There's no need for that.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.512
Here, I have the drive.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.512
Just take it.

16:11.554 --> 16:12.931
Thanks.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.474
I'm still gonna pat you down.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.976
Be my guest, but you're not

16:14.515 --> 16:16.976
gonna find anything.

16:17.017 --> 16:20.146
-Here's a gun.

16:17.017 --> 16:20.146
-Whoops.

16:20.187 --> 16:22.273
And another gun.

16:20.187 --> 16:22.273
I forgot about that one too.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.400
So, the Professor's got

16:22.315 --> 16:24.400
two guns on him,

16:24.442 --> 16:26.193
and he's wearing a fake beard.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.404
Oh, please don't rip it off.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.404
It hurts so much.

16:28.446 --> 16:29.906
I think the Professor's

16:28.446 --> 16:29.906
actually a cop.

16:29.948 --> 16:32.032
Something tells me I

16:29.948 --> 16:32.032
should check that drive.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.409
There's a laptop in

16:32.074 --> 16:33.409
the front seat. Get it.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.119
If these files aren't

16:33.451 --> 16:35.119
the real deal,

16:35.161 --> 16:36.412
you and the dog are dead.

16:36.454 --> 16:38.372
Oh, no need to worry.

16:36.454 --> 16:38.372
Because everything

16:38.414 --> 16:40.207
is on the level

16:38.414 --> 16:40.207
and will be completely fine.

16:40.249 --> 16:43.127
Cheddar, go!

16:40.249 --> 16:43.127
Go, boy!

16:43.169 --> 16:44.879
Hey cop.

16:46.631 --> 16:50.050
Would you like

16:46.631 --> 16:50.050
to buy a laptop?

16:50.092 --> 16:53.262
There's no sign of Peralta

16:50.092 --> 16:53.262
out here. Did you hear anything

16:50.092 --> 16:53.262
on the wire?

16:53.304 --> 16:54.764
No, it never came back on.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.764
Do you think he's okay?

16:54.806 --> 16:56.056
-Shh!

16:54.806 --> 16:56.056
-What?

16:56.098 --> 16:58.100
-Do you hear it?

16:56.098 --> 16:58.100
-Yes, I do.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.519
That's the jingle

16:58.142 --> 16:59.519
of Cheddar's collar.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.103
[barks]

16:59.560 --> 17:01.103
And that's his bark!

17:01.145 --> 17:04.148
<i>[triumphant music]</i>

17:04.190 --> 17:06.526
Oh, it's our fluffy boy!

17:06.567 --> 17:09.946
Good dog.

17:09.988 --> 17:12.406
-Oh, Mr. Cheddar,

17:09.988 --> 17:12.406
how I've missed you.

17:09.988 --> 17:12.406
-We both have.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.784
I'm putting that GPS tag

17:12.448 --> 17:14.784
on your collar immediately.

17:14.826 --> 17:17.286
Oh, damn it, it's not here.

17:14.826 --> 17:17.286
I'm wearing Peralta's pants.

17:17.328 --> 17:18.955
Ugh,

17:17.328 --> 17:18.955
and now my hands are sticky.

17:18.997 --> 17:21.875
Wait, so Peralta's wearing

17:18.997 --> 17:21.875
your pants which means--

17:21.916 --> 17:23.751
-He doesn't have sticky hands.

17:21.916 --> 17:23.751
-Yes, but also...

17:23.793 --> 17:26.253
-...he has the GPS tracker.

17:23.793 --> 17:26.253
-[gasps]

17:27.087 --> 17:28.255
[Amy] Hey,

17:28.297 --> 17:29.507
so, given the fact that you

17:29.549 --> 17:30.675
haven't slept in forever,

17:30.717 --> 17:32.176
I feel like I should

17:30.717 --> 17:32.176
drive you home.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.720
I'm not going home.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.720
I'm going out.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.680
What? Really?

17:33.761 --> 17:35.680
What is your life?

17:35.722 --> 17:36.806
It's pretty good actually.

17:36.848 --> 17:38.349
-Huh.

17:36.848 --> 17:38.349
-By the way,

17:38.391 --> 17:39.893
I'm sorry that I didn't win you

17:38.391 --> 17:39.893
that stroller.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.603
No, no, no, you were right.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.603
I don't need a Snoog.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.146
It's way too fancy.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.606
-It is stupid.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.606
-It's not stupid.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.191
I said you didn't need it

17:47.233 --> 17:49.151
because I already bought

17:47.233 --> 17:49.151
you a stroller for your shower

17:49.193 --> 17:50.528
this weekend, it's just--

17:49.193 --> 17:50.528
isn't as fancy, and I felt bad.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.698
Rosa, I would love any

17:50.570 --> 17:53.698
stroller you got me

17:53.740 --> 17:54.699
because it came from you.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.158
It's a Luftroller.

17:57.744 --> 18:01.288
Oh, that is--

17:57.744 --> 18:01.288
that is a great stroller.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.290
-I got you a gift receipt.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.290
-Thank you so much.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.125
I cleaned up

18:03.332 --> 18:05.125
as much as I could,

18:05.167 --> 18:06.502
but I think that couch

18:06.544 --> 18:08.087
is gonna smell like bone broth

18:06.544 --> 18:08.087
for a while.

18:08.128 --> 18:09.630
So did you talk to your friend?

18:09.672 --> 18:11.674
Any chance he'll

18:09.672 --> 18:11.674
reconsider investing?

18:11.716 --> 18:13.342
Yeah, that's not happening.

18:13.384 --> 18:15.678
He said that was the

18:13.384 --> 18:15.678
most scared he's ever been,

18:15.720 --> 18:17.304
and he was on that plane

18:15.720 --> 18:17.304
that landed on the Hudson.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.723
I guess that's it.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.768
I'm never gonna make

18:18.765 --> 18:21.768
my $11,000 back.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.686
Actually, I called

18:21.809 --> 18:23.686
another guy from my gym.

18:23.728 --> 18:25.104
He wants to buy the domain

18:25.145 --> 18:26.773
workplacebonebuds.com

18:25.145 --> 18:26.773
off of you.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.148
That's amazing!

18:28.190 --> 18:29.734
I can't believe you

18:28.190 --> 18:29.734
found someone else

18:29.776 --> 18:32.194
who runs a bone broth

18:29.776 --> 18:32.194
company with a coworker.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.780
What are the odds?

18:33.821 --> 18:35.740
No, obviously he wants

18:33.821 --> 18:35.740
to make a website

18:35.782 --> 18:37.909
that helps people hook up

18:35.782 --> 18:37.909
with their coworkers.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.869
-I don't see it.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.869
-Charles.

18:39.911 --> 18:42.246
It's called

18:39.911 --> 18:42.246
workplacebonebuds.com.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.748
All I hear is

18:42.288 --> 18:43.748
friendship and broth.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.625
But yeah, I mean he wants

18:43.790 --> 18:45.625
to burn his money,

18:45.666 --> 18:48.335
I'll light the match. Yeah,

18:45.666 --> 18:48.335
tell him to call me. His loss.

18:48.377 --> 18:49.879
[Jake] So what's your

18:48.377 --> 18:49.879
plan here, Kingston?

18:49.921 --> 18:51.338
You gonna torture me?

18:51.380 --> 18:53.716
You gonna put my beard back on

18:51.380 --> 18:53.716
and rip it off again?

18:53.758 --> 18:55.301
No, I'm gonna cut off

18:53.758 --> 18:55.301
each one of your fingers

18:55.342 --> 18:56.803
until you tell me

18:55.342 --> 18:56.803
who the rat is.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.471
I see. Well that's bad news,

18:58.512 --> 19:00.347
because I don't know

18:58.512 --> 19:00.347
who the rat is,

19:00.389 --> 19:02.100
and I need all my fingers

19:00.389 --> 19:02.100
if I'm gonna beat Wario.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.268
-You can't beat Wario?

19:02.141 --> 19:04.268
-You can? How do you do it?

19:04.310 --> 19:05.979
It's simple. When he's

19:04.310 --> 19:05.979
approaching, you just tap the--

19:06.020 --> 19:07.563
-[alarm blares]

19:06.020 --> 19:07.563
-Damn it!

19:07.605 --> 19:09.231
Motion detector!

19:07.605 --> 19:09.231
I'm sorry, what do you tap?

19:09.273 --> 19:11.400
-Get up, let's go!

19:09.273 --> 19:11.400
-Kingston!

19:11.442 --> 19:13.653
What do you tap?

19:11.442 --> 19:13.653
What do you tap?!

19:14.904 --> 19:16.572
NYPD! NYPD!

19:16.614 --> 19:19.033
Split up!

19:16.614 --> 19:19.033
Cover the exits!

19:21.160 --> 19:22.620
-Freeze!

19:21.160 --> 19:22.620
-Captain!

19:22.662 --> 19:25.081
-Captain!

19:22.662 --> 19:25.081
-He's not getting away!

19:25.123 --> 19:28.250
-He took my dog!

19:25.123 --> 19:28.250
-[Jake] Oh, my God.

19:28.292 --> 19:29.502
It's happening!

19:30.294 --> 19:32.130
[grunting]

19:34.381 --> 19:36.759
[tires squealing]

19:37.635 --> 19:40.096
-[tires screech]

19:37.635 --> 19:40.096
-Aah!

19:44.934 --> 19:45.977
Oh, I see you have a knife.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.395
But what you need

19:46.019 --> 19:48.395
is an umbrella.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.397
Tell him why.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.397
Tell him why!

19:50.439 --> 19:55.361
'Cause there's a [bleep] storm

19:50.439 --> 19:55.361
gonna rain down on you, punk.

19:55.402 --> 19:58.114
[both shouting]

19:58.156 --> 20:00.908
[both grunting]

20:02.409 --> 20:04.162
Ooh.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.458
My goodness.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.261
-Awh!

20:19.301 --> 20:21.261
-Ooo-hoo-hoo!

20:31.271 --> 20:36.443
You took the

20:31.271 --> 20:36.443
wrong fluffy boy!

20:37.695 --> 20:39.780
[approaching sirens]

20:41.115 --> 20:42.909
[Holt] He's done. Cuff him.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.077
Yes, sir.

20:44.118 --> 20:45.745
[Jake gasps]

20:45.786 --> 20:49.289
That was the single coolest

20:45.786 --> 20:49.289
thing that has ever happened.

20:49.331 --> 20:50.875
Relax, Peralta.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.334
That wasn't even the coolest

20:50.917 --> 20:52.334
thing I've ever done.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.794
What have you done

20:52.376 --> 20:53.794
that's cooler?

20:53.836 --> 20:55.713
It was the '80s.

20:53.836 --> 20:55.713
It was nothing, I mean,

20:55.755 --> 20:57.048
they made a movie out of it,

20:55.755 --> 20:57.048
but whatever.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.382
What?

20:57.090 --> 20:58.382
What movie?

20:58.424 --> 20:59.884
I don't remember the title.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.928
Uh, there was a crime

20:59.926 --> 21:01.928
on a plane, I was a passenger.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.471
-Was it<i> Passenger 57</i> ?

21:01.969 --> 21:04.471
-I honestly don't know.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.224
It had to have been.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.224
Just say it was that.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.975
You know, Peralta, sometimes

21:06.265 --> 21:07.975
I don't understand

21:08.017 --> 21:09.852
the words coming out

21:08.017 --> 21:09.852
of your mouth.

21:09.894 --> 21:11.270
Oh, my God, was it<i> Rush Hour</i> ?

21:11.311 --> 21:12.730
What? No.

21:11.311 --> 21:12.730
You know what?

21:12.772 --> 21:14.314
I'm too old for this crap.

21:14.356 --> 21:19.319
It was<i> Lethal Weapon</i> ?!

21:14.356 --> 21:19.319
Sir, are you Murtaugh?!

21:20.696 --> 21:22.156
Does that make me Riggs?

21:23.532 --> 21:25.201
I'm Riggs!

21:25.243 --> 21:27.078
<i>Fremulon.</i>

21:27.120 --> 21:29.496
<i>-Not a doctor.</i>

21:27.120 --> 21:29.496
<i>-Shh.</i>
