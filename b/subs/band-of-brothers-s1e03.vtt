I thought I was going
to get killed instantly.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.075
I thought one
of two things:

02:39.158 --> 02:42.620
A quick death or...

02:42.704 --> 02:44.914
I'd come through probably
without a scratch.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.875
I think everybody
had fear.

02:46.958 --> 02:51.421
I think there's people
that can handle fear.

02:51.504 --> 02:52.964
I think, uh...

02:53.965 --> 02:55.174
I think I was
probably one of them.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.676
I think I was
just as...

02:57.802 --> 03:00.305
scared as anybody else,
except I could think.

03:00.388 --> 03:04.017
It's a feeling you would
not let yourself down...

03:05.435 --> 03:09.856
and you would not
let your comrades
or your unit down.

03:09.939 --> 03:11.900
We all had fear...

03:11.983 --> 03:15.194
but we all had
training to know that...

03:16.279 --> 03:18.114
you try to handle
your fear

03:18.197 --> 03:20.408

17:06.942 --> 17:09.069
Go!

17:09.153 --> 17:11.780
Man: Get out of the street!

17:09.153 --> 17:11.780
Get the hell out of there.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.241
They got us zeroed!

17:17.161 --> 17:18.412
Get out
of there!

17:18.495 --> 17:19.329
Go, go!

17:19.413 --> 17:21.498
Get the hell
out of the street!

17:21.582 --> 17:22.541
Move, now.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.209
Let's go, go, go!

17:28.047 --> 17:29.715
Man over here!

17:36.847 --> 17:40.017
(explosions continue)

17:50.027 --> 17:51.069
Man: Medic!

17:55.115 --> 17:57.034
(shouting)

18:02.623 --> 18:04.333
(moaning)

18:07.044 --> 18:09.171
Come on, let's get you
out of here.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.839
Come on, boy.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.676
Come on.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.221
Move, move, move!

18:17.304 --> 18:18.847
Get off
the street!

18:18.931 --> 18:20.015
Go, go!

18:18.931 --> 18:20.015
Fire!

18:20.098 --> 18:21.642
Move, now!

18:27.773 --> 18:29.066
Talbert: Lip!

18:33.737 --> 18:34.988
Hey, buddy.

18:43.705 --> 18:44.790
You're okay, Lip.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.750
Everything's right
where it should be.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.795
Come on,
upsy-daisy.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.507
Let's get those guns!

18:53.590 --> 18:55.968
Man:
Get Tipper up here
with the bazooka.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.202
Hello?

19:22.286 --> 19:23.704
Anybody there?

19:37.342 --> 19:39.344
(breathing hard)

19:37.342 --> 19:39.344
(Liebgott, muffled)
Tipper!

19:39.428 --> 19:40.470
Tip!

19:41.680 --> 19:43.098
Tipper!

19:43.182 --> 19:45.434
Answer me, Tip!

19:47.644 --> 19:49.021
Hey.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.814
Joe?

19:49.104 --> 19:50.814
Looking good, Tip.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.650
Is that you?

19:50.898 --> 19:53.650
Looking real good.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.360
Come here, buddy,
you gotta sit down.

19:55.444 --> 19:56.737
Come here,
come on.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.280
Easy, easy.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.073
There you go,
there you go.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.664
Ah, Jesus.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.258
You hang in there,
buddy.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.636
Okay? We're gonna
get you fixed up.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.721
All right? Okay.

20:22.804 --> 20:25.223
Guys, you wanna
give me a hand here?
Come on.

20:26.475 --> 20:27.392
(praying)

20:27.476 --> 20:28.810
Take the left flank!

20:28.894 --> 20:30.479
Take the left flank!

20:32.105 --> 20:34.024
(men shouting)

20:40.489 --> 20:41.782
In the name of the Father
and of the Son

20:41.865 --> 20:43.075
and the Holy Spirit.

20:41.865 --> 20:43.075
Hey, Malark.

20:43.158 --> 20:44.201
You see what
I'm seeing?

20:44.284 --> 20:46.995
Is now and ever shall be,
world without end.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.121
Amen.

20:49.414 --> 20:50.958
Crazy fools,
the Irish.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.125
You should know.

20:53.877 --> 20:55.712
(shouting in German)

20:58.090 --> 21:00.676
Smokey, the window,
let's go!

21:21.238 --> 21:23.907
(distant gunfire)

21:21.238 --> 21:23.907
(horse neighs)

21:25.826 --> 21:27.327
Ho.
Morning, sir.

21:27.411 --> 21:28.620
What's your name,
trooper?

21:28.704 --> 21:31.248
Sergeant Farmsworth
from Able Company 501st.

21:31.331 --> 21:32.791
I'm here and I'm supposed
to tell you

21:32.874 --> 21:34.876
that we got it clear from
here all the way to the north

21:34.960 --> 21:35.961
of them Krauts, sir.

21:36.044 --> 21:38.171
Well, tell your CO
506 arrived in force

21:38.255 --> 21:39.923
and secured all positions
south of you.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.342
Yes, sir, I'll tell him.
Come on, bad boy, let's go!

21:43.385 --> 21:44.511
Lieutenant Winters.

21:44.594 --> 21:45.679
Yes, sir?

21:45.762 --> 21:47.431
Is it safe
to cross now?

21:48.473 --> 21:49.433
What's that, sir?

21:49.516 --> 21:51.143
Is it safe
to cross?

21:51.226 --> 21:52.561
We wanna move
the wounded.

21:52.644 --> 21:53.603
Ah, yes, sir.

21:53.687 --> 21:54.563
Okay.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.732
(gunfire continues)

21:58.817 --> 22:00.444
Come on, let's get 'em
out of here.

22:06.700 --> 22:07.743
(bullet ricochets)

22:07.826 --> 22:08.952
(grunts)

22:18.628 --> 22:19.755
Roe:
There she is.

22:19.838 --> 22:21.089
(Winters groans)

22:19.838 --> 22:21.089
Man:
Plasma drip.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.718
You're lucky
it was a ricochet.

22:26.219 --> 22:27.846
You just caught
a piece of it.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.556
(mutters) Stupid.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.556
What?

22:29.639 --> 22:32.976
Nothing.

22:29.639 --> 22:32.976
Man: Walking wounded
to the rear.

22:33.060 --> 22:35.103
Now, you gonna be
able to stay off it?

22:35.187 --> 22:36.730
Doesn't look
that way.

22:36.813 --> 22:38.440
Well, you gotta try, huh?

22:39.649 --> 22:40.859
What have
we got planned, chief?

22:41.818 --> 22:43.403
Well, we expect
a counterattack.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.907
Carentan's as important
to them as it is to us.

22:46.990 --> 22:48.200
Any idea when?

22:49.159 --> 22:50.410
We're not waiting
around to find out.

22:50.494 --> 22:53.205
Battalion wants us to
head east toward high ground,

22:53.288 --> 22:54.456
set up
a defensive position.

22:56.291 --> 22:57.375
With all
the flooded fields,

22:57.459 --> 22:59.419
it's the only direction
they could approach from.

22:59.503 --> 23:00.504
Yeah.

23:00.587 --> 23:02.631
You gonna
be all right?

23:02.714 --> 23:04.758
Yup. Yeah.

23:07.511 --> 23:08.553
Good.

23:14.434 --> 23:15.894
What's wrong
with Blithe?

23:18.438 --> 23:21.441
Well, nothing...
except he can't see.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.401
He can't see?

23:23.485 --> 23:24.694
So he says.

23:42.838 --> 23:43.880
Blithe?

23:46.174 --> 23:47.342
It's Lieutenant Winters.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.512
What happened?

23:52.764 --> 23:53.849
I don't know, sir.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.518
Things--

23:56.601 --> 23:59.062
they just kinda
went black on me.

24:01.481 --> 24:02.732
You can't see?

24:02.816 --> 24:04.276
Not a thing, sir.

24:04.359 --> 24:06.486
I can't see
a thing.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.950
Well, you just
take it easy, Blithe.

24:13.451 --> 24:14.703
We're gonna get you
out of here.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.663
Get you back
to England.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.292
It's gonna
be okay.

24:23.587 --> 24:24.629
Sir.

24:27.883 --> 24:30.594
I didn't wanna
let anyone down.

24:34.222 --> 24:35.432
Just take it easy.

24:39.144 --> 24:40.478
It's okay, son.

24:52.574 --> 24:53.742
Sir.

24:57.037 --> 24:58.079
Yeah, what is it?

24:58.163 --> 24:59.414
Thank you, sir.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.502
I'm okay.

25:07.547 --> 25:09.049
Yeah, I'm okay.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.677
I'm okay.
I think I'm okay.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.180
You can see?

25:16.765 --> 25:18.767
God, I don't know
what happened.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.646
I think--
I think I'm okay.

25:25.732 --> 25:26.942
All right.

25:28.193 --> 25:29.736
Well, stay here
a little while longer...

25:30.737 --> 25:32.322
and make sure.

25:32.405 --> 25:34.950
And, then you can
report back to your platoon.

25:38.828 --> 25:39.871
Yes, sir.

25:51.466 --> 25:53.260
Now, can we get
that bandage on?

25:55.470 --> 25:56.513
Yeah.

25:57.555 --> 25:58.807
More:
Berlin by Christmas.

25:58.890 --> 25:59.933
That's how I see it.

26:00.016 --> 26:01.685
Yeah, you're
full of it.

26:01.768 --> 26:03.228
Oh, god.

26:03.311 --> 26:06.731
This Kraut cheese
tastes like...

26:06.815 --> 26:08.775
It stinks.

26:08.858 --> 26:11.611
Bread's stale, too.

26:08.858 --> 26:11.611
Give me that.

26:11.695 --> 26:14.281
More:
Yes, sir, the way we came
in town today and took over,

26:14.364 --> 26:15.573
you know, it don't
seem like Jerry's

26:15.657 --> 26:16.616
got too much fight
left in him.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.285
Hey, More, don't get
hit in the face

26:18.368 --> 26:19.953
when Jerry throws in
the sponge, all right?

26:20.036 --> 26:22.497
You mark my words, Mal,
Berlin by Christmas.

26:23.456 --> 26:25.083
Enjoy it while it lasts.

26:25.166 --> 26:26.710
We'll be moving out, soon.

26:27.585 --> 26:30.255
Out of town,
Lieutenant? Already?

26:30.338 --> 26:31.381
That's right.

26:38.513 --> 26:40.807
Don't they know we're just
getting settled here?

26:46.855 --> 26:48.356
Nice, Groucho.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.692
What?

26:48.440 --> 26:50.692
Real smart.

26:50.775 --> 26:53.111
You know, you're taking
your life in your own hands.

26:53.194 --> 26:54.654
Ain't that right?

26:54.738 --> 26:56.906
I told you, I didn't
actually see it.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.575
What, Speirs shooting
the prisoners

26:58.658 --> 27:00.118
or the sergeant
in his own platoon?

27:00.201 --> 27:01.745
Sergeant?

27:00.201 --> 27:01.745
What? I didn't
hear that one.

27:01.828 --> 27:03.038
Wait. He shot
one of his own guys?

27:03.121 --> 27:05.498
Well, supposedly
the guy was drunk

27:05.582 --> 27:07.334
and refused
to go on a patrol.

27:07.417 --> 27:08.877
Who knows
if it's true?

27:10.503 --> 27:13.715
Well, I know a guy
who said an eyewitness

27:13.798 --> 27:16.885
told him that Speirs
posed those prisoners.

27:16.968 --> 27:19.220
Why? What for?

27:20.305 --> 27:21.389
On D-Day...

27:22.557 --> 27:25.018
Speirs comes across
this group of Kraut prisoners

27:25.101 --> 27:26.895
digging a hole
or some such

27:26.978 --> 27:28.897
<i>under guard</i>
<i>and all.</i>

27:28.980 --> 27:31.316
<i>He breaks out</i>
<i>a pack of smokes,</i>

27:31.399 --> 27:32.776
<i>passes them out.</i>

27:32.859 --> 27:34.694
<i>He even gives</i>
<i>'em a light.</i>

27:37.906 --> 27:39.616
<i>Then, all of a sudden,</i>

27:39.699 --> 27:41.326
<i>he swings up</i>
<i>his Thompson...</i>

27:41.409 --> 27:44.329
and... (mimics machine-gun)
he hoses 'em.

27:48.792 --> 27:52.712
I mean, goddamn,
gives 'em smokes first?

27:52.796 --> 27:56.091
Mmm, you see,
that's why I don't
believe he really did it.

27:56.174 --> 27:57.133
Oh, you don't
believe it?

27:57.217 --> 27:58.385
Whoa, whoa.

27:57.217 --> 27:58.385
I heard he didn't do it.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.895
More:
Oh, no, no,
it was him all right.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.064
But it was more
than eight guys.

28:11.147 --> 28:12.816
It was more
like 20.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.114
Hell of a shot.

28:20.448 --> 28:22.158
All except one guy...

28:22.242 --> 28:23.576
<i>who he left alone.</i>

28:25.412 --> 28:27.080
Well, all I know,
from what I heard,

28:27.163 --> 28:30.041
he took that last 105 on D-Day
practically by himself.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.001
Running through
MG fire like a maniac.

28:32.085 --> 28:33.253
Yeah, that
I did see.

28:33.336 --> 28:34.462
On his own?

28:33.336 --> 28:34.462
Yeah.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.381
I don't care if any
of the other stuff's true.

28:36.464 --> 28:37.757
Hey, Albert.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.427
Hmm?

28:38.883 --> 28:40.427
What do you think?

28:42.011 --> 28:43.138
I don't know.

28:43.221 --> 28:45.765
I'm gonna have to take
everybody's word for it.

28:45.849 --> 28:47.100
I didn't see
any of it.

28:47.183 --> 28:49.894
Let's go, 1st Platoon,
weapons on me.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.271
We're moving out.

28:51.354 --> 28:52.439
Hey, take all
your smokes.

28:52.522 --> 28:53.857
Man:
On your feet,
tactical column.

28:53.940 --> 28:55.525
Flankers up.

28:53.940 --> 28:55.525
Muck: You want
to call for it?

28:55.608 --> 28:56.693
Flankers up!

28:55.608 --> 28:56.693
Penkala: Nope.

28:57.735 --> 28:59.320
That means you,
Private Blithe.

28:59.404 --> 29:01.114
Come on, Blithe,
get up.

29:01.197 --> 29:03.116
(chattering)

29:03.199 --> 29:04.534
You want the bread, Mickey?

29:04.617 --> 29:06.953
♪ ♪

29:07.036 --> 29:08.788
(shouting)

29:10.248 --> 29:12.834
(thunder rumbling)

29:24.929 --> 29:26.222
Hey, Luz?

29:24.929 --> 29:26.222
What?

29:26.306 --> 29:27.265
How far we going?

29:27.348 --> 29:30.643
Oh, Jesus Christ,
Frank, I don't know.

29:30.727 --> 29:32.854
Until they
tell us to stop.

29:32.937 --> 29:34.230
High ground.

29:34.314 --> 29:36.649
There's high
ground up ahead.

29:36.733 --> 29:39.486
Okay, genius,
answer me this then:

29:39.569 --> 29:42.906
Why is Easy Company
the only company who's either

29:42.989 --> 29:46.159
at the front of an advance
or, like now,

29:46.242 --> 29:48.161
exposed at the far
edge of the line?

29:48.244 --> 29:49.829
To keep you
on your toes.

29:49.913 --> 29:51.164
Perconte:
No, that's not
what I'm saying.

29:51.247 --> 29:53.791
I'm saying that we're
never in the middle.

29:53.875 --> 29:57.295
And we're the fifth of nine
companies of this regiment.

29:57.378 --> 29:59.547
"Able" through "Item."
Think of it.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.633
See there,
you see that?

29:59.631 --> 30:01.633
(gunfire)

30:03.134 --> 30:04.385
Incoming!

30:05.762 --> 30:07.055
Contact right!

30:07.138 --> 30:08.890
Get in
the hedgerow!

30:13.978 --> 30:15.104
See what I mean?

30:17.482 --> 30:19.526
Left, bring it
around!

30:25.406 --> 30:26.282
Stay low!

30:26.366 --> 30:29.285
Luz, get down here
with the radio now!

30:29.369 --> 30:31.871
(men shouting)

30:34.707 --> 30:37.335
(hyperventilating)

30:50.431 --> 30:53.268
(singing in German)

30:53.351 --> 30:55.937
(thundering)

31:09.909 --> 31:11.077
Ah!

31:15.665 --> 31:17.834
What have they got
to sing about?

31:20.920 --> 31:22.171
Flash!

31:23.548 --> 31:24.591
Thunder.

31:25.883 --> 31:27.927
Catchy tune...
ain't it?

31:28.011 --> 31:31.222
Hey, Lieutenant,
what's the news?

31:31.306 --> 31:33.349
Oh, same as it was
this afternoon.

31:33.433 --> 31:35.977
They're in their hedgerow,
we're in ours.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.521
Spell me
a minute, sir?

31:38.605 --> 31:40.607
Are you gonna let Blithe
get some sack time?

31:40.690 --> 31:41.941
My back teeth
are floating.

31:42.025 --> 31:44.444
Get back here
ASAP, Martin.

31:44.527 --> 31:46.321
You can count on me, sir.

31:54.495 --> 31:55.622
Oh.

31:57.498 --> 31:58.875
How you doing,
Blithe?

32:00.251 --> 32:01.628
I'm okay, sir.

32:02.712 --> 32:04.672
What happened
at the aid station today?

32:07.425 --> 32:08.843
Doc Roe, he...

32:08.926 --> 32:11.346
called it
hysterical blindness.

32:14.932 --> 32:16.267
No, thank you, sir.

32:17.143 --> 32:19.103
You know what
they said in basic:

32:19.187 --> 32:21.981
Dehydration's
a soldier's worst enemy.

32:25.985 --> 32:27.028
Yeah.

32:29.447 --> 32:31.074
It's a game,
Blithe.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.451
That's all.

32:35.370 --> 32:37.080
Hell, we're just
moving the ball forward

32:37.163 --> 32:38.498
one yard at a time.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.084
Nothing but a game.

32:44.837 --> 32:46.089
What is, sir?

32:47.340 --> 32:48.549
This.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.009
The whole thing.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.262
No.

32:53.346 --> 32:54.514
Thank you, sir.

32:55.640 --> 32:56.891
Just a game.

32:58.267 --> 32:59.352
Winters: Harry?

33:11.698 --> 33:15.201
S2 said the Germans only left
a company to defend Carentan.

33:15.284 --> 33:16.119
Oh.

33:16.202 --> 33:18.371
The rest pulled out
sometime last night.

33:18.454 --> 33:20.289
I knew that town
was too easy.

33:20.373 --> 33:21.499
Yeah.

33:24.001 --> 33:26.379
They regrouped
south of town.

33:26.462 --> 33:28.589
May have been on their way
to a counterattack

33:28.673 --> 33:30.883
when we ran
into 'em here.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.844
Strength unknown.

33:32.927 --> 33:34.679
(gunshots)

33:36.681 --> 33:38.307
They want
the town back.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.310
And we're
in their way.

33:41.394 --> 33:42.770
If they don't
come before then,

33:42.854 --> 33:45.189
we're attacking
at first light, 0530.

33:46.733 --> 33:48.651
I'll tell the men
to fix bayonets.

33:50.945 --> 33:52.321
Not much of a limp.

33:54.323 --> 33:55.533
I'll survive.

33:55.616 --> 33:56.617
How is it?

33:57.618 --> 33:58.786
Hurts.

34:00.288 --> 34:01.497
War is hell.

34:06.544 --> 34:08.254
(snoring)

34:19.599 --> 34:20.975
(whispering)
Smith, wake up.

34:22.727 --> 34:24.479
Come on, Smith.
Get up, it's your watch.

34:24.562 --> 34:26.606
Smith. It's your watch.

34:24.562 --> 34:26.606
(moans)

34:28.191 --> 34:29.734
Easy, Smith,
it's me, Talbert.

34:31.611 --> 34:33.571
Smith, what the hell
are you doing?

34:33.654 --> 34:35.323
That's Talbert.

34:33.654 --> 34:35.323
I didn't--

34:35.406 --> 34:36.616
Goddamn.

34:38.284 --> 34:39.827
Oh, gosh.

34:38.284 --> 34:39.827
Medic!

34:39.911 --> 34:41.621
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to.

34:41.704 --> 34:43.122
He looked
like a Kraut.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.415
I didn't know
it was him.

34:44.499 --> 34:45.750
Can you breathe?

34:44.499 --> 34:45.750
Yeah, I can breathe.

34:45.833 --> 34:47.418
Look at me,
look at me.

34:47.502 --> 34:49.128
Can you breathe?

34:47.502 --> 34:49.128
Yeah, I can breathe!

34:49.212 --> 34:51.881
I'm just gonna put some
sulfur on the wound, Floyd.
You're gonna be fine.

35:02.391 --> 35:03.810
What the hell
is that?

35:06.562 --> 35:08.481
Sounds like it's coming
from 3rd Platoon.

35:11.317 --> 35:12.902
You wanna get
some sleep?

35:14.362 --> 35:17.365
I don't think--
I don't think I can.

35:19.450 --> 35:20.660
Then go take a look.

35:24.705 --> 35:25.748
Sarge.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.309
(groaning)

35:54.277 --> 35:55.528
(clicks)

35:58.322 --> 36:00.324
Flash.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.324
Thunder, thunder!

36:02.159 --> 36:03.661
Lieutenant Speirs, sir.

36:04.579 --> 36:05.788
Where are you going,
Private?

36:07.123 --> 36:09.625
Check out
the noise, sir.

36:09.709 --> 36:12.170
I just came from there.
Everything's under control.

36:14.755 --> 36:15.882
Yes, sir.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.888
Got some nervous privates
in your company.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.599
We do, sir.

36:24.682 --> 36:28.060
Yeah, we do,
I can vouch for that.

36:28.144 --> 36:30.229
They just don't see
how simple it is.

36:34.483 --> 36:36.235
How simple
what is, sir?

36:44.994 --> 36:46.829
Just do what
you have to do.

36:49.457 --> 36:50.917
Like you did
on D-Day, sir?

36:54.045 --> 36:55.296
Lieutenant.

36:57.715 --> 36:59.884
Sir, when I landed
on D-Day,

36:59.967 --> 37:03.095
I found myself in a ditch
all by myself.

37:06.349 --> 37:07.683
I fell asleep.

37:09.393 --> 37:12.521
I think it was those
air-sickness pills

37:12.605 --> 37:13.648
they gave us.

37:18.235 --> 37:22.615
When I woke up, I didn't
really try to find my unit...

37:24.867 --> 37:25.952
to fight.

37:27.370 --> 37:28.621
I just...

37:31.832 --> 37:33.751
I just kinda
stayed put.

37:37.254 --> 37:38.673
What's your name,
trooper?

37:40.841 --> 37:42.134
Blithe, sir.

37:42.218 --> 37:43.511
Albert Blithe.

37:46.597 --> 37:48.599
You know why you hid
in that ditch, Blithe?

37:50.226 --> 37:51.560
I was scared.

37:52.645 --> 37:54.188
We're all scared.

37:58.442 --> 38:01.654
You hid in that ditch because
you think there's still hope.

38:01.737 --> 38:05.533
But, Blithe, the only hope
you have is to accept the fact

38:05.616 --> 38:07.410
that you're
already dead.

38:07.493 --> 38:09.662
And the sooner
you accept that,

38:09.745 --> 38:11.330
the sooner you'll
be able to function

38:11.414 --> 38:14.125
as a soldier's
supposed to function.

38:14.208 --> 38:16.293
Without mercy,
without compassion,

38:16.377 --> 38:17.920
without remorse.

38:19.630 --> 38:21.298
All war depends
upon it.

38:36.313 --> 38:38.691
Man:
<i>Stow your canteens.</i>
<i>Check the corks.</i>

38:38.774 --> 38:40.151
Petty:
<i>Hey, guys,</i>
<i>you got any smokes?</i>

38:40.234 --> 38:42.695
You want some of
this candy shit? No?

38:40.234 --> 38:42.695
No, I'm all right.

38:42.778 --> 38:44.989
The outpost
got ammo.

38:42.778 --> 38:44.989
Hey, Boyle.

38:45.072 --> 38:46.198
Here you go, guys.

38:46.282 --> 38:47.867
No, we don't know
what they've got.

38:47.950 --> 38:50.327
We may be attacking
a weaker force,

38:50.411 --> 38:52.121
possibly more
paratroopers.

38:52.204 --> 38:54.040
And you know
how they can be.

38:52.204 --> 38:54.040
(chuckles)

38:54.123 --> 38:57.835
Fire and maneuver.
That's the name of the game,
fire and maneuver.

38:57.918 --> 39:00.921
Dog and Fox Companies
will be on our left flank,
moving with us.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.089
Any questions?

39:05.217 --> 39:06.761
Let's make
'em holler.

39:06.844 --> 39:09.263
It's 9:30 in
the evening back home.

39:09.346 --> 39:10.389
(mortar whooshes)

39:09.346 --> 39:10.389
Must be.

39:10.473 --> 39:12.558
Mortar!

39:10.473 --> 39:12.558
Incoming!

39:12.641 --> 39:13.976
Everybody get
in the hole!

39:17.438 --> 39:18.898
Down, down, down,
down, down!

39:18.981 --> 39:21.650
Get that OP in!

39:21.734 --> 39:23.736
Tell 'em to hold,
I'm checking the lines.

39:23.819 --> 39:25.696
All Easy stations,
Easy Six.

39:25.780 --> 39:26.947
Hold in position, over.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.824
Go, lock and load!

39:34.663 --> 39:36.582
Easy Six,
Easy Red Six.

39:36.665 --> 39:38.626
I've got mortars
all across my line.

39:38.709 --> 39:39.960
No sign
of infantry yet.

39:40.044 --> 39:41.796
I'm pulling
the OP in, over.

39:41.879 --> 39:45.966
Right stake plus 15,
charge three.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.760
Range, 600.

39:47.843 --> 39:50.221
Lock and load! Fire!

39:51.097 --> 39:54.225
Up! Echo! Fire!

39:51.097 --> 39:54.225
(gunfire)

39:58.729 --> 40:01.690
Come on, move it,
move it, hurry!

40:05.319 --> 40:07.863
Watch for silhouettes
on the horizon!

40:07.947 --> 40:11.408
Find your target!
Muzzle fire!

40:11.492 --> 40:12.660
Nail it!

40:12.743 --> 40:14.662
Mortar! Keep low!

40:16.247 --> 40:19.125
Keep low,
go, go, go!

40:21.418 --> 40:22.711
Perconte!

40:22.795 --> 40:24.630
Get your men
in order!

40:24.713 --> 40:25.714
Stay low!

40:25.798 --> 40:27.508
Pour it at 'em,
Perconte.

40:27.591 --> 40:28.676
To your left.

40:28.759 --> 40:30.386
Keep going,
keep going.

40:31.595 --> 40:33.097
Keep it up!

40:35.641 --> 40:37.184
I want fire
superiority!

40:37.268 --> 40:39.228
Guarnere, keep 'em
pinned down.

40:39.311 --> 40:40.396
Keep firing!

40:42.481 --> 40:45.151
Sergeants, reverse!
Cover the crest
of that hill!

40:56.203 --> 40:59.957
(screaming) No! No!

41:01.667 --> 41:03.085
No!

41:09.800 --> 41:11.886
(screams)

41:18.684 --> 41:20.728
(shouts in German)

41:20.811 --> 41:23.272
Where in the hell
did they come from?

41:34.533 --> 41:37.244
Holy shit, there goes
our left flank.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.330
Sir, Dog and Fox
are pulling back.

41:39.413 --> 41:40.498
What?

41:45.211 --> 41:47.171
Who gave that order,
goddamn it?

41:55.137 --> 41:57.223
Keep firing,
stay low!

41:57.306 --> 41:59.266
Stay low, keep firing,
Perconte.

42:02.061 --> 42:03.187
Winters:
Come on, Blithe!

42:03.270 --> 42:05.022
Stand up!

42:05.105 --> 42:06.982
Get up on your feet,
soldier.

42:08.025 --> 42:09.360
Get up, Blithe.

42:11.570 --> 42:13.030
That's right,
Blithe.

42:13.113 --> 42:14.365
You can do it!

42:17.660 --> 42:19.662
Fire your weapon,
Blithe.

42:19.745 --> 42:22.831
Hit those goddamn Germans,
Blithe!

42:22.915 --> 42:25.459
Rip it a new one, Blithe!

42:37.054 --> 42:39.682
Keep firing!
Let 'em have it.

42:40.599 --> 42:43.477
Keep firing!
Don't slack it off.

42:43.560 --> 42:45.980
Let 'em have it,
Blithe!

42:48.107 --> 42:49.942
Pour it on 'em,
Blithe!

42:55.823 --> 42:56.949
Fire!

42:57.032 --> 42:59.910
Clear away!

42:57.032 --> 42:59.910
Fire!

43:01.078 --> 43:02.621
Randleman:
Get some up there!

43:02.705 --> 43:04.623
(shouting)

43:04.707 --> 43:06.083
Move it!

43:15.718 --> 43:17.428
Let's go, McGrath,
on me.

43:17.511 --> 43:19.263
Shift your
fire right.

43:24.435 --> 43:25.602
Down, down!

43:33.527 --> 43:35.779
Get the gunner!

43:37.072 --> 43:38.240
Come on!

43:38.324 --> 43:40.534
You're gonna get
me killed, Lieutenant.

43:43.078 --> 43:44.705
I knew you'd
get me killed.

43:47.082 --> 43:49.043
Don't fire till
I tell you, McGrath.

43:49.126 --> 43:51.086
I knew you were
gonna get me killed.

43:51.170 --> 43:53.464
Hold your fire!

43:51.170 --> 43:53.464
No, that's too close!

43:53.547 --> 43:55.049
Bitch, son of a bitch!

43:55.132 --> 43:56.300
McGrath:
Too close.

44:09.897 --> 44:11.315
Medic!

44:12.274 --> 44:13.359
Don't move!

44:14.401 --> 44:16.904
Now, fire, McGrath! Fire!

44:17.863 --> 44:19.406
Oh, good, good!

44:25.412 --> 44:28.040
Covering fire!

44:28.123 --> 44:29.583
Keep firing south.

44:31.168 --> 44:32.836
You hit
a home run, huh?

44:36.215 --> 44:37.591
Smith,
I've been hit.

44:37.674 --> 44:40.177
Just get the ammo,
get me out of here!

44:37.674 --> 44:40.177
I got you. All right!

44:46.392 --> 44:47.851
Medic!
