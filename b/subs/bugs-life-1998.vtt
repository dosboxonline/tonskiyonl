02:07.544 --> 02:10.342
No, no, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no.

02:10.413 --> 02:12.381
I'm lost!
Where's the line?

02:12.449 --> 02:15.441
<i>It just went away.
What do I do?</i>

02:15.519 --> 02:17.544
- Help!
- We'll be stuck here forever!

02:17.621 --> 02:19.987
Do not panic.
Do not panic!

02:20.056 --> 02:23.583
We are trained professionals.
Now, stay calm.

02:23.660 --> 02:25.821
We are going around the leaf.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.729
A- Around the leaf?
I don't think we can do that.

02:28.799 --> 02:32.667
Oh, nonsense. This is nothing
compared to the twig of '93.

02:32.736 --> 02:36.570
That's it. That's it. Good!

02:36.640 --> 02:40.303
You're doing great!
There you go. There you go!

02:40.377 --> 02:42.572
Watch my eyes.
Don't look away.

02:42.646 --> 02:46.606
- And here's the line again.
- Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Soil.

02:46.684 --> 02:49.676
Good job, everybody!

02:49.754 --> 02:52.188
<i>Oh, my.
There's quite a gap, Mr. Soil.</i>

02:52.256 --> 02:55.623
- Shouldn't we tell the queen?
- I don't think we need
to involve the queen in this.

02:55.693 --> 02:59.390
She's got enough on her plate already,
training her daughter.

02:59.463 --> 03:03.365
Oh, yes.
Princess Atta, the poor dear.

03:03.434 --> 03:07.097
Oh, wind's died down.
They'll be here soon.

03:07.171 --> 03:11.073
- Just be confident, dear.
You'll be fine.
- There's a gap.

03:11.142 --> 03:14.077
<i>There's a gap in the line.
What are we gonna do?</i>

03:14.145 --> 03:17.672
It's okay, Your Highness. Gaps happen.
We just lost a few inches, that's all.

03:17.748 --> 03:19.682
Oh. Right.

03:21.018 --> 03:23.748
Your Highness, I can't count
when you hover like that.

03:23.821 --> 03:25.755
Oh, of course.
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

03:25.823 --> 03:28.417
- Guys, go shade
someone else for a while.

03:28.492 --> 03:30.653
Okay, Atta.
Now what do we do?

03:30.728 --> 03:34.994
Ahh... Oh! Don't tell me.
I know it. What is it?

03:35.066 --> 03:37.500
<i>- We relax.
- Right.</i>

03:37.568 --> 03:40.969
Oh, it'll be fine.
It's the same, year after year.

03:41.038 --> 03:44.269
They come, they eat, they leave.
That's our lot in life.

03:44.342 --> 03:46.776
It's not a lot, but it's our life.

03:48.346 --> 03:51.474
Isn't that right, Aphie?
Oh, you're such a cute little aphid.

03:53.484 --> 03:55.418
- Ditch Dot!
- Yeah, yeah!

03:55.486 --> 03:57.750
Hey, come back here!

03:59.724 --> 04:01.658
<i>- Dot!
- Yes, Mother.</i>

04:01.726 --> 04:04.252
What did I tell you
about trying to fly?

04:04.329 --> 04:06.627
Not until my wings grow in.

04:06.698 --> 04:08.632
<i>- Right.
- But Mom...</i>

04:08.700 --> 04:11.464
Dot, you're a young queen ant
and your wings are too little...

04:11.536 --> 04:15.097
I was talking to Mother.
You're not the queen yet, Atta.

04:15.173 --> 04:17.697
Now, Dot,
be nice to your sister.

04:17.776 --> 04:20.005
<i>It's not my fault
she's so stressed out.</i>

04:20.077 --> 04:22.205
I know, I know.

04:22.281 --> 04:25.614
<i>- I'm always acting
like the sky is falling.
- Look out!</i>

04:25.684 --> 04:28.346
- Atta!
- Princess Atta!

04:45.671 --> 04:47.696
- Oh!
- Hey!

04:47.773 --> 04:50.799
<i>- Stop that!
- What do you think you're doing?</i>

04:50.876 --> 04:53.640
- You could have killed
somebody over here.
- I'm sorry!

04:53.712 --> 04:56.613
- Oh, it's Flik.
- Oh...

04:56.682 --> 04:58.809
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

04:58.884 --> 05:01.114
Please forgive me. I'm sorry!

05:01.186 --> 05:04.121
- Princess Atta!
- Flik, what are you doing?

05:04.189 --> 05:07.317
Oh, this! This is my new idea
for harvesting grain.

05:07.392 --> 05:10.623
No more picking individual kernels.
You cut down the entire stalk!

05:10.696 --> 05:15.190
- We don't have time for this.
- Exactly! We never have time
to collect food for ourselves.

05:15.267 --> 05:17.360
We spend all summer
harvesting for the offering.

05:17.436 --> 05:21.806
<i>- But my invention will
speed up production.
- Oh, another invention?</i>

05:21.874 --> 05:23.808
Something for you too.

05:23.876 --> 05:25.969
Since you're gonna be queen, you could
use this to oversee production.

05:26.045 --> 05:29.503
<i>- Dr. Flora, if I may.
- This is all very nice, but...</i>

05:29.582 --> 05:32.949
- Just an ordinary blade of grass
and a bead of dew, right?
- Flik, please.

05:33.019 --> 05:37.547
Wrong! It is, in fact, a telescope.

05:37.623 --> 05:41.218
- It's very clever, Flik, but...
- Hello, Princess! Aren't you
looking lovely this morning!

05:41.294 --> 05:44.092
Not that you would need
a telescope to see that.

05:44.163 --> 05:48.031
Listen! The princess doesn't
have time for this!

05:48.101 --> 05:50.160
You wanna help fill this thing?
Get rid of that machine,

05:50.236 --> 05:53.603
get back in line and pick grain
like everybody else!

05:53.673 --> 05:56.767
- Like everybody else!
- Please, Flik. Just go.

05:56.843 --> 05:59.004
I'm sorry,
I was really just trying...

06:00.079 --> 06:02.013
trying to help.

06:05.184 --> 06:10.713
<i>Harvester. Why, we harvested
the same way ever since I was a pupa.</i>

06:10.790 --> 06:13.258
Where were we?

06:13.326 --> 06:15.453
<i>- The food pile, Your Highness.
- Oh, yes, yes.</i>

06:15.528 --> 06:18.224
Hey, Flik! Wait up!

06:18.297 --> 06:20.231
Oh. Hello, Princess.

06:20.299 --> 06:22.859
You can call me Dot.
Here, you forgot this.

06:22.935 --> 06:25.665
Thanks. You can keep it.
I can make another one.

06:25.738 --> 06:30.072
- I like your inventions.
- Really? Well, you're the first.

06:30.143 --> 06:33.874
- I'm beginning to think
nothing I do works.
- This works.

06:33.946 --> 06:36.074
Great. One success.

06:36.150 --> 06:38.983
- I'm never gonna make a difference.
- Me, neither.

06:39.053 --> 06:42.784
I'm a royal ant and I can't
even fly yet. I'm too little.

06:42.856 --> 06:45.791
- Being little's not such a bad thing.
- Yes, it is.

06:45.859 --> 06:47.383
- No, it's not.
- Is too!

06:47.461 --> 06:50.328
- Is not. Is not! Is not!
- Is too. Is too! Is too!

06:50.397 --> 06:53.924
Oh! A seed.
I need a seed. Ahh...

06:58.705 --> 07:00.639
Ohh!

07:00.707 --> 07:02.641
Ah, here, here.

07:03.710 --> 07:05.735
Pretend... pretend
that that's a seed.

07:05.813 --> 07:07.906
- It's a rock.
- I know it's a rock.

07:07.981 --> 07:11.747
<i>But let's just pretend for a minute it's
a seed. We'll just use our imaginations.</i>

07:11.819 --> 07:13.753
Now, do you see our tree?

07:13.821 --> 07:16.984
<i>Everything that made
that giant tree...</i>

07:17.057 --> 07:20.390
is already contained
inside this tiny little seed.

07:20.461 --> 07:23.521
All it needs is some time, a little bit
of sunshine and rain, and...

07:23.597 --> 07:25.588
voila!

07:26.867 --> 07:29.097
This rock will be a tree?

07:29.169 --> 07:31.660
Seed to tree. You've gotta
work with me, all right?

07:31.738 --> 07:33.899
You might not feel
like you can do much now,

07:33.974 --> 07:36.568
but that's just because,
well, you're not a tree yet.

07:36.643 --> 07:39.669
You just have to give yourself
some time. You're still a seed.

07:39.746 --> 07:42.044
But it's a rock.

07:42.116 --> 07:44.050
<i>I know it's a rock!</i>

07:44.118 --> 07:48.054
Don't ya think I know a rock
when I see a rock? I've spent
a lot of time around rocks!

07:48.122 --> 07:50.387
You're weird, but I like you.

07:52.293 --> 07:54.124
They're here.

08:09.777 --> 08:12.837
- They're coming!
- Run!

08:12.914 --> 08:16.680
- Dot! Dot!
- Mom!

08:16.751 --> 08:18.912
- Mom!
- Thank heavens!

08:18.987 --> 08:23.617
- Food to the offering stone.
- Everyone, single file.

08:23.691 --> 08:27.218
Food to the offering stone
and into the anthill. Now let's go!

08:27.295 --> 08:30.594
Go, go, go, go!

08:55.290 --> 08:58.691
Come on, keep movin', keep movin'!
Good.

08:58.760 --> 09:01.228
<i>Okay. That's everyone.</i>

09:02.597 --> 09:04.531
<i>Hey!</i>

09:04.599 --> 09:07.262
Hey, wait for me!

09:07.336 --> 09:10.464
Get the food to the offering stone,
then into the anthill.

09:44.907 --> 09:46.841
Princess Atta!
Princess Atta!

09:46.909 --> 09:48.843
Princess Atta!

09:58.053 --> 10:02.114
They come, they eat, they leave.
They come, they eat, they leave.

10:02.191 --> 10:04.659
Excuse me, pardon me.
Pardon me, excuse me. Coming through.

10:04.727 --> 10:07.287
Sorry. Coming through. Princess Atta,
there's something I need to tell you.

10:07.363 --> 10:11.390
- Not now, Flik. Shh!
- But Your Highness,
it's about the offering!

10:11.467 --> 10:14.959
<i>Hey, what's goin'on?</i>

10:15.037 --> 10:16.971
<i>Yeah, where's the food?</i>

10:19.208 --> 10:23.407
<i>- What did you do?
- It was an accident?</i>

10:38.762 --> 10:41.390
Boo!

10:42.632 --> 10:45.726
Where's the food?

10:56.846 --> 10:59.076
Hopper.

11:24.407 --> 11:27.137
So, where is it?

11:27.210 --> 11:29.610
<i>Where's my food?</i>

11:32.615 --> 11:35.448
- I-I-Isn't it up there?
- What?

11:35.518 --> 11:38.146
- The food was in a leaf
sitting on top...
- Excuse me.

11:38.221 --> 11:40.349
Are you sure
it's not up there?

11:40.424 --> 11:42.551
- Are you saying I'm stupid?
- No.

11:42.626 --> 11:45.618
Do I look stupid... to you?

11:45.696 --> 11:49.097
Let's just think about the logic,
shall we? Think about it for a second.

11:49.166 --> 11:52.294
If it was up there,
would I be coming down here,

11:52.370 --> 11:55.339
to your level,
looking for it?

11:55.406 --> 11:57.840
- Uh, I...
- Why am I even talking to you?

11:57.908 --> 12:00.604
You're not the queen.
You don't smell like the queen.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.613
<i>Sh-She's learning
to take over for me, Hopper.</i>

12:03.681 --> 12:08.846
Oh, I see. Under new management.
So it's your fault.

12:08.919 --> 12:11.945
No, it wasn't me, it was...

12:12.022 --> 12:16.686
<i>Uh-uh-uh. First rule of leadership:
Everything is your fault.</i>

12:16.761 --> 12:20.492
- But-But I...
- It's a bug-eat-bug world
out there, Princess,

12:20.564 --> 12:23.863
one of those circle-of-life
kind of things.

12:23.934 --> 12:27.301
<i>Now, let me tell you
how things are supposed to work.</i>

12:27.371 --> 12:31.432
The sun grows the food,
the ants pick the food,

12:31.509 --> 12:33.500
the grasshoppers eat the food...

12:33.577 --> 12:35.670
<i>And the birds eat the grasshoppers.</i>

12:35.746 --> 12:39.045
Hey, like the one that nearly ate you,
you 'member? Oh, you shoulda seen it.

12:39.116 --> 12:42.517
This blue jay has
him halfway down his throat,
and Hopper's kickin' and screamin'.

12:42.586 --> 12:44.520
<i>And I'm scared.
I'm not goin'anywhere near, okay?</i>

12:44.588 --> 12:49.355
Aw, come on.
It's a great story. Ow, ow, ow.

12:49.427 --> 12:53.295
I swear, if I hadn't promised
Mother on her deathbed...

12:53.364 --> 12:55.993
<i>that I wouldn't kill you,
I would kill you.</i>

12:56.067 --> 12:59.059
- And believe me, no one
appreciates that more than I do.
- Shut up!

12:59.137 --> 13:01.401
I don't want to hear another word
out of you while we're on this island.

13:01.473 --> 13:03.998
Do you understand me?

13:04.075 --> 13:08.011
- I said, do you understand me?
- How can I answer? You said
I couldn't say another word.

13:08.079 --> 13:10.639
Remember Ma!

13:15.153 --> 13:18.850
Hey, I'm a compassionate insect.

13:18.924 --> 13:21.586
There's still a few months
till the rains come,

13:21.660 --> 13:25.027
so you can all just try again.

13:25.096 --> 13:27.826
<i>But, Hopper, since it's
almost the rainy season,</i>

13:27.899 --> 13:30.163
we need this time
to gather food for ourselves.

13:30.235 --> 13:32.703
Listen, if you don't
keep your end of the bargain,

13:32.771 --> 13:35.001
then I can't guarantee your safety.

13:35.073 --> 13:38.907
And there are insects out there
that will take advantage of you.

13:38.977 --> 13:42.208
Someone could get hurt.

13:52.757 --> 13:55.351
What's the matter?
You scared of grasshoppers?

13:58.964 --> 14:01.262
- Dot!
- You don't like Thumper?

14:02.434 --> 14:05.028
Leave her alone!

14:14.914 --> 14:18.782
You want her?
Go ahead... take her.

14:21.521 --> 14:25.048
No?
Then get back in line.

14:29.061 --> 14:34.465
It seems to me that you ants
are forgetting your place.

14:34.534 --> 14:38.664
So let's double
the order of food.

14:38.738 --> 14:40.672
No! But-But...

14:40.740 --> 14:44.141
We'll be back
at the end of the season,

14:44.210 --> 14:47.771
when the last leaf falls.

14:53.619 --> 14:57.111
You ants have a nice summer.
Let's ride!

14:57.189 --> 15:01.023
Yee-ha!

15:05.431 --> 15:07.661
Ooh!

15:19.879 --> 15:22.848
Flik, what do you have
to say for yourself?

15:22.915 --> 15:26.316
Sorry. I... I'm sorry
for the way I am.

15:26.385 --> 15:28.581
I didn't mean for things
to go so wrong.

15:28.655 --> 15:31.146
I especially didn't want
to make you look bad, Princess.

15:31.224 --> 15:34.489
- Well, Flik, ya did.
- I was just trying to help.

15:34.561 --> 15:38.827
<i>- Then help us... don't help us.
- Help, help. Help?</i>

15:38.899 --> 15:41.094
Flik, you are sentenced to
one month digging in the tunnels.

15:41.168 --> 15:44.968
Excuse me, Your Highness.
Need I remind you of Flik's
tunnel-within-a-tunnel project?

15:45.038 --> 15:47.506
Helpers to help us.
That's it! We could...

15:47.574 --> 15:49.838
It took two days to dig him out.
Send him to Health and Ant Services.

15:49.910 --> 15:51.844
Heavens, no!

15:51.912 --> 15:56.144
We could leave the island,
the river bed's dry.
We could walk across and get helpers.

15:56.216 --> 15:59.014
We could! We could go
find helpers to help us.

15:59.086 --> 16:03.022
- It's perfect!
- Perfect? What's so perfect?

16:03.090 --> 16:06.491
Your Highness, don't you see?
We could send someone to get help!

16:06.560 --> 16:08.551
Leave the island?

16:08.629 --> 16:12.429
Why didn't I think of that?
Oh! Because it's suicide!

16:12.499 --> 16:14.933
<i>- She's right! We never leave the island.
- Never leave!</i>

16:15.002 --> 16:17.368
There's snakes and birds
and bigger bugs out there!

16:17.437 --> 16:19.667
Exactly! Bigger bugs!

16:19.740 --> 16:22.265
We could find bigger bugs
to come here and fight...

16:22.342 --> 16:24.936
and forever rid us
of Hopper and his gang!

16:25.012 --> 16:28.106
- Ludicrous!
- Who would do a crazy thing like that?

16:28.181 --> 16:30.945
- I'll volunteer.
I'd be happy to volunteer.

16:31.018 --> 16:34.681
You got a lot of spunk, kid,
but no one's gonna help a bunch of ants.

16:34.755 --> 16:39.055
At least we could try. I could travel
to the city! I could search there!

16:39.126 --> 16:41.560
<i>If you went, you'd be
on that silly search for weeks.</i>

16:41.628 --> 16:43.426
Royal huddle.

16:43.498 --> 16:46.626
- Great idea, Princess. It's perfect!
- Exactly.

16:46.701 --> 16:49.670
- Wait a minute.
What did we just decide here?
- To let Flik leave.

16:49.737 --> 16:52.570
While we keep harvesting
to meet Hopper's demands.

16:52.640 --> 16:57.043
- You see, with Flik gone, he can't...
- He can't mess anything up!

16:57.111 --> 17:03.016
Flik, after much deliberation, we have
decided to grant you your request.

17:03.084 --> 17:05.814
- Really?
- Really?
- Uh, really.

17:05.887 --> 17:08.320
Oh, thank you, Princess.
Thank you so much for this chance.

17:08.388 --> 17:11.415
- I won't let you down,
I promise, I promise, I promise.
- That's fine. No, forget it.

17:11.492 --> 17:15.588
- I should help repair
the damage before I go.
- No! No, no!

17:15.663 --> 17:17.790
<i>Just leave!</i>

17:45.960 --> 17:47.928
Hey.

17:58.439 --> 18:02.934
Don't worry!
The colony is in good hands!

18:03.011 --> 18:05.275
Bye, now.

18:12.721 --> 18:14.882
All right.

18:16.925 --> 18:19.723
Hey, fellas.
Beautiful mornin', huh?

18:22.698 --> 18:25.997
My dad gives you one hour
before you come back crying.

18:26.068 --> 18:28.002
Does he, now?

18:28.070 --> 18:30.038
- My dad doesn't think that.
- He doesn't, huh?

18:30.105 --> 18:33.165
- Naw, he's bettin' you're gonna die.
- Oh.

18:33.242 --> 18:35.972
He says if the heat doesn't get ya,
the birds will.

18:36.044 --> 18:37.978
I think he's gonna make it.

18:38.046 --> 18:41.675
- Nobody asked you, Your Royal Shortness.
- Yeah, Dot. What do you know?

18:41.750 --> 18:43.980
Hey, hey, hey.
Ease up. Come on.

18:44.052 --> 18:46.418
She's entitled
to her opinion too.

18:56.732 --> 18:58.757
<i>Ohh.</i>

18:58.834 --> 19:00.995
So go, already.

19:01.069 --> 19:03.367
- Hey!
- The city's that way.

19:03.438 --> 19:07.966
- I know.
- You're supposed to look for bugs,
not dandelions.

19:08.043 --> 19:10.511
You leave him alone.
He knows what he's doing.

19:10.579 --> 19:12.638
<i>That's right.</i>

19:12.714 --> 19:17.880
Here I go. For the colony,
and for oppressed ants everywhere!

19:20.023 --> 19:21.957
Whoa-oh.

19:23.259 --> 19:25.784
<i>- Wow!
- Hey!</i>

19:25.862 --> 19:29.059
- Hey-hey!
- Bye, Flik!

19:35.405 --> 19:37.373
Wow!

19:37.440 --> 19:41.206
Wow. Ohh!

19:43.179 --> 19:45.147
Whoa!

19:45.215 --> 19:47.706
Good luck, Flik!

19:47.784 --> 19:50.810
Bye! Whoa-oh!

19:50.887 --> 19:53.048
Flik!

19:53.122 --> 19:56.319
I'm... okay!

19:56.392 --> 20:00.419
- Your dad's right. He's gonna die.
- You just watch.

20:00.496 --> 20:04.398
He's gonna get the bestest,
roughest bugs you've ever seen!

20:06.669 --> 20:10.901
Get back! Get back!
Get back, you horrible beast!

20:10.974 --> 20:13.465
I have no fear! Aye-eee!

20:13.543 --> 20:16.137
- Ooh!
- Oh, my goodness.

20:16.212 --> 20:19.340
Oh, no!

20:21.551 --> 20:24.145
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Dim. An owie?
- Owie! Owie, owie.

20:24.220 --> 20:26.814
Please show Rosie the owie.
All right, Dim. It's okay.

20:30.226 --> 20:33.526
I have been in outhouses
that didn't stink that bad.

20:33.597 --> 20:36.293
This is ridiculous.
What a disappointment!

20:36.367 --> 20:39.803
- Oh, no!
- You! Come here! I want my money back!

20:39.870 --> 20:42.703
Uh, no refunds
after the first two minutes.

20:42.773 --> 20:44.468
Popcorn! Stale popcorn!

20:44.541 --> 20:47.533
We're losin' the audience!
You clowns get out there now!

20:47.611 --> 20:51.138
- I hate performing on an empty stomach!
- Do your act, Heimlich.

20:51.215 --> 20:54.548
- Then you can eat. Not now, Slim.
- P.T., what's the point?

20:54.618 --> 20:57.883
What's the point of going out there?
They'll only laugh at me.

20:57.955 --> 21:02.051
- That's because you're a clown!
- No, it's because I'm a prop!

21:02.126 --> 21:06.825
You always cast me as the broom,
the pole, the stick, a splinter.

21:06.897 --> 21:09.195
You're a walkingstick.
It's funny!

21:09.266 --> 21:11.564
- Now go!
- You parasite.

21:21.312 --> 21:24.406
Tra-la-la-la-la.
Spring's in the air.

21:24.481 --> 21:28.042
And I'm a flower with
nothing interesting to say.

21:28.118 --> 21:30.052
A bee!

21:30.120 --> 21:33.521
I am a cute little bumblebee!
Here I come!

21:35.092 --> 21:37.822
Slow down, you flowers!

21:37.895 --> 21:42.525
Candy corn! Here,
let me help you to finish it.

21:42.599 --> 21:46.763
Hey, cutie! Wanna pollinate
with a real bug?

21:49.574 --> 21:52.509
<i>Ooh, come to papa!</i>

21:52.577 --> 21:57.276
So, bein' a ladybug automatically makes
me a girl, is that it, flyboy? Huh?

21:57.349 --> 21:59.909
- She's a guy!
- Francis, leave them alone.

21:59.985 --> 22:03.182
- They are poo-poo heads!
- Not again.

22:03.254 --> 22:06.018
Judging by your breath, you must have
been buzzin' around a dung heap all day.

22:06.091 --> 22:09.458
- Come on, Francis.
You're making the maggots cry.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.501
All right, we're dyin' out there.
Gypsy, quick! You and Manny...

22:18.570 --> 22:20.697
Shh! He's in a trance.

22:20.772 --> 22:23.332
Well, get him out of it!
You and your husband are up now.

22:23.408 --> 22:25.342
Manny, we're on.

22:25.410 --> 22:30.313
Oh? Yet again it is up to me
to rescue the performance.

22:30.382 --> 22:32.316
Gypsy, come.

22:34.386 --> 22:37.253
- The stage is the other way, dear.
- Yes, of course.

22:37.322 --> 22:39.256
Anytime, pal!

22:39.324 --> 22:41.622
- I'm gonna pick the hairs
out of your head one by one!
- Take your best shot!

22:41.693 --> 22:43.627
- You name the place!
- Oh, yeah?

22:43.695 --> 22:46.858
- Yeah, 'cause when you
get there, you are dead!
- Francis, let me handle this.

22:46.931 --> 22:49.456
- That's no way to speak to a lady.
- I heard that, you twig.

22:49.534 --> 22:53.231
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me
to present Manto the Magnificent...

22:53.304 --> 22:56.796
and his lovely assistant, Gypsy!

22:58.410 --> 23:04.077
From the most mysterious
regions of uncharted Asia,

23:04.150 --> 23:07.642
I give you the Chinese Cabinet...

23:07.720 --> 23:10.450
of Metamorphosis!

23:11.757 --> 23:14.123
Rosie, whole troupe.
Onstage! Finale! Now!

23:14.193 --> 23:16.855
<i>- Okay, I just need time to...
Coming, coming.
- Now!</i>

23:16.929 --> 23:19.159
Tuck, Roll, let's get moving, guys.
We're up next.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.999
Don't you understand?
We are up!

23:24.070 --> 23:26.595
"Up-a."

23:26.672 --> 23:28.833
- Hey!
- Hey! They don't understand me.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.103
I summon the voice
of Confucius...

23:31.177 --> 23:33.737
<i>Get off the stage,
you old hack!</i>

23:33.813 --> 23:36.941
I demand to know who said that!

23:37.016 --> 23:40.383
How dare you!

23:42.621 --> 23:44.555
Ingrates!

23:45.624 --> 23:48.457
<i>Manny? Manny!</i>

23:48.527 --> 23:52.691
I only got 24 hours to live
and I ain't gonna waste it here.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.699
Come on.

23:56.602 --> 23:59.469
I've just about
had it with these losers!

23:59.538 --> 24:01.665
Flaming death!

24:03.442 --> 24:05.967
I hold in my hand the match...

24:06.045 --> 24:10.379
the match that decides whether two bugs
live or die this very evening.

24:10.449 --> 24:14.317
<i>In a moment, I will light
this trail of matches...</i>

24:14.386 --> 24:19.016
<i>leading to a sheet offlypaper
dowsed in lighter fluid!</i>

24:19.091 --> 24:23.688
Aimed directly at the flypaper
are Tuck and Roll,

24:23.763 --> 24:26.231
<i>the pill bug cannonballs!</i>

24:26.299 --> 24:28.358
<i>The cannon
will be triggered by Dim,</i>

24:28.435 --> 24:30.596
<i>trained tojump
at the sound of this bell...</i>

24:30.670 --> 24:33.867
<i>set to go off in 15 seconds.</i>

24:33.940 --> 24:37.671
<i>Our pill bugs'only hope
of survival is...</i>

24:37.744 --> 24:40.679
our mistress
of the high wire, Rosie!

24:40.747 --> 24:43.238
<i>Secured to a web line
of exact length,</i>

24:43.316 --> 24:46.410
<i>Rosie will plummet down
to these two posts,</i>

24:46.486 --> 24:50.013
spinning a web of safety
in less than 15 seconds!

24:51.791 --> 24:56.057
Not good enough, you say?
Well, what if they were all...

24:56.129 --> 24:58.063
blindfolded!

25:03.370 --> 25:06.203
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
may I suggest that those of you...</i>

25:06.273 --> 25:08.764
with weak constitutions
leave the arena,

25:08.842 --> 25:11.640
<i>- for this act is so dangerous...</i>

25:11.711 --> 25:14.111
That if the slightest thing
should go wrong...

25:14.181 --> 25:17.412
- No!
- Go? Okay, through the tunnel...

25:17.484 --> 25:19.645
Whoa!

25:19.719 --> 25:24.088
Whoa!

25:26.293 --> 25:28.784
- P.T!
- Oh, no!

25:28.862 --> 25:32.263
Oh!

25:34.834 --> 25:37.133
- Water! We need some water!
- Water, water, water!

25:41.375 --> 25:44.742
Get me outta here!

25:44.812 --> 25:46.803
Oof!

25:48.883 --> 25:51.579
Wow!

25:54.288 --> 25:58.122
- It's the web. I'm sorry.
- You're all fired.

25:58.192 --> 26:01.025
- We got the water!
- Here we come, P.T!

26:03.564 --> 26:07.796
Whoo! Whoa!
Burn 'im again!

26:26.287 --> 26:28.619
No, Harry, no!
Don't look at the light!

26:28.689 --> 26:31.487
I can't help it!
It's so beautiful!

26:37.265 --> 26:39.563
Try not to look
like a country bug.

26:39.634 --> 26:42.398
Blend... blend in.

26:43.471 --> 26:45.405
<i>Hey, buggy!</i>

26:45.473 --> 26:47.805
<i>What do you expect?
The guy's a tick.</i>

26:55.717 --> 26:59.016
<i>Wow! The city!</i>

27:14.303 --> 27:18.296
<i>Making all stops to the septic tank,
including standing water,</i>

27:18.373 --> 27:22.036
empty bean can and dead rat.

27:22.110 --> 27:24.442
<i>Watch your stingers. All aboard!</i>

27:24.513 --> 27:26.504
- Hey! Oh, sorry.
- Get out of the way!

27:26.581 --> 27:29.175
- Watch where you're goin'!
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

27:29.251 --> 27:31.845
Oh, sorry!

27:31.920 --> 27:34.548
<i>Oh. I'm really, really sorry.</i>

27:34.623 --> 27:37.114
That was
an-an-an ac-ac-accident.

27:40.128 --> 27:42.858
- Hey, let go of me!
- I'll show ya who's tough!

27:42.931 --> 27:47.061
- And stay out!
- Tough bugs!

27:48.937 --> 27:51.872
- I knew an old lady
who swallowed a fly...
- Wow!

27:51.940 --> 27:53.874
- Move it!
- Whoa!

27:53.942 --> 27:58.003
<i>Hey, waiter! I'm in my soup!</i>

27:58.080 --> 28:00.514
<i>I've been workin'out.
Feel my wing.</i>

28:00.582 --> 28:03.107
Yo!
Two Black Flags over here!

28:04.619 --> 28:08.111
- All right.
- Hair of the dog you bit.

28:08.191 --> 28:10.716
Hey, who ordered
the pu-pu platter?

28:11.794 --> 28:15.423
Here ya go, slick. Enjoy.

28:15.498 --> 28:18.558
Ow! Aah!
Hey, I said no salt!

28:19.836 --> 28:23.237
Pardon me, sir.
I represent a colony of ants,

28:23.306 --> 28:26.173
and I'm looking for tough bugs,
you know, mean bugs...

28:26.242 --> 28:29.234
Fired by a flea...
how humiliating!

28:29.312 --> 28:31.246
Let's face it: We stink.

28:31.314 --> 28:33.248
<i>- You fired!
- You fired!</i>

28:33.316 --> 28:36.945
- Oh, will you shut up?
- You fired!

28:37.019 --> 28:40.045
Someday I will be
a beautiful butterfly,

28:40.123 --> 28:42.455
and then everything
will be better.

28:42.525 --> 28:46.621
I can't believe the troupe is
breaking up. We've always been together.

28:46.696 --> 28:50.826
- Farewell, my friends.
- To the audience we'll never have.

28:54.737 --> 28:57.934
Francis! Your boyfriends
from the circus are here!

29:00.009 --> 29:02.034
There she is.

29:06.416 --> 29:09.852
- Hello there, girly bug.
- Shoo, fly. Don't bother me.

29:09.919 --> 29:13.013
Say, why don't you
tell our pal, Thud,

29:13.089 --> 29:15.387
- what you said to us at the circus.
- Yeah.

29:15.458 --> 29:19.053
- Somethin' about buzzin'
around a dung heap?

29:19.128 --> 29:22.188
Excuse me. Hi. I represent
an ant colony, and we're...

29:22.265 --> 29:25.827
Hey, bartender!
Bloody Mary, O-positive.

29:25.903 --> 29:27.837
Aha!

29:29.239 --> 29:31.173
Sir?

29:31.241 --> 29:35.302
# Ladybug, ladybug
fly away home #

29:35.379 --> 29:37.711
Not so tough now, are you?

29:37.781 --> 29:39.908
All right, clown.
Get up and fight like a girl.

29:39.983 --> 29:43.475
- Get ready to do the Robin Hood act.
- I want to be LittleJohn!

29:43.554 --> 29:47.251
- What part can I play?
- You see, I'm looking for
tough, warrior bugs.

29:47.324 --> 29:51.658
<i>Stand back, ye flies! We are
the greatest warriors in all bugdom!</i>

29:51.728 --> 29:54.595
- Warrior bugs!
- My sword!

29:54.665 --> 29:56.599
Swish, swish. Clang, clang.

29:56.667 --> 29:58.601
- LittleJohn?
- What ho, Robin?

29:58.669 --> 30:01.229
Justice is my sword
and truth shall be my quiver!

30:01.305 --> 30:04.502
Wait, wait! No, no!
I want to watch this!

30:04.575 --> 30:07.874
<i>- Jawohl!
- Thrust, parry, lunge!</i>

30:07.945 --> 30:10.243
Me thinketh it's not working!

30:10.314 --> 30:12.714
Back to Sherwood Forest!

30:12.783 --> 30:15.775
- Schnell! Schnell!
- What's going on in there?

30:27.798 --> 30:30.426
Help! Help! Get me out!

30:42.213 --> 30:45.649
<i>You're perfect!</i>

30:45.717 --> 30:50.984
Oh, great ones! I have been scouting
for bugs with your exact talents!

30:51.055 --> 30:53.956
<i>- A talent scout.
- My colony's in trouble.</i>

30:54.025 --> 30:57.927
Grasshoppers are coming! We've
been forced to prepare all this food.

30:57.996 --> 31:00.089
- Dinner theater!
- Food?

31:00.164 --> 31:03.258
Please!
Will you help us?

31:03.334 --> 31:06.735
Where are they?

31:06.804 --> 31:10.763
- We'll take the job!
- Really?
- Yes, yes, yes!

31:10.842 --> 31:13.276
You can explain
the details on the way.

31:13.344 --> 31:15.835
Hey!

31:15.914 --> 31:19.406
- Okay, come on, everyone. Break a leg!
- Whoa, you're vicious!

31:19.484 --> 31:21.418
Hold on, Mr. Ant.

31:21.553 --> 31:26.616
Amazing!
This is too good to be true!

31:42.340 --> 31:44.274
Ooh!

31:48.913 --> 31:51.939
So, you see, it was my fault
that Hopper's coming back.

31:52.016 --> 31:55.247
But then, Princess Atta...
boy, is she one in a million...

31:55.320 --> 31:57.255
she let me go out and find you.

31:57.323 --> 31:59.814
And after seeing you
fight off those flies...

31:59.892 --> 32:02.986
Boy, are those grasshoppers
in for a surprise!

32:26.552 --> 32:29.521
- Dr. Flora!
- Oh, dear. Not another one.

32:29.588 --> 32:31.556
- This is insane.
- Insane.

32:31.624 --> 32:34.024
There's just not enough
food left on the island!

32:34.093 --> 32:36.687
No way we can make double quota
before Hopper comes.

32:36.762 --> 32:40.789
Well, we have to try, Thorny.
We don't have any choice.

32:40.866 --> 32:42.891
Yeah, I know.

32:44.637 --> 32:48.505
<i>Hey, look who's playing
lookout again... little Speck!</i>

32:48.574 --> 32:52.943
<i>- The name is Dot.
- Well, Spot, still lookin' for Flik?</i>

32:53.012 --> 32:56.209
Forget it, Dot.
That loser's never coming back.

32:57.616 --> 32:59.675
<i>Flik!
He did it! He did it!</i>

32:59.752 --> 33:02.585
What? Quit shoving!

33:06.892 --> 33:10.589
This is it!
This is Ant Island!

33:10.663 --> 33:14.532
Flik! Over here!
Flik! Flik!

33:14.601 --> 33:17.934
- Hey!
- He did it! He did it! Yea!

33:18.004 --> 33:21.462
- He did it!
- Cool!

33:21.541 --> 33:24.999
At the rate these leaves are dropping,
we're gonna need a miracle.

33:25.078 --> 33:27.273
That's right!
We need a miracle!

33:29.683 --> 33:33.949
Run for your lives!

33:42.128 --> 33:44.426
Ta-da!

33:50.070 --> 33:54.336
Once again,
our reputation precedes us.

33:54.407 --> 33:56.898
Hey, everybody!
Hey! I'm back!

33:56.976 --> 34:02.573
<i>Hey, guys! Hey-ey!
Look-look-look who's here with me!</i>

34:02.649 --> 34:07.643
Flik! Flik! Flik! You're back!
I knew you could do it!

34:07.721 --> 34:10.417
- Flik?
- It's Flik!

34:17.630 --> 34:19.723
- Flik has returned!
- He's back?

34:19.799 --> 34:21.994
And he's accompanied
by savage insects!

34:22.068 --> 34:27.768
<i>What? How? He wasn't supposed
to actually find someone!</i>

34:27.841 --> 34:30.275
Oh, look at this.
This is great. Look.

34:30.344 --> 34:32.777
<i>- Oh, my ticker!
- So, what are you supposed to be?</i>

34:32.847 --> 34:35.371
He's a stick, stupid.
You hit bugs with him.

34:35.449 --> 34:38.315
- Well, that's an oversimplification.
- That's right, kids. Like this!

34:38.385 --> 34:40.319
- No! Put me down!
- Ow!

34:40.387 --> 34:44.652
- Hey!
- My, you just pop
right open there, dontcha?

34:44.725 --> 34:48.058
- Ooh! Wow!
- Uh-oh. Kids, He's kinda ticklish.

34:48.129 --> 34:50.723
Let's come on out. Careful.

34:53.234 --> 34:56.795
Well, my boy, you came through.

34:56.871 --> 34:59.897
Aphie and I are very impressed.

34:59.974 --> 35:05.640
Princess Atta! Hey, guys, Princess Atta!
She's the one that sent me to find you!

35:05.713 --> 35:09.274
- Did you see that
really big bug over there?
- He looks absolutely ferocious!

35:09.350 --> 35:13.013
- They're our ticket out of this mess!
- They came just in time!

35:13.087 --> 35:16.318
So, Princess Atta,
what do you think?

35:16.390 --> 35:19.359
No-no-no, wait!
This was not supposed to happen.

35:20.861 --> 35:22.886
Mayday, Mayday.
We're losin' the job.

35:22.963 --> 35:24.897
We don't fight grasshoppers.

35:24.965 --> 35:27.832
<i>- We don't, but they will.
- Bingo!</i>

35:27.902 --> 35:30.530
We gotta sweeten the deal.

35:31.806 --> 35:34.798
Your Majesty,
ladies and gentlemen,

35:34.875 --> 35:37.571
boys and girls of all ages,

35:37.645 --> 35:41.376
our troupe here guarantees
a performance like no other!

35:41.448 --> 35:44.417
Why, when your grasshopper friends
get here, we are gonna...

35:44.485 --> 35:47.319
knock them dead!

35:51.159 --> 35:53.889
Boy, these folks are sure
hard up for entertainment.

35:58.900 --> 36:00.834
<i>Come on, come on. Hurry!</i>

36:00.902 --> 36:03.700
Wow!

36:24.392 --> 36:26.860
Honey, relax.
You should be proud of yourself.

36:26.928 --> 36:30.796
- Your instincts on that boy
were right on the money.

36:38.540 --> 36:42.203
And to make our official
welcome complete... Mr. Soil?

36:42.277 --> 36:45.269
<i>- Yes, Your Highness?
- He's our resident thespian.</i>

36:45.347 --> 36:49.113
<i>Last year he played the lead
in Picnic.</i>

36:49.184 --> 36:53.211
The children... and myself...
have quickly put together...

36:53.288 --> 36:57.315
a little presentation
in honor of our guests.

36:57.392 --> 37:00.225
Dot, Reed, Daisy, Grub?

37:00.295 --> 37:02.560
Oh, aren't they adorable!
Ooh, they're cute!

37:04.967 --> 37:09.461
The South Tunnel Elementary School
second grade class...

37:09.538 --> 37:14.168
would like to present you with this,
a mural we have drawn...

37:14.243 --> 37:18.145
of you bugs helping us
fight the grasshoppers away.

37:18.214 --> 37:22.583
Oh, look at the beautiful colors
of the blood.

37:22.652 --> 37:26.179
We drew one of you dying because our
teacher said it would be more dramatic.

37:31.661 --> 37:35.222
I tell you a tale of heroes so bold,

37:35.298 --> 37:39.257
who vanquished our
grasshopper enemies of old.

37:41.203 --> 37:43.728
Look, the last leaf has fallen.

37:43.806 --> 37:47.037
We are the grasshoppers!
Where's our food?

37:47.109 --> 37:50.237
Who will come
to save us poor ants?

37:50.313 --> 37:53.407
We are the warriors,
here to defend you!

37:54.417 --> 37:59.411
<i>I die! Die! Die!</i>

38:02.191 --> 38:07.424
Thank you, thank you! Oh, thank you!

38:07.496 --> 38:10.260
- Hey, hey, hey!
- I say we go.

38:10.333 --> 38:13.131
- Okay, honey. You're up.
- Oh. Um...

38:13.202 --> 38:17.264
<i>- Oh, oh, I-I...
- We're all very grateful to have...</i>

38:17.341 --> 38:19.775
- Here, here.
- the warriors...

38:20.844 --> 38:22.778
Thanks.

38:22.846 --> 38:27.112
- I'd like to thank the warriors
for helping us in our fight...

38:27.184 --> 38:30.210
Against the grasshoppers.

38:30.287 --> 38:33.381
Secondly, I would like
to thank Flik...

38:33.457 --> 38:36.085
- for his forthright thinking...
- Thank you, Your Highness.

38:36.159 --> 38:40.391
Oh, sure, I'd like to take credit for
all of this, but that wouldn't be right.

38:40.464 --> 38:43.763
Because it was you, Princess Atta.
You believed in me...

38:43.834 --> 38:46.894
<i>- Tell that ant that we need
to talk to him right now.
- Okay, okay.</i>

38:46.970 --> 38:50.371
I know I've made mistakes in the past,
and I hope that this will make up...

38:50.440 --> 38:52.670
- Flik!
- Not right now, Rosie.
I'm making a speech.

38:54.244 --> 38:57.008
Now, I truly believe these bugs
are the answer to our...

38:57.080 --> 39:01.449
No, there's no circus around here.
So, I...

39:07.057 --> 39:10.686
Your Highness, the warriors
have called for a secret meeting
to plan for a circus...

39:10.761 --> 39:14.026
<i>circumventing the oncoming hordes so
they can trapeze... trap them with ease!</i>

39:14.097 --> 39:16.531
- Shouldn't I come too?
- No!

39:16.600 --> 39:22.129
No, classified in the D.M.Z.
Gotta go A.S.A.P. You know,
strictly B.Y.O.B. Bye!

39:22.205 --> 39:25.333
<i>Sorry. Sorry I have to take
the warriors away so early,</i>

39:25.409 --> 39:29.140
but you know they have a lot to get
done, with the battle looming and all.

39:29.212 --> 39:31.612
<i>So, uh, please,
everyone enjoy the party.</i>

39:31.681 --> 39:34.378
"B.Y.O.B."?

39:34.452 --> 39:36.920
Thanks again. Bye. Bye-bye.

39:36.988 --> 39:39.047
Okay, just...
just get in there. Go!

39:39.123 --> 39:41.057
Go! Go, go, go!

39:42.326 --> 39:46.262
Circus bugs?
How can you be circus bugs?

39:46.330 --> 39:48.264
- What?
- Hey, hey, hey.

39:48.332 --> 39:51.028
<i>- You said nothin' about killin'
grasshoppers. You lied to us!
- Ja!</i>

39:51.102 --> 39:53.229
Are you kidding?
Do you know what this is?

39:53.304 --> 39:55.738
This, my friends,
is false advertising.

39:55.807 --> 40:00.972
How dare you! You, sir,
are the charlatan in this scenario...

40:01.045 --> 40:03.309
touting your wares
as a talent scout,

40:03.381 --> 40:06.145
preying upon the hungry souls
of hapless artistes.

40:06.217 --> 40:08.151
Good day to you, sir.

40:12.957 --> 40:16.757
Wait! No, no!
Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't go.

40:16.828 --> 40:20.525
You have got to help me. Give me
some time, I'll come up with a plan.

40:20.598 --> 40:25.035
- Just go tell them the truth!
- They can't know the truth.
The truth, you see, is bad.

40:25.103 --> 40:29.096
I will be branded for life.
My children's children will
walk down the street,

40:29.173 --> 40:34.201
people will point and say, " Look! There
goes the spawn of Flik, the loser!"

40:34.278 --> 40:38.078
Oh... oh, you know, all right, fine.
Yeah, okay. Just go.

40:38.149 --> 40:40.743
But if you could just do me
a little favor before you leave.

40:40.818 --> 40:44.618
If you could squish me,
that would be great, because, uh,

40:44.689 --> 40:46.623
when they find out,
I'm as good as dead.

40:46.691 --> 40:49.627
<i>- Flik!</i>

40:49.695 --> 40:53.096
<i>I really do think I should be
part of this meeting. Flik!</i>

40:53.165 --> 40:56.066
Aah! Princess Atta!
What a nice... surprise.

40:56.135 --> 40:58.069
Just what exactly is going on?

40:58.137 --> 41:00.935
I would like to speak
with the so-called "warriors."

41:01.006 --> 41:03.065
You can't! They are in the middle
of a top secret meeting right now,

41:03.142 --> 41:05.110
and they really should not
be disturbed... now.

41:05.177 --> 41:07.270
Right, guys?

41:07.346 --> 41:11.646
Could you ex... pl...
Could you excuse me, please?

41:11.717 --> 41:15.118
<i>- Wait, wait, wait! Please, don't go!
- I'm not going anywhere.</i>

41:15.187 --> 41:18.247
What is going on? Flik?

41:18.323 --> 41:22.259
Flik!
Ooh, I knew it!

41:22.327 --> 41:26.491
<i> Wait! Wait,
wait, wait, wait! Please! Don't go!</i>

41:26.698 --> 41:30.725
- No!
- Quick, he's losin' it!

41:30.802 --> 41:34.568
- You can't go! I'm desperate!
- Really? I couldn't tell.

41:34.640 --> 41:37.905
Hmm. Come on, wings.

41:37.976 --> 41:40.410
Help!

41:40.479 --> 41:43.676
Mother,
Flik is up to something.

41:43.749 --> 41:46.411
Okay, Flik, time to put ya down.
Get him off me!

41:46.485 --> 41:48.646
He's cutting off the circulation.

41:48.720 --> 41:50.984
- No, no, no, no!
- Let go!

41:51.056 --> 41:55.618
<i>- Please, please, don't go!
- Put the stick down.
Flik, I mean it, now.</i>

41:55.761 --> 41:58.730
<i>- Drop the stick.
- Run!</i>

41:59.932 --> 42:03.368
Boy, he runs fast
for a little guy.

42:03.435 --> 42:07.031
Tweet-tweet! Tweet-tweet!

42:12.111 --> 42:14.636
This way.

42:15.715 --> 42:18.980
There they are.

42:19.052 --> 42:22.385
- A bird!
- Flik!

42:22.455 --> 42:24.980
- Look!
- Dot!

42:25.058 --> 42:26.992
Flik!

42:29.963 --> 42:32.659
- Dot!
- My baby!

42:33.900 --> 42:37.028
I gotcha! I gotcha!

42:37.103 --> 42:40.129
I gotcha, I gotcha!

42:40.206 --> 42:42.766
Oww!

42:42.842 --> 42:44.867
Oooh.

42:44.944 --> 42:46.741
- I can't see!
- Somebody do something!

42:46.813 --> 42:51.045
<i>- Are they all right?
- Did anyone see?
- What is happening?</i>

42:53.052 --> 42:55.885
- Dot?
- Good heavens, they're in trouble!

42:55.955 --> 42:59.220
- Francis, Francis, Francis,
Francis, Francis, Francis...
- Oh, you guys, I've got an idea!

42:59.292 --> 43:01.157
Here! I've got it!

43:04.097 --> 43:06.657
Please, ma'am, wake up!
Wake up!

43:11.070 --> 43:14.938
<i>- Help! Help!
- Yoo-hoo!</i>

43:15.008 --> 43:20.275
Mr. Early Bird! How about
a nice, tasty worm on a stick?

43:20.346 --> 43:23.043
I'm going to snap.
I'm going to snap.

43:23.117 --> 43:26.314
<i>Nice andjuicy, succulent...</i>

43:26.387 --> 43:28.617
Let's go!

43:31.692 --> 43:33.887
- There they are!
- Flik! Help!

43:35.095 --> 43:38.064
Okay.

43:38.132 --> 43:40.623
- Flik!
- It's going to be okay, Dot.

43:40.701 --> 43:45.604
Ooh-hoo-hoo!
Bye-bye, birdie!

43:45.673 --> 43:47.698
Help! I'm stuck!

43:47.775 --> 43:50.608
<i>Pull me down!
Schnell, schnell, schnell!</i>

43:50.678 --> 43:54.808
<i>- The caterpillar's using
himself as live bait!
- How brave!</i>

43:59.953 --> 44:03.116
Suck it in, man!

44:08.962 --> 44:10.827
Ow. My leg!

44:24.144 --> 44:27.580
The bird!
Look out for the bird!

44:29.750 --> 44:31.342
Flik!

44:32.586 --> 44:34.850
Up-a, up-a!

44:51.272 --> 44:54.833
What is that?

44:54.909 --> 45:00.176
That, my friends,
is the sound of applause!

45:13.461 --> 45:16.726
Applause... I'm in heaven!

45:18.633 --> 45:21.898
<i>Our Blueberry troop salutes you bugs
for rescuing our smallest member,</i>

45:21.970 --> 45:23.904
<i>Princess Dot.</i>

45:23.972 --> 45:27.567
And as a tribute to Miss Francis,
we've changed out bandannas!

45:27.642 --> 45:31.169
We voted you
our honorary den mother!

45:31.246 --> 45:35.649
What? Great.

45:35.717 --> 45:39.551
- All right, girls. Let's move
your keisters outta here now.

45:39.621 --> 45:42.283
The patient needs her rest,
you know. Come on.

45:42.357 --> 45:45.326
Excuse, me, Flik.
Can I talk to you for a second?

45:45.393 --> 45:47.224
- Huh? Oh, sure.
- Oww!

45:47.295 --> 45:51.356
Again, thank you all,
very, very much.

45:51.433 --> 45:53.424
<i>- Oh, stop it.
- You're too kind.
- Thank you.</i>

45:53.969 --> 45:55.960
You don't think I've offended
the warriors, do you?

45:56.071 --> 45:58.005
<i>You? No.</i>

45:58.073 --> 46:00.337
Oh, good. Because, you see,

46:00.409 --> 46:03.776
when you first brought them here,
I thought you'd hired a bunch of clowns.

46:03.846 --> 46:05.871
Ya did?

46:05.948 --> 46:07.882
<i>Don't tell 'em I said that.</i>

46:07.950 --> 46:11.283
<i>Boy, that's all I'd need,
another royal blunder like that.</i>

46:11.353 --> 46:14.845
- Princess, you're doin' a great job.
- Thanks, you're sweet.

46:14.924 --> 46:17.518
You're wrong, but sweet.

46:17.593 --> 46:20.221
<i>- I know what everyone really thinks.
- I don't follow you.</i>

46:20.296 --> 46:25.791
Everyone... the whole colony. Nobody
really believes I can do this job.

46:25.868 --> 46:28.530
<i>It's like they're all watching me,</i>

46:28.604 --> 46:32.870
- just, just...
- Waiting for you to screw up.

46:36.312 --> 46:39.406
- Flik, I owe you an apology.
- For what?

46:39.482 --> 46:43.441
Well, I haven't been that nice
to you, and... I'm sorry.

46:43.519 --> 46:45.453
If there's any way I can
make it up to you...

46:45.521 --> 46:47.455
Hey! I know!

46:47.523 --> 46:50.651
How would you like to be the queen's
official aide to the warrior bugs?

46:50.726 --> 46:54.162
- Me?
- Oh, sure. You've got
a great rapport with them,

46:54.230 --> 46:57.631
especially after that rescue...
it was very brave.

46:57.700 --> 47:01.067
- Really? Naw, naw...
- Well, not every bug would face a bird.

47:01.136 --> 47:04.799
- I mean, even Hopper's afraid of'em.
- Yeah, well, I guess maybe I...

47:04.874 --> 47:08.605
- Say that again?
- I said, even Hopper's afraid of birds.

47:11.982 --> 47:13.916
Thank you.

47:16.720 --> 47:19.245
- Hopper's afraid of birds!
- And I don't blame 'im!

47:19.322 --> 47:21.256
Oh, oh, oh,
this is perfect.

47:21.324 --> 47:24.157
We can get rid of Hopper,
and no one has to know that I messed up.

47:24.227 --> 47:26.320
You just keep pretending
you're warriors.

47:26.396 --> 47:29.888
Whoa, Flik, honey. We are not
about to fight grasshoppers, okay?

47:29.966 --> 47:33.493
You'll be gone before the grasshoppers
ever arrive. Here's what we do.

47:33.570 --> 47:35.504
Not another word.

47:35.572 --> 47:39.269
I don't know what you're concocting
in that little ant brain of yours,

47:39.342 --> 47:41.276
but we'll have no part of it.

47:41.344 --> 47:44.370
<i>Excuse me? Could we get
the warriors'autographs?</i>

47:44.447 --> 47:46.381
<i>Autographs? Ja!</i>

47:46.449 --> 47:49.885
- Wow! Great!
- So, you fellas catch the action today?

47:49.953 --> 47:52.012
Oh! The bird went...
And it just missed you!

47:52.088 --> 47:55.990
- Aren't you sweet?
- And the way you pretended
to be stuck in that crack!

47:56.059 --> 47:58.926
Oh, that's just all part of the plan.

47:58.995 --> 48:01.122
And then you dive-bombed
into the bush!

48:01.197 --> 48:04.598
- There you go, my boy.
- Wow! Thanks!

48:04.668 --> 48:06.636
"M-M-Maa-jor..."

48:06.703 --> 48:08.830
That's Major Manny, young cadet.

48:08.905 --> 48:12.966
- I outrank everyone here. Remember that.
- Yes, sir!

48:13.043 --> 48:14.977
- Dismissed!
- Wow!

48:15.045 --> 48:17.809
- When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a praying mantis!
- I'm gonna be a stick bug!

48:17.881 --> 48:20.111
<i>Oh, they're all so cool,
I can't pick!</i>

48:20.183 --> 48:25.416
Delightful lads.
You were saying, Flik?

48:25.488 --> 48:28.617
All right.
We are going to build a bird...

48:28.693 --> 48:32.322
a bird that we can operate
from the inside, which would then be...

48:32.396 --> 48:36.890
...hoisted above the anthill
and hidden high in the tree.

48:36.968 --> 48:39.937
Then, right when Hopper
and his gang are below,

48:40.004 --> 48:44.498
we'll launch the bird
and scare off the grasshoppers.

48:44.575 --> 48:46.873
Now it's going to take
everyone's involvement...

48:46.944 --> 48:49.276
...to make this plan
a reality.

48:49.347 --> 48:52.441
I know it's not our tradition
to do things differently,

48:52.516 --> 48:56.008
but if our ancestors were able
to build this anthill,

48:56.087 --> 49:00.547
we can certainly rally together
to build this bird!

49:23.014 --> 49:26.643
- Perfect!
- Okay, hit your marks!

49:43.368 --> 49:45.893
Hi, Flik.

49:53.011 --> 49:55.172
- I love what you did with your antenna.
- Oh, thank you.

49:55.247 --> 49:58.216
Oh, look.
She's a natural mother.

49:58.283 --> 50:01.548
All right, that's it!
Out! Everybody out!

50:03.789 --> 50:06.314
Now you're gonna cry, right?
See if I care. Go ahead, cry.

50:06.391 --> 50:08.689
Please, don't cry. Please.

50:14.733 --> 50:17.668
Ta-da!

50:20.739 --> 50:23.867
Okay, lower, lower...

50:23.942 --> 50:26.911
- You got it. And that's it!
- Whoa!

50:26.978 --> 50:31.039
Up, up, up, up!

50:31.116 --> 50:33.607
Rabbit through the hole, chicken in the
barn, two by two by, there's the yarn.

50:33.685 --> 50:35.619
- Done!
- Ruben Kincaid!

50:36.688 --> 50:40.146
- Hey!
- Good job, guys! Nice work!

50:42.461 --> 50:48.195
<i>Up, down.
Up, down. Up, down.</i>

50:52.804 --> 50:56.069
Ah-ah-ah. Read 'em and weep.

51:13.092 --> 51:15.151
<i>Flik, watch out!</i>

51:15.228 --> 51:18.493
Look! I'm a beautiful butterfly!

51:24.003 --> 51:28.099
<i>There ya go. Goodjob, fellas.
Keep up the good work.</i>

51:31.878 --> 51:34.073
Huh?

51:49.595 --> 51:51.825
Okay!

52:31.638 --> 52:34.903
You're fired!

52:43.550 --> 52:45.484
Yes!

52:53.994 --> 52:58.624
Look at me!
I'm barefootin'! Whoo-hoo!

52:58.699 --> 53:01.600
<i>Yo, bugito,
dos granitos, pronto!</i>

53:01.668 --> 53:04.398
You gotta try this, man!

53:08.976 --> 53:12.241
<i># La cucaracha, la cucaracha
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da #</i>

53:27.427 --> 53:32.092
<i>... all the way back there
and it starts to rain, we might
as well be suckin'bug spray.</i>

53:32.166 --> 53:34.657
Ooh, don't even say that!
You know somethin'?

53:34.736 --> 53:37.227
You're makin' a lot of sense.
I mean, why take the risk?

53:37.305 --> 53:40.297
- You should tell Hopper.
- Good idea.

53:40.375 --> 53:43.037
<i>But, you know,
it's really not our place.</i>

53:43.111 --> 53:46.342
You're his brother.
That makes you, like...

53:46.414 --> 53:48.575
the vice president of the gang.

53:48.650 --> 53:50.550
Wow! It kinda does,
doesn't it?

53:50.685 --> 53:54.678
Okay, I'll tell 'im.
I should talk to you guys more often.

53:54.756 --> 53:58.624
- What if Hopper doesn't like it?
- Then the genius'll get smacked
and not us.

53:58.693 --> 54:01.491
Vice President Molt.

54:01.562 --> 54:04.690
Ooh, yeah, that's good.
Oh, that's good.

54:04.766 --> 54:08.759
- Ooh, a little lower. Ahh, lower.
- Hey ya, Hop.

54:08.836 --> 54:11.634
- Go away.
- That's fine.
Then I won't tell ya my idea.

54:11.706 --> 54:13.640
- Good!
- Okay, okay. I'll tell ya anyway.

54:13.708 --> 54:16.973
I've been thinkin'... which is somethin'
I do, bein' vice president and all.

54:17.045 --> 54:21.038
<i>This is a thought, and it was mine:
Why go back to Ant Island at all?</i>

54:21.115 --> 54:23.049
<i>- You don't even like grain.
- What?</i>

54:23.117 --> 54:25.585
You're right. I didn't think
it was such a good idea myself.

54:25.653 --> 54:28.281
It wasn't even my idea.
It was Axle and Loco's!

54:28.356 --> 54:30.984
They talked fancy to me.
I got confused!

54:31.059 --> 54:35.587
<i># La cucaracha, la cucaracha #</i>

54:42.070 --> 54:45.562
Guys, order another round...

54:45.640 --> 54:48.201
because we're stayin' here!

54:48.277 --> 54:50.438
Yeah!

54:50.512 --> 54:54.915
What was I thinking?
Going back to Ant Island.

54:54.984 --> 54:56.918
I mean, we just got here,

54:56.986 --> 54:59.318
and we have more than enough food
to get us through the winter.

54:59.388 --> 55:01.322
<i>Right? Why go back?</i>

55:04.860 --> 55:08.796
But there was that ant
that stood up to me.

55:08.864 --> 55:12.630
- Yeah, but we can forget about him!
- Yeah, it was just one ant.

55:12.701 --> 55:15.033
- Ooo-oooh!
- One ant!

55:15.104 --> 55:20.007
Yeah, you're right!
It's just one ant!

55:20.075 --> 55:23.875
- Yeah, boss. They're puny!
- Hmm, puny.

55:23.946 --> 55:28.679
Say, let's pretend this grain
is a puny little ant.

55:28.751 --> 55:31.549
<i>- Didn't that hurt?
- Nope.</i>

55:31.620 --> 55:35.056
- Well, how 'bout this one?
- Are you kiddin'?

55:35.124 --> 55:38.389
Well, how 'bout this?

55:50.339 --> 55:53.502
You let one ant stand up to us,

55:53.575 --> 55:56.567
<i>then they all might stand up.</i>

55:56.645 --> 56:01.673
Those puny little ants
outnumber us a hundred to one.

56:01.750 --> 56:06.654
And if they ever figure that out,
there goes our way of life!

56:06.723 --> 56:12.252
It's not about food.
It's about keeping those ants in line.

56:12.328 --> 56:15.263
That's why we're going back!

56:15.331 --> 56:17.526
Does anybody else wanna stay?

56:19.836 --> 56:22.862
He's quite the motivational
speaker, isn't he?

56:24.307 --> 56:26.741
Let's ride!

56:42.192 --> 56:44.490
<i>- To the bird!
- The bird!</i>

56:54.170 --> 56:56.104
Get down, roly boys!

56:56.172 --> 56:59.232
- How low can you go? Sing it now.
- # How low can you go #

56:59.309 --> 57:01.504
Do it, Princess. # How low can you go #

57:01.578 --> 57:03.978
And that's how my 12th husband died.

57:04.047 --> 57:06.675
So, now I'm a widow. I mean,
I've always been a black widow,

57:06.749 --> 57:10.276
<i>but now I'm a black widow widow.</i>

57:12.689 --> 57:15.180
Whoo!

57:16.860 --> 57:21.298
<i>- Thorny! Any sign of those fiends?
- Lemme check.</i>

57:24.468 --> 57:27.232
No, not yet.
But we'll be ready for 'em.

57:27.304 --> 57:30.137
Blueberries, dismissed!

57:30.207 --> 57:33.176
And, uh, quit beatin' the boys up.

57:33.244 --> 57:36.645
Those little raisins
do grow on ya.

57:36.714 --> 57:38.807
Hey, how you guys doin'?
Some party, huh?

57:38.883 --> 57:41.852
Is that grain dip fresh or what?

57:41.919 --> 57:44.149
Okay, I've told everyone you'll be
stationed deep in the command bunker.

57:44.221 --> 57:47.679
Party quiets down,
I sneak you out the back way
and then you're outta here forever.

57:49.527 --> 57:52.758
Dim don't wanna go.

57:52.830 --> 57:56.527
<i>Well, if Dim stays he's gonna
need me here. He's not fully trained.</i>

57:56.600 --> 57:58.534
I mean, house-trained.

57:58.602 --> 58:02.368
I, uh, I kinda promised the Blueberries
I'd teach 'em canasta.

58:02.439 --> 58:06.899
It seems we've been booked
for an extended engagement.

58:10.047 --> 58:14.211
<i>Will you look at this colony?
Will you just look at this colony?</i>

58:14.285 --> 58:16.480
I don't even recognize it.

58:16.554 --> 58:18.852
I feel 70 again!

58:18.923 --> 58:23.121
Work that ab, baby!

58:23.194 --> 58:26.721
And I have you bugs to thank for it.
So... thank you!

58:26.797 --> 58:29.891
And, uh, thank you
for findin' 'em, Flik.

58:29.967 --> 58:32.197
Me? Oh, ooh...
uh, uh, I'll get it.

58:32.269 --> 58:34.203
I mean, if you don't mind,
I'll just...

58:34.271 --> 58:36.206
It's all tangled up.

58:36.274 --> 58:38.435
- There.
- Ow!

58:38.510 --> 58:40.740
I think I'll go check
on the bird.

58:43.248 --> 58:45.978
<i>- Bird's this way.
Yeah, the bird's that way.</i>

58:46.051 --> 58:49.077
She... What?

58:57.395 --> 59:00.455
Jiminy H. Cricket!

59:03.034 --> 59:06.265
<i>They're back!
Get ready, everybody!</i>

59:06.338 --> 59:08.806
<i>Get to your posts!</i>

59:08.873 --> 59:11.774
Battle stations, everyone.
This not a drill.

59:11.843 --> 59:16.610
Come on, everyone. You know your jobs!
Let's go, go, go, go!

59:16.681 --> 59:19.741
Look out!

59:21.253 --> 59:23.244
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa there.
Steady, girls. That's it.

59:23.321 --> 59:26.313
- Oh, it's P.T.
- P.T.?

59:26.391 --> 59:30.953
Greetings and salutations!
Ooh-boppa-doo and how do you do?

59:31.029 --> 59:35.398
I am the great P.T. Flea!

59:35.467 --> 59:38.664
I'm in need of your assis...
Oh, let's just cut to the chase.

59:38.737 --> 59:42.104
<i>Look, I've been goin'
from anthill to anthill.</i>

59:42.173 --> 59:45.472
I'm lookin' for a bunch of circus
performers. Have you seen 'em?

59:48.713 --> 59:51.512
Wait a second.
Ain't that Staff Sergeant Slim?

59:51.584 --> 59:53.711
No, no, no. I'm sorry, no, but uh...

59:53.786 --> 59:55.720
<i>Be quiet!</i>

59:55.788 --> 59:57.881
Hey!

59:57.957 --> 59:59.788
<i> You'll probably...
you'll probably want to get goin'!</i>

59:59.859 --> 01:00:03.124
I guess you got a lot of other anthills
to check into, so, bye!

01:00:03.195 --> 01:00:06.460
- Ah, guys, I've been lookin'
all over for ya!

01:00:06.532 --> 01:00:10.059
- Flaming Death is a huge hit!
- P.T! Sh...

01:00:10.136 --> 01:00:12.400
<i>- I'm serious. Word of mouth got around.
- P. T..! No!</i>

01:00:12.471 --> 01:00:14.962
The next day, there was a line of flies
outside the tent went on forever!

01:00:15.041 --> 01:00:16.975
<i>- It must have been a foot long!
- P. T., no!</i>

01:00:17.043 --> 01:00:20.342
So, I figured it out. You guys burn me
twice a night, I take a day off to heal,

01:00:20.413 --> 01:00:22.347
and then we do it
all over again!

01:00:22.415 --> 01:00:25.646
We'll be the top circus act
in the business!

01:00:25.718 --> 01:00:27.652
You mean, you're not warriors?

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:32.748
Are you kiddin'? These guys are the
lousiest circus bugs you've ever seen.

01:00:32.825 --> 01:00:35.259
And they're gonna make me rich!

01:00:35.328 --> 01:00:38.388
You mean to tell me that
our entire defensive strategy...

01:00:38.464 --> 01:00:40.864
was concocted by clowns?

01:00:40.933 --> 01:00:43.094
Hey, hey, hey, hey. We really thought
Flik's idea was gonna work.

01:00:46.739 --> 01:00:49.902
- Oops.
- Tell me this isn't true.

01:00:49.975 --> 01:00:52.944
- No, you don't... You don't...
- This couldn't have happened
at a more inopportune time!

01:00:53.012 --> 01:00:54.946
The last leaf is about to fall!

01:00:55.014 --> 01:00:57.312
<i> We haven't collected
any food for the grasshoppers!</i>

01:00:57.383 --> 01:00:59.613
<i>If Hopper finds out
what we almost did...</i>

01:00:59.685 --> 01:01:02.813
<i>Hopper is not going
to find out.</i>

01:01:02.888 --> 01:01:06.346
We're going to hide all this,
and pretend it never happened.

01:01:06.425 --> 01:01:10.328
You bugs were never here.
So I suggest you all leave.

01:01:10.397 --> 01:01:12.957
But the bird!
The-The bird will work.

01:01:13.033 --> 01:01:17.265
I never thought I'd see the day
when an ant would put himself...

01:01:17.337 --> 01:01:20.397
<i>- before the rest ofhis colony.
- What?</i>

01:01:20.474 --> 01:01:24.035
- The point is, Flik, you lied to us.
- No, no, no! I-I...

01:01:24.111 --> 01:01:26.875
You lied, Flik. You lied to her.

01:01:26.947 --> 01:01:30.542
<i>You lied to the colony!
You lied to me!</i>

01:01:30.617 --> 01:01:32.812
And like an idiot,
I believed you.

01:01:32.886 --> 01:01:36.549
But I-I was just afraid that...

01:01:36.623 --> 01:01:40.821
if you knew I'd gotten circus bugs...

01:01:40.894 --> 01:01:45.388
<i>- I just wanted to make a difference.
- I want you to leave, Flik.</i>

01:01:45.465 --> 01:01:48.901
And this time, don't come back.

01:01:59.546 --> 01:02:02.674
Tough crowd. Yee-haw!

01:02:02.749 --> 01:02:05.115
Flik!

01:02:30.945 --> 01:02:34.039
<i>Get those bugs!</i>

01:02:58.105 --> 01:03:01.006
That's it? But there's got
to be more food on the island!

01:03:01.075 --> 01:03:03.009
If we give up any more,
we'll starve.

01:03:03.077 --> 01:03:05.637
Hopper won't accept this!

01:03:11.052 --> 01:03:13.987
Mother, it's not enough.

01:03:14.055 --> 01:03:16.523
- What do we do?
- I-I don't know.

01:03:46.655 --> 01:03:49.681
You little termites!

01:03:49.758 --> 01:03:53.592
I give you a second chance,
and this is all I get?

01:03:53.662 --> 01:03:57.860
But Hopper, we ran out of time!

01:03:57.933 --> 01:04:01.699
Have you been playing all summer?
You think this is a game?

01:04:01.770 --> 01:04:05.206
- No, no, please!
- Well, guess what?

01:04:05.274 --> 01:04:07.242
You just lost.

01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:10.904
Not one ant sleeps...

01:04:10.979 --> 01:04:14.346
until we get
every scrap of food...

01:04:14.416 --> 01:04:16.782
on this island!

01:04:16.852 --> 01:04:19.821
Just do what he says. You don't
want to make him mad. Believe me!

01:04:21.590 --> 01:04:24.821
No, no, no.
You're staying with me, Your Highness.

01:04:24.893 --> 01:04:26.884
What do you think you're doing?

01:04:27.129 --> 01:04:30.792
- Get over there.
- Quick! To the clubhouse.

01:04:36.338 --> 01:04:38.636
Hurry!

01:04:47.482 --> 01:04:49.882
<i>Shut up a minute, will ya?</i>

01:04:49.952 --> 01:04:53.285
<i>- I think I heard something over here.
- Have you checked over there?</i>

01:04:53.355 --> 01:04:57.258
- No, not yet.
- Then get over there and check it out!

01:04:57.327 --> 01:04:59.420
Wait a minute.

01:04:59.495 --> 01:05:02.760
Hey, I think I found something.

01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:07.302
Cool. Hey, how do I look?

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:09.304
Like an idiot.

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:11.306
Oh, I don't know, maybe
it'll keep me dry in the rain.

01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:14.343
You moron, we'll be out of here
before it rains.

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:17.345
Didn't you hear Hopper?
After the ants pick all the food,

01:05:17.413 --> 01:05:19.711
<i>he's gonna squish the queen
to remind 'em who's boss.</i>

01:05:19.782 --> 01:05:23.650
<i>Then she's dead. They cry... boo-hoo...
we go home. End of story.</i>

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:26.951
Oh! Cool. I love our job.

01:05:27.023 --> 01:05:30.049
Stay here.
I'm gonna get help.

01:06:14.972 --> 01:06:17.634
Come on, wings, fly. Fly!

01:06:50.274 --> 01:06:52.208
# I'm gonna be
rich, rich, rich #

01:06:52.276 --> 01:06:56.372
# I'm gonna be rich, rich, rich
I'm gonna be the richest flea
in the land #

01:06:56.447 --> 01:07:01.316
Ka-ching! #The streets'll
be paved with golden retrievers #

01:07:01.385 --> 01:07:03.717
<i>#I'm rich, rich, rich
That's who I am ##</i>

01:07:08.058 --> 01:07:11.289
- Poor fellow.
- Hey, maybe we can cheer him up a bit.

01:07:12.663 --> 01:07:16.827
Don't worry, Flik.
The circus life isn't so bad.

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:19.494
- Yes, you can be part of our act.
- Here! Like this.

01:07:19.570 --> 01:07:24.166
Oof! Ahh.
Slapstick! Get it?

01:07:24.241 --> 01:07:28.645
<i>I- I'm a walkingstick.
 Oh, never mind.</i>

01:07:28.713 --> 01:07:30.647
<i>- Flik!
- Dot?</i>

01:07:30.715 --> 01:07:33.650
Flik, wait! Wait!

01:07:33.718 --> 01:07:36.846
Dot, you're flying!
What are you doing here?

01:07:36.921 --> 01:07:39.151
You... have to go back.

01:07:39.224 --> 01:07:41.158
Hopper moved into the anthill,

01:07:41.226 --> 01:07:43.251
and his gang's eating everything!

01:07:43.328 --> 01:07:45.262
- Oh, no!
- Good heavens!

01:07:45.330 --> 01:07:47.662
And I heard a grasshopper say
that when they're finished,

01:07:47.732 --> 01:07:49.825
Hopper's gonna squish my mom!

01:07:49.901 --> 01:07:52.529
- Oh, not the queen!
- Do something!
- How?

01:07:52.604 --> 01:07:55.801
<i>- Come on, you guys, think!
- I know. The bird.</i>

01:07:55.874 --> 01:07:57.933
- Yes, of course.
- The bird! That's brilliant.

01:07:58.009 --> 01:08:01.501
<i>- Ja!
- The bird won't work.</i>

01:08:01.579 --> 01:08:03.979
- What are you talking about?
It was your idea.
- But you said that everything...

01:08:04.048 --> 01:08:06.676
Forget everything I ever told you.
All right, Dot?

01:08:06.751 --> 01:08:10.983
<i>Let's face it. The colony is right.
I just make things worse.</i>

01:08:11.055 --> 01:08:14.252
That bird is a guaranteed failure.

01:08:14.325 --> 01:08:16.486
Just like me.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:21.122
You listen to me, my boy. I've made
a living out of being a failure.

01:08:21.198 --> 01:08:23.326
<i>And you, sir, are not a failure!</i>

01:08:23.401 --> 01:08:26.461
- Oh, but Flik, you've
done so many good things.
- Oh, yeah?

01:08:26.537 --> 01:08:28.471
Okay, show me one thing
I've done right.

01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:32.408
- Umm...
- Us.

01:08:32.477 --> 01:08:34.968
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Dim is right, my boy.</i>

01:08:35.046 --> 01:08:39.983
You have rekindled the long-dormant
embers of purpose in our lives.

01:08:40.051 --> 01:08:44.010
And if it wasn't for you,
Francis would have never gotten
in touch with his feminine side.

01:08:44.087 --> 01:08:46.148
Oh yeah? Well... Hmm.

01:08:46.225 --> 01:08:48.158
You know what? He's right.

01:08:48.227 --> 01:08:50.821
Lieutenant Gypsy
reporting for duty.

01:08:50.895 --> 01:08:54.832
- Kid, say the word
and we'll follow you into battle.
- We believe in you, my boy.

01:08:54.899 --> 01:08:56.890
Flik, please?

01:09:22.461 --> 01:09:24.725
Pretend it's a seed, okay?

01:09:29.734 --> 01:09:32.795
Thanks, Dot.

01:09:37.542 --> 01:09:40.511
- Hey, what's with the rock?
- Must be an ant thing.

01:09:40.578 --> 01:09:43.274
All right, let's do it.

01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:45.283
That's the Flik we know and love.

01:09:45.350 --> 01:09:47.341
- We're on!
- So, what do we do first?

01:09:48.988 --> 01:09:51.923
# Bugs will pay
big bucks to see #

01:09:51.991 --> 01:09:54.926
#A bonfire that is starring me ##

01:09:54.994 --> 01:09:57.121
P.T., look. Money!

01:09:57.196 --> 01:09:59.027
<i>Where? Where? </i>

01:10:01.568 --> 01:10:06.801
All right. Get movin'! Get goin'.
Move your abdomens, now!

01:10:06.873 --> 01:10:08.807
<i>They're rounding everyone up.</i>

01:10:10.076 --> 01:10:12.010
Hey! Turn your butt off.

01:10:14.047 --> 01:10:15.947
Psst! Hey, guys!
Get me out of this thing, will ya?

01:10:16.016 --> 01:10:17.950
I promise to start thinkin'
about payin' ya.

01:10:18.018 --> 01:10:20.714
<i>Hey! Wait, wait!
Okay, I'll pay ya! I'll pay ya!</i>

01:10:20.787 --> 01:10:24.052
<i> Oh, no!
They've finished collecting the food.</i>

01:10:24.124 --> 01:10:26.319
<i>We've got to get the queen now.</i>

01:10:26.393 --> 01:10:29.021
Once she's safe,
we move on Gypsy's signal.

01:10:34.167 --> 01:10:36.567
Someone's coming!

01:10:38.705 --> 01:10:42.106
Hello, kids! Ready to make
some grasshoppers cry?

01:10:42.175 --> 01:10:45.144
It's payback time,
Blueberry-style.

01:10:45.211 --> 01:10:47.145
Blueberries rock!

01:10:47.213 --> 01:10:48.976
All right!

01:10:51.217 --> 01:10:54.914
<i> Ladies and Gentlebugs!
Larvae of all stages!</i>

01:10:54.988 --> 01:10:59.357
<i>Rub your legs together for
the world's greatest bug circus!</i>

01:11:09.970 --> 01:11:13.371
Wait a minute.

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:16.706
- I think I'm going to wet myself.
- Steady...

01:11:16.777 --> 01:11:19.712
- What's going on here?
- Well, uh...

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:21.714
<i>Uh, yes.</i>

01:11:21.782 --> 01:11:24.410
We were invited
by Princess Atta...

01:11:24.485 --> 01:11:27.852
<i>as a surprise for your arrival.</i>

01:11:27.922 --> 01:11:29.947
Squish 'em.

01:11:31.192 --> 01:11:33.387
Ooh...

01:11:34.729 --> 01:11:38.631
Hey!

01:11:47.942 --> 01:11:49.876
<i>Now that's funny.</i>

01:11:49.944 --> 01:11:51.809
<i>That is funny.</i>

01:11:53.614 --> 01:11:56.310
I guess we could use
a little entertainment.

01:11:56.384 --> 01:11:59.444
Looks like you did something right
for once, Princess.

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:03.479
- On with the show!
- Hi-ya!

01:12:03.557 --> 01:12:05.650
Hey!

01:12:05.726 --> 01:12:08.820
#The circus, the circus
I love the circus #

01:12:21.242 --> 01:12:23.972
Ba-ba all gone!

01:12:24.045 --> 01:12:26.343
Baby wants pie!

01:12:26.414 --> 01:12:30.282
Pie? He asked for it.
Should I give it to him?

01:12:30.351 --> 01:12:33.412
Yeah! Give 'em pie!
Give 'em pie!

01:12:33.488 --> 01:12:35.786
Yeah! Hah!

01:12:35.857 --> 01:12:37.984
Thank you, gentlemen.
Always an intellectual treat.

01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:40.688
Say, how many roaches does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

01:12:40.762 --> 01:12:43.196
Can't tell. As soon as
the light goes on, they scatter!

01:12:57.712 --> 01:12:59.942
Ah, almost there.

01:13:00.015 --> 01:13:03.644
From the most mysterious
regions of uncharted Asia,

01:13:03.718 --> 01:13:06.380
<i>- I give you the Chinese Cabinet...
- Come on, girls. Quick. Quick.</i>

01:13:06.455 --> 01:13:09.583
<i>Of Metamorphosis!</i>

01:13:09.658 --> 01:13:12.218
Utilizing psychic vibrations,

01:13:12.294 --> 01:13:15.923
- Ooh, ohh, pick me!
- I shall select the perfect volunteer.

01:13:15.997 --> 01:13:18.727
Ooh, no! Come on,
I'm askin' ya with my brain.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:22.736
- Aha! Why, Your Majesty!
- Me?

01:13:22.804 --> 01:13:25.500
No, no. Thumper, down. Let her go.

01:13:25.574 --> 01:13:27.508
Maybe he'll saw her in half.

01:13:27.576 --> 01:13:31.273
As you ascend the dung beetle
to the unknown,

01:13:31.346 --> 01:13:35.476
put your trust in the mysteries that
are beyond mere mortal comprehension.

01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:38.314
Ooh, this is gonna be good!

01:13:40.122 --> 01:13:42.090
- Blueberries ready?
- Ready.

01:13:42.157 --> 01:13:44.717
- Ready!
- Shh!

01:13:44.793 --> 01:13:47.853
I call upon the ancient
Szechwan spirits...

01:13:47.929 --> 01:13:50.990
<i>to inhabit the body
of our volunteer!</i>

01:13:51.067 --> 01:13:53.535
No, no.
Just stay in there, Your Majesty.

01:13:53.603 --> 01:13:55.833
Transformation.

01:13:55.905 --> 01:13:58.396
Transformation!

01:13:58.474 --> 01:14:00.567
<i>Transformation!</i>

01:14:00.643 --> 01:14:02.838
Wow.
Manny's gettin' good.

01:14:02.912 --> 01:14:06.370
- Not now.
- If it rains, that bird'll
get ripped to shreds!

01:14:10.953 --> 01:14:14.719
<i>And now, insectus...</i>

01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:18.123
<i>transformitus!</i>

01:14:24.433 --> 01:14:26.424
Ooh, pretty!

01:14:26.502 --> 01:14:30.097
Thank you, thank you.

01:14:30.173 --> 01:14:33.074
<i>- Thank you.
- That's the signal. That's the signal!</i>

01:14:36.179 --> 01:14:38.977
This is it, girls.
Get ready to roll.

01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:44.112
- Huh? It's stuck!
- That was amazing!

01:14:44.187 --> 01:14:48.146
I have no... How did they do that?
I have no idea where she went.

01:14:48.224 --> 01:14:50.715
<i>- Thank you. Thank you, thank you.
- More, more, more!</i>

01:14:50.793 --> 01:14:53.626
Wait!

01:14:53.696 --> 01:14:56.563
- Where is she?
- Well, now, uh, actually...

01:14:56.632 --> 01:15:00.500
I am sorry. A magician
never reveals his secrets.

01:15:00.570 --> 01:15:03.505
That's very true, Hoppy. Where would the
mystery be if we all knew how it was...

01:15:03.573 --> 01:15:06.042
Shutting up.

01:15:06.109 --> 01:15:09.408
- You can do it!
You've got to make it work!
- Hey!

01:15:10.747 --> 01:15:12.840
I said, where is she?

01:15:12.916 --> 01:15:15.146
Ohh!

01:15:22.593 --> 01:15:24.584
Hold on!

01:15:34.004 --> 01:15:36.336
Bird! It's a bird!

01:15:53.357 --> 01:15:57.623
Let's get out of here! Go!

01:16:02.032 --> 01:16:06.059
Don't let it get me!
Don't let it get me!

01:16:06.136 --> 01:16:08.070
Help me! Aaah!

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.174
<i>Up, down, up, down.</i>

01:16:12.242 --> 01:16:15.143
And turn!

01:16:25.823 --> 01:16:28.883
Oh, my eye! Help me!

01:16:33.765 --> 01:16:35.926
Mmm, boysenberry.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.027
Huh?
Aah, no, no, no, no, no!

01:16:43.975 --> 01:16:48.742
Oh, the pain!

01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:51.247
There goes my magic act!

01:16:52.317 --> 01:16:55.343
- Flaming gas!
- No! P.T!

01:17:00.825 --> 01:17:03.123
A direct hit! Ah-hee-ha!

01:17:03.194 --> 01:17:05.128
Run!

01:17:05.196 --> 01:17:07.790
Flik! Help us!

01:17:27.819 --> 01:17:29.218
Dot!

01:17:31.556 --> 01:17:33.888
Okay! Everyone out! Hurry!

01:17:36.561 --> 01:17:38.496
Where's Dot?
Anyone seen Dot?

01:17:40.232 --> 01:17:44.566
Whose idea was this?

01:17:44.636 --> 01:17:46.570
Huh?

01:17:48.006 --> 01:17:50.270
Was it yours, Princess?

01:17:50.342 --> 01:17:53.004
Just get behind me, girls.
It'll be okay.

01:17:53.078 --> 01:17:55.012
<i>Leave her alone, Hopper.</i>

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:59.107
The bird was my idea.
I'm the one you want.

01:18:12.331 --> 01:18:14.322
Ohh.

01:18:18.270 --> 01:18:20.670
Where do you get the gall
to do this to me?

01:18:20.739 --> 01:18:24.539
You were...
You were gonna squish the queen.

01:18:24.610 --> 01:18:27.204
It's true.

01:18:27.279 --> 01:18:30.009
I hate it when someone
gives away the ending.

01:18:32.084 --> 01:18:35.485
You piece of dirt!
No, I'm wrong.

01:18:35.554 --> 01:18:38.546
You're lower than dirt.
You're an ant!

01:18:39.691 --> 01:18:43.218
<i>Let this be a lesson
to all you ants.</i>

01:18:43.295 --> 01:18:46.458
Ideas are very dangerous things.

01:18:46.532 --> 01:18:49.990
<i>You are mindless,
soil-shoving losers,</i>

01:18:50.068 --> 01:18:54.062
put on this earth to serve us!

01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:57.007
<i>You're wrong, Hopper.</i>

01:19:03.147 --> 01:19:08.278
Ants are not meant
to serve grasshoppers!

01:19:12.056 --> 01:19:15.321
I've seen these ants
do great things.

01:19:15.393 --> 01:19:17.861
And year after year,
they somehow manage...

01:19:17.929 --> 01:19:21.490
<i>to pick food
for themselves and you.</i>

01:19:24.235 --> 01:19:26.669
<i>So-So who is the weaker species?</i>

01:19:28.139 --> 01:19:30.232
Ants don't serve grasshoppers.

01:19:30.308 --> 01:19:33.106
<i>It's you who need us.</i>

01:19:38.683 --> 01:19:41.846
We're a lot stronger
than you say we are.

01:19:41.919 --> 01:19:45.150
And you know it, don't you?

01:19:54.432 --> 01:19:57.367
Well, Princess!

01:19:57.435 --> 01:20:00.199
Umm, Hopper?
I hate to interrupt, but, um...

01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:08.777
You ants stay back!

01:20:14.553 --> 01:20:17.716
<i>- Oh, this was such a bad idea!
- You see, Hopper,</i>

01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:20.520
nature has a certain order.

01:20:20.592 --> 01:20:24.653
<i>The ants pick the food,
the ants keep the food,</i>

01:20:24.730 --> 01:20:26.960
and the grasshoppers leave!

01:20:32.304 --> 01:20:35.705
- I'm so proud of you, Flik!
- Charge-a!

01:20:35.774 --> 01:20:37.935
Where are you going?
They're just ants!

01:20:38.010 --> 01:20:40.069
Oof!

01:20:43.482 --> 01:20:46.315
No! Bad grasshopper!
Bad grasshopper! Go home!

01:20:52.090 --> 01:20:53.648
Yeah!

01:20:53.725 --> 01:20:57.320
<i> Come back here,
you cowards! Don't leave!</i>

01:20:57.396 --> 01:20:59.523
- To the cannon!
- To the cannon!

01:20:59.598 --> 01:21:02.226
No!

01:21:11.143 --> 01:21:12.838
Happy landings, Hopper!

01:21:14.146 --> 01:21:16.080
Huh?

01:21:24.089 --> 01:21:27.082
Rain!

01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:56.050
- Flik!
- Quick! After them!

01:21:56.122 --> 01:21:58.454
- Yaah!
- Aah! Aah!

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:10.096
Aah! Slim!

01:22:10.169 --> 01:22:12.637
<i>- Francis! Francis! Francis, I'm stuck!
- Where are ya?</i>

01:22:12.705 --> 01:22:14.639
<i>- I'm over here! Here!
- Where?</i>

01:22:14.707 --> 01:22:16.971
<i>I'm the only stick with eyeballs!</i>

01:22:20.179 --> 01:22:22.875
- Help! Help!
- Get him!

01:22:29.255 --> 01:22:32.691
Yes! Yes!

01:22:35.828 --> 01:22:37.455
No!

01:22:49.944 --> 01:22:54.313
- Go that way! I've got an idea!
- But the anthill's over...

01:22:59.753 --> 01:23:01.687
- Flik!
- Come on!

01:23:07.094 --> 01:23:09.358
There!

01:23:12.733 --> 01:23:14.667
Come on!
We've gotta hide!

01:23:14.735 --> 01:23:17.670
No matter what happens,
stay down!

01:23:17.738 --> 01:23:19.672
Flik, no!
What are you doing?

01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:24.200
- Uh... Hopper!
- You think it's over?

01:23:24.278 --> 01:23:26.212
No, no, no.
No, I-I can explain.

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:29.716
- All your little stunt did
was buy them time!
- No, please!

01:23:29.783 --> 01:23:31.216
Please, Hopper!

01:23:31.285 --> 01:23:34.311
I'll get more grasshoppers
and be back next season,

01:23:34.388 --> 01:23:36.618
but you won't!

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:42.388
Well, what's this?

01:23:42.429 --> 01:23:44.829
Another one of
your little bird tricks?

01:23:44.898 --> 01:23:48.334
- Yup.
- Are there a bunch of little
girls in this one too?

01:23:48.402 --> 01:23:50.870
Hello, girls!

01:23:59.848 --> 01:24:02.009
<i>No! No!
No, no, no, no!</i>

01:24:02.083 --> 01:24:06.383
No! Aah!
No!

01:24:06.454 --> 01:24:09.389
Oh, no!

01:24:09.457 --> 01:24:13.826
<i>Oh, no! No, no, no!</i>

01:24:23.338 --> 01:24:25.568
Come on, boys!

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:28.074
Hey, Princess Dot! Wait up!

01:24:30.945 --> 01:24:33.209
I finally get a second to relax,

01:24:33.281 --> 01:24:35.215
and I gotta get out of my chair.

01:24:35.283 --> 01:24:39.447
- Come on! You can rub lotion
on me later, shade boy.
- Yeah, hubba-hubba.

01:24:41.556 --> 01:24:45.549
Oh, thank you!

01:24:45.627 --> 01:24:47.891
- Oh, you're too kind!
- It was the least we could do.
All in a day's work.

01:24:47.962 --> 01:24:49.896
Dim!

01:24:49.964 --> 01:24:52.159
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

01:24:52.233 --> 01:24:54.633
I'm so sorry, kids.
I wish you could come along too.

01:24:54.703 --> 01:24:57.171
I'm not gonna cry. I'm not gonna cry.

01:25:05.547 --> 01:25:07.913
Hey, let's go. We got a schedule
to keep. Come on, let's go.

01:25:07.982 --> 01:25:10.246
- Hup, hup, hey!
- Hey, Tiny!
Let's get this show packed up!

01:25:10.318 --> 01:25:12.252
We got paying customers hatching!

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.585
Yes, Mr. Flea. Yes, sir.
Of course, sir. Right away, sir.

01:25:14.657 --> 01:25:16.591
And, um, I just wanted to
thank you for giving me a chance,

01:25:16.659 --> 01:25:19.150
because it's an honor to work
with creative giants such as yourself.

01:25:19.228 --> 01:25:22.755
<i>- Shutting up.
- You sure you can't
come on tour with us?</i>

01:25:22.832 --> 01:25:27.394
- Sorry. My place is here.
- Good answer.

01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:30.667
Oh, well. Your loss.
One minute, insects!

01:25:32.341 --> 01:25:34.275
I wanna thank all of you...

01:25:34.343 --> 01:25:38.939
for giving us back our hope,
our dignity, and our lives.

01:25:39.048 --> 01:25:43.212
And to you, Princess Atta.
You have given us so much.

01:25:43.252 --> 01:25:46.380
Please accept this gift
from us bugs...

01:25:46.455 --> 01:25:49.185
to you ants.

01:25:49.258 --> 01:25:54.286
- For you!
- Oh! It's a rock.

01:25:54.363 --> 01:25:56.831
What's with the rock?

01:25:56.899 --> 01:25:58.833
Must be a circus thing.

01:26:01.137 --> 01:26:03.503
Well, Flik, you really goofed up.

01:26:03.572 --> 01:26:07.508
- Thanks.
- Yeah, you too.

01:26:44.214 --> 01:26:48.344
- All right.
Now it's gettin' mushy.

01:26:48.418 --> 01:26:51.683
We're outta here! Hy-aah!

01:26:57.527 --> 01:27:01.054
- Whoa!
- See ya next season!

01:27:01.131 --> 01:27:03.691
- See ya, Flik!
- Bye! We miss you already!

01:27:03.767 --> 01:27:07.100
- You fired!
- We forgot Heimlich!

01:27:10.574 --> 01:27:15.602
I'm finished! Finally,
I'm a beautiful butterfly!

01:27:22.352 --> 01:27:25.344
<i>Mein wings!
Oh, they're beautiful!</i>

01:27:25.422 --> 01:27:28.687
Heimlich! The wagon's
taking off! You better start flying!

01:27:28.758 --> 01:27:34.287
<i>But I am flying! And from way up here,
you all look like little ants!</i>

01:27:34.364 --> 01:27:36.958
Auf Wiedersehen!

01:27:37.033 --> 01:27:38.830
Bye!

01:27:45.675 --> 01:27:48.770
Present stalks!

01:27:48.846 --> 01:27:51.906
Harvester, salute!

01:28:34.258 --> 01:28:37.659
<i># Was a bug, little bug #</i>

01:28:37.728 --> 01:28:39.855

<i>#How he felt, what he dreamed #</i>

01:28:45.369 --> 01:28:47.303
<i># Who would care #</i>

01:28:49.707 --> 01:28:53.507
<i>- # Without any evidence #

<i>- #He was full of confidence #
- #Some people haven't any #</i>

01:28:57.715 --> 01:29:01.481

01:30:01.313 --> 01:30:04.578
- No!
- Do I look stupid... to you?

01:30:06.918 --> 01:30:08.852
I'm sorry!

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:12.447
Are you saying I'm stupid? Oh...

01:30:15.894 --> 01:30:19.262
I'm sorry! I got it.
No, no. Do it again. I'm fine.

01:30:19.332 --> 01:30:23.325
- Are you saying I'm stupid?
- Yes!

01:30:23.403 --> 01:30:27.203
This is the 15th take.
I cannot work like this.

01:30:27.273 --> 01:30:30.640
- I will be in my trailer.
- I need a break.

01:30:30.710 --> 01:30:32.644
Marker.

01:30:32.712 --> 01:30:35.943
Whoa, Flik honey, we are not about to...

01:30:36.015 --> 01:30:37.949
Is someone hammering?

01:30:38.017 --> 01:30:39.951
Could we hold the work, please? People?

01:30:40.053 --> 01:30:42.044
Am I in this shot?
You can see me, right?

01:30:42.088 --> 01:30:44.613
<i>And... action!</i>

01:30:44.690 --> 01:30:47.625
To infinity, and beyond!

01:30:47.693 --> 01:30:51.959
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

01:30:52.031 --> 01:30:53.965
Really, can you blame me?

01:30:54.033 --> 01:30:57.434
<i>- Okay, let's go for real now. Sorry.
- Okay, cut!</i>

01:30:57.503 --> 01:31:00.131
Why go back to Ant Island at all?

01:31:00.206 --> 01:31:02.140
- I mean, you don't even like grain.
- What?

01:31:02.208 --> 01:31:04.142
You're right. I didn't think
it was such a good idea myself.

01:31:04.210 --> 01:31:06.269
- Actually, it wasn't
even my idea. It was...
- Watch it!

01:31:06.345 --> 01:31:08.745
<i>I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Is the camera broke?</i>

01:31:08.815 --> 01:31:11.545
<i>Oh, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry. Did I ruin the take?</i>

01:31:11.617 --> 01:31:14.984
And thank you for findin' 'em, Flik.

01:31:15.054 --> 01:31:17.147
Me?

01:31:19.358 --> 01:31:22.225
- This really hurts, guys.
Can we cut? Ow!
- I'm sorry, I'm s...

01:31:23.796 --> 01:31:27.163
So, is there a Mrs. Ant
you have to tunnel home to?

01:31:27.233 --> 01:31:30.669
Oh, I'm sorry!
I thought he was real.

01:31:30.736 --> 01:31:34.400
Ooh, dear.
Put that thing in my car.

01:31:34.475 --> 01:31:36.500
Marker.

01:31:36.577 --> 01:31:38.977
Flik, after much deliberation...

01:31:42.583 --> 01:31:45.677
- Ohh, I... Ow. Oh. My eye!

01:31:45.752 --> 01:31:48.414
Oh. No, no. Seriously,
I've got berry juice in my eye!

01:31:48.489 --> 01:31:51.287
It stings! Stop acting. I'm serious.

01:31:51.358 --> 01:31:53.292
Oh, stop the camera!

01:31:55.762 --> 01:31:58.128
Uh-oh. Towel!
I need a towel over here!

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.134
<i>Cut!</i>

01:32:02.202 --> 01:32:05.501
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:32:05.572 --> 01:32:09.508
- Can we... Can we cut? It's just
I don't think I'm comin' across.

01:32:09.576 --> 01:32:12.875
Oh, oh, I know. I know.
I could lather up a bunch of spit.

01:32:12.946 --> 01:32:15.847
Ooh, ooh, that's good.
I got it,J.L. One more for me.

01:32:15.916 --> 01:32:17.884
<i>- Speed!
- Marker!</i>

01:32:17.951 --> 01:32:19.384
<i>Action!</i>

01:32:19.453 --> 01:32:22.217
Spinning a web of safety
in less than 50... Bleh!
