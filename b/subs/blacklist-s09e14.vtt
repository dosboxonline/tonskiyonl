WEBVTT

00:06.047 --> 00:09.467
We should've stayed
at that cute little B and B in town.

00:09.551 --> 00:11.261
It had great reviews online.

00:12.303 --> 00:14.806
Beds with mattresses.

00:14.889 --> 00:16.891
Where would the fun be in that?

00:17.684 --> 00:19.269
Where's the fun in this?

00:19.978 --> 00:22.355
It's creepy out here.
We're in the middle of nowhere.

00:22.439 --> 00:23.940
Come on.

00:24.023 --> 00:26.568
This was my family's spot
when I was little.

00:27.819 --> 00:30.530
Where they terrorized you
with campfire stories

00:30.613 --> 00:32.699
about the Whispering Woman.

00:33.700 --> 00:34.701
Yes.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.787
She haunted my childhood, it's true.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.457
Lucky for you...

00:40.957 --> 00:42.292
I'm no longer little.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.295
[branches breaking]

00:48.339 --> 00:49.174
What was that?

00:50.717 --> 00:51.801
How should I know?

00:51.885 --> 00:53.553
A squirrel, maybe?

00:53.636 --> 00:56.347
Or it's the Whispering Woman.

00:56.431 --> 00:57.265
Funny.

00:59.642 --> 01:00.727
[branches breaking]

01:03.229 --> 01:05.148
That was bigger than a squirrel.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.154
I think it's gone.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.657
Could you just check?

01:17.535 --> 01:18.369
Please?

01:23.374 --> 01:24.459
Oh!

01:39.974 --> 01:41.309
[screaming]

01:53.947 --> 01:55.698
That was Tadashi.

01:55.782 --> 02:00.411
He finished his dive
into Vandyke's laptop, as you requested.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.122
Did he discover any pearls,

02:02.205 --> 02:05.500
like who hired Vandyke
to assassinate Elizabeth?

02:05.583 --> 02:07.168
No.

02:07.252 --> 02:08.670
Did he at least confirm

02:08.753 --> 02:13.258
that Vandyke was in fact tracking
her on the night of her death?

02:13.341 --> 02:14.175
Yes.

02:15.343 --> 02:17.971
He was using an app
to monitor her location.

02:18.054 --> 02:20.140
But that is not all there is to it.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.809
I can feel a twist coming.

02:22.892 --> 02:24.144
According to the app,

02:24.227 --> 02:27.147
Tadashi believes the RF device
inside Elizabeth

02:27.230 --> 02:30.275
was designed to perform two functions.

02:30.358 --> 02:32.485
It transmits GPS coordinates

02:32.569 --> 02:35.822
and it monitors timed medication.

02:37.407 --> 02:40.034
I read the toxicology report.

02:40.743 --> 02:43.454
It found nothing unusual
in Elizabeth's system.

02:43.538 --> 02:44.455
She wasn't drugged.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.374
Maybe whoever slipped her the tracker

02:46.457 --> 02:48.751
didn't require full use
of its medical abilities.

02:48.835 --> 02:53.339
But as a medical device,
it was small enough for her to ingest.

02:53.423 --> 02:57.051
We're talking to the wrong people.
We don't need tech experts.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.929
We need medical ones.
We need to talk to Herbie.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.141
I already sent a courier to his home
with the tracker.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.184
He's not responding to my calls.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.270
You in some sort of disagreement?

03:07.353 --> 03:09.272
A disagreement with Herbie?

03:09.355 --> 03:12.859
The man likes conflict as much
as I like an overcooked egg.

03:12.942 --> 03:15.153
That's not like him to not answer.

03:15.236 --> 03:16.487
Try him again.

03:17.697 --> 03:18.740
[knocking on door]

03:22.660 --> 03:24.120
Senator, come in.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.497
Please, call me Cynthia.

03:26.581 --> 03:27.498
Cynthia.

03:28.875 --> 03:32.754
I'm afraid we're not fully equipped
for social calls here,

03:32.837 --> 03:36.174
but I couldn't refuse
your request to meet.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.218
Would you like a cup of coffee?

03:38.301 --> 03:40.220
This is difficult enough.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.472
Let's just cut to the gristle.

03:51.648 --> 03:52.941
I need your help.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.236
I suspected you might.

03:56.819 --> 04:00.156
I'd only come to you
if my situation were desperate.

04:00.657 --> 04:03.868
Been three weeks
since my daughter-in-law went missing.

04:03.952 --> 04:06.329
Yes, I've been following the news.

04:06.412 --> 04:07.538
I'm terribly sorry.

04:07.622 --> 04:10.750
The news you don't know,
because I'm keeping it from the press,

04:10.833 --> 04:14.212
is that Sheila resurfaced last night
at a campsite.

04:14.295 --> 04:18.007
No help from the local authorities,
mind you. She was half dead.

04:19.467 --> 04:20.718
Emaciated.

04:20.802 --> 04:21.970
Tortured.

04:23.137 --> 04:25.765
Now Sheila is in a medically induced coma,

04:25.848 --> 04:28.268
while whoever did this to her is still--

04:28.935 --> 04:30.144
Is still out there.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.981
Living and breathing.

04:33.856 --> 04:36.526
Enjoying the sun on their face,

04:36.609 --> 04:38.444
while Sheila's lying in a coma,

04:38.528 --> 04:39.362
and you're...

04:40.488 --> 04:42.198
feeling helpless.

04:43.032 --> 04:46.035
When nothing makes sense in the light,

04:46.828 --> 04:48.705
we have to search in the dark.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.919
I had a feeling you'd understand.

04:57.422 --> 05:00.508
Police interviewed the two campers
who Sheila found,

05:00.591 --> 05:03.011
but she collapsed without saying a word,

05:03.094 --> 05:05.179
so no idea where she came from.

05:05.263 --> 05:08.474
The woods where she surfaced
are 12,000 acres,

05:08.558 --> 05:11.060
a rural, mostly unincorporated area.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.979
It's a lot of ground to cover.

05:13.062 --> 05:15.940
Sheila's currently in a coma
at Chesapeake Bay Memorial

05:16.024 --> 05:17.025
fighting for her life.

05:17.108 --> 05:18.985
I have sympathy for Panabaker,

05:19.068 --> 05:21.654
but does an abduction case
in which the abduction is over

05:21.738 --> 05:23.281
merit this task force's attention?

05:23.364 --> 05:24.574
It does for me.

05:24.657 --> 05:28.328
I'm surprised the FBI isn't already on it
given Senator Panabaker's position.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.454
She asked for us.

05:29.537 --> 05:30.830
[Ressler] You mean Reddington.

05:30.913 --> 05:32.248
Where is he anyway?

05:32.332 --> 05:35.084
He has a lead on the tracking device
they found in Elizabeth.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.420
He assured me that he'll be available.

05:37.503 --> 05:41.466
Look, Cynthia's gone to bat
for this task force time and time again.

05:41.549 --> 05:42.550
We owe her this.

05:42.633 --> 05:45.678
Ressler, Aram, talk to Sheila's doctor.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.638
Does it have to be me?

05:47.722 --> 05:50.391
I mean, I kind of have things to do.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.602
-What things?
-[Aram] Oh.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.437
You know, computer things.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.481
It's all technical. Boring stuff.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.398
Of course.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.816
Park, go with Ressler.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.652
If we can find out from Sheila's doctor
what was done to her,

06:01.736 --> 06:03.988
it'll help us figure out who did it.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.497
I still don't understand
how Sheila got out.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.374
Maybe it's because we have
too many patients.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.085
And I'm spread too thin.

06:17.585 --> 06:20.713
-What if she leads the police to us?
-She won't.

06:21.380 --> 06:23.841
She left at night.
That had to have been disorienting.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.135
She walked for days.
Wound up 50 miles from here.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.012
I'm not concerned about her.

06:28.513 --> 06:31.933
But we now have an empty bed
that we need to fill.

06:33.392 --> 06:35.019
Lucky for us...

06:36.020 --> 06:37.897
I think I found a new prospect.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.485
I just said I can barely handle this.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.904
Not the right time
to bring in someone new.

06:44.987 --> 06:48.324
You know how important our mission is.

06:48.407 --> 06:50.326
We can always handle one more.

06:50.409 --> 06:52.662
We always make it work.

06:54.872 --> 06:58.376
She was hypothermic when she came in.
Dehydrated.

06:58.459 --> 06:59.585
Malnourished.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.088
I suppose being lost
in the woods for days in the cold

07:02.171 --> 07:04.006
with no food or water would do that.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.300
A lot of it but not the heart damage.

07:06.384 --> 07:07.635
She has heart damage?

07:07.718 --> 07:10.930
It's enlarged
with a reduced left ventricular function.

07:11.556 --> 07:15.101
But when I examined her further,
things got stranger.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.479
At first I thought
these were just knife wounds,

07:18.563 --> 07:19.772
torture maybe,

07:19.856 --> 07:22.525
but then we cleaned away the blood,

07:22.608 --> 07:24.277
we found this.

07:27.613 --> 07:28.698
Are those names?

07:28.781 --> 07:30.408
That'd be my guess.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.118
They appear self-inflicted.

07:32.201 --> 07:34.704
Why would she carve names
into her own leg?

07:36.873 --> 07:37.957
Mom?

07:38.040 --> 07:39.834
Remember what we talked about.

07:40.334 --> 07:42.420
She can't hear you right now.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.255
She's really sick, Char.

07:45.506 --> 07:46.716
You'll have to excuse us.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.801
This is the first time
she's seen her since--

07:48.885 --> 07:50.595
Please. We were heading out.

07:54.807 --> 07:57.143
Let's go find the bastard who did this.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.066
[man on TV]<i> Just a little bit, all right?</i>

08:04.692 --> 08:06.903
<i>Try to swish it around.</i>

08:06.986 --> 08:08.196
<i>Just one thin layer.</i>

08:08.279 --> 08:11.324
Honey, do you want mustard
or mayo on your sandwich?

08:11.407 --> 08:12.742
[alarm beeping]

08:14.202 --> 08:15.244
Sarah?

08:20.541 --> 08:22.460
Bill! She's seizing!

08:36.807 --> 08:38.100
We spoke with her doctor

08:38.184 --> 08:40.603
and it seems your daughter-in-law
carved the names

08:40.686 --> 08:42.605
of two women into her own thigh.

08:43.397 --> 08:44.732
Sheila did that?

08:45.691 --> 08:47.443
For God's sake, why?

08:47.944 --> 08:49.070
This is conjecture,

08:49.153 --> 08:50.905
but we believe she knew she might die

08:50.988 --> 08:53.241
and wanted to send a message
to whoever found her.

08:53.324 --> 08:56.285
To let them know
there are other victims out there.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.038
The message worked. We ID'd the names.

08:59.121 --> 09:02.166
Uh, Crystal Flowers and Maria Holmes.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.585
While both names are incredibly common,

09:04.669 --> 09:06.337
I was able to narrow down the search

09:06.420 --> 09:08.339
because of a peculiar connection
to Sheila.

09:08.422 --> 09:11.133
I know those women.
Where do I know them from?

09:11.217 --> 09:13.719
Aram conducted a social media search

09:13.803 --> 09:15.972
and saw all three mothers

09:16.055 --> 09:18.766
were featured
on the Tiny Fighters Foundation website.

09:18.849 --> 09:21.477
I remember the interview. I was there.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.146
That's a fundraising organization.

09:24.230 --> 09:27.567
They share stories of children
facing health issues.

09:27.650 --> 09:30.194
I've donated a lot to Tiny Fighters.

09:30.278 --> 09:31.862
How has no one made the connection

09:31.946 --> 09:33.948
these mothers
were going missing until now?

09:34.031 --> 09:38.077
Well, over 600,000 people
go missing in the U.S. every year.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.830
These cases are spread out
over several years,

09:40.913 --> 09:44.125
in different parts of the country,
and under different circumstances.

09:44.208 --> 09:47.420
We're bringing in the woman
who runs Tiny Fighters, Emily Wright.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.338
We'll see if she has something to offer.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.256
Okay.

09:51.382 --> 09:54.427
Thank you for the briefing.
And for your work.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.807
Remember the new prospect
that I told you about?

09:59.890 --> 10:02.435
I've been studying her medical records.

10:02.518 --> 10:04.478
She's got a long and complicated history

10:04.562 --> 10:07.440
that I think is a perfect match
for our hospital.

10:07.523 --> 10:09.734
So I'm gonna make my move tonight.

10:09.817 --> 10:12.278
By morning, we will have a new patient.

10:12.361 --> 10:14.280
See to it that her bed is ready.

10:15.531 --> 10:17.742
Yes, ma'am.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.037
[Emily]<i> I don't understand.</i>

10:21.120 --> 10:23.873
Who would wanna hurt mothers,
especially our mothers?

10:23.956 --> 10:27.293
They're the most loving, selfless people
I've ever known.

10:27.376 --> 10:29.962
Who in your organization has access
to your database?

10:30.046 --> 10:31.881
We have hundreds of volunteers.

10:31.964 --> 10:36.052
They all have access. I can get you a log
of their names and e-mails.

10:36.135 --> 10:40.056
What were the dates the kids
of these mothers were profiled?

10:43.309 --> 10:46.812
October 3rd, 2020, Crystal's son.

10:46.896 --> 10:50.149
February 10th of last year, Maria's son.

10:50.232 --> 10:53.944
And January 25th of this year,
Sheila's daughter.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.071
Why?

10:57.573 --> 11:00.701
All the women were abducted
within a week of their children's profile.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.787
Somebody's trolling
your website for victims.

11:02.870 --> 11:05.581
-This can't be happening.
-Who did you profile this week?

11:06.540 --> 11:08.459
Don't you think this is a bit extreme?

11:08.542 --> 11:10.252
He's not answering our calls.

11:10.336 --> 11:14.757
You don't just go silent, not on me,
or I'm gonna find out the reason why.

11:16.592 --> 11:17.426
Herbie?

11:19.512 --> 11:20.429
Herbie!

11:21.597 --> 11:24.558
We saw your Vanagon in the garage, Herbie.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.352
I know you're there.

11:26.435 --> 11:27.686
[baby crying]

11:29.105 --> 11:31.315
It's been 36 hours. Give me a second.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.571
My wife's on a digital detox retreat
and I can't get a hold of her.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.616
I can't do this, man.
I'm not meant to be a father.

11:40.699 --> 11:42.827
I think I'm actually losing my mind.

11:42.910 --> 11:44.328
My baby hates me.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.455
Like, she actually hates me.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.832
No, no, no.

11:47.915 --> 11:50.209
-What's her name?
-Sue.

11:50.292 --> 11:51.210
As in "A Boy Named."

11:51.293 --> 11:53.879
Why wife's a Johnny Cash fan. Never mind.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.173
-Come here.
-All right.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.800
Come here. Yes.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.802
Come here.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.470
There you go.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.930
Yeah.

12:03.013 --> 12:04.014
[Raymond chuckles]

12:05.099 --> 12:06.767
They're pretty reliable.

12:07.726 --> 12:10.521
Only a few things cause them strife.

12:11.230 --> 12:14.859
Hunger, fatigue, gas.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.068
[Raymond chuckles]

12:17.486 --> 12:20.656
All they need is close attention and love.

12:20.739 --> 12:26.620
And it's wonderful to be able to instantly
give them everything they want.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.498
-[coos]
-Yeah.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.835
Cherish this time.

12:33.794 --> 12:35.171
Simplicity.

12:37.798 --> 12:40.509
Because it gets pretty complicated,
I'm afraid.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.427
Yeah.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.180
It's okay.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.265
-It's okay.
-No, no, no.

12:46.348 --> 12:48.058
-It's okay.
-Yeah.

12:48.642 --> 12:51.437
Oh, my God. She senses your fear.

12:52.646 --> 12:55.983
Dear God, Herbie. You must relax.

12:56.484 --> 12:57.735
Here.

13:02.781 --> 13:03.616
Hi.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.748

13:30.267 --> 13:33.103
Can you please stay for a while?

13:33.604 --> 13:34.772
I'm desperate.

13:37.566 --> 13:41.070
That depends on what you can
tell me about my tracker.

13:44.573 --> 13:45.908
We reached out to the mothers

13:45.991 --> 13:48.536
whose children were just profiled.
We got ahold of three.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.162
They're aware of the circumstances

13:50.246 --> 13:52.540
and are looking out for anything
or anyone unusual.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.209
-The fourth?
-Mary Sutton. We couldn't reach her.

13:55.292 --> 13:58.420
But I tracked down her husband
who said Mary and their daughter Sarah

13:58.504 --> 14:01.173
are at George Washington
Children's Hospital.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.550
Sarah had a seizure.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.843
Ressler, Dembe, head to the hospital.

14:04.927 --> 14:08.013
Confirm that Mary's safe.
Brief her on the situation.

14:09.139 --> 14:11.433
Your daughter is a lovely girl.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.936
I know it's no fun being in the hospital,

14:14.019 --> 14:16.522
but I'd like to keep her for a few days.

14:16.605 --> 14:19.817
Usually we only stay the night
when she has one of her seizures.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.278
The sodium levels in her blood
are unusually high.

14:22.361 --> 14:26.031
I'd like to get her on an IV
to rebalance that concentration.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.242
Has she been vomiting or having diarrhea?

14:28.325 --> 14:31.245
She could be dehydrated
or suffering from hypernatremia.

14:31.328 --> 14:34.957
She's on a very strict diet.
Wouldn't account for any of that.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.501
Plus, I care for her day in and day out.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.461
I know her better than anybody.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.506
Maybe you wanna rerun the tests?

14:44.633 --> 14:45.885
Mother knows best.

14:45.968 --> 14:48.178
I'll see what I can do. I'll be back.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.065
Are you the night nurse?

15:01.650 --> 15:05.654
Yeah. I just wanted to drop off
the wheelchair for Sarah's release.

15:05.738 --> 15:09.283
-Assuming she'll be discharged tomorrow?
-I was trying to tell the doctor that.

15:09.366 --> 15:10.618
Thank you!

15:10.701 --> 15:13.662
They keep trying to hold her
for days and days.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.081
It's such an insurance scam.

15:16.165 --> 15:16.999
Yeah.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.297
-I know the truth.
-[gasps]

15:24.798 --> 15:27.551
Excuse me. Agents Ressler and Zuma, FBI.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.511
We're looking for Sarah Sutton's room.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.430
[grunting]

15:38.145 --> 15:39.271
What are you doing?

15:39.355 --> 15:41.398
I'm doing you a favor. Trust me.

15:41.482 --> 15:42.691
Somebody, help!

15:42.775 --> 15:44.443
Please help! Please!

15:47.404 --> 15:49.740
Room's gotta be up here on the right.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.915
The nurse, she hurt my mom.

15:57.998 --> 15:59.041
Where is she?

15:59.124 --> 16:01.001
She left with the wheelchair.

16:16.058 --> 16:18.644
She was medium-build,

16:18.727 --> 16:20.020
white.

16:20.104 --> 16:22.314
It happened so fast.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.441
She dosed you
with a pretty powerful sedative.

16:24.525 --> 16:25.901
Why?

16:25.985 --> 16:26.860
Why me?

16:26.944 --> 16:28.237
[Dembe] We don't know yet.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.114
Only that you fit a pattern.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.407
Pattern?

16:32.282 --> 16:33.701
What pattern?

16:33.784 --> 16:36.286
My entire life is devoted
to taking care of my daughter.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.706
I barely have time to brush my teeth.

16:38.789 --> 16:41.083
-We'll get to the bottom of this.
-Until then?

16:41.166 --> 16:43.168
We stay where someone attacked us?

16:43.252 --> 16:46.588
We've assigned an agent.
He'll be outside your room 24/7.

16:46.672 --> 16:47.923
You're in good hands.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.969
I couldn't ID the woman posing as a nurse.
The footage was too grainy.

16:52.052 --> 16:53.387
The injection gun?

16:53.470 --> 16:55.973
She was wearing gloves,
so no prints to trace.

16:56.056 --> 16:57.850
But I did research the device.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.935
And it is actually pretty nifty.

17:00.019 --> 17:03.689
I mean, if it wasn't being used
to kidnap young mothers.

17:03.772 --> 17:05.441
<i>Instead of a needle,</i>

17:05.524 --> 17:08.736
compressed air shoots
a thin stream of medication

17:08.819 --> 17:11.155
directly into underlying tissue layers.

17:11.238 --> 17:13.323
The challenge is, I can't trace it.

17:13.407 --> 17:16.243
It's not legal and seems to be
a much more powerful version

17:16.326 --> 17:19.288
-of what's on the current market.
<i>-That means it's black market.</i>

17:19.371 --> 17:20.456
Call Raymond.

17:20.539 --> 17:24.293
He's connected to the best underground
medical resources money can buy.

17:24.376 --> 17:27.755
I think it was designed
to administer and monitor medication.

17:27.838 --> 17:30.841
Some conditions require drugs
to be taken on very strict schedules,

17:30.924 --> 17:31.759
exact dosages.

17:31.842 --> 17:35.137
Patients with those disorders aren't
always reliable in taking meds.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.347
-How does it work?
-[Herbie] It has a capsule.

17:37.431 --> 17:40.267
If I'm right,
it's pre-loaded with medication.

17:40.350 --> 17:41.518
At least one dose.

17:41.602 --> 17:44.396
Then sends wireless data
to the patient's doctor

17:44.480 --> 17:47.357
to track that the meds were taken
and the patient's whereabouts.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.401
Who uses this technology?

17:49.985 --> 17:52.321
As far as I know, no one yet.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.448
It's a cutting-edge technology.

17:55.949 --> 17:59.620
I did hear a medical clinic in Boston
was considering a pilot program.

17:59.703 --> 18:01.955
-I need the name of that clinic.
-Okay.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.083
[cell phone ringing]

18:08.420 --> 18:09.254
[Raymond] Harold.

18:09.338 --> 18:10.464
I'm texting you a photo.

18:10.547 --> 18:12.466
The woman who abducted
Panabaker's daughter

18:12.549 --> 18:15.385
dropped a medical device
when she went after her latest victim.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.596
<i>It's not legal.</i>
<i>We have no way to track it.</i>

18:17.679 --> 18:20.057
I think with a little hard work
and elbow grease,

18:20.140 --> 18:22.893
I can find someone
who can take care of that.

18:22.976 --> 18:24.061
I'll be in touch.

18:25.521 --> 18:29.316
I hate to pile on,
but something else has come up.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.611
Do you think you can help me

18:32.694 --> 18:34.947
to identify and trace that?

18:35.697 --> 18:36.698
If you keep her happy,

18:36.782 --> 18:39.576
there is literally nothing
I won't do for you.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.496
[Maria whimpering]

18:43.413 --> 18:44.665
[Eva] You poor, poor thing.

18:44.748 --> 18:47.835
The pain must be unbearable.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.838
Please, let me go.

18:50.921 --> 18:51.964
Please.

18:52.047 --> 18:55.968
Can't take on another. Not after
what happened at the hospital.

18:56.051 --> 18:57.886
No one got a good look. I was careful.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.764
You're not careful. You're out of control.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.016
You need to slow things down.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.602
Would Chelsea want us to slow things down?

19:06.478 --> 19:09.189
You always have to bring her up.

19:09.273 --> 19:10.524
Yes, I do.

19:10.607 --> 19:13.485
Because she is why we do what we do.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.158
Yeah.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.742
The infection has spread.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.245
Why are you doing this to me?

19:24.288 --> 19:27.249
It is because you're an incredible mother

19:27.332 --> 19:31.170
who would do anything
to eliminate her son's pain.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.338
That's what you told Tiny Fighters.

19:33.422 --> 19:37.843
And now we are giving you a chance
to make good on your word.

19:37.926 --> 19:39.511
Your boy's getting better

19:39.595 --> 19:41.930
because you're taking his sickness
into your body.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.725
We need to do something
to stop this from spreading further.

19:44.808 --> 19:48.228
-Or she's gonna lose the leg.
-Then take me to a hospital.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.271
A real one!

19:49.354 --> 19:52.900
No, we can handle everything right here.

19:53.901 --> 19:55.611
Do we know who his sponsor is?

19:56.612 --> 19:59.323
Wait. What're you talking about?
My sponsor?

19:59.406 --> 20:01.283
It's Narcotics Anonymous for a reason.

20:01.366 --> 20:02.409
[Park] What? No, no.

20:02.492 --> 20:04.453
We're just trying
to remember who sponsors--

20:04.536 --> 20:05.454
LeBron James.

20:05.537 --> 20:08.874
I saw him in some new kicks
at a game the other night.

20:08.957 --> 20:10.918
Trying to track down a pair.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.920
Kicks, yeah? What game was that?

20:13.003 --> 20:14.671
I don't think I saw it.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.173
[Cooper] Reddington called back.

20:16.256 --> 20:19.801
His contact ID'd
the manufacturer of the drug injector.

20:19.885 --> 20:23.388
A set of them were delivered
to an address in West Virginia,

20:23.472 --> 20:26.016
along with medical beds and equipment.

20:26.099 --> 20:27.643
I need a team there, fast.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.816
[Dembe] Should we announce?

20:34.900 --> 20:36.985
No. This place looks deserted.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.488
If there's someone here,
we don't wanna tip them off.

20:39.988 --> 20:42.324
Think Reddington got the wrong address?

20:51.792 --> 20:52.709
[whispering] Dembe.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.507
Help. Help me.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.133
Help me. Help.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.885
Help me. Help.

21:16.316 --> 21:17.401
[groaning]

21:21.405 --> 21:22.489
Ressler!

21:22.572 --> 21:25.158
-Drop it.
-No. No!

21:36.920 --> 21:39.715
So that's the woman
who's responsible for this?

21:39.798 --> 21:40.674
One of them.

21:41.425 --> 21:44.136
She didn't act alone.
There's another woman out there,

21:44.219 --> 21:46.805
the one who tried to abduct
Mary Sutton from the hospital.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.558
How are the other victims doing?

21:49.641 --> 21:52.769
They're all in serious condition.
One critical.

21:53.353 --> 21:56.732
We also found remains on the property.

21:58.233 --> 22:00.485
The victims we've ID'd
all have the same profile,

22:00.569 --> 22:04.364
all were abducted while caring
for very sick children, just like Sheila.

22:04.448 --> 22:07.367
What we didn't know until now
is that while they were being held,

22:07.451 --> 22:10.787
they were inflicted
with various medical treatments

22:10.871 --> 22:14.207
to make them mirror
the symptoms of their sick children.

22:14.291 --> 22:17.169
Which explains why
your daughter-in-law and granddaughter

22:17.252 --> 22:19.296
both presented signs of cardiomyopathy.

22:19.379 --> 22:22.632
Why? Why make these women
relive that terror?

22:22.716 --> 22:25.260
Why inflict on them
the pain they witnessed?

22:25.343 --> 22:27.554
I don't have a conclusive answer yet.

22:28.055 --> 22:30.182
But there's light
at the end of the tunnel.

22:30.265 --> 22:32.434
As soon they're released
from the hospital,

22:32.517 --> 22:34.603
they'll be reunited with their children.

22:34.686 --> 22:37.898
I hope Sheila gets
that opportunity with Charlotte.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.026
We're getting nowhere with her.

22:41.109 --> 22:44.654
We've had her in that box for hours,
now she's asking for an attorney.

22:44.738 --> 22:47.407
No. Absolutely not.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.826
This is our one chance with this woman.

22:49.910 --> 22:52.037
Cynthia, we can't deny her counsel.

22:53.622 --> 22:57.042
Perhaps, we're not the ones
who should be questioning her.

23:01.129 --> 23:02.923
[Binstock shouting in distance]

23:08.595 --> 23:10.180
You seem ill at ease.

23:10.972 --> 23:12.307
Yes, well...

23:14.184 --> 23:17.604
there is a line I have avoided
crossing in my career.

23:17.687 --> 23:18.563
Until now.

23:19.940 --> 23:23.819
I find myself thinking more
and more about that line lately.

23:24.444 --> 23:28.782
You're looking for someone
who has hurt those dearest to you.

23:29.574 --> 23:33.912
And the prism
through which you see the world...

23:35.080 --> 23:36.832
has completely changed.

23:41.336 --> 23:44.881
And maybe that line doesn't exist anymore.

23:47.050 --> 23:50.595
Have you made any progress
tracking down Agent Keen's killer?

23:50.679 --> 23:52.556
Actually, yes, I have a lead.

23:52.639 --> 23:54.307
But you're here with me.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.476
Well, it's not out of selflessness.

23:57.310 --> 23:59.729
I'm taking a reflective pause.

24:04.526 --> 24:08.405
I'm considering the extent of
what I might do to get to the truth.

24:11.324 --> 24:14.077
Yes, well, I know what you mean.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.748
Look where devotion
has brought both of us.

24:19.249 --> 24:21.918
My daughter-in-law, your Elizabeth.

24:23.545 --> 24:25.505
If you're willing to go this far,

24:25.589 --> 24:28.633
imagine how far
someone like me is willing to go.

24:31.261 --> 24:33.013
I got what you needed, boss.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.765
Lucy and Ethel never fail me.

24:36.683 --> 24:39.060
But she won't like what I've got to say.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.813
There is nothing
that could make this worse.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.815
Just rip the bandage off, Teddy.

24:45.150 --> 24:48.069
Your daughter-in-law, Sheila, right?

24:49.196 --> 24:50.322
She ain't the victim.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.324
What are you talking about?

24:54.492 --> 24:58.455
She's been slipping your granddaughter
a nasty concoction for years,

24:59.372 --> 25:02.459
making the little girl sick
and keeping her that way.

25:03.627 --> 25:06.379
Munchausen, that's what they call it.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.799
That is the most absurd thing I've heard.

25:09.883 --> 25:12.427
I told you she wasn't gonna like
what I had to say.

25:14.304 --> 25:17.098
That's a lie.
Sheila would never hurt her child.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.892
Charlotte is her entire life.

25:20.685 --> 25:23.438
-I wanna talk to that nurse.
-Wait, Cynthia.

25:23.521 --> 25:25.649
Hold on, please. Let's talk.

25:25.732 --> 25:26.983
I want the truth.

25:27.067 --> 25:30.237
And you may very well have it,
I promise you.

25:31.112 --> 25:34.491
What do you know
about your granddaughter's illness?

25:34.574 --> 25:37.661
It was a very complicated diagnosis.

25:37.744 --> 25:39.454
Why am I even answering that?

25:40.247 --> 25:42.874
This is ridiculous. Charlotte is sick.

25:43.583 --> 25:46.127
Senator, I urge you
to think with your head,

25:46.211 --> 25:47.671
and not with your heart.

25:49.047 --> 25:52.550
Has there never been a moment of doubt?

25:52.634 --> 25:54.010
A red flag?

25:56.388 --> 26:00.392
Months ago, I wanted Charlotte
to see a cardiologist at Walter Reed.

26:01.268 --> 26:04.646
Takes months to get an appointment.
I used my position to get on his books.

26:04.729 --> 26:08.650
My son was thrilled,
but Sheila insisted that a care plan

26:08.733 --> 26:10.860
was already in place.

26:10.944 --> 26:13.238
I pushed and pushed. Finally, she agreed.

26:13.321 --> 26:15.365
The day of the appointment,
they never showed.

26:15.991 --> 26:18.326
Charlotte was having so many issues,

26:18.410 --> 26:21.204
and Sheila seemed so stressed,
I didn't think that...

26:22.747 --> 26:23.999
That was one incident.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.251
-That can't possibly mean--
-[cell phone pings]

26:28.795 --> 26:30.630
It's a text from my son.

26:30.714 --> 26:32.465
Sheila's off the respirator.

26:34.592 --> 26:36.720
-What should I do?
-Stay calm.

26:37.804 --> 26:39.681
Obtain the facts you need.

26:40.223 --> 26:43.226
Your greatest resource
is right through that door.

26:47.689 --> 26:48.773
[Aram] <i>Reddington called.</i>

26:48.857 --> 26:51.818
It turns out, we have
this whole thing backwards.

26:51.901 --> 26:53.111
What does that mean?

26:53.194 --> 26:55.530
They got that nurse, Binstock, to talk.

26:55.613 --> 26:58.742
She insists she was never in the business
of hurting innocent mothers,

26:58.825 --> 27:01.536
because those mothers were never innocent.

27:01.619 --> 27:03.246
So, what is she guilty of?

27:03.330 --> 27:07.625
Their children weren't really sick.
The mothers were making them sick.

27:07.709 --> 27:11.755
She was hurting the mothers as punishment
for what they did to their own kids.

27:11.838 --> 27:15.300
And the longer she kept them,
the healthier their children became.

27:15.383 --> 27:17.594
I've read about it. Munchausen's.

27:17.677 --> 27:21.056
Yeah, it's actually
Munchausen's by proxy to be exact.

27:21.139 --> 27:23.808
It's a mental illness
and form of child abuse.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.935
Sir, can you please help me?

27:26.019 --> 27:28.813
My daughter had an accident.
I need some towels.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.482
-[Sarah] What for?
-Let me page the nurse.

27:30.565 --> 27:31.983
It's not working.

27:32.067 --> 27:34.152
-Can you just please get us a few towels?
-Mom.

27:34.235 --> 27:36.613
-Please?
-Okay, okay. Give me a minute.

27:36.696 --> 27:37.614
Thank you.

27:37.697 --> 27:40.492
The darkness in this world
still manages to surprise me.

27:40.575 --> 27:43.453
Let me remind everyone,
this nurse is a murderer.

27:43.536 --> 27:45.914
She came at Dembe and I with a scalpel.

27:45.997 --> 27:48.708
-Can we trust anything she says?
-No, we can't.

27:48.792 --> 27:52.295
But children's lives may be at risk,
so we need to act fast.

27:52.379 --> 27:55.632
Park, look into medical records
of the children of the abductees.

27:55.715 --> 27:58.718
Aram, reach out to the agents
with the mothers being examined.

27:58.802 --> 28:01.221
Have them stall reunification
with their children.

28:01.304 --> 28:03.390
Dembe, Ressler, go to the hospital,

28:03.473 --> 28:06.309
and separate Mary Sutton
from her daughter until we learn more.

28:06.393 --> 28:07.227
[cell phone rings]

28:08.186 --> 28:09.229
Agent Herndon.

28:09.312 --> 28:12.440
We have reason to believe Mary Sutton
may be a danger to her daughter.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.025
<i>Can you verify their whereabouts?</i>

28:15.318 --> 28:16.152
I can't.

28:16.236 --> 28:17.570
What do you mean?

28:18.571 --> 28:19.614
They're gone.

28:22.867 --> 28:25.662
I don't believe it.
I don't believe any of it.

28:25.745 --> 28:28.915
We don't need you to believe, Mr. Sutton,
but we do need your help.

28:28.998 --> 28:32.210
Your wife slipped FBI
protective custody 30 minutes ago

28:32.293 --> 28:34.212
and fled the hospital with your daughter.

28:34.295 --> 28:37.048
You don't know what you're talking about.
You weren't there.

28:37.132 --> 28:38.925
All the nights Mary sat up with Sarah,

28:39.008 --> 28:42.053
all the dirty sheets, the midnight trips
to the emergency room.

28:42.137 --> 28:44.222
When was the last time
you spoke to your wife?

28:44.305 --> 28:46.808
Earlier today.
She said she'd call when I get off work.

28:46.891 --> 28:48.017
When was that?

28:51.146 --> 28:54.232
Hour and a half. It doesn't mean anything.

28:55.358 --> 28:56.735
Do you have another residence?

28:56.818 --> 28:58.945
Somewhere your wife
might take your daughter?

28:59.028 --> 29:01.698
Another residence? With our medical bills?

29:01.781 --> 29:04.826
I had to find a second job
just to get us by.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.246
I take care of the money, Mary takes...

29:12.542 --> 29:15.253
Mary is the most selfless mother
in the world.

29:15.336 --> 29:16.296
She is.

29:16.921 --> 29:18.381
[Ressler] Don't beat yourself up.

29:18.465 --> 29:23.052
Based on what we're learning, your wife's
been deceiving the medical community.

29:23.136 --> 29:25.388
Teachers, friends, foundations.

29:26.014 --> 29:27.807
Do you mind if we borrow this?

29:29.851 --> 29:31.269
Take whatever you want.

29:32.729 --> 29:34.397
Just bring my daughter home.

29:35.857 --> 29:38.610
And my wife.
I know there's an explanation.

29:43.323 --> 29:44.741
Ooh.

29:44.824 --> 29:46.409
Look at this place.

29:47.076 --> 29:48.495
What are we doing here?

29:48.578 --> 29:51.164
I thought maybe we'd get
some of those cinnamon rolls

29:51.247 --> 29:53.041
you love so much from here.

29:53.124 --> 29:54.459
We're not at the hospital.

29:54.542 --> 29:57.462
The doctor said I need
to finish my infusion or...

29:57.879 --> 29:59.255
The doctor's an idiot.

30:01.841 --> 30:03.259
You're acting weird.

30:04.260 --> 30:06.221
Why haven't you called Dad yet?
He'll worry.

30:06.304 --> 30:07.555
Oh, you lay back.

30:07.639 --> 30:10.475
I brought some of
your medication from home.

30:10.558 --> 30:12.060
It will help you rest.

30:12.143 --> 30:13.686
Then you'll call Dad?

30:14.938 --> 30:16.648
Of course, I will.

30:17.524 --> 30:18.775
There we go.

30:26.533 --> 30:27.534
Mom.

30:28.159 --> 30:29.285
Can you believe it?

30:29.828 --> 30:31.579
It's a miracle.

30:35.375 --> 30:36.209
Are you okay?

30:37.752 --> 30:40.964
I'm just... overwhelmed.

30:41.047 --> 30:43.925
I know. I feel the same way.

30:49.806 --> 30:52.433
Bill Sutton has no idea
where his wife and daughter are.

30:52.517 --> 30:53.977
Where are we on medical records?

30:54.060 --> 30:56.729
We don't have them yet.
We're waiting on DOJ authorization.

30:56.813 --> 30:59.190
Uh, maybe we don't have to wait.

30:59.274 --> 31:02.819
This is all evidence collected
from that abandoned hospital

31:02.902 --> 31:07.365
where Ressler and Dembe apprehended
their nurse friend with the scalpel.

31:07.448 --> 31:12.704
Turns out, Binstock and our Blacklister
kept almost immaculate records

31:12.787 --> 31:15.540
of the families they surveilled.

31:16.040 --> 31:20.295
All of the children here have confusing
and extensive medical records,

31:20.378 --> 31:25.508
a clear indication
of Munchausen's by proxy.

31:25.592 --> 31:28.136
I can't keep track of the bad guy anymore.

31:28.219 --> 31:31.180
We're trying to find an assailant
who is harming Mary Sutton,

31:31.264 --> 31:34.642
but Mary Sutton is doing
irreparable harm to her daughter.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.144
Who am I slapping the cuffs on?

31:36.227 --> 31:39.147
How about we slap the cuffs
on everyone until that girl is safe?

31:39.230 --> 31:40.148
Ask questions later.

31:40.231 --> 31:42.358
We're dealing with two criminals:

31:42.442 --> 31:44.694
Mary Sutton and the woman
who tried to abduct her.

31:44.777 --> 31:46.613
[Aram] I did some digging on Binstock.

31:46.696 --> 31:51.242
She worked as a home healthcare nurse
for a young girl named Chelsea Mason,

31:51.326 --> 31:53.828
who had a rare GI disorder.

31:53.912 --> 31:57.165
After Chelsea died,
Binstock left the nursing field

31:57.248 --> 32:02.211
and Eva Mason, Chelsea's older sister,
received a fortune in settlements,

32:02.295 --> 32:05.381
all from hospitals that
performed needless procedures

32:05.465 --> 32:07.300
that only worsened Chelsea's condition.

32:07.383 --> 32:11.596
Turns out, Chelsea wasn't really sick.
Her mother was poisoning her.

32:11.679 --> 32:15.016
So we think this sister, Eva,
has a personal vendetta

32:15.099 --> 32:16.935
against mothers who hurt their children

32:17.018 --> 32:19.812
and she's the co-conspirator
who tried to abduct Mary Sutton?

32:19.896 --> 32:21.856
Binstock and Eva do share a past.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.775
[Park] How do they ID the mothers?

32:23.858 --> 32:27.528
Well, Eva volunteers
for the Tiny Fighters Foundation,

32:27.612 --> 32:31.908
where she films interviews,
looking for signs of Munchausen.

32:31.991 --> 32:33.993
If a mother fits the profile,

32:34.077 --> 32:37.997
then Binstock, who works part time
as an insurance claims adjustor,

32:38.081 --> 32:41.167
confirms she's correct
via medical records that don't add up.

32:41.250 --> 32:42.752
How do we find Eva Mason?

32:42.835 --> 32:44.796
If she's out there,
she's after the Suttons.

32:44.879 --> 32:47.215
I did run a search,
and got a hit on her credit card

32:47.298 --> 32:50.677
being used in Delaware a few hours ago,
but she could be anywhere by now.

32:50.760 --> 32:54.305
If she's a videographer for Tiny Fighters,
I might know where they are.

32:54.389 --> 32:55.890
I was just watching this.

32:59.519 --> 33:02.063
[Eva] <i>What do you do to cope</i>
<i>when things get hard?</i>

33:02.146 --> 33:06.651
<i>-Gosh. I don't know.</i>
<i>-So many things. Disney.</i>

33:06.734 --> 33:10.822
<i>And Sarah has a group of friends</i>
<i>who did a dance-a-thon fundraiser.</i>

33:10.905 --> 33:14.200
<i>And we really like</i>
<i>our mother-daughter spa trips.</i>

33:14.826 --> 33:16.035
[Eva] <i>Where do you go?</i>

33:16.119 --> 33:20.164
<i>We go to a place in Delaware</i>
<i>called Primrose Grand Hotel...</i>

33:20.248 --> 33:22.375
You said Eva Mason's in Delaware?

33:22.458 --> 33:24.252
That can't be a coincidence.

33:24.335 --> 33:28.381
Verify the Suttons are at that hotel,
and get there before Eva does.

33:30.842 --> 33:33.511
-I'll get some ice. I'll be right back.
-Okay.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.658
[door opens, then closes]

33:59.454 --> 34:01.205
-What are you doing here?
-Sweetheart--

34:01.289 --> 34:04.250
-Where's my mom?
-You need medical attention.

34:04.333 --> 34:06.335
How could you know? You're not a doctor.

34:06.419 --> 34:08.921
No. I'm more than a doctor.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.758
I am a miracle worker.

34:11.841 --> 34:14.260
And I am going to cure you.

34:14.343 --> 34:15.303
Hey!

34:15.386 --> 34:17.138
Get away from my daughter.

34:21.851 --> 34:24.103
It's you. You tried to attack me.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.439
I did that to protect
your daughter, and I failed.

34:26.522 --> 34:27.982
But I won't fail twice.

34:28.066 --> 34:31.235
This is so much quicker than you deserve,

34:31.319 --> 34:33.279
but I will use it on you.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.490
-Unless...
-Unless what?

34:36.115 --> 34:37.825
I call an ambulance,

34:37.909 --> 34:41.370
Sarah goes to the hospital
for treatment, you come with me.

34:41.454 --> 34:43.664
She doesn't need a hospital.
She needs her mother.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.166
Stop it, both of you!

34:45.249 --> 34:47.627
-Sarah!
-[Eva] Sarah, before you do anything,

34:47.710 --> 34:48.669
let me explain.

34:48.753 --> 34:51.672
-Put that gun down.
-Sweetie, listen to me.

34:51.756 --> 34:53.633
-FBI, lower your weapons!
-Sarah!

34:54.217 --> 34:56.427
-What's going on?
-Put your guns down.

34:56.511 --> 34:59.472
This woman is crazy.
She tried to attack me.

34:59.555 --> 35:03.226
Sarah, your mom is making you sick.
She gives you, what, pills?

35:03.309 --> 35:06.270
-How do you feel when you take them?
-You're lying.

35:06.354 --> 35:07.855
[Mary] Sarah, listen to me.

35:07.939 --> 35:10.191
Look at me. This woman is insane.

35:10.274 --> 35:13.903
I would never try to hurt you.
I love you more than anyone.

35:14.570 --> 35:16.155
Is my mom making me sick?

35:16.239 --> 35:18.825
Please, put the weapons down.
Nobody needs to get hurt.

35:18.908 --> 35:21.285
This woman is a child abuser.

35:21.369 --> 35:23.412
[Dembe] And she will be punished for that.

35:23.496 --> 35:24.622
Like my mother was?

35:24.705 --> 35:26.541
We know about your sister.

35:28.084 --> 35:29.669
No, you don't know.

35:30.169 --> 35:33.464
You did not watch my mother
drain the life out of her,

35:33.548 --> 35:35.258
confine her to one room.

35:35.341 --> 35:37.301
Her only friends were dolls.

35:38.219 --> 35:41.931
I knew what she was doing,
and nobody listened to me.

35:42.014 --> 35:45.309
The system is failing these children.

35:45.393 --> 35:48.813
And they don't have time to waste.
Their lives are at stake.

35:49.480 --> 35:50.523
-[shouts]
-I'm sorry.

35:50.606 --> 35:51.858
Sarah!

35:53.067 --> 35:55.570
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35:55.653 --> 35:56.612
Do not move.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.489
-I'm sorry.
-Are you okay?

35:58.573 --> 36:01.159
She's my daughter! What is wrong with you?

36:09.959 --> 36:11.043
[cell phone ringing]

36:12.628 --> 36:14.297
Senator Panabaker.

36:14.380 --> 36:16.424
[Panabaker] <i>I'm calling to thank you.</i>

36:16.507 --> 36:20.136
I asked you to help me find the truth.
You did exactly that.

36:20.761 --> 36:23.014
How is your family handling things?

36:23.639 --> 36:25.141
My son is devastated.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.935
I took my granddaughter out
for the afternoon.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.438
I didn't want her to be there
when the arrest happens.

36:30.521 --> 36:32.607
She's been through so much already.

36:32.690 --> 36:36.360
Children have a way of surprising you.
They're so resilient.

36:36.861 --> 36:39.197
Now she has a chance at a healthy life.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.157
<i>You gave her that.</i>

36:41.240 --> 36:44.744
<i>Not her parents, not the FBI.</i>

36:44.827 --> 36:46.204
<i>You, Cynthia.</i>

36:50.499 --> 36:53.252
I'm so glad to be getting out of here.

36:54.754 --> 36:57.381
-Sheila Panabaker?
-Yes?

36:57.465 --> 36:58.758
You're under arrest.

36:58.841 --> 36:59.675
What?

37:01.594 --> 37:03.679
What are you doing? Stop!

37:03.763 --> 37:04.639
Marshall?

37:05.264 --> 37:07.016
Marshall? Stop it!

37:07.099 --> 37:09.018
Get your hands off of me!

37:09.101 --> 37:10.770
[Panabaker] Bottoms up, little lady.

37:12.855 --> 37:14.941
Mm. Mm!

37:15.024 --> 37:16.859
Doesn't that just hit the spot?

37:18.152 --> 37:20.696
I used to bring your daddy
to this very café

37:20.780 --> 37:23.115
when he was little,
after his hockey practice.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.867
Little but so fast.

37:26.369 --> 37:28.246
Mom doesn't let me have sweets,

37:28.329 --> 37:30.289
because I get so sick.

37:31.207 --> 37:33.167
Charlotte Anne Panabaker,

37:33.251 --> 37:36.212
this hot chocolate will not make you sick.

37:36.295 --> 37:38.256
That's a guarantee from Grandma.

37:42.677 --> 37:43.970
[chuckling]

37:44.470 --> 37:45.429
That's my girl.

38:00.361 --> 38:01.654
Dr. Jansen?

38:01.737 --> 38:04.365
Of the psychiatric clinic here, yes?

38:04.448 --> 38:07.201
-Uh, do we know each other?
-No.

38:07.702 --> 38:10.204
But we need a moment of your time, please?

38:22.717 --> 38:26.679
-Dr. Jansen?
-Please don't hurt me. I have two kids.

38:26.762 --> 38:28.597
Doctor, I have nothing but respect

38:28.681 --> 38:31.434
for professionals
who treat mental illness.

38:31.517 --> 38:35.021
It's a neglected epidemic,
and you're doing exemplary work.

38:35.104 --> 38:37.732
But I don't have time to be polite.

38:37.815 --> 38:42.028
So please, tell me
what you know about this device.

38:43.487 --> 38:44.989
Where'd this come from?

38:45.072 --> 38:47.116
You tell me and we'll both know.

38:47.908 --> 38:49.994
I'm not wildly familiar with it,

38:50.077 --> 38:53.581
but it looks to be a prototype
of something I saw last year.

38:54.332 --> 38:58.711
We were going to initiate a program
with some of my mood disorder patients.

38:58.794 --> 39:01.630
It monitors medication use.

39:01.714 --> 39:05.551
But patient advocacy groups
were worried about privacy,

39:05.634 --> 39:08.387
so the whole thing
just kind of fell apart.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.473
Who developed the device?

39:10.556 --> 39:12.099
It's a tragic story.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.226
A lot of those going around.

39:15.603 --> 39:18.522
A young man came to my office,
begging to be seen.

39:19.023 --> 39:21.734
His wife suffered from
an acute psychiatric condition.

39:21.817 --> 39:23.319
I don't recall which,

39:23.402 --> 39:26.614
but she was always
inconsistent about her meds.

39:27.406 --> 39:31.535
Then one day, she had a violent episode
that cost innocent lives.

39:32.411 --> 39:34.038
The man was devastated.

39:34.121 --> 39:37.708
He went back to school
and developed an ingestible tracker

39:37.792 --> 39:40.544
that could monitor a patient's compliance

39:40.628 --> 39:43.339
so that no one else
would have to live that nightmare.

39:43.422 --> 39:45.549
He pleaded with me
to give the tech a shot.

39:45.633 --> 39:48.010
Like I said,
I had every intention of testing it--

39:48.094 --> 39:50.221
Do you remember the man's name?

39:52.014 --> 39:53.474
It started with a K.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.935
Um, Kennison.

39:56.477 --> 39:57.603
Yes.

39:57.686 --> 40:01.690
Uh, Andrew Kennison.

40:05.528 --> 40:08.239
You wouldn't have
actually shot me, would you?

40:08.322 --> 40:11.492
If she was going to shoot you,
she would have pointed the gun at you.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.916
Hey. Got here as soon as I could.

40:18.999 --> 40:21.293
-Is this about the case?
-It's not.

40:21.377 --> 40:24.547
Agent Ressler, did you attend
your NA meeting tonight?

40:24.630 --> 40:26.465
Of course, I did. I always go--

40:27.091 --> 40:29.593
Sorry, but what's this all about? I mean--

40:31.679 --> 40:33.347
Does no one trust me?

40:33.431 --> 40:36.016
First, Aram doesn't wanna go
into the field with me.

40:36.100 --> 40:39.895
Then you guys are all talking
behind my back about my sponsor?

40:39.979 --> 40:43.190
I'm doing the meetings.
I'm doing the steps. I'm clean.

40:44.316 --> 40:48.362
-I don't need this intervention crap.
-That's not what this is.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.906
Oh, no? So, what, I'm crazy now, huh?

40:50.990 --> 40:52.825
Is that it? Great.

40:52.908 --> 40:56.579
So in case everybody has lost count,
I just got my two-month chip yesterday,

40:56.662 --> 40:59.790
from that sponsor that you guys
weren't talking about.

40:59.874 --> 41:02.084
Look, I'm trying here. Really trying.

41:02.168 --> 41:03.794
And we couldn't be prouder.

41:03.878 --> 41:05.296
[rock music playing]

41:06.422 --> 41:09.216
We knew this was a big milestone for you.

41:09.800 --> 41:14.805
We wanted your sponsor's name
in case they wanted to join us.

41:14.889 --> 41:15.723
For what?

41:15.806 --> 41:17.892
Your party. Ta-da!

41:18.517 --> 41:21.145
It took me a few tries
to pick up the cake,

41:21.228 --> 41:22.688
but I got there.

41:22.771 --> 41:23.898
Wow, wow.

41:23.981 --> 41:25.774
I also made a killer playlist.

41:25.858 --> 41:27.818
Oh, God. Not with
that damn playlist again.

41:27.902 --> 41:29.653
He's been obsessing all week.

41:30.154 --> 41:31.280
I'm really dumb.

41:32.823 --> 41:34.533
I'm sorry, I--

41:35.159 --> 41:40.498
I know I'm not always
the feelings guy, but this really--

41:42.833 --> 41:44.710
-It means...
-We know what it means.

41:44.793 --> 41:46.795
And you mean the same thing to us.

41:48.756 --> 41:50.716
Thank you. Truly.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.814
You want the big slice, yeah?

42:07.816 --> 42:09.235
Here you go.

42:21.163 --> 42:22.373
