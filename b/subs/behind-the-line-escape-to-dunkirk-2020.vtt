01:07.417 --> 01:09.414
You don't know who he is?

01:09.448 --> 01:10.548
How'd you not know?

01:10.581 --> 01:12.845
Just never got into it.

01:12.877 --> 01:14.177
Tell him, Sarge.

01:14.210 --> 01:15.510
I've never heard of him.

01:15.542 --> 01:16.375
He has.

01:16.408 --> 01:17.273
He has.

01:20.836 --> 01:22.368
You're not taking a mick.

01:22.401 --> 01:24.833
Watch the line, Private.

01:45.941 --> 01:47.874
It's Danny Finnegan.

01:47.907 --> 01:48.772
Danny Boy.

01:48.805 --> 01:50.170
The Danny Boy.

01:50.203 --> 01:51.036
Unbeaten.

01:51.070 --> 01:53.135
How many was it, Danny?

01:53.167 --> 01:54.365
Don't know.

01:54.399 --> 01:55.499
Sorry, mate.

01:55.531 --> 01:56.497
Just never got into it.

01:56.530 --> 01:57.795
It's all right.

01:57.829 --> 01:58.995
I wouldn't worry 'bout it now.

01:59.027 --> 02:00.060
He could
fight for England.

02:00.093 --> 02:00.993
If what?

02:01.025 --> 02:02.758
The war hadn't started?

02:06.819 --> 02:09.118
Mate, you should
see him on his feet.

02:09.150 --> 02:10.414
What's that thing they say?

02:10.448 --> 02:12.146
It's not about the
punches you give.

02:12.180 --> 02:13.312
It's about the ones
you don't take.

02:13.346 --> 02:14.311
Am I right?

02:14.345 --> 02:15.477
Right and left.

02:15.509 --> 02:16.908
It's like he's not
even touching the mat.

02:16.941 --> 02:18.306
Come on, show him.

02:20.370 --> 02:22.369
This one fight, right.

02:22.403 --> 02:24.002
He's still going in the 11th.

02:24.033 --> 02:24.966
Not even sweating.

02:24.999 --> 02:26.266
Sit down, you idiot.

02:26.298 --> 02:27.863
And here comes
Danny Boy Finnegan.

02:27.895 --> 02:29.262
Light on his feet as he crosses
the ring towards the pole.

02:29.295 --> 02:30.394
Harper, get down.

02:30.426 --> 02:31.326
Roger.

02:31.358 --> 02:32.724
A quick left.

02:32.758 --> 02:34.190
That one connected
like hammer on hoof.

02:34.222 --> 02:35.321
Nivinski stumbles.

02:35.355 --> 02:36.288
Danny presses.

02:36.321 --> 02:37.852
The referee steps in and.

02:46.142 --> 02:47.841
Let me see.

02:47.875 --> 02:48.708
Let me see.

02:48.741 --> 02:49.340
Let me see.

02:49.373 --> 02:50.937
Oh god.

02:50.970 --> 02:52.204
Is there a medic?

02:53.768 --> 02:54.834
He's dead.

02:54.867 --> 02:56.100
Leave him.

03:01.925 --> 03:04.124
Bill, come on, come on.

03:04.158 --> 03:06.255
What are we supposed to do?

03:06.288 --> 03:08.352
Just press and fire.

03:08.386 --> 03:10.651
Welcome to the war, lads.

03:13.447 --> 03:15.046
Come on, Billy.

03:15.079 --> 03:16.276
Billy.

03:20.106 --> 03:21.339
Just aim fire.

03:27.098 --> 03:28.263
You all right?

03:37.754 --> 03:38.752
Let's zero in.

03:40.218 --> 03:42.715
One mine is gonna completely
blow us to pieces.

03:42.749 --> 03:43.915
We need to get out of here now.

03:43.948 --> 03:45.312
You two first.

03:45.346 --> 03:46.145
Come on.

03:46.177 --> 03:47.010
I can't.

03:47.044 --> 03:48.077
I can't do it.

03:48.109 --> 03:48.941
Billy, come on.

03:50.739 --> 03:51.573
Sarge.

03:54.268 --> 03:58.031
Smythe, give me cover
and fire and don't stop.

03:58.064 --> 03:58.964
Billy.

03:58.997 --> 03:59.863
Billy.

04:00.895 --> 04:01.696
You're coming with me.

04:01.728 --> 04:02.826
You ready?

04:02.860 --> 04:03.926
One, two, three.

04:03.959 --> 04:04.959
Come on.

04:28.332 --> 04:29.931
I'm not dying here.

04:29.964 --> 04:31.762
I'm not dying here.

04:40.186 --> 04:41.185
Danny, come on.

04:46.679 --> 04:48.943
Don't stop, don't
stop, don't stop.

04:55.703 --> 04:57.236
Leave it, leave it,
leave it. Come on.

05:00.165 --> 05:01.930
What are you doing?

05:01.962 --> 05:04.526
We're not gonna use a gas
leak coming in too quick.

05:04.559 --> 05:06.092
We're gonna get steamrolled.

05:06.125 --> 05:08.955
We're not gonna die, Billy.

05:08.987 --> 05:10.287
Sir.

05:10.319 --> 05:11.784
I'll meet you fast, boys.

05:11.818 --> 05:13.717
It means we can
return fire, sir.

05:13.749 --> 05:15.647
They're gonna get
slow down there.

05:15.680 --> 05:18.178
We need to pull back.

05:18.211 --> 05:19.643
Sir, we
need to return fire.

05:19.677 --> 05:20.941
With what, private?

05:20.974 --> 05:22.207
Well where
are the Thompson's?

05:22.240 --> 05:23.640
Abandoned.

05:23.672 --> 05:25.870
What's the plan, sir?

05:27.202 --> 05:29.766
We need to run from
here to bloody Robeth.

05:29.798 --> 05:31.197
We have to pull back.

05:31.230 --> 05:33.528
Fall back any further, sir,
we're gonna be in the sea.

05:33.561 --> 05:34.726
That's the plan.

05:34.760 --> 05:35.593
A place called Dunkirk.

05:35.626 --> 05:36.792
What?

05:36.824 --> 05:38.223
The Royal Navy are
coming to take us home.

05:38.256 --> 05:39.721
Why us, sir?

05:39.755 --> 05:40.788
To hold beer.

05:40.820 --> 05:42.485
Spread the word.

05:42.518 --> 05:43.783
That's an order.

05:44.982 --> 05:46.781
Pull back, boys.

05:50.209 --> 05:51.808
Hey, we're pulling back.

05:51.841 --> 05:52.707
Let's go.

05:53.872 --> 05:55.604
Billy, he can't hear me.

05:55.638 --> 05:56.937
I'll get him.

05:58.034 --> 05:59.600
Come on, let's go.

05:59.633 --> 06:00.233
We're falling back.

06:03.561 --> 06:04.861
We were leaving.

06:04.894 --> 06:07.692
We were bloody leaving.

06:07.723 --> 06:08.523
Go.

06:31.932 --> 06:33.164
Where is everyone?

06:33.196 --> 06:34.695
I don't know.

06:35.893 --> 06:38.691
I don't recognize any of this.

06:39.855 --> 06:41.088
Where's your map?

06:43.085 --> 06:44.984
Back at the foxhole.

06:45.982 --> 06:47.481
Yeah, mine too.

06:48.647 --> 06:51.544
What was left of it anyway.

06:51.576 --> 06:54.541
We're in deep shit, Danny Boy.

06:54.573 --> 06:55.838
We're still breathing.

06:55.872 --> 06:56.971
We're lost.

07:05.528 --> 07:07.859
We gotta find that
place. What's it called?

07:09.191 --> 07:10.056
Dunkirk.

07:13.420 --> 07:14.087
We go.

07:16.783 --> 07:18.115
North.

07:18.147 --> 07:19.645
That's what we do.

07:19.678 --> 07:21.045
Go north 'til we see light.

07:21.077 --> 07:22.410
Sign post.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.941
Something we
recognize, all right.

07:23.974 --> 07:25.373
Or to sea.

07:25.407 --> 07:26.939
Yeah, or to sea, Billy.

07:26.971 --> 07:28.770
And home.

08:09.726 --> 08:11.790
Recognize any of this?

08:13.554 --> 08:16.052
Every bleeding building
here's a farmhouse, isn't it?

08:16.084 --> 08:17.951
All looks the same.

08:22.911 --> 08:23.877
Hang about.

08:25.375 --> 08:27.074
We could ask her.

08:27.105 --> 08:29.536
I don't think
we should, mate.

08:29.570 --> 08:30.569
We need to
figure out where we are.

08:30.602 --> 08:32.966
We're gonna miss
this evacuation.

08:32.999 --> 08:33.898
Come on.

08:33.931 --> 08:35.597
Slowly.

08:35.630 --> 08:37.395
Keep your eyes peeled, yeah.

08:56.839 --> 08:57.707
Excuse me.

08:58.938 --> 08:59.771
No, don't run.

08:59.803 --> 09:00.637
We're British soldiers.

09:00.670 --> 09:01.702
Hey.

09:01.735 --> 09:02.968
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:05.697 --> 09:07.029
I won't tell you again.

09:07.062 --> 09:07.995
I will shoot.

09:08.028 --> 09:09.526
I promise you I will shoot.

09:09.559 --> 09:10.958
Put it down.

09:10.992 --> 09:11.825
Put it down.

09:11.857 --> 09:12.889
I won't ask you again.

09:12.922 --> 09:14.389
Wait, wait, wait.

09:14.422 --> 09:15.354
All right, wait.

09:15.919 --> 09:16.852
Look.

09:18.417 --> 09:19.251
Okay.

09:19.283 --> 09:21.280
What are you doing?

09:21.313 --> 09:23.312
I've lowered my rifle.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.772
Just.

09:28.806 --> 09:30.437
Relax.

09:30.470 --> 09:31.704
Okay?

09:31.737 --> 09:34.601
We just wanna know where we are.

09:35.732 --> 09:37.996
We don't understand you.

09:38.028 --> 09:39.328
We're looking for the coast.

09:41.524 --> 09:42.591
Easy, easy.

09:49.383 --> 09:50.217
It's okay.

09:50.250 --> 09:51.848
He's scared.

09:51.880 --> 09:53.412
English.

09:53.446 --> 09:54.712
Thank God.

09:54.744 --> 09:57.707
Look, we're looking for
directions to the coast.

09:59.506 --> 10:00.838
The coast north.

10:00.870 --> 10:04.234
North is that way, but the
Germans are already there.

10:04.267 --> 10:05.465
Where'd you go?

10:05.498 --> 10:07.297
We're going to a
place called Dunkirk.

10:09.596 --> 10:10.694
But we need a.

10:11.926 --> 10:13.325
What's French for map?

10:14.289 --> 10:14.922
Plan.

10:14.955 --> 10:16.420
Yeah, we need a plan.

10:17.319 --> 10:19.784
Hey, I can draw you one.

10:23.279 --> 10:25.477
Come in and I'll find you food.

10:30.239 --> 10:32.571
He says you are welcome here.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.899
Do you trust him, Danny.

10:36.932 --> 10:39.164
Just keep your
rifle and your gun.

10:39.197 --> 10:39.829
Go.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.298
It is 40 kilometers.

11:07.331 --> 11:12.260
You must find Hazebrouck and
then you go north to Dunkirk.

11:12.293 --> 11:14.225
Okay, thanks.

11:15.589 --> 11:18.320
Now some food before you go.

11:28.176 --> 11:28.809
40 kilometers.

11:28.842 --> 11:30.841
What's that in miles?

11:36.235 --> 11:37.533
Sorry about Papa.

11:37.566 --> 11:39.230
He's not himself.

11:46.888 --> 11:51.417
My husband went to Lille the
day before the Germans came.

11:51.450 --> 11:54.247
We haven't seen him since.

11:54.281 --> 11:57.111
They say the Germans
shoot all the men.

12:00.174 --> 12:01.273
What in Lille?

12:01.307 --> 12:03.272
No. We were there
a couple days ago.

12:03.305 --> 12:04.404
Weren't we, Bill?

12:04.437 --> 12:06.236
Loads of men got out.

12:07.234 --> 12:08.199
Yeah.

12:08.232 --> 12:09.231
Loads.

12:15.691 --> 12:16.525
Listen.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.153
Best be off ourselves actually,

12:20.187 --> 12:21.786
so thank you for this

12:24.482 --> 12:26.247
and for the map.

12:26.280 --> 12:27.778
My pleasure.

12:27.812 --> 12:29.576
He's famous, you know.

12:29.609 --> 12:31.075
You can tell everyone you
met the great Danny Finnegan

12:31.107 --> 12:32.206
when this is over.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.140
A film star?

12:33.172 --> 12:33.804
No.

12:33.837 --> 12:34.705
Boxer.

12:36.170 --> 12:39.366
Danny, she thinks
you're a film star.

12:40.764 --> 12:41.563
Danny?

12:46.824 --> 12:47.722
Get down.

12:56.313 --> 12:57.278
He's ratting on us.

12:57.312 --> 12:58.146
He's grassed us up.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.209
No.

13:00.243 --> 13:03.339
Don't let her
look out the window.

13:03.372 --> 13:04.405
Shoot him.

13:04.438 --> 13:05.270
Don't, don't shoot.

13:05.304 --> 13:06.503
Don't you shoot.

13:06.535 --> 13:07.501
He's giving us up.

13:07.535 --> 13:08.601
You lied to us.

13:08.634 --> 13:09.467
Never, I swear.

13:09.499 --> 13:10.731
He would never.

13:10.765 --> 13:12.363
Is there any other
way out of here?

13:12.396 --> 13:13.995
What, there's no other
way out than this way?

13:14.027 --> 13:15.426
No.

13:15.458 --> 13:18.523
This is serious now, Billy.

13:18.556 --> 13:20.488
We need to find another way out.

13:20.520 --> 13:21.553
Jesus.

13:25.782 --> 13:26.613
Put it down.

13:26.646 --> 13:27.646
Put it down.

13:29.610 --> 13:30.410
Go outside.

13:30.442 --> 13:32.208
What are you doing?

13:33.141 --> 13:34.540
Go outside.

13:34.572 --> 13:37.269
They came here for you, not him.

13:41.598 --> 13:42.464
Listen.

13:43.663 --> 13:47.291
If you shoot me,
he will shoot you.

13:47.324 --> 13:49.456
They will shoot your dad.

13:51.253 --> 13:53.086
You're not like them.

13:54.550 --> 13:56.115
Come on.

14:02.474 --> 14:05.406
They are gonna shoot him, Danny.

14:09.599 --> 14:10.933
We're surrounded.

14:10.967 --> 14:12.065
What do we do now?

14:14.962 --> 14:17.093
We are soldiers, Billy.

14:18.224 --> 14:19.957
We're not heroes.

14:19.990 --> 14:22.187
- What are you doing?
- Put your rifle in your pack.

14:22.220 --> 14:24.052
We're gonna be dead
in a minute anyway.

14:24.084 --> 14:27.248
And you, Miss, you better hide.

14:27.282 --> 14:30.080
Danny, I just wanna go home.

14:41.067 --> 14:43.431
Who else is inside?

15:14.631 --> 15:17.394
Bring in these two as bargain.

15:27.416 --> 15:30.180
Where are they taking us?

15:34.009 --> 15:36.307
You are now prisoners
of the Reich.

17:00.915 --> 17:02.314
Danny Boy.

17:49.262 --> 17:53.059
That ain't spent much
on a mat, didn't they?

17:59.018 --> 18:00.117
You all right, mate?

18:06.343 --> 18:09.707
Listen, it weren't your fault.

18:09.740 --> 18:11.239
The old man.

18:11.271 --> 18:12.137
Farmer.

18:14.335 --> 18:15.635
They're Nazis.

18:16.832 --> 18:17.698
You know?

18:21.860 --> 18:23.892
I don't know, mate.

18:25.190 --> 18:27.355
I feel pretty bad inside.

18:29.185 --> 18:30.085
Yeah.

18:31.983 --> 18:33.115
Yeah, me too.

18:37.777 --> 18:39.375
Still breathing.

18:45.068 --> 18:47.033
What should we do now?

20:07.679 --> 20:09.609
Good morning.

20:09.643 --> 20:13.139
My name is
Haupstrumfuhrer Drexler

20:13.172 --> 20:16.270
and I am your jailer
until you are sent

20:16.303 --> 20:19.599
to one of our brand
new stalags in Germany.

20:19.632 --> 20:22.497
Any problems you
will come to me.

20:23.662 --> 20:25.027
My English is excellent.

20:25.059 --> 20:28.954
I was at your
university in Cambridge.

20:28.988 --> 20:30.621
But how rude of me.

20:33.317 --> 20:37.247
You know who I am but I
do not know who you are.

20:39.076 --> 20:39.944
You.

20:41.009 --> 20:42.641
What is your name?

20:44.105 --> 20:45.736
Private Williams.

20:45.770 --> 20:46.935
Williams.

20:46.969 --> 20:48.102
Hush.

20:53.196 --> 20:54.062
And you?

20:57.290 --> 21:00.188
You do know I
already have a list?

21:01.987 --> 21:03.717
Corporal Bennett.

21:08.177 --> 21:09.810
And which one of
you is Finnegan?

21:25.126 --> 21:26.459
Danny Finnegan.

21:28.723 --> 21:30.622
The great Danny Finnegan.

21:38.579 --> 21:41.909
This is turning out to
be a most excellent war

21:41.943 --> 21:44.108
and we've only just begun.

21:44.141 --> 21:45.439
Come with me.

22:05.550 --> 22:09.578
Yeah I don't mean to insult you
but this is the best I have.

22:14.773 --> 22:16.172
The Geneva Convention
on the treatments

22:16.206 --> 22:19.069
of prisoners of war clearly
states they must not

22:19.103 --> 22:24.064
be subjected to acts of
violence which is ridiculous.

22:24.096 --> 22:25.661
We're at war.

22:25.695 --> 22:27.993
This whole enterprise
is an act of violence.

22:28.026 --> 22:29.592
Don't you agree?

22:31.090 --> 22:33.519
I'm giving you a chance to

22:34.651 --> 22:38.382
to find some honor
among all this madness.

22:39.979 --> 22:43.442
I'll make it very
much worth your while.

22:43.476 --> 22:47.706
Thank you very much but
I'll not be fighting him.

22:48.804 --> 22:50.635
Not for you, sir.

22:54.996 --> 22:56.362
Think they
went over there.

22:56.395 --> 22:57.362
Shut up.

22:59.558 --> 23:01.523
Come with me.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.614
Where's he taking him?

23:08.647 --> 23:12.843
Men like us, we're not built
for the ugliness of war.

23:12.877 --> 23:16.740
We're dancers,
hunters, athletes.

23:16.773 --> 23:18.105
We are sportsman.

23:18.137 --> 23:20.568
We follow a code, you and I.

23:20.602 --> 23:22.100
A quid for the rules.

23:22.134 --> 23:25.098
The ref's word is final.

23:25.131 --> 23:29.459
Fortune has temporarily put us
on opposite sides of destiny,

23:29.492 --> 23:31.857
but I'm giving you a chance to

23:34.054 --> 23:37.717
at least to be true to yourself.

23:37.749 --> 23:40.880
Oh, I'll not be fighting
for your thrills, sir.

23:40.914 --> 23:42.078
Not for my pleasure.

23:42.112 --> 23:44.077
No, no, no, no, no.

23:44.110 --> 23:45.875
In two days time,
we shall be honored

23:45.907 --> 23:49.337
to receive a visit from
my superior officer.

23:49.370 --> 23:53.333
Obersturmbannfuhrur Lang is
a great sportsman himself.

23:53.367 --> 23:55.299
And a student.

23:55.331 --> 23:59.627
No, a true fan as the
Americans say of this noble art

24:00.825 --> 24:04.921
of which you have made
yourself such a master.

24:04.953 --> 24:08.618
You are as we say a
gift from me to him.

24:10.515 --> 24:14.378
In return, it is within my
powers to make your experience

24:14.411 --> 24:17.341
of this war
considerably improved.

24:18.772 --> 24:20.703
How 'bout the lads?

24:20.737 --> 24:23.600
Nothing to do with them.

24:23.634 --> 24:24.467
Good.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.329
Good.

24:27.363 --> 24:29.795
Well then you can let them go

24:30.958 --> 24:34.022
and I'll fight whoever you want.

24:34.055 --> 24:36.720
You know I cannot.

24:36.752 --> 24:38.651
Then neither I can.

24:40.447 --> 24:43.778
You'll come around
and you'll fight

24:43.811 --> 24:47.542
or you will find this war
very uncomfortable indeed.

25:11.481 --> 25:13.612
You've got to do this, lad.

25:13.645 --> 25:16.343
You've got to bloody
him for all of us.

25:16.376 --> 25:18.641
You wanna fight him, you do it.

25:18.674 --> 25:19.940
It ain't up to you.

25:19.972 --> 25:22.570
He's a coward is what he is.

25:22.603 --> 25:24.601
He ain't no coward.

25:24.633 --> 25:26.532
I fought with the bloke.

25:26.564 --> 25:28.396
He's right.

25:28.430 --> 25:32.293
He fights, even if he wins,
it's a victory for them.

25:32.326 --> 25:33.458
Not for us.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.656
Who asked Alibaba?

25:35.688 --> 25:37.653
I'm a French soldier Abounouom.

25:37.686 --> 25:40.383
He look French to you boys?

25:42.814 --> 25:46.644
We don't play things
for them to enjoy

25:46.676 --> 25:48.842
when and how they choose.

25:52.504 --> 25:53.936
That's what I told him.

25:53.968 --> 25:55.501
You a pacifist?

25:55.533 --> 25:56.765
Hit the bastard.

25:56.798 --> 25:57.631
I'll bloody you.

25:57.665 --> 25:58.564
Come on then.

25:58.597 --> 26:01.262
Sit down.

26:01.295 --> 26:02.592
You got us fighting
against each other

26:02.626 --> 26:05.823
when we should be fighting them.

26:05.855 --> 26:10.517
This German is very clever
with the whole boxing ploy,

26:10.551 --> 26:12.350
he distracted us
from our true duty.

26:12.382 --> 26:13.315
Sit down.

26:17.842 --> 26:18.708
Go on.

26:20.506 --> 26:21.439
Escape.

26:22.604 --> 26:25.568
Our obligation is to hit
them not in the sports arena.

26:25.601 --> 26:26.467
No.

26:28.199 --> 26:29.830
Where he hurts.

26:29.862 --> 26:30.696
In war.

26:31.927 --> 26:35.324
So we need to find
a way out of here.

26:35.358 --> 26:37.322
We need to
assess their defenses.

26:37.355 --> 26:39.352
How are
we gonna do that?

27:31.428 --> 27:33.327
Get off me.

27:42.117 --> 27:44.581
Looks like it's
wash up time, lads.

27:53.638 --> 27:55.470
We're not all gonna fit in that.

28:03.061 --> 28:05.492
Sir, what
are we looking at?

28:05.526 --> 28:09.022
MG above the gate.

28:09.056 --> 28:11.453
And another one over there.

28:11.486 --> 28:13.117
Say about 50 yards.

28:14.450 --> 28:16.314
Let's say 50 meters.

28:21.243 --> 28:23.574
I'll tell you something.

28:23.606 --> 28:26.169
He's no fool, this Drexler.

28:26.203 --> 28:30.332
He could keep 50 of us at bay
with just that one bloody gun.

28:30.365 --> 28:33.030
I don't see this as a
viable option, fellas.

28:33.063 --> 28:34.995
We're not
getting out this side.

28:35.027 --> 28:36.725
Not alive.

28:36.759 --> 28:38.590
Think he's right.

28:38.622 --> 28:40.754
Need to start looking
elsewhere, boys.

28:59.166 --> 29:00.732
Delivery bloke's not armed.

29:42.621 --> 29:43.453
Head's up, boys.

29:43.486 --> 29:44.551
Guard coming.

29:50.644 --> 29:52.677
Private Danny Finnegan.

29:52.709 --> 29:55.008
Private Jaime Williams.

29:55.040 --> 29:56.272
Come with me.

29:56.305 --> 29:58.169
All right, what's
all this about?

29:58.203 --> 29:59.602
What do they want?

30:01.199 --> 30:02.433
Come on, Jaime.

30:03.630 --> 30:04.663
Be all right.

30:06.627 --> 30:09.524
What's going on there?

30:09.556 --> 30:11.023
Don't know.

30:28.336 --> 30:29.536
I've just been on the telephone

30:29.570 --> 30:32.867
with Obersturmbannfuhrur Lang.

30:32.900 --> 30:37.095
He's very much looking forward
to watching you in action

30:37.127 --> 30:40.091
and while this is unseemly
for an officer of the Reich

30:40.125 --> 30:42.456
to negotiate with
surrendered prisoners,

30:42.488 --> 30:44.485
it is also incumbent
on the officer

30:44.519 --> 30:47.516
to adapt to immediate needs.

30:47.550 --> 30:51.580
Special circumstances
require unique solutions.

30:54.010 --> 30:58.004
I am willing to make
a one time only offer

30:58.038 --> 31:01.103
and allow let's call
them generosities

31:01.967 --> 31:04.132
to your fellow prisoners.

31:06.862 --> 31:08.227
What you got?

31:08.261 --> 31:10.358
I have some influence over
where they will send you.

31:10.391 --> 31:12.023
To which camp.

31:12.057 --> 31:15.453
Some of them you will find far
less agreeable than others.

31:15.486 --> 31:16.819
Not enough.

31:17.517 --> 31:19.248
Believe me.

31:19.282 --> 31:22.079
If you were to meet some
of old sailor colleagues,

31:22.111 --> 31:26.340
you would not regard
this offer as a trifled.

31:26.374 --> 31:29.405
Not good enough, sir.

31:29.438 --> 31:31.136
Last chance.

31:31.168 --> 31:32.534
We ain't gonna let him
fight even if he wanted to.

31:32.567 --> 31:34.132
Wait, Jaime.

31:36.497 --> 31:38.529
So what, Danny?

31:38.562 --> 31:41.858
It's all right, Danny.

31:52.013 --> 31:53.245
What doesn't he get, Danny?

32:00.336 --> 32:01.304
Hang him up.

32:02.502 --> 32:04.167
No, wait.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.299
Wait.

32:05.332 --> 32:07.929
All right stop, wait.

32:07.962 --> 32:08.795
I'll do it.

32:08.827 --> 32:10.127
I'll fight him.

32:11.324 --> 32:12.324
Excellent.

32:15.455 --> 32:19.051
How do I know you will
how do you say it,

32:20.282 --> 32:21.714
give it your all?

32:22.413 --> 32:24.378
I give you my word.

32:24.410 --> 32:25.743
Very good.

32:25.776 --> 32:27.408
Your word but what
guarantees do I have?

32:27.442 --> 32:29.473
Look, I said I'll fight him.

32:29.505 --> 32:33.468
Then let us not disturb my
man while he is training.

32:33.502 --> 32:34.934
Come with me.

32:34.966 --> 32:35.799
No, no, no.

32:35.831 --> 32:36.465
Wait, wait.

32:36.499 --> 32:37.897
I said I'll do it.

32:37.930 --> 32:39.029
I said I'll do it,
all right. I'll fight.

32:39.061 --> 32:39.993
You ain't gonna hurt him, right?

32:40.027 --> 32:41.194
Look, I will fight on my honor.

32:41.227 --> 32:43.092
Unfortunately you
missed your opportunity

32:43.124 --> 32:44.422
to act purely for honor

32:44.455 --> 32:46.488
and made this a nasty
little transaction.

32:46.520 --> 32:48.151
I said yes.

32:53.480 --> 32:57.709
The royal air force were busy
over Melville last night.

32:57.742 --> 33:00.172
Nothing to stop our
advance of course,

33:00.206 --> 33:04.702
but this morning it seems
most of the town is well,

33:04.735 --> 33:08.297
it has less need for
stairs than yesterday.

33:08.329 --> 33:12.359
I understand they will be
digging cavities out for days.

33:12.393 --> 33:16.954
Then comes the complicated task
of establishing who is who.

33:16.986 --> 33:21.416
Many of the corpses they pull
out will never be identified.

33:21.450 --> 33:26.811
One more body among so many
will not be noticed by anyone.

33:30.938 --> 33:32.170
Oh God.

33:34.734 --> 33:36.334
What have they done to you?

34:05.402 --> 34:07.732
I said I'll do it.

34:07.765 --> 34:09.230
Yes, you gave your word

34:09.264 --> 34:12.761
and now I'm reassured
you will keep it.

35:28.678 --> 35:29.975
Maybe later, eh.

36:00.044 --> 36:01.842
It's protein.

36:01.875 --> 36:04.572
Strength for your fight.

36:04.604 --> 36:06.704
I can't take your food, mate.

36:06.736 --> 36:08.135
I can't take it.

36:10.832 --> 36:13.896
These boy have lost
all their hope.

36:17.957 --> 36:23.453
If we are going to get out of
here, we need you to help us.

36:24.649 --> 36:27.480
I'm not sure I'm the
man to help them.

36:27.513 --> 36:29.213
Give us back the hope.

36:30.576 --> 36:32.741
The hope that we can win.

36:34.138 --> 36:36.603
And we will find
a way out of here.

36:45.028 --> 36:48.791
Each one of us will
starve for you to win.

37:00.643 --> 37:03.142
You lot want me to
fight this German then?

37:03.174 --> 37:04.142
Yes, lad.

37:05.839 --> 37:06.804
Not me.

37:06.837 --> 37:08.969
I just don't like the sausage.

37:48.491 --> 37:49.724
Big night tomorrow.

37:53.887 --> 37:56.051
You were right about
Jaime, you know.

37:56.083 --> 37:57.883
It changes nothing.

38:00.845 --> 38:02.644
You don't have to
go through with it.

38:02.677 --> 38:04.110
You can still back out.

38:04.142 --> 38:07.938
Time to back out was
before we joined up, mate.

38:07.971 --> 38:09.002
What are you doing here anyway?

38:09.035 --> 38:10.568
Why'd you sign up?

38:12.067 --> 38:16.962
You look like you're living
outside of East England, boy.

38:18.494 --> 38:21.490
Got charged with
burglary in '39.

38:22.755 --> 38:24.852
Went up against this judge.

38:24.886 --> 38:28.084
He was only friends
with Colonel Doyle.

38:29.447 --> 38:30.713
Gave me a choice.

38:33.043 --> 38:34.409
And here I am.

38:35.608 --> 38:38.039
Some choice he give you, huh.

38:38.071 --> 38:41.801
Well, you're gonna
lay one on this crap.

38:41.834 --> 38:44.531
You're gonna get
us back on our feet

38:44.564 --> 38:47.763
and I'm gonna find
a way out of here.

38:49.425 --> 38:50.060
Yeah.

38:51.690 --> 38:52.623
Why not?

39:09.105 --> 39:11.502
All your lads are out there.

39:11.535 --> 39:14.365
Drexler said that it'd give
it a sporting atmosphere.

39:14.399 --> 39:16.297
He's clever, ain't he?

39:16.331 --> 39:19.061
Brought them along
to see me go down.

39:19.093 --> 39:20.558
Locals, too.

39:20.592 --> 39:21.891
And full of SS.

39:23.488 --> 39:26.753
Wouldn't be surprised
if it kicks off.

39:28.749 --> 39:30.015
Right.

39:30.049 --> 39:33.511
Bill, I gotta tell
you something, mate.

39:33.545 --> 39:36.542
You see when I won my belt,
right, I beat a lot of hard men.

39:36.574 --> 39:37.707
Do you understand?

39:37.739 --> 39:38.973
I can imagine.

39:40.603 --> 39:44.799
Yeah, but once I won it,
it all changed, you know.

39:46.431 --> 39:47.663
See once you're the champ

39:47.696 --> 39:49.961
and you got the belt around
your waist, that's it.

39:49.993 --> 39:51.459
Betting goes up around you

39:51.491 --> 39:52.724
and you're living
in fantasy land.

39:52.757 --> 39:54.854
What are you saying?

39:59.484 --> 40:03.347
I ain't had a hard fight
in seven years, mate.

40:03.380 --> 40:04.645
That can't be true.

40:04.678 --> 40:06.509
I'm being serious.

40:06.541 --> 40:09.705
They've been journeyman
or they was weak opponents

40:09.739 --> 40:12.470
or sometimes it was just rigged.

40:12.502 --> 40:14.966
Danny, what are you telling me?

40:15.000 --> 40:19.761
I thought you didn't wanna
fight 'cause I don't know.

40:19.794 --> 40:22.625
Not 'cause you were scared.

40:30.283 --> 40:30.950
Get up.

40:32.614 --> 40:34.512
Don't ask him.

40:44.568 --> 40:46.932
I came to wish you a good bout

40:48.396 --> 40:51.460
and to remind you of
are understanding.

40:53.857 --> 40:56.289
And there's one more thing.

40:57.853 --> 40:58.686
Too tight?

40:58.719 --> 40:59.852
No.

40:59.885 --> 41:00.751
It's fine.

41:05.778 --> 41:08.443
You will not win this bout.

41:10.773 --> 41:12.838
Do you understand?

41:12.871 --> 41:14.702
Make it a good fight.

41:14.735 --> 41:16.633
A close fight.

41:16.667 --> 41:19.397
But if you are still standing

41:19.429 --> 41:22.327
in the 10th round,
you will go down.

41:24.657 --> 41:26.921
If you are still standing.

41:31.682 --> 41:33.780
You sure that's not too tight?

41:35.911 --> 41:37.144
I do not need to remind you

41:37.177 --> 41:40.141
of the sincerity
of my conviction.

41:40.174 --> 41:41.439
I'm quite sure you don't want it

41:41.472 --> 41:45.135
to be me strapping up
your hands next time.

41:46.534 --> 41:48.499
Careful, sir.

41:48.531 --> 41:50.462
Your sportsmanship
and your honor seems

41:50.495 --> 41:52.660
to be slipping a bit.

41:52.693 --> 41:53.594
Please.

41:53.626 --> 41:55.458
You're not stupid.

41:55.490 --> 41:57.455
It's never a matter of honor.

41:57.487 --> 41:59.552
Only a Finnegan losing.

41:59.586 --> 42:01.318
We're at war.

42:01.350 --> 42:05.214
Victorious warriors win
first then go to war,

42:06.678 --> 42:11.341
while defeated warriors go
to war first then try to win.

42:14.302 --> 42:15.635
That big fellow out there,
does he know I'm going down?

42:15.668 --> 42:17.334
Does he?

42:17.366 --> 42:20.098
Rottenfuhrer Bartho
Kraus has his own orders.

42:24.160 --> 42:27.189
He will be trying to kill you.

42:27.222 --> 42:28.222
Good luck.

43:06.713 --> 43:07.580
Listen.

43:12.772 --> 43:14.104
Tell you later.

43:46.302 --> 43:50.199
From the Waffen SS
Panzer Division,

43:50.232 --> 43:53.096
Rottenfuhrer Bartho Kraus.

43:59.322 --> 44:00.621
Danny Finnegan.

44:03.650 --> 44:07.081
British expedition
core representative.

44:12.074 --> 44:13.374
Heil Hitler.

44:45.173 --> 44:48.237
Danny, forget about
what happened before.

44:48.269 --> 44:49.701
It's all gone now.

44:49.735 --> 44:52.965
Just get out there
and win it for us.

44:54.130 --> 44:56.694
I don't know what
I'm supposed to say.

44:56.727 --> 44:58.226
I don't even know the
rules to be honest.

44:58.259 --> 45:00.356
I don't think there
are any to know, mate.

45:00.390 --> 45:01.257
Here.

45:03.287 --> 45:06.083
Keep your feet lively and
hit him hard I suppose.

45:18.570 --> 45:21.100
Distance, Danny.

45:25.462 --> 45:26.263
Danny.

45:26.295 --> 45:27.326
Come on, Danny.

45:42.210 --> 45:44.076
Yes, boy, come on, Danny.

45:44.108 --> 45:45.007
Come on.

45:45.041 --> 45:45.908
Yes boy, Danny.

45:45.940 --> 45:46.540
Yes boy.

45:46.572 --> 45:47.404
One.

45:50.369 --> 45:51.301
You got him.

45:51.334 --> 45:52.467
He's out.

45:52.499 --> 45:53.998
No, not this round.

45:57.660 --> 45:59.226
Six.

45:59.260 --> 46:00.958
Seven.

46:00.990 --> 46:02.189
Eight.

46:02.223 --> 46:03.056
Nine.

46:03.089 --> 46:04.154
Okay.

46:54.532 --> 46:55.964
He's good.

46:55.996 --> 46:57.163
You're better.

46:58.527 --> 47:01.458
Danny, you're
gonna win this one.

47:01.491 --> 47:02.357
Come on.

47:51.271 --> 47:53.303
Danny, you look amazing.

47:54.767 --> 47:57.764
He can't handle you,
you beautiful boy.

47:57.797 --> 47:58.697
Yeah, what?

47:59.529 --> 48:01.827
Where's the wrestling gum?

48:01.859 --> 48:02.926
Where does it go?

48:02.958 --> 48:04.988
Put it on the cut.

48:05.021 --> 48:05.854
I see.

48:07.154 --> 48:09.884
Just on the cuts I said.

48:09.917 --> 48:11.182
What's it for anyway?

48:11.216 --> 48:13.313
The shots, they slip off.

48:13.346 --> 48:15.244
Does it work?

48:15.277 --> 48:16.243
We'll find out, won't we?

48:16.277 --> 48:17.308
Come on.

48:18.209 --> 48:19.441
Here we go.

49:12.782 --> 49:14.879
You've got him.

49:14.913 --> 49:17.277
You've got him now.

49:17.310 --> 49:18.377
What round is it?

49:18.409 --> 49:19.841
10.

49:19.874 --> 49:21.039
This is it.

49:21.072 --> 49:21.972
Clobber him.

49:22.005 --> 49:23.704
Finish him off.

49:23.737 --> 49:25.369
Lay one on the bastard.

49:55.068 --> 49:56.301
Come on, Danny.

49:56.334 --> 49:57.833
Three to get up. You
can do it, get up.

49:57.867 --> 49:58.666
One.

49:58.699 --> 49:59.765
Stand up.

49:59.798 --> 50:00.330
Get up.

50:00.363 --> 50:01.196
Come on, get up.

50:01.230 --> 50:02.728
Come on.

50:02.760 --> 50:03.760
Stand up.

50:10.187 --> 50:11.019
Get up.

50:11.051 --> 50:12.284
Danny, up.

50:24.004 --> 50:24.836
Danny, get up.

50:24.870 --> 50:25.803
Come on.

50:25.835 --> 50:28.233
Get up, come on.

50:29.764 --> 50:31.163
Six.

50:31.196 --> 50:32.095
Seven.

50:39.155 --> 50:40.854
Come on,
Danny, breathe.

50:40.886 --> 50:41.718
Get up.

50:41.752 --> 50:42.951
You can do it.

50:44.015 --> 50:44.848
Come on.

50:46.047 --> 50:47.513
Nine.

53:17.815 --> 53:19.049
Danny?

54:05.697 --> 54:07.396
And they're all
smiling and cheering

54:07.428 --> 54:08.827
'cause they think
they've got him licked,

54:08.861 --> 54:10.327
but our lad won't stay down.

54:10.359 --> 54:12.856
No, our glorious warrior
clambers to his feet

54:12.889 --> 54:15.586
and drawing on deep wells of
strength no one knew he had.

54:15.618 --> 54:16.951
Not even himself.

54:16.984 --> 54:19.416
He lunges across the ring.

54:19.449 --> 54:22.513
And as the big Bavarian
beast comes right at him.

54:22.546 --> 54:23.377
Ph.

54:23.410 --> 54:24.443
Ph.

54:24.477 --> 54:25.643
Ph.

54:25.675 --> 54:27.042
But our crowd killer
counters with a left.

54:27.075 --> 54:29.306
And a right and another
left and another.

54:29.338 --> 54:30.703
And then the boy
from Bethnal Green

54:30.736 --> 54:31.901
goes in for the coup de grace.

54:44.654 --> 54:45.887
It's all right, Bill.

54:45.919 --> 54:47.351
What does
he bloody want?

55:13.024 --> 55:15.389
You have a fast right.

55:15.422 --> 55:16.453
A strong left.

55:17.518 --> 55:19.251
You have fought well.

55:20.282 --> 55:22.015
Congratulations.

55:26.042 --> 55:29.839
This is all very well beating
a private from the ranks.

55:29.871 --> 55:30.837
A beast.

55:34.434 --> 55:37.332
Had a good technique
and full of spirit,

55:37.365 --> 55:41.228
but lacking shall we
say true Aryan physique.

55:43.725 --> 55:47.953
You will never win
against a real champion.

55:50.549 --> 55:51.881
My champion.

55:58.475 --> 56:00.539
Maximus Sennenhund
was a world champion.

56:00.571 --> 56:01.604
Heavyweight.

56:03.735 --> 56:04.601
He's dead.

56:09.695 --> 56:12.726
I agree to one
fight with your man.

56:13.858 --> 56:15.790
Not gonna be your play thing.

56:19.785 --> 56:21.249
Play thing?

56:25.346 --> 56:26.212
Games.

56:28.374 --> 56:30.473
You think these are games?

56:39.263 --> 56:42.161
Everything we do
is for a purpose.

56:42.194 --> 56:44.325
National socialism
does not consist

56:44.357 --> 56:48.387
of grand gestures
and extravagant acts.

56:48.419 --> 56:49.719
It is an attitude.

56:52.483 --> 56:53.682
A way of life.

56:59.707 --> 57:02.106
Millions of tiny acts a day.

57:03.603 --> 57:07.833
Each one in themselves is
nothing like a raindrop,

57:09.198 --> 57:13.493
but together they create
the fury of a storm.

57:27.844 --> 57:30.740
I have made the
necessary arrangements

57:30.773 --> 57:32.872
and delayed your
departure to Germany.

57:34.504 --> 57:36.534
You'll have one week to heal

57:36.567 --> 57:41.729
and you'll all be taken to a
prison camp south of Bailleul.

57:42.428 --> 57:43.095
But.

57:44.227 --> 57:46.524
The night before you leave.

57:47.455 --> 57:49.455
You will fight my man

57:51.852 --> 57:53.550
and you will lose.

58:07.467 --> 58:09.066
What happened to your man?

58:09.100 --> 58:10.632
Man I just fought.

58:12.862 --> 58:16.192
Mr. Kraus has been transferred.

58:20.253 --> 58:22.119
I told you to go down.

58:24.149 --> 58:27.312
We have kept your friends
in here as insurance.

58:27.345 --> 58:30.476
If you deviate again,
everyone in that barn

58:30.508 --> 58:32.107
will find themselves
at the bottom

58:32.141 --> 58:35.472
of a bomb flattened
French schoolhouse.

58:46.060 --> 58:47.491
A week but where?

58:48.556 --> 58:51.186
Didn't say specifically.

58:51.219 --> 58:52.452
Germany.

58:52.484 --> 58:55.515
That's all the
specifically we need.

58:55.549 --> 58:58.380
And while you've
all been having fun

58:58.412 --> 59:01.742
setting up your little fan club,

59:01.775 --> 59:04.339
you've forgotten what we
are and where we're heading.

59:04.373 --> 59:05.306
We're not
heading anywhere.

59:05.338 --> 59:07.037
We're going home, aren't we?

59:07.070 --> 59:08.534
So what you gonna box your
way out of Germany now?

59:08.567 --> 59:10.033
No actually.

59:10.066 --> 59:11.531
I'm not gonna box my
way out of Germany.

59:11.564 --> 59:12.432
So what?

59:14.728 --> 59:16.160
Well we're gonna escape

59:16.192 --> 59:17.591
before we're even taken
to Germany, aren't we?

59:17.624 --> 59:20.254
That bloke punched
your head too hard.

59:20.288 --> 59:22.088
He's right.

59:22.120 --> 59:24.718
We need to escape this week.

59:24.750 --> 59:27.249
And how we gonna do that?

59:30.078 --> 59:31.343
I don't know.

59:34.773 --> 59:37.070
Well we better
think of something.

59:37.103 --> 59:40.300
Otherwise you're gonna
have to fight that monster

59:40.334 --> 59:43.131
and then we're all
headed for Germany.

59:43.163 --> 59:44.329
Not all.

59:44.363 --> 59:45.562
Not Danny.

59:45.595 --> 59:47.626
I can't see you surviving
even three rounds

59:47.659 --> 59:50.389
with that mountain of meat.

59:50.421 --> 59:51.355
There you go, lad.

59:51.388 --> 59:52.554
Always a bright side, eh.

01:00:49.058 --> 01:00:53.388
What you said about the
fight before the war,

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:56.251
I'm sorry I called you scared.

01:00:56.284 --> 01:00:57.116
I was wrong.

01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:57.949
Ah, you weren't.

01:00:57.981 --> 01:00:59.580
I was scared.

01:00:59.614 --> 01:01:02.311
I don't care what you
did or you didn't do.

01:01:02.343 --> 01:01:03.510
Poor blokes like
us are always gonna

01:01:03.542 --> 01:01:05.542
have our fight through
a battle ridge.

01:01:05.575 --> 01:01:08.272
I mean, look around you.

01:01:12.567 --> 01:01:14.031
Billy.

01:01:14.064 --> 01:01:15.597
Billy, look who it is.

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:17.528
The delivery bloke.

01:01:17.562 --> 01:01:18.594
No, that's no bloke, mate.

01:01:18.626 --> 01:01:20.490
Look.

01:01:20.523 --> 01:01:21.357
It's that girl.

01:01:21.391 --> 01:01:22.489
The girl from the farm.

01:01:25.885 --> 01:01:28.149
It's our answer, isn't it?

01:01:30.081 --> 01:01:31.979
Come with me, Billy.

01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:35.043
What are we doing?

01:01:42.533 --> 01:01:44.099
Sorry Archie,
I'll explain later.

01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:46.863
Come here, Finnegan.

01:01:50.258 --> 01:01:51.424
Stop it, wait.

01:01:51.457 --> 01:01:52.590
Get off it.

01:01:52.622 --> 01:01:54.854
Back off me.

01:01:54.888 --> 01:01:56.253
We're
on the same side.

01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:19.861
Hey.

01:02:19.893 --> 01:02:20.826
Go away.

01:02:20.859 --> 01:02:21.992
I need to talk to you.

01:02:22.025 --> 01:02:23.956
No, you'll get us
both killed. Go away.

01:02:23.989 --> 01:02:25.055
Wait, I just.

01:02:25.088 --> 01:02:28.184
I'm calling the guard.

01:02:28.217 --> 01:02:29.284
Come on then.

01:02:29.316 --> 01:02:31.349
You yellow rat.

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:33.345
All right when he
comes, just drive, yeah.

01:02:33.378 --> 01:02:34.544
Don't
you get in my cart.

01:03:43.236 --> 01:03:44.169
Whoa.

01:03:47.033 --> 01:03:48.465
What are you doing here?

01:03:48.496 --> 01:03:49.830
I just want to
talk to you, okay.

01:03:49.862 --> 01:03:51.360
No, you ruined everything.

01:03:51.394 --> 01:03:52.460
It wasn't our fault.

01:03:52.492 --> 01:03:54.158
We were surrounded.

01:03:54.192 --> 01:03:56.123
What are
you talking about?

01:03:56.154 --> 01:03:58.820
What your dad at the farm.

01:03:58.852 --> 01:03:59.751
No, not at the farm.

01:03:59.785 --> 01:04:00.685
At the box.

01:04:00.718 --> 01:04:01.351
The box?

01:04:01.383 --> 01:04:03.082
At the fighting.

01:04:03.115 --> 01:04:05.713
The commander, I had him
and you ruined everything.

01:04:05.745 --> 01:04:07.643
Who's the commander?

01:04:09.207 --> 01:04:10.440
It was perfect.

01:04:10.473 --> 01:04:12.371
Every eye on the place
was watching you.

01:04:16.701 --> 01:04:17.333
Except me.

01:04:20.162 --> 01:04:21.795
And I was about to.

01:04:27.021 --> 01:04:28.687
And then you leap up.

01:04:31.984 --> 01:04:32.950
He moves.

01:04:36.211 --> 01:04:37.377
You took away my one chance.

01:04:37.411 --> 01:04:38.644
You ruined everything.

01:04:38.677 --> 01:04:39.842
Now go away.

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:41.008
How was I supposed to
know that was your plan?

01:04:41.041 --> 01:04:43.904
I could see out of
one eye on the night.

01:04:43.936 --> 01:04:46.834
It
doesn't matter now.

01:04:46.868 --> 01:04:50.631
Okay, what if you could have
another go at the commander?

01:04:50.663 --> 01:04:51.995
I'm listening.

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:57.622
Look, do you have friends?

01:04:57.655 --> 01:04:59.020
Friends you trust?

01:04:59.054 --> 01:05:00.154
To do what?

01:05:03.017 --> 01:05:05.247
I'm still working it out,
but just can you find them?

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.945
I think so but to do what?

01:05:07.978 --> 01:05:09.643
Just find them, all right.

01:05:09.675 --> 01:05:10.873
Yeah, but what is your plan?

01:05:10.906 --> 01:05:12.772
Halt, halt.

01:06:01.054 --> 01:06:02.152
Got it.

01:06:02.185 --> 01:06:04.017
What was all that about?

01:06:04.050 --> 01:06:05.649
What did she say?

01:06:05.681 --> 01:06:08.213
Didn't really get that
far if I'm honest.

01:06:08.245 --> 01:06:10.210
So what did you talk about?

01:06:10.243 --> 01:06:12.706
It was weird, Sarge.

01:06:12.739 --> 01:06:16.036
She said at the fight
she was gonna kill Lang.

01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:17.735
What?

01:06:17.769 --> 01:06:18.600
Who her?

01:06:18.633 --> 01:06:19.633
How?

01:06:20.498 --> 01:06:23.828
She said she smuggled
in a knife in her coat.

01:06:23.861 --> 01:06:24.693
And you saw the place.

01:06:24.727 --> 01:06:25.993
It was packed.

01:06:26.027 --> 01:06:26.959
And she's slipping
through the crowd.

01:06:26.991 --> 01:06:28.856
She's going for row after row.

01:06:28.889 --> 01:06:30.221
Not a guard's noticed her.

01:06:30.255 --> 01:06:34.118
She's about a foot
away from Lang.

01:06:34.151 --> 01:06:37.215
A foot away from
slitting his throat.

01:06:39.111 --> 01:06:42.908
All because they're all
fixated on the fight.

01:06:49.867 --> 01:06:50.899
Danny.

01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:54.828
We need to contact Chantalle.

01:06:54.861 --> 01:06:57.692
We need to send a
message to Chantalle.

01:06:57.725 --> 01:07:00.189
Get that bit of paper
and your pencil, Maurice.

01:07:00.221 --> 01:07:01.787
We gotta write her a note

01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:02.887
'cause I ain't gonna
get close enough

01:07:02.919 --> 01:07:05.584
to tell her in person again.

01:07:05.616 --> 01:07:08.214
Tell her she calls everyone
she can trust, all right.

01:07:10.512 --> 01:07:11.677
Soldier?

01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:12.709
No, locals.

01:07:12.741 --> 01:07:14.972
There ain't any soldiers left.

01:07:15.006 --> 01:07:18.103
Now we ask each person to
bring a couple of coats.

01:07:18.135 --> 01:07:19.468
Coats.

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:21.567
And bring them to the fight.

01:07:21.599 --> 01:07:26.761
Now we get each one of them
to slip a coat on one of yous.

01:07:28.259 --> 01:07:32.188
And then while everyone's
watching the fight, you slip out.

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:34.752
Slip out?

01:07:34.785 --> 01:07:35.818
Are you crazy?

01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:37.681
We're gonna get
caught in minutes.

01:07:37.714 --> 01:07:40.012
No because I'm gonna
give them a fight

01:07:40.046 --> 01:07:41.611
that they can't
take their eyes off.

01:07:45.739 --> 01:07:47.771
What about you?

01:07:47.804 --> 01:07:49.502
I'm going down in the fifth.

01:07:54.198 --> 01:07:56.029
One of you will have
to sneak me out.

01:07:56.062 --> 01:07:59.059
Or carry me to
where I get changed.

01:08:00.156 --> 01:08:01.955
The room's guarded at the front,

01:08:01.987 --> 01:08:04.951
but the lock out
the back is busted.

01:08:04.985 --> 01:08:06.650
One pull on that and the
next thing we'll be seeing

01:08:06.682 --> 01:08:09.547
is the white cliffs of Dover.

01:08:09.579 --> 01:08:11.412
You're joking, right?

01:08:11.446 --> 01:08:13.576
No, I'm not joking, Maurice.

01:08:13.608 --> 01:08:15.640
In fact, if any of
yous got a better idea,

01:08:15.674 --> 01:08:18.537
best speak up now 'cause
if this don't come off

01:08:18.569 --> 01:08:22.466
in about three days we're
gonna be trapped in Germany.

01:08:22.497 --> 01:08:24.596
We'll be surrounded by Nazis.

01:08:24.631 --> 01:08:26.462
The star hub.

01:08:26.495 --> 01:08:27.694
Secret police.

01:08:31.890 --> 01:08:34.087
We're still in France, boys.

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.020
Yeah?

01:08:36.185 --> 01:08:38.915
Still a war going on.

01:08:38.947 --> 01:08:40.479
He's right.

01:08:40.514 --> 01:08:43.544
We need to get out before
they take us to Germany

01:08:43.575 --> 01:08:46.073
while there's still
chaos out there.

01:08:46.106 --> 01:08:49.470
Then what then?

01:08:49.504 --> 01:08:50.470
Dunkirk.

01:08:52.932 --> 01:08:53.799
Yeah.

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:55.796
Then home.

01:09:02.522 --> 01:09:04.020
You got all that?

01:09:04.055 --> 01:09:05.453
Good.

01:09:05.486 --> 01:09:06.651
Now we just gotta
make sure she gets it

01:09:06.684 --> 01:09:07.983
'cause all our hopes
of getting out of here

01:09:08.015 --> 01:09:10.781
are on that one
little bit of paper.

01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:12.013
We can't risk them catching me

01:09:12.046 --> 01:09:15.942
anywhere near her again
or she's dead, too.

01:09:15.975 --> 01:09:18.106
We're gonna need
another diversion.

01:09:18.138 --> 01:09:20.669
We gotta make sure
every screw's eyes

01:09:20.703 --> 01:09:22.401
ain't anywhere near me.

01:09:22.433 --> 01:09:23.567
The Krauts will
already be on edge

01:09:23.599 --> 01:09:25.430
after this little fiasco.

01:09:25.465 --> 01:09:27.729
They won't fall for
fisticuffs twice.

01:09:27.761 --> 01:09:28.593
He's right.

01:09:28.627 --> 01:09:30.692
Yeah, he is, isn't he?

01:09:31.890 --> 01:09:33.788
Let's think of something else.

01:09:33.823 --> 01:09:35.587
Something bigger.

01:09:35.618 --> 01:09:36.653
Much bigger.

01:09:37.751 --> 01:09:39.417
I've got an idea.

01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:52.837
Do it.

01:10:52.869 --> 01:10:55.600
Do it before I change my mind.

01:11:01.426 --> 01:11:02.259
What?

01:11:04.258 --> 01:11:04.923
Ah.

01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:07.620
Medic.

01:11:07.654 --> 01:11:08.653
You bastard.

01:11:08.684 --> 01:11:09.784
Medic.

01:11:09.818 --> 01:11:10.649
Doctor.

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:11.616
We need a doctor.

01:11:17.409 --> 01:11:18.243
Doctor.

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:19.307
Doctor.

01:11:22.971 --> 01:11:23.836
I need a medic.

01:11:23.869 --> 01:11:25.667
We need a doctor.

01:11:25.701 --> 01:11:28.565
Look at my hand.

01:11:28.597 --> 01:11:29.929
Doctor, doctor.

01:12:45.814 --> 01:12:47.478
Well lads.

01:12:47.512 --> 01:12:48.744
We've done our bit.

01:12:48.777 --> 01:12:51.841
Let's hope the girl does hers.

01:12:51.874 --> 01:12:55.471
Never was much one
with an ax, Billy.

01:12:57.167 --> 01:12:58.632
She better find that note.

01:12:58.665 --> 01:13:03.128
Or I'll never play the piano
never again for nothing.

01:13:03.162 --> 01:13:03.794
Oh God, mate.

01:13:03.827 --> 01:13:06.325
You played the piano?

01:13:06.357 --> 01:13:08.222
Could've learned.

01:13:11.385 --> 01:13:12.452
Not anymore.

01:13:15.581 --> 01:13:16.647
She'll find it.

01:13:17.779 --> 01:13:18.845
How'd you know?

01:13:18.877 --> 01:13:20.409
She will.

01:13:20.442 --> 01:13:24.439
Well if she doesn't,
we're all dead.

01:14:24.472 --> 01:14:25.571
So stupid.

01:14:33.197 --> 01:14:34.362
Idiot.

01:14:50.644 --> 01:14:55.607
You're all missing the one
main flaw with this plan.

01:14:57.336 --> 01:14:58.970
This is only gonna work
if you survive long enough

01:14:59.002 --> 01:15:00.502
for us to get out.

01:15:01.665 --> 01:15:03.064
You don't even
know if you can go

01:15:03.097 --> 01:15:04.263
at least five rounds
with that beast.

01:15:04.297 --> 01:15:06.161
He's a monster, he is.

01:15:07.426 --> 01:15:09.224
It's whether or not
you can stay alive.

01:15:29.301 --> 01:15:33.631
I came to say goodbye in
case you don't make it.

01:15:35.028 --> 01:15:35.896
Okay.

01:15:39.425 --> 01:15:43.321
I believe if things
had been different,

01:15:43.354 --> 01:15:46.385
we would've been
friends you and I.

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:51.245
You're not here to tell me

01:15:51.278 --> 01:15:54.142
to take another
dive, are you, sir?

01:15:55.374 --> 01:15:56.873
On the contrary.

01:15:57.705 --> 01:15:58.538
Tonight.

01:15:59.468 --> 01:16:02.301
I want you to give it your all.

01:16:05.929 --> 01:16:07.960
That's your only way out
of this with your honor.

01:16:07.993 --> 01:16:10.259
He's gonna knock your
boy's head clean off.

01:16:10.291 --> 01:16:12.489
I look forward to him trying.

01:16:12.522 --> 01:16:15.187
The third SS Panzer
Division will be talking

01:16:15.219 --> 01:16:19.348
about this evening
for a very long time.

01:16:19.382 --> 01:16:21.146
Yeah, you can bet on it.

01:16:30.903 --> 01:16:32.335
One way or another.

01:16:34.565 --> 01:16:35.498
Finnegan.

01:16:37.229 --> 01:16:38.095
Good luck.

01:16:52.479 --> 01:16:54.543
Yes, yes, yes.

01:17:32.069 --> 01:17:33.301
You're
too quick for him.

01:17:37.529 --> 01:17:40.260
I doubt I have
five rounds of it.

01:17:40.294 --> 01:17:41.559
Get them ready.

01:17:42.989 --> 01:17:44.888
Here we go again.

01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:50.385
How we getting on?

01:19:50.419 --> 01:19:51.385
Three have got out.

01:19:51.417 --> 01:19:53.914
Harry, Rich, and Zaid.

01:19:53.948 --> 01:19:55.114
It's actually working.

01:19:55.146 --> 01:19:57.711
They'll be halfway
to the coast by now.

01:19:57.744 --> 01:19:59.276
We get Archie and
Maurice out next.

01:19:59.308 --> 01:20:00.242
All right, come on.

01:20:00.274 --> 01:20:01.307
And then it's us.

01:20:01.339 --> 01:20:03.338
I'm gonna go check on the door.

01:20:47.657 --> 01:20:49.022
They found the door.

01:20:49.055 --> 01:20:49.921
They sealed it up.

01:20:49.953 --> 01:20:50.820
Come on.

01:20:51.751 --> 01:20:53.318
Out back.

01:20:53.351 --> 01:20:55.149
There's no way out.

01:21:26.714 --> 01:21:27.747
All right.

01:21:27.779 --> 01:21:29.078
What's up?

01:21:29.111 --> 01:21:31.909
You gotta get out of here now.

01:21:31.941 --> 01:21:34.073
I ain't leaving you.

01:21:34.105 --> 01:21:35.904
You go, mate.

01:21:35.937 --> 01:21:37.069
Go on.

01:21:37.103 --> 01:21:38.635
We're sticking together, mate.

01:21:38.667 --> 01:21:40.132
We'll find another
way out of Germany.

01:21:40.165 --> 01:21:41.032
Hey.

01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:44.694
You gotta let me win
one on my own, mate.

01:21:48.823 --> 01:21:50.055
You ain't gonna win.

01:21:50.088 --> 01:21:52.853
We already have, Billy.

01:21:52.886 --> 01:21:53.951
Billy.

01:21:53.983 --> 01:21:55.948
Cover and fire.

01:21:55.982 --> 01:21:57.615
No, no, no.

01:22:29.179 --> 01:22:30.179
Come on.

01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:46.290
