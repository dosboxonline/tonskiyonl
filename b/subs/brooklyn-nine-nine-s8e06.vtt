What a bunch of bunk.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.702
Why'd the perp run away unless
he was guilty of something?

07:32.785 --> 07:34.412
Because he was understandably scared

07:34.495 --> 07:35.663
of interacting with a cop.

07:35.746 --> 07:37.165
I see-- well, that excuse hasn't worked

07:37.248 --> 07:40.376
in the last 15 cases against Marzipan,
and I don't think it'll work now.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.502
15?

07:41.586 --> 07:43.463
Peralta, I can make all of this disappear.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.047
That's what the police union does.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.924
But you got to play ball with me, son.
What do you say?

07:48.593 --> 07:51.554
Sir, can I speak with you
in private, please?

07:51.637 --> 07:53.181
I just had an epiphany.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.765
That you're fallible
and you made an M word.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.477
Absolutely not.
This whole thing is a setup!

08:14.452 --> 08:17.079
all out in the open
like some common candy ho?

08:17.163 --> 08:18.956
-You're just jealous.
-Boyle, where's my candy?

08:19.040 --> 08:20.625
-What?
-The box is full of sand.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.127
Or maybe it's sugar.
[spits] Oh, it's not sugar.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.004
It's sand. Is this some sort of sick joke?

08:25.087 --> 08:26.422
There was candy in there earlier.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.216
-Maybe it fell out?
-I don't want excuses, bitch!

08:28.299 --> 08:29.383
I want my candy!

08:29.467 --> 08:30.510
The vending machine is broken,

08:30.593 --> 08:31.594
and you're my only snack source.

08:31.677 --> 08:32.762
He doesn't have to be.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.639
I still have your purchase order.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.224
You. You did this.

08:36.307 --> 08:38.893
Please, I would never do
something that childish,

08:38.976 --> 08:40.811
and you would know that if you
weren't a big, stinky dumb-dumb

08:40.895 --> 08:42.063
who smelled like butts.

08:42.146 --> 08:44.023
Okay, so here's what I'm thinking.

08:44.106 --> 08:46.275
The union set me up. Think about it.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.860
O'Sullivan told Amy if she
didn't drop her pilot program,

08:47.944 --> 08:49.654
"she'd be sorry," and now suddenly,

08:49.737 --> 08:50.905
I'm being threatened with suspension?

08:50.988 --> 08:52.782
Sure, but he threatened her, not you.

08:52.865 --> 08:53.950
We're married. We're a team.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.661
Really? What about when I wanted
to run a half marathon together

08:56.744 --> 08:58.079
and you told me to rot in hell?

08:58.162 --> 08:59.622
That was clearly a playful joke.

08:59.705 --> 09:00.998
So will you run the half marathon with me?

09:01.082 --> 09:02.875
No, I would die!

09:02.959 --> 09:04.544
Look, O'Sullivan said he could
make my suspension go away

09:04.627 --> 09:05.920
if just "played ball."

09:06.003 --> 09:07.129
He's clearly trying to get me

09:07.213 --> 09:08.589
to lean on you to kill your program.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.007
This doesn't sound like a setup.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.717
O'Sullivan didn't make you
arrest an innocent man.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.302
Or did he? Think about it.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.971
Marzipan, who I never liked, by the way,

09:15.054 --> 09:16.764
was the one who gave me
the address to the bus lot.

09:16.847 --> 09:18.432
I think he and O'Sullivan made sure

09:18.516 --> 09:20.184
there was a "suspect" there
for me to arrest.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.852
You think the victim was a plant?

09:21.936 --> 09:23.604
I didn't believe it either
until I checked the guy's file.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.022
Guess what he does for a living?

09:25.106 --> 09:27.358
Actor. Huh?

09:27.441 --> 09:30.027
-Come on, sir, you hate actors!
-I don't hate actors.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.321
I hate colleges
that award diplomas for acting.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.198
I mean, I wouldn't put it past O'Sullivan.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.158
He is desperate to kill
our reform program.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.952
True, he tried to blackmail me before.

09:38.035 --> 09:39.287
If you don't give me what I want,

09:39.370 --> 09:41.539
I will release proof
that you are a homosexual.

09:41.622 --> 09:44.834
-I came out 30 years ago.
-Ah, you're impossible.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.128
So you agree it was a setup.
I have your unbridled support?

09:47.211 --> 09:48.963
My support is extremely bridled.

09:49.046 --> 09:51.048
You have circumstantial evidence at best.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.800
All right, then I guess
we just have to prove it.

09:52.883 --> 09:54.427
Absolutely not.

09:54.510 --> 09:56.470
You can't investigate your accuser.

09:56.554 --> 09:57.888
It's retaliation.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.432
Which is why the investigation will focus

09:59.515 --> 10:02.059
only on O'Sullivan and be led
by someone from the outside.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.020
A friend, a confidant, a--

10:04.103 --> 10:06.230
-Diaz.
-Yes.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.608
Damn it, you kind of stepped
on the dramatic entrance

10:08.691 --> 10:09.984
we had planned, and you threw off our…

10:10.067 --> 10:11.611
-Me.
-Timing.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.112
The point is Amy and Rosa
will head up the investigation,

10:13.195 --> 10:14.238
and the entrance worked perfectly.

10:14.322 --> 10:15.281
Interesting, you two are sure

10:15.364 --> 10:16.365
you want to be involved with this?

10:16.449 --> 10:17.742
Investigating O'Sullivan?

10:17.825 --> 10:19.452
Yeah, that dude sucks.
He tried to blackmail me.

10:19.535 --> 10:21.245
If you don't stop harassing my officers,

10:21.329 --> 10:23.080
I will release proof
that you are bisexual.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.790
-Already came out.
-Oh, come on.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.709
You can't blackmail anyone anymore.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.169
Okay, so here's the plan.

10:28.252 --> 10:30.379
O'Sullivan likes to do deals over drinks.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.256
<i>So I invite him to Shaw's</i>
<i>and order us a couple beers.</i>

10:32.340 --> 10:34.091
<i>I nod along as he talks</i>

10:34.175 --> 10:35.676
<i>about how surprisingly cool his mom is.</i>

10:35.760 --> 10:36.886
<i>Order more beers.</i>

10:36.969 --> 10:38.220
<i>I also nod along as he talks</i>

10:38.304 --> 10:39.764
<i>about how horrible his ex-wife is.</i>

10:39.847 --> 10:41.349
<i>Order more beers.</i>

10:41.432 --> 10:42.850
<i>I also nod along as he kind of implies</i>

10:42.933 --> 10:44.143
<i>he wishes his mom was his wife.</i>

10:44.226 --> 10:46.687
Nobody spoons like my mom.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.397
<i>But I'm not the only one</i>
<i>who's one listening.</i>

10:48.481 --> 10:49.607
<i>O'Sullivan's a blowhard,</i>

10:49.690 --> 10:51.275
<i>so he just needs a little push.</i>

10:51.359 --> 10:53.361
<i>Get him drunk enough,</i>
<i>eventually he'll just come out</i>

10:53.444 --> 10:55.154
<i>and admit that he set Jake up.</i>

10:55.237 --> 10:56.364
<i>The plan is flawless.</i>

10:56.447 --> 10:59.075
So there's one flaw with my plan.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.785
O'Sullivan isn't even buzzed,
and you're totally hammered?

11:00.868 --> 11:03.287
I'm so hammered!

11:06.040 --> 11:07.500
Pizza delivery for Jake Peralta.

11:07.583 --> 11:08.584
Oh, that's me.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.919
I didn't order a pizza, though.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.045
Someone must know
I've been having a hard day.

11:11.128 --> 11:13.422
-You've been served.
-What? Come on!

<i>What did you get served?</i>

11:17.009 --> 11:18.469
Oh, you.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.304
I'm being sued for wrongful arrest.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.264
<i>No, I don't care about that.</i>
<i>I'm talking pizza toppings.</i>

11:22.348 --> 11:24.183
<i>The District Court does a great pepperoni.</i>

11:24.266 --> 11:25.726
You know what?
Why are you even talking to me?

11:25.810 --> 11:27.269
Scully's taking a nap.
What are you doing on there?

11:27.353 --> 11:28.771
<i>I miss my old role in the Nine-Nine--</i>

11:32.191 --> 11:33.818
That was never your role. Wait a minute.

11:33.901 --> 11:35.194
This address.

11:35.277 --> 11:36.445
The guy said he lived up by the bus lot

11:36.529 --> 11:37.655
and that's why he was cutting through,

11:37.738 --> 11:39.031
but according to this,

11:39.115 --> 11:40.825
his address isn't anywhere near that lot.

11:40.908 --> 11:42.785
He lied. This is huge.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.370
I got to call Amy and Rosa.

Ow! Rosa! What about the carbs?

12:00.511 --> 12:01.929
That was a misdirection. Carbs never work.

12:02.012 --> 12:04.265
-Slapping's the only way.
-Oh, I think it worked.

12:04.348 --> 12:06.225

-Okay.

12:14.692 --> 12:15.818

No, wait, wait. I have an idea.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.071
Oh, I bet it's great.

Okay, you know how guys like O'Sullivan,
