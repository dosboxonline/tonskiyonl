WEBVTT

00:58.600 --> 01:02.020
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

01:02.104 --> 01:05.232
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.954
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

01:19.037 --> 01:20.372
Coming!

01:20.873 --> 01:23.041
Hang on a second.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.043
Hello?

01:25.127 --> 01:26.211
-Barry?
-Adam?

01:26.295 --> 01:29.882
-Can you believe this is happening?
-I can't. I'll pick you up.

01:32.885 --> 01:34.219
Looking sharp.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.976
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.478
Sorry. I'm excited.

01:42.561 --> 01:45.481
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud ofyou, son.

01:45.564 --> 01:47.983
A perfect report card, all B's.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.318
Very proud.

01:49.401 --> 01:51.487
Ma! I got a thing going here.

01:51.570 --> 01:54.072
-You got lint on your fuzz.
-Ow! That's me!

01:54.156 --> 01:57.826
-Wave to us! We'll be in row 1 18,000.
-Bye!

01:57.910 --> 02:00.287
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

02:22.434 --> 02:23.936
-Hey, Adam.
-Hey, Barry.

02:24.019 --> 02:27.397
-Is that fuzz gel?
-A little. Special day, graduation.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.857
Never thought I'd make it.

02:28.941 --> 02:31.527
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

02:31.610 --> 02:32.694
Those were awkward.

02:32.778 --> 02:36.949
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.784
You did come back different.

02:39.368 --> 02:40.369
Hi, Barry.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.621
Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.374
-Hear about Frankie?
-Yeah.

02:45.457 --> 02:48.168
-You going to the funeral?
-No, I'm not going.

02:48.252 --> 02:50.337
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.923
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.551
I guess he could have
just gotten out ofthe way.

03:03.392 --> 03:06.854
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.314
That's why we don't need vacations.

03:15.070 --> 03:18.824
Boy, quite a bit of pomp,
under the circumstances.

03:22.995 --> 03:25.289
-Well, Adam, today we are men.
-We are!

03:25.372 --> 03:26.665
-Bee-men.
-Amen!

03:26.748 --> 03:28.083
Hallelujah!

03:28.750 --> 03:32.170
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

03:32.254 --> 03:34.840
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

03:35.799 --> 03:40.345
Welcome, New Hive City
graduating class of

03:41.096 --> 03:42.514
9:15.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.809
That concludes our ceremonies.

03:47.436 --> 03:51.565
And begins your career
at Honex lndustries!

03:51.648 --> 03:53.191
Will we pick our job today?

03:53.275 --> 03:55.110
I heard it's just orientation.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.195
Heads up! Here we go.

03:58.739 --> 04:02.326
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

04:11.209 --> 04:14.212
-Wonderwhat it'll be like?
-A little scary.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.634
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

04:18.717 --> 04:21.303
and a part ofthe Hexagon Group.

04:21.386 --> 04:22.846
This is it!

04:25.432 --> 04:26.600
Wow.

04:31.647 --> 04:32.814
Wow.

04:32.898 --> 04:35.984
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked yourwhole life

04:36.068 --> 04:40.155
to get to the point where you
can work for yourwhole life.

04:40.238 --> 04:44.534
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.703
Our top-secret formula

04:46.787 --> 04:50.999
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

04:51.083 --> 04:53.502
into this soothing sweet syrup

04:53.585 --> 04:57.506
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

04:57.756 --> 04:59.925
Honey!

05:02.427 --> 05:04.680
-That girl was hot.
-She's my cousin!

05:04.763 --> 05:06.848
-She is?
-Yes, we're all cousins.

05:06.932 --> 05:10.727
-Right. You're right.
-At Honex, we constantly strive

05:10.811 --> 05:13.939
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

05:14.022 --> 05:17.609
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

05:33.709 --> 05:36.044
-What do you think he makes?
-Not enough.

05:36.128 --> 05:39.798
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.884
-What does that do?
-Catches that little strand of honey

05:42.968 --> 05:46.138
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.934
Can anyone work on the Krelman?

05:51.018 --> 05:54.896
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

05:54.980 --> 05:58.734
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.235
But choose carefully

06:00.318 --> 06:05.323
because you'll stay in the job you pick
for the rest ofyour life.

06:06.658 --> 06:09.911
The same job the rest ofyour life?
I didn't know that.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.705
What's the difference?

06:12.372 --> 06:16.626
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

06:16.710 --> 06:19.212
in 27 million years.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.299
So you'll just work us to death?

06:22.382 --> 06:23.800
We'll sure try.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.613
Wow! That blew my mind!

06:45.906 --> 06:48.450
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?

06:48.533 --> 06:50.035
One job forever?

06:50.118 --> 06:51.828
That's an insane choice
to have to make.

06:51.912 --> 06:55.248
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

06:55.332 --> 06:58.293
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

06:58.376 --> 07:00.921
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

07:01.004 --> 07:03.673
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

07:06.009 --> 07:09.596
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

07:09.679 --> 07:11.556
Like what? Give me one example.

07:15.227 --> 07:17.896
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.361
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.321
Wait a second. Check it out.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.698
-Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
-Wow.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.379
I've never seen them this close.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.422
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.633
Yeah, but some don't come back.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.301
-Hey, Jocks!
-Hi, Jocks!

08:11.449 --> 08:13.410
You guys did great!

08:13.493 --> 08:18.248
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

08:18.331 --> 08:20.542
-I wonderwhere they were.
-I don't know.

08:20.625 --> 08:21.918
Their day's not planned.

08:22.002 --> 08:25.547
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.216
You can'tjust decide
to be a Pollen Jock.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.926
You have to be bred for that.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.344
Right.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.224
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

08:36.308 --> 08:39.394
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

08:39.477 --> 08:45.192
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.278
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins, too?

08:48.361 --> 08:50.030
Distant. Distant.

08:51.114 --> 08:52.282
Look at these two.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.243
-Couple of Hive Harrys.
-Let's have fun with them.

08:55.327 --> 08:57.871
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

08:57.954 --> 09:00.540
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

09:00.624 --> 09:04.669
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

09:04.753 --> 09:07.130
-Oh, my!
-I never thought I'd knock him out.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.090
What were you doing during this?

09:09.174 --> 09:11.051
Trying to alert the authorities.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.677
I can autograph that.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.472
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

09:15.555 --> 09:16.932
Yeah. Gusty.

09:17.015 --> 09:20.435
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.270
-Six miles, huh?
-Barry!

09:22.354 --> 09:25.774
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

09:25.857 --> 09:27.734
-Maybe I am.
-You are not!

09:27.817 --> 09:30.403
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

09:31.863 --> 09:35.200
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

09:35.325 --> 09:39.496
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

09:49.172 --> 09:52.217
-Hey, Honex!
-Dad, you surprised me.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.928
You decide what you're interested in?

09:55.011 --> 09:58.473
-Well, there's a lot of choices.
-But you only get one.

09:59.057 --> 10:01.726
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

10:01.810 --> 10:03.812
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

10:03.895 --> 10:07.732
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

10:07.816 --> 10:11.027
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.571
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

10:13.655 --> 10:16.992
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

10:17.075 --> 10:19.703
You were thinking ofwhat,
making balloon animals?

10:19.786 --> 10:22.330
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

10:22.414 --> 10:25.625
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

10:25.709 --> 10:29.504
-Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
-I'm not trying to be funny.

10:29.587 --> 10:33.341
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

10:33.425 --> 10:36.219
-You're gonna be a stirrer?
-No one's listening to me!

10:36.303 --> 10:37.929
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

10:38.013 --> 10:40.974
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

10:41.057 --> 10:43.310
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

10:43.393 --> 10:46.771
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

10:46.855 --> 10:48.148
Shack up with a grasshopper.

10:48.231 --> 10:50.900
Get a gold tooth
and call everybody "dawg"!

10:50.984 --> 10:52.402
I'm so proud.

10:59.326 --> 11:02.162
-We're starting work today!
-Today's the day.

11:02.245 --> 11:04.247
Come on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.832
Yeah, right.

11:05.915 --> 11:10.837
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

11:10.920 --> 11:13.465
-Is it still available?
-Hang on. Two left!

11:13.548 --> 11:14.883
One ofthem's yours!

11:14.966 --> 11:16.718
Congratulations! Step to the side.

11:17.469 --> 11:20.096
-What'd you get?
-Picking crud out. Stellar!

11:20.180 --> 11:21.222
Wow!

11:21.306 --> 11:22.474
Couple of newbies?

11:22.557 --> 11:24.768
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

11:24.851 --> 11:26.394
Make your choice.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.857
-You want to go first?
-No, you go.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.901
Oh, my. What's available?

11:32.984 --> 11:35.737
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

11:35.820 --> 11:39.532
-Any chance of getting the Krelman?
-Sure, you're on.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.536
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.038
Wax monkey's always open.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.707
The Krelman opened up again.

11:47.832 --> 11:48.833
What happened?

11:49.042 --> 11:52.670
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.589
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

11:54.672 --> 11:58.051
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

11:58.134 --> 12:00.303
Oh, this is so hard!

12:01.179 --> 12:03.598
Heating, cooling, stunt bee,
pourer, stirrer,

12:03.681 --> 12:07.936
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

12:08.019 --> 12:11.398
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

12:11.815 --> 12:13.149
Barry!

12:14.025 --> 12:17.987
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

12:18.071 --> 12:19.656
What happened to you? Where are you?

12:19.739 --> 12:22.033
-I'm going out.
-Out? Out where?

12:22.117 --> 12:23.618
-Out there.
-Oh, no!

12:23.701 --> 12:26.329
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.124
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

12:29.207 --> 12:30.875
Another call coming in.

12:31.543 --> 12:35.755
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

12:35.839 --> 12:38.174
that gets their roses today.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.467
Hey, guys.

12:39.551 --> 12:42.679
-Look at that.
-Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

12:42.762 --> 12:44.973
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

12:45.056 --> 12:47.142
It's okay, Lou.
We're gonna take him up.

12:47.225 --> 12:49.102
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

12:49.853 --> 12:52.647
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.232
-Thank you.
-Okay.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.151
You got a rain advisory today,

12:56.234 --> 13:00.280
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

13:00.363 --> 13:03.158
So be careful.
As always, watch your brooms,

13:03.241 --> 13:06.703
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

13:06.786 --> 13:10.665
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

13:10.748 --> 13:15.420
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

13:15.587 --> 13:18.339
-That's awful.
-And a reminder for you rookies,

13:18.423 --> 13:22.510
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

13:22.594 --> 13:24.762
All right, launch positions!

13:25.930 --> 13:30.768
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

13:31.978 --> 13:33.521
Black and yellow!

13:33.605 --> 13:34.772
Hello!

13:36.316 --> 13:38.109
You ready for this, hot shot?

13:38.193 --> 13:40.111
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

13:40.195 --> 13:41.529
Wind, check.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.615
-Antennae, check.
-Nectar pack, check.

13:43.698 --> 13:46.201
-Wings, check.
-Stinger, check.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.286
Scared out of my shorts, check.

13:48.369 --> 13:51.873
Okay, ladies, let's move it out!

14:01.299 --> 14:05.637
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

14:06.054 --> 14:10.308
All of you, drain those flowers!

14:26.533 --> 14:28.660
Wow! I'm out!

14:29.494 --> 14:31.412
I can't believe I'm out!

14:33.331 --> 14:34.999
So blue.

14:42.173 --> 14:44.509
I feel so fast and free!

14:46.010 --> 14:47.345
Box kite!

14:48.930 --> 14:50.014
Wow!

15:05.363 --> 15:07.448
Flowers!

15:12.620 --> 15:14.789
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.958
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.084
Roses!

15:18.167 --> 15:20.795
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.892
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

15:42.317 --> 15:44.027
That is one nectar collector!

15:45.194 --> 15:47.572
-Ever see pollination up close?
-No, sir.

15:47.655 --> 15:50.658
I pick up some pollen here,
sprinkle it over here.

15:50.742 --> 15:53.494
Maybe a dash over there,
a pinch on that one.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.788
See that? It's a little bit of magic.

15:55.872 --> 15:58.166
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

15:58.249 --> 15:59.751
That's pollen power.

15:59.834 --> 16:03.546
More pollen, more flowers, more nectar,
more honey for us.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.756
Cool.

16:25.902 --> 16:30.239
l'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Could be daisies. Don't we need those?

16:31.074 --> 16:32.367
Copy that visual.

16:32.450 --> 16:35.036
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.622
Say again?
You're reporting a moving flower?

16:37.747 --> 16:39.082
Affirmative.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.177
That was on the line!

16:51.260 --> 16:53.846
This is the coolest. What is it?

16:53.930 --> 16:56.516
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

16:56.599 --> 17:00.687
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.355
Yeah, fuzzy.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.273
Chemical-y.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.526
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.737
My sweet lord of bees!

17:09.821 --> 17:11.823
Candy-brain, get offthere!

17:12.115 --> 17:13.616
Problem!

17:16.327 --> 17:18.454
-Guys!
-This could be bad.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.747
Affirmative.

17:20.123 --> 17:21.457
Very close.

17:22.625 --> 17:23.960
Gonna hurt.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.129
Mama's little boy.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.131
You are way out of position, rookie!

17:31.134 --> 17:33.469
Coming in at you like a missile!

17:36.806 --> 17:39.016
Help me!

17:40.685 --> 17:42.437
I don't think these are flowers.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.897
-Should we tell him?
-I think he knows.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.315
What is this?

17:51.028 --> 17:52.405
Match point!

17:52.488 --> 17:57.493
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

18:06.169 --> 18:07.962
Yowser!

18:36.407 --> 18:37.867
Gross.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.582
There's a bee in the car!

18:46.959 --> 18:48.586
-Do something!
-I'm driving!

18:48.669 --> 18:50.505
-Hi, bee.
-He's back here!

18:50.588 --> 18:52.298
He's going to sting me!

19:00.348 --> 19:04.477
Nobody move. Ifyou don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

19:05.895 --> 19:07.188
He blinked!

19:07.271 --> 19:08.397
Spray him, Granny!

19:08.481 --> 19:09.982
What are you doing?

19:18.074 --> 19:21.410
Wow, the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.080
I gotta get home.

19:33.965 --> 19:36.759
Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.511
Can't fly in rain.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.481
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

19:53.693 --> 19:56.195
Ken, could you close
the window please?

19:56.279 --> 19:59.907
Check out my new rÃ©sumÃ©.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.784
You see? Folds out.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.287
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.791
What was that?

20:08.875 --> 20:12.503
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

20:13.004 --> 20:14.839
Drapes!

20:14.922 --> 20:16.716
That is diabolical.

20:16.799 --> 20:19.969
It's fantastic.
It's got all my special skills,

20:20.052 --> 20:21.721
even my top-ten favorite movies.

20:21.804 --> 20:23.639
What's your number one? Star Wars?

20:23.723 --> 20:25.182
Nah, I don't go for that

20:27.143 --> 20:28.436
kind of stuff.

20:28.519 --> 20:31.355
No wonderwe shouldn't talk to them.
They're out oftheir minds.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.649
When I leave a job interview,
they're flabbergasted,

20:33.733 --> 20:35.776
can't believe what I say.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.821
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

20:39.488 --> 20:42.533
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

20:48.539 --> 20:51.250
I predicted global warming.

20:51.334 --> 20:55.046
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.882
Wait! Stop! Bee!

21:00.009 --> 21:02.887
Stand back. These are winter boots.

21:05.765 --> 21:06.766
Wait!

21:07.183 --> 21:08.351
Don't kill him!

21:08.434 --> 21:11.562
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

21:11.646 --> 21:14.398
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

21:14.857 --> 21:19.946
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

21:20.029 --> 21:22.406
I'm just saying all life has value.

21:22.490 --> 21:25.034
You don't know
what he's capable offeeling.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.537
My brochure!

21:43.052 --> 21:44.971
There you go, little guy.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.602
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

21:51.686 --> 21:54.146
Put that on your rÃ©sumÃ© brochure.

21:54.230 --> 21:56.148
My whole face could puff up.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.192
Make it one ofyour special skills.

21:58.275 --> 22:01.237
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.325
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

22:06.409 --> 22:09.996
-Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
-Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.206
-You could put carob chips on there.
-Bye.

22:12.289 --> 22:14.583
-Supposed to be less calories.
-Bye.

22:21.215 --> 22:23.050
I gotta say something.

22:23.134 --> 22:26.303
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

22:27.805 --> 22:29.390
All right, here it goes.

22:41.277 --> 22:42.445
Nah.

22:49.326 --> 22:51.162
What would I say?

22:53.456 --> 22:55.624
I could really get in trouble.

22:57.543 --> 23:01.047
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.965
I can't believe I'm doing this.

23:03.466 --> 23:04.925
I've got to.

23:05.009 --> 23:07.303
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!

23:08.471 --> 23:10.264
No. Yes. No.

23:10.347 --> 23:12.349
Do it. I can't.

23:12.808 --> 23:17.146
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.732
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

23:20.566 --> 23:21.901
Hi!

23:21.984 --> 23:23.652
I'm sorry.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.821
-You're talking.
-Yes, I know.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.406
You're talking!

23:27.490 --> 23:28.783
I'm so sorry.

23:28.866 --> 23:32.119
No, it's okay. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

23:32.203 --> 23:34.288
But I don't recall going to bed.

23:34.371 --> 23:37.458
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

23:37.541 --> 23:42.296
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

23:42.379 --> 23:45.633
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,

23:45.716 --> 23:48.094
but they were all trying to kill me.

23:48.177 --> 23:50.471
And if it wasn't for you...

23:50.554 --> 23:53.057
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

23:55.726 --> 23:57.228
That was a little weird.

23:57.311 --> 23:59.355
-I'm talking with a bee.
-Yeah.

23:59.438 --> 24:03.150
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

24:03.234 --> 24:06.028
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

24:06.112 --> 24:09.532
-Wait! How did you learn to do that?
-What?

24:09.615 --> 24:11.951
The talking thing.

24:12.034 --> 24:16.038
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.790
-That's very funny.
-Yeah.

24:17.873 --> 24:22.169
Bees are funny. Ifwe didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

24:22.253 --> 24:23.295
Anyway...

24:23.379 --> 24:27.174
-Can I get you something?
-Like what?

24:27.258 --> 24:31.387
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Coffee?

24:31.470 --> 24:33.764
I don't want to put you out.

24:33.848 --> 24:36.350
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

24:36.433 --> 24:38.519
-It's just coffee.
-I hate to impose.

24:38.602 --> 24:41.397
-Don't be ridiculous!
-Actually, I would love a cup.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.023
Hey, you want rum cake?

24:43.107 --> 24:44.525
-I shouldn't.
-Have some.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.652
-No, I can't.
-Come on!

24:46.735 --> 24:48.904
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.031
-Where?
-These stripes don't help.

24:51.115 --> 24:52.199
You look great!

24:52.283 --> 24:55.202
I don't know ifyou know
anything about fashion.

24:55.286 --> 24:56.704
Are you all right?

24:56.787 --> 24:58.122
No.

25:00.541 --> 25:03.961
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.963
He finally gets there.

25:06.046 --> 25:09.717
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

25:09.800 --> 25:13.888
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

25:13.971 --> 25:16.182
"Why would I marry a watermelon?"

25:21.979 --> 25:24.565
Is that a bee joke?

25:24.648 --> 25:26.192
That's the kind of stuffwe do.

25:26.275 --> 25:28.319
Yeah, different.

25:28.402 --> 25:31.322
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

25:31.405 --> 25:33.449
About work? I don't know.

25:33.532 --> 25:37.912
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

25:37.995 --> 25:39.705
I know how you feel.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.415
-You do?
-Sure.

25:41.498 --> 25:45.878
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer
or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.756
-Really?
-My only interest is flowers.

25:48.839 --> 25:52.509
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

25:53.510 --> 25:56.096
Anyway, ifyou look...

25:56.180 --> 25:58.933
There's my hive right there. See it?

25:59.016 --> 26:00.684
You're in Sheep Meadow!

26:00.768 --> 26:03.520
Yes! I'm right offthe Turtle Pond!

26:03.604 --> 26:08.442
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

26:08.525 --> 26:11.153
-Why do girls put rings on their toes?
-Why not?

26:11.237 --> 26:14.698
-It's like putting a hat on your knee.
-Maybe I'll try that.

26:14.782 --> 26:18.118
-You all right, ma'am?
-Oh, yeah. Fine.

26:18.202 --> 26:20.579
Just having two cups of coffee!

26:33.759 --> 26:36.679
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

26:36.762 --> 26:38.055
Yeah, it's no trouble.

26:38.138 --> 26:41.976
Sorry I couldn't finish it.
If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.

26:42.518 --> 26:43.727
Are you...

26:45.562 --> 26:47.606
Can I take a piece ofthis with me?

26:47.690 --> 26:50.234
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.362
-Thanks!
-Yeah.

26:55.030 --> 26:58.242
All right. Well, then,
I guess I'll see you around.

26:58.325 --> 26:59.827
Or not.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.662
Okay, Barry.

27:01.745 --> 27:04.707
And thank you
so much again, for before.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.750
Oh, that? That was nothing.

27:06.834 --> 27:09.586
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

27:30.858 --> 27:32.609
This can't possibly work.

27:32.693 --> 27:35.279
He's all set to go. We may as well try it.

27:35.362 --> 27:37.614
Okay, Dave, pull the chute.

27:41.035 --> 27:42.870
-Sounds amazing.
-It was amazing!

27:42.953 --> 27:45.789
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

27:45.873 --> 27:48.542
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

27:48.625 --> 27:51.211
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

27:51.295 --> 27:53.464
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

27:53.547 --> 27:56.300
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

27:56.383 --> 28:00.220
-Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
-Some of them. But some of them don't.

28:00.304 --> 28:01.847
-How'd you get back?
-Poodle.

28:01.930 --> 28:05.601
You did it, and I'm glad.
You saw whatever you wanted to see.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.394
You had your "experience."

28:07.478 --> 28:10.564
Now you can pick out your job
and be normal.

28:10.647 --> 28:12.316
-Well...
-Well?

28:12.399 --> 28:13.567
Well, I met someone.

28:13.650 --> 28:16.320
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

28:16.403 --> 28:19.615
-A wasp? Your parents will kill you!
-No, no, no, not a wasp.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.825
-Spider?
-I'm not attracted to spiders.

28:21.909 --> 28:24.828
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

28:24.912 --> 28:27.081
I can't get by that face.

28:27.164 --> 28:29.208
So who is she?

28:29.291 --> 28:31.877
She's human.

28:31.960 --> 28:36.423
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.

28:36.507 --> 28:38.425
-Her name's Vanessa.
-Oh, boy.

28:38.509 --> 28:41.303
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

28:41.387 --> 28:44.139
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

28:44.223 --> 28:45.474
We're not dating.

28:45.557 --> 28:49.895
You're flying outside the hive,
talking to humans that attack our homes

28:49.978 --> 28:53.982
with powerwashers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

28:54.066 --> 28:57.778
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

28:57.861 --> 28:58.987
This is over!

28:59.071 --> 29:00.614
Eat this.

29:00.864 --> 29:03.033
This is not over! What was that?

29:03.117 --> 29:05.911
-They call it a crumb.
-It was so stingin' stripey!

29:05.994 --> 29:09.456
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls offwhat they eat!

29:09.540 --> 29:11.458
-You know what a Cinnabon is?
-No.

29:11.542 --> 29:14.920
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

29:15.003 --> 29:16.046
Sit down!

29:16.130 --> 29:17.840
-...really hot!
-Listen to me!

29:17.923 --> 29:21.969
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

29:22.219 --> 29:25.472
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

29:25.556 --> 29:28.308
There's no yearning. Stop yearning.
Listen to me!

29:28.392 --> 29:32.646
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!

29:32.729 --> 29:34.481
-Thinking bee.
-Thinking bee.

29:34.565 --> 29:38.944
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

29:40.571 --> 29:42.906
There he is. He's in the pool.

29:42.990 --> 29:45.159
You know what your problem is, Barry?

29:45.242 --> 29:46.827
I gotta start thinking bee?

29:46.910 --> 29:48.996
How much longerwill this go on?

29:49.079 --> 29:52.499
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?

29:52.583 --> 29:55.169
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.

29:55.252 --> 29:59.465
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!

29:59.548 --> 30:02.176
Would it kill you to make a little honey?

30:02.259 --> 30:04.887
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.847
Martin, would you talk to him?

30:06.930 --> 30:08.599
Barry, I'm talking to you!

30:15.439 --> 30:16.773
Sugar

30:18.358 --> 30:20.027
Ah, honey, honey

30:22.279 --> 30:25.824
You are my candy, girl

30:25.908 --> 30:29.286
And you got me wanting you

30:31.288 --> 30:32.623
Honey

30:34.124 --> 30:36.293
Ah, sugar, sugar

30:36.793 --> 30:38.504
You coming?

30:38.587 --> 30:40.422
Got everything?

30:40.631 --> 30:42.341
All set!

30:42.424 --> 30:43.884
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

30:43.967 --> 30:45.552
Don't be too long.

30:46.887 --> 30:50.891
l just can't believe the loveliness
of loving you

30:50.974 --> 30:54.228
l just can't believe it's true

30:54.811 --> 30:58.565
l just can't believe the wonder
of this feeling, too

30:58.649 --> 31:00.067
l just can't believe it's true

31:00.150 --> 31:02.319
Watch this!

31:02.402 --> 31:03.862
Sugar

31:05.322 --> 31:07.366
Ah, honey, honey

31:13.205 --> 31:14.873
Vanessa!

31:18.168 --> 31:21.129
-We're still here.
-I told you not to yell at him.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.923
He doesn't respond to yelling!

31:23.006 --> 31:25.259
-Then why yell at me?
-Because you don't listen!

31:25.342 --> 31:26.843
I'm not listening to this.

31:26.927 --> 31:28.262
Sorry, I've gotta go.

31:28.345 --> 31:30.722
-Where are you going?
-I'm meeting a friend.

31:30.806 --> 31:33.433
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

31:33.517 --> 31:34.601
Bye.

31:34.685 --> 31:36.979
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

31:40.857 --> 31:44.319
They have a huge parade
offlowers every year in Pasadena?

31:44.695 --> 31:49.116
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

31:49.199 --> 31:53.620
Up on a float, surrounded by flowers,
crowds cheering.

31:53.704 --> 31:57.124
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

31:57.541 --> 32:01.962
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

32:02.045 --> 32:05.299
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

32:05.382 --> 32:08.135
Yeah, okay, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

32:08.218 --> 32:11.638
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

32:11.722 --> 32:13.307
You don't have that?

32:13.390 --> 32:17.311
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

32:17.394 --> 32:18.729
Oh, my.

32:19.479 --> 32:20.814
Dumb bees!

32:20.897 --> 32:24.067
You must want to sting all those jerks.

32:24.151 --> 32:27.237
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

32:27.529 --> 32:29.948
So you have to watch your temper.

32:30.032 --> 32:33.327
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

32:33.410 --> 32:37.331
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

32:37.414 --> 32:40.042
Anger, jealousy, lust.

32:41.918 --> 32:44.296
Oh, my goodness! Are you okay?

32:44.379 --> 32:45.589
Yeah.

32:45.672 --> 32:47.966
-What is wrong with you?
-It's a bug.

32:48.050 --> 32:52.346
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!

32:52.429 --> 32:54.598
What was that? A Pick 'n Save circular?

32:54.681 --> 32:57.017
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

32:57.100 --> 33:00.979
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

33:01.063 --> 33:03.065
You've really got that
down to a science.

33:03.148 --> 33:06.151
-I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
-I'll bet.

33:06.443 --> 33:09.488
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

33:09.988 --> 33:13.533
How did this get here?
Cute Bee, Golden Blossom,

33:13.742 --> 33:15.786
Ray Liotta Private Select?

33:17.120 --> 33:19.247
-Is he that actor?
-I never heard of him.

33:19.331 --> 33:22.167
-Why is this here?
-For people. We eat it.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.378
You don't have
enough food ofyour own?

33:24.461 --> 33:27.047
-Well, yes.
-How do you get it?

33:27.130 --> 33:29.966
-Bees make it.
-I know who makes it!

33:30.050 --> 33:31.885
And it's hard to make it!

33:31.968 --> 33:35.722
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

33:35.806 --> 33:38.016
-It's organic.
-It's our-ganic!

33:38.100 --> 33:39.393
It's just honey, Barry.

33:39.476 --> 33:41.061
Just what?

33:41.144 --> 33:44.898
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

33:44.981 --> 33:49.152
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

33:49.736 --> 33:52.739
And it's on sale?
I'm getting to the bottom ofthis.

33:52.823 --> 33:54.700
I'm getting to the bottom of all ofthis!

34:01.790 --> 34:03.291
Hey, Hector.

34:05.585 --> 34:07.921
-You almost done?
-Almost.

34:09.965 --> 34:12.175
He is here. I sense it.

34:21.351 --> 34:23.228
Well, I guess I'll go home now

34:23.311 --> 34:27.691
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

34:27.774 --> 34:29.609
You're busted, box boy!

34:30.485 --> 34:33.113
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

34:33.196 --> 34:36.074
I can talk. And now you'll start talking!

34:36.158 --> 34:39.244
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

34:39.327 --> 34:41.913
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

34:41.997 --> 34:44.791
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!

34:45.375 --> 34:47.919
You're too late! It's ours now!

34:48.003 --> 34:50.422
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

34:50.505 --> 34:53.800
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!

34:53.884 --> 34:56.011
Where is the honey coming from?

34:57.846 --> 34:59.389
Tell me where!

34:59.473 --> 35:02.017
Honey Farms!
It comes from Honey Farms!

35:25.749 --> 35:26.833
Crazy person!

36:02.494 --> 36:05.163
What horrible thing has happened here?

36:05.247 --> 36:08.041
These faces,
they never knew what hit them.

36:08.124 --> 36:10.877
And now they're on the road to nowhere!

36:11.795 --> 36:13.213
Just keep still.

36:13.296 --> 36:15.632
-What? You're not dead?
-Do I look dead?

36:15.715 --> 36:18.885
They will wipe anything that moves.
Where you headed?

36:18.969 --> 36:21.930
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

36:22.013 --> 36:26.685
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

36:26.768 --> 36:28.520
I'm going to Tacoma.

36:28.603 --> 36:30.689
-And you?
-He really is dead.

36:30.772 --> 36:32.023
All right.

36:32.107 --> 36:33.233
Uh-oh!

36:33.316 --> 36:35.318
-What is that?
-Oh, no!

36:35.402 --> 36:37.404
-A wiper! Triple blade!
-Triple blade?

36:37.487 --> 36:40.115
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

36:40.198 --> 36:44.452
Why does everything
have to be so doggone clean?

36:44.536 --> 36:46.705
How much do you people need to see?

36:46.788 --> 36:49.833
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!

36:49.916 --> 36:53.086
From NPR News in Washington,
l'm Carl Kasell.

36:53.169 --> 36:55.755
But don't kill no more bugs!

36:57.924 --> 37:00.844
-Bee!
-Moose blood guy!

37:09.561 --> 37:11.146
-You hear something?
-Like what?

37:11.229 --> 37:12.939
Like tiny screaming.

37:13.023 --> 37:14.357
Turn off the radio.

37:26.119 --> 37:28.121
Whassup, bee boy?

37:28.204 --> 37:29.956
Hey, Blood.

37:30.040 --> 37:33.209
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.

37:33.293 --> 37:34.461
Wow!

37:34.544 --> 37:38.214
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.

37:38.298 --> 37:39.716
I mean, that honey's ours.

37:39.799 --> 37:42.510
-Bees hang tight.
-We're all jammed in.

37:42.594 --> 37:43.762
It's a close community.

37:43.845 --> 37:47.807
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

37:47.891 --> 37:51.394
-What ifyou get in trouble?
-You a mosquito, you in trouble.

37:51.478 --> 37:54.898
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!

37:54.981 --> 37:57.943
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.

37:58.026 --> 38:02.280
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

38:02.364 --> 38:04.491
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

38:05.867 --> 38:07.911
You got to be kidding me!

38:07.994 --> 38:11.581
Mooseblood's about
to leave the building! So long, bee!

38:11.998 --> 38:13.667
-Hey, guys!
-Mooseblood!

38:13.750 --> 38:17.837
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?

38:34.396 --> 38:38.483
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.

38:38.566 --> 38:40.068
What is this place?

38:40.151 --> 38:42.445
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.

38:42.529 --> 38:44.030
They are pinheads!

38:45.407 --> 38:46.741
Pinhead.

38:47.409 --> 38:50.912
-Check out the new smoker.
-Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.580
The Thomas 3000!

38:52.664 --> 38:53.707
Smoker?

38:53.790 --> 38:58.211
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

39:00.046 --> 39:03.133
A couple breaths ofthis
knocks them right out.

39:05.927 --> 39:08.722
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

39:08.805 --> 39:11.349
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

39:31.870 --> 39:33.371
Oh, my!

39:36.332 --> 39:38.501
What's going on? Are you okay?

39:38.585 --> 39:40.587
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

39:40.670 --> 39:44.257
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?

39:44.340 --> 39:47.010
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.

39:47.385 --> 39:50.764
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!

39:50.847 --> 39:52.557
That's a drag queen!

39:57.312 --> 39:59.147
What is this?

40:08.073 --> 40:10.533
Oh, no! There's hundreds ofthem!

40:21.336 --> 40:22.629
Bee honey.

40:22.712 --> 40:27.092
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!

40:27.509 --> 40:30.136
This is worse than anything
bears have done!

40:30.220 --> 40:31.679
I intend to do something.

40:31.763 --> 40:32.847
Oh, Barry, stop.

40:32.931 --> 40:36.267
Who told you humans
are taking our honey? That's a rumor.

40:36.351 --> 40:38.103
Do these look like rumors?

40:38.186 --> 40:41.815
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.

40:41.898 --> 40:44.109
How did you get mixed up in this?

40:44.192 --> 40:45.693
He's been talking to humans.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.487
-What?
-Talking to humans?

40:47.570 --> 40:50.448
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!

40:50.532 --> 40:52.033
Make out? Barry!

40:52.117 --> 40:53.284
We do not.

40:53.368 --> 40:55.537
-You wish you could.
-Whose side are you on?

40:55.620 --> 40:56.830
The bees!

40:56.913 --> 41:01.709
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

41:01.793 --> 41:04.504
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?

41:04.587 --> 41:08.341
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!

41:08.424 --> 41:10.885
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked

41:10.969 --> 41:14.013
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.

41:14.097 --> 41:15.640
I remember that.

41:15.723 --> 41:19.519
What right do they have to our honey?
We live on two cups a year.

41:19.602 --> 41:22.313
They put it in lip balm
for no reason whatsoever!

41:22.397 --> 41:24.983
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?

41:25.066 --> 41:26.818
Sting them where it really hurts.

41:26.901 --> 41:28.153
In the face! The eye!

41:28.236 --> 41:29.445
-That would hurt.
-No.

41:29.529 --> 41:31.239
Up the nose? That's a killer.

41:31.322 --> 41:35.451
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.

41:36.286 --> 41:40.874
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.

41:45.712 --> 41:47.297
No more bee beards!

41:49.757 --> 41:52.177
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.

41:52.260 --> 41:54.095
Weatherwith Storm Stinger.

41:54.179 --> 41:55.680
Sports with Buzz Larvi.

41:55.763 --> 41:57.765
And Jeanette Chung.

41:59.934 --> 42:02.687
-Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
-And I'm Jeanette Chung.

42:02.770 --> 42:05.523
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,

42:05.607 --> 42:09.277
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,

42:09.360 --> 42:12.113
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

42:14.908 --> 42:17.410
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,

42:17.493 --> 42:22.749
we'll have three former queens here
in our studio, discussing their new book,

42:22.832 --> 42:25.877
Classy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.087
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

42:28.171 --> 42:31.591
Did you ever think,
"I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this"?

42:31.674 --> 42:34.135
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.

42:34.219 --> 42:37.388
What about Bee Columbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

42:37.472 --> 42:40.225
Where I'm from,
we'd never sue humans.

42:40.308 --> 42:43.394
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.

42:43.478 --> 42:44.812
How old are you?

42:44.896 --> 42:48.233
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,

42:48.316 --> 42:51.069
which will be the trial
ofthe bee century.

42:51.152 --> 42:54.239
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world, too.

42:54.322 --> 42:56.658
It's a common name. Next week...

42:56.991 --> 43:01.621
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...

43:01.704 --> 43:03.248
Next week...

43:03.331 --> 43:07.627
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard them.

43:07.710 --> 43:11.756
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.

43:11.839 --> 43:16.803
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

43:18.513 --> 43:23.017
In tennis, you attack
at the point ofweakness!

43:23.101 --> 43:26.938
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81 .

43:27.021 --> 43:30.817
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage ofthat?

43:30.900 --> 43:33.987
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.

43:34.070 --> 43:36.781
-Is that that same bee?
-Yes, it is!

43:36.864 --> 43:39.534
I'm helping him sue the human race.

43:40.576 --> 43:42.829
-Hello.
-Hello, bee.

43:42.912 --> 43:44.122
This is Ken.

43:44.205 --> 43:47.375
Yeah, I remember you.
Timberland, size ten and a half.

43:47.458 --> 43:49.836
Vibram sole, I believe.

43:49.919 --> 43:51.838
Why does he talk again?

43:51.921 --> 43:54.799
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.

43:54.882 --> 43:56.968
But it's our yogurt night!

43:57.051 --> 43:58.594
Bye-bye.

43:59.220 --> 44:02.140
Why is yogurt night so difficult?

44:03.224 --> 44:06.853
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!

44:06.936 --> 44:09.188
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.

44:10.398 --> 44:12.650
-Frosting...
-How many sugars?

44:12.734 --> 44:14.944
Just one.
I try not to use the competition.

44:16.404 --> 44:18.281
So why are you helping me?

44:18.614 --> 44:20.742
Bees have good qualities.

44:22.160 --> 44:24.329
And it takes my mind offthe shop.

44:25.246 --> 44:28.624
Instead offlowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.

44:28.708 --> 44:31.002
Those are great, ifyou're three.

44:31.085 --> 44:32.628
And artificial flowers.

44:32.712 --> 44:36.674
-Oh, those just get me psychotic!
-Yeah, me, too.

44:36.758 --> 44:39.135
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

44:39.218 --> 44:41.346
Bees must hate those fake things!

44:41.429 --> 44:43.973
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.

44:44.057 --> 44:47.226
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.

44:47.310 --> 44:50.229
-This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
-I guess.

44:50.313 --> 44:52.523
You sure you want to go through with it?

44:52.607 --> 44:55.485
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able to say,

44:55.568 --> 44:58.279
"Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

45:01.449 --> 45:04.410
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

45:04.494 --> 45:09.040
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,

45:09.123 --> 45:13.378
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.

45:17.965 --> 45:19.300
What have we gotten into here, Barry?

45:21.344 --> 45:22.470
It's pretty big, isn't it?

45:22.553 --> 45:25.598
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.

45:25.681 --> 45:29.811
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?

45:30.645 --> 45:33.648
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.

45:45.368 --> 45:48.704
-What's the matter?
-I don't know, I just got a chill.

45:55.044 --> 45:57.922
Well, if it isn't the bee team.

45:58.005 --> 46:00.133
You boys work on this?

46:02.927 --> 46:06.597
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.

46:06.681 --> 46:11.102
All right. Case number 4475,
Superior Court of New York,

46:11.185 --> 46:13.771
Barry Bee Benson
versus the Honey lndustry

46:13.855 --> 46:15.773
is now in session.

46:15.857 --> 46:20.445
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?

46:20.528 --> 46:22.113
A privilege.

46:22.196 --> 46:27.535
Mr. Benson, you're representing
all the bees of the world?

46:38.379 --> 46:41.632
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.

46:43.176 --> 46:46.804
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.

46:49.557 --> 46:52.143
Ladies and gentlemen ofthe jury,

46:52.226 --> 46:55.313
my grandmotherwas a simple woman.

46:55.396 --> 46:59.066
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right

46:59.150 --> 47:04.363
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.

47:04.447 --> 47:08.326
Ifwe lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,

47:08.409 --> 47:10.203
just think ofwhat would it mean.

47:10.286 --> 47:13.664
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

47:13.748 --> 47:17.043
for the elastic in my britches!

47:17.126 --> 47:19.003
Talking bee!

47:19.086 --> 47:21.547
How do we know this isn't some sort of

47:21.631 --> 47:25.301
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

47:25.384 --> 47:28.221
They could be using laser beams!

47:28.304 --> 47:31.390
Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning!

47:31.474 --> 47:35.144
For all we know,
he could be on steroids!

47:37.480 --> 47:39.190
Mr. Benson?

47:44.946 --> 47:47.073
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.

47:47.156 --> 47:51.285
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.

47:51.619 --> 47:54.372
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!

47:54.455 --> 47:57.375
We make it.
And we protect it with our lives.

47:57.458 --> 47:59.835
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room

47:59.919 --> 48:03.589
who think they can take it from us
'cause we're the little guys!

48:03.673 --> 48:06.425
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

48:06.509 --> 48:10.888
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have,

48:10.972 --> 48:12.807
but everything we are!

48:16.352 --> 48:19.522
I wish he'd dress like that all the time.
So nice!

48:19.605 --> 48:21.315
Call your first witness.

48:21.399 --> 48:24.443
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms,

48:24.527 --> 48:27.530
-big company you have.
-I suppose so.

48:27.655 --> 48:31.200
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!

48:31.534 --> 48:34.287
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.

48:34.370 --> 48:37.915
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.

48:37.999 --> 48:41.919
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?

48:42.003 --> 48:43.921
-No.
-I couldn't hear you.

48:44.005 --> 48:45.464
-No.
-No.

48:45.548 --> 48:49.302
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,

48:49.385 --> 48:54.181
it seems you thought a bearwould be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

48:54.265 --> 48:56.601
They're very lovable creatures.

48:56.684 --> 49:00.187
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

49:00.271 --> 49:01.606
You mean like this?

49:05.359 --> 49:07.194
Bears kill bees!

49:07.862 --> 49:10.948
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?

49:11.032 --> 49:14.076
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!

49:15.286 --> 49:17.955
Okay, that's enough. Take him away.

49:23.586 --> 49:28.007
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.

49:28.090 --> 49:31.177
-Where have I heard it before?
-I was with a band called The Police.

49:31.260 --> 49:33.971
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?

49:34.055 --> 49:36.349
-No, I haven't.
-No, you haven't.

49:36.432 --> 49:38.893
And so here we have
yet another example

49:38.976 --> 49:41.729
of bee culture casually stolen
by a human

49:41.812 --> 49:44.231
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.

49:44.315 --> 49:45.483
Oh, please.

49:45.566 --> 49:47.693
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

49:47.777 --> 49:50.655
Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting.

49:50.738 --> 49:55.034
Or should I say, Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

49:56.702 --> 49:59.455
That's not his real name? You idiots!

50:00.373 --> 50:04.001
Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations
on your Emmy win

50:04.085 --> 50:06.962
for a guest spot on ER in 2005.

50:07.046 --> 50:08.923
Thank you. Thank you.

50:09.590 --> 50:12.718
I see from your rÃ©sumÃ©
that you're devilishly handsome

50:12.802 --> 50:16.013
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.

50:16.305 --> 50:18.849
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

50:19.100 --> 50:22.103
Not yet it isn't.
But is this what it's come to for you?

50:22.186 --> 50:24.188
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees

50:24.271 --> 50:28.693
so you don't have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?

50:28.776 --> 50:31.278
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!

50:31.362 --> 50:34.490
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!

50:35.658 --> 50:39.203
Why doesn't someone just step
on this creep, and we can all go home?

50:39.286 --> 50:41.956
-Order in this court!
-You're all thinking it!

50:42.039 --> 50:43.541
Order! Order, I say!

50:43.624 --> 50:45.960
-Say it!
-Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

50:51.507 --> 50:54.760
I think it was awfully nice
ofthat bear to pitch in like that.

50:54.844 --> 50:57.138
I think the jury's on our side.

50:57.972 --> 51:00.516
Are we doing everything right, legally?

51:00.599 --> 51:01.767
I'm a florist.

51:01.851 --> 51:05.396
Right. Well, here's to a great team.

51:05.479 --> 51:06.814
To a great team!

51:08.691 --> 51:10.443
Well, hello.

51:10.526 --> 51:12.445
-Ken!
-Hello.

51:12.528 --> 51:14.447
I didn't think you were coming.

51:14.530 --> 51:19.285
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... The battery.

51:19.827 --> 51:24.206
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

51:24.832 --> 51:26.876
Oh, that was lucky.

51:28.586 --> 51:32.089
There's a little left. I could heat it up.

51:32.173 --> 51:34.467
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

51:38.679 --> 51:41.348
So, I hear you're quite a tennis player.

51:41.432 --> 51:44.935
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.

51:47.188 --> 51:50.900
That's where I usually sit. Right there.

51:52.610 --> 51:56.781
Ken, Barry was looking at your rÃ©sumÃ©,
and he agreed with me

51:56.864 --> 52:01.118
that eating with chopsticks
isn't really a special skill.

52:01.202 --> 52:04.205
You think I don't see what you're doing?

52:04.288 --> 52:07.958
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.

52:08.709 --> 52:10.085
Do we?

52:10.169 --> 52:14.673
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

52:14.757 --> 52:17.468
That's just what I was thinking
about doing.

52:17.551 --> 52:22.556
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

52:26.811 --> 52:28.896
I'm going to drain the old stinger.

52:28.979 --> 52:30.731
Yeah, you do that.

52:34.151 --> 52:35.820
Look at that.

52:44.578 --> 52:50.835
You know, I've just about had it
with your little mind games.

52:51.126 --> 52:53.420
-What's that?
-Italian Vogue.

52:53.504 --> 52:55.172
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

52:55.256 --> 52:56.590
A lot of ads.

52:56.674 --> 52:58.008
Rememberwhat Van said,

52:58.092 --> 53:00.261
why is your life
more valuable than mine?

53:00.344 --> 53:03.472
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

53:04.598 --> 53:07.434
I think something stinks in here!

53:07.518 --> 53:09.019
I love the smell of flowers.

53:09.103 --> 53:12.189
How do you like the smell offlames?

53:12.273 --> 53:13.315
Not as much.

53:29.206 --> 53:30.958
Water bug! Not taking sides!

53:33.002 --> 53:36.463
Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

53:36.547 --> 53:38.257
I've got issues!

53:42.803 --> 53:45.806
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

53:45.890 --> 53:47.892
-You're bluffing.
-Am I?

53:58.652 --> 54:00.154
Surf's up, dude!

54:00.237 --> 54:01.488
Poo water!

54:04.909 --> 54:06.577
That bowl is gnarly.

54:06.660 --> 54:10.080
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

54:10.164 --> 54:12.583
Kenneth! What are you doing?

54:12.666 --> 54:16.086
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!

54:16.170 --> 54:18.172
We need to talk!

54:18.255 --> 54:20.090
He's just a little bee!

54:20.174 --> 54:25.095
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

54:25.179 --> 54:30.225
Long time? What are you talking about?
Are there other bugs in your life?

54:30.309 --> 54:33.646
No, but there are other things
bugging me in life.

54:33.729 --> 54:35.439
And you're one ofthem!

54:35.522 --> 54:38.651
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...

54:38.734 --> 54:42.863
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!

54:42.947 --> 54:44.698
Goodbye, Ken.

54:48.369 --> 54:50.120
And for your information,

54:50.204 --> 54:55.292
I prefer sugar-free,
artificial sweeteners made by man!

54:56.377 --> 54:58.796
I'm sorry about all that.

54:58.879 --> 55:02.549
I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!

55:04.385 --> 55:07.513
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.

55:07.596 --> 55:10.224
I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well.

55:10.307 --> 55:12.142
Are you okay for the trial?

55:12.226 --> 55:15.688
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.

55:15.771 --> 55:19.733
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

55:19.817 --> 55:21.151
Good idea!

55:21.235 --> 55:24.530
You can really see why he's considered
one ofthe best lawyers...

55:24.613 --> 55:25.280
Yeah.

55:28.117 --> 55:30.452
Layton, you've gotta weave some magic
with this jury,

55:30.536 --> 55:32.496
or it's gonna be all over.

55:32.579 --> 55:36.917
Don't worry. The only thing I have to do
to turn this jury around

55:37.001 --> 55:40.713
is to remind them
ofwhat they don't like about bees.

55:40.796 --> 55:43.257
-You got the tweezers?
-Are you allergic?

55:43.340 --> 55:46.176
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

55:46.260 --> 55:51.015
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.

55:51.098 --> 55:56.311
What exactly is your relationship
to that woman?

55:57.938 --> 55:58.897
We're friends.

55:58.981 --> 56:00.274
-Good friends?
-Yes.

56:00.357 --> 56:03.527
How good? Do you live together?

56:03.610 --> 56:05.070
Wait a minute...

56:05.154 --> 56:06.780
Are you her little

56:07.281 --> 56:08.866
bedbug?

56:09.324 --> 56:12.911
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,

56:12.995 --> 56:16.790
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?

56:16.874 --> 56:19.918
-Yeah, but...
-So those aren't your real parents!

56:20.002 --> 56:21.754
-Oh, Barry...
-Yes, they are!

56:21.837 --> 56:23.088
Hold me back!

56:23.172 --> 56:26.175
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?

56:26.258 --> 56:27.634
He's denouncing bees!

56:27.718 --> 56:30.304
Don't y'all date your cousins?

56:30.387 --> 56:33.140
-Objection!
-I'm going to pincushion this guy!

56:36.477 --> 56:38.145
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

56:43.317 --> 56:45.569
Oh, I'm hit!

56:45.652 --> 56:47.738
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

56:47.821 --> 56:49.448
Order! Order!

56:49.531 --> 56:52.743
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!

56:52.826 --> 56:56.789
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!

56:56.872 --> 56:59.333
You see?
You can't treat them like equals!

56:59.416 --> 57:01.335
They're striped savages!

57:01.418 --> 57:06.006
Stinging's the only thing they know!
It's theirway!

57:06.381 --> 57:09.134
-Adam, stay with me.
-I can't feel my legs.

57:10.344 --> 57:14.223
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison

57:14.306 --> 57:16.100
from my heaving buttocks?

57:16.767 --> 57:19.937
I will have order in my court. Order!

57:20.020 --> 57:21.522
Order, please!

57:23.524 --> 57:26.318
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race

57:26.401 --> 57:28.904
took a pointed turn
against the bees yesterday

57:28.987 --> 57:32.825
when one of their legal team
stung Layton T. Montgomery.

57:47.548 --> 57:49.508
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

57:49.591 --> 57:51.343
-Is there much pain?
-Yeah.

57:53.887 --> 57:55.180
I...

57:56.014 --> 57:58.559
-I blew the whole case, didn't I?
-It doesn't matter.

57:58.642 --> 58:01.478
What matters is you're alive.
You could have died.

58:01.562 --> 58:04.314
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

58:04.398 --> 58:09.319
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

58:09.403 --> 58:12.239
Look, there's a little celery still on it.

58:13.073 --> 58:14.867
What was it like to sting someone?

58:14.950 --> 58:17.327
I can't explain it. It was all...

58:17.411 --> 58:20.914
All adrenaline and then...
And then ecstasy!

58:23.792 --> 58:25.210
All right.

58:25.294 --> 58:27.337
You think it was all a trap?

58:27.421 --> 58:30.632
Of course.
I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.

58:30.716 --> 58:32.634
What were we thinking? Look at us.

58:32.718 --> 58:35.095
We're just a couple of bugs
in this world.

58:35.179 --> 58:37.514
What will the humans do to us
ifthey win?

58:37.598 --> 58:38.849
I don't know.

58:38.932 --> 58:42.352
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.

58:42.436 --> 58:46.023
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!

58:46.106 --> 58:47.441
Oh, my.

58:49.985 --> 58:52.529
Could you get a nurse
to close that window?

58:52.613 --> 58:54.573
-Why?
-The smoke.

58:54.656 --> 58:56.283
Bees don't smoke.

58:56.909 --> 58:59.328
Right. Bees don't smoke.

59:00.454 --> 59:04.208
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.

59:04.291 --> 59:06.585
That's it! That's our case!

59:06.668 --> 59:08.503
It is? It's not over?

59:08.587 --> 59:10.547
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

59:10.631 --> 59:13.634
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.

59:16.303 --> 59:19.723
And assuming you've done
step 29 correctly,

59:19.806 --> 59:20.974
you're ready for the tub.

59:26.897 --> 59:28.357
Mr. Flayman.

59:28.440 --> 59:29.942
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

59:30.025 --> 59:32.736
Where is the rest ofyour team?

59:32.819 --> 59:35.155
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

59:35.239 --> 59:37.908
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,

59:37.991 --> 59:40.702
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.

59:41.370 --> 59:43.580
I actually heard a funny story about...

59:43.664 --> 59:46.291
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs

59:46.375 --> 59:49.044
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?

59:49.127 --> 59:53.840
How much longerwill we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?

59:53.924 --> 59:58.387
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges

59:58.470 --> 1:00:02.808
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.

1:00:03.183 --> 1:00:06.395
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!

1:00:07.020 --> 1:00:08.772
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

1:00:08.855 --> 1:00:11.233
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.

1:00:11.316 --> 1:00:13.568
But you can't! We have a terrific case.

1:00:13.652 --> 1:00:16.405
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?

1:00:16.530 --> 1:00:19.658
Show me the smoking gun!

1:00:20.200 --> 1:00:22.995
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?

1:00:23.078 --> 1:00:25.414
Here is your smoking gun.

1:00:28.500 --> 1:00:30.002
What is that?

1:00:30.085 --> 1:00:31.545
It's a bee smoker!

1:00:31.628 --> 1:00:34.631
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?

1:00:34.715 --> 1:00:38.051
This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.

1:00:44.391 --> 1:00:46.435
Look at what has happened

1:00:46.518 --> 1:00:50.689
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"

1:00:50.772 --> 1:00:52.858
Is this what nature intended for us?

1:00:52.941 --> 1:00:55.819
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines

1:00:55.902 --> 1:00:58.322
in man-made wooden slat
work camps?

1:00:58.405 --> 1:01:03.118
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?

1:01:05.746 --> 1:01:09.041
-What are we gonna do?
-He's playing the species card.

1:01:09.583 --> 1:01:13.670
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!

1:01:13.754 --> 1:01:16.965
Free the bees! Free the bees!

1:01:17.049 --> 1:01:18.508
Free the bees!

1:01:18.592 --> 1:01:21.511
Free the bees! Free the bees!

1:01:21.595 --> 1:01:25.515
The court finds in favor of the bees!

1:01:25.599 --> 1:01:27.059
Vanessa, we won!

1:01:27.142 --> 1:01:30.145
I knew you could do it! High-five!

1:01:31.188 --> 1:01:32.230
Sorry.

1:01:32.314 --> 1:01:35.359
I'm okay! You know what this means?

1:01:35.442 --> 1:01:37.819
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.

1:01:37.903 --> 1:01:40.322
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.

1:01:43.116 --> 1:01:47.704
This is an unholy perversion
ofthe balance of nature, Benson.

1:01:47.788 --> 1:01:49.456
You'll regret this.

1:01:50.624 --> 1:01:52.709
Barry, how much honey is out there?

1:01:52.793 --> 1:01:54.586
All right. One at a time.

1:01:54.669 --> 1:01:56.380
Barry, who are you wearing?

1:01:56.463 --> 1:01:59.174
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.

1:01:59.674 --> 1:02:02.386
-What if Montgomery's right?
-What do you mean?

1:02:02.469 --> 1:02:06.598
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.

1:02:08.350 --> 1:02:12.396
Congratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?

1:02:12.479 --> 1:02:16.191
First, we'll demand a complete
shutdown of all bee work camps.

1:02:18.193 --> 1:02:21.154
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,

1:02:21.238 --> 1:02:22.864
every last drop.

1:02:22.948 --> 1:02:26.952
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more

1:02:27.035 --> 1:02:29.996
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.

1:02:30.330 --> 1:02:32.999
We're all aware
ofwhat they do in the woods.

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:35.419
Wait for my signal.

1:02:37.337 --> 1:02:38.547
Take him out.

1:02:40.549 --> 1:02:43.427
He'll have nausea for a few hours,
then he'll be fine.

1:02:43.510 --> 1:02:47.013
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...

1:02:47.097 --> 1:02:49.015
But it's just a prance-about stage name!

1:02:49.099 --> 1:02:52.436
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products

1:02:52.519 --> 1:02:56.231
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.

1:02:58.233 --> 1:02:59.526
Can't breathe.

1:03:02.028 --> 1:03:03.572
Bring it in, boys!

1:03:05.365 --> 1:03:07.701
Hold it right there! Good.

1:03:09.244 --> 1:03:10.662
Tap it.

1:03:14.458 --> 1:03:17.461
Mr. Buzzwell,
we just passed three cups,

1:03:17.544 --> 1:03:19.171
and there's gallons more coming!

1:03:19.254 --> 1:03:23.133
-I think we need to shut down!
-Shut down? We've never shut down.

1:03:24.217 --> 1:03:28.430
Shut down honey production!
Stop making honey!

1:03:33.101 --> 1:03:34.603
Turn your key, sir!

1:03:46.239 --> 1:03:47.574
What do we do now?

1:03:51.745 --> 1:03:53.413
Cannonball!

1:04:01.421 --> 1:04:03.256
We're shutting down honey production!

1:04:03.340 --> 1:04:04.508
Mission abort.

1:04:04.591 --> 1:04:08.094
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.

1:04:55.850 --> 1:04:58.603
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.

1:04:58.687 --> 1:04:59.646
Oh, yeah?

1:04:59.729 --> 1:05:02.482
What's going on? Where is everybody?

1:05:03.567 --> 1:05:05.819
-Are they out celebrating?
-They're home.

1:05:05.902 --> 1:05:09.155
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.

1:05:09.239 --> 1:05:12.325
I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.

1:05:12.409 --> 1:05:13.910
At least we got our honey back.

1:05:13.994 --> 1:05:18.164
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

1:05:18.248 --> 1:05:22.711
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.

1:05:23.837 --> 1:05:26.798
This was my new desk.
This was my new job.

1:05:26.881 --> 1:05:29.342
I wanted to do it really well. And now...

1:05:30.677 --> 1:05:32.345
Now I can't.

1:05:42.981 --> 1:05:45.859
I don't understand
why they're not happy.

1:05:45.942 --> 1:05:48.153
I thought their lives would be better!

1:05:48.236 --> 1:05:51.865
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.

1:05:51.948 --> 1:05:54.993
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?

1:05:55.076 --> 1:05:57.746
-What did you want to show me?
-This.

1:05:59.748 --> 1:06:01.041
What happened here?

1:06:01.124 --> 1:06:03.418
That is not the half of it.

1:06:09.674 --> 1:06:11.676
Oh, no. Oh, my.

1:06:12.552 --> 1:06:14.387
They're all wilting.

1:06:14.471 --> 1:06:16.556
Doesn't look very good, does it?

1:06:16.640 --> 1:06:17.974
No.

1:06:18.058 --> 1:06:20.769
And whose fault do you think that is?

1:06:23.396 --> 1:06:24.689
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.

1:06:24.773 --> 1:06:28.318
-Bees?
-Specifically, me.

1:06:28.401 --> 1:06:32.572
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.

1:06:32.656 --> 1:06:37.661
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.

1:06:37.744 --> 1:06:40.580
That's ourwhole SAT test right there.

1:06:40.664 --> 1:06:44.209
Take away produce,
that affects the entire animal kingdom.

1:06:44.292 --> 1:06:46.336
And then, of course...

1:06:46.419 --> 1:06:48.171
The human species?

1:06:50.799 --> 1:06:53.176
So ifthere's no more pollination,

1:06:53.259 --> 1:06:55.720
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?

1:06:55.804 --> 1:06:59.140
I know this is also partly my fault.

1:07:03.269 --> 1:07:05.397
How about a suicide pact?

1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:06.898
How do we do it?

1:07:06.981 --> 1:07:10.068
-I'll sting you, you step on me.
-Thatjust kills you twice.

1:07:10.151 --> 1:07:11.486
Right, right.

1:07:12.112 --> 1:07:16.199
Listen, Barry,
sorry, but I gotta get going.

1:07:23.164 --> 1:07:25.667
I had to open my mouth and talk.

1:07:28.294 --> 1:07:29.629
Vanessa?

1:07:32.465 --> 1:07:35.552
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?

1:07:35.635 --> 1:07:38.638
To the final Tournament of Roses
parade in Pasadena.

1:07:38.722 --> 1:07:42.642
They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.

1:07:42.726 --> 1:07:46.146
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.

1:07:46.229 --> 1:07:50.692
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.

1:07:50.775 --> 1:07:52.861
I know. Me neither.

1:07:55.447 --> 1:07:58.575
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.

1:07:59.826 --> 1:08:03.163
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

1:08:03.663 --> 1:08:05.165
Roses!

1:08:05.832 --> 1:08:07.667
Vanessa!

1:08:08.334 --> 1:08:09.961
Roses?

1:08:10.044 --> 1:08:11.296
Barry?

1:08:11.379 --> 1:08:14.466
-Roses are flowers!
-Yes, they are.

1:08:14.549 --> 1:08:17.510
Flowers, bees, pollen!

1:08:17.594 --> 1:08:20.972
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.

1:08:21.055 --> 1:08:25.101
Maybe not.
Could you ask him to slow down?

1:08:25.310 --> 1:08:26.895
Could you slow down?

1:08:29.689 --> 1:08:30.648
Barry!

1:08:30.732 --> 1:08:34.694
Okay, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.

1:08:34.778 --> 1:08:36.112
Yes, it kind of is.

1:08:36.196 --> 1:08:39.199
I've ruined the planet. I wanted
to help you with the flower shop.

1:08:39.282 --> 1:08:40.867
I've made it worse.

1:08:40.950 --> 1:08:43.369
Actually, it's completely closed down.

1:08:43.453 --> 1:08:45.371
I thought maybe you were remodeling.

1:08:45.455 --> 1:08:47.373
But I have another idea,

1:08:47.457 --> 1:08:49.709
and it's greater
than my previous ideas combined.

1:08:49.793 --> 1:08:51.586
I don't want to hear it!

1:08:52.545 --> 1:08:56.508
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.

1:08:56.591 --> 1:08:59.803
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.

1:08:59.886 --> 1:09:03.473
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.

1:09:03.556 --> 1:09:04.682
-Bees.
-Park.

1:09:04.766 --> 1:09:05.892
-Pollen!
-Flowers.

1:09:05.975 --> 1:09:08.436
-Repollination!
-Across the nation!

1:09:09.687 --> 1:09:12.398
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, California.

1:09:12.607 --> 1:09:15.610
They've got nothing but flowers,
floats and cotton candy.

1:09:15.693 --> 1:09:16.986
Security will be tight.

1:09:17.070 --> 1:09:18.822
l have an idea.

1:09:18.905 --> 1:09:20.657
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

1:09:20.740 --> 1:09:22.992
Official floral business. It's real.

1:09:23.159 --> 1:09:25.537
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.

1:09:25.620 --> 1:09:27.121
Thank you. It was a gift.

1:09:28.248 --> 1:09:30.583
Once inside, we just pick the right float.

1:09:32.252 --> 1:09:33.920
How aboutThe Princess and the Pea?

1:09:34.295 --> 1:09:37.215
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!

1:09:37.298 --> 1:09:38.591
Yes, I got it.

1:09:40.510 --> 1:09:42.679
-Where should I sit?
-What are you?

1:09:42.762 --> 1:09:44.597
-I believe I'm the pea.
-The pea?

1:09:44.681 --> 1:09:46.349
It goes under the mattresses.

1:09:46.432 --> 1:09:49.185
-Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
-I'm getting the marshal.

1:09:49.269 --> 1:09:52.272
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!

1:09:54.524 --> 1:09:56.317
Let's see what this baby'll do.

1:09:57.861 --> 1:09:59.821
Hey, what are you doing?

1:10:01.281 --> 1:10:06.160
Then all we do is blend in with traffic,
without arousing suspicion.

1:10:09.497 --> 1:10:12.208
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.

1:10:12.292 --> 1:10:13.251
Stop! Security.

1:10:13.334 --> 1:10:15.545
-You and your insect pack your float?
-Yes.

1:10:15.628 --> 1:10:18.131
Has it been in your possession
the entire time?

1:10:18.214 --> 1:10:20.508
Would you remove your shoes?

1:10:20.592 --> 1:10:22.886
-Remove your stinger.
-It's part of me.

1:10:22.969 --> 1:10:25.930
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.

1:10:32.312 --> 1:10:36.149
Then ifwe're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.

1:10:37.525 --> 1:10:38.943
Can you believe how lucky we are?

1:10:39.027 --> 1:10:41.112
We have just enough pollen
to do the job!

1:10:41.195 --> 1:10:42.780
I think this is gonna work.

1:10:42.864 --> 1:10:44.115
It's got to work.

1:10:44.198 --> 1:10:46.618
Attention, passengers,
this is Captain Scott.

1:10:46.701 --> 1:10:48.995
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.

1:10:49.078 --> 1:10:51.789
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.

1:10:51.873 --> 1:10:54.459
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water.

1:10:54.542 --> 1:10:55.835
They'll never make it.

1:10:55.919 --> 1:10:58.004
I gotta get up there and talk to them.

1:10:58.087 --> 1:10:59.380
Be careful.

1:11:02.050 --> 1:11:04.510
Can I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?

1:11:04.594 --> 1:11:08.556
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.

1:11:12.769 --> 1:11:14.520
Captain, I'm in a real situation.

1:11:14.604 --> 1:11:16.314
-What'd you say, Hal?
-Nothing.

1:11:16.731 --> 1:11:18.066
Bee!

1:11:18.149 --> 1:11:20.985
Don't freak out! My entire species...

1:11:25.573 --> 1:11:26.908
What are you doing?

1:11:31.621 --> 1:11:34.874
-Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
-Who's an attorney?

1:11:34.958 --> 1:11:36.084
Don't move.

1:11:41.172 --> 1:11:42.256
Oh, Barry.

1:11:43.257 --> 1:11:46.010
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.

1:11:46.094 --> 1:11:50.515
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?

1:11:50.598 --> 1:11:52.266
And please hurry!

1:11:54.936 --> 1:11:56.354
What happened here?

1:11:56.437 --> 1:11:59.732
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.

1:11:59.816 --> 1:12:02.944
One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!

1:12:03.778 --> 1:12:05.488
-Is that another bee joke?
-No!

1:12:05.571 --> 1:12:07.198
No one's flying the plane!

1:12:07.281 --> 1:12:11.452
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?

1:12:11.536 --> 1:12:14.872
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.

1:12:14.956 --> 1:12:16.124
Where's the pilot?

1:12:16.207 --> 1:12:18.710
He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.

1:12:18.793 --> 1:12:22.005
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?

1:12:22.088 --> 1:12:23.715
As a matter offact, there is.

1:12:23.798 --> 1:12:25.717
-Who's that?
-Barry Benson.

1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:28.052
From the honey trial? Oh, great.

1:12:28.136 --> 1:12:30.722
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.

1:12:30.805 --> 1:12:32.807
It's got giant wings, huge engines.

1:12:32.890 --> 1:12:34.183
I can't fly a plane.

1:12:34.267 --> 1:12:36.728
-Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
-Yes.

1:12:36.811 --> 1:12:38.521
How hard could it be?

1:12:39.689 --> 1:12:42.400
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.

1:12:45.486 --> 1:12:49.490
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,

1:12:49.574 --> 1:12:52.410
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.

1:12:52.493 --> 1:12:55.163
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...

1:12:55.246 --> 1:12:56.414
That's Barry!

1:12:56.497 --> 1:12:59.959
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers

1:13:00.043 --> 1:13:02.253
and an incapacitated flight crew.

1:13:02.336 --> 1:13:03.421
Flowers?

1:13:03.504 --> 1:13:07.800
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls

1:13:07.884 --> 1:13:10.136
with absolutely no flight experience.

1:13:10.219 --> 1:13:13.097
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.

1:13:13.181 --> 1:13:17.435
I'm quite familiarwith Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.

1:13:17.518 --> 1:13:19.103
They've done enough damage.

1:13:19.187 --> 1:13:21.064
But isn't he your only hope?

1:13:21.147 --> 1:13:23.941
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.

1:13:24.025 --> 1:13:25.943
Theirwings are too small...

1:13:26.027 --> 1:13:28.362
Haven't we heard this a million times?

1:13:28.446 --> 1:13:32.158
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense."

1:13:32.241 --> 1:13:33.951
-Get this on the air!
-Got it.

1:13:34.035 --> 1:13:35.828
-Stand by.
-We're going live.

1:13:36.871 --> 1:13:39.123
The way we work
may be a mystery to you.

1:13:39.207 --> 1:13:43.086
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.

1:13:43.169 --> 1:13:45.296
But let me tell you about a small job.

1:13:45.379 --> 1:13:48.216
Ifyou do it well,
it makes a big difference.

1:13:48.299 --> 1:13:51.219
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.

1:13:51.302 --> 1:13:55.139
That's why l want to get bees
back to working together.

1:13:55.223 --> 1:13:56.766
That's the bee way!

1:13:56.849 --> 1:14:00.144
We're not made of Jell-O.
We get behind a fellow.

1:14:00.228 --> 1:14:02.563
-Black and yellow!
-Hello!

1:14:06.484 --> 1:14:08.152
Left, right, down, hover.

1:14:08.236 --> 1:14:09.987
-Hover?
-Forget hover.

1:14:10.071 --> 1:14:12.615
This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!

1:14:15.576 --> 1:14:17.328
Barry, what happened?

1:14:17.411 --> 1:14:20.331
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.

1:14:20.414 --> 1:14:23.459
-That may have been helping me.
-And now we're not!

1:14:23.543 --> 1:14:26.129
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.

1:14:29.423 --> 1:14:33.845
All ofyou, let's get behind this fellow!
Move it out!

1:14:34.262 --> 1:14:35.930
Move out!

1:14:43.813 --> 1:14:45.857
Our only chance is if l do what I'd do,

1:14:45.940 --> 1:14:47.817
you copy me
with the wings ofthe plane!

1:14:47.900 --> 1:14:48.901
Don't have to yell.

1:14:48.985 --> 1:14:51.529
I'm not yelling! We're in a lot oftrouble.

1:14:51.612 --> 1:14:55.199
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!

1:14:55.283 --> 1:14:58.119
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!

1:15:08.880 --> 1:15:10.089
I can't do this!

1:15:10.173 --> 1:15:13.718
Vanessa, pull yourselftogether.
You have to snap out of it!

1:15:13.801 --> 1:15:14.969
You snap out of it.

1:15:15.052 --> 1:15:16.137
You snap out of it.

1:15:16.220 --> 1:15:18.472
-You snap out of it!
-You snap out of it!

1:15:18.556 --> 1:15:21.142
-You snap out of it!
-You snap out of it!

1:15:41.078 --> 1:15:43.539
-You snap out of it!
-You snap out of it!

1:15:43.623 --> 1:15:45.917
-Hold it!
-Why? Come on, it's my turn.

1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:48.127
How is the plane flying?

1:15:48.502 --> 1:15:49.670
I don't know.

1:15:50.504 --> 1:15:51.505
Hello?

1:15:51.589 --> 1:15:54.675
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?

1:15:54.759 --> 1:15:56.093
The Pollen Jocks!

1:15:56.177 --> 1:15:58.095
They do get behind a fellow.

1:15:58.179 --> 1:15:59.764
-Black and yellow.
-Hello.

1:15:59.847 --> 1:16:03.100
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.

1:16:03.184 --> 1:16:05.937
Where? I can't see anything. Can you?

1:16:06.020 --> 1:16:08.272
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

1:16:08.356 --> 1:16:10.775
Come on. You got to think bee, Barry.

1:16:10.858 --> 1:16:12.777
-Thinking bee.
-Thinking bee.

1:16:12.860 --> 1:16:16.113
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1:16:16.197 --> 1:16:18.950
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.

1:16:19.033 --> 1:16:21.744
-What?
-I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.

1:16:21.827 --> 1:16:24.121
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.

1:16:24.205 --> 1:16:25.539
Bring the nose down.

1:16:28.459 --> 1:16:31.963
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1:16:32.046 --> 1:16:36.133
-What in the world is on the tarmac?
-Get some lights on that!

1:16:36.217 --> 1:16:40.054
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1:16:40.137 --> 1:16:42.473
-Vanessa, aim for the flower.
-Okay.

1:16:42.556 --> 1:16:43.975
Cut the engines.

1:16:44.058 --> 1:16:46.644
We're going in on bee power.
Ready, boys?

1:16:46.727 --> 1:16:47.895
Affirmative!

1:16:50.731 --> 1:16:53.234
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.

1:16:53.317 --> 1:16:54.986
Land on that flower!

1:16:55.069 --> 1:16:56.654
Ready? Full reverse!

1:16:56.737 --> 1:16:57.905
Spin it around!

1:17:01.075 --> 1:17:03.244
-Not that flower! The other one!
-Which one?

1:17:03.327 --> 1:17:05.538
-That flower.
-I'm aiming at the flower!

1:17:05.621 --> 1:17:10.251
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower

1:17:10.334 --> 1:17:13.170
made of millions of bees!

1:17:13.254 --> 1:17:16.257
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.

1:17:16.924 --> 1:17:18.592
Rotate around it.

1:17:19.093 --> 1:17:22.596
-This is insane, Barry!
-This is the only way I know how to fly.

1:17:22.680 --> 1:17:26.684
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?

1:17:26.767 --> 1:17:30.187
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!

1:17:30.271 --> 1:17:32.315
Just drop it. Be a part of it.

1:17:32.940 --> 1:17:37.737
Aim for the center!
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

1:17:48.289 --> 1:17:49.957
Come on, already.

1:17:54.795 --> 1:17:58.215
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!

1:17:58.299 --> 1:18:00.718
-Yes. No high-five!
-Right.

1:18:00.801 --> 1:18:03.721
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?

1:18:03.804 --> 1:18:08.267
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!

1:18:08.351 --> 1:18:10.895
-Thank you.
-But we're not done yet.

1:18:19.987 --> 1:18:21.238
Listen, everyone!

1:18:21.322 --> 1:18:23.824
This runway is covered
with the last pollen

1:18:23.908 --> 1:18:26.911
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.

1:18:26.994 --> 1:18:29.080
That means this is our last chance.

1:18:29.163 --> 1:18:34.335
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.

1:18:34.668 --> 1:18:37.963
Ifwe're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment!

1:18:38.047 --> 1:18:39.673
What do you say?

1:18:39.757 --> 1:18:44.678
Are we going to be bees, or just
Museum of Natural History keychains?

1:18:44.762 --> 1:18:46.305
We're bees!

1:18:46.389 --> 1:18:47.556
Keychain!

1:18:47.640 --> 1:18:51.435
Then follow me! Except Keychain.

1:18:51.519 --> 1:18:53.437
Hold on, Barry. Here.

1:18:53.521 --> 1:18:55.022
You've earned this.

1:19:01.862 --> 1:19:03.572
Yeah!

1:19:06.367 --> 1:19:11.372
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit.
All I gotta do are the sleeves.

1:19:15.459 --> 1:19:16.794
Oh, yeah.

1:19:16.877 --> 1:19:18.629
That's our Barry.

1:19:22.049 --> 1:19:24.218
Here comes the sun

1:19:25.719 --> 1:19:27.388
Here comes the sun

1:19:27.471 --> 1:19:31.434
And l say, it's all right

1:19:34.228 --> 1:19:36.063
Little darling

1:19:36.147 --> 1:19:40.192
lt's been a long, cold, lonely winter

1:19:41.527 --> 1:19:47.074
Little darling
lt feels like years since it's been here

1:19:48.576 --> 1:19:50.578
Here comes the sun

1:19:52.163 --> 1:19:57.251
Here comes the sun
And l say, it's all right

1:20:04.675 --> 1:20:06.427
Little darling

1:20:06.510 --> 1:20:10.514
The smiles returning to the faces

1:20:11.765 --> 1:20:13.142
Little darling

1:20:13.601 --> 1:20:17.438
lt seems like years since it's been here

1:20:19.106 --> 1:20:21.275
Here comes the sun

1:20:22.568 --> 1:20:24.403
Here comes the sun

1:20:24.487 --> 1:20:28.199
And l say, it's all right

1:20:28.282 --> 1:20:30.242
Mom! The bees are back!

1:20:40.127 --> 1:20:43.214
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes!

1:20:43.297 --> 1:20:45.549
If anybody needs to make a call,
now's the time.

1:20:45.633 --> 1:20:48.093
I got a feeling
we'll be working late tonight!

1:20:57.186 --> 1:21:02.399
Little darling
l feel the ice is slowly melting

1:21:02.483 --> 1:21:05.569
Here's your change.
Have a great afternoon!

1:21:05.653 --> 1:21:07.321
Can I help who's next?

1:21:07.655 --> 1:21:12.201
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.

1:21:12.618 --> 1:21:16.789
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!

1:21:17.998 --> 1:21:20.918
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!

1:21:21.001 --> 1:21:22.503
I had no idea.

1:21:22.586 --> 1:21:24.797
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?

1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:28.259
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.

1:21:28.342 --> 1:21:29.343
Sorry I'm late.

1:21:29.426 --> 1:21:30.553
He's a lawyer, too?

1:21:30.636 --> 1:21:35.432
I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.

1:21:35.516 --> 1:21:37.351
Have a great afternoon!

1:21:37.434 --> 1:21:41.605
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.

1:21:41.689 --> 1:21:44.066
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.

1:21:44.149 --> 1:21:46.944
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Can I help who's next?

1:21:47.027 --> 1:21:50.114
All right, scramble, Jocks!
It's time to fly.

1:21:50.197 --> 1:21:52.032
Thank you, Barry!

1:21:54.785 --> 1:21:57.037
That bee is living my life!

1:21:57.121 --> 1:21:58.247
Let it go, Kenny.

1:21:58.330 --> 1:22:00.916
-When will this nightmare end?
-Let it all go.

1:22:02.376 --> 1:22:05.713
Here comes the sun

1:22:05.796 --> 1:22:07.131
Here comes the sun

1:22:07.214 --> 1:22:09.466
-Beautiful day to fly.
-Sure is.

1:22:09.550 --> 1:22:13.178
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out ofthat office.

1:22:15.014 --> 1:22:17.057
lt's all right

1:29:42.502 --> 1:29:45.297
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.

1:29:45.380 --> 1:29:47.174
-Thinking bee!
-Me?

1:29:47.257 --> 1:29:51.261
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Get smart and start thinking bee!

1:29:51.344 --> 1:29:52.304
Gee!

1:29:52.387 --> 1:29:54.848
-Flying here and buzzing there
-l'm loving the views

1:29:54.931 --> 1:29:59.186
Listen to me, cousin
Every buzzer must choose to be a bee

1:29:59.853 --> 1:30:02.522
-Or not to be
-Start thinking bee

1:30:02.606 --> 1:30:05.525
-Barry, you got no occupation
-You mean like pollination?

1:30:05.609 --> 1:30:08.195
-Hey, now, that's thinking bee!
-Start thinking bee

1:30:08.278 --> 1:30:10.447
Listen, fella
Ain't you been on the tour?

1:30:10.530 --> 1:30:13.283
-Your stripes are black and yella
-l just want to be sure

1:30:13.366 --> 1:30:15.786
-To be a bee
-Start thinking bee

1:30:15.869 --> 1:30:18.622
-Can't l wait and see?
-No, Barry, that's not to be

1:30:18.705 --> 1:30:21.541
Be a busy little bee
Not a tizzy little bee

1:30:21.625 --> 1:30:24.628
Hold it. Let's just stop for a second.
Hold it.

1:30:24.711 --> 1:30:28.298
l'm sorry. l'm sorry, everyone.
Can we stop here?

1:30:28.381 --> 1:30:31.802
l'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!

1:30:31.885 --> 1:30:34.971
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.

1:30:35.055 --> 1:30:37.182
l had virtually no rehearsal for that.
