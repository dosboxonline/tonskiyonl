Lots of great song ideas
over here.

07:28.523 --> 07:30.507
-Well, I've got nothing.
-Oh, phew. Me neither.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.784
-I've got something.
-Is that my journal?

07:33.011 --> 07:34.177
Yeah, sometimes
when I'm blocked,

07:34.270 --> 07:35.679
I flip through it
for inspiration.

07:35.697 --> 07:37.180
-You do?
-Look at this.

07:37.273 --> 07:39.032
-Whoa.
-That's a song.

07:39.184 --> 07:40.625
-It is.
-Let me see.

You were pressing very hard
with your pen in this section.

07:43.464 --> 07:44.796

07:45.023 --> 07:47.524

when I'm feeling blocked" part.

journal without asking.

-Mom.

-We're songwriting.
-No, we're songwriting.

07:55.050 --> 07:56.382
No parents.
It's a surprise.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.551
Fine. I'll go watch
the computer with your father.

07:58.628 --> 08:00.145

your grandma's password?

-Tina, that stuff is better

08:03.375 --> 08:05.025
than anything else
we're gonna come up with.

08:05.210 --> 08:06.226
All it needs is some bongo.

08:06.378 --> 08:07.319
That's true about everything.

08:07.470 --> 08:08.820
But it-it's embarrassing.

W-What if Jimmy Junior comes
to the open mic night, he--

08:11.383 --> 08:12.549
Wait, he may be busy.

08:12.642 --> 08:14.234
I think he has
a wrestling meet that night.

08:14.386 --> 08:16.386
Give me the journal.
He does. Hmm.

08:16.479 --> 08:19.146

It's away, that's good.

the things I wrote

08:25.764 --> 08:28.081

"They Didn't Feel
Like Doing This,"

That's private. Excuse me.

Thank you. I'll take that.
Gene, Louise, not okay.

We need to audition
people today.

08:51.106 --> 08:52.255

at our house on Friday night?

You're all in the band.
You saw some of the notes.

-What?
-I mean, uh, good. Yup.

09:13.962 --> 09:15.295
-He plays guitar.
-Uh-huh.

09:15.447 --> 09:17.222
You know, I give him
a hard time sometimes

09:17.449 --> 09:19.783
because he's annoying,
but i-it'd be fun.

09:19.801 --> 09:22.060
He wants to do a bossa nova.
What's a bossa nova?

09:22.229 --> 09:23.970
Uh, I think it's Latin Jazz?

09:24.122 --> 09:26.213
What? Why did I agree
to do this with Mort?

the main exit that much.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.234
You just have to go like this

15:20.253 --> 15:22.311
to get by the harp
and the speaker.

15:22.405 --> 15:24.756
-I'm shutting this down.
-[whimpers]

15:29.170 --> 15:30.411
-Shutting us down?
-And fining you.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.930
-Don't gloss over that.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:32.081 --> 15:33.322
Is someone shutting us down?

15:33.341 --> 15:35.324
-Louise.
-No! We haven't gone yet.

15:35.343 --> 15:37.660
We rehearsed two and half times.

15:37.829 --> 15:39.845
What, is this guy
the fire marshal or something?

15:39.940 --> 15:41.439
-Yes.
-Oh. Hi.

15:41.590 --> 15:42.999
[fire marshal] You want to make
the announcement or should I?

15:43.017 --> 15:44.333
[Bob]
Oh, no, like,

15:44.352 --> 15:45.685
tell people they have to leave?

15:45.779 --> 15:47.278
That's how
getting shut down works.

15:47.430 --> 15:49.263
Teddy and Mort, everyone.
Teddy and Mort.

15:49.357 --> 15:52.599
-[applause]
-Good thing you're a mortician,
Mort, 'cause you killed.

15:52.694 --> 15:54.360
I-It's just, we haven't sold
that many burgers.

15:54.512 --> 15:56.788
Could they order a bunch of food
to go before they leave?

15:57.015 --> 15:58.605
Seems like you want me
to shut it down.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.291
Folks--
Oh. Marshmallow.

16:00.518 --> 16:02.460
-Marty.
-Oh, you-you know each other?

16:02.537 --> 16:04.611
Marty, you are not about
to mess with my moment.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.856
-Were you gonna sing?
-For my parents.

16:06.949 --> 16:10.526
-I, um...
-They've never heard me sing.

16:10.545 --> 16:13.196
Uh, and they live far away,
and they're old.

16:13.289 --> 16:14.621
-Oh... [chuckles]
-Marty,

16:14.716 --> 16:16.808
-who saved your life
in that nightclub?
-You did.

16:16.959 --> 16:18.718
And who never told anyone
that embarrassing way

16:18.812 --> 16:20.461
you almost died
in that nightclub?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.146
-You.
-And what were you doing
in that nightclub?

16:22.298 --> 16:23.539
Were you dancing, Marty?

16:23.632 --> 16:25.391
-I was dancing, and-and--
-You were dancing

16:25.485 --> 16:26.651
with an open flame,
weren't you, Marty?

16:26.878 --> 16:28.044
-I was--
-The fire marshal.

16:28.062 --> 16:29.821
Yes, I w-- I made a mistake.

16:29.972 --> 16:32.565
-And did you start
a fire, Marty?
-I-I did start a fire.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.808
And I carried you
out of that building, Marty,

16:34.828 --> 16:35.827
like a baby.

16:35.978 --> 16:37.328
Yes, I-I felt very safe.

16:37.555 --> 16:38.738
Louise, how many more acts?

16:38.890 --> 16:40.481
-Fischoeder, you, us.
-Marty.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.392
Code enforcement
starts with this code.

16:43.411 --> 16:45.486
It doesn't, but you know what?

16:45.505 --> 16:47.488
I counted wrong,
and those guys are leaving.

16:47.582 --> 16:49.415
A-And look at that,
they barely have to form

16:49.567 --> 16:50.916
a single-file line
to push their way out.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.159
I'm a big music fan.

16:52.253 --> 16:53.511
Did I tell you
I was a music fan?

16:53.662 --> 16:55.329
-No.
-Great.
-Let's hear some music.

16:55.423 --> 16:56.830
Attaboy.
