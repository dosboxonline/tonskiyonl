WEBVTT

00:16.726 --> 00:18.769
(siren wailing)

00:21.147 --> 00:23.858
So, you're-you're not a Fed?

00:23.899 --> 00:26.026
Do you hear that?
That's the old bill.

00:26.068 --> 00:27.737
So unless you want to explain
why you've got

00:27.778 --> 00:30.865
America's favorite invisible
wanker dead on the floor,

00:30.906 --> 00:32.950
give us a fucking hand,
will ya?

00:36.662 --> 00:38.289
Aw, shit.

00:53.846 --> 00:58.726
All right, listen,
I have worked for the Feds.

00:58.768 --> 01:00.978
I've worked for loads of people.

01:01.020 --> 01:05.357
I'm what you might call
an independent contractor.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.777
You got a problem, you call me,
I solve the problem.

01:09.779 --> 01:11.781
(pounding in trunk)

01:18.829 --> 01:20.748
What is that?

01:20.790 --> 01:22.500
(pounding continues)

01:22.541 --> 01:25.377
That's a problem.

01:25.419 --> 01:28.130
Oh, thank fuck, he's alive.

01:28.172 --> 01:31.300
Yes, yes, he's alive!
Okay, pull over.

01:31.342 --> 01:33.010
No, no, no, Hughie,
you don't fucking get it.

01:33.052 --> 01:35.638
-Pull the car over.
-This is a fucksight worse.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.473
He's seen our faces.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.772
Oh, my God.

01:44.814 --> 01:46.023
No, no, no, no, no.
I can't do this.

01:46.065 --> 01:48.067
I can't do this.
Let me out.

01:49.276 --> 01:52.488
-Let me out. Pull over!
-Hughie,

01:52.530 --> 01:55.866
you walk away now, and you will
never get payback for Robin.

01:55.908 --> 01:57.284
You'll spend the rest
of your life

01:57.326 --> 01:59.161
sitting on your ass
with fucking regret.

01:59.203 --> 02:00.746
Now, is that what you want?

02:06.585 --> 02:10.756
I know a bloke.
Top man.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.258
He'll know what to do.

02:24.436 --> 02:25.729
Morning, luv.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.940
Frenchie about?

02:27.982 --> 02:30.526
(loud music playing inside)

02:33.988 --> 02:36.365
Mmm.

02:45.749 --> 02:48.043
You'll love this guy.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.504
(dance music playing loudly)

02:50.546 --> 02:52.840
(man singing in French)

02:57.887 --> 02:59.471
Frenchie.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.891
Oi, Frenchie.

03:01.932 --> 03:02.933
(music volume lowers)

03:05.269 --> 03:07.104
Monsieur Charcuter.

03:07.146 --> 03:09.398
Huh.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.276
This is a surprise.

03:12.318 --> 03:13.903
Good to see you.

03:13.944 --> 03:15.738
Good to see you, too, mate.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.160
Means you brought that 40,000
you owe me?

03:21.201 --> 03:22.578
(Frenchie sniffs)

03:22.620 --> 03:24.955
I mean, why else would you
show your face around here?

03:24.997 --> 03:30.252
Because I've got something
even better for you.

03:30.294 --> 03:34.757
How would you like
to double your money?

03:34.798 --> 03:36.800
(both laughing)

03:43.223 --> 03:45.476
The double of zero is zero.

03:45.517 --> 03:46.852
Who is he?

03:46.894 --> 03:48.395
This guy?

03:48.437 --> 03:50.064
Oh, this here is
Hughie Campbell.

03:50.105 --> 03:53.359
We're, uh, working
a little job together.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.526
Ooh.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.781
-And he's still alive?
-(laughs)

04:01.116 --> 04:03.160
You and I worked together,
and you're still in one piece.

04:03.202 --> 04:05.329
Am I?

04:05.371 --> 04:10.751
Look, do you want to know
what the fucking job is or not?

04:14.213 --> 04:16.382
Open it.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.217
Who is in there?

04:20.552 --> 04:23.430
-Where's your sense
of adventure, Frenchie?
-(cattle prod crackles)

04:29.436 --> 04:32.523
TRANSLUCENT:
You dumb fucks are fucking dead!

04:32.564 --> 04:33.983
Have you any...
Aah!

04:36.944 --> 04:38.821
-That's Translucent.
-(trunk slams shut)

04:38.862 --> 04:40.864
You got Translucent
in your trunk, huh?

04:40.906 --> 04:42.282
Nothing gets past you, mate.

04:42.324 --> 04:44.868
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:44.910 --> 04:46.328
Go away.
Get him out of here.

04:46.370 --> 04:47.329
All right, all right, easy.

04:47.371 --> 04:48.789
He's chipped.

04:48.831 --> 04:50.207
The Supes could be
on their way.

04:50.249 --> 04:51.709
Homelander could be on his way
right now.

04:51.750 --> 04:52.751
Wait, he's chipped?

04:52.793 --> 04:54.003
FRENCHIE:
You bring this to my doorstep?

04:54.044 --> 04:55.879
This is not my problem, huh?

04:55.921 --> 04:59.341
Well, it is now.
He knows what you look like.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.928
Look, Frenchie, I need
your help, mate,

05:02.970 --> 05:04.722
and I ain't leaving
till I get it,

05:04.763 --> 05:07.057
or till The Seven show up.

05:14.565 --> 05:18.736
Ah, here comes the A-Train!

05:18.777 --> 05:20.487
My man, how you doing?

05:20.529 --> 05:22.448
Look, I brought you something.

05:24.450 --> 05:27.244
-Thanks?
-Yeah.

05:27.286 --> 05:31.290
I'm sorry, I asked
for Translucent.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.625
Right, but Translucent is
on a secret,

05:33.667 --> 05:35.753
undercover mission right now.

05:35.794 --> 05:37.880
But you got the A-Train, baby.

05:37.921 --> 05:40.007
(clicks tongue)

05:40.049 --> 05:44.011
But... my wish was
to meet Translucent.

05:44.053 --> 05:48.724
That was my only wish.
He's my hero.

05:48.766 --> 05:53.771
Yeah. Um... well, you know,
maybe he can swing by

05:53.812 --> 05:56.815
next week or some--

05:56.857 --> 05:58.859
-something...
-(monitor beeping steadily)

06:00.903 --> 06:02.780
(quietly): Fuck.

06:02.821 --> 06:06.366
Um... you know what?

06:06.408 --> 06:07.993
Maybe I can't turn invisible,

06:08.035 --> 06:11.163
but I am the world's
fastest man.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.916
Like, I can outrun anybody
or anything.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.459
That's-that's something, right?

06:15.501 --> 06:17.419
(chuckles weakly)

06:17.461 --> 06:19.213
Look, I'll tell you what,
you get better,

06:19.254 --> 06:21.799
and I'll teach you to run
as fast as me.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.093
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.386
You'll teach me
to outrun cancer?

06:29.932 --> 06:32.434
(sighs)

06:32.476 --> 06:34.228
Yeah.

06:35.437 --> 06:37.731
Oh, my God, turn that off.

06:37.773 --> 06:39.274
How many times do I have
to tell you

06:39.316 --> 06:40.651
that A-Train needs
to be scripted?

06:40.692 --> 06:42.111
-Right.
-When he does not have a script,

06:42.152 --> 06:44.071
-this is what happens.
-I'm on it. I'm so sorry.

06:44.113 --> 06:45.823
-It will not happen again.
-All right.

06:45.864 --> 06:47.032
And where is Translucent?

06:47.074 --> 06:48.534
We know he's not
in the building.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.244
He hasn't triggered any
of the motion sensors.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.246
He's probably out on another one
of his fucking benders.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.164
Doesn't he have a team-up
tomorrow night?

06:54.206 --> 06:55.415
Yeah, with the Deep.

06:55.457 --> 06:56.667
-Get a backup.
-I'm on it.

06:56.708 --> 06:57.876
-Okay, go.
-(phone ringing)

06:57.918 --> 06:59.878
Okay.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.171
Hello?

07:06.760 --> 07:08.387
Black Noir.

07:08.428 --> 07:12.057
We haven't properly met yet.
I'm Starlight.

07:19.815 --> 07:21.191
Well--
(sighs)

07:21.233 --> 07:24.194
I look forward
to working with you.

07:24.236 --> 07:26.196
ASHLEY:
There she is.

07:26.238 --> 07:28.574
Hi. How you settling in?

07:28.615 --> 07:31.910
Well, uh, it's an adjustment.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.203
That's for sure.

07:33.245 --> 07:34.580
-This is Trevor...
-Hi.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.998
...from Crime Analytics.

07:36.039 --> 07:38.750
So, we have exciting news
for you.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.628
We are sending you
on your first patrol.

07:41.670 --> 07:44.006
-(gasps)
-It's a team-up tomorrow night.

07:44.047 --> 07:45.757
Oh, that's great.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.051
That's great news.
Thank you.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.928
Hi. Big fan.
There you go.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.597
-STARLIGHT: A crime itinerary?
-TREVOR: Yep.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.140
Where and when to find
the bad guys.

07:53.182 --> 07:55.309
That's what my department does.
We vet leads,

07:55.350 --> 07:56.810
crunch satellite data,
COMP-STAT.

07:56.852 --> 07:58.395
Better intel than the police.

07:58.437 --> 08:00.522
-Mm.
-You know, thanks, but I'm good.

08:00.564 --> 08:02.858
I-I like to do
my own investigating.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.651
ASHLEY:
And that is why we love you,

08:04.693 --> 08:05.819
but it's not coming from us.

08:05.861 --> 08:07.571
It's corporate.
To protect you.

08:07.613 --> 08:08.989
What if you nab
the wrong person?

08:09.031 --> 08:10.866
There's liability to consider.

08:10.908 --> 08:14.119
The-the Deep is coming?

08:14.161 --> 08:15.746
Yeah,
it's a water-adjacent crime.

08:15.787 --> 08:19.082
Then he should do it himself.
He doesn't need me.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.001
ASHLEY:
It was gonna be Deep
and Translucent,

08:21.043 --> 08:25.172
but everyone on 82 is so excited
to get you out there.

08:25.214 --> 08:27.883
Yeah, it's just, uh, you know,
back in Des Moines,

08:27.925 --> 08:29.718
I always patrolled alone.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.803
ASHLEY:
And that is why we love you.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.722
But we see at least
a 23% uptick

08:33.764 --> 08:35.933
in social media mentions
and hero hashtags

08:35.974 --> 08:37.392
when there's a team-up.

08:37.434 --> 08:38.435
People love a team-up.

08:38.477 --> 08:40.145
-Love a team-up.
-Mm.

I know so many
invisible assholes.

TRANSLUCENT:
You fucking amateurs!

09:41.248 --> 09:43.292
-(electricity crackling)
-(Translucent cries out)

09:43.333 --> 09:44.835
Fuck!

09:44.876 --> 09:46.628
What the fuck?!

09:46.670 --> 09:48.130
Ooh, mind them bars, son.

09:48.171 --> 09:50.716
You'll only bollocks
yourself again.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.134
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.594
Uh, okay, what do
you guys want? Money?

09:54.636 --> 09:57.597
We don't want
your fucking money.

10:01.184 --> 10:04.396
What do you think, Frenchie?

10:04.438 --> 10:05.981
You just dropped
the Moby fucking Dick

10:06.023 --> 10:07.566
of problems on my plate.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.485
That's what I think.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.821
Okay?

10:12.863 --> 10:15.407
He can re-order his carbon
on his skin into metamaterial.

10:15.449 --> 10:18.118
(sighs)
It's hard as diamonds.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.828
It's nearly impossible
to penetrate.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.414
BUTCHER: All right,
how 'bout we suffocate him?

10:22.456 --> 10:24.291
FRENCHIE: Some Dominicans
already tried this,

10:24.333 --> 10:25.959
way back in '07.

10:26.001 --> 10:27.627
BUTCHER:
And what happened?

10:27.669 --> 10:28.879
FRENCHIE:
They're all fucking dead now.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.423
That's what happened.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.008
BUTCHER: All right, then,
fuck it, electrocution.

10:33.050 --> 10:34.259
We'll just increase the amps.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.802
FRENCHIE: You already hit him
with enough to drop

10:35.844 --> 10:37.512
a water buffalo, and look.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.556
Might knock him out.
Doesn't seem to kill him, huh?

10:39.598 --> 10:42.225
No. We need to pierce
the skin somehow.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.978
BUTCHER:
Well, how the hell
are we gonna do that?

10:45.020 --> 10:46.980
FRENCHIE:
I don't know.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.482
You're gonna kill him?

10:49.441 --> 10:51.109
(Butcher scoffs)

10:51.151 --> 10:53.528
We didn't bring him here
for a fucking Happy Meal.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.657
I don't-- I thought we'd
question him or something.

10:57.699 --> 11:00.494
I don't know, you get a-- you
get ahold of someone this big...

11:00.535 --> 11:03.663
At Gitmo, we had to water board
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed

11:03.705 --> 11:08.293
183 times over six months
to get him to talk just once.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.961
Now, we ain't got six months.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.422
I doubt we've even got
six hours.

11:14.257 --> 11:17.594
There are so many crazy things
about what you just said,

11:17.636 --> 11:20.680
but right now, you're talking
about randomly killing

11:20.722 --> 11:24.559
one of the most famous men
on the planet.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.436
A goddamn national treasure.

11:26.478 --> 11:30.816
I mean... people tend to notice
that kind of thing.

11:30.857 --> 11:33.985
And if we let him go...

11:34.027 --> 11:36.196
what do you think The Seven
will do to us?

11:36.238 --> 11:38.782
-Hmm?
-(sighs)

11:38.824 --> 11:42.953
You can't get A-Train if you're
a greasy smear on the pavement.

11:44.996 --> 11:47.165
I'm not a murderer.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.000
(Butcher scoffs)

11:49.042 --> 11:52.129
That's all right.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.589
-I am.
-(Hughie exhales)

11:56.299 --> 11:58.427
The race is coming up quickly.
How you feeling?

11:58.468 --> 12:00.595
Look, A-Train is
a fierce competitor,

12:00.637 --> 12:02.556
but no one can be the world's
fastest man forever.

12:02.597 --> 12:03.890
Let's just say I like my chan...

12:03.932 --> 12:05.475
HOMELANDER DOLL:
I'll always protect you.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.686
FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Your little
hero will never be afraid

12:07.727 --> 12:09.396
with the Junior
Homelander Cuddle...

12:09.438 --> 12:13.275
I regret to inform you that I've
located the mayor's Gulfstream.

12:13.316 --> 12:16.319
It's about two miles down at
the bottom of Hudson Canyon.

12:16.361 --> 12:17.863
There are no survivors,

12:17.904 --> 12:20.449
and I've yet to locate
the flight recorder.

12:20.490 --> 12:21.741
Though the jet was fragmented,

12:21.783 --> 12:23.702
there was one engine
fully intact,

12:23.743 --> 12:25.454
and it appears to be
engine failure.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.914
So I'd like to offer...

12:27.956 --> 12:29.833
(door opens)

12:29.875 --> 12:30.876
Whoa...

12:30.917 --> 12:33.712
(both chuckle)

12:33.753 --> 12:36.506
-Still going strong, huh?
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

12:36.548 --> 12:37.799
I've just been pumping
for 30 minutes,

12:37.841 --> 12:39.301
and I got a quarter of an ounce.

12:39.342 --> 12:41.511
Hey, hey, go easy on yourself.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.346
Come on, now.

12:43.388 --> 12:47.350
Personally, I think it's amazing
that a woman your age

12:47.392 --> 12:50.437
can have a baby, period.

12:50.479 --> 12:52.731
That is so sweet of you to say.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.567
Oh, no problem.

12:55.609 --> 12:56.902
Hey, you found Translucent yet?

12:56.943 --> 12:59.779
-You heard about that?
-Mm-hmm.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.656
No, not yet.

13:01.698 --> 13:04.117
Well, you know,
I could search for him.

13:04.159 --> 13:05.452
Personally.

13:05.494 --> 13:07.746
That's not necessary.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.539
Right.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.502
Hey, did you hear about
the mayor of Baltimore?

13:16.588 --> 13:19.508
Yeah. Yeah.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.134
Heard his plane went down.

13:21.176 --> 13:23.053
Some sort of engine trouble.

13:23.094 --> 13:24.429
Yeah, it's awful.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.722
I saw him on Tuesday.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.432
Had a meeting with him
right here.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.392
Wow.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.770
Well, hug your kids, right?

13:31.811 --> 13:33.939
'Cause you never know
what might happen.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.273
-So true.
-Mm.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.442
You know what's interesting?

13:37.484 --> 13:40.445
The Deep told me, and only me,

13:40.487 --> 13:43.406
that there were, uh,
scorch marks

13:43.448 --> 13:45.951
on the mayor's engine.

13:45.992 --> 13:50.705
Almost as if from two small,
high-intensity beams,

13:50.747 --> 13:52.832
roughly the width of human eyes.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.546
Say what you mean to say.

13:57.587 --> 14:03.051
Your brand is hope,

14:03.093 --> 14:06.763
baseball, America...
sunshine.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.474
You don't do vengeance.

14:11.643 --> 14:15.730
Madelyn, I heard him
through the wall of this--

14:15.772 --> 14:17.190
He was blackmailing you.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.401
I am the last person
you need to save.

14:19.442 --> 14:20.860
Yeah, but I-I did it for you.

14:20.902 --> 14:24.239
I know, but did the timing
occur to you?

14:24.281 --> 14:26.616
I have half the Senate
Appropriations Committee

14:26.658 --> 14:29.869
coming tonight.

14:29.911 --> 14:31.580
(scoffs)

14:42.757 --> 14:46.011
How did he even know
about Compound V?

14:46.052 --> 14:47.804
We are not going
to talk about that.

14:47.846 --> 14:49.431
Oh, come on, Madelyn.

14:49.472 --> 14:52.225
You do not need
to hide things from me.

14:52.267 --> 14:54.019
I love Vought as much as you do,

14:54.060 --> 14:57.188
-and I can do more.
-You can do more?

14:57.230 --> 15:00.692
You've already grossed
$12.3 billion for us.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.320
Right. So the pricks on 82 can
take all the fucking credit?

15:03.361 --> 15:05.739
Empty fucking suits
with Cornell degrees? Come on.

15:05.780 --> 15:09.367
I'm the one who's out there.
Not them.

15:09.409 --> 15:14.914
I'm the one who,
who-who knows the audience.

15:14.956 --> 15:17.208
Who knows what's good
for this company.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.877
I know. I hear you.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.838
I do. But what I need right now,

15:21.880 --> 15:26.176
is I need you to charm the shit
out of those congressmen.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.012
Right.

15:29.054 --> 15:33.224
'Cause that's all
I'm good for, huh?

15:33.266 --> 15:35.852
Smile, look pretty,
say my lines.

15:35.894 --> 15:38.188
Whoop, whoop, whoop.

15:38.229 --> 15:40.815
No. No.

15:42.859 --> 15:47.572
You just need
to let me protect you.

15:47.614 --> 15:51.034
-Oh, you're gonna protect me?
-Mm-hmm.

15:54.120 --> 15:58.500
Gods are pure

15:58.541 --> 16:01.252
and they're perfect

16:01.294 --> 16:03.672
and they're above it all.

16:03.713 --> 16:06.007
And they need to stay that way.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.812
Huh...

16:20.855 --> 16:22.524
You're leaking.

16:23.775 --> 16:25.777
Thank you.

16:28.029 --> 16:30.907
(panting)

16:30.949 --> 16:33.576
(scoffs, chuckles)

16:39.374 --> 16:41.376
(phone chimes)

16:54.806 --> 16:57.767
(sighs)

16:57.809 --> 17:00.186
(line ringing)

17:00.228 --> 17:02.021
-DAD (over phone): Hello?
-Hi, Dad.

17:02.063 --> 17:05.400
Hughie, where have you been?
I've been calling hospitals.

17:05.442 --> 17:07.068
-I'm fine.
-But the police are saying

17:07.110 --> 17:08.570
some wacko drove
into Gary's store,

17:08.611 --> 17:10.405
right through the window,
and then took off.

17:10.447 --> 17:13.116
I-I thought maybe you've been
hurt, or-or kidnapped.

17:13.158 --> 17:15.201
I saw this Dateline
on human trafficking...

17:15.243 --> 17:17.662
Dad, I haven't been
human trafficked, okay?

17:17.704 --> 17:20.165
I-I closed up early. It must
have happened after I left.

17:20.206 --> 17:21.958
But where'd you go?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.919
Just been drinking at Anthony's.

17:24.961 --> 17:27.922
-Blowing off steam.
-No-- now, I called Anthony,
all right?

17:27.964 --> 17:30.633
I called everybody. No one's
seen you. Don't lie to me.

17:30.675 --> 17:33.052
Yeah, it's kind of
hard to explain.

17:33.094 --> 17:35.805
Hey, Dad, listen,
I got to, I got to go.

17:35.847 --> 17:37.223
Just, l-listen,
I know you've been taking

17:37.265 --> 17:38.850
Robin's accident real hard.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.268
-It wasn't an accident.
-All-all right, all right.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.145
My point is, you're a good boy.

17:42.187 --> 17:44.939
You're a sensitive boy.
Come home.

17:44.981 --> 17:48.359
Okay? Before you do something
stupid, come home, Hughie.

17:48.401 --> 17:52.030
-I got to go.
-No, w-wait, Hugh...

17:58.119 --> 18:00.121
(panting)

18:04.584 --> 18:06.586
(grunts)

18:16.346 --> 18:18.348
(panting)

18:32.028 --> 18:35.156
Oh. Well, I heard
we had a meeting.

18:35.198 --> 18:37.826
So, um,
I'll just leave you to it.

18:37.867 --> 18:41.538
Well, we're having a meeting
right now, aren't we, Deep?

18:41.579 --> 18:43.206
You and me.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.627
-Come on in.
-Yeah. Sure.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.815
So, uh, what, uh...

19:08.857 --> 19:11.442
Or is there, is there anything
I can, can do for you,

19:11.484 --> 19:12.902
Homelander?

19:12.944 --> 19:16.573
Well, yeah. I-I guess, uh...

19:16.614 --> 19:18.199
(sighs)

19:18.241 --> 19:20.201
Well, you can help me
understand something, Deep,

19:20.243 --> 19:22.203
'cause, uh...

19:22.245 --> 19:24.831
(chuckles):
I don't know, maybe I'm stupid.

19:24.873 --> 19:27.292
Am I stupid, Deep?

19:27.333 --> 19:29.294
What? No. (scoffs)

19:29.335 --> 19:32.297
No. You're not stupid.
(chuckles)

19:32.338 --> 19:36.092
You're-you're smart.
Very smart, right?

19:36.134 --> 19:37.719
Yeah. Okay.

19:37.760 --> 19:42.140
So, what possible reason--

19:42.181 --> 19:45.977
what, uh, razor-sharp
fish instinct--

19:46.019 --> 19:49.022
made you run to Stillwell

19:49.063 --> 19:51.900
and tell her what you thought
you saw down there?

19:51.941 --> 19:55.111
All right, look, I-I thought--
I thought I, I was, uh...

19:55.153 --> 19:57.780
I-I don't even know-- I don't
know what I saw down there,

19:57.822 --> 20:01.367
as a matter of fact. It was, it
was really dark and, uh, muddy--

20:01.409 --> 20:02.994
the water was really muddy.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.788
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.

20:05.830 --> 20:08.249
I-I didn't...

20:08.291 --> 20:12.253
I didn't really see anything
down there, as a matter of fact.

20:12.295 --> 20:14.297
(chuckles)

20:14.339 --> 20:15.757
That's what I thought.

20:15.798 --> 20:18.009
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

20:18.051 --> 20:20.261
(laughing)

20:24.641 --> 20:26.059
(Homelander chuckles)

20:26.100 --> 20:30.396
And I trust we never have
to have this conversation again.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.815
No. Of course not.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.400
Just this once.

20:36.402 --> 20:39.489
(both chuckle)

20:42.158 --> 20:45.370
Now go fuck Shamu
in the blowhole.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.583
Yeah.

20:58.508 --> 21:01.010
("La foule,"
by Youssoupha playing)

21:35.545 --> 21:39.257
Rounds coated in the same carbon
metamaterial as his skin.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.550
(scoffs)

21:46.556 --> 21:48.516
Will it work?

21:48.558 --> 21:49.892
Je ne sais pas.

21:56.482 --> 21:59.068
(gun clicks)

21:59.110 --> 22:01.154
HUGHIE:
Guys?

22:01.195 --> 22:04.073
What are you doing?
Wait! No, no, no! Wait, wait!

22:04.115 --> 22:05.575
TRANSLUCENT:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:08.327 --> 22:10.621
TRANSLUCENT:
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

22:10.663 --> 22:14.834
(laughing)
You stupid, fucking asshole.

22:14.876 --> 22:17.128
I'm invincible.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.588
You stupid motherfuckers.

22:18.629 --> 22:20.965
(laughs)

22:21.007 --> 22:23.801
I'm fucking Translucent.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.220
I'm indestructible.

22:26.262 --> 22:28.222
It's only a matter of time
before they come for me.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.099
You're fucking dead!

22:34.062 --> 22:37.273
Well, that was great, guys.

22:37.315 --> 22:38.775
That was awesome.

22:40.818 --> 22:43.488
Frenchie, back later.

22:43.529 --> 22:44.822
Where are you going?

22:46.491 --> 22:50.203
Got an idea.
Long shot, might help.

22:50.244 --> 22:52.705
-Now?
-Yeah, well, it's all under
control here, isn't it?

22:52.747 --> 22:54.457
Try not to bugger each other.

23:04.425 --> 23:08.221
Ah, fuck me.

23:08.262 --> 23:09.931
Fuck.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.313
(indistinct chatter)

23:20.775 --> 23:22.610
EMPLOYEE:
Oh. Sorry, Ms. Stillwell.

23:22.652 --> 23:23.653
EMPLOYEE 2:
Oh...

23:25.738 --> 23:27.323
MADELYN:
Are you Anika?

23:27.365 --> 23:29.325
Ms. Stillwell,
I didn't know that you were...

23:29.367 --> 23:30.701
You look really nice.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.370
Thank you.
Could you please show me?

23:32.411 --> 23:35.206
Yeah. We haven't been able
to ping Translucent's chip

23:35.248 --> 23:37.458
-until about five minutes ago.
-Well, where is he?

23:37.500 --> 23:39.085
Jersey City.

23:39.127 --> 23:41.087
What the hell is he doing
in Jersey City?

23:41.129 --> 23:43.881
Uh... well, he's somewhere
in this ten-block area.

23:43.923 --> 23:45.508
MADELYN:
That is the best you can do?

23:45.550 --> 23:47.009
ANIKA: It's possible
the chip's glitching,

23:47.051 --> 23:49.011
-or there's some kind
of interference...
-Okay.

23:49.053 --> 23:52.515
Tell security to search the
area, door-to-door if necessary.

23:52.557 --> 23:54.142
But tell them to be discreet.

23:54.183 --> 23:56.811
He is invisible,
so it shouldn't be that hard.

23:56.853 --> 23:58.146
Okay.

24:00.148 --> 24:02.817
(boat horn blows in distance)

24:02.859 --> 24:05.319
DEEP:
Oh, wow. What a surprise.

24:05.361 --> 24:06.904
A water crime.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.573
Fuck me running. I swear to God,

24:08.614 --> 24:11.075
they only call me when
there's trouble at a dock.

24:11.117 --> 24:15.163
Or a river or a lake, canal.

24:15.204 --> 24:17.707
A jetty.

24:17.748 --> 24:21.711
(chuckles) Fucking idiots.
I could be doing so much more.

24:21.752 --> 24:24.338
But no, Vought just wants me
to make my big pretty dives

24:24.380 --> 24:27.508
into the water and flash
my fucking biceps for Instagram.

24:27.550 --> 24:29.886
I mean, sure, four million hits
a day, but still,

24:29.927 --> 24:32.305
it's fucking demeaning.

24:32.346 --> 24:34.515
(sighs)

24:34.557 --> 24:36.350
What's your problem?

24:36.392 --> 24:38.853
You've had that pissy look
on your face all night.

24:41.397 --> 24:42.565
(electrical buzzing)

24:42.607 --> 24:46.110
Ooh. What...?

24:46.152 --> 24:48.196
Is this about
the other night again?

24:48.237 --> 24:50.364
(scoffs)

24:50.406 --> 24:52.992
Jesus Christ.
(chuckles)

24:53.034 --> 24:54.994
Cry me a fucking river,
all right?

24:55.036 --> 24:57.288
I took my share of shit
when I first got here, okay?

24:57.330 --> 25:01.167
Besides, you had
a crush on me, remember?

25:01.209 --> 25:04.003
That gives you no right--
zero right--

25:04.045 --> 25:06.255
to do what you did,
you pathetic asshole.

25:06.297 --> 25:09.425
-Hey. You shut
your fucking mouth.
-Or what?

25:09.467 --> 25:11.344
You'll sic a grouper on me?

25:11.385 --> 25:13.554
I'll tell everyone
you're a psycho.

25:13.596 --> 25:16.057
-I'll go to Homelander.
-No, you won't.

25:16.098 --> 25:19.352
See, I asked around; you're not
number two around here.

25:19.393 --> 25:21.979
You're just the fish guy.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.315
Everyone thinks you're a joke.

25:24.357 --> 25:26.609
Me, most of all.

25:26.651 --> 25:30.696
I cannot believe
I fell for your crap.

25:30.738 --> 25:35.117
-You stuck-up little...
-You ever touch me again,

25:35.159 --> 25:38.037
I will burn your eyes out.

25:40.456 --> 25:43.042
Understand me?

25:43.084 --> 25:44.919
(sighs)

25:44.961 --> 25:47.213
(clattering)

25:50.925 --> 25:52.885
We'll finish this later.

25:52.927 --> 25:55.680
You take them from the front,
I'll come in from behind.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.233
(exhales)

26:15.199 --> 26:17.201
HOMELANDER DOLL:
I'll always...

26:20.788 --> 26:23.165
STARLIGHT:
Hey.

26:24.208 --> 26:25.459
(grunting)

26:31.132 --> 26:32.550
Hey, boys.

26:38.306 --> 26:39.515
(whoops)

26:39.557 --> 26:42.143
Hurry up. Move faster.

26:42.184 --> 26:44.937
You're amazing. That was so
great. That was really good.

26:44.979 --> 26:47.315
-Smile for the cameras.
-What? What the hell is this?

26:47.356 --> 26:48.816
Yeah, stand over him
and say "This is lit."

26:48.858 --> 26:50.693
DEEP:
Oh, hey, Jimmy.

26:50.735 --> 26:54.238
Catch my dive in the water?
It was fucking cherry.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.406
Nice.

26:57.408 --> 27:00.953
ASHLEY:
Smile at the camera, Starlight.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.915
(alarm beeping)

27:10.504 --> 27:12.798
BUTCHER: Congrats
on your promotion, Susan.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.760
(whispers):
Jesus Christ. Butcher.

27:15.801 --> 27:18.596
-Madam Deputy Director, eh?
-(sighing)

27:18.637 --> 27:22.933
Wow. Andrew and the kids
must be chuffed for you.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.269
Keep your voice down, and don't
talk about my family.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.438
It makes my skin crawl.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.023
What are you doing here?

27:29.065 --> 27:32.735
Just need a quick dekko
at some of your files.

27:32.777 --> 27:36.030
-My files? What files?
-A couple of Supes.

27:36.072 --> 27:38.074
Big Game, Shout Out.

27:38.115 --> 27:40.076
Translucent, if you got him.

27:40.117 --> 27:41.786
-Why Translucent?
-Eh, nothing special,

27:41.827 --> 27:43.871
-just ticking a few boxes.
-Oh.

27:43.913 --> 27:45.790
So you just broke
into my goddamn house

27:45.831 --> 27:47.041
in the middle of the night?

27:47.083 --> 27:48.584
All right.

27:48.626 --> 27:50.836
I'm trying to find a way
to do the job on the cunt,

27:50.878 --> 27:52.755
and if it's anywhere,
it'll be in Mallory's files.

27:52.797 --> 27:55.049
-Now would you like me
to keep talking?
-No.

27:55.091 --> 27:59.220
No. Christ. Just don't
fucking say another word.

27:59.261 --> 28:01.764
The Mallory files
are dead and buried.

28:01.806 --> 28:04.308
You're the deputy director
of CIA Operations.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.143
-Dig 'em up.
-No.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.396
-Why not?
-Because of you.

28:08.437 --> 28:10.147
-Me?
-Yes, you.

28:10.189 --> 28:11.982
The director will shitcan anyone

28:12.024 --> 28:13.609
who even goes near those files.

28:13.651 --> 28:17.696
You made it suicide
to go after the Supes.

28:17.738 --> 28:21.325
What are you even doing back
involved in this?

28:21.367 --> 28:23.244
I mean, you have a death wish,

28:23.285 --> 28:26.038
or are you a glutton
for punishment?

28:26.080 --> 28:29.500
Yeah. A bit of both, I suppose.

28:35.965 --> 28:38.509
Come on... Susan.

28:38.551 --> 28:41.554
Five minutes alone
with a piece of paper.

28:41.595 --> 28:44.348
For old time's sakes.
No one will know.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.310
You-You're really trying
to sell this shit?

28:48.352 --> 28:51.147
-Why, you buying it?
-You think I look back fondly

28:51.188 --> 28:54.692
at the times we fucked
in bar bathrooms?

28:54.733 --> 28:56.777
Oh, come on.
We had a few laughs.

28:56.819 --> 28:59.864
Like the time you sent me
the Edible Arrangement.

28:59.905 --> 29:02.491
And what we had was
you trying to use me,

29:02.533 --> 29:05.453
for a Get Out of Jail Free card
at a time like this.

29:05.494 --> 29:08.080
Well, if that's all
it was, then,

29:08.122 --> 29:10.082
what's got you
so hot and bothered

29:10.124 --> 29:13.210
when a simple "fuck you"
would suffice?

29:14.462 --> 29:16.213
Fuck you.

29:18.340 --> 29:20.551
Now get out of my house.

29:30.853 --> 29:33.689
Did I mention this is
life or death?

29:33.731 --> 29:36.734
I'll send an Edible Arrangement
to your funeral.

29:57.755 --> 30:00.716
Hi.

30:00.758 --> 30:03.928
I, um... I thought you
might be thirsty, so...

30:16.190 --> 30:18.150
Well, if you don't want it,
I can always...

30:18.192 --> 30:19.401
No, I want it.

30:24.823 --> 30:28.744
Cheers.

30:28.786 --> 30:31.747
(gulping)

30:31.789 --> 30:33.165
HUGHIE:
So, listen, um,

30:33.207 --> 30:37.586
I need to ask you some
questions about A-Train.

30:37.628 --> 30:41.173
When he, uh, burst
through that woman

30:41.215 --> 30:45.344
the other day, Robin Ward.

30:45.386 --> 30:47.012
I-I need to know why.

30:47.054 --> 30:49.056
Where was he going?
What was he doing?

30:49.098 --> 30:51.475
Why? Was she your sister?

30:51.517 --> 30:54.144
Girlfriend?

30:54.186 --> 30:55.396
Girlfriend.

30:55.437 --> 30:57.231
(sighs)

30:57.273 --> 30:59.567
That's what all this
is about? Christ.

30:59.608 --> 31:01.443
What makes you think I know
anything about it?

31:01.485 --> 31:02.778
I know you and A-Train
were tight.

31:02.820 --> 31:03.988
You guys came up together.

31:04.029 --> 31:06.615
What are you, a fucking fan?

31:06.657 --> 31:10.953
Listen, those two guys in there,
they want to kill you, okay?

31:10.995 --> 31:12.830
So you give me something,
maybe I can...

31:12.871 --> 31:15.291
What? Hold 'em off?
'Cause they hang

31:15.332 --> 31:17.501
on your every word.
You're the big man around here.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.712
Okay, you don't want to talk,
don't talk. I tried.

31:19.753 --> 31:20.921
Good luck.

31:20.963 --> 31:24.592
Buddy, my superpower
ain't invisibility.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.051
You know that, right?

31:28.262 --> 31:30.973
It's reading people.

31:31.015 --> 31:32.850
Watching them when
they think they're alone.

31:45.321 --> 31:47.031
I see people for who
they really are.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.533
I see you, too, pal.

31:49.575 --> 31:50.784
Right.

31:50.826 --> 31:52.870
'Cause you know me
so well, right?

31:52.911 --> 31:54.330
Yeah. I know you're trying
your damnedest

31:54.371 --> 31:57.458
to be tough--
it's a little adorable--

31:57.499 --> 32:02.004
but the truth is...
you're terrified.

32:02.046 --> 32:05.007
Shitting in your tighty-whities

32:05.049 --> 32:09.261
'cause you're "in over your head
fucked," and you know it.

32:18.020 --> 32:20.814
(indistinct radio transmission)

32:32.076 --> 32:33.243
TRANSLUCENT:
Hughie,

32:33.285 --> 32:36.455
I even kind of feel for you.

32:36.497 --> 32:40.751
Your girl died, and we do crazy
shit when we got broken hearts,

32:40.793 --> 32:43.170
but now every instinct
is screaming at you

32:43.212 --> 32:46.090
to head for the hills, and you
should listen to that instinct.

32:48.133 --> 32:50.177
Unless we kill you first.

32:50.219 --> 32:52.596
How?

32:52.638 --> 32:54.598
I got invulnerable skin.

32:54.640 --> 32:58.602
I'm a fucking superhero, guy.

32:58.644 --> 33:01.939
We fight gangs and terrorists.

33:01.980 --> 33:05.442
We save the world daily.

33:05.484 --> 33:08.946
I've stood in front
of thousands of screaming fans,

33:08.987 --> 33:11.990
all of 'em creaming their jeans.

33:12.032 --> 33:13.492
Uh...

33:13.534 --> 33:14.910
Who are you?

33:14.952 --> 33:19.415
A water balloon filled

33:19.456 --> 33:24.378
(laughing):
with blood and meat.

33:24.420 --> 33:27.589
Homelander's gonna find me,
and when he does,

33:27.631 --> 33:29.216
he's gonna burst you wide open.

33:29.258 --> 33:31.093
I'm gonna make it home
in time for cocktails.

33:31.135 --> 33:34.179
'Cause that's who you are,
and that's who I am.

33:34.221 --> 33:38.600
You're not the hero
of this story.

33:38.642 --> 33:42.396
And I'm not the one

33:42.438 --> 33:44.440
who's trapped.

33:49.403 --> 33:52.072
Well, good luck.

33:52.114 --> 33:54.116
I tried.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.202
TRANSLUCENT:
Great chat.

33:58.704 --> 34:00.873
Run for the hills, Hughie.

34:07.963 --> 34:09.173
MAN (over radio):
It looks like we're losing him.

34:09.214 --> 34:11.508
The signal's going in and out.

34:15.345 --> 34:17.306
MAN 2 (over radio):
Keep searching,

34:17.347 --> 34:19.349
another 50 feet down
on the right.

34:24.229 --> 34:26.231
(shuddering)

34:53.759 --> 34:56.053
EZEKIEL: Because,
thanks to Samaritan's Embrace,

34:56.094 --> 34:57.554
Asim has a bed,

34:57.596 --> 35:00.432
a ventilated cooking area,
and a laptop.

35:00.474 --> 35:03.268
But our work is not done.
There are millions more children

35:03.310 --> 35:05.938
just like Asim,
who need your help.

35:05.979 --> 35:08.106
For just $9.99 a month.
That is only...

35:08.148 --> 35:11.151
Hi, John.
Thanks for your support.

35:13.153 --> 35:15.405
It's what makes this republic
so great.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.908
Bill. How are the kids?
(chuckles)

35:17.950 --> 35:19.576
Hey.

35:19.618 --> 35:22.079
EZEKIEL: Give
to Samaritan's Embrace today,

35:22.120 --> 35:23.914
and give a child
just like Asim...

35:23.956 --> 35:25.457
Could I get a club soda?

35:25.499 --> 35:27.167
Ms. Stillwell.

35:27.209 --> 35:30.420
Senator, what can I get you?

35:30.462 --> 35:33.924
-Jack, rocks.
-You know, we have Macallan 25.

35:33.966 --> 35:36.552
You'd be wasting it.
Whiskey's whiskey to me.

35:36.593 --> 35:38.428
(chuckles)

35:38.470 --> 35:41.098
Boy, they're blowing
so much smoke up Maeve's ass,

35:41.139 --> 35:44.685
it's a miracle she doesn't die
of lung cancer.

35:44.726 --> 35:46.186
(laughs)

35:46.228 --> 35:48.939
But you know it's just that,
right? Smoke.

35:48.981 --> 35:51.066
-I'm sorry?
-Everyone loves

35:51.108 --> 35:55.028
to bask in their glow,
but tomorrow morning

35:55.070 --> 35:58.448
no one's putting Supes
into national defense.

35:58.490 --> 36:01.368
It won't get out of committee,
much less hit the floor.

36:01.410 --> 36:03.161
Because God forbid
we could have an advantage

36:03.203 --> 36:04.538
in an armed conflict.

36:04.580 --> 36:07.332
You send a Supe over
the 38th parallel,

36:07.374 --> 36:09.042
Pyongyang's gonna answer
with a nuke.

36:09.084 --> 36:10.919
Then one of my guys
will catch it.

36:10.961 --> 36:14.506
You see Robertson over there?

36:14.548 --> 36:17.801
He's got Lockheed in his state
and in his pocket.

36:17.843 --> 36:22.764
McCrea? He's got Fort Bragg
and its couple thousand voters.

36:22.806 --> 36:26.852
No one wants
to outsource to you.

36:26.894 --> 36:29.104
America runs on weapons.

36:29.146 --> 36:31.523
Hell, it's one of the only
damn things we still make.

36:31.565 --> 36:33.734
But you are the chairman.

36:33.775 --> 36:34.735
Where do you stand?

36:34.776 --> 36:36.612
Me? I'm just an old leatherneck.

36:36.653 --> 36:38.280
And if I was on the line,

36:38.322 --> 36:41.658
scare the shit out of me
to have Homelander there.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.119
My heroes are the most
loyal, patriotic...

36:44.161 --> 36:45.370
That's just it.

36:45.412 --> 36:49.458
They're your heroes,
aren't they?

36:53.420 --> 36:55.005
Get him a Macallan 25.

36:55.047 --> 36:57.132
(chuckles)

36:57.174 --> 37:02.095
Why have average
when you can have extraordinary?

37:02.137 --> 37:04.973
(chuckles)

37:08.852 --> 37:10.562
Thank you.

37:10.604 --> 37:12.064
(indistinct chatter)

37:12.105 --> 37:13.899
WOMAN: Guys, we should get
back to the party.

37:13.941 --> 37:15.651
-MAN: What?
-Elena just ordered more booze.

37:15.692 --> 37:16.944
-Come on, let's go back.
-No, no...

37:16.985 --> 37:18.028
WOMAN:
It'll be more fun at the party.

37:18.070 --> 37:19.237
Please-- okay, don't touch me.

37:19.279 --> 37:21.073
-(laughs)
-No, please, please.

37:21.114 --> 37:23.575
Oh, no, no! Stop!
No, no, no, no!

37:23.617 --> 37:24.701
Please, no, no, no, no!

37:24.743 --> 37:27.120
-The girl said no.
-Help.

37:27.162 --> 37:28.789
We're all friends here.

37:28.830 --> 37:31.208
Yeah, it's all good.
It's fine. (laughs)

37:39.216 --> 37:42.803
Miss, do me a favor
and shut your eyes.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.306
Fucking bitch.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.225
(grunting)

38:01.613 --> 38:03.490
(drilling)

38:04.533 --> 38:07.077
Fucking diamond skin.

38:07.119 --> 38:08.787
(door slams)

38:08.829 --> 38:10.330
-Fuck.
-Merde!

38:17.295 --> 38:18.630
Here.

38:19.673 --> 38:21.591
Here, take it.

38:21.633 --> 38:24.094
What is that?

38:24.136 --> 38:26.346
It will help
with your, uh, anxiety.

38:26.388 --> 38:29.307
It's LSD and MDMA.
This is a candy flip.

38:29.349 --> 38:30.767
It'll smooth you right out.
Take it.

38:30.809 --> 38:33.061
Uh, thank you, but I-I
don't think now is the time

38:33.103 --> 38:35.856
for a major hallucinogen.

38:35.897 --> 38:38.900
Fais-toi plaisir.

38:41.862 --> 38:43.864
(sniffs, coughs)

38:48.326 --> 38:50.704
What are you exactly?

38:50.746 --> 38:54.374
Chemist? Engineer? What?

38:54.416 --> 38:58.503
No. I know a little
about a lot of things.

38:58.545 --> 39:02.299
I'm a gunrunner by trade,
but, uh, as you can see,

39:02.340 --> 39:04.134
I've developed a certain niche.

39:04.176 --> 39:05.719
Killing superheroes?

39:05.761 --> 39:08.055
No.

39:08.096 --> 39:11.183
You can count on one hand
the number of dead superheroes.

39:11.224 --> 39:14.227
Sometimes you can, uh,
incapacitate them.

39:17.064 --> 39:20.358
Truly, they are
magnificent creatures.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.694
Mm.

39:22.736 --> 39:25.781
Each one with a unique power
that requires a unique solution.

39:25.822 --> 39:29.451
It's, uh...
it's never the same twice.

39:29.493 --> 39:31.203
Who pays you to do that?

39:31.244 --> 39:33.538
Whoever can pay.

39:35.582 --> 39:39.127
And when you do kill a Supe--

39:39.169 --> 39:41.463
or, you know, any-anyone--

39:41.505 --> 39:45.342
um... what's it like?

39:51.973 --> 39:55.143
You know... (sniffs)

39:55.185 --> 39:58.230
I saw this woman once,
in a midtown elevator,

39:58.271 --> 40:01.191
2008.

40:01.233 --> 40:03.902
No more for ten seconds,
I see her, huh?

40:03.944 --> 40:05.946
Stunning.

40:05.987 --> 40:07.614
Five-nine.

40:09.157 --> 40:12.285
Hair so black it absorbed
the light, you know?

40:12.327 --> 40:15.872
Tom Ford pencil skirt,
Louboutin stilettos.

40:15.914 --> 40:17.457
C'est magnifique.

40:17.499 --> 40:19.835
But she had,

40:19.876 --> 40:22.462
uh... she had--

40:22.504 --> 40:25.465
I never forget this, you see--

40:25.507 --> 40:28.301
she had dirt
under her fingernails

40:28.343 --> 40:31.304
and callouses on her hands,
and I see this and I say, "Oh,

40:31.346 --> 40:33.849
strange for such a refined woman
like this."

40:33.890 --> 40:35.100
What, you...
(chuckles)

40:35.142 --> 40:36.143
You a gardener?

40:36.184 --> 40:37.227
You know, are you a sculptor?

40:37.269 --> 40:39.146
What is this, huh?

40:39.187 --> 40:42.858
And I think about this...

40:46.486 --> 40:48.655
I think about her all the time.

40:50.991 --> 40:53.160
She was the first person
I ever killed.

40:58.039 --> 40:59.207
I carry...

40:59.249 --> 41:02.502
I carry them all with me.

41:02.544 --> 41:06.423
It's like scars in a way,
you know?

41:12.470 --> 41:15.265
-Okay, Senator, you ready?

41:15.307 --> 41:16.266
(chuckles)

41:16.308 --> 41:17.976
Oh, yeah.

41:18.018 --> 41:21.855
Oh. (chuckles) Oh, darling.

41:21.897 --> 41:24.149
-Mm-hmm?
-You know I like to watch.

41:24.191 --> 41:26.776
No. Can't always be in control.

41:26.818 --> 41:29.571
-(chuckles)
-Sir.

41:29.613 --> 41:32.532
Then I guess I'll just have
to feel my way through it.

41:32.574 --> 41:35.577
Oh, you'll feel
good indeed, baby.

41:40.874 --> 41:43.752
-You ready?
-Oh, I was born ready.

41:43.793 --> 41:47.214
-Mm-hmm.
-Feels like butter, baby.

41:47.255 --> 41:48.632
Get ready, sir.

41:48.673 --> 41:50.717
You're going in.

41:50.759 --> 41:52.219
Yee-haw!

41:52.260 --> 41:53.845
Giddyup, gal. Come on.

41:53.887 --> 41:54.971
-Oh, God.
-(laughing)

41:55.013 --> 41:57.557
That-that feels different.

41:57.599 --> 41:59.601
(elevator bell dings)

42:10.779 --> 42:12.989
Hey...

42:13.031 --> 42:14.866
Homelander.

42:14.908 --> 42:17.285
Starlight.

42:17.327 --> 42:19.329
How are you?

42:21.122 --> 42:24.084
Uh, I'm good.

42:24.125 --> 42:26.670
Good.

42:26.711 --> 42:30.507
Hey, is that your, uh,
secret identity?

42:30.548 --> 42:33.385
-Mm-hmm.
-Charming.

42:33.426 --> 42:34.594
Thanks.

42:34.636 --> 42:37.931
Yeah, I-I gave up on mine...

42:37.973 --> 42:41.685
oh... a long time ago now.

42:42.727 --> 42:44.813
I think I'm gonna go to sleep.

42:44.854 --> 42:46.564
(chuckles)

42:46.606 --> 42:48.608
Good night.

42:58.326 --> 43:01.413
MADELYN:
No. No, I did not

43:01.454 --> 43:04.207
go through eight rounds of IVF

43:04.249 --> 43:06.960
and bleeding nipples
to quit now.

43:07.002 --> 43:10.088
I am doing this. Yes.

43:10.130 --> 43:12.716
That little kid is gonna drink
my goddamn milk

43:12.757 --> 43:14.509
if it's the last thing I do.

43:14.551 --> 43:16.553
(pump whirring)

43:23.893 --> 43:26.563
(narrator speaking indistinctly
over TV)

43:26.604 --> 43:27.856
(drill whirring)

43:36.823 --> 43:38.533
(drill clatters on table)

43:38.575 --> 43:41.578
NARRATOR: While scientists
now believe the shell evolved

43:41.619 --> 43:44.998
to help turtles burrow
underground...

43:59.679 --> 44:00.764
What are you doing?

44:00.805 --> 44:02.974
Shocking our invisible friend.

44:03.016 --> 44:05.477
I need him unconscious.

44:05.518 --> 44:06.936
Why?

44:08.605 --> 44:10.231
Because I got it.

44:11.691 --> 44:13.443
TRANSLUCENT:
Now what the fuck do you want?

44:13.485 --> 44:16.488
-(electricity crackles)
-(Translucent screams)

44:17.822 --> 44:19.783
What the fuck, Starlight?!

44:19.824 --> 44:21.493
-What?
-(spits)

44:21.534 --> 44:24.079
(grunting over phone)

44:26.915 --> 44:28.958
-Oh, shit.
-Yeah.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.377
Oh, shit.

44:30.418 --> 44:32.253
And so glad you did it
in plain clothes,

44:32.295 --> 44:34.297
so you could blow
your secret identity.

44:34.339 --> 44:38.802
Here: "OMG. I recognize
Starlight, that's Annie January!

44:38.843 --> 44:40.428
"I went to Hoover High with her.

44:40.470 --> 44:43.181
#SheWasBulimic."

44:43.223 --> 44:45.767
(clears throat)

44:45.809 --> 44:48.395
One, this was stupid.

44:48.436 --> 44:52.649
Two, it was really stupid
to do it on camera.

44:52.690 --> 44:54.401
Always look for cameras.

44:54.442 --> 44:56.778
-They were about to rape a girl.
-What girl?

44:56.820 --> 44:58.696
There's no girl in that video.
You get a name?

44:58.738 --> 44:59.864
No, she ran off.

44:59.906 --> 45:01.658
Oh, great. She ran off. Great.

45:01.699 --> 45:04.244
Always get a fucking name,
Starlight. Always!

45:04.285 --> 45:05.995
Well, uh...
They-they said... Hmm.

45:06.037 --> 45:08.832
(stammering):
They-they said she was a friend.

45:08.873 --> 45:10.250
It was date rape, I think.

45:10.291 --> 45:12.293
Great.
Well, she hasn't come forward

45:12.335 --> 45:14.129
and, statistically,
she's not likely to.

45:14.170 --> 45:16.631
So all we really have
is two Delta Betas

45:16.673 --> 45:18.716
who insist they were just
getting drunk in an alley

45:18.758 --> 45:21.636
until you beat them unconscious.

45:21.678 --> 45:23.430
They're lying! I, uh...

45:23.471 --> 45:26.182
Aren't I innocent
until proven guilty?

45:26.224 --> 45:29.060
When you're in the big leagues?
You flip it.

45:30.895 --> 45:32.647
(exhales)

45:32.689 --> 45:34.357
I don't know what you were
planning on doing today, hmm,

45:34.399 --> 45:36.484
with your little... cute day,

45:36.526 --> 45:38.319
but you have to cancel
everything, okay?

45:38.361 --> 45:39.821
You're gonna have meetings
with Risk Assessment,

45:39.863 --> 45:42.115
with Crisis Management,
with Legal.

45:42.157 --> 45:45.034
Jerry is gonna lose his shit!

45:45.076 --> 45:46.744
Fuck.

45:46.786 --> 45:48.746
Am...

45:48.788 --> 45:50.123
(Starlight exhales)

45:50.165 --> 45:51.958
Are they gonna fire me?

45:52.000 --> 45:55.295
Just be in Stillwell's office
at 10:00.

45:55.336 --> 45:57.005
What?

45:57.046 --> 45:59.090
Am I fired?

45:59.132 --> 46:02.343
Senator, I very much appreciate
you coming bright and early.

46:02.385 --> 46:06.514
I realize, uh,
how busy you were last night.

46:14.647 --> 46:16.733
These... are fake.

46:16.774 --> 46:18.526
I think we both know
they're not.

46:20.570 --> 46:23.698
Look. I was with a young woman,
all right?

46:23.740 --> 46:25.241
Of legal age.

46:25.283 --> 46:26.618
Her name was Rhonda.

46:26.659 --> 46:29.162
So this isn't possible.

46:29.204 --> 46:31.623
They've... (scoffs) ...obviously
been doctored or something.

46:31.664 --> 46:33.374
I'm sorry, they are authentic.

46:33.416 --> 46:35.710
I should know. I was there.

46:35.752 --> 46:37.504
You what?

46:38.755 --> 46:40.757
(squishing and cracking)

46:44.802 --> 46:46.763
You shiver when you orgasm, sir.

46:46.804 --> 46:48.431
Oh, Jesus.

46:48.473 --> 46:49.849
(door opens)

46:49.891 --> 46:52.644
That will be all, Doppelganger.

46:52.685 --> 46:54.687
Who the fuck is he?

46:54.729 --> 46:56.648
Anyway, I would love to continue

46:56.689 --> 46:59.692
our conversation
from last night.

46:59.734 --> 47:02.862
This is some dirty fucking pool,
Madelyn.

47:02.904 --> 47:05.573
You're really gonna clutch
your pearls, Senator?

47:05.615 --> 47:09.452
I don't think either one of us
is that naive.

47:09.494 --> 47:11.829
Yeah. It's not...

47:11.871 --> 47:14.958
it's not fatal to be...
homosexual these days.

47:14.999 --> 47:17.043
It is in Oklahoma, sir.

47:17.085 --> 47:19.087
Where your voters live.

47:21.005 --> 47:23.424
Even if I get the bill
out of committee,

47:23.466 --> 47:26.094
nobody's gonna vote for it
on the floor.

47:26.135 --> 47:29.138
No one wants your fucking Supes
in the Army.

47:30.640 --> 47:32.183
We'll see.

47:35.687 --> 47:37.647
-(door opens)
-MAN: Shut up, shut up, shut up.

47:37.689 --> 47:39.691
(indistinct low chatter)

47:42.277 --> 47:44.529
ANIKA:
Homelander. (chuckles)

47:44.571 --> 47:47.615
Uh...
wel-welcome to Crime Analytics.

47:47.657 --> 47:49.242
-(Homelander sighs)
-Can... Would you like
a Red Bull?

47:49.284 --> 47:50.743
Have you found Translucent yet?

47:50.785 --> 47:53.288
Oh. Uh, no.
But Security's on it.

47:53.329 --> 47:57.333
He's been missing over 24 hours.

47:57.375 --> 47:59.794
-Is he in danger?
-Um...

47:59.836 --> 48:01.838
Do... you even know?

48:04.090 --> 48:05.425
Forget it. I'll find him myself.

48:05.466 --> 48:06.843
What's his last known position,
please?

48:06.884 --> 48:08.970
Why don't I just call
Ms. Stillwell?

48:09.012 --> 48:10.555
-And I...
-No.

48:10.597 --> 48:11.848
No, no, no, no, no.

48:11.889 --> 48:13.141
You're talking to me.

48:13.182 --> 48:15.977
Well, I'm not sure

48:16.019 --> 48:17.812
-I'm supposed
to be talking to...
-(sighs)

48:17.854 --> 48:20.148
What's your name?

48:20.189 --> 48:21.357
-Anika.
-Anika.

48:21.399 --> 48:22.483
Sir.

48:22.525 --> 48:23.693
It's a beautiful name.

48:23.735 --> 48:24.736
(Anika chuckles)

48:24.777 --> 48:26.738
Listen, Anika.

48:26.779 --> 48:28.865
-(quietly): I'm the Homelander.
-Mm-hmm.

48:28.906 --> 48:31.784
And I can do whatever
the fuck I want. (chuckles)

48:31.826 --> 48:34.037
Okay?

48:34.078 --> 48:35.788
Now...

48:35.830 --> 48:39.459
Translucent's last known
position.

48:40.877 --> 48:42.879
Please.

48:45.506 --> 48:47.508
(typing)

48:51.512 --> 48:53.056
TRANSLUCENT:
What the...?

48:53.097 --> 48:54.057
Something doesn't feel right.

48:54.098 --> 48:55.391
Oh, I'll bet.

48:55.433 --> 48:56.976
FRENCHIE:
I'm not ashamed to admit

48:57.018 --> 48:59.020
I have outdone myself.

49:03.107 --> 49:04.984
Now, the problem is
the skin, no?

49:05.026 --> 49:07.070
It's, uh, hard like diamonds.

49:07.111 --> 49:10.365
But then I realized, it is just
your shell that is hard, huh?

49:10.406 --> 49:12.867
Like a turtle.

49:12.909 --> 49:14.702
But your insides...

49:14.744 --> 49:17.121
they're like the rest of ours...

49:17.163 --> 49:18.539
soft.

49:18.581 --> 49:21.793
So, how do you get to the...
squishy insides?

49:21.834 --> 49:23.044
Through the mouth? Non.

49:23.086 --> 49:25.880
The stomach acid,
the gag reflex.

49:25.922 --> 49:30.426
If I stick something down your
throat, you may vomit it up.

49:30.468 --> 49:32.220
(clicks tongue)

49:32.261 --> 49:33.638
There's truly only one way...

49:33.680 --> 49:35.973
The fuck did you do to me?

49:36.015 --> 49:39.769
He stuck a lump of plastique
up your bum, son.

49:39.811 --> 49:42.146
Ass bomb.

49:43.648 --> 49:45.650
Oh, my God.

49:48.986 --> 49:50.738
Now...

49:50.780 --> 49:54.534
you stick a little finger up
there and try and fish it out--

49:54.575 --> 49:56.911
bang.

49:56.953 --> 50:00.289
I trigger this-- also bang.

50:00.331 --> 50:01.708
Savvy?

50:01.749 --> 50:04.669
(crying):
Oh, please don't kill me.

50:04.711 --> 50:06.337
I'll do anything.

50:06.379 --> 50:10.091
(stammering):
I'll tell you about A-Train.

50:10.133 --> 50:11.759
That's what the kid wants,
right?

50:11.801 --> 50:14.303
I-I-I-I don't know
where A-Train was going

50:14.345 --> 50:15.680
that night he killed the girl,

50:15.722 --> 50:17.557
okay, but I know
where he was coming from.

50:17.598 --> 50:18.725
What? Where?

50:18.766 --> 50:20.393
Popclaw's.

50:20.435 --> 50:22.854
He fucking... loves her.

50:22.895 --> 50:24.605
He doesn't think anyone else
knows, but I know.

50:24.647 --> 50:25.815
I know a lot of things.

50:25.857 --> 50:27.400
But he-he's there every night.

50:27.442 --> 50:29.736
Maybe... now, even.

50:29.777 --> 50:31.028
Popclaw?
That's the hero with the...

50:31.070 --> 50:32.989
the sharp things
coming out of her arms.

50:33.030 --> 50:34.532
Yeah. Real D-lister.

50:34.574 --> 50:36.617
Anyone knows what A-Train
was doing, it's Popclaw.

50:36.659 --> 50:39.036
But that's all I know
about that, I swear to Christ.

50:39.078 --> 50:41.330
But I'll tell you
anything else you want.

50:41.372 --> 50:43.416
Just ask.

50:48.254 --> 50:49.922
TRANSLUCENT:
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

50:49.964 --> 50:52.925
Just... ask anything.

50:52.967 --> 50:57.054
Now, normally, that would be
just what the doctor ordered.

50:57.096 --> 51:00.308
But unfortunately-- for you--

51:00.349 --> 51:02.185
we're out of time.

51:02.226 --> 51:03.978
No.

51:04.020 --> 51:05.188
No!

51:05.229 --> 51:07.398
Please! Listen, I know shit.

51:07.440 --> 51:09.525
Dark shit!
All the way to the top!

51:09.567 --> 51:11.611
Wait, wait! No, no, no, no, no!
Please, wait, wait, wait.

51:11.652 --> 51:13.613
Listen, I can help you.
I'm fucking invisible!

51:13.654 --> 51:15.114
-We can be a team.
-FRENCHIE: Butcher!

51:15.156 --> 51:16.532
No, please, please, please!
Please, I can...

51:16.574 --> 51:18.284
A moment, s'il vous plait.

51:18.326 --> 51:20.328
(Translucent continues
indistinctly)

51:22.622 --> 51:23.623
Here.

51:25.124 --> 51:26.125
HUGHIE:
What is that?

51:27.877 --> 51:29.295
Homelander.

51:29.337 --> 51:31.589
HUGHIE:
That's Homelander?

51:31.631 --> 51:33.674
Homelander's here? Oh, shit.

51:33.716 --> 51:35.426
Oh, shit!

51:35.468 --> 51:36.928
(exhales)

51:36.969 --> 51:38.846
He could see us.

51:38.888 --> 51:41.098
He's got X-ray vision. He can
see through the fucking roof.

51:41.140 --> 51:43.142
And super fucking hearing.

51:43.184 --> 51:45.978
You pull that detonator,
he will hear.

51:52.485 --> 51:54.904
Homelander.

51:54.946 --> 51:57.198
We got to throw him
off the scent.

51:57.240 --> 51:58.199
But how?

51:58.241 --> 52:00.576
Pittsburgh.

52:00.618 --> 52:02.453
Oh, you cannot be serious, huh?

52:02.495 --> 52:04.497
Deadly.

52:04.539 --> 52:06.958
FRENCHIE: You know how much
this will cost me?

52:06.999 --> 52:08.584
Put it on the tab.

52:17.301 --> 52:19.136
Guys?!

52:26.143 --> 52:28.145
Where is it?

52:28.187 --> 52:30.106
Back door panel.

52:33.651 --> 52:35.152
(line ringing)

52:38.489 --> 52:40.449
-Look, the mall shooting's
a tragedy.
-(phone ringing)

52:40.491 --> 52:42.159
I'm just saying,
if more people were armed,

52:42.201 --> 52:44.704
maybe I wouldn't have
to save the day every time.

52:44.745 --> 52:46.080
-NEWSMAN: So, in a situation...
-(sighs) Hello?

52:46.122 --> 52:47.081
FRENCHIE:
Cherie.

52:47.123 --> 52:48.082
It's a burn.

52:48.124 --> 52:49.750
You're joking.

52:49.792 --> 52:51.085
Now?

52:51.127 --> 52:52.169
No joke, I'm afraid.

52:52.211 --> 52:54.964
(sighs)

52:55.006 --> 52:57.258
Fine.

52:57.300 --> 52:59.969
I'll be ready in three.
(exhales)

53:02.263 --> 53:03.764
BUTCHER:
Come on.

53:03.806 --> 53:05.308
Frenchie, I'm getting
shit reception here.

53:05.349 --> 53:06.392
Well, figure it the fuck out,
huh?

53:10.187 --> 53:12.148
Come on.

53:33.502 --> 53:35.421
(knocking)

53:43.220 --> 53:45.222
HOMELANDER:
Evening.

53:46.724 --> 53:48.309
Holy shit.

53:48.351 --> 53:49.685
You're the Homelander.

53:49.727 --> 53:50.895
I am talking to the Homelander.

53:50.937 --> 53:51.979
Mm-hmm.

53:52.021 --> 53:53.856
Sir, I need to see some ID.

53:56.108 --> 53:57.818
Get the fuck back in that cage.

53:57.860 --> 54:00.154
Just take it easy. Okay?

54:00.196 --> 54:01.781
HOMELANDER:
You doing out here?

54:01.822 --> 54:03.741
This is my place.

54:03.783 --> 54:07.119
We-- I'm, uh...
I'm opening a Fogo de Chao.

54:07.161 --> 54:09.163
You know what a churrascaria is?

54:09.205 --> 54:11.082
Yeah.
It's a Brazilian steakhouse.

54:11.123 --> 54:14.377
Sir, I need to see
in the back of the van.

54:14.418 --> 54:16.963
No offense, you got a...
warrant or something?

54:19.465 --> 54:20.883
Well, if you got nothing
back there,

54:20.925 --> 54:22.343
then you got nothing
to worry about, right?

54:22.385 --> 54:23.761
(Frenchie chuckles)

54:28.140 --> 54:29.892
Please get back in the cage.

54:30.977 --> 54:32.895
I'm not getting back
in that cage, man.

54:32.937 --> 54:34.647
I do, I am dead.

54:34.689 --> 54:37.984
Yeah, well, if you don't...
you're dead.

55:03.009 --> 55:04.218
TRANSLUCENT:
Just think.

55:04.260 --> 55:05.845
You kill me,

55:05.886 --> 55:09.724
they'll never stop
looking for you.

55:09.765 --> 55:13.310
You'll be glancing over
your shoulder your whole life

55:13.352 --> 55:15.771
till they find you,
which they will.

55:28.117 --> 55:29.410
(distant explosion)

55:29.452 --> 55:30.536
FRENCHIE:
Everything all right, sir?

55:51.932 --> 55:54.977
Look, you let me go...

55:55.019 --> 55:59.398
you'll be the hero
that saved Translucent.

55:59.440 --> 56:01.817
It's not too late.

56:01.859 --> 56:04.612
You can still go home.

56:04.653 --> 56:07.782
Back to your life.

56:11.744 --> 56:13.287
(detonator safety clicks)

56:13.329 --> 56:15.331
Attaboy.
