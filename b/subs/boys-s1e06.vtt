Obviously, a lot of it's temp.

00:59.685 --> 01:00.603
I love it.

01:00.644 --> 01:01.729
If we're airing on TLC

01:01.771 --> 01:03.647
between My 600-lb Life

01:03.689 --> 01:05.149
and Little People, Big World.

01:05.191 --> 01:06.317
But we're not.

01:06.358 --> 01:08.986
'Cause we're not
cheap reality garbage.

01:09.028 --> 01:11.447
Sorry, Courtenay,
I thought, um--

01:11.489 --> 01:13.699
I-I was trying to go for
something a bit more personable,

01:13.741 --> 01:16.035
-down-to-earth.
-Not this down-to-earth.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.037
I need them to look like
someone you'd want in the Army.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.040
We here are not
fucking Heidi and Spencer.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.460
We are The Seven, James.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.962
And why isn't there anything
on Starlight?

01:27.004 --> 01:29.590
She actually hasn't really made
herself available to the crew.

01:29.632 --> 01:31.634
Where the hell is she?

01:31.675 --> 01:34.136
Has a heavenly body
lost her luster?

01:34.178 --> 01:36.305
Two weeks after
Starlight's shocking appearance

01:36.347 --> 01:37.765
at the Believe Expo...

01:37.807 --> 01:39.350
Social media is still buzzing

01:39.391 --> 01:41.185
about her controversial speech.

01:41.227 --> 01:42.728
Was it a breakdown

01:42.770 --> 01:44.480
-or a triumph?
-Of course,

01:44.522 --> 01:46.315
my thoughts are with Starlight,

01:46.357 --> 01:49.401
and, uh,
I support her in every way.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.903
What I want to know,
who's that dude

01:50.945 --> 01:52.655
that stuck his (bleep)
in her face?

01:52.696 --> 01:54.949
She should (bleep) that
(bleep)er in the (bleep)hole.

01:54.990 --> 01:57.701
O-kay.

01:57.743 --> 02:01.038
Of everything that I said,
that's what they focus on.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.040
Hey. Eye of the tiger.

02:03.082 --> 02:05.918
You and me, we have
a Panera gift card to win.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.754
-No distractions. Come on.
-EMCEE: Ah, good one here.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.256
Before joining The Seven,

02:10.297 --> 02:12.800
which hero led
a search-and-rescue team...

02:12.842 --> 02:14.927
-Mm...
-Oh, my God.
-...after the 1994

02:14.969 --> 02:16.595
Northridge earthquake?

02:16.637 --> 02:17.805
Isn't it your job

02:17.847 --> 02:19.181
to know this kind of stuff?

02:19.223 --> 02:20.391
Eh...

02:20.432 --> 02:22.518
-It's Lamplighter.
-Thank you.

02:22.560 --> 02:23.686
Yeah, I had
all the trading cards.

02:23.727 --> 02:24.562
Of course you did.

02:26.564 --> 02:27.523
-(chuckles)
-ANTHONY: Hughie?

02:29.275 --> 02:31.402
-Hey.
-Where the hell have you been?

02:31.443 --> 02:32.486
After Gary's store,

02:32.528 --> 02:34.572
we all thought that...

02:35.406 --> 02:36.365
Oh. H-Hi.

02:36.407 --> 02:37.908
Uh, Anthony.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.619
Hughie's best-looking friend
since fourth grade.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.745
(chuckles)
Hi, I'm Annie.

02:41.787 --> 02:42.955
It's nice to meet you.

02:42.997 --> 02:45.124
You look familiar.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.709
-Did you go to Kennedy?
-She's, uh,

02:46.750 --> 02:48.752
-new in town.
-Mm-hmm.
-Fantastic.

02:48.794 --> 02:51.380
So, what are we drinking,
New-to-Town Annie?

02:51.422 --> 02:52.882
Mmm.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.593
So, uh, Gretchen Scaramucci...

02:55.634 --> 02:57.303
-No, no. (groans)
-...she was bigger

02:57.344 --> 02:59.305
than all the guys. Like,

02:59.346 --> 03:00.973
André the Giant-big.
So when Gretchen says

03:01.015 --> 03:05.144
she wants to beat
the living fuck out of this guy

03:05.185 --> 03:07.521
for making a crack
about her girlfriend...

03:07.563 --> 03:09.231
-Oh, you didn't.
-...Hughie gives her

03:09.273 --> 03:12.276
this Clint Eastwood stare,
like... (grunts)

03:12.318 --> 03:14.153
-(laughs)
-And then, bam, runs,

03:14.194 --> 03:16.739
like Forrest Gump-runs,

03:16.780 --> 03:19.074
five blocks down
into a pet store

03:19.116 --> 03:21.577
where he hides behind
this jumbo bag

03:21.619 --> 03:24.997
of Kibbles 'n Bits
for four hours.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.332
STARLIGHT:
Oh...

03:26.373 --> 03:27.708
I'll be right back.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.418
(laughing)

03:29.460 --> 03:30.836
WOMAN:
I know it! I know this!

03:30.878 --> 03:32.129
(Anthony exhales)

03:32.171 --> 03:33.505
Surprised to run
into you here, man.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.715
Yeah. Same goes for you.

03:34.757 --> 03:37.009
I've been worried, asshole.

03:37.051 --> 03:39.011
Ever since Robin, you...

03:39.053 --> 03:41.263
you weren't answering
your phone.

03:41.305 --> 03:44.099
Like, for all I knew,
you were chugging Drano.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.602
I'm sorry, man.

03:46.644 --> 03:48.020
Yeah, you should be.

03:48.062 --> 03:50.189
No, really,
I-I should've called.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.774
You think?

03:51.815 --> 03:53.359
I'm okay.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.611
Really. I-I just...

03:55.653 --> 03:57.529
n-needed a fresh start.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.074
Fresh start?

04:01.075 --> 04:03.035
(chuckles)

04:03.077 --> 04:06.789
Your fresh start
is way out of your league.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.374
Um, you know that, right?

04:08.415 --> 04:09.792
I am aware, yes.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.460
(chuckles)

04:11.502 --> 04:13.045
Annie's great, man.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.463
Live your life.

04:14.505 --> 04:16.173
That's what Robin would want.

04:16.215 --> 04:18.592
(bells dinging)

04:24.264 --> 04:25.307
-WOMAN: Sync mark.
-(beep)

04:25.349 --> 04:26.642
MAN:
We're good.

04:26.684 --> 04:29.478
-You rolling?
-WOMAN: And... action.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.314
My grandfather built this place
with his bare hands.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.358
He was, uh, an amazing man.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.694
Oh, the old piano.

04:36.735 --> 04:37.903
Every night, Mom would sit here

04:37.945 --> 04:40.155
and she would play some songs
and...

04:40.197 --> 04:42.825
I got to be honest, most of the
time, me and my dad would be--

04:42.866 --> 04:44.118
we'd be making model planes.

04:44.159 --> 04:47.913
I can almost smell
the... silver paint.

04:48.914 --> 04:50.207
(sighs)

04:50.249 --> 04:51.834
I really wish
he'd lived long enough

04:51.875 --> 04:54.336
to see me fly
with the Blue Angels.

04:54.378 --> 04:56.296
That would have blown his mind.

04:56.338 --> 04:57.715
That's me in the middle.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.883
(chuckles)

04:59.925 --> 05:01.969
Love you, Mom, Dad.

05:02.011 --> 05:03.012
(tapping)

05:03.053 --> 05:04.555
Welcome to my bedroom.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.515
The Baseball Hall of Fame,
you might call it.

05:06.557 --> 05:07.891
Hasn't changed a bit.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.810
Oh, there they are, the Tigers.

05:09.852 --> 05:11.186
It's my little team.

05:11.228 --> 05:13.022
I played shortstop.
Of course,

05:13.063 --> 05:14.606
I couldn't show
everything I had.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.276
But... let's just say we, uh--

05:17.317 --> 05:19.611
we-we did a lot of winning.
(chuckles)

05:19.653 --> 05:22.865
This is just, um...

05:25.325 --> 05:26.702
Really just, uh--

05:26.744 --> 05:28.787
It's so special to come back.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.081
Hmm.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.959
Uh, I'm sorry,

05:34.001 --> 05:35.294
why is that there?

05:35.335 --> 05:36.712
PRODUCER:
Sorry?

05:36.754 --> 05:38.297
Who put the fucking blanket
on the bed?

05:38.338 --> 05:39.965
Uh, R-Randy Set-Dec, I think.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.050
Who's Randy Set-Dec?

05:41.091 --> 05:42.301
He's-he's over there.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.552
Randy, why?

05:43.594 --> 05:44.970
You fucking asshole.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.139
-Uh...
-Amateur fuck.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.807
What just happened?

05:48.849 --> 05:51.268
("Big Shot"
by Billy Joel playing)

05:54.146 --> 05:56.106
Samaritan's Embrace,

05:56.148 --> 05:59.526
led by Ezekiel
but bankrolled by Vought,

05:59.568 --> 06:01.361
has been shipping Compound V

06:01.403 --> 06:03.614
to 53 hospitals
across the country

06:03.655 --> 06:07.367
since 1971
and gift wrapping it...

06:07.409 --> 06:09.453
(exhales)

06:10.454 --> 06:12.498
...gift wrapping it

06:12.539 --> 06:14.249
-as polio vaccine.
-Are you telling me

06:14.291 --> 06:16.418
God's not reaching up the twats
of American girls

06:16.460 --> 06:17.711
and blessing babies?

06:17.753 --> 06:19.338
Butcher, can you leave God out
of this?

06:19.379 --> 06:22.758
H-Hold on, hold on.
So, no hero was born?

06:22.800 --> 06:26.386
None of them? They're all just
kids dosed with the blue shit.

06:26.428 --> 06:27.596
I mean, even...

06:27.638 --> 06:28.847
Even fucking Starlight.

06:33.143 --> 06:36.355
Do you think--
do you think they know...

06:36.396 --> 06:38.524
what really happened to 'em?

06:38.565 --> 06:40.943
What about Homelander?

06:40.984 --> 06:42.194
Homelander's a black hole.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.279
Never had any public records
and never will.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.156
However,
every single other Supe--

06:46.198 --> 06:47.866
juiced-up lab rats.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.159
My God.

06:49.201 --> 06:50.369
I'm trying to give

06:50.410 --> 06:53.956
a tremendous fucking TED Talk
here, and this...

06:53.997 --> 06:55.582
Frenchie,
can you control her, please?

06:55.624 --> 06:57.584
I do not control her.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.086
(scoffs)

06:59.128 --> 07:00.587
Do you see
what I'm dealing with?

07:00.629 --> 07:02.172
Well, spot on, M.M.

07:02.214 --> 07:05.384
We got Vought for child
endangerment, drug trafficking,

07:05.425 --> 07:09.388
and possibly the largest fraud
in American fucking history.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.723
Raynor's gonna love it.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.392
MOTHER'S MILK:
You better hope she does...

07:13.433 --> 07:15.394
(continues indistinctly)

07:16.895 --> 07:19.106
Uh, hi.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.279
-(snarls)
-FRENCHIE: Hughie, no!

07:25.320 --> 07:26.864
(clicking tongue)
No, no, no.

07:26.905 --> 07:29.074
Not if you're attached
to that hand, no.

07:30.409 --> 07:32.327
It's okay. Yeah.

07:32.369 --> 07:36.081
Well, you know,
all of this, uh, it's...

07:36.123 --> 07:38.917
But it's only part
of the story, no?

07:38.959 --> 07:42.421
I mean, what about
our petite Lazarus here?

07:42.462 --> 07:43.755
She's not an infant.

07:43.797 --> 07:47.009
And she was injected
in a basement, not a hospital.

07:47.050 --> 07:50.012
And there is the small matter
of that she rose from the dead.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.347
Well, your feral pixie dream
girl ain't exactly dictating

07:52.389 --> 07:54.308
her fucking memoirs,
is she, Frenchie?

07:54.349 --> 07:56.518
I'm feeling
she's trying to communicate.

07:56.560 --> 07:59.271
I mean,
she's been doing this for...

07:59.313 --> 08:01.064
Maybe that means something, huh?

08:01.106 --> 08:02.316
Yeah, maybe they're
just fucking chicken scratches.

08:02.357 --> 08:03.233
Let's find out.

08:03.275 --> 08:04.359
Nah, you've been burned.

08:04.401 --> 08:05.861
It's not safe out there for you.

08:05.903 --> 08:08.197
M.M.'s right. You got
to fucking stay put, son.

08:08.238 --> 08:09.281
(scoffs)

08:09.323 --> 08:11.491
Fantastique.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.535
-All right, I'm off.
-HUGHIE: Okay.

08:13.577 --> 08:17.372
I'll just, uh,
keep on Starlight then, right?

08:18.707 --> 08:21.168
Her phone's been tits-up
for a week.

08:21.210 --> 08:24.671
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

08:24.713 --> 08:27.007
No.

08:27.049 --> 08:29.676
But I can, uh... I can check.

08:34.306 --> 08:35.432
All right.

08:35.474 --> 08:36.642
You're with me.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.144
-He is?
-I am?

08:39.186 --> 08:40.687
What, to the CIA lady?

08:40.729 --> 08:44.024
No. We're gonna go
on a little detour.

08:44.066 --> 08:46.276
-You'll love it.
-(patting)

08:46.318 --> 08:48.153
Come on.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.406
ASHLEY:
No, I have been working
with her!

08:51.448 --> 08:54.034
I've been fucking working
with her! I can't believe this.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.036
Who the fuck are you gonna get
to replace me?

08:56.078 --> 08:59.498
I'd like to see
what bitch that is!

08:59.539 --> 09:00.916
You okay?

09:01.959 --> 09:03.919
(chuckles ruefully)

09:03.961 --> 09:05.754
(exhales)

09:05.796 --> 09:08.757
You know that pledge
you mentor during rush week

09:08.799 --> 09:11.176
because she seems sweet
and a little naive

09:11.218 --> 09:12.844
and she doesn't know
she's not supposed to wear UGGs?

09:12.886 --> 09:15.389
(chuckles)
And then, once she's active,

09:15.430 --> 09:16.848
she stabs you in the back,

09:16.890 --> 09:19.101
gets you kicked out
of the house?

09:19.142 --> 09:21.395
(scoffs)

09:21.436 --> 09:22.521
-I'm sorry. I don't...
-It was

09:22.562 --> 09:25.315
my big idea to book you
for the Believe Expo.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.985
What could go wrong, I thought.

09:28.026 --> 09:31.196
You were playing to your base.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.323
At least I don't have to kiss

09:33.365 --> 09:35.742
your ass anymore.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.330
(knocking)

09:40.372 --> 09:43.083
Come in.

09:43.125 --> 09:44.751
Thank you for coming, Starlight.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.546
You fired Ashley?

09:47.587 --> 09:49.548
It was actually
a mutual decision.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.217
She wanted to explore
different career paths,

09:52.259 --> 09:54.219
and, um, we wished her well.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.638
So, I would like you
to take this

09:56.680 --> 09:59.766
in the constructive spirit
that it is intended.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.727
Okay.

10:01.768 --> 10:05.772
You are a selfish,
arrogant child.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.190
Wow.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.859
Back in Iowa,

10:08.900 --> 10:11.445
I bet you watched a lot
of Queen Maeve's movies, right?

10:12.487 --> 10:13.864
I did.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.449
She was a rebel.

10:15.490 --> 10:16.867
Didn't take anyone's shit,

10:16.908 --> 10:18.285
didn't play by the rules.

10:18.327 --> 10:19.619
That's what you wanted to be.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.747
That's what American heroes are.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.498
But it's a myth.

10:23.540 --> 10:27.044
I should know,
because I wrote it.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.379
The truth is,

10:29.421 --> 10:31.548
dozens of people in this company

10:31.590 --> 10:33.550
spent hundreds of hours

10:33.592 --> 10:36.678
to create the thing that is you.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.972
I never asked for that.

10:39.014 --> 10:42.392
Then why don't you burn
the sparkly outfit

10:42.434 --> 10:44.353
and become a cop?

10:46.521 --> 10:48.148
You want to be a superhero.

10:48.190 --> 10:50.192
You want to be famous.

10:51.234 --> 10:53.570
But nobody's famous alone.

10:53.612 --> 10:58.408
So, why don't you cut
the petulant diva shit,

10:58.450 --> 11:00.410
show a little fucking gratitude,

11:00.452 --> 11:02.287
and let us do our job?

11:08.251 --> 11:09.753
No.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.090
I'm sorry.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.425
I mean,
I don't mean to be ungrateful.

11:15.467 --> 11:18.678
But... no red carpets,

11:18.720 --> 11:20.597
no reality TV,

11:20.639 --> 11:23.433
and no Noxzema commercials.

11:23.475 --> 11:26.853
And I want my old uniform back.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.855
I'm gonna save people.

11:28.897 --> 11:31.650
Then I think
we may need to reconsider

11:31.691 --> 11:34.069
your position in The Seven.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.198
And I think
that firing an employee

11:38.240 --> 11:41.451
after she reported
sexual assault on live TV

11:41.493 --> 11:43.328
might tank your stock price.

11:45.122 --> 11:48.458
(sighs) Well, I hope
we can count on your discretion.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.461
I'm sorry,
I don't do discretion anymore.

11:51.503 --> 11:54.798
If anyone asks me who did it,
I'm gonna answer honestly.

11:54.840 --> 11:57.884
Well, I think it's great
that you want to tell the truth.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.387
I just don't know
to whom you're referring.

12:00.429 --> 12:02.806
Oh, I think you know.

12:02.848 --> 12:06.601
I think you've known
for a long time.

12:08.353 --> 12:11.731
Thank you so much for coming,
Starlight.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.567
I have a lot to think about.

12:18.655 --> 12:19.948
(door opens)

12:19.990 --> 12:21.700
(door closes)

12:21.741 --> 12:23.743
(glass breaking)

12:29.082 --> 12:30.584
Okay.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.919
I mean, you take
Tek-Knight's Knightracer?

12:32.961 --> 12:35.172
Had a carbon footprint
the size of a 727.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.299
The thing literally shot fire.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.509
Thanks to me,
now he drives a hybrid.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.720
That's what the Green Crusader
initiative is all about.

12:41.761 --> 12:45.849
To respect what's, what's
beautiful in the world.

12:47.851 --> 12:50.061
-What's up?
-Hi.

12:52.898 --> 12:56.109
So... everything.

12:56.151 --> 12:57.903
(sighs) So beautiful.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.404
COURTENAY:
Good. Let's reset.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.114
Trash back on the beach, please.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.116
Background, put the trash back
on the beach.

13:03.158 --> 13:04.743
All right.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.787
Um, well, we lost my dad
at a young age,

13:07.829 --> 13:09.498
and my mom, she worked two jobs,

13:09.539 --> 13:11.833
so, it was, uh, my older brother
Nathan who,

13:11.875 --> 13:13.960
who pretty much raised me up.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.046
And when I was three, it's like
these guys started shooting

13:16.087 --> 13:17.756
in front of my building

13:17.797 --> 13:19.591
and I outran the damn bullet.
(laughs)

13:19.633 --> 13:21.176
That's kinda how
I figured out...

13:21.218 --> 13:22.511
Can I, can I stop you
right there for a second?

13:22.552 --> 13:25.639
What if we ixnay
the gun violence?

13:25.680 --> 13:28.016
Maybe make it
a click more upbeat?

13:29.059 --> 13:31.144
(laughs)
Yeah, yeah.

13:31.186 --> 13:33.522
NATHAN:
All right, little bro,
I know you're the fastest man

13:33.563 --> 13:35.732
in the world and all that,
but your work ain't done.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.817
Set. Go.

13:38.944 --> 13:40.987
♪ Ring the alarm... ♪

13:41.029 --> 13:42.948
Nope. You're off, bro.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.033
Go again.

13:45.075 --> 13:46.284
Go.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.786
Nope. Go.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.162
No.

13:49.204 --> 13:50.789
No?

13:50.830 --> 13:52.249
What is going on with you, man?

13:52.290 --> 13:54.292
(exhales)

13:56.002 --> 13:58.713
Here comes the A-Train! (grunts)

13:58.755 --> 14:01.716
COURTENAY:
Hey, you knew Popclaw, right?

14:01.758 --> 14:03.677
What? I don't, uh...

14:03.718 --> 14:05.679
COURTENAY:
You guys were
in Teenage Kix together?

14:05.720 --> 14:08.223
You, you heard
she passed away, yeah?

14:08.265 --> 14:10.600
Yeah, they're,
they're saying it was a stroke,

14:10.642 --> 14:13.144
but between you and me,

14:13.186 --> 14:15.063
I think it was probably
a drug overdose.

14:15.105 --> 14:19.401
You want to maybe say
a little something in her honor?

14:22.862 --> 14:26.658
I haven't seen her in years,
so, you know...

14:35.041 --> 14:36.543
(elevator bell chimes)

14:40.463 --> 14:43.883
Boy, you're really milking
this thing for all it's worth.

14:43.925 --> 14:47.345
-Excuse me?
-This empowerment act.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.681
I mean, every time
I'm on a red carpet now,

14:49.723 --> 14:53.143
they're asking me
how I'm supporting Starlight.

14:53.184 --> 14:56.855
But, hey, as long
as you're trending, right?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.648
I know that you might not
get this,

14:58.690 --> 15:01.526
but it's not an act.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.069
I'm just trying to be honest.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.780
Okay. Yeah.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.410
When I was younger,

15:10.452 --> 15:14.998
I read your autobiography so
many times that I wore it out.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.459
I had to buy a second one.

15:17.500 --> 15:21.212
I wanted to live my life
exactly like yours.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.590
Because you didn't just break
all the bones

15:23.632 --> 15:26.051
in your right arm
stopping that school bus

15:26.092 --> 15:28.011
from falling off of a bridge,

15:28.053 --> 15:32.724
but you also went to every kid's
physical therapy afterwards.

15:32.766 --> 15:35.644
Just to show the world
that they were heroes, too.

15:35.685 --> 15:38.772
You really stood for something.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.565
(elevator bell chimes)

15:40.607 --> 15:42.734
But now...

15:42.776 --> 15:46.655
I'm pretty sure that was just
written by the marketing guys.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.787
MAN (on TV):
...hunting for his own food.

15:53.828 --> 15:57.666
When fully mature, this immense
predator of the sea

15:57.707 --> 16:00.960
can reach sizes
of up to 25 feet in length

16:01.002 --> 16:03.129
and over 4,000 pounds.

16:03.171 --> 16:07.509
They can reach speeds
of up to 35 miles per hour...

16:07.550 --> 16:09.177
Mon coeur.

16:11.096 --> 16:14.015
Would you like me to change it?

16:21.272 --> 16:22.816
Incroyable.

16:22.857 --> 16:24.025
You talked to me.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.318
-She talked to me.
-That's talking?

16:25.360 --> 16:27.529
Well, she communicated anyway.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.739
-She likes Shark Week, huh?
-I'll call BuzzFeed.

16:29.781 --> 16:32.492
I wonder if she lived
by the water.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.667
You know, you can't fool me.

16:40.709 --> 16:45.130
Who is she? What does she want?
Why is she here?

16:45.171 --> 16:47.090
She could be the key to it all.

16:47.132 --> 16:50.009
-That's what you think, huh?
-No, that's not what I think.

16:50.051 --> 16:52.679
Yes, you do. It torments you.
It's okay.

16:52.721 --> 16:54.723
Listen, I got one word for you.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.975
It's a surefire way
to solve this puzzle.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.144
Once and for all.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.395
Tell me.

17:00.437 --> 17:01.604
Mesmer.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.565
Mesmer?

17:03.606 --> 17:05.442
You want help from a Supe?

17:05.483 --> 17:08.611
He despise Vought, hates them,
hates the other Supes.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.447
And the enemy of your enemy...

17:10.488 --> 17:14.242
Frenchie, what part of "you're
burned" do you not understand?

17:14.284 --> 17:15.869
Oh, come on. It's a quick trip.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.537
She and I will hide in the van.

17:17.579 --> 17:18.997
Let's go. In, out, boom, bing.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.875
Boom, bing? Look, I'll tell you
what I can do.

17:21.916 --> 17:25.170
I can... possibly

17:26.504 --> 17:27.881
tattoo "fuck no" on your ass.

17:27.922 --> 17:28.923
Ah, come on.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.008
Best I can do.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.051
You know...

17:34.095 --> 17:36.055
I've seen you eat ice cream.

17:36.097 --> 17:38.099
-Oh, my God.
-Chunky Monkey, I believe.

17:38.141 --> 17:39.809
-Where is this going?
-Well, you know,

17:39.851 --> 17:41.811
you take a spoonful--
a chunk of fudge, perhaps.

17:41.853 --> 17:44.105
But then I see you
with the surface is uneven.

17:44.147 --> 17:45.815
So what do you do?
You take another scoop,

17:45.857 --> 17:48.109
you try to even it out,
which, tragically,

17:48.151 --> 17:49.819
creates a corresponding divot.

17:49.861 --> 17:52.530
Ultimately, there is only
but one choice for you, no?

17:52.572 --> 17:54.407
To consume the entire pint.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.743
No, you don't want to,
you don't want to.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.119
But you must.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.662
And I tell you why, my friend,

17:59.704 --> 18:02.832
because you cannot bear things
out of order.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.378
And she...

18:09.088 --> 18:10.632
...she's out of order.

18:14.177 --> 18:16.679
All right. You want to tell me
where we're going?

18:19.599 --> 18:21.351
You don't do it anymore.

18:21.392 --> 18:23.645
-What?
-You know that feeling you get

18:23.686 --> 18:25.897
when you tip your chair back
too far,

18:25.939 --> 18:28.066
and you catch yourself
just before you fall?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.651
Yeah?

18:29.692 --> 18:31.361
You used to look like that
all day long.

18:31.402 --> 18:32.946
-(laughs)
-But now look at you,

18:32.987 --> 18:37.116
neck-deep in shit,
cool as a cucumber.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.287
You ain't half the twat
I thought you were, Hughie.

18:41.329 --> 18:45.583
You know, you're always calling
people "cunts" or "twats."

18:45.625 --> 18:48.086
But I just-- I never really got
how that's an insult?

18:48.127 --> 18:50.713
They're flexible,
take a pounding,

18:50.755 --> 18:52.090
and they're
the reason behind, like,

18:52.131 --> 18:53.675
98% of my life decisions.

18:53.716 --> 18:56.302
BUTCHER:
You're doing good, Hughie.

18:56.344 --> 18:59.138
And you're a good cunt.

19:00.974 --> 19:04.227
Well, here we are.

19:04.269 --> 19:05.812
Church?

19:05.854 --> 19:10.358
Seek and ye shall find, me son.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.610
Come on.

19:12.652 --> 19:16.322
SHEILA:
Uh, some days are harder

19:16.364 --> 19:20.326
than others, obviously, uh...

19:20.368 --> 19:22.495
You know, the other day,

19:22.537 --> 19:24.205
I-I wanted to talk to my friend

19:24.247 --> 19:27.208
about all this, but I couldn't.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.377
That's why this group
is-is so great.

19:29.419 --> 19:32.005
It's so important.

19:32.046 --> 19:34.507
I know it's wrong
to feel angry.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.596
After all, Tek-Knight saved me.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.139
I-I just wish he'd been

19:41.180 --> 19:43.433
a-a little more gentle
with my spine.

19:43.474 --> 19:47.312
LYDIA:
It's about acceptance, isn't it?

19:47.353 --> 19:49.564
Letting go. Moving on.

19:52.650 --> 19:55.320
Seth, you're up.

19:58.907 --> 20:00.491
(Seth clears throat)

20:00.533 --> 20:02.452
Hey... (clears throat)
Hey, everybody.

20:02.493 --> 20:04.370
OTHERS:
Hey, Seth.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.122
Uh, so I'm kind of a writer.

20:06.164 --> 20:07.874
Uh, I work in marketing.

20:07.916 --> 20:10.418
Uh, there's this one hero,
who shall remain nameless,

20:10.460 --> 20:11.961
but has ice powers.

20:12.003 --> 20:14.714
Ice Princess.

20:14.756 --> 20:18.468
I'm not allowed to say.

20:18.509 --> 20:21.179
Anyway, she, uh,
took a liking to me.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.890
It was heady, man.

20:23.932 --> 20:26.392
Intoxicating.

20:26.434 --> 20:29.187
No one wants to fuck the writer.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.398
Needless to say,
I fell for her, big-time.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.068
(whispering): What kind
of nobber falls for a Supe?

20:35.109 --> 20:39.322
SETH:
Anyway, we were, uh,
you know, being intimate,

20:39.364 --> 20:43.618
when she climaxed and
accidentally turned into ice.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.411
Just for a second,

20:45.453 --> 20:47.872
but I was, uh,

20:47.914 --> 20:51.459
still in there,

20:51.501 --> 20:54.337
at negative 346 degrees.

20:54.379 --> 20:56.965
Same temperature
as liquid nitrogen.

20:57.006 --> 21:00.343
As you can imagine, um...

21:02.512 --> 21:04.222
...it snapped off.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.641
(participants gasp)

21:06.683 --> 21:10.645
The crazy thing is,
I still miss her.

21:10.687 --> 21:15.108
It's like, that's the cost
of a mortal like me

21:15.149 --> 21:18.152
for being with a god like her.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.279
If a Supe done that
when she was happy,

21:20.321 --> 21:22.949
imagine what one would do
if she found out

21:22.991 --> 21:24.826
you'd been lying to her
from the get-go?

21:24.867 --> 21:26.869
LYDIA:
Excuse me.

21:28.997 --> 21:30.707
You have something
you'd like to share?

21:30.748 --> 21:32.667
No, no. A-Apologies.

21:32.709 --> 21:36.087
Please do, uh,
continue the Ice Capades.

21:36.129 --> 21:39.507
LYDIA:
We don't make jokes
or judgments here.

21:39.549 --> 21:42.844
Why don't you take the talking
stick and tell us your story?

21:42.885 --> 21:45.722
Nah, I'm good.

21:45.763 --> 21:47.932
You know, I've seen guys
like you before.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.392
Oh, I seriously doubt that.

21:49.434 --> 21:50.893
The smirk, the jokes,

21:50.935 --> 21:52.729
it's all a defense mechanism.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.355
But you don't have
to do that here.

21:54.397 --> 21:57.358
This is a safe space.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.652
I said I'm good.

21:59.694 --> 22:01.654
Time to move on.

22:02.864 --> 22:05.074
Go ahead, Seth.
Give him the stick.

22:05.116 --> 22:06.576
(participants gasp)

22:06.617 --> 22:09.996
You, back off,
or I'll shove this stick

22:10.038 --> 22:11.956
where your dick used to be.

22:14.208 --> 22:16.794
You're a bunch of pathetic
Supe-worshipping cunts.

22:16.836 --> 22:20.590
I bet you'd thank a Supe if they
shat on your mum's best china.

22:20.631 --> 22:23.551
Did it ever occur to you
that they split your spine

22:23.593 --> 22:27.513
or broke your dick
just for a laugh?

22:28.848 --> 22:31.267
Where's your fucking rage?!

22:31.309 --> 22:33.770
Your self-respect?!

22:35.354 --> 22:37.398
Sitting here
in your little share circle.

22:38.566 --> 22:40.526
Having a little whinge
and a moan.

22:40.568 --> 22:42.945
Fuck "letting go."

22:42.987 --> 22:44.697
You should be out there
with a fucking chain saw,

22:44.739 --> 22:46.282
going after 'em!

22:48.701 --> 22:51.329
Just a bunch of scared
fucking rabbits.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.914
(stick clatters)

22:52.955 --> 22:54.582
Supes are all the same.

22:54.624 --> 22:56.334
Every fucking one of 'em.

22:58.961 --> 23:00.338
(door opens and closes)

23:00.379 --> 23:02.215
Uh, he's, um...

23:03.341 --> 23:05.093
Sorry.

23:11.599 --> 23:13.559
Oh, Ms. Stillwell, hey,
you wanted to see me, right?

23:13.601 --> 23:15.645
Yeah, I'm running late.
Can you walk with me?

23:15.686 --> 23:17.980
DEEP:
Yeah, sure. Hey, look,
I brought a little present

23:18.022 --> 23:19.982
-for your little guy.
-Ah.

23:20.024 --> 23:22.026
Never, uh, too young to start
saving the world, right?

23:22.068 --> 23:25.404
I'm gonna need you
to make a public apology.

23:25.446 --> 23:28.908
And you're going to be taking
a sabbatical from The Seven.

23:28.950 --> 23:31.369
-What?
-We are going
to be stationing you

23:31.410 --> 23:33.496
in Sandusky, Ohio for a while.

23:33.538 --> 23:36.415
Okay, okay, look, I-I know,
I know, I know my brain wasn't

23:36.457 --> 23:38.126
in the right place,
but, but my heart was.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.545
And it's just that,
that damn Oceanland.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.421
-They wouldn't let me...
-This is not about
the dead dolphin.

23:42.463 --> 23:43.840
This is about Starlight.

23:43.881 --> 23:45.550
Starlight?
What are you... (chuckles)

23:45.591 --> 23:47.093
What about Starlight?

23:47.135 --> 23:48.427
Everybody seems to want to know

23:48.469 --> 23:50.263
who she was referencing
in that speech,

23:50.304 --> 23:52.223
and it is not going away.

23:52.265 --> 23:55.601
It's only a matter of time
before she, or, let's be honest,

23:55.643 --> 23:57.812
some of the other women,
speak up.

23:57.854 --> 24:00.565
-So we need to get ahead of it.
-Okay.

24:00.606 --> 24:03.192
There may have been
a misunderstanding, I know that,

24:03.234 --> 24:05.403
but can't you just...

24:05.444 --> 24:08.406
you know, handle it?
Like, like you do?

24:08.447 --> 24:11.909
This is the way
we are handling things now.

24:16.664 --> 24:18.249
I'm in full support of women

24:18.291 --> 24:21.586
and their ongoing bravery
in speaking out.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.838
(sighs)

24:23.880 --> 24:26.257
(clears throat) I'm sorry...
let me start that over.

24:26.299 --> 24:27.842
I'm in full support of women
and their ongoing bravery...

24:29.343 --> 24:31.304
Fuck, I'm sorry.

24:31.345 --> 24:32.680
Yeah, let's just cut.
I'm sorry.

24:32.722 --> 24:34.140
MAN:
Scene take two. Alpha mark.

24:34.182 --> 24:37.518
Starlight,
I hope you can forgive me.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.228
-Harder to sell.
-To sell it. Yeah.

24:39.270 --> 24:40.897
-Just a little harder.
-Perfect. Let's do that.

24:40.938 --> 24:43.107
Speaking out.
We can all become stronger...

24:43.149 --> 24:45.234
by listening. Okay.

24:45.276 --> 24:47.528
I realize that my behavior

24:47.570 --> 24:50.656
has caused Starlight
a great deal of pain,

24:50.698 --> 24:54.493
and I sincerely apologize
for this.

24:54.535 --> 24:56.287
Though at the time I believed

24:56.329 --> 24:57.872
that our encounter
was consensual,

24:57.914 --> 25:00.958
I now realize that, um,
I misread the moment...

25:01.000 --> 25:03.461
Our new movie, Insurrection,
it's really exciting.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.046
It's my first, uh, movie
with the, uh...

25:05.087 --> 25:08.257
in the Vought Cinematic
Universe, uh, the VCU.

25:08.299 --> 25:09.926
NARRATOR:
New York. The hearts

25:09.967 --> 25:12.720
of seven million men and women
beat inside this city.

25:12.762 --> 25:16.098
But there's only one person
who can see inside their hearts

25:16.140 --> 25:18.476
and read their minds.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.019
This man is the rapist.

25:21.771 --> 25:24.273
(siren wailing)

25:25.066 --> 25:27.026
There are no secrets from me.

25:27.068 --> 25:28.945

Okay.
"There are no secrets from me."

26:04.063 --> 26:06.899
-There are no secrets from me.
-There are no secrets from me.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.778
Hey.

26:10.820 --> 26:13.030
What number am I thinking of?

26:13.072 --> 26:15.700
867?

26:15.741 --> 26:17.868
Fucking amazing.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.996
This guy's fucking amazing.

26:20.037 --> 26:23.207
So, what am I thinking of?

26:25.251 --> 26:27.253
I'm thinking the same thing.

26:27.295 --> 26:28.921
Cool. (chuckles)

26:28.963 --> 26:32.008
-Now, why don't I put this down.
-Okay.

26:32.049 --> 26:33.592
-Yeah. Okay.
-Cool.

26:33.634 --> 26:36.095
-Thank-thank you.
-Yeah.

26:36.137 --> 26:38.222
-Mr. Mesmer.
-Ah, just-just Mesmer.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.557
No "mister" necessary.

26:39.598 --> 26:42.018
-You know, I'm a big fan, man.
-Thanks.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.602
-Weren't you in Teenage Kix
with A-Train?
-Yep.

26:43.644 --> 26:45.855
Yeah. Yo, A-Train's
really blown up, hasn't he?

26:45.896 --> 26:47.440
-Yeah.
-He's doing his thing.

26:47.481 --> 26:49.108
Yeah, he's great.
I'm-I'm really happy for him.

26:49.150 --> 26:50.901
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.570
You a fan of the show?

26:52.611 --> 26:54.822
Oh, nah, man.
I've never seen it.

26:54.864 --> 26:57.283
-Okay.
-You know what I'm a fan of?

26:57.325 --> 26:59.368
Your insider trading.

26:59.410 --> 27:01.078
(exhales)

27:01.120 --> 27:03.205
The way you brushed your hand
up against that Wall Street guy?

27:03.247 --> 27:06.959
Brother, that shit right there,
now, that was ruthless.

27:07.001 --> 27:09.211
I mean, Vought dropped you
like a hot potato afterwards,

27:09.253 --> 27:11.756
which I think is some bullshit,
but with the SEC coming...

27:11.797 --> 27:13.299
Who the fuck are you?

27:15.593 --> 27:17.553
Why don't you take a peep
and see?

27:25.227 --> 27:26.645
How do you know about Cleo?

27:28.647 --> 27:31.275
There are no secrets from me.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.152
Well, I work for Child Services.

27:33.194 --> 27:36.739
My colleague Tina,
she owes me a favor.

27:36.781 --> 27:40.534
See, she, just like I,
believe in second chances.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.203
Cut the shit.

27:42.244 --> 27:44.163
I lost custody three years ago.

27:44.205 --> 27:45.456
Nobody believes
in second chances

27:45.498 --> 27:47.458
for fuckups like me.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.877
(panting)

27:53.756 --> 27:55.633
(exhales)

27:55.674 --> 27:57.676
She's waiting on you.

27:59.637 --> 28:03.307
Tina. Hey.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.226
-TINA: Hi.
-MOTHER'S MILK:
It's good to see you.

28:05.267 --> 28:07.186
TINA:
Good to see you, too.

28:07.228 --> 28:09.522
Five minutes.
Next time you owe me.

28:09.563 --> 28:11.273
MOTHER'S MILK:
I do.

28:11.315 --> 28:13.275
Hey, Cleo.

28:14.318 --> 28:15.694
(sniffles)

28:15.736 --> 28:17.696
You remember your old man?

28:17.738 --> 28:20.241
Hi, Charles.

28:31.419 --> 28:34.422
I'm-I'm sorry that, uh...

28:38.634 --> 28:41.637
I'm gonna try and be
in your life a little bit more.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.640
Would that be okay?

28:44.682 --> 28:46.642
I guess.

28:46.684 --> 28:49.061
TINA:
Okay, Cleo.

28:49.103 --> 28:51.647
We got to get back.

28:52.648 --> 28:54.358
-Bye.
-Hey, uh...

29:01.991 --> 29:03.576
I-I just...

29:03.617 --> 29:05.744
I just want to know
you don't hate me.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.707
I don't really know you.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.299
Hey, wait, um...

29:21.802 --> 29:23.721
So you can know me
a little better.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.891
I don't have a DVD player.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.935
Bye.

29:32.188 --> 29:33.856
Thanks again.
I'll call you next week.

29:33.898 --> 29:35.900
Okay. You all right?

29:38.235 --> 29:40.237
(sniffling)

29:41.280 --> 29:43.240
I can see her every month?

29:43.282 --> 29:45.618
One hour, supervised.

29:45.659 --> 29:47.244
You clean?

29:47.286 --> 29:49.246
-I-I can be.
-Good.

29:49.288 --> 29:52.208
Who do you want me to read?

29:54.251 --> 29:56.378
What are we doing here?

30:01.717 --> 30:05.638
My wife, Becca,
used to hum the Spice Girls.

30:05.679 --> 30:08.307
Drove me round the fucking bend,
you know.

30:08.349 --> 30:10.059
All day long,

30:10.100 --> 30:12.603
walking around the house,
humming.

30:12.645 --> 30:14.647
She was happy.

30:16.148 --> 30:19.109
Now, fuck know why
she was happy with me, but...

30:19.151 --> 30:22.071
she was happy.

30:38.128 --> 30:41.131
Homelander raped her.

30:48.138 --> 30:50.140
Jesus.

30:55.145 --> 30:57.565
I-I'm sorry.

31:06.949 --> 31:10.160
Not long after that,
she came and sat right here.

31:12.454 --> 31:14.415
I know this
'cause she got tagged

31:14.456 --> 31:16.417
in that security camera
right there.

31:22.673 --> 31:25.259
She sat here for three hours.

31:27.261 --> 31:29.680
Didn't move a muscle.

31:34.268 --> 31:37.271
Then she just got up
and walked away.

31:43.277 --> 31:45.696
That was eight years ago.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.241
And nobody's seen her since.

31:52.286 --> 31:55.247
Either Homelander killed her

31:55.289 --> 31:58.292
or she killed herself.
Same difference.

32:04.632 --> 32:06.592
You see,

32:06.634 --> 32:09.595
I know what it's like
to lose someone.

32:12.222 --> 32:16.644
You and me,
we're in this together.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.940
For Robin...

32:21.982 --> 32:23.984
and Becca.

32:27.404 --> 32:31.325
That is why
you can't allow yourself

32:31.367 --> 32:34.870
to be distracted
by another bird.

32:36.580 --> 32:39.166
Especially not a Supe.

32:49.426 --> 32:51.428
Just remember...

32:54.014 --> 32:56.433
...who your friends

32:56.475 --> 32:59.436
and who your enemies are.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.484
(sniffles)

33:25.212 --> 33:28.424
That is gonna kill somebody
when it lands in Boston.

33:31.844 --> 33:34.847
Look, I heard what happened.

33:36.014 --> 33:39.643
I am so, so sorry.

33:39.685 --> 33:42.187
What kind of place
did you grow up in?

33:42.229 --> 33:44.064
Well, I moved around a lot,

33:44.106 --> 33:46.316
so, uh, it was
a bunch of condos.

33:46.358 --> 33:48.819
So, what if I took you
to a house

33:48.861 --> 33:52.698
you'd never seen before,
full of photos

33:52.740 --> 33:54.992
of parents you never met,

33:55.033 --> 33:57.411
toys you never played with,

33:57.453 --> 34:00.456
Hardy Boy books
that you never read?

34:01.957 --> 34:04.585
And then I asked you

34:04.626 --> 34:08.756
how much all that fake
fucking bullshit meant to you?

34:10.591 --> 34:12.801
How would that make you feel?

34:12.843 --> 34:15.345
I wouldn't like that.

34:20.058 --> 34:23.395
I'm really sorry
about the blanket.

34:23.437 --> 34:25.272
It never should have been there,

34:25.314 --> 34:27.524
and Randy Set-Dec
has already been terminated.

34:30.027 --> 34:32.988
But right now...

34:33.030 --> 34:36.742
we need to finish that tour

34:36.784 --> 34:39.369
and to show how down-to-earth

34:39.411 --> 34:41.955
and ready to serve you are.

34:41.997 --> 34:45.167
And I need you
to tell the mother story.

34:45.209 --> 34:47.085
Please.

34:52.633 --> 34:54.843
Please do it for me.

34:54.885 --> 34:57.137
(exhales)

34:57.179 --> 35:00.224
It was actually my mom
who dragged me along

35:00.265 --> 35:01.975
to my first
Little League practice,

35:02.017 --> 35:03.894
and, uh, pretty soon after that,

35:03.936 --> 35:05.145
I-I just loved the game

35:05.187 --> 35:06.772
more than anything else
in the world.

35:06.814 --> 35:08.774
So every year

35:08.816 --> 35:11.360
she would bake me
a birthday cake

35:11.401 --> 35:13.445
in the shape
of a baseball diamond.

35:13.487 --> 35:17.825
And... oh, I got to tell you,
it was perfect.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.493
Perfect.

35:19.535 --> 35:23.121
Everything, down to
the last minute details.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.125
Just like her.

35:29.127 --> 35:32.089
MAN:
Cut. Perfect. So great.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.341
-So we're done?
-Uh, yes.

35:34.383 --> 35:36.093
Great.

35:48.814 --> 35:51.149
MESMER:
So...

35:51.191 --> 35:54.027
she can't talk or won't talk?

35:54.069 --> 35:55.362
That's what
you're gonna tell us.

35:55.404 --> 35:57.155
Anything in particular
you want to know?

35:57.197 --> 35:59.241
-Everything there is to know.
-Well, that narrows it down.

35:59.283 --> 36:01.243
Mon coeur.

36:01.285 --> 36:03.245
Will you come?

36:03.287 --> 36:05.289
Have a seat.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.835
It's okay. Have a seat.

36:18.051 --> 36:19.720
Gentle.

36:19.761 --> 36:21.513
-Hmm?
-Yeah.

36:25.976 --> 36:28.437
(takes deep breath)

36:30.355 --> 36:32.190
(Mesmer sighs)

36:38.030 --> 36:39.823
(gasps softly)

36:44.411 --> 36:45.954
(grunts)

36:45.996 --> 36:48.332
-(screams) Jesus fucking...
-MOTHER'S MILK: Goddamn it.

36:48.373 --> 36:50.292
-Relax!
-No.

36:50.334 --> 36:51.543
Everyone relax!

36:51.585 --> 36:52.920
-Just-just go walk it off.
-Walk it off?

36:52.961 --> 36:54.630
She broke my fucking wrist!

36:54.671 --> 36:56.715
She didn't intend any harm.

36:56.757 --> 36:58.050
Oh, could have fooled me.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.136
Get out!
I'm going to the hospital.

37:01.178 --> 37:02.387
Not till we get
what we came for, Mesmer.

37:02.429 --> 37:04.264
-Fuck you! The session's over!
-Sit down!

37:04.306 --> 37:06.433
(panting, sobbing)

37:06.475 --> 37:07.684
Okay, listen.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.645
-I was a field medic.
-(groans)

37:09.686 --> 37:12.189
Don't look at her.
Look at me.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.565
I can patch you up better

37:13.607 --> 37:15.484
than any of those
oxy junkies in the E.R.,

37:15.525 --> 37:17.611
or I can break your other wrist.
You decide.

37:17.653 --> 37:20.489
(crying)

37:20.530 --> 37:23.367
Good. Now, do you have
any bandages or a splint?

37:23.408 --> 37:25.786
No, I don't have
a goddamn splint!

37:25.827 --> 37:27.955
(ringtone playing
"Ride of the Valkyries")

37:27.996 --> 37:29.957
-(panting)
-It's Butcher.

37:29.998 --> 37:31.416
(whispers):
Be quiet.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.378
-Butcher.
-Where are you?

37:34.419 --> 37:35.879
Shake Shack.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.381
Really?

37:37.422 --> 37:40.008
Fucking magic, that place.

37:40.050 --> 37:41.802
-What'd you get?
-ShackBurger,

37:41.843 --> 37:43.845
uh, cheese fries,

37:43.887 --> 37:46.723
-cookie dough concrete.
-Sounds good.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.058
Does it taste like lies?

37:48.100 --> 37:49.518
I got your phone linked

37:49.559 --> 37:51.436
to my
Find-Your-Shithead-Friends app.

37:51.478 --> 37:54.231
Now, where the fuck are you?

38:02.906 --> 38:06.201
Yes, this...
this is a superhero.

38:06.243 --> 38:08.620
-This is good.
-Okay.

38:08.662 --> 38:11.248
-We just keep...?
-Yeah, yeah.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.250
Well, people are
always asking me, you know,

38:13.291 --> 38:16.253
what it's like to live
with my coworkers, and...

38:16.294 --> 38:18.630
the truth is,
we're all great friends,

38:18.672 --> 38:21.341
you know, behind the scenes
just as much as we are to the...

38:21.383 --> 38:22.968
uh...

38:23.010 --> 38:24.845
Oh, hey, Elena.

38:24.886 --> 38:26.638
-Hey.
-This is my friend.

38:26.680 --> 38:28.348
I left a pile of messages for...

38:28.390 --> 38:30.350
Yeah, that's what we are.
We're friends.

38:30.392 --> 38:32.144
Can you ask them
to turn that off, please?

38:32.185 --> 38:34.104
I'm gonna need
five minutes, okay?

38:34.146 --> 38:35.689
(indistinct conversation)

38:35.731 --> 38:37.691
Yeah, we're, uh,
doing a reality show.

38:37.733 --> 38:41.319
-That's invasive.
-What are you even doing here?

38:41.361 --> 38:44.239
MAEVE:
I would never turn up
to your work.

38:44.281 --> 38:46.450
-I was worried about you.
-I had a bad night.

38:46.491 --> 38:49.453
This Teflon shit, it might work
for everybody else,

38:49.494 --> 38:51.705
-but not with me.
-Will you keep your voice down?

38:51.747 --> 38:54.291
Just tell me what's going on.

38:54.332 --> 38:57.085
Did you ever think that, um...

38:59.546 --> 39:01.882
...maybe I was just looking
for a hookup?

39:01.923 --> 39:03.425
I know you think you know me...

39:03.467 --> 39:06.219
-I used to.
-Yeah, used to. I've changed.

39:07.262 --> 39:08.513
Yeah.

39:08.555 --> 39:09.890
I still know you.

39:09.931 --> 39:11.850
-Oh, come on.
-Afraid to be seen with me.

39:11.892 --> 39:14.978
Afraid to ask for help.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.481
Just... afraid.

39:29.201 --> 39:30.994
Are you filming, Courtenay?

39:31.036 --> 39:33.705
I told you to turn
the fucking cameras off!

39:33.747 --> 39:35.290
We cut... we cut a while ago.

39:35.332 --> 39:36.958
We're setting up a shot
for later.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.127
-MAEVE: Fucking bitch.
-B-roll on the building.

39:39.169 --> 39:40.921
All right, you can cut it, guys.

39:40.962 --> 39:42.881
FRENCHIE:
It's okay.

39:42.923 --> 39:44.007
Everything is okay.

39:44.049 --> 39:45.342
(knocking)

39:48.428 --> 39:50.931
(sighs)
Gentlemen.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.768
Wow. Mesmer.

39:54.810 --> 39:56.520
Hello.

39:56.561 --> 39:58.271
Big fan.

39:58.313 --> 39:59.564
Be with you in a minute.

39:59.606 --> 40:03.318
(quietly):
Well, now we got to kill him.

40:03.360 --> 40:04.861
No, we don't have to kill him.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.863
Look, we made a deal
with the guy.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.741
If he keeps his trap shut,
he gets to see his kid.

40:09.783 --> 40:11.368
He's just a dad with his kid.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.370
He's a fucking Supe with a kid.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.372
What the fuck were you thinking,
coming here?

40:15.413 --> 40:18.083
-You know better than that.
-Sometimes you get further

40:18.125 --> 40:20.919
with people
by treating them like people.

40:24.297 --> 40:26.258
BUTCHER:
Nice decor.

40:26.299 --> 40:28.844
'80s serial killer.
Love it.

40:28.885 --> 40:31.888
All right, then,
let's get cracking.

40:47.571 --> 40:50.115
There's a camp in a...
in a jungle.

40:50.157 --> 40:51.658
(indistinct voices in distance)

40:53.952 --> 40:56.246
She's a soldier.

40:58.915 --> 41:02.544
There's a-a flag
with a two-headed snake on it.

41:02.586 --> 41:04.546
Two-headed snake?

41:04.588 --> 41:06.298
Like...?

41:06.339 --> 41:08.008
Yeah.

41:08.049 --> 41:10.051
-With red rays behind it?
-What does that mean?

41:10.093 --> 41:12.137
It's the flag of the
Shining Light Liberation Army.

41:12.179 --> 41:13.513
Frenchie...

41:13.555 --> 41:16.016
you're dating a terrorist.

41:17.893 --> 41:19.686
Is this true?

41:26.902 --> 41:29.321
(indistinct chatter,
birds chirping)

41:38.788 --> 41:41.625
(takes deep breath)

42:14.449 --> 42:16.660
(laughing)

42:21.122 --> 42:22.499
Ah.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.751
(man chuckles)

42:35.470 --> 42:38.056
FRENCHIE:
There must be more
to all of this.

42:38.098 --> 42:40.850
She can't be a terrorist.

42:40.892 --> 42:42.560
Yeah, well, you just fucking
keep her under control.

42:42.602 --> 42:44.521
Okay, so they smuggle in

42:44.562 --> 42:46.523
a top-shelf extremist recruit

42:46.564 --> 42:48.525
and pump her up with Compound V.

42:48.566 --> 42:49.776
And then,
when she's good and ready,

42:49.818 --> 42:50.986
they cut her loose
to wreak havoc.

42:51.027 --> 42:52.279
-She wouldn't.
-HUGHIE: Wait.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.322
Why would Vought give
Compound V to terrorists?

42:54.364 --> 42:57.158
'Cause the only thing
more dangerous than a terrorist

42:57.200 --> 42:59.536
is a Supe terrorist,
and the only way to fight it...

42:59.577 --> 43:01.705
Is with Sergeant
Fucking Homelander.

43:01.746 --> 43:04.416
Got to let the cunts
in the army now.

43:04.457 --> 43:07.127
Those fuckers are creating
super villains.

43:07.168 --> 43:09.796
And maybe there's more of 'em,
God knows how many.

43:09.838 --> 43:11.381
Holy shit.

43:11.423 --> 43:14.009
Okay, this is a clusterfuck,
even for us.

43:14.050 --> 43:16.803
No, listen to me, okay? Maybe
that's what they want her to be.

43:16.845 --> 43:18.972
But that's not who she is.

43:19.014 --> 43:20.890
-That's not what she wants.
-And you know this

43:20.932 --> 43:22.517
'cause she bends
your fucking ear off?

43:22.559 --> 43:24.602
She saved my life!
She's not bad.

43:24.644 --> 43:26.521
She just want to go home.

43:26.563 --> 43:29.316
She's a fucking Supe,
just like the rest.

43:29.357 --> 43:32.485
How many times do I have
to fucking say it, eh?

43:36.114 --> 43:38.742
Mon coeur,
I know you understand me.

43:38.783 --> 43:40.618
Please. Please.

43:40.660 --> 43:42.329
Tell them who you are.

43:42.370 --> 43:43.747
Tell them what I see.

43:54.424 --> 43:55.675
No.

43:59.888 --> 44:02.349
(sniffling, panting quietly)

44:03.600 --> 44:05.727
(breath trembling)

44:24.746 --> 44:27.082
The drawings are, uh,
palm trees in front of the moon.

44:27.123 --> 44:29.334
It's where she grew up.

44:29.376 --> 44:31.336
-(automatic gunfire)
-(woman screams)

44:31.378 --> 44:32.962
(man shouts indistinctly)

44:33.004 --> 44:34.422
They killed her parents.

44:34.464 --> 44:36.674
They kidnapped her
and her brother.

44:36.716 --> 44:38.843
Forced them to be soldiers.

44:40.053 --> 44:41.262
(indistinct chatter)

44:41.304 --> 44:43.056
(automatic gunfire in distance)

44:44.766 --> 44:46.226
No, Kimiko...

44:46.267 --> 44:48.645
You eat it.

44:48.686 --> 44:52.107
She just wants to go back and
get her brother out of there.

44:55.527 --> 44:57.529
Her name's Kimiko.

45:03.701 --> 45:05.161
Kimiko.

45:10.291 --> 45:12.168
Bonjour, Kimiko.

45:16.673 --> 45:18.216
(Butcher sighs)

45:18.258 --> 45:21.261
All right, take her back
to the safe house.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.681
MOTHER'S MILK
Where you headed?

45:24.722 --> 45:26.558
I'm gonna go see Raynor.

45:26.599 --> 45:29.727
We've got more than enough
to get the Feds on board now.

45:32.147 --> 45:36.609
You tell anyone what you saw
or heard here today,

45:36.651 --> 45:40.113
and I'll cut your hands off and
shove 'em so far up your ass,

45:40.155 --> 45:43.616
your fingers'll give us a little
wave out your throat, yeah?

45:47.662 --> 45:49.998
Fuck off, wanker.

45:50.039 --> 45:51.875
(door opens)

45:51.916 --> 45:53.460
(TV news music plays)

45:53.501 --> 45:55.670
NEWSMAN:
Some controversial news today

45:55.712 --> 45:57.213
as the Deep went public
with his apology.

45:57.255 --> 45:58.965
DEEP:
I realize that my behavior

45:59.007 --> 46:01.718
caused Starlight
a great deal of pain,

46:01.759 --> 46:04.387
and I sincerely apologize.

46:05.430 --> 46:08.183
WOMAN:
Fuck you, fish dick!

46:08.224 --> 46:09.476
(tires squeal)

46:09.517 --> 46:11.686
Keep speaking your truth!

46:11.728 --> 46:14.063
DEEP:
I'm in full support of women

46:14.105 --> 46:16.524
and their ongoing bravery...

46:16.566 --> 46:19.777
BUTCHER:
Never got the point of these.

46:19.819 --> 46:21.779
To me, they always looked
like Granddad's bollocks

46:21.821 --> 46:23.031
flopping in the wind.

46:25.325 --> 46:28.203
Do you have
the Compound V or not?

46:28.244 --> 46:30.663
I've got the Compound V...

46:30.705 --> 46:34.125
proof that Vought's injected
babies right across the country,

46:34.167 --> 46:37.629
and... something
even more fucking diabolical.

46:37.670 --> 46:39.172
Worse than dosing babies?

46:39.214 --> 46:41.132
Let's just say,
with these cunts,

46:41.174 --> 46:43.134
there ain't no rock bottom.

46:43.176 --> 46:45.720
Let's get it to the lab...

46:46.554 --> 46:48.097
Not so fast.

46:48.139 --> 46:49.682
(clicks tongue)

46:50.725 --> 46:53.019
First things first, eh?

46:54.687 --> 46:56.189
A list of your demands.

46:56.231 --> 46:58.566
How in character.

46:58.608 --> 47:01.069
Exorbitant salary.
Same for your team.

47:01.110 --> 47:02.737
Office space,

47:02.779 --> 47:04.239
in the Flatiron Building,
no less.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.282
Security clearance.
Indemnity clause.

47:06.324 --> 47:08.034
Legal protection.

47:08.076 --> 47:10.453
A formal guarantee that
Homelander will be prosecuted

47:10.495 --> 47:12.622
under the full extent
of the law.

47:14.040 --> 47:15.583
Any of that a problem?

47:15.625 --> 47:17.835
No, gonna pass it up the chain.

47:17.877 --> 47:20.547
And, uh, while they hash it out,

47:20.588 --> 47:23.174
you and I go forward
on good faith.

47:23.216 --> 47:25.343
(Butcher chuckles)

47:25.385 --> 47:27.345
I'm fresh out of good faith.

47:27.387 --> 47:28.846
Now, you and I both know

47:28.888 --> 47:31.099
that you can rubber-stamp
all of that.

47:31.140 --> 47:32.850
So what's it gonna be...

47:32.892 --> 47:34.310
Deputy Director?

47:34.352 --> 47:36.771
I can give you...

47:36.813 --> 47:39.566
everything you want
on this list...

47:39.607 --> 47:41.359
Except?

47:41.401 --> 47:44.404
Except Homelander.

47:48.992 --> 47:50.994
You know what he's done.

47:55.456 --> 47:57.208
(sighs)

48:02.755 --> 48:04.424
I sympathize.

48:05.466 --> 48:06.801
I really do.

48:06.843 --> 48:08.720
-But it's suicide.
-Yeah, well,

48:08.761 --> 48:11.598
-that's a small fucking price
to pay, isn't it?
-Not for you.

48:11.639 --> 48:14.392
For thousands of people
if you push him too hard.

48:14.434 --> 48:16.394
You're fucking scared.

48:16.436 --> 48:18.354
I'm fucking terrified.

48:18.396 --> 48:20.398
And you should be, too.

48:26.946 --> 48:27.947
Butcher!

48:29.157 --> 48:31.159
Butcher!

48:32.785 --> 48:34.787
(sighs)

48:50.470 --> 48:52.805
NARRATOR:
This small-town girl-next-door

48:52.847 --> 48:54.599
wanted to change the world.

48:54.641 --> 48:56.351
STARLIGHT:
Since when did hopeful

48:56.392 --> 48:59.312
and naive become
the same thing?

48:59.354 --> 49:01.731
NARRATOR:
But the world had other plans.

49:01.773 --> 49:03.441
DEEP:
Starlight,

49:03.483 --> 49:04.442
I hope you can forgive me.

49:04.484 --> 49:06.235
NARRATOR:
Battered and beaten,

49:06.277 --> 49:09.280
a phoenix rose from the ashes
with a message so loud,

49:09.322 --> 49:14.369
so raw, it couldn't come forth
as anything less than a roar.

49:14.410 --> 49:16.537
Witness her power.

49:16.579 --> 49:18.498
Hear her truth.

49:18.539 --> 49:20.708
And I'm done taking
any more shit.

49:20.750 --> 49:22.877
NARRATOR:
Watch her stand up

49:22.919 --> 49:25.296
and fight back for all of us.

49:25.338 --> 49:28.841
Citizen Starlight,
coming this fall from Vought.

49:28.883 --> 49:32.178
-♪ You're gonna hear me roar. ♪
-The house always wins.

49:36.933 --> 49:38.976
I'm sorry.

49:50.947 --> 49:52.240
MAN (on TV):
While little is known about...

49:52.281 --> 49:54.242
(continues indistinctly)

49:54.283 --> 49:56.577
...the blacktip reef sharks
can be found mating

49:56.619 --> 49:58.037
in the summer months

49:58.079 --> 50:00.373
off the coast
of Northern Australia.

50:00.415 --> 50:03.835
I know you want
to go back to your brother.

50:07.338 --> 50:10.591
But the people
who did this to you--

50:10.633 --> 50:14.095
you know, they might be doing it
to others.

50:14.137 --> 50:16.222
We can use your help
stopping them.

50:16.264 --> 50:18.266
(TV playing in background)

50:19.851 --> 50:22.228
(sighs)

50:24.397 --> 50:26.357
It's your choice.

50:26.399 --> 50:30.987
You give me a nod, and we go
to the airport right now.

50:31.028 --> 50:34.115
MAN (on TV):
And is following her closely

50:34.157 --> 50:36.451
in hopes of securing a mate.

50:36.492 --> 50:38.661
When the female returns
his feelings,

50:38.703 --> 50:40.621
she will swim slowly

50:40.663 --> 50:42.707
in a sinusoidal pattern...

50:48.045 --> 50:50.006
MOTHER'S MILK:
No.

50:50.047 --> 50:53.009
Baby, why you want
to do me like that?

50:53.050 --> 50:54.886
'Cause if you watch that episode
of Downton Abbey,

50:54.927 --> 50:56.512
-then I'm gonna be one behind...
-(door opens)

50:56.554 --> 50:58.222
and we're not gonna be able
to binge-watch together.

50:58.264 --> 50:59.640
-(door closes)
-Just-just hold off

50:59.682 --> 51:01.309
until I get home.

51:01.350 --> 51:03.269
Uhp, there's a fight
in the yard, baby.

51:03.311 --> 51:05.938
I got to go. All right.

51:05.980 --> 51:07.899
How'd it go with Raynor?

51:07.940 --> 51:09.984
BUTCHER:
No dice.

51:10.026 --> 51:11.402
What?

51:11.444 --> 51:13.905
BUTCHER:
Said she got cold feet.

51:13.946 --> 51:16.032
Well, why?
Did you tell her everything?

51:16.073 --> 51:19.452
Yeah, I laid it all out,
even the sample of V.

51:19.494 --> 51:21.454
Said she couldn't
fucking authorize

51:21.496 --> 51:23.206
that kind of action
against Vought.

51:23.247 --> 51:25.541
Too much of a risk.

51:25.583 --> 51:28.211
Hmm. Did she?

51:28.252 --> 51:30.087
Fucking spineless cunt.

51:30.129 --> 51:32.089
So we are royally fucked.

51:33.090 --> 51:35.051
No, we ain't.

51:35.092 --> 51:37.178
Fuck 'em.

51:37.220 --> 51:39.180
We don't need 'em.

51:39.222 --> 51:43.601
We got everyone and everything
we need right here in this room.

51:43.643 --> 51:47.063
We'll take down Vought
ourselves. Yeah?

51:47.104 --> 51:48.981
Yeah.

51:51.442 --> 51:53.069
Where's Hughie?

51:53.110 --> 51:55.071
-(panting)
-(line ringing)

51:55.112 --> 51:56.989
TINA:
This is Tina Mitchell,

51:57.031 --> 51:58.991
Department of Child Protection
and Permanency.

51:59.033 --> 52:01.035
-Leave a message.
-(beep)

52:01.077 --> 52:03.120
Tina, um, it's Mesmer.

52:03.162 --> 52:04.956
You met me earlier.

52:04.997 --> 52:06.749
(panting)

52:06.791 --> 52:08.668
Um...

52:08.709 --> 52:12.505
Cleo, uh, didn't really
want to see me today.

52:12.547 --> 52:14.674
She was just being polite.

52:16.884 --> 52:19.428
I'm pretty good at reading stuff
like that, so...

52:20.763 --> 52:23.057
Um, you-you don't have
to-to call me,

52:23.099 --> 52:25.768
um, or any of that anymore.

52:27.061 --> 52:29.021
Just, um... it's-it's okay.

52:29.063 --> 52:32.316
Just... just... please...

52:32.358 --> 52:34.777
uh, look after her.

52:35.820 --> 52:37.822
Thank you.

52:41.158 --> 52:42.994
(panting)

52:44.036 --> 52:46.038
(panting)

52:47.415 --> 52:50.042
I'm sorry.
The, uh, elevator was out.

52:51.544 --> 52:54.297
Um, you...
you probably don't remember,

52:54.338 --> 52:55.840
but, um, we've met before.

52:57.258 --> 52:59.886
Oh, I...
I would never try and read you.

52:59.927 --> 53:01.345
Let's be clear.

53:01.387 --> 53:03.556
I don't know you,

53:03.598 --> 53:05.600
and I don't want to.

53:07.018 --> 53:09.228
A-Train said
that you have some information.

53:09.270 --> 53:11.898
Yeah, we, um... we go back
to the Teenage Kix days.

53:11.939 --> 53:14.108
-We-we still keep in touch.
-Oh, golly gee shucks.

53:14.150 --> 53:17.111
What makes you think I would
give two fucks about that?

53:17.153 --> 53:20.990
Now, do you have something
for me or not?

53:21.032 --> 53:23.159
MESMER:
Yeah.

53:23.200 --> 53:27.121
He said you were looking
for a, um, French guy...

53:27.163 --> 53:31.167
and a black guy...

53:31.208 --> 53:33.085
a skinny white guy,

53:33.127 --> 53:35.129
British guy.

53:36.172 --> 53:38.132
Where are these from?

53:38.174 --> 53:42.011
Shitty little $85 camera
I put in my doorbell casing.

53:42.053 --> 53:44.388
I know there's no reward,
but I was hoping

53:44.430 --> 53:47.141
you could put in a word for me
at Vought?

53:47.183 --> 53:49.268
I'll take any posting.

53:49.310 --> 53:52.313
Uh, low five-figures
would be fine.

53:54.690 --> 53:57.193
I just want to be one
of the good guys again.

54:09.246 --> 54:10.957
(whooshing)

54:11.999 --> 54:14.543
Oh, that's my phone.

54:14.585 --> 54:17.213
-(crowd chatter)
-(music playing)

54:17.254 --> 54:19.215
STARLIGHT:
I mean, I don't remember,

54:19.256 --> 54:22.093
but my mom said
that when I was born,

54:22.134 --> 54:23.844
I almost blinded the doctor.

54:23.886 --> 54:26.597
So, I had powers from the start.

54:26.639 --> 54:28.057
Why?

54:28.099 --> 54:31.185
No, no, I'm just, uh, curious.

54:31.227 --> 54:33.229
Mm.

54:33.270 --> 54:35.231
Do you mind if we just...

54:35.272 --> 54:37.316
not talk
about hero stuff tonight?

54:37.358 --> 54:39.318
Yeah, yeah. Bad day at work?

54:39.360 --> 54:41.988
Yeah. It's an understatement.

54:42.029 --> 54:44.657
You know,

54:44.699 --> 54:47.326
there's this beach
in the Bahamas

54:47.368 --> 54:49.912
where the sand is pink,

54:49.954 --> 54:52.456
like, cotton-candy pink.

54:52.498 --> 54:53.582
What's it called?

54:53.624 --> 54:54.667
Pink Sands.

54:54.709 --> 54:55.751
(both laugh)

54:55.793 --> 54:58.004
It's not
the most creative name,

54:58.045 --> 55:00.798
but... let's just go.

55:00.840 --> 55:02.800
Yeah. No, I can, uh...

55:02.842 --> 55:04.677
learn how to play
the steel drum.

55:04.719 --> 55:06.595
You can get cornrows.

55:06.637 --> 55:07.847
How about tonight?

55:07.888 --> 55:09.181
Book that ticket.

55:12.351 --> 55:15.146
Are...
are we talking about this?

55:16.188 --> 55:18.315
I don't know. I...

55:18.357 --> 55:20.359
I just know that,

55:20.401 --> 55:23.362
for me, New York has been such

55:23.404 --> 55:26.490
an endless shit show.

55:26.532 --> 55:28.743
Except for you.

55:31.203 --> 55:33.205
Somehow, in the middle
of it all...

55:36.500 --> 55:38.502
...you found me.

56:06.113 --> 56:08.199
BUTCHER:
Hughie.

56:10.576 --> 56:12.703
I thought that was you.

56:12.745 --> 56:14.705
Ha. Oh.

56:14.747 --> 56:16.123
Oh, I apologize.

56:16.165 --> 56:17.583
I didn't mean to interrupt.

56:17.625 --> 56:19.001
No. (chuckles)

56:19.043 --> 56:20.669
Hi, I'm Annie.

56:20.711 --> 56:22.338
Billy. Old mate of Hughie's.

56:22.379 --> 56:23.923
Ah, boy, you really...

56:23.964 --> 56:26.008
You have a lot of friends
showing up here.

56:26.050 --> 56:27.802
Yeah.

56:27.843 --> 56:29.220
Seems like it.

56:29.261 --> 56:32.723
You're that new girl
in The Seven, ain't you?

56:32.765 --> 56:34.266
Guilty.

56:34.308 --> 56:36.352
Wow. It is a pleasure
to meet you.

56:36.393 --> 56:38.395
And I must say
how marvelous it is

56:38.437 --> 56:40.940
that so many more women are
in positions of power.

56:40.981 --> 56:42.650
-You know what I mean?
-Mm.

56:42.691 --> 56:45.945
You know,
i-if I'm perfectly honest,

56:45.986 --> 56:48.864
Translucent's always been
my favorite.

56:48.906 --> 56:50.658
What's he up to?

56:50.699 --> 56:52.993
I think he's on a mission.

56:53.035 --> 56:55.454
BUTCHER:
Huh. Yeah, I think
I read that, actually.

56:55.496 --> 56:57.373
He's been gone a long time,
though, hasn't he?

56:57.414 --> 57:00.209
I do hope he's all right.

57:01.252 --> 57:02.878
You know what?

57:02.920 --> 57:04.880
I'm gonna go...
get us a pitcher.

57:04.922 --> 57:07.258
-Ah.
-Billy, you like...

57:07.299 --> 57:08.676
Let me guess.
Guinness?

57:08.717 --> 57:10.803
-I like what you like.
-(both laugh)

57:10.845 --> 57:13.139
All right. Be right back.

57:14.682 --> 57:17.434
-Well, well, well.
-Butcher...

57:17.476 --> 57:19.895
She's quite tasty
up close and personal.

57:19.937 --> 57:22.022
-I get what you see in her.
-That wasn't what...

57:22.064 --> 57:24.024
I thought
we had an understanding.

57:24.066 --> 57:25.401
We do. We do.

57:25.442 --> 57:28.237
-It... It's not what...
-Not what it looks like?

57:28.279 --> 57:30.531
'Cause from where I'm sitting,
it looks like

57:30.573 --> 57:33.576
you've got your tongue halfway
down the opposition's throat.

57:33.617 --> 57:35.870
She is not the opposition.

57:37.746 --> 57:40.374
She's a good person, okay?

57:40.416 --> 57:41.709
I mean, she could help us.

57:41.750 --> 57:43.627
-Help us?
-Yeah.

57:46.338 --> 57:48.465
And what do you think
she's gonna do

57:48.507 --> 57:51.468
when she finds out
you murdered Translucent?

57:53.137 --> 57:55.139
When she finds out?

57:59.977 --> 58:02.229
Give her my best.
