WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:04.087
<i>Previously on</i> Billions.

00:04.087 --> 00:05.672
Welcome home, Bobby.

00:05.672 --> 00:07.757
I think there's a mutiny
in the works.

00:07.757 --> 00:10.176
Let's go to the videotape.
We record everything.

00:10.176 --> 00:12.470
<i>I guess it's always
important to keep a close eye</i>

00:12.470 --> 00:14.639
when your people are really
your kidnap victims.

00:14.639 --> 00:16.182
No, Axe, not a close eye.

00:16.182 --> 00:18.101
A thousand eyes and ears,

00:18.101 --> 00:20.186
and the software
to make sense of it all.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.855
There is an order to things.

00:21.855 --> 00:25.025
Learn of a crime,
investigate, confirm, announce.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.193
And I assure you,
we will find crimes.

00:27.193 --> 00:29.863
Fruit of a poison tree
called Michael Prince.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.365
This is a drive
that cannot be copied.

00:32.365 --> 00:33.867
It contains a cataloguing

00:33.867 --> 00:35.493
of moves I have made,

00:35.493 --> 00:37.203
extralegal and plain illegal.

00:37.203 --> 00:39.497
Would get me disbarred
and jailed

00:39.497 --> 00:41.041
if it were to come out.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.584
You got a way
to separate his cash

00:42.584 --> 00:44.377
from all the people
who work there for him

00:44.377 --> 00:45.879
before you A-bomb his shit?

00:45.879 --> 00:48.715
- There is no way.
- Like it, don't love it.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.051
What we need specifically
is for you to reset

00:51.051 --> 00:52.969
the parameters
on the risk algo.

00:52.969 --> 00:55.472
We have a time frame.
It's right fucking now.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.307
Bobby, you need
to reach Dunlop.

00:57.307 --> 00:58.975
Offer her whatever you can.

00:58.975 --> 01:00.977
<i>Make sure she doesn't do
the wrong thing.</i>

01:00.977 --> 01:02.729
Axe, you're impressive,
but this is something

01:02.729 --> 01:04.397
I've worked my whole life for.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.899
Then don't barter that dream

01:05.899 --> 01:07.317
to a guy so transactional

01:07.317 --> 01:09.069
he'll sell VP for your support.

01:10.445 --> 01:11.988
I've made my decision

01:11.988 --> 01:13.490
to not only throw my support

01:13.490 --> 01:16.242
behind our next president,
Mike Prince,

01:16.242 --> 01:18.995
but to become his partner,
his vice president,

01:18.995 --> 01:21.581
for the good of our country
and the whole world.

01:22.582 --> 01:25.460
You're on the briefings, Mike.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.796
- We're going to Camp David.
- Boom.

01:51.861 --> 01:53.154
<i>Hoo-hoo</i>

01:57.408 --> 01:59.410
<i>This here's a story
About Billy Joe</i>

01:59.410 --> 02:01.621
<i>And Bobbie Sue</i>

02:01.621 --> 02:05.959
<i>Two young lovers
With nothing better to do</i>

02:07.335 --> 02:09.295
<i>Than sit around the house</i>

02:09.295 --> 02:12.090
<i>Get high
And watch the tube</i>

02:12.090 --> 02:13.800
Cardamom bun.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.472
Fuck, Ryan.

02:19.472 --> 02:20.932
That's good.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.475
My take on La Cabra's,

02:22.475 --> 02:23.977
which is really their take
on one I ate

02:23.977 --> 02:26.104
at Juno the Bakery
in Copenhagen.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.647
Thanks for sending me
on that trip, Axe,

02:27.647 --> 02:29.607
and for bringing me back
on board.

02:29.607 --> 02:31.109
Worth it.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.652
Those buns are no joke.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.654
Thanks, Chef Ryan.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.447
<i>Hoo-hoo-hoo</i>

02:36.447 --> 02:38.867
<i>Go on,
Take the money and run</i>

02:41.202 --> 02:43.788
<i>Go on,
Take the money and run</i>

02:44.747 --> 02:46.332
<i>Hoo-hoo-hoo</i>

02:46.332 --> 02:48.418
<i>Go on,
Take the money and run</i>

02:50.879 --> 02:53.464
<i>Go on,
Take the money and run</i>

02:54.549 --> 02:56.009
<i>Hoo-hoo-hoo</i>

02:56.009 --> 02:58.136
<i>Billy Mack is a detective</i>

02:58.136 --> 02:59.304
<i>Down in Texas</i>

02:59.304 --> 03:01.514
So... game day, huh?

03:04.350 --> 03:08.271
Ryan! Bring Sacker a bun!
She needs to be fortified!

03:08.271 --> 03:10.607
- And a coffee, please.
- Coffee!

03:28.333 --> 03:30.877
I love that you're ditching
your race for Congress.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.462
I am?

03:32.462 --> 03:34.881
As much as we need you there,
we need you here.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.217
Besides, not enough
hand sanitizer in the world

03:37.217 --> 03:38.635
to make me do that job.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.555
You should go long Purell.
I'm not ditching a thing.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.390
But you're still here?

03:44.390 --> 03:46.893
My filing deadline's
months away.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.394
But Prince's campaign's
days away

03:48.394 --> 03:50.104
from becoming
a black hole.

03:50.104 --> 03:52.440
Everything in its vicinity,
sucked right in.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.359
You'll just be part
of the fabric of the thing,

03:54.359 --> 03:57.737
unable to assert yourself
as anything other than

03:57.737 --> 03:59.572
Prince's fill-in-the-blank.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.532
All because he's about
to throw down a gauntlet?

04:01.532 --> 04:03.076
More of a grenade,

04:03.076 --> 04:05.203
at the parties
you'll need to nominate you.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.664
So I establish a little distance
when I leave, is all.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.165
With your family dough?

04:09.165 --> 04:10.625
With the whitest collar background

04:10.625 --> 04:12.752
of anyone at the firm?

04:12.752 --> 04:14.921
Ask Chang and Eng.

04:14.921 --> 04:18.258
Not a lot of distance
when you're joined at the hip.

04:30.228 --> 04:32.021
What the fuck
are you doing here?

04:32.021 --> 04:34.023
Sacker called to meet.
Not you too?

04:34.023 --> 04:35.984
Yep. She called me to meet.

04:37.318 --> 04:39.445
Shit.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.828
Oh, this isn't good.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.664
My favorite burger in the city.

04:49.664 --> 04:52.083
But now I have lost my appetite.

04:52.083 --> 04:55.044
Yeah, this isn't good at all.
She's onto us. Has to be.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.642
This is fucked
that I have to do this.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.185
Speak it aloud.

05:11.185 --> 05:13.938
- I'm onto you.
- No way.

05:13.938 --> 05:16.190
I'm pretty sure I know
what you three have been up to.

05:16.190 --> 05:18.985
Or, more accurately,
that you're up to something.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.654
That bullshit
on the elevator a few hours ago

05:21.654 --> 05:23.281
was the final tip-off, Wags.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.158
The why matters more
than the what, Kate.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.328
I came here
because I respect you all.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.830
But I work for Prince.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.749
He took the shot on me.

05:32.749 --> 05:35.126
So you have about one minute
to convince me of that "why"

05:35.126 --> 05:37.045
before I turn your asses in.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.589
Give me three.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.688
You hear anything unusual
on your side?

05:55.688 --> 05:58.149
Total focus on security
and safety

05:58.149 --> 06:00.943
and surveillance and protection:
the new norm.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.196
Philip is the only one able
to make decisions,

06:03.196 --> 06:04.447
so it's quiet.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.698
Quiet is good.

06:25.176 --> 06:27.887
We're here to set the terms
for the performance reviews.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.890
Should we wait until Philip
is here before we start?

06:30.890 --> 06:32.642
He's not coming.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.832
We could have talked
at the office.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.333
But apparently
you've stopped showing up

06:57.333 --> 06:59.127
and taken to day drinking.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.421
Yeah, the office is not a place
I can be right now.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.883
No?

07:08.219 --> 07:10.096
I can't live with it.

07:10.096 --> 07:13.057
Mike Prince rising
off the rubble of Marc Ruloff.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.809
Professor Ruloff
didn't deserve that.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.727
And yes, sure,

07:16.727 --> 07:18.938
I know the old man Eastwood
quote that guys in the industry

07:18.938 --> 07:22.275
love to say when they screw
the other party on a deal:

07:22.275 --> 07:24.277
"Deserve's got nothing
to do with it."

07:24.277 --> 07:26.028
And I don't want to keep
making money for someone

07:26.028 --> 07:27.655
who buys into all that.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.615
But I don't know
what to do about it.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.242
I do.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.785
I know exactly
what you can do about it,

07:32.785 --> 07:34.454
something that needs to be done

07:34.454 --> 07:36.914
because he won't stop
just ruining businesses

07:36.914 --> 07:39.792
and lone men like your
favorite professor. And...

07:41.461 --> 07:44.046
I know you know this on a deep,
subconscious level.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.803
But first, we're gonna have
to play out a scene

07:50.803 --> 07:52.305
back at my office.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.939
Prince should be
at Camp David soon.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.900
Once he gets there,
he may have to wait a while,

08:03.900 --> 08:06.402
'cause the president
waits for no one.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.438
Your man is rolling in.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.856
I'll let you know
when he's done.

08:43.856 --> 08:45.191
Thanks, Hall.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.195
He's nine minutes out.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.822
That should give us between
90 minutes and two hours.

08:51.822 --> 08:55.701
Chuck, I guess you should go
stop those leaks.

08:55.701 --> 08:58.287
- Indeed, sir.
- If I had a cue, that's it.

08:58.287 --> 09:00.081
Better get over there.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.832
Yep. Time to open up
the side door.

09:01.832 --> 09:03.209
I'll get to it.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.808
Morning, sir.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.893
I have Candidate Prince for
a meeting with the president.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.937
Also attending, Scooter Dunbar.
And I'm Bradford Luke.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.313
Yes, sir, I have you.

09:24.313 --> 09:26.566
I'll need all your IDs
and phones.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.741
All clear.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.542
We are about
to embark on something

09:44.542 --> 09:46.752
that we cannot afford
to have confirmed

09:46.752 --> 09:50.256
by sources in this office
before we're sure.

09:50.256 --> 09:54.552
And so I will be noting
each and every one of you here.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.554
And if it does leak,

09:56.554 --> 10:00.099
I will assume it came
from one, two, three of you,

10:00.099 --> 10:03.269
and all will go down.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.895
What US Attorney Rhoades
is doing here

10:04.895 --> 10:07.356
is giving you an opportunity
to let us know

10:07.356 --> 10:10.109
- before that happens.
- In many organizations

10:10.109 --> 10:12.069
such as ours
in other countries,

10:12.069 --> 10:14.405
they have whole
mini organizations

10:14.405 --> 10:19.410
designed to spot this kind
of betrayal and punish it.

10:19.410 --> 10:23.456
Do I have a similar,
tight-knit operation going?

10:23.456 --> 10:26.626
I'd tell you,
but then I'd be leaking.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.794
We have a source
who has shared information

10:28.794 --> 10:32.423
that six of the largest
U.S. natural gas companies

10:32.423 --> 10:35.635
have been colluding with
and price fixing alongside of

10:35.635 --> 10:38.095
Russia, China, and Iran.

10:39.513 --> 10:41.849
We are prioritizing
this investigation,

10:41.849 --> 10:43.643
and because it threatens

10:43.643 --> 10:45.811
the country's entire
energy infrastructure,

10:45.811 --> 10:50.816
we shall do so
with stealth and rigor.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.408
I know we've had
our differences of late

10:59.408 --> 11:01.452
on how this office
should function,

11:01.452 --> 11:03.329
but I think you'll agree
that finding out

11:03.329 --> 11:05.456
if there's been malfeasance
by the energy sector

11:05.456 --> 11:08.918
and these companies
is exactly what we're here for.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.795
And if you will take it on,

11:10.795 --> 11:15.174
I promise you,
we will act on what you learn.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.304
Okay.

11:20.304 --> 11:21.597
I'm on it.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.201
My part is done.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.703
The algo will now zig
when it used to zag.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.830
So, if all the rest
goes according to plan--

11:45.830 --> 11:48.165
Yeah, that's the if.

11:48.165 --> 11:52.253
You know,
when all this is over,

11:52.253 --> 11:55.715
I want you back with me,
running things.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.633
It always feels like this
between us at first

11:57.633 --> 11:59.009
because of the mind-meld thing.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.221
But then something happens.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.224
I think it'd be different now.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.892
I'm different. You are.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.687
We have a concrete goal
in mind for you,

12:09.687 --> 12:11.522
so there'd be a defined exit.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.566
Then you could go do
all the positive things

12:13.566 --> 12:15.234
that you're destined for.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.069
Won't be forever.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.572
But I think it'd be very,
very good for everyone.

12:21.407 --> 12:24.785
You and me,
together again, kid.

12:26.203 --> 12:28.330
I'll give it
real consideration.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.833
You do that.

12:45.806 --> 12:48.893
The president's been looking
forward to this, Mr. Prince.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.603
We should be up at the cabin
in a few minutes.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.979
Sounds good.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.989
All capital's now deployed.

13:01.989 --> 13:04.116
Thank God
we're off the sidelines.

13:04.116 --> 13:07.119
Not that we can make shit
in this low-margin stuff.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.454
Hey, it's what
the algo dictated,

13:08.454 --> 13:09.955
it's what we got.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.207
Chill and scroll
Variant News

13:11.207 --> 13:12.374
for ideas or something.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.470
Something is amiss
at the Circle K.

13:24.470 --> 13:28.808
As in, there is cash
in a long-dormant account.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.309
A lot of cash.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.478
All funds are invested.
What account?

13:32.478 --> 13:33.896
Unclear.

13:37.274 --> 13:39.610
Must be some reserve
the algo dictated

13:39.610 --> 13:41.320
be held back
for optimum timing.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.863
And Mike and Scooter
mentioned something about it.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.156
I'll check it out.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.783
I also couldn't help but notice

13:45.783 --> 13:47.993
a bit of a concentration
in the energy sector

13:47.993 --> 13:49.328
in the portfolio.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.538
We should alert the brass.

13:50.538 --> 13:51.831
You're into allocation now?

13:51.831 --> 13:53.958
A falcon sees what he sees.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.001
You sound like someone
who thinks they know better

13:56.001 --> 13:57.628
than the Trojan Defense algorithm.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.213
Maybe you should
have a meeting about that

13:59.213 --> 14:00.881
with leadership
when they're back.

14:11.725 --> 14:13.686
The press start whacking
the sector yet?

14:13.686 --> 14:15.521
No. It's quiet so far.

14:15.521 --> 14:16.939
This whole thing
doesn't work if--

14:16.939 --> 14:18.357
Chuck will get it done.

14:19.775 --> 14:21.485
Hold up.

14:21.485 --> 14:23.195
Posts are starting to hit.

14:23.195 --> 14:26.532
Fintwit and the other socials
are getting into the act.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.826
Business press, the FJ,
bulletins are landing.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.369
- There we go.
- Nice.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.121
They're starting
to take bets on sanctions,

14:32.121 --> 14:34.999
and when CEOs are gonna
get hauled in front of Congress.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.542
That must be setting off
some alarm bells

14:36.542 --> 14:37.877
over at Mike Prince Capital, huh?

14:37.877 --> 14:39.378
The account's
available to you.

14:39.378 --> 14:40.671
You poised and ready
for when it's time?

14:40.671 --> 14:42.381
Hell yes, I'm ready.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.716
I'm as sharp as a bell.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.384
I mean, as clear as a--

14:45.384 --> 14:46.886
We know what you mean.

14:48.554 --> 14:51.765
The stories about collusion
in the natural gas sector

14:51.765 --> 14:53.934
are starting to hit
the financial press.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.853
Ain't that the way it goes.

14:55.853 --> 14:58.314
You tell a group of people,
government attorneys no less,

14:58.314 --> 15:00.316
to be quiet about something,
and it's on the news sites

15:00.316 --> 15:01.650
20 minutes later.

15:01.650 --> 15:04.695
- Wouldn't you know it.
- Shocked.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.071
We'll get a fainting couch
moved in.

15:09.742 --> 15:13.162
It's like, if I could turn this
fucking Bloomberg upside down,

15:13.162 --> 15:15.581
all the positions would be
headed in the right direction.

15:15.581 --> 15:18.083
These are major fucking hits
we are taking.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.877
What can we blow out of
right now?

15:19.877 --> 15:21.754
I'm checking the risk algo.
This'll self-correct.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.422
We are well within
the parameters.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.424
Self-correct my ass.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.427
Nat gas stocks are cratering,
pulling us down with them.

15:28.427 --> 15:31.180
This bloodbath gets any worse,
they're gonna halt these stocks.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.723
There's no way the exchange

15:32.723 --> 15:34.391
wants to answer
to the SEC on this.

15:34.391 --> 15:36.602
- We gotta make moves.
- Our moves are prescribed.

15:36.602 --> 15:39.271
We've got the infant car seat
of algos protecting us.

15:39.271 --> 15:40.856
Just hang tight
for the turnaround.

15:47.446 --> 15:48.864
Presenting Kate Sacker,

15:48.864 --> 15:51.116
formerly of
the Southern District.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.077
Formerly of
the attorney general's office.

15:53.077 --> 15:57.247
Presently general counsel
of Michael Prince Capital.

16:14.014 --> 16:17.685
Miss Sacker, it occurs to me
that in a very short time,

16:17.685 --> 16:21.438
your political prospects
will be in tatters.

16:21.438 --> 16:26.360
But turning that around
need not be a laborious process.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.987
You have ideas on that front?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.571
I do.

16:29.571 --> 16:31.407
The very fact that you
were willing

16:31.407 --> 16:33.659
to sacrifice your ambitions
marks you

16:33.659 --> 16:36.996
as the exact person
we all need in office.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.832
It's who you were
when we first met.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.334
And you've found
your way back.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.461
So, what's the path?

16:44.461 --> 16:47.006
Because you're the person
I want guiding me now.

16:48.966 --> 16:52.302
The path would entail a return
to SDNY, a pay cut,

16:52.302 --> 16:55.180
and perhaps some more sedate

16:55.180 --> 16:57.433
clothing choices, unfortunately.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.268
But some high-profile cases.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.561
Crusader-type stuff.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.354
You can have your pick.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.648
The kind of cases that bolster
and burnish a reputation.

17:04.648 --> 17:07.026
The kind that people
in these offices

17:07.026 --> 17:10.029
have been using as
a springboard for generations.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.157
Pencil me in.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.245
You crusaded to make
this happen, and now it will.

17:18.245 --> 17:19.788
Our visitor is here?
That's the knock?

17:19.788 --> 17:21.790
Believe so.
You want to open it?

17:21.790 --> 17:24.710
Well, he knows the way in.
You know the way in! Come on in.

17:29.381 --> 17:34.178
I did not expect to hear
your voice or see you, Kate.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.388
Chuck didn't mention it
with the invite.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.557
Wouldn't be a surprise party
without the surprise.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.726
Or without gifts.

17:50.944 --> 17:54.239
You guys went and did it.
You reinstated my law license.

17:54.239 --> 17:58.077
Somehow got around the mandatory
seven-year wait.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.579
Uh, we might've hurried
the process along a bit, yes.

18:00.579 --> 18:04.083
But you applied
and got the recommendations

18:04.083 --> 18:06.168
and did the work.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.378
But you paid the fee,
didn't you?

18:08.378 --> 18:10.255
Who knows?
Important thing, it's paid.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.135
I'm moved.

18:15.135 --> 18:18.972
I find this... moving.

18:18.972 --> 18:21.350
We look forward to seeing you
across the aisle in court.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.768
I don't.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.770
Yeah, let's just... not.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.237
Before you quit that hibachi,

18:33.237 --> 18:35.614
save Chuck and me a seat
for one last fantail shrimp.

18:38.075 --> 18:40.619
You know, fantail shrimp
are a different thing.

18:40.619 --> 18:43.122
One's a Chinese delicacy,
the other--

18:43.122 --> 18:47.543
Oh, you...
know that, don't you?

18:47.543 --> 18:50.129
Okay. Bye. Thanks for this.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.797
Bye.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.269
That was really...

19:06.562 --> 19:08.063
If someone asks me
if anything fazes me,

19:08.063 --> 19:10.482
I can no longer say
I am unfazed.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.401
That fazed me.

19:12.401 --> 19:13.986
Never get used to it.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.822
- Pretty G-D cool.
- Sir? Your phones.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.534
Gentlemen.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.792
Uh, you're a few minutes late

19:28.792 --> 19:31.128
for me to ask the president
to pardon you, Axe.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.130
No, Mike,
I am right on time.

19:33.130 --> 19:35.090
And I'm glad
you got your audience,

19:35.090 --> 19:37.342
'cause that's the closest
you'll get to that office.

19:37.342 --> 19:40.095
Welcome to the first day
of the rest of your life.

19:40.095 --> 19:43.932
Mike. Look, Mike.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.934
Well, that can't be right.
That's got to be a hack.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.352
- It says--
- Yeah.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.188
That the entire portfolio
is wiped out.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.857
Whatever you think you're doing,
it's not gonna work.

19:51.857 --> 19:55.068
Not "doing," Mike. Done.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.121
Getting into the portfolio now.

20:06.121 --> 20:08.040
Have the chopper blades spinning
when we get there.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.667
Scooter, you'll go from
the heliport right to the SEC,

20:10.667 --> 20:12.211
- get this cleared up.
- Got it.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.797
It's not letting me
do anything.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.218
I'm locked out.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.510
Drive!

20:27.100 --> 20:28.769
- Fun.
- Well, it's about that time.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.021
- I'm ready.
- This part should be--

20:31.021 --> 20:32.731
- Exhilarating?
- Delightful?

20:32.731 --> 20:36.610
I was gonna say "fucking nuts,"
but yeah, all of it.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.820
Yep. Let's go.

20:42.324 --> 20:43.575
This is a...

20:44.826 --> 20:47.162
weird thing
to say to a peer, but...

20:48.121 --> 20:49.706
I'm proud of you.

20:49.706 --> 20:53.502
Regardless of whatever
we pull off or don't.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.712
The end result here
isn't really in doubt.

20:57.005 --> 20:58.423
So that's the country's future.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.467
What about your future?

21:01.551 --> 21:02.761
I'd ask you same.

21:05.389 --> 21:08.100
You know, I didn't think
going on as before--

21:08.100 --> 21:11.436
either version of before,
for either of us--

21:11.436 --> 21:12.729
was gonna be an option.

21:12.729 --> 21:15.023
Yes. And yet the temptation.

21:15.023 --> 21:17.067
Isn't that the thing.

21:17.067 --> 21:19.444
You know, if you had looked
at each of us

21:19.444 --> 21:21.029
the day before
we got into this business,

21:21.029 --> 21:22.531
you would have said,
"Ah, there's the one.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.574
There's the thread
that can go

21:24.574 --> 21:27.953
through the smallest eye
of the smallest needle."

21:30.455 --> 21:32.624
- Alas.
- No. Yes. Alas.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.751
But perhaps this gives us
the chance

21:34.751 --> 21:36.295
to pull up out of the nosedive.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.630
Problem is, the money
does the same thing

21:38.630 --> 21:41.550
that flying through the clouds
without instruments does.

21:42.509 --> 21:44.344
You can't tell which way is up,

21:44.344 --> 21:46.346
which is down,

21:46.346 --> 21:48.473
and you don't know you're
spinning until it's too late.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.142
Unless you have a great co-pilot

21:50.142 --> 21:51.518
who's monitoring
the instruments.

21:51.518 --> 21:53.270
Thanks for being mine.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.731
Even when I thought
I wanted to fly solo.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.734
Same, Taylor.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.527
Right back at you.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.494
The chair of the SEC
is expecting you.

22:09.494 --> 22:12.664
You need to go over there
and get on an open line

22:12.664 --> 22:14.166
with the heads
of the exchanges,

22:14.166 --> 22:16.001
and with a steady but firm hand

22:16.001 --> 22:18.962
ensure that no trading halts
are instituted.

22:18.962 --> 22:20.922
And that no trades
are reversed.

22:20.922 --> 22:23.008
To be sure, because no doubt
they'll come asking.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.677
- Demanding.
- That's why you need to do it.

22:25.677 --> 22:30.349
I'll get it all done. And while
I say this with great affection,

22:30.349 --> 22:32.976
I look forward to not
working together with you

22:32.976 --> 22:34.978
for a good long while, Chuck.

22:34.978 --> 22:36.855
As do I, Miss Mahar.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.709
Find me Wendy fucking Rhoades.

23:00.420 --> 23:01.671
She's actually here?

23:13.850 --> 23:16.395
What is so fucking wrong
about me

23:16.395 --> 23:19.898
that you're sure I shouldn't
be fucking president?

23:19.898 --> 23:21.900
Why don't we start
with how you act

23:21.900 --> 23:23.819
when things don't go
your fucking way.

23:23.819 --> 23:27.572
Now multiply that by a factor
of your finger on the trigger.

23:42.003 --> 23:43.880
You can all
do me the courtesy

23:43.880 --> 23:47.300
of getting the fuck
out of my office before...

23:49.970 --> 23:52.806
Another rough-and-tumble day
on Wall Street, I see.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.391
Governor, uh,
much to talk about here,

23:54.391 --> 23:55.976
but I have something
to deal with first.

23:55.976 --> 23:58.019
Not so much, I'm afraid.

23:58.019 --> 23:59.896
Hi, Axe.

23:59.896 --> 24:01.440
I want to thank you
for your counsel.

24:03.608 --> 24:05.735
Oh, shit.

24:07.112 --> 24:11.116
So, aside from the best veal
in the city,

24:11.116 --> 24:13.034
what can you really offer me?

24:13.034 --> 24:15.454
A revived candidacy

24:15.454 --> 24:18.623
and an open road
to the nomination.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.379
Truth is,

24:24.379 --> 24:26.256
whatever he proposes,

24:26.256 --> 24:28.717
I could never be his VP,

24:28.717 --> 24:31.219
because I never want him
to be president.

24:31.219 --> 24:32.929
Not after what he said
about nukes.

24:32.929 --> 24:35.307
The way he never gets there

24:35.307 --> 24:37.476
is by you joining
his ticket now.

24:37.476 --> 24:40.270
When he topples,
you'll move up.

24:40.270 --> 24:42.647
You won't have to wait
very long,

24:42.647 --> 24:44.733
but you got to do it
just as I say.

24:46.818 --> 24:48.862
See, we need to get him
off the grid.

24:52.699 --> 24:54.993
Mike, I'm here
to let you know I'm out,

24:54.993 --> 24:57.537
as in off your ticket.

24:57.537 --> 24:59.498
But very much
still in the race.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.459
I am reaffirming
my own candidacy shortly,

25:02.459 --> 25:04.085
and I'll be taking back
my supporters,

25:04.085 --> 25:05.629
my campaign apparatus.

25:05.629 --> 25:07.964
You're making
a rash decision here.

25:07.964 --> 25:09.841
Bradford,
don't walk out on me.

25:11.551 --> 25:13.428
I'm still a viable candidate.

25:13.428 --> 25:14.846
The nation is ready
to follow me.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.973
You saw me with the president.

25:16.973 --> 25:19.017
I'm ready for this.
It's my time.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.519
I don't think so, Mike.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.145
It's never happened that
the whole premise

25:22.145 --> 25:23.480
for a candidacy
has been erased.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.649
But today... it happened.

25:25.649 --> 25:27.692
You were the self-made
rich candidate,

25:27.692 --> 25:29.694
and now you're not.

25:29.694 --> 25:31.488
There's no coming back
from this.

25:31.488 --> 25:32.948
Not in this election cycle, anyway.

25:32.948 --> 25:34.699
I get it.

25:34.699 --> 25:37.869
The consultant jumps off
the sinking ship like a rat.

25:37.869 --> 25:40.705
Can't catch any air
once you're underwater.

25:40.705 --> 25:42.791
If you find yourself
at loose ends, Bradford,

25:42.791 --> 25:45.669
Wendy Rhoades did tip me
to your skills,

25:45.669 --> 25:47.879
and I have a spot for you.

25:49.172 --> 25:51.049
Were you with them?

25:51.049 --> 25:52.259
Nope.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.053
Nope.

25:56.096 --> 25:58.431
But, uh,
I am going with her.

25:58.431 --> 26:02.143
Well, welcome aboard
a very seaworthy ship.

26:02.143 --> 26:03.853
Glad to be aboard, Governor.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.952
And?

26:18.952 --> 26:20.745
Exchanges won't be halting
any trading.

26:20.745 --> 26:22.956
The SEC won't have the exchanges
reverse the trades.

26:22.956 --> 26:24.708
They're honoring them.

26:24.708 --> 26:27.377
In the face of blatant sabotage
and market manipulation?

26:27.377 --> 26:29.045
They said there was
a federal investigation

26:29.045 --> 26:30.422
into collusion in the sector.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.340
Chuck Rhoades, no doubt.

26:32.340 --> 26:34.509
And that it was their mandate
to protect the counterparties

26:34.509 --> 26:36.094
to all our trades.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.596
Who is the "they"
besides the SEC chair

26:37.596 --> 26:38.930
who's shoveling this shit?

26:38.930 --> 26:40.181
Dave Mahar was there,

26:40.181 --> 26:41.558
in various capacities.

26:41.558 --> 26:43.184
Goddamn fix is in
across the board.

26:46.605 --> 26:50.442
How is it that all of the firm's
capital, levered three to one,

26:50.442 --> 26:52.611
got concentrated
into six nat gas stocks

26:52.611 --> 26:55.363
that all happened
to be under investigation

26:55.363 --> 26:57.449
for an international scandal?

26:57.449 --> 26:59.534
And then we bottom-ticked
the market on the liquidation,

26:59.534 --> 27:01.161
leaving us completely wiped out?

27:01.161 --> 27:02.454
Worse than wiped out.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.164
Actually,
we went negative equity.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.832
The risk management algo
set the parameters

27:05.832 --> 27:09.502
as per your orders, and...
we never disobey.

27:09.502 --> 27:11.713
Must've been a glitch
which, I'm sorry to say, Mike,

27:11.713 --> 27:13.173
lowered us below
our capital reserves,

27:13.173 --> 27:15.008
prompting margin calls.

27:15.008 --> 27:16.843
And the fund was unable
to meet the margin calls

27:16.843 --> 27:19.137
without pledging
the private equity stakes.

27:25.894 --> 27:29.189
This is midnight
at the costume ball.

27:29.189 --> 27:32.734
All masks off.
I know it was you.

27:32.734 --> 27:35.654
You played me
with that loyalty act.

27:36.988 --> 27:38.573
And you, Kate,

27:38.573 --> 27:40.075
you ratted them out to me

27:40.075 --> 27:41.660
so that I'd trust you
and Philip.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.828
And to ferret out
the extent of the surveillance.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.497
You're too smart, Mike.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.998
We knew you'd catch them
sooner or later.

27:46.998 --> 27:48.291
I suggested sooner.

27:48.291 --> 27:49.793
Disbarment be damned.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.503
I turned them in to you.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.005
If you recall, I recommended
you fire the lot of them.

27:54.005 --> 27:55.465
What am I guilty of?

27:55.465 --> 27:57.342
Talking to them
once you decided not to?

27:58.259 --> 28:00.136
How did they convince you?

28:00.136 --> 28:01.846
It couldn't have been money.

28:01.846 --> 28:04.683
Once they got me to see past
my personal interests,

28:04.683 --> 28:07.394
my own political future,

28:07.394 --> 28:09.187
it was clear.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.772
How much did we leave
on the table?

28:10.772 --> 28:12.065
Besides hearts and guts?

28:12.065 --> 28:13.900
How much?

28:13.900 --> 28:16.111
Projections are, by the time
the company's mature--

28:16.111 --> 28:17.737
1.4 billion.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.366
You made sure we lost
a big piece of business

28:21.366 --> 28:23.201
so the authority for
the huge trades would go to Wags

28:23.201 --> 28:24.703
and then to Philip,

28:24.703 --> 28:26.121
the one person I could trust.

28:26.121 --> 28:27.455
Because he's mine.

28:27.455 --> 28:28.957
We lost that helium trade

28:28.957 --> 28:30.500
because we were unable
to do a deal

28:30.500 --> 28:32.252
at that scale
without your sign-off.

28:32.252 --> 28:34.337
What you took from that,
all the subsequent decisions,

28:34.337 --> 28:35.922
those were yours
and yours alone.

28:35.922 --> 28:37.924
I, uh... I hate to interrupt,

28:37.924 --> 28:39.926
but one of my favorite
TV shows is on.

28:41.594 --> 28:43.638
<i>And I heard the rumors, too,</i>

28:43.638 --> 28:45.348
<i>about corruption and collusion</i>

28:45.348 --> 28:47.225
<i>by the top American
natural gas companies</i>

28:47.225 --> 28:49.060
<i>with some hostile nations.</i>

28:49.060 --> 28:50.729
<i>And there were leaks</i>

28:50.729 --> 28:52.731
<i>from various branches
of law enforcement.</i>

28:52.731 --> 28:54.232
<i>But after a penetrating investigation</i>

28:54.232 --> 28:56.401
<i>by the Southern District
of New York,</i>

28:56.401 --> 29:00.238
<i>these vicious rumors
are just that: rumors.</i>

29:00.238 --> 29:02.031
<i>While actors from adversarial
foreign governments</i>

29:02.031 --> 29:04.200
<i>did approach these companies</i>

29:04.200 --> 29:06.578
<i>in an attempt to convince them
to hold back supply</i>

29:06.578 --> 29:08.371
<i>and inflate prices,</i>

29:08.371 --> 29:11.207
<i>these entreaties were rebuffed.</i>

29:11.207 --> 29:12.584
<i>Forcefully.</i>

29:12.584 --> 29:15.962
<i>And so we are closing
this investigation.</i>

29:15.962 --> 29:18.923
<i>These companies
and this sector are healthy.</i>

29:18.923 --> 29:20.550
<i>Robust, even.</i>

29:20.550 --> 29:22.302
<i>Any short-term
collateral damage</i>

29:22.302 --> 29:24.220
<i>that was done is unfortunate,</i>

29:24.220 --> 29:27.348
<i>but that is the nature
of the free market.</i>

29:27.348 --> 29:30.101
Those positions
are all going to rebound...

29:31.102 --> 29:32.395
but you've sold them off.

29:32.395 --> 29:34.481
The algo directed
they be sold off.

29:36.316 --> 29:39.486
My God.
Comanche Gas H.O.D.

29:39.486 --> 29:41.154
Western Plains H.O.D.

29:41.154 --> 29:42.947
Marcellus Shale H.O.D.

29:42.947 --> 29:44.574
All going out
at the high of the day.

29:44.574 --> 29:47.285
And we're completely sold?

29:47.285 --> 29:49.245
<i>As U.S.
Attorney Rhoades mentioned,</i>

29:49.245 --> 29:51.289
<i>there had been some rumors
about collusion.</i>

29:51.289 --> 29:53.416
<i>We did our investigation,
and we were very quickly able</i>

29:53.416 --> 29:55.794
<i>to gain cooperation
from the companies in question,</i>

29:55.794 --> 29:58.630
<i>as they had nothing to hide.</i>

29:58.630 --> 30:00.423
<i>We are going to get
to the source</i>

30:00.423 --> 30:02.091
<i>of these leaks and rumors,
I promise you that.</i>

30:02.091 --> 30:03.301
<i>That is priority one.</i>

30:03.301 --> 30:04.594
<i>I can take specific questions,</i>

30:04.594 --> 30:05.804
<i>as I'm sure there are many.</i>

30:09.766 --> 30:12.477
The last time I was part
of something this sweet,

30:12.477 --> 30:14.270
Gust Avrakotos
and Charlie Wilson

30:14.270 --> 30:15.814
high-fived me
at the end of it.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.607
Not sure even I have
the security clearance

30:17.607 --> 30:18.942
to hear about that one
right now.

30:18.942 --> 30:20.443
If it was anything like this,

30:20.443 --> 30:22.278
it must've floated you
for quite a while.

30:22.278 --> 30:23.988
For a night.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.949
Next day, I was ready
to get back to work.

30:25.949 --> 30:28.785
Which is why I have you two
so close by at all times.

30:28.785 --> 30:30.870
Because I feel much the same.

30:30.870 --> 30:33.206
You know, Chuck, when you talked
me into coming aboard at SDNY,

30:33.206 --> 30:34.791
you promised
I'd feel this way.

30:34.791 --> 30:36.459
Like I actually helped

30:36.459 --> 30:38.378
to do something good.

30:38.378 --> 30:40.672
I want more of it.
Need more.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.549
We all do.

30:42.549 --> 30:44.509
And, like Allerd said,

30:44.509 --> 30:48.054
tomorrow we will get cracking
on just those kinds of projects.

30:48.054 --> 30:50.849
But tonight,
I'm gonna hang with my kids.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.184
Both of you go have fun, rest,
or whatever it is you do

30:53.184 --> 30:54.894
when you're officially
off the clock.

30:54.894 --> 30:56.437
Good call. Karl,

30:56.437 --> 30:58.314
you wanna come grab
dinner with Taiga and me?

30:58.314 --> 31:02.026
Normally I don't like
third-wheeling it, but... yes.

31:02.026 --> 31:04.362
Good. Good. Excellent.

31:04.362 --> 31:07.073
Excellent work all around.

31:12.078 --> 31:14.205
Scooter, I started
with much less.

31:14.205 --> 31:16.332
We both did.

31:16.332 --> 31:19.085
Time to roll it back up again,
my loyal friend.

31:23.590 --> 31:25.216
I'm sure you will, Mike.

31:25.216 --> 31:27.302
But you'll have to do it alone.

31:27.302 --> 31:29.262
It's time for me
to go it on my own.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.765
I can't lose you.

31:32.765 --> 31:34.392
Not now.

31:34.392 --> 31:35.894
If I assess this
for what it is,

31:35.894 --> 31:38.021
it was an expensive lesson--

31:38.021 --> 31:39.564
very expensive--

31:39.564 --> 31:41.858
in hubris and
self-aggrandizement run amok.

31:41.858 --> 31:43.902
You know that's not
what we set out to do.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.195
You know our intentions
were of the highest aims,

31:46.195 --> 31:48.072
despite what those assholes
down there think.

31:48.072 --> 31:50.533
But you have to know
we suffered...

31:50.533 --> 31:52.118
drift, I guess you'd call it.

31:52.118 --> 31:54.203
A degree off
on the compass heading

31:54.203 --> 31:55.622
on a long enough journey,

31:55.622 --> 31:57.457
you end up far
from your destination.

31:57.457 --> 31:59.584
You end up lost. We did.

31:59.584 --> 32:01.252
I did.

32:01.252 --> 32:03.546
I failed to help you steer,

32:03.546 --> 32:05.089
and this is where we've landed.

32:05.089 --> 32:06.674
Broke and broken.

32:06.674 --> 32:10.094
Our mission was righteous.

32:10.094 --> 32:11.930
We just ran into a snag.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.015
Our mission is something
I will be unpacking

32:14.015 --> 32:15.433
for a long time to come.

32:15.433 --> 32:18.436
I can't say I committed
blindly to it.

32:18.436 --> 32:20.396
But I was blinded along the way

32:20.396 --> 32:22.774
by my sense of fealty.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.734
Loyalty to you.

32:24.734 --> 32:28.321
By your generosity,
focus, brilliance.

32:30.156 --> 32:31.699
By our shared history.

32:33.743 --> 32:38.122
In the end, the deal I made
with myself was a someday deal.

32:38.122 --> 32:40.083
And that day came sooner
than I imagined,

32:40.083 --> 32:41.459
and with harsher weather.

32:41.459 --> 32:44.170
But it's here
all the same, so...

32:46.464 --> 32:47.757
Yeah.

32:49.008 --> 32:50.551
Done.

32:57.517 --> 32:59.686
Where does that leave me
after all this?

33:01.396 --> 33:04.983
In a reflective place,
after the swelling goes down.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.443
You accept that this happened.

33:07.443 --> 33:09.237
You figure out why.

33:09.237 --> 33:11.155
You go home and start over.

33:12.865 --> 33:16.911
As it ever has been for men
like you over the centuries.

33:33.678 --> 33:36.180
You've orchestrated this thing

33:36.180 --> 33:38.516
like Phil Spector did
"River Deep."

33:38.516 --> 33:41.894
Perhaps not who I'd have used
to make the point, but, yes,

33:41.894 --> 33:44.355
we put together a wrecking crew
and let them play,

33:44.355 --> 33:45.565
much as he did.

33:45.565 --> 33:48.234
Watched it all happening
on here.

33:48.234 --> 33:50.194
Real toe-tapper.

33:50.194 --> 33:52.739
I assume you made sure
to be invisible

33:52.739 --> 33:54.490
in the carrying out
of your duties?

33:54.490 --> 33:56.534
Have you known me
to be otherwise?

33:56.534 --> 33:58.202
Yes. Almost solely.

33:58.202 --> 34:01.539
So I need to know, Dad,
that you covered your tracks

34:01.539 --> 34:04.500
when you planted the stories
about the natural gas companies

34:04.500 --> 34:08.796
because I put someone good,
and I mean very good, on this.

34:08.796 --> 34:11.299
Of course.
You told me to cover my tracks,

34:11.299 --> 34:12.550
I covered my tracks.

34:12.550 --> 34:15.219
They will arrive at me

34:15.219 --> 34:18.389
after they find the...
the grassy knoll gunman

34:18.389 --> 34:21.059
and who killed Jimmy Hoffa.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.061
Good. Real good.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.730
Fantastic.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.398
- I should get back to it.
- Chuck.

34:29.358 --> 34:31.611
You did great.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.364
You marshaled all resources.

34:35.364 --> 34:37.742
You partnered with a man

34:37.742 --> 34:40.203
you'd tangled with
for almost a decade.

34:40.203 --> 34:42.872
You set that aside to take out
a bigger threat.

34:42.872 --> 34:46.084
That's advanced.
That's elevated.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.877
That's the kind of thing
that gives me comfort

34:47.877 --> 34:49.587
for what happens after I'm gone.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.758
Let's hope that's
a long time from now.

34:53.758 --> 34:55.093
It'll be when it'll be.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.511
The point is...

34:58.304 --> 35:00.598
I now know
that you'll be fine.

35:02.433 --> 35:05.269
You've learned all the lessons
I have to teach and then some.

35:06.562 --> 35:08.272
It's all inside you.

35:09.816 --> 35:11.400
You know, Pop,
I've long held

35:11.400 --> 35:16.280
that the two heaviest letters
in the alphabet

35:16.280 --> 35:18.282
were J and R.

35:18.282 --> 35:22.620
But now, after what we've been
through together in this last,

35:22.620 --> 35:24.956
they've started to feel
just right.

35:36.676 --> 35:39.303
Now that you're... you're wearing
the Junior mantle easier...

35:39.303 --> 35:41.139
Mm.

35:41.139 --> 35:45.476
...maybe stop slumping about
the shoulders when you walk.

35:45.476 --> 35:49.897
Have some personal pride in
your gait, for Christ's sakes.

35:49.897 --> 35:52.066
You're still a Rhoades.

36:06.247 --> 36:08.624
Found these guys
on the way in.

36:08.624 --> 36:12.670
We got the text inviting us
to come see something special?

36:12.670 --> 36:13.921
What...

36:13.921 --> 36:15.214
um...

36:16.674 --> 36:18.176
What happened here?

36:25.349 --> 36:29.770
Mike, hear this
in the manner I mean it.

36:29.770 --> 36:31.147
Not as a dig,

36:31.147 --> 36:33.316
or to rub your face
in the situation.

36:33.316 --> 36:35.443
Not about that at all.

36:35.443 --> 36:37.445
But...

36:37.445 --> 36:39.697
I'd like to assume the lease
to this place.

36:39.697 --> 36:41.157
Take it off your hands.

36:41.157 --> 36:43.451
Uh-huh. Of course you do.

36:47.830 --> 36:49.498
So this is it.

36:49.498 --> 36:52.126
Hey, man, endings are tough.

36:52.126 --> 36:54.295
Someone always ends up unsatisfied.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.215
Truer thing never said.

36:58.966 --> 37:02.470
I don't mind admitting
I'm a bit rattled right now.

37:02.470 --> 37:04.430
Standing eight count.
I'll get my wind back.

37:06.015 --> 37:09.101
You have to know I'm going
to sue the lot of you

37:09.101 --> 37:11.562
and see to it that criminal
charges are brought.

37:11.562 --> 37:13.147
I think you're gonna find
a road to that

37:13.147 --> 37:15.900
that's very steep
and slippery.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.443
And expensive,

37:17.443 --> 37:19.695
which may present
some difficulty.

37:19.695 --> 37:21.739
But if you decide to persist,

37:21.739 --> 37:23.824
please refer
all legal action

37:23.824 --> 37:27.078
to Orrin Bach here,
my general counsel.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.830
You gonna finally come on
and do this for me, Orrin?

37:29.830 --> 37:32.792
Why not? You'll take up
all my time anyway,

37:32.792 --> 37:36.045
but... I'm delighted
to make it official.

37:37.630 --> 37:40.925
So, yeah, Mike, this is
what it's like to lose.

37:43.135 --> 37:44.428
I bet that felt good.

37:44.428 --> 37:46.597
That one did, yeah.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.600
I read all about your deposits

37:49.600 --> 37:52.436
in those black-owned banks
through Killer Mike.

37:52.436 --> 37:54.272
You've still got
about a hundred million

37:54.272 --> 37:55.940
in those accounts,
don't you?

37:55.940 --> 37:57.191
Just about, yeah.

37:57.191 --> 37:58.859
Well, in Indiana,

37:58.859 --> 38:00.861
that's like being
a billionaire.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.574
That's right.

38:05.574 --> 38:07.285
Yes, it is.

38:09.996 --> 38:12.206
You know what?

38:12.206 --> 38:14.125
Maybe I should be thanking
all you bastards

38:14.125 --> 38:17.128
for giving me a chance
to go out and do it all again.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.587
Spin it up.

38:18.587 --> 38:20.506
You're welcome, then.

38:20.506 --> 38:24.510
Did wonders for me when you
put me in that very position.

38:40.192 --> 38:42.361
This country's built
on second acts.

38:46.824 --> 38:48.617
And when you see mine,

38:48.617 --> 38:51.329
you'd better duck
and fucking cover.

39:17.229 --> 39:20.191
I'm surprised to see so many
long faces in here right now.

39:21.317 --> 39:23.444
Ain't you glad I'm back?

39:23.444 --> 39:25.404
Uh, well, we would be,

39:25.404 --> 39:27.907
but there's the little matter
of the fact that all our money

39:27.907 --> 39:30.659
got fucking wiped out
with Prince's!

39:30.659 --> 39:32.495
Oh, is that the thing?

39:36.290 --> 39:37.917
Did it?

39:37.917 --> 39:39.543
What's on your mind, commander?

39:39.543 --> 39:41.379
You know I've had a hard time

39:41.379 --> 39:43.047
warming up to the plan.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.841
Siphoning the coffers
of an enemy to near empty?

39:45.841 --> 39:47.927
I wouldn't imagine that would
cause you such problems.

39:47.927 --> 39:49.970
No, Chuck,
as much as I like the idea

39:49.970 --> 39:51.389
of Mike Prince going broke--

39:51.389 --> 39:53.182
And believe me, I do--

39:53.182 --> 39:56.477
I can't help but feeling
this is your guitar solo.

39:56.477 --> 39:59.563
Now I'm fine guesting
in a two-guitar band.

39:59.563 --> 40:01.315
A supergroup,
if you think about it.

40:01.315 --> 40:03.192
Wow, you really are good
at this, the ass-kissing.

40:03.192 --> 40:05.194
Hey, it's heartfelt.

40:05.194 --> 40:08.364
Okay, I know
what's missing for me,

40:08.364 --> 40:10.491
and I'm ready to lay down
my overdub now.

40:10.491 --> 40:13.411
It's not enough
to just break him.

40:13.411 --> 40:17.164
We gotta get everyone else
rich in the process.

40:17.164 --> 40:19.250
Really rich. Wealthy, even.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.752
Well, that ups the degree
of difficulty, doesn't it?

40:21.752 --> 40:25.089
Takes it from a straight bet to
a daily double with an exacta.

40:25.089 --> 40:26.632
That's why the payout's
so good.

40:26.632 --> 40:29.093
But how? If we crash the fund,
it all goes.

40:29.093 --> 40:30.803
Doesn't have to.

40:30.803 --> 40:33.431
We have a little thang
that's been laying fallow

40:33.431 --> 40:36.058
inside the structure
of the company for a while now

40:36.058 --> 40:38.394
known as the Admirals Fund.

40:38.394 --> 40:40.438
- Tell 'em, Wags.
- Little side pocket we had

40:40.438 --> 40:42.940
so the brass could enjoy
the spoils of the best ideas.

40:42.940 --> 40:47.319
Cherry-picking trades
for a secret internal fund.

40:47.319 --> 40:50.281
That could look very bad.

40:50.281 --> 40:51.490
Fraudulent, even.

40:51.490 --> 40:53.325
In a certain light, maybe.

40:53.325 --> 40:56.787
But, as I say, it's dormant.

40:56.787 --> 40:58.956
Yeah, Chuck, we're well
past that, aren't we?

40:58.956 --> 41:00.958
Bloodhound can't help
blood-hounding.

41:01.959 --> 41:03.377
But he's all bark now,

41:03.377 --> 41:05.129
and I suppose we all need
our motivators.

41:05.129 --> 41:06.464
Carry on.

41:08.007 --> 41:10.384
We're gonna siphon
the employee money

41:10.384 --> 41:11.969
into the Admirals Fund,

41:11.969 --> 41:14.430
and when the basket of stocks
hits rock-bottom,

41:14.430 --> 41:16.474
we're gonna buy them.

41:17.766 --> 41:20.478
So that's where we are now.

41:20.478 --> 41:23.397
If wiping out Prince
was my masterpiece,

41:23.397 --> 41:27.318
putting the Admirals Fund
with all your money in

41:27.318 --> 41:30.321
on the other side so we could
take him out at the lows,

41:30.321 --> 41:32.781
that is my magnum opus.

41:36.076 --> 41:38.662
<i>I've rarely seen a rocket ride
like this one.</i>

41:38.662 --> 41:40.956
<i>There's nothing like government</i>

41:40.956 --> 41:42.374
<i>clearing these companies,</i>

41:42.374 --> 41:43.834
<i>giving them a clean bill
of health,</i>

41:43.834 --> 41:45.044
<i>to send these stocks soaring</i>

41:45.044 --> 41:46.504
<i>right to the close.</i>

41:46.504 --> 41:48.839
So that's what
you're here to see, Ben.

41:48.839 --> 41:50.466
Tuk.

41:50.466 --> 41:52.510
All of you.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.678
Our shit didn't go down
the tubes.

41:54.678 --> 41:58.015
Yeah. Even though you were too
fucking mercenary to join me,

41:58.015 --> 41:59.183
I let it happen.

42:00.476 --> 42:02.853
We're in the Admirals Fund?

42:07.358 --> 42:08.859
We're in the fucking
Admirals Fund?

42:08.859 --> 42:10.194
We're in
the fucking Admirals Fund!

42:10.194 --> 42:12.279
- Oh, shit!
- Fuck, yeah!

42:12.279 --> 42:16.534
We're in the Admirals Fund!

42:16.534 --> 42:18.536
Ah!

42:18.536 --> 42:21.205
Uh... am I?

42:23.415 --> 42:26.043
Because, you know, I-I had
your backs the whole time.

42:26.043 --> 42:28.837
What the fuck happened to you?

42:28.837 --> 42:31.382
Spyros, you ran all the way
to Camp David

42:31.382 --> 42:33.384
to try and warn Prince,
didn't you?

42:33.384 --> 42:35.135
The Marine Guards
wouldn't let me in.

42:36.595 --> 42:38.556
They're not a good group
to get pushy with.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.558
We included you anyway.

42:40.558 --> 42:42.726
I must be getting soft
in my old age.

42:42.726 --> 42:44.895
So I'm not broke?

42:44.895 --> 42:47.064
- I'm actually...
- Yeah. Rich.

42:47.064 --> 42:48.732
Very fucking rich.

42:52.111 --> 42:53.404
All of you lucky bastards

42:53.404 --> 42:55.906
are up 3X today and rising,

42:55.906 --> 42:57.408
thanks to Bobby Axelrod.

43:06.125 --> 43:08.460
In case any of you
are wondering,

43:08.460 --> 43:11.922
you are now standing in the new
headquarters of Axe Global!

43:13.424 --> 43:16.176
And I am looking
for intrepid souls

43:16.176 --> 43:18.387
who are willing to go out
every day

43:18.387 --> 43:22.600
and kill for me in an epic quest
for fucking alpha.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.269
So, who among you

43:25.269 --> 43:28.731
is ready to join me
in my new assault on wealth?

43:28.731 --> 43:29.940
Who's with me?

43:31.609 --> 43:33.444
Yeah!

43:36.780 --> 43:39.074
Yeah! Yeah!

43:39.074 --> 43:41.869
Yeah! Come on!

43:54.548 --> 43:58.135
I heard those hyenas
cheering down there.

43:58.135 --> 44:00.846
I assume Axelrod threw them
some fresh meat.

44:00.846 --> 44:02.514
More or less.

44:02.514 --> 44:04.433
I also assume
you're staying.

44:05.934 --> 44:07.770
Perfect.

44:07.770 --> 44:09.313
I warned you once,
back then,

44:09.313 --> 44:11.440
that things would get dirty
and dangerous.

44:11.440 --> 44:13.567
You more than embraced that,
though, didn't you?

44:13.567 --> 44:15.653
Joining up with that
backstabbing marauder

44:15.653 --> 44:16.987
is the perfect post for you.

44:16.987 --> 44:18.405
It's a wonder
you didn't warn me

44:18.405 --> 44:19.490
what kind of animal
you'd become.

44:19.490 --> 44:20.908
Let me stop you there,

44:20.908 --> 44:22.159
before you really
say some stuff

44:22.159 --> 44:23.494
we're both gonna regret

44:23.494 --> 44:25.162
at the next holiday
get-together.

44:25.162 --> 44:27.581
The holidays?
You have got to be kidding me.

44:27.581 --> 44:29.500
Hey, you're still my uncle. Family.

44:29.500 --> 44:33.003
So, you didn't
take the ride with us.

44:33.003 --> 44:34.838
That wasn't something
I could swing.

44:34.838 --> 44:37.007
But I couldn't let you take
the fall with Prince either.

44:37.966 --> 44:39.927
You're still a rich man.

44:47.351 --> 44:49.353
That is your account.

44:50.938 --> 44:52.356
Kept it sidelined.

44:52.356 --> 44:54.983
Totally
out of the action today.

44:54.983 --> 44:56.985
You're still at about
a hundred mill.

44:56.985 --> 44:59.071
Like Prince ended up.

44:59.071 --> 45:00.739
There's something poetic
in that.

45:03.075 --> 45:07.037
I have gone from a rich man,
to a pauper,

45:07.037 --> 45:11.250
back to a rich man
in the course of a single day.

45:11.250 --> 45:14.086
And it has made me realize
what I need to do with my life.

45:15.587 --> 45:17.589
Pick up that baton for real.

45:19.258 --> 45:20.759
My own.

45:20.759 --> 45:23.220
One that belongs to me,
not some legend's.

45:24.388 --> 45:25.973
Find myself on the stage

45:25.973 --> 45:28.058
and in front of an orchestra.

45:28.058 --> 45:29.893
You'll do it, maestro.

45:29.893 --> 45:31.645
I know you will.

45:49.455 --> 45:50.998
Impressive work, man.

45:50.998 --> 45:52.708
Well, you played
an integral part in it.

45:52.708 --> 45:54.251
No way it all happens
without--

45:54.251 --> 45:55.919
No, I just mean climbing up
on that desk.

45:55.919 --> 45:57.880
- Oh.
- Impressive.

45:57.880 --> 46:00.716
Christ, I'd need some Doan's
for the back if I even tried.

46:00.716 --> 46:02.217
Don't fool yourself.

46:02.217 --> 46:04.511
I'm not the same guy
I was when we first met.

46:04.511 --> 46:06.972
I was worried I was gonna roll
my ankle on the dismount.

46:06.972 --> 46:08.640
Yeah. Sure.

46:10.809 --> 46:12.811
You're not
the same guy, either.

46:12.811 --> 46:14.980
- Didn't like that version.
- Hmm.

46:14.980 --> 46:16.732
But the fella standing
in front of me...

46:16.732 --> 46:18.525
Yeah, I know it.

46:18.525 --> 46:22.112
Something about going
through the wars with someone.

46:22.112 --> 46:25.407
Yeah, you learn a lot facing
a man, battling against him.

46:25.407 --> 46:26.825
But when you throw in together...

46:26.825 --> 46:28.577
Absolutely.

46:28.577 --> 46:31.663
Yeah, like Clapton and Winwood
in Blind Faith.

46:32.664 --> 46:34.124
Problem is,

46:34.124 --> 46:36.627
that kind of talent
in one group

46:36.627 --> 46:38.962
can only ever last one album.

46:38.962 --> 46:40.547
Well, I think
the heroin and blow

46:40.547 --> 46:41.965
had more to do
with that breakup,

46:41.965 --> 46:43.759
but I get your point.

46:43.759 --> 46:45.636
At least they got
that one great moment on tape,

46:45.636 --> 46:48.639
together in the studio,
before it blew apart.

46:48.639 --> 46:50.224
Everything does.

46:50.224 --> 46:52.100
Eventually.

46:52.100 --> 46:54.311
Things end.

46:54.311 --> 46:57.231
As our time
working together has to.

46:59.024 --> 47:02.820
I'm going back
to doing what I do, so...

47:04.530 --> 47:06.907
you'd best run this place right.

47:06.907 --> 47:10.577
I once told you
what a badge does to a man.

47:10.577 --> 47:13.038
And as in almost everything,

47:13.038 --> 47:15.624
you were right, Robby.

47:18.085 --> 47:20.379
To that end, Carlos.

47:20.379 --> 47:22.506
And Wags is really gonna hate
that I'm doing this,

47:22.506 --> 47:27.094
but I must have got caught up
in the spirit of togetherness.

47:28.762 --> 47:30.222
Here.

47:34.518 --> 47:36.687
You're hoping this buys you
some indulgences.

47:36.687 --> 47:38.438
Damn straight I am.

47:41.149 --> 47:42.568
Thanks, Axe.

47:44.152 --> 47:45.404
For all of it.

47:46.572 --> 47:47.781
My pleasure.

47:47.781 --> 47:50.284
And to you too, Chuck.

47:50.284 --> 47:53.287
<i>I've been waiting so long</i>

47:54.413 --> 47:56.039
<i>Somebody holds the key</i>

47:58.208 --> 48:01.545
<i>Well, I'm near the end</i>

48:01.545 --> 48:05.674
<i>And I just ain't got
The time</i>

48:07.759 --> 48:09.344
I thought it'd convince you,

48:09.344 --> 48:12.472
that all this today
would be a good pitch.

48:12.472 --> 48:14.099
But you're leaving
for good, aren't you?

48:14.099 --> 48:16.727
Yep. Just like you're staying.

48:16.727 --> 48:18.520
Yeah, I am.

48:18.520 --> 48:20.856
It's where I'm meant to be.

48:22.649 --> 48:23.901
You sure?

48:25.944 --> 48:28.155
'Cause we could do
great things if you stayed.

48:28.155 --> 48:30.908
Great and vicious things.

48:30.908 --> 48:32.284
I know.

48:32.284 --> 48:33.994
Exactly why I'm leaving.

48:33.994 --> 48:36.246
It's time for me
to be done with that.

48:37.998 --> 48:40.250
My other office
is now available.

48:40.250 --> 48:42.169
Be a great place to run
a philanthropy out of.

48:42.169 --> 48:43.420
It's yours if you want it.

48:44.630 --> 48:45.923
Final act of charity

48:45.923 --> 48:47.883
I'll be doing today.

48:49.092 --> 48:50.844
<i>You are the reason</i>

48:50.844 --> 48:54.848
<i>I've been waiting
All these years</i>

48:54.848 --> 48:58.268
<i>Somebody holds the key</i>

48:58.268 --> 49:01.813
<i>But I'm near the end</i>

49:01.813 --> 49:06.777
<i>And I just ain't got
The time</i>

49:06.777 --> 49:08.904
<i>Oh, oh, oh,
and I'm wasted</i>

49:08.904 --> 49:10.656
I bet you think
I want to rub it in.

49:10.656 --> 49:13.325
I actually
think better of you.

49:13.325 --> 49:15.494
You once offered me the chance,
if I were feeling down,

49:15.494 --> 49:17.371
to come share
some Scotch with you.

49:17.371 --> 49:20.582
I want you to know,
I hope you do the same.

49:22.209 --> 49:24.503
You made me
better at what I do.

49:24.503 --> 49:26.713
In every way.

49:26.713 --> 49:29.007
Are you saying
that's why you bested us?

49:29.007 --> 49:31.259
No. I was kick-ass
at that stuff.

49:32.469 --> 49:33.971
I mean as a human

49:33.971 --> 49:35.931
and second in command.

49:37.391 --> 49:38.767
You're the tops I've seen.

49:40.602 --> 49:42.521
And yet.

49:42.521 --> 49:45.399
It's because you're
a good person you lost.

49:45.399 --> 49:47.442
Not Prince. You.

49:47.442 --> 49:49.569
Oddly,
of little consolation.

49:49.569 --> 49:51.655
But you will come
for that drink?

49:52.781 --> 49:54.741
I think I actually might.

49:54.741 --> 49:56.243
Yes.

50:03.625 --> 50:08.505
<i>But I can't find
My way home</i>

50:08.505 --> 50:13.010
<i>No, I can't
Find my way home</i>

50:15.846 --> 50:17.264
Good.

50:17.264 --> 50:19.516
I've been looking forward
to this moment.

50:19.516 --> 50:21.810
An old-fashioned negotiation
for your services

50:21.810 --> 50:24.521
as performance coach
and head of HR.

50:24.521 --> 50:25.981
Or, not to tip my hand,

50:25.981 --> 50:27.816
you looking to expand
your portfolio?

50:31.403 --> 50:32.904
Shit.

50:32.904 --> 50:34.197
You're out too.

50:39.745 --> 50:41.955
I'd really love it
if you stayed, Wend.

50:43.915 --> 50:46.293
I finally made my way back.
This could be like old times.

50:47.377 --> 50:49.046
Part of me would really love to.

50:49.046 --> 50:51.381
But I'm gonna stay at Mental,

50:51.381 --> 50:54.092
that telehealth thing,
and make a go of it.

50:54.092 --> 50:56.053
I'm gonna help a lot of people
from there.

50:57.637 --> 50:59.389
Maybe one day
you'll take me public.

51:01.183 --> 51:03.060
Won't be the same
without you here.

51:03.060 --> 51:04.561
What if I can't do it?

51:04.561 --> 51:06.396
It'll be different,
but you can do it.

51:06.396 --> 51:09.066
And I have the name of someone

51:09.066 --> 51:11.818
who'll be a hell
of a replacement for me too.

51:11.818 --> 51:13.945
And most of the people here
already know Dr. Mayer.

51:17.908 --> 51:20.786
I really didn't want
to say goodbye to you again.

51:24.873 --> 51:26.500
Then don't.

51:26.500 --> 51:29.419
We got through
the shadow of 9/11

51:29.419 --> 51:31.254
and stayed connected.

51:31.254 --> 51:34.549
We got through the arrests,

51:34.549 --> 51:36.259
the rebellions,

51:36.259 --> 51:38.929
the exit,
the rebuilding,

51:38.929 --> 51:41.723
and always
stayed connected.

51:41.723 --> 51:43.266
Where it mattered.

51:43.266 --> 51:45.102
We'll both be
in the same city.

51:45.102 --> 51:47.145
We're the same people.

51:47.145 --> 51:49.189
We'll stay connected now, too.

51:51.108 --> 51:53.860
Just not at this place.

51:55.320 --> 51:56.947
Yeah.

51:56.947 --> 51:59.616
Yeah to all of it.

52:02.244 --> 52:04.412
Thank you, Bobby.

52:05.497 --> 52:06.790
Thank you.

52:08.416 --> 52:09.626
For everything.

52:27.185 --> 52:29.271
<i>I feel a change
In the weather</i>

52:29.271 --> 52:30.981
<i>I feel a change in me</i>

52:30.981 --> 52:32.482
<i>The days
Are getting shorter</i>

52:32.482 --> 52:35.152
<i>And the birds
Begin to leave</i>

52:35.152 --> 52:37.112
<i>Even me, yes, yes, y'all</i>

52:37.112 --> 52:38.989
<i>Who has been so long alone</i>

52:38.989 --> 52:41.283
<i>I'm headed home</i>

52:41.283 --> 52:43.368
<i>Headed home</i>

52:51.209 --> 52:53.003
<i>The nights are getting
Colder now</i>

52:53.003 --> 52:55.046
<i>And the air
Is getting crisp</i>

52:55.046 --> 52:58.842
<i>I first tasted the universe
On a night like this</i>

52:58.842 --> 53:00.719
<i>A box of wine, an alibi</i>

53:00.719 --> 53:03.096
<i>And the hunger in her eyes</i>

53:03.096 --> 53:05.348
<i>In a place where the tree
Of good and evil</i>

53:05.348 --> 53:06.892
<i>Still resides</i>

53:09.811 --> 53:11.521
<i>Still resides</i>

53:13.565 --> 53:15.192
<i>Homecoming</i>

53:17.235 --> 53:19.112
I kind of hoped
you'd be here waiting.

53:19.112 --> 53:20.780
No, not kind of. I...

53:22.574 --> 53:24.034
I hoped you'd be here.

53:25.035 --> 53:26.870
I'm always here.

53:28.330 --> 53:29.956
I know.

53:29.956 --> 53:31.374
You are, too.

53:31.374 --> 53:32.959
Seems to be true.

53:32.959 --> 53:34.711
You know, I wasn't sure
he'd let you leave.

53:34.711 --> 53:36.796
Or you'd be able to resist.

53:36.796 --> 53:38.882
It's time for me
to find my own way.

53:40.050 --> 53:41.384
And it's the only way

53:41.384 --> 53:43.220
that the relationships
can last

53:43.220 --> 53:46.223
with either of you.

53:47.599 --> 53:49.059
That's probably true.

53:52.729 --> 53:54.898
Where are you off to right now?

53:56.566 --> 53:58.568
I hadn't really
thought about it.

53:58.568 --> 54:00.362
I was probably just gonna
head back to the house.

54:00.362 --> 54:02.447
I have the kids tonight.

54:02.447 --> 54:04.908
I was in the mood
for some tempura or something.

54:06.451 --> 54:07.827
You want to make it
a family dinner?

54:07.827 --> 54:10.997
The kids would love that. Absolutely.

54:10.997 --> 54:12.916
And so would I.

54:30.475 --> 54:32.602
Make sure all this shit
gets carefully packed

54:32.602 --> 54:33.853
and sent to him wherever.

54:33.853 --> 54:35.397
I will.

54:35.397 --> 54:37.274
Have the designer get
all that green crap

54:37.274 --> 54:39.943
off the walls downstairs,
and strip out some of this wood.

54:39.943 --> 54:42.654
Let's cool this place off a bit.

54:45.615 --> 54:47.450
Thought about how
you'll redecorate yet?

54:47.450 --> 54:50.328
I've had other things
on my mind, <i>capo di tutti capi.</i>

54:50.328 --> 54:52.497
Well, after a victory
such as this,

54:52.497 --> 54:54.833
things do take a moment
to settle.

54:55.875 --> 54:58.003
- But...
- Yeah.

54:58.003 --> 54:59.421
You don't have to say it.

54:59.421 --> 55:00.839
I will be here with you

55:00.839 --> 55:03.300
to get this place
cranking again.

55:03.300 --> 55:05.343
- But then...
- What?

55:05.343 --> 55:06.803
Miami?

55:06.803 --> 55:08.388
With all those
other rich fucks?

55:08.388 --> 55:11.141
You know, it does have
a lot to recommend it.

55:11.141 --> 55:13.310
It is the center of it all
right now.

55:13.310 --> 55:15.353
Maybe we take a trip
down together.

55:15.353 --> 55:17.856
But first, bring 'em in.

55:19.316 --> 55:20.650
<i>Hoo-hoo</i>

55:24.112 --> 55:25.822
<i>This here's a story</i>

55:25.822 --> 55:28.491
<i>About Billy Joe
And Bobbie Sue</i>

55:28.491 --> 55:33.538
<i>Two young lovers
With nothing better to do</i>

55:34.539 --> 55:36.333
<i>Than sit around the house</i>

55:36.333 --> 55:37.959
<i>Get high
And watch the tube</i>

55:37.959 --> 55:39.919
What are our instructions?

55:39.919 --> 55:41.671
Yeah, Axe, what do you
want us to do?

55:41.671 --> 55:43.256
Do?

55:43.256 --> 55:45.633
What do you think
I want you to do?

55:45.633 --> 55:47.594
<i>They headed down
To, ooh, old El Paso</i>

55:51.056 --> 55:53.266
Let's make some fucking money.

55:53.266 --> 55:55.018
All right!
All right, yeah!

55:56.686 --> 55:59.022
- Fuck, yeah!
- Let's go.

55:59.022 --> 56:02.692
<i>Bobbie Sue took the money
And run</i>

56:04.277 --> 56:06.404
<i>Go on,
Take the money and run</i>

56:08.698 --> 56:11.659
<i>Go on,
Take the money and run</i>

56:11.659 --> 56:13.787
<i>Hoo-hoo-hoo</i>

56:13.787 --> 56:16.081
<i>Go on,
Take the money and run</i>

56:18.500 --> 56:21.419
<i>Go on,
Take the money and run</i>

56:21.419 --> 56:23.421
<i>Hoo-hoo-hoo</i>

56:23.421 --> 56:27.592
<i>Billy Mack is a detective
Down in Texas</i>

56:29.010 --> 56:30.553
Whoa!

56:32.931 --> 56:37.644
<i>He ain't gonna let those two
Escape justice</i>

56:37.644 --> 56:39.145
<i>He makes his living</i>

56:39.145 --> 56:41.356
<i>Off of the people's taxes</i>

56:42.565 --> 56:44.567
<i>Bobbie Sue, whoa</i>

56:44.567 --> 56:47.070
<i>She slipped away</i>

56:47.070 --> 56:51.741
<i>Billy Joe caught up to her
The very next day</i>

56:51.741 --> 56:55.328
<i>They got the money
Hey, you know they got away</i>

56:56.704 --> 56:58.373
<i>They headed down south</i>

56:58.373 --> 57:00.875
<i>And they're still
Running today</i>

57:00.875 --> 57:04.546
<i>Singing go on,
Take the money and run</i>

57:07.006 --> 57:10.218
<i>Go on,
Take the money and run</i>

57:10.218 --> 57:11.845
<i>Hoo-hoo-hoo</i>

57:11.845 --> 57:14.597
<i>Go on,
Take the money and run</i>

<i>Ooh, Lord</i>

57:16.266 --> 57:19.394
<i>Go on,
Take the money and run</i>

57:19.394 --> 57:21.563
<i>Hoo-hoo-hoo</i>

57:38.788 --> 57:40.457
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

57:40.457 --> 57:42.792
<i>Go on,
Take the money and run</i>

57:42.792 --> 57:43.960
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

57:43.960 --> 57:45.545
<i>Hoo-hoo-hoo</i>

57:45.545 --> 57:48.089
<i>Go on,

57:52.385 --> 57:53.636
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

57:53.636 --> 57:55.221
<i>Hoo-hoo-hoo</i>
