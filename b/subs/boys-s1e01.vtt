Yo, I am so psyched
for Invisible Force 2.

00:32.908 --> 00:35.578
Please.
Invisible Force 1 was lame.

00:35.661 --> 00:37.246
I'm all about Rising Tide.

00:37.288 --> 00:39.582
Rising Tide? The Deep?

00:39.623 --> 00:41.459
-Uh-huh.
-Translucent could kick
the Deep's ass.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.127
(scoffs) How? He's invisible.

00:43.169 --> 00:44.754
That's, like, all he's got.
That's it.

00:44.795 --> 00:47.006
Exactly.
He sneaks up on the Deep,

00:47.047 --> 00:48.758
and then boom, motherfucker!

00:48.799 --> 00:50.426
-Sit down.
-Until the Deep makes a shark

00:50.468 --> 00:52.344
bite Translucent's dick off.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.346
How's he gonna find his dick?
It's invisible.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.640

01:20.539 --> 01:21.540
Get up. Get up, get up, get up.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.417
Come on, Benjy.
Come on, come on.

(indistinct chatter)

Stay back.

01:55.366 --> 01:56.867
Just stay the fuck back.

01:58.536 --> 02:00.538
What are you smiling at?

You boys okay?

02:27.022 --> 02:29.984
Can I... can I get a selfie?

02:30.025 --> 02:32.403
Course you can.

The Seven's Queen Maeve

02:36.407 --> 02:38.075
made another heroic save today,

02:38.158 --> 02:39.577
stopping
a hijacked armored truck

02:39.618 --> 02:40.953
on the streets of Brooklyn,

02:40.995 --> 02:42.454
then staying behind
for a photo op

02:42.496 --> 02:43.914
-with some very lucky fans.
-Nice to meet you.

-Thanks, Jennifer. And now...

02:45.583 --> 02:47.167
HUGHIE:
So, this is pretty much

02:47.209 --> 02:50.045
everything in one.
Bluetooth speakers.

02:50.087 --> 02:51.672
It's in stereo,
so you can put it

02:51.714 --> 02:53.257
all around your living room,
have some fun with it.

02:53.299 --> 02:55.175
You said you have
a standard cable box, right?

02:55.217 --> 02:57.928
-Uh-huh.
-Okay, then I need to get you
an audio transmitter,

02:57.970 --> 02:59.430
aptX Low Latency.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.098
It makes it
so there's less audio lag,

03:01.140 --> 03:02.850
and it's got
a standard optical in.

03:02.892 --> 03:05.603
And let's hook you up
with thousand-meg HDMI.

03:05.644 --> 03:06.729
Let's go with this one.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.314
Uh, it costs a little bit more,

03:08.355 --> 03:10.065
but the carbon's
way more conductive.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.109
(indistinct chatter over TV)

03:23.329 --> 03:25.748
Hey, Gary. Um...

03:25.789 --> 03:27.750
-I really need to talk to you
about something.
-Later, kid.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.627
Okay. Cool.

03:29.668 --> 03:32.796
Later-- you want, like...
want, like, 30-30 minutes?

03:32.838 --> 03:34.256
Like, a solid 45?

03:37.801 --> 03:40.012
Excuse me, sir?

03:40.054 --> 03:42.473
Hi. I'd like
to make an appointment

03:42.514 --> 03:44.516
for you to come over and...

03:44.558 --> 03:47.353
lay some cable.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.189
Okay. Uh... oh, Robin.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.857
Oh, dear, dear, Robin.

03:51.899 --> 03:55.110
Um, that doesn't mean
what you think it means.

03:55.152 --> 03:58.030
Um, "laying cable" means sex.

03:58.072 --> 03:59.949
No, "laying pipe" means sex.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.325
"Laying cable" means

04:01.367 --> 04:03.077
you want me
to come over to your house

04:03.118 --> 04:04.745
-and just take a big, old shit.
-(chuckles)

04:04.787 --> 04:06.830
-That's disgusting.
-Well, okay.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.248
But you...
Who-who said it, though?

04:08.290 --> 04:10.793
Okay. Are you ready?
Despite your best efforts,

04:10.834 --> 04:12.878
I'm actually still hungry.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.214
-I'm actually more hungry now.
-(laughs)

04:15.255 --> 04:18.676
-Where are we gonna go
after all this hot talk?
-I don't know.

04:18.717 --> 04:20.094
-You know?
-More importantly,
where are we gonna go

04:20.135 --> 04:21.845
-to lay some cable afterwards?
-(laughs)

04:21.887 --> 04:23.180
Geez.

04:23.222 --> 04:24.848
So, did you ask him?

04:24.890 --> 04:27.393
-Who?
-Gary.

04:27.434 --> 04:30.604
Did you ask Gary for the raise?

04:30.646 --> 04:32.648
Yeah. Yeah. It was-- it was a...

04:32.690 --> 04:35.067
Look, it was a crazy day,
and-and he was super busy,

04:35.109 --> 04:37.778
but tomorrow for sure. Yes.

04:37.820 --> 04:39.780
Okay.

04:39.822 --> 04:42.366
What was I supposed to do,
kick his door down?

04:42.408 --> 04:44.368
Like Homelander?

04:44.410 --> 04:45.744
I said "okay."

04:45.786 --> 04:47.329
Yeah, but you didn't mean it.

04:47.371 --> 04:48.956
Hey, I see the look.

04:48.998 --> 04:50.874
I see it. Come on.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.130
This is like when
we started dating.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.590
I don't think that's...
I don't think that's true.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.010
Dude, I had to ask you out.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.429
Well, excuse me for waiting.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.305
You ever hear of chivalry?

05:05.347 --> 05:08.267
Listen, this is about you
getting what you deserve.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.977
I'm killing myself at school

05:10.019 --> 05:13.188
because I think it's gonna be
worth it for both of us.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.983
You know,
if we move in together.

05:16.025 --> 05:17.985
Wait, what? What?
W-W-Wait. Hey, hey, hey.

05:18.027 --> 05:19.278
Hey, hey. What was that?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.238
What'd you just say?

05:21.280 --> 05:24.074
Well, I mean, we can't keep,
you know, laying pipe

05:24.074 --> 05:25.826
at your dad's place.

05:25.868 --> 05:27.494
Trying to be all quiet.

05:27.536 --> 05:30.330

Billy Joel post...

05:35.794 --> 05:38.797

07:59.521 --> 08:02.816
I was born Super-Abled.

08:02.858 --> 08:05.194
Uh, my mom was thrilled.

08:05.235 --> 08:09.114
She took me to all
the little miss hero pageants,

08:09.156 --> 08:10.741
but I hated it.

08:10.782 --> 08:13.160
Ugh, I mean, I can still...

08:13.202 --> 08:15.787
smell the hairspray.

08:15.829 --> 08:19.124
Uh, but... (clears throat)

08:19.166 --> 08:23.629
...at the Q and A, they always
asked me what my wish was,

08:23.670 --> 08:27.966
and I always said,
"to save the world."

08:28.008 --> 08:30.886
And the judges just chuckled

08:30.928 --> 08:33.222
like it was cute.

08:33.263 --> 08:37.267
But it wasn't a joke to me.

08:39.144 --> 08:43.273
Since when
did "hopeful" and "naive"

08:43.315 --> 08:45.609
become the same thing?

08:45.651 --> 08:48.403
I mean, why would you
get into this business

08:48.445 --> 08:51.365
if not to save the world?

how many people came?

09:23.230 --> 09:25.232
Wow.

09:26.441 --> 09:28.277

Lot of love in the room.

09:30.821 --> 09:33.448

Just really nice.

Aw, geez.
Maybe there's a movie on.

-No, keep it.
-No, we can switch it.

09:50.966 --> 09:53.719
I was chasing
these bank robbers.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.346
She just stepped
in the middle of the street,

09:58.557 --> 09:59.975
Middle of the...

off the fucking curb.

Everyone at Vought is just...

10:16.408 --> 10:19.578

Now, you two weren't married,
and look,

10:23.665 --> 10:26.418
technically,
there's no legal claim.

10:26.460 --> 10:27.711
But...

10:27.753 --> 10:30.255
Vought wants to do
the right thing:

10:30.297 --> 10:33.633
offer you $45,000
in restitution.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.012
All you have to do is sign

10:37.054 --> 10:38.221
right here,

10:38.263 --> 10:40.265
and I'll offer you the check.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.270
This is
a confidentiality agreement.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.147
It's a boilerplate NDA.

10:47.189 --> 10:50.150
I sign this, and...

10:50.192 --> 10:52.944
I can't talk about it?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.946
Have to pretend
like it didn't happen,

10:54.988 --> 10:58.116
like I wasn't holding
Robin's arms in my hands?

10:58.158 --> 11:00.077
Look, I know you're upset,

11:00.118 --> 11:02.079
but we're just trying to help.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.581
Then say you're sorry.

11:04.623 --> 11:06.041
Excuse me?

11:06.083 --> 11:08.710
I mean, you people say
"our condolences"

11:08.752 --> 11:10.754
and "my sympathies"
and "our regrets,"

11:10.796 --> 11:12.798
but nobody can look me
in the fucking eye

11:12.839 --> 11:15.634
and say "I'm sorry."

11:15.675 --> 11:18.929
I'm not signing anything.
Get out.

11:18.970 --> 11:22.682
I said get the hell out!

11:27.646 --> 11:29.648
You okay?

11:31.525 --> 11:35.737
As I said,
boilerplate NDA, really.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.739
Pretty standard stuff.

11:37.781 --> 11:40.409
Can I think about it?

11:42.911 --> 11:45.664
If you have
any questions at all,

11:45.705 --> 11:47.499

right now.

Oh, Annie.

12:14.943 --> 12:16.862
I'm hungry.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.864
Don't worry.
I didn't get the job.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.199
You don't know that.

12:21.241 --> 12:24.202
They're auditioning girls

It's them.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.014
It's them.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.265
Hello?

12:46.266 --> 12:48.268
Yes, this is she.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.814
I got it?

12:52.856 --> 12:54.357
-You got it!
-(screams)

12:54.399 --> 12:55.400
You got it!

12:55.442 --> 12:57.319
Shh.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.030
(whispering):
Oh, my God.

13:00.071 --> 13:01.656
Uh, I'm so... I'm so sorry.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.617
It's a weird connection.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.118
I don't know what that was,
actually.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.329
Uh... Mm-hmm.

13:07.370 --> 13:10.123
HUGHIE:
Oh, shit.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.333
MAN:
Yeah?

13:11.374 --> 13:13.001
MAN 2:
I think she was an addict.

13:13.043 --> 13:14.377
MAN:
Needle tracks?

13:14.419 --> 13:16.713
MAN 2:
12 marks on one arm.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.381
MAN:
More dope coming in.

13:19.382 --> 13:20.509
More pushers at work.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.260
What you doing?

13:22.302 --> 13:23.720
Can't file a criminal case

13:23.762 --> 13:25.096
against A-Train.
Supes are like cops.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.640
They can't be charged

13:26.681 --> 13:28.642
-for damages
while they're on the job.
-Okay.

13:28.683 --> 13:30.393
But maybe we can file
a wrongful death.

13:30.435 --> 13:33.355
I just got to get Robin's
parents to sign off on it.

13:33.396 --> 13:36.399
-Hughie, come sit with me.
-Dad, I'm not...

13:36.441 --> 13:38.527
-I'm right...
-(pats couch)

13:38.568 --> 13:40.570
Okay.

13:46.952 --> 13:48.995
Good for you.

13:49.037 --> 13:52.040
You want to make this right,
what happened to Robin.

13:54.543 --> 13:56.211
But you can't.

13:57.254 --> 13:58.713
So sign this.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.676
What?

14:02.717 --> 14:04.636
This is a lot of money, Hughie.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.680
We could really use it.

14:08.682 --> 14:11.101
I can't-- Dad, they killed her.

14:11.142 --> 14:12.811
Be realistic, okay?

14:12.852 --> 14:14.354
Even if we could pay
for a lawyer--

14:14.396 --> 14:16.690
and that's a big if--
there's no case.

14:16.731 --> 14:18.108
She was in the street.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.735
-Be like if a bus hit her.
-Dad, she was one step

14:20.777 --> 14:21.945
-off the curb.
-I...

14:21.987 --> 14:23.446
-I saw it!
-Hughie, look. Look.

14:23.488 --> 14:26.491
-You can't do this.
-Why not?

14:26.533 --> 14:28.118
-Dad, I have...
-You don't have the fight.

14:28.159 --> 14:30.161
You never have.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.709
I'm sorry, but it's-it's true.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.754
Neither do I.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.841
Now...

14:42.882 --> 14:45.677
come and...
come and sit with me, okay?

14:45.719 --> 14:49.180
Remington Steele's on.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.683
-Hughie! Where you going?
-(door opens)

14:51.725 --> 14:53.518
(door closes)

14:53.560 --> 14:55.562
(sighs)

14:58.523 --> 15:01.276
TV REPORTER:
...the red carpet outside
of Vought headquarters,

15:01.318 --> 15:03.361
here for the annual
shareholders presentation...

15:03.403 --> 15:05.864
(fans talking indistinctly,
shouting)

15:05.905 --> 15:07.157
ASHLEY:
There she is.

15:07.198 --> 15:08.867
-Welcome to New York.
-(fans cheering)

15:08.908 --> 15:10.994
I'm Ashley Barrett,
director of talent relations.

15:11.036 --> 15:13.663
So, uh, are all these people
here for me?

15:13.705 --> 15:15.081
Oh, honey.

15:15.123 --> 15:17.792
(laughs) Who else
would they be here for?

15:17.834 --> 15:19.002
Come on.

15:19.044 --> 15:20.545
We're running late.

15:20.587 --> 15:21.838
Oh, my God.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.716
(fans screaming, cheering)

15:24.758 --> 15:27.344
(camera shutters clicking)

15:28.970 --> 15:31.222
MADELYN:
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:31.264 --> 15:33.516
it is without a doubt
a good time

15:33.558 --> 15:36.770
to be in the Superhero business.

15:36.811 --> 15:39.856
Our net income is up 14%.

15:39.898 --> 15:42.984
Our latest film,
G-Men: World War,

15:43.026 --> 15:45.111
just grossed shy

15:45.153 --> 15:48.698
-of $1.7 billion world-wide.
-(cheers and applause)

15:48.740 --> 15:50.325
And this fall, we break ground

15:50.367 --> 15:52.577
on our newest theme park
outside of Paris.

15:52.619 --> 15:56.039
The branding opportunities
are limitless.

15:56.081 --> 15:58.041
(cheers and applause)

15:58.083 --> 16:01.670
But, you know,
none of that really matters.

16:01.711 --> 16:06.424
Because job one is managing,
supporting,

16:06.466 --> 16:09.803
and advising the brave heroes

16:09.844 --> 16:14.307
who put themselves in
harm's way each and every day

16:14.349 --> 16:16.893
for us.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.562
Let's take a look.

16:25.276 --> 16:27.487
MADELYN (on video):
A world without crime,

16:27.529 --> 16:29.864
with liberty
and justice for all,

16:29.906 --> 16:32.283
that's within our reach,

16:32.325 --> 16:35.578
thanks to the 200-plus
Superheroes

16:35.620 --> 16:37.205
in the Vought Family.

16:37.247 --> 16:39.249
We see a bright future ahead,

16:39.290 --> 16:43.002
where there is a Vought Hero
in every town.

16:43.044 --> 16:46.589
You're doing really well,
by the way, so far.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.717
I-I haven't done anything yet.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.301
Yeah, exactly.
You're already up

16:50.343 --> 16:51.886
two-and-a-half points
with Midwesterners

16:51.928 --> 16:53.972
and conservative Christians
in 18 to 49.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.474
That speech, by the way,
your audition--

16:56.516 --> 16:59.352
(exhales) It was modest;
it was humble.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.980
Really fucking smart choice.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.065
Uh, I-I meant it.

17:04.107 --> 17:06.526
ASHLEY:
Yeah, that's why we love you.

17:06.568 --> 17:09.446
So you ready for your life
to change?

17:09.487 --> 17:11.573
(exhales)

17:11.614 --> 17:13.074
MADELYN (on video):
...including the jewel

17:13.116 --> 17:14.242
in Vought's crown,

17:14.284 --> 17:16.619
the greatest superhero team

17:16.661 --> 17:17.912
the world's ever seen:

17:17.954 --> 17:19.706
The Seven.

17:19.748 --> 17:22.375
That is our job,
our honor.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.002
We are Vought.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.421
We make heroes super.

17:26.463 --> 17:27.881
(cheering, whooping, applause)

17:31.050 --> 17:35.847
I have a very exciting surprise
for you.

17:35.889 --> 17:38.683
Both a member of The Seven,

17:38.725 --> 17:41.686
and Lord of the Seven Seas,

17:41.728 --> 17:44.314
live and in person, the Deep.

17:44.355 --> 17:46.274
(cheering and applause)

17:59.746 --> 18:02.081
DEEP:
Thank you.

18:03.666 --> 18:06.002
Thank you, everybody.

18:06.044 --> 18:09.839
After a long,

18:09.881 --> 18:13.635
distinguished career
with The Seven,

18:13.676 --> 18:18.056
my good friend, the Lamplighter,
has retired.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.266
Let's give him
a big "thank you."

18:20.308 --> 18:21.768
-What do you say?
-(applause)

18:21.810 --> 18:23.186
AUDIENCE MEMBER:
Thank you, Lamplighter!

18:23.228 --> 18:25.188
(cheering and applause)

18:25.230 --> 18:27.732
But now,

18:27.774 --> 18:31.694
as we turn towards the future,

18:31.736 --> 18:35.448
I'd like to introduce someone
very special.

18:35.490 --> 18:38.326
And I, for one, can't wait
to work with her.

18:38.368 --> 18:41.079
Please welcome Starlight.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.914
Go. Go. That's you.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.958
(cheering and applause)

18:53.925 --> 18:55.844
-Ooh, look at that.
-MADELYN: Ladies and gentlemen,

18:55.885 --> 18:58.429
Starlight and the Deep.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.390
-(cheering and applause)

19:00.431 --> 19:02.433
(whooping)

19:04.269 --> 19:05.645
Oh. Hi.

19:05.687 --> 19:07.397
MAN (in audience):
I love you, Starlight!

19:09.440 --> 19:11.150
WOMAN (in audience):
We love you!

19:25.748 --> 19:27.750
(panting)

19:34.424 --> 19:36.426
(breathing heavily)

19:49.606 --> 19:51.858
(breathing heavily)

19:51.900 --> 19:53.985
(echoing):
Hey, buddy, you okay?

19:59.824 --> 20:01.868
Hey, buddy!

20:03.578 --> 20:05.872
(hyperventilating)

20:17.216 --> 20:19.886
Wow.

20:19.928 --> 20:22.388
Pretty cool, huh?

20:22.430 --> 20:23.723
Oh, hey, check this out.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.808
We have two
World View-4 satellites

20:25.850 --> 20:27.810
in geocentric orbit.

20:27.852 --> 20:30.146
We can essentially read
a getaway car's license plate

20:30.188 --> 20:32.065
from 380 miles up.

20:32.106 --> 20:34.484
That is just...

20:34.525 --> 20:36.110
I mean...

20:36.152 --> 20:38.029
G-- I was working with
a police scanner

20:38.071 --> 20:39.864
that I bought on eBay.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.408
(chuckles) Yeah, well,
not anymore you're not.

20:42.450 --> 20:45.286
Oh, and wait till you
check out the dining room.

20:45.328 --> 20:47.914
We, uh, may or may not
have stolen Miro

20:47.956 --> 20:49.958
from Gramercy Tavern.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.918
(laughs) Yeah, he's
fan-fucking-tastic.

20:51.960 --> 20:56.214
That's his, isn't it?

20:56.255 --> 20:58.883
Homelander's? Yeah.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.927
But you'll have your own soon.

21:00.969 --> 21:02.387
Here. Come on.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.721
Give it a test drive.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.683
(chuckles) Come on.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.810
O-Oh, you-you okay?

21:08.851 --> 21:11.229
It's just...

21:11.270 --> 21:13.314
(inhales, exhales sharply)

21:13.356 --> 21:17.360
I used to stand in the mirror,

21:17.402 --> 21:21.531
pretending to be
where I am right now.

21:21.572 --> 21:24.033
You know something?

21:24.075 --> 21:27.578
On my first day, I, uh...

21:27.620 --> 21:31.207
Well, I-I felt like a fraud.

21:31.249 --> 21:35.670
Yeah. But the good news is,
everybody feels that way.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.841
Thank you.

21:43.094 --> 21:45.346
And, hey, we're a team now.

21:45.388 --> 21:47.724
We'll help each other out.

21:47.765 --> 21:49.142
I bet growing up you had

21:49.183 --> 21:51.728
a poster of Homelander
on your wall, huh?

21:51.769 --> 21:55.606
No, actually, I...

21:55.648 --> 21:58.443
I don't know, Homelander's so--

21:58.484 --> 22:02.488
He's like Jesus or something.

22:02.530 --> 22:04.991
If you want to know the truth,

22:05.033 --> 22:07.827
I actually had a poster of you.

22:07.869 --> 22:09.954
(laughs) Really?

22:09.996 --> 22:12.165
-Yeah. Yeah. I kind of--
-Oh.

22:12.206 --> 22:15.793
I kind of had
a schoolgirl crush on you.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.212
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

22:18.254 --> 22:20.757
I hope that's not
inappropriate to say.

22:20.798 --> 22:22.550
No, no, no, no, no.
It's not inappropriate at all.

22:22.592 --> 22:25.386
-It's just, it's kind of wild.
-(sighs)

22:27.138 --> 22:28.806
(Deep sighs)

22:30.183 --> 22:32.268
(gasps)

22:32.310 --> 22:34.812
What? (chuckles)

22:34.854 --> 22:36.272
I mean, you said you had
a crush on me.

22:36.314 --> 22:37.774
I figured that, you know...

22:37.815 --> 22:39.692
-That is...
-Whoa, whoa, wh-wh-whoa, hey.

22:39.734 --> 22:41.277
Look, you're gorgeous.

22:41.319 --> 22:43.112
I'm not-- I'm not talking
about sex,

22:43.154 --> 22:45.073
just a little bit
of pole-smoking.

22:45.114 --> 22:46.949
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

22:46.991 --> 22:50.119
It's just a question of how bad
you want to be in The Seven.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.089
-Excuse me?
-(glass shattering)

23:01.130 --> 23:02.340
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.549
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.
(chuckles)

23:03.591 --> 23:06.719
Take it easy. (chuckles)

23:06.761 --> 23:09.097
Settle down. We're just,
we're just talking.

23:09.138 --> 23:12.100
And look, I know
that you're powerful.

23:12.141 --> 23:15.436
I get it.
Your powers are no joke.

23:15.478 --> 23:17.939
The thing is...

23:17.980 --> 23:20.358
I am number two around here.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.401
(sighs) So, like, if I say so,

23:22.443 --> 23:24.070
you know, you'd be out of here.

23:24.112 --> 23:27.156
Especially since
you attacked me.

23:27.198 --> 23:29.158
I what?

23:29.200 --> 23:31.619
Yeah. Look.

23:31.661 --> 23:35.748
I mean, Iowa's sweetheart,
the Defender of Des Moines,

23:35.790 --> 23:38.376
just went psycho on the Deep.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.087
(exhales) I mean, that...

23:41.129 --> 23:42.839
that could put you
out of the business.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.383
Yeah. (exhales sharply)

23:45.424 --> 23:48.719
I mean, home to Mommy,
tail tucked between your legs.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.555
Just think of all those kids.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.557
I mean, the kids.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.767
Those kids who look up to you,

23:54.809 --> 23:57.520
they'd just be shattered.

23:57.562 --> 24:00.022
(exhales)

24:00.064 --> 24:03.151
I mean, th-that's not
what you really want, right?

24:03.192 --> 24:06.362
Or we come together as a team.

24:06.404 --> 24:10.032
You and me, we just roll
with the punches,

24:10.074 --> 24:13.035
for, like, three minutes, maybe.

24:13.077 --> 24:15.037
It's not a big deal.

24:15.079 --> 24:18.332
And then you know what happens?

24:18.374 --> 24:20.751
All your dreams come true.

24:25.089 --> 24:26.883
I-I'm sure you guys
have all heard

24:26.924 --> 24:30.178
that Translucent stopped
a home invasion

24:30.219 --> 24:31.721
in Yonkers last night,
a young, single mother

24:31.762 --> 24:33.306
-and her two kids.
-(cheers and applause)

24:33.347 --> 24:35.808
Just incredible. Just...

24:35.850 --> 24:38.769
So tell us, how are you able
to-to vanish?

24:38.811 --> 24:40.271
No, I don't actually vanish.

24:40.313 --> 24:44.525
My skin turns into this
carbon meta-material

24:44.567 --> 24:45.526
that bends the light.

24:45.568 --> 24:47.278
Like an invisibility cloak.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.905
All right,
but just to be clear,

24:48.946 --> 24:50.948
you have to be
completely naked, right?

24:50.990 --> 24:52.867
(TV audience reacts)

24:52.909 --> 24:55.536
I appreciate you coming on
the show, my man. I love you.

24:55.578 --> 24:57.663
You guys stay tuned for
a behind-the-scenes look

24:57.705 --> 24:59.999
at Invisible Force 2, and
later, Translucent himself...

25:00.041 --> 25:01.667
(clears throat)

25:01.709 --> 25:04.462
You interested in a nanny cam?

25:04.503 --> 25:06.047
'Cause we're actually running
a special on that.

25:06.088 --> 25:07.423
Um, it's a pretty popular bear.

25:07.465 --> 25:09.008
There's cameras in the eyes.

25:09.050 --> 25:10.509
BUTCHER:
Tell me,

25:10.551 --> 25:13.137
how many nannies shake
their babies?

25:13.179 --> 25:15.556
Uh, I'm sorry?

25:15.598 --> 25:19.769
You know, a good...
hard shake, like...

25:19.810 --> 25:23.022
like tryin' to get ketchup
out of a bottle.

25:23.064 --> 25:25.483
One percent? Less?

25:25.524 --> 25:27.485
I-I don't really know.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.362
Funny, that.

25:29.403 --> 25:33.074
They sell a billion dollars
worth of that shit worldwide.

25:33.115 --> 25:35.326
Goes to show you, doesn't it?

25:35.368 --> 25:37.828
The bollocks people
will believe

25:37.870 --> 25:39.830
if you get them scared enough.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.708
(scoffs) Cool.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.669
Cool, cool.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.254
Um...

25:46.295 --> 25:48.714
Is there anything I can
help you with today, or...?

25:48.756 --> 25:51.509
I'm not gonna piss you about,
Hughie.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.928
I heard what happened to Robin.

25:53.970 --> 25:55.054
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry,
who are you?

25:55.096 --> 25:56.430
She wasn't in the street.

25:56.472 --> 25:58.307
She was one step off
the fucking curb.

25:58.349 --> 26:00.518
And you didn't take the pay-off.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.811
Yeah. I said,
who the hell are you?

26:01.852 --> 26:02.895
How do you know that?

26:02.937 --> 26:04.647
Name's Butcher.

26:04.689 --> 26:06.315
Billy Butcher.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.652
Listen, I was thinking that, uh,

26:09.694 --> 26:13.572
you and me should have
a little bit of a chat.

26:15.199 --> 26:17.076
Y-You're a Fed?

26:17.118 --> 26:18.911
You don't sound like a Fed.

26:18.953 --> 26:20.746
What, I can't immigrate?

26:20.788 --> 26:22.248
There's a giant green slapper
with her ass in the harbor

26:22.290 --> 26:23.749
that says different.

26:23.791 --> 26:24.959
You don't really look
like one, either.

26:25.001 --> 26:26.836
No? What do I look like?

26:26.877 --> 26:30.131
Like you're starring in
a porn version of The Matrix.

26:30.172 --> 26:32.216
Well, it's all right there
in black and white.

26:32.258 --> 26:35.052
Okay. Uh, what exactly
can I do for you?

26:35.094 --> 26:36.846
No, you got it all wrong,
Hughie.

26:36.887 --> 26:38.764
It's what I can do for you.

26:38.806 --> 26:40.683
You see, you ain't alone, son.

26:40.725 --> 26:42.935
It happens a lot more
than you think.

26:42.977 --> 26:46.230
Supes lose hundreds of people
each year to collateral damage.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.357
No. Come on, that'd be
all over the news.

26:48.399 --> 26:50.026
People would be screaming
bloody murder.

26:50.067 --> 26:51.527
Yeah, look, there might be
the odd mention

26:51.569 --> 26:53.070
of it now and again,
like with Robin,

26:53.112 --> 26:54.655
but there's a fuck-sight more
that happens

26:54.697 --> 26:56.866
that just gets swept
right under the rug.

26:56.907 --> 26:59.327
Why?

27:01.203 --> 27:03.205
Ain't it obvious?

27:03.247 --> 27:05.916
Movie tickets, merchandising,

27:05.958 --> 27:08.419
theme parks, video games.

27:08.461 --> 27:11.172
A multi-billion dollar
global industry supported

27:11.213 --> 27:13.174
by corporate lobbyists

27:13.215 --> 27:15.968
and politicians on both sides.

27:16.010 --> 27:19.138
But the main reason
that you won't hear about it

27:19.180 --> 27:22.308
is 'cause the public don't
want to know about it.

27:22.350 --> 27:26.062
See, people love that cozy
feeling that Supes give them.

27:26.103 --> 27:27.605
Some golden cunt

27:27.646 --> 27:30.191
to swoop out of the sky
and save the day

27:30.232 --> 27:32.777
so you don't got
to do it yourself.

27:32.818 --> 27:35.863
But if you knew half the shit
they get up to...

27:35.905 --> 27:38.532
Ooh... (clucks tongue)

27:38.574 --> 27:40.618
Fuckin' diabolical.

27:40.659 --> 27:44.789
But then...
that's where I come in.

27:44.830 --> 27:47.666
Come in to... to do what?

27:47.708 --> 27:51.212
Spank the bastards
when they get out of line.

27:51.253 --> 27:53.506
How do you spank a Supe?

27:53.547 --> 27:55.549
Come on, son.

27:55.591 --> 27:57.635
Uh, where?

27:57.676 --> 27:59.053
You'll love it.

27:59.095 --> 28:00.262
Uh, not likely.

28:00.304 --> 28:01.430
Uh, listen.

28:01.472 --> 28:03.933
I think this is good; I'm good.

28:03.974 --> 28:06.936
Uh, thank you for
an extremely weird conversation,

28:06.977 --> 28:09.688
but, uh, I don't want to go
to a second location with you.

28:09.730 --> 28:12.024
So, I'm gonna get back
to work.

28:12.066 --> 28:13.484
Thank you.

28:13.526 --> 28:17.655
Hughie! Hughie.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.865
(sighs)

28:19.907 --> 28:21.992
This is your one and only, mate.

28:22.034 --> 28:25.079
Once I go, I'm gone.

28:25.121 --> 28:28.040
I'm offering you the opportunity

28:28.082 --> 28:31.001
to get them that got your girl.

28:32.253 --> 28:34.713
What have you got to lose

28:34.755 --> 28:38.300
that you ain't already lost?

28:57.695 --> 29:00.448
Where are we?

29:00.489 --> 29:02.783
Keep your mouth shut.

29:04.285 --> 29:05.703
Harry.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.288
Got your message.

29:07.329 --> 29:09.790
Thank you for being
an upstanding citizen.

29:09.832 --> 29:11.792
You know this is fucking
police brutality, man.

29:11.834 --> 29:14.920
You know what they'll do to me,
they catch me letting you in?

29:14.962 --> 29:18.841
Not half of what I'll do
if you don't.

29:19.925 --> 29:23.554
Did he just say
you were police?

29:23.596 --> 29:26.515
Yeah, you know, cop, Fed,
all the same to twats like that.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.146
(door closes)

29:32.188 --> 29:34.148
(loud, indistinct chatter)

29:37.735 --> 29:40.362
Holy shit.

29:40.404 --> 29:42.239
Pick your jaw up off the floor

29:42.281 --> 29:43.908
and try to blend in.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.743
This is the only place

29:45.784 --> 29:49.205
where the Supes can scratch
their filthy little itch

29:49.246 --> 29:51.499
without the paps taking snaps.

29:51.540 --> 29:53.209
♪ I did a bad, bad thing ♪

29:53.250 --> 29:55.169

-♪ I did a bad, bad thing ♪

Wait, wait, wait.
That's Ezekiel.

29:56.921 --> 29:59.089

30:01.467 --> 30:03.427

30:04.845 --> 30:07.640

30:07.681 --> 30:09.892
BUTCHER: And now he's

Fucking hypocrite.

That's it. Further.

30:24.490 --> 30:25.616
Further.

30:25.658 --> 30:26.867
There. There.

30:26.909 --> 30:28.827
-Stop.
-HUGHIE: Wait, wait, wait.

30:28.869 --> 30:31.163
A-Train's...
A-Train's here right now?

30:31.205 --> 30:33.499
Was. This is from last night.

30:33.541 --> 30:35.167
Turn it up.

30:36.418 --> 30:38.796
I cannot believe
you ran through a bitch.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.423
A-TRAIN: You want to hear
something crazy?

30:41.465 --> 30:44.301
I ran so fast
through this bitch

30:44.343 --> 30:46.554
that I swallowed
one of her molars.

30:46.595 --> 30:49.848
Like a bug
on the fucking freeway.

30:49.890 --> 30:52.226
Dude, that's nasty.

30:52.268 --> 30:54.520
(both laughing)

30:54.562 --> 30:57.523
They're laughing.

30:57.565 --> 31:00.818
Just... Like she's a joke.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.319
(laughter continues)

31:02.361 --> 31:05.114
They're fucking laughing.

31:10.661 --> 31:13.581
So what are you
gonna do about it?

31:18.043 --> 31:20.296
(Starlight vomiting)

31:20.337 --> 31:23.007
(retches, pants)

31:24.008 --> 31:26.135
(toilet flushes)

31:38.897 --> 31:40.733
(water running)

31:47.906 --> 31:50.117
-(water stops)
-(Starlight sniffles)

31:52.202 --> 31:54.204
Oh, for Chrissakes.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.790
Clean yourself up.

31:56.832 --> 31:59.418
Never let them see you
like this.

32:01.295 --> 32:03.255
-(sighs)
-Translucent,

32:03.297 --> 32:05.299
you're a goddamn pervert.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.261
Ah...

32:11.013 --> 32:13.599
Oh, uh...

32:13.641 --> 32:15.768
I'll just go.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.813
HUGHIE:
They're all like that?

32:19.855 --> 32:22.316
All of them?
Even Homelander?

32:23.484 --> 32:25.736
Homelander's the exception.

32:25.778 --> 32:27.780
He doesn't drink, doesn't smoke.

32:27.821 --> 32:29.907
Man's a saint.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.617
But the rest of 'em, yeah.

32:31.659 --> 32:34.036
Pardon my French,
fuck those fuckers.

32:34.078 --> 32:35.621
Here.

32:35.663 --> 32:38.040
Have a shufti of that.

32:38.082 --> 32:40.042
-What are these?
-That's the police log

32:40.084 --> 32:42.544
the day that Robin got murdered.

32:42.586 --> 32:45.839
Couple of bar fights.
A few cars got nicked.

32:45.881 --> 32:48.342
But you know
what's not in there?

32:48.384 --> 32:51.095
No bank alarms going off.

32:51.136 --> 32:53.389
No one charged
at Central Booking.

32:53.430 --> 32:55.724
A-Train stopped
two bank robbers, my arse.

32:55.766 --> 32:58.102
Someone's fucking
hiding something.

32:58.143 --> 33:00.229
-Hiding what?
-Well, I don't know,

33:00.270 --> 33:03.107
whatever dodgy shit
he was up to that night.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.484
Why couldn't he stop?
I mean, what was in that bag?

33:05.526 --> 33:07.528
You know?
Who was he running from?

33:07.569 --> 33:10.114
-Or where was he running to?
-Bingo.

33:10.155 --> 33:13.909
Work that out, and we'll have
the fucker, I can smell it.

33:13.951 --> 33:15.786
Okay.

33:17.287 --> 33:19.498
Okay, so, um...

33:19.540 --> 33:21.583
what can I do to help?

33:21.625 --> 33:23.919
Here's what you do.

33:23.961 --> 33:26.922
Ring Vought, tell 'em you'll
take the money, sign the NDA,

33:26.964 --> 33:30.008
but only if A-Train's there
in person when you do it.

33:30.050 --> 33:31.385
Why does A-Train need
to be there?

33:31.427 --> 33:32.678
Then they'll take you
into The Seven Tower,

33:32.720 --> 33:33.929
through security, mate,

33:33.971 --> 33:35.931
-and then you're gonna
plant a bug.
-A bug?

33:35.973 --> 33:38.142
A bug. And we'll have
a little listen.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.394
See what's really going on.

33:40.436 --> 33:43.063
Okay, let me just... sorry,
let me just get this straight.

33:43.105 --> 33:46.567
You want me to... you want me
to go to Seven Tower by myself,

33:46.608 --> 33:48.902
and-and you want me
to plant a bug,

33:48.944 --> 33:51.530
like I'm... what,
like I'm fuckin' James Bond?

33:51.572 --> 33:54.158
-Yeah, exactly. You got it.
-You're FBI.

33:54.199 --> 33:55.868
If you're FBI,
then get a warrant.

33:55.909 --> 33:58.162
-Why do you...
why do you even need me?
-Hughie, Hughie,

33:58.203 --> 34:00.664
look, mate,
I got a warrant, all right?

34:00.706 --> 34:03.375
But that place is firewalled,
untappable,

34:03.417 --> 34:05.127
and locked up tighter
than a nun's knickers.

34:05.169 --> 34:07.296
I couldn't get myself in there
in a million years.

34:07.337 --> 34:08.964
But you, son, you could do it.

34:09.006 --> 34:10.758
-No, no, I can't, okay?
-Yeah.

34:10.799 --> 34:12.885
I can't. No. You didn't see
A-Train covered in...

34:12.926 --> 34:15.095
And-and I'm, what, I'm
just supposed to go in there,

34:15.137 --> 34:17.473
and I'm supposed to...
I'm supposed to shake his hand?

34:17.514 --> 34:19.516
-And smile?
-Yeah.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.935
I'm not... Do you know
who my favorite musician is?

34:21.977 --> 34:23.729
-Who?
-James Taylor.

34:23.771 --> 34:26.690
Number two, Simon & Garfunkel.
Number three, Billy Joel.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.359
Any of those guys,
they don't infiltrate.

34:29.401 --> 34:31.695
Okay? I'm not an infiltrator.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.155
Hughie, Hughie,
fucking grow a pair.

34:33.197 --> 34:34.656
You heard that cunt
laughing at your girl.

34:34.698 --> 34:36.325
No. No. No.

34:36.366 --> 34:38.619
No, I can't.
I can't do that.

34:38.660 --> 34:40.788
I'm sorry,
I'm just gonna fuck it up,

34:40.829 --> 34:42.790
and you're not
gonna have your bug...

34:42.831 --> 34:44.833
(panting):
...and I'll be dead.

34:46.251 --> 34:48.378
I'm not... I'm not like you.

34:49.797 --> 34:51.298
(door opens)

34:51.340 --> 34:52.633
(door closes)

34:54.927 --> 34:56.512
(chuckles):
This is amazing, Madelyn.

34:56.553 --> 34:58.806
Thank you for this.
My kid is gonna lose his mind.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.933
Ah, it is our pleasure.

35:00.974 --> 35:02.893
Just do not sell it online.

35:02.935 --> 35:04.394
(Madelyn chuckles)

35:04.436 --> 35:06.647
All right.
What are you thinking?

35:06.688 --> 35:08.357
Baltimore is a beautiful town.

35:08.398 --> 35:11.109
But you've got a problem.

35:11.151 --> 35:15.072
Your homicide rates
are up, what, 62%?

35:15.113 --> 35:16.824
The police
are not closing cases.

35:16.865 --> 35:18.700
You're on the verge
of needing a federal lifeline.

35:18.742 --> 35:20.536
Cut to the chase, Madelyn.

35:20.577 --> 35:22.371
Who are you proposing?

35:23.372 --> 35:24.998
Nubian Prince.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.959
Fits your population's demo,

35:27.000 --> 35:28.794
but not too militant.

35:28.836 --> 35:30.963
Caucasians love him,
too, with a...

35:31.004 --> 35:33.090
59% approval rate.

35:33.131 --> 35:37.344
I am willing to give you
a three-year exclusive contract

35:37.386 --> 35:39.388
with full PR support,

35:39.429 --> 35:42.057
and I'm gonna give you
nine and a half points

35:42.099 --> 35:44.184
of the merchandising.

35:44.226 --> 35:46.061
I thought he was in Detroit.

35:46.103 --> 35:48.146
Well, we're thinking
about making a move.

35:48.188 --> 35:49.982
How much?

35:50.023 --> 35:52.526
-$300 million a year.
-(laughs)

35:52.568 --> 35:54.820
(both laughing)

35:56.280 --> 35:58.657
I know, I know,
it's a tough swallow.

35:58.699 --> 36:01.410
But we both know that
your city needs a hero.

36:03.453 --> 36:06.540
$200 million for Nubian Prince.

36:06.582 --> 36:08.959
-I can sell that.
-Mm.

36:09.001 --> 36:11.545
I'm sorry, Steve, I can't do it.

36:11.587 --> 36:14.089
We've got Atlanta waiting
in the wings.

36:14.131 --> 36:16.675
-I think maybe you can.
-(chuckles)

36:16.717 --> 36:18.343
And why is that?

36:20.971 --> 36:23.807
I happen to know
about Compound V.

36:27.102 --> 36:28.729
What is Compound V?

36:28.770 --> 36:30.647
It's the type of rumor

36:30.689 --> 36:32.900
that could really tarnish
those heroes of yours.

36:32.941 --> 36:34.526
Nobody wants that.

36:34.568 --> 36:36.236
People need heroes.

36:36.278 --> 36:39.072
Now, I can make sure
that that stays a rumor,

36:39.114 --> 36:41.074
because I'm a friend.

36:41.116 --> 36:44.369
But friendship
does cut both ways.

36:44.411 --> 36:48.290
I'm sorry, Steve, I don't know
what you're talking about.

36:48.332 --> 36:51.209
$300 million is the price,

36:51.251 --> 36:53.837
or we go to Atlanta.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.591
DONNA:
So, how amazing is it?

36:57.633 --> 36:59.176
What's Homelander like?

36:59.217 --> 37:01.094
Uh... he's busy.

37:01.136 --> 37:03.555
I haven't really
met him yet, but...

37:05.265 --> 37:07.517
Mom, I got to tell you
what happened.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.353
Oh, I forgot.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.271
I was playing mah-jongg
with Patty and Trish,

37:11.313 --> 37:13.523
and Patty is going on and on
about how her daughter

37:13.565 --> 37:16.234
got into med school,
and I'm thinking, so what?

37:16.276 --> 37:18.195
My daughter got into The Seven!

37:18.236 --> 37:21.907
Anyway, so-so,
what did you want to tell me?

37:23.492 --> 37:26.119
Everything's great.

37:26.161 --> 37:28.205
Just how we dreamed.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.706
Um...

37:29.748 --> 37:32.334
Mom, actually, you know what?
I have to go.

37:32.376 --> 37:34.294
All right. Bye, honey.

37:44.513 --> 37:45.931
(sniffles)

37:48.433 --> 37:50.769
(takes deep,
shuddering breath)

37:55.565 --> 37:57.109
Um...

37:57.150 --> 37:58.652
excuse me.

37:58.694 --> 38:00.696
I'm sorry, a-are you okay?

38:00.737 --> 38:02.531
Just seemed like a...

38:02.572 --> 38:04.700
tough call.

38:04.741 --> 38:06.535
Sorry.
I don't mean to bother you.

38:06.576 --> 38:07.953
No, no, it's okay.

38:07.995 --> 38:09.162
Uh...

38:09.204 --> 38:11.748
I'm fine.
I'm just...

38:11.790 --> 38:14.209
I'm just having a bad day.

38:14.251 --> 38:17.129
(chuckles):
Yeah, me, too.

38:17.170 --> 38:20.173
Uh... is it, like,
a-a work thing, or...

38:20.215 --> 38:23.051
a-a life thing?

38:23.093 --> 38:26.054
(smacks lips)
It's a work thing.

38:27.222 --> 38:28.849
You?

38:28.890 --> 38:31.977
Uh... life thing.

38:34.646 --> 38:38.400
You know how you have this...

38:38.442 --> 38:40.861
image of yourself?

38:41.903 --> 38:44.614
Like, I thought I was strong.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.616
You know?
Like, made of steel.

38:46.658 --> 38:47.951
A fighter.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.411
And...

38:49.453 --> 38:52.122
then I was faced
with this horrible situation

38:52.164 --> 38:54.416
with this asshole...

38:54.458 --> 38:57.210
and...

38:57.252 --> 39:01.381
I just heard my mom's voice
in my head,

39:01.423 --> 39:03.300
"Keep smiling,

39:03.341 --> 39:05.927
the show must go on,"

39:05.969 --> 39:09.139
and... I didn't fight.

39:09.181 --> 39:12.476
And now I just feel sick.

39:12.517 --> 39:15.520
Partly because I did it, but...

39:15.562 --> 39:17.564
mostly because...

39:19.274 --> 39:24.237
...turns out I'm
not who I thought I was.

39:26.198 --> 39:28.116
(sighs)

39:28.158 --> 39:31.161
-Oh. Oh, I'm, um, sorry.
-Uh...

39:31.203 --> 39:33.997
I-I didn't mean
to just dump all of that

39:34.039 --> 39:37.834
-onto you.
-No, no, it's totally fine
that you dumped. Um...

39:40.378 --> 39:43.381
Listen, d-do you like your job?

39:43.423 --> 39:44.925
Oh.

39:44.966 --> 39:47.469
It's the only thing
I've ever wanted.

39:47.511 --> 39:49.221
And it's a good job?

39:49.262 --> 39:52.140
Like, you're not
selling kids smack?

39:52.182 --> 39:54.559
No, it's a great job.

39:54.601 --> 39:57.312
I could help a lot of people.

39:57.354 --> 40:00.148
Thing is, I, um...

40:00.190 --> 40:03.110
used to know this girl,

40:03.151 --> 40:06.321
and we used to go skating
at Rockefeller,

40:06.363 --> 40:08.240
and I'd be on the side

40:08.281 --> 40:10.242
with this death grip
on the rails.

40:10.283 --> 40:13.787
She would just charge headfirst
into the middle of the rink.

40:13.829 --> 40:17.165
And she wasn't... good.

40:17.207 --> 40:19.251
Like, she fell--

40:19.292 --> 40:21.628
a lot--

40:21.670 --> 40:24.131
but she was never scared.

40:28.051 --> 40:30.470
And she always used to say:

40:30.512 --> 40:33.098
"Just 'cause you fall
on your ass doesn't mean

40:33.140 --> 40:36.059
you have to stay there."

40:36.101 --> 40:38.395
So you fell on your ass,
you know?

40:38.436 --> 40:40.856
That's not who you are.

40:42.524 --> 40:44.776
So who are you?

40:50.824 --> 40:52.909
I'm a fighter.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.621
I'm gonna fight.

40:57.664 --> 40:59.457
Yeah.

40:59.499 --> 41:02.794
I'm gonna take
that son of a bitch's head

41:02.836 --> 41:06.339
-clean off his body.
-Okay. Wow, that was...

41:06.381 --> 41:08.049
Okay.

41:08.091 --> 41:10.051
-Cool.
-(exhales)

41:10.093 --> 41:11.386
Little scary, but...

41:11.428 --> 41:13.430
but-but cool.

41:15.515 --> 41:17.559
I'm-I'm Hughie, by the way.

41:17.601 --> 41:19.394
Annie.

41:25.984 --> 41:27.652
(door opens)

41:27.694 --> 41:29.279
(door closes)

41:34.868 --> 41:37.204
Okay, man. I'm in.

41:40.582 --> 41:43.084
Okay, it's ringing.

41:45.212 --> 41:46.630
DOUG:
Yeah, hello?

41:46.671 --> 41:47.964
Hi. Hi.

41:48.006 --> 41:50.008
Yes, hello.
Hello, Mr. Friedman.

41:50.050 --> 41:52.010
It's Hughie Campbell.
I got your message,

41:52.052 --> 41:53.845
and-and $45K, it's just...

41:53.887 --> 41:57.015
it's just... it's bingo,
like, life-changing.

41:57.057 --> 42:00.977
Um, but I just need one thing
before I-I sign anything.

42:01.019 --> 42:02.520
I need an apology

42:02.562 --> 42:04.856
-from A-Train.
-Uh, he already apologized.

42:04.898 --> 42:06.816
Well, no, no, no.

42:06.858 --> 42:08.443
No, he hasn't.
Yes, he sent his...

42:08.485 --> 42:11.529
he sent his regrets
and his sympathies on...

42:11.571 --> 42:13.865
(voice breaks):
on TV, but I-I...

42:13.907 --> 42:17.535
if I could just get
an apology face-to-face,

42:17.577 --> 42:19.204
that would be fantastic.

42:19.246 --> 42:20.705
Just to... just for closure,

42:20.747 --> 42:22.999
just to put...
just to put a b-button on it.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.960
Okay, yeah. But, uh...

42:25.001 --> 42:26.962
Hugh, I'm telling you,
the answer's gonna be no.

42:27.003 --> 42:28.755
All right, in that...
in that case, can you

42:28.797 --> 42:30.340
just give me-- Uh, hello?

42:30.382 --> 42:32.092
I think... They hung up.

42:32.133 --> 42:34.052
I don't think
they're gonna go for it.

42:34.094 --> 42:37.305
Hmm. Oh, yes, they will.

42:39.683 --> 42:41.935
(door opens)

42:41.977 --> 42:44.396
(takes deep breath)

42:54.239 --> 42:56.408
HOMELANDER:
Starlight.

42:56.449 --> 42:59.452
Don't want to be late
to your first official meeting.

43:00.745 --> 43:03.290
I had a whole
welcome speech planned.

43:03.331 --> 43:04.791
Sorry, sir.

43:04.833 --> 43:06.584
Please, Homelander's fine.

43:06.626 --> 43:08.920
Beginning to wonder
if you'd even show up.

43:08.962 --> 43:10.588
I mean, all that pressure,

43:10.630 --> 43:13.425
it's a lot
for anyone to swallow.

43:13.466 --> 43:15.802
Yeah. Don't worry, I'll be fine.

43:15.844 --> 43:17.304
I'm here,

43:17.345 --> 43:20.473
and I'm not going anywhere.

43:23.685 --> 43:25.228
TRANSLUCENT:
Can we get back to this, please?

43:25.270 --> 43:29.149
This is a serious crime.
These assholes pirated my movie

43:29.190 --> 43:30.483
three weeks before release,

43:30.525 --> 43:32.485
and you can't walk down
5th Avenue

43:32.527 --> 43:35.280
without bumping into a table
of unlicensed Homelander shirts.

43:35.322 --> 43:37.657
Copyright infringement
is costing Vought

43:37.699 --> 43:39.367
$1.2 billion per year.

43:39.409 --> 43:41.119
That's money out of our pockets.

43:41.161 --> 43:42.996
We've all got, what,
four points each?

43:43.038 --> 43:44.664
What the fuck?

43:44.706 --> 43:47.208
You got four points?

43:47.250 --> 43:49.336
And clearly better lawyers.

43:49.377 --> 43:52.005
Hey, hey, hey, guys, come on.

43:52.047 --> 43:53.631
Stop.

43:53.673 --> 43:55.508
What's Starlight gonna think?

43:55.550 --> 43:58.511
Listening to us haggling
over nickels.

43:58.553 --> 44:01.598
We're The Seven, for God's sake.

44:01.639 --> 44:04.684
Whether we're out there
or we're in here.

44:04.726 --> 44:07.354
Now, what I do want to hear

44:07.395 --> 44:10.106
is who you saved this week.

44:10.148 --> 44:11.524
Huh?

44:11.566 --> 44:12.776
Who's up for that?

44:12.817 --> 44:14.611
(chuckles)

44:14.652 --> 44:16.154
Black Noir.

44:17.572 --> 44:18.948
Let's start with you, man.

44:21.785 --> 44:23.828
(engine shuts off)

44:25.497 --> 44:26.831
Do you have a dog?

44:26.873 --> 44:28.249
No.

44:28.291 --> 44:30.418
All right, give us your phone.

44:30.460 --> 44:32.170
There's fuck-all security
to worry about.

44:32.212 --> 44:34.172
In fact,
they're a bunch of muppets.

44:34.214 --> 44:36.216
And the metal detector
won't pick this up.

44:36.257 --> 44:38.676
Right? And what
they'll probably do is take you

44:38.718 --> 44:41.179
through the security
and then up into the boardroom.

44:41.221 --> 44:43.807
Sit down. Be nice, congenial.

44:43.848 --> 44:47.143
Then, real polite-like, tell 'em
you're gonna take a fake shit.

44:47.185 --> 44:49.270
Go into the bog,
take the bug out.

44:49.312 --> 44:51.523
Peel back the plastic bit
to reveal the sticky side.

44:51.564 --> 44:54.651
Put the plastic bit in the bog.
Flush it.

44:54.692 --> 44:57.070
Then go back into the boardroom,

44:57.112 --> 44:58.988
sit down-- big smiles--

44:59.030 --> 45:00.990
plant the bug
underneath the table.

45:01.032 --> 45:02.826
Easy peasy Japanesey.

45:02.867 --> 45:05.078
Bob's your uncle. That's that.

45:05.120 --> 45:07.580
-That's that?
That was-- that was a lot.
-Yeah.

45:07.622 --> 45:09.916
Th-- I've-- Hold on, can you
just-- can you repeat it again?

45:09.958 --> 45:11.167
Just a little bit slower?
Because I...

45:11.209 --> 45:13.044
Shh. Listen.

45:13.086 --> 45:15.672
-Fuck. (exhales)
-Hughie, calm down, all right?

45:15.713 --> 45:18.341
This is like that scene
in The Matrix.

45:18.383 --> 45:21.970
Now, you could take
the fucking red pill, right?

45:22.011 --> 45:24.055
Spend the rest of your life
jacking off,

45:24.097 --> 45:26.808
crying into your chai tea

45:26.850 --> 45:29.185
green latte,
what the fuck. Or...

45:29.227 --> 45:31.938
you could take the blue pill.

45:31.980 --> 45:34.691
Or is it the red pill?
Anyway, take the other pill

45:34.732 --> 45:36.901
-and quit being a cunt.
