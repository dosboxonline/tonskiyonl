01:26.295 --> 01:28.005

01:28.005 --> 01:29.423
You've got a choice, son.

01:29.423 --> 01:32.384

01:35.304 --> 01:38.724
Now, please. It's me, Coach Brink.

01:38.724 --> 01:41.477
Come back with me.

01:41.477 --> 01:43.562
To the suburbs.

01:45.481 --> 01:47.483
Yeah, what I want doesn't matter.

01:48.734 --> 01:50.778
I'll never be free of these streets.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.030

02:07.962 --> 02:10.214
I'm not giving off too much

02:12.550 --> 02:13.717
Are you-- Wait, what is that smell?

02:13.717 --> 02:15.511
Will everyone stop?

02:15.511 --> 02:17.179
What is that smell?!

02:17.179 --> 02:19.473
[sniffs] Is it... Is that you?

02:19.473 --> 02:20.975
I had falafel for lunch.

02:20.975 --> 02:22.643
- [sniffs]
- What?

02:22.643 --> 02:25.312
I smell an Oscar nomination.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.647
Shut up, man.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.400
- [Bourke] No, I won't.
- [Ferrell] Don't jinx it.

02:29.400 --> 02:30.860
You can't jinx gold. Look at me.

02:30.860 --> 02:33.988
You better make some shelf space,
De Niro. Do you hear me?

02:33.988 --> 02:35.781
All right, let's get you back to one, huh?

02:35.781 --> 02:37.116
- I'm gonna watch playbacks, okay?
- Absolutely.

02:37.116 --> 02:39.910
Yeah, let's get him some cans, please?
Thank you.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.704
One more quick thing.

02:41.704 --> 02:43.038
Let's sidebar here a little bit.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.707
It feels like you're having
a little bit of trouble

02:44.707 --> 02:46.292
getting out of the starters' block.

02:47.293 --> 02:49.003
Maybe it's the scene.

02:49.003 --> 02:50.421
Baby, this scene sings.
All right, look at me.

02:50.421 --> 02:54.133
In the arc of your character,
this is your low point, right?

02:54.133 --> 02:56.343
Everybody's given up on you,
you're all alone,

02:56.343 --> 02:57.469
until the coach--

02:57.469 --> 03:00.097
Swoops in and saves me from the ghetto?

03:00.097 --> 03:01.348
No, no, no, you actually save each other.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.225
It's a very balanced narrative.

03:03.225 --> 03:06.812
All the sensitivity readers
that we hired, they all agreed.

03:06.812 --> 03:08.939
- My brother was the only coach I ever had.
- Right.

03:08.939 --> 03:11.025
He was a waiter at Buster Beaver,

03:11.025 --> 03:12.610
not a fucking crack dealer.

03:13.736 --> 03:15.738
And he must be so proud of you right now.

03:15.738 --> 03:18.824
Let's get this train back on the tracks.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.161
- Just give me a minute.
- Yeah, sure.

03:23.245 --> 03:25.539
Wait, wait, you know what?
One more tiny little thing.

03:25.539 --> 03:29.293
You said what I want "doesn't matter."

03:29.293 --> 03:30.753
But as scripted, it's actually

03:30.753 --> 03:33.923
what I want "don't matter," okay?

03:33.923 --> 03:35.007
All right, good stuff.

03:35.007 --> 03:37.301
All right, everybody,
let's get back to one!

03:37.301 --> 03:39.261
I want to make this fucking day!

03:42.348 --> 03:44.224
Hey, can we talk?

03:44.224 --> 03:46.602
You don't talk. It's like your one thing.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.312
Look, playing Noir has been
a meaningful challenge,

03:48.312 --> 03:49.563
but yesterday was wack as fuck.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.816
I've never actually
murdered anyone before.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.652
Does Homelander make us
kill people, like, a lot?

03:54.652 --> 03:57.196
And when he does, do we just... do it?

03:58.614 --> 04:00.741
Look, don't get me wrong,
I am stoked to be here

04:00.741 --> 04:04.078
and I am down to ride the wave.
I'm just having trouble

04:04.078 --> 04:05.371
with Noir's motivation, you feel me?

04:05.371 --> 04:08.248
His motivation is being
a braindead maniac.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.042
Just keep your mouth shut

04:10.042 --> 04:11.835
and do as you're fucking told.

But deep in his heart, he knows
he's different, special.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.027
He's always asking himself, "Who am I?"

10:10.027 --> 10:11.695

He always knew he
was destined for greatness.

10:33.342 --> 10:36.553
Oh, buddy, can you believe that?

10:36.553 --> 10:38.555
W-What do you think?

10:38.555 --> 10:42.142

10:53.028 --> 10:55.822

10:58.575 --> 11:00.786

11:00.786 --> 11:03.288

after Gunpowder.

11:03.288 --> 11:04.539

11:04.539 --> 11:05.707
[Homelander] Yeah, but I don't think Ryan

11:05.707 --> 11:09.044

against me. [laughs]

11:09.044 --> 11:11.505

- A what?

11:11.505 --> 11:13.590
Ryan is the first natural-born superhero.

11:13.590 --> 11:14.841
And his brand needs to reflect that.

11:14.841 --> 11:17.636
He's not one of Vought's lab rat freaks.

11:23.058 --> 11:24.309
[Homelander] Yes.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.436

11:29.398 --> 11:30.857

13:37.359 --> 13:38.443
I want to talk to you about something.

13:38.443 --> 13:39.861

13:39.861 --> 13:43.156
[clears throat] Okay, so, what if...

13:43.156 --> 13:44.866

13:44.866 --> 13:47.994

13:49.955 --> 13:52.582
That's it. That's the pitch.

equivalent of a capybara.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.034

- It's a giant rodent from South America.
