00:25.959 --> 00:30.692
<i>Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.</i>

00:30.797 --> 00:33.994
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done…

00:34.100 --> 00:37.365
on Earth as it is in heaven.

00:37.470 --> 00:40.240
Give us this day our daily bread…

00:40.340 --> 00:42.542
and forgive us our trespasses…

00:42.642 --> 00:46.703
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

00:46.813 --> 00:49.941
And lead us not into temptation…

00:50.050 --> 00:52.917
but deliver us from evil.

00:53.019 --> 00:56.420
For Thine is the kingdom, the power…

00:56.523 --> 01:00.823
and the glory now and forever.

01:00.927 --> 01:02.927
–Amen.
–Amen.

01:06.666 --> 01:08.646
Thank you, Father Macklepenny…

01:08.668 --> 01:13.206
for coming all the way
across town to be our guest speaker.

01:13.306 --> 01:16.111
<i>When I raise my flashing sword…</i>

01:17.310 --> 01:20.455
<i>and my hand takes hold on judgment…</i>

01:22.315 --> 01:25.715
<i>I will take vengeance
upon mine enemies.</i>

01:26.419 --> 01:29.479
<i>And I will repay those who haste me.</i>

01:30.156 --> 01:33.159
<i>O Lord, raise me to Thy right hand…</i>

01:33.259 --> 01:35.809
<i>and count me among Thy saints.</i>

01:41.267 --> 01:44.412
And I am reminded on this holy day…

01:45.572 --> 01:49.338
<i>of the sad story of Kitty Genovese.</i>

01:52.078 --> 01:55.980
<i>As you all may remember…</i>

01:56.082 --> 01:59.119
a long time ago,
almost 30 years ago…

01:59.219 --> 02:03.349
<i>this poor soul cried out for help…</i>

02:03.456 --> 02:05.981
<i>time and time again…</i>

02:06.092 --> 02:09.960
<i>but no person answered her calls.</i>

02:11.764 --> 02:13.959
Though many saw…

02:14.067 --> 02:17.127
no one so much as called the police.

02:18.771 --> 02:23.786
<i>They all just watched as Kitty
was being stabbed to death…</i>

02:24.244 --> 02:26.576
in broad daylight.

02:26.679 --> 02:31.275
They watched as
her assailant walked away.

02:33.386 --> 02:37.982
Now, we must all fear evil men.

02:39.959 --> 02:43.190
<i>But there is another kind of evil…</i>

02:43.296 --> 02:45.924
which we must fear most…

02:48.101 --> 02:51.798
and that is the indifference…

02:51.905 --> 02:55.170
<i>of good men!</i>

03:14.928 --> 03:18.091
I do believe the monsignor's
finally got the point.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.131
Aye.

03:54.601 --> 03:56.601
<i>Hey, Conner!</i>

04:04.744 --> 04:06.744
What?

04:17.656 --> 04:20.023
Yeah!
Who's the master?

04:26.899 --> 04:28.861
You're gonna be training her today.

04:28.901 --> 04:31.426
Aye.

04:38.711 --> 04:43.896
–Basically, the rule of thumb here is—
–Wait. Rule of thumb?

04:49.322 --> 04:53.253
In the early 1900s, it was legal
for men to beat their wives…

04:53.293 --> 04:57.883
as long as they used a stick
no wider than their thumb.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.131
Can't do much damage
with that then, can we?

05:05.171 --> 05:08.996
Perhaps it should've been
the “rule of wrist.”

05:12.412 --> 05:14.507
I knew you two pricks
would give me problems.

05:14.547 --> 05:17.243
Come on. It's St Patty's Day.
It's all in good fun.

05:17.283 --> 05:19.833
Ah, fuck you!
And fuck you too!

05:20.620 --> 05:23.935
We're sorry, all right?
Just relax.

05:26.559 --> 05:28.652
Oh, shit.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.070
Hey, fuck-ass, give me a beer.

06:40.500 --> 06:44.095
Listen, boys, I've got some very bad news.

06:44.203 --> 06:48.196
I'm gonna have to close down t-t-the bar.

06:48.307 --> 06:53.279
The Russians are buying up buildings
all over the town, includin' this one.

06:53.379 --> 06:55.609
Fuck! Ass!

06:55.715 --> 06:58.311
And they're not lettin' me renew my lease.

06:58.351 --> 07:01.184
Let me talk to my boss.

07:01.287 --> 07:05.118
–Maybe he can do something.
–What the fuck's your boss gonna do?

07:05.158 --> 07:08.020
Listen, fellas,
I don't want anyone to know.

07:08.060 --> 07:10.129
So you keep your traps shut!

07:10.229 --> 07:15.414
You know what they say:
people in glass houses sink s-s-ships.

07:18.838 --> 07:22.068
Hey, Doc, I gotta buy you,
like, a proverb book or somethin'.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.610
This mix-and-match shit's gotta go.

07:24.710 --> 07:26.079
What?

07:26.179 --> 07:28.508
A penny saved is worth
two in the bush, isn't it?

07:28.548 --> 07:33.648
And don't cross the road
if you can't get out of the kitchen.

07:39.859 --> 07:41.761
What's this, then?

07:41.861 --> 07:46.889
I am Ivan Checkov,
and you will be closing now.

07:52.872 --> 07:54.897
Checkov.

07:55.007 --> 08:00.702
Well, this here's McCoy. We find
a Spock, we've got us an away team.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.985
Me in no mood for discussion.
You, you stay.

08:06.085 --> 08:08.815
The rest of you, go now.

08:08.921 --> 08:13.936
Why don't you make like a tree
and get the fuck out of here!

08:17.296 --> 08:19.258
You know he's got
till the week's end, right?

08:19.298 --> 08:21.727
<i>You don't have to be hard-asses,
do ya?</i>

08:21.767 --> 08:24.092
It's St Patty's Day.
Everyone's Irish tonight.

08:24.132 --> 08:24.404
Mmm.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.799
Why don't you just pull up a stool
and have a drink with us?

08:26.839 --> 08:29.342
This is no game! If you won't go…

08:29.442 --> 08:32.035
we will make you go.

08:49.662 --> 08:52.892
So these two guys are kickin'
the shit out of each other, right?

08:52.932 --> 08:55.862
<i>This guy picks up
an old kitchen sink or something…</i>

08:55.902 --> 08:58.231
<i>and fuckin' crushes this guy with it.</i>

08:58.271 --> 09:01.399
<i>It makes a big bang.</i>

09:24.897 --> 09:28.194
Look at him. His spine's all crushed.
Had to be one big motherfucker.

09:28.234 --> 09:32.227
<i>Huge. Three, four hundred pounds.
Fuckin' huge.</i>

09:32.338 --> 09:35.143
–That's pretty thin.
–Very thin.

09:40.112 --> 09:42.444
<i>Okay.
All right, all right.</i>

09:42.548 --> 09:45.144
<i>Say these two guys right here, they don't
even know the fuckin' huge guy.</i>

09:45.184 --> 09:46.849
They're just staggering
home from a bar still…

09:46.889 --> 09:48.347
all fucked up from St Patty's last night.

09:48.387 --> 09:51.083
They decide to take a shortcut
down through the alley.

09:51.123 --> 09:53.318
Wrong fuckin' alley, huh?

09:53.426 --> 09:55.755
'Cause this big motherfucker,
he's just waitin' for 'em, right?

09:55.795 --> 09:58.149
And what could be more perfect
for a strong-arm robbery?

09:58.189 --> 09:59.559
Two drunk guys all bandaged up.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.128
<i>They're already injured,
for Christ's sakes. Look at 'em.</i>

10:02.168 --> 10:05.538
<i>These guys are stumblin'
through the alley.</i>

10:05.638 --> 10:08.034
This guy takes a blunt object,
fuckin'-waah!

10:08.074 --> 10:11.404
Hits the guy with the bandages around
his head, right? Why? 'Cause he's smart.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.707
<i>He knows the guy with the bandage
around his ass, he ain't goin' nowhere.</i>

10:14.747 --> 10:17.341
<i>He's goin' fuckin' nowhere!</i>

10:17.450 --> 10:21.020
Where are you goin'?
Nowhere! That's right.

10:22.888 --> 10:25.484
He ain't done yet. He comes over
and jumps on this guy's back…

10:25.524 --> 10:27.649
and crushes him to death.

10:29.061 --> 10:31.264
I feel something big here.

10:31.364 --> 10:33.593
I wouldn't be surprised to see
a lot of these turnin' up.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.535
<i>Brilliant!</i>

10:35.635 --> 10:38.729
So now we got a huge guy theory…

10:38.838 --> 10:41.272
and a serial crusher theory.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.433
Top notch.

10:43.542 --> 10:45.838
–What's your name?
–Detective Greenly.

10:45.878 --> 10:50.049
–Who the fuck are you?
–That's who the fuck I am.

10:50.149 --> 10:53.516
<i>Listen, I gotta do this
by the numbers.</i>

10:53.619 --> 10:56.389
I.D just came back on these guys.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.684
They got connections
with the Russian mob.

10:58.724 --> 11:01.488
<i>That makes it a federal matter.</i>

11:01.594 --> 11:06.125
<i>And Agent Smecker here is heading up
the investigation with our full cooperation.</i>

11:06.165 --> 11:09.428
–Why don't you get me a cup of coffee?
–Who the hell is this?

11:09.468 --> 11:11.564
–A café latte, twist of lemon…
–What the fuck-…

11:11.604 --> 11:15.514
–Chief, what the fuck is this?
–Sweet 'N Low.

13:32.278 --> 13:34.303
Mitchell, Langley!

13:34.413 --> 13:37.476
<i>–Yes, sir.
–Find the manager of this building.</i>

13:37.516 --> 13:40.479
See if he's had any complaints
of water coming down…

13:40.519 --> 13:42.748
in any of the apartments
starting just this morning.

13:42.788 --> 13:46.443
Langley, you take that building.
Same thing.

13:46.725 --> 13:49.091
Chaffey! Newman!

13:49.195 --> 13:52.424
<i>–Yes, sir.
–Look in the trash around their hands.</i>

13:52.464 --> 13:55.367
See if you can find me two bullet casings…

13:55.467 --> 13:58.867
fifty-caliber if my eyes serve me right.

13:59.038 --> 14:02.337
Newman, rip through this shit.

14:02.441 --> 14:04.807
If this was a sink…

14:04.910 --> 14:06.812
find me some metal parts.

14:06.912 --> 14:10.482
Give me a drain cover,
faucet or something.

14:12.651 --> 14:14.647
Got it right here.
It's a 50-cal.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.656
Chief, can you get ballistics down here…

14:17.756 --> 14:20.486
and tell 'em they have to dig
a 50-caliber slug…

14:20.526 --> 14:23.455
out of a brick wall and locate another
that's been fired through a Dumpster?

14:23.495 --> 14:25.457
We have the best
ballistics guy in the world.

14:25.497 --> 14:28.227
–I can have him here in ten minutes.
–How did you know that?

14:28.267 --> 14:30.267
Liquid paraffin.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.633
Came up positive.

14:32.738 --> 14:35.100
And bullet holes are usually a big clue.

14:35.140 --> 14:37.376
Nobody reported any gunshots.

14:37.476 --> 14:40.973
This is an Irish neighborhood.
I'm surprised you even got a phone call.

14:41.013 --> 14:43.809
<i>You know, I can't find
the second one, sir.</i>

14:43.849 --> 14:45.849
Look under the body.

14:49.021 --> 14:51.353
Oh, yeah, there it is.

14:53.525 --> 14:55.686
You guys ready for this?

14:55.794 --> 14:59.025
This was no gangland assassination.

14:59.131 --> 15:01.734
Though creative,
it was way too sloppy.

15:01.834 --> 15:05.197
Something went wrong here.
This has “personal” written all over it.

15:05.237 --> 15:08.601
<i>Agent Smecker.
Yeah, this is all illegal loft housing.</i>

15:08.641 --> 15:11.470
There's no manager on the premises,
but they found a lady on the fourth floor…

15:11.510 --> 15:13.739
who said she had water dripping
down on her whole place.

15:13.779 --> 15:16.008
–It started just this morning.
–Fourth floor, huh?

15:16.048 --> 15:18.048
Mm-hmm.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.387
Then we're headin' to the fifth.

15:21.487 --> 15:24.316
<i>Come on. Let's get out of here.
You're reachin', man.</i>

15:24.356 --> 15:26.864
–It's a theory.
–I don't know. No way.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.855
You know how big a guy's
gotta be to do that? Fuckin' huge.

15:29.895 --> 15:34.825
Oh, really? I might just be
wantin' a bagel with my coffee.

15:40.873 --> 15:44.018
I ain't gettin' him no fuckin' bagel.

15:51.917 --> 15:55.062
<i>We'll start the ass kissing with you.</i>

15:58.590 --> 16:00.990
<i>Agent Smecker. Agent-</i>

16:01.093 --> 16:02.988
Listen, I know this neighborhood
pretty good.

16:03.028 --> 16:04.990
There's a bar down the block
named McGinty's.

16:05.030 --> 16:06.925
It stands a good chance
they were there last night.

16:06.965 --> 16:07.726
Good work, Mitchell.

16:07.766 --> 16:10.291
I'll check it out myself.

16:10.402 --> 16:13.198
<i>Look at the ceiling.
Sense of touch alone.</i>

16:13.238 --> 16:15.334
Wait until you feel me move.
Ooh.

16:15.374 --> 16:18.070
So quick you couldn't
even feel it go, could you?

16:18.110 --> 16:21.173
<i>Let's try it again.
Try it again. Look at the ceiling.</i>

16:21.213 --> 16:23.213
It's Doc.

16:25.484 --> 16:29.113
–Thanks for comin', Doc.
–Jesus Christ!

16:29.221 --> 16:32.618
What the fuck happened?
Are-Are you b-b-boys all right?

16:32.658 --> 16:36.028
–We're alive.
–An F.B.I agent came by the bar…

16:36.128 --> 16:38.030
and he left me his c-c-ca—

16:38.130 --> 16:41.627
He left me his c-c—
Oh, he fuckin' gave me this. Fuck!

16:41.667 --> 16:43.969
<i>Ass! What are you gonna do?</i>

16:44.069 --> 16:46.598
We oughta turn ourselves in,
tell him it was self-defense.

16:46.638 --> 16:48.534
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's what he said.

16:48.574 --> 16:50.349
How the fuck's he know that?
We haven't spoken to anyone.

16:50.389 --> 16:53.503
–D-D-Don't know.
–He d-d-didn't say.

16:53.612 --> 16:56.208
All right. Listen, Doc,
we need you to do us a favor.

16:56.248 --> 16:58.911
–A-A-Anything.
–Just hold on to this for us.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.825
We're gonna come back
for it when we get out.

17:00.865 --> 17:03.153
Right.
Fuck! Ass!

17:05.257 --> 17:10.186
None of that cursing was directed at you.
He's— He's a bit—

17:12.964 --> 17:14.867
First of all…

17:14.967 --> 17:18.037
I'd like to thank whichever one of you…

17:18.137 --> 17:21.265
doughnut-munching,
barrel-assed…

17:21.373 --> 17:25.198
pud-pulling sissies
leaked this to the press.

17:26.345 --> 17:28.325
That's just what we need now-…

17:28.380 --> 17:30.442
some sensational story in the papers…

17:30.482 --> 17:35.421
making these boys out to be
superheroes triumphing over evil.

17:35.521 --> 17:38.354
Let me squash the rumors now.

17:38.457 --> 17:41.051
These two are not heroes.

17:42.828 --> 17:45.130
They're just two ordinary men…

17:45.230 --> 17:48.934
who were put in
an extraordinary situation…

17:49.034 --> 17:51.430
and they just happened to come out on top.

17:51.470 --> 17:55.407
Yes, nothing from our
far-reaching computer system…

17:55.507 --> 17:57.469
has turned up diddly on these two.

17:57.509 --> 17:59.938
All we know is what
we found out from the neighbors.

17:59.978 --> 18:02.613
And the general consensus is…

18:04.650 --> 18:06.650
they're angels.

18:09.354 --> 18:12.084
But angels don't kill.

18:12.191 --> 18:14.827
And we got two bodies in the morgue…

18:14.927 --> 18:17.322
that look like they've been serial-crushed…

18:17.362 --> 18:21.059
by some huge, friggin' guy.

18:21.166 --> 18:24.163
<i>Are we considering these guys
armed and dangerous?</i>

18:24.203 --> 18:26.138
Well, not armed.

18:26.238 --> 18:29.835
If they had guns, they would've used them.
But dangerous? Very.

18:29.875 --> 18:31.837
<i>Now, what makes you think
they're dangerous?</i>

18:31.877 --> 18:35.362
Maybe they're just protectin' each other.

18:39.051 --> 18:42.521
Hey, look, I-I-I'm not sayin'
one way or the other.

18:42.621 --> 18:46.682
Just be careful and go
by the protocol on this.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.189
It's grunt police work
that's gonna bring this one in.

18:50.229 --> 18:52.965
These guys are miles away by now.

18:53.065 --> 18:56.361
<i>But if you wanna beat your head against
the wall, then here's what
you're lookin' for.</i>

18:56.401 --> 18:58.730
<i>They're scared, like two
little bunny rabbits.</i>

18:58.770 --> 19:00.600
Anything in a uniform or
flashing blue lights…

19:00.640 --> 19:01.700
is gonna spook 'em.

19:01.740 --> 19:05.771
<i>Okay? So the only thing we can do
is put a potato on a string…</i>

19:05.811 --> 19:07.773
<i>and drag it through South Boston.</i>

19:07.813 --> 19:10.338
Thanks for comin' out.

19:10.449 --> 19:14.104
You'd probably have
better luck with a beer.

19:14.553 --> 19:16.288
You would.

19:16.388 --> 19:19.221
<i>–Oh, fuck.
–Hey, Greenly.</i>

19:19.324 --> 19:22.350
<i>Onion bagel, cream cheese.</i>

19:34.673 --> 19:38.666
This conversation is going to be recorded.

19:38.777 --> 19:41.073
Just answer to the best of your knowledge.

19:41.113 --> 19:43.547
Excuse me, sir.
Please.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.728
<i>Okay, we're ready.</i>

19:59.331 --> 20:03.095
You boys are not under oath here.
Just answer the questions.

20:03.135 --> 20:05.365
I'm assuming…

20:05.470 --> 20:08.615
you knew these guys from before, huh?

20:10.809 --> 20:14.108
We met them last night.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.015
They had some
pretty interesting bandages.

20:17.115 --> 20:19.240
Know anything about that?

20:22.688 --> 20:25.150
Listen, if you want to fight,
you can see you're outnumbered here.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.186
We're trying to be civil,
so I suggest you take our offer.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.456
I make the offers.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.586
Hey, Boris.

20:33.799 --> 20:35.994
What would you do…

20:36.101 --> 20:38.194
if I told you…

20:38.303 --> 20:41.240
your pinko Commie mother
sucks so much dick…

20:41.340 --> 20:43.865
<i>her face looks like an egg?</i>

20:43.976 --> 20:46.696
–Fuck you!
–What are you doin'?

21:13.338 --> 21:16.568
Stay away!
He can take care of himself!

21:43.068 --> 21:45.804
Freeze,
you fuckin' Irish faggots!

21:45.904 --> 21:48.805
Get the fuck up!

21:48.907 --> 21:52.444
–Come on!
–Get your fuckin' hands off of me!

21:52.544 --> 21:55.747
Cuff yourself around the back!
Cuff yourself!

21:55.847 --> 21:58.338
Cuff it!

22:00.719 --> 22:03.255
You know why I fucking come here?

22:03.355 --> 22:05.619
I come here to kill you.

22:05.724 --> 22:09.854
But now, I no think I fucking kill you.

22:09.961 --> 22:11.863
I kill your brother.

22:11.963 --> 22:13.963
<i>Shoot him in the head.</i>

22:15.567 --> 22:17.567
–Fuck you!
–Gotta go.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.967
Conner!

22:20.072 --> 22:25.257
It was just a fuckin' bar fight!
You guys are fuckin' pussies!

23:17.562 --> 23:21.132
I hope your conscience is clear, Irishman.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.963
So, how is it…

24:36.074 --> 24:39.905
that you guys are fluent in Russian?
–We paid attention in school.

24:39.945 --> 24:42.180
Do you speak any other languages?

24:42.280 --> 24:45.850
–Aye. Our mother insisted on it.
–French?

24:49.654 --> 24:51.654
Oh, that's beautiful.

24:55.660 --> 24:58.720
–What's that?
–It's Italian.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.171
<i>Jawohl.</i>

25:12.010 --> 25:17.015
What are you guys doin' workin'
at a friggin' meat packing plant?

25:17.115 --> 25:18.478
<i>–Uh, Agent Smecker?
The press is everywhere.</i>

25:18.518 --> 25:19.518
Yeah.

25:19.618 --> 25:23.715
They're just goin' nuts for these guys.
I don't know what you wanna do.

25:23.755 --> 25:26.485
You're not being charged.
It's up to you. You wanna talk to 'em?

25:26.525 --> 25:28.967
–Absolutely not.
–No pictures either.

25:29.027 --> 25:31.389
Is there any way that we could stay here?

25:31.429 --> 25:35.460
Uh, yeah. You know, we have
an extra holding cell you guys can-…

25:35.500 --> 25:38.214
<i>–Can they stay?
–Well, we'll have…</i>

25:38.314 --> 25:40.345
<i>to check with your mom.</i>

25:40.605 --> 25:44.685
But it's okay with me
if your friends sleep over.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.771
Time to feed the dogs.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.814
Okay, people. Okay.

25:53.919 --> 25:56.888
This is our official statement.

25:56.988 --> 26:00.759
The MacManus brothers
are not being charged with a crime.

26:00.859 --> 26:03.455
<i>This is a clear-cut case
of self-defense.</i>

26:03.495 --> 26:05.924
They are being released
at an undisclosed time and location…

26:05.964 --> 26:07.926
in accordance with their wishes.

26:07.966 --> 26:11.673
Do the MacManus
brothers have any priors?

26:11.773 --> 26:14.256
Can we speak to the brothers?

26:17.876 --> 26:20.766
<i>–Hey, Rocco, how you doin'?
–Hey!</i>

26:21.913 --> 26:24.507
Yeah!

26:29.220 --> 26:31.122
What have you got there?

26:31.222 --> 26:33.952
–Ahh.
–Very nice.

26:37.529 --> 26:39.431
<i>This poor soul…</i>

26:39.531 --> 26:41.433
<i>cried out for help.</i>

26:41.533 --> 26:44.832
<i>They watched
as he simply walked away.</i>

26:44.936 --> 26:47.632
<i>Indifference of good men!</i>

26:47.739 --> 26:50.640
<i>Nobody wanted to get involved.</i>

26:50.742 --> 26:52.277
<i>Nobody-…</i>

26:52.377 --> 26:55.608
<i>Whosoever shed man's blood…</i>

26:55.714 --> 26:59.514
<i>by man shall his blood be shed.</i>

26:59.618 --> 27:04.055
<i>For in the image of God
may deem a man.</i>

27:04.155 --> 27:06.151
Destroy all that which is evil.

27:06.191 --> 27:09.166
So that which is good may flourish.

27:43.595 --> 27:45.595
What the fuck is that?

27:47.432 --> 27:50.322
<i>It's that fuckin' Russian's pager.</i>

27:51.536 --> 27:53.536
Let's go.

28:04.749 --> 28:06.910
How are ya?

28:07.018 --> 28:09.414
–Keep the faith, man.
–Fuckin' blow me.

28:09.454 --> 28:12.984
–What was that? Have you got a pen?
–Yeah. Here you go.

28:13.024 --> 28:15.253
–Thanks. Be right back.
–Good morning, son. How are ya?

28:15.293 --> 28:19.883
–Good morning.
–We'd be honored if you would join us.

28:21.466 --> 28:24.697
–See this?
–What's this?

28:24.803 --> 28:26.803
Saints?

28:31.509 --> 28:34.059
Body of Christ.
Body of Christ.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.396
Amen.

28:58.203 --> 29:01.266
That's not funny, man.
Give it here, package boy.

29:01.306 --> 29:04.436
Joey Beevo said it was important.
Said to give it to him myself.

29:04.476 --> 29:07.309
Give me the fuckin' thing.

29:09.214 --> 29:11.409
Sit the fuck down.

29:22.927 --> 29:26.055
So, I'm Rocco.
I'm the funny man.

29:29.167 --> 29:31.069
I'm so fuckin' funny.

29:31.169 --> 29:33.933
–Fuck you, Vincenzo.
–Uh-huh.

29:34.038 --> 29:36.468
How did you get that shiner on your eye?

29:36.508 --> 29:41.523
What's the matter, someone
didn't think you were very funny?

29:43.081 --> 29:45.043
<i>I caught your show at
the Velvet Room at the Holiday Inn.</i>

29:45.083 --> 29:47.979
Loved it when you busted into
“Viva Las Vegas.”

29:48.019 --> 29:50.647
Hey, hey, hey.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.827
You insignificant little fuck!

29:58.930 --> 30:03.026
<i>I always get my money,
you cocksucking bastardo!</i>

30:09.707 --> 30:11.669
<i>The '90s are killing me.</i>

30:11.709 --> 30:13.611
I shouldn't have done that.

30:13.711 --> 30:16.274
You're not supposed to tell a guy
you're gonna kill him no more.

30:16.314 --> 30:19.677
<i>I gotta tiptoe through the tulips
with these assholes.</i>

30:19.717 --> 30:23.050
Taking all the fun out of the job.

30:29.060 --> 30:31.780
Pappa Joe,
you want me to go now?

30:33.665 --> 30:36.861
All the boys tell me how you
make them laugh when you come around.

30:36.901 --> 30:39.798
What a crackup you are.
What do they call you?

30:39.838 --> 30:41.931
Uh, the—

30:42.040 --> 30:44.508
The-The funny man.

30:44.609 --> 30:46.511
<i>The funny man.</i>

30:46.611 --> 30:50.012
I'm having a shitty day.
I'm depressed.

30:50.114 --> 30:52.912
Tell me a funny joke.

30:53.017 --> 30:55.508
Now?

30:55.620 --> 30:57.589
A joke? Uh—

30:57.689 --> 31:00.118
<i>Um, uh, a joke.
Yeah, all right.</i>

31:00.158 --> 31:03.685
Um, there's these, uh,
three guys-…

31:03.795 --> 31:05.990
a-a-a spic…

31:06.097 --> 31:09.032
a-a-a white guy and a black guy.

31:09.133 --> 31:11.658
–Nigger!
–Yeah.

31:11.769 --> 31:14.165
N-N-Yeah.
And they're walkin' along the beach.

31:14.205 --> 31:17.068
They see this pot.
They rub it, a genie comes out.

31:17.108 --> 31:19.977
<i>Genie says you can wish
for anything you want.</i>

31:20.017 --> 31:22.140
<i>He asks the Mexican what he wants.</i>

31:22.180 --> 31:24.082
And he goes…

31:24.182 --> 31:29.087
“I want all my people in America
to be happy and free in Mexico.”

31:29.187 --> 31:33.590
So the genie— Poof!
And all the spics are in Mexico.

31:33.691 --> 31:36.154
–And then he asks the black guy—
–Nigger.

31:36.194 --> 31:38.560
Yeah, that's what I said.

31:38.663 --> 31:41.426
He goes to the nigger,
says, “What do you want?”

31:41.466 --> 31:43.368
And he goes…

31:43.468 --> 31:46.301
“I want all my African—…

31:46.404 --> 31:48.233
”my nigger brothers in America…

31:48.273 --> 31:52.266
to be back in Africa
and happy and everything.”

31:52.377 --> 31:54.436
So the genie goes poof!

31:54.545 --> 31:57.141
<i>And, um, all the niggers in America…</i>

31:57.181 --> 31:59.775
<i>are in Africa.</i>

31:59.884 --> 32:02.213
And this is goin'— I'm not funny today.

32:02.253 --> 32:05.216
I know. I'm havin' a hard day.
I-I-This joke sucks.

32:05.256 --> 32:07.622
<i>It's just a stupid joke.</i>

32:11.796 --> 32:13.796
Continue the joke.

32:18.236 --> 32:21.372
So the genie says to the white guy…

32:21.472 --> 32:23.565
“What's your one wish?”

32:23.675 --> 32:25.770
And the white guy goes,
“You mean to tell me…

32:25.810 --> 32:28.072
all the niggers and spics
are out of America?”

32:28.112 --> 32:30.224
The genie goes, “Yeah.” He says…

32:30.248 --> 32:33.138
“Well, um, I'll have a Coke then.”

32:55.039 --> 32:56.941
“I'll have a Coke.”

32:57.041 --> 32:59.271
Yeah. Everybody's out…

32:59.377 --> 33:03.712
so he just wants a Coke,
'cause that's all he needs.

33:06.317 --> 33:09.718
–Tell me one more.
–What?

33:28.139 --> 33:30.139
Knock yourselves out.

33:54.198 --> 33:56.198
Fuckin' hell.

34:11.081 --> 34:13.545
Do you know what we
need, man? Some rope.

34:13.585 --> 34:14.645
<i>Absolutely.</i>

34:14.685 --> 34:17.621
<i>–What are ya, insane?
–No, it ain't.</i>

34:17.722 --> 34:19.966
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.

34:20.024 --> 34:22.583
<i>–What?
–Yeah.</i>

34:22.693 --> 34:24.025
He's got a lot of rope strapped around him…

34:24.065 --> 34:25.456
in the movies, and they
always end up using it.

34:25.496 --> 34:29.333
<i>–You've lost it, haven't it?
–No, I'm serious.</i>

34:29.434 --> 34:32.330
That's stupid. Name one thing
you'd need a rope for.

34:32.370 --> 34:36.333
You don't fuckin' know what you're gonna
need it for. They just always need it.

34:36.373 --> 34:40.029
What's this “they” shit?
This isn't a movie.

34:43.313 --> 34:45.440
<i>Oh. Right.</i>

34:51.589 --> 34:53.589
Is that right, Rambo?

34:57.495 --> 35:00.896
All right.
Get your stupid fuckin' rope.

35:00.998 --> 35:03.466
I'll get my stupid rope.

35:03.568 --> 35:05.568
I'll get it.

35:06.838 --> 35:08.963
There's rope right there.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.141
You nervous?

35:46.377 --> 35:49.608
–A bit.
–Myself as well.

36:02.093 --> 36:04.093
Hello?

36:06.931 --> 36:08.931
Uh-huh. Room number?

36:10.268 --> 36:12.648
Have we got a time of death?

36:15.106 --> 36:17.106
We got a body count?

36:19.944 --> 36:22.713
Uh-huh. I'll be down there in a bit.

36:22.813 --> 36:25.941
Keep the press out.

36:26.050 --> 36:28.913
–What are you doin'?
–I just wanted to cuddle.

36:28.953 --> 36:31.547
Cuddle?
What a fag.

36:42.767 --> 36:44.669
Ooh.

36:44.769 --> 36:47.574
<i>This is a fucking slaughterhouse.</i>

36:56.214 --> 37:00.116
–How many bodies, Greenly?
–Eight.

37:00.218 --> 37:03.554
Aw, shit. I forgot about that one.
Nine. Nine?

37:03.654 --> 37:06.651
While Greenly's out gettin' coffee,
anybody else want anything?

37:06.691 --> 37:09.285
Shit!

37:09.393 --> 37:11.588
<i>So, Duffy…</i>

37:11.696 --> 37:15.530
you got any theories to go with that tie?

37:17.201 --> 37:20.864
Look, fuck all these other guys.

37:20.972 --> 37:23.307
This was their target; the fag man.

37:23.407 --> 37:25.807
The what man?

37:25.910 --> 37:29.038
The fat man.

37:29.146 --> 37:31.307
Well, Freud was right.

37:31.415 --> 37:35.317
So you think they came
for the fag man, huh?

37:35.419 --> 37:37.887
<i>What do you base this upon?</i>

37:37.989 --> 37:40.718
He was the only one done right.
Double tap back of the head.

37:40.758 --> 37:43.354
<i>–And the pennies?
–New hit man wants to leave his mark.</i>

37:43.394 --> 37:45.329
That's a possibility.

37:45.429 --> 37:49.388
<i>Now you Irish cops are perkin' up.</i>

37:49.500 --> 37:51.462
That's two sound theories in one day…

37:51.502 --> 37:54.498
neither of which deal
with abnormally-sized men.

37:54.538 --> 37:57.938
Kind of makes me feel like Riverdancing.

38:01.746 --> 38:05.843
<i>Another possibility is they were
placed there with religious intent.</i>

38:05.883 --> 38:09.914
<i>Okay, some cultures still put pennies
in the eyes of the dead. Or silver.</i>

38:09.954 --> 38:12.422
The Italians, the Greeks.

38:12.523 --> 38:14.957
<i>Sicilians.</i>

38:15.059 --> 38:18.085
So, what's the “symbology” there?

38:18.195 --> 38:20.925
The “symbology”?

38:21.032 --> 38:24.428
Now that Duffy has relinquished
his King Bonehead crown…

38:24.468 --> 38:26.430
I see we have an heir to the thrown.

38:26.470 --> 38:32.003
<i>I'm sure the word you were looking for was
“symbolism.” What is the symbolism there.</i>

38:32.043 --> 38:34.807
Let me explain it to you.

38:34.912 --> 38:37.148
In Greek and Roman mythology…

38:37.248 --> 38:40.985
when you died, you'd have
to pay the toll to Charon…

38:41.085 --> 38:44.548
the boatman who ferried you
across to the Gates of Judgment.

38:44.588 --> 38:47.285
This made sure the dead came to
atone for what they did during their lives…

38:47.325 --> 38:49.227
Detective Alapopskalius.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.656
Jesus. You're the first one
that ever got that.

38:51.696 --> 38:55.655
Yeah, well, I'm an expert in nameology.

38:59.637 --> 39:03.462
These burns indicate
that they used silencers.

39:03.741 --> 39:06.577
Look at these entry and exit wounds.

39:06.677 --> 39:08.802
They're almost identical.

39:10.314 --> 39:13.544
The two bullets went in here
through the top of the skull…

39:13.584 --> 39:16.480
crisscrossed, and exited
through the eyeballs.

39:16.520 --> 39:19.424
This one clue tells us three distinct facts.

39:19.457 --> 39:22.720
–Number one. Duffy?
–They shot him at a downward angle.

39:22.760 --> 39:27.993
–They put him on his knees?
–Excellent. Number two. Greenly.

39:28.099 --> 39:31.330
They shot him at a downward angle?

39:35.339 --> 39:38.314
It tells us he was the last to die.

39:39.510 --> 39:41.445
And number three. Dolly.

39:41.545 --> 39:43.447
There was two shooters.

39:43.547 --> 39:46.243
–Fan-freakin'-tastic.
–Hey, wait a minute.

39:46.283 --> 39:48.786
Stay with me, boys.
What did they do…

39:48.886 --> 39:50.848
to make two such identical wounds?

39:50.888 --> 39:53.951
Two men of similar height
dropped this guy down.

39:53.991 --> 39:58.422
Each puts some iron to his head
and boom! That's all she frickin' wrote.

39:58.462 --> 40:01.465
–What about one guy, two guns?
–Ah, possible.

40:01.565 --> 40:04.228
But unlikely.
The angles are too extreme.

40:04.268 --> 40:05.864
A guy holding two guns to the back of…

40:05.904 --> 40:07.698
your noodle is going to
shoot straight ahead.

40:07.738 --> 40:09.700
He wouldn't cock out his elbows.
It makes no sense.

40:09.740 --> 40:14.006
Besides, are you telling me
one guy came in here…

40:14.111 --> 40:18.109
and killed eight men with eight extremely
well-aimed shots in just a few seconds?

40:18.149 --> 40:20.954
No way.
It had to be at least two.

40:25.589 --> 40:27.799
You and your fuckin' rope.

40:39.270 --> 40:44.540
–I told you there would be a shaft.
–Just like on television.

41:06.530 --> 41:08.530
Fuck.

41:35.292 --> 41:37.760
Where the fuck are you goin'?

41:37.862 --> 41:40.631
Shh! I fuckin' hear some shit out here.

41:40.731 --> 41:44.628
Fuck you. I'm sweatin' my ass off
draggin' your fuckin' rope around.

41:44.668 --> 41:46.837
–It must weigh 30 pounds.
–Shh!

41:46.937 --> 41:49.867
We are doin' some serious shit here.
Now, get a fuckin' hold of yourself!

41:49.907 --> 41:53.170
Oh, fuck you! I'm not the rope-totin'
Charlie Bronson wannabe…

41:53.210 --> 41:58.395
that's gettin' us fuckin' lost.
–Would you fuckin' shut it?

41:58.516 --> 42:00.516
You mother-…

42:11.595 --> 42:15.759
–Jesus fuckin' Christ.
–Oh, shit!

42:43.460 --> 42:46.590
Shepherds we shall be
for Thee, my Lord, for Thee.

42:46.630 --> 42:48.792
Power hath descended forth
from Thy hand.

42:48.832 --> 42:51.328
Our feet may swiftly
carry out Thy command.

42:51.368 --> 42:58.083
So we shall flow a river forth to Thee,
and teeming with souls shall it ever be.

43:35.613 --> 43:39.947
<i>And I shall count thee
among my favored sheep.</i>

43:40.050 --> 43:45.235
<i>And you shall have the protection
of all the angels in heaven.</i>

43:46.824 --> 43:48.824
Television.

43:50.761 --> 43:53.023
Television is the explanation for this.

43:53.063 --> 43:56.829
You see this in bad television.

43:56.934 --> 44:00.397
The little assault guys creepin' through
the vents, comin' in through the ceiling.

44:00.437 --> 44:06.143
That James Bond shit never happens
in real life. Professionals don't do that.

44:06.243 --> 44:11.515
Well, name one thing you're gonna need
this stupid fuckin' rope for.

44:11.615 --> 44:14.485
–That was way easier than I thought.
–Aye.

44:14.585 --> 44:17.147
On TV, you've always got that guy
that jumps over the sofa.

44:17.187 --> 44:20.517
And then you've gotta shoot him
for ten fuckin' minutes too.

44:20.557 --> 44:24.823
–Christ. We're good.
–Yes, we are.

44:24.928 --> 44:29.263
Now, what do you think
is in that little case there?

44:34.938 --> 44:37.998
–Fuck me!
–Oh.

44:38.108 --> 44:40.177
The hits just keep on comin'.

44:40.277 --> 44:42.541
Ow! Give it a smell.

44:42.646 --> 44:45.012
I love our new job.

45:02.966 --> 45:05.929
<i>Bastard.
This has got to be his big break.</i>

45:05.969 --> 45:11.339
–Yeah.
–We've got to fuck with him, right?

45:11.442 --> 45:13.344
Okay.

45:13.444 --> 45:15.346
Shh.

45:15.446 --> 45:18.676
Open the door.
I'm gonna grab him by the fuckin' hair.

45:18.716 --> 45:21.184
Sit down!

45:21.285 --> 45:24.148
–Get down! Shut up!
–Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

45:24.188 --> 45:27.328
We're on the same side.
Please, don't shoot.

45:27.428 --> 45:28.626
Get on the ground!

45:28.726 --> 45:30.854
Don't shoot, don't shoot.
We're on the same side.

45:30.894 --> 45:33.390
Boss must've sent me
in as backup. I'm Rocco!

45:33.430 --> 45:36.326
–I'm the funny man. That ain't my name.
–Where's your gun?

45:36.366 --> 45:39.029
–Where's your gun?
–I'm the fuckin' funny man!

45:39.069 --> 45:40.497
It's right here. Right here.

45:40.537 --> 45:43.404
That ain't my real name.

45:43.507 --> 45:46.999
<i>What the fuck? Jeez!</i>

45:47.111 --> 45:49.875
It's a fuckin' six-shooter!

45:49.980 --> 45:53.347
There's nine bodies, genius!

45:53.450 --> 45:58.415
<i>What the fuck were you gonna do,
laugh the last three to death, funny man?</i>

45:58.455 --> 46:02.280
<i>Pappa Joe said there was only two!
In and out!</i>

46:03.527 --> 46:06.296
Boy, you guys sure did a good job.

46:06.396 --> 46:08.999
Ah, shit.
You guys are good, huh?

46:09.099 --> 46:11.061
Cool masks.
Where'd you get 'em?

46:11.101 --> 46:14.538
–We gotta do him right here!
–Right now!

46:14.638 --> 46:17.134
–Don't, please! I'm the funny man!
–Right.

46:17.174 --> 46:19.169
–Don't kill me! Don't kill me, please!
–Right!

46:19.209 --> 46:21.209
<i>I'm the funny man!</i>

46:29.286 --> 46:31.286
<i>What a fuckin' idiot!</i>

46:35.926 --> 46:40.192
Fuckin'-What the fuckin' fuck—
Who the fuck—

46:40.297 --> 46:45.599
<i>Fuck this fuckin'—
How did you two fuckin' fucks–Fuck!</i>

46:45.702 --> 46:50.632
Well, that certainly illustrates
the diversity of the word.

46:53.343 --> 46:56.642
All these guys are Russian mob.

46:56.747 --> 46:59.743
But not like those two peons
in the alley the other day.

46:59.783 --> 47:02.746
These guys are all syndicate
bosses and underbosses.

47:02.786 --> 47:06.441
I have a dossier on every man in this room.

47:07.124 --> 47:09.993
Since the Iron Curtain has gone down…

47:10.093 --> 47:12.856
the Russian syndicates
have started to come here.

47:12.896 --> 47:17.161
And in the spirit of Glasnost, the Soviets
have opened their borders to the Mafia.

47:17.201 --> 47:20.170
But the Italians,
they aren't convinced…

47:20.270 --> 47:23.634
the grounds in Mother Russia are
fertile enough for organized crime yet.

47:23.674 --> 47:29.012
So they ain't ready to commit.
But the Russians are coming here anyway.

47:29.112 --> 47:31.603
They are unwelcome.

47:31.715 --> 47:35.481
So, what we have here,
gentlemen…

47:35.586 --> 47:38.384
is possibly the beginning…

47:38.488 --> 47:41.463
of the first international mob war.

47:42.326 --> 47:45.362
Unless I've totally missed something.

47:45.462 --> 47:47.925
<i>I'm live from the Copley Plaza Hotel…</i>

47:47.965 --> 47:50.561
where we have just been informed
that the largest multiple murder…

47:50.601 --> 47:52.963
in Boston's history has just taken place.

47:53.003 --> 47:55.165
We have learned that
there were nine victims…

47:55.205 --> 47:58.635
all deeply involved in a notoriously
violent Russian crime syndicate…

47:58.675 --> 48:00.577
right here in Boston.

48:00.677 --> 48:03.271
<i>Anybody you think is evil?</i>

48:03.380 --> 48:05.575
Aye.

48:05.682 --> 48:09.312
Don't you think
that's a little weird, a little psycho?

48:09.353 --> 48:12.753
Do you know what I think is psycho, Roc?

48:15.626 --> 48:17.821
It's decent men with loving families.

48:17.861 --> 48:20.791
They go home every day after work,
and they turn on the news.

48:20.831 --> 48:23.493
You know what they see?
They see rapists…

48:23.533 --> 48:25.696
and murderers and child molesters.

48:25.736 --> 48:27.698
They're all gettin' out of prison.

48:27.738 --> 48:30.707
<i>Mafiosos…</i>

48:30.807 --> 48:32.976
gettin' caught with 20 kilos…

48:33.076 --> 48:36.113
gettin' out on bail the same fuckin' day.

48:36.213 --> 48:39.783
And everywhere,
everyone thinks the same thing-…

48:39.883 --> 48:43.954
that someone should just
go kill those motherfuckers.

48:44.054 --> 48:47.717
Kill 'em all.
Admit it.

48:47.824 --> 48:50.289
Even you've thought about it.

48:53.463 --> 48:56.778
You guys should be in every major city.

48:57.100 --> 48:59.146
<i>This is some heavy shit.</i>

48:59.236 --> 49:02.466
This is like “Lone Ranger” heavy, man.

49:03.106 --> 49:07.186
Fuck it! There's so much shit
that pisses me off!

49:08.745 --> 49:11.675
You guys should recruit, 'cause
I'm sick and fuckin' tired…

49:11.715 --> 49:15.078
of walkin' down the street
waitin' for one of these crack-pipin'…

49:15.118 --> 49:18.488
ass-wipin', motherless lowlifes to get me!

49:18.588 --> 49:20.783
Hallelujah, Jaffar.

49:20.891 --> 49:22.853
So you're not just talkin'
about mob guys, right?

49:22.893 --> 49:25.589
You're talkin' about pimps and drug dealers
and all that shit, right?

49:25.629 --> 49:27.629
Oh, yeah.

49:29.399 --> 49:32.669
Fuck. You guys could
do this every goddamn day.

49:32.769 --> 49:35.465
We're sort of like 7-Eleven.

49:35.572 --> 49:39.102
We're not always doin' business,
but we're always open.

49:39.142 --> 49:43.222
–Mmm. That is nicely put.
–Thank you very much.

49:52.622 --> 49:54.747
I will fuck you up, dude.

50:01.698 --> 50:06.543
So then we go right through
the fuckin' ceiling like this—

50:13.210 --> 50:18.512
Oh, boy. You fuckin' guys.
You ruined me.

50:18.615 --> 50:21.277
I'm fuckin' done.

50:21.385 --> 50:24.479
Permanent fuckin' package boy.

50:24.588 --> 50:28.592
Who said that?
You can take credit on that, you know?

50:28.692 --> 50:30.990
What, are you serious?

50:31.094 --> 50:33.094
Yeah. Fuck it.

50:34.698 --> 50:37.461
If you think about it,
it's all you can do, really.

50:37.501 --> 50:39.596
<i>I mean, you can't go in there
and tell him it was us.</i>

50:39.636 --> 50:41.665
<i>Climb the corporate ladder, boy.</i>

50:41.705 --> 50:44.674
Don Rocco.

50:44.775 --> 50:47.005
Fuck it.

50:47.110 --> 50:49.012
I'm doin' it. I deserve it.

50:49.112 --> 50:52.175
I've been workin' for those fat bastards
since I've been in high school.

50:52.215 --> 50:55.345
Look at this fuckin' place.
They're fuckin' me, man.

50:55.385 --> 50:59.549
They can suck my pathetic little dick!

50:59.656 --> 51:02.230
And I'll dip my nuts in marinara sauce…

51:02.259 --> 51:04.988
just so the fat bastards can get
a taste of home while they're at it.

51:05.028 --> 51:08.395
<i>Fuck it!
I'm doin' it.</i>

51:08.498 --> 51:11.194
It is done!
Shit!

51:11.301 --> 51:14.566
–Shit! Shit!
–Oh, my God!

51:17.774 --> 51:19.810
–What the fuck!
–I'm hit!

51:19.910 --> 51:21.812
Oh, fuck!

51:21.912 --> 51:24.142
<i>What the fuck!</i>

51:26.550 --> 51:29.619
I can't believe that just fuckin' happened!

51:29.719 --> 51:31.929
–Is it dead?
–Oh, my God!

51:54.544 --> 51:56.640
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.

51:56.680 --> 51:59.205
Shit.

51:59.316 --> 52:01.685
She's on every drug known to man.

52:01.785 --> 52:06.120
She'd have sold the thing
for a dime bag. Screw her.

52:08.325 --> 52:10.754
I do kind of feel like an asshole, though.

52:10.794 --> 52:13.190
Yeah, Roc, you sound
real remorseful there.

52:13.230 --> 52:16.460
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.

52:17.868 --> 52:20.263
Listen, something's been
botherin' me about last night.

52:20.303 --> 52:23.101
<i>What?</i>

52:23.206 --> 52:26.103
What if your boss knew how many fellows
were supposed to be there?

52:26.143 --> 52:29.239
<i>–What are you— What are you sayin'?
–Think about it.</i>

52:29.279 --> 52:31.543
Nine men, six bullets.

52:31.648 --> 52:34.818
Think they sold me out?
No way. No way.

52:34.918 --> 52:37.247
Listen, he probably knew
you'd end up nailin' the fat guy…

52:37.287 --> 52:39.416
maybe one or two more, but he had
to know you weren't walkin' out of there.

52:39.456 --> 52:41.918
Figure it out.
The shooter's dead at the scene.

52:41.958 --> 52:43.920
There's no in-depth investigation.

52:43.960 --> 52:46.389
They'll just slide right off
his fuckin' back.

52:46.429 --> 52:48.331
'Cause what the fuck?

52:48.431 --> 52:51.862
As much as I love you, man,
you are not exactly Don Corleone.

52:51.902 --> 52:53.804
No, no, that—

52:53.904 --> 52:56.133
That's just not the way things are done.
Besides, how does he know…

52:56.173 --> 52:57.889
I just don't get in there,
see there's too many…

52:57.929 --> 52:59.202
of 'em, serve 'em their fuckin' food—

52:59.242 --> 53:01.271
Because he fuckin' knows you, Roc!

53:01.311 --> 53:04.741
A smooth hitter would have gone in there,
seen it was a fuckin' wash and slipped out.

53:04.781 --> 53:06.977
But you, he knows this is your only shot.

53:07.017 --> 53:10.162
You've been waitin' 18 fuckin' years.

53:10.754 --> 53:12.668
<i>No. No, no.
That-That-</i>

53:12.689 --> 53:15.752
That just ain't the way—
No, that's bull-That's bullshit.

53:15.792 --> 53:18.889
You don't know what you're talkin' about.
That's just not the way things happen.

53:18.929 --> 53:22.092
I mean, thanks for your concern and all,
but that just ain't the thing of it.

53:22.132 --> 53:24.594
Do me a favor, all right?
Just roll it around a bit on your way in.

53:24.634 --> 53:26.596
–Will you for me?
–No. No rollin'.

53:26.636 --> 53:30.003
Nothin' needs to be rolled.
Fuck!

53:30.106 --> 53:31.816
Where the fuck are you goin'?
Did you tell him?

53:31.856 --> 53:32.836
Of course I fuckin' told him.

53:32.876 --> 53:36.339
–Then what the fuck?
–You guys don't know that shit for sure!

53:36.379 --> 53:38.341
Oh, you're such a fuckin' retard!

53:38.381 --> 53:41.811
–Hey, fuck you!
–Oh, man, use your fuckin' brain for once!

53:41.851 --> 53:45.115
Is it so unbelievable that
they don't fuckin' care about ya?

53:45.155 --> 53:47.617
Oh, yeah, you two fuckin' micks
know what's goin' on, huh?

53:47.657 --> 53:50.955
<i>–Fuck you both!
–This is not a fuckin' thing you…</i>

53:50.995 --> 53:52.896
should gamble on, all right?

53:52.996 --> 53:55.098
I'm the fuck out of here.

53:55.198 --> 53:57.100
Fine! Fuck it!

53:57.200 --> 53:59.996
What kind of flowers you want
at your funeral, you dumb wop?

54:00.036 --> 54:02.365
<i>–It's the last time I'm gonna see ya!
–I'll be back at nine!</i>

54:02.405 --> 54:05.775
–Bury the fuckin' cat!
–Listen, you get in there…

54:05.875 --> 54:10.975
and you start gettin' a bad vibe,
you get the fuck out quick!

54:16.586 --> 54:18.611
Hello?

54:18.722 --> 54:21.691
–Murph.
–Hey, Roc. You okay?

54:21.791 --> 54:24.624
Anybody call for me?

54:24.728 --> 54:26.972
No, man.
Are you sure you're okay?

54:26.997 --> 54:29.192
I'm fuckin' fine.

54:29.299 --> 54:32.019
I'll catch you on the flip side.

54:39.876 --> 54:42.777
<i>Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.</i>

54:59.596 --> 55:02.659
<i>Pack your shit! Pack your shit!
We gotta get out of here!</i>

55:02.699 --> 55:05.762
–We gotta get out!
–What the fuck are you talkin' about?

55:05.802 --> 55:08.265
I killed them!
Oh, Jesus, I killed them all!

55:08.305 --> 55:10.600
–Just calm down. Tell us what happened.
–No!

55:10.640 --> 55:12.870
<i>–Rocco!
–Calm down, man.</i>

55:12.976 --> 55:16.446
Fuck you!
You start gettin' excited, motherfucker!

55:16.546 --> 55:19.014
<i>–We gotta go!
–Rocco!</i>

55:21.017 --> 55:25.777
–Well, how many were there?
–Fuckin' hurry the fuck up!

55:25.989 --> 55:28.024
All right!
I love this shit!

55:28.124 --> 55:32.055
<i>–What the fuck is wrong with you, Roc?
–The cocksucker sold me out!</i>

55:32.095 --> 55:34.291
Didn't I tell you, Roc?
Did they pull on you first?

55:34.331 --> 55:37.027
What am I doin'?
In the middle of the Lakeview!

55:37.067 --> 55:38.969
Lakeview the deli, Roc?

55:39.069 --> 55:42.432
–Looks like we got us a new fuckin' recruit.
–Rocco!

55:42.472 --> 55:46.499
–What?
–Where's my cat?

55:48.411 --> 55:51.847
I killed your cat,
you druggie bitch.

55:51.948 --> 55:53.383
–God. Why?
–What?

55:53.483 --> 55:56.212
I felt it would bring
closure to our relationship.

55:56.252 --> 55:59.187
–You killed my-my—
–Your what?

55:59.289 --> 56:00.289
My—

56:00.389 --> 56:03.593
Your fuckin' what? Huh? Your what, bitch?

56:03.693 --> 56:06.396
I'll shoot myself in the head…

56:06.496 --> 56:09.488
if you can tell me that cat's name!

56:09.599 --> 56:11.995
Go ahead! Your what?
Your precious little-…

56:12.035 --> 56:16.373
–Skippy. Skippy.
–Oh, Jesus. What color was it, bitch?

56:16.473 --> 56:18.735
Don't you fuckin'
yell at her like that, you prick!

56:18.775 --> 56:21.505
Shut your fat ass, Rayvie!

56:21.611 --> 56:26.516
I can't buy a pack of smokes without
runnin' into nine guys you fucked!

56:26.616 --> 56:30.245
Damn! Son of a bitch.

56:30.353 --> 56:32.353
<i>Let's go!</i>

56:32.455 --> 56:34.435
Let's get the fuck outta here!

56:34.524 --> 56:37.620
Those rat fucks! All of them
were all laughin' at me, man.

56:37.660 --> 56:40.090
–Are you sure you killed them, Roc?
–Fuckin'-A right I did.

56:40.130 --> 56:42.359
I had a goddamn turkey shoot over there.

56:42.399 --> 56:46.161
–Anybody call for me?
–No, man. Are you sure you're okay?

56:46.169 --> 56:48.169
I'm fuckin' fine.

56:49.939 --> 56:52.737
I'll catch you on the flip side.

57:31.014 --> 57:33.847
I'll bet it was a fuckin' test.

57:33.950 --> 57:39.560
Vincenzo came in here shootin'
his mouth off. He made sure we knew.

57:42.559 --> 57:45.265
But we did what
we were supposed to, huh?

57:45.328 --> 57:47.819
We kept our mouths shut.

57:47.931 --> 57:51.526
You? You did your part.

57:53.636 --> 57:55.538
Fuck!

57:55.638 --> 57:58.334
They know we're goodfellas now.

57:58.441 --> 58:00.421
We'll get taken care of, baby.

58:00.443 --> 58:02.536
What? Did everyone know?

58:02.645 --> 58:06.176
<i>Next thing you're gonna tell me
Sal was in on it.</i>

58:06.216 --> 58:10.820
Vincenzo told Sal first.
That fat fuck knew before we did.

58:10.920 --> 58:14.320
At least we got our funny man back, huh?

58:26.035 --> 58:28.878
That was funny, wasn't it?
That was real fucking funny!

58:28.918 --> 58:29.933
No, not me! Not me!

58:29.973 --> 58:32.874
Huh? Ha! Funny! Funny!

58:32.976 --> 58:35.911
Funny! Funny! Funny!

58:36.012 --> 58:38.071
Funny!

58:42.285 --> 58:45.948
Listen, Roc, did anybody see ya?

58:46.055 --> 58:49.686
Fuck, man, I might as well
have gone around postin' flyers.

58:49.726 --> 58:53.423
Right out in public, man.

58:53.530 --> 58:55.465
Liberating, isn't it?

58:55.565 --> 58:59.220
–Let's fucking go!
–You know, it is a bit.

59:01.704 --> 59:05.699
<i>Conner, stop the car!
Stop the fucking car, man!</i>

59:06.276 --> 59:09.472
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker,
Yakavetta's right hand!

59:09.512 --> 59:11.483
He's the one who set me up, then he went…

59:11.523 --> 59:13.676
around telling everybody
I was as good as dead.

59:13.716 --> 59:15.501
Goes there every Wednesday night 10:00,

59:15.541 --> 59:17.780
jerks off on the same
titty dancer. Never misses.

59:17.820 --> 59:21.257
–Yeah, so?
–So? So let's kill the motherfucker!

59:21.357 --> 59:24.120
I mean, what are you guys?
That's your new thing, right?

59:24.160 --> 59:26.729
–Yeah, well—
–Ah, what the fuck!

59:26.829 --> 59:29.092
I mean, who makes the cut?
Is there a raffle or something?

59:29.132 --> 59:33.096
To tell you the truth, those first ones,
they just sort of fell onto our laps.

59:33.136 --> 59:35.038
Well, what do you do?

59:35.138 --> 59:39.909
We haven't really got a system
of decidin' who, Roc. It's—

59:40.009 --> 59:42.773
Me! Me! I'm the guy!

59:42.879 --> 59:46.609
<i>I know everyone, their habits, who
they hang out with, who they talk to!</i>

59:46.649 --> 59:49.612
I got phone numbers, addresses!
I know who they're fuckin'!

59:49.652 --> 59:51.745
I know where they live!

59:51.854 --> 59:53.854
We could kill everyone.

59:55.592 --> 59:57.592
So what do you think?

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:03.220
I'm strangely comfortable with it.

01:00:15.678 --> 01:00:18.272
That's him.

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:40.495
Okay, Roc.

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:45.008
What? You guys got masks.

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:47.814
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.

01:00:47.877 --> 01:00:51.074
Fine. Fuck it!
When we're through, she can I.D me.

01:00:51.114 --> 01:00:54.510
I don't care. Just trying
to be professional, but no!

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:57.053
–It looks fine.
–No, fuck it.

01:00:57.153 --> 01:01:03.528
No, shut the fuck up! You look good.
Put it on. You look fucking scary, man.

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:09.525
Now, Roc, are you sure
that you're “O-B-kay-B”?

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:26.482
She was in here when it all went down.

01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:29.449
–Can she I.D'em?
–No.

01:01:29.552 --> 01:01:31.981
–There were wearin' masks.
–Of course they were.

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:34.350
You scream, you're dead!
Which one's he in?

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:38.995
And don't make like you don't know
who the fuck I'm talkin' about!

01:01:39.095 --> 01:01:42.865
Don't you talk to me like that,
you dirty little girl.

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:44.867
Oh, yeah. Give it to Daddy.

01:01:44.967 --> 01:01:48.494
Oh, this is one sick motherfucker.

01:01:48.604 --> 01:01:50.936
–How many?
–Three.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.954
Two of them did the shootin'.

01:01:53.042 --> 01:01:56.867
<i>“…and teeming with souls
shall it ever be.”</i>

01:01:59.315 --> 01:02:03.853
Our little theory from last night
just got shot to shit.

01:02:03.953 --> 01:02:06.588
Something new is going on here.

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:17.000
After talking to the dancer…

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:21.037
we know their mark
was the guy in the middle booth.

01:02:21.137 --> 01:02:25.132
After she watches 'em whack him,
she passes out.

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:48.931
What the fuck are you doing?

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:51.000
I'll tip her!

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:53.436
Why are there two extra victims?

01:02:53.536 --> 01:02:57.106
–Witnesses.
–No way they could have seen.

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:04.446
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen…

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:06.509
<i>to the protocol
of the porno industry…</i>

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:11.187
<i>as I'm sure you've never been
in one of these places before.</i>

01:03:11.287 --> 01:03:14.951
A man goes into the booth,
puts the money through the slot…

01:03:14.991 --> 01:03:16.986
the dancer gets it on the other side.

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:18.988
She hits the button,
the door goes up.

01:03:19.028 --> 01:03:23.426
Now there's only glass between you,
and that's “little fireman” time.

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:25.635
No way they could have seen it.

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:29.227
Those doors were down,
so that means this:

01:03:29.338 --> 01:03:31.734
They looked in,
down through the peepholes…

01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:35.712
saw these guys, opened the doors
from the inside…

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:38.274
pop, pop, pop,
right through the glass.

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:40.314
Why?

01:03:48.724 --> 01:03:51.479
–It's like a scumbag yard sale.
–We should come down here…

01:03:51.519 --> 01:03:52.922
once a week and clean house.

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:56.532
Maybe the three guys
had something in common.

01:03:56.632 --> 01:04:00.163
No, this guy's big-time.
These two are street-walkin' scum.

01:04:00.203 --> 01:04:02.999
Then that's what they had in common—
they're all bad guys.

01:04:03.039 --> 01:04:06.372
Now they're all dead bad guys.

01:04:06.475 --> 01:04:08.704
Oh, man, you gotta let me do these guys.

01:04:08.744 --> 01:04:11.140
I'm such a moron.
I gotta make up for that tit thing.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:13.644
There's no way. I've been
waitin' for this asshole.

01:04:13.684 --> 01:04:14.684
Oh, come on.

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:17.878
Come on, man.
Give the guy his shot.

01:04:17.987 --> 01:04:22.185
It's the real deal, Roc.
Evil men, dead men.

01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:26.929
Good shooting…

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:29.029
shitty shooting.

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:44.377
Plus… we got us a genuine…

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:47.784
Kennedy assassination-style
bullet theory here.

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:49.846
<i>Two guns were used.
The guy in the middle…</i>

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:52.946
was done with both of 'em.

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:55.717
<i>But this guy, he was killed…</i>

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:58.127
with bullets from gun “A” only…

01:04:58.227 --> 01:05:00.129
and this guy, gun “B” only.

01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:05.189
But ballistics dug two slugs
out of the wall from “B”…

01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:07.630
over here where the victim
was done with “A.”

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:10.560
<i>And it's the same thing over here.</i>

01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:17.575
Why the crossover?

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:20.883
That's just fuckin' weird.
I have no idea.

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:23.012
Jesus, I just can't think anymore.

01:05:23.052 --> 01:05:27.012
That scene over at the coffee shop
today just tapped me out.

01:05:27.056 --> 01:05:28.958
What scene?

01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:31.320
Some guy went nuts over off of Com Ave.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:35.491
Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop,
broad daylight, fled the scene.

01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:38.060
–Don't have much on him.
–Why wasn't I informed of this?

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.296
They weren't related.
The guy used a .38.

01:05:40.336 --> 01:05:42.999
–No pennies, totally amateur.
–Who were the victims?

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:45.829
A couple of mob peons
and a fat fuck bartender.

01:05:45.869 --> 01:05:47.203
Oh, isn't that beautiful?

01:05:47.243 --> 01:05:52.608
All the lowlifes in quiet city Boston start
droppin' dead, and you think it's unrelated!

01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:56.145
Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police
to do my thinkin' for me…

01:05:56.185 --> 01:05:58.588
I will have a fucking tag on my toe!

01:05:58.688 --> 01:06:00.850
Now get me a squad car
and get me over there!

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:05.650
I want crime scene photos
and any witness statements now!

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:25.913
Wyatt fuckin' Earp!

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:32.883
It looks like we got us a cowboy. Hmm.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:34.951
<i>“So we shall flow a river forth
to Thee…</i>

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:38.586
<i>and teeming with souls
shall it ever be.”</i>

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.829
Hey, hey, man.
You guys gotta teach me that prayer.

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:50.066
–That's some good shit, man.
–Cool it, Roc. It's a family prayer.

01:06:50.106 --> 01:06:53.041
My father's father before him.
So that's our shit.

01:06:53.081 --> 01:06:53.873
Oh, come on!

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:55.923
<i>The victims were found…</i>

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:57.907
<i>at a local adult
entertainment parlor.</i>

01:06:57.947 --> 01:07:01.043
These murders, coupled with
the three suspected mob-related killings…

01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:04.547
that occurred at this local Boston deli
earlier this afternoon…

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:07.149
brings the death toll to six,
just today.

01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:10.119
There is no doubt that all
the victims have been criminals.

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:12.521
Perhaps this explains why a public outcry…

01:07:12.561 --> 01:07:15.729
to have these crimes stopped
has not been heard.

01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:18.968
Ah, these two crime scenes are related.

01:07:19.068 --> 01:07:21.798
Too many coincidences.

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:24.148
<i>Same day, five hours apart…</i>

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.800
<i>dead mobsters in both scenes.</i>

01:07:26.909 --> 01:07:28.811
Now…

01:07:28.911 --> 01:07:31.607
why did he kill the bartender?

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:37.550
<i>Crime of passion. Just went nuts.
He shot everyone in here.</i>

01:07:37.653 --> 01:07:40.277
–Just ran out of bullets.
–Does this look like a friggin'

01:07:40.317 --> 01:07:41.250
post office to you?

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:43.252
This guy came in here with intent.

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:46.555
Maybe he didn't know exactly what he
was gonna do, but he had a good idea.

01:07:46.595 --> 01:07:48.724
<i>No, the bartender
was no fuckin' accident.</i>

01:07:48.764 --> 01:07:51.027
Well, we didn't need any help on that.

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:54.467
A lot of people saw it.
Nobody's talkin'.

01:07:55.371 --> 01:07:57.430
Figures.

01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:59.838
Oh, look.

01:07:59.942 --> 01:08:03.087
Are you guys seeing the pattern here?

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:09.278
We got big questions at both of
these crime scenes with no answers.

01:08:09.318 --> 01:08:13.456
Why did they kill the guys
in the other two booths?

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:16.184
Why did they do the bartender?

01:08:19.194 --> 01:08:21.823
Fuck!

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:25.024
I hate cold crime scenes!

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:27.174
I'm fucking leaving now.

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:32.935
And do me a favor.
Tell me when the next one dies…

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:35.950
<i>'cause these guys are not done yet.</i>

01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:03.871
Fuck you.

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:07.636
Augustus, I need your help.

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:12.417
I have a serious problem.
I am not screwing around here.

01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:17.316
I need… Il Duce.

01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:38.835
The Duke? Huh.

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:41.738
What did you do?

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:44.676
Rocco— this package boy-…

01:09:44.779 --> 01:09:46.908
he could bring down the whole East Coast.

01:09:46.948 --> 01:09:49.585
If he decides to turn state's evidence…

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:52.755
he could take us apart brick by brick.

01:09:52.854 --> 01:09:55.790
But he's happy, now…

01:09:55.891 --> 01:09:58.689
with just killing us one by one.

01:09:58.794 --> 01:10:02.958
And worse, he's good at it.

01:10:03.065 --> 01:10:07.436
Listen, kid. I hope you understand
who you're dealin' with here.

01:10:07.536 --> 01:10:10.369
This guy is no slouch.

01:10:10.472 --> 01:10:12.374
<i>When I was a boy…</i>

01:10:12.474 --> 01:10:16.445
you and papa used to speak of him
like he was a ghost.

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:19.275
Move him.

01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:25.421
<i>Your father and I used him
three times in 20 years…</i>

01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:28.922
<i>only when things got totally fucked.</i>

01:10:29.024 --> 01:10:31.954
<i>Whenever we needed
one of our own bumped off…</i>

01:10:31.994 --> 01:10:34.019
<i>we'd call this guy in.</i>

01:10:34.129 --> 01:10:36.825
<i>He had a thing
for clippin' wise guys.</i>

01:10:36.865 --> 01:10:39.129
<i>But only one rule:</i>

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:41.601
<i>No women, no kids.</i>

01:10:41.704 --> 01:10:44.433
<i>Believe me, kid,
you don't want this guy…</i>

01:10:44.473 --> 01:10:49.137
<i>unless you are 100%
sure you need him.</i>

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:52.241
<i>He's a fuckin' monster.
But only one thing.</i>

01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:55.277
He's been rottin' in the can
the last 25 or 30 years.

01:10:55.317 --> 01:11:00.417
<i>Don't even know if he's still
alive or if he’s even up to it.</i>

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:17.204
There.

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:23.716
–Well, there are ways around that.
–Yeah. Go find one.

01:11:27.583 --> 01:11:29.812
All right.
Let's talk some business here.

01:11:29.852 --> 01:11:35.632
I know a sick fuck makes the ones
we been doin' look like altar boys.

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:38.587
<i>Worst night of my life
when I met this guy.</i>

01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:41.156
<i>The guy never says
a fuckin' word to me.</i>

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:43.308
<i>We're drivin' 25 minutes…</i>

01:11:43.399 --> 01:11:47.267
<i>never a sigh,
no throat clearing, nothing.</i>

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:54.241
<i>Yeah, you're always making great
fuckin' sense, you dumb bitch.</i>

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:57.206
<i>I don't care.</i>

01:11:57.313 --> 01:12:00.874
<i>His face-blank, man.
Just nothin' there.</i>

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:03.953
<i>This guy takes out a whole family-…</i>

01:12:04.053 --> 01:12:08.728
<i>wife, kids, everyone-like
he's ordering a fucking pizza.</i>

01:12:10.125 --> 01:12:12.992
This house is clean.

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:19.314
<i>I knew if I didn't keep it together,
it was my ass.</i>

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:25.434
<i>He has a poker game
out back of his place…</i>

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:28.959
<i>with a bunch of wise guys
every Saturday.</i>

01:12:38.487 --> 01:12:41.320
Worst day of my life, man.

01:12:41.423 --> 01:12:44.517
Well, I'm sold.

01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:49.898
Don't worry, Roc.

01:12:49.998 --> 01:12:54.503
We'll do this guy right,
and you'll feel a lot better.

01:13:12.755 --> 01:13:15.383
Okay.

01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:17.491
Here's what happened.

01:13:23.098 --> 01:13:28.538
They waited in a parked car down
the street for the kid to leave.

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:32.197
There he goes.

01:13:37.179 --> 01:13:39.315
They came in through the garage.

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:44.260
The kid says he leaves it open
when he takes his bike out.

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:48.712
Now they know the wife
is the gatekeeper. She knows the code.

01:13:48.757 --> 01:13:51.220
Hit the numbers, lady. Hit the numbers.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:54.757
–I will kill you! I will kill you!
–Don't! Her hands are taped.

01:13:54.797 --> 01:13:57.226
Why do I always gotta be on bitch detail?

01:13:57.266 --> 01:14:00.629
The wife says she doesn't know
what happened after she hit the code.

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:02.227
She just remembers going down,

01:14:02.267 --> 01:14:04.600
but judging from the
burn mark on her back…

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:08.210
I think what they did
was use a stun gun on her.

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:11.707
Now this guy knows
that his friend is coming to the game…

01:14:11.747 --> 01:14:15.577
and they know that this door can
only be opened from the inside.

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:19.212
So they wait.
And when that door opens…

01:14:19.321 --> 01:14:21.321
man…

01:14:22.391 --> 01:14:24.391
nobody's ready for it.

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:33.963
Panic, devastation.

01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:38.149
This was like shootin' fish
in a friggin' barrel.

01:14:38.574 --> 01:14:40.701
All of 'em.

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:07.362
<i>Now these guys dove under the table.</i>

01:15:07.402 --> 01:15:11.467
<i>The trajectory on the bullet showed that
they came from straight across.</i>

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:16.097
<i>So that means one of our
shooters dropped to his knees.</i>

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:42.571
–Something went wrong right here.
–Shit! Shit! He ain't here!

01:15:42.671 --> 01:15:45.400
<i>Oh, what the fuck you mean,
he isn't here?</i>

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:48.303
–I mean he ain't here!
–Look again, for fuck's sake!

01:15:48.343 --> 01:15:51.318
I know what the fuck he looks like!

01:15:52.047 --> 01:15:54.743
Look behind ya!

01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:56.850
Ah! Son of a—

01:15:58.854 --> 01:16:01.482
Oh, shit!

01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:04.081
Shoot this motherfucker!

01:16:04.192 --> 01:16:06.956
No!
Fucking let the bloke go!

01:16:07.062 --> 01:16:09.963
–Let him go!
–Fuck! Jesus!

01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:12.084
Now's your chance
to earn your stripes, Roc!

01:16:12.124 --> 01:16:13.128
He'll fucking get killed!

01:16:13.168 --> 01:16:15.163
It was your idea to bring him in!

01:16:15.203 --> 01:16:17.940
One of these guys is a real sicko.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.702
He knew this man.
He wanted him to suffer.

01:16:20.742 --> 01:16:23.905
<i>All right, Roc.
Now's your chance!</i>

01:16:24.012 --> 01:16:27.412
–You take that man!
–I don't wanna die!

01:16:48.570 --> 01:16:51.437
Sick fuck! Sick fuck!

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:54.134
<i>Sick fuck!</i>

01:16:54.242 --> 01:16:58.144
–All right then.
–Fuck you, fuckin'—

01:16:58.246 --> 01:17:01.577
Now take a fuckin' deep breath
there, Roc. You did fine.

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:03.617
It was nicely done.

01:17:07.255 --> 01:17:10.156
They exited out the front door.

01:17:10.258 --> 01:17:13.573
<i>They had no idea
what they were in for.</i>

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:29.811
<i>Now they're starin'
at six men with guns drawn.</i>

01:17:29.911 --> 01:17:32.106
It was a fuckin' ambush.

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:37.179
<i>This was a fuckin' bomb…</i>

01:17:37.219 --> 01:17:39.939
<i>droppin' on Beaver Cleaverville.</i>

01:17:41.256 --> 01:17:46.216
<i>For a few seconds,
this place was Armageddon.</i>

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:50.764
There was a firefight!

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:42.574
You son of a bitch!

01:19:11.813 --> 01:19:14.281
Murph, are you all right?

01:19:14.382 --> 01:19:16.816
Motherfucker!

01:19:16.918 --> 01:19:21.056
<i>–Roc, get the fucking bag!
–Fuckin' shit! Christ!</i>

01:19:21.156 --> 01:19:24.152
–Get the blood! Get the blood!
–What the fuck was that?

01:19:24.192 --> 01:19:26.033
He shot my fucking finger off!

01:19:26.073 --> 01:19:28.657
Roc, what the fuck? Get
the fuck out of here!

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:31.564
–Motherfucker!
–Fucking shit!

01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:34.770
–Get the fucking bag!
–My fucking finger!

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:36.963
Fucking shit!

01:19:41.843 --> 01:19:45.247
What if it was just one guy with six guns?

01:19:45.347 --> 01:19:49.512
Why don't you let me do
the thinking, huh, genius?

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:53.248
Hey, what's taking so long
with those blood samples?

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:55.383
<i>I can't get a good sample.</i>

01:19:55.423 --> 01:19:57.392
Oh!

01:19:57.492 --> 01:20:00.807
There's a variable here I'm not seeing.

01:20:12.207 --> 01:20:15.870
They used ammonia.

01:20:15.977 --> 01:20:18.639
None of this is any good.
Fuck!

01:20:18.747 --> 01:20:21.877
<i>You know what that means?
Even if we get suspects in the case…</i>

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:23.879
we got nothin', nothin', nothin'!

01:20:23.919 --> 01:20:26.547
Fuck! Who the fuck are they?

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:30.385
<i>I've never seen any fucking thing
like this in my fucking life!</i>

01:20:30.425 --> 01:20:32.825
Who the fuck are they?

01:21:10.165 --> 01:21:13.895
<i>Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know
you fucking know, so don't even start.</i>

01:21:13.935 --> 01:21:16.164
Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!

01:21:16.204 --> 01:21:18.507
Well, he sure as fuck knew you!

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:21.201
Fuck you! Fuck you both!

01:21:21.309 --> 01:21:23.271
Yeah? Don't start lying to us now!

01:21:23.311 --> 01:21:26.201
We're fuckin' three amateurs here!

01:22:10.725 --> 01:22:13.893
I'm confident that
their investigation will end…

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:16.989
<i>in the apprehension of the suspects.</i>

01:22:18.099 --> 01:22:21.466
–Fuckin' hell.
–What? What, that guy?

01:22:21.569 --> 01:22:24.866
That's the guy that got us off the hook
with the Checkov thing.

01:22:24.906 --> 01:22:26.968
–And he's one smart man.
–They got nothin'.

01:22:27.008 --> 01:22:31.139
Well, this guy is very sharp.
If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.

01:22:31.179 --> 01:22:34.433
–You bet your ass he will.
–Well, I'd say that makes him…

01:22:34.473 --> 01:22:35.510
a lia-fuckin'-bility.

01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:39.187
–He isn't to be touched.
–He's a good man.

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:41.312
Okay, whatever.

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:21.519
No, that's all wrong.
David Della—

01:23:25.767 --> 01:23:27.767
I missed it.

01:23:43.485 --> 01:23:46.381
Paul, you've already had quite a bit.
Are you sure you wanna—

01:23:46.421 --> 01:23:50.016
Just pour the drink, you fairy fuck.

01:23:50.125 --> 01:23:53.561
Whew! I smell you.

01:24:09.677 --> 01:24:11.677
<i>Hey, Murph.</i>

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:14.476
This early mornin' church
shit's gotta go.

01:24:14.516 --> 01:24:19.616
We have to go in the mornin'.
We're on the lam now, you know.

01:25:16.911 --> 01:25:18.911
Hey.

01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:26.093
You're gonna do what I say, got it?

01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:32.687
–Yes.
–I'm sorry you're gonna have to see this.

01:25:32.727 --> 01:25:34.689
–Don't look at me.
–I didn't see any—

01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:36.856
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up.

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:40.628
<i>Don't do this, my son.</i>

01:25:40.735 --> 01:25:42.697
<i>Have you no fear of God?</i>

01:25:42.737 --> 01:25:46.101
That's who I'm doin' this for.
Now open the fuckin' thing, Father.

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:48.710
<i>Father, I'll do you right here.</i>

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:51.278
God have mercy on my soul.

01:25:54.482 --> 01:25:57.879
You little fuck, let him go, or
I'll drop you right fuckin' now.

01:25:57.919 --> 01:26:00.949
Okay, just calm down.
He could hurt us, brother.

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:03.418
<i>–He could ruin the whole thing.
–You let him go…</i>

01:26:03.458 --> 01:26:05.753
<i>or I will deliver you
right fucking here!</i>

01:26:05.793 --> 01:26:08.690
You won't do it. You won't, Conner.
You love me, man.

01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:10.257
–I swear to fuckin'—
–Hello. You there?

01:26:10.297 --> 01:26:11.793
–I swear to fuckin'—
–Hello. You there?

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:13.802
Y-Yes, my son.

01:26:13.902 --> 01:26:17.472
Do your thing, Father. Don't fuck this up.

01:26:19.073 --> 01:26:22.437
<i>–How long since your last confession?
–Christ.</i>

01:26:22.477 --> 01:26:25.571
I've never confessed.

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:28.171
I come here for advice…

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:30.877
not “slalvation.”

01:26:30.985 --> 01:26:35.049
<i>Why have you come to a church
for counsel if you're not religious?</i>

01:26:35.089 --> 01:26:38.149
It's ethics.

01:26:38.259 --> 01:26:41.524
I put evil men behind bars…

01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:45.533
but the law has miles
of red tape and loopholes…

01:26:45.633 --> 01:26:48.570
for these cocksuckers to slip through.

01:26:48.670 --> 01:26:52.207
<i>I found… out there
are these two guys…</i>

01:26:52.307 --> 01:26:54.836
<i>who fix the situation
with an iron fist…</i>

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:56.938
as if they had God's permission.

01:26:56.978 --> 01:26:59.380
God's permission?
God doesn't grant—

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.382
In this day and age…

01:27:01.482 --> 01:27:04.052
I believe what they do is necessary.

01:27:04.152 --> 01:27:06.152
I feel it is correct.

01:27:06.254 --> 01:27:08.583
<i>A soul is what gives us feelings.</i>

01:27:08.623 --> 01:27:11.456
It's like a conduit…

01:27:11.559 --> 01:27:14.362
through which the Lord speaks to us.

01:27:14.462 --> 01:27:17.300
<i>You felt your answers would be here…</i>

01:27:17.332 --> 01:27:20.028
<i>in the house of the Lord today.</i>

01:27:20.134 --> 01:27:24.127
<i>And you feel…
These men are necessary.</i>

01:27:26.174 --> 01:27:28.703
<i>So the Lord has spoken
to you twice today.</i>

01:27:28.743 --> 01:27:30.645
Has He now?

01:27:30.745 --> 01:27:35.476
You are the one who came into this church
speaking about beliefs and feelings.

01:27:35.516 --> 01:27:39.113
<i>Is it so hard to believe
that God has brought you here?</i>

01:27:39.153 --> 01:27:41.055
<i>I guess not.</i>

01:27:41.155 --> 01:27:44.191
It's very easy to be sarcastic
about religion.

01:27:44.192 --> 01:27:47.161
<i>But it's much more difficult…</i>

01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:49.287
to take a stand.

01:27:50.732 --> 01:27:54.369
<i>I wanna stand for what
I believe in, Father.</i>

01:27:54.469 --> 01:27:58.209
<i>First you have to know
what your beliefs are.</i>

01:27:58.439 --> 01:28:02.808
I believe that these young men are right.

01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:06.402
–You know them personally?
–Yes.

01:28:06.514 --> 01:28:10.044
Would they ever harm
an innocent person, for any reason?

01:28:10.084 --> 01:28:13.178
No. They would never do that.

01:28:13.288 --> 01:28:15.957
Well, the two Irish guys wouldn't.

01:28:16.057 --> 01:28:19.460
The Italian guy, he might.
He's kind of an idiot.

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:22.154
I'm beginning to see.

01:28:22.263 --> 01:28:25.323
All the things I wish I could do…

01:28:25.433 --> 01:28:27.924
these guys are doing.

01:28:28.036 --> 01:28:31.665
<i>W-W-What should I do?</i>

01:28:31.773 --> 01:28:35.265
Because I am a man…

01:28:35.376 --> 01:28:38.209
who's supposed to uphold the law.

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:42.113
<i>The laws of God… are higher…</i>

01:28:42.216 --> 01:28:46.346
than the laws… of man.

01:28:46.454 --> 01:28:50.725
<i>Yes, I-I was thinking that too.
No, no. I was feeling it.</i>

01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:53.885
All I needed was to hear you say it.

01:28:55.763 --> 01:28:59.324
Amen. I will help them.

01:28:59.434 --> 01:29:02.919
–Forgive me, Father.
–Thank you, Father.

01:29:05.106 --> 01:29:07.438
Whatever.

01:29:07.542 --> 01:29:09.703
Amen. Good-bye.

01:29:18.453 --> 01:29:22.856
<i>Now listen.
Um, “dominus ominus,” you know.</i>

01:29:22.957 --> 01:29:26.921
And remember, you're bound. You can't
talk to anyone about this. No one.

01:29:26.961 --> 01:29:29.564
–Just get out of the church.
–Okay.

01:29:29.664 --> 01:29:32.428
Just get out of the church!

01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:38.764
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

01:29:38.873 --> 01:29:42.103
What the fuck's that supposed to mean?

01:29:43.544 --> 01:29:46.607
–That's all you can give me?
–The light hit the side of his face.

01:29:46.647 --> 01:29:50.111
Looked like he had a gray beard.
Maybe late '50s, early '60s.

01:29:50.151 --> 01:29:52.814
So you're telling me
it was one guy with six guns…

01:29:52.854 --> 01:29:55.723
and he was a senior freakin' citizen?

01:29:55.823 --> 01:29:58.886
Yeah, and it's better if we find
this man before he finds us again.

01:29:58.926 --> 01:30:01.689
I'll see what I can do.
How do I get in touch with you?

01:30:01.729 --> 01:30:05.760
We'll hit Pappa Joe tonight,
right in the comfort of his own home.

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:08.529
We're gonna move on to New York.
It's just-…

01:30:08.569 --> 01:30:11.599
–It's getting a bit hot for us here.
–Be careful.

01:30:11.639 --> 01:30:13.835
All right.
Call you tonight, afterwards.

01:30:13.875 --> 01:30:18.465
–It feels like it's still there.
–Yeah, but it's not.

01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:22.577
<i>I don't know who he is. Nobody does.</i>

01:30:22.683 --> 01:30:26.547
<i>The Duke's a fuckin' Houdini.
He does a disappearin' act.</i>

01:30:26.587 --> 01:30:28.501
What did he bring him in for?

01:30:28.589 --> 01:30:33.117
Well, he needs an outsider.
This Rocco kid is smart.

01:30:33.227 --> 01:30:36.764
He knows everyone.
He'd spot our hitters a mile away.

01:30:36.864 --> 01:30:39.267
Just for him— the package boy?

01:30:39.367 --> 01:30:43.698
He's the one shootin' up all his guys,
right? He's scared of the kid.

01:30:43.738 --> 01:30:47.012
<i>Said he's good. He's got
every gun in the city up there.</i>

01:30:47.052 --> 01:30:47.646
Up where?

01:30:47.742 --> 01:30:50.571
Up at his house.
I don't know what's going on…

01:30:50.611 --> 01:30:52.673
<i>but I know it's gotta have
something to do with this kid.</i>

01:30:52.713 --> 01:30:54.713
Oh, fuck!

01:31:02.457 --> 01:31:05.787
We got 'em. They tried to get in
through the basement.

01:31:05.827 --> 01:31:07.827
–How many?
–Three.

01:31:16.604 --> 01:31:19.567
<i>Where you goin', huh?
Where the fuck you goin', huh?</i>

01:31:19.607 --> 01:31:23.007
I'm fuckin' talkin' to you,
motherfucker!

01:31:25.713 --> 01:31:29.672
–Fuck you!
–Shut up!

01:31:29.784 --> 01:31:31.746
Shh! Shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:31:31.786 --> 01:31:36.382
Shh.

01:31:39.227 --> 01:31:42.025
Sit up.

01:31:42.129 --> 01:31:45.189
You have some answers for me, no?

01:31:45.299 --> 01:31:48.666
Yeah. Fuck you.

01:31:50.805 --> 01:31:53.831
Roc! Roc, look at me!

01:31:53.941 --> 01:31:56.808
Roc!

01:31:56.911 --> 01:31:59.573
Shit!

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:02.979
Roc!

01:32:05.152 --> 01:32:08.553
Roc! Roc, you'll be fine!

01:32:11.325 --> 01:32:14.226
<i>Roc!</i>

01:32:16.564 --> 01:32:20.000
Okay.
What do you boys think?

01:32:20.101 --> 01:32:22.530
–These guys are tough.
–Fuckin'-A, right.

01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:24.966
–Ain't no fuckin' way they're gonna talk.
–I know Rocco.

01:32:25.006 --> 01:32:28.035
He ain't smart enough for this shit.
Those other guys are the brains.

01:32:28.075 --> 01:32:31.067
–He's just a player.
–He's a punk.

01:32:32.146 --> 01:32:34.611
There's only one thing to do.

01:32:41.522 --> 01:32:45.185
God! No!

01:32:47.995 --> 01:32:53.297
Roc! Roc! No!

01:32:55.369 --> 01:32:57.394
Roc! Roc!

01:32:57.505 --> 01:33:00.906
No!

01:33:01.008 --> 01:33:03.533
No! Roc!

01:33:03.644 --> 01:33:05.546
<i>Roc!</i>

01:33:05.646 --> 01:33:09.951
You can't stop! You get out of here.
Don't ever stop.

01:33:10.051 --> 01:33:12.713
<i>Roc! No!</i>

01:33:16.824 --> 01:33:20.817
<i>No! Roc!</i>

01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:23.624
You motherfucker!

01:33:23.731 --> 01:33:27.667
Yeah!
I'm gonna kill them!

01:33:30.771 --> 01:33:32.974
<i>–Hey, boss.
–Yeah, Chappy?</i>

01:33:33.074 --> 01:33:36.003
I don't mean no disrespect,
but I think we're forgettin' something here.

01:33:36.043 --> 01:33:39.740
This ll Duce's a fuckin' animal.
He's gonna stop when someone dies.

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:44.285
I guarantee you right now,
he thinks this thing is on.

01:33:51.993 --> 01:33:55.156
<i>What?</i>

01:33:57.865 --> 01:34:00.501
If this guy still thinks the job is on…

01:34:00.601 --> 01:34:04.469
motherfucker is in the bushes right now.

01:34:04.572 --> 01:34:08.941
I am going.
You four… stay here…

01:34:09.043 --> 01:34:11.043
and deal with it.

01:34:28.529 --> 01:34:30.554
Do it!

01:34:30.665 --> 01:34:33.901
–Just one fuckin' guy.
–Fuck you, Geno.

01:34:34.001 --> 01:34:37.231
–What's the big fuckin' deal?
–Do it!

01:34:44.712 --> 01:34:49.217
I'm going back downstairs
and workin' on these pricks.

01:34:50.651 --> 01:34:54.143
What the fuck?

01:35:09.637 --> 01:35:12.003
Hey.

01:35:12.106 --> 01:35:14.870
Joey Bevo sent me over…

01:35:14.975 --> 01:35:17.409
as entertainment.

01:35:17.511 --> 01:35:19.473
<i>Sorry, baby. Tonight
ain't the night for this shit.</i>

01:35:19.513 --> 01:35:24.552
It's really hittin' the fan in there,
you know what I'm sayin'?

01:35:24.652 --> 01:35:29.667
Fuckin' Bevo's great, man.
He's always sendin' us primo box.

01:35:45.973 --> 01:35:49.067
All right. Let's go.

01:35:58.986 --> 01:36:00.955
<i>Come here.</i>

01:36:01.055 --> 01:36:03.284
<i>–What the fuck are you doing?
–Come on, man.</i>

01:36:03.324 --> 01:36:07.828
I haven't been laid in a week.
It'll take five minutes.

01:36:07.928 --> 01:36:10.158
Hurry up!

01:36:14.769 --> 01:36:18.466
Oh, baby. Oh, come to Mama.

01:36:18.572 --> 01:36:21.104
–You're a dirty girl. No.
–Come to Mama.

01:36:21.144 --> 01:36:22.576
Oh, come to Mama. Oh.

01:36:22.676 --> 01:36:24.638
<i>–You wanna ride the champ?
–Yeah, baby.</i>

01:36:24.678 --> 01:36:26.684
All right. All right.
Let's do it, man. Ringside.

01:36:26.724 --> 01:36:27.475
<i>Big, strong man.</i>

01:36:27.515 --> 01:36:30.047
–Come on, baby.
–Yeah, that's right. You want…

01:36:30.087 --> 01:36:31.345
a little shot at the title?

01:36:31.385 --> 01:36:34.689
I'll give you a shot
at the title right here…

01:36:34.789 --> 01:36:36.789
<i>What the fuck?</i>

01:36:55.276 --> 01:36:57.276
Too far.

01:36:58.813 --> 01:37:00.813
Too far.

01:37:19.066 --> 01:37:21.066
It's on now.

01:37:23.404 --> 01:37:25.404
It's on now.

01:37:31.245 --> 01:37:34.050
Hey, babe.
What's it, two for one?

01:38:11.986 --> 01:38:13.921
“And shepherds we shall be…

01:38:14.021 --> 01:38:16.423
<i>”for Thee, my Lord, for Thee.</i>

01:38:16.523 --> 01:38:21.290
Power hath descended forth from Thy ha—”

01:38:23.530 --> 01:38:28.900
“That our feet may swiftly
carry out Thy command.

01:38:29.003 --> 01:38:32.962
<i>”We will flow a river forth
unto Thee…</i>

01:38:33.073 --> 01:38:36.634
<i>and teeming with souls
shall it ever be.”</i>

01:38:55.930 --> 01:38:58.425
<i>Standing trial today for
the third time in two years…</i>

01:38:58.465 --> 01:39:00.961
is infamous Mafia don
Pappa Joe Yakavetta.

01:39:01.001 --> 01:39:03.397
<i>Yakavetta takes the stand
to defend himself…</i>

01:39:03.437 --> 01:39:05.466
<i>against allegations
of his involvement…</i>

01:39:05.506 --> 01:39:08.636
<i>in the ordered killings
of no less than 17 men.</i>

01:39:08.676 --> 01:39:12.406
<i>The state's case against him relies
heavily on circumstantial evidence…</i>

01:39:12.446 --> 01:39:14.475
<i>and a third acquittal
has already been predicted.</i>

01:39:14.515 --> 01:39:18.645
<i>Never shall innocent blood be shed.</i>

01:39:18.752 --> 01:39:20.848
<i>Yet, the blood of the wicked…</i>

01:39:20.888 --> 01:39:23.721
<i>shall flow like a river.</i>

01:39:24.992 --> 01:39:27.421
<i>The three shall spread
their blackened wings…</i>

01:39:27.461 --> 01:39:31.116
<i>and be the vengeful,
striking hammer of God.</i>

01:39:31.832 --> 01:39:34.062
Ah, I was with my mother.

01:39:34.168 --> 01:39:36.676
We were at the Genovese—
the butcher-…

01:39:36.737 --> 01:39:39.907
because on Thursdays
she makes a gnocchi for—

01:39:40.007 --> 01:39:42.407
<i>Mr Yakavetta…</i>

01:39:42.509 --> 01:39:45.347
you will demonstrate order
in my courtroom.

01:39:45.412 --> 01:39:48.309
<i>–Counsel, proceed.
–Look at his charisma.</i>

01:39:48.349 --> 01:39:51.418
–He's the next John Gotti.
–He'll walk…

01:39:51.518 --> 01:39:53.420
even with all this evidence.

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:56.216
Look, all of Yakavetta's people
are on the left.

01:39:56.256 --> 01:39:58.852
All the families of the men
he's killed are on the right.

01:39:58.892 --> 01:40:00.794
Everyone wants some justice.

01:40:00.894 --> 01:40:04.298
–I don't know where I was.
–Look at him.

01:40:04.398 --> 01:40:06.627
He doesn't have a care in the world.

01:40:06.667 --> 01:40:09.898
He's gonna walk.

01:40:10.004 --> 01:40:13.440
<i>You, to the back!</i>

01:40:16.777 --> 01:40:18.779
Shut the fucking camera!

01:40:18.879 --> 01:40:23.183
Up top, drop your guns!
One at a time! Now! Drop it!

01:40:23.283 --> 01:40:25.346
–Come here.
–Where are you taking me?

01:40:25.386 --> 01:40:28.716
–What are you doing? What are you doing?
–Shut the fuck up!

01:40:28.756 --> 01:40:30.815
Get to the back!

01:40:35.462 --> 01:40:38.012
You people have been chosen…

01:40:39.666 --> 01:40:42.811
to reveal our existence to the world!

01:40:44.071 --> 01:40:46.974
You will witness
what happens here today…

01:40:47.074 --> 01:40:49.804
and you will tell of it later.

01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:51.812
All eyes to the front.

01:40:51.912 --> 01:40:56.842
–Now is a good time to fucking—
–Shut your fuckin' mouth!

01:41:09.696 --> 01:41:11.960
You must watch, dear.

01:41:12.066 --> 01:41:14.193
It'll all be over soon.

01:41:23.944 --> 01:41:25.913
Get down, get down, get down!

01:41:26.013 --> 01:41:28.243
Now you will receive us!

01:41:28.348 --> 01:41:31.318
We do not ask
for your poor or your hungry!

01:41:31.418 --> 01:41:33.821
We do not want your tired and sick!

01:41:33.921 --> 01:41:38.118
–It is your corrupt we claim.
–It is your evil that will be sought by us!

01:41:38.158 --> 01:41:41.328
With every breath,
we shall hunt them down.

01:41:41.428 --> 01:41:43.624
Each day we will spill their blood…

01:41:43.664 --> 01:41:45.726
till it rains down from the skies!

01:41:45.766 --> 01:41:49.003
Do not kill. Do not rape. Do not steal.

01:41:49.103 --> 01:41:52.666
<i>These are principles which every
man of every faith can embrace!</i>

01:41:52.706 --> 01:41:56.810
These are not polite suggestions!
These are codes of behavior…

01:41:56.910 --> 01:41:59.907
<i>and those of you that ignore
them will pay the dearest cost!</i>

01:41:59.947 --> 01:42:02.191
There are varying degrees of evil.

01:42:02.249 --> 01:42:07.187
We urge you lesser forms of filth
not to push the bounds and cross over…

01:42:07.287 --> 01:42:10.357
<i>into true corruption,
into our domain.</i>

01:42:10.457 --> 01:42:13.727
For if you do, one day
you will look behind you…

01:42:13.827 --> 01:42:15.789
<i>and you will see we three.</i>

01:42:15.829 --> 01:42:19.196
<i>And on that day, you will reap it!</i>

01:42:19.299 --> 01:42:23.124
And we will send you
to whatever God you wish.

01:42:27.741 --> 01:42:30.104
“And shepherds we will be,
for Thee, my Lord, for Thee.

01:42:30.144 --> 01:42:32.806
”Power hath descended forth
from Thy hand…

01:42:32.846 --> 01:42:35.909
”that our feet may swiftly
carry out Thy command.

01:42:35.949 --> 01:42:38.212
“So we shall flow a river forth to Thee…

01:42:38.252 --> 01:42:41.737
and teeming with souls shall it ever be.”

01:43:02.242 --> 01:43:04.278
Did you see what happened?

01:43:04.378 --> 01:43:06.710
Yes, I was there.

01:43:13.353 --> 01:43:17.050
How far are we going to take this, Da?

01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:25.810
The question is not how far.

01:43:27.267 --> 01:43:32.500
The question is,
do you possess the constitution…

01:43:32.606 --> 01:43:35.200
the depth of faith…

01:43:35.309 --> 01:43:37.519
to go as far as is needed?

01:43:41.615 --> 01:43:44.144
After the astonishing display
of vigilantism…

01:43:44.184 --> 01:43:46.346
during the Yakavetta trial yesterday…

01:43:46.386 --> 01:43:49.249
the largest manhunt in recent
memory is being undertaken…

01:43:49.289 --> 01:43:52.753
to capture three men the media
have dubbed “the Saints.”

01:43:52.793 --> 01:43:54.758
This reporter went out to the street to…

01:43:54.798 --> 01:43:56.857
find out what you thought
about these three.

01:43:56.897 --> 01:43:59.126
Somebody can just go out,
get a gun and shoot somebody…

01:43:59.166 --> 01:44:01.595
because they feel they're
doing some good in the world?

01:44:01.635 --> 01:44:04.166
–No comment.
–Making the world a safer place.

01:44:04.206 --> 01:44:05.132
Are you kidding?

01:44:05.172 --> 01:44:07.797
They're killing for good
and only the people who kill.

01:44:07.837 --> 01:44:08.735
Listen to yourself.

01:44:08.775 --> 01:44:10.737
This is gonna create
something so much worse.

01:44:10.777 --> 01:44:14.241
–I don't think so at all.
–Well, I think you're just naive then.

01:44:14.281 --> 01:44:16.310
I love the Saints, man.
They doin' a great job.

01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:18.845
Keep it goin', man.
Get these murderers off the streets.

01:44:18.885 --> 01:44:21.381
They're not out there just killing for fame.

01:44:21.421 --> 01:44:24.218
–They just wanna be famous.
–They should be in every major city.

01:44:24.258 --> 01:44:26.220
–Every major city.
–These guys are playing God.

01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:28.889
This whole religious twist.
Who do they think they are?

01:44:28.929 --> 01:44:31.959
I believe in capital punishment.
If they let me, I'd pull the switch.

01:44:31.999 --> 01:44:33.715
Get 'em all! Kill 'em all!

01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:39.700
The more people they kill, the better
it is for everybody. That's what they get—

01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:42.202
No, do not do that, Laquelle,
because you don't even know!

01:44:42.242 --> 01:44:45.112
–Sign me up, man.
–Sign me up. All right?

01:44:45.212 --> 01:44:47.908
–Where can I sign up?
–Who are they to be judge and jury?

01:44:47.948 --> 01:44:51.418
–No. What if your mom sees?
–No comment.

01:44:51.518 --> 01:44:53.413
–No comment.
–I'm afraid for myself.

01:44:53.453 --> 01:44:55.415
I'm afraid for my kids.
I'm afraid to walk down the street.

01:44:55.455 --> 01:44:57.618
I can't even believe you're
saying that. That's crazy.

01:44:57.658 --> 01:44:59.620
When did you turn into such a sissy?

01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:02.656
–I think they just get off on killing people.
–Well, I have no comment.

01:45:02.696 --> 01:45:05.826
–No comment on that, dear.
–I have nothing to say. Thanks.

01:45:05.866 --> 01:45:08.862
All this hoopla with the media.
You guys are making it worse right now.

01:45:08.902 --> 01:45:10.816
You're giving them the power.

01:45:10.904 --> 01:45:13.133
By sticking that in my face,
you're giving the Saints power.

01:45:13.173 --> 01:45:17.204
–I don't wanna talk about it.
–I really don't wanna talk about that.

01:45:17.244 --> 01:45:19.806
You walk into some kid's bedroom,
and it's gonna be there.

01:45:19.846 --> 01:45:22.542
You have Batman, Superman
and these Saints.

01:45:22.582 --> 01:45:24.544
Are you losing any sleep, honey?

01:45:24.584 --> 01:45:27.848
–'Cause you know what? I'm certainly not.
–No comment.

01:45:27.888 --> 01:45:31.518
–Don't talk to them.
–They're damn good. They're right!

01:45:33.393 --> 01:45:35.422
Okay? I'm ready to get busy too.

01:45:35.462 --> 01:45:38.097
<i>You know,
I'm ready to get busy.</i>
