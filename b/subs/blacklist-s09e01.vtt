00:03.086 --> 00:05.714
If you took over for Reddington,
inherited the Blacklist...

00:05.797 --> 00:07.674
One task, then it's done.

00:07.757 --> 00:11.052
What could possibly be left for me to do?

00:11.136 --> 00:12.178
To take my life.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.555
I can't do it.

00:15.557 --> 00:17.017
That's all right.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.226
[gunshot]

00:24.232 --> 00:25.567
[Dembe] Raymond, we must.

00:25.650 --> 00:27.027
I'm sorry.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.570
[Liz] How does it end?

00:29.904 --> 00:30.989
[Raymond] You'll find out.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.210
Her name is Elizabeth?

00:44.294 --> 00:46.212
Do you believe in love at first sight?

00:46.296 --> 00:47.589
I didn't.

00:47.672 --> 00:50.091
Not till she walked into that restaurant.

00:51.050 --> 00:52.343
I knew an Elizabeth.

00:52.427 --> 00:57.307
I've only known her for two weeks,
but when you know, you know, am I right?

00:57.390 --> 00:58.475
I never did.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.435
But I'm glad you do.

01:00.518 --> 01:02.187
Tell me about her.

01:02.270 --> 01:03.438
Your Elizabeth.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.984
She wasn't my Elizabeth.
She was my friend.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.779
She died two years ago.

01:10.862 --> 01:11.905
I'm sorry.

01:21.414 --> 01:22.499
Truck's loaded up.

01:22.582 --> 01:26.628
-Wire the payment and you're good to go.
-Yeah, listen, about that...

01:30.924 --> 01:34.427
-The agreement was you come alone.
-Agreements change.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.137
My associate's a trusting fellow.

01:36.221 --> 01:40.308
He sees nothing but possibility
in stealing a truckload of microchips.

01:40.391 --> 01:43.186
Especially when one
of the eagerly corrupt port employees

01:43.269 --> 01:45.021
asks a lot of questions.

01:45.104 --> 01:46.648
So I asked some of my own.

01:47.482 --> 01:48.733
He's a cop.

01:50.985 --> 01:53.071
What should I do about that?

01:54.072 --> 01:55.990
Make sure he's never found.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.412
Kill him.

02:01.996 --> 02:04.040
Go on. Your partner's a cop.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.918
Show me you're not one too.

02:12.632 --> 02:15.093
See, I told you. Nothing to worry about.

FBI.

02:48.710 --> 02:49.669
No, no!

02:51.921 --> 02:54.716
[man 1] See what the FBI knows first,
then kill him.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.259
And get rid of the bodies.

02:56.342 --> 02:57.719
You, get the truck. Go.

03:00.138 --> 03:03.308
-There's a diamond ring in his pocket.
-I'm through trusting you.

03:03.391 --> 03:05.310
It's two carats at least.

03:13.109 --> 03:14.611
[man 2] Well, well...

04:19.926 --> 04:21.719
<i>So, what happened and why?</i>

04:22.303 --> 04:23.471
<i>The why is simple.</i>

04:23.554 --> 04:25.014
<i>The world runs on microchips.</i>

04:25.098 --> 04:28.768
<i>Our phones, our cars,</i>
<i>the planes we fly in.</i>

04:28.851 --> 04:33.523
<i>The concern is that America manufactures</i>
<i>only 12% of the world's semiconductors.</i>

04:33.606 --> 04:36.442
<i>The most advanced chips</i>
<i>are manufactured in Taiwan.</i>

04:36.526 --> 04:40.154
<i>If our ability to import them</i>

04:44.284 --> 04:45.118
<i>Absolutely.</i>

04:45.201 --> 04:47.704
-What are you watching?
-My ex-boss.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.928
It's okay. I'm prepared for it.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.974
No one's prepared for Conroy.

05:08.057 --> 05:09.475
You endure Conroy.

05:09.559 --> 05:10.852
You suffer him.

05:10.935 --> 05:14.188
You supplicate yourself

05:14.272 --> 05:17.150
that he will agree to be
an angel investor in our idea,

05:17.233 --> 05:21.112

for costing us our life savings.

05:21.195 --> 05:22.864
So, you know...

05:24.782 --> 05:26.576
I need you to focus on that.

05:26.659 --> 05:28.494
-Only that.
-Okay.

<i>Criminal empires are</i>
<i>like authoritarian regimes,</i>

05:32.707 --> 05:35.126

05:35.209 --> 05:39.547
<i>When that power becomes</i>
<i>decentralized or fractured,</i>

05:39.630 --> 05:42.133
<i>it leads to a period</i>

05:42.216 --> 05:46.012
<i>So when the leader of a criminal</i>

-[nurse] Stubborn.

06:19.128 --> 06:21.339

Six months undercover, I don't know
the buyer, all I have is that.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.458
Both mercs had it.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.418
-Do you know what it means?
-No.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.088
Neither does anyone at the bureau.

-A year and a half.

and I listen to you blah-blah-blah

07:47.091 --> 07:49.218
about playing it so safe,
that if I didn't know better,

07:49.302 --> 07:52.096
I'd say you were once
the CEO of an insurance company.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.806
But I do know better.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.559
Better than an old fool
the world's passed by.

07:56.642 --> 07:59.687
What you see as a problem,
I see as an opportunity.

08:01.063 --> 08:04.066
I doubt the buyer thinks
his microchips getting incinerated

08:04.150 --> 08:07.820
-is much of an opportunity.
-Plan A was to get the product.

08:07.904 --> 08:11.532
Plan B is to get to the secret
to how the product is made.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.243
That way the buyer
can make the product themselves.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.912
There's gonna be an investigation.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.705
Things could get exposed.

08:17.788 --> 08:20.082
If I were you, I'd let it go.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.000
You were me.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.171
And you gave it all up to play golf.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.008
May I borrow this?

08:29.091 --> 08:30.468
Gonna hit some balls?

08:30.551 --> 08:32.094
Yeah.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.679
Might give them a whack.

08:39.435 --> 08:40.394
[man] It's not my fault.

08:40.478 --> 08:43.231

about where the chips would be.

08:43.314 --> 08:45.816

08:50.988 --> 08:53.533
The knowledge and the processing software.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.910
The person who can give me both

-I don't know.

09:00.748 --> 09:01.582

09:07.880 --> 09:11.008
Are the fingers supposed
to be interlocked?

09:11.092 --> 09:12.093
Forget it.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.720
If get it wrong, I'll take a, uh--

09:14.804 --> 09:15.805
What do you call it?

09:15.888 --> 09:16.722
A mulligan?

09:16.806 --> 09:19.100

09:40.371 --> 09:41.539
I know why you're here.

09:41.622 --> 09:42.915
I've sent for the doctor.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.458

09:44.542 --> 09:46.043
Which is why I called the doctor.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.753

09:47.837 --> 09:50.548
You put a mark on a mailbox,
I call the doctor.

09:51.048 --> 09:54.302
If Reddington wants you to find him,
you will. If he doesn't, you won't.

09:54.385 --> 09:55.803
Sit. Drink.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.484
I'm sure you will.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.695
But that won't be for a few days.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.031
There was a flood in the Amazon.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.949
-The Amazon?
-Mm-hm.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.328
I thought he was in Cuba.

10:20.411 --> 10:21.412
He might be.

10:22.204 --> 10:24.081
-Eventually.
-I can't wait.

10:25.708 --> 10:28.252
This is why I came.

10:28.336 --> 10:29.754
It's urgent.

10:35.176 --> 10:39.055
Once you finish his scan
and his identity is verified,

10:39.555 --> 10:41.182
I'll call the sisters.

Tell me.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.361
[Cooper] A cloudy orb.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.615
Is that good or bad?

11:39.698 --> 11:40.866
You may pass.

11:40.950 --> 11:41.951
Very few do.

11:42.785 --> 11:43.619
Go.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.121
I will watch over you.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.095
How is Agnes?

12:01.595 --> 12:02.513
She's good.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.181
Thriving.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.059
I see you've met Weecha.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.978
[Cooper] And a bartender who drugged me.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.439
And a shaman who rubbed me with an egg.

12:11.522 --> 12:14.775
Hmm. Weecha protects my body.
Mierce, my soul.

12:14.859 --> 12:18.154
I wouldn't have survived the past
two years if I hadn't found them.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.955
What do you want, Harold?

12:28.581 --> 12:29.623
It's about Dembe.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.625
How is Special Agent Zuma?

12:31.709 --> 12:34.462
In the hospital with third degree burns.

12:34.545 --> 12:36.464
His partner was shot and killed.

12:36.547 --> 12:39.758
We don't know anything about
the assailants except for this tattoo.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.427
You don't wanna show me that.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.888
I do if it will help Dembe.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.474
During the past two years,

12:46.557 --> 12:49.768
I've learned what to hold onto
and what to let go of.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.982
If I look at that,
if I come back even once...

12:58.444 --> 13:00.863
I fear all that work will be for nothing.

13:01.489 --> 13:05.534
There would be names to be taken.
People would be held accountable.

13:06.494 --> 13:09.079
Down the line, things would get very dark.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.414
[Cooper] Then don't come back.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.249
But tell me what I need to know.

13:12.917 --> 13:13.834
The symbol.

13:14.585 --> 13:15.794
Do you know it?

13:19.423 --> 13:20.466
Yes.

13:20.549 --> 13:22.968
-You know who we're looking for?
-I do.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.764
A 700-year-old pirate.

13:29.433 --> 13:32.520
[in Mandarin] It's all here.
Hotel address, plane tickets,

13:32.603 --> 13:33.979
rental car info.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.773
I'd be lost without you.

13:36.565 --> 13:37.566
Don't look so worried.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.026
If the meetings go well,

13:39.109 --> 13:41.111
we could be building
a new plant in America

13:41.195 --> 13:42.571
by this time next year.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.948
You land tomorrow.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.908
You'll have a day before your flight

13:45.991 --> 13:47.326
to Washington, D.C.

13:47.409 --> 13:50.120
Please tell me you're doing something
fun while we're away.

13:50.204 --> 13:53.791
Pai-han's idea of fun is solving
what happened at the port.

13:53.874 --> 13:57.670
I've told him to leave it to the police,
but he won't let it go.

13:58.254 --> 14:01.882
If you need anything,
if anything happens, call me.

14:02.675 --> 14:03.842
You're silly.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.594
What could happen?

14:06.178 --> 14:08.138
Nothing. Don't listen to me.

14:08.764 --> 14:10.307
Go. Have fun.

14:15.437 --> 14:16.480
[speaking Mandarin]

14:27.491 --> 14:28.659
[cell phone dialing]

14:30.035 --> 14:32.162
[in English]
I'm sending you his itinerary.

14:32.246 --> 14:35.332
<i>Chen's staying at the Fountain Grand</i>
<i>with his wife and daughter.</i>

14:35.416 --> 14:36.709
The more the merrier.

14:41.672 --> 14:42.631
FBI!

14:42.715 --> 14:44.091
Open the door!

14:45.801 --> 14:47.177
[suspenseful music playing]

14:49.430 --> 14:52.683
Put your hands where we can see them!

14:52.766 --> 14:53.767
[Park] You're all dead!

14:53.851 --> 14:55.895
Well, that sucked.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.939
-Perkins?
-We didn't sweep every room.

14:59.023 --> 15:01.775
-First rule after a breach?
-Sweep every room.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.110
Let's run it again.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.452
-Hello, Alina.
-I heard about Dembe.

15:11.535 --> 15:12.870
-How is he?
-Not good.

15:12.953 --> 15:15.372
Which is why I came. We have a case.

15:15.456 --> 15:18.208
-I'm not a field agent anymore.
-And I'm not with the bureau.

15:18.292 --> 15:21.253
But Dembe asked me to do this.
Now I'm asking you.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.547
Just this once.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.758
I trained Ken. And I wanna help Dembe--

15:25.841 --> 15:28.677
Congratulations, by the way,
on the wedding. I'm happy for you.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.346
It's been great.

15:30.429 --> 15:33.599
If I wanna keep it that way,
I can't go back.

15:33.682 --> 15:35.684
I promised Peter I wouldn't go back.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.061
Didn't know you trained Ken.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.687
He was in my first class.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.023
He was a good agent and a better man.

15:41.106 --> 15:44.151
I know the stress field work
can put on you. I do.

15:44.234 --> 15:45.903
And still I'm asking.

15:45.986 --> 15:47.988
That's how important I think this is.

15:51.033 --> 15:55.746
So Flagify is a company that warns clients
about security issues or red flags.

15:55.829 --> 15:59.833
It has multiple platforms, each designed
to fulfill a different security need.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.336
Now, ShadowSee is piracy detection.

16:02.419 --> 16:05.631
It scans up to a million websites an hour
to determine

16:05.714 --> 16:09.635
if a specific product is being used
in violation to copyright restrictions.

16:09.718 --> 16:13.389
-Now, GreyLock uses keywords to, um--
-[cell phone buzzing]

16:13.472 --> 16:15.015
I'm sorry. It's--

16:15.099 --> 16:17.309
Nothing. It's nothing.

16:20.229 --> 16:22.773
-You were talking about GreyLock.
-Yes.

16:22.856 --> 16:27.319
GreyLock uses keywords
to determine sentiment analysis.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.738
-This function has a forensic--
-[cell phone buzzing]

16:30.739 --> 16:33.784
Uh, dear. I think I should take this.
I'm so sorry.

16:33.867 --> 16:37.746
I don't invest in sorry.
I invest in focus and concentration.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.874
In the people who have it,
not in the people who don't.

16:40.958 --> 16:44.003
Just-- Just, um-- Sir?

16:44.086 --> 16:46.338
My parents took out
a second mortgage for us.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.174
Tell whoever that is
he just cost them their house.

16:50.384 --> 16:51.468
One second, Nick--

16:53.012 --> 16:53.846
Mr. Cooper.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.393
[monitor beeping]

17:20.914 --> 17:22.833
I hope it wasn't a bad time to bother you.

17:22.916 --> 17:23.751
It wasn't bad.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.045
It was a horribly bad time.

17:27.379 --> 17:28.589
There's the Scotch.

17:36.555 --> 17:37.681
What did Peter say?

17:38.265 --> 17:40.225
What makes you think I told him?

17:45.606 --> 17:46.690
Thanks for coming.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.567
Let's get started.

17:49.526 --> 17:51.070
What about Ressler?

17:55.365 --> 17:56.492
Nice ride.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.411
The answer's no.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.164
You don't know what I'm gonna ask.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.958
You came all the way to Detroit to ask it.

18:05.042 --> 18:07.336
Saw you on the news
talking about Reddington.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.797
At least it sounded like Reddington.

18:09.880 --> 18:13.467
-I was just answering a question.
-Then please answer mine.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.761
Is Reddington involved?

18:15.844 --> 18:16.970
Not really.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.806
"Not really" isn't "no."

18:19.556 --> 18:20.933
Which is my answer.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.770
He still blames Reddington
for what happened.

18:24.853 --> 18:25.729
We all do.

18:27.397 --> 18:30.609
Well, I guess the difference for me,
and maybe you guys as well,

18:30.692 --> 18:35.280
is I believe Mr. Reddington blames himself
and I forgive him for it.

18:37.157 --> 18:38.408
The silicon shield.

18:38.492 --> 18:39.910
Tell me what you know about it.

18:39.993 --> 18:43.789
Right. It's a term used to describe
the protection Taiwan gets

18:43.872 --> 18:46.333
for being the sole manufacturer
of next-gen microchips.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.418
Protection from America
which might go to war

18:48.502 --> 18:50.504
to prevent the supply
from being disrupted.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.132
We're talking about a tripwire.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.634
One the Skinner apparently wants to trip.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.427
-The Skinner?
-Right.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.513
How to explain this?

18:59.596 --> 19:02.057
According to Reddington,
highway robbery and plunder

19:02.141 --> 19:04.393
may not be the second-oldest profession...

19:04.476 --> 19:06.186
But it runs a close third.

19:07.729 --> 19:12.734
The Skinner practices a well-documented
version of brigandage.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.403
The dacoits in India.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.488
Gentlemen Reivers in Scotland.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.032
In Devonshire, the Gubbings.

19:19.116 --> 19:21.702
In America, highwaymen.

19:21.785 --> 19:24.997
Different countries, different centuries.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.373
All outlaws.

19:26.957 --> 19:29.626
-And in France...
-And in France, the écorcheurs.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.086
The flayers.

19:31.670 --> 19:35.090
Armed bands who rose up
in opposition to Charles VII.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.634
They took what they wanted
and when people resisted,

19:37.718 --> 19:39.344
they burned their feet.

19:39.428 --> 19:42.222
The mercs Dembe shot all had this.

19:42.306 --> 19:45.976
Fire surrounding the letter S,
for "the Skinners."

19:46.059 --> 19:47.477
Who burned people alive.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.605
So we know who they were.

19:49.688 --> 19:50.564
Who are they now?

19:50.647 --> 19:54.818
The original Skinner died
quite suddenly in 1452.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.654
He had a fearsome reputation

19:57.738 --> 20:00.240
and his followers worried
that without him,

20:00.324 --> 20:01.825
their days were numbered.

20:01.909 --> 20:05.537
So as no one knew he had died,

20:05.621 --> 20:08.665
they elevated one of their own
to take his place,

20:08.749 --> 20:12.628
beginning a line of succession
that continues to this day.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.839
The Skinner is more myth than man,

20:15.923 --> 20:19.426
so the identity of the man
personifying the myth...

20:20.219 --> 20:23.347
has always been
a carefully guarded secret.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.265
[Aram]
And does Mr. Reddington know the secret?

20:25.349 --> 20:26.642
If he does, he's not saying.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.185
He's not coming back?

20:29.811 --> 20:32.481
Come on, even for Dembe?
How is that possible?

20:32.564 --> 20:34.107
I don't know. And he wouldn't say.

20:34.191 --> 20:37.402
All I know is it's our job
to find the current Skinner

20:37.486 --> 20:41.865
whose goal it was to steal 800,000
of the world's most advanced microchips.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.325
Dembe stopped him once.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.077
Unless we find him, he'll try again.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.370
[Aram] Before we do that...

20:47.579 --> 20:50.457
I know none of us expected
to be here and it's--

20:51.625 --> 20:54.628
It's hard and a little weird.

20:54.711 --> 20:56.255
But if it's okay with you,

20:56.338 --> 20:59.091
I'd like us to take a moment to...

21:00.676 --> 21:02.094
To remember Liz.

21:02.177 --> 21:03.595
You know, uh...

21:04.596 --> 21:05.681
together.

21:06.473 --> 21:07.557
Think we could do that?

21:08.058 --> 21:10.602
I'm embarrassed
I didn't suggest it myself.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.446
[Mierce speaking Kaqchikel]

21:38.964 --> 21:40.632
I bet she's happy here.

21:40.716 --> 21:41.967
She's also asleep.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.388
Mierce has powers, Harold.

21:47.055 --> 21:48.598
All for the good.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.600
Agnes is fine.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.314
What if I wanted to see her?

21:57.357 --> 21:59.234
I don't think that would be a good idea.

22:07.993 --> 22:11.788
I don't know who the current Skinner is,

22:11.872 --> 22:14.082
but I do know his predecessor.

22:14.624 --> 22:16.460
That's where we're gonna start.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.009
[Park] He just showed up,
in the middle of the night?

22:24.092 --> 22:24.926
With a witch?

22:25.010 --> 22:27.387
The more you think about it,
the less sense it makes.

22:27.471 --> 22:29.639
Like a Skinner
living in a retirement community.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.767
[Cooper]
<i>Don't let the salmon shirt fool you.</i>

22:31.850 --> 22:34.102
Remember what Reddington told me
about the old Skinner.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.188
His name is Vincent Duke.

22:36.271 --> 22:39.316
He ran the organization
for almost 30 years.

22:39.399 --> 22:44.154
Built on its history of hijacking
whatever commodity was most in demand.

22:44.237 --> 22:48.283
His predecessors commandeered guns
from the Spanish Armada,

22:48.366 --> 22:51.078
gold from Russian tsars.

22:51.703 --> 22:55.082
Duke's plunder
was a little more contemporary.

22:55.165 --> 22:58.752
Everything from
intellectual property to uranium.

22:58.835 --> 23:01.463
If you know him, why do you
need our help to make contact?

23:01.546 --> 23:03.090
[Raymond] We had a falling out.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.508
Over a word.

23:05.133 --> 23:06.635
-One word?
-Yes.

23:06.718 --> 23:07.803
"Ex."

23:08.887 --> 23:11.389
As in ex-wife. Apparently, she wasn't.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.476
Here we go.

23:15.143 --> 23:16.770
[suspenseful music playing]

23:20.816 --> 23:23.860
-[Aram] You ready for this?
-[Cooper] I'm not looking forward to it.

23:23.944 --> 23:26.780
He's leaving the country club,
turning onto Saw Mill Road.

23:26.863 --> 23:28.365
He's heading your way.

23:34.579 --> 23:35.622
[Cooper] I have a 20.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.794
[tires screeching]

23:43.046 --> 23:45.173
-You all right, sir?
-I'm fine.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.634
Go, deal with it, and get us out of here.

23:53.557 --> 23:56.184
-What the hell happened?
-That's my question.

23:56.268 --> 23:59.688
-You slammed on the brakes.
-I just bought this car. It's brand new.

23:59.771 --> 24:03.150
-You stopped short.
-I stopped--? Oh, so this is my fault?

24:03.650 --> 24:05.193
You hit me from behind.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.154
Everybody, step to the side of the road.

24:07.237 --> 24:09.990
-Who was driving?
-I was. And this man.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.995
-Hands in the air!
-Whoa, take it easy.

24:15.078 --> 24:17.414
-I'm licensed to carry.
-[Park] Up against the car. Now.

24:17.497 --> 24:19.082
[bodyguard] We're both armed security.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.501
If that's true, then there's
nothing to worry about,

24:21.585 --> 24:23.670
but we'll have to check it out.

24:24.754 --> 24:27.841
What's going on?
Officer, this was an accident.

24:27.924 --> 24:29.801
Sir, I'll have to ask you to stay there.

24:32.179 --> 24:35.515
Let's wrap this up before
anyone can crash the party.

24:44.858 --> 24:45.984
[car horn honks]

24:51.531 --> 24:53.575
Vincent. Need a lift?

24:57.078 --> 25:01.416
That's why you've kidnapped me,
to ask me to betray my own organization.

25:01.499 --> 25:03.710
No. To urge you to save it.

25:03.793 --> 25:05.962
What makes you think it needs saving?

25:06.046 --> 25:09.841
Well, I know about the microchips
and the dead FBI agent

25:09.925 --> 25:11.927
and the one in intensive care.

25:12.010 --> 25:15.055
I know port security
has increased as a result,

25:15.138 --> 25:17.515
which certainly hurts my organization.

25:17.599 --> 25:21.102
So you're not here to help me.
You're here to save yourself.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.855
Self-serving as always.

25:24.481 --> 25:26.691
-How is Bianca?
-No idea.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.860
You'd have to ask the golf pro.

25:30.111 --> 25:34.449
The last thing you and I want
is the American government on alert,

25:34.532 --> 25:37.285
adding billions to Homeland Security.

25:37.369 --> 25:40.830
Is that really gonna happen
over a shipment of microchips?

25:40.914 --> 25:43.583
SCG microchips, that, apparently,

25:43.667 --> 25:46.920
none of the brilliant minds
in America know how to make.

25:47.003 --> 25:50.298
Any hint of a weak link
in that supply chain

25:50.382 --> 25:54.302
will be viewed as a huge
national security threat.

25:55.887 --> 25:59.933
I don't like what he did.
But I have no influence on my successor.

26:00.016 --> 26:02.269
Believe me, I've tried to exert it.

26:02.352 --> 26:04.479
You picked an unworthy successor.

26:05.105 --> 26:09.359
That's not a judgment.
I failed spectacularly when I tried.

26:09.442 --> 26:12.195
But it's true, and something
needs to be done about it.

26:15.323 --> 26:18.076
I'm sorry about the golf pro, by the way.

26:18.159 --> 26:19.077
Don't be.

26:19.619 --> 26:22.372
Before they ran off, he fixed my slice.

26:22.455 --> 26:24.708
All in all, a pretty fair exchange.

26:30.338 --> 26:32.590
[Raymond] Vincent, you're certain? "Beck"?

26:33.133 --> 26:35.844
Thank you.
I'll call you when it's resolved.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.638
[cell phone dialing]

26:38.722 --> 26:39.973
[line ringing]

26:41.057 --> 26:42.851
-[Cooper] <i>Cooper.</i>
-Harold, I have news.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.186
The Skinner is in New York
at the Fountain Grand

26:45.270 --> 26:46.980
under the name Clayton Beck.

26:47.063 --> 26:50.150
You trust Duke's intel?
That he's willing to betray his successor?

26:50.233 --> 26:54.571
He understands that the legacy
is more important than any one Skinner.

26:54.654 --> 26:58.325
Why New York? It can't be the microchips.
They're not shipped to the East Coast.

26:58.408 --> 27:01.328
Perhaps he's found
another way to skin this cat.

27:01.411 --> 27:03.580
Listen, I have Edward standing by.

27:03.663 --> 27:06.416
If you want it, you can be wheels up
as soon as you're ready.

27:06.499 --> 27:08.835
That's a generous offer,
and I'll take you up on it.

27:08.918 --> 27:12.589
But before I do, I want to circle back
to Agnes, our conversation earlier.

27:12.672 --> 27:14.674
You were clear about boundaries.

27:14.758 --> 27:17.385
<i>Yes. I want to thank you</i>
<i>for respecting them.</i>

27:17.469 --> 27:19.846
Elizabeth made you Agnes' guardian.

27:19.929 --> 27:22.307
<i>She was confident you'd do right by her.</i>

27:22.390 --> 27:24.893
I have no doubt you have and you will.

27:27.228 --> 27:28.813
When will you tell me...

27:29.898 --> 27:31.316
what she means to you?

27:33.234 --> 27:34.903
I can tell you now.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.406
She means everything to me.

27:49.709 --> 27:51.753
[Park] Sorry, but something's come up.

27:52.462 --> 27:56.132
I don't know how late,
but, yes, as soon as possible.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.675
Mm-hm. Love you too.

27:58.510 --> 28:03.264
Take it from me, keeping secrets
is not the secret to a happy marriage.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.766
I'm not keeping secrets.

28:04.849 --> 28:06.810
I'm keeping the peace.

28:06.893 --> 28:10.188
-Isn't it possible Peter will understand?
-How could he? I don't.

28:10.271 --> 28:13.900
What am I doing in the field?
I left for my mental health.

28:13.983 --> 28:15.735
Yeah, well, you and me both.

28:16.361 --> 28:19.531
Well, here's a pleasant surprise.

28:20.365 --> 28:21.991
Aram called me about Dembe.

28:22.075 --> 28:23.993
He'll appreciate your concern.

28:24.077 --> 28:27.747
I came out of concern
and curiosity about his health

28:27.831 --> 28:30.166
and how the hell he became an agent.

28:30.792 --> 28:31.668
You look a mess.

28:33.336 --> 28:34.754
Where is Aram, anyway?

28:34.838 --> 28:37.215
That's another reason I'm here,
to take his place.

28:37.298 --> 28:40.719
He said he had to bail, something about
everything he's been working on

28:40.802 --> 28:43.930
for two years blowing up in his face
and him needing to try to fix it.

28:44.013 --> 28:47.892
You were right, by the way.
Reddington is involved. Sort of.

28:47.976 --> 28:51.438
Then I hope we're never
in the same room together.

28:52.063 --> 28:55.525
Aram tells me we're going after
some 700-year-old pirate.

28:55.608 --> 28:58.486
We don't know his real name,
but Dembe's given us a description,

28:58.570 --> 29:02.490
and he's on his way
to a hotel in New York, and so are we.

29:07.370 --> 29:11.124
You sure this is right?
The concierge said that Beck came here.

29:11.207 --> 29:14.377
Said he asked for directions
about an hour ago. Why, he didn't know.

29:14.461 --> 29:17.547
Well, it's safe to say
it's not to smell the flowers.

29:17.630 --> 29:20.842
Whatever the reason, we're not leaving
until we find out what it was.

29:25.054 --> 29:26.806
[Aram] Okay. Deep breath.

29:27.348 --> 29:29.058
[doorbell rings]

29:31.728 --> 29:34.898
-Oh. You're not Eric and Barbara.
-No, not Eric and Barbara.

29:34.981 --> 29:38.151
Or Eric or... Barbara.

29:38.234 --> 29:39.736
[Conroy] Is that Eric and Barbara?

29:41.279 --> 29:43.490
-Hello.
-You've got to be kidding me.

29:43.573 --> 29:46.367
I know. I'm way out of line
coming to your home,

29:46.451 --> 29:49.537
but I was hoping you'd give me
just two minutes to explain.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.999
-You had your two minutes.
-You walked out after about a minute,

29:53.082 --> 29:55.251
so I have unused time on the clock.

29:55.335 --> 29:57.712
At least about, say, 40 seconds.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.465
-You should leave.
-Come on, Henry. He's here.

30:00.548 --> 30:02.050
And he's flop sweating.

30:02.133 --> 30:06.304
The party can spare your sparkling
conversation for 40 seconds.

30:09.140 --> 30:12.852
You'll get your 40 seconds
once my guests all have drinks.

30:12.936 --> 30:14.229
I used to be an FBI agent.

30:14.312 --> 30:16.773
The call, during the pitch,
it was from my old boss.

30:16.856 --> 30:19.651
You're wasting your 40 seconds telling me
what you used to do?

30:19.734 --> 30:22.487
He needed help on a case
with national security implications.

30:22.570 --> 30:27.200
He's actually working the case now
without me, because I'm here with you

30:27.283 --> 30:28.368
flop sweating.

30:29.744 --> 30:30.995
I'll be back.

30:31.079 --> 30:32.330
Don't sit.

30:32.956 --> 30:34.249
Don't touch.

30:37.001 --> 30:38.002
Gotcha.

30:39.379 --> 30:41.548
So Dembe's an FBI agent now, huh?

30:41.631 --> 30:44.425
-I think it's cool.
<i>-Special agent for the FBI?</i>

30:45.051 --> 30:47.011
It sounds like you have
a problem with that.

30:47.095 --> 30:50.557
Problem, questions.
We started with a background check.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.475
<i>Did the bureau abolish them?</i>

30:53.017 --> 30:55.854
Hang on. That's him.
Right side of the statue.

30:55.937 --> 30:57.814
[Cooper]
<i>Maintain your position. What's he doing?</i>

30:57.897 --> 31:00.733
[Park] Watching the concession stand.
Looks like he's on comms.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.193
He's got company.

31:03.987 --> 31:06.614
All right, I've got a second suspect.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.658
<i>Near the Madison Avenue exit.</i>

31:08.741 --> 31:10.869
Careful. We have to assume they're armed.

31:10.952 --> 31:14.747
He's surveilling somebody by the vendor,
the family buying hot dogs.

31:14.831 --> 31:15.957
I see them.

31:17.458 --> 31:18.459
Who the hell is that?

31:18.543 --> 31:19.711
[chuckling]

31:28.136 --> 31:29.262
I'm sending you a photo.

31:29.345 --> 31:31.890
-Sir, I told Ressler--
<i>-I know what you told him.</i>

31:31.973 --> 31:34.350
But the Skinner's tracking someone.
Tell me who.

31:34.434 --> 31:36.728
-I'm not at my desk.
-Then sit at someone else's.

31:36.811 --> 31:39.105
-Aram, this is important.
-Hang on.

31:39.689 --> 31:40.773
Okay. Um...

31:41.691 --> 31:43.151
An Asian man, that's it?

31:43.234 --> 31:46.362
-The chips come from Taiwan.
<i>-Okay, great. That helps.</i>

31:46.446 --> 31:50.033
-SCG microchips.
-That's better. It helps narrow it down.

31:50.116 --> 31:52.660
All you need to do is hack
into the employee database.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.787
That's not great or better.
I can't do that.

31:54.871 --> 31:56.414
Sir, I can do that.

31:56.497 --> 31:59.626
I know how to, but I can't, not--
Not from here.

31:59.709 --> 32:01.419
Call me back with a name.

32:01.502 --> 32:03.087
Sir, sir? I don't-- Sir? Sir?

32:10.219 --> 32:11.054
Okay.

32:22.523 --> 32:25.276
Yes. There you are.

32:26.444 --> 32:29.530
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

32:30.114 --> 32:33.701
Uh, not nothing. I needed to hack into
a company's website for a second.

32:33.785 --> 32:37.163
-On my computer? In my house?
-It looks bad, doesn't it?

32:37.246 --> 32:39.457
But my boss needs this information.

32:42.627 --> 32:43.795
Beck's on the move.

32:43.878 --> 32:46.589
-I thought you weren't with the FBI.
-I'm not, technically. Wha--

32:46.673 --> 32:48.132
It's complicated.

32:48.216 --> 32:50.093
It's not. It's simple, really.

32:50.176 --> 32:52.762
Get away from the computer,
or I'll have you arrested.

32:53.596 --> 32:56.724
-[cell phone buzzing]
-Do not answer that phone!

32:58.810 --> 33:02.563
Sir, I have a name. Chen Yu-Lan,
SCG's chief technology officer.

33:02.647 --> 33:06.484
Certainly, someone who would have details
to the company's manufacturing process.

33:06.567 --> 33:10.363
Couldn't steal the microchips so he goes
after the man who made them. Great work.

33:12.448 --> 33:15.868
All it takes is a little focus
and concentration.

33:17.495 --> 33:20.748
-Beck's following them out.
-Stop them. Move in now.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.250

33:27.839 --> 33:29.424
Get in the van! Let's go!

33:29.507 --> 33:30.466
Get in the van!

33:30.550 --> 33:32.468
Stop! FBI!

33:33.261 --> 33:36.180
Tell J. Edgar or whoever it is,
the more you try to stop me,

33:36.264 --> 33:38.850
-the more innocent people get hurt.
-[woman] No!

33:47.025 --> 33:48.276
[monitor beeping]

34:07.587 --> 34:10.131
[Cooper] Leave? You can't leave. Not now.

34:10.214 --> 34:12.925
I did what I came to do,
identified the Skinner.

34:13.009 --> 34:15.845
Who we now know has abducted
a man capable of mass producing

34:15.928 --> 34:19.140
the world's most advanced microchips,
as well as his wife and daughter.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.517
What's happening? What are you doing?

34:24.145 --> 34:25.730
Why are you doing this?

34:28.107 --> 34:30.276
Because I'm following orders.

34:30.359 --> 34:33.196
I was told to. If you're smart,
you'll do the same.

34:35.823 --> 34:37.658
[Raymond] <i>I don't know who his client is,</i>

34:37.742 --> 34:40.328
but if I were the Skinner, I'd think big.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.663
The superpowers
want to be self-sufficient.

34:42.747 --> 34:47.293
Who knows? It's possible some
government bankrolled this from the start.

34:47.376 --> 34:49.295
And you're just gonna walk away?

34:49.378 --> 34:54.342
I recently spent time
in a monastery above Boudhanath,

34:54.425 --> 34:58.596
with sweeping views of Kathmandu,

34:58.679 --> 35:02.809
meditating alongside 36 Tibetan monks.

35:02.892 --> 35:07.146
I achieved an inner harmony there...

35:08.731 --> 35:12.485
that was more mind-blowing
than any psychedelic,

35:13.444 --> 35:16.572
and yet more fragile...

35:17.573 --> 35:19.784
than an origami swan.

35:20.326 --> 35:22.745
It has to be cared for.

35:22.829 --> 35:24.372
If I stay here...

35:25.498 --> 35:27.500
it will be torn and crushed.

35:27.583 --> 35:29.836
Be honest, is this about inner peace

35:29.919 --> 35:33.589
or about my reluctance
to reintroduce you into Agnes' life?

35:34.423 --> 35:36.926
A reluctance I know you blatantly ignored.

35:37.009 --> 35:41.222
Yes. You have her watched.
That was a pleasant surprise.

35:41.305 --> 35:43.307
Nothing will happen to that girl.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.726
Not while she's in my care.

35:53.693 --> 35:55.069
She didn't see me.

35:58.447 --> 36:01.868
We need your help.
We can't find the Skinner without it.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.965
Keeping the girl from him is cruel.

36:16.048 --> 36:19.010
Is that what you want, to be cruel?

36:36.027 --> 36:37.486
[knocking]

36:38.112 --> 36:41.532
-I'm told you're feeling better.
-Hmm. I am.

36:41.616 --> 36:43.910
Mostly because I'm wasted.

36:44.744 --> 36:46.245
I think you're entitled.

36:46.746 --> 36:47.997
You look good.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.790
Sorry about your partner.

36:50.416 --> 36:51.334
Thank you.

36:53.002 --> 36:55.755
Are you all right? You look a mess.

36:57.173 --> 36:59.425
Okay, is it really that bad?

36:59.508 --> 37:01.302
Yeah, it's-- It's not great.

37:03.554 --> 37:06.349
[Dembe]
Was I hallucinating, or was Raymond here?

37:06.432 --> 37:08.184
He was, but he's gone.

37:08.267 --> 37:10.770
Gone as in, like, he's "gone" gone?

37:10.853 --> 37:13.272
-It seems so.
-[Park] Along with his resources,

37:13.356 --> 37:17.443
his contacts, his jet and any hope of
finding Skinner and the family he took.

37:17.526 --> 37:20.071
[Cooper] I don't know about that.
We know his real name

37:20.154 --> 37:22.240
and have a list of known addresses.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.575
-I brought you a dossier.
-Wait.

37:24.659 --> 37:27.828
A dossier that you copied
on Agnes' printer.

37:29.038 --> 37:32.416
The unicorn stationery,
that's a nice touch.

37:32.500 --> 37:35.002
Okay, yes, we are a bit ragtag.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.922
We're up against a well-financed
Blacklister with no budget.

37:38.005 --> 37:41.259
Or access to any databases
and no authorization.

37:41.342 --> 37:44.095
And you thought we were here
to cheer you up.

37:44.929 --> 37:47.932
Every two hours, an ICU nurse debrides me.

37:48.015 --> 37:51.394

<i>-She snips off dead skin with tweezers.</i>

37:51.477 --> 37:54.522
It's slow and painful.

37:55.898 --> 37:57.733
And it's the only way to heal.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.738
We all have dead skin.

38:03.781 --> 38:05.157
All of us.

38:05.241 --> 38:08.744
And healing will be slow and painful.

38:09.662 --> 38:10.871
But seeing you here,

38:11.455 --> 38:14.000
I can't think of a better way to start.

38:15.751 --> 38:18.713
So now what?

38:18.796 --> 38:21.632
We have a case to solve,
and no time to solve it.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.426
We start right away.

38:23.509 --> 38:25.511
I'll stay and bring Dembe up to speed.

38:25.594 --> 38:27.888
If you have anything
to rearrange in your lives,

38:27.972 --> 38:30.016
rearrange it
and meet back here in an hour.

-You went to his house?

38:49.285 --> 38:52.330
Sorry. If there's any way
I can make it up to you, Nick.

38:54.290 --> 38:56.625
You could drop your pants.

38:57.293 --> 38:59.086
Except, uh, maybe that?

38:59.170 --> 39:01.088
Mm. I'm serious. I need to see them.

39:01.172 --> 39:04.175
Stones, and I quote,
"The size of Montana."

39:04.258 --> 39:05.676
Uh, what are you talking about?

39:05.760 --> 39:08.304
Conroy. I don't know what you did,
but the guy was impressed.

39:08.387 --> 39:11.140
He said that?
He said that about my stones?

39:11.766 --> 39:13.142
That's not all he said.

39:13.684 --> 39:15.686
-He's in?
-He said he's intrigued.

39:15.770 --> 39:18.647
He wants to hear more. Like, now.

39:18.731 --> 39:20.149
-As in now?
-Yeah.

39:20.232 --> 39:22.777
As in our dreams are about to come true.

39:23.903 --> 39:25.696
Unless you have
somewhere else you'd rather be.

39:25.780 --> 39:30.576
No. Uh, yeah,
I wanted to talk to you about that.

39:30.659 --> 39:31.911
I do need to be some place.

39:31.994 --> 39:32.828
Hey.

39:33.621 --> 39:35.081
No, not yet.

39:36.165 --> 39:38.542
Yeah, long day, but...

39:39.502 --> 39:41.087
not at the office.

39:42.380 --> 39:45.633
I had a case... in the field.

39:45.716 --> 39:48.010
I should've told you. Sorry I didn't.

39:48.094 --> 39:50.304
I know how you feel, I do.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.223
But the family was abducted.

39:53.808 --> 39:55.851
No, it's not over.

39:57.144 --> 39:58.396
Not even for tonight.

40:00.689 --> 40:03.109
An agent is here, the bearded one.

40:04.485 --> 40:05.820
<i>♪ Head on ♪</i>

40:10.616 --> 40:12.868
This is the last place I wanted to be.

40:12.952 --> 40:14.286
And yet here you are.

40:14.370 --> 40:15.538
Please, sit.

40:18.833 --> 40:22.420
Liz, she knew all about
being where she didn't want to be,

40:22.503 --> 40:24.505
doing what she didn't want to do.

40:24.588 --> 40:26.132
Like running your empire.

40:26.757 --> 40:29.135
All she wanted was a life with Agnes.

40:29.885 --> 40:32.888
But the Blacklist changed her mind,

40:32.972 --> 40:36.308
knowing the world would be
safer with it than without it.

40:36.392 --> 40:38.310
That's why she agreed
to be your successor,

40:38.394 --> 40:42.273
why she gave up everything...
including her life.

40:42.356 --> 40:45.276
To protect it and keep it running.

40:46.694 --> 40:48.070
And then she died.

40:50.156 --> 40:53.659
And we walked away
and left the Blacklist to die with her.

40:56.370 --> 40:59.206
A life with Agnes wasn't all she wanted.

41:01.250 --> 41:03.335
She wanted a life with you.

41:06.297 --> 41:09.175
I know you don't need this.
I don't either.

41:09.258 --> 41:13.304
As painful as it was to walk away,
it's just as painful to come back.

41:14.638 --> 41:15.681
Maybe more.

41:16.390 --> 41:20.769
But the Blacklist was her calling,
and if we loved her, it has to be ours.

41:21.770 --> 41:23.230
That's why I came back.

41:23.314 --> 41:26.150
Because as much as I hate you,
I loved her more.

41:28.777 --> 41:31.030
His real name is Graeme Anderson.

41:35.534 --> 41:38.704
He was a foster kid,
bounced around until he aged out.

41:38.787 --> 41:41.540
<i>Two years unaccounted for,</i>
<i>then he does a year at Stanford,</i>

41:41.624 --> 41:46.754
where he becomes obsessed with the French
adventurer and smuggler Henry de Monfreid.

41:46.837 --> 41:49.173
Of course, a former Skinner.

41:49.798 --> 41:51.675
Why are you telling me this?

41:51.759 --> 41:54.887
Graeme Anderson
is the next name on the Blacklist.

41:54.970 --> 41:58.015
Your Blacklist, the one that Liz died for.

41:58.098 --> 42:00.601
Now, whether she died in vain
is up to you.

42:08.609 --> 42:09.985
I like him.

42:10.611 --> 42:11.779
He has a good soul.

42:12.696 --> 42:14.365
I believe he does.

42:16.617 --> 42:18.661
I'm less certain about mine.

42:21.789 --> 42:23.749
