WEBVTT

00:03.879 --> 00:06.465
Look, we all know Scully

00:03.879 --> 00:06.465
has the hardest head,

00:06.507 --> 00:08.258
but what concerns me

00:06.507 --> 00:08.258
is the speed factor.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.093
-Squad, listen up!

00:08.300 --> 00:10.093
-Not now, Terry.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.720
We're having an argument

00:10.135 --> 00:11.720
about who would win in a fight

00:11.762 --> 00:12.888
if we couldn't

00:11.762 --> 00:12.888
use our arms.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.306
Everyone agrees,

00:12.930 --> 00:14.306
I'd bite

00:14.348 --> 00:15.516
-the best.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.516
-Meaningless!

00:15.557 --> 00:16.600
True strength comes from

00:16.642 --> 00:17.935
the pelvis, not the mouth.

00:17.977 --> 00:19.269
There's been an assassination

00:17.977 --> 00:19.269
attempt!

00:19.311 --> 00:20.604
What? And you let

00:19.311 --> 00:20.604
us just sit around

00:20.646 --> 00:22.105
talking about

00:20.646 --> 00:22.105
Boyle's pelvis?

00:22.147 --> 00:23.148
I didn't let you!

00:23.190 --> 00:24.608
Councilman Bosworth was giving

00:24.650 --> 00:25.776
a speech at Garfield Plaza.

00:25.818 --> 00:27.152
He was shot in

00:25.818 --> 00:27.152
the shoulder.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.320
Now, he's in stable condition,

00:28.362 --> 00:29.613
but the shooter is

00:28.362 --> 00:29.613
still at large!

00:29.655 --> 00:30.739
We have to move!

00:30.781 --> 00:31.824
We're locking down a ten-block

00:31.866 --> 00:32.867
radius around the scene.

00:32.908 --> 00:33.993
No traffic in or out.

00:34.034 --> 00:34.994
We think our man is still

00:35.035 --> 00:35.953
inside the area.

00:35.995 --> 00:37.078
ESU is on site.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.163
I'll be leading the op from

00:38.205 --> 00:39.373
a mobile command center.

00:39.414 --> 00:40.666
Santiago is running

00:39.414 --> 00:40.666
perimeter control.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.041
Peralta, you're in charge

00:42.083 --> 00:43.251
of the manhunt

00:42.083 --> 00:43.251
for the shooter.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.253
Oh, my God,

00:43.293 --> 00:45.253
it's a manhunt.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.881
And I'm the Manhunter.

00:46.922 --> 00:49.466
And I'm your sidekick,

00:46.922 --> 00:49.466
the Boyhunter.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.176
-Come on, dude.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.176
-I'm gonna be on the news.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.012
I'm gonna look straight

00:51.218 --> 00:53.012
into the camera and say,

00:53.052 --> 00:55.430
"If the shooter is watching,

00:53.052 --> 00:55.430
I hope you like living

00:55.472 --> 00:58.017
between St. Charles Place

00:55.472 --> 00:58.017
and Connecticut Avenue."

00:58.058 --> 01:00.101
-I don't get it.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.101
-It's from Monopoly.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.854
That's where jail is.

01:01.896 --> 01:03.647
Whatever, it was a good line.

01:01.896 --> 01:03.647
Keep briefing!

01:03.689 --> 01:05.691
- [siren wailing]

01:03.689 --> 01:05.691
-[Terry] Diaz, Santiago,

01:05.733 --> 01:07.275
the command tent's

01:05.733 --> 01:07.275
on the northeast corner.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.569
We need to work fast.

01:08.610 --> 01:09.778
The mayor's only given us

01:08.610 --> 01:09.778
five hours

01:09.820 --> 01:11.071
until the barricades

01:09.820 --> 01:11.071
are lifted.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.155
Five hours? Tell him

01:11.112 --> 01:12.155
the Manhunter

01:12.197 --> 01:13.574
only needs one.

01:13.615 --> 01:14.867
Love that,

01:13.615 --> 01:14.867
but I'm gonna keep it at five.

01:14.909 --> 01:16.243
It's already way

01:14.909 --> 01:16.243
too little time.

01:16.284 --> 01:17.536
All right,

01:16.284 --> 01:17.536
I'm seeing security cameras.

01:17.578 --> 01:18.829
I need all that footage.

01:18.871 --> 01:20.581
I need forensics

01:18.871 --> 01:20.581
to run a full sweep of--

01:20.622 --> 01:22.875
Hey, what are all these

01:20.622 --> 01:22.875
civilians doing here?

01:22.917 --> 01:25.252
Who's responsible for

01:22.917 --> 01:25.252
securing the area, who

01:22.917 --> 01:25.252
screwed this up?

01:25.293 --> 01:27.046
Hi, I'm Officer

01:25.293 --> 01:27.046
Debbie Fogle.

01:27.086 --> 01:29.506
I'm so sorry,

01:27.086 --> 01:29.506
my partner's on

01:27.086 --> 01:29.506
crowd control.

01:29.548 --> 01:30.758
I don't know

01:29.548 --> 01:30.758
where he went.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.051
It's his first week

01:30.799 --> 01:32.051
on the job,

01:32.091 --> 01:33.552
so he's still

01:32.091 --> 01:33.552
learning the ropes.

01:33.594 --> 01:34.803
All right, listen, Fogle.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.013
We have a councilman

01:34.845 --> 01:36.013
in the hospital

01:36.055 --> 01:37.514
and his shooter

01:36.055 --> 01:37.514
is still at large.

01:37.556 --> 01:39.266
We don't have time

01:37.556 --> 01:39.266
for this incompetence.

01:39.307 --> 01:40.726
I want your partner

01:39.307 --> 01:40.726
off the case, what's his name?

01:40.768 --> 01:42.143
It's Raymond Holt.

01:42.185 --> 01:45.606
Oh!

01:42.185 --> 01:45.606
It's Dad--

01:42.185 --> 01:45.606
I mean, Captain Holt!

01:45.647 --> 01:46.565
I mean, Captain Dad.

01:46.607 --> 01:47.608
I mean, Officer Holt.

01:47.649 --> 01:48.984
I mean, Officer Dad.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.652
Yep, that was it.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.652
Officer Dad, I found it.

01:50.694 --> 01:54.281
[theme song playing]

02:10.672 --> 02:12.466
Detective, I thought

02:10.672 --> 02:12.466
I saw a clue on

02:10.672 --> 02:12.466
the sidewalk.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.635
I apologize for not

02:12.507 --> 02:14.635
properly securing

02:12.507 --> 02:14.635
the scene.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.470
No need to apologize,

02:14.676 --> 02:16.470
I wasn't even that mad.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.472
You said you wanted

02:16.511 --> 02:18.472
whoever messed up off the case.

02:18.513 --> 02:20.515
It doesn't matter.

02:18.513 --> 02:20.515
The point is, no one

02:18.513 --> 02:20.515
needs to get in trouble.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.101
Look, you don't

02:20.557 --> 02:22.101
have to pity me

02:20.557 --> 02:22.101
just because

02:22.142 --> 02:23.644
Madeline Wuntch

02:22.142 --> 02:23.644
demoted me for a year,

02:23.685 --> 02:25.186
I've been stripped

02:23.685 --> 02:25.186
of my accomplishments

02:25.228 --> 02:27.481
and lost the respect

02:25.228 --> 02:27.481
of everyone in my life,

02:27.522 --> 02:28.732
including my dog.

02:28.774 --> 02:29.900
Cheddar? No!

02:29.942 --> 02:31.693
Yes! Now,

02:31.735 --> 02:32.945
he only poops for Kevin.

02:32.987 --> 02:34.279
Oh, sir.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.489
We don't have time

02:34.321 --> 02:35.489
to take all this in,

02:35.530 --> 02:37.032
there's a shooter

02:35.530 --> 02:37.032
on the loose!

02:37.074 --> 02:38.700
Are you guys gonna be OK

02:37.074 --> 02:38.700
working together or not?

02:38.742 --> 02:40.661
Of course we will!

02:38.742 --> 02:40.661
I took an oath to

02:38.742 --> 02:40.661
protect this city

02:40.702 --> 02:41.954
no matter what my rank.

02:41.996 --> 02:43.246
I have no problem

02:41.996 --> 02:43.246
with Detective

02:43.288 --> 02:44.623
-Peralta being

02:43.288 --> 02:44.623
my commander.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.623
-And I

02:44.665 --> 02:45.624
have no problem

02:44.665 --> 02:45.624
commanding him.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.834
Here, watch this.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.543
Captain, will you

02:46.875 --> 02:48.543
please lock down

02:48.585 --> 02:49.962
North 3rd Street if that's

02:48.585 --> 02:49.962
OK with you, Captain.

02:50.004 --> 02:52.714
-It certainly is!

02:50.004 --> 02:52.714
-Impressed?

02:52.756 --> 02:54.633
You said "please" and you

02:52.756 --> 02:54.633
called him "Captain" twice.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.010
Yeah, we don't have time

02:54.675 --> 02:56.010
for this, Lieutenant.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.511
There's a shooter

02:56.051 --> 02:57.511
on the loose!

02:57.552 --> 02:59.054
Traffic is shut down.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.472
Civilians are being funneled

02:59.096 --> 03:00.472
into the checkpoints.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.890
Good, just wish my

03:00.514 --> 03:01.890
guys over here could

03:01.932 --> 03:03.308
be a little

03:01.932 --> 03:03.308
more efficient.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.518
Yeah, I'm looking

03:03.350 --> 03:04.518
at you,

03:04.559 --> 03:06.185
Detective Fuzzy Paws!

03:06.227 --> 03:08.981
Is this Amy-hates-dogs-Amy

03:06.227 --> 03:08.981
or Amy-extra-stressed-Amy?

03:09.023 --> 03:10.732
It's both Amys!

03:09.023 --> 03:10.732
I'm under a lot

03:09.023 --> 03:10.732
of pressure.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.484
And also,

03:10.774 --> 03:12.484
that dog is a

03:10.774 --> 03:12.484
piece of trash!

03:12.526 --> 03:13.861
-[dog groans]

03:12.526 --> 03:13.861
-OK.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.445
I can tell something

03:13.902 --> 03:15.445
else is going on,

03:15.487 --> 03:16.697
you don't have to pretend to

03:15.487 --> 03:16.697
be mad at the dog.

03:16.738 --> 03:17.823
First of all,

03:16.738 --> 03:17.823
I'm not pretending.

03:17.865 --> 03:18.824
That dog sucks!

03:18.866 --> 03:20.868
Also...

03:18.866 --> 03:20.868
[sighs]

03:20.909 --> 03:22.536
My period's late,

03:20.909 --> 03:22.536
I think I might be pregnant.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.287
-Oh, damn.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.287
-I can't be pregnant!

03:24.329 --> 03:25.914
Jake and I agreed

03:24.329 --> 03:25.914
to wait at least a year

03:24.329 --> 03:25.914
until we tried.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.290
I haven't found an OB,

03:27.332 --> 03:28.709
I'm not on any preschool

03:27.332 --> 03:28.709
waiting lists,

03:28.750 --> 03:30.127
and I spent all

03:28.750 --> 03:30.127
of yesterday

03:30.169 --> 03:31.503
in a room with Hitchcock

03:30.169 --> 03:31.503
and his new cologne,

03:31.545 --> 03:32.796
which can't be good

03:31.545 --> 03:32.796
for the baby--

03:32.838 --> 03:35.382
it is literally called

03:32.838 --> 03:35.382
Zika!

03:35.423 --> 03:37.676
OK, relax,

03:35.423 --> 03:37.676
You're probably

03:35.423 --> 03:37.676
not pregnant,

03:37.718 --> 03:40.303
it's entirely possible

03:37.718 --> 03:40.303
Hitchcock's cologne disrupted

03:40.345 --> 03:41.596
-your cycle.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.596
-Right, yes.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.724
That is a very real

03:41.638 --> 03:43.724
possibility.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.225
-Santiago!

03:43.765 --> 03:45.225
-Ah!

03:45.266 --> 03:46.643
What's going on here?

03:45.266 --> 03:46.643
Is everything OK?

03:46.685 --> 03:48.353
Yeah, totes! [sniffs]

03:46.685 --> 03:48.353
Right, Rosa?

03:48.395 --> 03:50.147
Uh, totes.

03:50.189 --> 03:52.066
Why is everyone

03:50.189 --> 03:52.066
being all weird today?

03:52.107 --> 03:53.567
Just get back to work

03:52.107 --> 03:53.567
and be normal.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.903
Yes, sir! Will do,

03:53.608 --> 03:55.903
we'll be normal.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.696
Nothing to stress

03:55.944 --> 03:57.696
about here.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.406
Hey, Fuzzy Paws!

03:59.447 --> 04:01.324
I'm paying you to work,

03:59.447 --> 04:01.324
not lick your butthole!

04:01.366 --> 04:03.410
Yeah, I'm gonna get you

04:01.366 --> 04:03.410
a pregnancy test.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.539
OK, I know you

04:05.204 --> 04:07.539
haven't done this

04:05.204 --> 04:07.539
in a while,

04:07.581 --> 04:09.833
so here's a tip--

04:07.581 --> 04:09.833
keep your hat on.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.793
Because of all

04:09.875 --> 04:11.793
the standing still,

04:11.835 --> 04:13.336
the pigeons think

04:11.835 --> 04:13.336
we're statues

04:13.378 --> 04:15.756
and they will poop

04:13.378 --> 04:15.756
on you or peck you.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.340
Both are bad.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.926
Thank you for

04:17.382 --> 04:18.926
the helpful tip.

04:18.967 --> 04:20.468
Oh, I've got

04:18.967 --> 04:20.468
ton of them.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.596
They're mostly about

04:20.510 --> 04:22.596
the dangers of standing.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.765
A year on the beat

04:22.637 --> 04:24.765
without prescription insoles

04:24.806 --> 04:26.850
can take two years

04:24.806 --> 04:26.850
off your life.

04:26.892 --> 04:28.476
Any way to speed

04:26.892 --> 04:28.476
the process up?

04:28.518 --> 04:29.853
[laughs]

04:29.895 --> 04:33.148
OK, I've got

04:29.895 --> 04:33.148
a funny guy for a partner.

04:33.190 --> 04:36.151
But seriously, you

04:33.190 --> 04:36.151
have to monitor

04:33.190 --> 04:36.151
your foot health.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.237
I'll gonna send

04:36.193 --> 04:38.237
you a pedometer

04:36.193 --> 04:38.237
app that I use.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.031
You're gonna love it.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.031
It has robust social features.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.783
We can give each

04:41.073 --> 04:42.783
other "foot-fives"!

04:42.824 --> 04:45.326
No, thank you,

04:42.824 --> 04:45.326
I keep count of my

04:42.824 --> 04:45.326
steps in my head,

04:45.368 --> 04:46.703
like a normal person.

04:46.745 --> 04:49.330
I'm up to 6,743

04:46.745 --> 04:49.330
for the day.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.668
OK Boyle, it's time

04:51.625 --> 04:53.668
for the Manhunter

04:53.710 --> 04:56.130

You got it!

05:07.849 --> 05:09.101
[scatting]

05:09.143 --> 05:10.602
OK, the bullet

05:09.143 --> 05:10.602
lodged there

05:10.644 --> 05:12.271
is 4 feet below the

05:10.644 --> 05:12.271

indicating a trajectory

05:12.312 --> 05:14.355
of about 15 degrees,

05:14.397 --> 05:16.524
which means the

05:14.397 --> 05:16.524

not here!

05:33.708 --> 05:35.669
Right. I'm just here

05:33.708 --> 05:35.669
in the plaza

05:35.710 --> 05:37.587
looking for, um...

05:37.629 --> 05:39.006
this!

05:39.047 --> 05:40.299
A half-eaten box

05:39.047 --> 05:40.299
of McNuggets?

05:40.339 --> 05:41.716
-Yup, it's my lunch.

05:40.339 --> 05:41.716
-Uh-huh.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.969
And what type of food

05:41.758 --> 05:43.969
is a McNugget?

05:44.011 --> 05:46.596
Some type of a...

05:44.011 --> 05:46.596
paella?

05:46.638 --> 05:48.098
You had to know

05:46.638 --> 05:48.098
that was a bad guess.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.058
Well, the point is,

05:48.140 --> 05:50.058
I needed my paella

05:50.100 --> 05:51.268
and I noticed

05:50.100 --> 05:51.268
the sky bridge,

05:51.310 --> 05:52.811
so I thought I might

05:51.310 --> 05:52.811
be of some help,

05:52.853 --> 05:54.395
but I'll just go back

05:54.437 --> 05:55.856
and stand next to a

05:54.437 --> 05:55.856
piece of police tape

05:55.897 --> 05:57.983
and do nothing.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.276
Wait, stop.

05:59.318 --> 06:00.319
How would you like

05:59.318 --> 06:00.319
to stick around

06:00.359 --> 06:01.736
and assist on

06:00.359 --> 06:01.736
the case?

06:01.778 --> 06:02.946
You sure, Jake?

06:01.778 --> 06:02.946
I mean, there's only

06:02.988 --> 06:04.489
room for one

06:02.988 --> 06:04.489
Manhunter.

06:04.531 --> 06:05.657
Boyle is right,

06:04.531 --> 06:05.657
I don't want to overstep.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.117
You're not overstepping.

06:07.159 --> 06:08.618
I mean, he interrupted

06:07.159 --> 06:08.618
the song, but whatever.

06:08.660 --> 06:09.995
Great, I'll just

06:08.660 --> 06:09.995
leave my paella

06:10.037 --> 06:11.913
on the ground,

06:10.037 --> 06:11.913
save it for later.

06:11.955 --> 06:13.790
We all know that's

06:11.955 --> 06:13.790
not your lunch!

06:13.832 --> 06:16.001
So, if the shooter

06:13.832 --> 06:16.001
was standing right here,

06:16.043 --> 06:17.585
a standard long gun

06:16.043 --> 06:17.585
would've ejected the casing

06:17.627 --> 06:19.171
right over...

06:19.213 --> 06:20.964
there, where Holt

06:19.213 --> 06:20.964
is already putting down

06:21.006 --> 06:22.090
an evidence marker.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.884
Yes, I found it

06:22.132 --> 06:23.884
quite quickly.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.677
Great, thank you for saving me

06:23.925 --> 06:25.677
the trouble of doing my job.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.304
Oh...sorry.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.181
Would you like me to pick

06:27.346 --> 06:29.181
the evidence marker back up

06:29.223 --> 06:30.307
so you can place it

06:29.223 --> 06:30.307
on the ground?

06:30.349 --> 06:31.683
-Yes!

06:30.349 --> 06:31.683
-No, of course not.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.060
Good work.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.769
[both] I bet the shooter

06:33.101 --> 06:34.769
went that way!

06:34.811 --> 06:37.480
-Sorry.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.480
-Yeah, it's OK.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.316
[both] Follow me to

06:37.522 --> 06:39.316
the service entrance!

06:39.358 --> 06:41.651
Ugh, we did it again.

06:39.358 --> 06:41.651
I'm so sorry.

06:41.693 --> 06:43.486
-It's really no problem.

06:41.693 --> 06:43.486
-Great!

06:43.528 --> 06:44.696
Follow me, everyone!

06:44.738 --> 06:46.573
Wait, what?

06:46.614 --> 06:48.033
Security footage showed

06:46.614 --> 06:48.033
no cars leaving the area,

06:48.075 --> 06:49.492
so our shooter must've

06:48.075 --> 06:49.492
left here on foot.

06:49.534 --> 06:50.785
He's taking over

06:49.534 --> 06:50.785
your case, Jake.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.079
You have to stop him.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.872
Well, you know,

06:52.120 --> 06:53.872
it takes a true leader

06:53.914 --> 06:55.290
to let someone else lead.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.333
Ugh, that sounds exactly

06:56.375 --> 06:57.709
like something

06:56.375 --> 06:57.709
I would say.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.086
Snap out of it.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.128
Look, it's fine,

06:59.127 --> 07:00.128
I just--

07:00.170 --> 07:01.504
I feel sorry

07:00.170 --> 07:01.504
for him, OK?

07:01.546 --> 07:03.006
His assignment was

07:01.546 --> 07:03.006
standing next to tape.

07:03.048 --> 07:04.258
I'm still gonna

07:03.048 --> 07:04.258
crack the case.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.842
-I cracked the case.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.842
-Come on!

07:05.884 --> 07:07.635
Hot dog man, tell<i> them</i>

07:05.884 --> 07:07.635
what you told<i> me.</i>

07:07.677 --> 07:09.971
I saw a guy,

07:07.677 --> 07:09.971
mid-height,

07:07.677 --> 07:09.971
brown hair,

07:10.013 --> 07:11.639
in a green hoodie

07:10.013 --> 07:11.639
with an owl on it.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.433
He had a big

07:11.681 --> 07:13.433
bag and he was

07:11.681 --> 07:13.433
running like hell.

07:13.474 --> 07:15.518
That sounds like our guy.

07:13.474 --> 07:15.518
All right, let's call it in

07:15.560 --> 07:16.561
to give a statement

07:15.560 --> 07:16.561
to the press.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.812
Great idea.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.149
He knows that I meant I would

07:19.273 --> 07:21.149
give the statement, right?

07:21.191 --> 07:22.442
And if the shooter's

07:21.191 --> 07:22.442
watching,

07:22.483 --> 07:24.152
I hope you like living

07:24.194 --> 07:25.695
between St. Charles Place

07:25.737 --> 07:27.322
and Connecticut Avenue.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.366
Because that's

07:27.364 --> 07:29.366
where jail is

07:27.364 --> 07:29.366
in Monopoly.

07:29.408 --> 07:32.286
A great line from

07:29.408 --> 07:32.286
a great man,

07:29.408 --> 07:32.286
or should I say,

07:32.327 --> 07:33.870
Manhunter.

07:33.912 --> 07:36.456
Yeah, he overstepped.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.752
Boyle, gather

07:38.292 --> 07:40.752
everyone up.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.380
Oh, we starting a

07:40.794 --> 07:43.380
burn book about Holt?

07:40.794 --> 07:43.380
Let's drag him, baby!

07:43.422 --> 07:45.590
-No, someone saw our hoodie guy.

07:43.422 --> 07:45.590
-Right, we'll do the

07:43.422 --> 07:45.590
burn book later.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.634
Attention, everyone,

07:45.632 --> 07:47.634
we have a possible sighting

07:47.675 --> 07:49.010
of our shooter on Hoyt Street.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.470
Detective Boyle and I

07:49.052 --> 07:50.470
will take Alpha unit.

07:50.511 --> 07:51.554
Smith, Fox--

07:50.511 --> 07:51.554
You guard the burn book.

07:51.596 --> 07:52.764
-Charles, no.

07:51.596 --> 07:52.764
-Stand down.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.224
You take Bravo unit.

07:54.266 --> 07:55.600
The rest of you,

07:54.266 --> 07:55.600
continue to

07:54.266 --> 07:55.600
sweep the area

07:55.642 --> 07:57.060
in case this lead

07:55.642 --> 07:57.060
doesn't pan out.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.853
The clock is ticking,

07:57.102 --> 07:58.853
go, go, go!

07:58.895 --> 08:00.647
Where should I go, Detective?

07:58.895 --> 08:00.647
I'd love to be of service.

08:00.688 --> 08:03.024
Captain Holt!

08:00.688 --> 08:03.024
I mean... dude!

08:03.066 --> 08:04.692
I haven't seen you since

08:03.066 --> 08:04.692
your big news conference,

08:04.734 --> 08:05.735
which I just loved.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.070
Ray, there you are!

08:07.112 --> 08:09.030
I can't believe

08:07.112 --> 08:09.030
you left your post again.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.699
Detectives, I'm sorry for

08:09.072 --> 08:11.699
my partner's bad boy behavior.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.243
I am not a bad boy,

08:13.285 --> 08:15.120
I'm trying to

08:13.285 --> 08:15.120
catch bad boys!

08:15.162 --> 08:17.080
If anything, I'm a good boy.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.166
That's exactly what

08:17.122 --> 08:19.166
a bad boy would say.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.084
It's definitely not, and

08:19.207 --> 08:21.084
no need to apologize,

08:21.126 --> 08:23.544
-we have a job to do.

08:21.126 --> 08:23.544
-Great! Where do you want us?

08:23.586 --> 08:24.963
Someone matching

08:23.586 --> 08:24.963
our shooter's profile

08:25.005 --> 08:26.673
was just seen over on

08:25.005 --> 08:26.673
Atlantic and 4th,

08:26.714 --> 08:28.175
I need you both there

08:26.714 --> 08:28.175
immediately, can you handle it?

08:28.216 --> 08:29.592
Absolutely not,

08:28.216 --> 08:29.592
it sounds like

08:29.634 --> 08:30.635
way too much

08:29.634 --> 08:30.635
responsibility.

08:30.677 --> 08:31.678
Don't listen to Debbie.

08:31.719 --> 08:32.637
We're on it!

08:32.679 --> 08:34.306
[Jake]

08:32.679 --> 08:34.306
All right. Bye!

08:34.348 --> 08:36.057
What's going on?

08:34.348 --> 08:36.057
The guy's on Hoyt Street.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.934
I know, I gave Holt

08:36.099 --> 08:37.934
a fake lead

08:36.099 --> 08:37.934
to get rid of him.

08:37.976 --> 08:39.478

08:49.237 --> 08:50.697
-Really? I don't hear it!

08:50.738 --> 08:51.656
Let's just go.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.492
OK, good news.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.492
I found

08:53.533 --> 08:54.742
a bodega in the

08:53.533 --> 08:54.742
containment zone

08:54.784 --> 08:56.161
and got a bunch

08:54.784 --> 08:56.161
of pregnancy tests.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.662
-A bunch?

08:56.203 --> 08:57.662
-Yeah. It's a New York bodega,

08:57.704 --> 08:58.830
you can't be too cautious.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.123
Good point.

09:00.165 --> 09:01.582
Yep, expired ten years ago.

09:01.624 --> 09:02.876
Open.

09:01.624 --> 09:02.876
And used!

09:02.917 --> 09:04.211
Made of gummies?

09:02.917 --> 09:04.211
Why?

09:04.252 --> 09:05.462
Weirdly vibrating.

09:05.504 --> 09:06.796
This is for teens.

09:05.504 --> 09:06.796
It's dark.

09:06.838 --> 09:10.008
-This is good.

09:06.838 --> 09:10.008
-Great, let's do this.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.926
Hey, Santiago, nice work

09:10.050 --> 09:11.926
at checkpoint one.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.803
Wait, why are you guys

09:11.968 --> 09:13.803
being all weird again?

09:13.845 --> 09:15.013
We're not being weird.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.223
Do not dab!

09:16.264 --> 09:17.516
I wasn't going to.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.933
I know what's

09:17.557 --> 09:18.933
going on here.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.643
-You do?

09:18.975 --> 09:20.643
-Yup.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.187
You're talking about me.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.980
I know because my daughters

09:22.229 --> 09:23.980
are doing the same thing.

09:24.022 --> 09:26.233
Every time I go in their room,

09:24.022 --> 09:26.233
they get all weird and quiet.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.942
It's 'cause they're

09:26.274 --> 09:27.942
making fun of Daddy.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.403
Is that what you're doing,

09:27.984 --> 09:29.403
making fun of Daddy?

09:29.444 --> 09:30.611
-First off--

09:29.444 --> 09:30.611
-Yeah, I heard it.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.072
-I'm sorry.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.072
-Great.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.323
Secondly, we're not

09:32.113 --> 09:33.323
talking about you.

09:33.365 --> 09:34.615
What are you

09:33.365 --> 09:34.615
talking about, then?

09:34.657 --> 09:35.867
Our favorite...

09:36.951 --> 09:37.869
porns.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.079
-What?

09:37.911 --> 09:39.079
-It's true.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.539
We have specific

09:39.120 --> 09:40.539
favorite porns.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.956
[whispers]

09:40.580 --> 09:41.956
And we're talking about 'em.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.458
-[whispers] Yeah.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.458
-OK, legally,

09:43.500 --> 09:45.544
I feel as though

09:43.500 --> 09:45.544
I need to back away.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.794
But I want it

09:45.585 --> 09:46.794
to be known

09:46.836 --> 09:48.422
that I still do not

09:46.836 --> 09:48.422
believe you!

09:48.463 --> 09:49.548
Get back to work!

09:49.589 --> 09:51.049
Eh, that went well.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.049
All right.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.384
Let's take this thing

09:51.091 --> 09:52.384
and get it over with.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.052
-I can't.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.052
-What? Why?

09:54.094 --> 09:56.137
I have no pee

09:54.094 --> 09:56.137
inside of me.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.264
I'm pee-free, Rosa!

09:57.305 --> 09:59.391
What do I do?

09:57.305 --> 09:59.391
What do I do?!

09:59.433 --> 10:01.642
-Drink water.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.642
-Oh, yeah. You're smart.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.644
You're a very good friend.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.644
I'm glad you're here.

10:03.686 --> 10:06.022
Street's clear.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.648
No sign of the shooter,

10:06.064 --> 10:07.648
where'd he go?

10:07.690 --> 10:09.401
-Shh, shh, shh.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.401
-Why are you shushing me?

10:09.443 --> 10:10.735
I'm doing that thing

10:09.443 --> 10:10.735
where I listen

10:10.777 --> 10:12.028
really closely

10:10.777 --> 10:12.028
for a noise clue,

10:12.070 --> 10:13.447
like glass breaking

10:12.070 --> 10:13.447
or trash rustling.

10:13.488 --> 10:14.948
Cool!

10:13.488 --> 10:14.948
Is it working?

10:14.989 --> 10:16.533
No, not yet.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.535
-Because I'm talking?

10:16.575 --> 10:18.535
-Well, it's not helping.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.328
-Right, right, right.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.328
I'll be quiet.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.328
-You don't have to say

10:20.370 --> 10:21.788
-you'll be quiet,

10:20.370 --> 10:21.788
just be quiet.

10:20.370 --> 10:21.788
-OK.

10:21.829 --> 10:22.997
I'm sorry for

10:21.829 --> 10:22.997
not being quiet.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.416
Once again,

10:23.039 --> 10:24.416
don't have to say.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.708
Just wanna be clear

10:24.458 --> 10:25.708
what I'm doing.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.043
Understood.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.043
I'm just gonna listen.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.045
OK.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.045
I'll be very quiet.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.798
Don't have to say it.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.133
Just wanna make sure

10:31.839 --> 10:33.133
you know what I'm doing.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.426
-Please stop.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.426
-So I don't throw you.

10:34.468 --> 10:35.594
OK, stop talking.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.095
-I'll stop talking.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.095
-Great.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.763
I'll make sure

10:37.137 --> 10:38.763
I don't do that again.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.432
All right, Charles,

10:38.805 --> 10:40.432
I love you, but you ruined it.

10:40.474 --> 10:41.475
[Dumpster clatters]

10:41.516 --> 10:43.518
[both] Trash rustle!

10:43.560 --> 10:46.062
He's running,

10:43.560 --> 10:46.062
call it in!

10:51.276 --> 10:52.819
[steam hisses]

10:52.860 --> 10:54.946
I'll follow,

10:52.860 --> 10:54.946
you cut him off!

10:56.364 --> 10:58.575
-[siren wails]

10:56.364 --> 10:58.575
-[tires screech]

10:59.409 --> 11:01.077
Damn it!

11:01.119 --> 11:02.078
[groans]

11:02.120 --> 11:03.871
Nice, Charles!

11:03.913 --> 11:05.248
Name's not

11:03.913 --> 11:05.248
Charles, it's

11:05.290 --> 11:06.333
Boyhunter.

11:06.374 --> 11:07.501
You know what,

11:06.374 --> 11:07.501
you earned it.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.544
Way to get your boy, Boyhunter!

11:09.586 --> 11:11.212
All right, let's get our perp

11:09.586 --> 11:11.212
back to the Nine-Nine.

11:11.254 --> 11:13.214
I'll tell Jeffords

11:11.254 --> 11:13.214
to lift the lock-down.

11:13.256 --> 11:16.134
Detective Peralta!

11:13.256 --> 11:16.134
I see you got the man

11:13.256 --> 11:16.134
you were looking for.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.637
With your help, Officer!

11:16.176 --> 11:18.637
I really couldn't

11:16.176 --> 11:18.637
have done it without you.

11:18.677 --> 11:19.887
No, this was all you.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.473
We were in a completely

11:19.929 --> 11:21.473
wrong location.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.475
Which was a huge

11:21.515 --> 11:23.475
relief to me.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.519
Plus, we got a

11:23.517 --> 11:25.519
lot of steps in.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.145
I'm drowning

11:25.560 --> 11:27.145
in foot-fives.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.855
Well, no need

11:27.187 --> 11:28.855
to focus on who was where

11:28.896 --> 11:30.689
or what a foot-five is,

11:30.731 --> 11:32.900
we gotta start brainstorming

11:30.731 --> 11:32.900
headlines for tomorrow's paper.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.902
I got one.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.902
"The Only Assassin in this City

11:34.944 --> 11:37.280
is Jake Peralta Because

11:34.944 --> 11:37.280
He Just Killed This Case."

11:37.322 --> 11:39.366
I don't know if we

11:37.322 --> 11:39.366
wanna make it seem

11:37.322 --> 11:39.366
like I'm the assassin.

11:39.407 --> 11:40.783
-Yeah, good thinking.

11:39.407 --> 11:40.783
-How about this,

11:40.825 --> 11:42.410
"Hero Cop Saves City,

11:40.825 --> 11:42.410
Pitt, Clooney,

11:42.452 --> 11:43.620
Circling to Play

11:42.452 --> 11:43.620
Him in Biopic."

11:43.662 --> 11:45.205
-Hunks!

11:43.662 --> 11:45.205
-I have a headline.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.415
"Pitt, Clooney Laugh

11:45.246 --> 11:47.415
At Jake Peralta

11:47.457 --> 11:49.125
For Arresting the Wrong Man."

11:49.167 --> 11:51.044
Well, I don't know if they

11:49.167 --> 11:51.044
would laugh at me for sav--

11:51.085 --> 11:53.171
What, did you just say

11:51.085 --> 11:53.171
I got the wrong man?

11:55.173 --> 11:56.591
What do you mean

11:55.173 --> 11:56.591
we got the wrong man?

11:56.633 --> 11:57.758
What are you

11:56.633 --> 11:57.758
talking about?

11:57.800 --> 11:58.968
You know how you sent Debbie

11:59.010 --> 12:00.303
and me off on a

11:59.010 --> 12:00.303
wild goose chase?

12:00.345 --> 12:01.804
Oh, so you figured

12:00.345 --> 12:01.804
that out?

12:01.846 --> 12:03.223
Well, Debbie did.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.223
She's quite the detective.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.558
Oh, I'm really not.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.558
I'm just

12:04.599 --> 12:06.309
always being given

12:04.599 --> 12:06.309
meaningless tasks,

12:06.351 --> 12:08.311
and I'm not complaining.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.021
So what, you're just saying

12:08.353 --> 12:10.021
we have the wrong guy now,

12:10.063 --> 12:11.814
because you're upset

12:10.063 --> 12:11.814
about the fake lead?

12:11.856 --> 12:13.525
No, I'm saying you have

12:11.856 --> 12:13.525
the wrong guy because you<i> do.</i>

12:13.567 --> 12:16.444
When I realized your lead

12:13.567 --> 12:16.444
was nothing but hooey,

12:16.486 --> 12:18.905
I went back to re-interview the

12:16.486 --> 12:18.905
hot dog man, but he was gone.

12:18.946 --> 12:20.657
And why was that?

12:18.946 --> 12:20.657
Debbie, tell 'em!

12:20.699 --> 12:22.075
Oh, no, I don't want

12:20.699 --> 12:22.075
to be a part of this.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.993
Because the hot dog man

12:22.116 --> 12:23.993
is the shooter.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.786
What?

12:24.035 --> 12:25.786
That seems like a reach.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.289
Sometimes, when you reach,

12:25.828 --> 12:28.289
you grab the truth.

12:28.331 --> 12:29.832
Sorry, Jake,

12:28.331 --> 12:29.832
he turned it around on me.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.000
-Come on!

12:29.874 --> 12:31.000
-The hot dog man

12:31.042 --> 12:32.085
gave a false statement

12:32.126 --> 12:33.044
to throw us off the scent

12:33.086 --> 12:34.254
and then vanished while we

12:34.295 --> 12:35.505
were off looking

12:34.295 --> 12:35.505
for the wrong guy.

12:35.547 --> 12:37.048
Face it, you're

12:35.547 --> 12:37.048
no Manhunter.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.509
If anything, you're a

12:37.090 --> 12:39.509
Wrong Manhunter.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.678
[gasps]

12:39.551 --> 12:41.678
How dare you!

12:41.720 --> 12:43.137
You know what?

12:41.720 --> 12:43.137
This is crazy.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.763
You're just making

12:43.179 --> 12:44.763
up a solve because

12:44.805 --> 12:46.391
you can't stand the fact that

12:44.805 --> 12:46.391
you got demoted.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.059
You've been trying to hijack

12:46.433 --> 12:48.059
this case all day.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.185
I was only trying to help.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.478
If I'm such a headache,

12:50.520 --> 12:51.938
then why didn't

12:50.520 --> 12:51.938
you reassign me?

12:51.979 --> 12:53.356
Because I felt sorry for you.

12:53.398 --> 12:54.899
I told you to

12:53.398 --> 12:54.899
treat me like

12:54.941 --> 12:56.025
any uniformed officer.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.277
It's not my fault that you

12:57.318 --> 12:58.403
don't know how to

12:57.318 --> 12:58.403
give an order!

12:58.445 --> 12:59.613
OK, fine!

12:58.445 --> 12:59.613
Here's one.

12:59.654 --> 13:00.988
We're lifting the lock-down,

13:01.030 --> 13:02.907
-go pick up cones.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.907
-Ooh, I love cone duty!

13:02.949 --> 13:05.034
Debbie, can it!

13:02.949 --> 13:05.034
We have the wrong guy.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.453

13:59.130 --> 14:00.089
Sure.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.093
happens to stop talking

14:04.135 --> 14:06.095

14:28.284 --> 14:30.036
Well, that ruined

14:33.623 --> 14:37.544
I unlocked a new accessory

14:33.623 --> 14:37.544

14:37.585 --> 14:39.045
Change of plans.

14:39.086 --> 14:40.797
We're not going back

14:39.086 --> 14:40.797
to the precinct.

14:40.839 --> 14:42.507
Are we gonna go rogue

14:40.839 --> 14:42.507

14:42.549 --> 14:45.426
Oh, we're going way more

14:42.549 --> 14:45.426

Listen, it's unlikely

-Great.

15:14.205 --> 15:17.124

15:17.166 --> 15:19.377
OK, the reporters are all

15:17.166 --> 15:19.377

15:19.419 --> 15:22.380

15:19.419 --> 15:22.380
-No.

Oh, are you worried

15:22.422 --> 15:24.465
about your voice cracking?

15:24.507 --> 15:26.259
-What would that entail?

-I'll just show you.

-Don't show me, tell me.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.369
I guess I owe you guys

17:56.826 --> 17:58.369
an apology.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.829
I may have been bringing

17:58.411 --> 17:59.829
some things from home

17:59.871 --> 18:01.163
-into the workplace.

17:59.871 --> 18:01.163
-Yeah!

18:01.205 --> 18:02.498
That was clear

18:01.205 --> 18:02.498
from the start, OK?

18:02.540 --> 18:03.583
Now, move,

18:02.540 --> 18:03.583
I need to find a bathroom.

18:03.624 --> 18:04.876
Stop, we have an emergency!

18:04.918 --> 18:06.085
Everybody stop

18:04.918 --> 18:06.085
what you're about to do.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.837
Yeah, but I gotta pee

18:06.126 --> 18:07.837
really bad.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.881
Well, hold it, Amy.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.881
Holt's not answering his radio.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.883
-I think he and Debbie

18:09.923 --> 18:11.883
might be in trouble.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.883
-It's just us, man.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.760
-You don't have to pretend

18:11.925 --> 18:13.760
to care about Debbie.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.760
-Rosa!

18:13.801 --> 18:15.344
What? We barely

18:13.801 --> 18:15.344
know her and she's annoying.

18:15.386 --> 18:17.137
She's always trying

18:15.386 --> 18:17.137
to get me to be friends with her

18:17.179 --> 18:19.432
-on that weird app

18:17.179 --> 18:19.432
for pedicures.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.432
-It's a pedometer app.

18:19.473 --> 18:20.892
It's a pedometer app!

18:20.934 --> 18:23.269
We can use the social features

18:20.934 --> 18:23.269
to track her!

18:23.310 --> 18:24.478
It's $80.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.563
Uh, Boyle,

18:24.520 --> 18:25.563
you should download it,

18:25.605 --> 18:26.606
you get better service here.

18:26.647 --> 18:27.899
Smart!

18:27.941 --> 18:29.108
And I'll upgrade

18:27.941 --> 18:29.108
to ad-free too.

18:29.149 --> 18:30.484
-Smart.

18:29.149 --> 18:30.484
-OK, let's move!

18:30.526 --> 18:31.986
Sweet!

18:30.526 --> 18:31.986
We're running, OK.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.238
If I die, will you look

18:32.028 --> 18:34.238
after my cat?

18:34.280 --> 18:36.074
I'm really more

18:34.280 --> 18:36.074
of a dog person.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.575
-I understand.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.575
-[door slams]

18:37.617 --> 18:39.911
-NYPD, nobody move!

18:37.617 --> 18:39.911
-You're surrounded!

18:39.953 --> 18:41.454
Don't do anything stupid.

18:41.495 --> 18:42.872
Looks like we got

18:41.495 --> 18:42.872
ourselves a standoff.

18:42.914 --> 18:44.540
Fine by us, we got

18:42.914 --> 18:44.540
all the time in the world.

18:44.582 --> 18:46.084
What? Uh-uh!

18:46.125 --> 18:47.209
I gotta pee!

18:47.251 --> 18:48.419
[growls]

18:49.963 --> 18:51.255
Perp secured.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.590
Great, OK, cool!

18:52.632 --> 18:54.216
I gotta go!

18:52.632 --> 18:54.216
You guys are good, right?

18:54.258 --> 18:55.718
Bye!

18:55.760 --> 18:57.386
Thanks for saving us,

18:55.760 --> 18:57.386
Peralta.

18:57.428 --> 18:59.472
Thank Debbie. We tracked you

18:57.428 --> 18:59.472
using her pedometer app.

18:59.513 --> 19:02.058
Oh, my goodness,

18:59.513 --> 19:02.058
I helped!

18:59.513 --> 19:02.058
[chuckles]

19:02.100 --> 19:04.894
And I got four new

19:02.100 --> 19:04.894
Foot Friend requests!

19:04.936 --> 19:07.814
What a day, guys!

19:04.936 --> 19:07.814
[laughs]

19:08.773 --> 19:10.108
[Holt]

19:08.773 --> 19:10.108
Detective.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.110
I believe I owe

19:10.149 --> 19:12.110
you an apology.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.987
No, Officer,

19:12.151 --> 19:13.987
I owe you one.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.321
No, I owe you.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.739
Great, 'cause I hadn't

19:15.362 --> 19:16.739
thought of

19:16.781 --> 19:18.198
what I was gonna

19:16.781 --> 19:18.198
apologize for yet.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.784
I should not have

19:18.240 --> 19:19.784
disobeyed your order.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.368
I was wrong.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.996
Not about the case, of course--

19:21.410 --> 19:22.996
my hunch was impeccable.

19:23.037 --> 19:24.204
Interesting apology

19:23.037 --> 19:24.204
strategy,

19:24.246 --> 19:25.331
a little heavy

19:24.246 --> 19:25.331
on the brags.

19:25.372 --> 19:26.666
Point is, you

19:25.372 --> 19:26.666
were right.

19:26.707 --> 19:29.127
I hijacked the

19:26.707 --> 19:29.127
case because...

19:29.168 --> 19:31.129
I need to feel respected.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.546
[sighs]

19:31.170 --> 19:32.546
Listen,

19:32.588 --> 19:34.132
it's weird that I'm

19:32.588 --> 19:34.132
your boss now,

19:34.173 --> 19:35.508
and that's not

19:34.173 --> 19:35.508
going anywhere,

19:35.549 --> 19:37.718
but no matter what

19:35.549 --> 19:37.718
uniform you wear,

19:37.760 --> 19:39.470
I'm always gonna

19:37.760 --> 19:39.470
love you--

19:39.512 --> 19:41.097
I mean, cherish--

19:39.512 --> 19:41.097
I mean, respect.

19:41.139 --> 19:42.389
-You said respect, right?

19:41.139 --> 19:42.389
-Yes.

19:42.431 --> 19:43.599
Yep.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.434
And I feel the

19:43.641 --> 19:45.434
same about you.

19:46.644 --> 19:49.355
So, do you have

19:46.644 --> 19:49.355
any orders for me, sir?

19:49.396 --> 19:51.273
Well, I do actually

19:51.315 --> 19:53.526
still need those cones

19:51.315 --> 19:53.526
picked up.

19:53.567 --> 19:54.694
We're on it.

19:54.735 --> 19:55.862
We got cone duty?

19:55.903 --> 19:56.988
Yes!

19:57.030 --> 19:58.031
Best birthday yet.

19:58.072 --> 20:00.491
It's your birthday?

20:00.533 --> 20:02.827
[Amy]

20:00.533 --> 20:02.827
Hey, so...

20:02.869 --> 20:04.912
today was

20:02.869 --> 20:04.912
pretty intense.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.539
You mean catching

20:04.954 --> 20:06.539
the shooter?

20:06.580 --> 20:08.082
I know, it's

20:06.580 --> 20:08.082
a great story.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.333
I just hope Pitt can get

20:08.124 --> 20:09.333
in good enough shape

20:09.375 --> 20:10.459
to play me in the

20:09.375 --> 20:10.459
movie, you know?

20:10.501 --> 20:11.669
Mm, yeah.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.588
Um, also, something

20:11.711 --> 20:14.588
else happened.

20:14.630 --> 20:17.091
I thought I might be pregnant.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.551
-Really?

20:17.133 --> 20:18.551
-Yeah.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.178
I'm not, I got

20:18.592 --> 20:20.178
my period.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.679
And I took a pregnancy

20:20.219 --> 20:21.679
test, but it didn't work

20:21.721 --> 20:22.972
because I drank

20:21.721 --> 20:22.972
11 gallons of water.

20:23.014 --> 20:24.724
Told you water

20:23.014 --> 20:24.724
was bad for you.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.433
-That's not the takeaway.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.433
-You're absolutely right.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.227
How are you, how do

20:26.475 --> 20:28.227
you feel? Are you OK?

20:28.268 --> 20:30.270
I mean, I was

20:28.268 --> 20:30.270
really stressed.

20:30.312 --> 20:34.025
This wasn't our plan,

20:30.312 --> 20:34.025
and we agreed

20:30.312 --> 20:34.025
we'd wait a year,

20:34.067 --> 20:35.860
and there's so much

20:34.067 --> 20:35.860
to do first,

20:35.902 --> 20:37.945
and it would've

20:35.902 --> 20:37.945
been crazy, right?

20:37.987 --> 20:39.405
Yeah, it would've been.

20:39.446 --> 20:40.531
OK.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.200
But,

20:42.241 --> 20:44.077
also might've been...

20:44.118 --> 20:45.578
kinda cool.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.371
Honestly...

20:47.413 --> 20:50.041
I was secretly bummed

20:47.413 --> 20:50.041
when the test came

20:47.413 --> 20:50.041
back negative.

20:51.834 --> 20:53.293
Should we just

20:51.834 --> 20:53.293
start trying?

20:53.335 --> 20:56.089
Seriously?

20:56.130 --> 20:58.549
Yeah, seriously.

20:58.591 --> 21:01.260
OK. Yeah.

21:01.301 --> 21:02.845
[both chuckle]

21:07.641 --> 21:09.185
Oh, wait!

21:07.641 --> 21:09.185
It's after 11.

21:09.227 --> 21:10.436
-[gasps]

21:09.227 --> 21:10.436
-My interview!

21:10.477 --> 21:11.520
