00:10.802 --> 00:11.803
Masha.

00:11.886 --> 00:13.096
Don't call me that.

00:16.141 --> 00:17.142
Your mother?

00:17.225 --> 00:19.185
You tried to murder my mother.

00:19.811 --> 00:24.274
<i>You lied to me about Reddington,</i>
<i>convinced me he was Ilya Koslov.</i>

00:24.357 --> 00:26.109
That woman.

00:26.735 --> 00:29.779
You abducted me for her.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.866
-How hard can I push him?
-You won't get away with this.

00:32.949 --> 00:35.118
-I asked you...
-[Liz] <i>The people looking for her</i>

00:35.201 --> 00:36.411
<i>-would not hesitate...</i>
-...how hard?

00:36.494 --> 00:39.456
...to hurt me or Agnes
if it would help them get what they want.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.082
And I didn't abduct you for her.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.960
I abducted you for answers
to make it stop.

00:44.043 --> 00:45.587
Help me understand.

00:46.463 --> 00:49.090
For the first time,
stop protecting Reddington

00:49.174 --> 00:54.095
and God knows who else, and make
the decision to protect your own family.

00:54.179 --> 00:58.016
Three generations of women
fighting to survive.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.906
[dramatic music playing]

01:13.615 --> 01:16.076
-Mr. Reddington, please.
-Take a swing, Eduardo.

01:16.159 --> 01:19.120
This is what you wanted.
Take your best shot.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.790
Because I assure you,
if you don't, I will.

01:21.873 --> 01:24.209
Please. I would never betray you.

01:24.292 --> 01:26.211
Come on. A nice big swing.

01:26.294 --> 01:29.255
I swear, I didn't know
your people were the target.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.674
If you won't hit me,
at least say something hurtful.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.426
How am I supposed to deal with this?

01:33.510 --> 01:37.305
You're so plaintive, I feel
like I should apologize for your betrayal.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.767
You know what, just help me track the van.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.728
Give me a VIN number, license plate.
Whatever you've got.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.605
You know what I've got. Nothing.

01:45.688 --> 01:47.524
My clients don't want me tracking them.

01:47.607 --> 01:50.485
But for you, if I had any idea
your people were in danger,

01:50.568 --> 01:54.697
I would've put a trace on the vehicle,
but I didn't because I didn't know.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.993
You're a good man.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.496
And I'm glad you didn't clock me
with a tire iron.

02:01.579 --> 02:04.541
I was thinking,
"Boy, that's really gonna hurt."

02:04.624 --> 02:06.584
[door opens, then closes]

02:06.668 --> 02:08.586
-Anything?
-[Dembe] Not yet.

02:08.670 --> 02:11.965
They must have a safe house nearby.
They weren't on the road for long.

02:12.048 --> 02:14.843
That's it? With all the sources
we pay for information?

02:14.926 --> 02:19.305
Everyone's looking, but wherever they are,
they know better than to show themselves.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.850
Dembe, Dom's too old.

02:21.933 --> 02:25.562
He'll try not to break,
but if they push him, he'll die trying.

02:26.771 --> 02:27.897
[Raymond sighs]

02:28.314 --> 02:31.943
I'm sorry about the theatrics.
I should've known better.

02:32.026 --> 02:34.821
I do hope I haven't made you
too uncomfortable.

02:35.738 --> 02:38.616
Take Kate to Argonne. Have dinner.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.868
A few laughs.

02:39.951 --> 02:44.205
I hear Chef Gilbert does a <i>ris de veau</i>
that will make your toes curl.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.749
Raymond, where are we going?

02:46.833 --> 02:47.959
We need a lead.

02:48.042 --> 02:50.920
If we don't have one,
we need to talk to people who might.

02:51.379 --> 02:53.131
Tell me. Where are we?

02:53.214 --> 02:57.677
So far, we're working two possibilities.
Uh, first is this man.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.889
A roadside camera picked him up
before the spike strip deployed.

03:00.972 --> 03:03.349
We believe he placed the strip
at Keen's instruction.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.852
-Can we enhance the resolution?
-[Aram] You're looking at it.

03:05.935 --> 03:07.896
-The plate's a fake.
-How will we find her?

03:07.979 --> 03:11.566
We circulate this image to merchants,
Metro PD, see what shakes loose.

03:11.649 --> 03:15.403
How do we do that without exposing Keen
to a kidnapping charge?

03:15.486 --> 03:16.738
My question exactly.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.532
Please tell me
we had better luck with the van.

03:19.616 --> 03:23.328
Not much. Surveillance shows it continued
north for another six-tenths of a mile.

03:23.411 --> 03:26.789
At that point, it turned off the main road
and took surface streets.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.208
To avoid any cameras.
Keen knows what she's doing.

03:29.292 --> 03:30.501
[elevator door opens]

03:32.337 --> 03:33.671
What do you want?

03:33.755 --> 03:37.133
Our help. He wouldn't be here
unless he needed something.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.718
Good to see you all as well.

03:39.427 --> 03:43.223
Like it or not, I believe
we're all pulling on the same oar.

03:43.306 --> 03:47.060
Harold, perhaps we could go find
a comfortable chair somewhere.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.854
[monitor beeping]

03:49.938 --> 03:51.940
[suspenseful music playing]

03:53.399 --> 03:54.817
What are you looking at?

03:57.737 --> 04:00.657
-You want to know if she's here.
-I know.

04:01.950 --> 04:05.370
Tell her to come out where I can see her.

04:05.453 --> 04:08.748
[Liz] <i>She's not hiding.</i>
<i>I asked her to let us talk alone.</i>

04:08.831 --> 04:11.376
I know you're not gonna
tell her the truth.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.630
I know a lot more
than the last time we talked.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.472
I know about the Sikorsky Archive.

04:26.182 --> 04:27.183
That's right.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.978
And N-13.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.522
Careful, Masha.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.985
Say N-13 around the wrong person
at the wrong time

04:37.402 --> 04:39.404
and you won't live to regret it.

04:39.487 --> 04:44.033
I told you not to call me that.
And I'm not the one in danger here.

04:44.617 --> 04:47.120
N-13 has the Archive, doesn't he?

04:47.203 --> 04:48.871
Assuming it is a "he."

04:48.955 --> 04:50.999
-Listen to me--
-It's Reddington, isn't it?

04:51.082 --> 04:52.041
He framed my mother.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.085
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

04:54.168 --> 04:57.213
If he doesn't have it, you know who does.
You're protecting someone.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.008
Who could be so important
that you'd sacrifice your daughter?

05:00.091 --> 05:03.094
My daughter. Some daughter.

05:03.177 --> 05:06.014
Don't lie to me. I swear,
it'll be better if you said nothing--

05:06.097 --> 05:07.515
That's enough!

05:07.598 --> 05:09.183
[beeping rapidly]

05:09.267 --> 05:11.269
You think I want this?

05:11.811 --> 05:14.981
To live with this? To die for this?

05:15.815 --> 05:17.900
To keep these secrets?

05:17.984 --> 05:20.069
Then stop keeping them.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.195
I can't.

05:21.279 --> 05:23.197
You don't understand.

05:23.948 --> 05:28.411
Whatever secrets I know,
they're not mine to tell.

05:29.454 --> 05:32.790
You don't have to believe me,
but if I die...

05:34.167 --> 05:38.212
I'll know I did my best
to protect you and Agnes.

05:38.296 --> 05:41.507
If you want to protect us, stop keeping
secrets that put us in danger

05:41.591 --> 05:43.551
and start telling us the truth!

05:43.634 --> 05:45.845
-[Clemons] He needs to be sedated.
-We're not finished.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.388
You are for now.

05:53.728 --> 05:57.482
You want information so you can get
to Agent Keen before we do.

05:57.565 --> 06:02.320
If history is any indication, you may
never get to Agent Keen without me.

06:02.403 --> 06:03.529
We'll take our chances.

06:03.613 --> 06:06.324
Really? With an old man's life at stake?

06:06.407 --> 06:09.327
A sick, old man in need of medical care?

06:09.410 --> 06:10.244
If he dies--

06:10.328 --> 06:13.247
If he dies,
it'll be no less your fault than hers.

06:13.748 --> 06:18.127
Imagine risking everything: her career,
a life with her child, her freedom,

06:18.211 --> 06:19.879
all to get answers you already have.

06:19.962 --> 06:23.841
Oh, come on. We've been over this.
She's gone way too far.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.719
Felony abduction, very possibly torture.

06:26.803 --> 06:29.222
She could kill the old son of a bitch.

06:29.305 --> 06:30.306
She wouldn't.

06:30.389 --> 06:33.059
What do you imagine she's doing, Donald?

06:33.142 --> 06:35.311
Saying, "Pretty please? Mother, may I?"

06:35.394 --> 06:38.147
I can tell you what she's not doing,
behaving like you would.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.441
Boy, she played you.

06:40.525 --> 06:44.278
She took advantage
of your rather significant blind spot

06:44.362 --> 06:46.739
in matters of the heart.

06:46.823 --> 06:50.034
-What does that mean?
-If this were the high school prom,

06:50.118 --> 06:53.079
she'd be the pretty loner
standing on the sidelines

06:53.162 --> 06:56.874
and you'd be the second-string quarterback
guzzling down the punch,

06:56.958 --> 06:59.585
hoping to cop a feel off her
during "Stairway to Heaven."

06:59.669 --> 07:01.671
-I've had enough of you!
-[Cooper] That's enough.

07:02.421 --> 07:03.422
We're done here.

07:03.506 --> 07:06.342
In fact, it's possible after this,
we're done period.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.804
If and when we find Agent Keen,
we'll let you know.

07:13.891 --> 07:16.602
-How'd it go?
-I placed it under his lapel.

07:22.525 --> 07:25.528
You want to release him?
[snickers] You can't be serious.

07:25.611 --> 07:28.406
-Look at him. He's unconscious.
-He's sedated.

07:28.489 --> 07:31.993
When his seizure subsides,
we can try again and again and again.

07:32.076 --> 07:35.621
-He's not gonna talk.
-Oh, he will. Not willingly.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.833
But he's too old to withstand
a more aggressive approach.

07:38.916 --> 07:39.750
No.

07:39.834 --> 07:43.421
You understood what we were doing.
We agreed not to stop--

07:43.504 --> 07:45.548
-Until what?
-Don't give me that look.

07:45.631 --> 07:48.301
I've been crystal clear
about how far I'm willing to go.

07:48.384 --> 07:51.345
-You agreed.
-I know what I said, but I can't.

07:51.429 --> 07:54.140
Not if it means torturing
an 80-year-old man.

07:54.223 --> 07:56.267
Whatever he's done,
he's still your father.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.352
-And my grandfather.
-So, what now?

07:58.436 --> 08:00.605
We can't just take him back
where he came from.

08:01.439 --> 08:02.440
Maybe we can.

08:03.107 --> 08:04.233
Let me make a call.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.278
Katarina.

08:07.361 --> 08:08.196
Mother.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.454
I need to know
you're not going to hurt him.

08:17.246 --> 08:19.040
You've never called me that.

08:20.082 --> 08:21.417
You won't, will you?

08:22.001 --> 08:24.003
[tense music playing]

08:30.468 --> 08:32.178
[line dialing]

08:32.261 --> 08:33.471
[rings]

08:34.055 --> 08:35.056
Ressler.

08:35.139 --> 08:37.266
-[Liz] <i>It's me.</i>
-[Ressler] <i>Where are you? You all right?</i>

08:37.350 --> 08:39.977
I'm okay, but this was a mistake.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.897
-Cooper's going out of his mind.
<i>-I need help with Dom.</i>

08:42.980 --> 08:46.859
<i>Equipment, medications.</i>
<i>Same place as last time.</i>

08:46.943 --> 08:48.736
I'll be there. Thirty minutes.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.991
We should have
Chuck and Morgan follow Donald.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.619
I want to know
as soon as they make contact.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.458
[suspenseful music playing]

09:03.960 --> 09:04.835
Is it done?

09:05.503 --> 09:06.504
He's conscious.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.090
The seizure has abated,
but I'm concerned that--

09:09.173 --> 09:12.927
I'm aware of your concerns, doctor.
You've made them very clear.

09:13.010 --> 09:16.514
No. You don't understand.
He's having some kind of episode.

09:20.351 --> 09:22.687
Lena! Lena!

09:23.563 --> 09:29.360
[in Russian]
I thought you were bringing my tea.

09:29.443 --> 09:32.738
He's been drifting in and out of Russian,
calling for a woman named Lena.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.157
-Do you know who that is?
-Lena Volkova.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.076
She was his wife.

09:40.037 --> 09:42.415
Dom? Can you hear me?

09:43.958 --> 09:45.376
Lena's not here.

09:47.461 --> 09:49.213
Dom, open your eyes.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.179
[in English] It's you.

09:59.515 --> 10:00.516
You're here.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.019
I'm here.

10:04.812 --> 10:06.814
He gave you back to me.

10:08.482 --> 10:11.485
I thought I'd lost you forever.

10:12.236 --> 10:14.071
[Dom sobbing]

10:34.592 --> 10:35.593
[Raymond on phone] <i>Any movement?</i>

10:35.676 --> 10:38.054
Negative.
He's still parked under the overpass.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.055
<i>How does that work?</i>

10:39.138 --> 10:41.891
Is he under an overpass
or in an underpass?

10:47.146 --> 10:49.440
Stand by. I got a car coming in.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.327
It's Agent Keen. She's walking to his car.

11:01.410 --> 11:03.788
<i>-What now?</i>
-Let's just wait and see.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.873
[tense music playing]

11:13.714 --> 11:15.091
-Keen--
-Don't say it.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.842
Don't say what, exactly,

11:16.926 --> 11:19.929
-of the 10,000 things I should say?
-Ressler.

11:20.012 --> 11:23.974
Don't commit felony kidnapping?
Don't betray everyone you work with?

11:24.058 --> 11:26.519
The only people who've proven
over the last seven years

11:26.602 --> 11:28.354
how much they care about you?

11:28.437 --> 11:30.689
It's done. I've made my choices.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.401
I'm not here
for your forgiveness or approval.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.361
What are you here for? Why'd you call me?

11:35.444 --> 11:38.364
To inform me you're torturing
your grandfather for information?

11:38.447 --> 11:40.282
You know me better than that.

11:40.366 --> 11:45.246
Do I? See, I thought I did.
But lately, you're full of surprises.

11:46.580 --> 11:49.667
He's in a safe house
in the warehouse district.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.919
[Ressler] <i>With your mother,</i>
<i>who shot him in the chest.</i>

11:52.002 --> 11:54.422
-[Liz] <i>She won't hurt him.</i>
-[Ressler] <i>And you believe her.</i>

11:54.505 --> 11:55.798
<i>You got it all figured out.</i>

11:58.300 --> 11:59.677
He had another seizure.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.930
<i>We need more doctors, advanced equipment.</i>

12:03.013 --> 12:04.849
[Ressler] <i>So, that's why you called me.</i>

12:04.932 --> 12:06.350
He needs more doctors?

12:06.434 --> 12:09.395
He has answers, all of them.

12:09.478 --> 12:12.731
I thought if he wouldn't talk to her,
he'd talk to me...

12:13.399 --> 12:17.111
have some human response
to his granddaughter pleading for help.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.113
And he said nothing?

12:20.739 --> 12:21.740
It's my mistake.

12:22.783 --> 12:25.786
<i>Whatever humanity he had</i>
<i>died a long time ago.</i>

12:26.370 --> 12:29.748
[in Russian] It's all falling apart.

12:31.625 --> 12:32.960
Everything.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.004
Gone.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.297
What's happening to him?

12:36.380 --> 12:37.882
It's common for seizure patients

12:37.965 --> 12:39.758
to experience delusions,
even hallucinations.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.470
-[Dom muttering in Russian]
-He's talking like it's years ago.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.305
He's lost any sense of time.

12:44.388 --> 12:46.348
I can administer an anti-psychotic.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.642
It may work to block
the dopamine and serotonin.

12:48.726 --> 12:49.560
No.

12:49.643 --> 12:52.188
-No? I don't understand.
-I want the truth.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.565
And I don't care
if he tells the woman I am now

12:54.648 --> 12:55.858
or the woman I was then.

12:58.736 --> 12:59.820
Papa.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.615
[young Katarina in Russian]
Thank God I found you.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.700
I'm in trouble.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.412
I need your help.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.502
[Ressler] Tell me where he is.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.880
I'll go myself with a transport van,
get him whatever help he needs.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.092
-What about my mother?
-Liz, this has to end.

13:22.176 --> 13:26.847
I know how Reddington wants it to end
or how it'll end if you go by the book.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.558
<i>Can't you ignore rules this time?</i>

13:29.642 --> 13:31.352
[Ressler] <i>Think about</i>
<i>what you're asking me to do.</i>

13:31.435 --> 13:35.231
She tortured Reddington, shot Dom,
abducted Dembe's imam.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.399
To save her own life and mine.

13:37.483 --> 13:41.946
Listen to me, you're on this quest
to find answers about your family.

13:42.029 --> 13:44.740
Well, I'm as close to family as you got.

13:44.823 --> 13:48.327
And I'm telling you,
if you don't stop protecting her,

13:48.410 --> 13:50.454
you'll end up destroying yourself.

13:52.873 --> 13:53.916
I'm sorry.

13:55.668 --> 13:56.502
Don't be.

13:56.585 --> 13:58.546
I shouldn't have put you in this position.

13:58.629 --> 14:03.425
You don't have anything to apologize for.
I would do anything for you if I could.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.096
But you can't do this.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.936
Now I'm the one who's sorry.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.901
[Chuck] Keen's on the move.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.194
Let her go, Raymond.

14:23.696 --> 14:24.905
Lock it down, Chuck.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.699
[engine starts]

14:31.245 --> 14:32.621
Ressler!

14:35.249 --> 14:37.251
[dramatic music playing]

14:41.171 --> 14:43.632
We're good here. Target's secure.

[suspenseful music playing]

14:52.141 --> 14:54.143
[monitor beeping]

14:55.019 --> 14:56.270
[in English] Listen to me.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.732
I know what you're planning.

15:00.357 --> 15:04.111
I know you think it's your only way out.

15:04.194 --> 15:05.279
[in English] What I'm planning?

15:06.155 --> 15:08.532
I know you're in danger.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.452
In danger? I'm being hunted.

15:12.286 --> 15:15.539
They will stop at nothing
until they find me and destroy me.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.959
We can handle the Cabal.

15:19.043 --> 15:22.796
You're not listening. It's Townsend.
They put a bounty on my head.

15:23.422 --> 15:26.342
-I have to run.
-No. You can't leave me again.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.385
[in Russian] I don't want to, Father.

15:28.469 --> 15:31.680
But they'll kill me. I've been framed.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.642
They think I have the Archive.

15:36.727 --> 15:37.728
Sikorsky?

15:37.811 --> 15:38.729
[in English] Yes.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.231
Yes! Help me stop them.

15:41.315 --> 15:44.193
Help me understand
why they think I took it.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.528
Because you did.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.781
What are you talking about?

15:49.281 --> 15:50.449
I can help you.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.035
But what you are planning...

15:54.453 --> 15:56.205
it breaks my heart.

16:00.292 --> 16:03.712
We know Katarina's holding Dom
somewhere in this two-mile radius.

16:03.796 --> 16:08.092
I want every building scrutinized.
See if they're occupied and by whom.

16:08.175 --> 16:11.387
Any abandoned buildings get top priority.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.347
I have six teams mobilizing.

16:13.430 --> 16:17.601
She chose this area because it's filled
with mid-sized warehouses.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.603
Here. These six blocks.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.146
Two dozen structures.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.816
That's where I'd go,
so that's where she'll be.

16:32.199 --> 16:35.661
-You followed me?
-Of course I didn't. I had you followed.

16:35.744 --> 16:39.206
Take it easy, Donald.
The veins on your neck are straining.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.542
You don't want a ruptured aneurysm.

16:41.625 --> 16:42.626
As for you...

16:43.711 --> 16:46.338
I can't begin to describe
my disappointment.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.464
Oh, thank God.

16:47.548 --> 16:50.676
Be disappointed all you want.
She's still a federal agent and so am I.

16:50.759 --> 16:51.885
You can't hold us.

16:51.969 --> 16:56.432
You and Harold, always telling me
what I can't do while I'm doing it.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.767
Why don't we split the difference?

16:58.851 --> 17:01.895
You go. Agent Keen can stay with me.

17:01.979 --> 17:05.482
-I won't tell you where she is.
-Then I won't ask.

17:05.566 --> 17:08.277
Run along, Donald. Call in the cavalry.

17:08.360 --> 17:11.864
I've got a head start.
The FBI won't find them before I do.

17:19.913 --> 17:20.789
Tea?

17:22.374 --> 17:25.252
You can't be on board with this.
He's out of control.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.256
Promise me he won't harm Keen.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.300
He won't.

17:39.224 --> 17:40.267
[cell phone rings]

17:42.019 --> 17:45.147
Do forgive me, Harold,
but I'm a little busy at the moment.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.357
I know what you're doing. Stop.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.401
<i>You're angry. Understandable.</i>

17:49.485 --> 17:54.406
I would be, too, if my agent snuck away
to have a secret meeting

17:54.490 --> 17:57.367
with the woman
my task force was searching for.

17:57.451 --> 17:58.869
That's for me to deal with.

17:58.952 --> 18:02.206
-Is it true you're holding Keen?
-What choice do I have?

18:02.289 --> 18:05.209
If I let her go,
she'll warn Grendel's Mother.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.836
Elizabeth's mother is not to be harmed.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.713
<i>And I agreed. Anything else?</i>

18:09.797 --> 18:13.258
-I'm not kidding.
-You don't sound like you're kidding.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.261
But you've always known
where this is headed.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.347
What she's done must be avenged.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.556
Not by her murder.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.101
When it's over,
I'll look up and see what remains.

18:22.184 --> 18:25.187
If there are any bridges,
I'll cross them when I get there.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.486
Get to the warehouse district.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.530
Bring Agents Mojtabai
and Park up to speed.

18:34.613 --> 18:37.199
It's a long shot,
but maybe we can find them first.

18:38.325 --> 18:39.451
[Katarina] <i>I need a name.</i>

18:39.535 --> 18:41.995
It's not enough to say I was framed.

18:42.079 --> 18:44.623
I need to prove who has the Archive.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.668
-You know.
-It wasn't me.

18:47.751 --> 18:49.419
Why are you saying that?

18:50.504 --> 18:54.133
It doesn't matter who took it.
What matters is who has it now.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.177
I need a name.

19:00.848 --> 19:04.560
Is it Reddington?
Is he the one you're protecting?

19:09.273 --> 19:10.107
Goodbye, Papa.

19:10.190 --> 19:13.026
-No! Don't go.
-I have to go!

19:13.777 --> 19:17.531
They're coming for me. They're close.
If I don't leave now, they'll kill us all.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.202
Reddington.

19:23.745 --> 19:25.330
Reddington. He has the Archive?

19:25.414 --> 19:26.456
Yes.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.252
You took it, but he has it.

19:31.211 --> 19:32.671
And so do you.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.381
We both have it?

19:35.215 --> 19:37.885
How is that possible?
Tell me what you mean.

19:40.929 --> 19:43.307
Tell me now or you won't see me again.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.524
[footsteps approaching]

20:02.451 --> 20:04.244
How long have you been helping her?

20:06.288 --> 20:08.457
That's how you know about Ilya, isn't it?

20:08.540 --> 20:11.418
You were there
when she was questioning him.

20:11.501 --> 20:12.920
Helped her get away.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.466
You know you can't trust
that woman, right?

20:17.549 --> 20:19.134
That woman is my mother.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.262
No, she's just using that to exploit you.

20:23.513 --> 20:24.348
Why?

20:24.431 --> 20:27.559
So, you'd do exactly
what you've already done.

20:30.270 --> 20:32.648
I know about the Sikorsky Archive.

20:34.733 --> 20:37.361
That's why
the Townsend Directive was issued.

20:37.444 --> 20:38.862
She was framed.

20:38.946 --> 20:41.031
[Raymond] Is that the story she told you?

20:42.032 --> 20:45.285
She's a victim,
an innocent wrongly accused?

20:46.578 --> 20:47.955
Are you N-13?

20:50.540 --> 20:52.918
Because she certainly believes you are.

20:56.838 --> 20:57.839
Do you have it?

20:59.007 --> 21:00.008
The Archive?

21:00.092 --> 21:02.177
I see. So, this is a ghost story.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.221
And you believe her.

21:04.304 --> 21:06.014
What choice do I have?

21:07.516 --> 21:11.144
She's the one looking for answers.
You're the one hiding them.

21:14.064 --> 21:16.525
Maybe she's not telling me everything.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.403
Do I still have questions? Of course.

21:22.239 --> 21:25.033
For now, the only one
I need to answer is this:

21:25.867 --> 21:27.869
"Am I willing to let you kill her?"

21:29.454 --> 21:30.706
And the answer is no.

I told her.

I don't think we'll find that warehouse

[woman] You can check the purchase order
tomorrow when they're in the office.

27:38.156 --> 27:40.033
Will do. Have a good night, Carol.

27:46.414 --> 27:47.707
-Carol?
-Yes?

27:47.791 --> 27:50.377
Hi. I'm sorry, do we know each other?

27:50.460 --> 27:52.045
I thought that was you.

27:52.128 --> 27:55.340
Donna Hays. We met a few weeks ago
at John Adams.

27:56.049 --> 27:59.094
-Right, Donna. How are you?
-So good.

27:59.177 --> 28:02.055
Sorry. Remind me again
how you're connected to--

28:02.138 --> 28:04.099
The keys. Give me your keys.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.935
-Cover the exit.

28:32.669 --> 28:33.795
Reddington.

28:43.179 --> 28:46.474
You can try and spread the blame around,
but this is on you.

28:46.558 --> 28:49.102
Keen was looking for answers,
answers that you have.

28:49.728 --> 28:53.022
If anyone's responsible
for this man's death, it's you.

29:14.252 --> 29:15.628
You're probably right.

29:25.263 --> 29:27.265
[dramatic music playing]

29:31.227 --> 29:33.021
Dom's dead, Dembe.

29:35.523 --> 29:36.357
No.

29:36.441 --> 29:37.567
<i>He's dead.</i>

29:39.486 --> 29:40.904
And she's gone.

29:42.489 --> 29:43.948
Raymond, I'm sorry.

29:44.032 --> 29:45.492
<i>She knows everything.</i>

29:45.575 --> 29:46.826
We have to find her.

29:46.910 --> 29:51.664
We have a plate number for the car
she's driving. It won't last long.

29:51.748 --> 29:54.793
-If she does know--
-There's only one move she can make.

29:54.876 --> 29:56.544
Our best chance is to intercept it.

29:56.628 --> 29:57.879
That's dangerous.

29:57.962 --> 29:59.631
<i>I have Chuck and the others.</i>

29:59.714 --> 30:01.257
I should be with you.

30:01.341 --> 30:03.635
Take Elizabeth to the apartment.
Hold her there.

30:03.718 --> 30:05.386
I'll call you when this part's done.

[cell phone beeps]

-Negative. Nothing on the schedule.

Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:36.084 --> 30:37.961
Roll down your window, sir.

30:40.046 --> 30:41.840
Hey, we got a wise guy here.

30:43.383 --> 30:44.217
Open up.

[gunshots]

30:59.816 --> 31:00.984
Mr. Heidegger's office.

31:01.067 --> 31:02.527
Mr. Heidegger, please.

31:02.610 --> 31:04.988
Sorry, he's not in right now.
Can I take a message?

31:05.071 --> 31:08.199
It's urgent that I speak with him.
A personal emergency.

31:08.283 --> 31:11.035
<i>-May I ask who's calling?</i>
-Katarina Rostova.

31:11.786 --> 31:14.831
-I'm sorry, could you--?
-You heard me. Put him on the line.

31:17.333 --> 31:20.044
I understand. We all thought so, Susan.

31:22.380 --> 31:25.174
No, you did the right thing,
calling me at home.

31:25.675 --> 31:27.051
Go ahead and put her through.

31:28.970 --> 31:29.971
[phone beeps]

31:31.306 --> 31:33.808
This is Heidegger. To whom am I speaking?

31:33.892 --> 31:36.978
You already know.
That's why you took the call.

31:37.061 --> 31:39.439
Dear lady, I don't know
who you think you've reached,

31:39.522 --> 31:41.316
but there's been some misunderstanding.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.276
You're William Heidegger.

31:43.359 --> 31:46.613
The highest-ranking representative
of the Townsend Organization

31:46.696 --> 31:48.531
<i>in the Western hemisphere.</i>

31:48.615 --> 31:50.325
Whoever I am is irrelevant.

31:51.117 --> 31:52.911
Katarina Rostova is dead.

31:52.994 --> 31:56.956
You believe the Kazanjian Brothers
killed me because that's what I wanted.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.207
<i>It was a good plan.</i>

31:58.291 --> 32:00.627
<i>Tricked Townsend into paying</i>
<i>the bounty on my head,</i>

32:00.710 --> 32:03.212
part of which I used
to prove my innocence.

32:03.296 --> 32:06.382
Assuming, for the sake of discussion,
you are who you claim to be,

32:07.383 --> 32:09.260
what proof could you possibly have?

32:10.178 --> 32:12.347
I have the identity of N-13.

32:13.681 --> 32:15.266
You're N-13.

32:15.350 --> 32:16.225
No.

32:17.977 --> 32:19.395
But I know who is.

32:19.479 --> 32:23.399
And I'm willing to give you his name
in exchange for my safety.

32:27.236 --> 32:30.114
There's a park on the corner
of Wabash and Grant.

32:30.198 --> 32:32.367
I take my granddaughter there
to feed the ducks.

32:32.450 --> 32:35.328
<i>-West benches. Will that do?</i>
-I'll be there.

32:41.542 --> 32:42.835
Well done, William.

32:42.919 --> 32:44.462
You won't survive this.

32:44.545 --> 32:46.422
I appreciate your concern.

32:46.506 --> 32:49.133
Oddly enough, I was about to say
the same thing to you.

32:56.224 --> 32:57.308
[cell phone ringing]

33:01.020 --> 33:02.855
-Raymond.
-We were right.

33:02.939 --> 33:04.649
She reached out to Heidegger.

33:04.732 --> 33:07.276
Set a meeting. I'll text you the address.

33:12.865 --> 33:13.950
Is it done?

33:15.368 --> 33:16.411
Did he kill her?

33:20.748 --> 33:22.250
I know you won't help me,

33:22.333 --> 33:24.335
but you could at least have
the decency to tell me

33:24.419 --> 33:26.295
whether or not my mother's dead.

33:29.215 --> 33:30.967
I know you're loyal to him.

33:31.050 --> 33:33.720
And I'm not asking you to be disloyal.

33:35.805 --> 33:37.640
But I do have a right to know.

33:40.601 --> 33:43.396
Your grandfather, Dom...

33:44.897 --> 33:46.190
he passed.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.031
I'm sorry.

33:57.243 --> 33:59.245
You asked why I'm helping Raymond.

34:00.079 --> 34:02.999
I said I didn't know anymore,
but that's not true.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.884
[dramatic music playing]

34:16.721 --> 34:21.434
I know it seems like Raymond
can be selfish and sometimes cruel.

34:21.517 --> 34:22.643
"Sometimes"?

34:24.645 --> 34:26.773
He's killed everyone
I've ever cared about.

34:27.565 --> 34:30.193
My father. My husband. My grandfather.

34:30.276 --> 34:33.946
Now you're dropping me off, why,
so you can help him kill my mother?

34:34.030 --> 34:37.658
-It isn't what it appears to be.
-I was always glad you were in his life.

34:38.326 --> 34:42.914
He had a better angel
that might influence his behavior.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.291
But now I know you're not.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.293
You can't.

34:48.044 --> 34:49.962
You're no better than he is.

34:54.675 --> 34:55.927
I can't anymore.

34:57.095 --> 34:57.970
I'm done.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.018
I can't fight him anymore.

35:06.521 --> 35:07.522
He wins.

35:09.774 --> 35:10.817
He always wins.

35:35.341 --> 35:37.051
He's not gonna win this time.

Before you get any ideas, I have teams
watching from every angle and I'm armed.

36:24.974 --> 36:26.893
Reddington is N-13.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.395
He has the Archive.

36:30.062 --> 36:32.273
He's the one you've been looking for.

36:35.484 --> 36:36.569
Say something.

36:39.071 --> 36:40.072
Did you hear me?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.826
[Raymond] No, I don't believe he did.

36:50.124 --> 36:50.958
The pistol.

37:03.971 --> 37:05.139
Dominic's dead.

37:07.183 --> 37:08.893
He wasn't when I left him.

37:09.727 --> 37:14.023
No matter. You killed him just as sure
as I killed poor Heidegger there.

37:15.483 --> 37:18.027
Am I supposed
to feel something about that?

37:18.819 --> 37:23.574
Dom set me up, led me to what was
supposed to be my public slaughter.

37:24.700 --> 37:27.995
Think what you want, but I won't be
shedding any tears for that monster.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.872
No, I wouldn't think so.

That's where he's meeting her.
Send units there now.

38:17.628 --> 38:20.548
Done. But you gotta realize
the best-case scenario here

38:20.631 --> 38:21.924
is we arrest her.

38:22.008 --> 38:24.468
Then arrest her. Just get there now.

-Where are you?

You gotta stop him.

and you were right
in front of me the whole time.

For what it's worth, I didn't know
what Dom was planning in Belgrade.

38:38.441 --> 38:39.650
I believe you.

38:39.734 --> 38:40.985
But after...

38:41.861 --> 38:43.946
you let the world believe the lie.

38:44.030 --> 38:48.701
You dangled me out there,
let everyone think I had the Archive.

38:50.369 --> 38:51.620
And now I know why.

38:52.455 --> 38:56.208
If they were chasing me,
it meant they weren't chasing you.

38:56.792 --> 38:58.419
It's not quite that simple.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.504
You're N-13, aren't you?

39:00.588 --> 39:03.716
You framed me.
You fed me to Townsend as a patsy,

39:03.799 --> 39:06.052
and Dominic knew and helped you do it.

39:06.135 --> 39:07.011

I just talked with Agent Ressler

-Kill Agent Keen's mother.

Well, that would be
