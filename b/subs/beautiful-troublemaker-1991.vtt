01:33.182 --> 01:35.222
- You want some coffee?
- No, thank you.

01:35.435 --> 01:39.513
I've just had my breakfast
at the hotel. 2 croissants.

02:15.846 --> 02:17.969
I could've said: "I've just shit."

02:18.182 --> 02:20.340
You'd be just as interested.

02:20.558 --> 02:23.513
I really find you interesting.
There's no need to...

02:23.728 --> 02:26.349
Look me in the face.

02:27.357 --> 02:29.730
That's the only thing you forgot.

02:30.650 --> 02:31.682
Help me.

02:32.653 --> 02:33.733
Look out!

02:34.489 --> 02:37.157
The way you work is your business...

02:38.491 --> 02:39.358
Let me be myself.

02:39.577 --> 02:40.987
You watch out for the painting!

02:41.745 --> 02:44.700
Let me find...

02:46.082 --> 02:47.197
my own place...

02:47.793 --> 02:49.287
my way of moving...

02:50.086 --> 02:51.081
my timing.

02:55.883 --> 02:58.457
If you don't like it, we'll stop.

04:08.908 --> 04:11.744
When I came here for the first time...

04:12.455 --> 04:14.860
I thought of
my boarding-school chapel.

04:22.506 --> 04:25.920
I felt very bad at school...
and well at the same time.

04:26.175 --> 04:27.967
Everything was forbidden.

04:31.013 --> 04:32.805
I was ill all the time.

04:38.811 --> 04:40.720
Each morning I wanted to stay...

04:40.980 --> 04:43.553
crouched in bed.

04:44.734 --> 04:47.060
Terrible fevers...

04:47.987 --> 04:49.101
Like that...

05:01.165 --> 05:02.281
Where are you?

05:03.542 --> 05:04.622
I'm here.

05:07.339 --> 05:08.832
Listening... Watching...

05:16.181 --> 05:19.346
Finally they got fed up
and threw me out.

05:22.726 --> 05:24.269
Why should I go on now?

05:27.065 --> 05:29.021
It's not exactly the same.

05:31.153 --> 05:31.983
No...

05:36.200 --> 05:37.573
but the fever...

05:38.700 --> 05:40.990
is back. All night long.

05:43.329 --> 05:44.907
It's like before Nicolas.

05:50.671 --> 05:52.542
Nightmares...

05:53.839 --> 05:56.757
Nicolas did nothing for you?

05:59.344 --> 06:02.714
He hates me.
He thinks I'm crazy about you.

06:04.808 --> 06:06.137
He's a bloody fool.

06:07.101 --> 06:09.474
A fool and a bastard.

06:09.896 --> 06:11.638
But first of all a fool.

06:11.897 --> 06:14.768
No, first of all a bloody bastard.

06:16.359 --> 06:17.818
After all, I don't know.

06:22.699 --> 06:26.282
Anyway, this is all his fault.

06:26.661 --> 06:28.204
And also mine.

06:28.413 --> 06:29.872
No...

06:30.416 --> 06:32.703
He just needed a pretext.

06:37.462 --> 06:41.210
It isn't true, I'm unfair.

06:42.592 --> 06:46.424
I think he's proud to have
something to do with your work.

06:46.639 --> 06:48.216
Something like that.

06:51.142 --> 06:52.720
He didn't realize...

06:53.352 --> 06:55.097
he could blow everything.

06:55.314 --> 06:57.269
Why? There's no reason...

06:58.899 --> 07:00.773
Stop pretending.

07:03.319 --> 07:04.353
As a cat in front...

07:04.573 --> 07:05.566
of a bird.

07:21.170 --> 07:22.166
What is it?

07:23.798 --> 07:25.754
Nothing... continue.

07:26.425 --> 07:27.800
Continue what?

07:30.219 --> 07:32.508
I'm telling you my life's
coming to a stop.

07:33.556 --> 07:36.510
Everything's over
between Nicolas and me...

07:38.521 --> 07:40.845
and I don't even know
how it happened.

07:50.781 --> 07:53.402
He's the only man I could live with.

07:55.786 --> 07:58.359
Others, I spit in their faces.

07:58.914 --> 08:00.371
Including you.

08:04.877 --> 08:06.252
What violence...

08:08.590 --> 08:12.633
That's it. Now make fun of me.

08:14.136 --> 08:16.970
I don't care about you with Liz...

08:18.266 --> 08:19.722
but Nicolas...

08:28.484 --> 08:29.229
Stay away!

08:29.441 --> 08:32.063
But why did you move?
The gesture, the look...

08:32.278 --> 08:34.150
they were just fine...

09:04.808 --> 09:07.809
I've almost finished. It's a rook.

09:09.436 --> 09:12.106
Our delicious crow...

09:13.399 --> 09:16.187
And this is the famous poison.

09:16.402 --> 09:18.477
Take it easy. I don't use it.

09:19.154 --> 09:21.907
I keep it because it's old and nice.

09:26.369 --> 09:27.994
A green neck...

09:28.579 --> 09:31.664
A painting by Oudry, one could say.

09:34.169 --> 09:35.995
I think there's one like this...

09:36.211 --> 09:38.583
in the Musee Fabre, by the stairs.

09:42.010 --> 09:43.419
The head down...

09:45.679 --> 09:48.169
It's true, animals also pose.

09:57.981 --> 09:59.524
Tell me something.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.525
Did you know about Frenho?

10:02.736 --> 10:04.195
What about him?

10:05.823 --> 10:07.482
You understood...

10:07.699 --> 10:10.866
he wanted to start again
with the Noiseuse,

10:11.078 --> 10:12.405
with the girl.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.457
He told you that?

10:18.250 --> 10:21.667
So what? That's the best thing
that could happen.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.159
I don't know.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.999
He got so downhearted
the first time.

10:30.304 --> 10:32.628
You can't always protect yourself.

10:34.975 --> 10:36.967
It's decent of you to say that.

10:38.103 --> 10:39.894
For you it's easy.

10:40.104 --> 10:42.940
When it's all over
you come to collect the pieces.

10:43.149 --> 10:45.556
Except when it's me on the floor.

10:46.194 --> 10:48.020
It happened to me.

10:48.236 --> 10:49.398
Last time at dinner.

10:49.613 --> 10:52.282
Not that.
You know very well what I mean.

10:52.742 --> 10:55.945
- Let bygones be bygones... Balto.
- Don't call me Balto.

10:56.953 --> 10:58.412
There's no more Balto.

11:04.710 --> 11:08.494
Did he tell you about the painting?
You saw it?

11:09.840 --> 11:11.121
Just a little bit.

11:11.342 --> 11:12.670
What do you mean?

11:13.926 --> 11:15.552
I hate you.

11:16.013 --> 11:17.886
You've come because of that.

11:18.098 --> 11:20.507
Just to know how it's going.

11:21.642 --> 11:24.098
A friendly visit, my foot!

11:24.312 --> 11:26.636
For hypocrisy you're the best.

11:27.856 --> 11:29.055
Stop it.

11:29.275 --> 11:32.192
I could've phoned, but I'm here.

11:35.573 --> 11:37.316
I felt like seeing you.

11:39.325 --> 11:40.702
You know very well...

11:41.494 --> 11:43.617
So why aren't you staying
for dinner?

11:44.791 --> 11:47.576
I don't want to see him
until he finishes.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.913
And I have to be in Grenoble tonight.

11:54.466 --> 11:57.299
You think he's on the right track?

11:57.842 --> 12:00.215
Get the fuck out or I'll stuff you.

12:00.512 --> 12:01.675
As you wish.

12:05.975 --> 12:09.559
Don't forget. On Saturday
I'm coming, whatever happens.

12:10.521 --> 12:13.226
I hope he'll show me something.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.185
Tell him yourself.

12:23.033 --> 12:25.155
Are you Mr Frenhofer?

12:27.744 --> 12:30.615
He's not here.
Here's Mrs Frenhofer.

12:37.797 --> 12:39.671
You want to see my husband?

12:39.881 --> 12:42.634
No, I'm looking for Nicolas Wartel.

12:42.843 --> 12:44.965
Do you know where I could find him?

12:45.177 --> 12:48.132
He might be at the village inn.

12:48.348 --> 12:50.719
Thank you. Good bye.

12:52.184 --> 12:55.387
I'm Julienne, his sister.

13:16.832 --> 13:18.114
Shit!

13:56.243 --> 13:57.656
Can I have some?

14:05.335 --> 14:06.331
More.

14:20.433 --> 14:23.055
So, I'm going to...

14:24.437 --> 14:26.228
tell you a riddle.

14:28.689 --> 14:30.517
What is it that walks...

14:30.733 --> 14:33.023
on a hollow track,

14:36.073 --> 14:38.230
never goes to sleep...

14:38.657 --> 14:41.411
and never goes back?

14:42.579 --> 14:43.990
I don't know.

14:44.747 --> 14:45.945
Is it you?

14:46.750 --> 14:49.619
No, not really.

14:50.377 --> 14:52.287
- It's me?
- No...

14:52.588 --> 14:55.423
not at all. Don't exaggerate.

14:57.884 --> 14:59.545
I give up.

15:01.431 --> 15:03.089
It's a river.

15:04.307 --> 15:05.172
A stream.

15:05.433 --> 15:09.097
Yes, sure. A river.

15:11.440 --> 15:12.387
Disappointed?

15:12.606 --> 15:13.934
No!

15:16.194 --> 15:18.896
You're always disappointed
with the answer.

15:20.739 --> 15:22.446
You say it because you think...

15:22.657 --> 15:25.694
you'll be disappointed when I finish.

15:25.912 --> 15:28.402
No, I don't.

15:28.997 --> 15:32.696
I'm expecting nothing.
I lost the notion of time.

15:33.209 --> 15:35.961
I could be 100 years old, or a baby.

15:36.254 --> 15:39.538
I feel I'm in a tunnel with no light,

15:39.756 --> 15:43.504
no rain, no wind, no sun,
no cold, no warmth...

15:44.636 --> 15:48.136
There's just a very small light
right at the very end...

15:48.348 --> 15:49.047
flickering...

15:50.434 --> 15:52.140
flickering...

16:02.611 --> 16:03.690
I found you.

16:06.405 --> 16:07.865
No, I lost you again.

16:08.699 --> 16:10.111
Why did you move?

16:12.621 --> 16:14.281
Did I?

16:15.083 --> 16:17.288
Of course, it's my fault.

16:17.667 --> 16:19.909
Yes, it's you who moved.

16:21.169 --> 16:24.124
No, it's you, come on here...

16:24.339 --> 16:26.960
You were like that...

16:27.176 --> 16:29.749
and where was I?

16:31.428 --> 16:33.172
- No.
- What? Was I here?

16:33.389 --> 16:34.005
Here. No...

16:34.223 --> 16:35.599
Was I like that?

16:38.144 --> 16:39.640
- I was... here.
- No.

16:39.855 --> 16:40.968
Or here?

16:41.982 --> 16:44.472
Here. Right here.

16:44.818 --> 16:46.643
What? Come on, what is it?

16:47.443 --> 16:51.524
Don't move. Look at me.
So, I was like that.

16:57.703 --> 16:59.364
Tell me where I was.

17:00.081 --> 17:02.702
Where was I?

17:07.628 --> 17:09.540
Where was I?

17:13.886 --> 17:17.550
Stop it. Where was I?

17:20.473 --> 17:22.300
No, let's get serious.

17:22.517 --> 17:23.894
I am serious.

17:24.104 --> 17:26.855
We've got work to do. Come on!

17:32.110 --> 17:33.190
Where are you?

17:33.654 --> 17:34.685
I'm here. Where else?

17:35.905 --> 17:38.028
Stop moving, come on.

17:38.241 --> 17:40.814
Keep still, or I'll get angry.

19:05.655 --> 19:07.945
Excuse me, anybody called me?

19:15.122 --> 19:16.866
You're unbelievable!

19:18.166 --> 19:20.373
I thought you'd be sulking...

19:20.961 --> 19:23.533
but you couldn't get angry
about seeing me.

19:23.754 --> 19:25.083
You got it right.

19:27.426 --> 19:28.801
It's fixed with the gallery.

19:29.010 --> 19:30.754
I don't care about the gallery.

19:31.890 --> 19:32.754
Tell me everything.

28:47.277 --> 28:51.107
Now you can take a rest.

28:53.157 --> 28:54.985
I'd like to go to sleep...

28:56.577 --> 28:57.658
can I sleep here?

28:57.871 --> 28:59.662
Certainly not here,

29:00.457 --> 29:02.533
but you can rest in the house.

29:04.292 --> 29:07.045
There are rooms for friends.

29:13.467 --> 29:15.295
I have to telephone...

29:38.657 --> 29:40.151
There's a call for you.

29:50.335 --> 29:53.003
Yes, it's you?

30:39.464 --> 30:41.208
No, it isn't worth the trouble.

30:41.508 --> 30:43.548
It may get cold at night.

30:51.058 --> 30:52.517
It's nice.

30:53.185 --> 30:56.020
There are some nice things inside...

31:00.901 --> 31:03.143
I'm sure this one will suit you.

31:03.362 --> 31:04.559
I don't like jewels.

31:04.779 --> 31:07.449
You've never had anything like this.

31:08.533 --> 31:09.944
Try it on...

31:10.910 --> 31:12.867
Wait, let me do it for you.

31:13.079 --> 31:14.406
I said no!

31:16.330 --> 31:19.166
I've had enough of you
treating me like a doll.

31:33.597 --> 31:37.049
I'm sorry...
I don't know what got hold of me.

31:37.476 --> 31:38.886
It's all right.

31:44.023 --> 31:46.561
It's all right, it's false.

31:51.113 --> 31:52.822
Good night, Marianne.

32:17.389 --> 32:20.092
- You're not coming?
- I can't. Not right now.

32:20.431 --> 32:21.713
Where are you going?

32:21.935 --> 32:24.555
To the studio. Don't wait for me.

32:54.421 --> 32:55.999
Damn it! What is it?

32:56.633 --> 32:59.171
You've been fidgeting
for the last hour.

32:59.635 --> 33:01.593
I can't sleep.

33:02.305 --> 33:03.634
Neither can I.

33:06.933 --> 33:08.761
It's the room...

33:12.731 --> 33:15.103
Just like la rue de I'Echiquier.

33:17.318 --> 33:18.647
This one's bigger.

33:19.194 --> 33:20.773
The ceiling's higher...

33:22.364 --> 33:24.737
How I hated that studio...

33:25.827 --> 33:27.785
You haven't always said so...

33:28.205 --> 33:30.078
Before Marianne you'd loved it.

33:30.289 --> 33:32.662
You're disgusting. It isn't true.

33:33.584 --> 33:35.624
I shouldn't have come here.

33:35.836 --> 33:37.378
I didn't ask you...

33:38.463 --> 33:40.254
You had nothing else to do?

33:40.840 --> 33:44.624
Of course,
I had a lot to do...

33:44.844 --> 33:47.418
but I always choose the worst... you.

33:52.727 --> 33:55.265
You know what? I found ajob.

33:55.480 --> 33:56.676
It was high time...

33:56.897 --> 33:58.224
Guess where!

34:59.371 --> 35:01.163
You never miss me...

35:01.957 --> 35:05.657
You never want to know how I am,
you never write to me...

35:06.212 --> 35:09.793
Stop it...
Anyway I don't believe you.

35:10.006 --> 35:12.626
You found nothing,
you're going nowhere.

35:16.429 --> 35:20.425
Believe it or not, Monday I'm gone
and you will never see me again.

35:31.277 --> 35:32.389
Where's Wellington?

35:32.610 --> 35:36.146
The other side of the world.
You never thought I'd be able to do it...

35:36.364 --> 35:39.400
I've been thinking this thing over
for 2 months.

35:39.617 --> 35:41.525
A great site, excellent pay.

35:42.620 --> 35:44.196
You can't do that to me...

35:45.998 --> 35:48.155
Now, that was worth a million.

35:48.375 --> 35:50.118
I don't regret coming here.

35:50.336 --> 35:51.959
You do what you like...

35:54.506 --> 35:56.131
only it's a bad time for me.

35:56.340 --> 35:58.464
Yes, you can't stand the solitude.

35:59.302 --> 36:01.258
- Who can stand it?
- I can.

36:02.305 --> 36:05.674
Don't worry, Nicolas,
Marianne won't leave like that.

36:05.891 --> 36:07.005
You hate her...

36:07.226 --> 36:09.717
I'd surely give her my plane ticket.

36:11.186 --> 36:15.020
You'll like that.
I'm not really sure if I'm leaving.

36:16.442 --> 36:18.519
I won't use this ticket.

36:20.197 --> 36:21.606
You're disappointed?

36:21.822 --> 36:24.694
No, but if it's because of me...

36:25.410 --> 36:27.901
Don't worry, it's not you.

36:29.496 --> 36:33.328
It's the guy who offered me the job.
He loves me and it makes me sick.

36:33.541 --> 36:34.823
But if it's well paid...

36:35.044 --> 36:37.451
Come on, get me to walk the street!

36:37.671 --> 36:40.458
It's not what I meant.

36:45.802 --> 36:48.010
Still thinking about this call?

36:48.889 --> 36:52.009
I don't even have the guts
to go to the Frenhofers...

36:52.310 --> 36:53.589
It's not difficult.

36:55.853 --> 36:57.052
Speak for yourself.

36:57.272 --> 37:00.107
I'll go there. Tomorrow I will.

42:19.029 --> 42:20.355
There's the coffee.

43:12.451 --> 43:14.409
I've been to the studio.

43:15.456 --> 43:16.618
I've seen it.

43:19.834 --> 43:21.115
I know.

43:24.379 --> 43:25.923
I'm sorry...

43:26.465 --> 43:28.209
I couldn't find you, so...

43:28.426 --> 43:30.085
Don't be sorry.

43:33.971 --> 43:35.134
It's bothering you.

43:38.476 --> 43:41.015
It's a work in progress. I don't like...

43:41.604 --> 43:43.016
Yes, I know.

43:45.191 --> 43:47.268
But tell me something...

43:48.069 --> 43:51.023
Since when
for one work in progress...

43:51.488 --> 43:53.942
you have to destroy another one?

43:57.245 --> 43:58.736
It's not...

44:00.247 --> 44:04.078
An old one, O.K., abandoned, O. K...

44:04.293 --> 44:06.249
but there was my face there

44:07.463 --> 44:09.170
and I liked it.

44:10.924 --> 44:12.169
You had to wipe me out.

44:13.299 --> 44:15.459
It's not you I wiped out.

44:16.303 --> 44:20.383
What's the word for it?
You replaced me, yes.

44:21.475 --> 44:24.309
You put some buttocks
in place of my face.

44:28.481 --> 44:30.024
Give me some coffee.

44:52.544 --> 44:54.668
I couldn't do it differently.

44:57.507 --> 45:00.178
I can't go on with the work

45:00.385 --> 45:03.256
if I keep recollections, regrets...

45:03.680 --> 45:05.388
I just had to do it.

45:06.142 --> 45:09.510
And believe it or not,
it wasn't easy for me.

45:09.727 --> 45:11.057
I can imagine.

45:11.480 --> 45:13.887
You must've had a dreadful night.

45:15.190 --> 45:17.764
Uncomfortable
from all points of view.

45:34.626 --> 45:37.376
You think I'm justjealous.

45:38.003 --> 45:39.995
You expect I'll burst out.

45:40.882 --> 45:42.079
I won't.

45:43.510 --> 45:46.179
But ten years ago, when you started

45:46.386 --> 45:49.091
the work you've just botched up.

45:49.307 --> 45:51.014
Remember...?

45:51.765 --> 45:55.302
We didn't go out of the studio
for a week...

45:56.270 --> 45:58.310
we slept on the little mattress...

45:59.191 --> 46:02.641
there was no day, no night...

46:03.736 --> 46:05.065
do you remember?

46:05.279 --> 46:08.364
I do. It's exactly the kind of memory
I don't want.

46:08.574 --> 46:10.733
Not now...

46:10.950 --> 46:13.027
At that time you were still...

46:13.245 --> 46:15.736
so full of ideas and energy.

46:17.040 --> 46:19.994
You know what I thought when
I saw you asleep?

46:20.210 --> 46:21.488
No. I don't want to know.

46:21.710 --> 46:23.869
And yet I'll tell you.

46:25.755 --> 46:27.749
No, you're right...

46:28.800 --> 46:30.793
I won't tell you.

46:46.275 --> 46:47.935
It's funny.

46:48.527 --> 46:50.814
It looks more and more like you.

46:55.700 --> 46:57.445
Do you realize? 10 years ago...

46:57.996 --> 46:59.703
you quit searching.

46:59.914 --> 47:02.404
Just when you should have gone
all the way.

47:02.666 --> 47:04.872
And you got scared...

47:07.921 --> 47:09.747
I'd have gone along.

47:10.171 --> 47:12.212
I was ready to accept all of it...

47:12.508 --> 47:16.587
because we had each other
and it was stronger than before.

47:19.806 --> 47:23.009
You mean stronger
than before Balthazar?

47:23.226 --> 47:25.182
Who cares about Porbus!

47:25.394 --> 47:28.847
He suffered more than you
and he's still suffering.

47:29.274 --> 47:30.768
It's about you and me.

47:31.776 --> 47:33.270
What you've done is...

47:33.570 --> 47:35.192
diminishing us.

47:35.613 --> 47:37.770
You've made us sick of each other.

47:40.534 --> 47:41.696
Don't talk like that.

47:41.910 --> 47:43.321
Why not?

47:44.370 --> 47:46.992
Because we've had
a nice life together?

47:47.707 --> 47:49.995
Happiness, as you call it.

47:52.503 --> 47:54.625
But happiness at this price...

47:55.256 --> 47:56.798
is sad.

47:57.341 --> 47:59.167
You are sad Frenho...

47:59.675 --> 48:01.301
Look at yourself.

48:07.308 --> 48:09.016
That was it, this morning?

48:09.226 --> 48:11.185
No, it's not what I thought then.

48:12.439 --> 48:14.845
You're sad because
you're no longer young.

48:15.441 --> 48:17.399
Your strength has left you.

48:18.611 --> 48:21.778
10 years ago that painting
was the beginning of a story.

48:21.988 --> 48:25.689
But now it's not a new beginning...

48:26.409 --> 48:27.904
It's the end...

48:28.161 --> 48:29.739
You're saying it so coldly.

48:29.954 --> 48:32.161
How do you want me to say it?

48:33.332 --> 48:35.041
You've lied for 10 years.

48:35.251 --> 48:38.666
It's easy to continue.
Everybody does it. Go on, if you wish.

48:45.928 --> 48:47.387
You're cruel.

48:47.597 --> 48:49.588
I'm just like that...

48:50.849 --> 48:52.344
Cruel.

48:53.392 --> 48:55.930
Haven't you noticed before?

49:27.591 --> 49:28.967
Don't get flabby.

49:30.261 --> 49:32.928
Stretch all the way all the time.

49:38.224 --> 49:38.807
Look at me.

50:29.356 --> 50:30.816
He says...

50:31.816 --> 50:34.355
he feels caught in a trap...

50:35.446 --> 50:38.649
that he accepted
some kind of a deal.

50:39.534 --> 50:40.483
So I've come to you.

50:41.617 --> 50:43.907
He's worried about Marianne.

50:45.123 --> 50:48.870
He thinks they're going to have...
how do you call it...

50:49.376 --> 50:52.625
an affair, or something.

50:53.254 --> 50:56.918
I think he's wrong,
but he's right to worry.

51:00.177 --> 51:03.214
Frenho is probably finishing
the painting.

51:04.307 --> 51:07.093
Marianne'd better not see it...

51:07.309 --> 51:08.423
when it's over.

51:08.643 --> 51:09.224
Why?

51:10.020 --> 51:11.679
What can it do?

51:12.146 --> 51:14.982
Frenhofer won't protect her.

51:16.942 --> 51:20.027
I'd been his model for a long time...

51:20.362 --> 51:23.279
his favourite model...

51:23.782 --> 51:26.402
unique, you could say.

51:28.995 --> 51:30.276
First...

51:30.621 --> 51:33.374
he wanted to paint me
because he loved me,

51:34.626 --> 51:36.451
and then...

51:44.177 --> 51:46.583
Then because he loved me...

51:47.346 --> 51:49.469
he didn't want to paint me.

51:50.723 --> 51:54.556
It was me or painting,
that's what he said.

51:59.066 --> 52:00.522
I don't understand.

52:01.317 --> 52:03.772
It wasn't a question
of life and death.

52:04.028 --> 52:05.568
Why not?

52:05.820 --> 52:08.277
They say when you're drowning...

52:08.490 --> 52:10.362
you suddenly see all your life.

52:10.574 --> 52:12.734
All the forgotten memories.

52:13.411 --> 52:15.569
In a fraction of a second.

52:16.123 --> 52:19.574
Is it really possible...

52:19.792 --> 52:21.999
to capture a whole life...

52:22.629 --> 52:24.620
on the canvas of a painting?

52:25.129 --> 52:28.333
Just like that... with a few...

52:28.551 --> 52:29.416
traces of paint?

52:31.219 --> 52:33.545
It seems unbelievable...

52:34.596 --> 52:38.678
but actually this is what
Frenhofer was searching for.

52:41.980 --> 52:44.221
You mean this is something...

52:45.483 --> 52:46.977
shameless?

52:49.277 --> 52:53.146
Yes, that's it... shameless.

52:54.031 --> 52:57.448
It's not the flesh that's shameless,

52:58.245 --> 52:59.903
it's not the nudity...

53:01.789 --> 53:04.244
it's something else.

53:28.064 --> 53:29.808
Lower your arm.

53:31.192 --> 53:33.066
Turn your face.

53:36.030 --> 53:37.738
Look at me.

53:40.784 --> 53:42.658
Raise your hand.

53:44.746 --> 53:46.489
Turn it over.

53:48.040 --> 53:48.573
Like that.

53:48.790 --> 53:49.621
It's different.

53:49.833 --> 53:51.542
No, it's more precise.

53:56.716 --> 53:58.837
You're searching for something...

53:59.844 --> 54:01.837
something you've once seen?

54:02.138 --> 54:03.416
Maybe.

54:38.336 --> 54:39.712
Is it finished?

54:40.880 --> 54:41.996
Maybe.

54:47.303 --> 54:48.963
Can I have a look now?

54:49.890 --> 54:51.053
It's finished?

54:54.852 --> 54:56.679
You'll tell me.

56:08.045 --> 56:09.374
Anybody here?

56:31.984 --> 56:32.849
Miss?

56:33.068 --> 56:34.397
Go away!

56:34.862 --> 56:37.317
Something's wrong? I'll tell Madame.

56:38.282 --> 56:39.527
I'm fine.

58:22.127 --> 58:25.462
What are you doing here?
Where's Nicolas?

58:25.673 --> 58:28.211
- He went out... He wasn't well.
- Tell him I'm leaving.

58:28.424 --> 58:30.548
- What will you do?
- Get out of here.

58:30.761 --> 58:32.801
Without talking to Nicolas?

58:33.013 --> 58:35.682
Listen Julienne, you're not his wife.

58:35.890 --> 58:37.717
I put up with you a long time...

58:37.934 --> 58:41.978
but now mind your own business
and leave us alone.

58:42.938 --> 58:46.853
Shut up! Do you think putting up
with you was a pleasure?

58:47.234 --> 58:49.690
3 living in 6 square meters...

58:49.903 --> 58:53.022
coming home late
so as not to see you doing it...

58:54.783 --> 58:57.819
but I said we'd find a solution...

58:58.577 --> 59:00.986
So I found it, I just left.

59:03.915 --> 59:06.324
Only I know how much I paid for it.

59:06.627 --> 59:08.832
So you won't leave him like that.

59:10.839 --> 59:14.173
Anyway I can't stay with him.
I don't love him enough.

59:14.384 --> 59:15.548
Nothing but yourself...

59:15.761 --> 59:18.167
It's not true... if only you saw...

59:19.305 --> 59:20.930
I must go
before they found out.

59:21.141 --> 59:24.343
Who cares about them?
It's all in your head.

59:27.520 --> 59:29.514
It's not in my head.

59:31.317 --> 59:32.643
I saw it.

59:39.700 --> 59:43.233
A thing which was cold and dry.

59:44.537 --> 59:46.032
It was me.

59:49.875 --> 59:51.536
What are you talking about?

59:52.043 --> 59:54.582
If you're leaving Nicolas,
you tell him.

59:55.882 --> 59:57.290
I can't.

59:58.925 --> 01:00:00.634
So take a little rest.

01:00:06.183 --> 01:00:07.759
Wait one night at least.

01:00:07.976 --> 01:00:11.427
That's right.
Tomorrow's another day.

01:00:14.899 --> 01:00:16.771
I'm tired.

01:00:19.319 --> 01:00:21.725
You can sleep in my room.

01:00:22.739 --> 01:00:24.447
I'll talk to Nicolas.

01:01:16.329 --> 01:01:17.576
You've finally escaped?

01:01:17.791 --> 01:01:20.412
I waited until mum fell asleep.
If she wakes up...

01:01:20.625 --> 01:01:21.539
She won't.

01:01:21.752 --> 01:01:24.244
Unless she stumbles.
She walks in her sleep.

01:01:30.384 --> 01:01:32.044
She's beautiful.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.552
- It's the young lady?
- Yes.

01:01:37.308 --> 01:01:38.886
Now, listen...

01:01:39.644 --> 01:01:43.013
I am much older than you are...
but we'll share a secret.

01:01:43.690 --> 01:01:45.431
Can you keep a secret?

01:01:45.731 --> 01:01:46.681
Yes.

01:01:50.987 --> 01:01:52.186
Hold it.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:17.965
Hold it firmly.

01:02:25.561 --> 01:02:26.427
Help me...

01:02:26.645 --> 01:02:27.973
Is this the secret?

01:02:35.571 --> 01:02:37.149
Hold it...

01:02:57.174 --> 01:02:59.295
It's like letters from Joseph...

01:03:01.011 --> 01:03:03.466
they're all stored in a shoe-box...

01:03:07.141 --> 01:03:10.925
that I hid in the greenhouse,
in the kitchen garden...

01:03:11.562 --> 01:03:13.519
behind the old watering cans.

01:03:18.693 --> 01:03:21.648
When it's raining
I like going there...

01:03:23.531 --> 01:03:25.025
to read them.

01:03:29.244 --> 01:03:31.534
It feels nice there when it's raining.

01:03:31.831 --> 01:03:33.489
Yes, but this time...

01:03:34.541 --> 01:03:36.415
whether it's raining or not,

01:03:37.461 --> 01:03:39.832
you mustn't ever look at it. Never.

01:03:42.216 --> 01:03:45.051
Our secret...

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:50.003
means you've never seen
this painting. It doesn't exist.

01:03:50.473 --> 01:03:51.850
Do you understand?

01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:54.975
Yes, sir.

01:03:56.605 --> 01:03:58.594
How long should I keep it?

01:03:59.064 --> 01:04:02.930
Always. Even when I'm gone.

01:07:49.527 --> 01:07:50.939
What's the matter?

01:07:51.738 --> 01:07:53.530
Shooting stars...

01:07:55.784 --> 01:07:57.194
Make a wish.

01:07:58.578 --> 01:08:00.784
It's a bit late to make a wish.

01:08:02.289 --> 01:08:03.747
Why're you saying this?

01:08:06.459 --> 01:08:08.536
Because I stopped expecting things.

01:09:08.893 --> 01:09:11.135
You know what I thought
this morning...

01:09:11.979 --> 01:09:14.517
when I saw you asleep
in the studio?

01:09:18.066 --> 01:09:22.147
I thought you were dead...
and me too...

01:09:33.916 --> 01:09:35.624
I'm dead...

01:09:38.502 --> 01:09:40.461
and then?

01:09:42.006 --> 01:09:44.129
It's a funny kind of love...

01:09:45.676 --> 01:09:49.211
sleeping together for the first time
in a grave...

01:09:56.521 --> 01:09:58.559
I'd like to know...

01:10:00.859 --> 01:10:03.312
after such an exhaustion...

01:10:08.072 --> 01:10:09.864
what remains dead...

01:10:10.074 --> 01:10:13.359
and cannot be restored.

01:10:15.163 --> 01:10:16.361
Everything.

01:11:11.589 --> 01:11:13.381
So, here we are.

01:11:14.427 --> 01:11:17.343
It's not the most
wonderful moment for me.

01:11:18.137 --> 01:11:20.130
I can barely stand it
coming to an end.

01:11:26.478 --> 01:11:28.636
Maybe you expected
something different...

01:11:31.858 --> 01:11:33.436
So did I, in a way.

01:11:34.154 --> 01:11:36.560
A finished work is a new-born baby.

01:11:36.779 --> 01:11:39.697
I need time to understand what it is...

01:11:41.074 --> 01:11:42.569
what it will be.

01:11:43.327 --> 01:11:44.950
But I've no more time...

01:11:54.629 --> 01:11:56.955
It's my first posthumous work.

01:11:57.465 --> 01:11:58.843
It's much more expensive.

01:12:59.229 --> 01:13:01.389
What you've done is beautiful.

01:13:02.484 --> 01:13:04.060
You mean the painting?

01:13:05.069 --> 01:13:09.113
I mean the painting,
the real one...

01:13:10.283 --> 01:13:13.946
and also what you've done.

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.320
I hoped I'd surprise you.

01:13:17.416 --> 01:13:19.620
You'll always surprise me...

01:13:22.086 --> 01:13:23.412
always.

01:13:58.493 --> 01:14:00.202
Can I have a cigarette?

01:14:01.999 --> 01:14:03.824
You smoke too much, Marianne.

01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:06.827
I like blackening my lungs.

01:14:09.755 --> 01:14:12.872
Marianne put on
her old mask again...

01:14:14.258 --> 01:14:16.133
or maybe she took a new one.

01:14:23.183 --> 01:14:25.177
I like your sister very much.

01:14:27.145 --> 01:14:29.767
You're lucky to have someone like her.

01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:33.184
I don't know if I'm lucky,
but I will need to be.

01:14:33.401 --> 01:14:35.940
Oh no, everything's going to be fine.

01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:41.523
What's lasted for 3 years
can't just break in 3 days.

01:14:41.742 --> 01:14:42.819
You think so?

01:14:43.034 --> 01:14:44.493
I'm sure of that.

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.747
So, what do you think of that?

01:14:58.132 --> 01:15:01.217
It's nice, but I understand nothing.

01:15:02.010 --> 01:15:03.553
You don't like modern painting...

01:15:03.763 --> 01:15:05.922
No. All I like is Titian.

01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:08.512
It's Titian that I've done!

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.104
You're satisfied?
Is that what you wanted?

01:15:16.774 --> 01:15:19.776
All I wanted was a painting.
I've got it.

01:15:20.613 --> 01:15:22.734
Let's have some more champagne.

01:15:36.834 --> 01:15:38.330
You're still here?

01:15:39.296 --> 01:15:41.666
Why not at work?

01:15:41.881 --> 01:15:44.669
I need grey weather
and Parisian light.

01:15:44.886 --> 01:15:46.377
Who doesn't need it?

01:15:57.311 --> 01:15:59.185
I'd like to ask you a question.

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:05.271
You said you're looking
for truth in a painting...

01:16:06.027 --> 01:16:07.403
Is it always so?

01:16:11.198 --> 01:16:15.280
You're asking as a friend,
or as an enemy?

01:16:19.958 --> 01:16:22.283
I don't think a painter has enemies.

01:16:23.962 --> 01:16:25.834
Except for his bad paintings.

01:16:26.715 --> 01:16:28.957
What should I think you mean?

01:16:29.801 --> 01:16:31.378
Think what you want.

01:16:34.681 --> 01:16:37.349
I will always admire you, but...

01:16:38.392 --> 01:16:40.134
I feel sorry for you, too.

01:16:41.811 --> 01:16:45.641
I wouldn't like to finish like you...
in a comedy.

01:16:48.026 --> 01:16:52.106
Stay the way you are. I like you.

01:17:06.125 --> 01:17:07.157
It's a little cooler...

01:17:07.376 --> 01:17:08.920
That doesn't bother me.

01:17:09.628 --> 01:17:11.372
It's not that...

01:17:12.297 --> 01:17:13.710
I understand.

01:17:14.301 --> 01:17:16.626
For me it's also difficult.

01:17:17.053 --> 01:17:20.302
We both love someone for whom
everything else comes first.

01:17:22.767 --> 01:17:25.553
No, it's a vocation.

01:17:35.861 --> 01:17:38.649
Your brother has a great talent.

01:17:39.406 --> 01:17:41.151
He owes much to you, he says.

01:17:41.367 --> 01:17:44.117
But he doesn't know how
I believe in him.

01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:47.538
And how strong
my friendship for him is.

01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:50.621
I never really dared to tell him.

01:17:51.459 --> 01:17:54.458
Someone of such modesty...

01:17:56.756 --> 01:17:59.792
We didn't have time
to know each other.

01:18:00.801 --> 01:18:03.920
I'd be happy
to have dinner with you...

01:18:04.137 --> 01:18:05.217
and him some time.

01:18:11.144 --> 01:18:14.679
So the story is coming
to its end soon.

01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:30.239
I can't find the words.

01:18:31.455 --> 01:18:34.456
In painting
what is said doesn't count.

01:18:34.874 --> 01:18:36.250
You're right.

01:18:38.961 --> 01:18:40.621
Let's talk about figures.

01:18:45.134 --> 01:18:47.128
What has become of Marianne...

01:18:47.636 --> 01:18:49.795
you won't know tonight.

01:18:52.641 --> 01:18:55.558
Marianne? It's me.

01:18:56.730 --> 01:18:58.055
It used to be me.

01:19:00.273 --> 01:19:04.222
I didn't believe you when
you tried to warn me the other day.

01:19:04.569 --> 01:19:08.267
Forget it. Now you see
I shouldn't have been afraid.

01:19:08.488 --> 01:19:11.326
No, you were right
and I was unaware.

01:19:11.952 --> 01:19:13.575
I'm not unaware any more.

01:19:14.494 --> 01:19:16.287
I wanted you to know it.

01:19:31.053 --> 01:19:32.248
You're O.K.?

01:19:33.678 --> 01:19:35.008
I am afraid.

01:19:58.118 --> 01:19:59.661
I've packed our things.

01:20:01.330 --> 01:20:03.701
We'd better leave early
to avoid traffic jams.

01:20:06.751 --> 01:20:09.123
We could take the long way
through Spain.

01:20:10.548 --> 01:20:11.921
Barcelona...

01:20:13.049 --> 01:20:14.330
Montserrat...

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
No.
