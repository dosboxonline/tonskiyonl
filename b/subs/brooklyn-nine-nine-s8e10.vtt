07:24.652 --> 07:26.237
He survived the explosion,

07:26.320 --> 07:28.573
but he blamed himself
for what happened to you

07:28.656 --> 07:30.116
so he left New York.

07:30.199 --> 07:33.202
He's actually the sheriff
of a small town in Arizona.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.371
The town is so small he also
has to be the school principal.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.165
Okay, that's weird.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.208
It's actually very funny.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.751
And surprisingly heartwarming.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.211
Wait, no. No, no, no.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.005
This--this isn't really happening.

07:44.088 --> 07:45.423
I'm dreaming.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.550
And because this is a dream,
I'm in control.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.844
You know who's gonna walk
through that door right now?

07:49.927 --> 07:52.221
Bruce Willis.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.932
-Jake, you woke up!
-No! Teddy?

07:55.016 --> 07:56.893
Amy, why is your ex-boyfriend here?

07:56.976 --> 07:57.935
Oh, you haven't told him yet, babe?

07:58.019 --> 07:59.103
-Uh.
-Babe?

07:59.187 --> 08:00.646
He called you babe. What's going on?

08:00.730 --> 08:02.106
I'm sorry, I know this is a lot.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.608
-No.
-But the last seven years

08:03.691 --> 08:05.610
have been really hard.
Raising Mac on my own,

08:05.693 --> 08:06.861
never knowing if you would wake up,

08:06.944 --> 08:09.197
and Teddy was a great friend to me.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.698
And a couple years ago,

08:10.781 --> 08:12.366
-we went on a trip.
-It's not her fault.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.243
We were both seduced by the city of Tampa.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.245
I can't believe this.
You replaced me with Teddy?

08:16.329 --> 08:17.830
I could never replace you, Jake.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.832
I just wanted Mac to have
a father figure in his life.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.334
I come over and we watch sports.

08:21.417 --> 08:24.045
We are obsessed with college swimming.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.546
Hey, doc, can you put me back in the coma?

08:25.630 --> 08:27.798
You're agitated, that's normal.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.467
Tell me how you're feeling. Pain?

08:29.550 --> 08:30.760
I mean, just the pain of learning

08:30.843 --> 08:32.094
that my wife is married to another man.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.221
Oh, we're not married.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.180
I'm just here for Amy physically.

08:34.263 --> 08:35.431
That's worse!

08:35.515 --> 08:37.183
Okay, let's do some cognitive tests.

08:37.266 --> 08:39.227
How good is your memory
from before the accident?

08:39.310 --> 08:41.354
-Do you remember the fireworks?
-Yeah, I remember everything.

08:41.437 --> 08:42.980
I remember the whole heist,

08:43.064 --> 08:44.649
going to find Charles, the magnet suits.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.067
Do you remember where you hid the tube?

08:46.150 --> 08:48.194
Yeah, inside the fake baby.

08:48.277 --> 08:49.320
Thanks, babe.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.949
Oh, no. It's not the future, is it?

08:53.032 --> 08:54.909
No, it's only been about 40 minutes?

08:54.992 --> 08:57.078
And this isn't a real hospital.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.376
You <i>Mission: Impossible</i>d me!

09:03.459 --> 09:06.712
Oh, I'm so happy you're not
having sex with Teddy!

09:06.796 --> 09:07.880
[wheezing laugh]

09:08.130 --> 09:09.298
[Holt] <i>Damn it, we're locked in.</i>

09:09.382 --> 09:10.716
Who are you working with, you coward?

09:10.800 --> 09:11.968
I didn't do anything.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.886
I bet this was all Santiago's plan.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.638
She's making a play for the tube.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.265
She knew you hid it at Doggy Daycare.

09:17.348 --> 09:18.599
How do you know her plan?

09:18.683 --> 09:19.976
Since I wasn't part of the heist,

09:20.059 --> 09:21.644
people were sloppy around me
with their secrets.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.271
I know everything.

09:23.354 --> 09:24.605
For instance, I know the real tube

09:24.689 --> 09:26.691
is inside that creepy, fake baby doll.

09:26.774 --> 09:27.900
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

09:27.984 --> 09:29.151
I was trying to be respectful

09:29.235 --> 09:30.528
of the heisting process,

09:30.611 --> 09:32.530
but that was before I got screwed over.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.574
Well, your intel is of no use

09:34.657 --> 09:36.701
since we're locked in here.

09:36.784 --> 09:39.203
Unless you smash your
gigantic body through the wall.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.247
-I am not the Kool-Aid Man!
-Okay.

09:41.330 --> 09:43.708
I am more than my muscles
and I can prove it.

09:43.791 --> 09:46.085
All the locks in this building
have a magnetic release

09:46.168 --> 09:47.503
in case of a fire.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.922
If we can overload
the circuit, they'll unlock.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.215
We just need to connect

09:51.299 --> 09:53.426
the positive terminal of one outlet…

09:53.509 --> 09:55.511
[grunts] …to the negative of the other,

09:55.595 --> 09:58.264
using this circuit board
and a low-resistance wire.

09:58.347 --> 09:59.974
Luckily, I came prepared.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.476
Do suspenders conduct electricity?

10:02.560 --> 10:04.562
Oh, the gold thread!

10:04.645 --> 10:07.231
Now, we are about to overload the circuit.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.234
[electricity zapping]

10:11.652 --> 10:12.862
Bing pot.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.405
When did you have time to build all this?

10:14.488 --> 10:16.157
Oh, I had it prefabbed months ago,

10:16.240 --> 10:17.533
and I set it up while
you were looking for Charles.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.452
You planted the resignation
letter in my locker

10:19.535 --> 10:21.037
-so Charles would find it.
-Yep.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.372
And then I knew you'd wanna
show off the fireworks.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.708
-The fireworks that I sold you.
-You're Kristaps?

10:25.791 --> 10:27.501
[in German] Of course I'm Kristaps.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.045
[in English] Gah, I got to stop
falling for that.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.172
But wait, if everything
was fake, what knocked me out?

10:31.255 --> 10:33.341
-[timer beeping rapidly]
-Oh, no.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.469
-What are you doing?
-I know, Charles,

10:36.552 --> 10:38.512
but there's something
I have to tell you, okay?

10:38.596 --> 10:40.097
I locked Charles in a supply closet.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.141
I have but two things to say to you.

10:42.224 --> 10:43.434
One: thank you.

10:43.517 --> 10:44.518
I've always wanted to be chloroformed.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.812
And, two: how dare you?

10:46.896 --> 10:47.897
Sorry, babe.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.358
-But I play to win.
-Gah!

10:50.441 --> 10:52.693
That was super cool.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.654
I hate how attracted
I am to you right now!

10:54.737 --> 10:55.988
That worked so well.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.615
On to phase two.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.241
Thanks for doing that, Teddy.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.785
I'm really glad that
we could be friends again.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.495
Of course. I'll always be here for you.

11:02.578 --> 11:03.829
Which is why I have a question to ask.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.623
-Oh, no.
-Amy Santiago,

11:05.706 --> 11:06.666
-will you marry--
-No!

11:06.749 --> 11:08.834
I am married to Jake.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.544
And I'm married to Elizabeth.
It's perfect.

11:10.628 --> 11:11.754
Plus, you just betrayed him.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.172
You guys are obviously having issues.

11:13.255 --> 11:15.049
No, I only betrayed him
to pull off my secret plan.

11:15.132 --> 11:18.302
I am throwing him the perfect goodbye

11:18.386 --> 11:20.054
-and it has to be a surprise.
-Fine.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.722
But if you think I'm just gonna sit around

11:21.806 --> 11:24.975
and wait for you change your mind…

11:25.059 --> 11:26.310
you're right.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.145
I will be parked outside
for two more hours.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.731
Hello?

11:30.815 --> 11:33.317
Hello? Is there anyone here?

11:35.611 --> 11:37.363
-Mlepnos?
-No.

11:37.446 --> 11:39.031
What? Yeah.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.282
You played violin at my wedding.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.369
-You're Mlepnos!
-No, my name is Jerry.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.746
-Jerry Barfralatistan.
-What?

11:45.830 --> 11:47.456
It doesn't matter. I need your help.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.749
Can you please hand me
the keys that are down there?

11:48.833 --> 11:50.751
Yeah, yeah, yes.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.086
Thank you, I love keys.

11:52.169 --> 11:53.462
-Oh--
-And this is for you.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.006
-[soft chirping]
-What?

11:56.090 --> 11:58.342
As they say in my country,
a chicky for a key.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.635
Right.

11:59.718 --> 12:00.678
And what country is that again?

12:00.761 --> 12:02.555
-Honolulu.
-Okay.

12:02.638 --> 12:03.764
You know, if it's all the same,

12:03.848 --> 12:04.807
I'd really just rather have the key.

12:04.890 --> 12:05.891
You no want chicky?

12:05.975 --> 12:07.685
-I don't want key.
-Oh, perfect.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.770
Yes! Thank you, Mlepnos.

12:09.854 --> 12:13.858
No, it's Jerry… Barkakanatsan.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.025
I feel like maybe
you said it a little different

12:15.109 --> 12:16.444
the first time.

12:16.527 --> 12:18.654
There you are, my cheating wife!

12:18.737 --> 12:20.322
-Give me the tube.
-I don't have it.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.283
The baby's empty. You lied to me!

12:22.366 --> 12:23.909
I'm not the liar, you're the liar.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.703
I put a tracker in the tube
so I know you've hidden it

12:25.786 --> 12:27.037
somewhere in this-- Nope,
you were telling the truth,

12:27.121 --> 12:28.456
it's on the move. Someone else has it.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.000
It doesn't matter what you do, Ames,

12:31.083 --> 12:32.209
you're not gonna ruin this for me.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.878
Sorry, Jake, but I'm afraid I have to.

12:33.961 --> 12:35.463
-You'll thank me later.
-Wait, what does that mean?

12:35.546 --> 12:36.422
-I know what it means!
-[both shout]

12:36.505 --> 12:37.631
I heard you talking to Teddy

12:37.715 --> 12:38.883
outside the supply closet
you locked me in.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.885
Damn it! How did you get out?

12:40.968 --> 12:42.219
-[soft chirping]
-[gasps] Mlepnos.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.429
Amy's throwing you the perfect goodbye.

12:43.512 --> 12:45.389
Over my dead butt crack, she is.

12:45.473 --> 12:46.474
Although, thank you,
that was a very nice thought.

12:46.557 --> 12:47.850

They're going for the tube. Follow them.

12:54.231 --> 12:55.691
What are you doing, Scully?

12:55.774 --> 12:56.942
Everybody left the precinct

12:57.026 --> 12:58.194
and I was scared to be alone.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.445
[Jake] Come on!

13:00.237 --> 13:01.113
Pull over, we're here!

13:01.197 --> 13:03.532
[tires screech]

13:04.492 --> 13:06.243
Okay, according to the tracker it's close.

13:06.327 --> 13:07.661
Let's just agree
that we're gonna pick it up

13:07.745 --> 13:08.913
and head to the Brooklyn Bridge.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.498
Yeah, I agree. That you can suck it!

13:10.581 --> 13:11.874
We will end up at Shaw's,

13:11.957 --> 13:14.084
which is actually
a meaningful final location.

13:14.168 --> 13:16.879
[tires screech, horn honks]

13:16.962 --> 13:18.506
Are we too late? Did you get the tube?

13:18.589 --> 13:20.090
No, it's somewhere in this building.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.884
Brooklyn Storage Solutions.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.469
-[Amy] Wait a second.
-I know this place.

13:23.552 --> 13:24.678
Yes, this is where we worked

13:24.762 --> 13:26.013
our first case with Captain Holt.

13:26.096 --> 13:27.932
That's right, it's a meaningful location.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.142
Tonight is my victory lap.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.686
I planned the perfect goodbye.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.772
You have gotta be kidding me.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.902
You see, the whole heist was a ruse

13:39.985 --> 13:41.403
for the perfect goodbye I planned.

13:41.487 --> 13:42.530
I mean, it wasn't that perfect.

13:42.613 --> 13:43.781
A real perfect goodbye would've had--

13:43.864 --> 13:45.908
Sentimental gifts for everyone?

13:45.991 --> 13:47.910
Damn it! Just tell us how you did it.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.662
Everything hinged on Jeffords.

13:49.745 --> 13:51.413
I needed him to drop out of the heist

13:51.497 --> 13:53.374
so he'd have access to everyone's secrets,

13:53.457 --> 13:55.251
which is why I set up
a fake interview for him.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.544
You were working with Williams?

13:56.627 --> 13:57.920
But he locked us in his office.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.588
Which was critical to me
gaining your trust

13:59.672 --> 14:00.965
so you'd tell me
where the tube was hidden.

14:01.048 --> 14:03.425
-Terry's reeling.
-Armed with that information,

14:03.509 --> 14:05.928
I texted Kevin who retrieved the tube

14:06.011 --> 14:08.847
and handed it off to a person
who lured you all here

14:08.931 --> 14:10.516
and that person was a dog

14:10.599 --> 14:12.768
and that dog was Cheddar.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.353
Hold up. That big speech about

14:14.436 --> 14:16.730
how I'd make a great captain,
that was all a lie?

14:16.814 --> 14:17.940
No, no, I meant every word of it.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.358
In fact, it's exactly what I said

14:19.441 --> 14:20.776
to the real Williams two weeks ago.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.612
It's part of the reason
he decided to make you…

14:23.696 --> 14:25.698
the new captain of the Nine-Nine.

14:25.781 --> 14:28.117
Wait, what? Is this fake too?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.994
Y'all need to cut the [bleep]
and be honest with me.

14:30.077 --> 14:31.453
This is my life we're talking about.

14:31.537 --> 14:32.413
You want to know if it's real?

14:32.496 --> 14:34.957
Open your gift and find out.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.626
-A bag of fish?
-What? No.

14:37.710 --> 14:38.752
It's supposed to be your captain's bars.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.379
The fish are my present to Scully.

14:40.462 --> 14:41.922
They're the kind that eat
the dead skin off your feet.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.174
Ooh, they're gonna have a feast tonight.

14:44.258 --> 14:45.926
But wait, if that's not Terry's bars,

14:46.010 --> 14:46.886
what's in the real tube?

14:50.389 --> 14:52.474
-Wireless headphones?
-[Amy] They're AirPods.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.184
-They're my gift for everyone.
-What?

14:54.268 --> 14:56.020
But you told me not to get people AirPods!

14:56.103 --> 14:57.313
You said everyone already has headphones!

14:57.396 --> 14:58.606
Yeah, so you wouldn't buy them

14:58.689 --> 15:00.107
-and I would get all the glory.
-Wow.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.901
-Great gift, Amy.
-Come on!

15:01.984 --> 15:04.445
But if I don't have
the winning tube, who does?

15:06.363 --> 15:07.615
I do.

15:07.698 --> 15:10.075
Yet another surprise reveal again.

15:11.493 --> 15:13.287
So, my plan was simple.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.747
The best way to win is to sit back,

15:14.830 --> 15:16.624
watch everyone else,
and then choose your moment.

15:16.707 --> 15:18.417
But to do that, I needed people
to think I was gone.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.627
It's a trick she learned from me.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.671
[lisping] During the fourth heist,

15:22.755 --> 15:24.256
universally considered the best heist.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.633
You were so eager to think

15:25.716 --> 15:27.092
I'd drop everything
and chase after Adrian.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.510
So you don't want to end up with Pimento?

15:28.594 --> 15:29.887
No, but you believed it

15:29.970 --> 15:31.430
because you all think
for someone to be happy,

15:31.513 --> 15:33.223
their story has to end
with marriage and kids.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.768
I mean, I believed it because
you told me and I trust you.

15:35.851 --> 15:37.436
Whatever, breeder.
Anyway, with nobody watching me,

15:37.519 --> 15:39.104
I was able to figure out
what Holt was up to

15:39.229 --> 15:40.773
and then I had my other partner
intercept Cheddar.

15:40.856 --> 15:43.776
-Who was that?
-It's me, Bill.

15:43.859 --> 15:46.028
Thurprithe reveal.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.738
So, let's crown me.

15:47.821 --> 15:49.657
The Grand Champion of the Nine-Nine.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.992
A six-month subscription
to the Rosetta Stone?

15:52.076 --> 15:53.035
That's my present for Peralta.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.912

15:54.995 --> 15:56.330

-[Scully] What are you doing, Bill?

16:01.585 --> 16:03.963
[Bill] I'm sorry, but this is your
fault for ending the heists.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.464
They're my only source of income.

16:05.547 --> 16:06.924
You're still my best friends. Goodbye!

16:07.007 --> 16:08.884
-Bill!
-He's gone, we're trapped!

16:08.968 --> 16:10.552
Pardon me, excuse me.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.429
-Did you just say we're trapped?
-Who the hell are you?

16:12.513 --> 16:14.556
You don't recognize
Caroline Saint-Jacques Renard?

16:14.640 --> 16:17.393

for the Berlin Philharmonic?

16:17.476 --> 16:18.602
She's my surprise celebrity.

16:18.686 --> 16:19.812
Are you kidding me?

16:19.895 --> 16:21.313
You ruined my big goodbye to the Nine-Nine

16:21.397 --> 16:23.524
so we can listen to some nerd
play a giant violin?

16:23.607 --> 16:24.650
-Shall I begin?
-No.

16:24.733 --> 16:25.859
Wait, wait, wait,

16:25.943 --> 16:28.821
did you say your goodbye to the Nine-Nine?

16:28.904 --> 16:30.197
Where you going?

16:30.280 --> 16:32.908
Uh, well,

16:32.992 --> 16:34.868
I was hoping that this would be

16:34.952 --> 16:39.289
a more dramatic moment
accompanied by fireworks but…

16:39.373 --> 16:41.125
-I'm leaving the NYPD.
-You are?

16:41.208 --> 16:42.251
-What?
-Theriouthly?

16:42.334 --> 16:43.711
-For real?
-[Jake] Yeah.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.212
Today was my last day.

16:45.295 --> 16:46.797
And now it looks like

16:46.880 --> 16:47.798
it's gonna end with all of us

16:47.881 --> 16:50.509
locked in a storage facility.

16:50.592 --> 16:53.178
No, it's not.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.430
Can't you see?

16:54.513 --> 16:56.724
You all want the same thing,

16:56.807 --> 16:58.100
a perfect goodbye.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.227
But you're all getting
in each other's way.

17:00.310 --> 17:03.063
We are the Nine-Nine,

17:03.147 --> 17:05.107
and we work best together.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.942
And we're getting out of here together.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.778
So we're gonna find that tube
and we're gonna be crowned

17:09.862 --> 17:12.990
Grand Champions of the Nine-Nine together!

17:13.073 --> 17:15.284
Except for the ugly one
that made fun of my cello.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.453
Not now, Caroline Saint-Jacques Renard.

17:17.536 --> 17:18.871
I agree with Jeffords.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.372
Read the room,
Caroline Saint-Jacques Renard.

17:20.456 --> 17:21.915
Great speech, Terry, but
we're kind of trapped in here.

Not for long.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.503

17:29.631 --> 17:31.550

Ah!

Jake, we're free.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.481
Fair enough, I had to ask.

17:45.564 --> 17:48.067
All right, I got Bill on the GPS.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.401
Huh, that's weird.

17:49.485 --> 17:50.819
What? Where'd he go?

17:51.653 --> 17:52.946
Are you sure he came back to the precinct?

17:53.030 --> 17:54.448
The tracker must be broken.
There's no one here.

17:54.531 --> 17:57.159
Wrong, Captain!

17:57.242 --> 17:58.202
I'm here.

17:58.285 --> 17:59.369
Michael Hitchcock,

17:59.453 --> 18:02.498
the Grand Champion of the Nine-Nine.

18:02.581 --> 18:03.707
Hitchcock?

18:03.791 --> 18:06.585
Well, this doesn't feel right.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.715
I bet you're all wondering
how I pulled it off.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.300
Not really, but I guess
that's the tradition.

18:13.383 --> 18:14.343
The key to the whole plan

18:14.426 --> 18:15.594
was that I never really retired

18:15.677 --> 18:17.179
or moved to Brazil.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.348
I've been living in the
Beaver Trap this whole time.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.016
Okay, but what was the rest of the plan?

18:21.100 --> 18:22.309
Oh, we had not come up with it.

18:22.392 --> 18:23.602
But then Bill came by and offered

18:23.685 --> 18:26.396
to sell me the tube
for 40 bucks and I won.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.816
-Pretty good stuff.
-Now, crown me.

18:28.899 --> 18:30.442
Ugh, this stinks.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.402
Okay, Michael Hitchcock,

18:32.486 --> 18:34.988
you are an amazing human/genius

18:35.072 --> 18:38.325
and the Grand Champion of the Nine-Nine.

18:38.408 --> 18:39.660
Why is your head so sweaty?

18:39.743 --> 18:41.120
Oh, because that's actually butt skin

18:41.203 --> 18:43.080
from a botched hair transplant
so there are more pores.

18:43.163 --> 18:44.623
I can't believe this is how it ends,

18:44.706 --> 18:46.166
with Hitchcock's sweaty butt head.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.793
I told myself I wouldn't cry.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.211
Ah, Jake, I'm sorry you didn't get

18:49.294 --> 18:51.463
-your perfect goodbye.
-Yeah.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.006
This whole thing did kinda turn into

18:53.090 --> 18:54.591
a scalding hot mess.

18:54.675 --> 18:57.052
But to be honest,

18:57.136 --> 18:58.595
I think I just wanted
a big dramatic moment

18:58.679 --> 19:00.305
so that I wouldn't feel sad.

19:00.389 --> 19:03.308
Because goodbyes are inherently sad.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.893
They mean that something's ending.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.603
And this one is especially sad

19:06.687 --> 19:08.689
because what we had was so great.

19:08.772 --> 19:11.608
But it's not all sad, right?

19:11.692 --> 19:13.277
We're moving on to things that we love.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.028
And we'll always have

19:15.112 --> 19:17.197

19:17.281 --> 19:18.323

19:18.407 --> 19:19.575

to tell me about everyone.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.737
He told me you were a great detective,

21:20.821 --> 21:22.447

23:21.566 --> 23:23.151
Boyle, Larkin,

23:23.235 --> 23:24.611
I want you working
the J Street Axe Murder.

23:24.694 --> 23:25.987
Ooh, we're the butcher bimbos.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.114
-No.
-The butcher babes.

23:27.197 --> 23:28.365
-Nope.
-Detective Boyle and his

23:28.448 --> 23:29.616
-little butcher buddy.
-Oh, I like that.

23:29.699 --> 23:30.742
Now that that's been sorted,

23:30.826 --> 23:31.701
are there any questions?

23:31.785 --> 23:32.744
Yes!

23:32.828 --> 23:34.871
I have a question!

23:34.955 --> 23:36.873
Captain Jeffords,

23:36.957 --> 23:39.000
are you ready for the Halloween Heist?

23:39.084 --> 23:40.293
What are you doing, Peralta?

23:40.377 --> 23:41.920
Last year was the final heist.

23:42.003 --> 23:43.171
We all agreed it was over.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.590
Ah, Terry, you jolly simpleton.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.968
That was obviously a ruse.
I mean, did you really think

23:48.051 --> 23:49.636
I was gonna let Hitchcock
win the last heist?

23:49.719 --> 23:51.096
I mean, that would be crazy!

23:51.179 --> 23:52.347
Hitchcock? It would've been unforgivable.

23:52.430 --> 23:53.765
That's true, it felt wrong.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.851
I know someone who's in.

23:55.934 --> 23:59.104
The old janitor, which is actually me!

23:59.229 --> 24:00.939
Deputy Commissioner Raymond Holt.

24:01.022 --> 24:02.691
And he's not the only one.

24:02.774 --> 24:03.650
I'm in too.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.320
-Me too.
-As am I.

24:09.656 --> 24:10.615
Gina Linetti.

24:10.699 --> 24:11.658
That's right, Terry,

24:11.741 --> 24:13.160
this is happening every year.

24:13.243 --> 24:14.411
We're in each other's lives forever,

24:14.494 --> 24:15.662
whether you like it or not.

24:15.745 --> 24:18.456
So, what do you say, Captain?

24:18.540 --> 24:19.457
Are we doing this?

24:22.711 --> 24:25.547
What I say is…

24:25.630 --> 24:27.424
Nine-Nine!

24:27.507 --> 24:29.092
[all] Nine-Nine!

24:29.301 --> 24:30.927
<i>-Not a doctor.</i>
<i>-Shh.</i>

24:31.511 --> 24:32.888
<i>Fremulon.</i>
