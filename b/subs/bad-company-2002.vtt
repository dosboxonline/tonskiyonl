02:16.166 --> 02:17.208
He'll be here.

02:19.583 --> 02:22.625
Oh, yeah?
I do have other bidders.

02:22.709 --> 02:24.583
I personally vouch
for this man.

02:24.667 --> 02:26.709
Ah. Well,
I trust you, Michael,

02:28.250 --> 02:30.625
but you see, with each
degree of separation

02:30.709 --> 02:33.041
comes a degree
of uncertainty.

02:44.542 --> 02:45.917
Mr. Turner.

02:49.375 --> 02:50.583
Mr. Vas.

02:53.291 --> 02:57.291
The KGB once tried
to set me up.

02:57.375 --> 02:59.125
So I had to kill
three of their agents

02:59.208 --> 03:01.375
and then I hunted down
their families.

03:04.417 --> 03:07.333
The point is,
if I sense anything out
of the ordinary...

03:07.417 --> 03:10.000
No, the point is, I haven't
seen anything from you yet

03:10.083 --> 03:12.875
to justify a payment
of $20 million.

03:12.959 --> 03:17.709
So, before I hand over a small
fortune and risk my life,

03:17.792 --> 03:22.667
I want to know 100%
that you can in fact
deliver a device.

03:22.750 --> 03:24.333
That's the point.

03:24.417 --> 03:25.250

03:35.583 --> 03:37.083
This is your show
of good faith?

03:37.166 --> 03:38.750
Well, you're still alive.

03:38.834 --> 03:41.834
You consider that
a show of good faith.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.417
Now, what do
you have for me?

03:44.250 --> 03:45.709
Down payment.

03:45.792 --> 03:46.834
One million dollars.

03:49.792 --> 03:51.959
So when do I get the device?

03:53.750 --> 03:55.000
Let's say ten days.

03:57.083 --> 03:59.667
Michael,
you take that telephone

03:59.750 --> 04:02.041
and I will call you
and tell you how to proceed.

04:02.125 --> 04:03.959

all the time.

04:04.834 --> 04:06.375

the next time we meet,
I suggest you be on time.

04:33.041 --> 04:34.041

05:01.208 --> 05:03.083
So far so good?
Yeah, so far.

Kevin's got
a tail.
Is it Vas?

05:30.875 --> 05:34.000
No, they don't look Russian.
They don't look friendly.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.542
We better go back for him.

05:35.625 --> 05:37.500
You ordered us not to
jeopardize our cover, sir.

05:37.583 --> 05:38.583

05:39.542 --> 05:40.417

who they were?

07:36.792 --> 07:38.000
Kevin?

07:51.834 --> 07:54.166
Doesn't this all smack
of extreme desperation?

that fits neatly into
a carry-on suitcase?

07:57.166 --> 07:59.291
Kevin spends two years
getting close to these people

07:59.375 --> 08:00.875
in order to position
you as the buyer.

08:00.959 --> 08:04.291
Vas won't deal with
anyone else and we have
nine days to make this work.

08:04.375 --> 08:06.458
I'd say desperation
was the order of the day!

08:06.542 --> 08:08.291
Maybe Vas set Kevin up.

08:08.375 --> 08:10.458
My guess is
it's a rival buyer.

08:10.542 --> 08:13.625
Could be Pakistanis,

we can't afford
to get married.

it's ever gonna change.

do get married.

Oh, I'm sorry.

15:43.667 --> 15:44.625
Uh, Big Time Tickets.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.709
Yeah, for what game?

15:49.792 --> 15:51.208
Well, how much
you want to spend?

15:53.667 --> 15:54.667
Yeah, I can get it.

15:55.375 --> 15:56.709
HAYES: So where you at?

15:57.959 --> 15:59.458
Where the hell's that?

16:05.542 --> 16:07.583
Thank you very much.
Now take off.

16:07.667 --> 16:08.667
DRIVER: Whatever.

16:11.166 --> 16:12.375
CAREW: Hop out.
HAYES: Hey. What's up?

16:12.458 --> 16:14.625
Give me your phone.
What's up? Hey, hey, hey!
Come on, man!

16:14.709 --> 16:15.917
Relax.
What y'all want?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.667
Come on. Come on.
Relax.

16:17.750 --> 16:20.792
Do you know how hard
it was for me to get a cab
to come up here?

16:20.875 --> 16:22.458
I hope y'all are
getting me a ride back.

16:22.542 --> 16:24.625
Come on.
I know you're cops, man.
What do you want, money?

16:24.709 --> 16:28.709
Oh, I understand.
Y'all shot someone
and now y'all need a suspect.

16:29.834 --> 16:31.709
Mr. Hayes?
Jacob Hayes?

16:36.166 --> 16:39.500
I'm Officer Oakes.
That's Officer Seale.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.667
Officer Swanson.
Officer Carew.

16:42.709 --> 16:44.500
What, CIA? What's that for?

16:44.583 --> 16:46.333
Crackers In my Ass?

16:46.417 --> 16:49.000
You gonna arrest me
for scalping tickets?

16:49.083 --> 16:51.125
We just want to talk
to you about something.

16:51.208 --> 16:52.542
About what?

16:52.625 --> 16:54.166
About your brother.

16:54.250 --> 16:56.625
Well, you got the wrong guy.
I don't even have a brother.

17:00.208 --> 17:02.000
That's just a picture
of me in a suit.

17:02.083 --> 17:03.667
Could have got that
off the Internet.

17:03.750 --> 17:06.541
I saw a picture of Bill Gates
with three titties on the Net.

17:06.625 --> 17:09.165
Okay, September 8th, 1970.

17:09.250 --> 17:11.040
Bellevue Hospital,
New York City.

17:11.125 --> 17:13.125
A woman, registered
as Mary Jeffries,

17:13.208 --> 17:15.709
gives birth to
identical twins,

17:15.791 --> 17:19.333
but suffers complications
during labor and dies
the next day.

17:19.416 --> 17:20.500
What about the father?

17:20.583 --> 17:22.208
SEALE: Thomas B. Jeffries.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.916
Presumed alive.
Whereabouts unknown.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.916
The state rarely
separates twins,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.208
but one of the infants,
Jacob, that's you,

17:29.291 --> 17:31.583
was diagnosed with
severe lung infection.

17:31.667 --> 17:34.500
You still have the scar
from the chest tube,

17:34.583 --> 17:36.208
the incision mark.

17:36.291 --> 17:39.166
An administrator
at the hospital altered
the birth record

17:39.250 --> 17:42.709
to give the healthy child
a better chance at adoption.

17:42.792 --> 17:47.375
A week later,
Roger and Glenda Pope
took in Kevin Jeffries.

17:47.458 --> 17:50.333
The Popes never knew.
Kevin never knew.

17:50.417 --> 17:52.500
So I have a twin brother.
Big deal.

17:52.583 --> 17:54.041
What's the CIA
have to do with this?

17:54.125 --> 17:56.375
What, he couldn't
send me a letter?

17:56.458 --> 17:57.792
Your brother's dead.

17:59.834 --> 18:01.834
How?
A helicopter crash.

18:05.041 --> 18:08.125
We need your help,
Mr. Hayes.

18:08.208 --> 18:10.417
Your brother was working
on something with us.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.458
My twin brother was CIA?

18:12.542 --> 18:15.542
Yeah.
A clandestine operative.

18:15.625 --> 18:18.583
And just before he was killed
he set up a deal.

18:18.667 --> 18:19.709
What kind of deal?

18:19.792 --> 18:21.959
A very important one.

18:22.041 --> 18:23.959
So we need you to
stand in for him.

18:24.041 --> 18:26.583
Um, you know, just briefly.

18:26.667 --> 18:28.542
Pretend I'm him?

18:28.625 --> 18:30.709
Yeah.
For how long?

18:30.792 --> 18:32.125
Nine days.

18:32.208 --> 18:33.583
HAYES: Nine days.
That's not standing in.

18:33.667 --> 18:36.750
Standing in's like an hour.
Nine days, that's like
going on tour.

18:36.834 --> 18:38.417
Is this shit dangerous?

18:38.500 --> 18:39.583
Yeah, there's some risk.

18:39.667 --> 18:42.250
Well, what kind of risk?
We talking bad credit risk?

18:42.333 --> 18:43.917
Or bullet-in-ass risk?

18:44.000 --> 18:45.750
You'd be well-compensated.

18:45.834 --> 18:48.583
For bullet-in-ass risk?
I hope that's a lot
of compensation.

18:48.667 --> 18:49.959
How much?

18:50.041 --> 18:51.417
Throw out a number.

18:51.500 --> 18:52.625
One billion dollars.

18:52.709 --> 18:54.583
You've overshot.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.458
Well, I don't know
what kinda budget
you're working with.

18:56.542 --> 18:59.625
Well, we were thinking
somewhere in the region of,
let's say...

18:59.709 --> 19:01.750
Uh, $25,000.

19:01.834 --> 19:03.250
Fifty.

19:03.333 --> 19:05.917
Yeah, 50. I figure you
started with 25,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.417
so I know you got more,
and you ain't gonna give me
all your money.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.125
$50,000.

19:10.208 --> 19:11.792
This is what I'm thinking,
Mr. Hayes.

19:11.875 --> 19:15.792
With $25,000, your girlfriend
Julie could go to college.

19:15.875 --> 19:17.458
She wouldn't
have to go to Seattle.

19:17.542 --> 19:19.041
Or work with Ken.

19:20.208 --> 19:21.583
Okay. Here's what
I'm thinking.

19:21.667 --> 19:24.417
You're gonna give me
$50,000, tax-free.

19:25.583 --> 19:28.000
Okay, $50,000 after tax

19:28.083 --> 19:29.667
after the job is done.

19:29.750 --> 19:32.333
Half now, half after.

19:32.417 --> 19:34.625
Ten now, 40 after.

19:34.709 --> 19:36.959
Unless my mother had triplets

19:37.041 --> 19:40.083
you're gonna give me
10 now, 90 after.

19:41.583 --> 19:42.917
Okay, you got a deal.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.041
So when do we start?

19:46.125 --> 19:47.709
Now.

19:47.792 --> 19:49.625
This is your
brother's file.
Study it.

19:49.709 --> 19:50.834
HAYES: So there's homework?

19:50.917 --> 19:52.625
Preparation.
Okay.

19:52.709 --> 19:54.291
Let's see,
Dad sits on the board

19:54.375 --> 19:56.458
of the New York
Stock Exchange.

19:56.542 --> 19:58.875
Mom, Co-artistic Director
at Lincoln Center.

19:58.959 --> 20:00.709
Must have been nice.

20:00.792 --> 20:02.291
In my foster house
we were so poor,

20:02.375 --> 20:04.125
we used to lick stamps
for dinner.

20:04.208 --> 20:07.500
Let's see,
prep school at Exeter.

20:07.583 --> 20:09.333
Then college
at Dartmouth.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.208
Served in
the Naval Academy.

20:11.291 --> 20:12.250
That's right.

20:12.333 --> 20:13.625
What did he serve?
Lunch?

20:15.166 --> 20:18.208
Oh, man.
Rhodes scholar.

20:18.291 --> 20:19.375
So my brother
was real smart, huh?

20:19.458 --> 20:20.458
Yeah.

20:23.458 --> 20:26.333
Damn, the CIA is cheap!

20:26.417 --> 20:29.792
Y'all could have at least
got me a queen size.
What's this, jack size?

20:32.125 --> 20:34.667
Hey, uh, what's that
zahs-nod mean?

20:34.750 --> 20:37.000
It's Czech for bathroom.

20:37.083 --> 20:39.583
You'll find the room labeled
with phonetic translations.

20:39.667 --> 20:41.208
Why?

20:41.291 --> 20:43.000
'Cause the deal goes down
in the Czech Republic.

20:43.083 --> 20:44.583
Czech Republic?

20:44.667 --> 20:46.834
Here's a dictionary.

20:46.917 --> 20:48.250
Hey, how do I get
the outside line?

20:48.333 --> 20:50.208
I need somebody
to feed my cat.

20:50.291 --> 20:53.291
You don't have an outside line
and you don't have a cat.

20:53.375 --> 20:55.917
Okay, so what am I supposed
to be doing here?

20:56.000 --> 20:58.583
There's a tape in the VCR.
It's a video of your brother.

20:58.667 --> 21:01.208
Watch it. The way he talks
and the way he moves.

21:01.291 --> 21:04.083
I know there's
a lot to deal with here,
but we're all behind you.

21:04.166 --> 21:06.250
We'll start in the morning.
You got any questions?

21:06.333 --> 21:08.208
Yeah.

21:08.291 --> 21:11.166
If my brother
was such a genius,
then how come he's dead?

21:14.834 --> 21:16.458
5:00 a.m.

21:16.542 --> 21:18.291
Hey, I don't do 5:00 a.m.

21:18.375 --> 21:20.041
So, bottom line,
what are our chances?

21:20.125 --> 21:21.959
Well, I'd say
anywhere between

21:22.792 --> 21:23.959
nil and zero.

21:24.041 --> 21:25.125
Why do you say that?

21:25.208 --> 21:27.542
Well, I grant you
he's got potential.

21:27.625 --> 21:29.291
He's pretty street-smart.

21:29.375 --> 21:32.542
In six months
he could probably fool
his brother's own parents.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.792
But eight days? Come on.
You got to be kidding.

21:34.875 --> 21:39.291
Probably get himself killed
on this mission and anyone
else who goes along with him.

21:39.375 --> 21:41.458
Would you like
to be replaced
on the mission?

21:41.542 --> 21:44.917
Why? You saying you're going
ahead with or without me?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.542
Yeah, that's precisely
what I'm saying.

21:47.709 --> 21:49.166
Well, sir,

21:50.250 --> 21:53.250
when do I tell him
what this mission involves?

21:53.333 --> 21:55.959
Well, if I were you
I would tell him
as little as possible.

21:56.041 --> 21:57.792
Don't put anything
into his head he can't use.

21:57.875 --> 22:00.458
And certainly nothing
that could pop out
at the wrong time.

22:00.542 --> 22:02.667
Okay.
What's he doing now?

22:02.750 --> 22:04.458
He's studying.

22:04.542 --> 22:05.959
We told him
to learn a few key
phrases in Czech.

22:06.041 --> 22:08.041
(AWKWARDLY READS OUT WORDS)

22:09.333 --> 22:10.750
Well, he seems dedicated.

22:10.834 --> 22:12.834
(CONTINUES READING)

22:18.583 --> 22:20.000
What's he saying?

22:20.083 --> 22:23.834
He said, "I haven't had my
period in three months."

22:23.917 --> 22:25.583
(HAYES CONTINUES READING)

22:35.208 --> 22:37.625
Now what?

22:37.709 --> 22:41.166
"Where's the hospital?
I have a vaginal infection."

22:41.250 --> 22:44.333
(SNICKERS)
Yeah, this is going to
be really interesting.

22:44.417 --> 22:45.625
Can't wait to get started.

22:47.583 --> 22:52.000
Rise and shine, Mr. Hayes!
5:00 a.m. and all is well.

22:52.083 --> 22:55.583
How about three more hours
of sleep and some breakfast?

22:56.583 --> 22:58.125
How about a nice shower?

22:58.959 --> 23:00.750
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

23:00.834 --> 23:02.125
What's wrong with you?

23:02.959 --> 23:05.000
Morning.

23:05.083 --> 23:08.208
Today we'll be covering
basic operations protocol

23:08.291 --> 23:10.667
for the acquisition
of foreign assets,

23:10.750 --> 23:14.208
a procedure we like to call,
the three I's.

23:14.291 --> 23:15.625
Identifying the target,

23:16.500 --> 23:18.709
initiating the contact

23:18.792 --> 23:20.709
and infiltrating the network.

23:20.792 --> 23:22.709
Now you do it like him.

23:22.792 --> 23:23.959
Man, this is bugging me out.

23:24.041 --> 23:26.375
I feel like Michael Jackson
looking at old album covers.

23:26.458 --> 23:29.333
I mean, look at this guy,
he looks like me,
but it's not me.

23:30.417 --> 23:32.208
Yeah.

23:32.291 --> 23:34.208
So what did he like to do?
I mean, what kind of
sports was he into?

23:34.291 --> 23:35.709
What kind of music
did he listen to?

23:35.792 --> 23:38.041
He liked music.
He liked jazz and classical.

23:38.125 --> 23:39.959
Classical? Like Run DMC?

23:40.041 --> 23:41.083
He didn't like rap.

23:41.166 --> 23:42.959
Oh, come on, man.

23:43.041 --> 23:45.125
What 29-year-old
brother don't like
a little bit of rap?

23:45.208 --> 23:46.625
He didn't listen to rap.

23:46.709 --> 23:48.417
So what kind of sports
was he into?

23:48.500 --> 23:49.417
Skiing.

23:49.500 --> 23:53.625
Okay, so you got skiing,
the Navy, no rap.

23:53.709 --> 23:56.083
Yeah, we'd have had
a lot in common.

23:56.166 --> 23:58.750
(WHISPERS)
Sir? That meeting's
about to start.

23:58.834 --> 24:00.250
OAKES: What time?

24:00.333 --> 24:03.125
Um, well, Yates is gonna...
Okay.

24:03.208 --> 24:04.000
All right.
I'll be there.

24:04.542 --> 24:05.333
Thanks.

24:06.709 --> 24:08.083
So what's up with you
and Swanson?

24:08.166 --> 24:09.750
Hmm?

24:09.834 --> 24:11.750
Oh, come on, man.
I see there's something
going on there.

24:11.834 --> 24:13.417
Y'all got a little something
going on. Come on now.

24:13.500 --> 24:14.792
Look at you.
You're blushing.

24:16.834 --> 24:18.500
Do you mind if I say something
to you, Mr. Hayes?

24:19.458 --> 24:20.917
My friends,

What did you do?

38:55.542 --> 38:56.500
I didn't do nothing.
I didn't do nothing.

made something
of themselves

39:13.208 --> 39:14.792

40:40.000 --> 40:41.125

40:43.333 --> 40:45.750
I was just wondering
how many of your people

No, we're alone.

HAYES: You got the floor.

40:53.333 --> 40:55.417
Your brother
was assassinated.

40:55.500 --> 40:57.709
By the same guys
who came after me, right?

40:57.792 --> 40:59.750
I guess so.
Doing the same job as you.

40:59.834 --> 41:01.375
Which is what?

41:02.583 --> 41:04.625
Your brother as
Michael Turner

41:04.709 --> 41:06.625
was helping me buy something
off the black market.

PlayStation 3? What?

41:10.875 --> 41:12.083
I can't tell you if you're not
coming back in with us.

41:12.166 --> 41:14.625
Well, I'm not coming back in
with you if ain't telling me.

41:14.709 --> 41:17.750
Your brother died saving
my life. Did you know that?

41:17.834 --> 41:20.000
It should have been otherwise,
but that's the way it is.

41:21.250 --> 41:23.000
How are his
parents taking it?

41:29.041 --> 41:30.917
You didn't tell
his parents?

41:31.000 --> 41:32.959
No, and that's
the way we want it.

41:33.041 --> 41:35.583
How would you feel
if you died and
nobody told your wife?

41:36.667 --> 41:38.625
I'm not married.

41:38.709 --> 41:40.291
What, there's no
Mrs. Spy?

41:40.375 --> 41:41.625
Not anymore.

41:41.709 --> 41:44.125
Relationships and attachments
are useless in this business.

41:44.208 --> 41:45.291
So that's how
this job is.

41:45.375 --> 41:47.542
Even if they don't shoot
you, they take your life.

41:47.625 --> 41:49.875
I know it sounds hokey,
but I honestly believe

41:49.959 --> 41:52.709
our lives are about something
bigger than ourselves,

41:52.792 --> 41:55.208
and I'm offering you a chance
to commit to yourself
to something.

41:55.291 --> 41:58.542
You ain't offering me
nothing but a chance
at a bullet in my ass.

41:58.625 --> 42:00.291
I don't see the higher
meaning in that.

42:01.917 --> 42:04.375

done better with
"Bitch, get in the car."

42:56.291 --> 42:57.875

OAKES: This is the man
who tried to kill you.

43:04.959 --> 43:05.875
We now know that
he's a member

43:06.000 --> 43:08.125
of a multinational
terrorist organization

43:08.208 --> 43:09.917
led by this man.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.917
Meet the man who killed
your brother, Dragan Adjanic.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.291
He's wanted by The Hague
for terrorist crimes
against humanity.

43:16.375 --> 43:20.375
So he's a fugitive
everywhere in the world
including his own country.

43:20.458 --> 43:23.125
He calls his movement
The Black Hand.

43:23.208 --> 43:25.083
His members take
a death pledge,

43:25.166 --> 43:27.625
becoming suicide soldiers
to further their cause.

43:27.709 --> 43:30.417
Last year, the FBI caught
four of his men

43:30.500 --> 43:32.625
in a Washington DC motel,

43:32.709 --> 43:36.250
with enough ureanitrate
to level the Capitol building.

43:36.333 --> 43:38.417
He doesn't like America
and he doesn't like you.

43:38.500 --> 43:39.709
Wait a minute,
what did I do?

43:39.792 --> 43:41.083
He's your rival buyer.

43:41.166 --> 43:42.917
For the item that
this man has to sell.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.458
This is Adrik Vas.

43:44.542 --> 43:46.458
He's a Russian,
ex-army colonel,

43:46.542 --> 43:48.333
kingpin in the
Russian mafia.

43:48.417 --> 43:51.959
He's up to his neck
in prostitution,
drugs and extortion.

43:52.041 --> 43:54.417
That sounds like anybody
I went to high school with.

43:54.500 --> 43:56.000

right-hand man.

about your attackers?

44:30.083 --> 44:31.375

want me to spy,

44:32.542 --> 44:33.875
I'm gonna need
my rest.

44:33.959 --> 44:35.000
How many were there?

44:35.083 --> 44:36.500
Didn't I just say
they woke me up?

44:36.583 --> 44:37.875
Yeah, that's the weird thing
about an ambush.

44:37.959 --> 44:40.000
Next time, we'll try
and warn you.

44:40.083 --> 44:41.709
Do you understand
what happened to you
just now?

44:41.792 --> 44:43.500
Yeah, I was jacked.

44:43.583 --> 44:45.291
OAKES: No, you panicked.

44:45.375 --> 44:46.208
When you thought
you were in danger,

44:46.291 --> 44:47.709
your brain shut down.

44:47.792 --> 44:49.500
So what's the point of having
a good brain

44:49.583 --> 44:51.000
if you can't
keep it operating?

44:51.083 --> 44:52.834
My brain didn't
shut down!

44:52.917 --> 44:53.792
I knew
it was Swanson

44:53.875 --> 44:56.166
'cause I could feel her tits
on my back.

44:57.625 --> 44:59.625
'cause his breath
smelled like shit.

44:59.709 --> 45:01.792
Probably from kissing
your ass so much.

45:01.875 --> 45:03.125
I knew it was Seale

45:03.208 --> 45:04.834
because I took
his wallet.

Hey, Seale, why does
a married man need a condom?

45:07.250 --> 45:08.375

45:09.792 --> 45:11.291
You wanna know
how I knew it was you?

45:11.375 --> 45:12.750
Okay, thank you.
Game's over.

45:12.834 --> 45:14.667
Good night.
Oh, where you going?

45:14.750 --> 45:16.041

Y'all got me up.
Let's do something.

45:20.625 --> 45:22.583
Let's hit a club

intelligence projections

45:31.625 --> 45:34.208

provided by Agent Pope,

45:34.291 --> 45:36.208
this is a mock-up
of what you'll be buying.

45:36.291 --> 45:37.750
Does it play DVDs?

45:37.834 --> 45:40.041
It's a portable
thermonuclear weapon.

45:40.125 --> 45:41.166
So that's a bomb.

45:41.250 --> 45:42.542

in the Ural Mountains.

45:47.291 --> 45:48.542

49:20.333 --> 49:21.625

49:21.709 --> 49:23.792

the computer screen.

49:23.875 --> 49:24.834

49:26.333 --> 49:27.625
Okay, that's it.

49:27.709 --> 49:29.250
All right, from this
point on,

49:29.333 --> 49:32.458
only you will be able
to access your computer.

49:32.542 --> 49:35.792
It won't operate without
your retinal signature,
your eyes.

49:35.875 --> 49:38.125
So, when they show you
the bomb,

49:38.208 --> 49:39.959
connect your laptop.

49:40.041 --> 49:41.917
Determine if the bomb
is the real thing.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.667
And take enough time
doing it,

49:43.750 --> 49:46.166
so Welles can download
their arming codes,

49:46.250 --> 49:48.458
and hopefully their
disarming codes

49:48.542 --> 49:49.834

49:50.709 --> 49:52.333

50:34.208 --> 50:35.667

50:35.750 --> 50:36.709

50:59.166 --> 51:02.667
Gentlemen, are we going
to do business or aren't we?

51:02.750 --> 51:04.208
That depends, Michael.

51:04.291 --> 51:06.375
Where have you been
for the last nine days?

51:06.458 --> 51:08.208
I don't believe
that concerns you.

51:08.291 --> 51:09.917
On the contrary,
it concerns me very much.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.709
We make a deal,
you disappear.

51:12.792 --> 51:14.250

51:52.208 --> 51:53.583
Look, I don't know
what this is about, but...

51:53.667 --> 51:55.792
No, you don't.
So shut up.

51:55.875 --> 51:58.542
Neither does Mr. Turner.

51:58.625 --> 52:02.750
You see, this cell phone
has a global
positioning system.

52:02.834 --> 52:04.250
In a moment,
it'll tell me exactly

52:04.333 --> 52:05.959
where you've been
the last nine days.

52:06.041 --> 52:06.667
Fantastic, eh?

52:09.375 --> 52:11.417
Well, haven't you
been busy?

52:13.041 --> 52:14.667
Oh, you get around.

52:16.375 --> 52:18.417
Berlin, Rome,
Zurich.

52:18.500 --> 52:19.792
(SCOFFING)

52:19.875 --> 52:22.041
And not one decent
treasure to show for it.

52:25.083 --> 52:26.625
Well, where's the money?

52:26.709 --> 52:28.166
Where's the product?

52:28.250 --> 52:29.625
Nearby.

52:29.709 --> 52:32.000
So how do we do this?

52:32.083 --> 52:35.291
I'm gonna call you
on this cell phone.

52:35.375 --> 52:38.083
Then you have one hour
to get the money, Michael.

52:38.166 --> 52:40.500
Then I will call you again
and tell you where
to bring it to.

52:40.583 --> 52:41.583
You understand?

52:41.667 --> 52:43.625
HAYES: Well, I'm gonna
have to run some tests.

52:43.709 --> 52:45.834
So make sure you bring
authentic merchandise.

52:45.917 --> 52:47.500
Fair enough.

52:47.583 --> 52:50.166
I wouldn't buy a car without
checking under the hood.

52:50.250 --> 52:51.458
(CHUCKLES)

52:51.542 --> 52:52.542
Are we agreed?

52:53.125 --> 52:55.000
Yes.

52:55.083 --> 52:58.041
No, we're not bringing
money anywhere.

52:59.917 --> 53:01.500
No?

53:01.583 --> 53:03.500
I'll have someone transfer
the remaining $19 million

53:03.583 --> 53:05.959
when Mr. Turner tells us
we have a viable device.

53:06.041 --> 53:07.792
It can be done
by computer.

53:07.875 --> 53:10.166
One of my men will be
standing by at this address.

53:10.250 --> 53:12.625
You will send one
of your brain trust

53:12.709 --> 53:14.333
to verify the money's
in your account.

53:14.417 --> 53:15.500
And that's it.

53:15.583 --> 53:16.792
We'll give you
a hostage?

53:16.875 --> 53:18.166
Yeah, and
you'll get one.

53:18.250 --> 53:20.041
We'll call it
a security deposit

53:20.125 --> 53:21.000
which neither of us
will get back

53:21.083 --> 53:23.667
if we screw up or
if we leave a mess.

53:23.750 --> 53:24.834
It's that simple.

53:24.917 --> 53:26.583
Now we have an agreement,
I think.

53:28.291 --> 53:29.291
Agreed.

53:32.458 --> 53:34.959
Don't you go disappearing
on me again, Michael.

53:44.750 --> 53:46.625
Hey, you did real well,
Mr. Hayes.

53:48.250 --> 53:49.375
You knew they wouldn't
bring it, right?

53:49.458 --> 53:50.667
Uh-huh.

53:50.750 --> 53:52.375
Standard procedure.

53:52.458 --> 53:54.333

risk getting screwed
on the first date.

53:54.417 --> 53:55.875
Mmm-hmm.

53:55.959 --> 53:58.709
And what if you
hadn't changed
the chip in the phone?

53:58.792 --> 54:00.500
Well, it would have told him
that the phone

54:00.583 --> 54:03.375
had already traveled
to CIA headquarters
in Langley,

54:03.458 --> 54:05.709
and they'd have shot
both of us in the heads.

54:05.792 --> 54:07.000
I'm hungry.
How about you?

01:24:25.166 --> 01:24:26.542
Wrong?
Sir, eventually someone
will break the lock

01:24:26.625 --> 01:24:28.500
and access the code
with or without Jake.

01:24:28.583 --> 01:24:32.208
So basically we, uh...
We must find them before
that happens.

01:24:32.291 --> 01:24:35.542
Well, there is the obvious way
to flush them out.

01:24:35.625 --> 01:24:37.083
We dangle him?

01:24:37.166 --> 01:24:38.500
No. Give him a wire.
They pick him up.

01:24:38.583 --> 01:24:39.875
He gives us a signal
when he sees the nuke.

01:24:39.959 --> 01:24:42.083
Look, if his eyes
get anywhere near

01:24:42.166 --> 01:24:45.250
that computer,
we take everyone out,
including him.

01:24:45.333 --> 01:24:47.583
I need an executive finding
from the President
immediately.

01:24:47.667 --> 01:24:50.041
So he's expendable.
Is that it?

01:24:50.125 --> 01:24:52.750
You need to get the subject
on board. You tell him
whatever you want.

01:24:52.834 --> 01:24:54.250
Subject?

01:24:54.333 --> 01:24:56.542
Oakes, we both know
this is the only way.

01:24:57.333 --> 01:24:58.458
Yeah.

01:24:58.542 --> 01:24:59.917
No!

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.250
No! It ain't
happening! No!

01:25:03.333 --> 01:25:06.542
You want me to be your little,
little worm on a hook!

01:25:06.625 --> 01:25:08.250
They never heard of
Jake Hayes!

01:25:08.333 --> 01:25:10.417
They don't even know
I exist!

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:13.166
Just let me go back to Jersey,
get my girl and disappear!

01:25:14.792 --> 01:25:15.792
Hey, man,

01:25:17.291 --> 01:25:20.250
I'm sorry
I'm not Kevin.

01:25:20.333 --> 01:25:22.333
But even Kevin didn't
make it out of this alive.

01:25:24.166 --> 01:25:25.750
Will you let me
show you something?

01:25:25.834 --> 01:25:26.834
No.

01:25:29.375 --> 01:25:30.417
That's Jersey.

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:31.542
So what?

01:25:33.667 --> 01:25:35.500
OAKES: Okay, let's look
at where you live,
for example.

01:25:35.583 --> 01:25:37.959
Where Julie lives.
Your foster mother.

01:25:38.041 --> 01:25:39.834
These people have
a nuclear bomb, Jake.

01:25:41.333 --> 01:25:42.667
(EXPLOSION)

01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:45.000
The blast alone
will kill thousands.

01:25:45.083 --> 01:25:47.792
Then comes the shock wave...
Blowing away buildings,

01:25:47.875 --> 01:25:49.458
tunnels, bridges.

01:25:49.542 --> 01:25:51.959
And then comes
our old friend, radiation,

01:25:52.041 --> 01:25:53.750
spread by wind and water,

01:25:53.834 --> 01:25:55.417
infecting the living
and the unborn.

01:25:58.750 --> 01:26:01.125
And I think we,

01:26:01.208 --> 01:26:02.333
just you and me,
might have a chance
to stop it.

01:26:02.417 --> 01:26:03.375
That's all I'm saying.

01:26:05.208 --> 01:26:06.917
'Cause they've got us
in check, Mr. Hayes

01:26:09.542 --> 01:26:11.542
and, uh, we can't let them
get checkmate, can we?

01:26:13.458 --> 01:26:14.458
Look...

01:26:17.291 --> 01:26:19.375
The way I see it,
you only got three moves.

01:26:20.917 --> 01:26:21.917
Attack,

01:26:23.709 --> 01:26:27.667
retreat, or block.

01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:29.583
You can't attack,
'cause you don't know
where they are.

01:26:31.583 --> 01:26:33.792
Retreat, boom.

01:26:34.583 --> 01:26:35.583
Then we block.

01:26:36.583 --> 01:26:37.375
You could block.

01:26:39.458 --> 01:26:41.291
But you only got
one piece left.

01:26:43.875 --> 01:26:45.083
And that's a pawn.

01:26:47.583 --> 01:26:50.875
Sir, these gentlemen
wish to see Mr. Turner's
phone records.

01:26:50.959 --> 01:26:52.750
Mr. Turner's phone records
are sealed.

01:26:55.458 --> 01:26:56.250
(GRUNTS)

01:27:02.333 --> 01:27:05.875
Mr. Turner made one phone call
to the United States.

01:27:05.959 --> 01:27:07.166
To Jersey City,
New Jersey.

01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:14.917
Hey! What? No!

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.542
Oh, help!
Help! Help!

01:27:16.625 --> 01:27:18.000
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:19.917
You, what do you want?

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.667
Just take whatever
you want!

What is your connection
to Michael Turner?

01:27:25.917 --> 01:27:28.000
I don't know

01:27:30.667 --> 01:27:32.208
Him.

01:27:32.291 --> 01:27:33.834
That's my boyfriend.
That's Jake.

01:27:36.125 --> 01:27:36.959
Did he sell you
bad tickets?

01:27:44.375 --> 01:27:46.417
You're still there,
right?

01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:48.625
Yes, we're still here,
Mr. Hayes.

01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:50.291
Y'all got guns, right?

01:27:50.375 --> 01:27:52.000
Yes, we have guns,
Mr. Hayes.

01:27:52.834 --> 01:27:54.750
Okay.

01:27:54.834 --> 01:27:56.625
Make sure you got
bullets in 'em.

01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:57.959
Mmm-hmm.
Lots of bullets.

01:28:22.542 --> 01:28:25.792
Or should I call you
Jake, Mr. Hayes?

01:28:25.875 --> 01:28:28.917
You have one chance
of seeing this woman alive.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.959
Take the next

01:28:31.041 --> 01:28:34.291

If you're followed,
she will die.

any authorities, she will die.

Just let me talk to her!

Sorry.
You used Julie!

01:28:50.208 --> 01:28:52.083
She was your pawn, right?
No.

01:28:52.166 --> 01:28:54.792
So all this bullshit
about being something
bigger than you and me

01:28:54.875 --> 01:28:56.750
meant something bigger
than me and Julie, right?

01:28:56.834 --> 01:28:57.959
Will you let me explain?

01:28:58.041 --> 01:28:59.208

I know. If the situation
gets out of hand,

01:30:00.792 --> 01:30:02.250

Now, first of all,
I'm not your son.

Second of all, did it
ever occur to you that
I might want to do somethin'

You know, if you told
a woman right now
at 8:00 in the morning

01:30:25.125 --> 01:30:27.250
that her husband
was sleeping with
Saddam Hussein,

01:30:27.333 --> 01:30:29.917
she'd be able to find Saddam
by 8:00 at night and say,

ever come around

But they're all
honored right here.

01:48:08.667 --> 01:48:10.500
Their names are
written in this book,

their families sign it,
and then the pages
are sealed forever.

01:48:15.250 --> 01:48:17.417

is Carlos Palmeros,

Well, Kevin was responsible
for putting him away.

01:50:34.667 --> 01:50:37.125

you're Kevin so he's coming
after you to kill you.
