00:06.131 --> 00:08.550
You know why I can see

00:06.131 --> 00:08.550
Yonkers' future?

00:08.592 --> 00:10.051
[Axe] 'Cause I can

00:08.592 --> 00:10.051
see its past.

00:10.093 --> 00:13.180
Mike Prince

00:10.093 --> 00:13.180
is Axe's real enemy.

00:13.221 --> 00:16.308
You know the house he

00:13.221 --> 00:16.308
lives in now was my house.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.685
Come on back,

00:16.350 --> 00:17.685
and have dinner with us.

00:17.726 --> 00:18.978
I'll make meatloaf.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.313
Can't wait.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.313
Dinner at home in my hometown.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.732
Only I'm not gonna allow you

00:21.355 --> 00:23.732
to do any work.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.233
I'm gonna bring my chef.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.778
We should do it-- Turn Mase Cap

00:25.275 --> 00:27.778
into an impact fund.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.697
Together. Within Axe Cap.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.697
But ours.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.198
Yes.

00:31.239 --> 00:32.533
[Walker]<i> We were</i>

00:38.205 --> 00:40.165
Oh, I know--

00:38.205 --> 00:40.165

00:40.207 --> 00:41.834
I heard

00:40.207 --> 00:41.834
you were up here.

00:41.876 --> 00:44.795
You know my new artist--Tanner--

00:41.876 --> 00:44.795
I got working on commission.

00:44.837 --> 00:45.921
-[Wendy]<i> Yeah.</i>

00:44.837 --> 00:45.921
-[Axe]<i> He's not working.</i>

00:45.963 --> 00:47.548
You're on the precipice

00:47.589 --> 00:49.967
of the kind of success

00:47.589 --> 00:49.967
very few artists ever have.

00:50.009 --> 00:51.259
Look.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.636
There we go.

00:52.678 --> 00:54.304
You'll be the first

00:52.678 --> 00:54.304
to see it when it's done.

00:54.346 --> 00:55.681
I better be.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.850
I'm fine with you

00:55.723 --> 00:57.850
winning in Yonkers.

00:57.892 --> 00:59.476

But you suddenly

01:10.029 --> 01:11.321

01:11.363 --> 01:13.073

02:19.431 --> 02:20.432
We should fire him.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.142
Then we will.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.142
Will we?

02:22.183 --> 02:23.602
We said

02:22.183 --> 02:23.602
no exceptions.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.187
The exact words were:

02:23.644 --> 02:26.187
"Strive for no exceptions."

02:26.229 --> 02:29.108
Meaning--

02:26.229 --> 02:29.108
So Winston's the perfect fit.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.567
You said--

02:29.149 --> 02:30.567
No.

02:30.609 --> 02:32.653
Winston's Tony Stewart

02:30.609 --> 02:32.653

02:32.694 --> 02:35.697
Cocky 'cause he drives fast,

02:32.694 --> 02:35.697
but too brazen, too cutthroat.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.699
He'll punch you on pit row,

02:35.739 --> 02:37.699
or run you over.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.409
But like Stewart,

02:37.741 --> 02:39.409
he gets results.

02:39.451 --> 02:40.661
Sure.

02:39.451 --> 02:40.661
At Taylor Mason Capital.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.454
But we're building

02:40.702 --> 02:42.454
something new.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.666
Tell me he sees the Matrix

02:42.496 --> 02:45.666
and we're done here.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.542
I can't tell you

02:45.707 --> 02:47.542
he sees the Matrix.

02:47.584 --> 02:50.045
I saw the Matrix before they

02:47.584 --> 02:50.045
even made the fucking movie!

02:50.087 --> 02:52.006
And I was like

02:50.087 --> 02:52.006
five years old then.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.298
Rest my case.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.383
Wait, you really want

02:53.340 --> 02:55.383
to fire me?

02:55.425 --> 02:56.885
I thought I was gonna get

02:55.425 --> 02:56.885
a two percent slice

02:56.927 --> 02:58.553
of the new company.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.555
Dave Mustaine thought

02:58.595 --> 03:00.555
he would return to Metallica.

03:00.597 --> 03:04.434
I get the new slogan:

03:00.597 --> 03:04.434
No more ass-pounding the planet.

03:04.476 --> 03:05.936
Earth-positive approach.

03:05.978 --> 03:07.980
We go to Phish concerts

03:05.978 --> 03:07.980
with our investors.

03:08.022 --> 03:10.774
But we still love money

03:08.022 --> 03:10.774
too, right?

03:10.816 --> 03:12.985
The math works the same

03:10.816 --> 03:12.985
no matter the names we own.

03:13.027 --> 03:15.779
And that is where

03:13.027 --> 03:15.779
you will always need me.

03:15.821 --> 03:18.657
"Need."

03:15.821 --> 03:18.657
Again, that overstates it.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.117
Sell us on what you alone

05:49.850 --> 05:52.435
There may be legal remedies.

was a pain-in-the-ass fan.

Of course.

43:51.045 --> 43:53.089

43:51.045 --> 43:53.089
Doesn't need saying.

43:55.007 --> 43:58.261
And while we're talking

43:55.007 --> 43:58.261

43:58.303 --> 44:00.388
I've only gotten a taste

43:58.303 --> 44:00.388
of this new venture,

44:00.430 --> 44:03.349
but I am energized and fucking

44:00.430 --> 44:03.349
inspired to be involved.

44:03.391 --> 44:05.977
Is that so?

44:03.391 --> 44:05.977
Because I think--

44:06.018 --> 44:08.938
Lauren,

44:06.018 --> 44:08.938
I asked you not to do this.

44:08.980 --> 44:11.941
Yeah, well, I asked you

44:08.980 --> 44:11.941
not to trust her blindly.

44:11.983 --> 44:15.153
Looks like we both

44:11.983 --> 44:15.153
ignored the requests.

44:15.194 --> 44:18.781

44:15.194 --> 44:18.781
leads to 25% of my piece.

44:18.823 --> 44:19.991
Yes. I think that's fair--

44:20.032 --> 44:21.700
Which is why

44:20.032 --> 44:21.700
I'm giving you 40.

44:21.742 --> 44:23.286
[Taylor] I need to be senior,

44:23.328 --> 44:25.455
but I need you fully invested

44:23.328 --> 44:25.455
and without doubt.

44:25.497 --> 44:28.082
And are you?

44:25.497 --> 44:28.082
Without doubt?

44:28.124 --> 44:30.418
There's uncertainty in almost

44:28.124 --> 44:30.418
everything that comes next.

44:30.460 --> 44:32.420
The essence of our job

44:30.460 --> 44:32.420
is to overcome that

44:32.462 --> 44:34.046
and take calculated risks.

44:34.088 --> 44:36.299
But in this moment, I'm sure

44:34.088 --> 44:36.299
there's no way forward

44:36.341 --> 44:38.801
