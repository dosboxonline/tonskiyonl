I got to take this, it's gayle.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.418
Her cats don't like
the new litter

07:41.545 --> 07:43.211
And I said
I'd help mediate on speaker.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.838
Linda, you can't stop
in the middle.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.339
I'm gonna lose my goose bumps.

07:46.425 --> 07:48.216
Uh, hey, m-maybe bob
can finish it.

07:48.343 --> 07:49.885
-He, uh, saw it, too.
-What?

07:49.928 --> 07:52.554
-Uh, no, I-I... I can't.
-Sure you can.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.098
It's the latest<i> scream</i> one.
The one with the bean dip?

07:55.225 --> 07:56.892
-Okay... Uh, fine.
-Yay.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.935
I'm on, gayle.
Can everyone hear me?

07:59.021 --> 08:00.604
-Hi, it's aunt linda...
-Uh, okay, so,

08:00.731 --> 08:04.357
Uh, um, uh, the-the babysitter
is waiting for the guy.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.443
And, uh, she looks
out the window,

08:06.528 --> 08:09.362
And there-there's, um,
a-a different guy there.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.406
Uh, maybe I'll wait for linda.

08:11.492 --> 08:12.782
No offense,
but you're ruining it.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.284
No, no, no,
I-I just thought of...

08:14.369 --> 08:15.952
I, uh, remembered what happened.

08:16.038 --> 08:17.662
-I-I got it.
-Doesn't seem like it.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.122
Uh, then, her "boyfriend"

08:19.208 --> 08:21.124
<i> Comes back and sits down</i>
<i> next to her.</i>

08:21.210 --> 08:23.668
<i> And he hands her a bowl</i>
<i> and a tortilla chip.</i>

08:23.795 --> 08:25.170
-[teddy]<i> yeah?</i>
-[bob]<i> and she looks down,</i>

08:25.297 --> 08:29.174
<i> And it's not bean dip,</i>
<i>it's her boyfriend's intestines!</i>

08:29.259 --> 08:30.634
-Aah!
-A-and just then,

08:30.761 --> 08:32.260
<i> The high school glee club</i>
<i> pulls up in a van,</i>

08:32.387 --> 08:34.179
<i> And they're all singing</i>
<i> a cappella,</i>

08:34.306 --> 08:36.139
<i> -So they don't hear her</i>
<i> screaming.</i>
-[distant scream]

08:36.225 --> 08:38.808
Their singing blends
with her screams, teddy.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.519
-It harmonizes.
-Oh, my god.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.687
This is the best movie
I've never seen.

08:42.731 --> 08:44.272
[bob]
I just felt so alive, lin.

08:44.399 --> 08:45.690
I didn't know where I was going,

08:45.817 --> 08:47.150
I just knew
I was gonna get there.

08:47.236 --> 08:48.360
I mean, some of your details

08:48.445 --> 08:50.445
Were a little much,
what I heard.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.364
Like, the blood
dripping off the machete

08:52.449 --> 08:54.241
Making the killer flash back
to a melting ice cream cone

08:54.284 --> 08:55.367
His mother bought him?

08:55.494 --> 08:57.077
-I mean, come on.
-That's symbolism.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.662
-That's just craft.
-Stupid.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.830
Hey, my cute stuffs,
how was school?

09:00.958 --> 09:02.707
Good. I reported
on a computer game

09:02.834 --> 09:04.459
That tells you all about
yourself and now

09:04.545 --> 09:05.835
"the tina table's"
back on top, baby!

09:05.963 --> 09:07.671
But does it tell us
about ourselves?

09:07.798 --> 09:08.964
I mean, it's a computer,

09:09.049 --> 09:10.340
It probably
knows what it's doing.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.842
-Huh. Me, a conformist?
-Well...

09:12.928 --> 09:15.136
It said I'm
a "studious bookworm."

09:15.222 --> 09:16.763
There, see? Uh, wait.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.431
People do have hidden qualities.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.684
Like, I didn't know
until today that I was

09:20.769 --> 09:23.436
-A master horror storyteller.
-Here we go.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.854
I got to do a follow-up
on that game.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.273
It's total "table" candy.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.985
And I got to go studiously
use the toilet. Sir, madam.

09:30.112 --> 09:32.737
<i> My exposé into how banana</i>
<i> and kiwi smoothies</i>

09:32.823 --> 09:34.155
<i> Taste together is being cut</i>

09:34.241 --> 09:36.408
<i> To bring you</i>
<i> an expanded "tina table."</i>

09:36.535 --> 09:39.619
<i> And I'm cool with that</i>
<i> because the game says</i>

09:39.705 --> 09:42.414
<i> I'm easygoing and generous.</i>

09:42.499 --> 09:45.250
<i> Welcome back, mr. Frond.</i>
<i> New look?</i>

09:45.335 --> 09:47.168
<i> It's tech visionary-ish.</i>

09:47.254 --> 09:48.837
<i> Same with the stubble.</i>

09:48.872 --> 09:51.172
<i> -Not seeing any stubble, but--</i>
<i> -it-it... It's there.</i>

09:51.258 --> 09:53.550
<i> -So,</i> the final frond-tier--
<i> -thanks for asking, tina.</i>

09:53.677 --> 09:55.719
<i> I am honored to announce</i>
<i> my proposal</i>

09:55.804 --> 09:59.431

<i> And unattended emotional</i>
<i> diagnostic center.</i>

10:02.144 --> 10:05.604
<i> Catchy? So, can you talk more</i>
<i> about how the game works?</i>

10:05.689 --> 10:07.856
<i> Uh, you know,</i>
<i> the computer computes.</i>

10:07.941 --> 10:10.275
-[tina]<i> uh-huh.</i>
<i> -Excuse the jargon.</i>

10:10.360 --> 10:11.693
<i> And can you say anything</i>
<i> about those top-notch</i>

10:11.820 --> 10:13.111
<i> Software developers</i>
<i> you mentioned?</i>

10:13.238 --> 10:14.571
<i>So, what you're basically asking</i>

10:14.698 --> 10:17.115
<i> Is what does it feel like</i>
<i> to change the world?</i>

10:17.200 --> 10:18.700
<i> To disrupt the paradigm?</i>

10:18.869 --> 10:22.329
<i>-That wasn't really what I was--</i>
<i> -it feels humbling</i>

10:22.456 --> 10:25.040
<i> -Slash nobel-ish?</i>
-[scoffs]

10:25.083 --> 10:26.583
Hey, tina, great interview,

10:26.668 --> 10:28.168
But what's with
the tough questions?

10:28.253 --> 10:31.171
You do remember the first rule
of tv journalism, right?

10:31.340 --> 10:33.423
-Floss?
-Keep it puffy and fun.

10:33.592 --> 10:34.758
Which I call "fuffy."

10:34.843 --> 10:36.384
But isn't it sort of weird
that mr. Frond

10:36.511 --> 10:38.678
-Won't even answer how he--
-uh, ah-ah-ah.

10:38.805 --> 10:39.929
[chuckles]
that's not fuffy.

10:40.057 --> 10:41.598
Plus, I played
<i> the final frond-tier,</i>

10:41.683 --> 10:43.725
And it told me I have
major trust issues, tina.

10:43.852 --> 10:47.228
So from now on, I'm just
believing anything anyone says.

11:16.301 --> 11:17.258
[jocelyn]
hi, I'm letting you know

11:17.386 --> 11:19.260
My birthday party is canceled.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.970
I'm so sad,
but I'm an introvert.

11:21.098 --> 11:23.223
Hey, jimmy junior,
want to wrestle me over there

11:23.308 --> 11:24.557
In front of chloe barbash?

11:24.643 --> 11:26.309
Gotta warn you, I'm aggressive.

11:26.395 --> 11:27.811
-[shouts] ow.
-I don't want to wrestle,

11:27.896 --> 11:29.688
But I would discuss
my vulnerabilities with you.

11:29.815 --> 11:31.272
-Does that help?
-Mm.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.982
Okay, things
are a little off, but...

11:33.068 --> 11:34.526
Kids are told
some crap about themselves

11:34.611 --> 11:37.237
And believe it just because
a video game said so?

11:37.364 --> 11:39.197
It's like that thing, uh,

11:39.324 --> 11:41.282
With the pill
that doesn't do anything.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.910
-Tic tacs?
-Placebo. The placebo effect.

11:43.995 --> 11:46.204
And come on--
top-notch software people?

11:46.331 --> 11:48.123
Do we really think
mr. Frond's gonna

11:48.208 --> 11:49.666
Get ahold of top-notch anything?

11:49.751 --> 11:50.959
Hey, there's mr. Frond now.

11:51.086 --> 11:53.044
Walking out carrying
a bunch of juice boxes.

11:53.171 --> 11:54.963
-Must be nice.
-Hmm.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.506
I've got sugar.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.341
I don't want any more sugar.
I just want

11:58.468 --> 12:00.635
To take a break,
see the outside world.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.053
Not too outside, but still.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.222
You can take a break when
the stupid game works, henry.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.182
We can't keep faking it forever.

12:06.268 --> 12:07.559
-[tina] faking it?
-Aah!

12:07.644 --> 12:09.018
Mr. Frond!

12:09.187 --> 12:10.687
Also, are those juice boxes
spoken for?

12:14.735 --> 12:16.818
I knew it!<i> Final frond-tier.</i>
More like<i> fraud-tier.</i>

12:16.945 --> 12:19.404
It was all fake? And your
top-notch software developers

12:19.531 --> 12:21.156
Are a 13-year-old boy?

12:21.241 --> 12:22.240
I work in a school.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.033
It's not like I meet any adults.

12:24.161 --> 12:25.952
Mr. Frond
wanted a quick prototype

12:26.037 --> 12:27.120
To show principal spoors.

12:27.205 --> 12:28.705
I cranked it out over recess

12:28.832 --> 12:31.207
In exchange for pizza
and a college recommendation.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.585
But it's just a beta
with no back end.

12:33.712 --> 12:36.129
Excuse me, our father's
a beta with no back end.

12:36.214 --> 12:39.424
He had me fake your results
to look good on air, tina.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.426
Everybody else has
gotten something random

12:41.553 --> 12:42.510
I took off the internet.

12:42.596 --> 12:43.928
But, mr. Frond, why?

12:44.097 --> 12:46.473
I was gonna finish the game,
but then spoors wanted it

12:46.558 --> 12:48.475
Right away so I was like,
"okay, cool."

12:48.560 --> 12:50.477
Well, I hope you don't
mind open containers,

12:50.562 --> 12:52.687
'cause tina's gonna
blow the lid off this.

12:52.814 --> 12:53.980
You can't prove anything.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.107
And henry signed
a nondisclosure agreement.

12:56.193 --> 12:58.151
I really should have run that
by my lawyer.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.402
My lawyer's my mom.

12:59.488 --> 13:01.613
Besides, tina,
we've both benefited.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.198
It's a great story.

13:03.241 --> 13:06.117
And henry's probably just
one pizza away from finishing

13:06.203 --> 13:08.203
The nerd part, and I'll do
the psychobabble part.

13:08.330 --> 13:10.079
Psychobabble,
qu'est-ce que c'est?

13:10.123 --> 13:11.498
And, hey, principal spoors
is in talks

13:11.625 --> 13:13.082
With the superintendent
to roll out the game

13:13.210 --> 13:15.168
Across the whole
school district.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.711
I could announce
it on "the tina table."

13:16.838 --> 13:20.256
The only thing that's gonna roll
is your head, mr. Frond.

13:20.383 --> 13:22.342
Tina, this is when we leave.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.135
With all the sass
you can muster.

13:24.262 --> 13:27.472
-[groans]
-oh, zero sass.

13:27.599 --> 13:28.681
A different approach.

13:28.767 --> 13:29.933
[teddy]
so there's a lot of buzz

13:30.060 --> 13:31.351
About this new one
that's streaming--

13:31.478 --> 13:33.686
<i> Subcutaneous evil.</i>
I heard the director

13:33.814 --> 13:35.146
Is from around here someplace.

13:35.232 --> 13:36.314
I think they're even gonna do

13:36.441 --> 13:37.774
A special screening
with the guy.

13:37.901 --> 13:38.650
I'll tell it.
I saw it last night.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.151
Or I could tell it,

13:40.237 --> 13:41.569
'cause we saw it
together, right?

13:41.655 --> 13:43.154
Yeah, but I noticed
you were kinda nodding off

13:43.240 --> 13:44.614
During the fun,
interesting parts,

13:44.699 --> 13:46.866
And then woke up for the
long-winded, heavy-handed parts.

13:46.910 --> 13:49.160
Hmm. That's funny 'cause
I remember you being awake for

13:49.246 --> 13:51.746
More of the tangential stuff
that took the movie off track.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.706
-[linda scoffs]
-you guys sound like
you need to get more sleep.

13:53.834 --> 13:54.958
So, it's set
in a french village

13:55.085 --> 13:55.959
<i> In the middle ages.</i>

13:56.086 --> 13:57.043
<i> We hear latin chanting.</i>

13:57.128 --> 13:58.670
<i> It's a midnight exorcism.</i>

13:58.797 --> 14:00.880
<i> Then a scream,</i>
<i> and the priest is flung out</i>

14:00.966 --> 14:02.215
<i> A stained glass window.</i>

14:02.300 --> 14:04.217
<i> [linda] then the camera</i>
<i> pulls back and we see</i>

14:04.302 --> 14:06.803
<i> This is all just a dumb movie</i>
<i> a bunch of hot college kids</i>

14:06.888 --> 14:08.471
<i> Are watching on tv at a cabin.</i>

14:08.598 --> 14:09.973
<i> And they turn it off and say,</i>
<i> "that's the worst movie</i>

14:10.100 --> 14:12.267
<i> -We've ever seen."</i>
-[teddy]<i> classic.</i>

14:12.352 --> 14:14.561
[linda]
<i> then the girl who looks like</i>
<i> a young meg ryan but dances</i>

14:14.688 --> 14:16.312
<i> Like a young jennifer grey--</i>
<i> that comes up later--</i>

14:16.439 --> 14:18.398
<i> Says, "where are</i>
<i> the extra-pointy</i>

14:18.483 --> 14:20.191
<i>Marshmallow skewers we brought?"</i>

14:20.277 --> 14:22.110
<i> -[bob] but it doesn't matter</i>
<i>because she drops through a hole</i>

14:22.195 --> 14:24.404
<i> In the floor that leads to</i>
<i> another dimension. A dumb one.</i>

14:24.489 --> 14:26.865
<i> Meanwhile, there's an ancient</i>
<i> monastery next door...</i>

14:26.992 --> 14:28.324
[linda]<i> that's suddenly hit</i>
<i> by a meteor,</i>

14:28.493 --> 14:29.701
<i> -And there's nothing left.</i>
-[bob]<i> mm.</i>

14:29.828 --> 14:31.202
This movie's wild.
I love it.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.704
[tina]
I don't know what to do!

14:32.789 --> 14:34.080
If I take the game down
on the air,

14:34.165 --> 14:35.915
That's not very fuffy
and I could lose the show.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.292
And are things
really that bad now?

14:37.377 --> 14:38.793
Tammy's much
less awful than usual.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.212
And-and jimmy junior's been
very emotionally available.

14:41.298 --> 14:43.423
Last night he had me on
the phone for an hour telling me

14:43.592 --> 14:45.550
About every time he's cried
since he was six years old.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.051
It was a little much,
actually, but...

14:47.137 --> 14:49.470
Tina, mr. Frond
is messing with nature.

14:49.598 --> 14:52.098
I heard andy and ollie
peed in separate urinals.

14:52.183 --> 14:54.309
And ms. Twitchell says
I need to work on reducing

14:54.394 --> 14:56.686
My classroom participation.
Is that bad?

14:56.813 --> 14:58.980
Ugh! I wish I had someone
to talk to who's

14:59.065 --> 15:00.440
Been in this situation.

15:00.525 --> 15:01.566
Oh! Maybe you can.

15:01.693 --> 15:02.942
So, keep it fuffy,

15:03.028 --> 15:04.569
Or tell it like it is
and lose everything?

15:04.654 --> 15:05.820
What do you think, pam?

15:05.906 --> 15:07.822
It's kind of
all up to you now.

15:07.949 --> 15:10.116
[pam]
<i> so you're not my postmates?</i>

15:10.201 --> 15:11.826
No, it's tina, gene and louise.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.119
Again, we've met a few times.

15:13.204 --> 15:14.495
<i> And you got my address how?</i>

15:14.623 --> 15:16.789
We called the station
and said we were you,

15:16.917 --> 15:18.082
And we forgot our address.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.335
<i> Great. Look, um, tina,</i>

15:20.495 --> 15:22.503
<i> I think, inside,</i>
<i> you already know what to do.</i>

15:22.589 --> 15:25.214
<i> Tv journalism</i>
<i> is a sacred trust.</i>

15:25.300 --> 15:28.217
<i> When I left channel 13,</i>
<i> all I had was my pride.</i>

15:28.303 --> 15:32.180
<i> I was scared. I didn't know</i>
<i> if there was life after tv.</i>

15:32.265 --> 15:33.640
<i> -And you know what?</i>
-Yeah?

15:33.767 --> 15:35.099
<i> -There isn't.</i>
-What?
-What?

15:35.226 --> 15:36.884
<i> Not being on tv sucks.</i>

15:36.978 --> 15:38.895
<i> It's 4:00</i>
<i> and I'm not even dressed yet.</i>

15:38.980 --> 15:41.898
<i> I don't remember when I put</i>
<i> on this sweatshirt. Monday?</i>

15:41.983 --> 15:43.975
<i> You need to do</i>
<i> whatever you can</i>

15:44.027 --> 15:45.360
<i> To stay on that box.</i>

15:45.487 --> 15:46.235
Okay, bye, pam.

15:46.363 --> 15:48.237
<i> Do you guys see my postmates?</i>

15:48.365 --> 15:49.322
So, uh, great.

15:49.407 --> 15:51.115
We know not
to listen to her, right?

15:51.201 --> 15:52.909
Tina, don't listen to pam.

15:52.994 --> 15:54.786
Tina? Tina.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.789
I'm, uh, I'm glad
you came to your senses.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.374
This is a win-win for us both.

15:59.501 --> 16:01.918
-Right.
-How's my cat hair situation?

16:02.003 --> 16:04.170
-Bad.
-Darn it.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.343
Guys, we're on in five.
Big smiles.

16:10.387 --> 16:11.511
The news is about smiles.

16:11.554 --> 16:12.637
Tina, please,

16:12.764 --> 16:13.763
-You have to stop him.
-Louise, no.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.515
-I'm keeping it fuffy.
-Ugh.

16:15.600 --> 16:16.766
Is she allowed in here?

16:16.893 --> 16:18.977
Uh, she is not.
Tammy, some muscle?

16:19.104 --> 16:20.395
Mm.
Sorry, you have to go.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.605
Do you want one of
my pre-show banana chips?

16:22.691 --> 16:24.065
-I'm generous.
-Ugh!

16:24.150 --> 16:26.192
Oh, I missed a call
from teddy last night.

16:26.277 --> 16:27.694
-Like a booty call?
-What?

16:27.779 --> 16:29.070
Like when
your booty accidentally

16:29.197 --> 16:30.905
Calls someone from your pocket.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.366
Lin, that's not--
there's a message. Oh, no.

16:33.535 --> 16:34.367
-Oh, no.
-What?

16:34.494 --> 16:35.827
He said he was
about to head out

16:35.870 --> 16:36.953
To that special
director's screening

16:37.080 --> 16:38.371
Of<i> subcutaneous evil.</i>

16:38.456 --> 16:40.081
But-but we already
told him the movie.

16:40.250 --> 16:43.209
He said we made it sound
so exciting he had to go see it.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.335
Damn it, we're too good.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.087
Now he knows
we made everything up.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.798
-What are we gonna do?
-I don't know. Should we move?

16:48.883 --> 16:50.299
Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.634
-[entry bells jingle]
-aah!
-Aah!

16:51.761 --> 16:54.679
-Bob, linda.
-Teddy, hi.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.222
-Hey, buddy.
-[weak chuckle]

16:56.307 --> 16:58.349
Uh, so, uh, di-did you
go to that screening

16:58.435 --> 17:00.560
Or-or bail
at the last minute, maybe?

17:00.645 --> 17:03.104
-No, I went to it, bob.
-Great, great, great.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.023
-Oh, good.
-I bet that was like

17:05.108 --> 17:07.692
A director's cut, uh,
with, uh, all new scenes.

17:07.777 --> 17:10.445
-Probably felt like a different
movie, even, right?
-It did.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.530
That came up later
at the q and a.

17:12.615 --> 17:13.906
Hi. Hello.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.117
Uh, my question is, uh,
what the hell is going on?!

17:16.202 --> 17:18.911
Yeah, right, and my follow-up
is why are you lying?!

17:19.039 --> 17:20.747
-Okay, that--
-where's the real movie?!

17:20.832 --> 17:22.040
Why?
Why'd you do it?

17:22.167 --> 17:23.082
We're so sorry, teddy.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.500
We just couldn't keep up.

17:24.586 --> 17:26.377
We've got kids,
we go to bed early.

17:26.463 --> 17:27.545
And it was fun?

17:27.630 --> 17:29.464
Eh, yeah, I get it.

17:29.591 --> 17:31.174
-You do?
-Actually...

17:31.259 --> 17:34.218
I was sitting there last night
and, sure, I was terrified.

17:34.304 --> 17:36.137
But I was kind of bored, too.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.764
You were bored and terrified?

17:37.891 --> 17:39.849
Yeah, it was so formulaic.

17:39.934 --> 17:41.809
No magic.
Your movie was way better.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.603
Aw.
But who told it better?

17:43.688 --> 17:46.981
Well, you both have a style
that adds a certain charm.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.108
-Right. But seriously.
-Yeah.
-Uh...

17:49.194 --> 17:50.568
-I mean...
-I mean, come on.
-Uh...

17:50.695 --> 17:51.903
-Say it.
-Don't make me choose!

17:52.030 --> 17:53.571
-Okay, okay.
-All right, all right.
-Anyway,

17:53.656 --> 17:55.073
Hey, there's this new
<i> Halloween</i> movie.

17:55.158 --> 17:56.157
You guys see it?

17:56.284 --> 17:57.366
-We saw it.
-Yeah, we saw it.

17:57.494 --> 17:58.743
So... What happens?

17:58.828 --> 18:00.244
It's set a hundred years ago.

18:00.371 --> 18:02.330
-And michael myers'
great-great-grandfather
-yeah?

18:02.415 --> 18:04.707
Also escapes
from an insane asylum.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.460
[linda] and it's valentine's
day and he's in love.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.754
[bob] Halloween takes place
on valentine's day?

18:09.839 --> 18:11.339
[teddy] wow! A twist already.

18:11.466 --> 18:13.633
So, we're in talks
and soon, kids

18:13.760 --> 18:15.635
All over the school
district will be playing

18:15.720 --> 18:18.137
<i> -The final frond-tier.</i>
-Great.

18:18.223 --> 18:20.181
Hey, why don't you play
<i> the final frond-tier</i>

18:20.308 --> 18:21.641
Right here on "the tina table"?

18:21.768 --> 18:23.142
Me play?
That's fun.

18:23.228 --> 18:24.811
Creator playing his creation.

18:24.896 --> 18:27.021
-Fuffy. I like it.
-Uh, let's see.

18:27.107 --> 18:30.483
A mutiny has broken out
on one of the convoy ships.

18:30.568 --> 18:34.403
Uh-oh, mutiny. He just
got handed a hot potato.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.906
<i> -[game chimes]</i>
<i> -oh, no.</i>
<i> Everyone got space cholera.</i>

18:36.991 --> 18:38.741
<i> Darn.</i>
<i> Well, that happens.</i>

18:38.868 --> 18:41.077
<i> -Let's hear your profile.</i>
-[computer] evaluating.

18:41.246 --> 18:44.288
<i> You are unstable and amoral.</i>

18:44.374 --> 18:45.456
Probably dangerous.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.333
Wha... [weak chuckle]
it's-it's a glitch.

18:47.418 --> 18:50.837
<i> Something to work on:</i>
<i> Staying away from everyone.</i>

18:50.964 --> 18:52.171
I always knew.

18:52.257 --> 18:53.422
No. [chuckles]
it's-it's wrong.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.423
It's-it's a bug.

18:54.509 --> 18:55.967
Kids have been playing
all week.

18:56.094 --> 18:58.386
-How could it be a bug?
-Well, it's still in beta.

18:58.513 --> 19:00.054
But it's rolling
out district-wide.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.514
Is it ready or not, mr. Frond?

19:01.641 --> 19:03.933
Of course it is.
I-I'm disrupting the paradigm.

19:04.018 --> 19:06.060
I'm... [groans]
no one tells you

19:06.187 --> 19:07.520
How hot these things are.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.856
-[whimpers]
-well?

19:09.941 --> 19:11.566
All right.
It's all lies!

19:11.651 --> 19:13.943
<i> The game just says</i>
<i> random gibberish.</i>

19:14.070 --> 19:15.987
<i> It's-it's all a big lie.</i>

19:16.072 --> 19:18.531
Phew. It was exhausting
being aggressive.

19:18.575 --> 19:19.740
Oh, thank god. I'm great,

19:19.826 --> 19:21.033
Everyone else is...
[blows raspberry]

19:21.119 --> 19:23.369
-[phone chiming]
-crap. It's principal spoors.

19:23.454 --> 19:24.579
I'll just let it go
to voice mail.

19:24.664 --> 19:25.663
I think he's watching us live

19:25.790 --> 19:27.957
-Right now in his office.
-Oh f--

19:28.126 --> 19:31.043
I can't believe mr. Frond
said "fart" on the air.

19:31.171 --> 19:32.211
Ye-yes sir, I...

19:32.297 --> 19:33.462
I understand.
We tell the school board

19:33.590 --> 19:35.423
You were just kidding
about the rollout,

19:35.550 --> 19:37.675
And I-I won't touch
the computers anymore.

19:37.802 --> 19:40.136
And I'll change out of
the turtleneck immediately.

19:40.221 --> 19:41.637
But your neck is better turtled.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.389
I thought you were
on my side, tina.

19:43.474 --> 19:44.891
You and louise argued about it.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.809
Fake fight.
To get you to drop your guard.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.519
I was gonna change the world.

19:48.646 --> 19:49.687
You could have been part of it.

19:49.814 --> 19:50.938
But if you have
to lie and cheat

19:51.024 --> 19:52.481
And cut corners
to change the world,

19:52.567 --> 19:54.275
Wh-what kind of world
are you left with anyway?

19:54.360 --> 19:56.110
Crap, I wish I'd thought of that
on the air.

19:56.237 --> 19:58.070
You're right.
You're right!

19:58.156 --> 19:59.614
Weird vibe over here.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.032
So, great buzz on the "table."

20:01.201 --> 20:04.118
It was courageous
but also fun but also newsy.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.162
Which I've decided
to call "curfuewsy."

20:06.247 --> 20:07.830
-That saves time.
-Curfuewsy!

20:07.957 --> 20:09.248
If you say it twice,
I don't know

20:09.334 --> 20:10.458
If it still saves time.
It's fine.

20:10.585 --> 20:12.501
Tina, how did you know
the game would say

20:12.587 --> 20:13.669
All that stuff about me?

20:13.755 --> 20:14.962
-I took care of that part.
-[gasps]

20:15.048 --> 20:17.215
Like you had henry
fix my results.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.635
And now,
I'm free of you forever.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.345
But you're still gonna write

20:22.472 --> 20:23.888
My college
recommendation, right?

20:23.973 --> 20:25.139
Yeah, fine.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.016
Party's back on.
Don't wear that, though.

20:27.101 --> 20:29.352
Party's back on.
Just you, not you, sorry.

20:29.479 --> 20:31.896
Hey, tina, I know we blocked
out two hours tonight

20:31.940 --> 20:33.814
To talk about times
I felt stuff.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.359
-Yeah, um...
-But zeke got new sneakers

20:36.402 --> 20:37.944
That make a cool squeaky sound,

20:38.029 --> 20:40.821
So I was gonna watch him
do some sneaker squeaks.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.698
-I'm gonna squeak out!
-Oh, phew.

20:42.825 --> 20:44.742
-I mean, cool.
-[both laughing]

20:44.869 --> 20:46.202
The game was right
about one thing.

20:46.329 --> 20:47.828
Tina, you are
kind of a truth finder.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.498
-And I'm bookish.
-No. Uh-uh.
-No. Hey, mr. Branca.

20:50.625 --> 20:53.584
Next "tina table"--
you, me, dustpans?

20:53.670 --> 20:54.919
I'll bring my favorite one.

20:55.004 --> 20:56.712
-You know what I named it?
-Dusty?

20:56.872 --> 20:58.089
