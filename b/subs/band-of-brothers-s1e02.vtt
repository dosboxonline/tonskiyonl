WEBVTT

00:13.221 --> 00:14.931
(theme music playing)

02:29.649 --> 02:30.733
I, uh--

02:30.817 --> 02:32.569
Standing in the door
I could see...

02:32.652 --> 02:35.905
the lights
on the drop zone,

02:35.989 --> 02:39.033
and I had to assume
that was our drop zone,

02:39.117 --> 02:41.202
way in the...
ahead of us.

02:41.286 --> 02:47.208
And... so that
we had the red light,

02:47.292 --> 02:51.462
I had everybody standing up
ready to jump,

02:51.546 --> 02:54.549
so, when the plane
started to get hit,

02:54.632 --> 02:57.927
and suddenly the pilot
gives me the green light,

02:58.011 --> 03:00.430
I'm out the door,
immediately.

03:00.513 --> 03:04.309
We got such an opening blast
from the opening shot,

03:04.392 --> 03:07.896
from the prop-blast
that it broke this chin strap

03:07.979 --> 03:10.273
that we had
on this helmet of mine,

03:10.356 --> 03:14.694
and that's when I lost
this famous leg-bag

03:14.777 --> 03:16.654
that everybody
talks about,

03:16.738 --> 03:18.990
just from the shock
of the opening.

03:19.073 --> 03:21.993
It just flew
right off my foot.

03:22.076 --> 03:24.579
We came from the sky.

03:24.662 --> 03:28.666
We hit, and in any
direction you went

03:28.750 --> 03:30.919
there would be enemy,
you knew it.

03:31.002 --> 03:34.964
And that was all part
of what you accepted.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.635
How do you prepare yourself,
mentally?

03:38.718 --> 03:41.304
Each man must
do that himself.

03:41.387 --> 03:45.308
Each man must
prepare himself mentally,

03:45.391 --> 03:49.312
to, uh, to make that jump.

03:49.395 --> 03:52.190
At the back of your mind
you-- you know, you wonder

03:52.273 --> 03:53.900
what's gonna happen
and all that.

03:53.983 --> 03:56.611
You know you've been trained
and trained and trained

03:56.694 --> 03:58.696
and what your job
is gonna be,

03:58.780 --> 04:00.782
and what you're
supposed to do and--

04:00.865 --> 04:03.117
Oh, that's what you
gotta think about, you know?

04:03.201 --> 04:06.537
And we lost a lot
of people that night,

04:06.621 --> 04:12.168
but... you try to put it
all out of your mind.

05:08.141 --> 05:12.395
Smith, give me a light.

05:43.134 --> 05:46.220
Lip, did Evans make it?

05:46.304 --> 05:47.430
Yes, sir.

05:47.513 --> 05:50.349
He's in
Lieutenant Meehan's
stick, sir.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.485
Paratrooper 1:
Lieutenant Meehan!

06:00.568 --> 06:02.737
Lieutenant Meehan.

06:02.820 --> 06:05.156
Will could
use some help.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.749
Will.

06:14.832 --> 06:16.334
Will, hey.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.836
Will, I need
your help here.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.454
(radio chatter)

07:49.302 --> 07:51.095
Get ready!

07:52.138 --> 07:54.640
Stand up!

07:55.808 --> 07:57.393
Hook up!

07:59.395 --> 08:01.606
Equipment check!

08:07.445 --> 08:09.447
Sound off
for equipment check!

08:09.530 --> 08:10.531
Paratrooper 2:
Ten okay!

08:10.615 --> 08:11.574
Paratrooper 3:
Nine okay!

08:11.657 --> 08:12.658
Eight okay!

08:12.742 --> 08:13.659
Seven okay!

08:13.743 --> 08:15.369
Six okay!

08:13.743 --> 08:15.369
Five okay!

08:15.453 --> 08:16.537
Paratrooper 4:
Four okay!

08:16.621 --> 08:17.705
Paratrooper 5:
Three okay!

08:17.788 --> 08:18.873
Two okay!

08:18.956 --> 08:20.208
One okay!

08:31.761 --> 08:33.262
(grunts)

08:34.764 --> 08:36.057
(men shouting)

08:55.826 --> 08:58.162
Jesus Christ!
Let's go, let's go!

08:58.246 --> 08:59.580
Does that light
look green to you?

08:59.664 --> 09:01.332
No, let's go!

09:01.415 --> 09:04.794
I'm hit!
Ahh!

09:15.721 --> 09:18.516
Jesus, tell Meehan
to get them out of there!

09:26.399 --> 09:27.817
Ahh!

09:31.195 --> 09:32.905
Two o'clock!

09:32.989 --> 09:35.366
Oh, Jesus Christ!

10:00.599 --> 10:02.435
Go!

10:00.599 --> 10:02.435
I wanna jump, sir!

10:02.518 --> 10:05.646
Now, listen to me,
stay on the plane,

10:02.518 --> 10:05.646
Get up! Move!

10:05.730 --> 10:07.064
You're not jumping!

10:08.065 --> 10:09.442
He's okay.

10:09.525 --> 10:10.735
No, sir, no!

10:10.818 --> 10:13.487
All right, sonofabitch.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.031
(grunts)

10:27.835 --> 10:29.545
Where's
the goddamn D.Z.?

10:29.628 --> 10:32.673
Maybe it's three
more minutes on this bearing!

10:32.757 --> 10:34.050
We get any lower,

10:34.133 --> 10:36.218
we ain't gonna need
any friggin' parachutes!

10:36.302 --> 10:37.636
Slow down!

10:37.720 --> 10:39.764
We gotta get
some altitude!

10:39.847 --> 10:42.433
They can't jump
at this speed!

10:43.476 --> 10:44.977
We there?

10:46.604 --> 10:47.980
Oh god!

10:48.064 --> 10:49.273
Oh no!

10:49.357 --> 10:50.608
Oh!

10:52.777 --> 10:55.279
Let's go!

11:23.682 --> 11:25.810
(gunshots)

11:43.744 --> 11:44.787
Flash!

11:44.870 --> 11:45.913
Shit!

11:45.996 --> 11:49.291
I don't think that's
the correct reply, Trooper.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.627
I say "flash,"
you say "thunder."

11:51.710 --> 11:53.838
Yes, sir,
thunder, sir.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.635
Musette bag.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.140
Coach?

12:04.223 --> 12:05.933
Sir, it's Hall, sir.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.726
I was on
the basketball team.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.145
Leg-bag?

12:09.228 --> 12:10.813
Prop blast got it, sir,

12:10.896 --> 12:12.815
and my radio
and batteries with it.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.275
Mine, too.

12:14.358 --> 12:16.861
Mine are somewhere
behind those trees.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.198
Okay.

12:22.658 --> 12:24.368
Follow me.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.206
(gunshots)

12:31.292 --> 12:33.669
To hell with that!

12:55.733 --> 12:58.068
Wait until they reload.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.030
(men shouting)

13:01.113 --> 13:02.573
Go.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.953
Aren't you
"D" Company?

13:08.037 --> 13:10.748
Able, sir.

13:10.831 --> 13:14.627
Guess that means
one of us is in the wrong
drop zone, sir?

13:14.710 --> 13:16.879
Yeah, or both of us.

13:18.005 --> 13:19.798
Do you have
a weapon, sir?

13:19.882 --> 13:21.634
Just my knife.

13:23.719 --> 13:27.848
Do you have any idea
where we are, sir?

13:30.518 --> 13:32.311
Some.

13:34.021 --> 13:36.315
So, you're
a radio man?

13:36.398 --> 13:37.775
Yes, sir.

13:37.858 --> 13:40.611
Well, I was until
I lost my radio on the jump.

13:40.694 --> 13:42.780
I'm sure I'll get
chewed out for that.

13:42.863 --> 13:45.324
Well, if you were
in my platoon,

13:45.407 --> 13:48.494
I'd tell you
you were a rifleman first
and a radio man second.

13:48.577 --> 13:51.080
Well, maybe you could
tell that to my platoon leader

13:51.163 --> 13:52.748
when we find him.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.458
If we find him.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.502
It's a deal.

13:56.585 --> 13:58.587
First, I need
your help.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.924
We'll locate some landmarks
to get our bearings.

14:02.007 --> 14:06.345
Keep your eyes peeled
for buildings, farmhouses,

14:06.428 --> 14:09.890
bridges, roads, trees.

14:14.186 --> 14:17.314
I wonder if the rest of them
are as lost as we are.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.650
We're not lost,
Private.

14:19.733 --> 14:22.027
We're in Normandy.

14:59.356 --> 15:00.816
Who's that?

15:00.899 --> 15:03.652
Lieutenant Winters,
is that you?

15:07.406 --> 15:09.033
Get in here,
sit down.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.284
Any weapon?

15:10.367 --> 15:13.245
No, sir. As soon as
I hit that prop blast,
so long leg-bag.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.289
All I got is this knife
and some TNT.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.583
These 82nd boys
got their M-1s, though.

15:17.666 --> 15:19.752
Oh, man, 82nd,
where the hell are we?

15:19.835 --> 15:22.171
Sir, I saw a sign
back thataways,

15:22.254 --> 15:24.465
said, "Sainte-MÃ¨re-Eglise."

15:31.096 --> 15:32.973
Flashlight.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.184
Raincoat?

15:35.267 --> 15:36.393
You got a raincoat?

15:36.477 --> 15:37.895
Yeah.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.796
We're about seven kilometers
away from our objective.

16:03.879 --> 16:06.340
And four hours away
from when we need
to have it secured.

16:06.423 --> 16:10.636
So, we got a lot
of walking ahead of us.

16:10.719 --> 16:13.389
You men will stick with us
until we find your unit.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.265
Let's go.

16:16.183 --> 16:17.393
Hey, Sarge,
where are we going?

16:17.476 --> 16:19.269
Causeway number two,
Utah Beach.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.896
The Germans flooded
the fields inland.

16:20.979 --> 16:22.898
We don't clear those routes,
our boys ain't going nowhere.

16:22.981 --> 16:24.692
Five of us
ain't gonna secure a road.

16:24.775 --> 16:28.028
That louie don't even
have a weapon.

16:28.112 --> 16:31.198
I don't remember hearing
about any railroads
near our objective.

16:31.281 --> 16:32.408
I'm telling you,

16:32.491 --> 16:34.785
this is the spur line
that runs parallel
to the river.

16:34.868 --> 16:36.995
We should be coming up
to a road and bridge ahead.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.205
Yeah, how would
you know?

16:38.288 --> 16:40.999
Because I studied
sandtails, all right?

16:45.003 --> 16:46.797
Probably
a friggin' train or--

16:46.880 --> 16:47.965
Shh.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.091
Winters:
Flash.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.092
Thunder.

16:52.219 --> 16:54.138
Lieutenant,
is that you?

16:54.221 --> 16:55.347
Malarkey?

16:55.431 --> 16:56.598
Sir.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.058
Glad to see you, sir.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.058
Hey, fellas.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.893
Everybody okay?

16:58.142 --> 16:59.893
Hey, Lieu. Good to see you.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.311
Nice to see you guys.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.896
Guarnere.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.896
Sir.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.857
You and Hall up front.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.026
Who the hell is Hall?

17:26.336 --> 17:29.465
(horse neighing)

17:40.517 --> 17:41.560
Lipton.

17:41.643 --> 17:42.603
Go.

17:42.686 --> 17:43.729
Guarnere.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.321
(horse neighing)

17:52.404 --> 17:53.697
(men chattering)

18:05.876 --> 18:08.045
Wait for my command.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.549
(men chattering)

18:19.723 --> 18:20.808
(gunfire)

18:20.891 --> 18:21.975
(horses neighing)

18:22.059 --> 18:24.144
(men shouting)

18:30.275 --> 18:32.778
Grenade! Grenade!

18:34.863 --> 18:36.031
(speaking foreign language)

18:41.578 --> 18:42.704
Ahh!

18:49.962 --> 18:52.506
That's enough,
Guarnere!

18:54.466 --> 18:55.717
Everyone okay?

18:55.801 --> 18:57.135
All:
Yes, sir.

18:58.136 --> 19:00.681
Next time I say
wait for my command,

19:00.764 --> 19:02.558
you wait for my command,
Sergeant.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.228
Yes, sir.

19:06.311 --> 19:07.938
(horse neighing)

19:08.021 --> 19:09.314
(gunshot)

19:12.818 --> 19:14.695
Here you go,
Lieutenant.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.488
Kraut weapon.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.702
Fine, Quaker.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.625
What's that
guy's problem?

19:28.709 --> 19:29.710
Gonorrhea.

19:29.793 --> 19:30.961
Really?

19:31.044 --> 19:34.298
His name, dummy,
Guarnere, gonorrhea, get it?

19:34.381 --> 19:37.426
So besides
having a shitty name,
what's his problem?

19:37.509 --> 19:41.555
None of your
fucking business, cowboy.

19:41.638 --> 19:43.432
Lieutenant:
All right, let's move out.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.850
Paratroopers:
Sir.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.602
Quietly.

20:04.161 --> 20:05.746
Did you see him?
He just sat there.

20:05.829 --> 20:08.457
He didn't
have a weapon.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.125
What's he gonna do,
shout at 'em?

20:10.208 --> 20:11.835
Shouts at me
for killing Krauts.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.922
He just wanted you
to wait for his command.

20:15.005 --> 20:17.758
Joe, he don't
even drink.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.480
(cow moos)

20:36.026 --> 20:38.111
Lipton, Wynn.

21:17.484 --> 21:21.029
Anybody need supplies or ammo,
now's the time to get it.

21:26.284 --> 21:28.704
McDowell, you okay?

21:28.787 --> 21:29.830
Yes, Sergeant.

21:29.913 --> 21:31.081
Then let's go.

21:41.008 --> 21:44.011
Hey, I promised my kid brother
I'd fetch him back a Luger.

21:44.094 --> 21:45.303
So I got
first dibs, okay?

21:45.387 --> 21:47.055
Check that one.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.391
(planes soaring)

21:52.602 --> 21:53.603
It's the Navy.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.022
The landings have started,
let's go.

21:55.105 --> 21:56.189
Let's move it out.

21:56.273 --> 21:57.190
Right on time.

21:57.274 --> 21:59.234
Yeah, tell that
to him, cowboy.

21:59.317 --> 22:00.777
My name's Hall.

22:00.861 --> 22:01.903
That so?

22:01.987 --> 22:03.155
Let's move out.

22:03.238 --> 22:06.074
You just gotta learn
to return his fire is all.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.868
You gotta realize
it ain't about you.

22:07.951 --> 22:09.036
He just heard
his brother--

22:09.119 --> 22:10.537
Malarkey,
shut your yap.

22:12.831 --> 22:13.874
His brother got it
at Cassino.

22:13.957 --> 22:15.667
Found out
before we jumped.

22:20.547 --> 22:22.174
(indistinct chatter)

22:30.265 --> 22:31.308
Morning, sir.

22:31.391 --> 22:33.977
Battalion sure will be happy
to see you guys.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.062
Where?

22:35.145 --> 22:36.104
At the farm, sir.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.814
Top of the morning
to you fellas.

22:37.898 --> 22:39.024
Enjoying the war?

22:39.107 --> 22:40.108
(laughter)

22:40.192 --> 22:41.860
Where are you from, son?

22:42.944 --> 22:44.905
Eugene, Oregon.

22:46.531 --> 22:47.741
Eugene?

22:47.824 --> 22:49.076
You gotta be kidding me.

22:49.159 --> 22:50.410
Popeye,
did you hear this?

22:50.494 --> 22:51.953
I'm from Astoria.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.288
You don't say.

22:53.371 --> 22:55.207
Yeah, Orange Street.

22:55.290 --> 22:56.750
What gives?

22:56.833 --> 22:58.835
What-- What are you doing
in a Kraut uniform?

22:58.919 --> 23:00.128
<i>Volksdeutsche.</i>

23:00.212 --> 23:01.463
Come again?

23:02.756 --> 23:04.299
My family
answered the call.

23:04.382 --> 23:07.219
"All true Aryans should
return to the Fatherland."

23:07.302 --> 23:09.262
Joined up in '41.

23:09.346 --> 23:11.056
You're shitting me, right?

23:11.139 --> 23:14.184
Toye:
Hey, Malarkey, stop
fraternizing with the enemy.

23:14.267 --> 23:15.310
Get over here!

23:15.394 --> 23:18.188
What got you to Eugene?

23:18.271 --> 23:19.648
I was born in Eugene.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.149
Really?

23:21.233 --> 23:23.026
(chattering)

23:33.745 --> 23:35.288
Popeye.

23:36.289 --> 23:37.457
Hey, Popeye.

23:39.376 --> 23:40.794
Hey, Harry.

23:40.877 --> 23:42.212
Carry on.

23:42.295 --> 23:44.005
Oh, Easy Company.

23:44.089 --> 23:45.382
(all greeting each other)

23:45.465 --> 23:46.633
Welcome.

23:46.716 --> 23:48.093
Good to see you.

23:48.176 --> 23:50.178
And this here's Hall,
Able Company.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.721
Known as Cowboy.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.014
You from Texas?

23:53.098 --> 23:54.766
Manhattan.

23:56.059 --> 23:57.310
Hey, Boss,
how ya doin'?

23:57.394 --> 23:58.687
What's goin' on?

23:58.770 --> 24:00.480
What's the hold up?

23:58.770 --> 24:00.480
Not sure.

24:00.564 --> 24:01.898
(explosion)

24:01.982 --> 24:04.025
Five'll get you 10,
it's got something
to do with that.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.360
Yeah.

24:05.443 --> 24:07.320
It's good
to see you, Dick.

24:07.404 --> 24:08.655
Yeah,
you too, Buck.

24:08.738 --> 24:10.490
What's the situation?

24:10.574 --> 24:11.491
Ah, not good.

24:11.575 --> 24:14.202
90% of the men are
still unaccounted for.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.453
Lieutenant Meehan?

24:15.537 --> 24:17.998
No, no one's seen him,
or anyone from his plane.

24:18.081 --> 24:20.167
You know,
if he is missing,

24:20.250 --> 24:22.669
wouldn't that
put you in line to be
the next Commander of Easy?

24:27.841 --> 24:29.217
Hey, Lieutenant Speirs.

24:31.011 --> 24:34.055
How many men have
Dog Company got assembled?

24:34.139 --> 24:36.224
A handful,
maybe 20.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.435
You the only officer
that made it?

24:38.518 --> 24:39.477
So far.

24:39.561 --> 24:42.022
Still waiting
for orders.

24:42.105 --> 24:44.858
You got
some cigarettes?

24:44.941 --> 24:46.318
Here.

24:48.987 --> 24:50.363
Hey, keep the pack.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.240
Yeah, so I was
in the plant in '39.

24:52.324 --> 24:56.077
That's when I was at Monarch
tooling propeller shafts.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.287
No kiddin'.

24:57.370 --> 24:58.663
What are the chances
of that, huh?

24:58.747 --> 25:00.373
You and me 100 miles
from each other,

25:00.457 --> 25:02.375
working at practically
the same job, geez.

25:02.459 --> 25:04.794
Hey, Malark,
we're waiting on you.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.087
Yeah, I'm coming.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.965
Well, I gotta run,
I'll see you around.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.676
Yeah, see you around.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.940
<i>Zigaretten?</i>

25:27.275 --> 25:29.361
Here you go.

25:29.444 --> 25:31.655
(speaking German)

25:31.738 --> 25:32.948
<i>Danke.</i>

25:35.659 --> 25:37.077
<i>Danke.</i>

25:39.829 --> 25:40.956
Thank you.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.251
(gunshots)

25:50.966 --> 25:52.300
Shit.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.345
Soldier:
Easy Company?

25:55.428 --> 25:56.721
Easy?

25:58.056 --> 26:00.809
Hey, any of you guys know
where Easy Company is?

26:02.227 --> 26:03.395
You seen
Lieutenant Meehan?

26:03.478 --> 26:04.646
No, not yet.

26:04.729 --> 26:07.774
Well, Major Strayer wants
Easy Company's C.O. up front.

26:07.857 --> 26:10.443
Well, I guess
that means you, Dick.

26:10.527 --> 26:11.611
(explosion)

26:10.527 --> 26:11.611
C'mon.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.196
Sonofabitch.

26:15.699 --> 26:17.909
Hey, Malark,
where's the best chow?

26:19.703 --> 26:21.288
In Berlin.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.086
Let's round them up.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.086
Okay, get up.

26:29.254 --> 26:30.505
And the MGs?

26:30.588 --> 26:32.132
I'd say right
around here, sir.

26:32.215 --> 26:33.883
I can't be sure.

26:35.468 --> 26:37.137
There's some
Kraut 88s up ahead.

26:37.220 --> 26:39.931
Up ahead and to the right
about what, 300 yards?

26:40.015 --> 26:41.391
Up through
those gardens.

26:41.474 --> 26:43.935
Now, they're right between us
and Causeway number two.

26:44.019 --> 26:46.521
Firing on to the boys
landing at Utah.

26:46.604 --> 26:47.647
Think Easy
can handle it?

26:47.731 --> 26:49.149
Yes, sir.

26:49.232 --> 26:51.526
'Cause my guess is
they're doing some
terrible damage there.

26:51.609 --> 26:52.861
(explosion)

26:53.987 --> 26:55.405
(chattering)

26:59.409 --> 27:00.660
The 88s
we've been hearing,

27:00.744 --> 27:04.831
have been spotted in a field,
down the road aways.

27:04.914 --> 27:08.793
Major Strayer wants us
to take 'em out.

27:08.877 --> 27:12.589
There are two guns
that we know of
firing on Utah Beach,

27:12.672 --> 27:16.092
and plan on a third
and a fourth,

27:16.176 --> 27:17.719
here and here.

27:17.802 --> 27:19.179
The Germans
are in the trenches,

27:19.262 --> 27:22.849
with access
to the entire battery,

27:22.932 --> 27:24.851
and with machine-gun cover
in the rear.

27:24.934 --> 27:26.561
We'll establish
a base of fire

27:26.644 --> 27:30.190
and move under it
hard and fast with
two squads of three.

27:30.273 --> 27:32.442
How many Krauts
they think we're facing?

27:32.525 --> 27:34.361
No idea.

27:34.444 --> 27:36.738
No idea?

27:39.157 --> 27:42.869
We'll take some
TNT along with us,
to spike the guns.

27:42.952 --> 27:44.704
Lipton, your responsibility.

27:42.952 --> 27:44.704
Yes, sir.

27:44.788 --> 27:47.374
Liebgott, you'll take
the first machine-gun

27:47.457 --> 27:49.417
with Petty A. Gunner.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.378
Plesha, Hendrix,
you take the other.

27:51.461 --> 27:52.754
Who does
that leave?

27:53.755 --> 27:56.883
Compton, Malarkey,
Toye, Guarnere.

27:56.966 --> 27:57.884
Okay.

27:57.967 --> 28:00.428
we'll be making
the main assault.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.679
Understood?

28:01.763 --> 28:02.889
All:
Yes, sir.

28:02.972 --> 28:06.226
All right,
let's pack it up, boys.

28:06.309 --> 28:09.062
Shouldn't he be outside with
the other Able Company guys?

28:09.145 --> 28:11.272
See you around, Hall.

28:16.861 --> 28:20.156
Lipton, when you see
we've captured the first gun,

28:20.240 --> 28:22.659
I want you and your TNT
as fast as possible.

28:22.742 --> 28:24.911
Yes, sir.

28:24.994 --> 28:28.581
Okay, just weapons and ammo,
drop everything else.

28:28.665 --> 28:31.376
Got any spare ammo
in a pack or a musette bag,

28:31.459 --> 28:33.002
bring it along.

28:33.086 --> 28:34.045
Lieutenant, sir?

28:34.129 --> 28:36.798
I was wondering, sir,
you need an extra hand?

28:36.881 --> 28:38.466
Ain't you Sink's
jeep driver?

28:38.550 --> 28:39.551
So?

28:39.634 --> 28:40.635
Oh, shit.

28:40.718 --> 28:42.137
What's your name,
trooper?

28:42.220 --> 28:44.180
Lorraine, sir.

28:44.264 --> 28:45.432
You're with me,
Lorraine.

28:46.641 --> 28:48.935
Compton, Second Squad.

28:46.641 --> 28:48.935
Yes, sir.

28:49.018 --> 28:51.396
All right, you heard the word,
let's move, let's move.

29:28.475 --> 29:29.976
Go.

29:32.437 --> 29:33.354
Three cannons.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.607
(cannons firing)

29:40.612 --> 29:43.656
Petty,
we've got enfilading fire.

29:43.740 --> 29:44.908
Right, let's go.

29:44.991 --> 29:46.201
Stay down.

29:57.712 --> 29:59.005
(soldiers shouting in German)

29:59.088 --> 30:01.216
MG-42s.

30:01.299 --> 30:03.551
I'll draw their fire
to the right from the truck.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.678
Take two men
and hit 'em from the left.

30:05.762 --> 30:06.804
Okay, go.

30:05.762 --> 30:06.804
Right.

30:13.937 --> 30:16.523
Take Ranney, envelop right,
give covering fire.

30:16.606 --> 30:18.525
Lorraine,
on the machine-gun.

30:18.608 --> 30:20.777
Don't give away your position
until you have to.

30:20.860 --> 30:22.612
And I want that TNT

30:22.695 --> 30:24.447
as soon as you see
we've captured the first gun.

30:24.531 --> 30:25.698
Go.

30:24.531 --> 30:25.698
Yes, sir.

30:31.287 --> 30:32.789
(explosions)

30:41.589 --> 30:43.216
(speaking in German)

30:44.384 --> 30:46.177
Go.

30:46.261 --> 30:47.387
(shouting)

30:52.183 --> 30:53.893
I can't see nothing.

30:53.977 --> 30:56.813
(shouting in German)

31:34.475 --> 31:36.060
(shouting continues)

31:43.901 --> 31:45.737
C'mon, Buck.

31:54.078 --> 31:55.330
(shouting in German)

32:13.014 --> 32:14.182
Oh, shit!

32:20.438 --> 32:21.397
Let's go!

32:21.481 --> 32:22.440
Let's go!

32:22.523 --> 32:24.233
Follow me!

32:33.242 --> 32:34.577
Come on!

32:36.746 --> 32:38.122
Oh, fuck!

32:38.206 --> 32:39.957
It just got my ass!

32:40.041 --> 32:42.669
(indistinct shouting)

32:45.129 --> 32:46.381
Sorry, sir.

32:50.176 --> 32:51.344
Jesus Christ!

32:56.307 --> 32:58.142
Fucking jeep jockey.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.228
Shit, I'm sorry, sir.

33:00.311 --> 33:01.604
I screwed up.

33:05.316 --> 33:06.859
Grenade!

33:06.943 --> 33:09.529
Joe, Toye,
roll out, roll out!

33:12.907 --> 33:14.242
God!

33:14.325 --> 33:15.201
Shoot.

33:15.284 --> 33:17.203
You are one
lucky bastard, Joe.

33:25.962 --> 33:29.340
Guarnere, Malarkey, Lorraine,
secure that gun!

33:32.510 --> 33:34.095
Compton,
covering fire.

33:34.178 --> 33:35.680
Yes, sir!

33:47.400 --> 33:48.359
Where are
you hit, Pop?

33:48.443 --> 33:51.070
I can't believe
I fucked up my ass, sir.

33:51.154 --> 33:52.321
Your ass?

33:55.074 --> 33:56.200
Oh, shit.

33:56.284 --> 33:57.368
Hey, Popeye,
how bad is it?

33:57.452 --> 33:59.203
I'm sorry, sir,
I didn't mean to fuck up.

33:59.287 --> 34:01.914
I don't think
it's too bad.

34:03.624 --> 34:05.293
You think you can
make it back yourself?

34:05.376 --> 34:06.419
I think so, sir.

34:06.502 --> 34:07.837
Let's move out.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.255
Right, here we go.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.255
Okay.

34:09.338 --> 34:10.965
Drop your weapon, Pop,
drop your weapon.

34:11.048 --> 34:12.008
Yeah.

34:12.091 --> 34:13.009
C'mon!

34:13.092 --> 34:14.927
One, two, three!

34:15.887 --> 34:17.972
Get down, Dick,
get down!

34:18.056 --> 34:19.390
Pop!

34:21.184 --> 34:22.518
Popeye, get down!

34:24.896 --> 34:27.065
Winters, one o'clock!

34:28.733 --> 34:30.526
Grenade! Toye!

34:30.610 --> 34:32.403
Let's go!
Get out of there!

34:32.487 --> 34:33.529
Get out of there!

34:35.156 --> 34:36.157
Toye!

34:37.784 --> 34:38.701
Joe!

34:38.785 --> 34:40.203
Jesus Christ.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.997
Fucking twice.

34:46.042 --> 34:48.628
Jesus Christ!

34:50.755 --> 34:53.174
Lorraine, move! Go!

34:53.257 --> 34:55.134
Malark!

35:02.099 --> 35:03.559
Ranney, let's move!

35:03.643 --> 35:05.269
They've got
the first gun.

35:12.902 --> 35:14.028
There's the second gun.

35:14.111 --> 35:15.488
Grenades first.

35:15.571 --> 35:17.031
Then keep going, go!

35:17.114 --> 35:18.157
Right.

35:24.413 --> 35:25.832
Okay.

35:28.251 --> 35:29.752
(shouting)

35:36.008 --> 35:37.552
<i>Nicht schieben!</i>
<i>Nicht schieben!</i>

35:37.635 --> 35:39.053
(speaking in German)

35:37.635 --> 35:39.053
Shut up.

35:39.136 --> 35:40.096
<i>Nicht schieben!</i>

35:40.179 --> 35:41.055
No make dead!

35:41.138 --> 35:42.223
Shut up.

35:41.138 --> 35:42.223
<i>Nicht schieben!</i>

35:42.306 --> 35:43.933
<i>Nicht schieben!</i>

35:42.306 --> 35:43.933
Shut the fuck up!

35:44.016 --> 35:45.434
No make dead.

35:45.518 --> 35:47.019
(speaking in German)

35:51.357 --> 35:53.442
Toye, stay down, stay down!

35:54.485 --> 35:57.113
Compton!

35:54.485 --> 35:57.113
Buck:
All right, cover for me.

36:00.032 --> 36:01.534
We must be doing
something right.

36:01.617 --> 36:03.828
Look, we got 'em
so confused they're
firing on their third gun.

36:03.911 --> 36:06.706
We better blow this thing
before they figure out
what the hell's happening.

36:06.789 --> 36:08.249
I'm gonna go and see
what's keeping Lipton.

36:08.332 --> 36:11.168
All right. Toye,
cover the lieutenant!

36:15.047 --> 36:17.174
I think one of those
dead Krauts has a Luger.

36:17.258 --> 36:18.301
So what?

36:18.384 --> 36:19.510
Keep your head low, Petty.

36:19.594 --> 36:20.595
C'mon, move it!

36:20.678 --> 36:23.014
Have a little suppressing
fire, why don't you?

36:23.097 --> 36:24.891
Jesus Christ!

36:25.892 --> 36:27.059
Malarkey!

36:29.896 --> 36:31.063
Now you stop firing?

36:31.147 --> 36:32.148
Beautiful.

36:32.231 --> 36:33.274
Shit.

36:33.357 --> 36:35.276
Christ, they must think
he's a medic or something.

36:35.359 --> 36:36.861
He's gonna need
a goddamn medic.

36:36.944 --> 36:39.322
Okay, okay, okay.

36:40.239 --> 36:41.782
Liebgott:
Malarkey!

36:43.451 --> 36:44.577
Stay low!

36:45.828 --> 36:48.372
What the hell
are you doin'? C'mon!

36:53.878 --> 36:55.129
Forgot your
friggin' Luger?

36:55.212 --> 36:58.799
You want I should go get it
for you, you stupid Mick?

37:01.219 --> 37:03.512
Where's Lipton
with that TNT?

37:03.596 --> 37:04.764
Don't know, sir.

37:05.765 --> 37:06.807
You'll be all right, Popeye.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.184
I'm sorry,
I messed up.

37:08.267 --> 37:09.226
Don't be sorry.

37:09.310 --> 37:10.394
Hey, Sarge?

37:09.310 --> 37:10.394
Yeah.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.146
You think this is
a ticket home?

37:12.230 --> 37:13.272
Maybe.

37:13.356 --> 37:15.816
Shit,
I just got here.

37:21.948 --> 37:23.199
Hiya, cowboy.

37:23.282 --> 37:26.160
Shut your fucking
guinea trap, gonorrhea.

37:26.243 --> 37:28.079
He's all right,
that kid.

37:28.162 --> 37:30.331
Jesus, you got a whole
Kraut platoon out there.

37:30.414 --> 37:31.791
Probably more,
Captain.

37:31.874 --> 37:32.792
You need help?

37:32.875 --> 37:35.252
I need ammo, sir,
lots of it!

37:35.336 --> 37:37.129
And TNT!

37:37.213 --> 37:38.547
I've got TNT, sir.

37:38.631 --> 37:40.841
Good job,
Private.

37:48.599 --> 37:50.184
Hall, ready!

37:50.268 --> 37:53.270
Sir, I don't have
any way to set it off, sir.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.374
Fire in the hole!

38:17.586 --> 38:19.672
Plesha,
covering fire.

38:19.755 --> 38:21.132
Third gun, here!

38:21.215 --> 38:24.051
Lorraine, grab some more
of those potato mashers
and follow me.

38:24.135 --> 38:27.096
Malarkey, Hall,
you two, go!

38:45.656 --> 38:48.159
Running a little low
on ammo, sir.

38:48.242 --> 38:49.410
How about you,
Malarkey?

38:49.493 --> 38:50.369
Okay.

38:50.453 --> 38:53.205
Think you got enough
to take the third gun?

38:53.289 --> 38:54.790
We'll soon
find out, Dick.

38:54.874 --> 38:56.083
Malarkey, let's go!

38:56.167 --> 38:57.793
Toye, cover!

38:57.877 --> 39:01.088
Okay, Hall,
keep your head down.

39:02.089 --> 39:03.090
Hall!

39:03.174 --> 39:05.301
Leave your TNT!

39:14.101 --> 39:16.145
Fire in the hole!

39:21.817 --> 39:23.069
Malarkey,
cover the front!

39:23.152 --> 39:24.361
Go to the cannon, go.

39:56.894 --> 39:57.770
Hey, Sarge.

39:57.853 --> 39:59.814
I'm looking for
Battalion Headquarters.

39:59.897 --> 40:01.107
Are you kidding?

40:01.190 --> 40:02.775
It's back that away.

40:02.858 --> 40:04.068
You mean over--

40:07.613 --> 40:09.532
Winters:
Fire in the hole!

40:13.702 --> 40:16.205
(German radio chatter)

40:21.544 --> 40:22.920
Lipton:
TNT!

40:23.921 --> 40:25.506
TNT!

40:25.589 --> 40:26.882
Don't need it.

40:26.966 --> 40:28.050
What?

40:28.134 --> 40:29.552
Don't need it!

40:29.635 --> 40:31.387
Hall!

40:31.470 --> 40:33.264
Hall?

40:35.182 --> 40:37.810
Where'd he come from?

40:40.980 --> 40:43.816
Winters, Hester said
you needed ammo!

40:43.899 --> 40:44.859
Malarkey!

40:44.942 --> 40:47.820
As much as you can,
everyone!

40:49.113 --> 40:51.991
You mind if "D" Company
takes a shot at the next gun?

40:52.074 --> 40:53.284
All yours.

40:53.367 --> 40:55.327
Let's go,
Dog Company!

40:55.411 --> 40:57.329
Up and at 'em,
"D" Company.

40:57.413 --> 40:58.581
Compton!

40:59.748 --> 41:00.875
Who is that, Speirs?

41:00.958 --> 41:02.626
Out! Get out!

41:07.548 --> 41:09.258
What's he doing
out of the trench?

41:10.342 --> 41:11.677
Oh, what the hell's
he doing?

41:11.760 --> 41:13.721
(shouting)

41:13.804 --> 41:15.681
Oh, Jesus.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.730
Sir, had a little trouble

41:22.813 --> 41:24.607
getting through
that first field.

41:27.109 --> 41:28.277
Oh, Christ.

41:28.360 --> 41:29.987
We're gonna need it
at the next gun.

41:30.070 --> 41:31.780
Once it's blown,
tell 'em to pull out. Go!

41:31.864 --> 41:32.865
Yes, sir.

41:35.242 --> 41:37.453
Compton, police them both,
then pull out!

41:37.536 --> 41:39.580
Lorraine, Toye,
move out!

41:48.505 --> 41:49.590
Move out!

41:49.673 --> 41:51.008
Move out!
Move it out!

41:51.091 --> 41:53.761
MGs first.

41:53.844 --> 41:55.638
Fall back to your
original positions.

41:55.721 --> 42:00.059
Everyone else,
maintain your base of fire.

42:05.314 --> 42:06.607
Okay, back
to battalion!

42:06.690 --> 42:08.067
Go, go!

42:08.150 --> 42:09.485
(shouting)

42:19.536 --> 42:21.288
They were 105s,
not 88s, sir.

42:21.372 --> 42:22.790
We disabled them
and pulled out.

42:22.873 --> 42:25.292
I figure there's
maybe 40 or so Krauts

42:25.376 --> 42:27.670
still manning three MG-42s
to the rear.

42:27.753 --> 42:28.921
Hey, Popeye.

42:29.004 --> 42:30.381
Watch it,
watch it. Coming through.

42:30.464 --> 42:31.465
40?

42:31.548 --> 42:32.591
Yes, sir.

42:32.675 --> 42:35.135
We killed
maybe around 20,

42:35.219 --> 42:37.805
so, yeah, probably
there's 40 left.

42:37.888 --> 42:39.974
I think
we need artillery,

42:40.057 --> 42:42.559
or maybe mortars
might do the job.

42:56.282 --> 42:57.574
Going my way?

42:57.658 --> 42:58.701
Sure.

42:59.702 --> 43:00.828
Sir.

43:01.745 --> 43:04.206
Careful,
don't hurt yourself.

43:05.833 --> 43:07.751
Nice ride
you got here, Nix.

43:07.835 --> 43:09.545
Straight
from Utah Beach.

43:09.628 --> 43:12.298
We should put 'em to work
before they're missed.

43:19.888 --> 43:21.140
Winters:
<i>By nightfall,</i>

43:21.223 --> 43:23.517
<i>Second Battalion had secured</i>
<i>Sainte-Marie-du-Mont,</i>

43:23.600 --> 43:25.185
<i>and elements</i>
<i>of the 4th Division</i>

43:25.269 --> 43:28.147
<i>were beginning to move</i>
<i>men and material inland.</i>

43:31.233 --> 43:34.445
<i>Most of the 101st Airborne,</i>
<i>including Easy Company,</i>

43:34.528 --> 43:36.614
<i>were still scattered</i>
<i>all over Normandy,</i>

43:36.697 --> 43:39.158
<i>and the success</i>
<i>of the invasion was far</i>
<i>from certain.</i>

43:39.241 --> 43:40.576
<i>We had an hour to rest</i>

43:40.659 --> 43:42.328
<i>and scrounge</i>
<i>whatever food we could</i>

43:42.411 --> 43:43.829
<i>before we had</i>
<i>to move south</i>

43:43.912 --> 43:45.914
<i>and secure the town</i>
<i>of Culoville.</i>

43:49.835 --> 43:53.213
Liebgott:
I don't wanna die in the back
of this damn truck, is what.

43:53.297 --> 43:54.673
C'mon, you're
stepping on my legs.

43:54.757 --> 43:57.384
Jesus, let me out of here.

43:57.468 --> 43:59.303
Light, light discipline.

43:59.386 --> 44:00.679
Guarnere,
close that flap.

44:00.763 --> 44:04.058
Let the Krauts cook
their own goddamn food.

44:05.225 --> 44:06.393
How are we doing,
Malark?

44:06.477 --> 44:07.978
we're doing good.

44:06.477 --> 44:07.978
Doing good?

44:08.062 --> 44:10.189
Yeah.

44:08.062 --> 44:10.189
What the hell do you know
about cooking? You're Irish.

44:10.272 --> 44:11.899
Sir, if you have
a reservation someplace else,

44:11.982 --> 44:13.817
I'd be happy to go with you.

44:11.982 --> 44:13.817
Just start dishing it.

44:16.153 --> 44:17.196
Thank you.

44:17.279 --> 44:18.947
Shit.

44:17.279 --> 44:18.947
Sorry.

44:24.244 --> 44:26.246
Jesus Christ,
give me some air.

44:29.917 --> 44:31.960
Yep. (laughing)

44:33.754 --> 44:35.047
Oh god.

44:35.130 --> 44:37.007
(all laughing)

44:37.091 --> 44:38.258
Evening.

44:38.342 --> 44:39.551
Hello, sir.

44:39.635 --> 44:41.095
Did something
die in here?

44:41.178 --> 44:42.971
Yeah,
Malarkey's ass.

44:44.181 --> 44:46.892
Uh, any word on
Lieutenant Meehan yet, sir?

44:46.975 --> 44:48.560
No, not yet.

44:51.814 --> 44:54.066
Don't that make you our
commanding officer, sir?

44:55.150 --> 44:57.736
Yeah, it does.

44:59.822 --> 45:00.739
Sir?

45:00.823 --> 45:02.616
Joe, the lieutenant
don't drink.

45:06.286 --> 45:08.288
It's been
a day of firsts.

45:14.711 --> 45:16.380
Don't you think,
Guarnere?

45:19.550 --> 45:20.926
Yes, sir.

45:23.804 --> 45:25.097
Carry on.

45:25.180 --> 45:27.141
Goodnight, sir.

45:27.224 --> 45:28.559
Oh, Sergeant?

45:28.642 --> 45:29.893
Sir?

45:29.977 --> 45:32.146
I'm not a Quaker.

45:36.233 --> 45:38.444
If he's from Lancaster County,
he's probably a Mennonite.

45:38.527 --> 45:39.862
What's a Mennonite?

45:39.945 --> 45:42.030
(chattering)

45:43.866 --> 45:45.159
Hey!

45:46.368 --> 45:47.744
Hey Dick,
wait up!

45:47.828 --> 45:48.704
What?

45:48.787 --> 45:49.997
You know that
map you found?

45:50.080 --> 45:51.957
It had every Kraut gun
in Normandy on it.

45:52.040 --> 45:53.000
Oh, yeah?

45:53.083 --> 45:54.168
Yeah.

45:55.836 --> 45:57.546
Here.

45:59.381 --> 46:01.049
Don't ever get a cat.

46:02.384 --> 46:03.886
What's on your mind?

46:03.969 --> 46:06.597
I lost a man today.

46:06.680 --> 46:07.848
Oh.

46:07.931 --> 46:09.349
Hall.

46:09.433 --> 46:12.686
Thanks. A John Hall,
New Yorker.

46:12.769 --> 46:15.439
Got killed today
at Brecourt.

46:15.522 --> 46:17.149
I never knew him.

46:17.232 --> 46:18.317
Yeah, you did.

46:18.400 --> 46:22.863
Radio-op,
506th basketball team,
Able Company.

46:24.656 --> 46:27.367
He was a good man.

46:27.451 --> 46:28.702
Man...

46:28.785 --> 46:31.997
not even old enough
to buy a beer.

46:36.126 --> 46:37.961
Not hungry.

46:39.755 --> 46:41.006
Hey, Dick.

46:42.966 --> 46:45.260
I sent that map up
to Division.

46:45.344 --> 46:47.721
I think it's gonna
do some good.

47:30.347 --> 47:33.016
Winters:
<i>That night I took time</i>
<i>to thank God</i>

47:33.100 --> 47:35.352
<i>for seeing me through</i>
<i>that day of days,</i>

47:35.435 --> 47:38.897
<i>and prayed I would make it</i>
<i>through D Plus One.</i>

47:38.981 --> 47:43.819
<i>And if, somehow,</i>
<i>I managed to get home again,</i>

47:43.902 --> 47:47.155
<i>I promised God,</i>
<i>and myself,</i>

47:47.239 --> 47:50.409
<i>that I would find</i>
<i>a quiet piece of land</i>
<i>someplace</i>

47:50.492 --> 47:54.329
<i>and spend the rest</i>
<i>of my life in peace.</i>
