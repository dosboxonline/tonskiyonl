The killer got away
in a cream-coloured Ford truck,

20:09.918 --> 20:12.045
- and I think it might be out here.
- Plates?

20:12.212 --> 20:15.465
Plates were phony. We got some
evidence that points to Wonder World.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.634
So what I want to do is go down
to Wonder World and look around

20:17.801 --> 20:20.596

Maybe I can find something out.

20:20.762 --> 20:22.055

security force in America.

20:27.686 --> 20:29.313

20:32.691 --> 20:35.652
You go on out. I'll call DeWald,
tell him you're coming.

20:35.819 --> 20:38.697
He's a great guy. He's a pal of mine.
I'll meet you out there.

20:38.864 --> 20:40.324
Great. Thanks.

20:40.490 --> 20:43.493
You'll love Wonder World.
It's a great place.

20:43.660 --> 20:47.789
Axel, don't forget,
we play by the rules around here.

20:48.457 --> 20:50.292
I've heard Taggart's stories.

20:55.130 --> 20:58.133
Which one of those green lines
is Wonder World behind?

21:17.778 --> 21:20.197
- There he is!
- OK, come on!

21:23.784 --> 21:26.119
Hello, sir, welcome to Wonder World.
Can I help you?

21:26.286 --> 21:30.248
Yes, I'd like to talk to one of the park
executives, a Mr. Ellis DeWald.

21:30.415 --> 21:31.708
Do you have an appointment?

21:31.875 --> 21:35.045
- I'm supposed to. My name's Axel Foley.
- OK.

21:35.212 --> 21:37.089
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have you on the list.

21:37.839 --> 21:39.216
Maybe they haven't called yet.

21:39.383 --> 21:41.635
A Detective Flint from
the Beverly Hills Police Department

21:41.802 --> 21:43.762
was supposed to call
and get me squared away.

21:43.929 --> 21:46.390
I'm sorry, sir, but if you don't have an
appointment for park business,

21:46.556 --> 21:47.891
you will have to buy a ticket.

21:49.476 --> 21:52.145
- How much is a ticket?
- Thirty-five dollars.

21:52.312 --> 21:53.563
Thirty-five dollars?!

21:53.730 --> 21:57.150
That allows you and your party access
to all the rides, shows and attractions.

21:57.317 --> 22:00.153
Wait a minute. Look,
I don't want to go on any rides,

22:00.320 --> 22:01.738
and I don't have any party.
It's just me.

22:01.905 --> 22:04.282
All I wanna do
is talk to the director of security.

22:05.033 --> 22:07.744
Excuse me, sir, would you step
out of line for a moment, please?

22:07.911 --> 22:11.873
- What line?
- Just step over here, please, sir.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.917
Thank you.

22:16.003 --> 22:17.004
Is there a problem, sir?

22:17.170 --> 22:18.672
Yeah, I'll tell you
what the problem is.

22:18.839 --> 22:20.465
Thirty-five dollars,
that's what the problem is.

22:20.632 --> 22:21.758
If the admission seems high,

22:21.925 --> 22:24.386
we suggest you go
down the road to Fantasy Park.

22:24.553 --> 22:27.347
You might find their ticket price
more to your liking, sir.

22:27.514 --> 22:30.684
The point is, I'm here to see
Ellis DeWald. Is he your boss?

22:30.851 --> 22:33.812
Yes. Mr. DeWald
is head of security and guest relations.

22:33.979 --> 22:37.024
- Do you have an appointment?
- I'm supposed to have an appointment.

22:37.190 --> 22:40.569

22:45.157 --> 22:47.117

- One, please.
- There you go. Thank you.

22:57.461 --> 22:58.754
Thank you.

23:00.964 --> 23:02.549
You know, you should have your tailor

23:02.716 --> 23:04.259
cut the jacket a little wider
in the chest.

23:04.426 --> 23:06.303

won't bulge in the back.

doing one of his usual inspections.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.840
You say this guy designed
the whole park?

39:43.007 --> 39:44.300
Yes.

39:46.802 --> 39:49.597
- And he knew the place cold, right?
- Of course.

39:51.057 --> 39:52.850
So what are you thinking?

39:53.017 --> 39:54.894
I'm thinking that he
must've found something

39:55.061 --> 39:56.687
that someone
didn't want him to find.

39:56.854 --> 40:00.316
At Wonder World?
What on earth could that be?

40:00.483 --> 40:03.819
It's a place
of childhood innocence and fun.

40:03.986 --> 40:05.863
And life and death.

40:10.493 --> 40:13.329
- You met Uncle Dave?
- Yep.

40:13.496 --> 40:16.791
Uncle Dave. [laughs]

40:16.957 --> 40:19.835
I don't believe it. I'd give
anything to have been with you.

40:20.002 --> 40:23.881
- Did he do the Oki-Doki Shuffle?
- No.

40:30.513 --> 40:32.890
- [alarm beeps]
- Whoa!

40:33.682 --> 40:34.809
Outstanding.

40:37.019 --> 40:41.899
- Hi. William Rosewood, DDO-JSIOC.
- I beg your pardon?

40:44.151 --> 40:47.238
This is me. Thank you.

40:50.699 --> 40:52.993
Now, what you gonna do with this shit?

40:55.246 --> 41:00.334
No way.
I don't believe this! Ackwell!

41:01.168 --> 41:05.214
Ackwell Folee!
Ackwell Folee, you crazy thing.

41:05.381 --> 41:06.799
What you doing here?

41:09.051 --> 41:11.470
- "Serge."
- [French pronunciation] Serge.

41:11.637 --> 41:13.347
- Serge. Serge.
- Serge.

41:13.514 --> 41:15.933
Look at your head!
I love it short!

41:16.100 --> 41:19.228
- Yeah, Serge.
- Turn around. Turn around.

41:20.104 --> 41:21.772
I don't believe how perfect you look!

41:21.939 --> 41:24.358
And then finally you have black
Hush Poopies,

41:24.525 --> 41:28.237
which are totally retro, which I love.
You put a really good package together.

41:29.280 --> 41:33.617
- You remember Billy Rosewood.
- Billy! Billy, I remember you.

41:33.784 --> 41:35.744
- Do you remember?
- Of course.

41:35.911 --> 41:39.748
I made you an espresso at
the art gallery with a lemon twist?

41:41.167 --> 41:42.960
It was the last one I ever made.

41:43.127 --> 41:45.546
It's terrible to drink espresso.
You know why?

41:46.505 --> 41:49.008
It stain your teeth.
I'm not going to show you mine,

41:49.175 --> 41:50.259
but let me see your teeth.

41:51.927 --> 41:54.388
They're so pretty.
Can I see your teeth?

41:55.598 --> 41:57.516
Look, and you got healthy gums.

41:57.683 --> 41:59.435
- Do you do colonics?
- Excuse me?

41:59.602 --> 42:01.312
- Do you do colonics?
- No. Never...

42:01.478 --> 42:03.814
- It's my new favourite thing!
- You dig colonics?

42:03.981 --> 42:08.027
I can't tell you what it's like, because
they stick a hose up inside you...

42:08.194 --> 42:10.404
- I know...
- No, you've got to understand.

42:10.571 --> 42:14.533
Out comes a candy bar
from when you were five!

42:16.160 --> 42:17.953
What happened to your
art gallery that you had?

42:18.120 --> 42:20.873
The art gallery is completely bankrupt.

42:21.040 --> 42:22.958
In the toilet. Why?

42:23.125 --> 42:26.962
Because we had an owner who was
obstinate and stupid and ignorant.

42:27.129 --> 42:29.840
- You shot him, remember?
- Oh, right, yes. I shot him.

42:30.007 --> 42:32.635
- What are you doing now?
- I'm doing guns. Come and look!

42:37.097 --> 42:39.767
This is my booth.
The Survival Boutique.

42:39.934 --> 42:45.648
We are doing weapons and protective
devices and products for survival

42:45.814 --> 42:48.150
in the helter-skelter world of today.

42:48.317 --> 42:50.444
OK, now, one thing's very important.

42:50.611 --> 42:54.490
At the Survival Boutique,
I feel that it's my personality,

42:54.657 --> 42:58.285
my philosophy that everything
must conform to the three P's, OK,

42:58.452 --> 43:01.830
which is protection,
prestige and pretty.

43:03.791 --> 43:06.460
I mean, why you should look ugly
if you're just trying to survive?

43:06.627 --> 43:09.588
You should be able to maintain
your personal sense of style

43:09.755 --> 43:11.006
and be safe as well.

43:11.173 --> 43:12.675
OK, what do you think this is?

43:13.926 --> 43:16.720
Is look like a key chain,
but it's so much more.

43:16.887 --> 43:20.307
This is called a Stunner.
It is designed by an ex-Navy SEAL.

43:20.474 --> 43:23.852
OK? Very serious individual,
I never see him smile.

43:24.019 --> 43:26.855
Also, I never see him
in a pair of pants that fit.

43:29.441 --> 43:32.736
Someone comes up to you
who is a carjacker.

43:32.903 --> 43:35.948
Do you want to die for your Camry?
I don't think so, right?

43:36.115 --> 43:39.034
So you say...
a little bit of deception...

43:39.201 --> 43:41.996
"I want to separate
the house from my car keys, OK?

43:42.162 --> 43:46.166
I'm just going to push this button,
OK?" And he says, "OK."

43:46.333 --> 43:49.795
And then you push this button,
and out it comes from the mechanism,

43:49.962 --> 43:53.882
the brightest, blinding light
ever that you seeing.

43:54.049 --> 43:56.552
He cannot see. He's like this.

43:56.719 --> 43:58.679
Everyone is come running
to help you.

43:58.846 --> 44:02.057
And once again,
you have survived with style.

44:02.224 --> 44:04.310
Wow. That's cool.

44:04.476 --> 44:08.522
Billy, I want to give you one
for a present, OK?

44:08.689 --> 44:11.400
- Thank you.
- And Ackwell...

44:11.567 --> 44:14.111
I want to give you one
because I worry about you.

44:14.278 --> 44:18.157
- I want you to be safe.
- Thanks.

44:18.324 --> 44:19.491
Now I'm going to show you something

44:19.658 --> 44:22.244
that is going to totally
blow your rocks off.

44:22.411 --> 44:26.707
It's absolutely orgasmic
and my most thing that I'm proud of.

44:26.874 --> 44:31.795
It's the most up-to-date,
the ultimate survival tool for today.

44:32.671 --> 44:33.881

<i>Stopping power is a matter of

45:22.262 --> 45:24.306
That's Dodi, my personal trainer.

45:25.849 --> 45:28.060
She can bench-press 200 pounds.

45:29.144 --> 45:32.147
She's working on reducing
my body fat, but it's really difficult,

45:32.314 --> 45:35.442
because I keep sneaking away
to have a goat cheese.

45:35.609 --> 45:37.569
I don't care. I wear suits.

45:37.736 --> 45:41.448

46:00.384 --> 46:02.052
Are you joking?

46:02.219 --> 46:04.972
This is LA. I'm selling hundreds
of these. It's on back order.

46:05.139 --> 46:07.641
- Get the fuck outta here!
- No, I cannot!

46:07.808 --> 46:09.893
I am trying to tell you,
I sell ten of these

46:10.060 --> 46:11.979
to Jackie Stallone
for stocking stuffers.

46:12.146 --> 46:15.315
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Sly come in and bought 14.

46:15.482 --> 46:17.651
- Zsa Zsa Gabor has one...
- [applause]

46:17.818 --> 46:20.446
- We gotta go, Serge.
- Thanks.

46:20.612 --> 46:23.365
Ackwell, try to say Serge.
It's not so difficult.

46:23.532 --> 46:26.493
"Serge" sounds like a detergent.

46:37.880 --> 46:39.465
What are you gonna do, Axel?

46:39.631 --> 46:42.593
I'm not gonna do nothing.
I just wanna hear the man speak.

46:43.719 --> 46:45.888
To keep a park like Wonder World

46:46.054 --> 46:51.185
a safe, wholesome, family environment

46:51.351 --> 46:56.857
in difficult times like these
is an enormous challenge.

46:58.400 --> 47:02.404
But my friend Ellis DeWald
has done just that.

47:06.742 --> 47:11.205
Couple that with Ellis' work
with underprivileged kids,

47:11.371 --> 47:15.918
some of whom are seated at the
head table right now with Ellis...

47:16.084 --> 47:17.628
[applause]

47:29.598 --> 47:33.185
...and you can understand
why he's our award winner.

47:33.352 --> 47:34.561
So let's bring him up here.

47:34.728 --> 47:37.814
Ladies and gentlemen,
the head of security at Wonder World

47:37.981 --> 47:40.943
and Private Law Enforcement's
Man of the Year award winner,

47:41.109 --> 47:43.570
my dear friend, Ellis DeWald.

47:43.737 --> 47:47.115
[cheering and applause]

47:57.042 --> 47:59.795
- Congratulations. You deserve it.
- Thank you, Orrin.

48:01.213 --> 48:03.340
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Mike.

48:05.801 --> 48:07.344
Oh!

48:08.178 --> 48:10.389
Huh? Huh?

48:19.398 --> 48:22.150
You're not gonna do nothing, Axel.
You never do nothing.

48:22.317 --> 48:24.278
[Ellis] Thank you very much.

48:24.444 --> 48:26.989
You know, a lot of nice things happen

48:27.155 --> 48:30.492
when you work at a nice place
like Wonder World,

48:30.659 --> 48:34.329
especially when your bosses
are people like Orrin Sanderson

48:34.496 --> 48:36.540
and Uncle Dave Thornton.

48:36.707 --> 48:40.085
And I don't think
that Uncle Dave would mind

48:40.252 --> 48:45.841
if I said that this is
the nicest thing yet.

48:46.008 --> 48:47.884
Thank you very much.

48:51.930 --> 48:55.392
Please don't do this, Axel.
Please don't do it. Don't do it.

48:55.559 --> 48:57.728
- Bravo!
- Don't do it. Don't do it.

48:57.894 --> 49:01.690
Bravo, Ellis DeWald! Ellis DeWald!

49:02.649 --> 49:04.693
Bravo!

49:05.444 --> 49:08.030
Bravo! Bravo, Ellis!

49:08.196 --> 49:10.407
Ellis DeWald, ladies and gentlemen!

49:11.700 --> 49:14.036
Ellis DeWald! Y'all keep it going!

49:14.202 --> 49:16.038
Keep it going for Ellis DeWald!
Come on, it's Ellis!

49:16.204 --> 49:17.706
Ellis DeWald, y'all!

49:19.458 --> 49:21.877
You're not clapping loud enough!
This is Ellis DeWald!

49:22.044 --> 49:23.462
It's this man's night! Yes!

49:26.298 --> 49:29.843
Ladies and gentlemen, I travelled
all the way from Detroit, Michigan

49:30.010 --> 49:32.804
to be with this man tonight,
to honour this man tonight.

49:33.597 --> 49:36.183
My name is Axel Foley.
I'm a Detroit police officer.

49:36.350 --> 49:39.019
It is a tremendous surprise
for Mr. DeWald

49:39.186 --> 49:40.937
to have me standing
right next to him right now.

49:41.104 --> 49:43.357
I can feel his body tingling!

49:43.523 --> 49:45.817
But, ladies and gentlemen,
I want you to know,

49:45.984 --> 49:47.861
there's not a night that goes by

49:48.028 --> 49:51.782
that I don't think about
what I owe Ellis DeWald.

49:51.948 --> 49:55.243
There's not a night that passes
that I don't think about

49:55.410 --> 49:59.790
what the people of Detroit
owe Ellis DeWald!

49:59.956 --> 50:04.378
And I'd just like to say, when I
see y'all give him this award for...

50:04.544 --> 50:06.296
What's this here?
Ah, that's beautiful.

50:06.463 --> 50:08.632
"With gratitude
for community service."

50:09.716 --> 50:12.135
And I'm going to do
the community a service

50:12.302 --> 50:15.639
because I'm going
to pay back Ellis DeWald

50:15.806 --> 50:18.767
everything we owe him with interest!

50:18.934 --> 50:19.935
[audience cheering]

50:20.769 --> 50:24.106
Ellis DeWald!
Ellis DeWald!

50:27.526 --> 50:30.362
Go on, smile, Ellis.
Get them last few smiles in.

50:31.238 --> 50:33.365
What's the matter, Foley?

50:33.532 --> 50:36.159
You mad at me
for shooting your boyfriend?

50:44.501 --> 50:46.086
[Billy yells]

50:46.795 --> 50:49.715
I got him! I got him! I got him!
I got him!

50:51.341 --> 50:53.176
[screaming]

50:54.636 --> 50:58.682
You and Billy
disturbing the peace? No! [laughing]

50:58.849 --> 51:00.809
Do me a favour.
Just make your fucking phone call

51:00.976 --> 51:01.977
and get us out of here, all right?

51:02.144 --> 51:06.148
Sure. Let's see, now who
do I know down there? Let's see.

51:06.314 --> 51:08.275
Hey, don't fuck with me right now.

51:08.442 --> 51:11.319
All right, keep your shirt on.
I'll get you guys out.

51:11.486 --> 51:14.156
Oh, incidentally, I think we found
that truck you were looking for.

51:15.449 --> 51:18.243
- Where?
- By the Santa Monica Pier at the beach.

51:18.410 --> 51:20.495
I'm headed there now and
I'll pick you guys up on the way.

51:20.662 --> 51:23.665
And Axel, in the meantime,
don't take any showers.

51:23.832 --> 51:25.834
[cackling]

51:34.885 --> 51:37.721
I'm all washed-up. Dead in the water.

51:37.888 --> 51:41.183
Will you stop worrying? I talked to
Flint, he's gonna get us out of here.

51:41.349 --> 51:43.935
I really liked that office.

51:44.102 --> 51:48.273
- Foley! You're out of here.
- That was quick.

51:50.025 --> 51:51.902
Not him, just you.

51:57.574 --> 51:59.326
[Fulbright] Come in.

52:11.838 --> 52:13.757
Thank you, officer.

52:17.219 --> 52:19.262
I ran a check on you, Foley.

52:21.681 --> 52:25.393
You're a hell of a detective,
but something of a maverick.

52:28.688 --> 52:31.650
I know what you're doing.
I know the drill.

52:32.984 --> 52:36.112
You hassle DeWald,
you get him to panic,

52:36.279 --> 52:37.614
make a rash move...

52:38.615 --> 52:43.161
But God damn it, Foley,
we do not want to panic this man.

52:43.328 --> 52:47.249
We want him doing business
as fucking usual.

52:48.041 --> 52:49.876
Do you copy me, Foley?

52:56.550 --> 53:01.304
Ticket to Detroit, first class,
courtesy of the federal government.

53:01.471 --> 53:03.849
Also, my card.

53:04.015 --> 53:08.937
Should you have any more thoughts
about DeWald, let us handle it.

53:09.688 --> 53:10.730
Hmm?

53:16.528 --> 53:19.698
I give you my word as a gentleman
I'll be on that plane.

53:28.623 --> 53:31.960
Truck was spotted by an LAPD
traffic control officer in Santa Monica.

53:32.127 --> 53:34.754
It's a different colour,
but the same make and model as yours.

53:35.547 --> 53:39.593
Read you. Out. Beach leader, over?

53:39.759 --> 53:42.345
Negatory, SWAT,
hold for our arrival.

53:42.512 --> 53:45.807
ETA...11 minutes. Out.

53:47.684 --> 53:49.686
Billy, who were you just talking to?

53:49.853 --> 53:52.272
Truck was discovered inside
the county green line,

53:52.439 --> 53:55.191
so I co-ordinated
with the SMPD, BHPD,

53:55.358 --> 53:59.571
LAPD, sheriff of Los Angeles County,
Supervisor of Parks and Recreation,

53:59.738 --> 54:02.157
California State Highway Patrol,
district attorney's office

54:02.324 --> 54:04.159
and United States Naval Shore Patrol.

54:16.296 --> 54:18.882
Beach leader to team one. Proceed.

54:19.049 --> 54:20.842
[sirens wailing]

54:35.273 --> 54:37.108
[men shouting]

54:44.699 --> 54:46.618
All teams standing ready.

54:48.536 --> 54:50.372
Go! Go! Go!

54:59.714 --> 55:01.257
Area secured.

55:10.725 --> 55:14.646
Lab says these are the same
fibres as the truck upholstery.

55:14.813 --> 55:16.398
No help there.

55:16.564 --> 55:19.275
There's some beach sand,
probably blew in after it was abandoned.

55:24.072 --> 55:26.908
I just had a very unpleasant
conversation with my superiors.

55:27.075 --> 55:29.619
- What, about being busted?
- No.

55:29.786 --> 55:34.374
There was some objection to my use
of manpower in Operation: Truck Siege.

55:39.587 --> 55:42.132
- What is it?
- You got a 50-dollar bill?

55:42.298 --> 55:45.552
I've got a wife and three kids.
I haven't seen a 50 in 12 years.

55:46.261 --> 55:49.014
- Billy, you got a 50-dollar bill?
- When do I get it back?

55:49.180 --> 55:51.016
Man, give me 50 dollars!

55:56.187 --> 55:57.939
It's all I got.

56:05.155 --> 56:08.867
This is corner of a 50-dollar bill, like
Billy's new one with the hidden barcode.

56:09.743 --> 56:12.162
So the corner tore off a bill.
Happens all the time.

56:12.328 --> 56:14.289
No, the barcode's going up and down,

56:14.456 --> 56:16.291
which means it comes off
this corner of the bill.

56:16.458 --> 56:19.044
If it comes off this corner
it should have some ink on it.

56:19.210 --> 56:21.671
This doesn't.
This is too big to be blank.

56:22.505 --> 56:24.674
[calliope music playing]

56:46.071 --> 56:47.822
[joyous screaming]

56:50.283 --> 56:53.578
Look! It's Oki-Doki!

56:56.039 --> 56:58.041
[train whistle blows]

56:58.208 --> 57:00.293
Go after your brother.
And don't let him get away.

57:00.460 --> 57:02.337
I got to load my camera.

57:02.504 --> 57:04.380
[boy] Oki-Doki!

57:04.547 --> 57:08.301
[Axel] Hey, nice little kid.
How you doing? Good to see you.

57:08.468 --> 57:11.930
I love you, Oki-Doki!

57:12.097 --> 57:14.808
Hey, Oki, do the Oki Shuffle.

57:15.558 --> 57:19.187
[Axel] Oki-Doki, Oki-Doki,
Doki, Doki, Oki...

57:19.354 --> 57:21.940
That's not right! It's like this.

57:23.983 --> 57:26.528
Hey, listen, kid.
I'm Oki-Doki and I changed the steps.

57:26.694 --> 57:27.695
You got a problem with that?

57:29.114 --> 57:31.991
You're supposed to be nice to me
no matter what I do!

57:32.158 --> 57:33.201
[Axel grunts]

57:33.368 --> 57:35.495
[muttering] You little motherfucker,
I'll kick your ass.

57:36.955 --> 57:38.373
Yeah?

57:44.254 --> 57:47.882
Grandma! Grandma!
Oki-Doki pushed me!

57:54.556 --> 57:56.224
You take it already.

57:57.225 --> 57:59.394
Come on, Sheldon.
You playing or what?

57:59.561 --> 58:01.729
Who the hell ate garlic?

58:01.896 --> 58:04.858
Yeah, when's lunch?
I want a pastrami sandwich on rye.

58:05.024 --> 58:07.527
You guys see
that new Rufus Rabbit?

58:09.821 --> 58:11.364
- Axel?
- [man] What?

58:11.531 --> 58:15.034
Coffee. Would you like some coffee?

58:15.952 --> 58:17.495
Hey, Louis, how's it going?

58:17.662 --> 58:20.039
- [Axel] Fine, fine.
- Say hi to Irene for me.

58:20.206 --> 58:22.917
- Will do.
- Louis?

58:25.253 --> 58:26.921
Follow me.

58:27.088 --> 58:29.841
[man] I wouldn't mind
giving her a little massage.

58:30.675 --> 58:33.970
When DeWald took over
he stuck me down here

58:34.137 --> 58:36.097
on what he calls park safety watch.

58:36.890 --> 58:40.393
He thinks he took me out of the loop,
but as long as I have a computer,

58:40.560 --> 58:45.481
I can still access
most of what's in the mainframe.

58:45.648 --> 58:48.610
- OK, is this the tunnel system?
- Yes.

58:48.776 --> 58:52.572
Do any of these tunnels lead to
a place where it's like limited access

58:52.739 --> 58:54.282
and only DeWald's boys can go there?

58:54.449 --> 58:58.369
No. All park accesses are
unrestricted to park personnel.

58:59.329 --> 59:02.624
Well, except for the Happy Forest.
That's closed while being redone.

59:02.790 --> 59:04.125
Show me the Happy Forest.

59:04.292 --> 59:08.922
Oh, that would be right here
at the end of Corridor B.

59:09.088 --> 59:10.798
It's right after, uh...

59:12.926 --> 59:14.844
It's right after, um...

59:16.054 --> 59:19.557
- How long's it been closed?
- Too long.

59:22.560 --> 59:24.687
I'm talking about
the Happy Forest ride?

59:25.980 --> 59:28.024
Oh! [giggles]

59:28.191 --> 59:32.570
The Forest.
Yes, about a couple of weeks.

59:32.737 --> 59:33.905
It wasn't a very popular ride,

59:34.072 --> 59:35.782
so they're trying to come up
with some new ideas.

59:35.949 --> 59:37.200
I think they found a new idea.

59:37.367 --> 59:40.370
Can I have this piece of thing here?
Can you rip that off for me?

59:40.536 --> 59:42.747
- Sure.
- Thanks.

59:46.960 --> 59:48.920
There you go.

59:49.087 --> 59:53.049
You know, uh...
when this thing is over...

59:53.216 --> 59:54.467
Uh-huh?

59:59.097 --> 01:00:02.684
Would you like to get together
and have some dinner or something?

01:00:04.018 --> 01:00:06.479
- That would be nice.
- Can you put that in here?

01:00:06.646 --> 01:00:09.607
Sure. There you go.

01:00:09.774 --> 01:00:11.484
- We have a date.
- A date.

01:00:11.651 --> 01:00:13.027
All right.
Can you help me with this thing?

01:00:13.194 --> 01:00:15.655
- Sure.
- [both grunt]

01:00:16.489 --> 01:00:17.991
There you go.

01:00:19.367 --> 01:00:23.204
- Remember, an elephant never forgets.
- All right.

01:00:32.547 --> 01:00:35.008
- [Axel] Hey, Louis, how goes it?
- Fine. Nice to see you.

01:00:35.174 --> 01:00:37.635
- Say hello to Irene.
- You bet. See you around.

Everything on schedule?

01:02:21.197 --> 01:02:22.949
Yeah, I had to tweak
the image a little bit.

01:02:23.116 --> 01:02:25.785

But it's under control now.

that I stayed.

01:07:40.975 --> 01:07:43.018

That's what was in that hijacked truck
back in Detroit.

01:07:47.231 --> 01:07:48.983
You wanted to follow the truck
back to LA

01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:51.485
so you could track DeWald, find out
where his fucking print shop is.

01:07:51.652 --> 01:07:53.404
Well, it's here in Wonder World.

01:07:53.571 --> 01:07:55.573

raving about?

- He's insane! He's proved that.
- In Wonder World?

01:07:59.076 --> 01:08:02.830
This place is as high-tech
as NASA and Nintendo combined.

01:08:02.997 --> 01:08:05.207
They got a hidden room
under this closed ride.

01:08:05.374 --> 01:08:07.293
And they do all this shit in there,
and I was in there,

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.170
and that's why they were chasing me.

01:08:09.336 --> 01:08:10.880
My men were pursuing Mr. Foley

01:08:11.046 --> 01:08:14.759
because he's obviously delusionary
and potentially dangerous.

01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:16.844
This hidden room, delusionary also?

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:21.432
No. There is a closed ride,
which we use to...

01:08:21.599 --> 01:08:26.228
- I'd better take a look at it.
- Yes, maybe we'd better look at it.

01:08:33.903 --> 01:08:37.031
Right here. Counterfeit bills,
right out of this machine.

01:08:38.032 --> 01:08:41.202

and as soon as we leave,

01:09:31.252 --> 01:09:34.087
- they'll put it back.
- What's this paper?

01:09:36.631 --> 01:09:39.051
- Ordinary rag.
- Then they switched it.

01:09:39.218 --> 01:09:41.970
I am tired of these accusations.

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:45.599

arrested for public endangerment.

01:10:07.288 --> 01:10:08.789
if you weren't a cop,

01:10:08.956 --> 01:10:11.542
I'd have you doing dead time
in Leavenworth for life.

01:10:13.043 --> 01:10:15.588
Detective Flint, he's yours.

01:10:18.924 --> 01:10:20.175
Let's go, Axel.

01:10:27.683 --> 01:10:29.643
Make sure he doesn't
get on the plane.

01:10:30.227 --> 01:10:32.646
God damn it, Axel, I got a wife,
three kids, a mortgage

01:10:32.813 --> 01:10:34.481
and a pension that won't cut it.

01:10:34.648 --> 01:10:36.650
I need that job at Wonder World.

01:10:36.817 --> 01:10:38.027
It's my retirement plan, Axel.

01:10:40.988 --> 01:10:42.323
We're being followed.

01:10:44.909 --> 01:10:47.286
Looks like the security guards
at Wonder World.

01:10:47.453 --> 01:10:49.663
They probably want to make sure
you get on that plane.

01:10:52.124 --> 01:10:53.834
Because of you,
my future is now in jeopardy.

01:10:54.001 --> 01:10:56.003
I mean, real fucking jeopardy.

01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:59.673

doesn't think too highly of me.

Take it easy.

01:11:17.024 --> 01:11:20.402
I'll get him. I'll get him.
When I do, I'll kill him!

01:11:29.954 --> 01:11:33.374
Axel, I left as soon
as I got your call. Are you all right?

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:36.877
I'm fine, but Dave, listen,
I want you to think back real hard

01:11:37.044 --> 01:11:38.712
to the night that Fry first disappeared.

01:11:38.879 --> 01:11:40.714
Maybe you forgot to tell me something.

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.592
No. Why would you think that?

01:11:43.759 --> 01:11:46.220
Because this note by itself...

01:11:48.013 --> 01:11:49.390
It just don't make no sense.

01:11:49.556 --> 01:11:51.892
"This is important.
Life and death. Roger."

01:11:52.059 --> 01:11:53.102
Why would even he send that?

01:11:54.645 --> 01:11:56.563
It don't say "Help."
He don't say, "I need to talk to you."

01:11:56.730 --> 01:11:58.691
Nothing. It's just this.

01:12:16.667 --> 01:12:18.502
Oh, shit.

01:12:19.712 --> 01:12:21.630
Fry must have found
some sample paper.

01:12:21.797 --> 01:12:23.841
He knew they'd kill him
so he sent you it.

01:12:24.008 --> 01:12:26.635
- Look, there's a barcode on it.
- What does that mean?

01:12:26.802 --> 01:12:29.221
That means that this paper
used to belong to Uncle Sam.

01:12:29.388 --> 01:12:30.389
Now we got some evidence.

01:12:30.556 --> 01:12:33.183
We can put Sanderson and DeWald's ass
in jail. That's what it means.

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:34.810
I don't think so.

01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:40.274
I figured you'd call Uncle Dave
here, so we followed him.

01:12:42.776 --> 01:12:44.987
I actually was a real cop once,

01:12:45.154 --> 01:12:47.740
so I know how you assholes think,

01:12:47.906 --> 01:12:50.784

01:12:52.119 --> 01:12:53.620

around the evidence

huh, Sherlock?

01:13:02.254 --> 01:13:05.549
Well, here's how the real ending
of the story goes.

Let's see if you like it.

01:13:07.926 --> 01:13:09.928
We, at Wonder World,
heard you were on the loose.

01:13:10.095 --> 01:13:11.638
You had a grudge against the park.

01:13:12.765 --> 01:13:16.810
I feared you might try
to harm our beloved Uncle Dave,

01:13:16.977 --> 01:13:21.732

as I could to try and stop you,

01:13:21.899 --> 01:13:26.320

01:27:47.931 --> 01:27:49.766
[all yelling]

01:27:57.565 --> 01:28:00.526
- Tell him I need that right away!
- [pager beeping]

01:28:00.693 --> 01:28:03.363
Damn it. Not again. Excuse me.

01:28:07.033 --> 01:28:08.701
Dispatch, this is Flint.

01:28:08.868 --> 01:28:12.372
Trace that number
that keeps calling me. 555-4085.

01:28:12.538 --> 01:28:13.706
<i>[man] Trace just came in.</i>

01:28:13.873 --> 01:28:16.084
<i>It's a computer line
at the Wonder World theme park.</i>

01:28:16.876 --> 01:28:19.712
Wonder World? Call 'em back.
Tell them their computer's on the blink.

01:28:19.879 --> 01:28:22.632
<i>We tried that, but all the voice
lines at Wonder World seem to be down.</i>

01:28:22.799 --> 01:28:25.218
Must have something to do
with that Uncle Dave shooting.

01:28:26.552 --> 01:28:30.682
- Jesus! Somebody shot Uncle Dave?
- Some fool named Axel Foley.

01:28:39.065 --> 01:28:41.693
Hey, hey...
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:28:59.794 --> 01:29:01.421
Where the fuck is he?

01:29:53.681 --> 01:29:55.308
- [roars]
- [yelps]

01:30:06.027 --> 01:30:08.196
[trumpeting]

01:30:22.835 --> 01:30:24.712
[roars]

01:30:38.768 --> 01:30:41.270
[bird chirping]

01:30:53.449 --> 01:30:56.536
Get to a phone and call the police.
I'll try and find Axel.

01:30:56.702 --> 01:30:57.912
All right!

01:31:13.052 --> 01:31:16.389
- Oh!
- [door opens]

01:31:16.556 --> 01:31:18.933
- There you are. Foley's...
- [gunshots]

01:31:21.435 --> 01:31:23.437
[roaring]

01:31:47.128 --> 01:31:49.130
[theme park music playing]

01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:06.147
Name's Wild Bill Rosewood.
I'm the sheriff of this town.

01:32:11.527 --> 01:32:13.988
[grunting]

01:32:26.876 --> 01:32:29.295
What the hell happened here?

01:32:40.223 --> 01:32:41.307
Shit!

01:32:43.893 --> 01:32:44.977
Damn it!

01:32:49.398 --> 01:32:51.359
[screaming]

01:32:51.525 --> 01:32:53.027
[body thuds]

01:32:53.194 --> 01:32:55.154
[theme park music continues playing]

01:32:57.990 --> 01:33:00.368
Turn that fucking song off!

01:33:00.534 --> 01:33:03.996
[roaring]

01:33:23.516 --> 01:33:24.684
[yells]

01:34:24.493 --> 01:34:27.246
Foley? You all right?

01:34:28.164 --> 01:34:32.418
- Hello, Fulbright.
- You hurt bad?

01:34:35.755 --> 01:34:39.258
Look, Foley, I guess
I owe you an apology.

01:34:40.009 --> 01:34:41.177
You were right.

01:34:41.344 --> 01:34:45.014
I got Sanderson handcuffed
in the car. He was in on it, right?

01:34:46.432 --> 01:34:49.518
I found out about another partner
that was in on it.

01:34:52.438 --> 01:34:53.731
So long, Foley.

01:34:55.358 --> 01:34:56.359
Axel!

01:34:57.151 --> 01:34:58.402
- [gun fires]
- [grunts]

01:35:14.126 --> 01:35:15.336
You OK?

01:35:17.797 --> 01:35:20.299
Any chance you can explain
any of this to me?

01:35:22.593 --> 01:35:24.512
Like why the fuck am I shot?

01:35:31.185 --> 01:35:33.270
You guys OK?

01:35:37.608 --> 01:35:41.320
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

01:35:45.658 --> 01:35:47.993
I wonder what time the park opens.

01:36:00.798 --> 01:36:04.468
[laughing] He needs medical attention.

01:36:09.306 --> 01:36:11.142
- Does this hurt?
- Don't touch it.

01:36:12.143 --> 01:36:14.645
[cheering]

01:36:19.316 --> 01:36:21.026
I am so very, very happy

01:36:21.193 --> 01:36:26.657
to introduce to you our new character
in Wonder World,

01:36:26.824 --> 01:36:32.037
named after a man who's most
responsible for my being here today.

01:36:36.083 --> 01:36:39.211
- Axel Fox!
- [crowd cheering]

01:37:02.318 --> 01:37:06.238
Hey, I don't think you've seen
the Tunnel of Love ride, have you, Axel?

01:37:08.282 --> 01:37:12.203
I didn't know y'all had
a Tunnel of Love ride at Wonder World.

01:37:12.369 --> 01:37:14.246
Oh, there will be shortly.

01:37:15.289 --> 01:37:17.291
- A-ha.
- A-ha.
