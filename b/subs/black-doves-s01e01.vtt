11:21.250 --> 11:23.124
but all three of them
met yesterday morning

11:23.125 --> 11:25.208
just before Jason had lunch with you,

11:25.833 --> 11:27.707
and now all three of them are dead.

11:27.708 --> 11:29.875
- [voice breaks] Did he suffer?
- What?

11:32.750 --> 11:33.625
Did he suffer?

11:34.500 --> 11:35.915
Are you listening to me, Helen?

11:35.916 --> 11:38.333
Three people met yesterday,
and now they're dead.

11:38.916 --> 11:43.416
You met Jason straight after that meeting.
You met him, and he gave you something.

11:46.125 --> 11:47.333
Did he suffer?

11:48.708 --> 11:50.083
Dead in less than a minute.

11:51.125 --> 11:52.624
What was in the bag?

11:52.625 --> 11:54.665
Was I the reason he was murdered?
Was I the target?

11:54.666 --> 11:56.165
- We don't know.
- Who killed him?

11:56.166 --> 11:58.124
- We don't know.
- [tense music plays]

11:58.125 --> 11:59.457
- Was it you?
- No.

11:59.458 --> 12:00.582
Was it you?

12:00.583 --> 12:02.541
[woman] No. What was in the bag?

12:04.083 --> 12:07.333
- [sighs shakily] A Christmas present.
- What Christmas present?

12:08.041 --> 12:09.749
- Don't know. Haven't opened it yet.
- Why not?

12:09.750 --> 12:12.124
Well, because it's not
fucking Christmas Day yet, is it?

12:12.125 --> 12:15.124
Did he tell you anything, any information
that might have got him killed?

12:15.125 --> 12:17.374
- No.
- Did he know about who <i>you</i> are?

12:17.375 --> 12:21.165
Could he have approached with the intent
to find out about your true identity?

12:21.166 --> 12:23.540
- No.
- The identity of the Black Doves?

12:23.541 --> 12:25.082
- No.
- Can you be sure of that?

12:25.083 --> 12:27.040
He did not approach me. I approached him.

12:27.041 --> 12:30.040
- What trail is there from him to you?
- None. We were careful.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.166
- I was careful.
- [scoffs] You weren't careful.

12:32.875 --> 12:35.165
You were reckless and stupid.

12:35.166 --> 12:38.415
This was not a job.
It was two people. It was--

12:38.416 --> 12:39.332
It was love?

12:39.333 --> 12:40.332
Yes.

12:40.333 --> 12:42.457
What is clear
is that your relationship with him

12:42.458 --> 12:44.582
has now put you in danger by association.

12:44.583 --> 12:46.082
You might have compromised yourself,

12:46.083 --> 12:48.874
and in doing so,
endangered this entire organization.

12:48.875 --> 12:51.707
Do you understand
how serious this all is, Helen?

12:51.708 --> 12:53.750
If you pull me out,
I'm taking the children.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.874
I am taking the children,

12:56.875 --> 13:00.374
and if you try and stop me,
I will kill you myself.

13:00.375 --> 13:01.665
[breath quivers]

13:01.666 --> 13:03.457
I will bleed you right fucking now.

13:03.458 --> 13:04.416
[knife clicks]

13:07.583 --> 13:10.040
We're not pulling you out.
You're our line into Downing Street.

13:10.041 --> 13:13.249
Count yourself lucky you're the only one
we've got right now, or you would be out.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.540
Are my family in danger?

13:14.541 --> 13:17.040
Don't worry. We're sorting something.
For now, do nothing.

13:17.041 --> 13:19.875
Arouse no suspicion. Stick to protocol.

13:21.666 --> 13:24.625
At least I don't have to worry
about your extramarital affairs anymore.

13:25.708 --> 13:27.207
You've caused an awful lot of trouble,

13:27.208 --> 13:29.916
and a lot of people
are very disappointed with you.

13:34.166 --> 13:35.250
Mrs. Webb.

- Darling.
- Hey. You all right?

13:53.333 --> 13:57.165
The children are still under the table.
They're a bit, um, stronger than me.

13:57.166 --> 13:59.290
- [cheerful string music plays]
- You all right?

13:59.291 --> 14:00.583
Yeah. Um...

14:01.208 --> 14:02.124
It is our party...

14:02.125 --> 14:03.749
- Mm-hmm.
- ...so we have to dance.

14:03.750 --> 14:06.458
- No, let's not do that.
- Yes, yes, we do.

14:08.875 --> 14:11.083
- [Wallace chuckles]
- And a twizzle.

14:11.625 --> 14:12.458
[gasps]

14:12.958 --> 14:14.125
- Thank you.
- Okay.

14:14.708 --> 14:16.665
- [Helen chuckles]
- Okay. Okay?

14:16.666 --> 14:19.624
Very good. Well done.
Well done. [chuckles]

14:19.625 --> 14:21.332
Every year. Every year.

- ...<i>Portcullis House.</i>

- [Jason] <i>Foundation.</i>

Yeah, the, uh, commencement reception.

- Yes, I do. I really needed that drink.

Well, you weren't using it.

16:35.750 --> 16:38.458
Thank you for coming back.
I know you wouldn't have wanted to.

16:39.416 --> 16:41.125
If it was anyone else but her...

16:42.125 --> 16:45.124
Well, that's why you're the one I asked.
You got the crib notes?

16:45.125 --> 16:46.083
Yes.

16:47.041 --> 16:48.291
You didn't wanna step in?

16:49.250 --> 16:50.749
When you thought she was...

16:50.750 --> 16:52.166
What? Starting an affair?

16:53.583 --> 16:55.540
I'd only recently begun
to suspect something.

16:55.541 --> 16:58.082
She's good, covered her tracks,
just not quite well enough.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.333
- She got sloppy.
- Yes. Well, it happens.

17:01.041 --> 17:02.666
And she's too deep to pull out?

17:03.291 --> 17:04.166
[gulps]

17:04.875 --> 17:05.708
Too deep.

17:06.875 --> 17:10.291
You should see her.
The husband, the house, the twins.

17:12.625 --> 17:14.957
She's been feeding us government secrets
for ten years.

17:14.958 --> 17:17.332
I don't need to tell you
how lucrative that's been for us.

17:17.333 --> 17:20.457
Mm. That's why
you call them assets, I suppose.

17:20.458 --> 17:23.540
If her husband finds out
that she's, A, a spy, B, an adulteress,

17:23.541 --> 17:25.124
or, C, God for-fucking-bid, both,

17:25.125 --> 17:28.500
then we're screwed, and she's out,
and I don't even know what happens then.

17:29.666 --> 17:31.749
I want you to find out
if there's someone after her.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.165
If there is,
I want you to remove them as a threat.

17:34.166 --> 17:37.625
- You want me to hunt assassins for you.
- Well, you've hunted everyone else.

17:38.916 --> 17:41.457
It's delicate, this situation, Sam.
She's delicate.

17:41.458 --> 17:43.041
So I need someone I can trust.

17:44.458 --> 17:47.041
And, more importantly,
I need someone <i>she</i> can trust.

17:48.541 --> 17:50.208
And I do believe you owe her.

17:54.125 --> 17:56.166
Right then. Good.

18:01.750 --> 18:06.290
This man she, uh, had an affair with,
did she say why she got involved?

[glass clatters]

18:08.250 --> 18:09.083

We just found out the Chinese
are rejecting the coroner's report

18:40.458 --> 18:44.457

over the ambassador's death.

18:44.458 --> 18:45.457

were all connected.

No. Didn't know any of them.

[Jason breathes anxiously]

23:34.166 --> 23:36.333
[Jason on voicemail] <i>Hi. Uh, it's me. Uh...</i>

23:37.583 --> 23:39.333
<i>I know I shouldn't do this, but, um...</i>

23:40.416 --> 23:42.082
<i>I...</i> [breath trembles]

23:42.083 --> 23:43.666
I think I might be

23:45.250 --> 23:46.166
in trouble.

23:46.708 --> 23:48.958
- [Helen giggles]
- [somber music continues]

[Jason] <i>And you're the only person
I wanted to call.</i>

23:57.791 --> 23:59.165
- [sniffs]
- [Jason breathes shakily]

Can you open the door, please?

25:25.208 --> 25:27.041
[doorbell chimes]

25:29.625 --> 25:30.583
[phone whistles]

25:32.166 --> 25:33.790
[men moaning]

25:33.791 --> 25:34.958
[Daniel] Oh fuck!

25:35.500 --> 25:37.124
[both moan]

25:37.125 --> 25:38.415
[cell phone buzzes]

25:38.416 --> 25:39.416
Oh, don't.

25:40.333 --> 25:41.874
- No!
- I've gotta check that.

25:41.875 --> 25:43.374
Don't, don't, don't.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.082
- I've gotta... just...
- [Daniel] No.

25:45.083 --> 25:46.791
- [buzzing continues]
- [Daniel groans]

[cell phone buzzes]

26:00.708 --> 26:01.666
[sighs]

26:03.375 --> 26:07.666
Good evening, madam. I'm Officer Williams.
This is Officer Kent. Do you live here?

26:08.291 --> 26:11.333
[woman] I own it. I'm the landlady.

26:12.333 --> 26:14.332
[Williams] We're sorry
to bother you so late,

26:14.333 --> 26:17.124
but we're looking for some personal items
belonging to Jason

26:17.125 --> 26:18.749
to help us with our investigation,

26:18.750 --> 26:24.040
like, um... phone, laptop,
recording device, that sort of thing?

26:24.041 --> 26:26.457
Well, I mean, y-you can have a look,

26:26.458 --> 26:29.540
but your colleagues
took everything earlier, so...

26:29.541 --> 26:30.500
Right.

26:31.250 --> 26:32.165
Odd question.

26:32.166 --> 26:34.290
Has he had any guests recently?

26:34.291 --> 26:35.208
A young woman?

26:35.708 --> 26:38.790
Well, his girlfriend's here now.
You can talk to her.

26:38.791 --> 26:40.541
- [Williams] She's here?
- [woman] Upstairs.

26:41.208 --> 26:42.041
Oh.

26:42.541 --> 26:43.957
[silenced gunshots]

26:43.958 --> 26:45.041
[body thuds]

[chiming continues]

26:58.791 --> 26:59.624
[chimes]

26:59.625 --> 27:00.750
[softly] Oh fuck.

27:01.791 --> 27:03.665
<i>- Mummy?</i>
- Mummy's right here, darling.

27:03.666 --> 27:05.957
- Back to bed. I'll be there in a minute.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

27:05.958 --> 27:07.124
Go back to bed, okay?

27:07.125 --> 27:09.457
- <i>But where are you?</i>
- Jacqueline, go back to bed right now!

27:09.458 --> 27:11.332
I will be there in a minute. I love you.

27:11.333 --> 27:13.125

[Helen breathes heavily]

28:36.625 --> 28:38.291
- [shards clatter, crunch]
- [huffs]

28:39.333 --> 28:40.166
Sam.

28:40.833 --> 28:41.750
Hello, darling.

28:44.541 --> 28:45.875
The fucking shotgun?

28:47.708 --> 28:49.375
Yes, it's all I had on me.

28:50.666 --> 28:51.500
[sobs softly]

28:52.875 --> 28:54.249
I can't believe you're here.

28:54.250 --> 28:55.166
I am.

28:56.833 --> 28:58.166
But now we need to go.

28:59.583 --> 29:00.541
Uh, two seconds.

29:02.250 --> 29:03.083
Fuck.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
- [distant sirens wail]
- [grunts]

29:08.458 --> 29:09.291
Fuck.

29:09.916 --> 29:10.750
Fuck.

29:14.833 --> 29:17.457
- [approaching sirens wailing]
- [Helen sighs]

29:17.458 --> 29:18.374
[Helen exhales]

29:18.375 --> 29:21.041
I thought if I ever saw you again,
it would be to retire me.

29:22.083 --> 29:24.332
- You know I'd never take that job.
- [scoffs]

29:24.333 --> 29:25.582
[sirens grow louder]

29:25.583 --> 29:27.707
Unless the money was really good.

29:27.708 --> 29:28.833
[engine starts]

29:30.291 --> 29:32.291
[sirens wail]

29:34.500 --> 29:35.500
[sirens fade]

29:37.541 --> 29:39.665
- [Helen] When did you get back?
- [Sam] This evening.

29:39.666 --> 29:40.874
And who ca...

29:40.875 --> 29:42.333
Reed. Reed called me.

29:45.250 --> 29:46.208
What did she say?

29:46.875 --> 29:48.416
The only thing she needed to.

29:50.166 --> 29:51.333
That you're in trouble.

29:53.333 --> 29:54.708
Who were those two anyway?

29:55.875 --> 29:56.875
Kent and Williams.

29:57.958 --> 29:59.375
Well, just Williams now.

29:59.875 --> 30:02.083
Do you think
they were the ones who killed Jason?

30:02.875 --> 30:03.750
I doubt it.

30:04.666 --> 30:06.457
Jason was killed by a long-range weapon.

30:06.458 --> 30:09.791
They're bullet-to-the-back-of-the-head,
cut-your-throat type girls.

30:13.875 --> 30:14.915
You had twins?

30:14.916 --> 30:18.583
Yeah. [laughs] They're really wonderful.
You'll have to meet them.

30:19.541 --> 30:20.500
And the husband?

30:21.000 --> 30:23.500
Oh, you know, he's still Wallace.

30:24.458 --> 30:26.082
I actually think you'd quite like him.

30:26.083 --> 30:29.082
I mean, apart from the fact
you have absolutely nothing in common.

30:29.083 --> 30:30.540
I don't know what you'd talk about.

30:30.541 --> 30:31.541
[Sam chuckles]

30:33.458 --> 30:35.749
Must be your ten-year
wedding anniversary soon?

30:35.750 --> 30:36.875
[sighs] Yeah.

30:38.500 --> 30:39.333
I just...

30:40.375 --> 30:42.624
I kept meaning to leave,
you know, put an end to it,

30:42.625 --> 30:45.583
but... then I had the kids, and it was just...

30:46.583 --> 30:47.666
It was never the right time.

30:49.875 --> 30:52.333
You know, then Wallace gets
his first Cabinet position.

30:52.833 --> 30:54.875
- They put my rates up.
- [Sam chuckles]

30:55.583 --> 30:57.374
They're doing well in the polls,
snap election.

30:57.375 --> 30:59.541
Suddenly, I'm married
to the defence secretary.

31:00.041 --> 31:01.415
Everyone knows...

31:01.416 --> 31:02.874
<i>everyone</i> knows

31:02.875 --> 31:05.750
in the next reshuffle, he's going
to get something bigger, and then...

31:06.750 --> 31:07.625
Number 10.

31:08.541 --> 31:10.125
- PM's wife.
- [Sam] Mm.

31:11.125 --> 31:12.624
Helen Webb,

31:12.625 --> 31:15.083
the spy at the heart of government.

31:19.083 --> 31:20.750
They told me you fell in love.

31:23.375 --> 31:24.208
Yes.

31:26.875 --> 31:27.791
That was silly.

31:30.166 --> 31:31.166
Wasn't it just?

31:32.541 --> 31:35.583
With a civilian shot by a sniper
on the South Bank,

31:36.250 --> 31:37.958
with a hard drive hidden in his wall.

31:39.833 --> 31:42.000
Must have got himself
involved in something.

31:54.583 --> 31:56.250
- [handbrake clacks]
- [engine stops]

31:59.250 --> 32:00.208
Did you miss it?

32:00.916 --> 32:01.750
What?

32:02.750 --> 32:03.708
Home.

32:07.583 --> 32:08.583
I don't know.

32:10.666 --> 32:11.541
I missed you.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.208
I missed you too.

32:17.958 --> 32:19.749
Hey, I'm sorry about Jason.

32:19.750 --> 32:21.499
And I'm sorry that I...

32:21.500 --> 32:22.833
Well, that I, um,

32:23.958 --> 32:24.875
left you here.

32:26.375 --> 32:28.083
Sam, will you promise me something?

32:30.291 --> 32:32.958
Will you promise me
that you will keep my family safe

32:34.250 --> 32:35.708
and you will keep me alive,

32:37.041 --> 32:39.750
so that I can find out
who killed him and why,

32:41.000 --> 32:42.500
and I can take my revenge

32:43.958 --> 32:45.083
any way I see fit?

32:46.458 --> 32:47.291
Darling,

32:48.875 --> 32:50.666
I will certainly endeavor to try.

33:14.916 --> 33:16.916
[ethereal, pensive music plays softly]

33:42.750 --> 33:43.916
[Helen chuckles softly]

33:49.166 --> 33:50.041
[sighs]

33:52.000 --> 33:53.125
[whispers] I love you.

33:54.458 --> 33:56.333
I love you. I love you. I love you.

34:03.625 --> 34:04.791
[music continues]

34:06.708 --> 34:08.208
[hard drive whirs]

34:09.250 --> 34:10.250
[device trills softly]

34:12.083 --> 34:16.499
[chiming softly]

34:16.500 --> 34:17.416
[trills]

34:22.333 --> 34:24.749
[Helen] <i>You cannot save my number
under my name,</i>

34:24.750 --> 34:27.166
and you have to delete our messages
every day.

34:27.875 --> 34:30.249
- You're paranoid.
- [Helen] I'm being careful.

34:30.250 --> 34:33.708
[Jason] <i>Okay, so what should I save
your number as then?</i>

34:36.125 --> 34:38.125
[serene, contemplative music plays]

34:41.041 --> 34:41.875
[clicks]

35:49.916 --> 35:51.666
[country guitar music plays]

35:59.666 --> 36:02.458
- [bell tinkles]
- [music continues over stereo]

36:03.458 --> 36:04.416
[door closes]

36:05.125 --> 36:06.874
Hello, gorgeous.

36:06.875 --> 36:07.957
[Sam chuckles]

36:07.958 --> 36:09.500
Long fucking time.

36:10.083 --> 36:11.082
Hello, Bingo.

36:11.083 --> 36:13.291
You, uh, here to browse?

36:14.583 --> 36:17.165
[Bingo] I didn't expect to see you
around here again.

36:17.166 --> 36:19.165
I'd heard you'd gone all international.

36:19.166 --> 36:22.832
- Well, you know... no place like home.
- [keys jangle]

36:22.833 --> 36:25.124
[Bingo] Things have changed here
while you've been away.

36:25.125 --> 36:26.165
[Sam] How so?

36:26.166 --> 36:28.541
Well, they've got much fucking worse,
ain't they?

36:29.041 --> 36:31.499
I mean, there's all new agencies in,

36:31.500 --> 36:34.415
all the old networks
are either trying to kill each other

36:34.416 --> 36:37.124
or buy each other out,
and they're all fucking kids!

36:37.125 --> 36:40.415
Twenty-two-year-olds running about
with Uzis all over the place.

36:40.416 --> 36:42.208
I mean, it ain't like in your day.

36:42.791 --> 36:45.499
At least you used to kill people
with a touch of class.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.958
Mm. And class costs extra.

36:48.458 --> 36:50.208
[Bingo] Well, ain't that the truth?

36:51.375 --> 36:56.208
I suppose the question is...
how much damage are you looking to do?

36:57.708 --> 36:59.166
Potentially quite a lot.

37:00.125 --> 37:01.499
[Bingo] Help yourself, kid.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.416
[whimsical, intriguing music plays]

37:11.166 --> 37:12.000
[man] Sam?

37:12.625 --> 37:13.458
Sam!

37:14.583 --> 37:15.833
- Sam!
- [music fades]

37:18.208 --> 37:19.791
[chuckling] What the fuck?

37:20.458 --> 37:21.915
What the fuck?

37:21.916 --> 37:23.499
Hi, Arnie. [chuckles]

37:23.500 --> 37:25.499
I was just...
I was walking along. I looked over.

37:25.500 --> 37:28.374
Out of the corner of my eye,
I see a very handsome man in a nice coat,

37:28.375 --> 37:29.749
and I think, "Well, hello, sir."

37:29.750 --> 37:32.499
And then I fucking look closer,
and it's you. What are you doing here?

37:32.500 --> 37:34.707
- When did you get in?
- Yesterday. I got in yesterday.

37:34.708 --> 37:36.708
- [thumps]
- Without fucking telling me?

37:37.416 --> 37:39.707
- I didn't know, you know... I--
- What?

37:39.708 --> 37:43.499
- [chuckles] I didn't know if you'd--
- Oh, you shut the fuck up right now.

37:43.500 --> 37:46.832
Of course I wanna see you,
and so will Zack.

37:46.833 --> 37:48.540
This is... this is huge.

37:48.541 --> 37:51.082
I was just...
I was thinking about you the other day.

37:51.083 --> 37:53.249
I was just...
Okay, you're coming round for dinner.

Actually, it doesn't matter.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.333
You're coming round anyway, tonight.

37:58.333 --> 37:59.957
Tonight, Samuel.

37:59.958 --> 38:00.875
Yeah.

38:01.458 --> 38:03.249
Yes? I have plans. I will cancel them.

38:03.250 --> 38:05.458
- Don't make me if you're not gonna come.
- I'll come.

38:05.958 --> 38:08.332
Okay. Um, this is a binding contract.

38:08.333 --> 38:10.416
- So put your number in there.
- Okay.

38:11.708 --> 38:14.416
You, uh... you learn the guitar?

38:16.166 --> 38:17.125
Something like that.

38:18.666 --> 38:21.915
- Does Michael know you're here?
- No, and don't tell him. I mean it, Arnie.

38:21.916 --> 38:23.290
I shan't say a word.

38:23.291 --> 38:24.624
[sighs] Fuck.

38:24.625 --> 38:27.040
- It's... it's good to see you.
- Aw. [chuckles]

38:27.041 --> 38:29.874
Actually, it's... it's weird to see you.

38:29.875 --> 38:31.040
But I... I missed you.

38:31.041 --> 38:32.957
You didn't... you didn't call.

38:32.958 --> 38:34.500
- You never called.
- I'm sorry.

38:35.083 --> 38:39.124
So what have you even been doing?
Are you still in insurance?

38:39.125 --> 38:41.165
Yeah, you know how insurance is.

38:41.166 --> 38:42.416
- Yeah.
- [Sam chuckles]

38:43.250 --> 38:45.457
Well, what's seven years between friends?

38:45.458 --> 38:47.290
I will see you later.

38:47.291 --> 38:48.208

- Yeah.

39:56.458 --> 39:58.540
Doesn't Reed want you to leave this to me?

39:58.541 --> 40:02.207
[Helen] <i>Yeah, but, no offense,
you kill people for a living,</i>

40:02.208 --> 40:03.749

[Helen] <i>Something else.
Phillip, the journalist.</i>

40:11.458 --> 40:14.540

[Sam] <i>Sy?</i>

40:15.458 --> 40:18.415
S-Y, yeah, so maybe
that's who the number's connected to.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.082
Yeah. Worth a look.

40:20.083 --> 40:22.915
Right, well, I'm going to get Reed
to run the number.

40:22.916 --> 40:24.415
Well, have her send it to me.

40:24.416 --> 40:26.874
Okay, Sam, I want to be a part of this.

40:26.875 --> 40:29.208

That's what's worrying everyone.

That doesn't sound like you're trying
to find who killed Jason.

if you don't want to. You can tell Sam.

Maybe forever.

wanna talk about him,

what happened between you two.

47:37.291 --> 47:38.375
He never said anything?

47:39.541 --> 47:41.707
[Zack] Just that you...
you had to leave suddenly.

47:41.708 --> 47:44.541
That you had, um... problems, like a...

47:45.875 --> 47:47.041
like a breakdown or something.

47:51.666 --> 47:53.540
He never told you anything more than that?

47:53.541 --> 47:54.457
[Arnie] No.

47:54.458 --> 47:57.000
The closest we ever got to an explanation
was that you're just...

47:57.500 --> 47:59.000
He thought you guys were too different.

48:00.375 --> 48:01.207
Right.

- [Zack] Yeah.

Yeah, he's got a daughter.

- You fucking serious?
- No.

some things should be left in the past,

into the present.

No. Yes.

I mean, what if you just bump into him
in the street?

49:18.375 --> 49:21.874
- It's London. I'm not gonna bump into him.
- [Arnie] I bumped into you.

49:21.875 --> 49:23.749
What are the chances
of that happening twice?

49:23.750 --> 49:25.790
Oh, with you two? Huge.

You can't do anything about it. Trust me.

49:33.791 --> 49:35.041
It's better if he knows.

49:38.750 --> 49:40.290
What did he say when you told him?

49:40.291 --> 49:44.457
Well, I texted him,
and... he didn't reply for an hour.

49:44.458 --> 49:46.249
And then he just wrote back, "Is he okay?"

49:46.250 --> 49:47.540
He said that? "Is he okay?"

49:47.541 --> 49:48.999
- Uh-huh.
