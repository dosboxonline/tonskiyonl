00:38.997 --> 00:43.793
<i>Today is the debut</i>
<i>of YG's newest girl group in seven years.</i>

00:45.378 --> 00:47.464
<i>Introducing BLACKPINK!</i>

01:08.359 --> 01:12.030
<i>Please give it up for BLACKPINK!</i>

01:17.452 --> 01:19.704
Hello, we're BLACKPINK!

01:51.444 --> 01:53.113
- <i>BLACKPINK!</i>
-BLACKPINK!

01:53.196 --> 01:55.031
Congratulations, BLACKPINK.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.533
<i>BLACKPINK!</i>

02:59.137 --> 03:02.849
Seeing so many people love our music

03:02.932 --> 03:08.479
motivates us
to try something new and different.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.024
Why is that delay
so strong right now?

03:53.107 --> 03:54.525
Can you bring it down a bit?

03:54.609 --> 03:56.361
Push it forward a bit.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.558
Hello!

04:32.438 --> 04:33.273
Awesome!

04:39.821 --> 04:41.823
I should've had a nap today.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.618
-I'll slap your wrist. Sleepy right?
-I didn't get a nap.

04:46.828 --> 04:47.662
Better?

05:59.734 --> 06:01.569
It's addictive.

06:05.281 --> 06:08.368
Should we re-record
certain parts of "Crazy Over You"?

06:26.219 --> 06:28.763
Who thinks
they can nail their part in this song?

07:31.117 --> 07:32.827
Oh, that scared me.

08:53.199 --> 08:56.994
This is a three-member group
named Seo Taiji and Boys.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.246
Please welcome them.

09:06.837 --> 09:09.090
Powerful rhythm and flash dances

09:09.173 --> 09:11.384
are the hallmarks of Seo Taiji's music.

09:11.467 --> 09:14.262
They sing well, look cool, and dance well.

09:17.974 --> 09:21.978
The interest in Korean pop music
is unusually high from foreigners.

10:16.407 --> 10:19.160
How many do I have to pick?

10:35.926 --> 10:37.928
You look naturally sexy!

10:38.012 --> 10:40.181
-Really!
-You can't help yourself!

10:40.264 --> 10:43.809
If we wear something,
we all try to see how it fits as a group,

10:43.893 --> 10:46.729
but that's-- Well, it's case by case.

10:48.230 --> 10:51.651
Shouldn't we make it
a bit tighter? What do you think?

10:51.734 --> 10:55.446
-Because this side goes up.
- Mm-mm-mm.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.709
Lisa has diverse tastes.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.215
- What's this?
-Coachella.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.095
I missed my note at the "eh."

12:01.178 --> 12:03.556
See, this is why
we can't watch our old footage.

12:03.639 --> 12:06.559
We're like,
"You missed your note at the 'eh',"

12:06.642 --> 12:09.270
and, "I should've gone slower
at this part of the choreography,

12:09.353 --> 12:10.563
but I did it too quickly."

12:16.527 --> 12:18.738
We were so nervous…

12:26.662 --> 12:28.664
Compared to other stages,

12:28.748 --> 12:31.500
it was much more overwhelming
because we were so nervous.

12:31.584 --> 12:38.174
For us, it was our first time
in a country we weren't familiar with.

12:38.257 --> 12:41.844
I used to dream
of that day when we were trainees.

13:16.128 --> 13:17.922
Jennie's personality?

13:18.714 --> 13:21.383
At first, it was hard getting to know her,

13:21.467 --> 13:22.718
but once we became close,

13:22.802 --> 13:26.430
I could tell that she's very loyal,
very sweet, and a lovely friend.

13:30.976 --> 13:35.648
I see her every day, so I'm used to her,
and she's like my little sister.

13:35.731 --> 13:39.777
But when I see her on TV,
I'm like, "Ah, Jennie is a star,”

13:39.860 --> 13:42.279
but she's really down-to-earth.

13:42.363 --> 13:45.324
You're doing so well.

13:50.412 --> 13:54.250
Slowly.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.585
We're going to lift one leg up
and do an arabesque.

15:32.181 --> 15:35.225
I understand English

15:35.309 --> 15:37.478
better than when I began.

15:37.561 --> 15:41.523
In the beginning,
my friends helped me a lot

15:41.607 --> 15:46.570
and showed me their notes.
Now I can do it by myself.

16:20.604 --> 16:22.272
Good work.

17:18.328 --> 17:19.747
So pretty!

17:28.005 --> 17:29.757
Oh, that’s really long ago.

17:31.008 --> 17:33.677
I used to do a lot
of dark and strong songs.

17:34.678 --> 17:38.098
So I often wonder,
"What am I doing right now?"

17:39.099 --> 17:41.018
It's so different
from what I do now.

17:42.311 --> 17:45.939
Wow!

17:46.023 --> 17:48.609
- Your gestures!
- You're always so cool.

18:01.663 --> 18:05.959
"Wow, there are people born to do this."

18:25.813 --> 18:31.735
My role…
I'm a rapper and also the lead dancer.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.367
Hello.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.541
I love vintage clothes.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.084
So wherever I go,

18:47.167 --> 18:50.254
whether it be America or anywhere else,

18:50.337 --> 18:52.464
I try to look for vintage shops.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.179
This is  1.1 million.

19:00.556 --> 19:03.016
-And this is  320,000.
-And this one?

19:03.100 --> 19:04.685
That's  750,000.

19:04.768 --> 19:06.520
This is  1.1 million?

19:06.603 --> 19:08.564
Yes, because it's from the early '90s.

19:18.031 --> 19:20.701
My mom manages my finances.

19:39.803 --> 19:42.598
I was born in Thailand.

19:44.975 --> 19:48.020
I was born in Buriram Province.

19:49.521 --> 19:53.150
Then I moved to Bangkok when I was three.

19:54.234 --> 19:59.406
My auntie had a music group,

19:59.489 --> 20:04.161
so they had mic stands,
and I always played with them.

20:04.244 --> 20:07.831
I would lower it
until it was the same height as me.

20:07.915 --> 20:10.417
Then I would just dance
and sing to myself.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.961
That was how my mom knew I loved dancing.

20:13.712 --> 20:17.424
So she signed me up
for a course when I was in kindergarten.

20:17.966 --> 20:20.594
This is behind the scenes.

20:20.677 --> 20:23.180
That was how it all began.

20:27.434 --> 20:29.895
She signed me up to many contests…

20:32.397 --> 20:36.068
How long have you
been practicing break dancing?

20:36.151 --> 20:37.653
For a long time.

20:37.736 --> 20:41.740
I participated in a contest.
I was around 12 or 13 years old then.

20:41.823 --> 20:47.329
Then a talent scout told me to try singing
and asked if I wanted to be a singer.

20:47.412 --> 20:51.959
Then I realized
that I loved both singing and dancing.

20:52.668 --> 20:56.129
And YG happened
to have an audition at the time.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.506
So, I made a decision.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.179
Is this an audition?

21:04.263 --> 21:06.223
How many layers are you wearing?

21:06.306 --> 21:07.766
Why are you wearing pants on top too?

21:07.849 --> 21:10.143
-What is this?
- Oh, wow!

21:10.227 --> 21:12.688
-Oh, my God.
- This is amazing.

21:12.771 --> 21:13.605
Wow!

21:13.689 --> 21:14.773
You look so cool.

21:14.856 --> 21:16.692
I'm trying so hard to be cool.

21:17.442 --> 21:21.071
After the audition ended…
…I waited for the call.

21:21.154 --> 21:23.115
I was waiting and waiting.

21:23.198 --> 21:24.908
I waited for the call.

21:24.992 --> 21:29.204
I waited for two months!

21:29.788 --> 21:34.084
And then they called me.
I was like, "What? Is this possible?"

21:40.215 --> 21:43.260
I was a mama's girl.

21:43.343 --> 21:47.180
So, when I had to go to Korea without Mom,

21:47.264 --> 21:49.516
I felt that I had
to take care of myself now.

21:56.815 --> 22:00.027
I didn't speak any Korean.

22:00.110 --> 22:06.325
I only knew how to say "hello,"
so it really was a new start.

22:11.455 --> 22:14.791
Fortunately, there was Jennie.

22:18.462 --> 22:21.631
She was the only one
who could speak English

22:21.715 --> 22:22.674
among the trainees.

22:23.216 --> 22:25.093
I spoke English with her…

22:28.013 --> 22:31.058
…and if something
were to happen, I would talk to her.

22:33.643 --> 22:35.812
That's it.

22:38.273 --> 22:41.568
You choose how to sing it
because we're all doing it differently.

22:47.824 --> 22:51.119
A great thing with us

22:51.203 --> 22:57.459
is everyone wants the best
for the group as a whole.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.382
Okay.

23:03.465 --> 23:06.885
Since we perform as a group,

23:06.968 --> 23:08.512
we try to strike a balance

23:08.595 --> 23:10.222
that works for everyone.

23:11.348 --> 23:12.599
I think.

23:35.747 --> 23:37.290
Sit here, Jisoo.

23:37.999 --> 23:39.418
What do you think?

23:39.501 --> 23:41.711
Do you think I'll be able to learn today?

23:43.338 --> 23:47.467
I think it’ll be nice to learn
how to draw my eyebrows properly.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.970
If you show me, I'll follow it.

23:50.053 --> 23:52.431
-Okay.
-I'm learning from you today.

23:52.514 --> 23:54.391
Do you teach makeup like this too?

23:54.474 --> 23:56.184
- To regular people? Yes.
-Really?

23:56.685 --> 23:58.186
-There are classes for that?
-Of course!

23:58.270 --> 24:00.313
I should've taken
those classes then.

24:00.397 --> 24:02.524
There are people
who come to learn BLACKPINK makeup.

24:02.607 --> 24:03.984
-BLACKPINK makeup?
-Yes.

24:04.067 --> 24:05.360
When I was younger,

24:06.069 --> 24:09.573
my relatives treated me
like an outcast because I was ugly.

24:10.157 --> 24:10.991
What?

24:11.074 --> 24:12.909
They called me a monkey.

24:12.993 --> 24:15.162
It's okay. You're the prettiest one now.

24:17.706 --> 24:22.210
I grew up in Sanbon
in Gunpo city, Gyeonggi-do region.

24:22.794 --> 24:24.504
I lived with my parents,

24:25.046 --> 24:28.383
my sister, my brother,
and my grandparents.

24:29.384 --> 24:32.429
I'm living a very different life

24:32.512 --> 24:36.850
than the one I thought I'd be living.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.769
I used to want to be a writer

24:40.270 --> 24:42.397
or a painter.

24:43.398 --> 24:45.192
Although, I couldn't paint well.

24:46.526 --> 24:49.196
And then I joined
the drama club in 11th grade.

24:49.863 --> 24:52.199
Should I try acting?

24:52.282 --> 24:54.659
They were saying
I should start auditioning for stuff

24:54.743 --> 24:56.578
because I needed the experience.

24:58.288 --> 25:00.165
My first audition was at YG.

25:01.416 --> 25:04.044
I didn't know much at all about YG

25:04.127 --> 25:08.131
before I arrived there the first day.

25:09.216 --> 25:12.552
It felt like something
far removed from me.

25:13.595 --> 25:18.642
I never thought
I'd actually be doing it for real.

25:19.684 --> 25:22.062
How about now?
Do you think I really lost my baby fat?

25:22.145 --> 25:26.233
Back then, it was more baby-like here…

25:26.316 --> 25:28.985
I guess I'll just have to eat ramen
before I sleep tonight.

25:29.069 --> 25:30.695
Maybe then you'll get your old self back.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.239
No, you're perfect right now.

25:32.739 --> 25:34.741
Anyways, you were like a baby back then.

25:35.575 --> 25:38.578
But you're different from back then, too.

25:38.662 --> 25:40.914
-
-You have your own shop!

25:41.456 --> 25:43.208
Who told you to open your own shop?

25:43.291 --> 25:44.918
Say it! Who told you to?

25:45.001 --> 25:45.835
You did.

25:48.171 --> 25:49.130
It was my big plan.

25:50.590 --> 25:52.384
And I'm still planning big things.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.930
I think that
there are very few who truly think,

25:57.013 --> 25:59.391
"This is what I have to do.
This is my path."

25:59.474 --> 26:01.059
People like that are really lucky.

26:02.018 --> 26:03.979
I don't think there are many like that.

30:10.725 --> 30:14.813
She brought a guitar
from Australia, and I was like,

30:14.896 --> 30:17.273
"Play something for us."

30:34.165 --> 30:36.584
- It's really pretty.
- Wow!

30:36.668 --> 30:38.711
Here, stand here.

30:47.929 --> 30:52.392
After my Korean classes
on the fifth floor,

30:52.475 --> 30:56.855
I took the elevators to the basement.

30:56.938 --> 30:58.481
And there was this girl

30:58.565 --> 31:01.067
with short hair, tied back.

31:01.150 --> 31:04.487
It was kind of awkward.

31:04.571 --> 31:07.782
-I was nervous.
-I'm sure you were nervous.

31:08.825 --> 31:10.827
I was like, "Oh! A new girl?"

31:10.910 --> 31:13.538
I was like… so wary of competition.

31:13.621 --> 31:16.165
- Right. Competition.
-Competition, it's so competitive.

31:23.673 --> 31:25.800
We were the same age,

31:25.884 --> 31:28.052
and we had similar tastes.

31:28.136 --> 31:30.638
Since we both came from another country,

31:30.722 --> 31:32.932
we relied on each other
when we were having a hard time.

31:33.016 --> 31:36.436
We become like two peas in a pod.

31:36.519 --> 31:38.646
We were like genuine twins.

31:42.692 --> 31:46.905
And during our days off,
we'd always be together.

32:04.380 --> 32:05.882
Was it hard for you?

32:20.688 --> 32:22.315
When I was having a hard time,

32:22.398 --> 32:24.400
I'd look at Rosé, and she'd be the same.

33:04.232 --> 33:07.610
For me, there were
so many lessons in the beginning.

33:08.569 --> 33:12.407
I took three to four dancing lessons a day
and practiced.

33:12.490 --> 33:16.077
I had vocal lessons
from two to three teachers.

33:16.828 --> 33:17.954
It was a rough time.

34:37.617 --> 34:40.119
For that,
we'd have to plan everything ourselves,

34:40.203 --> 34:41.370
but we each had a role.

34:42.080 --> 34:47.251
If someone was in charge of vocals,
we'd give them that role,

34:47.335 --> 34:50.505
but I always took on
the role of the dancer.

34:51.506 --> 34:53.716
So I'd always design the choreography.

34:54.592 --> 34:57.178
Every month! Literally every month

34:57.261 --> 34:58.137
for five years.

35:00.431 --> 35:03.351
After a monthly review,
you would be graded.

35:04.060 --> 35:07.146
You had those who got an A,
those with Bs and those with Cs.

35:44.016 --> 35:47.812
I rarely went home
and had to practice on the weekends.

35:47.895 --> 35:51.315
So my parents
were quite upset and worried.

35:51.983 --> 35:56.070
But they're not really…

35:56.988 --> 36:00.199
the protective, overbearing type,

36:00.283 --> 36:03.161
and they knew
this was something that I had to do,

36:03.661 --> 36:09.750
so they told me
to stay strong and get it done.

36:37.737 --> 36:41.032
I started a bit later than the others,

36:41.115 --> 36:46.245
so I was able to make memories
with friends and go to school.

36:46.329 --> 36:50.082
I consider it a blessing now.

37:20.071 --> 37:23.282
Waiting was the hardest part.

37:23.366 --> 37:26.786
I didn't think I would make it.
I was on the verge of letting it go.

37:32.166 --> 37:33.542
I'd ask myself,

37:34.168 --> 37:37.672
"Do you want to give up
because it's not easy?"

38:04.448 --> 38:08.452
I had to keep fighting.
I had to give it my all.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.955
"I don't care how long
the training will take."

38:11.038 --> 38:13.833
"Bring it on!
I don't care about that anymore!"

38:29.390 --> 38:32.435
We were evaluated together,

38:33.644 --> 38:37.815
and the four of us did screen tests

38:37.898 --> 38:41.485
and recorded demos together.

38:45.531 --> 38:47.950
It happened naturally.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.329
We just clicked.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.736
When you're working in a group,

39:23.819 --> 39:26.405
everyone has their place and a role.

39:26.489 --> 39:31.118
And when everyone settles
into their roles,

39:31.202 --> 39:34.163
that's how synergy is born.

39:35.414 --> 39:39.627
That realization changed my outlook.
When everyone is where they need to be,

39:39.710 --> 39:41.087
big things can happen.

40:17.498 --> 40:22.253
Teddy felt like a CEO to us.

40:22.336 --> 40:26.924
If somebody did something
with Teddy or met with Teddy…

40:27.007 --> 40:33.973
…it was considered
to be a big deal.

40:36.934 --> 40:39.770
I didn't know much about him.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.814
I knew he was a 1TYM member.

40:57.079 --> 40:58.789
The first time we met was when--

40:58.873 --> 40:59.915
When I was a trainee.

41:03.794 --> 41:08.174
Meeting you
was like the final stage of the debut.

41:08.257 --> 41:11.093
You were the final boss.
If we meet you, we get to debut.

41:11.677 --> 41:12.511
You're right.

41:14.430 --> 41:15.890
<i>Oppa,</i> do you remember…

41:15.973 --> 41:18.017
how we had to record
that whistling sound 1,000 times?

42:02.561 --> 42:04.271
YG Entertainment is expected

42:04.355 --> 42:08.275
to showcase its first new girl group
in seven years since 2NE1 debuted.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.444
<i>Under the direction of producer Teddy,</i>

42:10.528 --> 42:12.780
<i>this new group is being prepared.</i>

42:12.863 --> 42:16.867
<i>Its members and debut songs</i>
<i>have been shrouded in secrecy.</i>

42:18.285 --> 42:19.578
I'm shaking!

42:19.662 --> 42:21.497
-So shaky!
-

42:22.498 --> 42:24.750
"Various… diverse colors…"

42:26.961 --> 42:28.128
How does it go?

42:47.565 --> 42:48.857
Hello everyone.

42:48.941 --> 42:50.943
I'm BLACKPINK's Rosé.

42:51.026 --> 42:53.404
Hello everyone. I'm BLACKPINK's Jennie.

42:53.487 --> 42:54.738
Hello everyone.

42:54.822 --> 42:56.865
I'm BLACKPINK's Jisoo.

42:56.949 --> 43:00.119
Hello everyone. I'm BLACKPINK's Lisa.

43:00.202 --> 43:03.706
Uh… after training
with my members all this time

43:03.789 --> 43:06.083
and finally being able
to debut on this stage,

43:06.166 --> 43:07.793
I'm nervous and excited.

43:07.876 --> 43:10.546
In the future,
we will work hard to show everyone

43:10.629 --> 43:12.965
BLACKPINK's unique colors.

43:13.048 --> 43:14.633
Please love us!

43:15.134 --> 43:16.760
Thank you!

43:18.679 --> 43:21.849
…I think it happened
just the way I thought it would.

43:33.902 --> 43:35.863
I look intense.

43:39.491 --> 43:42.369
Hello.

43:42.453 --> 43:45.039
I can't wait. Can you tell us
who's performing next?

43:45.122 --> 43:47.416
Two of their songs
debuted exclusively at Inkigayo last week

43:47.499 --> 43:48.542
and could be number one!

43:48.626 --> 43:50.210
Shall we see the performance

43:50.294 --> 43:52.296
of BLACKPINK,
the hottest rookies right now?

43:52.379 --> 43:54.256
-Music…
-…start!

44:05.434 --> 44:08.562
<i>YG's new girl group, BLACKPINK,</i>

44:08.646 --> 44:11.649
<i>has reached number one</i>
<i>only 14 days after their debut,</i>

44:11.732 --> 44:15.110
<i>which is the shortest time ever</i>
<i>by a girl group to reach number one.</i>

44:15.194 --> 44:17.488
I remember making our debut

44:17.571 --> 44:19.615
and winning awards.

44:26.163 --> 44:29.333
And feeling like, "Wow! We did it."

44:34.380 --> 44:38.133
"Whistle" kept going up and up,
and when it hit number one,

44:38.217 --> 44:40.177
we were just so happy and excited.

44:45.557 --> 44:47.601
Honestly, I think I was most surprised

44:47.685 --> 44:50.729
when "Whistle" reached number one
on the music charts.

44:50.813 --> 44:52.231
That was the most exciting.

44:52.314 --> 44:53.524
I remember we were…

44:53.607 --> 44:55.693
…in a practice room
when we heard the news

44:55.776 --> 44:56.902
that we were number two.

44:56.985 --> 44:59.613
I kept on checking and checking,
but we had to go to practice.

44:59.697 --> 45:00.656
We'd check every hour.

45:00.739 --> 45:02.658
And then someone came in
and said, "Oh, my God!"

45:04.410 --> 45:06.912
I remember my friends
telling me that they heard it.

45:06.995 --> 45:09.707
They were like, "I'm outside,
and they're playing your song!"

45:09.790 --> 45:11.250
It felt really weird back then.

45:11.333 --> 45:14.670
I was like, "Oh, my God, that's so cool!
Shoot a video! Send me the video!"

45:36.024 --> 45:38.652
Their dance is so powerful.

45:38.736 --> 45:43.073
When their music is played,
you just instantly start dancing.

45:48.203 --> 45:51.790
You can see they love
what they are doing and are born to do it.

46:11.727 --> 46:15.355
When I was a trainee,
nobody knew about me.

46:15.439 --> 46:17.858
But after I debuted as BLACKPINK,

46:17.941 --> 46:21.111
everyone would follow me
no matter where I went.

46:21.195 --> 46:24.740
I didn't know
that we would become this famous.

46:29.411 --> 46:30.537
Three hours.

46:33.499 --> 46:38.295
- Clear in front.
- Everybody get out.

46:47.054 --> 46:48.972
Everybody look into the camera.

46:50.808 --> 46:54.186
Then came the pressure for our next thing.

46:54.269 --> 46:56.730
"What now? What do we do?"

46:56.814 --> 47:01.109
"Let's come up with something fresh."
I felt like we were being chased.

47:10.327 --> 47:12.120
Welcome, BLACKPINK!

47:25.175 --> 47:26.760
Thank you! I love you all!

48:12.723 --> 48:16.018
I still remember the first time…

48:24.902 --> 48:27.070
I went back to Thailand after my debut.

48:27.154 --> 48:30.866
Because Thai teens see me
as a Thai who has made it this far.

48:30.949 --> 48:33.535
They would say, "I want to be like Lisa."

48:36.246 --> 48:37.497
WELCOME HOME LISA
WE MISSED YOU

48:40.709 --> 48:42.628
But at that moment,

48:42.711 --> 48:46.214
I wasn't sure if I was really good enough
to be their role model.

48:47.215 --> 48:48.467
I'm a singer…

48:49.176 --> 48:53.805
but I didn't know
what kind of singer I wanted to be.

48:53.889 --> 48:58.727
I kind of lost the goal.
I was trying to find myself.

49:00.979 --> 49:04.316
Could I really become their role model?

49:04.399 --> 49:07.569
What should I do to not let them down?

49:08.862 --> 49:11.949
These kinds of thoughts
kept running through my mind.

49:32.761 --> 49:35.180
You like this too.
<i>Tanghulu</i> is different.

49:35.263 --> 49:38.350
<i> Tanghulu</i> has
the sweetness of the fruits.

49:38.433 --> 49:41.144
The ratio is a little off
because we haven't made it in a while.

49:41.228 --> 49:43.605
-There was too much sugar.
-It's a bit burnt.

49:44.314 --> 49:45.941
-It still looks delicious.
-Yeah.

49:52.280 --> 49:54.616
We almost started a fire once.

49:54.700 --> 49:57.452
-We were making too much.
-Yeah, we almost burnt it.

49:57.536 --> 50:00.122
We almost made
this dorm disappear.

50:11.174 --> 50:13.844
- How is it?
-Mm.

50:13.927 --> 50:15.303
Is it good? I want a taste.

50:15.887 --> 50:16.722
It's warm.

50:18.849 --> 50:19.891
It's a bit burnt.

50:31.695 --> 50:33.488
No. We didn't add any water.

50:33.572 --> 50:37.826
-What are you talking about?
-No, you don't add water.

50:37.909 --> 50:40.120
<i>Unnie!</i> You add water.

50:40.203 --> 50:42.748
You add water? No, you don't add water.

50:42.831 --> 50:46.001
What am I going to do about you?
Nothing works without me.

51:00.766 --> 51:02.726
It's like--

51:02.809 --> 51:04.061
Other places don't have it.

51:23.455 --> 51:28.585
When I first came to train as a singer,

51:28.668 --> 51:32.089
I had never tried
singing or dancing before.

51:32.172 --> 51:35.634
I was lost, but you taught me a lot.

51:35.717 --> 51:40.347
For two of us, it was--
The competition was fierce at the time.

51:40.430 --> 51:42.933
There were about 20 to 30 trainees.

51:43.016 --> 51:46.019
Because we are
the older ones of the group,

51:46.103 --> 51:48.522
the others came to us
with the issues they were having.

51:48.605 --> 51:53.193
I knew what their problems were.
They'd ask us, "<i>Unnie</i>,<i> </i>what should we do?"

51:53.276 --> 51:57.030
And I'd advise them to speak their mind,
but they have a hard time doing that,

51:57.114 --> 51:58.949
so I end up taking care of it.

52:01.284 --> 52:04.663
There's no doubt
I feel a sense of responsibility.

52:04.746 --> 52:07.374
I try the best I can
to take care of the other girls.

52:16.591 --> 52:19.427
Semi-success.

54:12.165 --> 54:15.126
♪ <i>After two, three o’clock… ♪</i>

54:15.919 --> 54:18.964
<i>♪ When I call you ♪</i>

54:19.047 --> 54:22.676
<i>♪ And when you see my call… ♪</i>

54:23.802 --> 54:25.053
Something like that.

54:26.137 --> 54:28.515
-I think it's fine.
-I want to hide right now.

54:28.598 --> 54:32.352
-No.
-I don't think I can do this.

57:08.758 --> 57:10.093
Kuma!

57:24.274 --> 57:27.068
I have so many clothes,
but there's not enough space,

57:27.152 --> 57:29.154
so I keep them on the balcony.

57:29.237 --> 57:32.115
Don't we have to pack
for the event in Japan?

57:32.198 --> 57:34.617
You have to bring
something like this. It's cold.

57:34.701 --> 57:37.579
-Bring a scarf too.
-Oh, I don't have a scarf!

57:37.662 --> 57:39.664
-Give me one.
-You are funny.

57:39.747 --> 57:42.083
-Give me one.
-I can't.

57:42.167 --> 57:43.877
That's not a scarf.

57:43.960 --> 57:47.088
It is so tiring when we work,

57:47.172 --> 57:50.258
but when we don't work,
I get stressed out about not working.

57:50.341 --> 57:52.594
I think it's that. It's a dilemma.

57:52.677 --> 57:55.221
When we work, I really want to rest,

57:55.305 --> 57:59.058
but when we don't work,
I end up wondering, "What am I doing?"

58:00.310 --> 58:02.437
This job has a lot of ups and downs.

58:02.520 --> 58:04.147
There's nothing we can do about it.

58:04.772 --> 58:09.819
It's very random,
and there's no regularity.

58:11.863 --> 58:15.074
The thing is, you can never tell
how long this will last,

58:15.158 --> 58:17.911
so estimating is impossible.
That's most challenging.

58:48.983 --> 58:52.153
I think we were together for three years

58:52.237 --> 58:54.822
before we went on the world tour.

58:59.744 --> 59:03.164
We started the world tour in Asia,

59:03.248 --> 59:09.087
but Coachella marked the start
of our tour in North America.

59:14.884 --> 59:17.929
And blow them kisses here and stuff,

59:18.012 --> 59:21.349
because you're coming out
during the chorus before you kiss.

59:21.432 --> 59:22.559
Oh, the next chorus?

59:22.642 --> 59:24.811
You're coming out
during the chorus before you kiss.

59:24.894 --> 59:26.563
You want me
to come out before that chorus?

59:26.646 --> 59:27.939
Come out slowly and play here.

59:28.022 --> 59:30.358
It was getting boring
when you stay out there for too long.

59:31.067 --> 59:37.282
A much more diverse group of fans

59:37.365 --> 59:39.242
will be looking forward to seeing us.

59:42.620 --> 59:46.833
Whether it be
"Playing With Fire" or "Boombayah"…

59:47.625 --> 59:49.419
you don't look like
you're dancing hard enough.

59:49.502 --> 59:51.879
-We're not dancing hard enough?
-Not hard enough.

59:51.963 --> 59:57.302
The audience needs
to be mesmerized by your energy, up close.

59:57.385 --> 1:00:00.597
I know that you guys know the dance well,
but put in a bit more effort.

1:00:00.680 --> 1:00:02.640
Jisoo, you need to get the notes right.

1:00:02.724 --> 1:00:04.976
You messed up
on the rhythm before, right? Too fast?

1:00:05.059 --> 1:00:07.353
I practiced with MR
for the first time when I got here.

1:00:07.437 --> 1:00:09.939
The notes are
a bit unstable when you first go in.

1:00:10.023 --> 1:00:12.317
But we shouldn't have said that on camera.

1:00:12.400 --> 1:00:13.568
Hey…

1:00:15.028 --> 1:00:16.404
They'll never air this.

1:00:21.075 --> 1:00:24.162
<i>The media says</i>
<i>that K-pop queens have landed.</i>

1:00:27.498 --> 1:00:32.503
Girl group BLACKPINK heat up
their first world tour stop, Thailand.

1:00:33.671 --> 1:00:40.094
It's special to have a concert
in Lisa's hometown.

1:00:42.847 --> 1:00:48.061
This is the first concert
where BLACKPINK has been able

1:00:48.144 --> 1:00:49.979
to meet our Thai fans.

1:00:50.063 --> 1:00:52.857
We will do our very best
and will not disappoint the BLINKS.

1:01:05.912 --> 1:01:08.081
I want to give a performance

1:01:08.164 --> 1:01:10.875
that I can look at and be content with.

1:01:11.626 --> 1:01:14.087
My focus is leaving the stage
having given a performance

1:01:14.170 --> 1:01:15.463
I have no regrets about.

1:01:17.715 --> 1:01:21.844
So when I get out there,
I'm thinking, "Don't mess this up."

1:01:24.347 --> 1:01:25.682
"You've got to nail this."

1:01:52.625 --> 1:01:57.547
Everything was new to me on my first tour.

1:01:58.464 --> 1:02:01.467
It was so great
to meet so many fans around the world.

1:02:36.377 --> 1:02:39.756
- It feels like it's sprained.
-Is it worse on this side?

1:03:11.204 --> 1:03:13.581
I’m going to eat it without ketchup.

1:03:36.854 --> 1:03:41.359
I'm hungry,
so I ordered something simple.

1:03:52.954 --> 1:03:54.080
Delicious.

1:04:10.388 --> 1:04:14.350
If someone is fed up one day…

1:04:16.519 --> 1:04:20.398
…she makes that person laugh.

1:04:20.481 --> 1:04:23.109
She keeps us energized.

1:04:27.738 --> 1:04:30.950
…I think I overreact a lot.

1:04:31.033 --> 1:04:35.288
Or I tend to try
to bring too much positivity

1:04:35.371 --> 1:04:37.456
when the mood is sour.

1:05:41.979 --> 1:05:44.523
Because it's such a big festival,

1:05:44.607 --> 1:05:46.442
when I was told that we were going,

1:05:46.525 --> 1:05:47.652
I couldn't believe it.

1:05:53.074 --> 1:05:54.367
Is this for real?

1:05:56.911 --> 1:05:58.621
Look over there!

1:06:13.928 --> 1:06:17.390
Since we don't have much time…

1:06:23.896 --> 1:06:27.650
I was so nervous because I didn't know

1:06:27.733 --> 1:06:30.611
how our American fans would react.

1:06:59.265 --> 1:07:01.767
I was so sick.

1:07:02.435 --> 1:07:05.646
That was the sickest I've ever been.

1:07:05.730 --> 1:07:09.942
My back was killing me. It hurt to move.

1:07:10.609 --> 1:07:14.321
-I was pretty worried.
-We were very worried.

1:07:18.284 --> 1:07:21.287
Break a leg.

1:07:21.370 --> 1:07:22.788
We're following Coachella.

1:07:29.587 --> 1:07:31.297
When I got onto that stage,

1:07:31.380 --> 1:07:34.508
I actually didn't realize
that there were so many people.

1:07:37.845 --> 1:07:39.513
Why are there so many people?

1:07:39.597 --> 1:07:40.723
I don't know.

1:07:40.806 --> 1:07:42.308
There are so many people.

1:07:46.645 --> 1:07:50.357
- We can do it.
- We can do it. It's fine.

1:07:50.441 --> 1:07:52.234
One, two, three! Go!

1:07:52.318 --> 1:07:54.028
Jennie and Rosé, that way.

1:07:54.111 --> 1:07:56.072
Water, water, water!

1:07:58.324 --> 1:08:00.034
Eye drops, somebody!

1:08:00.618 --> 1:08:02.369
Relax.

1:08:03.037 --> 1:08:05.331
We're starting now!

1:08:10.795 --> 1:08:14.590
I was so nervous.
The moment I stepped foot on the stage

1:08:14.673 --> 1:08:19.595
and saw all the crowds
shouting and cheering…

1:08:22.181 --> 1:08:27.394
…I got the feeling, "This is it!"

1:09:12.523 --> 1:09:17.319
All races and all kinds
of people came together there.

1:09:17.403 --> 1:09:20.156
So it helped emphasize…

1:10:37.983 --> 1:10:41.946
It makes me feel that…
I had chosen the right path.

1:10:42.029 --> 1:10:44.865
This was what
I really wanted to do in my life.

1:11:23.195 --> 1:11:28.450
After Coachella, I think I figured out

1:11:28.534 --> 1:11:31.704
how to have fun on stage.

1:11:31.787 --> 1:11:33.872
Don't concentrate on just yourself,

1:11:33.956 --> 1:11:36.125
but feed off this passion
raging around you.

1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:02.026
It doesn't matter if we grow old

1:12:02.109 --> 1:12:03.902
and get replaced
by a new younger generation.

1:12:03.986 --> 1:12:06.572
As long as there is still
someone talking about us.

1:12:06.655 --> 1:12:09.450
Because they will still remember
how we shone so bright.

1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:46.231
I don't cry.

1:14:46.315 --> 1:14:49.193
I don't cry. I cry last.

1:15:02.831 --> 1:15:05.584
Watch your step. Be careful.

1:15:05.667 --> 1:15:08.086
Good work!

1:15:08.170 --> 1:15:09.004
Bye!

1:15:15.719 --> 1:15:17.804
A fan?

1:16:14.027 --> 1:16:15.612
Meat, meat!

1:16:16.113 --> 1:16:17.656
Careful of the hot plate.

1:16:17.739 --> 1:16:20.659
- That looks amazing!
- Can I have a bite?

1:16:23.954 --> 1:16:25.914
- Do you know us?
-Yes.

1:16:25.998 --> 1:16:28.458
-Weren't you here before?
- Yes, that's right.

1:16:28.542 --> 1:16:31.211
-We were here when we were trainees.
- Yes, you guys ate here.

1:16:31.295 --> 1:16:34.590
-I remember.
- I've been here since the start.

1:16:34.673 --> 1:16:36.633
I didn't give you good service.

1:16:36.717 --> 1:16:38.635
Really?
Is that why you're so nice now?

1:16:38.719 --> 1:16:40.220
Yes. I hope you enjoy the food.

1:16:40.304 --> 1:16:42.180
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1:16:42.681 --> 1:16:43.515
Totally.

1:16:44.057 --> 1:16:46.351
Halsey contacted me all of a sudden.

1:16:46.435 --> 1:16:47.644
She was at Paris?

1:17:03.493 --> 1:17:07.122
- I want to live in Paris.
-Me too! For a year.

1:17:07.205 --> 1:17:10.542
-We will stay for a year.
- You're Parisian already.

1:17:10.626 --> 1:17:13.170
After a year, I'd like to go to the US.

1:17:13.253 --> 1:17:17.424
I want to live in Paris, but I also want
to live in the US and England.

1:17:17.507 --> 1:17:18.717
Twenty years?

1:17:20.177 --> 1:17:23.055
I feel like Lisa
would be traveling around the world.

1:17:36.860 --> 1:17:38.695
…I think we'd all be married.

1:17:38.779 --> 1:17:40.906
We'd have babies by then.
Forty-two, 44…

1:17:40.989 --> 1:17:42.407
We'll have children?

1:17:42.491 --> 1:17:43.617
If not,

1:17:43.700 --> 1:17:46.703
we could also get married later in life.

1:17:47.287 --> 1:17:48.914
We'll be freshly married?

1:17:48.997 --> 1:17:50.707
No newborns!

1:17:51.291 --> 1:17:54.127
Aren't we going to make a comeback?

1:17:54.211 --> 1:17:55.587
At that age?

1:17:55.671 --> 1:17:57.881
BLACKPINK!

1:17:57.964 --> 1:17:59.716
We'll injure our backs!

1:17:59.800 --> 1:18:02.511
I don't think we'll be able to dance.

1:18:03.887 --> 1:18:05.097
We'll have to stand.
