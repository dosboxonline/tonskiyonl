[ominous music playing]

00:02.961 --> 00:06.715
[boy] "There was no reason for what I did.
I loved the old man.

00:07.424 --> 00:08.842
He had never wronged me.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.971
For his gold, I had no desire.

00:14.139 --> 00:15.515
I think it was his eye.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.184
He had the eye of a vulture.

00:19.561 --> 00:23.273
Whenever it fell upon me,
my blood ran cold.

00:23.940 --> 00:27.694
And so I made up my mind
to kill the old man

00:27.777 --> 00:31.740
and rid myself of the eye forever.

00:32.532 --> 00:36.494
Every night I looked in upon him
while he slept.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.289
Until the old man's hour had come.

00:40.123 --> 00:43.460
With a loud yell, I leaped into the room.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.462
He shrieked once.

00:45.545 --> 00:48.298
In an instant, I dragged him to the floor

00:48.381 --> 00:50.383
and pulled the heavy bed over him.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.427
He was stone dead.

00:52.510 --> 00:54.012
I dismembered the corpse.

00:54.929 --> 00:58.058
I cut off the head, the arms and the legs.

00:58.683 --> 01:01.519
But before long, my head ached.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.898
I fancied a ringing in my ear.

01:04.981 --> 01:09.861
The noise increased,
a low, dull, quick sound.

01:10.779 --> 01:15.617
I gasped for breath,
but the noise steadily increased.

01:17.202 --> 01:23.124
I paced the floor to and fro,
I foamed, I raved, I swore.

01:23.875 --> 01:28.630
I swung the chair above the bed over him,
but the noise increased.

01:28.713 --> 01:32.884
It grew louder, louder, louder!

01:33.760 --> 01:34.886
Here, here.

01:35.470 --> 01:39.307
It is the beating of his hideous heart."

01:39.390 --> 01:41.392
[tapping on floorboards continues]

01:45.688 --> 01:46.981
Did you see his face?

01:47.065 --> 01:49.359
I thought he was gonna have
a heart attack.

01:49.442 --> 01:52.278
-How much time's left?
-Four minutes.

01:52.362 --> 01:55.198
I say we go in now
before he has a heart attack.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.533
He knew the rules.

01:56.616 --> 01:59.702
You can't be afraid of the dark
and be in the Poe Society.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.956
Jimmy? Yo, everything okay down there?

02:03.039 --> 02:04.666
[Jimmy coughing] Help, help!

02:08.336 --> 02:09.420
Help me!

02:09.504 --> 02:11.798
What...? Call 911!

02:21.307 --> 02:23.601
[dramatic music playing]

02:23.685 --> 02:26.938
If one of these four guys is Rakitin,
I can't prove it.

02:27.021 --> 02:29.190
You accessed their hard drives,
data profile?

02:29.274 --> 02:30.859
I did. CIA, DIA, State.

02:30.942 --> 02:34.654
If one of these analysts is leaking intel,
I couldn't tell you how.

02:34.737 --> 02:38.032
Which tells me
that however cautious Rakitin was before,

02:38.116 --> 02:39.993
he's being more cautious now.

02:40.076 --> 02:43.955
Follow them. Tell Park to pull
whatever resources she needs.

02:44.038 --> 02:45.582
I have to meet Reddington.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.668
-Captain Kidd.
-The pirate.

02:49.210 --> 02:52.297
The only pirate who actually
buried his treasure,

02:52.380 --> 02:54.632
along the coast of East Hampton.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.634
The irony abounds.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.595
We're talking about a child's overdose?

02:58.678 --> 03:01.514
-[Raymond] Yes. On buried treasure.
-Fentanyl.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.142
[Raymond] That he thought
was nothing more than dust.

03:04.225 --> 03:06.311
An innocent and tragic mistake

03:06.394 --> 03:10.732
that confirms my decision
as to the next name on the Blacklist.

03:10.815 --> 03:11.900
[Cooper] <i>Captain Kidd.</i>

03:11.983 --> 03:15.069
Your drop site is swarming with cops.
They could trace the drugs to me.

03:15.153 --> 03:18.823
-You promised me.
-I promised you a safe drop.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.658
Ted here screwed that up.

03:20.742 --> 03:23.286
I want you to know
Ted won't screw up again.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.246
[muffled grunting]

03:27.832 --> 03:32.128
[Raymond] <i>Captain Kidd is</i>
<i>a glorified middleman who facilitates</i>

03:32.211 --> 03:35.757
criminal transactions
by guaranteeing payment,

03:35.840 --> 03:39.928
pickup and delivery
between otherwise warring factions.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.512
By using hidden treasure?

03:41.596 --> 03:43.640
GPS-tagged hiding spots.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.642
Like an abandoned house
where he can hide drugs

03:45.725 --> 03:48.228
where no one could find them
except for a group of kids.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.855
He takes possession of an item for sale,

03:50.939 --> 03:54.234
hides it and informs
the buyer of its location

03:54.317 --> 03:57.028
once payment has been made
in the same fashion.

03:57.111 --> 03:58.905
Like geocaching for narcotics.

03:58.988 --> 04:02.825
Narcotics or contraband or people.

04:03.868 --> 04:04.994
He hides people?

04:05.078 --> 04:08.206
Yes, which is why
this case is of some urgency.

04:08.289 --> 04:09.707
Someone's been abducted?

04:09.791 --> 04:13.378
Not yet. But I believe she will be
if we don't act quickly.

04:13.461 --> 04:14.379
Who?

04:14.462 --> 04:16.256
Safiya Maroun.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.840
[Cooper] Was born in Riyadh.

04:17.924 --> 04:20.885
In 2006, she was committed
to a mental institution

04:20.969 --> 04:23.721
for defying her male guardian's wishes.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.848
She was granted asylum in America

04:25.932 --> 04:28.810
and has since become
one of the most prominent opponents

04:28.893 --> 04:32.188
of Saudi Arabian repression
and is the founder of Brighter Path,

04:32.272 --> 04:36.442
an organization that helps get women
and people in the LGBTQ+ community

04:36.526 --> 04:38.569
out of countries with oppressive regimes.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.947
-The woman's a hero.
-[Cooper] And a target.

04:41.030 --> 04:42.240
Of Neville Townsend.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.700
[Cooper] According to Reddington,

04:43.783 --> 04:46.536
<i>Townsend's been contracted</i>
<i>by the Saudi secret police</i>

04:46.619 --> 04:48.454
<i>to abduct Maroun</i>
<i>from her home in Maryland.</i>

04:48.538 --> 04:51.249
<i>I've notified Hyattsville PD.</i>
<i>Meet them on-site.</i>

04:51.332 --> 04:53.042
Has anyone spoken to Maroun?

04:53.126 --> 04:55.920
I tried, but it's late.
Could be her phone's turned off.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.131
[suspenseful music playing]

05:00.675 --> 05:04.012
[shrieks] No! Not my baby!

05:05.805 --> 05:07.890
No! Get off me!

05:07.974 --> 05:10.310
I just heard from my people. It's done.

05:11.019 --> 05:14.731
-She'll be here within the hour.
-What if we're too late?

05:14.814 --> 05:18.776
She'll be buried alive
until Saudi secret service pays Townsend.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.696
At which point this Captain Kidd
will give them the coordinates

05:21.779 --> 05:23.823
so the Mabahith can dig her up
and kill her.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.783
That's right. So don't be late.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.620
-Where's Park?
-Hunting down Rakitin.

05:29.704 --> 05:32.248
So he can confirm
Reddington's a Russian plant?

05:32.332 --> 05:35.084
Mr. Reddington's a traitor,
Agent Keen's thrown in with a man

05:35.168 --> 05:38.337
who abducts human-rights activists,
and we're hunting for a pirate

05:38.421 --> 05:39.922
that buries people alive.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.717
I never should've left the circus.

05:44.093 --> 05:46.095
[indistinct radio chatter]

05:47.764 --> 05:49.599
So much for not being too late.

05:53.561 --> 05:56.105
-Has the husband made a statement?
-Not yet.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.149
-He's in surgery.
-[Ressler] Neighbors?

05:58.232 --> 06:01.194
-A passerby? Anybody see anything?
-Afraid not.

06:01.277 --> 06:03.279
Maybe this is his statement.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.495
-Who's Nora?
-Eleanor. The oldest daughter.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.705
First we thought maybe
the girl got taken too.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.083
She and her sister are accounted for.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.293
His wife's being abducted,
he doesn't know by whom,

06:17.376 --> 06:21.798
and he uses what little strength he has
to write his daughter's name? Why?

06:22.381 --> 06:24.175
Maybe because it's not a name.

06:26.302 --> 06:29.972
-Kidnappers disarmed the system.
-To avoid tripping the alarm.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.767
[Ressler] And to prevent the abduction
from being videotaped.

06:32.850 --> 06:37.313
Yes. But what I'm interested in
happened before the abduction.

06:39.690 --> 06:42.276
Hello. Who might you be?

06:42.360 --> 06:46.114
I need an APB on a late-model Escalade.
Gray. No plates.

06:46.989 --> 06:51.077
-I read up on you. I'm a fan of your work.
-I'm begging you. Please.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.329
Nothing will happen to you on my watch.

06:53.412 --> 06:54.705
Please don't do this!

06:54.789 --> 06:57.583
You'll have plenty of air,
nice warm clothes.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.378
Just breathe easily
and this will be over soon.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.130
[Maroun] Don't do this!

07:02.713 --> 07:03.714
Stop!

07:06.968 --> 07:08.511
Don't do this!

07:08.970 --> 07:10.263
[Maroun speaking indistinctly]

07:11.764 --> 07:13.141
She's an inspiration.

07:14.183 --> 07:17.103
Which is exactly
what the royal family fears.

07:17.186 --> 07:19.814
Making her a martyr will only make her
more inspirational.

07:19.897 --> 07:22.233
-People will take her place.
-I hope so.

07:22.316 --> 07:26.404
The royal family pays top dollar
to make their competition disappear.

07:27.029 --> 07:28.322
[Maroun] Don't do this!

07:33.494 --> 07:35.580
[dramatic music playing]

07:35.663 --> 07:36.873
[Rakitin] <i>Hey. It's me.</i>

07:36.956 --> 07:39.542
I have something you may be interested in.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.170
Opera? Aliens? Freeganism?

07:42.253 --> 07:45.423
I'm interested in any number of topics.
Most anything.

07:45.506 --> 07:48.092
Except accounting.
This isn't about accounting, is it?

07:48.176 --> 07:50.511
It's about the intercept out of China.

07:50.595 --> 07:51.846
The pending cyberattack.

07:52.513 --> 07:53.890
I am interested.

07:53.973 --> 07:58.311
Then we should talk.
How about the fountains? In Meridian Hill?

07:58.394 --> 08:01.439
I'd prefer something
a little more intimate.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.484
Come to the restaurant. Third and North.

08:04.567 --> 08:08.946
We're closed for renovations,
so I can promise us a quiet corner.

08:12.408 --> 08:14.118
We've been looking for you.

08:14.202 --> 08:17.038
-Where have you been?
-It's, uh, sort of a long story.

08:17.121 --> 08:18.456
I hope it has a happy ending.

08:18.539 --> 08:21.083
We found the Escalade
from Maroun's abduction.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.960
It was abandoned and scrubbed.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.588
-And the husband?
-Ressler questioned him.

08:25.671 --> 08:28.132
-He doesn't know anything.
-Well, I might.

08:28.216 --> 08:31.344
Uh, I reached out to Cybercrime
to provide us with a list

08:31.427 --> 08:34.305
of any online drug dealers
who have informants

08:34.388 --> 08:36.349
that we could question about Captain Kidd

08:36.432 --> 08:39.268
or how he's distributing product
using street-tech workarounds.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.938
I spoke to DEA. They don't have anything.

08:42.021 --> 08:45.358
Which is why I spent all night
buying mephedrone, cocaine

08:45.441 --> 08:47.568
and MDMA on the dark web.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.656
-You bought illegal drugs?
-I did. Which was terrifying.

08:51.739 --> 08:54.534
On the upside,
one of the dealers asked to meet

08:54.617 --> 08:58.162
near a taco truck in LeDroit Park
that is worth the drive.

08:58.829 --> 08:59.997
Sounds delicious.

09:00.081 --> 09:03.459
You have no idea, sir.
They have a chicken mole that is...

09:04.293 --> 09:05.294
Try and stay focused.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.421
Of the 16 dealers I purchased from,

09:07.505 --> 09:12.260
eight are shipping to me directly,
seven met to hand off in person...

09:12.343 --> 09:15.304
-And the last one?
-Just texted me coordinates,

09:15.388 --> 09:17.723
photos and directions
of where the drugs are.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.308
They're using Captain Kidd.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.894
It's a geotagged hiding spot
in Penn Quarter.

09:21.978 --> 09:26.190
Take Ressler. Pull the drugs,
along with surveillance feeds of the area.

09:26.274 --> 09:29.735
Let's hope your online shopping spree
turns up more than great chicken mole.

09:30.778 --> 09:33.281
[suspenseful music playing]

10:16.741 --> 10:18.117
[cell phone dialing]

10:18.200 --> 10:19.243
[line ringing]

10:19.327 --> 10:20.620
[cell phone ringing]

10:23.164 --> 10:24.915
-Yes?
-[Rakitin] <i>Gotta call it off.</i>

10:24.999 --> 10:27.126
-Why? What's going on?
-I got a tail.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.045
I'll call you back.

11:17.259 --> 11:20.012
-Sure this is the right location?
-Look at the photo.

11:20.096 --> 11:24.517
Instructions said back corner of the park.
Third light post from the south.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.895
It's supposed to be inside
the broken solar assembly.

11:27.978 --> 11:30.564
-Think someone else found it?
-Maybe they knew it was a setup

11:30.648 --> 11:32.983
-and got cold feet.
-There's no surveillance.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.443
No obvious cameras.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.904
They chose this location
because it's a digital dark spot.

11:36.987 --> 11:40.282
Oh, my God.
What if somebody else found those drugs?

11:40.366 --> 11:43.953
-What if a child found those drugs?
-Hey. Check it out.

11:47.248 --> 11:50.251
I don't get it.
You think Captain Kidd took a cab?

11:50.334 --> 11:53.379
No. I think
that cab took Captain Kidd's picture.

11:56.382 --> 12:00.803
The driver didn't witness anything,
but his dash cam caught the drop.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.973
[Cooper] White male, late twenties.

12:04.056 --> 12:06.475
Is the image strong enough
for facial recognition?

12:06.559 --> 12:09.687
Resolution isn't the problem.
We just don't have a viable angle.

12:09.770 --> 12:11.147
It's only these 22 seconds.

12:11.230 --> 12:14.692
The cab only caught the end.
The kid walks out of frame.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.570
What's that? The cup in his hand.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.322
[keyboard clacking]

12:21.532 --> 12:24.076
Kitt's Coffee.
They make a mean mochaccino.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.704
They only have a few locations
in the city.

12:26.787 --> 12:30.583
Pull sales records and surveillance feeds
from any of their stores in a mile radius.

12:30.666 --> 12:33.919
If the kid paid with a credit card,
chances are we've got his address.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.421
Get it and get him here.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.885
You can't prove that my client is
the person in that footage.

12:40.968 --> 12:42.761
[Ressler] We know you work
for Captain Kidd.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.306
-I don't, I told you.
-What's gonna happen

12:45.389 --> 12:48.392
when we pull your prints off the drugs
we found in the park?

12:48.476 --> 12:51.312
-Or the drugs in your apartment?
-Mr. Moore is--

12:51.395 --> 12:55.357
-Mr. Moore is going to jail.
-Okay, look, I'm telling the truth.

12:56.484 --> 12:59.695
Okay, I... He's not my employer.

12:59.778 --> 13:01.780
I don't work for Kidd.
I've been robbing him.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.657
Robbing him of what?

13:04.450 --> 13:08.954
It's all kinds of stuff. It's weapons,
stolen credit cards, fake IDs.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.206
Narcotics.

13:12.124 --> 13:15.294
-Yeah, narcotics.
-[attorney] Allegedly narcotics.

13:15.377 --> 13:18.172
It's not just me. I'm not the only seeker.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.966
-What's a seeker?
-You do not have to answer.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.927
Explain to your mouthpiece here

13:23.010 --> 13:25.137
that I'm gonna have a warrant
at your residence

13:25.221 --> 13:27.223
before you walk out of this door.

13:27.306 --> 13:30.851
You need to cooperate if you wanna
have any hope of staying out of jail.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.311
Can you tell him that?

13:34.480 --> 13:35.814
Go ahead, Jarret.

13:39.318 --> 13:43.239
Captain Kidd uses droppers
to stash his product.

13:43.322 --> 13:47.409
How much product, how many droppers,
I don't know, but it's a lot.

13:48.035 --> 13:51.539
We track what we can,
follow a dropper, look for his stash.

13:51.622 --> 13:55.042
We know it was drugs you stole
from that stash in the park.

13:55.125 --> 13:59.004
I got a feeling the drug test would prove
they're in your system right now.

13:59.088 --> 14:02.174
-Hold on.
-What if I forgot about that drug test?

14:04.093 --> 14:05.386
In exchange for...?

14:05.469 --> 14:08.514
You hand over whatever contraband
you have on hand,

14:08.597 --> 14:11.767
whatever you stole
from these GPS-tagged hiding spots.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.645
If that evidence helps me
find Captain Kidd,

14:14.728 --> 14:16.605
I'll help you stay out of jail.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.404
What the hell happened?

14:23.487 --> 14:27.324
I'll tell you what happened.
I was tailed by the FBI.

14:30.119 --> 14:35.040
This guy, Cooper, he's not standing down
like you said he would.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.877
We need to do something about him.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.970
[pensive music playing]

14:53.767 --> 14:56.604
Hey. Came as quick as I could.
What's so urgent?

14:56.687 --> 14:59.565
I ran a test on the narcotics
you pulled from Moore's apartment.

14:59.648 --> 15:02.818
-That he stole from the park?
-Yes, we got a hit.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.613
Chemical analysis showed
it contained powdered milk.

15:05.696 --> 15:06.655
A cutting agent?

15:06.739 --> 15:09.491
Notable because it's a favorite
of the Guayabo cartel.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.660
MPD picked up
one of their dealers last month.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.788
I called to get an evidence sample
to confirm the samples matched.

15:14.872 --> 15:15.998
-But--
-They didn't.

15:16.081 --> 15:19.501
Not only that, the sample we got
from the city wasn't drugs.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.462
It was 100% baking soda.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.797
-MPD seized fake drugs?
-No.

15:23.881 --> 15:26.842
Their paperwork certifies
that the contents of the seizure

15:26.926 --> 15:29.803
was heroin cut with powdered milk
at the time of testing.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.472
Between testing and now,

15:31.555 --> 15:34.183
someone took the drugs
and left baking soda behind.

15:34.266 --> 15:37.895
Between now and then?
Who had access to the drugs in lockup?

15:37.978 --> 15:40.481
Evidence logs show it was never touched.

15:40.564 --> 15:43.359
The case against the cartel
hasn't gone to trial yet.

15:43.442 --> 15:47.571
The drugs were never checked out
of evidence or brought to a courtroom.

15:47.655 --> 15:51.033
So heroin went into lockup,
baking soda came out.

15:51.116 --> 15:54.370
The last person that touched those drugs

15:54.453 --> 15:57.206
would be the drug-lab chemist
who tested them for the city.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.792
-Who's that?
-Name's Tyler Schwartz.

15:59.875 --> 16:02.795
He's been with MPD
for just under five years.

16:02.878 --> 16:04.004
Thank you.

16:04.088 --> 16:06.715
You don't understand how close we came.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.051
-If I hadn't made the tail...
-You did.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.220
...she would have exposed us both.

16:11.762 --> 16:12.972
But she didn't.

16:13.055 --> 16:16.392
I thought this was about
some intercept out of China.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.477
The impending cyberattack.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.895
Are you listening me?

16:19.979 --> 16:24.274
Keenly, in the vain hope of hearing
about this Chinese intercept.

16:24.358 --> 16:27.069
The bureau is following me,

16:27.152 --> 16:29.279
which means they are following you.

16:29.363 --> 16:33.158
This whole thing is about to blow up
and expose us both.

16:33.242 --> 16:37.746
Somehow I don't find your fevered
disposition to be infectious, Andrew.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.207
My fevered-- What is wrong with you?

16:40.290 --> 16:43.919
I am trying to dig us out of this mess.

16:44.003 --> 16:48.173
No, what you are doing is
a rather obvious and ineffectual dance

16:48.257 --> 16:50.759
to cover your tracks.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.262
You killed an innocent man, Andrew.

16:53.929 --> 16:58.517
You faked your death to divert
Harold Cooper, and as a result,

16:58.600 --> 17:00.602
you've only made matters worse.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.896
Now, I told you I'd handle Cooper...

17:02.980 --> 17:04.982
-Are you kidding me?
-...which I will do.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.860
But Harold Cooper is no fool,

17:07.943 --> 17:14.867
and your theatrics only confirm
his belief that he's being played.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.326
So stand back.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.580
-I'll handle this.
-Back up a second.

17:19.663 --> 17:23.208
How about, "Thank you,"
for picking up his tail?

17:23.292 --> 17:27.337
How about, "Thank you,"
for not leading the FBI directly to you

17:27.421 --> 17:32.217
-and thus to Moscow? How about--?
-How about I break your jaw, wire it shut

17:32.301 --> 17:37.431
and force-feed blended cheeseburgers
into your belly until you burst?

17:39.850 --> 17:40.851
How about it?

17:43.228 --> 17:46.523
No? Then shut the hell up and listen.

17:47.649 --> 17:51.945
I told you I would handle Harold Cooper,
and I will do just that.

17:52.029 --> 17:55.866
What you need to do is keep
your mouth shut, your head down

17:55.949 --> 17:59.578
and assure Moscow
that the situation is under control.

17:59.661 --> 18:04.208
Now, please, go away before
this becomes decidedly more uncivil.

18:09.296 --> 18:12.341
The evidence was logged by MPD
and sent to the lab where you work.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.427
-You're the chemist on record.
-I understand that.

18:15.511 --> 18:18.722
Help me understand how evidence
that the police took off the street,

18:18.806 --> 18:23.227
drugs that you tested in your lab,
somehow got swapped with baking soda.

18:23.852 --> 18:25.145
I should wait for my lawyer.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.731
Your lawyer can't stop us
from retesting every sample

18:27.815 --> 18:29.149
you've examined and verified.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.777
When we do, we're gonna find out
they're all fake.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.655
Now, if you help us...

18:36.198 --> 18:37.699
I don't know what to say.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.576
What happened to those drugs?

18:45.874 --> 18:47.000
It's not just me.

18:49.795 --> 18:50.838
It's Williams.

18:52.256 --> 18:53.090
Goebel.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.263
What happens to the drugs, Tyler?

19:00.889 --> 19:03.559
Our facility handles hundreds
of samples every week,

19:03.642 --> 19:05.894
all kinds, from all over the city.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.896
Evidence you personally handle.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.566
Once we run
our chemical analysis to confirm

19:10.649 --> 19:12.025
they're what the police say they are,

19:12.109 --> 19:15.654
the cases go to trial,
supported by the lab certification.

19:15.737 --> 19:18.699
But the drug evidence,
it goes back into the vault.

19:19.575 --> 19:23.203
-Nobody's supposed to test it again.
-You're stealing and reselling evidence.

19:23.287 --> 19:26.957
Like I said, I'm not the only one.
There's an entire network.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.834
With a distribution system.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.796
-I already said too much.
-We know you're using Captain Kidd.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.674
That's who we're after here,
and you're gonna help us find him.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.926
I can't do that.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.220
You can if you wanna help yourself.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.056
Tyler, look at me.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.143
How do we find Captain Kidd?

19:49.980 --> 19:51.982
[suspenseful music playing]

19:58.697 --> 19:59.990
[woman] I've got both online.

20:00.490 --> 20:03.243
[Kidd] Go ahead.
Do I have the buyer on the line?

20:03.327 --> 20:04.995
Yes. We are here.

20:05.078 --> 20:07.247
<i>-Do I have the seller?</i>
-Yes.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.416
Seller, can you confirm
that the transaction is

20:09.499 --> 20:13.045
at least 100 blocks deep
on the blockchain?

20:13.128 --> 20:14.087
I can.

20:14.171 --> 20:17.049
Do I have your consent to release
the package to the buyer?

20:17.132 --> 20:18.300
<i>You do.</i>

20:18.383 --> 20:22.638
Buyer, I'm sending you an encrypted file
with your GPS-tagged identifier.

20:22.721 --> 20:25.307
<i>This will include photos</i>
<i>and verbal instructions</i>

20:25.390 --> 20:27.142
<i>to identify the drop site.</i>

20:27.226 --> 20:30.354
<i>While we wait,</i>
<i>I want to thank you for your patronage.</i>

20:37.361 --> 20:39.821
-We have it.
-[Kidd]<i> Is that your confirmation?</i>

20:39.905 --> 20:40.739
It is.

20:40.822 --> 20:44.493
In that case,
transaction 49r83 is complete.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.371
Again, thank you
for your business and good day.

20:48.038 --> 20:51.083
Tell Penny we're funded,
have her notify Nicosia.

20:51.792 --> 20:54.878
And send someone out for lumpia
and a Mello Yello.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.296
-I could eat a horse.
-[rattling]

20:57.339 --> 20:58.340
What was that?

20:59.675 --> 21:02.469
-I don't hear anything.
-Shh. There. It sounds like--

21:03.262 --> 21:06.139
-FBI. Hands in the air!
-[Aram] On the ground. Now!

21:08.392 --> 21:09.726
Eighty-six the lumpia.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.191
[suspenseful music playing]

21:16.275 --> 21:17.818
Print back yet on Kidd?

21:17.901 --> 21:19.152
Oh, I just got them.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.488
That is, uh... That's the good news.

21:22.072 --> 21:22.990
I'm listening.

21:23.073 --> 21:26.618
Agent Park was following
one of the Rakitin suspects,

21:26.702 --> 21:30.163
Andrew Patterson, from the Office
of Intelligence and Analysis.

21:30.831 --> 21:31.665
Walk with me.

21:32.291 --> 21:36.003
-Park thinks that Patterson made her.
-And the other suspects?

21:36.086 --> 21:40.048
-Nothing on the other three.
-Then we pick it up again tomorrow.

21:40.132 --> 21:43.552
Agent Park doesn't think
that will be necessary.

21:43.635 --> 21:45.887
-Oh? And why is that?
-She thinks

21:45.971 --> 21:48.390
Patterson is Mr. Reddington's source.

21:48.473 --> 21:51.601
Because he gave her the slip?
That proves he's smart, not treasonous.

21:51.685 --> 21:55.564
It's not that. The bad news is
where he gave her the slip.

21:55.647 --> 21:58.108
-Where?
-Corner of Third and North.

21:58.191 --> 22:00.193
Near Mr. Reddington's restaurant.

22:05.782 --> 22:08.035
[Ressler] How we know about you
isn't important.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.619
What matters is that we do.

22:09.703 --> 22:13.457
We know about your geocaching,
how you hide drugs and people.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.292
Safiya Maroun.

22:16.209 --> 22:17.336
Tell me about her.

22:17.961 --> 22:19.087
Never heard of her.

22:20.255 --> 22:23.091
Your prints match to a William Benedict,

22:23.175 --> 22:26.219
tied to a low-rent smuggling operation
back in 2014.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.430
You've come a long way since then, huh?

22:30.098 --> 22:31.099
If you say so.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.269
Safiya Maroun. Where is she?

22:36.313 --> 22:38.023
I haven't the foggiest.

22:38.106 --> 22:41.526
There's a kid in the ICU at County.
He's 13 years old.

22:41.610 --> 22:45.322
He overdosed on the fentanyl
that you stashed in that house.

22:45.405 --> 22:47.324
Now, best-case scenario for you,

22:47.407 --> 22:50.202
I think
that's attempted voluntary manslaughter.

22:50.952 --> 22:53.580
I have no idea what you're talking about.

22:53.663 --> 22:56.083
Your MPD partners have turned on you.

22:56.166 --> 23:01.004
-They've given us sworn affidavits.
-Yet here you are. And we both know why.

23:02.672 --> 23:04.841
-Where is Maroun?
-Where's my deal?

23:04.925 --> 23:08.178
-You wanna get? What are you gonna give?
-[Cooper] Nothing.

23:08.261 --> 23:10.847
A woman's life hangs in the balance.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.975
A heroic woman we are moving
heaven and earth to try and save.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.478
But what I refuse to do...

23:17.270 --> 23:20.023
is to cut a deal with you
to make that happen.

23:21.024 --> 23:23.276
Her blood is on your hands, not mine.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.486
Maybe.

23:24.569 --> 23:27.823
But I can live with that, knowing
that you'll be spending 30 years

23:27.906 --> 23:29.991
taking showers with murderers and rapists.

23:32.661 --> 23:33.995
[door opens]

23:40.001 --> 23:42.254
Okay, so what? We're sweating him now?

23:43.880 --> 23:46.383
No, we're not. We're building a case.

23:46.466 --> 23:49.094
Then it's gonna be prosecuted
to the fullest extent.

23:49.177 --> 23:51.888
He's not gonna tell us
how to find Maroun without a deal.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.181
No, he's not.

23:54.432 --> 23:58.395
But getting played by another criminal,
being forced to look the other way,

23:58.478 --> 24:01.231
to countenance their sickness...

24:01.314 --> 24:04.651
-Isn't that part of the job?
-Yeah. Part I hate the most.

24:05.944 --> 24:08.905
Do what you can to get him to talk.
But he's not getting a deal.

24:12.242 --> 24:15.745
I hear congratulations are in order.
You have Captain Kidd.

24:15.829 --> 24:18.748
-Is that why you're here?
-Time is of the essence.

24:18.832 --> 24:22.669
If Safiya Maroun is ever to draw
a breath of fresh air again,

24:22.752 --> 24:25.463
let me have a chat with the captain.

24:25.547 --> 24:29.259
-Introduce him to Brimley's badger.
-Your concern is noted.

24:29.342 --> 24:32.596
But we both know you didn't come here
just to offer your services.

24:33.638 --> 24:36.224
I came hoping
people would speak the truth.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.894
Captain Kidd. Us.

24:39.936 --> 24:43.148
Given your hypertension,
perhaps we should go first.

24:44.357 --> 24:46.359
[dramatic music playing]

24:52.574 --> 24:54.409
We know about Andrew Patterson.

24:56.661 --> 24:59.289
-Do tell.
-We know he's Rakitin,

24:59.372 --> 25:02.042
your source in the intelligence community.

25:02.125 --> 25:03.418
We suspected as much.

25:03.501 --> 25:06.880
So Park tailed him
to the corner of Third and North.

25:07.505 --> 25:10.550
Lovely neighborhood.
Fine place to go for a walk.

25:10.634 --> 25:11.593
Or for dinner.

25:12.302 --> 25:15.096
It's half a block from your restaurant.

25:16.139 --> 25:17.140

to divulge classified intel.

I'm asking you as a friend,
not an adversary.

25:24.731 --> 25:27.400
I don't have friends
who betray this country.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.990
I understand your quandary.

25:40.163 --> 25:46.211

in her quest to destroy me.

25:47.671 --> 25:51.007
But for what I hope is the final time,

25:51.091 --> 25:52.717
let me be clear.

25:53.718 --> 25:56.846
I am not a traitor to this country,

25:56.930 --> 26:00.350
and I do not divulge
sensitive intelligence

26:00.433 --> 26:02.310

26:02.394 --> 26:05.855

-No, Harold. You think you know.

that you think you can solve.

And as your friend...

26:20.120 --> 26:21.705
and your colleague...

26:22.414 --> 26:25.834
I implore you, for your own sake,

26:26.668 --> 26:28.545

-Sincere advice.

they tend to do unsavory things.

26:38.847 --> 26:42.309

you're not a Russian spy.

26:42.392 --> 26:45.562
And the person Park tailed
isn't supplying you intel.

26:45.645 --> 26:49.607

and yet my life is in danger?

26:50.358 --> 26:52.235

I need to believe you over Elizabeth?

but is gone by morning.

27:06.249 --> 27:07.667

Harold, this...

27:12.339 --> 27:13.340

27:14.341 --> 27:16.634
is between her and me.

27:16.718 --> 27:20.388
She and I may not agree on much,

27:20.472 --> 27:22.599
but I'm sure we agree on this:

27:22.682 --> 27:25.810
Neither of us would be able
to forgive ourselves

27:25.894 --> 27:30.857

to become collateral damage.

I'm glad we've had this talk,
and I appreciate your offer.

what we need from Kidd

27:41.993 --> 27:44.162

-You mean N-13?

28:01.471 --> 28:04.307
So you confronted him about Rakitin,
about how he ditched Park?

28:04.391 --> 28:06.184
I don't condone what Elizabeth's doing.

28:06.267 --> 28:09.771
But if we have to pick sides,
it's past time we picked hers.

28:10.397 --> 28:12.315
We need to get to Keen
before Reddington does.

28:12.399 --> 28:15.652
Because he works for Townsend,
Kidd can help us do that.

No way. I'm not crossing him.

That's just the cost of doing business.

28:45.265 --> 28:47.934
-If I snitch on him, he'll find out.
-So what?

28:48.017 --> 28:51.563
Come on, you'll be drinking mai tais

28:52.439 --> 28:55.191
You can't protect me. Not from him.

38:07.535 --> 38:08.703
No questions asked.

38:10.413 --> 38:12.832
King Fahd is gone, but his oil isn't.

38:13.457 --> 38:16.419
And the royal family has
as much influence as ever.

38:17.169 --> 38:20.464
Safiya Maroun is a threat
to the royal family, so...

38:21.132 --> 38:23.843
Main Justice isn't interested in her
or her statement.

38:24.927 --> 38:27.430
They're only interested
in pretending it never happened.

38:29.432 --> 38:30.766
I have to tell Safiya.

[Dembe] Your fight with Harold is
helping Elizabeth's cause.

38:45.740 --> 38:49.327
And that cause
will only end up hurting her.

38:51.454 --> 38:53.164
I'm not fighting with Harold.

38:53.247 --> 38:57.501
His fight with you, then.
Which you could stop but choose not to.

38:58.878 --> 39:00.880
Go on, then. Give me my medicine.

39:03.466 --> 39:09.388
You gave him the case so you could get
to Captain Kidd and learn about Townsend.

39:09.472 --> 39:14.018
He got to Kidd, but kept him away from you
so he could get to Townsend first.

39:14.602 --> 39:18.606
In the end, Townsend got to Kidd
and neither of you learned anything.

39:19.940 --> 39:22.735
And I thought
taking the pills was unpleasant.

39:24.987 --> 39:26.364
Elizabeth is lost.

39:27.531 --> 39:30.868
She has aligned herself
with a powerful enemy.

39:31.494 --> 39:34.830
You and Harold cannot go on
fighting each other and him.

39:35.581 --> 39:37.208
Find a way to call a truce,

39:37.291 --> 39:39.877
not just for Elizabeth,
but for Harold too.

39:40.753 --> 39:43.130
His list of enemies has grown too long.

39:44.715 --> 39:46.384
Our friend in the East.

What am I not seeing?

40:23.462 --> 40:25.423
We have a system in place.

40:26.590 --> 40:29.051
You are a vital part of that system.

40:29.635 --> 40:34.765
The FBI following you
threatens that system.

40:36.851 --> 40:41.772
Yet he seems unwilling
to do anything to stop them.

40:41.856 --> 40:44.567
[in English] Not unwilling.

Yes. But he is an assistant director

But if he won't do what's necessary

42:03.187 --> 42:07.066
to protect what we've built
over the decades, I will.

42:11.153 --> 42:16.116
Even if it means eliminating
an assistant director of the FBI.
