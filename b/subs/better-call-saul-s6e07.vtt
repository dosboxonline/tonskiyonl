Because the best solutions

mean compromise.

It's compromise from both sides.

31:57.040 --> 32:00.085
Yeah, my PI, Genidowski,

31:57.040 --> 32:00.085

32:00.085 --> 32:02.337
He must have shown me

32:00.085 --> 32:02.337
one set of photos,

32:02.337 --> 32:04.757

Howard...

32:04.757 --> 32:06.592
Three weeks ago,

32:06.592 --> 32:08.968
Julie got a call from

32:06.592 --> 32:08.968
our detective agency.

32:08.968 --> 32:11.054
They wanted to update

32:08.968 --> 32:11.054
their contact info,

32:11.054 --> 32:13.390
so of course, she changed

32:11.054 --> 32:13.390
the number in the system.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.267
But it turns out,

32:13.390 --> 32:15.267
it wasn't them.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.727
That was Jimmy.

32:16.727 --> 32:19.438
So when I needed an investigator

32:16.727 --> 32:19.438
to follow Jimmy,

32:19.438 --> 32:22.691
I called his fake number

32:19.438 --> 32:22.691
and his fake man.

32:22.691 --> 32:24.317
She just dialed

32:22.691 --> 32:24.317
the old number,

32:24.317 --> 32:26.904
and of course

32:24.317 --> 32:26.904
got the actual agency.

32:26.904 --> 32:30.657
And no surprise, no one

32:26.904 --> 32:30.657
by the name of Genidowski

32:30.657 --> 32:32.075
had ever worked there.

32:33.619 --> 32:35.287

32:57.392 --> 32:59.060

32:59.060 --> 33:01.062

33:01.062 --> 33:04.566
He's a profit participant.

33:01.062 --> 33:04.566
This means less money for him.

33:04.566 --> 33:06.192
Because he's a child.

33:06.192 --> 33:07.611
He wants his money now.

33:07.611 --> 33:09.321
He begged me months ago

33:07.611 --> 33:09.321
