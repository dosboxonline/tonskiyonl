00:20.262 --> 00:22.246
Gene, what are you doing?

00:22.264 --> 00:23.505
Why are you opening
the cash register?

00:23.599 --> 00:25.190
-[Gene] Found the pickle!
-[Tina] Dang.

00:25.267 --> 00:26.525
I thought
that was a good hiding spot.

00:26.752 --> 00:28.343
Kids, please don't put a pickle
in the cash register.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.087
I-I shouldn't
have to say that.

00:30.105 --> 00:31.104
Dad, that attitude's not
really in

00:31.198 --> 00:32.589
the spirit of Hide the Pickle.

00:32.682 --> 00:34.424
Do you think maybe
you could play a different game?

00:34.443 --> 00:36.184
Or not play a game
and just help?

00:36.203 --> 00:37.536
Also, maybe you shouldn't call

00:37.763 --> 00:39.096
-the game Hide the Pickle.
-Why?

00:39.114 --> 00:40.280
What's wrong with
Hide the Pickle?

00:40.432 --> 00:42.099
Well, it-- Uh, never mind.

00:42.117 --> 00:43.542
Hey, Sergeant Bosco.

00:43.769 --> 00:45.360
Are we under arrest? Ha-ha.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.862
-Oh, God, are we?
-Not as far as I know.

00:47.882 --> 00:48.955
So, Bob, how's things?

00:49.124 --> 00:50.440
I'm actually doing pretty good.

00:50.534 --> 00:53.034
Listen, Bob, let me
just interrupt your rambling

00:53.054 --> 00:54.369
and cut to the chase here,

00:54.388 --> 00:56.296
I need you to teach me
how to be a burger cook

00:56.448 --> 00:57.781
for an undercover operation.

00:57.800 --> 00:58.891
-[others gasp]
-Uh, what?

00:59.042 --> 01:00.542
You'll be compensated
for your time,

01:00.710 --> 01:02.803
and you and your family will be
anonymous and unconnected

01:02.955 --> 01:04.137
to this investigation
in every way.

01:04.231 --> 01:05.898
-W-Wait...
-Undercover operation?

01:06.125 --> 01:07.382
I'll take this one, Dad.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.476
Yes, Sergeant Bosco, we are
one hundred percent in.

01:09.628 --> 01:12.571
Ooh, undercover.
Who you going after? The mob?

01:12.798 --> 01:13.980
Or a bunch of naughty surfers,

01:14.057 --> 01:15.482
like in that movie
where Keanu Reeves

01:15.634 --> 01:17.242
gets all mad and shoots his gun
up in the air?

01:17.469 --> 01:18.802
He probably killed
a bunch of birds.

01:18.895 --> 01:20.395
Investigating officers
aren't allowed

01:20.414 --> 01:22.581
to divulge details of the case
to citizens who assist

01:22.732 --> 01:23.657
in officer training.

01:23.809 --> 01:24.917
Well, I'm sure you can tell us,

01:25.144 --> 01:27.086
since we're part of
this investigation now.

01:27.237 --> 01:29.313
-N-No, we-we're not.
-You can't back out now.

01:29.406 --> 01:30.647
-We're in too deep
-[Bob] Tina...

01:30.666 --> 01:32.407
If you can't tell us
anything, then,

01:32.484 --> 01:34.668
darn, I think
we might be too busy to help.

01:34.820 --> 01:36.987
Guess you'll have to find
another burger restaurant.

01:37.005 --> 01:38.322
Ugh, bummer.
-

01:38.382 --> 01:39.914
I don't want to have to find
another restaurant.

01:39.934 --> 01:41.934
I already did the paperwork
for this one.

01:42.085 --> 01:44.344
-Yeah...
-[sighs] Okay, fine.

01:44.496 --> 01:46.254
Just don't tell the chief
I told you.

01:46.348 --> 01:47.940
The guy we're going after
is a veteran thief.

01:48.091 --> 01:50.776
Jewelry, uncut gems, art.
And he's got a crew.

01:50.853 --> 01:53.445
They just pulled a job.
I mean, we think it was them.

01:53.597 --> 01:56.598
But we don't have a smoking gun.
That's where you come in, Bob.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.676
This guy, Vincent Bartos,
he's got a burger joint.

01:59.695 --> 02:00.935
-Really?
-It's a front.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.103
Lots of bad guys have fronts.

02:02.272 --> 02:03.622
They launder money through 'em.

02:03.773 --> 02:06.274
Garages that don't fix any cars,
crappy restaurants

02:06.368 --> 02:07.459
that don't have any customers.

02:07.611 --> 02:09.353
-Dad, are we a front?
-Louise.

02:09.371 --> 02:11.279
But get this,
our guy, he's starting

02:11.298 --> 02:13.114
to take his burger place
a little more seriously,

02:13.134 --> 02:14.524
actually trying
to make good food.

02:14.618 --> 02:17.210
-Dad, you should try--
-Yeah, yup, Gene, thank you.

02:17.363 --> 02:19.379
He fired his last line cook
and he's advertising

02:19.473 --> 02:21.548
for a real, legit,
experienced burger cook.

02:21.700 --> 02:23.809
We got a warrant to
send me in undercover.

02:24.036 --> 02:25.144
I have a job interview
in a week.

02:25.371 --> 02:26.478
I don't get it.
You're gonna

02:26.705 --> 02:28.796
make burgers for the guy
until he confesses?

02:28.891 --> 02:30.874
No. We know the restaurant's
a meeting place for his crew.

02:30.893 --> 02:33.968
Anything I overhear while
working there is admissible.

02:34.062 --> 02:35.320
We pull him in, we prosecute.

02:35.472 --> 02:38.548
Oh, and, uh, my undercover
name is Joe Josephs.

02:38.567 --> 02:40.475
That way I only have
to remember the one name.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.219
Um... Is this guy dangerous?

02:42.237 --> 02:43.495
No. I mean, maybe

02:43.647 --> 02:45.389
he's cut off a few fingers
in the past of people

02:45.407 --> 02:47.407
-who have double-crossed him.
-[Bob/Linda] Oh.

02:47.559 --> 02:48.333
As one does.

02:48.485 --> 02:49.893
-Maybe. Unconfirmed.
-Hmm.

02:49.986 --> 02:51.895
Relax, Bob,
it's only dangerous for me.

02:52.064 --> 02:53.914
But if my cover gets blown
and I get killed,

02:54.066 --> 02:55.174
it will be mostly your fault.

02:55.325 --> 02:56.658
For not doing
a good job preparing me.

02:56.677 --> 02:57.509
But no pressure.

02:57.736 --> 02:58.735
-Great.
-Mm...

02:58.828 --> 03:00.179
And to repeat,
you will remain anonymous

03:00.406 --> 03:01.663
and unconnected in any way.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.407
I sent in a fake résumé
with fake references.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.184
And as far as Vincent knows,
I worked at a place

03:05.411 --> 03:07.077
in Long Island
called Grillsville,

03:07.095 --> 03:08.336
which is no longer there.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.579
He called the number
I gave for reference,

03:09.673 --> 03:11.673
and he got my buddy Mack,
who's a cop

03:11.692 --> 03:13.250
and who's amazing at accents.

03:13.268 --> 03:14.768
Wh-What accent did he do?

03:14.920 --> 03:16.177
I don't know.
Italian or something.

03:16.197 --> 03:18.012
-Why Italian?
-'Cause Mack's Italian.

03:18.032 --> 03:19.589
So he's just doing
his normal voice.

03:19.608 --> 03:21.591
I'm just saying,
my backstory's covered.

03:21.685 --> 03:23.368
I just need to learn
how to tie my apron

03:23.595 --> 03:26.187
and twirl a spatula,
or whatever burger guys do.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.689
-Um...
-Come on, Dad.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.357
-[Louise/Tina] Please!
-Please, please, please!

03:29.451 --> 03:31.210
-[kids] Please!
-[Bob sighs]

03:31.361 --> 03:34.213
-Okay, I-I'll teach you.
-[kids] Yay!

03:34.364 --> 03:35.772
How many weapons
do we each get? Ten?

03:35.791 --> 03:39.109
You're gonna need wigs.
Everybody go get their wigs.

03:39.127 --> 03:40.868
[Bob]
Okay, uh, so...

03:40.963 --> 03:42.054
Meat goes on the grill?

03:42.205 --> 03:43.463
Yeah.
[chuckles] Yeah.

03:43.632 --> 03:45.891
I'm just, uh, trying to think
how to teach this.

03:46.042 --> 03:47.300
-Uh, Bob?
-Yeah?

03:47.469 --> 03:48.969
You know everyone knows
how to cook a burger, right?

03:49.045 --> 03:51.121
Everyone has a grill.
Everyone makes burgers.

03:51.139 --> 03:52.622
My neighbor makes burgers
every weekend,

03:52.641 --> 03:54.458
and he is by far
the dumbest guy I've ever--

03:54.476 --> 03:56.460
Yes. I-I know.
Everyone makes burgers.

03:56.553 --> 03:59.238
But in a restaurant,
it's all about consistency.

03:59.465 --> 04:01.240
Can you make a good burger
20 times in a row?

04:01.467 --> 04:02.557
Money-- will people
give it to you?

04:02.576 --> 04:03.967
[Bosco]
Totally. That's great.

04:04.060 --> 04:06.078
Um, are you looking
at men's bathing suits?

04:06.305 --> 04:07.579
Yes. When the new suits
come out,

04:07.731 --> 04:08.747
I like to see what's available.

04:08.898 --> 04:11.065
-I need you to listen.
-Ugh, fine!

04:11.085 --> 04:12.642
Hey, teach me the lingo.
That'll be good.

04:12.661 --> 04:15.254
How do you say, "Cheeseburger,
rare, hold the onion"?

04:15.405 --> 04:17.238
Uh, I mean, just like that?

04:17.316 --> 04:18.832
No, no, you should say
something like,

04:18.984 --> 04:21.593
um, "Burn one, bloody,
yellow blanket, no tears!"

04:21.820 --> 04:24.504
Or, "One brown round,
no crown in the mouth,

04:24.598 --> 04:25.505
then flush it down."

04:25.599 --> 04:26.990
"One hot, single beef boy,

04:27.009 --> 04:28.249
-no wedding ring."
-Kids, come on.

04:28.269 --> 04:29.768
Sometimes I call
French fries spud buddies.

04:29.995 --> 04:32.271
Linda, can you make them
do things out there?

04:32.498 --> 04:33.997
Right, right, right.
Kids, go, work.

04:34.016 --> 04:35.999
-[Gene] Mm.
-Ooh, ooh! What if you say,

04:36.092 --> 04:37.684
"One Patty LaBelle, not so well,

04:37.778 --> 04:39.111
-no smell"?
-Oh, that's good.

04:39.338 --> 04:40.595
Thank you, Lin.
Helpful.

04:41.431 --> 04:43.523
So all of these went on
at different times, right?

04:43.617 --> 04:44.841
We need to keep track
of each one.

04:44.860 --> 04:46.785
When to flip,
when to take it off,

04:47.012 --> 04:48.178
which of them are rare,

04:48.196 --> 04:49.195
-which are med--
-[Bosco] Oh! The nozzle

04:49.348 --> 04:50.605
-of the ice cream maker.
-What?

04:50.624 --> 04:52.273
-[Louise] Nope.
-Sergeant Bosco, you can't play

04:52.293 --> 04:53.517
-Hide the Pickle with my kids.
-What?!

04:53.610 --> 04:55.294
I mean, stop playing that game
with them.

04:55.445 --> 04:57.370
-Louise, stop. We're busy.
-[Louise] Fine!

04:57.464 --> 04:59.523

No. We're a lunch place.

05:16.132 --> 05:18.224
It would be pretty hard
to take a lunch break.

05:18.377 --> 05:19.559

Isn't that the cover name

05:35.243 --> 05:37.336

-Oh, wow. The big show.

05:37.563 --> 05:39.171
You've been training
for this your whole life

05:39.398 --> 05:40.988
for a couple hours today.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.490
You can do it, Sergeant Bosco.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.900
-Maybe.
-Okay.

05:43.919 --> 05:45.993
Uh, first I...

05:46.088 --> 05:47.012
put a patty on the grill?

05:47.163 --> 05:48.421
-Yes.
-Nailing it.

05:48.590 --> 05:50.240
-Where are they again?
-In the-- in the fridge.

05:50.258 --> 05:52.333
The meat's in the fridge.
So, you're gonna...?

05:52.427 --> 05:53.577
Take it out?

05:53.595 --> 05:56.188
-Yes, and...
-Cook it?

05:56.357 --> 05:58.005
Yes, and...

05:58.100 --> 05:59.749
Cook it real good.

05:59.768 --> 06:02.435
-[disappointed groans]
-Season the patty. Right?

06:02.588 --> 06:04.696
When it goes on the grill,
season the patty.

06:04.923 --> 06:06.365
Okay, okay,
you didn't tell me that.

06:06.516 --> 06:08.033
I told you five times.
You weren't listening.

06:08.184 --> 06:09.517
You were playing
Hide the Pickle!

06:09.536 --> 06:10.852
I thought that was part
of the training!

06:10.946 --> 06:12.429
-It should be.
-[sighs]

06:12.522 --> 06:14.447
You said you needed to learn
how to pass as a burger cook!

06:14.541 --> 06:17.117
I told you to teach me
some of the lingo.

06:17.269 --> 06:18.377
Seasoning! There. That's lingo!

06:18.528 --> 06:20.286
It's a super cool
restaurant word.

06:20.439 --> 06:22.122
-"Seasoning."
-That's not cool.

06:22.274 --> 06:24.124
But it can be spicy.
[chuckles] Sorry.

06:24.276 --> 06:26.200
You're not gonna fool anyone.
They'll know you're lying.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.627
They'll know you're a cop.

06:27.779 --> 06:30.130
You're gonna be in danger
and when they have your funeral,

06:30.282 --> 06:31.448
I'm gonna go and tell everyone

06:31.541 --> 06:32.832
that I tried
to teach you how to put

06:32.893 --> 06:35.118
salt on a patty,
but you never listened!

06:35.137 --> 06:36.377
Fine, I quit!

06:36.397 --> 06:38.138

How do you untie this apron?

06:38.232 --> 06:40.123
-Aw...

06:40.292 --> 06:42.901

Oh, oh, hi, Chief.

06:43.128 --> 06:44.719
Really? No.

06:44.796 --> 06:47.072
No, it's fine. Uh, I can do it.

06:47.223 --> 06:48.632
That was the chief.

06:48.650 --> 06:51.743
The job interview got moved up.
It's today at 3:00 p.m.

06:51.895 --> 06:53.412
-What?
-So, uh,

06:53.563 --> 06:55.305
what were you saying
about seasoning?

06:55.323 --> 06:57.140
I was saying
sometimes it's spicy.

06:57.233 --> 06:59.376
Oh, oh, oh, you meant, um...
O-Okay.

07:03.482 --> 07:04.814
The interview's today?
We were supposed to have a week

07:04.833 --> 07:06.073
-to teach you.
-I don't know, Bob,

07:06.168 --> 07:07.500
apparently the guy called

07:07.653 --> 07:09.819
and said we could move up
the interview to today,

07:09.838 --> 07:11.321
and my chief thinks if I say no,

07:11.414 --> 07:13.823
he'll hire someone else,
so I'm going.

07:13.917 --> 07:15.008
He moved the appointment
to today?

07:15.160 --> 07:16.342
What if you have plans?

07:16.495 --> 07:17.585
Yeah, like learning
how to cook a burger

07:17.604 --> 07:19.512
so you can go undercover
as a burger chef.

07:19.665 --> 07:23.108
The chief wants me to go, but,
uh, that still leaves us, um,

07:23.335 --> 07:24.668
ten minutes?
So... teach.

07:24.761 --> 07:27.261
Good, this time.
Are you looking at my hands?

07:27.355 --> 07:28.280
-Um...
-'Cause parts of 'em

07:28.431 --> 07:29.673
might get chopped off, or...?

07:29.691 --> 07:31.283
-The finger parts?
-Is it better to spend

07:31.510 --> 07:33.176
-this time making fake fingers?
-Stop it.

07:33.195 --> 07:35.011
-You're freaking me out.
-Okay, okay.

07:35.030 --> 07:36.362
Uh, oh, God. So, um...

07:36.457 --> 07:38.531
All right, there's not enough
time to make you not bad

07:38.684 --> 07:40.016
at cooking burgers.

07:40.035 --> 07:42.276
I-I think we just need
to teach you how to fake it

07:42.370 --> 07:43.520
so you can get
through this interview.

07:43.613 --> 07:45.112
Then, if you actually
get the job,

07:45.207 --> 07:46.447
we can start trying
to teach you again.

07:46.616 --> 07:48.133
-Bob, ten minutes.
-All right. I guess,

07:48.284 --> 07:50.284
just act like
the old-timers do.

07:50.337 --> 07:51.803
Those guys don't read any blogs.

07:52.030 --> 07:53.305
They don't even like cooking,
I don't think.

07:53.456 --> 07:56.123
So, just say,
"I just do it how I do it.

07:56.218 --> 07:57.550
I don't know
all the fancy words."

07:57.703 --> 07:59.478
I like that!
I don't know how to do it.

07:59.629 --> 08:01.480
I just do it how they...
How you do it!

08:01.556 --> 08:03.707
-What? No.
-But close enough though, right?

08:03.709 --> 08:05.892
Feels right.
I don't know all the words.

08:06.044 --> 08:07.319
I just do it how I do it.

08:07.470 --> 08:08.728
Whoa. I just believed that.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.715
I'm a burger guy, I'm not trying
to make a big blog show.

08:11.733 --> 08:13.992
Ugh. Lost me.
Wait. No. Still works.

08:14.143 --> 08:15.327
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

08:15.478 --> 08:17.144
LINDA:
Bob, you okay?

08:17.164 --> 08:18.330
You've been doing that for...

08:18.557 --> 08:20.314
not<i> too</i> alarming
an amount of time.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.275
Maybe he's finally
getting serious about wiping.

08:22.427 --> 08:23.910
-I'm not there yet.
-Uh, I'm just...

08:24.062 --> 08:25.170
We haven't heard from Bosco,

08:25.397 --> 08:26.913
and I'm very, very,
very nervous about it.

08:27.065 --> 08:28.507
Because of the whole
"if he doesn't seem

08:28.734 --> 08:30.175
"like a real burger chef,
then they'll know he's a cop,

08:30.402 --> 08:31.918
and his fingers
might get chopped off" thing?

08:31.995 --> 08:33.086
-Yes, Tina.
-Got it.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.904
Ugh! This is the<i> not</i> fun part

08:34.906 --> 08:36.573
of undercover work, being

08:36.591 --> 08:38.591
with your even-more-than-usual
stressed-out dad.

08:38.668 --> 08:40.410
I should be
at that thief's restaurant

08:40.503 --> 08:41.928
butterfly-knifing
all over the place.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.555
But instead, I'm here
looking for the pickle,

08:43.782 --> 08:45.690
which is right here!

08:45.842 --> 08:47.600
-Damn.
-I'm sure Bosco is fine, Bob.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.586
Not hearing from him
could be a good thing.

08:49.604 --> 08:51.437
Maybe it's going great, and-and
they're ha-- they're just--

08:51.532 --> 08:53.590
they've just been shaking hands
and nodding

08:53.592 --> 08:54.533
for the last 30 minutes.

08:54.760 --> 08:55.534
-[phone rings]
-[Bob gasps]

08:55.761 --> 08:57.035
-Hello?
-Whoa.

08:57.186 --> 08:59.037
-That's an intense
greeting, Bob.
-Oh. Hey, Teddy.

08:59.264 --> 09:00.780
I-I thought
you were someone else.

09:00.932 --> 09:02.115
Sometimes I do too, Bob.

09:02.191 --> 09:03.357
Anyway, I missed lunch

09:03.377 --> 09:05.101
'cause the job
I'm on is taking forever.

09:05.194 --> 09:06.286
But I'm gonna make it
for an early dinner.

09:06.438 --> 09:07.954
I'm really craving
a burger right now.

09:08.106 --> 09:09.272
I'm getting the shakes,

09:09.291 --> 09:10.715
which is not good
because I'm on a roof.

09:10.867 --> 09:12.199
-Uh-huh.
-I-I just want to make sure

09:12.252 --> 09:13.459
Mort wasn't in my seat.

09:13.612 --> 09:15.202
-What? What?!
-I know it's weird.

09:15.371 --> 09:16.780
I-I mean, I like the guy.

09:16.873 --> 09:19.558
It just bugs me if I'm not there
and Mort's in my seat.

09:19.634 --> 09:21.785
-He's got his own seat.
-Yeah, Mor-Mort's not here,
Teddy.

09:21.803 --> 09:23.210
-Did he tell you to say that?
-No.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.729
No. Teddy, I-I got to go.

09:24.881 --> 09:26.547
Would you just put something on
the seat so no one sits in it?

09:26.567 --> 09:28.382
-Like a menu or a hat?
-Mm. Yup, yup.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.235
-[door bells jingle]
-Hi. Welcome to Bob's Burgers.

09:30.462 --> 09:31.978
-Let me get you a menu.
-Actually, you know what?

09:32.130 --> 09:33.387
I think I know what I'm getting.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.481
I'll have the Burger of the Day.
The, uh,

09:35.576 --> 09:37.984
-Your Swiss Is On My List
burger.
-You got it.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.578
I've been meaning
to try this place for a while.

09:39.729 --> 09:41.246
I'm hearing really good things.

09:41.473 --> 09:44.416
Uh, Bob, you want to stop wiping
and, uh, go do a burger?

09:44.643 --> 09:47.401
Huh? Oh. Sorry. Uh, I'll-I'll
get that started for you.

09:47.495 --> 09:50.071
So, New Burger of the Day
every day, huh?

09:50.090 --> 09:51.405
Oh, uh, yeah.

09:51.499 --> 09:53.149
He doesn't feel the same way
about underpants.

09:53.242 --> 09:54.667
-Louise.
-It's unfortunate.

09:54.820 --> 09:57.095
Well, it's good to challenge
people's expectations, right?

09:57.264 --> 09:59.080
About the burgers,
not the underpants.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.673
Ha. Yeah.
Uh, yeah, thank you.

10:00.826 --> 10:03.009
Ugh! There's nowhere else
to look! Where is it, Louise?

10:03.103 --> 10:04.344
And don't say
it's in your stomach

10:04.438 --> 10:06.012
'cause you two made it
very clear

10:06.164 --> 10:07.439
we weren't allowed
to eat it... anymore.

10:07.666 --> 10:09.608
Sorry about them.
They're playing Hide the Pickle.

10:09.835 --> 10:11.943
It-It's a game where they...
hide-hide a pickle,

10:12.095 --> 10:13.336
and then, they find it.

10:13.355 --> 10:14.946
He knows, Dad.
It's literally in the name.

10:15.098 --> 10:17.282
I'm gonna use the bathroom
real quick, or I can hold it

10:17.433 --> 10:19.284
if, uh, there's a pickle
in there that needs finding?

10:19.511 --> 10:22.528
-We've checked. There isn't.
-[door bells jingle]

10:22.681 --> 10:25.106
-Bob, we have to talk.
-Bosco. You're okay.

10:25.183 --> 10:26.791
You're alive!
Oh, thank God.

10:27.018 --> 10:28.701
Oh, I-I didn't get you killed.
That's so great.

10:28.854 --> 10:31.204
Now our dad can stop
doing his anxious butt clenches.

10:31.373 --> 10:33.857
So, how'd the interview go?
Did you get the job?

10:33.875 --> 10:35.541
You joining
the burger-making nation?

10:35.636 --> 10:38.544
Well, I ju... You may get a call
about someone

10:38.697 --> 10:40.454
who used to work here,
and I-I just need you

10:40.474 --> 10:42.140
to pretend you know
what they're talking about.

10:42.291 --> 10:44.809
Is that Joe?!
What do know?

10:44.961 --> 10:45.977
-Vincent?!
-Huh?

10:46.204 --> 10:47.053
-Vincent?!
-Whoa.

10:47.205 --> 10:47.962
What's going on?

10:48.131 --> 10:50.540
[laughs] Wow, Vincent.

10:50.633 --> 10:52.041
I love that you're here.

10:52.135 --> 10:54.043
This is so good.

10:54.062 --> 10:55.403
Should I go get the wigs?

10:59.660 --> 11:02.568
So, yeah, Bob, this is Vincent.

11:02.663 --> 11:03.995
Vincent, this is Bob.

11:04.147 --> 11:06.498
And Linda.
And their... children.

11:06.649 --> 11:09.668
We're the children that
you saw before, and also now.

11:09.819 --> 11:10.669
-Hello again.
-Hi.

11:10.896 --> 11:12.653
And I'm Joe, which we all know.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.005
Okay, that's enough introducing.

11:14.232 --> 11:16.007
So, Joe, you came by
to visit your old boss?

11:16.234 --> 11:17.750
W-Wait, wh-what?

11:17.844 --> 11:18.902
Yup. Sure did.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.011
Can't keep me away,
can you, Bob?

11:20.163 --> 11:21.829
Uh, y-yeah.

11:21.848 --> 11:22.922
Yeah, look at us.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.331
My old boss
and, hopefully, my new boss.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.758
Don't you two fight over me now.

11:25.911 --> 11:28.836
-[Bosco and Louise laugh]
-[Linda chuckles awkwardly]

11:28.930 --> 11:31.097
Uh, one Burger of the Day,
for-for you.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.249
Thank you, Bob. Looks great.

11:33.268 --> 11:34.434
Oh, hey, Bob, uh...

11:34.528 --> 11:37.253
Will you show me your,
uh, spatula

11:37.255 --> 11:38.679
-that you were talking about?
-What-what?

11:38.773 --> 11:40.681
You know, you know,
the-the cool one, uh,

11:40.701 --> 11:43.034
that you got that you
really wanted to show me.

11:43.261 --> 11:44.277
That one, remember?

11:44.371 --> 11:45.853
Oh, okay.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.447
I kind of want to see
this spatula.

11:47.599 --> 11:49.557
[Bob]
Why is the jewel thief
in my restaurant?

11:49.692 --> 11:51.284
It was going sort of bad.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.119
I said that
"I don't know how to do it,

11:53.271 --> 11:54.212
I just do it" thing you said.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.772
That's not what I said to say.

11:55.790 --> 11:57.382
And then, he was like,
"The place you used to work

11:57.533 --> 11:58.717
"isn't around anymore.

11:58.868 --> 12:00.610
-Did you work anywhere else?"
-So you said here?

12:00.628 --> 12:03.054
Yes, and he really liked that.
He-He's heard of you.

12:03.281 --> 12:04.614
So, do you think he's on to us?

12:04.632 --> 12:06.373
Just... [stammers] I'm not sure.
Maybe he just decided

12:06.393 --> 12:08.618
he had to eat at Bob's Burgers
right away, right?

12:08.620 --> 12:09.802
Or he thinks I'm a cop

12:09.955 --> 12:11.120
and you're the guy
who helped the cop,

12:11.214 --> 12:12.379
and he's here to feel it out

12:12.399 --> 12:13.973
and maybe kill both of us.
It's hard to know.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.625
-Oh, my God.
-Bob, just keep it
together, Bob.

12:15.718 --> 12:16.735
We just got to keep it together.

12:16.962 --> 12:18.478
Oh, like how you
blurted out the name

12:18.630 --> 12:20.797
of my restaurant
at your interview, Joe Josephs?

12:20.815 --> 12:23.107
You see? This is why
I couldn't work here anymore.

12:23.334 --> 12:24.968
You never supported me.

12:24.986 --> 12:26.803
Uh, great spatula, Bob.

12:26.896 --> 12:28.413
So glad we went
to go look at it.

12:28.582 --> 12:31.157
I'm gonna seriously consider
getting that one for myself.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.642
Yeah. Y-You should get one.

12:32.660 --> 12:34.660
-Then you can flip
each other off.
-Gene.

12:34.813 --> 12:36.570
Uh, so, uh, h-how's the burger?

12:36.664 --> 12:38.590
It's amazing. You are an artist.

12:38.666 --> 12:39.758
Oh, uh, thank you.

12:39.985 --> 12:43.428
Uh, that's, uh,
how I taught Joe, also, too.

12:43.655 --> 12:45.171
To-to be that-that way.

12:45.323 --> 12:48.007
Ha. Yeah. I just do...

12:48.159 --> 12:48.992
what you do. How you do it.

12:49.160 --> 12:50.493
-Yup.
-Yup.

12:50.512 --> 12:52.437
Uh, Tina, Gene, Louise,
how-how would you like to go

12:52.514 --> 12:54.013
play your Hide the Pickle
game upstairs?

12:54.165 --> 12:55.348
Doesn't that sound fun?

12:55.500 --> 12:57.183
Dad, the pickle
is still hidden down here.

12:57.335 --> 12:58.443
Uh-huh, sure, uh,

12:58.612 --> 13:00.186
but maybe you could just use
a different pickle

13:00.263 --> 13:01.613
that's in the upstairs fridge?

13:01.782 --> 13:02.781
Y-Yeah, yeah.

13:02.932 --> 13:04.507
-Whoa.
-[gasps]
-A different pickle?

13:04.526 --> 13:05.691
Do you hear yourself right now?

13:05.844 --> 13:08.027
-Yeah, seriously, Bob?
-So, Joe,

13:08.121 --> 13:09.954
visiting the old
stomping grounds, huh?

13:10.106 --> 13:11.772
Oh, yeah, visiting
the place that I worked in.

13:11.866 --> 13:14.459
And, uh, there was that spatula
question I had for Bob.

13:14.686 --> 13:16.127
-You know, chef stuff.
-[Gene] Spat chat.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.945
-[door bells jingle]
-Oh, no.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.039
-Hey. Teddy.
-Hey, Teddy.
-[Louise gasps]

13:20.208 --> 13:21.207
Teddy knows Bosco.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.542
-He'll ruin everything.
-Oh, no.

13:22.694 --> 13:25.545
I-I... Remember,
I told you guys to put a menu

13:25.639 --> 13:27.547
or a hat on my stool?
Bob, what happened?

13:27.699 --> 13:29.140
Putting a man there
is not saving it.

13:29.292 --> 13:30.533
Every other seat is empty.

13:30.552 --> 13:32.293
What happened?
Nothing against you, sir.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.370
Uh, nothing against...
You seem fine, but...

13:34.463 --> 13:35.963
One Burger of the Day,
please, Bob.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.148
Uh, to-go, though, right?

13:37.375 --> 13:38.316
Right. Wait, what?

13:38.543 --> 13:40.376
Uh, you're-you're getting
this to-go.

13:40.469 --> 13:42.970
You called earlier
and you said you'd swing by

13:43.064 --> 13:44.805
and pick up a burger to-go.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.382
I did? I don't remember
doing that.

make it right now.

you should chat with Teddy.

he want, uh, wants to chat.

-I don't know.

They're not new,
but there's something new.

-Oh, yeah, there's a swagger.

This one's on the house

thinking about hiring Joe, here.

a pretty penny for those.

than a bad scuff job.

but you only have two customers.

14:41.715 --> 14:44.865
-Three.
-Well, he's not a customer,
of course, Teddy.

Where's the salt and pepper?

16:11.454 --> 16:14.363
-Above the grill
with the spices.
-Salt is a spice?

Uh, in case he breaks it.
Yeah, you know chefs, so clumsy.

16:23.891 --> 16:26.542

The to-go burger.
