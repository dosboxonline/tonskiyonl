02:03.044 --> 02:04.295
Moving on up.

02:04.879 --> 02:06.130
Believe that!

02:08.674 --> 02:10.509
Ladies, we got picture.

02:10.717 --> 02:11.594
What about the alarm?

02:11.802 --> 02:13.804
Miles, what do you think I'm doing?

02:14.013 --> 02:17.016
Just cool out. We like to run
a loose crew around here.

02:17.433 --> 02:18.643
You're the boss, Miles.

02:18.851 --> 02:20.061
It's like that?

02:20.269 --> 02:21.479
It's like that.

02:21.979 --> 02:24.690
I'm gonna go check on Tulley.

02:36.285 --> 02:38.829
<i>Tulley, we cool down there?</i>

02:40.665 --> 02:42.250
Yeah, we're cool, man.

02:42.542 --> 02:43.376
<i>Good. </i>

02:43.793 --> 02:45.253
Cool is good.

02:45.753 --> 02:46.796
Are you smoking?

02:47.255 --> 02:48.714
No. Negative.

02:49.090 --> 02:49.924
<i>You're lying!</i>

02:50.132 --> 02:52.218
I smell the menthol up here, man!

02:52.635 --> 02:56.138
What would your mama do
if she knew you were smoking?

02:56.347 --> 02:58.015
<i>Cut it out, man!</i>

03:00.852 --> 03:01.936
Stay alert.

03:02.895 --> 03:04.313
You ready over here?

03:09.986 --> 03:12.613
Damn it! Eddie, why you
gotta do that every time?

03:12.822 --> 03:13.656
It's good luck.

03:13.906 --> 03:16.784
It's bad luck if I land in it.
Believe that.

03:16.993 --> 03:18.619
Don't fall in that shit.

03:19.412 --> 03:20.246
See you, Deke.

03:21.038 --> 03:22.373
Good luck, guys.

03:55.031 --> 03:56.574
<i>How's the weather up there?</i>

03:56.782 --> 03:57.909
Snowing.

03:58.367 --> 04:01.412
It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas.

04:31.108 --> 04:32.985
You got a guard 20 feet from you.

04:39.575 --> 04:41.160
Ten feet.
He's closing in fast.

04:42.453 --> 04:43.579
Around the corner.

05:24.203 --> 05:25.496
<i>He turned around. </i>

05:27.915 --> 05:29.041
Forget it. He's gone.

05:30.918 --> 05:33.087
So much for the easy part. Kit.

05:34.714 --> 05:36.966
- Shit!
- Bam!

05:37.216 --> 05:38.467
I hate it when you do that.

05:38.843 --> 05:40.094
Eddie, check this out.

05:40.303 --> 05:43.055
This is a Brigger 3300.
Toughest safe in the world.

05:43.347 --> 05:45.057
- What do you do?
- Drill the lock.

05:45.349 --> 05:47.768
No, you gotta check
to see if it's open.

05:48.644 --> 05:49.645
It's open!

05:50.646 --> 05:51.480
What?

05:52.106 --> 05:55.151
No, I'm messing with you.
They would never do that.

05:55.359 --> 05:57.195
They would never do that.

06:28.935 --> 06:30.019
Glasses.

06:35.775 --> 06:38.027
- I'll see you back up top.
- Right.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.020
Open sesame.

07:15.648 --> 07:16.691
Come on, Eddie.

07:17.525 --> 07:18.359
Got the rock?

07:18.568 --> 07:19.986
Miles is right behind me.

07:24.365 --> 07:25.616
What the hell you doing?

07:25.825 --> 07:27.869
Seventeen million four ways?

07:28.327 --> 07:29.871
I'm too greedy for that.

07:30.079 --> 07:31.164
No, just come on, man!

07:41.757 --> 07:42.592
Shit!

07:58.941 --> 08:00.776
Come here, gorgeous.

08:03.654 --> 08:05.907
Got the rock. Time to roll.

08:06.115 --> 08:07.408
<i>Hurry! There's lots... </i>

08:07.617 --> 08:09.368
...of activity here. Let's go!

08:09.577 --> 08:10.453
Shit!

08:38.898 --> 08:39.899
Freeze!

08:48.115 --> 08:48.991
Clear!

08:52.119 --> 08:53.287
Let's go!

08:53.496 --> 08:56.749
- Stay down! Don't move!
- Let me see your hands!

08:58.668 --> 09:00.545
- Where's Eddie?
- He went over already.

09:00.753 --> 09:01.963
- You have the rock?
- What?

09:02.171 --> 09:03.130
You got the rock?

09:03.422 --> 09:04.924
- What you doing?
- Give me the rock!

09:05.132 --> 09:06.926
You ain't got to do this!

09:07.134 --> 09:10.763
We're supposed to split this shit, man!
Why you doing this?

09:44.380 --> 09:45.298
Shit!

10:02.190 --> 10:04.317
Miles, you're dead,
you piece of shit!

11:11.050 --> 11:12.051
Damn!

11:44.584 --> 11:45.835
Good doggie!

11:46.127 --> 11:47.545
Good doggie!

11:47.753 --> 11:48.713
Kibbles 'n Bits!

11:48.921 --> 11:49.922
Easy.

11:50.506 --> 11:52.175
Where's the nearest exit?

11:52.884 --> 11:54.218
Stay where you are!

11:54.552 --> 11:55.511
Turn around!

11:55.761 --> 11:58.848
I'm a carpenter! I was working late!

12:00.224 --> 12:03.436
See? That's the saw!
See? I was working!

12:03.644 --> 12:06.355
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

12:06.564 --> 12:09.483
Anything you say can and will
be used against you.

12:09.692 --> 12:13.362
If you can't afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you.

12:13.571 --> 12:15.031
Do you understand your rights?

12:16.949 --> 12:18.993
Yeah, I understand them.

12:53.569 --> 12:55.238
Ain't nothing but a free thing, baby!

12:57.823 --> 12:59.700
Free man. Believe that.

13:00.743 --> 13:02.245
One belt, one shoelace...

13:02.453 --> 13:04.539
...one wallet containing $22.

13:04.831 --> 13:06.165
One shoelace?

13:06.499 --> 13:09.544
You know how much them shoes cost?
One shoelace?

13:09.752 --> 13:11.587
I came in here with two.

13:12.463 --> 13:15.424
You took my shoelace?
Did you take my shoelace, man?

13:16.300 --> 13:18.845
You got two seconds
to walk out that door.

13:19.095 --> 13:20.054
Sign out...

13:20.263 --> 13:21.889
...and leave my pen.

13:23.391 --> 13:24.642
I'm signing out.

13:24.976 --> 13:27.353
I got places to go, people to see.

13:27.645 --> 13:29.355
My lady, Janiece.

13:29.689 --> 13:30.940
Ass...

13:32.275 --> 13:33.484
It's like that.

13:33.693 --> 13:37.446
What you gonna do with one shoelace?
Let me in on the secret.

13:37.822 --> 13:39.532
Floss your ass?

13:40.199 --> 13:41.367
Gotta go.

13:44.620 --> 13:47.373
Y'all stay up, man.
Don't be mad because I gotta go.

13:47.665 --> 13:51.294
Come on, open this fence.
Thanks. I'm out of here.

13:53.337 --> 13:56.257
Where them butt-naked hoes at?
Do you know?

13:57.175 --> 13:58.634
Let me up out of here.

14:02.305 --> 14:04.891
I'm free! I'm free at last!

14:05.558 --> 14:06.392
Gotta go!

14:06.601 --> 14:08.019
Gotta go, gotta go!

14:10.188 --> 14:11.522
I'm out of here!

14:35.171 --> 14:36.422
Damn!

14:36.631 --> 14:38.257
What happened?

14:39.008 --> 14:41.135
Did you eat the whole time
I was in there?

14:41.344 --> 14:44.180
When I left, you was
like plickety-cow, plickety-pat.

14:44.555 --> 14:46.224
Now, you're like va-voom!

14:46.432 --> 14:49.560
Wait a minute. That's all right.
I can adjust.

14:49.769 --> 14:53.481
It's the love that counts.
I can adjust to a plus-size woman.

14:53.689 --> 14:56.651
Just more cushion for the pushin'!

14:57.151 --> 14:58.486
Janiece!

14:58.819 --> 15:01.364
Your sad-ass sack of bones is here.

15:02.156 --> 15:04.575
I apologize. You're her cousin!

15:05.201 --> 15:06.494
Can I buy you some cereal?

15:06.744 --> 15:08.120
It's okay, Shawna.

15:08.746 --> 15:12.083
There you are. Just hot!

15:15.086 --> 15:17.129
Baby, you are...

15:18.130 --> 15:19.465
You look beautiful.

15:19.882 --> 15:23.803
You are beautiful. And that's
not two years of prison talking.

15:24.011 --> 15:26.722
Baby, it must've been hard
in there for you.

15:26.973 --> 15:30.309
All alone at night in your little cot.

15:30.643 --> 15:32.228
Tell me something, Miles.

15:33.145 --> 15:34.772
Did you think about me?

15:35.940 --> 15:37.984
Think about you all the time.

15:38.317 --> 15:40.361
Think about you right now.

15:40.945 --> 15:44.490
Then you should've thought about that
before you robbed people!

15:46.367 --> 15:48.202
I never robbed you!

15:50.121 --> 15:51.956
I'm a rehabilitated man!

15:56.794 --> 15:58.004
Talk to me!

15:58.462 --> 16:01.382
I didn't come see you for two years.
Wasn't that a sign?

16:02.091 --> 16:04.218
You couldn't stand
to see your man like that.

16:04.594 --> 16:05.469
Man?

16:05.678 --> 16:09.682
You're not my man. You lie.
You told me you were a banker.

16:09.932 --> 16:12.518
Bank robber. Yeah, see,
sometime I stutter.

16:12.727 --> 16:15.730
But I'm getting that whole
speech impediment thing...

16:16.272 --> 16:20.985
You are a very smart man, but the entire
time we spent together was one big lie.

16:21.485 --> 16:24.071
Look, Janiece. Listen to me, okay?

16:24.614 --> 16:27.283
I know I lied about some things,
but I can change.

16:27.491 --> 16:28.618
I don't think so.

16:28.868 --> 16:29.702
Bye!

16:29.911 --> 16:32.455
Don't do me like this!

16:49.764 --> 16:51.599
Fifth and Grand?

17:07.281 --> 17:09.742
How you doing?
Is this really a police station?

17:09.992 --> 17:11.327
Of course.

17:51.409 --> 17:53.911
Hi. I have a delivery for Traffic.

17:55.037 --> 17:56.330
Sign by the "X."

17:58.791 --> 18:03.004
What have we got?
Egg roll, orange chicken...

18:03.421 --> 18:05.256
Hot pizza coming through. Hot pizza!

18:05.548 --> 18:07.592
Got to get the officers
their pizza.

18:07.842 --> 18:11.762
They got to protect and serve.
The police got to eat too!

18:12.013 --> 18:13.514
Let the officers eat, please.

18:13.764 --> 18:17.143
I'm the pizza man here
to deliver the pizza. Thank you.

18:17.351 --> 18:19.270
Officers, I got your pizzas!

18:20.897 --> 18:24.150
"Third Floor: Robbery-Homicide. "

18:26.652 --> 18:29.030
Yeah, please be careful.
Pizza's very hot.

18:29.238 --> 18:32.950
Don't want nobody to get hurt.
Just got here some pizza for you.

18:33.159 --> 18:35.995
Pizza for you. That's how we do it
down at the pizza place.

18:36.621 --> 18:38.664
Watch it, watch it, watch it!

18:39.749 --> 18:43.002
Two time, bring it up!
Don't drop the pizza!

18:49.258 --> 18:51.636
Pizza delivery for Robbery-Homicide.

18:52.136 --> 18:54.013
Robbery-Homicide?

18:54.555 --> 18:57.099
Why is it I don't see
Robbery-Homicide...

18:57.308 --> 18:59.560
...with a pizza delivery
in the log-in sheet?

18:59.810 --> 19:03.231
I'll tell you what. Why don't you
leave that pizza with me?

19:03.439 --> 19:06.692
No, I'll tell you what.
Last time I left a pizza here...

19:06.901 --> 19:08.611
...it magically disappeared.

19:08.861 --> 19:11.614
I mean, it's just like
leaving candy around me.

19:11.864 --> 19:15.576
It's not gonna be all right.
I'm gonna chomp it up. See?

19:15.952 --> 19:18.162
Two kinds of people
get through that door:

19:18.412 --> 19:21.040
People wearing handcuffs.
People wearing a badge.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.000
You don't have on either.

19:24.627 --> 19:27.922
Well, I don't have
a badge or handcuffs, so...

19:28.172 --> 19:29.090
Officer Carlson.

19:29.465 --> 19:33.386
- We wanna flip that card right over.
- Sorry. Just got it.

19:34.011 --> 19:35.429
Excuse me, officer.

19:36.973 --> 19:40.601
The guys in Homicide ordered this pizza
about an hour ago.

19:42.854 --> 19:45.481
I don't wanna leave them
with Shamu over there.

19:47.316 --> 19:48.734
What do you want me to do?

19:48.943 --> 19:49.777
Take them!

19:49.986 --> 19:52.363
- I'm on duty. I can't do that.
- Yes, you can!

19:52.572 --> 19:54.448
Please take that!

19:56.325 --> 19:57.994
Thank you very much!

20:01.247 --> 20:02.874
Break it down.

20:05.376 --> 20:06.961
Two time, left!

20:07.211 --> 20:09.380
One time! Break it down to the ground!

20:09.755 --> 20:10.715
Go here!

20:10.923 --> 20:13.259
Left leg! Bring it around!

20:14.969 --> 20:16.387
Walk!

20:23.978 --> 20:26.022
You hid a diamond
in the police station?

20:26.230 --> 20:29.734
I didn't know it was a police station.
Can you change the I.D. Or not?

20:29.942 --> 20:34.155
Sure, but won't they be suspicious of
a pizza man with a security clearance?

20:34.363 --> 20:36.490
I'm not going back as a pizza man.

20:36.741 --> 20:37.867
What are you going as?

20:38.075 --> 20:38.951
A cop.

20:39.202 --> 20:40.203
A cop?

20:40.536 --> 20:41.496
A new transfer.

20:41.704 --> 20:45.333
That's why I need that I.D.
And a new file for detective.

20:45.958 --> 20:47.001
Why a detective?

20:47.210 --> 20:49.086
That's where the rock is.

20:51.964 --> 20:53.549
It's gonna be expensive.

20:54.383 --> 20:56.886
Uncle Lou, I thought we was like family.

20:57.136 --> 20:59.805
Yeah, well, "like family" is not family.

21:00.014 --> 21:03.392
If you were family,
you'd want it for free, right?

21:05.019 --> 21:07.855
Well, you ain't changed.
I'll see you later.

21:20.201 --> 21:21.494
Get down!

21:21.702 --> 21:24.121
Put some clothes on!
Get your butt-naked ass down!

21:24.372 --> 21:26.165
Get your butt-naked ass down!

21:26.374 --> 21:29.752
He's naked and he's stinking.
Somebody get him some clothes.

21:30.002 --> 21:31.754
He's hiding a gun in his ass!

21:34.215 --> 21:36.384
Get on the ground. Do it now.

21:36.634 --> 21:37.718
Don't I know you?

21:38.803 --> 21:39.720
Freeze!

21:39.929 --> 21:40.763
Cuff him!

21:40.972 --> 21:42.640
Yeah, cuff his ass.

21:42.849 --> 21:44.767
I'm gonna cuff you like that.

21:45.017 --> 21:48.145
I'm the good cop.
You act up, I'll turn into the bad one.

21:53.860 --> 21:55.528
Freeze! Get them up!

21:55.736 --> 21:57.363
Spread your legs now.

21:57.697 --> 21:59.991
I'm an officer of the law.

22:03.161 --> 22:04.370
Any sign of Deacon?

22:04.662 --> 22:07.832
Last I heard, he was pulling
rip jobs in Carson.

22:09.125 --> 22:11.836
- I warned you about that guy.
- That you did.

22:12.044 --> 22:14.130
He'll know you're out.

22:15.339 --> 22:17.550
This is purely cosmetic.
It won't check out.

22:17.758 --> 22:21.429
Don't worry. I'll be out of there
in an hour, max. Thanks.

22:21.679 --> 22:22.513
Good luck.

22:39.572 --> 22:42.116
Hey there, officer dog.

22:42.575 --> 22:43.451
I'm a detective.

22:43.659 --> 22:44.660
Sorry, sir.

22:44.911 --> 22:46.037
She's never done that.

22:46.746 --> 22:48.539
Must be the pastrami.

22:48.956 --> 22:49.832
Bitch!

22:58.049 --> 22:59.008
Are you going up?

23:01.594 --> 23:02.845
Up. Third floor.

23:04.931 --> 23:06.516
Appreciate it.

23:21.531 --> 23:22.365
What?

23:22.990 --> 23:23.908
What?

23:49.433 --> 23:53.229
The vehicle belonged to your friend,
but you don't remember his name?

23:54.105 --> 23:55.481
Do you have a last name?

23:56.190 --> 23:58.651
Damn, these cuffs are tight, man!

24:00.152 --> 24:03.239
Miss Green, could you tell
this man to loosen these cuffs?

24:11.998 --> 24:14.333
I can't feel my fingers, man.
I'm serious. Please?

24:14.542 --> 24:16.252
- I know it.
- Detective.

24:16.836 --> 24:18.296
Not so tight.

24:19.547 --> 24:21.507
Maybe I could loosen them up a bit.

24:37.732 --> 24:40.818
You got a great lawyer there.
Top of the line. Here you go.

25:00.421 --> 25:01.589
He's in here!

25:05.426 --> 25:06.469
Jesus!

25:07.428 --> 25:08.471
How y'all doing?

25:09.096 --> 25:10.640
Not again, Carlson!

25:10.848 --> 25:12.517
The guy body-slammed me, sir.

25:12.767 --> 25:13.809
Maybe he likes you.

25:14.018 --> 25:15.186
He did what to you?

25:15.436 --> 25:19.190
Get him out of here! What were
you thinking? Man, that's not smart!

25:19.524 --> 25:20.858
Get him out of here.

25:23.569 --> 25:25.196
What the hell happened up there?

25:26.197 --> 25:27.365
Up here?

25:28.658 --> 25:30.993
I caught him trying to escape.

25:31.869 --> 25:33.329
Who the hell are you?

25:34.831 --> 25:37.041
Malone. Just transferred.
Right there.

25:37.250 --> 25:39.210
Yeah, check that out. Bam!

25:39.418 --> 25:40.628
- You know Malone?
- No.

25:40.837 --> 25:42.338
Nobody told me about it.

25:43.714 --> 25:44.924
Guys...

25:46.717 --> 25:47.593
Sorry, ma'am.

25:47.885 --> 25:49.595
Excuse me.

25:51.305 --> 25:53.224
Let me flush, please.

25:56.686 --> 26:00.231
I didn't know.
You might not wanna go in there.

26:02.525 --> 26:05.027
You got some paperwork for me, Malone?

26:06.153 --> 26:09.157
We've been requesting
a new detective for 8 months.

26:09.365 --> 26:13.452
Suddenly, you just turn up.
I'll never understand the system.

26:14.495 --> 26:17.957
Burglary? Sixteen citations,
mayor's commendation.

26:18.624 --> 26:20.877
You worked out of West Covina?

26:21.252 --> 26:23.212
Well, that's what it says right there.

26:23.963 --> 26:26.632
You look familiar, Malone.
Have we met before?

26:30.094 --> 26:32.972
You wouldn't happen to be
in a bowling league, would you?

26:35.141 --> 26:37.685
That's it. You're a bowler.

26:37.935 --> 26:38.769
I try.

26:38.978 --> 26:40.730
We could use a guy in Burglary.

26:42.732 --> 26:44.066
Right here.

26:44.317 --> 26:48.821
I thought I was gonna be assigned
to a desk. Right up in here!

26:49.030 --> 26:50.156
Are you kidding me?

26:50.364 --> 26:53.493
A guy like you?
No, you belong on the street.

26:54.035 --> 26:55.036
And also, listen.

26:55.244 --> 26:59.081
Carlson needs a partner with some
experience. He just got promoted.

26:59.582 --> 27:01.083
Chief, I just got a call.

27:01.292 --> 27:03.920
Malone's gonna join us.
Show him around.

27:05.713 --> 27:08.257
And let Malone do
all the handcuffing, okay?

27:09.842 --> 27:11.260
I appreciate that, yeah.

27:11.844 --> 27:12.720
I'll review these.

27:15.723 --> 27:18.267
This is the bullpen here.
That's Booking up there.

27:18.476 --> 27:21.562
The holding cells are down that way.
You wanna see them?

27:21.854 --> 27:23.856
Seen one, seen them all.

27:24.398 --> 27:25.816
This is my desk here, sir.

27:26.025 --> 27:27.401
Nice desk.

27:27.610 --> 27:29.779
Thanks. Let's see...

27:30.363 --> 27:31.489
Brass is on five.

27:31.697 --> 27:33.032
Robbery-Homicide on three.

27:33.241 --> 27:35.284
Over there, that's the tag and bag.

27:36.619 --> 27:39.288
- Through those doors, that's 10-17.
- Roger.

27:40.665 --> 27:41.999
Show him the rest later.

27:42.208 --> 27:43.793
- Come on.
- Where?

27:44.043 --> 27:46.796
We got a call. Burglary.
It's ours. I'll take this.

27:47.004 --> 27:47.839
Outside?

27:48.047 --> 27:49.715
That's where all the crime is.

27:49.924 --> 27:52.093
I just got here,
and that's not a good thing.

27:52.343 --> 27:55.805
I gotta do work in here so that
I know what's going on out there.

27:56.013 --> 27:57.640
I might need backup, right?

28:00.226 --> 28:01.936
How long you been in Burglary?

28:02.186 --> 28:04.814
Me? All my life, man, all my life.

28:05.022 --> 28:10.152
I heard the chief say that you got 16
citations. That's incredible! Sixteen!

28:10.444 --> 28:13.698
That's what happens when
your Uncle Lou writes your file.

28:16.868 --> 28:19.328
You can ride up front if you want.

28:21.038 --> 28:22.290
I knew that.

28:22.707 --> 28:26.252
You just gotta be real careful
for the pedestrians coming out here.

28:26.502 --> 28:28.129
Walking around out here.

28:29.005 --> 28:32.466
Am I clear to the right?
Am I clear? Have I got it?

28:35.469 --> 28:36.762
I just made detective.

28:36.971 --> 28:38.097
No kidding.

28:39.432 --> 28:42.977
I worked Traffic for three years.
I got pretty good at it.

28:45.813 --> 28:50.484
You don't have to stop for the yellow.
You could just drive right through.

28:50.693 --> 28:55.656
Sir, not if you'd seen some
of the accidents I've seen. No thanks.

28:56.449 --> 28:58.743
Well, there's your green right there.

29:02.663 --> 29:04.290
Can I ask you a personal question?

29:04.499 --> 29:06.209
Yeah, sure.

29:06.876 --> 29:08.794
How many times did you take the test?

29:10.087 --> 29:11.005
What test?

29:11.214 --> 29:13.966
You know, the test for detective.

29:14.509 --> 29:15.635
That one!

29:15.927 --> 29:17.303
- One time.
- Really?

29:17.762 --> 29:19.180
Aced it.

29:20.056 --> 29:21.516
Took it out.

29:21.724 --> 29:23.976
Took me five tries.

29:24.477 --> 29:28.481
I did well on the written part, but
my performance reviews weren't so hot.

29:28.689 --> 29:32.360
How many times did it take you
to get your driver's license, man?

29:32.568 --> 29:35.321
Please! Wake me up when we get there.

29:35.530 --> 29:37.281
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

29:37.490 --> 29:39.408
Goodness, man!

29:40.493 --> 29:42.829
It's a nice suit, sir.
It's really cool.

29:43.037 --> 29:44.705
Well, I appreciate it.

29:44.914 --> 29:46.874
Yeah, you know? Appreciate it.

29:47.166 --> 29:48.000
Got any music?

29:48.209 --> 29:49.794
Oh, yeah. Sure.

29:50.753 --> 29:52.088
I like to jam.

29:52.296 --> 29:55.007
Just so long as
we can hear the dispatcher.

29:56.425 --> 29:57.802
That's good.

29:58.594 --> 30:02.557
- I never heard this station before.
- Kind of funky. You like that?

30:14.235 --> 30:17.697
Last night these shelves were loaded
with Elites. Now they're gone.

30:18.072 --> 30:19.574
Three dozen gorgeous rims.

30:19.824 --> 30:21.367
They didn't take anything else?

30:21.576 --> 30:25.705
They went for my good stuff. Chrome
with gold trim. Five grand worth.

30:26.706 --> 30:27.832
What about the alarm?

30:28.040 --> 30:29.917
What about it? It went off.

30:30.126 --> 30:32.253
But it took you guys
two hours to get here.

30:32.461 --> 30:34.672
My wheels are probably
in Tijuana by now.

30:34.881 --> 30:36.424
Here's where they came in.

30:37.758 --> 30:42.263
Looks like they broke the glass, opened
the handle, crawled in the window.

30:42.513 --> 30:43.556
Exactly.

30:43.764 --> 30:45.683
Shimmied down the shelf or something.

30:45.892 --> 30:47.101
This is a waste of time.

30:47.310 --> 30:48.978
That's not how they got in.

30:49.478 --> 30:50.730
Of course it is.

30:51.063 --> 30:53.065
Cut it out.
That's not how they got in.

30:53.316 --> 30:54.442
This is the spot here.

30:54.650 --> 30:56.485
That's how I would've came in.

30:57.153 --> 30:58.946
If I was a thief.

30:59.197 --> 31:00.948
If I was a thief!

31:01.157 --> 31:04.118
Skylight. Just cut the alarm
from the inside.

31:04.327 --> 31:06.120
I could take my time.

31:06.329 --> 31:07.330
Why take your time?

31:07.872 --> 31:09.415
Why would I take my time?

31:14.212 --> 31:15.546
It's heavy.

31:16.464 --> 31:17.965
Now, you tell me.

31:18.174 --> 31:22.929
How long would it take to carry 3 dozen
of those out and load them in a truck?

31:23.137 --> 31:25.932
- Long time.
- It would take a very long time.

31:26.140 --> 31:29.602
But they probably had three
or four guys working the damn thing...

31:29.810 --> 31:32.146
Zip! Zip the shit up! Frank, hush.

31:32.480 --> 31:34.690
Because you know better. Come on.

31:34.899 --> 31:38.778
Don't lie to me. I'm the man.
I'm the man, Frank.

31:39.028 --> 31:40.404
You're the man.

31:40.988 --> 31:45.493
Your 5000, sorry to tell you,
is worth less than two on the street.

31:45.743 --> 31:49.080
Which don't go four ways
with much juice once you rent a truck.

31:49.705 --> 31:53.376
And to rent a truck, that requires what?

31:54.210 --> 31:55.670
Credit card...

31:56.379 --> 31:58.506
...driver's license.

31:59.423 --> 32:01.050
Unless, of course...

32:02.009 --> 32:03.553
...you got your own truck.

32:05.596 --> 32:07.640
He's not gonna let us
search his truck.

32:07.849 --> 32:10.685
What you mean, "let us"? We the police.

32:10.893 --> 32:12.687
We need a warrant to do that.

32:12.937 --> 32:14.981
We don't even need a key.

32:16.941 --> 32:19.652
Detective, you can't do that.
It's unconstitutional.

32:20.444 --> 32:23.614
Look at that. Look at this.

32:27.326 --> 32:28.161
Look.

32:28.369 --> 32:31.289
Solved the crime
my first day on the job!

32:31.497 --> 32:32.832
We bad detectives.

32:33.040 --> 32:33.875
There they are!

32:34.167 --> 32:38.045
Filing a false report
is a very serious crime.

32:41.257 --> 32:44.802
I'll handle this.
Bring your weeble-wobble ass over here.

32:47.054 --> 32:49.807
- You like snacks?
- Nothing makes me happier.

32:50.016 --> 32:53.644
You'll be snacking on the bottom
of this shoe if this happens again.

32:53.853 --> 32:55.396
Now, you see them ridges?

32:55.605 --> 32:58.608
These ridges will be imprinted
on the back of your ass...

32:58.858 --> 33:01.319
...permanently if this happens again.

33:01.527 --> 33:02.570
You understand?

33:02.778 --> 33:03.946
Thoroughly understand you.

33:04.155 --> 33:07.992
Every time you look at your ass
there's gonna be a print there.

33:08.201 --> 33:09.994
It's gonna remind you of us.

33:10.703 --> 33:12.330
- And of you lying.
- Right.

33:12.830 --> 33:14.290
Don't wanna see those ridges.

33:14.540 --> 33:18.961
Stop eating cold cuts because
it's seeping through your pores.

33:19.170 --> 33:20.338
Will do.

33:20.630 --> 33:23.174
I'll put one ridge on your ass.

33:23.674 --> 33:27.136
Let's roll. That's cool.
Let's get out of here.

33:29.388 --> 33:31.557
Detective, I know I'm new at this...

33:31.766 --> 33:34.644
...but I thought we were supposed
to arrest the bad guys.

33:34.894 --> 33:36.729
Now he owes us one.

33:36.938 --> 33:38.314
So that's how it works.

33:38.689 --> 33:42.652
We let the little fish go, so that
we can catch the big fish later.

33:42.860 --> 33:44.278
I got it. I got it.

33:47.532 --> 33:50.660
You mind if I drive?
I know a shortcut.

33:54.914 --> 33:56.249
You might wanna buckle up.

34:04.757 --> 34:07.426
Are you in a hurry, sir?

34:07.677 --> 34:10.721
Just testing your car.
Balancing out your shit.

34:13.056 --> 34:15.560
When was the last time
you got all up on this thing?

34:15.851 --> 34:18.228
I've never gotten all up
on anything, sir.

34:19.438 --> 34:22.650
Sometimes you gotta feed
some speed to your ride.

34:25.360 --> 34:26.904
Sir! Watch it!

34:31.199 --> 34:34.078
This is the police!
Move your busted-ass vehicle!

34:34.579 --> 34:36.455
Move, move, move, move, move!

34:36.664 --> 34:38.248
This is the LAPD.

34:38.456 --> 34:39.958
We'll pop one in your ass.

34:40.168 --> 34:42.085
We got guns and shit.

34:43.462 --> 34:44.797
I could get used to this!

34:45.505 --> 34:46.340
I like!

34:46.549 --> 34:48.050
I like!

34:48.259 --> 34:49.427
Used to what?

34:52.346 --> 34:55.808
Driving. See, my last partner
did all the driving.

34:56.350 --> 34:58.060
Who was your partner?

34:59.604 --> 35:01.314
I don't wanna talk about it.

35:01.814 --> 35:02.815
Why?

35:03.274 --> 35:07.987
Hey, look, I'm deep, okay? There's
just some places I can't talk about.

35:08.237 --> 35:11.866
We're partners. We gotta communicate.
This thing's like a marriage.

35:12.116 --> 35:14.368
No, this is nothing like a marriage.

35:14.869 --> 35:17.663
- What is it like?
- It's more like a one-night stand.

35:17.914 --> 35:20.625
Wham, bam, thank you, officer.

35:25.254 --> 35:27.423
- It's like that?
- It's like that.

35:27.924 --> 35:31.385
We're just gonna fight crime
and zip the rest of that shit up.

35:31.636 --> 35:33.054
Are you married?

35:33.304 --> 35:34.764
- Girlfriend?
- Not anymore.

35:34.972 --> 35:35.890
What happened?

35:38.392 --> 35:40.186
Work got in the way.

35:41.270 --> 35:42.355
See?

35:47.527 --> 35:49.445
Somebody took out a fire hydrant.

35:55.993 --> 35:58.996
- I'll handle this.
- I gotta get back. I got a headache.

35:59.205 --> 36:01.040
We're on duty.

36:01.249 --> 36:05.253
But I need an aspirin.
A big one, like a hockey puck.

36:05.461 --> 36:06.921
Gentlemen. Excuse me.

36:07.171 --> 36:09.173
Could you come here for a second?

36:09.757 --> 36:11.884
Relax, sir.
Just take it easy for a second.

36:19.684 --> 36:21.269
Morning, officer.

36:24.564 --> 36:26.274
Morning. Where's your aspirins?

36:26.524 --> 36:28.401
Back there by the soda machines.

36:28.776 --> 36:29.610
Appreciate it.

36:40.037 --> 36:42.415
I wanna know how the car
hit the fire hydrant.

36:44.292 --> 36:46.210
- Open the register!
- Don't shoot!

36:46.460 --> 36:47.503
Come on, man!

36:47.795 --> 36:48.629
Oh, man!

36:48.880 --> 36:50.214
Come on! The safe too!

36:58.639 --> 36:59.473
Come on.

37:05.688 --> 37:09.483
37-King-5.
Shots fired. Request help.

37:09.692 --> 37:12.236
418 West Fifth Street.

37:19.410 --> 37:20.411
Detective Malone!

37:20.661 --> 37:21.746
You okay?

37:21.996 --> 37:22.830
Oh, shit!

37:25.791 --> 37:28.085
Get back! Back! Get back!

37:32.340 --> 37:33.883
Freeze!

37:34.091 --> 37:36.219
Put your hands on the pavement!

37:36.427 --> 37:39.055
- Hands on the pavement!
- There is no pavement!

37:39.764 --> 37:41.516
Put them on the Oodles of Noodles.

37:41.766 --> 37:43.768
- Put them on the noodles.
- Chicken or beef?

37:43.976 --> 37:44.852
Chicken!

37:46.479 --> 37:47.396
Cool.

37:47.647 --> 37:49.190
Cool is good.

37:50.066 --> 37:50.983
Miles?

37:51.442 --> 37:52.360
Tulley?

37:57.365 --> 37:58.241
What are you doing?

37:58.449 --> 38:00.701
What am I doing?
What are you doing?

38:00.952 --> 38:02.870
I'm freaking working over here.

38:04.664 --> 38:06.123
I'm coming in!

38:06.374 --> 38:08.042
Put the gun down!

38:08.292 --> 38:09.460
Put the gun down!

38:09.669 --> 38:11.170
Detective Malone, talk to me!

38:11.420 --> 38:13.047
Go out the back way!

38:13.297 --> 38:15.091
Go! The back way!

38:15.383 --> 38:17.051
Go out the back way!

38:17.969 --> 38:18.970
Detective, talk to me!

38:20.847 --> 38:22.056
Take two steps back!

38:23.683 --> 38:24.767
What the hell? Go!

38:26.394 --> 38:27.311
Hold it!

38:29.939 --> 38:30.982
Hold your fire!

38:34.360 --> 38:35.945
You okay?

39:00.553 --> 39:01.762
Listen, it's a dead end!

39:02.013 --> 39:03.681
No shit!

39:08.811 --> 39:12.356
He's behind those dumpsters.
He's freaking out. He's got a gun.

39:15.359 --> 39:16.319
Back up!

39:17.612 --> 39:21.449
Get SWAT up here! Sharpshooters
can take him off from the roof.

39:22.241 --> 39:23.784
No sharpshooters.

39:24.243 --> 39:25.119
Why the hell not?

39:27.038 --> 39:28.539
What are you doing here, man?

39:28.873 --> 39:30.875
- Who's he talking to?
- I don't know.

39:31.334 --> 39:34.337
He high, man. He's hallucinating.
Smoking that shit!

39:34.754 --> 39:36.464
He's high.

39:37.173 --> 39:38.883
Put down the gun and come out!

39:41.928 --> 39:44.013
Hold this. Hold on. I'm going in.

39:44.305 --> 39:45.139
What are you doing?

39:45.932 --> 39:47.308
What are you, crazy?

39:49.769 --> 39:51.479
Miles, what are you doing here?

39:51.938 --> 39:54.815
I just wanna talk to you
before somebody gets hurt!

39:55.107 --> 39:56.818
Please put down the gun!

39:57.068 --> 39:58.736
- Son, come on.
- Shut up!

39:58.945 --> 40:00.196
It hurts my heart...

40:00.404 --> 40:03.074
...to see a kid that has
so much potential.

40:03.324 --> 40:05.451
- You're smarter than that.
- I'm coming out!

40:06.494 --> 40:10.248
Listen. All right, now, goddamn it!
What are you doing?

40:10.498 --> 40:13.626
What are you doing?
You got me out here in this shit.

40:13.835 --> 40:15.920
How many times I told you...

40:16.170 --> 40:20.258
...forget the safe? Go straight for
the cash drawer. Get in and get out.

40:21.175 --> 40:23.553
He's in the way.
Now I can't even get a shot.

40:23.803 --> 40:25.054
I can't either.

40:25.304 --> 40:27.473
Why are you hitting
mom-and-pop stores anyway?

40:27.723 --> 40:29.725
Look, you're a driver, man.

40:29.934 --> 40:33.980
You got skills. You can be out there
on the road, man, doing your shit.

40:34.230 --> 40:38.234
I'm desperate! I need some money!
And why the freak are we whispering?

40:40.111 --> 40:42.530
Back up, nigger! I saw you!

40:44.532 --> 40:46.909
- What are they talking about?
- I don't know.

40:47.201 --> 40:50.997
I'm working on something here,
and you're blowing it for me, man!

40:51.747 --> 40:53.666
I'm sorry, man. I'm messing up.

40:53.916 --> 40:56.002
- I'm messing up.
- It's all right.

40:56.210 --> 40:57.879
Look, I'm not mad at you.

40:58.462 --> 41:02.466
But you're gonna have to give me
the gun and let me arrest you.

41:03.843 --> 41:08.806
Come on, man. Listen. I'll give you
10 grand. You know I'm good for it.

41:10.308 --> 41:11.726
I'm thinking like 50, man.

41:11.976 --> 41:15.479
Tulley, 50?
That's pushing it, man! Damn!

41:15.688 --> 41:19.567
Twenty, and you'll spend one night
in jail. That's the best I can do.

41:19.817 --> 41:21.777
That's it. Best I can do.

41:23.237 --> 41:25.740
All right, fine.
But I'm keeping my gun.

41:25.990 --> 41:29.994
You cannot let me arrest you
and keep the gun, man! Come on!

41:30.286 --> 41:32.872
Damn, I just got this, man.
This is hard to find.

41:33.080 --> 41:37.043
But you're gonna have to give up
the gun. Now, what you wanna do?

41:37.251 --> 41:41.839
You wanna give up the gun or you want
them to put about 7 bullets in your ass?

41:44.175 --> 41:45.801
Okay, now give me that gun!

41:48.137 --> 41:50.306
Don't just hand it to me!

41:50.556 --> 41:53.559
I gotta take it from you.
They're watching.

41:56.145 --> 41:57.647
This is gonna hurt a little.

41:58.523 --> 41:59.607
This is gonna hurt.

42:03.361 --> 42:04.487
Jesus!

42:04.737 --> 42:06.656
That's incredible!

42:07.198 --> 42:09.992
And remember:
You don't know me anymore.

42:10.243 --> 42:11.702
I sure don't.

42:11.911 --> 42:13.663
You didn't used to be so violent.

42:13.913 --> 42:15.957
So he's like,
"Carlson, take my jacket. "

42:16.165 --> 42:19.502
He's like, "I got to do this. "
We're like, "What are you doing?"

42:19.710 --> 42:23.047
He just goes right down the alley,
right up to the guy.

42:23.297 --> 42:25.883
Next thing you know,
he's taking the guy's gun.

42:26.092 --> 42:29.136
Dropped the guy with a punch.
Just leveled him.

42:29.387 --> 42:32.390
I mean, blink and
you would've missed it.

42:32.932 --> 42:34.517
Malone, in my office!

42:34.767 --> 42:36.227
Now!

42:40.356 --> 42:41.566
Not you, Carlson.

42:46.612 --> 42:48.656
I've been looking through your record.

42:49.073 --> 42:50.741
How come I never heard of you?

42:51.450 --> 42:53.828
I was undercover. On the down low.

42:54.036 --> 42:57.456
We need a guy to head Burglary.
Is that the real reason you're here?

42:58.958 --> 42:59.792
Yeah, sure.

43:00.001 --> 43:00.835
It's no secret.

43:01.085 --> 43:05.840
Burglary's been a problem division since
we lost our lead detective last year.

43:06.215 --> 43:08.843
Now, usually we promote
from within the ranks...

43:09.093 --> 43:11.012
...but these guys need someone new.

43:11.262 --> 43:13.556
So if you want the job, you got it.

43:16.434 --> 43:17.476
Excuse me?

43:17.810 --> 43:20.438
You're the new lead detective.
Burglary division.

43:22.982 --> 43:23.941
Me?

43:26.444 --> 43:30.865
Technically, there's a 30-day qualifying
period before I can make it official...

43:31.073 --> 43:34.410
...but with your record I don't think
there'll be any problem.

43:38.873 --> 43:40.708
Well, say something!

43:43.044 --> 43:44.629
Thank you.

43:44.879 --> 43:46.339
Let's party?

43:49.217 --> 43:50.927
What is this? High school?

43:51.135 --> 43:56.265
Listen up. As of now, Detective Malone
is Burglary's new acting lead detective.

43:56.557 --> 43:58.976
Get these processed ASAP.

44:00.102 --> 44:01.562
Thank you.

44:03.397 --> 44:06.734
I got some things I gotta do.
I'll catch up with you later.

44:07.568 --> 44:08.820
I'll take these.

44:09.028 --> 44:10.947
- You know what to do with these?
- Sure.

44:11.155 --> 44:12.573
Great, sir. Sorry.

44:21.833 --> 44:23.584
- Captain Penelli?
- I'm busy now.

44:41.227 --> 44:43.020
Oh, man!

45:03.541 --> 45:05.126
Shit!

45:07.295 --> 45:08.671
Damn!

45:20.183 --> 45:21.392
What?

45:21.934 --> 45:24.228
How do you want me
to handle the rotation?

45:25.354 --> 45:27.440
I don't understand.
What you mean, "rotation"?

45:27.648 --> 45:29.317
The shifts.

45:30.443 --> 45:34.197
I can't figure out everything
on the first day, all right?

45:34.405 --> 45:37.241
I notice you guys had a leak here.
What's that about?

45:37.450 --> 45:40.203
One of the hot-water pipes burst,
flooded all the vents.

45:41.412 --> 45:43.831
They had to flush out the whole system.

45:44.040 --> 45:46.584
This must be the guy
everybody's talking about.

45:46.792 --> 45:48.711
Captain Penelli, Detective Malone.

45:48.920 --> 45:50.254
Malone, Penelli.

45:51.172 --> 45:55.134
I hear great things.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

46:01.015 --> 46:02.892
Nice to meet you too there, sir!

46:03.100 --> 46:04.519
Very nice to meet you!

46:06.020 --> 46:07.271
Glad to be here.

46:07.522 --> 46:08.940
Gotta go!

46:12.735 --> 46:14.570
He's a strange one.

46:30.086 --> 46:31.879
Place is closed.

46:32.922 --> 46:35.758
I said we're closed.
I should've locked up.

46:36.425 --> 46:37.760
Nice to see you, Lou.

46:38.970 --> 46:40.638
I'm looking for Miles.

46:41.013 --> 46:43.099
Well, I haven't seen him.

46:43.307 --> 46:45.810
I got an important message
from his mother.

46:47.812 --> 46:49.772
Well, I still haven't seen him.

46:52.525 --> 46:53.818
Quiet.

46:58.865 --> 47:00.449
Damn, you're good.

47:05.788 --> 47:07.248
You are good.

47:50.833 --> 47:51.959
Good morning. Listen up.

47:52.168 --> 47:56.214
Word is that Jean LaFleur is bringing
a shipment of heroin through town.

47:58.549 --> 48:00.051
They want him in San Diego.

48:00.259 --> 48:02.303
SDPD's done an excellent job...

48:02.595 --> 48:05.640
...shutting down the harbor
and the airports on him.

48:13.981 --> 48:18.486
Detective Malone just transferred.
He'll head our Burglary division.

48:19.487 --> 48:20.780
Detective...

48:20.988 --> 48:23.157
...tell us a little about your plans.

48:25.326 --> 48:28.079
Well, I plan to fight crime.

48:33.626 --> 48:35.002
You know, shit like that.

48:35.211 --> 48:36.045
Great, then.

48:37.505 --> 48:39.674
Does anybody have any questions
for Malone?

48:39.882 --> 48:41.592
Yeah, I got a question.

48:41.843 --> 48:43.761
What do you think about the P-31?

48:45.137 --> 48:46.722
P-31.

48:48.850 --> 48:49.767
What do you think?

48:49.976 --> 48:51.227
It's a piece of shit.

48:53.271 --> 48:57.191
What I mean is, we've all been having
problems with the P-31, right?

48:57.400 --> 49:02.071
I'm just wondering what the new lead
detective here plans to do about it.

49:02.446 --> 49:05.825
Well, all right.
Well, Diaz, is it? Diaz?

49:06.159 --> 49:09.287
What do you think we should do
about it, Diaz?

49:09.662 --> 49:11.247
I think we should scrap it.

49:11.914 --> 49:15.001
How many people think
we should scrap the P-31?

49:17.545 --> 49:18.713
There it is.

49:18.921 --> 49:20.965
Scrapped. Why?
Because you want it scrapped.

49:21.174 --> 49:24.802
It's out of there. P-31, out of there.
No more. Gone.

49:25.178 --> 49:27.180
You want 31 flavors?

49:27.388 --> 49:30.558
Baskin-Robbins is
where you wanna be. Be cool.

49:30.933 --> 49:32.602
That's my partner.

49:33.144 --> 49:34.020
Detective.

49:37.231 --> 49:39.066
What is it?

49:39.317 --> 49:40.943
I'd like to work with a P-40.

49:41.152 --> 49:42.320
Yeah, the P-40's good.

49:44.071 --> 49:45.615
P-40 it is!

49:50.203 --> 49:52.288
What's he doing?
We just got those things.

49:52.497 --> 49:55.750
He's shaking things up.
Maybe that's exactly what we need.

50:13.476 --> 50:15.144
I'm not a cop.

50:15.603 --> 50:18.147
This Tulley asshole
wants to talk to you.

50:18.356 --> 50:20.107
He's down in Interrogation.

50:21.901 --> 50:23.903
Right away. I'll talk with him.

50:24.821 --> 50:26.572
Interrogation's this way.

50:26.781 --> 50:29.158
Knew that. Is he running his mouth?

50:30.034 --> 50:33.120
Tulley says he has information
about another robbery.

50:33.329 --> 50:36.082
But he'll only talk
to the officer who arrested him.

50:37.708 --> 50:39.794
I'll talk to him. Alone.

50:40.002 --> 50:41.629
We'll be watching.

50:43.798 --> 50:47.260
What's going on? You said
I'd spend one night in jail.

50:58.271 --> 51:00.857
What do you wanna tell me?
What is it?

51:01.065 --> 51:03.151
You said I'd only spend
one night in jail.

51:03.359 --> 51:05.069
It's only been one night.

51:05.278 --> 51:07.155
Well, where's my 50 grand?

51:07.488 --> 51:09.282
I said 20 grand.

51:09.782 --> 51:11.951
Well, maybe it's 50 now! Because...

51:16.247 --> 51:19.876
Detectives, I've been assigned
to Mr. Tulley.

51:20.084 --> 51:22.587
Well, great. That's him.

51:22.795 --> 51:25.756
Oh, my God! What in the world?

51:25.965 --> 51:27.466
- Help me!
- What's going on?

51:28.718 --> 51:29.635
Help!

51:29.844 --> 51:31.012
What is this?

51:34.765 --> 51:36.475
Oh, my God!

51:40.730 --> 51:43.608
Take your hands off my client!

51:44.525 --> 51:46.068
It's no use. He ain't talking!

51:46.277 --> 51:48.237
You have your hand over his mouth!

51:54.202 --> 51:58.039
I think we accomplished
enough for one day.

51:58.372 --> 52:01.709
This guy said he has information
on another case.

52:02.001 --> 52:04.378
I wanna know, are you jerking
our chain or not?

52:04.587 --> 52:06.380
I'm not jerking your chain, fella.

52:06.589 --> 52:10.718
This guy Logan owes me
50 thousand dollars.

52:11.552 --> 52:13.513
If I don't get it soon...

52:13.721 --> 52:15.598
...I'm talking!

52:15.806 --> 52:18.309
Who's Logan?
And what do you know about him?

52:18.851 --> 52:22.814
All I can tell you, sir,
is that he's gay, gay, gay!

52:23.022 --> 52:24.607
I've had enough of this!

52:24.816 --> 52:28.694
You certainly have. Come with me.
You'll be hearing from my office!

52:28.903 --> 52:31.280
- He made me bite my tongue.
- Come here.

52:31.948 --> 52:32.907
He hit me here.

52:33.366 --> 52:35.493
Next time use a phone book on him.

52:35.701 --> 52:37.411
And they took my shoelace.

52:37.620 --> 52:39.288
Hearing from your office!

52:39.497 --> 52:41.374
Look how she's all over him.

52:41.624 --> 52:44.669
And then he said I was ugly
and I couldn't read good.

52:49.549 --> 52:51.175
Hey, man. What's up?

52:51.384 --> 52:53.427
Some guy's been calling for you.

52:53.636 --> 52:55.763
- Who was it?
- Said he's your old partner.

52:55.972 --> 52:59.934
He hopes you found what you're looking
for. Your health benefits expire soon.

53:00.309 --> 53:02.395
Whatever the hell
that's supposed to mean.

53:06.524 --> 53:08.234
Shit!

53:33.134 --> 53:33.968
Bingo!

53:37.430 --> 53:40.349
What is it with you
and the heating ducts, sir?

53:41.475 --> 53:43.060
Cold. You don't feel that?

53:43.561 --> 53:44.604
Very cold.

53:44.812 --> 53:47.231
But I'm busy. What is it you want?

53:47.440 --> 53:50.026
I just tried to pull up your records.

53:50.234 --> 53:51.694
I couldn't find any Malone.

53:52.278 --> 53:55.531
Oh, that's probably because
it was spelled...

53:55.740 --> 53:57.700
When I put the name in the list...

53:57.909 --> 53:59.952
The badge number doesn't exist.

54:01.871 --> 54:02.830
Let me talk to you.

54:03.039 --> 54:06.375
- I wanna find out what's going on.
- You're gonna find out.

54:09.587 --> 54:11.005
Now, look.

54:12.006 --> 54:14.008
What I'm about to tell you
is classified.

54:14.217 --> 54:18.179
You tell anyone, I will bust
your ass down to parade detail.

54:18.387 --> 54:19.847
I've been on that detail.

54:20.056 --> 54:23.100
That's permanent horseshit patrol.

54:26.020 --> 54:29.273
This place is a cesspool. But listen.

54:29.607 --> 54:31.025
I'm not from West Covina.

54:32.026 --> 54:33.569
I'm from Internal Affairs.

54:33.820 --> 54:36.030
Oh, man!

54:40.159 --> 54:42.787
All right? This place is a cesspool.

54:43.496 --> 54:46.082
- I can't believe I didn't notice!
- It is!

54:46.290 --> 54:48.459
I mean, it doesn't seem like a cesspool.

54:48.668 --> 54:51.921
Believe it, man! There's a lot
of dirty shit going on here!

54:52.129 --> 54:53.965
That's why they sent me here.

54:54.173 --> 54:56.801
I'm the supercop.
They said, "Go, investigate.

54:57.134 --> 54:59.053
Do what you do.
Find another supercop.

54:59.262 --> 55:02.223
Y'all supercop up as a team,
and crack down the shit. "

55:02.598 --> 55:04.767
"Crack it down. "
That's what I'm here to do.

55:04.976 --> 55:08.437
Are we the only guys that know about it?
We're in the shit now!

55:13.734 --> 55:15.611
You are a good cop, Carlson.

55:15.820 --> 55:18.656
But damn it, man,
you just dug too deep.

55:18.865 --> 55:20.533
What do you want me to do?

55:20.741 --> 55:22.535
Good thing you asked.

55:23.161 --> 55:27.081
Keep your eyes open. Okay?
I need you to be here.

55:27.290 --> 55:29.584
And watch my back. Watch my back.

55:29.792 --> 55:32.336
Got it, sir. I'm out of here.

55:32.962 --> 55:34.463
The other way. Go back.

55:38.843 --> 55:40.052
Shit!

55:59.614 --> 56:01.199
Evidence room.

56:01.532 --> 56:02.533
Shit!

56:06.120 --> 56:09.165
There you are. I just got a call.

56:09.373 --> 56:11.000
413 in progress
at the airport.

56:11.209 --> 56:12.418
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

56:12.627 --> 56:16.672
Bullshit! Someone just stole
a museum exhibit from a cargo hold.

56:16.881 --> 56:18.090
That's my problem?

56:18.508 --> 56:19.884
You're lead detective.

56:20.134 --> 56:22.470
Get out there now!

56:22.678 --> 56:26.140
The FBI and Customs Service
is already on the case.

56:46.285 --> 56:48.704
- Why are you standing here?
- They won't let me in.

56:48.913 --> 56:50.331
Feds are all over it.

56:50.540 --> 56:52.124
That's bullshit!

56:53.543 --> 56:56.671
These boxes contained
an entire Egyptian temple.

56:56.879 --> 56:59.465
Excuse me, here.
Let me see this. Man!

56:59.674 --> 57:00.800
And who are you?

57:01.008 --> 57:03.636
Malone. LAPD.

57:03.845 --> 57:05.596
Agent Gray. FBI.

57:06.639 --> 57:09.350
We'll let you boys in
after we're done.

57:12.145 --> 57:13.646
Look at all this stuff.

57:13.855 --> 57:18.109
Look. They nearly destroyed all this
stuff and they didn't take none of it.

57:18.359 --> 57:20.486
Look, Officer Malone.

57:20.695 --> 57:21.946
Detective.

57:22.155 --> 57:26.450
You know, you're out of your
jurisdiction and you're over your head.

57:26.659 --> 57:29.912
I'm over my head?
No, I'm over your head...

57:30.121 --> 57:32.039
...because your head's up your ass.

57:33.916 --> 57:38.087
You're interfering with
a federal investigation, officer.

57:38.504 --> 57:41.299
Now, if you and your bunch
wanna feel important...

57:41.507 --> 57:43.843
...you can help secure
the outer perimeter.

57:44.635 --> 57:45.803
Are we clear?

57:49.098 --> 57:50.808
We clear.

57:51.309 --> 57:52.977
And please...

57:53.186 --> 57:56.939
...tell your men not to touch
anything on their way out.

57:57.148 --> 57:59.984
- It's like that?
- Yeah, it's like that.

58:10.161 --> 58:12.079
"Head up your ass. "
That was great.

58:12.330 --> 58:14.582
I couldn't believe you said that.

58:14.874 --> 58:16.792
He called me "officer. "

58:17.001 --> 58:21.923
I'm lead detective.
I have 16 citations.

58:22.131 --> 58:23.591
You think that comes easy?

58:23.799 --> 58:26.427
Come on. The guy's nothing
but an FBI asshole.

58:26.636 --> 58:29.639
He thinks we're good for nothing
but sucking down doughnuts.

58:29.847 --> 58:31.807
Let them chase their own
goddamn temple.

58:32.016 --> 58:35.728
They weren't looking for no temple.
They were looking for drugs.

58:35.937 --> 58:37.188
Yes, drugs.

58:37.396 --> 58:39.273
It's the oldest trick in the book.

58:39.482 --> 58:40.566
You smuggle it in...

58:40.775 --> 58:45.154
...boost it before it hits customs,
right? Make it look like a heist.

58:45.363 --> 58:47.240
That's how all the big boys do it.

58:47.490 --> 58:50.409
All they have to do is
look for a truck with a "B" on it.

58:50.868 --> 58:52.161
What do you mean, "B"?

58:52.370 --> 58:53.788
"Bonded. "

58:54.205 --> 58:58.167
Bonded trucks can get
into bonded warehouses.

58:58.668 --> 58:59.627
Let me ask you:

59:00.211 --> 59:01.921
How do you know all this stuff?

59:03.840 --> 59:07.134
Did a little work in bonded warehouses.

59:07.635 --> 59:09.887
All right. So what are we waiting for?

59:10.304 --> 59:13.766
Let's do something, all right?
Come on. Call in air support.

59:15.017 --> 59:17.854
Dispatch, this is 37-King-5...

59:18.062 --> 59:21.607
...put me through
to South Bay air support.

59:27.405 --> 59:29.824
<i>10-12. I've got a white panel truck... </i>

59:30.032 --> 59:34.370
<i>... B-961, southbound on Wheeler
near the Manhattan Beach intersection. </i>

59:34.579 --> 59:36.289
Roger. We're close.

59:40.001 --> 59:41.169
Shit!

59:45.923 --> 59:47.300
Now you're in a hurry?

59:48.217 --> 59:52.513
Sometimes you gotta feed a little speed
to your ride. You know what I'm saying?

01:00:04.358 --> 01:00:05.485
Here we go.

01:00:09.489 --> 01:00:11.157
Check out the driver.

01:00:12.283 --> 01:00:15.578
Five-feet-six, greasy hair, messy,
very disheveled and...

01:00:15.786 --> 01:00:18.539
Are you a hairdresser
or a detective, man?

01:00:19.874 --> 01:00:21.250
That's a jailhouse tat.

01:00:21.667 --> 01:00:23.503
Driver did a stretch somewhere.

01:00:23.711 --> 01:00:25.463
10-12. Requesting backup.

01:00:25.671 --> 01:00:28.049
<i>LAPD, this is Agent Gray. FBI.</i>

01:00:28.257 --> 01:00:31.511
<i>Stand down. I repeat: Stand down. </i>

01:00:31.802 --> 01:00:33.304
This is bullshit!

01:00:33.513 --> 01:00:36.182
Screw them. Come on! Let's do it!

01:00:37.016 --> 01:00:38.559
Come on, you!

01:00:40.478 --> 01:00:41.687
Come on, get the door.

01:00:41.896 --> 01:00:42.855
Come on!

01:00:44.565 --> 01:00:45.525
Drop your weapons!

01:00:45.733 --> 01:00:47.235
Put it down.

01:00:47.443 --> 01:00:50.613
All right, don't move! Stand still!

01:00:50.822 --> 01:00:51.656
Put it down!

01:00:52.406 --> 01:00:54.951
Malone! Take him! He's yours!

01:00:56.494 --> 01:00:58.955
Don't you run from me! Don't you run!

01:00:59.205 --> 01:01:01.374
Let's see those hands, butterball.

01:01:03.543 --> 01:01:04.377
Come here!

01:01:04.585 --> 01:01:06.170
You wanna make me run?

01:01:11.634 --> 01:01:12.593
Come back here!

01:01:32.738 --> 01:01:33.781
Come back here!

01:01:37.618 --> 01:01:38.786
Bring your ass here!

01:01:39.370 --> 01:01:40.246
Come here!

01:01:46.544 --> 01:01:47.712
Come here!

01:01:48.421 --> 01:01:50.423
It's okay. Don't worry. I'm a cop.

01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:53.551
All right?

01:01:54.844 --> 01:01:55.678
Damn!

01:02:00.641 --> 01:02:02.894
Don't you know better
than to run from the police?

01:02:03.102 --> 01:02:03.936
I do.

01:02:04.145 --> 01:02:07.857
You got me tired. I don't like
to get tired. When I get tired...

01:02:08.065 --> 01:02:09.317
...I got ass to whoop.

01:02:09.942 --> 01:02:12.528
That's what I'm about to do.
Get your ass up!

01:02:17.492 --> 01:02:18.743
Bingo.

01:02:19.035 --> 01:02:20.661
That's the shit.

01:02:25.291 --> 01:02:29.545
We showed them. We showed them, and
that's what I wanted to do, you know?

01:02:29.754 --> 01:02:31.589
- Put this into evidence.
- Exactly.

01:02:31.797 --> 01:02:33.549
Evidence. I'll go up with it.

01:02:33.758 --> 01:02:35.968
I want you interrogating
those men right now.

01:02:36.177 --> 01:02:38.679
No. See, I need to go up
with this stuff...

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:41.098
...and book it into evidence personally.

01:02:41.307 --> 01:02:42.141
Why?

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.771
I gotta go through it
for clues and shit.

01:02:47.313 --> 01:02:50.441
Interrogate the suspects.
Find out where they were going.

01:02:50.983 --> 01:02:55.279
Then, when you get them to talk, you can
go through all the evidence you want.

01:02:55.488 --> 01:02:57.365
But, sir...

01:02:58.282 --> 01:03:02.954
If I get the clue, it'd make
for a better ass-whooping interrogation.

01:03:03.162 --> 01:03:05.081
Let's hear it for Detective Malone!

01:03:17.552 --> 01:03:20.346
That's it! I want a lawyer.
You cops can't do this.

01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:22.181
I got news for you.
I ain't a cop.

01:03:24.725 --> 01:03:26.185
God, he's good.

01:03:26.394 --> 01:03:28.771
I checked.
West Covina never heard of him.

01:03:29.772 --> 01:03:31.858
- So you know.
- Know what?

01:03:32.066 --> 01:03:33.484
He's Internal Affairs.

01:03:33.693 --> 01:03:35.820
What are you talking about?
He's not I.A.

01:03:36.028 --> 01:03:36.863
He's not?

01:03:37.071 --> 01:03:38.322
Hell, no. He's FBI.

01:03:39.866 --> 01:03:41.868
But he hates the FBI.

01:03:42.076 --> 01:03:45.121
That's to throw you off.
You think this is an accident?

01:03:45.329 --> 01:03:48.958
He knew about the heroin from the start.
FBI planted him here.

01:03:49.167 --> 01:03:52.795
Thought he'd get first jump on the
burglary. Afraid we'd screw it up.

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:54.839
Pencil-dicks.

01:03:58.426 --> 01:04:00.970
You don't get that training
at the academy.

01:04:01.179 --> 01:04:02.930
No, that's old school, man.

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:04.891
You're crushing my head!

01:04:07.393 --> 01:04:09.228
That's federal government training.

01:04:09.437 --> 01:04:12.023
Like Navy SEAL stuff.

01:04:14.567 --> 01:04:16.319
Let's go give him a hand.

01:04:18.779 --> 01:04:22.033
All right! All right!
I'll talk! Oh, man!

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:57.735
Look at you.

01:04:57.944 --> 01:05:01.405
It was all worth it for you, baby.

01:05:07.912 --> 01:05:09.288
What are you doing up there?

01:05:10.498 --> 01:05:15.294
I'm just so happy that we're keeping
these drugs off the street.

01:05:15.503 --> 01:05:18.214
Get over it. They're going
right back out again.

01:05:18.422 --> 01:05:19.340
Why?

01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:22.760
Because the FBI wants to take it
to their lab right away.

01:05:22.969 --> 01:05:24.095
Roll it out.

01:05:28.724 --> 01:05:29.559
Malone, come on!

01:05:30.059 --> 01:05:31.477
Let's go.

01:05:32.979 --> 01:05:34.188
Come on, Malone.

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:48.619
Detective.

01:05:49.787 --> 01:05:52.498
That heroin belongs to Jean LaFleur.

01:05:52.874 --> 01:05:54.500
We've been after him for 5 years.

01:05:54.709 --> 01:05:57.670
He keeps shifting his operations
between the U.S. And Mexico.

01:05:58.004 --> 01:06:00.339
We're taking it down
to our lab right now.

01:06:00.548 --> 01:06:02.091
That's not a good idea.

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:03.217
Why not?

01:06:04.844 --> 01:06:06.596
Why don't we just keep it here?

01:06:06.804 --> 01:06:10.224
LaFleur doesn't know we have it.
We could use it for bait.

01:06:11.601 --> 01:06:12.727
You mean a sting?

01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:15.688
Exactly. A sting!

01:06:16.606 --> 01:06:20.401
LaFleur expects these drugs
to be in San Diego in three hours.

01:06:20.651 --> 01:06:23.988
What kind of sting operation can you
get off the ground before then?

01:06:24.655 --> 01:06:27.450
The driver told me one of the guys
on the truck was new.

01:06:27.658 --> 01:06:29.744
You can replace him with somebody else.

01:06:29.952 --> 01:06:33.915
Then catch LaFleur when he goes
to pick up the drugs. Bam! Got him!

01:06:34.123 --> 01:06:35.458
Let me get this straight.

01:06:35.666 --> 01:06:39.545
You're volunteering to escort
these drugs into the hands...

01:06:39.754 --> 01:06:42.757
...of the most dangerous dealer
in the northern hemisphere?

01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:44.133
Hell, no!

01:06:44.342 --> 01:06:46.010
What do you need to make it work?

01:06:47.553 --> 01:06:49.972
- Me?
- You're the man for the job!

01:06:50.181 --> 01:06:53.059
FBI will have tactical command,
but we'll follow your lead.

01:06:53.267 --> 01:06:56.229
It's very brave. Let's go.
There's not much time.

01:06:56.437 --> 01:06:58.231
Way to go, Malone. Way to go.

01:06:58.481 --> 01:07:02.026
- I'm just suggesting some shit.
- We need more men like you!

01:07:05.154 --> 01:07:08.115
All right. Hurry up.
Go. Get out of here!

01:07:08.407 --> 01:07:10.201
Wait. Hold up. Wait a minute.

01:07:10.409 --> 01:07:13.496
You wanted to go.
I'm getting you out of here. Go!

01:07:13.746 --> 01:07:16.582
You wouldn't still be here
unless that diamond was here.

01:07:16.791 --> 01:07:17.625
I want my cut!

01:07:18.042 --> 01:07:21.379
There ain't nothing to cut.
I gotta get the diamond first.

01:07:21.629 --> 01:07:22.839
Go get it. I'll wait.

01:07:23.047 --> 01:07:26.050
I'm trying to. First, I gotta
run a sting on a drug dealer.

01:07:26.425 --> 01:07:27.802
You're a goddamn liar!

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:30.805
Would I make this shit up?
Get out of here!

01:07:31.013 --> 01:07:34.142
- I'll see you at Lou's tomorrow.
- I wanna talk about this!

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:36.352
I don't know what you're doing...

01:07:36.561 --> 01:07:38.020
...but it ain't gonna work!

01:07:38.271 --> 01:07:40.106
And let me get my gun back!

01:07:46.571 --> 01:07:50.366
Look. Maybe this isn't
a good idea, you know?

01:07:50.575 --> 01:07:53.536
- This is a great idea. It'll work.
- Brilliant.

01:07:53.744 --> 01:07:57.123
- LaFleur's looking for this.
- We know what we're doing, detective.

01:07:57.331 --> 01:07:59.083
Oh, I'm a detective now.

01:07:59.792 --> 01:08:01.169
Give us a level, please.

01:08:02.295 --> 01:08:03.754
All right, detective.

01:08:03.963 --> 01:08:08.176
The objective is to have these men
see you as if you were one of them:

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:12.263
A member of the criminal underworld.
It's important your speech...

01:08:12.513 --> 01:08:17.350
...and your behavior are congruent with
their expectation of a fellow criminal.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.229
I get it. Sort of "walk the walk. "

01:08:20.438 --> 01:08:21.354
That's right.

01:08:21.898 --> 01:08:24.442
You have to look, act...

01:08:24.649 --> 01:08:26.944
...and even think like a criminal.

01:08:27.153 --> 01:08:28.946
Change your speech patterns too.

01:08:29.197 --> 01:08:33.367
Criminals like to use slang terminology
and profanity and so forth...

01:08:33.576 --> 01:08:36.912
...especially with regard to police
and authority figures.

01:08:37.162 --> 01:08:39.916
You mean like, "Shut the hell up,
you dickless FBl... "

01:08:40.124 --> 01:08:41.917
- That's right.
- "You stupid ass. "

01:08:42.126 --> 01:08:43.502
- That'll do.
- "You tight... "

01:08:43.711 --> 01:08:44.921
Enough!

01:08:46.714 --> 01:08:47.798
All right, listen up.

01:08:48.006 --> 01:08:49.759
LaFleur's a killer.

01:08:49.966 --> 01:08:54.721
If he senses anything amiss, Malone
is gonna be in one hell of a tight spot.

01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:03.523
If anything happens to me,
forget everything I ever told you.

01:09:03.731 --> 01:09:05.817
You mean about Internal Affairs?

01:09:06.024 --> 01:09:07.819
No, Carlson. I mean about everything.

01:09:08.152 --> 01:09:10.112
Detective, saddle up.

01:09:10.321 --> 01:09:11.906
Good luck.

01:09:16.368 --> 01:09:19.247
Carlson, remember. Forget it!

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:20.581
Time to go.

01:09:23.167 --> 01:09:24.085
Detective.

01:09:24.710 --> 01:09:28.506
If my client gets a scratch
on him while he's in your custody...

01:09:28.714 --> 01:09:33.719
...I'll see your badge is revoked
and you're thrown in jail. Okay?

01:09:33.928 --> 01:09:35.470
You can't touch me.

01:09:38.599 --> 01:09:42.310
He'll be fine, counselor.
Malone, let's get this show on the road.

01:09:43.354 --> 01:09:45.022
Drive. Buckle up.

01:09:48.067 --> 01:09:48.943
Give me video.

01:09:49.152 --> 01:09:50.569
<i>Let's get one thing straight. </i>

01:09:50.778 --> 01:09:53.488
This is my side here
and that's your side there.

01:09:53.698 --> 01:09:55.908
Stay on your side
and I'm gonna stay on mine.

01:09:56.617 --> 01:09:57.577
Gentlemen.

01:09:57.785 --> 01:09:59.328
Keep the chatter to a minimum.

01:09:59.537 --> 01:10:02.582
You don't like the show,
change the channel.

01:10:02.957 --> 01:10:05.126
And keep this channel clear.

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.715
Who is this guy?

01:10:11.174 --> 01:10:12.258
That's Malone.

01:10:13.968 --> 01:10:15.428
I can't drive if you do that.

01:10:16.012 --> 01:10:17.388
Drive!

01:10:37.074 --> 01:10:38.493
We're coming up on our exit.

01:10:40.411 --> 01:10:43.664
All units, this is Gray.
Fall back and keep your distance.

01:10:53.966 --> 01:10:55.426
We're approaching the site.

01:10:55.635 --> 01:10:57.970
LAPD, take the south side.
We'll take the north.

01:11:22.954 --> 01:11:25.498
They're headed into warehouse 3.

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:26.624
Focus in.

01:11:26.833 --> 01:11:27.667
Closer.

01:11:35.967 --> 01:11:36.843
This is it.

01:11:37.051 --> 01:11:38.970
- You sure?
- Yeah. Warehouse 3.

01:11:39.303 --> 01:11:43.599
All right, Benny, sit tight
and keep your mouth shut.

01:11:43.808 --> 01:11:45.017
Thanks for the tip.

01:11:51.649 --> 01:11:52.859
What's Malone doing?

01:12:00.658 --> 01:12:02.577
<i>They're coming in behind you. </i>

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:04.704
Get ready. Here he comes.

01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:12.003
That's what I'm talking about!

01:12:12.795 --> 01:12:14.881
- That's the shit.
- You're right!

01:12:15.089 --> 01:12:17.300
All 500 kilos!

01:12:18.134 --> 01:12:21.304
What are you talking about?
Let's get out! I want my cut!

01:12:21.512 --> 01:12:23.639
- You still got it?
- We still have a signal.

01:12:23.848 --> 01:12:24.932
It's just distorted.

01:12:26.142 --> 01:12:27.310
Can you hear him?

01:12:27.518 --> 01:12:30.688
We can't get out of here, okay?
They got cops everywhere.

01:12:30.897 --> 01:12:32.231
So? You're one of them.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:35.651
I'm a drug dealer now.

01:12:36.152 --> 01:12:39.071
Man, listen to me.
You're a jewel thief.

01:12:39.614 --> 01:12:41.782
I'm a drug dealer now!

01:12:41.991 --> 01:12:44.619
Why you selling this
when you got that diamond?

01:12:45.369 --> 01:12:46.537
Just like old times.

01:12:47.413 --> 01:12:49.248
I don't believe that shit!

01:12:51.292 --> 01:12:52.502
Is this a reunion?

01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:55.713
Look what we got here. Give it up.

01:12:56.589 --> 01:12:58.424
Isn't that beautiful? Say bye.

01:12:59.217 --> 01:13:00.176
Welcome to the party.

01:13:00.551 --> 01:13:01.594
Son of a bitch!

01:13:02.345 --> 01:13:03.638
We've lost him.

01:13:03.846 --> 01:13:06.474
I'll enjoy doing you more
than I did Eddie.

01:13:07.016 --> 01:13:08.184
Shut up!

01:13:17.276 --> 01:13:18.945
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:13:19.153 --> 01:13:21.322
- Know anything about this?
- I don't know shit!

01:13:21.531 --> 01:13:22.949
I'm gonna throw up.

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:31.415
What the hell?

01:13:31.624 --> 01:13:33.835
All units, stand by.

01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:39.924
What's going on?

01:13:40.132 --> 01:13:41.175
I don't know!

01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:43.803
I never know what's going on!

01:13:49.767 --> 01:13:50.643
Take it down!

01:13:50.852 --> 01:13:51.936
Here! Bring it in!

01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:02.822
Out of the truck. Out of the truck!

01:14:08.411 --> 01:14:09.871
Benny, what's going on?

01:14:10.329 --> 01:14:11.664
It took longer than I thought.

01:14:11.956 --> 01:14:13.916
- What happened to your face?
- Nothing.

01:14:14.125 --> 01:14:14.959
Not a big deal.

01:14:15.209 --> 01:14:16.627
Who hired these two guys?

01:14:16.836 --> 01:14:18.629
I did. You told me to get guys.

01:14:19.589 --> 01:14:21.549
You didn't introduce me.
How you doing?

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:24.594
Pete. Nice to meet you.
Heard a lot about you.

01:14:26.262 --> 01:14:27.513
And who might you be?

01:14:28.681 --> 01:14:31.517
Don't mess with him.
That's a stone-cold killer.

01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:34.687
You don't want to mess with him.
He's stone-cold.

01:14:35.313 --> 01:14:40.234
That boy is bad. I seen him rip
somebody's guts out through their ass...

01:14:40.526 --> 01:14:42.111
...and their eyes fell out.

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:43.362
Do the move you do!

01:14:43.571 --> 01:14:45.781
The gut-and-eyes move.

01:14:55.124 --> 01:14:57.502
That's where they went splat.
Just dropped them.

01:14:57.710 --> 01:14:58.836
I'm bad.

01:14:59.212 --> 01:15:03.174
I'll rip your lips off and
kiss my ass with them shits.

01:15:03.382 --> 01:15:04.383
I seen him do it.

01:15:04.592 --> 01:15:06.135
I do that.
That's how I get down.

01:15:06.344 --> 01:15:09.514
I'll rip your tongue out
and lick my balls with them.

01:15:09.722 --> 01:15:10.890
Shut up.

01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:12.391
Check him out.

01:15:13.976 --> 01:15:15.937
Francois, you search him.

01:15:16.771 --> 01:15:18.564
- We're moving in.
- No, wait.

01:15:18.898 --> 01:15:21.359
This must be a part of his plan.

01:15:21.567 --> 01:15:24.070
What plan?
He's unarmed and outnumbered.

01:15:24.278 --> 01:15:26.989
Trust me.
You should see Malone's résumé.

01:15:28.157 --> 01:15:30.535
This is like a walk in the park for him.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.912
I must tell you, Pete.

01:15:33.704 --> 01:15:35.373
You look the part...

01:15:35.873 --> 01:15:37.834
...you certainly talk the talk...

01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:41.838
...but you still stink like a cop.

01:15:42.964 --> 01:15:44.799
Damn it!
I knew he would catch us, man.

01:15:45.007 --> 01:15:46.717
Shut up! That's bullshit.

01:15:46.968 --> 01:15:50.721
Come on, man. Just talk to him.
We might get out of here!

01:15:51.639 --> 01:15:53.057
See? He's lying!

01:15:53.266 --> 01:15:57.436
If I was a cop, would I have busted
his shit? That's bleeding!

01:15:57.645 --> 01:15:58.813
Lock him in the car.

01:15:59.355 --> 01:16:00.523
Get him out of here.

01:16:00.731 --> 01:16:01.691
If I was a cop...

01:16:02.066 --> 01:16:03.151
Shut up!

01:16:05.319 --> 01:16:06.988
My nose bleeding!

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:08.489
Damn!

01:16:09.073 --> 01:16:10.283
You better tell us the truth.

01:16:11.742 --> 01:16:13.286
He's a cop.

01:16:13.953 --> 01:16:16.289
He hijacked the truck. This is a setup.

01:16:16.497 --> 01:16:19.625
If I was a cop, FBls would be
in here right now, man...

01:16:19.834 --> 01:16:21.294
...taking everybody to jail!

01:16:22.795 --> 01:16:24.172
I think...

01:16:24.714 --> 01:16:26.382
...I have an idea.

01:16:33.014 --> 01:16:34.849
You wanna prove you aren't a cop?

01:16:37.727 --> 01:16:38.686
You say he's lying.

01:16:40.313 --> 01:16:41.314
Damn right.

01:16:41.522 --> 01:16:42.732
Shoot him.

01:16:43.983 --> 01:16:45.443
Shoot him.

01:16:46.027 --> 01:16:47.028
No problem.

01:16:49.489 --> 01:16:50.323
You son of a bitch!

01:16:50.531 --> 01:16:51.991
I meant, kill him.

01:16:53.576 --> 01:16:56.454
You didn't say that.
You just said, "Shoot him. "

01:16:57.747 --> 01:16:59.624
You wanna prove you aren't a cop?

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.460
Kill him.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.924
There ain't no coming back for him.

01:17:18.601 --> 01:17:21.395
That's it. We're moving in.
All units, move in.

01:17:22.355 --> 01:17:23.189
Let's go!

01:17:48.714 --> 01:17:49.549
Shit!

01:17:54.887 --> 01:17:57.473
Give me the diamond or
I'll pop one in your ass!

01:17:57.682 --> 01:17:58.933
You had your chance.

01:18:09.402 --> 01:18:10.528
Freeze! LAPD!

01:18:10.736 --> 01:18:12.321
Show me your hands!

01:18:17.535 --> 01:18:18.369
Nice shot.

01:18:22.748 --> 01:18:24.959
Get out of the car! Turn around!

01:18:34.218 --> 01:18:35.052
Shit!

01:19:16.761 --> 01:19:18.638
All units, this is Agent Gray, FBI.

01:19:18.846 --> 01:19:21.891
We have no authority to pursue
the suspect beyond our border.

01:19:22.225 --> 01:19:24.143
<i>Do not cross into Mexico!</i>

01:19:45.331 --> 01:19:49.669
Pursuit of suspect heading southbound.
We have an undercover officer onboard.

01:19:49.877 --> 01:19:52.588
I repeat: We have
a friendly onboard. Over!

01:19:52.797 --> 01:19:53.756
<i>Roger that!</i>

01:20:03.432 --> 01:20:04.600
Hold on!

01:20:21.576 --> 01:20:22.827
Shit!

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:18.758
Look out!

01:21:31.354 --> 01:21:33.439
Get him! I'm glad to see y'all!

01:21:34.065 --> 01:21:35.691
What you waiting for? Go!

01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:38.319
We can't, Malone.
We have no jurisdiction.

01:21:38.528 --> 01:21:40.988
Damn that! Damn the jurisdiction!
Go! Now!

01:21:41.197 --> 01:21:43.533
We cannot cross into Mexico.

01:21:43.866 --> 01:21:44.700
- You can't?
- No.

01:21:44.909 --> 01:21:45.868
- You can't?
- No!

01:21:46.077 --> 01:21:47.370
Watch me.

01:21:48.871 --> 01:21:49.705
Believe that!

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.750
Move your ass!

01:22:17.775 --> 01:22:19.318
Damn it! One bullet.

01:22:30.663 --> 01:22:31.664
Come on, Miles!

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:38.754
Shit!

01:23:14.248 --> 01:23:17.084
- You're under arrest.
- What are you doing?

01:23:17.293 --> 01:23:19.670
I'm arresting you before they get here.

01:23:19.879 --> 01:23:22.089
I'll blow your head off
before they get here.

01:23:23.466 --> 01:23:26.344
The way I see it
is you got 30 seconds...

01:23:26.552 --> 01:23:28.930
<i>...before they make
a piñata out of you.</i>

01:23:29.138 --> 01:23:30.389
What are they talking about?

01:23:31.557 --> 01:23:33.893
Malone is an expert negotiator.

01:23:34.101 --> 01:23:35.311
He's an expert, sir.

01:23:36.687 --> 01:23:38.105
You got two choices.

01:23:38.439 --> 01:23:40.566
You can wind up somebody's bitch...

01:23:40.942 --> 01:23:42.485
<i>...or somebody's señorita. </i>

01:23:42.693 --> 01:23:44.487
Make up your mind. Your choice.

01:23:44.779 --> 01:23:47.740
I got three choices.
Maybe I just tell them who you are.

01:23:47.949 --> 01:23:51.869
You'll shut your mouth. Maybe
I'll cut you in on the diamond.

01:23:52.286 --> 01:23:56.165
Shithead, I got the goddamn diamond.

01:23:56.374 --> 01:23:58.417
Let me get that.
I'm your only way out!

01:23:59.168 --> 01:24:00.628
Now, give me the gun.

01:24:00.878 --> 01:24:02.547
You don't wanna go to jail
in Mexico.

01:24:02.755 --> 01:24:07.009
Nobody wanna go to jail in Mexico.
They put burritos in your ass.

01:24:07.218 --> 01:24:08.136
Shut up!

01:24:08.344 --> 01:24:11.264
Come on, Deke. Give me the gun.
Come on!

01:24:11.472 --> 01:24:15.434
They think I'm a cop!
They think I'm a cop, man!

01:24:15.685 --> 01:24:17.645
I can help you, okay?

01:24:17.895 --> 01:24:20.815
You don't wanna die here.
Now give that up.

01:24:21.023 --> 01:24:24.026
If you screw me, I swear to God,
I'll come back for you.

01:24:24.235 --> 01:24:25.903
I'll come back for you!

01:24:26.195 --> 01:24:27.280
Give me the gun!

01:24:29.866 --> 01:24:32.285
There you go.
Let me get that from you.

01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:34.620
Come on. Let it go.

01:24:38.958 --> 01:24:40.793
There you go.

01:24:46.674 --> 01:24:48.176
This is gonna hurt a bit.

01:24:50.887 --> 01:24:51.971
Holy Christ!

01:24:55.933 --> 01:24:56.851
That's for Eddie.

01:25:02.732 --> 01:25:04.192
You son of a bitch!

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:05.860
Come back here!

01:25:06.152 --> 01:25:07.278
You son of a bitch!

01:25:08.154 --> 01:25:09.489
Miles, you die!

01:25:44.232 --> 01:25:45.525
You all right?

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:48.778
I needed a vacation anyway, right?

01:25:50.488 --> 01:25:53.199
The FBI needs to talk to you,
Detective Malone.

01:25:57.578 --> 01:26:01.290
Peterson, regional director, FBI.
We need to talk.

01:26:01.499 --> 01:26:03.626
Wait a minute. Slow down.

01:26:03.835 --> 01:26:05.711
No, lieutenant, I will not slow down.

01:26:06.003 --> 01:26:08.131
Is this man one of yours...

01:26:08.923 --> 01:26:10.299
...or not?

01:26:12.135 --> 01:26:13.678
You bet your ass he is.

01:26:14.554 --> 01:26:17.390
Well, I'm gonna find out
what happened here...

01:26:17.765 --> 01:26:22.895
...even if it means putting your entire
department under federal review.

01:26:25.398 --> 01:26:27.024
Nice work.

01:26:32.697 --> 01:26:37.034
My office spent an hour talking to West
Covina and the U.S. Attorney's Office...

01:26:37.243 --> 01:26:39.996
...trying to find out just
who it is you're working for.

01:26:40.204 --> 01:26:42.623
Now we know it's not the Bureau.

01:26:42.832 --> 01:26:45.001
It's time that you
gave us an explanation.

01:26:50.173 --> 01:26:51.674
<i>I'm a federale. </i>

01:26:51.883 --> 01:26:52.717
<i>A federale?</i>

01:26:54.093 --> 01:26:56.637
Look across that border.
What do you see?

01:26:56.888 --> 01:27:00.183
That is the Democratic
Republic of Mexico.

01:27:00.391 --> 01:27:01.225
You're Mexican?

01:27:01.434 --> 01:27:03.978
That's right.
On my mother's father's side.

01:27:04.187 --> 01:27:05.188
I can see it.

01:27:05.396 --> 01:27:06.689
<i>Glacias.  Thank you.</i>

01:27:06.898 --> 01:27:09.317
Gentlemen, I shouldn't be
telling y'all this.

01:27:09.525 --> 01:27:11.068
<i>I could lose my federale- hood.</i>

01:27:11.277 --> 01:27:12.111
Your what?

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:13.738
<i>My federale- hood!</i>

01:27:15.031 --> 01:27:17.158
Look, I had to throw you guys off, okay?

01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:19.285
I was doing it for my country.

01:27:19.494 --> 01:27:20.828
The red...

01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:22.705
...the white...

01:27:23.539 --> 01:27:24.582
...and the green.

01:27:26.083 --> 01:27:29.212
If you'll excuse me,
I have to cross this border...

01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:32.548
<i>...and school some of my compadres,
you know...</i>

01:27:32.757 --> 01:27:36.427
...on things we like to talk about.
So y'all stay up. Be cool.

01:27:44.727 --> 01:27:48.439
What's happening?
Hook a brother up with a taco!

01:27:48.648 --> 01:27:50.233
A burrito!

01:27:54.028 --> 01:27:58.324
I can't believe so much bad shit
can happen on such a beautiful day.

01:28:02.995 --> 01:28:04.580
Yeah, what?

01:28:04.997 --> 01:28:06.749
I think your Spanish is a little rusty.

01:28:06.958 --> 01:28:10.419
You just told those men
you got a big cat in your pants.

01:28:14.257 --> 01:28:17.593
<i>That's a Latin thing. Macho.
You wouldn't understand.</i>

01:28:18.302 --> 01:28:20.763
No, I think I do understand...

01:28:23.724 --> 01:28:24.684
...Logan.

01:28:24.976 --> 01:28:25.810
What?

01:28:29.021 --> 01:28:30.398
How'd you know it was me?

01:28:30.606 --> 01:28:32.525
I started thinking if I was Logan...

01:28:32.733 --> 01:28:37.113
...and had my diamond hidden
in a police building, what would I do?

01:28:37.488 --> 01:28:39.073
So I thought like a crook.

01:28:39.407 --> 01:28:40.950
Is that right?

01:28:41.701 --> 01:28:42.869
I don't believe this.

01:28:43.077 --> 01:28:45.037
He's a major felon.

01:28:45.371 --> 01:28:47.874
This is one hell of a bust, Carlson.

01:28:48.958 --> 01:28:51.294
It's a hell of a bust for us.

01:28:53.379 --> 01:28:55.131
It's just too bad we can't make it.

01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:57.133
Say what?

01:28:57.425 --> 01:28:59.719
You heard the FBI.
They're extremely strict...

01:28:59.927 --> 01:29:03.723
...about pursuing suspects
across international borders.

01:29:04.599 --> 01:29:06.934
And you're just out of our jurisdiction.

01:29:11.564 --> 01:29:12.690
You're...?

01:29:13.608 --> 01:29:15.276
Exactly, because I'm across the...

01:29:15.485 --> 01:29:18.988
If I'm across the border and you're
over there, there's no way you...

01:29:23.034 --> 01:29:25.036
I love this jurisdiction shit!

01:29:27.872 --> 01:29:30.750
I guess this is the last time
I'm gonna see you boys.

01:29:32.043 --> 01:29:34.587
But maybe we'll catch you later.

01:29:34.962 --> 01:29:35.797
Is it like that?

01:29:36.172 --> 01:29:37.632
Yeah. It's like that.

01:29:48.726 --> 01:29:50.937
Right there. Jurisdiction.

01:29:54.482 --> 01:29:55.399
Thanks.

01:29:58.736 --> 01:30:00.571
<i>Viva Las Mexico... </i>

01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:02.198
...and I'm out!
