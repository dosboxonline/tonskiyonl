01:53.780 --> 01:57.125
The Assistant Warden wants this
one out of the block early.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.123
Wants to get it over with fast.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.920
Okay, let's do it.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.381
Psst. Hey.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.299
Come on, wake up, it's time.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.549
Wake up. Let's go, it's time.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.166
Well, this is it.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.884
7474505B.

04:20.552 --> 04:24.056
- What wing?
- Maximum wing, Block 9.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.478
Standard release?

04:25.557 --> 04:28.026
Parole, three out of
five. Good behaviour.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.279
Give me a minute.

04:59.591 --> 05:02.219
One Timex digital watch, broken.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.097
One unused prophylactic.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.239
One soiled.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.758
Boots, black. Belt, black.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.101
One black suit jacket.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.105
One pair black suit pants.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.436
One hat. Black.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.858
One pair of sunglasses.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.199
$23.07.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.708
Sign here.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.155
What's this?

08:01.231 --> 08:02.323
What?

08:02.816 --> 08:04.238
This car.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.240
This stupid car.

08:08.697 --> 08:10.620
Where's the Cadillac?

08:12.575 --> 08:14.794
The Caddy. Where's the Caddy?

08:14.869 --> 08:16.121
The what?

08:16.955 --> 08:18.673
The Cadillac we used to have.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.466
The Bluesmobile.

08:20.542 --> 08:21.964
I traded it.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.879
You traded the
Bluesmobile for this?

08:23.962 --> 08:25.714
No, for a microphone.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.219
A microphone?

08:28.925 --> 08:30.927
Okay, I can see that.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.520
What the hell is this?

08:32.595 --> 08:34.268
This was a bargain.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.091
I picked it up at
the Mount Prospect

08:36.092 --> 08:37.647
City Police Auction last spring.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.847
It's an old Mount
Prospect police car.

08:39.847 --> 08:42.022
They were practically
giving them away.

08:43.063 --> 08:45.317
Well, thank you, pal.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.611
The day I get out of prison,

08:48.695 --> 08:52.450
my own brother picks
me up in a police car.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.521
You don't like it?

09:22.562 --> 09:24.280
No, I don't like it.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.293
Car's got a lot of pick-up.

09:45.376 --> 09:48.505
It's got a cop motor, a
440 cubic-inch plant.

09:48.588 --> 09:52.138
It's got cop tyres, cop
suspension, cop shocks.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.347
It was a model made
before catalytic

09:54.348 --> 09:56.938
converters so it'll run
good on regular gas.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.060
What do you say?

09:58.139 --> 10:00.392
Is it the new
Bluesmobile, or what?

10:03.269 --> 10:05.192
Fix the cigarette lighter.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.690
What are we doing here?

10:45.520 --> 10:48.490
You promised you'd visit the
Penguin the day you got out.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.114
Yeah. So, I lied to her.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.903
You can't lie to a nun.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.615
We gotta go in and
visit the Penguin.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.625
No fucking way.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.016
Who is it?

12:02.096 --> 12:03.689
Jake and Elwood.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.104
Come in.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.956
Hello, boys.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.876
Nice to see you.

12:31.668 --> 12:34.091
Please, have a seat.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.402
No, boys. Come over
here in front of me.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.067
I want to see your faces.

13:09.956 --> 13:13.756
The county took a tax assessment
of this property last month.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.629
They want $5,000.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.133
Doesn't the Church
have to pay that?

13:20.633 --> 13:23.762
They would, if they were
interested in keeping the place.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.765
But they aren't.

13:27.557 --> 13:30.356
The Archbishop wants to
sell this building outright

13:30.435 --> 13:32.108
to the Board of Education.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.196
What's gonna happen to you?

13:34.272 --> 13:37.446
I'll be sent to the
missions: Africa,

13:38.443 --> 13:39.786
Latin America,

13:41.112 --> 13:42.659
- Korea...
- Forget it.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.123
$5,000? No problem.

13:44.198 --> 13:46.200
We'll have it for you in
the morning. Let's go.

13:46.284 --> 13:50.915
No. I will not take your
filthy, stolen money.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.134
Well, then.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.671
I guess you're really
up shit creek.

13:59.964 --> 14:02.183
I beg your pardon.
What did you say?

14:03.634 --> 14:05.056
I offered to help you.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.433
You refused to take our money.

14:10.641 --> 14:13.941
Then I said, "I guess you're
really up shit creek."

14:14.062 --> 14:15.905
- Ow.
- Christ, Jake, take it easy, man.

14:15.980 --> 14:16.980
Elwood.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.952
Jesus Christ.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.620
Shit. Goddamn it.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.330
Son of a bitch.

14:25.490 --> 14:28.289
Jesus Christ. You son of a bitch.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.328
You fat penguin.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.341
Fuck this noise, man.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.390
You are such a disappointing pair.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.393
I prayed so hard for you.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.062
It saddens and hurts me

14:56.396 --> 14:58.649
that the two young
men whom I raised

14:58.731 --> 15:00.733
to believe in the
Ten Commandments,

15:00.983 --> 15:04.078
have returned to me as two thieves

15:04.195 --> 15:08.496
with filthy mouths
and bad attitudes.

15:09.534 --> 15:12.834
Get out. And don't come back

15:13.704 --> 15:17.834
until you've redeemed yourselves.

15:24.340 --> 15:28.220
Boys, you gotta learn not
to talk to nuns that way.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.478
Jake, Elwood.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.651
- Curtis.
- Hey, man.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.068
You look fine, man.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.270
Good to see you, man.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.942
Hey, buy you boys a drink?

15:42.608 --> 15:44.952
Boys, things are bad.

15:46.028 --> 15:49.032
They gonna sell this place
to the Board of Education

15:49.115 --> 15:51.209
and I'll be out on the street.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.701
That money's got to be in the Cook

15:54.702 --> 15:56.963
County Assessor's
Office within 11 days.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.803
They wouldn't turn
you out, would they?

16:03.129 --> 16:07.054
Shit. What's one more old nigger
to the Board of Education?

16:09.469 --> 16:12.939
Curtis, you and the Penguin
are the only family we got.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.275
You're the only one that
was ever good to us

16:16.392 --> 16:20.397
singing Elmore James tunes and
blowing the harp for us down here.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.278
Well, the sister was right.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.906
You boys could use a
little churching up.

16:26.777 --> 16:30.994
Slide on down to the Triple
Rock and catch Rev. Cleophus.

16:31.574 --> 16:34.293
You boys listen to
what he's got to say.

16:35.286 --> 16:36.333
Curtis,

16:38.664 --> 16:40.758
I don't want to listen
to no jive-ass preacher

16:40.833 --> 16:43.211
talking to me about
heaven and hell.

16:43.294 --> 16:46.514
Jake, you get wise.
You get to church.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.144
All I'm saying is we
got to figure out

17:06.145 --> 17:08.156
some way to get that
money honestly.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.122
That could be a problem.

17:11.821 --> 17:13.199
It's like the Penguin says.

17:13.324 --> 17:15.542
We've got to make that
move towards redemption.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.037
We got to go to church.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.913
We've got to make that
move towards redemption.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.417
We got to go to church.

17:20.498 --> 17:21.965
Bullshit.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.166
Come on.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.783
And now, this week's sermon

17:46.857 --> 17:50.031
is from our beloved, the
Rev. Cleophus James.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.408
James.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.743
- Come on, Reverend.
- Come on, preacher.

17:57.868 --> 17:59.165
And now, people.

17:59.287 --> 18:00.584
Take your time.

18:01.581 --> 18:02.878
And now, people.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.048
When I woke up this morning

18:08.212 --> 18:09.964
I heard a disturbing sound.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.557
Yeah.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.593
I said, when I woke
up this morning

18:15.219 --> 18:17.722
I heard a disturbing sound.

18:18.889 --> 18:22.018
What I heard was the jingle-jangle

18:22.560 --> 18:24.562
of a thousand lost souls.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.900
I'm talking about the souls
of mortal men and women

18:29.358 --> 18:30.951
departed from this life.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.121
Wait a minute.

18:34.405 --> 18:38.911
Those lost, anguished souls
roaming unseen over the earth,

18:40.453 --> 18:42.581
seeking the divine light

18:42.705 --> 18:46.380
they'll not find,
because it's too late.

18:47.460 --> 18:51.636
Too late. Yeah. Too late
for them to ever see again

18:52.089 --> 18:56.435
the light they once chose
not to follow. All right.

18:56.886 --> 18:59.389
Don't be lost when
your time comes.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.767
"For the day of the Lord cometh

19:04.101 --> 19:06.103
"as a thief in the night."

19:06.937 --> 19:09.907
Amen.

19:10.941 --> 19:12.818
Say Amen.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.703
Can I get Amen?

24:30.511 --> 24:34.023
They split. They all
took straight jobs.

24:34.098 --> 24:36.442
Yeah? So you know where they are.

24:36.558 --> 24:39.027
You said you were keeping
in touch with them.

24:39.895 --> 24:44.366
I got a couple of leads,
a few phone numbers.

24:44.441 --> 24:47.445
But I mean, how many of them
visited or even wrote you, huh?

24:47.569 --> 24:50.618
They're not the kind of
guys who write letters.

24:50.948 --> 24:53.792
You were outside. I was inside.

24:53.909 --> 24:57.209
You were supposed to keep
in touch with the band.

24:57.287 --> 25:00.257
I kept asking you if we
were gonna play again.

25:01.125 --> 25:04.720
What was I gonna do, take
away your only hope?

25:05.421 --> 25:08.425
Take away the very thing that
kept you going in there?

25:08.924 --> 25:11.643
I took the liberty of
bullshitting you. Okay?

25:11.760 --> 25:13.228
You lied to me.

25:13.303 --> 25:15.772
It wasn't lies. It
was just bullshit.

25:29.445 --> 25:30.992
What?

25:31.113 --> 25:32.490
Rollers. No.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.241
Yeah.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.864
What? What did I do?

26:13.989 --> 26:15.866
You failed to stop
at a red signal.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.368
The light was yellow, sir.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.788
May I see your licence, please?

26:27.878 --> 26:28.970
God damn it.

26:29.046 --> 26:32.050
Man, I haven't been pulled
over in six months.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.847
I bet those cops have got SCMODS.

26:36.553 --> 26:37.725
SCMODS?

26:38.180 --> 26:42.356
State County Municipal
Offender Data System.

27:08.252 --> 27:11.597
Elwood, we show your licence
currently under suspension.

27:11.672 --> 27:13.766
Step out of the car, please.

27:35.112 --> 27:38.368
First you trade the
Cadillac for a microphone.

27:38.369 --> 27:40.793
Then you lie to me about the band.

27:40.909 --> 27:43.378
Now you're gonna put me
right back in the joint.

27:43.453 --> 27:46.206
They're not gonna catch us.
We're on a mission from God.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.466
Elwood.

28:03.473 --> 28:07.228
We are in high-speed pursuit
northbound on Courtland Avenue.

28:07.311 --> 28:10.815
Black-and-white 1974 Dodge
sedan with Illinois plates.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.657
Request assistance.

28:37.507 --> 28:40.932
We'll be all right if we can
just get back on the expressway.

28:41.845 --> 28:44.439
This don't look like
no expressway to me.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.273
Don't yell at me.

28:48.352 --> 28:50.696
What do you want me
to do, motorhead?

28:51.021 --> 28:53.023
Try not to be so
negative all the time.

28:53.106 --> 28:55.700
Why don't you offer some
constructive criticism?

29:00.781 --> 29:02.875
You got us into this
parking lot, pal.

29:02.950 --> 29:04.497
Now you get us out.

29:04.952 --> 29:08.673
You want out of this
parking lot? Okay.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.174
Will there be anything else?

29:11.250 --> 29:13.173
Yes. Do you have a Miss Piggy?

29:32.479 --> 29:33.981
There's Hanson Burgers.

29:34.064 --> 29:36.317
Yeah, lots of space in this mall.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.756
Disco pants and haircuts.

29:50.831 --> 29:51.878
Yeah.

30:19.109 --> 30:20.782
Baby clothes.

30:21.028 --> 30:23.201
This place has got everything.

30:36.793 --> 30:39.171
New Oldsmobiles are
in early this year.

30:59.816 --> 31:01.739
Pier 1 imports.

31:55.372 --> 31:57.466
They broke my watch.

31:57.541 --> 31:59.964
I'm gonna catch that sucker

32:00.043 --> 32:02.842
if it's the last thing I ever do.

34:54.175 --> 34:55.927
Nice place, huh?

35:48.480 --> 35:49.777
Hey, Sam.

36:02.410 --> 36:03.912
Hey, Lloyd.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.963
Anybody call for me on the phone?

36:06.122 --> 36:07.465
No. No calls.

36:07.749 --> 36:11.970
Some guy left this card.
Cop. Said he'd be back.

36:21.763 --> 36:25.358
This here's my brother, Jake.
He just got out of the joint.

36:25.433 --> 36:28.277
He's gonna be staying
with me for a few weeks.

36:28.353 --> 36:29.775
Yeah. Okay.

36:31.940 --> 36:34.864
Did you get me my Cheez Whiz, boy?

36:56.965 --> 36:59.514
Well, it ain't much,
but it's home.

37:00.885 --> 37:02.746
How often does the train go by?

37:02.747 --> 37:04.890
So often you won't even notice it.

37:33.376 --> 37:36.888
- What are you doing?
- Making dinner. Want some?

37:37.464 --> 37:38.716
No.

37:42.177 --> 37:44.771
Tomorrow we got to get
the band back together.

37:45.054 --> 37:47.557
I'm gonna quit work in the
morning, first thing.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.360
And how are you going to get
to work, Mr. Lead Foot,

37:50.435 --> 37:51.732
Mr. Hot Redder,

37:51.895 --> 37:53.363
Mr. Motor Head?

37:53.438 --> 37:55.611
Those cops took your licence away.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.154
They got your name, your address.

37:57.233 --> 37:58.610
No, they don't got my address.

37:58.735 --> 38:02.410
I falsified my renewal. I
put down 1060 West Addison.

38:04.991 --> 38:06.584
1060 West Addison?

38:09.996 --> 38:11.919
That's Wrigley Field.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.426
I gotta hit the sack.

38:19.672 --> 38:21.766
Hey, you sleaze. My bed.

40:11.034 --> 40:14.254
This, gentlemen, is the elegant
abode of one Elwood Blues.

40:14.329 --> 40:16.423
Thanks for your help, Mr. Mercer.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.633
I kind of like the
Wrigley Field bit.

40:18.708 --> 40:20.631
Yeah, real cute.

40:29.218 --> 40:30.720
All right, Sam?

40:42.398 --> 40:44.901
Hi, has my friend arrived yet?

40:44.984 --> 40:46.657
Failed to report in yesterday.

40:46.819 --> 40:48.446
I don't want no trouble.

40:48.738 --> 40:51.708
You just tell us where they are
and there'll be no trouble.

41:06.255 --> 41:07.598
Stand back.

41:52.635 --> 41:55.730
It's almost 9:00. We've
gotta go to work.

42:51.819 --> 42:53.571
Well, Elwood, sit down.

42:54.697 --> 42:55.949
What's on your mind?

42:56.365 --> 42:57.787
I got to quit.

42:58.701 --> 43:00.374
Why is that, Elwood?

43:02.163 --> 43:04.006
I'm going to become a priest.

43:12.006 --> 43:13.349
Well, okay.

43:14.050 --> 43:17.562
Listen, I'll call payroll and have
them get your severance pay ready.

43:22.391 --> 43:23.563
Good luck.

43:23.684 --> 43:27.022
- God bless you, sir.
- Well, thank you.

43:40.910 --> 43:42.162
What's this?

43:42.328 --> 43:45.423
This is the last known address

43:46.040 --> 43:49.044
of "Bones" Malone and
"Blue Lou" Marini.

43:52.797 --> 43:55.095
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

43:56.509 --> 43:57.726
Yeah.

44:40.595 --> 44:41.847
Mrs. Toronto?

44:41.971 --> 44:43.268
Tarantino.

44:44.015 --> 44:48.020
Ma'am, do you have a Thomas Malone
or Louis Marini living here?

44:49.270 --> 44:51.944
Not anymore. They moved
out a long time ago.

44:52.607 --> 44:55.281
I don't take in boarders,
not for a long time.

44:56.444 --> 44:59.205
- May we come in, ma'am?
- Please.

45:10.249 --> 45:12.593
Did they leave a forwarding
address? A phone number?

45:12.668 --> 45:13.715
No.

45:14.253 --> 45:17.302
Did they live quietly? What
were their personal habits?

45:17.590 --> 45:19.183
They were good boys

45:19.342 --> 45:22.095
but they made a lot
of racket at night.

45:23.221 --> 45:24.848
Are you the police?

45:25.014 --> 45:26.641
No, ma'am. We're musicians.

45:29.644 --> 45:30.896
Mr. Man.

45:31.103 --> 45:32.480
Mr. Man.

45:33.356 --> 45:34.858
Mr. Man.

45:36.525 --> 45:37.651
Yes, ma'am?

45:37.735 --> 45:40.238
They left this card.
Maybe it'll help you?

45:54.210 --> 45:55.553
Thanks.

46:55.479 --> 46:57.698
Thank you. You're marvellous.

46:59.233 --> 47:00.359
You're marvellous. Thank you.

47:00.443 --> 47:02.445
I'm Murph, and these
are the Magic Tones.

47:02.653 --> 47:05.031
Steve "The Colonel" Cropper,
Donald "Duck" Dunn,

47:05.114 --> 47:08.243
Willie "Too Big" Hall
and Tom "Bones" Malone.

47:08.409 --> 47:10.871
We'll be back for the
Armada Room's two-hour

47:10.872 --> 47:13.168
disco swing party after
this short break.

47:13.247 --> 47:15.341
Till then, don't you go changing.

47:19.962 --> 47:24.138
So, Jake, you're out. You're
free. You're rehabilitated.

47:24.216 --> 47:27.220
What's next? What's
happening? What you gonna do?

47:27.303 --> 47:29.647
You got the money you
owe us, motherfucker?

47:29.722 --> 47:31.975
Look, let's just get
something straight here...

47:32.058 --> 47:34.652
The reason he got locked in
the slam in the first place

47:34.727 --> 47:37.731
was for sticking up a gas
station to cover you guys.

47:38.064 --> 47:39.566
You're kidding.

47:39.648 --> 47:42.447
He pulled that job to pay for
the band's room-service tab

47:42.526 --> 47:45.029
from that Kiwanis
gig in Coal City.

47:45.112 --> 47:47.035
You did? That's right.

47:47.156 --> 47:50.501
So I don't want to hear anymore
of this small-change shit.

47:50.659 --> 47:52.912
We're putting the
band back together.

47:55.915 --> 47:58.543
Now, who here at this table

47:59.377 --> 48:03.798
can honestly say that
they played any finer

48:04.006 --> 48:05.938
or felt any better
than they did than

48:05.939 --> 48:07.972
when they were with
the Blues Brothers?

48:11.180 --> 48:12.807
You were the backbone.

48:13.307 --> 48:16.561
The nerve centre of a great
rhythm-and-blues band.

48:17.228 --> 48:20.402
You can make that live,
breathe and jump again.

48:21.690 --> 48:23.738
"Murph and the Magic Tones?"

48:23.818 --> 48:27.038
Look at you in those
candy-ass monkey suits.

48:27.238 --> 48:29.707
And I thought I had
it bad in Joliet.

48:29.782 --> 48:31.955
At least we got a change
in clothes, sucker.

48:32.034 --> 48:34.958
You're wearing the same shit
you had on three years ago.

48:35.329 --> 48:36.455
Jake ain't lying.

48:36.539 --> 48:40.214
We had a band powerful enough to
turn goat piss into gasoline.

48:40.292 --> 48:42.266
We'll never get that
fat sound again.

48:42.267 --> 48:43.796
Not without some more horns.

48:43.879 --> 48:45.677
We'll never get Mr. Fabulous.

48:45.756 --> 48:47.303
Where is he? Forget it.

48:47.383 --> 48:50.557
Mr. Fabulous is the top
maitre d' at the Chez Paul.

48:50.636 --> 48:52.058
He's pulling down
six bills a week.

48:52.138 --> 48:53.811
Matt Murphy got married.

48:53.931 --> 48:55.649
Where is Matt "Guitar" Murphy?

48:55.724 --> 48:57.154
He opened a soul food restaurant

48:57.155 --> 48:58.853
with his old lady
on Maxwell Street.

48:58.936 --> 49:00.358
And he took Blue Lou with him.

49:00.438 --> 49:02.866
You'll never get Matt
and Mr. Fabulous

49:02.867 --> 49:04.734
out of them high-paying gigs.

49:05.526 --> 49:06.903
Oh, yeah?

49:08.070 --> 49:12.666
Well, me and the Lord,
we got an understanding.

49:13.033 --> 49:15.161
We're on a mission from God.

49:27.923 --> 49:29.800
Mainly French cuisine.

49:30.509 --> 49:32.932
No, sir. Mayor Daley
no longer dines here.

49:33.012 --> 49:34.264
He's dead, sir.

49:35.598 --> 49:38.147
Private dining rooms
are available.

49:39.477 --> 49:41.946
Oh, no. I thought it was
supposed to be 5 years.

49:42.021 --> 49:44.774
Didn't you get 5 years?
No, sir, not you.

49:45.024 --> 49:46.776
And your name, sir?

49:46.859 --> 49:51.285
Rizzolo, for 8 at
11:30. Thank you.

49:53.449 --> 49:56.373
Mr. Fabulous, how marvellous
it is to see you.

49:56.452 --> 49:57.874
You're looking younger than ever.

49:57.953 --> 49:59.546
Wait. You guys can't come in here.

49:59.622 --> 50:01.624
Oh, nonsense, my dear fellow.

50:01.832 --> 50:03.880
My brother and I have come to dine

50:04.001 --> 50:07.722
to celebrate my early release
from the service of the state.

50:07.796 --> 50:09.264
Wait. Let's talk outside.

50:09.340 --> 50:10.762
Let's have a cup
of coffee outside.

50:10.841 --> 50:12.309
Why, heavens, no.

50:12.384 --> 50:15.058
We seek a full meal and all
the compliments of the house.

50:15.137 --> 50:16.684
Come, Elwood.

50:16.764 --> 50:19.142
Let us adjourn ourselves
to the nearest table

50:19.225 --> 50:22.320
and overlook this
establishment's board of fare.

50:24.104 --> 50:26.653
Good evening. Chez
Paul. Wait. Hey.

50:27.107 --> 50:30.407
Sir, do you mind calling back
in about five minutes, please?

50:53.050 --> 50:55.269
I'm sure, we'll have a table
for you in just a few moments.

51:02.101 --> 51:03.523
Excuse me, won't you?

51:03.602 --> 51:06.276
Give us a bottle of
your finest champagne,

51:06.438 --> 51:09.692
five shrimp cocktails and
some bread for my brother.

51:09.858 --> 51:12.953
We have a Dom Perignon,
'71, at $120.

51:13.821 --> 51:15.619
That'll be fine, pal.

51:20.411 --> 51:23.210
Come on. Seriously, you guys, the
food here is really expensive.

51:23.289 --> 51:24.882
The soup is fucking $10.

51:24.957 --> 51:28.382
Come on. Let's go outside.
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

51:28.460 --> 51:30.633
We're putting the
band back together.

51:30.713 --> 51:32.215
Forget it. No way.

51:32.298 --> 51:33.800
We're on a mission from God.

51:35.301 --> 51:37.224
Hold it, hold it. What's this?

51:37.636 --> 51:39.058
Waiter? Sir?

51:39.555 --> 51:41.148
Please, waiter?

51:44.310 --> 51:46.312
Yes, sir? How are your salads?

51:46.478 --> 51:48.480
The salads are fine.

51:48.647 --> 51:53.153
It's just that we'd like
to move to another table,

51:53.235 --> 51:55.488
away from those two gentlemen.

51:56.071 --> 51:58.887
Why? Have they been
disturbing you?

51:58.888 --> 51:59.888
No.

51:59.992 --> 52:04.748
It's just that, well, frankly,
they're offensive... smelling.

52:04.955 --> 52:07.708
I mean, they smell bad.

52:10.711 --> 52:13.339
Excuse me, sir. I'll see if I can
locate another table for you.

52:13.464 --> 52:14.966
Thank you.

52:26.352 --> 52:27.979
Wrong glass, sir.

53:19.154 --> 53:21.077
How much for the little girl?

53:21.407 --> 53:23.830
The women? How much for the women?

53:23.909 --> 53:24.956
What?

53:25.035 --> 53:27.129
Your women, I want
to buy your women.

53:27.204 --> 53:29.002
The little girl. Your daughters.

53:29.081 --> 53:30.458
Sell them to me.

53:30.541 --> 53:31.793
Sell me your children.

53:31.875 --> 53:33.752
Maitre d'. Maitre d'.

53:41.176 --> 53:42.644
Hey, cut it out, cut it out.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.768
The owners are gonna ask
me to call the cops.

53:44.847 --> 53:46.849
You wouldn't do that
to me, would you, man?

53:46.932 --> 53:48.400
He just got out of Joliet.

53:48.475 --> 53:49.522
He's on parole.

53:49.601 --> 53:51.700
You can't call the
cops on him, man.

53:51.701 --> 53:53.856
We're putting the
band back together.

53:53.939 --> 53:56.442
I said no. Absolutely not.

53:58.736 --> 54:00.613
You. How much for your wife?

54:03.574 --> 54:05.372
We're putting the
band back together.

54:05.451 --> 54:07.374
We need you, man.
We need your horn.

54:07.453 --> 54:09.046
I can't. I really can't.

54:09.121 --> 54:11.066
We got everybody except
Matt "Guitar" Murphy

54:11.067 --> 54:12.882
and Blue Lou and we're
getting them next.

54:12.958 --> 54:13.959
No way.

54:19.131 --> 54:22.267
If you say no, Elwood and I
will come here for breakfast,

54:22.342 --> 54:24.970
lunch and dinner every
day of the week.

54:29.266 --> 54:31.519
Okay, okay. I'll play. You got me.

54:52.748 --> 54:54.091
White men.

54:55.125 --> 54:56.627
White women.

54:57.586 --> 55:01.432
The swastika is calling you.

55:02.716 --> 55:06.766
The sacred and ancient
symbol of your race

55:07.805 --> 55:10.729
since the beginning of time.

55:12.017 --> 55:15.692
The Jew is using the black

55:16.563 --> 55:19.407
as muscle against you.

55:20.818 --> 55:24.448
And you are left there, helpless.

55:24.613 --> 55:26.911
Fuck you. Why don't you
go back where you belong?

55:26.990 --> 55:29.243
What are you gonna
do about it, Whitey?

55:30.869 --> 55:32.496
Just sit there?

55:32.621 --> 55:34.294
Go back where you came from.

55:34.414 --> 55:35.916
Of course not.

55:36.500 --> 55:38.218
Son of a bitch.

55:38.293 --> 55:40.136
You are going to join with us,

55:41.255 --> 55:47.262
the members of the American
Socialist White People's Party.'

55:48.554 --> 55:51.774
an organisation of decent,

55:52.182 --> 55:54.856
law-abiding white folk

55:55.477 --> 55:57.150
just like you.

55:58.188 --> 56:00.065
Blow it out your
ass, you bastards.

56:00.357 --> 56:02.075
Go to hell.

56:02.150 --> 56:03.993
I pledge allegiance
to Adolf Hitler.

56:04.069 --> 56:06.618
I pledge allegiance
to Adolf Hitler.

56:06.822 --> 56:08.449
The immortal leader of our race.

56:08.574 --> 56:10.167
The immortal leader of our race.

56:10.284 --> 56:12.036
To the order for which he stands.

56:12.119 --> 56:14.121
And to the order for
which he stands.

56:14.204 --> 56:16.707
One great cause. One great cause.

56:16.790 --> 56:19.543
Sacred and invincible.
Sacred and invincible.

56:19.751 --> 56:21.253
Hey, what's going on?

56:22.296 --> 56:25.766
Those bums won their court case,
so they're marching today.

56:25.841 --> 56:26.967
What bums?

56:27.050 --> 56:28.848
The fucking Nazi Party.

56:29.344 --> 56:31.438
Illinois Nazis.

56:33.724 --> 56:35.726
I hate Illinois Nazis.

56:36.059 --> 56:37.936
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

56:45.819 --> 56:46.991
Ten hut.

57:01.168 --> 57:02.168
Gruppenführer.

57:02.210 --> 57:03.257
Yes, sir.

57:03.670 --> 57:07.220
Gruppenführer, get that
car's licence plate number.

57:07.507 --> 57:09.805
We're gonna kill
that son of a bitch.

That was Boom Boom, the song
that I wrote, back in the '50s.

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:04.063
No, you didn't.

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:05.481
Was such a big hit.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.278
No, you didn't. No, you didn't.

01:00:07.813 --> 01:00:10.066
I wrote Boom Boom.
I wrote Boom Boom.

01:00:21.326 --> 01:00:22.623
Can I help you, boys?

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:24.170
You got any white bread?

01:00:24.246 --> 01:00:25.293
Yes.

01:00:25.664 --> 01:00:28.508
I'll have some toasted
white bread, please.

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:32.967
You want butter or jam
on that toast, honey?

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:34.423
No, ma'am. Dry.

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:37.346
Got any fried chicken?

01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:39.699
Best damn chicken in the state.

01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:42.731
Bring me four fried
chickens and a Coke.

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:45.997
You want chicken wings
or chicken legs?

01:00:45.998 --> 01:00:48.107
Four fried chickens and a Coke.

01:00:48.228 --> 01:00:50.196
And some dry white toast, please.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:53.023
You all want anything
to drink with that?

01:00:53.025 --> 01:00:54.280
- No, ma'am.
- A Coke.

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:55.576
Be up in a minute.

01:00:56.736 --> 01:00:58.534
We got two honkies out there

01:00:58.613 --> 01:01:00.581
dressed like Hasidic
diamond merchants.

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:02.038
Say what?

01:01:02.117 --> 01:01:04.495
They look like they're
from the CIA or something.

01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:05.750
What they wanna eat?

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:09.584
The tall one wants
white bread. Toast.

01:01:09.749 --> 01:01:11.217
Dry. With nothing on it.

01:01:11.293 --> 01:01:12.340
Elwood.

01:01:12.586 --> 01:01:16.841
And the other one wants four
whole fried chickens and a Coke.

01:01:16.965 --> 01:01:19.184
And Jake. Shit. The
Blues Brothers.

01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:20.893
Hi, Jake.

01:01:20.969 --> 01:01:22.596
Matt. How you doing?

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:24.226
How you doing? How was Joliet?

01:01:24.306 --> 01:01:25.432
Oh, it's bad.

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:27.768
On Thursday night they serve
a wicked pepper steak.

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:29.552
Can't be as bad as
the cabbage rolls

01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:31.024
at the Terre Haute Federal Pen.

01:01:31.146 --> 01:01:34.866
Or that oatmeal at the Cook County
Slammer. They're all pretty bad.

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:36.993
Matt. Me and Elwood,

01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:39.536
we're putting the band back

01:01:39.537 --> 01:01:41.660
together. We need
you and Blue Lou.

01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:43.579
Oh, man. Don't talk
that way around here.

01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:45.126
My old lady, she'll kill me.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.454
Ma'am, you gotta understand.

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:48.789
This is a lot bigger than
any domestic problems

01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:50.294
you might be experiencing.

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:52.561
Matt, what the hell
is he talking about?

01:01:52.562 --> 01:01:53.884
Don't get riled, sugar.

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:55.800
Don't you, "don't get
riled, sugar" me.

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:57.927
Now, you not going back
on the road no more.

01:01:58.006 --> 01:02:00.634
And you ain't playing any
more two-bit, sleazy dives.

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:04.433
You're living with me now. And
you're not gonna go sliding around

01:02:04.512 --> 01:02:06.230
with your old white
hoodlum friends.

01:02:06.348 --> 01:02:08.692
But, babes. This is
Jake and Elwood.

01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:10.064
The Blues Brothers.

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:13.279
The Blues Brothers.

01:02:15.649 --> 01:02:18.323
They still owe you money, fool.

01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:21.742
Ma'am, would it make you feel
any better if you knew that

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:24.700
what we're asking Matt here
to do is a holy thing?

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.170
You see, we're on a
mission from God.

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:31.044
Don't you blaspheme in here.
Don't you blaspheme in here.

01:02:31.122 --> 01:02:33.625
Now, this is my man,
this is my restaurant,

01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:36.006
and you two are gonna just
walk right out that door,

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:40.057
without your dry, white toast,
without your four fried chickens

01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:42.179
and without Matt "Guitar" Murphy.

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:44.353
Now, you listen to me. I love you.

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.350
But I'm the man and
you're the woman.

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:48.557
And I'll make the decisions
concerning my life.

01:02:48.682 --> 01:02:50.400
You better think about
what you saying.

01:02:50.517 --> 01:02:53.020
You better think about the
consequences of your actions.

01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:54.400

Well, go ahead, damn it.

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.120
Shit.

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:58.414
Pardon me, but we do
have a strict policy

01:07:58.415 --> 01:08:00.868
concerning the handling
of the instruments.

01:08:00.952 --> 01:08:04.957
An employee of Ray's Music
Exchange must be present.

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:07.088
Now, may I help you?

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:09.965
Ray, it's me. Joliet Jake.

01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:13.636
I once rented some column
speakers from you for my band,

01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:15.012
The Blues Brothers.

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:17.719
Hey, Ray. It's me, Murph, of
Murph and the Magic Tones.

01:08:17.801 --> 01:08:19.520
Remember me? I bought
three Fender amps.

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.644
Oh, we sell a lot of amplifiers.

01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:23.600
Not like these. They
were beautiful.

01:08:23.725 --> 01:08:25.853
Upholstered with thick, red shag.

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.154
Oh, right, right. I remember now.

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:31.028
As a matter of fact, I'll buy
them all back for $350 a piece.

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:32.198
$350?

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:34.823
I paid $800 each,
not 6 months ago.

01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:37.621
Well, you know depreciation, man.

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:40.287
Ray, we're here to buy stuff.

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:43.082
We need pianos, amps,
mikes, the works.

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:47.044
Now, go on. Get.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:54.176
Breaks my heart, a boy
that young going bad.

01:08:56.591 --> 01:08:58.764
Tell me a little about
this electric piano, Ray.

01:08:58.843 --> 01:09:00.765
Oh, you have a good eye, my man.

01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:02.939
That's the best in
the city of Chicago.

01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:04.060
How much?

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:07.109
$2,000 and it's yours. You
can take it home with you.

01:09:07.225 --> 01:09:09.319
Matter of fact, I'll throw
in the black keys for free.

01:09:09.437 --> 01:09:11.939
$2,000 for this chunk of shit?

01:09:12.273 --> 01:09:13.616
Come on, Ray.

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:17.742
I mean, really, Ray. It's used.

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:20.288
There's no action left
in this keyboard.

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:28.296
Excuse me.

01:09:28.372 --> 01:09:30.442
I don't think there's
anything wrong

01:09:30.443 --> 01:09:32.176

We'll take these axes.

01:12:05.238 --> 01:12:08.788
Naturally. And as usual,
I gotta take an IOU.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.829
You guys go inside, get
yourselves a bite.

01:12:46.946 --> 01:12:48.823
I've got to make a phone call.

01:12:48.948 --> 01:12:52.043
Now, Jake, does this phone
call concern our first gig?

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.953
Have I ever lied to you?

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:03.588
What are we gonna do, man?

01:13:03.671 --> 01:13:04.888
We don't got no gig.

01:13:04.964 --> 01:13:06.511
How much money you got?

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:08.135
I got a quarter.

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:10.686
That's enough for a
phone call. Come on.

01:13:19.353 --> 01:13:21.026
What are you doing, Elwood?

01:13:21.105 --> 01:13:22.732
You said we were
gonna make a call.

01:13:22.857 --> 01:13:24.575
I said I was gonna make a call.

01:13:24.692 --> 01:13:26.365
Who are you gonna call, Jake?

01:13:26.485 --> 01:13:28.237
Do you remember Maury Sline?

01:13:28.362 --> 01:13:30.911
Sline? Booking agent?
What about him?

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:33.826
He got us some good
showcases in the old days.

01:13:34.035 --> 01:13:36.879
He got us the Morgan Park,
he got us the Tick Took.

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:39.090
I got him laid. He owes me.

01:13:39.999 --> 01:13:41.251
Give it a shot.

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:11.159
Hey, Jake.

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:14.451
There's got to be at least
$7 worth of change here.

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:24.085
Yeah?

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:25.552
Sir.

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:29.883
What did you find out?

01:14:29.966 --> 01:14:31.058
Okay.

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:33.852
I called a friend at the
Motor Vehicle Department.

01:14:33.928 --> 01:14:37.148
That licence plate is like a
rash all over the computer.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:40.067
The car belongs to a
known traffic menace.

01:14:40.559 --> 01:14:41.685
What's his name?

01:14:41.769 --> 01:14:43.066
His name is Elwood Blues.

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:45.364
He's got a record a mile long.

01:14:46.023 --> 01:14:47.366
And he's a Catholic.

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:50.911
- Did you get his address?
- Of course.

01:14:50.987 --> 01:14:52.705
1060 West Addison.

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:55.453
Let's go.

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:12.808
Anybody with that kind of
record is gonna make a mistake.

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:16.328
I want all party members
in the tri-state

01:15:16.329 --> 01:15:18.727
district to monitor
the city, county,

01:15:18.806 --> 01:15:20.774
and state police on their C.B's.

01:15:22.101 --> 01:15:24.024
Mr. Blues is gonna fuck up.

01:15:24.645 --> 01:15:26.147
And when he does,

01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:29.905
he better pray the police
get to him before we do.

01:15:38.993 --> 01:15:40.040
All right, man.

01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:41.754
We've been in this car
for three hours now.

01:15:41.829 --> 01:15:43.126
Where the hell is this place?

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:46.254
I told you it'd take a
little while to get there.

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:47.676
What's the name of the place?

01:15:47.793 --> 01:15:51.673
The name of the place is,

01:15:54.175 --> 01:15:55.552
Bob's Country Bunker.

01:15:55.676 --> 01:15:57.098
Here we are.

01:15:57.178 --> 01:15:58.725
Bob's Country Bunker?

01:16:16.363 --> 01:16:18.286
Jake, the sign says,

01:16:18.365 --> 01:16:19.833
"Tonight only, the Good Ole Boys."

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:21.161
Blues Brothers.

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:23.416
It should read, "Tonight only,

01:16:23.537 --> 01:16:26.006
"the Blues Brothers'
triumphant return."

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:28.380
Must be some kind of mistake.

01:16:28.459 --> 01:16:30.006
You guys unload the stuff.

01:16:30.377 --> 01:16:31.879
Elwood, come with me.

01:16:54.652 --> 01:16:56.700
What can I get you boys?

01:16:56.779 --> 01:16:59.157
You thirsty, you hungry
or just driving through?

01:16:59.406 --> 01:17:01.875
Maybe you'd like a beer, or
something a little harder?

01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:04.704
We happen to make the
state's best pepper steak.

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:06.539
No, thank you, ma'am.

01:17:06.789 --> 01:17:09.633
We may be sucking back a few
beers a little later on.

01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:12.461
We'll be here all night.
You see, we're the band.

01:17:12.628 --> 01:17:15.598
You are? Oh, gee, that's nice.

01:17:15.714 --> 01:17:17.933
Hey, Bob, this is the band.

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:19.426
All right.

01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:23.143
What kind of music do
you usually have here?

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:26.309
We got both kinds. We got
country and western.

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:33.107
Jake, are you sure
this is the place?

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:35.659
Yeah. Sure. This is the place.

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:43.580
Hi. You the Good Ole
Boys? That's us.

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:45.878
The rest of the band's
out in the parking lot

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:47.121
getting our stuff together.

01:17:47.204 --> 01:17:49.298
Well, I'm sure glad to
have you boys here.

01:17:49.373 --> 01:17:51.341
I'm Bob and this here is my place.

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:55.008
It's a beautiful place, Bob.

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:58.348
I guess you wanna get your
steel guitars and everything

01:17:58.424 --> 01:17:59.676
set up on stage, don't you?

01:17:59.758 --> 01:18:01.660
Claire, go and turn
those stage lights

01:18:01.661 --> 01:18:03.513
on and get these
boys going up there.

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:10.857
Chicken wire?

01:18:10.936 --> 01:18:13.030
What do you say we set
up for sound check?

01:18:16.859 --> 01:18:19.157
Excuse me, sonny, I guess
I'll give this to you.

Man, I don't think we know any
of the songs on this list.

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:53.525
This list doesn't mean anything.
They're just requests.

music we've had

01:24:59.553 --> 01:25:01.806
at the Country Bunker
in a long time.

01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:06.102
Sorry we couldn't remember
The Wreck of the Old 97.

01:25:06.226 --> 01:25:07.227
Why, hell.

01:25:07.311 --> 01:25:09.780
You guys can learn it next
time when you come back.

01:25:10.063 --> 01:25:13.283
Bob, about our money for tonight.

01:25:13.567 --> 01:25:14.910
That's right.

01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:20.866
$200 and you boys drank
$300 worth of beer.

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:23.155
When we first came in the bar lady

01:25:23.156 --> 01:25:25.621
never charged us for
the first round

01:25:25.746 --> 01:25:28.215
so, like, we figured beer was
complimentary for the band.

01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:30.191
Beer was, like, complimentary
for the band, you know.

01:25:30.667 --> 01:25:31.919
No.

01:25:33.754 --> 01:25:37.174
Well, I'll just go out and take
up a collection from the boys.

01:25:37.257 --> 01:25:39.931
Well, I'll tell you, I
sure would appreciate it.

01:25:45.932 --> 01:25:48.185
I say this trip is nowhere, man.

01:25:48.435 --> 01:25:49.812
I say we gotta quit.

01:25:50.395 --> 01:25:52.864
What? Quit?

01:25:52.939 --> 01:25:55.192
Well, I wish you guys
would make up your mind.

01:25:55.275 --> 01:25:57.073
Otherwise, I've gotta
call Mr. Ronzini

01:25:57.152 --> 01:25:59.029
at the Holiday Inn and
get our old gig back.

01:25:59.112 --> 01:26:00.830
Back at the Armada Room?

01:26:01.948 --> 01:26:04.792
Listen, they want us to pay
for the beer we drank.

01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:06.332
So you guys better split.

01:26:06.453 --> 01:26:09.753
The next gig is gonna be dynamite.

01:26:10.123 --> 01:26:11.875
Huge. You'll see.

01:26:16.505 --> 01:26:19.929
I say we give The Blues
Brothers just one more chance.

01:26:20.008 --> 01:26:22.511
Why not? If the
shit fits, wear it.

01:26:22.803 --> 01:26:24.305
Scoot over, goddamn it.

01:26:31.353 --> 01:26:33.151
Boys look a little upset.

01:26:34.314 --> 01:26:36.988
Hey, man. Don't worry.
We got a couple of days.

01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:38.986
We'll get the Penguin's tax money.

01:26:39.152 --> 01:26:40.324
I mean, look.

01:26:40.445 --> 01:26:43.244
We got an appointment to

01:26:43.448 --> 01:26:45.246

May I see your cards, please?

01:27:14.646 --> 01:27:16.405
Suppose we ain't got
no union cards and

01:27:16.406 --> 01:27:17.945
we go in and start playing anyway.

01:27:18.024 --> 01:27:19.992
What you gonna do about that?

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:22.321
You gonna stop us? Stein?

01:27:23.363 --> 01:27:25.247
You gonna look pretty
funny trying to eat

01:27:25.248 --> 01:27:26.996

no fucking teeth.

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:29.411
Listen,

01:27:30.537 --> 01:27:33.165
let me talk to Bob, the owner.

01:27:33.331 --> 01:27:36.426
See if we can put your band on
contract waivers for tonight.

01:27:36.543 --> 01:27:39.110
I don't want you to
move from this spot.

01:27:39.111 --> 01:27:40.722
Just let me handle this.

01:27:44.551 --> 01:27:46.474
We'll, We'll talk to Bob.

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:53.026
Get in the car and start her up.

01:27:56.688 --> 01:27:58.357
You know you boys owe
me a lot of money

01:27:58.358 --> 01:27:59.734
for that beer you drank tonight.

01:27:59.816 --> 01:28:00.942

01:28:01.026 --> 01:28:03.199
Bob, we loved playing
here tonight.

01:28:03.278 --> 01:28:06.198
My brother's writing out an
American Express traveller's

01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:07.908
cheque to cover the
extensive bar tab.

01:28:07.991 --> 01:28:09.584
Well, I sure would appreciate it.

01:28:09.701 --> 01:28:11.749
I'd better check up,
see how he's doing.

01:28:11.828 --> 01:28:13.171
See, I have to sign it, too.

01:28:13.246 --> 01:28:15.284
I usually sit in the
car and write it

01:28:15.285 --> 01:28:17.376
out on the, glove compartment lid.

01:28:17.667 --> 01:28:18.668
Okay?

01:28:22.422 --> 01:28:23.799

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:37.688
Union? What the hell union?

01:28:37.771 --> 01:28:40.532
Those boys skipped out of here
owing me a lot of money for beer.

01:28:41.399 --> 01:28:43.527
What the hell are you
guys all dressed up for?

01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:45.112
We're The Good Ole Boys.

01:28:45.737 --> 01:28:47.785
You're The Good Ole Boys?

01:29:07.634 --> 01:29:09.682
A.F.M. Shit.

01:29:45.297 --> 01:29:46.594
I don't believe it.

01:29:46.673 --> 01:29:50.677
It's that shitbox Dodge again.
The bastards are ours now.

01:30:10.363 --> 01:30:13.458
Holy shit.

01:30:23.335 --> 01:30:26.555
Boys, you're in big trouble.

01:30:29.507 --> 01:30:31.805
Maury, you owe me.

01:30:31.885 --> 01:30:34.559
We'll play anywhere,
anytime, for anybody.

01:30:34.638 --> 01:30:35.805
Put us in, the Double Up Lounge,

01:30:36.514 --> 01:30:38.516
or the Morgan Park
Theatre, or the Crystal.

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:41.149
We always knocked them
dead in those joints.

01:30:41.728 --> 01:30:44.402
Discos. They're all discos.

01:30:46.274 --> 01:30:48.777
Singles. Mixed
singles, gay singles.

01:30:49.653 --> 01:30:51.301
Those people like
to tumble and carry

01:30:51.302 --> 01:30:53.035
on. They like to dance
with each other.

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:54.457
We are a dance band.

01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:57.328
I don't know, boys.
I just don't know.

01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:01.089

you know what I mean?

01:31:01.414 --> 01:31:03.291

01:31:03.416 --> 01:31:05.214
You wear the same farchadat suits.

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:07.341
You'll scare people away.

01:31:08.254 --> 01:31:10.592
Don't you ever wear
blue jeans or jumpsuits

01:31:10.593 --> 01:31:12.718
like Wayne Cochran
and the C.C. Riders?

01:31:12.801 --> 01:31:14.769
You gotta come through for us.

01:31:15.428 --> 01:31:17.647
We need $5,000, fast.

01:31:18.765 --> 01:31:20.688
$5,000?

01:31:20.934 --> 01:31:23.278
Who do you think you
are? The Beatles?

01:31:23.770 --> 01:31:25.263
You know the size hall you gotta

01:31:25.264 --> 01:31:26.990
work to take in
that kind of money?

01:31:27.107 --> 01:31:29.610
We'll fill any hall
in the country.

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:34.163
You guys familiar with the
Palace Hotel ballroom?

01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:36.499
Never heard of it.

01:31:36.658 --> 01:31:38.001
Nice place up north.

01:31:38.702 --> 01:31:41.330
Built in the '40s
on Lake Wazapamani.

01:31:41.997 --> 01:31:43.624
That seats 5,000.

01:31:43.707 --> 01:31:46.130
You guys fill that place,
you can make $5,000, easy.

01:31:46.209 --> 01:31:47.677
Book us for tomorrow night.

01:31:47.752 --> 01:31:49.971
Hold it. Tomorrow night?

01:31:50.046 --> 01:31:52.720
A gig like that, you gotta
prepare the proper exploitation.

01:31:52.841 --> 01:31:55.845
I know about that stuff. I
been exploited all my life.

01:31:55.969 --> 01:31:59.143
Forget it. There's no way with
you guys. Forget about it.

01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:04.774
Say, how's Mrs. Sline?

01:32:04.853 --> 01:32:07.652
I might have some information
she'd like to know.

01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:13.737
You blackmailing me?

01:32:14.237 --> 01:32:17.036
If you wanna put it that way.
Maury, we need this gig.

01:32:17.157 --> 01:32:19.000
We're on a mission from God.

01:32:22.495 --> 01:32:24.244
You get us the hall,
and I guarantee

01:32:24.245 --> 01:32:26.041
we'll pack them in
from miles around.

01:32:26.166 --> 01:32:27.713
What do you say?

01:32:29.169 --> 01:32:31.388
Okay. I'll get you
the Palace Hotel.

01:32:32.505 --> 01:32:33.848
I'll print up showbills. I'll make

01:32:33.923 --> 01:32:35.971
the place look real pretty, okay?

01:32:36.051 --> 01:32:38.850
I don't think you guys are
gonna gross dollar one.

01:32:39.512 --> 01:32:42.516
But if you do, I want a
taste of the gate, okay?

01:32:43.224 --> 01:32:44.726
Thanks, Maury. Let's go, boys.

01:32:52.317 --> 01:32:53.819
Listen,

01:32:53.902 --> 01:32:56.496
you boys heard me talk
about Jake and Elwood.

01:32:56.613 --> 01:32:58.991
Well, they used to live
here, just like you.

01:32:59.074 --> 01:33:01.748
And I used to sing to
them, just like with you.

01:33:01.826 --> 01:33:02.873
Tonight,

01:33:02.952 --> 01:33:05.421
Jake and Elwood are going
out to sing and play

01:33:05.497 --> 01:33:07.499
to raise money to
help you children.

01:33:07.582 --> 01:33:09.755
Your lazy butts are in this, too.

01:33:10.335 --> 01:33:12.008
So get up on that wagon.

01:33:12.087 --> 01:33:15.097
We're going up north to put
the word in the streets.

01:34:36.004 --> 01:34:37.130
For $2.

01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:39.474

01:35:24.510 --> 01:35:28.060
"Palace Hotel ballroom.

01:35:29.224 --> 01:35:30.897
How we doing?

01:35:32.352 --> 01:35:36.653
So far we covered Lake, McHenry

01:35:36.981 --> 01:35:38.733
and part of DuPage County.

01:35:39.025 --> 01:35:41.494
Good. Let's get to the gig.

01:35:43.696 --> 01:35:45.573
What is it?

01:35:46.241 --> 01:35:47.743
We're out of gas.

01:35:49.994 --> 01:35:51.712
Oh, shit.

01:36:14.644 --> 01:36:17.363
Wow, a classic. What a room.

01:36:17.605 --> 01:36:19.357
This place is gonna swing tonight.

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.363
It's a fucking barn.
We'll never fill it.

01:36:21.442 --> 01:36:23.734
We've gotta fill this
hall tonight. A lot

01:36:23.735 --> 01:36:25.863
of young children are
depending on it.

01:36:25.947 --> 01:36:28.075
Young children? Why,
what do you mean?

01:36:28.533 --> 01:36:32.208
Jake and Elwood are donating the
band's share of the door money

01:36:32.412 --> 01:36:36.383
to pay the taxes on the Saint
Helen's Orphanage in Calumet City.

01:36:36.791 --> 01:36:37.963
What?

01:36:38.751 --> 01:36:40.549
We're out of gas. Yep.

01:36:40.962 --> 01:36:42.464
Mind if we fill her up?

01:36:42.588 --> 01:36:45.091
Nope. I said we're out of gas.

01:36:45.591 --> 01:36:48.595
Tanker truck's late. Should
have been here two hours ago.

01:36:48.678 --> 01:36:51.227
It's always late on Thursdays.

01:36:53.766 --> 01:36:55.734
I guess we'll have to wait.

01:36:55.810 --> 01:36:57.027
Yeah.

01:37:19.917 --> 01:37:21.885
Excuse me, sir.

01:37:23.755 --> 01:37:25.811
Yes, you. Could you
fill it up with

01:37:25.812 --> 01:37:28.267
premium, please, and
check under the hood?

01:37:31.095 --> 01:37:32.267
Sure.

01:37:32.388 --> 01:37:34.265
You, want I should,

01:37:34.349 --> 01:37:36.101
wash the dead bugs
off the windscreen?

01:37:37.143 --> 01:37:39.066
Oh, no. Don't worry. I'm
in kind of a hurry.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:51.123
Where in the hell are they?

01:37:51.199 --> 01:37:55.787
So, maybe you'd like to
come by and see the show.

01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:57.372
Oh, I'm awfully sorry,

01:37:57.455 --> 01:37:59.799
but I do have a prior
dinner engagement.

01:38:08.299 --> 01:38:10.017
Thanks, Marvin.

01:38:14.305 --> 01:38:16.524
Debbie, get me Troopers
Daniel and Mount.

01:38:24.065 --> 01:38:26.159
I don't see those Blues Brothers.

01:38:26.734 --> 01:38:27.986
We'll wait.

01:38:30.154 --> 01:38:32.532
Okay, you're all set.

01:38:32.615 --> 01:38:35.915
That'll be, $94.

01:38:39.330 --> 01:38:41.003
Here's $95. Thank you, Elwood.

01:38:41.124 --> 01:38:44.344
Okay. And that's $1 change.

01:38:44.419 --> 01:38:45.921
Oh, keep the change.

01:38:46.003 --> 01:38:47.755
Oh, thanks.

01:38:49.841 --> 01:38:53.266
So, look. If your date

01:38:53.344 --> 01:38:55.847
don't work out tonight
for any reason,

01:38:56.597 --> 01:39:00.272
there's a motel up
on the interstate.

01:39:00.852 --> 01:39:04.026
Maybe we could, say, meet

01:39:04.647 --> 01:39:06.695
around, midnight?

01:39:08.526 --> 01:39:10.449
I'll think about it, Elwood, okay?

01:39:12.947 --> 01:39:13.948
Bye.

01:39:29.130 --> 01:39:30.973
Son of a bitch.

01:39:31.799 --> 01:39:33.051
Come on.

01:40:07.335 --> 01:40:08.962
We're really late. You
better step on it, man.

01:40:09.045 --> 01:40:10.171
Yeah.

01:40:18.471 --> 01:40:21.600
I always like to perform
for angry mobs.

01:40:21.933 --> 01:40:23.355
You can't quit now.

01:40:23.559 --> 01:40:25.186
What can they be doing?

01:40:42.745 --> 01:40:44.292
My head hurts.

01:40:45.665 --> 01:40:47.542
That Night Train's a mean wine.

01:40:47.625 --> 01:40:49.548
You'd better get bright.
We got a show to do.

01:40:49.627 --> 01:40:52.471
Then we gotta figure out some
way to collect that gate money,

01:40:52.547 --> 01:40:54.641
get it to the Cook
County Assessor's office

01:40:54.715 --> 01:40:56.592
as soon as they open
in the morning.

01:41:04.433 --> 01:41:08.939
We want the show.

01:41:17.405 --> 01:41:19.453
Gentlemen, I'm leaving.

01:41:20.408 --> 01:41:21.830
Man, we were so close.

01:41:21.909 --> 01:41:24.003
Hey, you guys know
Minnie The Moocher?

01:41:24.078 --> 01:41:26.422

named Minnie Mazola.

01:41:26.497 --> 01:41:28.966
No. The song Minnie the Moocher.

01:41:29.041 --> 01:41:30.167
Yeah. So what?

Who wants an Orange Whip?

01:47:17.014 --> 01:47:18.937
Orange Whip? Orange Whip?

01:47:19.850 --> 01:47:21.318
Three Orange Whips.

01:47:40.579 --> 01:47:41.671
Excuse us.

01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:45.134
Good evening, ladies.

01:48:21.286 --> 01:48:23.630
One, two. One, two, three, four.

01:48:47.438 --> 01:48:48.860
Now, ladies and gentlemen

01:48:48.939 --> 01:48:52.364
it is the distinct pleasure of
the management to present to you

01:48:52.443 --> 01:48:55.447
the evening's star attraction.

01:48:55.529 --> 01:48:59.955
Here they are, back after their
exclusive three-year tour

01:49:00.034 --> 01:49:04.005
of Europe, Scandinavia
and the Subcontinent.

01:49:04.079 --> 01:49:07.834
Won't you welcome, from
Calumet City, Illinois,

01:49:08.208 --> 01:49:13.089
the show band of Joliet
Jake and Elwood Blues.

01:49:13.505 --> 01:49:16.054
The Blues Brothers.

01:49:52.753 --> 01:49:55.006
One, two. One, two, three, four.

01:50:05.682 --> 01:50:08.606
We're so glad to see so many of
you lovely people here tonight.

01:50:08.685 --> 01:50:11.359
We'd especially like to welcome
all the representatives

01:50:11.438 --> 01:50:13.317
of Illinois' law
enforcement community,

01:50:13.318 --> 01:50:14.820
who have chosen to join us here

01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:16.868
in the Palace Hotel
ballroom at this time.

01:50:16.944 --> 01:50:18.946
We certainly hope you
all enjoy the show.

01:50:19.029 --> 01:50:21.031
And remember that no
matter who you are

01:50:21.115 --> 01:50:23.584
and what you do to live,
thrive and survive

01:50:23.659 --> 01:50:26.458

You guys were hot.

01:55:17.786 --> 01:55:20.835
You were great. Insane.
I've got to record you.

01:55:20.914 --> 01:55:22.086
Bullshit.

01:55:22.165 --> 01:55:23.917
Bullshit? I don't bullshit.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.843
I'm president of Clarion Records

01:55:25.919 --> 01:55:28.297
the largest recording company
on the Eastern seaboard.

01:55:28.422 --> 01:55:29.423
So what?

01:55:29.506 --> 01:55:30.849
Here's $10,000.

01:55:30.924 --> 01:55:33.768
An advance on your first
recording session.

01:55:36.346 --> 01:55:37.598
Is it a deal?

01:55:38.432 --> 01:55:40.685
Yeah. Sure, it's a deal.

01:55:40.767 --> 01:55:43.771
Yeah. Sure, it's a deal.

01:55:43.854 --> 01:55:46.690
Listen, all these cops out here,
they're sort of waiting for us.

01:55:46.773 --> 01:55:48.548
We gotta get out
with nobody seeing

01:55:48.549 --> 01:55:50.027
us. You know a back door out?

01:55:50.110 --> 01:55:53.284
Sure. I used to be head bouncer
here back in the '70s.

01:55:53.613 --> 01:55:57.122
There's an electrical service duct
right behind your drummer's riser.

01:55:57.242 --> 01:55:59.165
Do us a favour.

01:55:59.286 --> 01:56:00.458
Take $1,400

01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:03.590
and give it to Ray's Music
Exchange in Calumet City

01:56:03.665 --> 01:56:05.338
and give the rest to the band.

01:56:05.459 --> 01:56:07.086
You got it. Thanks.

01:56:26.438 --> 01:56:28.691
Me and Elwood are gonna
make a break for it.

01:56:28.815 --> 01:56:30.488
You and the band keep playing.

01:56:46.833 --> 01:56:48.005
Something's wrong.

01:56:49.336 --> 01:56:50.428
Where's Jake?

01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:55.934
Where'd those Blues Brothers go?

01:57:09.105 --> 01:57:11.278
I sure hope this thing
leads some place.

01:57:11.358 --> 01:57:13.611
Elwood, we're gone, man.

01:57:22.661 --> 01:57:25.039
Who is that girl?

01:57:25.205 --> 01:57:26.957
Well, Jake.

01:57:27.541 --> 01:57:30.385
You look just fine down there

01:57:30.460 --> 01:57:32.679
slithering in the mud like vermin.

01:57:33.547 --> 01:57:35.549
No problem.

01:57:35.715 --> 01:57:38.309
You're not gonna get
away from me this time.

01:57:43.306 --> 01:57:45.058
Check that out. Let's go.

01:58:04.369 --> 01:58:06.747
It's good to see you, sweetheart.

01:58:08.164 --> 01:58:10.166
You contemptable pig.

01:58:11.835 --> 01:58:14.509
I remained celibate for you.

01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:18.054
I stood at the back of a cathedral

01:58:18.216 --> 01:58:20.639
waiting, in celibacy, for you

01:58:20.719 --> 01:58:23.973
with 300 friends and
relatives in attendance.

01:58:24.639 --> 01:58:27.813
My uncle hired the best
Romanian caterers in the state.

01:58:27.892 --> 01:58:30.395
To obtain the seven limousines
for the wedding party

01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:33.819
my father used up his last
favours with Mad Pete Trullo.

01:58:34.566 --> 01:58:37.490
So for me, for my mother,

01:58:37.652 --> 01:58:39.700
my grandmother, my
father, my uncle,

01:58:39.779 --> 01:58:41.201
and for the common good

01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:44.869
I must now kill you
and your brother.

01:58:58.923 --> 01:59:01.972
Oh, please don't kill us.

01:59:02.052 --> 01:59:03.679
Please, please, don't kill us.

01:59:03.762 --> 01:59:05.184
You know I love you, baby.

01:59:05.263 --> 01:59:07.436
I wouldn't leave you.
It wasn't my fault.

01:59:07.515 --> 01:59:09.358
You miserable slug.

01:59:09.434 --> 01:59:11.687
You think you can talk
your way out of this?

01:59:11.770 --> 01:59:12.942
You betrayed me.

01:59:13.355 --> 01:59:15.949
No, I didn't. Honest.

01:59:16.399 --> 01:59:17.946
I ran out of gas.

01:59:18.026 --> 01:59:19.369
I had a flat tyre.

01:59:19.444 --> 01:59:21.117
I didn't have enough
money for cab fare.

01:59:21.237 --> 01:59:23.285
My tux didn't come back
from the cleaners.

01:59:23.365 --> 01:59:25.367
And old friend came
in from out of town.

01:59:25.450 --> 01:59:27.293
Someone stole my car.

01:59:27.369 --> 01:59:29.713
There was an earthquake.
A terrible flood.

01:59:29.788 --> 01:59:32.883
Locusts. It wasn't my fault,

01:59:32.957 --> 01:59:35.085
I swear to God.

01:59:53.895 --> 01:59:55.112
Oh, Jake...

01:59:58.066 --> 01:59:59.534
Jake, honey.

02:00:12.622 --> 02:00:13.794
Let's go.

02:00:18.253 --> 02:00:19.630
Take it easy.

02:00:34.728 --> 02:00:36.856
You're going to totally
demolish the cars.

02:00:39.774 --> 02:00:43.904
You want to maybe consider going
after the Blues Brothers?

02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:56.424
It's 106 miles to Chicago.

02:00:56.541 --> 02:00:59.340
We got a full tank of gas,
half a pack of cigarettes,

02:00:59.419 --> 02:01:02.093
it's dark, and we're
wearing sunglasses.

02:01:02.213 --> 02:01:03.260
Hit it.

02:01:47.634 --> 02:01:51.264
Shit, man. Can't this damn
thing go any faster than this?

02:01:51.596 --> 02:01:53.849
Bob, I think I've got
a little problem.

02:01:56.309 --> 02:01:58.277
Goddamn, boy.

02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:52.783
Don't you say a fucking word.

02:03:33.406 --> 02:03:35.329
All units, we have a signal 10-79.

02:03:35.408 --> 02:03:36.830
Officers are in pursuit:

02:03:36.910 --> 02:03:40.414
a black-and-white 1974 Dodge sedan

02:03:40.496 --> 02:03:42.419
southbound on 47.

02:03:43.499 --> 02:03:46.002
Respond to signal 10-79.

02:03:46.085 --> 02:03:49.259
Occupants of vehicle:
one Joliet Jake Blues,

02:03:49.339 --> 02:03:51.387
one Elwood Blues.

02:03:51.507 --> 02:03:53.635
Considered extremely
dangerous. Gruppenführer.

02:04:03.978 --> 02:04:05.821
Hey, Jake,

02:04:07.941 --> 02:04:09.614
I gotta pull over.

02:04:18.493 --> 02:04:20.996
Southbound on State Highway 47.

02:04:46.187 --> 02:04:48.656
Hi. Wanna hand me the mike?

02:04:49.482 --> 02:04:51.109
Thanks a lot.

02:04:51.526 --> 02:04:54.450
This is car... What number are we?

02:04:55.154 --> 02:04:56.781
55.

02:04:56.990 --> 02:05:00.244
Car 55. We're in a truck.

02:05:07.834 --> 02:05:10.678
Signal 10-79 still engaged.

02:05:10.795 --> 02:05:14.425
Vehicle travelling southbound
approaching Chicago city limits.

02:05:14.507 --> 02:05:17.019
Commander advises
will contact Chicago

02:05:17.020 --> 02:05:19.145
precincts for a local intercept.

02:05:19.220 --> 02:05:20.688
Maintain pursuit.

02:05:27.395 --> 02:05:30.706
Use of unnecessary violence
in the apprehension

02:05:30.707 --> 02:05:33.535
of the Blues Brothers
has been approved.

02:06:01.512 --> 02:06:04.857
Well, this is definitely
Lower Wacker Drive.

02:06:04.932 --> 02:06:07.685
If my estimations are correct

02:06:07.810 --> 02:06:09.483
we should be very close to

02:06:09.562 --> 02:06:12.361
the Honourable Richard
J. Daley Plaza.

02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:14.067
That's where they
got that Picasso.

02:06:14.150 --> 02:06:15.197
Yep.

02:08:48.554 --> 02:08:50.522
Son of a bitch.

02:08:57.813 --> 02:08:59.486
There they are.

02:09:39.855 --> 02:09:41.778
Oh, no. What the fuck was that?

02:09:41.857 --> 02:09:44.280
The motor. It's thrown a rod.

02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:45.361
Is that serious?

02:09:45.444 --> 02:09:46.445
Yep.

02:10:15.433 --> 02:10:16.650
Faster.

02:10:23.607 --> 02:10:24.984
Faster.

02:11:10.363 --> 02:11:11.580
Holy shit.

02:11:32.718 --> 02:11:34.345
I've always loved you.

02:11:46.565 --> 02:11:47.565
There it is.

02:12:31.944 --> 02:12:33.662
Come on.

02:13:15.279 --> 02:13:19.204
Sir, where's the office of
the Assessor of Cook County?

02:13:19.783 --> 02:13:21.501
Down the hall, turn right.

02:13:21.619 --> 02:13:23.371
Take the elevator to 1102.

02:13:23.454 --> 02:13:24.797
Thank you, sir.

02:15:44.803 --> 02:15:46.976
Excuse me. Did you see
two guys come in here

02:15:47.056 --> 02:15:49.400
with black suits and hats,
one carrying a briefcase?

02:15:49.475 --> 02:15:51.477
Yeah, I just sent them down there.

02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:52.777
Thank you.

02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:13.798
Hold the door.

02:16:42.736 --> 02:16:44.204
Let's go.

02:17:53.682 --> 02:17:55.605
Can I help you?

02:17:58.937 --> 02:18:00.359
This is where they pay
the taxes, right?

02:18:00.439 --> 02:18:01.565
Right.

02:18:01.647 --> 02:18:03.612
This money is for the
year's assessment on the

02:18:03.614 --> 02:18:05.451
Saint Helen of the
Blessed Shroud Orphanage

02:18:05.527 --> 02:18:06.653
in Calumet City, Illinois.

02:18:06.736 --> 02:18:08.614
$5,000. It's all there, pal.

02:18:16.413 --> 02:18:17.755
Stand back.

02:18:18.999 --> 02:18:20.251
Fire.

02:18:43.357 --> 02:18:45.575
