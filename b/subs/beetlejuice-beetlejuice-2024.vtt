[laughing]

14:35.657 --> 14:37.746
[student] Ghost House!

14:37.920 --> 14:38.878
When you're all
on your third kid

14:39.052 --> 14:40.880
and second divorce,

14:41.054 --> 14:42.272
we'll see who gets
the last laugh.

14:45.014 --> 14:45.928
[glass shatters]

14:50.150 --> 14:51.107
[Astrid] Perfect.

14:52.413 --> 14:55.895
[cell phone ringing]

14:56.069 --> 14:57.244
- Leave me alone.
- [cell phone clatters]

14:57.418 --> 15:00.160
[melancholy music playing]

15:09.560 --> 15:12.781
So it's settled. We'll bring
Charles home to Winter River.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.304
But I've never
hosted a funeral...

15:14.478 --> 15:15.479
- [line ringing]
- I've never hosted anything

15:15.653 --> 15:17.177
without Charles standing there.

15:17.351 --> 15:19.092
Watching me. In awe.

15:19.266 --> 15:20.920
[Astrid voicemail] <i>It's Astrid.</i>

15:21.094 --> 15:22.399
<i>- Please don't leave a message.
- [sighs] She won't pick up.</i>

15:22.573 --> 15:24.575
Maybe I should tell Astrid
about Charles.

15:25.620 --> 15:26.838
Might be easier coming from

15:27.013 --> 15:28.449
a non-feminine
masculine archetype.

15:28.623 --> 15:31.147
Well, there aren't any men
left in the family.

15:31.321 --> 15:33.584
Well, no offense taken, Delia.

15:33.758 --> 15:35.412
I'll be a member of the family
soon enough.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.241
In fact,

15:38.415 --> 15:39.764
I might be the perfect person
to tell her.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.071
Having just lost
my own grandfather.

15:42.245 --> 15:44.030
You did? When?

15:44.204 --> 15:45.901
Forty years ago.

15:46.075 --> 15:49.296
But in my child body,
that's yesterday.

15:49.470 --> 15:50.950
[Lydia] I'm gonna
tell Astrid, okay?

15:51.124 --> 15:52.342
Just give me a few minutes
before you come up.

15:52.516 --> 15:54.040
[Delia] Enough!
I'll handle this.

15:56.651 --> 15:57.608
[shouts] Astrid!

Astrid!

Astrid!

16:04.093 --> 16:06.966
Stop torturing your mother.

16:07.140 --> 16:08.968
I know I usually find it funny,

16:09.142 --> 16:10.534
and only fair
after the way she treated me

16:10.708 --> 16:11.927
- when she was your age.
- [Rory sighs]

16:12.101 --> 16:13.537
But not today!

16:14.799 --> 16:17.324
Your mummy's lost her daddy.

16:17.498 --> 16:18.716
You've lost your grandpa.

16:19.891 --> 16:21.502
And I've lost my...

[sobbing] Charles.

16:26.159 --> 16:27.638
Charles!

16:28.509 --> 16:31.120
Oh, Charles!

16:33.949 --> 16:36.691
Can't believe Grandpa is dead.

16:36.865 --> 16:38.867
He's like the only semi-normal
person in this family.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.043
[Lydia] We're gonna be in
Winter River for a few weeks.

16:41.217 --> 16:42.653
What do you mean
for a few weeks?

16:42.827 --> 16:44.090
I thought we were just
going for the funeral.

16:44.264 --> 16:45.482
Well, we need to clear out
the house.

16:45.656 --> 16:47.049
Grandpa loved that place.

16:47.223 --> 16:48.659
[Delia] Yes, and we are going
to honor him

16:48.833 --> 16:50.705
with a Grief Collective.

16:50.879 --> 16:52.663
A "Grief Collective"?

16:52.837 --> 16:57.973
I am seeing a semi-multimedia
visual manifesto of our loss.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.453
What does loss look like?

16:59.627 --> 17:02.325
Is it just tears? A headstone?

17:02.499 --> 17:03.848
Wilting gladioli?

17:04.023 --> 17:07.243
No, we need to unpack
the art of sorrow.

17:08.853 --> 17:10.986
Yeah, that sounds
really traumatic.

17:11.160 --> 17:12.118
I can't go.

17:12.292 --> 17:13.902
I'm our school rep

Conference next week.

17:15.860 --> 17:17.384
We're presenting our demands
on climate change action.

17:17.558 --> 17:19.603
I spoke with the principal,
and they cleared it.

17:19.777 --> 17:21.997
She actually thinks
it's a really good idea.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.912
Yeah, well, I guess when you
donate an entire art center,

17:24.086 --> 17:25.696
the principal becomes your
little puppet on a string.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.091

off a tree hugger's salary.

17:43.366 --> 17:46.195
Okay, can you stop being

17:46.369 --> 17:48.719
- Go back.
- Why?

All right, people already know
you'd rather spend

Hey.

Must be pretty
noisy up here. Yeah?

28:39.021 --> 28:40.109
In here, too.

28:42.285 --> 28:44.548
Listen, if you ever
need to process

28:44.723 --> 28:46.550
any of your emotions,
I'm here for you.

[burps]

28:50.119 --> 28:52.818

28:52.992 --> 28:55.516
I saw you standing
at your grandfather's grave.

28:57.170 --> 28:58.301
He must have been
a pretty dope dude.

29:01.043 --> 29:02.653
Death is so, like...

29:04.090 --> 29:07.746
[groans] It's, like, tragic,
you know?

29:07.920 --> 29:10.966
I mean, if you ever wanna,

29:12.707 --> 29:14.404
that you have going on
in there,

29:14.578 --> 29:15.710
I want you to know

29:15.884 --> 29:18.017
that I could be that...

kinda dope dad-dude for you.
You know?

- I'm good.
- You know,

It's, it's, it's...

29:37.427 --> 29:38.951
it starts...

29:39.125 --> 29:41.692
It, well, it kinda like
opens on grief. Obviously.

29:41.867 --> 29:44.478
And then acceptance.

29:44.652 --> 29:46.654
It's long. I didn't memorize it
or anything like that,

29:46.828 --> 29:48.351
but it's quite beautiful.

29:48.525 --> 29:50.179
Cut the crap, Rory.

29:50.353 --> 29:52.225
All right? I'm not falling

Because, like you,

29:59.667 --> 30:02.496
my mom is a very broken person.

30:02.670 --> 30:04.324
Okay?
She's a delusional fantasist.

30:05.542 --> 30:06.717
You just exploit her.

30:06.892 --> 30:07.849
And if she wants
to allow that to happen,

30:08.023 --> 30:08.981
that's on her.

30:19.034 --> 30:20.644

for your loss. I'm sorry.

"Micro"? Is that for people
with tiny houses?

30:43.276 --> 30:46.453
Why is your house
covered in black fabric?

30:46.627 --> 30:48.542
It's a mourning shroud.

30:48.716 --> 30:51.501
Now that Charles is dead,
so also dies this house.

30:51.675 --> 30:54.287
And I'm protecting it
in its transition.

30:54.461 --> 30:57.159
To a new life
with a new family.

30:57.333 --> 30:58.682

Buyers are already lining up.

31:00.467 --> 31:02.034
Thanks to you, Lydia,

31:02.208 --> 31:04.210
everyone wants a piece
of the original Ghost House.

31:04.384 --> 31:05.864
Ghosts aren't real.

31:06.038 --> 31:08.214
Only gullible people
believe that kind of crap.

31:08.388 --> 31:09.780
Unless you're trying to pay
the bills, right, Mom?

31:09.955 --> 31:11.695
[Jane] Okay, honey, in we go.

31:13.306 --> 31:14.873
Can I have
everyone's attention, please?

31:15.047 --> 31:15.917
What?

31:16.091 --> 31:17.484
We're gathered here today

31:17.658 --> 31:21.009
to celebrate the life
of an extraordinary man.

31:21.183 --> 31:22.228
Now, I only had the pleasure

31:22.402 --> 31:23.925
of meeting Charles a few times.

31:24.099 --> 31:26.232
Then I can tell you
he didn't want any speeches.

31:26.406 --> 31:28.887
Charles hated
public displays of emotion.

31:29.061 --> 31:32.194
Yeah, but he also...

31:32.368 --> 31:34.327
chose to live his life
to the fullest.

31:34.501 --> 31:37.504
I'm going to tear a page
out of Charles Deetz's book.

31:37.678 --> 31:39.332
Lydia,

31:39.506 --> 31:40.550
now, I know
we had always agreed

31:40.724 --> 31:41.638
to take
our relationship slowly.

31:41.812 --> 31:43.249
But I can't wait any longer.

31:43.423 --> 31:46.121
Let's get married
on your favorite holiday.

31:46.295 --> 31:48.123
Will you marry me on Halloween?

31:48.297 --> 31:49.516
- [mourner] Good Lord!
- [Lydia] Uh...

31:50.778 --> 31:52.127
That's... That's in two days!

31:52.301 --> 31:53.607
Yes, I know.

31:53.781 --> 31:54.521
I've already spoken
to Father Damien.

31:54.695 --> 31:56.088
The church is available.

31:56.262 --> 31:57.393

welcomes all who seek

31:57.567 --> 31:59.134
salvation
and everlasting glory.

31:59.308 --> 32:02.181
Just not before noon,
and between three and four.

32:02.355 --> 32:04.661
You're seriously doing this
at Charles' wake?

32:05.749 --> 32:08.535
Yes. Yes. Yes, because...

32:09.928 --> 32:11.842
because as we stand here,

32:12.017 --> 32:13.844
- surrounded by death...
- [scoffs]

32:14.019 --> 32:16.325
...let us all make
a commitment to choose life.

32:16.499 --> 32:17.761
Because I want to spend

32:17.936 --> 32:18.849
the rest of my life
with you, Lydia.

32:20.634 --> 32:21.678
And you, Delia.

32:23.376 --> 32:24.986
And you too.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.727
And you. Again.

32:27.554 --> 32:28.511
What do you say?

32:30.209 --> 32:31.384
Rory, I... Come on,

32:31.558 --> 32:33.603

right now.

Oh. [chuckles softly]

32:38.521 --> 32:39.740
All right.

32:42.786 --> 32:44.353
This is too much loss.
[sniffles]

32:44.527 --> 32:45.746
What do you mean?

32:45.920 --> 32:47.313
Well, first,
the death of Charles.

32:47.487 --> 32:48.836
And of course,
the death of my grandfather,

32:49.010 --> 32:50.403
which you know about.
And now the death of...

32:52.405 --> 32:54.494
- us.
- No! No, I...

32:54.668 --> 32:56.322
Come on, I didn't mean that.

32:56.496 --> 32:57.888

life's great big bungee jump

32:58.063 --> 32:58.977

32:59.151 --> 33:00.891

why I even became a cop.

38:15.423 --> 38:17.947
[footsteps approaching]

38:18.121 --> 38:19.732
You're not a cop.
You're an actor.

38:20.689 --> 38:21.647
Thank you, Janet.

38:22.735 --> 38:24.171
You keep me real.

38:24.345 --> 38:25.390
[Lieutenant] Should we take
this Beetlejuice

38:25.564 --> 38:26.739
into protective custody?

38:26.913 --> 38:28.088
See if you can find him.

38:28.262 --> 38:29.568
He's probably laying low.

38:29.742 --> 38:31.787
Scared out of his mind.

38:37.706 --> 38:39.665
[Beetlejuice]
A little higher, boys.

38:39.839 --> 38:41.667
We can't let Delores
get through that door.

38:44.974 --> 38:46.280
[Bob grunts]

38:47.412 --> 38:48.369
[snickers]

38:48.978 --> 38:50.328
Bob.

38:50.502 --> 38:51.503
Like lookin' in a mirror.

38:53.243 --> 38:55.158
You see, Bob,
you'd serve as my decoy.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.943
You'd walk in front of me
at all times.

38:57.117 --> 39:00.120
That way she'd suck your soul
while I make my getaway.

39:00.294 --> 39:01.382
[Bob groans]

39:01.556 --> 39:02.992
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

39:03.166 --> 39:04.342
[groans fearfully]

39:15.440 --> 39:16.832
Now's my chance.

39:17.006 --> 39:19.444
[suspenseful music builds]

39:21.924 --> 39:23.056
[panting]

39:23.230 --> 39:25.275
[distant screaming]

39:29.105 --> 39:30.455
[shouts] What?

39:30.629 --> 39:32.108
- Why?
- [camera shutter clicks]

39:32.282 --> 39:34.633
No! No! No!

39:34.807 --> 39:36.330
Delia, what's wrong?

39:36.504 --> 39:37.897
I'm trying to capture
the perfect primal scream.

39:38.071 --> 39:39.551
I'm gonna blow it up,
mount it on the wall,

39:39.725 --> 39:41.857
and I invite all of you
to do the same.

39:42.031 --> 39:43.685
- Why?
- For the Collective.

39:43.859 --> 39:45.774
We cannot sincerely celebrate

39:45.948 --> 39:48.342
all that was good
about our dearly departed.

39:48.516 --> 39:50.344
Not until we release the horror

39:50.518 --> 39:51.954
that they inflicted upon us.

39:52.128 --> 39:54.392
What awful thing
did Grandpa ever do to you?

39:54.566 --> 39:57.090
He bought this house
without telling me.

39:57.264 --> 39:59.614
[rushing footsteps approaching]

39:59.788 --> 40:02.138
Oh, my God!

40:02.312 --> 40:03.923
I was helpfully getting
some boxes in town,

40:04.097 --> 40:05.533
then I heard you screaming.
Are you all right?

40:05.707 --> 40:07.405
[stutters] It was Delia.

40:07.579 --> 40:08.928
Oh, Delia.

40:09.102 --> 40:10.320
[exclaims] I'm good.

40:11.147 --> 40:12.366
Ignore her.

40:12.540 --> 40:14.063
That was very
thoughtful of you.

40:14.237 --> 40:16.239
Astrid, can you give him
a hand with the boxes?

40:16.414 --> 40:18.111
[scoffs]

40:18.285 --> 40:19.721
I told the movers to come
a week from today. All right?

40:19.895 --> 40:20.809
I think that'll give us all
time to get over

40:20.983 --> 40:22.637
our grief and our trauma.

40:22.811 --> 40:23.943
And then, after the wedding,
I think we should go back,

40:24.117 --> 40:25.553
and we gotta
finish those shows.

40:25.727 --> 40:26.859
Maybe Mom can get
the ghosts in the attic

40:27.033 --> 40:28.556
to give us a hand.

40:28.730 --> 40:31.690
Adam and Barbara Maitland.
They're not here anymore.

40:31.864 --> 40:33.431
Why? They find
a better house to haunt?

40:33.605 --> 40:36.303
No, we found a loophole,
and they moved on.

40:37.130 --> 40:38.610
How convenient.

40:38.784 --> 40:44.180
- [somber music playing]
- [birds squawking]

41:16.256 --> 41:20.390
[mysterious music playing]

41:48.680 --> 41:49.637
Ew.

42:10.484 --> 42:15.184
[sentimental music playing]

42:26.935 --> 42:30.286
[footsteps approaching]

42:37.511 --> 42:39.078
Oh.

42:39.252 --> 42:40.949
God, I thought I lost those.

42:43.038 --> 42:46.912
That was taken at an all-night
Mario Bava horror fest.

42:47.086 --> 42:49.567
I was nine months
pregnant with you.

42:49.741 --> 42:52.091
My water broke during
<i>Kill, Baby... Kill!</i>

42:53.788 --> 42:54.920
Dad's favorite movie.

42:55.094 --> 42:56.008
Yeah.

42:56.182 --> 42:57.139
Can I keep this?

42:58.184 --> 42:59.838
Yeah.

43:00.012 --> 43:01.753
I really like that model
of Winter River, too.

43:02.754 --> 43:04.190
Did Grandpa make that?

43:04.364 --> 43:07.019
[Lydia] No, that belonged
to the Maitlands.

43:07.193 --> 43:09.630
You know,
the non-existent ghost couple.

43:15.505 --> 43:16.594
[ominous music playing]

43:18.683 --> 43:20.119
Oh, I found that on the floor.

43:20.293 --> 43:23.339
- Hey, who's Beetlejuice?
- Don't ever say that name!

43:23.513 --> 43:24.993
Not ever!

43:25.167 --> 43:27.300
- Beetlejuice.
- No! Astrid, I'm serious.

43:27.474 --> 43:29.781
If you say that name
three times, really bad stuff

43:29.955 --> 43:31.260
- is gonna happen.
- Like what?

43:31.434 --> 43:33.262
In fact,
this attic is off-limits.

43:33.436 --> 43:34.916
Do you understand me?

43:35.090 --> 43:36.265
[Astrid] Yeah, I understand
that you're crazy.

43:40.139 --> 43:42.097
[laughing maniacally]

43:47.537 --> 43:51.890
[laborious breathing]

43:52.064 --> 43:53.369
Oh, my God, it's you!

43:53.543 --> 43:55.589
I thought a moose
was about to attack me.

43:55.763 --> 43:57.896
It's breathing exercises.

43:58.070 --> 43:59.637
Try seeing ghosts every day.

44:01.116 --> 44:02.117
Astrid!

44:03.292 --> 44:04.206
- Let her be.
- [sighs]

44:04.380 --> 44:05.860
God, she hates me.

44:06.034 --> 44:07.862
[Delia chuckles]

44:08.036 --> 44:10.560
[Lydia] Somehow, Richard's
death is still my fault.

44:10.735 --> 44:12.432
You blamed me
for your mother's.

44:12.606 --> 44:14.129
She's not dead.

44:14.303 --> 44:17.176
And I didn't blame you.
I resented you.

44:17.350 --> 44:18.351
There's a difference.

44:18.525 --> 44:19.918
You weren't very nice.

44:20.092 --> 44:22.485
No, you barely acknowledged
my existence.

44:22.660 --> 44:24.313
But we've done all right,
haven't we?

44:24.487 --> 44:27.403
Yeah. Ever since I sold out
and got famous,

44:27.577 --> 44:28.753
we have gotten closer.

44:28.927 --> 44:30.537
No, I started liking you
before that.

44:32.321 --> 44:35.324
[breathing heavily]

44:35.498 --> 44:36.848
Again with
the creepy breathing!

44:37.022 --> 44:38.719
It works!

44:38.893 --> 44:40.765
I learned it at the survivors'
retreat, where I met Rory.

44:40.939 --> 44:42.288
[Delia] Of course you did.

44:42.462 --> 44:44.203
Look, I was in shock
after Richard died.

44:44.377 --> 44:46.292
And I was working on
my unresolved feelings,

44:46.466 --> 44:48.163
and Rory had just lost
his fiancee

44:48.337 --> 44:49.643
in a skiing accident,

44:49.817 --> 44:51.732
and we were
in the same sorrow circle

44:51.906 --> 44:53.429
and we connected.

44:53.603 --> 44:55.344
Yeah.

44:55.518 --> 44:57.520
He was turned on by you at
the lowest point in your life.

44:57.695 --> 44:59.392
Okay, but this isn't about him.

44:59.566 --> 45:01.263
Astrid found this in the attic.

45:01.437 --> 45:03.135
Ew. So?

45:03.744 --> 45:05.267
So?

45:05.441 --> 45:07.574
Every now and then
I feel his presence.

45:07.748 --> 45:09.010
Like he's lurking somewhere,

45:09.184 --> 45:10.577
just out of reach.

45:10.751 --> 45:11.883
But lately,

45:12.057 --> 45:13.580
I'm seeing him again.

45:13.754 --> 45:15.930
And I was really hoping
this was all in my head.

45:16.104 --> 45:17.410
But now this?

45:17.584 --> 45:19.499
Lydia, you need
to take back your life.

45:19.673 --> 45:22.502
From the hanger-onners,
from this thing.

45:22.676 --> 45:24.025
Where's the obnoxious
little goth girl

45:24.199 --> 45:26.158
who tormented me
all those years ago?

45:27.072 --> 45:28.726
It's time to find her.

45:43.131 --> 45:44.393
- [Astrid] Hey.
- Hey.

45:50.443 --> 45:52.358
- [woman] Jeremy, is that you?
- Yeah.

45:52.532 --> 45:54.534
Uh, Mom, I'm just gonna
be upstairs with a friend.

45:54.708 --> 45:55.883
[woman] Okay. Have fun.

45:57.406 --> 45:59.408
[dishes clinking]

45:59.582 --> 46:00.758
[TV playing indistinctly]

46:00.932 --> 46:02.107
- [Jeremy] Hey, Dad.
- [man] Son.

46:02.281 --> 46:04.283
Stuck on...
He lives in that room.

46:11.159 --> 46:15.163
["Where's the Man" by Scott
Weiland playing on stereo]

46:15.337 --> 46:17.600
You've got a lot of '90s vinyl.

46:17.775 --> 46:18.688
Where are you
finding this, eBay?

46:18.863 --> 46:21.691
No, I troll old record stores.

46:21.866 --> 46:23.693
I don't trust

46:29.830 --> 46:31.049

the Recently Deceased.</i>

46:31.223 --> 46:33.399
Yeah, I got that
at a yard sale in town.

46:33.573 --> 46:36.010
The illustrations
are pretty gnarly. [chuckles]

46:36.184 --> 46:37.707
[Astrid] Yeah, looks like
the kinda crappy book

46:37.882 --> 46:38.839
my mom would write.

46:40.362 --> 46:41.668
What's the deal
with your parents?

46:41.842 --> 46:44.062
Well, my mom spends
every waking hour

46:44.236 --> 46:46.804
in the kitchen stress-baking.

46:46.978 --> 46:49.197
And my dad used to work
at the paper mill,

46:49.371 --> 46:50.851
but then he had an accident,

46:51.025 --> 46:53.854
so now he's a full-time
couch potato.

46:54.028 --> 46:56.335
I can't wait to get out
of this shitty town.

46:58.293 --> 47:00.774
Um, you must have been
to a lot of places

47:00.948 --> 47:03.124
traveling, with a famous mom.

47:03.298 --> 47:05.039
[Astrid] Not really.

47:05.213 --> 47:06.867
My dad's
more the traveler anyway.

47:07.041 --> 47:07.955
We used to have this big plan

47:08.129 --> 47:09.435
where we were gonna visit

47:09.609 --> 47:11.132
the top ten
creepiest places on Earth.

47:11.306 --> 47:14.309
So, Tower of London
and Dracula's Castle and...

47:14.483 --> 47:17.486
[scoffs] yeah, then we never
got the chance to do it.

47:18.313 --> 47:19.358
What happened?

47:20.402 --> 47:22.535
A boat accident.

47:22.709 --> 47:24.232
Yeah, they searched
the Amazon for a week,

47:24.406 --> 47:25.668
and they never found his body.

47:27.627 --> 47:29.237
[sighs]

47:29.411 --> 47:30.412
You really miss him.

47:32.501 --> 47:34.025
Yeah.

47:34.199 --> 47:35.461
You know,
I at least would have liked

47:35.635 --> 47:37.115
to have gotten the chance
to say goodbye.

47:37.289 --> 47:38.551
But can't your mom,

47:38.725 --> 47:40.161
I don't know, like,

47:40.335 --> 47:42.642
contact him or...

47:42.816 --> 47:43.948
She claims
she can't even see him.

47:44.122 --> 47:45.906
- Why not?
- Because she's a fraud.

47:46.080 --> 47:48.822
Well, I think
that's a little harsh.

47:50.476 --> 47:52.652
Uh, well, tomorrow's Halloween.

47:52.826 --> 47:55.873
I know. Used to be
my favorite holiday.

47:56.047 --> 47:58.005
Because my dad,
he would go all out

47:58.179 --> 47:59.833
and make the most
age-inappropriate costumes.

48:00.007 --> 48:01.574
- [chuckles]
- Yeah, I think I was

48:01.748 --> 48:03.881
in second grade when I went
as Munch's <i>The Scream.</i>

48:04.055 --> 48:06.709
- Wow. Yeah.
- Yeah. It was a choice.

48:06.884 --> 48:08.059
But now my mom's
getting married that day,

48:08.233 --> 48:09.451
so I don't know,

48:09.625 --> 48:11.149
probably be
my least favorite now.

48:11.323 --> 48:12.367
Well, what time's the wedding?

48:12.541 --> 48:14.674
Midnight. The witching hour.

48:14.848 --> 48:16.589
Future stepdad's lame idea.

48:18.156 --> 48:20.985
Well, why don't you
come over...

48:22.116 --> 48:23.074
earlier?

48:24.336 --> 48:25.990
Uh, we could,

48:26.164 --> 48:30.037
I don't know, we could order
pizza and give out candy.

48:31.952 --> 48:34.912
Only if you want to.
I mean that's, that's no...

48:35.695 --> 48:36.957
no pressure.

48:40.961 --> 48:43.703
What is up
with these creepy birds?

48:43.877 --> 48:45.923
Bird-watching
was my dad's passion.

48:46.097 --> 48:47.925
Oh, I contacted
that vintage shop

48:48.099 --> 48:49.883
you love in SoHo.

48:50.057 --> 48:52.233
They've sent a few
potential wedding dresses.

48:52.407 --> 48:53.931
Should be here later today.

48:54.105 --> 48:55.454
Ooh, great. Thanks.

48:57.195 --> 48:58.587
And a, uh,

48:58.761 --> 49:00.894
little bird may have
chirped our big news

49:01.068 --> 49:03.070
to a few news outlets.

49:03.244 --> 49:05.420
Thought we could
sell the photos exclusively.

49:05.594 --> 49:07.205
Could be great press
for the show.

49:07.379 --> 49:09.903
I... Look, I'm really excited
about tying the knot,

49:10.077 --> 49:13.298
but can we just keep it
small and private?

49:13.472 --> 49:15.691
Yeah. Well, sure.

49:15.865 --> 49:16.866
It's your big day.

49:17.563 --> 49:18.651
Night. Whatever.

Lydia?

49:39.106 --> 49:41.891
Who are you yelling at?

49:42.066 --> 49:44.198
Do you remember that
couples therapist that we saw,

49:44.372 --> 49:45.721
- Dr. Glickman?
- Mmm.

49:45.895 --> 49:47.462
He said that I was holding
something back

49:47.636 --> 49:49.943

you and I wouldn't evolve.

- Okay, well, he was right.

49:52.641 --> 49:54.774
And I'm going to tell you now.

49:54.948 --> 49:55.949
And, fair warning,

49:56.123 --> 49:58.647
it's gonna sound batshit crazy.

49:58.821 --> 50:01.041
Are you okay with that?

50:01.215 --> 50:02.608
Of course. I'd love to.

50:02.782 --> 50:04.305
Let's break through
this barrier together.

50:04.479 --> 50:06.133
Okay, just give me a sec.

50:07.961 --> 50:08.962
[exhales]

50:10.050 --> 50:11.530
When I was a teenager,

50:11.704 --> 50:14.881
a trickster demon
terrorized my entire family

50:15.055 --> 50:16.578
and tried to force me
to marry him,

50:16.752 --> 50:19.799
in order to come back
to the real world for good.

50:19.973 --> 50:22.323
I believed he was gone forever,

50:22.497 --> 50:24.630
and then lately,
I have been seeing him again.

50:24.804 --> 50:27.328
And now, he is actually back.

50:27.502 --> 50:30.940
And I don't know why,
or how, or what to do.

50:33.682 --> 50:35.380
Okay, so you're saying that
someone called Beetlejuice...

50:35.554 --> 50:36.903
Don't say his name!

50:37.077 --> 50:38.774
If you say his name
three times,

50:38.948 --> 50:40.298
he will appear.

50:42.300 --> 50:45.564
Okay. So this...

50:45.738 --> 50:48.567
demon is clearly a construct
of your unpacked trauma.

50:48.741 --> 50:50.134
It's trauma that
you're gonna need to face,

50:50.308 --> 50:51.657
otherwise, it's just
gonna get worse.

50:51.831 --> 50:54.834
He's not a construct.
He is literally a demon.

50:56.401 --> 50:58.664
I know this
is a big step for you.

50:58.838 --> 51:00.405
But in the words

the push you need.

59:35.963 --> 59:38.139
You're dead, I'm alive.
That doesn't make any sense.

59:39.271 --> 59:40.620
Well, uh,

59:40.794 --> 59:42.491
what if I told you

59:42.666 --> 59:44.276
that I'd found a way
to come back.

59:45.930 --> 59:47.279
To be human again.

59:47.453 --> 59:49.411
Um, it's all in this book.

59:49.586 --> 59:51.283
Uh, everyone gets one of these
when they die.

59:51.457 --> 59:52.545
It's kind of complicated,

59:52.719 --> 59:54.852
but, uh, I can only do it

59:55.026 --> 59:58.682
with the help
of a living person.

59:58.856 --> 01:00:01.728
And you could literally
give me my life back.

01:00:01.902 --> 01:00:04.383
I don't know.
Maybe we could ask my mom?

01:00:04.557 --> 01:00:06.907
'Cause she's supposed to be
the undead expert, right?

01:00:07.081 --> 01:00:08.474
Yeah, well, I...

01:00:08.648 --> 01:00:10.998
I'm sure she'll give you
a million reasons

01:00:11.172 --> 01:00:12.521
to stay away.

01:00:12.696 --> 01:00:14.349
But I'll give you one reason
to help me.

01:00:16.351 --> 01:00:18.571
You'd get to see your dad.

01:00:19.398 --> 01:00:20.399
Again.

01:00:20.573 --> 01:00:26.535
[suspenseful music playing]

01:00:34.979 --> 01:00:36.676
[Jane sighs] I have the first
official open house

01:00:36.850 --> 01:00:38.243
a week from Sunday,

01:00:38.417 --> 01:00:40.027
and then we will let
the bidding war begin.

01:00:40.201 --> 01:00:41.333
Where's Rory?

01:00:41.507 --> 01:00:43.074
Supermarket.

01:00:43.248 --> 01:00:45.076
Swapping out the candy
I bought for carrot sticks.

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:47.426
Because Rory loves
to fun-suck everything.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.775
Even Halloween.

01:00:48.949 --> 01:00:51.430
Gotta run.
See you at the church.

01:00:51.604 --> 01:00:54.172
Oh. Unless you're calling off
the wedding?

01:00:54.346 --> 01:00:55.347
No, Delia.

01:00:56.304 --> 01:00:57.218
Where are you going?

01:00:57.392 --> 01:00:58.785
Cemetery.

01:00:58.959 --> 01:01:00.874
To commune
with my dear husband's spirit.

01:01:03.094 --> 01:01:04.835
I need to skedaddle, too.

01:01:05.009 --> 01:01:06.575
I'm co-chaperoning

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:09.230
Littler Jane's
Girl Scout troop.

01:01:09.404 --> 01:01:11.493
We spent weeks coming up
with a group costume theme.

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:14.583
We agreed nothing Disney.

01:01:14.758 --> 01:01:16.411
The closest
we ever got to Disney

01:01:16.585 --> 01:01:20.328
was when Astrid dressed
as Cinderella's dead mom.

01:01:20.502 --> 01:01:22.156
You'll never guess
what the girls came up with.

01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:24.593
- [Lydia] Mmm?
- Fruit salad.

01:01:24.768 --> 01:01:26.073
Isn't that genius?

01:01:26.247 --> 01:01:28.075
It's healthy
and non-triggering.

01:01:28.989 --> 01:01:29.947
I'm going as...

01:01:32.645 --> 01:01:34.516
"reverse mortgage."

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:36.518
Which is "mortgage"
spelled backwards.

01:01:37.781 --> 01:01:39.173
Where is Astrid?

01:01:39.347 --> 01:01:41.654
On a date. Her first.

01:01:41.828 --> 01:01:44.091
I think I'm more nervous
than she is.

01:01:44.265 --> 01:01:45.745
The boy lives over
on Jefferson.

01:01:45.919 --> 01:01:47.921
Don't mention that street.

01:01:48.095 --> 01:01:49.009
I have a listing that's kept me

01:01:49.183 --> 01:01:51.185
from a perfect sales record.

01:01:51.359 --> 01:01:53.100
Oh, it's my own fault.

01:01:53.274 --> 01:01:55.537
The place had been
on the market for years...

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:58.018
but I thought if I could sell
the "Murder House,"

01:01:58.192 --> 01:01:59.498
it would be
a feather in my cap.

01:01:59.672 --> 01:02:00.760
Murder House?

01:02:01.456 --> 01:02:02.457
Which house?

01:02:03.545 --> 01:02:05.286
125.

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:07.027
That's where
I dropped Astrid off.

01:02:07.201 --> 01:02:08.768
She was seeing
a boy named Jeremy.

01:02:08.942 --> 01:02:11.815
- [unsettling music playing]
- Jeremy Frazier?

01:02:11.989 --> 01:02:13.947
I didn't get his last name.

01:02:15.079 --> 01:02:16.733
Oh, no, it can't be him.

01:02:16.907 --> 01:02:19.910
But Jeremy Frazier
was bad news.

01:02:20.084 --> 01:02:23.304
Twenty-three years ago,
he murdered his parents.

01:02:23.478 --> 01:02:25.306
The cops found him
hiding in his tree house.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.394
When they tried to get him out,

01:02:26.568 --> 01:02:28.353
he fell, broke his neck,

01:02:28.527 --> 01:02:30.094
died instantly.

01:02:30.268 --> 01:02:31.225
[gasps]

01:02:35.621 --> 01:02:38.015
That's all you have to do
to get into the Afterlife?

01:02:38.189 --> 01:02:40.278
Draw a door with some chalk?

01:02:40.452 --> 01:02:41.714
Oh, and knock three times?

01:02:41.888 --> 01:02:43.020
I'm just doing
what it says in there.

01:02:43.194 --> 01:02:44.151
So lame.

01:02:45.065 --> 01:02:47.024
[rumbling]

01:02:47.198 --> 01:02:48.982
[debris clattering]

01:02:49.156 --> 01:02:50.636
[suspenseful music playing]

01:02:54.901 --> 01:02:56.816
- Or maybe it's not so lame.
- [chuckles]

01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:58.731
And what do we do?
We just walk through?

01:02:58.905 --> 01:03:00.646
I can. But since
you're still alive,

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.909
you have to read
that incantation first.

01:03:05.346 --> 01:03:08.828
[reading in Latin] <i>"De mundo
vivorum audeo in iterum..."</i>

01:03:09.002 --> 01:03:11.048

01:03:11.222 --> 01:03:13.528
[tires screeching]

01:03:13.702 --> 01:03:15.922
[tense music playing]

01:03:25.714 --> 01:03:26.715
[Lydia] Astrid!

01:03:29.544 --> 01:03:30.545
[grunts]

01:03:32.373 --> 01:03:34.245
[woman] Jeremy, is that you?

01:03:34.419 --> 01:03:36.682
[eerie music playing]

01:03:36.856 --> 01:03:40.164
[tense music resumes]

01:03:40.338 --> 01:03:43.123
<i>"Ut liber iterum
ambulet alius."</i>

01:03:44.559 --> 01:03:45.909
Okay.

01:03:46.083 --> 01:03:47.606
I think that worked.

01:03:48.346 --> 01:03:49.390
Astrid!

01:03:52.872 --> 01:03:53.830
Let's go see your dad.

01:03:57.311 --> 01:03:59.139
[gasps] Astrid! No!

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:06.581
Okay.

01:04:09.323 --> 01:04:15.286
[muzak playing]

01:04:17.549 --> 01:04:19.638
Uh, okay, you just wait here.

01:04:19.812 --> 01:04:21.901
I'm gonna go find out
where we're supposed to go.

01:04:22.075 --> 01:04:24.469
Make sure to ask
where my dad is.

01:04:24.643 --> 01:04:26.645
[Jeremy] Excuse me,
sorry, sorry for...

01:04:28.342 --> 01:04:29.387
[Astrid] Merry Christmas.

01:04:29.561 --> 01:04:30.779
[raspily] Merry Christmas.

01:04:32.346 --> 01:04:33.565
[Jeremy] Thanks.

01:04:33.739 --> 01:04:35.219
Okay, we need to go
to Immigration.

01:04:42.487 --> 01:04:45.272
[Charles] Excuse me, can I
please speak to your manager?

01:04:45.446 --> 01:04:48.362
My wife is gonna flay me
if I don't get home soon.

01:04:48.536 --> 01:04:50.582
[woman] That's sweet.
Take a number and a seat.

01:04:51.452 --> 01:04:52.453
[Charles scoffs]

01:04:55.369 --> 01:04:56.675
[sighs]

01:04:56.849 --> 01:04:58.198
Whoa, dude.

01:04:58.372 --> 01:04:59.330
[blood spurting]

01:05:00.287 --> 01:05:02.724
[haunting music playing]

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:05.205
[Delia] Oh,
Powers of the Hereafter,

01:05:05.379 --> 01:05:09.383
accept my Charles as
I have accepted his passing.

01:05:10.123 --> 01:05:11.559
No, I haven't.

01:05:11.733 --> 01:05:13.648
And I won't ever.

01:05:13.822 --> 01:05:15.781
There is no expiry date
on sorrow.

01:05:17.043 --> 01:05:19.263
Oh. Oh, that's good.

01:05:19.437 --> 01:05:23.006
Though there is no expiry date
on sorrow!

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:24.703
Kings of Commerce,

01:05:24.877 --> 01:05:26.226
Knights of Nasdaq,

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:30.535
deem him worthy to enter
the gates of your realm.

01:05:30.709 --> 01:05:33.103
You are no more, my king.

01:05:33.277 --> 01:05:35.279
But with the blessing
of the angels

01:05:35.453 --> 01:05:37.020
- of undying love...
- [snakes hissing]

01:05:37.977 --> 01:05:40.719
I, your surviving queen,

01:05:40.893 --> 01:05:42.982
proudly take up the mantle
of your...

01:05:43.156 --> 01:05:44.766

- [neck cracks]

[Rory] Okay.
There you go. Thank you.

01:05:52.078 --> 01:05:53.732
You all right, honey?
You look a little manic.

01:05:53.906 --> 01:05:55.255
Just pre-wedding jitters.

01:05:55.429 --> 01:05:57.040
I'm just gonna go up
and try on my dress,

01:05:57.214 --> 01:05:58.780
but don't come up

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:00.304
'cause it's bad luck to see me
before the ceremony.

01:06:00.478 --> 01:06:01.435
Sure.

01:06:02.393 --> 01:06:03.611
[children laughing]

01:06:03.785 --> 01:06:06.136
Oh, well, hello.
Who's clowning around?

01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:08.051
- [child 1] Trick or treat!
- [child 2] Trick or treat!

01:06:08.225 --> 01:06:09.487
Here we are.

01:06:09.661 --> 01:06:10.967
- Apples...
- [children] Thank you!

01:06:11.141 --> 01:06:12.969
...carrot sticks,
and some blonde raisins,

01:06:13.143 --> 01:06:14.535
'cause no one likes
a big, fat clown.

[tense music playing]

01:06:18.452 --> 01:06:19.976
I can't believe I'm doing this.

01:06:21.499 --> 01:06:23.544
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,
Beetlejuice.

[gasps]

01:06:57.839 --> 01:06:59.145
I need you to tell me
what this means.

01:06:59.319 --> 01:07:01.800
Oh, well, let's have a look,
shall we?

01:07:01.974 --> 01:07:04.237
Long story short,
your daughter's screwed.

01:07:04.411 --> 01:07:06.283
She decided to trade lives
with the boy.

01:07:06.457 --> 01:07:07.980
He gets to come back,

01:07:08.154 --> 01:07:09.460
while she's stuck
on the other side permanently.

01:07:09.634 --> 01:07:11.331
One-way ticket
on the Soul Train.

01:07:11.505 --> 01:07:12.680
- Soul Train?
- That's right.

01:07:12.854 --> 01:07:15.161
Last stop, the Great Beyond.

01:07:15.335 --> 01:07:16.902
No, she can't
get on that train.

01:07:17.076 --> 01:07:18.599
You've gotta get me in there
so I can get her out.

01:07:18.773 --> 01:07:20.123
Well, I can get you in,

01:07:20.297 --> 01:07:22.299
but it's gonna
take a quid pro quo.

01:07:22.473 --> 01:07:24.518
Of course there is.
What do you want?

01:07:24.692 --> 01:07:26.433
Well, I've got this ex-wife,
you know?

01:07:26.607 --> 01:07:28.653
And she's kind of a whack job,
first of all. We're through.

01:07:28.827 --> 01:07:30.481
She's kinda clingy.

01:07:30.655 --> 01:07:31.482
If I could just get away
from her permanently somehow.

01:07:31.656 --> 01:07:32.918
You want me to marry you!

01:07:33.092 --> 01:07:34.572
I thought you'd never ask.

01:07:34.746 --> 01:07:36.313
How do I know that
you're gonna keep your word?

01:07:36.487 --> 01:07:38.141
I swear
on my dead mother's soul.

01:07:38.315 --> 01:07:39.577
Yikes!

01:07:41.753 --> 01:07:43.276
Okay, fine.

01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:45.148
I'll marry you if you help me
save my daughter.

01:07:45.322 --> 01:07:46.453
I'm gonna need that in writing.

01:07:46.627 --> 01:07:48.064
- Give me that.
- Ow.

01:07:48.238 --> 01:07:49.195
And here we go.

01:07:52.285 --> 01:07:53.634
I'm gonna make you so happy.

01:07:53.808 --> 01:07:56.289

on getting in?

how do I get out of here?

01:19:18.144 --> 01:19:19.537
Because someone
made a terrible mistake.

Take a number. Take a seat.

01:19:23.671 --> 01:19:24.803

01:19:32.593 --> 01:19:36.859
Is there perhaps anyone here
who has the power to help me?

01:19:37.033 --> 01:19:38.338

used to work for you?

Charles Deetz.

01:19:45.171 --> 01:19:46.738
