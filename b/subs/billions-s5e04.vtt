35:40.889 --> 35:45.226

And that Taylor Mason

38:39.985 --> 38:42.403

39:01.047 --> 39:03.008
In the name of full disclosure,

39:01.047 --> 39:03.008
I Gerry'd the meeting.

39:03.049 --> 39:04.926
Completely.

39:04.968 --> 39:07.553
Okay.

39:07.595 --> 39:09.889
I'll get him to give you

39:07.595 --> 39:09.889

39:12.684 --> 39:17.105
you bring Wendy along with you.

into the community.

42:46.772 --> 42:48.066
How did that

42:46.772 --> 42:48.066
work out, Marc?

42:48.107 --> 42:50.443
Honestly?

42:48.107 --> 42:50.443
Not too well.

42:50.485 --> 42:53.029
[Marc] There was a lot of

42:50.485 --> 42:53.029
rosy talk about the future

42:53.071 --> 42:54.906
and promises were made.

42:54.947 --> 42:57.283
Only for our town's financing

42:54.947 --> 42:57.283
to be ripped away

42:57.325 --> 42:59.494

42:59.536 --> 43:02.372

49:55.284 --> 49:58.454
I'll have you hotter than the

49:55.284 --> 49:58.454

49:58.496 --> 50:02.082
Next week, you will announce

49:58.496 --> 50:02.082

50:02.082 --> 50:04.627

50:02.082 --> 50:04.627
ESG-friendly company

50:04.669 --> 50:06.295
in the Fortune 500.

50:06.337 --> 50:08.923
We are trying to stop you from

50:06.337 --> 50:08.923
the same fate the whalers had.

50:08.965 --> 50:11.342
Back in the mid-1800s,

50:08.965 --> 50:11.342
whaling was like Facebook.

50:11.383 --> 50:14.136
Blubber was the oil that

50:11.383 --> 50:14.136
lighted the Western world.

50:14.178 --> 50:16.180
But by the second half

50:14.178 --> 50:16.180
of that century,

50:16.221 --> 50:17.515
whale oil was replaced

50:16.221 --> 50:17.515
by kerosene.

50:17.556 --> 50:19.224
Whaling became MySpace.

50:19.266 --> 50:21.811
And then kerosene collapsed with

50:19.266 --> 50:21.811
the invention of electricity.

50:21.853 --> 50:24.104
So you can look like

50:21.853 --> 50:24.104
a loser from 1830,

50:24.146 --> 50:27.232
or you can look like a hero

50:24.146 --> 50:27.232
of the 2020s and beyond.

50:27.274 --> 50:28.776
[Wendy] To the

50:27.274 --> 50:28.776

50:28.818 --> 50:30.361
[Wendy] But even more to

50:28.818 --> 50:30.361
the industry and the Street.

50:30.402 --> 50:35.031
Because you will be

50:30.402 --> 50:35.031
making so much money.

50:35.073 --> 50:37.451
-I like how that sounds.

50:35.073 --> 50:37.451

50:37.493 --> 50:39.203

50:37.493 --> 50:39.203

50:39.244 --> 50:40.746

52:30.314 --> 52:32.984
