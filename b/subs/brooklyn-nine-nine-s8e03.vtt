00:06.297 --> 00:08.758
For most people, a burrito
is a delicious meal

00:08.842 --> 00:12.095
wrapped in a tortilla,
but for one NYPD officer,

00:12.178 --> 00:14.931
it turned out to be a mouse
wrapped in a nightmare.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.641
So I order a grande steak.

00:16.725 --> 00:18.685
I get back to my car,
take a big bite, and crunch.

00:18.768 --> 00:20.687
That's when I see it-- a dead mouse.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.605
A dead mouse that Frank O'Sullivan,

00:22.689 --> 00:24.023
the President of the Patrolman's Union,

00:24.107 --> 00:26.276
says was put there on purpose.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.611
This was an act of political violence

00:28.695 --> 00:33.033
organized by a group of radical
anti-cop Antifa anarchists

00:33.116 --> 00:34.617
<i>working out of The Burrito Haven.</i>

00:34.701 --> 00:36.494
This is bogus.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.205
The officer called in a to-go
order under the name Tom.

00:39.289 --> 00:41.374
The restaurant had no idea he was a cop

00:41.458 --> 00:43.209
when they made the food or packed the bag.

00:43.293 --> 00:46.212
So, clearly, he wasn't targeted
for "being a police officer."

00:46.296 --> 00:47.922
I've always wanted to try mouse meat.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.091
-I hear it's really tasty.
-From who?

00:50.175 --> 00:52.051
The union made it up as a power move.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.470
O'Sullivan wants me to issue

00:53.553 --> 00:55.555
a statement of public support
for the officer,

00:55.638 --> 00:57.223
to give them all extra hazard pay

00:57.307 --> 01:00.101
and to wear this
Never Forget Burrito ribbon.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.853
Weird. It's the exact same color

01:01.936 --> 01:03.605
as my Color Blind Awareness ribbon.

01:03.688 --> 01:05.982
No, it isn't. I won't give in
to any of their demands.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.525
The union is powerful, but I'm sure

01:07.609 --> 01:09.569
that most of our uniformed
officers understand

01:09.652 --> 01:11.571
this incident is nonsense.

01:11.654 --> 01:14.949
It is, as Peralta would say,
"No big 'whoop.'"

01:15.033 --> 01:16.534
I appreciate the shout-out, sir,

01:16.618 --> 01:18.161
but I actually don't pronounce
the H in whoop.

01:18.244 --> 01:21.081
Sir, all the uniformed
officers just left.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.749
They're staging a walkout.

01:22.832 --> 01:25.335
Well, it seems I was wrong.

01:25.418 --> 01:28.213
The "whoop" is big after all.

01:28.296 --> 01:29.506
It is.

01:29.589 --> 01:32.217
Again, though, there's no H in whoop.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.384
It's silent.

01:33.468 --> 01:34.844
"Whoop."

01:34.928 --> 01:36.387
-Whoop.
-"Whoop."

01:36.471 --> 01:37.806
Am I crazy? How do you say it?

01:37.889 --> 01:39.766
-I say "whoop."
-Okay.

02:00.411 --> 02:02.956
How is it possible that every
single uniformed officer

02:03.039 --> 02:04.207
got sick at once?

02:04.290 --> 02:05.625
They're not actually sick.

02:05.708 --> 02:06.918
They aren't actually allowed to strike,

02:07.001 --> 02:08.086
so they made up a medical excuse.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.087
It's called a Blue Flu.

02:09.170 --> 02:11.339
Without uniforms on the street,
crime's gonna go up.

02:11.422 --> 02:12.799
Do we have to negotiate with the union?

02:12.882 --> 02:14.884
No. I haven't gone through
decades of hell

02:14.968 --> 02:16.845
to become a captain in the NYPD

02:16.928 --> 02:19.013
just to cave to a clown like O'Sullivan.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.974
We can't let him win, and we won't.

02:21.057 --> 02:22.225
But how? What are we gonna do?

02:22.308 --> 02:24.060
I'm initiating Operation Trident.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.895
Cool. Just like the sugarless gum--

02:25.979 --> 02:27.438
because we're gonna chew them up.

02:27.522 --> 02:30.316
No, like the famed weapon of the sea,

02:30.400 --> 02:32.944
forged by the Cyclops
for Poseidon himself.

02:33.027 --> 02:35.613
The trident has three prongs,
like my approach.

02:35.697 --> 02:36.948
Ah, not to interrupt,

02:37.031 --> 02:38.783
but Aquaman's trident has five prongs.

02:38.867 --> 02:42.203
That's absurd.
The prefix tri means three.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.789
What this aquatic-man carries
is better termed a "pentadent."

02:44.873 --> 02:46.332
No, it's a trident.

02:46.416 --> 02:47.876
They call it that in the
original theatrical release

02:47.959 --> 02:49.669
and the Snyder cut.

02:49.752 --> 02:51.045
So you're 100% wrong,
and everyone's laughing at you.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.213
Well, regardless,

02:52.297 --> 02:53.798
Operation Trident has three prongs.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.592
Prong one, Boyle and Peralta.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.176
Oh, nice, the most important prong.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.219
-Mm-hmm.
-Wrong.

02:58.303 --> 02:59.554
Prong two, the center prong,

02:59.637 --> 03:01.264
is the most important prong on a trident.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.640
It's the longest and straightest

03:02.724 --> 03:05.143
and breaks the least often.

03:05.226 --> 03:06.936
Are you just mad because
I questioned you about the Aquaman thing?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.230
Yes. The officers
all had doctor's notes.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.398
Prove those notes are fraudulent,

03:10.481 --> 03:12.066
and they'll be forced back to work.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.610
-We're on it.
-Prong two--

03:13.693 --> 03:16.779
Jeffords and Santiago,
your job is to keep crime down.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.240
Figure out how we police
this precinct with no police.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.576
Prong two, baby-- the best prong.

03:21.659 --> 03:23.328
I mean, we're all in it together.

03:23.411 --> 03:24.954
It's not like this is
a competition between prongs.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.748
Says the prong who breaks the most.

03:26.831 --> 03:30.335
Prong three is proving they
faked the mouse in the burrito.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.295
If we can demonstrate
this was a media stunt,

03:32.378 --> 03:34.380
the uniforms will have to
come back to work.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.507
But this investigation
must be done unofficially

03:36.591 --> 03:39.636
with an investigator from
outside the NYPD,

03:39.719 --> 03:42.138
aka Rosa Diaz.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.806
It's a good idea,
but she's not gonna like being

03:43.932 --> 03:45.975
-one of those dinky side prongs.
-That's a good point.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.061
I'll make hers the sharpest. Dismissed.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.188
What? No! I want to be a sharp prong!

03:50.271 --> 03:51.231
That's not fair!

03:52.023 --> 03:54.108
All these notes are
from the same doctor.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.444
Everyone got a blood test,
and they all had mono?

03:56.527 --> 03:57.737
That seems really improbable.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.364
Yeah, nobody gets mono at this age.

03:59.447 --> 04:01.366
You get it as an eight-year-old,
and then you're immune.

04:01.449 --> 04:02.700
Wait, you get it as an eight-year-old?

04:02.784 --> 04:03.826
Mono? The kissing disease?

04:03.910 --> 04:05.161
No, it's the cousin's disease.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.621
You get it by kissing your cousins.

04:06.704 --> 04:08.748
-Oh, I guess we're both right.
-No.

04:08.831 --> 04:11.167
Wait a minute-- if you're immune,

04:11.251 --> 04:13.211
then you can tell the doctor
you're from the Nine-Nine,

04:13.294 --> 04:14.879
and when he gives you a mono diagnosis…

04:14.963 --> 04:16.631
We'll have proof
that his notes are fake.

04:16.714 --> 04:17.966

-Wow.

-So, if Terry goes home, he's not tough?
-Here we go.

04:45.159 --> 04:46.869
Lieutenant, we don't have
the time today to make this

04:46.953 --> 04:48.329
about some larger insecurity

04:48.413 --> 04:49.998
you have regarding your toughness.

04:50.081 --> 04:52.458
First of all, I'm not
insecure about my toughness.

04:52.542 --> 04:56.212
Secondly, being sick has
nothing to do with being tough.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.382
Thirdly, if I wasn't tough,
would I be daring Amy

04:59.465 --> 05:01.509
-to punch me in the stomach?
-Wha--

05:01.592 --> 05:03.303
Come on, Amy! Give me your best shot!

05:03.386 --> 05:05.263
Fine. Just so that we can move on.

05:05.346 --> 05:09.267

05:09.350 --> 05:11.561
See? I'm fine.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.229
Now, if you'll excuse me,

05:13.313 --> 05:15.690
I'm gonna go for a walk in the fresh air

05:15.773 --> 05:18.693
with my best friend, the trash can.

05:18.776 --> 05:20.236
I'll be back 'cause I'm tough!

05:20.320 --> 05:22.030
Let's talk quickly before he returns

05:22.113 --> 05:23.781
and makes this all about himself again.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.658
Okay. We can't use uniforms
from other precincts

05:25.742 --> 05:27.118
because they'll call out sick, too.

05:27.201 --> 05:29.287
So I asked the other captains
in the district

05:29.370 --> 05:30.705
to lend us some detectives.

05:30.788 --> 05:31.998
Smart. They have a different union.

05:32.081 --> 05:33.666
And they each sent us two people.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.043
They said they were happy to do it.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.961
Huh. That's odd.

05:37.045 --> 05:40.548
I wouldn't be happy to give up
two of my detectives, unless--

05:40.631 --> 05:41.924
Dear God.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.010
They sent us their Hitchcock-and-Scullys.

Mm-hmm. So now that you know
where I'm from,

05:55.897 --> 05:57.565
can you just write me a note?

05:57.648 --> 05:59.317
Uh, no, actually, I need to
order bloodwork

05:59.400 --> 06:01.110
-and do a full exam.
-Ah.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.737
-Lift up.
-Oh, yeah.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.614
Oh. Now, that is interesting.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.783
Oh, did you find a sign of mono?

06:06.866 --> 06:08.534
-No, it's your testicle.
-My what?

06:08.618 --> 06:10.328

06:12.622 --> 06:14.957
Well, yes,
but it shouldn't be that large.

06:15.041 --> 06:18.002
And also of concern
is the shape and the color…

06:18.086 --> 06:19.295
Yeah, that doesn't sound good.

06:19.378 --> 06:20.505
<i>And the texture.</i>

-So…

-I did.

Even the part where
he's talking about my huge--

06:30.973 --> 06:33.726
Yep. Yep, yep, yep. All the parts.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.228
-You okay?
-Yeah.

06:35.311 --> 06:37.605
I mean, could be cancer.
Might have spread.

06:37.688 --> 06:39.023
But I'm fine. I can handle this.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.858
You sure about that?

You weren't there when
I explained Operation Trident.

06:54.789 --> 06:55.915
So, uh, what did you find?

06:55.998 --> 06:57.375
Nothing yet, and if you want me

06:57.458 --> 06:58.960
to keep digging,
we need to talk about my fee.

06:59.043 --> 07:00.878
I need cash. Most of
my other work is pro bono.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.839
This is unofficial. I can't pay.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.841
Right, but there is something
you can give me,

07:04.924 --> 07:06.843
something just as valuable as money.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.512
-I want to see your tattoo.
-That's just as valuable?

07:09.595 --> 07:11.889
It is to Jake. He's offered
a significant reward.

07:11.973 --> 07:14.183
Wow. It is so ridiculous how much weight

07:14.267 --> 07:16.060
you've all given to my silly tattoo,

07:16.144 --> 07:18.271

that I'll take to my grave.

07:18.354 --> 07:19.522
I notice you haven't said yes yet.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.107
'Cause no one can ever know.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.775
Okay, fine.

07:22.859 --> 07:26.070
If you can prove how that mouse
got into that burrito,

07:26.154 --> 07:27.613
I'll tell you what my tattoo is.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.740

-You're a monster.

07:33.369 --> 07:35.037
Well, the good news

07:35.121 --> 07:36.873
is the Scully-and-Hitchcocks
actually work well together.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.458
That is good news.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.877
The bad news is it's at
making a back-scratch circle.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.670
I always wondered
what it would be like to have

07:42.753 --> 07:44.213
a tight-knit work family.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.133
-Nine-Nine!
-[all] Nine-Nine!

07:47.216 --> 07:49.969
Ah, there they are-- prong one,

07:50.052 --> 07:51.846
my most important prong.

07:51.929 --> 07:53.848
Oh, thank you. Nice of you
to finally recognize

07:53.931 --> 07:55.349
what our prong brings to this.

he'll be an orphan… again.

08:05.234 --> 08:07.361
So, yeah. Prong one
pretty much broke immediately.

08:07.445 --> 08:08.905
I'm gonna call HR. Get ahead of that butt.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.409
Here's where we stand.
The Blue Flu continues.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.994
O'Sullivan and the union won't budge

08:15.077 --> 08:17.205
on their mouse-burrito demands.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.624
Also, arrests are down.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.792
Santiago, Jeffords, what
on earth happened yesterday?

08:21.876 --> 08:24.086
The new detectives
won't do anything I ask.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.756
-And I've had to work solo.
-Sorry.

08:26.839 --> 08:29.675
I was feeling a little sick,
but I am much better now.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.219
You look like garbage.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.095
Now, I know you're trying
to tough this out,

08:33.179 --> 08:35.139
but I've always believed
that true toughness

08:35.223 --> 08:37.391
means acknowledging your own limitations.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.727
It's okay, Terry. Go home.

08:39.810 --> 08:41.771
Thank you, sir. I'll be back in a jiffy.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.397
[stomach gurgles]

08:43.481 --> 08:45.149
I can't believe he bought that drivel.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.443
True toughness means working through pain.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.736
Everyone knows that.

08:48.819 --> 08:50.655
Peralta, where are we with the doctor?

08:50.738 --> 08:52.615
We're gonna tail him and see
if he contacts O'Sullivan.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.575
Smart. And, uh, what is going
on with Detective Boyle?

08:54.659 --> 08:55.993
Is he okay?

08:56.077 --> 08:58.037
Oh, you mean why is he
face-deep in cheese?

08:58.120 --> 09:00.414
Yeah, it's made from the milk
of a Balkan donkey

09:00.498 --> 09:01.958
and apparently it's quite expensive.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.001
Spent 12 thou on ass cheese.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.545
Also, he's pretending like

09:05.628 --> 09:07.129
he doesn't know
what ass cheese sounds like.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.673
Are you sure he should be working?

09:08.756 --> 09:10.299
His doctor said
there's nothing to worry about

09:10.383 --> 09:11.551
until we get the actual test results back.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.635
And Charles said that work

09:12.718 --> 09:14.929
is the only thing keeping him
from thinking about death.

09:15.012 --> 09:17.181
Coat's to keep me warm…

09:17.265 --> 09:18.724
in my grave.

09:21.018 --> 09:22.645
I mean, he's not doing great.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.356
Oh, you guys still have lunch together?

09:25.439 --> 09:26.732
<i>Twice a day, every day.</i>

09:26.816 --> 09:28.234
Look, I need help figuring out

09:28.317 --> 09:29.986
how to inspire these new guys.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.487
What motivates you?

09:31.571 --> 09:33.155
Well, I'd do anything to retire

09:33.239 --> 09:35.575
and spend the rest of my days
with Hitchcock in Brazil.

09:35.658 --> 09:36.867
Huh. That's actually pretty helpful.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.452
<i>That's the dream--</i>

09:38.536 --> 09:40.121
<i>Scully and me on the sex barge</i>
<i>I'm building.</i>

09:40.204 --> 09:41.664
Okay. Scully was already helpful.

09:41.747 --> 09:42.748
You don't have to keep talking.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.458
These are pedometers,

09:44.542 --> 09:46.502
which will prove that you're
actually walking your beat.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.920
[detectives groan]

09:48.004 --> 09:49.964
But whoever gets the most steps in

09:50.047 --> 09:53.092
will receive seven days of overtime.

09:53.175 --> 09:57.430
Therefore, you'll be one week
closer to retirement.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.724
And one week closer
to a couple's massage

09:59.807 --> 10:01.976
with your best friend on his sex barge.

10:02.059 --> 10:04.854
[detectives cheering]

10:05.646 --> 10:07.398
Sir, guess what.

10:07.481 --> 10:09.233
Lieutenant, I thought you went home.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.319
I did, but some uniforms
heard that I called out sick,

10:11.402 --> 10:13.321
and they assumed
I was joining the Blue Flu.

10:13.404 --> 10:15.740
They invited me to a meeting
tomorrow to talk strategy.

10:15.823 --> 10:17.408
You could go record them

10:17.491 --> 10:19.327
admitting that
they don't actually have mono.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.495
-That is, if you're up to it.
-Hell, yeah.

10:21.579 --> 10:22.872
Terry's gonna tough it out.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.625
Terry's also gonna drink
some raspberry leaf tea

10:25.708 --> 10:27.960
that Sharon uses to help her
with menstrual cramps.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.337
Oh, looks like we're adding a prong.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.840
Operation Trident is now Operation Fork.

10:32.923 --> 10:34.842
Isn't there a cooler word than "fork"?

10:34.925 --> 10:36.385
I mean, something more like "trident."

10:36.469 --> 10:38.471
Oh, no, did everyone assume
I was trying to be cool?

10:38.554 --> 10:40.222
Is that why things are going so poorly?

10:40.306 --> 10:42.266
Damn it, I've got to call Peralta.

10:42.350 --> 10:45.311
No, Operation Fork
is definitely not cool.

10:45.394 --> 10:47.188
Uh, yeah, things are going good here.

10:47.271 --> 10:48.522
We're just staking out the doctor

10:48.606 --> 10:50.316
and trying to keep a low profile.

10:50.399 --> 10:54.111
<i>♪ And I'll be your brightest-- ♪</i>

10:54.195 --> 10:56.155

<i>♪ I'll be-- ♪</i>

10:57.907 --> 10:59.742
You know what, sir?
We have another noisy neighbor.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.535
I'm just gonna call you back. Bye.

11:01.619 --> 11:04.330
All right, Charles, I get it.
You're scared.

11:04.413 --> 11:07.416
But sometimes it helps
to say our fears out loud.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.751
You know, if you put words to them,

11:08.834 --> 11:10.002
it can take away some of their powers.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.754
So come on.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.672
Stop bottling up those fears
and get them out in the open.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.677
Okay, well…

11:18.761 --> 11:21.347
[sighs] I'm scared
that whatever's in my testicle

11:21.430 --> 11:23.557
has spread and that I'm gonna die.

11:23.641 --> 11:27.019
And then I'll never get
to see Nikolaj grow up.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.356
And I won't know
what kind of man he becomes.

11:30.439 --> 11:33.317
Also, my time with you will be cut short.

11:33.401 --> 11:36.404
No more stakeouts
or drinks after a long shift

11:36.487 --> 11:39.865
or midnight calls when you've
had a breakthrough in a case.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.118
I've always had this image
of us in our 90s

11:42.201 --> 11:45.413
hunting down criminals
at the retirement home.

11:45.496 --> 11:49.041
But I guess that was just a dumb fantasy…

11:49.125 --> 11:51.794
because soon I won't be here anymore…

11:51.877 --> 11:53.421
because I'll be dead and gone

11:53.504 --> 11:55.131
and you won't ever see me again.

11:55.214 --> 11:57.425

-[crying] No.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.804
Yes.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.600
Diaz, why the hush-hush meeting?

12:06.684 --> 12:08.102
Because in one minute,

12:08.185 --> 12:09.728
you're gonna be showing me
your tramp stamp.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.188
-I don't have a tramp stamp.
-Prove it.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.774
Show me your lower back.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.026
Hmm. Seems I didn't know
what a tramp stamp was.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.736
But I'm not gonna show you anything

12:23.784 --> 12:25.578
He set the whole thing up.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.913
Diaz, you did it.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.915
And now…

12:29.999 --> 12:31.667
my payment.

12:31.750 --> 12:34.044
Okay, O'Sullivan, there's McCaffery

coming out of Perdue Pet Supplies

12:35.796 --> 12:37.798
with the mouse that he put in the burrito.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.675
So there's no need for tactical gear

12:39.758 --> 12:42.595
or a Never Forget Burrito
ribbon or any of that.

12:42.678 --> 12:44.346
You need to call off the Blue Flu.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.056
Are you crazy? My guys are under attack.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.600
No, I just proved
that it wasn't an attack.

12:47.683 --> 12:48.851
He faked it.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.394
Not that attack, this attack--

12:50.478 --> 12:52.104
the one where you call a policeman a liar.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.481
He is a liar.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.024
Oh, dear, my God. You just did it again.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.734
Do you understand
the worst thing you could do

12:56.817 --> 13:00.029
to another person
is to call that person a liar?

13:00.112 --> 13:02.156
You hate cops. That's a fact.

13:02.239 --> 13:03.824
I-I-I just thought

13:03.908 --> 13:06.327
the Blue Flu
was about a mouse in a burrito.

13:06.410 --> 13:09.330
Well, it was, but now it's
about you saying it wasn't.

13:09.413 --> 13:11.040
-That doesn't make any sense.
-So you're calling me stupid?

13:11.123 --> 13:12.750
-That's not what I said!
-You're calling me a liar?

13:12.833 --> 13:14.168
I just don't know how to talk
to someone like you.

13:14.251 --> 13:15.669
Someone like me?

13:15.753 --> 13:18.380
Wow. That's racist.

13:18.464 --> 13:22.051
Oh, this is a very
frustrating conversation.

13:28.224 --> 13:29.600
More broken than ever.

13:29.683 --> 13:31.393
Ah, well, I never had
any faith in you anyway.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.187
Santiago, how's prong two doing?

13:33.270 --> 13:34.230
We're killing it.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.439
According to the pedometers

13:35.523 --> 13:36.607
I put on the Hitchcock-and-Scullys,

13:36.690 --> 13:37.942

to end the Blue Flu.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.004
-Wait, really?
-Why so surprised?

13:59.088 --> 14:00.673
That was the plan.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.383
Yes, but earlier,
I was talking to the squad,

14:02.466 --> 14:04.301
and I put a lot of pressure
on this moment,

14:04.385 --> 14:05.803
which I then regretted.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.763
I feared I might be hoist
on my own petard.

14:07.846 --> 14:09.557
No petard hoisting here.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.100
They talked about everything
in front of me--

14:11.183 --> 14:12.643
how they planned the whole thing,

14:12.726 --> 14:14.270
how long they were gonna
pretend to be sick.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.272
And you recorded it all,
despite your own illness.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.107
I must say, I'm impressed.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.567

up my stomach noises,

14:31.453 --> 14:33.163

how I'm spending my final days.

Maybe it doesn't have to be.
Screw this case.

What's something
you've always wanted to do?

15:56.956 --> 15:59.083
Yeah, we're best friends.
Of course I know you.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.543
Well, as perfect as all your ideas were,

16:01.627 --> 16:03.837
nothing tops sitting here
with my best friend.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.965
I mean, why would I want to go
to town on Diane Wiest

16:06.048 --> 16:09.009
when I can go to town with you?

16:09.093 --> 16:10.427
What?

16:10.511 --> 16:12.054
Hang out. Go to town with each other.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.472
It's a common friendship phrase.

16:13.555 --> 16:14.640
-Haven't heard it.
-[cell phone rings]

16:14.723 --> 16:15.891
Oh.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.185
Oh, God. It's my biopsy results.

16:18.268 --> 16:19.478
-What does it say?
-I don't know.

16:19.561 --> 16:20.813
I'm too nervous. I can't read it.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.316
-It's not cancer.
-Not cancer.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.318
It's an infection,
and it's highly treatable.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.028
-I'm not gonna die?
-You're not gonna die!

16:28.112 --> 16:29.697
Oh, we got to celebrate.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.824
Does it say if it's safe to
ride a two-person banana boat?

16:31.907 --> 16:33.826
I don't know. Let me check.
It doesn't say.

16:33.909 --> 16:34.994
Oh, well…

16:35.077 --> 16:36.912
And also, I think just figured out

16:36.996 --> 16:38.872
how all those officers
got their fake diagnoses.

16:39.707 --> 16:40.916
Tell us what's written there.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.167
Patient's left teste

16:42.251 --> 16:44.003
is gnarled and shows discoloration.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.462
No, not that. There, at the top.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.256
ShareChem Medical Laboratory. Yeah, so?

16:47.339 --> 16:48.799
So we thought it was
the doctor handing out

16:48.882 --> 16:50.426
fake diagnoses, but he's clean.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.344
However, the officers knew you
used ShareChem Lab,

16:52.428 --> 16:54.471
and that lab is owned by David Share,

16:54.555 --> 16:57.391
brother of Nine-Nine officer
Michael Share.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.518
The lab faked the blood results.

16:59.601 --> 17:01.687
None of the officers are actually sick,

17:01.770 --> 17:03.480
which means they have no excuse
to miss work.

17:03.564 --> 17:04.815
Well, unfortunately, that is--

17:04.898 --> 17:06.567
Stop. I know you're gonna twist my words

17:06.650 --> 17:08.986
into some vicious attack
on you and the NYPD.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.654
So, before you do that,

17:10.738 --> 17:12.656
I'd like the pleasure of making
the vicious attack myself.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.283
Sir, your insults are kind of known

17:14.366 --> 17:16.035
to be little too think-y,
maybe you should just let--

17:16.118 --> 17:19.121
O'Sullivan, you are a [bleep],

17:19.204 --> 17:23.417
and I hope your [bleep] get
shoved right into your [bleep].

17:23.500 --> 17:25.627
Wow. Well, that was
definitely not too think-y.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.588
Okay, okay, okay. You got me.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.423
The men didn't have mono.
They weren't sick.

17:29.506 --> 17:30.674
-Damn right.
-But they are now.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.301
What?

17:32.384 --> 17:34.094
It seems they had a meeting,
and somebody showed up

17:34.178 --> 17:36.305
with a very bad stomach bug
and gave it to everyone there.

17:36.388 --> 17:40.142
I believe the officer's name
was a, uh, Lieutenant Jeffords.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.935
The petard.

17:42.019 --> 17:45.314
It just won't stop hoisting.

17:47.608 --> 17:50.069
Hey there, sir. You missed
the morning briefing.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.862
And I see you found Charles' cheese.

17:51.945 --> 17:54.281
Mmm, it pairs well with despair

17:54.364 --> 17:58.118
and also this 1976 Chateau Haut-Brion.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.621
Doesn't seem like the kind of
bottle you're supposed to chug.

18:00.704 --> 18:02.331
I bought it the day I joined the force

18:02.414 --> 18:04.374
with the intent to open it
when I became commissioner.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.876
Oh, my gosh, this is big news.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.336
Congratulations, sir.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.713
No, he's not becoming
commissioner, Scully.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.715
We can still fight the Blue Flu.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.009
It's over, Lieutenant.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.303
I have to cave to O'Sullivan's demands.

18:16.386 --> 18:17.846
Sir, you can't give up

18:17.930 --> 18:19.223
on all your hard work
because of one setback.

18:19.306 --> 18:20.891
I'm a realist.

18:20.974 --> 18:23.435
I knew I wouldn't be able
to fix every problem,

18:23.519 --> 18:26.897
though I always imagined
I could fix some of them.

18:26.980 --> 18:30.734
But as a realist, I can now see
I haven't fixed a damn thing.

18:30.818 --> 18:33.445
The NYPD will never change.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.781
Sir, if I may--
when I thought I was dying,

18:35.864 --> 18:38.200
all I could think about
was what a disappointment

18:38.283 --> 18:39.743
my life had been.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.495
But then Jake went to town with me.

18:41.578 --> 18:43.038
Common friendship phrase.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.165
And it helped me realize you can't focus

18:45.249 --> 18:46.792
on the things you didn't do.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.752
Focus on what you did do.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.880
And, more importantly,
focus on who you did it with.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.508
Boyle, you're absolutely right.

18:54.591 --> 18:56.385
I am? My speech turned your life around?

18:56.468 --> 18:58.345
No, I found it trite and uninspiring,

18:58.428 --> 18:59.930
but something you said resonated.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.599
Focus on the things you didn't do.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.393
I said not to focus
on the things you didn't do.

19:04.476 --> 19:05.769
Again, your speech meant nothing.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.771
I'm just picking out individual words.

19:07.855 --> 19:10.566
-Sure, sure, yeah.
-[snaps fingers] Hot damn.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.568
I know how to end the Blue Flu.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.945
I found a fifth prong.

19:15.028 --> 19:17.364
So I gather you're ready
to cave to my demands.

19:17.447 --> 19:18.657
-Why would I do that?
-Give me a break.

19:18.740 --> 19:19.950
Your arrests are way down,

19:20.033 --> 19:21.285
and your CompStat numbers are terrible.

19:21.368 --> 19:22.619
I think those numbers look great.

19:22.703 --> 19:25.080
-No, you don't.
-Well, not those numbers.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.665
Obviously, they make it look
like we haven't done much

19:26.748 --> 19:27.875
at all this week.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.835
But a friend of mine told me something

19:29.918 --> 19:32.254
unintentionally interesting--
focus on what you didn't do.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.756
So here's what we didn't do this week.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.217
With fewer officers at our disposal

19:37.301 --> 19:39.720
and none of them trying
to hit CompStat numbers,

19:39.803 --> 19:41.805
we made fewer bad arrests.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.892
Number of complaints
against officers, down 32%.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.977
Number of cases thrown out at arraignment

19:47.060 --> 19:49.188
for insufficient evidence, down 34%.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.648
And here's the most
important thing we didn't do.

19:51.732 --> 19:53.984
We didn't make the community less safe.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.819
Rates of major and violent crime,

19:55.903 --> 19:57.404
what actually matters, stayed the same.

19:57.487 --> 19:59.114
What are you saying?

19:59.198 --> 20:01.325
I'm saying the Nine-Nine
just became a case study

20:01.408 --> 20:02.701
for how a police force

20:02.784 --> 20:04.703
can work better with fewer police.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.705
Are you actually talking
about laying off cops?

20:06.788 --> 20:08.290
If these numbers persist,
I may have no choice.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.708
Then I'll just end the Blue Flu.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.084
Great. That's what I want.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.586
Then I won't end the Blue Flu.

20:12.669 --> 20:14.171
Great. Fewer cops. That's what I want.

20:14.254 --> 20:16.089
You just said that--

20:17.925 --> 20:20.844
This is a very frustrating conversation.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.262
[Holt] <i>I'd like to officially announce</i>

20:22.346 --> 20:24.056
that the Blue Flu is over.

20:24.139 --> 20:26.058
The uniformed officers are at work,

20:26.141 --> 20:27.768
and we sent the Hitchcock-and-Scullys

20:27.851 --> 20:29.186
back to their home precincts.

20:29.269 --> 20:30.270
So everything's back to normal?

20:30.354 --> 20:31.647
No, the opposite.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.482
We're gonna use what we learned this week

20:33.565 --> 20:35.275
to change the way
the NYPD polices our streets.

20:35.359 --> 20:36.944
Okay, awesome. Very inspiring.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.445
Now, on to more important things.

20:38.528 --> 20:42.366
I have obtained from Rosa a photograph…

20:42.449 --> 20:44.159
of Captain Holt's tattoo.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.702
-[all] Oh.
-[stammers]

20:45.786 --> 20:47.579
I'm sorry, Captain, but there's
nothing you can do

20:47.663 --> 20:49.081
that will stop me from revealing

20:49.164 --> 20:53.794
that your secret
and embarrassing tattoo is…

20:53.877 --> 20:55.671
-a dot?
-Huh?

20:55.754 --> 20:58.006
It's a decimal point.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.592
Ah, what a first-thought
mathematical symbol.

21:00.676 --> 21:03.804
Might as well have gotten a
greater-than or equal-to sign.

21:03.887 --> 21:05.973
I can't believe I spent $2,000 on a dot.

21:06.056 --> 21:07.891
-You did?
-I know, Amy!

21:07.975 --> 21:09.893
We're both upset about the same thing!

21:09.977 --> 21:11.395
[chuckles] I got to call Rosa.

21:11.478 --> 21:14.314
[distant siren wailing]

21:14.398 --> 21:16.400
[dramatic music plays]

21:16.483 --> 21:18.193
Thank you for giving Peralta
the doctored photo.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.112
My allegiances are
to the highest bidder.

21:20.195 --> 21:21.488
And you'll never tell anyone
what you saw?

21:21.571 --> 21:22.990
They wouldn't believe me if I did.

21:23.073 --> 21:24.866
I mean, come on, sir. It's a picture of--

21:24.950 --> 21:26.493
<i>-Not a doctor.</i>
<i>-Shh.</i>
