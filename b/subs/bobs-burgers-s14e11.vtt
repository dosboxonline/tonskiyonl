[Gene]
Ugh. I can't believe I'm doing

00:21.755 --> 00:23.123
math homework on a Saturday.

00:23.156 --> 00:25.225
I should be enjoying
my precious childhood right now.

00:25.292 --> 00:27.294
Yeah, you should be toiling away
in your family's restaurant,

00:27.361 --> 00:29.563
-like us.
-Yeah Gene, hurry up
and finish your homework,

00:29.629 --> 00:31.798
-so you can get in on this.
-[grunts] Dang it.

00:31.865 --> 00:32.999
-I think I need help.
-[Bob] Oh.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.768
-From someone here?
-Four!

00:34.835 --> 00:36.136
Or maybe you just
need encouragement?

00:36.203 --> 00:38.272
-You can do it, Gene.
-What's the question?

00:38.339 --> 00:41.608
It's a percentage thing, but
there's a lot of retail talk.

00:41.675 --> 00:44.779
It says, "A hat salesman
named Peter sells two hats

00:44.879 --> 00:47.180
every 20 minutes for $29 each."

00:47.281 --> 00:50.584
Uh, wait, I need to write this
down. Um, two hats, 20 minutes.

00:50.684 --> 00:53.721
"And the store is open
from 10:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m.,

00:53.787 --> 00:55.222
"but on Wednesdays, he sells

00:55.322 --> 00:57.090
-eight times
the amount of hats."
-Wednesday...

00:57.124 --> 00:58.926
-"What percentage
of weekly hat sales"
-Um, eight times the amount

00:59.026 --> 01:00.461
-"does Peter make on a Tuesday?"
-of hats...

01:00.561 --> 01:02.529
Oh... God.
What do you have so far?

01:02.629 --> 01:04.598
I just wrote down
"Peter divided by hats."

01:04.698 --> 01:07.434
I don't think the answer
is Peter divided by hats.

01:07.535 --> 01:09.770
-Hats divided by Peter?
-Um, hang on.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.172
Let's see if we can
figure this out.

01:11.272 --> 01:13.673
Um, I-I was...
really bad at math in school.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.642
-But you're good at it now?
-[phone ringing]

01:15.709 --> 01:16.911
Oh, Teddy's calling.

01:17.011 --> 01:18.879
I will of course, uh,
be able to help you

01:18.946 --> 01:20.447
after I talk to Teddy, but maybe

01:20.547 --> 01:22.883
your mom or Tina
can get you started.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.118
Uh, bye.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.986
Okay, what kind of hats
are we talking about?

01:26.052 --> 01:29.022
-Hey, Teddy.
-[Teddy] Bob, calm down.
Everything is fine.

01:29.156 --> 01:30.891
-What?
-Ah, I'm gonna be okay, Bob.

01:30.957 --> 01:32.326
We're-we're gonna
get through this.

01:32.393 --> 01:33.827
Teddy, Teddy, what's going on?

01:33.894 --> 01:35.896
I'm-I'm kind of stuck,
in a place.

01:36.030 --> 01:37.764
-You're stuck? Where?
-Underground.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.933
What?
Do you need me to call 911?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.135
No. I-I just need you to maybe

01:42.169 --> 01:43.403
come and get me out of here

01:43.470 --> 01:45.072
so I can finish the job
I'm working on.

01:45.139 --> 01:46.640
Me get you out?
G-Get you out of where?

01:46.707 --> 01:49.543
I'm stuck inside a safe
in a survival bunker.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.779
Uh, Teddy, everything
you're saying sounds crazy

01:51.812 --> 01:54.849
and like I should probably
definitely call for help.

01:54.915 --> 01:57.017
No! Don't do that.
If this job goes well,

01:57.084 --> 01:59.453
I could become this guy's
go-to handyperson.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.255
But right now,
it's-it's not going that well.

02:01.321 --> 02:03.690
-Because you're stuck in a safe?
-Because I'm stuck in a safe.

02:03.757 --> 02:06.694
I'm so sorry to ask,
I-I'm sure you're medium-busy

02:06.760 --> 02:08.529
with whatever you do, but

02:08.596 --> 02:10.498
-if you could just come
and let me out, that would be,
-Wait a minute,

02:10.564 --> 02:12.132
-what-what do you
mean whatever I do?
-Well,

02:12.199 --> 02:13.367
I know sometimes
you stand around the kitchen

02:13.434 --> 02:15.302
and you're not doing anything,

02:15.369 --> 02:17.137
-you're just kind of
staring off--
-Well, that's not the--

02:17.204 --> 02:18.805
Well, look, let's focus
on what's going on with y--

02:18.906 --> 02:20.407
I'm not saying
you're doing that now,

02:20.474 --> 02:21.742
-I'm just saying, sometimes...
-Okay, Teddy, where are you?

02:21.875 --> 02:23.110
That's the thing. I-I

02:23.143 --> 02:24.344
-don't really know.
-What do you mean?

02:24.411 --> 02:26.012
Well, I drove out
to a parking lot

02:26.079 --> 02:27.815
next to a gas station
on Main Street in Oakville,

02:27.915 --> 02:29.116
then I got into his truck

02:29.182 --> 02:30.984
and then he blindfolded me
on the way here.

02:31.018 --> 02:32.720
-He blindfolded you?
-Yeah.

02:32.786 --> 02:33.854
Teddy, who is this guy?

02:33.921 --> 02:35.189
Gerald.
He hired me to build

02:35.289 --> 02:37.591
a false wall in the back
of his safe in his bunker,

02:37.658 --> 02:39.626
so when you open the safe,
it looks empty.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.729
And then you open
a secret door in the back,

02:41.795 --> 02:42.997
and that's where he can hide

02:43.063 --> 02:44.698
his vintage
candy dispenser collection.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.201
He doesn't trust his mom,
but they love each other.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.668
-Long story.
-Okay.

02:48.769 --> 02:51.171
Last week, he hired me
to do a job at his other house,

02:51.271 --> 02:54.475
his place in town, but it
turns out it was a loyalty test.

02:54.542 --> 02:55.309
A loyalty test?

02:55.376 --> 02:56.644
He said he wanted new hardware

02:56.744 --> 02:58.078
on his drawers in his kitchen.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.080
So, I go to his place,
walks me into his kitchen,

03:00.180 --> 03:01.782
and then he says
he has to head out for a bit.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.951
I open up the first drawer
to start working on it,

03:04.051 --> 03:05.786
and there's a sandwich
sitting in there.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.421
There was a sandwich
in the drawer?

03:07.521 --> 03:09.689
Yeah. I really want to eat it,
but I don't.

03:09.756 --> 03:11.225
-Hm. Mm-hmm.
-Then I open the second drawer

03:11.292 --> 03:13.160
and there's
a piece of cake in there,

03:13.227 --> 03:14.795
-but I don't eat that either.
-Yup.

03:14.895 --> 03:15.929
[Teddy]
I open the last drawer,

03:15.996 --> 03:17.598
and it's stuffed with cash.

03:17.664 --> 03:19.433
-Um, I--
-Anyway,

03:19.499 --> 03:21.168
I didn't take any of the money.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.437
And I guess he did this to,
like, two guys before me,

03:23.537 --> 03:25.272
and they ate the sandwich,
like, right away,

03:25.339 --> 03:27.742
and then finished off the cake
and they took some of the cash.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.076
So they failed the test.

03:29.176 --> 03:30.744
I-I don't understand
just eating a sandwich

03:30.844 --> 03:32.179
you find in a drawer.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.680
It's a free
roast beef sandwich, Bob.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.449
-But it was in a drawer. I, uh--
-Bob, please.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.052
This guy is pretty rich.
It'd be nice to work for him.

03:38.152 --> 03:40.187
But he can't know
that I got myself stuck.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.555
I'll-I'll get fired.

03:41.688 --> 03:43.357
He said he'd be back
in a few hours to check on me.

03:43.424 --> 03:44.791
Wait, how-how did you get stuck?

03:44.858 --> 03:46.126
Did you lock yourself inside?

03:46.159 --> 03:48.195
Well, you can't really
lock yourself inside.

03:48.295 --> 03:50.798
There's a release,
but I accidentally discovered

03:50.898 --> 03:52.366
a different way to get stuck.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.735
See, I brought down a bunch of
heavy sheet metal, a sheet-load.

03:54.801 --> 03:56.437
-They sell them in sheet-loads.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.639
-[Bob] Uh-huh.
-[Teddy] And I bought
a little too much

03:58.672 --> 04:00.374
'cause I wanted to be prepared.
Anyway,

04:00.441 --> 04:02.576
the extra sheet metal
was leaning against a chair,

04:02.609 --> 04:04.311
but I guess
it was a rocking chair,

04:04.411 --> 04:06.547
and the sheet metal
must have toppled over, and now

04:06.614 --> 04:08.348
it's pinning
the door closed real good.

04:08.448 --> 04:11.318
Like, real good. I-I gave it
everything I had, Bob.

04:11.384 --> 04:12.686
I almost threw my shoulder out.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.021
It is not budging.

04:14.088 --> 04:16.057
And you're sure your phone
can't just, like,

04:16.123 --> 04:17.190
tell us where you are?

04:17.257 --> 04:19.059
Gerald made me erase
all my map apps

04:19.125 --> 04:21.628
and a-a bunch of other apps
before I came here.

04:21.728 --> 04:22.863
Can you download them again?

04:22.930 --> 04:24.598
I tried. Nothing will download.

04:24.664 --> 04:26.700
I'm lucky I have enough signal
to get through to you.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.835
-Mm.
-So you just have to
somehow find me,

04:28.902 --> 04:31.204
move the sheet metal,
and then I can get out of here.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.874
Teddy, I feel like anybody
would be better at this than me.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.676
No, Bob, you're-you're
the guy for this.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.944
-You're the smartest guy I know.
-[sighs] Teddy, I couldn't even

04:38.011 --> 04:39.512
help my 11-year-old
with his homework.

04:39.579 --> 04:41.348
Gene was doing homework?
That's new.

04:41.415 --> 04:42.950
Please can-can we just
call a, like,

04:43.017 --> 04:45.485
a pr-a professional
person... getter-outer?

04:45.519 --> 04:48.388
911 people?
They-they do this kind of thing.

04:48.421 --> 04:49.623
-I don't.
-No, no, no, no, no.

04:49.689 --> 04:50.958
It has to be you, Bob.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.360
I need this Gerald connection.
We're not all

04:53.427 --> 04:54.995
economically comfortable
like you are.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.930
Teddy, I'm not...
[sighs] Okay.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.032
-All right, I'll-I'll try.
-You will?

04:59.132 --> 05:01.035
Thank you, Bob.
Thank you so much.

05:01.102 --> 05:02.702
Also, I should tell you
that my phone

05:02.836 --> 05:04.137
is almost out of battery life.

05:04.238 --> 05:05.372
-What?!
-Yeah.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.707
Why'd you tell me
the whole long story

05:06.774 --> 05:08.041
about the sandwich in the drawer

05:08.108 --> 05:09.977
if you're running out
of battery in a safe?

05:10.010 --> 05:11.645
-Context.
-Okay, just hang up.

05:11.745 --> 05:12.946
I'm gonna tell my family

05:12.980 --> 05:15.549
about this very normal thing
I'm about to do.

05:15.615 --> 05:17.651
-Oh, you're listening.
-And I'm coming with you.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.354
I have a certain set of skills.
I will find him.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.256
Yeah, I want to help
rescue Teddy from a safe.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.724
Me too.
And after we save him,

05:23.824 --> 05:24.992
we can all go out for dumplings.

05:25.059 --> 05:26.160
No, wait-- fudge.

05:26.260 --> 05:27.694
Kids, it's nice
you want to come, but, uh,

05:27.794 --> 05:29.897
I don't think this is even
really safe for me to do.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.732
Uh, I can't bring you.
I-I'm sorry.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.200
That is ridiculous.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.468
We never get to rescue anyone
from inside a safe.

05:35.535 --> 05:36.970
[Teddy]
Bob, did you say goodbye?

05:37.037 --> 05:38.372
-I couldn't hear you.
-Teddy, hang up.

05:38.439 --> 05:39.707
Yup. Sorry. Hanging up.
Miss you.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.474
See you soon. Got to go.

05:45.545 --> 05:46.747
Okay, Teddy, I'm here.
Uh, I'm at the lot.

05:46.847 --> 05:47.981
I-I see your truck.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.550
This still seems
like a terrible idea,

05:49.617 --> 05:51.418
but if I'm gonna have
any chance of finding you,

05:51.485 --> 05:52.886
you need to tell me
everything you remember

05:52.953 --> 05:54.487
about your drive with Gerald.

05:54.554 --> 05:55.989
And talk fast 'cause I don't
know how much battery

05:56.056 --> 05:56.957
you have left.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.259
Uh, like, 20%?
No, wait, 15%.

05:59.326 --> 06:01.261
[sighs]
That's not as good as 20%.

06:01.328 --> 06:03.730
-See how smart you are, Bob?
-Just talk, Teddy.

06:03.830 --> 06:04.765
So, I got in his truck

06:04.865 --> 06:06.266
and he blindfolded me,

06:06.333 --> 06:08.903
and not in a scary way.
I-I mean, I was a little scared,

06:08.969 --> 06:09.870
but it's fine. I'm fine.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.006
Mm. Do you remember
which way you turned out

06:12.106 --> 06:13.307
of the parking lot?

06:13.373 --> 06:14.708
Uh, I'm pretty sure
we made a right.

06:14.775 --> 06:15.976
Uh, all right. What else?

06:16.043 --> 06:16.810
Hm, let's see, uh,

06:16.943 --> 06:18.479
he was listening
to the radio. Oldies.

06:18.546 --> 06:21.181
That song "Judy in Disguise"
came on

06:21.248 --> 06:22.682
as we pulled out
of the parking lot,

06:22.782 --> 06:25.085
and he was kind of singing
along. You know that song?

06:25.151 --> 06:26.953
Uh, I don't. Uh, keep going,

06:27.020 --> 06:28.688
but try to say
more helpful things.

06:28.788 --> 06:30.791
-Not about music.
-Right. Uh, I think we were on

06:30.858 --> 06:33.293
a normal road at the beginning
'cause it was smooth.

06:33.426 --> 06:35.095
-You know, like a road.
-[Bob] Okay.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.263
Yeah, but then,

06:36.363 --> 06:38.165
I think we turned right again,

06:38.298 --> 06:39.533
and it got really bumpy,

06:39.600 --> 06:41.068
and the chorus
of the song came on,

06:41.135 --> 06:42.636
and it made Gerald's voice
sound crazy.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.237
Like, uh, ♪ Judy in disguise ♪

06:44.304 --> 06:47.408
-♪ With glasses. ♪
-Mm-hmm. Okay, anything else?

06:47.474 --> 06:49.409
It-it doesn't have to be
about that song at all.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.211
Oh, at some point,
Gerald put on

06:51.278 --> 06:52.612
this really nice aftershave.

06:52.712 --> 06:53.847
While he was driving?

06:53.947 --> 06:55.316
Yeah, he must've
opened a bottle of it

06:55.382 --> 06:56.951
and splashed it on his face.

06:57.018 --> 06:58.119
Okay. That's odd.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.686
Well, whatever it was,
all of a sudden,

06:59.753 --> 07:01.455
the inside of the truck
smelled incredible.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.591
And then, like,
right after the aftershave,

07:03.657 --> 07:04.691
he parked, and then he

07:04.791 --> 07:05.792
let me out of the truck,

07:05.892 --> 07:07.161
and he walked me through a yard

07:07.261 --> 07:09.029
to a staircase
and down into the bunker.

07:09.129 --> 07:11.532
Uh, okay, so you turned right
and then right again

07:11.599 --> 07:13.967
and then Gerald was singing
"Judy in Disguise."

07:14.034 --> 07:16.169
-Yup.
-And then he put on aftershave.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.738
-Yeah.
-Okay, great.

07:17.838 --> 07:18.972
-Oh! Wait!
-What?

07:19.039 --> 07:20.574
What-what if I
download that song

07:20.640 --> 07:23.477
and start driving and
when they sing the glasses part,

07:23.510 --> 07:25.546
I look for a bumpy road
on the right

07:25.613 --> 07:26.513
and turn onto it?

07:26.580 --> 07:28.415
[chuckles] Unbelievable.
That's so smart.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.150
The song will be
like a road map.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.886
So the song turns out to be
pretty helpful information.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.355
You made it sound like
it wasn't.

07:34.421 --> 07:36.390
Sorry, yes,
it was helpful information.

07:36.457 --> 07:38.225
Uh, okay.
I'm gonna download the song.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.560
I-I think my phone does that.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.061
And then and then
I'll call you right back.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.262
Okay, I'm gonna
download it, too.

07:42.362 --> 07:43.631
I-I want to listen to it.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.399
Damn, I can't do that.
Not enough bars.

07:45.532 --> 07:47.834
-Uh-oh. I'm down
to nine percent, Bobby.
-Okay, hang up.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.570
-Y-You have to save
your battery.
-Right, right,

07:49.670 --> 07:51.171
but do you want me
to stay on the line

07:51.238 --> 07:52.973
and walk you through
the download process?

07:53.040 --> 07:54.041
No, Teddy. Hang up.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.942
You just seemed nervous
about the downloading.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.144
[breaking up]
Hang the... up, Teddy.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.311
What? You're breaking up.

07:58.378 --> 07:59.513
Bob? Bob?

07:59.613 --> 08:00.948
Bob? Oh, you're gone.

08:01.015 --> 08:02.849
Good thing
I'm not claustrophobic.

08:02.916 --> 08:03.717
Or am I? Eh...

08:03.783 --> 08:05.886
I just realized
I'm claustrophobic.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.422
Aah!
I'm claustrophobic!

08:08.489 --> 08:10.657
Okay, I'm stopping with
the math. I'm angry at it

08:10.757 --> 08:12.860
and I think I'm gonna give it
the silent treatment for a while

08:12.993 --> 08:14.328
-and see if that works.
-[entry bell jingles]

08:14.395 --> 08:16.430
Hi. Welcome to Bob's Burgers.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.532
-Oh, good, you're not busy.
-That's our slogan.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.767
Hang on a second.
They're wide open in here!

08:20.900 --> 08:22.435
-[whoops]
-Yeah!
-We just won

08:22.502 --> 08:25.005
the Over-40 Co-ed Rec League
Basketball tournament.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.007
-Yeah, we did!
-Right on, right on.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.476
We're celebrating
and we're starving.

08:29.543 --> 08:31.745
Over 40 and still sporty.
I love it.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.113
Take some menus. Sit anywhere.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.549
-I'll get some fries, maybe.
-Yeah.
-[gasps]

08:35.649 --> 08:38.252
Um, quick family meeting
in the kitchen, please?

08:38.319 --> 08:39.586
I think the stars are aligning.

08:39.653 --> 08:42.489
Dad is gone.
Seven hungry customers walk in.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.491
I think the day
has finally come.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.426
-We pick a new lover for Mom?
-No.

08:46.460 --> 08:48.529
-Boo.
-We sell them on the greatest,

08:48.629 --> 08:51.231
biggest, most exciting
form of group celebration:

08:51.298 --> 08:52.899
[echoing] the Beef-hemoth.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.236
-Oh, my God. Yes.
-Yes, yes, yes, yes!

08:55.336 --> 08:56.270
Oh, boy.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.172
-[echoing] The Beef-hemoth!
-Yes!

08:58.239 --> 08:59.440
Aka Beef-alo Bill.

08:59.507 --> 09:01.641
Aka the Patty
the Size of Cincinnati.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.877
Whatever you call it,
it's the burger that breaks

09:03.978 --> 09:05.812
the world record
for biggest burger ever.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.248
What do you say? Should we
make some dreams come true?

09:08.315 --> 09:10.551
Uh, your dad
never loved that dream.

09:10.617 --> 09:13.520
-Because he's a hater.
-And probably so jealous.

09:13.587 --> 09:14.921
Also, I don't think
you're gonna break

09:14.988 --> 09:16.523
the world record.
Just looking up...

09:16.590 --> 09:18.358
Yup. You're not gonna
break the world record.

09:18.425 --> 09:19.627
-Another hater.
-Stop that.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.028
And nobody's gonna
be able to finish it.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.896
It's too much food.
It's wasteful.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.498
I've never heard
of too much food.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.500
We promise,
none of it will go to waste.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.268
How do we even charge
for this kind of thing?

09:28.335 --> 09:31.271
-We're gonna lose money on it.
-Isn't that what we normally do?

09:31.338 --> 09:33.006
Eh, kind of.
What about the giant bun?

09:33.106 --> 09:34.574
Mom, we've already
thought this through.

09:34.641 --> 09:37.444
The bakery around the corner
has a huge loaf of bread

09:37.511 --> 09:39.079
that they always put
in the window display.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.648
It'll be perfect.
So, if they want to order it,

09:41.715 --> 09:43.017
can we make it?

09:43.117 --> 09:44.150
-Please?
-Please!

09:44.250 --> 09:45.386
-Please, please, please.
-Say yes!

09:45.452 --> 09:46.286
Okay, fine.

09:46.386 --> 09:47.421
-Yay!
-Yes!
-Yes!

09:47.487 --> 09:48.521
Beef...

09:48.588 --> 09:50.557
-Calm down, calm down.
-...hemoth.

09:50.657 --> 09:52.325
So, what do you say?

09:52.425 --> 09:54.561
Can we put you down
for the Beef-hemoth?

09:54.628 --> 09:56.396
-Let's do it!
-Yeah!
-Damn straight!

09:56.463 --> 09:57.898
-Great.
-But this isn't like the thing

09:57.998 --> 09:59.599
where, if you finish it,
you get it for free.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.802
-You just have to finish it.
-Or our daddy will be angry.

10:01.902 --> 10:05.372
And you do not want our daddy
to be angry. It's very awkward.

10:05.473 --> 10:06.807
His face gets red.

10:06.874 --> 10:08.375
[sighs] Damn it.

10:08.475 --> 10:09.676
Oh, wait.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.011
-[laughs] Oh.
-[phone rings]

10:11.077 --> 10:12.746
-Hello? Hang on.
-[Teddy] Hello?

10:12.846 --> 10:14.581
-Uh, hi.
-Are you at the dirt road?

10:14.648 --> 10:16.683
No. Sorry.
I-I just got it downloaded.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.952
I've never downloaded anything
on my phone before.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.420
-I think it was surprised.
-Play it.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.255
I should hang up because
of your battery, Teddy.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.657
No, Bob. Try it, please.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.092
I need the human connection
right now.

10:25.159 --> 10:26.760
I might be having
a panic attack.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.096
I can't tell 'cause
I've never had one before

10:29.163 --> 10:31.331
-or I'm always having one.
-Uh, okay, okay.

10:31.432 --> 10:34.402
I-I'll try. Uh, uh, all right,
putting you on speakerphone.

10:34.468 --> 10:35.536
I am...

10:35.602 --> 10:38.672
pulling out of the lot
and pressing play.

10:38.738 --> 10:39.840
["Judy in Disguise" playing]

10:39.940 --> 10:41.308
-It's a toe-tapper, right?
-Uh,

10:41.408 --> 10:43.577
I can't really focus
on that right now.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.112
No, no, no!

10:45.178 --> 10:46.847
A tractor just pulled out
in front of me.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.515
-I-I got to slow way down.
-What?

10:48.582 --> 10:50.317
Bob, no!
The "with glasses" part

10:50.384 --> 10:52.519
is gonna come on and you
won't know where to turn.

10:52.586 --> 10:54.254
-Teddy, I know.
-Can you pass it?

10:54.321 --> 10:56.690
No. There are cars coming
the other way that will hit me,

10:56.757 --> 10:59.359
-and I-I won't like that.
-Well, try honking.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.195
I don't like honking at people.

11:01.262 --> 11:03.764
Just give the horn
a little friendly tap.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.599
-Ugh, fine.
-[horn honks]

11:05.732 --> 11:06.633
Bob, don't pound on it.

11:06.767 --> 11:07.734
I barely touched it.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.869
Wait, he's pulling over.
Yes!

11:09.970 --> 11:12.239
Thank you. Sorry.
Uh, cool tractor.

11:12.306 --> 11:14.608
Bob, you got to speed up. You
got to make up for lost time.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.543
Okay, Teddy. "With glasses."

11:16.643 --> 11:18.512
He just said, "with glasses."
Oh, gosh.

11:18.578 --> 11:20.681
Uh, I don't know
if this plan is gonna work now.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.115
Oh. I see a right turn ahead.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.917
-D-Do you think that's it?
-I'm in a bunker, Bob.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.585
-I don't know.
-It-It's a dirt road.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.721
-L-Like you said. [grunts]
-Take it!

11:27.821 --> 11:29.723
Oh, yeah. Bumpy road.

11:29.790 --> 11:30.957
-You did it. You did it.
-Yes!

11:31.058 --> 11:33.160
Oh, that's too bumpy.
Slowing down.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.161
-Oh, no.
-What?

11:34.261 --> 11:35.296
No, no, no, no, no.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.530
What? What? Wh-What is it?

11:36.596 --> 11:37.598
Teddy, the road splits

11:37.664 --> 11:38.632
into three different roads.

11:38.732 --> 11:39.834
How do I know where to go?

11:39.900 --> 11:41.101
I don't know how to choose.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.903
You know what you do...
You just--

11:43.003 --> 11:44.037
Teddy? Teddy?

11:44.204 --> 11:46.773
Oh, no. Oh, my God. Did your
phone run out of batteries?

-This is a good song.

[Bob]
Oh, come on, which road
did you take, Teddy?

11:56.650 --> 11:58.151
Uh, maybe I can get out

11:58.285 --> 12:00.354
and look for fresh tire tracks?

12:00.421 --> 12:02.623
Nope. That's not something
I know how to do.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.024
This just looks like dirt.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.359
[Louise]
It's so big.

12:05.426 --> 12:06.927
It's so much meat in one place.

12:06.993 --> 12:08.963
I think it has
its own gravitational pull.

12:09.063 --> 12:10.531
-Are we orbiting it?
-I feel it.

12:10.598 --> 12:12.399
Listen, kids,
I like the Beefy Moth.

12:12.466 --> 12:14.768

Yeah, sure, sure. It's just,
how are we gonna flip it?

-Uh, we haven't worked
that part out yet.
-What?

12:19.406 --> 12:21.608
-Well, how do you flip Dad?
We'll just go from there.
-[phone rings]

12:21.675 --> 12:23.744
Oh, speaking of your Dad,
he's calling. Hey.

How's the rescue mission going?

12:25.012 --> 12:26.580
Well, Teddy's
phone battery died

12:26.680 --> 12:28.048
and I have no idea where to go.

12:28.114 --> 12:30.785
-Oh, no.
-Ugh, why did Teddy
think I could do this?

12:30.818 --> 12:34.121
-'Cause you can. I know you can.
-Uh-huh, but what if I can't?

12:34.188 --> 12:36.122
Well, don't say that.
That's not gonna help.

12:36.222 --> 12:38.125
That thought's gonna crowd out
all the smart thoughts

12:38.192 --> 12:40.093
you're about to have.
Say something smart.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.563
Like... Oh, um, how would you
flip a giant burger?

12:42.663 --> 12:45.332
Oh, God. They didn't make
the giant burger, did they?

12:45.432 --> 12:46.433
Who would agree to eat that?

12:46.466 --> 12:48.535
An over-40 co-ed
basketball team.

12:48.602 --> 12:49.636
They're excited about it.

12:49.703 --> 12:51.105
Seriously? Oh. A truck's coming.

12:51.172 --> 12:52.539
-I should ask them something.
-Wait, Bob,

-we have to flip the burger,
-Okay, good luck.

Hey. Hey! Uh, excuse me.

to find a-a friend, though.

13:08.722 --> 13:09.990
Well, I'm flattered, but--

13:10.090 --> 13:13.060
Sorry. I mean,
I'm-I'm looking for a friend.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.428
He... His phone died,

13:14.495 --> 13:16.263
but he-he's up
one of these roads, so...

13:16.363 --> 13:17.797
Oh. Well, I didn't see anyone.

13:17.864 --> 13:19.933
Uh, are-are there houses
up that way?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.902
Yeah. Does your friend
live in a house?

13:21.968 --> 13:25.372
Oh. No. He's, uh,
doing some work in one,

13:25.472 --> 13:26.207
or near one.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.108
Okay, well, good luck.

we were done talking.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.514
Sorry. I smell aftershave.
Is that-is that you?

13:34.581 --> 13:35.515
Well, kind of.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.318
It's witch hazel.
It grows up the road,

13:37.384 --> 13:38.886
and it blooms in the winter.

13:38.953 --> 13:40.987
Uh, is-is witch-hazel
used in aftershave?

13:41.054 --> 13:42.089
Uh, yeah.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.257
Oh, my God. That's it.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.324
That-That's the smell.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.694
of witch hazel.

13:47.761 --> 13:48.962
Uh, okay. Sure.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.164
Does it grow anywhere else
around here?

13:50.264 --> 13:51.965
Um... Well, not that I know of.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.867
-Just back up there.
-Yes! Thanks.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.202
You're really excited
about this.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.170
I am. Y-You just
helped me out a lot.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.839
Thank you, guy in truck.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.307
Sorry, I-I didn't get your name.

14:00.407 --> 14:01.542
You don't need to know my name.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.611
I'm just gonna drive away
from you now.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.545
Thank you. Thank you.

14:07.481 --> 14:08.849
Okay, this is it.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.484
This is why
you gave birth to us, Mom.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.485
-Eh...
-We're about to use
two baking sheets

14:12.552 --> 14:15.156
and four spatulas to try
to flip what I'm assuming

14:15.256 --> 14:17.724
is 100 to 1,000 pounds of beef.

14:17.791 --> 14:19.125
Some of us might not make it.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.460
-Uh...
-Oh, my.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.029
But just know
this burger will be our legacy.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.131
Why do Mom and Tina
get safety goggles?

14:24.198 --> 14:25.466
They're just our glasses.

14:25.566 --> 14:26.600
You lucky nerds.

14:26.734 --> 14:28.035
All right, let's make history.

14:28.102 --> 14:29.436
We flip on three.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.038
One, two,

14:31.105 --> 14:32.373
-three!
-[all grunt]

14:32.440 --> 14:34.775
-All right!
-[laughs]
-[cheers]

14:34.875 --> 14:35.976
It's like what we do every day,

14:36.043 --> 14:37.077
but for some reason
it's fun now.

14:37.144 --> 14:38.178
'Cause it's big.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.246
[Deb]
How's it going in there?

14:39.313 --> 14:40.313
-We moving along?
-Uh...

14:40.413 --> 14:41.848
great. It-It's going great.

14:41.948 --> 14:43.851
We're pretty hungry.
Like, really hungry.

14:43.951 --> 14:45.519
We're not sad
about how long it's taking,

14:45.586 --> 14:47.420
but we are sad
that we don't have food.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.422
[weak chuckle]
It's gonna be out real soon.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.291
-Uh, too soon.
-Oh crap, the bun!

14:51.358 --> 14:52.792
Mom, money.
I'll go to the bakery

14:52.859 --> 14:54.027
-and get the giant loaf.
-Okay.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.063
-Is that a euphemism? Sorry.
-Oh, uh,

14:56.163 --> 14:57.530
basketball players, uh,

14:57.597 --> 15:00.033
you're-you're gonna be so happy
in just a few moments.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.536
-We are almost there.
-Hi. Hi. Sorry, bye.

15:02.603 --> 15:03.637
[entry bell jingles]

15:03.737 --> 15:05.372
[sniffs]
Come on, witch hazel.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.308
[sniffs]
Wait, I think I smell it.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.677
[sniffs] Ooh,
I definitely smell it. Ha!

15:09.743 --> 15:13.380
There it is! Oh, my God.
That must be the house.

15:13.447 --> 15:14.614
Okay, no truck.

15:14.681 --> 15:17.083
Uh, maybe Gerald isn't here.
That-that would be good.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.986
Hm, I don't like
parking so close

15:19.052 --> 15:20.087
in case he has cameras

15:20.187 --> 15:23.590
and he looks up my license plate
and comes to kill me.

15:23.657 --> 15:26.159
Uh, maybe I'll park
a little down the road?

15:26.226 --> 15:29.530
[panting] Maybe that was,
uh, too far down the road.

15:29.597 --> 15:33.134
Whew! Uh, all right.
Bunker, bunker.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.601
Looking for a bunker.

15:34.668 --> 15:37.805
Weird, scary, rusty hammer
on the ground. Ignoring that.

15:37.905 --> 15:39.406
Where is the bunker?
[gasps]

15:39.506 --> 15:42.009
Teddy? Teddy?
Are you down there?

15:42.109 --> 15:44.445
Oh, God, I hope
this is the right bunker.

15:44.512 --> 15:45.879
[grunts]

15:45.946 --> 15:48.481
I'm sorry if I'm in the wrong
bunker. Please don't hurt me.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.385
-Teddy? Teddy?
-[Teddy] Oh, my God!

15:51.452 --> 15:53.020
-Bob, is that you?
-It's me!

15:53.120 --> 15:55.155
-[Teddy] You found me!
-[laughs] I found you!

15:55.255 --> 15:57.558
-It's-it's a pretty nice bunker.
-[Teddy] I know, right?

15:57.625 --> 15:59.626
Okay. I'm gonna
move the sheet metal

15:59.693 --> 16:01.695
-so you can get out.
-[Teddy] Gloves, Bob!

16:01.762 --> 16:02.930
-Gloves!
-Oh! So sharp.

16:02.997 --> 16:04.899
[Teddy]
Gloves! Put on my gloves!

16:04.999 --> 16:07.434
Oh, gloves. Great.
[sighs]

16:07.501 --> 16:08.402
[grunts]

16:08.502 --> 16:12.273
Okay, I'm doing this.
[straining]

16:12.339 --> 16:13.340
Okay.

16:13.407 --> 16:15.142
[Bob straining]

16:15.242 --> 16:16.943
I moved it. I did it.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.745
-I'm free. Oh, my God.
-[laughing]

16:18.879 --> 16:21.414
-I knew you could do it.
-[grunts] Yeah.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.116
I always believed in you,
even when I stopped

16:23.150 --> 16:24.284
believing in you a little bit.

16:24.384 --> 16:25.685
It's kind of amazing
what happened.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.888
After I talked to you,
a truck drove by and--

16:27.988 --> 16:29.523
Yeah, o-okay, Bob,
I-I hate to cut you off,

16:29.589 --> 16:31.792
and I know you just got here,
but you got to leave.

16:31.892 --> 16:33.093
-What?
-You got to get out of here.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.295
Gerald could be back any minute.

16:34.428 --> 16:35.796
Hey, great seeing you,
though, pal.

16:35.896 --> 16:37.064
Right, okay, right, right.
Okay, uh...

16:37.131 --> 16:38.532
-You got to go.
-Yeah. I-I'm-I'm, uh...

16:38.632 --> 16:39.533
Thanks a lot, though.

16:39.633 --> 16:40.668
Big help. [chuckles]

16:40.768 --> 16:42.436
-I owe you one.
-Okay, bye.

16:42.536 --> 16:44.071
-Take it easy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Teddy, charge your phone.

16:44.171 --> 16:45.306
And call me when you get home,

16:45.406 --> 16:46.406
-so I know you're safe.
-Bye, Bob.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.708
Oh, God.

16:47.775 --> 16:48.875
[truck door opens]

16:48.975 --> 16:50.177
Someone's here.
Red truck.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.145
What?
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.514
Oh, my God, that's Gerald.

16:53.581 --> 16:55.148
You can't be here.
What do we do? What do we do?

16:55.215 --> 16:57.318
-I don't-- I-I don't know.
-Hide inside my shirt?

16:57.385 --> 16:58.985
-No. I-I don't think so.
-In my pants?

16:59.052 --> 17:00.521
-No.
-Put a lampshade on your head?

17:00.621 --> 17:02.189
-No!
-I'm the only one
coming up with stuff.

17:02.256 --> 17:03.423
You're not coming up with stuff.

17:03.557 --> 17:05.025
You're just saying things
you're seeing.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.627
Okay, well,
while you're thinking,

17:06.694 --> 17:08.562
I'm just gonna gently put
the lampshade on your head.

17:08.662 --> 17:10.497
-Teddy, no. No, no, no, no, no.
-[shushing]

17:14.935 --> 17:16.537
[Teddy]
What are we gonna do?

17:16.603 --> 17:18.104
He can't find you here.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.540
-I know.
-We don't have any time.

17:19.607 --> 17:21.508
I know that.
Stop saying stressful things.

17:21.542 --> 17:24.411
Wait. I'm, uh...
I-I think I have an idea.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.146
The shirt thing?
I'll start unbuttoning.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.414
Not the shirt thing.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.616
[Linda]
Oh, my God, so much cheese.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.018
It's like a cheese blanket.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.553
-[entry bell jingles]
-Sleep tight, giant burger.

17:32.653 --> 17:34.054
-[Tina panting]
-Ooh, ooh, I think Tina's back.

17:34.155 --> 17:35.456
She sounds great.

17:35.489 --> 17:36.524
[panting]

17:36.590 --> 17:38.692
Tina, where's the bun?

17:38.759 --> 17:41.328
It's plastic! It's not real.
It's just for display.

17:41.395 --> 17:42.830
And they said it would
taste terrible.

17:42.897 --> 17:44.331
Because it's plastic.
And I tried it.

17:44.398 --> 17:45.666
-They were right.
-Damn it!

17:45.766 --> 17:47.300
Quick, Mom, bake us a giant bun!

17:47.400 --> 17:48.535
I don't know how to do that.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.537
Wait, what if we just use
our regular buns?

17:50.637 --> 17:53.139
Well, I don't know, Tina,
because they're way too small!

17:53.240 --> 17:55.876
-This burger is giant.
-Uh, I don't mean
one little bun.

17:55.943 --> 17:57.511
I mean, I mean,
what if we use all of them.

17:57.578 --> 17:59.813
And layer them on top of
each other for extra thickness?

17:59.880 --> 18:01.381
Like-like
a giant mountain of buns?

18:01.448 --> 18:03.651
It's like your journal but
you're just saying it out loud.

18:03.718 --> 18:04.985
Okay. Giant burger

18:05.119 --> 18:08.121
inside of 100
little hamburger buns

18:08.188 --> 18:09.389
could actually work.

18:09.423 --> 18:11.592
It's kind of a metaphor
for humanity,

18:11.658 --> 18:12.692
if you don't think about it.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.227
-Let's do it.
-You're welcome.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.162
Teddy.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.730
[laughs] There he is.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.099
The man paying me for this.

18:18.165 --> 18:20.134
Yup. So, how's it going?

18:20.201 --> 18:21.835
Good. Great. Why?

18:21.902 --> 18:23.170
Doesn't it seem like
it's going great?

18:23.237 --> 18:24.738
I don't know. I just got here,

18:24.838 --> 18:26.206
and I asked, "How is it going?"

18:26.273 --> 18:28.542
[laughs] I guess I've been
down in this bunker for a while,

18:28.642 --> 18:31.678
so I must have forgotten
how people talk on the mainland.

18:31.745 --> 18:34.614
All right. Let's check out
what you've done so far.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.317
Great. Perfect. Why not?

18:36.417 --> 18:39.019
Sounds like a plan.
Let's open her up.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.625
[Gerald]
Looks good.
Looks like an empty safe.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.594
Yup. Eh, looks very empty.

18:47.661 --> 18:48.762
Good eye, good eye.

18:48.862 --> 18:50.297
I'm gonna open the secret part.

18:50.364 --> 18:51.599
-Do you have to?
-What?

18:51.699 --> 18:52.733
Yeah, no, sure.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.401
But it could be a fun surprise

18:54.468 --> 18:55.736
to just see it later,
though, right?

18:55.836 --> 18:57.137
I'd prefer to see it now.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.206
Okay. Open it up,
if that's what you want to do.

18:59.273 --> 19:02.209
[weak chuckle]
Uh, here we go.

19:04.879 --> 19:06.881
-Ta-da!
-[Gerald] Wow.

19:06.947 --> 19:08.815
-[Teddy] Uh... [chuckles]
-[Gerald] Mm...

19:08.882 --> 19:11.519
No one's gonna find you in here,
my little candy babies.

19:11.619 --> 19:12.986
Nope. [chuckles]

19:13.053 --> 19:13.920
Teddy, it's perfect.

19:14.021 --> 19:16.624
I love it almost as much
as I love my mother,

19:16.724 --> 19:17.858
who happens to steal from me.

19:17.958 --> 19:19.860
Okay. Well, uh,
I'm gonna paint it

19:19.927 --> 19:21.762
and then I'll be done, right?

19:21.829 --> 19:25.365
Mm-hmm. I'm gonna go the store
and buy some more bunker beans.

19:25.432 --> 19:26.634
Feel like I didn't get enough.

19:26.700 --> 19:27.701
Oh, yeah, look at that.

19:27.801 --> 19:29.570
There's barely any left. Yeah.

19:29.603 --> 19:31.338
-And, Teddy...
-Yes. Hi.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.006
-On the way home later...
-Yeah?

19:33.106 --> 19:35.810
Don't worry about wearing
the blindfold. You know why?

19:35.910 --> 19:37.978
-Why?
-I trust you.

19:38.045 --> 19:39.346
Oh. [chuckles]

19:39.413 --> 19:41.482
All right, new friend.
See you in a little bit.

19:41.582 --> 19:44.484
Okay. Take it easy.

19:46.119 --> 19:48.455
[whoops] It was tight
back there, but it worked.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.891
Yeah, it worked.
You just double fake walled him.

19:50.957 --> 19:52.960
I did.
I double fake walled him.

19:53.027 --> 19:54.194
You smart smartie.

19:54.261 --> 19:55.930
I'm just glad I brought
that extra sheet metal.

19:55.996 --> 19:58.498
I mean, that's how you got stuck
in the safe in the first place.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.167
Yeah, no, I know.
Don't ruin this.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.501
You're a genius, Bob.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.503
Yeah, I feel kind of smart,
maybe. A little.

20:03.604 --> 20:05.272
I-I should...
I should probably leave

20:05.372 --> 20:07.441
-before Gerald comes back
with the beans.
-Good idea.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.410
I knew I asked the right person
to come help me.

20:09.477 --> 20:11.345
-Thanks, Teddy.
-Yeah. Mort didn't answer.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.913
What?
Y-You called Mort first?

20:13.013 --> 20:14.415
-No.
-Didn't you just say--

20:14.515 --> 20:16.350
-Nope.
-But I heard you say Mor--

20:16.417 --> 20:17.951
-No, you didn't.
-You know what? Fine.

20:18.018 --> 20:20.521
Whatever. I found you,
and I hid in the thing.

20:20.621 --> 20:23.323
Mort's never
double fake walled anyone.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.858
That's why I didn't call him.

20:24.925 --> 20:26.760
[Bob]
So, the answer is...

20:26.860 --> 20:28.128
-twelve.
-That doesn't seem right.

20:28.195 --> 20:30.130
Yeah, you know what,
I'm feeling smart today.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.565
Let's just say it's 12.

20:31.632 --> 20:33.768
-More Beef-hemoth, anyone?
-Oh, yes, please.

20:33.834 --> 20:35.035
I'll take nine pounds.

20:35.101 --> 20:36.836
This is why I was worried
about the Beef-hemoth.

20:36.903 --> 20:41.208
-Why?
-Because now we have to eat
a giant hamburger

20:41.275 --> 20:42.542
so it doesn't go to waste.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.211
You don't sound smart
at all right now.

20:44.278 --> 20:46.012
