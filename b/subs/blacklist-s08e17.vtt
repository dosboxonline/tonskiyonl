-A thief.

I know who you are.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.718
One job. That's all I need.

00:09.801 --> 00:13.221
If Townsend knew we were even talking,
I doubt he'd be so understanding.

00:13.304 --> 00:15.265
We're aligned against Reddington.

00:15.348 --> 00:17.058
We're all against Reddington.

00:17.142 --> 00:20.311
-She and the feds are against us.
-Not what I heard.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.981
Our friend. He's been taken.

00:23.064 --> 00:25.525
[Townsend] Do you know who I am?
I know who you are.

00:25.608 --> 00:28.403
You created the archive
that destroyed my family.

00:28.486 --> 00:29.738
What do I have to steal?

00:29.821 --> 00:33.199
I want you to infiltrate
Neville Townsend's organization.

00:33.283 --> 00:34.492
Priya Laghari.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.120

<i>A state of threshold consciousness</i>

00:56.014 --> 00:58.266
Where you experience lucid dreams.

00:58.349 --> 01:01.352
Some people call them
hypnagogic hallucinations.

01:01.436 --> 01:04.189
I call them an acid trip without the acid.

So if the general's in a meeting,
pull him out.

03:20.533 --> 03:21.868
You spoke with Klebanov?

03:21.951 --> 03:25.288
Yes. And Dragic.
They think there's a purge in the ranks.

03:25.371 --> 03:26.956
This isn't about that.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.666
-Stepanov has enemies.
-What?

03:28.750 --> 03:32.754
He can't be reached. Fine.
When he can be, tell him he's off payroll.

-This may be a domestic dispute.
-It's not.

We both know who did this.

03:42.847 --> 03:44.515
Elizabeth or Townsend.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.601
Have you heard from Laghari?

03:48.645 --> 03:50.104
I need to speak to him.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.900
No. You speak with me
and I speak with him.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.694
Mr. Townsend is a stickler
for chain of command.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.446
He can spare five minutes.

03:58.529 --> 04:01.032
Or he can find someone else
to do this job.

04:01.115 --> 04:02.450
I'm a stickler too.

04:02.533 --> 04:04.202
She can't get too close to Townsend.

04:04.285 --> 04:08.414
She's only there to get close to Townsend.
She can't kill him with a thought bubble.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.795
It's Harold. He's here.
Involving the task force is a mistake.

04:13.878 --> 04:16.547
If Townsend has Ivan, Ivan will talk.

04:16.631 --> 04:18.758
And if Harold gets him, he won't?

04:18.841 --> 04:21.552
What Stepanov has to say,
you don't want anyone to hear.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.638
We should extract him ourselves.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.723
We should. But I'm not convinced we can.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.601
Given what's at stake,
we need all the help we can get.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.730
Thank you for coming quickly, Harold.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.315
You made it sound urgent.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.733
An urgent opportunity.

04:36.234 --> 04:39.988
To acquire a treasure trove
of Russian intelligence.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.948
-Was someone turned?
-[Dembe] Abducted.

04:42.031 --> 04:44.826
-Ivan Stepanov.
-Who's that?

04:44.909 --> 04:47.161
[Raymond] Stepanov is Zaslon.

04:47.245 --> 04:51.874
The most elite, most secretive,
most lethal branch of the SVR.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.711
Stepanov knows
where all the bodies are buried

04:54.794 --> 04:56.754
because he buried them.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.756
You said he was abducted. Any leads?

04:58.840 --> 05:01.718
I know where he was taken from and when.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.553
Everything else is suspicion.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.430
I don't know anything more.

05:05.513 --> 05:08.683
Nothing?
How about a healthy sense of irony?

05:08.766 --> 05:12.645
You know the irony of "irony"? It's a word
you understand but can't possibly define.

05:12.729 --> 05:16.441
I can. You asking me
to find a missing Russian spymaster.

05:16.524 --> 05:19.485
Or perhaps you letting
a wildly inaccurate assessment of me

05:19.569 --> 05:22.447
get in the way of finding a man
who can divulge secrets

05:22.530 --> 05:25.033
of one of this country's
principal adversaries.

05:25.116 --> 05:27.327
-The ironies abound.
-They do.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.246
The question is,
what are we gonna do about them?

05:31.831 --> 05:34.584
-[Cooper] We're gonna do nothing.
-You told him that?

05:34.667 --> 05:36.127
I told him we'd look into it.

05:36.210 --> 05:39.380
Which we will as soon as Elizabeth gets
the answers she's looking for.

05:39.464 --> 05:42.842
Mr. Reddington really acted as if he
and Stepanov didn't know each other?

05:42.925 --> 05:46.345
He did. And I acted as if I didn't know
that Stepanov was his handler.

05:46.429 --> 05:51.059
Okay. Let's say Liz gets Stepanov
to admit he works with Mr. Reddington.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.728
-What does that prove?
-Besides that he's a traitor?

05:53.811 --> 05:56.814
He's a facilitator.
The concierge of crime.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.442
He's built an empire by not taking sides.

05:59.525 --> 06:03.821
Look, I know he's probably N-13,
which means he traffics in stolen intel.

06:03.905 --> 06:07.075
I also know it's a safe bet
he used some of that intel

06:07.158 --> 06:09.494
to give us over 150 Blacklisters,

06:09.577 --> 06:13.414
most of whom were committing crimes
either in this country or against it.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.458
[phone rings]

06:16.209 --> 06:17.043
This is Park.

06:17.126 --> 06:19.837
Are we talking about arresting him
or giving him a medal?

06:19.921 --> 06:22.924
Neither.
Our next move depends entirely on Keen.

06:23.007 --> 06:25.635
She's on line one. Keen.
The operator patched her through.

06:27.887 --> 06:28.721
We're here.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.808
-Do you have Stepanov?
-[Cooper] <i>Us? We sent you.</i>

06:31.891 --> 06:33.351
I thought you got cold feet.

06:33.434 --> 06:35.853
Decided I couldn't be trusted.
Got him yourselves.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.730
Are you saying that you don't have him?

06:37.814 --> 06:40.358
<i>I sent a team.</i>
<i>By the time they got there, he was gone.</i>

06:40.441 --> 06:41.400
Townsend take him?

06:41.484 --> 06:43.861
I don't know how. I never said anything.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.863
Stepanov's a Zaslon agent. He has enemies,

06:45.947 --> 06:48.574
but it's hard to believe
one of them happened to abduct him

06:48.658 --> 06:49.784
right out from under us.

06:49.867 --> 06:52.829
The intel we shared with you,
about how to find Stepanov,

06:52.912 --> 06:54.580
you didn't share that with Townsend?

06:54.664 --> 06:56.290
-You told me not to.
<i>-I did.</i>

06:56.374 --> 06:59.043
These days, when I say stop,
you usually go.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.461
I didn't say anything.

07:00.545 --> 07:03.256
If he hacked information,
it wasn't from me. I'm offline.

07:03.339 --> 07:06.759
-You're talking on a cell.
<i>-On a burner I change every day.</i>

07:06.843 --> 07:08.886
If he wanted to hack my phone,
he couldn't.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.431
This line has NSA-approved
end-to-end encryption.

07:11.514 --> 07:14.308
You didn't share the information
any other way?

07:14.392 --> 07:17.186
Yeah, to me.
But that was on my bureau cell.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.314
There's gotta be a different explanation.

07:20.398 --> 07:23.276
For Townsend to hack into my phone,
it means he knows who I am

07:23.359 --> 07:24.861
and was able to access it

07:24.944 --> 07:28.531
or have Tech Services issue me a phone
with malware already installed.

07:28.614 --> 07:29.991
Pretty hard to believe.

07:30.074 --> 07:34.829
Well, Mr. Ripley, believe it or not.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.500
That means Townsend has Stepanov.

07:39.584 --> 07:43.045
Call the CIA station chief in Moscow.
See what she knows about the abduction.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.381
So much for doing nothing
about Reddington's case.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.924
[Cooper] He wants us to get Stepanov.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.634
If we can, the last thing he wants

07:48.718 --> 07:51.220
is for us to interrogate him
about their relationship.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.514
Which is exactly what we're gonna do.

07:56.601 --> 07:59.312
[suspenseful music playing]

08:10.531 --> 08:13.493
Miss Laghari, I'm terribly sorry.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.328
-You're a busy man.
-I am.

08:15.411 --> 08:19.790
And I'm afraid something has come up.
It's unavoidable.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.334
Is this what it's like?

08:21.417 --> 08:24.212
-Come again?
-Working for you.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.964
You come, you go, you summon, I wait?

08:27.840 --> 08:29.258
Is this what it's like?

08:30.384 --> 08:31.761
As I explained--

08:31.844 --> 08:35.973
Seems neglectful, don't you think?
Especially on our first date.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.975
I told Miss Laghari that five minutes--

08:38.059 --> 08:40.311
Yes. That's how long you said I had.

08:40.394 --> 08:43.356
I won't need that long
to tell this won't work,

08:43.439 --> 08:46.234
-if this is how it works.
-Is that right?

08:46.817 --> 08:48.444
You find me, you summon me,

08:48.528 --> 08:50.905
you have your people escort me
through secret tunnels

08:50.988 --> 08:54.033
to get to wherever it is that we are,
then you send me away?

08:55.159 --> 08:56.744
Feels discourteous.

08:59.247 --> 09:03.334
Miss Laghari, I want you to work for me.

09:03.417 --> 09:06.921
I want to pay you
an absurd amount of money to work for me.

09:07.004 --> 09:11.467
With that money comes the understanding
that we work on my schedule

09:11.551 --> 09:13.135
and not yours.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.681
If that's acceptable,
you're enormously rich as of now.

09:16.764 --> 09:20.810
If that offer
somehow feels discourteous...

09:22.436 --> 09:23.563
you see the door.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.567
So...

09:30.278 --> 09:31.571
how rich am I?

09:35.157 --> 09:36.701

09:43.916 --> 09:48.796
I'm all yours.
Just let me know when you need me.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.223
-You have Stepanov.
-Elizabeth.

09:59.307 --> 10:02.435
You were spying on me so you could
grab him and, what, bring him here?

10:02.518 --> 10:04.770
I'm not sure what you're referring to.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.023
Agent Ressler's phone.

10:07.106 --> 10:10.067
The malware. He found it.
You've been recording me.

10:10.151 --> 10:13.112
Yes. The calls you made to the FBI
behind my back.

10:13.195 --> 10:15.615
A lot of people, including VanDyke here,

10:15.698 --> 10:17.867
thought I should have put a bullet
in your head.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.869
-We had an agreement.
-[monitor clicks]

10:19.952 --> 10:22.246
[ominous music playing]

10:24.915 --> 10:26.208
It's really him.

10:27.501 --> 10:28.919
I'll be seeing him soon.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.464
Perhaps you'd like to join,

10:31.547 --> 10:33.841
find out what he knows
about Reddington and N-13.

10:34.717 --> 10:39.180
In the meantime,
no more phone calls to the FBI.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.357
[Raymond] <i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>say that again, Priya.</i>

10:49.440 --> 10:51.609
I said I wasn't able
to fulfill the contract.

10:51.692 --> 10:52.735
He's still alive.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.403
The other part. About the woman.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.031
She stormed in.
Knocked the poison right out of his hand.

10:57.114 --> 11:01.494
She was angry about a man.
Someone he'd abducted. Stepanov.

11:01.577 --> 11:03.913
-She said that name? Stepanov.
<i>-Yes.</i>

11:03.996 --> 11:05.289
-Did you see him?
<i>-No.</i>

11:05.373 --> 11:08.209
But you were inside Townsend's office,
they took you there?

11:08.292 --> 11:11.462
I was. I don't know what floor,
but I'm looking at the building now.

11:11.545 --> 11:15.049
Priya, as soon as we hang up,
text that address to Dembe.

11:15.132 --> 11:18.177
You heard what I said, right? I failed.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.720
Townsend's not dead.

11:19.804 --> 11:20.638
Forget Townsend.

11:20.721 --> 11:23.933
Right now, all I need you to worry about
is getting us that address.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.185
-Yeah. But I thought--
<i>-The address.</i>

11:26.268 --> 11:29.146
Keep an eye on that building
until I call you.

I can't be sure, but Townsend has him
and Elizabeth is there.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.446
It's on Park Avenue.
You want me to assemble a team?

11:37.530 --> 11:40.574
We can't conduct a raid of that size
on Park Avenue.

11:41.700 --> 11:42.660
But Harold can.

11:42.743 --> 11:46.831
If they do, and Stepanov is there,
they'll take him into custody.

11:46.914 --> 11:50.668
The risk is well worth the reward
of getting Ivan away from Townsend.

11:50.751 --> 11:53.295
Unfortunately,
getting Harold to act quickly

11:53.379 --> 11:56.841
requires reading him in on certain facts
I'd hoped to navigate around.

11:59.510 --> 12:02.430

we've gotten nowhere.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.432

your help finding this asset.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.700
The truth is, Ivan Stepanov...

12:23.826 --> 12:27.496
is more than just a Russian
intelligence officer.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.458
Despite what he does, despite what I do...

12:32.418 --> 12:35.671
he's one of my oldest and closest friends.

12:37.006 --> 12:41.427

he is in terrible danger,

12:41.510 --> 12:46.807
and I need your help trying to save him.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.977
What kind of danger?

12:50.060 --> 12:54.231
I believe that Townsend has him
at a facility in Manhattan.

12:54.315 --> 12:57.943
And if that's the case,
he'd be well into an interrogation

12:58.027 --> 13:01.489
that could put me and Elizabeth and anyone

13:01.572 --> 13:05.743

how Townsend found him later.

as we helped Keen locate him.

[Cooper] By my count, it would appear
you're the one causing harm,

keeping secrets from Elizabeth,

13:52.623 --> 13:54.333

save your oldest and closest friend,

24:19.416 --> 24:22.836
[Liz] What's going on?
Why are you looking at me like that?

24:22.919 --> 24:25.672
-What are you gonna do to her?
-[Townsend] Nothing...

24:26.381 --> 24:28.633
compared to what I'm going to do to you.

24:40.353 --> 24:43.106
-[VanDyke] Where you wanna take her?
-No idea, but we need to move her.

24:43.190 --> 24:45.859
If Laghari knows we're here,
Reddington knows.

24:45.942 --> 24:49.237
Take Laghari to see Mr. Peebs.
Have him get her to talk.

24:49.321 --> 24:52.616
-Find out what she knows.
-What about the Russian?

24:52.699 --> 24:55.869

Just make sure nobody finds the body.

Raymond, Elizabeth is here.
Raymond, do you copy?

26:37.595 --> 26:38.680
Yes, Dembe.

26:39.306 --> 26:40.557
Sir, we have to go.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.852
-Sir.
-I'm not leaving him here.

26:55.530 --> 26:57.115
Laghari, there's too many!

26:57.198 --> 26:59.367
Ringo, I need you to plug it up!

27:29.272 --> 27:30.940

-She'll be fine.

Raymond.

28:37.507 --> 28:38.633
You came.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.677
Yes, of course I came.

28:41.344 --> 28:43.346
Now we just gotta get out of here.

28:50.353 --> 28:52.230
[suspenseful music playing]

28:52.313 --> 28:54.190
-What do we know?
-[VanDyke] They took cover.

28:54.274 --> 28:58.069
Barricaded themselves inside the cooler
and jammed the door from the inside.

28:58.153 --> 29:00.405
-[Townsend] We know who's in there?
-Reddington. The Russian.

29:00.488 --> 29:02.782
-Two of his people, maybe more.
-Keen?

29:04.659 --> 29:05.869
Elizabeth?

29:06.786 --> 29:07.871
You in there?

29:08.538 --> 29:10.248
I do hope you're in there.

29:10.331 --> 29:14.127
I need you for this next part,
which promises to be rather awful.

29:14.210 --> 29:18.256
While you have a moment,
I suggest that you and Raymond

29:18.339 --> 29:22.010
reflect upon the concept of loss.

29:22.093 --> 29:23.762
I know it well.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.847
I feel it in every breath I take.

29:26.514 --> 29:29.392
Every moment that [chuckles] I sleep.

29:29.476 --> 29:31.936
Loss became a part of me

29:32.020 --> 29:37.358
when I watched my wife and children die
before my very eyes.

29:39.903 --> 29:43.531
But today, Raymond,
I'm gonna give you that burden.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.992
I'm gonna show you loss.

29:46.075 --> 29:51.247
Today, I'm going to kill Elizabeth
while you watch.

29:55.126 --> 29:57.378
I don't care what you do
to get them out of there,

29:57.462 --> 30:00.089
just make sure
Reddington and Keen are alive.

30:00.173 --> 30:03.927
We got a problem. That was Magnus.
Feds raided Park Avenue.

30:04.010 --> 30:05.929
They found the penthouse and proxy office.

30:06.012 --> 30:08.306
-[Townsend] How long ago?
-Don't know, but we should assume--

30:08.389 --> 30:10.266
No, no, no. Never assume.

30:10.350 --> 30:14.395
The fact is, it won't take long
for them to find us here.

30:14.479 --> 30:19.567
So your timeline has moved up.
But I still want them both alive.

30:21.861 --> 30:23.530
What did you tell him?

30:25.406 --> 30:28.993
What could you possibly say
to suddenly make me his enemy?

30:30.787 --> 30:33.039
-Let him rest.
-What did you say?

30:34.332 --> 30:37.210
-Masha...
-Don't call me that.

[Liz] I know who you are, Ivan.

30:41.506 --> 30:43.967
You're my grandfather's protégé.

30:44.050 --> 30:47.053
My mother's and Reddington's friend.

30:47.136 --> 30:48.638
He needs to rest.

30:48.721 --> 30:51.307
Is this really what she would've wanted?

30:52.183 --> 30:56.563
Your mother only ever wanted
to keep you safe.

30:59.607 --> 31:01.025
He's bleeding.

31:03.152 --> 31:04.487
It's from the abdomen.

31:08.658 --> 31:10.618
I can't feel an exit wound.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.203
He needs a doctor now.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.621
Hold this.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.957
Ivan, hold this tight.

-Go where? We're surrounded.

[Dembe] I need a cube at Kings County.
No, not for Raymond. For an associate.

32:05.673 --> 32:08.217
-We need an escort.
-[Dembe] And an escort. Heavy arms.

32:08.301 --> 32:09.886
[Raymond] Chuck,
what do we have for weapons?

32:09.969 --> 32:13.139
Have my M4, Dembe's SIG,
your Glock, your Browning.

32:13.222 --> 32:14.641
I have two flash bangs.

32:14.724 --> 32:17.936
This, some sort of electric shock collar.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.771
Is that your armored truck?

32:19.854 --> 32:21.648
Ringo's in place, standing by.

32:24.108 --> 32:25.610
What do you have in mind?

32:26.611 --> 32:28.112
I have a couple of ideas.

32:32.367 --> 32:33.576
[Raymond] Chuck, your knife.

before they come down that vent.

-[Dembe] What do we have?
-[Chuck] Whatever's left in the Browning.

32:43.419 --> 32:47.131
Two magazines for the pistols.
My M4's got about a half a mag.

I can help you.

Okay, ready.

34:31.986 --> 34:36.074
Raymond, I'd like you and Elizabeth
to step out of the vehicle.

34:36.741 --> 34:39.077
-Do not go out there.
-I have the second flash bang.

34:39.160 --> 34:41.412
I can detonate it
and give Dembe a chance to get--

34:41.496 --> 34:43.247
-Elizabeth--
-He won't hurt me

34:43.331 --> 34:44.624
if you can't see it.

We lost Townsend and Keen?

35:51.315 --> 35:53.985
And Stepanov.

to see if he can track them.

[Ressler] Wherever Townsend
and Keen went, it wasn't together.

I lost an SUV
headed through the Lincoln Tunnel.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.078
That was Townsend.

and went south. Keen was on foot.

into Brooklyn over the Manhattan Bridge

Not many would.

Tired but stable.

I'm told the feds got nothing
but shredded paper.

41:34.283 --> 41:37.077
And about 36 million in precious gems.

41:38.621 --> 41:40.122
Issue a new directive

41:40.206 --> 41:44.335
for Elizabeth Keen, Donald Ressler
and her whole FBI crew.

41:44.418 --> 41:45.794
Laghari too.

41:48.214 --> 41:49.423
[Raymond] Forget Stepanov.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.134
He's a distraction.

41:53.052 --> 41:54.553
Focus on Townsend.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.265

includes you, Harold.

42:05.773 --> 42:07.775
We're all in his crosshairs now.

42:08.776 --> 42:11.862
And the only way out is to work together.

42:11.946 --> 42:13.864
I'm willing to do that. Are you?
