04:30.476 --> 04:32.876
- Here we go, Nick.
- All right

04:35.776 --> 04:37.746
- Good morning, Detective.
- I want a shot of the two detectives.

04:37.776 --> 04:39.836
Keep it back, folks.

04:39.916 --> 04:41.846
- Howdy.
- Morning.

04:44.355 --> 04:46.415
Up there.

04:50.595 --> 04:52.855
- How's it going, Gus?
- Morning, Pete.

04:52.925 --> 04:57.325
- Who was this fucking guy?
- Rock and roll, Gus. Johnny Boz.

04:57.395 --> 04:59.525
- Never heard of him.
- Before your time, cowboy.

04:59.595 --> 05:01.935
- Hey, Ronny, where they hiding?
- Upstairs, to the right.

05:02.065 --> 05:05.564
Mid '60s, had five or six hits.
Got a club down on Fillmore now.

05:05.774 --> 05:07.294
Not now, he don't.

05:08.774 --> 05:10.904
Do we have a time
of death? Almost.

05:11.074 --> 05:13.444
- Do you guys know Captain Tallcott?
- Sure.

05:13.484 --> 05:16.774
- What's the Chief's office doing here?
- Observing.

05:18.814 --> 05:22.774
- What's it say, Doc? - Ninety-two
degrees. About six hours.

05:22.854 --> 05:25.414
Puts time of death
at around 2:00 a. m.

05:25.494 --> 05:28.823
Can somebody close
the drapes over there?

05:28.893 --> 05:31.523
Maid came in about an hour
ago and found the body.

05:31.563 --> 05:33.933
- She's not a live-in.
- Maybe the maid did it.

05:34.103 --> 05:36.533
She's 54 years old
and weighs 240 pounds.

05:36.573 --> 05:39.063
- No bruises on the body.
- It ain't the maid.

05:39.303 --> 05:40.533
Never know.

05:44.413 --> 05:45.813
Sorry.

05:45.843 --> 05:49.403
He was last seen leaving the club
with his girlfriend about midnight.

05:49.483 --> 05:53.312
- What was it?
- Ice pick. Left it in the living room.

05:55.622 --> 05:58.852
There's come stains
all over the sheets.

06:06.432 --> 06:09.892
- Very impressive.
- He got off before he got off.

06:10.102 --> 06:12.032
Gentlemen, this is sensitive.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.801
Mr. Boz was a major contributor
to the mayor's campaign.

06:14.871 --> 06:17.361
He was chairman of the board
of the Palace of Fine Arts.

06:17.441 --> 06:19.411
I thought he was a
rock and roll star.

06:19.441 --> 06:21.501
He was a retired
rock and roll star.

06:21.581 --> 06:24.841
A civic-minded, very
respectable rock and roll star.

06:24.911 --> 06:27.441
Then, what's that over there?

06:29.581 --> 06:32.851
Looks like civic-minded,
very respectable cocaine.

06:35.361 --> 06:38.290
Listen to me, Curran. I'm
gonna get a lot of heat on this.

06:38.330 --> 06:40.290
I don't want any mistakes.

06:45.870 --> 06:47.700
What's Boz's girl
friend's name?

06:49.370 --> 06:52.860
"Catherine Tramell,
162 Divisadero."

06:59.610 --> 07:02.579
- Always a pleasure, Captain.
- He's up bright and early.

07:02.649 --> 07:05.709
He doesn't usually punch
in 'til after his 18 holes.

07:05.919 --> 07:08.289
Johnny and the mayor
must have been very tight.

07:08.359 --> 07:10.694
Nick, keep your 3:00.

07:10.729 --> 07:12.589
You want me to
work the case...

07:12.629 --> 07:14.419
- I said, keep it!
- All right.

07:14.499 --> 07:16.289
I'll keep it.

07:49.627 --> 07:51.687
Good morning. I'm Detective
Curran. This is Detective Moran.

07:51.727 --> 07:56.397
San Francisco Police Department. I'd
like to speak to Catherine Tramell.

07:57.767 --> 07:59.667
Come in.

08:05.347 --> 08:07.747
Sit, please. Just a moment.

08:14.316 --> 08:17.346
Ain't that cute? They got
his and hers Picasso's.

08:17.426 --> 08:20.716
- I didn't know you knew a Picasso.
- Sure I do. It says right here.

08:20.756 --> 08:22.746
Hers is bigger.

08:33.575 --> 08:36.635
Sorry to bother you. We just
got a couple of questions.

08:36.674 --> 08:39.434
- Are you vice?
- No, we're homicide.

08:39.475 --> 08:41.275
What do you want?

08:41.345 --> 08:43.815
When was the last
time you saw John Boz?

08:45.385 --> 08:46.645
Is he dead?

08:47.785 --> 08:49.755
Why do you think he's dead?

08:49.785 --> 08:52.485
Well, you wouldn't be
here otherwise, would you?

08:52.555 --> 08:54.715
Were you with him last night?

08:56.624 --> 08:59.324
You're looking for
Catherine, not me.

09:01.434 --> 09:03.594
- Who are you?
- I'm Roxy.

09:05.564 --> 09:07.664
I'm her friend.

09:11.574 --> 09:14.474
Well, Roxy, do you know
where your friend is?

09:16.074 --> 09:20.773
She's out at the beach house
at Stenson. Seadrift 1402.

09:21.083 --> 09:22.343
Thanks.

09:25.383 --> 09:27.353
You're wasting your time.

09:29.293 --> 09:32.353
Catherine didn't kill him.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.590
Miss Tramell?

11:06.749 --> 11:09.519
Good afternoon. I'm Detective
Curran. This is Detective Moran.

11:09.549 --> 11:11.749
- We're with the San Francisco Police...
- I know who you are.

11:14.459 --> 11:15.818
So, how did he die?

11:16.288 --> 11:17.388
He was murdered.

11:17.428 --> 11:18.828
Obviously.

11:19.298 --> 11:22.458
- How was he murdered?
- With an ice pick.

11:26.838 --> 11:28.808
How long were you dating him?

11:30.338 --> 11:32.828
I wasn't dating him.
I was fucking him.

11:35.678 --> 11:36.738
What are you, a pro?

11:38.377 --> 11:39.607
No, I'm an amateur.

11:41.347 --> 11:42.877
How long were you
having sex with him?

11:43.317 --> 11:44.787
About a year and a half.

11:44.857 --> 11:47.417
- Were you with him last night?
- Yes.

11:47.457 --> 11:48.617
Did you leave
the club with him?

11:48.687 --> 11:51.287
- Yes.
- Did you go home with him?

11:51.357 --> 11:55.297
No. We had a drink at the
club. We left together.

11:55.367 --> 11:57.297
He went home, and
I came out here.

11:57.367 --> 11:59.497
Was there anyone
with you last night?

11:59.537 --> 12:02.796
No. I wasn't in
the mood last night.

12:10.876 --> 12:14.576
Let me ask you
something, Miss Tramell.

12:14.616 --> 12:16.776
Are you sorry he's dead?

12:16.856 --> 12:18.816
Yeah.

12:19.316 --> 12:21.416
I liked fucking him.

12:26.725 --> 12:28.855
Look, I don't really
feel like talking anymore.

12:30.395 --> 12:33.335
Listen, lady, we can do
this downtown, if you want.

12:33.395 --> 12:35.425
So read me my rights
and arrest me...

12:35.505 --> 12:37.665
and then I'll go downtown.

12:42.575 --> 12:45.475
Otherwise, get the
fuck out of here.

12:52.584 --> 12:54.574
Please.

13:17.773 --> 13:20.003
Nice girl.

13:35.822 --> 13:39.062
I'm sorry, Beth. I
got hung up in Stenson.

13:41.502 --> 13:44.762
- How are you, Nick?
- I'm fine.

13:44.832 --> 13:47.772
Come on, Beth. You know I'm fine. How
long do we have to keep doing this?

13:47.842 --> 13:50.832
As long as Internal Affairs
wants you to, I suppose.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.862
- Have a seat.
- It's bullshit. You know it is.

13:53.072 --> 13:58.031
I know it is. But sit down, anyway,
so we can get it over with, okay?

14:05.491 --> 14:08.751
So, how are things?

14:08.791 --> 14:11.756
Things are fine.

14:11.791 --> 14:14.661
I told you, all
right? Things are fine.

14:14.731 --> 14:16.631
How is your personal life?

14:16.661 --> 14:18.661
My sex life is fine.

14:20.740 --> 14:24.670
My sex life is actually pretty
shitty since I stopped seeing you.

14:28.480 --> 14:30.540
I started developing calluses.

14:34.880 --> 14:37.550
Sorry.

14:38.620 --> 14:39.880
How's the booze?

14:40.050 --> 14:42.520
Haven't had a drink
in three months.

14:42.560 --> 14:45.689
- What about the coke?
- No.

14:45.759 --> 14:49.859
No. I'm working my ass
off. I'm off the sauce.

14:50.029 --> 14:52.019
I even stopped smoking.

14:53.499 --> 14:54.729
How is not smoking?

14:54.799 --> 14:56.789
It sucks.

14:58.709 --> 15:00.869
Now, will you tell I.A.
I'm just your average...

15:01.079 --> 15:03.824
healthy, totally
fucked up cop...

15:03.859 --> 15:06.568
and let me out
of here, please?

15:12.818 --> 15:15.248
Yes.

15:15.288 --> 15:17.278
Thank you.

15:26.528 --> 15:28.058
I still miss you, Nick.

15:36.837 --> 15:38.807
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

15:40.577 --> 15:42.847
Tallcott's in there. They're
waiting. How did it go?

15:43.017 --> 15:44.747
She misses me.

15:44.817 --> 15:47.787
Boy, when that girl
mates, it's for life.

15:47.817 --> 15:50.047
All right, let's
start. Harrigan.

15:50.287 --> 15:52.557
Well, we got 31 stab
wounds, neck and the chest.

15:52.587 --> 15:55.286
No usable prints, no forceable
entry, nothing missing.

15:55.326 --> 15:58.816
No prints on the ice pick, either.
You can pick it up at any K-Mart.

15:58.896 --> 16:01.866
The scarf was Hermes.
It's expensive.

16:02.036 --> 16:05.026
They sell about 20,000
a year, worldwide.

16:05.266 --> 16:09.066
Bottle was cocaine. High quality,
high content. He inhaled it.

16:09.306 --> 16:12.296
There were minute quantities
on his lips and penis.

16:12.376 --> 16:14.306
Mr. Boz leaves $5 million.

16:14.376 --> 16:17.345
No direct survivors.
No criminal record.

16:17.585 --> 16:20.675
He liked his drugs. He liked his
girls. He liked his rock and roll.

16:20.715 --> 16:22.375
He liked the mayor too, right?

16:27.855 --> 16:29.845
What about his girlfriend?

16:30.025 --> 16:33.055
- Is she relevant here? Is she a suspect?
- She's a suspect.

16:33.295 --> 16:34.665
On what basis?

16:34.695 --> 16:37.825
"Girlfriend: Catherine Tramell.
Age 30. No priors. No convictions.

16:37.865 --> 16:40.394
Magna cum laude
at Berkeley, 1983.

16:40.604 --> 16:43.074
Double major: Literature
and psychology.

16:43.274 --> 16:45.704
Daughter, sole survivor,
Marvin and Elaine Tramell...

16:45.744 --> 16:48.304
killed in a boating
accident, 1979.

16:48.374 --> 16:52.714
Catherine Tramell, sole heir.
Estimated assets: $ 110 million."

16:52.744 --> 16:54.719
You're shitting me.

16:54.754 --> 16:57.584
"Formerly engaged to
Manuel Vasquez, deceased."

16:57.624 --> 17:00.244
Whoa, whoa! Manny Vasquez?

17:00.324 --> 17:03.693
Former middleweight contender. Killed
in the ring, Atlantic City, 1984.

17:03.763 --> 17:05.992
I love it. She's got
100 million bucks.

17:06.022 --> 17:08.252
She fucks fighters and
rock and roll stars...

17:08.333 --> 17:10.393
and she's got a degree in
screwing with people's heads.

17:10.603 --> 17:13.433
You forgot about her degree
in literature. She's a writer.

17:13.603 --> 17:17.633
She published a novel under a pen
name. Want to know what it's about?

17:17.703 --> 17:22.643
It's about a retired rock and roll star
who gets murdered by his girlfriend.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.692
Page 67, cowboy.

17:37.762 --> 17:40.282
You know how she
does the boyfriend?

17:40.322 --> 17:43.822
With an ice pick, in bed...

17:43.902 --> 17:47.422
his hands tied with
a white silk scarf.

17:52.041 --> 17:53.871
Dr. Garner.

17:55.371 --> 17:59.241
I've asked Dr. Lamont to consult
with us. This isn't really my turf.

17:59.311 --> 18:02.441
Dr. Lamont teaches the pathology of
psychopathic behavior at Stanford...

18:02.611 --> 18:06.281
and also on the Justice Department
Psychological Profile Team.

18:06.351 --> 18:08.321
Dr. Lamont.

18:10.021 --> 18:12.250
I see two possibilities.

18:12.320 --> 18:16.260
One: The person who wrote
this book is your murderer...

18:16.330 --> 18:20.460
and acted out the killing described
in ritualistic, literal detail.

18:20.670 --> 18:23.690
Two: Someone who wants
to harm the writer...

18:23.770 --> 18:27.400
read the book and enacted the
killing described to incriminate her.

18:27.470 --> 18:30.240
What if the writer did it?
Then what are we dealing with?

18:30.310 --> 18:33.640
You're dealing with a
devious, diabolical mind.

18:33.710 --> 18:37.309
You see, this book had to have
been written at least six months...

18:37.379 --> 18:40.279
maybe even years...
before it was published...

18:40.319 --> 18:43.849
which means the writer must have planned
the crime in the subconscious back then.

18:43.919 --> 18:46.319
Now, the fact that
she carried it out...

18:46.389 --> 18:48.449
indicates psychopathic
obsessive behavior...

18:48.529 --> 18:50.494
in terms not only of
the killing itself...

18:50.529 --> 18:54.399
but also in terms of the applied
advance defense mechanism.

18:55.799 --> 18:59.428
Sometimes I can't tell
shit from shinola, Doc.

18:59.498 --> 19:01.028
What was all that
you just said?

19:01.238 --> 19:03.538
- She intended the book to be her alibi.
- Correct.

19:03.738 --> 19:06.438
She's going to say, "Do you think
I'd be dumb enough to kill anyone...

19:06.478 --> 19:08.778
in the exact way I
described in my book?"

19:08.808 --> 19:11.248
I wouldn't do that because
I know I'd be the suspect.

19:11.278 --> 19:14.878
So, what if it's not the writer? What
if it's someone who read the book?

19:16.518 --> 19:19.488
You're dealing, then,
with someone so obsessed...

19:19.518 --> 19:23.787
that he or she is willing to kill
an irrelevant and innocent victim...

19:23.857 --> 19:27.057
in order to place the blame on
the person who wrote that book.

19:27.267 --> 19:30.827
I'm talking about a deep-seated
obsessional hatred...

19:30.867 --> 19:33.797
and an utter lack of
respect for human life.

19:40.237 --> 19:44.736
So, we got a once in a lifetime,
top of the line looney-tuney.

19:44.776 --> 19:46.876
That's what you're
saying, right, Doc?

19:48.446 --> 19:51.816
You're dealing with
someone very dangerous...

19:51.886 --> 19:54.546
and very ill.

19:58.856 --> 20:02.586
You know there's no case here.
You've got no physical evidence.

20:02.796 --> 20:05.386
She hasn't got an alibi.

20:05.466 --> 20:08.395
She hasn't got a motive,
either. Believe me...

20:08.465 --> 20:11.405
her defense would just beat us
to death with this copycat thing.

20:11.440 --> 20:14.775
Anybody who read the
book could have done it.

20:14.805 --> 20:19.265
- What do you want to do now? Nothing?
- We call her in for questioning.

20:19.315 --> 20:21.305
She's got enough money to
burn the department down...

20:21.345 --> 20:24.545
She was the last person
seen with the guy.

20:24.585 --> 20:27.385
I'll take the responsibility.

20:27.455 --> 20:29.425
It's yours.

20:31.594 --> 20:33.254
It won't do any good.

20:33.324 --> 20:35.414
She'll just waltz in with
some superstar lawyer...

20:35.494 --> 20:38.394
who'll get us all canned for
wasting the taxpayers' money.

20:38.429 --> 20:40.834
- That's exactly what she'll do.
- No, she won't.

20:43.264 --> 20:46.364
I don't think she'll
hide behind anybody.

20:46.404 --> 20:48.494
I don't think she's
gonna hide at all.

20:48.574 --> 20:51.504
Then she's as crazy
as you are, Curran.

20:56.443 --> 20:58.503
You know what they say:

20:58.583 --> 21:01.313
Takes one to know one.

21:25.912 --> 21:29.642
Miss Tramell, we'd like you to come
downtown to answer a few questions.

21:29.842 --> 21:31.812
Are you arresting me?

21:32.852 --> 21:34.872
If that's the way
you want to play it.

21:34.952 --> 21:38.352
Could I change into
something more appropriate?

21:38.422 --> 21:40.681
It'll only take a
minute. Come on in.

21:44.591 --> 21:47.861
Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll be right back.

22:05.380 --> 22:06.640
Hey, Gus. Hmm?

22:06.680 --> 22:10.640
- So, how long is this gonna take?
- I don't know.

22:15.620 --> 22:18.320
Do you always keep
old newspapers around?

22:18.360 --> 22:21.330
Only when they make
interesting reading.

22:36.479 --> 22:39.569
- I'm ready.
- You have the right to an attorney.

22:39.649 --> 22:42.309
Why would I need an attorney?

22:52.528 --> 22:55.388
- Do you have a cigarette?
- I don't smoke.

22:55.428 --> 22:57.398
Yes, you do.

22:59.468 --> 23:01.898
- I quit.
- Congratulations.

23:13.947 --> 23:16.277
I thought you didn't
have any cigarettes.

23:16.347 --> 23:18.747
Oh, I found some in my
pocket. Would you like one?

23:21.787 --> 23:24.277
I told you, I quit.

23:24.357 --> 23:26.517
It won't last.

23:31.467 --> 23:34.727
- You working on another book?
- Yes, I am.

23:34.767 --> 23:38.566
It must really be something
making stuff up all the time.

23:38.606 --> 23:41.336
Yeah, it teaches you to lie.

23:42.676 --> 23:44.336
How's that?

23:45.376 --> 23:49.316
You make up believable stuff. It's
called suspension of disbelief.

23:50.346 --> 23:52.676
I like that!
Suspension of disbelief.

23:55.486 --> 23:57.476
What's your new book about?

24:00.385 --> 24:03.355
A detective. He falls
for the wrong woman.

24:09.335 --> 24:10.555
What happens?

24:10.595 --> 24:12.725
She kills him.

24:24.714 --> 24:27.514
I'm John Carreli, Miss Tramell,
assistant district attorney.

24:27.554 --> 24:29.574
I have to inform you this
session's being taped.

24:29.654 --> 24:32.514
- This is Captain Tallcott.
- My pleasure.

24:32.584 --> 24:34.614
- And Lieutenant Walker.
- Hi.

24:34.694 --> 24:37.354
- Can we get you a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.

24:37.424 --> 24:39.394
Are your attorneys
going to join us?

24:39.424 --> 24:41.554
Miss Tramell has waived
her rights to an attorney.

24:45.663 --> 24:47.603
Did I miss something?

24:47.673 --> 24:49.603
I told them you wouldn't
want an attorney present.

24:50.633 --> 24:53.543
Why have you waived your right
to an attorney, Miss Tramell?

24:53.573 --> 24:55.543
Why did you think
I wouldn't want one?

24:55.573 --> 24:57.733
I told them you
wouldn't want to hide.

24:57.783 --> 25:00.513
I have nothing to hide.

25:14.262 --> 25:16.622
There's no smoking
in this building.

25:18.462 --> 25:20.732
What are you gonna do?
Charge me with smoking?

25:34.411 --> 25:37.511
Would you tell us the nature of
your relationship with Mr. Boz?

25:37.581 --> 25:40.521
I had sex with him for
about a year and a half.

25:41.791 --> 25:44.781
I liked having sex with him.

25:44.821 --> 25:48.451
He wasn't afraid
of experimenting.

25:48.531 --> 25:51.551
I like men like that.

25:51.601 --> 25:53.721
Men who give me pleasure.

25:54.830 --> 25:57.800
He gave me a lot of pleasure.

26:01.810 --> 26:07.470
You ever engage in any
sadomasochistic activity?

26:09.310 --> 26:12.280
Exactly what did you
have in mind, Mr. Carreli?

26:14.790 --> 26:16.720
- You ever tie him up?
- No.

26:16.750 --> 26:18.379
You never tied him up?

26:18.459 --> 26:20.419
No.

26:20.459 --> 26:23.359
Johnny liked to use
his hands too much.

26:23.429 --> 26:26.399
I like hands and fingers.

26:27.599 --> 26:30.659
You describe a white
silk scarf in your book.

26:30.699 --> 26:33.469
I've always had a fondness
for white silk scarves.

26:33.539 --> 26:35.509
They're good for
all occasions.

26:35.539 --> 26:39.309
But you said you liked men to
use their hands, didn't you?

26:39.339 --> 26:41.708
No, I said I liked
Johnny to use his hands.

26:43.808 --> 26:47.768
I don't make any rules,
Nick. I go with the flow.

26:49.818 --> 26:51.748
Did you kill Mr.
Boz, Miss Tramell?

26:51.818 --> 26:54.788
I'd have to be pretty stupid
to write a book about killing...

26:54.858 --> 26:57.828
and then kill somebody the
way I described it in my book.

26:57.858 --> 27:01.758
I'd be announcing myself as
the killer. I'm not stupid.

27:01.798 --> 27:03.727
We know you're not stupid.

27:03.767 --> 27:05.697
Maybe that's what you're counting
on to get you off the hook.

27:05.737 --> 27:07.527
Writing the book
gives you an alibi.

27:07.607 --> 27:09.327
Yes, it does.

27:12.477 --> 27:15.707
The answer's no.
I didn't kill him.

27:18.317 --> 27:21.547
- Do you use drugs, Miss Tramell?
- Sometimes.

27:21.617 --> 27:24.547
- Did you ever use drugs with Mr. Boz?
- Sure.

27:24.617 --> 27:25.747
What kind of drugs?

27:25.787 --> 27:27.976
Cocaine.

27:28.356 --> 27:30.326
Have you ever fucked
on cocaine, Nick?

27:45.436 --> 27:47.376
It's nice.

27:57.755 --> 27:59.745
You like playing
games, don't you?

27:59.815 --> 28:02.755
I have a degree in psychology.
It goes with the turf.

28:02.925 --> 28:04.655
Games are fun.

28:04.695 --> 28:08.425
What about boxing? That's
a game. Is that fun too?

28:08.495 --> 28:11.585
I don't think that's
relevant to this inquiry.

28:11.635 --> 28:14.034
Boxing was fun
'til Manny died.

28:15.634 --> 28:16.994
How did you feel when he died?

28:17.034 --> 28:18.624
I loved him. It hurt.

28:18.704 --> 28:21.004
How did you feel when I
told you Johnny Boz had died?

28:22.604 --> 28:24.974
I felt like someone had read
my book and was playing a game.

28:25.014 --> 28:26.534
- But it didn't hurt?
- No.

28:26.614 --> 28:27.974
- Because you didn't love him?
- That's right.

28:28.014 --> 28:29.534
Even though you
were fucking him?

28:29.614 --> 28:31.544
You still get the pleasure.

28:31.614 --> 28:34.484
Didn't you ever fuck anybody
else when you were married, Nick?

28:34.524 --> 28:36.013
How'd you know he was married?

28:36.223 --> 28:38.513
Maybe I was just guessing.

28:38.593 --> 28:40.753
What difference does it make?

28:44.493 --> 28:46.653
Would you like a
cigarette, Nick?

28:54.543 --> 28:57.503
- Do you two know each other?
- No.

29:01.212 --> 29:02.642
How did you meet Mr. Boz?

29:02.712 --> 29:06.202
I wanted to write a book about the
murder of a retired rock and roll star.

29:06.382 --> 29:09.652
I went down to his club, I picked
him up and I had sex with him.

29:11.752 --> 29:14.982
You didn't feel anything for him? You
just had sex with him for your book?

29:15.222 --> 29:19.682
In the beginning. Then I got
to like what he did for me.

29:20.732 --> 29:22.701
That's pretty cold,
ain't it, lady?

29:22.761 --> 29:25.491
I'm a writer. I use
people for what I write.

29:25.531 --> 29:28.631
Let the world beware.

29:31.001 --> 29:32.941
Do you want me to take
a lie detector test?

29:42.551 --> 29:44.521
Wait here, please.

29:51.530 --> 29:54.490
No blips, no blood pressure
variations, no pulse variance.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.660
Either she's telling the truth,
or I've never seen anyone like her.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.770
I guess that settles it.

30:05.210 --> 30:08.200
- She's lying.
- Forget it. You can't fool the machine.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.639
Trust me. It can be done.

30:09.709 --> 30:11.539
And what makes
you such an expert?

30:12.749 --> 30:15.269
Because I know people
that have done it.

30:19.689 --> 30:21.209
Thank you.

30:21.289 --> 30:24.259
Thanks for coming in, Miss
Tramell. Sorry to inconvenience you.

30:24.289 --> 30:26.779
Could someone give
me a ride home?

30:26.859 --> 30:28.829
Sure.

30:30.029 --> 30:31.858
Thank you.

30:36.498 --> 30:38.988
Want to get a drink?

30:48.678 --> 30:51.648
- Rough day?
- Not really.

30:51.688 --> 30:54.208
Beating that machine
can't be easy.

30:55.787 --> 30:59.747
If I was guilty and wanted to beat
that machine, it wouldn't be hard.

31:01.597 --> 31:03.687
It wouldn't be hard at all.

31:05.827 --> 31:10.287
You took a lie detector test after
you shot those two people, didn't you?

31:12.767 --> 31:13.997
I passed.

31:15.637 --> 31:18.836
You see? We're
both innocent, Nick.

31:36.826 --> 31:40.356
You seem to know an
awful lot about me.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.865
You know an awful
lot about me.

31:44.605 --> 31:47.195
I don't know anything
that's not police business.

31:50.275 --> 31:53.835
You know I don't wear any
underwear. Don't you, Nick?

32:02.655 --> 32:05.214
Thanks for the ride.

32:18.764 --> 32:21.324
Would you like
another glass of wine?

32:22.734 --> 32:24.834
- Hi, Nick.
- Evening.

32:27.203 --> 32:28.573
What's all this "Nick" stuff?

32:28.613 --> 32:31.233
"Nick, do you want a cigarette?
Nick, can I have a ride?"

32:31.313 --> 32:33.873
She didn't ask me to give
her a ride. She asked anybody.

32:34.213 --> 32:36.613
- And you volunteered.
- Hey, Nick. Evian?

32:36.683 --> 32:40.013
No, Chuckie. Get me a double
blackjack on the rocks, please.

32:41.823 --> 32:43.793
What you doing, Hoss?

32:45.263 --> 32:47.783
I haven't had a
drink in three months.

32:47.863 --> 32:51.292
All right with you, cowboy?

32:51.332 --> 32:54.322
- She doesn't know me, okay?
- Here you go.

32:54.362 --> 32:57.362
I never seen her before
Gus and I talked with her.

32:57.432 --> 32:59.372
- Thanks, Chuck.
- You're sure?

32:59.442 --> 33:01.432
Yes, I'm sure.

33:01.642 --> 33:03.402
Cheers.

33:10.782 --> 33:12.272
Now what?

33:12.352 --> 33:14.281
What "now what"? Now nothing.

33:14.321 --> 33:16.291
She passed the
polygraph. That's it.

33:16.351 --> 33:18.381
She knew how to beat it,
that's why she took it.

33:18.461 --> 33:21.651
How in the fuck do you know? What
is it with you and this broad?

33:21.691 --> 33:24.321
Come on, Phil. Don't
let this one slide.

33:24.391 --> 33:26.661
What about her parents? What
about what else she published?

33:26.731 --> 33:28.701
Maybe all her books come true.

33:28.771 --> 33:31.761
Her parents died in an accident. I
don't care what else she published.

33:31.841 --> 33:34.201
What are you, a book critic?

33:34.241 --> 33:37.370
How'd they die? Was
there an investigation?

33:37.410 --> 33:40.710
You're saying she killed her parents?
Did she kill Manny Vasquez too?

33:41.850 --> 33:45.870
Not unless she climbed into the ring
and turned into one mean son of a bitch.

33:47.380 --> 33:49.410
Maybe she did. Maybe she
grew herself an afro...

33:49.490 --> 33:52.280
developed a hell of a left hook and
put shoe polish all over her face.

33:52.320 --> 33:54.760
- Let's polygraph her again.
- Fuck you.

33:54.790 --> 33:56.295
Fuck you too.

33:56.330 --> 33:58.660
Don't worry, Phil.
Nick'll fuck himself.

33:58.700 --> 34:02.499
You guys are very funny. Hey,
Chuckie, get me another double.

34:02.669 --> 34:05.229
Hey, shooter!

34:05.299 --> 34:08.199
Are you back on the
blackjack, shooter?

34:08.268 --> 34:11.728
- We're discussing a case here.
- I know that. I have no doubts.

34:11.809 --> 34:14.708
Here you go, Nick.

34:14.779 --> 34:17.748
A double, huh, shooter?

34:22.449 --> 34:23.818
I'm off duty, Nilsen.

34:26.688 --> 34:29.987
You hear me? I'm off
duty discussing a case.

34:30.228 --> 34:32.697
Now, I.A. Shouldn't
have a problem with that.

34:34.697 --> 34:37.328
Maybe I should put
in for some overtime?

34:39.237 --> 34:43.728
Don't work too hard, shooter.
It might drive you to drink.

34:46.536 --> 34:50.206
Stop riding me, man! I'll
kick your fucking teeth in!

34:50.277 --> 34:53.737
- What's the problem?
- No problem, Doctor.

34:53.777 --> 34:57.847
Here comes the shrink, just in
time to save her favorite patient.

34:57.917 --> 34:59.447
Just fuck off, Marty!

35:01.257 --> 35:03.777
You kids have a good
time tonight, huh?

35:09.466 --> 35:13.396
- He's asking for it.
- That's right, so don't take the bait.

35:16.536 --> 35:18.466
Do you want to go?

35:19.876 --> 35:21.836
- Yes.
- Let's go.

35:25.216 --> 35:28.836
Sometimes I think he started banging
her just to get Internal Affairs off him.

35:28.916 --> 35:33.285
He ain't that way.
He's got a heart.

37:45.380 --> 37:47.440
What was she like?

37:47.480 --> 37:50.240
- Who?
- Catherine Tramell.

37:52.449 --> 37:55.289
You had her pegged. She
used her book as an alibi.

37:58.359 --> 38:00.489
I met her at Berkeley.

38:02.599 --> 38:05.459
We were in some of
the same classes.

38:05.499 --> 38:08.299
Why didn't you tell me?

38:08.369 --> 38:10.339
I'm telling you.

38:19.678 --> 38:23.618
You've never been
like that before. Why?

38:23.648 --> 38:25.618
You tell me.
You're the shrink.

38:28.358 --> 38:31.618
- You weren't making love to me.
- Who was I making love to?

38:31.658 --> 38:34.288
You weren't making love.

38:38.597 --> 38:40.257
I need a cigarette.

38:40.297 --> 38:42.527
I thought you said you quit.

38:48.477 --> 38:51.477
It's the top
drawer in the foyer.

38:51.512 --> 38:54.467
Get it on your way out!

39:04.416 --> 39:07.216
- Have you started?
- Waitin' on you.

39:07.256 --> 39:10.456
- You look like dog shit.
- No, he looks a little shrunk is all.

39:10.526 --> 39:12.756
And not just in the head.

39:13.226 --> 39:15.596
All right, I made a couple
of calls to Berkeley.

39:15.666 --> 39:18.396
There was a murder
in '80. A professor.

39:18.436 --> 39:22.526
In his bed, multiple stab
wounds, with an ice pick.

39:24.475 --> 39:26.705
Tramell was there
then, wasn't she?

39:27.775 --> 39:31.435
University records
say she was.

39:31.475 --> 39:34.315
Okay, let's move on this.
Gus, get out to Berkeley.

39:34.385 --> 39:36.405
Harrigan, find out what
else she's published.

39:36.485 --> 39:38.215
Andrews, get me that file
on the parents' accident.

39:38.285 --> 39:40.775
Copy Beth on everything.
I want psychological input.

39:41.255 --> 39:44.415
- What about me?
- You're already getting input.

39:44.495 --> 39:47.424
You go soak your head
in a tub of ice water.

39:56.274 --> 39:57.734
You see where she leads.

43:22.665 --> 43:24.695
You have a good weekend.

43:24.765 --> 43:26.435
You too.

43:26.505 --> 43:27.805
Drive carefully.

43:27.975 --> 43:30.465
- I will.
- Bye-bye.

43:30.505 --> 43:31.775
I'll call you.

45:53.179 --> 45:56.808
Ain't you got nothing better to do
than to jack off the damn machine?

45:56.978 --> 45:58.708
What are you
doing here, cowboy?

45:58.748 --> 46:01.808
I came in here to jack
off the damn machine.

46:01.948 --> 46:04.548
One dead psychology professor.

46:04.618 --> 46:08.648
Dr. Noah Goldstein.
And guess what?

46:08.728 --> 46:11.598
He was her counselor.

46:11.628 --> 46:12.933
Was she a suspect?

46:12.968 --> 46:15.958
No, sir. They never even
got a statement from her.

46:17.298 --> 46:19.668
Hazel Dobkins?

46:19.738 --> 46:21.597
Do you know her?

46:21.667 --> 46:24.197
Couldn't get it out
of my head for years.

46:24.277 --> 46:26.797
Nice little housewife.
Three little kids.

46:26.847 --> 46:30.647
Nice husband wasn't porking
around. No financial problems.

46:30.717 --> 46:35.547
One day, out of the clear blue
sky, she does them, all of them.

46:35.587 --> 46:38.647
Used a knife she got
for a wedding present.

46:38.727 --> 46:41.987
Didn't even deny
it. Sweet as honey.

46:42.227 --> 46:44.956
Said she didn't know
why she'd done it.

46:57.706 --> 47:00.676
- Hi.
- Am I disturbing you?

47:00.706 --> 47:03.706
No, come on in.

47:04.746 --> 47:06.715
Let's go upstairs.

47:23.735 --> 47:25.825
I'm using you for my
detective in my book.

47:27.165 --> 47:29.194
You don't mind, do you?

47:31.734 --> 47:34.704
I was just gonna
make myself a drink.

47:34.744 --> 47:36.734
- Do you want one?
- No, thanks.

47:36.814 --> 47:40.744
Oh, right. You're off the
Jack Daniels too, aren't you?

47:44.454 --> 47:46.614
I've got a few more
questions to ask you.

47:46.684 --> 47:49.744
I have some for you
too. For my book.

47:59.763 --> 48:02.753
Do you have something
against ice cubes?

48:02.803 --> 48:04.793
I like rough edges.

48:04.833 --> 48:07.833
So, what did you
want to ask me?

48:07.973 --> 48:10.403
How does it feel
to kill someone?

48:13.313 --> 48:14.713
You tell me.

48:16.712 --> 48:19.272
I don't know, but you do.

48:20.822 --> 48:22.752
It was an accident.

48:22.822 --> 48:24.722
They got in the line of fire.

48:28.222 --> 48:31.792
Four shootings in five
years, all accidents?

48:33.662 --> 48:36.662
They were drug buys. I
was working undercover.

48:38.631 --> 48:41.471
You want to tell me
about Professor Goldstein?

48:44.411 --> 48:46.811
Well, there's a
name from the past.

48:46.881 --> 48:50.181
You want a name from the
present? What about Hazel Dobkins?

48:51.881 --> 48:55.751
Noah Goldstein was my
counselor my fresh man year.

48:55.821 --> 48:59.281
That's probably where I got the
idea for the ice pick for my book.

49:01.321 --> 49:03.450
Funny how the
subconscious works.

49:03.660 --> 49:05.150
Hilarious.

49:07.330 --> 49:11.270
- Hazel's my friend.
- Your friend took out her whole family.

49:11.330 --> 49:14.430
Yes, she helped me
understand homicidal impulse.

49:14.470 --> 49:16.440
I thought you would have
learned that at school.

49:18.240 --> 49:20.210
Only in theory.

49:20.240 --> 49:25.409
But you know all about homicidal
impulse, don't you, shooter?

49:27.779 --> 49:30.379
Not in theory, in practice.

49:30.449 --> 49:34.249
What happened? Did
you get sucked into it?

49:34.289 --> 49:37.159
Did you like it too much?

49:38.829 --> 49:41.659
I don't know what
you're talking about.

49:43.529 --> 49:46.259
Tell me about the coke, Nick.

49:48.338 --> 49:51.328
The day you shot
those two tourists...

49:51.408 --> 49:53.378
how much coke did you do?

49:57.178 --> 50:00.378
Come on, you can tell me.

50:06.318 --> 50:10.188
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

50:10.228 --> 50:13.457
They never tested
you, did they?

50:13.497 --> 50:16.467
Internal Affairs knew.

50:18.527 --> 50:21.527
Your wife knew
too, didn't she?

50:26.837 --> 50:29.367
She knew what was going on.

50:32.247 --> 50:34.236
I think you got too
close to the flame.

50:42.256 --> 50:44.246
I think you liked it.

50:48.556 --> 50:51.356
That's why she killed herself.

51:06.575 --> 51:08.565
Hi, hon.

51:12.785 --> 51:16.275
You two have met, haven't you?

51:24.824 --> 51:28.354
You're gonna make a
terrific character, Nick.

51:37.304 --> 51:40.878
She's on the phone.
She'll be right with you.

51:40.908 --> 51:45.573
- I'm gonna have to call you back.
- Detective, you can't go in...

51:45.613 --> 51:48.343
- Who's got access to my file?
- What are you talking about?

51:48.383 --> 51:50.473
Who has access to
my goddamn file?

51:50.553 --> 51:54.383
Nobody. It's a confidential
psychiatric record. It would be illegal.

51:54.453 --> 51:57.223
Don't you fucking lie to me!

51:57.293 --> 51:59.263
It was Internal
Affairs, wasn't it?

51:59.333 --> 52:00.353
No, please.

52:00.433 --> 52:03.403
- Who?
- It's Nilson.

52:15.242 --> 52:16.612
What do you want, Curran?

52:16.812 --> 52:18.302
You sold her my
file, didn't you?

52:18.342 --> 52:20.402
Who are you talking about?

52:20.452 --> 52:23.852
Catherine Tramell. How
much did she pay you?

52:24.182 --> 52:27.522
Hey, Curran, come
on! Damn it, stop it!

52:27.592 --> 52:28.852
How much?

52:31.221 --> 52:34.851
Hey, back off!
Back off, Curran!

52:34.891 --> 52:38.231
Nice and easy now.
Nice and easy.

52:38.301 --> 52:41.231
You fucked yourself, shooter.
You hear me? You are out!

52:41.301 --> 52:43.701
- Curran, take it easy.
- You are out!

52:45.441 --> 52:46.871
Save it, save it.

52:50.381 --> 52:52.571
- What's going down, Hoss?
- Nothing. I'll be okay.

52:52.651 --> 52:55.910
- They're gonna want your badge.
- I'm tired of being played with.

52:56.250 --> 52:58.580
You got a real conclusive
way of demonstrating that.

53:04.560 --> 53:08.190
She knows where I
live and breathe.

53:09.660 --> 53:11.630
She's coming after me, Gus.

53:12.630 --> 53:14.570
What is it you
got between you?

53:18.239 --> 53:22.229
- I don't know.
- Something, though.

53:22.309 --> 53:25.369
Something.

53:44.458 --> 53:46.428
Nick, are you there?

53:46.468 --> 53:49.398
Go away, Beth. I
don't want to see you.

53:55.638 --> 53:58.468
I still have my key.

54:00.278 --> 54:02.208
Put them on the
table and leave.

54:04.677 --> 54:07.447
Put them on the
goddamn table and leave!

54:07.517 --> 54:10.547
Damn it! Don't shove me out!
You owe me more than that!

54:13.227 --> 54:15.627
I don't owe you anything!

54:15.657 --> 54:18.527
And you don't owe me anything.

54:18.557 --> 54:21.657
We went to bed,
what, 10, 15 times?

54:21.727 --> 54:25.526
It wasn't memorable enough
to carry an obligation.

54:27.436 --> 54:30.196
Sometimes I really hate you.

54:30.236 --> 54:32.726
Why don't you get yourself some
friendly little therapist...

54:33.246 --> 54:35.436
to work out some
of that hostility?

54:35.476 --> 54:38.606
And maybe you can get
off once in a while.

54:41.516 --> 54:44.346
Are you nuts?

54:53.465 --> 54:54.725
I'm sorry.

54:57.265 --> 54:59.595
I don't usually act like that.

54:59.665 --> 55:02.435
How could you
give him my file?

55:02.505 --> 55:04.195
I had to!

55:04.275 --> 55:08.205
He was going to recommend
your discharge from the force.

55:08.245 --> 55:11.435
He didn't buy my evaluation.
He said I wasn't objective.

55:11.475 --> 55:15.384
So I made a deal with him to
review the session notes himself.

55:15.419 --> 55:17.614
I didn't think he'd
show them to anybody.

55:17.684 --> 55:20.554
- You did it for me?
- Yes.

55:20.624 --> 55:23.354
I care about you.
I did it for you.

55:28.564 --> 55:32.294
Go away. Please, just go away.

56:06.662 --> 56:09.602
I'm on my way.

56:59.820 --> 57:04.380
One shot. Close range.
Probably a. 38 caliber revolver.

57:05.650 --> 57:08.279
Give me your gun, Nick.

57:17.329 --> 57:19.729
You think that...

57:23.639 --> 57:27.539
I don't, Hoss. But I
got the minority opinion.

57:31.908 --> 57:36.538
Okay, I went after
him! I lost my temper.

57:36.618 --> 57:39.608
Do you have any evidence that he
showed your psychiatric file to anyone?

57:46.598 --> 57:48.558
We'll speak with you
afterwards, Dr. Garner.

57:48.598 --> 57:50.588
- I'd like to sit in.
- I'd really rather wait...

57:50.668 --> 57:54.597
It's all right if Dr. Garner sits in,
if Detective Curran doesn't object.

58:00.507 --> 58:03.477
- Where were you last night?
- Home, watching TV.

58:03.507 --> 58:05.307
All night?

58:05.947 --> 58:07.507
Yes, all night.

58:07.577 --> 58:09.737
Were you drinking?

58:13.517 --> 58:15.347
Yeah, I was drinking.

58:15.387 --> 58:18.356
- When did you start drinking again?
- A couple of days ago.

58:18.386 --> 58:21.626
I saw Detective Curran at his
apartment about 10:00 last night.

58:21.696 --> 58:23.596
He was sober and lucid.

58:23.666 --> 58:26.426
I asked him, in my capacity as
his departmental therapist...

58:26.466 --> 58:28.556
about his altercation
with Lieutenant Nilsen.

58:28.596 --> 58:31.896
He expressed regret and
displayed no hostility.

58:32.136 --> 58:35.736
- How long were you at his apartment?
- About 15 minutes.

58:35.906 --> 58:39.396
I saw there was no reason
for my concern and left.

58:39.476 --> 58:42.135
There's no smoking in
this building, Detective.

58:44.385 --> 58:46.345
What are you gonna do?
Charge me with smoking?

58:47.915 --> 58:51.585
Oh, for Christ's... All right, Nick,
I'm gonna ask you this just once.

58:51.655 --> 58:54.925
For the record, did
you kill Marty Nilsen?

58:56.725 --> 58:58.755
No.

58:58.925 --> 59:01.555
I'm gonna storm into his
office in front of everybody...

59:01.635 --> 59:03.604
in the middle of the day
and kill him that night?

59:03.634 --> 59:05.604
I'm not that dumb.

59:05.664 --> 59:09.624
Going after him before gets you off the
hook for killing him. That's your alibi.

59:09.674 --> 59:13.334
Like writing a book about killing a guy
gets you off the hook for killing him.

59:13.414 --> 59:14.394
Good point.

59:14.474 --> 59:16.414
What are you talking about?

59:16.444 --> 59:19.744
- A private joke, asshole.
- I don't think it's funny.

59:19.914 --> 59:21.384
You're going on leave...

59:22.454 --> 59:25.714
pending the outcome of
a psychiatric evaluation.

59:37.763 --> 59:40.463
I'll get my stuff in a minute.

59:44.843 --> 59:46.173
Thank you.

59:50.612 --> 59:52.702
It's the least I could do.

59:52.782 --> 59:55.612
Considering I got you into
this mess with those reports.

59:55.682 --> 59:58.452
No, I mean it. Thank you.

01:00:00.252 --> 01:00:03.222
How do you know Catherine
Tramell saw your file?

01:00:03.262 --> 01:00:06.922
She knows things about
me that I only told you.

01:00:07.162 --> 01:00:09.562
She must really be something.

01:00:09.632 --> 01:00:12.122
From a clinical point of view.

01:00:12.162 --> 01:00:14.761
- What was she like in school?
- I hardly knew her.

01:00:14.801 --> 01:00:16.601
She gave me the creeps.

01:00:16.671 --> 01:00:18.601
I don't know why.

01:00:22.711 --> 01:00:25.731
Get some rest. Promise?

01:00:31.651 --> 01:00:34.741
- I didn't mean what I said about...
- Yes, you did.

01:00:34.821 --> 01:00:37.790
I'm a big girl.
I can handle it.

01:01:01.649 --> 01:01:04.739
- You take care of yourself.
- What'd you find out about the parents?

01:01:04.819 --> 01:01:07.714
No lead, man.

01:01:07.749 --> 01:01:11.149
You're on psycho leave. I'm
talking to a possible wacko!

01:01:11.219 --> 01:01:14.159
You know I'm wacko.
What'd you find out?

01:01:17.659 --> 01:01:21.259
The boat blew. There was
a leak in the fuel line.

01:01:21.469 --> 01:01:25.298
There were two previous repairs and
a five mil policy on both of them.

01:01:25.498 --> 01:01:27.668
A real heavy investigation
but they got zilch.

01:01:27.708 --> 01:01:30.538
Big goose egg. It
was an "accident."

01:01:30.578 --> 01:01:34.168
I.A.'s gonna talk to you about Nilsen.
They're handling the investigation.

01:01:34.208 --> 01:01:36.738
Stay in touch with Dr. Garner.
It'll help on the evaluation.

01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:40.508
She killed him.

01:01:40.588 --> 01:01:41.848
Beth? Now you've got
Beth killing people?

01:01:42.188 --> 01:01:44.118
Catherine Tramell.
It's part of her game.

01:01:44.188 --> 01:01:48.217
First you got her stealing your
file, now she's killing Nilsen?

01:01:48.287 --> 01:01:51.227
Forget about her! Go
somewhere, sit in the sun.

01:01:51.297 --> 01:01:54.697
- Get her the hell out of your system!
- You don't buy it, do you?

01:01:54.767 --> 01:01:57.127
She knew nobody'd buy it.

01:01:57.197 --> 01:02:00.567
She knew I'd say she did
it and nobody'd buy it!

01:02:00.607 --> 01:02:03.767
She is screwing with your
head! Stay away from her!

01:02:31.335 --> 01:02:32.765
I heard what happened.

01:02:41.545 --> 01:02:44.605
What good's a shooter
without his gun?

01:02:44.675 --> 01:02:47.645
- How exactly did you find out?
- I have attorneys.

01:02:47.715 --> 01:02:50.685
They have friends.
I have friends.

01:02:50.755 --> 01:02:53.345
Money buys a lot of
attorneys and friends.

01:02:53.555 --> 01:02:55.684
I wouldn't know about that.
I don't have any money...

01:02:55.754 --> 01:02:59.554
I don't have any attorneys,
and Gus is my only real friend.

01:02:59.624 --> 01:03:01.684
I wasn't talking
about real friends.

01:03:06.194 --> 01:03:08.564
Why doesn't Gus like me?

01:03:09.334 --> 01:03:11.364
I like you.

01:03:11.574 --> 01:03:14.134
- You do?
- Yes.

01:03:15.204 --> 01:03:18.373
You want to go upstairs
and have a drink?

01:03:19.643 --> 01:03:21.373
I didn't think you'd ask me.

01:03:23.113 --> 01:03:25.383
I guess you don't know
your character that well.

01:03:25.583 --> 01:03:29.283
Maybe, but I'm learning.

01:03:29.353 --> 01:03:32.183
Pretty soon I'll know you
better than you know yourself.

01:03:32.223 --> 01:03:34.353
- Don't be so sure.
- Why not?

01:03:34.423 --> 01:03:37.193
- I'm very unpredictable.
- Unpredictable?

01:03:47.242 --> 01:03:49.402
You should put some
warmth into the place.

01:03:49.442 --> 01:03:52.202
You don't want it to
reflect your personality.

01:03:52.242 --> 01:03:53.802
I'm not trying
to fool anybody.

01:03:53.882 --> 01:03:56.712
Jack Daniels all right?
It's going to have to be.

01:03:56.752 --> 01:03:58.712
- Ice?
- Great.

01:04:07.221 --> 01:04:08.311
I was expecting you.

01:04:13.301 --> 01:04:14.791
K- Mart. A buck,
sixty-five.

01:04:21.271 --> 01:04:23.401
Why don't you let
me do this for you.

01:04:31.310 --> 01:04:33.650
You like watching
me do it, don't you?

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:39.250
Could I have a
cigarette too, please?

01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:41.760
I told you you'd
start smoking again.

01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:44.780
Would you light it for me?

01:04:49.999 --> 01:04:51.929
Thanks.

01:04:53.629 --> 01:04:58.159
So how much did you
pay Nilsen for my file?

01:04:58.199 --> 01:05:02.659
Isn't he the policeman
that you shot, shooter?

01:05:02.739 --> 01:05:05.039
What if I ask you not
to call me "shooter"?

01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:08.669
Okay. How about if
I call you Nicky?

01:05:10.119 --> 01:05:12.739
My wife used to call me Nicky.

01:05:13.088 --> 01:05:17.388
Yeah, I know. I like it.

01:05:20.758 --> 01:05:23.628
Cheers. My friend
call me Catherine.

01:05:23.658 --> 01:05:26.428
What did Manny
Vasquez call you?

01:05:26.468 --> 01:05:28.298
Bitch, mostly.

01:05:28.368 --> 01:05:30.698
But he meant it
affectionately.

01:05:32.338 --> 01:05:34.358
Do you have any coke?

01:05:35.438 --> 01:05:37.697
I just love coke
with Jack Daniels.

01:05:37.737 --> 01:05:39.707
Got a Pepsi in the fridge.

01:05:39.777 --> 01:05:43.337
It's not really the
same thing now, is it?

01:05:43.647 --> 01:05:45.617
No, it's not.

01:05:48.627 --> 01:05:50.587
So where's this going?

01:05:53.697 --> 01:05:56.357
What do you want from me?

01:05:58.697 --> 01:06:02.426
Say, "what do you want
from me, Catherine?"

01:06:03.736 --> 01:06:07.366
What the fuck do you
want from me, Catherine?

01:06:14.246 --> 01:06:16.336
Brought you something.

01:06:20.656 --> 01:06:25.485
Aren't you going
to say thank-you?

01:06:25.555 --> 01:06:28.825
- What's it about?
- It's about a boy who kills his parents.

01:06:28.895 --> 01:06:31.885
They have a play, and he
makes it look like an accident.

01:06:35.235 --> 01:06:36.395
Why did he do that?

01:06:38.265 --> 01:06:40.895
To see if he could
get away with it.

01:06:43.645 --> 01:06:45.305
When did you write this?

01:06:46.344 --> 01:06:49.314
You mean, did I write it
before my parents died?

01:06:53.914 --> 01:06:56.914
No. I wrote it
years afterwards.

01:06:58.654 --> 01:07:02.354
You wont stop following me around
now just because you're on leave?

01:07:02.394 --> 01:07:03.694
Absolutely not.

01:07:05.594 --> 01:07:07.494
Good, I'd miss you.

01:07:07.564 --> 01:07:09.723
You could get in trouble.
You're not really a cop anymore.

01:07:09.758 --> 01:07:12.893
- I'll risk it.
- Why take the risk?

01:07:13.233 --> 01:07:16.173
To see if I can
get away with it.

01:07:18.343 --> 01:07:21.873
- How's your new book?
- Practically writing itself.

01:07:23.213 --> 01:07:26.413
I'll be leaving about midnight,
in case you are going to follow me.

01:07:28.513 --> 01:07:32.682
- I'll be at Johnny Boz's club.
- I'll meet you there.

01:07:34.322 --> 01:07:36.252
Hi, Gus.

01:07:51.402 --> 01:07:55.501
Forgive me for asking, and I don't
mean to belabor the obvious...

01:07:55.541 --> 01:07:59.571
but why've you got your
head so far up your ass?

01:07:59.651 --> 01:08:02.671
She wants to play.
Fine, I can play.

01:08:04.451 --> 01:08:06.651
Everybody she plays with dies.

01:08:07.721 --> 01:08:10.311
I know what that's like.

01:09:04.738 --> 01:09:06.707
- Hi.
- Hi, baby.

01:16:39.309 --> 01:16:42.279
If you don't leave her
alone, I'll kill you.

01:16:48.348 --> 01:16:50.618
Let me ask you
something, "Rocky."

01:16:52.358 --> 01:16:53.788
Man to man.

01:16:56.258 --> 01:16:58.858
I think she's the
fuck of the century.

01:17:02.738 --> 01:17:04.728
What do you think?

01:17:09.238 --> 01:17:10.767
How long you been here?

01:17:12.407 --> 01:17:15.307
You like watching, don't you?

01:17:18.777 --> 01:17:20.777
She likes me to watch.

01:18:05.395 --> 01:18:07.365
Oh, God.

01:18:12.235 --> 01:18:14.395
<font color=#66CCCC>The
beach C</font>

01:18:57.413 --> 01:18:59.343
Good morning.

01:19:00.443 --> 01:19:02.743
I guess Roxy's not
taking this too well.

01:19:03.683 --> 01:19:06.772
She's seen me fuck
plenty of guys.

01:19:06.822 --> 01:19:11.652
Well, maybe she saw something
she's never seen before.

01:19:11.692 --> 01:19:13.422
She's seen everything before.

01:19:13.492 --> 01:19:16.862
Honey, I thought I'd
seen everything before.

01:19:17.192 --> 01:19:19.492
Did you really think
it was so special?

01:19:19.702 --> 01:19:23.362
I told her I thought it
was the fuck of the century.

01:19:28.442 --> 01:19:30.171
What do you think?

01:19:30.241 --> 01:19:34.231
I thought it was a
pretty good beginning.

01:19:38.151 --> 01:19:39.411
What about Roxy?

01:19:39.481 --> 01:19:41.751
Is she more fun?

01:19:41.821 --> 01:19:44.751
Would you like her
to join us sometime?

01:19:44.821 --> 01:19:49.551
- Did she join you and Johnny?
- No, he felt intimidated.

01:19:49.731 --> 01:19:51.820
Look what happened to him.

01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:54.800
Tell me, were you
frightened last night?

01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:56.390
That's the point, wasn't it?

01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:58.460
That's what made it so good.

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:03.830
- You shouldn't play this game.
- Why not? I like it.

01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:05.310
You're in over your head.

01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:09.300
Maybe, but this is how
I'll catch my killer.

01:20:13.450 --> 01:20:18.779
I'm not going to confess all my
secrets just because I have an orgasm.

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:21.479
You won't learn anything
I don't want you to know.

01:20:21.519 --> 01:20:25.489
Yes, I will. Then
I'll nail you.

01:20:25.524 --> 01:20:29.459
You'll just fall
in love with me.

01:20:29.499 --> 01:20:31.519
I'm in love with you already.

01:20:35.369 --> 01:20:37.569
But I'll nail you anyway.

01:20:38.768 --> 01:20:41.298
You can put that in your book.

01:20:45.548 --> 01:20:46.778
No

01:20:46.818 --> 01:20:50.768
Not that bar again

01:20:52.388 --> 01:20:55.618
Oh, I want to
know you're the one

01:20:55.788 --> 01:20:58.948
And I don't mean
the one I regret

01:21:01.397 --> 01:21:03.297
The heart's still going

01:21:03.367 --> 01:21:06.457
- Thought I'd find you here.
- Where the fuck you been?

01:21:06.497 --> 01:21:10.337
- I've been over to your place.
- Easy, cowboy, easy.

01:21:11.467 --> 01:21:15.377
- I wasn't there.
- I went over last night too.

01:21:16.447 --> 01:21:18.607
Well, I wasn't there either.

01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:25.916
You fucked her.

01:21:26.776 --> 01:21:29.816
God damned, dumb
son of a bitch!

01:21:29.851 --> 01:21:32.316
You fucked her!

01:21:32.386 --> 01:21:34.486
God damn! You are one...

01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:36.546
dumb son of a bitch!

01:21:36.596 --> 01:21:37.751
Next time, I'll use a rubber.

01:21:37.786 --> 01:21:42.596
I don't give a flying,
chili bean fart about that!

01:21:42.666 --> 01:21:45.636
- How about it, Harry.
How much? - Thirty-two.

01:21:45.806 --> 01:21:48.365
I'm worried about him,
he's worried about rubbers.

01:21:48.435 --> 01:21:50.335
You really gotta
protect yourself.

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:52.935
What in the hell for?

01:21:53.275 --> 01:21:58.475
You think I'm getting any? Sure, I
can get laid by blue haired women!

01:21:58.545 --> 01:22:02.245
- I don't like them!
- Don't knock it 'til you tried it!

01:22:08.395 --> 01:22:09.485
Feeling better?

01:22:09.525 --> 01:22:12.464
I feel fine.

01:22:12.494 --> 01:22:13.654
How could you fuck her?

01:22:15.294 --> 01:22:16.634
Come on.

01:22:20.534 --> 01:22:22.664
You want to die, Hoss?

01:22:22.874 --> 01:22:24.844
What is it? Those tourists?

01:22:26.314 --> 01:22:30.644
You still so bad about that, you're
wiggling your way into an ice pick?

01:22:30.684 --> 01:22:34.198
Got too many, god damn
tourists coming here anyway!

01:22:34.233 --> 01:22:37.713
- Hold it down.
- Plenty more where they came from!

01:22:47.593 --> 01:22:49.393
I'm not afraid of her.

01:22:49.433 --> 01:22:50.663
Why the hell not?

01:22:53.533 --> 01:22:55.503
I don't know.

01:22:55.533 --> 01:22:56.693
I'm just not.

01:22:56.902 --> 01:22:59.392
That's her pussy talking!
It ain't your brain!

01:22:59.472 --> 01:23:01.702
Come on.

01:23:10.282 --> 01:23:14.452
I.A. Did a track on Lieutenant
Martin D-for-dickhead Nilsen.

01:23:14.522 --> 01:23:17.682
They found a safety deposit
box with $50,000 in it...

01:23:17.762 --> 01:23:20.921
taken out three months
ago and not used since.

01:23:22.561 --> 01:23:25.731
That doesn't make any sense. She
didn't know me three months ago.

01:23:25.766 --> 01:23:27.661
Maybe it wasn't
her that paid him.

01:23:27.731 --> 01:23:30.571
Maybe the money was for something
else. How the fuck do I know?

01:23:33.731 --> 01:23:39.201
I'm just an old city cowboy trying
not to fall out of his saddle.

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:55.655
- All right, cowboy?
- Yeah.

01:23:55.690 --> 01:23:58.040
Come on. I'm going
to drive you home.

01:23:58.075 --> 01:24:00.390
In that little
piss-ant car of yours?

01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:04.490
Hell, no. I ain't getting no
back pain disability retirement.

01:24:04.570 --> 01:24:09.629
I'm gonna get a full pension and
a real gold-plate Seiko watch.

01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:11.274
I'm driving you...

01:24:11.309 --> 01:24:13.509
You're not driving
my Cadillac car!

01:24:13.579 --> 01:24:18.449
I won't let no head-up-his-ass
person drive my Cadillac car!

01:24:18.519 --> 01:24:19.679
So long!

01:26:19.634 --> 01:26:21.604
You wanna play? Come on!

01:27:32.331 --> 01:27:34.460
Lieutenant! I got
the information.

01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:36.475
Get it down here!

01:27:36.510 --> 01:27:38.840
You signed your name
to this crock of shit?

01:27:38.875 --> 01:27:40.500
Why not? It was an accident.

01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:44.570
"Your driving around North Beach and
this car won't get out of the way."

01:27:44.650 --> 01:27:46.510
I don't think she meant
to go off the edge.

01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:49.350
- Could we have him for a minute?
- No, you can't!

01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:53.340
Don't fuck with me on this. I don't
need a reason to put your ass in a sling.

01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:56.650
Full name is Roxanne Hardy. Last
known address, Cloverdale, California.

01:27:56.690 --> 01:27:58.679
No priors, no convictions.

01:27:58.759 --> 01:28:01.919
Car is registered
to Catherine Trammel.

01:28:02.129 --> 01:28:04.119
- You knew her!
- I met her at Trammel's house.

01:28:04.169 --> 01:28:05.629
All I did was
write her name down.

01:28:05.699 --> 01:28:08.789
You wrote her name down
and then big surprise...

01:28:08.839 --> 01:28:11.529
she rolls her car
down a hill and dies.

01:28:11.609 --> 01:28:15.469
- Is that what you're telling me?
- That's all I know.

01:28:15.509 --> 01:28:18.599
You know what then? Fuck you!

01:28:20.578 --> 01:28:23.568
- I want you at Dr. Garner's office...
- I told you to stay away from Trammel!

01:28:23.618 --> 01:28:25.378
You didn't tell me to
stay away from the car!

01:28:25.418 --> 01:28:29.718
- I want you at Dr. Garner's office!
- Who are you selling my file to now?

01:28:31.458 --> 01:28:34.618
You are out of control,
Curran. You hear me?

01:28:43.937 --> 01:28:46.837
Hello, Nick. This
is Dr. Myron...

01:28:46.907 --> 01:28:48.837
and Dr. McElwaine.

01:28:50.477 --> 01:28:55.347
They've been asked to consult with
me on this psychiatric evaluation.

01:28:55.517 --> 01:28:57.307
Sit down.

01:29:04.327 --> 01:29:07.756
We understand you're having difficulty
controlling your temper lately.

01:29:07.826 --> 01:29:10.556
Only in regard to one person.

01:29:11.626 --> 01:29:15.496
Do you think Lieutenant
Nilsen deserved to die?

01:29:16.666 --> 01:29:18.606
I didn't know him well enough.

01:29:18.636 --> 01:29:19.866
I won't miss him.

01:29:22.676 --> 01:29:25.536
When you recollect
your childhood...

01:29:25.606 --> 01:29:28.236
are your recollections
pleasing to you?

01:29:31.245 --> 01:29:35.655
Number one: I don't remember how
often I jerked off, but it was a lot.

01:29:35.685 --> 01:29:37.915
Number two: I wasn't
pissed off at my dad...

01:29:38.255 --> 01:29:40.845
even when I was old enough to know
what he and mom did in the bedroom.

01:29:40.925 --> 01:29:44.255
Number three: I don't look
in the toilet before I flush.

01:29:44.325 --> 01:29:47.665
Number four: I haven't
wet my bed for a long time.

01:29:47.735 --> 01:29:49.855
Number five...

01:29:49.935 --> 01:29:52.335
why don't the two of
you go fuck yourselves.

01:29:52.365 --> 01:29:54.334
I'm out of here.

01:30:01.744 --> 01:30:03.734
What's your problem?
I'm trying to help.

01:30:03.814 --> 01:30:05.644
- Why won't you let me?
- I don't want your help!

01:30:05.714 --> 01:30:07.614
- I don't need it.
- Yes, you do!

01:30:07.684 --> 01:30:09.674
Something's going on.

01:30:09.754 --> 01:30:11.774
You're sleeping
with her, aren't you?

01:30:11.824 --> 01:30:15.784
- Why are you interested in her?
- My interest is in you, not her.

01:30:15.824 --> 01:30:17.793
She seduces and
manipulates people.

01:30:17.863 --> 01:30:20.553
- She'll do anything she can...
- I thought you hardly knew her?

01:30:20.633 --> 01:30:22.923
- I know the type. I'm a psychologist.
- That means...

01:30:23.263 --> 01:30:25.753
you manipulate people too!

01:30:25.833 --> 01:30:27.923
You're a practicing
psychologist.

01:30:28.303 --> 01:30:30.363
You're better at
it than she is!

01:30:31.903 --> 01:30:34.873
I feel sorry for you!

01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:34.320
I should have known.

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.930
I came in to the house.

01:31:41.010 --> 01:31:42.870
When we were down
on the beach...

01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:47.300
she looked at me so strangely.

01:31:49.809 --> 01:31:51.979
She left right after you.

01:31:56.719 --> 01:31:58.709
I...

01:31:59.759 --> 01:32:02.819
I shouldn't have
let her watch us.

01:32:04.759 --> 01:32:07.419
She wanted to watch
me all the time.

01:32:13.838 --> 01:32:17.928
She tried to kill
you, didn't she?

01:32:18.278 --> 01:32:22.468
- Did you like her to watch you?
- You think I told her to kill you?

01:32:22.678 --> 01:32:24.478
No.

01:32:27.448 --> 01:32:31.388
Everybody that I care about...

01:32:31.458 --> 01:32:33.418
dies.

01:32:52.907 --> 01:32:54.847
Make love to me.

01:33:14.396 --> 01:33:18.356
You think she
killed Johnny Boz?

01:33:18.396 --> 01:33:21.455
For what, to set me up?

01:33:21.535 --> 01:33:23.905
She loved me. She
wouldn't frame me.

01:33:24.905 --> 01:33:29.275
- Maybe she got jealous of Johnny too.
- No, she didn't.

01:33:29.345 --> 01:33:32.315
She'd never get
jealous before.

01:33:32.375 --> 01:33:34.365
She got excited.

01:33:37.415 --> 01:33:40.385
I don't have luck with women.

01:33:41.855 --> 01:33:43.985
There was this girl...

01:33:44.325 --> 01:33:46.794
I met when I was in college.

01:33:46.824 --> 01:33:48.384
I slept with her once.

01:33:48.464 --> 01:33:52.954
She started following me
around, taking my picture.

01:33:53.334 --> 01:33:57.464
She dyed her hair,
copied my clothes.

01:33:57.534 --> 01:33:59.504
Lisa...

01:34:00.544 --> 01:34:02.474
something, Oberman.

01:34:06.544 --> 01:34:08.533
It was awful.

01:34:10.553 --> 01:34:12.543
I thought you didn't
make confessions.

01:34:16.853 --> 01:34:18.883
I never did before.

01:34:29.303 --> 01:34:30.463
Another nice girl.

01:34:49.452 --> 01:34:50.922
How old was she
when it happened?

01:34:50.952 --> 01:34:52.942
Sixteen.

01:34:53.292 --> 01:34:55.551
We seal juvenile records
until they're deceased.

01:34:55.621 --> 01:34:57.561
That's why you couldn't
find it in your computer.

01:34:57.631 --> 01:35:00.421
What was the motive?

01:35:00.501 --> 01:35:03.401
She said she didn't know.
Just sort of did it on impulse.

01:35:03.431 --> 01:35:07.421
The razor just happened to be
there. That's what she said.

01:35:12.941 --> 01:35:16.880
- Help yourself to some coffee.
- Thanks.

01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:19.880
I don't understand what
the hell is going on here.

01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:22.410
It ain't hard, Hoss.
This young farm girl...

01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:25.820
got tired of all that attention
going to her little brothers...

01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:27.950
so she fixed them.

01:35:28.290 --> 01:35:31.280
Just like old Hazel Dobkins
fixed her whole family.

01:35:31.330 --> 01:35:33.890
Except young Roxy, here,
didn't use a wedding present.

01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:36.560
She used daddy's razor.

01:35:45.539 --> 01:35:47.439
Sure makes you wonder
what they talk about...

01:35:47.509 --> 01:35:50.499
when they sit in front
of the campfire at night.

01:35:50.549 --> 01:35:53.949
You ever met a friend of hers
that hasn't killed somebody?

01:35:53.979 --> 01:35:56.979
Must of beat your ordinary,
every day girl talk.

01:35:57.014 --> 01:35:59.579
I'm not sure,
anymore, she did it.

01:35:59.619 --> 01:36:01.679
Which one we
talking about now?

01:36:01.859 --> 01:36:04.948
We know Hazel did it. We
know young Roxy did it.

01:36:05.328 --> 01:36:06.518
And the other one...

01:36:06.558 --> 01:36:11.898
She's got that magna cum laude
pussy that fried up your brain.

01:36:31.017 --> 01:36:33.577
"Oberman, Mark W., Donald M."

01:36:34.657 --> 01:36:36.017
Sorry, no "Lisa."

01:36:36.317 --> 01:36:38.757
You sure about the year?

01:36:38.927 --> 01:36:41.917
Catherine Tramell
graduated in '83.

01:36:41.957 --> 01:36:45.727
She said Lisa Oberman
was here at the same time.

01:36:48.497 --> 01:36:50.296
Yeah, we have Tramell.

01:36:53.736 --> 01:36:55.326
But no Lisa Oberman.

01:36:55.376 --> 01:36:57.706
Are you sure? There
can't be a mistake?

01:36:59.506 --> 01:37:01.906
Only if you're
making it, Detective.

01:37:16.495 --> 01:37:19.295
Hazel, this is Nick. I
told you all about him.

01:37:19.325 --> 01:37:21.355
Nick, this is Hazel Dobkins.

01:37:21.435 --> 01:37:23.485
You're the
shooter, aren't you?

01:37:23.565 --> 01:37:25.535
How are you?

01:37:25.565 --> 01:37:28.365
Fine, thank you. Can I
speak to you for a minute?

01:37:28.435 --> 01:37:32.735
Would you wait for me in
the car? I'll be right there.

01:37:33.945 --> 01:37:35.744
Good-bye, shooter.

01:37:37.484 --> 01:37:40.344
You like to hang out
with murderers, or what?

01:37:40.414 --> 01:37:43.474
- You know that Roxy was involved...
- Yes, of course, I knew.

01:37:43.554 --> 01:37:46.484
I write about unusual people, and
sometimes when I do my research...

01:37:46.524 --> 01:37:48.784
I get involved with them.

01:37:48.824 --> 01:37:51.414
It happened with you.

01:37:52.594 --> 01:37:55.494
Killing isn't like smoking.

01:37:55.534 --> 01:37:57.724
You can quit.

01:38:00.003 --> 01:38:02.433
I gotta go.

01:38:03.633 --> 01:38:05.663
I promised I'd get
her home by 6:00.

01:38:05.743 --> 01:38:08.533
She just loves
"America's Most Wanted."

01:38:08.573 --> 01:38:12.343
There was no Lisa Oberman
when you were at Berkeley.

01:38:12.383 --> 01:38:15.573
What are you doing?
Checking up on me?

01:38:15.613 --> 01:38:18.673
For what? I said "Hoberman."

01:38:21.523 --> 01:38:25.462
"Hoberman." Lisa
Hoberman, with an H.

01:38:26.822 --> 01:38:28.792
You do?

01:38:30.802 --> 01:38:33.662
All right. Thank
you very much.

01:38:35.632 --> 01:38:39.542
You know I can get my
butt kicked for this.

01:38:39.602 --> 01:38:41.772
- You're not even supposed to be here.
- Come on, Sam.

01:38:41.842 --> 01:38:44.572
- This is only gonna take a minute.
- Yeah.

01:38:53.481 --> 01:38:55.381
Bring it up.

01:38:57.761 --> 01:39:00.451
That's Dr. Garner, isn't it?

01:39:02.431 --> 01:39:04.761
Bring up '83.

01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:23.770
You shouldn't leave
your door open.

01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:28.750
I didn't. There's something
wrong with my lock.

01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:30.410
What do you want?

01:39:30.450 --> 01:39:31.609
Tell me about Catherine.

01:39:34.529 --> 01:39:37.289
She told you, didn't she?

01:39:37.329 --> 01:39:39.819
What did she tell me?

01:39:42.669 --> 01:39:45.499
I slept with her
once in school.

01:39:45.539 --> 01:39:48.729
I was just a kid.
I was experimenting.

01:39:48.809 --> 01:39:52.369
It was just that one time.

01:39:52.439 --> 01:39:54.878
She developed a
fixation on me.

01:39:55.348 --> 01:39:58.408
She styled her hair like mine, wore
the same kind of clothes as I did.

01:39:58.478 --> 01:40:00.468
It scared me.

01:40:03.488 --> 01:40:06.418
Isn't that what she told you?

01:40:06.488 --> 01:40:08.793
She said it was you.

01:40:08.828 --> 01:40:10.818
You dressed like her. You
dyed your hair blonde...

01:40:10.898 --> 01:40:12.888
I did dye my hair. It had
nothing to do with her.

01:40:12.928 --> 01:40:15.698
- I was a redhead for a while too.
- Did you know Noah Goldstein?

01:40:15.728 --> 01:40:17.857
- I had him for two classes.
- You saw all the reports.

01:40:18.367 --> 01:40:19.667
Phil copied you. You
never said anything!

01:40:19.737 --> 01:40:21.527
What am I supposed to say?

01:40:21.567 --> 01:40:24.837
"I'm not gay, but I
did fuck your suspect"?

01:40:26.737 --> 01:40:31.677
I was embarrassed. It was the
only time I'd been with a woman.

01:40:33.477 --> 01:40:35.537
She's really sick, you know.

01:40:35.617 --> 01:40:37.447
Do you know what she's doing?

01:40:37.487 --> 01:40:40.617
She knows I went to Berkeley.
She knows I knew Noah.

01:40:40.686 --> 01:40:42.656
She makes up this
story about me.

01:40:42.686 --> 01:40:45.386
She's handing you somebody
who's obsessed with her.

01:40:45.426 --> 01:40:47.416
She didn't hand you to me.
She doesn't know who you are.

01:40:47.496 --> 01:40:48.896
You told me about
a Lisa Hoberman.

01:40:49.366 --> 01:40:52.526
She knows you'd find out who
Lisa is. You're a good cop.

01:40:53.736 --> 01:40:55.706
She tell you casually?

01:40:55.766 --> 01:40:57.826
Make it seem irrelevant?

01:40:59.636 --> 01:41:01.626
Did she tell you in bed?

01:41:04.915 --> 01:41:07.405
That's what I'd do.

01:41:09.745 --> 01:41:11.685
Why'd you change your name?

01:41:11.715 --> 01:41:14.685
I got married. He
called me "Beth."

01:41:14.755 --> 01:41:17.315
He was on staff at
the clinic in Salinas.

01:41:17.395 --> 01:41:19.585
Didn't last long.

01:41:22.725 --> 01:41:25.595
Do you really think that
I could kill someone?

01:41:25.665 --> 01:41:27.564
I never even met Johnny Boz!

01:41:27.604 --> 01:41:30.894
And what about Nilsen? What
motive would I have to kill him?

01:41:31.374 --> 01:41:33.864
- You should get that lock fixed.
- God...

01:41:33.904 --> 01:41:37.604
She's evil! She's brilliant!

01:42:02.563 --> 01:42:04.868
Did I scare you?

01:42:04.903 --> 01:42:07.493
I wanted to surprise you.

01:42:07.573 --> 01:42:10.503
- What's wrong?
- I found Lisa Hoberman.

01:42:10.573 --> 01:42:12.563
Oh, you did? What's she doing?

01:42:15.812 --> 01:42:18.642
You're not going to
tell me what she's doing.

01:42:18.712 --> 01:42:21.882
- I thought we were done playing games.
- I did too.

01:42:22.352 --> 01:42:23.842
She said you got it backwards.

01:42:23.882 --> 01:42:26.722
She said you styled
your hair like she did.

01:42:26.792 --> 01:42:28.812
And you believed her.

01:42:29.892 --> 01:42:35.692
I had to go to the campus police
and file a report about her.

01:42:35.732 --> 01:42:39.591
- I suppose you still think I kill people too?
- No.

01:42:43.571 --> 01:42:45.471
Liar.

01:42:48.881 --> 01:42:52.711
- Who'd you say you're with?
- Homicide, San Francisco.

01:42:55.481 --> 01:42:57.581
Here we go.

01:42:57.651 --> 01:42:59.620
Kind of.

01:42:59.650 --> 01:43:02.180
There was a report about
Lisa Hoberman, January, 1980.

01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:04.780
- But it's out of here.
- Who's got it?

01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:07.850
One of your guys. Nilsen.

01:43:08.230 --> 01:43:10.490
- You know him?
- Yeah.

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.730
Thanks a lot.

01:43:12.770 --> 01:43:15.700
Tell him to bring it back.
He's had it a whole year.

01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:19.230
So Nilsen had a report on Beth.
You don't know what was in it.

01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:21.760
- Catherine told me what was in it.
- If she's telling you the truth.

01:43:21.810 --> 01:43:23.569
Gus, don't you get it?

01:43:23.639 --> 01:43:25.639
If Beth killed Johnny
Boz to frame Catherine...

01:43:25.679 --> 01:43:27.649
she wouldn't want anybody to
know what happened in Berkeley!

01:43:27.679 --> 01:43:30.739
But Nilsen found out about it. That
gives her the motive to kill him.

01:43:30.819 --> 01:43:33.789
How did she know Nilsen
found out, if it happened?

01:43:33.849 --> 01:43:36.249
He probably asked her!

01:43:36.459 --> 01:43:38.819
She'd have to be nuttier
than a 20 pound fruitcake!

01:43:38.889 --> 01:43:41.759
She's not the one who hangs
out with multiple murderers!

01:43:41.799 --> 01:43:44.459
- You're girlfriend is!
- She's a writer! That's her job!

01:43:44.529 --> 01:43:47.628
I don't buy it. There must be somebody
at Berkeley who knows what happened!

01:43:47.698 --> 01:43:49.638
I know what happened!
Catherine told me!

01:43:49.698 --> 01:43:52.758
- Everything she says has checked out!
- You got tweety birds...

01:43:52.838 --> 01:43:54.868
fluttering around
in your head!

01:43:54.938 --> 01:43:57.268
You think you can fuck like
minks, raise rug rats...

01:43:57.438 --> 01:43:59.438
and live happily ever after?

01:43:59.478 --> 01:44:01.448
Oh, man!

01:44:13.527 --> 01:44:15.887
How'd you get in here?

01:44:15.927 --> 01:44:17.797
What's this?

01:44:17.867 --> 01:44:20.927
I decided to give
you a second chance.

01:44:21.267 --> 01:44:25.327
- I missed you.
- I wasn't gone long enough.

01:44:25.507 --> 01:44:27.527
Did you miss me?

01:44:27.607 --> 01:44:29.537
No.

01:44:39.516 --> 01:44:43.346
Why don't you come over
here and tell me no.

01:44:46.326 --> 01:44:48.516
- I've seen them before.
- Yeah?

01:44:48.556 --> 01:44:51.356
Well, you might
not see them again.

01:44:51.526 --> 01:44:53.556
My book's nearly finished.

01:44:53.596 --> 01:44:55.825
My detective's almost dead.

01:44:55.895 --> 01:44:57.695
So I've got time
for a last cigarette?

01:44:57.765 --> 01:44:58.925
Afterwards.

01:45:11.845 --> 01:45:14.615
I've got to do some
research tomorrow morning.

01:45:14.685 --> 01:45:17.655
I'm good at research.
I'll help you.

01:45:17.685 --> 01:45:19.554
No, thanks.

01:45:19.624 --> 01:45:21.714
What are you researching?

01:45:21.794 --> 01:45:23.344
Oh...

01:45:23.554 --> 01:45:25.894
a new ending to your book.

01:45:26.264 --> 01:45:29.254
Oh, really? What's the twist?

01:45:29.334 --> 01:45:33.294
The detective falls
for the wrong girl.

01:45:33.334 --> 01:45:35.864
But he doesn't die.

01:45:37.744 --> 01:45:40.734
So what happens to him?

01:45:41.843 --> 01:45:45.333
They fuck like minks,
raise rug rats...

01:45:45.543 --> 01:45:47.343
and live happily ever after.

01:45:48.853 --> 01:45:50.783
It won't sell.

01:45:51.883 --> 01:45:53.323
Why not?

01:45:54.953 --> 01:45:57.583
Somebody has to die.

01:46:00.263 --> 01:46:01.723
Why?

01:46:02.863 --> 01:46:05.892
Somebody always does.

01:46:22.852 --> 01:46:25.312
Morning. I'm looking
for a Dr. Garner.

01:46:25.352 --> 01:46:28.881
She doesn't work here anymore. She's
in San Francisco with the police.

01:46:28.921 --> 01:46:30.681
Actually, I'm looking
for her husband.

01:46:30.721 --> 01:46:33.881
- He works here too, doesn't he?
- Dr. Joseph Garner?

01:46:33.921 --> 01:46:35.821
- She married?
- You know him?

01:46:35.861 --> 01:46:38.761
He died about five
or six years ago.

01:46:38.801 --> 01:46:42.731
- How did he die?
- He was shot.

01:46:44.801 --> 01:46:46.861
Thank you.

01:46:46.941 --> 01:46:50.810
He was walking home from work.

01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:53.370
He only lived a couple
of blocks from the clinic.

01:46:53.410 --> 01:46:54.840
Somebody just drove
by and shot him.

01:46:54.910 --> 01:46:58.710
- What was the murder weapon?
- Revolver,.38. Unrecovered.

01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:01.410
- Watch yourself.
- Were there any suspects?

01:47:01.450 --> 01:47:04.850
No suspects, no
motive. Unsolved.

01:47:04.890 --> 01:47:07.380
Was his wife ever a suspect?

01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:11.890
One of your guys was down
here from Frisco a year ago.

01:47:12.230 --> 01:47:14.459
He was asking the
same, exact thing.

01:47:14.669 --> 01:47:16.429
You mind telling
me what's going on?

01:47:16.629 --> 01:47:19.259
Routine.

01:47:19.339 --> 01:47:21.274
That's exactly what he said.

01:47:21.309 --> 01:47:24.309
Now I got two of you guys
telling me it's "routine."

01:47:24.344 --> 01:47:26.639
You remember what the
other guy's name was?

01:47:27.779 --> 01:47:31.839
No. I can't really
say that I do.

01:47:31.879 --> 01:47:34.649
Nilsen?

01:47:34.719 --> 01:47:36.649
Yeah. That was it.

01:47:38.918 --> 01:47:41.758
- So was she ever a suspect?
- No.

01:47:42.828 --> 01:47:44.318
There was some talk.

01:47:44.358 --> 01:47:46.388
But it never panned out.

01:47:46.458 --> 01:47:49.428
- What kind of talk?
- Girlfriend.

01:47:49.628 --> 01:47:51.728
He had a girlfriend?

01:47:51.798 --> 01:47:53.268
No.

01:47:54.908 --> 01:47:56.738
She did.

01:47:58.808 --> 01:48:02.267
But like I said,
it never panned out.

01:48:04.347 --> 01:48:06.837
- Thank you.
- Hope that helped you out.

01:48:07.217 --> 01:48:11.347
Yes, you did. You sure did.

01:48:41.516 --> 01:48:42.776
I missed you.

01:48:44.956 --> 01:48:46.315
I finished my research.

01:48:46.385 --> 01:48:49.755
- I finished my book.
- So how does it end?

01:48:50.825 --> 01:48:52.795
I told you.

01:48:52.855 --> 01:48:54.795
She kills him.

01:48:57.465 --> 01:48:59.555
Good-bye, Nick.

01:49:01.305 --> 01:49:03.355
Good-bye?

01:49:03.435 --> 01:49:06.335
Yeah. I finished my book.

01:49:08.805 --> 01:49:10.864
Didn't you hear me?

01:49:10.944 --> 01:49:12.774
Your character's dead.

01:49:14.584 --> 01:49:16.204
Good-bye.

01:49:20.484 --> 01:49:22.544
What do you want, flowers?

01:49:22.584 --> 01:49:24.884
I'll send you an
autographed copy.

01:49:26.854 --> 01:49:29.454
What is this,
some kind of joke?

01:49:34.293 --> 01:49:35.493
You playing a game here?

01:49:36.603 --> 01:49:38.533
The games are over.

01:49:40.303 --> 01:49:41.773
You were right.

01:49:41.843 --> 01:49:46.273
It was the fuck of
the century, shooter.

01:49:59.552 --> 01:50:00.952
I'll be right there.

01:50:28.551 --> 01:50:30.521
Catherine Tramell's
roommate, freshman year?

01:50:30.551 --> 01:50:34.511
I just got a call from her.
She's in Oakland. Come on!

01:50:36.621 --> 01:50:38.611
I've been phoning people
from her dorm all day.

01:50:38.831 --> 01:50:40.451
She must've heard I
was trying to reach her.

01:50:40.531 --> 01:50:44.520
Says she knows all about
Catherine and Lisa Hoberman.

01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:48.460
You feeling okay?

01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:51.970
Here's something else.

01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:55.570
Johnny Boz's psychiatrist
has an office on Van Ness.

01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:57.510
Guess who he
shares space with?

01:50:57.540 --> 01:51:00.380
Dr. Elizabeth Garner.

01:51:02.950 --> 01:51:06.509
What in the hell's
the matter with you?

01:51:19.499 --> 01:51:22.529
I'll be in suite 405.

01:51:24.539 --> 01:51:26.869
- Where the hell you going?
- I'm going with you.

01:51:26.939 --> 01:51:29.403
You're on leave, Hoss.

01:51:29.438 --> 01:51:31.868
It ain't gonna take long.

01:53:54.442 --> 01:53:55.712
Freeze!

01:53:55.782 --> 01:53:57.412
What are you doing here?

01:53:57.482 --> 01:53:59.382
Put your fucking hands up!

01:53:59.452 --> 01:54:01.382
I got a message
to meet Gus here.

01:54:01.452 --> 01:54:03.542
- Where is he?
- Don't you move!

01:54:03.622 --> 01:54:06.422
I know about your husband!
You still like girls, Beth?

01:54:07.462 --> 01:54:10.761
- What?
- Take you hands out of your pocket!

01:54:10.831 --> 01:54:13.421
- Take them out!
- What's wrong with you?

01:54:13.501 --> 01:54:14.791
Take them out!

01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:36.650
I loved you.

01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:54.840
Oh, God!

01:55:17.829 --> 01:55:20.558
What made you
think she had a gun?

01:55:22.328 --> 01:55:25.818
What was she doing here?
What was Gus doing here?

01:55:29.508 --> 01:55:31.438
Lieutenant.

01:55:59.437 --> 01:56:00.767
One of ours.

01:56:03.567 --> 01:56:06.266
Jesus.

01:56:06.336 --> 01:56:08.676
We'll have to check
Beth's apartment.

01:56:11.746 --> 01:56:13.476
Thirty-eight
caliber revolver.

01:56:13.546 --> 01:56:16.346
In the bookcase,
behind some books.

01:56:18.686 --> 01:56:21.776
Have ballistics
check it for Nilsen.

01:56:21.826 --> 01:56:25.446
Lieutenant. You
better come in here.

01:56:53.754 --> 01:56:56.554
I guess that's it.

01:57:11.704 --> 01:57:16.363
Definitely not. We feel all the
evidence points to Dr. Elizabeth Garner.

01:57:16.403 --> 01:57:18.393
We checked. It's her size.

01:57:18.473 --> 01:57:20.633
She probably heard you on the
stairway and dumped this stuff.

01:57:20.673 --> 01:57:22.443
There's no suite 405.

01:57:22.513 --> 01:57:24.443
Catherine Tramell's
freshman roommate is dead.

01:57:24.513 --> 01:57:26.453
She died of leukemia
two years ago.

01:57:26.513 --> 01:57:29.143
- Here's a fax of her death certificate.
- What about Salinas?

01:57:29.353 --> 01:57:32.183
Yeah, hold on. Jack!

01:57:33.723 --> 01:57:35.783
Did you check Nilsen's office
for any files on Beth Garner?

01:57:35.863 --> 01:57:39.722
No police report from Berkeley.
Nothing at all about Salinas.

01:57:39.762 --> 01:57:42.592
I'm back.

01:57:42.632 --> 01:57:44.492
Great.

01:57:44.562 --> 01:57:47.762
Ballistics says the. 38 we found in
her apartment was used on Nilsen.

01:57:47.832 --> 01:57:50.362
No registration. They're
checking with Salinas.

01:57:50.402 --> 01:57:53.202
The ice pick was the same brand
and model as the Boz weapon.

01:57:53.412 --> 01:57:55.642
Checked the tape machines at Dr.
Garner's apartment and office...

01:57:55.712 --> 01:57:57.372
both here and the
one on Van Ness.

01:57:57.412 --> 01:57:58.742
There's no message
from Gus on any of them.

01:57:58.782 --> 01:58:00.752
The tape in her
apartment was unused.

01:58:00.812 --> 01:58:03.581
Johnny Boz's psychiatrist
says he thinks he remembers...

01:58:03.651 --> 01:58:06.741
Dr. Garner and Boz meeting at
a Christmas party at his house.

01:58:06.821 --> 01:58:08.791
Ayear ago.

01:58:11.691 --> 01:58:14.721
You just can't tell
about people, can you?

01:58:16.501 --> 01:58:20.801
Even the ones you think
you know inside and out.

01:58:23.841 --> 01:58:26.600
Congratulations, Curran.

01:59:26.298 --> 01:59:28.198
I heard about what happened.

01:59:30.498 --> 01:59:33.468
On TV.

01:59:44.477 --> 01:59:48.277
I can't allow myself
to care about you.

01:59:51.317 --> 01:59:54.257
I can't allow myself...

01:59:54.287 --> 01:59:56.817
to care.

01:59:59.866 --> 02:00:02.266
I don't want to do this.

02:00:02.336 --> 02:00:05.196
Please. I don't
want to do this.

02:00:06.666 --> 02:00:09.506
I lose everybody.

02:00:09.576 --> 02:00:12.506
I don't want to lose you.

02:01:57.871 --> 02:01:59.841
What do we do now?

02:02:01.611 --> 02:02:04.911
Fuck like minks...

02:02:05.251 --> 02:02:08.651
raise rug rats and
live happily ever after.

02:02:19.700 --> 02:02:21.250
I hate rug rats.

02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:27.240
Fuck like minks,
forget the rug rats...

02:02:27.300 --> 02:02:30.270
and live happily ever after.
