07:17.062 --> 07:20.105
[beatboxing]

07:21.900 --> 07:22.899
[both gasp]

07:23.026 --> 07:24.943
Okay, he's alive. Whew.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.736
That would've been
twice this week.

07:26.864 --> 07:28.905
[beatboxing]

07:29.074 --> 07:30.782
Okay, you're hammering a nail,

07:30.909 --> 07:33.201
But you're not making
a big deal about it.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.661
It's fun. You're having fun.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.371
Like this? Eh...

07:36.415 --> 07:37.747
No, now it looks
like you're in pain.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.499
-Think of something happy.
-Ah...

07:39.668 --> 07:41.042
I said something happy,

07:41.128 --> 07:42.878
Not whose body
is in your basement.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.337
Ugh! Why is this so hard?

07:44.465 --> 07:45.547
Just be natural.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.132
You haven't blinked
in like ten minutes.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.758
[teddy]
okay, tell me when to blink.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.427
[linda]
just blink
how you normally blink.

07:50.512 --> 07:51.803
-[teddy] I only blink at night.
-[linda] that's sleeping.

07:51.889 --> 07:52.846
[bob sighs]

07:52.931 --> 07:54.055
Dad's not texting me back.

07:54.183 --> 07:55.932
Oh, bob. Just put
that thing down

07:56.092 --> 07:57.267
And don't even worry about it.

07:57.352 --> 07:59.394
No, not you, teddy.
Keep holding the hammer.

07:59.480 --> 08:00.979
Okay, now you're
holding it weird,

08:01.106 --> 08:02.397
Like you've never
held a hammer before.

08:02.483 --> 08:03.815
[teddy]
I don't know
what to do with my body!

08:03.901 --> 08:06.151
Okay, uh, what's
a different way to text

08:06.236 --> 08:08.069
"please don't destroy
our kids' childhoods"?

08:08.155 --> 08:10.780
Just quit worrying about it,
everything's gonna be okay.

08:10.866 --> 08:12.324
Teddy, did your mouth
start twitching?

08:12.367 --> 08:14.367
Eh, it's hard to look normal
for this long.

08:14.453 --> 08:16.244
Maybe after I finish these,
I'll just go down there.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.538
'cause it, you know,
it's fun when your dad shows up.

08:18.624 --> 08:19.706
To check on your grandpa.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.209
It's kinda slow here
with the rain anyway.

08:22.294 --> 08:23.710
I don't know,
won't that look like

08:23.795 --> 08:25.378
We don't trust your dad
with our kids?

08:25.464 --> 08:27.881
No! No, 'cause I'm gonna be...

08:27.966 --> 08:29.674
A cool, laid-back buffer

08:29.760 --> 08:31.384
Who's all about just having fun.

08:31.470 --> 08:33.637
A fun-loving buffer.
A fluffer.

08:33.764 --> 08:35.138
Wait, not that. Not a fluffer.

08:35.265 --> 08:36.890
Okay.
I-I won't be gone for long.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.225
These are ready. Ooh, teddy.

08:38.352 --> 08:39.893
-I don't think that's working.
-I know! I know!

08:40.020 --> 08:41.520
It's so easy for you, bob!

08:41.605 --> 08:43.104
With your charming,
lovable face!

08:43.232 --> 08:45.106
I hate you! Sorry, sorry.

08:45.234 --> 08:46.399
-[phone rings]
-hello?

08:46.443 --> 08:47.943
[bob]
<i>hey, dad. Uh, I was just calling</i>

08:48.070 --> 08:50.195
<i> To see how it's going.</i>
<i> Uh, with the kids?</i>

08:50.322 --> 08:51.988
Huh? Oh, it's, uh... Good.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.240
<i> -Great. That's great.</i>
-Uh-huh.

08:53.325 --> 08:54.866
<i> Hey, uh, I was just thinking</i>

08:54.952 --> 08:56.743
<i> How much more fun</i>
<i> it would be if I...</i>

08:56.870 --> 08:58.954
<i> Came down there</i>
<i> and we all hung out.</i>

08:59.081 --> 09:00.247
Oh. Really?

09:00.332 --> 09:01.248
<i> Yeah, I just thought</i>
<i> it'd be nice</i>

09:01.333 --> 09:03.083
<i>To all be at the wharf together.</i>

09:03.168 --> 09:06.878
Also, I'm here,
so I'll hang up now.

09:06.964 --> 09:08.171
Uh, where are the kids?

09:08.298 --> 09:10.632
Did you say something
that might have made them

09:10.717 --> 09:12.509
-Not want to be around you?
-What? No.

09:12.636 --> 09:13.969
I-I gave 'em each five bucks

09:14.096 --> 09:15.929
And told 'em to meet me
back here in 30 minutes.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.014
-Wait, what did you think I did?
-Nothing. Nothing.

09:18.141 --> 09:20.725
-So, I guess we should just
wait for them here?
-So, should we go look for them?

09:20.811 --> 09:21.643
-Oh.
-Okay.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.687
-All right. Oh.
-Oh, oh.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.564
Hey, let's go look for the kids.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.899
Yeah, I-I'm up,
so I might as well stay up.

09:27.985 --> 09:30.193
Great. Oh. Yep.

09:30.312 --> 09:32.279
[gene]
<i> hey, people. Don't be afraid.</i>

09:32.322 --> 09:33.530
<i> I'm not so different than you.</i>

09:33.699 --> 09:35.699
Okay, guys, for real,
we should leave now--

09:35.784 --> 09:37.242
Uh, hello.

09:37.327 --> 09:39.494
Fellas, fellas, fellas.
What's the rush?

09:39.621 --> 09:40.745
Hey, how's it going?

09:40.831 --> 09:42.247
Pretty crazy weather
we're having.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.832
What's your name, muscles?

09:43.959 --> 09:45.959
What are you,
on the swim team or something?

09:46.712 --> 09:49.170
So, uh, you came down here

09:49.298 --> 09:51.423
On the day I'm taking care
of the kids.

09:51.550 --> 09:52.882
Do you not trust me with them?

09:52.926 --> 09:54.301
What? No, I, uh--

09:54.386 --> 09:56.761
I mean, sure, I have no idea
where they are right now.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.430
-Right.
-But they're close. I think.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.307
-So I'm doing pretty good.
-Mm-hmm.

10:00.434 --> 10:01.766
Hey, you get that article
I sent you

10:01.893 --> 10:03.893
About the island
of garbage in the pacific?

10:03.979 --> 10:06.104
Yes. I, uh,
I-I definitely read it.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.606
All this stuff's
gonna end up there.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.899
Just a giant island of stuffed
animals and plastic--

10:10.068 --> 10:11.943
Ooh! We should win
that gorilla for the kids!

10:12.070 --> 10:13.028
Wait, what?

10:13.113 --> 10:14.279
I can't believe you won that.

10:14.323 --> 10:16.114
I guess I'm good
at aiming water at stuff.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.449
Except in the bathroom.
Sometimes.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.242
-I'm working on it.
-We all are.

10:19.328 --> 10:21.786
Your kids are gonna love this.
If we ever find them.

10:21.872 --> 10:22.829
Dibs on it if we don't.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.080
Well, w-we're back at the bench,

10:24.124 --> 10:25.373
And they're not here.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.293
Maybe we could see where
they are from up there?

10:28.378 --> 10:29.669
[big bob]
are the seats dry?

10:29.755 --> 10:31.004
They will be
after you sit there.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.048
We could wipe the seat
with the gorilla.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.466
-How dare you?
-Here.

10:34.551 --> 10:37.302
I, uh, got a high-quality,
totally hygienic rag.

10:37.429 --> 10:38.136
Great. Great.

10:38.263 --> 10:39.929
Wipe, wipe, wipe. All set.

10:40.057 --> 10:40.972
Hop on, gentlemen.

10:41.058 --> 10:43.224
It's just as wet. But okay.

10:43.352 --> 10:45.310
Well, we've told some fortunes,

10:45.395 --> 10:47.562
We've sung some songs,
we've used naughty words.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.064
Our work might be done here.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.148
Yeah, I'd like
to not get caught,

10:50.233 --> 10:51.650
So please, yes, can we go?

10:51.735 --> 10:52.734
Guess it is getting late,

10:52.986 --> 10:54.527
And I think we've
changed some lives today.

10:54.613 --> 10:56.738
Yeah, we told that guy
to grow a ponytail.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.448
That's gonna open up
a whole new world for him.

10:58.617 --> 11:01.576
[grunts]
oh, it's jammed or something.

11:01.662 --> 11:04.663
What? Uh, maybe you got
to shove it. [grunts]

11:04.831 --> 11:05.830
What if I just--

11:05.957 --> 11:07.248
-[gene grunts]
-[louise] oh, my god.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.876
-We-we're locked in? How?
-We can't get out?

11:09.961 --> 11:12.704
Are we being punished? For
being helpful and delightful?

11:12.756 --> 11:14.172
Oh, we're gonna get in trouble!

11:14.257 --> 11:15.507
Grandpa's gonna get in trouble!

11:15.634 --> 11:17.634
That's extra trouble!
And I wasn't comfortable

11:17.761 --> 11:19.135
-With normal trouble.
-It's okay. It's okay.

11:19.262 --> 11:20.845
There's got to be
someone who can let us out.

11:20.931 --> 11:22.681
[panicked breaths]

11:22.766 --> 11:25.266
So, not a ton
of people out there.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.102
-Help!
-Help!
-Let us out of here!

11:27.229 --> 11:30.563
-[louise]<i> help us!</i>
-[gene]<i> help!</i>
-[tina]<i> aah!</i>

11:34.695 --> 11:36.194
[louise]
<i> help! We're locked in!</i>

11:36.238 --> 11:38.279
<i> We're kids!</i>
<i>We're adorable kids inside here!</i>

11:38.407 --> 11:40.740
<i> -This is real life!</i>
-[tina hyperventilates]

11:40.909 --> 11:42.283
Were the walls
always this close?

11:42.369 --> 11:44.452
-[panicked breaths]
-how did we not see this coming?

11:44.579 --> 11:46.204
We're supposed to be
able to see the future.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.872
We're clamstradamus, damn it!

11:47.999 --> 11:51.167
[louise]
<i> help! Hat guy, three kids</i>
<i> are locked in here.</i>

11:51.253 --> 11:52.752
[gene]
<i> wait, we're telling the truth.</i>

11:52.838 --> 11:54.379
<i> It's not just</i>
<i> hilarious high jinks.</i>

11:54.464 --> 11:56.005
<i> We apologize</i>
<i> for trying to get you</i>

11:56.133 --> 11:57.424
<i> To give us your ride tickets.</i>

11:57.509 --> 11:59.551
<i> We were carefree</i>
<i> and stupid then.</i>

11:59.678 --> 12:01.386
<i> Now we know life is fragile.</i>

12:01.471 --> 12:03.972
[tina]
<i> oh, teen boy. We sorta had</i>
<i> a connection, right?</i>

12:04.057 --> 12:06.349
I'm a teen, just like you.
Stuck in this booth.

12:06.435 --> 12:08.101
With my siblings.
Please let us out.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.478
<i> And then we can just see</i>
<i> where things between us go.</i>

12:10.564 --> 12:11.563
Stop saying weird stuff.

12:11.648 --> 12:12.772
[louise]
<i> wait, wait.</i>

12:12.858 --> 12:13.982
<i> Can you at least</i>
<i> find our grandpa</i>

12:14.067 --> 12:15.191
<i>And tell him that we're in here?</i>

12:15.235 --> 12:16.735
-Your grandpa?
<i> -Yes, please.</i>

12:16.820 --> 12:18.945
<i> Go look for an old white guy</i>
<i> and bring him here.</i>

12:19.072 --> 12:21.698
[gene]
<i>and maybe grab us, I don't know,</i>
<i> a corn dog or something?</i>

12:21.783 --> 12:24.033
<i> Our grandpa will pay you back.</i>
<i> He's good for it.</i>

12:24.077 --> 12:25.034
[groans] weird.

12:25.162 --> 12:28.705
[together]
<i> no!</i>

12:30.041 --> 12:31.332
I can't see them.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.168
I'm starting to get
a little worried.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.753
Maybe they have a place
to make announcements,

12:34.796 --> 12:37.172
Like at supermarkets,
for when kids are missing?

12:37.299 --> 12:40.091
No judgment on anyone
who was watching them.

12:40.218 --> 12:41.342
None taken. Mostly.

12:41.470 --> 12:42.844
Maybe I should call
the restaurant,

12:42.929 --> 12:43.970
See if the kids are there.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.930
[linda]
oh, how cool do you look?

12:46.057 --> 12:48.308
So personable and friendly. Yes.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.101
My goggles are kind of
fogging up.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.186
Can you see my eyes?

12:51.271 --> 12:52.395
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:52.481 --> 12:53.897
Just the right amount
of your eyes.

12:54.065 --> 12:55.023
Okay, so what should I do?

12:55.108 --> 12:56.733
Maybe we go away
from the hammer.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.902
What's the, uh,
friendliest tool you got?

12:58.987 --> 13:00.153
I don't know. Maybe a wrench?

13:00.280 --> 13:02.155
Ooh, yes, yes.
A nice friendly wrench.

13:02.273 --> 13:03.406
-Pick out a cute one.
-[phone rings]

13:03.533 --> 13:05.325
Oop, hold on. Hey, bob.
How's the wharf?

13:05.494 --> 13:07.243
Hey, lin, uh,
are the kids there?

13:07.329 --> 13:08.745
No, why would they be here?

13:08.830 --> 13:11.039
Uh, well, I'm with
my dad, but, uh...

13:11.082 --> 13:12.999
We just don't have
the kids at the moment.

13:13.084 --> 13:14.542
So I-I was just checking.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.336
-Okay.
-But we'll find them.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.130
We lose 'em and then
we find 'em. That's our thing.

13:19.216 --> 13:20.256
I-I'll call you back.

13:20.342 --> 13:22.383
Uh, or call me
if they show up there.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.344
Okay. Wait.
Bob, what do you think

13:24.471 --> 13:25.428
The friendliest tool is?

13:25.514 --> 13:27.013
-[bob]<i> uh...</i>
-How about this one?

13:27.140 --> 13:28.264
No, no. Cuter.
Do you have cuter?

13:28.350 --> 13:29.682
Maybe. I don't know.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.810
-What do you think
about a tape measure?
-Yeah, yeah.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.394
[whispering] teddy is terrible
at getting his picture taken.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.313
-[bob]<i> what?</i>
-Nothing. Bye. Oh, god.

13:35.398 --> 13:36.773
How do you make
a tape measure look scary?

13:36.900 --> 13:38.233
Uh, plyers?

13:38.360 --> 13:39.108
-Aah!
-Ah!

13:39.194 --> 13:40.568
Geez, what if a shark

13:40.654 --> 13:42.403
Jumped out of the ocean
and grabbed all three of 'em?

13:42.489 --> 13:44.489
There's more sharks in these
waters every year, you know.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.908
Sharks are having a heyday,
and they're coming for us.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.243
Dad, when have sharks ever j--

13:48.328 --> 13:50.495
[sighs] you know,
I-I've been meaning to

13:50.664 --> 13:51.913
Talk to you about something.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.957
Again, not a criticism
exactly, but--

13:54.042 --> 13:55.875
Okay, I hate this already.

13:55.961 --> 13:57.001
Uh, n-never mind.

13:57.087 --> 13:59.212
Uh, uh, maybe
we should, uh, split up.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.005
W-we can cover
more ground that way.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.632
And then we can text
if we find 'em.

14:02.717 --> 14:05.426
Okay, fine. But tutu gorilla
is coming with me.

14:05.554 --> 14:06.344
It likes me better.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.137
I mean, it hasn't had a chance

14:08.223 --> 14:09.389
To get to know me, but fine.

14:09.474 --> 14:12.767
-Hey, how's the burger?
-Very good, thank you.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.435
Great. Let me ask you something.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.479
Would you hire this guy
to do handyman work

14:16.565 --> 14:18.147
-Around your house?
-Oh, my. No.

14:18.275 --> 14:20.191
I live alone. I wouldn't
have him in the house.

14:20.277 --> 14:21.818
-[teddy groans]
-uh, what about this one?

14:21.945 --> 14:24.195
-Would you hire him now?
-No. Mm-mm. Never.

14:24.322 --> 14:26.155
No-- you could--
he has done bad, bad things.

14:26.241 --> 14:28.274
-You can tell.
-[groans] linda, I told you!

14:28.326 --> 14:30.034
I can't do it.
It can't be done.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.578
Oh, god, you're right here.
Sorry.

14:31.663 --> 14:34.455
You look less scary in person.
A little less.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.875
I'll just go
into another line of work.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.084
I'll be a telemarketer.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.578
-Mmm, with that voice, though?
-Gah! Oh!

14:40.630 --> 14:42.338
Teddy! Teddy, teddy, teddy.

14:42.424 --> 14:44.090
Let me just make you
a burger, okay?

14:44.217 --> 14:45.466
We'll figure this out.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.634
Maybe don't leave me alone
with him?

14:46.720 --> 14:48.303
Actually, it's fine.
He-he's fine, right?

14:48.388 --> 14:50.346
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-I'm a gentle person!

14:50.432 --> 14:53.391
It's the pictures!
It's the pictures!

14:54.060 --> 14:55.226
Where are you kids?

14:55.312 --> 14:57.270
Sharks can't jump out
to get us--

14:57.397 --> 14:58.229
[screams] oh.

14:58.315 --> 14:59.606
[tina]
<i> do we live here now?</i>

14:59.691 --> 15:02.066
I don't know if
I totally like the layout.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.818
Uh, yeah, there's no tv.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.778
And the toilet leaves
something to be desired,

15:05.864 --> 15:06.946
'cause it's the floor.

15:07.032 --> 15:08.656
-Oh, my god! It's dad!
-What?
-Dad?

15:08.783 --> 15:10.783
[louise]
he's walking away. Dad! Dad!

15:10.869 --> 15:12.410
What if dad
freaked the kids out?

15:12.495 --> 15:14.412
Freaked them out
and they ran away?

15:14.581 --> 15:17.165
-'cause they're scared
of the ice caps melting?
-[kids yelling]

15:17.334 --> 15:18.875
-Hmm?
-Coming through.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.336
[screeching]

15:21.421 --> 15:22.670
Nobody died.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.005
-We'll come back for that.
-Okay.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.174
[kids yelling]

15:26.259 --> 15:28.259
-Dad, dad!
-Dad!

15:28.386 --> 15:29.844
[all yelling]

15:29.930 --> 15:31.554
[gene]
<i> well, let's think</i>
<i> about sleeping arrangements</i>

15:31.681 --> 15:33.014
<i> Because we are stuck</i>
<i> in here for the night.</i>

15:33.099 --> 15:34.557
<i> I call this side.</i>

15:34.643 --> 15:35.683
-[louise]<i> I call this side.</i>
-[tina]<i> damn it.</i>

15:40.065 --> 15:42.732
Help. Somebody. Anybody. Please.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.109
-Okay, kind of
emptying out here.
<i> -Help. Help.</i>

15:45.195 --> 15:46.819
-Kids not anywhere in sight.
<i> -Help.</i>

15:46.905 --> 15:48.780
<i> -Help. Help.</i>
-Feeling fine about that.
Totally fine.

15:48.865 --> 15:51.616
<i> Help. Help. Help.</i>

15:51.701 --> 15:54.035
<i> Help us. Please help us.</i>

15:54.120 --> 15:55.787
I don't quite get it.

15:55.872 --> 15:58.623
Dad's never gonna find us.
No one's ever gonna find us.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.458
[gene]
<i> we're gonna have</i>
<i> to marry each other.</i>

16:00.543 --> 16:03.086
<i> -It'll be a small ceremony.</i>
-[tina]<i> but tasteful.</i>

16:03.213 --> 16:04.837
Wait, kids? Are you in there?

16:04.965 --> 16:06.381
Dad! Yes!
We're in here!

16:06.466 --> 16:08.549
<i> We're talking through</i>
<i>a microphone in a little booth.</i>

16:08.635 --> 16:10.176
<i> We're locked in. Hurry!</i>

16:10.303 --> 16:13.054
<i> Hurry, it's filling up with</i>
<i> tina breath and gene farts.</i>

16:13.139 --> 16:14.389
[tina]
<i>how did you know we needed you?</i>

16:14.474 --> 16:16.015
<i> Could you smell us</i>
<i> from the restaurant?</i>

16:16.101 --> 16:17.976
I-I didn't.
I-I came for another reason.

16:18.061 --> 16:19.185
But where's the booth?

16:19.312 --> 16:20.603
I-I don't understand
where you are.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.271
[gene]
to your left!
I mean, your right.

16:22.357 --> 16:23.982
Sorry, I was never good at that.

16:24.109 --> 16:25.733
-But I have other qualities.
-Are you in here?

16:25.819 --> 16:28.319
There's those beautiful,
sad, tired eyes.

16:28.405 --> 16:29.779
-Yes! Yes! In here!
-The door's over here,

16:29.864 --> 16:31.781
But it's jammed or blocked
or something.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.866
Okay, I'm coming.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.119
[grunts] I can't open it.

16:36.204 --> 16:37.704
H-how did this happen?

16:37.831 --> 16:39.247
[louise]
it was fated in the stars?

16:39.332 --> 16:41.082
And also the booth was empty
and we went in

16:41.209 --> 16:42.417
And someone must have
locked us in here.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.544
Ugh, I can't see
any wonder wharf people.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.129
I guess I'll go get somebody?

16:46.214 --> 16:47.547
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, father.

16:47.632 --> 16:50.216
I'm just now realizing
that it might not be

16:50.343 --> 16:52.260
Good for the staff here
to know about the whole

16:52.387 --> 16:54.178
"us messing around
with the clam" thing.

16:54.264 --> 16:56.180
We don't want to be
on the no-ride list.

16:56.266 --> 16:57.515
I've heard it's very hard
to get off.

16:57.642 --> 16:59.809
Unless you know someone
in the state department.

16:59.894 --> 17:02.186
Yeah, w-we'll just have
to deal with that.

17:02.313 --> 17:03.396
Geez, there is a gap here.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.023
Maybe if I could wedge
something in,

17:05.108 --> 17:07.025
I might be able to free the bolt

17:07.110 --> 17:08.693
And it wouldn't even be broken?

17:08.820 --> 17:09.944
Oh!

17:09.988 --> 17:11.904
[panting]

17:11.948 --> 17:13.156
Yep. Yep.

17:13.324 --> 17:14.699
This fell off a ride.

17:14.784 --> 17:17.410
Uh, I'm gonna see if I can
wedge it into the doorjamb.

17:17.537 --> 17:18.578
Also, I don't think
we should let you...

17:18.663 --> 17:20.955
[grunting]
ride the rides here anymore.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.207
This place is falling apart.

17:23.334 --> 17:26.586
Cheer up, teddy.
Who needs pictures and websites?

17:26.713 --> 17:29.047
I don't think the internet's
gonna last that long anyway.

17:29.132 --> 17:31.799
Yeah, I guess. Maybe.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.384
Mmm! Oh, that's good.

17:33.470 --> 17:34.677
[gasps] stop!

17:34.763 --> 17:36.304
-What?
-I-I mean, don't stop.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.056
Take another bite.
I-I mean, chew first

17:38.141 --> 17:39.057
And then take another bite.

17:39.142 --> 17:40.391
Mm. What? Like this?

17:40.477 --> 17:41.851
-[camera clicks]
-[linda] that's it.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.269
Your face. Look at your face.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.021
Oh, yeah.
I look kind of... Happy?

17:45.148 --> 17:47.190
[linda]
yeah, you look normal and happy.

17:47.317 --> 17:48.608
[teddy]
it's the burger.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.069
The food here takes
the murder out of people's eyes.

17:51.196 --> 17:52.612
There's your handy
profile picture.

17:52.697 --> 17:54.739
Do you think it's okay
that I'm not fixing anything

17:54.824 --> 17:56.449
-And I'm eating?
-Oh, yeah. Oh!

17:56.534 --> 17:58.576
Get your tools and then take
a bite and hammer something.

17:58.703 --> 18:01.162
-Okay.
-I bet cindy crawford
did the same thing,

18:01.247 --> 18:02.747
Kept a burger right next to her.

18:02.832 --> 18:04.207
That probably
wasn't even a mole.

18:04.334 --> 18:05.500
Just a little bit of burger.

18:05.627 --> 18:07.752
Almost got it...
[straining]

18:07.879 --> 18:10.755
[tina]
not worried that you've
been saying that for so long.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.673
-Hell yeah!
-Yes!
-Freedom!

18:12.801 --> 18:14.425
I did it! [laughs]

18:14.460 --> 18:16.177
-I'm strong.
-Sure, you are.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.512
So why did you come here, dad?

18:17.639 --> 18:19.180
Didn't trust us with grandpa?

18:19.307 --> 18:21.140
Thought we'd take his pills
and push him into the ocean?

18:21.226 --> 18:24.227
No, it's not you with him,
it's him with you.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.270
Oh, no, he's a good grandpa.
This wasn't his fault.

18:26.356 --> 18:27.772
It's our fault.
I-I mean, some of us said

18:27.857 --> 18:30.525
"let's not do this" and other
people weren't receptive.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.485
Dad, seriously,
what were you worried about?

18:32.612 --> 18:34.529
You were acting weird
in the restaurant earlier,

18:34.614 --> 18:36.447
But I just figured it was
a new thing you were trying.

18:36.574 --> 18:40.243
It's just sometimes pop pop
can be a-a little dark?

18:40.328 --> 18:43.037
About life?
And kinda negative?

18:43.164 --> 18:44.205
-You mean like you?
-What?

18:44.332 --> 18:45.623
Yeah, mr. Everything's bad
all the time?

18:45.708 --> 18:49.127
"I'm tired. I'm worried.
My back hurts. I'm bob."

18:49.212 --> 18:50.795
-Whoa, that's pretty good.
-Thank you.

18:50.880 --> 18:51.879
What? No. That's not...

18:52.006 --> 18:54.173
That doesn't sound like me.
That much.

18:54.259 --> 18:56.300
-There's pop pop now.
-[chuckles]

18:56.386 --> 18:57.927
Should we clamstradamus him?

18:58.012 --> 18:59.178
It's invigorating, you'll see.

18:59.264 --> 19:00.263
-[tina] um, what?
-[bob] no.

19:00.348 --> 19:01.722
Also, I just got you out
of there.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.307
[gene]
I missed it a little.

19:03.393 --> 19:05.226
Hey, you. Cool guy
with that beautiful gorilla.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.270
Huh? What? Oh, you again.

19:07.355 --> 19:08.813
Listen, I don't know
how this works,

19:08.898 --> 19:11.357
But did you see three kids?
'cause I'm looking for 'em.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.817
[louise]
<i> wow, they sound amazing.</i>

19:12.902 --> 19:14.110
<i> Do you want to talk</i>
<i> about which one</i>

19:14.195 --> 19:15.862
<i>You like the best and which one</i>

19:15.989 --> 19:17.113
<i> You could do without, frankly?</i>

19:17.240 --> 19:18.656
All right. Thank you. Goodbye.

19:18.783 --> 19:20.324
<i> Wait, let us tell you</i>
<i> your future.</i>

19:20.410 --> 19:22.577
<i> You're gonna live</i>
<i> for 1,000 years.</i>

19:22.662 --> 19:25.580
Pfft. The world won't even be
around in a thousand years.

19:25.707 --> 19:28.374
[gene]
<i> 'cause it will have moved</i>
<i> to a funner location, or...?</i>

19:28.418 --> 19:29.542
No, because it's all
going to h--

19:29.627 --> 19:31.043
[bob]
<i> okay, that's it.</i>

19:31.129 --> 19:32.295
<i> You know, I've been</i>
<i> trying to say this to you,</i>

19:32.338 --> 19:33.629
<i> And I'm just gonna say it.</i>

19:33.756 --> 19:35.381
<i> -As a talking clam.</i>
-[louise]<i> clamstradamus.</i>

19:35.466 --> 19:36.674
<i> Dr. Clamstradamus.</i>

[bob]<i> if you keep saying</i>
<i> stuff like that</i>

19:38.428 --> 19:40.428
<i> Around your grandkids,</i>

19:40.555 --> 19:42.054
<i> And then it might</i>
<i> actually come true.</i>

19:42.140 --> 19:44.557

Well, for your information,

Well, whatever your name is.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.441
[bob]
<i> clamstradamus.</i>
<i> It says it right there.</i>

19:53.526 --> 19:55.568
I'm not always worried
about the future.

19:55.695 --> 19:56.611
<i> Oh, really?</i>

19:56.779 --> 19:58.529
Yeah. And that's
because of my grandkids.

19:58.573 --> 20:00.156
They might actually
figure stuff out.

20:00.283 --> 20:01.532
And, you know, fix stuff.

20:01.618 --> 20:04.285
-Oh.
-Yeah, mr. Deep thoughts
on a rainy day.

20:04.403 --> 20:06.078
<i> I didn't know</i>
<i> you felt like that.</i>

20:06.206 --> 20:08.789
<i> Well, I-I'm glad we talked.</i>

20:08.875 --> 20:10.374
Do you mind if I go?

20:10.460 --> 20:13.628
<i> Oh, sure. But I've got</i>
<i> one last prediction:</i>

20:13.755 --> 20:16.088
<i> Uh, if you walk</i>
<i> towards the ferris wheel,</i>

20:16.216 --> 20:17.632
<i>Your family will meet you there.</i>

20:17.759 --> 20:19.050
Okay, goodbye.

20:19.177 --> 20:21.302
[gene]<i> and I predict,</i>
<i> if you buy five fried doughs,</i>

20:21.429 --> 20:23.387
They will be very appreciated.

20:23.514 --> 20:25.097
That might have been
the best conversation

20:25.183 --> 20:26.515
I've ever had with my dad.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.476
Let's come back here when
you want to tell us about sex.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.478
By the way, has pop pop
always walked around

20:30.563 --> 20:33.231
With a giant gorilla, or did he
win that for us today?

20:33.316 --> 20:34.815
-Oh yeah, he did.
-Whoo!

20:34.901 --> 20:35.942
Hey, you know what?

20:36.027 --> 20:37.526
Why don't you go
catch up to pop pop?

20:37.612 --> 20:39.904
Tell him I had to go back
to the restaurant, okay?

20:40.031 --> 20:41.280
-Which restaurant?
-Hmm.

20:41.366 --> 20:42.782
Enjoy the rest
of your afternoon together.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.618
-You know what I wish
we could get? Fried clams.
-I know.

20:45.703 --> 20:46.953
-Yeah.
-Oh, yeah. Me, too.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.287
Should we wait here
till they open in the morning?

20:48.414 --> 20:49.247
