00:06.048 --> 00:07.842
Who wants their balls crushed?

00:07.842 --> 00:09.176
Me.

00:13.097 --> 00:15.516
This isn't what it looks like.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.185
You're done. Grab your shit
and get the fuck out.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.353
The Boys is mine.

00:19.353 --> 00:22.481
<i>Says a dying man
with one last bluff.</i>

00:22.481 --> 00:23.858
The Seven is getting even stronger.

00:23.858 --> 00:26.193
Put your hands together for Firecracker.

00:27.611 --> 00:30.448
What have I done to make you
hate me so much?

00:30.448 --> 00:33.284
You really don't remember me, do you?

00:33.284 --> 00:34.285
And Sister Sage!

00:36.620 --> 00:38.080
Fascist!

00:38.080 --> 00:40.249
<i>She's the world's
smartest person.</i>

00:40.249 --> 00:42.334
- Uh-huh.

00:42.334 --> 00:44.378
You remember Colin Hauser?

00:44.378 --> 00:48.382
<i>So, what happens when he finds out
you murdered his family?</i>

00:49.258 --> 00:50.843
My dad, he had a stroke.

00:50.843 --> 00:54.388
- I'm really sorry. Really.
- Mom?

00:54.388 --> 00:57.349
I want to flip A-Train.
He's right there, he's ready.

00:57.349 --> 00:58.976
Enough!

00:58.976 --> 01:00.311
<i>You're never gonna be
your true self</i>

01:00.311 --> 01:03.063
<i>until you transcend your humanity.</i>

01:03.063 --> 01:05.566
You need to go back to the start.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.568
<i>You need to go home.</i>

01:22.666 --> 01:25.211
Hey, Marty.

01:25.211 --> 01:26.545
The security cameras upstairs
just went black.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.672
Hey, Phil, you copy?

01:28.672 --> 01:32.259
Phil? Anyone up there?

01:34.512 --> 01:37.014
Call Vought, tell them we have a breach.

01:38.516 --> 01:39.892
The line's dead.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.848
Hello, everyone.

02:18.848 --> 02:20.224
Hi.

02:20.224 --> 02:21.684
John.
- Homelander.

02:23.102 --> 02:26.105
Just Homelander.

02:26.105 --> 02:28.190
Hey, Marty. Good to see you.

02:28.190 --> 02:31.652
You, too, uh, Homelander.

02:32.945 --> 02:37.324
Oh, my God, this is just so surreal.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.285
I never thought I'd be back here.

02:39.285 --> 02:42.288
So many memories.

02:42.288 --> 02:46.375
Oh, I, uh, I brought a Fudgie the Whale.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.669
Do me a favor, could you get
a plate and some forks?

02:48.669 --> 02:50.379
Thank you so much.

02:53.424 --> 02:56.302
I see some new faces.

02:56.302 --> 02:59.680
But a lot that I recognize. Frank.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.391
And-and Assistant Director now, Marty.

03:02.391 --> 03:06.228
I still remember when they had you
wiping out the stool sample containers.

03:06.228 --> 03:09.398
- You remember?

03:09.398 --> 03:11.859
Yeah.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.777
Oh...

03:13.777 --> 03:15.237
Where's Barbara?

03:15.237 --> 03:16.780
Last I checked, she's still Director?

03:16.780 --> 03:18.282
She's off-site today.

03:18.282 --> 03:20.868
Oh, bring her in, would you?
I'd love to catch up.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.996
Tell her-- Tell her it's a little reunion.

03:23.996 --> 03:26.832
Terrific. All right, everyone, dig in.

03:29.335 --> 03:31.170
Come on, don't be shy. Before it melts.

03:32.963 --> 03:35.549
Please. Come on in. There you go.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.960
What are you doing?

04:13.379 --> 04:16.215
Come on, get up.
Butcher, the world doesn't end

04:16.215 --> 04:18.217
just because your shitty life does.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.679
Get up.

04:23.514 --> 04:25.265
Get up.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.066
<i>Are you fucking kidding me?!</i>

04:34.066 --> 04:37.486
I'm sorry, your father's condition
meets the criteria for brain death.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.947
It might not seem like it,
but it is the most humane thing.

04:39.947 --> 04:43.325
Humane? You're pulling his feeding tubes
so he starves to death, right?

04:43.325 --> 04:45.327
Hughie, it's what he wanted.

04:50.833 --> 04:53.002
How long before, um...

04:53.002 --> 04:54.545
A couple of days at most.

04:56.797 --> 05:00.009
Mom. Don't.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.555
I'm sorry.

05:26.869 --> 05:28.912
Hughie...

05:28.912 --> 05:30.581
<i>V52 Expo.</i>

05:30.581 --> 05:32.499
<i>Come meet The Seven in person,</i>

<i>A deranged fascist hellbent

05:54.521 --> 05:56.690
You should hear
what they say about me.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.987
Give us the room.

06:07.659 --> 06:11.080
Miss January, the only thing
I really want to hear is

06:11.080 --> 06:13.540
"We found a way to kill
the head-popping bitch."

06:13.540 --> 06:14.917
Mm-mm.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.376
Then this will be a quick meeting.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.045
You need my help, sir.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.047
I read the draft of your
Supe-control bill.

06:20.047 --> 06:24.510
Let me guess, it's perfect,
but you know just how to fix it.

06:24.510 --> 06:27.221
If you get it passed, that's a stake
through Vought's heart.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.556
Gets 'em out of the military, policing,

06:29.556 --> 06:33.227
tanks their stock, buries 'em in lawsuits.

06:33.227 --> 06:36.146
See, it sure sounds like
I don't need your help.

06:36.146 --> 06:37.898
But that's if you get it passed.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.442
You need-- what?--
50 million constituents

06:40.442 --> 06:42.903
demanding Congress get off its ass?

06:42.903 --> 06:46.198
No offense, but your PR department
is kind of shitting the bed.

06:46.198 --> 06:48.951
I just okayed a huge marketing spend.

06:48.951 --> 06:53.455
Yeah, your ad-buys during <i>CSI: Las Vegas</i>
are definitely winning over

06:53.455 --> 06:56.500
the "left the TV on
'cause they're dead" demo.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.841
So, what is your suggestion?

07:03.841 --> 07:07.261
I can get people into the streets
all over the country,

07:07.261 --> 07:08.762
and they'll demand that
the bill gets passed.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.348
- You'll do it as Starlight?
- Yes.

07:11.348 --> 07:16.103
I'll even make another fucking...
Supersuit if I have to.

07:16.103 --> 07:19.106
And what do you get for this?

07:19.106 --> 07:20.607
Just a promise.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.985
Promise me you'll finish what you started.

07:22.985 --> 07:27.281
Once and for all...
we put Vought into the ground.

07:43.005 --> 07:46.341
Colin, what is this?

07:46.341 --> 07:48.385
Oh, who's uncultured now?

07:52.014 --> 07:54.933
Ray Charles, his country western phase.

07:56.268 --> 07:58.770
My dad used to play this
all the time in the car,

07:58.770 --> 08:01.273
and I'd fall asleep to it in the backseat.

08:01.273 --> 08:05.235
You never told me about them.

08:06.570 --> 08:08.113
Your family.

08:08.113 --> 08:11.033
It's, uh...

08:11.033 --> 08:12.743
not exactly my favorite story to tell.

08:12.743 --> 08:15.329
No. <i>Désolé.</i>

08:15.329 --> 08:17.331
No, it's fine.

08:17.331 --> 08:20.751
When my mom wasn't on my ass
for my grades,

08:20.751 --> 08:22.502
she was a federal judge.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.796
She dealt with really violent cases,

08:24.796 --> 08:26.131
like, the worst of the worst.

08:26.131 --> 08:29.927
And there was this Russian mafia thing
in Brighton Beach.

08:29.927 --> 08:32.179
Their boss was this woman.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.057
My mom was gonna make
an example out of her.

08:35.057 --> 08:37.351
So they made an example out of my mom.

08:39.728 --> 08:43.982
Some guy broke in,
and they found my parents first.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.859
Then my little sister.

08:47.653 --> 08:48.987
You were there?

08:48.987 --> 08:50.906
The gunshots woke me up.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.367
<i>I heard 'em coming down the hallway,</i>

08:53.367 --> 08:54.493

<i>All I saw was his ankle.</i>

08:58.247 --> 09:01.667
<i>He had these scars, or these burns maybe.</i>

09:03.418 --> 09:07.673
Ugh, a lot of nightmares about those.

09:07.673 --> 09:09.758
I'm sorry.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.914
Hey, guys, let's call in Stacey and Mark.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.458
We need to get an announcement ready.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.880
What?

09:53.010 --> 09:54.678
What are they doing?

10:05.647 --> 10:07.149
That bitch.

10:07.149 --> 10:11.194
VNN is handling the launch
of Firecracker's show,

10:11.194 --> 10:13.613
simulcast across all Vought networks.

10:13.613 --> 10:17.159
The troll farms are already digging up
fringe anti-Starlight content

10:17.159 --> 10:19.119
and injecting it into the mainstream.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.413
So far, "Starlight's Progressive Jihad"

10:21.413 --> 10:24.541
and "#ArrogantWhiteFeminism"
are showing promise.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.752
We need the algorithm to find
the most receptive users,

10:26.752 --> 10:29.921
then blast the articles to the top
of their social feeds

10:29.921 --> 10:32.883
until 100 million people
are outraged by Starlight

10:32.883 --> 10:34.426
for reasons they can't even explain.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.053
Dope.

10:43.935 --> 10:46.188
Heroes, you have your talking points,

10:46.188 --> 10:48.732
so, everyone, get to it.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.902
- Hey, can we talk?
- No.

10:51.902 --> 10:56.031
Hey. So, I was thinking over lunch
we could order some of those

10:56.031 --> 10:57.699
fried pickles from Flavortown,

10:57.699 --> 10:59.910
or just skip straight to
the flounder pounder special.

10:59.910 --> 11:04.122
I find you repulsive in a way
that's difficult to quantify.

11:04.122 --> 11:07.584
And I'm fucking amazing
at quantifying, so...

11:12.214 --> 11:15.342
So, big day. You ready?

11:15.342 --> 11:17.219
You have no idea.

11:17.219 --> 11:19.888
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.098
One last piece of the puzzle.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.851
Figured this could be your big finish.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.567
You know, when I first met you,

11:32.567 --> 11:33.777
I thought you were kind of uppity,

11:33.777 --> 11:36.571
but you're one of the good ones.

11:36.571 --> 11:40.742
Well, we are the new kids in The Seven.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.202
Mm-hmm.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.412
Gotta look out for each other.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.842
Hello, Patriots!

11:59.302 --> 12:03.306
Now, I know a lot of you probably know me
from my podcast,

12:03.306 --> 12:06.476
<i>but VNN gave me the next six hours</i>

12:06.476 --> 12:09.855
<i>to bring you the truth about Starlight</i>

12:09.855 --> 12:11.940
<i>and her house of horrors.</i>

12:11.940 --> 12:14.609
<i>- Where dozens of trafficked children...</i>
- Here, grab your bags and come with me.

12:14.609 --> 12:16.069
- Sweetheart, don't forget this.
Here you go.
- Okay.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.488
- We'll sneak the kids out
through the back.
- Okay.

12:18.488 --> 12:19.906
- Are you sure about this?
Yeah.

12:19.906 --> 12:23.535
Just please tell Sasha to have them
go easy on the room service, okay?

12:23.535 --> 12:25.036
That card is almost maxed out.

12:25.036 --> 12:26.705
- You got it.
- Thank you.

12:26.705 --> 12:29.332
Now...

12:29.332 --> 12:32.502
Firecracker's celebrity friends
are arriving.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.254
- I saw Jon Voight.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.801
What the fuck is he doing here?

12:40.886 --> 12:43.638
Bringing him back in.

12:43.638 --> 12:44.848
No. No, no, no, no, no. I don't trust him.

12:44.848 --> 12:48.477
I don't. And you're insane
if you do, okay?

12:48.477 --> 12:50.812
And you can drink yourself to death

12:50.812 --> 12:52.731
in whatever dark hole you crawled out of.

12:52.731 --> 12:55.108
That's a good idea. I might just do that.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.568
- Good.
- Okay, wait a minute.

12:56.568 --> 12:59.946
Hold on a second, Butcher.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.199
Look, Lord knows I got problems
with the guy, too

13:02.199 --> 13:04.451
We both do, but this is bigger than us.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.161
That shit Homelander and Sage
are talking about,

13:06.161 --> 13:07.829
that's some end-of-time shit.

13:07.829 --> 13:11.124
Team is shy one total asshole.
Now, we need this motherfucker.

13:11.124 --> 13:15.045
- I mean, I'm...
- Annie, this is my call. It's done.

13:23.845 --> 13:26.973
Well, all right then.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.975
Happy we got that sorted, eh?

13:28.975 --> 13:31.436
Now, can someone please explain to me

13:31.436 --> 13:35.899
what makes you Firecracker's Moby Cunt?

13:35.899 --> 13:38.276
- I have no idea.
- Bollocks.

13:39.361 --> 13:40.570
I don't.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.698
Now, what's our next move?

13:43.698 --> 13:46.952
You get me 50K from the Company,
and in three hours

13:46.952 --> 13:50.038
I'll have all the dirt we need
on Little Miss Guns and Ammo.

13:50.038 --> 13:53.124
Butcher, there's no way
I'm letting you out of my sight

13:53.124 --> 13:55.919
- with 50 grand.
- All right.

13:55.919 --> 13:59.589
But I'm warning you,
you ain't gonna like it.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.223
<i>And Kanye West!</i>

14:09.307 --> 14:12.477
<i>But first, a sermon by Ezekiel,</i>

14:12.477 --> 14:15.981
<i>Starlight's childhood pastor
before she fell from God's grace.</i>

14:17.190 --> 14:19.651
<i>We'll be right back with that, y'all.
You stick around.</i>

14:19.651 --> 14:21.736
<i>U.S.A.!</i>

14:25.699 --> 14:28.785
Hey, Frank, come on over.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.790
How about a game of wastepaper basketball?

14:33.790 --> 14:35.500
I'm sorry?

14:36.793 --> 14:39.838
Uh, first of three, and tell you what,

14:39.838 --> 14:41.298
make it interesting,

14:41.298 --> 14:44.801
you win, I'll let you knock off early,
go see the fam.

14:44.801 --> 14:48.388
- Um, okay.
- Excellent.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.348
I'll start.

15:01.943 --> 15:05.155
You know, I learned this game
from you, Frank.

15:05.155 --> 15:07.991
I don't understand.

15:07.991 --> 15:11.995
I once saw you take a shot
at a waste basket, and you nailed it,

15:11.995 --> 15:15.582
and... and you don't remember.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.000
No.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.003
Yeah, well, I sure do.

15:20.003 --> 15:22.172
Yeah, you were sitting there,

15:22.172 --> 15:26.301
and, well, I was in this oven here.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.428
And you made the shot.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.639
You did a little fist pump to celebrate,

15:30.639 --> 15:32.182
and then you turned up the temperature

15:32.182 --> 15:34.017
to see if you could burn my skin.

15:34.017 --> 15:36.853
- You remember that, right?

15:36.853 --> 15:38.521
Your turn.

15:43.693 --> 15:47.030
Fun fact. Um, even though
my skin didn't char,

15:47.030 --> 15:49.240
it still really hurt.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.535
I mean a lot.

15:54.287 --> 15:57.415
Yeah, I was in there, screaming in agony,

15:57.415 --> 16:01.461
and my tears just sizzled away.

16:02.045 --> 16:02.879
Yeah.

16:06.007 --> 16:09.219
I remember there was, uh,
people standing here

16:09.219 --> 16:11.513
taking notes, but behind them

16:11.513 --> 16:14.224
I saw you make that shot.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.936
It really was a great shot, Frank.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.521
I was just doing my job.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.905
Hmm.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.157
You know, I had nightmares about
that exact moment,

16:31.157 --> 16:34.244
and you can't even remember it.

16:34.577 --> 16:39.541
It's funny, isn't it, how people can have
such a different memory

16:39.541 --> 16:42.585
of the exact same thing.

16:44.295 --> 16:47.507
It's all a matter of perspective, I guess.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.097
Hey, Frank?

16:54.097 --> 16:55.932
This is my last shot.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.434
Why don't you go watch from in there?

16:57.434 --> 17:00.478
- John, why don't we--
-"Homelander."

17:03.648 --> 17:06.526
- Get in the oven, Frank.
Please.

17:11.865 --> 17:14.659
Get in the oven
or your family goes in with you.

17:14.659 --> 17:15.785
Please, Homelander,

17:15.785 --> 17:17.162
- you don't have to do this.
- Marty.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.964
Thank you.

17:30.467 --> 17:31.676
I'm sorry.

17:33.094 --> 17:35.263
I'm so, so sorry.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.474
You're sorry?

17:37.474 --> 17:38.808
Now?

17:40.810 --> 17:42.228
But why?

17:44.230 --> 17:46.232
You were just doing your job, right?

17:50.403 --> 17:52.822
Homelander...

17:52.822 --> 17:55.450
Don't do this! No.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.970
And I bet you would've won.

18:16.805 --> 18:17.806
Oh, my God.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.933
- Oh, my God.
- I forgive you.

18:44.290 --> 18:47.752
Uh, I don't know,
he should be here any minute.

18:47.752 --> 18:50.588
Thanks, by the way, for being my muscle.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.390
Yeah.

19:03.685 --> 19:04.853
What the shit is this?

19:04.853 --> 19:06.271
Where's the talking goatee
with the gold chains?

19:06.271 --> 19:07.647
It's okay.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.732
I'm the one that called you.

19:09.732 --> 19:11.317
Are you crazy?

19:11.317 --> 19:13.778
Sage is on my ass,
stares at me like I'm fucking dinner.

19:13.778 --> 19:16.322
But you thought this was
a good time to be seen together?

19:16.322 --> 19:18.992
I need a dose of Compound V,
and I need it today.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.201
Oh!

19:20.201 --> 19:22.120
Is that all? For what?

19:22.120 --> 19:24.497
- What do you care?
- Homelander has every vial of V

19:24.497 --> 19:26.082
locked up in his apartment.

19:26.082 --> 19:28.001
- Hundreds of them. Nobody gets it.
Okay.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.460
Well, he's not gonna miss one vial, then.

19:29.460 --> 19:30.670
- You got to find a way.
- No.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.463
It's too dangerous.

19:32.463 --> 19:33.882
No, hey. Fuck that!

19:33.882 --> 19:35.133
You owe me.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.926
I owe you?

19:36.926 --> 19:39.470
- I just saved your fucking life.
- Every single fucked up,

19:39.470 --> 19:42.181
horrible thing that's ever happened to me,
to all of us,

19:42.181 --> 19:45.393
it all started with you,
'cause you took away someone I loved.

19:46.394 --> 19:47.896
And now you're gonna
give someone I love back.

19:47.896 --> 19:49.480
What?

19:53.026 --> 19:55.612
My dad's about to die.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.866
V is the only thing that can save him.

20:02.327 --> 20:04.370
This is your chance...

20:06.456 --> 20:08.416
...to finally make things right.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.627
What makes you think I give a shit?

20:11.669 --> 20:13.421
You tell me.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.093
If I do this...

20:19.093 --> 20:21.137
we're good?

20:21.137 --> 20:22.555
Forever?

20:22.555 --> 20:23.765
Yes.

20:30.063 --> 20:32.565
Ow! What?

20:36.986 --> 20:38.321
Kimiko, I'm sorry, but it's my dad.

20:38.321 --> 20:40.615
What else was I supposed to do?

20:51.501 --> 20:53.169
Fuck!

20:59.133 --> 21:01.094
Who the fuck are those guys?

21:07.433 --> 21:09.227
No, I can't. I can't. My ankle.

21:09.227 --> 21:10.979
My--

21:10.979 --> 21:13.356
No, no, no. Oh, Jesus.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.532
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

21:24.409 --> 21:25.493
Who the fuck are those guys?

21:27.286 --> 21:29.205
Light. Shining Light? Like--

21:29.205 --> 21:30.289
Shining Light. Shining Light?

21:31.207 --> 21:32.208
Why are they after us?

21:37.296 --> 21:38.506
Fuck.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.925
Okay, what do we do?

21:44.345 --> 21:45.888
No, I-I can't run anywhere. I can't.

22:02.030 --> 22:03.031
No, no, no.

22:03.031 --> 22:04.574
Whoa.

22:04.574 --> 22:06.075
Easy. All right.

22:06.617 --> 22:09.162
Okay.

22:10.413 --> 22:11.289
I got it.

22:20.506 --> 22:24.969
<i>♪ Love lift us up where we belong ♪</i>

22:26.512 --> 22:29.932
<i>♪ Where the eagles cry ♪</i>

22:29.932 --> 22:32.393
<i>♪ On a mountain...</i>

22:47.533 --> 22:51.913
Not a word about that 50 grand and what
happened to it to Mallory, motherfucker.

22:51.913 --> 22:53.998
Straight up Webweaver's stinky spider?

22:53.998 --> 22:56.876
Heroin enemas don't come cheap, my son.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.836
I'll never unsee that nasty shit.

22:58.836 --> 23:01.714
Well, I fucking warned you, didn't I?

23:01.714 --> 23:03.424
Anyway, don't matter.

23:03.424 --> 23:06.469
- Got what we needed. Job done.
- Uh-huh.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.807
You ever gonna tell me what happened
with that gash on your face?

23:24.570 --> 23:26.656
M, I got a favor to ask.

23:26.656 --> 23:28.658
Think you're in a position
to ask for a favor?

23:29.784 --> 23:32.787
If I can't get the job done
before I, uh...

23:39.877 --> 23:42.380
I need you to get Ryan away
from Homelander.

23:42.380 --> 23:44.006
Oh, Butcher.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.678
I got to be realistic.

23:51.556 --> 23:53.599
Some days I can barely even fucking stand.

23:53.599 --> 23:56.352
- Get him out of there. Raise him.
- Raise him?

23:56.352 --> 23:58.896
You're the best dad I know, M.

23:58.896 --> 24:00.314
The best fucking anyone.

24:00.314 --> 24:03.067
That might be one of the nicest things
you've ever said to me, but...

24:03.067 --> 24:05.403
what if Ryan doesn't want to go?

24:08.239 --> 24:09.490
Then you've got to make him.

24:16.539 --> 24:18.374
White trash walking.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.211
Top-notch show, love.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.463
Just weren't sure
whether you wanted us to kneel

24:24.463 --> 24:26.132
before your cross or burn it.

24:27.675 --> 24:30.261
Oh, you're those motherfuckers
that killed my friend.

24:30.261 --> 24:32.722
Yeah, crying shame, that.

24:32.722 --> 24:36.809
But if it's any consolation,
he's up there with God,

24:36.809 --> 24:38.644
noshing on his holiest of holies
as we speak.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.730
- I'm gonna shut your fucking face--
- All right, all right.

24:40.730 --> 24:42.148
Keep your hair on, love.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.150
We just want a little chin wag's all.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.527
- Talk American.
- Right.

24:46.527 --> 24:49.739
You remember that magical summer
when you was 28,

24:49.739 --> 24:53.868
working as a counselor at the Capes
for Christ Bible Camp in Davie, Florida,

24:53.868 --> 24:56.078
and you met that lovely 15-year-old boy

24:56.078 --> 24:59.624
who tickled your fancy, and, well, then,
tickled more than that, didn't he?

24:59.624 --> 25:02.418
Hmm? Ring any bells?

25:02.418 --> 25:05.755
Here's a little keepsake snapped by
the Broward County Sheriff's Department

25:05.755 --> 25:07.423
that you can stash in your wank bank.

25:07.423 --> 25:11.552
You and your little Bieber
edging in the back of your RAV4

25:11.552 --> 25:13.846
in the car park of Buca di Beppo.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.389
Whatever voodoo
Vought's lawyers pulled

25:15.389 --> 25:17.058
to get your statutory charges dropped,

25:17.058 --> 25:18.226
I don't think they're gonna matter
too much

25:18.226 --> 25:19.977
to your evangelical audience back there.

25:19.977 --> 25:22.271
You're gonna tell us
everything you know

25:22.271 --> 25:25.566
about Sage and her grand plan,

25:25.566 --> 25:28.611
or I hit this little tweet button here.

25:36.327 --> 25:38.579
How about I just send it myself?

25:41.707 --> 25:43.793
Fuck around and find out.

25:45.461 --> 25:46.587
<i>"Starlight."</i>

25:46.587 --> 25:49.590
<i>That's nine letters,</i>

25:49.590 --> 25:52.426
<i>or is that six... upside down?</i>

25:52.426 --> 25:57.682
<i>"Annie January," 12 letters,
that's two more sixes.</i>

25:57.682 --> 26:00.393
<i>6-6-6. What more proof</i>

26:00.393 --> 26:02.645
<i>- could you possibly need?</i>

26:02.645 --> 26:04.230
<i>I'm sorry, I got to interrupt.</i>

26:04.230 --> 26:05.231
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

26:05.231 --> 26:07.066
<i>I need, I need to make a confession.</i>

26:07.066 --> 26:08.401
<i>A confession?</i>

26:08.401 --> 26:10.403
<i>I need to confess my sins.</i>

26:14.365 --> 26:16.701
<i>Ain't no way
to sugarcoat this.</i>

26:16.701 --> 26:17.994
<i>I had...</i>

26:19.704 --> 26:23.124
<i>...inappropriate relations</i>

26:23.124 --> 26:26.585
<i>with a sweet young man.</i>

26:26.585 --> 26:28.921
<i>Damn, that smile.</i>

26:28.921 --> 26:33.050
<i>But that young man, he was 15 years old.</i>

26:33.050 --> 26:36.846
- Oh...
<i>- But the moment of my greatest weakness</i>

26:36.846 --> 26:38.306
<i>was also the moment</i>

26:38.306 --> 26:42.059
<i>that pushed me to my eternal salvation.</i>

26:42.059 --> 26:43.644
<i>I was born again,</i>

26:43.644 --> 26:47.148
<i>and my sins were washed away</i>

26:47.148 --> 26:48.816
by the tears of His love.

26:48.816 --> 26:50.443
Praise the Lord!

26:50.443 --> 26:52.111
- Praise the Lord!

26:53.863 --> 26:55.489
<i>Now, I-I believe</i>

26:55.489 --> 26:58.284
that our Lord Jesus Christ
put that young man

26:58.284 --> 27:01.829
<i>in my life to lead me
to the path of righteousness.</i>

27:01.829 --> 27:03.622
- Oh, my God.

27:03.622 --> 27:07.918
<i>You got to choose to turn
in to the light of His love.</i>

27:07.918 --> 27:10.379
<i>And that's what Starlight,
she just didn't do.</i>

27:10.379 --> 27:13.466
<i>Y'all ever hear that story
about her very first save?</i>

27:15.009 --> 27:17.053
<i>She was only 13 years old,</i>

27:17.053 --> 27:21.265
<i>and, well, a gunman came into Walmart
and took hostages.</i>

27:21.265 --> 27:24.352
<i>Well, Starlight, she came in a'blasting.</i>

27:24.352 --> 27:26.520
<i>But what they don't tell you</i>

27:26.520 --> 27:31.025
<i>is that she blinded
one of those hostages that day.</i>

27:31.025 --> 27:36.447
<i>A mother of three, just trying to buy
Crunch Berries for her kids.</i>

27:36.447 --> 27:40.117
<i>But Starlight, she just went on,</i>

27:40.117 --> 27:45.081
<i>smiling for those cameras
like none of it ever happened.</i>

27:45.081 --> 27:46.582
<i>Starlight's no hero.</i>

27:48.417 --> 27:50.127
<i>She never was.</i>

27:59.470 --> 28:04.308
I was still learning
how to control my powers, I...

28:09.105 --> 28:10.231
Mademoiselle Annie.

28:16.237 --> 28:20.282
Well, whatever you attempted,
it seems you have failed.

28:20.282 --> 28:22.118
Not so fast, Frenchie.

28:23.452 --> 28:25.287
Keys to her trailer.

28:25.287 --> 28:27.373
Go give it a toss, will you?

29:29.602 --> 29:30.811
A-Train.

29:32.188 --> 29:33.981
What the fuck are you doing here?

29:33.981 --> 29:36.150
Taking V, huh?

29:40.070 --> 29:41.697
What the hell are you doing in here?

29:41.697 --> 29:43.199
Nothing.

29:47.703 --> 29:49.830
You left a floater
in his toilet?

29:49.830 --> 29:50.956
That was there when I got here.

29:50.956 --> 29:56.504
That is the most pathetic clapback
that I have ever seen.

29:56.504 --> 29:58.380
And you know, if Homelander knew,

29:58.380 --> 30:00.508
- that'll be the last shit you ever take.
- Oh, yeah?

30:00.508 --> 30:03.636
If Homelander knew you took that V,
he would flay you alive.

30:04.678 --> 30:06.430
Looks like we both have a problem.

30:08.057 --> 30:10.100
Looks like we do.

30:13.604 --> 30:16.857
So, what do we do about it?

30:33.290 --> 30:34.416
Marty.

30:34.416 --> 30:36.377
- Yeah?
- Come here for a sec.

30:40.881 --> 30:42.925
I'd like to apologize.

30:42.925 --> 30:44.218
For Frank.

30:45.302 --> 30:48.180
Look,
I guess I-I got a little grumpy,

30:48.180 --> 30:51.392
and I-I'm sorry.

30:51.392 --> 30:53.227
Can you forgive me?

30:53.227 --> 30:55.479
Of course.

30:55.479 --> 30:58.857
These things, these things happen.

31:01.235 --> 31:02.570
Thank you.

31:02.570 --> 31:04.780
You were always one of the kinder ones.

31:04.780 --> 31:05.990
That's right, John.

31:05.990 --> 31:09.118
-"Homelander."
- Homelander. We were friends.

31:09.118 --> 31:11.036
I was always nice to you.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.705
Yeah, that's right.

31:12.705 --> 31:14.957
You were. Mostly.

31:17.126 --> 31:19.503
Well, you remember the nickname
you had for me, right?

31:19.503 --> 31:21.922
- Mm-mm.
- Really?

31:22.965 --> 31:24.049
"Squirt."

31:24.049 --> 31:27.803
Yeah,
you called me Squirt, silly.

31:27.803 --> 31:29.888
You remember why?

31:29.888 --> 31:31.557
No.

31:31.557 --> 31:34.310
Oh, f-- Marty, okay.

31:34.310 --> 31:36.520
But you do remember, though,

31:36.520 --> 31:39.440
that I used to be left in there

31:39.440 --> 31:42.901
for hours, days on end.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.945
Completely alone. Right?

31:44.945 --> 31:47.698
Only... I was never really alone, was I?

31:47.698 --> 31:49.408
Mm?

31:49.408 --> 31:51.702
- Big Brother was always watching.

31:51.702 --> 31:55.998
You were always watching,
weren't you, Marty?

31:55.998 --> 31:57.666
Huh?

31:57.666 --> 32:01.462
But... growing boys have...

32:01.462 --> 32:06.008
certain needs, shall we say?

32:06.008 --> 32:09.762
So I figured out that when
you did your rounds at night,

32:09.762 --> 32:14.892
I had about a couple of minutes
to myself to, uh...

32:14.892 --> 32:17.728
well, to, uh, to do what boys do.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.690
And-and that would be the only time of day

32:21.690 --> 32:23.901
that I would feel anything good.

32:24.902 --> 32:28.739
So this one night, uh,
I couldn't get finished in time.

32:28.739 --> 32:31.950
And you caught me with my pants down.

32:31.950 --> 32:37.289
You had a really, really good laugh at me.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.124
Remember?

32:40.209 --> 32:42.211
That's when you nicknamed me Squirt.

32:42.211 --> 32:44.755
I got to be honest with you, Marty...

32:46.799 --> 32:49.051
...you really hurt my feelings.

32:53.097 --> 32:57.768
I am very sorry.

33:00.688 --> 33:02.690
What's done is done.

33:04.066 --> 33:05.651
Water under the bridge.

33:05.651 --> 33:06.819
Ha.

33:06.819 --> 33:08.904
But stay there a sec.

33:10.447 --> 33:16.203
I do want you to jerk off
in front of us right now.

33:16.203 --> 33:18.372
Hey, uh, guys, come on over here.

33:18.372 --> 33:20.624
Come on. Yeah.

33:21.667 --> 33:25.129
We're all gonna laugh at you. Okay?

33:26.171 --> 33:27.172
Yeah.

33:27.172 --> 33:30.592
That way, you will know how it feels,

33:30.592 --> 33:33.470
and I think I'm gonna feel better.

33:50.696 --> 33:51.947
Homelander...

33:54.074 --> 33:56.910
...I am really very sorry.

33:56.910 --> 33:58.162
I know, I know.

33:58.162 --> 34:00.164
Thank you.

34:00.164 --> 34:01.665
Now, don't be shy.

34:01.665 --> 34:04.001
Take your pants down.

34:04.001 --> 34:05.586
Now.

34:10.007 --> 34:12.050
Mm-hmm.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.428
That's the spirit.

34:27.941 --> 34:32.154
Marty, it looks like you're shucking
a little mushroom.

34:32.154 --> 34:34.990
- Oh, that poor little thing.

34:38.285 --> 34:40.204
Cheer for him. Come on.

34:40.204 --> 34:42.289
Squirt. Squirt. Squirt.

34:44.166 --> 34:45.542
Aw.

34:45.542 --> 34:47.377
Not off to a great start, huh?

34:47.377 --> 34:50.214
Tell you what,
I'll give you a little motivation.

34:50.214 --> 34:51.757
You get hard right now,

34:51.757 --> 34:54.551
or I'm gonna laser your dick off.

34:55.594 --> 34:56.595
Okay?

35:00.265 --> 35:02.059
Something to play for now. Mm?

35:02.059 --> 35:04.144
Use it or lose it, Marty.

35:04.144 --> 35:07.314
Your life is literally in your hands.

35:09.399 --> 35:10.901
Come on, Squirt.

35:15.906 --> 35:17.324
Yes!

35:17.324 --> 35:20.828
More spit, Marty, more spit.
That'll work.

35:20.828 --> 35:21.912
Come on!

35:21.912 --> 35:24.331
Put your fucking back into it. Attaboy.

35:25.916 --> 35:27.042
I can't.

35:27.042 --> 35:29.378
- Come on, Marty!
- I'm sorry.

35:29.378 --> 35:31.046
Oh, oh, okay, okay, okay.

35:31.046 --> 35:34.716
It's okay. Honestly,
it-it happens to a-a lot of guys.

35:34.716 --> 35:38.220
Truly. Not me, of course.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.681
Ah...

35:48.939 --> 35:51.066
That's a fucking squirt, Marty.

35:52.234 --> 35:55.028
Whoa, whoa! You're getting
dick blood on my boots, Marty.

35:56.738 --> 35:59.074
Stop it, John.

35:59.074 --> 36:01.368
Barbara.

36:04.121 --> 36:07.457
Um, the cake's melted, I'm afraid.

36:07.457 --> 36:10.502
Please put him out of his misery.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.221
I forgive you, Marty.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.315
Can we talk in private?

36:34.276 --> 36:36.278
That's a great idea.

36:36.278 --> 36:38.697
I know just the place.

36:40.782 --> 36:44.286
Um, it's more comfortable in my office.

36:46.747 --> 36:49.458
No,
I think in here is better.

37:05.724 --> 37:06.767
Kimiko!

37:09.561 --> 37:10.562
Holy shit!

37:31.708 --> 37:32.793
Ah!

37:33.835 --> 37:34.878
Oh, shit.

37:44.471 --> 37:45.764
Ah!

38:46.074 --> 38:47.534
Do you remember?

38:50.787 --> 38:52.789
After you offered me ice cream,

38:54.332 --> 38:57.210
then threw me into that trunk?

38:58.295 --> 38:59.963
You took me to the camp,

38:59.963 --> 39:01.757
dragged me into the fighting pit.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.551
I could either fight

39:05.218 --> 39:06.470
or die.

39:07.763 --> 39:10.474
Then you left me with these.

39:16.605 --> 39:18.398
I hate you.

39:46.676 --> 39:47.886
Kimiko...

40:07.739 --> 40:08.949
Bonjour.

40:32.389 --> 40:34.558
<i>Now,
y'all heard a lot tonight</i>

40:34.558 --> 40:37.394
<i>about who Starlight really is.</i>

40:37.394 --> 40:40.689
<i>But you still haven't seen
the true monster behind the mask.</i>

40:40.689 --> 40:42.399
And the truth...

40:44.359 --> 40:46.695
<i>...oh, it is so much worse
than you could ever imagine.</i>

40:46.695 --> 40:48.113
Oh, no.

40:48.113 --> 40:50.157
<i>Six months ago,</i>

40:50.157 --> 40:52.075
<i>Starlight visited a clinic.</i>

40:52.075 --> 40:53.994
<i>She wasn't going for a checkup.</i>

40:53.994 --> 40:55.620
What the fuck?

40:55.620 --> 40:57.497
<i>She found out</i>

40:57.497 --> 40:59.958
<i>that she was pregnant,</i>

40:59.958 --> 41:02.085
<i>and she had an abortion.</i>

41:03.211 --> 41:05.839
Are those my fucking medical records?

41:05.839 --> 41:09.843
<i>She was raised a Christian.</i>

41:09.843 --> 41:11.344
<i>She knew the difference</i>

41:11.344 --> 41:13.638
<i>between right and wrong.</i>

41:13.638 --> 41:16.892
<i>She knew exactly what she was doing.</i>

41:16.892 --> 41:18.852
<i>So you won't tell me
that those teens over there,</i>

41:18.852 --> 41:20.896
<i>that they're safe with her.</i>

41:20.896 --> 41:23.148
<i>With that baby killer?</i>

41:25.442 --> 41:26.902
Annie, wait.

41:29.029 --> 41:30.822
What do you think you're doing?

41:30.822 --> 41:33.158
<i>I'm sorry.
I must've gotten lost.</i>

41:33.158 --> 41:35.243
- Fucking hell. Frenchie.
<i>Who are you?</i>

41:35.243 --> 41:36.828
It is so embarrassing.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.705
I am Firecracker's biggest fan.

41:38.705 --> 41:40.457
I was just looking for a souvenir...

41:42.500 --> 41:44.502
<i>She could have
given it up for adoption.</i>

41:44.502 --> 41:48.006
But no. She murdered it.

41:51.885 --> 41:53.094
So you finally came to deb--

42:05.482 --> 42:07.609
Oi.

42:32.217 --> 42:34.219
How's that for "uppity," cracker?

42:35.845 --> 42:37.555
Stop.

42:37.555 --> 42:38.765
Look.

42:49.734 --> 42:51.152
<i>Look.</i>

42:51.152 --> 42:52.904
First pebble down the mountain.

42:52.904 --> 42:54.155
- Let's get out of here.

42:56.408 --> 42:58.076
Come on.

43:06.501 --> 43:08.211
Get up.

43:08.211 --> 43:09.337
Billy, come on, get up.

43:12.882 --> 43:14.259
Come on. Billy.

43:15.385 --> 43:16.636
You don't get to quit.

43:17.887 --> 43:19.306
Get up!

44:08.063 --> 44:09.814
Fucking hell.

44:11.858 --> 44:13.693
What the fuck?
Oh, shit.

44:13.693 --> 44:16.488
Frenchie!

44:16.488 --> 44:18.031
Oh, shit.
Oh, my God. Frenchie.

44:24.746 --> 44:26.039
What the fuck happened?

44:26.039 --> 44:28.208
Come on, let's get the fuck out of here.

44:30.752 --> 44:33.797
- What the fuck?

44:42.263 --> 44:43.431
It's funny.

44:43.431 --> 44:47.394
I-I remember it being so much bigger.

44:47.394 --> 44:50.063
You know why
I used to call this The Bad Room?

44:50.063 --> 44:52.649
It was just a room, John.
It's neither good nor bad.

44:52.649 --> 44:55.944
That's easy to say
from the other side of the door.

44:55.944 --> 44:58.822
- Now...
- Did you come back here
just to torment those people?

44:58.822 --> 45:03.284
Doesn't that feel a little...
a little small?

45:03.284 --> 45:07.455
They were just following orders.
Dr. Vogelbaum's, Stan Edgar's and mine.

45:07.455 --> 45:09.666
Yeah. But they followed them.

45:09.666 --> 45:14.963
Not one of them had the backbone
to stand up and say, "This is wrong."

45:14.963 --> 45:16.423
'Cause they were scared.

45:16.423 --> 45:18.550
- I was a child.
- They were scared.

45:21.094 --> 45:22.387
You know...

45:22.387 --> 45:25.849
I was there the day that you were born.

45:25.849 --> 45:30.353
They paid some poor runaway
two grand to carry the embryo to term.

45:30.353 --> 45:33.398
But you lasered her guts open
from the inside.

45:33.398 --> 45:36.151
You rose in the air
with your umbilical cord still attached,

45:36.151 --> 45:38.987
like some creature out of myth...

45:38.987 --> 45:40.905
or nightmare.

45:40.905 --> 45:43.908
You killed three doctors
and a nurse while you were at it.

45:43.908 --> 45:45.994
And then, just trust me,
it was downhill from there.

45:45.994 --> 45:50.039
So, yeah, yeah, everybody was
terrified of you, from your first breath.

45:50.039 --> 45:51.124
But you weren't?

45:52.876 --> 45:54.294
Hmm.

45:54.294 --> 45:56.796
We have no physical power over you.
We never did.

45:56.796 --> 45:59.257
You could've broken out of here
anytime you wanted.

45:59.257 --> 46:02.093
We couldn't have stopped you.
But you didn't.

46:04.679 --> 46:09.142
Because you couldn't stand the idea
that we would be disappointed in you.

46:10.935 --> 46:12.937
Your need for approval and for love.

46:14.272 --> 46:17.150
Vought brought in the best psychologists
in the world.

46:19.486 --> 46:23.698
Developed the protocol
to carefully engineer that need

46:23.698 --> 46:25.992
so that you would be obedient.

46:27.202 --> 46:31.164
In many ways,
that was our greatest success.

46:32.874 --> 46:35.418
I don't need any of it anymore.

46:35.418 --> 46:38.838
Doesn't matter what you do to me
or the rest of the staff here.

46:38.838 --> 46:41.799
Your need for love is so deep,
it's so human,

46:41.799 --> 46:44.677
you'll never be able to overcome that.

46:44.677 --> 46:46.930
That's where you're wrong.

46:46.930 --> 46:50.683
I'm not human. And neither is my son.

46:50.683 --> 46:53.895
And I'm going to raise him
so that he knows it.

46:57.607 --> 47:02.403
You know, I really do want to share
with you why I called this The Bad Room.

47:16.543 --> 47:18.127
Oh...

47:18.127 --> 47:20.547
Hey. Hey.

47:20.547 --> 47:22.590
Welcome back. You okay?

47:24.300 --> 47:26.094
Wow.

47:26.094 --> 47:28.846
I feel like I've been fixing you up
so much lately

47:28.846 --> 47:30.265
I should bill your HMO.

47:30.265 --> 47:32.725
- Colin, please.
- All right, I got to get you up.

47:32.725 --> 47:37.605
Colin, don't, please. Stop!
Stop being so fucking nice to me!

47:43.236 --> 47:44.445
It was me.

47:44.445 --> 47:46.823
W-What was you?

48:02.463 --> 48:04.549
It was you?

48:07.927 --> 48:09.637
I'm sorry.

48:19.022 --> 48:20.732
You're a fucking psychopath.

48:31.409 --> 48:33.369
Come on.

48:33.369 --> 48:34.829
Do it.

48:46.466 --> 48:48.760
If you come near me again...

48:50.845 --> 48:52.805
I'll fucking kill you.

49:18.498 --> 49:22.043
Yeah, so, you wanted to see me?

49:22.043 --> 49:26.005
Got you some of those fried pickles
and ranch from Flavortown.

49:26.005 --> 49:28.675
- This your way of apologizing?
- I need a favor.

49:29.967 --> 49:32.220
I don't get you, dude. Like, at all.

49:32.220 --> 49:34.430
You start off, you're a total bitch,

49:34.430 --> 49:36.641
and then you tell me I'm,
like, a superior being--

49:36.641 --> 49:38.101
which of course I like
and that you're down to pound,

49:38.101 --> 49:39.268
which obviously I will--

49:39.268 --> 49:40.603
I know.

49:44.941 --> 49:50.780
Most people, their brains grow till
they're about 25, then stop forever.

49:50.780 --> 49:53.783
Mine doesn't.
It regenerates, constantly.

49:53.783 --> 49:55.702
Stab me in the heart, I die.

49:55.702 --> 49:58.913
But stab me in the brain
and the little fucking bitch grows back.

50:03.418 --> 50:05.336
I want you to put this inside me.

50:08.047 --> 50:09.757
That's the worst dildo

50:09.757 --> 50:11.509
- I've ever seen, but--
- No.

50:11.509 --> 50:13.678
In my eye. Here.

50:16.764 --> 50:20.476
I am down for, like, a lot, but...

50:20.476 --> 50:21.644
It's temporary.

50:22.729 --> 50:23.730
Hmm?

50:23.730 --> 50:26.774
You give me a frontal lobotomy

50:26.774 --> 50:29.569
and I don't have to fucking be me
for a couple hours.

50:30.987 --> 50:34.949
Uh, that's just... fucking gross.

50:34.949 --> 50:37.535
I'll let you ass-fuck me while we
watch the Kim and Ray J video.

50:37.535 --> 50:40.121
Okay, so where do you want me to put it?
Just right there? Sit down.

50:45.126 --> 50:48.963
Now, avoid the eye itself.
I don't want to go blind.

50:55.762 --> 50:57.638
Ooh.

50:57.638 --> 50:59.140
Now, use the hammer.

50:59.140 --> 51:00.475
- The hammer? Fuck.
- Mm-hmm.

51:00.475 --> 51:01.976
Tap, tap.

51:04.437 --> 51:05.521
Again.

51:06.898 --> 51:08.357
- Okay.
- Oh, sorry.

51:08.357 --> 51:10.318
Hammer down.

51:10.318 --> 51:12.195
Now...

51:13.237 --> 51:14.405
- Scrape.
- Scrape it?

51:14.405 --> 51:17.241
Scrape my fucking brains out.

51:18.326 --> 51:19.702
- Oh...
- That's weird.

51:23.164 --> 51:25.041
Okay, okay, okay.

51:25.041 --> 51:27.960
You can take it out.

51:31.130 --> 51:32.632
- Oh, God...

51:32.632 --> 51:34.008
Hey, are you okay?

51:34.008 --> 51:36.052
Uh-huh.

51:36.052 --> 51:37.678
So... Hey.

51:39.013 --> 51:40.973
I have another Flavortown for you.

51:43.392 --> 51:45.895
- My pussy.
- Yes.

51:45.895 --> 51:49.982
<i>♪ Face down, ass up,
that's the way we like to fuck ♪</i>

51:49.982 --> 51:54.403
<i>♪ Face down, ass up, that's the way
we like to fuck ♪</i>

51:54.403 --> 51:56.531
<i>Today's events have
sadly confirmed my suspicions.</i>

51:56.531 --> 52:00.243
<i>While I respect President Elect Singer,</i>

52:00.243 --> 52:02.495
<i>it's disheartening to see him
align himself with Starlight,</i>

52:02.495 --> 52:05.039
<i>someone so clearly out of control.</i>

52:06.082 --> 52:09.961
<i>What's even more troubling is that
I considered Starlight a friend.</i>

52:09.961 --> 52:14.632
<i>But her violent, out-of-control attack
on Firecracker was</i>

52:14.632 --> 52:18.678
<i>someone I simply don't recognize.
I won't speculate on...</i>

52:31.399 --> 52:34.443
<i>And President Elect Singer
needs to wholeheartedly...</i>

52:38.281 --> 52:40.241
- Hey.
Oh, Jesus.

52:40.241 --> 52:42.869
- What happened to your leg?
- It's okay. I'm fine.

52:42.869 --> 52:45.538
But, look, I saw the Firecracker thing.
That fucking asshole.

52:45.538 --> 52:48.499
- No, no, I shouldn't have lost it.
- How could you not lose it?

52:48.499 --> 52:50.710
That was, like, the most private thing
between you and me.

52:50.710 --> 52:53.462
And to fucking broadcast it like that,

52:53.462 --> 52:54.797
- that's a fucking violation.
- Hughie.

52:54.797 --> 52:56.215
It's not helping, okay?

52:56.215 --> 52:58.676
Right, sorry, you're right.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

53:00.011 --> 53:03.431
I agonized over that decision.

53:04.765 --> 53:07.310
Agonized.
And you know I did.

53:07.310 --> 53:08.811
I just wasn't ready.

53:08.811 --> 53:10.396
I know. I mean, neither was I.

53:10.396 --> 53:13.774
And now when people look at me,
whether they're...

53:13.774 --> 53:18.237
supportive or judging or-or angry,

53:18.237 --> 53:22.116
I have to relive it.
Over and over and over again.

53:22.116 --> 53:23.367
And my mom...

53:26.412 --> 53:27.997
Have you talked to her?

53:27.997 --> 53:30.458
She won't return my calls.

53:30.458 --> 53:32.877
Okay. Come here.

53:32.877 --> 53:36.047
It's none of her business. Okay?

53:36.047 --> 53:38.883
- It is nobody's business but yours.

53:38.883 --> 53:39.967
Oh, shit.

53:39.967 --> 53:41.928
- I'm sorry, I have to take this.
- It's okay. Um...

53:41.928 --> 53:46.098
I, um, I have to pick up something
for my dad.

53:48.142 --> 53:49.685
- We'll talk later, okay?
- Okay.

53:49.685 --> 53:50.853
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

53:55.566 --> 53:56.651
Hello?

53:56.651 --> 54:00.738
<i>You know, friends tell friends
the truth, and...</i>

54:00.738 --> 54:04.867
The Supe Control bill
would've passed with flying colors.

54:04.867 --> 54:06.744
But after what you pulled today...

54:06.744 --> 54:11.457
<i>might as well call it
the Psycho Starlight Baby-Killer bill.</i>

54:12.541 --> 54:14.168
Are you still there?

54:14.168 --> 54:15.753
I'm sorry.

54:15.753 --> 54:19.465
<i>Sorry doesn't bring back
all the Republican votes you just torched.</i>

54:19.465 --> 54:22.051
I can't be affiliated with you anymore.

54:54.500 --> 54:58.004
It's bullshit, right?
You're not gonna forgive me.

55:01.674 --> 55:03.426
Yeah. Thought so.

55:05.136 --> 55:06.887
Wait.

55:09.306 --> 55:10.683
You're right, I...

55:10.683 --> 55:13.185
I was gonna tell you to go fuck yourself.

55:13.185 --> 55:14.895
But I changed my mind.

55:16.439 --> 55:17.773
We're good.

55:35.666 --> 55:37.918
You fucking dog-wanker.

55:41.922 --> 55:43.340
Jesus. How long have you
been standing there?

55:43.340 --> 55:44.675
Long enough.

55:46.135 --> 55:47.303
How could you?

55:47.303 --> 55:49.805
I-I didn't, I didn't do it for him.

55:51.432 --> 55:53.476
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life hating anybody.

55:56.729 --> 55:58.898
What you gonna do with that, then?

55:59.940 --> 56:02.401
I mean, you're probably the only guy
that would understand,

56:02.401 --> 56:04.070
but I was going to give it to my dad.

56:04.070 --> 56:05.362
- Oh, Hughie.
- Look, I know.

56:05.362 --> 56:10.117
I know it's insane and terrible,
but what other choice do I have?

56:10.117 --> 56:12.453
Any other fucking choice, you twat.

56:14.371 --> 56:15.956
You're really telling me
that you wouldn't take some

56:15.956 --> 56:17.208
if you were in his shoes?

56:17.208 --> 56:19.418
'Cause you kind of are.

56:19.418 --> 56:21.670
There's enough here.

56:21.670 --> 56:24.006
It'd save you, too.

56:24.006 --> 56:26.509
It's got to beat
dying of brain cancer, right?

56:26.509 --> 56:27.968
I already took some.

56:29.178 --> 56:32.389
<i>Nicked it out of Frenchie's desk
four months ago.</i>

56:33.682 --> 56:36.352
- Thought it might cure me.
- Jesus.

56:36.352 --> 56:38.437
Do you have powers?

56:38.437 --> 56:40.106
No.

56:40.106 --> 56:43.567
<i>All it did was bring up the big day.</i>

56:43.567 --> 56:47.696
I'm telling you, quit while you're behind.

56:48.781 --> 56:50.825
You'll only make matters worse.

57:12.555 --> 57:15.599
What happened to me back there?

57:30.364 --> 57:32.449

57:32.449 --> 57:36.704

- You okay?
- Yeah, I just tripped.

58:04.523 --> 58:06.233
How is he?

58:07.484 --> 58:09.195
Well...

58:09.195 --> 58:11.655
The doctor said any time now.

58:36.805 --> 58:39.266
No, no.

58:39.266 --> 58:41.185

58:42.394 --> 58:44.021
