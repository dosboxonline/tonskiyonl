[somber music playing]

00:29.988 --> 00:32.198
-All right. Down.
-[Liz grunting]

00:32.282 --> 00:33.491
Oh, my God.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.998
It's him. Townsend.

00:40.081 --> 00:42.917
You should go. There could be others.

00:43.001 --> 00:46.379
[Dembe] I'll call Edward. Tell him
to have a medical team standing by.

00:46.463 --> 00:48.882
-Can you walk?
-Walk?

00:50.008 --> 00:51.176
Townsend's dead.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.219
I could fly.

00:53.928 --> 00:55.263
[grunting]

01:00.226 --> 01:03.897
The bullet went clear through.
No organs were damaged. She'll be fine.

01:03.980 --> 01:07.901
Thank you. Have yourself a drink.
Make it a double. You deserve it.

01:11.237 --> 01:12.989
You deserve it too.

01:13.740 --> 01:14.616
You won.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.623
I wish there was time for celebration.

01:22.123 --> 01:26.044
But Mother Nature and the criminal world
quickly exploit a vacuum.

01:26.127 --> 01:28.296
We should set a time to see Harold.

01:29.172 --> 01:30.089
Call Dr. Clemons.

01:30.173 --> 01:34.177
Thank him for his services
and tell him they're no longer necessary.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.221
-Did you find another doctor?
-No.

01:37.555 --> 01:39.390
You're giving up.

01:40.058 --> 01:42.185
Why? You just said
there's a fight to be won.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.269
There is.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.607
But it can't really be won
unless I'm gone.

01:49.192 --> 01:53.071
Perhaps I will have that drink after all.
Toast to better days.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.163
Will it end when I know?

02:03.456 --> 02:07.210
When Reddington's told me the last of it,
will I be able to live a normal life?

02:09.129 --> 02:10.421
What is normal?

02:12.173 --> 02:13.258
Not this.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.928
We live the lives we are meant to live.

02:17.720 --> 02:21.558
I understand you blaming Raymond
for how yours turned out.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.768
I blame him too sometimes.

02:25.687 --> 02:29.691
But fate takes the laboring oar.
In our lives and his.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.402
Fate and destiny.

02:34.445 --> 02:38.366
Ah! You're up. Excellent.
I have a bit of a surprise for you.

02:38.449 --> 02:39.951
-Mommy!
-Hey!

02:40.034 --> 02:42.787
Oh, pumpkin. What are you doing here?

02:42.871 --> 02:44.747
[Agnes] It was Pinky's idea.

02:44.831 --> 02:45.874
Pinky?

02:45.957 --> 02:49.043
He says his name is Red,
but I prefer pink.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.005
I thought she'd be just the thing.

02:52.088 --> 02:57.051
And as it turns out, Mrs. French and I
share a great love for Jacques Tati.

02:57.135 --> 02:58.344
Oh. [chuckles]

02:58.428 --> 03:02.682
-How are you, my dear?
-I'm better now. Thanks to Pinky.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.778
-Oh, Mr. Reddington!
-Aram. Nice.

03:18.114 --> 03:21.034
[in high-pitched voice] I heard
about Townsend. We're so relieved.

03:22.827 --> 03:25.121
What's the celebration?
Who's getting well?

03:25.204 --> 03:28.082
Oh, these are for Agent Ressler.
He's off the ventilator.

03:28.166 --> 03:31.628
-The doctors say he's doing much better.
-That's good news.

03:33.463 --> 03:34.505
Care for a toke?

03:34.589 --> 03:38.134
I'd give almost anything to hear you talk
like a member of the Lollipop Guild.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.719
[chuckles]

03:40.762 --> 03:41.763
[knocking on door]

03:41.846 --> 03:42.680
Come in.

03:44.140 --> 03:47.060
What a relief. Knowing the threat
to Agent Keen is gone.

03:47.143 --> 03:49.020
[in high-pitched voice]
We're all quite happy

03:49.103 --> 03:51.272
with the way things turned out, Harold.

03:52.273 --> 03:55.318
And here I thought Aram was
the only man-child around here.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.695
Please tell me you're above such things.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.823
[in high-pitched voice] I think it's
childish and completely unprofessional.

04:02.867 --> 04:06.246
[in normal voice] Please indulge
our weakness for life's simple pleasures.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.498
We've come bearing dark tidings.

04:08.581 --> 04:11.251
You wanna tell me,
or you'd like finger-painting first?

04:11.334 --> 04:14.837
[chuckles] I would.
More than you can possibly imagine.

04:14.921 --> 04:18.549
But, unfortunately,
Townsend's death is about to trigger

04:18.633 --> 04:21.010
a firestorm of criminal activity.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.971
In the absence of a clear successor,

04:23.054 --> 04:26.266
everyone will be vying
for control of his empire.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.434
I assume you're here to give me a case.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.396
That the next name
on the Blacklist will be in service

04:31.479 --> 04:33.481
to help you take advantage
of this situation.

04:33.564 --> 04:37.193
I do have a bunch of likely contenders
for the throne.

04:37.277 --> 04:42.615
And I am giving you them so that someone
can take advantage of this situation.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.742
-But not me.
-How magnanimous.

04:44.826 --> 04:48.079
I've heard
that one's true colors emerge at the end.

04:48.162 --> 04:51.249
I'd love to think
that magnanimity is one of mine.

04:52.583 --> 04:55.003
The end? I knew you were sick, but...

04:56.129 --> 04:57.338
Exactly how bad is it?

04:57.422 --> 04:59.048
Harold, over the years,

04:59.132 --> 05:03.261
you've served
as a wise counselor to Elizabeth.

05:03.344 --> 05:07.265
I'd like to know that in my absence,
that would continue.

05:08.057 --> 05:09.017
Raymond.

05:09.892 --> 05:11.060
How sick are you?

05:11.144 --> 05:12.687
Do I have your word?

05:12.770 --> 05:16.065
Of course. I'll always do
everything I can for Elizabeth.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.776
Thank you. You're a good friend.

05:20.361 --> 05:21.571
[door opens]

05:22.822 --> 05:24.574
Is this really necessary?

05:25.742 --> 05:29.245
It's the best way I can think of
to ensure her protection.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.541
Your blood tests are better.
The treatment is working.

05:33.624 --> 05:35.335
You're getting better, not worse.

05:35.835 --> 05:40.131
I'm dying. Whether it's this year
or the next doesn't matter.

05:40.214 --> 05:42.008
What I've got doesn't go away.

05:42.091 --> 05:45.511
It just takes a pause, regroups
and comes back stronger.

05:45.595 --> 05:46.596
Deadlier.

05:56.314 --> 05:57.648
Where's Agnes?

05:57.732 --> 05:59.692
Mrs. French took her to the park.

06:00.943 --> 06:04.363
Thank you for bringing her here.
That was very thoughtful.

06:10.703 --> 06:15.792
The conversation we've been having--
Or trying to have.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.046
About who I am
and why I came into your life.

06:20.129 --> 06:22.715
How my mother got you to watch over me.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.550
Your mother. Yes.

06:26.385 --> 06:28.179
She foresaw this moment.

06:30.723 --> 06:34.727
The answers are here.
In a letter she wrote to you.

06:35.394 --> 06:37.396
[dramatic music playing]

06:38.856 --> 06:40.942
Why do you have a letter
my mother wrote to me?

06:41.025 --> 06:45.113
For when the time was right
to let you know the truth.

06:45.196 --> 06:49.450
I think we can both agree
it's long past time.

06:50.201 --> 06:53.162
-One condition remains.
-No. No conditions.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.622
One task.

06:56.207 --> 06:57.458
Then it's done.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.420
What could possibly be left for me to do?

07:03.464 --> 07:04.674
To take my life.

07:08.803 --> 07:09.846
What do you mean?

07:09.929 --> 07:12.807
I mean literally and metaphorically.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.017
I'm dying.

07:15.643 --> 07:18.062
You've known for a while that I'm sick.

07:19.564 --> 07:20.982
Before I die...

07:23.025 --> 07:25.111
I need to make sure you're protected.

07:26.779 --> 07:29.490
And how will killing you do that?

07:29.574 --> 07:33.369
By showing the world
you're a force to be reckoned with.

07:34.412 --> 07:37.039
That you did what no one else could.

07:37.123 --> 07:40.668
No law-enforcement agency,
no criminal rival.

07:40.751 --> 07:44.297
You found and executed Raymond Reddington.

07:45.673 --> 07:48.468
You know
I don't wanna take over your empire.

07:48.551 --> 07:49.719
I do.

07:49.802 --> 07:53.222
And under other circumstances,
I wouldn't want you to.

07:56.684 --> 07:59.770
But Neville Townsend learned
certain things about me.

08:00.605 --> 08:04.317
Things that we should assume
others now know as well.

08:04.400 --> 08:09.238
I'm afraid that people will come for you
just like Townsend did.

08:10.198 --> 08:14.160
It took all of our strength to fight him.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.955
You'll need help to fight the others.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.875
This is the way to get it.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.177
It's quite a story.

08:32.887 --> 08:33.721
Full of...

08:35.640 --> 08:37.308
ambition and hope.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.147
Love and loss.

08:46.150 --> 08:47.360
How does it end?

08:48.611 --> 08:49.737
You'll find out.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.001
[jazz music playing over speakers]

09:06.587 --> 09:08.172
[Liz] Oh, you're so cute!

09:08.798 --> 09:12.426
[sighs] I could just squeeze you
like this forever.

09:13.010 --> 09:14.637
Where's Pinky?

09:14.720 --> 09:17.723
[Liz] <i>You know,</i>
<i>I don't know where Pinky is.</i>

09:17.807 --> 09:21.227
I never quite know
where Pinky's gonna show up next.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.604
He's funny. He tells me stories.

09:23.688 --> 09:26.315
Oh, yeah? What kind of stories?

09:26.399 --> 09:28.150
About a Russian princess.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.902
She doesn't want to be a princess,

09:29.986 --> 09:33.489
but other people keep telling her
it's her destiny.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.578
What do you think she should do?

09:38.661 --> 09:41.872
Mom. She's a princess! [giggles]

09:49.505 --> 09:53.384
[Liz] <i>I got train tickets for 4 p.m.</i>
<i>I'll meet you at the station.</i>

09:53.467 --> 09:55.886
<i>I got some people I wanna say goodbye to.</i>

09:57.513 --> 10:00.099
It won't take long to close up
the apartment in New York.

10:00.182 --> 10:04.145
We'll sleep on the jet and be in Europe
by this time tomorrow.

10:04.228 --> 10:07.857
This will be so good for you two.
To get away from it all.

10:08.858 --> 10:09.734
Yeah.

10:14.697 --> 10:15.698
I hope so.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.413
We've had some times.

10:25.082 --> 10:26.042
We have.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.005
[car horn honks]

10:34.216 --> 10:35.092
Get in.

10:37.386 --> 10:39.722
-Have you spoken to Reddington?
-I knew he was sick,

10:39.805 --> 10:41.724
but I had no idea it was this severe.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.809
[dramatic music playing]

10:44.810 --> 10:47.188
He asked me to take over for him.

10:49.607 --> 10:50.941
I'm not surprised.

10:51.859 --> 10:52.735
I said no.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.407
I'm leaving.

11:02.286 --> 11:03.579
We're gonna get away.

11:04.872 --> 11:07.166
I wanted to tell you in person.

11:07.249 --> 11:09.960
And thank you
for everything that you've done.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.463
So your mind's made up?

11:13.047 --> 11:15.132
About taking over for Reddington?

11:16.884 --> 11:18.803
Is there a decision to make?

11:20.721 --> 11:22.556
There's so much I want for you.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.060
Above all, I want you to be safe.

11:26.602 --> 11:29.188
Right now, you're a fugitive
on the Most Wanted List.

11:29.271 --> 11:33.150
If you took over for Reddington,
inherited the Blacklist,

11:33.692 --> 11:36.529
I could probably convince Panabaker
to give you immunity.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.114
You'd be protected,

11:38.572 --> 11:41.992
you'd have a reason for taking over
that you could feel good about.

11:42.076 --> 11:43.619
We could still work together.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.456
Taking over for Reddington has risks.
Physical and emotional.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.125
Both of those concern me.

11:51.585 --> 11:54.755
But you not doing it concerns me more.

11:57.675 --> 12:01.137
-How's Ressler?
-On the mend. Worried about you.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.764
Yeah, I wanna see him.

12:05.307 --> 12:06.684
Probably safer to call.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.145
Yeah.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.480
Where's the fun in that?

12:29.915 --> 12:30.791
Hey.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.961
I heard you're feeling better.

12:35.129 --> 12:36.589
Well, I am now.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.386
I've got a decision to make.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.013
Cooper's wrong.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.474
He called you?

12:47.141 --> 12:50.311
You're not like Reddington. You're better.

12:51.353 --> 12:52.480
You're good.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.690
Too good to do what he wants you to do.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.027
I don't feel good.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.488
You're not a criminal.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.699
Pretending to be one won't keep you safe.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.327
[tender music playing]

13:14.001 --> 13:16.462
[Cooper] Russian mob.
Serbians. Italians. Chinese.

13:16.545 --> 13:19.507
And a few Americans
and Brits thrown in for good measure.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.175
All did business with Townsend.

13:21.258 --> 13:22.968
According to Reddington, all want a piece.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.261
Mr. Reddington doesn't?

13:24.345 --> 13:27.890
He wants us to move on the United Nations
of Crime so he can take over.

13:27.973 --> 13:31.602
But not for himself, for Elizabeth.
So she can take over.

13:31.685 --> 13:33.812
-That's not funny.
-It wasn't meant to be.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.064
But she can't.

13:35.147 --> 13:38.484
I mean, even if she could, she wouldn't.

13:38.567 --> 13:40.319
-Would she?
-[Park] Why would he let her?

13:40.402 --> 13:42.613
What would he do, go play golf?

13:42.696 --> 13:46.367
Reddington's sick. He wouldn't say
with what, but it's clearly terminal.

13:46.450 --> 13:49.495
Wait. Mr. Reddington? But...

13:51.247 --> 13:52.957
He always seems so invulnerable.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.793
He isn't. Neither is Elizabeth.

13:56.669 --> 14:00.297
If she decides to take over
for Reddington, she'll need our help.

14:00.381 --> 14:04.468
Starting with a workup
on the people in this folder.

14:05.719 --> 14:08.514
I'm in the chairs next to the escalators.

14:10.057 --> 14:11.600
Okay. I'll see you soon.

14:12.142 --> 14:14.144
[suspenseful music playing]

14:15.854 --> 14:16.730
[girl] Excuse me?

14:17.356 --> 14:19.316
I'm sorry. I don't mean to stare.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.277
Are you Agent Keen?

14:21.360 --> 14:22.653
Elizabeth Keen?

30:09.057 --> 30:10.600

<i>I have to believe that I can help.</i>

30:31.663 --> 30:34.624

<i>Is he gonna die?</i>

31:56.247 --> 31:57.874
Yeah, honey. He is.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.335
That is sad.

32:00.418 --> 32:01.502
I know.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.757
But I think
my friend is trying to be brave.

-Dembe, will you stop the car, please?
-What's the matter?

32:29.447 --> 32:30.740
I want to walk.

32:31.324 --> 32:33.993
-It's not safe.
-I'll meet you at the restaurant.

[Agnes] <i>You always say that even though</i>

34:06.169 --> 34:07.336
I think she already left.

34:07.420 --> 34:08.504
Except she hasn't.

34:08.588 --> 34:12.508
Elizabeth phoned Aram. She's in D.C.
She also asked for his forgiveness.

34:12.592 --> 34:13.968
Forgiveness? For what?

34:14.052 --> 34:16.971
Your guess is as good as mine,
but I fear it has something to do

34:17.055 --> 34:20.183
with Reddington positioning her
to be the heir to his criminal empire.

34:20.266 --> 34:21.517
So he convinced her.

<i>If he wants her to be taken seriously,</i>
<i>if she's gonna be respected in his world,</i>

Aram's forgiveness.

What do you mean?
You're alive, that is incredible news.

-I thought you were not gonna make it.
-Thankfully, he did.
