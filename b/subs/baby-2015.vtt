02:53.459 --> 02:56.292
'We were born, because of the 26/11.

02:56.917 --> 02:58.792
A sensible man in Delhi...

02:58.876 --> 03:01.834
convinced another
sensible and powerful man...

03:02.501 --> 03:05.001
that, not every battle
is fought at the border.

03:05.876 --> 03:07.084
He also managed to convince...

03:07.167 --> 03:09.584
that, there's no glory
in dying on our own land.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.707
In fact, it's in striking
them hard on their ground.

03:11.876 --> 03:13.876
After countless
meetings and debates...

03:14.042 --> 03:19.001
and squandering the tax-payer's
money, it was finally decided...

03:19.417 --> 03:22.542
that, an Elite program
will be tested for 5 years.

03:22.876 --> 03:24.876
'And depending upon the results...'

03:25.126 --> 03:27.459
'...the future course
of action would be decided.'

03:27.542 --> 03:30.251
'I was made in-charge
of this program.'

03:30.334 --> 03:33.251
'12 People were chosen from
the Police and Para-Military forces.

03:33.334 --> 03:36.501
'After they agreed,
their records are burnt...'

03:36.667 --> 03:37.917
'...and the rules were set.'

03:39.626 --> 03:41.209
'If they were caught...'

03:41.459 --> 03:43.376
'...then, they government
would exercise...'

03:43.751 --> 03:45.751
'...PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY.'

03:46.709 --> 03:48.126
'This meant two things.'

03:48.834 --> 03:51.334
'First of all,
their own country, their nation...'

03:51.417 --> 03:53.542
'...would deny any
knowledge of them.'

03:54.209 --> 03:59.084
'And secondly, they were just a bank
account number for this government.'

03:59.959 --> 04:02.501
'They were then sent abroad
to train with the best.'

04:02.917 --> 04:05.501
'Their job was to hunt
down danger and threat.'

04:05.667 --> 04:07.709
'Regardless of it been
in any corner of the world.'

04:08.084 --> 04:10.709
'Since this was just
a 5 year test run...'

04:11.376 --> 04:15.334
'...we called our
Black-Op unit "Baby".

04:15.709 --> 04:18.292
'In the next 4 years,
"Baby" built deep assets...

04:18.417 --> 04:21.001
made intercepts,
and directly or indirectly...'

04:21.084 --> 04:25.126
'...prevented around
24 blasts in the country.'

04:25.917 --> 04:28.126
'We also cought
13 Most Wanted...'

04:28.334 --> 04:30.126
'...and did 8 encounters.'

04:30.751 --> 04:33.917
'We were very successful,
but we paid a price too.'

04:35.042 --> 04:36.667
'After 4 years, only 4

04:37.084 --> 04:40.417
'...from my original 12 man
team survived.'

04:41.667 --> 04:44.084
'This story is about
Baby's last mission.'

04:44.542 --> 04:49.251
'We believed that our training
and experience were adequate.'

04:50.042 --> 04:51.251
'We were wrong.'

05:05.667 --> 05:08.417
Look at his face he looks so pretty.

05:08.667 --> 05:11.167
C'mon kill him.

05:13.167 --> 05:14.709
C'mon man kill him.

05:14.917 --> 05:16.709
What are you doing?

05:27.126 --> 05:28.876
- Jai Hind, sir.
- Jai Hind.

05:33.626 --> 05:34.917
Sir, we've traced Rakesh.

05:35.042 --> 05:37.209
They're constantly changing his
profile photos using his own phone.

05:37.292 --> 05:38.501
God damn it!

05:38.709 --> 05:40.292
Someone from his
family might see this.

05:40.459 --> 05:41.820
- Block it immediately.
- Sure, sir.

05:44.876 --> 05:46.334
Kill him.

05:48.334 --> 05:51.042
One more time,
just finish him fast. - Yeah.

05:51.251 --> 05:52.501
Losing now.

05:54.584 --> 05:55.667
Jamal turned on us.

05:55.834 --> 05:57.167
He got Rakesh captured.

05:57.334 --> 05:58.792
They're planning serial blasts, sir.

05:58.876 --> 06:00.709
- Where?
- Somewhere in Delhi.

06:00.917 --> 06:01.876
He's the handler for Lashkar...

06:02.084 --> 06:03.084
- When?
- Today!

06:03.481 --> 06:04.602
We don't know anything else.

06:04.626 --> 06:05.376
No specifics.

06:05.542 --> 06:07.001
- Where's Ajay?
- In the van.

06:18.501 --> 06:21.334
Foreign language.

06:21.417 --> 06:23.584
Foreign language.

06:25.459 --> 06:27.042
- Can I?
- Yes.

06:29.626 --> 06:30.626
Yes, sir.

06:30.792 --> 06:32.751
- What's going on?
- They're discussing.

06:33.209 --> 06:35.289
One wants to help,
and the other one is stopping him.

06:35.376 --> 06:37.042
Someone's using Rakesh's phone.

06:37.542 --> 06:39.251
Sameer's sending you the coordinates.

06:39.501 --> 06:40.876
- Leave now!
- Yes.

06:40.959 --> 06:43.834
If the permission had come, why do we
still keep him? Let us leave him.

06:43.917 --> 06:44.876
We are waiting for the intel
about him, we will act accordingly.

06:44.959 --> 06:46.334
Excuse me.

06:49.542 --> 06:52.626
Hello take him to a restaurant...

06:52.709 --> 06:55.001
but be careful,
he should not escape, okay.

06:57.751 --> 06:58.751
Thank you.

08:53.167 --> 08:54.459
C'mon.

08:57.292 --> 08:59.584
C'mon fast.

09:01.209 --> 09:03.292
Harder... Harder...

09:37.251 --> 09:38.542
Look at his face man.

09:38.792 --> 09:39.834
That was good.

10:28.417 --> 10:29.667
Do you want one more?

10:30.126 --> 10:31.709
Yeah, of course.

10:33.417 --> 10:35.709
Give it to him, right in the face.

11:17.626 --> 11:18.667
Oh no!

11:22.959 --> 11:24.667
- Yes, sir.
- Status?

11:25.001 --> 11:26.084
Sir, Jamal escaped.

11:26.459 --> 11:27.501
And Rakesh?

11:27.959 --> 11:29.292
He's not looking good, sir.

11:32.876 --> 11:33.876
Take the call.

11:34.542 --> 11:35.542
Okay.

11:41.792 --> 11:45.167
Rakesh! Rakesh!

12:19.709 --> 12:22.459
Move... move...

12:40.001 --> 12:41.001
HEY-

13:21.376 --> 13:22.626
HEY-

15:00.876 --> 15:02.251

Foreign language.

15:06.709 --> 15:09.209

15:09.417 --> 15:12.417
Foreign language.

15:12.501 --> 15:14.334
Excuse me. May I?

15:17.667 --> 15:18.667
Okay.

15:19.751 --> 15:20.876
Thank you.

15:33.542 --> 15:35.376
You broke my trust, Jamal.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.834
Jamal, where's the location?

15:44.751 --> 15:46.292
Jamal, what's the location?

15:47.167 --> 15:48.917
Where in Delhi, Jamal?

15:49.376 --> 15:51.792
DLF Promenade Mall...

16:15.251 --> 16:16.891
The mall is nicely crowded,
where are you?

16:28.084 --> 16:29.126
DLF Promenade.

16:29.417 --> 16:30.417
Copy, sir!

16:40.251 --> 16:41.417
What time?

16:41.917 --> 16:44.292
- How many guys?
- What's the time?

16:45.917 --> 16:47.001
What did you say?

16:47.417 --> 16:48.542
What's the time?

16:59.834 --> 17:00.834
Yes tell me.

17:01.251 --> 17:02.251
Bismillah.

17:08.209 --> 17:09.792
How do you feel now?

17:23.834 --> 17:27.584
Get Jamal's entire
family to DLF Promenade Mall... now!

17:27.876 --> 17:29.084
All of them.

17:33.792 --> 17:36.084
Your family's been
on stand-by since morning.

17:37.376 --> 17:40.917
Mom-Dad, wife Zoya, sister Noorie.

17:41.501 --> 17:43.334
Even your 6 month old kid.

17:47.459 --> 17:50.001
I want to see you
laughing over their deaths.

17:50.251 --> 17:52.542
- You can't do this.
- Why?

17:53.126 --> 17:54.292
Don't you remember?

17:54.709 --> 17:55.917
I can do anything.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.126
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.709
Greetings.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.376
What's the name of your kid, Jamal?

18:16.251 --> 18:18.084
How did I forget?

18:19.167 --> 18:20.251
Mohsin right?

18:23.042 --> 18:24.251
Congratulations!

18:24.459 --> 18:26.376
Young Mohsin's going to be a martyr.

18:27.876 --> 18:32.376
It's just that he doesn't know what
a big a****e his father is.

18:32.667 --> 18:34.042
And, if you wanted
to see him die so soon...

18:34.126 --> 18:36.327
why did bring him into this world
in the first place?

18:41.376 --> 18:42.501
Yes!

18:44.126 --> 18:47.251
Makes Jamal's family stand right
in the middle of the Mall. - No.

18:47.459 --> 18:50.001
Why is Mohsin crying?

18:52.501 --> 18:55.501
Tell him... soon his
hunger will be satiated.

18:58.876 --> 19:00.334
How about a live-telecast?

19:01.834 --> 19:03.251
You want to see the live telecast?

19:03.334 --> 19:06.251
Basement 3...Grey van.

19:06.917 --> 19:08.251

19:08.459 --> 19:10.376
- What cell?
- Minar cell.

19:11.376 --> 19:13.001
Fazal and Salim.

19:13.209 --> 19:14.667
Take them out, and call me back.

19:45.751 --> 19:46.876
Go!

20:42.834 --> 20:44.334
I'll see you later.

20:44.876 --> 20:46.042
Thank you.

20:56.167 --> 20:57.248
Where's Iqbal, where is he?

21:13.810 --> 21:14.810
Yeah, Jai.

21:14.834 --> 21:16.126
Operation successful, sir.

21:16.209 --> 21:17.417
We'll be out in 10.

21:17.501 --> 21:18.876
Any casualty on our side?

21:19.501 --> 21:20.501
Negative.

21:20.834 --> 21:23.834
Hand over Jamal,
and take the first flight out.

21:24.084 --> 21:25.084
Right, sir.

21:30.667 --> 21:31.959
Why did you do it?

21:34.209 --> 21:35.542
You were one of my own.

21:36.334 --> 21:38.294
There are going to be so
many fireworks this year.

21:39.376 --> 21:40.834
How many can you stop?

21:43.459 --> 21:44.584
You can take him in.

21:51.334 --> 21:52.792
Jamal!

22:09.001 --> 22:12.001
How would I know that he will jump...

22:12.084 --> 22:13.667
Damn it...

22:40.751 --> 22:41.751
Bilal.

22:42.667 --> 22:44.626
Someone's here from
your lawyer's office.

22:44.709 --> 22:46.292
Needs you to sign something.

23:21.792 --> 23:22.792
Go.

23:35.667 --> 23:36.709
Greetings.

23:38.876 --> 23:40.209
Greetings.

23:42.417 --> 23:44.959
You called... ls everything okay?

23:46.792 --> 23:48.251
Have you ever been in jail?

23:51.209 --> 23:52.709
What about my bail?

23:54.209 --> 23:55.709
They're trying"-

23:55.792 --> 23:57.251
Tell them to expedite.

23:59.167 --> 24:00.542
Call +92...

24:00.834 --> 24:02.084
Tell them to get active.

24:02.667 --> 24:03.667
Yes.

24:03.751 --> 24:07.042
The ATS are starting
to connect the dots.

24:07.959 --> 24:09.167
Yes, I will.

24:10.417 --> 24:12.834
The Delhi Mission failed.

24:16.917 --> 24:18.167
Amazing...

24:19.251 --> 24:21.459
These guys can't even
keep their pants up...

24:22.334 --> 24:24.001
and they dream to be Martyrs.

24:28.959 --> 24:31.334
Taufiq bhai was asking...

24:34.751 --> 24:37.084
the date's drawing closer.

24:38.084 --> 24:40.626
If you could tell us
where do we have to place the stuff.

24:43.084 --> 24:47.709
Tell Taufiq if he's so concerned...

24:49.084 --> 24:50.959
then first get me out of here.

24:53.751 --> 24:55.334
I am not a**

24:59.834 --> 25:03.709
I heard that Kasab
was given an A/C cell.

25:06.001 --> 25:08.126
I've obviously done more than him.

25:21.893 --> 25:22.893
Hello.

25:22.917 --> 25:24.251
He isn't listening.

25:24.751 --> 25:26.751
Says call up the neighbors first.

25:27.376 --> 25:28.792
First he wants out of here.

25:29.126 --> 25:30.792
Only then will He cooperate.

25:31.542 --> 25:32.542
What?

25:50.667 --> 25:52.459
Where they caught?

25:52.667 --> 25:55.334
No, they attained salvation.

25:56.876 --> 25:58.917
Allah have mercy.

25:59.751 --> 26:04.792
Do you know why our
these little efforts failing?

26:07.334 --> 26:10.959
Allah wants us
to do something big.

26:11.709 --> 26:13.084
Amen.

26:15.751 --> 26:18.251
Take a trip to India, Javed.

26:18.834 --> 26:19.917
Yes.

26:21.792 --> 26:25.042
It's time to get Bilal Khan out.

26:42.292 --> 26:45.626
'Chants'

26:45.792 --> 26:49.126
'Chants'

26:49.209 --> 26:52.667
'Chants'

26:52.751 --> 26:55.501
'Chants'

26:55.584 --> 26:58.751
'Chants'

26:58.834 --> 27:02.542
'Chants'

27:03.792 --> 27:11.792
I started this mission
with the grace of Allah.

27:13.209 --> 27:17.126
I just received news...

27:17.501 --> 27:24.876
America's put a bounty...

27:25.042 --> 27:29.667
of 10 million Dollars on my...
On Maulana Mohammad Rehman's head.

27:29.751 --> 27:34.709
And India is really
happy to hear this.

27:34.876 --> 27:38.417
I want to advice...

27:39.667 --> 27:45.834
America and
India on this occasion.

27:47.334 --> 27:52.501
They should direct their
time... and their monies...

27:52.667 --> 27:58.251
for their people.

27:58.501 --> 28:04.584
Contribute it for the progress...

28:05.167 --> 28:09.792
of our Muslim brothers
and sisters living in their countries.

28:10.542 --> 28:12.834
Because...

28:13.042 --> 28:15.959
Mohammad Rehman...

28:16.209 --> 28:21.292
cannot be caught...

28:22.834 --> 28:26.292
until America
recedes from Pakistan...

28:27.376 --> 28:32.251
and Kashmir recedes from India!

28:32.334 --> 28:37.792
'Chants'

28:37.876 --> 28:41.584
India claims that yesterday...

28:41.667 --> 28:44.167
we killed some of
their men on the border.

28:44.251 --> 28:45.876
'Chants'

28:45.959 --> 28:49.292
'Chants'

28:49.334 --> 28:51.542
'Chants'

28:51.626 --> 28:57.126
What were they doing on our land?

28:59.459 --> 29:04.292
This has always
been India's attitude.

29:05.167 --> 29:07.667
They always project that
it's entirely our mistake.

29:07.792 --> 29:12.001
'Chants'

29:12.084 --> 29:16.751
'Chants'

29:16.834 --> 29:20.834
'Chants'

29:21.042 --> 29:25.084
'Chants'

29:36.292 --> 29:37.709
Morning, gentlemen.
Good morning.

29:37.792 --> 29:38.542
Have a seat, Feroz.

29:38.626 --> 29:39.626
Thank you, sir.

29:40.792 --> 29:42.084
It was close.

29:42.834 --> 29:45.167
What was Rakesh doing in Istanbul?

29:45.834 --> 29:48.667
We had an agent Jamal,
who turned rogue.

29:49.084 --> 29:52.251
He was recruiting for
Lashkar and Islamic Jihad.

29:52.709 --> 29:54.792
Rakesh was on a mission to finish him.

29:54.876 --> 29:56.626
But Jamal got better of him.

29:57.001 --> 29:59.459
You're making quite a
good habit of all this, Feroz.

29:59.834 --> 30:01.042
You saved lives.

30:01.459 --> 30:02.626
Their failures...

30:02.876 --> 30:05.876
Their continuous failure
is very soon going to demoralize them.

30:05.959 --> 30:07.251
Congratulations.

30:08.251 --> 30:09.334
Congrats, Feroz.

30:09.417 --> 30:11.792
With due respect,
sir, I beg to differ.

30:12.084 --> 30:13.209
With which part?

30:13.376 --> 30:14.792
They're not failing, sir.

30:15.542 --> 30:17.126
Jamal was my man.

30:17.542 --> 30:19.209
He worked under me.

30:19.626 --> 30:21.126
It's our failure...

30:21.334 --> 30:23.667
that he left us and
joined the enemy.

30:23.917 --> 30:25.542
Jamal was a traitor.

30:25.626 --> 30:27.126
It's not that simple.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.209
Jamal was an Indian.

30:29.959 --> 30:31.167
The point being?

30:31.251 --> 30:34.209
In the Taj attack,
the man who gave out instructions...

30:34.292 --> 30:37.459
from Karachi's control room,
Zabi-Uddin-Ansari...

30:38.042 --> 30:41.876
known as Abu Jindal,
also known as Abu Hamza...

30:42.042 --> 30:43.542
is not a Pakistani.

30:44.042 --> 30:46.167
He's an Indian by birth.

30:46.542 --> 30:48.834
These terrorist organizations
have succeeded...

30:48.917 --> 30:52.709
in convincing people,
that India is not their country.

30:53.042 --> 30:57.167
And to act against it,
by using their religion as tool.

30:57.709 --> 31:00.792
And now, our children
are being recruited...

31:01.542 --> 31:05.792
from right under our noses,
for terrorist training camps.

31:06.751 --> 31:09.501
And after completing
their training...

31:09.542 --> 31:13.334
they come back
from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh or Nepal.

31:14.501 --> 31:16.584
Using Facebook and Twitter...

31:16.876 --> 31:18.876
anyone can trigger a riot...

31:18.959 --> 31:22.417
in any part of our country
right from his sitting desk.

31:22.917 --> 31:25.209
What they couldn't achieve
from the outside.

31:25.542 --> 31:28.376
Is now getting initiated from within.

31:28.542 --> 31:32.542
And the bitter truth is, if
the members of the community feel...

31:32.626 --> 31:36.042
they do not belong here,
and they're losing faith in us.

31:37.167 --> 31:38.209
Then...

31:38.876 --> 31:43.084
that is the terrorist
organization's biggest success...

31:43.167 --> 31:45.167
and our biggest failure, sir.

31:56.126 --> 31:57.167
Greetings, brother.

31:57.251 --> 31:58.542
Greetings.

31:58.626 --> 32:00.084
Greetings.

32:04.042 --> 32:05.126
Please come.

32:48.084 --> 32:49.417
Why didn't you call?

32:50.959 --> 32:52.834
I thought I'll surprise you.

32:53.584 --> 32:54.834
You're still awake.

32:55.376 --> 32:56.584
Was reading something.

32:57.792 --> 32:58.876
I missed you.

33:00.376 --> 33:01.584
I missed you too.

33:03.417 --> 33:05.084
When will you stop lying?

33:18.251 --> 33:19.834
Arjun doesn't...

33:20.417 --> 33:22.917
but this naughty one keeps
asking of you all the time.

33:38.042 --> 33:39.209
I need a drink.

33:39.292 --> 33:40.376
You'll have something?

33:40.542 --> 33:41.542
No!

33:42.167 --> 33:43.792
How was your...- Conference?

33:44.876 --> 33:46.584
Same old... boring.

33:47.167 --> 33:48.334
Come, I'll tell you.

33:53.876 --> 33:55.959
The presentation
was on the 3rd Day.

33:57.001 --> 33:59.542
Mr. Shukla was fiddling
with the computer.

33:59.917 --> 34:01.459
But he couldn't turn it on.

34:01.959 --> 34:03.376
He started sweating.

34:04.459 --> 34:05.820
People were
wondering what's wrong.

34:05.834 --> 34:07.501
I was wondering too.

34:08.209 --> 34:11.251
Later we realized that
Mr. Shukla...

34:11.751 --> 34:13.626
hasn't pressed the power button.

34:15.792 --> 34:18.792
Why do you always make up a story?

34:20.292 --> 34:23.001
I can understand, you
can't share your work with me.

34:24.959 --> 34:29.001
You'll need a story,
it's important.

34:31.542 --> 34:32.834
Why?

34:35.667 --> 34:37.667
What if I don't return someday?

34:40.251 --> 34:42.459
There must be some story about me.

34:43.542 --> 34:46.501
For Arjun, you... Ananya.

34:46.792 --> 34:48.042
Our friends.

34:49.584 --> 34:50.834
You know how it is.

34:51.084 --> 34:52.292
Shut up!

34:53.084 --> 34:54.959
I told you let's not get married.

34:55.792 --> 34:59.751
Yes, and when I said let's not...

35:00.251 --> 35:02.584
then why did you keep chasing me?

35:03.501 --> 35:05.001
I didn't want to lose you.

35:09.376 --> 35:11.209
I don't love you.

35:23.834 --> 35:30.417
"I don't... love you."

35:30.501 --> 35:36.751
"I don't... love you."

35:36.834 --> 35:43.334
"But every single evening..."

35:43.417 --> 35:51.417
"wait for you."

35:56.751 --> 36:03.501
"I don't... love you."

36:03.584 --> 36:11.084
"But the day you're not here..."

36:11.417 --> 36:17.376
"The city seems strange."

36:18.167 --> 36:24.001
"Every bud looks unknown."

36:25.167 --> 36:31.334
"Everything feels unfamiliar."

36:31.417 --> 36:35.417
"I love you."

36:40.501 --> 36:44.251
The hearing on Jamshed Rashid,
aka Bilal Khan's case just ended.

36:44.393 --> 36:45.393
Today's case was dismissed...

36:45.417 --> 36:47.834
due to absence of witnesses.

36:48.084 --> 36:51.042
The next hearing
is on 4th of the next month.

36:51.167 --> 36:53.001
And as you can see, behind me...

38:16.709 --> 38:17.876
Yes.

38:18.667 --> 38:20.084
The van is coming.

39:27.667 --> 39:29.126
I'm doing.

39:33.251 --> 39:34.792
Stay there.

41:16.167 --> 41:17.251
Hello.

41:23.292 --> 41:25.001
In breaking news... Bilal Khan...

41:25.084 --> 41:29.042
who was arrested last month from
Nagur for a serial blast case...

41:29.126 --> 41:31.209
has managed to flee from custody.

41:32.227 --> 41:33.227
Okay.

41:33.251 --> 41:34.971
You are going to get a
day off school today.

41:35.167 --> 41:36.501
- Yes.
- Okay.

41:36.584 --> 41:37.792
Where are we going?

41:38.209 --> 41:39.501
Shopping-

41:39.584 --> 41:40.709
- Shopping.
- Shopping.

41:40.792 --> 41:41.917
- Movie.
- Movie.

41:42.001 --> 41:42.917
- And then movie.
- Doremon.

41:43.001 --> 41:43.709
Doremon 2.

41:43.792 --> 41:45.709
We'll go watch Doremon 2.
Doremon 5.

41:46.251 --> 41:48.959
And then we'll go have dinner.

41:49.126 --> 41:52.209
After lunch,
we'll go to the ice-skating rink.

41:52.709 --> 41:54.126
We'll go for a picnic.

41:54.209 --> 41:55.876
Okay then we'll go for a picnic.

41:56.584 --> 41:58.292
We'll have great fun.

41:58.584 --> 41:59.876
Yes, we'll have great fun.

42:01.876 --> 42:03.709
Papa's phone is ringing again.

42:08.126 --> 42:09.126
Yes.

42:11.667 --> 42:12.792
On my way.

42:22.751 --> 42:24.167
Just don't die.

43:00.626 --> 43:01.959
Javed Khan is in Mumbai.

43:02.042 --> 43:03.167
That explains?

43:03.251 --> 43:05.209
Sir, that explains everything.

43:14.167 --> 43:16.334
These are the Airport
CCTV footage grabs.

43:16.542 --> 43:17.751
Arrived from Dubai yesterday.

43:17.917 --> 43:18.917
Is it him?

43:19.792 --> 43:20.917
That's him, sir.

43:21.584 --> 43:23.084
- Is he under arrest?
- No.

43:23.292 --> 43:25.542
ATS has received a tip,
they're waiting for us.

43:39.501 --> 43:40.584
Come sir.

43:41.334 --> 43:42.667
Sir, that's Aftab.

43:42.876 --> 43:44.167
He's the one who tipped us.

43:44.459 --> 43:47.751
Approached us after watching
the news about Bilal Khan's escape.

43:48.417 --> 43:49.876
And that's his father.

43:51.084 --> 43:52.084
Ajay.

44:05.459 --> 44:07.042
Aftab, take a seat.

44:11.334 --> 44:12.584
How old are you?

44:13.501 --> 44:15.334
Sir, I'm 23 years old.

44:16.501 --> 44:17.626
Qualification?

44:18.959 --> 44:20.042
I'm an engineer, sir.

44:20.542 --> 44:22.126
So you're both, cool and smart.

44:25.834 --> 44:27.334
So tell me what do you want to share.

44:28.917 --> 44:32.959
Sir, I was in FSC 2nd year,
engineering when all this started.

44:33.876 --> 44:35.292
Sameer and Junaid were my friends.

44:35.792 --> 44:38.167
And they introduced me to Taufiq bhai.

44:42.251 --> 44:43.917
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

44:48.959 --> 44:52.459
Taufiq arranged some
private scholarships...

44:53.459 --> 44:55.376
keeping my academic
performance in mind.

44:56.542 --> 44:58.126
I thought I deserved it.

45:01.001 --> 45:05.251
But soon after he called
me and showed me some videos.

45:08.751 --> 45:09.959
Videos of...

45:10.126 --> 45:11.126
riots...

45:12.084 --> 45:13.084
killings...

45:14.584 --> 45:16.042
People getting slaughtered.

45:18.417 --> 45:19.459
I was shaken, sir.

45:22.501 --> 45:24.541
Since that day,
I started receiving similar links...

45:24.751 --> 45:28.959
on my Facebook,
Twitter and Gmail accounts.

45:29.584 --> 45:32.417
The Assam link, Gujarat link and...

45:33.667 --> 45:34.792
Many more.

45:35.251 --> 45:40.167
Around 6 months ago
I was called and told...

45:40.376 --> 45:43.834
that I, Sameer and
Junaid along with 2 others...

45:44.251 --> 45:47.084
were going to Nepal
for special training.

45:47.459 --> 45:49.251
And we were also told that...

45:49.334 --> 45:51.126
we were chosen amongst thousands.

45:54.001 --> 45:59.417
L...lied to mom and dad...

46:00.084 --> 46:02.376
that we're going on a college trip.

46:07.126 --> 46:10.376
Right after landing at Kathmandu
airport we were taken to Rautahat.

46:20.501 --> 46:22.042
And after spending a night there...

46:22.126 --> 46:25.459
we were loaded on to
a truck and taken to the border.

46:43.709 --> 46:46.709
Our training lasted for 2 weeks.

46:49.001 --> 46:52.959
We were trained to assemble
improvised explosive device.

47:10.626 --> 47:12.001
When they conducted a test...

47:13.917 --> 47:15.501
they all praised me.

47:16.584 --> 47:17.667
Because I was the best.

47:19.459 --> 47:20.667
How were you be the best?

47:21.959 --> 47:26.251
Sir, I know how to trigger a CWID,
VOID and RCID.

47:26.334 --> 47:27.751
Even if it's command-wire...

47:27.834 --> 47:30.834
radio, cellphone
or victim operated.

47:31.251 --> 47:32.876
I've learnt everything.

47:33.667 --> 47:37.667
Sir, Taufiq bhai called
us yesterday for a meeting.

47:38.917 --> 47:41.709
Each of us was assigned a task.

47:42.376 --> 47:45.334
Some were supposed to deliver goods...

47:45.751 --> 47:48.334
while others were asked
to collect some stuff.

47:49.042 --> 47:53.167
Sir, there is an 11
year old kid amongst us.

47:54.126 --> 47:55.501
His name's lmran.

47:56.709 --> 47:58.834
Sir, he's my uncle's son.

48:00.001 --> 48:03.126
What would he know
what right or wrong?

48:05.084 --> 48:06.584
What are they planning?

48:08.626 --> 48:10.126
I don't know, sir.

48:10.292 --> 48:13.626
I only saw Bilal Khan's
photo in the meeting.

48:13.709 --> 48:14.792
And...

48:16.251 --> 48:19.376
This morning when I saw the news.
Where's Bilal?

48:21.042 --> 48:22.876
I don't know, sir.

48:24.376 --> 48:25.584
Where's Javed.

48:26.251 --> 48:27.542
I don't know, sir.

48:27.792 --> 48:29.542
Last night few men arrived
from Pakistan.

48:29.626 --> 48:31.376
This is our small home.

48:31.459 --> 48:33.501
You can call it our headquarters.

48:35.626 --> 48:39.334
Sameer told me that one of
them was Javed Khan.

48:39.584 --> 48:42.542
Only Taufiq bhai knows where they are.

48:42.751 --> 48:44.251
And where can I find Taufiq?

48:44.876 --> 48:45.959
Zeenat Mahal.

48:46.501 --> 48:48.626
Sir, they need Bilal.

48:49.292 --> 48:52.459
And... they're planning something big.

48:53.209 --> 48:56.917
Do you have any photo of Taufiq?
Yes, sir.

48:59.060 --> 49:00.060
Sir...

49:00.084 --> 49:03.292
9821311...

49:05.542 --> 49:06.709
Sir...

49:13.417 --> 49:16.792
Aftab, what you are doing needs
a lots of courage.

49:19.167 --> 49:20.167
Look at me.

49:22.417 --> 49:23.626
I'm proud of you.

49:24.792 --> 49:26.001
We're all proud of you.

49:31.459 --> 49:32.542
Good luck.

49:33.001 --> 49:34.251
And cooperate with these guys.

49:34.501 --> 49:35.751
- Okay.
- Okay Sir.

49:37.209 --> 49:39.001
So, Ajay, how do you want to do it?

49:39.834 --> 49:41.042
It's a small operation, sir.

49:41.292 --> 49:43.251
I would like to lead
a small team of ATS' men.

49:43.584 --> 49:44.584
Sounds good.

49:49.376 --> 49:50.876
Yes, sir, I'll keep you posted, sir.

49:51.251 --> 49:52.376
Okay sir.

49:54.667 --> 49:56.667
Is it anyone's happy birthday today?

49:56.751 --> 49:58.001
- No.
- No, sir.

49:58.459 --> 50:01.376
Sir, it's my marriage anniversary.

50:01.584 --> 50:02.667
How many years has it been, Gawde?

50:02.751 --> 50:03.751
16 years sir.

50:04.390 --> 50:06.310
If you have survived your
marriage of 16 years...

50:06.334 --> 50:07.292
you'll survive this too.

50:07.376 --> 50:08.376
Don't worry.

50:08.584 --> 50:11.209
Sir, with you around
we've got nothing to worry.

50:11.292 --> 50:12.584
In fact, we enjoy it.

50:12.667 --> 50:17.042
Sir you don't recall but we were
together during the opera house ops.

50:17.334 --> 50:19.001
Gawde, what happened
to your moustache?

50:20.084 --> 50:22.376
Sir because of the
marriage anniversary...

50:22.459 --> 50:24.751
my wife asked me
to sport a clean look.

50:41.292 --> 50:43.042
Move. Move.

50:45.542 --> 50:46.792
Move.

50:47.126 --> 50:48.292
Move.

50:58.320 --> 50:59.560
Uncle, where can I find Taufiq?

50:59.584 --> 51:01.834
- Taufiq? First floor.
- Thank you.

51:09.917 --> 51:12.501
Stand aside.

51:15.501 --> 51:16.959
ATS Mumbai.

51:17.417 --> 51:19.334
We need to have a small chat.

51:31.251 --> 51:33.501
Let me tell you something.

51:46.667 --> 51:48.917
These people love me a lot.

51:49.709 --> 51:53.959
As long as you're here, they will stop
all work and keep standing outside.

51:54.959 --> 51:58.042
And the crowd outside
Zeenat Mahal will also keep growing.

51:59.126 --> 52:01.751
So... what brings you here?

52:01.917 --> 52:04.376
Where are Bilal and Javed Ali Khan?

52:06.821 --> 52:09.102
What would you like to have?
Some tea, coffee, cold drink?

52:09.126 --> 52:11.001
Some other time,
I'm in a bit of a hurry today.

52:11.376 --> 52:12.959
I just want two people,

52:13.251 --> 52:15.667
Where are Bilal and Javed Ali Khan?

52:16.542 --> 52:20.626
Let me... tell you a small story.

52:22.209 --> 52:23.667
Listen carefully.

52:24.459 --> 52:27.251
Remember the 2008 bomb blasts.

52:27.751 --> 52:30.292
Two days later the
police stormed at my place.

52:30.751 --> 52:31.917
Someone tipped them that...

52:32.001 --> 52:34.334
some kids from
the Indian Mujahiddin...

52:34.709 --> 52:36.626
have sought refuge here.

52:37.542 --> 52:41.459
They interrogated me continuously for
three days in their own style.

52:41.542 --> 52:43.417
But I didn't utter a word.

52:45.084 --> 52:46.917
I knew! But no!

52:49.126 --> 52:51.376
Two days later, those kids...

52:51.542 --> 52:53.417
reached their destination,
safe and sound.

52:54.501 --> 52:57.751
Some ba*** betrayed us, but not me.

52:59.709 --> 53:03.876
You know that religion
column that we have?

53:04.876 --> 53:09.792
I write Muslim, in Bold and Capital.

53:12.001 --> 53:14.459
And now about your question?

53:15.584 --> 53:17.001
Who Bilal?

53:18.792 --> 53:20.626
Who Javed Ali Khan?

53:20.959 --> 53:22.751
Let me tell you a small story too.

53:25.501 --> 53:27.084
I was in the Para-Military forces.

53:27.292 --> 53:30.626
We were deployed in
Gujarat's Hindu-Muslim riots.

53:31.542 --> 53:34.292
We received an alert,
that a Muslim family...

53:34.584 --> 53:36.251
comprising of mother, father,
13 year old kid...

53:36.334 --> 53:37.459
they were stuck in the interiors.

53:37.709 --> 53:41.167
And a radical Hindu militant
organization had got news of them.

53:42.042 --> 53:44.001
My colleagues were occupied...

53:44.084 --> 53:47.167
and since I was the closest,
I responded.

53:47.563 --> 53:49.643
When I arrived at the location,
the family thought...

53:49.667 --> 53:51.209
that I was there to kill them.

53:51.376 --> 53:53.292
After a great difficulty
they were assured.

53:53.834 --> 53:56.501
In the evening, the crowd
arrived waving the Hindutva flag...

53:56.584 --> 53:59.042
with swords, guns and petrol bombs.

54:01.292 --> 54:04.459
I fought alone... for 24 hours.

54:05.334 --> 54:06.917
I was also shot twice.

54:07.542 --> 54:09.584
Seven people were killed
by me that day.

54:10.292 --> 54:13.092
But I kept that family safe and didn't
allow one scratch on the family.

54:16.084 --> 54:18.251
That religion column
that you were talking about..

54:19.042 --> 54:21.876
We write 'Indian'
in Bold and Capital there.

54:28.501 --> 54:33.334
Look, if even get a scratch on me...

54:33.459 --> 54:34.580
Why would you get a scratch?

54:51.001 --> 54:52.501
Come on.

54:52.584 --> 54:54.417
Everyone, come on...

54:55.084 --> 54:56.959
Everyone, come on...

54:57.126 --> 54:58.251
Get down.

55:12.584 --> 55:14.251
Everyone, come on...

55:14.542 --> 55:15.959
Come on.

55:22.209 --> 55:24.584
Sir he want to say something.

55:24.834 --> 55:26.626
- Are you sure?
- Yes sir.

55:34.001 --> 55:35.292
Where's Bilal?

55:37.334 --> 55:38.501
Where's Bilal?

55:40.042 --> 55:42.501
Only... Javed knows.

55:42.584 --> 55:43.834
Where's Javed?

55:47.751 --> 55:51.251
14...Raybury Road, William Docks.

55:51.417 --> 55:53.376
- Did you record that?
- Yes, sir.

55:53.459 --> 55:56.626
Stay back...- I said stay back...

55:58.251 --> 55:59.834
Stay back...

56:00.459 --> 56:03.126
- Stand here.
- Listen to me.

56:03.209 --> 56:04.376
I said stay back...

56:04.459 --> 56:05.709
Why are you coming forward?

56:05.792 --> 56:06.876
Stay back...

56:07.376 --> 56:10.376
Taufiq, those people
are standing out there...

56:10.584 --> 56:13.209
because they don't
know the truth about you.

56:13.667 --> 56:16.001
They don't know
that you're an ISI agent.

56:16.792 --> 56:20.459
If we don't find Javed
at this given address...

56:20.876 --> 56:23.626
then we'll broadcast
this clipping on breaking news.

56:23.959 --> 56:27.292
And then we'll see how much
These guys really love you.

56:27.667 --> 56:29.042
Move.

56:52.417 --> 56:54.459
Move back.

56:54.542 --> 56:56.376
Move. Move.

56:56.876 --> 56:58.542
Move...

57:00.209 --> 57:01.376
Move...

57:05.185 --> 57:06.185
Yes, Ajay-

57:06.209 --> 57:07.042
Sir, we've an address.

57:07.126 --> 57:08.334
We're heading there.

57:08.417 --> 57:10.578
I'm sending you a video-clip, sir.
It's just an update.

57:10.626 --> 57:12.167
And needs no action, sir.

57:12.268 --> 57:13.268
Are you okay?

57:13.292 --> 57:14.653
Of course, sir.
I'll call you back.

57:14.792 --> 57:15.792
Good.

57:17.209 --> 57:19.292
Gawde, you have to throw
a party after this is over.

57:19.376 --> 57:20.417
Of course, sir.

57:42.459 --> 57:45.251
I reached there,
but he was stuck in traffic.

57:47.334 --> 57:49.167
Now not me...

58:12.459 --> 58:13.959
Usmaan!

58:43.417 --> 58:46.751
Javed Khan, hands up.

58:50.834 --> 58:52.626
- Gawde.
- Yes, sir.

58:53.292 --> 58:55.459
You wanted an anniversary present,
didn't you?

58:55.751 --> 58:58.209
Will an imported one do?
Of course, sir.

58:58.292 --> 58:59.751
Take him in.

59:00.501 --> 59:02.292
We need to show him our hospitality.

1:00:48.376 --> 1:00:50.542
News has just come in
from William Dock, Mumbai...

1:00:50.626 --> 1:00:53.209
where one of the most dreaded
terrorist Javed Ali, from LeT...

1:00:53.292 --> 1:00:56.251
killed himself and 4 police
officers in a suicide explosion.

1:00:56.792 --> 1:00:59.126
One officer was also reportedly
injured in the attack.

1:00:59.626 --> 1:01:01.709
ATS Mumbai carried
out the operation...

1:01:01.792 --> 1:01:03.792
led by a tip
and raided the compound.

1:01:03.876 --> 1:01:06.417
They were successful
in gunning down 8 terrorists.

1:01:27.292 --> 1:01:29.709
Excuse me sir, something to drink?

1:02:03.167 --> 1:02:05.251
Firstly, Rehman sir...

1:02:05.459 --> 1:02:08.167
the allegation made by India.

1:02:08.459 --> 1:02:11.126
Regarding the recent
terrorist attacks...

1:02:11.417 --> 1:02:13.084
and Bilal Khan's escape.

1:02:13.542 --> 1:02:17.709
Your name always comes up
along with these incidents.

1:02:18.167 --> 1:02:20.042
What is your opinion about it?

1:02:20.584 --> 1:02:25.001
India is a disturbed nation.

1:02:26.917 --> 1:02:28.917
Rehman sir,
you didn't answer my question.

1:02:29.126 --> 1:02:30.417
I did.

1:02:30.834 --> 1:02:33.542
India is a disturbed nation!

1:02:34.417 --> 1:02:35.709
Why is India disturbed?

1:02:36.042 --> 1:02:37.667
It's their mind set.

1:02:38.459 --> 1:02:40.417
They're disturbed by Pakistan.

1:02:41.126 --> 1:02:43.084
They're disturbed by me.

1:02:43.501 --> 1:02:45.667
Whenever anything wrong
happens in India...

1:02:45.751 --> 1:02:49.917
Pakistan and I get blamed for it.

1:02:50.584 --> 1:02:53.626
India has warned that
if we don't cooperate...

1:02:53.709 --> 1:02:54.584
they will launch
a surgical strike...

1:02:54.667 --> 1:02:56.376
Bhaijaan!

1:02:58.376 --> 1:03:01.126
I know India.

1:03:02.292 --> 1:03:04.626
They can do nothing.

1:03:05.334 --> 1:03:07.001
All they do is talk.

1:03:07.792 --> 1:03:10.001
They shed tears and wail.

1:03:11.459 --> 1:03:16.834
They can do nothing now,
and they never ever will. Lnsha allah.

1:03:45.268 --> 1:03:46.268
Yes, Sameer.

1:03:46.292 --> 1:03:47.459
Sir, please come down.

1:03:51.792 --> 1:03:52.792
Yes Sameer.

1:03:52.917 --> 1:03:54.667
Sir, Javed's hard drive is on.

1:03:55.167 --> 1:03:56.167
See.

1:03:58.626 --> 1:04:02.376
Isn't that Wasim Sheikh?
Yes, sir.

1:04:02.459 --> 1:04:04.459
Last seen in Karachi, in 2011.

1:04:05.167 --> 1:04:08.501
But... according to IB he's dead.

1:04:08.751 --> 1:04:09.917
No, sir, lB's wrong.

1:04:10.001 --> 1:04:11.667
He's alive and is in Nepal.

1:04:12.042 --> 1:04:13.667
His new name is Abdul Haq.

1:04:14.042 --> 1:04:16.834
And from out there he handles
recruitments for Lashkar and IM.

1:04:17.001 --> 1:04:18.917
And he also raises funds for Rehman.

1:04:19.417 --> 1:04:21.542
Wasim and Javed were
in constant touch with him.

1:04:21.626 --> 1:04:24.126
He is the one who funded Bilal's
rescue operation.

1:04:24.292 --> 1:04:26.001
These are few emails
shared between them.

1:04:26.459 --> 1:04:27.876
They have used childish code words.

1:04:27.959 --> 1:04:29.584
It took me less than
5 minutes to crack.

1:04:31.792 --> 1:04:32.876
CD means Revolver.

1:04:33.042 --> 1:04:34.584
DVD means Assault Rifles.

1:04:34.709 --> 1:04:36.709
Pen Drive means
Bullets and Detonators.

1:04:37.417 --> 1:04:39.501
They used the word 'Dawaati' here.

1:04:39.709 --> 1:04:41.667
It means preparation for blast.

1:04:42.042 --> 1:04:43.042
'Shaam' mean Delhi.

1:04:43.084 --> 1:04:44.292
'Musa' means Gujarat.

1:04:44.376 --> 1:04:45.501
'Baigu' means Bangalore.

1:04:45.584 --> 1:04:46.626
H is 'Hyderabad'.

1:04:47.501 --> 1:04:49.417
They're planning something
really nasty and big.

1:04:50.001 --> 1:04:51.876
And Bilal is in-charge
of the operation.

1:04:52.584 --> 1:04:56.292
In short, Wasim Sheikh has
all the answers to your questions.

1:04:56.709 --> 1:04:59.001
Can you find Wasim's
present location?

1:04:59.084 --> 1:05:00.626
He is in Kathmandu.

1:05:00.834 --> 1:05:02.754
He runs a Tours and
Travels business, as a front.

1:05:02.834 --> 1:05:05.334
I have been tracking his online
activities since this morning.

1:05:05.501 --> 1:05:07.417
He spent two hours
on the internet.

1:05:07.584 --> 1:05:08.917
Primarily watching
Indian news sites...

1:05:09.001 --> 1:05:10.376
and on-line channels.

1:05:10.626 --> 1:05:12.751
Later, he made an online
transfer of 12,000...

1:05:12.917 --> 1:05:14.334
to his family in Lucknow.

1:05:14.584 --> 1:05:18.626
After that he Googled for
Sunny Leone's sexy wallpapers.

1:05:19.126 --> 1:05:20.751
And he was there for some time.

1:05:22.917 --> 1:05:24.584
Good job, Sameer. Well done.

1:05:25.001 --> 1:05:26.001
Thank you sir.

1:05:27.459 --> 1:05:28.876
What do you say, Ajay?

1:05:30.334 --> 1:05:32.542
Sir let's get Wasim.

1:05:33.376 --> 1:05:35.177
If we go through the process,
it'll take ages.

1:05:35.542 --> 1:05:36.667
And if we inform
the local authorities...

1:05:36.751 --> 1:05:38.001
the media will find out.

1:05:38.292 --> 1:05:39.542
Let's keep it discreet Sir.

1:05:40.626 --> 1:05:43.584
Did you hear Rehman's speech?
Yes, sir. I did.

1:05:44.292 --> 1:05:45.501
It's our fault, sir.

1:05:46.459 --> 1:05:48.709
When the Americans
killed Osama in Abbottabad...

1:05:48.876 --> 1:05:50.417
some of our politicians
excitedly stated...

1:05:50.459 --> 1:05:54.626
that, we should carry
out surgical strikes too.

1:05:54.709 --> 1:05:56.042
To get Abdul Rehman...

1:05:56.542 --> 1:05:57.584
But if only they had quietly
carried out the strike...

1:05:57.667 --> 1:05:59.001
instead of propagating it...

1:05:59.084 --> 1:06:01.167
then today we would've
been in a better position.

1:06:01.917 --> 1:06:03.209
How many do you need?

1:06:03.376 --> 1:06:04.376
One!

1:06:04.707 --> 1:06:06.227
We'll do a honey trap,
sir and we need,

1:06:06.251 --> 1:06:07.626
Ground support
for our safe return.

1:06:07.709 --> 1:06:08.959
We will keep it very simple.
In and out.

1:06:09.126 --> 1:06:11.334
Wasim will be our custody,
Before anyone knows.

1:06:11.792 --> 1:06:12.959
Sounds good.

1:06:14.417 --> 1:06:17.209
But... we'll have to inform
these imbeciles.

1:06:19.584 --> 1:06:21.667
I just jot that down in my diary...

1:06:23.292 --> 1:06:24.417
Hold on.

1:06:27.126 --> 1:06:28.126
Yes, Feroz sir.

1:06:28.209 --> 1:06:30.042
Mr. Gupta, how are you?

1:06:30.292 --> 1:06:31.709
We need to see minister sir.

1:06:32.001 --> 1:06:33.917
Sir is on a tight schedule.

1:06:34.001 --> 1:06:35.417
I suggest that you call tomorrow.

1:06:35.501 --> 1:06:36.792
Forget it them.

1:06:37.167 --> 1:06:38.834
We'll meet after the blasts.

1:06:38.917 --> 1:06:39.917
Hello...

1:06:40.251 --> 1:06:42.417
Please come, I'll arrange for it.

1:06:42.834 --> 1:06:43.876
Yes.

1:06:45.602 --> 1:06:46.602
Nonsense...

1:06:46.626 --> 1:06:47.626
Yeah...

1:06:52.667 --> 1:06:53.667
Have it.

1:06:57.417 --> 1:06:58.501
Just two more minutes.

1:06:59.084 --> 1:07:00.792
The BBC people are here, so...

1:07:06.459 --> 1:07:09.917
You see, sir has managed
to create a very peaceful ambience...

1:07:10.126 --> 1:07:11.417
in the entire country.

1:07:12.292 --> 1:07:13.792
Even the opposition is stunned...

1:07:13.876 --> 1:07:15.636
about how he has got
things under control.

1:07:16.501 --> 1:07:18.334
Yes, It's only sir
who is doing everything!

1:07:19.209 --> 1:07:20.959
You seem offended.

1:07:21.584 --> 1:07:23.084
Who's going to lead the way?

1:07:23.667 --> 1:07:25.084
Who's leading the way?

1:07:25.167 --> 1:07:26.292
Face of change.

1:07:27.626 --> 1:07:29.334
Yeah, face of change? Who is it?

1:07:29.709 --> 1:07:31.876
Of course, our Minister sir.

1:07:32.584 --> 1:07:34.042
You're taunting me now.

1:07:34.417 --> 1:07:35.667
No, Mr. Gupta.

1:07:36.167 --> 1:07:41.209
In just last week alone 24 of our
officers died collectively.

1:07:41.501 --> 1:07:44.334
But people are bound to die,
that's their job.

1:08:15.209 --> 1:08:16.542
Yes, sir.

1:08:17.126 --> 1:08:18.334
Okay, sir.

1:08:18.584 --> 1:08:21.626
Sir, this is our best
chance to find Bilal.

1:08:21.876 --> 1:08:23.376
Wasim is our best lead.

1:08:23.709 --> 1:08:26.542
- When?
- In the next 24 hours, sir.

1:08:26.917 --> 1:08:28.834
How will you do it
without telling Nepal?

1:08:28.935 --> 1:08:29.935
It'll be done, sir.

1:08:29.959 --> 1:08:31.760
We don't want to make
any noise about it, sir.

1:08:33.834 --> 1:08:35.542
I can't sanction this Feroz.

1:08:36.001 --> 1:08:37.876
Sir, nothing will
be official about it.

1:08:38.167 --> 1:08:39.417
It'll be a covert operation.

1:08:39.584 --> 1:08:40.792
If something goes wrong...

1:08:41.001 --> 1:08:43.167
- we do not know Ajay.
- Yes sir.

1:08:46.001 --> 1:08:48.292
What's the plan, Feroz?
Sorry, sir.

1:08:49.126 --> 1:08:50.126
What's the plan?

1:08:50.292 --> 1:08:51.792
I heard you the first time.

1:08:51.876 --> 1:08:52.876
Sorry, sir.

1:09:02.792 --> 1:09:04.292
Excuse me, Mr. Khan.

1:09:06.084 --> 1:09:07.764
Would you like me
to serve you some snacks?

1:09:07.834 --> 1:09:09.417
No, thank you.

1:09:10.501 --> 1:09:11.584
Mrs. Khan?

1:09:12.251 --> 1:09:13.501
I'll have a glass of juice.

1:09:13.584 --> 1:09:14.876
- Thank you.
- Sure ma'am.

1:09:17.792 --> 1:09:19.334
You were snoring, sir.

1:09:21.459 --> 1:09:22.792
Stop being my wife.

1:10:08.126 --> 1:10:09.334
Welcome sir.

1:10:14.917 --> 1:10:16.209
Enjoy sir.

1:10:16.292 --> 1:10:17.459
Thank you.

1:10:48.626 --> 1:10:50.126
- Take it.
- Thank you Sir.

1:11:26.001 --> 1:11:27.834
No need to stay
more than 5 minutes.

1:11:28.251 --> 1:11:30.584
Fix a meeting for tomorrow at 11,
in this hotel.

1:11:30.792 --> 1:11:32.084
Keep it straight and simple.

1:11:32.167 --> 1:11:33.167
Okay? Good luck.

1:11:33.334 --> 1:11:34.334
Sir.

1:12:05.042 --> 1:12:07.376
- Hi Jayesh.
- How are you?

1:12:08.042 --> 1:12:09.126
I'm fine.

1:12:14.792 --> 1:12:16.417
- We are on.
- Okay sir.

1:12:17.917 --> 1:12:19.667
- Tell me.
- I'm leaving now.

1:12:20.167 --> 1:12:21.917
- Call me in the evening.
- Okay.

1:12:25.751 --> 1:12:26.876
- Sorry.
- No problem.

1:12:27.376 --> 1:12:31.001
Can you please guide
me to this address?

1:12:40.626 --> 1:12:41.959
Where are you from?

1:12:42.751 --> 1:12:44.209
Mumbai.

1:12:47.959 --> 1:12:49.001
What for?

1:12:49.792 --> 1:12:51.834
To meet Mr. Abdul Haq.

1:12:52.459 --> 1:12:54.501
One of his contacts sent me here.

1:13:01.792 --> 1:13:02.792
Come.

1:13:17.584 --> 1:13:18.876
- Sorry.
- Alright.

1:14:38.709 --> 1:14:39.709
Sit.

1:14:40.501 --> 1:14:41.751
Sit, I'll be right back.

1:15:55.626 --> 1:15:57.542
Abdul sahab is gone,
for a meeting.

1:15:58.334 --> 1:15:59.709
I've left a message for him.

1:16:01.542 --> 1:16:04.251
So... how can I help you?

1:16:05.459 --> 1:16:06.459
No.

1:16:06.834 --> 1:16:08.417
I want to talk to him.

1:16:08.876 --> 1:16:11.792
Don't worry,
lam very close to him.

1:16:13.167 --> 1:16:14.459
Who sent you?

1:16:16.167 --> 1:16:17.792
I am here on behalf of Taufiq sahab.

1:16:18.834 --> 1:16:20.751
After his martyrdom,
I was instructed...

1:16:20.834 --> 1:16:23.751
to come here and handover
a package to Mr. Abdul.

1:16:24.542 --> 1:16:25.626
Who sent you?

1:16:27.667 --> 1:16:29.001
They don't have names.

1:16:29.584 --> 1:16:30.876
I received a phone call...

1:16:30.959 --> 1:16:33.626
and next day I received
some money and tickets.

1:16:37.167 --> 1:16:38.251
Are you alone?

1:16:38.751 --> 1:16:40.126
No, Rafiq's with me.

1:16:40.667 --> 1:16:42.834
We've been sent here
posing as husband-wife.

1:16:43.667 --> 1:16:44.667
Where's the packet?

1:16:45.417 --> 1:16:46.667
At the hotel.

1:16:48.834 --> 1:16:50.501
How will you recognize Abdul sahab?

1:16:51.876 --> 1:16:53.834
He will need to speak
to someone in India.

1:16:54.584 --> 1:16:56.251
After they are reassured, I'll know...

1:16:56.334 --> 1:16:57.935
whether to handover
the packet or not.

1:16:59.876 --> 1:17:04.459
Just... send him to this
hotel tomorrow at 11.

1:17:04.643 --> 1:17:05.643
Goodbye.

1:17:05.667 --> 1:17:06.667
Wait.

1:17:08.709 --> 1:17:10.626
I'm heading that way,
I'll drop you.

1:17:11.251 --> 1:17:12.542
No, it's alright.

1:17:12.626 --> 1:17:16.251
It's not a problem.
Come on. - No, it's okay.

1:17:16.417 --> 1:17:18.042
I said it's not a problem.

1:17:18.292 --> 1:17:19.792
Come on. Let's go.

1:18:09.959 --> 1:18:11.042
Sorry.

1:18:25.084 --> 1:18:26.417
Come. I am driving.

1:19:21.667 --> 1:19:23.542
- What's your name?
- What?

1:19:24.209 --> 1:19:26.834
- Name?
- Shabana Kaif.

1:19:35.459 --> 1:19:36.459
Yes, Rafiq.

1:19:36.709 --> 1:19:37.459
What are you doing?

1:19:37.667 --> 1:19:40.667
Yeah, it's alright. Bye.

1:19:44.626 --> 1:19:45.876
Who was it?

1:19:46.959 --> 1:19:48.709
Rafiq, the guy who's come with me.

1:19:49.376 --> 1:19:50.834
He's going to the casino.

1:19:59.126 --> 1:20:00.251
Shabana.

1:20:03.501 --> 1:20:04.667
I am Abdul Haq.

1:20:04.876 --> 1:20:06.209
I will take that packet now.

1:20:08.084 --> 1:20:09.959
Imperial hotel... will you go?

1:20:10.042 --> 1:20:11.042
Bye.

1:20:13.001 --> 1:20:14.584
Come on, hurry up.

1:20:18.876 --> 1:20:21.292
Taufiq sir always said such
great things about you.

1:21:05.626 --> 1:21:07.084
Stop the car on the side.

1:21:30.084 --> 1:21:31.126
Thank you Sir.

1:21:53.876 --> 1:21:55.584
Sorry.

1:22:41.792 --> 1:22:44.792
Take a seat, I'll be right back.

1:23:12.626 --> 1:23:14.501
- Hello.
- Sir, he came along.

1:23:14.542 --> 1:23:15.542
What do I do?

1:23:15.584 --> 1:23:17.126
Keep him busy,
I'll be right there.

1:23:17.584 --> 1:23:18.626
Okay, sir.

1:24:10.751 --> 1:24:12.584
Would you like something,
Abdul sir?

1:26:59.935 --> 1:27:00.935
Search him.

1:27:00.959 --> 1:27:01.959
Yes?

1:27:03.001 --> 1:27:04.751
- Hello.
- Yes tell me.

1:27:05.209 --> 1:27:06.459
Are you in a conference?

1:27:07.167 --> 1:27:08.167
No.

1:27:08.251 --> 1:27:10.626
Tomorrow is Ananya's birthday.
Can you make it?

1:27:12.251 --> 1:27:13.251
Of course.

1:27:13.501 --> 1:27:17.251
Call home and invite
everyone on our behalf.

1:27:17.292 --> 1:27:18.334
And try to...

1:27:18.417 --> 1:27:20.834
Anjali, can I call you back?

1:27:22.584 --> 1:27:23.667
Why?

1:27:24.542 --> 1:27:25.917
I am in the middle of something.

1:27:27.334 --> 1:27:30.376
I asked you whether
you're busy or not?

1:27:30.667 --> 1:27:31.709
Sorry.

1:27:32.667 --> 1:27:34.251
That's all you always say.

1:27:34.751 --> 1:27:36.167
Call me back once you're free.

1:27:36.792 --> 1:27:37.876
Okay, bye.

1:27:44.834 --> 1:27:46.584
All he's got is money,
nothing else.

1:27:46.667 --> 1:27:47.709
No cellphone.

1:27:47.751 --> 1:27:48.751
Sir, we got him.

1:27:48.792 --> 1:27:50.417
We're bringing him back, by road.

1:27:50.501 --> 1:27:52.251
Message me the car details.

1:27:52.417 --> 1:27:55.001
Indian Air Force will help you
out at the Sanauli border.

1:27:55.167 --> 1:27:56.834
Right, sir. Thank you.

1:27:57.167 --> 1:27:58.167
Inject him.

1:27:58.251 --> 1:27:59.251
Okay sir.

1:28:50.709 --> 1:28:52.001
Where's Javed?

1:28:55.501 --> 1:28:59.542
14 Raybury Road, William Dock?

1:28:59.626 --> 1:29:01.292
Did you record it - Yes, sir.

1:29:06.292 --> 1:29:07.334
What do you think?

1:29:09.126 --> 1:29:10.292
I don't know sir.

1:29:11.584 --> 1:29:13.251
We don't have time, Ajay.

1:29:14.542 --> 1:29:15.584
I'll try.

1:29:17.209 --> 1:29:18.459
Bring me the stuff.

1:29:28.501 --> 1:29:29.501
What's this?

1:29:30.126 --> 1:29:31.126
Rod.

1:29:32.542 --> 1:29:33.542
And that?

1:29:33.667 --> 1:29:34.667
Gel.

1:29:38.542 --> 1:29:39.709
Wait. Wait.

1:29:40.209 --> 1:29:41.292
Hold on, please.

1:29:41.876 --> 1:29:44.292
Look... l am a businessman.

1:29:44.959 --> 1:29:46.560
You guys keep beating
me up all the time.

1:29:46.876 --> 1:29:48.626
First that Madam thrashed me, now you.

1:29:49.042 --> 1:29:50.792
Ask me what you want to know.

1:29:51.376 --> 1:29:52.376
Ask me.

1:29:56.292 --> 1:29:57.376
Where's Bilal?

1:29:58.209 --> 1:30:00.251
Please... please step away first.

1:30:01.042 --> 1:30:02.251
Come in front.

1:30:02.376 --> 1:30:03.376
Please.

1:30:08.376 --> 1:30:10.096
Look, you don't understand
what I am saying.

1:30:10.709 --> 1:30:11.834
I am a businessman.

1:30:12.042 --> 1:30:13.501
We only work for money.

1:30:15.876 --> 1:30:17.167
Where's Bilal?

1:30:20.751 --> 1:30:23.626
First... promise you'll set me free.

1:30:24.542 --> 1:30:26.459
Look, I've got nothing to do...

1:30:26.667 --> 1:30:29.001
with this India-Pakistan
or Hindu-Muslim war...

1:30:29.334 --> 1:30:31.626
I only give
service and make money.

1:30:32.251 --> 1:30:33.891
And I can be useful
to you in future also.

1:30:33.917 --> 1:30:34.917
You see...

1:30:45.084 --> 1:30:46.084
Okay.

1:30:48.084 --> 1:30:49.167
Bilal is in Al-Dera.

1:30:49.834 --> 1:30:51.251
He's got a big meeting tomorrow.

1:30:51.709 --> 1:30:53.417
To finalize the
rest of the planning...

1:30:53.626 --> 1:30:54.876
and also funding.

1:30:56.334 --> 1:30:57.501
What are they planning next?

1:30:57.709 --> 1:31:00.292
What are your big plans?
I don't make plans.

1:31:00.876 --> 1:31:02.834
They do all that, I am just...

1:31:02.917 --> 1:31:04.667
- A businessman.
- Yes.

1:31:05.126 --> 1:31:06.334
What are they thinking?

1:31:07.702 --> 1:31:09.102
Have you heard of Jumbo Jet room...

1:31:09.126 --> 1:31:10.542
and Nanhe Mujahid?

1:31:12.459 --> 1:31:14.709
They will be carrying
out the rest of the plan.

1:31:24.376 --> 1:31:26.376
I just wrote it down...

1:31:28.292 --> 1:31:29.417
Hold on.

1:31:31.209 --> 1:31:32.709
Yes, Mr. Feroz sir.

1:31:33.001 --> 1:31:34.917
I need to see sir?

1:31:35.376 --> 1:31:37.292
Sir is on a very tight schedule.

1:31:37.417 --> 1:31:39.542
I suggest that...- Mr. Gupta!

1:31:40.501 --> 1:31:41.542
Yes.

1:31:42.376 --> 1:31:44.584
Come. I'll arrange for it.

1:31:45.459 --> 1:31:46.459
Yes.

1:31:47.626 --> 1:31:48.709
Mr. Gupta.

1:31:55.584 --> 1:31:57.334
I don't know anything more.

1:32:05.459 --> 1:32:06.459
Yes.

1:32:13.042 --> 1:32:14.501
I told you everything.

1:32:15.584 --> 1:32:16.792
Why did you hit me?

1:32:17.251 --> 1:32:18.251
Out of habit.

1:32:41.709 --> 1:32:43.126
Yes, sir.

1:32:43.209 --> 1:32:44.292
We have to go with it.

1:32:44.417 --> 1:32:45.417
Sir.

1:32:45.667 --> 1:32:47.001
I'll call you back.

1:32:48.584 --> 1:32:50.876
- Afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

1:32:51.209 --> 1:32:52.251
Good afternoon sir.

1:32:55.584 --> 1:32:58.126
Sir, we've found about Bilal Khan.

1:32:59.334 --> 1:33:01.214
And according to me,
the story goes like this...

1:33:01.959 --> 1:33:04.417
Indian Mujahideen and Lashkar...

1:33:04.584 --> 1:33:05.984
were jointly planning an attack.

1:33:06.126 --> 1:33:08.126
But suddenly Bilal
Khan got apprehended.

1:33:08.751 --> 1:33:11.626
Lashkar's leaders still
Wanted to execute the plan.

1:33:11.917 --> 1:33:15.542
But IM wanted to
free Bilal Khan first.

1:33:15.709 --> 1:33:19.209
So... Wasim mobilizes
funds from Nepal.

1:33:19.501 --> 1:33:21.751
Javed comes down to
India from Pakistan.

1:33:22.042 --> 1:33:26.001
And with his help,
Bilal Khan escapes.

1:33:26.584 --> 1:33:28.542
But the threat still looms, sir.

1:33:29.542 --> 1:33:31.334
Now if we want to stop them...

1:33:31.709 --> 1:33:34.334
we'll need to stop Bilal Khan?

1:33:34.542 --> 1:33:35.751
What were they planning?

1:33:35.959 --> 1:33:37.501
We've intel that Bilal Khan...

1:33:38.042 --> 1:33:41.417
will activate a unit of
Lashkar's Jumbo Jet Room.

1:33:41.584 --> 1:33:43.001
Tell me more on this.

1:33:43.251 --> 1:33:46.792
Sir, Jumbo Jet Room is
Lashkar's aerial attack unit...

1:33:46.959 --> 1:33:48.501
and it's based in Karachi.

1:33:48.959 --> 1:33:50.959
There are about 150 men in this unit.

1:33:51.209 --> 1:33:54.959
Pilots, mercenaries,
para-troopers... and what not.

1:33:55.167 --> 1:34:00.042
They can attack in any form right
from 9/11 to fedayeen type attacks.

1:34:00.501 --> 1:34:01.709
Ajay, will you?

1:34:01.876 --> 1:34:03.876
Sir, our ex-officer Jamal,
warned me...

1:34:04.209 --> 1:34:07.084
that this year there is
going to be lot of fireworks.

1:34:07.501 --> 1:34:10.834
Jamad-Ud-Dawa publishes
a fortnightly magazine, for kids.

1:34:10.959 --> 1:34:11.959
Nanhe Mujahid.

1:34:12.209 --> 1:34:13.751
Pakistan has banned it.

1:34:14.334 --> 1:34:17.084
We just learned that Nanhe
Mujahid is being upgraded.

1:34:17.334 --> 1:34:19.126
It'll be a
independent militant wing.

1:34:19.209 --> 1:34:20.876
Sir, Bilal's in Al-Dera right now.

1:34:20.959 --> 1:34:22.751
To plan the funding and chock out
the future plans for both the groups.

1:34:22.917 --> 1:34:26.709
Then he'll head straight to Karachi
and try to execute his plans.

1:34:27.167 --> 1:34:29.667
They'll carry out aerial
attacks on a large scale.

1:34:29.751 --> 1:34:31.876
Target in all
probability-Delhi or Mumbai.

1:34:31.959 --> 1:34:32.959
Or maybe both.

1:34:33.876 --> 1:34:34.876
So now?

1:34:35.126 --> 1:34:38.001
Sir, we have caught 3 of their
most important men in last 2 days.

1:34:38.209 --> 1:34:40.501
We've confirmed intel
about Bilal as well.

1:34:40.751 --> 1:34:43.084
If we get Bilal,
then that will be a big blow to them.

1:34:43.459 --> 1:34:44.626
Get Bilal means?

1:34:44.709 --> 1:34:45.792
Eliminate!

1:34:46.126 --> 1:34:49.917
After killing Bilal,
will bring Wasim before the media.

1:34:50.126 --> 1:34:51.626
The message will be loud and clear.

1:34:51.834 --> 1:34:54.475
That we're not behind them, in fact,
we're two steps ahead of them.

1:34:54.626 --> 1:34:56.251
This is a big opportunity, sir.

1:34:56.459 --> 1:34:57.859
And I don't think
we should miss it.

1:34:59.084 --> 1:35:02.292
Where is Bilal?
He's in Saudi AIDera, sir.

1:35:02.334 --> 1:35:03.334
What?

1:35:04.209 --> 1:35:06.084
Are you out of your mind, Feroz?

1:35:06.626 --> 1:35:08.751
I mean who do you
think you are? The Mossads?

1:35:09.126 --> 1:35:10.459
The idea has merit, sir.

1:35:10.751 --> 1:35:12.167
First Nepal and now this.

1:35:12.501 --> 1:35:15.001
Sir, Nepal was an extremely
successful operation.

1:35:15.209 --> 1:35:17.084
But Saudi Al-Dera?

1:35:17.709 --> 1:35:19.229
Feroz, you don't need
me to tell you...

1:35:19.251 --> 1:35:21.126
that this is a very dumb idea.

1:35:21.251 --> 1:35:24.126
It's risky,
sir, but it's not a dumb idea.

1:35:24.751 --> 1:35:26.584
We've a deep
asset in Saudi Al-Dera.

1:35:26.917 --> 1:35:30.417
And with his help,
this idea is definitely possible.

1:35:31.459 --> 1:35:32.876
What are the percentages?

1:35:32.959 --> 1:35:33.834
Five percent, sir.

1:35:33.917 --> 1:35:35.084
It's a great percentage.

1:35:35.167 --> 1:35:36.667
I even go on one percent.

1:35:37.876 --> 1:35:40.126
No, Feroz. I cannot sanction this.

1:35:40.209 --> 1:35:41.251
Sir, just like Nepal...

1:35:41.334 --> 1:35:43.054
this will be a covert
operation, as well.

1:35:43.435 --> 1:35:44.435
Nothing...

1:35:44.459 --> 1:35:46.209
I repeat nothing will be official.

1:35:46.292 --> 1:35:47.667
Even internally.

1:35:48.542 --> 1:35:49.834
If something goes wrong...

1:35:49.917 --> 1:35:52.709
If something happens to Ajay then,
we do not know him.

1:35:54.959 --> 1:35:56.501
Can I talk to you in private?

1:35:57.501 --> 1:35:58.584
Excuse me.

1:36:04.834 --> 1:36:08.126
When you keep saying
in front of this officer...

1:36:08.501 --> 1:36:12.001
that if anything goes wrong,
we will disown him...

1:36:12.709 --> 1:36:14.459
how much of it do you really mean?

1:36:14.667 --> 1:36:15.959
I mean it fully, sir.

1:36:36.917 --> 1:36:37.917
I am sorry.

1:36:41.667 --> 1:36:46.626
We get some officers like him,
bit crazy... and stubborn.

1:36:47.626 --> 1:36:50.542
And all that they care about
is their nation and patriotism.

1:36:51.167 --> 1:36:52.834
They don't want to
die for their country.

1:36:53.376 --> 1:36:55.056
In fact, they want
to live for the country.

1:36:55.126 --> 1:36:58.167
So that they can protect
it until their last breath.

1:37:00.084 --> 1:37:01.709
And are we doing enough for them?

1:37:03.501 --> 1:37:04.626
No, sir.

1:37:06.834 --> 1:37:08.084
But the fact is...

1:37:09.126 --> 1:37:10.251
they don't even care.

1:37:19.542 --> 1:37:20.917
How many men do you need?

1:37:21.001 --> 1:37:22.917
One backup and a technician.

1:37:23.292 --> 1:37:24.292
Take Shukla.

1:37:25.626 --> 1:37:27.001
Sir why are you doing this to me?

1:37:33.915 --> 1:37:35.435
How many hours do
you spend in the gym?

1:37:35.459 --> 1:37:36.542
Daily four hours, sir?

1:37:37.126 --> 1:37:39.126
- Try you do Sudoku?
- No, sir.

1:37:39.917 --> 1:37:41.542
Try Sudoku for 30 minutes a day.

1:37:44.667 --> 1:37:45.917
I talked to him, sir.

1:37:46.167 --> 1:37:47.376
He said...

1:37:47.584 --> 1:37:48.626
- Good evening.
- Mr. Shukla's here.

1:37:48.834 --> 1:37:50.292
- Hello sir.
- Good evening, sir.

1:37:50.626 --> 1:37:51.792
Evening, Shukla.

1:37:52.751 --> 1:37:54.751
Sir, I don't want
to work with this man.

1:37:55.209 --> 1:37:57.459
Stop crabbing Shukla.

1:37:57.584 --> 1:38:00.417
No, sir.
I don't want to work with him.

1:38:00.709 --> 1:38:02.084
He always gets me in a tight spot.

1:38:02.417 --> 1:38:03.959
He's a reckless man.

1:38:04.376 --> 1:38:07.501
I barely escaped death
in Bangladesh and Iran.

1:38:07.584 --> 1:38:09.292
It was me who saved your life.

1:38:09.459 --> 1:38:10.876
It was you who
got me in that spot?

1:38:11.209 --> 1:38:13.167
He changes the entire
plan at the last minute.

1:38:13.251 --> 1:38:14.626
And sc*** the entire mission.

1:38:14.792 --> 1:38:15.792
I am sorry, sir.

1:38:16.042 --> 1:38:17.917
It's call improvisation,
Mr. Shukla.

1:38:18.167 --> 1:38:19.167
I see.

1:38:19.459 --> 1:38:20.626
Fine, I won't do it.

1:38:21.251 --> 1:38:23.084
No, sir.
I don't want to work with him.

1:38:24.084 --> 1:38:26.001
Fine, sir.
Jai and I will handle this.

1:38:30.334 --> 1:38:33.417
Tarzan and Hulk will
handle this operation jointly.

1:38:33.709 --> 1:38:35.084
God save the country.

1:38:35.751 --> 1:38:37.917
- Enough, Shukla.
- No, sir.

1:38:38.667 --> 1:38:40.209
I don't want to work with him.

1:38:42.876 --> 1:38:45.709
Ladies and gentlemen,
on behalf of the crew...

1:38:45.792 --> 1:38:49.251
I ask that you please direct
your attention to the monitor above...

1:38:49.334 --> 1:38:51.876
as we review the
emergency procedures.

1:38:51.959 --> 1:38:54.834
There are six emergency
exits on this aircraft.

1:38:55.167 --> 1:38:58.292
Take a minute to locate
the exit closet to you.

1:39:05.292 --> 1:39:07.876
Our first job
was to provide a cover...

1:39:08.167 --> 1:39:09.728
and create a
background for our team.

1:39:09.792 --> 1:39:12.917
We floated a Gujarat
based oil company overnight.

1:39:13.251 --> 1:39:15.209
And gave it 15 years of history.

1:39:15.792 --> 1:39:17.584
We even gave a background...

1:39:17.751 --> 1:39:19.271
to three of
the company's employees.

1:39:19.584 --> 1:39:22.001
Then in a fake mail trail...

1:39:22.126 --> 1:39:23.709
we fixed an
urgent meeting between...

1:39:23.792 --> 1:39:26.792
our Indian company
and Saudi Al-Dera company.

1:39:27.042 --> 1:39:30.417
The Al-Dera company belonged
to our deep asset, Ashfaq.

1:39:36.042 --> 1:39:38.001
Ashfaq was groomed by Ajay.

1:39:38.876 --> 1:39:41.459
Ashfaq was in
Al-Dera for four years.

1:39:42.334 --> 1:39:44.751
We helped him setup his business.

1:39:45.292 --> 1:39:48.626
Ashfaq's job was to provide
us with local support.

1:39:48.876 --> 1:39:50.501
He was very reliable.

1:39:51.209 --> 1:39:52.876
He had also been
arrested a few times.

1:39:53.042 --> 1:39:55.751
But every time he would
get bail inside of an hour.

1:39:56.501 --> 1:39:58.001
He knew something really bad...

1:39:58.084 --> 1:40:00.001
about someone really important.

1:40:00.834 --> 1:40:04.751
We knew more about
Al-Dera than America.

1:40:06.584 --> 1:40:08.334
Where is all our stuff?

1:40:08.626 --> 1:40:09.834
It's in the bags.

1:40:09.917 --> 1:40:11.001
Everything.

1:40:11.792 --> 1:40:13.001
More than everything.

1:40:13.751 --> 1:40:16.667
Bilal's staying in a
desert resort. In the villa section.

1:40:16.876 --> 1:40:18.501
Under the name of Firdaus Ali.

1:40:18.834 --> 1:40:21.167
You're all booked in
room in the other wing.

1:40:21.334 --> 1:40:22.917
The other details are in the bag.

1:40:24.084 --> 1:40:25.376
Just keep looking down.

1:40:25.459 --> 1:40:27.834
And avoid the CCTV camera
as much as you can.

1:41:13.834 --> 1:41:16.709
According to Wasim, Bilal's meeting
was scheduled on the same evening.

1:41:17.584 --> 1:41:22.167
So we decided... that they will
kill Bilal the same night...

1:41:22.251 --> 1:41:24.001
and leave for the
airport immediately.

1:41:25.001 --> 1:41:28.959
Their return flight was scheduled
for next morning, at 5:30 a.m.

1:41:49.876 --> 1:41:50.876
- Enjoy sir.
- Thank you.

1:41:50.959 --> 1:41:52.042
- Thank you.
- Thank you sir.

1:41:55.143 --> 1:41:56.143
- Vijay.
- Thanks.

1:41:56.167 --> 1:41:56.959
Brijmohan.

1:41:57.042 --> 1:41:58.042
RahuL.

1:41:58.167 --> 1:41:59.167
Good luck.

1:42:06.001 --> 1:42:07.001
Here.

1:43:08.792 --> 1:43:10.251
What's the plan, Mr. Shukla?

1:43:11.667 --> 1:43:13.187
Bilal's been given very high security.

1:43:13.417 --> 1:43:15.917
From the main entrance
to the individual villa.

1:43:16.126 --> 1:43:17.917
46&47 is highly guarded.

1:43:18.001 --> 1:43:19.626
It means, whoever Bilal's meeting...

1:43:19.751 --> 1:43:21.459
is staying in 47.

1:43:21.959 --> 1:43:22.959
It's not allowed.

1:43:23.042 --> 1:43:24.562
Don't take pictures, it's not allowed.

1:43:24.584 --> 1:43:26.126
- Okay.
- Not allowed.

1:43:27.667 --> 1:43:30.042
I hacked into the hotel reservations.

1:43:30.126 --> 1:43:32.834
He's meeting someone
by the name of Abbas Sheikh.

1:43:33.834 --> 1:43:35.334
What's the plan, Mr. Shukla?

1:43:36.126 --> 1:43:37.126
Do you have any patience?

1:43:38.209 --> 1:43:40.289
Of course I have patience which is
why you are alive.

1:43:41.459 --> 1:43:42.459
Good.

1:43:42.626 --> 1:43:44.334
We're going to keep
it extremely simple.

1:43:44.751 --> 1:43:46.334
We'll enter from the desert.

1:43:46.709 --> 1:43:48.667
Wasim said that
they're meeting at 8.

1:43:48.959 --> 1:43:50.626
We'll wait for their
meeting to get over.

1:43:50.709 --> 1:43:53.709
And exactly an hour
later... you guys scale this wall...

1:43:53.792 --> 1:43:57.376
and cross this lawn or terrace,
and enter Bilal's room.

1:43:57.459 --> 1:43:58.209
And kill him.

1:43:58.459 --> 1:44:01.501
Next, you two will come
back the same way you went in.

1:44:01.584 --> 1:44:02.917
We'll head back to the airport,
catch the flight...

1:44:03.001 --> 1:44:04.292
and head back to India.

1:44:05.167 --> 1:44:07.626
What's the height of this wall?
18 feet.

1:44:08.959 --> 1:44:10.084
You'll need to climb it.

1:44:10.167 --> 1:44:11.626
But you guys can manage.

1:44:12.959 --> 1:44:14.126
CCTV?

1:44:14.917 --> 1:44:16.459
Digital... hackable.

1:44:16.667 --> 1:44:19.001
That's not the problem?
Then, what's the problem?

1:44:19.376 --> 1:44:20.459
From the desert side...

1:44:20.542 --> 1:44:22.902
you will first come across
a 9 feet electrical parameter.

1:44:22.959 --> 1:44:24.376
The wall comes 30 feet later.

1:44:24.667 --> 1:44:26.667
I'll give you a three minute window.

1:44:26.751 --> 1:44:28.501
All the CCTV cameras will be off.

1:44:28.917 --> 1:44:31.437
And the power-supply to the
electric fence will be disconnected.

1:44:32.084 --> 1:44:36.292
Mr. Shukla, you want us to
climb a 18 feet wall...

1:44:36.376 --> 1:44:40.292
and cross the terrace or balcony,
cross the bedroom...

1:44:40.376 --> 1:44:45.917
find Bilal, kill him and then come
out... cross the balcony or terrace...

1:44:46.001 --> 1:44:47.921
and jump down a 18
feet wall in three minutes.

1:44:48.334 --> 1:44:50.334
We're not as fit as you are,
Mr. Shukla.

1:44:52.459 --> 1:44:54.376
Sarcasm? Huh?

1:44:55.751 --> 1:44:57.459
Fine, I'll give you four.

1:44:59.334 --> 1:45:01.292
We'll check out at 7pm.

1:45:02.292 --> 1:45:03.292
Okay sir.

1:46:49.542 --> 1:46:50.542
Good luck.

1:47:32.042 --> 1:47:33.084
We've reached.

1:47:34.501 --> 1:47:36.251
Good. Now relax.

1:49:10.209 --> 1:49:12.042
Enough already, finish it.

1:49:24.876 --> 1:49:26.751
Are you going to
plan everything today?

1:49:26.959 --> 1:49:28.584
You'll be dead soon.

1:49:34.876 --> 1:49:37.792
Friends,
they're sitting down for a meal.

1:50:14.709 --> 1:50:16.209
Now they're going to have tea.

1:50:16.459 --> 1:50:18.042
We've to catch a flight.

1:50:21.167 --> 1:50:22.292
Good evening, sir.

1:50:22.417 --> 1:50:24.709
- Any update?
- No, sir. No update yet.

1:50:25.209 --> 1:50:26.751
It's too late,
I think we should abort.

1:50:27.209 --> 1:50:28.209
Patch me.

1:50:30.852 --> 1:50:31.852
What do we do?

1:50:31.876 --> 1:50:34.334
Sir, we'll wait.
Sir, we'll miss our flight.

1:50:34.417 --> 1:50:36.334
If we stay,
and our cover will be blown.

1:50:36.417 --> 1:50:37.251
Sir, we'll wait.

1:50:37.417 --> 1:50:38.834
Sir, when their
meeting is going to end...

1:50:38.917 --> 1:50:40.334
when will they
go to sleep, and when?

1:50:40.417 --> 1:50:41.917
We have to do it someplace else, sir.

1:50:42.001 --> 1:50:43.251
Let's wait for a while, sir.

1:50:43.709 --> 1:50:44.834
There he goes again, sir.

1:50:44.917 --> 1:50:46.709
I told you... l mean...

1:50:46.917 --> 1:50:49.834
Shukla, we'll wait
for 10 more minutes.

1:50:50.001 --> 1:50:51.167
- Bye.
- Yes sir.

1:50:52.251 --> 1:50:54.292
I knew this would happen.

1:50:54.376 --> 1:50:56.459
Working with you, means sc***

1:51:02.626 --> 1:51:03.626
What happened?

1:51:07.376 --> 1:51:08.542
The meeting's finished.

1:51:08.751 --> 1:51:09.792
We can still do this.

1:51:09.876 --> 1:51:11.834
Mr. Shukla,
we won't wait for them to sleep.

1:51:11.959 --> 1:51:14.334
As soon as Bilal's guests leave,
the room and he's alone...

1:51:14.417 --> 1:51:15.417
we'll go in.

1:51:15.501 --> 1:51:17.042
No, Ajay. No.

1:51:17.209 --> 1:51:19.251
- Ajay please come back.
- Come on.

1:51:19.584 --> 1:51:21.001
Mr. Shukla, we've started walking.

1:51:21.834 --> 1:51:22.959
The rest is in your hands.

1:51:23.042 --> 1:51:25.417
This is exactly why I don't
want to work with him.

1:52:13.834 --> 1:52:15.001
Oh no.

1:52:39.577 --> 1:52:40.977
Someone switched the power back on.

1:52:41.001 --> 1:52:42.802
Don't shut it off now,
they'll get suspicious.

1:55:54.042 --> 1:55:55.667
Sir, it's Maulana..

1:55:56.459 --> 1:55:57.459
Oh no!

1:56:51.084 --> 1:56:52.626
That mean bilal came
here to meet him.

1:56:54.126 --> 1:56:55.667
- Guys, all okay?
- Yeah, okay.

1:56:55.751 --> 1:56:56.917
Job done, we're on our way.

1:56:57.001 --> 1:56:58.626
Good, hurry up.

1:56:59.667 --> 1:57:02.334
- Let's take him along.
- But, sir...

1:57:06.251 --> 1:57:07.542
Shall we tell Shukla sir?

1:57:07.672 --> 1:57:09.352
If we tell him,
he will never disconnect...

1:57:09.376 --> 1:57:11.016
the power-supply
of the electric fence.

1:57:11.542 --> 1:57:13.126
He won't let us out.

1:57:14.792 --> 1:57:16.084
- Search him.
- Okay sir.

1:57:19.251 --> 1:57:21.751
You know, I was saying...

1:57:21.834 --> 1:57:22.834
See...

1:57:23.251 --> 1:57:24.751
He's already asleep.

1:57:47.792 --> 1:57:49.334
Disconnect the power.

1:57:50.626 --> 1:57:51.626
Power off.

1:58:48.126 --> 1:58:49.376
Sir, he's gone crazy.

1:58:49.626 --> 1:58:51.376
He found the Maulana,
but didn't kill him.

1:58:51.542 --> 1:58:52.876
In fact, he brought him along.

1:58:53.334 --> 1:58:55.214
And now he's insisting
on bringing him to India.

1:58:55.251 --> 1:58:57.917
Sir, please tell him to
get rid of him and finish this.

1:58:58.501 --> 1:58:59.584
Give the phone to Ajay.

1:58:59.917 --> 1:59:00.917
Okay, sir.

1:59:01.126 --> 1:59:02.334
- Shukla.
- Talk to him.

1:59:03.376 --> 1:59:04.376
Sir.

1:59:04.501 --> 1:59:06.334
- Are you sure it's him?
- Yes sir.

1:59:07.542 --> 1:59:08.542
What have you thought?

1:59:08.667 --> 1:59:10.292
We could've spent
all our lives, but...

1:59:10.376 --> 1:59:11.751
never got our hands on him.

1:59:11.917 --> 1:59:12.917
Sir, he knows a lot.

1:59:13.001 --> 1:59:14.042
This is the mother lode.

1:59:14.126 --> 1:59:16.334
We need to get him
to India at any cost.

1:59:16.876 --> 1:59:19.542
But how?
I don't know, I need some time.

1:59:19.584 --> 1:59:21.064
These two will be leaving as planned.

1:59:21.126 --> 1:59:22.417
I'll contact you again.

1:59:22.501 --> 1:59:23.709
But...- He's right, sir.

1:59:23.792 --> 1:59:24.792
Jai and I are leaving.

1:59:25.042 --> 1:59:27.251
If he wants to stay here with his
new friend, then that's his decision.

1:59:27.792 --> 1:59:31.376
Ajay, if we can get him...

1:59:31.459 --> 1:59:32.626
Sir, I'll try my best.

1:59:32.876 --> 1:59:35.667
This is going to be
our biggest success, Ajay.

1:59:35.751 --> 1:59:36.751
Yes sir.

1:59:36.834 --> 1:59:37.834
Come on, guys, let's go.

1:59:45.584 --> 1:59:46.626
Oh no!

2:00:25.417 --> 2:00:26.917
Okay, bye.

2:00:27.626 --> 2:00:29.042
Sir, I want to stay.

2:00:30.126 --> 2:00:31.417
Jai, just go get lost.

2:00:31.501 --> 2:00:33.001
No, sir. I'll stay.

2:00:33.459 --> 2:00:34.751
Just go.

2:00:35.709 --> 2:00:37.084
He's right for a change.

2:00:37.667 --> 2:00:39.292
Sir, please... I'll stay.

2:00:39.501 --> 2:00:41.084
- Jai, just go now.
- No, sir.

2:00:41.167 --> 2:00:42.001
I am not leaving.

2:00:42.084 --> 2:00:43.542
I'm not leaving alone you like this.

2:00:46.209 --> 2:00:47.709
Look how you spoiled him.

2:00:47.917 --> 2:00:49.459
Now he's going to die here with you.

2:00:51.959 --> 2:00:53.209
You can leave.

2:00:56.584 --> 2:00:59.167
Okay, guys... have fun!

2:01:16.584 --> 2:01:18.751
I said I didn't want to work with you.

2:01:19.126 --> 2:01:20.626
Now I am stuck in this too.

2:01:20.959 --> 2:01:22.167
Why? What's wrong?

2:01:24.001 --> 2:01:25.792
This isn't Hulk and
Tarzan's cup of tea.

2:01:26.126 --> 2:01:27.626
You will need me.

2:01:27.834 --> 2:01:28.834
Let's go.

2:01:54.209 --> 2:01:55.376
- Hello.
- Yes Ajay.

2:01:56.209 --> 2:01:57.626
Ashfaq there is a situation.

2:02:53.209 --> 2:02:54.209
F*** man.

2:02:54.459 --> 2:02:55.917
He'll look even poorer.

2:02:56.209 --> 2:02:57.876
He'll look pitiable now.

2:02:58.542 --> 2:03:00.667
Jai, get the razor and get started.
Okay.

2:03:02.084 --> 2:03:03.334
Any plans, Mr. Shukla?

2:03:03.751 --> 2:03:05.001
Can I get a cup of tea?

2:03:05.334 --> 2:03:06.501
I have a headache.

2:03:06.709 --> 2:03:08.417
And after tea I need to go.

2:03:08.959 --> 2:03:10.417
Do you have a loo or not?

2:03:30.751 --> 2:03:33.751
Greetings,
I am from house-keeping. - Wait.

2:03:34.459 --> 2:03:35.876
Come after half an hour.

2:03:43.417 --> 2:03:45.501
Ashfaq, we'll take
the 6 o'clock flight.

2:03:46.167 --> 2:03:47.501
But how will you get out of here?

2:03:48.001 --> 2:03:49.042
Well...

2:03:50.084 --> 2:03:51.292
Medical tourism.

2:03:52.334 --> 2:03:53.792
Ashfaq, you'll have to come with us.

2:03:53.876 --> 2:03:55.709
We'll need a local resident.

2:03:55.751 --> 2:03:57.084
What's the plan, Mr. Shukla?

2:03:57.542 --> 2:03:58.542
Patience.

2:03:59.751 --> 2:04:02.584
Ashfaq, imagine that you've a uncle.

2:04:02.959 --> 2:04:05.417
And your uncle's been
sick for a long time.

2:04:05.751 --> 2:04:07.584
You applied in
a hospital in Chennai...

2:04:07.667 --> 2:04:09.147
but your application's in a queue.

2:04:09.584 --> 2:04:12.292
Suddenly your uncle's
condition gets critical today.

2:04:12.376 --> 2:04:15.334
And coincidentally... you receive
a mail from a Chennai Hospital...

2:04:15.417 --> 2:04:16.584
that the donor's ready.

2:04:16.667 --> 2:04:20.084
Bring your patient,
we'll give him a last minute entry.

2:04:20.376 --> 2:04:21.792
We will have to cover and create...

2:04:21.876 --> 2:04:23.376
lot of fake paper trail.

2:04:23.501 --> 2:04:24.822
But that's the only way possible.

2:04:27.876 --> 2:04:29.209
Ashfaq.

2:04:31.876 --> 2:04:33.459
You're really good, man.

2:04:33.667 --> 2:04:36.042
On some days... I'm even better.

2:04:37.001 --> 2:04:38.417
Just one problem.

2:04:38.959 --> 2:04:40.209
My uncle's visa.

2:04:40.292 --> 2:04:41.334
That will be done.

2:04:41.584 --> 2:04:43.042
Mr. Shukla, you don't understand.

2:04:43.626 --> 2:04:45.126
Even if I manage to get a visa...

2:04:45.459 --> 2:04:48.001
my uncle would need a
health inspection for his visa,

2:04:48.292 --> 2:04:49.751
From the local civic authorities.

2:04:50.376 --> 2:04:52.126
First, the uncle will have
to go through a health inspection.

2:04:52.376 --> 2:04:53.896
The health inspector will examine him.

2:04:54.084 --> 2:04:55.604
Next he'll give his
approval on a form.

2:04:55.709 --> 2:04:57.334
Only then will he get the visa.

2:04:57.709 --> 2:04:59.876
And at the airport,
right from the check-in...

2:05:00.167 --> 2:05:04.251
to paramedics, this form
will be checked at every point.

2:05:04.417 --> 2:05:06.334
You mean we'll have
to admit him in a hospital.

2:05:06.501 --> 2:05:07.501
Yes.

2:05:07.667 --> 2:05:10.459
But we won't know who they
will be sending from the Civic.

2:05:10.498 --> 2:05:12.018
The embassy can call it
an emergency...

2:05:12.042 --> 2:05:13.334
and make it a priority case.

2:05:13.542 --> 2:05:15.709
But they cannot control
who comes from the Civic.

2:05:17.459 --> 2:05:20.542
Can your doctor make
a backdated case history?

2:05:20.626 --> 2:05:22.917
Yes. I can manage
the hospital and the doctor.

2:05:23.334 --> 2:05:25.292
Fine, make it fool-proof.

2:05:25.477 --> 2:05:26.477
It should be a busy hospital...

2:05:26.501 --> 2:05:27.741
and make it the corner room.

2:05:27.959 --> 2:05:29.209
We'll handle the rest.

2:05:29.834 --> 2:05:30.834
Are you sure?

2:05:31.626 --> 2:05:33.626
Because If we caught
in his health inspection...

2:05:33.959 --> 2:05:35.417
then there's a square in Dera.

2:05:35.792 --> 2:05:37.834
People call it the Chop-Chop Square.

2:05:38.417 --> 2:05:40.126
Public executions
are carried out there.

2:05:40.501 --> 2:05:43.167
And we'll be...
Mr. Shukla, start your work.

2:05:43.251 --> 2:05:45.292
What's this about a Chop-Chop Square?

2:05:45.542 --> 2:05:46.626
Nothing, he's just joking.

2:05:46.792 --> 2:05:48.667
Tell him I don't like such jokes.

2:05:49.126 --> 2:05:50.126
Okay.

2:05:50.626 --> 2:05:51.751
Chop-Chop Square.

2:05:52.126 --> 2:05:53.251
I said he'll get me...

2:06:03.667 --> 2:06:04.667
Yes, Shukla.

2:06:04.709 --> 2:06:06.376
Sir, we need visas for India.

2:06:07.001 --> 2:06:08.792
And we'll also require lots of cash.

2:06:09.042 --> 2:06:11.001
I'll text you a name and number.

2:06:11.459 --> 2:06:12.751
He'll take care of everything.

2:06:12.834 --> 2:06:13.917
No questions asked.

2:06:13.959 --> 2:06:14.959
Okay, sir.

2:06:15.251 --> 2:06:16.542
Good you stayed, Shukla.

2:06:17.709 --> 2:06:18.709
Bye, sir.

2:06:21.126 --> 2:06:23.501
Mr. Mathur, how are you?

2:06:25.209 --> 2:06:26.292
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

2:06:26.376 --> 2:06:28.251
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

2:06:28.334 --> 2:06:30.126
Why isn't Bilal came outside.

2:06:39.001 --> 2:06:40.521
How long since anyone opened the door?

2:06:40.542 --> 2:06:42.417
It's been 8 hours.

2:06:47.376 --> 2:06:48.542
Sir!

2:06:50.792 --> 2:06:51.917
Sir!

2:06:53.959 --> 2:06:55.251
Sir!

2:06:57.542 --> 2:06:58.834
Sir!

2:07:00.501 --> 2:07:01.626
Housekeeping!

2:07:05.834 --> 2:07:06.994
Yes, sir. How may I help you?

2:07:07.042 --> 2:07:08.084
Please unlock the door.

2:07:08.584 --> 2:07:09.584
Sure sir.

2:07:10.251 --> 2:07:11.251
Please.

2:07:12.584 --> 2:07:13.584
Bilal sir.

2:07:15.459 --> 2:07:17.042
Bilal sir, where are you?

2:07:19.292 --> 2:07:20.584
Sir.

2:07:27.709 --> 2:07:29.001
Sir where are you?

2:07:36.917 --> 2:07:38.167
Bilal sir...

2:08:27.001 --> 2:08:29.876
Dear Viewers I'm
at the murder scene...

2:08:29.917 --> 2:08:35.042
where a male dead body was found...
his age is around 43 years...

2:08:35.084 --> 2:08:37.584
and his name is
reportedly mentioned...

2:08:37.667 --> 2:08:40.209
as Bilal Khan,
he was killed by gun shots.

2:08:40.292 --> 2:08:44.292
No authority has
announced any details regarding.

2:08:44.376 --> 2:08:48.084
Once we get the details
we will let you know.

2:09:28.376 --> 2:09:29.751
- All right.
- Thank you.

2:09:29.792 --> 2:09:30.501
Thank you.

2:09:30.751 --> 2:09:31.751
Come.

2:09:33.417 --> 2:09:34.501
Hello, sir.

2:09:34.626 --> 2:09:36.042
Serious medical condition.

2:09:36.126 --> 2:09:38.086
We need to travel to
India for a liver transplant.

2:09:43.626 --> 2:09:44.917
Okay, sit down.

2:10:06.667 --> 2:10:07.834
Greeting sir.

2:10:08.417 --> 2:10:09.459
Come here.

2:10:48.747 --> 2:10:50.227
There's a someone outside who says...

2:10:50.251 --> 2:10:52.126
that the gentlemen in
the adjoining room is missing.

2:10:52.209 --> 2:10:53.417
This is his passport.

2:10:55.084 --> 2:10:57.251
I want passport copies
of all the guests...

2:10:57.334 --> 2:10:59.959
who checked-in or checked-out
in the last 48 hours.

2:11:00.001 --> 2:11:02.584
And what is the status
on the CCTV footage?

2:11:02.667 --> 2:11:05.167
The seven cameras stopped
recording yesterday at 8:30.

2:11:08.042 --> 2:11:11.542
He isn't Abbas Sheikh,
nor is he from Kuwait.

2:11:12.334 --> 2:11:13.626
Check our database.

2:11:15.167 --> 2:11:18.459
We had three may be four unwanted
guests here yesterday.

2:11:18.501 --> 2:11:19.501
- Sir.
- Sir.

2:11:36.501 --> 2:11:38.417
Be careful... Be careful...

2:11:38.643 --> 2:11:39.643
Ashfaq.

2:11:39.667 --> 2:11:41.751
The inspector's reaching
the hospital at 3 pm.

2:11:41.834 --> 2:11:43.584
- And there's bad news.
- What?

2:11:43.876 --> 2:11:46.376
Bilal's murder case is being
investigated by Hani Mohammad.

2:11:46.667 --> 2:11:48.292
He's already asked for
the last 48 hours details of..

2:11:48.376 --> 2:11:50.917
Check-in and check-out
along with passport details.

2:11:51.126 --> 2:11:52.626
And they're also looking at the CCTV.

2:11:53.042 --> 2:11:55.042
I've already misplaced your details.

2:11:55.376 --> 2:11:56.626
But Hani is brilliant.

2:11:56.667 --> 2:11:59.542
If only ours is missing,
we'll be easy suspects.

2:11:59.751 --> 2:12:02.626
Ask your contact to
misplace a few more contacts.

2:12:02.834 --> 2:12:04.001
We need a little time.

2:12:04.084 --> 2:12:06.709
- Okay, where are you?
- Exchange point.

2:12:06.959 --> 2:12:08.834
- See you at the hospital.
- Okay.

2:12:10.268 --> 2:12:11.268
Yes, Sameer.

2:12:11.292 --> 2:12:13.042
Sir, the Chennai Hospital
website has been hacked.

2:12:13.126 --> 2:12:13.876
We're ready.

2:12:14.042 --> 2:12:15.709
Put a Chennai's
simcard in a cellphone...

2:12:15.876 --> 2:12:17.167
and keep it ready for use.

2:12:17.373 --> 2:12:18.893
The same number should be mentioned...

2:12:18.917 --> 2:12:20.084
in the verification mail as well.

2:12:20.292 --> 2:12:22.542
Tap the Chennai Hospital
landlines. - Okay.

2:12:22.834 --> 2:12:23.917
And if there's any call from Saudi...

2:12:24.001 --> 2:12:25.876
then it should be
diverted to you first.

2:12:26.167 --> 2:12:27.167
Got it, sir.

2:12:27.435 --> 2:12:28.435
You two leave.

2:12:28.459 --> 2:12:30.334
Check-in and handle Chennai and Delhi.

2:12:30.417 --> 2:12:32.042
Ashfaq and I will
handle everything here.

2:12:32.334 --> 2:12:33.501
We'll meet in the flight.

2:12:33.751 --> 2:12:36.209
Jai, you know what to
do if you two are caught?

2:12:36.542 --> 2:12:37.542
Yes, sir.

2:12:38.792 --> 2:12:40.192
You scared the s** out of me again.

2:12:40.209 --> 2:12:41.417
What's your problem?

2:12:42.626 --> 2:12:43.626
Best of luck.

2:13:19.935 --> 2:13:20.935
Excuse me, sir.

2:13:20.959 --> 2:13:22.209
Maulana Sayed Mohammad Rehman.

2:13:22.292 --> 2:13:25.084
LeT Pakistan. Carries a
bounty of 10 million on his head.

2:13:25.542 --> 2:13:26.626
And the deceased?

2:13:26.768 --> 2:13:27.768
Bilal Khan.

2:13:27.792 --> 2:13:30.376
Belongs to a terrorist
group called IM in India.

2:13:32.917 --> 2:13:34.876
Take out all foreigners from the pile.

2:13:35.334 --> 2:13:37.667
I only want to know about the
Indian and Pakistani guests.

2:13:37.751 --> 2:13:38.751
- Okay sir.
- Quick.

2:13:49.393 --> 2:13:50.393
Hello Ajay.

2:13:50.417 --> 2:13:51.667
I'm in the conference,
I'll call you later.

2:13:52.084 --> 2:13:55.542
Be careful.

2:13:56.167 --> 2:13:58.126
Be careful.

2:14:05.042 --> 2:14:06.167
Come.

2:14:35.209 --> 2:14:37.042
One... two... three, go.

2:14:37.126 --> 2:14:38.376
Thank you very much.

2:15:29.126 --> 2:15:30.126
- Greetings.
- Hello.

2:15:30.376 --> 2:15:32.084
Hi, I am looking for a patient.
His name's Aarif Sheikh.

2:15:32.167 --> 2:15:33.167
Excuse me, sir.

2:15:34.209 --> 2:15:36.292
Are you looking for
Aarif Sheikh? - Yes.

2:15:36.709 --> 2:15:38.084
He happens to be my uncle.

2:15:38.209 --> 2:15:40.084
- Please come with me.
- Okay, let's go.

2:16:17.126 --> 2:16:18.292
- Come, this way.
- Okay.

2:17:39.709 --> 2:17:41.167
Zakaat certificate?

2:17:44.667 --> 2:17:46.459
Letter of admission from the hospital.

2:17:49.292 --> 2:17:51.459
- Please call the doctor on duty.
- Yes.

2:18:13.417 --> 2:18:14.417
Sir, it's here.

2:18:14.626 --> 2:18:15.626
Hold, Sameer.

2:18:16.084 --> 2:18:18.376
We're Indians and
we have a reputation.

2:18:18.667 --> 2:18:20.709
If we send a prompt reply,
they'll get suspicious.

2:18:20.959 --> 2:18:21.959
Wait.

2:18:26.917 --> 2:18:28.334
- Hello.
- Greetings.

2:18:28.417 --> 2:18:29.917
Foreign language.

2:18:30.001 --> 2:18:31.042
Foreign language.

2:18:31.126 --> 2:18:32.376
Because he has a lever problem.

2:18:32.459 --> 2:18:34.417
Foreign language.

2:18:35.542 --> 2:18:38.501
Foreign language.

2:18:46.084 --> 2:18:47.417
Foreign language.

2:18:47.501 --> 2:18:49.376
Because he has a lever problem.

2:18:49.459 --> 2:18:53.751
Foreign language.

2:18:54.417 --> 2:18:56.709
Foreign language.

2:18:56.792 --> 2:18:59.584
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2:19:01.001 --> 2:19:03.001
Now, send it.

2:19:15.751 --> 2:19:17.251
Inspector, can I get your signature.

2:19:17.334 --> 2:19:19.417
- Can I use your loo?
- Okay.

2:19:19.501 --> 2:19:20.501
Thank you.

2:20:32.417 --> 2:20:33.417
Show me the form.

2:20:36.376 --> 2:20:38.042
You can show this at the embassy.

2:20:38.376 --> 2:20:39.542
They will issue the visa.

2:20:39.626 --> 2:20:40.084
Okay?

2:20:40.167 --> 2:20:41.126
- Thank you very much.
- Welcome.

2:20:41.209 --> 2:20:42.209
Please.

2:20:45.459 --> 2:20:46.459
Thank you.

2:20:53.584 --> 2:20:54.584
Ajay.

2:20:58.417 --> 2:21:00.376
Oh no. How did his happen?

2:21:06.167 --> 2:21:07.167
Sit here.

2:21:09.542 --> 2:21:10.542
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

2:21:11.501 --> 2:21:12.501
Show it to me.

2:21:12.667 --> 2:21:13.667
Let it be.

2:21:13.959 --> 2:21:15.292
Call your doctor.

2:21:15.709 --> 2:21:18.709
And my bag's in the van downstairs,
get that. - I'll get it.

2:21:33.126 --> 2:21:34.167
Freeze A7.

2:21:37.126 --> 2:21:38.417
Zoom into the car plate.

2:21:40.876 --> 2:21:42.001
Find me this van.

2:22:11.810 --> 2:22:12.810
Hello.

2:22:12.834 --> 2:22:14.234
Sir, we're leaving for the airport.

2:22:14.626 --> 2:22:16.209
You'll have in-flight support.

2:22:25.876 --> 2:22:27.584
I just wrote it down...

2:22:29.792 --> 2:22:30.792
Hold on.

2:22:33.209 --> 2:22:34.209
Yes, Feroz sir.

2:22:34.542 --> 2:22:36.042
I need to see the Minister.

2:22:36.792 --> 2:22:38.584
It's really impossible today.

2:22:38.917 --> 2:22:40.126
Is it very urgent?

2:22:44.667 --> 2:22:45.751
No, Mr. Gupta.

2:22:46.084 --> 2:22:47.667
Nothing urgent, bye.

2:22:57.001 --> 2:22:59.209
- Everything okay?
- All good.

2:23:07.626 --> 2:23:09.334
- Hello.
- Hello.

2:23:09.751 --> 2:23:11.231
I am in a conference, call you later.

2:23:11.459 --> 2:23:12.542
Ajay...

2:23:17.834 --> 2:23:19.042
Are you okay?

2:23:21.001 --> 2:23:22.626
Why? What happened?

2:23:26.792 --> 2:23:28.417
I suddenly felt very scared.

2:23:29.334 --> 2:23:31.292
My heart started racing.

2:23:31.876 --> 2:23:33.376
Are you really okay?

2:23:36.018 --> 2:23:37.018
What will happen to me?

2:23:37.042 --> 2:23:38.334
I am absolutely fine.

2:23:39.084 --> 2:23:40.084
Really?

2:23:41.334 --> 2:23:42.334
Where are the kids?

2:23:44.376 --> 2:23:45.417
At school.

2:23:46.834 --> 2:23:49.584
The conference is about to end,
see you soon.

2:23:49.876 --> 2:23:51.459
See you, bye.

2:23:53.251 --> 2:23:54.501
Just don't die.

2:24:07.834 --> 2:24:10.376
Ajay, the air-paramedics
entrance is on the other side.

2:24:10.584 --> 2:24:11.709
At Gate C.

2:24:12.001 --> 2:24:13.001
Stay there.

2:24:13.167 --> 2:24:14.667
I'll go to the embassy
and complete the formalities.

2:24:14.751 --> 2:24:15.751
We'll meet there.

2:24:16.292 --> 2:24:17.334
Good luck.

2:24:57.667 --> 2:25:00.542
Sir we found the van,
but no one in inside.

2:25:05.185 --> 2:25:06.185
Thank you.

2:25:06.209 --> 2:25:07.209
Thank you.

2:26:00.477 --> 2:26:01.477
See you in the flight.

2:26:01.501 --> 2:26:02.501
Good luck.

2:26:02.542 --> 2:26:04.042
Come on, guys. Let's get it moving.

2:26:04.334 --> 2:26:05.334
C'mon quickly.

2:26:38.042 --> 2:26:39.251
Thank you.

2:26:58.459 --> 2:26:59.876
- Watch where you're going?
- Sorry.

2:27:35.005 --> 2:27:36.685
This is the security
system in the hotel...

2:27:36.709 --> 2:27:39.001
No, I want all security...

2:27:39.084 --> 2:27:41.001
Excuse me, sir, this is the helper.

2:29:08.042 --> 2:29:10.209
Hey you! Stop!

2:29:10.417 --> 2:29:11.542
Stop I say!

2:29:11.751 --> 2:29:13.001
Hands UP!

2:29:15.542 --> 2:29:17.001
Turn around.

2:29:36.126 --> 2:29:37.542
Hey right there.

2:29:41.542 --> 2:29:43.834
- Stop! Don't move.
- Don't move.

2:29:43.917 --> 2:29:45.001
Don't move.

2:29:45.167 --> 2:29:47.376
- Get down on the floor.
- Leave me.

2:29:47.542 --> 2:29:49.584
- Don't move.
- Hey, leave it.

2:29:50.126 --> 2:29:51.126
It's not my bag.

2:29:51.167 --> 2:29:53.084
- What's wrong with you?
- Take his bag.

2:30:06.292 --> 2:30:08.584
Welcome sir. This way.

2:30:08.959 --> 2:30:10.084
Hi.

2:30:10.834 --> 2:30:12.959
Welcome sir.
This way. - Enjoy your flight sir.

2:30:15.917 --> 2:30:17.084
Excuse me, sir.

2:30:32.001 --> 2:30:33.001
Hello.

2:30:33.084 --> 2:30:35.209
Foreign language.

2:30:35.292 --> 2:30:36.417
Foreign language.

2:30:36.501 --> 2:30:39.042
I want some information on passengers,
travelling to India.

2:30:39.251 --> 2:30:42.001
And please asked to ATC
to put all flight on standby.

2:30:42.584 --> 2:30:45.209
Security to ATC, copy.

2:30:45.542 --> 2:30:47.126
ATC to security, copy.

2:30:47.417 --> 2:30:48.751
I repeat, COPY-

2:30:49.001 --> 2:30:50.667
I want to check this passport number.

2:30:50.834 --> 2:30:52.126
One second, sir.

2:30:53.084 --> 2:30:54.626
Can I have the
passengers list, please?

2:30:54.751 --> 2:30:56.001
- Of course.
- Yes sir, Number please?

2:30:56.084 --> 2:31:00.834
G6X505028! Rahul Awasthi.

2:31:01.667 --> 2:31:02.959
This way sir.

2:31:09.185 --> 2:31:10.185
I have him.

2:31:10.209 --> 2:31:11.834
He's boarding Etihad now.

2:31:12.334 --> 2:31:16.417
And Vijay Sharma and Brijmohan Singh?

2:31:16.667 --> 2:31:17.917
One second, sir.

2:31:33.251 --> 2:31:35.167
Yes, they are all travelling together?

2:31:35.251 --> 2:31:36.251
Any problem, sir?

2:31:39.459 --> 2:31:43.126
ATC to security, status update please.

2:31:43.417 --> 2:31:45.876
Is there someone with a
medical condition on the plane?

2:31:46.042 --> 2:31:47.084
Any air-paramedic?

2:31:54.810 --> 2:31:55.810
Yes, sir.

2:31:55.834 --> 2:31:58.459
There's a local resident,
going for a liver ailment.

2:31:58.626 --> 2:31:59.751
Any problem, sir?

2:32:11.334 --> 2:32:12.417
Sir, any problem?

2:32:42.209 --> 2:32:43.334
Sir, any problem?

2:32:48.042 --> 2:32:49.042
No problem!

2:32:50.167 --> 2:32:52.042
ATC to security-Roger that.

2:32:53.376 --> 2:32:54.501
We're good to go guys.

2:33:27.459 --> 2:33:28.917
Sir, the flight has taken off.

2:33:52.501 --> 2:33:54.417
Maulana's capture was not made public.

2:33:55.334 --> 2:33:57.709
First we found out
everything we needed to know.

2:33:58.459 --> 2:33:59.501
6 weeks later

2:33:59.667 --> 2:34:02.376
when he had nothing
more to tell us...

2:34:02.459 --> 2:34:04.251
we took him to Srinagar.

2:34:04.876 --> 2:34:06.959
Out there,
the Army treated him the same way...

2:34:07.667 --> 2:34:09.084
they treat militants.

2:34:17.501 --> 2:34:20.417
Baby... which was just on
a 5 year trial run...

2:34:20.501 --> 2:34:21.751
was shut down.

2:34:22.126 --> 2:34:25.084
And our elite program
was granted permanent status.

2:34:25.459 --> 2:34:28.251
We now have fresh recruits,
and we're more than ready.

2:34:29.126 --> 2:34:31.167
They keep calling us
something or the other.

2:34:31.709 --> 2:34:33.876
But we love the name... Baby!

2:34:58.417 --> 2:35:04.209
"The moments shiver...
time changes its course."

2:35:04.542 --> 2:35:09.167
"The sun sets... on
the horizon faraway."

2:35:09.667 --> 2:35:15.334
"The moments shiver... time
changes its course."

2:35:15.792 --> 2:35:21.417
"The sun sets... on
the horizon faraway."

2:35:21.709 --> 2:35:27.084
"Silence melt away drop by drop."

2:35:27.292 --> 2:35:32.251
"There are no players left... but
the game still goes on."

2:35:32.376 --> 2:35:35.209
"Faces come and go."

2:35:35.292 --> 2:35:38.917
"But the one that
remains in the memories."

2:35:41.167 --> 2:35:43.542
"Carefree..."

2:35:43.709 --> 2:35:46.876
"One that's carefree."

2:35:46.959 --> 2:35:49.001
"Carefree..."

2:35:49.292 --> 2:35:52.417
"One that's carefree."

2:35:52.542 --> 2:35:54.417
"Carefree..."

2:35:55.001 --> 2:35:58.126
"One that's carefree."

2:36:14.667 --> 2:36:17.417
"Don't trust your eyes."

2:36:17.501 --> 2:36:20.209
"Every sight is an illusion."

2:36:20.292 --> 2:36:22.959
"Those who welcome with open arms."

2:36:23.126 --> 2:36:26.167
"Stab you in the back."

2:36:26.542 --> 2:36:29.126
"There's a silence in this racket."

2:36:29.459 --> 2:36:31.959
"Unconsciousness in
this conscious state."

2:36:32.167 --> 2:36:37.251
"Everyone will be tightlipped...
when the silences speak."

2:36:37.334 --> 2:36:40.042
"Faces come and go."

2:36:40.126 --> 2:36:43.126
"But the one that
remains in the memories."

2:36:46.084 --> 2:36:48.167
"Carefree..."

2:36:48.626 --> 2:36:51.792
"One that's carefree."

2:36:51.876 --> 2:36:53.876
"Carefree..."

2:36:54.292 --> 2:36:57.501
"One that's carefree."

2:36:57.584 --> 2:36:59.834
"Carefree..."

2:36:59.917 --> 2:37:03.209
"One that's carefree."

2:37:07.417 --> 2:37:10.334
"Some plain... some very deep."

2:37:10.417 --> 2:37:13.001
"Secrets on my mind."

2:37:13.084 --> 2:37:15.876
"There's a trap within the trap."

2:37:15.959 --> 2:37:18.626
"A face behind every face."

2:37:19.001 --> 2:37:21.709
"All known personalities."

2:37:21.792 --> 2:37:24.584
"All sweet-talking."

2:37:24.667 --> 2:37:29.501
"Don't ever try to
taste... this poison."

2:37:29.542 --> 2:37:32.501
"Faces come and go."

2:37:32.584 --> 2:37:36.542
"But the one that
remains in the memories."

2:37:38.626 --> 2:37:40.709
"Carefree..."

2:37:41.001 --> 2:37:44.167
"One that's carefree."

2:37:44.251 --> 2:37:46.584
"Carefree..."

2:37:46.667 --> 2:37:49.876
"One that's carefree."

2:37:49.959 --> 2:37:52.292
"Carefree..."

2:37:52.376 --> 2:37:55.751
"One that's carefree."
