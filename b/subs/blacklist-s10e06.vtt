10:35.010 --> 10:37.304
He went out the northwest alley.

11:29.064 --> 11:30.774
What are you waiting for? After him!

11:58.427 --> 12:00.178
Fan out. Find him.

12:31.209 --> 12:32.210
He's bleeding.

13:39.069 --> 13:40.862
Careful. They need him alive.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.614
Relax. I'm empty anyway.

13:51.248 --> 13:52.499
Or what?

17:10.739 --> 17:11.740
We're clear.

17:11.740 --> 17:12.866
Good.

17:13.283 --> 17:15.243
What do we know about Mr. Cooper?

17:15.243 --> 17:18.663
From their messages it appears
Cooper runs the task force.

17:18.663 --> 17:22.625
It will take some doing, but
we should be able to get to him in time.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.419
That shouldn't be necessary.

17:24.419 --> 17:26.421
Dembe will tell us
everything we need to know.

17:26.963 --> 17:32.135
Get rid of the phone before you pick up
our friend. I don't want it tracked.

41:04.171 --> 41:06.298
What should be done with Perillos?

41:07.424 --> 41:09.801
She's of no further use to us.

41:10.552 --> 41:12.387
Get rid of her.
