WEBVTT

00:05.089 --> 00:07.633
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart.

00:07.633 --> 00:09.593
Once you rub

00:09.593 --> 00:12.930
a couple of pinches
of powder into the soles,

00:12.930 --> 00:14.098
you'll be flying.

00:14.724 --> 00:16.934
Yes, of course I'm coming.
I promise you.

00:16.934 --> 00:22.064
Just as soon as I smooth over
a minor disagreement here.

00:25.860 --> 00:27.570
This is how you start peace talks?

00:27.570 --> 00:32.074
Given our past, be thankful
you're not strip searched.

00:32.074 --> 00:34.285
We understand.

00:34.285 --> 00:36.912
This puts us at your mercy.

00:36.912 --> 00:39.790
There's nothing about that
that's understandable.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.793
This way.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.174
Why'd you have to insult him?

00:48.174 --> 00:50.009
His family is our enemy.

00:50.009 --> 00:52.553
Whatever happens today
is not gonna change that.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.513
Maybe not for you and Vicente.

00:54.513 --> 00:55.598
Me?

00:55.598 --> 00:58.017
I hope today changes everything.

01:04.190 --> 01:06.567
Ah! Vicente! Raoul!

01:06.567 --> 01:08.611
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

01:08.611 --> 01:11.030
What were you doing in my pantry?

01:11.030 --> 01:12.448
Snooping.

01:12.448 --> 01:15.284
Most people go through the mail
or medicine cabinets.

01:15.284 --> 01:18.954
You'd be surprised
how much a butler's pantry

01:18.954 --> 01:20.623
can tell you about a person.

01:20.623 --> 01:22.500
Well, what did you find out about me?

01:22.500 --> 01:25.544
You have an encyclopedic collection

01:25.544 --> 01:27.213
of crystal and glassware,

01:27.213 --> 01:29.840
everything from highballs
to old-fashioneds,

01:29.840 --> 01:33.219
martinis and pints, brandy snifters.

01:33.219 --> 01:34.553
It's impressive.

01:34.553 --> 01:36.180
I applaud your liver.

01:36.180 --> 01:39.767
But it seems you're nostalgic
for an earlier time.

01:39.767 --> 01:44.647
I didn't expect a meal
so elegantly fin de siecle.

01:44.647 --> 01:47.817
I didn't come here to eat.
I came to listen.

01:47.817 --> 01:50.236
You said you have a proposal.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.738
Let's hear it.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.032
Forbearance.

01:55.032 --> 01:57.493
Forbearance isn't a plan.

01:57.493 --> 01:59.411
No, it's a prerequisite.

01:59.411 --> 02:02.915
It means we eat first
and discuss later.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.253
So, we followed
the column of bubbles,

02:07.253 --> 02:11.423
and there was Vicente,
narked off his gourd

02:11.423 --> 02:15.052
in the sunken chassis
of the '39 Alfa Romeo.

02:15.052 --> 02:17.346
Five more minutes,
and he would have been dead.

02:17.346 --> 02:20.766
But Raoul and I zipped him
to the surface,

02:20.766 --> 02:24.144
where you promptly spat out
your regulator and barked...

02:24.144 --> 02:26.438
"Couldn't you hear me honking
and honking?"

02:28.816 --> 02:31.485
In our minds, that car was mythic.

02:32.611 --> 02:36.073
The ghost in the Bayano Reservoir.

02:36.073 --> 02:38.200
But when we brought it
to the surface...

02:39.535 --> 02:41.620
You know,
all the mystique was gone.

02:41.620 --> 02:46.041
We'd risked our lives
for an old car.

02:46.709 --> 02:48.586
A lot of things in life are like that,

02:48.586 --> 02:51.755
things you think are terribly important,

02:51.755 --> 02:56.427
but when you dredge them up
and really look...

02:57.428 --> 02:58.429
They're not.

03:00.306 --> 03:03.601
My proposal is fair. It will work.

03:03.601 --> 03:06.520
As long as you have forbearance.

03:08.022 --> 03:11.775
So, as a toast, a pledge, to forbearance.

03:12.735 --> 03:15.654
A moment, Raymond. Uh...

03:15.654 --> 03:18.490
I have something very special.

03:19.283 --> 03:21.327
Clos du Mesnil, '06.

03:21.327 --> 03:22.620
Oh, my goodness.

03:22.620 --> 03:23.787
For everyone.

03:23.787 --> 03:26.415
Sparkling cider for me.

03:26.415 --> 03:30.085
Sulfite allergies, I'm afraid.

03:30.085 --> 03:31.170
Yeah.

03:31.170 --> 03:34.632
And no, Raoul,
I'm not trying to poison you.

03:34.632 --> 03:38.010
I just don't want to poison myself.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.138
To forbearance.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.016
To forbearance.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.768
- Salud.
- Salud.

03:45.768 --> 03:48.145
Salud.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.276
Well, that is delicious, Vicente.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.034
You okay?

04:04.078 --> 04:06.080
- Vicente!
- He may be in shock.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.374
Lie him down.
Does anyone have an EpiPen?

04:08.374 --> 04:09.750
Yes, I have one.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.384
Vicente?

04:18.384 --> 04:19.551
What have you done?

04:19.551 --> 04:21.095
Me? The food is yours!

04:21.095 --> 04:22.805
He drank his own cider!

04:24.390 --> 04:26.016
Leon didn't.

04:28.852 --> 04:29.895
I'll call 911.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.105
No, you won't.

04:31.105 --> 04:33.482
They're anaphylactic.
They might die if I don't.

04:33.482 --> 04:36.068
The rest of us will die if you do.

04:37.778 --> 04:41.532
I'm afraid
I've seen this before.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.158
I know what comes next.

04:43.158 --> 04:44.994
Nobody leaves.

04:44.994 --> 04:46.578
Nobody comes in.

04:46.578 --> 04:50.499
I'll explain why
after we do everything we can

04:50.499 --> 04:53.877
to make Vicente and Leon
a little more comfortable.

04:53.877 --> 04:56.922
Forbearance is suddenly
the least of our problems.

05:06.557 --> 05:09.393
This is my two-month token,
and I want you to have it.

05:09.393 --> 05:11.145
It's your chip. You earned it.

05:11.145 --> 05:13.731
I saw my dealer yesterday.
Not like that.

05:13.731 --> 05:17.067
He was in my CVS,
buying Preparation H.

05:17.067 --> 05:20.320
At first I was like, "Wow. Karma, right?"

05:20.320 --> 05:22.948
Then... I waited on the urge.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.992
To buy. To use.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.160
But it was just weird.

05:26.160 --> 05:30.873
It was like when you were a kid,
seeing your teacher outside of school.

05:30.873 --> 05:32.374
That's a huge step.

05:32.374 --> 05:35.294
Oh, and I moved back in with Jill.

05:35.294 --> 05:37.212
Whoa. That's incredible.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.673
Yeah. She knows that
I'm a-a work in progress.

05:39.673 --> 05:43.135
But she said that she likes
what she's seen so far.

05:43.135 --> 05:46.555
And a lot of that is because of you.

05:46.555 --> 05:48.474
No. It's you.

05:48.474 --> 05:52.061
Next to Jill, you are the most
important person in my life.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.355
And-- And I barely know
anything about you.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.108
Well, the "A" in "NA"
stands for "anonymous."

05:58.108 --> 06:00.527
I know what I need to know.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.820
You saved my life.

06:04.364 --> 06:07.576
Which is why
this belongs to you.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.626
<i>Vicente</i> and <i>Leon?</i>

06:15.626 --> 06:17.544
Yes, within seconds of each other.

06:17.544 --> 06:20.464
After the toast? So it was the wine.

06:20.464 --> 06:22.382
They drank from separate bottles.

06:22.382 --> 06:26.220
Whatever the toxin,
my guess is we've all been exposed.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.972
It reminds me of the incident
in East Timor.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.641
You said you thought he was dead.

06:30.641 --> 06:33.102
I did. I'm afraid I may have been wrong.

06:35.854 --> 06:37.773
We know him
only as Wormwood.

06:37.773 --> 06:40.275
A hired killer.
Relatively new in the game.

06:40.275 --> 06:42.277
But his poisons are nearly undetectable.

06:42.277 --> 06:44.780
This Wormwood just poisoned two people?

06:44.780 --> 06:45.948
Two brothers.

06:47.199 --> 06:48.575
Vicente and Leon Sandoval.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.285
Killed at their villa in Miami.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.287
The Sandoval and Montano family

06:52.287 --> 06:54.957
own a mine in the Dominican Republic.

06:54.957 --> 06:57.626
Rich in cobalt and aluminum.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.545
Decades ago, negligence by a member

06:59.545 --> 07:02.214
of the Sandoval family
resulted in a mining accident

07:02.214 --> 07:05.050
that claimed the life
of the Montanos' patriarch.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.552
Within a few weeks,

07:06.552 --> 07:08.762
two Sandovals had been killed
in retaliation,

07:08.762 --> 07:11.306
and the families have been
blood enemies ever since.

07:11.306 --> 07:12.891
What's this got to do with Red?

07:12.891 --> 07:14.935
Once the feud started,
the mining stopped.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.270
Sensing an opportunity,

07:16.270 --> 07:18.313
Raymond offered to manage
the mine for them.

07:18.313 --> 07:19.940
He solved their business problem,

07:19.940 --> 07:21.692
but clearly not their personal one.

07:21.692 --> 07:25.112
That's what he wanted to do today.
It seems someone disagreed.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.822
Which brings us back to Wormwood.

07:26.822 --> 07:27.906
Who is he?

07:27.906 --> 07:30.909
I don't care who he is.
I care who hired him.

07:30.909 --> 07:31.994
It wasn't me.

07:31.994 --> 07:34.246
Then why is it only my family
was poisoned?

07:34.246 --> 07:36.456
Wormwood doesn't poison people

07:36.456 --> 07:40.711
so much as he hot-wires
their immune systems

07:40.711 --> 07:43.964
to make them even more
vulnerable to <i>be</i> poisoned.

07:43.964 --> 07:47.259
He weaponizes
even the smallest allergen,

07:47.259 --> 07:49.553
and he hides his target

07:49.553 --> 07:54.433
by making everyone around
that target equally at risk.

07:54.433 --> 07:57.519
If I'm right
and this is Wormwood,

07:57.519 --> 07:58.937
we've all been exposed.

07:58.937 --> 08:02.107
A jet crash in
the rice fields of East Timor

08:02.232 --> 08:04.234
after a bad in-flight meal.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.361
And last year, the former CEO

08:06.361 --> 08:08.363
of GoldiBlock Security and Software

08:08.363 --> 08:10.490
was found dead
on a Madagascar beach,

08:10.490 --> 08:12.576
killed by his suntan lotion.

08:12.576 --> 08:14.953
Each death caused
by a previously mild,

08:14.953 --> 08:16.955
suddenly virulent allergy in the victim.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.582
I need some air.

08:18.582 --> 08:19.708
Open that window

08:19.708 --> 08:21.919
and it might be
the last breath you take.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.546
Next time, they should wand you.

08:24.546 --> 08:25.923
We did wand him.

08:25.923 --> 08:30.010
- I don't have any allergies!
- Or an attention span, apparently.

08:30.010 --> 08:33.222
We now are vulnerable to everything.

08:33.222 --> 08:35.515
And we can't do anything about that

08:35.515 --> 08:38.101
until we know
how we've been made vulnerable.

08:38.101 --> 08:41.188
And until we figure that out,
we aren't going anywhere.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.065
But rest assured,

08:43.065 --> 08:46.401
I have the top man
working on it as we speak.

08:46.401 --> 08:47.945
Yeah. Forget it.

08:47.945 --> 08:50.197
You won't be eating the food
or drinking the wine.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.074
Going there
won't put you in any risk.

08:52.074 --> 08:54.076
Going into a room
with mortal enemies,

08:54.076 --> 08:55.160
two dead bodies,

08:55.160 --> 08:56.954
and three decades
of recrimination? I'm good.

08:56.954 --> 08:59.206
It's not just the families
that are at risk.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.415
Raymond is, too.

09:00.415 --> 09:03.460
These are seasoned criminals.
I can't just roll up in there.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.129
You can, as Red's medical expert.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.382
But I'm not Red's medical expert.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.676
Herbert is my medical expert,

09:10.676 --> 09:13.053
a world-renowned forensics analyst.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.430
The suit is not only
for his protection,

09:15.430 --> 09:19.059
but also to protect us from...
well, everything.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.394
Sorry for your loss.

09:20.394 --> 09:21.979
He didn't lose anyone.

09:21.979 --> 09:23.438
Or kill anyone.

09:23.438 --> 09:24.940
Well, you keep saying that.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.441
Because it's true.

09:26.441 --> 09:29.194
I came here to make peace,
especially now.

09:29.194 --> 09:30.279
Especially now?

09:30.279 --> 09:32.572
The feud began with the murder
of a Montano.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.367
Let it end with the death
of two Sandovals!

09:37.202 --> 09:38.203
Enough!

09:42.499 --> 09:43.667
Raoul?

09:45.294 --> 09:46.295
Raoul?

09:46.295 --> 09:48.380
- Raoul?
- No, no, no, no.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.177
Please! Do something!

09:54.177 --> 09:56.513
There's nothing he can do.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.807
That's dermatographia.

09:58.807 --> 10:02.728
It's an allergy to human touch.
It's quite common. It's never deadly.

10:02.728 --> 10:04.730
Until now.

10:04.730 --> 10:07.065
You saw it.

10:07.065 --> 10:08.775
He murdered my father.

10:08.775 --> 10:12.070
We saw
your father murdered, but not by Izan.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.698
There's a pox on both your houses.

10:14.698 --> 10:17.826
If I were you,
I'd start working on that peace,

10:17.826 --> 10:21.079
because you have more
in common now than ever.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.622
Someone wants you all dead.

10:28.837 --> 10:31.214
Are you seeing my spectroscopy report?

10:31.214 --> 10:33.759
Seeing, yes. Understanding, no.

10:33.759 --> 10:36.011
The food's been laced
with a chemical compound

10:36.011 --> 10:37.721
that excites immunoglobulin E.

10:37.721 --> 10:41.725
Immunoglobulin E is the antibody
responsible for most allergic reactions.

10:41.725 --> 10:45.270
By exciting it, Wormwood has turned
mild reactions into deadly ones.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.064
It looks like Leon
had a mild version

10:47.064 --> 10:48.648
of his brother's sulfite allergy.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.276
But as for Vicente,
trace amounts of sulfites

10:51.276 --> 10:53.070
are a natural by-product
of cider making.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.821
I mean, not enough
to put on the label,

10:54.821 --> 10:56.448
but in this case, enough to kill.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.700
Is the compound traceable
to Wormwood?

10:58.700 --> 10:59.826
Theoretically, yes.

10:59.826 --> 11:03.663
It's built onto a base molecule
used in blood pressure medications.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.749
Send us a list
of the medications.

11:05.749 --> 11:07.626
We'll find the pharmaceutical
company that makes them

11:07.626 --> 11:09.044
and track him through their records.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.546
Two warring families.
Poison. Murder.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.215
This case is straight
out of my book club.

11:13.215 --> 11:16.259
You're in a book club that's
reading <i>Romeo and Juliet?</i>

11:16.259 --> 11:17.677
What? No. <i>Dune.</i>

11:17.677 --> 11:19.471
The Capulets have nothing
on the Harkonnens.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.014
You do know that George Lucas

11:21.014 --> 11:22.682
stole the whole Jedi thing
from Frank Herbert, right?

11:22.682 --> 11:23.850
Feel free
to fill us in

11:23.850 --> 11:25.936
after you send over
that list of chemicals.

11:27.938 --> 11:31.066
The Harkonnens may be
more devious than the Capulets,

11:31.066 --> 11:33.485
but they have nothing
on the Montanos.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.153
I'm Gabriella Sandoval,
Vicente's daughter.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.696
Did the peace talks
drag on all night?

11:36.696 --> 11:37.948
Just--
Just for your own safety,

11:37.948 --> 11:39.282
for your own safety,
please step back.

11:39.282 --> 11:41.368
Just step back, please. Step back.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.621
What's going on?
Why are you here and wearing that?

11:44.621 --> 11:46.206
Oh.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.749
I'm here

11:47.749 --> 11:51.253
wearing that
because something terrible...

11:52.129 --> 11:53.588
I'm so sorry.

11:53.588 --> 11:55.298
Your father is dead.

11:57.134 --> 11:58.260
What?

11:59.636 --> 12:00.887
No, that's not true.

12:06.309 --> 12:07.352
What are you doing?

12:07.352 --> 12:10.397
Taking over the family
and the war.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.065
Geez. It's getting hard
to breathe in here.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.942
Your war killed my father.

12:13.942 --> 12:16.153
Your brother is dead
because of the war.

12:16.153 --> 12:18.363
Which is why it's a war we have to win.

12:18.363 --> 12:21.616
When it's your turn to wear this,
I hope you accept that.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.410
Reddington's right.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.704
We have a common enemy.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.467
- Are we still at risk?
- I don't know.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.594
But I gave our friends
a lead on Wormwood,

12:40.594 --> 12:42.721
so once they find him,
we'll figure it out.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.348
You know, over the years,

12:45.348 --> 12:47.893
women have gazed upon me

12:47.893 --> 12:51.188
with pretty equal measures
of love and loathing.

12:51.188 --> 12:52.981
My survival has often depended

12:52.981 --> 12:57.068
on being able to tell the difference.

13:01.490 --> 13:05.494
David, what the hell?
The window!

13:05.494 --> 13:06.828
He opened it.

13:06.828 --> 13:08.830
You told him not to, but he did.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.710
He's gonna get us all killed!

13:19.299 --> 13:21.760
I was given a list

13:21.760 --> 13:24.346
who would be here.

13:24.346 --> 13:25.555
You weren't on it.

13:25.555 --> 13:28.141
Tito Sandoval canceled last minute.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.560
A seat was open.
My father invited me.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.563
I was surprised.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.941
Apparently, I wasn't the only one.

13:37.692 --> 13:39.277
I don't know what you mean.

13:39.277 --> 13:42.364
Oh, I think you do, Don Montano.

13:53.458 --> 13:56.461
The base compound
Herbie gave us is in public domain.

13:56.461 --> 13:59.923
A dozen companies make the meds,
and the distribution's global.

13:59.923 --> 14:02.509
There's no way to ID Wormwood
from that supply chain.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.219
So the drugs are a dead end.

14:04.219 --> 14:06.012
Yes, but there was a chef.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.389
And if she poisoned
the food for Wormwood--

14:07.389 --> 14:08.765
Do you have a name?

14:08.765 --> 14:12.435
Naomi Lindquist, of Naomi Osteria.

14:12.435 --> 14:14.688
Raymond loves her gnocchi.

14:14.688 --> 14:17.274
What I know
about wormwood is this.

14:17.274 --> 14:19.776
It's a shrub. It has a bitter taste.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.152
It's used in vermouth.

14:21.152 --> 14:24.489
This Wormwood is a person,
not a shrub, and they kill people

14:24.489 --> 14:27.033
using their natural
allergic response system.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.702
Tell us about the job.

14:28.702 --> 14:32.998
It was a job like any other job, except...

14:35.041 --> 14:36.042
Pistachio.

14:37.127 --> 14:38.336
More acid.

14:38.336 --> 14:39.421
Except what?

14:40.338 --> 14:42.507
Except for the tension.

14:42.507 --> 14:45.260
If you insist
on going through with this,

14:45.260 --> 14:47.053
you'll choke on your peace.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.888
Did you just threaten me?

14:48.888 --> 14:51.308
I'll do more than that if you
don't stop with this nonsense.

14:53.143 --> 14:54.728
What are you looking at?

14:54.728 --> 14:59.232
That was Vicente Sandoval
and some relative.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.317
Tito?

15:00.317 --> 15:01.901
Perhaps you should
be talking to them.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.945
Four people are dead
because they ate your food.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.990
Four people <i>are</i> dead,
but not because of what they ate.

15:06.990 --> 15:08.700
Well, how can you be so sure?

15:08.700 --> 15:10.327
Because I ate.

15:10.327 --> 15:13.622
There isn't a dish
that goes out I don't taste.

15:13.622 --> 15:14.956
It's yummy.

15:14.956 --> 15:17.459
You said this Wormwood
attacks his victim

15:17.459 --> 15:19.127
via their allergies?

15:19.127 --> 15:20.795
I have a nut allergy.

15:20.795 --> 15:25.050
It gives me another sense with
which to understand my medium.

15:25.050 --> 15:28.970
If I were poisoned,
would I still be alive?

15:28.970 --> 15:31.640
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a restaurant to run.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.560
Before you ask, the answer is no.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.187
Legislative affairs
is happy to cooperate--

15:37.187 --> 15:39.606
Jonathan, I called you in today
to talk to you,

15:39.606 --> 15:40.857
not a press liaison.

15:40.857 --> 15:43.526
T-This isn't about OLA?

15:43.526 --> 15:45.945
No. It's about
your relationship with Donald Ressler.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.114
I understand you're helping
each other recover.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.283
I respect that,

15:50.283 --> 15:52.577
but not as much
as I respect our country.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.871
F-First of all, my relationship
with Don Ressler

15:54.871 --> 15:56.581
is none of your business.

15:56.581 --> 16:00.585
And second, he's a patriot
who has devoted his life to the FBI.

16:00.585 --> 16:04.089
Agent Ressler is an integral
part of a secret task force

16:04.089 --> 16:06.716
working on behalf
of Raymond Reddington.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.802
The crime lord? That's laughable.

16:08.802 --> 16:11.471
And has nothing to do with me.
Why am I here?

16:11.471 --> 16:13.306
- I need proof.
- No.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.433
I need someone close to
a task force member to get it for me.

16:15.433 --> 16:16.976
Then find someone else.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.603
- There is no one else.
- He's my friend.

16:18.603 --> 16:20.939
You're the only one
in a position to find out,

16:20.939 --> 16:22.524
to help him.

16:22.524 --> 16:25.527
I don't believe you.

16:25.527 --> 16:28.530
Elizabeth Keen
was a corrupt FBI agent

16:28.530 --> 16:30.615
and Reddington's heir apparent.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.158
She was also Ressler's lover.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.828
You don't believe me?
Ask him about her.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.996
Ask him about Liz Keen.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.506
We're running out of time.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.841
For them and for Reddington.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.551
We need to find Tito Sandoval.

16:49.551 --> 16:52.554
The chef heard him threaten
Vicente over peace talks.

16:52.554 --> 16:54.139
And the food. Did he poison it?

16:54.139 --> 16:56.057
It wasn't the food.
The chef tasted everything.

16:56.057 --> 16:57.976
She's got allergies.
She's not sick.

16:57.976 --> 16:59.227
We spoke to Raymond.

16:59.227 --> 17:00.729
Tito was a no-show at the meeting.

17:00.729 --> 17:02.814
He said he'd rather kill people
than make peace,

17:02.814 --> 17:05.900
and the people who tried
making peace have been killed.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.861
At a meeting he was
supposed to attend but didn't.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.446
Does Reddington know where Tito is?

17:09.446 --> 17:11.406
No, but he's trying to find out.

17:11.406 --> 17:13.366
Soon as he does, you pick him up.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.201
Everything okay?

17:15.201 --> 17:17.287
It's my sponsee, but I'll--
I'll see him after--

17:17.287 --> 17:18.913
Go. Check on your guy.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.749
Dembe and Siya can track down Tito.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.002
This was my goal.

17:24.002 --> 17:25.754
<i>You</i> were my goal.

17:25.754 --> 17:28.298
A new generation taking charge,

17:28.298 --> 17:32.010
leaving old wounds and grudges behind.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.887
You did this. You killed them.

17:33.887 --> 17:36.347
This was my goal, not my plan.

17:36.347 --> 17:39.601
I intended to talk you all
to death, not kill you.

17:39.601 --> 17:42.353
I've lost eight family members
to this war.

17:42.353 --> 17:46.107
I told my father this was senseless
and urged him to make peace.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.610
I never expected to wear this.

17:48.610 --> 17:51.738
But now that I do, I promise you, Izan,

17:51.738 --> 17:54.574
as far as my family is concerned,

17:55.992 --> 17:57.452
the dying stops here.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.874
If you need
an incentive, try this.

18:02.874 --> 18:04.834
What's happened here,

18:04.834 --> 18:07.003
your brother Tito is responsible for it.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.421
No. That can't be.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.298
There's only
one way to find out.

18:10.298 --> 18:12.133
He would never move
against family.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.427
He was against the peace.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.554
He should have been here but wasn't.

18:16.554 --> 18:20.683
If this is to end,
he needs to answer for himself.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.227
Where is he?

18:23.186 --> 18:24.354
- I don't know.
- I do.

18:25.814 --> 18:27.357
We were tracking you.

18:27.357 --> 18:29.567
The meeting was on your property.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.194
We needed to be sure
there were no surprises.

18:31.194 --> 18:32.570
Surprises?

18:32.570 --> 18:34.781
This peace was founded
on a good-faith negotiation.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.449
The fact that you'd go
behind our backs--

18:36.449 --> 18:38.535
It was my father's decision.

18:39.494 --> 18:41.830
But honestly... he was right.

18:42.997 --> 18:47.252
Most good-faith negotiations
don't end in murder.

18:47.252 --> 18:49.170
If Tito is responsible,

18:49.170 --> 18:51.840
there can be no peace
until he's found.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.633
So where is he?

18:58.012 --> 18:59.305
Room's clean.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.933
FBI, Mr. Sandoval.
Open the door.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.436
Mr. Sandoval?

19:05.436 --> 19:07.105
Gun!

19:19.784 --> 19:21.661
Hey! What the hell's
going on here?

19:24.372 --> 19:26.040
And my father, too?

19:26.040 --> 19:27.792
You look surprised.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.460
You burst in here

19:29.460 --> 19:31.796
and tell me my father and uncle
have been murdered.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.047
Of course I'm surprised.

19:33.047 --> 19:34.924
Who is Wormwood?

19:34.924 --> 19:36.009
I have no idea.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.844
Was the plan only to kill Montanos?

19:37.844 --> 19:40.722
Is that why you're surprised?
The collateral damage?

19:40.722 --> 19:43.808
You think I did this?
You think I killed my family?

19:43.808 --> 19:46.311
The chef heard you
in the kitchen,

19:46.311 --> 19:49.480
threatening to kill your uncle
if he tried to make peace.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.357
Yeah, I threatened him.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.568
But that's all it was, a threat.

19:53.568 --> 19:55.528
Everyone there has been poisoned,

19:55.528 --> 19:57.405
and you're here what,
raiding the mini-bar?

19:57.405 --> 20:01.409
I'm here because my uncle
wouldn't let me be there.

20:01.409 --> 20:03.703
What are you looking at?

20:05.538 --> 20:07.040
Listen to me.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.791
You will be betrayed

20:08.791 --> 20:11.210
the second you lower your guard.

20:11.210 --> 20:15.048
The only language the Montanos
understand is violence!

20:17.300 --> 20:19.052
Reddington is mediating.

20:19.052 --> 20:22.347
They know better than to try
anything when he's involved.

20:22.347 --> 20:26.809
Now, all you have to do is sit, nod,

20:26.809 --> 20:29.729
and stop acting like a child.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.189
I can't support this.

20:31.189 --> 20:33.316
Support?

20:33.316 --> 20:35.485
I expect obedience.

20:35.485 --> 20:39.489
If you can't give me that,
I don't want you there.

20:39.489 --> 20:40.865
<i>I warned him.</i>

20:40.865 --> 20:43.618
He'd still be a alive
if he'd listened to me.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.204
Everyone in that room may die.

20:46.204 --> 20:48.539
Izan is there. Your flesh and blood.

20:48.539 --> 20:51.167
- If you can help us--
- I would if I could.

20:51.167 --> 20:52.627
Wormwood can. Just tell us--

20:52.627 --> 20:55.046
I already told you!
I don't know who that is!

20:55.046 --> 20:58.216
Except that apparently
he killed my family.

20:58.216 --> 20:59.842
Why would you think I'd want that?

20:59.842 --> 21:01.511
Because everyone else is dead.

21:01.511 --> 21:03.680
Or may die except for you,

21:03.680 --> 21:06.265
which would end the war
and make you king.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.350
Of what?

21:08.351 --> 21:09.769
An empire of the dead?

21:10.520 --> 21:11.729
You're under arrest.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.149
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say

21:15.149 --> 21:17.402
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

21:19.737 --> 21:20.905
Dembe.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.448
No. No, no, no no,
no, no, no, no.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.741
Call 911.

21:23.741 --> 21:26.452
It's Wormwood.

21:26.452 --> 21:27.787
He's been poisoned, too.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.872
There must have been something
on my hands when I touched him.

21:29.872 --> 21:30.957
Hold on.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.083
We're getting you help now.

21:32.083 --> 21:34.377
- Hello?
- <i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

21:34.377 --> 21:37.422
I need an ambulance
at Hotel Marmae, room 205.

21:53.646 --> 21:54.981
- Donald.
- <i>Hey, Jon.</i>

21:54.981 --> 21:56.065
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

21:56.065 --> 21:57.775
You texted me but then went AWOL.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.277
I was about to call your wife.

21:59.277 --> 22:02.155
- I'm-- I'm glad you didn't.
<i>- Are you using?</i>

22:02.155 --> 22:05.241
I-I've been-- I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

22:05.241 --> 22:07.243
Look. Where are you?
I'm coming to get you.

22:07.243 --> 22:08.536
<i>I'll be okay. Thank you.</i>

22:08.536 --> 22:11.039
It's just work's been beating me up.

22:11.039 --> 22:14.042
I-I've been-- I've been asked to--

22:14.042 --> 22:16.878
To pry into someone's personal life,

22:16.878 --> 22:18.463
someone I care about.

22:18.463 --> 22:20.465
Why would they ask you to do that?

22:20.465 --> 22:22.383
<i>They say that it's for his own good,</i>

22:22.383 --> 22:26.220
this friend of me is, uh,
is being taken advantage of,

22:26.220 --> 22:28.306
<i>and if I got, um, proof of that,</i>

22:28.306 --> 22:30.433
they might be able to,
you know, set him straight.

22:30.433 --> 22:32.268
<i>I'm sorry you're
getting pressured like that,</i>

22:32.268 --> 22:34.520
but you can't let this
push you off the wagon.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.522
You worked way too hard to relapse now.

22:36.522 --> 22:37.940
<i>One time at a meeting,</i>

22:37.940 --> 22:40.610
I remember you talking about...
falling back,

22:40.610 --> 22:41.819
you know, using again.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.197
<i>It was something personal,
right, the trigger?</i>

22:44.197 --> 22:45.698
- Yeah.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

22:45.698 --> 22:48.534
I don't want to take you back.
I-It's just--

22:48.534 --> 22:50.912
It-- It helps to know
I'm not alone, you know?

22:50.912 --> 22:52.663
Well, I lost someone.

22:52.663 --> 22:54.624
Someone I cared about very much.

22:54.624 --> 22:56.042
<i>Did they die?</i>

22:56.042 --> 22:58.461
Yeah. She was killed
right in front of me.

22:58.461 --> 22:59.962
Oh, God.

22:59.962 --> 23:02.090
Oh. I'm-- I'm so sorry.

23:02.090 --> 23:03.716
That-- That must have been horrifying.

23:04.967 --> 23:06.677
Well, I spun out hard after that.

23:06.677 --> 23:09.680
I smoked, snorted,
whatever I could do to forget.

23:09.680 --> 23:13.267
But of course you can't forget.
At least I can't.

23:13.267 --> 23:16.312
<i>So I go to the meetings. I talk it out.</i>

23:16.312 --> 23:19.273
Thank you for... for sharing that,

23:19.273 --> 23:21.067
<i>for letting me hang on to you.</i>

23:21.067 --> 23:23.236
Hey, we're hanging on
to each other.

23:25.029 --> 23:27.281
W-What was her name?

23:28.533 --> 23:31.119
Liz. Her name was Liz.

23:33.538 --> 23:35.998
Tell me exactly how it happened.

23:35.998 --> 23:37.875
<i>Tito reacted to my touch.</i>

23:37.875 --> 23:39.794
There must have been something
on my hands,

23:39.794 --> 23:41.420
moisturizer or soap.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.923
We won't know for sure until
the tox report is complete.

23:43.923 --> 23:45.424
<i>Five people are dead</i>

23:45.424 --> 23:47.969
and we're no closer
to identifying Wormwood

23:47.969 --> 23:49.554
<i>or how he put you at risk.</i>

23:49.554 --> 23:52.306
What was our common point
of exposure?

23:52.306 --> 23:53.516
<i>Not the wine.</i>

23:53.516 --> 23:54.892
The food, then?

23:54.892 --> 23:57.436
<i>Well, the chef ate it, and she's fine.</i>

23:57.436 --> 23:59.939
Tito didn't. He's dead.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.108
<i>What else? Think.</i>

24:03.234 --> 24:04.652
The dishes.

24:04.652 --> 24:06.654
Tito wasn't at the meal.

24:06.654 --> 24:08.281
But he <i>was</i> in the kitchen,

24:08.281 --> 24:10.992
and that's when he cut his hand
when he smashed the dish.

24:10.992 --> 24:12.660
<i>They're a common denominator.</i>

24:12.660 --> 24:14.412
<i>The waiters touched them, too,</i>

24:14.412 --> 24:16.956
and as far as we know,
they haven't been exposed.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.125
No, because they wore gloves.

24:19.125 --> 24:22.545
I thought it was a nod
to elegance and charm.

24:22.545 --> 24:25.381
I assumed it was Vicente's doing.

24:25.381 --> 24:27.592
<i>That theory expired with him.</i>

24:27.592 --> 24:29.010
Do you have another theory?

24:29.010 --> 24:30.178
<i>Maybe.</i>

24:30.178 --> 24:34.140
But I need Herbie to speak
with a waiter to confirm it.

24:38.144 --> 24:40.104
Why are you wearing that?

24:40.104 --> 24:43.024
Oh, this. Um, I can explain.

24:43.024 --> 24:44.692
Oh, God. Are we dying, too?

24:44.692 --> 24:45.902
No, no, no. No. No.

24:45.902 --> 24:47.528
But if you are, which I doubt,

24:47.528 --> 24:49.530
I don't want to be the one to kill you.

24:49.530 --> 24:51.324
Let me start over. The dishes--

24:51.324 --> 24:53.492
Did you ever touch them?

24:53.492 --> 24:55.453
You're really freaking me out.

24:55.453 --> 24:56.579
If it's any consolation,

24:56.579 --> 24:58.039
it's like 1,000 degrees in here.

24:58.039 --> 25:00.541
I wasn't poisoned,
but I may die of heat stroke.

25:00.541 --> 25:01.876
So I was poisoned?

25:01.876 --> 25:04.295
Not if you didn't touch the dishes
with your bare hands.

25:04.295 --> 25:05.796
We were told not to,

25:05.796 --> 25:07.340
ordered to wear gloves
the whole time.

25:07.340 --> 25:10.134
Oh. Okay. This order--
Who gave it to you?

25:15.139 --> 25:16.182
Gabriella.

25:21.938 --> 25:23.147
Mr. Reddington.

25:25.233 --> 25:26.817
I'm so sorry.

25:27.902 --> 25:30.196
Your upset is apparent and moving.

25:30.196 --> 25:35.034
Clearly you find what is happening in here
deeply disturbing.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.702
I do.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.788
You can't imagine how much.

25:38.788 --> 25:41.916
Oh, I'm fairly confident I can.

25:41.916 --> 25:43.584
Of course.

25:43.584 --> 25:46.254
The loss of a parent is universal.

25:47.255 --> 25:50.007
As is the fear of losing a lover.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.803
The gloves were a necessary precaution.

25:53.803 --> 25:56.514
Didn't want to start killing off the help.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.975
I don't know
what you're talking about.

26:00.101 --> 26:03.688
I'm late
for a very important engagement,

26:03.688 --> 26:06.190
so I'll cut right to it.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.192
I'm not afraid to die.

26:08.192 --> 26:10.945
As that is the exception to the rule,

26:10.945 --> 26:13.572
I almost always have the advantage.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.449
I certainly do with you.

26:15.449 --> 26:17.868
I'm afraid I don't understand.

26:17.868 --> 26:19.537
I'm not afraid to die.

26:19.537 --> 26:24.542
You, on the other hand,
are terrified that Michael will.

26:25.876 --> 26:28.087
What the waiters wore,
what you ate.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.922
Dad asked me
to organize the dinner,

26:29.922 --> 26:31.007
so that's what I did.

26:31.007 --> 26:37.054
What you did was try and kill
everyone between you

26:37.054 --> 26:39.015
and happily ever after.

26:39.974 --> 26:43.311
The warriors and extremists
on both sides

26:43.311 --> 26:46.689
who'd never approve
of Romeo and Juliet.

26:46.689 --> 26:51.694
Unfortunately, Tito canceled
and... Romeo snuck in.

26:51.694 --> 26:54.363
Yes, I want peace,

26:54.363 --> 26:56.157
for lots of reasons.

26:56.157 --> 26:58.200
That's what today was about.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.453
Why would I do anything to ruin that?

27:00.453 --> 27:05.666
Because generations of war
made you doubt I could mediate peace

27:05.666 --> 27:10.838
and because you thought maybe
the world would assume that I,

27:10.838 --> 27:14.884
being who I am,
might have been the target of this attack,

27:14.884 --> 27:17.345
perhaps the others collateral damage,

27:17.345 --> 27:21.807
but certainly, no one would
so much as look in your direction.

27:23.476 --> 27:24.477
Yes?

27:24.477 --> 27:26.645
No? Nothing?

27:27.563 --> 27:28.564
Oh, well.

27:28.564 --> 27:30.191
What are you doing?

27:31.359 --> 27:33.986
As I said,
I'm late for an engagement,

27:33.986 --> 27:36.364
and death is a friend.

27:37.198 --> 27:40.034
Please. Don't do that.

27:40.034 --> 27:41.452
Tell me why not.

27:41.452 --> 27:43.996
And if you're honest, maybe I won't.

27:49.126 --> 27:51.379
Because if you do it,

27:51.379 --> 27:52.963
it might kill the man I love.

27:55.758 --> 27:58.928
Wormwood.
Where can we find him?

28:00.012 --> 28:02.473
All I have is an IP address
on the dark web.

28:02.473 --> 28:04.809
Since I saw Michael,
I've been trying to contact him,

28:04.809 --> 28:06.227
but he hasn't responded.

28:06.227 --> 28:08.396
Does Michael know what you've done?

28:08.396 --> 28:11.065
No. But I did it for him.

28:11.065 --> 28:12.483
For us.

28:12.483 --> 28:14.527
Ah. And the toxin?

28:14.527 --> 28:16.904
All I have is the empty bottle
it came in.

28:16.904 --> 28:18.572
Well, that's a start.

28:18.572 --> 28:20.241
Get me a photo of it.

28:20.991 --> 28:22.576
Please.

28:22.576 --> 28:24.161
I <i>am</i> sorry.

28:24.954 --> 28:26.330
Some killers are.

28:31.127 --> 28:33.712
<i>This is what Gabriella
got from Wormwood.</i>

28:33.712 --> 28:35.297
<i>It's called a reagent bottle.</i>

28:35.297 --> 28:37.967
They're used exclusively
for research and development.

28:37.967 --> 28:39.635
This one's made by Polmyrex.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.220
Does it get us closer to Wormwood?

28:41.220 --> 28:42.388
<i>Not by itself.</i>

28:42.388 --> 28:45.808
<i>Polmyrex distributes it
to 15 pharmaceutical companies.</i>

28:45.808 --> 28:47.518
I cross-referenced
our list of buyers

28:47.518 --> 28:49.937
with the list of potential
pharmaceutical manufacturers

28:49.937 --> 28:52.231
we got from Herbie,
and we got one hit.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.400
A company called Heliod RX.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.609
<i>We're headed there now.</i>

28:55.609 --> 28:58.279
Good luck. And keep us posted.

28:58.279 --> 29:01.323
That's our research team.

29:01.323 --> 29:04.785
A couple of projects under way
at the moment.

29:04.785 --> 29:06.287
I don't know if Fleischmann called you,

29:06.287 --> 29:09.123
but I assure you, our finances
are in order and up to date.

29:09.123 --> 29:10.207
Save the accounts.

29:10.207 --> 29:13.294
We're more interested
in who concocted this.

29:13.294 --> 29:15.004
That bottle contained a substance

29:15.004 --> 29:17.089
that was used in a string of poisonings,

29:17.089 --> 29:19.258
and we have reason to believe
it was developed here.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.843
Nothing goes out unless it's passed

29:20.843 --> 29:24.180
15 discrete safety benchmarks
and animal trials.

29:24.180 --> 29:26.348
Any candidates fail animal trials?

29:26.348 --> 29:28.851
This substance targets
the immune system.

29:30.019 --> 29:32.313
The only thing I can think of is Adumark.

29:32.313 --> 29:34.982
It was our golden goose,
but animal trials went...

29:34.982 --> 29:36.734
Well...

29:36.734 --> 29:39.111
"catastrophic" was what I wrote
in the report.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.197
Who conducted those trials?

29:41.197 --> 29:42.615
Dr. Harris was lead.

29:42.615 --> 29:44.700
With what happened
to those test animals

29:44.700 --> 29:47.536
and with press snooping around,
we sidelined the project.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.955
- Where is he now?
- General research meeting.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.999
You passed him on your way in.

29:53.501 --> 29:54.960
Thank you.

30:07.264 --> 30:08.807
This way.

30:14.647 --> 30:16.190
He must've gone down the stairs.

30:16.190 --> 30:18.359
You go after him. I'll call for backup.

30:31.705 --> 30:33.582
Funny statistic.

30:33.582 --> 30:36.710
Most runners go up stairs, not down.

30:40.047 --> 30:42.299
My people have found Wormwood.

30:42.299 --> 30:43.884
Did he give them an antidote?

30:43.884 --> 30:45.386
Not yet, but he will.

30:45.386 --> 30:47.805
The question now
isn't whether we'll live,

30:47.805 --> 30:50.808
but what we'll do
with the gift of living.

30:50.808 --> 30:52.977
Personally, I'm hoping for a few laughs,

30:52.977 --> 30:57.106
some soft kisses,
and peace in our time.

30:57.106 --> 30:59.191
I've already told Izan that's what I want.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.694
Four people are dead,
and you talk peace?

31:01.694 --> 31:03.445
Not until we have the killer.

31:03.445 --> 31:05.573
Not until I have proof that
his family isn't responsible.

31:05.573 --> 31:07.283
My family?

31:07.283 --> 31:11.328
We've always been the victims,
starting with my grandfather.

31:11.328 --> 31:13.747
- He was a good man.
- Whose death was accidental.

31:13.747 --> 31:16.667
The mine collapsed because your
family miswired the charges.

31:16.667 --> 31:18.627
Rocks shifted. It was an accident!

31:18.627 --> 31:23.674
What's done is done,
whether accidentally or on purpose.

31:23.674 --> 31:29.722
After three generations,
it simply does not matter.

31:31.390 --> 31:34.977
Do I have your word
that you did not do this?

31:34.977 --> 31:37.354
- You do.
- And you have mine.

31:37.354 --> 31:40.357
That's enough for me.
Is it enough for you?

31:40.357 --> 31:42.026
I need proof.

31:42.026 --> 31:43.736
How's this?

31:44.194 --> 31:47.197
Michael and your cousin
Gabriella are lovers.

31:48.490 --> 31:49.491
Is this true?

31:50.117 --> 31:53.579
It is,
which is why I want peace.

31:53.579 --> 31:56.457
Because the war has kept us apart.

31:56.457 --> 31:58.542
I'm not responsible for this.

31:59.293 --> 32:00.336
Then who is?

32:00.336 --> 32:01.879
Love.

32:01.879 --> 32:04.673
You just got done saying love
is why he wouldn't do it.

32:04.673 --> 32:06.800
Michael wouldn't, no.

32:06.800 --> 32:12.473
But love in the wrong hands
or hearts... is reckless,

32:12.473 --> 32:17.770
and, in my experience,
as dangerous as any hatred.

32:18.646 --> 32:19.855
That can't be true.

32:23.942 --> 32:26.779
You got the proof you wanted.

32:26.779 --> 32:29.198
It's terrible and tragic,

32:29.198 --> 32:33.243
but you can use it to end
this nonsense once and for all.

32:35.162 --> 32:36.497
Or not.

32:36.497 --> 32:39.124
The decision is yours.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.294
I did it for us.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.797
You killed my father for us?

32:44.797 --> 32:47.341
Sooner or later, the feud
would have killed him,

32:47.341 --> 32:49.051
your father and mine.

32:49.051 --> 32:50.386
It had to stop.

32:50.386 --> 32:52.930
How does this stop anything?

32:52.930 --> 32:56.892
It puts you in charge,
to make peace, to end it.

32:56.892 --> 33:01.689
- End it? You killed four people.
- Can you and Izan make peace?

33:01.689 --> 33:04.650
- That's beside the point.
- That's the only point.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.985
Because it's the only way
we can be together.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.988
And I'm sorry, but to me,
that's the only thing that matters.

33:11.573 --> 33:13.283
I know you feel the same way.

33:17.705 --> 33:19.707
I thought you were different.

33:21.208 --> 33:22.668
I <i>am</i> different.

33:22.793 --> 33:24.503
Yeah.

33:24.503 --> 33:25.587
You're worse.

33:34.430 --> 33:35.556
Lawyer.

33:35.556 --> 33:37.266
You killed four people,

33:37.266 --> 33:39.268
poisoned three others,
and you're asking for a lawyer?

33:39.268 --> 33:40.936
If that's the accusation,

33:40.936 --> 33:42.771
sounds like you answered
your own question.

33:42.771 --> 33:45.065
You know, if my poison

33:45.065 --> 33:47.985
ended up being used
on Raymond Reddington,

33:47.985 --> 33:50.404
I'd want to cooperate
with whoever I could,

33:50.404 --> 33:51.613
just to stay safe.

33:51.613 --> 33:53.240
You're making that up.

33:53.240 --> 33:57.119
And they say his people
can reach anyone anywhere.

33:57.119 --> 33:59.204
You can go to central lockup

33:59.204 --> 34:04.293
and wait to talk to your lawyer
for a day, a week, a month.

34:04.293 --> 34:07.045
Or you can stay
at an FBI black site.

34:07.045 --> 34:10.132
That might be enough to protect
you from Reddington's wrath.

34:13.927 --> 34:15.095
What do you want to know?

34:15.095 --> 34:16.638
Tell us about Adumark.

34:16.638 --> 34:19.266
It's made with a chirality
of two of the normal--

34:22.144 --> 34:23.645
It's sticky.

34:23.645 --> 34:25.689
It adheres to white blood cells.

34:25.689 --> 34:27.566
- That's it.
- That's all it does?

34:27.566 --> 34:29.818
It causes a drug-induced hypersensitivity.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.487
Rather than the body reacting to it,

34:31.487 --> 34:34.114
it tunes the body
to react to the environment.

34:34.114 --> 34:37.159
Any immunological quirks you may have,

34:37.159 --> 34:38.702
they become lethal.

34:39.745 --> 34:40.829
Why sell it?

34:40.829 --> 34:43.832
Saving lives was never the goal.

34:43.832 --> 34:45.834
I wanted wealth, status.

34:45.834 --> 34:48.629
Instead, I got a chemical
whose only use was delayed

34:48.629 --> 34:50.589
and near untraceable death.

34:50.589 --> 34:53.050
Adumark killed my career,

34:53.050 --> 34:55.636
so I stayed at Heliod
for the lab access,

34:55.636 --> 34:57.012
so I could synthesize it
whenever I want.

34:57.012 --> 34:59.681
- We need the antidote.
- No, you don't.

34:59.681 --> 35:02.267
The three people you poisoned do.

35:03.477 --> 35:05.354
You guys don't seem to understand.

35:05.354 --> 35:08.524
It was built
on a blood pressure medication.

35:08.524 --> 35:09.900
So?

35:09.900 --> 35:12.694
So it's processed like
a blood pressure medication.

35:12.694 --> 35:14.488
Kidneys eliminate it through the urine.

35:14.488 --> 35:15.989
You don't want to die?

35:15.989 --> 35:18.784
All you got to do
is wait it out in a clean room.

35:18.784 --> 35:19.993
For how long?

35:19.993 --> 35:22.287
Eighteen, twenty-four hours tops.

35:23.247 --> 35:24.248
That's it?

35:24.248 --> 35:25.332
That's it.

35:25.332 --> 35:26.917
Except for the part
where you thank me

35:26.917 --> 35:28.460
for exposing Reddington.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.963
FBI's most wanted
for God knows how long,

35:30.963 --> 35:33.090
and I'm the one who took him out.

35:35.717 --> 35:37.594
- Did you hear that?
- I did.

35:37.594 --> 35:39.596
By my count,
Reddington and the others

35:39.596 --> 35:41.974
have seven more hours
before they're in the clear.

35:41.974 --> 35:44.351
As long as Reddington stays put,
he should be fine.

35:44.351 --> 35:46.061
Then he's a dead man walking.

35:46.061 --> 35:47.479
Did you speak with Reddington?

35:47.479 --> 35:49.982
I called him like you asked
to tell him to stay put.

35:49.982 --> 35:52.109
He didn't pick up, so I tried Herbie.

35:52.109 --> 35:53.986
He told me that Reddington's gone.

35:53.986 --> 35:55.779
Gone? Gone where?

35:55.779 --> 35:58.740
Well, he didn't say,
just that... he left.

36:02.536 --> 36:04.496
Not to worry. I'm on my way.

36:04.496 --> 36:05.831
I promised I'd be there.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.332
I wouldn't be caught dead
anywhere else.

36:21.388 --> 36:23.098
I don't know
how to come back from this.

36:24.474 --> 36:25.809
Maybe we don't come back.

36:27.144 --> 36:28.812
Maybe we start over.

36:29.897 --> 36:31.023
How?

36:32.065 --> 36:33.108
Forbearance.

37:28.413 --> 37:31.124
Raymond wasn't there.
Have you heard from him?

37:31.124 --> 37:32.876
We have not.

37:32.876 --> 37:34.628
I don't understand Reddington.

37:34.628 --> 37:37.297
He just had to sit tight
for a few more hours.

37:37.297 --> 37:39.675
Why put himself at such risk?

38:31.309 --> 38:33.145
Jonathan.

38:33.145 --> 38:34.980
Can't say I'm surprised to see you.

38:37.024 --> 38:38.650
You asked him about Elizabeth?

38:40.152 --> 38:41.236
I did.

38:42.863 --> 38:45.782
Even after he told me, uh,
about their connection,

38:45.782 --> 38:49.536
I-I didn't want to believe what
you said about him was true.

38:49.536 --> 38:53.623
But the more I looked into
who Agent Keen was...

38:54.666 --> 38:56.501
- She killed the attorney general.
- Mm.

38:56.501 --> 38:58.170
She was a fugitive with Reddington.

38:58.170 --> 39:00.589
We need to pull it down,
and we need to do it now,

39:00.589 --> 39:03.759
and I can't do that
without your help.

39:06.511 --> 39:08.805
What do you need me to do?

39:08.805 --> 39:11.641
<i>♪ Da-da-da... ♪</i>

39:11.641 --> 39:13.727
<i>♪ Da-da-da... ♪</i>

39:25.322 --> 39:26.990
Do you have a death wish?

39:26.990 --> 39:28.575
No, but you must,

39:28.575 --> 39:32.996
or you'd think twice
about sneaking into my home.

39:32.996 --> 39:34.498
Like you sneak into mine?

39:36.333 --> 39:39.461
I rely on
your preternatural calm.

39:39.461 --> 39:43.340
I think you know me well enough
not to rely on mine.

39:44.633 --> 39:46.802
You should be in quarantine.

39:46.802 --> 39:50.472
You should have seen Agnes.

39:50.472 --> 39:53.475
She was heaven.

39:53.475 --> 39:55.685
Absolute heaven.

39:55.685 --> 39:58.146
I would have loved
to have seen her,

39:58.146 --> 40:00.649
but I was a little busy
trying to save your ass.

40:00.649 --> 40:03.985
Which I might not have done
had I known how little you value it.

40:03.985 --> 40:06.571
Has Herbie explained
the problem to you?

40:06.571 --> 40:08.782
How vulnerable you are
for the next few hours?

40:08.782 --> 40:11.201
How you could die from just
about anything you smell

40:11.201 --> 40:12.744
or touch or taste?

40:12.744 --> 40:15.497
Life is risk management, Harold.

40:16.373 --> 40:19.417
Priorities, dangers, promises.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.253
I gave my word to Agnes.

40:21.253 --> 40:23.713
Keeping it is worth the risk.

40:23.713 --> 40:26.466
You have no power against this. None.

40:26.466 --> 40:30.387
After all the precautions
you've taken over the years to survive,

40:30.387 --> 40:32.597
suddenly, you're okay
with putting your life

40:32.597 --> 40:35.016
in the hands of pure dumb luck.

40:35.016 --> 40:36.143
Why?

40:37.811 --> 40:39.271
Did Wormwood talk?

40:39.271 --> 40:40.355
Tell me.

40:42.691 --> 40:44.693
We got a blacklister.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.821
Solved a generational dispute.

40:48.697 --> 40:51.283
Some of us went to the ballet.

40:52.826 --> 40:55.287
That's a good day
in anyone's estimation.

40:55.287 --> 40:56.663
It certainly is in mine.

40:59.082 --> 41:00.584
It's not a game.

41:01.543 --> 41:04.296
And we're not simply associates.

41:04.462 --> 41:05.797
I care about you.

41:06.590 --> 41:09.968
More importantly, Agnes cares about you.

41:10.635 --> 41:12.846
You need to respect that.

41:12.846 --> 41:14.264
I do, Harold.

41:16.641 --> 41:17.767
Very much.

41:19.561 --> 41:21.271
At this time in our lives,

41:21.271 --> 41:23.648
I, for one,
want as many reminders

41:23.648 --> 41:28.236
of the good and the beauty
that this world has to offer.

41:30.906 --> 41:32.073
Like Agnes' ballet?

41:32.073 --> 41:34.409
Like Agnes' ballet.

41:36.286 --> 41:39.122
I can't think of a better reason

41:39.122 --> 41:40.332
to risk my life.

41:40.332 --> 41:41.458
Can you?
