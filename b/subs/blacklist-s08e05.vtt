12:14.817 --> 12:17.111
Since that time,
new information has come to light.

12:17.194 --> 12:19.655
For starters, we now know that Agent Keen

12:19.738 --> 12:23.701
has made a number of cases
based on intel from confidential sources.

12:23.784 --> 12:24.994
A shocking number.

12:25.077 --> 12:28.038
More, in fact,
than any other major case agent.

12:28.122 --> 12:30.124
We'd have to review those numbers.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.835
The vast majority,
if not all, of those cases

12:32.918 --> 12:35.921
were based on intel supplied
by the same individual.

12:36.005 --> 12:39.341
-You believe that based on what?
-[judge] I've read the defendant's papers.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.218
All these cases, Miss Navarro,

12:41.302 --> 12:43.345
can you assure me
there were multiple sources?

12:43.429 --> 12:45.222
We're not able to answer that.

12:45.306 --> 12:48.309
Because if she did, you'd wonder
if there was any informant at all,

12:48.392 --> 12:53.522
since one person couldn't possibly have
such a wide variety of criminal knowledge.

12:53.606 --> 12:57.151
Maybe Agent Keen fabricated
her quote-unquote "source"

12:57.234 --> 12:59.612
to get defendants to cop a plea.

12:59.695 --> 13:03.073
[Navarro] There's been no fabrication
and no evidence to show...

13:03.157 --> 13:07.411
Not yet. But that's why you're here.
I'm not prepared to take your word.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.455
I wanna hear from Agent Keen.

13:09.538 --> 13:13.083
Your Honor, I'm Assistant Director
Harold Cooper of the FBI,

13:13.167 --> 13:15.169
Agent Keen's immediate supervisor.

13:15.252 --> 13:18.589
Unfortunately, she's on assignment
and unable to be here.

13:18.672 --> 13:20.591
Her assignment was to show up.

13:20.674 --> 13:23.093
-That won't be possible.
-[Rovenpor] How convenient.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.179
Your Honor, this is intentional.

13:25.262 --> 13:28.682
How long before she can answer
my questions in person and under oath?

13:28.766 --> 13:32.269
-I don't know, Your Honor.
-That won't cut it, Mr. Cooper.

13:32.353 --> 13:35.981
-Have Keen here by 4 p.m.
-I can't guarantee that, Your Honor.

13:36.065 --> 13:39.485
I can guarantee if she's not here,
I will grant the motion,

13:39.568 --> 13:42.780
and Mr. Veseli may very well be released.

13:49.662 --> 13:50.621
He's here.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.123
Ah.

13:55.251 --> 13:59.129
Red, you should know,
Keen approached me last week.

13:59.213 --> 14:00.673
She said you were dying.

14:01.757 --> 14:03.884
That she's heir apparent

14:03.968 --> 14:05.844
and I should throw in with her.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.429
Did you find anything?

14:07.513 --> 14:08.806
No prints or DNA.

14:08.889 --> 14:12.142
But you said the note was left
by a bank robber,

14:12.226 --> 14:15.980
so I checked it against a database
of information on robberies,

14:16.063 --> 14:18.357
other notes, documents,

14:18.440 --> 14:22.278
and found a handwriting match
to a previous robbery.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.530
[Raymond] Thank you, Cvetko.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.491
For your work and your loyalty.

14:29.618 --> 14:32.371
The Bell Tower heist in '94?

14:33.038 --> 14:34.999
-You know it?
-I do.

14:35.082 --> 14:36.584
And the man who did it.

14:39.253 --> 14:43.173
Three pills, half a glass of water.
Nothing else until I come back.

14:45.175 --> 14:47.261
[dramatic music playing]

14:47.344 --> 14:49.680
-[door opens]
-She's rather charmless.

14:51.140 --> 14:55.311
We both know you didn't come here
for a skip down memory lane.

14:57.771 --> 15:01.108
Two nights ago, I was robbed.
The thief left a note.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.861
The writing matches a note
you gave a teller

15:03.944 --> 15:06.572
during the Bell Tower job.

15:06.655 --> 15:08.324
You think I robbed you?

15:09.325 --> 15:12.494
I take two steps,
I gotta rest for an hour.

15:12.578 --> 15:15.247
I can't even steal my wallet
out of my pocket.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.333
[cell phone ringing]

15:18.042 --> 15:19.293
Sorry.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.296
Anything?

15:22.379 --> 15:25.174
We went through the names
of everyone with a safe-deposit box.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.176
Two weeks ago, Terese Krissoff opened one.

15:27.259 --> 15:30.095
The real Miss Krissoff died
three months ago.

15:30.179 --> 15:33.182
The impostor opened an account
with a fake social security number

15:33.265 --> 15:34.892
so she could case the room.

15:34.975 --> 15:37.811
The robbers avoided surveillance
when they broke into your box.

15:37.895 --> 15:41.190
We pulled a photo of her
when she was prepping the job.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.275
We sent you a copy of the image.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.653
<i>We can't make a positive ID. Can you?</i>

15:49.156 --> 15:51.450
No, but I may know someone who can.

15:54.620 --> 15:58.082
I was once held captive
by the Shining Path.

15:58.165 --> 16:02.795
Three months
of unrelenting heat and humidity

16:02.878 --> 16:04.505
in the Peruvian jungle,

16:04.588 --> 16:07.508
mixed with the occasional round
of electroshock.

16:07.591 --> 16:10.761
All in all,
it was a rather unpleasant experience

16:10.844 --> 16:12.346
but for my cellmate,

16:12.429 --> 16:17.059
a delightfully monkish, bookish,
Polish aid worker,

16:17.142 --> 16:21.730
who was also inexplicably something
of a handwriting expert.

16:22.356 --> 16:26.527
While fending off the daily onslaught
of rhinoceros beetles,

16:26.610 --> 16:30.280
he would hold forth
on why a child's handwriting

16:30.364 --> 16:34.076
is often nearly identical
to that of at least one,

16:34.159 --> 16:39.623
if not a little of both of his
or her parents' handwriting.

16:39.707 --> 16:43.585
Apparently,
the similarity isn't genetic at all.

16:43.669 --> 16:47.297
Just... subconscious imitation.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.012
I didn't know you had a daughter.

16:54.388 --> 16:57.891
I did once, but not anymore.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.478
I owe you an apology.

17:02.354 --> 17:05.607
It's not your handwriting
on the note, it's hers.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.861
You didn't rob me. She did.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.405
[Abe] No, that's impossible.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.282
Tell me where she is.

17:17.661 --> 17:18.746
Where is she?

17:20.080 --> 17:23.500
Jennifer and I are estranged.

17:24.251 --> 17:27.880
Now, I got those photos from her mother.

17:27.963 --> 17:31.216
She and I agreed
that Jen should live with her

17:31.300 --> 17:34.261
so she could have a life, a good life.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.805
An honest life.

17:38.432 --> 17:39.767
Where is she, Abe?

17:41.393 --> 17:43.187
I'm not gonna ask you again.

17:43.854 --> 17:47.524
I can't tell you because I don't know.

17:48.776 --> 17:51.737
But if you're right,
that my baby's a thief...

17:52.654 --> 17:55.532
go ahead, you may as well kill me now...

17:56.075 --> 17:58.660
'cause I ain't got nothing to live for.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.085
[dramatic music playing]

18:06.168 --> 18:09.254
The photo Aram sent,
were you able to ID the woman?

18:09.338 --> 18:11.131
Yes. The lead bore fruit.

18:11.215 --> 18:14.176
So, you know
who Elizabeth hired to rob you?

18:14.259 --> 18:17.763
-I do. We're looking for her now.
-We need to look together.

18:17.846 --> 18:21.600
After all these years,
I'd think you'd know I don't do halfsies.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.936
If we don't find Elizabeth by 4 p.m.,

18:24.019 --> 18:26.939
the case we made
against Veseli will fall apart.

18:27.022 --> 18:29.066
-Alban, The Freelancer?
<i>-Yes.</i>

18:29.149 --> 18:32.111
And he has a new attorney
who claims we violated his civil rights

18:32.194 --> 18:34.446
by not disclosing you were our source.

18:34.530 --> 18:38.617
<i>If Elizabeth doesn't appear in court,</i>
<i>the judge may let him walk.</i>

18:38.700 --> 18:41.578
So, are we doing halfsies or what?

18:43.831 --> 18:47.042
The woman we're looking for
is Jennifer Anne Moores.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.795
She's the daughter of Abraham Moores.

18:49.878 --> 18:52.214
Reddington claims Moores
is a retired bank robber.

18:52.297 --> 18:53.674
Like father, like daughter.

18:53.757 --> 18:56.969
Moores was arrested in '98,
did nine years and retired.

18:57.052 --> 18:59.638
Or maybe passed on the family business.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.390
Reddington doesn't think so.

19:01.473 --> 19:05.102
The last thing the father wanted was for
his daughter to follow in his footsteps.

19:05.185 --> 19:07.104
He told her that, they became estranged.

19:07.187 --> 19:09.273
Reddington doesn't think
he knows where she is.

19:09.356 --> 19:13.735
The DMV database shows
637 Jennifer Anne Moores.

19:14.319 --> 19:18.365
But once I cross-check that
against the photo we got from the bank...

19:18.448 --> 19:19.283
[computer beeps]

19:19.366 --> 19:21.243
-[Park] We got her address.
-[Aram] And occupation.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.703
Alleged occupation.

19:22.786 --> 19:25.789
I doubt she'll list "bank robber"
on her mortgage application.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.584
-I want teams at her home and work.
-Should we bring her in?

19:28.667 --> 19:31.795
No, I want her followed.
Hopefully, to Elizabeth Keen.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.047
[camera shutter clicking]

19:36.258 --> 19:39.511
-[static crackling]
-[garbled voice over comm]

19:41.138 --> 19:42.639
[Ressler] Aram, what's up with your audio?

19:42.723 --> 19:46.018
[Aram] I don't know. I'm getting some
nasty interference. Hang on.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.023
Second call in five minutes.
What's she up to?

19:51.607 --> 19:54.443
The whole thing's
a double-edged sword, isn't it?

19:54.526 --> 19:55.777
What whole thing?

19:55.861 --> 19:58.780
This business with Keen
and The Freelancer, him getting out.

19:58.864 --> 20:02.659
The guy derailed a train,
killed 60 innocents to hide one murder.

20:02.743 --> 20:05.704
-He's not getting out.
-If Keen doesn't show, he could walk.

20:05.787 --> 20:09.291
On the other hand, if she shows,
the killer stays in prison,

20:09.374 --> 20:12.419
but we're forced to arrest Keen.
Double-edged sword.

20:12.502 --> 20:15.339
At this point,
all we have are bad options.

20:15.422 --> 20:17.674
Arresting her may be
the best bad one we've got.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.009
[Park] <i>We haven't been able to.</i>

20:19.092 --> 20:22.554
But the way things are going,
it might be the only way to keep her safe.

20:23.597 --> 20:25.182
[Ressler] Who's this here?

20:25.891 --> 20:28.393
-Think he's part of her crew?
-Aram, where's that audio?

20:28.477 --> 20:30.729
[Aram] Nasty frequency interference.
Hang on.

20:30.812 --> 20:32.564
[suspenseful music playing]

20:34.441 --> 20:37.611
Hang on, we got someone else now,
female to the south.

20:37.694 --> 20:40.989
-Aram, we need that audio.
-Okay, just, um-- All right.

20:41.073 --> 20:44.368
Give me 20 seconds
and I will get you sound.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.454
[dramatic music playing]

20:50.916 --> 20:52.459
What the hell is he doing?

20:54.002 --> 20:57.506
We're not supposed to meet
until I deliver the drive.

20:57.589 --> 20:58.924
We have a problem.

20:59.007 --> 21:01.343
Reddington showed up
at your father's apartment.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.929
[Jennifer] Raymond Reddington?
You're sure it was him?

21:04.012 --> 21:06.556
-[Raf] I knew this was a mistake.
-Let me think.

21:08.141 --> 21:09.226
[Raf] What's the move, Jen?

21:14.564 --> 21:16.525
Oh, excuse me. I'm so sorry.

21:16.608 --> 21:18.568
Did you guys see a woman walk by?

21:18.652 --> 21:24.241
About 5'7", dark curly hair,
super smart and funny, so really...

21:24.324 --> 21:27.494
-She's really funny.
-We haven't seen anyone, sorry.

21:27.577 --> 21:28.870
Thanks, anyway. It's just, um...

21:30.122 --> 21:33.542
I can't remember if I was supposed
to meet her at 1, and I'm super early,

21:33.625 --> 21:36.503
or noon, and I just, like,
totally stood her up.

21:36.586 --> 21:38.839
You could just text her?

21:38.922 --> 21:40.966
Text her? I could text her. I'll text her.

21:41.591 --> 21:43.885
Oh, I'm sorry. Such an idiot.

21:44.511 --> 21:45.762
Sorry. There.

21:47.931 --> 21:49.099
[softly] Oh, my God.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.601
-[Aram] Spoonful of sugar.
-[Jennifer] It's fine.

21:52.644 --> 21:53.895
Okay. Thanks.

21:57.774 --> 21:59.693
What exactly did Reddington say?

21:59.776 --> 22:02.446
He asked your dad about you.
About the job.

22:02.529 --> 22:05.574
If he finds us,
you know he'll kill us, right?

22:05.657 --> 22:10.829
What do you wanna do?
Call Reddington, say you're sorry?

22:10.912 --> 22:12.205
What's done is done.

22:12.289 --> 22:14.791
We need to split up, lay low.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.669
[Jennifer] <i>Yes, but not until after</i>
<i>we deliver the drive to Givens</i>

22:17.753 --> 22:19.629
<i>and we get paid.</i>

22:19.713 --> 22:21.965
-Givens?
-You know that name?

22:22.049 --> 22:24.760
Carolyn Givens,
it's one of Keen's aliases.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.055
Carolyn.

22:28.138 --> 22:30.974
It's me. I need to move up the meet.

22:31.058 --> 22:34.102

[Ressler] <i>Jennifer's making the drop</i>
<i>to Keen today.</i>

22:45.280 --> 22:46.615
You have the location?

22:46.698 --> 22:48.992
Rock Creek Park.
We're getting units in place now.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.828
The moment she's in custody,
bring her here.

22:51.912 --> 22:55.040
Agent Ressler,
let's keep this an internal matter.

22:55.123 --> 22:58.668
We can notify Reddington
once Keen's safe and in our custody.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.802
[dramatic music playing]

23:10.180 --> 23:11.515
We've got movement.

23:12.015 --> 23:13.433
Unit 1, hang back a bit.

23:28.281 --> 23:29.533
Did you see that?

-All teams, report.
-[man 1] <i>Unit 1, clear.</i>

I'd be dead now.

-This has gotta be it.

-Where are you? I have your drive.
<i>-Slow down. Listen.</i>

[Park] FBI! Hands in the air! Hands!

24:36.933 --> 24:39.102
-[woman] What's going on? What did I do?
-[man] Stand still.

24:39.186 --> 24:40.270
Don't move.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.731
Put your hands behind your back.

24:42.814 --> 24:46.484
-Park, what have you got?
-Nothing. Pack's empty.

24:46.568 --> 24:48.028
Empty? You're sure?

24:50.405 --> 24:51.740
The coffee cup.

24:52.282 --> 24:53.533
Where's the cup?

25:14.971 --> 25:17.057
[dramatic music playing]

25:17.140 --> 25:18.558
I know you.

25:19.434 --> 25:20.810
How you operate.

25:20.894 --> 25:22.020
She'll be here.

25:22.103 --> 25:26.149
The way you handle Reddington,
letting him think he's handling you.

25:26.233 --> 25:29.152
The velvet shiv you use
to get your agents to do what you need

25:29.236 --> 25:32.030
in a way that makes them feel
like they can do what they want.

25:32.113 --> 25:34.199
Harold, you are a wonder to behold.

25:34.824 --> 25:37.494
No one could've done what you've done.

25:37.577 --> 25:39.746
Yet here you are,
steaming up like a tea kettle,

25:39.829 --> 25:41.248
and I want to know why.

25:41.957 --> 25:44.918
-What's going on with Keen?
-I can't tell you that.

25:45.001 --> 25:48.588
I can't protect you if you don't.
Believe me when I tell you

25:48.672 --> 25:51.424
if the criminals you've arrested
start getting released,

25:51.508 --> 25:55.345
you'll need more protection than
a pair of teens in the back of papa's car.

25:59.432 --> 26:02.352
Let me get this straight.
I ordered Keen to appear, she didn't.

26:02.435 --> 26:04.646
I gave a her second chance to comply,
she hasn't.

26:04.729 --> 26:06.606
Your Honor, may we approach?

26:12.195 --> 26:15.615
-Who's this?
-Cynthia Panabaker, White House Counsel.

26:15.699 --> 26:19.369
If we could talk to Your Honor ex parte,
make a proffer for your ears only,

26:19.452 --> 26:20.870
maybe we can move things along.

26:20.954 --> 26:23.957
-Absolutely not. Your Honor--
-It's the only way this happens.

26:24.040 --> 26:25.166
You're in the dark.

26:25.250 --> 26:28.545
You want to release a murderer
because you don't have information? Do it.

26:28.628 --> 26:33.133
See how that works out for you.
Or grant our request, step into the light.

26:36.011 --> 26:38.221
I'll clear the courtroom,
hear the proffer.

26:38.305 --> 26:39.514
Relax, Mr. Rovenpor.

26:39.597 --> 26:43.435
Once I hear it, I'll make a ruling
on what stays privileged.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.063
-Bailiff, please clear the court.
-[bailiff] All rise.

26:47.147 --> 26:49.149
The court is in recess.

26:55.947 --> 26:57.157
This better be good.

26:57.699 --> 27:01.328
Raymond Reddington is
Agent Keen's confidential informant.

27:01.411 --> 27:03.788
[Panabaker] That's right.
The president is aware.

27:03.872 --> 27:07.709
So is a handful of federal agents,
and now the list includes you.

27:07.792 --> 27:12.088
You're telling me the U.S. government
is in business with Reddington?

27:12.172 --> 27:15.175
You're not the first person
to express some concern.

27:15.258 --> 27:17.177
I'm not concerned. I'm offended.

27:17.260 --> 27:19.637
You don't find
many swans swimming in the sewer.

27:19.721 --> 27:22.223
Reddington's the source
behind these cases,

27:22.307 --> 27:26.186
feeding Keen a diet of major criminals
for the last seven years?

27:26.269 --> 27:29.481
You can understand why we need
to keep that from being exposed.

27:29.564 --> 27:32.359
We didn't want you to think
we were refusing to comply...

27:32.442 --> 27:35.320
You don't think you had an obligation
to inform those defendants

27:35.403 --> 27:39.157
the source of the intel used against them
was the most prolific criminal mastermind

27:39.240 --> 27:41.659
-in modern history?
-Express your distaste all you want.

27:41.743 --> 27:44.287
But three presidents have come
to a different conclusion.

27:44.371 --> 27:46.331
We didn't come back
for your moral judgment.

27:46.414 --> 27:49.209
Then here's my legal judgment.
I find anything the FBI learned

27:49.292 --> 27:51.378
from Reddington,
with regard to this defendant,

27:51.461 --> 27:53.254
to be unreliable as a matter of law.

27:53.338 --> 27:56.883
All evidence that came from him or was
the fruit of the relationship with him

27:56.966 --> 27:59.677
-should've been declared inadmissible.
-Your Honor, please--

27:59.761 --> 28:02.889
Absent that evidence, does the government
have proof to make its case?

28:02.972 --> 28:06.393
-We need time before answering that.
-Too bad. Time's up.

28:06.476 --> 28:09.145
I'm granting the motion
to withdraw his plea,

28:09.229 --> 28:12.524
and I am forced to dismiss
the charges against him.

28:12.607 --> 28:15.527
-Don't do this.
-I'm not doing it, Mr. Cooper.

28:15.610 --> 28:16.736
You are.

28:25.995 --> 28:30.125
-He's in for a pleasant surprise.
-It'll take hours to process him out.

28:30.208 --> 28:32.919
-I'll slow that down.
-What good will that do?

28:33.002 --> 28:34.379
[Panabaker] I'll take another look.

28:34.462 --> 28:37.841
It's a long shot, but maybe there's enough
to hold him on another charge.

28:37.924 --> 28:39.884
In the meantime, find Keen.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.636
We have Jennifer Moores in custody.

28:41.720 --> 28:45.473
I don't know who Miss Moores is
or how she can lead you to Keen,

28:45.557 --> 28:47.809
but if you don't bring her in,
you're on your own.

28:48.393 --> 28:51.604
If this blows up,
I won't be jumping on any grenades.

28:55.191 --> 28:58.319
-[Aram] Well, it wasn't a total loss.
-[Raymond] <i>Did you get Elizabeth?</i>

28:58.403 --> 29:00.196
Well, no, not exactly.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.240
Was your goal to get Elizabeth?

29:02.907 --> 29:04.451
Okay, it was a total loss.

29:04.534 --> 29:06.619
But on the plus side,
we got her associates.

29:06.703 --> 29:08.788
I sent their photos
to see if you can ID them.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.206
Now you want my help?

29:10.290 --> 29:13.585
Harold has
a unique definition of "halfsies."

29:13.668 --> 29:15.712
Halfsies? I love halfsies.

29:15.795 --> 29:17.046
Especially for food.

29:19.591 --> 29:22.135
Tell him that I don't recognize anyone

29:22.218 --> 29:24.554
and that the next time he has intel,

29:24.637 --> 29:28.558
I expect him to share it with me
before it's squandered, not after.

29:36.024 --> 29:37.400
You lied to me, Abe.

29:38.276 --> 29:40.779
Raymond, I told you what I knew.

29:41.404 --> 29:42.238
Really?

29:44.574 --> 29:47.118
Why didn't you tell me about your nurse?

29:47.202 --> 29:49.871
[dramatic music playing]

30:00.048 --> 30:01.508
Let's try this again.

30:03.551 --> 30:05.386
Talk to me about your daughter.

30:10.350 --> 30:12.685
[suspenseful music playing]

30:14.646 --> 30:17.398
No pressure, but getting Moores
to give us a lead on Keen

30:17.482 --> 30:19.943
is all that stands
between Veseli and his release.

30:20.026 --> 30:22.070
-I thought the judge ordered his release.
-He did.

30:22.153 --> 30:25.073
Panabaker can keep him from being
processed out before day's end.

30:25.156 --> 30:28.034
If we can find Keen by then,
maybe we can get the order stayed.

30:28.117 --> 30:31.538
Why don't we start
by talking about your options here?

30:31.621 --> 30:34.040
-How about the lawyer option?
-We can do that.

30:34.123 --> 30:36.084
They'll tell you
you're looking at 20 years.

30:36.167 --> 30:38.920
Or they can tell me
that without any evidence or witnesses,

30:39.003 --> 30:40.672
I should keep my mouth shut.

30:40.755 --> 30:43.758
Yeah. You're right.
We don't have any witnesses.

30:43.842 --> 30:47.053
But what we do have are your friends
that we picked up.

30:47.136 --> 30:49.806
-Your coconspirators.
-[Silvina] Coconspirator?

30:49.889 --> 30:51.766
I don't know what you're talking about.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.227
How could I be a coconspirator
if I don't know her?

30:54.310 --> 30:55.186
[Park] She knows you.

30:55.270 --> 30:58.606
At least she seemed to when we recorded
the three of you at True Café.

30:59.649 --> 31:00.817
I'm done talking.

31:00.900 --> 31:03.820
Raf's not. Raf's got plenty to say.

31:03.903 --> 31:08.116
About you, Jennifer,
how you met through her father...

31:08.199 --> 31:10.577
-That's a lie.
-No, it's the truth.

31:10.660 --> 31:13.246
Silvina spent every day with him.
She's his nurse.

31:13.329 --> 31:15.874
How could they not know each other?
Did Silvina say that?

31:15.957 --> 31:17.292
Leave my father out of this.

31:17.375 --> 31:20.545
Your father is a legendary thief
and a safecracker.

31:20.628 --> 31:22.672
You don't expect us
to overlook that, do you?

31:22.755 --> 31:24.173
He went to prison when I was 7.

31:24.257 --> 31:26.050
Okay. Enough already.

31:26.134 --> 31:27.427
She's your daughter.

31:27.510 --> 31:29.470
I never wanted this life for her.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.764
She's the first thing
you think of every morning.

31:31.848 --> 31:34.934
Which is why I thought it best
to stay away from her,

31:35.018 --> 31:36.644
even after I got out of prison.

31:36.728 --> 31:37.979
I cut ties.

31:38.688 --> 31:41.065
You can't imagine how hard that is.

31:41.149 --> 31:44.152
For this conversation, let's assume I can.

31:44.235 --> 31:45.236
[Jennifer] <i>I hated the man.</i>

31:45.320 --> 31:48.156
He walked out of my life. He abandoned me.

31:48.239 --> 31:50.325
Till one day, I walked back in.

31:50.950 --> 31:52.660
Not to be with her, you know?

31:53.202 --> 31:54.412
Not to talk.

31:55.246 --> 31:56.122
Just--

31:56.706 --> 31:58.291
Just to see her.

31:58.374 --> 31:59.709
And what did you see?

31:59.792 --> 32:03.087
I saw my kid crack the VaultSafe 200

32:03.171 --> 32:07.592
of a two-bit meth dealer
in under four minutes.

32:07.675 --> 32:11.262
She was unrefined, a little rushed...

32:11.888 --> 32:13.348
but she had the touch.

32:13.431 --> 32:17.352
Even if I knew where he was,
I wouldn't talk.

32:17.435 --> 32:18.394
He's an old man.

32:18.478 --> 32:21.814
I should have called the police then.
[chuckles]

32:21.898 --> 32:23.441
But she was your child.

32:23.524 --> 32:27.195
I figured I had something to teach her,
to share with her.

32:27.278 --> 32:28.905
A reason to be in her life.

32:28.988 --> 32:30.490
Is that what he told you?

32:31.282 --> 32:32.200
He's lying.

32:32.283 --> 32:34.619
[Ressler] I think he's still involved
in your life.

32:34.702 --> 32:38.331
In fact, Raf says he's the one
who selects the targets.

32:38.414 --> 32:39.499
[Abe] <i>Of course I did.</i>

32:39.582 --> 32:42.377
She needed marks
who wouldn't report the crime,

32:42.460 --> 32:43.878
and I knew where to find them.

32:43.962 --> 32:46.339
-You certainly found me.
-No, wait.

32:46.422 --> 32:48.967
I told her that you were off-limits.

32:49.717 --> 32:52.136
I did, Raymond, but she wouldn't listen.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.430
Because of the money.
It was a lot of money.

32:54.514 --> 32:57.684
-The job was a contract.
-Yes. A woman.

32:58.393 --> 33:00.603
-Some American.
-Tell me about her.

33:00.687 --> 33:03.940
Only on one condition.
You leave my father out of this.

33:04.023 --> 33:05.274
Tell me about the woman.

33:05.358 --> 33:06.943
[Abe] They met through an acquaintance.

33:07.026 --> 33:09.445
Jennifer said
she was laying low after a job.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.364
Cape Town. Didn't have anywhere to go...

33:11.447 --> 33:13.449
But Jen found this safe house.

33:13.533 --> 33:17.704
Part of a network, sanctuaries
for criminals on every continent.

33:17.787 --> 33:20.999
Anyway, the woman who runs it,
her name's Vee.

33:21.082 --> 33:22.542
She approached me.

33:22.625 --> 33:26.462
Said she had a client at another
safe house who needed a job done.

33:26.546 --> 33:29.882
Said she was raiding a deposit box
and had to be done quickly,

33:29.966 --> 33:33.761
so she and Jennifer met in D.C.,
talked about the job.

33:33.845 --> 33:37.640
She said it was personal,
that she was targeting Reddington.

33:37.724 --> 33:41.561
She said you were more vulnerable
than anyone might believe

33:41.644 --> 33:43.896
and that she was building an alliance.

33:43.980 --> 33:46.774
And when this was over,
when Reddington is dead...

33:47.316 --> 33:48.276
she'd be in my debt.

33:48.359 --> 33:49.819
[Abe] <i>I told her not to do it.</i>

33:49.902 --> 33:52.864
But this woman, whoever she is...

33:53.573 --> 33:56.659
she had on blinders, she had money,

33:56.743 --> 33:58.619
and she was persuasive.

33:58.703 --> 33:59.871
When they met...

34:01.205 --> 34:03.166
where the woman was laying low...

34:04.000 --> 34:06.210
-do you know where that was?
-[Jennifer] <i>Of course I do.</i>

34:06.294 --> 34:07.545
And I can tell you.

34:08.337 --> 34:10.757
But again, I want assurances.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.675
You keep my father out of this.

34:12.759 --> 34:15.344
Raymond, lay this at my feet,

34:15.428 --> 34:16.763
not at Jennifer's.

34:16.846 --> 34:18.306
She's just a kid.

34:18.973 --> 34:20.016
My girl.

34:21.350 --> 34:22.268
Your girl.

34:23.352 --> 34:24.729
My baby girl.

34:29.776 --> 34:33.154
We got it. Keen's safe house,
it's an address in Deanwood.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.073
-We're sending units now.
-Wait.

34:35.615 --> 34:38.576
-Reddington, what? Text me the address.
-[Raymond] <i>Greetings.</i>

34:38.659 --> 34:41.496
Calling to see how your team is doing
with the prisoners.

34:41.579 --> 34:45.208
They have invoked their right
to counsel, refusing to talk.

34:45.291 --> 34:47.919
-Predictably unfortunate.
<i>-Have you heard differently?</i>

34:48.002 --> 34:51.380
-Any news on your end?
<i>-I wish I had something to tell you.</i>

34:51.464 --> 34:53.841
Let me know
if your prisoners decide to talk.

34:53.925 --> 34:54.759
I'll do that.

34:55.259 --> 34:56.427
You're going alone?

34:56.511 --> 35:00.014
It's probably hubris,
but I might be able to reach her.

35:02.266 --> 35:04.268
[dramatic music playing]

35:11.567 --> 35:14.278
Agent Keen? It's Harold Cooper. I'm alone.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.490
I just want to talk.

35:19.992 --> 35:20.868
[knocking]

35:21.494 --> 35:22.995
Open the door, Elizabeth.

35:27.834 --> 35:28.876
[dramatic music playing]

35:28.960 --> 35:32.630
I'm afraid we're too late, Harold.
It appears she's already gone.

35:39.637 --> 35:42.431
The photos we sent,
you said you didn't recognize anyone.

35:42.515 --> 35:44.392
-That wasn't true, was it?
-[Raymond] No.

35:44.475 --> 35:48.146
Silvina Rosario works for Abraham Moores.

35:48.229 --> 35:51.065
Once I saw her in the photos,
I knew Abe had lied

35:51.149 --> 35:54.485
and could easily be persuaded
to tell me what he knew.

35:54.569 --> 35:59.365
If you'd shared that with us sooner,
Elizabeth wouldn't have eluded us.

35:59.448 --> 36:02.785
Sins, stones and glass houses, Harold.

36:02.869 --> 36:05.580
Neither of us have played fair
with the other.

36:05.663 --> 36:11.711
Now, seeing as how your job description is
to play fair and mine is to not,

36:11.794 --> 36:15.548
then an argument could be made
that you're more at fault than I,

36:15.631 --> 36:16.591

36:16.674 --> 36:20.011
Elizabeth's gone.
She's taken something of mine with her.

36:20.094 --> 36:23.431
I couldn't be less interested
in what she stole from you.

36:23.514 --> 36:26.517
My concern is her well-being
and getting her back to help her heal

36:26.601 --> 36:29.270

when you killed her mother.

She's responsible for it, not me.

36:36.986 --> 36:40.489
I suppose you also think she's responsible
for The Freelancer's release,

36:40.573 --> 36:44.493
which, now that we're here and she's not,
is guaranteed to happen.

36:44.577 --> 36:48.122
She's not only responsible for it,
it's what she wants.

36:48.915 --> 36:49.749

One day, Elizabeth steals
millions of dollars from me.

unless Elizabeth Keen

37:03.012 --> 37:05.389
