WEBVTT

00:17.608 --> 00:20.232
- Can I get some help, please?
- Can you hear me?

00:23.097 --> 00:25.237
Ma'am?

00:25.237 --> 00:27.273
Opening airway.

00:27.273 --> 00:28.861
Look, listen, and feel
for 10 seconds.

00:28.861 --> 00:32.278
One, two, three...

00:32.278 --> 00:34.280
...four, five--

00:37.490 --> 00:39.527
Okay.
Let's turn her on my count.

00:41.494 --> 00:44.428
Two, three. Okay.

00:44.428 --> 00:47.397
You with us?

00:47.397 --> 00:48.501
Nod if you're with me.

00:51.332 --> 00:53.368
This is gonna help you breathe.

01:12.146 --> 01:14.803
- Focus, please...
- Four units...

01:19.670 --> 01:22.777
Eyes on me, Mama. Eyes on me.

01:22.777 --> 01:25.400
Your baby's gonna be fine.
I promise you.

01:25.400 --> 01:26.746
What about me?

01:26.746 --> 01:29.680
- What was that, Mama?
- What about me?

01:29.680 --> 01:31.475
Pressure. Come on. Let's go.

01:31.475 --> 01:33.305
Suction. I've got it.

01:33.305 --> 01:35.238
Need hands over here.
The baby's not breathing.

01:35.238 --> 01:36.549
- Okay. Okay.

01:36.549 --> 01:38.724
I can't see.

01:42.693 --> 01:44.730
She's seizing again.

04:31.103 --> 04:33.105
<i>Where are you?</i>

04:33.105 --> 04:35.694
I'm gonna ask.

04:35.694 --> 04:37.489
I'm asking right now.

04:37.489 --> 04:39.318
Uh, Rose?

04:39.318 --> 04:43.080
I've asked you to put
your phone on silent.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.013
It's just set for emergencies.

04:47.153 --> 04:48.879
So, I have an emergency.

04:48.879 --> 04:50.743
Th-There was an incident
at Bradley's school.

04:50.743 --> 04:54.816
He bit a kid.
Can I ask a favor?

04:54.816 --> 04:57.405
I can't stay late.
I have plans.

04:57.405 --> 04:59.856
- Rose, I need to leave.
- Where is your wife?

04:59.856 --> 05:01.513
She's already at the school.

05:01.513 --> 05:04.481
- Then why do you need to leave?
- Excuse me?

05:04.481 --> 05:06.103
If she's already there,
you don't need to leave.

05:06.103 --> 05:09.348
You're choosing to.

05:09.348 --> 05:11.626
Yeah, I'll be done
in about an hour.

05:11.626 --> 05:13.559
I'll be there as soon as I can.

05:13.559 --> 05:15.906
Hello? Honey?

05:15.906 --> 05:17.874
Hello?

05:26.710 --> 05:29.817
- Hmm?

05:29.817 --> 05:32.475
Why don't you just lie down
in the lounge?

05:32.475 --> 05:34.442
'Cause the floor's softer here.

05:34.442 --> 05:38.101
It's unsanitary.
Come on, let's go.

05:38.101 --> 05:41.898
I'm here for you.
-  Oh, God.

05:41.898 --> 05:44.418
- I know.

05:44.418 --> 05:46.420
- Yeah.

05:46.420 --> 05:48.422
- I'm so tired.
- Mm.

05:48.422 --> 05:50.182
How come you don't look tired?

05:50.182 --> 05:52.633
Okay. Alright, checking.

05:52.633 --> 05:53.841
- Mommy!
- Okay.

05:53.841 --> 05:56.533
Hey, baby! Wa-pa!

05:56.533 --> 05:58.501
What's happening?
- Kiss on the lips.

05:58.501 --> 05:59.881
Mwah!

05:59.881 --> 06:02.574
So, how was your day?

06:02.574 --> 06:04.023
We played
"What Time Is It, Mr. Fox?"

06:04.023 --> 06:05.818
- You did?
- We made flowers.

06:05.818 --> 06:07.510
We sang "Open Shut Them."

06:07.510 --> 06:09.063
I made candy necklaces.

06:09.063 --> 06:11.755
I peed.
And I played L.O.L.s.

06:11.755 --> 06:13.688
And I read a book.

06:13.688 --> 06:16.484
It was about spiders.
- Oh, yeah?

06:16.484 --> 06:19.142
- And Anansi was a spider.
- Oh, was she now?

06:19.142 --> 06:20.730
That's good.

06:20.730 --> 06:21.903
You miss this?

06:21.903 --> 06:23.698
I miss the little voices.

06:23.698 --> 06:25.804
This is gonna take a minute.

06:25.804 --> 06:27.150
Yeah? Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.

06:27.150 --> 06:28.600
- All right.
- Bye, "Lee-lee."

06:28.600 --> 06:30.671
Bye!

06:30.671 --> 06:32.811
So, Anansi was a spider.

06:32.811 --> 06:35.089
How about this apple
that you did not eat, huh?

06:35.089 --> 06:37.574
- Can we get a spider?
- Aren't spiders scary?

06:37.574 --> 06:39.473
- No, they're crawly.
- Oh, yeah?

06:39.473 --> 06:40.888
What? How? Crawly how?
Like that?

06:40.888 --> 06:42.821
And like this? And like this?
And like this?

06:42.821 --> 06:45.513
And like-- Ohh! Ohh!

06:58.112 --> 07:00.148
Lee-Lee!

07:02.288 --> 07:05.637
Hands to yourself.
- I like her dress.

07:05.637 --> 07:08.191
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

07:08.191 --> 07:10.193
Come on.

07:13.265 --> 07:15.854
- Mommy?
- Yes, baby?

07:15.854 --> 07:18.891
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Of course.

07:18.891 --> 07:21.549
I'm not getting
enough attention.

07:49.543 --> 07:54.720
I'll have the Cobb salad,
no bacon, no chicken.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.826
And no egg.

08:01.037 --> 08:03.211
I would have eaten your bacon.

08:07.630 --> 08:09.770
You shouldn't.

08:09.770 --> 08:12.186
Why not?

08:12.186 --> 08:13.946
I would guess you have
a buildup of plaque

08:13.946 --> 08:15.948
in your systemic arteries.

08:17.950 --> 08:20.263
Right.

08:22.886 --> 08:25.613
Hey.

08:25.613 --> 08:28.340
Come here.

08:35.830 --> 08:38.764
I'd like to masturbate you
in the bathroom.

08:54.815 --> 08:56.092
I-I don't have any money.

08:56.092 --> 08:58.922
- I told you not to look.
- Oh, sorry.

09:05.895 --> 09:08.829
Ahh. Ahh.

09:12.867 --> 09:14.869
What is that?
- A sex toy.

09:14.869 --> 09:17.182
Don't look or I'll stop.
- Okay. O--

09:27.986 --> 09:30.091
Wow!

09:30.091 --> 09:32.887
Give me your hand.

09:32.887 --> 09:35.165
- Ow! What the hell?

09:41.793 --> 09:43.726
Have a good night.

09:43.726 --> 09:47.039

Just five more minutes.

12:26.371 --> 12:29.581
Oh, shit.

12:32.895 --> 12:34.034
Time to get up.

12:34.034 --> 12:36.312
- No.
- Up, Lilita, up.

12:36.312 --> 12:38.348
- I don't feel good.
- I heard that one before.

12:38.348 --> 12:40.799
<i>Levántate.</i> Come on.
You got five minutes.

12:45.424 --> 12:51.948
Shit.

12:51.948 --> 12:54.088
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

12:57.022 --> 12:58.990
Pauline? It's Celie.

13:03.926 --> 13:05.893
Could you take her today, please?

13:05.893 --> 13:08.206
I'm so sorry,
but she's not feeling good.

13:08.206 --> 13:09.932
Oh, of course, sweetie.
Come here.

13:09.932 --> 13:11.312
- No, no, no.
- Come on, Lila.

13:11.312 --> 13:13.004
It's Pauline. Baby, please.

13:13.004 --> 13:14.971
I-- I'm so late.
I got to go.

13:14.971 --> 13:16.145
Lila! Stop!

13:18.492 --> 13:20.252
Come on.
- Unh-unh.

13:20.252 --> 13:21.322
Alright.
If you're gonna be like that,

13:21.322 --> 13:23.324
then I'm just gonna go.

13:23.324 --> 13:26.880
No! No!

13:26.880 --> 13:28.433
No, no, no!

13:31.850 --> 13:33.990
- Going down.
- I'm at work, <i>mamita.</i>

13:33.990 --> 13:36.993
I can't talk.

13:36.993 --> 13:39.064
I know, sweetie, <i>pero--</i>

13:39.064 --> 13:42.171
Why are we going down?

13:42.171 --> 13:44.311
Pauline's gonna take
great care of you.

13:46.175 --> 13:47.659
Sweetie?

13:47.659 --> 13:49.972
Sweetie, can you hear me?

13:49.972 --> 13:51.905
I'm in the elevator.
I'm losing you.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.085
- Alright.

14:00.085 --> 14:05.125
And five, four, three, two, one.

14:08.507 --> 14:11.476
Good job, Mama.
You're doing so good.

14:11.476 --> 14:14.617
Hold on. I'm gonna do
the episiotomy now.

14:14.617 --> 14:16.584
What? No, no, please.

14:16.584 --> 14:19.001
I didn't even get
a chance to try.

14:19.001 --> 14:21.037
Please don't cut me.
Please don't cut me.

14:21.037 --> 14:22.590
Her heart rate's stable.

14:22.590 --> 14:25.248
Maybe we can give Mom
a chance to do it on her own.

14:25.248 --> 14:27.285
- Please.
- Alright, let's go.

14:29.183 --> 14:31.013
- Alright.
- Okay.

14:31.013 --> 14:33.256
Just think of it
like taking a big shit.

14:34.671 --> 14:40.298
Ready? And five, four,
three two, one.

14:58.937 --> 15:01.077
Well, what did she eat?

15:03.735 --> 15:07.635
Okay.
Um, let me talk to her.

15:11.743 --> 15:15.333
Well, put her on 'cause
I'm gonna be on the floor

15:15.333 --> 15:17.576
for the next couple of hours
and I want to say good night.

15:20.752 --> 15:23.617
Pauline? Pauline?

15:23.617 --> 15:25.308
Pauline, you're cutting--

15:25.308 --> 15:27.276
Hey. Caroline's trying to feed.
She's asking for you.

15:27.276 --> 15:29.312
One minute.
Pauline, I'm sorry.

15:29.312 --> 15:31.349
I got to go.

15:31.349 --> 15:34.455
Thank you. You're a saint.

16:30.684 --> 16:34.377
Pauline? Lila?

16:36.448 --> 16:39.313
Pauline? Lila?

17:15.694 --> 17:17.558
Pathology.

17:47.623 --> 17:52.145
It's coded for the OCME.

17:52.145 --> 17:54.526
- She's an organ donor?
- Yeah.

17:54.526 --> 17:57.150
The sheet's there on top.

17:57.150 --> 17:59.635
Maybe she can help
another kid out there.

17:59.635 --> 18:03.156
She can't. She died
of bacterial meningitis.

18:03.156 --> 18:06.642
That's why she's coded
for the OCME.

18:06.642 --> 18:11.371
I wonder if brain death
preceded organ failure.

18:11.371 --> 18:14.719
I really wouldn't know.

18:14.719 --> 18:16.755
You can leave now.

18:37.604 --> 18:39.468
You'll need to take this
twice a day

18:39.468 --> 18:40.952
for the next two days.

18:40.952 --> 18:43.368
- What is it?
- It's antibiotics.

18:43.368 --> 18:46.268
If you've contracted anything
from being with her today,

18:46.268 --> 18:48.856
this will take care of it 100%.

18:48.856 --> 18:51.273
It's important
you both take this.

18:51.273 --> 18:53.861
I know this is a lot.

18:53.861 --> 18:56.278
Can you make sure
she got everything I said?

19:02.560 --> 19:05.701
<i>- Mija--</i>
- I heard her.

19:05.701 --> 19:08.531
You want me to call someone?

19:08.531 --> 19:10.775
You can go home now.

19:10.775 --> 19:12.294
I'm not leaving you.

19:12.294 --> 19:14.779
Get the fuck out of my face, Pauline.

19:29.656 --> 19:32.590
That's perfectly appropriate.
That's what's hot this season.

19:32.590 --> 19:34.626
What do you have
to say about the workplace?

19:34.626 --> 19:37.905
Bikini tops in the workplace?
Absolutely.

20:39.726 --> 20:41.521
- Hey!

20:41.521 --> 20:44.006
You're not allowed in here.

20:44.006 --> 20:45.663
I'm sorry.

20:45.663 --> 20:47.009
If you have a records request,

20:47.009 --> 20:48.838
you need to file it
through admin.

20:48.838 --> 20:52.532
I need to see my daughter.

20:52.532 --> 20:54.361
Meningitis?

20:54.361 --> 20:57.985
Lila Morales. Is she there?

20:57.985 --> 21:01.437
She was sent to the medical
examiner an hour ago.

21:01.437 --> 21:03.819
Would you like their number?

21:03.819 --> 21:09.376
Hmm.

21:09.376 --> 21:11.551
You can try them, but they're
usually closed on weekends.

21:14.692 --> 21:16.556
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

21:18.972 --> 21:21.388
No.

21:41.960 --> 21:46.724
Hey.

21:46.724 --> 21:48.898
Can I join you?

21:57.390 --> 21:59.702
Any other cases in the daycare?

21:59.702 --> 22:02.636
No, not that I heard.

22:04.397 --> 22:07.400
My phone died.

22:07.400 --> 22:11.714
I could have used the hospital
phone to check in, but...

22:11.714 --> 22:14.821
I don't know.
Maybe I liked it.

22:14.821 --> 22:16.754
Like a little vacation.

22:16.754 --> 22:19.135
This is not your fault.

22:21.206 --> 22:25.763
She was gone before I got here.

22:25.763 --> 22:27.834
I didn't get to see her.

22:31.803 --> 22:34.081
Let me take you home.

23:04.871 --> 23:07.563
Celie.

23:07.563 --> 23:10.566
We're here.

23:10.566 --> 23:11.981
<i>You've reached the office</i>

23:11.981 --> 23:14.467
<i>of the
Bronx County Medical Examiner.</i>

23:14.467 --> 23:16.883
<i>Our office is currently closed.</i>

23:16.883 --> 23:18.678
<i>If you'd like to leave
a message, please--</i>

23:32.795 --> 23:35.246
<i>It's me. We're in the ICU.</i>

23:39.250 --> 23:42.184
<i>Sweetie, we're in a taxicab
heading to the hosp--</i>

23:44.462 --> 23:46.015
<i>Hey, I'm so sorry
to bother you,</i>

23:46.015 --> 23:49.156
<i>but Lila's getting sicker.
I'm not sure--</i>

23:52.228 --> 23:56.785
<i>Hey, Mami, your baby's here,
and she wanted to talk to you.</i>

23:56.785 --> 23:58.200
<i>Come here.</i>

23:58.200 --> 24:00.202
<i>Say hi to Mommy's machine.</i>

24:02.791 --> 24:05.207
<i>- Mommy.
- She's not there.</i>

24:05.207 --> 24:08.037
<i>Leave a message.
- I slept a lot,</i>

24:08.037 --> 24:10.143
<i>and I had a dream
about a swamp.</i>

24:12.835 --> 24:15.804
<i>What else?</i>

24:28.920 --> 24:31.889
Your daughter's name?

24:31.889 --> 24:33.856
Lila Morales.

24:36.549 --> 24:39.759
Date of birth?

24:39.759 --> 24:42.762
August 9, 2015.

24:45.799 --> 24:48.043
Are you the sole
custodial parent?

24:50.701 --> 24:52.703
I'm sorry?

24:52.703 --> 24:54.877
Your daughter's father--
is he...?

24:54.877 --> 24:56.914
I had IVF. It's just us.

25:02.609 --> 25:04.853
Okay, that's it.

25:04.853 --> 25:06.820
Um, it'll take a minute.

25:06.820 --> 25:09.064
It's just loading.

25:22.940 --> 25:26.357
- What is it?

25:26.357 --> 25:30.016
This is saying...

25:30.016 --> 25:32.328
she's not here.

25:32.328 --> 25:34.572
- Excuse me?
- Hang on a minute.

25:42.097 --> 25:44.962
Do you remember a little girl
who passed away last Friday?

25:44.962 --> 25:46.204
You spoke with the mother.

25:46.204 --> 25:47.654
What's the issue?

25:47.654 --> 25:49.138
They say they don't have her.

25:49.138 --> 25:53.004
- Yeah. Not great.

25:53.004 --> 25:55.662
And I'm trying to figure out
what to tell the mother.

25:55.662 --> 25:57.215
She's in my office.

25:57.215 --> 26:00.184
Trying to come up with something
more comforting than,

26:00.184 --> 26:04.050
"The city of New York has
temporarily lost your daughter."

26:04.050 --> 26:08.123
Uh, well, you can tell her
their record keeping is a mess.

26:08.123 --> 26:10.815
Last year, they accidentally
cremated that Polish woman.

26:13.093 --> 26:15.786
Thanks. I got it.

26:20.963 --> 26:24.242
Ms. Morales, I promise you
we're doing everything we can.

26:24.242 --> 26:27.245
No, no, I am not leaving here
until I talk to somebody

26:27.245 --> 26:29.903
who can tell me
where my fucking daughter is!

26:29.903 --> 26:32.216
I cannot imagine
how upsetting this must be.

26:32.216 --> 26:35.012
- I want to talk to that woman.
- I'm sorry? Which woman?

26:35.012 --> 26:36.669
The one who saw Lila.

26:36.669 --> 26:38.740
Dr. Casper.
Well, I'm happy--

26:38.740 --> 26:41.328
I want to talk to her now!

26:45.022 --> 26:47.990
I'm sorry.
She was just in here.

26:53.237 --> 26:56.861
Hey!

26:56.861 --> 26:58.794
Hey, hold on a minute!

26:58.794 --> 27:01.003
Hey!

27:01.003 --> 27:03.281
Hold on a minute.
I want to talk to you.

27:07.389 --> 27:09.184
Hold on.

27:09.184 --> 27:10.806
It'll only take a second.
Please?

28:19.047 --> 28:22.222
Dr. Casper?
- Who are you?

28:22.222 --> 28:25.329
You don't know?

28:25.329 --> 28:27.434
You ran away from me
the other day.

28:30.403 --> 28:33.371
There's a complete chain
of custody for the entire time

28:33.371 --> 28:35.028
your daughter was
in the hospital's care.

28:35.028 --> 28:37.997
Look, things got fucked up,
I'm not gonna sue.

28:37.997 --> 28:39.308
I don't want any trouble.

28:39.308 --> 28:43.105
I just need to know
what happened.

28:43.105 --> 28:46.108
I ca-- I can't.

28:46.108 --> 28:48.835
- Can't what?
- I-- I can't help you.

28:52.839 --> 28:55.808
I need to get inside.
- I'd like to come in.

28:55.808 --> 28:57.223
I don't think
that's appropriate.

28:57.223 --> 28:58.569
Excuse me, please.
- What's in there?

28:58.569 --> 29:01.089
Will you let me into my house?!

29:01.089 --> 29:03.022
Okay. Okay.

29:08.199 --> 29:11.202
Ow!

29:27.115 --> 29:29.324
I can explain.

29:31.326 --> 29:33.017
And if you'll just--

29:33.017 --> 29:35.123
Don't you fucking touch her!

29:35.123 --> 29:37.297
I have to examine her,
or she'll die.

29:40.404 --> 29:42.958
She's alive.

29:53.589 --> 29:58.077
This cannula's been kinking
every time she shifts.

30:01.874 --> 30:04.152
She's alive?

30:04.152 --> 30:06.223
Yes. I told you that.

30:08.984 --> 30:13.092
But... how is this possible?

30:14.990 --> 30:17.130
Your daughter's genetic profile

30:17.130 --> 30:18.891
made her a perfect candidate

30:18.891 --> 30:21.617
for an experimental treatment
I've been working on.

30:21.617 --> 30:23.999
For meningitis?

30:23.999 --> 30:26.001
For death.

30:30.626 --> 30:32.214
What was that?

30:32.214 --> 30:35.079
That's Muriel.

30:35.079 --> 30:37.081
She died two months ago.

30:53.408 --> 30:56.411
Is that what you're feeding
Lila?

30:56.411 --> 30:59.000
This serum was derived
from fetal pigs,

30:59.000 --> 31:01.105
but the-- the principles
are the same.

31:01.105 --> 31:05.178
It triggers cell regeneration.

31:05.178 --> 31:10.632
Well, what about brain
and personality?

31:10.632 --> 31:12.323
I didn't know her
before she died.

31:12.323 --> 31:15.395
And she's a pig.

31:15.395 --> 31:17.156
I'm talking about Lila.

31:20.918 --> 31:24.577
Her primitive cranial nerve
reflexes are intact.

31:24.577 --> 31:28.132
So she could wake up.

31:28.132 --> 31:30.065
Theoretically, yes.

31:30.065 --> 31:32.481
But there are
ethical considerations.

31:32.481 --> 31:34.932
If Muriel had woken up
in pain or distress,

31:34.932 --> 31:37.003
I would have put her down.

31:37.003 --> 31:39.143
But she didn't.

31:39.143 --> 31:41.214
No.

31:44.148 --> 31:46.357
Ms. Morales,

31:46.357 --> 31:48.566
this experiment
is bigger than your daughter--

31:48.566 --> 31:51.052
or you or me.

31:51.052 --> 31:52.743
Y-You made her an organ donor,

31:52.743 --> 31:54.572
which I really admire.

31:54.572 --> 31:57.368
My daughter
is not an experiment.

32:09.311 --> 32:11.969
This line--
how long has it been kinking?

32:11.969 --> 32:13.488
Uh, every time she shifts.

32:13.488 --> 32:15.352
Well, it's too short.

32:15.352 --> 32:17.285
It needs an extension.

32:17.285 --> 32:19.080
How often do you turn her?

32:19.080 --> 32:20.495
Every few hours when I'm here.

32:20.495 --> 32:22.255
I-I'm not able to be here
all the time.

32:22.255 --> 32:25.396
She can't be left alone ever.

32:28.641 --> 32:31.126
Do you have a pull-out?

32:31.126 --> 32:33.542
I have a futon.

33:26.388 --> 33:29.391
Looking good for 10 weeks.

33:29.391 --> 33:31.152
Strong heartbeat.

33:31.152 --> 33:34.465
Everything's where it should be.

33:34.465 --> 33:36.674
Mom's in great shape, too,
for her age.

33:36.674 --> 33:39.125
What's your secret?

33:39.125 --> 33:40.678
Is that the placenta?

33:40.678 --> 33:42.749
That is. Good eye.

33:45.580 --> 33:47.616
Would you like a printout?

33:47.616 --> 33:50.378
No.

33:50.378 --> 33:52.276
How are you feeling?

33:52.276 --> 33:54.416
Are you experiencing
any discomfort?

33:54.416 --> 33:57.247
Nausea, some vomiting.
Nothing unusual.

33:57.247 --> 33:59.835
You've been pregnant before?

33:59.835 --> 34:01.354
Yes.

34:01.354 --> 34:04.530
Are we done?
- Uh, yeah, we're all set.

34:04.530 --> 34:05.876
You can get changed,

34:05.876 --> 34:09.086
and the doctor will be
right with you.

34:09.086 --> 34:11.261
Oh, I'll just give you
some privacy.

34:26.655 --> 34:29.555
I'm home!

34:36.113 --> 34:38.529
She was smiling today.

34:38.529 --> 34:40.497
It's a primitive reflex.

34:40.497 --> 34:42.602
I know, but it's a good sign.

34:48.505 --> 34:50.507
How was work?

34:50.507 --> 34:53.613
I found an undigested spoon
inside a man's stomach.

34:57.859 --> 34:59.723
Come here.

34:59.723 --> 35:04.831
Come on. Sit.

35:04.831 --> 35:07.938
Oh, yes! Good.

35:07.938 --> 35:10.389
How long have you been
doing that?

35:10.389 --> 35:12.943
A few days.
She's a fast learner.

35:12.943 --> 35:14.634
I saw this video online.

35:14.634 --> 35:17.603
It said only the smartest
little piggies could do it.

35:18.949 --> 35:21.848
How many of those
have you given her total?

35:21.848 --> 35:24.403
Uhh... a few handfuls?

35:24.403 --> 35:27.233
A handful isn't a unit
of measurement.

35:27.233 --> 35:28.648
She's on a specific diet.

35:28.648 --> 35:31.548
If you alter it in any way,
I need to know.

35:31.548 --> 35:33.412
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

35:33.412 --> 35:35.483
Just... record it.

35:40.591 --> 35:42.731
Are you working out there?

35:42.731 --> 35:46.459
I was planning to.

35:46.459 --> 35:49.566
Well, she's been gassy,

35:49.566 --> 35:52.741
so you'll have to turn her
over a few times.

35:57.021 --> 35:59.438
I'll be back after 8:00
with everything on the list.

35:59.438 --> 36:01.681
There's salad in the fridge.

37:36.500 --> 37:38.675
Sit.

- Okay.

39:10.801 --> 39:13.459
Sounds good, Doctor.

39:13.459 --> 39:15.012
- Celie.
- Hey.

39:15.012 --> 39:17.636
I-I didn't know you were back.

39:17.636 --> 39:19.948
Yeah. I'm just heading out now.

39:19.948 --> 39:21.916
You working overnights?

39:21.916 --> 39:26.438
Bouncing around.
Mostly prenatal admin stuff.

39:26.438 --> 39:29.061
Did you get my calls?

39:29.061 --> 39:30.787
- I'm sorry.
- No.

39:30.787 --> 39:32.892
I-I just wanted to make
sure you have people around.

39:32.892 --> 39:35.999
I'm doing okay.

39:35.999 --> 39:38.898
I didn't hear anything
about a service.

39:38.898 --> 39:40.175
There wasn't a service.

39:40.175 --> 39:42.039
But you'll have one.

39:42.039 --> 39:43.903
We're not religious.

39:43.903 --> 39:47.148
Oh. Okay.

39:47.148 --> 39:49.806
It's really nice to see you.
Take care.

39:54.742 --> 39:56.778
Hello?

39:56.778 --> 39:58.021
I'm home!

40:01.645 --> 40:03.923
Hello?!

40:03.923 --> 40:06.098
I'm home!

40:13.243 --> 40:15.452
Did you get everything?

40:15.452 --> 40:17.937
Yes.

40:17.937 --> 40:19.905
Are you okay?

40:19.905 --> 40:22.977
I'm fine.

40:45.482 --> 40:47.760
ECMO port capped.

40:51.108 --> 40:53.559
Turning off ventilator.

40:53.559 --> 40:55.975
Okay, here we go.

41:11.163 --> 41:12.716
She's not breathing.

41:12.716 --> 41:15.098
Just wait.

41:27.697 --> 41:31.563
Oh!

41:54.206 --> 41:56.898
- What is this?
- I made soup.

41:56.898 --> 41:59.763
It smells like meat.

41:59.763 --> 42:01.316
Mine is chicken and rice.

42:01.316 --> 42:04.147
Yours is celery and nothing.

42:12.327 --> 42:13.777
This is a miracle.

42:13.777 --> 42:16.262
Please don't use that word.

42:16.262 --> 42:17.988
- Sorry?
- There's nothing supernatural

42:17.988 --> 42:19.334
or fantastical about it.

42:19.334 --> 42:21.647
This is good science
and hard work over time.

42:21.647 --> 42:22.855
I only meant that--

42:22.855 --> 42:25.099
I understand
the colloquialism.

42:27.757 --> 42:30.069
How long have you
been working on this?

42:33.694 --> 42:34.902
It's hard to say.

42:34.902 --> 42:38.975
I-- I suppose
since I was quite young.

42:38.975 --> 42:42.254
About 6, maybe 7?

42:42.254 --> 42:43.807
Second grade?

42:43.807 --> 42:46.638
My mother.
She taught biology.

42:50.296 --> 42:53.299
She would take me
on nature trips.

42:53.299 --> 42:56.268
Discovery expeditions.

42:56.268 --> 42:58.995
When I was 6,
we went to Orchard Beach

42:58.995 --> 43:01.998
and we found a starfish.

43:01.998 --> 43:03.862
Apparently I was
very taken with it,

43:03.862 --> 43:05.933
so we brought it back home.

43:05.933 --> 43:08.832
She laid it out
on butcher paper,

43:08.832 --> 43:13.009
and she told me
to cut off its arm.

43:13.009 --> 43:15.701
I-I spent the whole year
measuring the arm every day.

43:15.701 --> 43:18.014
I'd think my eyes
were playing tricks on me,

43:18.014 --> 43:22.018
but the data showed
that this creature

43:22.018 --> 43:24.986
was fixing itself.

43:24.986 --> 43:28.058
Regenerating.

43:28.058 --> 43:30.716
Later at school,
I tried to amputate

43:30.716 --> 43:31.924
the leg of the class hamster.

43:31.924 --> 43:34.202
- It wasn't funny.

43:34.202 --> 43:35.756
No, no, I know.

43:35.756 --> 43:37.240
The animal squealed,
then bled out.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.656
It was awful.

43:42.245 --> 43:45.420
Where is she now? Your mom?

43:48.320 --> 43:50.425
She died.

43:50.425 --> 43:53.325
Of Parkinson's.

43:53.325 --> 43:56.121
I'm sorry.

43:57.467 --> 44:00.090
Thank you for the broth.

44:02.127 --> 44:04.060
Good night.

44:31.018 --> 44:33.986
Hey.

44:33.986 --> 44:36.713
Your mommy forget to feed you?

44:36.713 --> 44:38.853
Come on.

44:38.853 --> 44:41.304
Let's see what we got
for you here.

44:47.966 --> 44:49.346
Hello?

44:51.176 --> 44:55.387
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

44:55.387 --> 44:57.251
That was oncology.

44:57.251 --> 44:59.356
Did you call up the biopsy
results from yesterday?

44:59.356 --> 45:01.531
Yes.

45:01.531 --> 45:03.913
Wait. No.

45:03.913 --> 45:06.225
I-I didn't.

45:16.442 --> 45:18.134
Are you okay?

45:18.134 --> 45:21.516
Why?

45:21.516 --> 45:24.209
You're smiling.

45:27.384 --> 45:28.869
I'll get it done.

45:28.869 --> 45:31.112
I just have to finish
with this oth--

45:44.160 --> 45:47.266
Rose?

45:47.266 --> 45:49.337
Rose.

46:05.388 --> 46:11.463
- ♪ This is deep and peaceful

46:11.463 --> 46:19.091

47:13.249 --> 47:14.560

right now.</i>

47:14.560 --> 47:17.563
<i>Leave a message.</i>

47:21.153 --> 47:22.879
This is Rose' phone.

47:22.879 --> 47:24.398
Who am I talking to?

47:24.398 --> 47:27.435
My name is Scott Ward.
I work with Rose.

47:27.435 --> 47:29.644
- Hello, Scott.
- Hi.

47:32.440 --> 47:34.304
Can I talk to Rose, please?

47:34.304 --> 47:35.927
Um, I don't know
how to say this.

47:35.927 --> 47:38.274
There was an incident.

47:38.274 --> 47:40.241
- What happened?
- I'm sorry.

47:40.241 --> 47:42.485
I just don't know
if I should divulge...

47:42.485 --> 47:44.107
We live together.

47:44.107 --> 47:45.488
Oh.

47:45.488 --> 47:48.008
Oh! Right.

47:48.008 --> 47:52.944
It seems like she's gonna be
fine, but Rose collapsed.

47:52.944 --> 47:54.428
She's upstairs in surgery.

47:54.428 --> 47:55.705
If you're coming down here,

47:55.705 --> 47:57.396
I can stay and meet you
at the--

47:57.396 --> 47:59.295
Baby.

48:21.420 --> 48:22.628
Rose?

48:24.320 --> 48:25.459
Hold on a minute.

48:25.459 --> 48:28.048
I'll be right back.

48:31.051 --> 48:32.569
Ms. Casper?

48:32.569 --> 48:33.708
"Doctor."

48:33.708 --> 48:36.953
- Yes.
-"Dr. Casper."

48:36.953 --> 48:38.610
I'm sorry. Dr. Casper.

48:38.610 --> 48:41.578
I'm Dr. Chan.

48:41.578 --> 48:44.064
How long have I been here?

48:44.064 --> 48:45.962
Rose, relax.

48:45.962 --> 48:47.619
An infection developed
in your cervix,

48:47.619 --> 48:50.139
which spread throughout
your reproductive system.

48:50.139 --> 48:52.969
Will I be able to conceive?

48:56.662 --> 48:59.251
Can I still conceive?

49:02.254 --> 49:05.119
Show me my chart.

49:34.804 --> 49:36.668
Where were you?

49:36.668 --> 49:39.015
I was scared shitless.

49:41.259 --> 49:44.469
Rose.

49:44.469 --> 49:46.264
This batch is ruined.

49:46.264 --> 49:49.819
It needed to be centrifuged
12 hours ago.

49:49.819 --> 49:52.442
Where are your clothes?

49:56.757 --> 49:58.552
You woke her up?

49:58.552 --> 50:01.106
She woke up on her own.

50:10.391 --> 50:12.773
Mommy. Mommy.

50:16.466 --> 50:18.434
She shouldn't be awake.

50:21.057 --> 50:23.232
- Rose!

50:30.135 --> 50:32.448
Okay.

50:32.448 --> 50:34.415
Alright.

50:36.728 --> 50:39.869
You're lucky
you only popped three.

50:39.869 --> 50:42.251
You need to stay off your feet
for a few days.

50:42.251 --> 50:43.666
I'll be fine.

50:46.496 --> 50:48.878
Her behavior today.

50:48.878 --> 50:50.121
What did you observe?

50:50.121 --> 50:53.193
Uh, hand movement.

50:53.193 --> 50:54.884
Some eye movement.

50:54.884 --> 50:58.094
She was making sounds.
- Speech?

50:58.094 --> 51:02.581
Mm, not really, just... sounds.

51:02.581 --> 51:05.446
Did she seem to recognize you?

51:05.446 --> 51:07.483
I don't know.

51:07.483 --> 51:09.623
She's regenerating faster
than I expected,

51:09.623 --> 51:11.142
faster than Muriel.

51:11.142 --> 51:13.523
You make that sound
like a bad thing.

51:13.523 --> 51:16.630
We only have enough serum
for a few weeks.

51:16.630 --> 51:18.666
So we'll make more.

51:21.600 --> 51:27.330
You know the serum
comes from fetal tissue, yes?

51:27.330 --> 51:28.883
Yes.

51:28.883 --> 51:33.336
And you know where I get
that fetal tissue?

51:33.336 --> 51:37.513
I think so, yes.

51:37.513 --> 51:41.689
I can't make any more.

51:41.689 --> 51:44.934
Then what?

51:44.934 --> 51:47.488
I don't know yet.

51:47.488 --> 51:49.904
I'll figure something out.

52:06.990 --> 52:08.785
Did you sleep?

52:08.785 --> 52:10.511
Briefly.

52:12.893 --> 52:14.791
Is she due for a fresh bag?

52:14.791 --> 52:17.587
She doesn't need another
transfusion until Saturday.

52:17.587 --> 52:19.762
It <i>is</i> Saturday.

52:21.936 --> 52:23.697
Thank you. Would you...

52:33.327 --> 52:35.536
Can I get you some--
- No.

52:39.644 --> 52:41.887
Ah.

52:41.887 --> 52:46.444
You know, if you let me in,
I might be able to help.

52:46.444 --> 52:48.618
Any time I spend explaining
what I'm doing to you

52:48.618 --> 52:50.310
is time I spend not doing it.

52:50.310 --> 52:52.208
Well, if you'd explained things
to me before,

52:52.208 --> 52:55.349
we might not be
in this situation right now.

52:55.349 --> 52:57.731
What do you want to know?

52:57.731 --> 52:59.836
Well, you need
perinatal tissue, right?

52:59.836 --> 53:01.666
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, what about me?

53:01.666 --> 53:03.737
I mean, I'm her mother.
There's got to be something--

53:03.737 --> 53:05.256
You're not the right
blood type.

53:05.256 --> 53:08.017
Anything from your body
would kill her.

53:08.017 --> 53:09.950
Well, what about placenta
or cord blood?

53:09.950 --> 53:11.745
I can bring them home
from the hospital.

53:11.745 --> 53:13.747
And then what?
Hope for the best?

53:13.747 --> 53:15.783
Any donor would need
to match for blood type,

53:15.783 --> 53:17.578
as well as HLA markers.

53:17.578 --> 53:20.961
You don't understand how rare it
is that I matched with her.

53:20.961 --> 53:22.756
Well, what about
the organ donor registry?

53:22.756 --> 53:25.690
It's a box checked
on a driver's license.

53:25.690 --> 53:28.348
They don't run the full battery
of tests until postmortem,

53:28.348 --> 53:31.420
unless...

53:31.420 --> 53:35.251
What?

53:35.251 --> 53:37.771
Rose, what?!
- Uh...

53:37.771 --> 53:39.980
Watch her propofol drip
while I'm gone.

53:39.980 --> 53:41.430
Make sure she stays sedated.

53:41.430 --> 53:42.879
- Where are you going?
- Work!

53:42.879 --> 53:44.433

55:03.615 --> 55:05.583
Sorry.

55:05.583 --> 55:07.654
We need to talk.

55:09.483 --> 55:11.140
I crossed the OB intake records

55:11.140 --> 55:15.696
with the national bone marrow
registry, and I found a match.

55:15.696 --> 55:18.389
Emily Parker. O negative.

55:18.389 --> 55:20.736
HLA markers aren't perfect,
but I can work with them.

55:20.736 --> 55:22.427
She's only in her
second trimester,

55:22.427 --> 55:24.015
but we can use
her amniotic fluid.

55:24.015 --> 55:25.465
She had a triple test last week.

55:25.465 --> 55:26.880
I botched the results.

55:26.880 --> 55:29.089
She'll have to come in
for an amnio.

55:29.089 --> 55:30.642
That's awful.

55:30.642 --> 55:32.472
Her actual results are fine.

55:32.472 --> 55:34.439
Yeah, but this woman's gonna be
pulling her hair out all week

55:34.439 --> 55:35.785
thinking something's wrong
with her baby.

55:35.785 --> 55:37.856
Amniocentesis
is a simple procedure.

55:37.856 --> 55:40.721
The risks to mother
and fetus are negligible.

55:40.721 --> 55:42.965
Emily.

55:42.965 --> 55:44.173
What?

55:44.173 --> 55:47.625
The mother's name is Emily.

55:47.625 --> 55:49.454
Okay.

55:49.454 --> 55:51.939
If you have another plan,
I'd love to hear it.

56:16.895 --> 56:19.691
Yes?
- I'm heading out.

56:19.691 --> 56:21.969
She's still down,
but her mash is in the fridge.

56:21.969 --> 56:23.108
Do you have a monitor?

56:23.108 --> 56:24.938
- Yes.
- Okay.

56:24.938 --> 56:26.871
Like I said,
her mash is in the fridge.

56:26.871 --> 56:29.701
If there's anything you need me
to pick up, just call or text.

56:29.701 --> 56:31.185
I'm in the bathroom!

56:31.185 --> 56:32.877
Right. Sorry.

56:32.877 --> 56:35.051
I'll see you tonight.

56:55.071 --> 56:56.625
Good.

56:56.625 --> 56:57.798
And we're done.

56:57.798 --> 56:59.455
That's it, hon.
We're all done.

56:59.455 --> 57:00.836
Yeah, I know, Kev.

57:00.836 --> 57:02.216
So, uh, is there anything

57:02.216 --> 57:04.702
we need to do
or look out for short term?

57:04.702 --> 57:06.704
We'll know the results
in a few weeks.

57:06.704 --> 57:10.846
In the meantime, keep an eye out
for any cramping or spotting.

57:10.846 --> 57:13.987
And, uh, try not to worry
too much.

57:13.987 --> 57:16.265
There's no percentage
in worrying.

57:22.513 --> 57:23.893
Why isn't that coming off?
Is that normal?

57:23.893 --> 57:26.655
It's harmless.
It'll be gone in a few days.

57:26.655 --> 57:28.898
Yeah. It's the dye
from the disinfectant.

57:28.898 --> 57:30.175
It gets absorbed into the skin.

57:30.175 --> 57:33.282
- Where'd you read that?
- On Reddit.

57:33.282 --> 57:34.766
Hon, you know
there's a lot of stuff on there

57:34.766 --> 57:36.285
that's only gonna
make you upset.

57:36.285 --> 57:38.218
- What, like political stuff?
- You know what I mean.

57:38.218 --> 57:39.978
Those forums are
all horror stories.

57:39.978 --> 57:41.048
They make you hysterical.

57:41.048 --> 57:43.085
Hysterical?

57:43.085 --> 57:45.087
I'm-- I'm gonna step out
and get a seltzer.

57:45.087 --> 57:46.985
You want a seltzer, hon?
- Tea.

57:46.985 --> 57:48.987
- Lemon and sugar?
- Yeah.

57:51.645 --> 57:53.129
He means well.

57:53.129 --> 57:54.683
- Make a fist.

57:58.203 --> 57:59.791
Ready?
- Yeah.

57:59.791 --> 58:01.275
As long as you don't use
that big one.

58:03.899 --> 58:06.108
Is this your first?

58:06.108 --> 58:08.869
Um...

58:08.869 --> 58:12.114
We've been trying
for a really long time.

58:12.114 --> 58:15.082
But we've never gotten this far.

58:15.082 --> 58:17.050
How long you been trying?

58:17.050 --> 58:19.190
Three years.

58:19.190 --> 58:22.296
I know. We started late.

58:22.296 --> 58:25.541
I was older than you
when I had mine.

58:25.541 --> 58:27.301
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

58:27.301 --> 58:29.062
Got any pro tips,

58:29.062 --> 58:32.686
from one geriatric preggo
to another?

58:32.686 --> 58:34.343
Wherever you go,
whatever you do,

58:34.343 --> 58:37.139
have a direct route to the
nearest possible toilet.

58:37.139 --> 58:39.624
Construction site porta johns,

58:39.624 --> 58:42.558
diners and office buildings
with unlocked bathrooms,

58:42.558 --> 58:44.836
dumpsters that offer
some discretion.

58:44.836 --> 58:48.081
That sounds dignified.

58:48.081 --> 58:52.810
Dignity and motherhood
don't always line up.

58:52.810 --> 58:54.363
You got a boy or a girl?

58:54.363 --> 58:55.744
Girl.

58:55.744 --> 58:58.747
Little pressure.

58:58.747 --> 59:01.197
She's 6 years old.

59:01.197 --> 59:03.683
Her name is Lila.

59:03.683 --> 59:05.063
Lila.

59:05.063 --> 59:07.687
That's a gorgeous name.
- Mm-hmm.

59:07.687 --> 59:11.794
She turned out okay?

59:11.794 --> 59:15.142
She's perfect.

59:15.142 --> 59:17.110
Hey, hon,
I know you didn't want one,

59:17.110 --> 59:19.975
but I got one just in case.
- Aww, thanks.

How could you let her do this?

01:09:01.832 --> 01:09:04.283
Let her? What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:09:04.283 --> 01:09:05.353

doing-- this isn't science!

But you're not
that kind of doctor, are you?

01:09:39.732 --> 01:09:42.597
If I didn't show up,
what would you have done to her?

01:09:42.597 --> 01:09:45.876
Cut her open and have her
jumping on the fucking bed?

01:09:45.876 --> 01:09:47.740
Yeah, I saw your tapes.

01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:50.743
You did that to your own mother.

01:09:50.743 --> 01:09:54.747

01:09:54.747 --> 01:09:56.024

When Muriel missed her serum,

01:16:11.744 --> 01:16:13.401
her organs were
still regenerating,

01:16:13.401 --> 01:16:15.127
but her spinal nerves
were shredded.

01:16:15.127 --> 01:16:17.267
Her brain couldn't communicate
with the rest of her.

01:16:17.267 --> 01:16:19.200
That's what's happening
with Lila.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.822
If I could do it over,
I would double the amount

01:16:20.822 --> 01:16:22.203
of serum
perfusing her nervous system.

01:16:22.203 --> 01:16:24.895
But if we have enough
matching material,

01:16:24.895 --> 01:16:28.278
it might compensate
for the lack of serum.

01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:59.558
due to a deficit
of matching perinatal material.

01:20:10.534 --> 01:20:14.366
Attempts to isolate stem cells
from available tissue samples

01:20:14.366 --> 01:20:17.334
have proven unsuccessful.

01:20:42.118 --> 01:20:44.223
This has been a test
of motor coordination,

01:20:44.223 --> 01:20:47.364
ambulatory ability,
seventh attempt.

01:20:50.885 --> 01:20:53.646
It's not working.

01:20:53.646 --> 01:20:56.546
We would have seen
some improvement by now.

01:21:01.413 --> 01:21:03.242
Alright.
I can take more shifts.

01:21:03.242 --> 01:21:05.072
If it's a busy week,
I should be able

01:21:05.072 --> 01:21:06.659
to bring home more materials.
- Celie--

01:21:06.659 --> 01:21:08.558
You'll go back to looking
at the bone marrow registry

01:21:08.558 --> 01:21:11.043
and the intake records.
I can moonlight across town.

01:21:11.043 --> 01:21:15.392
- Celie.
- What?

01:21:15.392 --> 01:21:18.050
Don't take any more shifts.

01:21:18.050 --> 01:21:20.466
Call in.

01:21:20.466 --> 01:21:23.987
You're gonna want
to spend time with her now.

01:21:38.001 --> 01:21:40.107
Rose?

01:21:42.109 --> 01:21:44.387
Rose.

01:21:44.387 --> 01:21:48.563
Dr. Casper.

01:21:48.563 --> 01:21:50.496
Could I have a word?

01:21:58.746 --> 01:22:01.576
Did you sign this report?

01:22:05.753 --> 01:22:09.757
- Yes.
- Read it back to me.

01:22:09.757 --> 01:22:13.174
Pap tests shows
possible precancerous cells.

01:22:13.174 --> 01:22:15.073
I advised a biopsy.

01:22:15.073 --> 01:22:17.696
- Of the patient's cervix.
- Yes.

01:22:17.696 --> 01:22:21.631
<i>This</i> patient--
Francis Iamelli?

01:22:21.631 --> 01:22:23.322
Yes.

01:22:23.322 --> 01:22:26.774
Francis Iamelli has a penis.

01:22:26.774 --> 01:22:28.741
Yeah.

01:22:28.741 --> 01:22:30.743
He just had a weird morning.

01:22:30.743 --> 01:22:33.746
I must have attached
the wrong report.

01:22:33.746 --> 01:22:36.991
I have been...

01:22:36.991 --> 01:22:40.374
dealing with some...
personal issues.

01:22:42.238 --> 01:22:44.481
- Would you care to elaborate?
- No.

01:22:46.138 --> 01:22:48.175
Look, Rose.

01:22:48.175 --> 01:22:50.522
I know
what you're going through.

01:22:50.522 --> 01:22:54.146
When I was younger than you,
I lost three pregnancies.

01:22:54.146 --> 01:22:59.324
On the fourth one, the doctor
told me to stop trying.

01:22:59.324 --> 01:23:01.015
This thing that I always thought

01:23:01.015 --> 01:23:03.535
was gonna be
the cornerstone of my life--

01:23:03.535 --> 01:23:06.572
I was told
it wasn't gonna happen.

01:23:06.572 --> 01:23:09.127
I felt like my body betrayed me,

01:23:09.127 --> 01:23:11.784
like I had done everything right
and it didn't matter.

01:23:14.304 --> 01:23:17.756
What did you do?

01:23:17.756 --> 01:23:21.760
It took time to process,
but I bounced back.

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.624
I was young.

01:23:23.624 --> 01:23:25.626
You're young.

01:23:25.626 --> 01:23:28.560
As you get older,
you realize the point of life.

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:31.839
It isn't just one thing.

01:23:31.839 --> 01:23:34.462
What is the point?

01:23:34.462 --> 01:23:36.223
Of life?

01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:43.161
I think purpose
is a moving target.

01:23:43.161 --> 01:23:45.853
But I find joy
in lots of things.

01:23:45.853 --> 01:23:49.650
In music. Montauk.

01:23:49.650 --> 01:23:52.653
My nieces and nephews.

01:23:52.653 --> 01:23:55.414
I read.

01:23:55.414 --> 01:23:57.796
And that's enough for you?

01:24:01.179 --> 01:24:03.181
Get your shit together, Rose.

01:24:03.181 --> 01:24:05.804
I'm not having
this conversation again.

01:24:23.235 --> 01:24:26.445
It's okay.

01:24:34.419 --> 01:24:36.731
It's okay. I'm here.

01:24:40.597 --> 01:24:43.221
Mommy's here.

01:25:03.206 --> 01:25:05.726
Everything's gonna be alright.

01:25:05.726 --> 01:25:09.212
I promise.

01:25:21.604 --> 01:25:23.744
Celie?

01:26:09.997 --> 01:26:12.482
One second!

01:26:17.936 --> 01:26:20.249
Hello?
- Hi.

01:26:20.249 --> 01:26:22.768
It's Celie.
I was your OB nurse.

01:26:22.768 --> 01:26:24.460
Yeah. Hi. Hello.

01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:27.808
I'm so sorry to bother you.
Can I come in?

01:26:27.808 --> 01:26:30.397
Yeah, of-- of course.
Come on in.

01:26:30.397 --> 01:26:32.640
Thank you.

01:26:35.781 --> 01:26:38.267
You have a beautiful home.

01:26:38.267 --> 01:26:39.785
Oh, thanks so much.

01:26:39.785 --> 01:26:43.444
Yeah, we have a lot
more room out here.

01:26:43.444 --> 01:26:45.343
Is everything okay
with my pregnancy?

01:26:45.343 --> 01:26:49.278
Oh. Yes. Yes.
Everything's perfectly fine.

01:26:49.278 --> 01:26:51.280
- Jesus.
- Sorry.

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:53.730
I-- I probably should have
led with that.

01:26:53.730 --> 01:26:56.975
No, um, we've had complaints
from patients

01:26:56.975 --> 01:26:59.011
transferring
about not getting their records,

01:26:59.011 --> 01:27:01.773
so I just wanted to make sure
you got a copy.

01:27:01.773 --> 01:27:04.465
I know you haven't had
the easiest time with us, so...

01:27:04.465 --> 01:27:06.053
Oh.

01:27:06.053 --> 01:27:08.538
I really appreciate you
coming all the way out here.

01:27:11.921 --> 01:27:15.511
You can get that.
- Oh... it's fine.

01:27:18.514 --> 01:27:21.862
Can I offer you something?
Like water or...?

01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:27.523
Tea would be nice.

01:27:27.523 --> 01:27:30.836
It's weird. It's like
any drunk 12-year-old can do it,

01:27:30.836 --> 01:27:33.632
but Kev and I are getting
our PhD in child rearing.

01:27:35.358 --> 01:27:39.604
All we have is Irish Breakfast
tea, decaffeinated.

01:27:39.604 --> 01:27:41.916
- I'm not choosy.
- Okay.

01:27:45.023 --> 01:27:47.784
Ohh.

01:27:47.784 --> 01:27:50.718
Are you alright?
- Yeah. Um...

01:27:50.718 --> 01:27:53.376
It's gas.
- Ah.

01:27:53.376 --> 01:27:54.481
No, no, no, no. It's awful.

01:27:54.481 --> 01:27:55.689
Please.
- Let me take over.

01:27:55.689 --> 01:27:56.966
You're gonna walk
right into it.

01:27:56.966 --> 01:27:59.451
I've walked into worse.

01:27:59.451 --> 01:28:01.522
So embarrassing.

01:28:01.522 --> 01:28:04.076
Man.

01:28:04.076 --> 01:28:06.562
Yeah, so, it hurts when I sit,

01:28:06.562 --> 01:28:10.462
and then it hurts
when I [chuckling] stand up.

01:28:10.462 --> 01:28:13.085
This little alien parasite

01:28:13.085 --> 01:28:16.572
is giving me a run
for my money, I swear.

01:28:16.572 --> 01:28:18.712
Lemon and sugar, yeah?

01:28:18.712 --> 01:28:20.541
Yeah.

01:28:20.541 --> 01:28:24.683
Right.

01:28:24.683 --> 01:28:27.652
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hot.

01:28:27.652 --> 01:28:31.621
It smells divine.

01:28:31.621 --> 01:28:33.692
Thank you.

01:28:36.385 --> 01:28:37.903
Alright, come on, come on,
come on.

01:28:37.903 --> 01:28:39.457
Come on. I got you.

01:28:39.457 --> 01:28:43.357
I got you. Stay with me.

01:28:43.357 --> 01:28:46.947
- EMS!

01:28:48.362 --> 01:28:51.779
She's right here.
37 years old.

01:28:51.779 --> 01:28:54.541
Seven months pregnant.
- Get the board.

01:28:54.541 --> 01:28:55.887
You make the call?
- Yeah.

01:28:55.887 --> 01:28:58.096
She started seizing
10 minutes ago.

01:28:58.096 --> 01:28:59.787
And she's going into labor.
- You're okay. You're okay.

01:28:59.787 --> 01:29:01.410
I'm her nurse
at Bronx Memorial.

01:29:01.410 --> 01:29:03.101
- What's her name?
- Emily.

01:29:03.101 --> 01:29:06.415
Emily, we're gonna take
good care of you, okay?

01:29:06.415 --> 01:29:07.933
You're lucky
your friend was here.

01:29:09.383 --> 01:29:11.005
- Okay.

01:29:11.005 --> 01:29:13.525
Let's turn her on my count.
One, two, three.

01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:19.151
Okay.

01:29:19.151 --> 01:29:21.671
- You with us?

01:29:21.671 --> 01:29:23.535
Nod if you're with me.

01:29:23.535 --> 01:29:26.952
Okay. Okay.

01:29:26.952 --> 01:29:30.059
This is gonna help you breathe.

01:29:52.046 --> 01:29:55.809
Mama, eyes on me. Eyes on me.

01:29:55.809 --> 01:29:57.811
Your baby's gonna be fine.
I promise you.

01:29:57.811 --> 01:29:59.916
What about me?

01:29:59.916 --> 01:30:01.780
What's that, Mama?

01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:03.782
What about me?

01:30:03.782 --> 01:30:06.164
Pressure. Come on. Let's go.

01:30:06.164 --> 01:30:08.511
Suction. I've got it.

01:30:21.869 --> 01:30:23.181
The baby's not breathing.

01:30:25.770 --> 01:30:27.772
Let me see.

01:30:29.187 --> 01:30:30.637
I need hands over here.

01:30:30.637 --> 01:30:32.604
- What's wrong?
- Just belows the ribs.

01:30:32.604 --> 01:30:34.917
We're dropping compression.
- Get that... suction.

01:30:34.917 --> 01:30:36.815
I can't see.

01:30:38.576 --> 01:30:40.509
She's seizing again.
Can I get some help here?

01:30:43.132 --> 01:30:46.031
It is 100 over 65.

01:31:34.045 --> 01:31:36.012
- Celie.
- Get to pathology.

01:31:36.012 --> 01:31:37.289
Celie, where are you?

01:31:37.289 --> 01:31:39.153
Get to pathology now.

01:32:23.612 --> 01:32:25.821
Did you get everything?

01:32:29.272 --> 01:32:31.309
Yes.

01:32:33.725 --> 01:32:37.108
I didn't mean to kill her.

01:32:37.108 --> 01:32:39.075
I just wanted to induce
so that we could--

01:32:39.075 --> 01:32:41.146
It doesn't matter.

01:32:43.217 --> 01:32:45.910
There was nothing else
I could do.

01:32:56.886 --> 01:33:00.200
Do you need to sleep?

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:02.271
I can't.

01:33:04.756 --> 01:33:07.069
Then let's get to work.

01:33:42.898 --> 01:33:44.278
Clear.

01:33:48.455 --> 01:33:51.769
Three, two, one. Clear.

01:33:55.462 --> 01:33:58.189
Okay. We're in V-fib.
Go again.

01:34:16.725 --> 01:34:18.761
