01:30.878 --> 01:33.088
You hear something?

01:33.255 --> 01:35.423
ARTHUR:
It's the doorbell.

01:36.384 --> 01:39.177
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hm.

01:39.845 --> 01:41.888
What time is it?

01:45.810 --> 01:48.269
Quarter to 6.

02:41.657 --> 02:44.659
- What is it?
- Someone left a box.

02:45.077 --> 02:46.161
Who?

02:46.328 --> 02:49.330
I don't know.
There was a car and they just drove off.

02:49.665 --> 02:52.083
BOY:
Did Santa come early this year?

02:57.131 --> 02:59.340
I guess we're up.

03:05.014 --> 03:07.265
ARTHUR: You never really believed
in Santa Claus, did you?

03:07.433 --> 03:09.476
WALTER: You should've come up
with a better story...

03:09.643 --> 03:11.311
...than a fat guy
coming down the chimney.

03:11.479 --> 03:13.271
- It's so illogical.
ARTHUR: And illegal.

03:13.439 --> 03:15.523
WALTER:
It's breaking and entering.

03:17.902 --> 03:19.861
ARTHUR:
What kind of car was it?

03:20.237 --> 03:23.865
Well, it was black.

03:24.492 --> 03:27.702
- Okay.
- Why would they just drive off?

03:28.621 --> 03:30.789
I don't know, sweetheart.

03:32.917 --> 03:34.417
Get the box.

03:37.046 --> 03:38.505
What is it?

03:41.217 --> 03:43.343
Never seen anything like it before
in my life.

03:43.511 --> 03:46.054
Well, you need a key to open it.

03:49.558 --> 03:51.184
There's a note.

03:52.645 --> 03:54.896
Looks like a wedding invitation.

03:55.898 --> 03:58.399
Is it some sort of bridesmaid gift
from the Powells?

NORMA: "Mr. Steward will call upon you
at 5 p.m."

04:04.657 --> 04:06.407

04:06.575 --> 04:09.244
I don't. Do you?

04:47.032 --> 04:49.659
- It's snowing.
- It won't stick.

04:49.827 --> 04:51.619
Hey. PB and J.

04:51.787 --> 04:54.622
- Did you cut the bread into squares?
- Of course, like always.

04:54.790 --> 04:57.041
Well, don't do that.
Squares are for babies.

04:57.209 --> 04:58.751
- Hey, Mrs. Lewis.
- Hi, Mrs. Lewis.

04:58.919 --> 04:59.961
NORMA:
Morning, boys.

05:00.337 --> 05:03.464
Feel free to call me Norma.
Mrs. Lewis makes me feel old.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.758
You are old.

05:06.385 --> 05:08.011
I'm only 35.

05:08.178 --> 05:10.054
WALTER:
Yeah, to us, that's old.

05:10.222 --> 05:11.848
You're kind of a geezer.

05:12.016 --> 05:14.976
NORMA: You'll be a geezer one day too,
Mr. Smarty-Pants.

05:16.645 --> 05:19.981
Why does the bus stop have to be
in the front of my driveway?

05:20.316 --> 05:23.985
So I can watch my little Walter
get on the bus safe, in one piece.

05:24.445 --> 05:26.404
WALTER: Please go inside,
you're embarrassing me.

05:26.572 --> 05:29.198
NORMA: My love embarrasses you?
WALTER: Yes, it does.

05:29.366 --> 05:32.243
What if I give my big strong Walter
a big hug and a kiss...

05:32.411 --> 05:34.245
...right before he gets on the bus?

MAN [ON RADIO]:
- Will not be a year of politics as usual.

06:02.691 --> 06:06.152
It can be a year of inspiration and hope.

06:06.320 --> 06:09.197
Little early for a midlife crisis,
don't you think?

06:09.365 --> 06:12.784
- And it will be a year of concern...
- So, who's Mr. Steward?

06:12.952 --> 06:16.537
...of quiet and sober reassessment...
- I have no idea.

06:17.039 --> 06:19.123
Is it someone from school?

06:19.375 --> 06:20.833
I don't know.

06:21.669 --> 06:23.378
Is it your secret lover?

06:24.588 --> 06:26.172
I hate you.

06:53.659 --> 06:56.577
A wish unfulfilled.

06:57.413 --> 06:59.706
This is Sartre's vision of hell.

07:00.290 --> 07:02.208
Hell is other people.

07:02.376 --> 07:08.631
Yes. Hell is other people
seeing you for who you truly are.

07:09.091 --> 07:11.592
So, what does this mean for Estelle?

07:11.760 --> 07:14.887
It means she's going to rot in hell.

07:15.055 --> 07:17.849
She's a slut who married for money
and killed her baby.

07:19.351 --> 07:23.354
It's slightly more complicated than that,
Charles.

07:24.023 --> 07:28.026
See, she was poor and married into money
to save her family.

...to determine the path
of carbon chemistry.

...to gain another perspective
in the cosmic history...

Yes, in the back. Rhonda.

09:42.411 --> 09:44.912
Yes. Can you elaborate on the soil tests?

09:46.248 --> 09:48.958

measures the production...

09:49.126 --> 09:52.920
...or uptake of C02, nitrogen...

09:53.088 --> 09:55.673
...methane, hydrogen and oxygen...

...during the incubation
of the Martian soil sample.

involved?

of the NSA is here in Langley.

Would you tell us about tests?

10:13.609 --> 10:16.611
WOMAN 2: Would an ancient Martian
civilization have left something behind?

10:16.778 --> 10:19.822
I have no comment,
but I thank you for the information, Rhonda.

10:19.990 --> 10:21.782
Any other questions?

10:22.951 --> 10:25.036
If we find water beneath the surface...

10:25.204 --> 10:28.873
...and the orbiter photos of Utopia Planitia
indicate there were once rivers...

10:29.041 --> 10:30.625
...on the surface of the planet...

10:30.792 --> 10:33.669

we'll eventually find evidence of life.

- Yep.
- Absolutely.

- Is that what you're gonna do?
- Absolutely.

- Terry, don't blow the place up.

Is that all right with you?

12:47.262 --> 12:50.389
It's sweet, I guess. Where's my present?

Hello. My name is Arlington Steward.

Yes.

Yes, we do.

Can I offer you anything?

I never have much of an appetite.

Yes, in a way.
I do have an offer to make.

A financial opportunity.

Let me explain.

15:13.658 --> 15:15.910
In this envelope, there is a key.

15:16.536 --> 15:18.245
I'll show you.

This key opens the glass dome
to the button unit.

Now, if you push the button,
two things will happen.

First, someone, somewhere in the world,
whom you don't know...

Well, who do you work for?

16:59.681 --> 17:04.476
Guarantee of payment
comes with three restrictions, I'm afraid.

17:04.853 --> 17:07.855
One, I am not permitted...

17:08.023 --> 17:12.526
...to disclose any information
about the identity of my employers.

...I shall return
and retrieve the button unit.

- You got it.

But I'm using
the new GE Silastic polymer...

WENDELL: Nice, pal.
- Thank you.

18:13.088 --> 18:15.923
Hey. What happened to her foot?

18:18.760 --> 18:23.472
When she was 17,
her brother dropped a barbell on her foot.

18:23.640 --> 18:27.059
She thinks one of her toes is broken,
so she goes to the hospital.

18:27.227 --> 18:30.020
The doctor sets her in a chair,
turns the x-ray machine on...

18:30.188 --> 18:32.731
...then goes to check on another
patient down the hall.

18:33.108 --> 18:35.401
And he forgets all about Norma.

18:35.568 --> 18:37.695
Leaves the x-ray machine running.

18:38.488 --> 18:39.863
Oh, Jesus, that's...

18:40.031 --> 18:42.658
- That's not good.
- No.

18:43.118 --> 18:46.704
The tissue in four of her toes
was completely destroyed by the radiation.

18:47.163 --> 18:48.956
They had to amputate four of her toes?

18:49.916 --> 18:53.001
Yep. Then they had to go in
and get skin from her inner thigh...

18:53.169 --> 18:54.837
...to cover the front of her foot.

18:55.004 --> 18:59.633

July 20, 1969...

56:43.562 --> 56:47.023

from the Moon telling us:

56:47.191 --> 56:50.235
"The Eagle has landed."

56:50.403 --> 56:54.489
Today's landing, like that one,
represents the realization of a dream...

56:54.657 --> 56:58.368
...that has long excited
mankind's imagination.

56:58.536 --> 57:03.373
And this mission offers the possibility
of a momentous discovery...

57:03.541 --> 57:05.917
...in the history of mankind:

57:06.085 --> 57:09.045
The existence of life
elsewhere in the universe.

57:10.673 --> 57:17.137
If the experiments ofVikings 1 and 2
do not reveal living organisms...

57:17.304 --> 57:19.764
...they will learn other secrets
of the universe.

57:19.932 --> 57:23.643
They will tell us a good many things
about our own planet...

57:23.811 --> 57:27.188
...opening up new possibilities
for exploration...

57:27.356 --> 57:31.526

that will improve the quality of life...

57:31.694 --> 57:33.695

Our achievements in space represent
not only the height of technological skill...

the capacity for creativity and sacrifice...

she lives in Richmond?

1:00:03.721 --> 1:00:07.473
Did your husband tell you
where he was going this morning?

1:00:08.809 --> 1:00:10.143
No, he didn't.

1:00:10.311 --> 1:00:13.938
I hope for your sake

Is Dana one of your employees?

As I've told you, I have many employees.

Yeah, I did.

This guy's wife, she was shot once
in the chest. Point-blank range.

Mr. Steward had come back from the dead

to a high-security military hospital.

1:20:35.952 --> 1:20:37.661
...why a box?

1:20:41.833 --> 1:20:43.959

You drive to work in it.
You drive home in it.

You sit in your home, staring into a box.

It erodes your soul...

...while the box that is your body
inevitably withers, then dies...

1:21:05.022 --> 1:21:10.527
