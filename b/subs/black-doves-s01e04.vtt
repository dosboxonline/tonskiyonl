[Sam] Helen, this is Williams.

25:23.875 --> 25:26.207
You met her already
when she tried to kill you.

25:26.208 --> 25:28.124
- Yeah, I remember.
- You remember I was winning?

25:28.125 --> 25:31.457
- I remember there were two of you.
- Yeah, initially.

25:31.458 --> 25:33.166
Eleanor, professional assassin.

25:35.125 --> 25:36.166
Has she woken up yet?

25:36.666 --> 25:39.916
No. She's on some fairly weighty opioids.

25:40.458 --> 25:43.957
Lucky her. So, there are people
looking for this girl?

25:43.958 --> 25:45.249
- [Sam] Yeah.
- Who?

25:45.250 --> 25:47.541
Whoever they are,
they're offering a lot of money for her.

25:48.041 --> 25:48.875
Well,

25:49.708 --> 25:50.541
Sam,

25:51.916 --> 25:54.915
Hector is out there, still on the run,

25:54.916 --> 25:56.749
and he needs to be found.

25:56.750 --> 26:00.749
Or we start having to talk about
your Michael in the past tense,

26:00.750 --> 26:04.125
which, hand on heart,
I do not wish to happen.

26:05.250 --> 26:07.458
- So get a bloody move on.
- [lock clacks]

26:12.208 --> 26:15.290
- You got Michael dragged into this? Fuck.
- No. It's fine. He's fine.

26:15.291 --> 26:17.749
He is and he isn't, really,
depending on how you look at it.

26:17.750 --> 26:19.040
- [Kai-Ming yells]
- Jesus!

26:19.041 --> 26:21.957
- [Eleanor] Jesus Christ!
- What the fuck? Who the fuck are you?

26:21.958 --> 26:24.707
- Okay, Kai-Ming.
- You bitch! I'll break your fucking skull!

26:24.708 --> 26:26.375
Okay. Now, listen, there's no--

26:27.250 --> 26:30.457
- [Helen] Jesus!
- Oi! That was my grandmother's lamp.

26:30.458 --> 26:31.707
Kai-Ming, we are friends.

26:31.708 --> 26:33.290
- We're here to help.
- I don't know you.

26:33.291 --> 26:35.624
We came and got you
from the people who were holding you.

26:35.625 --> 26:37.290
[Eleanor] Bit of bad news on that front.

26:37.291 --> 26:39.457
Gonna need new drug dealers.
We did shoot 'em all.

26:39.458 --> 26:40.791
- What?
- [Helen] Kai-Ming.

26:41.708 --> 26:44.165
- Do you know that your father is dead?
- Of course I know.

26:44.166 --> 26:46.332
[Helen] Do you know
three other people are dead too?

26:46.333 --> 26:48.457
Your friend Maggie and... and two other men.

26:48.458 --> 26:49.457
Yes.

26:49.458 --> 26:51.666
We're trying to find
the people who did that.

26:52.166 --> 26:55.666
Yeah, we need to know what happened
after your father was killed.

26:56.291 --> 26:57.165
I'm so sorry.

26:57.166 --> 26:59.665
You... you... you can trust us,
Kai-Ming, I promise.

26:59.666 --> 27:00.625
[Sam] Mm.

27:01.583 --> 27:03.375
Do you want to sit down? Yeah?

27:04.541 --> 27:05.375
Okay.

27:10.458 --> 27:13.415
I was out with my friends,
and I came home,

27:13.416 --> 27:15.790
and we found my dad in my flat.

27:15.791 --> 27:17.791
And we just... we all panicked.

27:18.458 --> 27:20.750
My boyfriend, Cole, ran away, and

27:22.083 --> 27:24.915
I wasn't thinking, you know, straight.

27:24.916 --> 27:27.291
And I had all this stuff on me, and,

27:28.375 --> 27:30.540
well, I panicked as well, I suppose.

27:30.541 --> 27:32.458
So I ran to...

27:33.666 --> 27:36.833
- There's this place I know.
- A warehouse in South London?

27:37.333 --> 27:40.249
- [Kai-Ming] Yeah, I score there sometimes.
- Mm. It's a morgue now.

27:40.250 --> 27:42.249
[suspenseful music plays]

27:42.250 --> 27:46.999
At what point did you stop being a, um...
a guest there and start being a hostage?

27:47.000 --> 27:50.791
When they found out who I was.
I tried to leave. They wouldn't let me.

27:51.666 --> 27:54.958
- They just kept asking me questions.
- [Helen] What kind of questions?

27:57.083 --> 27:58.541
They wanted to know about Trent.

27:59.625 --> 28:01.583
- Who's Trent?
- [Kai-Ming] Just a guy I know.

28:02.833 --> 28:06.207
He's kind of a dork,
but he always helps us get...

28:06.208 --> 28:07.165
Heroin?

28:07.166 --> 28:08.082
Yeah.

28:08.083 --> 28:09.666
[suspenseful music continues]

28:10.625 --> 28:13.833
I think his family have a connection,
but I... I don't know.

28:14.458 --> 28:16.290
Anyway, they wouldn't stop
asking about him.

28:16.291 --> 28:20.833
And what can you tell me about a man
called Jason Davies? Do you know anything?

28:21.916 --> 28:24.666
He... No. He... he left me a message.

28:25.916 --> 28:28.707
Just said he was Maggie's partner
and wanted me to call him.

28:28.708 --> 28:30.499
- Partner?
- [Kai-Ming] Yeah.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.583
Wha...

28:33.000 --> 28:35.999
Well, what... what did he mean by that?

28:36.000 --> 28:37.416
I don't know.

28:38.500 --> 28:39.666
I never called him back.

28:41.791 --> 28:44.958
[cries] I didn't want
any of this to happen.

28:45.750 --> 28:48.208
[Williams] Hey! Don't get upset.

28:48.791 --> 28:50.915
Do you want a... a glass of champagne?

28:50.916 --> 28:51.874
[sighs]

28:51.875 --> 28:54.291
[Williams] And a... chocolate cake?

28:57.375 --> 28:59.749
Yeah? She does.

28:59.750 --> 29:01.749
Is her boyfriend still alive,
do you think?

29:01.750 --> 29:03.666
His name's Cole Atwood. He's a spy.

29:04.458 --> 29:05.790
- [softly] No!
- Yeah.

29:05.791 --> 29:08.625
CIA agent. The Chinese think
he's the one that killed the ambassador.

29:09.583 --> 29:12.416
Reed wants me to go into
the American embassy and get him out.

29:13.166 --> 29:15.665
I mean, it might be quite good.
We could ask him some questions.

29:15.666 --> 29:19.415
Find out who the fuck this Trent is
and how Jason got mixed up in all of this.

29:19.416 --> 29:21.708
- That sounds incredibly risky.
- Yeah.

29:23.083 --> 29:23.916
Wanna come?

29:24.541 --> 29:25.999
[suspenseful music ends]

29:26.000 --> 29:27.666
[engine revs]

29:32.708 --> 29:34.666
There are different kinds of partners.

29:35.958 --> 29:36.832
Right.

29:36.833 --> 29:39.958
You know? Like you and me, we're partners.

29:40.541 --> 29:42.665
It doesn't mean
he wasn't who he said he was.

29:42.666 --> 29:44.875
God, I was so close to leaving with him.

29:45.916 --> 29:47.583
What if it was all bullshit, Sam?

29:49.958 --> 29:51.458
Did you ever tell him anything

29:52.583 --> 29:54.499
about... you?

29:54.500 --> 29:57.291
No. I didn't tell him anything.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.040
Were you desperate to leave with him,
or were you just desperate to leave?

30:07.041 --> 30:08.500
I don't know. I just...

30:10.291 --> 30:11.125
I guess...

30:14.458 --> 30:18.541
When I first started, I had a little book
that I'd, um, write my lies into.

30:19.291 --> 30:22.625
Then, once I'd memorized them,
I'd, uh, burn the pages, and that was it.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.375
They were real. [scoffs]

30:25.500 --> 30:27.249
I have secrets from you, you know?

30:27.250 --> 30:30.541
I have secrets from Wallace,
from the kids, from Reed.

30:31.458 --> 30:35.999
I wake up sometimes and I can't breathe.
I can't breathe, Sam, because...

30:36.000 --> 30:38.207
[melancholy music plays]

30:38.208 --> 30:39.750
...I have no idea who I am.

30:41.666 --> 30:43.666
And neither does anyone else. Not really.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.041
I don't know
why I wanted to leave with him.

30:50.458 --> 30:51.666
Maybe it was just a...

30:52.958 --> 30:55.291
a new page
that I could write another lie onto.

30:58.750 --> 31:00.082
But it felt like love.

31:00.083 --> 31:02.166
[melancholy music continues]

31:06.166 --> 31:07.000
Michael?

31:08.625 --> 31:09.708
I went to see him.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.083
Well, that was silly.

31:12.875 --> 31:13.875
Wasn't it just?

31:16.125 --> 31:17.375
What was it like?

31:19.791 --> 31:21.000
Well, it was

31:21.625 --> 31:23.790
good to have confirmation
that he hates me.

31:23.791 --> 31:25.750
It's worse not knowing, I suppose.

31:29.625 --> 31:32.833
I always wondered... if enough time passed...

31:35.083 --> 31:35.915
You know...

31:35.916 --> 31:38.333
[melancholy music continues]

31:41.500 --> 31:42.333
I'm sorry.

31:45.416 --> 31:46.250
[chuckles]

31:47.083 --> 31:48.000
Oh, love.

31:49.958 --> 31:51.291
We'll be all right, won't we?

31:55.666 --> 31:56.500
Probably.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.083
If I was to make a list

32:01.666 --> 32:04.040
of the hardest buildings
to get into in Europe,

32:04.041 --> 32:08.457
it's basically a tie
between this place and Berghain.

32:08.458 --> 32:10.665
- [Helen chuckles softly]
- [scribbling]

32:10.666 --> 32:14.415
I mean, I got into Berghain,
but, you know, the point still stands.

32:14.416 --> 32:15.333
[Helen] Mm-hmm.

32:15.833 --> 32:19.791
We're gonna need a pass,
probably some kind of disguise.

32:20.500 --> 32:23.540
Now, there are also utility elevators--

32:23.541 --> 32:26.208
No, I'm just gonna go
and see my friend Vanessa.

32:27.791 --> 32:28.624
Vanessa?

32:28.625 --> 32:32.790
Yeah, 45-year-old diplomatic secretary
from Delaware.

32:32.791 --> 32:35.749
I mean, quite possibly
the most boring woman I've ever met,

32:35.750 --> 32:38.915
and bear in mind, my social circle
is almost entirely made up

32:38.916 --> 32:41.624
of the upper echelons
of the Conservative Party membership.

32:41.625 --> 32:43.583
So what do I do while you're in there?

32:44.083 --> 32:46.499
Ring this number.
You ask for Vanessa Robinson.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.415
You say it's an emergency. I don't know.

32:48.416 --> 32:50.957
Keep her on the line long enough
that I can get to the top floor

32:50.958 --> 32:51.957
and get Cole Atwood.

32:51.958 --> 32:55.624
Remember when we first met and I was just
sat outside in a car waiting for you?

32:55.625 --> 32:57.291
Life really is an echo, isn't it?

32:58.708 --> 32:59.832
Ooh.

32:59.833 --> 33:00.749
Good luck.

33:00.750 --> 33:02.875
[suspenseful music plays]

33:12.000 --> 33:13.083
[machine beeps]

33:15.041 --> 33:17.165
[man] This way, ma'am. Items in the tray.

33:17.166 --> 33:19.250
[suspenseful music continues]

33:23.250 --> 33:24.125
[machine beeps]

33:36.333 --> 33:38.165
She's just there. Thank you.

33:38.166 --> 33:40.208
- Hi.
- [Vanessa] Hi. [chuckles]

33:40.958 --> 33:43.832
Oh my goodness.
I am so glad that you called.

33:43.833 --> 33:45.499
- It has been months.
- I know.

33:45.500 --> 33:47.124
This place is driving me crazy.

33:47.125 --> 33:48.915
- Have you heard about Abby?
- Yes.

33:48.916 --> 33:51.499
She's leaving to have a baby,
which, okay, good for her.

33:51.500 --> 33:53.957
But guess who's been told
she can't have maternity cover?

33:53.958 --> 33:56.749
So now I'm down a team member for spring,
and I'm already drowning.

33:56.750 --> 33:57.666
Oh no.

33:58.541 --> 34:00.458
[suspenseful music continues]

34:02.291 --> 34:03.583
[music stops]

34:06.333 --> 34:07.625
[cell phone buzzes]

34:09.458 --> 34:10.332
[keypad clacks]

34:10.333 --> 34:11.249
Hello?

34:11.250 --> 34:12.791
[static crackles softly]

34:13.958 --> 34:16.125
[Michael] <i>S... So, what are you, Sam?</i>

34:17.125 --> 34:18.208
<i>Who are you?</i>

34:20.416 --> 34:21.333
Um, I'm...

34:24.541 --> 34:28.000
[Michael] <i>If it helps,
nothing you can say can make it worse.</i>

34:28.583 --> 34:29.458
[chuckles wryly]

34:34.791 --> 34:36.500
I'm what's known as a triggerman.

34:39.291 --> 34:40.708
I kill people for money.

34:41.750 --> 34:42.790
[Michael] <i>Oh.</i>

34:42.791 --> 34:45.333
Um... [inhales deeply]

34:46.208 --> 34:47.874
How many people have you--

34:47.875 --> 34:49.625
[Sam] <i>I don't want to say.</i>

34:50.625 --> 34:53.833
Just... just give me a ballpark number.

34:54.500 --> 34:56.041
More than 20.

34:57.583 --> 34:58.791
Less than 50.

35:00.750 --> 35:02.249
<i>That made it worse, didn't it?</i>

35:02.250 --> 35:04.458
[scoffs, gulps] I dunno.

35:06.541 --> 35:07.415
[Sam] <i>Michael?</i>

35:07.416 --> 35:09.332
I'm so sorry. I'm...

35:09.333 --> 35:12.125
I ca... Can I call you back... in a minute?

35:12.708 --> 35:15.165
Uh, I... I'd like to keep talking.

35:15.166 --> 35:16.832
Are you at work?

35:16.833 --> 35:17.750
No.

35:18.416 --> 35:19.500
I mean... No.

35:21.166 --> 35:23.999
What? You're not gonna garrote someone?

35:24.000 --> 35:25.083
No, no. No.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.332
God, no. I mean, I never... No.

35:28.333 --> 35:30.125
Um, anyway... Um...

35:31.333 --> 35:33.666
I'll call you back in a minute. So sorry.

35:34.541 --> 35:36.790
[line ringing]

35:36.791 --> 35:37.915
[line clicks]

35:37.916 --> 35:41.915
Hello. Um, could I speak
to Vanessa Robinson, please,

35:41.916 --> 35:43.415
as a matter of urgency?

35:43.416 --> 35:46.582
[Vanessa] ...do what my mother did
and stay miserable just to make a point.

35:46.583 --> 35:48.582
Obviously, I went home for Thanksgiving.

35:48.583 --> 35:51.332
So, um, I think me and Tim
are just gonna spend Christmas here.

35:51.333 --> 35:53.665
- Right.
- To tell you the truth, I'm relieved--

35:53.666 --> 35:56.415
Vanessa, there's a call for you.
Sounds urgent.

35:56.416 --> 35:58.041
- Okay. Two minutes.
- Okay.

35:59.000 --> 35:59.915
I'll wait here.

35:59.916 --> 36:02.000
[suspenseful music plays]

36:03.000 --> 36:04.790
[indistinct chatter]

36:04.791 --> 36:07.082
[woman] You could freeze some juice.

36:07.083 --> 36:09.540
[man] Really? I... I gotta go.
I'll see you there.

36:09.541 --> 36:11.625
[indistinct chatter continues]

36:12.875 --> 36:14.875
[suspenseful music continues]

36:16.750 --> 36:19.583
- Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- [man] Pardon me.

36:25.625 --> 36:27.832
- [Vanessa] This is Vanessa.
- [Sam] <i>Hello, Mrs. Robinson.</i>

36:27.833 --> 36:32.124
<i>I'm calling from the Metropolitan Police
Protection Command Unit,</i>

36:32.125 --> 36:35.540
<i>and I need to speak to you
about your security detail.</i>

36:35.541 --> 36:37.207
[Vanessa] I don't have a security detail.

36:37.208 --> 36:39.915
[Sam] <i>Yes, and we're increasingly
concerned about that.</i>

36:39.916 --> 36:43.624
- [Vanessa] <i>Why? Has something happened?</i>
- There's a credible threat to your life.

- Trent is a... trust fund baby moron.

48:35.500 --> 48:38.499
He is a fucking idiot. He's the weak link.

48:38.500 --> 48:40.332
Trent was working for the Clarks?

48:40.333 --> 48:43.665
No, no, no.
Trent doesn't work for the Clarks.

48:43.666 --> 48:45.999
He <i>is</i> a Clark.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.458
His mother, Alex Clark,

48:49.833 --> 48:52.040
she's the head of the London operation.

48:52.041 --> 48:55.291
We had just worked this out when
Chen's murder stalled our investigation.

48:55.791 --> 48:58.124
Now, my educated guess

48:58.125 --> 49:01.707
is that the Clarks know what happened
to the Chinese ambassador.

49:01.708 --> 49:03.790
Because they're trying
to scrub all the evidence

49:03.791 --> 49:06.124
of what happened
in Kai-Ming's apartment that night.

49:06.125 --> 49:08.332
But the Chinese think you're the murderer.

49:08.333 --> 49:10.582
[Cole] Yeah, they wish it was me.

49:10.583 --> 49:14.499
A black ops CIA agent
murders their ambassador to the UK.

49:14.500 --> 49:17.040
Just... just think about
what they could do with that.

49:17.041 --> 49:20.583
- Yeah, right.
- The Clarks own everybody.

49:21.333 --> 49:22.332
I am serious now.

49:22.333 --> 49:26.165
If these people are after you,
it is <i>when</i>, not <i>if</i> they get you.

49:48.833 --> 49:51.416
Look, I've told you everything I can.

49:52.166 --> 49:54.124
You need to hold up
your end of the bargain.

49:54.125 --> 49:56.291
Yeah, don't worry. You'll get your money.

49:57.625 --> 49:59.958
Money? What money?

50:01.791 --> 50:05.375
Like, I... I just wanna know
my family are safe, that's... that's all.

50:07.375 --> 50:09.250
Why would somebody hurt your family?

50:10.041 --> 50:11.500
This is fucking ridiculous.

50:13.166 --> 50:15.290
Look. See that?

50:15.291 --> 50:18.332
That's my parents,
my sister, and my two nephews.

50:18.333 --> 50:21.499
I... I came with you,
so just... just let them go.

50:21.500 --> 50:25.499
But, wait, that wasn't what Reed said.
That... that... This wasn't a--

[tense music plays]

50:27.833 --> 50:28.750
Dani?

50:30.583 --> 50:31.791
What rumor have you heard?

50:34.875 --> 50:36.333
She's unfaithful to you.

50:37.916 --> 50:40.166
It was an affair, some civil servant.

50:40.750 --> 50:41.957
[Chang Hao] Cole Atwood!

50:41.958 --> 50:43.040
Oh my God.

50:43.041 --> 50:45.124
Christ! Are those Chinese agents?

50:45.125 --> 50:46.875
[tense music continues]

50:48.041 --> 50:50.832
I know my wife,
and she wouldn't do that, so...

50:50.833 --> 50:52.333
[tense music continues]

50:53.666 --> 50:56.083
No one knows anyone completely, Wallace.

50:56.791 --> 50:57.875
Not really.

50:59.500 --> 51:02.457
- [Chang Hao] Get out of the car!
- Sorry, is that who you were working for?

51:02.458 --> 51:04.957
- Helen?
- Can you help me get to Alex Clark?

51:04.958 --> 51:06.165
[Sam] Helen?

51:06.166 --> 51:08.582
Listen, I will do everything I can
to keep your family safe.

51:08.583 --> 51:10.874
- Can you help me get to the Clarks?
- Yes. Yes, I can try.

51:10.875 --> 51:12.750
- Okay, fuck it. Sam?
