00:13.555 --> 00:15.641
You know,

00:13.555 --> 00:15.641
I had a hand in naming it.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.935
And it's great, although you

00:15.683 --> 00:17.935
might wanna try shortening it,

00:17.977 --> 00:19.102
maybe using a cool acronym.

Why did Scully open a package

03:46.810 --> 03:47.853
Perhaps he was

05:14.481 --> 05:15.941
and we were supposed

05:15.983 --> 05:17.442
to have lunch tomorrow,

05:15.983 --> 05:17.442
but I asked him to come down

05:17.484 --> 05:19.319
because I need an objective

05:17.484 --> 05:19.319
set of eyes on this.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.029
-I can be objective.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.029
-Then tell me.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.614
-How do I look today?

05:21.071 --> 05:22.614
-Normal?

05:22.656 --> 05:24.241
-No. Dillman?

05:22.656 --> 05:24.241
-Bloated.

05:24.283 --> 05:26.285
Thank you.

05:24.283 --> 05:26.285
Dillman is the single

05:24.283 --> 05:26.285
best detective

05:26.326 --> 05:27.702
I have ever worked with.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.204
Sadly, he was unjustly fired

05:27.744 --> 05:29.204
for investigating

05:29.246 --> 05:31.206
corruption in the NYPD.

05:31.248 --> 05:32.540
He hated dirty cops so much

05:32.582 --> 05:34.668
they used to call him

05:32.582 --> 05:34.668
Mr. Clean.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.004
Uh-huh, I'm sure

05:34.709 --> 05:37.004
that's the only reason

05:34.709 --> 05:37.004
they called him that.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.713
Because I'm bald?

05:37.045 --> 05:38.713
You think that's funny?

05:38.755 --> 05:40.924
I started shaving my head

05:38.755 --> 05:40.924
20 years ago in solidarity

05:40.966 --> 05:43.426
with my mother who was

05:40.966 --> 05:43.426
undergoing chemotherapy.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.386
Oh, look, I'm so sorry--

05:45.428 --> 05:47.889
I'm obviously lying. It's

05:45.428 --> 05:47.889
classic male pattern baldness.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.557
But now,

05:47.931 --> 05:49.557
based on your reaction,

05:49.599 --> 05:52.144
I know every single thing

05:49.599 --> 05:52.144
about you as a person.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.854
-That can't be true.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.854
-[Holt] It is.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.772
-You're cooked.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.772
-All right, let's get started.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.356
I want written statements

05:55.814 --> 05:57.356
from every witness--

05:57.398 --> 05:59.818
personnel files

05:57.398 --> 05:59.818
for the entire squad.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.237
Of course, I need to have

05:59.860 --> 06:02.237
this desk dusted for prints,

06:02.279 --> 06:04.239
see if we get a hit

06:02.279 --> 06:04.239
on the AFI system.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.991
Somebody could maybe get rid

06:04.281 --> 06:05.991
of those pigeons.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.327
And, of course, I'll need

06:06.033 --> 06:08.327
to see any surveillance video.

06:08.367 --> 06:09.911
Unfortunately,

06:08.367 --> 06:09.911
this area's a blind spot.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.955
The camera that covers it

06:09.953 --> 06:11.955
broke two weeks ago,

06:11.997 --> 06:13.540
and it hasn't been fixed yet.

06:13.581 --> 06:14.875
Really don't want me

06:13.581 --> 06:14.875
to see that security footage,

06:14.916 --> 06:16.335
do you, Lieutenant?

06:16.375 --> 06:19.296
-Hm, I wonder why.

06:16.375 --> 06:19.296
-I was just stating the facts.

06:19.338 --> 06:20.839
I didn't do anything

06:19.338 --> 06:20.839
to the camera.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.299
I never thought you did,

06:20.881 --> 06:22.299
but now I know

06:22.341 --> 06:23.800
every single thing

06:22.341 --> 06:23.800
about you as a person.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.344
[Holt]

06:23.842 --> 06:25.344
Everyone back off.

06:25.384 --> 06:27.554
Dillman has the scene.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.640
Man, this sucks.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.267
This case would have been

06:30.682 --> 06:32.267
the perfect chance for you

06:32.309 --> 06:34.019
to prove to Holt that you

06:32.309 --> 06:34.019
deserve that task force.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.437
Yeah.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.437
Maybe it still is.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.190
Holt thinks Dillman's

06:36.479 --> 06:38.190
the best detective

06:38.232 --> 06:39.566
he's ever worked with,

06:38.232 --> 06:39.566
so what happens

06:39.607 --> 06:40.942
if I solve the case before him?

06:40.984 --> 06:42.777
Then I become the best

06:40.984 --> 06:42.777
detective Holt has ever

06:42.819 --> 06:44.654
worked with, and he has

06:42.819 --> 06:44.654
to give me the task force.

06:44.696 --> 06:46.365
Dillman thinks he knows

06:44.696 --> 06:46.365
everything about me

06:46.405 --> 06:48.658
as a person, but there's

06:46.405 --> 06:48.658
one thing he doesn't know.

06:48.700 --> 06:49.910
I'm about to take him down--

06:49.951 --> 06:51.328
oh, my God,

06:49.951 --> 06:51.328
he's staring right at us.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.996
Quick, pretend like

06:51.370 --> 06:52.996
I was saying something else.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.082
Yes, Jake, you were young

06:53.038 --> 06:55.082
when you lost your virginity.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.499
Thank you, Charles!

06:59.253 --> 07:01.629
The DA's office called.

06:59.253 --> 07:01.629
Greene is furious.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.715
He thinks he may have to drop

07:01.671 --> 07:03.715
all charges in the Dekalb case.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.967
Whoever did this is facing

07:03.757 --> 07:05.967
a massive suspension,

07:06.009 --> 07:07.386
and there's no use hiding

07:07.426 --> 07:09.179
because Dillman

07:07.426 --> 07:09.179
will smoke you out.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.639
Right, but is there any way

07:09.221 --> 07:11.639
he could hurry it up?

07:11.681 --> 07:13.892
So far it's just been a lot

07:11.681 --> 07:13.892
of silent pacing.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.311
Would you ask a heart surgeon

07:13.934 --> 07:16.311
to hurry it up?

07:16.353 --> 07:17.771
I mean, I would if he was

07:16.353 --> 07:17.771
just walking around a room.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.480
[Dillman]

07:17.812 --> 07:19.480
Okay, here's what we know.

07:19.522 --> 07:22.234
The glitter bomb was placed

07:19.522 --> 07:22.234
between 12:20 and 12:55.

07:22.276 --> 07:24.986
All the suspects say

07:22.276 --> 07:24.986
they were at lunch

07:25.028 --> 07:26.529
and have an alibi

07:25.028 --> 07:26.529
for that time,

07:26.571 --> 07:29.157
which means

07:26.571 --> 07:29.157
one of you is lying.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.658
It was Terry.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.202
Thanks for coming by, Dill,

07:30.700 --> 07:32.202
but I got it from here.

07:32.244 --> 07:34.371
You see, Terrence,

07:32.244 --> 07:34.371
I couldn't help but notice

07:34.413 --> 07:36.123
you're not wearing

07:34.413 --> 07:36.123
suspenders today--

07:36.164 --> 07:39.418
odd, considering suspenders

07:36.164 --> 07:39.418
are your entire personality.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.752
Seems a little reductive.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.254
I had a rough childhood,

07:42.296 --> 07:43.797
but I lifted myself up

07:42.296 --> 07:43.797
through arts and athletics--

07:43.838 --> 07:45.548
Ah-buh-buh-buhp.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.548
You're the suspenders guy.

07:45.590 --> 07:48.885
Something felt fishy,

07:45.590 --> 07:48.885
so Jakey went fishing,

07:48.927 --> 07:50.470
and I caught me a fat one.

07:50.511 --> 07:52.055
And look at that--

07:52.097 --> 07:54.557
Terry's suspenders

07:52.097 --> 07:54.557
stuffed into his desk drawer,

07:54.599 --> 07:57.644
and there's glitter on them,

07:54.599 --> 07:57.644
red glitter.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.439
Feels like that deserved

07:58.728 --> 08:00.439
an audible gasp.

08:00.521 --> 08:01.773
-[gasps loudly]

08:00.521 --> 08:01.773
-Thank you, Charles.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.233
You got messy

08:01.815 --> 08:03.233
setting up the prank.

08:03.275 --> 08:04.692
You didn't want

08:03.275 --> 08:04.692
anyone to see.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.194
You put the suspenders

08:04.734 --> 08:06.194
in your desk drawer.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.821
Case closed.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.072
Did you put that folder there

08:07.862 --> 08:09.072
just so you could close it?

08:09.114 --> 08:10.365
Yes, Rosa, obviously.

08:10.407 --> 08:11.616
I didn't do anything.

08:11.658 --> 08:12.742
Well, if you didn't

08:11.658 --> 08:12.742
do anything,

08:12.784 --> 08:14.077
how come the case is closed?

08:14.119 --> 08:15.412
-It's not.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.412
-Hm?

08:15.454 --> 08:16.871
The glitter

08:15.454 --> 08:16.871
on Jeffords' suspenders

08:16.913 --> 08:19.791
is type 9A round red glitter

08:16.913 --> 08:19.791
while the bomb spewed

08:19.833 --> 08:22.002
type 9C round red glitter,

08:19.833 --> 08:22.002
but then I suppose

08:22.043 --> 08:24.296
all round red glitter

08:22.043 --> 08:24.296
looks the same to you.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.547
No.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.547
I know the difference.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.384
-One is bigger?

08:28.049 --> 08:29.384
-Shinier.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.136
-Ah.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.136
-The number refers

08:29.426 --> 08:31.136
to the size.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.846
The letter refers

08:31.178 --> 08:32.846
to its reflective qualities.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.639
Seems like you know a weird

08:32.887 --> 08:34.639
amount about glitter, man.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.434
So good detective work

08:34.681 --> 08:37.434
is weird to you?

08:37.476 --> 08:39.269
Interesting squad

08:37.476 --> 08:39.269
you have here, Raymond.

08:39.311 --> 08:40.895
I didn't choose them.

08:39.311 --> 08:40.895
They were here when I arrived.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.022
Understood.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.440
The real question is

08:42.063 --> 08:43.440
why Jeffords

08:43.482 --> 08:44.816
had glitter on him at all.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.318
Fortunately, I have the answer.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.320
I deduced that he has

08:46.360 --> 08:48.320
three young daughters--

08:48.362 --> 08:49.737
twins and a toddler.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.656
Big deal. You saw the picture

08:49.779 --> 08:51.656
on his desk.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.574
I did, and judging by

08:53.616 --> 08:55.660
the maple trees in

08:53.616 --> 08:55.660
the background of that picture,

08:55.702 --> 08:58.079
it was taken last fall--

08:55.702 --> 08:58.079
probably mid October.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.874
The twins are smiling,

08:58.121 --> 09:00.874
each revealing a missing tooth.

09:00.915 --> 09:03.251
The twin on the right--

09:00.915 --> 09:03.251
let's call her "Twin A."

09:03.293 --> 09:04.752
-That's Cagney.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.752
-Is that relevant?

09:04.794 --> 09:06.171
-It's her name.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.171
-So no.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.006
Twin A is missing

09:06.213 --> 09:08.006
an upper right incisor

09:08.048 --> 09:10.675
while Twin B is missing

09:08.048 --> 09:10.675
a lower left incisor

09:10.717 --> 09:12.844
suggesting that they were seven

09:10.717 --> 09:12.844
when the photo was taken,

09:12.886 --> 09:14.471
which would put them

09:12.886 --> 09:14.471
in second grade.

09:14.513 --> 09:16.306
Spring semester

09:14.513 --> 09:16.306
of second grade is when

09:16.348 --> 09:19.059
the Brooklyn schools

09:16.348 --> 09:19.059
do their solar system unit,

09:19.100 --> 09:20.560
a highlight of which

09:19.100 --> 09:20.560
is constructing

09:20.601 --> 09:22.020
a mobile of the planets.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.772
My hypothesis is that Twin A

09:22.062 --> 09:24.772
and Twin B requested

09:24.814 --> 09:28.527
Daddy's help making Mars

09:24.814 --> 09:28.527
sparkle, hence the red glitter.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.862
Damn, yeah,

09:28.568 --> 09:30.862
that's exactly right.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.239
Just seems like

09:30.904 --> 09:32.239
a very complicated way

09:32.280 --> 09:33.614
-of saying Terry has kids.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.614
-Thank you.

09:33.656 --> 09:34.782
What?

09:34.824 --> 09:36.159
The point is,

09:34.824 --> 09:36.159
Jeffords is innocent,

09:36.201 --> 09:39.037
so I guess it's fair to say

09:36.201 --> 09:39.037
case open.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.081
My God, I have gooseflesh.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.166
So now I'd like to move on

09:41.122 --> 09:43.166
to a real suspect.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.626
I wanna see detective Diaz

09:43.208 --> 09:45.626
in the box.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.338
-[gasps]

09:45.668 --> 09:48.338
-What--don't gasp for him.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.338
What are you doing?

09:48.380 --> 09:50.298
-I'm sorry. It just slipped out.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.298
-Title of your sex tape.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.550
Yeah, it's--obviously...

09:51.591 --> 09:52.633
...it's the title

09:51.591 --> 09:52.633
of his sex tape.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.302
Everyone's taking my stuff.

09:54.344 --> 09:55.970
[tense music]

10:01.142 --> 10:03.019
Dillman never talks first

10:01.142 --> 10:03.019
when he's in the box.

10:03.061 --> 10:06.064
Well, Rosa never initiates

10:03.061 --> 10:06.064
conversation of any kind.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.982
Guys, I really

10:06.106 --> 10:07.982
have to get out of here.

10:08.024 --> 10:10.318
<i>Somebody please say something</i>

10:08.024 --> 10:10.318
<i>to get it started.</i>

10:10.360 --> 10:11.861
-No.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.861
-And there it is.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.030
Now that I have the upper hand,

10:11.903 --> 10:14.030
let's get started.

10:14.072 --> 10:15.907
Stupid Terry

10:14.072 --> 10:15.907
and his stupid kids.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.701
<i>You were the only suspect</i>

10:15.949 --> 10:18.701
<i>who did not go</i> out<i> for lunch,</i>

10:18.743 --> 10:20.412
but if you were eating

10:18.743 --> 10:20.412
at your desk,

10:20.454 --> 10:21.621
how did you not see

10:20.454 --> 10:21.621
the perpetrator

10:21.662 --> 10:23.081
plant the glitter bomb?

10:23.123 --> 10:24.374
I wasn't at my desk.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.374
I was in the break room.

10:24.416 --> 10:25.750
Oh, the break room.

10:24.416 --> 10:25.750
That explains it.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.127
I guess we're done here.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.879
Oh, here it comes--

10:27.168 --> 10:29.879
the Dillman double back.

10:30.671 --> 10:31.965
Just to double back--

10:32.006 --> 10:33.800
Oh, my.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.800
He actually said the words.

10:33.841 --> 10:35.009
What a treat.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.470
<i>If you were</i>

10:35.051 --> 10:36.470
<i>in the break room,</i>

10:36.511 --> 10:38.430
why was the IP address

10:36.511 --> 10:38.430
of your laptop

10:38.472 --> 10:40.765
logged into the Wi-Fi

10:38.472 --> 10:40.765
on the fifth floor?

10:40.807 --> 10:42.434
Fine.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.394
There's an empty office there

10:42.476 --> 10:44.394
where I go to be alone.

10:44.436 --> 10:48.815
Seems innocent enough.

10:44.436 --> 10:48.815
Why would you lie about that?

10:48.856 --> 10:51.485
Maybe because you were up there

10:48.856 --> 10:51.485
assembling a glitter bomb.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.861
[mumbles]

10:53.903 --> 10:56.030
-I'm sorry, I didn't--

10:53.903 --> 10:56.030
-I was watching a soap opera.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.949
It's called<i> Drake's Hollow.</i>

10:56.072 --> 10:57.949
I never miss an episode.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.076
It's my mother's favorite show,

10:57.991 --> 11:00.076
and when things were bad

11:00.118 --> 11:02.579
between us, it was the one thing

11:00.118 --> 11:02.579
that we could still talk about.

11:02.621 --> 11:03.580
Oh, that's sweet.

11:03.622 --> 11:04.872
It is kind of sweet.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.874
Sweet enough to fool

11:04.914 --> 11:06.874
a lesser detective.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.793
What--I wasn't fooled.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.793
Take her away.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.920
If you really watch

11:08.835 --> 11:10.920
<i>Drake's Hollow</i> every day,

11:10.962 --> 11:12.671
you won't mind if I

11:10.962 --> 11:12.671
give you a little quiz.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.715
You see, I've been known

11:12.713 --> 11:14.715
to visit the Hollow myself

11:14.757 --> 11:17.344
from time to time not unlike

11:14.757 --> 11:17.344
Nicholas Van Bronderberg.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.720
Who's the father

11:17.385 --> 11:19.720
of Eliana's twins?

11:19.762 --> 11:20.930
Christian is Jacob's father,

11:20.972 --> 11:22.390
but Joshua was stolen

11:20.972 --> 11:22.390
from the hospital.

11:22.432 --> 11:23.850
His real father

11:22.432 --> 11:23.850
remains unknown.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.226
Who did Joshua

11:23.891 --> 11:25.226
grow up to marry?

11:25.268 --> 11:26.394
First came Sandra,

11:25.268 --> 11:26.394
then there was Brigitte,

11:26.436 --> 11:27.646
but she turned out

11:26.436 --> 11:27.646
to be his sister.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.439
<i>Katherine died</i>

11:27.686 --> 11:29.439
<i>during childbirth,</i>

11:29.481 --> 11:30.898
<i>though it was later revealed</i>

11:29.481 --> 11:30.898
<i>that she was murdered</i>

11:30.940 --> 11:32.150
<i>by Amanda,</i>

11:30.940 --> 11:32.150
<i>Joshua's next wife.</i>

11:32.192 --> 11:33.276
They divorced after Amanda

11:33.318 --> 11:34.569
was sentenced

11:33.318 --> 11:34.569
to the electric chair.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.446
But Joshua rebounded quickly

11:34.611 --> 11:36.446
with Jasmine.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.114
Jasmine was followed by Grace,

11:36.488 --> 11:38.114
the love of his life,

11:38.156 --> 11:39.824
but she had a contract dispute

11:38.156 --> 11:39.824
with the producers

11:39.866 --> 11:41.451
so she was killed

11:39.866 --> 11:41.451
off camera by a snake.

11:41.493 --> 11:42.869
[chuckles]

11:41.493 --> 11:42.869
You messed up.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.038
-You forgot Gwendolyn.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.038
-No, I didn't.

11:45.079 --> 11:47.040
Joshua and Gwendolyn were

11:45.079 --> 11:47.040
technically never married

11:47.081 --> 11:49.792
because that whole season took

11:47.081 --> 11:49.792
place inside Kiki's mind...

11:49.834 --> 11:51.961
[whispering]

11:49.834 --> 11:51.961
While she was in a coma.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.589
<i>Diaz is innocent.</i>

11:54.631 --> 11:56.675
So I guess he was wrong

11:54.631 --> 11:56.675
about Rosa.

11:56.715 --> 11:58.385
Don't worry about Dillman.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.512
He's the best detective

11:58.426 --> 12:00.512
I've ever worked with.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.138
Or you just

12:00.554 --> 12:02.138
keep talking him up

12:02.180 --> 12:04.098
because you don't want us

12:02.180 --> 12:04.098
to notice how weird it is

12:04.140 --> 12:05.600
that you brought in a friend

12:04.140 --> 12:05.600
to work the case.

12:05.642 --> 12:06.893
We're not friends.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.395
My only friends

12:06.934 --> 12:08.395
are James and Julian.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.021
Hurtful, but I still

12:08.436 --> 12:10.021
think it's strange

12:10.063 --> 12:11.523
that you won't let me

12:10.063 --> 12:11.523
run the investigation--

12:11.565 --> 12:12.982
unless, of course,

12:11.565 --> 12:12.982
there's something

12:13.024 --> 12:14.568
-you're scared I might find.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.568
-Excuse me?

12:14.609 --> 12:16.777
Where were you between

12:14.609 --> 12:16.777
12:20 and 12:55?

12:16.819 --> 12:18.238
You aren't

12:16.819 --> 12:18.238
seriously suggesting

12:18.279 --> 12:19.531
that I am the prank man.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.157
It does seem

12:19.573 --> 12:21.157
a little far-fetched, Jake.

12:21.199 --> 12:23.243
I mean, he did just use

12:21.199 --> 12:23.243
the phrase, "prank man."

12:23.284 --> 12:24.661
It's not far-fetched at all.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.913
Holt is not the joyless robot

12:24.703 --> 12:26.913
that he once was.

12:26.954 --> 12:28.747
Is this about the time

12:26.954 --> 12:28.747
I ate a burrito?

12:28.789 --> 12:29.874
I was pressured into it.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.501
Just tell us where

12:29.916 --> 12:31.501
you were at lunch.

12:31.543 --> 12:32.835
Well, if you must know,

12:31.543 --> 12:32.835
I was having lunch with Boyle.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.170
[Jake laughs]

12:32.877 --> 12:34.170
No way.

12:34.212 --> 12:35.505
You two are

12:34.212 --> 12:35.505
the second most unlikely

12:35.547 --> 12:36.881
Nine-Nine lunch combination.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.592
First is anyone

12:36.923 --> 12:38.592
with Hitchcock and Scully.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.218
Second is Holt and Charles.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.553
It is pretty strange.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.388
I mean, obviously

12:41.595 --> 12:43.388
it was uncomfortable,

12:43.430 --> 12:44.556
but it was a work lunch.

12:44.598 --> 12:45.724
Look, it's not

12:44.598 --> 12:45.724
a big deal, guys.

12:45.764 --> 12:47.100
We don't have to talk about it.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.935
I was offering him

12:47.141 --> 12:48.935
the task force position.

12:48.976 --> 12:51.104
Boyle is my choice.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.022
Boyle?

12:53.064 --> 12:53.940
From work?

12:53.981 --> 12:56.526
[chuckles]

12:53.981 --> 12:56.526
Oh.

12:56.568 --> 12:59.446
How great for him...

12:56.568 --> 12:59.446
[laughs] And no one else.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.239
You know what, I just remembered

12:59.487 --> 13:01.239
that I'm late to leave.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.532
Gotta go, bye.

13:04.783 --> 13:06.453
Hey.

13:06.494 --> 13:07.828
I don't understand, Charles.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.414
If Holt already assigned you

13:07.870 --> 13:09.414
to the task force,

13:09.456 --> 13:10.665
why were you helping me

13:09.456 --> 13:10.665
try and get it?

13:10.707 --> 13:13.042
I was planning

13:10.707 --> 13:13.042
on telling Holt no.

13:13.084 --> 13:14.127
What?

13:13.084 --> 13:14.127
That's insane.

13:14.168 --> 13:15.754
It's a huge opportunity.

13:15.794 --> 13:17.838
I know, but I've been meaning

13:15.794 --> 13:17.838
to cut back on hours.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.340
I'm working too much.

13:19.382 --> 13:20.967
It's affecting Nikolaj

13:19.382 --> 13:20.967
at school.

13:21.008 --> 13:22.885
He's been making

13:21.008 --> 13:22.885
so many new friends.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.262
Wait,

13:22.927 --> 13:24.262
isn't that a good thing?

13:24.304 --> 13:25.722
No, he's trying

13:24.304 --> 13:25.722
to get me jealous.

13:25.764 --> 13:26.847
I did the same thing to my dad.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.807
So, Jake, for real.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.143
I'm not gonna take

13:28.849 --> 13:30.143
the assignment.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.019
[sighs]

13:30.184 --> 13:32.019
Okay, I guess that makes sense.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.648
But just promise me you're not

13:32.061 --> 13:34.648
turning it down because of me.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.483
Jake, I promise.

13:36.524 --> 13:37.692
Okay.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.654
Great, well,

13:40.695 --> 13:42.155
if you're turning it down,

13:40.695 --> 13:42.155
that means there's still

13:42.196 --> 13:43.531
an opportunity for me

13:42.196 --> 13:43.531
to solve the case

13:43.573 --> 13:45.199
and prove to Holt

13:43.573 --> 13:45.199
I belong on the task force.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.076
-What task force?

13:45.241 --> 13:47.076
-[surprised grunt]

13:47.118 --> 13:48.745
-How long have you been here?

13:47.118 --> 13:48.745
-Just a few seconds.

13:48.787 --> 13:50.204
But that was

13:48.787 --> 13:50.204
more than enough time

13:50.246 --> 13:51.914
for me to ascertain

13:50.246 --> 13:51.914
everything about you--

13:51.956 --> 13:54.167
As a person, yes, we know.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.167
No one likes a know-it-all.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.669
You're married to one.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.253
<i>-You're</i> married to one.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.253
-Follow me.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.046
I have an important

13:57.295 --> 13:59.046
announcement to make.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.508
[both] Dillman.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.092
May I have everyone's

14:01.549 --> 14:03.092
attention please?

14:03.134 --> 14:05.512
I have solved the

14:03.134 --> 14:05.512
"who has done this."

14:05.553 --> 14:07.430
I know by whom it was done.

14:07.472 --> 14:08.973
-It was Jake Peralta.

14:07.472 --> 14:08.973
-[Jake] What?

14:09.015 --> 14:11.142
That's crazy.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.142
The box was on my desk.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.602
-I'm the victim.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.602
-[Hitchcock] Wrong.

14:12.644 --> 14:14.521
-Scully's the victim.

14:12.644 --> 14:14.521
-Yeah!

14:14.562 --> 14:15.980
You think glitter's gonna taste

14:14.562 --> 14:15.980
like sprinkles, but it doesn't.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.440
-It tastes like blood.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.440
-That is blood.

14:17.482 --> 14:18.817
The glitter's

14:17.482 --> 14:18.817
shredding your tongue.

14:18.857 --> 14:20.777
-Oh.

14:18.857 --> 14:20.777
-Why would I blow up

14:18.857 --> 14:20.777
my own desk?

14:20.819 --> 14:22.278
For the task force.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.697
I just heard you say

14:22.320 --> 14:23.697
you wanted to prove to Holt

14:23.738 --> 14:25.114
that you're

14:23.738 --> 14:25.114
a great detective.

14:25.156 --> 14:26.658
That's why you set

14:25.156 --> 14:26.658
this whole thing up.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.284
It was a perfect plan,

14:28.326 --> 14:29.786
and you would've gotten away

14:28.326 --> 14:29.786
with it if not for me.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.245
Wow.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.245
You're a lunatic.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.080
Would a lunatic know

14:31.287 --> 14:33.080
that your body temperature

14:33.122 --> 14:35.500
just rose 9/10 of a degree

14:33.122 --> 14:35.500
indicating guilt?

14:35.542 --> 14:37.293
-Yes.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.293
-Oh, look.

14:38.545 --> 14:39.713
What do we have here--

14:39.754 --> 14:41.255
a receipt from Party Zone

14:41.297 --> 14:42.965
for one air tank rental

14:41.297 --> 14:42.965
paid in cash.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.967
That's not mine.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.967
I never keep my receipts.

14:45.009 --> 14:46.344
Amy, tell them.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.679
Tell them how much

14:46.386 --> 14:47.679
our accountant hates me.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.013
She hates him so much.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.390
My bag was sitting

14:49.055 --> 14:50.390
next to my desk.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.016
Anyone could have

14:50.431 --> 14:52.016
put that in there.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.267
That kind of evidence

14:52.058 --> 14:53.267
would never hold up at trial.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.561
You'd be laughed out of court.

14:54.602 --> 14:55.978
I've only been laughed at

14:54.602 --> 14:55.978
in court once,

14:56.020 --> 14:57.564
and that was because

14:56.020 --> 14:57.564
I made a terrific joke.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.273
I was there.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.273
It was hilarious.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.525
Come on.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.610
I guess it's fair to say

15:00.567 --> 15:02.610
case closed.

15:02.652 --> 15:03.862
No.

15:02.652 --> 15:03.862
He stole that from me.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.238
[Holt] Go home.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.407
You're suspended

15:05.279 --> 15:07.407
until further notice.

15:07.448 --> 15:08.616
This is nuts.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.159
I can't believe

15:08.658 --> 15:10.159
Holt believes

15:10.201 --> 15:12.370
that ridiculous windbag

15:10.201 --> 15:12.370
and his sack of lies.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.955
Oh, I know everything about

15:12.412 --> 15:14.955
glitter and "Drake's Elbow."

15:14.997 --> 15:16.416
-"Hollow."

15:14.997 --> 15:16.416
-Amy, please.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.626
I just need your support

15:16.457 --> 15:18.626
right now, okay?

15:18.668 --> 15:20.086
Wait a minute,

15:18.668 --> 15:20.086
you believe me, right?

15:20.127 --> 15:21.880
Of course I do.

15:20.127 --> 15:21.880
I'm your wife.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.297
I'm on your side

15:21.921 --> 15:23.297
no matter what.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.591
[sighs]

15:23.339 --> 15:24.591
Thanks.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.050
-Same, by the way.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.050
-Thanks.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.510
I mean,

15:26.092 --> 15:27.510
no one really suspects me.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.095
-Right.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.095
-Look, go home.

15:29.136 --> 15:31.013
I'll check for prints

15:29.136 --> 15:31.013
on the Party Zone receipt.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.391
Yours won't be there,

15:31.055 --> 15:33.391
but maybe someone else's will.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.602
Wait a minute.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.602
Prints--that's it.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.228
I think I know who framed me.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.855
-Who?

15:37.270 --> 15:38.855
-I can't say yet.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.855
I wanna be sure.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.106
You wanna do a big,

15:38.897 --> 15:40.106
dramatic reveal

15:40.147 --> 15:41.691
in front of everyone, don't you?

15:41.733 --> 15:43.276
Yes, obviously! Look, I have

15:41.733 --> 15:43.276
to go check on one thing.

15:43.317 --> 15:44.652
-Don't let anybody leave.

15:43.317 --> 15:44.652
-'Kay.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.447
[in German accent]

15:46.112 --> 15:47.447
Attention, everyone.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.490
Stop what you are doing.

15:49.532 --> 15:50.825
[normally]

15:49.532 --> 15:50.825
Eh, still a little Nazi.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.285
I'm gonna just drop the accent.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.370
Peralta, you can't be here.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.370
You're suspended.

15:54.412 --> 15:55.830
And you're lucky

15:54.412 --> 15:55.830
it's not worse.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.248
The DA's office

15:55.872 --> 15:57.248
wanted you fired.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.500
I'm being framed,

15:57.290 --> 15:59.500
and I know who did it.

15:59.542 --> 16:00.627
It was Dillman!

16:00.668 --> 16:03.337
[scoffs]

16:00.668 --> 16:03.337
I just met you today.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.089
-Why would I do that?

16:03.379 --> 16:05.089
-Good question.

16:05.131 --> 16:08.008
It's because you want Holt

16:05.131 --> 16:08.008
to put you on that task force.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.010
Dillman can't be

16:08.050 --> 16:10.010
on a New York task force.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.805
The SFPD would never

16:10.052 --> 16:11.805
approve it.

16:11.846 --> 16:13.973
Correct, only he's not SFPD.

16:14.014 --> 16:15.391
When you first arrived,

16:14.014 --> 16:15.391
you asked us to check

16:15.433 --> 16:17.393
the fingerprints

16:15.433 --> 16:17.393
against the AFI system,

16:17.435 --> 16:20.104
but that system hasn't

16:17.435 --> 16:20.104
been used in over five years

16:20.146 --> 16:21.522
by any police department.

16:21.564 --> 16:24.901
Well, I used

16:21.564 --> 16:24.901
the AFI system for 20 years.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.945
-I guess I misspoke.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.945
-Oh, misspoke.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.154
I see.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.154
That explains everything.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.656
My apologies.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.741
I'm just gonna

16:29.697 --> 16:31.741
head back on out to exile--

16:31.783 --> 16:33.117
just to double back.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.953
My God.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.953
He's double backing Dillman.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.036
How could the best detective

16:34.994 --> 16:36.036
that Holt's ever worked with

16:36.078 --> 16:37.371
make such a mistake?

16:37.413 --> 16:38.706
I wondered myself,

16:37.413 --> 16:38.706
so I made a few phone calls.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.208
It turns out, Dillman

16:38.748 --> 16:41.208
was fired by the SFPD.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.919
I guess he rubbed the brass

16:41.250 --> 16:42.919
the wrong way.

16:42.961 --> 16:45.212
Not only that, but he's

16:42.961 --> 16:45.212
currently working part time

16:45.254 --> 16:47.256
at Yarn Barn,

16:45.254 --> 16:47.256
a hobby shop in Albany.

16:47.298 --> 16:49.467
I have his manager

16:47.298 --> 16:49.467
on the phone right now.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.719
<i>Frank, what is going on?</i>

16:49.509 --> 16:51.719
<i>You have a shift tonight.</i>

16:51.761 --> 16:53.053
<i>You know I have finals.</i>

16:53.095 --> 16:54.722
[stammers]

16:53.095 --> 16:54.722
I'm so sorry, Alyssa.

16:54.764 --> 16:57.725
I got hung up in the city.

16:54.764 --> 16:57.725
I just lost track of time.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.185
This explains everything.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.185
He's not a great detective.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.312
He's a sad man

16:59.226 --> 17:01.312
working part time

17:01.354 --> 17:03.105
selling crafting supplies.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.984
Okay, fine, yes.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.984
I was fired by the SFPD.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.527
And yes, I contacted Raymond

17:07.568 --> 17:09.153
in hopes of getting on

17:07.568 --> 17:09.153
that task force.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.155
I thought it would be my way

17:09.195 --> 17:11.155
back onto the NYPD.

17:11.197 --> 17:12.615
Oh, my God.

17:11.197 --> 17:12.615
I hate the Yarn Barn.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.492
<i>Really disappointing</i>

17:12.657 --> 17:14.492
<i>to hear, Frank,</i>

17:14.534 --> 17:16.118
Yeah, well you're

17:14.534 --> 17:16.118
a bad manager, Alyssa, okay?

17:16.160 --> 17:18.245
You play favorites and it hurts

17:16.160 --> 17:18.245
to be on the outside.

17:18.287 --> 17:19.497
<i>-You don't even show up to--</i>

17:18.287 --> 17:19.497
-Okay.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.790
I was gonna bring up

17:19.539 --> 17:20.790
the task force

17:20.832 --> 17:22.291
when I had lunch

17:20.832 --> 17:22.291
with Raymond tomorrow,

17:22.333 --> 17:24.794
but when he called about

17:22.333 --> 17:24.794
this case, I thought...

17:24.836 --> 17:26.796
-solving it would seal the deal.

17:24.836 --> 17:26.796
-Which would have been easy

17:26.838 --> 17:29.507
-since you set the whole

17:26.838 --> 17:29.507
thing up to frame me.

17:26.838 --> 17:29.507
-Ridiculous.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.509
Why would I have waited

17:29.549 --> 17:31.509
so long to accuse you?

17:31.551 --> 17:33.093
Because if you solved it

17:31.551 --> 17:33.093
right away, it would've

17:31.551 --> 17:33.093
been too obvious.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.762
He's deflecting

17:33.135 --> 17:34.762
because he's guilty.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.556
Dillman lied about

17:34.804 --> 17:36.556
where he worked.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.556
We can't trust him.

17:36.597 --> 17:37.765
The receipt was

17:36.597 --> 17:37.765
in Peralta's bag.

17:37.807 --> 17:38.975
You're the glitter expert.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.226
Well, you're

17:39.017 --> 17:40.226
the Prankmaster General.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.353
-[both] It was him.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.353
-[siren whoops]

17:42.395 --> 17:44.731
It wasn't either of you,

17:44.772 --> 17:46.941
but I know who it was.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.609
Son of a bitch

17:46.983 --> 17:48.609
stole my bullhorn.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.990
Okay, I'm not 100% sure

17:51.320 --> 17:53.990
this is right,

17:54.032 --> 17:55.783
and maybe

17:54.032 --> 17:55.783
I'm missing something--

17:55.825 --> 17:57.201
Charles, as a veteran

17:55.825 --> 17:57.201
of many big reveals,

17:57.243 --> 17:58.369
can I give you a tip?

17:58.411 --> 18:00.038
-Not so much waffling.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.038
-I agree.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.080
You're not commanding the room.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.790
Let him finish--his way.

18:02.832 --> 18:05.209
-But do pace it up

18:02.832 --> 18:05.209
a bit, Charles.

18:02.832 --> 18:05.209
-Copy that.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.253
So from the beginning,

18:05.251 --> 18:07.253
I was very skeptical

18:07.294 --> 18:09.338
that anyone in our squad

18:07.294 --> 18:09.338
was behind the prank.

18:09.380 --> 18:11.007
-Why didn't you just say that?

18:09.380 --> 18:11.007
-I did, and then you said,

18:11.049 --> 18:12.759
"That's exactly what

18:11.049 --> 18:12.759
a guilty person would say."

18:12.800 --> 18:13.885
Eh, I stand by it.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.929
Okay, so who was

18:13.927 --> 18:15.929
the prank man?

18:15.970 --> 18:16.930
There was no prank.

18:16.971 --> 18:18.264
That was just a cover.

18:18.305 --> 18:20.850
You see, guys,

18:18.305 --> 18:20.850
the point of the explosion

18:20.892 --> 18:24.144
was to contaminate the evidence

18:20.892 --> 18:24.144
of the Dekalb Street murder.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.439
But the suspect is in prison,

18:24.186 --> 18:26.439
has no ties to organized crime,

18:26.480 --> 18:27.899
and no means of

18:26.480 --> 18:27.899
bribing an officer.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.525
How could he have possibly

18:27.941 --> 18:29.525
pulled that off?

18:29.567 --> 18:31.193
Yeah, Jake, that stumped me

18:29.567 --> 18:31.193
for a little bit too,

18:31.235 --> 18:33.446
but then something you said

18:31.235 --> 18:33.446
gave me an idea.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.489
I mean, that kind of evidence

18:33.487 --> 18:35.489
would never hold up at trial.

18:35.531 --> 18:36.866
You'd be laughed out of court.

18:36.908 --> 18:38.242
Ah, yeah,

18:36.908 --> 18:38.242
I remember when I said that.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.911
It was awesome.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.911
Wait, but who did it?

18:39.953 --> 18:42.162
The mastermind

18:39.953 --> 18:42.162
was ADA Greene.

18:42.204 --> 18:44.082
He didn't have enough evidence

18:42.204 --> 18:44.082
for the case.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.332
He was afraid

18:44.123 --> 18:45.332
he was gonna lose

18:45.374 --> 18:47.001
and needed someone

18:45.374 --> 18:47.001
to blame it on.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.294
Whom did he work with--

18:48.335 --> 18:50.088
obviously someone who knew

18:48.335 --> 18:50.088
about the pranks

18:50.129 --> 18:52.298
and that Amy called Jake

18:50.129 --> 18:52.298
"babe."

18:52.339 --> 18:53.800
Excellent question, Captain.

18:53.841 --> 18:54.968
It took a little digging

18:53.841 --> 18:54.968
to find that out,

18:55.009 --> 18:56.343
but I pulled some

18:55.009 --> 18:56.343
personnel files

18:56.385 --> 18:58.387
and combed through

18:56.385 --> 18:58.387
some social media.

18:58.429 --> 19:00.347
Do you know what Greene's

18:58.429 --> 19:00.347
wife's maiden name is?

19:00.389 --> 19:01.474
-Duchovny?

19:00.389 --> 19:01.474
-No.

19:01.515 --> 19:02.558
-Zappa.

19:01.515 --> 19:02.558
-No.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.143
-Fagerbakke.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.143
-No, Booth.

19:04.184 --> 19:05.979
Howard Booth,

19:06.020 --> 19:07.063
as in, Officer Booth.

19:07.105 --> 19:09.273
Oh, yes.

19:07.105 --> 19:09.273
Officer Howard.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.775
He's Greene's brother-in-law.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.652
He didn't just put the evidence

19:10.817 --> 19:12.652
on Jake's desk.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.654
-He put the glitter bomb there.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.654
-Oh, my God.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.906
-We have to find Booth.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.906
-Already did it.

19:16.948 --> 19:18.365
And I booked him.

19:18.407 --> 19:21.327
-[elevator dings]

19:18.407 --> 19:21.327
-Oh, classic elevator reveal.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.037
This feels like it calls

19:21.368 --> 19:23.037
for an audible gasp.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.497
-[Charles gasps loudly]

19:23.079 --> 19:24.497
-Not from you, Charles.

19:24.538 --> 19:25.665
From me.

19:24.538 --> 19:25.665
[gasps loudly]

19:25.706 --> 19:26.874
[gasps loudly]

19:26.916 --> 19:28.126
Wait, did you just

19:26.916 --> 19:28.126
gasp at my gasp?

19:28.167 --> 19:30.086
Sorry.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.086
Your gasp was so good.

19:30.128 --> 19:31.587
Oh, thank you for gasping

19:30.128 --> 19:31.587
at my gasp.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.213
My pleasure.

19:34.381 --> 19:35.758
Sorry you missed

19:34.381 --> 19:35.758
your daughter's concert.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.093
No, no, it's okay.

19:37.135 --> 19:38.886
Sharon totally understood--

19:38.928 --> 19:40.847
after I lied to her

19:38.928 --> 19:40.847
and said we had to stay late

19:40.888 --> 19:42.056
because Rosa got shot.

19:42.098 --> 19:43.891
Next time you see her,

19:42.098 --> 19:43.891
walk with a limp.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.184
Copy that.

19:45.225 --> 19:46.769
[Jake] Hey,

19:46.811 --> 19:47.770
you know you don't

19:46.811 --> 19:47.770
have to sweep up, right?

19:47.812 --> 19:49.188
Well, someone's gotta.

19:49.229 --> 19:50.731
Plus it reminds me

19:49.229 --> 19:50.731
of the three years I spent

19:50.773 --> 19:52.316
as a cleaning lady in college.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.527
Huh, I guess there really

19:52.358 --> 19:54.527
is no term for cleaning man.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.320
-Mm-mm.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.320
-That's not great.

19:56.362 --> 19:57.864
So hey, listen.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.449
I wanted to say great job today

19:57.905 --> 20:00.449
and also I'm sorry.

20:00.491 --> 20:01.742
Sorry for what?

20:01.784 --> 20:03.161
Well, when I heard

20:01.784 --> 20:03.161
you got the task force,

20:03.202 --> 20:04.912
my first reaction was just

20:03.202 --> 20:04.912
to feel sad for myself

20:04.954 --> 20:06.039
instead of happy for you.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.124
Well, you sure hid it well.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.542
I really didn't.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.251
I stormed into the other room

20:09.583 --> 20:11.251
and moped by myself.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.252
Eh, but you had style.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.547
Charles, no.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.547
Look.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.465
You have to take

20:14.588 --> 20:16.465
the task force job.

20:16.507 --> 20:18.676
Really?

20:16.507 --> 20:18.676
What about Nikolaj?

20:18.718 --> 20:20.386
He's gonna be so proud

20:18.718 --> 20:20.386
of his dad.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.055
I bet he even ditches

20:20.427 --> 20:22.055
those new friends.

20:22.096 --> 20:24.098
Oh, man.

20:22.096 --> 20:24.098
That's the dream.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.266
Thank you for saying that.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.266
Honestly, though,

20:26.308 --> 20:27.894
I still don't get why

20:26.308 --> 20:27.894
Holt chose me over you.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.311
Are you kidding?

20:29.353 --> 20:30.521
I mean, just look at today.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.439
Instead of fighting

20:30.563 --> 20:32.439
for attention,

20:32.481 --> 20:34.441
you did the work and

20:32.481 --> 20:34.441
methodically built your case.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.195
You noticed things

20:34.483 --> 20:37.195
that a room full of

20:34.483 --> 20:37.195
seasoned cops all missed.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.946
You're a great detective,

20:37.236 --> 20:38.946
Charles.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.406
Wow.

20:40.447 --> 20:43.450
Even in defeat,

20:40.447 --> 20:43.450
you are a true prince of a man.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.285
-The task force is yours.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.285
-What? No.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.579
Boyle, just take the win!

20:46.620 --> 20:48.622
-Right.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.622
-It was good to see you today.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.958
I'll keep my ears open for any

20:48.664 --> 20:50.958
job opportunities that arise.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.211
Appreciate it.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.211
I could use it.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.630
Just got a text from Alyssa I've

20:53.252 --> 20:56.630
been fired by the Yarn Barn.

20:56.672 --> 20:59.258
Well, you still the best damn

20:56.672 --> 20:59.258
detective I've ever worked

20:56.672 --> 20:59.258
with.

20:59.299 --> 21:00.551
Thank you.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.095
Wait a minute.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.637
Your iris just contracted

21:02.136 --> 21:03.637
by 1/10th of a millimeter.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.139
You're lying.

21:05.181 --> 21:07.058
Yes, I've lost a lot

21:05.181 --> 21:07.058
of respect for you today.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.392
Understood.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.644
Goodbye, Raymond.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.689
Well...

21:11.812 --> 21:13.689
[sighs]

21:13.731 --> 21:16.400
Since Dillman is clearly

21:13.731 --> 21:16.400
out of the top spot now,

21:16.442 --> 21:18.152
who's the best detective

21:16.442 --> 21:18.152
you've ever worked with?

21:18.194 --> 21:20.446
It's Sergeant

21:18.194 --> 21:20.446
Leslie Hunt-Minkoff.

21:22.949 --> 21:23.908
Who?

21:23.950 --> 21:25.993
<i>-Not a doctor.</i>

21:23.950 --> 21:25.993
<i>-Shh.</i>

21:26.035 --> 21:28.204
<i>Fremulon.</i>
