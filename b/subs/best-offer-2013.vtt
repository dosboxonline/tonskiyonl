00:48.430 --> 00:51.547
(man) Pinewood marriage chest
with groove joinery

00:51.722 --> 00:55.419
and hand-forged hinges
in the shape of tulip buds.

00:57.514 --> 00:59.172
Walnut sideboard.

00:59.347 --> 01:01.670
16th-century French decorations

01:01.847 --> 01:04.760
of herms
and griffin-shaped cartouches.

01:04.930 --> 01:08.011
Embellished deplorably
in the 19th century.

01:10.305 --> 01:13.920
A pair of oak veneer cabinets
in the Flemish style.

01:14.097 --> 01:15.755
Upper section with two doors,

01:15.930 --> 01:19.213
featuring carved anthropomorphic
figures and caryatids.

01:26.097 --> 01:27.803
Something wrong, Mr. Oldman?

01:48.430 --> 01:49.709
Is it important?

01:50.014 --> 01:52.881
lf you were kind enough
to let me have this as a gift,

01:53.055 --> 01:55.046
I'd be delighted to accept.

01:55.389 --> 01:57.214
I don't remember that.

01:57.389 --> 01:59.344
It may look like mouldy wood,

01:59.514 --> 02:01.634
but centuries ago,
beneath the mould,

02:01.972 --> 02:04.128
there must have been a painting.

02:55.889 --> 02:58.673
- Good evening. How are you?
- Very well.

04:04.555 --> 04:06.676
The management
and staff of Styrorex

04:06.847 --> 04:09.466
would like to offer our best wishes,
Mr. Oldman.

04:09.805 --> 04:11.961
Happy birthday, Mr. Oldman.

04:12.139 --> 04:14.971
This year, our chefs wish
to dedicate in your honour

04:15.305 --> 04:17.675
an ancient recipe
of a Renaissance dessert

04:17.846 --> 04:20.300
made of choux cream
and bitter almonds.

04:24.889 --> 04:26.085
Enjoy.

04:31.555 --> 04:34.968
- (woman) Most likely a rash.
- (woman 2) lt must be that.

04:53.014 --> 04:55.088
Was it not to your taste,
Mr. Oldman?

04:55.264 --> 04:58.878
Quite the contrary, but you see,
my birthday is tomorrow.

04:59.055 --> 05:03.263
It is now 10:35pm
and I'm very superstitious.

05:03.597 --> 05:05.054
Pretend I had accepted.

05:08.514 --> 05:10.303
The day after tomorrow, then.

05:13.055 --> 05:16.421
The director of the Vatican Museum
wants you to call him back.

05:16.597 --> 05:19.299
The reliquary attributed to Cellini,
I presume.

05:19.639 --> 05:21.215
The report on this is ready.

05:21.389 --> 05:24.091
There's a pile of gifts.
What shall I do with them?

05:24.264 --> 05:26.503
Send them to my house
except the mobile.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.718
- Only one this year.
- (phone rings)

05:28.889 --> 05:30.714
Good. Word's out that I hate them.

05:30.889 --> 05:34.336
Unless you've changed your habits,
you'll have to answer that.

05:34.514 --> 05:36.551
It's the first call on your birthday.

05:37.722 --> 05:38.883
Tradition.

05:42.555 --> 05:43.585
Hello.

05:43.764 --> 05:46.050
(woman) I have no wish
to waste your time.

05:46.389 --> 05:48.877
- Who's speaking?
- It's me, Claire Ibbetson.

05:49.055 --> 05:50.678
Please don't hang up on me.

05:50.847 --> 05:53.631
You're Mr. Oldman's secretary,
aren't you?

05:53.805 --> 05:56.376
You can speak to me.
It makes no difference.

05:56.722 --> 05:59.803
You see, I... I don't know anybody.
I'm on my own.

05:59.972 --> 06:02.674
I'm sorry, Miss lbbetson,
this is not a helpline.

06:02.847 --> 06:04.884
I'm not explaining myself very well.

06:05.055 --> 06:07.626
I'm not in the habit
of speaking to people much.

06:07.972 --> 06:10.507
That's a considerable stroke
of good fortune.

06:10.680 --> 06:13.382
- Talking to people is perilous.
- I'm desperate...

06:13.555 --> 06:15.960
You made the call
so you're running the risk.

06:16.139 --> 06:18.674
It's about the furniture
of my parents' villa.

06:18.847 --> 06:21.880
They... about a year ago.

06:22.055 --> 06:24.176
- You see?
- I understand.

06:24.514 --> 06:25.757
An estate of great...

06:25.930 --> 06:28.466
I've always heard it referred to
as being of...

06:28.639 --> 06:30.012
Extremely valuable.

06:30.180 --> 06:32.847
Very rare pieces,
including paintings.

06:33.180 --> 06:35.716
Unfortunately,
I have no photographs.

06:35.889 --> 06:37.050
So what?

06:37.222 --> 06:40.753
To be honest, I haven't decided yet,
but I would like to have a...

06:40.930 --> 06:43.300
Oh, I'm out of my depth.
What's the word?

06:43.472 --> 06:45.509
- Valuation.
- Exactly.

06:45.680 --> 06:49.046
That is why I asked
to speak to Mr. Oldman.

06:49.389 --> 06:52.340
Does Mr. Oldman have the pleasure
of knowing you?

06:52.514 --> 06:55.216
Oh, no, not at all.
He doesn't know me.

06:55.389 --> 06:57.260
But... but I know a lot about him.

06:58.472 --> 07:01.754
Mr. Oldman's assistants
are responsible for assessments.

07:01.930 --> 07:05.758
- I'll put you through.
- Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

07:05.930 --> 07:08.051
I must speak
to Mr. Oldman in person.

07:08.222 --> 07:11.220
Mr. Oldman never presides
over early appraisals.

07:11.555 --> 07:13.345
But you see, before he died,

07:13.514 --> 07:16.132
Dad told me that
if I decided to sell everything,

07:16.305 --> 07:19.303
I should entrust the auction sale
to Mr. Virgil Oldman.

07:19.472 --> 07:23.003
- In his opinion, the best.
- Sold!

07:23.180 --> 07:27.304
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me
great pleasure to present lot 231,

07:27.639 --> 07:32.710
a refracting elongated telescope
constructed by Galileo Galilei.

07:33.055 --> 07:35.093
It's still in perfect working order.

07:35.430 --> 07:37.835
Can we open bidding,
please, at 1,000,000?

07:38.180 --> 07:41.261
- 1,100,000.
- 1,100,000. 1,200,000.

07:41.555 --> 07:45.134
1,300,000.
1,400,000 on the telephone.

07:45.430 --> 07:48.097
1,500,000 back in the room.
1,600,000.

07:48.389 --> 07:51.256
1,700,000.
1,800,000 in the room.

07:51.555 --> 07:55.798
1,900,000. 2,000,000.
At 2,000,000.

07:56.097 --> 07:57.590
- (sneezing)
- Gesundheit. Was that a bid?

07:57.889 --> 08:02.510
(laughter)
At 2,000,000. 2,100,000.

08:02.805 --> 08:04.961
2,300,000 on the telephone.

08:05.264 --> 08:07.799
2,500,000. I can sell it. 2,700,000.

08:08.097 --> 08:11.427
At 2,700,000.
Any more? Are we all done?

08:11.722 --> 08:13.511
At 2,700,000.

08:14.597 --> 08:16.255
Sold. Congratulations, sir.

08:16.555 --> 08:18.427
Lot 232.

08:18.597 --> 08:22.460
Disciple of Boris Gregorian, Thurst.
Oil on canvas, 60 x 70.

08:22.764 --> 08:24.635
This one will go to the best offer.

08:25.805 --> 08:28.720
1,000. 2,000.

08:29.889 --> 08:33.751
3,000. 4,000. 5,000 online.

08:34.804 --> 08:38.052
6,000. 7,000.

08:38.347 --> 08:41.712
8,000. 9,000 on the telephone.

08:42.014 --> 08:44.467
10,000 back in the room.
11,000 online.

08:44.764 --> 08:48.176
12,000. 13,000 online.
14,000. 15,000.

08:48.347 --> 08:51.547
- This is not doing my neck any good.
- (laughter)

08:51.847 --> 08:53.589
At 15,000.

08:55.680 --> 08:57.967
20,000. At 20,000.

08:58.139 --> 08:59.797
Any more? Sold!

09:06.430 --> 09:09.926
(thunder rumbles)

09:54.805 --> 09:58.218
(thunder cracks, rain falls)

10:13.430 --> 10:17.755
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes. Very.

10:18.055 --> 10:20.804
You never miss a trick,
do you, governor?

10:24.347 --> 10:26.338
- Who is it really?
- Yansky.

10:26.639 --> 10:29.092
A Russian painter
who died in the late '30s.

10:29.389 --> 10:31.344
An outstanding landscape painter.

10:32.722 --> 10:36.301
But among his many landscapes,
he painted three portraits.

10:37.347 --> 10:39.172
Only three in his whole life.

10:40.305 --> 10:41.846
And this is one of the three.

10:44.847 --> 10:46.553
It's double, alright?

10:47.764 --> 10:49.589
How long have
we known each other?

10:49.889 --> 10:50.967
Quite a while.

10:51.264 --> 10:54.711
We've pulled off some sharp tricks
time after time.

10:55.014 --> 10:56.506
Remember Milo Hensen?

10:56.680 --> 10:59.761
You were the only one who knew
he was going to be big.

10:59.930 --> 11:02.466
We got that portrait of his mother
for a song

11:02.764 --> 11:06.094
from under the noses
of that bunch of idiots.

11:06.389 --> 11:07.763
Must be worth a fortune now.

11:07.930 --> 11:10.335
You almost sound bitter
you didn't get more.

11:10.639 --> 11:13.209
Have we ever talked about money,
you and me?

11:13.389 --> 11:15.924
- Honestly, no.
- It's been good enough for you.

11:16.097 --> 11:18.336
It's been good enough for me,
you misery.

11:18.514 --> 11:20.670
What matters is that you're satisfied.

11:20.972 --> 11:24.089
My only regret is never being able
to persuade you

11:24.389 --> 11:27.635
that my paintings are evidence
of a great artistic talent.

11:27.930 --> 11:30.501
A love of art
and knowing how to hold a brush

11:30.805 --> 11:32.179
doesn't make an artist.

11:32.347 --> 11:35.547
You need an inner mystery.
A knack you've never possessed.

11:35.847 --> 11:38.964
You're right. Double wasn't enough.

12:26.638 --> 12:29.635
(choral music)

13:55.638 --> 13:58.386
(Virgil, angrily)
In my 36 years in this business,

13:58.554 --> 14:02.169
never has anyone had the gall
to keep me waiting 40 minutes.

14:02.346 --> 14:05.013
It's a disgrace.
A display of bad manners.

14:05.179 --> 14:07.419
(Claire) Let me explain.
I tried to call.

14:07.596 --> 14:09.670
- There's no excuse.
- I tried to call.

14:09.846 --> 14:11.635
Never come near me again.

14:11.804 --> 14:14.672
Nobody answered and
I don't have your mobile number.

14:14.846 --> 14:16.920
I do not possess a mobile phone.

14:23.554 --> 14:24.584
(knock at door)

14:24.888 --> 14:27.376
lt's the lbbetson woman
on the phone.

14:27.679 --> 14:30.381
- Tell her to go to hell.
- She's crying.

14:30.679 --> 14:32.006
Serves her right.

14:32.179 --> 14:34.335
She was hit by a car
on her way to meet you.

14:34.513 --> 14:37.380
So much the worse for her.
It's no concern of mine.

14:37.679 --> 14:39.089
She was left unconscious.

14:39.263 --> 14:42.463
She was lying in a pool of blood
when the ambulance arrived.

14:43.846 --> 14:46.169
Alright. Put her through.

14:50.679 --> 14:52.469
(telephone rings)

14:52.638 --> 14:55.043
- Yes?
- (Claire, crying) Please forgive me.

14:55.346 --> 14:59.754
I had no intention
to be in any way disrespectful.

14:59.929 --> 15:01.884
Nothing too serious, I hope.

15:02.054 --> 15:05.420
No. Fortunately,
they'II... they'll let me out tomorrow.

15:05.596 --> 15:08.713
Good.
I hope you make a speedy recovery.

15:08.888 --> 15:10.925
Would you consent
to a new appointment?

15:12.054 --> 15:15.005
- Please. (weeps)
- Alright.

15:15.179 --> 15:17.170
But I'm sending an assistant.

15:17.346 --> 15:20.344
I hope it's the same one
I spoke to last time.

15:23.096 --> 15:24.257
What do you mean?

15:24.429 --> 15:27.593
Well, I can't explain it,
but I understood from the outset

15:27.763 --> 15:31.258
that voice could only
have been yours, Mr. Oldman.

15:31.554 --> 15:34.090
(woman) Truly surprising,
wouldn't you say?

15:34.263 --> 15:37.047
We think we'll be able
to bring out the whole face,

15:37.221 --> 15:40.302
part of her dress
and the left side of the background.

15:40.596 --> 15:43.796
(woman) Incredible. But what made
Mr. Oldman think that?

15:44.096 --> 15:46.715
- What period is it from?
- Too soon to say.

15:46.888 --> 15:49.423
Perhaps Mr. Oldman
will be able to work this out

15:49.596 --> 15:51.717
more quickly and better than us.

15:53.638 --> 15:56.091
- It's a fake.
- How is that possible?

15:56.388 --> 15:58.544
- It's beautiful!
- I didn't say it wasn't.

15:58.721 --> 16:00.214
I said it wasn't authentic.

16:00.388 --> 16:02.757
From an analysis
of the pigments and wood,

16:03.054 --> 16:04.961
we thought it was pre-17th century.

16:05.138 --> 16:07.673
- Even older.
- Then it must be worth something.

16:07.846 --> 16:12.384
It is a work by Valiante,
the female forger of the 16th century.

16:12.679 --> 16:14.006
She copied masterpieces,

16:14.179 --> 16:16.632
but couldn't sign them
as she was a woman,

16:16.929 --> 16:19.050
so she marked them
with a personal code

16:19.346 --> 16:21.088
hidden in the folds of the drapery

16:21.388 --> 16:23.674
or in this case,
in the gaze of the subject.

16:23.971 --> 16:27.088
The beam of light on the iris
is nothing if not a V.

16:27.263 --> 16:28.720
That is Valiante.

16:28.888 --> 16:33.461
It is worth something,
but nothing compared to the original.

16:55.263 --> 16:58.379
- Are you Mr. Oldman's assistant?
- Yes.

16:58.679 --> 17:00.966
I'm Fred, the caretaker.
Pleased to meet you.

17:02.846 --> 17:05.512
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

17:06.387 --> 17:07.417
And Miss lbbetson?

17:08.721 --> 17:09.964
She sends her apologies,

17:10.137 --> 17:12.708
but overnight,
she was running a temperature.

17:12.887 --> 17:16.502
She should have called me.
Spared myself a wasted trip.

17:16.804 --> 17:18.510
Well, give her my best wishes.

17:18.679 --> 17:21.346
She asked if you would go ahead
with valuation.

17:21.512 --> 17:23.669
She's instructed me
to show you around.

17:23.846 --> 17:27.425
Everything's at your disposal.
Come with me.

17:31.929 --> 17:34.548
Miss lbbetson was hoping
to meet your boss.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.802
It doesn't matter.
Your mistress didn't show up either.

17:37.971 --> 17:39.132
Fair enough.

17:39.304 --> 17:41.591
I suppose
it'll get the job done quicker.

17:41.888 --> 17:44.174
(laughs)

17:48.013 --> 17:49.422
Forgive the mess.

17:50.554 --> 17:54.465
It's gone to wrack and ruin ever since
Miss lbbetson's parents died.

17:56.554 --> 17:57.798
Let's go up.

17:59.763 --> 18:01.634
How long since the owners died?

18:01.804 --> 18:04.553
By the look of it,
you'd think it was centuries ago,

18:04.721 --> 18:06.344
but it's only been one year.

18:06.638 --> 18:10.334
First Mrs. Ibbetson and then,
scarcely 45 days later,

18:10.513 --> 18:11.756
poor Mr. Ibbetson.

18:11.929 --> 18:14.596
You have a good look.
Take your time.

18:14.763 --> 18:16.718
Just getting these curtains open.

18:18.304 --> 18:20.129
Too many windows in this room.

18:25.888 --> 18:26.966
Okay.

18:31.263 --> 18:34.130
How many brothers and sisters
does Miss lbbetson have?

18:34.304 --> 18:35.845
None. She is an only child.

18:36.138 --> 18:37.879
- Is she married?
- No.

18:38.054 --> 18:40.673
- Has she ever been?
- No, no.

18:40.846 --> 18:43.050
I don't think
she even has a boyfriend.

18:43.221 --> 18:46.551
- Grandparents, aunts, uncles?
- No, none at all.

18:46.846 --> 18:49.595
As far as I know,
Miss lbbetson is on her own.

18:53.721 --> 18:54.751
So many rooms.

18:55.971 --> 18:58.542
You know, I've never managed
to count them all.

19:14.346 --> 19:16.799
Have there been other valuations
before me?

19:16.971 --> 19:19.506
Absolutely none. Yours is the first.

19:19.804 --> 19:22.636
Miss lbbetson is extremely fond
of this house.

19:22.804 --> 19:24.463
Maybe too fond.

19:24.638 --> 19:27.552
She'd prefer to keep everything,
but what can you do?

19:27.846 --> 19:30.678
The empire crumbles.
A woman on her own can't cope.

19:31.971 --> 19:35.052
Is she thinking of putting
the house up for sale as well?

19:35.221 --> 19:37.840
That, I don't know. Maybe a part of it.

19:38.138 --> 19:40.045
She won't get rid of the whole place.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.088
What kind of work does she do?

19:42.388 --> 19:45.670
I couldn't say.
I only dealt with her parents.

19:48.638 --> 19:50.924
- May I see the cellars?
- It's this way.

19:52.221 --> 19:53.761
It's a long way down.

19:59.138 --> 20:00.299
Go ahead.

20:43.888 --> 20:45.084
I honestly don't get it.

20:45.388 --> 20:48.469
In the time I've known you,
I've never seen you beaten.

20:48.763 --> 20:51.677
I've watched you produce
all manner of gadgets

20:51.846 --> 20:53.801
from most unremarkable ironwork.

20:54.096 --> 20:56.715
Optical, arithmetical devices,
water clocks...

20:57.013 --> 21:01.302
Even that hairdryer that probably
dried the locks of Jules Verne's wife.

21:01.596 --> 21:04.843
But you've nothing to say
about this curious contraption?

21:05.138 --> 21:07.886
I'm surprised that
an art connoisseur like yourself

21:08.054 --> 21:10.886
can get so carried away
by a banal piece of ironwork.

21:11.054 --> 21:13.721
It's not the object
that arouses my curiosity,

21:13.888 --> 21:15.261
but it's contradiction.

21:15.554 --> 21:18.505
- Contradiction?
- Look.

21:18.679 --> 21:22.092
I found it in this position
in contact with damp flooring,

21:22.388 --> 21:26.298
but the rust is all along the top
of the cogs, nowhere near the damp.

21:26.596 --> 21:27.709
What does this mean?

21:28.013 --> 21:30.466
The object hadn't been there
for very long.

21:30.763 --> 21:34.591
It got rusted in some other place.
Or someone turned it upside down.

21:34.763 --> 21:38.093
That's all, nothing more than
a useless exercise in deduction.

21:38.346 --> 21:39.922
Hi. Did you manage it?

21:40.096 --> 21:41.375
Did you ever doubt me?

21:41.721 --> 21:44.256
This works perfectly now.

21:45.054 --> 21:47.922
And I transcribed
the recording from the tape.

21:48.096 --> 21:50.133
You're a genius.
How much do I owe you?

21:50.304 --> 21:51.678
Oh, nothing.

21:52.013 --> 21:53.719
Maybe you'll invite me out.

21:53.888 --> 21:54.966
Count on it.

21:55.304 --> 21:57.875
- Can I give you a kiss?
- Yes, you can!

21:58.221 --> 21:59.382
That I am good at.

21:59.721 --> 22:01.546
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

22:01.888 --> 22:05.335
William-Adolphe Bouguereau.
The Birth Of Venus.

22:08.304 --> 22:09.334
Authentic.

22:12.721 --> 22:16.418
Umberto Veruda,
The Honest, 1890.

22:34.846 --> 22:37.630
(Claire) You've been
the talk of the town lately.

22:37.971 --> 22:39.629
I hoped to see you
on TV.

22:39.804 --> 22:42.636
I don't like to appear.
I prefer to remain in shadow.

22:42.804 --> 22:44.380
We're much the same that way.

22:44.554 --> 22:46.260
That doesn't mean we'll agree.

22:46.429 --> 22:48.503
My secretary's been looking for you.

22:48.679 --> 22:51.677
How do you know that a painter
will become collectable?

22:51.846 --> 22:55.460
Intuition, which also makes
me doubt your intentions.

22:55.638 --> 22:59.678
Sorry for that impression but I've
entrusted you with my belongings.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.173
That's not how it works.

23:01.346 --> 23:04.297
There must be a signed contract
before the inventory.

23:04.471 --> 23:07.173
It takes time,
and unless you stop fooling around

23:07.346 --> 23:10.048
and decide to come out
it will never get started.

23:10.221 --> 23:12.295
Go ahead with the inventory.

23:12.471 --> 23:13.928
I'll meet you at the villa.

23:14.096 --> 23:15.719
We'll reach an agreement.

23:15.888 --> 23:17.297
You have my word.

23:17.638 --> 23:19.711
- (man) Take these.
- (man 2) Yes.

23:19.888 --> 23:20.966
Be careful!

23:21.138 --> 23:23.258
I'm not sure
but it looks German to me.

23:23.429 --> 23:25.918
Austrian. Careful with that.

23:26.096 --> 23:28.300
It's 11:00
The appointment was 8:30.

23:28.471 --> 23:32.132
She's not answering.
She said she'll come. She'll be here.

23:32.471 --> 23:34.675
The piano doesn't need restoration.

23:34.846 --> 23:35.876
Quite so.

23:36.054 --> 23:38.092
We have to check it
but there's no key.

23:38.263 --> 23:39.506
But here it is.

23:39.679 --> 23:41.551
Last time there was no key.

23:41.721 --> 23:42.799
Looks good.

23:43.138 --> 23:44.963
(worker) Mr Oldman!

23:45.138 --> 23:47.093
Would you help me
with the bookcase?

23:47.429 --> 23:50.214
Italian bookcase, wood. First half
of...

23:50.388 --> 23:51.418
Who smashed this?

23:51.596 --> 23:53.919
Nobody, Mr Oldman,
it was already broken.

23:54.096 --> 23:56.051
Is this part of the house inhabited?

23:56.221 --> 23:57.418
Why?

23:57.596 --> 23:59.503
There have been some changes.

23:59.846 --> 24:01.043
No, no, Mr...

24:01.221 --> 24:03.295
I'm sorry, I'm not sure of your name.

24:03.471 --> 24:04.750
I thought you were...

24:05.096 --> 24:06.553
It doesn't matter who I am.

24:06.888 --> 24:08.261
Nobody lives here.

24:08.596 --> 24:11.961
Be that as it may, if your mistress
is not here by midday

24:12.138 --> 24:14.970
I will have no option but to
suspend operations.

24:20.138 --> 24:21.216
(Fred) Mr Oldman!

24:26.054 --> 24:27.168
Miss lbbetson.

24:27.513 --> 24:29.384
(Claire)
Hello, Mr Oldman?

24:29.554 --> 24:32.007
Mr Oldman, can you hear me?

24:32.179 --> 24:35.794
Mr Oldman, I apologise.
What must you think of me?

24:35.971 --> 24:38.755
Spare me
the self-serving justifications.

24:38.929 --> 24:39.959
Let me speak.

24:40.138 --> 24:43.503
I cannot touch your things
without a contract. Is that clear?

24:43.679 --> 24:46.547
Would you leave it on the table
in the hallway?

24:46.721 --> 24:49.209
I'll sign it.
I accept all your conditions.

24:49.388 --> 24:51.094
Yes, but I do not accept yours.

24:51.263 --> 24:54.675
I will not do business
with a silly, superficial phantom.

24:54.846 --> 24:55.924
(crash)

24:56.263 --> 24:57.755
(Fred shouts) Be careful!

24:57.929 --> 25:00.133
I understand your exasperation.

25:00.304 --> 25:03.089
But please believe me
I didn't mean anything by it.

25:03.263 --> 25:07.505
It's been a series of unfortunate,
unintentional mishaps.

25:07.846 --> 25:10.002
So what exactly happened today?

25:10.179 --> 25:14.255
My car was stolen and I had to go
to the police to report it.

25:15.013 --> 25:17.501
Which police station did you go to?

25:17.679 --> 25:19.670
The one in the city.
- Whereabouts?

25:20.013 --> 25:22.631
- On the main square.
- Which square?

25:22.929 --> 25:25.133
(echoing)
No more interrogation!

25:25.304 --> 25:27.627
No more!
Who do you think you are?

25:27.971 --> 25:30.092
(crash echoes around room)

25:32.763 --> 25:34.469
Are you here, Miss lbbetson?

25:34.638 --> 25:36.877
What kind of question is that?

25:37.054 --> 25:38.251
Are you here?

25:38.429 --> 25:40.752
I don't understand.
I don't understand.

25:40.929 --> 25:43.133
- lf you're here, come out now.
- Stop it!

25:43.304 --> 25:46.586
Explain the meaning of this game
which I do not find amusing.

25:46.763 --> 25:48.800
Call me tonight. I'll explain.

25:48.971 --> 25:50.345
(hangs up phone)

25:52.179 --> 25:54.086
(Robert) lt's the same material

25:54.263 --> 25:56.052
and the same workmanship too.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.259
These belong to the same system.

25:58.596 --> 26:01.167
There's no signature,
no inscription?

26:01.513 --> 26:07.094
I mean when I've got the rust and
the oxidisation off the other piece.

26:08.513 --> 26:09.543
There's nothing.

26:09.888 --> 26:14.841
I can do the same with these but, I
mean, right now I can't see anything.

26:15.013 --> 26:16.754
(whistles)

26:18.596 --> 26:20.503
What have you found?

26:20.846 --> 26:24.046
The technique, how the cog
has been attached to it's axis.

26:24.221 --> 26:26.792
It's really old.
I've never seen it before.

26:26.971 --> 26:29.092
Here, look. Have a look.

26:36.846 --> 26:39.132
It's 18th century.

26:39.471 --> 26:41.461
We could be onto
something big here.

26:41.638 --> 26:43.509
Could you guess what it is?

26:44.971 --> 26:48.004
Three pieces of the mosaic
is not enough, Mr Oldman.

26:49.888 --> 26:52.506
In the last few years
the old couple were unwell.

26:52.679 --> 26:54.966
The house was in
a terrible state then.

26:56.221 --> 26:59.752
Mr lbbetson always said
that they'd have to sell something.

27:00.096 --> 27:02.051
And Miss Claire. How old is she?

27:03.888 --> 27:05.510
About 27.

27:06.888 --> 27:09.293
What else can you tell me
about her?

27:09.471 --> 27:10.798
Nothing really.

27:11.138 --> 27:14.384
I've never had much to do with her.
I don't really know her.

27:14.721 --> 27:18.880
And yet you've been in the service
of the lbbetsons for about 10 years.

27:21.138 --> 27:23.840
(Fred) Well, 11 years to be exact.

27:24.221 --> 27:26.128
I don't have much to do with her.

27:26.471 --> 27:28.757
I talk to her often
at all hours but...

27:29.096 --> 27:30.470
But?

27:30.804 --> 27:32.842
I've never seen her.

27:33.221 --> 27:36.717
- How could that be?
- It's the truth. Not once.

27:37.054 --> 27:38.595
Why?

27:40.638 --> 27:45.378
Because Miss Claire
suffers from a very strange illness.

27:46.554 --> 27:49.422
- (Claire) Hello.
- Good evening. It's Oldman.

27:49.596 --> 27:51.053
I was expecting your call.

27:51.221 --> 27:54.800
I have no wish to quarrel
and I'm sorry if I was rude today.

27:54.971 --> 27:56.049
It doesn't matter.

27:56.221 --> 27:59.089
But if I confirm I am available,
at the same time

27:59.263 --> 28:02.710
I cannot permit this joke in poor taste
to continue any longer.

28:03.054 --> 28:05.673
I wish you to stop
all involvement in my affairs.

28:05.846 --> 28:07.552
I apologise for the trouble.

28:07.721 --> 28:09.676
Send me your bill.
Good night.

28:09.846 --> 28:11.090
(hangs up)

28:17.721 --> 28:20.091
(Virgil) Lot 93. Valiante.
Portrait of a Lady.

28:20.263 --> 28:21.293
16th century,

28:21.471 --> 28:24.967
inspired by the Portrait of
a Young Girl by Petrus Christus.

28:25.138 --> 28:26.251
Oil on wood. 30 x 40.

28:26.596 --> 28:29.001
I have here an opening
bid of £20,000.

28:29.346 --> 28:31.881
- (man) £22,000.
- £22,000.

28:32.054 --> 28:35.005
£24,000. £26,000 on the telephone.

28:35.179 --> 28:38.343
£28,000 in the room. £30,000.

28:38.679 --> 28:40.469
£35,000. Thank you, sir.

28:41.263 --> 28:44.545
£40,000 on the telephone.
£45,000 in the room.

28:44.721 --> 28:46.048
£50,000.

28:46.388 --> 28:50.879
£55,000. £60,000.
£65,000 on the telephone.

28:51.221 --> 28:53.840
£70,000. At £70,000.

28:54.013 --> 28:58.136
Any advance on £70,000? £75,000.

28:58.471 --> 29:00.508
£80,000 on the telephone.
Any more?

29:00.679 --> 29:02.551
All done at £80,000.

29:02.888 --> 29:04.546
All done at £80,000.

29:05.804 --> 29:08.589
£90,000. Any more?

29:09.638 --> 29:10.881
Sold.

29:12.221 --> 29:14.792
- Thank you, sir.
- (woman) I bid £90,000 too.

29:15.138 --> 29:18.089
Mr Oldman should have been
aware of that.

29:18.429 --> 29:21.960
I don't believe so, Mrs Derain.
Mr Whistler bid £90,000.

29:22.304 --> 29:25.586
- He was the only one.
- (man) They bid simultaneously.

29:25.763 --> 29:28.168
(woman) She got her bid in first.
I saw it.

29:28.513 --> 29:29.886
What should we do?

29:30.054 --> 29:34.427
I'm the biggest collector of Valiante
forgeries and I'll sue you!

29:34.763 --> 29:38.342
You were too slow, Billy! You didn't
get in with your bid in time.

29:38.679 --> 29:40.385
And you were too late. Too late.

29:40.554 --> 29:42.841
You didn't keep up with me
for God's sake!

29:43.179 --> 29:46.011
She was behind me.
If I'd seen I'd have bid again.

29:46.346 --> 29:48.218
You're losing it!

29:48.388 --> 29:49.501
Maybe you're right

29:49.679 --> 29:52.298
but it's not the first time
we've messed up.

29:52.638 --> 29:56.133
It's the way things go. Never went
into a rage like this before.

29:57.929 --> 29:59.719
That wasn't a Valiante forgery.

30:00.054 --> 30:02.507
It was the genuine one
by Petrus Christus.

30:03.346 --> 30:05.799
It'll be worth £8 million.

30:07.971 --> 30:09.629
Woe be me.

30:11.346 --> 30:13.218
I'm sorry. Honestly.

30:14.804 --> 30:17.885
But even when we lost
Van Gogh's Lady With The Fan

30:18.054 --> 30:19.879
you didn't take it this hard.

30:20.721 --> 30:22.427
What's going on, Virgil?

30:26.429 --> 30:28.301
(woman) 642.

30:28.471 --> 30:30.011
729.

30:31.554 --> 30:33.924
918.

30:34.096 --> 30:36.335
1,011.

30:36.679 --> 30:40.009
1,119.

30:40.346 --> 30:42.669
1,320.

30:43.013 --> 30:45.252
1,404.

30:45.596 --> 30:47.800
- What will you have?
- (woman) 1,581.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.001
Tea, thank you.

30:52.513 --> 30:54.171
(woman) 8,109.

30:54.513 --> 30:56.468
8,725.

30:56.804 --> 30:59.885
(man) Sorry, darling, 8,625.

31:00.054 --> 31:02.625
(woman) 8,725!

31:03.013 --> 31:05.086
8,725.

31:05.263 --> 31:07.300
(man 2) Take a closer look,
you moron.

31:07.638 --> 31:10.719
(man) Shit! You're right, 8,725.
Well done, girl!

31:10.888 --> 31:12.345
That's it?

31:24.263 --> 31:25.803
- (woman) Bye!
- (woman 2) Bye!

31:28.929 --> 31:31.797
(Robert) I gave them a clean
with this special fluid.

31:32.179 --> 31:34.846
And I have studied them
by the millimetre

31:35.013 --> 31:37.299
and look what's come up.

31:38.346 --> 31:39.376
Vaucanson.

31:40.929 --> 31:43.631
I can't believe it!
Jacques Vaucanson.

31:43.804 --> 31:45.960
18th century constructor
of automata.

31:46.304 --> 31:49.053
When I was a student
I did my thesis on him.

31:49.388 --> 31:51.213
That's incredible!

31:51.388 --> 31:54.551
One of his most famous androids
even managed to talk.

31:54.721 --> 31:57.968
Exactly.
People would pay to ask it questions.

31:58.138 --> 32:03.008
The android would move its head,
bow, and give its reply.

32:03.388 --> 32:05.259
I bet there was someone inside.

32:05.429 --> 32:06.886
You know, a dwarf maybe.

32:07.054 --> 32:10.751
Just like Edgar Allan Poe suspected
with Maelzel's Chess Player.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.133
More than likely.

32:13.304 --> 32:15.591
But the mystery
that nobody could explain

32:15.763 --> 32:18.595
was how Vaucanson's
automaton always got it right.

32:18.971 --> 32:22.253
Of course there was trickery
in making the automaton talk.

32:23.804 --> 32:25.463
Everything it said was true.

32:27.096 --> 32:28.838
You bring me all the pieces.

32:29.013 --> 32:33.089
I promise to put them back together
exactly how Vaucanson had them.

32:33.263 --> 32:34.506
I don't doubt it

32:34.679 --> 32:37.796
but I fear I've lost my chance
to get the missing pieces.

32:38.138 --> 32:40.756
They must be in the same place
you found these.

32:41.096 --> 32:43.335
And all I need is 80%
of the elements,

32:43.513 --> 32:46.380
and I can work out the rest
and rebuild it myself.

32:46.554 --> 32:48.461
- It's not that easy.
- (horn beeps)

32:50.054 --> 32:52.092
I'm sorry. That's my girlfriend.

32:53.346 --> 32:56.048
Hey, Sarah, this is Mr Virgil Oldman.

33:00.304 --> 33:01.927
Pleased to meet you, Sarah.

33:02.096 --> 33:05.129
It's a pleasure. Robert has told me
so much about you.

33:05.304 --> 33:08.302
Don't young people talk about
more exciting things?

33:08.638 --> 33:10.296
Why don't you eat with us?

33:10.471 --> 33:12.841
That's very kind.
Another time, thank you.

33:13.221 --> 33:15.674
Alright, we won't insist.
We'll promise.

33:16.013 --> 33:17.719
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

33:24.096 --> 33:27.508
Cancel New York and tell
the Alphasons to meet us here.

33:27.846 --> 33:29.504
We called the meeting.

33:29.888 --> 33:32.755
So we've changed our minds.
Is that a problem?

33:33.096 --> 33:34.293
Alright, Mr Oldman.

33:39.346 --> 33:41.052
Claire lbbetson phoned.

33:42.263 --> 33:43.542
What does she want now?

33:43.888 --> 33:45.795
She asked you to meet her
at 2:30.

33:46.138 --> 33:47.927
Meet her where?

33:48.263 --> 33:50.170
At the lbbetson villa.

33:50.346 --> 33:51.755
Where else?

34:48.013 --> 34:52.504
(Claire) I'm extremely grateful to you
for coming, Mr Oldman.

34:54.096 --> 34:56.217
How did you know it was me?

34:56.388 --> 34:58.592
Fred has a limp. You don't.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.303
Ah.

35:01.888 --> 35:04.755
To be honest I didn't expect
you'd want to speak to me.

35:06.096 --> 35:09.757
I know you can't stand my excuses.
If I were you, I wouldn't either.

35:09.929 --> 35:11.208
In fact, your beh...

35:11.388 --> 35:12.549
How should I put it?

35:12.721 --> 35:14.344
Speak frankly. Don't worry.

35:16.346 --> 35:18.632
I won't deny that your whimsical
little ways

35:18.804 --> 35:20.261
are getting a bit tiresome.

35:22.346 --> 35:23.886
I hope not too tiresome.

35:25.221 --> 35:29.428
But I wanted to say sorry
for... well, my behaviour.

35:30.471 --> 35:33.967
Typical of a "silly, superficial
woman", as you put it.

35:34.138 --> 35:36.886
Why do you systematically
avoid meeting me?

35:37.054 --> 35:39.175
Nothing personal, believe me.

35:39.346 --> 35:41.834
Why would you want to do
business with a person

35:42.179 --> 35:44.170
who arouses such aversion in you

35:44.346 --> 35:46.917
that you can't even look him
in the face?

35:47.388 --> 35:50.339
It's hard to explain. You won't
believe me anyway.

35:50.679 --> 35:55.052
If I didn't believe you, I wouldn't be
here playing hide and seek.

35:55.221 --> 35:56.678
I don't meet many people.

35:57.929 --> 36:00.085
It's been a long time now.

36:00.263 --> 36:03.260
I see nothing serious in that.

36:03.429 --> 36:04.626
Everyone has moments

36:04.804 --> 36:07.506
when they prefer solitude
to the multitudes.

36:07.679 --> 36:10.511
I haven't left this house
since I was 15.

36:11.346 --> 36:14.509
- I don't think I understand.
- You understand perfectly.

36:14.846 --> 36:16.255
This is my room.

36:16.429 --> 36:19.048
If there's somebody in the house
or in the villa,

36:19.221 --> 36:21.258
I lock myself up in here.

36:21.429 --> 36:25.126
I've always done that,
even when my parents were here.

36:25.304 --> 36:26.927
I hardly ever saw them.

36:27.096 --> 36:28.293
I don't see anybody.

36:29.262 --> 36:30.341
But why?

36:30.513 --> 36:33.713
Why do you go around with
your hands covered by gloves?

36:33.888 --> 36:36.885
lt's a question of hygiene.
I don't see the connection.

36:37.054 --> 36:38.926
You're afraid to touch others.

36:39.096 --> 36:41.382
To touch their possessions
disgusts you.

36:41.721 --> 36:44.589
I'm afraid of going to places
where others live.

36:44.763 --> 36:47.547
These seem to me
very similar personal choices.

36:48.721 --> 36:52.418
You'd like me to believe you haven't
walked a street in 12 years?

36:52.762 --> 36:53.959
I see you know my age.

36:54.304 --> 36:58.215
Being a hermit and employing
a caretaker doesn't add up.

36:58.554 --> 37:01.836
I walk about quite a bit,
if that's what you want to know,

37:02.013 --> 37:05.129
inside the villa
when there's nobody here,

37:05.304 --> 37:08.255
which is often now,
but I never go out.

37:09.429 --> 37:11.585
The very idea paralyses me.

37:14.263 --> 37:16.300
I hope you understand me now.

37:16.637 --> 37:19.920
I hope that, within the limits
of your work, you'll help me.

37:21.263 --> 37:23.218
You have my word, Miss lbbetson.

37:23.387 --> 37:26.800
As to any agreement between us,
I leave it to you to set your fee.

37:26.971 --> 37:28.250
I trust you blindly.

37:31.679 --> 37:33.551
Leave the contract on the table.

37:33.887 --> 37:35.713
You'll find it signed next time.

37:35.887 --> 37:37.464
Now, please, I'm very tired.

37:50.263 --> 37:52.549
Apart from your fondness
for my gloves,

37:52.888 --> 37:54.925
what made you decide
to call me again?

37:55.096 --> 37:56.423
I haven't been kind.

37:57.554 --> 38:00.967
I was taken by the way you
were looking at my house yesterday

38:01.138 --> 38:02.547
from the bar opposite.

38:06.388 --> 38:08.343
You found the missing pieces.

38:08.513 --> 38:12.127
In the meantime
make do with this one.

38:12.304 --> 38:14.378
How much would the
automaton be worth

38:14.554 --> 38:16.841
if we manage to make it work?

38:17.013 --> 38:18.920
Think of a really, really high figure.

38:21.096 --> 38:23.549
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

38:23.763 --> 38:25.967
You've probably pitched it
too low.

38:26.304 --> 38:29.053
You're good at talking
without saying anything.

38:29.388 --> 38:31.508
I'll take that as a compliment.

38:32.137 --> 38:34.460
Should things go
the way I trust they will,

38:34.638 --> 38:36.675
you'll be very handsomely rewarded.

38:37.013 --> 38:40.958
I didn't mean to talk about money.
It's a real privilege for me.

38:41.138 --> 38:42.714
Where did you find these?

38:43.054 --> 38:46.254
There are very precise rules
in the world of antiques.

38:46.429 --> 38:48.716
It's forbidden to reveal
one's sources.

38:57.388 --> 39:00.302
There's a few more gears
but bigger in that corner.

39:00.471 --> 39:04.002
Gather them together. I'll take
care of the cataloguing myself.

39:04.179 --> 39:05.209
Of course.

39:06.346 --> 39:07.543
Candlesticks.

39:07.721 --> 39:10.470
- Which period?
- 17th-century. Repair.

39:12.388 --> 39:13.466
(Fred) Mr Oldman.

39:19.304 --> 39:20.583
(Claire) Mr Oldman.

39:21.763 --> 39:22.924
Yes.

39:23.096 --> 39:26.094
What have you decided
about the furniture in this wing?

39:26.263 --> 39:28.336
We're only drawing up
the inventory.

39:28.513 --> 39:30.633
Later you can tell me
what to leave out.

39:30.804 --> 39:31.882
Thank you.

39:34.013 --> 39:38.089
Listen, Miss lbbetson, I can't help
thinking about your situation.

39:38.263 --> 39:40.668
I'm sorry to have
intruded on your thoughts.

39:40.846 --> 39:42.422
That's not the point.

39:42.596 --> 39:45.215
I've been wondering how you
can live like this.

39:45.388 --> 39:47.461
I'm organised and self-sufficient,

39:47.638 --> 39:50.470
I don't need any help
but I appreciate your concern.

39:50.638 --> 39:51.965
You're welcome.

39:54.763 --> 39:57.298
- See you soon, then.
- Have a good day.

39:59.637 --> 40:00.799
Mr Oldman!

40:02.888 --> 40:04.261
Your contract.

40:20.179 --> 40:22.004
I read it and it seems fine to me.

40:22.388 --> 40:24.876
I initialled every page
and signed the last.

40:25.054 --> 40:26.879
That's how it's done, isn't it?

40:27.054 --> 40:28.168
Perfect.

40:28.346 --> 40:30.632
But your personal details
are missing.

40:34.388 --> 40:35.880
Take them from my passport.

40:46.471 --> 40:48.461
But it expired quite some time ago.

40:48.637 --> 40:52.217
- Personal details never expire.
- That's true enough, I suppose.

40:52.388 --> 40:55.255
I was just a girl then
but it'll do for your purposes.

41:10.221 --> 41:13.089
I wanted to mention
that in certain critical cases

41:13.263 --> 41:16.011
my advice is to proceed
directly to restoration.

41:16.179 --> 41:17.376
You know best.

41:17.554 --> 41:20.303
It means the whole thing
will take a little longer.

41:20.471 --> 41:22.794
We can widen
the scope of the valuation.

41:23.138 --> 41:24.251
I understand.

41:39.388 --> 41:41.461
You dye your hair.
I never noticed.

41:41.804 --> 41:45.466
I'm disgusted by people
who don't trust their own hair!

41:45.638 --> 41:48.470
I don't trust people who think so
much of themselves

41:48.638 --> 41:50.463
that they won't come outside.

41:51.888 --> 41:55.833
Ah, sir, there'll be no more
caretaker service as from Monday.

41:56.013 --> 41:58.964
I'll just come in to bring
Miss lbbetson her shopping.

41:59.138 --> 42:02.254
- The matter is of no interest to me.
- These are the keys.

42:03.388 --> 42:07.464
- Why give them to me?
- It's what Miss lbbetson wanted.

42:07.638 --> 42:10.505
In case you needed access
for further inspection.

42:13.346 --> 42:15.420
When you come in, slam the door,

42:15.763 --> 42:18.216
otherwise she'll get scared
and panic.

42:30.638 --> 42:32.344
(Robert) I'm going off my head

42:32.513 --> 42:35.261
trying to work out the alignment
of these devices,

42:35.429 --> 42:38.131
trying to figure out
which one fitted into which.

42:38.304 --> 42:40.674
- That can't be easy.
- But not impossible.

42:42.179 --> 42:44.632
You know,
gearboxes are like people.

42:45.554 --> 42:47.758
If they've been together
long enough,

42:47.929 --> 42:50.418
eventually,
they take on each other's forms.

42:51.346 --> 42:55.671
So, you believe time can make
any kind of cohabitation possible?

42:55.846 --> 42:57.422
Yeah, well, absolutely.

42:57.763 --> 43:01.009
You've reminded me of a friend
who met a much younger girl.

43:01.179 --> 43:02.720
She had agoraphobia.

43:03.054 --> 43:05.210
Fear of open spaces
and distances?

43:05.554 --> 43:09.500
Exactly. She lived for years locked
up in an apartment on her own.

43:10.721 --> 43:15.010
Recently, she gave him the keys
to her house and ever since,

43:15.179 --> 43:17.335
he's been in a state of...

43:18.929 --> 43:20.303
...permanent anxiety.

43:23.096 --> 43:26.592
What did I tell you? Now
he'll be constantly worried about her.

43:26.929 --> 43:28.007
He'll be thinking,

43:28.179 --> 43:32.043
"What does she need, shampoo,
medicine, tights... yoghurt?"

43:32.388 --> 43:33.928
lt's beautiful, isn't it?

43:34.804 --> 43:36.297
I'm not so sure.

43:36.638 --> 43:38.427
Tell your friend to stay calm,

43:38.596 --> 43:41.428
'cause time is already
working on their gearboxes.

43:50.471 --> 43:52.592
And there you are, Mr. Oldman.

43:57.054 --> 43:59.839
- (Claire) Are you angry with me?
- Why should I be?

44:00.013 --> 44:02.583
- What I said about your hair.
- Not at all.

44:03.638 --> 44:04.965
I was just calling to ask

44:05.138 --> 44:09.297
if you wish the sale of the furniture
to be identified by your family name.

44:09.471 --> 44:11.343
Or do you prefer anonymity?

44:11.513 --> 44:14.048
- Anonymity, anonymity.
- Good.

44:15.179 --> 44:17.004
This time, I did see you.

44:17.179 --> 44:18.672
- Oh?
- On TV.

44:18.846 --> 44:21.844
I don't generally give interviews
but I was forced to.

44:22.013 --> 44:23.838
You're more intriguing this way.

44:24.013 --> 44:26.679
You'll be a great success
with the ladies.

44:27.013 --> 44:29.050
(Virgil) So, we go to Lot 132.

44:29.221 --> 44:31.756
Gustave Rett,
Portrait of a Woman With a Hat.

44:32.096 --> 44:37.168
1956. Oil on canvas. 80 x 100 cm.

44:37.346 --> 44:39.716
This one goes to the best offer.

44:40.054 --> 44:41.677
£10,000.

44:42.012 --> 44:43.920
(ringing tone)

44:51.513 --> 44:54.960
Fred, any news from Miss lbbetson?
She hasn't answered in days.

44:55.138 --> 44:57.377
It's a while
since I heard from her.

44:57.554 --> 44:59.379
I've been in bed all week, ill.

44:59.721 --> 45:01.510
Who's been bringing her food?

45:09.596 --> 45:10.875
Miss lbbetson?

45:17.596 --> 45:19.136
Miss lbbetson?

45:29.554 --> 45:31.592
Miss lbbetson? Answer me!

45:35.179 --> 45:37.383
- (Claire gasps)
- Claire?

45:39.096 --> 45:40.470
Claire, are you alright?

45:41.971 --> 45:43.760
(Claire shouts) Oh, no. Please!

45:43.929 --> 45:45.884
- No. It's me, Claire.
- Get out!

45:46.054 --> 45:47.926
- It's me, Mr. Oldman.
- Go away!

45:48.096 --> 45:50.382
- Listen to me, it's Mr. Oldman.
- Get out!

45:50.554 --> 45:53.090
There's nobody else here.
Calm down.

45:53.263 --> 45:55.300
What's wrong?
Tell me what happened.

45:56.554 --> 45:58.047
I wasn't well.

45:58.221 --> 46:00.258
I didn't know who to call.

46:00.429 --> 46:01.591
Nobody answered.

46:01.763 --> 46:04.085
(sobs) And then I fell.

46:04.262 --> 46:07.214
I fell and I hit my...

46:07.554 --> 46:09.260
- Open the door.
- (cries)

46:09.596 --> 46:11.136
You need to see a doctor.

46:11.471 --> 46:14.138
No, please! (yelps) Please!

46:14.471 --> 46:16.794
Please, no!

46:19.887 --> 46:22.092
Can you fix a broken auctioneer
as well?

46:22.429 --> 46:24.219
I wouldn't know where to begin.

46:24.554 --> 46:26.877
It's good to see you again,
Mr. Oldman.

46:27.054 --> 46:30.669
Is something wrong? You seem
more preoccupied than usual.

46:30.846 --> 46:32.801
Too many woodworms
and spider webs

46:32.971 --> 46:35.210
and too few masterpieces.

46:35.388 --> 46:36.928
Could we put it that way?

46:38.221 --> 46:40.792
- So, how's our toy coming along?
- Ah.

46:40.971 --> 46:44.052
Well, I've managed to put
some sections back together.

46:45.929 --> 46:49.626
But, I mean, there's just still
too many pieces missing.

46:50.763 --> 46:52.552
The entire exterior.

46:52.888 --> 46:55.720
We can't establish
what kind of character he is.

46:56.054 --> 46:58.543
Like my friend
and his girl in the tower.

46:58.888 --> 47:01.755
Yeah, maybe, although
we've never seen our android.

47:01.929 --> 47:04.085
We're still groping around
in the dark.

47:04.429 --> 47:05.803
So is he.

47:06.221 --> 47:08.460
He speaks to her
through a closed door.

47:08.804 --> 47:10.878
- Closed door?
- Yes.

47:11.054 --> 47:15.130
If anybody moves in the house,
she barricades herself in her room.

47:15.471 --> 47:19.630
- He's never seen her face?
- Not only him, no-one has.

47:19.804 --> 47:22.802
That's like when two young people
meet on the internet.

47:23.138 --> 47:26.254
They get to know each other,
then reveal themselves.

47:26.429 --> 47:28.135
She won't reveal herself.

47:28.471 --> 47:31.173
Maybe he hasn't
got a good strategy.

47:32.638 --> 47:36.217
So, it's more difficult for my friend
to succeed in his enterprise

47:36.388 --> 47:39.339
than for us to reconstruct
the Vaucanson automaton?

47:39.513 --> 47:43.341
Depends on the number of rusty
pieces you're able to bring me.

47:43.679 --> 47:45.053
Well...

47:46.263 --> 47:47.803
...here's one more.

47:49.804 --> 47:51.297
That's a mobile phone.

47:52.596 --> 47:53.626
This is brand new.

47:53.804 --> 47:57.086
I'm the one that's rusty
because I don't know how to use it.

47:57.429 --> 48:00.380
Could you teach me
before your girlfriend gets here?

48:11.513 --> 48:15.044
(mobile phone rings)

48:19.471 --> 48:21.959
- Hello.
- (Claire) Good evening, Mr. Oldman.

48:22.138 --> 48:24.507
It's Claire Ibbetson.
Am I disturbing you?

48:24.679 --> 48:26.634
- No, not at all, Miss lbbetson.

48:26.804 --> 48:30.300
I told you, from now on,
you can call me any time you like.

48:30.471 --> 48:32.011
I wanted to thank you for...

48:33.138 --> 48:34.714
...everything, really.

48:34.888 --> 48:38.300
No need. All that's important
is you're feeling better now.

48:38.471 --> 48:41.469
Yes, it was just a small cut
on the head. I'm much better.

48:41.638 --> 48:44.422
I wanted to tell you,
I looked over the inventory.

48:44.763 --> 48:47.002
Oh! What do you think?

48:48.263 --> 48:50.585
You've done a great job.
Really, you have.

48:51.804 --> 48:53.960
But I'm troubled
by so many doubts.

48:54.138 --> 48:57.834
I'm not sure if it's a good idea
to sell. What would you advise?

48:58.013 --> 49:00.797
I couldn't say. I don't know
what your plans are.

49:01.138 --> 49:03.708
Why did you decide
to sell in the first place?

49:03.888 --> 49:07.751
Out of necessity in order to start
life afresh or another reason?

49:08.096 --> 49:10.051
All of the above, I suppose.

49:10.221 --> 49:13.254
I'd even sell the house.
It's too big for me now.

49:13.429 --> 49:17.091
Sometimes, I feel as though
I were in a public square.

49:17.263 --> 49:19.300
I'd like something smaller.

49:19.471 --> 49:21.378
But the idea of having to leave here

49:21.554 --> 49:23.841
and go somewhere else
fills me with dread.

49:24.013 --> 49:25.635
How would I manage it?

49:25.804 --> 49:29.086
Wear blindfolds? Have myself
carried out while asleep?

49:29.263 --> 49:32.593
I'd get into a state and end up
putting everything off.

49:35.679 --> 49:38.630
You have all the time in the world
to make up your mind.

49:38.929 --> 49:41.880
- You think?
- Well, until the catalogue is printed.

49:42.221 --> 49:46.167
Don't torment yourself.
Think of yourself, your future.

49:46.346 --> 49:48.420
That's the biggest torment of all.

49:48.762 --> 49:50.919
When I think about it,
I can't even work.

49:51.096 --> 49:53.501
I didn't know you were working.

49:53.679 --> 49:58.004
I write. I write novels, stories,
things like that.

49:58.346 --> 50:00.467
I'd like to read them. I'll buy some.

50:00.804 --> 50:03.209
Luckily for us,
you'll never manage to.

50:03.554 --> 50:04.928
Why not?

50:05.096 --> 50:08.841
Because I write under a pseudonym
and I loathe what I write.

50:09.179 --> 50:12.177
Artists always loathe
what they make, Miss lbbetson.

50:12.346 --> 50:14.301
Yesterday, you called me Claire.

50:16.346 --> 50:19.297
I wasn't aware.
I was in a state of alarm.

50:19.471 --> 50:21.841
- Sorry.
- I'd like you to continue.

50:23.304 --> 50:27.298
"I'd like you to continue."
She said it to him, just like that.

50:27.471 --> 50:29.011
Well, what did he say?

50:29.179 --> 50:32.177
He was taken back but he went
along with what she wanted.

50:32.512 --> 50:33.970
What else could he do?

50:34.304 --> 50:37.385
I'd have asked her to do the same,
call me by my first name.

50:37.554 --> 50:39.047
That's not his style.

50:39.221 --> 50:42.172
Besides, I don't think my friend
intends to court her.

50:42.346 --> 50:44.751
Then he'll never get her out of there.

50:44.929 --> 50:48.093
(automaton) I don't
think my friend intends to court her.

50:48.263 --> 50:51.177
I don't think my friend
intends to court her.

50:51.346 --> 50:52.543
Horrible voice!

50:52.888 --> 50:56.134
I'd have thought he'd at least
have desired to see her face.

50:56.304 --> 50:59.136
'Desired's probably
not the right word.

50:59.304 --> 51:03.215
Curious to see her, perhaps.
Yes, I could understand that.

51:03.388 --> 51:06.469
But the chances of it happening
seem to be really remote.

51:06.638 --> 51:07.965
There might be a way.

51:08.304 --> 51:10.627
Just depends on how brave
your friend is.

51:11.929 --> 51:14.418
- (Virgil) The French bureau.
- (Claire) Yes.

51:14.596 --> 51:18.459
- The table with the roll top.
- No, I'd like to keep that.

51:18.804 --> 51:21.553
That's it.
Next time, we'll do the paintings.

51:21.888 --> 51:23.795
- OK.
- One last thing, Claire.

51:23.971 --> 51:27.834
You'll have to decide whether we do
the photography here or in a studio.

51:28.179 --> 51:31.130
In a studio. I don't want
many people around the house.

51:31.471 --> 51:34.138
That's the best solution.
Well, I'm off now.

51:34.304 --> 51:37.219
- Anything you need?
- No. Thank you, Mr. Oldman.

51:38.554 --> 51:40.426
When will we next see each other?

51:41.763 --> 51:46.420
You mean, when do you see me?
Since I am not given that privilege.

51:47.721 --> 51:49.842
- Forgive me.
- But soon.

51:50.929 --> 51:53.085
- Have a good day.
- You too.

53:19.846 --> 53:22.417
(mobile phone rings)

53:29.679 --> 53:30.757
Hello?

53:56.138 --> 53:59.254
- I can't believe it.
- I couldn't sleep at night, Virgil.

53:59.429 --> 54:02.510
I had to do something to make
you forgive me.

54:02.679 --> 54:04.421
But how did you get it?

54:04.763 --> 54:07.844
I heard that Mrs. Durane
had fallen on hard times,

54:08.013 --> 54:12.717
so I persuaded her to sell it to me
for £250,000.

54:12.888 --> 54:15.092
Hmm, not exactly cheap!

54:15.263 --> 54:17.253
I thought it was a reasonable price.

54:17.596 --> 54:19.586
You were talking about £8 million.

54:19.763 --> 54:22.002
This way,
everyone gets a good deal.

54:23.471 --> 54:25.260
How much do you want, Billy?

54:25.429 --> 54:28.048
I don't want a penny more
than I gave the old girl.

54:28.221 --> 54:30.258
Now you're really losing your grip.

54:30.596 --> 54:32.752
I just want to get back
to where we were.

54:33.096 --> 54:35.845
How was your friend,
your accomplice,

54:36.179 --> 54:38.217
your trusted procurer of women?

54:39.804 --> 54:43.584
lf you're doing this to win back my
trust, it's been a bad deal for you.

54:45.263 --> 54:47.300
You never lost it in the first place.

54:47.638 --> 54:49.545
- Oh!
- (laughs)

54:51.054 --> 54:54.135
(Robert laughs) This is great.
This is great!

54:54.471 --> 54:56.213
You found important stuff.

54:56.388 --> 54:58.259
Best bit is this.

55:00.554 --> 55:03.422
- An ear.
- A step forward, wouldn't you say?

55:03.763 --> 55:06.216
I'd say!
I'd say we're at a turning point.

55:06.388 --> 55:07.631
Look.

55:13.763 --> 55:15.469
- Huh?
- Excellent.

55:15.804 --> 55:18.293
The pieces are attracting each other.

55:18.471 --> 55:19.501
So...

55:20.846 --> 55:24.093
How did things go with your... friend?

55:26.429 --> 55:30.423
How many seconds did it take you
to realise I was talking about myself?

55:30.596 --> 55:32.421
Quite a few, to be honest.

55:32.596 --> 55:35.215
Let me confess,
I didn't follow your advice.

55:36.304 --> 55:40.345
There was something too contorted
about it, too imprudent.

55:40.513 --> 55:42.089
Yeah, OK, I see your point.

55:58.054 --> 56:02.795
(ringing tone)

56:03.179 --> 56:07.255
(woman) The mathematical set
of a six-day week.

56:08.513 --> 56:13.502
The mathematical set
of a 51-minute hour.

56:14.888 --> 56:17.672
- What will you have, sir?
- Tea, please.

56:18.013 --> 56:19.968
Have you thought of anything else?

56:20.138 --> 56:22.756
The length of a point.
The direction of a circle.

56:22.929 --> 56:25.169
- (ringing tone)
- Your tea's ready, sir.

56:25.346 --> 56:29.091
The edge of a circumference.
The centre of space.

56:31.221 --> 56:35.546
- The area of a segment.
- Amazing. Well done!

56:36.679 --> 56:39.298
The vertical position of a sphere.

56:41.221 --> 56:43.970
I brought the furniture
and painting valuations.

56:44.138 --> 56:47.550
Look at them carefully because
you'll have to authorise them.

56:47.721 --> 56:51.667
- I don't know a thing about this.
- I know. Trust me, Miss lbbetson.

56:51.846 --> 56:54.678
You've been spending time
in the cellars recently.

56:54.846 --> 56:58.507
- Is that why you changed the locks?
- I change them every six months.

57:01.471 --> 57:04.255
And I take care to double-check,
compare and correct

57:04.596 --> 57:07.380
when dealing with
odds and ends in cellars.

57:07.554 --> 57:10.007
It's how I work.
If it upsets you, speak now.

57:10.388 --> 57:14.049
You'll find the new keys on the table.
Please take them.

57:18.471 --> 57:20.592
Thank you for your trust.

57:20.763 --> 57:22.919
Were you offended
at being locked out?

57:23.096 --> 57:24.293
No, but I was worried.

57:25.638 --> 57:28.719
You're right, I should have told you.
I'm sorry.

57:30.846 --> 57:34.425
Claire, you're ruining your life
for reasons which are beyond me.

57:34.763 --> 57:38.342
This illness of yours is so absurd,
it almost seems unreal.

57:40.013 --> 57:42.631
My mother thought
I was faking it the first time.

57:42.804 --> 57:44.178
We were abroad.

57:44.346 --> 57:47.344
I was so afraid of walking
at the foot of the Eiffel Tower

57:47.513 --> 57:48.922
that it paralysed me.

57:49.096 --> 57:52.047
I started screaming,
fell to the ground.

57:52.221 --> 57:55.421
I was just a little girl, but it kept
happening more and more

57:55.596 --> 57:57.136
and she had to believe me.

57:57.304 --> 57:59.094
Has there ever been an open space

57:59.263 --> 58:01.632
where you weren't overcome
by anxiety?

58:01.804 --> 58:06.545
Only one. During a school trip
to Prague. I was 14.

58:06.721 --> 58:09.007
The square
with the astronomical clock.

58:09.179 --> 58:13.173
I must have walked across it
a hundred times. It was beautiful.

58:13.513 --> 58:16.629
I remember a restaurant
with very strange decor.

58:17.846 --> 58:21.294
If there's one place in the world
I'm nostalgic for, it's that.

58:21.471 --> 58:22.928
I was really happy there.

58:24.346 --> 58:26.751
It was called Night and Day.

58:28.221 --> 58:31.172
- You've never been back?
- Never.

58:32.596 --> 58:36.376
Why not go now?
I'd be happy to take you.

58:41.513 --> 58:45.506
Well, you don't seem too pleased.
We're almost there.

58:46.721 --> 58:49.921
Our automaton is about
to emerge from the shadows.

58:50.096 --> 58:52.501
No, I'm delighted.
You're a force of nature.

58:54.804 --> 58:56.048
It's just that...

58:57.221 --> 58:59.010
...this is one of those evenings

58:59.179 --> 59:01.715
when one feels like this contraption
here...

59:07.763 --> 59:08.924
...incomplete.

59:10.179 --> 59:13.177
Why did you never marry?
You know, never have kids?

59:13.471 --> 59:14.964
The regard I have for women

59:15.138 --> 59:18.135
is equal to the fear
I've always had of them...

59:18.304 --> 59:20.793
...and to my failure
to understand them.

59:21.929 --> 59:24.133
If that's the rule, then Miss lbbetson

59:24.304 --> 59:27.752
gives every impression
of being the exception.

59:27.929 --> 59:29.091
I'm afraid so.

59:29.263 --> 59:31.965
Have you really never
set eyes on her?

59:32.137 --> 59:33.299
Just once.

59:34.346 --> 59:35.720
What's she like?

59:35.888 --> 59:39.549
I suppose feeling a certain interest
in a person

59:39.721 --> 59:43.300
necessarily engenders
a conviction that she's beautiful.

59:43.471 --> 59:45.129
Up to a point.

59:46.888 --> 59:50.549
It's her birthday in two days.
I'd like to get her something useful.

59:52.013 --> 59:54.964
I don't think useful
is probably your best approach.

59:55.304 --> 59:56.761
- No?
- Not the first time.

59:56.929 --> 59:59.927
It's better to get her something
more... traditional.

01:00:05.013 --> 01:00:06.209
Morning, sir.

01:00:08.638 --> 01:00:10.463
Hello, sir.

01:00:10.804 --> 01:00:13.672
Hey, Mr. Oldman.
Look what I found in the cellar.

01:00:14.929 --> 01:00:17.216
I saw you were interested
in this old junk.

01:00:18.596 --> 01:00:20.717
The supports for
the Murano chandelier.

01:00:21.054 --> 01:00:23.009
My colleagues couldn't find them.

01:00:23.179 --> 01:00:26.379
- I can put them in your car.
- That's very kind.

01:00:28.138 --> 01:00:29.381
Wait.

01:00:31.138 --> 01:00:32.299
Oh, thanks.

01:00:34.596 --> 01:00:35.793
Morning, Mr. Oldman.

01:00:37.346 --> 01:00:40.794
I took the liberty of remembering
it's your birthday.

01:00:41.263 --> 01:00:42.672
Happy birthday, Claire.

01:00:45.388 --> 01:00:48.385
(Claire) I read
the valuation documents.

01:00:48.554 --> 01:00:50.794
Did you manage to understand
some of it?

01:00:50.971 --> 01:00:53.008
Of course.
Ridiculous sums of money.

01:00:53.179 --> 01:00:56.177
Even a backwards child
would know she's being cheated.

01:00:56.346 --> 01:00:59.178
They need interpretation.
They're starting bids.

01:00:59.346 --> 01:01:02.427
- There'll be higher bids later.
- Suppose there aren't!

01:01:02.596 --> 01:01:05.345
Unlikely, but in that case,
we'll even things out.

01:01:05.513 --> 01:01:07.835
We'll raise the margins
on other pieces.

01:01:08.013 --> 01:01:10.631
A gamble? Where I'm the only one
that can lose?

01:01:10.804 --> 01:01:13.885
You're trying to cheat me.
It's all to your advantage.

01:01:14.054 --> 01:01:15.677
You're a fucking thief!

01:01:16.846 --> 01:01:19.595
I'm willing to resign
the commission forthwith.

01:01:20.804 --> 01:01:21.834
Huh!

01:01:23.679 --> 01:01:27.424
I'll have them replace all your
mediocre bric-a-brac immediately.

01:01:27.596 --> 01:01:30.215
And do me the favour
of disappearing completely

01:01:30.388 --> 01:01:31.845
from the face of the earth!

01:02:16.429 --> 01:02:17.970
1984, sir.

01:02:24.388 --> 01:02:26.343
(mobile phone rings)

01:02:34.971 --> 01:02:37.969
- Hello.
- (Claire) I behaved so badly.

01:02:42.054 --> 01:02:46.344
I feel so stupid. I constantly have
to offer justifications.

01:02:48.804 --> 01:02:51.340
I've never been given flowers
before.

01:02:51.513 --> 01:02:56.419
I don't know what this says to me.
(sobs)

01:02:58.221 --> 01:03:01.882
There's no need for this display
of anguish. I'm not angry with you.

01:03:03.596 --> 01:03:05.670
(Claire sobs)

01:03:05.846 --> 01:03:08.334
My birthdays have always been
so horrible.

01:03:10.179 --> 01:03:11.885
And you...

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:13.511
Since you came along...

01:03:14.721 --> 01:03:17.589
...you've turned my life upside down.

01:03:20.304 --> 01:03:23.053
The other day, I went downstairs.

01:03:24.304 --> 01:03:28.298
I opened the main door
and looked out onto the garden.

01:03:29.971 --> 01:03:32.424
- Did you go out?
- No.

01:03:34.304 --> 01:03:36.094
I was afraid.

01:03:36.263 --> 01:03:37.803
I felt terrible.

01:03:39.638 --> 01:03:41.758
But I never even got that far before.

01:03:45.804 --> 01:03:47.345
Do you want me to come over?

01:03:49.179 --> 01:03:50.885
I already know it's pointless.

01:03:51.054 --> 01:03:54.135
There are new treatments
nowadays. They might help you.

01:03:54.304 --> 01:03:56.591
I'd rather talk to you
than to some shrink.

01:03:58.054 --> 01:04:00.969
- Should I take that as a compliment?
- Yes.

01:04:04.638 --> 01:04:07.208
I see you brought up
the portrait of the dancer.

01:04:07.388 --> 01:04:10.136
- It's something I want to keep.
- No great value.

01:04:10.304 --> 01:04:13.255
(laughs) It's a portrait of my mother.

01:04:13.429 --> 01:04:15.633
She was about my age
when she had it done.

01:04:19.763 --> 01:04:21.172
Do you look like her?

01:04:21.346 --> 01:04:24.842
- She was prettier, I can assure you.
- I cannot judge.

01:04:34.388 --> 01:04:35.880
Alright, Claire. I'll go.

01:04:36.054 --> 01:04:39.254
Don't hesitate to call
if you need anything at all.

01:04:39.429 --> 01:04:41.503
Thank you, Mr. Oldman.
See you soon, I hope.

01:05:18.513 --> 01:05:20.053
(door slams)

01:05:23.971 --> 01:05:25.629
(phone rings)

01:05:29.471 --> 01:05:32.385
(Claire) Hello? Oh, it's you, director.

01:05:32.763 --> 01:05:35.251
No, I would've called you,
it's just that...

01:05:35.429 --> 01:05:38.261
...clearing the furniture
has been complicated.

01:05:39.721 --> 01:05:42.091
Yes. Oldman is dealing with it.

01:05:42.971 --> 01:05:46.751
What's he like?
Not as old as you might think.

01:05:47.138 --> 01:05:50.882
He dresses in an odd way,
but he's still a good-looking man.

01:05:51.263 --> 01:05:53.218
I know I can trust him.

01:05:53.388 --> 01:05:56.718
(laughs) Why? Are you jealous?

01:05:57.346 --> 01:06:00.178
In love? No, I don't think so.

01:06:00.388 --> 01:06:03.136
He's too put off by my illness,
like everybody.

01:06:03.304 --> 01:06:05.129
(loud crash, Claire exclaims)

01:06:05.304 --> 01:06:07.709
Oh no, it's nothing.
I... I hurt my foot.

01:06:08.054 --> 01:06:09.713
Can we talk later?

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:16.220
(groans)

01:06:35.346 --> 01:06:36.590
Who is it?

01:06:37.471 --> 01:06:39.011
Who's there?

01:06:40.013 --> 01:06:42.548
No, get out!
No, please, get out!

01:06:42.971 --> 01:06:45.257
(shouts) Go away! Get out!

01:06:45.638 --> 01:06:48.635
Get out! Please, leave me alone!

01:06:50.513 --> 01:06:52.053
(screams) Get out!

01:06:54.721 --> 01:06:56.261
(voice echoes) Get out!

01:07:02.888 --> 01:07:05.376
(phone rings)

01:07:11.429 --> 01:07:15.375
- Hello?
- (Claire) Please, help me, please.

01:07:15.638 --> 01:07:18.208
Calm down, Claire.
What's happened?

01:07:18.471 --> 01:07:21.173
You have to help me!
Help me!

01:07:21.429 --> 01:07:24.344
- I'll be there as soon as I can.
- Please.

01:07:28.388 --> 01:07:30.461
(breathes heavily)

01:08:07.679 --> 01:08:10.168
(pants)

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:21.470
Claire!

01:08:21.679 --> 01:08:25.625
- It's me. I'm here. What's happened?
- There's somebody in the house!

01:08:25.845 --> 01:08:28.879
- Please get them out!
- Calm down. There's nobody here.

01:08:29.054 --> 01:08:31.424
- There's someone in the house!
- Calm down.

01:08:31.763 --> 01:08:34.796
It was me before, Claire.
It was me.

01:08:36.386 --> 01:08:37.928
It was me.

01:08:40.679 --> 01:08:43.250
I hid in the room so I could see you.

01:08:45.761 --> 01:08:47.220
You were spying on me?

01:08:48.345 --> 01:08:50.420
(angrily) You were spying on me?

01:08:51.013 --> 01:08:52.470
(shouts) Get out!

01:08:52.638 --> 01:08:55.754
I want nothing more to do with you!
Get out!

01:09:04.334 --> 01:09:05.792
(door opens)

01:09:05.959 --> 01:09:08.448
(Claire) Please, Virgil. Don't go.

01:09:10.917 --> 01:09:12.992
(Claire sobs)

01:09:26.209 --> 01:09:29.326
Believe me,
I don't normally behave like this...

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:32.457
(Claire) Neither do I.

01:09:33.459 --> 01:09:36.576
So I'm bound to make some
mistakes...

01:09:39.042 --> 01:09:42.573
...but nothing in the world
would make me want to hurt you.

01:09:43.751 --> 01:09:47.033
It's just that I can't help myself.

01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:51.122
I need to see you.

01:10:27.668 --> 01:10:29.493
(Virgil) You should've seen her.

01:10:30.876 --> 01:10:33.660
Pale, like a Durer etching.

01:10:34.209 --> 01:10:37.540
She had the look of some creature
terrified of the universe.

01:10:37.876 --> 01:10:40.625
And I could read my own terror
in her eyes.

01:10:40.959 --> 01:10:45.498
Every man on earth would like to be
as terrified as you at this moment.

01:10:48.668 --> 01:10:50.208
(sighs)

01:10:53.626 --> 01:10:56.410
- You've worked a miracle.
- It's too soon to tell.

01:10:56.793 --> 01:11:00.454
And you be careful, alright?
This is when mistakes occur.

01:11:00.793 --> 01:11:02.748
When you think you've made it,

01:11:03.126 --> 01:11:04.916
that is when you lose strategy.

01:11:05.251 --> 01:11:09.197
- And what strategy would that be?
- Never stop surprising them.

01:11:09.376 --> 01:11:13.998
Do things they couldn't have
foreseen. Take a gamble, run a risk.

01:11:14.334 --> 01:11:17.167
You're asking me to behave
in a way that isn't me.

01:11:17.501 --> 01:11:19.575
That's why you have to do it.

01:11:20.376 --> 01:11:23.125
As long as you're playing
according to her rules,

01:11:23.293 --> 01:11:26.493
you're always gonna make her
feel like... like a patient.

01:11:26.668 --> 01:11:29.073
She needs to be treated
like a woman.

01:11:59.834 --> 01:12:01.908
What do you think? Do you like it?

01:12:05.751 --> 01:12:07.292
I don't know.

01:12:08.584 --> 01:12:10.125
What do you think?

01:12:11.126 --> 01:12:13.117
lt looks marvellous on you, Claire.

01:12:13.876 --> 01:12:15.499
Perhaps the smaller size?

01:12:16.376 --> 01:12:18.995
Yes. I think so too.

01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:35.542
It's been a long time
since I got a present like this.

01:12:37.168 --> 01:12:40.580
- Long overdue, don't you think?
- I don't know.

01:12:40.959 --> 01:12:43.708
(sighs) I'm a little,
you know, taken a back.

01:12:47.209 --> 01:12:49.283
(footsteps approach)

01:12:50.751 --> 01:12:52.789
- I'm sorry, I can't...
- What?

01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:55.906
Oh, certainly.

01:12:56.793 --> 01:12:59.707
I'm sorry.
I didn't understand.

01:13:08.293 --> 01:13:11.374
I don't honestly know
if I deserve all this.

01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:17.163
(Virgil) Let me be the judge of that.

01:13:35.668 --> 01:13:38.334
If we don't set a date
for the Stockholm auction,

01:13:38.501 --> 01:13:39.994
they'll shoot themselves.

01:13:40.168 --> 01:13:42.656
It's too far.
Let them shoot themselves.

01:13:45.418 --> 01:13:48.581
We have to schedule the meeting
with the Hermitage

01:13:48.918 --> 01:13:51.667
and the auctions in
San Francisco and Madrid.

01:13:51.834 --> 01:13:53.292
Ditto. Too far away.

01:13:53.584 --> 01:13:57.116
- We can't abandon them.
- There are auctioneers galore.

01:13:57.293 --> 01:14:00.207
They'll find someone else
and it will cost them less.

01:14:00.376 --> 01:14:01.655
As you wish.

01:14:07.043 --> 01:14:09.164
Lambert, are you married?

01:14:10.084 --> 01:14:12.538
Yes. Nearly 30 years.

01:14:12.876 --> 01:14:15.411
What's it like, living with a woman?

01:14:15.793 --> 01:14:17.665
Like taking part in an auction.

01:14:18.334 --> 01:14:21.498
You never know if yours
will be the best offer.

01:14:48.293 --> 01:14:49.869
- This one.
- Very well, sir.

01:14:51.626 --> 01:14:54.541
What do you think?
Have I made myself pretty?

01:14:56.334 --> 01:14:58.823
- Beautiful. You've done very well.
- Liar.

01:14:59.001 --> 01:15:01.371
- Claire.
- I haven't done this for years.

01:15:01.709 --> 01:15:04.707
I've forgotten how to do it.
I look like a monster.

01:15:04.876 --> 01:15:07.791
Trust me. Some practice
and you'll be wonderful.

01:15:07.959 --> 01:15:10.413
And you'll take me to
one of your auctions,

01:15:10.584 --> 01:15:12.492
and to galas with elegant people,

01:15:12.834 --> 01:15:16.282
and to the most refined restaurants
in the world.

01:15:16.626 --> 01:15:20.620
That's the reason for your
presents, isn't it, Virgil?

01:15:21.584 --> 01:15:24.831
To help me recover little by little,
and then take me out.

01:15:25.168 --> 01:15:26.957
Isn't that right?

01:15:29.376 --> 01:15:30.833
No!

01:15:31.001 --> 01:15:33.241
Claire. Don't be like this.
Let's talk.

01:15:33.543 --> 01:15:35.617
(loud rock music)

01:15:37.501 --> 01:15:41.744
Maybe we did get the last moves
wrong. I was a bit rash.

01:15:42.126 --> 01:15:43.619
Don't blame yourself.

01:15:43.793 --> 01:15:47.158
It's always her who manages
to pull everything apart.

01:15:47.501 --> 01:15:49.705
Robert. My aunt's gone missing
again.

01:15:49.876 --> 01:15:51.582
- You're kidding.
- Pardon me.

01:15:51.918 --> 01:15:55.034
- We found her in Central Park.
- I'm sorry, Terry.

01:15:55.209 --> 01:15:58.124
It was no good
trying to reset this thing.

01:15:58.293 --> 01:16:01.623
It was much more easy
just to make a new one.

01:16:01.793 --> 01:16:04.328
This one has a much wider range.

01:16:04.668 --> 01:16:06.991
She can go off
and you won't lose touch.

01:16:07.334 --> 01:16:09.870
Just make sure
you reprogram the PC, okay?

01:16:10.043 --> 01:16:12.199
I can manage that.
You're an angel.

01:16:13.126 --> 01:16:14.916
- Thanks, darling.
- No worries.

01:16:15.793 --> 01:16:18.625
- I'll see you tomorrow night, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:16:20.793 --> 01:16:25.995
You need an idea that'll excite her
but at the same time reassure her.

01:16:26.209 --> 01:16:30.783
Yes, but she'll still see through it
as some deceitful therapy.

01:16:31.084 --> 01:16:34.450
- You should invite her to dinner.
- Yes! Noma in Copenhagen!

01:16:34.793 --> 01:16:37.328
At the climax of the evening,
by candlelight,

01:16:37.668 --> 01:16:39.954
tell her that she's beautiful.

01:16:40.293 --> 01:16:42.414
And after
you'll have coffee with us?

01:16:42.751 --> 01:16:44.292
Why not?

01:16:46.209 --> 01:16:50.582
Joking apart, I'd be glad
if you did see her, hear her talk.

01:16:50.959 --> 01:16:53.792
I'm sure you'd understand
far more than I.

01:16:55.584 --> 01:16:57.622
Who said anything about joking?

01:16:59.168 --> 01:17:03.375
(Woman) 129,403.

01:17:03.543 --> 01:17:05.249
BARMAN: Your champagne.

01:17:05.876 --> 01:17:07.914
- Thank you.
- (man) Calculate this.

01:17:08.834 --> 01:17:14.831
(Woman) 12,624,831.333.

01:17:15.168 --> 01:17:17.075
- (door closes)
- (patron cheers)

01:17:17.251 --> 01:17:18.792
(man) Unbelievable!

01:17:24.334 --> 01:17:25.910
You're radiant, Claire.

01:17:27.959 --> 01:17:29.369
You did all this?

01:17:29.543 --> 01:17:32.245
I can turn my hand
to interior decorating.

01:17:41.209 --> 01:17:44.705
You've done a wonderful job, Virgil.
Thank you.

01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:54.241
I can't tell you how long I've wanted
to spend time alone with you.

01:17:54.584 --> 01:17:58.080
Somewhere quiet,
far from the madding crowd.

01:17:58.293 --> 01:18:00.367
(Claire giggles)

01:18:01.001 --> 01:18:02.542
(pours drink)

01:18:03.501 --> 01:18:05.575
(Virgil) To your serenity, Claire.

01:18:08.168 --> 01:18:09.874
To your irony, Virgil.

01:18:15.918 --> 01:18:18.288
- Now I feel I can finally tell you.
- What?

01:18:18.626 --> 01:18:21.161
You are more beautiful than the
dancer.

01:18:23.876 --> 01:18:25.369
VIRGIL: Dinner is served.

01:18:25.751 --> 01:18:28.240
- Please be seated.
- Thank you.

01:18:28.584 --> 01:18:30.954
I warn you, as a waiter
I'm not the best.

01:18:31.293 --> 01:18:33.663
I offer no guarantees.

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:37.493
- I'll take the risk.
- Somewhat foolhardy of you.

01:18:38.126 --> 01:18:41.159
- Why?
- lf the service is not to your liking,

01:18:41.334 --> 01:18:43.491
next time I'd have to
make a reservation

01:18:43.668 --> 01:18:45.291
at the best restaurant in town.

01:18:47.959 --> 01:18:50.080
Let's not ruin this evening, Virgil.

01:18:50.251 --> 01:18:53.699
- Please, let's not talk about me.
- Alright.

01:18:54.043 --> 01:18:56.709
Instead I'd like you to tell me
about your past.

01:18:57.084 --> 01:19:00.284
You see, there's nothing
very original about my life.

01:19:00.626 --> 01:19:03.743
A child loses his parents,
a horrible orphanage...

01:19:04.084 --> 01:19:07.497
The only point of interest is
that the nuns would punish the boy

01:19:07.668 --> 01:19:11.080
by making him work with a restorer
who had a workshop there.

01:19:11.418 --> 01:19:13.159
That's beautiful.

01:19:13.334 --> 01:19:15.539
He loved to observe
this craftsman,

01:19:15.876 --> 01:19:19.538
so the little boy got up to
all sorts of mischief

01:19:19.709 --> 01:19:22.624
to ensure he'd be punished
as often as possible.

01:19:22.793 --> 01:19:24.618
So he became acquainted with art,

01:19:24.959 --> 01:19:28.740
techniques of painting,
how to tell a forgery from an original

01:19:28.918 --> 01:19:30.707
etc., etc.

01:19:30.876 --> 01:19:35.866
(Claire) In an old article of yours
I found on the internet, you said,

01:19:36.209 --> 01:19:39.456
"There's something authentic
in every forgery."

01:19:39.793 --> 01:19:41.202
What did you mean?

01:19:41.376 --> 01:19:43.450
When simulating another's work

01:19:43.834 --> 01:19:47.745
the forger can't resist the temptation
to put in something of himself.

01:19:47.918 --> 01:19:51.034
Often it's just a trifle,
a detail of no interest.

01:19:51.376 --> 01:19:52.952
One unsuspected stroke,

01:19:53.126 --> 01:19:56.373
by which the forger inevitably
ends up betraying himself,

01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:59.992
and revealing his own,
utterly authentic sensibilities.

01:20:00.959 --> 01:20:03.199
I really love the way you talk.

01:20:03.543 --> 01:20:05.913
You couldn't have been
more convincing.

01:20:06.084 --> 01:20:07.874
Huh? A born seducer.

01:20:08.209 --> 01:20:12.250
- So you'd give me a pass?
- A+. With distinction!

01:20:12.584 --> 01:20:15.203
Sorry, you've been
a bit neglected lately.

01:20:17.001 --> 01:20:19.620
You haven't said
anything about Claire.

01:20:20.418 --> 01:20:24.079
If I didn't know about her problems,
I'd say she was normal.

01:20:24.459 --> 01:20:27.790
And she's much more beautiful
than you described.

01:20:28.126 --> 01:20:30.579
Really. I liked her.

01:20:30.751 --> 01:20:32.706
You're going to make me jealous?

01:20:32.876 --> 01:20:36.123
lf you want my advice,
you pray that girl never gets better.

01:20:36.459 --> 01:20:39.030
Do you want lots 87 and 88
done separately?

01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:41.579
No, together. That's important.

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:49.950
How can I help you?

01:20:51.668 --> 01:20:54.073
- It's about Robert.
- What's going on?

01:20:56.084 --> 01:20:57.458
Don't be afraid to tell me.

01:20:59.584 --> 01:21:02.417
We're not getting on so well,
that's the problem.

01:21:02.751 --> 01:21:05.121
All those girls hovering around him...

01:21:06.376 --> 01:21:07.917
I guess I'm just...

01:21:08.501 --> 01:21:10.124
...l'm afraid of losing him.

01:21:11.209 --> 01:21:13.081
Is there anything I can do?

01:21:14.418 --> 01:21:15.958
Do you want me to talk to him?

01:21:18.084 --> 01:21:22.208
For a while now he's been
talking about someone called Claire.

01:21:24.668 --> 01:21:26.208
Claire?

01:21:27.168 --> 01:21:29.040
I don't understand

01:21:29.209 --> 01:21:33.618
With him everybody's got to
be on their guard, all the time.

01:21:33.959 --> 01:21:35.701
That goes for you, too.

01:21:36.584 --> 01:21:38.291
(Sarah sobs)

01:21:38.626 --> 01:21:40.498
I feel so stupid.

01:21:43.793 --> 01:21:46.162
Promise me you won't say a word
to him.

01:21:47.251 --> 01:21:48.909
I promise.

01:21:54.043 --> 01:21:56.614
(Robert) Have you been
waiting long?

01:21:56.793 --> 01:21:59.542
lf you'd phoned,
I wouldn't have kept you waiting.

01:21:59.709 --> 01:22:02.376
- I prefer to see you.
- Is something wrong?

01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:04.617
My assistant will come by today.

01:22:04.793 --> 01:22:07.791
Kindly hand over the
Vaucanson as it is.

01:22:07.959 --> 01:22:10.033
Alright. Whatever you want.

01:22:10.376 --> 01:22:12.865
Tell him how much you're owed.
He'll pay you.

01:22:14.876 --> 01:22:16.914
Aren't I at least due an explanation?

01:22:17.084 --> 01:22:20.035
You're not the trustworthy man
I thought you were.

01:22:22.043 --> 01:22:25.408
(Claire) lt's weird seeing them so
perfect and polished up.

01:22:25.751 --> 01:22:27.208
It's as if they weren't mine.

01:22:38.418 --> 01:22:40.455
I believe nothing is missing.

01:22:41.626 --> 01:22:43.249
There is something missing.

01:23:03.793 --> 01:23:07.952
How could you have lived
the best years of your life in here?

01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:11.826
I don't know. I don't know.

01:23:12.543 --> 01:23:14.083
It was just the right thing.

01:23:17.626 --> 01:23:19.119
"Was."

01:23:20.918 --> 01:23:22.458
lt still is.

01:23:22.793 --> 01:23:24.333
It always will be.

01:23:25.084 --> 01:23:26.625
Always.

01:23:33.668 --> 01:23:37.365
You have to get out of here.
You have to do it by yourself.

01:23:38.376 --> 01:23:40.248
I don't have the courage.

01:23:42.418 --> 01:23:45.665
It's a spider's web that
I don't know how to break free of.

01:23:50.126 --> 01:23:52.531
It's an old collection
my father was fond of.

01:23:52.876 --> 01:23:54.997
I never did understand what it was.

01:23:55.918 --> 01:23:58.241
- (phone rings)
- (Claire sighs)

01:24:02.168 --> 01:24:04.870
(Claire) Hello?
Good morning, director.

01:24:05.959 --> 01:24:07.831
Yes, I'm nearly finished.

01:24:08.584 --> 01:24:11.073
But I would like to rewrite
the last chapter.

01:24:11.751 --> 01:24:13.825
A more upbeat ending.

01:24:15.918 --> 01:24:17.790
If that's all you want...

01:24:18.626 --> 01:24:21.541
Yes. Talk to you soon. Thanks.

01:24:22.376 --> 01:24:23.538
(Claire hangs up)

01:24:23.876 --> 01:24:27.242
I wouldn't rule out them
being part of something valuable,

01:24:27.418 --> 01:24:29.455
but exactly what I couldn't say.

01:24:29.793 --> 01:24:32.281
- I often wonder if...
- What?

01:24:32.584 --> 01:24:35.499
lf you're more interested
in my furniture than in me.

01:24:37.251 --> 01:24:39.325
How could you say that?

01:24:41.168 --> 01:24:44.082
I shouldn't have let you in here.
I shouldn't have.

01:25:07.626 --> 01:25:10.079
I've found all the missing pieces.

01:25:10.376 --> 01:25:12.663
How do you feel about
finishing the job?

01:25:13.543 --> 01:25:15.450
Well, it's your problem.

01:25:15.793 --> 01:25:17.451
(crackling of solder)

01:25:17.626 --> 01:25:19.664
Sarah came to see me
a few days ago.

01:25:19.834 --> 01:25:22.074
She was upset
about your relationship.

01:25:25.543 --> 01:25:29.951
- Are you here to advise me now?
- No, you're the expert on women.

01:25:31.293 --> 01:25:33.959
Alright.
We can pick up where we left off.

01:25:34.293 --> 01:25:35.454
On two conditions.

01:25:35.793 --> 01:25:39.454
You just stop involving me
in your private life.

01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:41.788
And the second?

01:25:47.626 --> 01:25:49.083
Is that you take this back.

01:25:54.501 --> 01:25:58.116
I didn't get excited about
your Vaucanson for the money.

01:26:01.584 --> 01:26:03.492
I brought it back. It's in the car.

01:26:03.834 --> 01:26:05.659
And the new pieces too?

01:26:06.001 --> 01:26:10.077
You'll have to be patient for those.
They're tied up with my private life.

01:26:10.418 --> 01:26:13.250
I don't know
and I don't want to know.

01:26:14.626 --> 01:26:18.750
If you were forced to choose
between Claire and the automaton,

01:26:19.084 --> 01:26:20.992
which would you take?

01:26:28.376 --> 01:26:31.742
- This one.
- An excellent choice, Mr. Oldman.

01:26:32.084 --> 01:26:33.411
If it's the wrong size,

01:26:33.584 --> 01:26:36.701
please inform the lady to pass by
whenever she wishes.

01:26:36.876 --> 01:26:38.582
Thank you, I'll let her know.

01:26:38.918 --> 01:26:40.624
Claire? lt's me.

01:26:55.959 --> 01:27:00.700
- (rock music playing)
- Claire! I've brought lunch.

01:27:10.334 --> 01:27:11.875
Claire!

01:27:13.501 --> 01:27:18.324
- (suspenseful music)
- Claire, answer me!

01:27:20.043 --> 01:27:21.583
Claire!

01:27:23.293 --> 01:27:24.833
Claire!

01:27:26.668 --> 01:27:28.208
Claire!

01:27:33.834 --> 01:27:35.410
Are you down here?

01:27:40.918 --> 01:27:43.620
(shouts) Claire!
(echoes)

01:28:19.334 --> 01:28:21.325
Have any of you seen a woman

01:28:21.501 --> 01:28:24.416
going out the gate
of the villa across the road?

01:28:24.584 --> 01:28:26.042
No, I can't say I have.

01:28:26.376 --> 01:28:29.409
Has anybody seen someone
coming out of the villa?

01:28:29.751 --> 01:28:32.500
A young woman.
Medium height, light hair.

01:28:32.834 --> 01:28:35.323
- A bit pale.
- I think I saw her.

01:28:35.668 --> 01:28:36.947
I didn't see her go out,

01:28:37.126 --> 01:28:39.330
but she was walking away
from the gate.

01:28:39.668 --> 01:28:41.954
- When?
- This morning at breakfast.

01:28:42.293 --> 01:28:45.456
- What else can you tell me?
- She seemed a bit weird.

01:28:45.793 --> 01:28:50.118
- Weird? Which way did she go?
- That way. Towards the park.

01:28:50.459 --> 01:28:52.201
231.

01:28:52.543 --> 01:28:55.790
- (tires screech, horn sounds)
- (driver, angrily) Idiot!

01:28:55.959 --> 01:28:57.784
(ring tone)

01:28:57.959 --> 01:29:00.164
- (Robert) Hello? Virgil?
- She's gone.

01:29:00.334 --> 01:29:02.953
- Who? What's going on?
- Claire's disappeared.

01:29:03.126 --> 01:29:05.994
I've looked.
They saw her leave this morning.

01:29:06.334 --> 01:29:08.657
- Do you want me to come over?
- Please.

01:29:11.543 --> 01:29:13.083
Has this happened before?

01:29:13.251 --> 01:29:15.407
She never even appeared
at the windows.

01:29:15.584 --> 01:29:17.125
Just behind the shutters.

01:29:17.459 --> 01:29:19.699
Did she have friends
she could go to?

01:29:20.043 --> 01:29:24.332
She'd talk to people on her
computer under different names.

01:29:24.668 --> 01:29:28.247
- She can't have gone far.
- Let's hope so.

01:29:28.584 --> 01:29:30.622
I've already been round three times.

01:29:30.793 --> 01:29:33.079
(phone rings)

01:29:33.251 --> 01:29:35.041
- Hello?
- (Lambert) Mr. Oldman.

01:29:35.209 --> 01:29:37.994
- Listen, has Miss lbbetson phoned?
- No.

01:29:38.168 --> 01:29:40.870
- lf she calls, let me know.
- I will.

01:29:41.043 --> 01:29:44.823
Mr. Oldman, I wouldn't like
to think you'd forgotten.

01:29:45.001 --> 01:29:46.873
Forgotten what?

01:29:47.209 --> 01:29:49.911
(crowd murmurs)

01:29:54.293 --> 01:29:57.705
- (man) There he is. Here we go.
- Lot number one.

01:29:58.043 --> 01:30:02.083
Late Baroque, Venetian,
mid-18th-century mirror.

01:30:02.251 --> 01:30:04.372
Inlaid wood with gold leaf,

01:30:04.709 --> 01:30:07.707
with adornments,
floral motifs and festoons.

01:30:08.043 --> 01:30:09.749
(speak indistinctly)

01:30:09.918 --> 01:30:11.458
Upper frame richly...

01:30:16.168 --> 01:30:18.040
(sighs)

01:30:19.709 --> 01:30:22.458
Inlaid wood with gold leaf,
with adornments,

01:30:22.626 --> 01:30:24.368
floral motifs and festoons.

01:30:24.543 --> 01:30:26.913
Upper frame richly
engraved with whirls.

01:30:27.084 --> 01:30:28.542
Can we say 130,000 euros?

01:30:29.668 --> 01:30:31.244
140,000 euros.

01:30:31.584 --> 01:30:33.907
150,000 euros.
Gentleman on my left.

01:30:34.084 --> 01:30:36.122
160,000 euros. Lady up the back.

01:30:36.501 --> 01:30:40.625
170,000 euros.
180,000 euros on the telephone.

01:30:40.959 --> 01:30:44.539
200,000 euros.
Gentleman on my left in the room.

01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:46.914
220,000 euros.

01:30:47.084 --> 01:30:50.201
250,000 euros on the tele...
(PHONE RINGS)

01:30:50.543 --> 01:30:53.576
(Fred) Still nothing, Mr. Oldman.
I'll keep looking.

01:30:53.751 --> 01:30:56.370
- Robert's looking further afield.
- Alright.

01:30:56.543 --> 01:30:59.327
- I'll call you later.
- Alright

01:31:01.709 --> 01:31:04.411
- He's gone crazy.
- 280,000.

01:31:04.751 --> 01:31:06.872
310,000. Any more?

01:31:07.751 --> 01:31:10.038
- Sold!
- (phone rings)

01:31:10.376 --> 01:31:14.240
(Robert) I'm doing the rounds
of the hospitals, but there's nothing.

01:31:14.418 --> 01:31:15.615
Just keep looking.

01:31:15.793 --> 01:31:18.411
- We'll find her. I'll keep in touch.
- Thanks.

01:31:19.459 --> 01:31:21.035
Lot number 2.

01:31:21.209 --> 01:31:24.124
A 17th-century
Fassadenschranke wardrobe

01:31:24.293 --> 01:31:26.118
in walnut, maple, oak and ash.

01:31:26.293 --> 01:31:28.959
The carved frame
surmounts an inlaid stripe,

01:31:29.293 --> 01:31:32.575
and two doors engraved
with architectural motifs,

01:31:32.918 --> 01:31:34.908
surrounded by carvings of fruit.

01:31:35.251 --> 01:31:38.368
Three spiralled,
tapered columns flank the doors.

01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:41.743
(crowd laughs)
The lower body has two drawers.

01:31:42.084 --> 01:31:43.542
(crowd laughs)

01:31:44.751 --> 01:31:45.948
And um...

01:31:50.501 --> 01:31:53.618
There's nothing for it
but to call the police.

01:31:53.793 --> 01:31:56.660
It'll be all over the papers.
They'll drag me into it.

01:31:56.834 --> 01:31:58.292
Let's wait a bit longer.

01:31:58.626 --> 01:32:00.202
What do you hope will happen?

01:32:00.543 --> 01:32:03.873
That she'll come back... or turn up.

01:32:05.209 --> 01:32:07.876
Or they'll find out where she is.

01:32:08.043 --> 01:32:11.788
Someone with her problems
doesn't just disappear into thin air.

01:32:11.959 --> 01:32:14.033
Well, that depends.

01:32:14.376 --> 01:32:16.248
No matter how deeply rooted it is,

01:32:16.418 --> 01:32:19.202
sometimes a phobia
can just disappear by itself.

01:32:19.543 --> 01:32:21.201
So, why did she run away?

01:32:21.376 --> 01:32:23.497
Maybe something happened
between you

01:32:23.834 --> 01:32:26.405
that drove her
to take that kind of decision.

01:32:26.584 --> 01:32:29.867
You know perfectly well
that's impossible.

01:32:30.043 --> 01:32:32.875
You're the only person
who knows everything

01:32:33.043 --> 01:32:34.749
that happened between us.

01:32:36.168 --> 01:32:38.123
(engine revs outside)

01:32:38.293 --> 01:32:40.532
Excuse me a minute.

01:32:40.709 --> 01:32:42.250
(door opens)

01:32:43.584 --> 01:32:45.125
(door closes)

01:32:46.793 --> 01:32:48.748
(indistinct arguing outside)

01:32:51.793 --> 01:32:53.700
(indistinct arguing)

01:32:57.501 --> 01:32:59.657
(phone rings)

01:33:00.001 --> 01:33:02.999
- Hello?
- (Lambert) I'm sorry, Mr. Oldman.

01:33:03.168 --> 01:33:05.573
I've called
all the publishers in existence

01:33:05.751 --> 01:33:07.789
but none of them knows
who she is.

01:33:07.959 --> 01:33:10.199
They said that often
even they don't know

01:33:10.376 --> 01:33:13.540
the identity of authors
who use pseudonyms.

01:33:13.876 --> 01:33:16.032
I'd never have guessed that you

01:33:16.209 --> 01:33:18.663
would have ended up
in a mess like this.

01:33:18.834 --> 01:33:22.615
- I don't know how I can help you.
- All you had to do was listen.

01:33:22.959 --> 01:33:25.116
Ah.

01:33:25.293 --> 01:33:29.749
Considering the lady's illness,
it seems highly unrealistic

01:33:30.084 --> 01:33:31.909
that she's just run away.

01:33:33.209 --> 01:33:37.618
I'd say, I don't know,
she'd been abducted or something.

01:33:37.959 --> 01:33:40.874
That's not likely.
I don't think she had any enemies.

01:33:41.209 --> 01:33:44.575
It could be somebody became
so besotted with her

01:33:44.751 --> 01:33:46.327
and carried her off by force.

01:33:46.668 --> 01:33:50.080
- But who?
- I've had my doubts about Robert.

01:33:50.418 --> 01:33:51.448
The young guy?

01:33:51.793 --> 01:33:54.791
The way you describe him,
he doesn't seem the type.

01:33:55.126 --> 01:33:58.290
From the literary point of view,
he fits the bill.

01:33:59.418 --> 01:34:01.455
The young knight
rescuing the damsel

01:34:01.626 --> 01:34:05.074
from the clutches of the old man
incapable of love.

01:34:05.418 --> 01:34:08.167
Literature, exactly.

01:34:08.501 --> 01:34:10.492
Don't go overboard, Virgil.

01:34:10.834 --> 01:34:14.117
She could have had her own reasons
for disappearing.

01:34:14.459 --> 01:34:16.948
I can't imagine what reasons.

01:34:17.293 --> 01:34:20.493
Recently, she's been experiencing
emotions and feelings

01:34:20.668 --> 01:34:22.954
that are incompatible with flight.

01:34:23.293 --> 01:34:25.283
I wouldn't be so sure,
if I were you.

01:34:25.626 --> 01:34:28.115
Human emotions
are like works of art.

01:34:28.459 --> 01:34:30.166
They can be forged.

01:34:30.334 --> 01:34:34.245
They seem just like the original,
but they're a forgery.

01:34:36.793 --> 01:34:40.739
- Forgery?
- Everything can be faked, Virgil.

01:34:41.084 --> 01:34:44.035
Joy, pain, hate.

01:34:45.584 --> 01:34:48.038
Illness, recovery.

01:34:49.584 --> 01:34:51.658
Even love.

01:35:06.793 --> 01:35:09.328
(phone rings)

01:35:09.501 --> 01:35:11.243
- Hello?
- (Robert) Listen.

01:35:11.418 --> 01:35:13.953
There's something
that hadn't occurred to us.

01:35:14.126 --> 01:35:18.167
Are you sure there are
no other secret rooms in the villa?

01:35:18.334 --> 01:35:20.455
FRED: I don't remember
any other doors

01:35:20.626 --> 01:35:22.830
like the one to Miss lbbetson's room.

01:35:24.251 --> 01:35:26.491
Claire!

01:35:26.668 --> 01:35:31.372
The only place we haven't looked at
is the attic... if you want?

01:35:37.334 --> 01:35:40.167
(Virgil) Did you know
that Miss Claire was a writer?

01:35:40.334 --> 01:35:42.905
(Fred) I heard her parents
talk about it.

01:35:43.084 --> 01:35:46.118
(Virgil) She used a pseudonym
for her books.

01:35:46.293 --> 01:35:50.203
(Fred) I never knew that.
I've never seen the books.

01:35:50.543 --> 01:35:52.284
She never wanted them here.

01:35:52.626 --> 01:35:54.000
(Virgil) Claire!

01:35:55.293 --> 01:35:58.575
(Fred) We're wasting time.
There are no other secret rooms.

01:35:58.751 --> 01:36:00.327
(Claire) You've come back.

01:36:00.501 --> 01:36:02.326
- (Fred) We should...
- Quiet!

01:36:02.668 --> 01:36:03.995
(Claire) You've...

01:36:05.168 --> 01:36:06.577
You've come back.

01:36:06.751 --> 01:36:08.623
You've...

01:36:10.668 --> 01:36:12.493
You've come back.

01:36:12.834 --> 01:36:14.208
You've...

01:36:14.376 --> 01:36:16.034
Claire?

01:36:21.376 --> 01:36:25.073
Claire, I can feel you're there.
Answer me.

01:36:27.543 --> 01:36:29.035
(Claire) You've come back.

01:36:31.876 --> 01:36:34.957
- You've come back.
- Of course I have.

01:36:36.293 --> 01:36:37.951
Were you afraid I wouldn't?

01:36:42.543 --> 01:36:44.415
(door opens)

01:36:49.918 --> 01:36:52.869
(Claire) I thought
you'd abandoned me.

01:36:53.043 --> 01:36:56.539
- Like last time.
- Last time?

01:36:56.876 --> 01:36:59.708
When we got back from Prague.

01:37:02.876 --> 01:37:04.203
Claire.

01:37:26.126 --> 01:37:28.200
I will never abandon you.

01:37:31.751 --> 01:37:35.282
(Claire) I'd been happy in Prague
in that very odd restaurant.

01:37:37.959 --> 01:37:40.874
I was there with my first
and only boyfriend.

01:37:43.043 --> 01:37:44.666
He was older than me.

01:37:49.543 --> 01:37:52.245
When we got back
from that excursion,

01:37:52.418 --> 01:37:55.332
one afternoon,
we were walking in the city centre.

01:37:58.168 --> 01:38:00.242
A car crashed into us.

01:38:01.418 --> 01:38:05.163
When I came to,
he wasn't there anymore.

01:38:24.626 --> 01:38:26.498
(water tinkles)

01:38:26.668 --> 01:38:31.041
I went back home
and I never went out again.

01:38:59.418 --> 01:39:01.574
(Virgil) I've never slept
with a woman.

01:39:01.918 --> 01:39:04.916
In fact, I didn't close my eyes.

01:39:05.251 --> 01:39:08.747
I spent the whole night
just looking at her.

01:39:09.084 --> 01:39:13.327
- It was wonderful.
- Well, welcome to the grown-up club.

01:39:13.668 --> 01:39:16.452
You've succeeded
in making her fall in love.

01:39:18.168 --> 01:39:20.040
I had a good teacher.

01:39:22.543 --> 01:39:24.699
I understood where the dwarf hid.

01:39:25.043 --> 01:39:27.910
Look, there must have been
a sunken pedestal here.

01:39:28.251 --> 01:39:29.874
He would crouch in there

01:39:30.043 --> 01:39:32.448
and his voice would reverberate
in the body.

01:39:32.626 --> 01:39:34.416
It must have made an impression.

01:39:34.751 --> 01:39:36.872
Do you think love can be faked?

01:39:39.584 --> 01:39:41.456
(scoffs)

01:39:41.626 --> 01:39:44.458
In keeping with what you say
about art forgeries,

01:39:44.793 --> 01:39:47.116
I'd say it can't be completely faked.

01:39:47.459 --> 01:39:49.497
If one could say love is a work of art.

01:39:49.834 --> 01:39:52.323
It'd be amazing if it were,
wouldn't it?

01:39:52.501 --> 01:39:54.373
lt could be sold off at an auction.

01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:58.371
The highest bidder could relive
the greatest love stories.

01:39:58.543 --> 01:40:01.031
I hope I haven't destroyed
your love story.

01:40:01.376 --> 01:40:03.283
No problem. No problem.

01:40:03.626 --> 01:40:06.031
A new valve, two hinges, one fuse...

01:40:06.209 --> 01:40:08.663
It'll be good as new.
Just like the first day.

01:40:09.001 --> 01:40:11.324
What do you think
you're going to do now?

01:40:13.293 --> 01:40:15.616
I want to coax her out.

01:40:15.959 --> 01:40:19.823
Yeah, I wouldn't push too hard
if I were you.

01:40:20.168 --> 01:40:22.242
She's too fragile.

01:40:22.584 --> 01:40:26.957
You'll see. When you least expect it,
things will fall into place naturally.

01:40:27.293 --> 01:40:30.990
- (rain pours)
- (car alarm beeps)

01:40:36.626 --> 01:40:40.667
- (fast footsteps approach)
- (Virgil grunts)

01:40:42.126 --> 01:40:46.036
(Virgil) No!
(car alarm sounds)

01:40:56.793 --> 01:40:58.333
(groans)

01:40:59.876 --> 01:41:03.407
(thunder rumbles)

01:41:16.543 --> 01:41:18.332
(thunder rumbles)

01:41:28.209 --> 01:41:30.283
- (groans)
- (ring tone)

01:41:34.334 --> 01:41:38.494
- (Claire) Hello? Hello?
- (Virgil mumbles indistinctly)

01:41:38.668 --> 01:41:41.500
Virgil? Virgil, is that you?

01:41:43.001 --> 01:41:45.075
(thunder rumbles)

01:42:13.876 --> 01:42:16.543
Virgil! Virgil!

01:42:22.709 --> 01:42:24.617
Virgil?

01:42:45.251 --> 01:42:47.041
Help! Help!

01:42:48.376 --> 01:42:50.911
- (nurse 1) Hold it up!
- (nurse 2) lt is up!

01:42:51.293 --> 01:42:53.959
(nurses speak indistinctly)

01:43:20.168 --> 01:43:22.917
(Claire) Why don't you love it?

01:43:23.084 --> 01:43:26.913
I've never felt it to be a real home.
More like a hotel.

01:43:27.251 --> 01:43:29.372
You come home a night,
sleep if you can.

01:43:29.543 --> 01:43:31.913
Next morning,
you're off somewhere else.

01:43:33.251 --> 01:43:35.325
Let's go back inside.

01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:40.490
Seems to have been planned
to welcome a lot of people.

01:43:40.668 --> 01:43:44.033
Yes, but the plan was never realised.

01:43:44.209 --> 01:43:46.876
Except for the inaugural reception.

01:43:47.209 --> 01:43:49.165
I was so distrustful of other people

01:43:49.334 --> 01:43:54.039
that I kept them away from
the perimeter of my personal hotel.

01:43:56.334 --> 01:43:58.206
I was a fool.

01:43:59.668 --> 01:44:01.244
Even now, I still get upset

01:44:01.418 --> 01:44:04.700
when I see the housekeeper
and the maids walking about.

01:44:04.876 --> 01:44:06.950
After dinner, I send them home.

01:44:08.501 --> 01:44:11.036
I wasn't wrong when I said
we were very similar.

01:44:11.209 --> 01:44:12.951
Yes, you were right.

01:44:14.626 --> 01:44:16.700
And thanks to you, I understood.

01:44:34.918 --> 01:44:37.536
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll soon find out.

01:44:39.751 --> 01:44:43.661
Close your eyes.
I'll tell you when you can open them.

01:44:47.084 --> 01:44:48.826
(electronic beep)

01:44:52.251 --> 01:44:55.000
Don't be afraid. I'll lead the way.

01:44:55.168 --> 01:44:58.450
I never liked games
where you had to close your eyes.

01:44:58.793 --> 01:45:01.495
(keypad beeps)

01:45:05.751 --> 01:45:09.282
- Mind the step.
- Gently, please.

01:45:13.501 --> 01:45:14.745
We're almost there.

01:45:16.376 --> 01:45:17.785
Stop now.

01:45:20.084 --> 01:45:21.791
Open your eyes.

01:45:29.626 --> 01:45:31.332
I don't believe it.

01:45:34.834 --> 01:45:36.327
It's overwhelming.

01:45:36.959 --> 01:45:39.282
I've been collecting them
all my life.

01:45:41.293 --> 01:45:44.374
So, I'm not the first.
You have had other women

01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:47.079
Yes.

01:45:47.251 --> 01:45:49.822
I've loved them all
and they loved me back.

01:45:50.168 --> 01:45:52.289
They taught me to wait for you.

01:45:54.126 --> 01:45:55.951
And now that you're here,

01:45:56.126 --> 01:45:58.330
we'd like you to come
and live with us

01:45:58.501 --> 01:46:00.954
and make this beautiful hotel
your home.

01:46:02.501 --> 01:46:04.042
Oh, Virgil.

01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:09.198
If anything should ever happen to us,

01:46:09.376 --> 01:46:11.450
I want you to know that I do love you.

01:46:13.668 --> 01:46:15.291
I love you too.

01:46:15.459 --> 01:46:19.121
The catalogue for the sale
of the paintings and furniture

01:46:19.293 --> 01:46:20.785
of lbbetson Villa is ready.

01:46:20.959 --> 01:46:24.407
Congratulations. It's a lovely volume.
(Robert) About time!

01:46:26.084 --> 01:46:29.118
I wonder who'll buy
this wonderful stuff... Oh, sorry.

01:46:29.293 --> 01:46:32.623
I can't conceal my anxiety to know
what you think about it.

01:46:43.459 --> 01:46:45.000
Well, don't you like it?

01:46:47.709 --> 01:46:49.083
No, it's just that...

01:46:51.084 --> 01:46:53.869
...ever since I decided
to come and live with you...

01:46:55.459 --> 01:46:59.156
...l've been thinking I... don't want
to sell anymore.

01:47:01.543 --> 01:47:03.913
I'd like to leave everything
the way it was.

01:47:10.751 --> 01:47:11.829
I understand.

01:47:12.876 --> 01:47:13.906
Are you sure?

01:47:14.751 --> 01:47:17.286
Believe me, if I were you,
I'd do the same thing.

01:47:19.459 --> 01:47:22.825
Tomorrow, everything
will be back in its place.

01:47:25.876 --> 01:47:27.038
Alright, Virgil!

01:47:31.751 --> 01:47:35.910
To the most tortured and most
fortunate catalogue of my career.

01:47:36.084 --> 01:47:37.743
That's saying something.

01:47:37.918 --> 01:47:39.955
- Here, here.
- Cheers.

01:47:41.543 --> 01:47:43.948
And since you've become
my family...

01:47:45.834 --> 01:47:48.536
...I too have an important
announcement to make.

01:47:49.376 --> 01:47:51.580
Next week,
I have an auction in London.

01:47:51.918 --> 01:47:55.283
It will be the finest of my career
and the very last.

01:47:58.209 --> 01:47:59.868
(indistinct chatter)

01:48:01.001 --> 01:48:03.833
They say he's been seen
recently in female company.

01:48:04.001 --> 01:48:05.743
- Who? Virgil?
- Yes.

01:48:05.918 --> 01:48:10.042
It's finally come home to him that the
worst sexual perversion is chastity.

01:48:11.251 --> 01:48:13.870
(Claire) How is it going
onstage for the last time?

01:48:14.043 --> 01:48:17.906
I've never felt better. There's
a whiff of anticipation in the air.

01:48:18.084 --> 01:48:20.371
All my colleagues
have come to see me off.

01:48:20.543 --> 01:48:21.917
That's nice of them.

01:48:22.084 --> 01:48:25.913
This affection is because they won't
have to put up with me anymore.

01:48:26.084 --> 01:48:28.075
(Claire laughs)

01:48:28.251 --> 01:48:31.498
Anyhow, I'm happy, Claire.
I just wish you were here.

01:48:31.668 --> 01:48:33.125
Me too.

01:48:33.293 --> 01:48:36.741
But I'm not ready to travel yet.
I got dizzy in the car yesterday.

01:48:36.918 --> 01:48:40.449
Don't let it get to you. We have
all the time in the world to travel.

01:48:40.626 --> 01:48:42.782
- We're ready, Mr. Oldman.
- I'm coming.

01:48:43.668 --> 01:48:45.872
Have you heard
from our young friends?

01:48:46.043 --> 01:48:48.827
Constantly.
I'm never left on my own.

01:48:49.001 --> 01:48:51.039
Good. Give them my love.

01:48:52.209 --> 01:48:54.876
- I can hear you've got to go.
- Yes.

01:48:55.959 --> 01:48:59.491
- But I can't wait to get back home.
- Good luck, my darling.

01:49:00.459 --> 01:49:02.913
£12,100,000.

01:49:06.084 --> 01:49:07.494
Any more?

01:49:09.376 --> 01:49:11.781
£12,300,000.

01:49:13.084 --> 01:49:14.625
Any advance?

01:49:17.626 --> 01:49:20.115
£12,500,000 on the telephone.

01:49:21.626 --> 01:49:23.617
Any more?

01:49:23.793 --> 01:49:26.411
All done at £12,500,000.

01:49:26.751 --> 01:49:30.247
Sold for £12,500,000.

01:49:31.584 --> 01:49:34.950
Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you.

01:49:47.293 --> 01:49:50.623
- Good to see you.
- Thank you. Not a bad price.

01:49:50.959 --> 01:49:53.116
Can I say hello to you in public?

01:49:53.293 --> 01:49:55.283
Oh, Billy.

01:49:55.626 --> 01:49:59.750
You were fantastic, my friend! I'm
happy for you. I'm going to miss you.

01:50:00.084 --> 01:50:02.289
You say it like
we'll never meet again.

01:50:02.709 --> 01:50:04.202
Of course we will.

01:50:04.376 --> 01:50:07.907
But I'm feeling nostalgic
thinking about all our exploits.

01:50:08.626 --> 01:50:10.533
- You'll get over it.
- Virgil?

01:50:11.668 --> 01:50:14.452
To remind you of
what a great artist I could've been

01:50:14.793 --> 01:50:18.656
if only you'd believed in me,
I've sent you one of my paintings.

01:50:18.834 --> 01:50:20.624
I promise I won't burn it.

01:50:30.918 --> 01:50:32.458
Claire.

01:50:34.001 --> 01:50:35.542
Claire, I'm back!

01:50:37.543 --> 01:50:39.083
Hello?

01:50:42.293 --> 01:50:45.160
- Have you seen Miss Claire?
- (housekeeper) No, sir.

01:50:45.543 --> 01:50:47.083
Claire?

01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:50.119
Where are you?

01:50:51.876 --> 01:50:53.038
Claire?

01:50:54.251 --> 01:50:57.035
(housekeeper) Mr. Oldman,
she must have gone out.

01:50:57.376 --> 01:50:58.833
It was the same yesterday.

01:50:59.001 --> 01:51:02.331
Sarah and Robert came to get her,
then came back for lunch.

01:51:02.501 --> 01:51:03.745
Alright.

01:51:24.418 --> 01:51:25.958
(electronic beep)

01:52:23.501 --> 01:52:26.285
- (string snaps)
- (music starts to play)

01:52:27.209 --> 01:52:29.117
(Robert's voice) "There is always

01:52:29.293 --> 01:52:32.326
"something authentic
concealed in every forgery."

01:52:32.501 --> 01:52:35.914
I couldn't agree more.
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

01:52:36.084 --> 01:52:38.289
"There is always something
authentic

01:52:38.459 --> 01:52:40.249
"concealed in every forgery."

01:52:40.418 --> 01:52:42.290
I couldn't agree more.

01:52:42.459 --> 01:52:45.078
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

01:52:45.251 --> 01:52:47.455
"There is always something
authentic

01:52:47.626 --> 01:52:49.368
"concealed in every forgery."

01:52:49.543 --> 01:52:51.415
I couldn't agree more.

01:52:51.584 --> 01:52:54.203
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

01:52:54.376 --> 01:52:56.497
"There is always something
authentic

01:52:56.668 --> 01:52:58.374
"concealed in every forgery."

01:52:58.709 --> 01:53:02.703
I couldn't agree more.
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

01:53:02.876 --> 01:53:05.032
"There is always something
authentic

01:53:05.209 --> 01:53:06.916
"concealed in every forgery."

01:53:07.084 --> 01:53:09.122
I couldn't agree more.

01:53:09.293 --> 01:53:11.330
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

01:53:11.501 --> 01:53:14.949
"There is always something
authentic concealed in every..."

01:53:31.459 --> 01:53:35.453
Good morning, Mr. Oldman.
We have visitors today.

01:53:35.626 --> 01:53:38.743
Isn't this nice?
Look who's come to see you!

01:53:46.293 --> 01:53:48.449
How are you, Mr. Oldman?

01:53:53.084 --> 01:53:54.826
I've brought your mail,

01:53:55.168 --> 01:53:58.450
some newspapers
and a few magazines.

01:54:16.793 --> 01:54:18.830
(tyres screech)

01:55:25.334 --> 01:55:29.198
A few days ago, they brought
some furniture to the villa opposite.

01:55:32.751 --> 01:55:33.913
Did you notice?

01:55:34.709 --> 01:55:37.577
I think so,
but I don't see much from in here.

01:55:38.293 --> 01:55:39.323
Ask her.

01:55:47.376 --> 01:55:48.785
Claire?

01:55:48.959 --> 01:55:51.413
Listen to what
this gentleman wants to say.

01:55:52.543 --> 01:55:53.573
(Claire) Yes.

01:55:54.959 --> 01:55:56.369
And the day after,

01:55:56.543 --> 01:55:59.790
other workmen came
and took everything away again.

01:56:01.918 --> 01:56:03.458
The day after?

01:56:04.751 --> 01:56:08.697
In 18 months,
three deliveries and three removals.

01:56:11.668 --> 01:56:13.954
I was here a while ago.

01:56:15.251 --> 01:56:17.455
- Do you remember?
- Nine.

01:56:19.918 --> 01:56:23.864
- What do you mean?
- You've been here nine times.

01:56:25.918 --> 01:56:27.375
Today makes 10.

01:56:27.709 --> 01:56:31.324
I was wondering if you saw
a woman leave the villa.

01:56:32.584 --> 01:56:35.784
Medium height, light hair,
a bit pale?

01:56:37.084 --> 01:56:40.948
- Yes.
- That time was 231.

01:56:42.543 --> 01:56:44.000
Are you sure?

01:56:44.334 --> 01:56:45.993
Then another six.

01:56:46.834 --> 01:56:51.788
In a year and a half,
I saw her go out 237 times.

01:56:52.168 --> 01:56:53.577
(barman) What did I say?

01:56:53.751 --> 01:56:56.204
She's a phenomenon,
remembers everything.

01:56:58.251 --> 01:56:59.792
It's not possible.

01:57:02.334 --> 01:57:04.455
You were at the villa 63 times.

01:57:04.793 --> 01:57:08.703
36 during the day and 27 at night,

01:57:09.043 --> 01:57:11.366
excluding the night
of the accident.

01:57:12.834 --> 01:57:16.247
- One, four, four.
- One, four, four?

01:57:16.584 --> 01:57:18.824
The telephone number
for the ambulance.

01:57:20.293 --> 01:57:21.869
The villa is free now.

01:57:22.251 --> 01:57:25.166
If you're interested,
I'll get you a good deal.

01:57:26.793 --> 01:57:29.411
- Who owns it?
- Me.

01:57:30.626 --> 01:57:32.700
But I don't know what to do with it.

01:57:33.793 --> 01:57:36.459
I often rent it out to cinema people.

01:57:37.376 --> 01:57:38.750
Cinema people?

01:57:39.334 --> 01:57:42.285
For the past two years,
it's been taken by the engineer

01:57:42.459 --> 01:57:44.995
who does the lift
that takes me up to my house.

01:57:45.793 --> 01:57:47.499
He's really nice, that boy.

01:57:48.418 --> 01:57:50.076
He can do anything.

01:57:50.251 --> 01:57:52.740
There's nothing he can't fix.

01:57:53.334 --> 01:57:56.665
And he's always kissing me.
(giggles)

01:57:56.834 --> 01:57:58.624
Bringing me flowers.

01:57:59.876 --> 01:58:02.116
(ethereal instrumental music)

01:58:47.834 --> 01:58:49.908
(ringing tone)

01:59:06.959 --> 01:59:08.500
(music intensifies)

02:00:29.584 --> 02:00:31.658
(Claire moans)

02:00:43.959 --> 02:00:47.740
(loudspeaker) The Paris Express
is now arriving at platform seven.

02:00:49.209 --> 02:00:50.916
Your attention, please.

02:00:51.084 --> 02:00:53.917
The Berlin-Prague Arrow
is running 40 minutes late

02:00:54.084 --> 02:00:55.281
due to fog on the line.

02:00:57.126 --> 02:00:58.667
Come in, sir.

02:01:00.001 --> 02:01:02.371
We furnished it
exactly as you requested.

02:01:03.793 --> 02:01:06.281
And tomorrow, your trunks
will be delivered.

02:01:06.459 --> 02:01:09.576
And later, I'll pass by
with a copy of your contract.

02:01:09.918 --> 02:01:13.283
If there's anything else,
please don't hesitate to call.

02:01:19.751 --> 02:01:21.292
Oh, Virgil.

02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:26.917
If anything should happen to us,
I want you to know that I do love you.

02:01:27.251 --> 02:01:29.704
(ethereal instrumental music)

02:02:38.793 --> 02:02:41.707
- (indistinct chatter)
- (bell rings)

02:02:46.793 --> 02:02:48.416
(bell rings)

02:02:54.168 --> 02:02:56.242
(clocks ticking)

02:02:57.543 --> 02:02:59.617
(indistinct chatter)

02:03:06.168 --> 02:03:08.242
(loud ticking)

02:03:10.959 --> 02:03:14.455
(indistinct speaking)

02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:52.783
(waiter) Are you on your own, sir?

02:04:03.418 --> 02:04:06.120
No. I'm waiting for someone.

02:04:14.251 --> 02:04:16.325
(instrumental music)

02:04:30.584 --> 02:04:32.658
(indistinct speaking)

02:04:51.626 --> 02:04:53.700
