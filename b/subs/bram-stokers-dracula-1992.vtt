00:39.237 --> 00:42.138
The year, 1462.

00:42.340 --> 00:45.503
Constantinople had fallen.

00:45.710 --> 00:49.580
Moslem Turks swept into Europe with a vast, superior force...

00:49.680 --> 00:53.785
...striking at Romania,
threatening all of Christendom.

00:53.885 --> 00:56.421
From Transylvania arose a Romanian knight...

00:56.521 --> 01:00.841
...of the Sacred Order of the Dragon,
known as Dracula.

01:16.974 --> 01:19.135
On the eve of the battle...

01:19.343 --> 01:22.005
...his bride Elisabeta...

01:22.213 --> 01:25.416
...whom he prized above all things on Earth...

01:25.516 --> 01:29.676
...knew that he must face an insurmountable force...

01:29.765 --> 01:33.417
...from which he might never return.

02:31.182 --> 02:35.050
God be praised.
I am victorious.

02:44.695 --> 02:46.754
Elisabeta.

02:49.667 --> 02:53.538
The vengeful Turks shot an arrow into the castle...

02:53.638 --> 02:56.998
...carrying false news of Dracula's death.

02:57.053 --> 02:59.670
Elisabeta, believing him dead...

02:59.877 --> 03:02.744
...flung herself into the river.

03:41.485 --> 03:43.919
My prince is dead.

03:44.121 --> 03:46.146
All is lost without him.

03:46.357 --> 03:49.087
May God unite us in heaven.

04:03.674 --> 04:05.834
She has taken her own life.

04:06.210 --> 04:08.644
Her soul cannot be saved.

04:09.847 --> 04:11.847
She is damned.

04:12.016 --> 04:14.016
It is God's law.

04:23.127 --> 04:26.564
Is this my reward for defending God's church?

04:26.664 --> 04:27.732
Sacrilege.

04:27.832 --> 04:31.427
I renounce God.

04:32.303 --> 04:35.898
I shall rise from my own death...

04:36.173 --> 04:40.667
...to avenge hers with all the powers of darkness.

04:58.429 --> 05:01.489
The blood is the life...

05:02.400 --> 05:06.461
...and it shall be mine.

06:02.226 --> 06:05.746
I've done everything that you asked, master.

06:07.398 --> 06:10.595
All the preparations are in order.

06:10.801 --> 06:12.503
Everything.

06:12.603 --> 06:15.265
I await your command.

06:15.473 --> 06:18.033
For I know...

06:18.242 --> 06:21.370
...that when the rewards are given...

06:21.579 --> 06:26.379
...I will be one of those who benefits from your generosity.

06:30.688 --> 06:32.688
Thank you.

06:34.191 --> 06:36.785
Gone mad.
Renfield is deranged.

06:38.629 --> 06:40.898
He's lost his greedy mind,
poor chap.

06:40.998 --> 06:43.501
I want you to take over for his foreign client...

06:43.601 --> 06:45.703
...this rather eccentric Count Dracula.

06:45.803 --> 06:49.039
He's buying up property in London.
- Of course, sir.

06:49.139 --> 06:51.976
I'll attend to the count.
Thank you for your confidence.

06:52.076 --> 06:55.179
This is a great opportunity for you, Harker.

06:55.279 --> 06:58.449
But you'll have to leave for Transylvania immediately.

06:58.549 --> 07:02.186
Opportunities such as this come but once in a lifetime.

07:02.286 --> 07:04.550
Yes, of course, sir.

07:04.755 --> 07:06.323
If I may inquire...

07:06.423 --> 07:10.094
...what, in fact, happened to Mr. Renfield in Transylvania?

07:10.194 --> 07:12.321
Nothing. Nothing.

07:12.530 --> 07:14.530
Personal problems.

07:14.598 --> 07:16.467
Close these transactions...

07:16.567 --> 07:19.770
...and your future with this firm is assured.

07:19.870 --> 07:23.230
Yes, sir.
I will give it my full attention.

07:26.844 --> 07:29.564
We've waited this long,
haven't we?

07:29.622 --> 07:32.182
We can be married when I return.

07:33.784 --> 07:35.219
Of course.

07:35.319 --> 07:37.651
I'll write.

07:38.689 --> 07:40.689
Jonathan.

07:45.095 --> 07:47.095
Jonathan, I love you.

07:47.163 --> 07:49.163
I love you, Mina.

08:19.430 --> 08:21.830
25th May, Budapest.

08:22.032 --> 08:24.401
Left Budapest early this morning.

08:24.501 --> 08:27.304
The impression I had was that we were leaving the west...

08:27.404 --> 08:29.404
...and entering the east.

08:30.074 --> 08:33.943
The district I am to enter is in the extreme east of the country...

08:34.044 --> 08:35.746
...just on the borders of three states...

08:35.846 --> 08:38.515
...Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina...

08:38.616 --> 08:40.784
...in the midst of the Carpathian Mountains...

08:40.884 --> 08:45.444
...one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe.

08:47.124 --> 08:49.456
'My friend...

08:49.660 --> 08:52.823
...welcome to the Carpathians.

08:53.030 --> 08:56.158
I am anxiously expecting you.

08:56.367 --> 08:58.367
At the Borgo Pass...

08:58.502 --> 09:02.206
...my carriage will await you and bring you to me.

09:02.306 --> 09:07.073
I trust your journey from London has been a happy one...

09:07.277 --> 09:10.114
...and that you will enjoy your stay...

09:10.214 --> 09:13.274
...in my beautiful land.

09:13.484 --> 09:17.318
Your friend, D. ”

09:25.629 --> 09:28.393
Diary, 25th May.

09:28.599 --> 09:31.830
My Jonathan has been gone almost a week.

09:32.102 --> 09:35.940
And although I was disappointed we
could not marry before his departure...

09:36.040 --> 09:39.343
...I am happy that he got sent on this important assignment.

09:39.443 --> 09:42.207
I am longing to hear all the news.

09:42.413 --> 09:46.247
It must be so nice to see strange countries.

09:46.450 --> 09:49.620
I wonder if we...
I mean Jonathan and I...

09:49.720 --> 09:52.280
...shall ever see them together.

10:06.203 --> 10:09.400
We're early, driver.
No one is here.

10:10.474 --> 10:12.704
For the dead travel fast.

11:28.352 --> 11:31.014
I say, is the castle far?

12:50.200 --> 12:52.566
Welcome to my home.

12:53.737 --> 12:55.906
Enter freely of your own will...

12:56.006 --> 12:58.976
...and leave some of the happiness you bring.

12:59.076 --> 13:00.944
Count Dracula?

13:01.044 --> 13:03.044
I am...

13:03.112 --> 13:05.112
...Dracula.

13:05.215 --> 13:08.946
And I bid you welcome,
Mr. Harker, to my house.

13:12.222 --> 13:14.222
Come in.

13:29.273 --> 13:33.073
You will, I trust,
excuse me that I...

13:33.277 --> 13:35.472
...do not join you.

13:38.315 --> 13:41.011
But I have already dined.

13:42.119 --> 13:44.815
And I never drink...

13:47.257 --> 13:49.384
...wine.

13:54.331 --> 13:57.664
An ancestor?
I see a resemblance.

13:59.603 --> 14:02.663
The Order of the Dracul.

14:04.641 --> 14:07.235
The Dragon.

14:07.444 --> 14:09.776
An ancient society...

14:09.980 --> 14:13.541
...pledging my forefathers...

14:13.750 --> 14:18.230
...to defend their church against all enemies of Christ.

14:21.024 --> 14:24.892
That relationship was not entirely...

14:26.363 --> 14:28.363
...successful.

14:28.448 --> 14:30.448
Oh, yes.

14:34.204 --> 14:37.196
It is no laughing matter.

14:40.344 --> 14:43.939
We Draculs have a right to be proud.

14:44.147 --> 14:47.117
What devil or witch was ever so great as Attila...

14:47.217 --> 14:50.516
...whose blood flows in these veins?

14:55.425 --> 14:57.425
Blood...

15:01.698 --> 15:05.896
...is too precious a thing in these times.

15:10.273 --> 15:14.539
The warlike days are over.

15:15.579 --> 15:19.743
The victories of my great race...

15:19.950 --> 15:22.646
...are but a tale to be told.

15:25.722 --> 15:29.715
I am the last of my kind.

15:32.229 --> 15:35.829
I have offended you with my ignorance, Count.

15:36.366 --> 15:38.366
Forgive me.

15:50.347 --> 15:53.784
I do so long to go through the crowded streets...

15:53.884 --> 15:56.079
...of your mighty London...

15:56.286 --> 16:01.058
...to be in the midst of the whirl and the rush of humanity...

16:01.158 --> 16:03.422
...to share its life...

16:03.627 --> 16:06.619
...its changes, its death.

16:06.830 --> 16:10.197
There. You, Count, are...

16:12.736 --> 16:15.372
Are the owner of Carfax Abbey at Purfleet.

16:15.472 --> 16:17.633
Congratulations.

16:17.841 --> 16:20.537
Your firm writes most highly...

16:20.744 --> 16:22.145
...of your talents.

16:22.245 --> 16:26.011
They say you are a man of good...

16:26.216 --> 16:28.216
...taste.

16:29.619 --> 16:32.222
And that you are a worthy substitute...

16:32.322 --> 16:37.089
...to your predecessor, Mr. Renfield.

16:37.294 --> 16:39.888
You may rely on me, Count.

16:40.097 --> 16:42.866
Forgive my curiosity,
but why ten houses...

16:42.966 --> 16:45.702
...in such precise locations around London?

16:45.802 --> 16:48.396
Is it to raise the market value?

16:51.108 --> 16:53.668
Do you believe in destiny?

16:56.580 --> 17:01.176
That even the powers of time...

17:01.384 --> 17:04.580
...can be altered for a single purpose?

17:13.964 --> 17:16.465
The luckiest man who walks on this Earth...

17:16.566 --> 17:19.660
...is the one who finds...

17:19.869 --> 17:22.099
...true love.

17:22.305 --> 17:24.967
You found Mina.

17:25.175 --> 17:27.473
I thought she was lost.

17:27.676 --> 17:30.877
We're to be married as soon as I return.

17:31.014 --> 17:33.039
Are you married, Count?

17:34.417 --> 17:35.585
Sir...

17:35.685 --> 17:37.685
...are you married?

17:38.955 --> 17:41.788
I was married once.

17:41.992 --> 17:44.187
Ages ago, it seems.

17:45.462 --> 17:47.462
She died.

17:49.332 --> 17:51.332
I'm very sorry.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.400
She was fortunate.

17:56.006 --> 17:59.373
My life, at its best, is misery.

18:04.181 --> 18:07.221
She will no doubt make a devoted wife.

18:08.418 --> 18:10.886
And you a faithful husband.

18:14.391 --> 18:16.059
Come.

18:16.159 --> 18:19.754
Write now, my friend,
to your firm...

18:19.963 --> 18:23.900
...and to any loved ones,
and say that it shall please you...

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
...to stay with me...

18:26.203 --> 18:28.283
...until a month from now.

18:29.639 --> 18:31.639
A month?

18:32.676 --> 18:35.156
Do you wish me to stay so long?

18:37.480 --> 18:41.280
I will take no refusal.

18:52.629 --> 18:56.121
Diary, 30th of May, 1897.

18:56.333 --> 19:00.971
I know Jonathan does not want me to
stay here with Lucy while he is away.

19:01.071 --> 19:05.408
He thinks that if I become accustomed
to the wealth of the Westenra family...

19:05.508 --> 19:09.379
...I will not be content as the wife of a mere clerk in a law firm.

19:09.479 --> 19:12.282
But Lucy and I have been friends since we were children...

19:12.382 --> 19:17.182
...and she has never minded that I am only a schoolmistress.

19:24.794 --> 19:26.955
How disgustingly awful.

19:29.933 --> 19:31.933
Mina.

19:37.140 --> 19:40.007
Oh, Mina, you're always working.

19:41.411 --> 19:43.413
Is your ambitious Jon Harker...

19:43.513 --> 19:47.250
...forcing you to learn that ridiculous machine?

19:47.350 --> 19:49.619
When he could be forcing you to perform...

19:49.719 --> 19:53.924
...unspeakable acts of desperate passion on the parlor floor.

19:54.024 --> 19:55.625
Lucy, really.

19:55.725 --> 19:58.628
You shouldn't talk about my fiancé in such a way.

19:58.728 --> 20:02.408
There's more to marriage than carnal pleasure.

20:02.666 --> 20:06.193
Oh, Mina. So I see.

20:06.403 --> 20:08.769
Much, much more.

20:11.207 --> 20:13.207
That's...

20:15.445 --> 20:17.709
What is it, Lucy?

20:17.914 --> 20:20.348
Because I don't understand it.

20:21.251 --> 20:23.811
Can a man and woman really do...

20:24.054 --> 20:25.322
...that?

20:25.422 --> 20:27.890
I did, only last night.

20:28.091 --> 20:30.787
Fibber. You did not.
- Yes, I did.

20:32.095 --> 20:35.030
Well, in my dreams.

20:35.231 --> 20:38.029
Jonathan measures up,
doesn't he?

20:38.234 --> 20:40.234
You can tell Lucy.

20:41.237 --> 20:43.671
We've kissed. That's all.

20:43.873 --> 20:46.753
He thinks he's too poor to marry me.

20:48.011 --> 20:51.514
And it's all the worse now that I'm here visiting you at Hillingham...

20:51.614 --> 20:53.283
...my rich friend.

20:53.383 --> 20:56.819
Yes, but not even one marriage proposal.

20:57.020 --> 20:59.284
And here I am, almost 20...

20:59.489 --> 21:01.753
...practically a hag.

21:07.597 --> 21:10.430
Mr. Quincey P. Morris.

21:11.835 --> 21:15.498
Oh, look.
- What is that?

21:15.705 --> 21:17.866
A Texan.

21:18.074 --> 21:20.074
Quincey P. Morris.

21:20.276 --> 21:23.006
He's so young and fresh...

21:23.213 --> 21:25.482
...like a wild stallion between my legs.

21:25.582 --> 21:27.617
You're positively indecent.

21:27.717 --> 21:30.151
I just know what men desire.

21:30.353 --> 21:32.055
Watch.

21:32.155 --> 21:34.680
Quincey, darling.
- Miss Lucy.

21:35.792 --> 21:37.794
Why, you're as fresh as the spring rain.

21:37.894 --> 21:39.894
Oh, thank you.

21:43.767 --> 21:46.292
Please let me touch it.

21:47.303 --> 21:50.329
It's so big.

21:53.510 --> 21:54.978
Little girl.

21:55.078 --> 21:58.206
Oh, my dear,
sweet little girl.

21:58.415 --> 22:00.474
I hold your hand...

22:00.683 --> 22:03.163
...and you've kissed me.
- Jack.

22:04.287 --> 22:07.745
Oceans of love...
Oh, Jack, my darling.

22:07.957 --> 22:09.659
Poor little baby.

22:09.759 --> 22:11.695
My kitten, come over here.

22:11.795 --> 22:14.030
Come over here and I'll kiss it better.

22:14.130 --> 22:16.291
My poor little blossom.

22:16.499 --> 22:19.619
My poor little doctor.
Brilliant doctor.

22:19.769 --> 22:21.769
Hello, Quincey.
- Jack.

22:21.820 --> 22:24.140
What a naughty bear.
Let me...

22:24.207 --> 22:27.335
Arthur Holmwood, Esquire.
- Arthur.

22:28.111 --> 22:30.443
Oh, my darling.

22:30.647 --> 22:33.047
Oh, you look wonderful.

22:33.249 --> 22:35.979
I'm so sorry about your hat.

22:36.186 --> 22:38.088
Charming.
- It's my snake dress.

22:38.188 --> 22:39.556
Is it really?

22:39.656 --> 22:42.456
Lucy is a pure and virtuous girl...

22:42.541 --> 22:46.596
...but I admit that her free way of speaking shocks me sometimes.

22:46.696 --> 22:49.766
Jonathan says it is a defect of the aristocracy...

22:49.866 --> 22:52.168
...that they say what they please.

22:52.268 --> 22:57.440
The truth is that I admire Lucy. I'm
not surprised that men flock around her.

22:57.540 --> 23:01.140
I wish I were as pretty and as adored as she.

23:18.528 --> 23:20.688
What manner of man is this?

23:21.431 --> 23:23.933
R.M. Renfield,
successful solicitor...

23:24.033 --> 23:26.936
...in the firm of Hawkins and Thompkins...

23:27.036 --> 23:29.906
...respected member of the Lord Nugent's Windem Club...

23:30.006 --> 23:34.340
...returns from business abroad in Transylvania...

23:34.544 --> 23:37.580
...promptly suffers a complete mental breakdown.

23:37.680 --> 23:40.911
He's now obsessed with some blood lust.

23:45.021 --> 23:47.021
George.

23:48.958 --> 23:50.958
Wait here.

23:58.134 --> 24:01.237
Would you care for an hors d'oeuvre, Dr. Seward...

24:01.337 --> 24:03.965
...or a canapé?

24:04.173 --> 24:08.653
No, thank you, Mr. Renfield.
How are you feeling tonight?

24:08.945 --> 24:11.514
Far better than you,
my lovesick doctor.

24:11.614 --> 24:13.516
Is my personal life of interest to you?

24:13.616 --> 24:17.484
Of course it is.
All life interests me.

24:17.687 --> 24:20.623
Your diet, Mr. Renfield,
is disgusting.

24:20.723 --> 24:24.090
Actually,
they're perfectly nutritious.

24:24.294 --> 24:27.058
You see,
each life that I ingest...

24:27.263 --> 24:29.424
...gives back life to me.

24:33.102 --> 24:35.900
A fly gives you life?

24:36.105 --> 24:37.907
Certainly.

24:38.007 --> 24:42.078
But you might as well ask a man to eat
molecules with a pair of chopsticks...

24:42.178 --> 24:44.981
...than to interest me in a lesser carnivore.

24:45.081 --> 24:49.652
I shall have to invent a new classification of lunatic for you.

24:49.752 --> 24:53.984
What about spiders?
Spiders eat the flies.

24:55.592 --> 24:57.651
Yes, spiders eat them.

24:57.860 --> 25:00.158
What about sparrows?

25:00.363 --> 25:03.628
Oh, yes.
Did you say sparrows?

25:03.833 --> 25:07.963
Something larger, perhaps?
- Oh, yes.

25:09.372 --> 25:11.431
A kitten.

25:11.641 --> 25:13.276
I beg you.

25:13.376 --> 25:16.277
A little, sleek... A playful kitten.

25:16.479 --> 25:19.919
Something I can teach.
Something I can feed.

25:19.984 --> 25:21.851
No one would refuse me a kitten.

25:21.951 --> 25:24.215
Wouldn't you prefer a cat?

25:26.422 --> 25:28.124
Oh, yes.

25:28.224 --> 25:30.224
A big cat.

25:30.426 --> 25:33.429
My salvation depends upon it.
- Your salvation?

25:33.529 --> 25:35.529
Yes. I need lives.

25:35.698 --> 25:39.058
I need lives for the master.
- What master?

25:41.571 --> 25:44.005
The master will come...

25:45.141 --> 25:48.311
...and he has promised to make me immortal.

25:48.411 --> 25:50.411
How?

25:51.514 --> 25:53.514
Get him off.

25:54.651 --> 25:56.915
The blood is the life.

25:58.021 --> 26:00.080
The blood is the life.

26:01.858 --> 26:04.486
30th May, Castle Dracula.

26:04.694 --> 26:09.065
I think strange things which I dare not confess to my own soul.

26:09.165 --> 26:10.567
The count...

26:10.667 --> 26:14.137
...the way he looked at Mina's picture fills me with dread...

26:14.237 --> 26:19.517
...as if I have a part to play in a story that is not known to me.

26:42.031 --> 26:44.111
I didn't hear you come in.

26:46.836 --> 26:49.862
Take care how you cut yourself.

26:50.073 --> 26:53.440
It is more dangerous than you think.

26:59.782 --> 27:04.776
A foul bauble of man's vanity.

27:04.987 --> 27:07.251
Perhaps you should...

27:07.457 --> 27:09.584
...grow a beard.

27:17.133 --> 27:19.931
The letters I requested.

27:20.136 --> 27:22.331
Have you written them?

27:38.921 --> 27:40.921
Good.

27:49.565 --> 27:52.898
Should you leave these rooms...

27:54.337 --> 27:56.606
...you will not, by any chance...

27:56.706 --> 28:00.466
...go to sleep in any other part of the castle.

28:01.711 --> 28:03.872
It is old...

28:05.114 --> 28:08.015
...and has many bad memories.

28:10.086 --> 28:13.681
Be warned.
- I'm sure I understand.

28:22.265 --> 28:26.258
Do not put your faith in such trinkets of deceit.

28:28.004 --> 28:30.734
We are in Transylvania.

28:32.241 --> 28:35.768
Transylvania is not England.

28:35.978 --> 28:39.106
Our ways are not your ways.

28:39.315 --> 28:41.315
And to you...

28:41.484 --> 28:44.681
...there shall be many strange things.

28:44.887 --> 28:48.118
I've seen many strange things already.

28:48.324 --> 28:52.404
Bloody wolves chasing me through some blue inferno.

28:56.966 --> 28:59.730
Listen to them.

29:04.140 --> 29:07.109
The children of the night.

29:09.045 --> 29:11.411
What sweet music they make.

29:11.614 --> 29:14.606
Music? Those animals?

29:48.651 --> 29:52.985
I did as Dracula instructed.
I wrote three letters.

29:53.189 --> 29:56.692
To the firm, to my family and to my beloved Mina.

29:56.792 --> 30:01.432
I said nothing of my fears as he will read them, no doubt.

30:05.101 --> 30:07.661
I know now that I am a prisoner.

31:33.022 --> 31:35.022
Jonathan.

31:36.025 --> 31:38.255
Jonathan, come to me.

31:48.004 --> 31:50.004
Come.

32:08.224 --> 32:10.224
Lay down.

32:11.327 --> 32:13.327
Lay back into my arms.

32:22.972 --> 32:25.304
Lay back, Jonathan.

34:26.328 --> 34:30.230
How dare you touch him.
He belongs to me.

34:30.833 --> 34:32.833
You yourself never loved.

34:35.971 --> 34:40.567
Yes. I too can love.

34:42.777 --> 34:46.771
And I shall love again.

34:55.324 --> 34:57.986
Are we to have nothing tonight?

35:42.238 --> 35:44.763
'Dearest Mina,
all is well here.

35:44.974 --> 35:47.877
The count has insisted I remain for a month...

35:47.977 --> 35:50.279
...to tutor him in English custom.

35:50.379 --> 35:53.712
I can say no more,
except I love you.

35:53.916 --> 35:56.612
Ever faithful, Jonathan. ”

36:00.022 --> 36:04.742
The letters I have written have undoubtedly sealed my doom.

36:07.596 --> 36:11.433
The count's gypsies, fearless warriors who are loyal to the death...

36:11.533 --> 36:14.493
...to whatever nobleman they serve...

36:16.572 --> 36:20.276
...day and night they toil,
filling boxes with decrepit earth...

36:20.376 --> 36:23.573
...from the bowels of the castle.

36:24.780 --> 36:30.380
They are to be delivered to his newly acquired Carfax Abbey in London.

36:31.320 --> 36:35.154
Why do they fill these boxes with earth?

36:40.362 --> 36:42.922
I love him. I love him.

36:46.135 --> 36:48.968
It's so wonderful.
I've decided.

36:49.171 --> 36:51.605
I love him and I've said yes.

36:51.807 --> 36:55.311
Finally. Don't tell me.
The Texan with the big knife?

36:55.411 --> 36:58.209
Oh, no.
To my dear number three.

36:58.414 --> 37:02.316
Lord Arthur Holmwood.
Lord and Lady Holmwood.

37:02.518 --> 37:05.321
You are to be my maid of honor.
Oh, say yes.

37:05.421 --> 37:09.821
Mina, what is it?
It's the most exciting day of my life.

37:11.226 --> 37:13.226
You don't seem to care.

37:13.429 --> 37:16.565
It's just that I'm so terribly worried about Jonathan.

37:16.665 --> 37:18.901
This letter I received is so...

37:19.001 --> 37:23.372
It's so cold. It's so unnatural.
It's not like him at all.

37:23.472 --> 37:25.472
Mina, don't worry.

37:52.234 --> 37:54.169
Captain's log: The Demeter.

37:54.269 --> 37:57.363
27th June, 1897.

37:59.475 --> 38:02.544
We picked up 50 boxes of experimental earth...

38:02.644 --> 38:04.964
...bound for London, England.

38:05.056 --> 38:07.283
Set sail at noon into a storm...

38:07.383 --> 38:09.952
...that seemed to come out of nowhere...

38:10.052 --> 38:12.418
...carrying us out to sea.

38:47.556 --> 38:51.117
Third of July.
Second mate has gone missing.

38:51.326 --> 38:55.729
Nearing Gibraltar.
Storm continues. Crew uneasy.

38:56.665 --> 38:59.498
Believe someone or something...

38:59.701 --> 39:02.261
...is aboard the ship with us.

39:14.983 --> 39:17.213
Master, I am here.

39:18.220 --> 39:21.189
The master of all life is at hand.

39:21.390 --> 39:23.390
Gather round.

39:23.475 --> 39:25.961
I am here to do your bidding, master.

39:26.061 --> 39:28.464
I have worshipped you long and far off.

39:28.564 --> 39:31.965
And now you are near, master.

39:32.167 --> 39:34.727
I am your slave.

39:34.937 --> 39:37.497
I await your command.

39:37.706 --> 39:40.509
The case of Renfield grows more interesting.

39:40.609 --> 39:44.480
Yet, there is method in his madness with his flies and spiders.

39:44.580 --> 39:47.816
Had I the secret of even one such brilliant mind...

39:47.916 --> 39:51.716
...the key to the fancy of one lunatic...

39:58.126 --> 40:00.126
Lucy.

40:57.653 --> 40:59.985
Lucy? Lucy.

42:39.988 --> 42:44.049
No. Do not see me.

42:59.574 --> 43:02.634
Oh. I couldn't control myself.

43:02.844 --> 43:06.715
Hush, Lucy. You're dreaming.
You're walking in your sleep again.

43:06.815 --> 43:10.774
My soul,
it seemed to leave my body.

43:10.986 --> 43:15.724
There was this agonizing feeling,
and I couldn't get back to it.

43:15.824 --> 43:17.292
I'm absolutely shaking.

43:17.392 --> 43:19.328
It's all right.
You were dreaming.

43:19.428 --> 43:22.731
I had to. It sort of pulled me and lured me.

43:22.831 --> 43:25.891
I had no control.
- It's all right.

43:26.101 --> 43:29.002
It had red eyes.
- Hush now.

43:29.204 --> 43:33.044
I still have the taste of his blood in my mouth.

43:45.854 --> 43:48.618
Here we go.
Swing it round here.

43:50.625 --> 43:52.625
Master.

43:53.428 --> 43:56.295
I am here to do your bidding.

43:57.099 --> 44:00.330
Master. I am here.

44:01.870 --> 44:04.100
I have worshipped you.

44:07.042 --> 44:09.945
Contrary to some beliefs,
the vampire...

44:10.045 --> 44:14.082
...like any other night creature,
can move about by day...

44:14.182 --> 44:19.062
...though it is not his natural time,
and his powers are weak.

44:35.103 --> 44:38.197
See the amazing cinematograph.

44:38.406 --> 44:41.341
A wonder of modern civilization.

44:41.543 --> 44:43.704
The latest sensation.

44:43.912 --> 44:47.032
The greatest attraction of the century.

44:47.124 --> 44:49.845
The new wonder of the world.

45:14.209 --> 45:16.209
See me.

45:17.979 --> 45:19.979
See me now.

45:25.954 --> 45:29.151
Escaped wolf from zoo still at large.

45:29.357 --> 45:31.357
Buy a paper, sir?

45:33.528 --> 45:35.528
Thank you, sir.

45:37.566 --> 45:41.058
Get your Gazette.
Penny a paper.

45:54.316 --> 45:56.807
My humblest apologies.

45:58.053 --> 46:00.920
Forgive my ignorance.

46:01.122 --> 46:04.091
I am recently arrived from abroad...

46:04.292 --> 46:07.261
...and I do not know your city.

46:07.462 --> 46:12.342
Is a beautiful lady...
- A street atlas is sixpence. Good day.

46:14.269 --> 46:16.269
I have offended you.

46:17.739 --> 46:20.075
I am only looking for the cinematograph.

46:20.175 --> 46:23.712
I understand it is a wonder of the civilized world.

46:23.812 --> 46:27.475
If you seek culture,
then visit a museum.

46:27.682 --> 46:30.642
London is filled with them.
Excuse me.

46:39.928 --> 46:42.631
A woman so lovely and intelligent...

46:42.731 --> 46:46.334
...should not be walking the streets of London without her gentleman.

46:46.434 --> 46:48.629
Do I know you, sir?

46:49.905 --> 46:52.738
Are you acquainted with my husband?

46:52.941 --> 46:54.941
Shall I call the police?

46:56.645 --> 46:58.772
Husband?

46:58.980 --> 47:01.380
I shall bother you no more.

47:05.153 --> 47:07.153
Sir.

47:07.923 --> 47:10.483
It is I who have been rude.

47:10.692 --> 47:13.456
If you're looking...
- Please.

47:15.830 --> 47:18.390
Permit me to introduce myself.

47:20.302 --> 47:24.500
I am Prince Vlad of Sagite.

47:27.542 --> 47:29.702
A prince, no less?
- I am...

47:31.146 --> 47:33.146
...your servant.

47:35.350 --> 47:37.910
Wilhelmina Murray.

47:40.922 --> 47:43.516
I am...

47:43.725 --> 47:45.725
...honored...

47:45.894 --> 47:47.894
...Madam Mina.

47:51.766 --> 47:53.766
This way.

48:06.781 --> 48:08.781
Hello, sir.

48:08.849 --> 48:12.153
Mr. Holmwood asked me to stop by to see Miss Lucy.

48:12.253 --> 48:13.755
Yes, sir.

48:13.855 --> 48:16.575
Dr. Seward, Miss Lucy.
- Thank you.

48:16.691 --> 48:18.326
Oh, Jack.

48:18.426 --> 48:21.623
Brilliant Jack.
Do you like it?

48:23.465 --> 48:25.500
Did Arthur put you up to this...

48:25.600 --> 48:29.938
...or did you want me alone just once before I'm married?

48:30.038 --> 48:32.506
Lucy, you're embarrassing me.

48:32.707 --> 48:35.369
I'm here as your doctor.

48:35.577 --> 48:37.812
Your fiancé is very worried about you...

48:37.912 --> 48:42.679
...and I assure you,
a doctor's confidence is sacred.

48:42.884 --> 48:45.444
I must have your complete trust.

48:49.657 --> 48:51.657
Help me, Jack.

48:52.994 --> 48:55.764
I don't know what's happening to me.

48:55.864 --> 48:57.889
I'm changing.

48:58.099 --> 49:00.099
I can feel it.

49:01.536 --> 49:03.536
I can hear everything.

49:03.604 --> 49:06.641
I hear the servants at the other end of the house, whispering.

49:06.741 --> 49:10.661
I hear mice in the attic,
stomping like elephants.

49:11.179 --> 49:14.459
But I'm having horrible nightmares, Jack.

49:15.950 --> 49:17.552
The eyes.

49:17.652 --> 49:19.054
Oh, Jack.

49:19.154 --> 49:22.783
I'm here, Lucy.
Nothing will harm you.

49:25.794 --> 49:27.794
Let it work.

49:29.230 --> 49:31.425
Thank you.
- Lucy.

49:31.633 --> 49:33.999
Oh, Jack, kiss me.

49:39.140 --> 49:42.077
And may I say, Miss Lucy is hotter than a June bride...

49:42.177 --> 49:44.579
...riding bareback buck naked in the Sahara.

49:44.679 --> 49:48.316
I would watch my colonial tongue if I were you.

49:48.416 --> 49:52.375
Hello, Jack.
And how's our lovely patient today?

49:52.587 --> 49:56.250
Well, frankly, Arthur,
I'm confounded.

49:56.458 --> 49:59.160
Jack, are you still brooding over Miss Lucy?

49:59.260 --> 50:02.831
I can only conclude it must be something mental.

50:02.931 --> 50:06.298
How very droll.
Did you hear that, Quince?

50:06.501 --> 50:11.373
Last week he wanted to marry her, and
now he wants to have her committed.

50:11.473 --> 50:13.473
Let's have a look at her.

50:23.651 --> 50:26.620
I'm at a loss, I admit.

50:26.821 --> 50:29.491
I've taken the liberty of cabling Abraham Van Helsing...

50:29.591 --> 50:31.593
...the metaphysician, philosopher.

50:31.693 --> 50:34.562
Sounds like a goddamn witch doctor to me, Jack.

50:34.662 --> 50:38.533
Van Helsing knows more about obscure
diseases than any man in the world.

50:38.633 --> 50:40.793
He's my teacher and mentor.

50:43.738 --> 50:47.174
Do it, man.
Bring him here.

50:47.375 --> 50:49.375
Spare no expense.

51:24.145 --> 51:25.880
Astounding.

51:25.980 --> 51:28.744
There are no limits to science.

51:31.019 --> 51:33.419
How can you call this science?

51:34.656 --> 51:37.692
Do you think Madam Curie would invite such comparisons?

51:37.792 --> 51:39.792
Really.

51:43.364 --> 51:45.798
I shouldn't have come here.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
I must go.

51:53.174 --> 51:55.174
Do not fear me.

52:10.258 --> 52:11.960
Stop this.

52:12.060 --> 52:14.060
Stop this.

52:23.972 --> 52:26.532
My God. Who are you?

52:26.741 --> 52:28.476
I know you.

52:28.576 --> 52:33.070
I have crossed oceans of time...

52:33.281 --> 52:35.281
...to find you.

53:14.255 --> 53:16.335
There is no need to panic.

53:16.457 --> 53:21.177
The animal handlers have everything under complete control.

53:40.181 --> 53:42.181
Come here, Mina.

54:01.469 --> 54:03.469
He likes you.

54:29.297 --> 54:32.528
There is much to be learned from beasts.

55:45.740 --> 55:47.975
The tropical pampas vampire bat must...

55:48.075 --> 55:52.814
...consume ten times its own weight in fresh blood each day...

55:52.914 --> 55:55.714
...or its own blood cells will die.

56:04.625 --> 56:06.625
Cute little vermin, ja?

56:07.695 --> 56:10.331
Blood and the diseases of the blood...

56:10.431 --> 56:13.711
...such as syphilis,
they concern us here.

56:14.302 --> 56:16.637
The very name 'venereal diseases'...

56:16.737 --> 56:20.441
...the diseases of Venus,
imputes to them divine origin.

56:20.541 --> 56:24.011
And they are involved in that sex problem about which...

56:24.111 --> 56:28.216
...the ethics and ideals of Christian civilization are concerned.

56:28.316 --> 56:33.356
In fact, civilization and syphilization have advanced together.

56:36.491 --> 56:39.260
What is this?
- It's from the telegraph, Professor.

56:39.360 --> 56:41.360
Telegraph?

56:44.432 --> 56:48.352
Thank you. Gentlemen, thank you.
That will be all.

56:58.513 --> 57:00.538
Dawn.

57:00.748 --> 57:03.651
These may be the last words I write in this journal.

57:03.751 --> 57:06.454
Dracula has left me with these women...

57:06.554 --> 57:08.714
...these devils of the pit.

57:08.785 --> 57:10.992
They drain my blood to keep me weak...

57:11.092 --> 57:13.892
...barely alive so I cannot escape.

57:13.977 --> 57:17.365
I will try one last time today to escape to the water.

57:17.465 --> 57:20.368
There must be passageway to the river...

57:20.468 --> 57:22.937
...and then away from this cursed land...

57:23.037 --> 57:28.237
...where the devil and his children still walk with earthly feet.

57:36.484 --> 57:38.653
For the record, I do attest...

57:38.753 --> 57:42.023
that at this point,
I, Abraham Van Helsing...

57:42.123 --> 57:46.443
...became personally involved in these strange events.

58:40.014 --> 58:43.694
Professor Van Helsing,
how good of you to come.

58:47.622 --> 58:51.058
I always come to my friends in need when they call me.

58:51.158 --> 58:53.628
So, Jack, tell me everything about your case.

58:53.728 --> 58:56.664
She has all the usual physical anemic signs.

58:56.764 --> 58:59.967
Her blood analyzes normal,
and yet it is not.

59:00.067 --> 59:03.671
She manifests continued blood loss.
I cannot trace the cause.

59:03.771 --> 59:05.771
Blood loss? How?

59:15.049 --> 59:17.049
My God, close the doors.

59:27.962 --> 59:29.096
My God...

59:29.196 --> 59:31.255
...she's only a child.

59:32.933 --> 59:34.933
Ja.

59:35.703 --> 59:37.703
My God.

59:37.805 --> 59:41.876
There's no time to lose.
There must be a transfusion at once.

59:41.976 --> 59:44.645
Take off your coat.
Remember how to tie a tourniquet?

59:44.745 --> 59:47.181
Or have you forgotten?
- You perfected a procedure?

59:47.281 --> 59:49.750
Perfected? No.
I've only experimented.

59:49.850 --> 59:51.850
Landsteiner's method.

59:53.587 --> 59:55.748
Animals, goats, sheeps.

59:57.458 --> 59:59.393
If hemolysis occurs in the blood donor serum...

59:59.493 --> 01:00:01.228
...her red blood cells will explode.

01:00:01.328 --> 01:00:03.626
She will die.
Take this tube.

01:00:07.635 --> 01:00:09.804
What in God's name is going on up here?

01:00:09.904 --> 01:00:11.806
This is Professor Van Helsing, Art.

01:00:11.906 --> 01:00:14.375
What the hell is he doing to Lucy?
- He's trying to save her life.

01:00:14.475 --> 01:00:17.435
Good God.
- You're the fiancé? Please.

01:00:20.481 --> 01:00:23.584
Take off your coat.
This young lady's very ill. She's dying.

01:00:23.684 --> 01:00:25.753
She wants blood and blood she must have.

01:00:25.853 --> 01:00:27.254
Take off your coat.

01:00:27.354 --> 01:00:29.354
Roll up your sleeve, Art.

01:00:30.624 --> 01:00:32.888
Oh, God.
- Quickly, quickly.

01:00:33.094 --> 01:00:34.695
Roll it up.

01:00:34.795 --> 01:00:37.035
This may hurt a little, Art.

01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:51.879
Forgive me. My life is hers. I would
give my last drop of blood to save her.

01:00:51.979 --> 01:00:53.979
Your last drop?

01:00:54.064 --> 01:00:55.716
Thank you.

01:00:55.816 --> 01:01:00.254
You are very welcome here.
I don't ask as much as that. Not yet.

01:01:00.354 --> 01:01:02.354
Hold her hand.

01:01:14.335 --> 01:01:18.739
Jack, that poor creature has had the
blood of two men put into her already.

01:01:18.839 --> 01:01:23.319
Man alive. Her whole body couldn't hold that much blood.

01:01:25.513 --> 01:01:29.833
What took it out?
- That's a good question, Mr. Morris.

01:01:34.321 --> 01:01:36.290
Those marks on her throat...

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:38.826
...no disease, no trituration...

01:01:38.926 --> 01:01:40.828
...I am sure the blood loss occurred there.

01:01:40.928 --> 01:01:43.088
Oh? Where did the blood go?

01:01:44.398 --> 01:01:46.734
You were once a careful student, Jack.

01:01:46.834 --> 01:01:48.736
Use your brain.
Where did the blood go?

01:01:48.836 --> 01:01:50.836
Tell me.

01:01:51.372 --> 01:01:53.641
The bed would be covered in blood.
- Exactly.

01:01:53.741 --> 01:01:56.210
You do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear...

01:01:56.310 --> 01:01:58.646
...that which you cannot account for.

01:01:58.746 --> 01:02:03.866
Something just went up there,
sucked it out of her and flew away?

01:02:04.285 --> 01:02:06.120
Ja. Why not?

01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:10.418
That's brilliant.
That's absolutely brilliant.

01:02:10.624 --> 01:02:12.793
Will one of you learned doctors,
or whatever you are...

01:02:12.893 --> 01:02:16.130
...kindly tell me what is going on with my Lucy?

01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:18.790
Jack, you are a scientist.

01:02:18.999 --> 01:02:22.403
Do you not think there are things in
this universe you cannot understand...

01:02:22.503 --> 01:02:25.039
...and which are true.
Mesmerism, hypnotism?

01:02:25.139 --> 01:02:27.274
You and Charcot have proved hypnotism.

01:02:27.374 --> 01:02:29.854
Materialization, astral bodies.

01:02:38.586 --> 01:02:40.586
Professor?

01:02:42.089 --> 01:02:44.089
Where did he go?

01:02:46.527 --> 01:02:48.527
You see?

01:02:48.595 --> 01:02:50.998
I feel like a blundering novice.

01:02:51.098 --> 01:02:54.702
Gentlemen, we're not fighting some disease here.

01:02:54.802 --> 01:02:56.871
Those marks on your dear Miss Lucy's neck were made...

01:02:56.971 --> 01:02:59.173
...by something unspeakable out there.

01:02:59.273 --> 01:03:00.508
Dead, but not dead.

01:03:00.608 --> 01:03:03.744
It stalks us for some dread purpose I do not comprehend.

01:03:03.844 --> 01:03:06.981
To live, it feeds on Lucy's precious blood.

01:03:07.081 --> 01:03:09.481
It is a beast, a monster.

01:03:28.235 --> 01:03:31.227
What is happening to Lucy and to me?

01:03:31.438 --> 01:03:34.675
When I was younger,
my feelings were never troubled.

01:03:34.775 --> 01:03:37.095
I wish I were myself again...

01:03:37.244 --> 01:03:40.907
...the sensible Mina I always depended on.

01:03:47.421 --> 01:03:49.421
Absinthe...

01:03:49.623 --> 01:03:52.343
...is the aphrodisiac of the self.

01:03:53.928 --> 01:03:56.453
The green fairy...

01:03:56.664 --> 01:04:01.363
...who lives in the absinthe...

01:04:01.568 --> 01:04:03.568
...wants your soul.

01:04:06.373 --> 01:04:08.373
But...

01:04:09.009 --> 01:04:12.001
...you are safe with me.

01:04:26.794 --> 01:04:29.024
Tell me, Prince...

01:04:29.229 --> 01:04:31.254
...tell me of your home.

01:04:33.901 --> 01:04:36.062
The most beautiful place...

01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:38.270
...in all creation.

01:04:39.006 --> 01:04:42.840
Yes, it must be.

01:04:46.513 --> 01:04:50.677
A land beyond a great, vast forest...

01:04:53.387 --> 01:04:56.427
...surrounded by majestic mountains...

01:04:57.891 --> 01:04:59.891
...lush vineyards...

01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:06.323
...and flowers of such frailty and beauty...

01:05:06.533 --> 01:05:09.013
...as to be found nowhere else.

01:05:18.812 --> 01:05:20.748
You've described my home...

01:05:20.848 --> 01:05:23.648
...as if you had seen it firsthand.

01:05:27.121 --> 01:05:30.147
It's your voice, perhaps.

01:05:30.357 --> 01:05:32.357
It's so familiar.

01:05:34.261 --> 01:05:36.261
It's like...

01:05:37.598 --> 01:05:41.278
It's like a voice in a dream I cannot place...

01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:45.830
...and it comforts me.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:49.000
When I am alone.
- When you are alone.

01:06:10.397 --> 01:06:12.456
And what of the princess?

01:06:19.339 --> 01:06:20.908
Princess?

01:06:21.008 --> 01:06:23.328
There is always a princess...

01:06:25.079 --> 01:06:27.479
...with gowns flowing white.

01:06:31.718 --> 01:06:34.744
And her face.

01:06:34.955 --> 01:06:37.924
Oh, God...

01:06:38.125 --> 01:06:40.125
...her face...

01:06:43.764 --> 01:06:45.764
...is a river.

01:06:50.804 --> 01:06:52.804
The princess...

01:06:53.807 --> 01:06:57.647
...she's a river filled with tears of sadness...

01:06:58.679 --> 01:07:00.679
...and heartbreak.

01:07:04.852 --> 01:07:06.852
There was a princess.

01:07:10.357 --> 01:07:12.357
Elisabeta.

01:07:14.962 --> 01:07:16.897
She was the most radiant woman...

01:07:16.997 --> 01:07:19.797
...in all the empires of the world.

01:07:26.607 --> 01:07:30.287
Man's deceit took her from her ancient prince.

01:07:32.379 --> 01:07:35.143
She leapt to her death...

01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:38.229
...into the river that you spoke of.

01:07:38.819 --> 01:07:41.720
In my mother's tongue...

01:07:43.223 --> 01:07:45.223
...it is called...

01:07:46.426 --> 01:07:48.451
...argesh.

01:07:50.764 --> 01:07:52.764
River princess.

01:09:28.862 --> 01:09:30.296
Dear Madam.

01:09:30.397 --> 01:09:33.332
Your fiancé is safe and in the care...

01:09:33.433 --> 01:09:37.273
...of the good sisters of the Blessed Sacrament.

01:09:37.504 --> 01:09:41.804
Mr. Harker believes your life is in extreme danger...

01:09:42.009 --> 01:09:45.444
...and he desires with all urgency that you join him here...

01:09:45.545 --> 01:09:48.715
...so that you may immediately be married.

01:09:48.814 --> 01:09:52.410
Yours with all blessings,
Sister Agatha.

01:09:55.589 --> 01:09:57.716
My sweet prince.

01:09:57.924 --> 01:10:00.518
Jonathan must never know of us.

01:10:11.571 --> 01:10:13.006
Dr. Van Helsing.

01:10:13.106 --> 01:10:16.310
And you're Madam Mina,
dear friend to our Lucy, ja?

01:10:16.410 --> 01:10:19.646
How is she, doctor?
- She's still very weak.

01:10:19.746 --> 01:10:22.049
She tells me of your beloved Jonathan Harker...

01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:24.229
...and your worry for him.

01:10:24.418 --> 01:10:27.698
Well, I, too, worry for all young lovers.

01:10:31.124 --> 01:10:33.760
There are darknesses in life,
my child...

01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:35.885
...and there are lights.

01:10:36.096 --> 01:10:38.932
You are one of the lights,
dear Mina...

01:10:39.032 --> 01:10:41.112
...the light of all light.

01:10:46.606 --> 01:10:48.606
Go now.
See your friend.

01:11:09.696 --> 01:11:12.062
You look different.

01:11:12.265 --> 01:11:15.325
You look positively radiant.

01:11:15.535 --> 01:11:17.037
You heard from Jonathan.

01:11:17.137 --> 01:11:19.264
Didn't you?
- Yes.

01:11:20.941 --> 01:11:22.941
He's safe.

01:11:23.143 --> 01:11:25.771
He's in a convent in Romania.

01:11:25.979 --> 01:11:29.346
He's suffering from a violent brain fever.

01:11:29.549 --> 01:11:31.285
The good sisters are caring for him.

01:11:31.385 --> 01:11:35.913
They wrote to me,
and they say he needs me...

01:11:36.123 --> 01:11:39.115
...but I won't go.

01:11:39.326 --> 01:11:41.521
I'm not going to leave you.

01:11:43.897 --> 01:11:46.297
You've got to go to him...

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:49.060
...and you've got to love him...

01:11:49.169 --> 01:11:52.209
...and marry him right then and there.

01:11:52.639 --> 01:11:56.405
And I want you to take this,
my sister.

01:11:56.610 --> 01:11:58.850
It's my wedding gift to you.

01:12:00.614 --> 01:12:03.654
Don't worry about spoiled little Lucy.

01:12:05.385 --> 01:12:07.751
I'll be all right.

01:12:08.422 --> 01:12:10.913
Tell Jonathan oceans of love.

01:12:25.906 --> 01:12:27.906
Jack, how is she?

01:12:46.626 --> 01:12:49.459
This is why I cannot breathe.

01:12:49.663 --> 01:12:51.663
Lucy, it's medicinal.

01:12:51.747 --> 01:12:54.067
To help you sleep.
To dream better dreams.

01:12:54.167 --> 01:12:57.237
It's garlic.
It's nothing but common garlic.

01:12:57.337 --> 01:13:00.697
Quincey's here to see you.
Get some brandy.

01:13:00.769 --> 01:13:04.369
Now, Miss Lucy,
you just rest easy.

01:13:04.578 --> 01:13:07.378
Arthur sent me to take care of you.

01:13:07.614 --> 01:13:09.049
He said if you don't get better quick...

01:13:09.149 --> 01:13:13.789
...I have to put you out of your misery like a lame horse.

01:13:15.155 --> 01:13:17.555
You're such a beast.

01:13:20.894 --> 01:13:22.894
Will you kiss me?

01:13:25.899 --> 01:13:28.299
Kiss me.

01:13:35.842 --> 01:13:39.710
That old coot.
- Get off me.

01:13:39.913 --> 01:13:43.280
Listen to me.
Sleep, sleep now. Sleep.

01:13:46.419 --> 01:13:48.419
You're at peace.

01:13:48.588 --> 01:13:52.354
Look. There. There.

01:13:56.029 --> 01:13:58.029
Nosferatu.

01:14:11.278 --> 01:14:13.914
'Here occurs the shocking and frightening history...

01:14:14.014 --> 01:14:17.882
...of the wild,
berserk Prince Dracula.

01:14:18.084 --> 01:14:20.387
How he impaled people and roasted them...

01:14:20.487 --> 01:14:22.122
...boiled their heads in a kettle...

01:14:22.222 --> 01:14:24.558
...how he skinned them alive...

01:14:24.658 --> 01:14:29.218
...and hacked them to pieces and then drank their blood.'

01:14:32.666 --> 01:14:34.896
Dracul.

01:14:35.101 --> 01:14:37.592
For blood is the life.

01:14:52.452 --> 01:14:56.684
'My dearest Prince, forgive me.

01:14:56.890 --> 01:15:00.494
I have received word from my fiancé in Romania.

01:15:00.594 --> 01:15:04.354
I am en route to join him.
We are to be married.

01:15:04.798 --> 01:15:07.289
I will never see you again.

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.500
Mina. ”

01:15:18.945 --> 01:15:21.345
It is odd,
but I feel almost...

01:15:21.413 --> 01:15:24.050
...that my strange friend is with me.

01:15:24.150 --> 01:15:26.948
He speaks to me in my thoughts.

01:15:27.153 --> 01:15:30.257
With him I felt more alive than ever I had.

01:15:30.357 --> 01:15:33.293
And now without him,
soon to be a bride...

01:15:33.393 --> 01:15:36.055
...I feel confused and lost.

01:15:36.262 --> 01:15:40.221
Perhaps, though I try to be good,
I am bad.

01:15:40.433 --> 01:15:43.368
Perhaps I am a bad,
inconstant woman.

01:16:01.588 --> 01:16:03.818
Winds.

01:16:14.801 --> 01:16:16.894
It is the cause.

01:16:17.103 --> 01:16:19.731
It is the cause of my soul.

01:16:19.939 --> 01:16:21.374
It is Dracula...

01:16:21.474 --> 01:16:23.533
...the undead...

01:16:23.743 --> 01:16:26.783
...the foe I have pursued all my life.

01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:32.750
Dracula.

01:16:35.455 --> 01:16:38.335
Jack, hurry.
I have much to tell you.

01:16:40.427 --> 01:16:42.362
Guard her well, Mr. Morris.

01:16:42.462 --> 01:16:44.828
Do not fail here tonight.

01:16:45.031 --> 01:16:48.034
We are dealing with forces beyond all human experience...

01:16:48.134 --> 01:16:50.203
...an enormous power,
so guard her well.

01:16:50.303 --> 01:16:53.974
Otherwise your precious Lucy will become a bitch of the devil...

01:16:54.074 --> 01:16:56.074
...a whore of darkness.

01:16:57.944 --> 01:17:00.024
You're a sick old buzzard.

01:17:01.047 --> 01:17:03.047
Hear me out, young man.

01:17:03.132 --> 01:17:05.585
Lucy is not a random victim attacked by mere accident.

01:17:05.685 --> 01:17:07.320
Do you understand? No.

01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:11.591
She is a willing recruit,
a breathless, wanton follower.

01:17:11.691 --> 01:17:14.171
I dare say, a devoted disciple.

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:16.794
She is the devil's concubine.

01:17:18.598 --> 01:17:20.598
Do you understand me?

01:17:20.967 --> 01:17:24.698
Yet, we may still save her precious soul.

01:17:24.904 --> 01:17:28.533
But not on an empty stomach.

01:17:28.742 --> 01:17:30.903
Jack.
- Here, sir.

01:17:31.111 --> 01:17:33.807
I starve. Feed me.

01:17:34.914 --> 01:17:36.914
You old coot.

01:19:51.451 --> 01:19:54.721
Your impotent men with their foolish spells...

01:19:54.821 --> 01:19:58.882
...cannot protect you from my power.

01:20:11.337 --> 01:20:14.773
I condemn you to living death...

01:20:14.974 --> 01:20:18.068
...to eternal hunger...

01:20:18.278 --> 01:20:22.510
...for living blood.

01:21:56.075 --> 01:22:00.113
I know how deeply you loved her. That
is why you must trust me and believe.

01:22:00.213 --> 01:22:02.306
Believe?
How can I believe?

01:22:02.515 --> 01:22:06.286
I want you to bring me, before nightfall, a set of postmortem knives.

01:22:06.386 --> 01:22:08.386
An autopsy? Lucy?

01:22:08.554 --> 01:22:14.314
No, not exactly. I just want to cut
off her head and take out her heart.

01:22:20.099 --> 01:22:22.932
Diary, 17th September.

01:22:23.136 --> 01:22:26.697
Poor Jonathan.
He's still so ill.

01:22:26.906 --> 01:22:30.209
He's cheered by the familiar streets in London.

01:22:30.309 --> 01:22:34.549
For me, now that Lucy is dead,
it is a sad homecoming.

01:22:35.581 --> 01:22:38.217
It is as if a part of me is dead too...

01:22:38.317 --> 01:22:41.154
...except for the tiny hope that lives in me...

01:22:41.254 --> 01:22:43.790
...that I will again see my prince.

01:22:43.890 --> 01:22:45.890
Is he here?

01:22:45.958 --> 01:22:47.493
Now that I am married...

01:22:47.593 --> 01:22:51.731
...I begin to understand the nature of
my feelings for my strange friend...

01:22:51.831 --> 01:22:54.391
...who is always in my thoughts.

01:23:05.278 --> 01:23:07.303
Jonathan, what is it?

01:23:07.513 --> 01:23:09.513
It is the man himself.

01:23:09.581 --> 01:23:11.676
Look, he's grown young.

01:23:55.294 --> 01:23:59.731
Gentlemen, must we desecrate poor Lucy's grave?

01:23:59.932 --> 01:24:01.932
She died horribly enough.

01:24:04.537 --> 01:24:07.640
If Miss Lucy is dead,
then no wrong can be done to her.

01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:10.231
But if she's not dead...

01:24:10.443 --> 01:24:12.912
What are you saying, man?
That she's been buried alive?

01:24:13.012 --> 01:24:17.972
No. All I say is she is undead.

01:24:18.985 --> 01:24:20.386
Undead.

01:24:20.486 --> 01:24:22.486
This is insane.

01:24:41.507 --> 01:24:43.668
Gentlemen, shall we?

01:24:43.876 --> 01:24:46.811
One, two, three.

01:25:03.696 --> 01:25:05.696
Where is she?

01:25:10.036 --> 01:25:12.937
What have you done with her?

01:25:13.139 --> 01:25:15.308
She lives beyond the grace of God...

01:25:15.408 --> 01:25:17.643
...a wanderer in the outer darkness.

01:25:17.743 --> 01:25:21.611
She is vampyre, nosferatu.

01:25:21.814 --> 01:25:24.817
These creatures do not die like the bee after the first sting...

01:25:24.917 --> 01:25:27.320
...but instead grow strong and become immortal...

01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:30.460
...once infected by another nosferatu.

01:25:35.161 --> 01:25:37.997
So my friends,
we fight not one beast...

01:25:38.097 --> 01:25:41.534
...but legions that go on age after age after age...

01:25:41.634 --> 01:25:44.674
...feeding on the blood of the living.

01:25:49.475 --> 01:25:52.342
Quickly, hide. Now.

01:26:29.348 --> 01:26:32.442
Come to me, Arthur.

01:26:32.652 --> 01:26:35.678
Leave these others and come to me.

01:26:37.690 --> 01:26:40.730
My arms are hungry for you,
my darling.

01:26:40.893 --> 01:26:44.385
Kiss me and caress me...

01:26:44.597 --> 01:26:46.997
...my darling husband, please.

01:26:47.082 --> 01:26:49.802
We wave Christ and His holy blood.

01:26:49.878 --> 01:26:54.118
We are strong in the Lord and the power of His might.

01:26:57.076 --> 01:26:59.316
The power of God is upon us.

01:27:11.057 --> 01:27:13.857
I bring you from shadow into light.

01:27:13.908 --> 01:27:17.108
I cast you out,
the prince of darkness...

01:27:17.128 --> 01:27:19.128
...into hell.

01:27:21.667 --> 01:27:23.769
A moment's courage,
and it is done.

01:27:23.869 --> 01:27:26.669
Take the stake in your left hand...

01:27:27.973 --> 01:27:30.693
...place the point over the heart.

01:27:34.513 --> 01:27:37.473
Then in God's name, strike.
Do it now.

01:27:52.598 --> 01:27:57.592
Eat, feast. You'll need your strength for the dark days ahead.

01:28:00.773 --> 01:28:03.298
Doctor?
- Ja?

01:28:03.509 --> 01:28:05.509
How did Lucy die?

01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:10.280
Well...

01:28:11.250 --> 01:28:12.852
Was she in great pain?

01:28:12.952 --> 01:28:15.655
Ja, she was in great pain.
Then we cut off her head...

01:28:15.755 --> 01:28:18.991
...drove a stake through her heart and
burned it and then she found peace.

01:28:19.091 --> 01:28:22.356
Doctor. Please.

01:28:25.898 --> 01:28:28.059
So, Mr. Harker...

01:28:28.267 --> 01:28:31.387
...I must now ask you,
as your doctor...

01:28:34.039 --> 01:28:35.841
...a sensitive question.

01:28:35.941 --> 01:28:38.511
During your infidelity with those creatures...

01:28:38.611 --> 01:28:40.179
...those demonic women...

01:28:40.279 --> 01:28:44.199
...did you, for one instant,
taste of their blood?

01:28:55.428 --> 01:28:56.529
Good.

01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:59.198
Then you have not infected your blood with the terrible...

01:28:59.298 --> 01:29:02.178
...disease that destroyed poor Lucy.

01:29:10.242 --> 01:29:12.802
Doctor, you must understand.

01:29:14.547 --> 01:29:16.913
I doubted everything...

01:29:17.116 --> 01:29:18.784
...even my mind.

01:29:18.884 --> 01:29:20.884
I was impotent with fear.

01:29:21.086 --> 01:29:23.816
I know.
- But, sir...

01:29:24.023 --> 01:29:27.754
...I know where the bastard sleeps.

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:31.589
I brought him there,
to Carfax Abbey.

01:29:34.366 --> 01:29:37.961
Vampires do exist.

01:29:38.170 --> 01:29:41.307
And this one we fight,
this one we face...

01:29:41.407 --> 01:29:43.976
...has the strength of 20 or more people...

01:29:44.076 --> 01:29:46.145
...and you can testify for that,
Mr. Harker.

01:29:46.245 --> 01:29:49.382
But he can also control the meaner things of life...

01:29:49.482 --> 01:29:51.584
...the bat, the rodent, the wolf.

01:29:51.684 --> 01:29:56.324
He can appear as mist, as vapor,
as fog and vanish at will.

01:29:56.455 --> 01:29:58.524
Now, all these things Dracula can do...

01:29:58.624 --> 01:30:00.326
...but he is not free.

01:30:00.426 --> 01:30:03.829
He must rest in the sacred earth of
his homeland to gain his evil power.

01:30:03.929 --> 01:30:07.833
It is here that we must find him and destroy him utterly.

01:30:07.933 --> 01:30:10.970
I almost feel pity for anything so hunted as this count.

01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:13.710
How can you pity such a creature?

01:30:15.074 --> 01:30:16.509
I'll take Mina to my quarters.

01:30:16.609 --> 01:30:19.009
Good. You'll be safer there.

01:30:21.747 --> 01:30:24.116
Mr. Morris, your bullets will not harm him.

01:30:24.216 --> 01:30:27.620
He must be beheaded.
I suggest you use your big bowie knife.

01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:31.800
Well, I wasn't planning on getting that close, Doc.

01:30:31.879 --> 01:30:33.879
Master.

01:30:50.209 --> 01:30:52.370
Dr. Jack.

01:30:52.578 --> 01:30:55.445
I've been promised eternal life.

01:30:58.150 --> 01:31:00.390
Dr. Seward, who is that man?

01:31:00.586 --> 01:31:03.155
Mr. Renfield. This is no place for you,
Madam Mina.

01:31:03.255 --> 01:31:06.349
Renfield? I must see him.

01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:10.961
Mr. Renfield, behave yourself.

01:31:13.399 --> 01:31:15.399
This is Mrs. Harker.

01:31:17.069 --> 01:31:20.800
Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Renfield.

01:31:21.006 --> 01:31:23.726
It seems I've been rather naughty.

01:31:26.178 --> 01:31:28.178
I know you.

01:31:28.246 --> 01:31:30.966
You're the bride my master covets.

01:31:32.685 --> 01:31:35.313
I have a husband.

01:31:35.521 --> 01:31:37.521
I am Mrs. Harker.

01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:41.188
My master tells me about you.

01:31:42.361 --> 01:31:44.361
What does he tell you?

01:31:44.797 --> 01:31:46.797
That he is coming.

01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:50.180
That he is coming for you.

01:31:51.236 --> 01:31:53.236
Oh, please.

01:31:59.378 --> 01:32:01.378
Don't stay here.

01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:06.376
Get away from these men, please.

01:32:07.786 --> 01:32:12.266
And I pray to God I may never see your sweet face again.

01:32:15.361 --> 01:32:18.241
And may the Lord bless and keep you.

01:32:29.208 --> 01:32:32.871
Master. Master.

01:32:33.078 --> 01:32:35.672
You promised me eternal life...

01:32:36.181 --> 01:32:39.301
...but you give it to the pretty woman.

01:32:39.418 --> 01:32:41.418
Dr. Jack.

01:32:41.587 --> 01:32:43.587
I'm no lunatic man.

01:32:43.689 --> 01:32:46.649
I'm a sane man fighting for his soul.

01:32:46.759 --> 01:32:50.696
My quarters are spare, but I think you will find them comfortable.

01:32:50.796 --> 01:32:52.796
Dr. Jack.

01:32:52.847 --> 01:32:55.887
Water and toiletries at your disposal.

01:32:57.903 --> 01:33:00.383
You'll be completely safe here.

01:34:02.468 --> 01:34:06.068
Destroy every box.
Sterilize the earth inside.

01:34:06.171 --> 01:34:08.171
Leave him no refuge.

01:34:08.407 --> 01:34:10.637
Let the exorcism begin.

01:34:40.072 --> 01:34:43.064
You have betrayed me.

01:34:47.079 --> 01:34:49.079
No, master.

01:34:53.252 --> 01:34:55.482
I serve you.

01:34:55.687 --> 01:34:58.520
I serve only you.

01:35:55.981 --> 01:35:59.075
Oh, yes, my love.

01:35:59.284 --> 01:36:01.650
You've found me.

01:36:04.890 --> 01:36:07.256
My most precious life.

01:36:07.459 --> 01:36:10.485
I have wanted this to happen.

01:36:10.696 --> 01:36:12.696
I know that now.

01:36:14.433 --> 01:36:17.869
I want to be with you always.

01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:22.564
You cannot know what you are saying.

01:36:22.774 --> 01:36:24.774
Yes...

01:36:24.910 --> 01:36:26.969
...I do know.

01:36:39.892 --> 01:36:43.885
I feared I would never feel your touch again.

01:36:44.096 --> 01:36:46.096
I thought you were dead.

01:36:53.171 --> 01:36:57.198
There is no life in this body.

01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:03.380
But you live.

01:37:05.050 --> 01:37:07.050
You live.

01:37:08.654 --> 01:37:10.654
What are you?

01:37:11.890 --> 01:37:14.984
I must know.
You must tell me.

01:37:22.334 --> 01:37:24.334
I am...

01:37:25.671 --> 01:37:27.935
...nothing.

01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:30.140
Lifeless.

01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:33.645
Soulless.
- What do you mean?

01:37:33.745 --> 01:37:36.612
Hated and feared.

01:37:37.849 --> 01:37:40.784
I am dead to all the world.

01:37:40.986 --> 01:37:42.986
Hear me.

01:37:44.856 --> 01:37:46.881
I am the monster...

01:37:47.092 --> 01:37:49.732
...that breathing men would kill.

01:37:50.529 --> 01:37:53.089
I am Dracula.

01:38:08.914 --> 01:38:11.041
You murdered Lucy.

01:38:24.262 --> 01:38:26.262
I love you.

01:38:27.532 --> 01:38:31.901
Oh, God, forgive me, I do.

01:38:50.522 --> 01:38:53.116
I want to be what you are...

01:38:53.325 --> 01:38:54.726
...see what you see...

01:38:54.826 --> 01:38:56.826
...love what you love.

01:39:00.365 --> 01:39:02.856
To walk with me...

01:39:03.068 --> 01:39:06.348
...you must die to your breathing life...

01:39:06.443 --> 01:39:09.532
...and be reborn to mine.

01:39:09.741 --> 01:39:12.904
You are my love...

01:39:13.111 --> 01:39:15.705
...and my life always.

01:39:23.722 --> 01:39:25.524
Then...

01:39:25.624 --> 01:39:27.990
...I give you life eternal...

01:39:29.795 --> 01:39:31.795
...everlasting love...

01:39:33.365 --> 01:39:37.131
...the power of the storm...

01:39:37.335 --> 01:39:40.930
...and the beasts of the earth.

01:39:41.139 --> 01:39:43.266
Walk with me...

01:39:43.475 --> 01:39:47.138
...to be my loving wife forever.

01:39:47.345 --> 01:39:50.075
I will. Yes. Yes.

01:40:21.179 --> 01:40:24.080
Drink and join me...

01:40:25.183 --> 01:40:27.617
...in eternal life.

01:40:42.901 --> 01:40:44.901
I cannot let this be.

01:40:46.004 --> 01:40:49.269
Please, I don't care.
Make me yours.

01:40:49.474 --> 01:40:53.578
You will be cursed as I am to walk in the shadow of death...

01:40:53.678 --> 01:40:55.480
...for all eternity.

01:40:55.580 --> 01:41:00.279
I love you too much...

01:41:00.485 --> 01:41:01.953
...to condemn you.

01:41:02.053 --> 01:41:07.150
Then take me away from all this death.

01:42:04.449 --> 01:42:07.714
You think you can destroy me...

01:42:07.919 --> 01:42:10.217
...with your idols?

01:42:13.225 --> 01:42:15.819
Sacred blood of Christ.

01:42:16.027 --> 01:42:18.894
I, who served the cross.

01:42:19.097 --> 01:42:21.395
I, who commanded nations...

01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:24.669
...hundreds of years before you were born.

01:42:24.769 --> 01:42:26.849
Your armies were defeated.

01:42:26.944 --> 01:42:30.806
You tortured and impaled thousands of people.

01:42:31.009 --> 01:42:34.103
I was betrayed.

01:42:34.312 --> 01:42:37.213
Look what your God...

01:42:37.415 --> 01:42:40.111
...has done to me.

01:42:40.318 --> 01:42:45.038
No, your war with God is over.
You must pay for your crimes.

01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:50.095
Christ compels you.

01:42:50.195 --> 01:42:53.653
She is now...

01:42:53.865 --> 01:42:57.096
...my bride.

01:43:01.806 --> 01:43:03.806
More light.

01:43:04.876 --> 01:43:08.175
Light. More light.

01:43:15.887 --> 01:43:17.887
Unclean.

01:43:20.258 --> 01:43:21.426
Get them.
- This way.

01:43:21.526 --> 01:43:23.094
Get them.
- They must be found.

01:43:23.194 --> 01:43:24.262
Unclean.

01:43:24.362 --> 01:43:26.842
We have learned something much.

01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:30.595
Dracula fears us.
He fears time.

01:43:30.802 --> 01:43:33.862
For, if not,
why does he hurry so?

01:43:34.072 --> 01:43:36.768
He is gone.

01:43:36.975 --> 01:43:39.205
How do you know?

01:43:39.411 --> 01:43:42.141
He speaks to me.

01:43:43.281 --> 01:43:46.401
He has a strong mind connection to you.

01:43:47.819 --> 01:43:51.739
His heart was strong enough to survive the grave.

01:43:52.023 --> 01:43:55.083
You admire him.
- Ja.

01:43:55.293 --> 01:43:59.525
He was, in life,
a most remarkable man...

01:43:59.731 --> 01:44:02.500
...and his mind was great and powerful...

01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:05.604
...but greater is the necessity to stamp him out...

01:44:05.704 --> 01:44:07.864
...and destroy him utterly.

01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:10.740
Doctor?
- Ja?

01:44:13.712 --> 01:44:17.341
I know that I am becoming like him.

01:44:17.549 --> 01:44:20.916
Your salvation is his destruction.

01:44:21.119 --> 01:44:24.782
That is why I want to hypnotize you.

01:44:24.989 --> 01:44:29.027
I want you to help me find him before it is too late.

01:44:29.127 --> 01:44:32.585
Please, help me find him.
Please.

01:44:32.797 --> 01:44:35.129
Look into this light...

01:44:35.333 --> 01:44:38.693
...the light of all light,
into this flame.

01:44:39.104 --> 01:44:41.104
Your eyes are heavy.

01:44:42.707 --> 01:44:45.369
You want to sleep.
Sleep now.

01:44:48.413 --> 01:44:52.179
Sleep.
- I must go to him.

01:44:52.384 --> 01:44:54.682
He calls.

01:44:54.886 --> 01:44:56.886
What do you hear?

01:44:58.623 --> 01:45:01.023
What do you hear, child?

01:45:02.127 --> 01:45:04.721
What do you hear?

01:45:04.929 --> 01:45:08.956
Oh, my prince is calling me.

01:45:09.167 --> 01:45:13.661
He is traveling across icy seas to his beloved home.

01:45:13.872 --> 01:45:16.932
There he will grow strong again.

01:45:17.142 --> 01:45:20.822
I am coming to him to partake of his strength.

01:45:26.284 --> 01:45:31.189
We left London by train and crossed
the English Channel in stormy seas...

01:45:31.289 --> 01:45:34.392
...no doubt from the passage of the count's ship.

01:45:34.492 --> 01:45:38.861
He commands the winds,
but we still have the advantage.

01:45:39.063 --> 01:45:42.734
By train, we can reach the Romanian port at Varna in three days.

01:45:42.834 --> 01:45:46.194
By ship, it will take him at least a week.

01:45:47.005 --> 01:45:50.108
From Paris, we traveled through the Alps to Budapest.

01:45:50.208 --> 01:45:52.844
The count must sail around the Rock of Gibraltar...

01:45:52.944 --> 01:45:54.746
...where we have posted a lookout...

01:45:54.846 --> 01:45:57.682
...and then on to the Black Sea port in Varna...

01:45:57.782 --> 01:46:02.262
...where we will meet his ship and burn it into the sea.

01:46:07.158 --> 01:46:10.252
Home. Home.

01:46:20.071 --> 01:46:22.841
The vampire's baptized her with his own blood...

01:46:22.941 --> 01:46:25.076
...and her blood is dying,
my friend.

01:46:25.176 --> 01:46:27.176
It is no use.

01:46:39.491 --> 01:46:42.794
I will not let you go into the unknown alone.

01:46:42.894 --> 01:46:47.092
Oh, my poor, dear Jonathan.

01:46:47.298 --> 01:46:49.960
Oh, what have I done to you?

01:46:51.703 --> 01:46:54.831
No, I have done this to both of us.

01:46:55.039 --> 01:46:57.308
I can hear him.
He's coming closer.

01:46:57.408 --> 01:46:59.408
He's calling me to him.

01:47:04.082 --> 01:47:06.448
Stay with me. Please.

01:47:06.651 --> 01:47:08.651
I am so cold.

01:47:20.865 --> 01:47:22.300
All aboard.

01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:26.137
Noon. Holmwood received a wire from his clerk at Lloyd's.

01:47:26.237 --> 01:47:29.307
The count's ship sailed past us in the night fog...

01:47:29.407 --> 01:47:31.309
...to the northern port of Galatz.

01:47:31.409 --> 01:47:34.537
The black devil is reading Mina's mind.

01:47:34.746 --> 01:47:37.214
How can we catch him now?

01:47:45.223 --> 01:47:47.623
Varna. Galatz.

01:47:47.825 --> 01:47:49.527
It's about 200 miles.

01:47:49.627 --> 01:47:51.863
I think that with the horses,
we can cut him off...

01:47:51.963 --> 01:47:53.898
...reach him before he reaches the castle.

01:47:53.998 --> 01:47:57.035
I will dispatch Van Helsing straight for the Borgo Pass.

01:47:57.135 --> 01:47:58.703
If we fail in our task...

01:47:58.803 --> 01:48:01.283
...you will have to finish him.

01:48:05.577 --> 01:48:08.913
From Varna, Mina and Van Helsing took a carriage...

01:48:09.013 --> 01:48:11.783
...and we continued on the train towards Galatz...

01:48:11.883 --> 01:48:15.753
...where we still hoped to intercept the count before he reaches land.

01:48:15.853 --> 01:48:20.552
I am fearful for Mina.
She is now our decoy.

01:48:33.037 --> 01:48:34.873
I know this place.

01:48:34.973 --> 01:48:37.742
The end of the world.
- We must go on.

01:48:37.842 --> 01:48:39.744
It is late, child.
We must rest here now.

01:48:39.844 --> 01:48:42.278
No, we must go.

01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:44.480
He needs me.
We must go.

01:48:48.620 --> 01:48:50.620
We have passed Bistritza.

01:48:50.688 --> 01:48:53.283
Dracula has outsmarted us again.

01:48:53.491 --> 01:48:57.295
We learned that his gypsies took charge
of the vampire's box at Galatz...

01:48:57.395 --> 01:49:00.922
...and are now on the Borgo Pass road.

01:49:16.881 --> 01:49:20.317
Here. You must eat.
- I am not hungry.

01:50:12.537 --> 01:50:15.577
You have been so good to me,
Professor.

01:50:25.116 --> 01:50:29.036
I know that Lucy harbored secret desires for you.

01:50:29.153 --> 01:50:31.485
She told me.

01:50:31.689 --> 01:50:34.681
I, too, know what men desire.

01:50:51.375 --> 01:50:53.311
Will you cut off my head...

01:50:53.411 --> 01:50:55.380
...and drive a stake through my heart...

01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:59.160
...as you did poor Lucy,
you murdering bastard?

01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:06.360
Not while I live.
I am sworn to protect you.

01:51:23.141 --> 01:51:25.621
You are safe within the circle.

01:51:25.743 --> 01:51:29.201
I've lost Lucy.
I'll not lose you to him.

01:51:29.413 --> 01:51:31.413
You're whores of Satan.

01:51:35.019 --> 01:51:37.019
This is holy ground.

01:51:37.155 --> 01:51:39.155
Leave this place now.

01:51:40.992 --> 01:51:42.992
Leave.

01:51:43.694 --> 01:51:46.497
In the name of God,
leave this ground.

01:51:46.597 --> 01:51:49.477
I command you in the name of Christ.

01:52:00.545 --> 01:52:03.446
Christ. Damn you.

01:52:40.618 --> 01:52:42.618
Dracul.

01:53:21.325 --> 01:53:23.325
You are...

01:53:23.527 --> 01:53:25.791
...near.

01:53:25.997 --> 01:53:27.997
My love.

01:53:40.011 --> 01:53:41.445
They're racing against the sunset.

01:53:41.545 --> 01:53:44.025
It may be too late.
God help us.

01:54:24.956 --> 01:54:26.956
Harker, shoot.

01:54:35.099 --> 01:54:37.099
Charge.

01:57:18.462 --> 01:57:22.142
When my time comes,
will you do the same to me?

01:57:24.268 --> 01:57:26.268
Will you?

01:57:31.842 --> 01:57:33.344
Wait.
- Let them go.

01:57:33.444 --> 01:57:37.244
Let them go.
Our work is finished here.

01:57:38.048 --> 01:57:40.048
Hers has just begun.

01:58:03.874 --> 01:58:06.570
We've all become God's madmen.

01:58:09.079 --> 01:58:11.079
All of us.

01:58:20.291 --> 01:58:24.022
Where is my God?

01:58:24.228 --> 01:58:27.391
He has forsaken me.

01:58:33.671 --> 01:58:36.902
It is finished.

01:58:38.976 --> 01:58:40.976
My love.

01:58:45.249 --> 01:58:47.249
My love.

01:58:54.925 --> 01:58:57.485
There, in the presence of God...

01:58:57.557 --> 01:59:00.498
...I understood at last how my love could release us all...

01:59:00.598 --> 01:59:03.078
...from the powers of darkness.

01:59:08.806 --> 01:59:11.366
Our love is stronger than death.

01:59:19.617 --> 01:59:22.484
Give me peace.
