24:03.504 --> 24:04.839

24:04.922 --> 24:07.717
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T.

24:10.303 --> 24:14.349

24:35.828 --> 24:38.373
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

24:38.456 --> 24:40.500
Use only the letters from
"He lies still" and leave the rest...

24:40.583 --> 24:41.751
Blank. Yeah, I understand.

24:41.834 --> 24:43.961
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

50:52.864 --> 50:54.073
How you been?

50:56.409 --> 50:58.119
Yeah, I've been okay.

50:59.454 --> 51:00.830
<i>I was just...</i>

51:02.874 --> 51:04.709
I was just headed back upstairs.

51:05.460 --> 51:06.461
Well...

51:07.545 --> 51:09.213
<i>don't be a stranger.</i>

51:23.311 --> 51:25.688
-You know Carmine Falcone.
-I told you it's a mob spot.

51:25.772 --> 51:27.357
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

51:27.440 --> 51:29.233
<i>I don't have</i>
<i>a relationship with him, okay?</i>

51:29.317 --> 51:31.152
-Well, that's not what it looked like.
<i>-Forget it.</i>

51:31.235 --> 51:32.320
Wait, what are you doing?

51:32.403 --> 51:34.822
<i>-Listen, I can't do this anymore.</i>
-No! No!

51:44.374 --> 51:45.375
[Gil] Hey!

51:47.085 --> 51:48.169
I lost you in there.

51:48.252 --> 51:49.337
Yeah, I gotta go.

51:50.213 --> 51:51.631
Oh, you need a ride?

51:52.340 --> 51:53.633
That's me right there.

51:59.722 --> 52:00.807

52:00.890 --> 52:02.016
I'm good.

52:03.726 --> 52:05.144
I hope, uh...

52:09.732 --> 52:11.150
I'll see you around.

54:39.966 --> 54:40.883
[Batman] What do you know about

54:40.967 --> 54:43.261
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

54:46.347 --> 54:48.057
Yeah, sure, there was.

54:48.766 --> 54:50.601
That's the rat we're looking for.

54:51.519 --> 54:53.396
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

54:53.980 --> 54:56.983
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

54:57.066 --> 54:58.526
Where are you getting this?

54:58.609 --> 55:01.487
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

55:02.280 --> 55:03.740
Gil's very nervous.

55:04.699 --> 55:07.243
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

55:07.326 --> 55:09.203
I worked that case.

55:09.287 --> 55:11.247
Riddler's not after you.

55:11.330 --> 55:12.248
How do you know?

55:12.623 --> 55:14.042
You're not corrupt.

55:15.084 --> 55:16.627
Colson's dirty?

55:22.508 --> 55:24.010
Maybe I, uh...

55:24.677 --> 55:28.014
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

55:28.097 --> 55:31.392
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

55:32.143 --> 55:33.936
Who knows how many people it touches.

55:34.020 --> 55:37.231
Politicians. Police. The courts.

55:38.524 --> 55:40.234
It could tear the whole city apart.

55:40.651 --> 55:42.695
[Gordon] Jesus, this is a powder keg.

55:44.322 --> 55:46.074
[Batman] And Riddler's the match.

55:46.949 --> 55:48.117
[Batman on video]

-[Alfred] Pretty.
-[tape clicks off]

56:07.637 --> 56:09.013
She a new friend of yours?

56:13.601 --> 56:14.811
I'm not so sure.

56:15.645 --> 56:17.146
Looks like you upset her.

56:18.314 --> 56:20.441
Shall I take this as a good sign?

56:20.525 --> 56:21.526
What?

56:21.609 --> 56:22.527
Your attire.

56:22.610 --> 56:24.737
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

56:24.821 --> 56:26.823
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

56:26.906 --> 56:29.575
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

56:30.618 --> 56:32.203
Riddler might not be able to resist.

56:32.286 --> 56:33.746
Oh, that reminds me.

56:34.914 --> 56:38.876
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

56:39.419 --> 56:40.920
The one from the rat maze.

56:41.337 --> 56:44.424
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

56:44.757 --> 56:46.634
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

56:46.718 --> 56:49.971
"You are <i>El Rata Alada."</i>

56:50.596 --> 56:52.015
[Bruce] <i>Rata Alada?</i>

56:52.098 --> 56:53.307
"Rat with wings"?

56:53.391 --> 56:55.893
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

56:55.977 --> 56:57.228
Yeah.

56:58.688 --> 56:59.814
A stool pigeon.

57:00.064 --> 57:01.691
Where are your cufflinks?

57:01.774 --> 57:02.734
I couldn't find them.

57:04.193 --> 57:06.154
Well, you can't go out like that.

57:06.237 --> 57:08.031
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

57:12.201 --> 57:14.996
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.

57:15.079 --> 57:16.080
[scoffs]

57:16.706 --> 57:18.916
And what about you? Are you a Wayne?

57:19.917 --> 57:21.711
Your father gave them to me.

you're going straight down there.

59:05.773 --> 59:07.775
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

59:08.735 --> 59:10.570
Hey, watch it, fellas.

59:11.029 --> 59:13.322
You got the prince of the city there.

59:16.159 --> 59:17.994
Some event, huh?

59:18.077 --> 59:21.039
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

59:21.122 --> 59:23.583
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

59:23.666 --> 59:25.293
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

59:25.376 --> 59:27.378
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

59:28.254 --> 59:29.672
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

59:30.298 --> 59:31.758
Wow. Is that right?

59:31.841 --> 59:33.885
His father saved my life.

59:34.844 --> 59:38.056
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

59:39.265 --> 59:42.769
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

59:43.061 --> 59:46.272
Operated right on the dining room table.

59:46.356 --> 59:51.611
Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.

59:53.029 --> 59:55.031
I remember your face.

59:57.033 --> 59:58.993
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

59:59.369 --> 1:00:01.496
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

1:00:02.830 --> 1:00:04.415
"Hippocratic oath."

1:00:06.959 --> 1:00:08.169
That's good.

1:00:08.711 --> 1:00:09.879

Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it, I can tell you that.

1:00:53.673 --> 1:00:56.884
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.

I wouldn't be bothering you here,

but your people keep telling me
you're unavailable.

you're not doing anything.

We don't know if he's in on it.

Holy shit.

1:05:10.096 --> 1:05:11.764
[Mackenzie] Are you kidding me?

1:05:11.848 --> 1:05:14.600
What the hell is he doing? Gordon!

1:05:15.435 --> 1:05:17.895

1:05:33.661 --> 1:05:34.871
Please.

1:05:35.038 --> 1:05:37.790
He made me do it.
[tearfully] I'm so sorry.

1:05:38.207 --> 1:05:40.418
He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.

1:05:40.501 --> 1:05:41.502
I'm so sorry.

1:05:42.003 --> 1:05:43.671
Looks like a combination lock.

1:05:43.755 --> 1:05:45.214
Can't we just cut it off?

1:05:45.965 --> 1:05:47.633
Not if you want to keep your head.

"Unmask"?

1:06:44.023 --> 1:06:45.191
<i>Yes.</i>

1:06:46.025 --> 1:06:48.861
<i>Let's do it together, okay?</i>

1:06:48.945 --> 1:06:51.364
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

1:06:52.031 --> 1:06:54.367

1:06:54.450 --> 1:06:56.244
How am I a part of this?

1:06:56.327 --> 1:06:58.246
<i>You'll see.</i>

1:06:58.329 --> 1:07:00.081
[officer] Hey, Chief.
You better take a look at this.

1:07:00.164 --> 1:07:02.250
[Riddler on stream]
<i>Say hello to my followers.</i>

1:07:02.333 --> 1:07:03.584

This psycho's gonna kill me!

<i>No one ever gave me a chance.</i>

1:07:40.955 --> 1:07:41.998

<i>from the horrors of our world.</i>

1:07:55.970 --> 1:08:01.184

1:08:01.267 --> 1:08:03.519
-You want me to do puzzles?
-[chuckles excitedly]

Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?

1:08:29.879 --> 1:08:30.963
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

1:08:31.047 --> 1:08:32.465
-"Justice."
-Huh?

1:08:32.548 --> 1:08:33.591
The answer's "justice."

1:08:33.675 --> 1:08:34.884
-Justice?
<i>-Yes!</i>

1:08:34.967 --> 1:08:36.552

<i>were you not, Mr. Colson?</i>

1:08:45.978 --> 1:08:47.188
Of course, of course. Of course.

<i>Riddle number two.</i>

Oh, God. "Bribes"?

1:09:01.411 --> 1:09:03.579
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.

-How much?
-Nothing!

1:09:07.542 --> 1:09:09.752
-[raises voice] How much?
-Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

1:09:09.836 --> 1:09:12.130
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.

1:09:12.213 --> 1:09:13.047
What cases?

1:09:13.131 --> 1:09:14.257

I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

If I go out this way, it's just me.

I have family, people I love.

I'll get him to cooperate.

1:11:55.793 --> 1:11:57.295
Okay, give him the room.

That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

1:13:02.777 --> 1:13:05.697
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

1:13:06.614 --> 1:13:09.242
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

1:13:11.953 --> 1:13:13.913
Or he moonlights as a cop.

I did.

1:14:51.469 --> 1:14:54.847
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

1:14:57.058 --> 1:14:58.184
I only trust you.

1:14:58.267 --> 1:15:00.603
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

1:15:00.687 --> 1:15:04.065
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

1:15:04.816 --> 1:15:05.942
You think Penguin's the rat?

1:15:06.025 --> 1:15:09.070
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

1:15:09.153 --> 1:15:11.114
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

1:15:11.197 --> 1:15:12.532
DA was a regular too.

1:15:12.615 --> 1:15:16.119
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

The <i>Rata Alada.</i>

1:15:18.496 --> 1:15:19.455

1:15:19.539 --> 1:15:20.998
Riddler's latest.

1:15:21.082 --> 1:15:22.792
The cipher in the maze.

1:15:22.875 --> 1:15:25.378
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

1:15:26.963 --> 1:15:28.589
A penguin's got wings too.

1:15:30.591 --> 1:15:32.552
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

1:15:32.635 --> 1:15:34.303
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

1:15:34.387 --> 1:15:37.598
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

So you gave up a bigger fish

the mayor, the DA,

they got greedy, right?
Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.

Found out from Mitchell that you were
the rat, so you killed her.

1:25:43.329 --> 1:25:45.289

would do to me

1:45:20.423 --> 1:45:22.800
what even a good man like him

1:45:22.884 --> 1:45:25.470
is capable of in the right situation.

1:45:27.722 --> 1:45:29.182
Do me a favor.

1:45:29.515 --> 1:45:31.559
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1:45:32.268 --> 1:45:33.853
This reporter

1:45:34.687 --> 1:45:36.272
was a lowlife.

1:45:36.356 --> 1:45:37.815
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1:45:39.442 --> 1:45:41.069
-Maroni?
-Oh, yeah.

1:45:41.819 --> 1:45:45.073
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1:45:46.491 --> 1:45:49.994
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried

1:45:50.078 --> 1:45:52.413
that your father would be in my pocket,

1:45:53.164 --> 1:45:54.165
forever.

1:45:54.832 --> 1:45:56.876
He would have done anything

1:45:56.959 --> 1:45:59.128
to keep him from becoming mayor.

1:45:59.212 --> 1:46:00.546
You understand?

1:46:01.756 --> 1:46:06.302
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1:46:06.386 --> 1:46:08.429
Do I know it for a fact?

1:46:10.848 --> 1:46:12.934
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1:46:14.310 --> 1:46:16.604
This is what you wanted, huh?

1:46:16.688 --> 1:46:19.107
This little conversation here?

1:46:19.607 --> 1:46:21.025
[exhales ruefully]

1:46:21.526 --> 1:46:23.695
It's been a long time coming, huh?

1:46:26.322 --> 1:46:28.449
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

1:46:31.911 --> 1:46:33.996
[melancholy music playing]

1:47:18.124 --> 1:47:20.084
[EKG machine beeping]

1:47:23.546 --> 1:47:25.214
[inhales sharply]

1:47:30.470 --> 1:47:32.221
[rain pattering]

1:47:35.016 --> 1:47:36.100
[sighs]

1:47:37.852 --> 1:47:39.145
You lied to me...

1:47:41.981 --> 1:47:43.608
my whole life.

1:47:48.780 --> 1:47:50.823
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1:47:53.910 --> 1:47:57.205
He told me what he did for my father.

1:48:01.209 --> 1:48:02.710
About Salvatore Maroni.

1:48:04.712 --> 1:48:07.423
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

1:48:07.507 --> 1:48:09.258
Had my father killed.

1:48:11.719 --> 1:48:13.930
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1:48:16.683 --> 1:48:21.229
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1:48:21.312 --> 1:48:23.648
believing that he was a good man.

1:48:23.731 --> 1:48:25.316
He was a good man.

1:48:26.484 --> 1:48:28.194
You listen to me.

1:48:28.277 --> 1:48:31.698
Your father was a good man.

1:48:35.326 --> 1:48:37.245
-He made a mistake.
-A "mistake."

1:48:37.328 --> 1:48:39.247
He had a man killed.

1:48:39.330 --> 1:48:40.415
Why?

1:48:41.582 --> 1:48:44.836
[sighing] To protect his family image?

1:48:45.920 --> 1:48:47.171
His political aspirations?

1:48:47.255 --> 1:48:50.800
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1:48:53.386 --> 1:48:54.929
He was protecting your mother.

1:48:55.888 --> 1:48:59.434
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1:48:59.517 --> 1:49:01.644
He cared about her,

1:49:01.728 --> 1:49:03.021
and you,

1:49:03.104 --> 1:49:06.024
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1:49:06.107 --> 1:49:09.569
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1:49:10.445 --> 1:49:13.781
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

1:49:13.865 --> 1:49:16.993
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

1:49:17.076 --> 1:49:18.911
That's who Falcone is.

1:49:21.164 --> 1:49:23.374
And that was your father's mistake.

1:49:23.458 --> 1:49:25.501
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1:49:25.585 --> 1:49:28.338
your father was distraught.

1:49:29.213 --> 1:49:32.425
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1:49:32.508 --> 1:49:34.677
that he would confess everything.

1:49:36.179 --> 1:49:38.181
And that night,

1:49:38.264 --> 1:49:42.185
your father and your mother were killed.

1:49:44.604 --> 1:49:46.773
[soft music playing]

1:49:47.690 --> 1:49:49.442
It was Falcone?

1:49:53.946 --> 1:49:55.406
[smacks lips]

1:49:55.490 --> 1:49:57.617
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1:50:02.330 --> 1:50:05.875
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

1:50:05.958 --> 1:50:08.711
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1:50:08.795 --> 1:50:14.008
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

1:50:15.760 --> 1:50:19.639
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1:50:20.306 --> 1:50:22.100
I know you always blamed yourself.

1:50:22.183 --> 1:50:24.727
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1:50:26.896 --> 1:50:29.190
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1:50:30.608 --> 1:50:32.985
but I didn't know how to help.

1:50:33.069 --> 1:50:35.571
I could teach you how to fight, [sighs]

1:50:36.948 --> 1:50:39.617
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1:50:39.701 --> 1:50:41.536
You needed a father.

1:50:43.496 --> 1:50:45.915
And all you had was me.

1:50:48.292 --> 1:50:49.502
I'm sorry.

1:50:51.254 --> 1:50:53.172
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1:50:59.971 --> 1:51:01.055
God.

1:51:04.100 --> 1:51:08.521
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1:51:11.232 --> 1:51:13.359
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1:51:19.782 --> 1:51:21.034
I mean,

1:51:22.243 --> 1:51:24.370
I'm not afraid to die.

1:51:26.122 --> 1:51:28.499
I realize now there's something

1:51:29.625 --> 1:51:31.502
I haven't got past.

1:51:32.420 --> 1:51:34.172
This fear...

1:51:36.632 --> 1:51:39.594
of ever going through any of that again.

1:51:43.848 --> 1:51:46.059
Of losing somebody I care about.

1:51:47.393 --> 1:51:49.687

1:52:36.651 --> 1:52:37.610
Hey.

1:52:37.694 --> 1:52:40.446
I saw the signal. That's not you?

1:52:40.530 --> 1:52:42.448
I thought it was you.

1:52:46.619 --> 1:52:47.995
[both grunting]

1:52:55.378 --> 1:52:56.921
-I found him!
-I see that.

1:52:57.005 --> 1:52:58.506
He had my shit and my phone.

1:52:58.589 --> 1:52:59.799
She left a message
the night they took her.

1:52:59.882 --> 1:53:00.800
She called me...

1:53:00.883 --> 1:53:02.593
Gordon! Help me out, man!

1:53:02.677 --> 1:53:03.970
She got my gun!

1:53:05.304 --> 1:53:07.015
-Shut up!
-Put the gun down.

1:53:08.558 --> 1:53:11.102
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1:53:15.690 --> 1:53:17.775
-[cell phone beeps]
-Here. Listen.

<i>Hey, don't be scared. Come here.</i>

1:53:36.210 --> 1:53:38.254
<i>Now let me ask you again.</i>

-[Annika] <i>No, nothing. He...</i>

1:53:41.591 --> 1:53:44.510
[Falcone] <i>Don liked to talk.</i>
<i>I know that.</i>

<i>Especially to pretty girls like you.</i>

1:53:47.847 --> 1:53:49.849

[Falcone] <i>We're gonna get you</i>
<i>out of here, I promise.</i>

1:54:02.487 --> 1:54:05.031
<i>But first, I gotta know...</i>

1:54:06.115 --> 1:54:07.450

<i>they all made a deal with you.</i>

1:54:12.288 --> 1:54:13.498
[Falcone] <i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

1:54:13.581 --> 1:54:15.541
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

1:54:15.625 --> 1:54:16.918
<i>The deal.</i>

1:54:17.001 --> 1:54:21.923
[Annika] <i>He said you gave some</i>
<i>information on some drops thing</i>

1:54:22.006 --> 1:54:24.717
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

1:54:24.801 --> 1:54:27.178

1:54:27.261 --> 1:54:28.388

Falcone is the rat?

Falcone works for you guys?

No.

[breathing shakily]

1:55:31.159 --> 1:55:32.452
We work for him.

1:55:33.453 --> 1:55:34.704
Everybody does.

1:55:34.787 --> 1:55:35.788
How?

1:55:35.872 --> 1:55:37.457
Through Renewal.

1:55:38.249 --> 1:55:39.625
Renewal is everything.

1:55:39.709 --> 1:55:41.044
-The Renewal Fund?
-[Kenzie] Yeah.

1:55:41.627 --> 1:55:45.340
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

1:55:45.423 --> 1:55:49.010
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1:55:49.093 --> 1:55:52.472
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

1:55:52.555 --> 1:55:54.640
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1:55:54.724 --> 1:55:56.434
Everybody got a piece.

1:55:56.517 --> 1:55:58.353
But Falcone wanted more.

1:56:00.146 --> 1:56:03.358
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1:56:04.776 --> 1:56:07.111
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1:56:07.487 --> 1:56:10.198
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1:56:10.281 --> 1:56:12.742
then install them all as his puppets.

1:56:12.825 --> 1:56:15.370
You think this goddamn election matters?

1:56:16.996 --> 1:56:18.915
Falcone's the mayor.

1:56:19.874 --> 1:56:22.377
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1:56:22.460 --> 1:56:23.836
Come on, Vengeance.

1:56:24.545 --> 1:56:26.381

-Oh, God!

1:56:31.094 --> 1:56:32.303
We'll get him.

-But not that way.
-There is no other way!

1:56:34.931 --> 1:56:36.057
He owns the city!

Cross that line...

1:56:38.184 --> 1:56:39.477

She won't get out of there alive.

And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

I'd like to come up?

-Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

I could talk to you for a minute?

you could help me find her...

<i>You wake up screaming</i>
<i>with rats chewing your fingers.</i>

2:17:18.216 --> 2:17:21.386
<i>And every winter one of the babies die</i>

2:18:11.227 --> 2:18:13.688
Your mask is amazing.

I wish you could've seen me in mine.

2:18:16.774 --> 2:18:17.859
Ain't it funny?

-We did.

<i>I mean, I had all the pieces,</i>
<i>I had the answers.</i>

But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

2:19:04.322 --> 2:19:05.531
You gave me that.

2:19:05.615 --> 2:19:06.741
<i>I gave you nothing.</i>

2:19:06.824 --> 2:19:09.410
You showed me what was possible.

<i>You showed me all it takes is fear</i>
<i>and a little focused violence.</i>

<i>You inspired me.</i>

2:19:16.084 --> 2:19:17.585

<i>You're sick, twisted.</i>

<i>How can you say that?</i>

2:19:23.591 --> 2:19:25.093
