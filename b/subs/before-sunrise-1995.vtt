WEBVTT

02:22.769 --> 02:24.687
(speaking German)

02:26.022 --> 02:28.399
(German)

02:37.241 --> 02:40.244
(German continues)

03:03.267 --> 03:06.896
(German continues)

03:26.457 --> 03:29.335
(German continues)

03:43.850 --> 03:48.521
(both arguing)

03:55.445 --> 03:57.447
(door opens)

03:57.530 --> 03:59.240
(door closes)

04:02.744 --> 04:04.912
Do you have any idea
what they were arguing about?

04:06.998 --> 04:08.499
D-Do you speak English?

04:08.583 --> 04:12.545
(French accent) Yeah. No, I'm sorry.
My German is not very good.

04:17.425 --> 04:21.345
Have you heard that as couples get older,
they lose their ability to hear each other?

04:22.305 --> 04:23.973
No.

04:24.056 --> 04:28.186
Well, supposedly, men lose their ability
to hear higher-pitched sounds.

04:28.269 --> 04:31.230
And women eventually
lose hearing on the low end.

04:31.314 --> 04:34.192
- I guess they sort of nullify each other.
- I guess.

04:34.275 --> 04:37.987
Nature's way of allowing couples to grow
old together without killing each other.

04:40.656 --> 04:42.283
What are you reading?

04:43.159 --> 04:44.535
Ah, yeah.

04:45.536 --> 04:48.122
- How about you?
- Um...

04:48.748 --> 04:51.292
- Mmm. (chuckles)
- Hmm.

04:57.673 --> 05:00.635
(man, woman speaking German)

05:04.180 --> 05:07.350
Look, I was thinking about going
to the lounge car sometime soon.

05:07.433 --> 05:10.019
- Would you like to come with me?
- Yeah.

05:11.521 --> 05:12.939
Okay.

05:32.208 --> 05:34.460
So how do you speak such good English?

05:34.544 --> 05:37.213
I went to school
for a summer in Los Angeles.

05:37.296 --> 05:38.756
- Yeah?
- It's fine here?

05:38.840 --> 05:40.550
Yeah, this is good.

05:40.633 --> 05:42.760
Then I spent some time in London.

05:43.636 --> 05:45.054
Uh, well...

05:45.137 --> 05:47.348
How do you speak such good English?

05:47.431 --> 05:49.141
Me? I'm American.

05:49.225 --> 05:50.351
- You're American?
- Yeah.

05:50.434 --> 05:52.228
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

05:52.311 --> 05:55.273
(laughing) No, I'm joking.

05:55.356 --> 05:59.277
I knew you were American. And of course,
you don't speak any other language, right?

05:59.986 --> 06:01.988
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it, I get it.

06:02.071 --> 06:04.282
So I'm the crude, dumb, vulgar American

06:04.365 --> 06:07.201
who doesn't speak any other languages,
who has no culture, right?

06:07.285 --> 06:09.245
But I tried.

06:09.328 --> 06:11.455
I took French for four years
in high school.

06:11.539 --> 06:15.835
When I first got to Paris,
I stood in line at the Metro station,

06:15.918 --> 06:18.462
I was practicing -
<i>Une billet, s'il vous pláît.</i>

06:18.546 --> 06:20.840
<i>- Une billet, s'il vous pláît.
- Un billet</i>

06:20.923 --> 06:23.426
<i>Un,</i> whatever - <i>Un</i> - <i>Un</i> -

06:23.509 --> 06:26.262
<i>Un billet, s'il vous pláit
Un billet, s'il vous pláit</i>

06:26.345 --> 06:30.892
And I get up there and I look at this woman
and my mind goes completely blank.

06:30.975 --> 06:34.520
And I start saying, "Ah, listen, I need
a ticket to get to, um -"' You know.

06:34.604 --> 06:37.273
So, anyway. Um -

06:37.356 --> 06:39.400
So where are you headed?

06:39.483 --> 06:43.571
Well, back to Paris.
My classes start next week.

06:43.654 --> 06:47.491
- You're still in school? Where do you go?
- Yeah. La Sorbonne, you know?

06:47.575 --> 06:49.201
Sure.

06:50.703 --> 06:54.123
- Are you coming from Budapest?
- Yeah, I was visiting my grandmother.

06:54.206 --> 06:55.499
Ah. How is she?

06:55.583 --> 06:58.377
(laughing) She - She's okay.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.546
- She's all right?
- She's fine, yeah.

07:01.714 --> 07:05.051
- How about you? Where are you going?
- I'm going to Vienna.

07:05.134 --> 07:08.596
- Vienna? What's there?
- I have no idea. I'm flying out of there tomorrow.

07:08.679 --> 07:10.723
- Ah. You're on holiday?
- Uh...

07:14.060 --> 07:17.146
- Uh, I don't really know what I'm on.
- Okay.

07:17.229 --> 07:21.025
I'm just traveling around. I've been riding
the trains the past two, three weeks.

07:21.108 --> 07:24.654
Mm-hmm. You were visiting friends
or just on your own?

07:24.737 --> 07:28.407
- Yeah. I had a friend in Madrid, but, um -
- Madrid? That's nice.

07:28.491 --> 07:31.661
Yeah, I got one of those
Eurail passes, is what I did.

07:31.744 --> 07:33.245
That's great.

07:33.329 --> 07:37.667
So, has this trip around Europe
been good for you?

07:37.750 --> 07:40.628
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, it's been, um - It sucked.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.380
- You know?
- What?

07:42.463 --> 07:44.507
-(laughing) No, it's - It isn't -
-(laughing)

07:44.590 --> 07:47.134
It's had its, um - Well, I'll tell you.

07:47.218 --> 07:49.762
Sitting, you know, for weeks on end,
looking out the window

07:49.845 --> 07:51.931
has actually been kinda great.

07:53.307 --> 07:54.976
What do you mean?

07:55.977 --> 07:58.062
Well, uh, you know, for inst -

07:58.145 --> 08:00.856
You have ideas
that you ordinarily wouldn't have.

08:01.774 --> 08:03.442
- What kind of ideas?
- You wanna hear one?

08:03.526 --> 08:05.277
- Yeah, tell me.
- All right.

08:05.361 --> 08:08.406
- Uh, I have this idea, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

08:08.489 --> 08:12.034
For a television show. Some friends of mine
are these cable access producers.

08:12.118 --> 08:14.453
Do you know what that is, cable acc...

08:15.246 --> 08:19.250
Anybody can produce a show real cheap,
and they have to put it on. Right?

08:19.333 --> 08:23.587
I have this idea for this show that would last
24 hours a day, for a year straight, right?

08:23.671 --> 08:27.299
What you do is you get 365 people

08:27.383 --> 08:29.593
from cities all over the world

08:29.677 --> 08:32.596
to do these 24-hour documents of real time,

08:32.679 --> 08:35.599
capturing life as it's lived.

08:35.683 --> 08:38.977
You know, it would start
with a guy waking up in the morning

08:39.061 --> 08:41.313
and, uh, you know, taking a long shower,

08:41.397 --> 08:44.608
um, eating a little breakfast,
making a little coffee,

08:44.692 --> 08:47.111
you know, and, uh, reading the paper.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.530
Wait, wait, all those mundane, boring things

08:49.613 --> 08:52.950
everybody has to do
every day of their fucking life?

08:53.034 --> 08:54.952
I was gonna say
"the poetry of day-to-day life."

08:55.036 --> 08:57.955
But you say it the way you say it,
I'll say it the way I say it.

08:58.039 --> 09:00.958
- Who's gonna want to watch this?
- But think about it like this -

09:01.042 --> 09:05.296
Why is it that a dog
sleeping in the sun is so beautiful?

09:05.379 --> 09:07.089
You know? It is. It's beautiful.

09:07.173 --> 09:09.967
But a guy standing at a bank machine,
trying to take some money out,

09:10.051 --> 09:12.261
looks like a complete moron.

09:12.344 --> 09:16.599
So it's like a <i>National Geographic</i> program,
but on people.

09:16.682 --> 09:18.517
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

09:18.601 --> 09:21.520
- What do you think?
- I can - I can see it -

09:21.604 --> 09:23.856
Like 24 boring hours. Sorry.

09:23.939 --> 09:27.276
And, like, a three-minute sex scene
where he falls asleep right after, no?

09:28.569 --> 09:29.779
Yeah! You know -

09:29.862 --> 09:31.572
-I mean, that would be a great episode.
- Yeah.

09:31.655 --> 09:34.617
- People would talk about that episode.
-(laughing)

09:34.700 --> 09:36.952
You and your friends
could do one in Paris if you wanted to.

09:37.036 --> 09:38.829
Oh, sure.

09:38.913 --> 09:43.793
The key - The thing that kinda
haunts me is, uh - is the distribution.

09:43.876 --> 09:47.588
Getting these tapes from town to town,
city to city, so that it would play continuously.

09:47.671 --> 09:51.967
'Cause it'd have to play all the time
or else it just wouldn't work.

09:52.968 --> 09:54.637
Thank you.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.515
Thanks.

09:58.766 --> 10:01.435
You know what?
They're not service-oriented.

10:01.519 --> 10:02.853
(chuckles)

10:02.937 --> 10:05.564
Just an observation about Europe.

10:13.364 --> 10:17.827
My parents have never really spoken
of the possibility of my falling in love

10:17.910 --> 10:21.080
or getting married or having children.

10:21.163 --> 10:23.165
Even as a little girl,

10:23.249 --> 10:27.920
they wanted me to think as a future career
as a, you know, interior designer

10:28.003 --> 10:30.214
or lawyer or something like that.

10:30.297 --> 10:35.094
I'd say to my Dad, "I want to be a writer,"
and he'd say, "Journalist."

10:35.177 --> 10:39.890
I'd say I wanted to have a refuge for stray cats
and he'd say, "Veterinarian."

10:39.974 --> 10:42.726
I'd say I wanted to be an actress
and he'd say, "TV newscaster."

10:43.894 --> 10:46.981
It was this constant conversion
of my fanciful ambition

10:47.064 --> 10:50.276
into these practical,
moneymaking ventures.

10:50.359 --> 10:51.944
Mmm.

10:52.027 --> 10:55.322
I always had a pretty good
bullshit detector when I was a kid.

10:55.406 --> 10:57.783
I always knew when they were
lying to me, you know?

10:57.867 --> 10:59.577
By the time I was in high school,

10:59.660 --> 11:03.205
I was dead set on listening to what
everybody thought I should be doing with my life

11:03.289 --> 11:06.083
and just kinda. . . doing the opposite.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.253
Nobody was ever mean about it.

11:09.336 --> 11:14.717
It's just I could never get very excited
about other people's ambitions for my life.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.136
Hmm. But you know what?

11:17.219 --> 11:20.556
If your parents never really
fully contradict you about anything

11:20.639 --> 11:23.642
-and are basically nice and supportive -
- Right.

11:24.602 --> 11:27.354
It makes it even harder
to officially complain.

11:27.438 --> 11:29.106
You know, even when they're wrong.

11:29.190 --> 11:33.235
It's this passive-aggressive shit.
You know what I mean? It's...

11:33.319 --> 11:34.570
I hate it.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.655
- I really hate it.
-(chuckling)

11:36.739 --> 11:42.661
Well, you know, despite all that kind
of bullshit that comes along with it,

11:42.745 --> 11:45.748
I remember childhood as this...

11:46.582 --> 11:48.542
you know, this magical time.

11:48.626 --> 11:49.877
I do.

11:49.960 --> 11:53.839
I remember when, uh, my mother
first told me about death.

11:53.923 --> 11:56.133
My great-grandmother had just died,

11:56.217 --> 11:58.719
and my whole family
had just visited them in Florida.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.888
I was about three,
three and a half years old.

12:01.639 --> 12:04.683
Anyway, I was in the backyard, playing,

12:04.767 --> 12:06.769
and my sister had just taught me

12:06.852 --> 12:10.731
how to take the garden hose
and do it in such a way that,

12:10.814 --> 12:13.901
uh, it sprayed into the sun
and it would make a rainbow.

12:13.984 --> 12:15.986
Right?

12:16.070 --> 12:18.030
So I was doing that,

12:18.113 --> 12:21.116
and through the mist,
I could see my grandmother.

12:21.200 --> 12:25.079
You know? And she was
just standing there, smiling at me.

12:25.162 --> 12:28.499
And, uh, I held it there for a long time

12:28.582 --> 12:33.545
and I looked at her,
and then finally I-l let go of the nozzle.

12:33.629 --> 12:36.215
You know? And then I dropped the hose.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.092
And she disappeared.

12:38.175 --> 12:41.428
So I run back inside
and I tell my parents.

12:41.512 --> 12:45.474
And they, uh, sit me down
and give me this big rap

12:45.557 --> 12:50.688
on how, when people die, you never
see them again and how I'd imagined it.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.773
But I knew what I'd seen.

12:52.856 --> 12:55.818
I was just glad that I saw it.
I've never seen anything like that since.

12:55.901 --> 12:58.320
But I don't know.

12:58.404 --> 13:02.574
It just kinda let me know
how ambiguous everything was.

13:02.658 --> 13:04.243
You know? Even death.

13:05.703 --> 13:08.622
You're really lucky you can
have this attitude toward death.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.919
I think I'm afraid of death
24 hours a day.

13:14.003 --> 13:16.130
I swear.

13:16.213 --> 13:19.925
That's why I'm in a train right now.
I could have flown to Paris, but I'm too scared.

13:20.009 --> 13:22.845
- Oh, come on.
- I can't help it. I can't help it.

13:22.928 --> 13:26.473
I know the statistics say "na na na,"
it's safer. Whatever.

13:26.557 --> 13:29.977
When I'm in a plane, I can see it.
I can see the explosion.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.479
- I can see me falling through the clouds.
-(imitates explosion)

13:32.563 --> 13:37.901
And I'm so scared of those few seconds
of consciousness before you're gonna die.

13:37.985 --> 13:40.321
You know, when you know
for sure you're gonna die?

13:43.240 --> 13:45.451
I can't stop thinking that way.

13:45.534 --> 13:48.287
- It's - It's exhausting.
- Yeah, I bet.

13:48.370 --> 13:50.497
(laughs) Really exhausting.

13:54.752 --> 13:57.379
- I think this is Vienna.
- Yeah.

13:58.547 --> 14:01.759
- You get off here, no?
- Yeah. What a drag.

14:01.842 --> 14:05.095
I wish I had met you earlier.
I really like talking to you.

14:06.597 --> 14:08.515
Yeah, me too. (laughs)

14:08.599 --> 14:10.893
It was really nice talking to you.

14:33.582 --> 14:35.376
(man on PA speaking German)

14:41.965 --> 14:45.010
I have an admittedly insane idea,
but if I don't ask you this,

14:45.094 --> 14:47.096
it's gonna haunt me the rest of my life.

14:47.179 --> 14:48.972
What?

14:50.557 --> 14:55.646
Um. . . I want to keep talking to you.
I have no idea what your situation is.

14:55.729 --> 15:01.693
But, uh. . . But I feel like we have
some kind of a connection, right?

15:01.777 --> 15:04.405
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah, right. Well, great.

15:04.488 --> 15:08.867
So you should get off the train with me here
in Vienna and come check out the town.

15:08.951 --> 15:11.578
- What?
- Come on. It'll be fun. Come on.

15:11.662 --> 15:13.622
- What would we do?
- I don't know.

15:13.705 --> 15:17.626
All I know is I have to catch an Austrian
Airlines flight tomorrow morning at 9:30,

15:17.709 --> 15:20.754
and I don't have enough money for a hotel,
so I was just gonna walk around,

15:20.838 --> 15:23.215
and it'd be a lot more fun
if you came with me.

15:23.298 --> 15:27.594
And if I turn out to be some kind of psycho,
you just get on the next train.

15:27.678 --> 15:30.180
All right, think of it like this. Um...

15:31.682 --> 15:36.311
Uh, jump ahead ten, 20 years.
Okay? And you're married.

15:36.395 --> 15:40.065
Only your marriage doesn't have
that same energy that it used to have.

15:40.149 --> 15:42.443
You start to blame your husband.

15:42.526 --> 15:45.946
You start to think about all those guys
you've met in your life

15:46.029 --> 15:49.366
and what might have happened
if you picked up with one of them, right?

15:49.450 --> 15:51.618
Well, I'm one of those guys. That's me.

15:51.702 --> 15:54.663
So think of this as time travel
from then to now,

15:54.746 --> 15:57.458
to find out what you're missing out on.

15:57.541 --> 16:02.296
See, what this really could be is a gigantic
favor to both you and your future husband

16:02.379 --> 16:04.423
to find out that you're not
missing out on anything.

16:04.506 --> 16:07.259
I'm just as big a loser as he is,
totally unmotivated, totally boring,

16:07.342 --> 16:10.053
and, uh, you made the right choice
and you're really happy.

16:12.598 --> 16:15.350
- I . . .
-(mouthing words)

16:16.477 --> 16:19.646
- Let me get my bag.
- Yeah.

16:25.903 --> 16:27.654
(giggles)

16:44.880 --> 16:47.925
- We should get a locker for all this stuff.
- Okay.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.302
(PA announcer speaking German)

16:52.262 --> 16:56.058
- What's your name?
- My name? Uh, it's Jesse.

16:56.141 --> 16:58.644
It's James, actually,
but everybody always calls me Jesse.

16:58.727 --> 17:02.064
- You mean Jesse James?
- No, no, just Jesse.

17:02.147 --> 17:03.607
I'm Celine.

17:17.996 --> 17:20.499
- This is a nice bridge.
- Yeah.

17:25.587 --> 17:27.923
- This is kinda weird.
- Yeah, it's kinda weird, isn't it?

17:28.006 --> 17:31.260
I mean, it's a little awkward. (laughs)

17:31.343 --> 17:35.180
- But it's all right, right?
- Yeah, this is great. Let's go to some places.

17:35.264 --> 17:37.516
- Look at your book.
- We're in Vienna. Let's go to some places.

17:37.599 --> 17:39.935
- Look, let's ask these guys.
- Okay.

17:40.018 --> 17:42.437
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.

17:42.521 --> 17:45.691
<i>- Sprechen sie</i> English?
<i>- Ja.</i> Of course.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.277
- Could you speak German for a change?
- What?

17:48.360 --> 17:49.987
No, it was a joke.

17:50.070 --> 17:54.116
Well, listen, we just got into Vienna today
and we're looking for something fun to do.

17:54.199 --> 17:55.951
Like museums, exhibitions.

17:56.034 --> 17:59.162
But museums are not that funny
anymore these days.

17:59.246 --> 18:02.207
Uh, and they are closing right now.

18:02.291 --> 18:05.460
- How long are you going to be here?
- Just for tonight.

18:05.544 --> 18:08.797
Why did you come to Vienna?
What could you be expecting?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.966
Um...

18:11.049 --> 18:12.634
We're on honeymoon.

18:13.844 --> 18:16.597
Yeah. She got pregnant.
We had to get married.

18:16.680 --> 18:19.558
- No, I don't believe you. You're a bad liar.
-(laughing)

18:19.641 --> 18:21.560
Um. . . (laughs)

18:21.643 --> 18:24.396
(speaking German)

18:24.479 --> 18:27.983
This is, uh - This is a play we're both in.

18:28.066 --> 18:30.360
- And we would like to invite you.
- You're actors?

18:30.444 --> 18:32.821
Not professional actors.
Part-time actors for fun.

18:32.904 --> 18:36.241
It's a play about a cow
and the lndians searching for it.

18:36.325 --> 18:40.996
- There are also politicians, Mexicans, Russians.
- Communists.

18:41.079 --> 18:43.582
- You have a real cow on stage?
- No, not a real cow.

18:43.665 --> 18:46.209
- It's an actor in a cow costume.
- And he is the cow.

18:46.293 --> 18:49.379
Yes, I am the cow,
and the cow is a bit weird.

18:49.463 --> 18:53.216
- The cow has a disease.
- She's acting a bit strange, like a dog.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.136
If someone throws a stick,
she fetches it and brings it back.

18:56.219 --> 18:59.473
And she can smoke
with hooves and everything.

18:59.556 --> 19:02.559
- Great.
- And as you see, there's the address.

19:02.643 --> 19:06.271
- It's in the second district.
- Near the Prater. You know the Prater?

19:06.355 --> 19:10.609
- Ah, the big Ferris wheel. We should do it.
- Everybody knows the wheel.

19:10.692 --> 19:15.614
Perhaps you can go to the Prater
before the play. It starts at 21 :30.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.699
-21 :30?
- It's 9:30.

19:17.783 --> 19:20.077
Oh, 9:30. Right, right.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.704
Okay, great. What's the name of this play?

19:22.788 --> 19:26.291
It translates as <i>Bring Me The Horns</i>
<i>of Wilmington's Cow</i>

19:26.375 --> 19:29.419
- I'm Wilmington's cow.
- All right.

19:29.503 --> 19:31.338
- Will you be there?
- We'll try.

19:31.421 --> 19:33.340
- I'm the cow.
- You're the - (chuckles)

19:33.423 --> 19:35.050
Good-bye.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.264
(bell tolling)

19:54.736 --> 19:57.239
-I got an idea. Are you ready?
- Yeah.

19:57.322 --> 19:59.950
It's Q & A time.
We've known each other a little while now.

20:00.033 --> 20:04.204
We're stuck together, so we're gonna
ask each other a few direct questions.

20:04.287 --> 20:07.290
- All right?
- So we ask each other questions.

20:07.374 --> 20:10.836
- And you have to answer 100% honestly.
- Of course.

20:10.919 --> 20:13.964
- Okay. All right, first question.
- You.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.299
(German accent) Describe for me -
Yes, I'm going to ask you.

20:16.383 --> 20:22.013
Describe for me your first
sexual feelings towards a person.

20:23.140 --> 20:25.475
My first sexual feelings. Oh, my God.

20:25.559 --> 20:27.060
Um...

20:27.728 --> 20:29.563
I know, I know.

20:29.646 --> 20:32.107
Jean-Marc Fleury. (giggles)

20:32.190 --> 20:34.109
Jean-Marc Fleury?

20:34.192 --> 20:37.154
We were at this summer camp together,
and he was a swimmer.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.572
Yeah.

20:38.655 --> 20:41.700
He had bleached-out chlorine hair
and green eyes.

20:41.783 --> 20:45.287
And to improve his times,
he'd shave the hair off his legs and arms.

20:45.370 --> 20:48.874
- That's disgusting.
- Oh, no. He was like this gorgeous dolphin.

20:48.957 --> 20:51.376
And my friend Emma
had a big, big crush on him.

20:51.460 --> 20:54.755
So one day I was cutting across the field
back to my room

20:54.838 --> 20:56.757
and he came walking up beside me.

20:56.840 --> 21:01.470
And I told him, "You should date Emma
because she has a big crush on you."

21:01.553 --> 21:04.806
And he turned to me and said,
"Well, that's too bad,

21:04.890 --> 21:07.434
because I have a big crush on you."

21:07.517 --> 21:12.939
So - Yeah. It scared the hell out of me
because I thought he was so fine.

21:13.023 --> 21:15.567
And then he officially
asked me out on a date.

21:15.650 --> 21:18.069
You know, I pretended I didn't like him.

21:19.321 --> 21:23.283
You know, I was so afraid
of what I might do.

21:23.366 --> 21:25.285
Uh. . . Well...

21:25.368 --> 21:28.955
I went to see him swim a few times
at the swimming competition.

21:29.039 --> 21:32.125
He was so sexy, really.
I mean really sexy.

21:32.209 --> 21:35.504
You know, we kind of wrote these
little declarations of love to each other

21:35.587 --> 21:37.255
at the end of the summer

21:37.339 --> 21:42.886
and promised we would keep writing forever
and, like, meet again very soon.

21:42.969 --> 21:46.139
- Did you?
- Of course not.

21:46.223 --> 21:48.141
Then I think this is
the opportune time to tell you

21:48.225 --> 21:50.435
that I happen to be a fantastic swimmer.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.271
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:53.355 --> 21:56.024
- I'll make note of that.
- Okay. Uh...

21:56.107 --> 21:58.693
- So it's my turn, no?
- All right. Yes, your turn.

21:58.777 --> 22:00.195
- Hit me.
- Um...

22:01.863 --> 22:03.615
Have you ever been in love?

22:05.534 --> 22:08.453
Yes. Next question.

22:08.537 --> 22:10.455
- What was the first -
- Wait a minute.

22:10.539 --> 22:12.457
- So we can give one-word answers?
- Sure. Why not?

22:12.541 --> 22:15.919
No, no. After I went into such private details
about my first sexual feelings?

22:16.002 --> 22:18.129
I know, but those are
two very different questions.

22:18.213 --> 22:21.633
I could answer the sexual feelings thing,
no problem, but love -

22:21.716 --> 22:24.386
- What if I asked you about love?
-(giggles)

22:24.469 --> 22:27.681
I would have lied, but at least
I would have made up a great story.

22:27.764 --> 22:30.475
You would've lied ! Great.
Love is a complex issue.

22:30.559 --> 22:32.477
I mean, it's like, um -

22:32.561 --> 22:35.981
Yes, I have told somebody that I
loved them before, and I had meant it.

22:36.064 --> 22:39.693
But was it totally unselfish, giving love?

22:39.776 --> 22:42.529
Was it a beautiful thing? Not really.

22:42.612 --> 22:45.240
It's like, love -

22:45.323 --> 22:47.659
I mean, I don't know.

22:47.742 --> 22:49.911
You know?

22:49.995 --> 22:51.663
Yeah, I know what you mean.

22:51.746 --> 22:53.874
But as far as sexual feelings go,

22:53.957 --> 22:58.837
I'll have you know it started with an obsessive
relationship with Miss July 1978.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.172
- Do you know <i>Playboy</i> magazine?
- Yeah, I've heard of it.

23:01.256 --> 23:02.841
- Do you know Crystal?
- No.

23:02.924 --> 23:05.677
You don't know Crystal?
Well, I knew Crystal.

23:06.511 --> 23:08.763
Um, is it my turn now?

23:08.847 --> 23:12.100
Okay, tell me something
that really pisses you off,

23:12.183 --> 23:14.102
really drives you crazy.

23:14.185 --> 23:18.023
- Pisses me off? Everything pisses me off.
- Okay, list a couple.

23:18.106 --> 23:19.774
Um. . . Wait, I know.

23:19.858 --> 23:23.528
I hate being told by strange men,
a strange man in the street -

23:23.612 --> 23:24.863
Yeah?

23:24.946 --> 23:29.284
You know, like, to smile to make them
feel better about their boring life.

23:29.367 --> 23:31.119
Um, what else?

23:31.202 --> 23:35.040
I hate -
I hate that 300 kilometers from here,

23:35.123 --> 23:38.960
there's a war going on, people are dying
and nobody knows what to do about it.

23:39.044 --> 23:41.338
Or they don't give a shit, I don't know.

23:41.421 --> 23:45.133
I hate that the medias - You know,
they're trying to control our minds.

23:45.216 --> 23:47.135
- The media?
- Yeah, the media.

23:47.218 --> 23:50.472
It's very subtle,
but it's a new form of fascism, really.

23:50.555 --> 23:52.474
Um. . . Um...

23:52.557 --> 23:54.434
I hate - (chuckles)

23:54.517 --> 23:58.396
I hate when I'm in a foreign country,
especially in America - they're the worst.

23:58.480 --> 24:02.901
Each time I wear black or lose my temper
or say anything about anything,

24:02.984 --> 24:05.904
they always go,
"Oh, it's so French, it's so cute."

24:05.987 --> 24:09.574
(makes gagging noise)
I hate that. I can't stand it, really.

24:10.951 --> 24:14.955
- Is that all?
- Well, there's a lot of things, but...

24:15.038 --> 24:17.582
- So, it's my turn.
- Okay.

24:17.666 --> 24:20.126
- You're gonna answer?
- Yes, I'll answer.

24:20.210 --> 24:23.880
- Uh, what's a problem for you?
- You, probably.

24:23.964 --> 24:25.924
(laughing) What?

24:26.007 --> 24:31.221
No. I had a thought the other day
that kind of qualifies as a problem.

24:31.304 --> 24:34.391
- What is it?
- It was a thought I had on the train.

24:34.474 --> 24:37.018
So okay, all right.

24:37.102 --> 24:39.562
Um, do you believe in reincarnation?

24:39.646 --> 24:41.773
- Yeah, yeah. It's interesting.
- Yeah. Right.

24:41.856 --> 24:45.610
Most people talk about past lives
and things like that.

24:45.694 --> 24:49.864
You know, and even if they don't
believe it in some specific way,

24:49.948 --> 24:52.409
people have some kind of notion
of an eternal soul, right?

24:52.492 --> 24:54.661
- Yeah.
- Okay. Well, this was my thought.

24:54.744 --> 24:58.373
50,000 years ago, there were not
even a million people on the planet.

24:58.456 --> 25:02.293
10,000 years ago, there's, like,
two million people on the planet.

25:02.377 --> 25:06.464
Now there's between five
and six billion people on the planet.

25:06.548 --> 25:11.845
Now, if we all have
our own individual, unique soul,

25:11.928 --> 25:13.805
where do they all come from?

25:13.888 --> 25:17.642
Are modern souls
only a fraction of the original souls?

25:17.726 --> 25:20.937
'Cause if they are,
that represents a 5,000-to-1 split

25:21.021 --> 25:23.231
of each soul
in just the last 50,000 years,

25:23.314 --> 25:25.650
which is like a blip in the earth's time.

25:25.734 --> 25:30.947
So at best, we're like these
tiny fractions of people walking...

25:31.031 --> 25:35.368
Is that why we're so scattered?
Is that why we're all so specialized?

25:35.452 --> 25:38.580
- Wait a minute. I'm not sure - I don't agree -
- I know, I know.

25:38.663 --> 25:40.498
It's a totally scattered thought.

25:41.583 --> 25:44.335
Which is kinda why
it makes sense, you know?

25:44.419 --> 25:46.337
I agree with you.

29:15.129 --> 29:17.382
I think it left a bigger impression on me
at that time

29:17.465 --> 29:19.133
than any of the museums we went to.

29:19.217 --> 29:21.052
Yeah? It's tiny.

29:21.135 --> 29:22.720
I know.

29:22.804 --> 29:25.974
There was this little old man that talked to us.
He was the groundskeeper.

29:26.057 --> 29:28.893
He explained that most of the people
buried here,

29:28.977 --> 29:31.729
they'd washed up on the bank
of the Danube.

29:33.273 --> 29:34.983
How old are these?

29:35.066 --> 29:37.568
Around the beginning of the century or so.

29:37.652 --> 29:40.405
It's called "Cemetery of the No-Name"
because they often didn't really know

29:40.488 --> 29:44.158
who those people were -
maybe a first name, that's all.

29:44.242 --> 29:46.452
Why were all the bodies washing up?

29:46.536 --> 29:50.498
I think some were from accidents
on boats and things like that.

29:50.581 --> 29:53.626
But most of them were suicides
that jumped in the river.

29:55.670 --> 29:59.757
I always liked the idea of all those
unknown people lost in the world.

29:59.841 --> 30:04.137
When I was a little girl, I thought that if none
of your family or friends knew you were dead,

30:04.220 --> 30:06.973
then it's like not really being dead.

30:07.056 --> 30:09.892
People can invent
the best and the worst for you.

30:13.396 --> 30:15.690
Ah, here she is, I think.

30:15.773 --> 30:18.776
Yeah, this is the one I remember the most.

30:22.071 --> 30:24.741
She was only 13 when she died.

30:24.824 --> 30:29.370
That meant something to me.
I was that age when I first saw this.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.665
Hmm.

30:33.916 --> 30:38.171
Now I'm ten years older
and she's still 13, I guess.

30:39.881 --> 30:41.799
That's funny.

31:01.319 --> 31:03.863
CELINE: That's the Danube over there.

31:03.946 --> 31:07.158
- JESSE: That's a river, right?
-(chuckling) Yeah.

31:14.832 --> 31:18.294
This is gorgeous.

31:19.045 --> 31:21.214
Yeah, this is beautiful.

31:27.345 --> 31:30.515
And we got, uh. . . We got a sunset here.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.768
- Yeah.
- We got the Ferris wheel -

31:35.937 --> 31:38.606
It seems like, um,

31:38.689 --> 31:40.024
this would be, uh...

31:41.526 --> 31:43.111
What?

31:45.905 --> 31:48.449
Uh, you know, um...

31:53.538 --> 31:56.541
Are you trying to say you want to kiss me?

31:57.583 --> 31:59.127
Yes?

32:40.877 --> 32:43.504

- CELINE: But you know what?
- What?

33:06.611 --> 33:09.572
I don't think it really matters
what generation you're born into.

33:09.655 --> 33:11.115
Look at my parents.

33:11.199 --> 33:13.659
They were these angry,
young May '68 people

33:13.743 --> 33:15.745
revolting against everything -

33:15.828 --> 33:19.207
the government,
their conservative Catholic backgrounds.

33:19.290 --> 33:20.791
I was born not long after.

33:20.875 --> 33:23.294
Then my father went on
to become this successful architect

33:23.377 --> 33:28.841
and we began to travel all around the world
while he built bridges and towers and stuff.

33:28.925 --> 33:31.636
I mean, I really can't
complain about anything.

33:31.719 --> 33:34.222
You know, they love me more
than anything in the world.

33:34.305 --> 33:37.391
I've been raised with all the freedom
they had fought for.

33:37.475 --> 33:40.770
And yet, for me now,
it's another type of fight.

33:40.853 --> 33:44.357
We still have to deal with the same old shit,
but we can't really know

33:44.440 --> 33:47.610
who or what the enemy is.

33:47.693 --> 33:50.112
I don't know if there really is an enemy.
You know?

33:50.196 --> 33:52.073
Everybody's parents fucked them up.

33:52.156 --> 33:55.451
Rich kids' parents gave them too much,
poor kids not enough.

33:55.535 --> 33:58.454
Um, you know, too much attention,
not enough attention.

33:58.538 --> 34:01.874
They either left them, or they stuck around,
taught 'em the wrong things.

34:01.958 --> 34:06.045
I mean, my parents are just these two people
who didn't like each other very much,

34:06.128 --> 34:08.047
who decided to get married and have a kid.

34:08.130 --> 34:10.716
And they try their best to be nice to me.

34:11.717 --> 34:14.469
- Did your parents divorce?
- Yeah, finally.

34:14.554 --> 34:17.181
They should've done it a lot sooner,
but they stuck together for a while

34:17.264 --> 34:20.016
for the well-being of my sister and I,
thank you very much.

34:20.101 --> 34:23.103
-(chuckling)
- I remember my mother once -

34:23.187 --> 34:26.482
She told me right in front of my father -
They were having this big fight -

34:26.565 --> 34:28.275
that he didn't really want to have me,

34:28.359 --> 34:31.696
that he was really pissed off when he
found out that she was pregnant with me,

34:31.779 --> 34:33.322
that I was this big mistake.

34:33.406 --> 34:35.324
That really shaped the way I think.

34:35.408 --> 34:39.203
I always saw the world as this place
where I really wasn't meant to be.

34:39.286 --> 34:40.830
That's so sad.

34:40.913 --> 34:46.585
Well, I mean, I eventually took pride in it,
like my life was my own doing or something,

34:46.668 --> 34:49.213
like I was crashing the big party.

34:49.297 --> 34:52.049
(laughing) That's the way to see it.

34:52.132 --> 34:55.594
My parents, they're still married,
and I guess they're very happy.

34:55.678 --> 35:00.308
But I think it's a healthy process to rebel
against everything that came before.

35:00.391 --> 35:02.643
Yeah. Yeah. But...

35:05.187 --> 35:06.939
I've been wondering lately.

35:08.190 --> 35:11.277
Do you know anyone
who's in a happy relationship?

35:12.820 --> 35:14.572
Uh, yeah, sure.

35:14.655 --> 35:16.198
I know happy couples.

35:17.074 --> 35:19.702
- But I think they lie to each other.
-(giggles)

35:19.785 --> 35:21.329
Yeah.

35:22.121 --> 35:24.332
People can live their whole life as a lie.

35:24.415 --> 35:26.417
My grandmother,
she was married to this man,

35:26.500 --> 35:29.837
and I always thought she had
a very simple, uncomplicated love life.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.089
But she just confessed to me

35:32.173 --> 35:37.261
that she spent her whole life dreaming about
another man she was always in love with.

35:37.345 --> 35:40.473
She just accepted her fate. It's so sad.

35:41.265 --> 35:44.602
In the same time, I love the idea
that she had those emotions and feelings

35:44.685 --> 35:46.604
I never thought she would have had.

35:46.687 --> 35:49.106
I guarantee you, it was better that way.

35:49.190 --> 35:52.735
If she'd ever got to know him, I'm sure
he would have disappointed her eventually.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.237
- How do know? You don't know them.
- Yeah, I know.

35:55.321 --> 35:58.449
It's just, people have these romantic
projections they put on everything

35:58.532 --> 36:00.910
that's not based on any kind of reality.

36:00.993 --> 36:02.745
- Romantic projections?
- Yeah.

36:02.828 --> 36:05.247
Oh, Mr. Romantic
up there on the Ferris wheel -

36:05.331 --> 36:09.168
-"Oh, kiss me. The sunset. Oh, it's so beautiful."
- All right, all right.

36:09.251 --> 36:11.879
Tell me about your grandmother.
What were you saying about her?

36:11.962 --> 36:15.132
-(giggling)
-(shouts)

36:29.146 --> 36:31.607
JESSE: Hey, check these guys out.

36:31.691 --> 36:33.818
"Hey, Hans, I have a confession to make.

36:33.901 --> 36:35.820
I'm not wearing any underwear
underneath this thing."

36:35.903 --> 36:38.906
-(laughing)
-"Oh, really? Does that frighten you?"

36:45.454 --> 36:48.499
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Yeah.

36:48.582 --> 36:50.459
- Come here.
- What?

36:50.543 --> 36:52.294
Come here.

She's interesting-looking, no?

37:08.686 --> 37:10.187

37:10.271 --> 37:11.897
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- What?

37:11.981 --> 37:14.775
- I just made eye contact.
- She's not coming over?

37:14.859 --> 37:16.527
- Yeah, she is.
- Oh, shit.

37:17.778 --> 37:19.905
(Celine laughing)

37:19.989 --> 37:21.490
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

37:21.574 --> 37:23.701
- CELINE: You want your palm read?
- No. Not at all.

37:23.784 --> 37:25.786
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

37:25.870 --> 37:27.663
- Okay.
- Hello.

37:27.747 --> 37:29.165
Here she is.

37:30.082 --> 37:32.752
(speaking German)

37:32.835 --> 37:35.504
Uh, <i>Français,</i> English?

37:39.675 --> 37:41.969
I want your palm read.

37:44.013 --> 37:46.223
Yeah. How much is it?

37:46.307 --> 37:49.310
For you, 50. Okay?

37:49.393 --> 37:50.895
Okay.

37:55.608 --> 37:56.817
Oh.

37:56.901 --> 38:00.154
So you have been on a journey

38:00.237 --> 38:02.281
and you are a stranger to this place.

38:03.199 --> 38:07.077
(chuckles) You are an adventurer,

38:07.161 --> 38:08.579
a seeker,

38:09.663 --> 38:12.208
an adventurer in your mind.

38:16.212 --> 38:20.216
You are interested
in the power of the woman,

38:20.299 --> 38:25.429
in a woman's deep strength and creativity.

38:25.513 --> 38:27.723
You're becoming this woman.

38:33.020 --> 38:38.025
But you need to resign yourself
to the awkwardness of life.

38:38.108 --> 38:41.570
Only if you find peace within yourself

38:42.279 --> 38:45.866
will you find true connection with others.

38:49.286 --> 38:52.790
- He is a stranger to you?
- Mmm, I guess so.

38:57.628 --> 39:01.006
(sighs)
You will be all right. He's learning.

39:01.090 --> 39:03.050
(chuckles) Okay.

39:03.843 --> 39:05.427
Money.

39:12.560 --> 39:14.603
You're both stars.

39:14.687 --> 39:16.730
Don't forget.

39:16.814 --> 39:19.900
When the stars exploded
billions of years ago,

39:19.984 --> 39:22.945
they formed everything that is this world.

39:23.028 --> 39:26.031
Everything we know is stardust.

39:26.115 --> 39:29.785
So don't forget you are stardust.

39:29.869 --> 39:31.871
(laughing)

39:34.748 --> 39:36.750
I mean, that's very nice and all,

39:36.834 --> 39:42.172
I mean, that we're all stardust
and you're becoming this great woman.

39:42.256 --> 39:44.258
But I hope you don't
take that any more seriously

39:44.341 --> 39:47.261
than some horoscope
in a daily syndicated newspaper.

39:47.344 --> 39:49.263
What are you talking about?

39:49.346 --> 39:51.891
She knew I was on vacation
and that we didn't know each other

39:51.974 --> 39:54.226
and that I was going to
become this great woman.

39:54.310 --> 39:57.521
But what was that
"I am learning" bullshit?

39:57.605 --> 40:00.190
That's way condescending, you know?

40:00.274 --> 40:02.192
She wasn't even doing me.

40:02.276 --> 40:06.739
I mean, if opportunists like that
ever had to tell the real truth,

40:06.822 --> 40:08.949
it would put their asses out of business.

40:09.033 --> 40:12.077
Just once I'd love to see
some little old lady

40:12.161 --> 40:15.122
save up all her money
to go to the fortune-teller,

40:15.205 --> 40:18.667
she'd get there all excited about hearing
her future and the woman would say,

40:18.751 --> 40:23.839
"Uh-huh. . . Tomorrow
and all your remaining days

40:23.923 --> 40:26.091
will be exactly like today,

40:26.175 --> 40:28.802
a tedious collection of hours.

40:28.886 --> 40:32.264
And you will have no new passions
and no new thoughts

40:32.348 --> 40:34.725
and no new travels.

40:34.808 --> 40:37.102
And when you die,
you'll be completely forgotten."

40:37.186 --> 40:38.479
You know?

40:38.562 --> 40:40.314
"Fifty schillings, please."

40:40.397 --> 40:42.566
- That I'd like to see.
-(laughs)

40:43.317 --> 40:46.695
It's so funny how she almost
didn't notice you, huh?

40:46.779 --> 40:48.572
It's weird. I wonder why.

40:48.656 --> 40:51.825
- She was really wise and intense.
- Wi - Yeah?

40:51.909 --> 40:54.161
- I really love what she said.
- Of course you do.

40:54.244 --> 40:57.039
You pay your money, you hear something
that makes you feel good about yourself.

40:57.122 --> 41:00.751
If you want, there's a seedy section
of Vienna we can buy a hit of crack.

41:00.834 --> 41:02.753
Would you like that? Huh? Yeah?

41:02.836 --> 41:04.755
(giggles) You're so -

41:05.881 --> 41:07.758
Stardust! Stardust!

41:12.763 --> 41:15.391
Ow! (French)

41:17.267 --> 41:18.811
Oh, there's an exhibition.

41:20.104 --> 41:22.064
Yup, I guess we'll miss it.

41:22.147 --> 41:24.566
Doesn't start until next week.

41:24.650 --> 41:26.568
Yeah, I think so.

41:28.779 --> 41:31.573
I actually saw this one
a few years ago in a museum.

41:32.700 --> 41:36.829
I stared and stared at it.
Must have been 45 minutes.

41:38.038 --> 41:39.164
I love it.

41:40.082 --> 41:42.334
<i>"La Voie Ferrée."</i> That's great.

41:44.169 --> 41:47.840
I love the way the people seem
to be dissolving into the background.

41:49.299 --> 41:51.885
Look at this one.

41:51.969 --> 41:55.764
It's like the environment's,
you know, stronger than the people.

41:57.725 --> 42:00.769
His human figures
are always so transitory.

42:00.853 --> 42:03.188
It's funny. Transitory?

42:03.272 --> 42:05.065
Transitory.

42:10.654 --> 42:13.323
-(footsteps)
-(bell tolling)

42:23.751 --> 42:26.712
- You think this is open?
- I don't know. Let's try it.

42:26.795 --> 42:28.964
(horn honking)

42:53.155 --> 42:56.200
I was in an old church
like this with my grandmother

42:56.283 --> 42:58.202
a few days ago in Budapest.

43:00.496 --> 43:03.665
Even though I reject
most of the religious thing,

43:03.749 --> 43:06.668
I can't help but feeling
for all those people

43:06.752 --> 43:10.839
that come here, lost or in pain, guilt,

43:11.924 --> 43:13.842
looking for some kind of answers.

43:15.677 --> 43:19.515
It fascinates me how a single place
can join so much pain and happiness

43:19.598 --> 43:22.309
for so many generations.

43:22.392 --> 43:23.936
You close with your grandmother?

43:26.522 --> 43:28.148
Yeah.

43:29.775 --> 43:32.694
I think it's because
I always have this strange feeling

43:32.778 --> 43:35.656
that I'm this very old woman,

43:35.739 --> 43:37.491
laying down, about to die.

43:39.326 --> 43:43.664
You know, that my life is just
memories or something.

43:47.376 --> 43:49.294
That's so wild.

43:49.378 --> 43:54.299
I mean, I always think that
I'm still this 13-year-old boy

43:54.383 --> 43:56.593
who doesn't really know
how to be an adult,

43:56.677 --> 44:02.558
pretending to live my life, taking notes
for when I'll really have to do it.

44:02.641 --> 44:05.936
Kind of like I'm in a dress rehearsal
for a junior high play.

44:08.438 --> 44:10.566
That's funny.

44:10.649 --> 44:14.361
Then up there in the Ferris wheel
was, like, this very old woman

44:14.444 --> 44:16.155
kissing this very young boy.

44:16.238 --> 44:17.948
- Right?
- Mmm.

44:22.077 --> 44:26.498
Do you know anything about the Quakers -
the Quaker religion?

44:26.582 --> 44:28.584
- No, not much.
- No?

44:28.667 --> 44:31.295
I went to this Quaker wedding once.

44:31.378 --> 44:33.547
It was fantastic.

44:33.630 --> 44:36.967
What they do is the couple comes in
and they kneel down

44:37.050 --> 44:39.344
in front of the whole congregation,

44:39.428 --> 44:41.972
and they just stare at each other.

44:42.055 --> 44:43.432
And nobody says a word

44:43.515 --> 44:47.936
unless they feel that God moves them
to speak or say something.

44:48.937 --> 44:52.941
And then after an hour or so of just, uh,

44:53.025 --> 44:55.194
staring at each other,

44:55.277 --> 44:57.070
they're married.

44:58.405 --> 45:00.699
That's beautiful. I like that.

45:17.007 --> 45:18.967
This is a horrible story.

45:19.885 --> 45:21.053
What?

45:21.136 --> 45:23.263
It's not the appropriate place to tell it, but -

45:23.347 --> 45:27.059
- What?
- I was driving around with this buddy of mine.

45:27.142 --> 45:28.644
He's a big atheist.

45:28.727 --> 45:32.314
And we came to a stop
next to this homeless guy.

45:32.397 --> 45:35.025
My buddy takes out a hundred-dollar bill,

45:35.108 --> 45:38.528
he leans out of the window and he says,

45:38.612 --> 45:40.822
"Do you believe in God?"

45:40.906 --> 45:44.618
The guy looks at my friend,
he looks at the money,

45:44.701 --> 45:46.119
says, uh...

45:46.954 --> 45:48.747
"Yes, I do."

45:48.830 --> 45:52.209
My friend says, "Wrong answer."
We drove away.

45:53.293 --> 45:56.546
- That's mean, no?
- Yeah. Yeah.

46:04.263 --> 46:05.973
Ow! (laughing)

46:06.056 --> 46:10.352
Would you be in Paris by now
if you hadn't gotten off the train with me?

46:10.435 --> 46:12.020
No, not yet.

46:12.980 --> 46:14.648
What would you be doing?

46:14.731 --> 46:17.401
I'd probably be hanging around the airport,
reading old magazines,

46:17.484 --> 46:20.153
crying in my coffee
'cause you didn't come with me.

46:20.237 --> 46:22.114
Oh! Oh.

46:24.908 --> 46:28.912
Actually, I think I'd probably gotten off
the train in Salzburg with someone else.

46:28.996 --> 46:31.123
Oh, yeah? Oh, I see.

46:31.206 --> 46:33.292
So I'm just a dumb American

46:33.375 --> 46:37.546
momentarily decorating
your blank canvas, huh?

46:37.629 --> 46:39.798
- I'm having a great time.
- Really?

46:39.881 --> 46:41.717
- Yeah.
- Me too.

46:43.885 --> 46:47.514
I'm so glad because no one knows I'm here,
and I don't know anyone that knows you

46:47.597 --> 46:50.600
that would tell me
all the bad things you've done.

46:50.684 --> 46:53.020
- I'll tell you some.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

46:53.979 --> 46:56.940
You know, you hear
so much shit about people.

46:57.024 --> 47:00.736
I always feel like the general of an army
when I start dating a guy,

47:00.819 --> 47:02.988
plotting my strategy and maneuverings,

47:03.071 --> 47:06.116
knowing his weak points,
what would hurt him, seduce him.

47:07.034 --> 47:08.702
It's horrible.

47:12.664 --> 47:14.583
If we were around each other all the time,

47:14.666 --> 47:18.045
what would be the first thing about me
that would drive you mad?

47:18.128 --> 47:20.589
Mmm - Uh, no, no.
I'm not going to answer this question.

47:20.672 --> 47:21.923
- What?
- No.

47:22.007 --> 47:25.510
I just - I dated this girl once
who used to always ask me that.

47:25.594 --> 47:27.471
-"What about me bugs you?"
- Uh-huh.

47:27.554 --> 47:31.391
So finally I said, "Well, I don't think
you handle criticism too well."

47:31.475 --> 47:34.644
She flew into a rage and broke up with me.
That's a true story.

47:34.728 --> 47:37.314
All she ever really wanted to do
was to have an excuse

47:37.397 --> 47:39.900
to tell me what she thought
was wrong with me.

47:39.983 --> 47:41.526
- Is that what you want?
- What?

47:41.610 --> 47:43.445
- Something about me bugs you?
- No.

47:43.528 --> 47:46.615
- Tell me. What is it about me bugs you?
- Nothing at all.

47:46.698 --> 47:49.368
If it had to be something,
what would it be?

47:49.451 --> 47:53.205
If it had to be something,
if I <i>had</i> to think about it,

47:53.288 --> 47:57.000
I kind of didn't really like this reaction
back at the palm reader.

47:57.084 --> 47:59.544
You were like this rooster prick.

47:59.628 --> 48:01.880
Rooster prick?
What the hell is a rooster prick?

48:01.963 --> 48:06.176
You were like a little boy whining because
all the attention wasn't focused on him.

48:06.259 --> 48:09.388
Listen, this woman robs you blind, okay?

48:09.471 --> 48:12.015
You were like a little boy,
walking by an ice cream store,

48:12.099 --> 48:15.060
crying because his mother wouldn't
buy him a milk shake or something.

48:15.143 --> 48:18.438
- I don't care what the charlatan has to say -
-(man speaking German) Hello.

48:18.522 --> 48:20.982
-(speaking German)
- What?

48:22.067 --> 48:25.404
-(German)
- Oh. I understand a little bit.

48:25.487 --> 48:28.031
But he doesn't at all. I'm sorry.

48:28.115 --> 48:30.659
Okay, so, um...

48:30.742 --> 48:32.327
May I ask you a question?

48:33.078 --> 48:34.621
Yeah.

48:34.704 --> 48:37.582
So, I would like to make a deal with you.

48:39.501 --> 48:44.047
I mean, instead of just asking you for money,
I will ask you for a word.

48:44.131 --> 48:46.591
You give me a word. I'll take the word.

48:46.675 --> 48:50.178
Then I will write a poem
with the word inside.

48:51.346 --> 48:53.890
And if you like it, if you like my poem,

48:53.974 --> 48:57.018
if you feel it adds something
to your life in any way,

48:57.102 --> 48:59.688
then you can pay me
whatever you feel like.

49:00.397 --> 49:02.399
I write in English, of course.

49:03.525 --> 49:05.318
- Okay.
- All right. Great.

49:07.821 --> 49:09.573
So?

49:10.490 --> 49:11.658
Pick a word.

49:12.451 --> 49:14.202
Oh, um -

49:14.286 --> 49:17.914
A word. Um. . . milk shake.

49:17.998 --> 49:22.252
Milk shake. Oh, good. I was gonna say
"rooster prick." But great. Milk shake.

49:22.335 --> 49:26.214
Milk shake? Okay. Milk shake.

49:26.923 --> 49:29.426
- All right, so, we'll. . .
- Good.

49:39.769 --> 49:44.191
JESSE: Gotta say I like this
Viennese variation of a bum.

49:44.274 --> 49:46.902
I like what he said about
adding something to your life, no?

49:46.985 --> 49:48.153
Yeah.

49:48.236 --> 49:51.656
So, uh, were we having
our first fight back there?

49:51.740 --> 49:53.658
- No.
- Yeah, I think so.

49:53.742 --> 49:55.160
I think we were.

49:55.243 --> 49:58.955
Even if we were a little bit, why does
everyone think conflict is so bad?

49:59.039 --> 50:01.166
There's a lot of good things
coming out of conflict.

50:01.249 --> 50:05.378
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. I don't know.

50:05.462 --> 50:09.508
I always think if I could just accept the fact
that my life was supposed to be difficult,

50:09.591 --> 50:11.635
that's what's to be expected,

50:11.718 --> 50:16.723
then I might not get so pissed off about it
and I'd be glad when something nice happens.

50:16.806 --> 50:20.560
Maybe that's why I'm still in school.
It's easier to have something to fight against.

50:20.644 --> 50:24.940
Yeah, well, we've all had such
competitiveness ingrained in us.

50:25.023 --> 50:27.442
I can be doing the most nothing thing.

50:27.526 --> 50:31.154
I can be throwing some darts,
shooting some pool,

50:31.238 --> 50:34.157
and all of a sudden
I feel it come over me -

50:34.241 --> 50:36.535
I have <i>got</i> to win.

50:36.618 --> 50:40.038
CELINE: Is that why you tried to
get me off the train - competitiveness?

50:40.121 --> 50:41.748
- JESSE: What do you mean?
- Okay.

50:43.166 --> 50:44.834
Got your poem.

50:44.918 --> 50:46.920
Oh, all right.

50:48.421 --> 50:50.423
Will you read it to us?

50:53.677 --> 50:55.428
Sure. Okay.

50:59.182 --> 51:01.393
"Daydream delusion,

51:01.476 --> 51:03.270
limousine eyelash.

51:04.062 --> 51:06.439
Oh, baby, with your pretty face.

51:08.066 --> 51:09.901
Drop a tear in my wine glass.

51:09.985 --> 51:12.237
Look at those big eyes.

51:12.320 --> 51:14.864
See what you mean to me -

51:14.948 --> 51:17.659
sweet cakes and milk shakes.

51:17.742 --> 51:19.911
I'm a delusion angel.

51:20.704 --> 51:23.248
I'm a fantasy parade.

51:23.331 --> 51:27.460
I want you to know what I think.
Don't want you to guess anymore.

51:27.544 --> 51:30.088
You have no idea where I came from.

51:30.171 --> 51:32.173
We have no idea where we're going.

51:32.257 --> 51:36.177
Lodged in life like branches in the river.

51:36.261 --> 51:39.306
Flowing downstream, caught in the current.

51:39.389 --> 51:42.434
I'll carry you. You'll carry me.

51:43.435 --> 51:45.145
That's how it could be.

51:46.271 --> 51:48.773
Don't you know me?

51:48.857 --> 51:50.817
Don't you know me by now?"

51:51.943 --> 51:53.778
Great.

51:53.862 --> 51:55.864
- Thanks.
- Thanks, man.

51:56.615 --> 51:58.116
Uh -

51:59.659 --> 52:00.994
Here you go, uh -

52:02.746 --> 52:04.497
- Thanks.
- JESSE: All right.

52:04.581 --> 52:06.875
- Here. Thank you.
- Thank you.

52:06.958 --> 52:08.918
- Good luck, man.
- Bye.

52:09.002 --> 52:10.503
- Bye.
- Bye.

52:24.184 --> 52:26.686
- That's wonderful, no?
- Yeah, yeah.

52:30.565 --> 52:33.568
- What?
- You know he probably didn't just write that.

52:33.652 --> 52:36.404
He wrote it, but he probably
just plugs that word in -

52:36.488 --> 52:38.698
whatever - milk shake, you know.

52:38.782 --> 52:40.617
What do you mean?

52:40.700 --> 52:42.786
Nothing. I loved it. It was great.

52:42.869 --> 52:44.371
(laughing)

52:50.293 --> 52:52.253
- JESSE: You know what drives me crazy?
- What?

52:52.337 --> 52:56.091
There's all these people talking about
how great technology is and how it saves time.

52:56.174 --> 53:01.096
But what good is saved time if nobody uses it,
if it just turns into more busy work?

53:01.179 --> 53:02.222
- Yeah.
- Right?

53:02.305 --> 53:06.476
You never hear somebody say, "With the time
I've saved by using my word processor,

53:06.559 --> 53:08.978
I'm gonna go to a Zen monastery
and hang out."

53:09.062 --> 53:10.563
-(Celine laughs)
- You don't hear that.

53:10.647 --> 53:12.941
Time is abstract anyway.

53:13.024 --> 53:15.610
- Were you looking at this girl?
- What?

53:15.694 --> 53:17.696
(Celine laughs)

53:17.779 --> 53:19.531
- You want to go in here?
- What?

53:19.614 --> 53:22.659
- You want to go in here?
- Yeah. It's a club, no?

53:22.742 --> 53:24.244
Yeah.

53:25.203 --> 53:26.371
- You want to go?
- Yeah.

53:26.454 --> 53:27.831
Hello.

53:27.914 --> 53:30.208

53:30.291 --> 53:31.793
- Fifty schillings.
- Each.

53:31.876 --> 53:35.046
I got a hundred. Here. I got it.

53:35.130 --> 53:37.257

54:59.589 --> 55:01.800
Well, um -

55:01.883 --> 55:05.845
We haven't talked about this yet,
but are you dating anyone?

55:05.929 --> 55:10.433
You got a boyfriend waiting on you
back in Paris or anything like that?

55:10.517 --> 55:13.144
- No, not right now.
- Not right - But you did.

55:14.604 --> 55:16.689
We broke up about six months ago.

55:16.773 --> 55:17.982
- Six months?
- Yeah.

55:18.066 --> 55:19.317
Oh, I'm sorry.

55:19.400 --> 55:22.070
I mean, I'm not that sorry.
But tell me about him.

55:22.153 --> 55:24.489
Oh, no. No way. I can't.

55:24.572 --> 55:27.951
- It's really - really boring.
- Come on, tell me about him.

55:29.077 --> 55:32.121
Okay. I was really disappointed.

55:32.205 --> 55:34.165
I thought this one would last for a while.

55:34.249 --> 55:38.461
I mean, he was very stupid,
ugly, bad in bed,

55:38.545 --> 55:41.297
alcoholic, you know.

55:41.381 --> 55:44.217
- A real prizewinner.
- Yeah. (laughing)

55:44.300 --> 55:46.928
I was kind of giving him a favor,
but he left me,

55:47.011 --> 55:48.930
saying I loved him too much

55:49.013 --> 55:52.934
and, you know, I was blocking
his artistic expression and stuff.

55:53.017 --> 55:54.811
Shit like that, you know.

55:54.894 --> 55:57.313
But anyway, I was traumatized and became -

55:57.397 --> 56:00.441
(sighs) And became
totally obsessed with him.

56:00.525 --> 56:04.445
And so I went to see this shrink, you know,
and it came up that I had written

56:04.529 --> 56:08.533
this little, stupid story about this woman
trying to kill her boyfriend...

56:09.617 --> 56:13.246
and how she was gonna do it,
you know, all the intricate details.

56:13.329 --> 56:16.666
- How to do it and not get caught.
- She was gonna kill her boyfriend?

56:16.749 --> 56:18.126
Yeah. (laughing)

56:18.209 --> 56:20.587
Yeah, she was. I mean -

56:20.670 --> 56:23.590
It's nothing I would do,
but it was just some writing.

56:23.673 --> 56:25.091
No, I understand.

56:25.174 --> 56:27.760
Anyway, this stupid shrink believed
everything I was telling her.

56:27.844 --> 56:29.804
It was my first time seeing her.

56:29.888 --> 56:33.224
- She said she <i>had</i> to call the police.
- She had to call the police?

56:33.308 --> 56:38.021
She was ― <i>Merde!</i> She was totally
convinced I was really gonna do it.

56:38.104 --> 56:41.190
Even though I'd explained to her
it was just some writing and stuff.

56:41.274 --> 56:44.444
She said, looking deep into my eyes,
"The way you said it.

56:44.527 --> 56:47.238
I know you are going to do it,
the way you said it!"

56:47.322 --> 56:49.782
- She was totally out of her mind.
- Aaah!

56:49.866 --> 56:52.368
It was my first and last session.

56:52.452 --> 56:54.495
So what happened then?

56:54.579 --> 56:56.205
Hmm.

56:56.289 --> 56:58.458
I totally got over him, you know.

56:58.541 --> 57:04.422
But now I'm obsessed that he's gonna die
from an accident a thousand kilometers away.

57:04.505 --> 57:07.091
- Oh, right.
- I'm gonna be the one accused.

57:09.928 --> 57:14.015
Why is it you become obsessed with people
you don't really like that much?

57:14.098 --> 57:16.434
- You know what I mean?
- I don't know.

57:18.603 --> 57:20.688
So how about you?

57:21.522 --> 57:23.983
- What?
- Are you with anyone?

57:24.067 --> 57:25.777
Um -

57:25.860 --> 57:29.489
It's funny how we managed
to avoid this subject for so long.

57:29.572 --> 57:31.658
Yeah, but now you have to tell me.

57:31.741 --> 57:36.496
Well, I kind of see love
as this escape for two people

57:36.579 --> 57:38.414
who don't know how to be alone, you know?

57:38.498 --> 57:40.667
Or, uh - You know what's funny?

57:40.750 --> 57:45.672
People always talk about how love
is this totally unselfish, giving thing.

57:45.755 --> 57:49.133
But if you think about it,
there's nothing more selfish.

57:49.217 --> 57:50.843
Yeah, I know.

57:52.011 --> 57:53.888
So, who just broke up with you?

57:55.807 --> 57:57.308
What?

57:59.310 --> 58:01.646
You sound like you've just been hurt
or something.

58:01.729 --> 58:03.398
- Oh, do I?
- Yeah.

58:03.481 --> 58:05.024
All right, um -

58:05.775 --> 58:07.777
A big confession, you know?

58:07.860 --> 58:10.405
I should have told you this earlier
or something, but...

58:11.572 --> 58:16.285
I didn't come to Europe just to hang out
and read Hemingway in Paris

58:16.369 --> 58:18.246
and shit like that, you know.

58:18.329 --> 58:21.624
I saved up my money all spring
to fly to Madrid

58:21.708 --> 58:24.335
and spend the summer
with my girlfriend who has been -

58:24.419 --> 58:26.337
- Your girlfriend?
- My ex-girlfriend.

58:26.421 --> 58:29.799
Who's been in this asinine
art history program for the last year.

58:29.882 --> 58:33.469
Anyway, I got here, right,
and we were reunited at long last,

58:33.553 --> 58:37.724
and we went out to dinner our first night
with six of her friends -

58:37.807 --> 58:40.643
Pedro, Antonio, Gonzalo,

58:40.727 --> 58:43.021
Maria, Suzy from home, you know?

58:43.104 --> 58:46.691
She pretty much managed to avoid being
alone with me for the first couple of days,

58:46.774 --> 58:49.777
and I stuck around for a while
just to kinda let it really sink in

58:49.861 --> 58:52.363
that she wished I hadn't come.

58:53.156 --> 58:55.158
So I bought the cheapest flight
out of Europe,

58:55.241 --> 58:58.494
this one leaving out of Vienna tomorrow,
but it didn't leave for a couple of weeks,

58:58.578 --> 59:01.122
so I bought this Eurail pass, you know.

59:01.205 --> 59:04.751
You know what's the worst thing
about somebody breaking up with you?

59:06.794 --> 59:09.756
- Yeah?
- It's when you remember how little you thought

59:09.839 --> 59:11.883
about the people you broke up with

59:11.966 --> 59:15.970
and you realize that that is how little
they're thinking about you.

59:16.054 --> 59:17.597
- Oh. (chuckling)
- You know?

59:17.680 --> 59:20.725
You'd like to think that you're both
in all this pain, but really, they're just,

59:20.808 --> 59:22.643
-"Hey, I'm glad you're gone."
-(laughing)

59:22.727 --> 59:25.229
Believe me, I know.

59:25.313 --> 59:28.900
- You should look at bright colors.
- What?

59:28.983 --> 59:31.110
That's what the shrink told me, you know?

59:31.194 --> 59:36.282
I was paying her 900 francs an hour
to hear that I was a homicidal maniac,

59:36.365 --> 59:40.328
but I could perhaps shift my obsession
if I would concentrate on bright colors.

59:40.411 --> 59:42.455
Well, did it work?

59:42.538 --> 59:44.040
Well -

59:45.541 --> 59:48.086
- It didn't help your pinball.
- Well, no. (laughing)

59:48.169 --> 59:52.131
Yeah, well, you know,
I mean, I haven't killed anyone lately.

59:52.215 --> 59:53.841
- Not lately?
- Mmm.

59:53.925 --> 59:55.927
Well, that's good. You're cured then.

01:00:02.016 --> 01:00:07.188
I mean, there's these breeds of monkeys, right?
And all they do is have sex, like, all the time.

01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:12.026
And, uh, they turn out to be the least violent,
the most peaceful, the most happy -

01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:15.530
You know? So, I mean,
maybe foolin' around's not so bad.

01:00:15.613 --> 01:00:18.366
- Are you talking about monkeys?
- Yes, I'm talking about monkeys.

01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:20.535
- Ah, I thought so. Yeah. You know?
- Why?

01:00:20.618 --> 01:00:24.372
I never heard this one,
but it reminds me of this perfect, you know,

01:00:24.455 --> 01:00:26.874
male argument
to justify them fooling around.

01:00:26.958 --> 01:00:28.960
No, no, no!
Women monkeys are foolin' around too.

01:00:29.043 --> 01:00:30.545
- Everybody's fooling around.
-(groans)

01:00:30.628 --> 01:00:33.047
- Ooh! Ooh!
- Yeah - That's cute.

01:00:33.131 --> 01:00:38.761
You know, I have this awful, paranoid thought
that feminism was mostly invented by men

01:00:38.845 --> 01:00:41.055
so they could, like,
fool around a little more.

01:00:41.139 --> 01:00:44.392
You know, "Woman, free your mind.
Free your body. Sleep with me.

01:00:44.475 --> 01:00:47.770
We're all happy and free as long
as I can fuck as much as I can."

01:00:47.854 --> 01:00:50.731
- Ah! All right, all right.
- I'm sure.

01:00:50.815 --> 01:00:53.609
But maybe, maybe there's
some biological things at work here.

01:00:53.693 --> 01:00:55.653
- Biological.
-If you had an island, right?

01:00:55.736 --> 01:00:56.737
Yeah?

01:00:56.821 --> 01:01:00.908
And there were 99 women on the island
and only one man,

01:01:00.992 --> 01:01:03.703
in a year you'd have
the possibility of 99 babies.

01:01:03.786 --> 01:01:04.787
Right.

01:01:04.871 --> 01:01:07.707
But if you have an island with 99 <i>men</i>
and only one woman,

01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:10.585
in a year you have the possibility
of only one baby.

01:01:10.668 --> 01:01:13.045
- So -
- So - You know what?

01:01:13.129 --> 01:01:15.047
- What?
- On this island, you know,

01:01:15.131 --> 01:01:17.967
I think there will be only,
like, maybe 43 men left

01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:20.887
because they would have killed each other
trying to fuck this poor woman.

01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:22.430
You know what I mean?

01:01:22.513 --> 01:01:26.392
And on the other island,
there would be 99 women, 99 babies,

01:01:26.475 --> 01:01:28.311
and no more men

01:01:28.394 --> 01:01:31.105
because they would have all
gotten together and eaten him alive.

01:01:31.189 --> 01:01:34.609
Oh, yeah? Yeah?
See, I think there's something to that.

01:01:34.692 --> 01:01:38.571
I think on some level, women don't mind
the idea of destroying a man.

01:01:38.654 --> 01:01:42.867
Like, I was once walking down the street
with my ex-girlfriend, right?

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:47.788
We just walked by these real ―
four thuggy-looking guys next to a Camaro.

01:01:47.872 --> 01:01:51.167
And, uh, one of 'em sure enough
says, "Hey, baby, nice ass."

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:54.921
So I'm like, "All right. No big deal.
I'm not gonna get uptight about this."

01:01:55.004 --> 01:01:58.132
- Yeah, plus, you know, there were four of them.
- Yeah, exactly. There's four of 'em.

01:01:58.216 --> 01:02:00.218
But she turns around,
she says, "Fuck you, dickheads!"

01:02:00.301 --> 01:02:03.429
And I'm like,
"Okay, wait a minute here." Right?

01:02:03.512 --> 01:02:06.057
They're not gonna come and kick <i>her</i> ass.
Know what I mean?

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:09.560
So who just got pushed to the front line
on that one? You see what I'm saying?

01:02:09.644 --> 01:02:12.521
I mean, women say they hate it
if you're all territorial and protective,

01:02:12.605 --> 01:02:16.984
but if it suits them, then they'll tell you
you're being all unmanly or wimpy.

01:02:17.068 --> 01:02:21.906
You know what? I don't think women
really wants to destroy men. And if -

01:02:21.989 --> 01:02:24.867
Even if they want to, they don't succeed.
You know what I mean?

01:02:24.951 --> 01:02:27.119
I'm sure even men are destroying women -

01:02:27.203 --> 01:02:30.331
or are capable of destroying women
much more than women.

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:32.833
Well, anyway -
It's depressing. You know what?

01:02:32.917 --> 01:02:35.544
- What? You wanna stop talking about this?
- Yeah. I hate it.

01:02:35.628 --> 01:02:38.464
- Okay. Well, over it.
- You know, man-woman. There's no end to this.

01:02:38.547 --> 01:02:41.300
- Like - You know.
- It's like a skipping record, you know?

01:02:41.384 --> 01:02:42.426
(laughs) Yeah.

01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:45.596
Every couple's been having
this conversation forever.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.307
And nobody came up with anything.

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.867
I saw a documentary on that.
It's a birth dance.

01:03:06.951 --> 01:03:09.036
- A birth dance.
- Yeah.

01:03:36.939 --> 01:03:39.066
- Should I give her some money?
- Yeah.

01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:42.236
JESSE: Everything that's interesting
costs a little bit of money.

01:03:43.988 --> 01:03:48.617
So a birth dance, huh?
Looked a little bit like a mating dance to me.

01:03:48.701 --> 01:03:51.662
No, but really,
women used it when giving birth.

01:03:51.746 --> 01:03:54.206
In some part of the world,
they still do it.

01:03:54.290 --> 01:03:55.499
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:03:55.583 --> 01:03:58.002
The woman in labor enters a tent,

01:03:58.085 --> 01:04:00.921
and the women of her tribe
surround her and dance,

01:04:01.005 --> 01:04:03.341
and they encourage the birthing woman
to dance with them

01:04:03.424 --> 01:04:05.718
-so as to make the birth less painful.
- Yeah?

01:04:05.801 --> 01:04:09.096
And when the baby's born,
they all dance in celebration.

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:12.058
Wow. I don't think my mom
would've gone for that.

01:04:13.059 --> 01:04:15.686
CELINE: I like the idea of dancing
as a common function in life,

01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:17.605
something everybody participates in.

01:04:17.688 --> 01:04:20.107
Mmm. I know. I heard about this old guy

01:04:20.191 --> 01:04:23.194
who, uh, was watching
some young people dance,

01:04:23.277 --> 01:04:25.112
and he said, "How beautiful.

01:04:25.196 --> 01:04:28.032
They're trying to shake off their genitals
and become angels."

01:04:28.115 --> 01:04:30.534
-I like that.
- All right, one question. Back there -

01:04:30.618 --> 01:04:34.288
When the women are dancing
and being all spiritual and stuff, right?

01:04:34.372 --> 01:04:36.957
Where are the men?
Are we out food gathering?

01:04:37.041 --> 01:04:40.086
Are we not invited?
Y'all don't need us? What?

01:04:40.169 --> 01:04:42.588
Men are lucky we don't bite off their head
after mating.

01:04:42.671 --> 01:04:45.466
Certain insects do that, you know?
Like spiders and stuff?

01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:47.385
- Mm-hmm.
- We at least let you live.

01:04:47.468 --> 01:04:49.095
- What are you complaining about?
- Yeah.

01:04:49.178 --> 01:04:52.264
See, you're officially kidding,
but there's somethin' to that.

01:04:52.348 --> 01:04:54.642
- You keep bringing stuff like that up.
- What?

01:04:54.725 --> 01:04:57.144
- Yeah!
- No, no, no. Wait a minute.

01:04:57.228 --> 01:04:58.854
Talking seriously here.

01:04:58.938 --> 01:05:01.482
I mean, I always feel this pressure

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:04.193
of being a strong and independent icon
of womanhood

01:05:04.276 --> 01:05:09.865
and not making - making look like
my whole life is revolving around some guy.

01:05:09.949 --> 01:05:14.286
But. . . loving someone, and being loved,

01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:16.372
means so much to me.

01:05:17.289 --> 01:05:19.375
I always make fun of it and stuff,

01:05:20.459 --> 01:05:25.256
but isn't everything we dream in life
a way to be loved a little more?

01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:29.718
Yeah.

01:05:29.802 --> 01:05:31.595
I don't know.

01:05:31.679 --> 01:05:33.889
Sometimes I dream

01:05:33.973 --> 01:05:36.934
about being a good father
and a good husband.

01:05:37.017 --> 01:05:39.728
- And sometimes that feels really close.
- Hmm.

01:05:40.438 --> 01:05:42.440
But then other times,

01:05:43.399 --> 01:05:45.359
it seems silly,

01:05:45.443 --> 01:05:48.863
like it would, uh, ruin my whole life.

01:05:49.864 --> 01:05:52.491
And it's not just a - a fear of commitment

01:05:52.575 --> 01:05:55.161
or that I'm incapable of caring or loving,

01:05:55.244 --> 01:05:57.746
because. . . I can.

01:05:58.664 --> 01:06:02.418
It's just that. . .
If I'm totally honest with myself,

01:06:03.169 --> 01:06:07.465
I think I'd rather die knowing
that I was really good at something,

01:06:07.548 --> 01:06:10.634
that I had excelled in some way.

01:06:10.718 --> 01:06:16.140
You know? Than that I'd just been
in a nice, caring relationship.

01:06:18.559 --> 01:06:20.478
Yeah.

01:06:20.561 --> 01:06:23.481
But. . . I had worked for this older man,

01:06:23.564 --> 01:06:27.026
and once he told me
that he had spent all of his life

01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:29.069
thinking about his career and his work.

01:06:29.153 --> 01:06:32.114
And. . . he was 52,
and it suddenly struck him...

01:06:32.865 --> 01:06:35.993
that he had never really given
anything of himself.

01:06:36.076 --> 01:06:38.579
His life was for no one and nothing.

01:06:39.997 --> 01:06:42.208
He was almost crying saying that.

01:06:45.377 --> 01:06:47.963
You know, I believe
if there's any kind of God,

01:06:48.047 --> 01:06:50.174
it wouldn't be in any of us -

01:06:50.257 --> 01:06:52.176
not you or me.

01:06:53.177 --> 01:06:55.346
But just this little space in between.

01:06:58.599 --> 01:07:01.393
If there's any kind of magic in this world,

01:07:01.477 --> 01:07:05.272
it must be in the attempt of understanding
someone, sharing something.

01:07:07.983 --> 01:07:10.361
I know. It's almost impossible to succeed.

01:07:10.444 --> 01:07:13.489
But. . . who cares, really?

01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:17.576
The answer must be in the attempt.

01:07:36.387 --> 01:07:38.264
(chattering)

01:07:42.977 --> 01:07:45.604
(man speaking German)

01:07:48.899 --> 01:07:51.527
(speaking German)

01:07:57.032 --> 01:07:59.326
(speaking German)

01:08:10.879 --> 01:08:13.465
(speaking German)

01:08:25.894 --> 01:08:28.314
I really think this <i>is</i>
a civilization in decline.

01:08:28.397 --> 01:08:30.024
- Look at the service.
- The service?

01:08:30.107 --> 01:08:33.359
Where is the waitress? In New York,
this person would be out of a job.

01:08:33.444 --> 01:08:35.571
(speaking German)

01:08:41.577 --> 01:08:44.121
Okay. Now I'm gonna call
my best friend in Paris,

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:46.749
who I'm supposed to
have lunch with in eight hours.

01:08:46.832 --> 01:08:48.917
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:08:50.127 --> 01:08:54.298
Dring. Dring. Dring. Dring.

01:08:54.381 --> 01:08:57.426
- Dring. Dring. Pick up!
- What?

01:08:57.509 --> 01:09:00.554
- Pick up the phone.
- Uh, oh, hello?

01:09:00.638 --> 01:09:03.098
<i>- Allô? Vani, c'est Celine.</i>
- Mm-hmm?

01:09:03.182 --> 01:09:04.642
- Ah!
<i>- Comment ça va?</i>

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:08.395
<i>Ça va bien. Et toi?</i>

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:11.857
-(speaking French rapidly)
- Ah -

01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:16.487
I-I've been workin' on my English recently.
You wanna talk in English? Just for laughs?

01:09:17.071 --> 01:09:19.365
- Yeah, okay. That's a good idea.
-(laughs)

01:09:19.448 --> 01:09:24.328
Um, I don't think I'm gonna be able
to make it for lunch today. I'm sorry.

01:09:24.411 --> 01:09:28.832
I - I met a guy on the train,
and I got off with him in Vienna.

01:09:28.916 --> 01:09:32.211
- We're still there.
- Are you crazy?

01:09:33.212 --> 01:09:35.005
Probably.

01:09:35.089 --> 01:09:37.091
Wh-What, he's Austrian? He's from there?

01:09:37.174 --> 01:09:39.926
No, no, no, no. He's passing through here too.
He's American.

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:42.054
He's going back home tomorrow morning.

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:44.598
Why'd you get off the train with him?

01:09:44.682 --> 01:09:47.017
Well, he convinced me.

01:09:48.143 --> 01:09:49.937
I mean, actually, I was -

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:54.191
I was ready to get off the train with him
after talking to him a short while.

01:09:54.274 --> 01:09:56.360
He was so sweet, I couldn't help it.

01:09:57.653 --> 01:09:59.279
We were in the lounge car,

01:09:59.363 --> 01:10:03.492
and he begin to talk about him as a little boy
seeing his great-grandmother"s ghost.

01:10:04.868 --> 01:10:07.496
I think that's when I fell for him.

01:10:08.205 --> 01:10:11.709
Just the idea of this little boy
with all those beautiful dreams.

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:16.130
- He trapped me.
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:18.298 --> 01:10:20.134
And he's so cute.

01:10:20.217 --> 01:10:24.012
He has beautiful blue eyes,
nice pink lips.

01:10:25.264 --> 01:10:29.351
Greasy hair! (laughing) I love it.

01:10:29.435 --> 01:10:32.020
He's kind of tall
and he's a little clumsy.

01:10:33.981 --> 01:10:36.650
I like to feel his eyes on me
when I look away.

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:44.533
He kind of kisses like an adolescent.
It's so cute.

01:10:44.616 --> 01:10:46.994
- What?
- Yeah, we kissed.

01:10:47.077 --> 01:10:49.037
It was so adorable.

01:10:49.121 --> 01:10:52.249
As the night went on,
I began to like him more and more.

01:10:54.084 --> 01:10:55.919
But I'm afraid he's scared of me.

01:10:56.003 --> 01:11:00.215
I told him the story about the woman
that kills her ex-boyfriend and stuff.

01:11:00.299 --> 01:11:02.134
He must be scared to death.

01:11:02.217 --> 01:11:05.345
He must be thinking
I'm this manipulative, mean woman.

01:11:07.598 --> 01:11:10.267
I just hope he doesn't
feel that way about me.

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:12.853
Because you know me.
I'm the most harmless person.

01:11:14.772 --> 01:11:17.691
The only person
I could really hurt is myself.

01:11:18.609 --> 01:11:20.611
I don't think he's scared of you.

01:11:20.694 --> 01:11:23.739
- I think he's crazy about you.
- Really?

01:11:23.822 --> 01:11:26.742
I've known you a long time,
and I got a good feeling.

01:11:26.825 --> 01:11:29.036
You gonna see him again?

01:11:30.329 --> 01:11:32.247
We haven't talked about that yet.

01:11:37.753 --> 01:11:39.963
Okay. It's your turn.
You call your friend.

01:11:40.047 --> 01:11:42.007
- Okay?
- Uh - All right, all right.

01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:44.176
Um - Uh -

01:11:44.927 --> 01:11:49.431
Bring, bring, bring. I usually get
this guy's answering machine. Brrring !

01:11:51.225 --> 01:11:52.893
Hi, dude. What's up?

01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:55.979
- Uh - Hey, Frank, how ya been?
-(laughing)

01:11:56.063 --> 01:11:57.815
Glad you're home.

01:11:57.898 --> 01:12:01.068
Cool. Yeah. So how was Madrid?

01:12:01.151 --> 01:12:03.487
Uh, Madrid sucked.

01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:07.199
Uh, you know, Lisa and I
had our long-overdue meltdown.

01:12:07.908 --> 01:12:09.910
Oh, too bad. I told you, no?

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:13.038
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The long-distance thing just never works.

01:12:13.121 --> 01:12:15.374
I was only in Madrid for a couple days.

01:12:15.457 --> 01:12:17.835
And I got a cheaper flight out of Vienna,

01:12:17.918 --> 01:12:19.920
but, uh,

01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:22.047
you know, it really
wasn't that much cheaper.

01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:25.843
I just, uh -
I couldn't go home right away.

01:12:25.926 --> 01:12:27.761
I didn't wanna see anybody I knew.

01:12:27.845 --> 01:12:30.305
I just wanted to be a ghost,
completely anonymous.

01:12:32.349 --> 01:12:33.976
- So are you okay now?
- Yeah.

01:12:34.059 --> 01:12:37.145
Yeah. No, no. Yeah!
I'm great. I'm great. That's the thing.

01:12:37.229 --> 01:12:38.564
I'm rapturous.

01:12:39.356 --> 01:12:40.983
And I'll tell you why.

01:12:41.066 --> 01:12:43.986
I met somebody on my last night in Europe.
Can you believe that?

01:12:44.069 --> 01:12:46.864
- That's incredible.
- I know. I know.

01:12:46.947 --> 01:12:50.325
And you know how they say we're all
each other"s demons and angels?

01:12:51.326 --> 01:12:54.288
Well, she was literally a Botticelli angel,

01:12:54.371 --> 01:12:57.583
just tellin' me that
everything was gonna be okay.

01:13:00.252 --> 01:13:01.753
How did you meet?

01:13:03.255 --> 01:13:05.132
- On the train.
- Hmm.

01:13:05.215 --> 01:13:09.761
She was sittin' next to this very weird couple
that started fighting, so she had to move.

01:13:09.845 --> 01:13:12.014
She sat right across the aisle from me.

01:13:12.097 --> 01:13:14.224
So we started to talk.

01:13:14.308 --> 01:13:16.643
And, uh, she didn't like me much at first.

01:13:16.727 --> 01:13:19.438
She's super-smart, very passionate,

01:13:19.521 --> 01:13:22.399
um, and beautiful.

01:13:23.817 --> 01:13:26.695
And I was so unsure of myself.

01:13:26.778 --> 01:13:29.156
I thought everything I said
sounded so stupid.

01:13:31.241 --> 01:13:34.369
Aw, man, I wouldn't worry about that.

01:13:34.453 --> 01:13:37.247
- Nah.
- Nah, I'm sure she was not judging you.

01:13:37.956 --> 01:13:40.208
No. And by the way,
she sat next to you, no?

01:13:40.292 --> 01:13:42.669
- I'm sure she did it in purpose.
- Oh, yeah?

01:13:42.753 --> 01:13:45.213
Yeah. (laughs)

01:13:47.215 --> 01:13:50.177
Us men are so stupid.
We don't understand anything about women.

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:52.095
Mm-mmm.

01:13:52.179 --> 01:13:54.848
They act kind of strange,
the little I know of them.

01:13:55.432 --> 01:13:56.934
Don't they?

01:13:58.352 --> 01:13:59.853
Yeah.

01:14:03.774 --> 01:14:07.778
I feel like this is some dream world
we're in, you know?

01:14:07.861 --> 01:14:09.821
Yeah, it's so weird.

01:14:09.905 --> 01:14:13.825
It's like our time together is just ours.
It's our own creation.

01:14:14.785 --> 01:14:17.871
It must be like I'm in your dream
and you're in mine or something.

01:14:17.955 --> 01:14:19.247
Mm-hmm.

01:14:19.331 --> 01:14:23.418
And what's so cool is that this whole evening,
all our time together,

01:14:23.502 --> 01:14:25.879
shouldn't officially be happening.

01:14:25.963 --> 01:14:29.174
Yeah, I know. Maybe that's why
this feels so otherworldly.

01:14:31.593 --> 01:14:34.763
But then the morning comes
and we turn into pumpkins, right?

01:14:34.846 --> 01:14:37.599
- Aaah!
-(laughing) I know.

01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:43.647
But at this time, I think you're supposed to
produce the glass slipper and see if it fits.

01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:46.024
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:14:46.108 --> 01:14:47.734
It'll fit.

01:15:05.794 --> 01:15:08.922
JESSE: This friend of mine had a kid,
and it was a home birth,

01:15:09.006 --> 01:15:11.258
so he was there
helping out and everything.

01:15:11.341 --> 01:15:14.344
But he said at that profound
moment of birth -

01:15:14.428 --> 01:15:19.224
Uh, he was watching his child
experiencing life for the first time,

01:15:19.307 --> 01:15:21.685
trying to take its first breath.

01:15:21.768 --> 01:15:25.397
All he could think about was
that he was lookin' at somethin'

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:27.691
that was gonna die someday.

01:15:27.774 --> 01:15:30.402
He just couldn't get it out of his head.

01:15:30.485 --> 01:15:34.364
And I think that's so true.
You know, everything is so finite.

01:15:34.448 --> 01:15:37.409
I mean, but - but don't you think
that's what, um,

01:15:37.492 --> 01:15:40.996
makes our time and specific moments
so important?

01:15:41.079 --> 01:15:44.249
Yeah, I know.
It's the same for us tonight though.

01:15:47.461 --> 01:15:51.173
After tomorrow morning, we're probably
never gonna see each other again, right?

01:15:53.091 --> 01:15:55.302
You don't think
we'll ever see each other again?

01:15:57.763 --> 01:15:59.264
What do you think?

01:16:00.682 --> 01:16:03.518
Well - Um -

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:07.773
Gosh, I don't know. Uh -

01:16:07.856 --> 01:16:10.567
-I mean, I hadn't planned another trip to -
- Uh, me too.

01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:13.779
I mean, I live in Paris.
You live in the US. I totally understand -

01:16:13.862 --> 01:16:16.156
I'd hate to make you fly.
You hate to fly, right?

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:18.366
I'm not so scared of flying.

01:16:19.451 --> 01:16:23.371
- I mean, I could.
- Well, if you were gonna come to the US

01:16:23.455 --> 01:16:25.832
or if, you know - I mean, if I -

01:16:25.916 --> 01:16:29.252
Or you know, I mean,
I could come back here.

01:16:29.336 --> 01:16:31.463
What? What?

01:16:31.546 --> 01:16:34.382
No, let's just be rational adults
about this.

01:16:35.467 --> 01:16:37.511
We -

01:16:37.594 --> 01:16:39.596
Maybe we should try something different.

01:16:39.679 --> 01:16:42.849
I mean, it's not so bad
if tonight is our only night, right?

01:16:44.101 --> 01:16:46.311

phone numbers, addresses.

01:16:46.394 --> 01:16:49.231

calling each other once or twice.

Right. Fizzles out.

01:16:51.316 --> 01:16:53.860

are supposed to last forever anyway?

<i>Trapeze, come on, baby</i>

01:19:30.684 --> 01:19:32.269
Hello.

01:19:32.352 --> 01:19:34.396
- BARTENDER: Hello.
- Uh -

01:19:36.064 --> 01:19:38.233
- Do you speak English?
- Mmm. A bit.

01:19:38.316 --> 01:19:40.402
- Yeah? A bit? Well - All right.
- Yeah.

01:19:40.485 --> 01:19:44.281
I'm having kind of an odd situation,
which is that, um -

01:19:44.364 --> 01:19:46.783
Uh - This is -
You see that girl over there?

01:19:50.203 --> 01:19:53.498
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Well, this is our only night together.

01:19:53.581 --> 01:19:57.669
Um, and she, uh -

01:19:57.752 --> 01:20:01.256
All right. Here's the problem. The problem
is that she wants a bottle of red wine.

01:20:01.339 --> 01:20:04.175
And I don't have any money.
You see? (laughing)

01:20:05.927 --> 01:20:08.471
But what I was thinkin' was
that you might wanna, um,

01:20:09.306 --> 01:20:11.433
uh, give me the address of this bar -

01:20:11.516 --> 01:20:14.227
No. I know. And I would promise
to send you the money.

01:20:14.311 --> 01:20:16.563
And you'd be making our night complete.

01:20:16.646 --> 01:20:19.482
- You would send me the money?
- Yes.

01:20:25.071 --> 01:20:26.573
Your hand?

01:20:28.366 --> 01:20:30.410
Okay.

01:20:30.493 --> 01:20:32.996
<i>Trapeze</i>

01:20:33.079 --> 01:20:36.207
<i>Youplayed a two-facedgame</i>
<i>l'llnever feel the same </i>

01:20:36.291 --> 01:20:40.670

01:20:40.754 --> 01:20:42.630
<i>Good-bye, romance</i>

01:20:42.714 --> 01:20:44.924
For the greatest night in your life.

01:20:45.008 --> 01:20:47.427
Thank you very much.

01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:49.429
<i>Trapeze</i>

01:21:10.533 --> 01:21:13.870
So often in my life I've been with people
and shared beautiful moments

01:21:13.953 --> 01:21:17.957
like traveling or staying up all night
and watching the sunrise,

01:21:19.334 --> 01:21:21.586
and I knew those were special moments.

01:21:22.462 --> 01:21:24.464
But something was always wrong.

01:21:25.799 --> 01:21:27.884
I wished I'd been with someone else.

01:21:29.761 --> 01:21:34.182
I knew that what I was feeling,
exactly what was so important to me,

01:21:34.265 --> 01:21:36.267
they didn't understand.

01:21:40.897 --> 01:21:43.024
But I'm happy to be with you.

01:21:45.610 --> 01:21:48.279
You couldn't possibly know
why a night like this

01:21:48.363 --> 01:21:50.990
is so important to my life right now,

01:21:51.074 --> 01:21:52.700
but it is.

01:21:55.495 --> 01:21:57.914
This is a great morning.

01:21:57.997 --> 01:21:59.999
It <i>is</i> a great morning.

01:22:02.127 --> 01:22:04.504
Do you think we'll have others like this?

01:22:06.798 --> 01:22:10.510
- What?
- What about our rational, adult decision?

01:22:10.593 --> 01:22:13.388
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:22:16.766 --> 01:22:19.561
I know what you mean about wishing
that somebody wasn't there though.

01:22:19.644 --> 01:22:20.979
Hmm?

01:22:21.062 --> 01:22:24.899
It's just usually, it's myself
that I wish I could get away from.

01:22:26.109 --> 01:22:28.319
Seriously, think about this.

01:22:28.403 --> 01:22:32.157
I have never been anywhere
that I haven't been.

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:33.241
Hmm.

01:22:33.324 --> 01:22:37.954
I've never, uh, had a kiss
when I wasn't one of the kissers.

01:22:38.037 --> 01:22:42.667
You know, I've never, um, gone to the movies
when I wasn't there in the audience.

01:22:43.668 --> 01:22:47.839
I never been out bowling if I wasn't there,
you know, makin' some stupid joke.

01:22:47.922 --> 01:22:50.967
I think that's why so many people
hate themselves. Seriously.

01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:55.680
It's just that they are sick to death
of being around themselves.

01:22:56.473 --> 01:23:00.143
Let's say you and I
were together all the time.

01:23:00.226 --> 01:23:02.562
You'd start to hate
a lot of my mannerisms...

01:23:03.271 --> 01:23:07.942
and the way, uh - the way every time
that we would have people over, uh,

01:23:08.776 --> 01:23:11.529
I'd be insecure
and I'd get a little too drunk.

01:23:11.613 --> 01:23:17.952
Or, uh, the way I tell the same stupid,
pseudo-intellectual story again and again.

01:23:19.746 --> 01:23:22.373
You see, I've heard all those stories.

01:23:22.457 --> 01:23:24.959
So, of course I'm sick of myself.

01:23:26.419 --> 01:23:27.670
But...

01:23:29.214 --> 01:23:31.174
being with you, uh,

01:23:32.967 --> 01:23:35.345
has made me feel like I was somebody else.

01:23:37.222 --> 01:23:41.184
And the only other way
to lose yourself like that is, um,

01:23:42.185 --> 01:23:46.481
you know, dancing or alcohol or...

01:23:47.482 --> 01:23:49.817
drugs and stuff like that.

01:23:52.779 --> 01:23:55.156
Fucking?

01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:58.868
- Fu ― Fucking. Yeah. That's one way. Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:24:12.757 --> 01:24:14.717
Do you know what I want?

01:24:15.802 --> 01:24:17.220
What?

01:24:20.348 --> 01:24:22.141
To be kissed.

01:24:25.353 --> 01:24:27.188
Well, I can do that.

01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:42.954
Wait. Wait.

01:24:43.037 --> 01:24:46.249
(sighs heavily)

01:24:46.332 --> 01:24:48.376
I have to say something stupid.

01:24:49.544 --> 01:24:50.962
All right.

01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:55.216
- It's very stupid.
- Okay.

01:24:57.135 --> 01:24:59.345
I don't think we should sleep together.

01:25:01.598 --> 01:25:05.143
I mean, I want to, but since we're
never gonna see each other again,

01:25:06.269 --> 01:25:08.271
it'll make me feel bad.

01:25:09.230 --> 01:25:11.899
I'll wonder who else you're with.
I'll miss you.

01:25:17.322 --> 01:25:19.866
I know. It's not very adult.

01:25:19.949 --> 01:25:22.535
Maybe it's a female thing.
I can't help it.

01:25:23.453 --> 01:25:25.455
Let's see each other again.

01:25:27.582 --> 01:25:31.419
No, I don't want you to break our vow
just so you can get laid.

01:25:32.378 --> 01:25:35.340
I don't wanna just get laid.
I want to, um -

01:25:35.423 --> 01:25:38.718
I mean - I mean, I think we should.

01:25:40.219 --> 01:25:42.388
I mean, we die in the morning, right?

01:25:43.681 --> 01:25:46.726
- I think we should.
- No. Then it's like some male fantasy.

01:25:46.809 --> 01:25:50.355
Meet a French girl on the train,
fuck her and never see her again.

01:25:50.438 --> 01:25:53.066
This great story to tell.
I don't wanna be a great story.

01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:56.110
I don't want this great evening
to just have been for that.

01:25:56.194 --> 01:25:57.570
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:25:57.654 --> 01:26:01.074
Okay. We don't have to have sex.
It's not a big deal.

01:26:03.451 --> 01:26:04.952
Okay.

01:26:12.001 --> 01:26:14.170
You don't wanna see me again?

01:26:15.421 --> 01:26:17.256
No, of course I do. Listen.

01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:19.801
If somebody gave me the choice right now

01:26:19.884 --> 01:26:22.512
of to never see you again or to marry you,

01:26:22.595 --> 01:26:24.347
I would marry you, all right?

01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:26.474
And maybe that's
a lot of romantic bullshit,

01:26:26.557 --> 01:26:28.893
but people have gotten married
for a lot less.

01:26:32.689 --> 01:26:35.066
Actually -

01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:40.071
(sighs) I think I decided I wanted to sleep
with you when we got off the train.

01:26:43.908 --> 01:26:46.327
Now that we've talked so much,
I don't know anymore.

01:26:46.411 --> 01:26:49.163
- Oh, God.
-(laughing) What?

01:26:57.672 --> 01:27:00.133
Why do I make everything so complicated?

01:27:00.216 --> 01:27:02.051
I don't know.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.627

you're gonna do when you get back to Paris?

Call my parents. What about you?

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:15.416
I don't know. I'll probably go pick up my dog.
He's stayin' with a friend of mine.

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:17.627
- You have a dog? I love dogs.
- Yeah. You do?

01:28:17.710 --> 01:28:20.379
- Yeah.
- Oh. Oh, shit.

01:28:20.463 --> 01:28:22.089
- What?
- Oh!

01:28:22.173 --> 01:28:24.759
I don't know. We're back in real time.

01:28:24.842 --> 01:28:26.928
I know. I hate that.

01:28:27.011 --> 01:28:28.971
What is that?

01:28:30.473 --> 01:28:32.683
Sounds like a harpsichord.

01:28:32.767 --> 01:28:37.063
- Oh, check that out.
-(whispers) Somebody's playing.

01:28:37.146 --> 01:28:38.648
Shh.

01:28:43.069 --> 01:28:44.570
(whispers) That's cool.

01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:00.962
What?

JESSE: You ever danced to a harpsichord?

01:29:05.758 --> 01:29:07.176
Of course.

01:29:10.888 --> 01:29:14.100
- Oh, wow.
- What?

01:29:14.183 --> 01:29:17.937
Uh - I'm gonna take your picture...

01:29:19.313 --> 01:29:21.232
so I never forget you

01:29:21.315 --> 01:29:24.777
or, uh - or all this.

01:29:25.570 --> 01:29:27.280
Okay. Me too.

Nothin'. Nothin'.

01:30:37.975 --> 01:30:42.647
I have this, uh, recording of Dylan Thomas

01:30:42.730 --> 01:30:44.899
reading a W.H. Auden poem.

01:30:44.982 --> 01:30:47.234
He's got a great voice.

01:30:47.318 --> 01:30:49.236
He just -

01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:51.948
- It's like -
- Hmm? What?

01:30:52.031 --> 01:30:57.411

You cannot conquer time.

In headaches and in worry,

01:31:05.336 --> 01:31:08.339
vaguely life leaks away,

01:31:09.090 --> 01:31:11.175
and time will have his fancy

01:31:11.258 --> 01:31:13.928
tomorrow or today."

01:31:14.011 --> 01:31:16.764
-(chuckles)
- Somethin' like that.

01:31:16.847 --> 01:31:18.349
It's good.

01:31:25.648 --> 01:31:29.652
When you talked earlier
about after a few years

01:31:29.735 --> 01:31:31.737
how a couple
would begin to hate each other

01:31:31.821 --> 01:31:36.534
by anticipating their reactions
or getting tired of their mannerisms,

01:31:37.618 --> 01:31:40.830
I think it would be the opposite for me.

01:31:40.913 --> 01:31:45.418
I think I can really fall in love
when I know everything about someone -

01:31:46.711 --> 01:31:50.715
The way he's gonna part his hair,
which shirt he's gonna wear that day,

01:31:50.798 --> 01:31:54.552
knowing the exact story
he'd tell in a given situation.

01:31:56.804 --> 01:31:59.306
I'm sure that's when I know
I'm really in love.

01:32:20.911 --> 01:32:22.955
- Hey, guess what.
- What?

01:32:23.748 --> 01:32:25.875
We didn't go to those guys' play.

01:32:25.958 --> 01:32:27.376
- Play?
- Yeah.

01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:28.878
- The cow?
- Yeah.

01:32:28.961 --> 01:32:32.757
(laughs) Oh, yeah, we didn't.
Oh, no. We missed it.

(man speaking German on PA)

01:32:58.657 --> 01:33:01.118
Okay. You know what bus
you're taking to the airport, right?

01:33:01.202 --> 01:33:03.204
- Yeah, no problem.
- I should get on this one.

01:33:03.287 --> 01:33:05.331
- Right here? You wanna get on that one?
- Yeah.

01:33:05.414 --> 01:33:07.291
Um -

01:33:07.374 --> 01:33:09.210
Okay.

01:33:09.293 --> 01:33:11.837
- I guess this is it, no?
- Yeah.

01:33:12.588 --> 01:33:14.215
Um, I really -

-l-l -

01:33:18.219 --> 01:33:20.137
I mean - You know.

01:33:20.221 --> 01:33:22.515
- Yeah, I know. Me too.
-(man speaking on PA)

01:33:24.058 --> 01:33:25.559
I -

01:33:26.519 --> 01:33:28.604
My - Yeah.

01:33:28.687 --> 01:33:31.649
Have a great life.
Have fun with everything you're gonna do.

01:33:31.732 --> 01:33:34.276
All right, all right.
Good luck with school and all that.

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:35.861
Okay.

01:33:35.945 --> 01:33:38.155
Well, I hate this.

01:33:38.239 --> 01:33:40.658
- Me too. The train is about to leave.
- Yeah.

01:33:48.624 --> 01:33:53.170
Listen. All this bullshit we were talkin' about ―
about not seeing each other again?

01:33:53.254 --> 01:33:55.548
- I don't wanna do that.
- I don't wanna do that either.

01:33:55.631 --> 01:33:58.008
- You don't either?
- I was waiting for you to say -

01:33:58.092 --> 01:34:01.220
- Why didn't you say something?
- I was afraid maybe you didn't want to see me.

01:34:01.303 --> 01:34:03.931
Listen, what do you wanna do?

01:34:04.014 --> 01:34:07.226
Maybe - Maybe we should meet here
in five years or something.

01:34:07.309 --> 01:34:09.770
All right, all right.
Five years? Five years? That's a long time.

01:34:09.854 --> 01:34:13.065
Yes, it's awful.
It's like a sociological experiment.

01:34:13.149 --> 01:34:15.317
- How 'bout one year?
- One year. All right. All -

01:34:15.401 --> 01:34:18.320
- One - How 'bout six months?
- Six months?

01:34:18.404 --> 01:34:20.156
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be freezing.

01:34:20.239 --> 01:34:21.448
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

01:34:21.532 --> 01:34:23.742
