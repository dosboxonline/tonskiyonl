Listen up, everyone.
We had a murder this morning.

00:06.339 --> 00:08.800
The vic was found at 8:45 by a dog walker

00:08.883 --> 00:10.093
who let herself into his apartment--

00:10.176 --> 00:11.636
Oh, my God, it's Franzia!

00:11.720 --> 00:13.680
This is the work of
Johnny Franzia, my white whale.

00:13.763 --> 00:14.848
He's finally resurfaced.

00:14.931 --> 00:16.933
-Not this again.
-Yes, this again.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.768
Johnny Franzia has been on a murder spree

00:18.852 --> 00:20.228
for the past ten years,

00:20.311 --> 00:22.397
and every time
he kills someone, he taunts me.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.107
Look, there's a deck of cards.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.692
You say that whenever
there's cards at a crime scene.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.402
You know how many people own cards, Jake?

00:27.485 --> 00:29.154
Then explain this.

00:29.237 --> 00:30.989
Johnny Franzia's catchphrase
is "deuces are wild."

00:31.072 --> 00:32.323
Now look around the apartment.

00:32.407 --> 00:35.577
-Two chairs, two paintings, two pillows.
-There are three lamps.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.370
You think Franzia
gives a damn about lamps?

00:37.454 --> 00:38.872
You sound so dumb right now.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.540
This is why you don't have
an arch nemesis, Terry,

00:40.623 --> 00:42.375
because you focus
on all the wrong details.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.752
Maybe I don't have an arch nemesis

00:43.835 --> 00:46.379
because I solve all my crimes.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.971
That's a pretty [bleep]-up
thing to say to me.

I had never heard

01:26.753 --> 01:28.463
Well, it was mostly before you arrived.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.423
Actually, you're entire first year here

01:30.507 --> 01:31.883
I was convinced you were Franzia,

01:31.966 --> 01:34.552

is completely ridiculous.

01:34.636 --> 01:35.970
Or is it?

I have no investment in this back story.

01:37.847 --> 01:38.932
-Right.
-I'm taking you off the case

01:54.447 --> 01:56.407
Trust me, we've got this whole

It's true. We're great, and Mac is great.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.995
I mean, the only teeny-tiny issue

02:01.079 --> 02:02.455
is that he isn't pulling himself up yet,

02:02.539 --> 02:04.207
but the window for that
is nine to 12 months.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.084
So the fact that he's ten months
old and isn't doing it yet

02:06.167 --> 02:07.252
doesn't mean that we're bad parents.

02:07.335 --> 02:10.004

02:10.088 --> 02:12.090

02:51.379 --> 02:52.839
Why would I include travel time?

02:52.922 --> 02:54.507
It's a longer drive for me than for Kevin,

02:54.591 --> 02:56.301
so I'm putting in more effort.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.177
Hmm, I wonder why it's not going well.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.722
Well, Kevin says it's because
all I care about is work.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.932
But if that's true, why did I leave work

Okay. Great.

03:24.078 --> 03:25.413
Although I may break that promise,

But you told Terry that Franzia
didn't care about the lamps.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.385
No, he loves lamps.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.970
I was just feeling attacked,
so I lashed out,

03:41.054 --> 03:43.681
but why three identical lamps
instead of two?

03:43.765 --> 03:45.350
Because they're not actually identical.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.512
Then Kevin brings up how
Cheddar's French comprehension

07:51.596 --> 07:52.680
has regressed.

07:52.763 --> 07:54.056
Cheddar's tutor says

07:54.140 --> 07:55.641
it's because we're not
speaking enough at home.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.102
The worst part is we used to share socks.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.438
With an odd number,
that was a tense negotiation.

08:00.521 --> 08:02.064
Enough!

08:02.148 --> 08:04.525
All you do is talk about Kevin.
This needs to stop.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.444
I'm sorry-- I wish I could stop thinking

08:06.527 --> 08:08.946
about him, but he was
my husband for 20 years.

08:09.030 --> 08:12.116
If you know how I could just
erase him from my memory,

08:12.200 --> 08:13.743
I'd love to hear it.

08:13.826 --> 08:16.287
We could get really drunk.

08:16.370 --> 08:17.705
Yes, let's try that.

08:17.788 --> 08:20.541
Jake, Jake, Franzia was in my house.

08:20.625 --> 08:21.876
I didn't see anything last night,

08:21.959 --> 08:23.336
but when I showered this morning,

08:23.419 --> 08:25.171
a new riddle appeared
in the steam on the mirror.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.131
Oh, cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.591
I also saw a riddle while showering.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.259
But we didn't shower this morning.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.677
No, I know, it's just Charles
and I have this agreement

08:31.761 --> 08:33.137
that when I miss something
important on the case,

08:33.221 --> 08:35.389
he pretends like I'm still
involved-- it's normal.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.642
Anyways, I'm sure our shower
riddles were the same.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.352
No, I'm sure yours was better.

08:39.435 --> 08:40.645
Well, just to be sure,
why don't you text me yours,

08:40.728 --> 08:41.938
and I'll make sure it's the same as mine,

08:42.021 --> 08:43.105
and then we can decode it together

08:43.189 --> 08:44.774
-after Ames and I find a sitter.
-Great.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.150
Ooh, we already have three applicants.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.527
Great. Hire them.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.736
I think we should interview them first.

08:48.819 --> 08:50.363
But what if they're bad?

08:50.446 --> 08:51.697
This really feels like fate

08:51.781 --> 08:53.533
because I was arrested in this precinct

08:53.616 --> 08:55.535
literally a year ago to the day.

08:55.618 --> 08:58.371
Here, I brought a toy for the little guy.

08:58.454 --> 08:59.664
Oh, thanks. That's very nice of you.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.082
He's so soft.

09:01.165 --> 09:03.668
Your son's really gonna
enjoy cuddling him.

09:03.751 --> 09:06.003
Want to see me cuddle him?
I love cuddling.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.713
Well, this went south very quickly.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.507
I consider myself a bit of a Mary Poppins.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.050
Oh, how so?

09:11.133 --> 09:14.595
<i>♪ I'm your nanny, I'll slap your fanny ♪</i>

09:14.679 --> 09:16.097
<i>♪ Slap, slap, slap ♪</i>

09:16.180 --> 09:18.099
<i>♪ Your fat little fanny ♪</i>

09:18.182 --> 09:19.684
Yeah, it's gonna be a no.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.686
[sighs] I got to get back to Franzia,

09:21.769 --> 09:24.397
so feels like we should go
with the cuddler.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.399
No, as much as I want to work,

09:26.482 --> 09:28.067
we can't leave our son with some weirdo.

09:28.150 --> 09:29.318
[sighs]

09:29.402 --> 09:30.987
Maybe we ask someone in the precinct?

09:31.070 --> 09:32.572
Everyone's working.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.074
[both] Not everyone.

09:35.157 --> 09:36.617
Sure, I'll watch Mac.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.036
Don't worry, I've padded
all the sharp edges in here.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.454
Wow. You already baby-proofed it?

09:40.538 --> 09:41.872
Ah, it's my nap room.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.499
You can take a nap anywhere in here.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.167
Every surface is like a bed.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.336
-[both] Huh.
-Works for us.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.922
Okay. Sorry, the babysitter
thing took a little longer

09:50.006 --> 09:51.007
than I was expecting,

09:51.090 --> 09:52.341
but I solved part of the riddle.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.634
A cat has ten lives.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.595
I think the lives are numbers.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.096
Wow, that's so smart.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.181
I already solved the riddle.
It's a phone number.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.766
But you're here now. We can call together.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.018
Okay, yeah, I guess.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.686
I mean, maybe he'll have

10:03.769 --> 10:04.729
a cool scary modulated voice or something.

10:04.812 --> 10:06.772
-Yeah, yeah.
-All right.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.025
-[line trilling]
<i>-</i>[distorted voice] <i>Hello.</i>

10:09.108 --> 10:10.359
Oh, my God, he does.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.278
<i>You solved my riddle, Detective Boyle.</i>

10:12.361 --> 10:13.946
And Detective Peralta!

10:14.030 --> 10:16.532
I'm still on your tail,
and your sick game is finally--

10:16.616 --> 10:17.867
[Scully] Help! Help!

10:17.950 --> 10:19.201
Oh, seriously?

10:19.285 --> 10:21.203
Uh, Franzia, I got to go real quick.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.788
<i>What? You have to go?</i>

10:22.872 --> 10:25.041
Boyle will explain,
but I'm still on your tail.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.459
And if you think
the jokers are really wild--

10:26.542 --> 10:27.627
[Scully] Jake!

10:27.710 --> 10:29.086
All right, I'm coming! Damn it!

10:29.170 --> 10:30.254
Jake!

10:30.338 --> 10:31.631
-What happened?
-Is Mac okay?

10:31.714 --> 10:33.382
Mac's fine. It's me.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.260
There was one unpadded corner,
and I stubbed my toe real bad.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.303
Look.

10:37.386 --> 10:38.804
-Ugh!
-Oh, God!

10:38.888 --> 10:41.140
I'm sorry, I got to go to the hospital.

10:41.223 --> 10:43.267
Yeah, immediately, for so many reasons.

10:43.351 --> 10:44.894
-Come on.
-Gosh.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.730
[sighs] Is he okay?

10:47.813 --> 10:49.523
He's fine.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.359
Ames, I'm sorry, but I think
we're all out of babysitters.

10:51.442 --> 10:54.987
No. There is one option left.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.156
[gasps] His first screen
time, this is amazing.

10:57.239 --> 10:59.200
Which <i>Transformers </i>movie
should he watch first?

10:59.283 --> 11:00.534
There's an argument
to be made for <i>Bumblebee</i>,

11:00.618 --> 11:01.577
as it is a prequel.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.329
-Jake.
-All right, fine.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.122
Just let it auto-play whatever
garbage it wants, and let's go.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.333
Okay. Here you go, Mac.

11:07.416 --> 11:08.751
Here you go.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.628
[happy music playing on phone]

11:10.711 --> 11:12.963
-[crying]
-[glass shatters]

11:13.047 --> 11:14.465
[clears throat]

11:14.548 --> 11:16.300
Yeah, we deserve that.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.302
Oh, I am hungover. How you feeling?

11:18.386 --> 11:19.678
Not good at all.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.138
You were supposed
to watch out for me, Diaz.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.556
Good news is, the heavy drinking worked.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.392
You didn't mention Kevin one time.

11:24.475 --> 11:25.851
Oh, that is an accomplishment.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.354
Unfortunately, it appears

11:28.437 --> 11:31.107
that I did think about him
at least once last night.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.191
What do you mean?

11:32.274 --> 11:34.777
At 3:30 a.m., I seem to have sent Kevin…

11:36.946 --> 11:39.198
a digital phallus portrait.

11:39.281 --> 11:41.242
A digital phallus portrait? What is that?

11:41.325 --> 11:43.119
[gasps] Oh, no, you sent him
a [bleep] pic.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.582
-[Mac crying]
-Shh. Shh.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.167
Please stop crying. I'm so tired.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.794
Maybe we'd all be better rested

11:51.877 --> 11:53.546
if we hadn't woken up at 3:00 a.m.

11:53.629 --> 11:55.464
I'm sorry, I've never slept
with syrup in my hair before.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.966
I didn't know that was gonna happen.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.134
Ants! Ants in the bed!

11:58.217 --> 11:59.927
-Who?
-There's ants in the bed!

12:00.010 --> 12:01.804
There's ants! There's ants!

12:01.887 --> 12:03.472
My presentation is today,

12:03.556 --> 12:05.933
and I am not showing up in a shower cap.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.435
[sighs] What are we gonna do?

12:07.518 --> 12:09.145
There's only one thing left to do.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.565
We're gonna blow-dry these sons
of bitches straight to hell.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.151
Got to say, worked great.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.570
Although I guess my hair took
it a little better than yours.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.196
And why the glasses?

12:19.280 --> 12:21.115
Mac knocked my last contacts
into the toilet

12:21.198 --> 12:22.032
while I was blow-drying.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.951
Got to hand it to him,
it's a solid prank.

12:24.034 --> 12:26.078
Although I must say, this look
kind of works for you.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.538
Jake, we don't have time
for your nerd fetish.

12:27.621 --> 12:28.789
We are so late.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.416
I know. You know what?

12:30.499 --> 12:32.209
Let's not waste any more time
looking for babysitters.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.961
We'll just take Mac into work with us.

12:34.044 --> 12:35.629
See, Ames, we got this.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.131
Yeah, this is not gonna be hard.

12:37.214 --> 12:39.258
You want to know why?
'Cause we're great parents.

12:39.341 --> 12:41.927
In fact, we forgot Mac.
We left our child inside.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.387
-[gasps] Oh.
-Uh, get the keys.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.181
Okay, I'll take Mac first

12:45.264 --> 12:46.432
so you can start practicing
your presentation.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.766
-Okay.
-Jake, I think

12:47.850 --> 12:49.560
I figured something out about the toolbox.

12:49.643 --> 12:51.437
-Toolbox?
-Franzia sent me a toolbox.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.023
It turned out to be a puzzle.
It was so boring.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.275
Charles, it wasn't boring.
I know what you're doing.

12:56.358 --> 12:58.319
-Just tell me what happened.
-Okay, so I ran it for prints.

12:58.402 --> 13:00.112
And there was a partial on the wrench.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.864
It belongs to a guy named Eric Marsh

13:01.947 --> 13:03.741
who works as a handyman
in the victim's building.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.242
-We have to bring him in.
-Already done.

13:05.326 --> 13:06.911
He's in interrogation right now,
just waiting for you.

13:06.994 --> 13:08.871
Oh-- [sighs]

13:08.954 --> 13:10.998
But I have Mac for the next hour.

13:11.081 --> 13:13.000
I can't run an interrogation.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.877
Unless…

13:14.960 --> 13:16.212
How did your prints end up on a wrench

13:16.295 --> 13:17.838
that was sent to this police station?

13:17.922 --> 13:19.423
That wrench went missing two weeks ago.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.175
I thought someone took it
out of the back of my truck.

13:21.258 --> 13:22.927
Of course, that sounds…

13:23.010 --> 13:24.553
Totally reasonable, Eric.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.388
Or should I call you by your real name?

13:26.472 --> 13:27.806
Johnny Franzia.

13:27.890 --> 13:28.933
I don't know who that is.

13:29.016 --> 13:31.268
Uh-oh. Something stinks.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.771
Something stinks real bad.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.189
-Did you poop?
-No.

13:35.272 --> 13:37.483
You did. You pooped.

13:37.566 --> 13:39.527
Oh, God, it's everywhere.

13:39.610 --> 13:40.945
What did you eat, buddy?

13:41.028 --> 13:42.446
Today? I had some oatmeal.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.031
Here's what's gonna happen.

13:44.114 --> 13:46.700
I'm gonna lie you down,
I'm gonna take your pants off,

13:46.784 --> 13:48.202
and I'm gonna wipe your little tushy.

13:48.285 --> 13:49.453
What is going on?

13:49.537 --> 13:50.829
I actually have the same question.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.249
Hold on one second. Jake?

13:53.332 --> 13:55.125
Why did I send Kevin an obscene picture?

13:55.209 --> 13:56.377
Relax. It's not a big deal.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.753
You were just flirting.

13:57.836 --> 13:59.964
No, if I were flirting,
I would have sent him

14:00.047 --> 14:02.466
a scatter plot of educational attainment

14:02.550 --> 14:05.052
versus caloric intake in Jacobin France.

14:05.135 --> 14:08.556
This is as if I've sent him a bar graph.

14:08.639 --> 14:10.015
Are bar graphs bad?

14:10.099 --> 14:12.393
It reduces robust data sets
to a single point.

14:12.476 --> 14:13.811
Get your head out of your ass!

14:13.894 --> 14:16.480
I'm sorry-- I'm just panicking,

14:16.564 --> 14:18.274
thinking about what Kevin
will do when he sees it.

14:18.357 --> 14:19.692
Wait, you don't think he's seen it yet?

14:19.775 --> 14:21.569
No, Kevin only checks his email

14:21.652 --> 14:23.153
once a day at exactly 4:00 p.m.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.281
-You didn't text it to him?
-We're not teens.

14:25.364 --> 14:26.824
Let's delete it off his computer, then.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.158
Yes, that could work.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.703
Kevin has virtual office hours
at 2:00 p.m.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.830

We have to go to Franzia's now.

Jake has waited years for this.

Okay, style over substance is clearly out,

17:36.430 --> 17:38.098

17:50.069 --> 17:51.111
Kevin, I didn't know you were home.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.780
I came by to get a book.

17:52.863 --> 17:56.033
<i>The History of The Crusades:</i>
<i>Volume Three, 1123 to 1137.</i>

17:56.116 --> 17:58.285
-Why did you need it?
-I had an urgent question.

17:58.368 --> 17:59.787
-About what?
-The atabeg of Mosul.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.205
-Jikirmish?
-Zengi.

18:01.288 --> 18:02.790
But you already know
everything about Zengi.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.626
True, it was Diaz's question, um…

18:05.709 --> 18:07.628
and I was embarrassed for her.

18:07.711 --> 18:10.380
And what was your question, Diaz?

18:10.464 --> 18:12.633
I wanted to know who Zengi is.

18:12.716 --> 18:14.176
Yes, that is embarrassing.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.386
I can see why you tried to cover for her.

18:16.470 --> 18:17.721
Well, if that's all…

18:17.805 --> 18:21.183
It is. Uh, just Zengi.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.727
Just Zengi.

-Good!

18:32.861 --> 18:35.280
They liked the thesis,
and I was clear on the data.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.324
Just one problem--
I realized halfway through

18:37.407 --> 18:38.867
that these sweatpants

18:38.951 --> 18:40.160
are from a bachelorette party I went to,

18:40.244 --> 18:42.663
and they say WAP on the butt.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.332
I told them it stands for "We All Police."

18:45.415 --> 18:48.502
-Hey, wish me luck in there.
-Did your teeth get whiter?

18:48.585 --> 18:49.503
That's an illusion.

18:49.586 --> 18:51.004
My smile is so symmetrical,

18:51.088 --> 18:52.506
it makes my teeth seem brighter.

18:52.589 --> 18:54.758
Well, good luck. Oops.

-[clears throat] No.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.318
So right as we get there,

19:13.402 --> 19:16.280
Franzia disappears into these
crazy underground tunnels.

because I got to go.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.093
Hey, did Kevin seem weird
to you when we told him

19:38.177 --> 19:39.386
we were only there for that book?

19:39.469 --> 19:41.096
You think he didn't believe us?

19:41.180 --> 19:42.681
No, he seemed sad.

19:42.764 --> 19:44.349
I think he was disappointed

19:44.433 --> 19:45.934
that you were there
for the book and not for him.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.520
Maybe you should let him know
you've been missing him.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.315
Huh, well, it might be worth a shot.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.235
-What did you just do?
-I texted him a picture

19:55.319 --> 19:56.486
of my penis, like you suggested.

19:56.570 --> 19:57.988
No. Ugh!

19:58.071 --> 19:59.489
I meant for you to call him

19:59.573 --> 20:01.575
and tell him
you've been thinking about him.

20:01.658 --> 20:04.244
-Why didn't you say that?
-I thought it was understood.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.913
Hold on. He's writing back.

20:05.996 --> 20:08.498
-Well, what did he say?
-It's a link to a graph.

20:08.582 --> 20:11.001
It's a scatter plot

20:11.084 --> 20:13.670

20:13.754 --> 20:15.172

-I won.
-What?

Wait, you won? That's amazing.

Why aren't you dork-dancing?

20:31.855 --> 20:33.232

So I celebrated in the hallway
before I walked in.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.948
Fine. Mellow.

you would be bummed that you missed it.

Ugh, this sucks.

You didn't get to arrest Franzia.
