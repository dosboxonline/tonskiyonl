Am I free or is this a stay of execution?

All major law enforcement agencies have
been alerted. Nothing's come back.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.975
Good. Then we can start hunting him again.

05:10.101 --> 05:11.436
Elizabeth had a will.

05:12.603 --> 05:16.232
She designated me and Charlene
as Agnes' legal guardians.

I think she'd want us
to look forward, not back.

a dependency issue in the past.

You all right, son?

13:50.037 --> 13:51.664
You look like you've seen a ghost.

13:52.289 --> 13:53.541
[Ressler] Not a ghost. Just...

13:54.542 --> 13:55.918
someone I used to know.

14:01.715 --> 14:03.717

14:14.812 --> 14:16.689
[Theodore] Are you okay, mister?

14:16.772 --> 14:18.607
Oh, my God. What the hell are you doing?

14:18.691 --> 14:21.652
Um, I didn't wanna touch a dead person.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.612
Well, I'm not dead, so...

14:23.696 --> 14:25.155
Why are you sleeping in the hallway?

14:26.532 --> 14:27.491
Hey.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.660
You know your face is bleeding?

14:29.743 --> 14:32.162
My mom has a first-aid kit in the office.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.832
[groans] Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

14:34.915 --> 14:35.749
What?

14:36.250 --> 14:37.710
They robbed me.

14:37.793 --> 14:40.045
Who? Burglars? Pirates?

14:40.546 --> 14:41.672
That's so cool!

14:41.755 --> 14:43.674
You should call the cops, though.

14:43.757 --> 14:44.800
They can help.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.470
Trust me, wherever the pirates took
my stuff, it's not coming back.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.514
So it was pirates!

14:50.598 --> 14:52.808
I'm reading this book <i>Peter Pan,</i> and--

14:52.892 --> 14:54.393
I really gotta go, bud.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.353
Are you sure you're okay?

14:56.437 --> 14:58.063
I really think my mom can help you.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.481
I don't need your mom

14:59.565 --> 15:02.192
or a first-aid kit or a phone.
Look, I just--

15:02.276 --> 15:04.194
I need to be alone, understand?

15:06.113 --> 15:07.323
I said get out of here!

15:15.205 --> 15:17.583
-What do you think you're doing?
-Um...

15:18.667 --> 15:21.712
-Getting ice.
-You know what I'm talking about.

15:21.795 --> 15:23.714
My kid said he found you passed out.

15:23.797 --> 15:27.468
Well, since you're here,
I actually lost my key.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.937
Hey. Wasn't really planning
on entertaining but--

15:38.020 --> 15:41.982
Are you listening to anything I'm saying?
What you did was not okay.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.610
I don't want my son
seeing stuff like that.

15:44.693 --> 15:47.947
No offense, lady,
but this place isn't exactly the Ritz.

15:48.030 --> 15:52.368
You know, I'm sure he's seen plenty
of, uh, unsavory things.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.496
At least most people keep to themselves.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.041

You're a mess.

but I got robbed.

16:09.093 --> 16:12.137
I'd love to pay you,
but at the moment, I've got nothing.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.722
Sorry, really.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.642
But I can't let you stay if you can't pay.

16:18.185 --> 16:19.019
Okay.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.729
I get it. All right.

16:21.438 --> 16:22.982

[sighs] Look.

16:28.821 --> 16:32.866
Willy at Liberty Auto has been looking
for someone to help out around the garage.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.994
Garage? As in like a mechanic?

16:35.077 --> 16:36.787
More like a janitor.

16:37.454 --> 16:38.914
Unless that's beneath you.

16:39.581 --> 16:41.375
At this point, nothing's beneath me.

16:41.458 --> 16:42.751
Then I suggest you go see him.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.129
Okay, great, thanks, um...

16:45.879 --> 16:48.173
but do you know a doctor I could see?

16:49.091 --> 16:50.050
[sighs]

16:56.348 --> 16:58.809
-Shopping for someone special?
-I am.

16:58.892 --> 16:59.768
I'd love to help.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.479
We have a beautiful selection of roses
that just came in.

17:02.563 --> 17:03.522
Top of the line.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.524
I'm actually looking for carnations.

17:05.607 --> 17:08.444
Oh. Honey, I think we can do better.

17:08.527 --> 17:11.739
If you ask me, carnations are
the sad flower of weddings past.

17:11.822 --> 17:14.241
Well, sad or not, they're her favorite.

17:14.324 --> 17:16.452
She always said
people underestimate their beauty.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.453
Okay.

17:17.536 --> 17:18.579
Understood.

17:18.662 --> 17:19.955
Have a color in mind?

17:20.039 --> 17:22.916
The pink and the red are both so lovely.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.585
She likes the purple.

17:24.668 --> 17:28.172
Ah. Is she impulsive? Unpredictable?

17:28.255 --> 17:30.883
If it's all the same to you,
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

17:30.966 --> 17:33.218
Of course. This will just be a minute.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.560
She's impulsive and unpredictable.

17:42.061 --> 17:45.522
I'm the opposite. I've been thinking about
what I'm about to do for two years.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.901
What am I gonna wear? What should I say?

17:49.902 --> 17:52.613
Didn't mean to be short with you.
I'm just a little nervous.

17:52.696 --> 17:55.908
It sounds like she is
about the luckiest woman alive.

17:55.991 --> 17:59.787
To have someone give so much thought
and attention to a moment like this.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.205
You.

18:01.288 --> 18:02.581
You really see her,

18:02.664 --> 18:06.001
and if she has no more sense
than a titmouse, she's gonna say yes.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.170
Oh, this isn't-- I'm not gonna--

18:08.253 --> 18:09.588
-Uh--
-Is she expecting it?

18:09.671 --> 18:10.631
I hope not.

18:10.714 --> 18:13.133
A proposal's so much better
when it's a surprise.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.969
Oh. After everything that's happened
the past two years,

18:16.053 --> 18:18.806
me just showing up
is gonna be a huge surprise.

18:19.473 --> 18:22.476
[doctor] Looks like we're dealing
with a couple of broken ribs

18:22.559 --> 18:24.144
and a lacerated kidney.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.897
Folks in this town
know how to roll out the red carpet.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.857
Then beat you over the head with it.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.944
How much pain are you in?

18:32.027 --> 18:34.154
I may look like that green smiley face,

18:34.238 --> 18:37.199
but I feel like the red devil
bawling his eyes out.

18:38.867 --> 18:41.120
A while back, I got in a car accident.

18:41.870 --> 18:45.374
Doc offered to prescribe me oxycodone,
but I turned him down.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.959
Didn't wanna risk getting hooked.

18:47.626 --> 18:50.254
So I gutted out the pain
on Tylenol and rest.

18:50.337 --> 18:51.463
Nearly killed me.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.632
I'm not sure I could do that again.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.634
And I don't think you should.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.262
Oxycodone is a powerful narcotic.

18:58.345 --> 19:01.557
You have to be very careful
not to overuse or abuse it.

19:02.432 --> 19:05.644
But you seem to be more concerned
about that than most,

19:05.727 --> 19:08.647
so I'm comfortable writing you
a prescription.

19:09.565 --> 19:13.569
Janie will give you four pills to tide
you over till you can get to a pharmacy.

19:14.069 --> 19:15.154
I appreciate that.

19:26.373 --> 19:27.416

storage facility,

19:35.090 --> 19:38.427

the garage floor.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.888
My wife wants me
to spruce the place up a bit.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.891
And what Helen wants, Helen gets.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.310
Which is where you come in.

19:46.393 --> 19:50.189
I need someone to do
basically all the crap I don't wanna do.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.523
Sweeping, mopping,

19:51.607 --> 19:52.733
toilets, dusting,

19:52.816 --> 19:54.860
unloading boxes, inventory.

19:54.943 --> 19:56.820
Is that a '72 Chevy Nova?

19:57.321 --> 19:58.655
That thing's a beauty.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.866
Do not bring Layla into this.

20:00.949 --> 20:03.452
-Oh, she's got a name, huh?
-She sure does.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.703
Pain in my ass, though.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.289
She's got potential.

20:08.290 --> 20:11.418
And it doesn't need to be rebuilt,
suspension's solid.

20:11.501 --> 20:13.420
Everything else is surface rust.

20:13.503 --> 20:16.423

-Didn't have much of a choice.

20:16.924 --> 20:20.010
I grew up watching my dad restore
anything he could get his hands on.

20:20.093 --> 20:23.055
Spent my childhood scouring
the Detroit junkyards with him.

20:23.138 --> 20:25.891
A Detroit boy, that explains it.

20:26.391 --> 20:28.560
Would be sacrilegious
not to know your stuff.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.480
Well, to be honest,
I wasn't looking for a job.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.233
But I got robbed, I owe money on my room,

20:34.316 --> 20:36.860
and it's not like
I got anywhere else to be.

20:36.944 --> 20:39.863
Plus, I love cars. I know how to fix them.

20:39.947 --> 20:43.492
And at one time, I was told
I was a pretty responsible guy.

20:43.575 --> 20:44.576
Fair enough.

20:46.536 --> 20:50.874
Tell you what, you help me with Layla,
in addition to the other work,

20:50.958 --> 20:52.668
and I'll pay you up front.

20:53.293 --> 20:57.214
Been trying to restore her for months,
and she's stubborn as hell.

20:57.965 --> 20:58.924
What do you say?

20:59.841 --> 21:01.093
Sounds like a plan.

21:05.180 --> 21:08.100
Hey. That should cover me till Wednesday.

21:08.183 --> 21:10.143
So it all worked out?

21:10.227 --> 21:11.436
Sure did.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.773
In fact, I got a promotion.
I'm working on the cars now.

21:14.856 --> 21:17.901
Thank you. If there was something
I could do to pay you back--

21:17.985 --> 21:19.403
Theo, get up.

21:20.028 --> 21:21.321
Theo, now!

21:21.405 --> 21:23.615

-It's him.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.744
You wanna pay me back?
Don't let him find us.

The problem is that I can't find them.

Oh, um...

22:01.194 --> 22:03.405
I mean, why are you looking for them?

What'd they do?

22:05.407 --> 22:09.036

22:39.483 --> 22:41.234
Please, don't ask.

Tell me who you are
and why the police are looking for you.

22:51.495 --> 22:53.038
[Lauren] I don't wanna talk about this.

22:53.121 --> 22:56.541
Normally, I wouldn't insist,
but I lied to a police officer for you.

22:56.625 --> 22:59.044
I'm not a criminal,
if that's what you're worried about.

22:59.127 --> 23:01.338
You acted like one.
Why was he looking for you?

23:01.421 --> 23:04.758
-He's my husband.
-Why are you running from him?

23:08.970 --> 23:11.556
This is from when he threw me
into our glass coffee table.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.521
It shattered,
and I ended up with 40 stitches.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.231
Oh, and...

23:21.066 --> 23:22.234
This was a fun one.

23:22.859 --> 23:24.778
One morning, we got into a fight

23:24.861 --> 23:27.239
because I stayed out later than expected

23:27.322 --> 23:29.074
with a girlfriend at dinner.

23:29.616 --> 23:31.952
He threw coffee at me,
and it splashed all over my foot,

23:32.035 --> 23:33.870
giving me third-degree burns.

23:34.496 --> 23:35.956
That's unforgivable.

23:36.039 --> 23:38.750
And yet I always forgave him.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.712
He'd apologize after, bring me flowers.

23:43.338 --> 23:45.715
I always thought
the next time would be different,

23:45.799 --> 23:47.717
that I could help him be better.

23:49.344 --> 23:52.597
If he'd stayed away from Theodore,
I would've stayed.

23:53.431 --> 23:55.600
But once, after a bad day at work,

23:55.684 --> 23:58.186
he came home
and wanted it quiet at dinner.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.730
Theodore was chatty.

24:12.325 --> 24:14.286
Backhanded him across the face.

24:15.328 --> 24:18.081
He didn't even cry. He was so shocked.

24:23.253 --> 24:25.714
We left the next morning
and never looked back.

24:25.797 --> 24:28.925
You didn't go to the police
because he was the police.

Shane's a powerful man where we're from.

I couldn't run from my problems,

as you say he is, he'll be back.

[melancholy music playing]

39:10.139 --> 39:12.475
[voice breaking]
I know there are good people out there.

39:12.558 --> 39:15.644
People I could connect with.
People I should connect with.

39:16.395 --> 39:17.688
But I don't.

39:18.230 --> 39:19.231
I can't.

39:23.402 --> 39:24.612
Not yet, anyway.

39:27.406 --> 39:28.491
Theodore?

39:32.578 --> 39:33.537
You were right.

39:34.413 --> 39:35.915
He was a bad guy.

39:35.998 --> 39:38.626
No, I wasn't.

39:42.755 --> 39:43.923
You were right.

39:44.715 --> 39:47.093
You saw the good in him when I couldn't.

39:47.593 --> 39:49.261
And he saved us.

39:50.012 --> 39:52.515
If he's so good, then why'd he walk away?

39:53.557 --> 39:56.602
I know it might be hard
for you to understand...

39:57.937 --> 39:59.688
but he's in a lot of pain.

40:01.565 --> 40:04.443
-Do you think he'll ever come back?
-Honestly?

40:05.778 --> 40:07.238
I don't know.

40:09.824 --> 40:10.991
[Lauren sighs]

[poignant music playing]

40:35.349 --> 40:37.351
I'm glad you're here with Tom.

40:37.435 --> 40:40.479
I used to hate you, no offense,

40:40.563 --> 40:42.606
but there's no point in denying it.

40:42.690 --> 40:43.649
Still...

40:45.943 --> 40:47.570
I'm happy you're not alone.

40:48.279 --> 40:51.240
<i>You know, I told Harold</i>
<i>I was coming tonight,</i>

40:51.323 --> 40:55.327
and he said that Agnes wants today
to be a celebration of your life,

40:55.411 --> 40:56.704
not a memory of your death.

40:56.787 --> 40:58.914
Smart kid you two made.

40:58.998 --> 41:01.375
<i>She's strong and wise.</i>

41:02.960 --> 41:06.505
She's dealing in a way
I still haven't figured out yet.

41:07.923 --> 41:10.926
<i>For now, I'm stuck in the place</i>
<i>between sleep and awake...</i>

41:12.261 --> 41:14.597
<i>the place where you can</i>
<i>still remember dreaming.</i>

41:16.307 --> 41:18.267
Maybe we can meet there sometime.

41:18.976 --> 41:20.603
Go on adventures together.

41:21.979 --> 41:23.230
Climb mountains.

41:23.939 --> 41:25.441
Explore galaxies.

41:29.862 --> 41:30.905
I'd like that.

41:35.659 --> 41:37.661
More than you could possibly know.
