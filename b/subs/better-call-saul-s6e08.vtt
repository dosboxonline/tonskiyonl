43:44.581 --> 43:49.085
Now, Ms. Wexler tells me

43:44.581 --> 43:49.085
she has court at 10:00.

43:49.085 --> 43:50.587
What's on your docket?

43:52.964 --> 43:54.924
Hey. Listen.

43:54.924 --> 43:57.135
Where do you need to be?

43:57.135 --> 44:00.679
Uh... Office. My office.

44:00.679 --> 44:03.891
Clients start showing up

44:00.679 --> 44:03.891
around 9:30.

44:03.891 --> 44:05.393
Oh, my car's gone.

44:05.393 --> 44:06.852
No, it's on the way home.

44:06.852 --> 44:09.063
You'll have it

44:06.852 --> 44:09.063
when you need it.

44:09.063 --> 44:11.899
So you two are gonna

44:09.063 --> 44:11.899
go about your day.

44:11.899 --> 44:14.569
Normal. Same as ever.

44:14.569 --> 44:18.364
Today, you're Meryl Streep

44:14.569 --> 44:18.364
and Laurence Olivier.

44:18.364 --> 44:20.116
No staring into space.

44:20.116 --> 44:23.035
Nothing out of the ordinary.

44:20.116 --> 44:23.035
You cover.

44:23.035 --> 44:24.621
If anybody talks to you,

44:24.621 --> 44:28.166
it's just another day

44:24.621 --> 44:28.166
that ends in Y, that's all.

44:28.166 --> 44:29.875
When you get home,

44:28.166 --> 44:29.875
we'll be gone

44:29.875 --> 44:33.254
and everything will be back

44:29.875 --> 44:33.254
the way it was.

44:33.254 --> 44:34.339
Now...

44:35.340 --> 44:38.676
I need to impress upon you:

44:38.676 --> 44:40.761
none of this ever happened.

44:41.887 --> 44:42.930
None of it.

44:44.223 --> 44:45.433
Understand?

44:46.809 --> 44:49.061
Say it out loud.

44:46.809 --> 44:49.061
I need to hear it.

44:49.061 --> 44:50.396
We understand.

44:52.273 --> 44:53.525
It never happened.

44:55.026 --> 44:59.113
I'm gonna go out there

44:55.026 --> 44:59.113
and you're gonna get ready.

44:59.113 --> 45:00.323
Before I shut that door,

45:00.323 --> 45:01.574
is there anything you need

45:01.574 --> 45:03.201
from the other room?

45:01.574 --> 45:03.201
Toiletries?

45:03.201 --> 45:05.620
Clothes?

45:03.201 --> 45:05.620
Anything to start your day?

45:05.620 --> 45:07.163
No.

45:07.163 --> 45:08.247
We're set.

46:33.416 --> 46:34.459
Hold it.

47:14.582 --> 47:15.667
Go ahead.

47:20.254 --> 47:21.464
Easy.
