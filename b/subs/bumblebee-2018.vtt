WEBVTT

00:54.560 --> 00:56.279
They've broken through the front lines!

00:56.360 --> 00:57.794
I've lost contact with the capital!

00:57.880 --> 00:59.314
There's too many of them!

01:01.520 --> 01:02.590
Stand fast!

01:05.960 --> 01:06.996
Finish them!

01:18.360 --> 01:20.192
Where's b-127?

01:34.120 --> 01:35.680
Sorry I'm late. I hit a little traffic.

01:35.880 --> 01:37.758
Get down! Incoming!

01:37.840 --> 01:38.840
Optimus.

01:40.960 --> 01:44.556
Decepticons, attack!

01:45.160 --> 01:48.915
Autobots, fall back! Get to the tower!

01:49.960 --> 01:53.840
Destroy the launch pad!
Let none escape!

01:59.880 --> 02:03.635
Cybertron has fallen.
Get to the escape pods.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.714
There are other autobots
scattered across the galaxy.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.270
We must reach them if we hope to survive.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.795
Optimus, this is our home.
We have to fight for it.

02:17.840 --> 02:21.436
We will fight on.
But we must find refuge first.

02:21.760 --> 02:25.117
I found a planet
that's well hidden. Earth.

02:25.360 --> 02:28.034
You will travel there
and establish a base for us.

02:28.280 --> 02:30.670
Once we've gathered the others,
we'll join you.

02:31.040 --> 02:32.679
You must protect the planet.

02:33.040 --> 02:37.512
If the Decepticons find it,
then our people are truly finished.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.075
Now go!

02:54.640 --> 02:57.792
Good luck, soldier.
I'll buy you some time.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.160
No!

04:03.520 --> 04:06.354
Okay, okay!
I'm dead already, man!

04:08.360 --> 04:09.874
Not just you.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.336
Being the overachiever that you are,

04:11.360 --> 04:13.320
you managed to get
your whole squad killed, Danny.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.480
Bravo.

04:14.560 --> 04:17.120
- Come on, man. Those things sting.
- What things? These things?

04:17.800 --> 04:19.760
You know, I wouldn't know.
I haven't been hit yet.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.350
Okay, you know what?
That's too close, man.

04:22.440 --> 04:23.760
You could've taken out an eye.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.797
I got a date tonight, man.
This ain't sexy!

04:26.040 --> 04:27.633
You're right. I'm sorry.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.675
That one was on me.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.558
That's a malfunctioning trigger.

04:31.720 --> 04:34.554
This weapon is just faulty.
Someone is going to get a talking to...

04:34.640 --> 04:35.676
Man, would you stop?

04:35.840 --> 04:37.638
All right, just stop.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.913
I should've let you die in Grenada.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.936
If you did, we wouldn't be able
to come to the forest,

04:42.960 --> 04:44.560
run around and play these awesome games.

04:44.760 --> 04:45.910
Exactly.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.834
I hate you.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.152
Wow, man, that hurts. 'Cause I love you.

04:52.320 --> 04:54.994
But you refuse to let it in
'cause you got intimacy issues.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.896
A therapist will probably tell you
you weren't hugged enough as a kid.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.515
- Look, man.
- Danny, I know I look stupid, but...

05:00.960 --> 05:02.553
Hey, yo, take cover!

05:15.520 --> 05:16.840
Danny.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.680
You okay?

05:18.960 --> 05:20.440
Yeah, man.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.914
This is agent Jack burns.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.038
I need medical up here now.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.315
We have a projectile strike

05:28.400 --> 05:30.240
in the northwest corner
of the training course.

05:30.480 --> 05:31.994
Multiple injuries.

05:32.600 --> 05:37.072
And would someone please explain to me
why you dropped napalm on your own guys!

05:37.440 --> 05:40.433
<i>Negative. There are no live fire drills
in the northwest sector.</i>

05:40.760 --> 05:42.513
What the hell hit us, then?

05:55.560 --> 05:56.880
Target on your right!

06:11.920 --> 06:16.073
I need all of you to fan out
and track that thing down now!

06:19.240 --> 06:20.240
Drive!

06:26.920 --> 06:27.920
There!

06:31.440 --> 06:32.440
What the hell?

06:32.760 --> 06:33.876
Take it down!

06:38.360 --> 06:40.431
Get down there now
and flush that thing out!

06:41.600 --> 06:42.600
There it is!

06:51.680 --> 06:53.512
<i>Target has been located, sir.</i>

06:55.120 --> 06:56.120
Light it up!

07:06.920 --> 07:07.920
Damn it!

07:19.080 --> 07:20.275
Oh, no.

07:31.720 --> 07:33.837
It's going for the mine! Cut it off!

07:50.160 --> 07:51.879
Move, move!

08:04.720 --> 08:05.720
Please.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.393
This is a mistake.

08:09.160 --> 08:10.913
Stay cool. Hold your fire.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.992
I don't want to hurt anyone.

08:20.760 --> 08:21.910
Who called in the air force?

08:26.200 --> 08:27.953
That's not the air force.

08:33.520 --> 08:34.520
Run.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.759
Did you think you could hide?

09:09.560 --> 09:11.472
Now you'll die screaming.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.080
Like your friends!

09:49.120 --> 09:51.476
Tell me where your friends are hiding.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.200
I'll never talk.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.039
Is that right?

09:57.120 --> 09:58.759
Then let's make it official.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.714
B-127...

10:30.640 --> 10:32.950
As a member
of the autobot resistance,

10:33.320 --> 10:35.391
you are a traitor to cybertron

10:35.640 --> 10:37.791
and are hereby sentenced

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
to death.

10:46.040 --> 10:47.040
No!

10:47.920 --> 10:49.115
No!

12:24.160 --> 12:25.514
Shut up.

12:34.600 --> 12:38.640
<i>Sweetness, sweetness
I was onlyjoking</i>

12:38.720 --> 12:42.509
<i>when I said by rights
you should be</i>

12:42.600 --> 12:44.512
<i>bludgeoned in your bed</i>

12:47.400 --> 12:50.154
<i>and now I know
how Joan of arc felt</i>

12:50.240 --> 12:54.200
<i>now I know how Joan of arc felt</i>

12:55.400 --> 12:56.629
morning, dad.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.473
<i>As the flames Rose
to her Roman nose</i>

12:58.560 --> 13:01.598
<i>and her walkman started to melt</i>

13:27.080 --> 13:29.993
<i>Bigmouth, la-da-da da-da</i>

13:30.600 --> 13:32.876
<i>bigmouth, la-da-da da-da</i>

13:33.600 --> 13:35.080
<i>bigmouth...</i>

13:35.680 --> 13:37.990
No! Don't tickle.

13:44.320 --> 13:45.320
Caught.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.314
Gross, Ron.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.156
Excuse me.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.351
Are those your diving trophies?

13:53.560 --> 13:55.199
Taking up too much space in my room.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.033
You're gonna regret doing that.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.440
Where's breakfast?

13:59.520 --> 14:03.196
Breakfast is conveniently located
in the cupboards and the fridge.

14:03.800 --> 14:04.836
Try to help out...

14:04.920 --> 14:05.956
- Yeah.
- A little.

14:06.240 --> 14:09.551
Since I'm such a big kid now,
making my own breakfast and what have you,

14:09.800 --> 14:13.157
you know how I could be
an even bigger help around here, mom?

14:13.480 --> 14:14.630
If I had a car.

14:14.880 --> 14:15.880
Charlie.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.720
What do you know,
it's my birthday tomorrow,

14:17.800 --> 14:19.996
perfect timing for a large cash gift.

14:20.320 --> 14:22.755
You know, $500 is really all I need
to finish the corvette.

14:22.880 --> 14:26.191
I don't have $500.
You know how much nurses make.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.516
"Half as much as doctors
for twice the work," right?

14:29.600 --> 14:30.920
Tell you what, kiddo...

14:31.000 --> 14:32.480
I got another job interview tomorrow.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.796
If all goes well,
I'll have you swimming in car parts.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.519
I prefer cash, Ron.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.557
Don't be rude. Feed the dog.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.836
Conan is Otis's dog. Make him do it.

14:40.920 --> 14:41.920
What?

14:43.040 --> 14:45.953
You look so grown up in your karate suit.

14:46.040 --> 14:48.760
My baby boy is becoming a man.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.274
Shoot, I'm gonna be late.

14:51.520 --> 14:54.718
Can you drop your brother at karate
on your way to work, please?

14:55.280 --> 14:57.078
I could if I had a car.

14:57.160 --> 15:00.437
Just let him follow you on your bike
so nobody abducts him.

15:00.680 --> 15:03.752
Abducts him?
You just said he's a grown man now.

15:03.880 --> 15:07.191
If anyone tries anything,
I will rupture their freaking spleen.

15:23.040 --> 15:27.080
<i>And do you feel scared? I do</i>

15:27.400 --> 15:30.677
<i>but I won't stop and falter</i>

15:32.080 --> 15:35.039
<i>and if we threw it all away</i>

15:36.480 --> 15:39.279
<i>things can only get better...</i>

15:40.960 --> 15:42.758
- That's two for you guys.
- Thanks, bro.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.957
All right. Have a good one.

15:45.160 --> 15:46.355
Eat safe.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.952
Excuse me. Hi. We've never actually met...

15:56.040 --> 15:57.360
Sorry, I can't right now.

15:57.440 --> 15:59.352
Yeah. Oh, okay.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.150
Hey, hot dog girl!

16:02.760 --> 16:03.760
Oh, my god!

16:04.760 --> 16:07.594
I'm so sorry. Oh, god.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.909
Someone's getting fired.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.072
If I had to wear that,
I would pray to be fired.

16:14.320 --> 16:15.320
Good one, Tina.

16:19.360 --> 16:20.360
Let's go.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.314
<i>On the street where you live</i>

16:34.400 --> 16:36.357
<i>girls talk about their social lives</i>

16:38.320 --> 16:40.789
<i>they're made of lipstick
plastic and paint</i>

16:41.080 --> 16:43.470
<i>a touch of sable in their eyes</i>

16:45.000 --> 16:47.276
<i>all your life all you asked</i>

16:47.400 --> 16:49.676
<i>when is your daddy
gonna talk to you</i>

16:51.360 --> 16:53.477
<i>but we're living
in another world</i>

16:53.560 --> 16:55.631
<i>tryin' to get
your message through...</i>

16:58.440 --> 16:59.635
Come on.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.116
Hey, uncle Hank.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.510
Are you still working on that damn car?

17:03.840 --> 17:05.593
You still working
on that damn personality?

17:07.440 --> 17:09.671
- What have you got for me?
- Whatever you want.

17:09.880 --> 17:12.440
Russians are gonna
blow us all to hell anyway.

17:12.520 --> 17:13.920
That's the spirit.

17:14.440 --> 17:15.669
Hey, kid.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.960
Hand me the three-eighths, would you?

17:18.000 --> 17:19.912
You working on the carburetor?

17:23.760 --> 17:26.594
- You need the half-inch.
- I said the three...

17:30.120 --> 17:31.873
- Thanks, kid.
- Yep.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.839
<i>You saw me standing</i>

17:43.920 --> 17:48.472
<i>by the wall corner
of a main street</i>

17:49.920 --> 17:51.354
<i>take a chance</i>

17:51.440 --> 17:56.640
<i>like all dreamers
can't find another way</i>

17:57.760 --> 18:01.356
<i>you don't have to dream it all</i>

18:01.440 --> 18:03.318
<i>just live a day...</i>

18:07.200 --> 18:09.795
<i>Don't save a prayer for me now</i>

19:25.680 --> 19:30.596
Where is optimus prime?
He survived the fall of cybertron.

19:30.680 --> 19:34.469
And no rebellion is truly dead
until the leader is vanquished.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.190
So where is he?

19:37.560 --> 19:41.236
My name is cliffjumper,
lieutenant in the autobot resistance.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.552
My safe return will be considered...

19:43.880 --> 19:45.633
Wrong answer.

19:46.400 --> 19:49.074
We know he's planning to establish a base.

19:49.160 --> 19:51.959
Tell us where it is
and we'll let you live.

19:52.040 --> 19:54.680
My name is cliffjumper, lieutenant...

19:56.320 --> 19:58.835
<i>Sometimes you want to go...</i>

19:59.440 --> 20:00.556
No.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.191
That's b-127's signal.

20:03.280 --> 20:06.034
- Can you trace it?
- Already did.

20:06.880 --> 20:11.238
If you won't tell us where prime is,
perhaps your young friend will.

20:11.400 --> 20:12.595
Never.

20:12.680 --> 20:16.515
You're a brave warrior.
You deserve a better death.

20:17.640 --> 20:18.994
But then again...

20:24.920 --> 20:27.276
Set course for earth.

20:39.480 --> 20:41.120
I'll give you thirty bucks for all of it.

20:41.880 --> 20:44.076
I can get twice that much
for the coil alone.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.152
From who?
I'm the only one that comes in here.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.879
I don't even know how you're still open.

20:47.960 --> 20:50.236
Just take it. Go. My show is on.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.439
Hey, where did you get that beetle?

20:54.720 --> 20:58.191
I swear to god, ever since
they put up that dumb-ass tower,

20:58.280 --> 21:00.795
I can't get a signal to watch my shows.

21:00.880 --> 21:02.837
I've got to see what happens
to alf this week.

21:14.120 --> 21:15.474
Come on!

21:30.000 --> 21:31.400
Are you kidding me?

21:36.280 --> 21:37.634
Damn it.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.754
I give up.

21:46.560 --> 21:48.870
I can't do this without you.

21:50.440 --> 21:53.353
<i>Nice to meet you.
Interested in a new buick?</i>

21:54.200 --> 21:57.034
<i>- Nice try.
- All right, I touched. But I didn't eat.</i>

21:57.520 --> 21:59.477
<i>And I'm supposed to believe
one of these steaks</i>

21:59.560 --> 22:01.517
<i>just got up and walked away on its own?</i>

22:01.600 --> 22:03.512
<i>I've seen stranger.</i>

22:04.120 --> 22:05.600
<i>No dinner for you tonight.</i>

22:05.720 --> 22:09.794
<i>But I'm starved!
I've been fasting since lunch!</i>

22:11.120 --> 22:13.430
<i>Well, I did eat that pumpkin.</i>

22:33.840 --> 22:35.354
Happy birthday.

22:48.440 --> 22:49.874
I miss you, dad.

22:51.440 --> 22:53.113
I think it's too low, honey.

22:53.280 --> 22:56.398
No. No, I think it goes to that button.

22:56.520 --> 23:00.116
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I don't know about... fix it.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.280
Hey.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.710
- Good morning, birthday girl!
- Hi.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.200
You look...

23:07.160 --> 23:08.160
Nice.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.640
Happy birthday, baby.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.759
I love you. Come on, open your present.
I'm gonna be late for work.

23:15.520 --> 23:16.840
Thanks, mom.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.073
Helmet. With...

23:23.720 --> 23:24.720
Daffodils.

23:24.920 --> 23:26.639
So, I keep hearing

23:26.840 --> 23:30.629
about people on mopeds getting
run over and their brains smashed in.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.399
You got to wear this from now on.

23:32.560 --> 23:35.314
I don't care if it's not the law.
It's our law.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.352
Plus, look how cute it is.

23:39.800 --> 23:40.800
Yeah.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.439
Happy birthday.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.440
I actually got you
a little gift, too, Charlie.

23:44.960 --> 23:47.794
I mean, it's small,
but, it's from the heart.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.312
A smile is a powerful thing.

23:57.560 --> 23:58.880
It releases endorphins.

23:59.240 --> 24:02.233
It says to the world,
"I'm fun and approachable."

24:04.520 --> 24:08.673
You know, there's a whole chapter in here
about how people who smile more often

24:08.800 --> 24:10.280
actually have more friends.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.270
That's unbelievable.

24:12.760 --> 24:14.656
I really think
it's gonna change your whole outlook

24:14.680 --> 24:15.796
if you smile more often.

24:33.320 --> 24:34.640
I want the beetle.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.837
- What?
- The yellow beetle, I want it.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.296
I'll make you a deal.
If I get that thing started, it's mine.

24:40.320 --> 24:43.154
That's no deal.
That's just you taking my car.

24:43.240 --> 24:46.995
If I get it started, I keep it
and I work here every day for a year.

24:47.240 --> 24:49.311
I'll scrub the grease
off the floors, okay?

24:49.400 --> 24:52.279
I will pick up and organize
every scrap of paper in this place.

24:52.520 --> 24:55.957
I'll even detail your horrible,
disgusting toilets.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.157
Please. It's my birthday.

25:00.960 --> 25:02.280
Sorry, no deal.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.319
'Cause we ain't hiring.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.990
It's yours, kid. Happy birthday.

25:12.120 --> 25:13.120
Thank you.

25:15.360 --> 25:17.192
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

25:17.520 --> 25:19.432
And my toilets are gorgeous.

25:31.520 --> 25:36.436
<i>Think about it
there must be higher love</i>

25:36.520 --> 25:41.276
<i>down in the heart or hidden
in the stars above</i>

25:41.360 --> 25:46.116
<i>without it
life is a wasted time...</i>

25:49.200 --> 25:50.953
Oh, god, please.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.314
Come on.

25:59.640 --> 26:00.710
Oh, my...

26:00.800 --> 26:02.314
Oh, my god!

26:03.080 --> 26:05.675
Oh, my god, thank you so much!
I love you!

26:12.320 --> 26:15.677
- That thing ain't even safe to drive.
- It's a deathtrap.

26:19.800 --> 26:21.200
She's happy, though.

26:23.120 --> 26:25.635
<i>Bring me a higher love</i>

26:27.920 --> 26:30.037
<i>bring me a higher love</i>

26:32.520 --> 26:35.194
<i>bring me a higher love</i>

26:36.840 --> 26:42.393
<i>where's that higher love
I keep thinking of?</i>

26:42.760 --> 26:43.830
Man.

26:44.440 --> 26:45.794
Looks amazing.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.400
What?

27:56.120 --> 27:57.440
Oh, my god.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.035
Charlie, what was that noise?

28:23.120 --> 28:25.456
Nothing! I'm fine. Mom, you should
go back to bed. Everything's fine.

28:25.480 --> 28:28.314
- What the hell is that?
- It's...

28:28.400 --> 28:31.279
What is that car doing in our garage?

28:31.360 --> 28:32.510
Car?

28:34.520 --> 28:36.193
That car

28:37.440 --> 28:38.760
is my car.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.634
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

28:41.080 --> 28:42.992
It runs. Yeah.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.440
Those aren't safe.

28:44.880 --> 28:47.236
I wish you would've told me
before you brought it home.

28:47.320 --> 28:48.959
Okay. Sorry.

28:50.160 --> 28:54.040
- I'm in the middle of some stuff, mom.
- Okay, I'll get out of your hair, but...

28:54.560 --> 28:57.280
Tell me things sometime.

28:57.360 --> 28:58.874
- I'm your mother.
- Okay.

28:59.280 --> 29:00.555
Okay.

29:00.960 --> 29:01.960
Good night.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.919
- It really runs?
- Yeah, it really runs.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
Cool.

29:17.160 --> 29:18.674
You still in there?

29:22.440 --> 29:23.590
Okay.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.672
A little jumpy. I'm sorry.

29:36.200 --> 29:37.200
Okay.

30:02.800 --> 30:03.800
Hi.

30:16.720 --> 30:18.359
Oh, god, are you...

30:21.240 --> 30:22.720
Do you speak?

30:35.320 --> 30:36.674
I won't hurt you.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.317
Can you understand me?

31:09.720 --> 31:11.154
What are you?

31:12.960 --> 31:14.553
Where did you come from?

31:15.800 --> 31:17.314
Okay. It's okay.

31:26.520 --> 31:27.874
You like my shirt?

31:28.760 --> 31:30.035
You a metal fan?

31:30.840 --> 31:31.910
No, wait...

31:32.840 --> 31:34.513
Oh, who? Me?

31:35.600 --> 31:36.795
Who am I?

31:38.680 --> 31:39.796
I'm...

31:41.120 --> 31:42.440
Charlie.

31:43.600 --> 31:44.954
Charlie Watson.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.952
I'm 18.

31:47.600 --> 31:48.875
Today.

31:49.200 --> 31:51.157
Actually, it's my birthday today.

31:53.280 --> 31:54.430
What's your name?

31:57.960 --> 32:00.270
You don't know
or you don't have a name?

32:05.280 --> 32:07.351
You sound like a little Bumblebee.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.392
I'm gonna call you that from now on.

32:15.320 --> 32:16.436
Bumblebee.

32:18.480 --> 32:20.039
Matches your outfit, too.

32:46.680 --> 32:48.160
I want a divorce, Roy!

32:48.360 --> 32:50.477
Come on, Amber.
Give me one good reason.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.392
You tried to sleep with my sister!

32:52.480 --> 32:53.880
Unsuccessfully!

32:53.960 --> 32:56.395
Yeah, you're unsuccessful at everything.

32:56.560 --> 32:59.075
That down payment was for a house.
You bought a car.

32:59.160 --> 33:02.631
How stupid are you, Roy?
We don't need a car. God!

33:02.800 --> 33:06.077
Now, just settle down for one second
and hear me out.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.715
- What the hell is that?
- What?

33:13.880 --> 33:16.679
Oh, god, Roy,
that thing is coming right for us!

33:16.760 --> 33:18.399
No, no, no, no, no...

33:18.480 --> 33:20.392
Not my car. Not my car.

33:20.480 --> 33:22.676
Please, god, no, not my car!

33:33.640 --> 33:35.632
Oh, thank god, my car.

33:36.400 --> 33:37.720
Yeah, I'm okay.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.999
That's good, baby. That's good.

33:42.160 --> 33:43.753
Run. Run!

33:59.280 --> 34:00.509
God!

34:03.200 --> 34:04.554
Is that my car?

34:07.520 --> 34:08.590
Hello...

34:23.080 --> 34:24.116
Jeez!

34:24.199 --> 34:25.520
Earth.

34:25.600 --> 34:26.670
Roy!

34:27.520 --> 34:29.193
How underwhelming.

34:29.280 --> 34:32.431
The indigenous life is even more primitive
than I expected.

34:34.199 --> 34:35.199
Hey...

34:39.120 --> 34:40.793
I like the way they pop.

34:40.880 --> 34:42.234
Focus, comrade.

34:42.639 --> 34:47.556
B-127's distress signal came
from the western coast of this continent.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.554
For now, we head west.

35:04.920 --> 35:07.116
When do they start
letting you use nunchucks?

35:07.200 --> 35:08.680
I don't know, but I hope soon.

35:08.760 --> 35:11.275
- Morning! See you guys later.
- Where you off to so fast?

35:12.360 --> 35:14.352
Nowhere. Have a nice day.

35:16.560 --> 35:17.880
Morning...

35:20.320 --> 35:21.436
Bee?

35:24.280 --> 35:25.794
Bee, where are you?

35:28.880 --> 35:30.997
Oh, god. Oh, god.
Oh, god. Oh, god.

35:31.080 --> 35:32.080
Bee!

35:32.160 --> 35:33.753
Where did you go?

35:39.520 --> 35:40.520
Otis!

35:41.680 --> 35:43.194
Have you seen my car?

35:43.280 --> 35:44.430
Unfortunately, yes.

35:44.520 --> 35:48.673
No, have you seen my car today?
It was in the garage. Someone stole it!

35:48.760 --> 35:50.513
No, idiot. Mom took it.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.114
She had to bring conan to the vet

35:52.200 --> 35:54.056
because he swallowed, like,
a rubber glove or something

35:54.080 --> 35:55.719
and Ron needed the station wagon.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.195
Thank god.

35:59.880 --> 36:01.030
Wait.

36:06.800 --> 36:08.792
Hi. Excuse me. It's me again.

36:08.960 --> 36:11.016
- We never officially met, but...
- I can't right now. Sorry.

36:11.040 --> 36:12.269
Nope. Yep.

36:12.640 --> 36:13.915
Okay.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.632
I know, buddy. Hang in there.

36:22.240 --> 36:24.152
You can't eat everything you see.

36:24.480 --> 36:27.393
Just let this be
a good life lesson for you.

36:29.480 --> 36:32.234
Oh, my god. Stop it! Don't do that!

36:36.840 --> 36:37.840
Bee, no!

36:43.520 --> 36:44.520
Mom?

36:45.640 --> 36:47.916
Jesus! Charlie, what are you doing?

36:48.000 --> 36:49.320
Mom, you gotta pull over.

36:49.400 --> 36:52.279
- What the hell is going on?
- Just pull the car over.

36:52.360 --> 36:55.034
Okay, okay. All right.

36:57.680 --> 37:01.674
Would you put that robot junk away?
What are you thinking?

37:01.960 --> 37:04.759
You almost gave me a heart attack.
I thought I was being carjacked.

37:04.840 --> 37:06.593
I'm taking the dog to the vet.

37:06.680 --> 37:10.594
I can't believe you would take him
without me. Mom, I'm so worried about him!

37:10.680 --> 37:12.319
He's my dog, too, you know.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.960
What happened to conan being Otis's dog?

37:15.160 --> 37:16.958
Mom, you're being hysterical, okay?

37:17.040 --> 37:19.120
You should not be driving
in such an emotional state.

37:19.160 --> 37:20.958
I know how you get during emergencies.

37:21.800 --> 37:22.950
I'm a nurse.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.120
Not of animals.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.831
Okay. I'm happy for you to drive.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.071
You weren't wearing your helmet,
by the way.

37:36.160 --> 37:37.640
- I saw that.
- Oh, shoot.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.115
Keep it together, bee.

37:49.800 --> 37:50.800
Sir?

37:52.080 --> 37:53.080
Sir.

37:53.320 --> 37:55.551
I thought
you'd want to see this immediately.

38:00.720 --> 38:02.313
- They sure?
- Yes, sir.

38:02.560 --> 38:04.233
Two of them just made contact in Texas.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.558
Intel says they're heading west fast.

38:06.800 --> 38:08.280
Saddle up, Simmons.

38:09.320 --> 38:10.800
We're going to Texas.

38:12.840 --> 38:15.514
Okay, bee,
we need to go over a few things.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.199
Okay. We're all clear.

38:26.080 --> 38:28.834
All right. I'm re-thinking the beach.

38:31.480 --> 38:32.914
I'm good.

38:33.480 --> 38:34.994
No, I'm good, thanks.

38:37.320 --> 38:40.916
People can be terrible about things
they don't understand.

38:41.160 --> 38:43.720
If they find you, they'll probably
lock you up in a lab somewhere

38:43.800 --> 38:45.240
and cut you into tiny little pieces.

38:45.400 --> 38:48.234
It'll be bad, trust me.

38:51.880 --> 38:55.556
The only person you can show
yourself around is me, okay?

38:57.880 --> 38:59.678
So let's practice. You ready?

39:00.120 --> 39:01.952
If you see anyone besides me,
what do you do?

39:05.320 --> 39:07.471
Great. Perfect. Come back now.

39:09.800 --> 39:12.474
Okay, so let's say we're driving
and all of a sudden...

39:12.640 --> 39:15.075
Oh, shoot! Somebody's here!
Hide, bee, hide!

39:27.560 --> 39:28.914
You serious?

39:33.080 --> 39:35.231
Bee, it's too late. You're already dead.

39:39.320 --> 39:40.674
It's all right.

39:40.840 --> 39:43.912
That's why we're practicing.
You'll get it.

39:44.760 --> 39:48.276
<i>Fox-2 on approach.
Non-biologicals are inbound.</i>

40:05.200 --> 40:08.671
The goal, sir,
should be to communicate with them.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.794
First contact with an alien species.

40:12.520 --> 40:15.354
I've spent my whole life
waiting for this moment.

40:15.640 --> 40:18.633
If they make one wrong move,
we put 'em down.

40:34.040 --> 40:37.238
The humans are multiplying.
Please let me kill them.

40:37.400 --> 40:40.871
Not yet. B-127's signal has gone silent.

40:42.080 --> 40:43.719
I have an idea.

40:45.240 --> 40:48.517
Listen up! I'm agent burns
and this is Dr. Powell.

40:48.880 --> 40:52.351
We currently have 100 guns
pointed right at your head!

40:52.600 --> 40:54.034
So state your business.

40:54.480 --> 40:56.233
People of earth,

40:56.560 --> 41:00.315
we are decepticon peacekeepers
patrolling the galaxy.

41:00.600 --> 41:01.920
What are you doing?

41:02.520 --> 41:04.079
This is humiliating.

41:04.600 --> 41:07.672
We believe a dangerous criminal
from our world

41:07.760 --> 41:10.832
is hiding somewhere on yours.

41:10.920 --> 41:12.513
How is it you think we can help?

41:14.200 --> 41:16.431
We need your eyes.

41:17.280 --> 41:18.350
Wait.

41:18.680 --> 41:20.797
You want access to our satellites?

41:21.040 --> 41:23.271
Our scanners' range is limited.

41:23.600 --> 41:26.672
Your infrastructure is primitive.

41:27.040 --> 41:30.511
But combined,
they could be quite powerful.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.234
No way! Out of the question!

41:32.400 --> 41:35.199
We have a common enemy, agent burns.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.716
There's a war raging on our planet.

41:37.800 --> 41:42.431
If b-127 isn't found,
that war may find its way here.

41:42.560 --> 41:43.880
Perhaps...

41:44.720 --> 41:47.189
We can find a way to help one another.

41:47.960 --> 41:52.637
We'll talk it over with our superiors.
In the meantime, if you could follow us.

41:52.880 --> 41:55.270
Very well, friend Powell.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.278
Take us to your leader.

42:08.080 --> 42:10.834
Must suck being cooped up
in a vw all day, huh?

42:12.480 --> 42:14.836
Is there anyone that can help you?

42:14.920 --> 42:16.354
Do you have a family?

42:16.440 --> 42:20.832
You know, like a mom, dad, siblings?
You all love each other?

42:23.480 --> 42:24.800
Or drive each other crazy

42:24.880 --> 42:27.600
and you can't wait to get away
and start a whole new life.

42:33.920 --> 42:35.593
Do you want me to see if I can fix it?

42:37.960 --> 42:39.519
I'll be gentle, I promise.

42:54.440 --> 42:55.920
You lay down, okay?

42:59.560 --> 43:00.755
Hold still.

43:03.640 --> 43:05.313
I think maybe there's something...

43:17.240 --> 43:21.678
<i>B-127, I pray this message finds you.</i>

43:22.720 --> 43:25.633
<i>Our war rages on.</i>

43:26.200 --> 43:27.520
<i>Planet earth...</i>

43:28.720 --> 43:29.995
<i>Survival...</i>

43:55.160 --> 43:57.595
Ravage, eject!

44:15.440 --> 44:16.954
<i>Your mission...</i>

44:17.120 --> 44:18.349
<i>Soldier...</i>

44:18.520 --> 44:19.590
<i>I...</i>

44:24.040 --> 44:25.394
Are you okay?

44:28.480 --> 44:29.834
Who was that?

44:30.280 --> 44:33.034
That voice said something about a war.

44:34.480 --> 44:35.960
Do you remember anything?

44:39.640 --> 44:43.475
Is the vw beetle some kind of disguise?

44:45.040 --> 44:46.713
Are you hiding from something?

44:49.960 --> 44:51.189
Are you scared?

45:03.960 --> 45:05.110
It's broken.

45:07.360 --> 45:08.396
It's okay.

45:08.840 --> 45:10.399
I think I can help.

45:12.320 --> 45:13.640
Let's go home.

45:18.760 --> 45:20.035
<i>And a basket case,</i>

45:20.600 --> 45:22.273
<i>a Princess...</i>

45:22.360 --> 45:24.016
<i>- And a criminal.</i>
- All right, I'm almost done.

45:24.040 --> 45:25.474
<i>Does that answer your question?</i>

45:26.280 --> 45:28.476
No way. Are you actually watching it?

45:28.560 --> 45:30.233
<i>Don't you forget about me</i>

45:31.240 --> 45:32.720
<i>don't, don't, don't...</i>

45:32.800 --> 45:34.632
You can pop in another one if you want.

45:45.200 --> 45:46.316
<i>Come on, sweetie!</i>

45:47.400 --> 45:49.153
<i>You got this, Charlie girl!</i>

45:53.200 --> 45:54.600
<i>All right, Charlie girl!</i>

45:56.360 --> 45:57.510
<i>Hello, Brighton falls.</i>

45:57.600 --> 45:59.536
<i>This is Charlie Watson,
future olympic gold medalist.</i>

45:59.560 --> 46:00.960
<i>That was so perfect.</i>

46:01.040 --> 46:02.952
<i>- Thanks, dad.
- How do you feel?</i>

46:03.040 --> 46:04.793
No, no, why would you play this?

46:08.520 --> 46:10.193
Sorry. I just...

46:11.240 --> 46:12.356
I finished.

46:17.240 --> 46:18.913
Let's see if we got something.

46:22.080 --> 46:23.230
Okay.

46:32.760 --> 46:33.910
Okay.

46:34.840 --> 46:36.160
All right.

46:42.080 --> 46:43.799
Oh, my god, yes!

46:44.160 --> 46:45.594
It worked!

46:46.320 --> 46:47.879
Look at you go.

46:48.480 --> 46:50.039
You got some moves.

46:57.640 --> 47:00.553
You know, bee, music can help you
say what you're feeling.

47:04.640 --> 47:07.394
You're gonna love this. It's brand new.

47:13.480 --> 47:16.075
<i>Girlfriend in a coma, I know</i>

47:16.400 --> 47:19.199
<i>I know, it's serious</i>

47:21.560 --> 47:22.835
not a smiths fan.

47:24.080 --> 47:25.400
Okay.

47:26.760 --> 47:27.830
Here.

47:28.520 --> 47:29.840
Try this.

47:31.280 --> 47:32.634
<i>Never gonna give you up...</i>

47:36.840 --> 47:38.069
Fine.

47:40.400 --> 47:42.232
Okay, where's my Stevie nicks?

47:45.040 --> 47:46.793
Joan Jett and the blackhearts.

47:48.080 --> 47:49.080
Stones.

47:50.240 --> 47:52.675
Hey, hey,
please don't touch those. Please.

47:58.280 --> 48:00.317
They belonged to my dad.

48:19.200 --> 48:20.429
Do you want to hear it?

48:43.000 --> 48:45.515
We used to listen to this
while we'd work on the corvette.

48:45.680 --> 48:50.152
<i>Oh, my love, my darling...</i>

48:50.960 --> 48:52.599
It was his favorite.

48:52.680 --> 48:56.515
<i>I've hungered for your touch
a long lonely time</i>

48:56.600 --> 48:59.274
he used to say
it would make the car feel better.

49:01.920 --> 49:04.958
<i>Time...</i>

49:06.040 --> 49:10.478
<i>Goes by so slowly</i>

49:10.560 --> 49:13.280
we used to work on this car
every weekend together.

49:13.360 --> 49:16.512
<i>And time can do so much</i>

49:18.200 --> 49:19.634
it was our thing.

49:19.720 --> 49:22.189
<i>Are you still mine?</i>

49:24.520 --> 49:26.000
That tape...

49:26.080 --> 49:29.357
<i>I need your love</i>

49:30.200 --> 49:32.032
that was the last time I saw him.

49:32.120 --> 49:34.476
<i>I need your love</i>

49:36.360 --> 49:37.999
he died of a heart attack.

49:38.120 --> 49:39.793
<i>God speed your love to me</i>

49:40.440 --> 49:42.238
I never got to say goodbye.

49:46.080 --> 49:48.595
You know,
I always thought if I could just

49:49.640 --> 49:52.075
finish fixing this car...

49:52.160 --> 49:55.198
<i>Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea</i>

49:55.560 --> 49:58.837
if I could just get it
to start up again,

50:00.440 --> 50:01.954
he would hear me.

50:04.480 --> 50:06.073
He would hear me.

50:08.960 --> 50:13.352
<i>Oh, my love...</i>

50:44.640 --> 50:46.313
I say this with all due respect.

50:46.720 --> 50:48.200
Have you lost your damn mind?

50:48.280 --> 50:51.239
- That was with all due respect?
- The man's got a point, doctor.

50:51.360 --> 50:54.910
Our satellite network is at the forefront
of our national defense.

50:55.000 --> 50:58.516
Sir, please. It could be
a once in a lifetime opportunity.

50:58.840 --> 51:02.436
Can you imagine the advances an alliance
with these creatures might bring?

51:02.520 --> 51:05.558
I imagine the advances.
An advance on Washington.

51:05.880 --> 51:08.600
- New York. An advance on Chicago!
- That's not gonna happen.

51:08.680 --> 51:11.354
They literally
call themselves "Decepticons."

51:11.440 --> 51:12.920
That doesn't set off any red flags?

51:13.000 --> 51:15.390
Enough! From both of you.

51:15.640 --> 51:16.790
Sir,

51:17.000 --> 51:21.279
we're talking about the most advanced
robotic system ever seen.

51:21.920 --> 51:23.479
If we tell them no,

51:23.680 --> 51:26.957
they'll just take their technology
to the Russians instead.

51:28.840 --> 51:32.197
Do you really want to go down in history
as the man who cost us the cold war?

51:34.840 --> 51:35.876
Fine.

51:36.880 --> 51:39.395
We'll help them find their fugitive.

51:40.040 --> 51:41.713
And when it's done,

51:41.880 --> 51:43.792
you can do all the experiments you want.

51:46.960 --> 51:47.996
Yes, sir.

51:49.080 --> 51:52.152
Gentle... robots.

51:54.160 --> 51:55.719
Welcome to sector 7.

51:56.400 --> 51:59.438
How kind of you to finally allow us in.

51:59.520 --> 52:02.399
We're very happy
to have you here as friends.

52:02.480 --> 52:04.437
Thank you, friend Powell.

52:04.520 --> 52:08.514
My superior has agreed to Grant you
limited access to our satellites.

52:08.760 --> 52:13.835
In addition, you're welcome to use
all of our technology here.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.913
It's the largest super-array
of crays on earth.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.276
We thank you for your hospitality.

52:19.560 --> 52:24.237
Tell me, those vocal communication
devices you use,

52:24.480 --> 52:26.278
do they function worldwide?

52:26.440 --> 52:29.114
The telephones? Yes, why?

52:35.360 --> 52:38.194
You got to pick a station, man.
I know there's a lot of choices.

52:38.280 --> 52:39.960
"You want to go on a date with me, maybe?"

52:41.800 --> 52:42.800
Okay.

52:44.920 --> 52:46.240
What are you trying to do?

52:46.480 --> 52:47.630
Here we go. Here we go.

52:47.720 --> 52:50.680
You're not a nerd. You're not a nerd.
You're not a nerd. You're not a nerd.

52:50.760 --> 52:53.296
Okay, you're a nerd, but just
don't let her see that you're nerdy.

52:53.320 --> 52:55.277
Excuse me. Sorry to barge in. I just...

52:59.920 --> 53:01.070
Do you, just...

53:01.160 --> 53:03.072
No, no, it's fine! Just...

53:03.320 --> 53:06.233
Just sit down, please?
Don't scream, okay?

53:06.840 --> 53:08.115
What is that?

53:08.200 --> 53:09.873
It's okay, okay?
Just breathe. Breathe.

53:10.600 --> 53:12.831
- First of all, hi.
- Hi.

53:13.720 --> 53:15.074
I'm Charlie.

53:15.320 --> 53:16.640
I'm memo, hi.

53:16.800 --> 53:18.029
Hi, memo.

53:19.840 --> 53:21.320
It's nice to meet you.

53:21.600 --> 53:23.114
Pleasure... pleasure...

53:23.280 --> 53:26.637
Look, I know what you saw
was a little crazy. I can explain.

53:28.640 --> 53:30.359
Yeah, I can't explain.
But here's the deal.

53:30.560 --> 53:32.119
If you tell anyone what you just saw,

53:32.200 --> 53:34.032
I'm gonna have to
run you over with my car.

53:36.560 --> 53:37.560
Jeez.

53:37.640 --> 53:38.756
That was...

53:39.040 --> 53:41.953
I don't mean that in a mean way. Okay?
What I'm saying

53:42.120 --> 53:45.591
is no one can know
what you just saw, okay?

53:47.640 --> 53:48.790
You promise?

53:50.400 --> 53:51.400
Yeah.

53:51.480 --> 53:52.596
Okay.

53:57.640 --> 54:00.030
Bumblebee, you can come out now.

54:07.160 --> 54:08.355
What?

54:09.360 --> 54:10.430
It's...

54:11.120 --> 54:12.120
He.

54:18.680 --> 54:22.071
He's been going up and down on that dial
all day today and I don't know why.

54:24.720 --> 54:26.632
- Hey, check out his reflexes.
- What?

54:28.000 --> 54:29.559
Oh, god!

54:30.440 --> 54:31.794
Yo, give me your shirt.

54:31.880 --> 54:33.200
Give me your shirt.

54:33.280 --> 54:34.616
You mean the shirt that I'm wearing?

54:34.640 --> 54:36.256
Yes, yes! Come on.
I'll give it back to you.

54:36.280 --> 54:37.475
Okay.

54:37.560 --> 54:39.791
Come on! Give me your shirt!

54:45.640 --> 54:46.915
All right.

54:52.440 --> 54:55.160
Wait, wait, wait!
Hey, no, no! You don't need to do this.

54:55.240 --> 54:57.675
- Yes, I do.
- No, but...

54:57.760 --> 55:00.150
- Come here. Come on!
- No, I get it. I get it!

55:03.440 --> 55:07.275
<i>There's a room
where the light won't find you</i>

55:07.600 --> 55:08.920
sorry.

55:09.360 --> 55:12.398
I know I promised you, but, yeah,
you're not getting that back.

55:12.560 --> 55:15.394
<i>When they do, I'll be right behind you</i>

55:15.720 --> 55:19.111
<i>so glad we've almost made it</i>

55:20.320 --> 55:24.109
<i>so sad they had to fade it</i>

55:24.200 --> 55:28.353
<i>everybody wants
to rule the world...</i>

55:32.800 --> 55:34.632
It's incredible!

55:35.280 --> 55:38.637
They're combining
our technology seamlessly.

55:38.720 --> 55:41.110
Satellites, phones, computers.

55:41.400 --> 55:45.758
<i>They're creating an interconnected
web of information.</i>

55:45.840 --> 55:48.480
Volumes of data at their fingertips.

55:48.560 --> 55:50.552
It's revolutionary.

55:50.640 --> 55:52.916
He's a weird guy.
You ever notice that about Powell?

55:53.000 --> 55:56.437
They're tracking fluctuations
in energon levels.

55:56.520 --> 56:00.036
It's like a heat signature
specific to their species.

56:00.120 --> 56:01.520
<i>It's astonishing.</i>

56:01.600 --> 56:03.671
<i>It's beautiful. It's...</i>

56:04.240 --> 56:05.720
Hello? Hello?

56:06.160 --> 56:10.074
You've given them our satellites,
our comms, god knows what else.

56:10.160 --> 56:13.278
Yet in the space of a day
they've given us a way

56:13.360 --> 56:17.912
to not only hunt down b-127,
but all of them.

56:19.400 --> 56:22.916
Let them finish what they're doing.
Let them find b-127.

56:23.560 --> 56:26.394
And then I'll give you permission
to destroy them all.

56:26.560 --> 56:28.552
Use them for spare parts.

56:29.840 --> 56:31.240
Sir, yes, sir.

56:32.800 --> 56:35.031
So you have no idea where he came from?

56:35.160 --> 56:36.310
No idea.

56:36.760 --> 56:38.638
You thought about calling the cops?

56:40.000 --> 56:41.275
What are they gonna do, memo?

56:41.360 --> 56:45.354
They're just gonna send him away to a lab
and do weird science experiments on him.

56:45.440 --> 56:46.669
<i>Weird science!</i>

56:47.640 --> 56:49.438
<i>Plastic tubes and pots and pans...</i>

56:50.240 --> 56:52.471
You're getting pretty good
with that radio dial, bee.

56:52.560 --> 56:55.029
Yeah, d.J. Bumble in the house!

56:55.120 --> 56:57.237
<i>I can't live without my radio</i>

56:59.640 --> 57:01.950
is that why
you're always messing with the dial?

57:02.640 --> 57:04.696
You're trying to teach yourself
how to talk, aren't you?

57:04.720 --> 57:08.350
<i>Walk like a man, talk like a man...</i>

57:08.440 --> 57:09.590
No way.

57:09.680 --> 57:12.115
Oh, my god, bee, you're a genius!
You're an actual genius!

57:22.960 --> 57:25.759
- What is going on here?
- That's Jim from sixth period.

57:26.360 --> 57:28.113
He said he was busy this week.

57:28.840 --> 57:30.559
You want to check it out?

57:33.760 --> 57:35.911
- This is pretty cool.
- Okay.

57:36.320 --> 57:37.800
Bee, we'll be right back.

57:38.240 --> 57:39.879
Don't do anything crazy.

57:40.720 --> 57:42.791
Hey, everybody, come watch!
Tripp's gonna jump!

57:42.880 --> 57:43.950
You're off your nut.

57:44.040 --> 57:46.056
- What's going on over there?
- Don't do it, dude, you're crazy.

57:46.080 --> 57:47.594
Come on, it's not that big a jump.

57:47.680 --> 57:49.592
God, is that Tripp summers?

57:49.680 --> 57:51.160
You know Tripp?

57:51.360 --> 57:54.080
I mean, yeah. I spilled
a gallon of lemonade on him once.

57:54.160 --> 57:57.437
Doesn't anyone have the balls
to jump off this thing with me?

58:01.520 --> 58:03.239
A brave volunteer.

58:03.320 --> 58:05.696
Yeah, I... see, I didn't...
I didn't do that. I didn't actually...

58:05.720 --> 58:07.359
<i>You got the touch</i>

58:09.200 --> 58:13.672
<i>you got the power</i>

58:14.520 --> 58:15.520
<i>yeah</i>

58:15.800 --> 58:18.190
hey, I know you.

58:18.960 --> 58:20.872
No, sorry about that. It...

58:20.960 --> 58:23.031
You were on the dive team
with my little sister.

58:23.120 --> 58:25.191
I saw you win state a couple years ago.

58:26.960 --> 58:28.872
- Yeah.
- Ladies and gentlemen.

58:29.040 --> 58:30.759
This just got
a whole lot more interesting.

58:30.840 --> 58:34.038
We have a championship high-diver
on our hands!

58:37.320 --> 58:39.312
Yeah, I actually, I don't, I don't...

58:39.480 --> 58:40.550
I don't do it anymore.

58:40.640 --> 58:42.950
Don't worry. I won't make you go first.

58:48.520 --> 58:49.520
Watch it!

58:49.600 --> 58:50.716
Yeah, Tripp!

58:53.360 --> 58:54.760
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

58:57.560 --> 59:00.553
Dive girl!
You better not back out on me.

59:06.320 --> 59:08.994
You guys, she's gonna do it!
She's gonna do it!

59:09.080 --> 59:13.199
Dive! Dive! Dive! Dive!

59:14.240 --> 59:15.276
Come on!

59:15.360 --> 59:19.400
Dive! Dive! Dive! Dive!

59:20.600 --> 59:22.831
<i>You got this, Charlie girl!</i>

59:32.720 --> 59:35.076
- Where you going?
- What, are you scared?

59:35.160 --> 59:36.514
- You okay?
- Let's just go.

59:36.600 --> 59:38.080
What a loser!

59:38.160 --> 59:39.776
Thought you said
you were on the diving team.

59:39.800 --> 59:42.156
I think she's gonna cry in her car.

59:44.440 --> 59:46.113
Where you going, sweetie?

59:54.400 --> 59:58.110
What happened out there?
That was your big moment to look cool.

59:58.520 --> 59:59.920
What's your damage, Tina?

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.400
Is that the churro guy?

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:02.960
Where's your hairnet, dude?

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.078
It's in the garbage, Einstein.
You throw them away after each use.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:09.312
For sanitary purposes, obviously, but...

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:12.313
This car is an embarrassment.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.670
You should have your dad
buy you a better one.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.755
Oh, wait...

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.080
Sorry.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.589
You okay?

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.280
I'm fine.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.909
They're idiots.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.801
But I think I know something
that'll make you feel better.

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:50.789
What?

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.997
Revenge.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.635
I don't want revenge.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.120
I do.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.431
What about you, bee?
Want some revenge?

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:00.874
<i>I just want...</i>

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.269
<i>Revenge!</i>

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.200
<i>I'm mad</i>

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.918
come on. I got an idea.

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:12.673
This is Tina's house.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.550
And this, it's toilet paper.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.313
You use it for when you...

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.875
Here, just take a roll.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:28.353
No, no, no, no. You've got...

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.513
You got to throw it.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.430
Like this.

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.356
Not bad.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.757
Not... yeah...

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:55.514
Okay, look, bee, you be our egg man.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.557
- Right? Yeah. So...
- Love that.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.312
You see these right here?

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.634
You grab one of these, like so.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:09.112
- And that right there, that's your target.
- That's right.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.759
All right? Just throw it like this.

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:15.920
- I think we could just hand it to him...
- He could maybe, yeah, and then...

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.233
- Bee, what are...
- What...

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.075
Don't hurt me.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.230
Oh, my god...

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:42.400
Oh, shit!

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.797
- Hide, hide, hide.
- Hide!

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:52.676
- Stay...
- Okay!

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:54.035
Okay. Okay.

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.440
Hide, bee!

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.794
Go, go, go!

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.549
Mom!

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:42.313
That was insane!

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:45.438
My heart right now is going crazy.

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.879
- Oh, god.
- Stop the car, please.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:52.157
Bee, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:56.753
<i>I can't drive 55!</i>

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.280
Bumblebee!

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:07.279
<i>I can't drive 55!</i>

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:14.717
<i>I can't drive 55!</i>

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:21.918
<i>I can't drive 55!</i>

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.229
Oh, my god!

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:30.153
<i>I can't drive 55!</i>

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.912
Oh, my god, we're committing a felony!

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:40.109
<i>When I drive that slow, you know
it's hard to steer</i>

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:47.038
we got a yellow vehicle driving
its damn self through the pico tunnel.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.640
<i>"We're gonna throw your ass
in the cityjoint"</i>

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.594
<i>looked me in the eye
said, "you get my point?"</i>

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:00.990
<i>I said yeah! Oh, yeah!</i>

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:31.480
Good night.

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:36.796
Good night.

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:47.994
Good night, bee.

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.915
Morning, buddy.
I got to go to work, okay?

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.510
Bee. Listen to me.
You need to stay in this garage, okay?

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.798
After what happened last night, I'm pretty
sure the cops are looking for you,

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.520
and you don't exactly blend in.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.273
I'll be back, all right?

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.076
Here.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:25.674
You can have my pop-tart.

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:41.278
I need you to go to the
frozen banana stand and steal some sticks.

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.760
We're out of sticks.

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:46.196
Can't we just sell the hot dogs
without the sticks?

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:47.840
No.

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:28.395
What's happening here?

01:09:28.479 --> 01:09:30.216
We got a hit, I think.
Where's that location?

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:33.517
Near San Francisco.
A coastal town named Brighton falls.

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:54.357
You have a personal call.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.992
- Hello?
<i>- Charlie, hey, it's memo.</i>

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:03.551
You got to come home right now.

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.150
It's bad. It's really, really bad.

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:19.920
Where's Bumblebee?

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.191
Bumblebee, what have you done?

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:31.158
What were you thinking? What...

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:34.236
I told you to hide in the garage!

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.390
Great.

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.479
Helpful shame spiral, bee.

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:44.871
I'm not mad, okay? This is all my fault.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.953
I never should have left you.

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:53.637
Hey, okay, maybe don't transform
all the way?

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:55.871
We've still got
to get you through the door.

01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.515
Come on, buddy.

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:00.829
It's okay.

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.440
I am so screwed.

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.600
And now you're crippled for life.

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:39.319
Honey, watch the hair.

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:48.000
Go. Now. But be quiet.

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.400
Mom, wait!

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:53.035
Oh, my god!

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.713
- Mom...
- What happened?

01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.757
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:01.354
What'd you do to my TV?

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:04.990
Look, mom, I can explain.
We will talk about this later, all right?

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:06.958
- Now, I have to go.
- Are you kidding me?

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.634
No. You're not going anywhere.

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:11.719
- It's about my car. It's really important.
- About your car?

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:15.840
That you spend all day and night shut
in that garage, doing god-knows-what with?

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.957
Mom, I can't. I really can't right now.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:20.236
Oh, no, you really can, Charlie.

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:22.277
You really can.

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.400
I have had it!

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:26.200
Your attitude, your always sulking around.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:29.757
You brought home that piece of crap
without even asking me!

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.799
Everyone in this family
is trying to be happy,

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:35.315
and all you want to do
is make things harder.

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.312
You know, mom,
just because you've moved on

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:40.154
and you're happy with your new life
doesn't mean I have!

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:44.635
You've found a replacement for my dad
and I haven't, okay, and I never will!

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:48.555
So I'm sorry if that makes things harder,
but in ten months from now

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:50.513
you won't even have to deal with me!

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:53.715
Charlie!

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.120
Hey, you okay?

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:07.956
Yeah.

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:12.797
I just feel like ever since my dad died,

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:15.839
I've become this drain on everyone,
and I hate it.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:20.990
It's like everybody expects me
to act like nothing ever happened,

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:23.356
and it's impossible to do that.

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:28.798
About your dad, I'm really sorry.

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.476
Thanks.

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:34.080
You know, there's this quote that I like.

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:39.157
"The darkest nights
produce the brightest stars."

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:44.880
That's nice.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.673
My mom got it from weight watchers.

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:05.235
Get out and move away from the vehicle.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.994
Stay cool, bee.

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.440
What's going on?

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:20.880
Hey!

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.440
- Come on!
- Stop it!

01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:24.475
Let go of me!

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.991
- Weapons now! Take it down!
- Run!

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.913
No, don't run. Do not run!

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:34.840
She ran.

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.074
Please tell me they're on our side.

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:14.753
No more running.

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:16.799
No more hiding.

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:25.352
B-127, you're a traitor and a coward.

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:27.791
Tell us where optimus prime is hiding.

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.349
Bee, look out!

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:36.274
Why isn't he fighting back?

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:38.280
Why don't you fight?

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.154
Leave him alone! Please!

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.160
Again.

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:49.920
Hit it again!

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:52.960
Stop! Stop it!

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:26.440
Your daughter stole
government property, Mrs. Watson.

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.836
She's been having trouble adjusting,

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:31.480
but we had no idea it was this serious.

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:32.755
I...

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:34.160
Charlie. Honey.

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:36.960
I didn't steal anything,
and he doesn't belong to them.

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:38.720
- "He?"
- Ma'am.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.235
I can assure you that it is an "it".

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:43.391
And "it" is a highly dangerous
war machine.

01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:46.552
No, he isn't, okay, mom?
He's not some "war machine."

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:49.599
I don't know what he is, but...

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:51.274
He's my friend.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:54.315
Ma'am, your daughter's had
a traumatic experience today.

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.711
Maybe doesn't understand
everything she's seen.

01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:58.195
She's disoriented.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:00.795
No, I'm fine, mom.
I'm completely fine, okay?

01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:03.600
You have to believe me, please.
I didn't steal anything!

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.871
Stop! Just go to your room.

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:14.952
When I was going through puberty,

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.959
I stole things, too.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.160
- Stole a box of mallomars once.
- Yeah, we know.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:05.880
Boom.

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:08.394
Caught you.

01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:10.473
Mom's gonna love this.

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:12.279
Look, Otis, you need to go home and...

01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:13.874
Mom!

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.754
No, Otis, stop it!
Why would you do that?

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:19.435
Let go of me!
You're touching my buttocks!

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:22.319
I will tell you a secret if you shut up.

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:27.315
Okay, so this is my room.

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.153
Just make yourself at home.

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:31.277
These are actually my sister's stuff.

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:34.159
She likes playing pranks,
like putting her stuff over here.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.516
- Can I sit down?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:38.136
<i>Residents of Brighton falls
have been witness</i>

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:40.595
<i>to an unusual sight this evening.</i>

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:43.957
<i>Armed forces pouring into town
as part of what we are told</i>

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:46.839
<i>is a routine military exercise</i>

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:49.754
<i>setting up camp
at our own McKinnon air base.</i>

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:52.514
If Bumblebee's still alive,
that's where they're keeping him.

01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:54.991
We have to go.
We have to try and save him.

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:56.673
Count me in. I'll take point.

01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:59.440
- No, you won't.
- Come on.

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:00.590
No, Otis.

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:03.240
- But I can help. Master Larry says I...
- I need someone here.

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:07.076
I need someone reliable to make sure
that mom and Ron don't know that I'm gone.

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:08.960
I'm someone reliable.

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.075
Hell, yeah, you are.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.229
Good luck.

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:19.990
You, too.

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:21.760
Get over here.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.229
Let's do this.

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:34.913
Tell us where optimus prime
and the rebels are hiding,

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:37.714
and we can end this war.

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:41.040
Talk!

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.316
Who is optimus prime?

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:45.631
This doesn't concern you, human Powell.

01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:48.237
Last chance.

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.279
Are you sure this is a good idea?

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.509
It's a terrible idea,
but I've got to try it.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.920
You can't get... well, why don't you...
Stop, stop, wait...

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:05.079
- How'd you know the power was off?
- I didn't. Let's go.

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:12.029
Can I?

01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:14.231
His memory cells are fried.

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:16.116
Finish him.

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:27.830
<i>We will fight on. Regroup, rebuild,
and retake our home.</i>

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:30.116
<i>But we must find refuge first.</i>

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.113
<i>You will travel to earth.</i>

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:34.760
<i>Once we've gathered the others,
we'll join you.</i>

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:37.230
<i>You must protect the planet.</i>

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:42.475
<i>If the Decepticons find it,
then our people are truly finished.</i>

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:44.552
<i>Stay safe, soldier.</i>

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:47.111
<i>I am coming.</i>

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:51.236
Prime is coming here?

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:53.591
They're all coming here.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.960
This is our chance to wipe out
the autobot resistance for good.

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:01.152
We'll burn the whole planet to cinders.

01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:04.031
We must get word to cybertron immediately.

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.190
<i>This is burns.</i>

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:07.158
Tell them to bring an army.

01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:10.071
Burns, we made a terrible mistake.

01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:11.435
Powell?

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:14.240
And thanks to our human allies,

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:16.630
I know just how to get the message home.

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:18.439
They're using our satellites.

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:20.434
<i>They're calling an army.</i>

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:21.994
They're gonna kill us all.

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:27.557
Thank you for your hospitality,
friend Powell.

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:29.320
He's all yours.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:31.720
- No.
<i>- Powell?</i>

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.314
<i>- You have to stop them!</i>
- Powell!

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:39.474
Where's the krazy glue?

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:41.836
What, did she cut the wire to the TV?

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:43.550
Ron.

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:45.995
Charlie!

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:47.320
Charlie!

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.790
Nice! Reel-to-reel still works.

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.320
Where is your sister?

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:57.917
Charlie's fallen ill and must stay in
her bedroom for the rest of the evening.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.277
She wishes not to be troubled.
Keep clear of her chambers.

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:02.596
What?

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:08.354
Charlie has fallen ill

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:11.194
and must stay in her bedroom
for the rest of the evening.

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:13.630
- She wishes not to...
- Otis!

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.200
Are you on drugs?

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:17.400
No, no. Mom, mom, mom.

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:19.153
- Please stop. Stop!
- Charlie!

01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:21.277
- Mom, there is no reason to go...
- Where is she?

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.238
- Mom, stop!
- Quit it, Otis.

01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:30.469
Where is she?

01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:35.474
Otis?

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.316
I found a tower to transmit our message.

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:41.836
It's close.

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:47.274
B-127. I almost forgot.

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.680
I didn't.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.434
No! Don't shoot!

01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:55.476
No!

01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:12.390
Bee!

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:16.360
Talk to me, bee, talk to me.

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:25.634
I can fix this. I can fix this.

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:30.910
Charlie.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.993
You got to wake up, bee.
You got to wake up.

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:35.360
Please.

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.959
Charlie, we got to go.

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:44.869
- The gun.
- What?

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:46.440
The electric gun. Get it.

01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:50.154
I can fix you.

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.114
Come on, bee.

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.554
Come back to me.

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:03.519
Come on, give me the other one.

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:11.513
Bee, come on.

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:15.399
I can't lose you, too, bee.

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:17.149
Please, bee!

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:32.440
I'm sorry.

01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:58.440
Oh, my god.

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:01.472
Come on, bee,
we've got to get you out of here.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.959
Charlie, there's like
a million guys out there!

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.069
We got to move, now.

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:21.360
Come on, bee, you've gotta get up.
Can you get up?

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:24.153
There's a door in my way.

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:27.915
They've got bombs!

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.434
- We got to go.
- Bee, come on.

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:32.516
Charlie!

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:33.795
You've gotta get up, come on.

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:36.080
- Three.
- Charlie!

01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:37.874
- Two.
- Come on.

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:39.116
One.

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.395
- Charlie!
- Come on.

01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:58.669
Memo?

01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:04.873
Memo. Memo, wake up.

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:07.960
Easy.

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:12.080
Easy.

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.120
Hold your fire!

01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:17.873
Get the kid out of here.

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:21.277
Memo! Wake up, memo!

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:24.477
- Come on, kid.
- Hey! No!

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:26.670
Bee!

01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:27.996
Run!

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:31.280
Bee!

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:33.710
Run!

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.960
- Let go of me!
- You need to get away from that thing.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.912
- Take it down!
- No, stop!

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:45.234
- Stop it!
- Contain it and dismantle it!

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.073
Strip it down to parts!

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:50.280
Leave him alone! You don't understand.

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:53.040
Fight back, bee!

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:55.789
- Bee!
- Kid, stop! It's a machine!

01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:58.190
He's more human than you'll ever be!

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:00.360
That is enough!

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:24.360
Oh, shit.

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:36.796
Open fire!

01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:51.917
Fall back! Take cover!

01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:08.480
Bee!

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:12.310
Bee!

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.154
Bee, stop!

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:38.355
You remember, don't you?

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:44.680
They're coming back.

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:51.275
Oh, god.

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:53.240
Are you okay?

01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:56.236
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:58.433
We need to get out of here.

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:01.593
We've got to get you some place safe.

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:06.997
Bee, stop. They will kill you!

01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:09.637
<i>If the Decepticons find earth,</i>

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:13.033
<i>then our people are truly finished.</i>

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:17.275
Okay. Then we fight.

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:26.754
Let's go, get in.

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:31.397
Go on. I'll buy you some time
with these guys.

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:43.880
You just kiss me?

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:46.440
On the cheek.

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:47.840
Still counts.

01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:55.360
Still counts.

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:06.280
Halt!

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:09.114
Stop.

01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:15.189
Well, that didn't work.

01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:23.476
Move, move!

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:41.353
Faster, bee, faster!

01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:45.976
We should really look
into getting seatbelts.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.229
Oh, my god, oh, my god.

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:49.856
It's okay. She's gonna steal
the robot back, fight off the police,

01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:51.696
kill two bigger robots,
and come right back home.

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:52.870
Shut up, Otis.

01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:54.360
<i>Folks, this just breaking.</i>

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:57.274
<i>There appears to be
a high-speed chase underway</i>

01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:59.113
<i>just outside McKinnon air base.</i>

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:00.395
Go right! Go right!

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:15.231
Closer. Closer.

01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:18.438
You lose that car,
I will personally rip your face off.

01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:24.311
- Oh, god!
- It's all under control.

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:30.314
- Charlie!
- Mom?

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:32.551
You pull that car over right this second.

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:34.791
This is very unsafe, what you're doing.

01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:36.553
Mom, you got to get out of here, okay?

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:41.960
Mom...

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:44.032
You have to trust me, please!

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:46.670
Charlie!

01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:48.877
- We got to help her, Ron!
- Hang on.

01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:53.433
Oh, my god! Ron!

01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:57.990
Get out of the way!

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.592
Oh, my gosh! What are you doing?

01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:02.160
I saw this on <i>Miami vice.</i>

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:06.760
God!

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:10.510
- I got it, I got it, I got it.
- Oh, my god!

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:35.949
Nice driving, Ron.

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.354
Is everyone okay?

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:43.754
Ron! We have a kid in the car!

01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:46.594
I was trying to save the other kid!
What was I...

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.274
It was a lose-lose.

01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:51.035
Otis? Otis, are you all right?

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:55.638
That was radical.

01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:25.475
Preparing satellites
to transmit our message.

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:46.513
Okay. What's the plan?

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:56.070
This is the plan? I hate this plan.
Bee, I want to help.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.836
<i>I would hate anything
to happen to her</i>

01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:05.914
you're actually talking.
And you're listening to the smiths.

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:17.320
Be careful.

01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:29.513
Handle him! And finish the job this time!

01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:47.320
Oh, shit!

01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:16.513
How the hell am I gonna get up there?

01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:53.676
There. The one on the tower.

01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:56.556
You think these little chains can hold...

01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:10.435
Okay.

01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:37.358
Hold on!

01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:58.553
What are you doing?

01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:39.035
Come on.

01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:45.276
Come on.

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:06.520
No.

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:32.639
After I kill you, I kill her.

01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:33.836
Bee, no!

01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:38.956
You missed.

01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:47.234
You'll kill us both!

01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:58.480
Bumblebee!

01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:20.800
Oh, god.

01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:23.954
You.

01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:31.640
You need to get outta here.

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:34.720
What do you mean?

01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:36.314
I mean my friends are coming.

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:38.839
And they're gonna be looking for him.

01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:43.914
Thank you.

01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:47.760
Thank you.

01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:04.274
Hey, soldier!

01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:37.153
I'm here. I made it.

01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:39.555
What's going on?

01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:41.959
World's already been saved, kid.

01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:44.400
Cool.

01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:47.274
Cool.

01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:52.356
Hey, can you call my mom?

01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:02.120
This is it, bee.

01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:25.959
<i>Let's go!</i>

01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:28.880
Bee, I can't go with you.

01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:41.631
You've got people out there that need you.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.480
And so do I.

01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:57.114
I gotta let you go.

01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:05.830
<i>Thank you...</i>

01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:07.240
<i>So much...</i>

01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:08.476
<i>For giving me...</i>

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:09.755
<i>My voice.</i>

01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:16.117
Thank you for...

01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:19.632
For making me feel like me again.

01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:26.600
I'll never forget you.

01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:39.999
Goodbye, Bumblebee.

01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:10.679
No way.

01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:13.272
You kidding me?

01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:17.438
Are you telling me you could've been
a Camaro this whole time?

01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:20.271
Oh, my god!

01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:25.592
<i>Don't you forget about me</i>

01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:29.994
<i>don't, don't, don't</i>

01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:33.630
<i>don't you forget about me</i>

01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:41.435
<i>will you stand above me</i>

01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:46.356
<i>look my way never love me?</i>

01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:50.912
<i>Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling</i>

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.550
<i>down, down, down</i>

01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:59.396
<i>will you recognize me</i>

01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:03.076
<i>call my name or walk on by...</i>

01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:08.960
Here you go, ma'am.

01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:18.196
Baby.

01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:19.949
Thank god you're all right.

01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:21.676
Thanks for coming, mom.

01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:29.359
That was some driving, Ron.

01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:31.716
Well, I've taken a few notes.

01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:35.280
Otis.

01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:38.350
They forced me to tell.

01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:42.035
I'm glad they did.

01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:44.560
I couldn't have done it without you guys.

01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:51.035
Hey, Charlie.

01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:58.234
I'll be right back, okay?

01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:05.071
What happened to you today?

01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:06.310
This?

01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:10.952
You know, robot fights, high-speed chases,
international disasters.

01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:13.440
The usual.

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:14.920
- Right.
- Yeah.

01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:29.035
Yeah...

01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:30.835
- Not quite there yet.
- Nope.

01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:32.195
- Yep. Okay, okay.
- No. Yeah.

01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:54.357
Old friend,
you kept this planet safe.

01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:59.989
Because of you,
we have a future, b-127.

01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:01.355
<i>My name...</i>

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:02.510
<i>Is...</i>

01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:03.756
<i>Bumblebee.</i>

01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:31.513
Let's see if we got something.

01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:34.034
Oh, my god, yes!
