[Holt] And I believe

00:03.838 --> 00:05.798
that's all I've got.

00:05.840 --> 00:07.633
Oh, wait,

00:05.840 --> 00:07.633
there's one more thing.

00:07.675 --> 00:10.218
Peralta gave me a note

00:07.675 --> 00:10.218
before the meeting.

00:11.679 --> 00:14.974
Ugh, the penmanship is horrid,

00:11.679 --> 00:14.974
but I think it says,

00:15.015 --> 00:17.351
"Ask if anyone has

00:15.015 --> 00:17.351
an anal mint."

00:17.392 --> 00:19.060
It's announcements,

00:17.392 --> 00:19.060
and we do.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.729
Wow, what an entrance.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.524
Amy and I have

00:20.771 --> 00:23.524
some big news to share.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.693
-I'm pregnant.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.693
-We're pregnant!

00:25.734 --> 00:28.195
-[Rosa] What a surprise.

00:28.236 --> 00:30.405
What the hell?

00:28.236 --> 00:30.405
I thought you guys would

00:28.236 --> 00:30.405
be more excited than that.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.699
Charles, you didn't even faint.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.826
I'm so sorry, I'll try.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.247
Sorry, we're so happy for you,

00:39.289 --> 00:41.500
but we also maybe,

00:39.289 --> 00:41.500
kind of already knew.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.711
I mean, you didn't do

00:41.542 --> 00:43.711
the best job of hiding it.

00:43.752 --> 00:47.631
-Why have you been carrying

00:43.752 --> 00:47.631
that box around so much?

00:43.752 --> 00:47.631
-I just love this box.

00:47.673 --> 00:49.591
Why are you reading

00:47.673 --> 00:49.591
that newspaper?

00:47.673 --> 00:49.591
It's two days old.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.010
I just love this issue.

00:51.050 --> 00:52.260
Hey, why are you wearing

00:51.050 --> 00:52.260
that hazmat suit?

00:52.302 --> 00:53.679
I just love this look.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.597
Okay, fine, so you all

00:53.721 --> 00:55.597
knew we were pregnant.

00:55.639 --> 00:57.683
Good for you.

00:55.639 --> 00:57.683
But I bet you didn't figure out

00:57.725 --> 00:59.184
that we're having twins.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.020
[gasps]

01:01.061 --> 01:02.521
No, not really.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.521
It's one baby.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.272
I just needed to

01:02.563 --> 01:04.272
see Charles faint.

[theme music playing]

01:24.376 --> 01:25.711
[Roger] Aw, Jake.

01:25.753 --> 01:28.213
I am excited that

01:25.753 --> 01:28.213
you're having a kid.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.173
[Jake] Thank you, Dad.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.173
Oh, and hey, if you're free

01:28.255 --> 01:30.173
next Friday,

01:30.215 --> 01:31.550
we're having

01:30.215 --> 01:31.550
a sex reveal party.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.468
Well, I went to one

01:31.592 --> 01:33.468
of those in Amsterdam.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.804
I would not invite relatives.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.305
What? No, no, no.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.640
It's a party where we

01:37.347 --> 01:38.640
find out the biological sex

01:38.682 --> 01:40.183
of the baby in

01:38.682 --> 01:40.183
a surprising way.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.643
You better hope

01:40.225 --> 01:41.643
you're having a girl.

01:41.685 --> 01:44.021
Peralta fathers do not

01:41.685 --> 01:44.021
get along with sons.

01:44.063 --> 01:45.689
What? That's not true.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.357
I mean, look at us.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.357
We're doing better than ever.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.401
This year, you even remembered

01:47.399 --> 01:49.401
my birthday month.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.194
Things are good now,

01:49.443 --> 01:51.194

01:51.236 --> 01:53.822
-it's probably just a blip.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.822
-Well, that's fun to hear.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.240
Well, that's just

01:53.864 --> 01:55.240
the way it is.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.700
It's the family curse.

01:56.742 --> 01:58.869
I haven't talked to my father

01:56.742 --> 01:58.869
since you were 10.

01:58.911 --> 02:01.371
His dad abandoned him

01:58.911 --> 02:01.371
at the World's Fair.

02:01.413 --> 02:05.960
His dad fled to America after

02:01.413 --> 02:05.960
drowning his dad in a well.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.419
Oh, my God.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.755
Okay, so yes, fine,

02:07.461 --> 02:09.755
there's a bit of a trend.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.590
But we're not cursed.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.590
You and I are good.

I bet you could even

02:11.632 --> 02:13.508
fix things up with your dad.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.887
The Admiral?

02:13.550 --> 02:16.887
I always hoped that I could

02:13.550 --> 02:16.887
reconcile things with him

02:16.929 --> 02:18.973
one day, but he's not

02:16.929 --> 02:18.973
going to let that happen.

02:19.014 --> 02:21.683
What can I tell you?

02:19.014 --> 02:21.683
We're not meant to have sons.

There's a demon in our genes.

-What?

02:34.822 --> 02:37.240
about how my wife's leaving me,

Yeah, broken windows,

02:46.667 --> 02:48.502
The house belongs

02:46.667 --> 02:48.502
to a friend of the mayor's.

02:48.543 --> 02:52.006
Oh, I didn't realize

02:48.543 --> 02:52.006
the case was a priority.

No, the Carroll Street case.

03:02.307 --> 03:05.102
I didn't realize that the

03:02.307 --> 03:05.102
mayor was interested in it,

03:05.144 --> 03:07.896
and I think I did

03:05.144 --> 03:07.896
something bad.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.155
it's a girl.

And if it's blue, it's a boy.

And why do you seem

03:17.489 --> 03:18.949
so bummed by that?

03:18.991 --> 03:20.617
Because I still think you

03:18.991 --> 03:20.617
should have done

03:20.659 --> 03:22.619

-Yeah.

05:15.607 --> 05:17.442
I'm so glad you

05:15.607 --> 05:17.442
reached out to me.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.694
Same, you know, now that

05:17.484 --> 05:19.694
I'm having a baby of my own,

05:19.736 --> 05:21.446
I've started to realize

05:19.736 --> 05:21.446
how important

05:21.488 --> 05:23.740
father-son-grandfather

05:21.488 --> 05:23.740
relationships really are.

05:23.782 --> 05:26.743
Which reminds me,

05:23.782 --> 05:26.743
my dad is also coming.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.954
He is? I'm surprised

05:26.785 --> 05:28.954
he wanted to see me.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.498
Well, he doesn't exactly

05:28.996 --> 05:31.498
know you're here.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.792
I thought it might be cool

05:31.539 --> 05:33.792
to surprise both of you.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.003
You know who else

05:33.834 --> 05:36.003
thought surprises were cool?

05:36.044 --> 05:39.256
Admiral Yamamoto, and we all

05:36.044 --> 05:39.256
know what happened then, huh?

05:39.298 --> 05:40.381
-We do?

05:39.298 --> 05:40.381
-Pearl Harbor.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.050
Pearl Harbor, right.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.718
Some surprises can be bad.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.718
But this one's not gonna be.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.344
This one's gonna

05:43.760 --> 05:45.344
be good, just like...

05:45.386 --> 05:46.972
-The Battle of Midway.

05:45.386 --> 05:46.972
-The Bimble of Durbay, yup.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.265
We both said the same

05:47.014 --> 05:48.265
thing at the same time.

05:48.307 --> 05:49.766
[knocking]

05:48.307 --> 05:49.766
Oh, that's my Dad.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.143
This is going to be amazing.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.895
-Hey, Jakey.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.895
-Roger Peralta.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.605
Prepare to hug and cry.

05:55.647 --> 05:58.066
This is your father.

05:59.358 --> 06:02.196
Dad, you son of a bitch.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.447
Uh-oh.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.447
Ow!

06:07.075 --> 06:09.536
[groans]

06:07.075 --> 06:09.536
I can't believe you hit me.

06:09.577 --> 06:10.829
I'm sorry.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.706
My face is throbbing.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.706
Hey, "Dino Bites."

06:12.747 --> 06:14.082
What the hell is

06:12.747 --> 06:14.082
my father doing here?

06:14.124 --> 06:15.876
You said you wanted

06:14.124 --> 06:15.876
to reconcile.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.544
I meant after he was dead.

06:17.585 --> 06:19.213
I planned on standing

06:17.585 --> 06:19.213
over his grave

06:19.254 --> 06:21.006
and yelling, "I forgive you."

06:21.048 --> 06:22.883
Well, you may get the chance

06:21.048 --> 06:22.883
sooner than you think.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.592
He keeps trailing off

06:22.924 --> 06:24.592
and staring into space.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.012
[scoffs]

06:24.634 --> 06:27.012
That's his old trick.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.471
Whenever he doesn't want

06:27.054 --> 06:28.471
to talk about something,

06:28.513 --> 06:30.307
he does that.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.307
The old bastard.

06:30.349 --> 06:32.100
Look, I know

06:30.349 --> 06:32.100
you don't like him,

06:32.142 --> 06:35.270
but can you at least

06:32.142 --> 06:35.270
try to be nice for me?

06:35.312 --> 06:37.647
Okay.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.107
I'll be nice.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.484
I wish you were dead,

06:39.149 --> 06:41.484
you lousy son of a bitch!

06:41.526 --> 06:43.028
You said you were

06:41.526 --> 06:43.028
gonna be nice.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.155
I lied so I could say

06:43.070 --> 06:45.155
the "son of a bitch" thing.

06:45.197 --> 06:46.656
-Dad!

06:45.197 --> 06:46.656
-Okay.

06:46.698 --> 06:50.118
Your grandson would like

06:46.698 --> 06:50.118
us to make peace.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.454
So, do you apologize

06:50.160 --> 06:53.454
for being the worst father

06:53.496 --> 06:55.082
in the history in the world?

06:53.496 --> 06:55.082
Even worse than fathers

06:55.123 --> 06:56.666
who chain their children

06:55.123 --> 06:56.666
in basements?

06:56.708 --> 06:58.710
-I do not.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.710
-That's on him. I tried.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.795
I really don't think you did.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.795
Jake, you don't get it.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.130
He's a heartless jerk.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.631
When I was in high school,

07:02.172 --> 07:03.631
I almost died.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.133
He didn't even visit me

07:03.673 --> 07:05.133
in the hospital.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.052
Okay, so maybe

07:05.175 --> 07:07.052
start by asking him

07:07.094 --> 07:08.220
to apologize for that.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.471
No, he should apologize to me

07:10.513 --> 07:11.848
for being in the hospital.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.641
I'm starting to see

07:11.890 --> 07:13.641
the heartless thing now.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.561
Growing up, he had a boat.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.561
Meant everything to him.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.605
He named it "Walter,"

07:16.603 --> 07:18.605
after himself.

07:18.646 --> 07:20.315
She was the child

07:18.646 --> 07:20.315
I never had.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.192
I was the child you did have.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.903
Anyway, one day I took

07:22.234 --> 07:24.903
Walter Junior out for a spin.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.572
I was trying to impress

07:24.945 --> 07:27.572
one of the lake girls.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.158
Before I met your mom, I was

07:27.614 --> 07:30.158
a bit of a ladies' man.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.119
Yes, that continued

07:30.200 --> 07:32.119
long after you met my mom.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.121
-He's always been a floozy.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.121
-It was dark.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.706
I crashed into the dock.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.706
I woke up in the hospital.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.041
-How was the girl?

07:36.748 --> 07:38.041
-Flexible.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.293
Man, she could put her leg--

07:38.083 --> 07:39.293
total--

07:39.334 --> 07:41.211
No, I was--

07:39.334 --> 07:41.211
after the accident.

07:41.253 --> 07:42.545
Oh, right! No.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.089
She was totally unhurt,

07:42.587 --> 07:44.089
thank goodness.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.424
But I was in the hospital

07:44.131 --> 07:45.424
for three weeks,

07:45.465 --> 07:48.885
and Admiral Ass

07:45.465 --> 07:48.885
never visited me once.

07:48.927 --> 07:51.054
I warned you not to

07:48.927 --> 07:51.054
take the boat out.

07:51.096 --> 07:53.598
You make mistakes, you got

07:51.096 --> 07:53.598
to accept the consequences.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.351
-I'm your son!

07:53.640 --> 07:56.351
-And Walter was my daughter.

07:56.393 --> 07:57.978
-[groan]

07:56.393 --> 07:57.978
-Okay, both of you, stop.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.938
You're acting like children.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.938
You know what?

07:59.980 --> 08:01.731
That's it, if you're gonna

07:59.980 --> 08:01.731
act like kids,

08:01.773 --> 08:03.691
then I'm gonna act

08:01.773 --> 08:03.691
like a parent.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.568
-"Cry Hard with a Vengeance"?

08:03.733 --> 08:05.568
-Yeah.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.862
It's Bruce Willis' book

08:05.610 --> 08:07.862
about parenting.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.530
And we're gonna read it.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.907
[Amy] I just got another call

08:10.949 --> 08:12.492
from the saddest ADA

08:10.949 --> 08:12.492
in the world.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.535
He's still pissed.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.535
Did Hitchcock and Scully

08:14.577 --> 08:16.204
-get anywhere?

08:14.577 --> 08:16.204
-Hard to say.

08:16.246 --> 08:19.540
Their file contains a lot

08:16.246 --> 08:19.540
of non-case related documents.

08:19.582 --> 08:20.792
A bunch of menus?

08:20.834 --> 08:22.627
A cease and desist letter

08:20.834 --> 08:22.627
from TJ Maxx.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.045
Multiple patent submissions

08:24.087 --> 08:25.546
for something called

08:24.087 --> 08:25.546
a "pillow shoe."

08:25.588 --> 08:27.632
An application

08:25.588 --> 08:27.632
for a time share in "Figi."

08:27.674 --> 08:30.593
-You mean Fiji.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.593
-No, Figi with a G.

08:30.635 --> 08:31.803
They're getting scammed.

08:33.305 --> 08:34.681
Wait.

08:33.305 --> 08:34.681
This is good.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.557
There was a witness

08:34.722 --> 08:36.557
who saw everything.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.810
Identified the thief, they even

08:36.599 --> 08:38.810
described the getaway car down

08:38.852 --> 08:40.645
to a dent in the right bumper.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.645
We're golden.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.856
Yeah, but Hitchcock

08:40.687 --> 08:42.856
and Scully forgot to write down

08:42.897 --> 08:44.483
the witness' name

08:42.897 --> 08:44.483
or contact info.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.027
What?

08:44.524 --> 08:47.027
No, that's insane.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.862
Even they wouldn't

08:47.068 --> 08:48.862
do something that dumb.

08:48.903 --> 08:51.114
Dumb?

08:48.903 --> 08:51.114
Excuse me.

08:51.156 --> 08:52.491
I don't need this crap.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.075
I could be on the beach

08:52.532 --> 08:54.075
in Figi right now.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.952
If we go to court,

08:54.117 --> 08:55.952
we're gonna need

08:55.994 --> 08:57.204
the witness to testify.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.373
But now, we have no way

08:57.245 --> 08:59.373
of contacting him.

08:59.414 --> 09:00.999
So there's no case.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.918
How could you not take down

09:01.041 --> 09:03.918
the witness' contact info?

09:03.960 --> 09:07.506
Well, unlike you dorks,

09:03.960 --> 09:07.506
we don't do everything

09:03.960 --> 09:07.506
"by the book."

09:07.547 --> 09:08.548
We play by our own rules.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.258
-And we get results.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.258
-Mm-hmm.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.551
No! You don't!

09:11.592 --> 09:13.303
That's why we're here!

09:13.345 --> 09:14.762
[Jake] So John McClain's

09:13.345 --> 09:14.762
advice wasn't great,

09:14.804 --> 09:17.015
but I have other books.

09:14.804 --> 09:17.015
This one says

09:17.057 --> 09:19.267
to make sure neither

09:17.057 --> 09:19.267
of you has a full diaper.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.935
Feels like we can skip

09:19.309 --> 09:20.935
that part.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.103
I wouldn't be so sure.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.604
Dad, come on, all right?

09:23.646 --> 09:25.399
How about this?

09:25.440 --> 09:27.401
Dad, just name one happy memory

09:25.440 --> 09:27.401
that you have with Grandpa.

09:27.442 --> 09:30.153
And don't say the memory you're

09:27.442 --> 09:30.153
going to have at his funeral.

09:30.195 --> 09:33.198
All right, when I was eight,

09:30.195 --> 09:33.198
he was on shore leave,

09:33.240 --> 09:37.244
and we played catch

09:33.240 --> 09:37.244
in the yard, and that was fun.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.037
Hey, there you go.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.037
That was great.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.915
And Grandpa, is there a happy

09:39.079 --> 09:41.915
memory you want to share?

09:41.956 --> 09:43.958
Well, can I pick

09:41.956 --> 09:43.958
the catch thing too?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.335
-Yeah, sure.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.335
-'Cause that was really

09:45.377 --> 09:47.295
a nice time.

09:45.377 --> 09:47.295
While we were playing,

09:47.337 --> 09:49.214
the neighbor kid

09:47.337 --> 09:49.214
fell off his bike.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.591
-Yeah, he broke his arm.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.591
-You could see the bone.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.343
[laughs]

09:51.632 --> 09:53.343
Do you remember when we went

09:53.385 --> 09:55.595
skiing, and the guy fell off

09:53.385 --> 09:55.595
the lift and busted his leg?

09:55.636 --> 09:57.514
-And you could see the bone.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.514
-It was just, like,

09:57.556 --> 10:00.350
sticking right out of the skin,

09:57.556 --> 10:00.350
and he's, like, screaming.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.685
-We were laughing.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.685
-Oh, oh, it was beautiful.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.145
God, I hope

10:02.727 --> 10:04.145
somebody found him.

10:04.187 --> 10:06.147
Okay, well, you guys

10:04.187 --> 10:06.147
are both monsters,

10:06.189 --> 10:07.441
but this is going great.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.901
[flute music]

10:09.943 --> 10:11.278
Yes, yes.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.446
I know you're being positive,

10:12.487 --> 10:14.614
but I could use

10:12.487 --> 10:14.614
some honest criticism.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.366
Terry, I'd love

10:14.655 --> 10:16.366
to help, but...

10:18.410 --> 10:19.744
Follow me.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.497
Hello.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.497
[laughs]

10:22.539 --> 10:24.165
You caught me stretching.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.165
I've been doing this

10:24.207 --> 10:26.834
and nothing else for the

10:24.207 --> 10:26.834
last half hour continuously.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.295
[Charles]

10:26.876 --> 10:28.295
I saw you watching Terry.

10:28.336 --> 10:29.879
You were finger conducting.

10:30.964 --> 10:31.923
Fine.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.425
Yes.

10:33.467 --> 10:36.344
I may have overstated

10:33.467 --> 10:36.344
my contempt for the music

10:36.386 --> 10:39.389
they play so that I wouldn't

10:36.386 --> 10:39.389
have to help Jeffords.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.308
Oh, no, am I so bad,

10:39.431 --> 10:41.308
I can't be helped?

10:41.349 --> 10:43.768
Aw, man, I wanted to play

10:41.349 --> 10:43.768
in the Thanksgiving Day Parade.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.520
Terry loves being

10:43.810 --> 10:45.520
in and among floats.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.730
You're not bad.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.730
You're maybe even...

10:47.772 --> 10:49.608
Good.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.608
But to make you great,

10:49.649 --> 10:52.777
I'd have to break you down

10:49.649 --> 10:52.777
to nothing.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.196
-It would ruin our friendship.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.196
-I can handle criticism.

10:55.238 --> 10:56.906
My daughters criticize me

10:55.238 --> 10:56.906
all the time.

10:56.948 --> 10:59.367
They're so mean now.

10:56.948 --> 10:59.367
Please help me, sir, please!

11:00.701 --> 11:03.037
Okay.

11:00.701 --> 11:03.037
Give me your flute.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.831
Wrong!

11:03.079 --> 11:04.831
First rule:

11:04.872 --> 11:09.210
never give anyone your flute.

11:09.252 --> 11:11.630
-Hey, babe, how's it going?

11:09.252 --> 11:11.630
-[Jake]<i> Amazingly well.</i>

11:11.671 --> 11:13.714
My dad and my grandpa are

11:11.671 --> 11:13.714
actually getting along.

11:13.756 --> 11:14.882
They've been

11:13.756 --> 11:14.882
catching up nonstop.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.092
-Aunt Millie?

11:14.924 --> 11:16.092
-Dead.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.344
-Uncle Thomas?

11:16.134 --> 11:17.344
-Dead.

11:17.385 --> 11:18.345
-Aunt Janet?

11:17.385 --> 11:18.345
-Dead.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.471
-Uncle Dean?

11:18.386 --> 11:19.471
-Gay.

11:19.513 --> 11:20.514
Ooh, good for him.

11:20.555 --> 11:22.140
-What about Aunt Lyn?

11:20.555 --> 11:22.140
-Dead.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.100
Apparently there was a fire

11:22.182 --> 11:24.100
at the family reunion.

11:24.142 --> 11:26.436
Lucky for my Uncle Dean, he

11:24.142 --> 11:26.436
was not welcome at the event.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.313
-Wow. Dark.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.313
-Yeah.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.607
<i>Well, I'm glad</i>

11:28.355 --> 11:30.607
<i>everything's working out.</i>

11:30.649 --> 11:32.317
Oh, I got to go.

11:30.649 --> 11:32.317
Love you, bye.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.734
Actually, I got

11:32.359 --> 11:33.734
to go too, so...

11:33.776 --> 11:35.694
[dial tone]

11:35.736 --> 11:38.198
I didn't even think

11:35.736 --> 11:38.198
it was possible to put a cast

11:38.239 --> 11:40.534
on that part of the body.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.534
[laughing]

11:40.575 --> 11:42.327
That was Amy.

11:40.575 --> 11:42.327
I hung up first.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.829
Looks like things are

11:42.369 --> 11:44.829
still going great in here.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.581
Yeah, they sure are.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.581
Hey, Dad, toss me a beer.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.208
Bring the heat.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.750
Whoa!

11:48.249 --> 11:49.750
[scream]

11:49.792 --> 11:50.918
-No, the sex reveal cake!

11:49.792 --> 11:50.918
-Oh.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.128
Nobody look at the floor!

11:52.170 --> 11:53.921
No one can see

11:52.170 --> 11:53.921
the color of the cake.

11:56.341 --> 11:57.716
How long are we doing this?

11:56.341 --> 11:57.716
What's the plan?

11:57.758 --> 11:59.177
I don't know yet!

12:02.138 --> 12:04.765
Okay, we all heard the cake

12:02.138 --> 12:04.765
splat on the other side

12:02.138 --> 12:04.765
of the counter,

12:04.807 --> 12:07.268
which means we can probably

12:04.807 --> 12:07.268
assume you can see the color.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.727
-Why does that matter?

12:07.310 --> 12:08.727
-Because the color of the cake

12:08.769 --> 12:10.647
tells us if we're having

12:08.769 --> 12:10.647
a boy or a girl.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.773
-How can that baker tell?

12:10.689 --> 12:12.773
-Because the baker

12:10.689 --> 12:12.773
does the test.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.609
No, the doctor does the test.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.609
Then the doctor calls the baker,

12:14.651 --> 12:16.027
and the baker makes the cake.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.029
Okay I hate to say this,

12:16.069 --> 12:18.029
but can you start over?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.573
No, we don't have time.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.573
Just help me fix this.

12:19.614 --> 12:20.865
You know, it's Roger's fault.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.492
All he had to do

12:20.907 --> 12:22.492
was catch the beer.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.327
Well, maybe I'd be better

12:22.534 --> 12:24.327
at catch if I played it

12:24.369 --> 12:25.620
more than once growing up.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.038
Guys, focus up.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.415
We're all getting along,

12:27.080 --> 12:28.415
remember?

12:28.456 --> 12:30.458
Now, we can't see

12:28.456 --> 12:30.458
the cake before Amy,

12:30.500 --> 12:31.710
which means we have to

12:30.500 --> 12:31.710
figure out a way

12:31.750 --> 12:32.835
to clean it up without

12:31.750 --> 12:32.835
looking at it.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.753
[gasps]

12:32.877 --> 12:34.753
We have to<i> Birdbox</i> it.

12:34.795 --> 12:37.382
-And Birdbox is the bakery.

12:34.795 --> 12:37.382
-No,<i> Birdbox</i> is a movie

12:37.424 --> 12:39.259
where people aren't allowed

12:37.424 --> 12:39.259
to look at things.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.636
Just put on these blindfolds

12:39.300 --> 12:41.636
and help me clean it up.

12:41.678 --> 12:44.138
I<i> Birdbox-ed</i> a stewardess

12:41.678 --> 12:44.138
in Sweden once.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.139
Dad!

12:45.181 --> 12:46.224
[clock ticking]

12:46.266 --> 12:48.851
Okay, that should be all of it.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.229
I think it's safe

12:48.893 --> 12:51.229
to take off our blindfolds--

12:51.271 --> 12:52.188
Oh, [bleep]!

12:52.230 --> 12:55.149
No, no!

12:52.230 --> 12:55.149
Oh, God!

12:55.191 --> 12:56.317
[bleep]!

12:56.359 --> 12:58.612
What happened?

12:56.359 --> 12:58.612
We were so careful.

12:58.653 --> 13:00.238
Here comes the mop.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.322
Bag.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.322
[grunts]

13:01.364 --> 13:02.657
-This is hard.

13:01.364 --> 13:02.657
-Yeah.

13:02.699 --> 13:05.285
I could use a beer, you know?

13:05.326 --> 13:06.953
-Oh, oh.

13:05.326 --> 13:06.953
-You okay?

13:06.994 --> 13:08.288
The cake was blue.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.373
You're having a boy.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.373
It's the curse.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.375
No. No, no, no,

13:10.415 --> 13:12.375
there's no curse.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.877
Look, we can still fix this.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.877
All we have to do is clean

13:14.919 --> 13:17.297
every inch of this room,

13:14.919 --> 13:17.297
and then bake a gourmet cake.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.257
No one can do all that

13:17.338 --> 13:19.257
in two hours.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.384
Wrong, Dad.

13:21.426 --> 13:22.885
There is one who can.

13:25.346 --> 13:28.475
Hello, fellas.

13:25.346 --> 13:28.475
Let's get to work.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.146
Oh, hey.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.146
I got something.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.939
There was a security camera by

13:33.187 --> 13:34.939
the Carroll Street brownstone.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.357
And it got footage

13:34.981 --> 13:36.357
of the perps?

13:36.399 --> 13:37.776
No, but it caught

13:36.399 --> 13:37.776
Scully and Hitchcock

13:37.816 --> 13:39.360
interviewing the witness.

13:39.402 --> 13:40.654
All right. Let's start

13:39.402 --> 13:40.654
canvassing the neighborhood,

13:40.695 --> 13:41.696
see if anybody

13:40.695 --> 13:41.696
recognizes that guy.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.072
Yeah.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.532
[Scully] Wait!

13:46.075 --> 13:47.744
-What the hell?

13:46.075 --> 13:47.744
-Sorry, I didn't want to run,

13:47.786 --> 13:49.621
and that was the only way

13:47.786 --> 13:49.621
to stop the doors.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.872
-It wasn't, and it didn't.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.872
-It worked, we're here.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.916
Please, don't go looking

13:51.914 --> 13:53.916
for that witness.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.794
We're just trying

13:53.958 --> 13:55.794
to fix your screw-up.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.796
We didn't screw up.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.796
The witness gave us his name,

13:57.836 --> 13:59.922
but he asked us not to write it

13:57.836 --> 13:59.922
down because he's undocumented.

13:59.964 --> 14:03.050
So he's scared to show up

13:59.964 --> 14:03.050
to testify at the courthouse

14:03.092 --> 14:04.552
because he didn't want

14:03.092 --> 14:04.552
to be detained by ICE.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.012
-Damn it.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.012
-You know,

14:06.053 --> 14:07.597
that keeps lots of immigrants

14:06.053 --> 14:07.597
from helping cops.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.307
[Rosa] Yeah, we know that.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.307
We're just surprised

14:09.349 --> 14:10.933
-that you know that.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.933
-That's insulting.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.769
I'm very concerned

14:10.975 --> 14:12.769
with immigration issues.

14:12.811 --> 14:14.688
And I've dated

14:12.811 --> 14:14.688
my fair share of spicy--

14:14.729 --> 14:16.356
-No!

14:14.729 --> 14:16.356
-Scully said the nice thing.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.232
You don't need to

14:16.397 --> 14:18.232
go past it, Hitchcock.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.610
[Charles] Okay, I know you

14:18.274 --> 14:20.610
need help and time is tight,

14:20.652 --> 14:22.445
but I see there is blue cake

14:20.652 --> 14:22.445
on the floor,

14:22.487 --> 14:25.198
and I know what that means,

14:22.487 --> 14:25.198
vis-à-vis the sex of the baby.

14:25.239 --> 14:28.117
So before we do anything,

14:25.239 --> 14:28.117
I'm going to need a minute.

14:29.452 --> 14:31.621
Sorry for all the weeping

14:29.452 --> 14:31.621
and the weird snort noise

14:31.663 --> 14:33.707
I made at the end.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.707
It's genetic.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.667
Now, Jake, grab the mop,

14:33.748 --> 14:35.667
you're on cleanup.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.460
Admiral, you're

14:35.709 --> 14:37.460
making the batter.

14:37.502 --> 14:40.463
-Captain, you're on

14:37.502 --> 14:40.463
frosting duty.

14:37.502 --> 14:40.463
-[clock ticking]

14:40.505 --> 14:42.716
-All right.

14:40.505 --> 14:42.716
-[Jake] Okay, Amy just texted.

14:42.757 --> 14:45.092
She's gonna be here

14:42.757 --> 14:45.092
any second, so hide that thing.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.344
The...

14:47.178 --> 14:48.722
Oh.

14:48.763 --> 14:49.972
Dad, that is so noticeable.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.307
Nuh-uh, it's awesome.

14:51.349 --> 14:52.684
All right, everybody,

14:51.349 --> 14:52.684
act normal.

14:52.726 --> 14:53.852
Act normal.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.603
Hey, guys.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.397
Hey, welcome home.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.982
I'd like you to meet

14:57.438 --> 14:59.982
my grandpa, Walter.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.442
It's so nice to meet you.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.236
Hello, things are

15:01.484 --> 15:03.236
normal here.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.779
[Roger] Yeah, everything's

15:03.277 --> 15:04.779
totally normal.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.364
Back here too,

15:04.821 --> 15:06.364
behind the chair.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.115
[Jake] Yup, and that was

15:06.406 --> 15:08.115
a normal thing to say.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.450
Are things normal

15:08.157 --> 15:09.450
with you, Amy?

15:09.492 --> 15:10.869
-Sure.

15:09.492 --> 15:10.869
-Cool.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.120
I'm going to go get ready

15:10.910 --> 15:13.120
for the party.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.497
Oh, fun.

20:33.691 --> 20:37.153
And you would be a fool

20:33.691 --> 20:37.153
not to put him in your band.

20:37.195 --> 20:39.321
Thank you, Captain.

20:37.195 --> 20:39.321
Lieutenant?

20:39.363 --> 20:40.531
What instrument do you play?

20:40.573 --> 20:41.866
-The flute.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.866
-You're hired.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.576
What?

20:41.908 --> 20:43.576
I haven't even played.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.078
You're the only flute

20:43.617 --> 20:45.078
who auditioned.

20:45.119 --> 20:45.995
Welcome to the band.

20:46.037 --> 20:48.039
Yes!

20:46.037 --> 20:48.039
I did it!

20:49.207 --> 20:50.541
Hey.

20:49.207 --> 20:50.541
How's your dad doing?

20:50.583 --> 20:52.043
Well, the doctor

20:50.583 --> 20:52.043
said he'll be okay,

20:52.085 --> 20:53.836
but his hands are

20:52.085 --> 20:53.836
basically claws now.

20:53.878 --> 20:55.254
I don't know why

20:53.878 --> 20:55.254
they think that's okay.

20:55.295 --> 20:57.464
Hey, listen, I'm sorry

20:55.295 --> 20:57.464
the cake was green.

20:57.506 --> 21:00.051
It's okay. I'll love our

20:57.506 --> 21:00.051
little Shrek no matter what.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.343
Oh, my God. That's right.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.137
You still don't know

21:01.385 --> 21:03.137
the sex of the baby.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.388
With all the craziness,

21:03.179 --> 21:04.388
I almost forgot.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.891
-Emphasis on "almost."

21:04.430 --> 21:06.891
-What?

21:06.933 --> 21:08.642
Well, I got another cake

21:06.933 --> 21:08.642
just for the two of us.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.811
Jake, that's so sweet.

21:10.853 --> 21:12.605
-Here we go.

21:10.853 --> 21:12.605
-I'm so excited.

21:13.814 --> 21:14.899
It's empty.

21:13.814 --> 21:14.899
There's no cake inside.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.275
What?

21:14.941 --> 21:16.275
Where'd it go?

21:16.316 --> 21:18.069
Hey, guys.

21:16.316 --> 21:18.069
Do you have any milk?

21:18.111 --> 21:20.113
[gasps]

21:18.111 --> 21:20.113
We're having a boy?

21:20.154 --> 21:21.614
We're having a boy!

21:21.655 --> 21:23.657
Hey, do you have milk or not?

21:23.699 --> 21:24.992
-Jeez.

21:23.699 --> 21:24.992
-God.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.869
<i>Fremulon.</i>

21:26.911 --> 21:29.205
<i>-Not a doctor.</i>

21:26.911 --> 21:29.205
<i>-Shh!</i>
