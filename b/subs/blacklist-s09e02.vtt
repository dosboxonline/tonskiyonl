00:02.669 --> 00:05.296
Chen Yu-Lan, meet your future patron.

00:06.881 --> 00:08.633
[man] What the hell is this?

00:08.717 --> 00:10.218
This is nuts.

00:10.301 --> 00:11.136
Come here.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.851
This isn't about microchips anymore.

00:17.934 --> 00:19.060
This is kidnapping.

00:19.144 --> 00:22.188
In what stretch of reality
would kidnapping be part of the plan?

00:22.272 --> 00:25.191
The plan failed.
So I came up with a better plan.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.068
SCG segregates each department,

00:27.152 --> 00:30.030
so no one person knows the secret,
how to make its precious chip.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.781
No one except dear Mr. Chen.

00:31.865 --> 00:32.866
Please, help us.

00:32.949 --> 00:34.325
Please, sir. Please.

00:34.409 --> 00:36.619
-Oh, my God. This is insanity.
-Not at all.

00:36.703 --> 00:39.789
SCG makes a critical supply
of the world's most advanced microchip.

00:39.873 --> 00:43.251
-We don't wanna corner the market.
-Cars your employers make aren't running

00:43.334 --> 00:45.295
because they can't acquire enough chips.

00:45.378 --> 00:48.047
I'm offering them an endless supply.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.132
[man] You know what?

00:49.883 --> 00:51.634
We want nothing to do with this.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.219
[Skinner] Good. A state actor, then.

00:53.303 --> 00:56.556
A superpower with the vision
that you clearly lack.

00:57.307 --> 00:58.725
And what about Mr. Chen?

00:58.808 --> 01:00.143
And his family?

01:00.643 --> 01:02.270
-They're no longer your concern.
-[gunshot]

01:02.353 --> 01:03.772
[woman and girl scream]

01:03.855 --> 01:05.273
No!

01:06.149 --> 01:08.860
I think we know the moral to that story.

01:08.943 --> 01:10.570
[woman and girl sobbing]

01:11.321 --> 01:12.614
Do as I say...

01:13.239 --> 01:16.284
so I won't have to do as I do.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.620
[suspenseful music playing]

01:19.204 --> 01:20.121
Understood?

01:22.749 --> 01:24.209
Yes? No?

01:31.049 --> 01:31.966
Plan B.

01:33.593 --> 01:34.969
You're gonna die when you hear it.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.690
[Dembe] It's the only way.

01:47.774 --> 01:50.193
-Then it's not gonna work.
-I can't go in.

01:50.276 --> 01:53.071
-'Cause you're still wounded?
-We don't have a warrant.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.781
I can't enter without one.

01:54.864 --> 01:56.116
You can't, but I can?

01:56.199 --> 01:57.534
I'm an FBI agent.

01:57.617 --> 01:58.576
You're not.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.579
Look, Anderson abducted a family.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.456
Husband, wife, 11-year-old daughter.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.500
We have probable cause to enter his home.

02:05.583 --> 02:08.044
And I will,
as soon as Park gets a warrant.

02:08.128 --> 02:12.340
Otherwise, anything I find that proves
his guilt will get tossed out of court.

02:12.423 --> 02:14.008
Hey, I know the rules of evidence.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.802
But I'm not just gonna sit there waiting.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.096
Then don't.
We're legally on thin ice anyway.

02:18.179 --> 02:20.557
You're arguably acting
as an agent of the bureau.

02:20.640 --> 02:24.144
So you're the good cop
and I'm the bad guy now?

02:25.270 --> 02:28.106
[scoffs] Oh, this just gets better
and better.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.902
[suspenseful music playing]

02:44.622 --> 02:47.458
You said the place was upscale
but not lived in.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.794
Raymond has places like that.

02:49.878 --> 02:50.712
Why?

02:51.379 --> 02:53.172
Because he can.

02:53.256 --> 02:54.424
Because he has resources.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.718
Which means the Skinner does too.

02:57.802 --> 02:59.637
Resources we can't match.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.349
So why'd you become an agent?

03:03.433 --> 03:07.020
Reddington always has some secret agenda.
What's yours?

03:08.980 --> 03:11.983
What you found is that we're outmatched.

03:12.817 --> 03:15.361
That unless we get help,
we'll never find the hostages

03:15.445 --> 03:17.113
or avenge the death of my partner.

03:17.196 --> 03:18.573
Not that you care much.

03:21.117 --> 03:24.120
Third-degree burns
and the biggest pain I've got is you.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.081
[Dembe sighs]

03:28.958 --> 03:30.710
[cell phone dialing]

03:32.378 --> 03:33.421
Yeah, it's me.

03:33.504 --> 03:36.049
Think you need
to reach out to the senator.

03:41.971 --> 03:43.223
Cynthia!

03:44.224 --> 03:46.559
That's Senator Cynthia to you.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.436
To what do I owe the displeasure?

03:48.519 --> 03:50.521
I thought
absence made the heart grow fonder.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.732
I am fond of you when you're absent.

03:52.815 --> 03:55.485
Up close, I vacillate
between fear and loathing.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.737
Your briefing with the secretary
has to wait.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.280
Aren't you a talking head now?

03:59.364 --> 04:01.616
Chitchatting about crime and terrorism

04:01.699 --> 04:05.036
till you're booted for the segment
on how to make the perfect hot wing?

04:05.870 --> 04:07.330
This is important, senator.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.915
I'm sure it is, Harold.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.042
That's what I'm afraid of.

04:12.043 --> 04:15.380
I'm sure you know about
the attempted theft of the SCG microchips.

04:15.463 --> 04:18.883
What you may not know is that Dembe Zuma
is the reason they weren't taken.

04:18.967 --> 04:20.510
I heard he was with the bureau.

04:20.593 --> 04:23.388
I can only imagine what heartstring
you pulled to make that happen.

04:23.471 --> 04:24.681
He's been badly hurt.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.182
His partner killed.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.102
For his troubles, he's been benched
pending an investigation.

04:29.185 --> 04:30.395
So he turned to you.

04:30.478 --> 04:32.272
I got the band back together.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.314
What band?

04:33.398 --> 04:34.440
There is no band.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.942
I disbanded the band.

04:36.025 --> 04:38.027
Voided Reddington's immunity agreement.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.362
He's given us a lead.

04:39.445 --> 04:40.363
A lead on what?

04:40.446 --> 04:44.534
The microchips weren't taken,
but the engineer, Chen Yu-Lan,

04:44.617 --> 04:46.536
who knows how to make them was.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.080
Imagine that information
in the hands of our enemies.

04:49.163 --> 04:53.167
The technology that powers your phone,
your car, the Internet.

04:53.876 --> 04:57.171
Once they have it,
imagine them cutting us off.

04:57.255 --> 05:00.758
I haven't heard about any abduction.
Is anyone claiming responsibility?

05:00.842 --> 05:02.010
Yes.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.137
A 700-year-old pirate.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.973
Does Reddington know
any run-of-the-mill criminals?

05:07.056 --> 05:10.101
The Skinner's the latest
in a long line of brigands,

05:10.184 --> 05:13.521
a nom de guerre passed
from one generation to the next.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.481
The current Skinner is Graeme Anderson.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.984
He abducted the engineer and his family.

05:18.067 --> 05:20.653
We can't solve this case
without your help.

05:25.241 --> 05:28.745
If, hypothetically speaking,

05:29.329 --> 05:31.164
I was to help...

05:32.623 --> 05:34.125
what would you need?

05:41.758 --> 05:43.760
[dramatic music playing]

05:49.474 --> 05:52.310
Panabaker sliced us
a piece of black-ops funding

05:52.393 --> 05:54.687
and a promise
for tactical assistance if needed.

05:54.771 --> 05:57.482
What about access to CODIS
and bureau databases?

05:57.565 --> 06:01.069
They're ours, soon as you
and Agent Park access the system.

06:02.653 --> 06:05.490
[cell phone ringing]

06:06.824 --> 06:07.950
Agent Park?

06:09.535 --> 06:10.578
We're on a clock.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.747
Right. Sorry.

06:21.964 --> 06:23.341
What are you doing?

06:23.424 --> 06:24.842
Perseverating.

06:26.761 --> 06:28.262
About what you said.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.265
About honoring Elizabeth.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.684
I mean, what are you doing here?

06:33.768 --> 06:35.228
In her office?

06:35.311 --> 06:38.272
I believe I already answered
that question, Donald.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.152
You're back.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.320
For the moment.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.155
Let me bring you up to speed.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.407
How about we do that in your office?

06:59.919 --> 07:01.212
Just go slowly.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.089
It'll come.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.091
What'll come?

07:05.174 --> 07:06.425
I don't know.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.594
Whatever it is.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.722
Tomorrow, I suppose.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.945
[Chen] This is just a satellite office.

07:26.028 --> 07:26.863
Please.

07:27.488 --> 07:28.906
Your plan will not work.

07:28.990 --> 07:29.824
It has to work.

07:29.907 --> 07:32.201
I have bidders lined up
for the processing software

07:32.285 --> 07:33.911
and the man who can run it.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.205
You're the man. Get me that software.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.083
The program you want
is only kept in Taiwan.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.793
I'm not an idiot, Mr. Chen.

07:40.877 --> 07:44.255
Computers in that building can access
the SCG mainframe in Taipei.

07:44.338 --> 07:45.339
Am I wrong?

07:45.423 --> 07:46.757
There are security protocols.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.384
Well, you're the CTO.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.053
If anyone can bypass them,
I'm betting you can.

07:51.637 --> 07:52.722
And when I do...

07:53.806 --> 07:55.516
you will let my family go?

07:56.517 --> 07:58.895
Whatever happens to them
is entirely in your hands.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.688
You have until 5.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.692
Oh, and, Mr. Chen,
I have someone on the inside.

08:04.775 --> 08:08.029
Everything you say or do, I'll know.

08:09.113 --> 08:11.115
[suspenseful music playing]

08:16.454 --> 08:17.455
You hungry?

08:18.122 --> 08:19.457
I want an omelet from Tempo.

08:19.540 --> 08:22.376
The fluffy kind that makes you feel
like you're eating a cloud.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.254
Or we could rob a convenience store
or take candy from a baby.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.089
Something to pass the time, hmm?

08:29.759 --> 08:31.427
Chen's got a nice family.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.889
I hope he gets what I need.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.772
[Cooper] We know the Skinner
abducted Chen and his family.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.982
We don't know if anyone hired him.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.859
[Aram] There's nothing
from State or Langley

08:46.943 --> 08:50.571
to suggest the Skinner's working
for Russia, China or North--

08:50.655 --> 08:51.531
Um...

08:52.448 --> 08:54.450
I'm sorry, but what happened to your hair?

08:54.534 --> 08:56.327
Oh. [chuckles]

08:56.410 --> 08:57.703
Straight razor.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.831
Weecha does my face
and my head in one fell swoop.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.043
We don't have enough electricity
where we live

09:04.126 --> 09:08.297
to waste any on clippers
or other electronics.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.133
Just the fridge and the CD player.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.971
But I can tell you,
one of life's great simple pleasures

09:15.054 --> 09:19.016
is seeing a woman, naked, out on the porch
with a bowl of hot water,

09:19.100 --> 09:21.310
shaving her legs with a straight razor.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.436
It's captivating.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.022
[Cooper] Bastards took my Scotch.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.732
[Raymond] I've been drinking a lot of rum.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.985
Slow-aged in the mountains.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.736
Rich and delicious.

09:30.820 --> 09:34.657
We get barrels of the stuff
from Weecha and Mierce's family.

09:34.740 --> 09:38.494
Cool. There's nothing in the bureau's
database about Chen's disappearance.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.496
SCG hasn't reported him missing.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.956
That's all we have.

09:42.039 --> 09:45.585
I know not to ask how you can help us,
but I know you can.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.379
And I hope your being here means you will.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.593
Donald paid me a visit recently.

09:55.052 --> 09:56.679
He reminded me

09:57.680 --> 10:01.976
that Elizabeth only agreed
to take over my affairs because she...

10:04.437 --> 10:07.523
felt duty bound to continue the Blacklist.

10:12.820 --> 10:16.365
That's why she was there that night.

10:20.578 --> 10:21.912
Doing her duty.

10:27.668 --> 10:30.254
I'm not here just to help you, Harold.

10:30.338 --> 10:31.881
I'm here because...

10:32.798 --> 10:34.425
it's what she would want.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.350
I'll bring you a case of that rum.

10:44.018 --> 10:47.188
It's a swift kick to the head
and no headache.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.946
If you want to talk about
what he likes or dislikes--

10:56.030 --> 10:58.157
I know what he likes and dislikes.

11:00.785 --> 11:03.579
Dembe. I'm glad you're feeling better.

11:03.663 --> 11:07.249
Agent Park, congratulations
on your marriage.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.127
Not so much on your recent freelance work.

11:11.253 --> 11:13.297
-How do you know about that?
-I pay attention.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.674
Or pay people to pay attention for me.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.176
Nasty bit of business.

11:17.259 --> 11:20.930
But your Peter seems
like a ray of sunshine.

11:26.685 --> 11:27.520
[Park] <i>I found Chen.</i>

11:27.603 --> 11:29.313
He's here in D.C. at work.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.732
The company has a satellite office
across the river.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.944
Chen showed up for his meetings
like nothing happened.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.946
[Cooper] Aram, Park, get to that office.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.156
If Chen's okay, maybe his family is too.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.618
If they're not and he's pretending,
I wanna know why.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.670
[cell phone dialing]

11:55.381 --> 11:56.632
[ringing]

12:01.512 --> 12:02.430
[in Mandarin] Mr. Chen.

12:02.513 --> 12:05.391
[in Mandarin] I need you to access
my files on my hard drive. Do it now!

12:07.977 --> 12:10.938
Okay. What's going on? What's wrong?

12:11.021 --> 12:12.690
There's a program on the desktop.

12:12.773 --> 12:16.986
<i>The file name is just a series of numbers</i>
<i>ending in 6-3-2-9.</i>

12:17.736 --> 12:19.738
It will put the network
in diagnostic mode,

12:19.822 --> 12:21.824
<i>suspend its tracking capability.</i>

12:21.907 --> 12:23.534
You're overriding the security protocols.

12:24.618 --> 12:27.955
Yes. I need to download
the programming files.

12:28.038 --> 12:32.585
If the network is in diagnostic mode,
the system won't trigger an alarm.

12:33.252 --> 12:37.465
I don't have time to explain.
I'm sorry to involve you.

12:37.548 --> 12:39.550
<i>But there's a man.</i>
<i>He's holding Wei and Shu.</i>

12:39.633 --> 12:43.179
If I don't do as he says,
they will surely be killed.

12:44.513 --> 12:45.347
Yes.

12:45.973 --> 12:47.600
What do you mean, yes?

12:48.100 --> 12:50.644
Pai-Han, what are you saying?
What did you do?

12:51.604 --> 12:53.063
I'm the one who involved you.

12:53.647 --> 12:54.732
What?

12:54.815 --> 12:56.650
You have to do what he wants.

12:57.818 --> 12:59.904
Then for the sake of our families,

12:59.987 --> 13:01.155
run the program.

13:07.411 --> 13:08.913
[Duke] <i>You said you'd take care of it.</i>

13:08.996 --> 13:10.372
I told you where to find him.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.958
I teed him up and you shanked it.

13:14.168 --> 13:16.712
Now you've come to my club
and put me off my game.

13:17.796 --> 13:20.716
I was once struck by lightning
on a golf course.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.010
While playing in Tripoli.

13:23.093 --> 13:24.470
Gaddhafi was dead,

13:24.553 --> 13:29.934
and to honor the small part I played
in his unceremonious demise,

13:30.017 --> 13:32.686
the leader of the NTC invited me

13:32.770 --> 13:36.732
to play a round
on the dictator's private course.

13:36.815 --> 13:39.485
One minute I'm standing on the 12th green,

13:39.568 --> 13:41.695
the next I'm in a desert encampment

13:41.779 --> 13:44.740
with a lovely,
raven-haired freedom fighter

13:44.823 --> 13:47.660
who's administering to my burns

13:47.743 --> 13:50.037
with the touch of a lover's stroke.

13:50.538 --> 13:51.997
I'm not calling him.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.542
This Skinner is your successor.

13:54.625 --> 13:58.629
You hand-picked him
to take over when you retired.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.965
Now he's killed an FBI agent,

14:01.048 --> 14:05.928
abducted the CTO of the world's
largest microchip manufacturer,

14:06.011 --> 14:09.598
and he's threatening to create
an international incident

14:09.682 --> 14:13.936
that will ruin your historic reputation.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.063
Why do you care about our reputation?

14:16.146 --> 14:19.024
Anderson is the 22nd Skinner.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.902
Twenty-two generations of torch-passing.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.779
I couldn't do it once.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.156
I admire what you all have built.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.117
I don't wanna see it ruined.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.452
I'm retired, not senile.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.246
What aren't you telling me?

14:32.830 --> 14:35.165
I'll tell you
after you talk him off the ledge.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.751
I'm the president of my condo association.

14:37.835 --> 14:38.752
Garbage pickup.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.337
Grounds management.

14:40.421 --> 14:44.091
That's what I do now,
argue about yard signs with snowbirds,

14:44.592 --> 14:47.344
not try and talk sense to a lunatic.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.013
The charter, then.

14:49.096 --> 14:51.473
I know you have the power to invoke it.

14:51.557 --> 14:55.102
Even if I wanted to--
And I'm not saying I do because I don't.

14:55.185 --> 14:57.271
--I couldn't do it without my predecessor.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.772
The Captain.

14:58.856 --> 15:02.109
Is it true she had affairs
during the Paris Peace Talks

15:02.192 --> 15:04.653
with both Kissinger and Le Duc Tho?

15:04.737 --> 15:06.780
The charter's never been invoked.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.491
Not once in 700 years.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.912
Then it'll be a bolt out of the blue.

15:12.995 --> 15:16.248
I lived to tell about
my rather gentle lightning strike.

15:16.332 --> 15:19.668
If we do this right,
Anderson won't be so lucky.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.132
No. No, no, no.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.384
-What's wrong?
<i>-There's new software on the network.</i>

15:27.468 --> 15:29.595
Must be because of the robbery
at the port.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.513
It won't execute?

15:31.597 --> 15:34.516
It will, but the alarm will be triggered.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.644
-Then it's impossible.
<i>-No.</i>

15:36.727 --> 15:38.437
You'd be able to download the program.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.397
The alarm would lead here.

15:41.315 --> 15:42.358
To you?

15:42.441 --> 15:43.275
<i>Yes.</i>

15:45.736 --> 15:47.738
[computer beeping]

15:50.532 --> 15:51.367
It's done.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.121
Thank you.

15:56.747 --> 15:57.748
[Park] What am I missing?

15:57.831 --> 16:00.960
Why would the Skinner abduct Chen
only to release him?

16:01.043 --> 16:02.044
Maybe he escaped.

16:02.127 --> 16:05.965
But if he did, why go to work
and not the police?

16:07.633 --> 16:08.509
Check it out.

16:08.592 --> 16:09.426
That's him.

16:11.178 --> 16:12.638
[suspenseful music playing]

16:13.764 --> 16:14.765
[Park] Shoot.

16:19.353 --> 16:21.438
[siren wailing]

16:32.908 --> 16:34.034
[cell phone ringing]

16:36.662 --> 16:38.580
You're not here. We're not doing this.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.000
But, uh, we are.
I'm pretty sure Pete deserves to know.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.378
-Hi, sweetie.
-[Peter] <i>Hey.</i>

16:44.461 --> 16:46.672
<i>Any chance we could talk things over?</i>

16:46.755 --> 16:49.383
I wish.
But I'm in the middle of something.

16:49.466 --> 16:51.719
<i>-The case.</i>
-[Park] Pete, I'm not a field agent.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.762
-I'm doing a friend a favor. One.
<i>-One?</i>

16:53.846 --> 16:55.556
One. And not a risky one.

16:56.640 --> 16:57.850
[Aram] No. No.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.935
[Park] I promise. A walk in the park.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.479
But we'll talk tonight. I have to go.

17:02.563 --> 17:03.856
<i>Okay. Be safe.</i>

17:06.358 --> 17:08.569
Um, okay. Uh, the street. It's down there.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.614
-Oh, Alina! Car! Car!
-[tires screeching]

17:12.698 --> 17:13.574
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

17:16.326 --> 17:17.619
-[horn honks]
-Whoa.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.877
[siren wailing]

17:37.389 --> 17:38.390
[grunts] Oh.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.142
Okay. I'm driving next time.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.143
Seriously.

17:42.686 --> 17:43.520
FBI!

17:43.604 --> 17:45.355
Hands on the wheel. Now.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.277
Just a walk in the park.

17:56.658 --> 18:00.162
You don't know the address.
Can you describe the building--?

18:00.245 --> 18:01.914
[in English] I was blindfolded.

18:01.997 --> 18:04.291
In and out. All I have is a number.

18:04.374 --> 18:06.210
To a burner phone which is untraceable.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.378
Which is why you have to let me go.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.506
So I can call and free my family.

18:10.589 --> 18:14.051
That's it, then. You give him this,
and he lets you and your family go.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.887
My family, yes.

18:18.597 --> 18:19.973
Your family but not you.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.269
That's it, isn't it?

18:26.230 --> 18:28.023
You're trading your life for theirs.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.109
I don't care what happens to me.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.069
My wife and my daughter...

18:33.112 --> 18:34.655
they're all that matter.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.200
Good to see you, Mr. Beauregard.
It's been a while.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.868
Good to see you too, Ernesto.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.579
I've been in California
on trial in the Central District.

18:42.663 --> 18:43.997
Quite the drama.

18:44.081 --> 18:46.583
This client of yours is no stranger
to drama either.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.501
Alberta?

18:47.584 --> 18:49.795
-She's been in a state all morning.
-What's the trouble?

18:51.130 --> 18:52.548
[Alberta] <i>I'll tell you the trouble.</i>

18:52.631 --> 18:55.134
One of these bastards stole my phone!

18:55.217 --> 18:56.135
Your cell phone?

18:56.218 --> 18:57.136
Yeah, that's right.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.263
Look away.

19:00.722 --> 19:01.765
I am not crazy.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.184
I had it right here and now it's gone.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.435
Easy, dear.

19:05.519 --> 19:06.478
How do you feel?

19:06.562 --> 19:10.232
Like beating to death
anybody who asks me how I feel.

19:11.942 --> 19:12.901
Who's this?

19:12.985 --> 19:14.027
[Raymond] Ms. Gilbert.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.320
Or Alberta.

19:15.404 --> 19:16.864
May I call you Alberta?

19:16.947 --> 19:18.031
Thank goodness I caught you.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.074
-Mr. Beauregard?
-Hm?

19:19.158 --> 19:22.327
Margaret Collins, I'm the new director
of Resident Relations.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.371
You look concerned. Not to worry.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.206
Nobody's having relations
with the residents.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.457
[Margaret and Raymond laugh]

19:27.541 --> 19:30.586
If I could just have a word
with you privately?

19:32.004 --> 19:33.046
[Margaret sighs]

19:33.130 --> 19:36.592
I know you said you'd like
to take Alberta out for the afternoon.

19:36.675 --> 19:37.593
Same as always.

19:37.676 --> 19:40.095
Unfortunately, things aren't
quite the same as always.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.723
Sorry to say,
Alberta's had a small setback.

19:42.806 --> 19:43.891
[Duke] What kind?

19:43.974 --> 19:45.142
We're not sure yet.

19:45.225 --> 19:47.311
I can't share medical information,

19:47.394 --> 19:49.021
but as you're her attorney,

19:49.104 --> 19:52.232
I feel comfortable saying
her dementia appears to be progressing.

19:52.316 --> 19:55.694
I'm afraid her nephew Douglas
has left strict instructions

19:55.777 --> 19:58.530
that Alberta is not to leave the grounds
under any circumstances.

19:58.614 --> 20:02.409
He's been trying to reach a specialist
about evaluating her condition--

20:02.492 --> 20:04.161
If-- I'm-- I'm sorry.

20:04.244 --> 20:07.664
Walter Brenneman. Or Dr. Brenneman,
but please, call me Walter.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.000
-Oh, you're a doctor?
-I am.

20:10.083 --> 20:12.044
I couldn't help but overhear.

20:12.127 --> 20:15.589
In fact, I'm the very specialist
you were just referring to.

20:15.672 --> 20:18.800
Uh, Norm here and I
are old golfing buddies,

20:18.884 --> 20:22.804
and he asked if I'd come
and spend some time with Alberta.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.682
I'm a neuroscientist first and foremost.

20:25.766 --> 20:29.895
Normally, of course, I wouldn't be
available to take on new patients.

20:29.978 --> 20:31.438
My research at Mayo--

20:31.521 --> 20:33.357
-The Mayo Clinic?
-Yes.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.983
Well, that is wonderful.

20:35.067 --> 20:35.901
[both chuckle]

20:35.984 --> 20:38.028
So you knew about Alberta's setback?

20:38.111 --> 20:40.113
I did. Uh, Douglas and I spoke.

20:40.197 --> 20:43.450
He sounded distraught.
I promised to pull a few strings.

20:43.533 --> 20:45.452
Let me get Doug on the phone.

20:45.535 --> 20:48.497
Yeah, hi. Norman Beauregard.
Is he available?

20:48.580 --> 20:49.748
Oh, darn.

20:49.831 --> 20:53.335
Yeah. I see.
Well, have him call me right away.

20:54.002 --> 20:56.255
He's in off-site meetings all afternoon.

20:56.338 --> 20:57.256
Ouch.

20:58.006 --> 21:01.009
I could try and come back another day.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.512
Although I'm in Brussels next week
for a conference.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.847
No. We appreciate you taking the time.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.850
I'm sure it will be fine
under Mr. Beauregard's supervision.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.602
And since you spoke with Douglas...

21:10.686 --> 21:12.187
-[Duke] Mm.
-Yes. Wonderful.

21:12.854 --> 21:13.689
Okey-doke.

21:16.817 --> 21:17.985
Where are we going?

21:18.068 --> 21:20.487
I wanna invoke the charter
to remove Anderson.

21:20.570 --> 21:21.905
I can't do that without you.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.657
What's wrong with Anderson?

21:23.740 --> 21:25.284
He's noticeable.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.786
Your legacy survives because it isn't.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.705
Who the hell is this guy?

21:29.788 --> 21:31.707
That's Raymond Reddington.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.292
No.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.127
You.

21:35.919 --> 21:37.004
Come closer.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.341
I'll be damned.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.844
Give me a kiss.

21:43.927 --> 21:45.262
A good one.

21:45.345 --> 21:46.638
We're in a bit of a rush.

21:46.722 --> 21:49.516
You want my help,
it's the cost of doing business.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.228
Open mouth.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.981
We're parked in a fire lane.

21:56.064 --> 21:58.984
No tongue, no invoking the charter.

22:11.705 --> 22:14.207
Let's blow this popsicle stand.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.377
Microchips are like coated wafers.

22:17.461 --> 22:21.048
The idea is to cram on
the microscopic, subatomic features

22:21.131 --> 22:23.633
that are the basis
of the chip's performance.

22:23.717 --> 22:27.137
Now, this software is a guide
for manipulating atoms

22:27.220 --> 22:30.140
one-tenth the size
of a human hair or less.

22:30.223 --> 22:31.516
Chen knows how to operate it.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.811
Meaning the Skinner has
two key ingredients for making the chips.

22:34.895 --> 22:38.356
SCG chips, the most advanced in the world.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.941
So advanced that--

22:40.025 --> 22:42.861
And this is one
of those impossible-but-true factoids.

22:42.944 --> 22:46.156
--no one in Silicon Valley or Zhongguancun

22:46.239 --> 22:48.658
or anywhere else knows how to make them.

22:48.742 --> 22:50.994
So an already vulnerable market,

22:51.078 --> 22:54.081
susceptible to catastrophic disruptions
in the supply chain,

22:54.164 --> 22:57.167
can be controlled
by whoever has Chen and the software.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.503
Which, at the moment, is us.

22:59.586 --> 23:02.464
-We don't control anything.
-We don't, but America could.

23:02.547 --> 23:05.008
Only if we got Chen to cooperate
and give the government

23:05.092 --> 23:06.802
the hard drive that doesn't belong to us.

23:06.885 --> 23:09.262
We're talking about technology
that makes the world go round.

23:09.346 --> 23:11.389
Which is why we shouldn't steal it.

23:11.473 --> 23:13.683
When you and Reddington took things,
it was stealing.

23:13.767 --> 23:16.186
When America does it,
it's manifest destiny.

23:16.269 --> 23:18.855
The only people whose destiny
I'm concerned with now

23:18.939 --> 23:20.357
are Chen's wife and daughter.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.901
Chen was supposed to call the Skinner
when he gets the software.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.362
Then that's what he's going to do.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.991
I have it. The software.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.493
Do you? I wonder.

23:31.576 --> 23:34.955
I can bring it to you.
I need to talk to my wife first.

23:35.038 --> 23:37.415
[Skinner] <i>I haven't heard</i>
<i>from my inside man. Why is that?</i>

23:37.499 --> 23:39.209
[Chen] I just need to talk to Wei.

23:41.503 --> 23:42.379
[Wei grunts]

23:45.340 --> 23:46.216
Yu-Lan?

23:46.299 --> 23:47.300
Wei?

23:48.135 --> 23:50.554
[in Mandarin] Are you okay? Is Shu okay?

23:50.637 --> 23:52.430
Yes. We're both okay.

23:54.432 --> 23:57.519
One hour, 2440 Junior Terrace.

23:58.311 --> 24:00.313
[suspenseful music playing]

24:02.023 --> 24:03.275
[in English] What do we do now?

24:05.068 --> 24:06.444
Get your family back.

24:16.371 --> 24:18.039
I'm not giving him the program?

24:18.123 --> 24:20.208
-Not the real one.
-I have to give it to him!

24:20.292 --> 24:22.711
We can't risk the real one falling
into enemy hands.

24:22.794 --> 24:24.921
And I can't risk him killing my family.

24:25.005 --> 24:28.258
[Aram] Of course not. Which is why
we've only made a few modifications,

24:28.341 --> 24:31.386
imperceptible changes
in millions of lines of code.

24:31.469 --> 24:33.972
Only a handful of experts in the world

24:34.055 --> 24:35.932
would have any clue
it's not the genuine article.

24:36.016 --> 24:37.267
[Park] We know what we're doing.

24:37.350 --> 24:40.187
I know it's hard, but please, trust us.

24:46.651 --> 24:47.861
Tell me again.

24:47.944 --> 24:50.197
The meeting point is likely a pickup.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.283
Wherever they take you,
we will track you with these.

24:53.366 --> 24:56.995
Undetectable, the listening components
are baked into the frame.

24:57.078 --> 24:58.955
We'll be with you the entire time.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.333
And when he releases your family,

25:01.416 --> 25:05.420
the SWAT team will hit the building,
save you and arrest the others.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.089
We have the engineer.

25:08.173 --> 25:10.175
The one who knows
how to make the microchips?

25:10.258 --> 25:12.969
As well as the processing software
he needs to make them?

25:13.053 --> 25:15.597
The proprietary software, yes.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.185
Look around, Harold.

25:21.519 --> 25:22.604
What do you see?

25:23.480 --> 25:28.235
What you see is me, out on a limb,
calling in favors to get you this office,

25:28.318 --> 25:31.529
to put this godforsaken task force
back in business.

25:31.613 --> 25:34.324
What you see is a senator you should thank

25:34.407 --> 25:36.284
while giving me
the program this country needs

25:36.368 --> 25:38.870
to make its own high-end
semiconducting chips

25:38.954 --> 25:42.040
-without relying on a foreign power.
-So we should steal it?

25:42.123 --> 25:44.459
How does that make us
any better than Anderson?

25:44.542 --> 25:46.419
Anderson's a criminal
looking to turn a profit.

25:46.503 --> 25:50.006
We're patriots with an obligation
to safeguard this nation.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.468
-Where is it now?
-I won't answer that.

25:53.551 --> 25:56.263
We're talking international politics,
Harold.

25:56.346 --> 25:58.640
Spycraft, war.

25:58.723 --> 26:01.351
It's more complicated
than right and wrong.

26:02.435 --> 26:03.603
Not to me, it isn't.

26:09.734 --> 26:10.735
[door closes]

26:26.459 --> 26:27.711
[Cooper] Maybe I was wrong.

26:29.004 --> 26:32.424
For reaching out to you in Detroit.
Maybe it's too much, being here.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.635
-If it is--
-It's not.

26:37.304 --> 26:40.390
If it is, we'd all understand.

26:40.932 --> 26:43.226
[dramatic music playing]

26:44.561 --> 26:45.979
It's time to meet.

26:46.688 --> 26:47.814
All right, let's do it.

26:47.897 --> 26:49.149
Look, I'm good.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.026
Then roll out.

26:53.570 --> 26:55.572
[suspenseful music playing]

27:04.956 --> 27:06.207
Show me the drive.

27:26.436 --> 27:29.022
-Hey, Aram, are you seeing this?
-[Aram] <i>All over it.</i>

27:29.105 --> 27:31.524
The building looks like some kind
of shipping warehouse.

27:31.608 --> 27:35.195
Public records show
over 58,000 square feet for the complex,

27:35.278 --> 27:38.656
owned by a shell company
called Goldenshore Industries.

27:38.740 --> 27:41.826
-We can't cover that space with just us.
-[Cooper] <i>Way ahead of you.</i>

27:41.910 --> 27:43.995
SWAT units have been dispatched.

27:44.746 --> 27:46.039
Tell me you got it.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.294
I knew you could do it.

27:52.003 --> 27:54.047
All these guys bet against you.

27:54.130 --> 27:55.715
But me? Total confidence.

27:55.799 --> 27:56.883
That's Anderson.

27:56.966 --> 28:00.303
We sit tight until he releases
Chen's wife and daughter.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.097
My family, where are they?

28:02.180 --> 28:04.557
Comfortable. Having sodas
and snacks down the hall.

28:04.641 --> 28:06.267
You said you'd let them go.

28:06.351 --> 28:09.521
That's not what I said.
You're forgetting an "if."

28:09.604 --> 28:12.524
I said I'd let them go
if you did what I asked.

28:12.607 --> 28:13.983
I got you the program.

28:14.067 --> 28:16.903
I know you say you got me the program,
but how would I know?

28:16.986 --> 28:20.573
I'm a sharp guy, but I don't know
a damn thing about code.

28:20.657 --> 28:22.826
Which is why I went
and kidnapped an expert.

28:22.909 --> 28:25.787
We're fine. There are maybe
five people who have the skill

28:25.870 --> 28:27.789
to assess that code in under three days.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.166
This is Mr. Sato Akimasa,

28:30.250 --> 28:32.127
<i>professor of information technology.</i>

28:32.210 --> 28:33.336
And he's one of them.

28:40.009 --> 28:42.512
[Skinner] You okay, Mr. Chen?
You don't look so good.

28:42.595 --> 28:44.889
He's cracking. He won't hold up.

28:47.058 --> 28:48.351
It wasn't my idea.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.854
<i>I wanted to give you the program,</i>
<i>but they refused.</i>

28:51.479 --> 28:53.648
What wasn't your idea? Who refused?

28:55.191 --> 28:56.067
The FBI.

28:56.693 --> 28:57.819
<i>They're outside now.</i>

28:59.529 --> 29:01.156
They're listening.

29:04.617 --> 29:05.744
We're going in.

29:10.039 --> 29:12.333
There's only three of them.
They can't go in blind.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.419
We don't know how many of them
they're up against.

29:20.258 --> 29:22.260
[suspenseful music playing]

29:24.971 --> 29:28.892
-This place is massive. Where are they?
-We'll need some help here.

29:28.975 --> 29:32.353
Working on it. I'm trying to access
any blueprints on file with the city.

29:32.437 --> 29:35.982
-Chen's family may not have time.
-Dembe took the east side of the building.

29:36.065 --> 29:38.067
We can't stay here.
We have to keep moving.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.320
What did you do?

29:40.403 --> 29:43.615
-I warned you what would happen--
-No. I didn't go to them!

29:51.831 --> 29:53.208
[Skinner] Bring them out. Let's go.

29:53.291 --> 29:55.126
Apparently, we have company!

29:55.210 --> 29:58.046
-I hear Anderson, southeast corner.
-[Skinner] Time to greet our guests!

29:58.129 --> 29:59.130
[Ressler] On our way.

30:00.006 --> 30:02.550
Olly olly oxen free!

30:05.512 --> 30:07.347
Nobody wants to play?

30:10.391 --> 30:13.603
Well, perhaps I can provide
motivation to participate.

30:13.686 --> 30:15.396
[screams]

30:15.480 --> 30:17.232
Who's firing? Report.

30:17.315 --> 30:19.025
He just shot Chen's wife in the leg.

30:19.108 --> 30:20.819
Mama! Mama!

30:20.902 --> 30:22.779
[sobbing] Mama. Mama.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.740
I can't kill Chen.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.700
He's the golden goose.

30:28.243 --> 30:31.204
But the others are entirely up for grabs.

30:32.747 --> 30:34.415
Show yourselves.

30:37.544 --> 30:39.462
Show yourselves!

30:40.296 --> 30:42.590
-I believe he'll kill them.
-So do I.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.217
Cooper, how do you wanna play this?

30:44.926 --> 30:46.761
Don't give up your weapons.
Hold your position.

30:47.887 --> 30:49.347
Still no takers?

30:49.430 --> 30:51.015
Come out!

30:51.099 --> 30:53.017
I told him you're here!

30:53.101 --> 30:54.644
Agent Zuma!

30:55.186 --> 30:56.604
[Skinner] Agent Zuma?

30:56.688 --> 30:58.356
Well, look at that.

30:59.107 --> 31:00.400
You found me.

31:01.985 --> 31:04.487
I'd say I'm about to find you.

31:04.571 --> 31:07.657
-[Chen] No! No!
-The next one...

31:08.283 --> 31:09.409
goes in the girl.

31:09.492 --> 31:10.493
He'll kill her.

31:10.577 --> 31:12.620
Ressler, stay where you are.

31:13.955 --> 31:15.373
Please.

31:15.456 --> 31:17.500
-[gunshots]
-[Shu whimpers]

31:18.751 --> 31:19.878
Please.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.172
All right, all right. Coming out.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.924
All right, just hold your fire.

31:28.511 --> 31:29.846
That's one.

31:31.639 --> 31:35.101
Agent Zuma, you and whoever's with you

31:35.184 --> 31:38.813
have three seconds
before things end badly.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.440
-[Chen] No.
-[Shu crying] No.

31:41.149 --> 31:42.734
No, please, please.

31:42.817 --> 31:44.402
Please!

31:44.485 --> 31:47.405
Sorry, Harold.
The only move now is to buy time.

31:47.488 --> 31:49.407
<i>Get backup here as soon as you can.</i>

31:50.033 --> 31:52.243
[Shu crying] Please. Please, no.

31:52.327 --> 31:53.369
No.

31:57.290 --> 31:58.583
Please. No.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.461
[suspenseful music playing]

32:02.420 --> 32:05.757
-I warned you not to pursue this.
-FBI SWAT's on their way.

32:05.840 --> 32:08.176
Thanks for the heads-up.
I'll be sure to kill you quickly.

32:08.259 --> 32:11.262
That won't change anything.
The bureau knows who you are.

32:11.346 --> 32:14.515
I'll take my chances.
Take Chen and the family out of here.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.309
-I'll deal with them later.
-[Shu] No.

32:16.392 --> 32:18.311
Sir, we've got a situation
at the front entrance.

32:18.394 --> 32:20.521
-Hold them off.
-It's not the FBI.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.273
[Raymond] Mr. Anderson.

32:23.983 --> 32:25.318
What the hell is this?

32:25.944 --> 32:26.778
We haven't met.

32:26.861 --> 32:30.490
You're familiar, of course,
with Vincent Duke and the Captain.

32:32.367 --> 32:33.785
You're Raymond Reddington.

32:33.868 --> 32:36.579
Imagine, the three of you in one room.

32:36.663 --> 32:39.749
Somebody get a cat,
let's see how many Skinners it takes to--

32:39.832 --> 32:42.085
Not in the mood for jokes? Fair enough.

32:42.168 --> 32:45.004
It has been a long day all around.

32:45.088 --> 32:47.590
What are you doing here?
How'd you find me?

32:47.674 --> 32:49.258
We issued a Code Red,

32:49.342 --> 32:51.302
which, if you'd bothered
to read the bylaws,

32:51.386 --> 32:55.264
gives former Skinners access to when,
where and what their successor is doing.

32:55.348 --> 32:58.518
Or, in this case, doing badly.

32:58.601 --> 33:00.520
I don't mind ruthless.

33:00.603 --> 33:03.356
In fact, I'm quite aroused by it.

33:03.439 --> 33:06.567
It's stupidity
that dries me like the Sahara.

33:06.651 --> 33:10.363
And killing a federal agent,
then snatching an innocent family,

33:10.446 --> 33:12.365
that's about as stupid as you can get.

33:12.448 --> 33:15.243
I already told you,
it's not your brand anymore.

33:15.326 --> 33:18.204
Unfortunately for you,
it's not yours either.

33:19.038 --> 33:20.581
What are you talking about?

33:20.665 --> 33:22.250
[Raymond] You're a caretaker.

33:22.333 --> 33:23.501
A steward.

33:23.584 --> 33:26.546
A trustee in a long line of trustees.

33:26.629 --> 33:28.631
And if you violate that trust,

33:28.715 --> 33:32.343
there is a charter
that details how you can be removed.

33:32.427 --> 33:36.097
[Duke] By us. If two former leaders vote
to remove the current Skinner,

33:36.180 --> 33:37.932
he's out, effective immediately.

33:39.183 --> 33:40.727
You can't be serious.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.937
-I vote you out.
-I agree. Out you go.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.064
This isn't student government.
You can't remove me

33:45.148 --> 33:47.859
because I decided not to serve
ice cream in the cafeteria.

33:47.942 --> 33:49.318
You didn't serve ice cream?

33:49.402 --> 33:51.988
Oh, my gosh, if they'd known.
Forget about it.

33:52.071 --> 33:54.657
Shoot them. Shoot them all.

33:57.577 --> 34:00.288
Did you hear me? That was an order.

34:00.371 --> 34:01.289
Sir...

34:02.123 --> 34:03.791
Fine. I'll do it myself.

34:06.836 --> 34:08.212
Sir, drop your weapon.

34:09.297 --> 34:10.465
Or I will fire.

34:10.548 --> 34:12.175
What are you talking about?

34:12.675 --> 34:14.302
You're listening to them?

34:14.385 --> 34:16.387
-You work for me.
-[man] No.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.389
We work for the organization.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.224
The organization has rules.

34:20.308 --> 34:21.809
We follow them.

34:22.351 --> 34:23.644
And so do they.

34:24.520 --> 34:25.438
[Skinner] Yeah?

34:27.356 --> 34:29.442
Sometimes, rules are meant to be--

34:32.320 --> 34:34.781
We should go before the cavalry arrives.

34:34.864 --> 34:37.283
Make sure the family's safe.
Once we're gone, let everyone go.

34:37.366 --> 34:39.035
It's good to have you back, sir.

34:39.535 --> 34:41.412
Once he was "off the ledge,"

34:41.496 --> 34:44.373
you said you'd explain
your interest in our organization.

34:44.457 --> 34:46.417
So explain it.

34:46.501 --> 34:48.127
The line of succession.

34:48.711 --> 34:51.881
I hadn't thought about it coming
back to me, taking over again.

34:51.964 --> 34:54.342
I can't think
of anything that sounds worse.

34:54.425 --> 34:57.303
Like meeting the First Lady
after you've slept with the president.

34:57.386 --> 34:58.346
Ha.

34:58.429 --> 35:00.515
Do you want to run things, Vincent?

35:00.598 --> 35:03.226
The only thing I want to run
is my condo association.

35:03.309 --> 35:05.728
In that case, I have a suggestion.

35:05.812 --> 35:09.315
Ah, that's it.
You want to pick my successor.

35:09.398 --> 35:11.818
The Skinners are legendary.

35:12.318 --> 35:14.195
With the right person in charge,

35:14.278 --> 35:17.657
I don't think there's a limit
to their reach and power.

35:18.157 --> 35:22.537
As luck would have it, I think I know
who the right person would be.

35:29.085 --> 35:30.962
You did what you came for.

35:33.256 --> 35:35.466
There is nothing here but heartbreak.

35:35.550 --> 35:37.343
I don't believe that.

35:38.928 --> 35:40.763
I can't believe it.

35:43.224 --> 35:44.100
One more stop.

35:44.183 --> 35:47.103
If I don't get the answer
I'm looking for, we'll go.

36:02.994 --> 36:03.995
[gasps]

36:05.413 --> 36:07.123
What are you doing here?

36:07.206 --> 36:09.917
Thinking about that beautiful,

36:10.001 --> 36:14.463
sad Wyeth painting
you have in the next room.

36:15.214 --> 36:17.884
I didn't know you were so melancholy.

36:17.967 --> 36:23.598
With all your little colloquialisms
and snappy repartee.

36:23.681 --> 36:26.475
-What do you want?
-Something you can't give me.

36:26.976 --> 36:30.188
But which I can't get without your help.

36:30.938 --> 36:32.982
So I thought, perhaps,

36:33.816 --> 36:35.443
we might help each other.

36:39.655 --> 36:41.657
We're relieved you
and your family are safe.

36:41.741 --> 36:44.243
And Kuo Pai-Han, my associate in Taiwan?

36:44.327 --> 36:47.830
We spoke to the authorities in Taipei.
He's being released.

36:47.914 --> 36:49.749
Both he and his family will be fine.

36:51.626 --> 36:53.502
I believe this belongs to you.

36:54.337 --> 36:55.796
You're giving it back?

36:56.380 --> 36:58.674
Your government doesn't insist
on keeping it?

36:58.758 --> 36:59.717
Oh, they do.

36:59.800 --> 37:03.012
But our objective was to prevent it
from falling into the wrong hands.

37:03.095 --> 37:04.347
Including ours.

37:07.016 --> 37:08.059
Thank you.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.270
Your daughter's with your wife
at the hospital.

37:11.354 --> 37:13.105
Agents are waiting to take you there.

37:17.235 --> 37:20.154
-Okay, that was so fun.
-Which part?

37:20.238 --> 37:22.198
Rescuing Chen and nearly dying,

37:22.281 --> 37:26.285
or driving down a one-way street
into oncoming traffic and nearly dying?

37:26.369 --> 37:28.037
It was purposeful.

37:28.871 --> 37:31.874
We... did something.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.167
Something good.

37:33.793 --> 37:35.461
That's what's cool about it.

37:36.963 --> 37:39.882
-You really miss it, don't you?
-Don't you?

37:40.508 --> 37:42.468
I was positive I didn't.

37:42.551 --> 37:43.844
And now...

37:46.889 --> 37:48.224
I'm not so sure.

37:48.307 --> 37:52.728
Pete would kill me if he heard me say it,
but I wish we were back full-time.

37:53.896 --> 37:56.857
Everyone, you did a good job.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.025
More than that...

37:59.193 --> 38:01.070
you reminded me of all the good we did.

38:01.696 --> 38:04.323
I don't know about you, but I needed that.

38:04.949 --> 38:07.910
I never got to see
the task force from the inside.

38:08.953 --> 38:11.706
Thank you for doing this.

38:12.206 --> 38:14.041
For my partner and for me.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.584
[elevator door opens]

38:20.673 --> 38:21.924
[Raymond] Good Lord!

38:22.008 --> 38:24.260
If this is how you look in victory,

38:24.343 --> 38:26.971
I'd hate to see
what you look like in defeat.

38:27.054 --> 38:28.597
You said you were going.

38:28.681 --> 38:32.727
I also promised to bring Harold
a case of Weecha's hooch.

38:34.478 --> 38:36.772
You could drink me
under the table, couldn't you?

38:36.856 --> 38:38.733
[Raymond] Harold, if I might have a word?

38:38.816 --> 38:42.737
Oh, by the way, my immunity deal
has been reinstated.

38:42.820 --> 38:43.946
What? By who?

38:44.030 --> 38:47.908
Senator Panabaker agreed
to wave her magic wand.

38:47.992 --> 38:51.495
She's offering
to reconstitute the task force

38:51.579 --> 38:56.751
and to let Harold, Donald
and Aram return to the FBI fold.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.711
Why would she wanna do that?

38:58.794 --> 39:01.505
I imagine she likes the work we do.

39:01.589 --> 39:03.466
Do or did?

39:04.050 --> 39:06.302
Mmm, both. And if you do as well,

39:06.385 --> 39:09.388
you're welcome to hop back
on the merry-go-round.

39:09.472 --> 39:11.891
If not, à bientôt.

39:11.974 --> 39:12.975
Harold?

39:14.477 --> 39:16.812
Did he just say what I think he just said?

39:17.688 --> 39:19.940
I don't know. What's "à bientôt" mean?

39:21.317 --> 39:22.401
See you soon.

39:22.943 --> 39:25.988

One of them, anyway.
