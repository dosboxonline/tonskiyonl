WEBVTT

00:20.166 --> 00:25.208
BURNING BETRAYAL

01:27.333 --> 01:30.000
BASED ON THE NOVEL BY SUE HECKER

02:44.125 --> 02:46.166
BABI AND CAIO ARE GETTING MARRIED

02:49.916 --> 02:51.041
CALLING

02:56.916 --> 02:58.958
HEY, I MISS YOU

03:08.833 --> 03:09.750
- My love!
- Oh!

03:10.791 --> 03:13.416
You scared me! Are you trying to kill me?

03:13.500 --> 03:14.916
No, I don't want to kill you.

03:15.416 --> 03:17.541
- Aren't you supposed to be in Rio?
- Yes.

03:17.625 --> 03:21.708
I just came for a quick trip.
I have to testify in a client's case.

03:22.583 --> 03:23.833
- Testify?
- Uh-huh.

03:23.916 --> 03:25.666
Why? Are they suing you?

03:25.750 --> 03:29.000
The Public Prosecutor's Office
is investigating them. Money laundering.

03:29.750 --> 03:31.791
- And what do you have to do with it?
- Nothing.

03:31.875 --> 03:34.125
It's common for them to call
all business partners

03:34.208 --> 03:37.333
to testify in this kind of accusation.
It's just protocol.

03:37.833 --> 03:41.041
Thiago already has all the accounts
and financial statements. All good.

03:41.625 --> 03:46.166
By the way, your partner is the most
intelligent and organized guy I know.

03:46.250 --> 03:47.333
Is he?

03:48.666 --> 03:49.666
Fine.

03:50.333 --> 03:52.958
The second most intelligent
and organized person

03:53.041 --> 03:55.416
that I know, after you,
obviously, my love.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.583
That's better.

03:58.041 --> 03:59.750
But hey, close your eyes.

04:00.458 --> 04:01.541
I have a surprise.

04:01.625 --> 04:03.500
- Trust me.
- Caio…

04:05.708 --> 04:06.708
Open them.

04:08.416 --> 04:11.000
That's beautiful, honey! I love it!

04:15.083 --> 04:16.458
Put them on so I can see.

04:16.541 --> 04:18.875
Hold on. Let's see.

04:21.166 --> 04:22.000
So?

04:23.583 --> 04:25.583
- Do you like them?
- Stunning.

04:25.666 --> 04:26.875
Stunning.

05:03.208 --> 05:04.125
I'm gonna come.

05:05.125 --> 05:06.875
- Okay.
- I'm gonna come, baby.

05:10.125 --> 05:11.166
Oh, baby…

05:15.666 --> 05:16.750
Oh, that was good.

05:18.875 --> 05:19.958
What's that face?

05:21.333 --> 05:22.250
It wasn't good?

05:23.250 --> 05:26.041
- Of course, it was. It's not that.
- What is it then?

05:28.125 --> 05:30.416
I was thinking about the motorcycle.

05:31.875 --> 05:32.750
Motorcycle?

05:33.833 --> 05:36.791
Yeah, I got an offer from a buyer.
Did I tell you?

05:37.708 --> 05:40.000
Finally, right, baby?
It's good to hear that.

05:40.666 --> 05:43.416
Especially since you have
so much to do for the wedding,

05:43.500 --> 05:45.250
and that motorcycle is time-consuming.

05:45.750 --> 05:49.041
How was your week?
The planning, has it been a lot of work?

05:49.875 --> 05:54.291
There are still some of the decorations
to sort out. But it's going to be fine.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.250
I'm really happy
with the life we're building.

06:01.208 --> 06:02.041
Me too.

06:03.000 --> 06:03.833
I love you.

06:06.541 --> 06:07.583
- Are you hungry?
- I am.

06:07.666 --> 06:10.458
- I'll make some pasta for us.
- How enthusiastic!

06:10.541 --> 06:12.416
Pasta, a little wine.

06:13.250 --> 06:14.583
Marvelous.

06:23.125 --> 06:26.666
No, girl, you don't understand.
It wasn't one of those crazy dreams

06:26.750 --> 06:28.708
where you're in the bathroom,
open the door,

06:28.791 --> 06:31.041
and it's both the office
and your grandma's house.

06:31.125 --> 06:33.250
This dream was real. Very real.

06:33.333 --> 06:35.833
Hey, listen to this.
"Dreaming that you're cheating

06:35.916 --> 06:38.541
doesn't really mean
you want to cheat on your partner."

06:38.625 --> 06:39.625
See?

06:39.708 --> 06:43.833
"It is likely that you are cheating
on yourself by making choices

06:43.916 --> 06:46.458
that you sense are wrong."

06:46.541 --> 06:49.166
I don't know, girl.
Think about what it could mean.

06:50.208 --> 06:52.750
For example,
do you really want to get married?

06:52.833 --> 06:55.000
I love Caio.
Why wouldn't I want to get married?

06:55.083 --> 06:57.416
I dunno, you've slept
with few people before Caio.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.333
It could be repressed desire.

07:00.833 --> 07:03.750
I'd die of boredom having sex
with the same person my whole life.

07:04.250 --> 07:05.750
We are definitely very different.

07:05.833 --> 07:08.375
I don't know how you can trust
guys from dating apps.

07:08.458 --> 07:10.875
Girl, what is riskier and more dangerous

07:10.958 --> 07:13.166
than sharing your whole life with someone?

07:13.958 --> 07:15.083
Thank you.

07:15.166 --> 07:16.708
- A little more, please.
- Come here.

07:17.250 --> 07:20.750
Can I download something on your phone?
A great app.

07:20.833 --> 07:21.833
Thanks.

07:23.333 --> 07:27.041
This way I'll always know where you are
and if you're safe.

07:27.125 --> 07:29.250
Fine. But if you wanna know where I go,

07:29.333 --> 07:31.083
I wanna know where you go too,

07:31.166 --> 07:34.541
'cause if one day the app shows me
you're at a swinger's club,

07:34.625 --> 07:36.083
I'll know your dream came true.

07:36.875 --> 07:40.416
I'm going to have to let the seams out.
There's no other way.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.333
No. You don't have to.

07:42.416 --> 07:44.458
By the wedding day, I'll fit.

08:01.708 --> 08:02.708
Excuse me.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.000
- Coffee?
- Oh!

08:05.625 --> 08:06.458
Thanks.

08:07.416 --> 08:09.083
- Do you need anything?
- No.

08:09.833 --> 08:12.583
No, I'm looking over
the transactions between Caio's business

08:12.666 --> 08:15.791
and the construction company.
I want to go to the hearing.

08:15.875 --> 08:17.041
Nonsense, Babi.

08:17.666 --> 08:21.083
It's just a preliminary hearing.
I have everything sorted and organized.

08:21.166 --> 08:25.125
I know, but I'm a business partner, right?
It's my obligation too.

08:25.208 --> 08:26.875
Don't say I didn't warn you.

08:27.375 --> 08:29.958
- It's going to be extremely boring.
- I know.

08:33.166 --> 08:34.791
Oh, look, Thiago.

08:35.625 --> 08:37.833
It looks just like my bike.

08:37.916 --> 08:40.250
It breaks my heart a little to sell it.

08:41.666 --> 08:43.000
Don't sell it then.

08:43.083 --> 08:46.666
It's part of a different phase.
It doesn't fit into my life anymore.

08:46.750 --> 08:48.416
Especially since I want to have kids.

08:50.166 --> 08:52.416
We're late, Babi. Let's get going?

08:52.500 --> 08:53.375
Let's go.

08:54.333 --> 08:57.250
ROAD HARPIES MOTORCYCLE CLUB

09:07.750 --> 09:09.500
- Where's Caio?
- He's late.

09:51.166 --> 09:52.041
I've arrived.

09:56.041 --> 09:57.541
Sorry, there was traffic.

09:59.125 --> 10:00.916
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.541
My name is Marco Ladeia,
and I am the judge of this court.

10:05.500 --> 10:09.125
Let's begin this preliminary hearing.

10:10.041 --> 10:12.000
Mr. Caio Siqueira, please.

10:14.750 --> 10:17.708
Can you please describe in detail

10:17.791 --> 10:23.083
the relationship of your import company
with Melagold Construction,

10:23.166 --> 10:26.208
which is being accused
of irregular financial operations,

10:26.791 --> 10:30.958
forming a criminal organization,
and money laundering for a drug cartel?

10:32.875 --> 10:36.708
Well, my relationship with the company
started in 2009,

10:37.291 --> 10:40.125
and since then
we have always maintained transparency.

10:41.125 --> 10:43.875
My accountant, Thiago,
has brought all the balance sheets

10:43.958 --> 10:46.333
and accounts to present to Your Honor.

10:47.791 --> 10:49.875
…and for this reason,
I, as Caio's accountant,

10:49.958 --> 10:52.750
can guarantee that there is
no connection between my client

10:52.833 --> 10:54.791
and the illegal activities mentioned here.

10:55.791 --> 10:57.333
That's all for the moment.

10:57.416 --> 11:00.666
We are adjourned,
and everyone is dismissed.

11:05.541 --> 11:06.541
I told you.

11:11.625 --> 11:12.583
Let's get going?

11:19.958 --> 11:23.000
Honey,
I need to hurry to the airport now.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.750
I have a meeting in Rio. Okay?

11:24.833 --> 11:26.208
- Already?
- Already.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.666
- I love you. Take care of her.
- Leave it to me.

11:37.916 --> 11:38.916
New car?

11:41.708 --> 11:43.125
I also think it's excessive.

11:43.958 --> 11:47.083
Hey, do you want to join me
for my bachelorette party?

11:47.166 --> 11:49.333
But isn't that a thing
just for the ladies?

11:49.416 --> 11:51.916
But you're my best friend.
You have privileges.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.666
I see. Thanks, but I think it's better
if you enjoy it with your girlfriends.

11:56.250 --> 11:59.166
- Wanna stop somewhere for lunch?
- I can't.

11:59.916 --> 12:01.583
I have to say goodbye to a friend.

12:20.291 --> 12:22.333
- Hi. Are you Camille?
- Hi. Yes.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.666
- Take care of her, okay?
- Sure thing.

12:52.416 --> 12:54.458
Take it off!

12:54.541 --> 12:55.500
Take it off!

12:59.291 --> 13:00.458
BRIDE-TO-BE

13:11.250 --> 13:13.208
Handsome! Gorgeous!

13:14.541 --> 13:15.750
What is that?

13:21.125 --> 13:23.166
Surprise!

13:23.250 --> 13:27.541
Your bachelorette party gift is here.

13:28.791 --> 13:31.916
- Girl, you're crazy!
- It's paid for! Take him to the motel.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.541
Of course not. I can't!

13:33.625 --> 13:36.708
Stop being silly.
Caio will never know! Enjoy it!

13:37.375 --> 13:40.500
No, I can't. You use the voucher!
You'll use it better than me.

13:40.583 --> 13:41.416
Me? Are you sure?

13:41.500 --> 13:43.875
- Before I regret it. Go!
- I'm going!

13:43.958 --> 13:45.750
I'll be back in a flash. Let's go!

13:45.833 --> 13:48.708
Come with me! Handsome, hot, gorgeous!

13:48.791 --> 13:50.416
Get it!

13:57.541 --> 13:59.333
Oh my God.

13:59.416 --> 14:01.791
Let's start. This one is from you, right?

14:02.291 --> 14:03.291
Show us!

14:05.416 --> 14:08.250
- A clit-sucker.
- My God!

14:08.333 --> 14:11.375
After two years of marriage,
it's gonna be more useful than Caio.

14:11.958 --> 14:12.791
Thank you.

14:13.708 --> 14:16.416
- I think I've opened everything.
- No, you still have this one.

14:16.500 --> 14:17.333
Hold on.

14:17.416 --> 14:19.041
- From whom?
- Let me see!

14:19.125 --> 14:22.541
"To Babi, a little surprise
from a secret admirer."

14:24.625 --> 14:27.000
Open it!

14:27.083 --> 14:28.458
Open it!

14:28.541 --> 14:30.833
- Open it!
- Oh my God.

14:31.916 --> 14:33.041
How mysterious.

14:40.875 --> 14:41.708
Babi?

15:12.750 --> 15:14.458
- Wow!
- Is it Caio?

15:14.541 --> 15:16.333
- Another woman.
- Caio with someone else?

15:16.416 --> 15:17.250
Babi?

15:19.708 --> 15:21.125
Caio with someone else!

15:24.333 --> 15:25.166
Babi?

15:26.083 --> 15:28.333
Open it, girl. You can come out now.

15:29.083 --> 15:30.791
- No.
- Everyone's already left.

15:32.541 --> 15:34.250
I'm never coming out of here.

15:34.916 --> 15:37.750
Please, Babi!
Oh, thank goodness you arrived.

15:37.833 --> 15:40.583
I've tried everything,
but she won't come out!

15:40.666 --> 15:41.833
I can hear you!

15:42.958 --> 15:43.958
Oh my God.

15:45.166 --> 15:47.041
Hi, Babi. It's me, Thiago.

15:47.125 --> 15:48.458
Open the door, please.

15:48.958 --> 15:50.208
Why should I open it?

15:50.750 --> 15:53.708
To look at people's faces
and say there's no more wedding?

15:54.208 --> 15:56.750
That the guy I love doesn't even exist
and it's a lie?

15:56.833 --> 15:58.625
I'm never coming out of here.

15:58.708 --> 15:59.750
Come on, Babi.

15:59.833 --> 16:02.958
A lot of people out here love you
and want to see you well.

16:04.125 --> 16:06.750
Why did he do that to me, Thiago?

16:06.833 --> 16:08.541
Honestly, I don't know, Babi.

16:09.541 --> 16:11.625
But I'm so, so sorry, really.

16:12.625 --> 16:16.208
I swear I'll do whatever you want.
You can ask me anything.

16:30.291 --> 16:31.916
There's a place I want to go.

16:37.625 --> 16:41.375
I don't think this is a good idea.
Why would you hurt yourself more?

16:41.458 --> 16:44.125
Stop being a wimp, Thiago.
It is a good idea.

16:44.625 --> 16:46.416
If Babi wants this, we'll work it out.

16:46.500 --> 16:49.666
I need to know who this woman is, Thiago.
I need to know everything.

16:50.250 --> 16:52.666
What's her name?
How long have they been together?

16:52.750 --> 16:55.208
- How long have I been cheated on?
- Okay.

16:56.291 --> 16:57.125
So, let's go.

17:00.875 --> 17:04.333
- Good evening, Júnior.
- Good evening, Mr. Thiago. Can I help you?

17:04.916 --> 17:07.458
You remember Babi, right? Caio's fiancée.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.250
So, we need to go to his office.

17:10.333 --> 17:14.583
Actually, she needs to go there
to pick up something he forgot.

17:15.166 --> 17:18.083
If you could let us in,
that would be great.

17:19.250 --> 17:22.541
Unfortunately,
without Mr. Caio's authorization,

17:22.625 --> 17:23.708
it's not possible.

17:23.791 --> 17:27.125
- I understand. That's what I told you.
- You know what?

17:27.750 --> 17:30.375
Since their wedding is coming up
and he's traveling,

17:30.958 --> 17:33.458
she wants to leave a surprise gift
for when he returns.

17:33.541 --> 17:36.375
You wouldn't spoil
a kind gesture like hers, would you?

17:36.458 --> 17:38.875
The world needs more romance.

17:39.416 --> 17:40.500
Don't you think?

17:42.333 --> 17:43.166
Let's go!

17:52.250 --> 17:53.500
It's quick, right?

17:53.583 --> 17:55.416
It's very quick. Very, very quick.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.750
I can't leave the front desk for too long.

17:59.291 --> 18:03.750
So, um… come over here with me.
I want to tell you something in private.

18:06.125 --> 18:07.166
Come on!

18:07.250 --> 18:08.166
Babi, wait!

18:08.791 --> 18:10.416
I'll find out everything about her!

18:10.500 --> 18:13.375
- This is crazy.
- I'll get his computer, find the password!

18:13.458 --> 18:16.041
If you find something, you'll get hurt.
It's not worth it.

18:16.125 --> 18:17.291
It doesn't matter!

18:18.083 --> 18:18.916
Think.

18:19.500 --> 18:22.750
- I can't stay for long, okay?
- Let me show you something.

18:22.833 --> 18:25.833
- Show me.
- Sweetie!

18:25.916 --> 18:27.958
What's that? I like it that way!

18:28.041 --> 18:31.125
- Wanna see the big boy, do you?
- I do! I want to see.

18:31.208 --> 18:32.958
My birthday? Obvious, right?

18:33.041 --> 18:34.416
Stupid!

18:35.541 --> 18:36.541
The dog's name.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.541
Shit!

18:38.625 --> 18:41.458
- That noise will get me in trouble!
- What noise?

18:43.166 --> 18:45.250
Let me see. Focus here, see.

18:46.041 --> 18:49.166
He wouldn't have been so dumb
as to leave something here. Let's go.

18:56.625 --> 18:57.750
"To Nicole,

18:58.416 --> 19:00.583
happy two-year anniversary, my love.

19:00.666 --> 19:02.916
May many more come. I love you. Caio."

19:13.583 --> 19:15.250
<i>He's been with her for two years.</i>

19:18.291 --> 19:20.291
I'm sorry. I don't even know what to say.

19:22.583 --> 19:24.250
Don't you think it's best if we…

19:25.041 --> 19:26.250
Son of a bitch!

19:29.250 --> 19:31.041
- I'm almost there!
- Bastard!

19:31.125 --> 19:36.000
Bastard! He's going to have to sort
this shit out paper by paper.

19:36.083 --> 19:38.000
So good! Oh…

19:38.083 --> 19:39.666
His Scotch whiskey bottle!

19:39.750 --> 19:42.125
This whiskey is so expensive.
Did you know? Fuck it!

19:42.750 --> 19:44.750
This one too. He'd talk so much about it.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.708
- Babi!
- What a cute bottle. Fuck it!

19:48.375 --> 19:50.125
The little glasses I bought

19:50.208 --> 19:52.458
when he inaugurated the office.

19:52.541 --> 19:55.375
- Oh!
- I'm gonna lose my job, seriously.

19:55.458 --> 19:57.875
- We'll text and meet up another day.
- No, come here!

19:57.958 --> 20:00.416
- Don't you have anything else?
- Whatever you want.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.083
- Clown! Idiot!
- Babi!

20:03.583 --> 20:05.083
- Enough, Babi!
- Stop, Thiago!

20:05.166 --> 20:07.250
- Give me your coat.
- Why?

20:07.833 --> 20:09.500
- Give it to me!
- Let me see.

20:10.208 --> 20:11.708
Wanna see the big lollipop?

20:11.791 --> 20:13.458
Uh-huh.

20:15.166 --> 20:17.666
You can't take his laptop.
We could get arrested.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.666
- It's gonna be a mess!
- It's already a mess.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.000
Let's go.

20:27.333 --> 20:28.458
Let's go, Thiago!

20:28.541 --> 20:30.791
- Wait. I have to go in there.
- No, wait!

20:30.875 --> 20:33.833
- I need to go. I'm serious.
- Stay here. I'm not letting you go.

20:33.916 --> 20:36.833
- Babi…
- The noise wasn't coming from here.

20:37.458 --> 20:39.000
Look, there they are.

20:39.083 --> 20:40.625
- Did it work, friend?
- It did.

20:40.708 --> 20:44.041
My fiancé will love
the little gift I left for him.

20:44.916 --> 20:46.083
I'll explain later.

20:46.916 --> 20:48.083
Message me, okay?

20:52.333 --> 20:54.083
Guys, nobody judge me, okay?

20:54.166 --> 20:58.125
My God, this was the craziest thing
I've ever done in my whole life.

21:00.291 --> 21:01.166
Oh, man.…

21:09.375 --> 21:12.916
Babi, are you sure
you don't want us to stay with you?

21:13.916 --> 21:15.708
I'm sure. I need to be alone.

21:16.958 --> 21:18.666
Bye, friend. Take care, okay?

21:19.250 --> 21:21.875
- Thank you.
- Rest well, really. Try to…

21:35.625 --> 21:38.291
Alexa, why was I betrayed?

21:38.833 --> 21:41.625
<i>I can't find an answer to that question.</i>

21:55.250 --> 21:56.458
Shit!

22:32.083 --> 22:35.583
I'm trying to pretend everything's fine,
but it's not. It's not okay.

22:37.583 --> 22:38.541
But it will be.

22:39.041 --> 22:40.125
It will be, okay?

22:49.083 --> 22:50.125
Babi?

22:51.750 --> 22:52.750
Babi?

22:54.250 --> 22:55.458
Babi? Come on!

22:56.291 --> 22:58.125
- Open up, or I'm breaking in!
- Calm down.

22:58.208 --> 22:59.041
Here. I'm here.

23:01.666 --> 23:02.500
What's this?

23:02.583 --> 23:04.583
Enough already. Snap out of it.

23:04.666 --> 23:06.541
No, girl, I'm not ready.

23:06.625 --> 23:08.958
But you're going to.
Wash your face and come.

23:17.291 --> 23:18.166
Hello!

23:20.625 --> 23:21.541
What's up?

23:21.625 --> 23:22.708
What's up, girl?

23:23.291 --> 23:24.125
I don't know…

23:24.625 --> 23:27.250
I don't know what I like.
I don't know what I want to do.

23:27.833 --> 23:29.583
I'm having an identity crisis.

23:30.708 --> 23:31.666
Suggestion.

23:32.166 --> 23:35.541
What would you never do to your hair
if you were still with Caio?

23:47.166 --> 23:49.208
<i>Gorgeous!</i>

23:55.750 --> 23:59.291
I want Caio out of our office.
We don't need him here.

24:00.125 --> 24:01.125
Wow.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.625
- First, good morning.
- Good morning.

24:03.708 --> 24:05.541
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

24:05.625 --> 24:07.416
I want Caio out of here today.

24:08.041 --> 24:09.916
And if I were you, I'd watch out for him.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.958
Someone who deceives a woman
like he did to me, is capable of anything.

24:13.958 --> 24:15.583
I understand how you're feeling.

24:16.166 --> 24:17.833
And you're absolutely right.

24:18.833 --> 24:21.625
But as your friend, I have to warn you.

24:22.833 --> 24:24.541
You can't be emotional now.

24:25.208 --> 24:28.291
His business represents
almost a third of our income.

24:28.791 --> 24:30.666
He can't just be gone overnight.

24:31.666 --> 24:34.333
- Try not to mix things up.
- I don't know, Thiago.

24:34.416 --> 24:37.458
I don't want any kind of contact.
I don't want… Hold on.

24:37.541 --> 24:39.500
Answer it. I'll be in my office.

24:39.583 --> 24:40.416
Okay.

24:44.041 --> 24:45.791
- Hello?
<i>- Bárbara?</i>

24:45.875 --> 24:48.500
<i>This is João,</i>
<i>Judge Marco Ladeia's assistant.</i>

24:48.583 --> 24:51.791
<i>I left you some messages the other day</i>
<i>but couldn't reach you.</i>

24:51.875 --> 24:53.500
<i>Your folder is still here.</i>

24:55.166 --> 24:57.541
All right, I'll come get it. Thank you.

25:04.791 --> 25:05.875
Hello.

25:05.958 --> 25:07.708
I came to get my folder.

25:07.791 --> 25:09.625
You're Bárbara, right?

25:09.708 --> 25:10.916
Yes.

25:11.000 --> 25:11.875
Please.

25:13.000 --> 25:13.833
This way.

25:14.875 --> 25:16.333
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

25:40.291 --> 25:42.500
- You're the one who forgot the folder.
- Uh-huh.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.666
Marco. Nice to meet you.

25:46.541 --> 25:48.958
Bárbara. But you can call me Babi.

25:50.083 --> 25:50.916
Babi.

25:54.375 --> 25:55.208
Excuse me.

25:55.291 --> 25:56.583
Here's your folder.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.125
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

26:03.625 --> 26:04.708
I'll be on my way.

26:05.416 --> 26:06.416
Thank you.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.000
Thank you.

26:18.083 --> 26:19.041
What?

26:41.916 --> 26:44.916
"Road Harpies Motorcycle Club."

26:45.000 --> 26:46.166
That's interesting.

26:48.166 --> 26:49.083
Babi.

26:49.791 --> 26:52.000
Caio? What are you doing here?

26:52.083 --> 26:54.291
- I need to talk to you.
- Are you following me?

26:54.375 --> 26:56.541
- You're avoiding me.
- I don't wanna talk to you.

26:56.625 --> 26:58.458
I have nothing to say to you. Simple.

26:58.541 --> 27:00.666
I'm asking for a chance to explain myself.

27:00.750 --> 27:02.375
- Please.
- Explain what, Caio?

27:02.458 --> 27:03.375
Speak.

27:03.458 --> 27:06.083
I love you. I'm not seeing her anymore.

27:07.833 --> 27:11.291
For the five years we've spent together.
Let's get out of here. Let's talk.

27:11.375 --> 27:12.291
Try to make peace.

27:12.375 --> 27:15.375
Out of those five years,
you were with her for two.

27:17.125 --> 27:19.708
You are rotten.
I have nothing to hear. Leave me alone.

27:19.791 --> 27:21.250
- This isn't how…
- Don't touch me!

27:21.333 --> 27:22.541
Is he bothering you?

27:28.875 --> 27:30.666
We're sorting out a private matter.

27:32.750 --> 27:34.041
Get out of here.

27:35.666 --> 27:36.875
I'll go.

27:38.500 --> 27:40.041
But I haven't given up on you.

27:50.166 --> 27:51.208
Is everything okay?

27:51.708 --> 27:52.625
Yes.

27:53.625 --> 27:54.708
Everything's okay.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.041
Thank you.

28:05.875 --> 28:06.833
Thank you.

28:10.291 --> 28:11.291
One more, please.

28:13.250 --> 28:14.583
- Are you calmer?
- I am.

28:15.916 --> 28:17.333
No, I'm pissed off.

28:19.666 --> 28:21.166
Who's that guy?

28:21.250 --> 28:22.166
Ex-fiancé.

28:23.166 --> 28:24.291
Current stalker.

28:25.791 --> 28:26.750
And an eternal idiot.

28:28.458 --> 28:32.125
There should be a way to create
a magnetic field around exes, right?

28:32.666 --> 28:37.125
Every time an ex shows up, it's "zap!"
A shock and they're flung far away.

28:39.875 --> 28:40.833
Are you married?

28:42.291 --> 28:45.416
No. I'm in the group of people

28:45.500 --> 28:48.375
who needs a magnetic field like you said.

28:57.666 --> 28:58.875
Do you know that woman?

28:59.916 --> 29:03.416
- Give me a minute. I'll be right back.
- Of course. Go ahead.

29:14.750 --> 29:16.250
Can I have the bill, please?

29:23.041 --> 29:24.750
- Hey, girl.
<i>- Hey, girl.</i>

29:24.833 --> 29:27.083
Sorry I took so long to answer.
I'm on a date.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.666
The guy was in the middle of a sentence,
and I'm polite.

29:29.750 --> 29:31.000
<i>I didn't want to interrupt.</i>

29:31.083 --> 29:33.750
No, go back to your date, crazy.
We'll talk later.

29:33.833 --> 29:36.958
No, no. You can talk. The date is boring.

29:37.041 --> 29:39.083
He talks too much. I just wanna have sex!

29:39.166 --> 29:42.000
I even know the name
of his ex's turtle!

29:42.083 --> 29:44.916
No, it's nothing special.
I wanted to tell you about the judge.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.500
Remember the hot judge
that day at the hearing?

29:47.583 --> 29:48.583
<i>Yes. Did you hook up?</i>

29:48.666 --> 29:51.166
Well, no. I also thought
something would happen,

29:51.250 --> 29:53.458
today we had a drink
near the courthouse,

29:53.541 --> 29:55.875
but then a woman showed up,
kept staring at us.

29:55.958 --> 29:58.000
He got tense and weird.

29:58.083 --> 29:59.541
So, I left, you know?

29:59.625 --> 30:00.958
Yeah, that's weird.

30:01.041 --> 30:04.458
And I did some internet digging now,
and I couldn't find anything about him.

30:04.541 --> 30:07.666
Nothing, girl.
Not one photo, no social media, nothing.

30:07.750 --> 30:09.083
<i>Like a ghost.</i>

30:09.166 --> 30:11.791
Sorry, I didn't hear you. Say that again.

30:11.875 --> 30:14.083
<i>Never mind.</i>
<i>I'm almost home. I'll call you later.</i>

30:14.166 --> 30:15.708
- Okay. See you.
<i>- See you.</i>

31:33.333 --> 31:34.958
Thiago, where are you?

31:35.583 --> 31:39.291
Dude, everything's a mess.
It's all upside down. Can you come over?

31:49.125 --> 31:51.208
Doesn't look like
they took anything from here.

31:51.791 --> 31:53.875
They didn't take
anything from here either!

31:58.500 --> 32:01.125
- Thanks for coming so quickly, for real.
- Of course.

32:01.750 --> 32:03.875
- I was worried about you.
- Me too.

32:05.125 --> 32:09.125
Well, apparently it wasn't a robbery.
It's more like a…

32:09.208 --> 32:10.875
- Yeah…
- A huge mess.

32:12.625 --> 32:13.958
You know what I think?

32:14.666 --> 32:15.875
It was Caio.

32:16.708 --> 32:18.750
Why would he do… this?

32:19.250 --> 32:20.583
I don't know, Thiago.

32:21.083 --> 32:23.250
He came to the courthouse today.
Can you believe it?

32:23.333 --> 32:25.458
We had an argument, and Marco defended me.

32:26.041 --> 32:26.916
Marco?

32:27.500 --> 32:29.208
The judge from the hearing?

32:29.291 --> 32:31.750
That day I left my folder there,
and I went back to get it.

32:32.250 --> 32:35.000
Okay, but what were you doing with him
before Caio arrived?

32:36.000 --> 32:37.916
I want to know, can't I?

32:38.000 --> 32:39.375
Are you guys going out?

32:40.458 --> 32:41.333
No.

32:42.166 --> 32:44.541
Absolutely not. Seriously, it's nothing.

32:44.625 --> 32:47.375
There was a little spark.
We went for a drink.

32:47.458 --> 32:48.583
No big deal.

32:49.583 --> 32:50.708
I don't know, Babi.

32:51.833 --> 32:52.791
Be careful.

32:53.458 --> 32:56.375
I find it very strange
that this judge is hovering around you.

32:57.416 --> 32:59.541
Seriously, you're vulnerable.

33:00.166 --> 33:01.375
I just wanna see you well.

33:01.458 --> 33:08.041
I just want you to be the vibrant,
radiant Babi you've always been, you know?

33:08.125 --> 33:09.375
I want that too.

33:10.333 --> 33:14.208
But I think I lost that Babi somewhere
during those five years with Caio.

33:14.708 --> 33:16.750
I think I don't really know
who I am anymore.

33:18.458 --> 33:19.708
I know who you are.

33:19.791 --> 33:23.166
You're an incredible woman
who's going through bad things.

33:23.833 --> 33:26.541
I want you to know
I'll always be here for you.

33:28.333 --> 33:29.333
I know.

33:30.833 --> 33:32.375
But not just as a friend.

33:34.083 --> 33:35.708
I can be more than that, Babi.

33:38.125 --> 33:39.041
I can…

33:54.000 --> 33:55.625
Um… Thi, it's…

33:56.541 --> 33:58.166
- We better not.
- I'm sorry.

33:58.250 --> 34:00.458
I'm sorry too. I guess I'm still not okay.

34:01.625 --> 34:03.083
Well, do you

34:04.000 --> 34:06.708
need any more help with all this mess?

34:06.791 --> 34:10.375
No. I'm going to distract myself all night
cleaning up this mess.

34:11.625 --> 34:12.791
See you tomorrow?

34:12.875 --> 34:13.708
Definitely.

34:17.375 --> 34:19.083
- Good night.
- Good night.

34:20.375 --> 34:22.500
- Get some rest, okay?
- I will.

34:22.583 --> 34:23.583
See you.

34:30.083 --> 34:33.250
<i>Hi, Camille, how are you?</i>
<i>It's Babi. Do you remember me?</i>

34:33.333 --> 34:37.291
Something unexpected happened,
and I really need my motorcycle back.

35:07.125 --> 35:09.166
You're the new girl who signed up, right?

35:09.250 --> 35:10.791
Right. Babi.

35:11.458 --> 35:13.166
- Alexandre.
- Nice to meet you.

35:13.250 --> 35:15.875
The guys were curious
to know what you were like.

35:16.375 --> 35:18.541
It's been a while
since a woman joined the club.

35:18.625 --> 35:21.583
It can't be easy for you
being among all these men.

35:22.083 --> 35:24.791
- What's holding us up?
- One guy.

35:26.625 --> 35:27.541
Finally.

35:28.250 --> 35:29.333
Let's go, guys.

36:12.958 --> 36:14.750
You're lucky I'm rusty.

36:14.833 --> 36:18.250
Otherwise, I'd already be by the pool
in a bikini waiting for you to arrive.

36:19.375 --> 36:20.500
Oh, yeah?

36:25.083 --> 36:27.166
I've seen your motorcycle
at the courthouse.

36:28.291 --> 36:29.958
I'd never imagine it was yours.

36:30.041 --> 36:33.208
If I'd seen this one, I wouldn't
have imagined it was yours either.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.375
Can I help you?

36:39.375 --> 36:40.375
Thank you.

36:45.791 --> 36:47.041
Nice surprise.

37:17.041 --> 37:18.500
What do you like to drink?

37:19.000 --> 37:22.291
Let's see if you can guess.
What do I look like I drink?

37:23.625 --> 37:25.958
To me, you look like someone who drinks

37:26.458 --> 37:27.291
champagne.

37:28.208 --> 37:30.416
- A very elegant one.
- Good guess.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.166
Open a bottle of champagne for us!
The best you have.

37:35.333 --> 37:36.708
It's on me, all right?

37:36.791 --> 37:39.541
A welcome gift
for joining the motorcycle club.

37:40.291 --> 37:43.583
If I had known I'd be treated so well,
I would've joined sooner.

37:44.333 --> 37:45.958
This treatment is just for you.

37:46.541 --> 37:49.416
To those brutes over there,
not even tap water.

37:49.500 --> 37:50.375
Thank you.

37:51.625 --> 37:54.416
- Look who decided to show up.
- Hey.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
I've reserved two spots
to watch the sunset,

37:58.083 --> 37:59.875
best view on this beach.

38:00.375 --> 38:01.291
Come with me?

38:04.125 --> 38:04.958
Let's go.

38:06.333 --> 38:07.791
That was really good, thank you.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.958
This place you reserved is great.

38:27.500 --> 38:28.875
I love this view.

38:30.583 --> 38:32.541
You know, I've never brought anyone here.

38:32.625 --> 38:33.541
Really?

38:34.166 --> 38:36.666
I guess I got used to doing things alone.

38:38.416 --> 38:39.666
I actually prefer it.

38:40.208 --> 38:41.166
I mean,

38:42.208 --> 38:43.625
with you it's different.

38:46.250 --> 38:48.458
Will you think I'm crazy
if I tell you something?

38:48.541 --> 38:49.375
Tell me.

38:49.875 --> 38:52.791
I think you appeared in my dream
before I met you.

38:53.375 --> 38:54.958
- Really?
- Really. I swear.

38:55.041 --> 38:56.541
What was the dream like?

38:58.000 --> 39:00.583
Oh, I don't think
I'll have the guts to tell you.

39:01.208 --> 39:02.291
Try me.

39:05.791 --> 39:06.666
Okay.

39:07.541 --> 39:10.166
We were on our motorcycles,

39:10.250 --> 39:12.708
riding fast. It was raining,

39:14.000 --> 39:16.916
and you slipped, fell, hurt your arm.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.458
Then we entered a dark warehouse…

39:20.041 --> 39:21.750
- And?
- And…

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
Guess.

39:38.125 --> 39:39.208
Did I guess right?

39:39.833 --> 39:40.666
Uh-huh.

39:47.708 --> 39:48.958
Pick it up.

39:49.750 --> 39:50.791
Excuse me.

39:51.958 --> 39:52.833
Hello?

39:53.750 --> 39:55.000
Hi. No.

39:55.083 --> 39:56.208
What do you mean?

39:57.375 --> 39:59.125
It can't be. Again?

40:00.208 --> 40:02.458
Sorry, I have to deal with a problem.
It's urgent.

40:03.041 --> 40:04.083
Yes?

40:04.166 --> 40:07.166
No, I can get there. I'm on my motorcycle.
I'll be there quickly.

40:10.333 --> 40:11.208
All right.

40:13.083 --> 40:15.958
If this shit keeps happening,
I might do something crazy.

40:32.791 --> 40:35.583
What do you mean, he left you hanging?
What a crazy guy!

40:35.666 --> 40:38.291
<i>The worst part is I really wanted</i>
<i>to hook up with him.</i>

40:38.375 --> 40:39.375
<i>Like, it was good.</i>

40:39.458 --> 40:41.583
<i>Can't you meet later?</i>

40:41.666 --> 40:44.125
I don't know. I think he already left.

40:45.041 --> 40:47.375
It was also very weird, the way he left.

40:48.083 --> 40:50.000
Maybe it's the universe
trying to guide me.

40:50.083 --> 40:51.125
"Better not to insist."

40:51.208 --> 40:52.791
<i>Well, I'm wearing </i>these.

40:52.875 --> 40:53.833
Let me see.

40:54.583 --> 40:56.125
<i>Those panties are horrible</i>.

40:56.208 --> 40:59.166
Exactly, dear. It's perfect!

40:59.250 --> 41:00.083
Explain.

41:00.166 --> 41:02.541
I'm not in the mood
to hook up with this guy.

41:02.625 --> 41:04.625
So, if I feel like doing something stupid,

41:04.708 --> 41:07.791
<i>I'll remember that I'm wearing</i>
<i>these panties and I'll give up.</i>

41:07.875 --> 41:09.833
If you don't want it, why are you going?

41:09.916 --> 41:13.250
Boredom. I hate staying at home
doing nothing on my weekends!

41:13.750 --> 41:16.958
And that's why you need your panties
to do the work for you.

41:17.041 --> 41:19.083
- Bye, Paty! Bye.
<i>- Kisses, bye.</i>

41:56.208 --> 41:57.291
Babi?

41:57.916 --> 42:01.625
We're going to eat at the restaurant.
We'll have some drinks there.

42:02.250 --> 42:03.416
Do you want to join us?

42:04.833 --> 42:07.333
Thanks. I'm going for a walk on the beach.

42:08.458 --> 42:09.500
Want company?

42:10.500 --> 42:11.416
Thanks.

42:12.500 --> 42:13.666
Can't hurt to try.

43:15.250 --> 43:18.583
- Sorry about earlier, Babi.
- No need to explain.

43:19.458 --> 43:21.958
I really wanted to hook up with you
this afternoon.

43:22.458 --> 43:23.458
But that's all.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.291
I'm not looking for a relationship.
I don't want anything serious.

43:27.375 --> 43:30.291
You don't need to waste
your breath on me, got it?

43:31.041 --> 43:31.916
I understand.

43:32.458 --> 43:33.458
More or less.

43:33.958 --> 43:35.333
What I'm trying to say

43:36.875 --> 43:39.166
is that if you're going
to waste your breath on me…

43:41.458 --> 43:42.833
waste it in a different way.

47:10.750 --> 47:13.291
"I had to go. One day
I'll tell you everything about me."

47:13.375 --> 47:15.541
"Thank you for the best night of my life."

47:31.375 --> 47:33.791
- Good morning.
- You were the only one missing.

47:34.541 --> 47:35.708
We can go.

47:39.750 --> 47:44.291
Look, I don't know what's going on
between you and Marco, but don't be upset.

47:44.916 --> 47:47.583
That guy is strange,
doesn't talk properly to anyone.

47:48.541 --> 47:51.500
He's full of mysteries.
You should stay away from him.

48:33.791 --> 48:37.500
STAY AWAY FROM MARCO

48:39.708 --> 48:41.666
Wow, Babi. Creepy, huh?

48:41.750 --> 48:44.416
- Isn't it?
- But at least the hook-up was good, right?

48:44.500 --> 48:46.833
- Stop it. No joking.
- Sorry.

48:47.333 --> 48:50.666
- I think you should file a police report.
- But who am I reporting?

48:50.750 --> 48:52.166
I have no idea who it was.

48:52.666 --> 48:55.666
Like, it could be Caio,
for obvious reasons…

48:56.541 --> 48:57.958
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

48:59.125 --> 49:01.000
But it could be his mistress.

49:01.541 --> 49:04.750
It could be that crazy-looking woman
at the bar when I was with Marco.

49:05.333 --> 49:06.250
It could be Thiago.

49:06.333 --> 49:08.000
- Thiago?
- Keep it down.

49:08.500 --> 49:10.166
- But he's your partner.
- I know.

49:10.250 --> 49:11.416
And your best friend.

49:11.500 --> 49:14.583
Yeah, but the last time I saw him,
it was so strange.

49:15.083 --> 49:16.458
I didn't tell you, did I?

49:16.541 --> 49:18.833
He came to my house
and confessed his feelings.

49:19.458 --> 49:22.750
- And then?
- Said he wanted to be more than friends…

49:23.250 --> 49:25.750
And? You're killing
the gossipmonger with curiosity.

49:25.833 --> 49:28.750
- He kissed me.
- What? On the lips?

49:28.833 --> 49:30.625
No, on the cheek. Of course, Patrícia!

49:30.708 --> 49:32.583
No way. Juiciest gossip of the year!

49:34.500 --> 49:37.333
I'm so confused.
I don't even know what to think.

49:37.833 --> 49:40.208
No, but that couldn't have been Thiago.
You know why?

49:40.708 --> 49:43.041
That same night you were at the resort,

49:43.125 --> 49:45.125
he was miles away with his friends.

49:45.208 --> 49:47.291
He couldn't have followed you
and filmed that.

49:47.375 --> 49:49.916
- How do you know?
- Well, look at this.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
He posted it that night. He was far away.

49:53.083 --> 49:54.791
Wow, I'm glad you saw this.

49:54.875 --> 49:57.500
You see how I am? I'm going crazy.

49:57.583 --> 49:59.750
I'm starting to suspect
even my best friend.

49:59.833 --> 50:02.750
Come here. Stay calm.
It's normal to feel this confused.

50:02.833 --> 50:04.750
- Thank you, girl.
- No. And look.

50:04.833 --> 50:08.041
Don't let these boys disrupt your peace,
okay? You are wonderful.

50:08.125 --> 50:10.958
Focus on your things, on your dreams.

50:11.041 --> 50:12.125
Snap out of it.

50:12.208 --> 50:14.708
- Now, let's go.
- Enough. Let's go for real.

50:38.958 --> 50:40.583
MARCO MISSED CALL

51:06.125 --> 51:08.250
"Expensive whiskeys."

51:08.333 --> 51:12.541
"Good Saints, rare 1937 collection."

51:17.750 --> 51:18.708
Gotcha!

51:19.375 --> 51:20.250
Sucker.

51:25.375 --> 51:27.625
IMPORT CONTRACT

51:36.958 --> 51:38.000
Thiago!

51:38.083 --> 51:39.208
- Yeah?
- Come here.

51:42.500 --> 51:43.500
Look at this.

51:47.416 --> 51:49.500
Do you realize how serious this is?

51:50.166 --> 51:52.791
These are fake accounts
that never came through our office.

51:52.875 --> 51:54.791
- How did you not see this?
- Impossible…

51:54.875 --> 51:57.166
He's involved in the construction scheme.

51:57.250 --> 51:59.958
- He's been deceiving us all along.
- Son of a bitch.

52:00.041 --> 52:01.416
This is really serious.

52:01.500 --> 52:03.500
I always thought he spent too much money.

52:04.416 --> 52:06.250
I didn't tell you so you wouldn't worry.

52:06.333 --> 52:07.208
Now what?

52:07.791 --> 52:08.916
I don't know, Babi.

52:09.458 --> 52:12.125
Do you want me to go to his office?
I want to punch him.

52:12.208 --> 52:15.125
No! Stay calm. Now we need to be smart.

52:15.708 --> 52:17.250
- We have to act calmly.
- Stay calm?

52:17.333 --> 52:18.708
- Yes.
- Stay calm, Babi?

52:18.791 --> 52:20.708
This guy is a criminal. He's a crook.

52:20.791 --> 52:22.750
He's no longer the Caio you knew.

52:23.250 --> 52:25.750
- He needs a beating to learn!
- Look at me.

52:25.833 --> 52:28.291
If you beat him up,
besides facing a lawsuit,

52:28.375 --> 52:30.875
he'll get rid of the evidence.
He'll act quickly!

52:31.958 --> 52:33.500
We need to be smarter than him.

52:34.416 --> 52:37.541
We need to keep this laptop
and take it straight to the prosecutor.

52:38.041 --> 52:39.791
Or directly to the judge on the case!

52:40.375 --> 52:41.708
- Marco?
- Yes.

52:43.208 --> 52:44.875
I think he would help us.

52:45.500 --> 52:48.708
Okay. But before that,
let's take it to our lawyers.

52:49.666 --> 52:50.791
Let's see what they say.

52:50.875 --> 52:53.416
There might be a solution
smarter than this.

52:53.500 --> 52:55.125
- Okay.
- Babi.

52:55.875 --> 52:58.333
I swear I didn't know anything.

52:58.416 --> 53:00.416
I won't be complicit in any crime.

53:00.500 --> 53:01.791
Me neither.

53:02.416 --> 53:05.125
I'm with you all the way on this,
do you understand?

53:05.916 --> 53:06.833
Hold on.

53:08.291 --> 53:12.208
Excuse me, are you Bárbara Vieira?
I have a delivery for you.

53:12.291 --> 53:13.333
Thank you.

53:13.416 --> 53:14.500
Good morning.

53:16.333 --> 53:17.458
Who sent it?

53:18.541 --> 53:19.500
Marco.

53:20.083 --> 53:21.125
Figures.

53:21.791 --> 53:23.666
Look, Babi, don't take it the wrong way,

53:24.166 --> 53:27.125
but it's very weird for this judge
to be harassing you like this.

53:27.666 --> 53:30.000
- That's a bummer<i>, </i>Thiago.
- No, not a bummer.

53:30.500 --> 53:32.833
Didn't you tell me the other day
to keep an eye out?

53:33.958 --> 53:35.750
Lots of ill-intentioned people around.

53:37.916 --> 53:39.041
Excuse me.

53:39.125 --> 53:40.291
Bye.

53:40.375 --> 53:42.125
Don't mind him. He's jealous.

53:42.833 --> 53:43.708
Read it.

53:45.458 --> 53:48.166
"I apologize for how I left that day."

53:48.250 --> 53:50.250
"Have dinner with me
at my house tomorrow?"

53:50.333 --> 53:52.958
"I'll send a car for you
at 7:00 p.m. sharp."

53:53.041 --> 53:54.208
I find it elegant.

53:54.291 --> 53:56.958
I don't. And I don't want to go, okay?

53:57.875 --> 54:00.750
After everything I've been through
with Caio, I can't risk it.

54:01.333 --> 54:04.958
What if Thiago is right?
What if he's really a crook in disguise?

54:05.041 --> 54:07.875
If you keep thinking
that every guy is a liar like Caio,

54:07.958 --> 54:10.416
you won't date anyone else.
Don't you agree?

54:10.500 --> 54:13.125
I don't know if he deserves
this second chance, you know?

54:13.208 --> 54:14.208
You know what I think?

54:14.833 --> 54:17.000
I think the best things in life

54:17.083 --> 54:19.500
are miracles disguised as second chances.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.958
I'm not saying this
so you give Marco a second chance.

54:23.625 --> 54:24.708
It's for yourself.

54:25.708 --> 54:27.666
That's beautiful.
Did you come up with that?

54:27.750 --> 54:30.458
Of course not! I saw it in a book
or a fortune cookie.

54:30.541 --> 54:33.000
It doesn't matter where.
What matters is the message.

56:26.958 --> 56:29.125
I was afraid you wouldn't come.

56:29.708 --> 56:31.208
And I was afraid to come.

56:32.291 --> 56:33.625
I'm glad you came.

56:34.250 --> 56:35.875
- May I?
- Of course.

56:44.625 --> 56:46.791
I set up a little place for us here.

56:55.750 --> 56:56.958
Thank you.

57:05.291 --> 57:07.416
- Would you like some wine?
- Please.

57:10.166 --> 57:11.875
I hope you like lamb.

57:12.375 --> 57:14.375
- Did you make it?
- Mm-hmm.

57:16.750 --> 57:19.208
I started to suspect
he was stealing from his partner.

57:19.291 --> 57:22.083
- And then?
- So, I confronted the guy

57:22.166 --> 57:25.958
in front of everyone, and of course,
his partner believed him. I lost my job.

57:27.083 --> 57:30.208
I spent a few months paying the cleaner

57:30.291 --> 57:32.750
to give me the guy's trash
at the end of each day.

57:32.833 --> 57:37.375
And then I managed to find some evidence
I needed to put together a dossier

57:37.458 --> 57:40.208
and send it to the partner's house
with a bouquet of flowers.

57:40.291 --> 57:42.583
She ended the partnership

57:43.583 --> 57:45.041
and offered me a job,

57:45.125 --> 57:48.500
but by that time, I was already focused
on the idea of becoming a judge.

57:48.583 --> 57:50.916
I needed to study, so I didn't take it.

57:51.541 --> 57:54.750
Wow. Nineteen years old
and you were already like that?

57:55.916 --> 57:56.875
Obsessed?

57:59.375 --> 58:01.250
I've always pursued the truth.

58:04.416 --> 58:06.166
A toast to the truth then.

58:06.250 --> 58:07.666
A toast to the truth.

58:16.041 --> 58:18.708
I had forgotten
that life could be this light.

58:19.208 --> 58:20.041
Enjoyable.

58:21.791 --> 58:23.333
I had forgotten who I was.

58:26.583 --> 58:28.333
I need to use the restroom.

58:28.416 --> 58:29.291
Sure.

58:30.125 --> 58:32.333
It's at the end of the hallway,
on the left.

58:33.208 --> 58:34.250
Excuse me.

59:01.541 --> 59:02.958
What are you doing here?

59:03.833 --> 59:04.875
I…

59:05.625 --> 59:07.041
think I got the wrong door.

59:08.333 --> 59:10.333
The bathroom is that way.

59:10.416 --> 59:11.458
Okay.

59:39.666 --> 59:41.208
Your phone hasn't stopped ringing.

59:41.875 --> 59:42.958
Let me see.

59:43.041 --> 59:46.666
Oh, it's Paty, my friend.
We have a security app

59:46.750 --> 59:49.333
that sends each other real-time locations.

59:49.416 --> 59:50.833
I'm letting her know I'm okay.

59:51.958 --> 59:55.833
Hi, girl. I forgot to tell you
I agreed to have dinner with Marco.

59:56.375 --> 59:57.791
I'm being treated well.

59:58.375 --> 01:00:00.875
And I found out
that he lives in a paradox.

01:00:01.375 --> 01:00:03.291
Obsessed with the truth

01:00:03.791 --> 01:00:05.958
and mysterious at the same time.

01:00:08.708 --> 01:00:10.000
But don't worry.

01:00:11.083 --> 01:00:12.791
I don't think he's dangerous.

01:00:14.166 --> 01:00:15.375
I'll call you later.

01:03:37.166 --> 01:03:39.500
It's so hard for me to trust someone.

01:03:40.708 --> 01:03:42.916
To talk about what I feel.

01:03:46.625 --> 01:03:48.583
Lately, I've been going through a lot of

01:03:49.416 --> 01:03:50.666
complicated things.

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:53.625
I still am.

01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:58.666
But with you by my side,

01:03:58.750 --> 01:04:02.375
I feel like things can start
going right for me again.

01:04:06.583 --> 01:04:09.291
You talk so much
about how complicated your life is.

01:04:13.291 --> 01:04:15.916
What's so complicated
that you can't tell me?

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.083
I know. He's with her.

01:04:20.166 --> 01:04:22.916
- Don't touch me.
- I'm going to call Mr. Marco.

01:04:26.583 --> 01:04:28.208
- Please, Ms. Paula…
- Don't touch me.

01:04:28.291 --> 01:04:31.333
Wait. I'm going to call Dr. Marco,
but you have to wait downstairs.

01:04:31.416 --> 01:04:33.750
Wait? You're crazy.
This house is mine too.

01:04:33.833 --> 01:04:36.666
Paula, what are you doing here?
Can you please leave?

01:04:37.583 --> 01:04:40.541
So you're the idiot
who's seeing my husband?

01:04:41.625 --> 01:04:42.458
Husband?

01:04:43.125 --> 01:04:45.916
- It's not like that, Babi.
- Are you married?

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.625
Yes, we are. We're married, yes.
Very much married. You didn't know?

01:04:51.958 --> 01:04:54.291
Oh, what a sad little face.

01:04:55.041 --> 01:04:57.833
So you believed his little story, huh?

01:04:58.458 --> 01:05:01.416
The poor hurt man.
Disillusioned. Needs care, right?

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.958
- Shut up, Paula!
- No. Don't "Shut up" me.

01:05:04.041 --> 01:05:08.125
She needs to know the truth.
She needs to know what you've done to me.

01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:10.833
How you ruined my life,

01:05:10.916 --> 01:05:13.125
how you left me alone
when I needed you the most.

01:05:13.208 --> 01:05:16.375
She needs to know what a monster,
what a bastard you are.

01:05:17.291 --> 01:05:21.291
Now, if he did this to me,
to his own wife,

01:05:21.375 --> 01:05:23.500
imagine what he'll do to you?

01:05:24.291 --> 01:05:26.125
A meaningless fuck.

01:05:27.458 --> 01:05:28.583
- Babi.
- Excuse me.

01:05:28.666 --> 01:05:30.375
You had no right.

01:05:30.458 --> 01:05:32.541
Go! Go away. You can go. Go!

01:05:32.625 --> 01:05:33.833
Babi, wait! Listen to me.

01:05:33.916 --> 01:05:34.750
Let go of me!

01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:38.125
The guy who pursues the truth, right?

01:05:39.125 --> 01:05:41.791
All of that to hide
the big liar that you are.

01:05:42.541 --> 01:05:44.541
Don't come looking for me anymore.

01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:46.750
Don't come after me.

01:06:40.958 --> 01:06:42.750
Hi, Sleeping Beauty.

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.375
- Hi, girl.
- What's up? Let's eat?

01:06:46.333 --> 01:06:49.041
Let's have some soup.

01:06:50.416 --> 01:06:51.250
Excuse me.

01:06:51.833 --> 01:06:54.541
Since he's here, I'm gonna
take your folks to eat something.

01:06:54.625 --> 01:06:56.250
- Okay.
- What do you think? Let's go?

01:06:56.333 --> 01:06:57.875
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

01:06:57.958 --> 01:06:59.791
- Take care of her, okay?
- You got it.

01:07:05.125 --> 01:07:06.208
I brought chocolates.

01:07:07.041 --> 01:07:08.250
I want that.

01:07:12.375 --> 01:07:13.250
Hi.

01:07:15.458 --> 01:07:16.458
My God.

01:07:17.458 --> 01:07:18.916
What a scare, huh, Babi?

01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:20.458
Yeah, right?

01:07:24.416 --> 01:07:27.708
But what matters is that you're okay now,
out of danger.

01:07:27.791 --> 01:07:29.000
I hope so.

01:07:30.333 --> 01:07:31.833
Oh, Thi, I don't…

01:07:32.666 --> 01:07:34.375
I don't remember much,

01:07:35.916 --> 01:07:39.958
but I had the feeling
they deliberately drove the car at me.

01:07:40.041 --> 01:07:41.041
On purpose?

01:07:41.583 --> 01:07:42.416
Uh-huh.

01:07:43.083 --> 01:07:45.250
That's very serious. Who would do that?

01:07:45.958 --> 01:07:47.000
I don't know.

01:07:47.083 --> 01:07:51.166
I don't even know if that's what happened,
but it's the feeling I had.

01:07:52.208 --> 01:07:53.333
Only if Caio…

01:07:53.916 --> 01:07:54.958
Caio?

01:07:55.041 --> 01:07:57.208
I don't know
what to think anymore, honestly.

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:00.250
Excuse me.

01:08:04.666 --> 01:08:06.625
It's good to see you awake.

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.750
We don't have anything to talk about.

01:08:10.791 --> 01:08:13.666
We don't have to talk now.

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:16.833
I just wanted to see you.

01:08:19.375 --> 01:08:20.291
You've seen me.

01:08:25.041 --> 01:08:25.875
Look…

01:08:26.541 --> 01:08:28.166
Babi is very thankful

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.166
for the flowers.

01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:32.500
But she needs to rest.

01:08:33.958 --> 01:08:35.958
I think it's best you leave.

01:08:52.916 --> 01:08:53.791
Are you okay?

01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:55.583
Yeah.

01:08:55.666 --> 01:08:58.416
Hey, Fernando, it's Marco.
How's it going, man?

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.250
I need to ask you a favor.

01:09:05.375 --> 01:09:08.791
I need to check some traffic images…

01:09:11.333 --> 01:09:13.291
and I need to wiretap someone.

01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:25.000
Come on, dear. Everything's okay.

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.291
- Thank you.
- Are you okay?

01:09:27.875 --> 01:09:29.375
Now go get some rest, okay?

01:09:29.875 --> 01:09:31.250
And that's it.

01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:33.416
Here you go. Drink. It's nice and warm.

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.208
- Thanks, Mom.
- You're welcome, dear.

01:09:35.291 --> 01:09:37.916
It'll also be good
to get back to work, you know?

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.833
- I think I'll drop by tomorrow.
- No, you don't need to.

01:09:40.916 --> 01:09:43.666
- Thiago and I can handle it.
- I know, but I want to go.

01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:45.416
There's no point in staying at home.

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.833
Thinking nonsense,
getting depressed. It's worse.

01:09:47.916 --> 01:09:50.791
Oh, come on. I won't allow that at all.

01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:54.125
If I start feeling unwell,
I promise I'll come home.

01:09:54.208 --> 01:09:55.625
- I promise.
- We'll see.

01:09:57.666 --> 01:09:59.916
Could you answer the intercom for me,
Mom, please?

01:10:01.916 --> 01:10:04.875
Hello? Just a minute, please.

01:10:04.958 --> 01:10:06.583
Marco's at the door.

01:10:08.125 --> 01:10:09.166
Marco?

01:10:11.583 --> 01:10:12.416
Hello.

01:10:14.541 --> 01:10:16.666
I think it's not the best time, but…

01:10:18.875 --> 01:10:21.375
I need to explain myself
after what happened at home.

01:10:22.625 --> 01:10:24.125
More than explain myself.

01:10:25.666 --> 01:10:27.750
<i>I need you to see it with your own eyes.</i>

01:10:35.708 --> 01:10:37.458
Vitória has a rare condition.

01:10:38.291 --> 01:10:39.916
<i>Emanuel Syndrome.</i>

01:10:42.833 --> 01:10:45.708
<i>She has weak muscle tone.</i>

01:10:48.541 --> 01:10:51.333
<i>She was born</i>
<i>with some developmental problems.</i>

01:10:54.791 --> 01:10:58.625
A malformation of the intestines,
and a heart problem.

01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:03.958
- Paula is Vitória's mother?
- Yes.

01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:08.166
Are you still married?

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.125
We were married. For four years.

01:11:12.375 --> 01:11:15.458
At first, we were happy, of course.

01:11:16.958 --> 01:11:20.041
But even before getting pregnant,

01:11:20.125 --> 01:11:22.916
Paula's mental health worried me.

01:11:28.291 --> 01:11:31.000
And when she got pregnant,
it only got worse.

01:11:33.083 --> 01:11:34.875
<i>I did everything.</i>

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:37.416
<i>Took her to a psychologist,</i>
<i>a psychiatrist, but</i>

01:11:38.791 --> 01:11:41.000
<i>she would start treatment</i>
<i>and then abandon it.</i>

01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:45.125
Then Vitória was born,

01:11:45.833 --> 01:11:47.833
and we found out about the syndrome…

01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:52.500
I thought that by getting married,
having a child, becoming a mother,

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.666
I would find myself in life.

01:11:57.541 --> 01:12:00.583
But it seems
that the exact opposite happened.

01:12:02.208 --> 01:12:06.000
<i>I kept losing myself more and more.</i>

01:12:08.583 --> 01:12:09.625
It won't go away.

01:12:12.916 --> 01:12:14.333
I know it won't.

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:18.958
<i>Did you keep taking care of her?</i>

01:12:19.041 --> 01:12:21.666
Yes, of course. We stayed together.

01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:22.875
I tried.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.416
<i>Until one night she came to the hospital,</i>

01:12:29.875 --> 01:12:31.583
took Vitória from the room

01:12:32.291 --> 01:12:33.291
and tried to run away.

01:12:35.875 --> 01:12:38.041
<i>And Vitória can't survive</i>
<i>without the machines.</i>

01:12:39.458 --> 01:12:41.958
Thank goodness I was here to stop her.

01:12:43.416 --> 01:12:45.083
<i>To save my daughter's life,</i>

01:12:45.166 --> 01:12:48.875
<i>I had to legally prevent Paula</i>
<i>from having contact with Vitória.</i>

01:12:49.791 --> 01:12:52.208
<i>It was the hardest decision of my life.</i>

01:12:53.666 --> 01:12:56.916
That's why that day on the pier
I ended up leaving you alone.

01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:01.125
They called me from the hospital saying
she was trying to get in by any means.

01:13:02.708 --> 01:13:03.875
After all of that,

01:13:04.666 --> 01:13:08.250
I swore I'd never
get involved with anyone again.

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:12.541
But the truth is…

01:13:16.083 --> 01:13:18.958
I'm completely in love with you.

01:13:22.041 --> 01:13:24.750
My divorce with Paula
is about to be finalized.

01:13:25.333 --> 01:13:26.333
Any day now.

01:13:27.833 --> 01:13:29.708
And I'll be able to restart my life.

01:13:30.958 --> 01:13:34.083
Well, we should wait then, right?

01:13:35.625 --> 01:13:37.416
I've waited long enough, Babi.

01:13:38.333 --> 01:13:40.083
I'm certain of what I want.

01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:47.958
Marco, I think I need some time
to process all of this.

01:13:48.041 --> 01:13:49.916
It's a lot of information,

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.666
and I also have a serious issue
at work to take care of.

01:13:54.250 --> 01:13:55.541
Give me some time.

01:13:57.250 --> 01:13:58.333
Some time for us.

01:14:02.041 --> 01:14:02.916
Fair enough.

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:05.333
I'll wait.

01:14:16.625 --> 01:14:18.000
Thank you, Fernando.

01:14:18.083 --> 01:14:20.666
<i>If anything comes up on the wiretap,</i>
<i>I'll let you know.</i>

01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:21.958
- Okay.
<i>- Bye.</i>

01:14:23.291 --> 01:14:25.625
- They looked up the license plate.
- And?

01:14:26.291 --> 01:14:29.250
It's cloned. This story keeps getting
weirder and weirder.

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:33.291
It could be an unfortunate coincidence,
I don't know.

01:14:33.791 --> 01:14:36.291
Just in case,
Fernando put in the wiretaps.

01:14:36.833 --> 01:14:39.375
What you're doing
could get you in serious shit, right?

01:14:39.458 --> 01:14:40.416
You know that.

01:14:41.541 --> 01:14:44.958
I need to know what's happening.
I have to protect Babi.

01:14:56.833 --> 01:14:58.000
Decaf.

01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:03.208
You're the one recovering,
and I'm getting pampered? Not fair.

01:15:03.291 --> 01:15:05.041
I'm very happy you're back.

01:15:05.125 --> 01:15:07.791
Me too. Hey, let me ask you something.

01:15:08.666 --> 01:15:11.333
What's up with Caio's computer?

01:15:11.416 --> 01:15:13.375
Did you talk to the lawyers?
Did you show them?

01:15:13.458 --> 01:15:15.375
I did. I left the laptop with them,

01:15:15.458 --> 01:15:18.500
but these things take time,
Babi, you know it, right?

01:15:18.583 --> 01:15:21.541
I think we should bring it
straight to Marco.

01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:29.333
But Marco is the judge, Babi.
The judge on the case. It can't go to him.

01:15:29.416 --> 01:15:32.416
I know. But he's proving
to be an amazing person.

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:33.875
He's willing to help.

01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:36.458
And he'd expedite the whole process.

01:15:38.916 --> 01:15:40.250
Should we do that?

01:15:41.416 --> 01:15:43.375
We can't let Caio go unpunished anymore.

01:15:43.875 --> 01:15:44.875
You're right.

01:15:46.166 --> 01:15:48.833
Let's just put an end to this.
I'm with you.

01:15:48.916 --> 01:15:51.208
Let's go now, then? To the courthouse?

01:15:51.291 --> 01:15:54.000
I just need to stop by my place
and get copies of the files.

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:55.958
- Oh, you made copies?
- Obviously.

01:15:56.041 --> 01:15:59.791
It's all on the cloud, on hard drives.
I just gotta swing by home to get them.

01:16:01.166 --> 01:16:02.625
Great, that's important.

01:16:06.375 --> 01:16:08.750
I just need to sort out a few things,

01:16:09.416 --> 01:16:12.500
and I can pick you up
at your place in two hours, okay?

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:13.833
Sounds good.

01:16:13.916 --> 01:16:15.000
- Okay.
- See you soon.

01:16:15.083 --> 01:16:15.916
See you soon.

01:16:17.250 --> 01:16:18.083
Just--

01:16:18.583 --> 01:16:19.458
I'll fix it.

01:17:16.083 --> 01:17:16.916
Hey, Caio.

01:17:22.625 --> 01:17:23.750
What happened?

01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:27.750
They broke into my house. Tortured me.

01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:32.750
They're watching everything, Thiago.

01:17:33.375 --> 01:17:37.416
They said if I don't fix this shit,
I should expect the worst.

01:17:40.208 --> 01:17:42.291
You have to tell them it's not my fault.

01:17:42.375 --> 01:17:43.791
I didn't give Babi the laptop.

01:17:43.875 --> 01:17:44.875
It's pointless.

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:47.750
What Babi knows incriminates everyone.

01:17:48.458 --> 01:17:51.083
Fuck, I want out.
I don't wanna be part of this anymore.

01:17:51.583 --> 01:17:52.458
I want out.

01:17:53.583 --> 01:17:54.875
Let me make this clear.

01:17:56.666 --> 01:17:58.958
If Babi and the evidence don't disappear,

01:17:59.041 --> 01:18:01.083
we'll be the ones who disappear, got it?

01:18:02.583 --> 01:18:05.833
When you said I could get more cash
with that damn construction company,

01:18:05.916 --> 01:18:08.416
I didn't know you'd involve us
with criminals.

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:09.958
What did you fucking think?

01:18:17.208 --> 01:18:19.541
You pretended not to know
where the money came from.

01:18:20.583 --> 01:18:22.708
Although, you didn't mind
spending it, right?

01:18:23.375 --> 01:18:25.250
Car, jewelry,

01:18:26.333 --> 01:18:27.541
whiskey,

01:18:27.625 --> 01:18:28.500
mistress.

01:18:30.583 --> 01:18:33.250
You splurged so much
that I had to get you away from Babi.

01:18:35.625 --> 01:18:37.625
I did everything
to keep her off the radar.

01:18:39.333 --> 01:18:40.500
I stalked her,

01:18:41.791 --> 01:18:42.708
<i>threatened her,</i>

01:18:43.541 --> 01:18:46.958
had her fucking motorcycle crashed,
but Babi is stubborn.

01:18:48.666 --> 01:18:50.791
Now she's in love with that judge.

01:18:51.375 --> 01:18:54.458
And I guess that you,
with all your brains,

01:18:54.541 --> 01:18:56.250
already know what that means.

01:18:59.166 --> 01:19:00.000
From now on,

01:19:01.208 --> 01:19:02.250
it's her or us.

01:19:04.333 --> 01:19:05.708
What do you prefer?

01:19:17.625 --> 01:19:18.791
Babi is in danger.

01:19:41.041 --> 01:19:42.041
What's up?

01:19:42.125 --> 01:19:43.833
- Do you have everything?
- Yes.

01:19:45.666 --> 01:19:46.541
Right here.

01:19:48.666 --> 01:19:49.708
Let's go.

01:20:04.875 --> 01:20:08.000
I'm relieved to hand over
this evidence to Marco, you know?

01:20:08.708 --> 01:20:10.833
I think we're doing the right thing.

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:12.833
I'm sure we are.

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:23.791
Thiago, isn't the courthouse
the other way?

01:20:23.875 --> 01:20:26.583
Yes, Babi,
the courthouse is the other way.

01:20:27.166 --> 01:20:28.625
So what route is this?

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.041
What's happening?

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
What's this?

01:20:48.208 --> 01:20:50.250
I think you'd better stay quiet, Babi.

01:20:59.750 --> 01:21:01.291
Come on, Babi. Pick up!

01:21:06.333 --> 01:21:07.208
Don't answer it.

01:21:09.541 --> 01:21:11.750
- I'm in the car with Thiago…
- Are you crazy?

01:21:11.833 --> 01:21:13.416
- Stop!
- Give me that shit.

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.041
Stop, Thiago, you're gonna crash!

01:21:15.708 --> 01:21:17.666
Try me! Shut up!

01:21:18.583 --> 01:21:20.416
Fuck!

01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.375
Try that shit again and see what happens!

01:21:27.708 --> 01:21:28.791
<i>Hello? Marco?</i>

01:21:28.875 --> 01:21:31.458
Hey, Paty, thank God. Babi's in trouble.

01:21:31.541 --> 01:21:33.875
You have that location app, right?

01:21:33.958 --> 01:21:36.916
<i>- Oh my God. Just a sec, let me check.</i>
- Please.

01:21:37.791 --> 01:21:40.166
- Go!
<i>- Here it is, found it.</i>

01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:43.083
<i>She's leaving Marginal Pinheiros</i>
<i>and getting onto Guido Caloi.</i>

01:21:43.166 --> 01:21:45.125
Okay. Stay on the line! Stay there!

01:21:45.208 --> 01:21:48.500
Thiago, if this is about the report,
if you're involved,

01:21:49.125 --> 01:21:52.208
we can talk. You're my brother.
I don't want to screw you over.

01:21:52.291 --> 01:21:54.041
I don't believe you anymore, Babi.

01:21:54.125 --> 01:21:56.458
Now shut the fuck up and let me drive.

01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:02.875
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello, Secretary Aguiar?

01:22:02.958 --> 01:22:04.833
<i>- Hi, Marco.</i>
<i>- </i>I have evidence that two men

01:22:04.916 --> 01:22:06.708
are planning to kill an innocent woman.

01:22:06.791 --> 01:22:08.416
I'm sending you my location.

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:10.166
We don't have much time, Secretary.

01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:13.000
<i>Calm down. Don't do anything</i>
<i>until the cops arrive, got it</i>?

01:22:13.083 --> 01:22:14.166
All right.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.875
- Go on.
<i>- They're getting close to the dam.</i>

01:22:26.958 --> 01:22:28.000
I'm on it.

01:23:01.666 --> 01:23:02.875
Listen carefully.

01:23:06.125 --> 01:23:07.708
You're gonna get out of the car,

01:23:08.208 --> 01:23:09.791
and you're gonna do what I say.

01:23:10.333 --> 01:23:11.541
If you try to run,

01:23:12.958 --> 01:23:13.958
if you scream,

01:23:15.416 --> 01:23:17.291
I'll blow a hole in your head.

01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:21.583
Do you understand?

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.208
Get out of the car, Babi.

01:23:54.583 --> 01:23:57.458
- Fucking move!
- Oh, stop, Thiago. Stop.

01:24:04.375 --> 01:24:08.250
<i>Keep going straight and take</i>
<i>the next right. Marco, save Babi!</i>

01:24:16.541 --> 01:24:18.458
Thiago, there's no reason to do this.

01:24:20.625 --> 01:24:24.000
We can pretend we don't know.
I haven't told Marco anything yet.

01:24:24.083 --> 01:24:24.916
Walk.

01:24:27.125 --> 01:24:30.666
I saw the adulterated financial statements
and fake invoices, I saw it all.

01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:32.541
There's nothing to incriminate you.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Let me help you.

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:39.250
Let me help you get out of this.

01:24:39.333 --> 01:24:41.458
I want to get back at Caio, not you.

01:24:42.041 --> 01:24:43.833
You're my best friend, Thiago.

01:24:46.041 --> 01:24:49.291
You didn't mean any harm.
You got caught in Caio's lies, like I did.

01:24:49.375 --> 01:24:50.291
Shut up!

01:24:51.083 --> 01:24:52.333
Shut up, damn it!

01:24:53.916 --> 01:24:55.916
You don't know shit, okay?

01:25:13.125 --> 01:25:14.166
No.

01:25:14.250 --> 01:25:15.250
No.

01:25:25.416 --> 01:25:26.333
Hold this.

01:25:34.791 --> 01:25:36.125
Get in the grave.

01:25:36.708 --> 01:25:37.833
Get in the grave.

01:25:46.291 --> 01:25:48.625
Why are you doing this to me?

01:25:50.541 --> 01:25:52.250
I just wanted more money.

01:25:52.833 --> 01:25:54.750
Caio just wanted to fuck other women.

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:57.625
And you had to meddle, right?

01:25:58.416 --> 01:26:01.250
If I don't make you disappear,
they'll kill me.

01:26:01.333 --> 01:26:03.250
And that's why you're gonna die.

01:26:03.333 --> 01:26:04.291
No.

01:26:09.625 --> 01:26:10.875
You shoot.

01:26:12.041 --> 01:26:13.333
Fuck, Thiago.

01:26:14.666 --> 01:26:16.250
Didn't you wanna be part of the scheme?

01:26:16.875 --> 01:26:20.333
This is part of the scheme.
Anyone who knows too much ends up dead.

01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:23.375
I need to know you can finish this, Caio.

01:26:25.666 --> 01:26:26.791
It's her or us.

01:26:31.625 --> 01:26:32.541
Don't do it.

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:36.333
Don't do it.
Don't do it, Caio. Look at me.

01:26:38.250 --> 01:26:39.333
I love you.

01:26:39.416 --> 01:26:40.250
Shoot.

01:26:40.958 --> 01:26:42.250
Look at me, Caio.

01:26:43.875 --> 01:26:45.166
Fucking shoot!

01:26:48.291 --> 01:26:49.833
Fuck, I can't, Thiago.

01:26:50.416 --> 01:26:52.375
- Are you crazy, man?
- I can't.

01:26:52.458 --> 01:26:53.916
- We're gonna die!
- Fuck!

01:27:09.625 --> 01:27:11.083
Calm down, brother.

01:27:12.041 --> 01:27:13.125
Calm down. Easy…

01:27:14.416 --> 01:27:15.875
What did you do?

01:27:16.416 --> 01:27:17.666
Oh, Caio!

01:27:22.416 --> 01:27:23.375
What did I do?

01:27:24.125 --> 01:27:26.416
Look what you fucking made me do!

01:27:35.708 --> 01:27:36.541
Oh my God!

01:27:47.958 --> 01:27:49.125
Marco!

01:28:02.333 --> 01:28:05.000
Calm down. I'm putting it down.

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:12.541
It's over, Babi.

01:28:27.791 --> 01:28:28.833
Look at me.

01:28:28.916 --> 01:28:31.000
Stay here. Stay with me.

01:28:36.416 --> 01:28:39.500
<i>Two men were arrested</i>
<i>after trying to kill a woman</i>

01:28:39.583 --> 01:28:41.375
<i>just now, in the south of São Paulo.</i>

01:28:41.458 --> 01:28:44.208
<i>The criminals are Caio Siqueira</i>
<i>and Thiago Freitas.</i>

01:28:44.291 --> 01:28:48.541
<i>The victim, Bárbara Vieira, had found out</i>
<i>about a money-laundering scheme</i>

01:28:48.625 --> 01:28:52.125
<i>at the accounting office where she was</i>
<i>a partner with one of the criminals.</i>

01:28:52.208 --> 01:28:55.666
<i>The most intriguing part of this story</i>
<i>is that the judge handling the case…</i>

01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:56.958
It's gonna be okay.

01:28:57.041 --> 01:28:59.416
<i>…was at the scene</i>
<i>and allegedly prevented the murder.</i>

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.583
<i>What a story, huh?</i>

01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:07.375
AMBULANCE

01:29:10.833 --> 01:29:13.416
SIX MONTHS LATER

01:29:24.416 --> 01:29:26.083
<i>The doctors are really excited</i>.

01:29:26.166 --> 01:29:29.666
I think she's gonna be discharged
and come home this week.

01:29:30.541 --> 01:29:31.375
That's great.

01:29:32.375 --> 01:29:35.416
Vitória is so lucky
to be your daughter, you know?

01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:37.875
I am so lucky to be Vitória's dad.

01:29:39.416 --> 01:29:40.583
Oh, it's Paty.

01:29:42.083 --> 01:29:46.125
Hey, girl, how's the trip going?
Do you like the inn?

01:29:46.208 --> 01:29:49.083
<i>Girl, I'm loving it, for real.</i>
<i>Your recommendation was great.</i>

01:29:49.166 --> 01:29:51.666
So, girl, I have a bomb to drop on you.

01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:53.916
I didn't tell you before
because I wasn't sure.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.541
Say it already. I hate mysteries.

01:29:55.625 --> 01:29:58.375
After years of dragging myself
through the gutter,

01:29:58.458 --> 01:30:02.208
<i>kissing people all over São Paulo,</i>
<i>I've decided to settle down.</i>

01:30:02.291 --> 01:30:03.250
No way.

01:30:03.333 --> 01:30:05.125
I'm in a relationship.

01:30:05.208 --> 01:30:07.583
You're in a relationship? Are you serious?

01:30:07.666 --> 01:30:09.333
<i>- You don't believe me, do you?</i>
- No.

01:30:09.916 --> 01:30:12.208
<i>Come here. Remember him?</i>

01:30:12.291 --> 01:30:14.166
<i>Hey, how's it going?</i>

01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:17.000
From you-know-who's office?
I don't believe it!

01:30:17.583 --> 01:30:19.833
<i>Hi, how are you? Long time no see!</i>

01:30:20.708 --> 01:30:23.250
Girl, we're so happy, the three of us.

01:30:23.833 --> 01:30:24.708
Three?

01:30:24.791 --> 01:30:28.916
<i>The three of us. Me, Júnior, and Rodrigo.</i>

01:30:30.833 --> 01:30:34.666
Look, Paty,
I really have no idea what to do with you.

01:30:35.416 --> 01:30:37.208
We'll talk more later.

01:30:37.291 --> 01:30:38.916
Now I have a lot to--

01:30:39.416 --> 01:30:42.166
That's great,
I hope you all are very happy!

01:37:32.333 --> 01:37:37.333
