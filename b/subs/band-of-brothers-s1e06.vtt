02:29.774 --> 02:32.944
When we left for Bastogne,

02:33.027 --> 02:34.821
we were short of equipment,

02:34.904 --> 02:37.198
we didn't have
enough ammunition,

02:37.282 --> 02:39.909
we didn't have
enough warm clothes.

02:39.993 --> 02:43.037
But we had confidence

02:43.121 --> 02:46.124
that our higher
military authorities

02:46.207 --> 02:49.002
would get to us
whatever we needed.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.421
And there was a ridge
with a tree line.

02:51.504 --> 02:52.922
We were dug in on that ridge.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.133
The Germans knew
right where we were

02:55.216 --> 02:57.802
and they really
gave us a shellacking.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.387
Well, like in Bastogne,
we were down

02:59.470 --> 03:01.931
to one round per man
there for a while.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.934
There was this,
the fog was in,

03:05.018 --> 03:06.686
they couldn't drop us,
couldn't resupply us.

03:06.769 --> 03:09.522
Every time they tried
to drop supplies into us,

03:09.606 --> 03:12.817
they missed us and
dropped them to the Germans.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.736
One of the guys
got hit in the arm

03:14.819 --> 03:15.862
with a piece of shrapnel.

03:15.945 --> 03:17.989
Took his arm off
above the elbow.

03:18.072 --> 03:20.033
And they were
taking him out,

03:20.116 --> 03:22.410
he said, "Get my wristwatch
off of my arm."

03:22.493 --> 03:24.078
And then a medic
came along,

03:24.162 --> 03:25.747
and I think he really
saved my life,

03:25.830 --> 03:30.209
because he stuck a syrette
in a key position,

03:30.293 --> 03:32.045
more morphine.

03:32.128 --> 03:34.756
Even today,
a real cold night,

03:34.839 --> 03:39.260
we go to bed and my wife
will tell you that first thing
I'll say is,

03:39.344 --> 03:41.971
"I'm glad
I'm not in Bastogne."

03:50.063 --> 03:51.940
(wind blowing softly)

03:52.023 --> 03:55.068

07:05.716 --> 07:07.927
(vehicle approaching)

07:08.010 --> 07:09.846
Doc, bandage.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.140
Take him
back to regiment.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.561
As you all know,
General MacAuliffe,

07:16.644 --> 07:17.854
acting division commander.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.438
Give it to me
straight!

07:19.522 --> 07:21.649
We've been taking ground
in one position, General,

07:21.732 --> 07:23.734
losing it in another.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.319
And now it looks
like a stand-off,

07:25.403 --> 07:27.738
we're digging in on
the edge of the forest.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.199
We're under sporadic
artillery fire, General.

07:30.283 --> 07:33.744
We're taking a lot of hits,
and we have no aid station.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.538
We've run out of food,
we have no winter clothes,

07:35.621 --> 07:37.582
and we have little
or no ammo.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.375
The line's spread so thin,
the enemy wanders

07:39.458 --> 07:41.711
into our CP to use
our slit trenches, sir.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.921
We just can't
cover the line.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.174
Sink:
Good morning,
Captain Nixon.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.551
You got anything to add
for General MacAuliffe?

07:48.634 --> 07:52.054
General, ah, yes, sir.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.391
General, I took
a walk on our line

07:55.474 --> 07:58.186
about 0300 last night.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.730
Couldn't find the 501st
on our right flank.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.899
I tied in with a squad
from our Second Platoon,

08:02.982 --> 08:05.443
but, sir, we've got
some considerable gaps
in our perimeter.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.653
I don't have
enough people, sir.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.655
We're spread
too damn thin.

08:09.739 --> 08:13.492
Hold the line, Colonel.
Close the gaps.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.120
This goddamn fog
won't lift any time soon,

08:16.204 --> 08:18.372
so, you can forget
about air cover.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.458
Your First Battalion
just pulled out of Foy,

08:20.541 --> 08:22.210
Krauts on their tail.

08:22.293 --> 08:25.171
Tanks, artillery,
got no backup.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.798
There's a lot of shit
heading this way.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.359
Doc?

08:46.442 --> 08:49.237
Can I scrounge a bandage
from your aid kit, sir?

08:50.488 --> 08:52.240
How are you fixed?

08:53.491 --> 08:55.576
No plasma,
couple of bandages,

08:55.660 --> 08:57.453
practically no morphine.

08:57.536 --> 08:59.413
In fact, I tried to find
my way up to Third Battalion

08:59.497 --> 09:02.917
looking for supplies,
but... lost my way.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.962
If you can't get
over to Third,

09:06.045 --> 09:07.338
hook up with Doc Ryan.

09:07.421 --> 09:09.966
He'll fix you up with
what he has to spare.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.009
Thanks, Captain.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.554
Eugene...

09:15.638 --> 09:17.014
Get everything you can.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.225
You're gonna
need it.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.106
Spina.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.106
Doc.

09:25.189 --> 09:26.440
What's happening?

09:26.524 --> 09:28.401
We're digging in
right along the line.

09:28.484 --> 09:30.987
Yeah?

09:28.484 --> 09:30.987
Yeah, this is it.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.613
So, what'd you get?

09:32.697 --> 09:34.615
I got, uh,
I got this.

09:34.699 --> 09:38.995
And I got myself
a Kraut bandage.

09:45.584 --> 09:47.211
What? This is it?

09:47.295 --> 09:50.256
Yeah, that's it,
that's all you got.

09:50.339 --> 09:52.550
Jeez.

09:50.339 --> 09:52.550
(distant explosion)

09:56.762 --> 09:59.140
You know, First Battalion's
pulled out of Foy.

09:59.223 --> 10:00.725
Heavy casualties.

10:00.808 --> 10:03.519
So, if they're pulling back,
then what the hell
are we doing sitting here?

10:03.602 --> 10:05.730
We need morphine,
this is all I got.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.440
You got extra scissors?

10:07.523 --> 10:09.817
Uh-uh, just the one.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.110
Dike:
First Sergeant Lipton!

10:11.193 --> 10:12.778
Lipton:
Sir.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.697
What's this?

10:14.780 --> 10:16.407
Two medics
in one hole?

10:16.490 --> 10:17.742
Yes, sir.

10:17.825 --> 10:21.996
What's gonna happen to us
if you take a hit, huh?

10:22.079 --> 10:23.706
Sir?

10:23.789 --> 10:26.334
First Sergeant,
where's my foxhole?

10:27.918 --> 10:29.879
It's back here, sir.

10:29.962 --> 10:32.256
Maybe you missed it, huh?

10:32.340 --> 10:34.008
I'll walk you back, sir.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.218
You're a bit
close to the line here.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.137
Goddamn it.

10:44.852 --> 10:46.479
Sergeant Guarnere.

10:46.562 --> 10:48.105
Did you keep
your morphine from Holland?

10:48.189 --> 10:49.106
No.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.691
Hey, Doc,
I gotta talk to you.

10:50.775 --> 10:53.027
How's that leg?

10:50.775 --> 10:53.027
Oh, to hell with the leg.
I'm pissing needles.

10:53.110 --> 10:55.071
Later.

10:53.110 --> 10:55.071
(mutters) Shit.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.746
You seen 'em?

11:03.829 --> 11:05.289
No.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.166
But they're out there.

11:07.249 --> 11:08.668
Depend on it.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.630
Cup of joe, Doc?

11:09.835 --> 11:12.630
Gordon, I need scissors.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.507
You got scissors,
sharp scissors?

11:14.590 --> 11:16.133
Scissors?

11:14.590 --> 11:16.133
Uh-huh.

11:16.217 --> 11:19.637
Well, let's see. I'll have
to check the sewing room.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.347
Might be upstairs
in the study,

11:21.430 --> 11:23.432
that skinny old drawer
in the middle of the desk.

11:23.516 --> 11:27.269
All right. What about
an extra syrette in
your aid kit, huh?

11:27.353 --> 11:28.813
Hide your morphine,
guys--

11:31.148 --> 11:33.275
Muck, you all right?

11:31.148 --> 11:33.275
I'm good.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.611
Muck! Malarkey! Penkala!

11:35.694 --> 11:37.238
We're okay.

11:37.321 --> 11:40.074
Look at this shit!
They've peppered my helmet.

11:41.367 --> 11:44.412
Hey, Doc! Doc! Morphine.

11:44.495 --> 11:45.913
Here, take it!

11:45.996 --> 11:47.623
Where's Penkala?

11:47.706 --> 11:49.208
Christ knows.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.419
Man:
Medic!

11:57.174 --> 11:58.926
Doc!

12:02.012 --> 12:03.180
Medic!

12:03.264 --> 12:04.557
You guys hit?

12:04.640 --> 12:07.143
Doc, how you doing?

12:04.640 --> 12:07.143
Hey, are you crazy?

12:08.644 --> 12:11.439
What are you
looking at him for?
Watch the goddamn line.

12:11.522 --> 12:14.191
You got a syrette?

12:11.522 --> 12:14.191
Uh-uh. No.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.360
Man:
Medic!

12:16.444 --> 12:18.112
Go.

12:18.195 --> 12:19.905
Medic!

12:22.950 --> 12:24.910
Doc!

12:24.994 --> 12:26.328
Penkala.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.288
Doc!

12:27.371 --> 12:29.248
It's the artery,
I can feel it.

12:29.331 --> 12:31.167
Penkala, let go!

12:29.331 --> 12:31.167
It's the goddamn artery!

12:31.250 --> 12:33.169
Penkala, loosen your fingers,
goddamn it! Loosen them now!

12:33.252 --> 12:35.629
I'll bleed to death.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.629
Relax your arm,
Penky, come on!

12:35.713 --> 12:36.755
It's not the artery.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.507
I ain't going back, Doc.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.507
What?

12:38.591 --> 12:40.050
I ain't going nowhere,
not in this shit.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.344
You don't want
to go out in this shit
and you're yelling "medic"?

12:42.428 --> 12:44.472
I don't need to go
back to no aid station.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.348
Well, you're
in luck, Penkala.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.893
We don't got
no aid station.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.237
Penkala, scissors,
I need scissors.
You got scissors?

13:00.321 --> 13:01.780
What the hell
I need scissors for?

13:01.864 --> 13:03.324
Got your aid kit?

13:07.912 --> 13:10.206
Right. Well,
you don't need
this, not yet.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.832
I do.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.338
Who got hit?

13:15.461 --> 13:17.338
Penkala.

13:20.424 --> 13:22.885
All right, here. This is
what I want you to do.

13:22.968 --> 13:24.553
I want you to
take someone,
and work your way

13:24.637 --> 13:26.263
over to the
Third Battalion,
all right?

13:26.347 --> 13:27.640
You know what we need,
bandages, plasma.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.725
Whatever you
can beg, you beg.
All right?

13:29.808 --> 13:32.645
And get me
some goddamn scissors.
I can't get any.

13:32.728 --> 13:35.689
And you get yourself
a hot meal too, huh?

13:35.773 --> 13:37.441
Go.

13:58.128 --> 14:00.381
You know, he told me
he was a goddamn virgin.

14:00.464 --> 14:01.840
Who?

14:01.924 --> 14:04.218
The replacement
in my foxhole, Julian.

14:04.301 --> 14:05.594
Yeah?

14:07.555 --> 14:09.515
Goddamn virgin,
just a kid.

14:10.849 --> 14:13.852
The only virgin I know
is the Virgin Mary.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.233
Hey, Babe,
where the hell are we?

14:20.317 --> 14:22.027
This way.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.989
I don't like it.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.950
Where the hell's
Third Battalion?

14:29.159 --> 14:31.495
Shit. Come on.

14:31.579 --> 14:34.081
(men speaking German)

14:34.164 --> 14:36.417
Come on, come on.
Give me a hand.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.252
Go, go!

14:36.500 --> 14:38.252
<i>Scheisse!</i>

14:39.753 --> 14:41.297
Come on, Spina, move!

14:41.380 --> 14:45.092
I'm moving.
Keep moving!
Come on, go.

14:45.175 --> 14:47.761
Okay, we can spare
a few bandages, but that's it.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.138
No morphine.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.390
You're gonna have to go
back to Bastogne for plasma.

14:51.473 --> 14:53.142
Bastogne? It took us
an hour to find you.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.893
Doesn't your surgeon
have plasma?

14:54.977 --> 14:57.771
We don't have one, no surgeon,
no aid station, nothing.

14:57.855 --> 14:58.856
Just me
and my buddy.

14:58.939 --> 15:01.275
Sorry, guys,
but we just can't help you.

15:01.358 --> 15:03.235
Man:
Take cover!

15:05.863 --> 15:07.906
Get your butts out of here,
we're pulling back!

15:07.990 --> 15:09.450
Come on, let's go!

15:09.533 --> 15:10.492
Go, go, go!

15:10.576 --> 15:11.744
Move!

15:11.827 --> 15:13.245
Should have shot Hinkle
in the ass.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.581
Hinkle nearly shot him
in the ass!

15:17.458 --> 15:20.044
Hey. God bless you.

15:20.127 --> 15:23.297
(chattering)

15:24.548 --> 15:25.883
Yo, these smell
like my armpit.

15:25.966 --> 15:27.176
At least
your armpit's warm.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.969
Do you want syrup
with that?

15:29.053 --> 15:31.013
Hey, Joe, be honest,
what's in these things
anyway, huh?

15:31.096 --> 15:32.473
Nothing you
won't eat, Malarkey.

15:32.556 --> 15:33.641
I won't eat Malarkey.

15:33.724 --> 15:36.352
Hey, hey, maybe Hinkle
would like your share, huh?

15:36.435 --> 15:38.145
I should have shot him
when I had the chance.

15:38.228 --> 15:39.229
What, running
backwards, Babe?

15:39.313 --> 15:41.649
Anybody see Lieutenant Dike?

15:41.732 --> 15:44.485
Try Battalion CP, sir.

15:44.568 --> 15:45.611
Try Paris.

15:45.694 --> 15:46.820
Try Hinkle.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.156
Hinkle, sweetie,
I'm home.

15:49.239 --> 15:52.826
Hey, Eugene, Lieutenant Dike's
got a full aid kit, try him.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.161
Yeah, I'm sure
he's not using his.

15:54.244 --> 15:56.121
Maybe Hinkle's
got a syrette for you.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.247
Eat your strudel.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.750
Hey, Hinkle-vinkle,
eat the armpit, huh?

16:08.801 --> 16:10.427
Lieutenant Dike.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.096
Lieutenant.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.099
Can you spare something
from your aid kit, sir?

16:15.182 --> 16:16.684
I'm real short,
I need syrettes.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.435
What, morphine?

16:16.767 --> 16:18.435
Yes, sir.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.020
All right.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.020
Please.

16:23.732 --> 16:26.485
What happens
if I get hit?

16:26.568 --> 16:29.113
I'll be there, sir.

16:29.196 --> 16:30.698
Syrette's in here, right?

16:30.781 --> 16:31.949
Yes, it is.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.867
Here.

16:33.951 --> 16:35.077
I don't plan
on getting hit.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.995
Thank you, sir.

16:37.079 --> 16:40.082
(coughing)

16:41.583 --> 16:42.751
Heffron.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.503
Hey, Heffron,
you okay?

16:45.671 --> 16:48.090
Gene, what is with
the Heffron bullshit, huh?

16:48.173 --> 16:50.008
You know my name,
why don't you use it?

16:50.092 --> 16:52.094
It's Edward, right?

16:52.177 --> 16:53.512
Edward,
are you serious?

16:53.595 --> 16:55.431
Only the goddamn nuns
call me Edward.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.058
Hey, listen,
I need to know whether

16:58.142 --> 16:59.518
you kept your morphine
from Holland.

16:59.601 --> 17:02.229
No. You asked me already,
remember?

17:02.312 --> 17:05.107
No, I don't recall.

17:14.450 --> 17:15.576
Hey.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.412
Hey.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.916
Gordon, you want me?

17:23.917 --> 17:25.627
Oh, yeah, morphine.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.047
Third Platoon ponied up
the contraband.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.799
You still looking
for scissors?

17:30.883 --> 17:32.134
Yes, I am.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.469
Perconte.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.180
Perconte. Yeah.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.639
Doc.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.308
Thank you.

17:40.476 --> 17:43.061
Oh, and you better check
on Joe Toye out on the OP.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.314
He's missing something.

17:47.441 --> 17:48.942
Thanks.

18:02.039 --> 18:02.956
You guys okay?

18:03.040 --> 18:05.501
They got hot food.
Can you smell it?

18:05.584 --> 18:07.044
Toye, are you
missing something?

18:07.127 --> 18:08.128
Home.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.005
Ask him to dance, Doc.

18:10.088 --> 18:12.716
(distant rapid gunfire)

18:12.800 --> 18:14.176
Toye, show me your feet.

18:14.259 --> 18:17.387
You watch
the goddamn line, McClung.

18:18.722 --> 18:20.808
Where are your boots?

18:20.891 --> 18:22.851
In Washington,
up General Taylor's ass.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.144
I don't believe this.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.522
I can move better
in bare feet, Doc.

18:26.605 --> 18:27.648
What happened?

18:27.731 --> 18:30.234
I took 'em off,
drying my goddamn socks.

18:30.317 --> 18:32.069
They got
blown to hell, okay?

18:32.152 --> 18:33.695
Well, what's your size?

18:33.779 --> 18:37.074
Nine, just like
everybody else.

18:42.412 --> 18:44.164
Frank, you keep
cleaning those teeth,

18:44.248 --> 18:46.750
the Germans will
see you a mile away.
Shoot you dead.

18:46.834 --> 18:50.212
That's right, Pee Wee,
you keep laughing.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.755
Hey, Doc.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.674
Doc. My stuff.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.300
Oh, come on, Doc.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.010
What, you got
a drugstore in here?

18:57.094 --> 18:58.595
No, I own my stuff.

18:58.679 --> 19:01.056
What are
you looking for?

19:01.139 --> 19:03.725
Scissors.
Thank you, Perconte.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.270
Perconte:
My goddamn scissors!

19:08.397 --> 19:09.523
Sergeant Guarnere.

19:09.606 --> 19:11.149
Marlene, is that you?

19:11.233 --> 19:12.818
Hey, Doc.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.153
Doc, come here.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.988
USO pickin' up syrettes!

19:16.071 --> 19:17.531
Alley, Liebgott,
you got any?

19:17.614 --> 19:18.824
No, got used
in Holland, Doc.

19:18.907 --> 19:20.367
You ain't using this stuff,
are you, Doc?

19:20.450 --> 19:22.202
I mean personal, like?

19:20.450 --> 19:22.202
Come on.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.328
(singing)

19:23.412 --> 19:25.789
Hey, Doc,
I still got the itchin'.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.541
Every time I pee
it's murder.

19:27.624 --> 19:30.544
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry,
But I just don't have
penicillin for your pirouette.

19:30.627 --> 19:31.628
My what?

19:31.712 --> 19:33.255
Lieutenant, make sure
you move around a little.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.132
Get your blood flowing.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.132
I can't feel my feet.

19:35.215 --> 19:37.885
Yeah, well, that's why
you gotta move around,
so you don't get trench foot.

19:37.968 --> 19:39.344
Should I take
my boots off?

19:39.428 --> 19:41.680
Uh-uh, all you gotta do
is just loosen 'em up.
Keep moving.

19:41.763 --> 19:43.390
Sergeant, I'm sorry.

19:43.473 --> 19:46.226
Look, I know it must be hell,
but I can't help you.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.103
Just drink lots of water.

19:48.186 --> 19:49.897
Water, it's pissing
that hurts!

19:49.980 --> 19:51.690
Shut it!
Shut the hell up!

19:52.649 --> 19:54.109
What's going
on here, Bill?

19:54.192 --> 19:56.987
Who the hell's singing?

19:54.192 --> 19:56.987
I'll find out, Lieutenant.

19:57.070 --> 19:59.197
I'll find out,
I'll shut 'em up.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.544
(rapid gunfire)

20:17.466 --> 20:19.551
(quietly) Oh Lord, grant
that I shall never seek

20:19.635 --> 20:21.970
so much to be consoled,
as to console,

20:22.054 --> 20:25.182
to be understood,
as to understand,

20:25.265 --> 20:27.142
or to be loved,

20:27.225 --> 20:30.562
as to love
with all my heart.

20:33.523 --> 20:35.734
With all my heart.

20:37.444 --> 20:38.779
(explosion echoes)

20:38.862 --> 20:41.782
Man:
Medic!

20:44.201 --> 20:46.078
Medic! Medic!

20:47.412 --> 20:48.413
(screams)

20:48.497 --> 20:49.873
Oh, Christ!

20:49.957 --> 20:51.250
Perconte,
you getting a jeep?

20:51.333 --> 20:52.459
I'm on it, Doc.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.002
Look what they
did to my leg!

20:54.086 --> 20:56.171
Perconte:
Easy CP. Easy CP.
This is Perconte.

20:56.254 --> 20:58.548
Sisk has been hit
and I need a jeep.

20:58.632 --> 21:01.093
I say it again,
I need a jeep now!

21:02.135 --> 21:04.388
Move it, goddamn it!
We need it now!

21:04.471 --> 21:06.682
(explosions)

21:06.765 --> 21:08.600
(whimpering)

21:10.769 --> 21:12.938
Okay, Sisk, ain't that bad,
ain't that bad.

21:13.021 --> 21:14.898
Ain't that bad?

21:19.194 --> 21:20.988
(screams)

21:21.071 --> 21:23.156
One pull!

21:21.071 --> 21:23.156
(yells)

21:23.240 --> 21:25.158
No, Doc, save the morphine,
I can make it.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.743
I can make it.
Save it, okay?

21:26.827 --> 21:29.079
Okay, all right,
let's get him out of here.

21:29.162 --> 21:31.540
(groaning)

21:35.836 --> 21:37.212
Where's the goddamn jeep?

21:37.295 --> 21:38.547
I don't know,
but I hear it.

21:38.630 --> 21:42.718
(screaming)
Jesus Christ!

21:42.801 --> 21:44.720
Oh, Skinny, you've got blood
all over my trousers.

21:44.803 --> 21:45.887
I'm real sorry, Frank.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.014
Get him up.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.227
Damn it, skinny.

21:53.895 --> 21:55.647
Tell Spina
I went in for plasma.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.482
Get him up.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.198
All the tanks,
artillery,

22:05.282 --> 22:06.491
Are pulled back to here.

22:06.575 --> 22:09.828
We've got no back-up
beyond Bastogne, this is it.

22:09.911 --> 22:13.540
The krauts captured
the 326th medical
and they took everybody.

22:13.623 --> 22:16.084
Doctors, medics,
the whole shebang.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.295
We got nothin'.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.802
They're giving the boys
hooch for the pain.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.346
Aaah!

22:27.429 --> 22:28.722
He took a mortar hit,
watch the leg.

22:28.805 --> 22:30.724
Yeah, watch the leg.

22:30.807 --> 22:31.808
Get him in.

22:40.567 --> 22:41.610
Move it!

22:41.693 --> 22:42.652
Coming through.

22:42.736 --> 22:45.405
Morning fellas.

22:53.455 --> 22:56.875
Oh, no, no, no, here,
put him here.

22:56.958 --> 22:58.126
Man:
Yes, ma'am.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.419
Aaah.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.129
Is he bad?

23:01.213 --> 23:03.632
No, lower leg wound,
no morphine.

23:07.052 --> 23:09.971
Nurse, have you got
plasma I can--

23:10.055 --> 23:11.056
Wait, please.

23:42.379 --> 23:43.839
Hey, what's going on here?

23:43.922 --> 23:45.507
why aren't
these men evacuated?

23:45.590 --> 23:47.175
We can't evacuate,
we're cut off.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.845
This is as far
as it goes.

23:56.685 --> 23:59.521
Renee:
<i>Faites attention</i>
<i>des plasma.</i>

24:08.238 --> 24:09.364
<i>Ca va?</i>

24:09.447 --> 24:12.576
<i>Ce n'est pas grave,</i>
<i>ce n'est pas urgent.</i>

24:15.078 --> 24:17.998
I'm in heaven, Doc.

24:18.081 --> 24:19.583
<i>Pas encore, de merci.</i>

24:19.666 --> 24:20.625
Nurse?

24:20.709 --> 24:22.586
This way.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.047
I need morphine,
I need bandages,

24:26.131 --> 24:28.008
Whatever you've got.

24:30.468 --> 24:33.597
Okay, I can give you
a little, but not a lot.

24:34.681 --> 24:35.724
There you go.

24:35.807 --> 24:38.476
You can have this,
do you want that?

24:38.560 --> 24:40.520
Oui, you got plasma?

24:40.604 --> 24:41.771
A little.

24:41.855 --> 24:43.523
Are you a surgeon?

24:43.607 --> 24:44.858
No, we don't
got no surgeon.

24:44.941 --> 24:46.568
What's this?

24:46.651 --> 24:48.486
Er, from the bed.

24:48.570 --> 24:49.487
What, sheets?

24:49.571 --> 24:51.114
Yes, for bandages.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.365
Okay.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.329
Voila.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.329
Merci.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.625
<i>Comment vous</i>

25:01.708 --> 25:04.169
My name is Renee.

25:04.252 --> 25:06.087
I'm Gene,
Eugene Roe.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.256
Where are you from?

25:08.340 --> 25:10.133
Louisiana, half Cajun.

25:10.217 --> 25:13.178
<i>Et toi,</i>
<i>d'ou viens tu?</i>

25:13.261 --> 25:14.679
Bastogne.

25:21.728 --> 25:23.980
Can you get me
back to the line?

25:24.064 --> 25:25.815
Sure.

25:31.238 --> 25:32.822
Eugene.

25:35.617 --> 25:37.911
<i>Chocolat.</i>

25:37.994 --> 25:40.330

26:06.231 --> 26:08.400
Maloney:
Fight well for your god
and your country.

26:08.483 --> 26:11.361
God bless you all,
and stay safe.

26:11.444 --> 26:14.072
That's it, guys,
nothing more to worry about.

26:14.155 --> 26:17.033
We're gonna die now,
we're gonna die in
a state of grace.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.536
Isn't that right, Babe?

26:19.619 --> 26:22.163
Battalion want
a reconnaissance patrol.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.456
Kraut hunting.

26:23.540 --> 26:24.791
All right, I'll go,
take these.

26:24.874 --> 26:28.795
Give the boots to Joe Toye,
tell him they're a nine.

26:35.677 --> 26:37.721
Keep going, till we make
some kind of contact.

26:37.804 --> 26:39.347
Peacock's leading, right?

26:39.431 --> 26:40.515
Right.

26:40.598 --> 26:42.517
Asshole couldn't find
a snowball in a blizzard.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.602
That's what's happening,
that's the order.

26:44.686 --> 26:46.187
Sarge?

26:44.686 --> 26:46.187
Yeah, Julian.

26:46.271 --> 26:48.356
Let me be
the lead scout.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.774
Back in line,
Private.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.651
All right, that's it,
let's move out.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.361
Tactical columns,
gentlemen.

26:53.445 --> 26:54.988
Doc, Doc,
it's a combat patrol.

26:55.071 --> 26:56.364
Why don't
you stay back

26:56.448 --> 26:57.991
And keep your ass
out of trouble, huh?

26:58.074 --> 26:59.784
Yes, sergeant.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.036
Yeah.

27:06.124 --> 27:08.710
Martin:
Come on, Hoobler,
pick it up.

27:23.808 --> 27:26.311
(explosion)

27:30.315 --> 27:31.816
Right, move up.

27:41.326 --> 27:42.911
Go.

27:44.287 --> 27:45.580
Fire!

27:45.663 --> 27:47.665
Get down!
Get down!

27:48.917 --> 27:50.085
Jesus.

27:51.753 --> 27:53.004
Shit!

27:56.674 --> 27:58.426
Bull!
Christenson!

27:58.510 --> 28:01.679
Up on line!

28:08.853 --> 28:10.313
Johnny!

28:10.397 --> 28:12.607
We got a man down!

28:14.317 --> 28:16.653
Jack, over here.

28:16.736 --> 28:17.737
What have we got?

28:17.821 --> 28:19.155
Keep still, Julian!

28:19.239 --> 28:20.657
We've gotta
make a move!

28:20.740 --> 28:21.699
I can get him, sarge.

28:21.783 --> 28:24.411
Suppressing fire!

28:24.494 --> 28:25.703
Suppressing fire!

28:25.787 --> 28:27.580
One man down, easy!

28:27.664 --> 28:29.332
Covering fire!

28:29.416 --> 28:31.459
(shouting)

28:34.045 --> 28:38.216
Easy CP,
I have one man down!

28:42.887 --> 28:45.223
Okay, stay there,
don't move.

28:45.306 --> 28:47.600
Stop moving else
they'll keep shootin'.

28:48.685 --> 28:50.520
(gunshots)

28:56.192 --> 28:57.110
What's happening, sir?

28:57.193 --> 28:59.737
We're pulling back,
we made contact.

28:59.821 --> 29:02.574
I gotta get
to the CP.

29:08.204 --> 29:09.330
Don't move!

29:09.414 --> 29:12.375
Stop moving,
they'll keep firing,
stop moving!

29:12.459 --> 29:15.295
Jesus Christ, fuck.

29:15.378 --> 29:16.421
John, what--?

29:16.504 --> 29:20.091
Pull back,
we gotta pull back!

29:21.426 --> 29:22.677
Let's get the hell
out of here!

29:22.760 --> 29:24.220
Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

29:24.304 --> 29:25.263
Move!

29:25.346 --> 29:26.347
Go!

29:26.431 --> 29:30.018
Stay with us,
stay with us!

29:30.101 --> 29:31.686
Hold on, Julian,
stay with us!

29:31.769 --> 29:33.897
Look at me,
stay with us!

29:33.980 --> 29:35.148
Look at me,
hold on, hold on!

29:35.231 --> 29:38.026
Don't move, Julian,
we're coming back!

29:38.109 --> 29:40.361
We'll get you out of here,
just hold on!

29:40.445 --> 29:42.697
Go, let's go!

29:45.408 --> 29:47.952
(gunshots)

29:54.417 --> 29:55.710
Man:
On me, move!

29:55.793 --> 29:57.795
Come on, let's go!

29:57.879 --> 29:59.130
Where the hell
are we?!

29:59.214 --> 30:01.216
Man:
Straight ahead!
Straight ahead!

30:03.635 --> 30:05.011
Doc!

30:05.094 --> 30:06.346
Doc!

30:06.429 --> 30:10.808
Man:
Okay, Christenson,
set it up on the rock.

30:10.892 --> 30:14.646
Luz:
Easy CP, Easy CP,
Lightning, over.

30:14.729 --> 30:17.524
I need an "A" jeep
standing by at the CP.

30:17.607 --> 30:20.485
Okay, got you
a jeep, Doc.

30:20.568 --> 30:21.986
Martin!

30:22.070 --> 30:23.071
Martin!

30:23.154 --> 30:25.114
Martin: Sir!

30:23.154 --> 30:25.114
What's going on?!

30:25.198 --> 30:26.324
They got Julian!

30:26.407 --> 30:27.325
He's still alive!

30:27.408 --> 30:28.368
We don't
know that!

30:28.451 --> 30:29.702
We've gotta
go get him, sir!

30:29.786 --> 30:31.246
Did you hit an OP
Or their line?

30:31.329 --> 30:32.455
Their line, sir!

30:32.539 --> 30:34.374
We've gotta go back, sir,
get Julian out of there!

30:34.457 --> 30:35.375
No, fall back!

30:35.458 --> 30:36.459
Man:
we lost Peacock.

30:36.543 --> 30:37.835
No, he's back
at the CP.

30:37.919 --> 30:39.420
Nixon:
Come on, Martin,
fall back!

30:39.504 --> 30:40.672
Get him
out of here!

30:40.755 --> 30:44.259
Let's up and go!

30:44.342 --> 30:45.760
(gunshots)

30:45.843 --> 30:47.971
Luz:
Doc, we've gotta move now,
Doc, come on, let's go!

30:48.054 --> 30:51.099
Doc, now,
let's go!

30:54.561 --> 30:55.603
Martin:
Move!

30:55.687 --> 30:57.355
Let's go!

30:57.438 --> 30:59.148
Fall back!

31:03.653 --> 31:05.363
(coughing)

31:13.705 --> 31:15.582
We couldn't get
to him, Captain.

31:15.665 --> 31:19.127
We tried, Babe tried,
we couldn't get to him.

31:30.597 --> 31:32.515
Hey, people.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.559
Let me sit in here
with you guys.

31:35.810 --> 31:37.562
(coughing)

32:25.193 --> 32:27.445
Heffron?

32:27.528 --> 32:29.155
Toye.

32:30.657 --> 32:34.077
What you
doing out here?

32:34.160 --> 32:37.497
Thanks for the boots, Doc,
doing fine.

32:37.580 --> 32:40.708
Are you still having trouble
with your feet?

32:42.460 --> 32:45.296
Show me,
let me see it.

32:59.686 --> 33:01.813
It's trench foot,
Toye.

33:01.896 --> 33:04.857
If it turns gangrene,
you could lose it.

33:04.941 --> 33:07.485
I ain't coming off
the line, Doc.

33:09.904 --> 33:13.574
Well, you gotta
stay dry.

33:13.658 --> 33:15.535
Massage your feet.

33:15.618 --> 33:19.038
Change socks every day,
and dry the wet ones
around your neck.

33:19.122 --> 33:20.081
Try.

33:20.164 --> 33:21.165
Do it.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.000
I'm working on it.

33:28.756 --> 33:30.967
Oh, you seen
Heffron?

33:31.050 --> 33:32.218
No.

33:32.301 --> 33:33.428
Why?

33:33.511 --> 33:35.930
He ain't
in his hole.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.893
Fuck.

33:52.405 --> 33:54.282
Got you.

34:02.039 --> 34:03.583
Heffron?

34:13.551 --> 34:15.386
Edward.

34:17.805 --> 34:19.557
Eat it.

34:25.188 --> 34:26.981
Good.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.820
Perfect.

34:37.575 --> 34:40.536
I promised him,
if he got hit,

34:40.620 --> 34:46.125
I'd get his stuff and bring it
to his ma, you know?

34:49.086 --> 34:51.964
Now the fucking krauts
will strip him.

34:52.048 --> 34:53.508
Hey, no,
it's okay.

34:53.591 --> 34:54.634
It's not!

34:54.717 --> 34:56.803
It's not okay.

34:56.886 --> 35:00.473
We should've
got to him.

35:07.063 --> 35:09.732
(coughing)

35:22.245 --> 35:24.455
(gunshots)

35:33.464 --> 35:36.467
Hey, what do you call
those people again?

35:36.551 --> 35:38.135
Those Cajun
healers?

35:38.219 --> 35:40.263
<i>Traiteurs.</i>

35:40.346 --> 35:44.517
You know, my grandma
was a traiteurs.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.435
Uh-huh.
Your grandmother?

35:46.519 --> 35:48.062
No shit?

35:48.145 --> 35:49.188
Well, she was.

35:49.272 --> 35:51.691
Laid her hands
on people and cured 'em.

35:51.774 --> 35:57.738
Took away sickness, cancer,
you name it.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.365
Your grandma
did that?

35:59.448 --> 36:01.492
Wow, you're
shitting me.

36:01.576 --> 36:04.287
I remember she used
to pray a lot.

36:04.370 --> 36:06.122
Yeah, I guess
she had to.

36:06.205 --> 36:09.917
Talked to God about the pain
she pulled out.

36:11.168 --> 36:13.296
Asked him to...

36:13.379 --> 36:15.756
carry it away.

36:19.969 --> 36:22.930
That's what
she did.

36:24.181 --> 36:25.600
Jesus.

36:25.683 --> 36:28.728
I'm still trying to figure why
they picked me for a medic.

36:28.811 --> 36:30.771
God knows.

36:30.855 --> 36:35.568
Snap of a finger and just like
that you're a medic.

36:36.944 --> 36:39.989
I've had enough
playing doctor.

36:43.075 --> 36:45.119
Hey, how about you?

36:56.339 --> 36:58.257
(distant explosion)

37:11.395 --> 37:13.898
Joe.

37:13.981 --> 37:16.442
Joe.

37:46.722 --> 37:48.891
(airplane flying overhead)

37:53.229 --> 37:55.564
(cheering)

37:58.734 --> 38:00.611
(gunshots)

38:24.760 --> 38:26.262
Cease fire!

38:26.345 --> 38:27.805
Cease fire,
goddamn it!

38:27.888 --> 38:30.683
Sergeant, I don't understand,
it was our own planes.

38:30.766 --> 38:31.767
Shh!

38:33.227 --> 38:34.729
C-47's.

38:34.812 --> 38:38.149
They're bringing supplies,
it's a drop.

38:38.232 --> 38:39.817
It's a drop,
come on!

39:16.520 --> 39:18.606
Lipton:
all right, help the doc.

39:18.689 --> 39:20.941
The rest of you
come with me.

39:32.995 --> 39:34.330
Man:
medic!

39:34.413 --> 39:35.706
Someone give us
a hand here!

39:35.790 --> 39:38.876
Help, help!

39:41.504 --> 39:42.797
Renee:
This one through here.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.716
Now,<i> vite!</i>

39:53.724 --> 39:56.602
Renee:
<i>La pression est se</i>
<i>trouve a l'artere.</i>

39:56.685 --> 39:57.603
<i>Oui, d'accord.</i>

39:57.686 --> 40:01.982
The artery,
gotta find the artery.

40:08.781 --> 40:10.783
<i>Moi, je ne</i>
<i>la trouve pas!</i>

40:14.912 --> 40:16.497
Anna!

40:24.964 --> 40:26.757
Anna!

40:33.389 --> 40:35.391
<i>Je ne la trouve pas!</i>

41:36.535 --> 41:38.913
Where does
she come from?

41:39.997 --> 41:42.833
The black girl?

41:45.836 --> 41:47.922
The Congo.

41:48.005 --> 41:51.759
How'd she
get here?

41:51.842 --> 41:55.471
Just like me.

41:55.554 --> 41:57.681
She came to help.

42:10.402 --> 42:12.238
Chocolat?

42:27.962 --> 42:30.005
Hmm.

42:31.257 --> 42:32.633
What?

42:32.716 --> 42:36.637
Your hands.

42:39.640 --> 42:41.225
My hands?

42:39.640 --> 42:41.225
Mm-hmm.

42:45.396 --> 42:47.898
You're a
good nurse.

42:54.280 --> 42:56.532
No.

42:56.615 --> 43:00.244
I never want to treat
another wounded man again.

43:00.327 --> 43:02.913
I'd rather work
in a butcher's shop.

43:06.709 --> 43:09.837
But your touch...

43:09.920 --> 43:12.256
calms people.

43:13.757 --> 43:15.509
That's a gift
from God.

43:15.592 --> 43:17.886
No, it's not a gift.

43:17.970 --> 43:21.640
God would never give
such a painful thing.

43:34.069 --> 43:35.863
Man:
nurse!

43:35.946 --> 43:37.823
Nurse!

43:38.949 --> 43:41.201
We need some help
over here!

43:41.285 --> 43:44.872
Guy's shot
through the stomach.

43:44.955 --> 43:46.665
Renee:
how bad is it?

43:47.750 --> 43:50.502
Okay, get this one
in first.

43:56.800 --> 43:58.552
Man:
you'll be all right.

44:21.033 --> 44:23.410
Compton:
Now we know how they felt.

44:23.494 --> 44:25.663
What?
Who?

44:25.746 --> 44:27.873
The Legionnaires.

44:27.956 --> 44:30.501
When they were
watching the Huns,

44:30.584 --> 44:33.128
the Goths,
the Visigoths.

44:33.212 --> 44:35.422
Visigoths?
Jesus Christ.

44:35.506 --> 44:37.549
Uh, barbarians.

44:37.633 --> 44:39.259
Ah.

44:39.343 --> 44:41.428
They came right
through here.

44:41.512 --> 44:44.807
Right through these trees,
just sweeping down

44:44.890 --> 44:47.267
to burn the shit
out of Rome.

44:47.351 --> 44:50.312
That's a hell of
a long ride.

44:50.396 --> 44:54.942
So what, what's
college like, Buck?

44:55.025 --> 44:56.652
You got time
to hit the books

44:56.735 --> 44:59.154
with cheerleaders
running their fingers
through your hair?

45:01.073 --> 45:05.327
Hell, Babe,
I can't even remember.

45:05.411 --> 45:07.746
(Gunshot)

45:10.833 --> 45:13.210
Hey, it's Doc.

45:10.833 --> 45:13.210
Sergeant.

45:13.293 --> 45:15.421
Heffron.
Lieutenant.

45:15.504 --> 45:17.965
Wrap up.

45:19.341 --> 45:22.302
Never calls anybody
by their nickname.

45:22.386 --> 45:24.346
He once
called me Edward.

45:24.430 --> 45:25.514
Is that right?

45:25.597 --> 45:27.224
Edward?

45:27.307 --> 45:28.934
That's your name?

45:29.017 --> 45:29.935
Yeah.

45:30.018 --> 45:34.606
Funny, you don't look
like an Edward.

45:39.695 --> 45:41.780
(Coughing)

45:50.497 --> 45:54.168
(Wind blowing)

46:05.179 --> 46:09.099
(Tanks rumbling)

46:16.982 --> 46:18.484
Hey, Doc.

46:18.567 --> 46:20.611
It's gonna get
busy, pal.

46:21.653 --> 46:22.654
Hold your fire, boys.

46:22.738 --> 46:23.822
Don't let 'em
draw you out.

46:23.906 --> 46:25.073
Man:
Hold your fire!

46:25.157 --> 46:26.241
Stay ready, boys.

46:26.325 --> 46:28.368
What the hell are we gonna hit
those things with, Lip?

46:28.452 --> 46:29.953
Hold your fire.

46:30.037 --> 46:31.622
Get ready, Walter.

46:31.705 --> 46:33.999
(Explosion)

46:34.082 --> 46:35.834
Man:
Stay in your holes, guys.

46:39.630 --> 46:41.882
(Gasping)

46:41.965 --> 46:44.384
Man:
Smokey's hit, medic!

46:44.468 --> 46:46.470
Hey, Eugene, let's go!

46:46.553 --> 46:48.639
Come on, let's go!

46:48.722 --> 46:49.765
Okay, go!

46:51.600 --> 46:52.684
Ready.

46:54.811 --> 46:56.438
Medic!

46:59.441 --> 47:00.526
Doc!

47:00.609 --> 47:01.568
Smokey!

47:01.652 --> 47:02.486
Hi, Mo.

47:02.569 --> 47:03.737
I got it,
I'm keeping it for you.

47:03.820 --> 47:04.821
Smoke!

47:04.905 --> 47:06.573
I can't feel
my legs, Gene.

47:04.905 --> 47:06.573
Take it easy.

47:06.657 --> 47:08.242
My foxhole,
get the plasma, now!

47:08.325 --> 47:09.618
Here they come!

47:09.701 --> 47:12.412
(Tanks rumbling)

47:15.082 --> 47:16.542
You got 'em?

47:15.082 --> 47:16.542
I got 'em, go!

47:16.625 --> 47:19.044
Machine gun open fire!

47:37.688 --> 47:40.732
Open fire, left!

47:54.329 --> 47:55.872
Sergeant Lipton!

48:00.711 --> 48:03.338
Doc, we gotta get
the hell out of here.

48:04.840 --> 48:06.633
Stay with us Smokey.

48:06.717 --> 48:08.218
Stay with us!

48:09.428 --> 48:11.430
We gotta get
the hell out of here!

48:12.639 --> 48:14.391
(Machine gun firing)

48:14.474 --> 48:15.809
You ready?

48:15.892 --> 48:17.686
All right, go!

48:26.820 --> 48:28.071
Stop,
we've gotta stop.

48:28.155 --> 48:29.156
All right.

48:32.200 --> 48:34.453
Take the plasma.

48:32.200 --> 48:34.453
All right.

48:34.536 --> 48:38.457
Hey, hey,
come on, Walt.

48:38.540 --> 48:41.251
Come on, buddy.

48:41.335 --> 48:43.253
Hurry, Doc,
come on, Doc.

48:43.337 --> 48:44.671
I've gotta get
back to the line.

48:44.755 --> 48:46.256
Okay, okay.

48:46.340 --> 48:47.758
Lip?

48:47.841 --> 48:48.675
Yeah, buddy.

48:48.759 --> 48:50.218
You're standing
on my hand.

48:50.302 --> 48:52.846
Sorry, bud.

48:54.056 --> 48:56.767
Look, I'll get you another
purple heart for it.

48:56.850 --> 48:57.934
Hey!

48:59.311 --> 49:01.480
Hey!

49:01.563 --> 49:04.107
Hey, give us a hand.

49:05.275 --> 49:07.653
I got you a ride, Doc.

49:19.539 --> 49:21.124
Jones!

49:24.461 --> 49:25.671
Give it here.

49:25.754 --> 49:27.547
Okay, put him here.

49:28.924 --> 49:30.634
Where's his tag?

49:30.717 --> 49:32.636
Where's his tag?
What's wrong with him?

49:32.719 --> 49:34.763
Paralyzed.

49:34.846 --> 49:36.098
What?

49:36.181 --> 49:38.725
He's paralyzed.

49:38.809 --> 49:41.103
Can't feel a thing.

49:48.735 --> 49:50.195
In the name
of the father,

49:50.278 --> 49:51.738
of the son,
and of the holy spirit,

49:51.822 --> 49:53.907
Amen.

50:03.709 --> 50:05.043
Eugene?

50:06.586 --> 50:07.754
Eugene?

50:07.838 --> 50:09.256
Man: Renee!

50:12.300 --> 50:13.802
Are you...

50:13.885 --> 50:16.054
Man:
Renee, I need
some help here.

50:16.138 --> 50:18.348
Are you all right?

50:18.432 --> 50:20.392
Man:
Renee!

50:35.949 --> 50:38.452
(Coughing)

50:38.535 --> 50:39.661
Here you go, man.

50:39.745 --> 50:41.621
One for the doc.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.415
Sure.

50:52.924 --> 50:54.301
Doc?

51:07.689 --> 51:09.649
Better than sitting down
to a Christmas eve dinner

51:09.733 --> 51:11.943
of turkey and hooch
back at the division CP.

51:12.027 --> 51:14.780
Damned if I don't like
old Joe Dominguez's

51:14.863 --> 51:16.698
rancid-assed beans better.

51:16.782 --> 51:18.867
Hello, Easy Company.

51:18.950 --> 51:20.410
All:
Hello, sir.

51:20.494 --> 51:21.620
Hello, sir.

51:21.703 --> 51:23.997
General MacAuliffe
sent a message to
the entire division.

51:24.080 --> 51:26.750
I thought maybe your people
would like to hear it.

51:26.833 --> 51:29.211
Oh, that should be
your prerogative, sir.

51:29.294 --> 51:30.295
Fine.

51:30.378 --> 51:32.005
Men!

51:33.590 --> 51:37.511
General MacAuliffe wishes us
all a merry Christmas.

51:37.594 --> 51:41.097
What's merry about
all this, you ask?

51:41.181 --> 51:42.599
Just this.

51:42.682 --> 51:45.560
"We've stopped cold everything
that's been thrown at us

51:45.644 --> 51:49.314
"from the north,
east, south and west.

51:49.397 --> 51:51.733
"Now, two days ago
the German commander

51:51.817 --> 51:54.861
"demanded our
honorable surrender

51:54.945 --> 51:58.740
"to save the USA
encircled troops
from total annihilation."

51:58.824 --> 52:02.786
The German commander
received the following reply.

52:02.869 --> 52:05.580
"To the German commander,

52:05.664 --> 52:07.833
"Nuts!"

52:07.916 --> 52:10.585
(Giggling)

52:10.669 --> 52:14.047
"We're giving our country
and our loved ones at home

"a worthy

"a merry Christmas."

52:22.889 --> 52:25.475
Merry Christmas to you all
and God bless you.

52:25.559 --> 52:28.270
(Soldiers shouting)
Merry Christmas, sir.

52:28.353 --> 52:30.939
(Screaming)
Nuts!

52:51.626 --> 52:55.046

53:12.188 --> 53:15.233

"Silent Night")

53:33.251 --> 53:34.669
Bill.

53:34.753 --> 53:35.754
Huh?

53:36.880 --> 53:39.174
Picture of my girl.

53:39.257 --> 53:42.802
Good looking broad, buck.

53:44.846 --> 53:47.682
She's...

53:48.683 --> 53:51.811
She's finished
with me.

53:51.895 --> 53:55.106
Yeah?

53:55.190 --> 53:57.525
Yeah.

53:58.944 --> 54:02.030
Yeah, she's, uh...

54:07.202 --> 54:10.789
Just in time
for Christmas, huh?

54:14.501 --> 54:16.795
Just in time
for Christmas.

54:19.130 --> 54:20.340
Oh shit!

54:20.423 --> 54:22.092
I almost forgot.

54:22.175 --> 54:24.010
Oh, oh.

54:24.094 --> 54:27.389
Lucky Strikes,
means fine tobacco.

54:27.472 --> 54:28.807
Where the hell
did you get those?

54:28.890 --> 54:29.891
Merry Christmas, fellas.

54:29.975 --> 54:33.061
Gotta thank
jolly old saint Luz.

54:33.144 --> 54:35.855
Oh, beautiful.

54:40.318 --> 54:41.569
There.

54:44.322 --> 54:46.157
There you go, Penk.

54:46.241 --> 54:49.452
I am shaking
so goddamn much,

54:49.536 --> 54:51.955
I feel like
I'm dancin'.

54:52.038 --> 54:54.124

54:54.207 --> 54:55.834
There you go.

54:55.917 --> 54:57.210
Frank, what
are you doing?

54:57.293 --> 54:59.838
It's Christmas, Pee-wee.

54:59.921 --> 55:01.798
Here, Frank.

55:01.881 --> 55:02.966
What is it?

55:03.049 --> 55:04.551
Lemon powder snow cone.

55:04.634 --> 55:05.844
Pass.

55:05.927 --> 55:07.971
Merry fucking Christmas.

55:15.395 --> 55:16.938
Harry.

55:19.607 --> 55:22.068
Fire's not
a good idea.

55:22.152 --> 55:23.653
Just a couple
of minutes.

55:25.030 --> 55:26.823
We're in a dell.

55:26.906 --> 55:29.576
A dell?

55:31.119 --> 55:34.622
You mean where fairies
and gnomes live?

55:38.668 --> 55:41.171
I swear I thought
I could smell a fire.

55:41.254 --> 55:44.049
I did smell a fire.

55:44.132 --> 55:45.967
Are you out
of your mind?

55:46.051 --> 55:48.762
Well, we're in a dell.

55:48.845 --> 55:50.055
Huh?

55:51.097 --> 55:52.057
Down!

55:52.140 --> 55:53.475
Crossfire!

55:55.018 --> 55:58.980
Oh, god no!

55:59.064 --> 56:00.690
Medic!

56:03.151 --> 56:04.903
This is captain Nixon.

56:04.986 --> 56:07.155
I need an "A" jeep
for 2nd battalion CP.

56:07.238 --> 56:08.364
Stay still, Harry.

56:08.448 --> 56:09.574

Hey, Doc,

56:09.657 --> 56:11.576

Move, get in!

56:25.465 --> 56:27.258
Doc!

56:27.342 --> 56:29.094
I gotta go.

56:29.177 --> 56:30.386
I gotta go.

56:30.470 --> 56:32.388
Eugene,
come on, get up.

56:32.472 --> 56:34.974
The captain's yelling,
come on, get up.

56:35.058 --> 56:36.392
Okay, get up,
not okay, lie down.

56:36.476 --> 56:37.977
Okay, get up,
come on, move!

57:11.928 --> 57:13.221
It's just
a scratch, Harry.

57:13.304 --> 57:14.681
You're not getting
out of here this easy.

57:14.764 --> 57:16.224
Jeep's on it's way,
hang tough.

57:16.307 --> 57:19.144
Here's a towel.

57:21.354 --> 57:23.481
Towel.

57:23.565 --> 57:25.608
Yeah sure.

57:32.157 --> 57:34.367
I got morphine in my pocket,
give it to him.

57:34.450 --> 57:35.660
Where you want it?

57:35.743 --> 57:36.703
Opposite thigh.

57:36.786 --> 57:37.745
Aaaah!

57:37.829 --> 57:39.289
Okay.

57:41.124 --> 57:42.542
Okay.

57:43.585 --> 57:45.420
Elevate his head.

57:48.631 --> 57:50.300
Get him up.

57:52.969 --> 57:55.180
There you go,
soldier, take that.

58:00.810 --> 58:02.103
Eugene,

58:02.187 --> 58:05.064
Get yourself into town,
get a hot meal.

Clear the road!

58:39.807 --> 58:42.227
(Screaming)

59:02.163 --> 59:04.249
Get out quick!

1:00:06.394 --> 1:00:08.980
Get your ass
out here!

1:00:10.356 --> 1:00:11.399
Come on!

Every hour,
on the hour,
on the radio,

1:01:18.674 --> 1:01:20.593

where the hell you are.

1:01:54.127 --> 1:01:56.421
You did that.

1:01:58.965 --> 1:02:00.466
I'll fix it up.

1:02:29.036 --> 1:02:32.665
Hey, Gene,
you called me Babe.

1:02:32.748 --> 1:02:34.459
I did?

When?

1:02:36.252 --> 1:02:39.589
Just now.
