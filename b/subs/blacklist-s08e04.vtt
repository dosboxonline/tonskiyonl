[tender music playing]

00:06.840 --> 00:09.217
[Liz] <i>Before I start running...</i>

00:10.051 --> 00:11.678
I need to rest.

00:14.556 --> 00:16.558
Even if it's just for one night.

01:10.236 --> 01:13.406
-You know how this ends.
-I can't find my sock.

01:16.201 --> 01:20.330
-We're gonna try and stop you.
-It's purple with little unicorns on it.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.999
Agnes thinks unicorns are good luck.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.460
Unicorn socks
to protect against Reddington?

01:26.127 --> 01:27.796
You got any better ideas?

01:27.879 --> 01:29.923
Yeah. Don't go after him.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.635
[dramatic music playing]

01:42.018 --> 01:43.937
Thanks for letting me stay.

01:47.982 --> 01:50.819
[phone beeps, then line rings]

01:51.653 --> 01:55.240
I'm texting you an address.
Meet me there as soon as you can.

01:56.491 --> 02:00.286
A few years ago, I found out
my husband was living a double life.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.123
Whoa.

02:04.791 --> 02:05.834
Yeah.

02:05.917 --> 02:10.713
He had secrets, lots of them,
including this apartment.

02:12.841 --> 02:16.845
I thought maybe we could find something
here that could help you out a little bit.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.721
-Me?
-Yeah.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.808
It's not much,
but it'll get you out of the city.

02:21.891 --> 02:25.520
Go on, take it. I've already gotten you
into enough trouble.

02:26.229 --> 02:29.566
You do know
we are gonna need more than that.

02:33.820 --> 02:37.657
We're gonna need more of everything:
money, weapons, people.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.743
-You have anybody in mind?
-I have a list. First, I--

02:42.787 --> 02:46.416
We call everyone on it.
And then we get my daughter.

02:46.499 --> 02:47.625
We've been made.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.882
Elizabeth Keen...

02:55.258 --> 02:56.676
will you marry me?

02:56.759 --> 02:58.469
[Esi] Liz, we gotta go now.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.391
[suspenseful music playing]

03:13.776 --> 03:14.777
Clear.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.130
[engine starts]

03:43.389 --> 03:44.390
We're too late.

03:59.864 --> 04:01.699
[dramatic music playing]

04:01.783 --> 04:06.162
I spoke with Reddington. He says Keen just
left a Kalorama address in a Ford Bronco.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.039
I want a BOLO on the car, not on Keen.

04:08.122 --> 04:10.875
-And when the cops find her in it?
-We'll protect her.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.503
Did she protect you
when Reddington was in the hospital?

04:13.586 --> 04:15.672
She planted a bomb that nearly killed you.

04:15.755 --> 04:19.801
So it's okay to protect an actual killer
like Reddington but not one of our own?

04:19.884 --> 04:21.886
What Keen almost did once

04:21.970 --> 04:24.722
is nothing compared to what
Reddington does on a daily basis.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.599
And yet he put her name on the Blacklist.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.726
[Cooper] Reddington wants
her found, not hurt.

04:28.810 --> 04:32.480
But given her desire to hurt him, I don't
know if she'll leave him any choice.

04:32.563 --> 04:35.775
-Which is why we have to find her first.
-I'll put out the BOLO.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.694
Before you do, I want to say one thing.

04:37.777 --> 04:41.239
As fond as we are of Agent Keen,
I believe she's equally fond of us.

04:41.322 --> 04:44.575
Given that, it wouldn't surprise me
if she were to reach out,

04:44.659 --> 04:46.536
solicit our help to find Reddington.

04:46.619 --> 04:47.954
If and when she does that,

04:48.037 --> 04:50.665
I know how tempting
it will be to give her help.

04:50.748 --> 04:52.166
But that would be a mistake.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.127
It would make matters worse, not better.

04:54.210 --> 04:58.131
So if she does call or show up
on your doorstep, I need to know.

04:58.214 --> 05:01.634
Park, get on the BOLO.
Aram, Ressler, put eyes on Agnes.

05:01.718 --> 05:04.304
We may not know where Keen is,
but she's in the city.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.556
She's not gonna leave it
without her daughter.

05:07.807 --> 05:10.351
[indistinct chatter]

05:11.477 --> 05:12.979
Liz, hi! What are you doing here?

05:13.062 --> 05:16.441
I don't have much time, Tadashi,
so I'll get to the point.

05:16.524 --> 05:19.110
I want you to come and work for me.

05:19.610 --> 05:22.572
Thanks, but I already have a job.
It's got a great health plan.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.949
As long as I do it well,
Reddington won't kill me.

05:26.659 --> 05:27.869
Reddington is dying.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.705
He'll deny it, but it's true.

05:30.788 --> 05:34.208
When he's gone, I'll be in a position
to give you all the work you'll need

05:34.292 --> 05:36.169
because I'm getting everything.

05:36.836 --> 05:40.173
Call Marvin Gerard.
He'll confirm it. One more thing.

05:40.256 --> 05:43.676
These are all of Reddington's associates
that I'm aware of.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.928
I need their phone numbers.

05:46.929 --> 05:50.516
-I'm sorry, but I don't have them.
-I know, but you can hack them.

05:52.643 --> 05:54.062
She said you were sick.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.397
Like pushing-daisies sick.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.233
Aspirants are all the same.

05:59.317 --> 06:03.404
A little bit desperate, irrational,
always impatient.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.698
They never wait for the body to cool.

06:05.782 --> 06:08.117
I told her I was with you, hot or cold,

06:08.201 --> 06:11.704
but since you mention it,
are you, you know, cooling?

06:11.788 --> 06:15.416
Like a lion in winter,
I am both diminished and dangerous,

06:15.500 --> 06:20.004
as anyone who offers
to help Elizabeth will quickly find out.

06:23.508 --> 06:26.344
Exactly how would you define "help"?

06:26.427 --> 06:29.972
Because... she had this list.

06:31.516 --> 06:34.560
-I know it's a shock, but it's true.
-Raymond is a traitor?

06:34.644 --> 06:37.939
<i>A Russian spy codenamed N-13.</i>
<i>He's been playing us for years.</i>

06:38.022 --> 06:40.274
-[call waiting beeps]
-One sec. Sorry.

06:40.358 --> 06:41.609
[phone beeping]

06:42.235 --> 06:45.154
-Hello?
-Ruddiger, have you spoken with Elizabeth?

06:45.238 --> 06:49.575
I'm on with her right now. She says
you're a traitor. Not sure which country.

06:49.659 --> 06:53.037
<i>Ruddiger, please,</i>
<i>I'm loyal to principle, not country.</i>

06:53.121 --> 06:56.415
And the first principle
I'm loyal to is loyalty.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.334
Do I have yours?

06:58.417 --> 07:01.254
[Heddie] <i>Now, hold on. Back up.</i>
<i>Say that again for me.</i>

07:01.337 --> 07:05.216
<i>-He cut a deal.</i>
-A deal? What? A deal with whom?

07:05.299 --> 07:06.926
<i>With the FBI.</i>

07:07.844 --> 07:10.680
Are you telling me
that son of a bitch is a snitch?

07:10.763 --> 07:13.015
[Liz] <i>Yup, which is why I want you</i>
<i>to work for me.</i>

07:13.099 --> 07:14.809
I'll tell you who I won't work for,

07:14.892 --> 07:17.562
and it's that turncoat,
that quisling, that--

07:17.645 --> 07:19.063
[call waiting beeping]

07:19.147 --> 07:20.148
Hold that thought.

07:21.607 --> 07:25.111
-Someone's ears were burning.
-You've spoken with Elizabeth.

07:25.194 --> 07:28.823
-Pardon my French but what a yenta.
-[Liz] <i>I can hear you both.</i>

07:28.906 --> 07:31.576
-Spreading rumors, are we?
-Telling truths.

07:31.659 --> 07:35.246
[groans] I think I hit "conference"
instead of "call waiting."

07:35.329 --> 07:38.416
-Who's next on your list?
-Wouldn't you like to know?

07:41.002 --> 07:43.963
He's the past, Morgan. I'm the future.

07:44.046 --> 07:46.048
That's right, Tony, he works for Moscow.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.301
Sure, Glen, I'll hold.

07:49.427 --> 07:53.473
No, no, no, Chuck, before you take
the other call, just hear me out. Chuck?

07:59.312 --> 08:02.064
I got a message
from our friend in the East.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.149
He wants to meet.

08:04.567 --> 08:08.654
He won't be easily appeased.
Put him off for the moment.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.490
I'm fighting a war on one front.

08:10.573 --> 08:13.951
I'm not sure
I have the strength to fight it on two.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.331
You're saying
you wouldn't tell Mr. Cooper.

08:18.414 --> 08:19.999
I'm saying it depends.

08:20.082 --> 08:21.083
Depends on what?

08:21.751 --> 08:24.378
I'm just saying,
if she did reach out to you,

08:24.462 --> 08:27.757
if you actually saw her,
you might think differently.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.343
-Did she reach out to you?
-No.

08:30.426 --> 08:33.763
But if she did, I'm just saying.
It might make a difference.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.140
[knocking on door]

08:41.145 --> 08:41.979
Can I help you?

08:42.063 --> 08:44.815
Mrs. Marks, we're with the FBI.
We work with Elizabeth Keen.

08:45.816 --> 08:46.943
Is everything all right?

08:47.026 --> 08:50.780
You're looking after her daughter.
Has she arranged a time to pick her up?

08:51.948 --> 08:53.950
[foreboding music playing]

08:57.036 --> 09:01.123
In the old days, drug cocktails
were decidedly more appealing.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.417
I spoke to our friend in the East.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.878
Ah, thank you. That's a relief.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.464
He expects you in Moscow
the day after tomorrow.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.258
And it gets worse.

09:11.008 --> 09:14.095
Worse than Moscow at this time of year?
At any time of year?

09:19.850 --> 09:20.851
[groans]

09:28.859 --> 09:33.823
Ah. Well, looks like the second front
has officially engaged.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.204
[dramatic music playing]

09:40.288 --> 09:42.957
-[Esi] No one said yes?
-[Liz] Not even an "I'll think about it."

09:43.040 --> 09:46.002
-Is there anyone else?
-There is one other person.

09:46.085 --> 09:49.088
And he's worth more
than everyone on this list combined.

09:49.171 --> 09:52.091
If I could get him,
we'd have a fighting chance.

09:52.174 --> 09:55.469
-Who's that?
-Marvin Gerard, Reddington's lawyer.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.472
He may not know
where all the bodies are buried,

09:58.556 --> 10:01.058
but I think he knows
where the money is kept.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.477
You gotta assume
Reddington's already contacted him.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.938
Which is why I need
to talk to him in person.

10:06.022 --> 10:09.442
I need you to follow him and tell me
when he's somewhere safe to talk.

10:09.525 --> 10:12.486
Meanwhile, I'm gonna make
arrangements to pick up Agnes.

10:12.570 --> 10:15.656
I can't believe
they pledged their lives, fortunes,

10:15.740 --> 10:19.994
and not-so-sacred honor
to a traitorous sociopath.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.580
Are they all really that scared?

10:22.663 --> 10:23.623
It's fear.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.501
Take this burner. It's clean.

10:28.377 --> 10:30.171
Call me when you find a safe location.

10:31.130 --> 10:35.176
About Agnes, be careful.
You know they're gonna be watching her.

10:35.801 --> 10:36.677
Yeah.

10:38.929 --> 10:41.265
[Cooper] <i>We found the Bronco</i>
<i>abandoned in a parking garage.</i>

10:41.349 --> 10:44.060
Have you gone outside
the task force for help?

10:44.143 --> 10:47.188
-We can clean up our own mess.
-Evidence would suggest otherwise.

10:47.271 --> 10:49.815
<i>Broadcasting her fugitive status</i>
<i>would ruin any chance</i>

10:49.899 --> 10:52.360
Elizabeth has of putting
this genie back in a bottle.

10:52.443 --> 10:55.613
Is she the genie
or am I the genie? I'm confused.

10:55.696 --> 10:59.533
You know what I find confusing? The tape
Elizabeth played me of you and Katarina,

10:59.617 --> 11:01.410
<i>where she accuses you of being a spy.</i>

11:01.494 --> 11:05.665
By all means, let's take what
Brunhilda says on that tape as gospel.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.875
N-13. What does that mean to you?

11:07.958 --> 11:10.503
<i>It means you need</i>
<i>to get your priorities straight.</i>

11:10.586 --> 11:13.089
You picked up the telephone
and now we're talking.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.549
When was the last time
you talked with Agent Keen?

11:15.633 --> 11:20.679
Elizabeth Keen is your target, not me.
There he is.

11:31.273 --> 11:34.110
I'm not an errand boy.
I won't be ordered about.

11:34.193 --> 11:37.029
Our friend has concerns about Keen.

11:37.113 --> 11:40.241
Elizabeth Keen is not to be touched.

11:40.324 --> 11:43.119
I accept our friend's concern,
nothing more.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.995
You're familiar with Scuti Global?

11:45.079 --> 11:47.915
Of course.
It's become quite the profit center.

11:47.998 --> 11:51.752
Which it will continue to be
as long as I have their trust.

11:51.836 --> 11:55.131
And you're a little concerned
that trust may be broken

11:55.214 --> 11:57.133
now that your name has surfaced

11:57.216 --> 12:01.762
as part of this House Intelligence
Committee investigation?

12:01.846 --> 12:05.391
Before you go to Moscow,
we'd like you to make this go away.

12:06.684 --> 12:11.021
I see. So I came here
to be interrogated and solicited.

12:12.106 --> 12:15.276
I'd like to think you came here
to do the right thing.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.448
[piano playing classical music]

12:24.410 --> 12:28.080
All right. So go and change.
And I'll be right in.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.214
Is this really necessary?

12:37.298 --> 12:40.259
You said Liz didn't tell you
when she was gonna pick up Agnes,

12:40.342 --> 12:43.512
so we have to assume
she could pick her up anytime.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.098
So you're just gonna follow us
everywhere we go?

12:46.182 --> 12:48.767
We don't want to frighten Agnes,
but we have to find Liz.

12:48.851 --> 12:52.229
-So you can take her from her daughter.
-That's the last thing we want.

12:53.230 --> 12:55.232
Then promise me you won't.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.909
Hey, girl, need any help?

13:05.993 --> 13:08.871
-What are you doing here?
-Admiring my beautiful girl.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.624
-There are agents in the lobby.
-[Agnes] I already told her.

13:12.374 --> 13:15.836
How about you go to class and
I'll tell Merritt about our plan, okay?

13:15.920 --> 13:16.754
Okay, Mommy.

13:16.837 --> 13:19.507
-See you tonight?
-Yes, you will. I can't wait.

13:24.762 --> 13:27.348
-Your plan? What plan?
-[phone chimes]

13:29.308 --> 13:31.769
You're working the night shift
at the hospital, right?

13:31.852 --> 13:34.688
-Liz, the FBI is following me.
-Not anymore.

13:34.772 --> 13:38.192
Not if you do exactly as I say.
Now, listen carefully.

13:39.485 --> 13:43.405
[Marvin] Even if Reddington liked you,
which I suspect he doesn't,

13:43.489 --> 13:47.451
and even if he trusted you,
which I am positive he doesn't...

13:48.327 --> 13:51.872
he wouldn't hesitate to kill you
if you showed him this.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.250
I thought you wanted me
to organize the accounts.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.460
I did. But digitally?

13:56.961 --> 14:01.924
He insists on analog accounting.
A book, a ledger, something offline.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.050
[Liz] Marvin.

14:05.511 --> 14:06.720
The answer is no.

14:06.804 --> 14:09.014
-Hi, I'm Liz.
-Skip.

14:09.098 --> 14:12.726
I know who you are.
You're sort of a legend around the office.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.395
