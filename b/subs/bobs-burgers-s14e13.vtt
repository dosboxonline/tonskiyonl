So, cool story.

07:25.762 --> 07:28.113
I kinda sweat through my skirt,

07:28.264 --> 07:30.006
and, uh, I put it in the dryer

07:30.099 --> 07:31.766
and now
the dryer door won't open.

07:31.860 --> 07:33.100
Um. So what
are you doing in here?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.569
Um, nothing.
I'm not hiding or anything,

07:34.621 --> 07:36.179
'cause who hides at a party?
That's weird.

07:36.198 --> 07:37.956
That'd be super weird.
No, I'm f-- I'm fine.

07:38.107 --> 07:39.516
-Okay.
-Okay, I'm kinda sorta hiding,

07:39.534 --> 07:40.850
but not from, like,
anyone specific.

07:40.869 --> 07:42.368
It's just more like hiding from,

07:42.463 --> 07:44.704
uh, everything
that's going on out there?

07:44.798 --> 07:46.298
Is it okay if we don't talk
about it, actually?

07:46.449 --> 07:48.041
Oh, yeah. Um, hey, do you think

07:48.193 --> 07:50.026
maybe you could help me
with the dryer door?

07:50.119 --> 07:51.361
Oh, sure.

07:51.454 --> 07:53.305
[straining]

07:53.532 --> 07:54.789
Oh, my God.

07:54.883 --> 07:56.716
Yeah, no dice, home slice.

07:56.868 --> 07:58.125
I'm very sorry I said that.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.886
[groans] What am I gonna do?

08:00.038 --> 08:02.038
Hey, uh, maybe
I could go find Chelsea

08:02.131 --> 08:03.540
and maybe she could help?

08:03.558 --> 08:04.483
Okay, maybe...

-Yeah.

08:06.394 --> 08:07.560
There she is.

Hey, Chelsea, some
soda spilled over there--

08:09.231 --> 08:11.490
Boo! I'm dancing, so no. Bye.

08:11.641 --> 08:13.383
Okay, yeah.
I just-- I'm-I'm going.

08:13.401 --> 08:15.068
Um, you know what?
Maybe we just

08:15.220 --> 08:17.220
-try the dryer door again?
-Yeah, good idea.

08:17.239 --> 08:20.314
Okay, just a few more steps.

08:20.392 --> 08:22.483
Don't look yet, don't look yet.

08:22.577 --> 08:24.227
-Okay, now look.

08:24.229 --> 08:25.319
-[Gene] Wow.

[Gene]
Trash Pallet Bob's.

08:26.898 --> 08:28.398
-Yup.
-I love it.

08:28.491 --> 08:29.749
Damn it. I guess you win.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.343
This is better.
Even though you cheated

08:31.494 --> 08:33.011
-by being really good at this.
-Yes!

08:33.162 --> 08:36.014
In your faces!
I win! I'm the winner!

08:36.165 --> 08:38.241
I mean, thank you.
Thanks a lot, Louise.

08:38.334 --> 08:40.668
It is really impressive.

08:40.762 --> 08:42.020
Should we take it down?

08:42.247 --> 08:43.355
-What?
-What?
-Oh.

08:43.582 --> 08:45.749
'Cause, you know,
it's past closing time and--

08:45.767 --> 08:47.675
[groans] I never ate my burger.

08:47.694 --> 08:48.935
Let's serve it to him down here.

08:49.087 --> 08:50.754
-In Trash Pallet Bob's.
-Ooh.

08:50.847 --> 08:54.107
Really? That would be, like,
a lifelong dream come true.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.516
Teddy, you just did this.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.927
Yeah, no, I know,
but I didn't know

08:58.021 --> 08:59.946
it was my lifelong dream
until I got started.

09:00.098 --> 09:01.689
But we might
as well enjoy it, right?

09:01.783 --> 09:03.542
-Well, we did.
-Oh, come on, Bob.

09:03.693 --> 09:05.118
Don't be a pallet pooper.

09:05.270 --> 09:06.360
Yeah, Dad,
the upstairs restaurant

09:06.380 --> 09:07.604
never has to know about this.

09:07.773 --> 09:09.030
[sighs] Okay, fine.

09:09.107 --> 09:10.940
-Yes!
-Yay! We get to watch Teddy

09:11.034 --> 09:12.384
eat a burger in our basement.

09:16.782 --> 09:17.797

09:17.874 --> 09:18.723

09:18.875 --> 09:20.058
-I don't know what to do.
-Whew.

09:20.285 --> 09:22.376
Yeah, uh, that felt like
a long time to do that.

09:22.545 --> 09:24.563
I need to get out of here.
I can't miss another slow song.

09:24.714 --> 09:26.064
Yeah, yeah. Totally. Totally.

09:26.215 --> 09:27.974
Uh, Sam,
you don't have to stay here

09:28.068 --> 09:29.809
and suffer with me.
You should go.

09:29.961 --> 09:30.977
Yeah...

09:31.071 --> 09:32.404
Wait, why are you hiding--

09:32.555 --> 09:34.406
Um, I mean, taking
a long break in here again?

09:34.557 --> 09:37.075
Well, I--
It's kind of embarrassing.

09:37.226 --> 09:38.468
I'm wearing a towel,

09:38.561 --> 09:39.986
so I'm pretty familiar
with embarrassing.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.487
Right. Well, I'm, um...

09:41.656 --> 09:44.657
I'm just, like, not really sure
how to be out there.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.143
You know? Like, I'm not much
of a dancer, like, at all,

09:47.162 --> 09:48.995
and I heard there was
gonna be slow dancing,

09:49.072 --> 09:50.830
and after I heard that,
I started having

09:50.982 --> 09:51.923
what I thought was, I'm pretty
sure, like a heart attack

09:52.150 --> 09:53.666
or something?
Just a-a tightness.

09:53.743 --> 09:55.168
-Oh.
-Yeah, and then I thought,
you know, well,

09:55.320 --> 09:56.744
I just won't
ask anyone to dance,

09:56.763 --> 09:58.597
and I'll just hang out near
the snacks and that'll be fine.

09:58.748 --> 09:59.764
But then I thought,
you know, what if somebody

09:59.916 --> 10:01.248
asks me to dance?
And I'm not gonna

10:01.268 --> 10:03.159
hurt somebody's feelings,
so, no, I would have to

10:03.252 --> 10:04.418
do it, right?
But then if it's a slow dance,

10:04.438 --> 10:05.604
and I mean, I don't know
where to put my hands

10:05.831 --> 10:07.421
or where to look or
to like, where to breathe

10:07.499 --> 10:08.848
or like, what to say
to each other, like--

10:09.000 --> 10:10.424
Or do we not talk?
Like, nobody told me

10:10.444 --> 10:12.018
any of that, so it's like,
what is going to happen?

10:12.112 --> 10:13.837
What's gonna happen?
So I thought, you know, if I...

10:13.855 --> 10:15.614
wanted to come, and I thought
that maybe I did want to come,

10:15.782 --> 10:17.282
but I don't know what made me
think that I could handle it.

10:17.433 --> 10:18.283
And maybe I think
I'm just gonna never go to

10:18.476 --> 10:19.692
another party again. Yeah.

10:19.861 --> 10:20.952
Oh. And I mean,
the whole UB thing

10:21.104 --> 10:23.104
is probably difficult
to navigate, too.

10:23.181 --> 10:24.347
What's UB?

10:24.366 --> 10:25.290
-Upper butt?
-What is that? Wh--

10:25.441 --> 10:27.108
Is that a thing? Is that-- What?

10:27.127 --> 10:28.776
No. Never mind, never mind.
Not a thing at all.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.778
[gasps] Oh, it's a cat.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.113
Yeah, it's just a cat.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.798
Uh, I guess if we're gonna
be trapped in here,

10:33.950 --> 10:35.800
it's nice to have a cute little
kitty-- Okay, it's pooping

10:36.027 --> 10:37.785
in the litter box...
-Oh. Oh...

10:37.804 --> 10:38.970
Does that look normal?

10:39.197 --> 10:41.473
He's definitely not regular.
Oh, that's strong.

10:41.700 --> 10:44.050
I can smell it through
my fingers, somehow.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.202
I'm just gonna try the dryer
again real quick.

Nope, still stuck. Cool.

are you guys still open?

11:04.055 --> 11:05.330
We were looking
for a good binner spot.

Binner is the meal after dinner,
but before bed.

but that might be from me.

No, the food's for downstairs.
We're just--

11:15.567 --> 11:17.509

except the people I just texted.

11:32.584 --> 11:33.674

But it's already, like,
impossible to get in.

-So, yeah.
-Of course. I totally get it.

11:37.698 --> 11:39.422
But get me two tables
or I'll die right here

11:39.441 --> 11:41.515
-and you'll have to dispose
of my body.
-Yeah, yeah.

11:41.535 --> 11:44.444
I'll see what I can do.
Let me talk to my manager. Mom?

11:44.538 --> 11:46.705
[stammering] Maybe.

11:46.932 --> 11:47.539
Uh, Bob?

11:47.766 --> 11:49.523
Uh, um, I-I...

11:49.543 --> 11:51.876
Oh my God, thank you so much.
Some of my party's arriving late

11:52.028 --> 11:53.694

extra settings at the table.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.696
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

11:55.716 --> 11:56.940
Oh, my God.

11:56.958 --> 11:59.867
Okay. This belt I made
out of what I think

11:59.886 --> 12:03.704
are Chelsea's dad's dirty socks
should hold the towel in place.

12:03.782 --> 12:05.056
And it looks okay, right?

12:05.283 --> 12:06.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:06.134 --> 12:07.392
I mean, it seems
fashion-forward.

12:07.619 --> 12:09.394
I'm going with it and I'm
gonna get back out there.

12:09.545 --> 12:11.287
And Sam, you should, too.
I mean, honestly,

12:11.306 --> 12:12.564
what's the worst
that could go wrong?

12:12.791 --> 12:14.307
Uh... Yeah, I don't know,

12:14.459 --> 12:15.567
I guess I could be
dancing with someone

12:15.736 --> 12:17.460
and then I step on her foot
and break her toe.

12:17.479 --> 12:18.737
Or what if I accidentally
touch that pressure point

12:18.964 --> 12:20.146
on the back
of someone's shoulders

12:20.298 --> 12:21.889
that just makes them,
like, fall down dead?

12:21.908 --> 12:23.316
-That could happen?
-Yeah, I don't know! Probably!

12:23.468 --> 12:24.801
Oh no! The second slow song!
I'm going.

12:24.894 --> 12:26.319
Uh, okay. Uh, have fun.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.154
Uh, honestly, Sam,
you shouldn't stay in here

with Chelsea's dad's dirty
laundry and the cat poop

12:30.900 --> 12:33.084
that looks like the cat has
major digestive problems.

12:33.311 --> 12:34.568
How has the smell gotten worse?

12:34.662 --> 12:37.130
All right,
I-I'm gonna try to scoop it.

12:38.650 --> 12:41.484
That, uh, doesn't look like
the right way to scoop poop.

12:41.577 --> 12:42.835
I mean, I'm pretty sure
you're not supposed

12:42.929 --> 12:44.411
to close your eyes
and turn your head?

Uh... Here, I'll, uh,
I'll help you real quick.

-Oh, no.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.028
Hey, hey, um, well,
uh, the good news is

13:09.180 --> 13:10.604
you can wash it off 'cause
we're in a laundry room.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.698
Um, but then I don't know
if you'll be able

13:12.851 --> 13:14.017
to dry it, 'cause-- you know.

13:14.110 --> 13:16.002
[Tina screaming]

13:19.800 --> 13:22.041
Okay, so I think I washed
most of the cat diarrhea

13:22.193 --> 13:23.709
off my shirt, so that's good.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.194
But it is very, very wet.

13:25.329 --> 13:28.047
Ugh. This is when a dryer
with a door that opens

13:28.199 --> 13:29.382
-comes in handy.
-Yup, yup.

13:29.476 --> 13:30.975
And sure, I could change
into a different shirt,

13:31.127 --> 13:33.127
if anyone in Chelsea's family
ever washed them.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.796
This basket is all socks
and towels and underwear!

13:35.816 --> 13:37.223
Who wears this much underwear?!

13:37.375 --> 13:39.150
Tina, do you want me to go get
Chelsea's mom and dad?

13:39.302 --> 13:40.376
And maybe they can help?

13:40.395 --> 13:41.894
Eh, then I'd be the person

13:42.047 --> 13:43.546
who brings
Chelsea's parents downstairs,

13:43.565 --> 13:45.898
which will make everyone sad and
might make Chelsea murder me?

So, maybe not?

-[Jimmy Jr. whoops]
-Uh...

13:49.054 --> 13:50.161
I really got to get out there

13:50.388 --> 13:51.979
before "Sweet Love Sugar"
comes on.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.481
Eh! Got to stretch
my hammies.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.725
Gotta keep it loose, goose!

13:55.743 --> 13:56.893
These pants might look tight,

13:56.911 --> 13:58.394
but they're actually
really stretchy.

13:58.487 --> 13:59.987
Wait for me,
Jimmy Jr.'s upper butt.

14:00.081 --> 14:01.339
Wait for me.

14:01.566 --> 14:04.400
Here are your burgers.
Kind of a pallet cleanser.

14:04.419 --> 14:06.660
Right? Get it?
'Cause of the pallets?

in my butt

14:10.499 --> 14:11.832
and that's a compliment.
I mean it.

14:12.001 --> 14:13.593
-Thank you.
-Sorry about the splinter.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.520
I-I wanted to sand the seats,

14:15.671 --> 14:17.263
but I had to hang
these lights, too, you know?

14:17.357 --> 14:20.507
There was just so much pressure
to get it done and open, right?

14:20.676 --> 14:22.643
Dalton, we usually
charge for splinters,

14:22.696 --> 14:23.936
but for you, it's on the house.

14:24.089 --> 14:25.922
-But tweezers cost extra.
-BOB: Hey, guys?

14:26.015 --> 14:27.532
Uh, please send up
the new orders

14:27.701 --> 14:29.425
as soon as you can
so we can not do this anymore.

14:29.518 --> 14:33.187
I'm not sure an underground
restaurant is exactly... legal.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.948
So, we should probably
keep that in mind. Thank you.

14:36.101 --> 14:39.268
Okay! Hi, welcome
to Trash Pallet Bob's.

14:39.362 --> 14:41.604
Everyone had their tetanus
shots? You'll be fine.

14:41.697 --> 14:44.865
Ugh, my shirt is still so wet.
Air drying is a myth.

14:44.959 --> 14:47.276
Okay, I'm thinking maybe
I can make a shirt

14:47.295 --> 14:49.278
out of Chelsea's
dad's underwear?

14:49.297 --> 14:50.446
Sew them together with...

14:50.465 --> 14:52.539
-my hair, maybe?
-Y-Yeah...?

14:52.634 --> 14:54.375
Ugh! I just wish I could
start this whole night over

14:54.394 --> 14:56.135
and not drench my skirt in sweat

14:56.287 --> 14:57.620
and not get it stuck
in the world's worst dryer!

14:57.713 --> 14:58.730
And not fall boobs-first

14:58.957 --> 15:00.381
into the most disgusting
litter box ever!

15:00.400 --> 15:01.733
W-W-W-Wait. Uh, "start over."

15:01.884 --> 15:02.567
What if-- What if, um...

15:02.718 --> 15:04.293
What if we unplug the dryer

15:04.387 --> 15:05.645
and then we just plug it
back in and restart it?

15:05.797 --> 15:07.146
Like, you know,
when you restart a computer?

15:07.298 --> 15:08.389
Yup. Let's try it.
Where's the plug?

15:08.483 --> 15:09.723
Wh-Wh-Wh--
Where's the plug?

15:09.743 --> 15:11.467
Uh, uh, oh! Here.
Uh, I-I can see the outlet.

15:11.560 --> 15:14.470
Let me just see
if I can reach it, uh...

15:14.639 --> 15:16.989
[grunting] Oh, God.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.325
Oh, wow. Oh, this is harder
than I thought. [grunts]

15:19.477 --> 15:22.145
-TINA: You okay?
-Yeah, I'm good. I'm fine.

15:22.238 --> 15:25.164
Ah! Ha-ha! I got it.
Plugging it back in...

15:25.333 --> 15:26.424
[grunting]

15:26.575 --> 15:28.334
Oh, wow. Oh, God.

15:28.486 --> 15:29.594
[chiming]

15:29.745 --> 15:31.320
Oh, my God, it opened!

15:31.339 --> 15:33.172
Sam, you're a genius! Thank you!

15:33.266 --> 15:34.507
Oh, yeah, you're welcome.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.767
Wow, that's the hardest
thing I've ever done.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.510
I'm gonna change back into this

15:37.604 --> 15:39.011
and I'm gonna throw
this baby in on tumble dry.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.088
And then it's time
to get on the UB train.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.590
Next stop:
Upper Butts-sylvannia.

15:43.610 --> 15:44.925
I'm very happy for you.

15:44.945 --> 15:45.944
You mind turning that way
while I change

15:46.095 --> 15:47.261
into my skirt
and dry my shirt?

15:47.280 --> 15:48.646
Oh, yeah, yeah. Uh, of course.

15:48.798 --> 15:50.840
Maybe I'll also just, uh,
put this box over my head.

15:50.858 --> 15:52.933
-I mean, you don't have to--
-And then I'll just hum,
so I--

15:52.953 --> 15:54.435
-so I can't hear anything.
-Uh...

15:54.529 --> 15:56.603
-[humming]
-Okay.

15:56.698 --> 15:58.347
[continues humming]

15:58.441 --> 16:00.516
So sorry, we're full right now,

16:00.609 --> 16:02.018
but my hand has room...

16:02.111 --> 16:04.704
Oh! I'm being told
a table just opened up.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.022
[whispering]
Because of the money.

16:06.191 --> 16:07.448
Right this way.

16:07.525 --> 16:09.616
It smells, uh, sort of
like mildew down there.

16:09.711 --> 16:12.119
-I hope you mil-don't mind.
-Oh, my God.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.472
It's the hottest place in town,
it smells like garbage,

16:14.623 --> 16:17.475
and no one has done this before.
And this guy built it.

16:17.626 --> 16:19.293
Teddy Handimahn.
Am I saying that right?

16:19.387 --> 16:22.981
Oh, no, I-I was just saying
that I'm a handyman, but yeah.

16:23.132 --> 16:25.041
-Is that the bathroom?
-That's the walk-in freezer.

16:25.059 --> 16:27.043
Love it! Come on, you guys.
Just so you know,

16:27.061 --> 16:28.820
we're definitely not
going in there to do drugs.

16:28.971 --> 16:30.896
All right, sounds good.
Nice talking to you.

16:31.049 --> 16:32.824
-Good as new, right?
-Yeah, you can't see
the poop anymore.

16:32.975 --> 16:34.659
Unless you know where to look,
in which case you might see,

16:34.886 --> 16:36.068
like, a really faint
outline of the poop,

16:36.162 --> 16:37.720
but it's pretty dark in there,
so you'll be fine.

16:37.855 --> 16:39.238
No one's gonna know you're
wearing a diarrhea shirt.

16:39.390 --> 16:40.314
-Great.

Perfect timing.

16:43.319 --> 16:44.410
Here we go.

16:44.562 --> 16:47.005
Sam, are you sure
you don't want to come out

16:47.156 --> 16:48.914
and join the party?
It's close to the end.

16:49.067 --> 16:50.750
You can hide
in the shadows and, um,

16:50.844 --> 16:52.159
just feel like you got that far?

16:52.253 --> 16:54.587
Uh, yeah. Um, I'll be out
in a minute. You go ahead.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.572
I-I-- You've got...

16:56.591 --> 16:59.183

17:19.280 --> 17:20.204
Did you go outside to fart

17:20.356 --> 17:21.372
so no one would know it was you?

17:21.524 --> 17:22.948
[laughs]
I would never do that.

17:23.101 --> 17:24.433
Sorry, Tammy, I'm just
gonna dance past you...

17:24.452 --> 17:26.269
