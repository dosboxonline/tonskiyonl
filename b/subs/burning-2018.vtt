03:46.875 --> 03:48.240
do you have a girlfriend?

03:48.875 --> 03:49.910
I don't

03:50.000 --> 03:52.787
uh-oh... this is a girl's watch

03:53.167 --> 03:54.907
you should start looking for one

03:55.958 --> 03:57.073
Lee jongsu

03:59.250 --> 04:00.581
don't you remember me?

04:01.208 --> 04:03.415
We lived in the same neighborhood

04:03.667 --> 04:06.158
manoo village, tanhyun town, paju city

04:08.125 --> 04:09.990
it's me, shin haemi

04:11.375 --> 04:13.536
I had plastic surgery.

04:13.625 --> 04:15.081
Pretty, right

04:16.250 --> 04:19.492
are you free? It's my break soon

04:29.708 --> 04:31.068
Have you had military service yet?

04:31.667 --> 04:33.203
Finished it

04:35.000 --> 04:36.160
and then?

04:37.583 --> 04:38.698
And then what?

04:45.083 --> 04:50.623
I graduated college. Now
I'm working part-time

04:52.792 --> 04:54.828
but I'm doing something else on the side

04:56.083 --> 04:59.621
like what? Can I ask?

05:01.708 --> 05:02.993
I write

05:03.750 --> 05:06.332
you write? What are you writing

05:07.292 --> 05:08.452
a novel

05:10.833 --> 05:12.289
then are you a writer

05:13.333 --> 05:15.244
not officially

05:17.292 --> 05:19.374
I'm trying to become one though

05:20.917 --> 05:22.407
how cool

05:22.833 --> 05:24.494
Lee jongsu the writer

05:31.292 --> 05:32.623
How's work?

05:32.708 --> 05:35.996
It's fun

05:37.208 --> 05:39.665
I like this kind of work. Physical work

05:41.125 --> 05:43.616
I only work when they call

05:43.708 --> 05:45.619
it gives me a more flexible schedule

05:47.417 --> 05:48.657
so that's cool

05:51.708 --> 05:54.165
now you look like the haemi I know

05:55.708 --> 05:57.869
do you want this? From the raffle

06:08.417 --> 06:10.373
It's my first time wearing a wrist-watch

06:13.500 --> 06:15.582
jeez, it's so tacky

06:23.833 --> 06:27.280
Hey, want to grab a drink with me tonight?

06:29.292 --> 06:30.372
Why not?

06:38.917 --> 06:39.917
Guess what

06:41.750 --> 06:43.661
I'm going to Africa

06:44.292 --> 06:46.658
Africa? Why

06:46.917 --> 06:50.614
I've been saving up to travel

06:51.208 --> 06:52.823
but why Africa

07:04.667 --> 07:06.123
This is a pantomime

07:07.833 --> 07:10.165
I'm learning pantomime these days

07:11.500 --> 07:14.116
why? Do you want to be an actress?

07:14.208 --> 07:17.450
You think anyone can be an actress?

07:18.042 --> 07:20.408
I'm just learning it for fun

07:21.875 --> 07:27.074
look. I can eat tangerines whenever I want

07:30.833 --> 07:33.245
that's good. You're talented

07:36.542 --> 07:38.703
this has nothing to do with talent

07:40.875 --> 07:42.365
the trick is...

07:42.458 --> 07:45.120
Instead of thinking there
"is" a tangerine here

07:45.250 --> 07:48.913
you need to forget
that there "isn't" one.

07:51.292 --> 07:55.410
The important thing is that
you have to really want one

07:55.958 --> 07:58.040
then your mouth will water.

07:58.125 --> 07:59.865
And it'll really taste good

08:23.042 --> 08:28.082
Do you know the bushmen
of the kalahari desert?

08:28.750 --> 08:32.322
They talk about the two “hungers”

08:33.375 --> 08:37.323
starving people. "Hunger" in english.

08:38.500 --> 08:41.082
"Little hunger" and "great hunger"

08:41.332 --> 08:44.951
the "little hunger" wants
food for the belly

08:45.042 --> 08:48.910
but the "great hunger" hungers
for the meaning of life

08:49.417 --> 08:54.036
someone wishing to know why we live,
and what meaning of life is

08:54.292 --> 08:56.874
that sort of thing

08:57.333 --> 09:00.325
they are the truly hungry people.
So they are called

09:00.500 --> 09:02.491
"great hunger"

09:02.958 --> 09:07.327
so you're going to Africa
to meet..."Great hunger”

09:09.875 --> 09:12.947
cool, right? Great hunger

09:16.333 --> 09:17.493
jongsu

09:18.625 --> 09:19.831
Lee jongsu

09:20.833 --> 09:22.869
can you do me a favor?

09:25.292 --> 09:27.954
I have a pet cat

09:28.583 --> 09:30.119
can you feed it while I'm in Africa

09:30.208 --> 09:32.119
can you feed it while I'm in Africa?

09:32.958 --> 09:35.324
Should I bring it over to my place?

09:35.625 --> 09:36.660
No

09:37.250 --> 09:38.990
You come to my place

09:39.333 --> 09:42.575
a cat shouldn't be moved from its house

10:56.750 --> 10:58.615
What's with all the luggage?

11:00.625 --> 11:02.456
I'm moving into my house in paju

11:02.625 --> 11:04.365
today? - Yeah.

11:14.625 --> 11:16.661
Anyone still lives in your paju house?

11:17.250 --> 11:18.706
No one

11:19.458 --> 11:21.744
my mom left when I was little

11:24.083 --> 11:26.449
and my sister got married a few years ago

11:27.000 --> 11:29.662
so it was just my father
raising the cows by himself

11:29.958 --> 11:31.869
but he ran into a problem.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.741
So now I have to return home

11:37.917 --> 11:39.828
you're not asking what the problem was?

11:42.583 --> 11:44.699
There are always problems.

11:47.417 --> 11:48.623
We're here

12:07.042 --> 12:08.373
Hello

12:43.250 --> 12:45.206
Nice room

12:45.792 --> 12:50.365
my old room had a toilet bowl
next to the kitchen sink

13:07.833 --> 13:11.030
This room faces north so
it's always chilly and dark

13:11.125 --> 13:14.697
it gets sunlight only once a day.
From over there

13:16.958 --> 13:18.518
the sunlight hits the Seoul tower window

13:18.542 --> 13:20.999
and bounces into my room

13:21.333 --> 13:23.369
it's only for a brief moment.

13:23.458 --> 13:25.665
You have to get lucky to see it

13:29.625 --> 13:30.910
boil

13:32.750 --> 13:33.956
come on out

13:35.250 --> 13:36.490
boil

13:36.750 --> 13:38.411
your cat's name is boil

13:38.500 --> 13:40.741
yeah, boil

13:42.208 --> 13:44.745
I found him abandoned in the

13:44.833 --> 13:46.573
basement boiler room

13:48.042 --> 13:52.081
he never comes out when
strangers are around

13:52.958 --> 13:54.869
he has severe autism

13:56.000 --> 13:59.367
boil isn't just in your
imagination too, is he?

14:00.250 --> 14:02.241
Am I coming here to feed an imaginary cat?

14:02.333 --> 14:05.575
Am I coming here to feed an imaginary cat?

14:05.917 --> 14:07.184
You think I asked you to come here

14:07.208 --> 14:10.245
to feed an invisible cat

14:11.542 --> 14:12.827
that's funny

14:15.917 --> 14:19.865
should I forget that there "isn't" a cat?

14:23.167 --> 14:24.452
Do you remember that one time

14:24.750 --> 14:26.991
when you told me I was ugly

14:27.458 --> 14:30.165
really? I said that?

14:30.583 --> 14:33.165
One day, on my way home from school

14:33.250 --> 14:36.447
you crossed the street and told me

14:37.333 --> 14:39.540
"you are really ugly"

14:41.458 --> 14:45.121
it was the only thing you ever
said to me in junior high

14:48.750 --> 14:50.911
now speak the truth

14:54.917 --> 14:56.453
why don't you speak?

16:40.750 --> 16:42.035
Wait

16:56.667 --> 16:57.667
Put it on

22:03.458 --> 22:06.871
What? Moo

22:33.333 --> 22:34.573
Hello

22:36.792 --> 22:38.077
hello

22:42.792 --> 22:44.077
hello

24:04.708 --> 24:09.372
Recent figures prove the severity of

24:09.458 --> 24:11.198
our country's youth unemployment

24:11.292 --> 24:12.953
it is growing at the fastest rate among

24:13.042 --> 24:15.624
oecd member countries

24:15.708 --> 24:17.824
we have reporter park seongho to explain

24:18.083 --> 24:20.415
the growth of our unemployment rate

24:20.500 --> 24:23.992
is the fastest within the oecd

24:25.125 --> 24:28.538
trump claims that he set
a new vision for America

24:39.125 --> 24:42.117
A poll by the Washington post

24:42.208 --> 24:45.496
and abc found that 94% of trump voters

24:45.583 --> 24:46.914
hello

24:49.917 --> 24:52.101
he was awarded high marks for fulfilling
his campaign promises

24:52.125 --> 24:53.559
such as immigrant deportation,
the Mexico border wall

24:53.583 --> 24:57.952
and abolishing Obama care. "I also took action
to reform" "our immigration system, so it puts-"

28:16.042 --> 28:18.749
Boil, where are you?

28:19.167 --> 28:21.032
Boil, where are you?

28:21.125 --> 28:27.576
Come out, come out, wherever you are

28:35.750 --> 28:39.242
Aha! Look what we've got here

28:41.375 --> 28:44.287
what's this, Mr. boil

28:45.292 --> 28:51.208
if you wanted to hide, you
should've hidden your poop too

28:51.667 --> 28:54.830
you're introducing your poop first

28:55.583 --> 28:57.869
before a "nice to meet you"

30:38.958 --> 30:41.495
You will not be disadvantaged

30:41.583 --> 30:45.155
for denying your statement

30:45.250 --> 30:48.822
however, if you forfeit the
right to deny your statement

30:48.917 --> 30:53.581
your statement can be used
as proof of your guilt

30:53.667 --> 30:55.248
do you understand?

30:55.667 --> 30:56.497
Yes

30:56.583 --> 31:02.499
now. Would the prosecution
please state the arraignment?

31:02.583 --> 31:04.414
The defendant, a livestock worker

31:04.500 --> 31:07.116
injured a paju city government official

31:07.208 --> 31:08.038
obstructing the legitimate
execution of duty

31:08.125 --> 31:11.197
obstructing the legitimate
execution of duty

31:11.292 --> 31:12.934
and fracturing the government
official's right hand

31:12.958 --> 31:15.415
requiring six weeks of treatment

31:15.500 --> 31:17.991
fine. Did you receive the indictment

31:18.083 --> 31:21.871
including what you've just heard

31:22.000 --> 31:22.614
yes

31:22.708 --> 31:26.701
then do you accept the charges

31:26.792 --> 31:29.329
and do you have anything else to say

31:29.833 --> 31:32.540
the defendant accepts
all charges, your honor

31:32.625 --> 31:33.625
okay

31:33.708 --> 31:34.993
Mr. Lee

31:35.083 --> 31:37.449
do you agree with your
attorney's statement?

31:45.458 --> 31:47.073
Mr. Lee

31:55.625 --> 31:57.240
Finished college?

31:58.667 --> 31:59.667
Yes

32:00.042 --> 32:01.907
but you still don't have a job

32:03.250 --> 32:04.660
what was your major?

32:07.083 --> 32:09.369
I studied creative writing, sir.
Creative writing

32:09.458 --> 32:11.619
so you studied writing

32:13.125 --> 32:15.457
what kind of "writing" are
you going to "create"?

32:18.542 --> 32:19.782
I'm planning to write fiction

32:19.875 --> 32:21.115
fiction

32:21.667 --> 32:23.123
wow

32:24.750 --> 32:27.036
so, what kind of fiction
do you want to write?

32:27.458 --> 32:28.868
I'm not sure yet

32:31.250 --> 32:33.366
how about writing about your father?

32:34.417 --> 32:36.829
He's like a protagonist in a story

32:36.917 --> 32:39.624
he's like a protagonist in a story

32:39.708 --> 32:42.415
look at his life! So turbulent

32:43.500 --> 32:45.582
he was nuts back in the day...

32:46.042 --> 32:48.704
Aren't all protagonists nuts?

32:49.917 --> 32:51.532
He was number one in paju high

32:51.625 --> 32:53.616
not for his grades,

32:53.708 --> 32:56.541
but for his pride

33:00.208 --> 33:03.405
after he returned from
working in the middle east

33:03.500 --> 33:06.742
I told him to buy a house in gangnam

33:06.833 --> 33:08.994
it was a guaranteed profit

33:10.292 --> 33:13.329
but he didn't, because of his pride

33:13.708 --> 33:18.031
instead, he returns to paju and
becomes a livestock farmer

33:18.125 --> 33:19.911
and now he's broke and in jail

33:21.125 --> 33:23.116
even now

33:23.250 --> 33:27.323
he should apologize to the victim
and write a letter of apology

33:27.417 --> 33:30.955
he should submit a petition
to the judge for a reprieve

33:31.042 --> 33:33.784
but he's being stubborn

33:35.375 --> 33:37.832
he doesn't even listen to his lawyer

33:39.042 --> 33:41.374
that's why I wanted to see you

33:42.833 --> 33:46.030
visit your father and talk to him

33:46.125 --> 33:50.494
tell him to loosen his temper
and write that letter of apology

33:52.042 --> 33:53.873
immediately. Like tomorrow

33:55.583 --> 33:56.583
got it?

34:18.917 --> 34:20.782
Hey, it's me again

34:25.875 --> 34:27.786
Still not showing yourself?

34:27.875 --> 34:29.456
It's been over two weeks

35:48.458 --> 35:49.664
Hello

35:51.458 --> 35:52.743
hello

35:53.125 --> 35:54.331
hello

35:55.458 --> 35:57.870
I'm through! Hello

36:00.417 --> 36:01.998
it's me, haemi

36:04.167 --> 36:06.533
it was really hard making this call

36:06.625 --> 36:08.240
we might get disconnected

36:10.167 --> 36:13.955
I'm at the Nairobi airport in Kenya

36:14.042 --> 36:17.000
there was a bombing near the airport

36:17.083 --> 36:19.620
I have been stuck here for three days

36:19.708 --> 36:21.164
are you okay?

36:23.042 --> 36:26.990
Yeah, I'm okay. I think
it often happens here

36:27.083 --> 36:30.371
anyway, I finally have a flight out of here

36:30.708 --> 36:33.199
I arrive at 4pm tomorrow

36:33.292 --> 36:34.623
can you come to pick me up?

36:34.708 --> 36:37.666
I'll be there. For sure

36:41.042 --> 36:42.122
hello

36:51.417 --> 36:52.748
Lee jongsu

36:55.542 --> 36:56.577
you're here

36:56.958 --> 36:57.743
I'll take this

36:57.833 --> 37:01.997
Ben! This is my one and
only friend, Lee jongsu

37:02.792 --> 37:03.907
hi. I'm Ben

37:05.167 --> 37:07.123
we're Nairobi comrades

37:07.208 --> 37:11.156
we were at the Nairobi airport
together for 3 anxious days

37:11.417 --> 37:13.453
we were the only two Koreans there

37:16.208 --> 37:17.414
I'm hungry

37:18.250 --> 37:20.787
I slept through the flight
and didn't eat anything

37:20.875 --> 37:23.036
I want some Korean food

37:23.708 --> 37:25.494
like tripe stew

37:26.708 --> 37:28.198
does it have to be tripe stew?

37:28.292 --> 37:31.125
I've been craving for it

37:33.125 --> 37:35.958
I know the best tripe restaurant in Seoul

37:36.042 --> 37:37.042
really?

37:37.667 --> 37:39.578
Jongsu, let's go eat tripe stew

37:53.458 --> 37:54.914
Yeah, I'm on my way

37:56.417 --> 37:57.827
I'm in my friend's car

37:58.458 --> 38:00.198
he came to pick us up

38:02.542 --> 38:03.702
what?

38:05.208 --> 38:07.073
Yeah, I'm fine

38:07.917 --> 38:12.115
you know health is never an issue.
Thanks to the superior DNA.

38:26.417 --> 38:28.078
Come on

38:30.125 --> 38:32.081
wow... how can you be so naive

38:32.708 --> 38:35.245
you're old enough to know better

38:37.167 --> 38:39.158
you should keep a record of this

38:39.542 --> 38:42.614
this is an epic event
in the life of Ms. Kim

38:44.958 --> 38:46.118
yeah

38:48.000 --> 38:49.490
I miss you too

38:51.125 --> 38:52.125
okay

38:53.292 --> 38:54.998
I'll stop by sometime this week

38:57.125 --> 38:58.125
yeah.

38:58.750 --> 38:59.990
Okay, mom

39:08.125 --> 39:09.786
I joined the "sunset tour"

39:09.875 --> 39:12.582
on my way to the kalahari desert

39:14.250 --> 39:16.832
it's a program showing the desert sunset

39:17.417 --> 39:19.059
but it turned out to be just a parking lot

39:19.083 --> 39:22.496
there was nothing

39:22.583 --> 39:25.575
but trash tourists left behind

39:27.042 --> 39:30.489
everybody came with someone,
I was the only one by myself

39:31.500 --> 39:35.573
I suddenly felt all alone there

39:36.042 --> 39:40.615
I wondered why I was even there on my own

39:41.500 --> 39:45.618
then the sun started to set

39:45.708 --> 39:47.869
the sun was setting beyond

39:47.958 --> 39:50.199
the endless sand-covered horizon

39:50.792 --> 39:53.408
at first it was orange

39:54.458 --> 39:57.700
then it turned blood red

39:58.958 --> 40:03.076
then purple... and Navy

40:04.042 --> 40:05.953
it became dark as the sunset disappeared

40:06.042 --> 40:07.998
it became dark as the sunset disappeared

40:08.083 --> 40:10.916
and my eyes suddenly welled with tears

40:15.583 --> 40:17.995
"t must be at the end of the world."

40:25.875 --> 40:28.366
That's what I thought.

40:31.792 --> 40:34.864
I wanted to vanish just like that sunset.

40:41.958 --> 40:44.700
But I was afraid of dying.

40:48.792 --> 40:50.783
If only I could vanish

40:50.875 --> 40:53.491
like I never existed."

40:59.458 --> 41:02.200
It's fascinating to me when people cry

41:05.833 --> 41:08.996
fascinating? Why?

41:10.667 --> 41:15.036
Because I've never shed a
tear before in my life

41:15.958 --> 41:18.119
I suppose I did when I was little

41:18.458 --> 41:21.996
but I can't remember ever shedding a tear

41:22.625 --> 41:24.240
that is fascinating

41:26.042 --> 41:28.829
but you do feel sadness, don't you?

41:29.500 --> 41:31.206
Maybe, but

41:31.667 --> 41:33.749
as there are no tears,

41:33.833 --> 41:36.040
there's no telling what sadness is

41:39.625 --> 41:41.957
may I ask what you do for a living?

41:43.083 --> 41:45.699
Well, I do this and that

41:46.667 --> 41:48.828
you wouldn't understand even if I told you

41:49.708 --> 41:51.414
to put it simply

41:51.750 --> 41:53.741
I "play"

41:55.208 --> 41:56.288
you play?

41:56.417 --> 41:57.417
Yes

41:57.667 --> 41:59.828
nowadays, there is no distinction

41:59.917 --> 42:01.828
between working and playing

42:05.625 --> 42:06.990
may I ask

42:07.083 --> 42:09.916
who your favorite writer is?

42:14.125 --> 42:15.615
It's William faulkner

42:16.417 --> 42:17.623
ah, faulkner

42:18.958 --> 42:20.994
when I read his work

42:22.083 --> 42:24.369
it's like I'm reading my own story

42:27.250 --> 42:29.491
since you're writing stories

42:29.583 --> 42:32.416
I'd like to have a chat with you sometime

42:33.625 --> 42:35.411
I want to tell you my story

42:42.792 --> 42:43.907
Isn't she cute?

42:46.458 --> 42:49.871
She falls asleep anywhere when she's sleepy

42:50.500 --> 42:52.081
it doesn't even take 10 seconds

42:55.500 --> 42:57.240
hey, you're here! - Yeah

42:57.458 --> 42:59.369
I parked the car out front. - Thank you

42:59.708 --> 43:00.823
excuse me for a second

43:02.417 --> 43:04.123
did you step on it

43:04.500 --> 43:05.410
no

43:05.500 --> 43:08.458
I just quietly followed
you from the airport

43:08.542 --> 43:10.373
that's harder

43:10.458 --> 43:13.200
speeding up and slowing down

43:21.250 --> 43:24.572
Thanks. -You're welcome

43:25.208 --> 43:26.208
haemi...

43:26.667 --> 43:27.667
Haemi! Wake up

43:27.708 --> 43:29.039
it's time to go home

43:45.917 --> 43:47.532
Want me to take you home

43:50.667 --> 43:52.123
okay, sure

43:52.208 --> 43:53.948
I have a long way to go, anyway

43:58.292 --> 44:01.125
jongsu, it was nice meeting you

44:01.333 --> 44:02.698
likewise

45:40.792 --> 45:42.908
Say something

45:43.250 --> 45:44.831
if you've called, say something

45:44.917 --> 45:47.499
who's this and why call and say nothing?

46:25.833 --> 46:26.913
Dear honorable judge, '

46:27.000 --> 46:28.911
we are filing a petition

46:29.000 --> 46:31.161
for the defendant Lee yongsuk...'

46:31.250 --> 46:33.241
who is in jail for

46:33.333 --> 46:35.073
obstruction of justice, '

46:35.167 --> 46:37.032
'assault, and property damage.'

46:37.125 --> 46:39.525
Lee yongsuk was an honest farmer
and our friendly neighbor.'

46:44.042 --> 46:45.498
hello

46:49.292 --> 46:50.407
excuse me

46:50.500 --> 46:53.663
nobody home. What?

46:56.917 --> 46:58.782
What can I help you with?

47:01.500 --> 47:02.706
Is your husband home?

47:02.792 --> 47:04.123
No

47:07.583 --> 47:09.790
What's your business here?

47:11.417 --> 47:14.329
I'm here to get signatures for a petition

47:15.375 --> 47:16.706
he's not here

47:18.750 --> 47:21.207
I'l come back. -Yes

47:27.375 --> 47:29.741
Actually, I don't know
your father that well

47:30.125 --> 47:32.787
he didn't really interact with us

47:32.875 --> 47:36.868
and whatever he did, he always did alone

47:38.000 --> 47:40.286
sir, this is just a petition.

47:40.375 --> 47:43.162
It's not going to cause you trouble

47:43.333 --> 47:44.994
no, it's just this part

47:45.083 --> 47:50.749
“Lee yongsuk was an honest farmer
and our friendly neighbor.”

47:51.208 --> 47:54.325
Frankly, he was never friendly

47:54.625 --> 47:55.831
sorry about that

47:56.375 --> 47:57.831
you write very well

48:04.292 --> 48:08.410
Sir, we have an extra calf at our house

48:08.500 --> 48:10.018
do you know anyone who'd want to buy it?

48:10.042 --> 48:12.203
A calf? -Yes

48:12.792 --> 48:14.282
boy or girl

48:14.583 --> 48:15.823
a girl

48:16.458 --> 48:18.323
I'll have to ask around

48:28.208 --> 48:29.243
Hello

49:16.083 --> 49:17.448
Is someone else here?

49:36.167 --> 49:38.123
Good to see you again, jongsu

49:40.875 --> 49:43.116
haemi wanted to see you

49:43.542 --> 49:46.249
no, Ben kept asking me to call you

49:47.083 --> 49:48.744
did you have trouble finding this place?

49:49.458 --> 49:52.074
No. It's easy with Google map

49:52.583 --> 49:55.074
this is Ben's neighborhood

49:57.625 --> 49:59.616
it's nice

50:00.458 --> 50:01.618
it's quiet

50:03.500 --> 50:04.785
keep going

50:05.542 --> 50:07.658
Ben was reading my palm

50:11.167 --> 50:15.706
haemi, you have something different

50:19.792 --> 50:21.032
what's that?

50:23.542 --> 50:25.248
There's something in your heart

50:25.750 --> 50:27.240
a stone

50:28.708 --> 50:31.040
the stone makes you suffer

50:32.375 --> 50:33.990
that's why you can't fully enjoy things

50:34.083 --> 50:36.790
that's why you can't fully enjoy things

50:39.792 --> 50:41.226
that's why you can't appreciate tasty food

50:41.250 --> 50:43.992
that's why you can't appreciate tasty food

50:44.708 --> 50:48.826
or why you can't tell a guy you like him

50:53.958 --> 50:55.744
Then what should I do?

50:57.625 --> 50:58.910
You need to remove the stone

50:59.167 --> 51:00.532
you want me to do it?

51:01.417 --> 51:03.328
You can do that?

51:03.833 --> 51:05.243
Just trust me.

51:08.042 --> 51:09.373
Hold my hand

51:12.542 --> 51:13.873
and close your eyes

51:23.125 --> 51:24.456
Now open your hand

51:29.542 --> 51:30.827
What's this?

51:30.917 --> 51:32.873
What do you think? It's a stone

51:32.958 --> 51:35.244
I took it out of your heart

51:35.708 --> 51:37.539
where did you get this?

51:37.625 --> 51:39.957
Back there from the flower bed

51:40.542 --> 51:41.907
to do this? -Yeah

51:42.000 --> 51:44.457
you brought one back to do this? -Yeah

51:44.542 --> 51:45.748
what for?

51:45.833 --> 51:47.289
For fun

51:47.750 --> 51:49.832
I'll do anything for fun

51:55.458 --> 51:56.618
Jongsu

51:57.583 --> 51:58.993
do you like pasta?

51:59.750 --> 52:00.750
What?

52:01.292 --> 52:04.079
Ben says he's going to
cook us pasta at his place

52:06.250 --> 52:08.741
hello. -How was your trip back home?

52:08.833 --> 52:11.119
Great, thanks to you

52:18.333 --> 52:19.493
Hello.

52:47.250 --> 52:49.707
Ben, you're really good

52:50.708 --> 52:53.199
I envy people who cook well

52:55.333 --> 52:56.413
jongsu

52:57.292 --> 52:58.657
can you cook too?

53:00.000 --> 53:01.911
I guess, since I live alone

53:03.042 --> 53:04.828
but I can only make a few dishes

53:07.500 --> 53:09.161
I like to cook

53:09.875 --> 53:13.663
because I can make what
I want, in any way I want

53:15.792 --> 53:19.785
what's better is that I get to eat it

53:20.375 --> 53:22.957
just as humans make offerings to the gods

53:24.500 --> 53:26.912
I make my own offering

53:27.000 --> 53:28.661
and consume it.

53:29.458 --> 53:30.493
Offering

53:31.542 --> 53:35.706
an offering. It's just a metaphor

53:37.083 --> 53:38.664
a metaphor of what?

53:39.792 --> 53:41.703
A metaphor of...

53:42.000 --> 53:43.661
Well, ask jongsu

53:50.167 --> 53:51.907
Haemi. -Hmm

53:52.833 --> 53:54.198
do you know where the bathroom is?

53:55.417 --> 53:57.783
Ben, where's the bathroom?

53:58.583 --> 53:59.743
Across the hallway

55:39.750 --> 55:41.706
How much older is he than me?

55:43.458 --> 55:46.165
Six or seven years?

55:47.458 --> 55:50.120
How does he get to live
like this at his age?

55:50.917 --> 55:55.081
Travelling abroad, driving a Porsche,

55:56.625 --> 55:58.707
listening to music while cooking pasta

55:59.292 --> 56:01.658
I guess he's just young and rich

56:03.625 --> 56:05.081
he's the great gatsby?

56:06.042 --> 56:07.248
What do you mean?

56:09.167 --> 56:12.204
Mysterious people who are young and rich

56:12.833 --> 56:15.495
but you don't know what they really do

56:17.500 --> 56:19.832
there are so many gatsbys in Korea

56:26.667 --> 56:29.989
Why do you think he's seeing you?

56:30.083 --> 56:32.415
Ever think about that?

56:38.792 --> 56:41.124
Ben says he just likes people like me

56:43.708 --> 56:45.073
he says I'm interesting

56:58.917 --> 57:01.158
Hi. -Hey guys

57:01.250 --> 57:02.740
hello

57:02.875 --> 57:06.948
this is my new friend, Lee jongsu

57:07.250 --> 57:08.250
he writes

57:08.333 --> 57:09.914
so you're a writer?

57:10.500 --> 57:14.038
I'm not published yet. I'm
just writing at the moment

57:14.125 --> 57:15.956
when you write, you're a writer

57:16.042 --> 57:17.309
a "writer" is someone who writes

57:17.333 --> 57:19.540
Ben, it was just a question

57:21.333 --> 57:22.914
I'm going inside

57:24.375 --> 57:25.375
me too

57:40.750 --> 57:42.035
At nightfall,

57:42.125 --> 57:46.118
the bushmen would light a
bonfire and dance around it

57:46.292 --> 57:48.874
they've been doing this
since a long time ago.

57:48.958 --> 57:54.203
The oldest and wisest lady plays the drums.

57:54.292 --> 57:57.204
Then everybody dances to its rhythm

57:57.542 --> 58:00.158
at first, they stretch
their arms to the ground

58:01.250 --> 58:02.365
like this

58:02.583 --> 58:04.790
this is the little hunger dance

58:06.542 --> 58:08.749
the dance of the people who are hungry

58:09.208 --> 58:10.948
and as they go on,

58:11.042 --> 58:16.287
their arms slowly reach towards the sky

58:18.917 --> 58:21.624
this is the great hunger dance

58:23.417 --> 58:25.874
the dance which seeks the meaning of life

58:28.750 --> 58:33.665
they dance from early evening
till deep into the night

58:33.750 --> 58:39.120
as they dance, little hunger gradually
turns into great hunger

58:41.833 --> 58:44.825
I can't explain it in words

58:45.875 --> 58:47.456
you need to see it for yourselves

58:47.708 --> 58:49.699
then show us

58:51.875 --> 58:53.786
really? -Yeah

58:54.958 --> 58:57.074
show us! It sounds interesting

58:59.500 --> 59:01.456
okay. I'll try

59:01.958 --> 59:03.664
but I need a beat

59:03.750 --> 59:06.617
please clap your hands. Like this

59:47.458 --> 59:50.291
And slowly it turns into great hunger

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:27.042
One little calf is sitting on
a hot pot bursting into tears

01:01:27.208 --> 01:01:32.328
help, mom! Help, dad

01:01:32.417 --> 01:01:36.410
oh, my butt is burning up

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:43.372
one little calf is sitting on an
ice cube bursting into tears

01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:49.072
help, mom! Help, dad

01:01:52.458 --> 01:01:53.823
hello

01:01:53.917 --> 01:01:57.580
jongsu, are you home?

01:01:58.292 --> 01:02:00.704
Yeah, I'm home

01:02:00.792 --> 01:02:02.578
I knew you'd be home

01:02:03.042 --> 01:02:07.035
listen, I'm heading there now with Ben

01:02:07.417 --> 01:02:08.202
here? What for?

01:02:08.292 --> 01:02:10.783
We were driving by

01:02:10.875 --> 01:02:12.911
and when I told him I used to live here

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.286
he wanted to stop by

01:02:15.375 --> 01:02:18.697
we're almost there

01:03:09.042 --> 01:03:10.657
What's that sound?

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:17.575
That's the north Korean
propaganda broadcast

01:03:18.417 --> 01:03:21.909
North Korea is right over there

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:25.407
how fun

01:03:28.042 --> 01:03:30.749
it's disappointing that
my old house is gone

01:03:31.792 --> 01:03:34.204
it used to be right over there

01:03:35.167 --> 01:03:36.748
now it's gone without a trace

01:03:37.833 --> 01:03:39.824
and the well is gone too

01:03:42.917 --> 01:03:45.499
there used to be a well near our house

01:03:46.417 --> 01:03:48.783
I fell into it when I was little

01:03:50.375 --> 01:03:51.740
do you remember?

01:03:56.667 --> 01:03:58.407
You fell into a well?

01:03:58.708 --> 01:03:59.948
How old were you?

01:04:01.167 --> 01:04:02.748
Maybe when I was seven

01:04:03.792 --> 01:04:06.625
I fell in when I was by myself

01:04:07.292 --> 01:04:11.285
I was looking up from below
and crying for hours

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:14.869
I was terrified that

01:04:14.958 --> 01:04:17.290
I'd die if nobody found me

01:04:19.042 --> 01:04:20.953
but then his face appeared

01:04:22.208 --> 01:04:25.075
jongsu found me and I was rescued

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.831
but he doesn't even remember

01:04:31.583 --> 01:04:33.198
I brought some food

01:04:33.875 --> 01:04:34.875
okay

01:05:04.708 --> 01:05:06.824
It's like I'm at home

01:05:08.333 --> 01:05:09.823
my old place

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.456
This isn't bad

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.956
except for the smell of cowpat

01:05:38.125 --> 01:05:39.365
I feel good

01:05:41.167 --> 01:05:43.533
this may be my best day ever

01:06:08.458 --> 01:06:10.414
I feel like smoking pot

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:11.956
want to join me?

01:06:13.292 --> 01:06:14.407
Pot?

01:06:14.792 --> 01:06:16.077
Marijuana

01:06:18.292 --> 01:06:20.783
I always giggle when I smoke that

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.538
I hate my father

01:13:20.625 --> 01:13:25.949
my father has an anger disorder

01:13:26.792 --> 01:13:29.374
he has rage bottled up inside of him.

01:13:29.458 --> 01:13:31.574
It goes off like a bomb

01:13:32.458 --> 01:13:35.996
once it goes off, everything gets destroyed

01:13:38.250 --> 01:13:44.826
my mom left my sister and me because of it

01:13:51.458 --> 01:13:57.533
The day my mom left, I
burned all her clothes

01:14:00.125 --> 01:14:03.492
my father made a fire in the yard

01:14:04.708 --> 01:14:09.782
and had me burn them with my own hands

01:14:15.542 --> 01:14:18.284
I still have dreams about that night

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:26.242
sometimes I burn down greenhouses

01:14:27.958 --> 01:14:29.289
excuse me?

01:14:29.917 --> 01:14:32.249
I said sometimes I burn down greenhouses

01:14:35.333 --> 01:14:38.245
I have a hobby of burning greenhouses

01:14:40.083 --> 01:14:44.952
I choose an abandoned
greenhouse and set it on fire

01:14:45.042 --> 01:14:46.873
once every two months

01:14:48.333 --> 01:14:50.949
I think that's the best rhythm

01:14:51.458 --> 01:14:52.868
for me

01:14:54.583 --> 01:14:55.993
rhythm

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.037
so you burn down other people's greenhouses

01:15:01.917 --> 01:15:03.748
of course

01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:07.366
it's a crime, so to speak

01:15:08.833 --> 01:15:11.905
just like how you and I
are smoking this pot

01:15:12.958 --> 01:15:14.869
it's clearly a crime

01:15:18.667 --> 01:15:20.783
it's very simple though

01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:25.447
you spray kerosene then throw a lit match

01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:27.250
that's it

01:15:29.375 --> 01:15:31.912
it takes less than 10
minutes to burn it all down

01:15:34.542 --> 01:15:37.500
you can make it disappear

01:15:38.042 --> 01:15:39.873
as if it never existed

01:15:41.583 --> 01:15:43.574
what if you get caught?

01:15:43.667 --> 01:15:46.500
I won't. Never

01:15:48.083 --> 01:15:51.655
the Korean police don't care
about those sort of things

01:15:53.167 --> 01:15:54.657
in Korea

01:15:56.125 --> 01:15:58.491
there are tons of greenhouses

01:16:00.167 --> 01:16:04.866
useless, filthy,
unpleasant-looking greenhouses

01:16:05.833 --> 01:16:09.906
it's like they're all waiting
for me to burn them down

01:16:10.875 --> 01:16:15.118
and as I watch them burn to the ground

01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:17.990
I feel ecstatic

01:16:19.583 --> 01:16:21.323
and from here

01:16:22.875 --> 01:16:24.866
I feel a low hum right here

01:16:26.708 --> 01:16:29.074
a hum that shakes the very core of the soul

01:16:32.708 --> 01:16:36.701
and you judge whether
they're useless or not?

01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:40.332
I don't judge anything

01:16:41.083 --> 01:16:42.914
I merely accept it

01:16:46.375 --> 01:16:48.991
I accept they're waiting to be burned down

01:16:56.583 --> 01:16:58.494
It's like rain

01:17:00.667 --> 01:17:02.077
rain falls

01:17:02.958 --> 01:17:04.664
the river overflows

01:17:05.375 --> 01:17:09.288
causing a flood that sweeps people away

01:17:12.625 --> 01:17:14.411
you think the rain judges anything?

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.241
There is no right or wrong

01:17:19.042 --> 01:17:21.078
there are no morals to nature

01:17:23.208 --> 01:17:25.288
if we have to talk about its
morals, there's only...

01:17:26.583 --> 01:17:28.448
Simultaneous existence

01:17:29.667 --> 01:17:31.248
simultaneous existence

01:17:32.250 --> 01:17:35.572
I'm here, and I'm also there

01:17:36.542 --> 01:17:40.114
I'm in paju, and I'm in banpo

01:17:41.125 --> 01:17:42.865
I'm in Seoul

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:44.789
at the same time, I'm in Africa

01:17:45.667 --> 01:17:46.998
something like that

01:17:47.792 --> 01:17:49.328
that kind of balance

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.707
When was the last time you
burned a greenhouse down?

01:17:59.250 --> 01:18:00.365
Well

01:18:00.458 --> 01:18:03.200
it was right before I left for Africa

01:18:03.458 --> 01:18:05.244
so almost two months ago

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.457
which means it's about time for another one

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:15.163
then you must've decided
which one would be next

01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:18.323
I have

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.740
a great one to burn down

01:18:23.458 --> 01:18:26.495
I can almost feel the
joy of burning it down

01:18:28.542 --> 01:18:29.702
to be honest

01:18:30.583 --> 01:18:32.665
I came here to scout

01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:35.536
scout?

01:18:36.875 --> 01:18:38.661
Does that mean it's nearby?

01:18:38.875 --> 01:18:39.875
That's right

01:18:42.667 --> 01:18:44.749
it's close

01:18:46.667 --> 01:18:48.703
very, very close

01:18:58.042 --> 01:19:01.205
I'm in love with haemi

01:19:12.292 --> 01:19:15.409
Fuck... I said I love her

01:19:50.375 --> 01:19:52.206
This tree has gotten really big

01:19:54.542 --> 01:19:57.739
why do you undress so
easily in front of men

01:20:01.167 --> 01:20:03.749
only whores do that

01:20:15.625 --> 01:20:18.992
I'll keep an eye out for the greenhouses

01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:20.910
you do that

01:20:21.042 --> 01:20:22.953
ones that are really near

01:22:47.917 --> 01:22:51.580
Your call cannot be answered at the moment

01:22:51.667 --> 01:22:53.587
you'll be redirected to
voicemail after the beep

01:22:56.292 --> 01:22:59.159
haemi. Please answer your phone

01:23:08.667 --> 01:23:09.952
Come in

01:23:10.417 --> 01:23:11.953
this way

01:23:21.208 --> 01:23:23.369
State your number from left to right

01:23:23.458 --> 01:23:25.619
one! -Two

01:23:26.958 --> 01:23:27.958
three

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:28.910
four

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.331
five. -Six

01:23:30.417 --> 01:23:31.998
seven! End of number

01:23:32.292 --> 01:23:33.657
where do you live, no. 1

01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:35.536
I live in paju city. It's 5 minutes away

01:23:35.625 --> 01:23:36.934
can you work nights or after hours?

01:23:36.958 --> 01:23:37.993
Yes I can, sir

01:23:38.083 --> 01:23:39.539
where do you live, no. 2

01:23:39.625 --> 01:23:41.081
buchun, sir

01:23:41.167 --> 01:23:44.489
how are you going to come from buchun?
It takes 2 hours

01:23:44.583 --> 01:23:45.868
no problem, sir. I can do it

01:23:45.958 --> 01:23:47.949
where do you live, no. 3

01:23:50.083 --> 01:23:51.869
where do you live, no. 3

01:24:01.292 --> 01:24:02.748
Okay, no. 4. - Yes, sir

01:24:02.833 --> 01:24:04.824
where do you live? - Munsan, sir

01:24:04.917 --> 01:24:06.317
can you work nights or after hours?

01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:07.490
Yes I can, sir

01:25:41.083 --> 01:25:45.656
Road atlas of paju city'

01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:52.870
Haemi'

01:26:54.333 --> 01:26:55.539
hello

01:27:02.667 --> 01:27:03.827
Hello

01:29:03.917 --> 01:29:07.580
Your call cannot be answered at the moment

01:29:07.667 --> 01:29:10.033
you'll be redirected to
voicemail after the beep

01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:04.458
What are you doing?

01:31:04.542 --> 01:31:05.622
Pardon?

01:31:05.875 --> 01:31:07.160
I said what are you doing

01:31:07.792 --> 01:31:09.453
I'm just looking

01:32:06.958 --> 01:32:11.531
The number you have dialed
has been switched off

01:32:11.625 --> 01:32:13.661
you'll be redirected to
voicemail after the beep

01:32:18.042 --> 01:32:20.954
haemi! Shin haemi

01:32:22.583 --> 01:32:23.868
what's wrong?

01:32:25.375 --> 01:32:26.410
Hello, ma'am

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:29.286
I can't seem to reach haemi

01:32:31.542 --> 01:32:33.703
I need to get in

01:32:33.792 --> 01:32:35.783
I have to feed the cat

01:32:36.583 --> 01:32:38.790
it might starve to death

01:32:39.042 --> 01:32:40.907
there is no cat

01:32:41.125 --> 01:32:43.832
we don't allow tenants to have pets

01:32:44.917 --> 01:32:46.908
there is a cat

01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:50.082
I used to come to feed it

01:32:53.542 --> 01:32:55.282
you have a master key, right?

01:32:56.583 --> 01:33:00.405
You can't ask me to open the door like that

01:33:00.542 --> 01:33:03.124
at times like this, I'll get into trouble

01:33:25.292 --> 01:33:27.248
I told you there's no cat

01:33:28.792 --> 01:33:31.374
she seems to have gone on a trip

01:33:31.792 --> 01:33:34.158
the room's been tidied up

01:33:36.125 --> 01:33:38.787
she's not the type of person
that would do the cleaning

01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:58.991
I don't think she went on a trip

01:34:03.792 --> 01:34:08.741
welcome to the crop festival

01:34:08.833 --> 01:34:10.073
they all seem fine,

01:34:10.167 --> 01:34:11.907
but you never really know their story

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.956
in credit card debt

01:34:14.042 --> 01:34:17.330
and they eventually go into hiding

01:34:17.667 --> 01:34:21.159
haemi is the same. Her
phone's suddenly dead.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.572
Frankly, women need to spend
money on a lot of things

01:34:28.917 --> 01:34:30.623
it's difficult being a woman

01:34:30.708 --> 01:34:32.949
it's a problem if you wear make-up

01:34:33.042 --> 01:34:35.158
and a problem if you don't

01:34:35.250 --> 01:34:37.832
it's a problem if you
wear revealing clothes

01:34:37.917 --> 01:34:41.080
but also if you don't dress up

01:34:41.625 --> 01:34:43.206
have you heard of the saying

01:34:46.667 --> 01:34:48.498
"no country for women"

01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:55.500
What?

01:34:56.458 --> 01:34:57.458
Nothing

01:35:05.375 --> 01:35:09.789
Come visit us and enjoy our food

01:36:51.417 --> 01:36:52.623
Shit

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:26.785
Ben

01:38:29.625 --> 01:38:31.081
what brings you here?

01:38:33.375 --> 01:38:37.323
I was passing by and saw your car outside

01:38:37.625 --> 01:38:39.832
I thought it might be yours

01:38:39.917 --> 01:38:40.917
is that so?

01:38:41.583 --> 01:38:42.823
Have a seat

01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:44.956
may I?

01:38:46.375 --> 01:38:48.115
Do you want to order something?

01:38:48.417 --> 01:38:49.417
It's okay

01:38:49.458 --> 01:38:52.120
I have to leave soon

01:38:58.083 --> 01:38:59.744
Are you still working on your story?

01:39:00.417 --> 01:39:02.078
I'm trying

01:39:03.333 --> 01:39:06.700
you said you liked faulkner

01:39:06.792 --> 01:39:08.783
so I wanted to give him a shot

01:39:12.542 --> 01:39:15.909
come to think of it, I was wondering

01:39:18.333 --> 01:39:20.119
what happened to the greenhouse?

01:39:20.583 --> 01:39:22.949
Ah, the greenhouse

01:39:23.333 --> 01:39:25.198
you still remember that

01:39:26.583 --> 01:39:27.948
I burned it down, of course

01:39:29.208 --> 01:39:30.823
without a trace

01:39:32.083 --> 01:39:33.493
I said I would

01:39:35.833 --> 01:39:37.289
near my house?

01:39:37.875 --> 01:39:38.910
Of course

01:39:39.625 --> 01:39:41.115
very near

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.115
when?

01:39:48.292 --> 01:39:51.250
The collected short stories
of William faulkner!

01:39:51.333 --> 01:39:55.827
A day or two after I stopped by your place

01:39:58.333 --> 01:39:59.664
that's strange

01:40:01.250 --> 01:40:04.993
ever since that day, I've
been checking every morning

01:40:05.125 --> 01:40:09.619
I checked every single
greenhouse near my place

01:40:11.083 --> 01:40:14.155
you checked the greenhouses every day?

01:40:15.250 --> 01:40:18.037
Yes, every single one

01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:23.708
if any of them had burned down,
I couldn't have missed it

01:40:26.708 --> 01:40:28.198
yet, you have

01:40:29.958 --> 01:40:31.289
it happens

01:40:32.167 --> 01:40:34.249
maybe you missed it
because it was too close

01:40:35.958 --> 01:40:37.118
I don't think so

01:40:39.917 --> 01:40:41.453
how strange

01:40:44.083 --> 01:40:47.655
sometimes you can't see things
that are too close to you

01:40:49.542 --> 01:40:50.577
Ben

01:40:52.042 --> 01:40:55.034
sorry I'm late

01:40:55.458 --> 01:40:58.370
something came up at the store

01:40:58.458 --> 01:41:00.369
it drove me crazy

01:41:00.458 --> 01:41:01.618
it's okay

01:41:02.250 --> 01:41:03.160
but we're running late.

01:41:03.250 --> 01:41:05.616
So no time for tea

01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:07.990
nice to meet you

01:41:12.708 --> 01:41:14.539
by the way, are you in touch with haemi?

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.286
I can't seem to reach her.
It's been a month

01:41:17.833 --> 01:41:18.913
is that so?

01:41:19.250 --> 01:41:20.865
I can't seem to reach her, either

01:41:21.667 --> 01:41:23.077
haemi just

01:41:23.333 --> 01:41:25.119
disappeared like a puff of smoke

01:41:31.292 --> 01:41:34.284
Did haemi say anything to you?

01:41:34.375 --> 01:41:35.706
Like what?

01:41:38.292 --> 01:41:40.829
Like wanting to go on a trip

01:41:41.125 --> 01:41:42.160
or maybe

01:41:43.333 --> 01:41:46.700
I'm not sure, but I doubt
she went on a trip

01:41:47.125 --> 01:41:48.911
she can't afford it

01:41:49.375 --> 01:41:53.368
as far as I know, she's broke

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.457
she's not in touch with her family

01:41:56.542 --> 01:41:57.827
and doesn't have any friends

01:41:58.875 --> 01:42:02.367
haemi is lonelier than she seems

01:42:07.708 --> 01:42:11.121
Jongsu, you know what?

01:42:12.917 --> 01:42:15.329
Actually, haemi thought
of you as someone special

01:42:17.250 --> 01:42:18.706
she told me so

01:42:19.958 --> 01:42:23.280
she said you are the only
person in this world she trusts

01:42:24.333 --> 01:42:26.665
and that you're the only
one that's on her side

01:42:29.083 --> 01:42:33.247
it made me jealous for some reason

01:42:34.375 --> 01:42:37.572
I've never been jealous in my life

01:43:22.375 --> 01:43:23.535
Jongsu

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.456
are you jongsu?

01:43:26.833 --> 01:43:27.833
Yes

01:43:28.375 --> 01:43:29.740
he is

01:43:29.958 --> 01:43:31.698
you haven't changed one bit

01:43:32.458 --> 01:43:33.994
how have you been?

01:43:38.667 --> 01:43:40.578
What brings you here?

01:43:40.875 --> 01:43:42.706
Did haemi send you?

01:43:43.083 --> 01:43:44.163
No

01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:46.740
Haemi

01:43:48.375 --> 01:43:50.957
you couldn't have just stopped
here by chance, right?

01:43:53.292 --> 01:43:54.327
Eat

01:43:54.667 --> 01:43:55.667
yes, ma'am

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.740
I heard sujin got married

01:43:58.542 --> 01:44:00.453
yes, she has kids as well

01:44:00.542 --> 01:44:01.542
right

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.831
are you in touch with your mother?

01:44:10.083 --> 01:44:11.083
No

01:44:13.833 --> 01:44:16.290
I'm guessing that haemi sent you here?

01:44:17.125 --> 01:44:18.786
So tell her

01:44:19.375 --> 01:44:22.333
she can't return until she
pays off her credit card debts

01:44:28.417 --> 01:44:29.748
By the way

01:44:30.875 --> 01:44:32.536
do you remember

01:44:33.333 --> 01:44:35.699
when haemi fell into a well

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000
a well?

01:44:37.667 --> 01:44:39.157
Did that happen?

01:44:40.208 --> 01:44:42.199
When she was seven

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.036
she fell into a well

01:44:49.167 --> 01:44:53.911
she cried for hours down
at the bottom of the well

01:44:57.125 --> 01:44:59.741
crying and looking upwards

01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:04.491
hoping someone could help her

01:45:05.125 --> 01:45:09.118
but could only see the round sky

01:45:15.125 --> 01:45:16.331
I'm sorry

01:45:18.167 --> 01:45:24.743
I was just thinking about
how haemi must have felt

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.911
That never happened

01:45:32.292 --> 01:45:34.874
if it did, why didn't we know about it?

01:45:36.542 --> 01:45:38.032
Is that what haemi told you?

01:45:41.167 --> 01:45:43.032
She's very good at telling stories

01:45:44.167 --> 01:45:45.907
and those stories can be very convincing

01:45:47.708 --> 01:45:50.165
there wasn't even a well near our house

01:46:25.417 --> 01:46:27.157
Good morning, sir

01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:32.286
I have a question

01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:35.458
was there a well here?

01:46:35.708 --> 01:46:36.708
A well?

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Yes

01:46:38.125 --> 01:46:41.117
a well deep enough to fall into

01:46:42.375 --> 01:46:46.118
I'm not sure. I don't think so

01:49:31.875 --> 01:49:35.697
Through him, and with him, and in him

01:49:35.792 --> 01:49:39.205
o god, almighty father, in
the unity of the holy spirit

01:49:39.292 --> 01:49:44.912
all glory and honor is
yours, forever and ever

01:57:13.667 --> 01:57:15.032
Hello

01:57:17.417 --> 01:57:18.748
jongsu

01:57:21.958 --> 01:57:23.448
jongsu... right?

01:57:25.208 --> 01:57:26.208
Yes

01:57:27.667 --> 01:57:29.373
it's mom

01:57:35.208 --> 01:57:38.575
They kept phoning, came to my place

01:57:38.667 --> 01:57:39.782
and even charged into the

01:57:39.875 --> 01:57:43.242
department store that I worked at

01:57:44.708 --> 01:57:47.324
wearing their black suits...
Looking like the grim reapers

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:51.991
all that trouble for just 5 million

01:57:52.750 --> 01:57:56.663
if I were younger, I'd sell my organs

01:57:58.250 --> 01:57:59.535
look what I'm saying to the son

01:57:59.625 --> 01:58:02.947
I haven't met for 16 years

01:58:16.333 --> 01:58:17.664
I'll take care of it

01:58:18.833 --> 01:58:19.833
what?

01:58:21.625 --> 01:58:23.411
I'll take care of it

01:58:24.458 --> 01:58:25.743
don't worry

01:58:27.167 --> 01:58:30.239
you have money? No way you'd have the money

01:58:44.208 --> 01:58:45.243
Mom

01:58:46.333 --> 01:58:47.333
yeah?

01:58:52.958 --> 01:58:57.782
Remember haemi's place in
the middle of the village?

01:58:59.417 --> 01:59:01.078
Was there a well nearby?

01:59:01.250 --> 01:59:02.285
A well?

01:59:03.208 --> 01:59:06.041
Yes there was. A dried up well

01:59:08.333 --> 01:59:09.368
really?

01:59:11.083 --> 01:59:13.290
Haemi said she fell into it once

01:59:13.542 --> 01:59:16.158
I don't know about that.
But there was a well

01:59:18.542 --> 01:59:19.702
what's wrong?

02:00:12.750 --> 02:00:13.956
Hello

02:00:14.208 --> 02:00:16.199
jongsu, where are you?

02:00:18.458 --> 02:00:19.698
I'm in gangham

02:00:20.667 --> 02:00:22.032
where in gangnam?

02:00:24.625 --> 02:00:25.990
Let's see

02:00:33.375 --> 02:00:37.368
I thought this truck looked familiar

02:00:38.750 --> 02:00:40.115
what brings you here?

02:00:40.292 --> 02:00:41.532
Are you here to see me?

02:00:45.417 --> 02:00:47.783
Actually, I'm here to ask about haemi

02:00:48.625 --> 02:00:50.411
you could've just called

02:00:54.375 --> 02:00:56.366
since you're here, let's talk inside

02:00:56.958 --> 02:00:58.914
park the car in our building

02:01:26.292 --> 02:01:27.828
Going up

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:42.206
Nice timing, actually

02:01:43.292 --> 02:01:46.705
my friends are coming over
for dinner and drinks

02:01:47.042 --> 02:01:48.657
join us

02:01:49.292 --> 02:01:52.364
you've already met them, so it'll be okay

02:01:53.042 --> 02:01:54.373
4th floor

02:01:54.458 --> 02:01:56.039
are you having a party?

02:01:56.167 --> 02:02:00.240
Not really, more like a gathering

02:02:00.583 --> 02:02:01.743
a casual gathering

02:02:16.208 --> 02:02:19.951
You must have a lot to prepare
since there are many guests

02:02:21.333 --> 02:02:22.333
not really

02:02:22.792 --> 02:02:24.623
it's a potluck party

02:02:24.750 --> 02:02:27.036
so everyone brings food

02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:30.832
I just prepare the drinks
and some finger food

02:02:32.417 --> 02:02:34.703
someone was supposed to come early to help

02:02:35.125 --> 02:02:36.445
but I guess she's running late

02:02:37.542 --> 02:02:38.907
what's that sound

02:02:41.208 --> 02:02:42.664
oh, I have a cat

02:02:45.125 --> 02:02:46.706
you didn't have one last time

02:02:46.792 --> 02:02:47.792
right

02:02:48.417 --> 02:02:51.489
I brought a stray cat home not long ago

02:02:51.708 --> 02:02:53.118
it's a pretty cat

02:03:00.250 --> 02:03:01.831
It's really cute

02:03:01.917 --> 02:03:02.917
isn't it?

02:03:04.667 --> 02:03:06.077
Do you like cats?

02:03:10.667 --> 02:03:11.747
What's its name?

02:03:13.417 --> 02:03:14.417
I haven't named it yet

02:03:15.333 --> 02:03:18.325
it's more difficult than I thought.

02:03:23.792 --> 02:03:25.953
Jongsu, what kind of story are you writing?

02:03:27.333 --> 02:03:28.789
If you don't mind me asking

02:03:31.667 --> 02:03:34.579
I don't know what to write yet

02:03:35.583 --> 02:03:36.583
how come?

02:03:39.417 --> 02:03:40.657
To me

02:03:42.125 --> 02:03:44.081
the world is still a mystery

02:03:50.250 --> 02:03:51.786
Excuse me, can I use your bathroom?

02:05:13.625 --> 02:05:14.625
Sorry, Ben

02:05:14.708 --> 02:05:17.620
I meant to come sooner...

02:05:17.708 --> 02:05:19.414
What's all this?

02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:21.661
I bought a bit too much.

02:05:22.083 --> 02:05:23.518
Shut the door, or the cat will escape.

02:05:23.542 --> 02:05:26.705
Oh my! No!

02:05:26.792 --> 02:05:28.783
What do we do?

02:05:28.875 --> 02:05:30.957
Go catch it, of course.

02:05:31.042 --> 02:05:32.327
Where are you?

02:05:46.292 --> 02:05:47.623
Come out kitty.

02:05:50.250 --> 02:05:51.740
Hey, kitty.

02:05:55.250 --> 02:05:57.741
Where are you?

02:05:58.375 --> 02:05:59.706
Hey, kitty.

02:06:00.833 --> 02:06:02.243
Come here, little cat.

02:06:03.708 --> 02:06:04.993
Hey, kitty.

02:06:14.792 --> 02:06:16.123
Hey, kitty.

02:06:18.458 --> 02:06:20.039
Come here, little cat.

02:06:41.917 --> 02:06:43.032
Hey, kitty.

02:06:48.458 --> 02:06:49.743
Stay...

02:06:54.250 --> 02:06:55.740
Hey, kitty.

02:06:57.917 --> 02:06:59.373
Come here.

02:07:02.542 --> 02:07:03.873
Hey, kitty.

02:07:06.542 --> 02:07:08.157
Come here, kitty

02:07:09.625 --> 02:07:11.161
boil

02:07:12.208 --> 02:07:13.414
boil

02:07:17.708 --> 02:07:18.823
boil

02:07:26.542 --> 02:07:27.952
Hey, kitty.

02:07:31.708 --> 02:07:33.073
Wow, he caught it

02:07:36.042 --> 02:07:37.248
amazing

02:07:37.625 --> 02:07:39.286
how did you catch it so easily?

02:07:39.500 --> 02:07:41.036
It's very fast

02:07:41.542 --> 02:07:43.658
can I hold him?

02:07:48.917 --> 02:07:51.124
Did you all come out to greet us?

02:07:51.208 --> 02:07:52.789
Yeah

02:07:52.875 --> 02:07:54.035
with the cat

02:07:54.875 --> 02:07:56.115
hey guys

02:07:56.417 --> 02:07:58.703
how was traffic? -Awful

02:07:58.792 --> 02:08:00.373
hello

02:08:02.708 --> 02:08:06.075
Chinese people throw the
money when they pay

02:08:06.167 --> 02:08:07.998
like this... -Why do they do that?

02:08:08.083 --> 02:08:10.415
They consider money to be filthy

02:08:10.500 --> 02:08:12.240
we treasure money

02:08:12.333 --> 02:08:14.198
but they treat it like dirt

02:08:14.292 --> 02:08:16.032
maybe it's because they're so proud

02:08:16.125 --> 02:08:18.491
Chinese people have a strong sense of pride

02:08:18.583 --> 02:08:22.075
they crumple and throw their bills saying,

02:08:22.167 --> 02:08:23.282
"one, two, three, four!"

02:08:23.375 --> 02:08:24.581
They're like, "here! Take it!"

02:08:24.667 --> 02:08:27.079
The Chinese are similar to the Americans

02:08:27.167 --> 02:08:28.268
we're wrong thinking they're more like us

02:08:28.292 --> 02:08:29.873
because of confucius culture

02:08:29.958 --> 02:08:31.018
how come China and America are similar?

02:08:31.042 --> 02:08:32.623
They're both giant continents

02:08:32.708 --> 02:08:33.788
that's true

02:08:33.875 --> 02:08:36.537
they always think the world
revolves around them

02:08:36.625 --> 02:08:38.184
wwhereas we're always
conscious of other people

02:08:38.208 --> 02:08:39.448
just like you

02:08:39.542 --> 02:08:42.739
they're really bold when
they ask for makeup samples

02:08:42.833 --> 02:08:44.915
you know how stores hand
out samples in the streets

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:49.039
but our duty-free store gives them out only
when your purchase reaches a certain amount

02:08:49.125 --> 02:08:53.368
I tell them loud and
clear,"meiyou." "No samples.”

02:08:53.458 --> 02:08:57.246
But they just stand put
and say, "yes! Yes!"

02:08:57.333 --> 02:08:59.619
"You have them! Give them to me!"

02:09:00.250 --> 02:09:03.447
Still, it would like to date a Chinese guy

02:09:03.542 --> 02:09:04.907
please do

02:09:05.583 --> 02:09:08.074
Chinese men are so nice to their women

02:09:08.167 --> 02:09:09.953
they treasure their women

02:09:10.042 --> 02:09:14.411
so a Chinese man treasures his woman

02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:16.957
but throws his cash

02:09:17.042 --> 02:09:18.327
he should throw it at me.

02:09:18.417 --> 02:09:20.123
Better if it's a credit card

02:09:20.208 --> 02:09:22.665
but at the same time, he should treasure me

02:09:44.292 --> 02:09:47.409
Jongsu, why are you leaving?

02:09:48.208 --> 02:09:50.244
You should stay longer

02:09:54.667 --> 02:09:57.500
didn't you want to talk about haemi?

02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:02.536
It seems that I don't need to anymore

02:10:09.083 --> 02:10:11.119
It's no fun being too serious

02:10:11.208 --> 02:10:12.823
know how to enjoy yourself

02:10:14.500 --> 02:10:18.743
you need to feel the hum right here.

02:10:20.667 --> 02:10:23.204
The hum that rocks the core of your soul

02:10:23.917 --> 02:10:25.453
it's the only way to be alive.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.163
This case is a serious offense...

02:11:11.250 --> 02:11:15.118
Wwhereby the defendant
assaulted a public servant.

02:11:15.208 --> 02:11:17.434
The court finds the defendant guilty of
'obstruction of justice, '

02:11:17.458 --> 02:11:20.416
assault', and 'damage of property.'

02:11:20.500 --> 02:11:22.286
the defendant claims this act of violence

02:11:22.375 --> 02:11:24.707
which caused the plaintiff injury...

02:11:24.792 --> 02:11:27.374
Requiring six weeks of medical treatment

02:11:27.458 --> 02:11:31.371
but the defendant swung a
chair, breaking fixtures...

02:11:31.458 --> 02:11:32.789
And injuring the plaintiff.

02:11:32.875 --> 02:11:35.268
Thus, the court is without a doubt in
determining this as an assault.

02:11:35.292 --> 02:11:37.954
Considering that the defendant
is refusing to settle,

02:11:38.042 --> 02:11:41.864
and that the plaintiff wants
the defendant to be punished,

02:11:41.958 --> 02:11:45.746
and that the defendant has been penalized
before for a similar crime,

02:11:45.833 --> 02:11:48.996
the court judges that a corresponding

02:11:49.083 --> 02:11:52.371
and sentences the following order.

02:11:53.208 --> 02:11:58.748
The court rules the defendant 1 year
and 6 months of imprisonment.

02:12:00.667 --> 02:12:03.033
Court is adjourned

02:12:20.042 --> 02:12:26.083
Come on! Climb up

02:12:30.167 --> 02:12:32.783
let's go! Climb up! Go

02:12:32.875 --> 02:12:35.582
good girl

02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:46.036
So long

02:12:52.875 --> 02:12:54.285
She's saying something

02:18:40.916 --> 02:18:42.123
Hey jongsu

02:18:42.333 --> 02:18:44.574
I see there are a lot of greenhouses here

02:18:46.666 --> 02:18:48.076
where's haemi?

02:18:49.750 --> 02:18:51.536
You asked me to join you and haemi

02:18:52.916 --> 02:18:54.498
isn't she with you?

02:25:07.958 --> 02:25:12.156
