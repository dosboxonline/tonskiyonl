<i>Central Services</i>

01:08.189 --> 01:11.024
<i>We do the work, you do the pleasure</i>

01:11.150 --> 01:14.277
<i>Hi, there. I want to talk to you about ducts.</i>

01:15.154 --> 01:17.822
<i>Do your ducts seem old-fashioned,</i>

01:18.241 --> 01:19.741
<i>out-of-date?</i>

01:19.992 --> 01:22.953
<i>Central Services' new duct designs</i>

01:23.037 --> 01:26.373
<i>are now available</i>
<i>in hundreds of different colors</i>

01:26.457 --> 01:28.833
<i>to suit your individual taste.</i>

01:29.293 --> 01:34.297
<i>Hurry now, while stocks last, to your</i>
<i>nearest Central Services showroom.</i>

01:35.299 --> 01:39.094
<i>Designer colors</i>
<i>to suit your demanding taste.</i>

01:59.824 --> 02:02.534
<i>We have with us</i>
<i>from the Ministry of Information</i>

02:02.618 --> 02:05.412
<i>Deputy Minister, Eugene Helpmann.</i>

02:05.621 --> 02:07.497
<i>Good evening, David.</i>

02:07.832 --> 02:12.002
<i>What do you believe is behind</i>
<i>this recent increase in terrorist bombings?</i>

02:12.211 --> 02:14.004
<i>Bad sportsmanship.</i>

02:14.380 --> 02:16.506
<i>A ruthless minority of people</i>

02:16.590 --> 02:20.468
<i>seems to have forgotten</i>
<i>certain good old-fashioned virtues.</i>

02:20.803 --> 02:24.180
<i>They just can't stand seeing</i>
<i>the other fellow win.</i>

02:24.307 --> 02:26.808
<i>If these people would just play the game</i>

02:27.059 --> 02:28.893
<i>they'd get a lot more out of life.</i>

02:28.978 --> 02:31.896
<i>Nevertheless, Mr. Helpmann,</i>
<i>there are those who maintain</i>

02:31.981 --> 02:35.692
<i>that the Ministry of Information</i>
<i>has become too large and unwieldy.</i>

02:35.776 --> 02:38.486
<i>In free society,</i>
<i>information is the name of the game.</i>

02:38.571 --> 02:41.323
<i>You can't win the game</i>
<i>if you're a man short.</i>

02:41.407 --> 02:45.869
<i>The cost of it all, seven percent</i>
<i>of the gross national product.</i>

02:45.953 --> 02:49.414
<i>I understand this concern</i>
<i>on behalf of the taxpayers.</i>

02:49.498 --> 02:52.876
<i>People want value for money.</i>
<i>That is why we always insist</i>

02:52.960 --> 02:56.504
<i>on the principle</i>
<i>of Information Retrieval Charges.</i>

02:57.840 --> 02:59.758
<i>It's absolutely right and fair</i>

02:59.842 --> 03:03.261
<i>that those found guilty</i>
<i>should pay for their periods of detention</i>

03:03.804 --> 03:08.224
<i>and for the information retrieval</i>
<i>procedures used in their interrogation.</i>

03:08.642 --> 03:11.895
<i>Do you believe that the government</i>
<i>is winning against terrorists?</i>

03:11.979 --> 03:13.313
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

03:15.733 --> 03:18.818
<i>We're fielding all their strokes,</i>
<i>running all of them out</i>

03:18.903 --> 03:21.780
<i>and pretty consistently</i>
<i>knocking them for six.</i>

03:24.575 --> 03:26.493
<i>I'd say they're nearly out of the game.</i>

03:38.464 --> 03:42.050
<i>Mr. Helpmann, the bombing campaign</i>
<i>is now in its 13th year.</i>

03:42.760 --> 03:44.469
<i>Beginner's luck.</i>

03:45.721 --> 03:47.597
<i>Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.</i>

03:48.099 --> 03:52.227
<i>Thank you, David.</i>
<i>And a very merry Christmas to you all.</i>

03:54.897 --> 03:57.190
"Scrooge was better than his word.

03:57.274 --> 04:00.235
"He did it all, and infinitely more.

04:00.486 --> 04:03.530
"And to Tiny Tim, who did not die

04:03.906 --> 04:06.491
"he became a second father.

04:06.742 --> 04:10.787
"He became as good a friend,
in the good old world.

04:11.497 --> 04:14.124
"And so, as Tiny Tim observed

04:14.667 --> 04:17.334
"God bless us, everyone."

04:22.048 --> 04:23.800
<i>Are you boys giving me the runaround?</i>

04:23.884 --> 04:26.845
<i>Now, I have to say, "Hey, hey."</i>

04:27.263 --> 04:29.848
<i>Don't throw that.</i>
<i>That's only for long distance.</i>

04:31.267 --> 04:33.852
<i>- I'm sorry, we haven't got any vacancies.</i>
<i>- No vacancies?</i>

04:33.936 --> 04:35.353
<i>We've got plenty of rooms.</i>

04:47.616 --> 04:49.117
Who's there?

04:52.246 --> 04:53.746
Who is that?

04:54.582 --> 04:58.376
Father Christmas can't come
if we haven't got a chimney.

04:58.461 --> 04:59.919
You'll see.

05:49.762 --> 05:52.347
"I hereby inform you,
under powers entrusted to me

05:52.431 --> 05:56.434

Sign here, please.

06:16.205 --> 06:18.331
Where are you taking him?

06:18.958 --> 06:20.208
There.

06:22.127 --> 06:23.503
Thank you.

06:23.963 --> 06:25.463
Same again, please.

06:26.549 --> 06:28.883
Press harder this time. Good.

06:29.718 --> 06:31.553
What is this all about?

06:32.304 --> 06:35.265
That is your receipt for your husband.
Thank you.

06:35.349 --> 06:37.976
This is my receipt for your receipt.

06:38.060 --> 06:39.811
Mrs. Buttle, are you okay?

06:43.857 --> 06:47.318
We're Department of Works!
Department of Works up here.

06:48.153 --> 06:51.072
- Careful with those bloody things.
- Sure.

06:51.699 --> 06:53.575
Don't take any notice of them.

06:53.659 --> 06:56.077
Don't touch me!
Why don't you just get out of here.

06:56.161 --> 06:59.163
Don't you worry.
We'll have everything shipshape in a jiffy.

06:59.623 --> 07:00.832
Nothing to worry about.

07:00.916 --> 07:03.501
It's Tuttle downstairs who can worry.

07:03.836 --> 07:06.838
Tuttle? His name's Buttle.
There must be some mistake.

07:07.172 --> 07:10.049
Mistake? We don't make mistakes.

07:13.012 --> 07:17.056
Bloody typical. They've gone back
to metric without telling us.

07:17.182 --> 07:19.517
Mrs. Buttle, are you all right?

07:19.602 --> 07:20.893
Yes...

08:51.944 --> 08:53.111
Buttle.

08:56.281 --> 08:58.449
Buttle, Archibald.

09:07.292 --> 09:08.626
Oh, shit!

09:10.879 --> 09:12.296
Mister...

09:14.967 --> 09:17.885
Mr. Lowry, would you step in here, please.

09:54.339 --> 09:56.340
Has anybody seen Lowry?

09:59.344 --> 10:02.138
Has anybody seen

10:02.222 --> 10:04.140
Sam Lowry?

10:40.219 --> 10:41.385
Sam.

11:18.465 --> 11:20.341
<i>Hello? Sam. Where are you?</i>

11:20.425 --> 11:21.676
- Hello?
<i>- It's 11:00.</i>

11:22.678 --> 11:24.679
- What?
<i>- It's 11:00.</i>

11:24.930 --> 11:26.514
Mr. Kurtzmann.

11:28.308 --> 11:29.934
You're up late.

11:30.686 --> 11:32.019
Is it?

11:37.526 --> 11:40.820
- The electrics here are up the spout.
<i>- Yeah, I know.</i>

11:40.946 --> 11:42.446
- Yours, too?
- Yes.

11:43.949 --> 11:46.993
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Yes, thanks. 'Bye.

12:49.389 --> 12:51.515
This is not the only statue.

12:52.976 --> 12:55.102
What's this gun for?

12:55.187 --> 12:58.773
This one, Sister,
is a nine millimeter submachine gun

12:58.857 --> 13:02.485
used for close-quarter combat fighting.
Very effective weapon.

13:02.569 --> 13:03.569
Would you like to see it?

13:34.309 --> 13:35.476
Sam!

13:37.270 --> 13:38.479
Jack!

13:40.816 --> 13:42.566
Long time no see.

13:44.069 --> 13:45.361
What are you doing here?

13:45.445 --> 13:47.947
Didn't expect to see you
slumming it in Records.

13:48.073 --> 13:50.157
- What's the problem?
- Problem? No problem.

13:50.242 --> 13:51.826
Everything's fine. Marvelous.

13:52.160 --> 13:55.413
Alison's in great shape, kids are fine.
I'm on Security Level 5

13:55.497 --> 13:58.708
so Mr. Helpmann relies on me
more and more. It's been a great year.

13:59.251 --> 14:00.418
You sound worried.

14:00.627 --> 14:03.504
Worried? Me?
If I'm worried about anyone, Sam, it's you.

14:05.507 --> 14:06.924
Sam, whatever happened to you?

14:07.426 --> 14:08.759
Records.

14:21.023 --> 14:22.273
Sam?

14:24.818 --> 14:28.195
Jack, it's great to see you.
I'm going to be late.

14:28.447 --> 14:31.657
Sam, let a friend tell you
your life is going wrong.

14:31.783 --> 14:35.077
Records is a dead-end department.
No security that's worth a damn.

14:35.162 --> 14:38.497
- It's impossible to get noticed.
- I know. Wonderful.

14:38.623 --> 14:40.958
Marvelous. Perfect.

14:41.043 --> 14:44.253
See you, Jack.
Give my regards to Alison and the twins.

14:44.337 --> 14:46.213
- Triplets.
- Triplets?

14:46.423 --> 14:49.091
God, how time flies.

14:50.802 --> 14:54.638
A very clear delineation of picture, is it not?
Mobile.

14:55.140 --> 14:56.307
Next!

15:01.146 --> 15:03.814
I want to report a wrongful arrest.

15:04.191 --> 15:07.276
You want Information Adjustments.
Different department.

15:07.360 --> 15:10.404
I've been to Information Adjustments.
They sent me here.

15:10.489 --> 15:12.531
They said you have a form I need to fill out.

15:13.241 --> 15:16.035
- Have you got an arrest receipt?
- Yeah.

15:17.829 --> 15:19.163
Is it stamped?

15:19.998 --> 15:21.332
Stamped?

15:23.335 --> 15:26.003
No, there's no stamp on it, you see.

15:26.630 --> 15:29.840
I can't let you have the form
until this is stamped.

15:29.966 --> 15:31.217
Where do I get it stamped?

15:31.760 --> 15:33.844
Information Adjustments.

15:46.733 --> 15:47.858
It's nothing.

15:51.071 --> 15:54.490
It keeps picking up old films.
That can't be right, can it?

15:55.033 --> 15:57.284
Perhaps the machine's on the blink.

15:57.369 --> 15:58.410
No, it's not the machine.

15:58.495 --> 16:00.788
There's a mismatch
on the personnel code numbers.

16:01.206 --> 16:05.709
Tuttle should've had £31.06
debited against his account, not Buttle.

16:05.836 --> 16:08.712
- My God, a mistake!
- At least it's not ours.

16:09.047 --> 16:11.006
Isn't it? Whose is it?

16:11.091 --> 16:13.592
- Information Retrieval.
- Good.

16:13.718 --> 16:16.971
Expediting has put in
for electrical procedures in respect of

16:17.055 --> 16:19.849
Buttle, Archibald, shoe-repair operative.

16:19.933 --> 16:24.103
But Security has invoiced Admin.
for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer.

16:24.271 --> 16:27.231
What a relief. Well, finish your tea, Sam.

16:28.441 --> 16:29.733
Thanks.

16:30.902 --> 16:33.821
I don't know what I'd do
if you ever got promoted.

16:33.905 --> 16:37.950
- God, don't worry about that.
- But if they did promote you.

16:39.369 --> 16:42.037
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.

16:42.122 --> 16:44.373
- Would you, really?
- Really.

16:45.584 --> 16:46.584
You've been promoted.

16:51.256 --> 16:54.592
It's your mother, isn't it?
Pulling strings again.

16:59.097 --> 17:03.100
Sam, it's time for you to grow up
and accept responsibility.

17:03.268 --> 17:07.271
Your poor father would be appalled
at your lack of promotion.

17:08.106 --> 17:11.317
Mother, I just wish
you would stop interfering.

17:11.776 --> 17:15.029
I don't want promotion.
I'm happy where I am.

17:15.113 --> 17:18.449
No, you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you.

17:18.575 --> 17:21.702
He doesn't have your brains,
but he's got the ambition.

17:21.786 --> 17:26.665
You haven't got the ambition. Luckily,
you've got me and the Deputy Minister.

17:26.790 --> 17:28.792
Mr. Helpmann was very close
to your father.

17:28.877 --> 17:32.087
Now please, Mrs. Lowry. Don't get upset.

17:32.172 --> 17:35.216
Mr. Lowry, please wait in the reception.
You're giving her wrinkles.

17:35.300 --> 17:37.051
- You see?
- God!

17:37.135 --> 17:39.261
Just try and relax, Mrs. Lowry.

17:39.846 --> 17:41.680
I'll make you 20 years younger.

17:42.474 --> 17:45.017
Dr. Jaffe, you are a genius.

17:45.143 --> 17:47.561
Would you like to be Surgeon General?

17:47.646 --> 17:50.356
I know simply everybody.

17:50.482 --> 17:53.776
They won't know you
when I've finished with you.

17:55.028 --> 17:56.362
First,

17:56.613 --> 17:58.822
we remove the excess derma.

18:01.785 --> 18:05.663
Now the flaccid tissues under the eyes
and forehead.

18:09.834 --> 18:12.378
Now, I lift

18:13.338 --> 18:15.756
the wrinkles and the worry lines

18:15.840 --> 18:18.842
right up into the wig, into the hairline.

18:21.346 --> 18:22.972
Now the template.

18:24.891 --> 18:28.269
Now, a bit of sticky. Comme ça!

18:28.687 --> 18:32.064
Already she's twice as beautiful
as she was before.

18:32.148 --> 18:33.148
<i>Voilà!</i>

18:34.985 --> 18:37.695
Mr. Helpmann
was very close to your poor father.

18:37.821 --> 18:41.156
He was close to me. He still is.

18:43.034 --> 18:47.204
He'll take you under his wing
when you get to Information Retrieval.

18:47.330 --> 18:49.206
You'll like it there.

18:49.374 --> 18:51.625
You're not listening to me, Mother.

18:56.214 --> 18:58.048
What the hell is this, lady?

18:58.174 --> 19:01.051
It's a present for my son. Really!

19:01.886 --> 19:04.847
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.

19:06.933 --> 19:08.559
What on Earth is it?

19:08.685 --> 19:11.562
Something for an executive.

19:15.066 --> 19:19.111
Madam Lowry! You look exquisite today.
Merry Christmas.

19:19.237 --> 19:21.572
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.

19:22.198 --> 19:25.034
- You remember my son, Samuel?
- Of course.

19:25.118 --> 19:26.952
We're joining Mrs. Terrain.

19:27.078 --> 19:28.787
Yes, they're waiting.

19:35.795 --> 19:39.256
- Mother, I thought we'd be able to talk.
- We will.

19:39.382 --> 19:42.885
- Ida!
- God. She's got what's-her-name with her.

19:45.096 --> 19:47.890
Well, Alma, how are you?

19:47.974 --> 19:50.142
You look wonderful.

19:50.435 --> 19:52.311
Hello, Shirley.

19:52.937 --> 19:54.646
Thank you, Spiro.

19:55.565 --> 19:57.149
- Salt?
- Not yet.

19:57.776 --> 20:00.444
Sam, Happy Christmas.

20:02.489 --> 20:04.823
- So sorry we're late.
- Thanks.

20:04.949 --> 20:06.784
Now, Alma

20:07.243 --> 20:08.869
what are you going to have?

20:08.953 --> 20:12.539
I can't make up my mind whether to have
the number one or the number two.

20:12.624 --> 20:14.291
What do you recommend, Spiro?

20:14.417 --> 20:16.502
Between you and me, madame,

20:16.628 --> 20:19.421
- today the number two.
- Thank you, Spiro.

20:19.506 --> 20:21.673
Shirley, what are you going to have?

20:21.800 --> 20:25.844
Between you and me, mademoiselle,
today the number one.

20:26.179 --> 20:27.763
Madam Lowry?

20:28.014 --> 20:32.267
To hell with the diet!
I'm going to have a number eight, please.

20:32.352 --> 20:35.437
- A most perceptive choice, if I may say so.
- Oh, Ida.

20:35.522 --> 20:37.689
<i>- Monsieur?</i>
- Steak, please, rare. Mother...

20:37.816 --> 20:40.442
<i>- Monsieur, quel numéro?</i>
- I don't know which number.

20:40.527 --> 20:42.653
- Mother, please...
- That one. There.

20:42.779 --> 20:44.238
Thanks. Mother, will you...

20:44.322 --> 20:48.409
Alma! You wicked girl.
You've started your treatments.

20:48.493 --> 20:51.161
- Say the number, please.
- You noticed.

20:51.329 --> 20:53.664
- You have to say the number!
- Go away!

20:53.790 --> 20:55.624
I must tell you all about it.

20:55.708 --> 20:57.292
Number three.

20:59.504 --> 21:03.298
- Mother, will you listen to me?
<i>- Numéro huit.</i>

21:04.467 --> 21:08.554
Braised veal in wine sauce.

21:11.057 --> 21:15.811
It's too exciting.
I've left Dr. Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.

21:15.895 --> 21:18.188
<i>Numéro deux, duck à I'orange.</i>

21:18.314 --> 21:20.441
- Chapman?
<i>- Excusez-moi.</i>

21:20.525 --> 21:22.818
The acid man?

21:23.069 --> 21:26.655
Really, Ida. Just because
his techniques are revolutionary.

21:26.739 --> 21:29.867
I don't go around calling
Dr. Jaffe "the knife man."

21:29.993 --> 21:32.703
<i>Numéro un, crevettes à la mayonnaise.</i>

21:32.829 --> 21:34.455
I am sorry, Alma.

21:34.539 --> 21:37.458
- I didn't mean to...
- It's all right, Ida.

21:37.542 --> 21:40.252
<i>Steak. Numéro trois!</i>

21:42.547 --> 21:44.381
<i>Mesdames, monsieur</i>

21:45.091 --> 21:47.259
<i>bon appétit!</i>

21:47.385 --> 21:49.178
<i>- Merci!</i>
<i>- Merci!</i>

21:49.262 --> 21:53.974
Acid, on the other hand, can be used
for such wonderfully subtle shading

21:54.058 --> 21:56.143
such delicate nuances.

21:56.227 --> 21:59.646
Like a Rembrandt etching.
And it is so much quicker.

21:59.731 --> 22:03.692
If it wasn't for this complication,
it could've happened to anybody,

22:03.776 --> 22:06.904
I'd have had this dressing off yesterday.

22:07.697 --> 22:08.947
Shirley.

22:10.074 --> 22:11.074
Salt?

22:34.891 --> 22:36.225
What were we saying?

22:36.309 --> 22:38.227
God, this isn't rare.

22:38.645 --> 22:43.607
By the by, I saw the most wonderful idea
for Christmas presents at the chemist's.

22:43.733 --> 22:46.235
Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.

22:46.319 --> 22:48.237
That sounds marvelous!

22:48.321 --> 22:52.074
It's good at any doctor's
and most of the major hospitals.

22:52.158 --> 22:55.869
It's also accepted
for gynecological examinations

22:55.954 --> 22:58.288
including Caesarian sections.

22:58.665 --> 23:00.832
- Spiro.
- Madam, I don't know what to say.

23:00.959 --> 23:05.128
This never happens to us. I'm going
to do something about it straightaway.

23:05.964 --> 23:09.299
Sam, can't you do something
about these terrorists?

23:09.759 --> 23:11.510
It's my lunch hour.

23:12.804 --> 23:14.638
Besides, it's not my department.

23:14.764 --> 23:19.518
Actually, Alma, that's one of
the little things I've been dying to tell you.

23:19.978 --> 23:23.939
Sam's being promoted
to Information Retrieval.

23:24.023 --> 23:28.110
Why, that's wonderful!
Congratulations, Sam.

23:28.319 --> 23:32.864
Stop it! I'm not being promoted.
I'm not going to Information Retrieval.

23:32.991 --> 23:35.993
If I wanted to upset you, Mother,
I'd tell you where to stick it.

23:40.123 --> 23:41.373
Pepper?

23:43.626 --> 23:44.626
I've got to go.

23:45.503 --> 23:47.588
You haven't had your dessert.

23:47.672 --> 23:50.382
I don't want dessert,
promotion or anything!

23:50.508 --> 23:54.845
Of course you want something.
You must have hopes, wishes, dreams?

23:55.054 --> 23:57.222
No, nothing. Not even dreams.

24:08.359 --> 24:09.526
Sam.

24:42.310 --> 24:43.477
Sam!

25:24.560 --> 25:25.894
Oh, God!

25:48.960 --> 25:51.294
Hello. Central Services?

25:51.713 --> 25:54.548
I'm at 579B, Block 19,
Northwestern Section D.

25:54.632 --> 25:57.884
Exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway
at the Orange Blossom Flyover.

25:57.969 --> 26:01.221
I've got trouble with my air conditioning.
It's an emergency.

26:01.305 --> 26:05.308
<i>Thank you for calling Central Services.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, due to staff shortages</i>

26:05.435 --> 26:09.813
<i>Central Services cannot take service calls</i>
<i>between 2300 and 0900 hours.</i>

26:09.939 --> 26:12.315
<i>Have a nice day.</i>
<i>This has not been a recording.</i>

26:12.400 --> 26:14.067
This is an emergency!

26:14.152 --> 26:18.822
<i>- Thank you for calling Central Services.</i>
- Look, I've got to have a heating engineer.

26:18.948 --> 26:21.825
<i>- Thank you for calling Central Services.</i>
- Oh, shit!

26:46.601 --> 26:47.851
Hello.

26:57.528 --> 26:59.321
- Hello.
<i>- Hello.</i>

27:09.040 --> 27:10.791
<i>Hello, Mr. Lowry.</i>

27:10.875 --> 27:12.626
Yes, who is this?

27:13.211 --> 27:16.213
<i>Put the phone down and raise your hands.</i>

27:16.631 --> 27:18.381
What? Who is this?

27:22.053 --> 27:23.887
Nice and easy, now.

27:29.977 --> 27:32.896
Just keep your hands where I can see them.

27:58.339 --> 27:59.923
What are you doing?

28:04.220 --> 28:07.514
Harry Tuttle, heating engineer,
at your service.

28:11.269 --> 28:12.561
Tuttle?

28:14.355 --> 28:15.897
Are you from Central Services?

28:22.113 --> 28:23.780
I called Central Services.

28:23.906 --> 28:25.282
They're overworked these days.

28:25.867 --> 28:28.410
Luckily, I intercepted your call.

28:29.287 --> 28:30.745
You did...

28:32.290 --> 28:35.292
Just a minute.
What was that business with the gun?

28:36.085 --> 28:38.086
Just a precaution, sir.

28:39.714 --> 28:42.465
I've had traps set for me before now.

28:42.925 --> 28:47.888
Plenty of people in Central Services would
love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.

28:49.765 --> 28:51.766
Are you telling me that this is illegal?

28:58.566 --> 28:59.858
Well, yes and no.

28:59.942 --> 29:02.485
Officially, only Central Services
can touch this stuff.

29:02.570 --> 29:04.070
Would you hold this, please?

29:04.155 --> 29:06.907
But nowadays,
with all the new rules and regulations

29:06.991 --> 29:08.992
they can't get decent staff anymore.

29:09.076 --> 29:11.661
They turn a blind eye as long as I'm careful.

29:11.787 --> 29:15.165
But if they could prove that I've been
working on their equipment

29:15.291 --> 29:17.500
that's a plate of a different color.

29:17.585 --> 29:20.253
- Wouldn't it be simpler just to...
- Hold this, please.

29:20.338 --> 29:21.671
Sorry, yes.

29:21.797 --> 29:25.258
I was saying, wouldn't it be simpler
to work with Central Services?

29:25.343 --> 29:27.302
I couldn't stand the...

29:28.763 --> 29:31.181
- It's getting warm.
- You couldn't stand the what?

29:31.307 --> 29:33.183
I couldn't stand the paperwork.

29:33.267 --> 29:34.684
Listen,

29:34.769 --> 29:38.104
this system of yours could be on fire,
and I couldn't turn on a kitchen tap

29:38.189 --> 29:40.899
without filling out a 27B/6.

29:41.359 --> 29:43.109
Bloody paperwork.

29:43.694 --> 29:46.029
I suppose one has to expect
a certain amount.

29:46.197 --> 29:48.949
Why? I came into this
for the action, the excitement.

29:49.033 --> 29:53.536
Go anywhere, travel light. Get in, get out,
wherever there's trouble. A man alone.

29:54.872 --> 29:56.247
They've got the whole country
sectioned off.

29:56.332 --> 29:58.291
Can't make a move without a form.

30:15.184 --> 30:17.560
Found it. There's your problem.

30:17.853 --> 30:19.813
- Can you fix it?
- No, I can't.

30:19.897 --> 30:23.566
But I can bypass it with one of these.

30:26.028 --> 30:27.487
Fine by me.

30:32.410 --> 30:34.244
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

30:39.917 --> 30:41.668
Wait here. Wait.

30:48.342 --> 30:50.760
The flashlight.

30:53.931 --> 30:55.849
- Central Services.
- Central Services.

30:55.933 --> 30:58.935
- Yes.
- You rang, sir.

30:59.061 --> 31:01.604
Trouble with your air conditioning?

31:01.772 --> 31:03.273
No, it's all right.

31:06.277 --> 31:07.360
It's fixed.

31:07.778 --> 31:09.112
It's fixed?

31:09.530 --> 31:13.241
Yes. I mean, it fixed itself.

31:13.534 --> 31:15.201
Fixed itself, did it?

31:16.245 --> 31:17.370
Yes.

31:19.123 --> 31:21.458
Machines don't fix themselves.

31:22.460 --> 31:24.627
He's tampered with it.

31:26.297 --> 31:28.715
Sorry you had a wasted journey.

31:30.092 --> 31:32.552
I think we ought to have a look.

31:35.431 --> 31:37.390
Have you got a 27B/6?

31:37.475 --> 31:38.808
A 27B/6?

31:46.984 --> 31:48.485
Now look what you've done to him.

31:50.738 --> 31:52.655
Have you got a 27B/6?

31:53.074 --> 31:55.075
Not as such.

31:57.119 --> 31:58.912
But we'll get one.

32:00.331 --> 32:02.248
It's all right, it's all right.

32:02.792 --> 32:05.835
Sorry. I'm a bit of a stickler for paperwork.

32:05.920 --> 32:08.838
Where would we be
if we didn't stick to the correct procedures?

32:08.923 --> 32:10.507
We'll be back.

32:11.509 --> 32:13.051
We'll be back!

32:18.516 --> 32:19.766
Thanks for coming.

32:19.850 --> 32:22.143
We'll be back, you clever bastard!

32:22.520 --> 32:24.938
- Thank you.
- We'll show you.

32:32.363 --> 32:35.865
Thanks, Lowry.
You're a good man in a tight corner.

32:45.042 --> 32:47.627
I just happen to work
at the Ministry of Information.

32:47.711 --> 32:48.711
What?

32:50.381 --> 32:52.715
I just happen to know that

32:53.217 --> 32:57.220
Information Retrieval
are looking for an Archibald Tuttle,

32:57.304 --> 32:59.055
heating engineer.

33:01.809 --> 33:04.561
You wouldn't by any chance... Would you?

33:07.022 --> 33:09.399
My good friends call me Harry.

33:11.235 --> 33:13.194
Information Retrieval?

33:13.904 --> 33:15.405
The big boys.

33:20.911 --> 33:23.121
What do they want you for?

33:28.169 --> 33:29.627
Time to go.

33:30.254 --> 33:31.713
How's that?

33:37.219 --> 33:40.013
You really must let me give you something.

33:44.059 --> 33:46.603
How much will it be for the work?

33:48.439 --> 33:52.108
Come on. You did me a favor.
Just check the corridor.

33:55.404 --> 33:56.654
Thanks.

33:56.739 --> 33:59.574
Listen, kid. We're all in this together.

33:59.742 --> 34:00.992
Go on.

34:15.216 --> 34:16.341
AII clear.

34:45.329 --> 34:47.830
I think Kurtzmann is getting suspicious.

34:51.126 --> 34:53.043
What's playing today?

34:53.712 --> 34:55.170
<i>Casablanca.</i>

34:55.255 --> 34:57.715
<i>Mr. Lowry, step in here, please.</i>

35:01.595 --> 35:02.845
<i>Lowry!</i>

35:04.682 --> 35:06.683
<i>Now, Mr. Lowry!</i>

35:19.488 --> 35:22.740
Thank God you're here.
We're in terrible trouble.

35:30.833 --> 35:32.166
Look at this.

35:32.251 --> 35:35.253
- It's a check.
- It's the refund for Tuttle.

35:35.337 --> 35:36.629
Tuttle?

35:38.132 --> 35:40.091
Buttle. I mean Buttle.

35:40.467 --> 35:42.593
It's been confusion from the word go.

35:42.678 --> 35:45.596
He was overcharged
for Information Retrieval procedures.

35:45.681 --> 35:48.599
And someone, somewhere,
is trying to make us carry the can.

35:48.684 --> 35:52.312
Can I have a look?
I've never seen a refund check before.

35:52.396 --> 35:54.439
I'll bet it's Jeffries.

35:56.358 --> 35:57.525
Yes.

35:57.735 --> 36:00.903
He believes that people
should pay more for their interrogation.

36:00.988 --> 36:03.031
And B: he loathes me.

36:03.198 --> 36:04.949
We've got to get rid of it.

36:05.034 --> 36:08.286
Send it to somebody else.
Better still, send it to Buttle.

36:08.370 --> 36:09.954
After all, it's his check.

36:10.039 --> 36:12.373
I've tried that. Look at this.

36:12.624 --> 36:13.666
You see?

36:13.751 --> 36:16.919
The population census
has got him down as dormanted.

36:17.004 --> 36:20.590
The Central Collective Storehouse
computer has got him down as deleted.

36:20.674 --> 36:21.674
Hang on.

36:21.759 --> 36:24.135
Information Retrieval's
got him inoperative.

36:24.219 --> 36:26.888
Security has got him down as excised.

36:26.972 --> 36:29.724
- Administration's got him as completed.
- He's dead.

36:32.144 --> 36:33.311
Dead?

36:35.773 --> 36:37.690
Well, that's awful.

36:42.112 --> 36:45.073
We'll never get rid of the damn thing now.

36:45.783 --> 36:47.742
What are we going to do, Sam?

36:48.410 --> 36:49.952
Could try the next of kin.

36:57.961 --> 37:00.546
There we go. "Buttle, Veronica, Mrs."

37:00.631 --> 37:02.006
Veronica?

37:02.966 --> 37:05.259
What's the number on the check?

37:05.344 --> 37:08.638
27156789

37:10.766 --> 37:14.268
/074328K.

37:17.272 --> 37:19.065
Right into memory.

37:20.776 --> 37:22.443
Central Banking.

37:23.821 --> 37:25.613
Veronica Buttle

37:26.407 --> 37:27.573
Mrs.

37:28.700 --> 37:30.034
Deposit.

37:45.134 --> 37:46.926
Thank God for that.

37:47.177 --> 37:48.928
Would you like some tea?

37:59.189 --> 38:00.857
There's a problem.

38:00.941 --> 38:03.401
She doesn't have a bank account.

38:07.406 --> 38:09.323
Well, that's it then.

38:10.534 --> 38:13.578
I might just as well
go and hang myself now.

38:16.290 --> 38:20.835
This could never have happened
before the stupid 7th tier reorganization.

38:20.919 --> 38:22.545
That's Simmons' doing.

38:22.629 --> 38:25.047
He and Jeffries
always sit together at lunch.

38:25.132 --> 38:26.466
Bastards!

38:32.806 --> 38:36.934
Perhaps we could lose the thing
behind a filing cabinet or something

38:37.019 --> 38:40.480
- or burn it, eat it...
- Look. There is one solution.

38:40.564 --> 38:42.607
- What?
- Drive out to Mrs. Buttle

38:42.691 --> 38:46.152
Iet her sign at the back of the check.
She can cash it at the corner sweet shop.

38:48.280 --> 38:50.198
That's brilliant, Sam.

38:50.282 --> 38:51.866
I'll even do it for you.

38:51.950 --> 38:54.285
Here, authorize the check.
What's the address?

38:54.369 --> 38:56.287
Everything's in here.

38:59.791 --> 39:01.083
What shall I do next?

39:03.670 --> 39:05.087
Pink and blue receipts.

39:05.172 --> 39:08.799
Sign there, there and there.
And sign the check there.

39:14.598 --> 39:16.807
I think I've broken a bone.

39:17.142 --> 39:20.978
My wrist is all limp.
What a pathetic creature I am!

39:23.982 --> 39:25.816
I'll do it for you.

39:44.711 --> 39:46.837
Right. I'll be on my way.

39:49.716 --> 39:50.883
Sam?

39:54.304 --> 39:55.972
You are good to me, you know.

39:56.932 --> 40:00.017
<i>- Here's looking at you, kid.</i>
- Here's looking at you.

40:18.495 --> 40:21.539
<i>We interrupt this program</i>
<i>to bring you news of a terrorist bombing</i>

40:21.623 --> 40:23.165
<i>at the Blue Lagoon...</i>

41:04.166 --> 41:06.125
Hello. I wonder if you could tell me where...

41:06.209 --> 41:07.918
Piss off!

41:12.716 --> 41:13.966
Hello.

41:15.719 --> 41:17.553
I'll never confess!

41:23.518 --> 41:26.145
Come on, you've got to interrogate me.

41:52.297 --> 41:53.798
Mrs. Buttle?

41:58.261 --> 41:59.762
Mrs. Buttle?

42:08.689 --> 42:10.523
Are you Mrs. Buttle?

42:17.781 --> 42:19.532
My name is Lowry.

42:21.284 --> 42:22.702
Sam Lowry.

42:25.539 --> 42:28.249
I'm from the Ministry of Information.

42:31.253 --> 42:33.629
I've come to give you a check.

42:38.885 --> 42:42.012
It's a refund, actually. There was a mistake.

42:42.597 --> 42:43.931
Mistake?

42:44.015 --> 42:47.518
Yes. Not my department, of course.
I'm only Records.

42:49.646 --> 42:54.608
I'll tell you what it is. It seems Mr. Buttle
was overcharged by Information Retrieval.

42:55.485 --> 42:58.446
They don't usually make mistakes

42:59.114 --> 43:01.282
but I suppose we're all human.

43:05.996 --> 43:08.080
What happened to the...

43:12.502 --> 43:15.337
Actually, my coming here
is rather unorthodox.

43:15.422 --> 43:20.176
Bringing you this check. Any payments are
normally made through Central Computer

43:20.343 --> 43:22.636
but as there were certain

43:23.305 --> 43:26.807
difficulties, we thought,
rather than cause delay

43:27.392 --> 43:29.518
we'd let you have it now.

43:29.811 --> 43:32.104
It being Christmas and all.

43:33.106 --> 43:35.399
My husband's dead, isn't he?

43:38.111 --> 43:41.572
I do assure you, Mrs. Buttle,
the Ministry is very scrupulous

43:41.656 --> 43:44.450
about following up
and eradicating any error.

43:44.534 --> 43:47.244
But if you do have any complaints
you wish to make,

43:47.329 --> 43:51.457
I'd be only too happy
to send you the appropriate forms.

43:51.792 --> 43:54.335
What have you done with his body?

44:01.301 --> 44:04.762
I don't know anything about that.
I'm really just

44:04.846 --> 44:07.056
delivering the check. So if...

44:07.140 --> 44:11.143
Look, if you wouldn't mind
just signing these two receipts,

44:11.853 --> 44:15.856
I'd be only too happy to leave you in peace.

44:16.024 --> 44:18.108
He hadn't done anything.

44:18.527 --> 44:20.027
He was good!

44:21.655 --> 44:26.116
What have you done with his body?

44:33.291 --> 44:35.918
It isn't being very helpful, is it?

44:43.426 --> 44:46.762
I didn't have to come here,
you know, Mrs. Buttle.

44:48.098 --> 44:50.266
I'll kill you, you bastard!

44:52.143 --> 44:53.477
Stop it!

45:04.239 --> 45:06.031
Are you all right?

45:07.409 --> 45:09.201
Are you all right?

45:14.082 --> 45:16.000
Mrs. Buttle, are you all right?

45:16.084 --> 45:17.209
It's you.

45:18.211 --> 45:20.129
Wait, stop! Don't go!

46:32.911 --> 46:36.538
Stop! I had nothing to do with it. Wait!

46:36.623 --> 46:37.831
Stop!

47:01.064 --> 47:03.357
- Go away.
- Her name's Jill.

47:04.234 --> 47:05.401
What?

47:05.819 --> 47:06.986
Jill?

47:07.404 --> 47:08.737
Jill who?

47:09.239 --> 47:10.280
Jill who?

47:11.616 --> 47:12.741
Layton.

47:15.036 --> 47:16.495
Jill Layton.

47:17.706 --> 47:19.999
You're a very good little girl.

47:20.083 --> 47:23.085
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for my daddy.

47:23.253 --> 47:25.963
He will be pleased when he gets home.

48:11.426 --> 48:14.720
Sam, I've just had
the transport pool onto me.

48:14.804 --> 48:18.223
You don't know anything about a personnel
transporter gone missing, do you?

48:18.308 --> 48:20.017
Personnel transporter?

48:20.435 --> 48:21.435
What?

48:22.062 --> 48:24.855
The pranets, I had a personal transporter.

48:24.939 --> 48:27.316
I'll do the paperwork in the morning.

48:28.693 --> 48:31.403
Is it all right about Mrs. Tuttle...

48:31.571 --> 48:33.489
Buttle's check?

48:34.574 --> 48:36.241
Can I forget it?

48:36.826 --> 48:39.745
What a relief. I'm gonna have nightmares.

48:42.957 --> 48:44.041
Damn! Blast!

48:45.293 --> 48:47.044
What's the matter?

48:47.629 --> 48:51.090
You don't happen to know
how to get round an IRQ/3, do you?

48:51.716 --> 48:54.259
AII information
on third level suspects is classified.

48:54.469 --> 48:58.806
AII inquiries through Information Retrieval.
That's hopeless, they'll tell you nothing.

48:58.890 --> 49:02.017
Come the time they want something
from us, yes.

49:02.227 --> 49:04.520
There's one way I could get round it.

49:04.687 --> 49:08.482
- I could accept my mother's promotion.
- Yes.

49:08.733 --> 49:09.817
No!

49:11.444 --> 49:13.195
You can't. You turned it down.

49:14.030 --> 49:15.447
I didn't sign the form.

49:17.242 --> 49:18.534
I did it for you.

49:19.994 --> 49:21.787
- You didn't?
- I did.

49:23.206 --> 49:24.206
You didn't!

49:25.125 --> 49:26.333
I did.

49:26.709 --> 49:30.462
- Why did you do that?
- That's what you wanted, isn't it?

49:32.006 --> 49:33.507
I don't know.

49:34.217 --> 49:36.301
I don't know what I want.

49:37.846 --> 49:40.389
Come on, before they turn the lights out.

49:57.448 --> 49:58.699
<i>There is one way around it.</i>

49:59.534 --> 50:02.870
<i>I could accept promotion</i>
<i>to Information Retrieval.</i>

52:21.426 --> 52:23.218
What are you doing?

52:23.469 --> 52:25.220
My God, what's going on?

52:25.305 --> 52:27.180
Emergency procedures.

52:28.683 --> 52:30.851
I haven't got an emergency.

52:30.935 --> 52:32.477
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

52:32.562 --> 52:35.314
<i>Have a nice day.</i>
<i>This has not been a recording.</i>

52:37.567 --> 52:39.234
Here. Sign that.

52:40.945 --> 52:42.154
What is it?

52:42.238 --> 52:45.615
It's a 27B/6. What do you think it is?
Where is he?

52:45.908 --> 52:48.243
Spoor, come here. I found it.

52:49.912 --> 52:51.621
Spoor, come here!

52:51.789 --> 52:55.334
Look there, a bypass valve
on the transformer.

53:08.139 --> 53:10.140
You've had that scab Tuttle here.

53:10.683 --> 53:11.683
What are you talking about?

53:12.977 --> 53:15.187
Who fixed your ducts?

53:16.230 --> 53:19.149
I told you before, they fixed themselves.

53:19.776 --> 53:22.235
Where did this come from,
out of your nostril?

53:28.034 --> 53:29.785
Central Services.

53:32.288 --> 53:34.873
They don't take kindly to sabotage.

53:39.045 --> 53:41.546
This place is in a terrible state.

53:42.507 --> 53:45.634
Just a minute. You're not gonna
leave it like this, are you?

53:45.885 --> 53:47.010
Why not?

53:47.095 --> 53:50.597
AII you got to do is blow your nose
and it's fixed, isn't it?

54:29.178 --> 54:31.972
<i>What have you done with his body?</i>

57:50.796 --> 57:54.299
<i>Mrs. Ida Lowry requests the pleasure</i>
<i>of your company</i>

57:54.383 --> 57:57.344
<i>at her apartment tonight from 8:30</i>

58:00.473 --> 58:02.057
<i>to midnight</i>

58:02.558 --> 58:04.809
<i>To celebrate the completion</i>

58:04.894 --> 58:07.228
<i>of her recent cosmetic</i>

58:07.563 --> 58:09.939
<i>surgery</i>

58:29.669 --> 58:30.919
Thanks.

58:31.212 --> 58:32.879
It's reply paid.

58:33.214 --> 58:34.422
Is it?

58:38.844 --> 58:40.178
Two, three.

58:40.262 --> 58:43.598
<i>Mother, I'm sorry but I am unable</i>
<i>to come to your party</i>

58:43.724 --> 58:45.850
You don't have to sing it.

58:45.935 --> 58:47.268
I don't?

58:54.443 --> 58:57.278
Aren't you a bit late?
The party started an hour ago.

58:57.405 --> 59:00.156
Yes, it's backlog. Everybody complains.

59:00.783 --> 59:02.951
Was it all right otherwise?

59:12.086 --> 59:15.797
<i>Mr. Helpmann, I'm keen</i>
<i>to get into Information Retrieval.</i>

59:16.006 --> 59:19.134
<i>Mr. Helpmann,</i>
<i>I'm dying to get at this woman.</i>

59:28.811 --> 59:30.687
Where's your invitation?

59:30.813 --> 59:32.981
Don't shoot! Mother!

59:35.276 --> 59:38.653
Sam, I'm so glad you came.

59:39.947 --> 59:41.197
Come in.

59:41.949 --> 59:43.158
Mother?

59:45.494 --> 59:47.954
Oh, God, Mother, is that you?

59:48.038 --> 59:50.874
Of course. Isn't it wonderful?

59:51.292 --> 59:54.169
The bandages came off just this afternoon.

59:54.545 --> 59:56.796
Come on, darling, join in the fun.

59:56.881 --> 59:59.215
Simply everybody's here.

59:59.341 --> 01:00:02.135
- Is Mr. Helpmann here? Stop shoving!
- He is.

01:00:02.219 --> 01:00:05.513
Mr. Helpmann is here,
and he wants to talk to you.

01:00:05.639 --> 01:00:07.807
Good. I want to talk to him.

01:00:07.892 --> 01:00:11.728
He says you're the first person
ever to refuse a promotion.

01:00:11.854 --> 01:00:15.815
- He thinks you should see a doctor.
- Actually, Mother, I've decided...

01:00:16.567 --> 01:00:18.359
Louis, you know Sam.

01:00:19.195 --> 01:00:20.987
Can you believe it?

01:00:21.363 --> 01:00:23.865
It's just me and my little knife.

01:00:23.991 --> 01:00:25.241
Snip.

01:00:25.534 --> 01:00:26.743
Slice.

01:00:27.411 --> 01:00:30.121
- Can you believe it?
- Congratulations.

01:00:30.206 --> 01:00:32.791
- But this is just the beginning.
- Really?

01:00:32.875 --> 01:00:35.668
Of course, yes.
You've seen her with her clothes off.

01:00:35.753 --> 01:00:38.880
Faces are a doddle
compared to tits and ass.

01:00:38.964 --> 01:00:42.884
- No hairlines.
- Really, Louis!

01:00:43.385 --> 01:00:46.095
I've been looking for you everywhere.

01:00:50.726 --> 01:00:53.561
Mother, I have to talk to Mr. Helpmann.

01:00:54.063 --> 01:00:56.314
- You stupid sod.
- Dear boy

01:00:57.316 --> 01:00:59.901
what do you think of your mother now?

01:00:59.985 --> 01:01:01.736
It will never last.

01:01:04.198 --> 01:01:05.573
Excuse me.

01:01:05.741 --> 01:01:07.909
Dr. Chapman, did you say something?

01:01:08.035 --> 01:01:10.370
That technique, I've tried it.

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.915
A nice effect, but highly unstable.

01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:17.752
In six months,
she'll look like Grandma Moses.

01:01:18.254 --> 01:01:20.088
See here, Chapman.

01:01:20.172 --> 01:01:24.092
At least mine don't end up looking
like they've been mugged.

01:01:29.098 --> 01:01:33.351
<i>What have you done with his body?</i>

01:01:37.898 --> 01:01:41.442
- What happened to you?
- There's a little complication.

01:01:41.527 --> 01:01:46.114
Dr. Chapman says it often happens
with a delicate skin like mine.

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:48.616
Nothing to worry about.

01:01:48.742 --> 01:01:52.120
He's promised these bandages
will be off in a jiffy.

01:01:52.246 --> 01:01:55.623
- Actually, there's someone I want to meet.
- I know.

01:01:59.461 --> 01:02:00.920
Here we are.

01:02:02.548 --> 01:02:05.633
I'm going to leave you two lovebirds
in peace.

01:02:07.887 --> 01:02:09.637
Hello, Shirley.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.932
Come on.

01:02:13.559 --> 01:02:15.393
Do you want a drink?

01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:23.234
Chase those years away.

01:02:23.319 --> 01:02:24.986
Listen, Shirley.

01:02:25.571 --> 01:02:29.157
Look, your mother and my mother
have the idea that...

01:02:30.326 --> 01:02:31.910
Look, I'm very flattered.

01:02:31.994 --> 01:02:35.663
And, well, I just don't want you
to be under any false impressions.

01:02:35.748 --> 01:02:37.332
It's all right.

01:02:37.625 --> 01:02:39.667
I don't like you, either.

01:02:42.171 --> 01:02:43.254
Sam!

01:02:44.506 --> 01:02:46.966
Jack! Excuse me, Shirley.

01:02:48.302 --> 01:02:49.844
I'm sorry.

01:02:52.848 --> 01:02:54.849
- Do you remember Alison?
- Good evening.

01:02:54.975 --> 01:02:57.435
Alison, Sam Lowry, an old friend.

01:02:57.519 --> 01:02:59.520
Alison, yes, of course.

01:03:00.356 --> 01:03:02.857
- You look different.
- I'm two years older.

01:03:02.983 --> 01:03:06.110
And she's been to Dr. Jaffe.
She doesn't like me telling people.

01:03:06.195 --> 01:03:08.196
But, in fact, she's really pleased.

01:03:08.322 --> 01:03:12.116
- I knew there was something different.
- Remember how they used to stick out?

01:03:12.201 --> 01:03:13.368
What?

01:03:13.535 --> 01:03:15.870
Yes, well, rather.

01:03:16.455 --> 01:03:20.291
- I always used to wonder if they were real.
- What, my ears?

01:03:23.045 --> 01:03:26.214
- Dr. Jaffe pinned her ears back.
- Yes, that's...

01:03:27.132 --> 01:03:29.509
I always wondered if she wore falsies.

01:03:29.593 --> 01:03:31.094
Mr. Helpmann.

01:03:32.221 --> 01:03:33.596
False ears.

01:03:35.099 --> 01:03:37.558
- Hello, Jack.
- You remember my wife, Alison?

01:03:37.685 --> 01:03:41.062
Of course, Barbara, isn't it? How are you?

01:03:41.188 --> 01:03:43.690
Barbara's very well. How are you?

01:03:43.899 --> 01:03:45.400
- Fine, thanks.
- Good.

01:03:45.526 --> 01:03:49.612
Hello, Sam. Ida said you might be here.
Have you got a minute?

01:03:49.947 --> 01:03:51.781
Would you excuse us?

01:03:52.366 --> 01:03:55.201
Of course. Come on, Alison. Barbara.

01:03:57.371 --> 01:03:58.413
Sam,

01:04:02.751 --> 01:04:04.419
I need your help.

01:04:27.651 --> 01:04:29.235
Thanks very much.

01:04:29.319 --> 01:04:31.696
Mr. Helpmann, I'm glad to be of help.

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:33.948
And if I can help you...

01:04:40.122 --> 01:04:42.623
Your father and I were very close.

01:04:43.167 --> 01:04:47.295
Of course, Jeremiah was senior to me,
but we were close friends.

01:04:47.504 --> 01:04:49.797
Especially after the bombing.

01:04:51.175 --> 01:04:54.802
And now I keep his name alive
at the office every day.

01:04:55.971 --> 01:04:58.765
It's as though he's there
still speaking to me.

01:04:59.099 --> 01:05:00.600
"'Ere I am

01:05:02.352 --> 01:05:03.519
"J. H."

01:05:06.482 --> 01:05:08.524
The ghost in the machine.

01:05:11.153 --> 01:05:13.988
I know he would've wanted me to help you.

01:05:16.658 --> 01:05:18.785
And I promised your mother

01:05:19.161 --> 01:05:22.955
that I'd take you onto the team
at Information Retrieval.

01:05:23.665 --> 01:05:26.334
- But I gather that you...
- Well,

01:05:27.044 --> 01:05:30.171
actually, Mr. Helpmann,
I've changed my mind.

01:05:30.964 --> 01:05:33.674
I've decided I'd accept the transfer.

01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:36.344
If I'm not too late.

01:05:37.387 --> 01:05:38.721
Too late?

01:05:38.972 --> 01:05:40.848
That's for me to say.

01:05:42.226 --> 01:05:44.018
Well, then I am...

01:05:46.814 --> 01:05:49.315
Welcome to Information Retrieval.

01:06:22.766 --> 01:06:24.433
My name's Lowry.

01:06:25.894 --> 01:06:27.228
Sam Lowry.

01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:31.107
I've been told to report to Mr. Warrenn.

01:06:31.733 --> 01:06:33.568
Thirtieth floor, sir.

01:06:33.735 --> 01:06:35.403
You're expected.

01:06:39.575 --> 01:06:42.326
- Don't you want to search me?
- No, sir.

01:06:44.746 --> 01:06:47.248
- Want to see my ID?
- No need, sir.

01:06:49.585 --> 01:06:52.795
- But I could be anybody.
- No, you couldn't, sir.

01:06:52.921 --> 01:06:55.256
This is Information Retrieval.

01:06:56.508 --> 01:06:58.593
The lift's arrived, sir.

01:08:46.743 --> 01:08:49.620
Half as terrorists, rest as victims.

01:08:50.622 --> 01:08:51.997
Definitely, no.

01:08:52.082 --> 01:08:54.582
My name's Lowry, Mr. Warrenn.
Sam Lowry.

01:08:54.667 --> 01:08:57.920
Yes. No. Cancel that. Okay.

01:08:59.214 --> 01:09:01.340
Glad to have you on board.

01:09:03.385 --> 01:09:05.678
Don't be ridiculous, Jenkins.

01:09:06.138 --> 01:09:07.263
Yes.

01:09:07.555 --> 01:09:09.932
You'll like it up here.

01:09:10.058 --> 01:09:13.519
We've got a crack team of...
Are they kidding? ...decision makers.

01:09:13.603 --> 01:09:17.857
In triplicate. I'm expecting big things...
Two copies to Finance! ...of you.

01:09:21.778 --> 01:09:23.696
Between you and me, Lowry,

01:09:23.947 --> 01:09:27.283
this department is about to be upgraded.

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:31.537
Here we are.

01:09:31.747 --> 01:09:34.415
Your very own number
on your very own door.

01:09:34.624 --> 01:09:37.460
And behind that door, your very own office.

01:09:37.544 --> 01:09:40.712
Congratulations, DZ/015.

01:09:41.089 --> 01:09:42.715
Welcome to the team.

01:09:42.883 --> 01:09:45.216
Yes. No. Cancel that.

01:09:45.426 --> 01:09:47.595
Send two copies to Finance.

01:11:20.772 --> 01:11:24.525
You can't borrow any more chairs!
There's only one left in here now

01:11:24.609 --> 01:11:27.111
- and I need that to sit on!
- What?

01:11:30.157 --> 01:11:31.365
Sorry.

01:11:32.701 --> 01:11:34.160
Who are you?

01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:37.037
My name's Lowry. Sam Lowry.

01:11:37.205 --> 01:11:39.999
Oh, yes, the new boy from next door.

01:11:41.668 --> 01:11:43.919
My name's Lime. Harvey Lime.

01:11:44.629 --> 01:11:46.422
Welcome to Expediting.

01:11:46.548 --> 01:11:49.967
Would you mind
if I borrowed your computer console?

01:11:50.051 --> 01:11:52.803
I'll let you have it back in 10 minutes.

01:11:52.888 --> 01:11:55.973
You want to take my console
into your office?

01:11:56.349 --> 01:11:58.601
Yes, just for a few minutes.

01:11:58.768 --> 01:12:00.478
I'll tell you what,

01:12:00.562 --> 01:12:03.898
you tell me what you want,
and I'll do it for you.

01:12:05.066 --> 01:12:07.359
I'm a bit of a whiz on that thing.

01:12:10.071 --> 01:12:11.447
AII right.

01:12:13.366 --> 01:12:16.952
- I need information on a woman named...
- A woman?

01:12:17.537 --> 01:12:18.996
- I see.
- Yes.

01:12:19.331 --> 01:12:23.334
I know her age and distinguishing marks,
but I need an address, her place of work.

01:12:23.418 --> 01:12:25.669
This your dream girl, is it?

01:12:28.548 --> 01:12:30.841
Look, let me use your console.

01:12:31.259 --> 01:12:33.052
You must be joking.

01:12:33.386 --> 01:12:36.972
When there's a woman involved,
there's no stopping me.

01:12:37.933 --> 01:12:39.850
Let's have that sheet.

01:12:49.069 --> 01:12:50.903
Sod it, it's broken!

01:12:51.112 --> 01:12:53.531
But you haven't switched it on.

01:12:54.199 --> 01:12:55.449
Oh, yes.

01:12:59.704 --> 01:13:01.830
You're putting me off standing there.
Go back to your office.

01:13:01.915 --> 01:13:04.833
I'll give you a knock when I've finished.

01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:08.254
Go on, I'm not going to elope with her.

01:13:09.589 --> 01:13:10.965
AII right.

01:13:46.668 --> 01:13:47.835
Sam!

01:14:11.151 --> 01:14:12.276
Sam.

01:14:15.697 --> 01:14:17.031
Don't go.

01:14:19.326 --> 01:14:20.534
Please.

01:14:33.506 --> 01:14:34.673
Well?

01:14:35.717 --> 01:14:38.886
- Computers are my forte.
- Let me see.

01:14:40.138 --> 01:14:44.475
"Gillian Layton. Coloring: white.
Hair: blonde. Eyes: blue. Height: 5'4".

01:14:44.559 --> 01:14:47.061
"Distinguishing scar on left..."

01:14:48.146 --> 01:14:49.229
Is this all you've got?

01:14:49.648 --> 01:14:53.400
Best to take things slowly
where some women are concerned.

01:14:53.693 --> 01:14:55.069
Let me see.

01:14:56.196 --> 01:14:57.905
Hey, that's mine!

01:14:59.157 --> 01:15:00.491
"Layton.

01:15:01.868 --> 01:15:04.078
"Truck driver. AII inquiries

01:15:04.162 --> 01:15:07.915
"reference officer 412/L. Room 5001."

01:15:11.211 --> 01:15:12.586
Lowry, glad I caught you.

01:15:12.712 --> 01:15:16.173
Send that back. Settling down?
I want this order rescinded.

01:15:16.257 --> 01:15:20.010
There's a query about a personnel
transporter you took out from the pool.

01:15:20.095 --> 01:15:23.013
Or was it a personnel carrier you took?

01:15:23.098 --> 01:15:27.559
Send that up to Security.
Anyway, tidy it up, there's a good chap.

01:15:27.852 --> 01:15:30.396
Get a new suit. You want the lift?

01:16:47.849 --> 01:16:49.475
Can I help you?

01:16:56.524 --> 01:16:58.609
I'm looking for Officer 412/L.

01:16:59.027 --> 01:17:01.153
He won't be very long now.

01:17:04.699 --> 01:17:05.699
I thought so.

01:17:12.373 --> 01:17:14.082
You may go in now.

01:17:19.422 --> 01:17:21.590
Not that one. That one.

01:17:22.634 --> 01:17:23.717
Yes.

01:17:31.559 --> 01:17:34.061
Excuse me, are you officer 412/L?

01:17:41.069 --> 01:17:42.444
Excuse me!

01:17:44.989 --> 01:17:45.989
Jack!

01:17:49.327 --> 01:17:52.496
I heard you were coming aboard.
Congratulations.

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:54.915
- DZ/015.
- Thanks.

01:17:55.583 --> 01:17:57.125
Are you officer 412/L?

01:17:58.586 --> 01:18:00.420
That's me. For Sam.

01:18:00.588 --> 01:18:03.465
- A very happy Christmas.
- Thanks, Jack.

01:18:03.758 --> 01:18:06.635
- You're settling in all right?
- Yes, fine.

01:18:07.428 --> 01:18:08.595
I need some information.

01:18:09.097 --> 01:18:12.808
This is Information Retrieval,
not Information Dispersal.

01:18:13.101 --> 01:18:15.853
Amy, don't throw the ball around in here.

01:18:16.145 --> 01:18:19.857
- I'm not Amy, I'm Holly.
- Did I call you Amy, darling? I am sorry.

01:18:19.941 --> 01:18:21.775
- A triplet?
- One of them, I think.

01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:25.028
Barbara's taken
the other two Christmas shopping.

01:18:25.113 --> 01:18:27.906
You're not gonna
keep calling her Barbara, are you?

01:18:27.991 --> 01:18:31.743
Why not? Barbara's a perfectly good name,
isn't it? Don't you like it?

01:18:33.371 --> 01:18:35.122
Yes, it's fine.

01:18:36.207 --> 01:18:38.792
Come on, let's get these together.

01:18:41.296 --> 01:18:43.130
I need to find out about a woman.

01:18:43.214 --> 01:18:46.717
Come on, Chloe, let's show Uncle Sam
how we make the word "cat."

01:18:46.801 --> 01:18:48.510
- Shall we?
- I'm Holly.

01:18:48.636 --> 01:18:50.220
Sorry, love. So you are.

01:18:50.305 --> 01:18:51.805
This is her.

01:18:53.725 --> 01:18:55.851
Layton. Oh, shit.

01:18:59.022 --> 01:19:01.315
- How much do you know about this?
- Not much.

01:19:01.399 --> 01:19:04.192
- What does B58/732 mean to you?
- Buttle.

01:19:05.987 --> 01:19:08.822
I knew it. You always were bloody quick.

01:19:10.074 --> 01:19:11.408
Who else knows?

01:19:11.492 --> 01:19:13.243
Warrenn? Helpmann?

01:19:13.578 --> 01:19:15.913
I don't know.
I only know you got the wrong man.

01:19:16.623 --> 01:19:18.874
Information Transit got the wrong man.

01:19:18.958 --> 01:19:22.502
I got the right man. The wrong man
was delivered to me as the right man.

01:19:22.587 --> 01:19:25.714
I accepted him on good faith
as the right man.

01:19:25.882 --> 01:19:26.882
Was I wrong?

01:19:27.634 --> 01:19:28.884
You killed Buttle?

01:19:30.929 --> 01:19:34.514
There are rigid parameters laid down
to prevent such things happening.

01:19:34.599 --> 01:19:38.310
It wasn't my fault that Buttle's
heart condition wasn't on Tuttle's file.

01:19:38.394 --> 01:19:40.062
How are you getting on?

01:19:43.024 --> 01:19:45.192
- I really need to know about...
- Tuttle?

01:19:45.276 --> 01:19:47.235
We'll bring Tuttle in

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:50.906
and interrogate him
at the same voltage as Mr. Buttle.

01:19:51.032 --> 01:19:53.200
And juggle the books in electrical banking.

01:19:53.534 --> 01:19:57.412
- What has Tuttle done?
- We suspect him of freelance subversion.

01:19:57.872 --> 01:19:59.206
Freelance subversive?

01:19:59.290 --> 01:20:02.960
Then all I need to wrap up the case
is the Layton woman.

01:20:03.419 --> 01:20:07.255
- What has she done?
- She witnessed the Tuttle... Buttle arrest.

01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:10.467
Since then she's been going around
making wild allegations

01:20:10.551 --> 01:20:12.260
trying to exploit the situation.

01:20:12.345 --> 01:20:14.721
She's working for someone,
and I don't think it's us.

01:20:15.974 --> 01:20:17.349
Terrorist?

01:20:20.228 --> 01:20:22.604
<i>Mr. Lint, the next customer</i>
<i>has been delivered.</i>

01:20:22.689 --> 01:20:25.148
- Thank you, Myrtle.
- What're you gonna do about Layton?

01:20:25.566 --> 01:20:29.444
I put her on the detention list.
Security should have her here before 6:00.

01:20:30.613 --> 01:20:32.030
What, here?

01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:35.409
So that she can spill the beans
inside the department?

01:20:35.493 --> 01:20:36.743
Don't do that.

01:20:38.287 --> 01:20:41.456
Why don't I try and get to her for you? I'll...

01:20:41.916 --> 01:20:44.876
- I'll deactivate her.
- What does that mean?

01:20:44.961 --> 01:20:46.920
I want nothing unsavory.

01:20:47.255 --> 01:20:48.714
Trust me, Jack.

01:20:49.882 --> 01:20:52.217
Come on, put these away.
Mommy will be back.

01:20:52.301 --> 01:20:53.301
Let me have her file.

01:20:56.055 --> 01:20:57.639
Trust me, Jack.

01:20:58.975 --> 01:21:00.350
AII right.

01:21:03.187 --> 01:21:06.064
But for Christ's sake, don't lose it.

01:21:08.317 --> 01:21:09.776
You sit down there, darling.

01:21:11.696 --> 01:21:13.155
Don't worry, I'll get to her.

01:21:13.239 --> 01:21:15.532
You'll never get anywhere
in a suit like that.

01:21:17.410 --> 01:21:18.577
Here.

01:21:20.705 --> 01:21:22.039
Try this.

01:21:22.957 --> 01:21:24.541
- Bye-bye.
- 'Bye.

01:21:26.586 --> 01:21:28.170
But, Jack, I...

01:21:29.756 --> 01:21:33.383
Put it on, big boy. I won't look at your willy.

01:21:44.604 --> 01:21:46.021
Let him go.

01:23:28.666 --> 01:23:29.749
Shit!

01:23:44.765 --> 01:23:45.891
Oi!

01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:48.018
- Come out of there.
- What?

01:23:48.102 --> 01:23:50.604
That's the Deputy Minister's lift.

01:23:50.938 --> 01:23:52.856
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

01:23:53.274 --> 01:23:56.193
Come here, sonny. Let's see your ID card.

01:23:56.277 --> 01:23:57.444
My ID?

01:23:57.737 --> 01:23:58.945
Oh, God!

01:24:00.448 --> 01:24:01.990
This isn't my suit.

01:24:02.283 --> 01:24:04.743
Look, my name's Lowry, Sam Lowry.

01:24:05.119 --> 01:24:07.913
- Look, really, can't this wait?
- No, sir.

01:24:08.456 --> 01:24:10.790
I'm going to have to fill in a report on this.

01:24:10.917 --> 01:24:13.460
Now, then, what is the date today?

01:24:13.961 --> 01:24:16.129
It's the... Oh, God, it'll have to wait!

01:24:16.214 --> 01:24:17.797
You, stop!

01:24:49.997 --> 01:24:51.039
Stop!

01:25:05.054 --> 01:25:07.681
Well done, men. Quick thinking.

01:25:08.683 --> 01:25:10.308
Excellent work.

01:25:12.478 --> 01:25:14.521
I'll take charge of her now.

01:25:14.647 --> 01:25:15.855
Good.

01:25:18.025 --> 01:25:19.192
Okay.

01:25:21.237 --> 01:25:24.572
It's a classified matter.

01:25:26.367 --> 01:25:31.204
I'll include your fine handling
of the situation in my report.

01:25:32.206 --> 01:25:33.415
Great.

01:25:35.918 --> 01:25:38.003
Merry Christmas, Dawson.

01:25:38.504 --> 01:25:40.672
Come along with me, please.

01:25:40.756 --> 01:25:43.258
Okay, thanks. Well done, men.

01:25:43.926 --> 01:25:47.053
Excellent. Good turnout.
Very good, thank you.

01:26:07.908 --> 01:26:09.367
Just keep moving.

01:26:09.452 --> 01:26:10.869
Hey, stop!

01:26:12.872 --> 01:26:14.414
Come back here.

01:26:14.749 --> 01:26:16.583
Pick up all these things.

01:26:16.917 --> 01:26:18.793
Come on, pick them up.

01:26:20.129 --> 01:26:21.588
Disgraceful.

01:26:22.715 --> 01:26:24.382
Can't you even...

01:26:24.467 --> 01:26:26.468
You illiterate foreign pig!

01:26:26.594 --> 01:26:29.804
You come over here
from your own filthy country

01:26:31.807 --> 01:26:33.892
and mess up our streets.

01:26:34.769 --> 01:26:35.935
God!

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:53.161
Well done! Let's go!

01:26:58.042 --> 01:27:01.461
What are you doing?
For Christ's sake, keep moving!

01:27:03.130 --> 01:27:04.672
Get out of my cab.

01:27:04.799 --> 01:27:06.549
What? Just drive!

01:27:08.636 --> 01:27:12.222
- You've touched me. Nobody touches me.
- What do you...

01:27:13.015 --> 01:27:16.017
Please, drive on! Drive on, will you?

01:27:16.143 --> 01:27:17.727
Shit. Move over, I'll drive.

01:27:17.812 --> 01:27:20.647
Don't touch that! Don't touch anything!

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:28.029
It's okay, Officer. Thank you.
I've got everything under control.

01:27:28.531 --> 01:27:30.031
Oh, shit!

01:27:30.699 --> 01:27:35.161
Listen, please drive. Trust me.
You are in terrible danger.

01:27:35.371 --> 01:27:37.038
You're an embarrassment.

01:27:37.373 --> 01:27:39.332
Please drive. Trust me.

01:27:39.667 --> 01:27:41.793
Drive and I'll explain everything.

01:27:41.877 --> 01:27:44.879
Please, get out of my cab.

01:27:47.216 --> 01:27:48.591
I'm sorry, I...

01:27:48.801 --> 01:27:53.096
Okay, you've asked for it.
I'm Information Retrieval Officer

01:27:54.515 --> 01:27:57.267
DZ/105 and I'm arresting you so

01:27:58.102 --> 01:28:01.271
drive on, or I'll blast your fucking head off!

01:28:03.858 --> 01:28:04.858
Go!

01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:29.549
Look, I'm sorry about that.
I mean, touching you without permission.

01:28:30.718 --> 01:28:33.970
Hello, my name's Lowry. Sam Lowry.

01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:36.931
I've been...

01:28:41.187 --> 01:28:45.190
You won't believe this.
I know it will sound incredible

01:28:45.774 --> 01:28:48.318
but I've been dreaming about you.

01:28:48.944 --> 01:28:51.905
No, not like that. I mean, I love you.

01:28:52.448 --> 01:28:55.783
I mean, in my dreams, I love you and...

01:28:58.162 --> 01:29:00.205
Extraordinary, isn't it?

01:29:03.959 --> 01:29:05.293
Anyway.

01:29:10.966 --> 01:29:13.259
You don't believe me, do you?

01:29:15.137 --> 01:29:19.849
You probably think I'm bonkers, right?
Mad, raving.

01:29:21.519 --> 01:29:24.604
No! I think you're very attractive.

01:29:27.066 --> 01:29:28.233
What?

01:29:28.943 --> 01:29:31.861
Yeah. Sit back. Let me have a look at you.

01:29:40.079 --> 01:29:41.412
Oh, yeah.

01:29:42.456 --> 01:29:44.958
Good looking, sexy. Just my type.

01:29:48.254 --> 01:29:50.088
I don't believe you.

01:29:50.839 --> 01:29:52.131
Why not?

01:29:52.716 --> 01:29:55.843
Well, I just don't deserve such terrific luck.

01:29:57.513 --> 01:29:59.222
You're damn right.

01:31:46.622 --> 01:31:48.498
You don't trust me, do you?

01:32:23.867 --> 01:32:27.870
- Oh, my God, we shouldn't have come here!
- I've got a job to do.

01:32:28.414 --> 01:32:30.206
But they'll be lying in wait!

01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:33.793
Christ, you're paranoid.
You got no sense of reality.

01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:35.586
Wait!

01:32:39.967 --> 01:32:43.553
- We should take the lorry and get away!
- Yeah, where to?

01:32:43.637 --> 01:32:47.056
- Anywhere. As fast as possible.
- There isn't anywhere.

01:32:47.141 --> 01:32:50.143
- Just far away.
- It's not far enough.

01:33:07.494 --> 01:33:08.661
Jill!

01:34:01.965 --> 01:34:03.800
What's in the parcel?

01:34:05.344 --> 01:34:07.094
A Christmas present.

01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:16.687
It's heavy.

01:34:17.689 --> 01:34:19.649
Heavy Christmas present.

01:34:19.733 --> 01:34:22.026
If you don't trust me, open it.

01:34:22.110 --> 01:34:24.445
No, it's fine.

01:34:25.906 --> 01:34:27.907
I'd spoil the wrapping.

01:34:28.367 --> 01:34:33.079
Anyway, if I want you to trust me,
it's only fair that I should trust you.

01:34:40.212 --> 01:34:44.924
Doesn't it bother you, the sort of things
you do at Information Retrieval?

01:34:46.927 --> 01:34:49.595
Suppose you'd rather have terrorists.

01:34:53.934 --> 01:34:57.144
How many actual terrorists
have you met, Sam?

01:35:00.607 --> 01:35:02.733
- Actual terrorists?
- Yeah.

01:35:07.656 --> 01:35:08.948
It's only my first day.

01:35:22.588 --> 01:35:24.005
A roadblock.

01:35:25.465 --> 01:35:27.842
- What're we gonna do?
- Stay calm.

01:35:27.968 --> 01:35:31.012
Don't slow down! Don't stop!

01:35:31.096 --> 01:35:34.307
Please, do as I say. Go straight ahead. Go!

01:35:36.268 --> 01:35:39.020
What the fuck are you doing, you stupid...

01:35:51.283 --> 01:35:54.702
We did it! We broke right through them!

01:36:02.502 --> 01:36:05.379
Faster! Don't let them see you. Just go!

01:36:08.258 --> 01:36:09.800
Keep going! Faster!

01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:14.847
- Please, get your foot down!
- Stay off of me!

01:36:48.465 --> 01:36:49.882
Go faster!

01:36:55.973 --> 01:36:59.308
- What if we lose the house?
- Don't touch anything!

01:37:00.268 --> 01:37:01.978
Don't touch that!

01:37:24.418 --> 01:37:28.921
We did it! We did it!

01:37:35.595 --> 01:37:36.762
Oh, no!

01:37:51.862 --> 01:37:54.196
What would you like for Christmas?

01:37:54.281 --> 01:37:56.073
My own credit card.

01:38:07.419 --> 01:38:09.837
- Why have we come here?
- Go away.

01:38:10.338 --> 01:38:13.424
- Why don't we go back to my flat?
- Forget it.

01:38:13.508 --> 01:38:14.717
You don't trust me?

01:38:14.801 --> 01:38:18.137
Trust you? A man who hijacks my truck,
loses me my job

01:38:18.221 --> 01:38:20.890
has every security man in town
looking for me? Of course I do.

01:38:20.974 --> 01:38:23.225
- I was only trying to help.
- Yeah!

01:38:23.894 --> 01:38:27.104
I don't trust you either.
What's in that parcel?

01:38:27.814 --> 01:38:30.357
You saved it from the lorry.
It must be very special.

01:38:30.442 --> 01:38:33.694
I saved you from the lorry.
You're not very special.

01:38:33.779 --> 01:38:36.363
- I'm gonna open it.
- Don't touch it.

01:38:46.124 --> 01:38:47.249
Sam!

01:38:47.417 --> 01:38:48.918
It's me

01:38:49.336 --> 01:38:50.795
and Shirley.

01:38:53.381 --> 01:38:54.882
Mrs. Terrain!

01:38:59.054 --> 01:39:01.180
- That should hold it.
- Sam?

01:39:01.723 --> 01:39:03.265
Hello, Shirley.

01:39:07.104 --> 01:39:08.646
What's happened to you now?

01:39:08.730 --> 01:39:12.191
My complication had a little complication.

01:39:12.651 --> 01:39:15.861
But Dr. Chapman says I'll soon be up

01:39:15.987 --> 01:39:18.864
and bounding about like a young gazelle.

01:39:19.616 --> 01:39:22.535
You buying a Christmas present
for your mother?

01:39:25.372 --> 01:39:27.414
Yes, a little something.

01:39:27.624 --> 01:39:30.960
Shirley and I come here regular-Iarly.

01:39:32.254 --> 01:39:34.296
We love romantic lingerie.

01:39:38.009 --> 01:39:39.844
Picture me in these.

01:39:45.934 --> 01:39:47.184
Oh, my God!

01:39:47.352 --> 01:39:49.728
Sam, where are you going?

01:40:01.825 --> 01:40:02.992
Jill?

01:40:26.266 --> 01:40:28.017
Are you all right?

01:40:31.021 --> 01:40:33.063
You don't deserve to be!

01:40:33.607 --> 01:40:35.774
What a bloody stupid thing!

01:40:36.359 --> 01:40:38.235
How could you? Look at these people!

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:39.570
My God!

01:40:40.363 --> 01:40:42.531
It was a bomb!

01:40:42.782 --> 01:40:46.202
I should've opened it.
I sat there with it next...

01:40:47.704 --> 01:40:49.872
There's your bomb, asshole!

01:40:54.085 --> 01:40:57.296
A bribe for official monkeys like you.

01:41:01.218 --> 01:41:03.093
Make yourself useful.

01:41:09.935 --> 01:41:11.101
Here!

01:41:16.399 --> 01:41:18.651
Don't touch her! She's hurt.

01:41:21.988 --> 01:41:23.656
Don't touch her!

01:41:27.410 --> 01:41:28.577
Stop!

01:41:37.003 --> 01:41:38.295
Sam, no!

01:41:52.352 --> 01:41:55.104
These helmets make your scalp itch.

01:41:55.188 --> 01:41:58.148
Don't mention it.
And they make you sweat.

01:41:58.608 --> 01:42:01.360
Half the time I can never see
where I'm going.

01:42:01.486 --> 01:42:04.780
It's a great Niagara of perspiration
coming down.

01:42:05.448 --> 01:42:08.951
I'm lucky. I've got these thick eyebrows.

01:42:09.327 --> 01:42:12.538
That keeps it up
and channels it out to the ears.

01:42:12.622 --> 01:42:13.622
Jill!

01:42:13.707 --> 01:42:14.790
Who's he?

01:42:14.874 --> 01:42:18.127
I don't know,
somebody from Information Retrieval.

01:42:18.211 --> 01:42:20.462
They're always hanging around in lingerie.

01:42:20.547 --> 01:42:21.630
Where is she?

01:42:24.884 --> 01:42:26.677
Jill, is that you?

01:42:27.512 --> 01:42:30.514
Excuse me, sir.
That is government property.

01:42:35.645 --> 01:42:37.980
Jill! Answer me!

01:42:39.733 --> 01:42:42.484
I'm looking for a girl with blonde hair.

01:42:42.569 --> 01:42:44.987
She's medium height, green eyes.

01:42:45.071 --> 01:42:48.324
I don't know, sir.
They check all that at the depot.

01:42:48.408 --> 01:42:52.578
We can't allow that.
It's more than our job's worth.

01:42:53.204 --> 01:42:55.080
Jill, you must be here.

01:42:55.165 --> 01:42:58.417
You can fill in an application form
if you're a relative.

01:42:58.543 --> 01:43:00.586
Now do stop, sir, please.

01:43:08.386 --> 01:43:10.262
Sorry about that, sir.

01:43:10.764 --> 01:43:12.222
Regulations.

01:43:18.730 --> 01:43:21.023
This is a black eye
for the department, Lowry.

01:43:21.107 --> 01:43:23.359
I don't care how you behaved at Records.

01:43:23.443 --> 01:43:25.861
Informational Retrieval
is an executive branch.

01:43:26.279 --> 01:43:28.864
We're proud of our reputation
and we protect it.

01:43:28.948 --> 01:43:32.826
That convoy of personnel carriers
is still not accounted for!

01:43:32.952 --> 01:43:35.996
I thought I told you to deal with it.
And what is this mess?

01:43:36.247 --> 01:43:39.291
An empty desk is an efficient desk!
Good God!

01:43:39.459 --> 01:43:43.045
Queries from Security. Searches
from Central Banking about a check.

01:43:43.129 --> 01:43:46.548
Clarification notices from Accounting
about unreturned receipts!

01:43:46.633 --> 01:43:49.593
- Mr. Warrenn, I have to find out...
- Shut up!

01:43:49.969 --> 01:43:52.846
I don't know what's going on here, Lowry.

01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:58.560
But don't think you can intimidate us
with your friends in high places!

01:43:58.645 --> 01:44:00.145
Now shape up!

01:44:04.359 --> 01:44:07.444
Lime, I have to use your computer.

01:44:07.529 --> 01:44:09.988
Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.

01:44:10.323 --> 01:44:13.951
You seem to have rather a lot
to get on with yourself.

01:44:20.708 --> 01:44:21.750
Shit!

01:44:22.836 --> 01:44:24.253
Come off it, Jack.

01:44:24.337 --> 01:44:27.089
Of course you can check
to see if she's been arrested.

01:44:27.173 --> 01:44:32.344
Sorry, Sam, this case has become
more complicated since last we talked.

01:44:32.679 --> 01:44:36.056
But she's innocent, Jack.
She's done nothing wrong.

01:44:36.182 --> 01:44:39.393
Tell that to the wives of the men
she blew up this afternoon.

01:44:39.519 --> 01:44:41.520
She's not alone in all this.

01:44:41.646 --> 01:44:43.605
We just had a report in that Tuttle

01:44:43.690 --> 01:44:47.401
has wrecked an entire flat
and sabotaged adjacent Central Services.

01:44:47.527 --> 01:44:49.945
As a matter of fact,
it looks like in your block.

01:44:50.029 --> 01:44:53.198
I'd keep my eyes open if I were you. 'Bye.

01:44:54.534 --> 01:44:58.287
But, Jack, you don't think Tuttle
and the girl are in league, do you?

01:44:58.371 --> 01:45:01.498
I do. Everything's connected.
AII along the line.

01:45:01.583 --> 01:45:03.917
Cause and effect, that's the beauty of it.

01:45:04.043 --> 01:45:07.754
Our job is to trace the connections
and then reveal them.

01:45:09.883 --> 01:45:14.136
This whole Buttle-Tuttle confusion
was obviously planned from the inside.

01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:15.888
But, Jack...

01:45:16.806 --> 01:45:18.640
She's innocent, Jack.

01:45:20.768 --> 01:45:24.062
- We've always been close, haven't we?
- Yes, Jack.

01:45:24.230 --> 01:45:27.566
Until this all blows over,
just stay away from me.

01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:41.867
It's you!

01:47:42.035 --> 01:47:45.203
What's happening?

01:47:45.872 --> 01:47:48.624
Your thermostat's gone, and then some.

01:47:49.792 --> 01:47:51.668
What happened to my flat?

01:47:51.753 --> 01:47:53.462
Hello? What?

01:47:54.213 --> 01:47:55.714
It's for you, but,

01:47:56.215 --> 01:47:57.966
as you don't live here anymore.

01:47:58.051 --> 01:47:59.468
- What?
- Absolutely.

01:47:59.552 --> 01:48:01.136
Do you know what this is?

01:48:01.220 --> 01:48:04.222
This is an H2206

01:48:04.599 --> 01:48:08.935
authorizing the compulsory,
temporary requisitioning of this flat

01:48:09.062 --> 01:48:11.104
for our necessary repairs.

01:48:14.901 --> 01:48:17.027
Don't forget your receipt!

01:48:19.364 --> 01:48:22.407
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler
for paperwork.

01:48:26.329 --> 01:48:27.663
Bastards!

01:48:40.802 --> 01:48:42.594
What are you doing?

01:49:30.435 --> 01:49:32.561
It's getting cold in here.

01:49:34.772 --> 01:49:35.981
Oh, God!

01:49:36.733 --> 01:49:38.400
It smells badly.

01:49:39.277 --> 01:49:42.028
It's shit! We're filling up with shit!

01:49:58.296 --> 01:49:59.588
Oh, shit.

01:50:01.966 --> 01:50:04.301
We're all in it together, kid.

01:50:16.439 --> 01:50:18.732
Jill!

01:50:23.571 --> 01:50:25.322
Are you all right?

01:50:26.073 --> 01:50:29.743
- What happened to you after...
- Your face. Are you hurt?

01:50:31.621 --> 01:50:33.121
No, I'm fine.

01:50:37.084 --> 01:50:39.586
I've been worried sick about you.

01:50:52.767 --> 01:50:55.560
- Who was that?
- That's a friend of mine.

01:50:57.313 --> 01:50:59.022
Oh, God! Holy shit!

01:50:59.357 --> 01:51:01.316
We better get out of here, quick. Come on.

01:51:07.031 --> 01:51:08.990
Thank God! Here, take it.

01:51:11.327 --> 01:51:12.953
It's not so big.

01:52:05.006 --> 01:52:06.840
Are you sure this is all right?

01:52:06.924 --> 01:52:08.425
Yes, certain.

01:52:09.844 --> 01:52:12.220
My mother's away for Christmas.

01:52:13.306 --> 01:52:16.266
She's spending it at the plastic surgeon's.

01:52:19.353 --> 01:52:21.563
The wraps come off tomorrow.

01:53:02.063 --> 01:53:05.815
Lock the door after me.
Don't answer the phone to anyone.

01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:08.068
I won't be long.

01:53:09.737 --> 01:53:12.405
- Where're you going?
- I know a way to save you.

01:53:12.490 --> 01:53:14.616
Trust me. I can do it.

01:53:14.700 --> 01:53:16.409
You can't go without me!

01:53:52.029 --> 01:53:55.115
Excuse me, Dawson, could you
put me through to Mr. Helpmann's office?

01:53:55.199 --> 01:53:59.327
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have
to go through the proper channels.

01:53:59.412 --> 01:54:02.080
And you can't tell me what
the proper channels are

01:54:02.164 --> 01:54:04.916
because that's classified information.

01:54:05.543 --> 01:54:10.213
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing
its tradition of recruiting the brightest.

01:54:10.965 --> 01:54:12.674
Thank you, Dawson.

01:54:19.807 --> 01:54:22.684
- Goodnight, Mr. Lime.
- Goodnight, Dawson.

01:54:53.591 --> 01:54:57.343
No, no, Arthur. You're flat on the G!

01:54:57.428 --> 01:55:01.056
It's your breathing.
Take a deep breath after "Noel."

01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:03.099
Ready, one, two, three.

01:55:14.737 --> 01:55:18.239
<i>"'Ere I am, J.H."</i>

01:55:19.325 --> 01:55:21.159
<i>The ghost in the machine.</i>

01:55:48.479 --> 01:55:49.979
Mr. Helpmann?

01:56:27.768 --> 01:56:29.269
Mr. Helpmann?

01:57:52.645 --> 01:57:53.811
Jill.

01:58:45.656 --> 01:58:46.656
Who's there?

01:58:55.666 --> 01:58:57.417
What do you think?

01:58:58.460 --> 01:58:59.794
Is it me?

01:59:06.468 --> 01:59:07.635
What?

01:59:13.183 --> 01:59:15.226
You don't exist anymore.

01:59:16.186 --> 01:59:17.854
I've killed you.

01:59:22.651 --> 01:59:24.485
Jill Layton is dead.

01:59:33.245 --> 01:59:35.580
Care for a little necrophilia?

02:00:39.353 --> 02:00:41.020
Merry Christmas.

02:00:54.535 --> 02:00:56.702
Something for an executive?

02:01:15.055 --> 02:01:16.472
She's dead.

02:01:16.890 --> 02:01:18.975
This is a friend of mine.

02:01:21.728 --> 02:01:22.770
No!

02:01:24.231 --> 02:01:25.356
Sam!

02:01:32.281 --> 02:01:35.867
93/HKS/608, you are charged
with the following:

02:01:35.951 --> 02:01:38.369
"Giving aid and comfort
to the enemies of society.

02:01:38.454 --> 02:01:40.746
"Attempting to conceal a fugitive
from justice.

02:01:40.831 --> 02:01:44.417
"Passing confidential documents
to unauthorized personnel.

02:01:44.501 --> 02:01:47.670
"Destroying government property,
viz. several personnel carriers.

02:01:47.754 --> 02:01:50.590
"Taking possession under false pretences
of said carriers.

02:01:50.674 --> 02:01:53.426
"Forging the signature
of the Head of Records.

02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:56.971
"Misdirecting funds in the form
of a check to A. Buttle

02:01:57.055 --> 02:01:58.848
"through unauthorized channels.

02:01:58.932 --> 02:02:00.975
"Tampering with Central Services'
supply ducts.

02:02:01.059 --> 02:02:03.853
"Obstructing forces of law and order.

02:02:03.937 --> 02:02:06.272
"Disgracing the good name
of the government

02:02:06.356 --> 02:02:08.816
"and the Department
of Information Retrieval.

02:02:08.901 --> 02:02:12.695
"Disrupting the Ministry's
internal communicating system.

02:02:13.447 --> 02:02:15.865
"Wasting Ministry time and paper."

02:02:16.825 --> 02:02:20.328
Now, either you can plead guilty
to seven or eight of the charges

02:02:20.412 --> 02:02:23.748
which will help keep costs down
within your means

02:02:23.832 --> 02:02:28.085
or borrow a sum to be negotiated
from us at a very competitive rate.

02:02:28.587 --> 02:02:31.756
We can offer you something
at eleven-and-a-half percent over 30 years

02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:34.926
but you will have to buy insurance
to qualify for this scheme.

02:02:35.135 --> 02:02:37.261
If you prefer something more specific

02:02:37.346 --> 02:02:40.139
say, against electrical charges over £70...

02:02:40.307 --> 02:02:43.100
AII you're requested to do now
is sign this form.

02:02:43.477 --> 02:02:45.061
Think carefully before you sign.

02:02:45.145 --> 02:02:48.481
Thinking ahead in financial matters
is always a wise course.

02:02:48.732 --> 02:02:50.024
Plead guilty.

02:02:50.108 --> 02:02:51.609
It's cheaper.

02:02:56.406 --> 02:02:59.617
Sam, what are we going to do with you?

02:03:02.704 --> 02:03:04.205
Where's Jill?

02:03:05.749 --> 02:03:07.625
I've got to find her.

02:03:08.085 --> 02:03:11.003
Please, you've got to get me out of here.

02:03:11.296 --> 02:03:15.007
I understand, Sam.
I know exactly how you feel

02:03:15.342 --> 02:03:18.302
so I brought you a bottle of barley water.

02:03:18.762 --> 02:03:20.805
Please help me.

02:03:21.431 --> 02:03:24.559
I assure you,
I'm doing everything within my power.

02:03:24.643 --> 02:03:27.520
But the rules of the game are laid down.

02:03:27.896 --> 02:03:30.940
We all have to play by them. Even me.

02:03:32.568 --> 02:03:36.195
It's all a mistake.
You've got to understand that.

02:03:37.072 --> 02:03:41.742
From the Department's point of view,
there was certainly a bit of an own goal.

02:03:41.827 --> 02:03:43.661
I'm not a terrorist.

02:03:44.288 --> 02:03:47.164
You know that. Please get me out of here!

02:03:47.666 --> 02:03:50.501
Sam, Information Retrieval is expensive.

02:03:51.003 --> 02:03:54.088
You're running up an enormous bill
by not cooperating.

02:03:56.508 --> 02:03:58.384
Please, Mr. Helpmann,

02:03:59.344 --> 02:04:01.137
help me find Jill.

02:04:06.685 --> 02:04:09.186
Sam, I think I ought to tell you.

02:04:10.314 --> 02:04:14.108
I'm afraid she's upped stumps
and retired to the pavilion.

02:04:16.653 --> 02:04:18.487
Thrown in the towel.

02:04:19.906 --> 02:04:21.073
Dead?

02:04:22.242 --> 02:04:23.367
Yes.

02:04:24.161 --> 02:04:28.623
It's all a bit confusing, but it seems
she was killed resisting arrest.

02:04:34.004 --> 02:04:36.380
No, it's all right. I did that.

02:04:39.718 --> 02:04:42.595
The odd thing is
it appears to have happened twice.

02:04:42.679 --> 02:04:45.389
A bit of a disputed call, I'm afraid.

02:04:47.517 --> 02:04:48.726
Twice?

02:04:49.978 --> 02:04:54.231
There you are. AII I can say is
don't fall at the last fence.

02:04:54.566 --> 02:04:57.735
The finish is in sight.
See you in the paddock.

02:04:58.070 --> 02:05:00.655
Do cooperate. Think of your mother.

02:05:00.864 --> 02:05:03.240
Good luck. Keep your eye on the ball.

02:05:03.325 --> 02:05:06.410
Got to go. Can't keep the orphans waiting.

02:05:16.004 --> 02:05:17.046
No!

02:05:35.357 --> 02:05:38.943
Don't fight it, son. Confess. Quickly.

02:05:40.278 --> 02:05:44.532
If you hold out too long,
you could jeopardize your credit rating.

02:06:35.375 --> 02:06:36.500
Jack?

02:06:45.635 --> 02:06:46.927
Shut up!

02:06:49.347 --> 02:06:51.932
Jack, I'm innocent. Please help me.

02:06:52.309 --> 02:06:53.601
Bastard!

02:06:56.146 --> 02:06:59.023
Jack, this is all a mistake. Please, Jack.

02:06:59.107 --> 02:07:00.900
Take that mask off.

02:07:06.239 --> 02:07:08.032
You stupid bastard!

02:07:09.993 --> 02:07:11.911
How could you do this to me?

02:07:12.078 --> 02:07:13.662
Jack, I'm frightened.

02:07:13.747 --> 02:07:16.290
How do you think I feel? You shit!

02:07:16.374 --> 02:07:18.042
- Jack...
- Shut up!

02:07:22.756 --> 02:07:26.967
This is a professional relationship.

02:07:30.972 --> 02:07:32.515
You can't!

02:07:34.768 --> 02:07:36.435
No, Jack, please!

02:08:25.902 --> 02:08:27.236
You okay?

02:08:27.362 --> 02:08:28.612
Tuttle!

02:08:29.155 --> 02:08:30.698
Call me Harry.

02:09:18.622 --> 02:09:19.955
Let's go!

02:14:30.183 --> 02:14:33.977
Mr. Lowry, so pleased you could make it.

02:14:34.270 --> 02:14:36.021
Right this way.

02:14:41.486 --> 02:14:43.153
It's a sad loss.

02:14:43.947 --> 02:14:46.114
Your mother was with her at the end.

02:14:50.578 --> 02:14:54.456
Mrs. Terrain has just received
that most wonderful of gifts.

02:14:55.667 --> 02:14:58.001
She came to us physically new.

02:14:58.670 --> 02:15:01.880
She goes hence from us
not so physically new.

02:15:01.965 --> 02:15:04.341
But the spirit never grows old.

02:15:05.927 --> 02:15:07.469
Madam Lowry!

02:15:11.975 --> 02:15:13.225
Mother!

02:15:14.852 --> 02:15:16.061
Sam!

02:15:17.939 --> 02:15:19.356
Mother?

02:15:21.234 --> 02:15:23.068
Stop calling me that.

02:15:25.238 --> 02:15:28.156
Mother, please!

02:15:28.658 --> 02:15:30.784
Is this guy bothering you?

02:15:31.995 --> 02:15:33.036
Mother!

02:15:34.580 --> 02:15:38.458
Go away. This is a very sacred moment.

02:18:48.316 --> 02:18:50.275
He's got away from us, Jack.

02:18:50.359 --> 02:18:53.653
I'm afraid you're right, Mr. Helpmann.
He's gone.

02:19:35.111 --> 02:19:38.656
<i>Tomorrow was another day</i>

02:19:40.117 --> 02:19:44.037
<i>The morning found me miles away</i>

02:19:45.331 --> 02:19:49.626
<i>With still a million things to say</i>

02:19:53.130 --> 02:19:55.382
<i>Now</i>

02:19:56.092 --> 02:20:00.387
<i>As twilight beams the sky above</i>

02:20:01.430 --> 02:20:04.849
<i>Recalling thrills of our love</i>

02:20:06.894 --> 02:20:10.897
<i>There's one thing I'm certain of</i>

02:20:11.649 --> 02:20:16.403
<i>Return I will</i>

02:20:18.239 --> 02:20:24.244
<i>To old Brazil</i>
