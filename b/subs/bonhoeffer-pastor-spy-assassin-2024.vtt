Yeah. He's right.

22:53.165 --> 22:54.665
and only my fast feet

22:54.792 --> 22:57.377
were gonna save me
from the back end of a jail.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.505
So I ran,

23:00.630 --> 23:03.633
but I found myself
not more than thirty yards

23:03.758 --> 23:07.803
from a Baptist revival tent.

23:10.348 --> 23:12.517
And you know who
was waiting for me inside?

23:13.477 --> 23:15.020
The Lord.

23:15.562 --> 23:19.523
He was in every lit-up face
of the gospel singers.

23:19.648 --> 23:23.695
He was in the salty words
of that traveling preacher.

23:24.612 --> 23:26.740
He was in
the sweet loving hands

23:26.865 --> 23:30.160
of that grandmother
that led me to my seat.

23:30.285 --> 23:32.912
But he was also
in the broken souls

23:33.037 --> 23:35.748
of every liar, cheat and sinner

23:35.873 --> 23:37.750
in that blessed tent.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.962
Because Jesus...

23:42.255 --> 23:44.048
was with His people.

23:45.217 --> 23:46.425
Just like He promised.

23:48.010 --> 23:50.930
And, Dietrich,
he filled that place,

23:51.055 --> 23:54.600
so as to tear
at the very seams of that tent.

23:55.477 --> 23:59.313
And he filled me up
to overflowin' ever since.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.525
-I want that.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.405
-Well, it's simple, son.

24:08.657 --> 24:10.200
“Taste.

24:11.493 --> 24:12.993
And see that the Lord is good.”

24:13.953 --> 24:15.288
-I know He's good.

24:15.413 --> 24:17.957
REV POWELL: But do you
know how good?

24:22.795 --> 24:26.173
A man can waste
a whole lifetime...

24:26.550 --> 24:28.677
saying God is good

24:28.927 --> 24:32.930
and never asking Him to show
the fullness of His glory.

24:33.055 --> 24:35.350
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah!

24:35.475 --> 24:36.518
- Whoa.

24:37.393 --> 24:39.897
But hallelujah ain't gonna do
all the work now.

24:40.022 --> 24:43.107
And there is so
much more work to be done.

24:43.233 --> 24:43.942
- Amen.
- That's right.

24:44.067 --> 24:45.860
REV POWELL: Did you see
that black flag

24:45.985 --> 24:47.403
hanging from the building?

24:47.612 --> 24:48.447
-Yes.

24:48.572 --> 24:51.240
FISHER: That's for
Thomas Shipp, innocent man,

24:51.365 --> 24:54.995
lynched three days ago
in Marion, Indiana.

24:56.913 --> 24:58.623
-We may be free in our souls,

24:58.748 --> 25:00.625
but there's
another freedom that we seek.

25:01.710 --> 25:03.962
A God-given freedom

25:04.837 --> 25:07.548
that man has deigned
to take away.

25:09.217 --> 25:13.263
- I am so sorry.

25:13.388 --> 25:15.557
FISHER: We don't need you
to be sorry, D.

25:15.723 --> 25:17.600
We need you
to tell the world.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.727
- Yeah, son.
You think we invited you

25:19.852 --> 25:21.897
just to show you
the good places to eat?

25:22.480 --> 25:23.523
Ha ha!

25:24.398 --> 25:26.233
-We should take him
to South Carolina,

25:26.400 --> 25:28.110
see if he still wants
to hang out with us.

25:29.070 --> 25:31.615
-How about south
of 110th Street?

25:31.740 --> 25:33.450
Dietrich don't know
he in Negro heaven.

25:34.492 --> 25:36.118
REV POWELL: That's a
brilliant idea.

25:36.828 --> 25:38.830
Frank, why don't you
take him on a road trip?

25:41.373 --> 25:42.875
-How far you think
we should go?

25:43.252 --> 25:47.213
REV POWELL: I think to be safe,
let's say DC.

25:47.713 --> 25:51.217
He can see Lincoln statue
and the white man's statutes.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.553
See which one speaks louder.

25:59.683 --> 26:02.812
-Got you again.
Olly olly oxen free.

26:04.022 --> 26:05.898
-Goose Goslin with the goner.

26:12.947 --> 26:14.573
-Our friendship is not as...

26:14.992 --> 26:16.743
alien as you predicted.

26:17.452 --> 26:19.620
-We haven't
asked for anything yet.

26:23.165 --> 26:26.377
Go book a room,
pay for it, come get me after.

26:33.092 --> 26:36.303
-Good evening.
A room. Just for a night.

26:37.972 --> 26:39.098
-That'll be $2.

26:46.773 --> 26:47.940
-Two dollars, huh.

26:48.525 --> 26:49.858
Seems fair.

26:50.568 --> 26:52.070
- Let's go see how fair.

27:01.245 --> 27:02.622
-No rooms to let.

27:03.415 --> 27:04.748
- Good night.
- Kind sir.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.500
My friend just booked a room.

27:07.210 --> 27:10.130
He paid a good two dollars.
He invited me here.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.883
Whoa, whoa, sir.

27:14.008 --> 27:15.135
-Who in hell...

27:15.260 --> 27:17.595
would wanna be friends with
a tar baby like you?

27:17.720 --> 27:21.057
DIETRICH: He's my friend.
I have a key.

27:21.182 --> 27:22.517
[intense musical buildup]

27:24.268 --> 27:26.020
Sir, by the cross on the wall,

27:26.145 --> 27:28.898
I can see that you're
my brother under Christ.

27:29.023 --> 27:30.858
As my friend Frank here is too.

27:32.110 --> 27:34.528
Surely our love
of the Lord unites us.

27:46.207 --> 27:48.125
I paid for this room,

27:48.250 --> 27:49.085
and Frank and I,

27:49.210 --> 27:51.420
we are going to stay in this--

27:52.422 --> 27:53.673
-How dare...

27:54.173 --> 27:58.010
you animals interrupt
my quiet evening

27:58.135 --> 27:59.553
with your violence.

28:01.013 --> 28:05.268
The next one comes
from the other end of this gun.

28:19.657 --> 28:20.908
-Hey, hey, slow down, man.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.827
Dietrich. Where you rushing to?

28:22.952 --> 28:24.703
-I should have torn
that cross off his wall.

28:24.828 --> 28:26.413
-Oh, now, now. Dietrich...

28:26.957 --> 28:28.625
How many cheeks
you have to turn?

28:29.417 --> 28:30.543
Hold on, now. Dietrich!

28:31.418 --> 28:33.337
How many maniacs
do I have to save you from?

28:33.463 --> 28:35.632
-There's always an inn
at the end of the search.

28:35.757 --> 28:38.008
- Always. That much I know.
- Dietrich. Listen to me.

28:38.802 --> 28:42.013
Sometimes there's
just a manger.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.530
DIETRICH: I'm so embarrassed.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.660
I put you in danger.

29:05.370 --> 29:07.330
- No more danger
than I face any day.

29:08.998 --> 29:10.125
-How could I think
it would work,

29:10.250 --> 29:11.793
simply because
I wanted it to work?

29:11.918 --> 29:14.462
-It's alright, D. It's alright.

29:17.590 --> 29:21.302
-I could not raise a hand
against another man.

29:24.638 --> 29:26.140
This kind of hate...

29:28.560 --> 29:32.022
takes something
stronger than a punch.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.818
-Sometimes a punch
makes some necessary noise.

29:37.527 --> 29:38.820
And sometimes...

29:39.112 --> 29:41.447
it's just as useless
as spitting in the wind.

29:43.492 --> 29:47.370
-We're so fortunate not having
anything like this in Germany.

29:48.162 --> 29:49.413
-My brother,

29:50.332 --> 29:52.667
hate comes in every color.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.295
Your eyes just haven't
been opened yet.

30:14.147 --> 30:16.398
-Our hosts must have
a special distaste

30:16.565 --> 30:18.275
for you and me,
Herr Bonhoeffer.

30:20.110 --> 30:21.487
-I don't know you.

30:24.157 --> 30:25.867
-Doctor Sigmund Rascher,

30:25.992 --> 30:28.077
once the Führer's
championed scientist.

30:29.537 --> 30:32.165
And you are
Dietrich Bonhoeffer,

30:32.415 --> 30:34.875
the pastor who
forgot to love his enemy.

30:36.127 --> 30:39.213
- Yeah. I know why I'm here.

30:41.382 --> 30:42.508
But you, you...

30:44.385 --> 30:46.053
were his golden child.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.972
DR RASCHER: The
Führer thanked me

30:48.097 --> 30:50.808
for studying
the Juden's final moments.

30:51.642 --> 30:53.687
To make the choice
to stop a heart.

30:54.603 --> 30:56.605
That is my greatest
accomplishment.

30:58.232 --> 30:59.442
For what is a life...

31:01.318 --> 31:03.445
if we do not
comprehend its ending?

31:09.493 --> 31:13.915
Alas, there was no cure
for my Führer's jealousy.

31:14.790 --> 31:15.792
-Jealousy.

31:16.960 --> 31:20.003
-I made the fatal mistake
of not pretending that

31:20.463 --> 31:22.257
he was smarter than I.

31:22.757 --> 31:24.550
So for all my work,

31:25.968 --> 31:28.972
I get a trap door
and a piece of rope.

31:29.472 --> 31:30.973
[intense music]

31:33.433 --> 31:34.602
-That's what we all get.

31:34.727 --> 31:37.188
- I should be fitted
for a crown...

31:40.525 --> 31:41.525
one day.

31:46.197 --> 31:48.448
Our season may have ended,

31:51.618 --> 31:53.328
but it will come again.

31:56.748 --> 31:57.750
-Your season

32:00.127 --> 32:01.963
ended long ago.

32:02.880 --> 32:07.093
'The light came into the world,

32:08.720 --> 32:11.263
and the darkness
did not overcome it.'

32:13.015 --> 32:15.477
-Look around you, my friend.

32:16.227 --> 32:18.730

33:36.182 --> 33:37.475
- It's called jazz.

33:37.725 --> 33:39.893
And it reinvents your ears
with every note.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.270
-I'm glad you're home, brother.

33:41.395 --> 33:43.022
Germany was emptier
without you.

33:45.942 --> 33:48.402
-Can you tell us one more thing
before I go up?

33:48.737 --> 33:51.572
One thing we couldn't
imagine about America.

33:51.780 --> 33:54.283
-Alright. It's this.

33:55.577 --> 33:56.827
In the German church,

33:56.952 --> 33:59.497
I was headed
into the dead end of religion.

33:59.955 --> 34:01.290
[radio plays news]

34:01.790 --> 34:05.293
Father, did you hear me?

34:05.420 --> 34:06.295
-Yes.

34:06.462 --> 34:08.923
DIETRICH: I don't want to
pursue theology any longer.

34:10.007 --> 34:11.008
KARL: Thank God.

34:12.008 --> 34:14.970
Such a fine mind was always
too good for the church.

34:15.095 --> 34:18.140
DIETRICH: In Harlem,
I finally saw real faith,

34:18.892 --> 34:20.392
instead of dead religion.

34:21.685 --> 34:24.147
And now I plan on teaching
the German church all about it.

34:24.397 --> 34:25.607
-Wait. The church?

34:25.732 --> 34:28.025
But you just said
you were done with religion.

34:28.233 --> 34:30.570
-I am. As should be the church.

34:30.695 --> 34:34.115
KARL: I like that, son.
You're still cocky.

34:34.865 --> 34:36.408
Trying to teach the church?

34:36.533 --> 34:37.577
They sure could use some

34:37.702 --> 34:39.453
damn instructions
at the moment.

34:39.578 --> 34:40.538
-Karl.

34:41.372 --> 34:42.373
HANS: The Nazis rise to power

34:42.498 --> 34:44.500
has everyone
a little anxious, Dietrich.

34:44.958 --> 34:46.210
-The Nazis?

34:47.837 --> 34:51.423
They only got, what was it,
eighteen percent in '30?

34:52.508 --> 34:53.675
And that was a mirage.

34:53.885 --> 34:55.887
-Well, this year's mirage
will double that.

34:56.720 --> 34:57.555
-I don't believe it.

34:58.180 --> 34:59.182
KARL: That's because
you were away

34:59.348 --> 35:01.183
while Hitler used
the Versailles Treaty

35:01.308 --> 35:02.768
like his personal weapon.

35:04.145 --> 35:05.980
Every bad thing
that ever happened in Germany

35:06.105 --> 35:08.357
landed on the doorsteps
of the Jews and the communists,

35:08.482 --> 35:09.733
and there were

35:10.233 --> 35:11.360
enough working people

35:11.485 --> 35:13.320
begging for bread
to believe it.

35:13.445 --> 35:14.988
-There's no
chance that

35:15.113 --> 35:16.782
this loudmouth from Austria

35:16.907 --> 35:18.283
will have fooled
enough Germans by then.

35:18.408 --> 35:20.495
-But Hitler only has to
fool the Germans

35:20.620 --> 35:22.163
who come out to vote.

35:22.288 --> 35:24.457
-But he's still only one man.

35:24.582 --> 35:27.418
If he does somehow
manage to sneak in,

35:27.543 --> 35:29.212
we'll vote him out next time.

35:29.337 --> 35:31.838
Just like we did with
Ebert, and Simons.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.173
-See? Your mother
still believes in

35:33.298 --> 35:34.342
the wisdom of people.

35:34.467 --> 35:35.968
Unfortunately,
that's how tyrants win.

35:36.093 --> 35:37.512
- So now it's my fault
that Hitler

35:37.637 --> 35:38.720
will become chancellor?

35:38.847 --> 35:41.223
KARL: Things have
changed, Paula.

35:41.348 --> 35:43.183
The country has grown angrier,

35:43.308 --> 35:45.060
and people are falling prey

35:45.185 --> 35:47.313
to this nationalism
and paranoia.

35:47.522 --> 35:48.898
HANS: And the Nazis
feed off that.

35:49.023 --> 35:50.148
They've been systematic,

35:50.315 --> 35:51.942
fighting for every
local election,

35:52.067 --> 35:53.360
each tiny hamlet,

35:53.485 --> 35:54.695
prying the country
from our hands

35:54.820 --> 35:56.155
while few were even watching.

35:56.822 --> 35:59.367
And the church, no doubt,
bears some blame.

35:59.492 --> 36:00.200
KARL: Oh, yeah.

36:00.450 --> 36:02.912
Hitler and his
new Bishop Müller

36:03.745 --> 36:05.455
now call it the Reichskirche.

36:05.623 --> 36:07.583
The Church of the Third Reich.

36:07.708 --> 36:09.918
-One man cannot change the name
of the whole church.

36:10.043 --> 36:11.670
KARL: He already has, Dietrich.

36:11.795 --> 36:14.090
HANS: I've heard via my
office that the Nazis plan

36:14.215 --> 36:15.883
to identify and
dispose of people

36:16.008 --> 36:17.427
with mental disabilities.

36:17.635 --> 36:19.095
-Father, that can't be true.

36:20.262 --> 36:23.057
DIETRICH: You speak
in nightmares.

36:24.642 --> 36:27.978
Well, surely rumor and rage
cannot win the day.

36:28.103 --> 36:30.063
-Unless the day
is already lost.

36:35.318 --> 36:37.947
[footsteps]

36:45.580 --> 36:46.997
SABINE: Shouldn't smoke in bed.

36:52.670 --> 36:53.503
DIETRICH: When we were little,

36:53.628 --> 36:55.213
I used to steal
father's cigarettes

36:55.338 --> 36:57.007
and pretend to
smoke them up here.

36:57.132 --> 36:58.008
- Me too.

36:58.133 --> 36:59.593
- Never got past one puff.

37:03.263 --> 37:04.890
I guess we've graduated.

37:05.975 --> 37:11.272
-Remember, we would lie here
staring at the ceiling,

37:11.397 --> 37:13.648
call out to Walter in heaven.

37:14.442 --> 37:15.150
-Yeah.

37:16.527 --> 37:19.238
Every night for years.

37:21.157 --> 37:24.577
-Eternity. Eternity. Eternity.

37:24.827 --> 37:25.577
-Eternity.

37:26.453 --> 37:29.498
Like a song. An invitation.

37:30.833 --> 37:32.543
Eternity. Eternity.
-Eternity.

37:33.252 --> 37:34.503
-It never worked.

37:37.130 --> 37:39.217
-It worked for me once.

37:39.342 --> 37:40.843
-You never told me.

37:41.760 --> 37:44.055
-I didn't want
to make you feel bad.

37:46.432 --> 37:48.558
He was wearing his uniform.

37:50.435 --> 37:51.770
He was walking away

37:51.895 --> 37:53.355
towards an umbrella.

37:53.480 --> 37:54.857
- On a beach.

37:57.150 --> 37:58.735
-He took off his hat.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.613
-And left it in the sand.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.408
And he walked on.

38:04.533 --> 38:05.993
- Towards the sea.

38:10.665 --> 38:12.875
-Must be true
what they say about twins.

38:17.087 --> 38:18.838
-Then you're as afraid as I am.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.508
-I am.

38:23.510 --> 38:26.222
But I don't know why.

38:27.640 --> 38:28.723
-Something's coming.

38:31.768 --> 38:33.603
Something unstoppable.

38:35.857 --> 38:38.483
- Nothing is unstoppable.

38:44.907 --> 38:45.908
SABINE: Eternity.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.785
Eternity. Eternity.

38:51.205 --> 38:52.205
Eternity.

38:53.123 --> 38:54.167
SABINE: Eternity.

38:55.458 --> 38:58.795
Eternity. Eternity.

39:00.463 --> 39:01.340
Eternity.

39:02.592 --> 39:03.967
Eternity.

39:04.093 --> 39:05.343
Eternity.

39:05.468 --> 39:06.720
[intense music]

39:07.137 --> 39:12.225
Eternity... eternity.

39:15.645 --> 39:20.275
Walter, where are you?

39:23.403 --> 39:29.827
Sabine, I can't do this alone.

40:05.028 --> 40:10.075
MÜLLER: Finally, my friends,
we know who we are.

40:11.202 --> 40:17.290
How long have we waited
for this moment

40:17.415 --> 40:23.172
when we can finally hear
Germany's heart beat again?

40:33.473 --> 40:37.352
At last we have
read the writing

40:37.478 --> 40:41.482
on the walls
of this country's soul,

40:42.440 --> 40:44.860
and the words are:

40:44.985 --> 40:48.363
Chancellor Adolf Hitler!

40:51.783 --> 40:55.620
God sent Germany a prophet.

40:56.663 --> 40:59.375
And more than that.

40:59.833 --> 41:01.502
A true Savior!

41:03.087 --> 41:05.463
- To speak of any Savior
but Christ from the pulpit...

41:05.588 --> 41:06.882
blasphemy.

41:07.842 --> 41:11.553
-Dietrich, everything new
needs a moment to settle.

41:13.138 --> 41:14.348
-We're in God's house

41:14.473 --> 41:16.433
and the bishop
is celebrating a man.

41:16.933 --> 41:18.268
I don't need time
to “let it settle.”

41:18.393 --> 41:20.855
MÜLLER: So that we can solve
the great challenges

41:20.980 --> 41:22.690
facing our people.

41:23.065 --> 41:25.567
To combine our shared power

41:25.733 --> 41:29.028
so that we can
achieve this together.

41:29.947 --> 41:31.032
-Alright.

41:31.198 --> 41:32.908
Alright, you don't
support Hitler.

41:33.033 --> 41:33.700
Many don't.

41:33.825 --> 41:36.203
But that doesn't mean that
you can make a distraction...

41:36.328 --> 41:37.370
DIETRICH: They are building
an idol to Hitler

41:37.495 --> 41:38.705
inside those walls
in real time.

41:39.748 --> 41:41.542
NIEMÖLLER: You're exaggerating,
Dietrich.

41:42.292 --> 41:45.795
You've been away quite a while,

41:46.172 --> 41:47.715
while this man
has been building--

41:47.840 --> 41:49.425
-building what?

41:49.675 --> 41:51.510
An army of clergy,
blinded by...

41:52.093 --> 41:53.887
I don't even know what.

41:54.012 --> 41:56.807
This man is without charm,
without character or charisma.

41:57.182 --> 42:00.268
-He has captured the
nation's imagination, Dietrich.

42:00.518 --> 42:03.063
And our churches are fuller
than have been in years.

42:03.188 --> 42:06.608
-But it's not about how many,
Bishop, it's about who.

42:07.067 --> 42:09.570
Don't you realize handing a man
this kind of crown

42:09.695 --> 42:11.322
will come with
a terrible price?

42:11.530 --> 42:12.698
-I can't agree.

42:13.990 --> 42:15.492
-Both for us...

42:15.783 --> 42:18.578
and those he so aggressively
targeting, the Jews.

42:18.703 --> 42:20.788
-Yeah. Surely Herr Hitler
will resolve

42:20.915 --> 42:21.915
the Jewish question too.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.543
-Why must there even be
a Jewish question?

42:27.755 --> 42:31.550
This is our national cathedral.

42:34.845 --> 42:36.138
-Dietrich,

42:36.263 --> 42:38.390
it has long been our policy

42:38.640 --> 42:41.435
that politics and the church
should not intersect.

42:41.560 --> 42:42.812
[audience claps in background]

42:42.937 --> 42:45.563
-Listen to that applause.

42:46.690 --> 42:48.233
They already have.

42:51.403 --> 42:53.072
-What if I speak
to Chancellor Hitler?

42:54.823 --> 42:56.950
We both fought
in the Great War.

42:57.702 --> 42:58.535
He might listen.

42:58.660 --> 43:00.703
-Then tell him the church
does not belong to him

43:00.828 --> 43:01.705
or any man.

43:01.830 --> 43:03.707
It belongs to the living God.

43:04.333 --> 43:07.085
-Not everything needs
to be a fight, Dietrich.

43:08.378 --> 43:11.132
Your heart is moving faster
than your mind.

43:11.257 --> 43:12.590
-Yes, speed matters.

43:13.008 --> 43:14.302
If no one warns
the German people,

43:14.427 --> 43:16.053
they might think
the entire clergy

43:16.178 --> 43:18.555
agrees with Bishop Müller
and his sycophants.

43:19.598 --> 43:21.767
I have the pulpit at
Kaiser Wilhelm in two weeks.

43:22.100 --> 43:22.977
At Jacobi's invitation.

43:23.102 --> 43:24.395
In fact, that might be
the perfect opportunity

43:24.520 --> 43:25.478
to speak up against...

43:25.603 --> 43:26.813
-Now, listen closely,
young friend.

43:26.938 --> 43:28.440
Everyone will be
paying attention.

43:28.607 --> 43:31.360
including this bishop that
still remains your superior.

43:32.402 --> 43:33.903
I advise you recall

43:34.028 --> 43:36.365
the words of the English writer
William Shakespeare.

43:37.490 --> 43:40.618
“Discretion is the
better part of valor.”

43:44.205 --> 43:47.960
-Yeah, I prefer the words
of a Jewish writer, Paul.

43:49.920 --> 43:53.173
'God has not given us
a spirit of fear.'

43:59.137 --> 44:01.015
-If you don't take
your fear from God,

44:01.140 --> 44:03.142
perhaps you should take it
from your bishop.

44:10.190 --> 44:11.525
[church bells ring]

44:23.162 --> 44:25.038
KARL: I never understood kites.

44:26.498 --> 44:28.458
All this effort and
they take you nowhere.

44:30.335 --> 44:34.798
DIETRICH: I think the idea is
they get you to look up.

44:34.965 --> 44:37.175
KARL: Oh. My optimistic son.

44:38.260 --> 44:40.928
Everything always
pointing to the sky.

44:42.848 --> 44:44.348
You realize I come
for these walks

44:44.475 --> 44:47.102
to take a break from
giving out advice, don't you?

44:47.853 --> 44:51.857
-I'm sorry.
I can figure it out myself.

44:52.398 --> 44:53.983
-I'm sure you already have.

44:54.610 --> 44:57.863
-I guess I'm just
seeking permission to be brave.

45:02.325 --> 45:06.330
-You don't need
anyone's permission, son.

45:07.163 --> 45:08.498
You already are.

45:13.212 --> 45:14.212
-Thank you.

45:15.755 --> 45:18.633
KARL: Don't thank me
until after.

45:18.758 --> 45:19.718
DIETRICH: After?

45:20.635 --> 45:23.263
KARL: After whatever is
requiring all this courage

45:23.388 --> 45:24.473
in the first place.

45:44.577 --> 45:47.245
[ominous music]

45:58.590 --> 46:00.717
-They won't eat you, Dietrich.

46:00.842 --> 46:03.387
At least not until
after the sermon.

46:11.895 --> 46:15.148
[dramatic music]

46:46.472 --> 46:49.850
-“Woe to you, hypocrites,

46:51.185 --> 46:55.522
You white-washed tombs,

46:56.982 --> 47:00.027
outwardly beautiful,

47:01.320 --> 47:04.573
inwardly full of
dead man's bones.”

47:04.698 --> 47:08.868
“You serpents, you vipers.

47:10.162 --> 47:13.415
How can you escape damnation?”

47:16.377 --> 47:21.005
These violent words
are not my own.

47:21.798 --> 47:27.220
They come from the mouth
of our Lord.

47:28.972 --> 47:35.770
And His harshest words
were not for sinners

47:37.147 --> 47:39.567
but always reserved

47:41.025 --> 47:42.652
for the “religious”.

47:44.153 --> 47:47.032
Because there has never been
anyone in history

47:48.033 --> 47:52.245
who hated religion
more than Jesus Christ.

47:53.830 --> 47:57.292
He never wanted our religion.

47:58.335 --> 48:00.378
All he ever wanted...

48:02.213 --> 48:03.465
was us.

48:05.133 --> 48:09.512
Our full selves.

48:11.932 --> 48:15.893
But we, the German church,

48:17.187 --> 48:21.817
are on the verge of
giving ourselves to another.

48:23.193 --> 48:28.448
Of choosing full pews
over full hearts.

48:29.825 --> 48:34.412
The church should be
a place of refuge,

48:34.913 --> 48:36.582
a place of sanctuary,

48:37.123 --> 48:39.083
not a place of power.

48:41.085 --> 48:46.300
The German church
must stand on God's word alone.

48:47.258 --> 48:49.343
Not any man's word,

48:49.970 --> 48:55.225
and especially
not a Führer's word.

48:57.893 --> 49:00.313
[dramatic music intensifies]

49:09.447 --> 49:11.115
DIETRICH: Turn with
me in scripture

49:11.240 --> 49:13.410
to Matthew chapter five.

49:20.208 --> 49:22.710
-It's been a long time
since I've heard truth

49:22.877 --> 49:24.295
preached from their pulpit.

49:24.628 --> 49:25.630
Thank you.

49:26.255 --> 49:28.050
-I wish you were preaching
every Sunday.

49:28.175 --> 49:30.135
Might actually get my Otto
back to church.

49:30.260 --> 49:32.220
-What a privilege
to be with you all.

49:33.305 --> 49:36.392
-Oh, yes, it was a privilege.
One squandered.

49:36.517 --> 49:38.602
But now you have
people's attention, Dietrich.

49:39.310 --> 49:41.397
Perhaps that's everything
you've ever wanted.

49:44.648 --> 49:45.358
-I'm sorry if...

49:45.483 --> 49:47.860
-The truth doesn't
apologize for being true.

49:49.947 --> 49:52.240
The truth also separates
marrow from bone.

49:52.907 --> 49:55.410
You are on the other side
of those words now, Dietrich.

49:56.787 --> 49:57.537
Beware,

49:57.662 --> 50:00.082
you're not standing on the same
ground you were yesterday.

50:04.543 --> 50:05.920
-I'm so proud.

50:06.755 --> 50:07.797
...just brilliant, brother.

50:07.922 --> 50:09.465
-Thank you.
-Brilliant.

50:09.590 --> 50:11.927
-Mother. Father.

50:13.387 --> 50:14.805
-Courage needed, Son.

50:16.347 --> 50:18.058
Courage shown.

50:19.142 --> 50:20.727
-You were wonderful, son.

50:20.977 --> 50:23.272
But it looked like you were
painting a target on your chest

50:23.397 --> 50:24.982
with every single sentence.

50:25.815 --> 50:27.692
-Better a target
than a swastika.

50:27.817 --> 50:29.903
-Why does there
have to be a target?

50:30.278 --> 50:32.197
There were not so many
in the church today.

50:32.322 --> 50:33.490
-A message like that,

50:34.573 --> 50:36.535
it's not the size of the crowd

50:37.368 --> 50:39.495
but who's been
paying attention.

50:41.748 --> 50:43.542
[crowd cheers]

50:50.423 --> 50:53.427
-For the members of the church
under Hitler, the Reichskirche,

50:53.552 --> 50:55.303
demand the immediate cessation

50:55.428 --> 50:57.472
of the publishing
and dissemination

50:57.597 --> 50:59.892
of the Jewish Bible in Germany.

51:00.017 --> 51:04.020
-Per order by the Führer!
Mein Führer!

51:07.773 --> 51:13.572
KRAUSE: The Christ of the new
German Bible will be Aryan,

51:14.488 --> 51:18.618
with no Jewish roots.
No Jewish weakness.

51:20.037 --> 51:24.332
The church must clear away
all crucifixes, Bibles

51:26.292 --> 51:27.793
and images of the saints,

51:28.920 --> 51:30.713
and replace them

51:31.172 --> 51:34.425
with our leader's
glorious words.

51:35.510 --> 51:40.015
And it must be superseded by
the only unconquerable symbol,

51:40.140 --> 51:41.600
the swastika!

51:41.850 --> 51:43.768
[crowd cheers]

51:48.732 --> 51:51.275
[Speaking in German]

51:51.943 --> 51:53.903
[men argue in background]

51:55.988 --> 51:57.865
[Speaking in German]

51:59.492 --> 52:01.202
[Speaking in German]

52:03.247 --> 52:04.163
Matthias?

52:04.288 --> 52:05.290
Matthias.

52:06.457 --> 52:07.458
Matthias.

52:08.668 --> 52:09.920
Matthias. Hey,

52:10.045 --> 52:11.420
you don't think I know it's you

52:11.547 --> 52:12.713
just because
you're playing dress-up?

52:12.838 --> 52:15.175
Rudolph, enough of
this Karneval.

52:15.300 --> 52:16.467
Boys, what is this?

52:16.593 --> 52:19.053

Wilhelm.

52:21.848 --> 52:23.933
Heinrich, look at me.

52:24.058 --> 52:24.893
This is madness!

This is not a joke
to be played.

Hey, I don't need
your hands on me, sir.

-They are children!

52:30.648 --> 52:31.775

The church youth are now
the Hitler Youth,

52:33.818 --> 52:34.903
as it should be.

52:37.113 --> 52:38.113
-Some problem here, Max?

52:38.823 --> 52:43.035

seems to have lost his flock.

53:06.225 --> 53:07.185
JACOBI: Dietrich, listen to me.

costumed as the Hitler Youth.

53:10.855 --> 53:12.648
I mean, how long until the
entire country is

53:12.773 --> 53:14.233

53:15.068 --> 53:17.820
So what can we do?
Because do something we must.

53:19.072 --> 53:20.407
-It's not what we can do.

53:30.208 --> 53:31.752
It's what you can do.

53:33.378 --> 53:35.255
Sit down, Herr Bonhoeffer.

53:43.095 --> 53:44.597
My every move is being watched

53:44.722 --> 53:47.183
since I gave you that Sunday
at Kaiser Wilhelm.

53:48.935 --> 53:50.687
We need someone young

53:50.937 --> 53:53.022
who has staked a claim
for the truth already.

53:53.147 --> 53:54.983
-No one's been interested
in speaking to me

53:55.108 --> 53:57.068

I opened my mouth.

53:57.568 --> 53:58.695
-You may not know it,
but your sermon

53:58.820 --> 54:00.363
not only angered the Nazis,

54:00.530 --> 54:03.032
it also galvanized a whole raft
of seminary students

54:03.617 --> 54:04.533
and made you
friends in places

54:04.658 --> 54:06.035

even go to church.

54:06.160 --> 54:07.495
-Good. Because more than

54:07.620 --> 54:09.288
the church's life
is on the line.

54:10.415 --> 54:14.627
This is a knife
to the heart of the nation.

than your words to this cause?

-I'm about to ask you
to save the German church.

54:44.698 --> 54:45.825
-To save it,

54:46.617 --> 54:48.495
we'll have to split it apart.

-You will go to England
as our spy.

he's already waiting.

is the church

55:34.707 --> 55:36.960

for the victims of the state?

simply not Jewish propaganda?

the yellow stars,

55:55.770 --> 55:57.355

55:58.482 --> 56:00.650
Hitler has carved them
out of society.

56:01.275 --> 56:05.655
Left them stateless,
unprotected.

56:06.488 --> 56:10.785
So look me in the eye
and call me propaganda.

56:13.162 --> 56:16.123
I have secreted myself
here to tell you

that the true German church
has no alternative

the false church of the Nazis,

56:23.005 --> 56:24.923

56:25.383 --> 56:28.135
We need to let the world know
what the Nazis are

56:28.260 --> 56:29.637
doing to the Jews.

56:30.722 --> 56:34.683
And if the church
does not speak now,

56:36.393 --> 56:38.480
we will lose our voice
for a hundred years.

and her church

How many will he

planning diplomacy.

is to kindle peace, peacefully.

-Oh, You mean silently.

56:55.205 --> 56:56.790
-If need be.

56:56.915 --> 57:01.878
-Our silence in the
face of evil is itself evil.

57:03.087 --> 57:05.757
Not to speak is to speak.

57:06.048 --> 57:08.258
Not to act is to act.

with Dietrich.

Hitler is a threat
to all humanity.

57:23.023 --> 57:24.608
-The church

57:26.443 --> 57:30.198
should be the first
to make that announcement.

57:30.490 --> 57:32.033
Not the last.

57:34.077 --> 57:36.913
BISHOP BELL: Now, Dietrich
is going to speak,

57:37.038 --> 57:38.707
and the scrivener
is going to write,

57:38.832 --> 57:41.918
and unless you have
anything to add,

57:42.252 --> 57:45.463
I suggest we all enter
a silent period.

We, the Confessing Church
in Germany,

reject the false doctrines
of the German Reich church.

58:07.777 --> 58:12.073
We declare that the church
does not belong to any man and

58:12.740 --> 58:15.618
that it is under the authority
of God alone.

not merely for its members,

58:18.287 --> 58:20.623
but more vitally,
for those who are not.”

58:23.835 --> 58:25.962

doesn't punish my Comices.

Clemmie.

harms and oppresses,

58:38.642 --> 58:40.768
and for Germany,
this means the Jews,

58:41.060 --> 58:44.105
then the church must stand
against the state,

58:44.730 --> 58:48.150
must put a stick
in the very wheel of the state

58:48.568 --> 58:50.110
until it stops.”

Bonhoeffer and his merry men

are too afraid to do.

arriving via Amsterdam.

to meet your flight
from Belfast.

safe for you, Herr Bonhoeffer.

Reichskirche.

But the Confessing Church, yes.

01:00:29.085 --> 01:00:31.045
And I have much to confess.

I had it
completely wrong, Dietrich.

Can you...

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:44.975
Can you find it in your heart
to forgive me?

-Bishop, of course.

-Come.

to face the dark.

-The church you tried to save

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:10.377
had become religion
without Christ.

01:01:12.753 --> 01:01:14.963
But what we need
is Christ without religion.

01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:23.932
You know,
my father used to say,

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:26.850
“When you board
the wrong train,

01:01:27.852 --> 01:01:29.187
there's no use
running down the aisle

01:01:29.312 --> 01:01:30.730
in the opposite direction.”

01:01:33.315 --> 01:01:34.317
-He's right.

01:01:35.693 --> 01:01:37.820

jump off the train

01:01:37.945 --> 01:01:39.488

in Dahlem every Sunday.

I can't hide.

01:02:41.967 --> 01:02:43.177
Or they will start looking
for me

01:02:43.302 --> 01:02:44.595
and discover all of this.

01:02:45.053 --> 01:02:46.555
DIETRICH: I'm a
young man myself.

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:50.308
What could I possibly teach
these students?

01:02:53.897 --> 01:02:55.188
-Teach them your heart.

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:58.317
-My heart?
-Yes.

01:03:00.945 --> 01:03:03.990
-My heart is broken.

01:03:06.742 --> 01:03:08.452
-Then teach them that.

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:15.710
See, this is not
a spiritual escape.

01:03:16.252 --> 01:03:17.795
This is a literal escape.

of Heinrich Schütz,

about to embark upon

01:36:40.587 --> 01:36:42.507
feels utterly alien,

01:36:43.173 --> 01:36:45.800
it also feels precisely
what you have called us to do.

01:36:49.053 --> 01:36:51.307
So guide our hands.

01:36:52.473 --> 01:36:54.685
Guide our trembling hands.

01:37:23.255 --> 01:37:24.257
DIETRICH: Frank.

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:27.885
FRANK: Finally got
you back home.

01:37:28.635 --> 01:37:30.095
Shall we drop the suitcase

01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:32.513
and take this town
like it needs to be taken?

01:37:33.390 --> 01:37:35.100
-I need to make a stop first.

01:37:36.643 --> 01:37:38.978
And I need your full attention.

01:37:39.103 --> 01:37:40.022
-Come.

01:38:01.710 --> 01:38:02.712
-Go on now.

01:38:04.422 --> 01:38:05.505
I didn't come to
hear you rehearse

01:38:05.630 --> 01:38:07.215

01:38:18.227 --> 01:38:19.603
-Nine years ago,

01:38:20.478 --> 01:38:24.983
I learned in this very building

01:38:26.110 --> 01:38:28.278
that faith without action

01:38:29.697 --> 01:38:31.198
is no faith at all.

01:38:31.323 --> 01:38:33.117
[suspenseful music]

01:38:53.387 --> 01:38:55.888
DIETRICH: And I've returned

01:38:57.223 --> 01:39:01.145
to tell you, and
anyone who will listen,

01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:05.482
that the time to rescue
the Jews of Europe,

01:39:05.773 --> 01:39:07.067
and to end the madness of a man

01:39:07.192 --> 01:39:10.362
who has dared
to call himself a god,

01:39:12.363 --> 01:39:13.365
is now.

01:39:33.135 --> 01:39:34.260
But how?

01:39:35.845 --> 01:39:39.933
How can we act when we face

01:39:40.058 --> 01:39:41.310
this kind of terror,

01:39:42.518 --> 01:39:43.853
this kind of despair?

01:40:17.595 --> 01:40:22.017
Because all our Savior
ever asked of Peter was...

01:40:23.810 --> 01:40:25.187
“follow Me.”

01:40:26.522 --> 01:40:27.688
Two words.

01:40:28.815 --> 01:40:33.112
But where does
Christ bid us follow?

01:40:34.738 --> 01:40:38.450
And can we set aside
all our plans

01:40:38.658 --> 01:40:39.827
and do as He says?

01:40:39.952 --> 01:40:44.330
Because when Christ
calls a man, He bids him,

01:40:47.125 --> 01:40:51.172
“Come and die.”

01:40:51.422 --> 01:40:53.298
RUDY: More than a thousand
Vickers machine guns

01:40:53.423 --> 01:40:54.925
captured from France.

01:40:55.050 --> 01:40:58.720
Every Hotchkiss M
that Belgium surrendered.

01:40:58.845 --> 01:41:03.975
And countless T-26 tanks
from the fall of Kharkov.

01:41:04.893 --> 01:41:08.605
These are your spoils
from more than a dozen countries

01:41:08.730 --> 01:41:11.400
brought to their knees
by your strength alone.

01:41:11.733 --> 01:41:15.195
-Europe is burning.

01:41:17.113 --> 01:41:19.575
In Kiev, Nazi
killing squads shot dead.

01:41:21.868 --> 01:41:25.663
33,000 Jews in two days.

01:41:27.665 --> 01:41:30.418
That's how far
the devil has gone.

01:41:30.543 --> 01:41:31.545
But...

01:41:38.093 --> 01:41:40.012
how far have you gone?

01:41:47.352 --> 01:41:50.855
-Most courage is wasted,

01:41:51.565 --> 01:41:53.150
Herr Gersdorff.

01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:01.032
Don't you agree?

01:42:31.313 --> 01:42:32.605
-All the way to the cross?

01:42:34.942 --> 01:42:39.572
Because beyond the cross
is the resurrected life.

01:42:41.113 --> 01:42:43.617
And that's the place
to which He calls each of us

01:42:43.825 --> 01:42:46.245
since before
the beginning of time.

01:42:46.370 --> 01:42:47.703
So...

01:42:51.375 --> 01:42:52.877
Will you follow me?

01:42:53.002 --> 01:42:54.210
[music intensifies]

01:43:37.503 --> 01:43:39.213
Will you follow Him...

01:43:44.385 --> 01:43:48.015
all the way to the cross?

01:43:51.225 --> 01:43:53.562
REV POWELL: All the way
to the cross. Right, Dietrich?

01:43:55.397 --> 01:43:57.815
-Yes, sir. Yes.

01:43:59.525 --> 01:44:00.777
-Only problem,

01:44:02.403 --> 01:44:05.823
Your cross
isn't in America yet.

01:44:06.617 --> 01:44:07.993
It's in Germany.

01:44:12.413 --> 01:44:16.835
I too remember understanding
what I was preaching

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:19.922
only the moment
the words left my mouth.

01:44:26.135 --> 01:44:29.513
DIETRICH: Reverend,
I'm not running away.

01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:32.433
I'm running towards.

01:44:37.688 --> 01:44:39.023
-That's fair enough.

01:44:51.953 --> 01:44:54.247
Towards what?

01:44:55.540 --> 01:44:57.125
And where...

01:45:01.253 --> 01:45:03.340
where is your finish line?

DIETRICH: Is this a clear line?

01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:22.733
-The only one left.

01:45:25.487 --> 01:45:26.488
-Hans...

01:45:28.407 --> 01:45:29.573
I'm coming home.

01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:31.368
-You can't.
I thought we decided--

01:45:31.493 --> 01:45:33.412
-God didn't agree
and neither do I.

01:45:38.583 --> 01:45:39.583
Is it done?

01:45:40.793 --> 01:45:41.920
-No.

01:45:43.088 --> 01:45:45.090
No. The fuze was lit,

01:45:45.215 --> 01:45:46.842
but Hitler sensed something.

01:45:46.967 --> 01:45:49.135
He was gone before
the work could be finished.

01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:51.137
-Gersdorff?
-Is alive.

01:45:51.262 --> 01:45:52.847
Somehow. A miracle.

01:45:53.473 --> 01:45:56.017
But we need help from England.
From Churchill.

01:45:56.852 --> 01:45:58.728
And there's no safe means
of reaching him.

01:45:58.853 --> 01:46:00.438
-Have you asked for help?
HANS: Yes.

01:46:00.563 --> 01:46:02.523
Another bomb, two if necessary.

01:46:03.317 --> 01:46:04.692
But our communications
are down.

01:46:05.277 --> 01:46:07.320
He may be standing by,
ready to light our fuze,

01:46:07.445 --> 01:46:08.822
but there is no way of knowing.

01:46:08.947 --> 01:46:12.992
-Now, listen,
my ship stops in London first.

01:46:13.118 --> 01:46:14.618
I know Bishop Bell
would help me.

01:46:15.287 --> 01:46:18.373
-I don't want you coming home
to be arrested or worse.

01:46:18.498 --> 01:46:19.875
-I want to.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.460

I'm coming home.

01:46:26.255 --> 01:46:28.550
-London is crawling
with Nazi spies.

01:46:29.092 --> 01:46:30.885
They're watching everywhere.

01:46:31.010 --> 01:46:32.053
-Good.

01:46:32.845 --> 01:46:34.305

England will listen.

the bomb you request.

-Churchill sees
Germany as a whole.

01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:06.523
to see the small threads
in the tapestry

01:48:06.648 --> 01:48:08.650

is Nazi brown.

the dark, my friend.

My country was
invaded from within!

Does Churchill know
what that feels like?

01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:37.262
And please don't tell me
you agree with him.

01:48:37.637 --> 01:48:39.055

give answers, my friend.

But He always gives Himself.

you won't stay?

than loud from our pulpits.

-I've learned,
finally, Bishop,

01:49:32.358 --> 01:49:37.155
that people don't hear
what is shouted from the pulpit

01:49:37.697 --> 01:49:40.325
as much as they hear what is
whispered in the street.

go with you, my son.

-To tell me Churchill
has turned his back?

01:50:00.012 --> 01:50:01.262
You could have
done that from London

01:50:01.387 --> 01:50:03.097

01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:14.093
and I've been
chased ever since.

01:56:14.218 --> 01:56:15.302
But now...

01:56:19.473 --> 01:56:24.145
I'm ready to meet my destiny.

01:56:26.813 --> 01:56:29.983
[somber music]

01:56:40.995 --> 01:56:44.415

I was a pastor.

01:56:48.962 --> 01:56:53.048
KOKORIN: Will you be
our pastor today?

01:56:53.173 --> 01:56:54.550
- I will.

01:56:56.635 --> 01:57:00.013
The Lord Jesus,
on the night he was betrayed,

01:57:00.138 --> 01:57:01.432
took bread,

01:57:02.267 --> 01:57:04.727
and when he had given thanks,

01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:09.357
he broke it and said,

01:57:10.900 --> 01:57:11.983
“This...

01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:15.195
is my body,

01:57:15.613 --> 01:57:17.407
which is broken...”

01:57:17.573 --> 01:57:18.867
<i>This is the body...</i>

01:57:19.075 --> 01:57:20.367
...for you.

01:57:20.493 --> 01:57:22.662
For our Lord Jesus Christ.

01:57:23.662 --> 01:57:27.625
'Do this for
the remembrance of me.'

01:57:31.087 --> 01:57:32.255
BEST: We can't allow...

01:57:32.380 --> 01:57:34.257
-It is not our table.

01:57:36.342 --> 01:57:37.885
It is the Lord's,

01:57:38.887 --> 01:57:40.847
And He has invited us all.

01:57:45.893 --> 01:57:47.978
Lift your head.

01:57:49.313 --> 01:57:52.775
This is the body of our Lord.

01:57:54.235 --> 01:57:58.405
'This is my blood,
spilled for you.

01:57:59.115 --> 01:58:04.162
Do this whenever you drink it

01:58:06.455 --> 01:58:10.000
for the remembrance of me.'

01:58:39.655 --> 01:58:41.490
[eerie music]

01:58:45.578 --> 01:58:48.957
DIETRICH: For me,
this is not the end...

01:58:49.082 --> 01:58:51.458
but the beginning of life.

01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:55.337
GESTAPO: Bonhoeffer,
to the gallows.

01:59:42.260 --> 01:59:45.763
DIETRICH: You will get these
to my mother.

01:59:46.513 --> 01:59:48.015
I know you will.

01:59:51.602 --> 01:59:56.065
Tell her I couldn't
find a strawberry,

01:59:58.692 --> 02:00:00.193
but my words did.

02:00:24.468 --> 02:00:28.097
[wind blowing]

02:00:40.442 --> 02:00:41.985
GESTAPO: Dietrich Bonhoeffer,

02:00:42.110 --> 02:00:43.820

DIETRICH: “Blessed are
they that mourn,

02:01:07.512 --> 02:01:09.430
for they shall be comforted.

02:01:11.723 --> 02:01:13.350
Blessed are the merciful,

02:01:15.102 --> 02:01:17.103
for they shall receive mercy.

02:01:19.565 --> 02:01:21.025
Blessed...

02:01:22.233 --> 02:01:24.070
are the pure in heart,

02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:27.823
For they shall see...

God.”
