No, it's our meat grinder.

00:35.519 --> 00:36.684

That's the one.

01:10.979 --> 01:12.237
Oh, that show
where the contestants are

01:12.389 --> 01:13.630
on an island and they have to do

01:13.649 --> 01:15.574
all sorts of obstacles
and challenges?

01:15.725 --> 01:16.742
But the hardest challenge is

01:16.893 --> 01:18.485
figuring out where to poop,
I assume.

01:18.637 --> 01:20.913
-Yup.
-And the winner of the show gets
a million dollars.

01:21.064 --> 01:22.915
Aunt Gayle, you could win
a million dollars.

01:23.066 --> 01:25.900

Just as soon as they pick me.

01:25.994 --> 01:26.734

I've already been cast
on the show.

01:38.674 --> 01:39.673

Uh-huh, uh-huh.

01:42.103 --> 01:44.010
Isn't that gonna be
maybe a little hard since they--

01:44.163 --> 01:45.938

who look, um, muscle-y?

01:46.089 --> 01:48.014

two-armed pull-ups.

-Anyway, that's why
I'm here, Linda.

-Seems doable.
-I don't have it all worked out,

02:10.706 --> 02:14.708

I'm gonna rip off my shirt

02:14.802 --> 02:18.637
and right here on my upper belly
it'll say "Cast Gayle."

02:18.864 --> 02:21.306
Which I would need to re-do
for the actual tape

02:21.458 --> 02:23.200
because I wrote it upside down.

02:23.218 --> 02:24.384

W-wait, hang on.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.218
Y-You seem a little ragey.

14:47.370 --> 14:49.387
-I am not ragey!
-No, right.

14:49.464 --> 14:51.280
Uh, it's just that
when you're like this--

14:51.299 --> 14:52.724
not ragey at all--
but, you know,

14:52.893 --> 14:55.709
you don't always drive
as well as you normally do.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.711
Move it, Slowbodon Milosovic!

14:57.731 --> 14:59.063
Yeah, you can drive.

14:59.215 --> 15:01.807
[Gayle] Well, I haven't
climbed it in years,

15:01.960 --> 15:03.309
but it'll come back, right?

15:03.461 --> 15:04.977
Just like climbing a bridge.

15:05.130 --> 15:07.572
If anything, I've only gotten
stronger and hotter since then.

15:07.723 --> 15:10.742
And my bottom muscles
are off the charts lately.

15:10.893 --> 15:13.319
It sure is tall and leaning

15:13.413 --> 15:14.804
in a way that looks
hard to climb.

15:14.897 --> 15:17.582
She says she can do it
and she's got herself pumped up.

15:17.733 --> 15:19.066
I'm pumped up.
Are you pumped up?

15:19.085 --> 15:21.494
-Uh, I could "Gayle my day."
-That's the spirit.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.237
All right, I'm going.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.647
Ready when you are, tough stuff.

15:24.740 --> 15:26.758
Island. Oh.

15:26.909 --> 15:29.093
[grunting]

15:30.096 --> 15:31.763
We'll just put some music
over it.

15:31.914 --> 15:34.006
Go! Go, go, go, go!
Drive! Drive!

15:34.175 --> 15:36.159
-That's helpful, Lin, thanks.
[groans]

15:36.177 --> 15:38.252
We got to stop Gayle
before she gets hurt

15:38.271 --> 15:39.679
or makes a fool of herself
or both.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.681
I mean, do you really think
she might get hurt?

15:41.775 --> 15:44.500
I don't know. All I know
is that she's doing something

15:44.593 --> 15:46.778
that people our age
should not try to do.

15:46.929 --> 15:48.762
She's just--
she's got to accept it.

15:48.856 --> 15:50.782
We're old.
We're middle-aged ladies.

15:50.933 --> 15:52.341
We're not as strong
as we used to be.

15:52.435 --> 15:53.934
We're not shiny and new anymore.

15:54.012 --> 15:55.511
I accept it.
I mean, look at me.

15:55.530 --> 15:57.104
So I couldn't do a split
at the wedding--

15:57.123 --> 15:58.957
something I've been able to do
since I was a kid--

15:59.184 --> 16:00.441
so what?!
I'm fine with it!

16:00.535 --> 16:03.202
Uh-huh. Yup. I mean,
you-you almost did a split.

16:03.354 --> 16:04.278
You were more down than up.

16:04.372 --> 16:06.022
I'm not talking about me, Bob.

16:06.082 --> 16:08.800
I'm talking about Gayle.
This is about Gayle!

16:08.951 --> 16:10.376
Right, I know.
Obviously. Yeah.

16:10.453 --> 16:11.544
-I kno-- Yeah.
-Look out for the duck!

16:11.638 --> 16:13.096
-[screams]
-[duck quacks]

16:17.368 --> 16:18.718
How am I doing--
almost at the top?

16:18.870 --> 16:19.885
[Gene] Top-ish?

16:20.054 --> 16:22.038
Uh, you still have
most of the bridge to go.

16:22.056 --> 16:23.723
You don't have to keep asking
every few seconds.

16:23.875 --> 16:26.467
-You'll know.
-'Cause you'll run
out of bridge?

16:26.486 --> 16:27.560
[grunting]

16:27.654 --> 16:28.878
[Louise]
Oh, crap. And, uh,

16:28.896 --> 16:30.471
maybe pick up the pace, Gayle.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.398
-[car doors open, close]
-A little bit. Huh? no reason.

16:32.567 --> 16:34.475
Cut! Cut!

16:34.643 --> 16:36.143
Hi, Linda. Hi, Bob.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.737
Bob, you look nice and clean.

16:37.889 --> 16:39.313
Hi, Gayle. Thank you?

16:39.407 --> 16:40.647
Oh, hey, Mom.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.575
Whoa, wait, when did
that drawbridge get here?

16:42.727 --> 16:45.061
And how did Gayle get on it?
[weak chuckle]

16:45.230 --> 16:46.562
This is crazy.

16:46.581 --> 16:49.248
Why are we cutting?
Is it 'cause of all my farting?

16:49.400 --> 16:50.566
I thought they were silent.

16:50.585 --> 16:52.010
Hang on, Gayle.
I got to yell at the kids

16:52.161 --> 16:53.511
about something for a second.

16:53.662 --> 16:56.072
Uh, are you gonna yell at us
about how much you love us?

16:56.090 --> 16:58.332
-[growling]
-Mm, mm-mmm. Mm-mm-mm.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.076
Do I just...
I'll keep climbing.

17:00.094 --> 17:01.853
Yup, keep up
that great momentum.

17:02.080 --> 17:05.081
[chuckles] Hello, Mother.
So, you seem upset.

17:05.099 --> 17:06.190
I know you had
some weird reservations

17:06.342 --> 17:07.616
about doing this, but--

17:07.618 --> 17:09.009
[whispering]
I am livid right now.

17:09.103 --> 17:10.936
For one thing,
I told you kids not to do this.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.938
And for another thing,
there are so many reasons

17:13.033 --> 17:15.441
Gayle should not be
doing this, any of this.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.610
Why not? I mean, yes,
it's a little dangerous, but

17:17.762 --> 17:19.929
I don't think it's, like, "break
all your bones" dangerous.

17:19.947 --> 17:22.523
Yeah, maybe like "I'm gonna feel
that in the morning" dangerous.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.876
Also, Mom, come on,
the tape we made is bad.

17:25.103 --> 17:27.378
This is how she gets on the show
and wins all the money

17:27.455 --> 17:29.622
and generously shares
50 to 65% of it with us.

17:29.774 --> 17:32.366
Kids, Aunt Gayle
is not gonna get on the show.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.035
Do you actually think Aunt
Gayle's gonna get on the show?

17:35.129 --> 17:37.613
-I mean... yeah.
-[Gene and Tina] Yeah.

17:37.706 --> 17:39.706
Aunt Gayle's tough.
She's scrappy as hell.

17:39.801 --> 17:41.467
She's a firecracker.
I think she gets it from me.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.786
[Gene]
I wouldn't want
to go up against her.

17:43.879 --> 17:45.304
I feel like
she's the kind of person

17:45.381 --> 17:46.789
who would bite your nose off
if she had to.

17:46.882 --> 17:48.215
Throw your ding-a-ling
in a river.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.475
She doesn't have gym strength,

17:49.627 --> 17:50.960
but she's got that
inner demon strength

17:50.978 --> 17:52.144
that you do not
want to mess with.

17:52.297 --> 17:53.387
I mean, Mom, look at her.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.797
She's doing it,
she's climbing up

17:54.890 --> 17:56.465
a 30-foot bridge
that's at an angle.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.076
That's how I want to be
when I'm middle-aged.

17:58.303 --> 17:59.243
Me too.

17:59.395 --> 18:00.578
Maybe with a little less
of my underwear

18:00.729 --> 18:02.305
sticking out of
the top of my shorts, though.

18:02.323 --> 18:04.974
And bottom, too, somehow.
But still.

18:05.067 --> 18:05.917
She is doing it.

18:06.068 --> 18:08.735
I mean, so, so slowly,
but, yeah.

18:08.830 --> 18:09.995
Wait, what were
the other reasons

18:10.148 --> 18:11.647
you didn't think
Gayle should do this?

18:11.740 --> 18:14.926
Oh, uh... I think, actually,

18:15.077 --> 18:16.836
you guys were right,
she's got this.

18:16.988 --> 18:19.488
Looking good, Gayle!
Keep going!

18:19.582 --> 18:20.339
That's what I'm doing.

18:20.491 --> 18:22.007
I'm just saying, looking good!

18:22.102 --> 18:23.159
Looking strong!

18:23.161 --> 18:24.493
Not so much talking, please!

18:24.587 --> 18:26.512
Yup. Yup. Sorry!
I'm so proud of you.

18:26.664 --> 18:28.497
-You're an inspiration.
-Still talking.

18:28.591 --> 18:30.833
-Still distracting.
-[whispers] Sorry.

18:30.926 --> 18:32.735
Thank you! [straining]

18:34.763 --> 18:36.280
Whoa, whoa.

18:36.507 --> 18:37.782
[grunts]

18:37.933 --> 18:40.009
Aah!

18:40.027 --> 18:42.528
Cast me!

18:42.680 --> 18:44.180
[Linda gasps]

18:44.273 --> 18:46.582
-[Gayle] Oh!
-[all cheering]

18:48.686 --> 18:49.852
[Linda] And cut.

18:49.871 --> 18:51.629
[Bob]
<i> Look, this electric grinder</i>

18:51.798 --> 18:54.690
is amazing. And, sure,
it saves me a lot of time.

18:54.709 --> 18:56.909
Too much time, maybe.
I don't have a lot of hobbies.

18:57.061 --> 19:00.138
A-Anyway, I thought it was the
same end product but quicker,

19:00.289 --> 19:02.122
but I don't know
if it is, exactly.

19:02.142 --> 19:04.066
I think they taste
a little different,

19:04.126 --> 19:05.551
and I think I know
what the difference was.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.479
With the old hand grinder, yeah,
it was hard to crank it,

19:08.631 --> 19:11.390
and it'd fight me
and sometimes I'd swear at it,

19:11.542 --> 19:15.044
but the meat wound up having
a little bit more texture,

19:15.137 --> 19:16.821
you know what I mean?
More complexity.

19:17.048 --> 19:19.231
More like it had
been through something.

19:19.384 --> 19:21.400
I mean, it had been through
a grinder, obviously,

19:21.494 --> 19:23.886
but, I don't know,
maybe it's all in my head.

19:23.979 --> 19:26.998
I-I g-I guess I just,
I miss that grind.

19:27.149 --> 19:28.499
I-I need that grind.

19:28.726 --> 19:31.818
I mean, you know, it's kind of
a metaphor for life, really.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.079
We get... we get older
and it beats us up,

19:34.232 --> 19:37.175
but we also get more textured,
more complex, more...

19:37.251 --> 19:41.253
more beautifully ground up
into delicious burgers.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.121
So, you want to return it?

19:43.199 --> 19:44.573
Y-Yes. Please.

19:44.667 --> 19:47.351
-There's a restocking fee.
-Yup, yup, I figured. Okay.

19:47.503 --> 19:49.020

19:49.171 --> 19:50.188
