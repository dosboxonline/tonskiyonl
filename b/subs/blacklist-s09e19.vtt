Because in here or out there,
I'll be waiting.

30:42.173 --> 30:46.886
And it's only a matter of time
before you realize you need me.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.515
[ominous music playing]

30:54.853 --> 30:57.856
You know the most amazing part
about all this?

30:58.606 --> 31:02.360
I can't do a thing in here
that you don't want me to.

31:04.696 --> 31:05.530
[gun cocks]

31:08.616 --> 31:12.328
It would be sad, if it wasn't so pathetic.

31:13.079 --> 31:14.080
[gunshot]

31:17.917 --> 31:19.127
[body thuds]

31:24.173 --> 31:25.884
God, I thought he'd never shut up.

31:28.928 --> 31:29.762
Samar?

31:36.686 --> 31:39.272
[Aram grunting]

31:39.355 --> 31:44.152
-This is just another hallucination.
-Yes, and yet here I am.

31:45.445 --> 31:47.030
You look incredible.

31:47.113 --> 31:48.907
-You look like hell.
-Yeah.

31:49.866 --> 31:52.744
Well, it's, um, kind of been a rough day.

31:54.037 --> 31:56.122
Seems like it's been
a rough couple of years.

31:56.205 --> 32:00.710
If I knew all it took to see you again
was a medical-grade acid trip--

32:00.793 --> 32:02.378
You've been living a lie, Aram...

32:03.296 --> 32:05.465
and I couldn't sit back
and watch it any longer.

32:05.548 --> 32:06.382
What lie?

32:06.466 --> 32:09.135
The one you've been telling yourself
since I went into the water.

32:09.218 --> 32:13.681
The one you repeated when Liz died
and when Nick hijacked your code.

32:13.765 --> 32:17.060
The one convincing you that you'll fail
as leader of the task force.

32:17.143 --> 32:18.728
[grunts] I don't--

32:20.521 --> 32:23.650
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Yes. You do.

32:24.150 --> 32:25.652
And I need you to see it.

32:26.277 --> 32:28.488
The man in the mask had your face. Why?

32:28.571 --> 32:30.865
-Why did you leave?
-Aram, please, we don't have much time.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.242
I would've taken care of you.
Even if you forgot everything.

32:33.326 --> 32:35.036
I just wanted to be near you.

32:35.119 --> 32:37.538
Why did you
make yourself into a Blacklister?

32:37.622 --> 32:39.749
Because it's my fault. All of it.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.086
If I'd just gotten to you sooner,
you'd still be here with me,

32:43.169 --> 32:46.297
instead of wasting away
alone on some island.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.007
That was my choice, Aram.

32:48.091 --> 32:51.344
[sobs] I was supposed to protect you
and I failed.

32:52.720 --> 32:56.557
Just like I failed Liz and I failed Agnes

32:56.641 --> 32:59.102
and I failed Greylock, and--

33:00.645 --> 33:02.730
Just like I'm gonna fail the task force.

33:03.523 --> 33:07.026
That's what he wants you to believe.
That doesn't make it true.

33:07.110 --> 33:10.571
He wants you to believe
that if you were only stronger,

33:10.655 --> 33:12.448
or smarter, or more ruthless,

33:12.532 --> 33:15.535
that you could've stopped
everything from happening.

33:16.369 --> 33:21.708
But no one has that much control.
Not Cooper, not Reddington, not you.

33:25.086 --> 33:26.462
It wasn't your fault.

33:32.427 --> 33:33.261
Samar.

33:34.012 --> 33:34.846
Samar.

33:39.767 --> 33:44.022
The savior complex was more charming
when it wasn't completely homicidal.

33:44.105 --> 33:45.106
[Aram laughs weakly]

33:49.527 --> 33:50.361
Oh, God.

33:52.280 --> 33:56.617
You've always been enough.
It's about time that you see it.

34:02.665 --> 34:04.667
[pensive music playing]

34:12.967 --> 34:14.385
Welcome back, Aram.

34:26.481 --> 34:27.732
Where are you going?

34:28.441 --> 34:30.443
I thought I'd give you some space.

34:31.694 --> 34:34.238
You can always reach me
on the usual number.

34:35.698 --> 34:39.786
Oh, Raymond, I don't know
what you want me to say.

34:39.869 --> 34:41.329
You don't need to say anything.

34:42.413 --> 34:45.958
You warned me that if I continued down
this path, terrible things would happen.

34:46.042 --> 34:49.712
And they did. I knew they would.
They always have.

34:51.380 --> 34:53.925
I want so badly to be angry with you.

34:54.008 --> 34:55.676
[emotional music playing]

34:55.760 --> 35:00.264
I think you want me to be too,
but the truth is, I'm not.

35:02.308 --> 35:03.226
I'm just sad.

35:05.853 --> 35:06.771
Yes.

35:06.854 --> 35:07.980
[knocking on door]

35:09.941 --> 35:11.442
Vlad. Oh, Vlad.

35:13.778 --> 35:17.740
-Am I interrupting?
-No. Mierce, this is Vladimir Cvetko.

35:17.824 --> 35:19.826
Vlad, this is Weecha's sister, Mierce.

35:19.909 --> 35:21.786
[both speak in Spanish]

35:22.453 --> 35:24.539
Vlad, you have a plane waiting.

35:24.622 --> 35:26.791
The woman in the apartment,
was she Kate or not?

35:26.874 --> 35:30.503
[in English] No. After compensating
for the damage caused by the fire,

35:30.586 --> 35:34.340
I found that the samples
were a 50 percent match,

35:34.423 --> 35:37.802
which means the woman
in the apartment was not Mr. Kaplan,

35:37.885 --> 35:40.096
-it was--
-Her sister. Maureen.

35:40.179 --> 35:42.181
[pensive music playing]

35:43.474 --> 35:44.433
Thank you, Vlad.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.477
Thank you.

35:46.936 --> 35:48.229
[both speak in Spanish]

35:54.735 --> 35:55.903
[in English] Raymond...

35:56.988 --> 36:00.074
Go. Do what you will.

36:19.552 --> 36:21.220
So that's not normal?

36:22.013 --> 36:23.848
It's not uncommon for patients

36:23.931 --> 36:28.311
to encounter feelings of shame and grief,

36:28.394 --> 36:31.731
or even experience radical confrontations
with the self, but--

36:31.814 --> 36:32.648
Murder loops?

36:33.149 --> 36:35.193
Not something I've heard before.

36:35.276 --> 36:37.236
I'm not sure I'd put it in the brochure.

36:38.821 --> 36:39.780
How do you feel?

36:40.448 --> 36:41.824
[pensive music playing]

36:41.908 --> 36:43.993
I don't know. Um...

36:44.619 --> 36:45.786
It's like I was certain

36:45.870 --> 36:49.248
that it was just a matter of time
before everything fell apart,

36:49.332 --> 36:51.626
and so I fought
as hard as I could to stop it,

36:51.709 --> 36:53.044
even though I knew I couldn't,

36:53.127 --> 36:54.295
and now...

36:55.421 --> 36:57.882
for the first time that I can remember...

37:01.886 --> 37:03.846
I don't feel like I have to fight anymore.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.140
I'm glad, Aram.

37:07.391 --> 37:10.895
It's not uncommon to feel like
one has a new lease on life...

37:11.812 --> 37:14.565
-But?
-This treatment isn't a cure-all.

37:15.900 --> 37:16.984
Do you understand?

37:17.860 --> 37:21.072
I understand about as much
as anything that happened to me today.

37:21.656 --> 37:24.116
So, uh... 50 percent?

37:25.576 --> 37:26.410
Good enough.

37:32.583 --> 37:34.585
[pensive music playing]

37:36.963 --> 37:40.049
That night, before the explosion...

37:42.551 --> 37:44.470
I was wondering what I would do

37:44.553 --> 37:48.599
if all this really was Kate's doing.

37:49.850 --> 37:52.353
I remember knowing with absolute certainty

37:52.436 --> 37:55.773
that Elizabeth would have wanted me
to show her mercy.

37:59.735 --> 38:01.362
I can still hear her voice.

38:03.614 --> 38:04.448
Me too.

38:07.451 --> 38:11.580
Before the bomb went off,
I thought, maybe...

38:14.250 --> 38:16.585
I just might rise to the occasion.

38:18.796 --> 38:22.717
At least now we know Mr. Kaplan
wasn't responsible for Liz's death.

38:26.178 --> 38:28.306
You have something new on Mrs. Lacroix?

38:30.641 --> 38:32.059
A mystery, really.

38:34.061 --> 38:38.274
The assassin was paid via wire transfer
from an account at a Lebanese bank.

38:38.357 --> 38:41.902
Problem is, according to public records,
that bank has been closed for years.

38:41.986 --> 38:44.363
Trying to figure out
how the payment was made now,

38:44.447 --> 38:48.242
but so far we haven't been able to find
out anything about the account holder.

38:49.285 --> 38:50.411
You never will.

38:51.704 --> 38:53.831
That account is part
of a financial network

38:53.914 --> 38:56.000
more secure than any other bank on earth.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.795
That's why I opened the account
in the first place.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.547
[dramatic music playing]

39:01.630 --> 39:06.052
The payment for Mrs. Lacroix's assassin,
it came from your account?

39:06.135 --> 39:06.969
It did.

39:09.805 --> 39:12.641
Our enemy is closer
than I ever imagined, Harold.

39:14.685 --> 39:17.271
[gentle pensive music playing]

39:34.288 --> 39:37.041
-How was your appointment?
-Oh, it was...

39:39.668 --> 39:42.171
You weren't in a fender bender
this morning, were you?

39:42.254 --> 39:45.007
No. Why?

39:45.591 --> 39:46.425
No reason.

39:47.259 --> 39:50.679
Uh, look, before we get started,
I need you to do me a favor.

39:50.763 --> 39:54.600
This is gonna sound strange,
but I need you to slap me. Hard.

39:54.683 --> 39:56.644
I know that's a weird-- Ow. Okay.

39:56.727 --> 39:57.978
[Aram clears throat]

39:58.771 --> 39:59.855
Thank you.

40:00.481 --> 40:01.774
Happy to help.

40:09.281 --> 40:11.992
Ever since I got back,
I've been wondering, why now?

40:12.576 --> 40:15.955
I've been feeling guilty about Samar,
about Liz for years,

40:16.038 --> 40:18.916
and what happened with Nick
and Greylock was awful, but...

40:20.292 --> 40:23.629
why did I choose that moment
to totally fall off a cliff?

40:24.213 --> 40:28.843
I'm not sure you chose anything,
but I'm curious if you have any ideas.

40:29.635 --> 40:33.431
Well, I can't be sure,
but I actually think it's all your fault.

40:33.514 --> 40:34.890
[chuckles]

40:34.974 --> 40:37.601
With you in charge,
I always had someone to rely on,

40:37.685 --> 40:41.230
to make the hard calls,
take the blame if things went wrong.

40:42.189 --> 40:46.527
I knew I wasn't ready, but I was hoping
I'd handle it a little better.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.571
You're handling it fine.

40:48.654 --> 40:52.283
I've been so anxious and depressed,
I took an experimental hallucinogen.

40:53.159 --> 40:55.411
You got help.
And I'm proud of you for that.

40:56.620 --> 40:59.957
This place is a crucible.
Of course you were overwhelmed.

41:00.040 --> 41:02.418
You remember you were kidnapped
about a month ago, right?

41:03.461 --> 41:06.839
This job demands that
you recognize the things you can control,

41:06.922 --> 41:08.632
and the things you can't.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.718
You make the best choices you can...

41:11.594 --> 41:14.346
then you find a way to forgive yourself
so you can move forward.

41:14.930 --> 41:18.350
-That sounds completely impossible.
-[chuckles] I know.

41:20.519 --> 41:23.272
But you'll learn,
and I'll have your back while you do.

41:25.399 --> 41:26.233
We all will.

41:34.617 --> 41:36.619
[pensive music playing]

42:21.372 --> 42:23.374
[dramatic music playing]
