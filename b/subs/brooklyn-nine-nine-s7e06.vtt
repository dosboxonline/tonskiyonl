WEBVTT

00:03.796 --> 00:05.464
Thanks, everybody,

00:03.796 --> 00:05.464
for coming out

00:05.506 --> 00:06.799
to Hitchcock's

00:05.506 --> 00:06.799
divorce party.

00:06.841 --> 00:07.967
Why is the cake

00:06.841 --> 00:07.967
two men getting married?

00:08.008 --> 00:09.384
[Scully]

00:08.008 --> 00:09.384
That's me and Hitchcock.

00:09.426 --> 00:10.469
The boys are back together!

00:10.511 --> 00:11.595
This cake

00:10.511 --> 00:11.595
is for a gay wedding.

00:11.637 --> 00:13.263
-The inside is a rainbow.

00:11.637 --> 00:13.263
-Nuh-uh.

00:13.305 --> 00:15.098
It's my favorite flavor:

00:13.305 --> 00:15.098
all the flavors.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.142
[Hitchcock]

00:15.140 --> 00:17.142
I can't believe Bethany's gone.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.393
It was so out

00:17.184 --> 00:18.393
of the blue.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.103
Well, not entirely.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.103
I mean she did

00:20.145 --> 00:21.856
have an affair

00:20.145 --> 00:21.856
with her hairdresser,

00:21.897 --> 00:23.482
and you filmed it and

00:21.897 --> 00:23.482
threatened to release the tape,

00:23.524 --> 00:24.817
and then she said

00:23.524 --> 00:24.817
she didn't care

00:24.859 --> 00:26.109
and put it on the

00:24.859 --> 00:26.109
Internet herself,

00:26.151 --> 00:27.402
and then when it

00:26.151 --> 00:27.402
started to make money,

00:27.444 --> 00:28.612
you sued her

00:27.444 --> 00:28.612
for half the profits.

00:28.654 --> 00:29.697
And then boom,

00:28.654 --> 00:29.697
out of the blue:

00:29.738 --> 00:30.865
divorce papers.

00:30.906 --> 00:32.073
[Hitchcock]

00:30.906 --> 00:32.073
Aw, buddy, you'll be OK.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.659
It doesn't feel like it.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.494
My heart is ruined forever.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.787
I'm done with love!

00:36.829 --> 00:38.205
I'll never find anyone as--

00:38.246 --> 00:41.082
Oh, my God!

00:38.246 --> 00:41.082
Get a load of the can on her!

00:41.124 --> 00:43.084
See ya, dorks.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.084
I'm gonna get some.

00:43.126 --> 00:45.963
Well, Hitchcock still sucks.

00:46.005 --> 00:49.925
[theme song playing]

01:05.941 --> 01:07.150
[Amy]

01:05.941 --> 01:07.150
Hey,

01:07.192 --> 01:09.611
did you get my

01:07.192 --> 01:09.611
sexy calendar invite?

01:09.653 --> 01:12.656
You mean the one titled

01:09.653 --> 01:12.656
"8:00 pm coitus"?

01:12.698 --> 01:14.825
Yes, and the one

01:12.698 --> 01:14.825
titled "7:55 foreplay."

01:14.867 --> 01:16.410
You didn't accept

01:14.867 --> 01:16.410
either invite.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.871
Oh, I can start

01:16.451 --> 01:18.871
foreplay later.

01:18.913 --> 01:20.873
No, no, no.

01:18.913 --> 01:20.873
I love foreplay, as you know.

01:20.915 --> 01:22.082
It's just,

01:20.915 --> 01:22.082
this is all feeling

01:22.123 --> 01:23.792
a little over-scheduled,

01:22.123 --> 01:23.792
you know?

01:23.834 --> 01:26.628
It might be taking

01:23.834 --> 01:26.628
some of the fun out of

01:23.834 --> 01:26.628
making a baby.

01:26.670 --> 01:27.922
Oh, OK.

01:27.963 --> 01:30.215
Um, so what are you suggesting?

01:30.257 --> 01:31.967
Maybe we try this...

01:30.257 --> 01:31.967
The Jake Way.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.761
Eating dinner

01:32.009 --> 01:33.761
starting with dessert?

01:33.802 --> 01:35.220
Well, that's one Jake Way.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.220
You know?

01:35.262 --> 01:36.346
The Jake Way is a brand.

01:36.388 --> 01:37.556
It encompasses

01:36.388 --> 01:37.556
a whole lifestyle.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.474
So get ready,

01:37.598 --> 01:39.474
because this month,

01:39.516 --> 01:41.643
we're makin' a baby

01:39.516 --> 01:41.643
The Jake Way.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.520
OK, I'm in.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.520
Sounds fun.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.480
So, are we doing it tonight,

01:43.562 --> 01:45.480
or...?

01:45.522 --> 01:46.774
Oh, no, no, no.

01:45.522 --> 01:46.774
The Jake Way

01:46.815 --> 01:48.400
does not believe

01:46.815 --> 01:48.400
in scheduling.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.651
You gotta just let go.

01:49.693 --> 01:51.278
You don't know

01:49.693 --> 01:51.278
what The Jake Way is.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.529
Nope, but we've got

01:51.319 --> 01:52.529
a name for it,

01:52.571 --> 01:53.655
and that's a great start.

01:53.697 --> 01:54.949
The Jake Way!

01:54.990 --> 01:56.324
[Holt]

01:54.990 --> 01:56.324
Lieutenant, as you know,

01:56.366 --> 01:57.993
I've been walking

01:56.366 --> 01:57.993
the same beat

01:58.035 --> 01:59.119
for the past

01:58.035 --> 01:59.119
three weeks.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.829
It's become

01:59.160 --> 02:00.829
a bit... tedious.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.330
I thought you

02:00.871 --> 02:02.330
loved tedium.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.041
I love monotony.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.041
They're very different.

02:04.083 --> 02:06.001
I'm sorry, but you

02:04.083 --> 02:06.001
know our policy

02:06.043 --> 02:07.544
is that uniformed officers

02:06.043 --> 02:07.544
must walk

02:07.586 --> 02:09.337
the same beat

02:07.586 --> 02:09.337
for six months.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.882
It's how they become familiar

02:09.379 --> 02:11.882
with the community they serve.

02:11.924 --> 02:13.174
Well, surely you can

02:11.924 --> 02:13.174
make an exception for me.

02:13.216 --> 02:14.342
I can't play favorites.

02:14.384 --> 02:15.636
You never did when

02:14.384 --> 02:15.636
you were in charge.

02:15.677 --> 02:16.929
-Of course I did.

02:15.677 --> 02:16.929
-Really?

02:16.971 --> 02:18.221
I never got any

02:16.971 --> 02:18.221
special treatment.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.848
I think you can

02:18.263 --> 02:19.848
do the math here.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.433
Damn.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.768
Well, think of

02:21.475 --> 02:22.768
it this way:

02:22.810 --> 02:24.603
It's like doing

02:22.810 --> 02:24.603
reps at a gym.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.063
Doing something

02:24.645 --> 02:26.063
over and over again

02:26.105 --> 02:27.606
is how you make

02:26.105 --> 02:27.606
your pecs pop.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.858
The only muscle

02:27.648 --> 02:29.858
I care to work out

02:27.648 --> 02:29.858
is my brain.

02:29.900 --> 02:32.611
Then get those reps in

02:29.900 --> 02:32.611
and make your brain pop.

02:32.653 --> 02:33.988
Pop, pop.

02:32.653 --> 02:33.988
Pop, pop, pop.

02:34.029 --> 02:36.156
What you're describing

02:34.029 --> 02:36.156
is an aneurysm.

02:36.197 --> 02:38.158
Pop, pop.

02:36.197 --> 02:38.158
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop!

02:38.199 --> 02:40.327
It's official!

02:38.199 --> 02:40.327
I'm in love.

02:40.368 --> 02:42.830
I just spent the night

02:40.368 --> 02:42.830
with the woman of my dreams.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.456
The lady from

02:42.871 --> 02:44.456
your divorce party?

02:44.498 --> 02:45.624
Yeah.

02:44.498 --> 02:45.624
She's my soulmate.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.959
She's funny.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.959
She's beautiful.

02:47.001 --> 02:49.210
-She has almost no scars.

02:47.001 --> 02:49.210
-Hot biscuits!

02:49.252 --> 02:51.630
It sounds like

02:49.252 --> 02:51.630
you hooked a live one.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.090
I know; we walked

02:51.672 --> 02:53.090
along the river for hours,

02:53.132 --> 02:54.424
just talking and laughing.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.718
She even gave me

02:54.466 --> 02:56.718
her real number.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.804
-Really?

02:56.760 --> 02:58.804
-Check it out.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.889
That's just a dirty

02:58.846 --> 03:00.889
old napkin covered in sauce.

03:00.931 --> 03:03.308
Oh, no. Her number!

03:00.931 --> 03:03.308
It's totally ruined.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.226
I knew I shouldn't have

03:03.350 --> 03:05.226
had those breakfast wings.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.812
Oh, bud, I'm so sorry.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.939
Now all I have to

03:06.854 --> 03:08.939
remember her by

03:06.854 --> 03:08.939
is this tooth.

03:08.981 --> 03:10.649
What the hell?

03:08.981 --> 03:10.649
Why do you have that?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.609
We were eating pizza,

03:10.691 --> 03:12.609
and it fell out of her mouth.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.528
Well, this is perfect.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.528
We can use it to find her.

03:14.569 --> 03:15.779
-What do you mean?

03:14.569 --> 03:15.779
-We just have to

03:15.821 --> 03:17.489
try fitting that tooth

03:15.821 --> 03:17.489
into the mouth

03:17.531 --> 03:19.324
of every woman

03:17.531 --> 03:19.324
in New York City

03:19.366 --> 03:21.869
till we find

03:19.366 --> 03:21.869
the matching gum hole

03:19.366 --> 03:21.869
of your one true love.

03:22.953 --> 03:25.914
My life is like a fairytale!

03:25.956 --> 03:27.749
So, Lieutenant,

03:25.956 --> 03:27.749
sorry to take up your time.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.960
I just wanted to go over

03:27.791 --> 03:29.960
the CompStat numbers

03:27.791 --> 03:29.960
real quick?

03:30.002 --> 03:32.921
-Um, what the--

03:30.002 --> 03:32.921
-Is something wrong?

03:32.963 --> 03:34.464
Are the CompStat

03:32.963 --> 03:34.464
numbers bad?

03:36.383 --> 03:38.552
The numbers are fine and...

03:36.383 --> 03:38.552
I have to go.

03:38.593 --> 03:39.803
[Terry]

03:38.593 --> 03:39.803
Oh, OK.

03:39.845 --> 03:40.804
Then why'd you

03:39.845 --> 03:40.804
ask for this meeting?

03:40.846 --> 03:42.347
Don't follow me, Terry.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.724
What?

03:42.389 --> 03:43.724
I wasn't going to!

03:43.765 --> 03:45.976
This was a very

03:43.765 --> 03:45.976
confusing interaction!

03:46.018 --> 03:47.769
-[phone buzzing]

03:46.018 --> 03:47.769
-Ooh.

03:47.811 --> 03:50.898
-Hello?

03:47.811 --> 03:50.898
-[Jake whispering]<i> Hello,</i>

03:58.072 --> 04:00.032
<i>Oh, this isn't Jake.</i>

03:58.072 --> 04:00.032
<i>This is the Syndicate.</i>

04:00.074 --> 04:02.242
<i>And you will never see us,</i>

04:00.074 --> 04:02.242

04:03.827 --> 04:05.704
Look away! Look away!

04:05.746 --> 04:07.664
-OK.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.664
<i>-Yes, that's better.</i>

04:07.706 --> 04:09.917
<i>On top of the copier,</i>

04:07.706 --> 04:09.917
<i>there's a headset.</i>

04:09.958 --> 04:12.377
<i>Put it on and get in the limo</i>

04:09.958 --> 04:12.377
<i>that's waiting out front.</i>

04:12.419 --> 04:13.712
Mm, OK, I love you.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.338
I love you too.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.338
Now go!

04:18.299 --> 04:20.427
-Are you Amy?

04:18.299 --> 04:20.427
-[Jake]<i> Tell him "yes."</i>

04:20.468 --> 04:22.179
-Yes.

04:22.221 --> 04:23.680
<i>played like a puppet?</i>

04:23.722 --> 04:26.934
OK, I'm walking

04:23.722 --> 04:26.934
into the apartment.

04:26.975 --> 04:30.187
Why did you have me

04:26.975 --> 04:30.187
get $400 out of the ATM?

04:30.229 --> 04:32.773
<i>Good question.</i>

04:30.229 --> 04:32.773
<i>It's to pay for the Airbnb.</i>

04:32.814 --> 04:34.566
You're giving them

04:32.814 --> 04:34.566
$400 in cash?

04:34.608 --> 04:37.277
<i>I broke several lamps while</i>

04:34.608 --> 04:37.277
<i>trying to hide in the dark.</i>

04:37.318 --> 04:38.862
<i>Now turn on the lights.</i>

04:38.904 --> 04:40.321
OK.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.074
Hello... it's me.

04:42.116 --> 04:43.200
Put down the drinks.

04:43.242 --> 04:44.785
-Why?

04:43.242 --> 04:44.785
-Are you upset?

04:44.826 --> 04:46.245
Yeah, and now I have to

04:44.826 --> 04:46.245
take The Syndicate down.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.621
Oh, my goodness.

Also, no more video games,

Well, it's hard.

all to ourselves,

11:41.326 --> 11:43.286

11:51.378 --> 11:52.962
is your brain OK?

11:53.004 --> 11:54.713
The point is:

11:53.004 --> 11:54.713
I don't care.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.757
Also, Anna's family's

11:54.755 --> 11:56.757
from the old country

11:56.799 --> 11:59.010
and kind of conservative,

11:56.799 --> 11:59.010
so try not to mention

11:56.799 --> 11:59.010
the baby to them.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.803
Perfect; I'll just do

11:59.052 --> 12:00.803
what I always do at weddings:

12:00.845 --> 12:02.805
not talk to anyone

12:00.845 --> 12:02.805
I don't know already.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.098
You're the best, Jake.

That's why you're

12:04.140 --> 12:05.766

12:08.395 --> 12:10.271
they're pregnant and we're not.

12:10.313 --> 12:11.481
How did they do it?

12:11.523 --> 12:12.773
They got drunk

12:11.523 --> 12:12.773
and had sex

12:12.815 --> 12:14.150
in a public park

12:12.815 --> 12:14.150
next to a skunk.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.485
Hitchcock sent me

12:14.192 --> 12:15.485
a very long text

12:15.527 --> 12:16.735
with a lot of

12:15.527 --> 12:16.735
details in it.

12:16.777 --> 12:18.279
I think it was meant

12:16.777 --> 12:18.279
for Scully.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.947
Ohh. The world is

12:18.321 --> 12:19.947
officially upside down.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.033
Wait a minute.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.033
Maybe that's it!

12:22.075 --> 12:23.742
We tried getting pregnant

12:22.075 --> 12:23.742
the Jake Way,

12:23.784 --> 12:24.869
we tried the Amy Way;

12:24.911 --> 12:26.329
maybe it's time

12:24.911 --> 12:26.329
we tried it...

12:26.371 --> 12:27.788
The Hitchcock Way.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.332
What's the Hitchcock Way?

12:29.374 --> 12:32.210
In every situation, make

12:29.374 --> 12:32.210
the worst possible decision.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.504
OK. What the hell?

12:32.252 --> 12:34.504
Nothing else is working.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.005
Let's try it the

12:34.546 --> 12:36.005

12:36.047 --> 12:38.299
All right, so first move:

12:36.047 --> 12:38.299

12:38.341 --> 12:40.385

12:38.341 --> 12:40.385
Drink up.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.596
Uh, these are someone else's.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.596
There's lipstick on mine.

12:42.637 --> 12:43.846
Yeah, and there's

12:42.637 --> 12:43.846
a cigarette in mine.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.265
But we're doing it

12:43.888 --> 12:45.265
the Hitchcock Way,

12:45.306 --> 12:46.683
-so bottoms up!

12:45.306 --> 12:46.683
-All right.

12:46.725 --> 12:49.686
Uh, for those of you

12:46.725 --> 12:49.686
that don't know me,

12:49.728 --> 12:51.938
my name is, uh, Norm Scully.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.189
Hitchcock is my partner,

12:53.231 --> 12:54.941
and he's also my best friend.

12:54.982 --> 12:56.901
He buys the bear claws I like

12:54.982 --> 12:56.901
when we're on a stakeout

12:56.943 --> 13:00.154
or when we're just

12:56.943 --> 13:00.154
in the office or at home.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.155
I love him.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.286
Michael Hitchcock as

13:04.367 --> 13:06.286

I do.

[Scully]

13:07.579 --> 13:08.663
And, Michael Hitchcock,

13:08.705 --> 13:10.290
do you agree

13:08.705 --> 13:10.290
to shower Anna

13:10.331 --> 13:12.166
with the same love

13:10.331 --> 13:12.166
and kindness

13:10.331 --> 13:12.166
you've shown me

13:12.208 --> 13:14.294

13:12.208 --> 13:14.294

13:14.335 --> 13:15.962

13:14.335 --> 13:15.962
-Dang.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.233
make sure he's not weird.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.318
He's just a normal guy

13:38.359 --> 13:39.444
who's a friend of Hitchcock's--

13:39.486 --> 13:41.070
yep, we gotta check him out.

13:41.112 --> 13:43.323
[rhythmic tapping]

13:46.785 --> 13:47.952
Yeah, he's gonna

13:46.785 --> 13:47.952

Oh my God, he is.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.246
The Hitchcock Way

13:49.036 --> 13:50.246
is exactly

13:50.288 --> 13:52.206
what we needed,

13:50.288 --> 13:52.206
you know?

13:52.248 --> 13:54.167
These last six months have

13:52.248 --> 13:54.167
actually been pretty hard.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.376
Mm, no!

13:55.418 --> 13:56.795
Hitchcock doesn't

13:55.418 --> 13:56.795
dwell on the past.

13:56.835 --> 13:59.213
Hitchcock forgets

13:56.835 --> 13:59.213
about the past

13:59.255 --> 14:01.174
because of the spots

13:59.255 --> 14:01.174
on his brain!

14:01.215 --> 14:03.009
Yes.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.009
To brain spots!

14:08.014 --> 14:10.600
of drink roulette.

14:10.642 --> 14:13.019
Lieutenant, I never see you

14:10.642 --> 14:13.019
at Shaw's on a Sunday.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.854
Those nights are usually

14:13.060 --> 14:15.854
reserved for spending time

14:13.060 --> 14:15.854
with your family.

14:15.896 --> 14:18.608
I guess you do make...

14:15.896 --> 14:18.608
exceptions.

14:18.650 --> 14:19.818
What?

14:19.859 --> 14:21.528
The conversation

14:19.859 --> 14:21.528
we had six months ago?

14:21.569 --> 14:23.237
The one where you

14:21.569 --> 14:23.237
said you wouldn't make

14:21.569 --> 14:23.237
an exception for me.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.532
That was so long ago.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.532
A lot has happened

14:23.279 --> 14:25.532
since then.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.159
Well, to me it seems like

14:25.573 --> 14:28.159
mere minutes ago,

14:28.201 --> 14:31.287
because I've been living the

14:28.201 --> 14:31.287
same day over and over again.

14:31.329 --> 14:33.914
Gentlemen, would either

14:31.329 --> 14:33.914
of you mind giving some toasts?

14:33.956 --> 14:36.042
People are starting to notice

14:33.956 --> 14:36.042
we didn't serve any food.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.627
I have something

14:36.083 --> 14:37.627
I'd like to say.

14:37.669 --> 14:39.253
Marriage is amazing.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.964
To get to spend every day

14:39.295 --> 14:41.964
with the same person,

14:42.006 --> 14:44.801
day after day,

14:42.006 --> 14:44.801

14:44.843 --> 14:48.555
The comfort of knowing

14:44.843 --> 14:48.555
that tomorrow will be

14:44.843 --> 14:48.555
just like today

14:48.596 --> 14:51.516
is truly

14:48.596 --> 14:51.516
a rewarding assignment.

14:51.558 --> 14:52.684
To Hitchcock!

14:52.726 --> 14:53.934
-[man] Hear, hear.

14:52.726 --> 14:53.934
-[glasses clink]

14:53.976 --> 14:55.228
I'd also like

14:53.976 --> 14:55.228
to make a speech.

14:55.269 --> 14:58.022
Most marriages end in divorce,

14:58.064 --> 14:59.482
and there's a reason.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.735
It's boring to be stuck

14:59.524 --> 15:01.735
in the same routine forever.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.862
There's no value to be found

15:03.903 --> 15:06.113
in walking the same beat

15:03.903 --> 15:06.113
over and over,

15:06.155 --> 15:08.074
especially when you've been

15:06.155 --> 15:08.074
a captain for six years.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.785
The point is: marriage is

15:10.827 --> 15:13.788
a waste of my talents,

15:10.827 --> 15:13.788
Lieutenant.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.998
-To Hitchcock!

15:13.830 --> 15:15.998
-These are great.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.166
<i>Really?</i>

15:17.208 --> 15:18.918
I also have a toast to make.

15:18.959 --> 15:21.295
Hitchcock, I always thought

15:18.959 --> 15:21.295
I was better than you,

15:21.337 --> 15:24.424
because I haven't been

15:21.337 --> 15:24.424
divorced seven times

15:24.465 --> 15:26.926
and I've never been

15:24.465 --> 15:26.926
banned from a museum

15:26.967 --> 15:28.135
for kissing the statues.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.970
But today I realized

15:30.012 --> 15:33.307
that maybe my life would be

15:30.012 --> 15:33.307
better if I was more like you.

15:33.349 --> 15:37.144
Anyway, I gotta go

15:33.349 --> 15:37.144
make a baby of my own

15:37.186 --> 15:39.480

15:44.736 --> 15:46.279
OK, bud.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.449
Are you ready to have some

15:46.320 --> 15:49.449

15:49.490 --> 15:50.784
Oh, yeah,

15:49.490 --> 15:50.784
where are we going?

15:50.825 --> 15:52.243
Nowhere.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.495
We're going right here

15:52.285 --> 15:54.495

15:54.537 --> 15:57.039
Oh, that's such

Someone's in there.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.462
Should we wait?

16:02.503 --> 16:03.797
Would Hitchcock wait?

16:03.838 --> 16:06.883
Hell, no. Hitchcock would

16:03.838 --> 16:06.883

16:06.925 --> 16:08.718
Well, this is perfect.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.018
Don't worry about me.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.018
I don't want to join.

Oh. I guess I do.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.577

16:43.461 --> 16:45.546

16:45.588 --> 16:48.007
-Well, that's too bad,

He's cheating on her sister.

They made 600 babies,

18:39.660 --> 18:40.703

Why can't we make

18:40.745 --> 18:42.496
600 babies?

You can't compare yourself

18:42.538 --> 18:44.665

You taught me that.

-I got a number of useful tips.

19:22.745 --> 19:25.665
-All<i> right.</i>

19:50.023 --> 19:52.942
you'd never ask.

19:52.984 --> 19:54.568

19:54.610 --> 19:55.778

20:03.786 --> 20:06.747
And it has been a really

20:03.786 --> 20:06.747
hard couple of months.

20:06.789 --> 20:09.125
I'm sorry I'm bad

20:06.789 --> 20:09.125
at making babies.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.501
Hey, hey,

20:09.167 --> 20:10.501
don't say that.

20:10.543 --> 20:11.836
It's not your fault.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.546
And look, for all we know,

20:11.878 --> 20:13.546
I could have--

20:13.587 --> 20:15.798
Don't say you

20:13.587 --> 20:15.798
have bum nards.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.258
I'm not--

20:16.924 --> 20:18.258
I wasn't gonna--

20:18.300 --> 20:19.886
[scoffs]

20:19.927 --> 20:23.931
But I think maybe it's just

20:19.927 --> 20:23.931
a thing we can't control.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.892
Ohh. That is my least

20:23.973 --> 20:25.892
favorite kind of thing.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.434
I know.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.729
I really wanted

20:27.476 --> 20:29.729
to start a family.

20:30.855 --> 20:34.150
Amy, we are a family.

20:34.192 --> 20:35.651
You and me.

20:35.693 --> 20:37.319
So, you know,

20:35.693 --> 20:37.319
we can keep trying

20:37.361 --> 20:39.822
or look into IVF

20:37.361 --> 20:39.822
or adoption

20:39.864 --> 20:42.700
or if we want, we can

20:39.864 --> 20:42.700
forget about the whole thing.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.995
But if we're together,

20:42.742 --> 20:45.995
I'm happy... no matter what.

20:46.037 --> 20:48.330
I don't know

20:46.037 --> 20:48.330
what I want to do.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.999
Fine.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.999
That's OK too.

20:50.041 --> 20:51.458
We don't have

20:50.041 --> 20:51.458
to have a plan.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.127
We make the rules.

20:53.169 --> 20:54.795
Maybe it would help

20:53.169 --> 20:54.795
to just not think

20:54.837 --> 20:56.547
about the whole

20:54.837 --> 20:56.547
thing for a while

20:56.589 --> 20:57.924
and see where we're at.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.093
Yeah, OK.

21:00.134 --> 21:02.302
I love you.

21:02.344 --> 21:03.763
I love you.

21:14.857 --> 21:15.733
Should we go?

21:15.775 --> 21:17.317
-Yes.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.317
-OK.

21:18.903 --> 21:20.487
Nope.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.156
[sighs]

21:24.450 --> 21:25.910
<i>Fremulon.</i>

21:25.952 --> 21:28.204
<i>-Not a doctor.</i>

21:25.952 --> 21:28.204
-Shh.
