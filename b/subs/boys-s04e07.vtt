they thought that he was
the fucking leak. I'm done.

00:27.236 --> 00:28.904
Cameron Coleman wasn't the leak.

You're talking about a coup.

you need to extract the virus, and make it

00:52.887 --> 00:53.929

We're not just talking about

00:56.432 --> 00:58.851
we're talking about

09:58.265 --> 10:00.559
Which is why
I'm fucking telling you, innit?

that much blood on me hands?

Yeah, you do.
You want to fucking swim in it.

No, I don't.

10:08.191 --> 10:10.068
No, I do not.

10:11.028 --> 10:14.114
So, to keep the bug from
burning through you lot like wildfire,

10:14.197 --> 10:16.199
I thought ol' Sameer could do with

10:16.283 --> 10:17.451
-a bit of a hand.
