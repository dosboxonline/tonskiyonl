-We're investigating.

12:02.431 --> 12:03.932
Sir, I have to tell you
something.

12:03.974 --> 12:05.392
We have to tell Homelander,

12:05.434 --> 12:07.352
and I have to admit something
to you. I...

12:07.394 --> 12:10.939
You don't have the faintest
idea where Homelander is.

12:10.981 --> 12:14.109
He will know
when I want him to know.

12:14.151 --> 12:16.111
Just keep the rest
of the infants on 99

12:16.153 --> 12:18.738
in check, will you?

12:23.493 --> 12:25.203
(shuddering exhale)

12:25.245 --> 12:27.414
THOMAS ROBERTS:
...and if you are
just tuning in,

12:27.456 --> 12:29.708
we have some major
breaking news.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.043
Superheroes are not born
but made,

12:32.085 --> 12:36.631
in fact created by a chemical
serum, Compound V,

12:36.673 --> 12:39.718
produced and administered
by Vought International...

12:39.759 --> 12:41.511
-(chuckles)
-...the company that has been

12:41.553 --> 12:44.389
the corporate face
of superheroes for decades.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.016
-(sonic boom)
-Now, we don't know

12:46.057 --> 12:47.392
where their superpowers

12:47.434 --> 12:49.227
-actually came from.
-What... did you do?

12:49.269 --> 12:51.271
I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:51.313 --> 12:52.272
Oh, come on.

12:52.314 --> 12:54.566
I saw you with the V
in your hand.

12:54.608 --> 12:58.028
Yeah, and you let me
walk away with it, so...

12:58.069 --> 12:59.863
this is kind of on you, too.

12:59.905 --> 13:02.365
If I go down, you come with me.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.534
Pretty sure they'd kill us both.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.411
(sighs heavily)

13:06.453 --> 13:09.414
You don't get it.

13:09.456 --> 13:14.211
You don't fuck with the money.

13:14.252 --> 13:17.797
You never fuck with the money.

13:17.839 --> 13:23.261
We're gonna lose everything--
I mean, cars, houses, bonuses...

13:23.303 --> 13:26.264
There are more important things.

13:26.306 --> 13:30.185
You know, the only people
that say that...

13:30.227 --> 13:33.271
are the people who grew up
with money.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.273
ROBERTS:
...provided evidence

13:35.315 --> 13:37.609
proving Vought has been
administering Compound V

13:37.651 --> 13:40.570
to children for decades.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.656
Our very own reporting suggests

13:42.697 --> 13:45.408
the parents also received
a very generous payment.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.452
-It started when I was nine.
-Now, after the kids

13:47.494 --> 13:49.996
were treated with Compound V,
they were then monitored...

13:50.038 --> 13:53.416
I was at the mall.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.877
And we, uh...

13:55.919 --> 13:58.922
we passed the pet store...

14:01.174 --> 14:06.513
...and I heard the goldfish
begging for their lives.

14:06.555 --> 14:08.557
They were begging.

14:12.143 --> 14:16.356
And after that, I...

14:16.398 --> 14:20.569
The beach, the aquarium,
Red Lobster...

14:28.785 --> 14:31.913
I mean, I thought
I was going crazy, you know?

14:35.125 --> 14:37.627
But my mom said it was a gift.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.259
That I was born this way.

14:45.969 --> 14:48.388
But I wasn't.

14:52.183 --> 14:54.978
It didn't have to be this way.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.188
-I could've been normal.
-ROBERTS: But early reports

14:57.230 --> 14:59.190
seem to suggest the first
manifestation of powers

14:59.232 --> 15:01.067
-can cause fear and anxiety
-(sobbing)

15:01.109 --> 15:02.694
in the affected children,

15:02.736 --> 15:04.446
especially if they are not
carefully guided

15:04.487 --> 15:05.905
through the process.

15:05.947 --> 15:09.284
-(sobbing)
-So far, Vought has refused

15:09.326 --> 15:11.202
to release a statement.

15:11.244 --> 15:14.331
Likewise, Dr. Jonah Vogelbaum,
former C.S.O. at the company,

15:14.372 --> 15:16.374
refusing comment.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.793
He's been in seclusion
since an undisclosed accident

15:18.835 --> 15:20.670
-left him paralyzed.
-(answering machine beeps)
-Uh, hey.

15:20.712 --> 15:23.506
-Is this you?
-Vogelbaum all but disappearing
from public life.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.133
You did it.

15:25.175 --> 15:26.718
We did it.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.346
Um, call me. Call me back
when you get a chance.

15:29.387 --> 15:30.764
-(phone beeps off)
-...on their stock price,

15:30.805 --> 15:32.641
which is already
falling today,

15:32.682 --> 15:34.601
-MOTHER'S MILK: Did what?
-signaling a huge trend

15:34.643 --> 15:36.436
that could be potentially
catastrophic

15:36.478 --> 15:38.271
to Vought's bottom line.

15:38.313 --> 15:41.274
-You did this?
-(newscast continues)

15:41.316 --> 15:45.487
Uh, yeah. S-Starlight did,
mostly, I'm pretty sure,

15:45.528 --> 15:49.240
but I just gave her
an old alley-oop.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.868
(quietly):
Hughie.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.453
Hughie, yes!

15:53.495 --> 15:54.996
-Okay. (laughing)
-Hughie!

15:55.038 --> 15:56.790
Dude, look at what you
fucking did.

15:56.831 --> 15:58.583
-Oh, my God.
-You lads touchin' yer tips?

15:58.625 --> 16:00.085
MOTHER'S MILK:
Look at what the kid just did.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.628
Me and Starlight, but yeah.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.963
-Petit Hughie?
-The fucking kid.

16:04.005 --> 16:05.715
-Mm!
-(kisses)
-Oh, shit.

16:05.757 --> 16:06.966
Yes!

16:07.008 --> 16:09.386
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
-Nice one.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.429
MOTHER'S MILK:
That's all you got?

16:12.722 --> 16:14.891
We've been trying to do
this shit for years.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.768
Vought's finally fucking
going down,

16:16.810 --> 16:18.395
the kid did it,
and "nice one"?

16:18.436 --> 16:20.313
All right, real nice one.

16:21.564 --> 16:24.609
You can't even give me this,
can you?

16:24.651 --> 16:27.696
Not one goddamn win.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.906
I'll tell you what.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.574
When we're all done here,

16:31.616 --> 16:33.535
I'll buy you a nice, big,
family size bottle

16:33.576 --> 16:36.913
of top-shelf lube
and I'll tickle your balls

16:36.955 --> 16:39.708
till you beg me to stop
and even then I won't.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.042
I just won't do it.

16:41.084 --> 16:45.046
But right now, we got
a Supe terrorist below deck

16:45.088 --> 16:48.383
and shit could go sideways
just like... (snaps)

16:52.053 --> 16:57.016
So all of ya, keep your fucking
eyes on the ball, yeah?

17:04.232 --> 17:05.567
(pats arm)

17:05.608 --> 17:07.569
Don't worry about him.

17:07.610 --> 17:09.028
Yeah, fuck him.

17:09.070 --> 17:10.321
You did great.

17:20.457 --> 17:22.876
(birds chirping,
dog barks in distance)

17:22.917 --> 17:24.794
Isn't this great?

17:24.836 --> 17:27.130
-Yeah.
-(Homelander chuckles)

17:27.172 --> 17:30.550
Your mom ever bring you up here?

17:30.592 --> 17:31.968
No.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.344
Nah.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.805
Of course not.

17:35.847 --> 17:39.476
You see, that is why a boy
needs his father.

17:41.519 --> 17:45.064
Hey, I think it's time.

17:45.106 --> 17:49.027
Yeah. You ready?

17:49.068 --> 17:52.864
Um... ready for what?

17:52.906 --> 17:54.908
To jump.

18:04.709 --> 18:06.503
Wait, you can't be serious.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.463
I'm not going to jump.

18:08.505 --> 18:10.340
Ryan, you're my son.

18:10.381 --> 18:13.510
You can fly, just like me.

18:14.552 --> 18:17.096
I-I... I don't want to.

18:17.138 --> 18:20.099
You take a big, deep breath,
you step off

18:20.141 --> 18:21.726
and your body will just
do the rest.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.019
It'll just take over.

18:23.061 --> 18:24.813
But I-I can't fly.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.231
I'll just fall
right off of here and get...

18:26.272 --> 18:27.482
Hey, hey, hey, hey, buddy.

18:27.524 --> 18:30.276
You're gonna love it.
I promise.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.861
I'm nothing like you.
I-I can't fly.

18:31.903 --> 18:33.655
You can. You can.

18:33.696 --> 18:35.073
I promise you can.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.158
(breathes deeply)

18:37.200 --> 18:39.661
Dad, please.

18:39.702 --> 18:42.288
Please, don't make me jump.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.958
(clicks tongue):
Aw.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.252
Buddy.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.965
You called me Dad.

18:53.883 --> 18:55.593
(chuckles)

18:55.635 --> 18:57.762
(Ryan gasps, screams)

19:01.724 --> 19:03.476
(sputters)

19:03.518 --> 19:05.728
-(door opens)
-BECCA: Ryan.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.730
God. Ryan!

19:07.772 --> 19:08.898
Hey. Hey, hey.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.316
What did you do?

19:10.358 --> 19:13.278
It's fine. It's a 20-foot drop.
Relax.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.279
Inhuman fucking monster.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.488
-Come here.
-Don't help him up.

19:15.530 --> 19:17.824
-Let him do it himself.
-Come here. Baby, hey.

19:17.866 --> 19:19.659
Hey, Ryan, I need you
to wake up.

19:19.701 --> 19:22.412
Baby, can you hear me?
I'm right here.

19:22.453 --> 19:24.080
-I don't think he's breathing.
-(laughing)

19:24.122 --> 19:25.582
-He's fine.
-I don't think he's breathing.

19:25.623 --> 19:27.792
-I don't think he's... (gasps)
-(gasps) Mom?

19:27.834 --> 19:29.460
-Hi. Hi.
-Look. See?

19:29.502 --> 19:30.879
-Told ya.
-Hi, sweetie.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.255
Are you hurt? (kisses)

19:32.297 --> 19:33.423
Does anything feel broken?

19:33.464 --> 19:34.716
-Oh, for God's sake, broken?
-Let me see.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.426
Come on, look at him.
There's not a scratch on him.

19:36.467 --> 19:39.512
You know why?
'Cause he's my son.

19:39.554 --> 19:41.264
And you, you... (scoffs)

19:41.306 --> 19:43.057
...you're raising him
to be a pussy.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.350
You don't get to tell me
how to raise my son.

19:44.392 --> 19:45.643
I'm his father.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.353
You don't get to say that
after what you did.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.355
What I did to you...

19:49.397 --> 19:51.190
was give you a son,

19:51.232 --> 19:53.192
that you are raising

19:53.234 --> 19:55.278
-like a little girl.
-(Ryan breathing rapidly)

19:55.320 --> 19:56.654
Let go of me.

19:56.696 --> 20:00.283
-He's mine.
-Get your hands off of her!

20:00.325 --> 20:03.202
(Ryan breathing rapidly)

20:03.244 --> 20:05.246
(rapid breathing continues)

20:10.668 --> 20:13.046
Good boy.

20:13.087 --> 20:14.756
See?

20:14.797 --> 20:17.717
-I told you.
-What?

20:17.759 --> 20:18.760
You're just like me, Ryan.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.303
No, I'm not like you.

20:20.345 --> 20:21.804
I'm nothing like you!
I fucking hate you!

20:21.846 --> 20:22.889
Leave us alone!

20:22.931 --> 20:24.849
Hey, hey, it's okay.
I'm not angry.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.477
-Ryan.
-Go away!

20:27.518 --> 20:29.562
-Buddy, it's o...
-Leave us alone!

20:29.604 --> 20:32.065
Ryan, this is a good thing.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.526
(door opens)

20:35.568 --> 20:36.569
(door closes)

20:40.782 --> 20:42.283
(door opens)

20:49.165 --> 20:52.043
So, um...

20:55.713 --> 20:59.509
These are horrible,
powdered cheese things,

20:59.550 --> 21:02.011
but, um, if you're hungry?

21:06.432 --> 21:07.684
Fuck you.

21:07.725 --> 21:10.436
So you do speak English.

21:13.898 --> 21:16.609
Thirsty?

21:24.200 --> 21:25.660
-(slurps)
-You know,

21:25.702 --> 21:28.705
the way you talk
with your sister...

21:28.746 --> 21:30.915
it's no sign language
I ever seen.

21:34.127 --> 21:37.714
I just want to help her.

21:40.466 --> 21:43.761
I can help her.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.596
Tu comprends?

21:45.638 --> 21:48.016
You understand?

21:53.855 --> 21:56.274
The night our parents
were murdered...

21:57.316 --> 22:01.070
...Kimiko just stopped talking.

22:01.112 --> 22:02.905
Can't talk.

22:02.947 --> 22:05.783
She's never made a sound since.

22:05.825 --> 22:08.453
In the camp,

22:08.494 --> 22:12.290
we were alone week after week,

22:12.331 --> 22:15.918
just the two of us, for years.

22:18.880 --> 22:22.633
We... came up a language

22:22.675 --> 22:25.511
so we could get through it.

22:26.554 --> 22:27.847
(laughs softly)

22:27.889 --> 22:31.017
I-It saved us.

22:31.059 --> 22:33.770
Both of us.

22:37.607 --> 22:39.942
Will you teach me?

22:44.447 --> 22:46.324
(slurping)

22:46.365 --> 22:48.534
(sighs)

22:48.576 --> 22:51.037
(clears throat, sniffs)

22:51.079 --> 22:53.539
(quietly):
Please.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.418
Fuck you.

23:06.427 --> 23:10.223
I think your sister
is very special.

23:12.183 --> 23:15.603
And she loves you very much.

23:37.500 --> 23:40.503
(grunts)

23:45.091 --> 23:48.094
(straining)

23:55.518 --> 23:57.854
(can crinkling)

24:02.733 --> 24:05.194
(groans in pain)

24:05.236 --> 24:07.238
(breathing rapidly)

24:09.073 --> 24:11.742
I don't know anything about
this Compound V monkey business.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.369
If someone gave it
to my little Maeve,

24:13.411 --> 24:15.204
I sure as hell didn't know.

24:15.246 --> 24:17.206
-Bullshit he didn't know.
-(turns off TV)

24:17.248 --> 24:18.666
I remember this one weekend

24:18.708 --> 24:20.585
where he made me do
three mall appearances

24:20.626 --> 24:22.211
and a photo shoot
for Teen Vogue,

24:22.253 --> 24:25.631
all to get the cash for
my braces, which he then blew

24:25.673 --> 24:28.050

some intel on the boat.
-Okay...

and then, fuck,

42:31.841 --> 42:33.426
they just ran right into her.

you can welcome me back

my road is long and hard.

everyone in the tunnels.

on the target,

43:51.921 --> 43:53.381

with the ladies,

44:04.392 --> 44:05.435
but it's going to be okay.

Shouldn't we...
take him to the police?

Yes, he is. Yes, we should.

47:09.327 --> 47:10.954
Kill him.

Right now.

Kill.

Do it.

You kill him

I know the news of Compound V
came as a shock to everyone.

53:32.543 --> 53:33.961
As you can imagine,

53:34.003 --> 53:36.422
this has been a very difficult
day for the Vought family.

Our focus now will be
to learn the truth.

As I said, we are conducting
a robust investigation

but let me be clear:

53:47.558 --> 53:50.978
I had no knowledge whatsoever.

53:51.020 --> 53:53.648
We believe it was the work
of a small,

53:53.689 --> 53:56.108
disaffected group of scientists

53:56.150 --> 54:00.237
led by former Vought employee
Madelyn Stillwell.

54:00.279 --> 54:04.325
But sadly, there are more
important matters at hand.

54:04.367 --> 54:06.160
Everyone at Vought

54:06.202 --> 54:08.579
sends their thoughts
and prayers

54:08.621 --> 54:11.874

that were affected today.

could have been far worse,

54:17.171 --> 54:19.090
today's attack underscores

just how dangerous the threat
of Super terrorists has become.

America needs its heroes

on a different front:

54:36.565 --> 54:38.943
right here at home.

54:38.985 --> 54:40.486
These enemies
will stop at nothing

54:40.528 --> 54:41.487
to infiltrate our borders

54:41.529 --> 54:43.364
and attack our citizens.

54:43.406 --> 54:47.368
Our superheroes are
the last line of defense.

would have been much higher
