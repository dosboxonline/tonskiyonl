Look, Em, we cannot keep doing this,

12:50.458 --> 12:53.500
[Emily] Okay, so… what?
We get out and… go civilian?

12:54.291 --> 12:55.875
They knew we was on that plane.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.083
We've been compromised.

So what? We… we go off the grid?

13:01.041 --> 13:04.208
Well… everybody's gonna think
we died in that crash, right?

13:04.291 --> 13:06.708
-Yeah.
-So that gives us a chance to disappear.

13:06.791 --> 13:11.000
Yep, we start over. We're gonna have to
cut off contact with everyone.

13:11.083 --> 13:12.583
I can do that. I don't have anybody.

13:12.666 --> 13:14.625
-I mean, you got your mother.
-[chuckles]

13:14.708 --> 13:16.375

He's our friend. This is our family.

We just leave behind

everything we've ever known?

13:30.625 --> 13:33.166
That's correct.
Because everything just changed.

You know that if I didn't have
superior inner thigh strength,

13:36.000 --> 13:37.166
you would be dead, right?

13:39.291 --> 13:41.416

13:42.041 --> 13:43.333
And we didn't die.

-So are we really gonna do this?
-Hell yeah, we gon' do this.

13:45.958 --> 13:49.291

I don't know what we're gonna do, but…

I'mma tell you something,
I'm not saying it's due to my coaching.

-But I think it might be…
-All due to your coaching. That's right.

14:44.208 --> 14:46.666

Know what they say about my soccer game?

14:46.750 --> 14:48.208

Alice, let's go!

-Let's go, let's go, let's go!
-Still brushing my teeth.

15:05.625 --> 15:08.791
She's brushing her teeth for 20 minutes?
She's on her stupid phone.

15:08.875 --> 15:12.250
I told you, if you're mad about the phone,
take that thing away from her.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.458
-You take the phone away.
-Mm-mm. I'm scared of her.

15:14.541 --> 15:16.541
I know. It's terrifying, right?

15:16.625 --> 15:18.541
Especially that look she gives…

15:18.625 --> 15:21.416
-[Emily] Alice, your teeth are clean!
-I'm coming!

15:21.500 --> 15:23.041
Remember when she used to like us?

15:23.125 --> 15:25.333
I don't remember that.
It was a long time ago.

15:25.416 --> 15:28.375
Mm. Maybe I should bring back
Monday movie nights with Mom.

-[groans doubtfully]
-You know, that's kind of a good idea.

15:31.375 --> 15:33.916

-Mm.

-That's a lot of baby oil. You sure--
-Is it though?

15:36.083 --> 15:38.958
What… what'd you and your mom do,
you know, when you was 14?

15:39.041 --> 15:40.875
When I was 14? Gosh.

15:40.958 --> 15:44.083
Well, my mom was deployed to Beirut
and forgot to tell me, so…

15:44.166 --> 15:45.250
Right. Bad example.

15:45.333 --> 15:47.833
-Yeah, it's a really different childhood.
-[video game chimes]

15:50.250 --> 15:51.375
[Leo] Yeah.

15:51.458 --> 15:55.375
So were you playing video games
last night after lights-out?

15:55.458 --> 15:56.583
No. [chuckles]

15:59.833 --> 16:02.500
Yes. Okay, I'm sorry.

16:02.583 --> 16:04.875
I shook you too fast, baby. You had me.

16:04.958 --> 16:08.041
Don't be so shook so quick, all right?
Work on that.

16:08.125 --> 16:10.166
Wait, what're you mad about again?

16:10.250 --> 16:13.083
-[muttering indistinctly]
-No, please don't encourage him to lie.

Why not? You guys lie all the time.

-Excuse me? What?
-What'd you say, little lady?

16:16.916 --> 16:20.083
The other day, Dad, I heard you
talking to the AC guy in Russian.

16:20.166 --> 16:22.333
-What was that all about?
-That was Bobby Brown.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.166
That's my prerogative.
That's what that was about.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.875
-You speak Russian?
-I dabble. You know, like, uh… uh… uh…

16:26.958 --> 16:30.458
"Do svidaniya," or "Sputnik," "Gorbachev."
You know, white Russian.

16:30.541 --> 16:32.666
But you were talking
about the air conditioning system.

16:32.750 --> 16:34.250
You know, your dad and I,

16:34.333 --> 16:37.125
we picked up some basic Russian
while there during the Peace Corps.

16:37.208 --> 16:39.166
I thought you did Peace Corps in Colombia.

16:39.250 --> 16:40.708
-Where you met.
-[Matt] Where we met?

16:40.791 --> 16:42.708
-Yeah.
-Yeah. We met where we met.

16:42.791 --> 16:44.166
-Mm-hmm, Colombia.
-[Matt] Mm-hmm.

16:44.250 --> 16:47.000
-We went from Colombia to Russia.
-[Matt] Colombia to Belize.

16:47.083 --> 16:49.375
-Okay.
-I Belize it's next to Colombia.

16:49.458 --> 16:50.916
[Emily] Yeah. Exactly.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.583
-Colombia, Belize, Russia.
-[Matt] Yeah.

16:53.666 --> 16:56.166
You know, we got around.
Peace doesn't just happen.

16:56.250 --> 16:57.666
And… and… and not only that.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.416
-Kushay zavtrak.
-Huh?

16:59.500 --> 17:01.083
-What does that mean?
-It means…

17:01.166 --> 17:02.333
[both] "Eat your breakfast."

17:06.750 --> 17:09.208
[Emily sighs] I've got
a couple of appointments this afternoon.

17:09.291 --> 17:11.625
-Can you grab the dry cleaning for me?
-[Matt] Alright.

17:11.708 --> 17:14.958
[Emily] We've gotta do a Costco run.
We are out of so many things.

17:15.041 --> 17:15.916
[Matt] Okay.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.666
Whoa. You shouldn't be drinking
Diet Coke this early in the morning.

17:18.750 --> 17:20.750
I'm pretty sure Diet Coke blocks cancer.

17:20.833 --> 17:23.125
-Where'd you get that from?
-Give me that.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.166
It's not available to you right now.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.666
Hey. Can you take those off?

17:29.416 --> 17:30.500
-What?
-I wouldn't.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.833
-[muffled music through headphones]
-[Emily] Hmm.

17:32.916 --> 17:33.958
What are you listening to?

17:34.041 --> 17:35.541
-[music pauses]
-You wouldn't know it.

17:35.625 --> 17:37.541
[chuckles] Got me. Probably wouldn't.

17:37.625 --> 17:41.500
Um, I was just wondering if you…
had any plans after the game tonight.

17:41.583 --> 17:42.666
Why?

17:42.750 --> 17:45.625
I just thought you might want
to invite some friends over,

17:45.708 --> 17:47.916
and we can make mocktails,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.583
and we could catch up
on all the juicy gossip.

17:50.666 --> 17:52.958
I'm studying at Annalise's tonight.

17:53.041 --> 17:55.166
-Strike two.
-Right. Of course.

17:55.250 --> 17:57.041
You love… [chuckles] …studying.

17:58.041 --> 18:01.291
Well, Monday is really open for me.

18:01.375 --> 18:03.583
Thought we could do, like, movie night?

18:03.666 --> 18:05.125
-I'm good.
-[Emily] Really?

18:05.208 --> 18:07.291
-You… you're good? You sure?
-[beep]

18:07.375 --> 18:08.541
-[music resumes]
-Okay.

18:09.375 --> 18:10.375
[scoffs softly]

18:10.458 --> 18:11.833
I'll do movie night with you.

18:11.916 --> 18:13.041
-[Emily] You will?
-Of course.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.833
-Even Creed III?
-To help, I'll put some baby oil on.

18:15.916 --> 18:17.958
Like, uh… like Michael B.
You know what I'm saying?

18:18.041 --> 18:20.291
All right, we are here.

18:21.041 --> 18:24.000
Alright, honey.
Well, have a great day at school.

18:25.708 --> 18:27.250
No, I love you more!

18:28.666 --> 18:32.208
Hey, Leo, don't forget
that we have late pickup today, okay?

18:32.291 --> 18:34.791
[groans softly] What're you doing,
wearing that again?

18:34.875 --> 18:36.458
Uh, I mean, it's awesome.

18:36.541 --> 18:39.541
Tracks my sleep patterns, my O2 intake,
even my blood pressure.

18:39.625 --> 18:41.500
You're 12 years old.
You don't have blood pressure.

18:41.583 --> 18:43.791
It's a little big for your fingers,
isn't it?

18:43.875 --> 18:45.666
That's why I wear it on my thumb.

18:45.750 --> 18:48.500
Okay, how about tomorrow we get outside?
You know, throw the football around?

18:48.583 --> 18:49.791
Haven't you heard about CTE?

18:49.875 --> 18:52.375
We're playing catch.
You know I used to play, right?

18:52.458 --> 18:54.750
Yeah. You should probably
get yourself checked out.

18:54.833 --> 18:57.541
[Emily chuckling] Ooh! Burn!

18:57.625 --> 18:58.791
[chuckles, gasps]

18:58.875 --> 19:01.333
[Matt] Don't know about CTE.
I'll show him some CTE.

19:01.916 --> 19:03.541
-Do you see that?
-See what?

19:03.625 --> 19:05.250
She's with that boy again.

19:05.875 --> 19:07.583
-Where'd you get those?
-Amazon.

19:07.666 --> 19:09.333
Give her her space, babe.

19:09.416 --> 19:12.208
No, she's with him again. She's--
They're holding hands today.

19:13.625 --> 19:14.541
[gasps]

19:15.375 --> 19:16.625
-They just kissed.
-What?

19:16.708 --> 19:17.541
Kissin'?

19:18.750 --> 19:21.416
What 14-year-old has a mustache?

19:21.500 --> 19:23.416
His name is James, and he's 16.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.791
-Oh, hell no!
-God. I've never seen them kiss before.

19:25.875 --> 19:27.916
-Where'd you get those?
-What do you mean? Amazon.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.250
[sighs] You got mad
when I got a new leaf blower.

19:30.333 --> 19:31.666
-[ringing]
-Can't believe-- [gasps]

19:31.750 --> 19:33.583
Shit. What do we do? Oh, it's her.

19:33.666 --> 19:35.208
-You gotta answer.
-[Emily] She saw us.

19:35.291 --> 19:38.125
-[Matt] Decline it. She'll never know.
-Wait. Put those down.

19:38.208 --> 19:39.375
[Matt] Shit. Gotta answer it.

19:40.541 --> 19:41.375
[Emily] Hey, honey!

19:41.458 --> 19:43.041
-Mom?
-Did you forget something?

19:43.125 --> 19:44.750
-What are you guys doing?
-Uh…

19:44.833 --> 19:47.000
That is so creepy. Are those binoculars?

19:47.625 --> 19:49.541
Yeah, well, your mama was creepy first.

19:49.625 --> 19:51.666
You guys actually need a life.
Like, seriously.

19:51.750 --> 19:54.250
I'll be home after I'm done
studying at Annalise's. Bye.

19:54.333 --> 19:55.541
-Okay.
-[disconnect tone]

19:55.625 --> 19:57.583
I told you, you gotta
take that phone away from her.

19:57.666 --> 19:59.041
[school bell rings]

19:59.125 --> 20:00.333

deems me ready for MI6.

59:15.791 --> 59:18.000
I'm sort of her special little project.

59:18.083 --> 59:19.125
[Ginny chuckles]

59:19.791 --> 59:21.250
-Big N.
-Mm?

59:21.333 --> 59:24.375
-This is my daughter, Emily.
-No. No, it's not.

59:24.458 --> 59:25.500
[Ginny] Yes, Emily.

59:25.583 --> 59:26.500
Emzo.

59:26.583 --> 59:28.375
And her husband,

59:28.458 --> 59:29.875
the very handsome Matthew.

59:29.958 --> 59:32.833
-Matty. Yes. Like I hadn't noticed.
-Yes, and their children.

59:32.916 --> 59:34.208
That's Alice and Leo.

59:34.291 --> 59:36.750
-Wow. I love kids.
-[Ginny] Yes, he does.

59:36.833 --> 59:39.666
It's… it's your innocence.
Your sense of wonder.

59:39.750 --> 59:42.875
Now let me just plop this on the table
like a hot jelly on Christmas morning.

59:42.958 --> 59:45.291
[sighs] Would you like
to call me Granddad?

59:45.375 --> 59:47.125
What? No.

59:47.208 --> 59:50.416
Yes. Well… okay. It's complex, right?

59:50.500 --> 59:54.041
Look, I… I hope for you two
to not see me so much as a father figure.

59:54.125 --> 59:56.291
-Say what?
-Because what I really want…

59:57.125 --> 59:58.708
[sighs] …Matty, Emzo,

59:59.541 --> 01:00:01.208
is for you to see me as a friend.

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:04.208
Not likely.

01:00:04.291 --> 01:00:06.708
So is it yes or no on the gin?

01:00:06.791 --> 01:00:07.708
[Emily] It's a no.

01:00:08.333 --> 01:00:10.041
They are 14 and 12.

01:00:10.125 --> 01:00:12.833
-They drink water or orange juice.
-Yeah… [sputters]

01:00:12.916 --> 01:00:16.791
Look. Why don't we just cut to the chase?
We have a lot we need to get done. Nigel.

01:00:16.875 --> 01:00:17.708
Ah?

01:00:17.791 --> 01:00:19.416
Could you show the kids around?

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.750
The grandkids?
Oh, help them out. Yeah, sure.

01:00:21.833 --> 01:00:23.625
-Granddad duties, Ginny P.
-[moans]

01:00:24.208 --> 01:00:27.458
[Nigel] Okay, do you guys
happen to like incredible stuff?

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:29.041
Wanna come to my cool office?

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:29.958
-Yeah.
-Come on.

01:00:30.041 --> 01:00:32.291
-[sirens wailing]
-[suspenseful music playing]

01:00:33.041 --> 01:00:35.166
[distant sirens wailing]

01:00:39.208 --> 01:00:41.958
-[Baron] Come on, let's have it.
-[officer] Here you go, sir.

01:00:43.875 --> 01:00:46.666
[Baron] "It's not your accent.
It's your personality."

01:00:47.166 --> 01:00:50.041
-Matt, you're so predictable.
-[keypad beeping]

01:00:50.125 --> 01:00:51.958
God, she must be bored out of her mind.

01:00:52.041 --> 01:00:53.083
Thank you.

01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:56.958
-What?
-[Wendy] It's the Key.

01:00:57.041 --> 01:00:59.791
We're hearing chatter from multiple
channels that it's definitely in play.

01:00:59.875 --> 01:01:00.750
What about the car?

01:01:00.833 --> 01:01:03.291
Satellites were able
to track the Land Rover to here.

01:01:03.375 --> 01:01:05.166
But we lost them under cloud cover
ten minutes ago.

01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:06.083
Great.

01:01:06.166 --> 01:01:08.833
Best guess, they're somewhere
in this five-mile radius.

01:01:08.916 --> 01:01:11.500
This is an old munitions factory.
This is a horse farm.

01:01:11.583 --> 01:01:13.458
-This is a racetrack.
-What's this?

01:01:14.125 --> 01:01:15.666
[device beeps, whirs]

01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:17.333
I don't know. Uh…

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:23.375
Land is registered
to an offshore non-profit

01:01:23.458 --> 01:01:24.833
headquartered in the Isle of Man.

01:01:24.916 --> 01:01:27.083
-"Foxhunter Ltd."
-"Foxhunter"?

01:01:28.458 --> 01:01:29.791
Why do I know that name?

01:01:30.375 --> 01:01:31.500
Ginny Curtis.

01:01:32.291 --> 01:01:34.708
Well, she's an MI6 girlboss legend.

01:01:39.583 --> 01:01:40.708
[Matt] Listen, Ginny.

01:01:40.791 --> 01:01:45.250
When Emily and I went to ground…
I took something very valuable.

01:01:45.333 --> 01:01:48.125
If you don't have leverage,
make it. Cheers.

01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:50.458
-[glasses clink]
-[Ginny] I knew I liked him.

01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:52.375
[Emily] Wait till you hear the next part.

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:55.541
As you can see,
there's nothing cool in here at all.

01:01:55.625 --> 01:01:58.541
-[chuckles]
-This is your office? What do you do?

01:01:58.625 --> 01:02:00.666
What don't I do?
That's what you should be asking.

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:03.208
-[chuckles]
-But what do you do for, like, work?

01:02:03.291 --> 01:02:04.708
Like, what's your job?

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.583
Uh, so this is where I keep my equipment,
if you wanna call it that. [laughs]

01:02:09.666 --> 01:02:13.291
You name it, I've mastered it.
We've got sais. We've got nunchucks.

01:02:13.375 --> 01:02:16.083
We've got a baton.
That's my lower back. Um…

01:02:16.166 --> 01:02:18.916
We've got throwing stars,
which I'm getting pretty good at.

01:02:20.083 --> 01:02:23.000
[scoffs] That's a wall.
And I hit so many things.

01:02:23.083 --> 01:02:25.291
-[Leo] Let me try.
-Okay, yeah, careful. Very sharp.

01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:27.916
Sure, go for it, but I'm not sure
it's gonna do much. [chuckles]

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.041
Be careful with my star.

01:02:31.791 --> 01:02:33.375
-[Leo] Uh… Oh.
-Per-- Yeah.

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:36.458
I've not yet managed to do that.
That's… something.

01:02:36.541 --> 01:02:39.041
[chuckles] God.
Would you like to have a go?

01:02:39.125 --> 01:02:41.875
-I'm actually gonna go… find the bathroom.
-[metallic clang]

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:44.125
Sure. Why should the star
need another star?

01:02:44.208 --> 01:02:45.583
[laughs] You're already a star.

01:02:45.666 --> 01:02:47.500
To wrap it up,
we've got black-light cigarettes,

01:02:47.583 --> 01:02:49.750
we've got a laser watch,
and we've got a bulletproof umbrella.

01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:51.000
A bulletproof umbrella?

01:02:51.083 --> 01:02:52.875
If you're gonna be a spy, you… you…

01:02:52.958 --> 01:02:55.458
you really have to be prepared
for absolutely anything.

01:02:55.541 --> 01:02:57.708
-Is that what the health tracker's for?
-Ah.

01:02:57.791 --> 01:03:00.250
No. This, uh…
this monitors my, uh, sleeping patterns.

01:03:00.333 --> 01:03:04.208
Your grandma has a habit of keeping me up
all night… [chuckles] …with her snoring.

01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:08.791
Oh, look. You've got one too.
Twinsies. [laughs]

01:03:08.875 --> 01:03:10.166
Here's the thing, Ginny.

01:03:11.958 --> 01:03:13.083
I, uh…

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:15.250
I hid it here.

01:03:18.291 --> 01:03:21.416
-I assume others are looking for it.
-[Matt breathes deeply]

01:03:22.583 --> 01:03:23.708
Yeah.

01:03:23.791 --> 01:03:26.500
[Ginny] So, after all this time,

01:03:26.583 --> 01:03:29.375
you've dragged your problems
to my doorstep.

01:03:29.458 --> 01:03:31.666
It's not always about you.

01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:34.625
That's because, in my experience,
it's always been about you.

01:03:34.708 --> 01:03:38.208
I have tried my entire life
not to be like you.

01:03:38.291 --> 01:03:40.083
To be the mother that you never were.

01:03:40.666 --> 01:03:43.875
Loving, stable… nurturing.

01:03:43.958 --> 01:03:46.208
-Overbearing.
-No! God!

01:03:47.541 --> 01:03:48.666
Present.

01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:50.958
Present in my child's life.

01:03:51.041 --> 01:03:54.041
-How's that working out for you?
-Actually, it's working out really good.

01:03:54.125 --> 01:03:56.458
Now, I'm glad we got that settled,
because we, uh--

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:58.416
That's what I thought.

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.208
Your daughter hates you.

01:04:00.291 --> 01:04:04.041
You gave up everything for her,
and she still hates you.

01:04:04.125 --> 01:04:08.458
Okay. You know what? I could…
I could live with why Alice hates me.

01:04:08.541 --> 01:04:11.541
I could. But can you live with
why I hate you?

01:04:11.625 --> 01:04:13.458
Hate is such a strong word.

01:04:13.541 --> 01:04:15.458
-We could probably find a…
-Whatever.

01:04:15.541 --> 01:04:18.166
I did something that you could never do.

01:04:18.833 --> 01:04:20.833
I chose my family over my career.

01:04:20.916 --> 01:04:22.791
But we ended up
in the same place, didn't we?

01:04:23.458 --> 01:04:25.375
Doesn't matter
what kind of mother you are.

01:04:25.458 --> 01:04:28.166
Teenage girls rebel. I did it to mine.

01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:30.875
You did it to me.
Yours is doing it to you.

01:04:30.958 --> 01:04:34.041
All you can hope for
is that you raised them well enough

01:04:34.125 --> 01:04:38.583
that they can take care of themselves
and that one day, they'll come back.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:42.041
Why would I ever wanna come back?

01:04:44.458 --> 01:04:48.166
You convinced yourself
that I callously shipped you off

01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:51.916
to boarding school in America
to make my life easier.

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:56.291
Well, you have conveniently forgotten
that you begged me to go.

01:04:56.375 --> 01:05:02.083
Now… I would like to spend
a few moments with my grandchildren.

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:06.833
I'm guessing that I won't have
many chances after this, will I?

01:05:07.541 --> 01:05:08.916
[tense music playing]

01:05:15.958 --> 01:05:17.041
[Emily sighs]

01:05:17.125 --> 01:05:18.541
[tense music continues]

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:22.458
Hey, guv. I'm not following.
What's the connection?

01:05:23.041 --> 01:05:24.000
[device beeps]

01:05:24.083 --> 01:05:26.583
[indistinct chatter over police radio]

01:05:29.041 --> 01:05:32.583
I'm not sure. Split up into three teams
and check out those locations.

01:05:32.666 --> 01:05:35.375
I'll pay Ms. Curtis a visit
when I clear it with SIS.

01:05:35.458 --> 01:05:37.166
Do we really need to wait
for authorization?

01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:41.541
Yes, Wendy. I'm not gonna storm her house
and risk ruining my career without it.

01:05:43.583 --> 01:05:45.166
[tense music continues]

01:05:50.833 --> 01:05:51.833
[phone keypad beeps]

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.708
Yeah, I think I've got something.

01:05:59.625 --> 01:06:00.916
I'm sending it to you now.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.333
[music fades]

01:06:02.416 --> 01:06:05.916
Can you believe that woman?
Blaming me for wanting to leave?

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.291
Yeah. Yeah, your mom is a piece of work,
but she's still your mom.

01:06:09.375 --> 01:06:10.708
[both panting]

01:06:10.791 --> 01:06:11.875
[Emily] Here?

01:06:11.958 --> 01:06:12.833
Come on.

01:06:14.791 --> 01:06:15.625
[Emily sighs]

01:06:15.708 --> 01:06:17.416
[wistful music playing]

01:06:30.791 --> 01:06:34.750
We took that just before she left
for boarding school in America.

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:37.750
I just love the way she's smiling.

01:06:37.833 --> 01:06:43.125
Though, now I realize it was really
because she was so happy to be on her own.

01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:45.208
But, you know, as a teenager,

01:06:45.291 --> 01:06:49.500
she never really seemed
to want to be part of my life.

01:06:50.083 --> 01:06:51.041
Though

01:06:51.666 --> 01:06:54.625
I really wasn't part of hers, was I?

01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:57.291
I dedicated my life to the service.

01:06:57.375 --> 01:07:01.791
That didn't leave
much time for her, did it?

01:07:03.166 --> 01:07:05.416
I don't ha… hate my mom.

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.125
Oh, I know you don't, dear.

01:07:07.875 --> 01:07:10.416
And I don't think she really hated me.

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.416
-She said you were dead.
-[chuckles]

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:16.416
Well… I was far from perfect.

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.708
Would you care for some tea, dear?

01:07:21.791 --> 01:07:22.708
Like boba?

01:07:22.791 --> 01:07:23.666
What?

01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:25.791
Sorry, I don't drink tea.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:28.250
You don't drink tea? And no gin?

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.166
And Emily thinks I'm a bad mother? Ha!

01:07:32.791 --> 01:07:34.458
Well, we're gonna fix all that.

01:07:34.541 --> 01:07:35.416
Come on.

01:07:36.125 --> 01:07:37.416
[dramatic music plays]

01:07:54.333 --> 01:07:56.750
-[buzzing]
-[rapid high-pitched beeping]

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:01.916
[music abates]

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.125
[music resumes]

01:08:03.208 --> 01:08:05.083
-[man 1] Move!
-[man 2] Go, go, go!

01:08:08.041 --> 01:08:09.250
[music fades out]

01:08:10.333 --> 01:08:12.000
-Do you code?
-Code?

01:08:12.083 --> 01:08:14.833
[scoffs] Yeah, I code.
Yeah. I love all that stuff.

01:08:14.916 --> 01:08:18.583
AR, VR, R&R, QR codes. All the R's. Yeah.

01:08:18.666 --> 01:08:21.750
You gotta be pretty tech-savvy
if you wanna get into MI6 these days.

01:08:21.833 --> 01:08:25.375
You gotta be James Bond and Q,
all in one package.

01:08:25.458 --> 01:08:28.458
You'd get in, no problem. [laughs]
You'd be a prime candidate.

01:08:28.541 --> 01:08:29.375
What do you mean?

01:08:29.458 --> 01:08:32.000
Your parents are spies.
It's… it's in your blood.

01:08:32.083 --> 01:08:33.958
But I'm nothing like them.

01:08:34.041 --> 01:08:36.041
Let's try something. I'm gonna run at you.

01:08:36.125 --> 01:08:38.000
-What?
-Yeah, I'm gonna run at you, okay?

01:08:38.083 --> 01:08:40.041
Do the first thing
that comes into your head.

01:08:40.125 --> 01:08:41.875
I'm not gonna hurt you. [chuckles]

01:08:41.958 --> 01:08:44.541
I do this sorta stuff all the time.
It's standard agency training.

01:08:44.625 --> 01:08:47.250
Okay? Three, two, one. [yells]

01:08:47.333 --> 01:08:49.000
No, no, please. [grunts]

01:08:49.083 --> 01:08:50.375
[Nigel wheezing]

01:08:50.458 --> 01:08:51.375
[winded gasp]

01:08:51.458 --> 01:08:52.708
-[Leo] Oh my God.
-[gasps]

01:08:52.791 --> 01:08:53.916
I'm so sorry.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.125
-I didn't know I could do that.
-[wheezily] It's okay.

01:08:56.208 --> 01:08:59.041
You've got tiny fists.
I'm used to big fists.

01:08:59.125 --> 01:09:02.625
-It sort of slipped through my ribs.
-I'm so-- I… I didn't mean it. Uh…

01:09:02.708 --> 01:09:03.791
[grunts]

01:09:03.875 --> 01:09:06.041
No, no, no. It's…
I'm trained to take a punch. Chill.

01:09:07.166 --> 01:09:08.625
How many push-ups can you do?

01:09:08.708 --> 01:09:10.583
[hesitantly] Um… 15?

01:09:11.333 --> 01:09:12.291
Fifteen?

01:09:13.416 --> 01:09:14.708
Okay. First to four.

01:09:14.791 --> 01:09:16.458
[suspenseful music playing]

01:09:23.041 --> 01:09:24.666
It's this way. Come on.

01:09:40.458 --> 01:09:41.333
Come on.

01:09:46.833 --> 01:09:47.875
[straining]

01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:54.208
Is it there?

01:10:03.791 --> 01:10:04.791
What's this?

01:10:04.875 --> 01:10:06.625
This is for me, and that's for you.

01:10:09.458 --> 01:10:10.875
[poignant music plays]

01:10:10.958 --> 01:10:13.125
"Dear Emily, if you're reading this,

01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:16.250
it means we're in some kinda danger,
and it's most likely my fault."

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.041
"I'm sorry."

01:10:19.125 --> 01:10:21.500
"I was only trying to keep you and

01:10:22.333 --> 01:10:26.291
that angel growing inside of you safe."

01:10:26.916 --> 01:10:30.416
"Please never leave me,
because I'd be useless without you."

01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:32.666
"Like, it would be sad."

01:10:34.625 --> 01:10:36.291
You always say the right things.

01:10:36.375 --> 01:10:37.541
[Matt scoffs]

01:10:42.333 --> 01:10:43.708
Why did you really hide it here?

01:10:44.416 --> 01:10:46.708
I knew we were in danger,
and I knew you were pregnant.

01:10:48.041 --> 01:10:50.041
And I knew that if we needed this,

01:10:50.666 --> 01:10:51.916
then we'd need Ginny too.

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:55.083
Yeah.

01:10:55.166 --> 01:10:56.500

01:11:06.208 --> 01:11:07.083
[Matt] This way.

01:11:09.833 --> 01:11:11.250
Side door by the kitchen.

01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:24.791
[Matt] It's okay.

01:11:28.791 --> 01:11:31.208

01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:33.000

-[man 2] Don't move! Freeze!

-Where's our kids?
-[man 3] Living room. Move!

01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:58.625
-[guns cock]
-[man 4] Back up.

01:11:58.708 --> 01:11:59.958
You back up.

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:02.791
-Are you okay?
-[muffled grunt]

01:12:02.875 --> 01:12:03.916
-[soft grunt]
-[gun cocks]

01:12:05.125 --> 01:12:07.375
Look. We have what you're looking for.

01:12:07.458 --> 01:12:09.166
[breathes anxiously]

01:12:09.875 --> 01:12:11.083
Yeah. Here's the Key.

01:12:11.166 --> 01:12:12.875
Alright? It's right here.

01:12:12.958 --> 01:12:15.375
Let the kids go
and we can work something out.

01:12:16.041 --> 01:12:17.666
Baron! Get out here!

01:12:18.791 --> 01:12:19.791
Oh, guys.

01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:21.583
Chuck.

01:12:23.333 --> 01:12:24.875
[Chuck] Sorry to disappoint you.

01:12:24.958 --> 01:12:27.458
I kinda hoped
that I'd trained you better than that.

01:12:27.541 --> 01:12:29.083
[tense music plays]

01:12:30.916 --> 01:12:32.583
Hey, kiddos. Cat got your tongue?

01:12:34.375 --> 01:12:35.333
Emily, Matt.

01:12:35.416 --> 01:12:36.458
What is this?

01:12:37.625 --> 01:12:41.000
-Well, good to see ya.
-But, Chuck, we saw you get shot. It was--

01:12:41.083 --> 01:12:44.916
That was all me. I just figured you needed
some motivation to lead me to it.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.625
You and Baron
are in on this together, huh?

01:12:46.708 --> 01:12:48.250
Oh, no, no. He's clean as a whistle.

01:12:48.333 --> 01:12:51.458
We just needed to make sure
you didn't go crying to your old unit,

01:12:51.541 --> 01:12:52.583
so we dirtied him up a bit.

01:12:52.666 --> 01:12:55.791
Baron's been tracking Gor and the Volka,
not working with 'em.

01:12:55.875 --> 01:12:58.083
And… and as far as the men who shot me?

01:12:58.916 --> 01:12:59.875
Say hello, fellas.

01:12:59.958 --> 01:13:03.291
You know, it's amazing
what they can do with squibs these days.

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:06.541
[Matt, echoing] Chuck!

Uh, by the way…

01:13:17.458 --> 01:13:18.666
I'll take the Key.

01:13:19.458 --> 01:13:20.583
Please.

01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:23.625
-You're playing with our kids, Chuck.
-[Emily sighs]

01:13:26.208 --> 01:13:27.750
[Chuck] It's time to let it go, Matt.

01:13:27.833 --> 01:13:29.250
[music fades]

01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:36.166

01:14:16.875 --> 01:14:18.041
What happened to you?

01:14:18.125 --> 01:14:19.333
What happened to me?

01:14:20.250 --> 01:14:21.625
You two happened to me.

01:14:21.708 --> 01:14:22.750
What does that mean?

01:14:23.416 --> 01:14:25.583
Hmm? How's this our fault?

01:14:26.291 --> 01:14:28.833

Well, let's see, Matt.

01:14:37.875 --> 01:14:40.666
Two of my best agents
get abducted on their extraction flight.

01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:43.958
They're presumed dead.
The Key, presumed lost.

01:14:44.041 --> 01:14:47.416
The agency hung that on me.
I… I was put out to pasture.

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:49.666
Within a year, I lost my job.

01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:53.625
I lost my pension, my house,
my marriage, my dog!

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:57.000
All because of you two.

[panicked gasping]

01:15:18.541 --> 01:15:20.416
So this is about revenge?

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.333
No. No, it's about money.

01:15:22.416 --> 01:15:24.625
The revenge part is just the added bonus.

01:15:26.458 --> 01:15:27.625

-Are you sure you wanna interrupt me?
-Let 'em go!

As long as you two don't interfere,
this time tomorrow,

01:16:01.541 --> 01:16:03.208
these two will be returned safe and sound.

01:16:03.291 --> 01:16:04.333
It's okay, baby.

01:16:04.416 --> 01:16:05.833
Please don't call the authorities.

01:16:05.916 --> 01:16:08.208

-No, too far away.

-Fine. Yeah.
-Wait a minute.

01:17:17.625 --> 01:17:19.750
-Go back to the kids.
-Okay.

01:17:22.666 --> 01:17:24.291
Stop. Right there. Zoom in.

01:17:24.916 --> 01:17:27.333
-See that?
-[Emily] Wait. He's showing us something.

01:17:27.416 --> 01:17:29.458
The thumb ring.
He's wearing his thumb ring.

01:17:29.541 --> 01:17:30.833
-Exactly.
-His what?

01:17:30.916 --> 01:17:33.833
-Fitness tracker he wears on his thumb.
-It has GPS.
