♪ ♪

00:19.428 --> 00:21.687
Well, the first thing
I'm gonna do

00:21.872 --> 00:24.172
-with these pancakes
is eat them.
-There she is.

00:24.250 --> 00:26.007
Are you excited, Tina?
Are you pumped?

00:26.027 --> 00:27.768
-Should I be?
-Yes, you should be!

00:27.862 --> 00:29.695
The Cheese Royale starts today.

00:29.846 --> 00:31.922
Oh, that. Yeah. So pumped.

00:31.940 --> 00:33.423
Oh, yeah,
your Royal Cheese thing.

00:33.517 --> 00:34.867
Right. What-what is it again?

00:35.094 --> 00:37.870
The Cheese Royale is a game
where eighth-graders form teams

00:38.097 --> 00:40.372
and then fling slices of
American cheese at each other.

00:40.524 --> 00:42.282
And if you get hit with cheese,
you're out.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.709
And you can cheese people
anywhere

00:43.936 --> 00:45.377
except school
or inside their house.

00:45.604 --> 00:48.196
-Okay.
-It's just some dumb
eighth grade tradition.

00:48.290 --> 00:50.049
Some dumb
eighth grade tradition?!

00:50.217 --> 00:51.550
The Cheese Royale is
the only reason I plan

00:51.627 --> 00:52.793
to go to eighth grade.

00:52.945 --> 00:54.294
There's an eighth one now?

00:54.446 --> 00:56.463
Ooh, it does sound fun.
Is there a prize?

00:56.540 --> 00:57.798
Yeah, pride, honor,

00:57.892 --> 00:59.224
knowing you're the best
of the best.

00:59.301 --> 01:02.227
Plus, also money. Lots of money.
Twenties of dollars.

01:02.379 --> 01:04.063
And Matthew Ross's brother works
at Pizza Guys,

01:04.139 --> 01:05.898
and they're gonna send
free pizzas to the winners

01:06.049 --> 01:07.457
when his boss isn't around.

01:07.551 --> 01:09.459
I'm surprised the school
is okay with all this.

01:09.553 --> 01:11.128
Officially,
the school is aware of it,

01:11.146 --> 01:12.646
but they have no comment.

01:12.798 --> 01:14.907
That was their reaction to my
petition for Mariachi Mondays.

01:15.058 --> 01:16.891
It kind of just sounds like
there's gonna be a lot

01:16.985 --> 01:18.969
of cheese slices
on the ground everywhere.

01:19.062 --> 01:20.654
Yeah, Dad.
That's what war is like.

01:20.806 --> 01:23.490
So, what's going on, Tina?
You're not excited about this?

01:23.567 --> 01:25.809
Not really. I mean, I'm doing it
'cause everybody does it.

01:25.828 --> 01:30.330
<i> But I tried flinging cheese</i>
<i> and I was not great at it.</i>

01:30.424 --> 01:32.740
I just don't have what it takes
to throw cheese at people.

01:32.835 --> 01:35.168
Aw. No, honey. Sure you do.

01:35.321 --> 01:36.486
Tina, it's fine.

01:36.580 --> 01:38.913
The Cheese Royale is ten percent
cheese throwing

01:39.007 --> 01:40.248
and 90% strategy.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.658
Come on, get your game face on.

01:41.751 --> 01:43.660
Everyone picks their teams today
at lunch, right?

01:43.679 --> 01:45.104
Who are we thinking?
Who are we talking about?

01:45.255 --> 01:47.180
I mean, I was gonna group up
with Susmita?

01:47.333 --> 01:48.756
She doesn't seem like
the Cheese Royale type either.

01:48.851 --> 01:50.642
We'll just get through it
and have a couple laughs

01:50.794 --> 01:52.111
-along the way.
-Hmm.

01:52.338 --> 01:53.761
Ooh, like my circumcision.

01:53.781 --> 01:54.947
[crowd chatter]

01:55.116 --> 01:56.690
Hey, Susmita, want to team up
for Cheese Royale?

01:56.784 --> 01:59.025
Half-ass it and just
enjoy each other's company?

01:59.178 --> 02:01.528
Oh. Uh, I already grouped up
with a team.

02:01.605 --> 02:04.181
You did? But I thought
we were gonna be teammates.

02:04.274 --> 02:06.792
Tina, you literally told me
not to pick you for a teammate.

02:06.943 --> 02:08.443
What are you talking about?

02:08.520 --> 02:10.370
Ugh. I'm so bad
at throwing cheese.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.280
News flash.
Do not pick me as a teammate.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.540
Okay, got it.

02:13.692 --> 02:15.300
I thought you meant
"Okay, got it," like-like,

02:15.527 --> 02:17.027
"Okay, I got your news flash."

02:17.045 --> 02:18.286
I got both of them.

02:18.364 --> 02:19.787
Uh, I thought we were gonna bond

02:19.807 --> 02:20.973
over complaining
about this game.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.200
But you're telling me
you're into it?

02:23.293 --> 02:25.535
-So into it.
-Well, I hope you're very happy

02:25.629 --> 02:27.512
with your team of people
that all care

02:27.665 --> 02:29.890
-about this dumb,
stupid cheese thing.
-I am.

02:29.984 --> 02:32.042
Well, I'm gonna find
another team right now.

02:32.060 --> 02:33.560
Jimmy Jr.,
can I be on your team?

02:33.712 --> 02:37.714
Uh, we do still have
one spot open, so I guess,

02:37.807 --> 02:40.884
but didn't you just call this
a dumb, stupid cheese thing?

02:40.886 --> 02:44.646
No. I was talking about
a dumb, stupid grilled cheese

02:44.665 --> 02:45.906
I had the other day.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.501
Okay, uh, I guess, then,
you're on the team.

02:49.653 --> 02:51.503
[whispering] We're meeting
at Michael Carlish's house today

02:51.730 --> 02:54.581
after school to talk strategy
and practice throwing cheese.

02:54.733 --> 02:56.566
Cool. I will-will be there.

02:56.585 --> 02:57.676
Can't wait.

02:57.903 --> 02:59.011
But we need
to wrap up, like, 4:15

02:59.162 --> 03:00.921
'cause I have
a dentist appointment.

03:01.089 --> 03:02.088
-It's just a checkup.
-Got it.

03:02.183 --> 03:03.849
[Louise]
<i> Dang it, Tina's with her team</i>

03:04.000 --> 03:06.259
in a secret location
strategizing right now.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.835
I've never wanted
to switch bodies

03:07.930 --> 03:09.837
with a pubey teen girl more
in my life.

03:09.932 --> 03:12.632
She's in a secret location?
Is she a rave?

03:12.784 --> 03:13.917
-To-go order is up.
-Shh.

03:13.936 --> 03:15.194
-What?
-I'm eavesdropping.

03:15.421 --> 03:17.437
-Oh, no.
-Yeah, fighting couple,
table four.

03:17.589 --> 03:20.090
Well, then, you know what?
I think we should just break up.

03:20.183 --> 03:21.758
-[Linda gasps]
-[man] Is this because of Julie?

03:21.777 --> 03:23.927
-[woman] Julie?!
-Hmm. Julie.

03:23.946 --> 03:25.445
I'm moving in to hear more.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.705
No. No, Lin,
you're gonna blow it.

03:26.932 --> 03:28.448
-What are you talking about?
-Sorry.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.116
It's just, you're not doing
a very sneaky job

03:30.269 --> 03:31.618
-of eavesdropping.
-What?

03:31.712 --> 03:33.103
I'm fine. I'm a pro.

03:33.196 --> 03:34.862
It's out... it's outrageous.
That's what it is.

03:35.031 --> 03:37.624
It's ov... You've-you've
crossed a line here.

03:37.776 --> 03:39.776
What do you say we talk
about this somewhere else?

03:39.869 --> 03:41.778
-For sure.
-Bye.

03:41.871 --> 03:43.113
Thanks for coming.

03:43.131 --> 03:44.614
-[door opens, bell jingles]
-Lin, see?

03:44.633 --> 03:46.225
-[door closes]
-What? That wasn't 'cause of me.

03:46.376 --> 03:47.801
They left
'cause they wanted to talk

03:47.895 --> 03:49.394
about Julie outside in the sun.

03:49.654 --> 03:51.471
-Uh-huh.
-I'm a good eavesdropper.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.139
I mean, I love you, but--

03:53.234 --> 03:54.566
-What?
-You're not.

03:54.718 --> 03:55.400
-Yeah.
-It's true.
-Mm-mm.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.384
-No.
-Yup.

03:56.553 --> 03:57.569
-Yeah.
-Very true.

03:57.755 --> 03:58.979
But you're good
at dropping other things.

03:59.131 --> 04:01.389
Names, hints, eggs.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.149
Just now, you were doing
a bunch of things

04:03.302 --> 04:04.484
that were all bustable.

04:04.561 --> 04:06.578
Bustable? What was I doing
that was bustable?

04:06.730 --> 04:10.156
-Name one thing.
-Well, you were making a ton
of eye contact.

04:10.309 --> 04:11.232
I wouldn't say a ton.

04:11.326 --> 04:12.659
You wiped a hole in the counter.

04:12.828 --> 04:14.478
And at one point, the towel
wasn't even on the counter.

04:14.496 --> 04:16.404
You were just
kind of wiping air.

04:16.498 --> 04:19.091
-No.
-Lin, you made
active listening sounds.

04:19.318 --> 04:22.261
You stared right at them
and went, "Hmm. Julie."

04:22.488 --> 04:23.503
-Did I?
-Yeah.
-You did.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.763
-Mm-hmm.
-Damn it.

04:24.990 --> 04:26.080
But eavesdropping's
my favorite thing.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.674
What's the point
of having a restaurant

04:27.826 --> 04:28.934
if you can't eavesdrop?

04:29.085 --> 04:31.495
Look, maybe we can help you...
I think.

04:31.513 --> 04:34.606
We can teach you
how to be<i> not</i> so bad at it?

04:34.758 --> 04:36.308
[sighs]
Okay, fine.

04:36.460 --> 04:37.759
And then we'll teach you
how to flirt

04:37.778 --> 04:39.093
with the cook for free fries.

04:39.113 --> 04:40.353
-Mmm.
-[Bob] Mm.

04:40.506 --> 04:42.930
So we do
a motion offense-defense combo

04:42.950 --> 04:44.599
with three attackers
and two floaters.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.343
-Love it.
-Yeah, that makes sense.
-Yeah, totally.

04:46.436 --> 04:47.935
-What do you think, Tina?
-Oh. Sorry.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.029
Was that about the game?

04:49.123 --> 04:50.697
I thought
maybe you guys were talking

04:50.849 --> 04:52.032
about a movie you all saw.

04:52.126 --> 04:53.517
Should we do
some target practice?

04:53.535 --> 04:55.460
I brought practice cheese.
It's expired.

04:55.687 --> 04:57.187
My dad was all like,
"Go nuts with it."

04:57.205 --> 04:59.998
Great. I'm... gonna go pee.

05:00.150 --> 05:01.374
All right,
everyone aim for the chair.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.393
Michael, can we cheese
your handsome Adirondack?

05:03.453 --> 05:05.637
-Yeah, I think
it's cheese-proof.
-[grunts] Come on.

05:05.864 --> 05:08.381
-I feel good about that one.
Ha, all right.
-[grunts]

05:09.868 --> 05:12.035
Good God, I felt the wind
coming off that one!

05:12.128 --> 05:13.312
-Wow!
-[grunts]

05:13.463 --> 05:16.706
-[laughs] Nice tossing, Tex.
-[grunts]

05:16.800 --> 05:18.633
[Zeke]
Whoa! Killer Kelly!

05:18.727 --> 05:19.985
Coming from downtown!

05:20.136 --> 05:21.728
[laughs] The other teams
won't know what hit 'em.

05:21.880 --> 05:24.138
-What the?
-Do what?

05:24.232 --> 05:25.231
-Aah!
-[grunts]

05:25.384 --> 05:27.993
Oh, man, no! Not J-Ju, too!

05:28.162 --> 05:30.720
So that bathroom was<i> ocupado.</i>
I can go later.

05:30.739 --> 05:32.722
What... happened here?

05:32.741 --> 05:34.148
[grunts]
I don't understand.

05:34.242 --> 05:37.002
-I just...
I just don't understand.
-It was so quick.

05:37.229 --> 05:39.004
-We all got cheesed.
-Wait. Really?

05:39.231 --> 05:41.006
Someone cheesed all of us
from over the fence.

05:41.233 --> 05:42.674
Not all of us.

05:42.901 --> 05:45.068
-Take cover, T-dog!
-Aah!

05:45.087 --> 05:47.512
-Where are they?
-Maybe they're gone.

05:47.664 --> 05:49.163
Tina, they didn't get you.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.998
You're the last one alive
on our team.

05:51.093 --> 05:53.852
-You're our only hope.
-Cool. Cool, cool.

05:54.003 --> 05:57.564
I love the pressure.
Perfect. Yes, please.

06:01.436 --> 06:03.845
[Jimmy Jr.]<i> There we were,</i>
<i> a well-oiled, dominant team,</i>

06:03.939 --> 06:05.680
plus Tina,
talking winning strategy

06:05.699 --> 06:07.273
at our secret location.

06:07.426 --> 06:10.427
When out of nowhere, it was
like, thwap, thwap, thwap-thwap!

06:10.429 --> 06:13.354
We didn't even see who did it!
Four of us cheesed by a ghost!

06:13.374 --> 06:14.764
So impressive.

06:14.783 --> 06:16.190
And now it's all on Tina.

06:16.284 --> 06:17.601
The hopes and dreams
of our entire team.

06:17.694 --> 06:20.379
-Yup.
-All right, she's got it.
She's got it.

06:20.606 --> 06:22.547
-[laughs] Probably.
-Uh... maybe.

06:22.774 --> 06:24.198
-Um...
-Tina, are you okay?

06:24.292 --> 06:25.884
Sorry for your... loss?

06:26.035 --> 06:27.702
No, yeah.
I love that this happened.

06:27.829 --> 06:29.721
It was smart of the cheeser
to cheese us first.

06:29.798 --> 06:32.949
I mean, Zeke and I were some
of the top threats in the game.

06:32.968 --> 06:34.634
I can't believe
these beefy mitts will never get

06:34.728 --> 06:36.119
to work their magic.

06:36.138 --> 06:37.545
This cheeser must be a jock.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.806
Probably someone who plays
basketball or baseball.

06:39.958 --> 06:41.566
-Maybe Aiden Strider.
-Oh, yeah.

06:41.793 --> 06:43.050
Aiden's cute.

06:43.145 --> 06:44.569
Could be Brady Griffin.

06:44.721 --> 06:46.053
Brady's cute.

06:46.148 --> 06:48.632
T-dog, you got this?
'Cause your face kind of

06:48.650 --> 06:50.634
looks like you might not.
You all right?

06:50.727 --> 06:52.302
I don't... know.

06:52.362 --> 06:54.079
Uh, that's the spirit?

06:54.306 --> 06:56.898
-Um, Tina,
can I have a word with you?
-Sure?

06:56.992 --> 06:58.750
-Ow.
-Tina, listen to yourself.

06:58.902 --> 07:01.586
"I don't know." You're
the last one alive on your team!

07:01.738 --> 07:02.996
This is what we trained for.

07:03.148 --> 07:04.831
-If we had trained.
-You should have trained.

07:04.983 --> 07:08.075
-Uh-huh.
-Get... in... the... game.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.912
-Now who's my cheese warrior?
-Mm, me?

07:10.931 --> 07:12.747
-So intimidating.
-Ugh!

07:12.841 --> 07:14.658
[Bob]
<i> Okay. A big part</i>

07:14.751 --> 07:15.842
of successful eavesdropping

07:15.936 --> 07:17.844
is looking like
you're believably busy.

07:17.996 --> 07:19.663
And I don't mean,
like, wiping the counter.

07:19.681 --> 07:22.423
Wiping the counter is a big
giveaway that you're listening.

07:22.443 --> 07:24.668
-Total giveaway.
-Putting away clean cups.

07:24.686 --> 07:26.278
That's real, that's believable.

07:26.505 --> 07:29.448
Also, these need to be put away,
so we should do that.

07:29.599 --> 07:30.598
Yeah, okay.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.266
Another big part
of eavesdropping, Lin,

07:32.286 --> 07:34.344
a blank expression.
Look at me.

07:34.346 --> 07:35.845
Oh, yeah.
Look at those dead eyes.

07:35.864 --> 07:38.198
-Soulless.
-I don't...
I don't know about soulless.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.849
He looks like
a sad corpse, right?

07:39.868 --> 07:41.776
Let me try it. How's this?

07:41.870 --> 07:44.204
[Teddy]
Still pretty lively.
You have a lot of natural gusto.

07:44.356 --> 07:45.780
Bob doesn't have
to overcome that.

07:45.874 --> 07:47.207
Hmm.
Uh, how about a little drill?

07:47.359 --> 07:49.301
Lin, y-you stand over there
and put away the cups,

07:49.528 --> 07:52.286
and then we're gonna have a
really intriguing conversation,

07:52.455 --> 07:54.639
and you will try
to eavesdrop on us without,

07:54.791 --> 07:56.641
you know, doing the stuff
you normally do.

07:56.793 --> 07:58.643
-Hmm.
-So, I'm, uh...

07:58.795 --> 08:00.812
I'm embezzling money
from the company.

08:00.964 --> 08:02.814
What? Are you serious
right now, Bob?

08:03.041 --> 08:04.983
-[Linda] Hmm.
-Lin, you just "hmm-ed."

08:05.210 --> 08:06.392
Oh, shush. No, I didn't.

08:06.545 --> 08:07.819
That was about something else.

08:08.046 --> 08:09.321
It's an interesting cup
I was putting away.

08:09.397 --> 08:11.490
-Keep going. I got this.
-Okay.

08:11.717 --> 08:13.808
How does embezzling work, Bob?
I've never understood it.

08:13.902 --> 08:16.569
Like, which one's embezzling
and which one's bedazzling?

08:16.663 --> 08:17.829
Linda, y-you can't move closer.

08:18.056 --> 08:20.223
Oh, yeah.
What you got to do is figure out

08:20.242 --> 08:22.742
the maximum distance you can be
from the conversation

08:22.836 --> 08:24.077
and then stay in that zone.

08:24.153 --> 08:26.062
Right, right.
Okay, you keep talking.

08:26.081 --> 08:28.006
And what's racketeering?
Is that like pickleball?

08:28.157 --> 08:30.175
-Oh, speak up.
-No.
-Can't say that.

08:30.402 --> 08:31.843
-Number one rule, really.
-Yeah.

08:31.995 --> 08:34.921
Look, I've done some thinking,
a little strategizing.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.589
And I actually think
there's a way

08:36.683 --> 08:38.258
you can win this thing maybe.

08:38.352 --> 08:39.926
Here's the plan.
For the first few days,

08:40.078 --> 08:42.354
you lay low, let these
other bozos cheese each other.

08:42.581 --> 08:44.856
Uh, okay.
Lay low. I could do that.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.507
Um, l-like how?

08:46.601 --> 08:49.085
Well, school is a safe zone,
so you could just stick around

08:49.178 --> 08:51.604
after school and go
to an after-school activity.

08:51.757 --> 08:53.590
Go to... Chess Club.

08:53.608 --> 08:54.941
But I'm not in Chess Club.

08:55.093 --> 08:57.443
Are you saying "chest club"?
I should join.

08:57.520 --> 08:58.519
Exhibit A and B.

08:58.688 --> 09:00.597
Gene, shush.
And you'll stay after school

09:00.615 --> 09:01.856
<i> for 45 to 65 minutes.</i>

09:01.875 --> 09:03.116
<i> And when you leave school,</i>

09:03.210 --> 09:05.192
<i> switch up</i>
<i> your appearance a little.</i>

09:05.212 --> 09:06.786
<i>Grab a hat from lost and found.</i>

09:06.863 --> 09:09.272
[Gene]
<i> Check for lice!</i>
<i>No, don't. Keep it interesting.</i>

09:09.291 --> 09:11.608
[Louise]
<i> And you'll leave out</i>
<i> of a different exit each day.</i>

09:11.626 --> 09:13.943
<i> Then, under no circumstances</i>
<i> do you go home.</i>

09:14.037 --> 09:17.113
<i>Cheesers are gonna be expecting</i>
<i> you anywhere along the route</i>

09:17.206 --> 09:20.784
<i> from school to our apartment,</i>
<i> so you go somewhere else.</i>

09:20.786 --> 09:22.710
<i> You don't run,</i>
<i> but you move quickly.</i>

09:22.729 --> 09:25.138
<i> Today it's gonna be the hair</i>
<i> salon where Gretchen works.</i>

09:25.232 --> 09:27.123
<i> Stay at the salon.</i>
<i> Read some magazines.</i>

09:27.142 --> 09:29.067
[Gene]
<i> You know, a blowout</i>
<i> wouldn't kill you.</i>

09:29.218 --> 09:30.902
[Louise]
<i> And then, at 6:00, when</i>
<i> the cheesing hours are over,</i>

09:31.129 --> 09:33.238
<i> you head home</i>
<i> and live to fight another day.</i>

09:33.465 --> 09:35.389
<i> Then you get to do it</i>
<i> all over again tomorrow.</i>

09:35.409 --> 09:37.409
[Tina]
<i> Got it. I think. I hope.</i>

09:37.560 --> 09:39.077
<i> Um, can you say it</i>
<i> two more times?</i>

09:39.228 --> 09:41.805

Aiden got Big Cheesed.
Ronald got Big Cheesed.

10:04.512 --> 10:06.496
Katie, Josh,
both got Big Cheesed.

10:06.514 --> 10:08.106
And we still don't know
who it is.

10:08.333 --> 10:09.774
I mean, they've never been seen.

10:10.001 --> 10:12.277
Striking from the shadows
like an angel of death.

10:12.428 --> 10:14.279
It's unprecedented.
Oh, but, uh, also,

10:14.356 --> 10:17.148
uh, you got this, Tina.
You can totally stay alive.

10:17.375 --> 10:19.951
Yeah. Are you getting enough
sleep, Tina? Enough protein?

10:20.103 --> 10:21.786
Here, eat this.
It's a chicken nugget.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.270
-Oh. Thanks.
-Stay strong!

10:23.365 --> 10:25.398
-You're our only hope!
-The Big Cheese.

10:25.550 --> 10:28.034
The Big Cheese.
Changing the whole game.

10:28.186 --> 10:30.128
They don't celebrate,
they don't get into fling-offs.

10:30.279 --> 10:31.537
They're above all that.

10:31.690 --> 10:33.298
They're a technician.
They're a visionary.

10:33.449 --> 10:35.041
Was this supposed
to be a pep talk for me?

10:35.193 --> 10:38.528
Oh. Yeah, but, uh,
you can totally beat them.

10:38.621 --> 10:41.122
-Oh, good.
-So who is the Big Cheese?

10:41.290 --> 10:43.049
Could be Will.
He's athletic.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.309
Yeah, look how he chews.

10:44.460 --> 10:46.386
-Effortless.
-Could be Chelsea.

10:46.538 --> 10:47.479
I mean, this is so Chelsea.

10:47.706 --> 10:49.296
She would probably
throw cheese at people

10:49.316 --> 10:50.815
even if this game
wasn't happening.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.877
But you also got to wonder
about sneaky Henry Haber.

10:53.970 --> 10:55.302
Or Jocelyn? Nah.

10:55.397 --> 10:58.047
Tammy? She's an evil mastermind.

10:58.108 --> 11:00.307
Well, she's evil at least.
Sam?

11:00.360 --> 11:02.494
Eh, nervous, clumsy, but...

11:02.721 --> 11:06.647
I've seen him throw a Frisbee.
Not terrible. So, maybe?

11:06.741 --> 11:08.149
What about Susmita?

11:08.168 --> 11:10.669
[Tina]
She is kinda someone
no one would suspect.

11:10.896 --> 11:13.563
Brainiac on the worksheets,
master cheeser on the streets?

11:13.581 --> 11:16.341
And she does really want to win
this dumb game that has,

11:16.568 --> 11:18.568
let's face it,
torn our friendship apart.

11:18.586 --> 11:20.679
I mean, I kinda
wouldn't mind winning

11:20.830 --> 11:22.238
just to shove it
in Susmita's face.

11:22.331 --> 11:23.848
Like so much cheese.

11:24.075 --> 11:25.350
Maybe I can win with this thing
with a hiding strategy.

11:25.501 --> 11:26.851
I'm getting pretty good at it.

11:27.003 --> 11:29.262
I had some fun banter with
the lady at the vitamin store.

11:29.414 --> 11:30.580
-Oh, no. No more hiding.
-What?

11:30.598 --> 11:32.432
But hiding's great.
I like hiding.

11:32.584 --> 11:35.509
No, no. It's time.
Time to shift strategy.

11:35.529 --> 11:37.011
Look, when you're
playing dodgeball,

11:37.105 --> 11:38.438
it's smart to hide
in the back for a while.

11:38.590 --> 11:40.606
But no one wins
dodgeball by only hiding.

11:40.759 --> 11:42.200
You got to knock people out.
There aren't many kids

11:42.427 --> 11:44.536
left in the game.
It's time to activate...

11:44.705 --> 11:46.095
cheese mode.

11:46.114 --> 11:48.097
-Ooh.
-Cheese mode?
What's cheese mode?

11:48.116 --> 11:49.374
It means
you're on the attack now.

11:49.601 --> 11:51.100
You seek out targets,
and when you find a target,

11:51.119 --> 11:52.693
you figure out
a way to put cheese on it.

11:52.713 --> 11:56.105
And you go search and destroy,
you go scary beast.

11:56.124 --> 11:57.957
I don't think I can go
scary beast.

11:58.109 --> 11:59.217
What about scary yeast?

11:59.368 --> 12:00.610
You know I'm not
a good cheese thrower.

12:00.628 --> 12:02.887
Tina, trust me,
you're thinking too much.

12:03.039 --> 12:05.557
Take your brain and
push it towards your butt.

12:05.708 --> 12:07.166
Okay, uh-huh...

12:07.227 --> 12:08.893
I was gonna do that after lunch.

12:09.120 --> 12:09.786
You're gonna use the old

12:09.804 --> 12:11.212
<i> Circle Back Attack.</i>

12:11.231 --> 12:15.400
<i> You get someone to follow you,</i>
<i> then flip the script.</i>

12:15.627 --> 12:16.884
-Aah!
-Aah!

12:16.903 --> 12:17.794
[grunts]

12:17.963 --> 12:19.720
-Damn it. Hold on.
-[grunts]

12:19.814 --> 12:21.222
-[both straining]
-Unpeel!

12:21.241 --> 12:22.465
Hold on, don't go anywhere.

12:22.484 --> 12:23.983
Aah!

12:24.110 --> 12:26.819
What? No!

12:26.972 --> 12:29.305
Yes. Circle Back Attack.
Scary beast.

12:29.324 --> 12:31.307
Don't you dare
call me a scary beast.

12:31.326 --> 12:32.584
No, I'm the scary beast.

12:32.811 --> 12:34.568
You're just
a cheeseball who got cheesed

12:34.588 --> 12:35.995
in the face. So eat it.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.997
I mean, don't literally eat it,
it's on the ground.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.466
But you know what I mean.

12:43.412 --> 12:45.287
[Tina]
<i>I can't believe I cheesed Tammy.</i>
<i> In her face!</i>

12:45.289 --> 12:48.174
I mean, literally in her face,
'cause I hit her in her face.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.434
Yeah, Tina, it's one person.

12:49.585 --> 12:51.344
I like the spirit,
but stay focused.

12:51.496 --> 12:52.937
We got a lot more work to do.

12:53.164 --> 12:54.773
And you were so worried
about throwing your cheese.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.441
I'm proud of you, I-I think.

12:56.668 --> 12:58.443
-Thanks, guys.
-So, Tina, this is a list

12:58.594 --> 13:00.503
of everyone
who's still in the game,

13:00.522 --> 13:01.613
aka your targets.

13:01.764 --> 13:02.614
You gonna cheese 'em?

13:02.841 --> 13:03.856
Hell yeah, I'm gonna cheese 'em!

13:04.009 --> 13:05.024
Could someone pass me a roll?

13:05.176 --> 13:06.342
-[Tina grunts]
-Oh!

13:06.435 --> 13:07.452
-Whoa.
-Hello.
-Hoo-boy!

13:07.603 --> 13:08.953
Sorry, sorry.
I'll take it down a notch.

Henry, Chelsea and Will?

13:24.638 --> 13:27.213
The Big Cheese has got
to be Chelsea or Will, right?

13:27.382 --> 13:29.048
The girl who sharpens
her fingernails or the guy

13:29.200 --> 13:31.034
who can kick a kickball

13:31.127 --> 13:34.537

needed to say "psst"

-But okay.

<i> Henry.</i>

13:46.309 --> 13:48.051
Huh. That sounds weird.

13:48.069 --> 13:49.052
And like a trap?

13:49.145 --> 13:50.903
Oh, definitely weird and a trap.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.647
But if you play this right,
you could cheese

13:53.667 --> 13:55.834
everyone there and win
the whole stinking game today.

13:55.910 --> 13:58.244
-Or I get cheesed.
-Or you get cheesed.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.338
I think that's exactly what
they said to each other

14:00.565 --> 14:02.582
before they stormed
the beaches of Normandy.

14:02.734 --> 14:06.235
She's probably at the abandoned
dog food factory by now.

14:06.329 --> 14:08.662
Oh, boy, I hope she brought
enough cheese slices.

14:08.682 --> 14:12.075
I hope she brings some home.
I miss what cheese used to be.

14:12.093 --> 14:14.577
Guys, that's
the breakup couple, right?

14:14.596 --> 14:16.020
[gasps]
It is.

14:16.247 --> 14:17.263
[Louise] That's definitely
the breakup couple.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.356
[Gene]
It's a double-burger breakup.

14:18.583 --> 14:20.266
[Teddy]
Are they coming back in?

14:20.418 --> 14:22.360
Why would they come ba...
Hi, welcome to Bob's Burgers.

14:22.587 --> 14:24.654
Can we get some menus
over here for these guys?

14:28.869 --> 14:30.943
-Uh, hi?
-[Henry] Uh, welcome.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.037
Go ahead and take cover
if you want.

14:33.189 --> 14:35.039
Uh, what do we, uh...?

14:35.191 --> 14:37.617
[Henry] Okay, uh, I just
realized it's really hard

14:37.711 --> 14:38.768
to start a secret meeting

14:38.786 --> 14:40.712
if you can't see who's here.

14:40.863 --> 14:42.863
-So, is everybody here?
-Yeah.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.549
-Yes.
-Yep.
-Yep.

14:44.776 --> 14:46.275
-Present.
-Anyway, uh,

14:46.294 --> 14:48.277
this is everyone left
in the game.

14:48.371 --> 14:50.279
One of you is the Big Cheese,

14:50.298 --> 14:51.872
and I know who it is,

14:52.041 --> 14:54.634
and her name rhymes
with Rusrita.

14:54.786 --> 14:56.302
Okay, that's a start.

14:56.454 --> 14:57.286
Wait, what?

14:57.288 --> 14:59.622
Guys, I'm not the Big Cheese.

14:59.715 --> 15:01.307
No, no, no, it's definitely her.

15:01.459 --> 15:03.626
O-One time during
the three weeks and two days

15:03.719 --> 15:06.646
that we dated, I saw her flick
an index card into the trash

15:06.740 --> 15:09.741
from halfway across the room
with perfect accuracy.

15:09.968 --> 15:12.410
Also, we played badminton once,
and she was a monster.

15:12.561 --> 15:14.303
Wait, so whether it's her
or not,

15:14.397 --> 15:15.655
why did you bring us all here?

15:15.807 --> 15:16.639
What's the plan?

15:16.824 --> 15:18.474
I have that same
question as well.

15:18.567 --> 15:20.734
Everyone's familiar with
the Battle of Red Cliffs

15:20.754 --> 15:22.403
in second-century China, right?

15:22.497 --> 15:23.829
-[Chelsea] No.
-[Tina] Huh?
-[Susmita] No.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.406
Well, surely, you're familiar

15:25.425 --> 15:26.740
with the game theory concept

15:26.760 --> 15:29.335
-"targeted coalition"?
-[all] No.

15:29.487 --> 15:32.155
Look, the only way for any of
us mere mortals to have a chance

15:32.173 --> 15:34.657
at winning is to take out
the Big Cheese first.

15:34.750 --> 15:38.327
Otherwise she takes us all out,
and our chances go down to zero.

15:38.421 --> 15:40.087
[Susmita]
Again, I'm not the Big Cheese!

15:40.106 --> 15:42.941
People, Henry obviously got
everyone here

15:43.168 --> 15:45.685
in one place
so he could cheese everyone.

15:45.837 --> 15:49.021
Maybe 'cause, oh, I don't
know,<i> he's</i> the Big Cheese?

15:49.174 --> 15:51.674
Flattered. The mental part,
capable. Sure.

15:51.693 --> 15:52.951
The physical part, not so much.

15:53.178 --> 15:54.844
So, what we're saying is,

15:54.862 --> 15:57.013
now we're all here in
this abandoned dog food factory

15:57.106 --> 15:59.682
with the Big Cheese,
but we don't know who it is.

15:59.775 --> 16:00.850
It's Susmita!

16:00.868 --> 16:04.445
-It's Henry!
-Aah! I got cheesed.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.205
[Tina] Oh, man.
Hey, you didn't by any chance

16:06.299 --> 16:08.449
happen to see who threw it,
did you? Probably not.

16:08.526 --> 16:09.950
You would have mentioned it,
I'm guessing,

16:10.044 --> 16:11.260
so, yeah, forget it.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.200
[Tina]
So, Will, about who cheesed you,

16:17.218 --> 16:18.792
anything?
Anything you saw at all?

16:18.886 --> 16:20.645
Direction it came from? Sounds?
Grunts?

16:20.814 --> 16:22.538
No. It happened so fast.

16:22.631 --> 16:25.299
I-I didn't see anything,
I didn't even hear anything.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.727
Oh, just curious,
were you the Big Cheese?

16:27.821 --> 16:28.987
Thanks for the compliment,
but no,

16:29.063 --> 16:31.714
-I'm not the Big Cheese.
-[loud panting]

16:31.733 --> 16:33.992
[Chelsea] Okay, who's panting?
'Cause it's grossing me out.

16:34.143 --> 16:35.735
Sorry, yeah, that's me.
This is, uh...

16:35.829 --> 16:37.144
This is all... I'm anxious,

16:37.163 --> 16:38.663
so it's giving me,
like, a tiny panic attack,

16:38.814 --> 16:39.980
but it's-it's really
no big deal.

16:40.074 --> 16:42.316
Uh, please carry on.
It is all gravy, baby.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.501
Sorry I said that.

16:43.728 --> 16:46.504
You know, it's very possible
that it's Chelsea.

16:46.581 --> 16:48.673
She gets in trouble a lot.
She's a risk-taker.

16:48.900 --> 16:51.342
A thrill-seeker. She pierced
her nose with a thumbtack.

16:51.569 --> 16:53.586
Yeah, that has
nothing to do with throwing

16:53.680 --> 16:54.920
cheese from hidden places.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.347
Just saying,
that logic is flawed.

16:56.499 --> 16:58.832
And it wasn't a thumbtack.
It was a paper clip.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.593
-[Henry] Ow.
-[Tina] Ugh.
-What about Tina?

17:00.745 --> 17:04.022
Maybe she cheesed her whole
team to throw us all off.

17:04.098 --> 17:06.024
I kinda love that.
I wish I did that.

17:06.100 --> 17:08.860
Uh, I'm 99% sure
I'm not the Big Cheese.

17:09.087 --> 17:10.486
So, yeah.

17:11.756 --> 17:15.107
Oops, I dropped my gum.
Susmita, you like gum.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.276
You-you can go ahead
and take that if you want.

17:17.428 --> 17:22.206
-It's got extra flavor crystals.
-I'm good, thank you.

17:22.358 --> 17:25.001
Aah! Aw, dang it, I'm out!

17:25.861 --> 17:27.211
Frig.
You got me.

17:27.438 --> 17:29.105
[Sam]
Wow. Nice shot.

17:29.198 --> 17:32.216
[Chelsea]
Okay, I just want to tell
everyone, I was the Big Cheese.

17:32.368 --> 17:34.701
-[Tina] Really?
-[Chelsea] No. Maybe.

17:34.796 --> 17:36.220
-No, not me.
-Was it you, Henry?

17:36.447 --> 17:37.704
No. Like I said in my note.

17:37.799 --> 17:40.725
You know, I ran so
many simulations of the way this

17:40.876 --> 17:44.303
would go down, and none of
them were this unsatisfactory.

17:44.455 --> 17:45.805
Gum with flavor crystals?

17:45.957 --> 17:47.273
-Yeah, I'll take that.
-Oh...

17:47.458 --> 17:50.693
[Tina]
I would also like gum,
eventually. Just saying.

17:51.646 --> 17:52.812
Nothing. I got nothing.

17:52.964 --> 17:54.146
I think they're speaking French.

17:54.299 --> 17:56.074
Or very quiet English.

17:56.225 --> 17:57.224
It can't be done.

17:57.318 --> 17:58.725
-Impossible.
-They're good.

17:58.745 --> 17:59.911
They're very good.

18:00.138 --> 18:02.471
I guess we should
give them their privacy.

18:02.490 --> 18:03.489
Don't you say that.

18:03.566 --> 18:04.974
Don't even think it.
I'm going in.

18:04.992 --> 18:06.158
-No, no, no.
-No.
-No, don't do it.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.503
I can do this.
I'm ready.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.481
They didn't stop talking.
That's good.

18:12.483 --> 18:14.258
She's found
her maximum distance.

18:14.410 --> 18:16.577
She's got the dead eyes,
she's got 'em.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.096
And a dead leg somehow?

18:18.247 --> 18:20.264

-[Sam] Yeah?

18:20.416 --> 18:22.508
-[Tina] Susmita?
-[Susmita] Yeah?

18:22.660 --> 18:23.750
Hi, um,

18:23.845 --> 18:25.177
I guess we're
the last ones left?

18:25.330 --> 18:27.179
-I guess.
-Geez, Tina.

18:27.332 --> 18:28.589
I would have teamed up with you

18:28.608 --> 18:30.424
if I'd known
you were gonna make it this far.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.443
Look at you.
You're pretty good at this.

18:32.670 --> 18:34.019
Thanks.
I kinda surprised myself.

18:34.172 --> 18:35.671
I guess I didn't think
I was gonna be any good

18:35.690 --> 18:38.174
and then I think
that kind of made me not good?

18:38.192 --> 18:41.119
Also, just to say it,
you don't have to be good

18:41.270 --> 18:42.269
at something to have fun.

18:42.363 --> 18:44.347
