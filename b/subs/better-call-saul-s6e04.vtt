41:20.061 --> 41:21.520
Bad day, huh?

41:22.897 --> 41:25.817
No. It was a great day.

41:25.817 --> 41:28.527
With actual paying clients.

41:28.527 --> 41:29.988
The word is out.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.115
People were throwing

41:29.988 --> 41:32.115
cash retainers at me

41:32.115 --> 41:34.951
just to say Saul Goodman

41:32.115 --> 41:34.951
is their lawyer.

41:36.577 --> 41:38.704
Because of who you represented.

41:40.165 --> 41:42.667
Well, I mean,

41:40.165 --> 41:42.667
that's part of it.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.794
But, um, the bottom line is

41:44.794 --> 41:48.131
I need a new place

41:44.794 --> 41:48.131
to do business, pronto.

41:48.131 --> 41:51.634
Now, this place is a shithole,

41:48.131 --> 41:51.634
but the price is right.

41:51.634 --> 41:54.720
And I think I can talk the

41:51.634 --> 41:54.720
landlord into a month-to-month.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.473
So it's temporary.

41:56.473 --> 41:58.475
You know, until I find

41:56.473 --> 41:58.475
something better.

41:58.475 --> 41:59.851
[SIGHS]

42:02.687 --> 42:03.771
Hey.

42:04.814 --> 42:05.982
What do you think?

42:12.780 --> 42:14.032
It's small.

42:15.658 --> 42:18.244
It's dirty.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.414
And this whole place

42:19.620 --> 42:21.414
smells funny.

42:25.751 --> 42:28.713
But the courthouse

42:25.751 --> 42:28.713
is five blocks away.

42:28.713 --> 42:32.175
You can't get to MDC

42:28.713 --> 42:32.175
without driving past.

42:32.175 --> 42:36.221
Parking is good.

42:32.175 --> 42:36.221
Bail bond row isn't far, and...

42:38.097 --> 42:40.266
Taco Cabeza

42:38.097 --> 42:40.266
is just around the corner.

42:42.018 --> 42:43.853
Might be a diamond

42:42.018 --> 42:43.853
in the rough.

42:48.400 --> 42:49.817
Just promise me...

42:51.861 --> 42:53.488
you won't move the toilet.

42:56.157 --> 42:57.950
[CHUCKLES]

42:57.950 --> 42:59.702
There it is. All right.

43:00.537 --> 43:01.871
Um...

43:01.871 --> 43:03.622
Speaking of Taco Cabeza...

43:03.622 --> 43:05.291
I'm starving. Let's do it.

43:26.771 --> 43:29.566
