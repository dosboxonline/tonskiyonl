00:49.177 --> 00:53.013
 I've been searching
for a long time 

00:53.181 --> 00:57.936
 To find someone to be mine 

00:58.103 --> 01:03.273
 I never thought
you'd come along 

01:03.441 --> 01:06.944
 Now that you're here,
all my worries are gone 

01:07.112 --> 01:08.946
 Oh 

01:09.114 --> 01:13.741
 Sweet you 

01:13.909 --> 01:18.121
 All of my dreams
have all come true 

01:18.288 --> 01:27.921
 You're just the one
I've been looking for 

01:28.089 --> 01:32.467
 I didn't know
how long it would take 

01:32.635 --> 01:37.096
 But good things
come to those who wait 

01:37.264 --> 01:41.976
 Now I can't ask
for anything more 

01:42.144 --> 01:47.314
 You're everything
I've been looking for 

01:47.482 --> 01:51.985
 Sweet you 

01:52.153 --> 01:56.698
 Nobody, nobody,
nobody will ever do 

01:56.866 --> 02:06.081
 You're just the one
I've been looking for 

02:06.249 --> 02:08.667
 Nights were dark 

02:08.835 --> 02:11.170
 Days got longer 

02:11.337 --> 02:15.298
 My mind was weak,
but my heart stayed strong 

02:15.465 --> 02:19.802
 Then you came along
and rescued me 

02:19.970 --> 02:24.558
 Please, don't ever set me free 

02:24.726 --> 02:27.643
 Oh, no 

02:32.357 --> 02:35.026
 Oh 

02:35.194 --> 02:39.780
 Sweet you 

02:39.948 --> 02:44.535
 Nobody, nobody,
nobody will ever do 

02:44.703 --> 02:54.211
 You're just the one
I've been looking for 

02:54.378 --> 02:56.630
 Nights were dark 

02:56.797 --> 02:59.132
 Days got longer 

02:59.300 --> 03:03.637
 My mind was weak,
but my heart stayed strong 

03:03.804 --> 03:07.890
 Then you came along
and rescued me 

03:08.058 --> 03:12.603
 Please, don't ever set me free 

03:12.771 --> 03:15.814
 Oh, no 

03:20.236 --> 03:23.112
 Oh 

03:23.280 --> 03:24.322
 Sweet you... 

03:24.490 --> 03:26.824
Synedyne Technical Support.
This is Suzanne. How can I help you?

03:26.992 --> 03:29.953
Synedyne Technical Support.
This is Rachel. How can I help you?

03:30.120 --> 03:33.163
This is Elliot.
How can I help you?

03:33.331 --> 03:35.916
Oh, wow.

03:36.084 --> 03:38.877
Yeah, okay.
Give me a second to find you here.

03:39.045 --> 03:41.171
My computer's running
a little slow today.

03:41.339 --> 03:43.632
Wake up, fella.
There you are.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.008
Hey, you got yourself
a model 5732.

03:46.176 --> 03:48.594
128 megs of RAM,
27 gig hard drive.

03:48.762 --> 03:52.181
Good. Good. And you say that
it hangs every time you print?

03:52.349 --> 03:54.725
Wow!
All right, no problem.

03:54.893 --> 03:57.435
Can you hold for two seconds?

03:57.603 --> 03:59.312
Carol! Carol.

04:01.148 --> 04:02.691
I don't know what
you've been told, little lady,

04:02.858 --> 04:05.110
but the rest of us start at nine.

04:07.613 --> 04:09.197
Kidding, I'm just kidding.
Good morning.

04:09.365 --> 04:11.991
Hey, Dan, my man!
What's up, my bro?

04:12.158 --> 04:15.244
Yeah, put it there!
All right. Yeah.

04:15.412 --> 04:18.497
So hoops today? You and the guys
up for some hoopage after work?

04:18.665 --> 04:21.083
Uh, you know,
we don't know yet, Elliot.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.793
- I'm not sure yet, okay?
- That's cool. Just let me know.

04:23.961 --> 04:26.296
'Cause I'm there, bud. That's right,
'cause I love the round ball.

04:26.463 --> 04:29.091
That's why they call me "Air Elliot."

04:30.802 --> 04:32.803
- Yeah!
- Okay.

04:32.971 --> 04:35.264
Make sure that you
let me know the right time

04:35.432 --> 04:36.806
because last week you said 6:30

04:36.974 --> 04:38.641
and when I got there,
you guys were just leaving.

04:38.809 --> 04:41.102
I mean, how stupid did you feel?

04:41.270 --> 04:43.313
Pretty stupid, Elliot.

04:43.480 --> 04:45.648
Not a problem, Danny.
Give it up.

04:45.816 --> 04:47.984
- Hey, Daniel.
- Hey, man, how you doing?

04:48.152 --> 04:49.735
Good, good.
How you doing, man?

04:52.822 --> 04:54.823
Hey, Bob!

04:54.991 --> 04:56.992
- What's up?
- Hey, Elliot.

04:57.160 --> 05:00.037
You and your posse
gonna hit the brewery tonight?

05:00.204 --> 05:02.288
My "posse"?
No.

05:02.456 --> 05:05.708
Uh, they're all busy with the big...

05:05.876 --> 05:07.835
- What's with your neck?
- Oh, nothing.

05:08.003 --> 05:11.672
It's a repetitive stress disorder.
It's a headset injury.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.090
So what do you say you and me
go and knock back some suds

05:14.258 --> 05:15.508
and check out the babes?

05:15.676 --> 05:18.094
Elliot, I'm married, remember?

05:18.262 --> 05:20.680
I'm gonna go home,
spend some time with my wife.

05:20.848 --> 05:22.015
Oh.

05:22.183 --> 05:25.435
Taking a trip to Whipville.

05:28.188 --> 05:30.731
It just gets funnier
every time you do that.

05:33.360 --> 05:34.568
Don't, don't, don't...

05:34.736 --> 05:36.028
Hey, Jerry!

05:36.196 --> 05:39.281
Jerry, Jerry, bo-berry,
fee-fi-fo-ferry, Jerry!

05:39.448 --> 05:40.865
Hey, what's happening, brother?

05:41.033 --> 05:42.867
- Running to an important meeting.
- Oh, yeah.

05:43.035 --> 05:44.035
- Yeah.
- Hey, wait.

05:44.203 --> 05:45.787
No, I think you're gonna
appreciate this,

05:45.954 --> 05:47.705
because we're both a couple
of stereo component nuts.

05:47.873 --> 05:49.749
Check these out, holmes.
These are the new Ingebritzens.

05:49.917 --> 05:51.125
- Right.
- XVC speakers.

05:51.293 --> 05:53.293
Here, look it.
That's the back of the left speaker

05:53.461 --> 05:55.170
and the front of the right speaker.

05:55.338 --> 05:56.671
Sweet, sweet, sweet.

05:56.839 --> 05:58.965
That's the front of the left...
no, that's the right...

06:06.390 --> 06:07.890
I think... oh, man!

06:08.058 --> 06:09.892
- What?
- It's Elliot.

06:10.060 --> 06:11.310
Who told him we were here?

06:11.478 --> 06:14.021
- Oh, shit.
- Did you tell him we were here?

06:19.069 --> 06:20.569
Hi!

06:22.155 --> 06:24.198
You guys!

06:24.366 --> 06:25.908
I told you not to...

06:26.076 --> 06:29.286
Well, well, well,
isn't this a big surprise?

06:29.454 --> 06:31.079
I thought everybody was busy.

06:31.247 --> 06:32.956
A slight change of plans, Elliot.

06:33.124 --> 06:35.208
Oh, is that right?

06:35.376 --> 06:37.293
Well, I'm a little bit peeved
at you guys.

06:37.461 --> 06:40.713
I'm thinking you tried to ditch me.
I might not even sit down with you.

06:40.881 --> 06:43.174
We can certainly understand that,
so we'll see you tomorrow.

06:43.342 --> 06:46.051
- Later, Elliot.
- I'm kidding!

06:46.219 --> 06:47.845
- Switch places with me.
- No, I'm fine.

06:57.604 --> 06:59.564
- What?
- Oh, my goodness gracious.

06:59.731 --> 07:01.065
You've gotta be kidding!

07:01.233 --> 07:02.943
Please, please, don't tell me

07:03.111 --> 07:04.611
that you have a thing for Alison
Gardner.

07:04.779 --> 07:05.904
- Oh, man!
- Please.

07:06.072 --> 07:08.115
She's way out of your league.

07:08.283 --> 07:10.908
Isn't she dating that guy in research?

07:11.076 --> 07:12.326
Brian, with the teeth.

07:12.494 --> 07:14.287
Brian?
The guy with the teeth.

07:14.455 --> 07:16.789
No, that's been over
for three months now.

07:16.957 --> 07:21.335
- Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
- I know a lot of things about her.

07:21.503 --> 07:24.045
I know that she likes her bagels
buttered, but not toasted.

07:24.213 --> 07:26.006
- Wow.
- How specific.

07:26.174 --> 07:28.758
I know that she looks beautiful
in any color,

07:28.926 --> 07:31.803
but when she wears blue...

07:31.971 --> 07:35.473
Sounds like you guys
are old friends?

07:35.640 --> 07:36.932
Well, we have been
working together

07:37.100 --> 07:39.310
at the same company
for four years.

07:39.478 --> 07:41.645
You spend time together,
people get to know each other.

07:41.813 --> 07:43.647
It's true,
so it should be no problem

07:43.815 --> 07:45.941
for you to just get up,
walk over there, and say hello.

07:46.109 --> 07:48.276
She's with somebody.
I'll catch up with her tomorrow.

07:48.444 --> 07:50.570
- Come on!
- Hold on, Elliot.

07:50.738 --> 07:51.946
Come clean here.

07:52.114 --> 07:55.200
You have never spoken
to Alison Gardner, right?

07:55.367 --> 07:56.493
Of course I have.

07:56.660 --> 08:01.288
- Did I say "queer" earlier?
- You are pathetic, Elliot! Really.

08:01.456 --> 08:04.209
Okay, I guess you guys are just
not gonna let me relax tonight

08:04.376 --> 08:05.668
until I go over there and say hello.

08:05.836 --> 08:06.920
- I guess not.
- Yeah.

08:07.087 --> 08:10.507
Well, if that'll make you happy.
You think I'm pathetic.

08:12.801 --> 08:14.968
- Don't touch me.
- Go for it, tiger.

08:15.136 --> 08:16.178
Good luck.

08:25.021 --> 08:27.563
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:27.731 --> 08:28.814
Do I know you?

08:28.982 --> 08:31.234
Oh, I should hope so.

08:31.401 --> 08:34.695
We've only been working together
at Synedyne for the last four years.

08:34.863 --> 08:37.698
I'm Elliot Richards.

08:37.866 --> 08:39.032
We've spoken.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.659
I'm sorry, I don't...

08:41.827 --> 08:44.704
It was the first week of June,
three years ago.

08:44.872 --> 08:47.290
I said it was wet out.

08:47.458 --> 08:50.710
We were standing in the lobby,
and I said it was really wet out.

08:50.878 --> 08:53.045
It was raining at the time.

08:53.213 --> 08:54.713
I assume that.

08:56.258 --> 08:57.258
Yeah.

09:01.054 --> 09:04.222
So here we are, talking again.

09:04.390 --> 09:05.640
Yeah.

09:08.519 --> 09:09.769
Well, take it easy.

09:16.026 --> 09:19.194
I'm here with friends
and I was wondering if you wanted...

09:34.126 --> 09:38.212
Dear God, I would give anything
to have that girl in my life.

10:20.754 --> 10:23.713
- Hi.
- Hello.

10:23.881 --> 10:25.298
I was wondering...

10:25.466 --> 10:27.175
if this is...

10:28.802 --> 10:31.971
I was standing over there and...

10:32.139 --> 10:36.224
You're very glib.
I bet you're a whiz with the ladies.

10:36.392 --> 10:38.477
- Well...
- You here alone?

10:38.645 --> 10:40.020
No!

10:40.188 --> 10:42.356
I'm here with
some buddies from work.

10:42.523 --> 10:45.567
I saw you talking to a woman.

10:45.735 --> 10:48.819
Yeah, but I'm not with her.

10:48.987 --> 10:51.489
But you'd like to be, huh?

10:51.657 --> 10:53.407
What makes you say that?

10:53.575 --> 10:54.825
I don't know.

10:54.993 --> 10:56.661
When a man says
he'd give anything

10:56.828 --> 10:58.329
to have a certain woman in his life,

10:58.497 --> 11:00.288
I just assume
she means something to him.

11:00.456 --> 11:02.123
How did you hear me say that?

11:02.291 --> 11:05.001
- I was standing way over...
- I have fantastic hearing.

11:05.169 --> 11:08.254
And a number of other
equally impressive talents.

11:14.928 --> 11:16.512
Ho-doggie!

11:18.056 --> 11:21.058
Let's go someplace quiet
so we can talk.

11:24.562 --> 11:27.146
Okay... what?
You want to talk to me?

11:27.314 --> 11:28.940
Is there a problem?

11:29.108 --> 11:31.359
Are you not attracted to me?

11:31.527 --> 11:32.694
No.

11:34.029 --> 11:36.365
I think you're hot.

11:36.533 --> 11:39.075
Baby, you have no idea.

11:45.208 --> 11:48.502
- Kiss me.
- What? Here?

11:48.670 --> 11:52.380
Don't be afraid
to explore new horizons.

11:52.548 --> 11:53.548
Oh.

12:01.473 --> 12:03.473
Can you give us
two seconds, girls?

12:03.641 --> 12:06.143
Yeah, can you give us two seconds?

12:06.310 --> 12:07.561
Sure.

12:07.729 --> 12:08.895
Whatever.

12:12.191 --> 12:13.400
Listen...

12:15.695 --> 12:17.403
you seem really nice,

12:17.571 --> 12:19.613
in a strong,

12:19.781 --> 12:21.532
scary kind of a way,

12:21.700 --> 12:23.909
but my friends
are probably waiting for me,

12:24.077 --> 12:26.912
so I'm gonna just get going.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.456
You're so nervous, Elliot.

12:29.623 --> 12:31.249
How do you know my name?

12:31.417 --> 12:32.959
I'm psychic.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.627
Plus, it's on your name tag.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.714
Duh.

12:37.882 --> 12:41.050
Now then, I just want
to talk business for a second.

12:41.218 --> 12:45.262
Oh, I'm not into that.

12:45.430 --> 12:48.098
I mean, I've never paid
for sex before.

12:48.266 --> 12:50.851
Except this one time...
there was an Internet thing.

12:51.019 --> 12:53.771
I mean, you can't help it. Every time
you sign on, it's "sex, sex, sex."

12:53.938 --> 12:56.564
I'm not a hooker, you silly boy.
I just want to ask you a question.

12:56.732 --> 12:59.984
How would you like to make
one simple decision

13:00.152 --> 13:02.528
that'll change your life forever?

13:04.198 --> 13:06.741
Okay, I'm glad Scientology
works for you, but...

13:06.909 --> 13:08.617
Just listen.

13:08.785 --> 13:11.787
What if I told you that
I have the cataclysmic power

13:11.954 --> 13:15.707
to give you anything and everything
you've always dreamed of?

13:17.126 --> 13:18.460
Who are you?

13:18.628 --> 13:21.295
Promise not to tell anyone?

13:21.463 --> 13:22.506
Okay.

13:22.673 --> 13:25.509
Cross your heart and hope to die?

13:26.928 --> 13:27.969
Yeah.

13:30.306 --> 13:32.557
I'm the devil.

13:36.269 --> 13:38.145
Okay.

13:38.313 --> 13:41.565
I think somebody's had
"tee many martoonis"!

13:41.733 --> 13:44.735
I am the devil.
Satan, Lucifer, Beelzebub.

13:44.903 --> 13:45.944
The Prince of Darkness.

13:46.111 --> 13:49.322
Well, the Princess of Darkness,
anyway.

13:49.490 --> 13:50.657
Here's my card.

13:50.825 --> 13:52.075
Oh.

13:53.577 --> 13:55.161
"The devil." Yep.

13:55.329 --> 13:57.622
That explains it.

13:57.790 --> 13:59.164
Now I believe you.

14:00.834 --> 14:02.000
Night-night.

14:06.005 --> 14:08.173
You're a very skeptical person,
you know that?

14:08.341 --> 14:09.508
How did...

14:09.676 --> 14:11.759
How did you just...
and you...

14:13.053 --> 14:16.514
Look. If you could just buy into
this "I'm the devil" thing,

14:16.682 --> 14:18.808
it'll save us both
a lot of these questions.

14:18.976 --> 14:21.185
Maybe I should call you a cab.

14:21.353 --> 14:24.688
Although it's gonna be hard to find one
that'll go to hell this time of night.

14:24.856 --> 14:27.482
Oh! What a delightfully piquant wit.

14:27.650 --> 14:30.610
I can see we're gonna
get along famously.

14:30.778 --> 14:32.612
Cheers, darling.

14:34.365 --> 14:38.033
Are you... you can't...
look at... jeez!

14:39.828 --> 14:42.997
You can't do that.
That's very dangerous!

14:43.164 --> 14:45.875
Why is this so hard
for you to believe?

14:46.042 --> 14:49.211
Do you think your mommy and daddy
just made me up so you'd be good?

14:49.379 --> 14:52.714
Okay, okay. You're the devil.
What do you want with me?

14:52.882 --> 14:56.134
I want you to be happy, Elliot.
You have such potential.

14:56.302 --> 14:58.678
All you need is a little push
in the right direction.

14:58.846 --> 15:00.179
I am happy!

15:00.347 --> 15:03.223
Oh, please!
You don't have to lie to me.

15:03.391 --> 15:06.560
I know every dark thought
in your tiny little mind.

15:06.728 --> 15:09.939
I know that every night you go home
to your horrible little apartment

15:10.107 --> 15:13.401
and you eat your little frozen dinner,
and you make your little bowl of popcorn

15:13.569 --> 15:17.404
and watch TV until you can't keep
your eyes open anymore.

15:17.572 --> 15:19.781
And then you crawl off to bed

15:19.949 --> 15:23.577
and wonder why you're alone
and nobody likes you.

15:25.246 --> 15:26.622
Not every night.

15:26.789 --> 15:28.581
And you cry.

15:32.044 --> 15:33.920
Yeah, sure.

15:35.255 --> 15:37.757
I know what's in your heart, Elliot.

15:37.925 --> 15:39.800
You could cry right now.

15:44.680 --> 15:48.767
I'm talking about reinvention,
taking control of your destiny.

15:48.935 --> 15:50.852
You want to be liked?

15:51.020 --> 15:52.604
You want to be loved?

15:52.772 --> 15:54.688
How about respected?

15:54.856 --> 15:57.232
How about feared?

16:00.278 --> 16:02.738
What exactly are we talking about?

16:02.906 --> 16:05.199
You want to see how it works, baby?

16:05.367 --> 16:06.699
Wish for something.

16:06.867 --> 16:09.285
- Like what?
- Whatever you want, it's yours.

16:09.453 --> 16:11.287
Just say the word.

16:11.455 --> 16:13.790
Okay,

16:13.958 --> 16:17.585
I wish I had a Big Mac
and a large Coke.

16:17.753 --> 16:19.711
It is done.

16:25.636 --> 16:27.303
Hi, how you doing?
What can I get you?

16:27.471 --> 16:29.305
A Big Mac and a large Coke.

16:29.473 --> 16:30.598
Fries?

16:30.766 --> 16:32.724
No.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.685
Comes to $3.47.

16:36.145 --> 16:38.647
Do you have $3.47?

16:38.815 --> 16:41.942
I left my purse in the underworld.

16:42.110 --> 16:46.487
Oh, yes!
This truly is the work of the devil!

16:46.655 --> 16:49.657
And to think that I doubted you!
I'm gonna go now.

16:49.825 --> 16:51.659
What's the problem?

16:51.827 --> 16:54.161
This doesn't prove anything!

16:54.329 --> 16:57.332
I could have done this myself.
I even had to pay for it.

16:57.499 --> 17:01.085
No such thing as a free lunch.
Didn't anyone ever tell you that?

17:01.253 --> 17:02.712
I didn't even get any fries.

17:02.879 --> 17:04.588
Oh, I don't believe this.

17:04.756 --> 17:06.674
I'm offering you
the opportunity of a lifetime

17:06.842 --> 17:09.593
and all you can do is moan
about French fries?

17:09.761 --> 17:11.803
- Good night.
- Oh, fine! Okay.

17:11.971 --> 17:15.348
I'm obviously not getting through
to you, so let's just forget it.

17:15.516 --> 17:18.268
Come on, I'll give you
a lift back to your car.

17:20.980 --> 17:22.271
That's your car?

18:03.518 --> 18:05.978
- It's him!
- It's Elliot!

18:10.525 --> 18:13.569
Elliot, right here.

18:13.737 --> 18:15.528
I love you, Elliot!

18:17.406 --> 18:18.656
Where are we?

18:18.824 --> 18:21.451
Just a little after-hours club I own.

18:21.619 --> 18:24.746
We'd better get in there.
Everyone's waiting for you.

18:24.914 --> 18:26.081
Everyone who?

18:26.248 --> 18:27.706
All your friends.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.584
How you doing, Mr. Richards?

18:30.752 --> 18:32.711
Elliot, one picture!

18:53.690 --> 18:56.526
- Hey! Hey, Elliot!
- No way! This is your club?

18:56.693 --> 18:57.693
It sure is.

18:57.861 --> 19:03.032
Wow.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.575
Yeah, baby!

19:05.743 --> 19:08.620
- Hello, Elliot.
- Hello.

19:08.788 --> 19:11.039
- Elliot, dance with me.
- No, dance with me.

19:11.207 --> 19:13.208
No, he's gonna dance with me first.

19:13.376 --> 19:16.128
Okay, girls, that's enough.
Break it up. He belongs to me.

19:16.295 --> 19:19.130
How the hell are you?
Somebody take a picture of us.

19:19.297 --> 19:21.715
- Hold it!
- Excellent.

19:21.883 --> 19:23.801
Hi, Elliot.

19:28.348 --> 19:29.932
I think she likes you, too.

19:30.100 --> 19:32.517
- Are you hungry?
- Uh-huh. Sort of.

19:32.685 --> 19:33.977
- Look.
- Wow!

19:34.145 --> 19:36.521
These look just like the cookies
my grandma used to make.

19:36.689 --> 19:38.273
- Try one.
- Okay.

19:39.775 --> 19:41.651
These are the cookies
that my grandma used to make!

19:41.819 --> 19:44.278
I aim to please, handsome.
Come on.

19:44.445 --> 19:45.779
How did you...

19:48.158 --> 19:50.659
- You liked that, didn't you?
- What, the cookie?

19:52.662 --> 19:54.496
Having all those people
excited to see you.

19:54.664 --> 19:56.664
It's nice to feel accepted, isn't it?

19:56.832 --> 19:58.791
I can give you that.

19:58.959 --> 20:01.711
I can make the whole world
love you.

20:01.879 --> 20:04.672
- Come on!
- You still don't believe me, do you?

20:04.840 --> 20:06.632
Of course not!

20:06.800 --> 20:10.343
First of all,
you look nothing like the devil.

20:10.511 --> 20:13.680
Oh, really? I suppose I could
have gone this way.

20:16.309 --> 20:19.311
But it's so trick-or-treat.

20:19.478 --> 20:21.188
It's true!

20:21.355 --> 20:23.105
You really are the devil!

20:23.273 --> 20:25.191
Oh, come on, baby.

20:25.358 --> 20:26.775
Come and sit down.

20:26.943 --> 20:30.154
I know this has all been
horribly overwhelming for you.

20:30.323 --> 20:32.908
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure, you can.

20:33.075 --> 20:34.701
You can ask me anything you'd like.

20:34.869 --> 20:36.243
As long as you don't ask me
if there's a God.

20:36.411 --> 20:40.122
I get that one all the time.
It drives me absolutely bonkers.

20:41.666 --> 20:43.584
Yes, there's a God.

20:43.752 --> 20:46.337
Really?
Well, what's He like?

20:46.504 --> 20:49.756
You'd think meeting the devil
would be interesting enough,

20:49.924 --> 20:52.383
but all they want
to know about is Him!

20:52.551 --> 20:54.385
Like He's so bloody fascinating.

20:54.553 --> 20:56.179
- So He's a man?
- Yeah.

20:56.347 --> 20:59.557
Most men think they're God.
This one just happens to be right.

20:59.725 --> 21:03.477
Now listen, darling.
I don't want to pressure you,

21:03.645 --> 21:06.521
but why don't we take
a teensy little look at the contract?

21:09.777 --> 21:14.238
What the...
it's pretty...

21:17.158 --> 21:21.578
"I, Elliot Richards,
hereafter known as 'the Damned'...

21:21.746 --> 21:24.748
- "the Damned"?
- How about "the Darned"? Better?

21:24.916 --> 21:27.333
Don't get hung up
on the language, darling.

21:27.501 --> 21:31.379
There's nothing sinister here.
It's all standard boilerplate.

21:31.546 --> 21:34.423
Paragraph one
states that "I, the devil,

21:34.591 --> 21:38.302
a nonprofit corporation with offices
in purgatory, hell, and L.A.,

21:38.470 --> 21:41.304
will give you seven wishes
to use as you see fit."

21:41.472 --> 21:44.724
Seven?
Why not eight?

21:44.892 --> 21:48.436
Why not six? I don't know.
Seven just sounds right.

21:48.604 --> 21:52.773
Paragraph two outlines the manner
in which you'll pay for the wishes.

21:52.941 --> 21:55.234
What? Are you kidding?!
I have to give you my soul?

21:55.402 --> 21:57.111
After you've had your wishes,
of course.

21:57.279 --> 21:59.780
But it's my soul!

21:59.948 --> 22:01.865
I can't give you my soul!

22:02.033 --> 22:03.617
What are you?
James Brown?

22:03.785 --> 22:06.119
What's the big deal?
Have you ever seen your soul?

22:06.287 --> 22:09.956
- Do you even know what it is?
- Of course, it's the thing that...

22:11.834 --> 22:13.626
No, that's...
it floats around...

22:13.794 --> 22:16.087
Can I tell you something?

22:16.255 --> 22:20.049
Souls are overrated.
They don't really do anything.

22:20.217 --> 22:22.343
Has yours done anything
for you so far?

22:22.511 --> 22:25.013
No, it's like your appendix.

22:25.180 --> 22:26.472
You'll never even miss it.

22:26.640 --> 22:29.934
Well, if it's so useless,
then why do you want it so much?

22:30.101 --> 22:32.311
Ooh, aren't you the clever one?

22:32.478 --> 22:36.231
Look, who's really making out
in this deal here?

22:36.399 --> 22:39.359
Seven utterly fabulous wishes

22:39.527 --> 22:41.111
for one piddling little soul?

22:41.279 --> 22:43.070
Well, I don't know.

22:44.323 --> 22:45.614
What have we here?

22:49.828 --> 22:51.996
Wait. Who is...

22:52.164 --> 22:53.539
Alison?

22:54.958 --> 22:56.374
How did you...

22:57.793 --> 23:00.211
She is so beautiful.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.673
- I've waited for you for so long.
- Who's that?

23:03.841 --> 23:05.717
- I've waited for you for so long.
- Who's she with?

23:05.885 --> 23:09.303
- I want you now, my love.
- Why are you showing me this?

23:11.222 --> 23:13.682
Oh, I love your hair like that.

23:13.850 --> 23:16.560
You must go through
conditioner like crazy.

23:18.021 --> 23:19.521
Is this real?

23:19.689 --> 23:23.316
It could be.
All you have to do is sign.

23:23.484 --> 23:25.318
And you promise I'll get her?

23:25.486 --> 23:27.570
That's really up to you.
You're the one with the wishes.

23:27.738 --> 23:32.200
But I promise I'll do
everything in my power.

23:32.368 --> 23:33.910
Sign it, Elliot.

23:43.378 --> 23:47.129
Please, Elliot. I'm waiting, Elliot.

24:12.988 --> 24:14.072
Great!

24:14.240 --> 24:17.450
Now before you start wishing,
you'll be needing this.

24:17.618 --> 24:20.412
If for any reason your wish
isn't going the way you hoped,

24:20.579 --> 24:23.581
just take out the pager, hit 666,

24:23.749 --> 24:26.208
and it'll bring you
right back to me.

24:26.376 --> 24:29.670
Why wouldn't it go the way
that I'd hoped?

24:29.838 --> 24:32.381
I was just throwing that out
as a for instance.

24:32.549 --> 24:36.009
Every wish is gonna be
100 percent fabulous.

24:36.177 --> 24:39.804
But you'll find that out
as soon as you make one.

24:39.972 --> 24:43.641
- So I should make one now?
- Well, if you don't mind.

24:43.809 --> 24:45.435
I've got places to go,

24:45.602 --> 24:49.272
people to condemn to
an eternity of fiery torment.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.898
Okay, let me think.

24:52.066 --> 24:56.570
- I... I want to be married to Alison.
- You got it.

24:56.737 --> 24:58.447
That's not all.
I want to be rich.

24:58.614 --> 25:00.198
Always a popular choice.

25:00.366 --> 25:01.575
That's not all.

25:01.742 --> 25:05.536
I want to be very rich
and very powerful.

25:05.704 --> 25:09.415
Ooh, even better.
Remember, you have to say, "I wish."

25:09.583 --> 25:11.292
Right.

25:11.460 --> 25:14.628
I wish that I were
married to Alison

25:14.796 --> 25:17.338
and that I were very, very rich
and very powerful.

25:17.506 --> 25:19.966
- How's that sound?
- Sounds good to me.

25:20.134 --> 25:21.926
Enjoy.

28:33.815 --> 28:35.274
Roberto.

30:03.733 --> 30:07.527
"I am is to visiting
in the Los Angeles

30:07.695 --> 30:10.821
for the time of vacations."

30:54.113 --> 30:56.031
"Idioto"!

35:03.513 --> 35:07.682
Alejandro?

35:07.850 --> 35:09.517
Roberto? Esteban?

36:01.650 --> 36:02.942
Mama!

36:33.264 --> 36:35.264
Seis, seis, seis!

36:43.273 --> 36:45.274
Back so soon?

36:50.571 --> 36:53.198
You turned me into a drug dealer!

36:53.366 --> 36:54.783
They almost killed me!

36:54.951 --> 36:56.660
You asked for rich and powerful.

36:56.828 --> 36:59.371
- Not like that.
- Goes with the territory, babe.

36:59.539 --> 37:02.289
"Root of all evil."
Ring any bells?

37:02.457 --> 37:05.084
But what about Alison?
What got into her?

37:05.252 --> 37:07.128
I think it was Raoul.

37:07.295 --> 37:09.296
Yeah!
That's not what I wished for.

37:09.464 --> 37:11.590
Well, hold on now, mister.

37:11.758 --> 37:13.800
You wished that
the two of you were married.

37:13.968 --> 37:16.136
You didn't say anything
about her loving you.

37:16.303 --> 37:19.139
You know, when two people
get married, I assume that...

37:19.306 --> 37:21.141
There's your mistake.

37:21.308 --> 37:24.144
- May I suggest something?
- What?

37:24.311 --> 37:26.478
The rich and powerful thing
wasn't really the way to go.

37:26.646 --> 37:29.731
Everyone wishes for that first thing
out of the gate and it never pans out.

37:29.899 --> 37:32.025
- Really?
- The fact of the matter is

37:32.193 --> 37:35.362
women aren't really attracted
to wealth and power.

37:35.530 --> 37:38.073
- They're not?
- No, of course not.

37:38.241 --> 37:40.867
They couldn't give
a fig for all that rubbish.

37:41.034 --> 37:43.995
What you need to figure out
is what she does want in a man.

37:44.163 --> 37:45.997
How do I find that out?

37:46.165 --> 37:47.582
Easy.

37:56.716 --> 37:58.800
I'm not with her!

38:02.263 --> 38:03.513
Where are we?

38:03.681 --> 38:05.890
A place you never
would have seen without my help.

38:06.057 --> 38:07.892
Welcome... Alison's bedroom.

38:09.186 --> 38:11.687
We can't be in here.
This is breaking and entering.

38:11.855 --> 38:13.689
I know.
It's fun, isn't it?

38:13.857 --> 38:16.983
I'm sure we're gonna find the answer
somewhere around here.

38:18.402 --> 38:19.904
What if Alison catches us?

38:20.071 --> 38:22.364
Don't worry.
She won't be able to see you.

38:22.532 --> 38:23.782
Besides,

38:23.950 --> 38:25.868
she's in the shower.

38:26.036 --> 38:27.036
Naked.

38:27.204 --> 38:28.204
Right behind that door.

38:28.371 --> 38:30.830
Go on, go ahead.
Take a peep.

38:30.998 --> 38:32.081
No!

38:32.249 --> 38:34.375
Oh, come on.
We both know you want to.

38:34.543 --> 38:36.961
You must think that
I'm really perverted, don't you?

38:37.129 --> 38:38.129
That's what you think.

38:38.297 --> 38:40.590
You think I'm some sad,
desperate, twisted, pathetic loser.

38:40.758 --> 38:41.758
Yes.

38:41.926 --> 38:44.134
Well, in that case,
maybe I'll just take a quick look.

38:44.302 --> 38:45.552
Focus, Elliot.

38:45.720 --> 38:48.889
Remember, we're here to find out
what kind of man she wants.

38:49.057 --> 38:50.182
How are we gonna do that?

38:50.350 --> 38:52.935
Well, she keeps a journal.

38:54.395 --> 38:55.603
And here it is!

38:55.771 --> 38:58.898
Right, I should be able to find some
information in here that's useful.

38:59.066 --> 39:00.691
Hey, that's private stuff.

39:00.859 --> 39:02.568
Is it ever!
Listen to this.

39:02.736 --> 39:05.905
"Last night was the most
incredible night of my life.

39:06.073 --> 39:09.908
I never did find out any of the guys'
names, but I brought them here

39:10.076 --> 39:12.953
and all five banged me
like a Salvation Army drum."

39:13.120 --> 39:14.120
What?

39:14.288 --> 39:15.747
- Give me that!
- Just kidding.

39:15.915 --> 39:17.123
I could have been a writer.

39:22.879 --> 39:25.714
Hey, it's okay. She could bump
into you and she wouldn't feel it.

39:27.217 --> 39:29.009
Now this is good.

39:30.262 --> 39:33.347
"I meet many
attractive men who are interested in me

39:33.514 --> 39:35.431
and, while many of them
are handsome

39:35.599 --> 39:37.433
or clever or very successful,

39:37.601 --> 39:40.395
I find myself turning away
from them

39:40.562 --> 39:44.691
and searching the horizon
for someone else.

39:44.858 --> 39:47.317
I don't know who he is
or where I'll find him.

39:47.485 --> 39:51.697
I only know
that he is a sensitive man.

39:51.864 --> 39:54.951
He's a man who's in touch
with his emotions.

39:55.119 --> 39:58.413
He's a man who's not afraid
to share his fears,

39:58.580 --> 40:01.123
his disappointments, and his tears.

40:01.291 --> 40:03.667
'Where are you,
my sensitive man?"'

40:14.512 --> 40:16.346
Did you see that?

40:16.514 --> 40:18.307
She passed right through me.

40:18.474 --> 40:20.600
We were one person
for a split second.

40:20.768 --> 40:22.477
Just like in "Ghost"!

40:22.645 --> 40:24.812
Darling, I've got an earthquake
in eight minutes.

40:24.980 --> 40:26.605
Any chance of making a wish here?

40:26.773 --> 40:28.357
Yes.

40:28.525 --> 40:32.528
I wish I were the most sensitive
man in the world.

40:32.696 --> 40:34.613
Right. Okay.

40:34.781 --> 40:35.781
Wait!

40:35.949 --> 40:39.784
I wish I were the most emotionally
sensitive man in the world.

40:39.952 --> 40:41.995
Damn, I was hoping
you wouldn't catch that.

40:42.163 --> 40:44.164
I could have had a lot of fun.

40:44.332 --> 40:45.874
And I want her to love me.

40:46.042 --> 40:47.792
Oh... you know what?

40:47.960 --> 40:50.169
I have a great feeling about this.

40:50.337 --> 40:52.338
- You do?
- Yeah, but...

40:52.505 --> 40:53.672
what do I know?

41:05.351 --> 41:07.769
- Hey.
- I'm back, my love.

41:07.936 --> 41:09.145
Where did you run off to?

41:09.313 --> 41:11.022
I went to make a garland
of beach plums

41:11.190 --> 41:14.484
to place atop your glorious head
like a crown.

41:15.860 --> 41:18.570
But then I caught sight
of that sunset and...

41:18.738 --> 41:20.238
I don't know.

41:20.406 --> 41:23.533
Something stirred inside me
and I had to stop

41:23.701 --> 41:25.327
and weep.

41:27.038 --> 41:28.537
It's beautiful.

41:28.705 --> 41:30.164
Yeah, it is.

41:33.377 --> 41:34.418
There I go again.

41:34.586 --> 41:36.837
- Tissue?
- No.

41:37.005 --> 41:40.216
I never wipe my tears away.
I'm not ashamed of them.

41:40.384 --> 41:42.050
I wear them proudly.

41:42.218 --> 41:45.762
Like small, wet, salty
badges of emotional truth.

41:45.930 --> 41:49.974
Elliot, there's something that
I think we should talk about.

41:51.435 --> 41:55.063
We've been together for, what,
about three weeks now?

41:55.231 --> 41:56.272
Three magical weeks.

41:56.440 --> 41:58.775
Three magical weeks.

41:58.943 --> 42:01.319
I don't think that I've ever met

42:01.487 --> 42:02.904
a man who's been more in touch

42:03.072 --> 42:04.948
- with his feelings.
- I love you.

42:05.116 --> 42:06.908
So very much.

42:07.075 --> 42:09.243
I love you, too.

42:13.623 --> 42:15.916
Dudley! Peter!

42:17.419 --> 42:18.961
I'm sorry, they're such little devils.

42:19.129 --> 42:21.295
Come on, you naughty boys.
See you.

42:23.924 --> 42:27.009
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

42:27.177 --> 42:29.887
Do you need comforting
on any level?

42:30.055 --> 42:31.431
No, no, I'm fine.

42:31.598 --> 42:33.432
Have I done or said anything

42:33.599 --> 42:36.101
to make you feel
less good about you?

42:36.269 --> 42:37.769
No, no, I'm fine.

42:37.937 --> 42:39.438
Would you like something to eat?

42:39.605 --> 42:41.440
I made a Salade Nicoise

42:41.607 --> 42:43.942
with dolphin-safe tuna.

42:44.110 --> 42:46.277
Oh, wow.

42:52.117 --> 42:54.243
What is it?

42:54.411 --> 42:55.828
It's that sunset again.

42:55.996 --> 42:58.580
And I worry about the dolphins.

42:58.747 --> 43:00.957
I wrote a song about them.
Would you like to hear it?

43:01.125 --> 43:02.959
Now? I...

43:12.677 --> 43:15.012
 Swimming by the sandy shore 

43:15.180 --> 43:18.265
 Dancing up among the waves 

43:18.433 --> 43:20.726
 Dolphin, dolphin, I adore 

43:20.894 --> 43:23.395
 Everything you are 

43:23.563 --> 43:26.314
 You're so much more
than a fish to me 

43:26.482 --> 43:29.358
 My playful friend
beneath the sea. 

43:32.738 --> 43:35.698
- I have to stop.
- Good. I mean, oh, why?

43:35.866 --> 43:37.407
Because I'm looking at you

43:37.575 --> 43:39.701
and I'm seeing
all the beauty of the world

43:39.869 --> 43:41.662
shining at me through your eyes.

43:41.830 --> 43:43.331
Would you mind if I sketched you?

43:43.499 --> 43:45.625
I didn't know you could draw.

43:45.792 --> 43:47.835
I'm not an artist per se.

43:48.003 --> 43:51.004
Okay, Elliot, there's something
that I think I really have to say.

43:53.466 --> 43:56.009
Elliot, that's amazing!

43:57.512 --> 43:59.346
Compared to you,
it's nothing.

43:59.514 --> 44:01.848
Compared to your smile

44:02.016 --> 44:03.349
and the blush of your cheek

44:03.517 --> 44:06.644
and the sound of your voice
as it floats on the evening breeze.

44:06.811 --> 44:09.939
Compared to you,
that sunset's just...

44:13.818 --> 44:15.693
when is that darn thing gonna set?

44:15.861 --> 44:17.695
- Maybe we should go.
- No, wait!

44:17.863 --> 44:20.156
There's so much
that I want to say to you,

44:20.324 --> 44:22.367
but I just can't find the words.

44:22.535 --> 44:24.410
I have an idea.

44:24.578 --> 44:28.330
I would like to improvise
a sonnet about your hair.

44:30.041 --> 44:33.377
How wonderful
my fair one's face...

44:38.384 --> 44:39.467
Excuse me, fellas.

44:39.635 --> 44:42.052
Might I ask you to take the horseplay

44:42.220 --> 44:43.887
down to another part of the beach?

44:44.055 --> 44:45.806
Eh... no.

44:52.188 --> 44:55.231
You know,
rather than get confrontational,

44:55.399 --> 44:57.567
why don't we all
just sit down together,

44:57.734 --> 44:59.610
have some salad
with dolphin-safe tuna

44:59.778 --> 45:02.321
and see if we can't start a dialogue.

45:04.199 --> 45:06.199
You know, I had a feeling
that you were gonna...

45:07.618 --> 45:08.827
Okay, guys.

45:08.995 --> 45:11.246
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you

45:11.414 --> 45:13.915
to respect the moment
that my woman friend

45:14.083 --> 45:16.918
and I are sharing,
because it's a special celebration

45:17.086 --> 45:18.919
of love and caring

45:19.087 --> 45:22.590
and a unique spiritual
and emotional understanding.

45:24.509 --> 45:25.801
Do you want to get a beer?

45:25.969 --> 45:27.512
Sure.

45:27.680 --> 45:30.765
Alison, excuse me, but I thought that
this was our time together.

45:30.933 --> 45:32.641
It's just a beer.
I'll be back in two seconds.

45:32.809 --> 45:34.935
Actually, my place is, like,
40 minutes from here.

45:35.103 --> 45:36.478
That's fine.
Which way's your car?

45:36.646 --> 45:38.939
- It's a van.
- Great.

45:39.107 --> 45:42.484
Alison! I respect your uniqueness
and your individuality

45:42.652 --> 45:44.320
and you're your own person.

45:44.486 --> 45:46.487
If you want to go
with our new friends here

45:46.655 --> 45:48.615
to get a drink,
I won't stand in your way.

45:48.782 --> 45:50.950
Thanks, Elliot.
I knew you'd understand.

45:51.118 --> 45:52.619
No, wait!
Don't go! Don't go!

45:52.786 --> 45:55.538
I can't handle this kind of rejection.
Why don't you want to stay?

45:55.706 --> 45:57.331
You want to know why, Elliot?

45:57.498 --> 45:59.750
Because you're just too sensitive!

45:59.917 --> 46:01.251
I'm about to go out of my mind!

46:01.419 --> 46:04.463
It's been wonderful,
and God knows I love you,

46:04.631 --> 46:06.590
but enough is enough!

46:06.758 --> 46:08.050
I just want to be with a man

46:08.217 --> 46:10.217
who'll ignore me
and take me for granted,

46:10.385 --> 46:12.094
who's only pretending
to be interested

46:12.262 --> 46:13.929
in who I am and what I think

46:14.097 --> 46:15.640
so he can get into my pants.

46:15.807 --> 46:17.516
That would be me.

46:17.684 --> 46:19.435
Oh, thank you!

46:19.603 --> 46:22.146
Let's get out of here.

46:22.314 --> 46:24.189
Alison? Wait!

46:24.357 --> 46:26.858
Alison!

46:27.026 --> 46:29.527
I'll get into your pants!

46:47.045 --> 46:50.254
Oh, Elliot, get out of there,
you silly boy.

46:50.422 --> 46:53.091
Man, you are so bad!

46:53.258 --> 46:54.384
Why, thank you.

46:54.551 --> 46:55.551
Just admit it.

46:55.719 --> 46:58.346
You're not very good at this whole
instant-travel thing, are you?

46:58.514 --> 47:01.223
I'm sorry. Now then,
what were we talking about?

47:01.391 --> 47:02.974
Oh, your next wish, wasn't it?

47:03.142 --> 47:04.851
Don't think I don't see
what you're doing.

47:05.019 --> 47:08.647
I make wishes, and you think up
ways to ruin them!

47:08.815 --> 47:10.691
I ruin them?

47:10.858 --> 47:13.026
How can you say that?

47:13.194 --> 47:16.613
I'm not perfect, you know!
Do you think I enjoy this?

47:16.781 --> 47:20.367
I'm stuck in this
horrible job for eternity,

47:20.535 --> 47:22.494
everybody hates me,
I can't sleep,

47:22.662 --> 47:24.162
and when I actually try to help someone,

47:24.330 --> 47:25.831
they turn on me like
I'm supposed to be

47:25.998 --> 47:28.249
God or something!

47:28.417 --> 47:31.585
For your information,
my life is a living hell!

47:31.753 --> 47:35.089
I work hard!
I try to look good for you!

47:35.257 --> 47:38.634
You do look good.
You look very good.

47:38.802 --> 47:41.386
I just wanted you to like me!

47:41.554 --> 47:43.179
I do like you.

47:43.347 --> 47:45.181
It's just I'm feeling
a little frustrated here.

47:45.349 --> 47:48.601
Don't give up on me, Elliot.
I'm not giving up on you.

47:48.769 --> 47:50.645
Nobody gets it totally right
right away.

47:50.813 --> 47:53.147
You're doing great. Really.

47:53.314 --> 47:56.442
- I am?
- Yeah. You are.

47:56.609 --> 47:59.111
I'm so sorry your wish
didn't work out.

48:00.822 --> 48:02.781
Friends?

48:02.949 --> 48:04.700
Sure.

48:04.868 --> 48:08.661
I'm sorry if I said anything
to upset you or make you feel bad.

48:08.829 --> 48:11.539
And I'm gonna try to be
more sensitive next time.

48:11.707 --> 48:13.458
Oh, I think you're
sensitive enough already.

48:13.625 --> 48:15.460
- You think?
- Are you kidding?

48:15.627 --> 48:16.919
You even went for me crying.

48:17.087 --> 48:19.463
Hey! Were you faking me out?
Because...

48:19.630 --> 48:21.506
I was 100% sincere.

48:21.674 --> 48:24.426
It's not easy being
the Barbra Streisand of evil, you know.

48:26.596 --> 48:28.472
What have we learned so far?

48:28.639 --> 48:30.640
Well, let's see.

48:30.807 --> 48:33.142
I'm starting to think women
really don't know what they want.

48:33.310 --> 48:34.351
Amen!

48:34.519 --> 48:37.021
They say they want sensitivity,
but you saw how fast she went

48:37.189 --> 48:39.106
for those tough dudes on the beach?

48:39.274 --> 48:40.691
Which tells you?

48:40.859 --> 48:42.485
That...

48:42.652 --> 48:45.153
well, it tells me that I want to be
really big and strong.

48:45.321 --> 48:47.864
I want to have a great body.
Tall and, like,

48:49.241 --> 48:50.492
Good. Go on.

48:50.659 --> 48:52.035
- I want to be athletic.
- Check.

48:52.203 --> 48:53.828
And I want to be rich, too.

48:53.996 --> 48:57.664
For something that I like doing
and that people really like me for.

48:57.832 --> 48:59.666
Great! This is getting
really specific.

48:59.834 --> 49:02.670
Let's see...
big, strong, rich, athletic,

49:02.838 --> 49:06.007
something you like,
lots of fans...

49:06.175 --> 49:07.759
are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

49:07.927 --> 49:09.218
Oh, I hope so.

49:09.385 --> 49:10.594
In the form of a wish?

49:10.762 --> 49:12.596
I wish I could play
professional basketball!

49:12.764 --> 49:15.892
Then I'll just say the magic words:
Dennis Rodman!

49:18.312 --> 49:20.271
- No!
- Just kidding!

49:20.439 --> 49:21.939
Michael Jordan.

49:23.191 --> 49:24.525
Yeah!

49:26.027 --> 49:29.947
Three... two... one...

49:34.536 --> 49:37.912
The fans are going nuts here
at the Forum in Los Angeles.

49:38.080 --> 49:40.373
The score, 135 to 85.

49:40.541 --> 49:42.208
Elliot Richards
has totally dominated.

49:42.376 --> 49:44.085
If you're just tuning in,
it's a shame

49:44.253 --> 49:46.295
because you've missed
one of the greatest performances

49:46.463 --> 49:47.712
in the history of sports.

49:47.880 --> 49:49.548
Absolutely, Jerry.
Absolutely.

49:49.715 --> 49:51.842
People say basketball caught fire

49:52.009 --> 49:53.927
with the ascendry
of Michael Jordan.

49:54.095 --> 49:56.972
But after what
we've seen here tonight,

49:57.139 --> 49:59.391
a lot of people are gonna be saying,
"Michael who?"

49:59.559 --> 50:01.100
Right from the get-go,

50:01.268 --> 50:03.561
the fans took a look
at Elliot Richards

50:03.728 --> 50:05.145
and a few women fainted

50:05.313 --> 50:07.273
and a few fellas,
well, I'd rather not say,

50:07.440 --> 50:09.191
but they liked what they saw.

50:09.359 --> 50:12.111
Absolutely.
He's a big fella and an imposing fella.

50:12.279 --> 50:15.446
He's enormous.
He's listed at 7'6" in the program,

50:15.614 --> 50:17.991
but I say he plays,
like you said, 11 feet tall.

50:18.158 --> 50:19.868
No, I don't think
he's that big, Jerry.

50:20.035 --> 50:22.871
No, I'm saying the game
he plays is

50:23.038 --> 50:25.415
that of some Viking giant

50:25.583 --> 50:28.792
with a basketball in one hand
and a club in the other

50:28.960 --> 50:30.961
and standing 10, 11, 12 feet tall!

50:31.129 --> 50:33.130
It's obvious that Elliot Richards

50:33.298 --> 50:35.924
will control this game
from the tip-off.

50:36.092 --> 50:37.342
Right from the get-go,

50:37.510 --> 50:40.094
Elliot is a dominating force
in tonight's game.

50:40.262 --> 50:43.806
He was "phi-slamma-jamma,"
rubbing stink all over him

50:43.974 --> 50:47.018
with rib-tickling jumps
of double-vanilla funk.

50:47.185 --> 50:50.480
Let's take a look.
Here's a pass worthy of John Elway.

50:50.648 --> 50:52.899
For the dunk!
Just a beautiful play.

50:53.066 --> 50:57.737
Here he is lining up for the 3,
and, Ricola, it's good.

50:57.905 --> 51:00.406
Here comes his patented,
over-the-shoulder,

51:00.574 --> 51:01.949
no-look three-pointer.

51:02.117 --> 51:03.743
And nothing but net.

51:06.495 --> 51:08.788
They got the rhythm tonight.

51:08.956 --> 51:11.499
They're in the zone.

51:11.667 --> 51:13.585
Here he is soaring through the air

51:13.753 --> 51:16.296
like a man on a flying trapezius.

51:16.464 --> 51:19.882
Bam! That's what I'm talking about!

51:20.050 --> 51:22.301
Destroying the backboard
and the glass!

51:22.469 --> 51:24.887
- This kid's an animal.
- Let's take another look.

51:25.055 --> 51:26.055
And boom!

51:26.222 --> 51:28.849
Humpty-hump, dump-dump!

51:29.017 --> 51:32.644
I love this game, folks.
I sure enough do!

51:32.811 --> 51:35.605
Elliot Richards spitting
glass at your ass!

51:35.773 --> 51:38.775
Bob is courtside with
Elliot Richards now. Bob?

51:38.943 --> 51:40.401
Thank you, Jerry and Dan.

51:40.569 --> 51:42.736
Elliot, you must be one
very proud young man this evening.

51:42.904 --> 51:45.906
Simply put, that was a staggeringly
dramatic display of athletic ability.

51:46.074 --> 51:48.617
Well, you know,
you go out there

51:48.785 --> 51:51.244
and you give 110%
and you want to play good.

51:51.412 --> 51:54.831
You hope you play good.
I think we played pretty good tonight.

51:54.999 --> 51:58.960
In sports terminology... and I
don't mean to sound contrary here...

51:59.127 --> 52:02.546
the word "good" falls short
of encompassing the sheer virtuosity

52:02.714 --> 52:05.007
of your performance this evening.

52:05.175 --> 52:08.718
Um, well, you know,
there's no "I" in the word "team"

52:08.886 --> 52:12.222
and this is a team effort,
and I want to say I'm proud

52:12.390 --> 52:15.684
to be associated with
these fine individuals

52:15.851 --> 52:18.144
that I have had
the pleasure of working with.

52:18.312 --> 52:21.855
I would never want to dis your
teammates, but you realize that

52:22.023 --> 52:25.818
you smashed Wilt Chamberlain's
record of 100 points in a game

52:25.986 --> 52:28.362
set in Hershey, Pennsylvania,
all those years ago?

52:28.530 --> 52:32.157
Oh, man, you just gotta play one game
at a time and give 110%.

52:32.325 --> 52:35.828
You gotta show you want it more
than they do when the chips fall.

52:35.996 --> 52:38.706
Thank you very much.
Back to you, Jerry and Dan.

52:38.873 --> 52:41.625
All right!
Diablos!

52:41.793 --> 52:43.919
Number one, yeah!

52:48.173 --> 52:50.508
Elliot.
Hi.

52:50.676 --> 52:52.510
Alison Gardner.

52:52.678 --> 52:54.053
"The Sporting News."

52:56.056 --> 52:57.640
It's nice to meet you, ma'am.

52:57.808 --> 53:00.559
God, I can't tell you how
thrilled I am to meet you.

53:00.727 --> 53:03.186
I was wondering if there
was a possibility

53:03.354 --> 53:05.772
if you might consider doing
something exclusive with me

53:05.940 --> 53:07.441
for the magazine.

53:07.608 --> 53:10.402
You know, maybe more intimate,
one-on-one.

53:10.570 --> 53:12.319
Just the two of us.

53:12.487 --> 53:16.574
Yeah, right, I'd kill you one-on-one!

53:16.742 --> 53:19.160
Shoot!

53:19.327 --> 53:23.539
God, it's so exciting to be here.
I mean...

53:23.707 --> 53:26.291
you must have an enormously huge

53:26.459 --> 53:28.752
talent to do what you do.

53:28.919 --> 53:30.587
Well, you know,

53:30.755 --> 53:32.672
you go out there
and you just give 110%.

53:32.840 --> 53:34.674
And...

53:34.842 --> 53:37.469
you hope you play good.
And you want to play good.

53:37.636 --> 53:39.720
I think we played pretty good.

53:39.888 --> 53:41.805
God, you were incredible tonight.

53:41.973 --> 53:45.809
Watching you... I just kept thinking
how unbelievably big

53:45.977 --> 53:49.104
your ego must be
after a game like that.

53:49.272 --> 53:51.397
Well, not that big, really.

53:51.565 --> 53:52.940
I bet it's pretty big.

53:53.108 --> 53:55.193
Well, it gets a little bit bigger.

53:56.612 --> 53:59.156
It depends on how happy I am!

54:05.120 --> 54:08.748
Want to go back to my place?
I'll show you my bottle cap collection.

54:08.916 --> 54:12.418
Oh, God, that would...
that would be tremendous.

54:12.586 --> 54:14.087
All right! Well...

54:14.254 --> 54:16.963
I should...
I should get dressed.

54:17.131 --> 54:18.715
I can't wait.

54:26.475 --> 54:28.142
Oh, my God!

54:30.311 --> 54:34.106
Hey! What the hell?

54:34.273 --> 54:36.817
- God, there's this...
- Hey!

54:36.984 --> 54:38.652
Damn!

54:38.820 --> 54:40.278
Oh, heck!

54:40.446 --> 54:43.280
Oh, God,
I remembered there's

54:43.448 --> 54:45.366
this teeny, tiny thing to do.

54:45.534 --> 54:47.409
- What's teeny?
- No, no.

54:47.577 --> 54:49.829
- Just something I have to write.
- About me?

54:49.996 --> 54:52.498
Yeah, just a little, short,
itty-bitty blurb

54:52.666 --> 54:54.208
about tonight's game.

54:54.376 --> 54:56.501
Well, can I see you
after the road trip?

54:56.669 --> 54:59.337
I would love to,
but I'm working on

54:59.505 --> 55:02.507
a really big, huge,
enormous story on the NFL,

55:02.675 --> 55:05.510
so I probably won't have time.

55:05.678 --> 55:07.386
Shoot, I understand.

55:07.554 --> 55:10.514
- You gotta give 110%.
- Right.

55:10.682 --> 55:12.558
- Stay within yourself.
- Hey, go, yeah.

55:12.725 --> 55:16.854
Hey, um... thanks for your time.

55:17.021 --> 55:19.189
So long.

55:19.357 --> 55:21.357
Oh!

55:21.525 --> 55:23.025
What the hell?!

55:23.193 --> 55:25.069
Oh, damn the devil!

55:25.237 --> 55:28.573
Damn the devil to hell!

55:28.740 --> 55:30.366
Shoot! Darn it!

55:30.534 --> 55:33.118
Where the heck did I put that?

55:39.750 --> 55:41.793
5-5-5.

55:43.796 --> 55:45.297
7-7-7.

55:57.475 --> 55:59.184
Now what are you doing?

55:59.351 --> 56:00.894
You seem so upset, Elliot.

56:01.061 --> 56:03.104
Do you want me to give you
something to help you relax?

56:03.272 --> 56:04.397
You bet I'm upset.

56:04.565 --> 56:06.900
You gave me this little,
teeny-weeny winkie.

56:07.067 --> 56:09.153
Well, that's easily fixed, you know.

56:09.321 --> 56:10.696
Now then, let's see.

56:10.864 --> 56:13.823
There's some M&M's for room 320.

56:13.991 --> 56:15.742
Red Hots for 316.

56:15.910 --> 56:17.660
You're giving them candy?

56:17.828 --> 56:20.371
Placebos.
They work as well as the real thing.

56:20.539 --> 56:21.873
It's a scientific fact.

56:22.041 --> 56:24.374
You can't give sick people Tic Tacs.

56:24.542 --> 56:26.335
Sick people have
notoriously bad breath.

56:26.502 --> 56:28.962
I'm performing
a public service here.

56:29.130 --> 56:30.923
Now then, about your next wish.

56:32.800 --> 56:34.885
All right, okay.

56:35.053 --> 56:36.928
Well...

56:37.095 --> 56:38.763
I want to be smart.

56:38.931 --> 56:40.723
No, I want to be really smart.

56:40.891 --> 56:43.768
I want to be able to talk good.
"Well."

56:43.936 --> 56:45.311
What's the word?

56:45.479 --> 56:46.604
Articulate?

56:46.772 --> 56:49.148
Articulate!
Yeah, I want to be articulate.

56:49.316 --> 56:52.275
And I want to be witty
and sophisticated.

56:52.443 --> 56:55.487
Charming. I want to know
everything about everything

56:55.655 --> 56:57.447
and I want to be popular.

56:57.615 --> 56:59.157
I want to be good-looking.

56:59.325 --> 57:00.533
No, no, make that great-looking!

57:00.701 --> 57:04.328
And I want Alison to fall
head over heels in love with me.

57:04.496 --> 57:05.746
Anything else?

57:05.914 --> 57:07.706
Like what?

57:07.874 --> 57:09.708
Like winkiewise?

57:09.876 --> 57:12.378
Oh, right.

57:12.545 --> 57:15.838
Yeah, well,

57:16.006 --> 57:18.967
I want to be big.

57:19.134 --> 57:21.177
Not like practical-joke big,

57:21.345 --> 57:23.763
but, you know, sort of...

57:26.141 --> 57:27.809
yeah, like that.
Is that clear?

57:27.976 --> 57:30.602
Crystal. You just say "I wish"
and I'll fill in the rest.

57:32.397 --> 57:35.399
I wish that
I was witty and articulate...

57:35.566 --> 57:36.566
Blah, blah, blah.

57:36.734 --> 57:38.777
You got it, smarty-pants.

57:38.945 --> 57:42.154
Take two of these
and call me in the morning.

57:59.172 --> 58:01.424
Oh! Elliot!

58:01.591 --> 58:04.510
Oh, it is so wonderful
to see you, darling!

58:07.680 --> 58:10.682
New York has been
so deadly dull without you.

58:10.850 --> 58:11.891
Where have you been?

58:12.059 --> 58:14.644
Out in the Hamptons, of course.
Up to my ears in my new book.

58:14.812 --> 58:16.104
What, another one?

58:16.272 --> 58:18.857
You've written four books
in three years.

58:19.025 --> 58:21.650
- What's this one about?
- Oh, same old, same old.

58:21.818 --> 58:24.570
A deconstruction of the neoromantic
period in art and literature

58:24.738 --> 58:26.196
from the political
and economic perspective

58:26.364 --> 58:28.532
of the Industrial Revolution
in France, England, and Germany.

58:28.700 --> 58:30.659
I can't imagine who reads this stuff!

58:32.119 --> 58:34.662
Well, Elliot,
the critics, apparently.

58:34.830 --> 58:36.789
It's already won the Pulitzer Prize

58:36.957 --> 58:38.709
and it hasn't
even been published yet.

58:38.877 --> 58:41.295
Like they say,
Dr. Ngegitigegitibaba,

58:41.463 --> 58:45.298
a Pulitzer Prize
and $3.50 will get you a caffe latte.

58:45.466 --> 58:47.050
So modest.

58:47.217 --> 58:49.052
Darling,
you really should get around.

58:49.219 --> 58:51.721
Everyone's dying to see you.
Mingle.

58:58.061 --> 59:00.103
Darling, you look fabulous.
Vassily Mishka?

59:00.271 --> 59:02.898
What a charming man.
Who is that?

59:03.066 --> 59:04.232
Oh, that's Elliot Richards.

59:04.400 --> 59:06.568
He's a very successful writer.

59:06.736 --> 59:10.404
He's a very successful everything,
as a matter of fact.

59:10.572 --> 59:12.490
That's Elliot Richards?

59:12.657 --> 59:15.284
Oh, I've read all his books.
He's brilliant.

59:15.452 --> 59:17.244
I had no idea he was so handsome.

59:17.412 --> 59:19.413
Why don't you go and talk to him?

59:19.581 --> 59:23.291
- I couldn't. What would I say?
- Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

59:23.459 --> 59:26.544
Just let him do all the talking.

59:26.712 --> 59:28.588
It's a common misapprehension

59:28.756 --> 59:30.673
that the word "gin"
comes from the city Geneva.

59:30.841 --> 59:34.844
But the word "geneva," small "g,"
is a corruption of genievre,

59:35.012 --> 59:36.929
which is French for "juniper,"

59:37.097 --> 59:40.224
the wonderful berry that flavors
this miraculous libation.

59:42.268 --> 59:44.938
Speaking of miraculous.

59:45.106 --> 59:47.357
I'm Elliot Richards.
How do you do?

59:47.525 --> 59:49.108
I know who you are.

59:49.275 --> 59:51.693
I'm Alison Gardner.

59:51.861 --> 59:54.822
I just had to tell you
how much I loved your novel

59:54.989 --> 59:56.281
"Always Toujours."

59:56.449 --> 59:59.535
Well, I was just trying
to make a simple point, really.

59:59.702 --> 01:00:02.620
Every time I've reread
Camus and Sartre,

01:00:02.788 --> 01:00:04.038
I kept thinking to myself,

01:00:04.206 --> 01:00:06.624
"Why does the existential dilemma

01:00:06.792 --> 01:00:09.794
- have to be so damned bleak?"
- Yes.

01:00:09.962 --> 01:00:11.838
Yes, we're alone in the universe.

01:00:12.005 --> 01:00:14.464
Yes, life is meaningless,
death is inevitable.

01:00:14.632 --> 01:00:16.633
But is that necessarily
so depressing?

01:00:16.801 --> 01:00:19.803
I couldn't agree more.

01:00:19.971 --> 01:00:22.556
Don't you think
secular humanism is yummy?

01:00:22.723 --> 01:00:24.307
Oh, delish.

01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.316
My, my.

01:00:34.484 --> 01:00:36.986
They say alcohol is a disinhibitor,

01:00:37.154 --> 01:00:38.821
and it's working very well on me.

01:00:38.989 --> 01:00:40.530
Me, too.

01:00:42.992 --> 01:00:45.535
What an exquisite feeling.

01:00:45.703 --> 01:00:48.121
Every cell in my body just...

01:00:48.289 --> 01:00:50.790
wants to reach out
and touch someone.

01:00:50.958 --> 01:00:54.126
Yes, it's incredible, isn't it?

01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:59.256
The physiology of touch.

01:00:59.424 --> 01:01:01.300
Just below your epidermis,

01:01:01.468 --> 01:01:05.053
concentrated in your fingertips,

01:01:05.221 --> 01:01:08.347
palms of your hands,

01:01:08.515 --> 01:01:11.142
soles of your feet,

01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:13.186
clitoris,

01:01:13.353 --> 01:01:15.855
nipples, penis,

01:01:16.023 --> 01:01:17.064
lips,

01:01:17.232 --> 01:01:19.357
tongue.

01:01:19.525 --> 01:01:22.736
Thousands of tiny little
Meissner's corpuscles

01:01:22.904 --> 01:01:26.448
all deliciously sensitive
to even the slightest caress,

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:29.743
sending all those tiny little
endorphin-producing

01:01:29.911 --> 01:01:33.997
pleasure messages
to the hypothalamus...

01:01:35.416 --> 01:01:37.042
the primitive brain.

01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:40.545
I'm tingling all over.

01:01:40.713 --> 01:01:43.881
Do you know the largest organ
in the human body?

01:01:45.717 --> 01:01:50.095
- I can guess.
- You'd be wrong.

01:01:50.263 --> 01:01:52.973
It's your integumentary system.

01:01:53.141 --> 01:01:57.352
Your creamy,

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.896
soft,

01:02:00.064 --> 01:02:04.526
and completely desirable skin.

01:02:04.693 --> 01:02:08.154
- Can we go to your place?
- For something more?

01:02:13.743 --> 01:02:17.412
Oh, this is so perfect!

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:20.374
Everything here
absolutely screams

01:02:20.542 --> 01:02:23.251
Elliot Richards.

01:02:23.418 --> 01:02:26.045
Actually, most of the screaming

01:02:26.213 --> 01:02:28.256
takes place...

01:02:30.175 --> 01:02:31.592
in the bedroom.

01:02:44.063 --> 01:02:47.065
What the hell is going on, Mary?

01:02:47.233 --> 01:02:49.191
- Who are you?
- Don't play games with me,

01:02:49.359 --> 01:02:51.110
Mr. Richards.
I'm in no mood.

01:02:51.278 --> 01:02:54.780
I've been out of my mind all night.

01:02:54.948 --> 01:02:57.866
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

01:02:58.034 --> 01:02:59.785
Who's your little friend?

01:02:59.953 --> 01:03:02.203
Maybe I should be running along.

01:03:02.371 --> 01:03:04.622
Wait. This is a mistake.
I'm not gay.

01:03:04.790 --> 01:03:08.585
Oh, really?
And I'm Tony Danza.

01:03:08.752 --> 01:03:10.378
Honestly, I swear it. I'm not.

01:03:10.546 --> 01:03:11.796
Well, then tell me,

01:03:11.964 --> 01:03:14.798
who was in the Broadway cast
of "The Pajama Game"?

01:03:14.966 --> 01:03:17.760
Janis Paige, John Raitt,
Eddie Foy, Jr...

01:03:17.928 --> 01:03:19.304
I assume
you mean the original cast

01:03:19.471 --> 01:03:22.224
because there was a revival
in 1973 with Hal Linden...

01:03:22.392 --> 01:03:24.310
I am gay!

01:03:24.477 --> 01:03:25.769
I rest my case.

01:03:25.937 --> 01:03:28.605
Wait. I can prove to you
that I am not gay.

01:03:28.772 --> 01:03:29.772
Kiss me.

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.984
Oh! This is just sad.

01:03:33.152 --> 01:03:34.986
Will you shut up, bitch?

01:03:35.154 --> 01:03:37.822
Please, Alison,
let me kiss you.

01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:40.824
Remember the champagne,
the corpuscles?

01:03:40.992 --> 01:03:43.744
All right, Elliot, kiss me.

01:03:54.588 --> 01:03:55.838
I'm gay.

01:03:56.006 --> 01:03:59.175
- Well, thanks for dropping by.
- Good night.

01:03:59.343 --> 01:04:01.010
Buh-bye.

01:04:02.387 --> 01:04:04.554
You've been drinking again,
haven't you?

01:04:04.722 --> 01:04:06.348
This is just like the night

01:04:06.515 --> 01:04:09.017
you had all those
Brandy Alexanders

01:04:09.185 --> 01:04:10.852
and ran up and down Fire Island

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:13.980
with your cute little Speedos,
singing "Evergreen" at the top...

01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:19.151
And so the cow
was returned to its rightful owner.

01:04:19.319 --> 01:04:20.778
Okay, boys,

01:04:20.945 --> 01:04:23.197
tonight's homework.
Algebra.

01:04:23.365 --> 01:04:26.158
Xn + Yn = Zn.

01:04:26.326 --> 01:04:29.620
Well, you're never
gonna use that, are you?

01:04:31.038 --> 01:04:34.207
Imperialism and the First World War.

01:04:34.375 --> 01:04:38.461
What was done is done.
No point thinking about it now.

01:04:38.629 --> 01:04:40.505
German, French, Spanish.

01:04:40.673 --> 01:04:44.091
Ja, ja, oui, oui, sí, sí.
It's nonsense.

01:04:44.258 --> 01:04:45.634
Everyone speaks English anyway.

01:04:45.802 --> 01:04:48.428
And if they don't,
they ought to.

01:04:48.596 --> 01:04:50.722
So, no homework tonight.

01:04:52.850 --> 01:04:54.726
But I want you to watch
a lot of television,

01:04:54.894 --> 01:04:56.644
don't neglect your video games,

01:04:56.812 --> 01:04:57.895
and I'll see you in the morning.

01:04:58.063 --> 01:05:01.524
Shall we say 10:00, 10:30?

01:05:01.692 --> 01:05:03.359
No point in getting up
too early, is there?

01:05:10.242 --> 01:05:12.076
Elliot, darling.

01:05:12.244 --> 01:05:15.246
What a lovely surprise!

01:05:15.414 --> 01:05:17.081
I hope you had a pleasant evening.

01:05:17.249 --> 01:05:19.083
As if you didn't know.

01:05:19.251 --> 01:05:20.584
I'm sorry, darling.

01:05:20.752 --> 01:05:22.752
I know it must be
really frustrating for you.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.921
Maybe I can make it up
to you somehow.

01:05:25.089 --> 01:05:28.550
Yeah, you've been
a really big help so far.

01:05:28.718 --> 01:05:31.761
I know. I've been really
naughty, haven't I?

01:05:31.929 --> 01:05:34.430
Maybe a good spanking's in order.

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:37.599
Is that all you think about?
Do you think everything is about sex?

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.518
No, of course not.

01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:43.605
I mean, there's greed, gluttony,
sloth, anger, vanity, envy.

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:46.650
No, there's also honesty
and hard work

01:05:46.818 --> 01:05:49.986
and caring about people
and doing good for somebody else.

01:05:50.154 --> 01:05:53.614
Oh, you're just a big Boy Scout,
aren't you?

01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:56.784
I find that incredibly appealing.

01:05:56.952 --> 01:05:59.537
No. All I've been doing
is thinking about myself.

01:05:59.704 --> 01:06:01.830
I could be doing all these
really important things

01:06:01.998 --> 01:06:03.123
to help other people.

01:06:03.291 --> 01:06:04.791
What about Alison?

01:06:04.959 --> 01:06:08.211
Oh, I don't know anymore.
You mess it up anyway.

01:06:08.379 --> 01:06:10.756
I know that Alison's
not really like that.

01:06:10.923 --> 01:06:13.257
What exactly do you have in mind?

01:06:13.425 --> 01:06:16.844
I want to do something great
for mankind.

01:06:17.012 --> 01:06:18.804
I want to create a better world.

01:06:18.972 --> 01:06:22.475
I want to go down in history
for doing something really important

01:06:22.642 --> 01:06:24.894
and I want Alison
to take me really seriously

01:06:25.061 --> 01:06:26.269
and to treat me with respect.

01:06:26.437 --> 01:06:28.897
I sense a wish coming on.

01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:32.650
Yes!

01:06:34.528 --> 01:06:35.904
I wish

01:06:36.071 --> 01:06:38.822
that I was the President
of the United States.

01:06:40.116 --> 01:06:41.784
That is the noblest,

01:06:41.951 --> 01:06:44.369
most unselfish thing
I've ever heard.

01:06:44.537 --> 01:06:46.330
And it's a great way to meet girls.

01:06:46.498 --> 01:06:49.124
Bless you, Elliot Richards,

01:06:49.292 --> 01:06:52.252
and Godspeed.

01:06:56.299 --> 01:06:58.467
Mr. President!

01:06:58.635 --> 01:07:00.177
Alison Gardner.

01:07:00.345 --> 01:07:02.846
We're so honored
to have you here, sir.

01:07:07.351 --> 01:07:11.521
No, no, no.

01:07:11.688 --> 01:07:15.983
The actors are beside themselves
with excitement.

01:07:16.151 --> 01:07:17.526
We're going to a play?

01:07:17.693 --> 01:07:19.277
I think you'll find it quite amusing.

01:07:19.445 --> 01:07:22.155
It's called "Our American Cousin."

01:07:22.323 --> 01:07:24.866
You know, I think I've seen it.
As a matter of fact, I'm sure I have.

01:07:25.034 --> 01:07:27.035
I don't think you've seen it, sir.

01:07:27.203 --> 01:07:30.621
- It's an entirely new play.
- Really? I think I know how it ends.

01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:33.249
- Say, can we just go to a movie?
- A what?

01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:35.209
The president.

01:07:43.008 --> 01:07:46.261
You seem tense tonight,
Mr. President.

01:07:46.428 --> 01:07:49.264
Oh, well, you know,
I've had a lot on my mind,

01:07:49.431 --> 01:07:53.184
what with preserving the Union
and my wife going crazy and all.

01:07:58.356 --> 01:08:00.399
Can I help you find something,
Mr. President?

01:08:00.567 --> 01:08:02.944
Yeah, I'm looking for my pager.

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:05.154
- Your what, sir?
- My pager.

01:08:05.322 --> 01:08:08.407
It's this little red plastic thingy.

01:08:08.575 --> 01:08:12.411
It looks kind of like a cell phone,
only smaller.

01:08:12.579 --> 01:08:14.121
I'm sorry! Sorry!

01:08:19.042 --> 01:08:20.335
All right, no problem.

01:08:20.502 --> 01:08:23.754
No problem! No problem!
No problem.

01:08:25.424 --> 01:08:27.884
- Sic semper tyrannis.
- Wait!

01:08:30.429 --> 01:08:31.511
Okay.

01:08:47.944 --> 01:08:49.529
You're late, Richards.

01:08:49.697 --> 01:08:52.616
Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.
It won't happen again.

01:08:52.783 --> 01:08:54.492
See that it doesn't.

01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:56.703
I don't think a person
with your extremely limited

01:08:56.871 --> 01:08:59.496
personal-professional skills
can afford to push the envelope.

01:08:59.663 --> 01:09:01.999
Yes, sir.

01:09:04.627 --> 01:09:06.127
Thank you, sir.

01:09:14.428 --> 01:09:15.720
Creep.

01:09:17.848 --> 01:09:20.433
So tell me, how was it?
I'm dying to know.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.310
What are you doing here?

01:09:22.478 --> 01:09:24.435
Just think of me
as a computer virus.

01:09:24.604 --> 01:09:26.979
I think of you as a plague.

01:09:27.148 --> 01:09:30.692
Now will you get off my screen?
I have work to do.

01:09:30.859 --> 01:09:34.154
Whoa, what's this whole
"get thee behind me" thing?

01:09:34.322 --> 01:09:36.448
We still have business here,
Mr. Richards.

01:09:36.616 --> 01:09:39.742
No, not now.
I told you, I've got work to do.

01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:41.577
And besides,
I've only got two wishes left

01:09:41.745 --> 01:09:43.662
- and I don't want to screw them up.
- Correction.

01:09:43.830 --> 01:09:45.038
You have one wish left.

01:09:45.207 --> 01:09:48.376
Nice try.

01:09:48.542 --> 01:09:52.252
- I've got two more coming.
- No. Count them, baby.

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:56.007
- You were President of the US.
- Yeah, okay, one.

01:09:56.175 --> 01:09:58.218
You were a charming,
handsome, articulate,

01:09:58.386 --> 01:10:00.011
celebrated author and raconteur.

01:10:00.179 --> 01:10:03.180
Yeah, and you turned me
into a flaming homosexual.

01:10:03.348 --> 01:10:05.391
- Professional basketball player.
- Three.

01:10:05.558 --> 01:10:07.559
The sensitive, caring,
artistic guy was four.

01:10:07.727 --> 01:10:09.269
And the Colombian drug lord was five.

01:10:09.437 --> 01:10:12.356
- That means I have two more coming.
- You forgot the Big Mac and Coke.

01:10:12.524 --> 01:10:15.858
- What? That wasn't a wish.
- What do you call it?

01:10:16.026 --> 01:10:19.070
You said, "I wish," and I got it
for you. Sounds like a wish to me.

01:10:19.238 --> 01:10:21.531
No! No, no, no, no.
That's not fair.

01:10:21.699 --> 01:10:24.200
Fair? Who do you think
you're talking to?

01:10:24.368 --> 01:10:27.371
I don't recall anybody
ever accusing me of being fair before.

01:10:27.539 --> 01:10:29.664
- I think I'm insulted.
- What? You can't...

01:10:29.832 --> 01:10:31.666
no, this isn't right!
You can't do this!

01:10:31.834 --> 01:10:33.668
What are you gonna do?
Sue me?

01:10:33.836 --> 01:10:35.336
No! That's it!

01:10:35.504 --> 01:10:37.547
I've had it with you!

01:10:37.715 --> 01:10:38.881
The whole deal is off.

01:10:39.049 --> 01:10:40.717
Off!

01:10:42.051 --> 01:10:43.885
Shut up!

01:10:59.234 --> 01:11:00.401
Are you all right?

01:11:02.738 --> 01:11:03.904
Not really.

01:11:06.824 --> 01:11:08.450
I need to talk to God.

01:11:08.617 --> 01:11:10.493
Well, that's the power of prayer.

01:11:10.661 --> 01:11:13.079
Just say what's in your heart
and He hears.

01:11:13.247 --> 01:11:14.581
No, you don't understand.

01:11:14.749 --> 01:11:17.333
I really need to talk to Him.

01:11:17.501 --> 01:11:19.626
Now. It's urgent.

01:11:19.794 --> 01:11:22.337
Is it something you can tell me?

01:11:22.505 --> 01:11:25.924
No, it's personal.

01:11:26.092 --> 01:11:28.802
There's nothing you could say
that I wouldn't understand.

01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:31.096
Um...

01:11:31.264 --> 01:11:33.389
Why don't you just try me?

01:11:33.557 --> 01:11:35.266
Okay, a few days ago,

01:11:35.434 --> 01:11:37.435
I sold my soul to the devil
for seven wishes.

01:11:37.603 --> 01:11:39.979
I've already had five of them,
but the devil says I've had six.

01:11:40.147 --> 01:11:41.898
But I'm not counting
the Big Mac and the Coke,

01:11:42.066 --> 01:11:44.859
and she is and I don't think
that's fair, do you?

01:11:48.654 --> 01:11:50.280
This is so unnecessary.

01:11:50.448 --> 01:11:53.325
- You're coming downtown.
- The devil gypped me for a burger!

01:11:53.493 --> 01:11:55.368
Tell your story to the sergeant.

01:11:55.536 --> 01:11:57.912
So do you have a copy
of this contract?

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.414
No, I told you, she keeps it
in her office.

01:12:00.582 --> 01:12:03.918
- At this nightclub in Oakland.
- Yes, at a nightclub

01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:05.461
and, no, I can't tell you where it is.

01:12:05.629 --> 01:12:07.588
Because you promised
the devil you wouldn't?

01:12:07.756 --> 01:12:09.632
No, because she drove.
That's why.

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.927
Right.
In a Lamborghini Diablo.

01:12:13.095 --> 01:12:15.805
- Look, Officer.
- Sergeant.

01:12:15.972 --> 01:12:18.182
Sergeant, I know my rights.

01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:20.142
I don't have to talk to you
without a lawyer.

01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:22.228
So you either book me
or you let me go.

01:12:22.395 --> 01:12:24.145
Oh, gee, are those my choices?

01:12:24.313 --> 01:12:26.523
Oh, what do I do, what do I do?

01:12:26.690 --> 01:12:29.609
I choose "book you."
Throw him in the lockup.

01:12:29.777 --> 01:12:30.819
Arraignment in the morning.

01:12:30.986 --> 01:12:32.862
- Drunk and disorderly.
- What?! Hey!

01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:36.157
- Recommending psychiatric evaluation.
- It's her! It's her, she's the devil!

01:12:36.324 --> 01:12:39.785
One more word out of you and
I'll pop you one, you whacko bastard.

01:12:39.953 --> 01:12:41.829
Now move it.

01:12:48.754 --> 01:12:50.003
Spread them.

01:12:51.548 --> 01:12:53.799
There's no point fighting about this.

01:12:53.967 --> 01:12:57.845
You have to learn to accept
the inevitable.

01:12:58.012 --> 01:12:59.847
We're all doomed anyway,

01:13:00.014 --> 01:13:02.473
so you might as well
just get with the program,

01:13:02.641 --> 01:13:05.893
wish your way out of here,
and move on.

01:13:08.355 --> 01:13:11.315
I wasn't kidding
when I said I liked you.

01:13:11.483 --> 01:13:12.859
I do, Elliot.

01:13:13.026 --> 01:13:16.194
I think you have
massive potential.

01:13:16.362 --> 01:13:18.864
If you're looking
at an eternity in hell,

01:13:19.031 --> 01:13:21.116
let me tell you,

01:13:21.284 --> 01:13:24.578
it wouldn't hurt
to have a friend like me.

01:13:32.043 --> 01:13:35.671
So you just think about that.
Give me a call when you're ready.

01:13:44.513 --> 01:13:46.014
She's a devil, that one.

01:13:46.182 --> 01:13:47.724
What?

01:13:54.564 --> 01:13:56.565
I said, she's a devil,
that lady cop.

01:14:00.321 --> 01:14:02.614
Yeah, I guess.

01:14:02.781 --> 01:14:04.616
What you in for, brother?

01:14:05.867 --> 01:14:06.909
Eternity.

01:14:07.076 --> 01:14:09.620
Oh, that's a long time.

01:14:09.787 --> 01:14:12.956
You must have did
some really bad shit.

01:14:13.124 --> 01:14:14.750
Yeah.

01:14:16.628 --> 01:14:18.212
I sold my soul.

01:14:18.379 --> 01:14:20.421
Hope you got something good for it.

01:14:20.589 --> 01:14:22.882
As a matter of fact,
I got nothing for it.

01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:25.635
Well, that's a really bad deal,
if you ask me.

01:14:25.802 --> 01:14:29.722
Well, I'm not asking you.

01:14:35.102 --> 01:14:37.354
Doesn't really matter, though.

01:14:37.521 --> 01:14:40.482
- You can't sell your soul anyway.
- Oh, really?

01:14:40.650 --> 01:14:42.817
Why do you say that?

01:14:42.985 --> 01:14:45.402
It doesn't really belong to you
in the first place.

01:14:45.570 --> 01:14:47.279
No way, nohow.

01:14:47.447 --> 01:14:50.908
So who does it belong to?

01:14:54.913 --> 01:14:57.288
It belongs to God.

01:14:57.456 --> 01:14:59.165
That universal spirit that animates

01:14:59.333 --> 01:15:02.210
and binds all things in existence.

01:15:04.296 --> 01:15:07.924
The devil gonna try to confuse you.
But that's her gig.

01:15:08.092 --> 01:15:11.301
But in the end, you'll see clear
to who and what you are

01:15:11.469 --> 01:15:13.303
and what you're here to do.

01:15:13.471 --> 01:15:15.931
Now, you're gonna make
some mistakes along the way,

01:15:16.099 --> 01:15:17.307
everybody does,

01:15:17.475 --> 01:15:20.852
but if you just open up your heart
and open up your mind,

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:23.980
you'll get it.

01:15:26.191 --> 01:15:27.483
Who are you?

01:15:30.362 --> 01:15:32.822
Just a friend, brother.

01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:34.657
Just a really good friend.

01:16:40.802 --> 01:16:42.636
Hey, baby!

01:16:52.563 --> 01:16:53.938
We love you, Elliot!

01:16:54.106 --> 01:16:56.274
Elliot, darling.

01:16:56.442 --> 01:16:58.610
So nice of you to drop by.

01:16:58.778 --> 01:17:01.154
Come into my office.

01:17:01.322 --> 01:17:05.532
Oh, don't worry about them.
They're having a fabulous time.

01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:07.368
Pathetic, aren't they?

01:17:07.535 --> 01:17:09.578
Everybody wants to go
to the party,

01:17:09.746 --> 01:17:12.998
but nobody wants
to pay the piper.

01:17:13.166 --> 01:17:14.958
- Are you...?
- Don't get too excited.

01:17:15.126 --> 01:17:17.960
It's just a Halloween costume.

01:17:18.128 --> 01:17:20.963
Anyway, Elliot, my darling,
have you thought of your last wish?

01:17:21.131 --> 01:17:22.840
No.

01:17:23.008 --> 01:17:25.427
Well, I hate to put a big rush on this,
but there is a time limit.

01:17:25.595 --> 01:17:26.762
Read your contract.

01:17:36.981 --> 01:17:38.649
I really don't want another wish.

01:17:38.817 --> 01:17:40.776
That's funny.

01:17:40.944 --> 01:17:42.319
Do you think
this halo's too much?

01:17:42.487 --> 01:17:46.155
No. I really don't want it.

01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:50.660
What do you mean,
you don't want it?

01:17:50.828 --> 01:17:52.495
You get seven wishes.

01:17:52.663 --> 01:17:54.705
There's nothing I want.

01:17:55.958 --> 01:17:59.918
Well, there are things that I want,
but nothing that you can give me.

01:18:00.086 --> 01:18:03.130
What is that supposed to mean?

01:18:03.297 --> 01:18:05.549
Well...

01:18:05.716 --> 01:18:07.926
last night,
when I was lying in jail,

01:18:08.094 --> 01:18:09.135
I was talking to this guy

01:18:09.302 --> 01:18:12.096
and I realized that wishing
just doesn't work.

01:18:12.264 --> 01:18:14.306
All my life I wished
to be better-looking,

01:18:14.474 --> 01:18:17.351
richer, successful, talented, whatever.

01:18:17.519 --> 01:18:19.562
I always thought it'd be great
if someone could just wave

01:18:19.729 --> 01:18:21.813
a magic wand
and make that happen.

01:18:21.981 --> 01:18:24.941
Well, I realized that
it just doesn't work by magic.

01:18:25.109 --> 01:18:27.777
I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:18:27.945 --> 01:18:31.656
And I've been
starting to think that

01:18:31.824 --> 01:18:35.159
it really isn't that important
how far we go in life anyway.

01:18:35.326 --> 01:18:37.369
It's how we get there
that really matters.

01:18:37.537 --> 01:18:39.079
Oh.

01:18:39.247 --> 01:18:42.833
You know,
that is so inspiring.

01:18:44.377 --> 01:18:45.836
So it's okay?

01:18:46.004 --> 01:18:49.172
Well, no, Elliot.
I'm afraid it's not okay.

01:18:49.339 --> 01:18:50.590
A deal's a deal.

01:18:50.757 --> 01:18:53.134
You get one more wish,
and I get your soul.

01:18:53.302 --> 01:18:55.136
So let's just get on with it,
shall we?

01:18:55.304 --> 01:18:58.973
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Oh, really?

01:18:59.141 --> 01:19:01.683
Before you get all hinky,
I should warn you.

01:19:01.851 --> 01:19:04.019
I'm not all peaches and cream,
you know.

01:19:04.187 --> 01:19:07.898
I do have a darker side
and, believe me, it's not pretty.

01:19:08.065 --> 01:19:10.817
Now you can go easy,
or you can go hard,

01:19:10.985 --> 01:19:13.986
but one way or another,
I will get your soul.

01:19:14.154 --> 01:19:15.821
I'm not gonna do it.

01:19:15.989 --> 01:19:19.200
There's nothing that you can say
or do that will make me.

01:19:19.367 --> 01:19:21.119
Oh, I think you'll change your mind.

01:19:21.287 --> 01:19:23.788
I'm just gonna slip into
something a little more terrifying.

01:19:23.956 --> 01:19:25.207
See you in hell!

01:19:34.382 --> 01:19:36.550
Wait, wait, wait!
Just wait a minute!

01:19:38.802 --> 01:19:40.136
Wait!

01:19:41.847 --> 01:19:45.058
Now listen to me,
you disgusting little maggot!

01:19:45.226 --> 01:19:46.935
This is your last chance

01:19:47.102 --> 01:19:49.437
before the big weenie roast!

01:19:49.605 --> 01:19:52.731
Make a wish or forever burn in hell!

01:19:52.899 --> 01:19:55.776
Okay! Okay!

01:19:55.944 --> 01:19:57.903
I wish...

01:19:58.071 --> 01:20:00.405
I wish that Alison has a happy life.

01:20:00.573 --> 01:20:02.741
Oh, God.

01:20:28.099 --> 01:20:30.140
Is this heaven?

01:20:30.308 --> 01:20:32.601
Heaven?
God, no, it's the courthouse.

01:20:32.769 --> 01:20:34.770
I'm just meeting
a couple of lawyers for lunch.

01:20:34.938 --> 01:20:36.814
Clients of mine.
Come on.

01:20:38.358 --> 01:20:41.610
Wait, what happened
to the whole,

01:20:41.778 --> 01:20:43.861
you know, fire

01:20:44.029 --> 01:20:48.157
- and the big, horny guy with...
- Oh, just a few special effects.

01:20:48.325 --> 01:20:50.785
Sort of the Universal Studios
tour of evil.

01:20:50.953 --> 01:20:54.664
It normally works pretty well,
but evidently you weren't going for it.

01:20:54.832 --> 01:20:56.665
Your last wish
was a deal-breaker.

01:20:56.833 --> 01:20:59.835
- What?
- Nobody ever reads the contract.

01:21:00.003 --> 01:21:02.963
Article 147, paragraph 9, section 3:

01:21:03.131 --> 01:21:04.756
Selfless acts of redemption.

01:21:04.924 --> 01:21:06.133
Huh?

01:21:06.301 --> 01:21:09.177
Basically, it says,
"If you commit one truly benevolent act,

01:21:09.345 --> 01:21:10.637
it voids the contract."

01:21:10.805 --> 01:21:12.598
So I get to keep my soul?

01:21:12.765 --> 01:21:15.225
Yes, you get to keep your soul.

01:21:17.103 --> 01:21:18.395
Yes!

01:21:20.607 --> 01:21:24.358
Yes! I get to keep my soul!

01:21:30.115 --> 01:21:33.284
On November 16th, I'll have been
doing this for 6,000 years

01:21:33.452 --> 01:21:36.119
and you're the first person
to give away one of their wishes.

01:21:36.287 --> 01:21:37.829
I hope it's not
the beginning of a trend.

01:21:37.997 --> 01:21:40.498
- You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?
- No, no, I promise.

01:21:40.666 --> 01:21:42.751
Nope.

01:21:42.918 --> 01:21:47.504
I don't get it, though.
I mean, why are you being nice?

01:21:47.672 --> 01:21:50.966
Look, Elliot.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

01:21:51.134 --> 01:21:52.926
The whole "good and evil" thing...

01:21:53.094 --> 01:21:54.970
you know, Him and me.

01:21:55.138 --> 01:21:57.306
It really comes down to you.

01:21:57.474 --> 01:21:59.515
You don't have to look hard
for heaven and hell.

01:21:59.683 --> 01:22:02.352
They're right here on Earth.

01:22:02.519 --> 01:22:04.771
You make the choice.

01:22:04.938 --> 01:22:06.482
And I guess you just made yours.

01:22:06.650 --> 01:22:08.525
So I can go now?

01:22:08.693 --> 01:22:10.944
Unless you want another
seven wishes.

01:22:12.363 --> 01:22:14.822
- No, thanks.
- Didn't think so.

01:22:16.533 --> 01:22:18.242
I really liked you, you know.

01:22:20.204 --> 01:22:23.247
Well, to tell you the truth,

01:22:23.415 --> 01:22:25.248
you've been the best friend
I've ever had.

01:22:25.416 --> 01:22:27.709
Oh, dear.
Don't go gushy on me now.

01:22:27.877 --> 01:22:29.544
Okay.

01:22:29.712 --> 01:22:33.548
Go on. Go.
You'll scare the fish away.

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:54.860
Alison?

01:22:55.028 --> 01:22:57.405
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:22:57.572 --> 01:22:58.614
Oh, uh...

01:22:58.782 --> 01:23:01.242
Elliot Richards.
We've met a couple times.

01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:04.786
Yeah, I remember.
Hi, how are you?

01:23:04.954 --> 01:23:06.162
I'm great.

01:23:06.330 --> 01:23:08.415
I'm exaggerating.
I'm good.

01:23:11.585 --> 01:23:15.255
We've been working together here
for the last four years

01:23:15.423 --> 01:23:17.756
and I've always noticed you

01:23:17.924 --> 01:23:21.927
and thought that you looked
like a very interesting person.

01:23:22.095 --> 01:23:24.722
I don't know how interesting I am.

01:23:24.889 --> 01:23:28.641
Well, the truth is I don't know you
and you don't know me,

01:23:28.809 --> 01:23:31.602
and if we were
to get to know each other

01:23:31.770 --> 01:23:33.896
that there's a chance
that we just might hit it off.

01:23:34.064 --> 01:23:38.025
So I was wondering if you wanted
to go get a cup of coffee or...

01:23:38.193 --> 01:23:41.528
That's really so nice of you.

01:23:41.696 --> 01:23:43.321
I'm seeing someone.

01:23:46.284 --> 01:23:48.618
Well, of course you are.

01:23:48.786 --> 01:23:52.122
He's sure one lucky guy.

01:23:53.624 --> 01:23:56.459
Listen, if it ever doesn't
work out with him, then...

01:23:59.296 --> 01:24:00.546
- That's so nice of you.
- Really?

01:24:00.714 --> 01:24:02.590
- Yeah. Okay.
- Thanks a lot.

01:24:02.758 --> 01:24:05.634
- I'll see you around.
- Okay, take care. Bye.

01:24:08.679 --> 01:24:10.972
- Go. It's a joke.
- It's only 10 bucks.

01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:14.142
- What's he gonna do?
- Right.

01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:16.478
Hey, Elliot, fo-felliot, so-smelliot.

01:24:16.645 --> 01:24:18.813
What's up, dudester?
Yeah.

01:24:18.981 --> 01:24:20.647
What do you say we go down
to the club tonight

01:24:20.815 --> 01:24:23.859
and pick up some chickette?

01:24:26.613 --> 01:24:27.821
Nice talking to you, Bob.

01:25:02.522 --> 01:25:03.897
- Hey.
- New neighbors?

01:25:04.065 --> 01:25:05.357
Guess so.

01:25:08.528 --> 01:25:11.028
Hi. Oh.

01:25:11.196 --> 01:25:13.739
Hi. You must be the boy next door.

01:25:13.907 --> 01:25:15.699
Do you want to give me a hand?

01:25:17.118 --> 01:25:19.870
Habla English?
Spracht English?

01:25:20.038 --> 01:25:22.498
Parlez-vous "Americiano"?

01:25:25.042 --> 01:25:28.711
- Hi, I'm Elliot Richards.
- Hey. Nicole Delarusso.

01:25:28.879 --> 01:25:31.714
Don't call me Nicky, though.
Everyone always calls me Nicky.

01:25:31.882 --> 01:25:34.384
It starts as Nicole,
then becomes Nicky, then Nick,

01:25:34.552 --> 01:25:37.553
then Ni, then just "Nn."
People just call me "Nn."

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:39.096
I'm cracking myself up here.

01:25:39.264 --> 01:25:41.390
- You want to give me a hand?
- Yes, I do.

01:25:41.558 --> 01:25:44.017
- Okay.
- Oh, wow.

01:25:44.185 --> 01:25:45.561
You got the new Ingebritzens!

01:25:45.728 --> 01:25:48.105
- Yeah, they're the best!
- They're the best!

01:25:51.692 --> 01:25:54.026
I'd be happy to hook
these up for you

01:25:54.194 --> 01:25:57.572
so you could have some music,
if you wanted, while you're unpacking.

01:25:57.739 --> 01:26:00.616
I could make us dinner...
that way you won't have to cook.

01:26:00.784 --> 01:26:02.701
Yeah, right.
Me, cook?

01:26:02.869 --> 01:26:04.244
Thank you.

01:26:04.412 --> 01:26:07.789
Say, Nicole, you wouldn't happen
to have a sister, would you?

01:26:07.957 --> 01:26:10.709
No sisters,
but I've got a lot of brothers, though.

01:26:10.877 --> 01:26:12.878
 Hey, hey 

01:26:13.045 --> 01:26:16.171
 Did you ever think
that there might be another way? 

01:26:16.339 --> 01:26:20.426
 Just feel better,
just feel better about today 

01:26:20.594 --> 01:26:23.178
 Oh, no 

01:26:23.346 --> 01:26:26.932
 If you never wanna
have to turn and go away 

01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:31.353
 You might feel better,
might feel better if you stay 

01:26:33.273 --> 01:26:35.149
 Yeah, yeah 

01:26:35.317 --> 01:26:38.277
 I bet you haven't heard
a word I've said 

01:26:38.445 --> 01:26:40.446
 Yeah, yeah 

01:26:40.613 --> 01:26:43.323
 I've had enough of all your trying 

01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:47.286
 Just give up
the state of mind you're in 

01:26:47.454 --> 01:26:52.041
 If you wanna be somebody else 

01:26:52.208 --> 01:26:58.338
 If you're tired of fighting battles
with yourself 

01:26:58.505 --> 01:27:02.634
 If you wanna be somebody else 

01:27:02.801 --> 01:27:12.976
 Change your life 

01:27:15.396 --> 01:27:17.564
 Hey, hey 

01:27:17.732 --> 01:27:20.858
 Have you ever danced in the rain
or thanked the sun 

01:27:21.026 --> 01:27:23.486
 Just for shining,
just for shining 

01:27:23.654 --> 01:27:25.321
 Or the sea 

01:27:25.489 --> 01:27:27.949
 Oh, no 

01:27:28.116 --> 01:27:31.243
 Take it all in,
the world's a show, and, yeah 

01:27:31.411 --> 01:27:35.538
 You look much better,
look much better when you glow 

01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:39.334
 Yeah, yeah 

01:27:39.502 --> 01:27:42.629
 I hope you've heard
every word I've said 

01:27:42.797 --> 01:27:44.755
 Yeah, yeah 

01:27:44.923 --> 01:27:47.883
 If you've had enough
of all your trying 

01:27:48.051 --> 01:27:52.221
 Just give up the state of mind
you're in 

01:27:52.389 --> 01:27:56.684
 If you wanna be somebody else 

01:27:56.851 --> 01:28:02.939
 If you're tired of fighting battles
with yourself 

01:28:03.107 --> 01:28:07.151
 If you wanna be somebody else 

01:28:07.319 --> 01:28:17.704
 Change your mind 

01:28:19.206 --> 01:28:29.214
 Ooh, yeah 

01:28:36.138 --> 01:28:37.471
 Hey, hey 

01:28:37.639 --> 01:28:41.058
 What ya say we both go
and seize the day 

01:28:41.226 --> 01:28:45.354
 'Cause what's your hurry,
what's your hurry, anyway? 

01:28:47.232 --> 01:28:49.399
 Yeah, yeah 

01:28:49.567 --> 01:28:52.277
 I hope you've heard
every word I've said 

01:28:52.445 --> 01:28:54.529
 Yeah, yeah 

01:28:54.697 --> 01:28:57.574
 If you've had enough
of all your trying 

01:28:57.742 --> 01:29:01.785
 Just give up the state of mind
you're in 

01:29:04.497 --> 01:29:09.084
 If you wanna be somebody else 

01:29:09.252 --> 01:29:15.214
 If you're tired of losing battles
with yourself 

01:29:15.382 --> 01:29:19.469
 If you wanna be somebody else 

01:29:19.636 --> 01:29:40.654
 Change your mind 

01:29:42.157 --> 01:29:56.211
 Ooh, yeah 

01:29:56.378 --> 01:30:02.468
 Ooh, yeah.
