00:04.921 --> 00:06.923
[choral music playing over headphones]

00:17.600 --> 00:19.769
[inaudible dialogue]

00:19.853 --> 00:20.895
Lieutenant.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.398
Take a breath and start over.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.316
You need to see this, captain.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.360
One of our radar satellites picked it up.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.070
It's a ship, a large one.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.739
Over 1000 feet.

00:30.822 --> 00:33.324
-Is it transmitting?
-Negative.

00:33.408 --> 00:36.661
Its transponder seems to be off.
It won't respond to our requests.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.998
-Could be a Kuznetsov.
-That close to shore undetected?

00:40.749 --> 00:43.126
Aircraft carriers don't just appear
out of nowhere.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.169
[monitor beeps]

00:44.252 --> 00:45.086
Whoa.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.297
And they sure as hell don't disappear
into thin air.

00:47.380 --> 00:50.633
I've got another one,
same size, bearing 183 degrees,

00:50.717 --> 00:54.971
traveling 22 knots, no active transponder,
26 miles east of the last one.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.058
-Has to be a technical issue, right?
-We're not taking any chances.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.935
Scramble a Hornet.
I want a pilot to tell me what he sees.

01:01.019 --> 01:04.481
Captain, radar satellites are picking up
an incoming projectile mid-flight.

01:04.564 --> 01:06.316
Looks like a cruise missile inbound.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.610
Our warning satellites didn't
pick up the launch.

01:08.693 --> 01:10.737
We can try to confirm
with ground-based radar.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.030
How fast is it traveling?

01:12.906 --> 01:15.492
Bearing 179 degrees at Mach 5.5.

01:15.575 --> 01:18.536
Get StratCom on the line.
Call Space Command, see what they know.

01:18.620 --> 01:21.706
Calculating. At that distance,
we have 52 seconds to impact.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.166
StratCom on line 5, captain.

01:23.875 --> 01:24.876
This is Captain Ridge.

01:24.959 --> 01:27.754
We got warning of a missile
but no indication of launch.

01:27.837 --> 01:31.049
-You guys seeing anything?
-[man 1] <i>That's a negative, sir.</i>

01:31.132 --> 01:32.133
Stand by.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.052
Nineteen seconds to impact.

01:34.135 --> 01:36.513
[man 2] Space Command reports
all systems nominal, sir.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.181
No solar flares or weather events.

01:38.264 --> 01:42.227
Close the blast doors.
Everybody take cover, blast positions!

01:43.645 --> 01:44.646
[man 3] Ten seconds.

01:44.729 --> 01:48.733
Nine, eight, seven, six,

01:49.234 --> 01:50.568
five, four,

01:51.361 --> 01:54.239
three, two, one.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.208
[suspenseful music playing]

02:16.427 --> 02:19.639
Ladies and gentlemen,
this concludes our demonstration.

02:20.140 --> 02:24.978
The bidding will be open
for 36 hours beginning now.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.285
[Cooper] I was surprised by your call.

02:40.368 --> 02:41.744
I've never met Governor Nance.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.913
I didn't realize
he knew anything about me.

02:43.997 --> 02:47.000
A handful of people know
what I'm about to tell you,

02:47.083 --> 02:49.627
so whatever happens here,
we're assuming your discretion.

02:51.629 --> 02:55.425
After 41 years of service,
Senator Warwick has decided to retire.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.094
Sorry to hear that,
but I'm not sure how that connects

02:58.177 --> 03:01.598
to the governor's legislative director
asking me to breakfast.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.600
Once Senator Warwick steps down,

03:03.683 --> 03:06.561
the governor will have the authority
to appoint his replacement.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.438
-Your name came up.
-Me?

03:08.521 --> 03:10.440
You've had
a distinguished military career,

03:10.523 --> 03:14.611
followed by a long and, from what I hear,
exemplary run at the bureau.

03:15.236 --> 03:18.156
You're serious?
The governor is considering this?

03:18.239 --> 03:21.659
He's a good man, Harold.
He's looking for the right person.

03:22.577 --> 03:23.870
Whatever good you're doing,

03:23.953 --> 03:26.456
think about how much
you could accomplish in the Senate.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.666
Real change on a national level.

03:29.542 --> 03:33.421
You earned this opportunity.
The people of Virginia need you.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.924
-What do you need?
-Permission.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.967
To consider you for the position.

03:38.760 --> 03:42.263
I need to know you'll say yes
if we go in your direction.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.058
[cell phone ringing]

03:49.312 --> 03:50.438
[Raymond] <i>Senator?</i>

03:50.521 --> 03:53.441
I wasn't aware
you had political ambitions.

03:53.524 --> 03:56.778
I don't. But, apparently,
the governor thinks I should.

03:56.861 --> 03:58.821
What does Charlene think?

03:58.905 --> 04:00.365
I haven't told her yet.

04:00.990 --> 04:03.993
You're telling me
before telling your wife?

04:04.077 --> 04:07.664
Harold, please tell me
there's no trouble in paradise.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.874
No. I value your opinion.

04:10.458 --> 04:14.587
I already know what she thinks.
The governor's got an ulterior motive.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.839
I've always said you married up.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.593
So he's interested in me
for more than my undeniable charm.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.720
I'm Black. I'm law enforcement.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.889
I check some boxes. Is that so bad?

04:24.973 --> 04:26.349
Not those boxes, no.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.726
But I'm in one of your boxes, Harold.

04:28.810 --> 04:33.189
And if the governor knows that,
he may be under the false impression

04:33.273 --> 04:36.442
that you are prone to moral ambiguity.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.903
-Because I work with you.
-Mmm.

04:38.987 --> 04:42.073
Because you put up with me,
who I am, what I do.

04:42.156 --> 04:43.741
Because at times...

04:44.534 --> 04:46.160
you look the other way.

04:47.620 --> 04:51.082
-I choose the greater good.
-Which I see as admirable

04:51.165 --> 04:54.377
and the governor may see as situational.

04:55.378 --> 04:58.381
Clamayto, Clamato, tornado, typhoon.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.675
Let's talk about why I called.

05:01.175 --> 05:05.555
What do you know about
the National Reconnaissance Office?

05:05.638 --> 05:09.559
I know it took over 30 years
for the government to admit it exists.

05:09.642 --> 05:13.938
Mr. Ogden Greeley works with them
as a defense contractor. Or he did.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.898
Five days ago, he went missing.

05:15.982 --> 05:19.068
Greeley has SAP-level clearance.

05:19.152 --> 05:23.531
Everything there is to know about
this country's satellite technology,

05:23.614 --> 05:24.615
he knows it.

05:24.699 --> 05:27.285
The CIA assumed he was abducted,

05:27.368 --> 05:30.496
possibly by the Iranians or the Russians.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.458
-That would be an act of war.
-If it had happened.

05:33.541 --> 05:36.294
The truth, I'm afraid,
is even more disturbing.

05:36.377 --> 05:40.298
Associates of mine in the Middle East
forwarded me a communiquÃ©,

05:40.381 --> 05:43.718
one that I'm sure
your intelligence community

05:43.801 --> 05:47.472
will hear about in short order
if they haven't already.

05:49.223 --> 05:50.725
[Greeley] <i>I am a patriot.</i>

05:51.225 --> 05:53.186
<i>I've tried and failed to convince</i>

05:53.269 --> 05:56.939
<i>those charged with keeping America safe</i>
<i>to act responsibly.</i>

05:57.023 --> 05:59.317
<i>As a result, I have come to believe</i>

05:59.400 --> 06:02.278
<i>that the only way</i>
<i>to address our security issues</i>

06:02.361 --> 06:04.030
<i>is to exploit them.</i>

06:04.113 --> 06:07.116
<i>To show the bureaucrats,</i>
<i>through military defeat,</i>

06:07.200 --> 06:09.952
<i>the flaws they are too blind</i>
<i>to see on paper.</i>

06:10.036 --> 06:13.414
<i>I have decided to sell</i>
<i>my knowledge of the vulnerabilities</i>

06:13.498 --> 06:16.918
<i>present in our satellite systems</i>
<i>to the highest bidder.</i>

06:17.001 --> 06:20.296
Greeley said he's taking bids. Who from?

06:21.005 --> 06:22.381
Well, there's the rub.

06:23.257 --> 06:24.967
North Korea, Russia and Iran?

06:25.051 --> 06:26.886
[Cooper] Those are the countries
Reddington knows about.

06:26.969 --> 06:30.807
We have to assume there are others,
as well as a number of individual actors.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.559
The National Reconnaissance Office?
Never heard of them.

06:33.643 --> 06:34.477
[Cooper] For good reason.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.814
They design, build, launch, and maintain
all of America's spy satellites.

06:37.897 --> 06:40.233
They're the backbone
of U.S. national security.

06:40.316 --> 06:43.111
Radar, radio, military cell transmissions,

06:43.194 --> 06:46.614
the intel every Pentagon general
and soldier depends on

06:46.697 --> 06:47.740
to defend this country.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.368
[Ressler] Greeley's former NSA,
got a wife and kids in Bethesda.

06:50.451 --> 06:54.664
Lifers like him don't just wake up
and decide to betray their country.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.749
[Cooper] Find the wife,
see what she knows.

06:56.833 --> 07:00.294
Agent Mojtabai and I will reach out
to the NRO and CIA. Warn them.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.004
How much time do we have?

07:02.088 --> 07:04.715
Reddington says bidding ends in 13 hours.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.763
Sorry, it's a bit of a war zone
in here today.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.724
No problem, Mrs. Greeley.
We're sorry to take more of your time.

07:13.808 --> 07:16.978
Agents from the bureau were here
and some other people from the NRO.

07:17.061 --> 07:19.897
We know.
We're with a specialized task force.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.357
Look, I want to help.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.860
But Ogden didn't talk about his work.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.070
<i>Whoever has him, the Russians or--</i>

07:26.154 --> 07:29.490
<i>If he tells them what they want,</i>
<i>there's no reason to hurt him, right?</i>

07:29.574 --> 07:32.452
-They'll let him go?
-We believe he wasn't taken,

07:32.535 --> 07:35.705
that he chose to disappear
and he's selling classified intelligence.

07:35.788 --> 07:36.706
[Alice] Ogden?

07:36.789 --> 07:39.625
That's not possible.
Why do you believe that?

07:39.709 --> 07:42.795
Did you see or hear anything
that might help us?

07:42.879 --> 07:44.297
Anywhere he might be hiding?

07:44.380 --> 07:45.506
[Alice] <i>He's not hiding.</i>

07:45.590 --> 07:48.384
<i>If he's not here,</i>
<i>it's because he can't be.</i>

07:48.468 --> 07:50.011
Ogden is a good man.

07:50.094 --> 07:52.847
I know it's hard to imagine
he would betray his country--

07:52.930 --> 07:55.141
Not just his country, his family.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.186
No. Ogden loves us.

07:58.936 --> 08:00.062
I know my husband.

08:00.688 --> 08:01.647
<i>He's a good man.</i>

08:04.442 --> 08:05.318
Is it done?

08:06.444 --> 08:07.278
Mm-hm.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.542
[playful music playing]

08:21.626 --> 08:22.710
[Anne] You're back.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.590
Oh. [chuckles] The Cape May warbler.

08:28.925 --> 08:29.926
Anna, right?

08:30.426 --> 08:31.302
Anne.

08:31.385 --> 08:32.470
Anne.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.598
Meeting your friends again?

08:35.681 --> 08:37.433
[Raymond] Escaping friends, actually.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.811
And work. Escaping it all for today.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.523
You picked the right place for that.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.817
You're an artist.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.361
Heavens, no.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.822
I'm not fast enough to finish most.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.951
Sometimes I just draw the nests.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.870
I like their nests.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.915
Funny how they go through all that work,

09:00.998 --> 09:04.252
building a home, raising a brood,
and then leave it.

09:06.587 --> 09:07.964
It's kind of sad.

09:08.756 --> 09:10.424
But they're fun to sketch.

09:10.508 --> 09:11.342
May I?

09:21.310 --> 09:22.979
Oh, I like these an awful lot.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.189
What is your name again?

09:25.856 --> 09:26.816
Raymond.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.820
Who's this little fella?

09:31.862 --> 09:32.905
Fox sparrow.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.867
Becoming quite rare
in this part of the country.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.287
Lives just up the way here.

09:40.079 --> 09:40.913
Where?

09:42.039 --> 09:43.124
I could show you.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.046
How long were the two of you married?

09:49.714 --> 09:51.549
Almost 25 years.

09:53.467 --> 09:56.929
Cal died of lung cancer
a month before our anniversary.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.139
Big smoker.

09:59.682 --> 10:02.101
Some people like to live dangerously.

10:02.184 --> 10:04.061
Yes. Some do.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.065
What do you do?

10:09.317 --> 10:10.860
I'm a fugitive.

10:11.527 --> 10:14.697
Number one on the FBI's Most Wanted List.

10:15.239 --> 10:17.325
[chuckles] One, huh?

10:18.159 --> 10:21.454
-I would've gone with fourth.
-[chuckles]

10:21.537 --> 10:22.788
You're not just a stranger,

10:22.872 --> 10:25.041
you're a stranger
with delusions of grandeur.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.587
[Raymond] Do you live near the park?

10:30.129 --> 10:31.380
I live in Kansas.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.549
Little town north of Wichita.

10:34.175 --> 10:37.428
-Wichita? Famous for their linemen.
-Mmm.

10:38.012 --> 10:40.056
What brings you to New York City?

10:40.139 --> 10:42.266
Surely, not just the birds.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.393
Show-tune trip.

10:46.854 --> 10:49.607
Cal and I were real big theater folks.

10:51.108 --> 10:53.527
Anyway, after he passed,

10:53.611 --> 10:58.449
I promised myself I'd go see
some real theater on Broadway.

10:58.532 --> 11:01.035
So I clip my coupons.

11:01.118 --> 11:02.453
Save up all year.

11:02.953 --> 11:05.039
Get myself a place at the Sheraton

11:05.122 --> 11:07.667
and see as many shows as I can in a week.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.670
What a delightful idea.

11:11.295 --> 11:14.924
Seeing <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i> tonight.
Last show of the trip.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.468
Is this it?

11:18.344 --> 11:21.597
The residence of our fox sparrow?

11:22.181 --> 11:24.183
It's where he was last time.

11:29.688 --> 11:32.274
I wonder what it is about bird-watching.

11:34.610 --> 11:36.028
I find it so...

11:36.946 --> 11:37.988
calming.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.911
An escape
from all the rest of it, I suppose.

11:45.246 --> 11:49.417
I imagine a man with your profession
must be quite good at escaping.

11:50.459 --> 11:53.796
Raymond, may I ask you
a personal question?

11:53.879 --> 11:54.880
Anything.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.092
Would you...

11:59.301 --> 12:03.180
be interested in half
a chicken salad sandwich?

12:06.183 --> 12:07.435
I think I would.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.228
[both chuckle]

12:09.854 --> 12:10.855
[cell phone chimes]

12:13.107 --> 12:15.693
-Oh. That's my Uber.
-Oh.

12:17.361 --> 12:18.195
Ah...

12:18.863 --> 12:21.282
It was so nice to see you again, Anne.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.869
I hope you enjoy the show tonight.

12:24.952 --> 12:26.328
Oh, I will.

12:27.329 --> 12:29.748
Sorry we couldn't find that fox sparrow.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.501
Well, I'll be back in a month.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.628
Maybe I can find him then.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.589
Wait, you don't live here?

12:36.672 --> 12:40.259
Sometimes. Seems like
I'm always on the move.

12:40.342 --> 12:41.760
Well, aren't I the heel?

12:42.761 --> 12:46.724
I realize I know nothing about you.
I've been doing all the talking.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.477
I think it's been just divine.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.188
-[cell phone ringing]
-Oh.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.942
Ah. I have to take this.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.153
I'm sorry.

13:00.571 --> 13:01.405
[mouths] Bye.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.911
Did you speak with Marvin?

13:06.994 --> 13:09.413
Yes. We can cover the retainer.

13:09.497 --> 13:10.498
<i>Talk to Zurich.</i>

13:10.581 --> 13:14.835
I want to fund the balance
without compromising any liquidity.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.963
You said you needed one hour.
It's been three.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.089
Has it?

13:19.715 --> 13:20.925
Oh, my goodness.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.636
I feel like a different person.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.262
You're unguarded, Raymond.

13:25.763 --> 13:26.931
It's not safe.

13:27.556 --> 13:30.100
A moment's peace
and an afternoon of freedom

13:30.184 --> 13:33.062
are rewards that far outweigh the risk.

13:33.145 --> 13:36.106
<i>Just call Zurich.</i>
<i>Don't worry about me, I'm fine.</i>

13:38.692 --> 13:39.818
[Anne] I canceled it.

13:40.861 --> 13:44.323
Curtain time isn't till 8,
and I can get a cab anytime.

13:44.823 --> 13:47.660
-What do you have in mind?
-You helping me

13:47.743 --> 13:49.954
finding a souvenir for my sister.

13:50.037 --> 13:53.791
I know an extraordinary, tiny, tiny,

13:53.874 --> 13:58.963
barely-enough-room-for-the-both-
of-us chocolate shop about...

13:59.797 --> 14:02.716
-seven or eight blocks from here.
-Ooh.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.764
[man] Agents Park and Ressler, come in.

14:08.847 --> 14:10.849
Jim Halloran, director of the NRO.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.602
-Paul Thorn, DNI's Office.
-Thanks for agreeing to meet.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.896
We've seen the recording Cooper sent.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.774
You believe Greeley has the intel
he's trying to sell?

14:18.857 --> 14:19.775
[Halloran] No question.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.820
He didn't just work on our satellites,
he designed the software.

14:22.903 --> 14:25.698
-Wrote the code himself.
-[Thorn] Our national defense

14:25.781 --> 14:27.950
is dependent on satellite technology.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.411
You realize what kind of threat
we're dealing with?

14:30.494 --> 14:32.413
We fire a missile,
it's guided by satellites.

14:32.496 --> 14:34.707
Someone fires at us,
we detect it the same way.

14:34.790 --> 14:37.751
We use them to track every jet, ship,
Humvee, and soldier we have.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.838
-Greeley can shut them down?
-[Halloran] It's worse than that.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.340
<i>He knows enough to damage</i>
<i>the satellites irreparably.</i>

14:43.424 --> 14:45.759
[Thorn] <i>Greeley's code is on dozens</i>
<i>of our critical systems.</i>

14:45.843 --> 14:47.261
<i>What if he designed a backdoor?</i>

14:47.344 --> 14:49.221
<i>Every asset he touched</i>
<i>could be infiltrated.</i>

14:49.305 --> 14:51.307
[Halloran] <i>He could be handing</i>
<i>our enemies control.</i>

14:51.390 --> 14:52.933
<i>All our data would be sent to them,</i>

14:53.017 --> 14:55.561
<i>our drones could be landed</i>
<i>at their airfields.</i>

14:55.644 --> 14:58.397
They'll make us think
we have accurate intel when we don't.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.733
[Ressler] Drones and aircraft
can't be effective

15:00.816 --> 15:02.735
if they're seeing targets
that don't exist.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.612
Or not seeing targets that do.

15:04.695 --> 15:08.240
If an enemy of the United States buys
that intel and uses it,

15:08.324 --> 15:10.492
we're looking at a war we can't win.

15:15.456 --> 15:16.790
[dramatic music playing]

15:16.874 --> 15:20.836
I found him. We asked allied agencies
for intel on Greeley.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.046
They sent us this.

15:22.713 --> 15:25.716
-[Park] Five months ago in a Berlin hotel.
-What was he doing there?

15:25.799 --> 15:29.261
Uh, whatever it was, it, um...
wasn't with his wife.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.055
[keyboard clacking]

15:32.264 --> 15:34.767
[Ressler] So much for the family man.
Who is she?

15:34.850 --> 15:38.395
The BND doesn't know.
I'm running it through NSA databases.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.397
We'll move on this
as soon as we get an ID.

15:40.481 --> 15:44.276
-Is Mr. Cooper coming down?
-He went out. Personal business.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.237
When we're trying to stop a war in space?

15:47.321 --> 15:50.449
-That's melodramatic.
-What would you say this is?

15:50.532 --> 15:53.285
An attempt to gain control
of our space-based communications

15:53.369 --> 15:55.204
which could cripple our defense network,

15:55.287 --> 15:58.958
rendering us powerless
against any number of adversaries.

16:00.542 --> 16:04.463
Yeah. So, like I said,
how could he leave us at a time like this?

16:06.340 --> 16:07.758
"Senator Cooper."

16:08.676 --> 16:10.636
I like the sound of that.

16:10.719 --> 16:13.055
I was hoping you'd think
it sounded ridiculous.

16:13.138 --> 16:16.684
Why, honey? I can't think
of a better man for the job.

16:16.767 --> 16:17.893
Well, there are.

16:17.977 --> 16:21.897
Which makes me wonder why they want me.
There has to be a reason.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.150
I can think of at least three reasons.

16:25.859 --> 16:29.154
You're decent, honest, caring.

16:30.948 --> 16:34.618
Reddington says it is
because I'm morally flexible.

16:35.703 --> 16:38.414
That I can be counted on
to look the other way.

16:38.497 --> 16:42.835
Raymond Reddington is a bad person
and a worse judge of character.

16:43.627 --> 16:48.007
It makes me want to bust,
a man like that judging a man like you.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.759
Hey, how about you don't bust

16:51.343 --> 16:53.303
and focus on what
we'll say to the governor?

16:53.387 --> 16:54.805
Yeah. Ooh.

16:54.888 --> 16:57.766
"Governor Cooper. "
I like the sound of that too.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.103
[chuckles] Almost as much
as "President Cooper."

17:01.186 --> 17:03.022
Now, I love the sound of that.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.697
Senator, may I introduce
Assistant Director Cooper

17:11.780 --> 17:13.157
and his wife, Charlene?

17:13.240 --> 17:14.700
My pleasure to meet you both.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.119
You made a wise choice.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.621
She's as biased as she is blunt.

17:19.705 --> 17:20.914
As she should be.

17:20.998 --> 17:24.001
But you're not here to lobby.
I'm already a fan.

17:24.084 --> 17:26.086
-Please, sit, sit, sit.
-Thank you.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.214
Thank you, dear.

17:29.298 --> 17:32.301
I'm sorry to start this way,
but I'm working a case.

17:32.384 --> 17:35.012
If it breaks, I'll have to step away.

17:35.095 --> 17:36.680
-Sounds serious.
-It is.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.308
Unfortunately,
I can't discuss any of the details.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.185
Marvelous! You're one of the few people

17:41.268 --> 17:44.646
whose access to classified intel
may be less when you become a senator.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.941
We were surprised to hear
you were stepping down.

17:48.025 --> 17:50.277
Well, don't tell anyone, but I'm 68,

17:50.360 --> 17:55.157
and I think it's time to make way
for fresh blood, new ideas.

17:55.240 --> 17:59.411
-But let's talk about you.
-Well, that's my favorite subject, so...

17:59.495 --> 18:00.746
[all laughing]

18:00.829 --> 18:02.623
[jazz music playing over speakers]

18:02.706 --> 18:05.709
It's so counterintuitive,
I never would've considered the lack of--

18:05.793 --> 18:08.253
-Oh, no, no, no!
-Please, please.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.797
I insist.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.758
If I'd known you were paying,

18:12.841 --> 18:14.927
I'd have picked
a much more expensive bottle.

18:15.010 --> 18:17.679
Well, I loved it. What's it called again?

18:17.763 --> 18:19.973
I don't know, some French red

18:20.057 --> 18:23.268
that's just old enough
to go perfectly with chocolate.

18:24.019 --> 18:28.107
I think we've successfully polished off
all the champagne truffles.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.275
-You try the lavender ones?
-I did.

18:30.359 --> 18:34.404
I must say,
I found the lavender to be a little...

18:35.114 --> 18:36.323
too much lavender.

18:36.406 --> 18:38.033
-Yes.
-Right?

18:38.117 --> 18:39.660
It was.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.370
There's not much left here.

18:41.453 --> 18:44.706
You're gonna need to get
something else for your sister.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.584
Maybe an "I heart New York" T-shirt?

18:47.668 --> 18:49.670
Or a Statue of Liberty.

18:49.753 --> 18:53.006
Or an Eiffel Tower.
They also sell those here.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.888
So tell me more about your work.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.807
You said you were in the Navy.

19:01.890 --> 19:04.351
That was a lifetime ago.

19:04.434 --> 19:07.479
Now I have my own business.

19:07.563 --> 19:08.564
What do you do?

19:10.524 --> 19:11.775
I consult.

19:14.444 --> 19:18.240
Data profiling, operational guidance,

19:18.323 --> 19:21.577
client relocation, financial services.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.787
That sounds mysterious.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.582
Who do you consult for?

19:27.332 --> 19:28.709
All sorts.

19:28.792 --> 19:32.296
The past few years,
I've had a government contract.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.590
Threat assessment for the government.

19:35.090 --> 19:37.968
That sounds like more fun
than Cottonwood Falls.

19:38.719 --> 19:42.931
I don't know, Anne. I think
your life sounds rather... balanced.

19:43.473 --> 19:44.683
Thank you.

19:45.642 --> 19:47.227
I like to think it is.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.898
Do you like Alfred Hitchcock?

19:50.981 --> 19:53.400
<i>Rear Window? Strangers on a Train?</i>

19:53.483 --> 19:56.111
I saw <i>The Birds. </i>I didn't like it.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.529
You're a bird-watcher.

19:57.613 --> 20:01.575
Of course you didn't like a movie
about gangs of murderous birds.

20:01.658 --> 20:03.952
What about <i>North by Northwest?</i>

20:04.036 --> 20:08.707
It's playing at the Village East tomorrow,
midnight screening.

20:08.790 --> 20:11.460
-I fly out tomorrow morning.
-Change your flight.

20:14.129 --> 20:17.341
-Is that someone you know?
-Yes. He's a colleague.

20:17.424 --> 20:19.968
Work always seems to find me.

20:21.511 --> 20:23.096
Terribly sorry, Anne.

20:23.180 --> 20:28.185
This has been
the most wonderful afternoon.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.437
But I need to go.

20:30.520 --> 20:33.815
-And you have curtain time to make.
-Yes.

20:35.108 --> 20:37.402
May we offer you a ride
back to the Sheraton?

20:37.486 --> 20:40.155
Oh, no, no, no. I think I'm gonna walk.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.492
But promise me one thing.

20:43.575 --> 20:47.454
That you'll at least consider
changing your flight.

20:48.622 --> 20:51.041
If you do, you'll find me waiting for you

20:51.124 --> 20:55.045
under the marquee at the Village East,

20:55.128 --> 20:57.965
tomorrow at midnight with two tickets

20:58.465 --> 21:00.050
for <i>North by Northwest.</i>

21:01.176 --> 21:03.178
I will certainly think about that.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.305
Well, it's a sincere offer.

21:06.098 --> 21:09.851
Hitch and I will be tickled pink
if you decide to join us.

21:10.727 --> 21:13.522
Thank you for the delicious wine
and chocolates.

21:13.605 --> 21:14.898
Oh, my pleasure.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.025
I'll get our coats.

21:18.944 --> 21:22.281
-Did you speak with Zurich?
-The assets are available.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.950
Then let's make a deal. Thank you.

21:29.329 --> 21:32.916
Task force has done yeoman's work.
You are to be commended.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.586
Appointing him senator
is commendation enough.

21:36.670 --> 21:40.173
If I'm sworn in, I'll need
an incredible amount of guidance.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.551
I'll do whatever I can.
I'm sure you feel the same.

21:42.634 --> 21:43.593
Of course.

21:43.677 --> 21:47.306
Good to know because,
within two weeks of your being sworn in,

21:47.389 --> 21:48.974
you'll vote on the Black Budget.

21:49.057 --> 21:53.228
That's appropriations for everything
from the CIA to the NSA.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.022
The National Reconnaissance Office.

21:55.105 --> 21:57.399
These agencies are vital
to our national security.

21:57.482 --> 22:00.652
What they do, I'm not sure that even you

22:00.736 --> 22:03.697
-are classified to know about.
-I know enough to know their value.

22:03.780 --> 22:07.492
When we vote on the Black Budget,
we vote on a total number.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.244
We don't get to see the line items,

22:09.328 --> 22:12.122
where the money goes,
what programs it pays for.

22:12.205 --> 22:16.543
We're given a total number.
We are told to vote yea or nay.

22:16.626 --> 22:18.920
The number this year is 80 billion.

22:19.004 --> 22:22.132
So I'm asking for your promise
that you will vote yea.

22:22.841 --> 22:25.135
Well, I'm sure I will, but having--

22:25.218 --> 22:27.929
Selecting my replacement is up
to the governor.

22:28.013 --> 22:31.308
But he's agreed not to pick anybody
over my objection.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.852
[cell phone ringing]

22:35.645 --> 22:36.480
I'm so sorry.

22:37.314 --> 22:41.276
No, go. It'll give me time
to get to know your lovely wife better.

22:43.904 --> 22:44.738
Tell me.

22:44.821 --> 22:46.406
We picked up footage

22:46.490 --> 22:49.910
of Greeley canoodling with
a Russian spy named Nina Kurylenko.

22:49.993 --> 22:51.870
Does the Russia desk have anything?

22:51.953 --> 22:54.122
They have Kurylenko landing
in London hours ago.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.792
I want you and Agent Park there ASAP.
How are we on time?

22:56.875 --> 23:00.921
-Bidding closes in seven hours.
-Go. See if Kurylenko knows anything.

23:03.340 --> 23:05.759
-Uh... I have to go.
-[Warwick] No problem.

23:05.842 --> 23:07.928
As long as Charlene stays.

23:08.011 --> 23:11.389
I promised myself a two-martini lunch.
I'm halfway toward my goal.

23:12.808 --> 23:15.560
-I'll call you later.
-All right. Thank you.

23:15.644 --> 23:19.606
Harold, about what I asked for,
I hope you'll agree to it.

23:19.689 --> 23:21.483
I do so want this to work.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.202
Sir, uh, here's what you asked for.

23:34.663 --> 23:38.583
That's it? Just the total amount?
No itemized allocations?

23:38.667 --> 23:41.294
It's called a Black Budget
for a reason, sir.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.921
Thank you, Aram.

23:43.004 --> 23:46.424
The NRO gets its funding this way.
Is this about Greeley?

23:47.801 --> 23:49.427
Close the door on your way out.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.097
Okay.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.727
I need you to do me a favor.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.398
Shedding light on the Black Budget?
That'll be fun.

24:01.481 --> 24:05.318
Send Dembe what you have.
I'll give it a read and make some calls.

24:05.902 --> 24:06.987
As I was saying--

24:07.070 --> 24:09.990
You weren't.
You were raining all over my parade.

24:10.073 --> 24:12.409
I understand what she means to you...

24:12.951 --> 24:17.789
what she represents, but you walked away
from an ordinary life a long time ago.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.082
Dembe, it's a movie.

24:19.166 --> 24:23.211
She doesn't know who you are.
She'll get hurt, Raymond.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.130
You don't want that.

24:25.213 --> 24:29.301
The only person who'll get hurt
by our going to see <i>North by Northwest</i>

24:29.384 --> 24:32.387
is Martin Landau
when he falls off Mount Rushmore.

24:36.474 --> 24:39.936
Now, this damn deal,
let's review the finer points.

24:40.478 --> 24:42.272
[electronic music playing over speakers]

24:42.355 --> 24:45.192
-[Cooper] <i>You're sure it's Kurylenko?</i>
-Sure as we can be.

24:46.693 --> 24:50.197
[Park] I don't want to get too close,
but I'm telling you, it's her.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.074
We're already out of time.
The bidding closed an hour ago.

24:53.158 --> 24:57.704
Move now. If it's her, get her back
to the safe house as quickly as possible.

25:02.334 --> 25:06.713
Don't look now. A woman who's been
watching you, she's headed our way now.

25:06.796 --> 25:09.716
-You got a visual?
-Can't see. Give me a minute.

25:11.968 --> 25:13.470
She's on the move.

25:30.403 --> 25:32.405
[suspenseful music playing]

26:04.312 --> 26:06.815
She's running! Headed toward the alley.

26:11.778 --> 26:14.572
Nina Kurylenko. Nice to meet you.

26:19.411 --> 26:23.248
I've no idea what you're talking about.
My name is Marjorie Ellis.

26:23.331 --> 26:25.834
-A British national.
-You're from England.

26:25.917 --> 26:29.462
And you're from America.
You have no jurisdiction here.

26:30.463 --> 26:33.591
We know about you and Greeley,
the hookups in Berlin.

26:33.675 --> 26:37.345
You're FSB, you turned him,
convinced him to steal classified intel.

26:37.429 --> 26:40.390
So, do us all a favor, drop the act.

26:44.227 --> 26:45.645
[in Russian accent] I have nothing to say.

26:45.729 --> 26:48.398
[Ressler] We're not the people you stiff.
We're the people you talk to.

26:48.481 --> 26:51.860
Because if you don't,
we'll just hand you over to the CIA.

26:51.943 --> 26:54.988
They'll drop you into a hole
that doesn't exist.

26:55.071 --> 26:58.908
Telling us what you know is
the only thing that stands between you

26:58.992 --> 27:00.618
and a deep, dark hole.

27:01.536 --> 27:03.747
I'm supposed to believe
you want to help me?

27:03.830 --> 27:08.501
I don't want to, but I will if it gets us
to Greeley before he sells that intel.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.920
Now, if you help us stop him in time,

27:11.004 --> 27:13.340
I'll escort you to the Russian embassy.

27:13.423 --> 27:14.632
You have my word.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.426
We're not releasing her.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.887
-She's not our priority.
-She's an enemy.

27:18.970 --> 27:21.765
You don't decide when to apply the law
and when to ignore it.

27:21.848 --> 27:24.059
Greeley is about
to compromise national security.

27:24.142 --> 27:26.478
It's worth letting her go to protect that.

27:26.561 --> 27:29.773
You clearly think so.
I doubt Main Justice will agree.

27:30.523 --> 27:32.525
[suspenseful music playing]

27:36.196 --> 27:38.782
In ten minutes,
the CIA will come through that door.

27:38.865 --> 27:41.034
Tell me where he is, I'll handle it.

27:42.285 --> 27:45.038
-Why should I trust you?
-You were assigned to Greeley,

27:45.121 --> 27:47.374
to convince him to betray his country.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.667
Talk to me. You don't have much time.

27:51.336 --> 27:54.422
The intel he stole,
has he sold it to you? To Russia?

27:55.965 --> 27:57.509
He told me what it was

27:57.592 --> 28:00.762
so I could assist
my government in making a bid.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.889
Whether they bid the most or not,

28:02.972 --> 28:05.934
you brought me here
before I could find out.

28:06.768 --> 28:09.896
So you don't know who,
but do you know when or where?

28:12.565 --> 28:14.943
To save yourself, give up Greeley.

28:15.443 --> 28:19.697
I can't help him,
but I can help you, if you help me.

28:21.741 --> 28:25.078
The meeting to sell the intel,
where's it gonna be?

28:28.706 --> 28:29.791
[Cooper] Mongolia?

28:29.874 --> 28:32.127
[Ressler] <i>In four hours,</i>
<i>outside Ulaanbaatar.</i>

28:32.836 --> 28:35.213
-Kurylenko. You believe her?
<i>-I do.</i>

28:35.296 --> 28:37.590
We have to get Greeley
before he enters the country.

28:37.674 --> 28:38.800
He's already there.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.552
-The buyer?
<i>-Kurylenko doesn't know.</i>

28:40.635 --> 28:44.556
Mongolia sits between Russia and China.
My money's on one of them.

28:44.639 --> 28:47.517
Mongolians won't let us roll in
and make arrests.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.352
We can't get there in time anyway.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.187
If we tell the Mongolian government,

28:51.271 --> 28:54.023
we have to reveal
that Greeley's carrying classified intel.

28:54.107 --> 28:56.151
How do we know
they won't read it or copy it?

28:56.234 --> 28:59.529
We can't stop him ourselves
and we can't ask for help.

28:59.612 --> 29:00.613
We're out of options.

29:01.448 --> 29:03.658
-What about the Disposition Matrix?
-[Park] <i>The what?</i>

29:03.742 --> 29:05.660
The federal kill list.

29:05.744 --> 29:10.039
-We should assassinate him?
-We could scramble a drone from Kandahar.

29:10.123 --> 29:13.710
There's a difference between assassination
and targeted killing by the military.

29:13.793 --> 29:17.797
We'd still be executing
an American citizen without due process.

29:17.881 --> 29:20.258
[Park] <i>Due process takes time.</i>
<i>If this is an act of war--</i>

29:20.341 --> 29:22.969
-Is that what this is?
-Are we gonna risk national security

29:23.052 --> 29:24.679
to ask court for permission?

29:24.763 --> 29:25.680
Yes, we are.

29:25.764 --> 29:29.476
I haven't seen the kill list used
like this. Is it possible?

29:29.559 --> 29:34.063
No, but we have to present the facts
to the NSC while there's still time.

29:34.147 --> 29:36.441
Guys, you can't be okay with this.

29:36.524 --> 29:38.610
Look, Aram, we're out of options.

29:39.235 --> 29:41.988
Call the White House.
Let them know I'm on the way.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.120
[dramatic music playing]

29:49.204 --> 29:50.580
[Cooper] Who's in there?

29:50.663 --> 29:52.999
The president's on the line,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs,

29:53.082 --> 29:55.126
principals
from the National Security Council,

29:55.210 --> 29:58.922
that includes the secretary of state
and defense by remote link.

29:59.380 --> 30:03.510
-Is the president ordering a strike?
-They're discussing his authority.

30:07.388 --> 30:10.475
Assistant Director Cooper.
Thanks for your patience.

30:10.558 --> 30:12.685
-We have a few questions.
-Of course.

30:12.769 --> 30:16.105
The targeted killings carried out
in the last 20 years

30:16.189 --> 30:18.191
were connected
to the global war on terror.

30:18.274 --> 30:20.527
-Yes.
-The president's authority derives

30:20.610 --> 30:24.364
from the Authorization to Use
Military Force, passed after 9/11.

30:24.447 --> 30:27.116
Our concern is
that authority doesn't apply.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.285
Greeley is not a known terrorist.

30:29.369 --> 30:33.289
He has no link to al Qaeda, or ISIS,
or any terrorist organization.

30:33.373 --> 30:36.376
He's acting as an individual
for financial gain.

30:36.459 --> 30:37.794
That complicates the matter.

30:37.877 --> 30:39.587
[Ames] Under Article II
of the Constitution,

30:39.671 --> 30:43.466
the president has the power
to defend from imminent attack.

30:43.550 --> 30:46.261
We don't know
how imminent the attack might be.

30:46.344 --> 30:48.555
True. Greeley's not selling a weapon.

30:48.638 --> 30:50.890
He's selling intelligence
that may be used as a weapon.

30:50.974 --> 30:53.142
[Hatch] We're not at war with the buyers.

30:53.226 --> 30:57.397
We haven't declared war. That doesn't mean
an enemy hasn't declared war on us.

30:57.480 --> 31:01.150
If they're buying our intelligence,
we have to assume they intend to use it.

31:01.234 --> 31:05.071
Are we supposed to wait
until North Korea or Iran has attacked us

31:05.154 --> 31:07.657
with our own technology
before we defend ourselves?

31:07.740 --> 31:09.534
[Hatch] <i>Greeley's an American citizen.</i>

31:09.617 --> 31:11.452
<i>He has a right to due process.</i>

31:11.536 --> 31:15.206
[Ames] <i>That right's not absolute.</i>
<i>If he were in D.C., we'd arrest him.</i>

31:15.290 --> 31:18.167
<i>But he made that impossible.</i>
<i>Our people can't get there in time.</i>

31:18.251 --> 31:21.588
<i>The UN Charter requires us</i>
<i>to notify the Mongolians</i>

31:21.671 --> 31:23.548
<i>before executing a strike.</i>

31:23.631 --> 31:26.342
We didn't notify the Pakistanis
before we went after bin Laden.

31:26.426 --> 31:29.762
Notification isn't needed
if the country involved

31:29.846 --> 31:32.056
is unwilling and unable to intervene.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.767
We can't notify the Mongolians, Diane.

31:34.851 --> 31:37.854
We can't let anyone know
that intel's in play.

31:37.937 --> 31:40.648
<i>We also have no extradition treaty.</i>

31:42.567 --> 31:45.737
Mr. President,
we have less than three hours, sir.

31:45.820 --> 31:48.615
If you intend to act, we need to know now.

31:54.370 --> 31:56.998
-[Ressler] <i>Where are you?</i>
-Outside the conference room.

31:57.081 --> 31:59.626
It's almost time.
The Reaper should be in position--

31:59.709 --> 32:01.628
Director Cooper, screen's up.

32:04.339 --> 32:06.341
[dramatic music playing]

32:09.510 --> 32:12.013
That's Greeley's car.
He's en route to the meeting.

32:12.096 --> 32:13.097
[Cooper] How sure are we?

32:13.181 --> 32:15.642
We have confirmation from cameras.

32:15.725 --> 32:19.354
Centcom Command, this is Ames,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

32:19.437 --> 32:20.855
How long to the target?

32:20.939 --> 32:24.233
[commander] <i>Four mikes out. We have</i>
<i>an RQ-180 conducting surveillance</i>

32:24.317 --> 32:25.902
<i>and an MQ-9 moving into position.</i>

32:25.985 --> 32:30.949
We will not go weapons-free until we have
a visual on the target and the buyer.

32:31.032 --> 32:34.243
<i>If someone's moving against us,</i>
<i>I want to know who it is.</i>

32:34.327 --> 32:35.370
[commander] <i>Roger that.</i>

32:35.453 --> 32:37.455
<i>Target appears to be arriving now.</i>

32:38.665 --> 32:42.293
-[Ames] Command, how close can you get us?
-[commander] <i>Target confirmed.</i>

32:42.377 --> 32:46.506
What do we know about the buildings?
We may have collateral damage.

32:46.589 --> 32:49.425
[commander] <i>Unknown. We're working</i>
<i>to identify the occupants.</i>

32:49.509 --> 32:51.803
Any strike needs to happen outside.

32:51.886 --> 32:53.972
We won't kill civilians
or government workers.

32:54.055 --> 32:57.684
Stand by. Two unknown subjects
moving toward Greeley.

32:59.268 --> 33:01.062
[commander] <i>Repositioning for visual.</i>

33:08.736 --> 33:09.862
Oh, my God.

33:11.572 --> 33:12.782
Is that--?

33:12.865 --> 33:14.325
Raymond Reddington.

33:16.369 --> 33:20.206
Mr. Greeley. Or Ogden.
Do you prefer "Ogden"?

33:20.289 --> 33:24.669
[commander] <i>Centcom Command, standing by.</i>
<i>We're in position. Awaiting your orders.</i>

33:24.752 --> 33:25.837
[line ringing]

33:29.549 --> 33:32.010
-You can't do this.
-Say that again.

33:32.093 --> 33:34.804
-Raymond Reddington is a criminal.
-So?

33:34.887 --> 33:37.515
So the president's decision
to authorize this strike

33:37.598 --> 33:40.351
was clearly to protect
against a rival power.

33:40.435 --> 33:44.272
An enemy nation-state intent
on using our technology against us.

33:44.355 --> 33:47.233
Reddington doesn't have an army.
He can't take military action.

33:47.316 --> 33:50.236
Maybe not but he can sell it
to a country that can.

33:50.319 --> 33:52.155
[Greeley] I have to say, Mr. Reddington,

33:52.238 --> 33:55.283
I never imagined
you could raise this kind of capital.

33:55.366 --> 33:57.243
I'm rather surprised myself.

33:57.326 --> 34:01.956
Apparently, I have a phenomenally high
criminal credit score.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.876
Let's not talk here.
Why don't we move inside?

34:04.959 --> 34:07.962
There's a strong argument
that Reddington's presence

34:08.046 --> 34:11.090
-alters our authorization to proceed.
-[Ames] So we do nothing?

34:11.174 --> 34:15.720
We let our intel fall into the hands
of the world's most wanted fugitive?

34:15.803 --> 34:17.847
[commander] <i>General Ames, sir,</i>
<i>they're on the move.</i>

34:18.639 --> 34:21.976
<i>We need a decision, sir.</i>
<i>They're moving out of our sight.</i>

34:22.643 --> 34:23.770
[Ames] Damn it!

34:25.521 --> 34:27.231
Get the president on the line now!

34:27.315 --> 34:30.026
[commander] <i>We have no clear shot.</i>
<i>We've lost visual.</i>

34:30.109 --> 34:31.360
[Ames] Find them.

34:31.444 --> 34:33.905
[commander] <i>We have no assets</i>
<i>on the ground, sir.</i>

34:33.988 --> 34:35.990
<i>There's no way to track them.</i>

34:36.074 --> 34:38.326
You just put every American in danger.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.745
We'll find them, sir. You have my word.

34:40.828 --> 34:43.039
We'll do everything to bring them in.

34:53.341 --> 34:55.218
[dramatic music playing]

34:55.301 --> 34:58.679
The Black Budget.
Here are the results you're looking for.

34:59.514 --> 35:02.016
I know
Reddington acquired Greeley's intel.

35:02.600 --> 35:06.562
I could've prevented that,
but it would've required killing you both.

35:09.607 --> 35:12.151
Are you wondering
if you made the right decision?

35:13.236 --> 35:14.612
How does he do it?

35:15.446 --> 35:17.406
Find out about things that are...

35:18.116 --> 35:19.951
impossible to find out about.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.745
He is a resourceful man.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.289
You are a good one.

35:25.373 --> 35:27.750
Whatever is in there,
I hope it doesn't prevent you

35:27.834 --> 35:29.961
from accepting the governor's offer.

35:30.044 --> 35:32.046
This country needs a man like you.

35:39.512 --> 35:40.596
Director.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.515
Or should I say "senator"?

35:43.015 --> 35:46.561
-Would you give us a moment?
-Well, good news enjoys company.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.604
Then you should definitely go.

35:55.319 --> 35:58.114
-What's this?
-The reason you wanted my promise

35:58.197 --> 35:59.699
and the reason I can't give it.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.451
Then you won't be appointed.

36:02.535 --> 36:05.621
When no one can see how money
gets spent, it can get spent anywhere,

36:05.705 --> 36:08.499
including a no-bid,
$100 million contract to a company

36:08.583 --> 36:11.460
in which your son is a principal owner.

36:11.544 --> 36:13.629
-My son?
-This isn't about him.

36:13.713 --> 36:16.883
This is about you using public money
for private gain.

36:18.259 --> 36:23.723
Whatever you think you have here,
you have because you broke the law.

36:23.806 --> 36:27.268
Earmarks in the Black Budget
are classified.

36:27.351 --> 36:29.228
-Is that a threat?
-It's advice.

36:29.312 --> 36:33.691
Friendly advice that we forget
that we ever met, for your sake.

36:34.358 --> 36:39.488
I thought I had the right man for the job,
but clearly... I was mistaken.

36:49.582 --> 36:53.085
Warwick is a piece of gum
on the bottom of your shoe,

36:53.169 --> 36:57.006
and the Senate,
a wind tunnel of self-indulgence.

36:57.089 --> 36:59.926
What we do is far more important.

37:02.553 --> 37:03.596
Here.

37:05.806 --> 37:09.810
The intel Greeley stole.
I turned out to be the highest bidder.

37:09.894 --> 37:12.897
If your plan was to buy it,
why give us the case?

37:12.980 --> 37:14.607
Don't sell yourself short.

37:14.690 --> 37:18.027
The bureau, on occasion,
can be somewhat helpful.

37:18.110 --> 37:21.113
In this case, as a resale market.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.492
You want to sell us our own intel?

37:24.575 --> 37:27.161
Yes, for 200 million.

37:30.623 --> 37:33.292
One seventy-five.
Friends and family discount.

37:35.044 --> 37:36.504
What did you pay for it?

37:37.463 --> 37:41.676
One fifty. What's a small markup
between family and friends?

37:42.635 --> 37:46.389
I'll see if I can get you 155
for the intel and a thank-you.

37:46.472 --> 37:49.517
<i>We knew Greeley was selling</i>
<i>the intel in Mongolia.</i>

37:49.600 --> 37:52.770
<i>To prevent it, I got the president</i>
<i>to order a drone strike on him</i>

37:52.853 --> 37:54.480
<i>and whoever he was selling to.</i>

37:54.563 --> 37:57.191
-You invoked the federal kill list?
-Yes.

37:57.275 --> 38:00.695
Because you kept your endgame secret,
you were nearly vaporized.

38:01.904 --> 38:05.366
One fifty-five it is. And I thank you.

38:07.368 --> 38:09.161
I'm sorry about the Senate.

38:10.579 --> 38:11.580
He was right.

38:12.748 --> 38:17.378
Because of our relationship,
Warwick assumed I'd be morally ambiguous.

38:17.461 --> 38:19.046
-He assumed wrong.
-Did he?

38:20.506 --> 38:21.716
I'm not so sure.

38:22.758 --> 38:26.721
You accept that the world is gray.
That's a virtue, not a vice.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.890
I know the task force does good work.

38:29.974 --> 38:32.893
People like Greeley are
a threat to the country

38:32.977 --> 38:34.770
and we keep them off the street.

38:34.854 --> 38:36.856
Then I think about what else I do.

38:36.939 --> 38:41.610
Ordering a drone strike on
an American citizen without due process.

38:41.694 --> 38:44.405
Not reporting
Agent Keen's criminal activities.

38:45.156 --> 38:49.577
You've taken calculated risks,
which have been amply rewarded.

38:49.660 --> 38:52.079
Whether that's true, only time will tell.

38:52.580 --> 38:56.542
What I know now is that working
with you has changed me.

38:57.376 --> 38:59.045
It's changed all of us.

38:59.128 --> 39:02.381
None of us are the same people
we were when this began.

39:04.050 --> 39:05.676
I'm not the same either.

39:07.053 --> 39:08.387
I'm better.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.973
I think you are the reason why.

39:12.516 --> 39:16.854
You could've said yes to Warwick,
told him you'd vote his way,

39:16.937 --> 39:20.608
then go back on your word
once you'd been sworn in.

39:21.650 --> 39:23.444
That's what some people would've done.

39:23.527 --> 39:26.030
Hell, that's what most people
I know would've done.

39:26.113 --> 39:27.531
But not you, Harold.

39:28.866 --> 39:32.912
You could have made a promise
that you never intended to keep

39:32.995 --> 39:35.623
and become a United States senator.

39:36.499 --> 39:37.541
But you didn't.

39:38.542 --> 39:41.420
Because your word is your bond.

39:42.546 --> 39:44.423
Very few people can say that.

39:48.552 --> 39:50.096
When you put it like that,

39:50.888 --> 39:53.265
I'm almost glad
I didn't drop a Reaper on your head.

39:54.266 --> 39:56.143
["River Dreams" playing]

39:56.227 --> 39:59.355
What will Charlene do when you tell her
you turned down Warwick?

40:00.356 --> 40:01.399
She'll be sad...

40:02.108 --> 40:03.651
for about ten minutes.

40:03.734 --> 40:05.945
Then she'll shrug, make some popcorn,

40:06.028 --> 40:08.781
and we'll fall asleep
watching an episode of <i>The Chi.</i>

40:09.949 --> 40:10.825
That's it?

40:11.534 --> 40:12.493
That's it.

40:13.452 --> 40:15.454
That's what ordinary people do.

40:15.538 --> 40:18.165
You should try it sometime,
an ordinary life.

40:18.791 --> 40:20.709
It's really quite extraordinary.

40:38.978 --> 40:40.980
[cell phone ringing]

40:44.442 --> 40:45.317
Raymond?

40:45.401 --> 40:48.195
[Raymond] <i>Anne, I am so terribly sorry.</i>

40:48.279 --> 40:52.908
-Is everything okay?
-No. It's not. It's work.

40:54.577 --> 40:57.037
I'm afraid I'm not going
to be able to make it tonight.

40:58.747 --> 40:59.623
Oh.

41:01.208 --> 41:02.126
Okay.

41:03.627 --> 41:04.670
It's not a big deal.

41:04.753 --> 41:08.966
Yes, it is. I asked you to stay,
to change your plans.

41:09.049 --> 41:12.052
Raymond, don't worry. It's okay.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.181
I didn't change my plans.

41:16.056 --> 41:18.058
I just got home a few hours ago.

41:20.060 --> 41:22.688
Oh, I see.

41:27.818 --> 41:30.154
I had such a lovely time together.

41:30.946 --> 41:32.198
Oh, I did too.

41:35.034 --> 41:37.244
Perhaps we'll meet up again sometime.

41:38.329 --> 41:39.371
In the park.

41:39.455 --> 41:43.209
I'll be sure to look
for that fox sparrow for you.

41:43.292 --> 41:44.376
<i>You do that.</i>

41:45.794 --> 41:48.214
-Let me know if you find him.
<i>-I will.</i>

41:51.300 --> 41:52.343
Goodbye, Anne.

41:55.095 --> 41:55.971
Goodbye.

42:22.289 --> 42:24.291
