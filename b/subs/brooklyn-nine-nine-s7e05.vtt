WEBVTT

00:03.796 --> 00:05.464
[elevator bell dings]

00:07.132 --> 00:09.009
[precinct chatter]

00:11.261 --> 00:12.930
Oh, hey, Jake.

00:12.972 --> 00:14.932
What's--what's the deal

00:12.972 --> 00:14.932
with the office today?

00:14.974 --> 00:16.266
It--it feels crazy.

00:16.308 --> 00:17.643
Somebody stole

00:16.308 --> 00:17.643
20 bricks of coke

00:17.685 --> 00:19.186
and some machine guns

00:17.685 --> 00:19.186
from evidence.

00:19.227 --> 00:20.771
What?! It's the first

00:19.227 --> 00:20.771
I'm hearing of it.

00:20.813 --> 00:22.481
Yeah, well,

00:20.813 --> 00:22.481
you just got here, right?

00:22.523 --> 00:24.692
Right. I need you to find

00:22.523 --> 00:24.692
whoever did this

00:24.733 --> 00:26.401
and kill them.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.111
Till they're dead!

00:29.655 --> 00:31.615
Bonkers morning, huh?

00:29.655 --> 00:31.615
So, any idea who did it?

00:31.657 --> 00:33.367
[Holt]

00:31.657 --> 00:33.367
No, but whoever it was

00:33.408 --> 00:35.160
had an intimate knowledge

00:33.408 --> 00:35.160
of our security systems.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.329
It was obviously

00:35.202 --> 00:37.329
an inside job.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.289
-I bet it was Brian.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.289
-Why do you say that?

00:39.331 --> 00:43.210
Because... he once said

00:39.331 --> 00:43.210
he has a hot tub.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.586
You know how that crowd is.

00:44.628 --> 00:46.171
I didn't know

00:44.628 --> 00:46.171
Brian had a hot tub.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.965
-That does sound bad.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.965
-Yeah.

00:48.007 --> 00:49.591
But we have to let the

00:48.007 --> 00:49.591
investigation run its course.

00:49.633 --> 00:52.011
Right now,

00:49.633 --> 00:52.011
everyone's a suspect.

00:52.051 --> 00:54.763
Except for

00:52.051 --> 00:54.763
Hitchcock and Scully.

00:52.051 --> 00:54.763
Whoever did it took the stairs.

00:54.805 --> 00:57.182
What'll happen to the person,

00:54.805 --> 00:57.182
you know, if you find them?

00:57.224 --> 00:58.809
[Holt]

00:57.224 --> 00:58.809
Well, they've committed

00:57.224 --> 00:58.809
several felonies.

00:58.851 --> 01:00.227
Probably looking at, uh,

00:58.851 --> 01:00.227
30-to-life.

01:00.268 --> 01:04.147
So that person

01:00.268 --> 01:04.147
could miss 15 Olympics.

01:04.189 --> 01:05.482
Cool.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.527
I have to go.

01:09.653 --> 01:11.488
They know

01:09.653 --> 01:11.488
the drugs are missing.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.699
They don't suspect me because

01:11.530 --> 01:13.699
I'm playing it super cool.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.116
Now, when is the handoff?

01:15.158 --> 01:18.037
Yes, I'm alone

01:15.158 --> 01:18.037
in the ladies' room.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.121
No one can hear me.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.540
OK, so I know something,

01:21.582 --> 01:23.959
but you can't ask

01:21.582 --> 01:23.959
how I know it.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.336
-Debbie? Took the coke

01:24.001 --> 01:26.336
and the guns.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.336
- It's Debbie.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.756
-[all] Yeah, it's Debbie.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.756
-Acting super suspicious.

01:28.797 --> 01:31.258
[theme song playing]

01:49.443 --> 01:50.986
Debbie, can I see you

01:49.443 --> 01:50.986
in my office?

01:51.028 --> 01:52.947
Yeah, sure.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.947
What's this about?

01:52.988 --> 01:54.615
-We'll talk in my office.

01:52.988 --> 01:54.615
-It'll just take a minute.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.116
Oh. Heh. Wow.

01:56.157 --> 01:58.077
This morning's

01:56.157 --> 01:58.077
full of surprises, huh?

01:58.118 --> 02:00.871
First, that stolen cocaine

01:58.118 --> 02:00.871
that Hot Tub Brian took,

02:00.913 --> 02:03.331
now this unrelated thing

02:00.913 --> 02:03.331
involving me. Huh--

02:03.373 --> 02:05.709
You know what? I think

02:03.373 --> 02:05.709
I'm gonna go make a sandwich

02:05.751 --> 02:08.211
I just--I love sandwiches.

02:05.751 --> 02:08.211
I'll meet you in there.

02:08.253 --> 02:10.380
Guilty of loving sandwiches,

02:08.253 --> 02:10.380
right? Ha ha ha!

02:10.422 --> 02:11.673
-Debbie?-

02:10.422 --> 02:11.673
-[Debbie] Hmm.

02:11.715 --> 02:13.425
What do I want

02:11.715 --> 02:13.425
in my sandwich?

02:13.467 --> 02:15.427
Let's see.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.427
Definitely ham, cheese,

02:15.469 --> 02:16.595
baking soda for sure,

02:16.637 --> 02:17.930
French vanilla creamer,

02:17.972 --> 02:19.180
ooh, orange chicken.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.265
[laughs] Aaah!

02:20.307 --> 02:22.309
-Debbie! Ooh!

02:20.307 --> 02:22.309
-[grunts]

02:22.350 --> 02:25.687
-You really thought

02:22.350 --> 02:25.687
you'd get away with it?

02:22.350 --> 02:25.687
-Damn, Scully!

02:25.729 --> 02:27.230
I was planning on eating

02:25.729 --> 02:27.230
that orange chicken later!

02:27.272 --> 02:28.607
[Terry]

02:27.272 --> 02:28.607
Is that why you took her down?

02:28.649 --> 02:30.191
Do you even know about

02:28.649 --> 02:30.191
the missing cocaine?

02:30.233 --> 02:31.860
Cocaine?

02:31.902 --> 02:33.570
So we don't know where Debbie

02:31.902 --> 02:33.570
has hidden the drugs.

02:33.612 --> 02:35.530
We searched her car,

02:33.612 --> 02:35.530
her apartment--

02:35.572 --> 02:37.198
we even tried

02:35.572 --> 02:37.198
the location data on her phone,

02:37.240 --> 02:38.784
but she was smart,

02:37.240 --> 02:38.784
she had it turned off.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.077
Or her battery died.

02:40.119 --> 02:41.536
According to

02:40.119 --> 02:41.536
her Screen Time app,

02:41.578 --> 02:42.997
she plays five hours a day

02:41.578 --> 02:42.997
of a game

02:43.038 --> 02:44.999
called "Cool Girl in School."

02:45.040 --> 02:46.333
I love "CGIS."

02:46.374 --> 02:47.835
I just made captain

02:46.374 --> 02:47.835
of the color guard.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.003
Junior year's looking up.

02:49.044 --> 02:50.420
[Terry]

02:49.044 --> 02:50.420
The coke Debbie took

02:50.462 --> 02:51.755
was evidence

02:50.462 --> 02:51.755
against Silvio Nucci.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.381
Now, he wanted it gone,

02:53.423 --> 02:54.925
and I think he got Debbie

02:53.423 --> 02:54.925
to do his dirty work.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.760
I'm sorry,

02:54.967 --> 02:56.760
you think Debbie is working

02:56.802 --> 02:59.054
with notorious crime boss

02:56.802 --> 02:59.054
Silvio Nucci?

02:59.096 --> 03:00.806
The same Debbie who has

02:59.096 --> 03:00.806
a denim jacket

03:00.848 --> 03:02.808
-that says "Rock 'n Roll"?

03:00.848 --> 03:02.808
-It was her. I heard her

03:02.850 --> 03:04.893
-setting up a drop.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.893
-And why were you

03:02.850 --> 03:04.893
in the women's room?

03:04.935 --> 03:06.520
It wasn't for a gross reason.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.355
The men's room was occupied,

03:06.561 --> 03:08.355
and I had to dump out.

03:08.396 --> 03:10.482
Well, as long as

03:08.396 --> 03:10.482
it wasn't for a gross reason.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.317
We know you did it, Debbie.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.987
Just tell me the truth.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.987
Let me be your friend here.

03:15.029 --> 03:17.489
Thank you, but I already have

03:15.029 --> 03:17.489
plenty of friends.

03:17.531 --> 03:21.160
Gil, Finn, Goldie, Bubbles--

03:21.200 --> 03:23.787
Those are clearly just

03:21.200 --> 03:23.787
the names of your pet fish.

03:23.829 --> 03:25.330
OK, fine.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.374
They're my fish.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.710
And I took the drugs.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.920
I'm sorry.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.920
I screwed everything up.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.922
OK, this is good.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.590
Now just tell me

03:33.964 --> 03:35.590
why you did it.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.676
Because I need my drugs.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.636
I'm a big time drug girl.

03:39.678 --> 03:41.638
Debbie,

03:39.678 --> 03:41.638
I don't think that's true.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.307
I think Silvio Nucci

03:41.680 --> 03:44.307
forced you to do this

03:44.349 --> 03:46.060
-against your will.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.060
-Nucci?

03:46.101 --> 03:48.687
[laughing]

03:48.729 --> 03:51.857
What?!

03:48.729 --> 03:51.857
[laughs]

03:51.899 --> 03:53.942
She sat there and laughed

03:51.899 --> 03:53.942
for 40 minutes.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.319
She's never gonna turn

03:53.984 --> 03:56.319
on Nucci. I'll bet

03:53.984 --> 03:56.319
she's heard stories

03:56.361 --> 03:58.363
of what he does to people

03:56.361 --> 03:58.363
who testify against him.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.489
Man, I wish there

03:58.405 --> 03:59.489
was something we could do

03:59.531 --> 04:00.908
-to help her.

03:59.531 --> 04:00.908
-Why?

04:00.949 --> 04:02.367
Well, I know

04:00.949 --> 04:02.367
she committed a crime,

04:02.409 --> 04:03.952
but she's clearly

04:02.409 --> 04:03.952
in over her head.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.495
I don't think she's actually

04:03.994 --> 04:05.495
a bad person.

04:05.537 --> 04:07.122
She's a grown-up

04:05.537 --> 04:07.122
who made her own decisions,

04:07.164 --> 04:08.540
and now she has to suffer

04:07.164 --> 04:08.540
the consequences.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.042
You might not get it,

04:08.582 --> 04:10.042
but personally,

04:10.084 --> 04:11.543
I relate to someone

04:10.084 --> 04:11.543
who made a mistake

04:11.585 --> 04:13.045
and can't find their way

04:11.585 --> 04:13.045
out of it.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.713
When I was younger,

04:13.087 --> 04:14.713
I was thoroughly hoodwinked

04:14.755 --> 04:17.007
by the so-called good people

04:14.755 --> 04:17.007
at Columbia CD Club.

04:17.049 --> 04:20.427
Next thing you know,

04:17.049 --> 04:20.427
I had 16 copies

04:17.049 --> 04:20.427
of Blind Melon's first album.

04:20.468 --> 04:22.303
In high school,

04:20.468 --> 04:22.303
I broke into a bunch of houses

04:22.345 --> 04:23.972
-and wound up in juvie.

04:22.345 --> 04:23.972
-What? That's terrible.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.724
I mean, yeah,

04:24.014 --> 04:25.724
Rosa's is a little worse.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.392
I was in ballet school,

04:25.766 --> 04:27.392
and there was so much pressure

04:27.434 --> 04:29.019
to be perfect all the time

04:27.434 --> 04:29.019
that I just snapped.

04:29.061 --> 04:30.687
If I hadn't been underage,

04:29.061 --> 04:30.687
I would've gone to prison.

04:30.729 --> 04:32.189
It's all the more reason

04:30.729 --> 04:32.189
you should

04:32.231 --> 04:33.774
have sympathy for Debbie

04:32.231 --> 04:33.774
and understand

04:33.815 --> 04:35.150
-why she could use our help.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.150
-Nobody helped me.

04:35.192 --> 04:36.693
My parents kicked me

04:35.192 --> 04:36.693
out of the house

04:36.735 --> 04:38.195
-and told me I was on my own.

04:36.735 --> 04:38.195
-I'm so sorry

04:38.237 --> 04:39.404
you had to go through

04:38.237 --> 04:39.404
all that alone, Rosa.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.948
No, it was a good thing.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.033
I had to face my mistakes

04:40.989 --> 04:43.033
and fix them by myself.

04:43.075 --> 04:44.785
It made me a stronger person.

04:43.075 --> 04:44.785
So, no, I don't think

04:44.826 --> 04:46.494
-we should take pity on Debbie.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.494
-OK, fine.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.455
But even so,

04:46.536 --> 04:48.455
wouldn't you rather take down

04:48.496 --> 04:50.331
Silvio Nucci,

04:48.496 --> 04:50.331
a known crime boss,

04:50.373 --> 04:51.666
instead of Debbie Fogle,

04:51.708 --> 04:53.418
a rewards member

04:51.708 --> 04:53.418
at JOANN Fabrics?

04:53.460 --> 04:55.170
Yeah, but Debbie's not gonna

04:53.460 --> 04:55.170
testify against Nucci.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.547
You may be right.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.547
And that's why...

04:57.589 --> 04:59.633
we're gonna catch him

04:57.589 --> 04:59.633
in the act.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.009
Brace yourselves, everyone.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.053
We're about to pop that Nucci.

05:03.095 --> 05:04.846
Apologies, that was

05:03.095 --> 05:04.846
inappropriate in the workplace.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.557
But in my defense, that was

05:04.888 --> 05:07.557
a song that I learned about

05:07.599 --> 05:10.310
from Columbia House, Rosa.

05:10.351 --> 05:12.187
Mm.

05:10.351 --> 05:12.187
All right, here's the plan.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.274
Why are we going this way?

05:13.688 --> 05:15.274
The bathroom's back there.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.358
I'm breaking you out.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.358
I work for Silvio Nucci.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.694
Oh, my God.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.694
You work for Nucci? Me too!

05:19.736 --> 05:21.780
Way too loud, Debbie.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.615
OK. Press yourself

05:21.822 --> 05:23.615
against the wall

05:23.657 --> 05:25.700
to avoid being seen

05:23.657 --> 05:25.700
by the camera.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.494
Why didn't she do it

05:25.742 --> 05:27.494
with her back to the wall?

05:27.535 --> 05:29.204
Face first seems like

05:27.535 --> 05:29.204
such a mistake.

05:29.246 --> 05:31.248
[tires screeching]

05:31.290 --> 05:32.791
-Oh, no, they found us!

05:31.290 --> 05:32.791
-No, no, no, Debbie.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.001
Rosa's on Nucci's payroll, too.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.919
-She's getting us out of here.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.919
-Oh.

05:35.961 --> 05:38.088
-Debbie. Trunk. Now.

05:35.961 --> 05:38.088
-Sorry, it's a little tight

05:35.961 --> 05:38.088
in there.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.381
Oh, I'm not picky.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.381
I don't need light or oxygen.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.009
I'm kind of like

05:40.423 --> 05:42.009
a low-maintenance plant.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.178
-Ooh, like a succulent.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.178
-That's great, Debbie.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.846
-[Debbie] My mom

05:44.219 --> 05:45.846
always said that--

05:44.219 --> 05:45.846
-But the trunk is closing

05:45.887 --> 05:47.306
on its own, it's definitely

05:45.887 --> 05:47.306
not me slamming it.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.809
[Debbie] So you guys

05:48.974 --> 05:50.809
are gonna stay here with me?

05:50.851 --> 05:52.519
Nucci thought we could

05:50.851 --> 05:52.519
help you guard the coke.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.062
Oh, I can handle it.

05:54.104 --> 05:55.438
I'm pretty tough.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.982
I take self-defense

05:55.480 --> 05:56.982
at the women's gym.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.817
Hi-yah! Hi-yah!

05:58.859 --> 06:00.610
Oh, neat. You actually

05:58.859 --> 06:00.610
say the words "hi-yah,"

06:00.652 --> 06:02.112
like Miss Piggy.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.530
So when's Nucci coming

06:02.154 --> 06:03.530
to pick up the coke?

06:03.571 --> 06:05.532
Uh, could be hours,

06:03.571 --> 06:05.532
could be days.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.617
-Days?

06:05.573 --> 06:07.617
-I don't know.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.617
Nucci just said

06:07.659 --> 06:09.661
to wait by this burner phone.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.661
He said he always works

06:07.659 --> 06:09.661
like that.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.163
[Jake]

06:09.703 --> 06:11.163
Right, of course.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.207
We have so many inside jokes

06:11.205 --> 06:13.207
about it.

06:13.248 --> 06:15.625
I can imagine.

06:13.248 --> 06:15.625
He is pretty funny.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.919
He's always like,

06:15.667 --> 06:17.919
"Debbie, if you mess this up,

06:17.961 --> 06:20.214
I'm gonna gut you like a fish."

06:17.961 --> 06:20.214
What? [laughs]

06:20.255 --> 06:21.715
So he threatened you.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.217
-That's why you went dirty.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.217
-[Debbie] No.

06:23.258 --> 06:25.135
He offered me a million

06:23.258 --> 06:25.135
dollars.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.469
I had no choice.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.096
My dad is really sick,

06:26.511 --> 06:28.096
and he needed

06:28.138 --> 06:29.890
this expensive

06:28.138 --> 06:29.890
experimental surgery.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.766
-Ahh.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.766
-[Debbie] What about you guys?

06:31.808 --> 06:33.601
-How did he turn you?

06:31.808 --> 06:33.601
-Well, I've been dirty

06:33.643 --> 06:35.854
long before Nucci

06:33.643 --> 06:35.854
came onto the scene.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.356
I do a ton of coke.

06:37.438 --> 06:38.940
They call me Mr. Springtime

06:38.982 --> 06:41.109
because of how fast

06:38.982 --> 06:41.109
I make the snow disappear.

06:41.151 --> 06:44.029
Wow! I've never even

06:41.151 --> 06:44.029
had a nickname.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.907
I mean, I guess people

06:44.071 --> 06:46.907
do call me, "Hey, lady."

06:46.948 --> 06:49.408
Right, well, I'm gonna

06:46.948 --> 06:49.408
let the Nine-Nine know

06:46.948 --> 06:49.408
we're looking for you.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.286
You know, so those idiots

06:49.450 --> 06:51.286
don't think we broke you out.

06:51.328 --> 06:52.954
Ooh, you think

06:51.328 --> 06:52.954
they're idiots?

06:52.996 --> 06:54.331
[Jake]

06:52.996 --> 06:54.331
Oh, yeah, big time.

06:54.373 --> 06:55.623
I mean, Holt's a blowhard,

06:55.665 --> 06:57.334
Jeffords is all brawn,

06:55.665 --> 06:57.334
no brains.

06:57.376 --> 06:59.086
Boyle's a laughing stock,

06:57.376 --> 06:59.086
Amy's just the worst.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.670
I mean, she thinks

06:59.127 --> 07:00.670
she so smart and so pretty

07:00.712 --> 07:02.256
and she makes me feel good

07:00.712 --> 07:02.256
about the world

07:02.297 --> 07:03.924
-and my place in it, and she--

07:02.297 --> 07:03.924
-[clears throat]

07:03.965 --> 07:05.550
--smells like [bleep].

07:03.965 --> 07:05.550
We've all smelled her.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.635
Rosa, let's go outside.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.470
Hey, you know that

07:07.677 --> 07:09.470
was Undercover Jake

07:09.512 --> 07:10.972
-talking in there, right?

07:09.512 --> 07:10.972
-Relax, man.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.682
So you're not gonna tell Amy

07:11.014 --> 07:12.682
what I said?

07:12.724 --> 07:14.601
Oh, no, I definitely am.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.601
I'm saying relax because

07:14.642 --> 07:16.728
-there's no way

07:14.642 --> 07:16.728
you can stop me.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.728
-Damn it. Did you at least

07:16.770 --> 07:18.605
text the Nine-Nine and tell 'em

07:16.770 --> 07:18.605
we don't know when

07:16.770 --> 07:18.605
the handoff is?

07:18.646 --> 07:20.690
Yeah, but man,

07:18.646 --> 07:20.690
I don't like this.

07:18.646 --> 07:20.690
We found the drugs,

07:20.732 --> 07:22.234
-we should just forget about

07:20.732 --> 07:22.234
Nucci and take Debbie in.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.234
-What?

07:22.276 --> 07:23.944
Nucci is the real bad guy

07:22.276 --> 07:23.944
here.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.862
And you heard Debbie,

07:23.985 --> 07:25.862
she's only doing this

07:25.904 --> 07:27.197
to get the money

07:25.904 --> 07:27.197
for her dad's surgery.

07:27.239 --> 07:29.032
There are other ways

07:27.239 --> 07:29.032
to get money.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.951
-She could've gone to a bank.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.951
-Right. And she's White.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.036
She definitely would've

07:30.992 --> 07:33.036
gotten approved.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.036
Terrific point.

07:33.078 --> 07:35.330
-That's not what I was saying.

07:33.078 --> 07:35.330
-Ah, we were both thinking it.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.332
Anyways, it doesn't matter.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.332
Our plan is working.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.332
What are you worried about?

07:37.374 --> 07:39.500
There's a loose cannon

07:37.374 --> 07:39.500
in there with two machine guns.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.253
She's not a loose cannon.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.546
I saw her apologize to a chair

07:41.295 --> 07:43.546
after bumping into it.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.425
Trust me, we are not gonna have

07:43.588 --> 07:46.425
any problems with Debbie.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.761
Hey, Jake, guess what?

07:46.466 --> 07:49.761
You made cocaine sound so cool,

07:46.466 --> 07:49.761
I decided to try it.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.889
But I didn't wanna overdo it,

07:49.803 --> 07:52.889
so I only did, like,

07:49.803 --> 07:52.889
a tiny little toot.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.557
Then I didn't feel

07:52.931 --> 07:54.557
anything, so I did, like,

07:54.599 --> 07:56.643
a little bit more,

07:54.599 --> 07:56.643
and I still didn't

07:54.599 --> 07:56.643
feel anything,

07:56.684 --> 07:58.728
so then I did a lot more,

07:56.684 --> 07:58.728
and then I felt it,

07:56.684 --> 07:58.728
like, I really felt it,

07:58.770 --> 08:00.563
so then I did a couple more,

07:58.770 --> 08:00.563
like, big-ass toots.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.023
Why do you guys

08:00.605 --> 08:02.023
keep ducking behind the bed?

08:02.065 --> 08:03.691
Because you keep

08:02.065 --> 08:03.691
pointing those guns at us!

08:03.733 --> 08:05.693
Oh, my God!

08:03.733 --> 08:05.693
Do not worry about it!

08:05.735 --> 08:07.237
It's totally fine!

08:07.279 --> 08:09.948
We need to find out

08:07.279 --> 08:09.948
how Nucci got to Debbie.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.366
Fortunately, it turns out

08:11.408 --> 08:13.118
she kept

08:11.408 --> 08:13.118
a fairly comprehensive diary.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.620
As a power journaler,

08:13.160 --> 08:15.620
I think we can hold off

08:15.662 --> 08:17.205
on using the word

08:15.662 --> 08:17.205
"comprehensive."

08:17.247 --> 08:18.915
Oh, damn, that's comprehensive.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.751
These are all

08:18.957 --> 08:21.751
just from this<i> year?</i>

08:21.793 --> 08:23.628
This one is labeled

08:21.793 --> 08:23.628
August 21st.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.798
"Morning."

08:23.670 --> 08:26.798
This one is August

08:23.670 --> 08:26.798
21st "Evening."

08:26.840 --> 08:29.509
This entire diary is about

08:26.840 --> 08:29.509
an episode of<i> House Hunters</i> .

08:29.550 --> 08:31.011
This is gonna take forever.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.262
I actually took

08:31.052 --> 08:32.262
a speed reading course.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.014
I tested at 800 WPM.

08:34.055 --> 08:36.683
That's pathetic.

08:34.055 --> 08:36.683
I tested at 802.

08:36.724 --> 08:38.101
That's pretty close

08:36.724 --> 08:38.101
to Holt's score.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.394
No, no, 802's

08:38.143 --> 08:39.394
incredible.

08:39.436 --> 08:40.895
She powned me.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.023
I read the entire

08:40.937 --> 08:43.023
Urban Dictionary

08:43.064 --> 08:45.108
so I could converse with

08:43.064 --> 08:45.108
the other uniformed officers.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.194
Finished it

08:45.150 --> 08:47.194
in 47 minutes.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.612
I've never been so attracted

08:47.235 --> 08:49.612
to a gay man before,

08:49.654 --> 08:51.365
and I dated several in college.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.283
Shall we have a read-off,

08:51.406 --> 08:53.283
Santiago?

08:53.325 --> 08:55.452
-We don't have finger guards.

08:53.325 --> 08:55.452
-So we do it raw.

08:55.494 --> 08:58.038
[Terry]

08:55.494 --> 08:58.038
OK, I normally

08:55.494 --> 08:58.038
don't encourage

08:58.079 --> 08:59.456
such childish competitions,

08:59.498 --> 09:01.291
but this might help

08:59.498 --> 09:01.291
things go faster.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.126
My only question is, Holt,

09:03.168 --> 09:04.711
are you sure your old-ass eyes

09:03.168 --> 09:04.711
are up to the challenge?

09:04.752 --> 09:06.505
I know you're just trying

09:04.752 --> 09:06.505
to motivate me,

09:06.546 --> 09:07.755
but these old-ass eyes

09:07.797 --> 09:10.300
will be reading your tombstone,

09:07.797 --> 09:10.300
son.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.012
Oh, we needed more light

09:12.010 --> 09:14.012
in this place.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.764
Now I can finally think,

09:14.054 --> 09:16.764
and the ideas are, like,

09:14.054 --> 09:16.764
flowing out of me.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.059
OK, what about this one?

09:16.806 --> 09:19.059
It's hamburgers,

09:19.100 --> 09:20.560
but the pickles are coins.

09:20.601 --> 09:22.187
Still feel bad for her

09:20.601 --> 09:22.187
now that she's a cokehead?

09:22.229 --> 09:23.897
She's not a cokehead.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.897
She's an innocent girl

09:23.938 --> 09:26.107
in a stressful situation

09:23.938 --> 09:26.107
who did cocaine one time

09:26.149 --> 09:27.567
and will probably

09:26.149 --> 09:27.567
never do it again.

09:27.608 --> 09:28.985
Whoo!

09:27.608 --> 09:28.985
Guess who just did more coke?

09:29.027 --> 09:30.320
This is my thing now!

09:30.362 --> 09:32.406
-[phone beeps]

09:30.362 --> 09:32.406
-Ooh! OK.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.157
-Is it Nucci?

09:32.447 --> 09:34.157
-Yes.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.201
He wants to know if I can

09:34.199 --> 09:36.201
do the handoff in two hours.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.869
Um, I'm gonna tell him no,

09:37.911 --> 09:40.288
because I'm having so much fun

09:37.911 --> 09:40.288
with my new best friends,

09:40.330 --> 09:41.706
-Jake and Rosa.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.706
-Ah, no, no, no.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.542
Don't mention us.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.542
You know, because

09:43.583 --> 09:45.293
you're supposed to be working,

09:43.583 --> 09:45.293
not enjoying yourself.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.337
Right, just keep it short.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.337
Say two hours is great.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.672
That's very smart,

09:47.379 --> 09:49.672
and I'm gonna send him

09:49.714 --> 09:52.092
my favorite GIF

09:49.714 --> 09:52.092
of Mr. Bean giving a thumbs up.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.594
Oh, Mr. Bean.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.594
What a stud.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.304
Hey Rosa, what would you do

09:56.346 --> 09:58.181
if you could do anything

09:56.346 --> 09:58.181
to Mr. Bean?

09:58.223 --> 10:00.392
-Nothing.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.392
-[Jake] Come on, Rosa.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.018
Don't be shy.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.018
Say what you would do

10:02.060 --> 10:04.396
to international sex symbol

10:02.060 --> 10:04.396
Mr. Bean's body.

10:04.438 --> 10:07.107
Fine. I would take

10:04.438 --> 10:07.107
a very large glass...

10:07.148 --> 10:11.236
[sustained bleep]

10:11.278 --> 10:12.904
...and let himself out.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.155
-I see.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.155
-[Debbie] Wow.

10:14.197 --> 10:15.823
Um, I just have one quick note.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.326
Mr. Bean never...

10:15.865 --> 10:18.326
[bleep]

10:18.368 --> 10:20.078
-...beg for mercy.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.078
-Ah, great note, Debbie.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.704
The point is, we all think

10:20.120 --> 10:21.704
Mr. Bean is sexy as hell

10:21.746 --> 10:23.164
and wish we looked

10:21.746 --> 10:23.164
exactly like him.

10:23.206 --> 10:25.125
-You're closer than you think.

10:23.206 --> 10:25.125
-Hmm?

10:25.166 --> 10:27.335
Oh, hey, Rosa, it's not

10:25.166 --> 10:27.335
that you're a third wheel

10:25.166 --> 10:27.335
or anything,

10:27.377 --> 10:28.795
it's just that

10:27.377 --> 10:28.795
we're out of ice,

10:28.836 --> 10:30.880
so could you go get us

10:28.836 --> 10:30.880
some more ice, please?

10:30.922 --> 10:33.007
Hey, well,

10:30.922 --> 10:33.007
this is full of ice, but, yeah.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.051
I'll hit up the Nine-Nine.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.429
You've actually

10:35.093 --> 10:37.429
been texting the Nine-Nine

10:35.093 --> 10:37.429
a lot, haven't you?

10:37.471 --> 10:39.847
Yeah, to make sure

10:37.471 --> 10:39.847
our cover's intact,

10:37.471 --> 10:39.847
and so they don't figure out

10:39.889 --> 10:41.849
-that we're dirty.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.849
-Is that what's really going

10:39.889 --> 10:41.849
on?

10:41.891 --> 10:43.684
'Cause I feel like

10:41.891 --> 10:43.684
there's something

10:41.891 --> 10:43.684
you're not telling me?

10:43.726 --> 10:45.312
I feel like all that coke

10:43.726 --> 10:45.312
is making you paranoid.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.938
No,<i> you're</i> paranoid.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.356
Now, don't you dare

10:46.980 --> 10:48.356
take another step.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.150
[chuckles] OK, Debbie,

10:48.398 --> 10:50.150
what are you doing?

10:50.191 --> 10:52.068
-Give me your phone.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.068
-That's it.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.861
Debbie Fogle,

10:52.110 --> 10:53.861
you are under arrest.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.696
What? Oh, my God,

10:53.903 --> 10:55.696
are you not really dirty?

10:55.738 --> 10:57.949
No. And I'll be taking

10:55.738 --> 10:57.949
that gun.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.327
-Hi-yah!

10:57.991 --> 11:00.327
-[both grunting]

11:00.368 --> 11:03.037
OK, so the women's gym

11:00.368 --> 11:03.037
and the cocaine

11:03.079 --> 11:05.540
have given Debbie superpowers.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.540
Cool.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.750
[rapidly] Cool-cool- cool-

11:05.582 --> 11:07.750
cool-cool-cool-cool-cool-cool-

11:05.582 --> 11:07.750
cool-cool-cool-cool-cool-cool.

11:09.710 --> 11:12.671
You're making a big mistake,

11:09.710 --> 11:12.671
Debbie. This isn't gonna work.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.633
I'm such a terrible

11:12.713 --> 11:14.633
judge of character.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.259
I was wrong about Rosa,

11:16.301 --> 11:18.178
I missed all the signs

11:16.301 --> 11:18.178
with my cousin Jared.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.847
-The sandwich guy.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.847
-What is wrong with me?

11:20.888 --> 11:22.265
Nothing,

11:20.888 --> 11:22.265
you're just coming down

11:22.307 --> 11:23.766
from the many handfuls

11:22.307 --> 11:23.766
of coke you did.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.310
Right. I'm so dumb.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.310
I'm such an idiot.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.936
I'm dumb!

11:26.978 --> 11:29.022
Hey, why don't you let me

11:26.978 --> 11:29.022
hold your gun for you,

11:29.063 --> 11:30.898
and then you can hit yourself

11:29.063 --> 11:30.898
in the face with your fist

11:30.940 --> 11:32.651
like a normal person

11:30.940 --> 11:32.651
having a mental breakdown.

11:32.691 --> 11:34.319
I can't give you my gun.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.945
You'll probably try

11:34.361 --> 11:35.945
and arrest me.

11:35.987 --> 11:38.281
Debbie, I'm not like Rosa.

11:35.987 --> 11:38.281
Here, check my phone.

11:38.323 --> 11:41.493
I haven't been texting

11:38.323 --> 11:41.493
the Nine-Nine.

11:38.323 --> 11:41.493
I have nothing to hide.

11:41.535 --> 11:44.496
I don't know, there are

11:41.535 --> 11:44.496
a lot of sweet messages

11:41.535 --> 11:44.496
between you and Amy.

11:44.538 --> 11:47.332
-I thought you said

11:44.538 --> 11:47.332
she stinks like [bleep].

11:44.538 --> 11:47.332
-She does!

11:47.374 --> 11:48.791
Prove it.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.791
Describe her stink to me.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.210
Don't think about it,

11:48.833 --> 11:50.210
just say it.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.752
Bad mayo, three-day-old

11:50.251 --> 11:51.752
macaroni salad.

11:51.794 --> 11:55.298
OK. I buy it.

11:51.794 --> 11:55.298
I trust you.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.758
-Why'd you do that?

11:55.340 --> 11:57.758
-Rosa probably told

11:55.340 --> 11:57.758
the Nine-Nine

11:57.800 --> 11:59.927
that you're corrupt,

11:57.800 --> 11:59.927
and they could use

11:57.800 --> 11:59.927
your phone to track us

11:59.969 --> 12:01.388
-to the new drop site.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.388
-Oh.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.847
Right. Smart.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.723
Hey, should I drive?

12:02.889 --> 12:04.723
You know, that way,

12:04.765 --> 12:06.393
you could take a nap and get

12:04.765 --> 12:06.393
the coke out of your system,

12:06.434 --> 12:07.852
-[Debbie snorting]

12:06.434 --> 12:07.852
-and we'll both be calm and--

12:07.894 --> 12:09.312
-and you just did a bunch more.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.312
-I did!

12:09.354 --> 12:12.524
I'm the King of New York!

12:09.354 --> 12:12.524
I'm driving! Whoo!

12:14.901 --> 12:17.987
-So how's it going?

12:14.901 --> 12:17.987
-What do you want, Terry?

12:18.029 --> 12:19.947
Or are you just here

12:18.029 --> 12:19.947
to fan some more flames?

12:19.989 --> 12:22.325
No, I'm just here

12:19.989 --> 12:22.325
to see who's losing

12:22.367 --> 12:24.785
and therefore

12:22.367 --> 12:24.785
has to wear this hat I made

12:24.827 --> 12:27.038
that says, "More Stupider."

12:24.827 --> 12:27.038
[laughs]

12:27.080 --> 12:29.082
Fine, yeah,

12:27.080 --> 12:29.082
I'm fanning flames.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.709
Fan, fan, fan, fan, fan,

12:29.123 --> 12:30.709
Santiago.

12:30.749 --> 12:34.003
Don't call her Santiago,

12:30.749 --> 12:34.003
call her Virginia Slim.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.715
-Because I'm smoking her.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.715
-Damn, Ray!

12:36.755 --> 12:38.883
You guys are moving fast,

12:36.755 --> 12:38.883
but there's no way

12:38.925 --> 12:41.094
you're actually

12:38.925 --> 12:41.094
comprehending<i> anything.</i>

12:41.135 --> 12:43.263
I'm taking my time

12:41.135 --> 12:43.263
and reading deliberately,

12:43.304 --> 12:45.932
and you know what they say,

12:43.304 --> 12:45.932
slow and steady wins the race.

12:45.973 --> 12:48.309
Pssh! Classic reg-reader

12:45.973 --> 12:48.309
bullcrap.

12:48.351 --> 12:49.561
Yeah, what are you

12:48.351 --> 12:49.561
gonna say next,

12:49.603 --> 12:51.187
that you read to relax?

12:51.229 --> 12:55.108
[Amy, Holt laughing heartily]

12:56.984 --> 12:58.236
[both sigh]

12:58.278 --> 12:59.696
[Debbie] This is so much better

12:59.738 --> 13:01.281
than that dump

12:59.738 --> 13:01.281
of a hotel, right?

13:01.322 --> 13:02.657
[sniffs] This place

13:01.322 --> 13:02.657
has six chimneys.

13:02.699 --> 13:03.950
Uh, hey, Debbie,

13:02.699 --> 13:03.950
whose house is this?

13:03.991 --> 13:05.410
Oh, it's mine.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.410
I own it, um,

13:05.452 --> 13:06.953
until 11:00 a.m. on Monday.

13:06.994 --> 13:08.246
We have to be out by then,

13:08.288 --> 13:10.290
or it's another $45,000

13:08.288 --> 13:10.290
to Airbnb.

13:10.331 --> 13:12.667
But until then,

13:10.331 --> 13:12.667
I'm a mansion girl.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.252
What happened

13:12.709 --> 13:14.252
to using the money

13:14.294 --> 13:15.545
for your father's surgery?

13:14.294 --> 13:15.545
Was that a lie?

13:15.587 --> 13:17.213
No. My dad really is sick,

13:17.255 --> 13:19.132
but I found out this morning

13:17.255 --> 13:19.132
that my stupid brother Derek

13:19.173 --> 13:20.550
already paid for his surgery.

13:20.592 --> 13:21.926
He thinks he so great

13:20.592 --> 13:21.926
'cause he's, like,

13:21.968 --> 13:23.886
a big shot lawyer,

13:21.968 --> 13:23.886
and he has a family,

13:23.928 --> 13:25.346
and he's not afraid of ghosts.

13:25.388 --> 13:27.932
Well, guess what?

13:25.388 --> 13:27.932
I get to keep the cash now.

13:27.974 --> 13:31.018
So take that, Derek,

13:27.974 --> 13:31.018
and, you know, put it.

Not gonna lie,

13:42.447 --> 13:44.783
the whole dad reveal

13:42.447 --> 13:44.783
did not help my case.

13:44.823 --> 13:46.993
All right, I'm gonna

use her burner phone

13:44.823 --> 13:46.993
to call the Nine-Nine.

Do you like it, Jake?

13:50.079 --> 13:51.872
Uh, yes! I love it.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.667
Real Cruella de Vil vibes.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.460
No, no, no.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.460
I'm not Cruella de Vil.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.128
I would never hurt dogs.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.588
-I'm Perdita!

-Who?

The romantic lead

13:58.630 --> 14:01.466
of the film?

14:01.508 --> 14:03.134
Pongo's wife?

14:03.176 --> 14:05.094
-The girl dog.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.094
-Yes, yes!

14:05.136 --> 14:07.305
[laughs] Of course,

14:05.136 --> 14:07.305
you look exactly like Perdita.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.808
Oh, my God.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.808
Thank you so much.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.025
-Hey, Debbie?

14:17.732 --> 14:19.025
-Hmm?

14:19.066 --> 14:20.527
Will you hand me your phone

14:19.066 --> 14:20.527
so I can

14:20.568 --> 14:21.944
take your picture

14:20.568 --> 14:21.944
and you can Gram this?

14:21.986 --> 14:23.863
-[gasps]

14:21.986 --> 14:23.863
-I mean, the house, this coat,

14:23.904 --> 14:25.782
you're gonna wanna

14:23.904 --> 14:25.782
show this off to people, right?

14:25.824 --> 14:27.325
That is such a good idea!

14:27.367 --> 14:29.369
I<i> do</i> wanna show off to people!

14:29.410 --> 14:30.620
I just have to

14:29.410 --> 14:30.620
make a quick call.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.622
Hi, Mom.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.622
Do you like my mansion?

14:32.664 --> 14:34.791
Deborah Lynn,

14:32.664 --> 14:34.791
why are you holding a gun?

14:34.833 --> 14:36.626
Oh, my God, Mom!

14:36.668 --> 14:38.878
I'm wearing a fur coat,

14:36.668 --> 14:38.878
and<i> that's</i> what you focus on?

14:38.919 --> 14:40.839
I hate you so freaking much!

14:40.880 --> 14:42.423
[Charles] This is ridiculous.

14:42.465 --> 14:44.592
Neither of you have even

14:42.465 --> 14:44.592
taken a bathroom break.

14:44.634 --> 14:47.637
Are you kidding me?

14:44.634 --> 14:47.637
Do you think

14:44.634 --> 14:47.637
world record-holder Howard Berg

14:47.679 --> 14:50.348
would stop in the middle

14:47.679 --> 14:50.348
of a read-off to expel?

14:50.390 --> 14:52.475
-[inhales sharply] Ow.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.475
-What's going on, Santiago?

14:52.517 --> 14:56.229
It's nothing.

14:52.517 --> 14:56.229
It's my guide finger.

14:52.517 --> 14:56.229
I've got paper burn.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.314
-Let me see.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.314
-Hmph.

14:58.356 --> 15:00.817
Santiago, you're hurt.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.193
Don't be a hero.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.903
[sighs]

15:05.363 --> 15:06.865
Damn.

15:05.363 --> 15:06.865
You must've been cooking.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.783
-I was.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.783
-Let's take a break,

15:08.825 --> 15:10.284
-put some ointment on that.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.284
-Right. And when I come back,

15:10.326 --> 15:12.537
my finger's slipping

15:10.326 --> 15:12.537
all over the page?

15:12.579 --> 15:15.707
Nice try. I'm not falling

15:12.579 --> 15:15.707
for any of your tricks.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.291
Oh, but you already have.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.711
While you were waggling

15:17.333 --> 15:19.711
your finger in the air,

15:19.753 --> 15:21.128
I've been reading all this time

15:21.170 --> 15:23.089
-out of the corner of my eye.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.089
-Damn it!

15:23.130 --> 15:24.758
Why are you doing this,

15:23.130 --> 15:24.758
Deborah Lynn?

15:24.799 --> 15:27.009
[Debbie]

15:24.799 --> 15:27.009
Because you're being

15:24.799 --> 15:27.009
so mean, Mom.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.553
Also, I know that

15:27.051 --> 15:28.553
if I didn't tie you up,

15:28.595 --> 15:30.388
you'd probably go

15:28.595 --> 15:30.388
run and find your phone

15:30.430 --> 15:32.515
-so you could call Derek.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.515
-Maybe we<i> should</i> call Derek.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.934
-He could help. He's a lawyer.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.934
-Yeah, I know he's a lawyer.

15:34.975 --> 15:37.311
Do you think you could go

15:34.975 --> 15:37.311
more than five minutes

15:34.975 --> 15:37.311
without bringing that up?

15:37.353 --> 15:39.689
You have to get

15:37.353 --> 15:39.689
the gun from her.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.357
I know, but how

15:39.731 --> 15:41.357
do I get close enough?

15:41.399 --> 15:43.276
There's one way. She clearly

15:41.399 --> 15:43.276
has a thing for you.

15:43.317 --> 15:44.694
Why do you say that?

15:43.317 --> 15:44.694
Just because

15:44.736 --> 15:46.237
she has a fantasy of us

15:44.736 --> 15:46.237
as a dog couple?

15:46.279 --> 15:48.155
Wait. Yeah, I see it.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.155
That's gonna work.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.909
[Debbie]

15:48.197 --> 15:50.909
...very tacky. And it's like,

15:48.197 --> 15:50.909
you don't even care

15:50.950 --> 15:52.159
how many chimneys I have!

15:52.201 --> 15:53.620
Hey, sorry

15:52.201 --> 15:53.620
to interrupt.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.413
Mrs. Fogle,

15:53.661 --> 15:55.413
we weren't introduced.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.331
I'm Jake, Debbie's boyfriend.

15:57.373 --> 16:00.543
-You are? We are?

15:57.373 --> 16:00.543
-I mean, yeah,

16:00.585 --> 16:03.003
-if you're into it.

16:00.585 --> 16:03.003
-I am. I do.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.506
See, Mom?

16:03.045 --> 16:05.506
I<i> am</i> with someone.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.341
All those psychics were wrong.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.594
-So listen, babe...

16:07.383 --> 16:09.594
-Yes, babe?

16:09.636 --> 16:11.220
-I was thinking...

16:09.636 --> 16:11.220
-About what, babe?

16:11.262 --> 16:12.847
-...that we--

16:11.262 --> 16:12.847
-Go on, babe.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.265
Wow, you really latched onto

16:12.889 --> 16:14.265
the babe thing.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.725
-I love it.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.725
-Great, great, great.

16:15.767 --> 16:17.184
Well, anyways,

16:15.767 --> 16:17.184
I was just gonna say,

16:17.226 --> 16:18.645
once we're done

16:17.226 --> 16:18.645
with this big score,

16:18.686 --> 16:20.271
we're gonna need

16:18.686 --> 16:20.271
a place to hide out,

16:20.313 --> 16:21.898
somewhere where the cops

16:20.313 --> 16:21.898
could never find us.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.734
-Ooh, like Epcot.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.734
-Uhh, yes, Epcot is great.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.193
That's exactly

16:24.776 --> 16:26.193
what I was thinking.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.613
We can kiss in front

16:26.235 --> 16:28.613
of the Eiffel Tower,

16:28.655 --> 16:30.156
on the canals of Venice,

16:30.197 --> 16:31.866
oh, in the Canada Pavilion!

16:31.908 --> 16:34.410
Yes! But why wait

16:31.908 --> 16:34.410
till the Canada Pavilion

16:34.452 --> 16:35.703
when we can start right now?

16:35.745 --> 16:37.079
-Huh?

16:35.745 --> 16:37.079
-Oh, my God.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.457
-This is happening.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.457
-Come here.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.875
-Eh--

16:39.499 --> 16:40.875
-[struggling efforts]

16:40.917 --> 16:42.669
-[grunts]

16:40.917 --> 16:42.669
-Hi-yah!

16:42.710 --> 16:44.671
What the hell, babe?

16:46.380 --> 16:48.424
Debbie, what's your plan here?

16:48.466 --> 16:49.717
-Talk to me.

16:48.466 --> 16:49.717
-Why? So you can

16:49.759 --> 16:51.469
just tell me

16:49.759 --> 16:51.469
more beautiful lies?

16:51.511 --> 16:53.095
You think you can

16:51.511 --> 16:53.095
just lick your lips

16:53.137 --> 16:56.056
-and make me

16:53.137 --> 16:56.056
weak in the knees?

16:53.137 --> 16:56.056
-No.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.686
Nice try,

16:58.142 --> 16:59.686
but I closed my eyes

16:59.727 --> 17:00.812
so I didn't even see it.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.229
-[phone beeping]

17:00.854 --> 17:02.229
-Oh, come on.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.357
Oh. Nucci's on his way.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.357
[laughs]

17:04.398 --> 17:06.860
-And I'm about to be rich.

17:04.398 --> 17:06.860
-Debbie, this is bad.

17:06.901 --> 17:08.528
You don't wanna be

17:06.901 --> 17:08.528
an accessory to murder.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.488
W-what are you talking about?

17:10.530 --> 17:11.865
What do you think

17:10.530 --> 17:11.865
is gonna happen

17:11.906 --> 17:13.032
when Nucci gets here

17:11.906 --> 17:13.032
and finds two cops?

17:13.073 --> 17:14.826
He's gonna kill us.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.410
Yeah, I know that.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.788
Um, I've obviously thought

17:16.452 --> 17:18.788
all this through,

17:18.830 --> 17:22.333
and it all is going

17:18.830 --> 17:22.333
according to my plans.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.835
-[gunfire]

17:22.375 --> 17:23.835
-[debris clattering]

17:23.877 --> 17:25.044
I'm sorry,

17:23.877 --> 17:25.044
I just started trembling

17:25.085 --> 17:26.671
and I accidentally--

17:26.713 --> 17:29.173
Debbie, please,

17:26.713 --> 17:29.173
just put the gun down!

17:29.215 --> 17:32.176
I just talked to the manager

17:29.215 --> 17:32.176
at the hotel where

17:29.215 --> 17:32.176
the handoff was happening.

17:32.218 --> 17:35.346
He said Debbie's room

17:32.218 --> 17:35.346
was empty, and there's no sign

17:32.218 --> 17:35.346
of Rosa or Jake.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.682
Is there anything in

17:35.388 --> 17:37.682
those diaries that could

17:35.388 --> 17:37.682
help us find 'em?

17:37.724 --> 17:39.475
Debbie mentions her mom a bunch

17:37.724 --> 17:39.475
in one of the ones I read.

17:39.517 --> 17:40.768
Seems like

17:39.517 --> 17:40.768
she tells her everything.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.061
Ooh, that's a good lead.

17:42.102 --> 17:43.813
It<i> is</i> a good lead, isn't it?

17:43.855 --> 17:45.439
Did you hear that,

17:43.855 --> 17:45.439
speed freaks?

17:45.481 --> 17:47.525
Let's find out all we can

17:45.481 --> 17:47.525
about the mom.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.277
I'll start reading right away,

17:47.567 --> 17:50.277
because slow and steady wins--

17:50.319 --> 17:52.530
-Her mother's name

17:50.319 --> 17:52.530
is Margaret Jean Fogle.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.530
-She lives in Bensonhurst.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.615
-She drives a maroon Lexus.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.615
-Vanity plates, "DEREKSMOM."

17:54.657 --> 17:56.325
-She's been married

17:54.657 --> 17:56.325
three times.

17:54.657 --> 17:56.325
-To Horace Mills.

17:56.367 --> 17:58.536
-Then Frank Yelter.

17:56.367 --> 17:58.536
-And then James Fogle.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.830
-She goes grocery shopping

17:58.578 --> 18:00.830
on Tuesdays.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.830
-Water aerobics on Wednesdays.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.498
-Book club on Fridays.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.498
-She drinks too much wine.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.166
-Always a pinot grigio.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.166
-Always from Napa.

18:04.208 --> 18:07.628
The race.

18:04.208 --> 18:07.628
Slow and steady

18:04.208 --> 18:07.628
wins the race.

18:07.670 --> 18:10.172
OK, uh, what if I just

18:07.670 --> 18:10.172
tell Nucci not to kill you?

18:10.214 --> 18:11.841
You know,

18:10.214 --> 18:11.841
we're business partners,

18:11.883 --> 18:13.593
we make all of our

18:11.883 --> 18:13.593
business decisions together.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.469
Yep, we're all

18:13.634 --> 18:15.469
gonna die today.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.638
Debbie, if you just untie us,

18:15.511 --> 18:17.638
we can help you get out of

18:15.511 --> 18:17.638
here.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.140
OK, but if I untie you,

18:17.680 --> 18:20.140
you'll arrest me,

18:17.680 --> 18:20.140
and then I'll go to prison

18:20.182 --> 18:21.684
-for the rest of my life.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.684
-[Rosa] You'll be

18:20.182 --> 18:21.684
in prison anyway.

18:21.726 --> 18:23.519
I guarantee you

18:21.726 --> 18:23.519
if anything happens to us,

18:23.561 --> 18:25.063
the Nine-Nine

18:23.561 --> 18:25.063
will hunt you down.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.230
OK, OK, OK, OK.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.148
Maybe I<i> should</i> surrender.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.901
[whines] But I don't wanna

18:28.190 --> 18:29.901
go to jail!

18:29.943 --> 18:31.485
OK, I don't know what to do.

18:31.527 --> 18:32.987
Um, Mom, help me.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.488
Now you need my help?

18:34.530 --> 18:36.032
Please, it doesn't matter

18:34.530 --> 18:36.032
what I say.

18:36.074 --> 18:37.450
You're still gonna mess it up.

18:37.491 --> 18:38.868
Just like you messed up

18:37.491 --> 18:38.868
your bangs

18:38.910 --> 18:40.411
when you had to cut

18:38.910 --> 18:40.411
your own hair.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.704
Well, I'm sure that

18:40.453 --> 18:41.704
was a long time ago.

18:41.746 --> 18:43.205
-That was last year.

18:41.746 --> 18:43.205
-I see.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.749
Or when you got

18:43.247 --> 18:44.749
in a car accident

18:44.791 --> 18:46.208
when your brother

18:44.791 --> 18:46.208
was going to take the bar.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.210
Or when you lost all your money

18:48.252 --> 18:50.421
investing in that cruise line

18:48.252 --> 18:50.421
for cats.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.006
-Feline Cruise Line.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.006
-[Margaret] You know what?

18:52.048 --> 18:53.466
You're not my daughter

18:52.048 --> 18:53.466
anymore.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.635
What?

18:53.507 --> 18:55.635
What are you saying?

18:55.676 --> 18:59.013
You have embarrassed me

18:55.676 --> 18:59.013
and the family

18:55.676 --> 18:59.013
for the last time.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.099
I'm done with you. Goodbye.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.810
Shut<i> up, </i> Margaret!

19:03.851 --> 19:05.519
It's the same crap

19:03.851 --> 19:05.519
my parents pulled.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.814
Always pointing out my flaws,

19:05.561 --> 19:07.814
never helping,

19:07.855 --> 19:09.649
and then bailing

19:07.855 --> 19:09.649
when things got messy.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.818
-You know,

19:09.690 --> 19:11.818
I was a lot like you.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.818
-You were holed up

19:11.859 --> 19:13.945
with a ton of cocaine

19:11.859 --> 19:13.945
and a bunch of guns?

19:13.987 --> 19:15.362
-That's my business.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.362
-What?

19:15.404 --> 19:16.864
I spent years telling myself

19:16.906 --> 19:18.449
that their tough love

19:16.906 --> 19:18.449
made me stronger,

19:18.491 --> 19:19.826
but you know what I really wish

19:18.491 --> 19:19.826
they'd done?

19:19.867 --> 19:21.744
-What?

19:19.867 --> 19:21.744
-Been nice to me.

19:21.786 --> 19:24.038
I wish they would've told me

19:21.786 --> 19:24.038
I'd made a mistake,

19:24.080 --> 19:26.958
but that they still loved me

19:24.080 --> 19:26.958
and they would help me

19:24.080 --> 19:26.958
try to figure it out.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.168
Would've saved me

19:27.000 --> 19:29.168
a lot of pain.

19:29.209 --> 19:32.546
Debbie, you have made

19:29.209 --> 19:32.546
some really bad choices today.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.674
-Really bad.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.674
-Not now, Debbie's mom.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.968
You are not a bad person.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.886
If we get out of this alive,

19:37.010 --> 19:38.886
I promise you

19:38.928 --> 19:40.721
I will help you however I can.

19:40.763 --> 19:43.724
Wow. Thank you.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.936
[unlocking handcuffs]

19:50.106 --> 19:51.565
Oh, your back is very wet.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.275
Yeah, I guess between

19:51.607 --> 19:53.275
the fur coat

19:53.317 --> 19:55.153
and all the cocaine,

19:53.317 --> 19:55.153
I've been sweating a lot.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.864
-[tires screech, door shuts]

19:55.194 --> 19:57.864
-That's Nucci. He's here.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.284
Hi, Debbie.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.284
Do you have something for me?

20:02.326 --> 20:04.578
Yes, I do.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.578
I do have something.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.751
-I have two friends.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.751
-What the hell is this?

20:10.793 --> 20:12.170
-Drop your weapons.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.170
-[Nucci] No way.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.588
You drop your weapons.

20:16.132 --> 20:17.842
[sirens wailing]

20:17.884 --> 20:19.886
[Amy] NYPD!

20:17.884 --> 20:19.886
Everyone down on the ground!

20:19.927 --> 20:21.971
Down on the ground,

20:19.927 --> 20:21.971
right now!

20:22.013 --> 20:24.057
[male cop]

20:22.013 --> 20:24.057
Put 'em down!

20:24.098 --> 20:25.933
[Holt]

20:24.098 --> 20:25.933
Don't do anything stupid.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.561
-I will shoot her.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.561
Put down your gun.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.561
-Oh, man,

20:28.602 --> 20:30.021
grabbing Debbie

20:28.602 --> 20:30.021
was a big mistake.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.480
-What do you mean by--

20:30.063 --> 20:31.480
-[grunts]

20:31.522 --> 20:33.816
-Hi-yah!

20:31.522 --> 20:33.816
-Unhh! Oof!

20:33.858 --> 20:35.943
Whoa! Debbie,

20:33.858 --> 20:35.943
that was amazing.

20:35.985 --> 20:38.029
Thanks. By the way,

20:35.985 --> 20:38.029
Jake thinks

20:38.071 --> 20:40.280
-you smell like [bleep].

20:38.071 --> 20:40.280
-[Jake] What? That's weird.

20:40.322 --> 20:44.744
I don't know why she said that.

20:40.322 --> 20:44.744
Anyways, let's get Debbie

20:40.322 --> 20:44.744
into a cop car!

20:44.785 --> 20:47.287
So... you really

20:44.785 --> 20:47.287
gonna help out Debbie,

20:47.329 --> 20:49.289
or did you just say all

20:47.329 --> 20:49.289
that stuff so she'd let us go?

20:49.331 --> 20:51.250
I told the DA she cooperated

20:49.331 --> 20:51.250
and he agreed to be lenient,

20:51.291 --> 20:53.586
especially since we got Nucci

20:51.291 --> 20:53.586
and the cocaine was returned.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.046
Except for the pound of it

20:53.627 --> 20:55.046
that Debbie did.

20:55.088 --> 20:56.630
Yeah. The paramedic

20:55.088 --> 20:56.630
said he had never heard

20:56.672 --> 20:57.965
a human heart beat that loudly.

20:58.007 --> 20:59.383
He could hear it

20:58.007 --> 20:59.383
outside of her body.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.135
Ugh. She'll probably

20:59.425 --> 21:01.135
get ten years.

21:01.177 --> 21:02.970
But it's better than 30.

21:01.177 --> 21:02.970
And let's be real,

21:03.012 --> 21:04.931
Debbie's life wasn't gonna

21:03.012 --> 21:04.931
begin until she was 50 anyway.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.182
Yeah, the kooky aunt vibe

21:06.224 --> 21:07.558
will probably

21:06.224 --> 21:07.558
play a lot better then.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.769
So hey, one more thing.

21:12.312 --> 21:15.233
We can never let anyone know

21:12.312 --> 21:15.233
that we got beat up

21:12.312 --> 21:15.233
by Debbie Fogle.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.235
-Agreed. To the grave.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.235
-Take it to the grave?

21:17.276 --> 21:18.652
-This conversation

21:17.276 --> 21:18.652
never happened.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.652
-I don't even know who you are.

21:18.694 --> 21:20.154
That's hurtful.

21:18.694 --> 21:20.154
You took it too far.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.906
That's a weird thing

21:20.196 --> 21:21.906
for a stranger to say.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.116
Bye.

21:23.157 --> 21:24.158
I-- [clucks]

21:24.200 --> 21:26.285
-Not a doctor.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.285
-Shh.

21:26.326 --> 21:27.954
Fremulon.
