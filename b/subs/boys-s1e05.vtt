WEBVTT

00:19.186 --> 00:21.188
("A Lo Caliche"
by Sr Ortegón playing)

00:28.529 --> 00:31.157
Hey, baby.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.616
-Oh, Jesus Christ.
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.785
Where have you been?
It's been days.

00:34.827 --> 00:36.662
Yeah. I've been
handling business.

00:36.704 --> 00:37.997
It's okay now, it's okay.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.666
You said I had to hide, you said
we were in trouble and...

00:40.708 --> 00:43.169
You know, I think, I think
I got it worked out.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.213
I think I have
some-some good news.

00:48.340 --> 00:49.717
Good news?

00:49.717 --> 00:53.053
Stillwell. She's open
to us going public.

00:53.095 --> 00:55.514
Don't you lie to me.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.349
Hand on a Bible.

00:59.643 --> 01:02.938
Yeah. But, listen,

01:02.980 --> 01:06.567
for us to go public,
you have to come clean with me.

01:06.609 --> 01:09.236
Like, I have to know
who you told about Compound V.

01:15.034 --> 01:16.285
Hey, come on.

01:18.329 --> 01:21.916
This is, this is you and me.

01:21.957 --> 01:25.586
I mean, we're Bonnie and Clyde.

01:25.628 --> 01:28.422
Ride or die, right?

01:31.008 --> 01:33.886
I...

01:33.928 --> 01:35.763
Oh, shit.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.686
I told these guys,

01:42.728 --> 01:46.315
you were running the V
down near the Noodle Palace.

01:46.357 --> 01:49.693
I'm so sorry, baby.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.028
I had to. I...

01:51.070 --> 01:52.571
Why?

01:54.573 --> 01:56.158
What do they have on you?

01:56.200 --> 01:58.786
I don't know their names,

01:58.828 --> 02:01.247
but there was this British guy,

02:01.288 --> 02:04.083
dark hair, real smug asshole.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.502
Buzz cut French guy,
big black guy with a goatee,

02:06.544 --> 02:07.920
and a skinny white kid.

02:07.962 --> 02:11.507
I think they were all
working together. Mm-hmm.

02:14.927 --> 02:17.388
-I'm so sorry, baby.
-Nah.

02:17.429 --> 02:18.722
-I'm so sorry.
-No, it's okay.

02:18.764 --> 02:20.432
-I fucked up so bad.
-It's all right.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.936
You know what I was
thinking about

02:23.978 --> 02:25.145
on my run over here?

02:27.147 --> 02:29.191
Our first date.

02:32.444 --> 02:33.821
Most first dates

02:33.863 --> 02:36.824
order, like, a scallop

02:36.866 --> 02:38.868
and a bottle of water.

02:40.953 --> 02:42.788
But you...

02:45.040 --> 02:47.835
(chuckles)
...got a dark beer,

02:47.877 --> 02:49.503
a New York strip,

02:49.545 --> 02:53.757
-and chocolate chip cheesecake.
-(laughs)

02:53.799 --> 02:55.593
I remember thinking,

02:55.634 --> 02:57.720
"Here's someone

02:57.761 --> 03:00.222
who isn't afraid to be happy."

03:03.475 --> 03:06.228
And I fell for you,
right then and there.

03:09.773 --> 03:11.650
I love you.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.654
I love you, too.

03:30.419 --> 03:32.338
Why?

03:32.379 --> 03:34.673
(gasping)

03:53.901 --> 03:55.361
Well?

03:55.402 --> 03:58.614
Heroin overdose.

03:58.656 --> 04:00.950
(Homelander sighs)

04:00.991 --> 04:03.577
I'm sorry to hear that.

04:03.619 --> 04:04.787
And the V?

04:04.828 --> 04:06.789
-She told some guys about it.
-No, no.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.832
I mean you.

04:10.292 --> 04:13.671
(scoffs) Come on, A-Train.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.673
You've been shooting it up
for weeks.

04:15.714 --> 04:17.466
You really think
I wouldn't notice?

04:17.508 --> 04:20.636
I'm done, man.

04:20.678 --> 04:22.429
Nah, I'm fucking,
I'm fucking done.

04:22.471 --> 04:24.264
-Cold turkey.
-Really?

04:24.306 --> 04:25.683
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

04:25.724 --> 04:28.060
Good.

04:28.102 --> 04:31.063
Yeah.

04:31.105 --> 04:33.440
You know,

04:33.482 --> 04:35.943
you really screwed up, kiddo.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.114
But you did the right thing
coming to me,

04:40.155 --> 04:41.448
and I'm proud of you.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.659
Thanks, Homelander,

04:43.701 --> 04:46.412
for giving me the chance.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.288
I appreciate it.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.335
Hey. Come on.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.132
I love you.

04:58.173 --> 04:59.508
We're family.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.262
I'll always be
watching over you.

05:05.347 --> 05:06.890
Always.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.728
Attaboy.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.604
Oh, and the misplaced
Asian girl?

05:12.646 --> 05:13.856
I'll find her.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.402
(quietly):
Fuck.

05:27.703 --> 05:29.705
(humming)

05:30.998 --> 05:32.666
Le poulet.

05:32.708 --> 05:35.210
Massage the bird
with olive oil,

05:35.252 --> 05:37.337
then a sprinkle
of salt and pepper,

05:37.379 --> 05:39.298
then I bake. (sniffs)

05:39.339 --> 05:43.052
Basting every 20 minutes
to keep it from drying out

05:43.093 --> 05:45.387
is very important.

05:47.431 --> 05:50.684
Till it's crisp,
but not too crunchy.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.982
And voilà.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.741
I think you understand me.

06:05.783 --> 06:07.159
It's in your eyes.

06:09.161 --> 06:10.788
Can you speak?

06:13.582 --> 06:15.667
Tell me what you know,
mon coeur.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.879
So we can find these fuckers

06:18.921 --> 06:21.673
who did this to you,

06:21.715 --> 06:23.801
so I can get you back home.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.590
-Oh, my God.
-(laughs)

07:03.632 --> 07:05.425
The other one had kind of
like a, you know,

07:05.467 --> 07:07.261
a Nikki Minaj thing going on.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.054
Oh, yeah, the other one sucks.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.764
They're only letting me
wear this one

07:10.806 --> 07:13.600
because, apparently,
it's family friendly.

07:13.642 --> 07:15.727
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.604
You know,
I'm surprised you came.

07:17.646 --> 07:20.524
I seem to remember
you inviting me?

07:20.566 --> 07:22.442
No, I mean,
I'm-I'm glad you came.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.486
You just... I don't know,

07:24.528 --> 07:28.365
you don't really strike me
as the religious type.

07:28.407 --> 07:31.952
Well, yeah, lapsed, but I served
my time in Sunday school.

07:31.994 --> 07:34.204
-Hmm.
-MAN: Hey, Starlight.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.372
Hi.

07:35.414 --> 07:37.958
Okay, so, do you know
everybody here,

07:38.000 --> 07:39.626
or just, like, 99.9%?

07:39.668 --> 07:41.712
No. My mom and I, um,

07:41.753 --> 07:45.424
we would drive coast to coast
in her brown Honda Civic,

07:45.465 --> 07:47.342
just doing the whole
Christian Circuit thing.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.387
You know, Power Fest,
Capes for Christ,

07:50.429 --> 07:51.513
Believe Expo.

07:51.555 --> 07:52.806
(chuckles)

07:52.848 --> 07:54.224
(sighs) We wore

07:54.266 --> 07:57.060
the tires off of that car.
These people are like

07:57.102 --> 07:58.687
family to me.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.065
After everything
that's happened,

08:02.107 --> 08:04.359
it's actually...

08:04.401 --> 08:06.445
it's really nice
to see them again.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.699
-Sweetheart.
-(gasps) Mom! Hi.

08:10.741 --> 08:11.825
Mm.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.243
-How was your flight?
-Oh, it was a nightmare.

08:13.285 --> 08:15.746
I think we sat on the runway
for 45 minutes,

08:15.787 --> 08:18.165
and then there was all the,
you know, Flight 37 stuff.

08:18.207 --> 08:21.585
But a Xanax and a couple
of Pinot Grigio later,

08:21.627 --> 08:23.670
-here I am.
-(chuckles)

08:23.712 --> 08:26.089
Oh, hello. Uh, do you want
a autograph?

08:26.131 --> 08:27.716
H-Honey, give him an autograph.

08:27.758 --> 08:30.010
Oh, no, no. We--
I mean, I know her.

08:30.052 --> 08:31.511
-I mean, I don't...
-Yeah.

08:31.553 --> 08:32.888
-We know each other. Yes.
-Mm-hmm.

08:32.930 --> 08:34.348
-Yeah.
-Oh. Do you work at Vought?

08:34.389 --> 08:35.557
No. No, no, no.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.309
Mom, this is, this is Hughie.

08:37.351 --> 08:40.938
He's... uh, he's a friend.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.608
-Hi.
-Uh, how nice.

08:44.650 --> 08:46.902
Starlight. You hydrating?

08:46.944 --> 08:48.904
Hey, Donna.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.948
-How was your flight?
-Oh, it-it was perfect
in every w...

08:50.989 --> 08:53.992
You have that "Teen Roundtable"
in about 15, are you ready?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.327
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh, she was born ready.

08:55.369 --> 08:56.620
I should know, I was there.

08:56.662 --> 08:57.996
Great. (laughs)

08:58.038 --> 09:00.874
Um, do you want to come?

09:00.916 --> 09:03.210
Uh... You know what?
I'll let you go ahead.

09:03.252 --> 09:05.379
Go, uh, go roundtable
those teens.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.588
-Mm.
-We'll catch up later?

09:06.630 --> 09:08.632
Yeah, sure.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.431
EZEKIEL:
So, Jesus...

09:16.473 --> 09:18.767
Jesus said, "Hey, bro.

09:18.809 --> 09:21.144
"Hey, bro, bring it in.

09:21.186 --> 09:23.939
"You shouldn't need proof.

09:23.981 --> 09:26.316
"You should just

09:26.358 --> 09:28.652
"believe because I say so,

09:28.694 --> 09:30.737
"because you have

09:30.779 --> 09:32.823
-faith."
-(cheering, applause)

09:32.864 --> 09:35.367
"People who have faith,

09:35.409 --> 09:38.120
those are my peeps, y'all."
That's what Jesus said.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.165
But I am gonna ask you
one question...

09:42.207 --> 09:44.126
Two twats at every entrance,

09:44.167 --> 09:47.129
armed to holy hell. In church.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.547
Well, that's America for you,

09:48.588 --> 09:49.840
isn't it?

09:49.881 --> 09:51.883
And God's watching
from up above.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.677
Right there.

09:53.719 --> 09:55.387
Over there.

09:55.429 --> 09:56.555
BUTCHER:
Yeah.

09:56.596 --> 10:00.100
Security's tighter
than a choir boy's asshole.

10:00.142 --> 10:02.102
So let me ask you something:

10:02.144 --> 10:05.188
Why could Jesus walk on water?

10:05.230 --> 10:07.899
Why does Homelander fly?

10:07.941 --> 10:09.526
(cheering, applause)

10:09.568 --> 10:13.238
How about A-Train, why does he
get to run the way he runs?

10:16.867 --> 10:18.869
(crowd gasping)

10:21.079 --> 10:23.373
Or how do I get to hold
the whole world

10:23.415 --> 10:26.293
in my loving embrace?

10:26.335 --> 10:29.463
Why were we chosen?

10:29.504 --> 10:32.424
Because of the Lord.

10:32.466 --> 10:36.345
Because we were born
with his power.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.805
Because we believe!

10:38.847 --> 10:40.098
(cheering)

10:42.184 --> 10:44.353
-We believe.
-$15,000

10:44.394 --> 10:46.897
for an exclusive
VIP experience with Ezekiel.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.106
Seriously?

10:48.148 --> 10:50.817
There's not an easier,
cheaper way

10:50.859 --> 10:53.403
for us to get to him?

10:53.445 --> 10:56.782
We ain't getting to Ezekiel.
You are.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.825
-I am?
-Whoa, whoa, wait. What?

10:58.867 --> 11:00.786
-Well, Starlight's one
of the headliners, right?
-Wait.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.287
-She'll get you in.
-Whoa.

11:02.329 --> 11:05.457
Look, we've only been on, like,
a date and a half, okay?

11:05.499 --> 11:07.542
I can't just ask her
for a Diamond Club Pass.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.920
What's the matter? You worried

11:09.961 --> 11:11.963
your fake Supe girlfriend's
gonna think you're using her?

11:12.005 --> 11:14.007
Okay, then what?

11:14.049 --> 11:16.510
I just go up to Ezekiel,
"Hey, man. What's up with you

11:16.551 --> 11:18.345
smuggling blue dope
into Chinatown basements?"

11:18.387 --> 11:20.680
Yeah, pretty much.
Once you show him this.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.267
Jesus.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.188
This is from that club
you took me to?

11:28.230 --> 11:30.232
You remembered our first
night together. I'm touched.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.734
Okay, why is this the first time
I'm hearing about this plan?

11:32.776 --> 11:34.653
This kid needs
to be trained up, Butcher.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.155
Yeah. Yeah, what he said.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.032
I-I don't know how
to blackmail anybody.

11:39.074 --> 11:41.868
Hughie, you've done a murder.

11:41.910 --> 11:44.538
Comparatively speaking,
this will be a piece of cake.

11:48.959 --> 11:52.295
I know. I know.

11:52.337 --> 11:53.713
HOMELANDER:
We're here today

11:53.755 --> 11:55.465
to remember the victims

11:55.507 --> 11:57.759
of Trans-Oceanic Flight 37.

11:57.801 --> 12:01.680
123 brave souls lost
in an instant,

12:01.721 --> 12:04.224
in a senseless act of violence.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.479
Carolyn Kozinsky,

12:09.521 --> 12:12.566
a preschool teacher from Skokie.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.734
Dr. Julien Barro,

12:14.776 --> 12:17.529
an esteemed French neurosurgeon.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.700
(muffled screaming)

12:23.201 --> 12:25.579
Susan Lopez from Evanston

12:25.620 --> 12:27.998
and her daughter Maya.

12:32.502 --> 12:36.298
Samuel Brown,
a teacher of physics

12:36.339 --> 12:38.508
from Los Angeles.

12:38.550 --> 12:41.595
(cameras clicking)

12:41.636 --> 12:44.681
We are all truly sorry
for your loss.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.937
Where'd you go?

12:50.979 --> 12:53.523
The only thing I hate more
than blubbering people

12:53.565 --> 12:56.485
-are boring speeches.
-Right.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.570
You remember that nutjob

12:58.612 --> 13:01.323
in Albany last year?

13:01.364 --> 13:05.118
Killed his wife,
and he-he came out of the house

13:05.160 --> 13:07.704
with a gun at his
daughter's head.

13:07.746 --> 13:09.122
Remember that?

13:09.164 --> 13:12.751
Cops pissing their pants,
didn't know what to do.

13:12.792 --> 13:16.379
And then you, you...

13:16.421 --> 13:18.757
you step up, very calmly,

13:18.798 --> 13:21.676
ask for the sergeant's Bic pen
and fling it

13:21.718 --> 13:25.472
26 yards,

13:25.514 --> 13:28.183
right into
the asshole's eyeball.

13:28.225 --> 13:29.601
(clears throat)

13:29.643 --> 13:32.312
-Dead shot, dead shooter.
-What's your point?

13:32.354 --> 13:34.940
My point is that
you took action.

13:36.942 --> 13:38.818
That's what I love
about you, Maeve.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.741
Look, Maeve, nobody wanted

13:44.783 --> 13:48.203
that airplane to go down
the way it did, of course not.

13:48.245 --> 13:51.790
And now...

13:51.831 --> 13:54.251
we got to make the best of it.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.127
Otherwise...

13:59.089 --> 14:01.591
Well, otherwise,
it was all for nothing.

14:05.303 --> 14:08.557
What did I tell you
about boring speeches?

14:15.981 --> 14:19.609
Mom, when did that happen?

14:19.651 --> 14:21.653
What are you talking about?
That's always been there.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.414
PASTOR JOHN:
I know what
you're all thinking,

14:32.455 --> 14:36.126
"Holy mackerel, Starlight?
From The Seven? Here with us?"

14:36.167 --> 14:38.295
Well, I knew her
when she was still

14:38.336 --> 14:39.838
in pigtails and braces

14:39.879 --> 14:41.673
and she'd sit right
where you're sitting.

14:41.715 --> 14:42.882
-(laughs)
-So don't be shy.

14:42.924 --> 14:44.134
You ask what's on your mind.

14:44.175 --> 14:45.885
Starlight is here for you.

14:47.262 --> 14:49.055
Yeah?

14:49.097 --> 14:52.225
I have this friend
from my soccer team, Sunji,

14:52.267 --> 14:53.810
she's Hindu.

14:53.852 --> 14:57.564
I know it's kind of
my responsibility, I guess,

14:57.606 --> 14:58.982
to get her to accept Jesus,

14:59.024 --> 15:02.319
but it feels weird to me.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.487
Well, Jesus also says

15:04.529 --> 15:06.948
to love your neighbor.

15:06.990 --> 15:08.950
But if you love your neighbor,

15:08.992 --> 15:10.869
don't you want to save them
from damnation?

15:10.910 --> 15:13.204
You have to look at it
as good news.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.415
You have a chance
to help your friend

15:15.457 --> 15:18.293
find eternal life, right?

15:19.628 --> 15:20.587
Oh, yes.

15:20.629 --> 15:22.922
Have you ever had a boyfriend?

15:22.964 --> 15:24.007
Well, yeah.

15:24.049 --> 15:25.759
Yeah, I was with Drummer Boy
for a while,

15:25.800 --> 15:26.843
for almost a year.

15:28.345 --> 15:29.596
Yeah?

15:29.638 --> 15:32.807
Um... (clears throat)

15:32.849 --> 15:35.727
Did you have...

15:35.769 --> 15:37.687
-sex with him?
-(giggling)

15:39.898 --> 15:42.525
Well, I...

15:44.611 --> 15:46.738
...you know, I think,
I think everyone hopes

15:46.780 --> 15:49.157
that their first is the one.

15:49.199 --> 15:52.118
And... it's private, but...

15:57.374 --> 15:58.958
I'm a virgin.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.419
Yeah, I'm...

16:01.461 --> 16:06.257
saving myself for my
future husband.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.802
See? Hebrews 13:4.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.762
"Let the bed be undefiled,

16:10.804 --> 16:13.306
for God will judge
the sexually immoral."

16:13.348 --> 16:15.100
Okay.

16:15.141 --> 16:18.645
I think we have time
for a few more.

16:18.687 --> 16:20.605
I'm-I'm not really sure what
you're saying, son.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.857
I'm saying if there is some
geezer up there

16:22.899 --> 16:24.067
with a big white beard,

16:24.109 --> 16:25.860
he's a world heavyweight cunt.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.946
-What?
-I-I'm sorry, did you

16:27.987 --> 16:30.240
just call God a C-word?

16:30.281 --> 16:31.700
Yeah. He's got a hard-on
for mass murder

16:31.741 --> 16:33.952
and giving kids cancer,
and his big old answer

16:33.993 --> 16:36.663
to the existential clusterfuck
that is humanity

16:36.705 --> 16:39.040
is to nail his own
bleeding son to a plank.

16:39.082 --> 16:40.291
That is a cunt move.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.751
Come on, even you got to agree
with me there.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.044
-Hey, hey, hey, please...
-We should lob

16:43.086 --> 16:44.879
a fucking nuke at him,
get it over and done with.

16:44.921 --> 16:48.383
-You know what I'm saying?
-We're sorry, sir.
We apologize. My man...

16:48.425 --> 16:49.843
All right.
Good talk. Think about it.

16:49.884 --> 16:52.178
-I'm here all day, all right?
-You mind

16:52.220 --> 16:53.513
piping it down
just a little bit? Huh?

16:53.555 --> 16:54.889
Oh, I'm sorry.
Didn't mean to offend

16:54.931 --> 16:57.183
your inner black Baptist mum
shouting "Praise the Lord."

16:57.225 --> 16:58.810
Fuck you, I'm Episcopalian.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.437
And there's nothing wrong
with having a little church

17:00.478 --> 17:02.021
up in you, you know?

17:02.063 --> 17:04.441
Said the bishop to the nun.
What about you, Hughie?

17:04.482 --> 17:06.860
You believe in God?

17:06.901 --> 17:08.111
I mean, I don't know.

17:08.153 --> 17:10.572
-What? Come off it.
-Yeah, I don't know.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.657
I don't think it's Morgan
Freeman up there or anything,

17:12.699 --> 17:15.118
but it can't all be
random chaos.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.703
So you think that
what happened to Robert

17:16.745 --> 17:18.079
was some kind of
divine intervention?

17:18.121 --> 17:20.832
-Is that what you're saying?
-Come on, Butcher.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.418
(phone rings)

17:23.460 --> 17:26.463
Hang about. Hello?

17:26.504 --> 17:28.465
DONNA:
So what were you
supposed to say?

17:28.506 --> 17:31.050
"Yes, I've had premarital sex,
go nuts."

17:31.092 --> 17:35.263
Well, I'm pretty sure I wasn't
supposed to lie to them, Mom.

17:35.305 --> 17:37.056
Aw, baby.

17:37.098 --> 17:39.768
You're Starlight of The Seven.

17:39.809 --> 17:42.520
Millions of kids are looking up
to you now.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.481
You're a shining light to them.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.357
How am I supposed
to live up to that?

17:46.399 --> 17:49.402
Because that's the way
God made you.

17:49.444 --> 17:52.155
You're a miracle.
You're my miracle.

17:53.531 --> 17:56.409
Hey... hey, you two.
How's it going?

17:56.451 --> 17:58.745
You know what?
I'll, I'll catch up.

17:58.787 --> 18:01.039
-DONNA: You sure?
-Don't worry,
I'll be right there.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.707
DONNA:
Mm-hmm.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.043
Keep an eye on the lad,
all right?

18:05.084 --> 18:08.129
Where the fuck are you going?

18:08.171 --> 18:09.798
Just do it.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.007
STARLIGHT:
Yeah.

18:11.049 --> 18:15.011
-You okay?
-Fine.

18:15.053 --> 18:18.431
It's just... this place isn't
what I remember.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.519
Hey...

18:32.028 --> 18:33.988
Hughie?

18:35.990 --> 18:37.367
Hey, can I ask you something?

18:37.408 --> 18:40.245
Anything.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.914
Is there any way you could
hook me up with one of those

18:42.956 --> 18:44.749
Diamond Club Passes?

18:44.791 --> 18:46.751
You know, to-to see Ezekiel?

18:46.793 --> 18:49.379
I mean, I couldn't get one
unless I robbed a bank.

18:49.420 --> 18:51.214
But... you know.

18:51.256 --> 18:53.091
Ezekiel?

18:53.132 --> 18:56.052
Yeah. Yeah. Um, okay.

18:56.094 --> 18:59.347
Confession time. My dad is,
like, Ezekiel's number one fan.

18:59.389 --> 19:01.975
Hmm.

19:02.016 --> 19:04.310
So what do you think?

19:04.352 --> 19:06.312
Pull a few strings, you know?

19:06.354 --> 19:08.022
Hook me up with some tickets?

19:11.109 --> 19:13.444
Yeah, yeah.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.531
Sure, of course.

19:16.573 --> 19:20.577
-It's the least I can do.
-Thank you.

19:25.707 --> 19:28.918
-(cheering, applause)
-Good to see you!

19:28.960 --> 19:32.547
Thanks, guys. Oh!
How are you, girls?

19:32.589 --> 19:34.132
Hey, pal, how are you?
How are you?

19:34.173 --> 19:36.009
Great, thanks for coming along.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.886
-God bless you guys!
-Thanks!

19:37.927 --> 19:40.555
God bless you one and all!

19:40.597 --> 19:44.183
Take care now.
Keep believing, ha-ha.

19:44.225 --> 19:45.643
Grab Madelyn.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.729
I need to talk to her about
these fucking talking points.

19:47.770 --> 19:50.815
Um... uh...
(chuckles nervously)

19:50.857 --> 19:53.151
Ms. Stillwell isn't here today.
I thought that you knew that.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.903
But I'm here to help you
with anything,

19:54.944 --> 19:56.946
I'll go through the talk...

19:59.157 --> 20:00.825
Ashley?

20:04.037 --> 20:06.372
Where is she?

20:12.795 --> 20:14.172
(whooshing)

20:17.634 --> 20:19.177
What are you doing here?

20:19.218 --> 20:20.178
Skipping work now?

20:20.219 --> 20:23.765
I am taking Teddy
to the pediatrician.

20:23.806 --> 20:25.058
Maybe reschedule it.

20:25.099 --> 20:27.435
I've already rescheduled
three times.

20:27.477 --> 20:28.811
What is the emergency?

20:28.853 --> 20:30.897
My speech.

20:30.939 --> 20:32.231
-Your speech?
-Yes. My speech.

20:32.273 --> 20:34.025
It reads like corporate
fucking mayonnaise.

20:34.067 --> 20:38.446
We're talking Believe here.
These are my people.

20:38.488 --> 20:40.573
But you're not just
talking to them.

20:40.615 --> 20:42.992
Every dove and Democrat
in Congress

20:43.034 --> 20:44.994
is going to be
watching you on CNN.

20:45.036 --> 20:46.412
-You need to appear moderate...
-No.

20:46.454 --> 20:47.705
-Humble.
-No!

20:47.747 --> 20:51.042
You-- There is
an opportunity here.

20:51.084 --> 20:54.504
People are scared.
They don't trust Washington

20:54.545 --> 20:57.799
or the coastal elite,
and they hate foreigners.

20:57.840 --> 21:02.053
What they want is a little
John Wayne frontier justice.

21:02.095 --> 21:04.973
And that is what I do.

21:07.976 --> 21:13.231
Don't forget... it was me that
saved that Flight 37 thing.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.067
I turned that into a win.
For us.

21:16.109 --> 21:19.362
You're really gonna talk to me
about "saving" Flight 37? Ha-ha.

21:19.404 --> 21:22.115
Well, why wouldn't I?

21:22.156 --> 21:25.243
Look, can I please just
talk to you later?

21:25.284 --> 21:26.452
The speech is perfect.

21:26.494 --> 21:28.579
-Trust me.
-Trust you.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.540
Okay.
That's what you always say.

21:30.581 --> 21:32.041
-Come here.
-You're not even fucking
listening to me.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.209
You're so full of shit!

21:33.251 --> 21:35.003
You say you want my input,

21:35.044 --> 21:36.087
but you don't.

21:36.129 --> 21:38.089
-Yes, I do.
-No, you don't.

21:38.131 --> 21:41.968
-And you never did.
-I do. Can we please
just talk later?

21:42.010 --> 21:47.265
Why? You gonna run off
and play "strong single mom"?

21:47.306 --> 21:50.309
Please...

21:50.351 --> 21:52.687
That baby is an accessory.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.775
We need boundaries.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.444
(car alarm chirps)

22:01.362 --> 22:03.781
(Teddy crying)

22:03.823 --> 22:06.159
(laughing)

22:11.289 --> 22:13.166
(knocking on door)

22:21.299 --> 22:22.925
Hey, Billy.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.512
Rachel.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.434
(Rachel sighs)

22:31.476 --> 22:34.771
Just took a lovely little stroll
around St. John's.

22:34.812 --> 22:38.232
And you'll never guess
what I happened across.

22:41.277 --> 22:42.779
Who told you?

22:42.820 --> 22:45.364
Well, I'll tell you who didn't
fucking tell me.

22:45.406 --> 22:46.949
Me own fucking sister-in-law.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.327
Would you like some tea?

22:49.368 --> 22:52.038
I got the English stuff.

22:55.666 --> 22:56.793
When'd you do it?

22:56.834 --> 23:00.171
Last Sunday.

23:00.213 --> 23:01.464
We used your last name.

23:01.506 --> 23:02.882
We said "beloved wife."

23:02.924 --> 23:05.051
You buried an empty
fucking coffin?

23:05.093 --> 23:08.304
We didn't bury anything.
Just, um, a headstone.

23:08.346 --> 23:10.056
Well, that's a sick fucking joke
then, isn't it?

23:10.098 --> 23:13.351
And you're wondering why we
didn't tell you. (chuckles)

23:13.392 --> 23:15.478
Look...

23:15.520 --> 23:18.272
my mom's getting old.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.316
She just wants a place to talk
to her daughter.

23:20.358 --> 23:22.360
Yeah, well, she's talking
to dirt, isn't she?

23:22.401 --> 23:24.570
-It's something.
-No.

23:24.612 --> 23:25.988
It's fucking nothing.

23:26.030 --> 23:28.783
It's nothing, 'cause there's
nothing fucking down there.

23:28.825 --> 23:31.619
And for all you know, Rebecca's
still out there somewhere,

23:31.661 --> 23:33.454
and you put up
a fucking headstone.

23:33.496 --> 23:34.455
Stop!

23:34.497 --> 23:36.749
You need to stop.

23:36.791 --> 23:39.669
It has been eight years since
she's been missing.

23:39.710 --> 23:44.173
The cops never found anything.
You never found anything.

23:44.215 --> 23:46.676
She's not alive.

23:46.717 --> 23:49.929
She got killed
or she killed herself.

23:49.971 --> 23:51.639
You watch your fucking mouth.

23:51.681 --> 23:55.810
You're not the only one
whose life was ruined.

23:55.852 --> 23:59.021
She is my sister,
and I love her.

23:59.063 --> 24:00.231
But she's gone.

24:02.817 --> 24:05.486
We need this to be over.

24:07.989 --> 24:09.782
(Rachel sighs)

24:15.746 --> 24:18.708
(panting)

24:19.750 --> 24:21.085
Ah!

24:23.671 --> 24:24.922
Oh, Popclaw.

24:24.964 --> 24:28.509
You got the right
to remain silent, bitch.

24:28.551 --> 24:31.429
I did not kill your partner.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.931
And I did not kill
Dr. Robinson.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.057
I wouldn't lie to you.

24:35.099 --> 24:36.893
I love you, baby.

24:36.934 --> 24:39.520
Love is just another lie,
Donovan.

24:39.562 --> 24:43.024
-You must think I'm stupid.
-No.

24:43.065 --> 24:46.152
POPCLAW:
But as you can see,

24:46.194 --> 24:49.447
I'm pretty sharp.

24:49.488 --> 24:53.951
DONOVAN:
Y-Yeah, you've got talent.

24:59.040 --> 25:02.376
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

25:02.418 --> 25:05.296
(both panting)

25:09.342 --> 25:11.969
-(static)
-POPCLAW: Oh! Yeah, say it.

25:12.011 --> 25:16.057
You're a filthy pig
who likes to eat ass.

25:16.098 --> 25:20.686
-I'm a filthy pig...
-(moaning)

25:22.563 --> 25:24.815
BUTCHER:
Hold up. Easy.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.901
Easy does it.
We ain't here to hurt you.

25:28.653 --> 25:29.946
POPCLAW:
Who are you?

25:42.959 --> 25:45.169
This guy's got 34 addresses

25:45.211 --> 25:48.172
and at least a dozen aliases.

25:48.214 --> 25:50.424
So, who the hell is he?

25:50.466 --> 25:53.511
Something we're running down
on our own.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.472
Uh, since when do you guys
run down stuff alone?

25:56.514 --> 25:57.640
-Trevor...
-Yeah?

25:57.682 --> 25:59.100
Shut up.

25:59.141 --> 26:02.019
(indistinct chatter)

26:07.149 --> 26:10.194
-Excuse me.
-Hughie.

26:11.445 --> 26:12.863
Right?
You're Starlight's friend.

26:12.905 --> 26:13.990
She got you in here.

26:14.031 --> 26:16.450
-Yeah.
-(chuckling): There you go.

26:16.492 --> 26:19.287
(chuckling)
Good to meet you, pal.

26:19.328 --> 26:21.706
-Good to meet you.
-(chuckles)

26:21.747 --> 26:23.833
How do you know Starlight?

26:23.874 --> 26:27.503
Uh, you know, we met, um,
like, a few weeks ago, actually.

26:27.545 --> 26:29.380
-Really?
-Yeah.

26:29.422 --> 26:32.675
-And she got you in here?
-Yeah, I guess she did.

26:32.717 --> 26:34.635
Oh, this is a
pricey ticket, Hughie.

26:36.637 --> 26:38.597
You must be a special guy.

26:38.639 --> 26:40.766
I-- no. No, I'm not...

26:40.808 --> 26:42.435
I just feel lucky
to be here. Really.

26:42.476 --> 26:44.895
EZEKIEL:
Um, ladies and gentlemen,

26:44.937 --> 26:47.690
uh, I would like to welcome you
one and all.

26:47.732 --> 26:51.444
And I would very much like to
welcome... Homelander,

26:51.485 --> 26:52.486
our special guest.

26:52.528 --> 26:56.866
(applause)

26:58.451 --> 27:02.204
So, without further ado,

27:02.246 --> 27:04.457
if you would follow me.

27:09.253 --> 27:10.713
Gather round, everybody.

27:10.755 --> 27:13.382
Now, as many of you
may already know,

27:13.424 --> 27:18.262
Homelander is an ordained
minister in Samaritan's Embrace.

27:18.304 --> 27:24.352
Together, we will be rebaptizing
you, my most loyal followers.

27:28.022 --> 27:30.066
Do you accept the Lord,
our Father, as your Savior,

27:30.107 --> 27:33.361
-and Jesus Christ his son?
-Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

27:33.402 --> 27:36.113
Then I baptize you
in the name of the Father,

27:36.155 --> 27:38.324
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

27:41.744 --> 27:43.704
-Oh!
-Your sins have been purged.

27:43.746 --> 27:46.957
Christ be with you.

27:46.999 --> 27:51.879
On this blessed day,
you will be reborn a Christian.

27:51.921 --> 27:54.882
You will be washed clean
of all your sins.

28:01.472 --> 28:03.432
Something wrong, Hughie?

28:03.474 --> 28:08.145
No. No, I'm-I'm
totally comfortable.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.647
Why-why would you ask that?

28:09.688 --> 28:13.526
Well, your blood pressure's
150/90. It's a bit high.

28:13.567 --> 28:16.070
Yeah, sorry. Just, um...

28:16.112 --> 28:17.279
I'm afraid of water.

28:17.321 --> 28:20.741
(chuckles)
Don't panic.

28:20.783 --> 28:22.660
I got you.

28:22.701 --> 28:26.789
Do you accept the Lord,
our Father, as your Savior,

28:26.831 --> 28:29.333
and Jesus...

28:29.375 --> 28:30.793
as his son?

28:33.212 --> 28:34.713
Yes.

28:34.755 --> 28:39.135
Hmm. Then I baptize you
in the name of the Father,

28:39.176 --> 28:40.428
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

28:50.438 --> 28:53.441
(coughing)

29:00.114 --> 29:02.074
God bless.

29:02.116 --> 29:04.577
Thank you all once again
for allowing me to be a part

29:04.618 --> 29:06.328
of this beautiful occasion.

29:06.370 --> 29:09.081
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Good night.

29:09.123 --> 29:10.499
See you, friend.

29:10.541 --> 29:12.126
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

29:12.168 --> 29:15.713
May the light of God
shine in your lives.

29:17.590 --> 29:19.049
Excuse me, sir.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.843
Uh, may I speak with you
just for a moment?

29:20.885 --> 29:23.637
-Sorry, son, I got
a packed schedule.
-All right, I understand, sir,

29:23.679 --> 29:25.639
but it's just,
I need your guidance.

29:25.681 --> 29:27.141
I need Christ's guidance.

29:28.184 --> 29:29.727
What is it?

29:29.768 --> 29:32.104
Just hold on... one second.

29:32.146 --> 29:33.689
Let me just show you something.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.991
(chuckles)
What's wrong?

29:44.033 --> 29:45.034
Uh...

29:48.496 --> 29:49.455
You fucked me.

29:49.497 --> 29:51.582
What?

29:51.624 --> 29:53.042
Yeah, in a private Supe club.

29:53.083 --> 29:55.586
You know the one on East 29th?
Secret Lair,

29:55.628 --> 29:57.254
-I think it's called?
-Don't know it. Nope.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.923
-There were three of us?
-You've got nothing...

29:58.964 --> 30:00.883
-Oiled up, and you...
-This...

30:00.925 --> 30:03.052
...wrapped your stretchy arms
around me, and it was, it was

30:03.093 --> 30:07.139
so fucking hot, and...
your dick was so... perfect.

30:07.181 --> 30:10.267
And long and... stretchy.

30:10.309 --> 30:13.479
And you... you played
my butt like jazz.

30:13.521 --> 30:18.192
With poise and skill and...
willingness to improvise.

30:20.277 --> 30:23.322
(choking)

30:29.912 --> 30:32.331
You come in here.

30:32.373 --> 30:33.958
You try to talk to me?

30:33.999 --> 30:36.252
-(choking)
-Like this?

30:36.293 --> 30:39.046
You are a filthy, filthy liar.

30:39.088 --> 30:41.215
-You are unclean.
-I have a video.

30:41.257 --> 30:42.841
-I have a video.
-What?

30:42.883 --> 30:45.427
I have a video
of the three of us...

30:45.469 --> 30:46.845
sucking and fucking.

30:46.887 --> 30:48.764
And if you don't let me go,

30:48.806 --> 30:50.516
my friend puts the video online.

30:50.558 --> 30:51.892
Like that.

30:51.934 --> 30:55.271
(grunting)

30:55.312 --> 30:57.356
(gasps, coughs)

30:57.398 --> 30:59.108
What do you want?
You want a little bit of money?

30:59.149 --> 31:00.442
Are you here for money?

31:00.484 --> 31:02.903
You ship boxes labeled
as polio vaccine

31:02.945 --> 31:05.114
but they're not really
polio vaccine, are they?

31:05.155 --> 31:07.032
(panting)
They're Compound V.

31:09.368 --> 31:12.246
-Who the hell are you?
-I want to know
everything about 'em.

31:12.288 --> 31:14.665
Okay? You tell me, you tell me
where they're going.

31:14.707 --> 31:16.875
And you tell me
how many boxes you ship.

31:16.917 --> 31:18.669
No.

31:18.711 --> 31:20.629
No, they will destroy me.

31:20.671 --> 31:22.381
Who's "they"? Vought?

31:24.466 --> 31:26.635
Here's how this is gonna go.

31:26.677 --> 31:28.512
You're gonna tell me,

31:28.554 --> 31:30.514
or that video...

31:30.556 --> 31:32.182
trends, number one on Twitter.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.684
Tonight.

31:33.726 --> 31:36.145
And you're also gonna stop

31:36.186 --> 31:38.731
the fucking
"pray the gay away" shit.

31:40.482 --> 31:42.610
Anyway, it's your choice.

31:42.651 --> 31:44.653
(phone ringing)

31:48.824 --> 31:50.242
Hello?

31:50.284 --> 31:53.412
Hey, um, so that wasn't
a piece of cake.

31:53.454 --> 31:54.872
Hughie, that you?
You all right?

31:54.913 --> 31:56.665
Yeah. Yeah, it's me, sorry.

31:56.707 --> 31:59.001
I had to, had to borrow a phone.
Thanks again.

31:59.043 --> 32:01.045
I got baptized.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.547
Yeah. It's a long story.

32:03.589 --> 32:06.133
Blackmailing somebody
is not cake, okay?

32:06.175 --> 32:08.719
It is weird, it's scary,
you wind up

32:08.761 --> 32:10.179
-just saying shit.
-Okay, but did you

32:10.220 --> 32:11.388
get him to talk?
What'd he say?

32:11.430 --> 32:12.640
Uh, yeah, yeah.

32:12.681 --> 32:14.183
I mean, you-you know
that charity of his?

32:14.224 --> 32:15.726
Samaritan's Embrace?

32:15.768 --> 32:17.186
-Right.
-All right.

32:17.227 --> 32:19.897
So what they do is they take
boxes full of that stuff

32:19.938 --> 32:22.066
and they ship it to hospitals
all across the country.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.484
And apparently the latest one

32:23.525 --> 32:25.486
is going to the NICU
at Mercer Hospital.

32:25.527 --> 32:27.988
It's, uh,
i-it's midtown, I think.

32:28.030 --> 32:30.658
You are a natural, kid.
You're like the fucking...

32:30.699 --> 32:32.201
Rain Man of fucking people over.

32:32.242 --> 32:34.244
(chuckles) Not a compliment.

32:58.852 --> 33:01.730
(grunting)

33:02.940 --> 33:04.525
(grunts)

33:04.566 --> 33:06.568
(panting)

33:09.655 --> 33:11.657
-Hey!
-Cool your jets, guv.

33:11.699 --> 33:14.535
-It's not a hate crime.
-(phone ringing)

33:16.829 --> 33:18.872
M.M.? All right.

33:21.583 --> 33:23.293
(laughs) Fucking brilliant.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.921
I'll meet you at the hospital
in half an hour.

33:27.423 --> 33:28.924
HOMELANDER:
Let's hear it for Jesus.

33:28.966 --> 33:31.343
-(cheering)
-Yes!

33:31.385 --> 33:34.763
One more for the guy upstairs!

33:34.805 --> 33:36.515
(Homelander laughs)

33:36.557 --> 33:38.559
Oh, I love you guys.
Let me tell you something.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.269
I am so thrilled to be here.

33:40.310 --> 33:41.937
Truthfully. Are you?

33:41.979 --> 33:43.564
-(cheering)
-Yeah?

33:43.605 --> 33:47.151
A terrible tragedy
befell our nation this week.

33:47.192 --> 33:48.777
Terrible.

33:48.819 --> 33:50.779
And let's not mince words
about this.

33:50.821 --> 33:55.075
We... were... attacked.

33:55.117 --> 33:56.452
(cheering)

33:56.493 --> 33:58.746
America was attacked.

33:58.787 --> 34:00.706
(cheering)

34:00.748 --> 34:02.416
Some people...

34:03.959 --> 34:05.461
...they want me
to come out here

34:05.502 --> 34:08.005
and speak empty platitudes
to you all.

34:08.046 --> 34:10.215
A little bit of corporate talk.

34:10.257 --> 34:12.718
But I don't want to do that.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.595
I can't do that.

34:14.636 --> 34:16.013
You want to know why?

34:16.054 --> 34:17.347
CROWD:
Why?

34:17.389 --> 34:21.685
Because I believe
that what God wants me to do

34:21.727 --> 34:24.104
is get on over there,
find the filthy bastards

34:24.146 --> 34:26.607
that masterminded this--
whatever cave they're in--

34:26.648 --> 34:29.985
and introduce them to a little
thing called God's judgment!

34:30.027 --> 34:32.029
-(cheering)
-That's what I think!

34:34.364 --> 34:36.742
Sounds like
the American thing to do!

34:36.784 --> 34:39.620
Sounds like
the right thing to do.

34:39.661 --> 34:42.581
But no. No, no, no, no, no.

34:42.623 --> 34:46.919
Apparently, I got to wait
for Congress to say it's okay.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.921
(crowd booing)

34:48.962 --> 34:50.297
HOMELANDER:
Right?

34:50.339 --> 34:53.467
I say I answer to a higher law.

34:53.509 --> 34:57.971
-(cheering)
-Wasn't I chosen to save you?

34:58.013 --> 35:01.517
-(cheering)
-Is it not my God-given purpose

35:01.558 --> 35:04.186
to protect the United States
of America?

35:04.228 --> 35:06.230
(cheering)

35:09.233 --> 35:11.401
CROWD (chanting):
Homelander! Homelander!

35:11.443 --> 35:14.154
-Homelander! Homelander!
-Psalm!

35:14.196 --> 35:16.073
58:10!

35:16.114 --> 35:18.575
"The righteous shall rejoice

35:18.617 --> 35:21.370
"when he sees the vengeance

35:21.411 --> 35:22.788
"and he will bathe his feet

35:22.830 --> 35:27.543
in the blood of the wicked."

35:27.584 --> 35:29.086
(cheering continues)

35:29.127 --> 35:31.672
MAN:
Homelander!

35:31.713 --> 35:35.092
CROWD (chanting):
Homelander! Homelander!

35:35.133 --> 35:37.803
(chanting continues)

35:37.845 --> 35:39.805
Motherfucker.

35:41.098 --> 35:43.100
(exhales deeply)

35:44.643 --> 35:46.395
(sighs)

35:47.437 --> 35:49.064
(knock on door)

35:54.820 --> 35:56.280
Hey.

35:56.321 --> 35:58.407
Maeve, what, uh...

36:00.117 --> 36:02.661
-Sorry, what are you...?
-I was, um, stopping a mugging

36:02.703 --> 36:05.414
nearby and I...

36:09.793 --> 36:11.169
It's good to see you.

36:13.463 --> 36:15.883
Can I come in?

36:15.924 --> 36:18.927
Uh... okay. (scoffs)

36:25.017 --> 36:27.519
Where's Freckles?

36:27.561 --> 36:30.439
Freckles died two years ago.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.651
Look, uh, I'm kind of busy,

36:34.693 --> 36:36.945
so, um, maybe give me a call,

36:36.987 --> 36:38.488
call first, next time?

36:38.530 --> 36:40.782
Elena, you don't
have to be like this.

36:40.824 --> 36:42.451
Well, you show up out of nowhere

36:42.492 --> 36:44.202
asking about
the goddamn cat, so...

36:47.289 --> 36:48.749
You've been drinking.

36:48.790 --> 36:50.709
-No.
-(Elena scoffs)

36:50.751 --> 36:52.836
You're not going
to meetings anymore.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.421
Uh, listen...
(chuckles, sniffles)

36:54.463 --> 36:56.048
Water under the bridge.

37:00.510 --> 37:02.054
I miss you.

37:02.095 --> 37:04.848
You don't get to say that to me.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.767
Leave, please.

37:06.808 --> 37:10.020
Elena, I haven't seen you
in years.

37:10.062 --> 37:11.480
I mean...

37:11.521 --> 37:14.775
-wouldn't it be nice...
-I see you every day.

37:14.816 --> 37:16.693
Every time I walk through
Times Square

37:16.735 --> 37:19.237
or turn on the fucking TV.

37:19.279 --> 37:21.198
I'm out of your life.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.824
You never left mine.

37:27.871 --> 37:30.582
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm really sorry.

37:30.624 --> 37:33.627
-I didn't mean...
-I don't want
your apology, okay?

37:33.669 --> 37:35.879
I want you to get out.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.715
Okay? I want you to go back
to your ivory penthouse

37:38.757 --> 37:42.260
where you can drink
and fuck whoever you want.

37:42.302 --> 37:44.262
Go back to Homelander.

37:47.015 --> 37:48.976
(laughs softly)

37:53.522 --> 37:55.482
I can't go back.

37:58.694 --> 38:00.487
Oh... (sniffles)

38:00.529 --> 38:03.365
-Oh...
-Maeve?

38:03.407 --> 38:04.992
It's too hard.

38:06.994 --> 38:09.663
-What happened?
-It's just too hard.

38:09.705 --> 38:11.832
Tell me what happened.

38:11.873 --> 38:14.876
(sniffles)
I keep thinking about all...

38:14.918 --> 38:17.170
-all those people.
-It's okay.
You'll figure it out.

38:17.212 --> 38:19.214
Okay? You'll figure it out.

38:19.256 --> 38:21.216
-You always know what to do.
-(sobbing)

38:21.258 --> 38:23.301
You always know
what to do, okay?

38:23.343 --> 38:26.763
-I don't know. They don't...
-So just tell me what happened.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.223
(sniffles)

38:28.265 --> 38:29.683
Tell me what happened.

38:33.729 --> 38:35.313
Uh...

38:35.355 --> 38:37.274
I don't know, Maeve,
if this is...

38:37.315 --> 38:39.317
-Come on.
-No. No, this is--

38:39.359 --> 38:43.196
You're obviously--
No, I said stop it.

38:43.238 --> 38:44.990
(exhales)

38:51.329 --> 38:54.166
All right, just...

38:54.207 --> 38:57.127
-just talk to me.
-(sniffles)

38:57.169 --> 38:59.588
Okay? Just tell me
what happened.

39:02.799 --> 39:05.594
Yeah, this, um...

39:05.635 --> 39:07.429
this was a mistake.

39:07.471 --> 39:10.098
No, just talk to me.
Just tell me what...

39:10.140 --> 39:13.310
If you... (groans)

39:21.651 --> 39:23.028
(phone vibrating)

39:26.364 --> 39:28.575
-Allo?
-CHERIE: They're coming.

39:28.617 --> 39:29.659
They're on to you, babe.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.745
Black Noir was outside
my apartment.

39:31.787 --> 39:33.914
What location?

39:33.955 --> 39:35.791
Which addresses do they have?

39:35.832 --> 39:37.125
If they got to my place,

39:37.167 --> 39:38.502
all of them.

39:51.056 --> 39:52.390
So, you want to pay me

39:52.432 --> 39:54.434
the professional courtesy
and tell me

39:54.476 --> 39:57.145
where the hell
you disappeared to before?

39:57.187 --> 39:59.022
I just had to pop down
to the shop.

39:59.064 --> 40:02.150
I was running a bit low on
mind your own fucking business.

40:04.236 --> 40:06.238
(phone ringing)

40:08.365 --> 40:09.825
This better be good.

40:09.866 --> 40:11.118
I'm burned.

40:11.159 --> 40:12.869
What? Fucking hell,
Frenchie. How?

40:12.911 --> 40:14.204
I don't know.

40:14.246 --> 40:15.580
What about the rest of us?

40:15.622 --> 40:17.624
Your concern for me
is very sweet.

40:17.666 --> 40:19.251
Maybe, maybe not.

40:19.292 --> 40:21.419
So far, they only seem to be

40:21.461 --> 40:24.005
hitting my places.
I'm taking off.

40:24.047 --> 40:26.258
-What about the girl?
-Fucking leave her.

40:28.844 --> 40:30.387
God knows
what they'll do to her.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.514
Supe-on-Supe violence
ain't our concern, mate.

40:32.556 --> 40:34.057
Butcher.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.017
I said fucking leave her.

40:36.059 --> 40:37.936
Merde.

40:39.146 --> 40:40.438
Burnt.

40:52.659 --> 40:56.913
It was the Heartland Beauties
"Luck of the Irish" pageant.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.957
The lights went out on stage

40:58.999 --> 41:01.918
and this one lit up the room
with the glow from her hands.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.880
The show must go on. Hmm?

41:04.921 --> 41:06.464
That's so sweet.

41:06.506 --> 41:08.925
-15 minutes, Starlight.
-I'm sorry, could you, could you

41:08.967 --> 41:10.594
just give us one minute, please?

41:10.635 --> 41:12.846
MAN (over P.A.):
Starlight will begin shortly.

41:12.888 --> 41:14.681
Please go to the main stage.

41:16.725 --> 41:19.686
Mom, I can't do this.

41:19.728 --> 41:21.271
A-Are you sick?
What's wrong?

41:21.313 --> 41:23.148
No, it just doesn't feel right.

41:23.190 --> 41:25.483
-What does that mean?
-Honestly...

41:25.525 --> 41:28.069
I really thought that being here
would feel like it used to,

41:28.111 --> 41:29.696
but it doesn't.

41:29.738 --> 41:31.656
It's changed,
or maybe I've changed.

41:31.698 --> 41:33.450
But...

41:35.452 --> 41:38.872
Mom, these past few months...

41:42.500 --> 41:44.669
Mm-mm.

41:44.711 --> 41:48.173
No, tell them I'm not going on.

41:48.215 --> 41:49.841
Honey.

41:51.843 --> 41:54.221
I've waited 23 years for this.

41:55.263 --> 41:56.973
This isn't...

41:57.015 --> 41:58.642
this isn't about you.

41:58.683 --> 42:00.393
Isn't it?

42:00.435 --> 42:02.312
I mean, I-I kept your secret,

42:02.354 --> 42:04.564
scrimped by selling houses,

42:04.606 --> 42:06.775
took you to all the Supe events.

42:09.110 --> 42:10.695
Please.

42:10.737 --> 42:13.615
All my friends
are gonna be watching on TV.

42:13.657 --> 42:15.450
Please?

42:21.289 --> 42:23.083
They're coming for me,
mon coeur.

42:23.124 --> 42:24.626
(zipper closes)

42:24.668 --> 42:26.836
The Supes.

42:26.878 --> 42:29.506
I've been ordered to leave you
here for them to find.

42:29.547 --> 42:31.800
And Monsieur Charcuter,
you know,

42:31.841 --> 42:35.011
he knows I'll comply,
that's how he sees me.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.097
Like this mad bastard,

42:37.138 --> 42:39.140
only good for hurting
or killing, you know?

42:39.182 --> 42:40.892
Like a gun, he takes me,

42:40.934 --> 42:43.812
points me in a direction
and fires.

42:43.853 --> 42:46.147
It's not who I am.

42:46.189 --> 42:47.941
(chains rattle)

42:47.983 --> 42:49.484
It's not who you are, either.

42:49.526 --> 42:51.820
We're the same, you and I.
Like eggs.

42:51.861 --> 42:54.781
Hard outside, soft inside--
or pineapples, perhaps.

42:55.865 --> 42:58.451
Whatever those bastards
got planned for you,

42:58.493 --> 43:00.829
you don't deserve it, mon coeur.

43:35.572 --> 43:37.907
(chuckles softly)

43:47.375 --> 43:48.960
NEWSWOMAN:
The Deep finds himself

43:49.002 --> 43:51.588
in hot water following
a harebrained attempt

43:51.629 --> 43:54.507
to free a dolphin
from Oceanland.

43:54.549 --> 43:56.801
Insiders say when police
tried to intercept

43:56.843 --> 43:58.970
the hijacked van,
Deep lost control

43:59.012 --> 44:01.181
of the vehicle and crashed,

44:01.222 --> 44:04.059
catapulting the dolphin
through the front windshield

44:04.100 --> 44:06.644
onto the road,
where it was run over

44:06.686 --> 44:09.064
-by an 18...
-Hello there, Believe Expo!

44:09.105 --> 44:10.648
(crowd cheering)

44:13.902 --> 44:17.947
I am so honored
to be here tonight.

44:17.989 --> 44:20.617
Did you know
that my first public appearance

44:20.658 --> 44:24.162
was right here
on this very stage

44:24.204 --> 44:26.373
with Ezekiel
and the rest of the family?

44:26.414 --> 44:28.041
(cheering)

44:33.046 --> 44:35.715
Today, I wanted
to share with you

44:35.757 --> 44:38.426
how I accepted Christ...

44:38.468 --> 44:41.137
as my personal savior.

44:41.179 --> 44:43.181
(cheering)

44:45.100 --> 44:48.937
How His way is the only way...

44:48.978 --> 44:50.980
(applause, cheering)

44:58.488 --> 45:00.782
Uh... (exhales)

45:00.824 --> 45:02.283
Just...

45:02.325 --> 45:05.370
just please stop the music.

45:05.412 --> 45:07.205
-Please stop.
-(music stops)

45:11.000 --> 45:12.710
(mouthing)

45:15.130 --> 45:19.384
You want me to just suck it up
and do this for you?

45:20.552 --> 45:22.262
Hmm?

45:22.303 --> 45:24.431
You have no idea
what you're really asking.

45:26.558 --> 45:30.645
You have no idea
what I've been through.

45:34.566 --> 45:37.110
(groans softly)

45:37.152 --> 45:41.781
Every single word that I say up
here, I'm reading from a script.

45:41.823 --> 45:44.159
I didn't write
any of these words.

45:44.200 --> 45:46.286
I don't even know
if I believe in them.

45:46.327 --> 45:50.039
I mean, I believe in God,
I love God so much, but...

45:50.081 --> 45:51.708
(chuckles)

45:51.749 --> 45:57.338
Honestly, it's...
it's just how goddamn certain

45:57.380 --> 46:00.383
everyone is around here.

46:00.425 --> 46:02.927
I mean, tickets start at,
what, 170 bucks,

46:02.969 --> 46:07.640
so that these people can tell
you how to get to heaven?

46:07.682 --> 46:10.310
How do they know?
How does anybody know?

46:10.351 --> 46:14.772
When the Bible was written, life
expectancy was 30 years old.

46:14.814 --> 46:19.110
I mean, I'm not so sure you're
supposed to take it literally.

46:19.152 --> 46:22.197
It also says
that it's a sin to eat shrimp.

46:22.238 --> 46:24.657
What, if you're gay
or if you're Gandhi,

46:24.699 --> 46:27.452
you're going to hell? I mean...

46:27.494 --> 46:29.662
And if you have sex
before marriage,

46:29.704 --> 46:32.457
that's, that's not immoral.

46:32.499 --> 46:34.125
That's human.

46:35.585 --> 46:37.754
What's immoral

46:37.795 --> 46:41.925
is the guy who shoved
his dick in my face.

46:41.966 --> 46:44.093
(crowd gasping)

46:44.135 --> 46:46.596
-Shit.
-Shit.

46:52.393 --> 46:53.811
(exhales)

46:57.732 --> 46:59.359
Here's the truth.

46:59.400 --> 47:04.030
Anyone who tells you they know
the answers is lying.

47:04.072 --> 47:05.990
And I know, I know,
I'm supposed to be

47:06.032 --> 47:09.118
this hero-idol-symbol-whatever,

47:09.160 --> 47:13.540
but I don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

47:13.581 --> 47:18.419
I'm just as scared and confused
as the rest of you.

47:18.461 --> 47:22.090
I'm done pretending,

47:22.131 --> 47:25.802
and I'm done
taking any more shit.

47:30.848 --> 47:32.892
Thank you.

47:43.194 --> 47:44.612
Excuse me.

47:57.709 --> 47:59.836
Jackpot.

47:59.877 --> 48:03.715
Compound V?
Oh, yeah, and lots of it.

48:07.260 --> 48:09.262
Oh, my God.

48:12.807 --> 48:14.892
Jesus.

48:14.934 --> 48:17.061
That's a fucking baby Supe.

48:22.692 --> 48:25.069
Chosen by God, my ass.

48:25.111 --> 48:27.739
These cunts are made
in a fucking lab.

48:33.953 --> 48:35.913
Hey.

48:35.955 --> 48:37.165
Hey, easy.

48:38.916 --> 48:41.169
That-that was a great speech.

48:41.210 --> 48:43.129
I mean, come on-- I mean,

48:43.171 --> 48:44.964
know your audience,
but that was, like,

48:45.006 --> 48:48.259
that was Joel at the Garden.
That was--

48:48.301 --> 48:52.055
I am so glad you enjoyed it.

48:52.096 --> 48:56.559
I'm so glad. How was your
quality time with Ezekiel? Huh?

48:56.601 --> 48:59.228
Any more VIP tickets
I can get for you?

48:59.270 --> 49:02.649
Because I'm so here for you.

49:02.690 --> 49:04.233
-It's not like that.
-You sure?

49:04.275 --> 49:06.361
'Cause I can get you
a commemorative cup.

49:06.402 --> 49:08.696
Or I can get you
an Ezekiel figurine,

49:08.738 --> 49:11.949
-or a goodie bag.
-My girlfriend died.

49:14.369 --> 49:15.787
What?

49:16.788 --> 49:18.206
Happened not too long ago,

49:18.247 --> 49:20.041
and I came here
looking for a way

49:20.083 --> 49:22.335
to get out of the shit
that I'm in right now.

49:22.377 --> 49:26.005
And that wasn't fair to you,
and I'm so sorry.

49:31.928 --> 49:33.680
I really don't think
there's anything

49:33.721 --> 49:37.684
that can help it anymore
or fix it...

49:37.725 --> 49:40.144
or make it better.

49:42.563 --> 49:46.234
And everything I heard here?

49:46.275 --> 49:49.112
Well, that helped
a total of jack shit.

49:51.197 --> 49:52.365
(chuckles, sniffles)

49:52.407 --> 49:54.200
Except for what you said.

49:54.242 --> 49:58.496
I mean, you're right,
there's-- nobody knows.

49:58.538 --> 50:00.498
And that's the only fucking
thing I've heard all day

50:00.540 --> 50:03.501
that's made any sense at all,

50:03.543 --> 50:06.379
and that is
the God's honest truth.

50:18.474 --> 50:21.060
-I'm so sorry.
-No, no, no.

50:21.102 --> 50:23.104
I'm sorry.

50:41.581 --> 50:43.249
MOTHER'S MILK:
Okay, easy with that.
You get some air in there,

50:43.291 --> 50:44.751
you could kill the kid.

50:44.792 --> 50:46.836
Well, wouldn't that
be a crying shame?

50:46.878 --> 50:49.213
All right.

50:49.255 --> 50:50.840
Let's bugger off.

50:50.882 --> 50:52.884
All right.

50:54.677 --> 50:56.179
Hey!

51:04.145 --> 51:06.773
Hey, keep them busy.

51:15.448 --> 51:17.909
Watch and learn, son.

51:29.587 --> 51:31.005
BUTCHER:
Hey.

51:31.047 --> 51:32.548
Hey.

51:34.509 --> 51:38.179
(laughs)
Holy fuck.

51:38.221 --> 51:41.182
That was diabolical.

51:41.224 --> 51:43.351
(laughs)

51:43.392 --> 51:46.687
You little fucking beauty.

51:46.729 --> 51:48.773
(panting)

51:51.984 --> 51:53.402
You done good, lad.

51:55.613 --> 51:58.199
-Come on, Butcher,
it's time to go.
-Yeah.

52:00.868 --> 52:02.829
Now, you keep
your nose clean, sunshine,

52:02.870 --> 52:05.373
or I'll come back and stomp you.

52:07.959 --> 52:11.003
Holy smokes, Starlight shocking
the Christian community

52:11.045 --> 52:13.422
during her address
at Believe Expo,

52:13.464 --> 52:15.258
when she questioned
her faith in...

52:24.934 --> 52:26.310
I see you.

52:27.687 --> 52:29.397
I know you're watching me.

52:29.438 --> 52:32.441
You've been out there
quite a lot lately.

52:33.693 --> 52:36.404
Always watching.

52:36.445 --> 52:39.198
So why don't you
just come on inside?

52:41.200 --> 52:42.785
You afraid of me?

52:42.827 --> 52:45.288
(scoffs)

52:48.708 --> 52:49.709
(door opens)

52:52.545 --> 52:54.380
Come in.

52:57.508 --> 52:59.468
(door closes)

53:05.892 --> 53:08.686
Have I not been paying
enough attention to you?

53:09.937 --> 53:11.898
Are you lonely?

53:11.939 --> 53:15.484
It must be hard,
feeling so alone.

53:18.154 --> 53:20.531
I'm sorry...

53:22.742 --> 53:27.538
...but you cannot
give a speech like that.

53:29.040 --> 53:31.000
You cannot be bad.

53:31.042 --> 53:33.044
(clears throat softly)

54:01.781 --> 54:03.366
Come here.

54:30.726 --> 54:33.229
You have to be good.

54:33.270 --> 54:36.232
And you have to listen to me.

54:36.273 --> 54:40.027
And then we both
can get what we want.

54:48.285 --> 54:49.787
(exhales)

54:49.829 --> 54:51.998
That's good.

54:56.127 --> 54:58.129
You're my good boy.

55:13.060 --> 55:15.062
(panting)

55:24.321 --> 55:27.116
(panting)

55:51.932 --> 55:55.269

55:58.606 --> 56:01.358
