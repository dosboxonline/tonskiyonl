01:17.510 --> 01:19.179
[Bridget] Fuck, fuck, fuck!
So late!

01:20.480 --> 01:21.815
[Billy] Mabel's put a scarf on
the cat.

01:21.848 --> 01:24.184
[Mabel] He's not a cat.
He's my husband.

01:24.217 --> 01:26.186
Where is he?

01:26.219 --> 01:29.189
-Will he bring the ladies with
the big boobies?
-"Ladies"?

01:29.222 --> 01:31.324
[Mabel] Last time,
he brushed my hair with a fork.

01:31.358 --> 01:33.727
[Billy] There were three ladies,
and they had
an epic pillow fight.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.396
-The fork had maple syrup on it.
-Out of the way, darling.

01:36.429 --> 01:37.864
-[Mabel clears throat]
-Well,

01:37.897 --> 01:40.533
it's obvious he's not coming,
so I'll just stay home.

01:40.567 --> 01:43.503
You said this was the one thing
you had to leave the house for
this year.

01:43.536 --> 01:44.704
[Bridget sighs]
You're right. I'm going.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.406
Move, please, Mabes.

01:48.641 --> 01:51.611
Fuck-- caccia.

01:51.644 --> 01:53.346
Did we eat the focaccia?

01:54.814 --> 01:57.751
[sighs] Well,
we haven't got any vegetables.

01:57.784 --> 02:02.355
But lucky you, you get to have
frozen peas. Mmm.

02:02.389 --> 02:04.624
All right. Come to the table.

02:04.657 --> 02:06.459
Come on.

02:06.493 --> 02:10.930
One, two...

02:10.964 --> 02:13.433
[Bridget] What am I going to do
when I get to three?

02:13.466 --> 02:14.934
-[smoke alarm blares]
-[Bridget exclaiming]

02:14.968 --> 02:16.569
[smoke alarm]
Please enter alarm code.

02:16.603 --> 02:18.371
[Bridget]
Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck!

02:18.405 --> 02:20.473
-Please enter alarm code.
-No! Don't put the flames out.

02:20.507 --> 02:22.509
-We can toast marshmallows.
-Please enter alarm code.

02:22.542 --> 02:24.377
Please--

02:24.411 --> 02:25.945
[gasps, sighs]

02:29.949 --> 02:30.784
[sighs]

02:30.817 --> 02:34.854
The tension of our bodies,

02:35.955 --> 02:38.258
-the scars of--
-[phone ringing]

02:38.291 --> 02:39.826
[automated phone voice]
Hello, Moto.

02:43.863 --> 02:45.665
[woman] ...in-- in our longing.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.267
Bridget Jones, always exciting.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.803
-How's the skirt?
-Daniel, hi. [sighs]

02:49.836 --> 02:52.305
Just checking you have indeed
forgotten about tonight.

02:52.339 --> 02:55.842
That is hurtful, Jones.
I have absolutely not forgotten.

02:55.875 --> 02:57.644
-[audience shushes]
-No.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.746
I'm so sorry. It's my mother.

02:59.779 --> 03:01.748
-She's in the hospital.
-[audience member] Oh.

03:01.781 --> 03:03.950
-Primordial sweat.
-I will be there

03:03.983 --> 03:06.653
quicker than
it took me to bring you to
earth-shattering orgasm,

03:06.686 --> 03:08.421
you filthy little harlot.

03:08.455 --> 03:10.990
[audience murmuring]

03:13.727 --> 03:14.861
Love you, Mummy.

03:16.429 --> 03:17.530
"Mummy"?

03:17.564 --> 03:18.965
Darling, clever Geminita.

03:18.998 --> 03:21.701
I'm gonna have to rush.
It's a family emergency.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.703
But I am loving this one.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.572
I think-- I think we all are,
aren't we?

03:25.605 --> 03:27.340
Call me later, yeah?

03:28.708 --> 03:29.776
Oh, yeah.

03:29.809 --> 03:32.579
I am imminent, Jones. Imminent.

03:32.612 --> 03:34.280
Un-bunch those giant panties.

03:42.489 --> 03:43.957
[Bridget groans]

03:43.990 --> 03:45.725
[Bridget] Bloody zip
manufacturers should be

03:45.759 --> 03:47.861
cancelled
for sociological bias.

03:47.894 --> 03:51.598
It is actually impossible
to do this on your own.

03:51.631 --> 03:54.434
[sighs] Help.

03:59.506 --> 04:01.541
-Ooh. Thank you, monkeys.
-[horn honks]

04:01.574 --> 04:02.909
Uncle Daniel!

04:02.942 --> 04:04.477
Miniature Darcy,
what's the news?

04:04.511 --> 04:06.012
[Billy] Where are the ladies
with the big--

04:06.046 --> 04:07.947
[Daniel] Hair?
They couldn't make it, sadly.

04:07.981 --> 04:09.749
They're, um...
They're washing their hair.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.384
All three?

04:11.418 --> 04:12.952
Yeah, well, they wash each
other's, you see.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.655
I thought you said
no more models.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.490
Geminita is not a model, Jones.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.459
She is a poet and a healer,

04:19.492 --> 04:20.627
and a model.

04:20.660 --> 04:21.795
Come here.

04:23.530 --> 04:24.764
Hell of a night for you.

04:24.798 --> 04:27.701
Ugh, I can't go.
The children need me.

04:27.734 --> 04:29.102
Uncle Daniel!

04:29.135 --> 04:30.904
You. Right.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.440
Get a fork and some syrup.
I'm gonna style you.

04:33.473 --> 04:35.975
-[Billy] I found the cards.
-[Daniel] Very good. Excellent.

04:36.009 --> 04:40.046
Now then, we need to work on
your bluffing and your cheating.

04:58.765 --> 05:01.468
[Bridget]
Life has its white notes...

05:04.738 --> 05:07.874
and life has its black notes.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.947
You look very beautiful tonight,
Mrs Darcy.

05:13.980 --> 05:17.350
Not looking so bad yourself,
Mr Darcy.

05:21.554 --> 05:23.390
[doorbell rings]

05:32.632 --> 05:34.000
Bridget.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.069
[Bridget] Very black notes.

05:36.102 --> 05:38.972
Jolly good. Come in.
Weather's been a bit shitty,
hasn't it?

05:39.005 --> 05:40.573
-Though the cricket this year
has been...
-Jeremy.

05:40.607 --> 05:43.109
...absolutely phenomenal.

05:45.111 --> 05:46.980
[Bridget] This is what happened.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.683
Mark Darcy, my husband,

05:49.716 --> 05:51.818
father to Billy and Mabel,

05:51.851 --> 05:53.687
died.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.989
Or rather, was killed

05:56.022 --> 05:59.426
in the Sudan on
a humanitarian mission.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.630
-Everybody's just upstairs.
-Thanks.

06:03.663 --> 06:06.666
[Bridget] And that was four
years ago. Today, actually.

06:08.168 --> 06:11.037
Brace yourself.
It's a total fucking shit show.

06:11.071 --> 06:16.743
[Bridget] And even though there
might be 600,000 words in
the human language,

06:16.776 --> 06:20.013
the world still struggles
to find the right ones

06:20.046 --> 06:22.949
when someone you love is gone.

06:22.982 --> 06:24.751
Bridget, how are the children?

06:24.784 --> 06:26.019
-[woman] Mmm.
-Are they--

06:26.052 --> 06:27.921
Are they all right without
you there?

06:27.954 --> 06:30.990
-[guests murmuring]
-No. It's fine.

06:31.024 --> 06:34.060
Left them some crystal meth
in the kitchen.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.764
[Bridget] Maybe not.

06:37.797 --> 06:39.866
Well, we don't make a thing
about it.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.935
We celebrate Mark's birthday
instead.

06:41.968 --> 06:43.069
[guests] Oh.

06:43.103 --> 06:45.505
So, Bridget, still on your own?

06:45.538 --> 06:47.140
[man] It's been four years now.

06:47.173 --> 06:49.709
You're still
in pretty good nick.
Why no chap?

06:49.743 --> 06:52.912
Now, now. It's not Bridget's
fault. Very hard,
being a middle-aged woman

06:52.946 --> 06:54.547
-and finding yourself single.
-[guests] Mmm.

06:54.581 --> 06:57.951
Better if you're a bloke.
Look at Binko Carruthers.

06:57.984 --> 06:59.552
He's no oil painting,

06:59.586 --> 07:02.722
but the second Rosemary died,
he was inundated.

07:02.756 --> 07:06.559
Of course, they were all of
a certain age, though,
weren't they?

07:06.593 --> 07:08.695
Sorry, do you realise
you said that out loud?

07:08.728 --> 07:11.064
-[laughs]
-Hmm?

07:11.097 --> 07:14.100
"A certain age"?
What, do you mean our age?

07:14.134 --> 07:16.202
-That is the most...
-[Bridget] Shazzer now hosts

07:16.236 --> 07:17.804
a podcast calledFed Up,

07:17.837 --> 07:19.606
in which she has dinner
with minor celebrities

07:19.639 --> 07:22.142
while basically getting furious
about everything.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.210
...sexist fucking universe
we, unbelievably,

07:24.244 --> 07:27.047
still continue
to fucking inhabit.

07:29.582 --> 07:30.483
[mouthing word]

07:31.951 --> 07:33.687
I need to go to the toilet.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.121
[guests] Oh.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.190
[woman] Oh, dear.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.261
Yeah, Jude.
Yeah, I'm with her now.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.997
[Jude] Well, Shaz, tell her
to come to The Golden Cock.

07:44.030 --> 07:47.300
No, no, no. The party.
It's for Mark.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.969
That's not a party.
That's a fucking bin fire.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.839
And you think that Mark
would want you to stay here
and be insulted

07:52.872 --> 07:55.108
in the fucking sexism Olympics?

07:55.141 --> 07:57.010
[Bridget's friends] To Mark.

07:57.043 --> 07:58.244
-And to Bridget...
-[Bridget] Aw.

07:58.278 --> 07:59.746
...and the rare pleasure
of seeing you

07:59.779 --> 08:01.247
-in something not made
of terry towelling.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.283
-[Shaz laughs]
-[Bridget] Tom, still living

08:03.316 --> 08:05.919
handsomely off
his one hit single

08:05.952 --> 08:10.290
which had a comeback recently
in a 30-second video of
a dog doing maths.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.226
Now, of all things,
a life coach.

08:13.259 --> 08:15.995
Honestly, I'd say it was
a bit of a breakthrough,

08:16.029 --> 08:18.164
speaking as your psychologist.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.933
[laughs]
You're not my psychologist.

08:19.966 --> 08:21.801
Well, I should be, yes.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.570
According to the classic model,

08:23.603 --> 08:25.772
you've actually made it
to the fourth stage

08:25.805 --> 08:29.609
-of the five stages of grief.
-Wait. Isn't it seven stages?

08:29.642 --> 08:32.145
What are you talking about,
Jude? No, it isn't.
It's five stages.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.179
-Isn't it five?
-Well, I always thought
it was four.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.815
[Jude] It's definitely seven.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.150
[Bridget] Jude, now CEO or COO

08:38.183 --> 08:40.986
or CTO,
definitely a C-something-O,

08:41.020 --> 08:44.624
still regularly calling,
in tears,
from executive bathroom.

08:44.657 --> 08:48.028
So, um, only one stage to
go now, Bridge.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.330
-[Bridget] Oh.
-[clears throat] Stage five.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.932
It's acceptance,
which basically means

08:52.966 --> 08:56.169
-you just have to get laid.
-Oh, my God. Shazzer's right.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.239
Yes. I mean, honestly, darling,
look at yourself.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.641
You've become
a born-again virgin.

09:01.675 --> 09:05.045
If you don't get laid soon,
your vagina will literally
reseal itself.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.047
[Shaz] Yeah, and that is
a thing.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.316
It's called labial adhesion.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.985
[Bridget] Oh, my God!

09:12.018 --> 09:15.188
I knew leaving the kitchen was
a mistake.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.990
I don't want anyone else.

09:17.023 --> 09:18.725
And even if I did,
which I don't,

09:18.758 --> 09:21.928
I'm non-viable,
completely asexual,

09:21.961 --> 09:24.030
and nobody will
ever fancy me again.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.799
-Ever, ever, ever.
-No. No, no, no.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.701
And I'm going to the toilet.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.004
Crash and burn.
That was a disaster.

09:31.037 --> 09:32.205
Well, that was
a fucking disaster.

09:32.238 --> 09:35.642
[Bridget yawns]

09:36.409 --> 09:38.778
Crikey. Have we been burgled?

09:38.812 --> 09:41.014
[Daniel] We have not
been burgled, Jones. No.

09:41.047 --> 09:43.283
We have been marvellous.
Now, tell me this.

09:43.316 --> 09:47.821
For Tonya, do we think a kitten
heel or a chunky wedge?

09:47.854 --> 09:48.822
She's going to Wimbledon.

09:48.855 --> 09:50.690
Wedge, obviously.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.325
You may be right.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.828
How was it? Any fun? Any tongue?

09:54.861 --> 09:58.965
Ugh. God. No tongue.
I have hung up my tongue.

09:58.998 --> 10:00.767
How were they?

10:00.800 --> 10:02.335
Well, the girl is you.

10:02.369 --> 10:06.706
Lawless, romantic,
irresistibly drawn to me.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.708
Asked me if I was going
to be her new daddy.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.243
She does that.

10:10.276 --> 10:13.680
Yeah. Wouldn't go to bed
until I'd married her rabbit.

10:13.713 --> 10:16.016
-Hmm.
-[Daniel] Which I was very happy
to do.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.984
That rabbit is not
at all unfanciable.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.386
[Bridget] Hmm.
And Billy?

10:19.419 --> 10:21.955
Well, Billy is Darcy, isn't he?

10:21.988 --> 10:24.357
Still waters and all that.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.726
As it happens, Jones, your son

10:26.760 --> 10:29.062
and I have a number
of shared interests.

10:29.095 --> 10:31.398
Oh, God. Like what?

10:31.431 --> 10:32.766
Models.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.768
He showed me his,
I showed him mine.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.704
-Hmm.
-And then we--
we talked about death.

10:37.737 --> 10:38.738
Did you?

10:38.772 --> 10:40.774
[Daniel] Yeah.
I told him being dead was shit.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.176
And that I should know
because I was for a bit.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.844
And then, uh... [sighs]

10:44.878 --> 10:47.781
I gave him a hug
'cause he seemed a bit sad.

10:47.814 --> 10:50.450
And then that made me sad
because... [sighs]

10:50.483 --> 10:52.152
-[Bridget] How is your boy?
-[groans]

10:52.185 --> 10:54.254
Enzo's, what? He's...

10:54.287 --> 10:56.356
Uh, fuck knows, Jones.
Fifteen, I think.

10:56.389 --> 11:01.294
Anyway, we then cheered
ourselves up by digging out
the cocktail shaker,

11:01.327 --> 11:03.263
and I taught him how
to make a Dirty Bitch.

11:03.296 --> 11:04.864
Saved it for you.
It's in the fridge.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.200
-Goody. Have it for breakfast.
-[phone rings]

11:07.233 --> 11:09.302
Yeah, hello, hello,
hello, hello.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.904
Geminita.

11:10.937 --> 11:13.206
Yeah, we're all done. All done.
I'm on my way.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.242
Well, as quick as I can.

11:16.276 --> 11:20.013
Yes, like naughty old moth
to eager young flame.

11:20.046 --> 11:22.482
No, you hang up first.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.318
And-- OK, kiss you back.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.886
-[laughs]
-[Daniel sighs]

11:26.920 --> 11:29.189
[stammers] Yeah, OK. Louder.
Yeah. [kisses]

11:29.222 --> 11:31.057
-Oh, my God.
-[phone closes]

11:31.091 --> 11:34.160
[laughing]

11:34.194 --> 11:36.496
Fuck off, Jones.
OK, they're asleep.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.932
Um... [sighs]
...it did take a bit of time.

11:38.965 --> 11:41.067
But I-- Actually I showed them
a video of Geminita

11:41.101 --> 11:43.970
reciting one of her prose poems
and they were out like a light.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.271
[scoffs]

11:46.840 --> 11:47.807
All right.

11:48.975 --> 11:52.212
[sighs] What happens now?

11:52.245 --> 11:55.081
I'm trying to remember how it
worked with our babysitters.

11:55.115 --> 11:58.952
I think you give me 20 quid
and try and shag me, don't you?

11:58.985 --> 12:02.255
[Bridget] Ah, Daniel,
dear Daniel.

12:02.288 --> 12:04.991
At least some things
never change.

12:05.025 --> 12:08.361
It makes me sad though, Jones.
You know...

12:08.395 --> 12:13.433
two children and you all alone
and effectively a nun.

12:13.466 --> 12:16.803
Albeit, of course,
a very, very naughty nun.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.243
Bye, Daniel.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.411
Yeah.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.946
Thanks for tonight.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.014
Yeah.

12:32.852 --> 12:35.522
[Bridget] Why are these lights
still on?

12:35.555 --> 12:37.857
I thought you two were asleep.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.261
Do you miss Dada sometimes?

12:41.294 --> 12:43.396
I miss him all of the times.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.531
[Mabel gasps]

12:48.435 --> 12:51.237
[gasps] There's my owl.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.139
[Bridget] Back to bed. Come on.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.408
-Story, Mama?
-[Bridget] Mm-hmm.

13:00.647 --> 13:06.553
For the baby princess is
as kind as she is fair.

13:06.586 --> 13:13.426
And the baby prince is as gentle
as he is handsome.

13:13.460 --> 13:17.597
And wherever they go
and whatever they do,

13:17.630 --> 13:21.301
Mummy and Daddy
will always love them.

13:21.334 --> 13:26.006
-And Saliva.
-[laughs, coughs]

13:26.039 --> 13:29.142
She stinks, Mabes.

13:29.175 --> 13:31.211

-Oh!

13:31.244 --> 13:32.946
[chuckles]

13:38.084 --> 13:39.986
-Good night, darling.
-Good night, Mama.

13:46.993 --> 13:47.994
Good night.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.498
[Billy] And all the thoughts...

13:54.968 --> 13:58.071
And all the thoughts
are going away.

13:58.104 --> 14:02.475
They don't need little Billy
and Mabel tonight.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.912
The world
will turn without them.

14:05.945 --> 14:09.015
[Bridget and Mark] The stars
will shine without them.

14:09.049 --> 14:15.422
And all little Billy and Mabel
need to do is rest and sleep.

14:17.123 --> 14:18.391
Good night.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.193
Night.

14:25.432 --> 14:26.966
[Mark] Good night, Billy.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.669
-Do the song, Daddy. Please.
-[Mark] OK.

14:29.703 --> 14:35.075
* I'll do anything
For you, dear*

* Anything*

14:36.609 --> 14:41.548
* For you mean everything

15:10.443 --> 15:12.712
You don't want to wallow in it,
darling.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.281

And there they are again.

15:15.315 --> 15:18.351
All the voices, all the advice.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.353
You gotta wallow in it, Bridge.
Wallow.

No, it's, "I before E
except after C."

15:31.464 --> 15:33.033
Yes, exactly.

15:33.066 --> 15:36.302
God, you really are such
a T-W-T-A.

-[Tom] A what?
-[Shaz laughs]

15:37.771 --> 15:39.639
[Bridget]
The thing about advice is,

15:39.673 --> 15:43.510
no one tells you
the same thing twice.

15:43.543 --> 15:46.646
Bridget, you've got
to put the children first.

15:46.680 --> 15:50.383
[Bridget] Uh-huh. Thank you,
Magda. Yes.

15:50.417 --> 15:53.219
Put the children first.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.454

15:54.487 --> 15:57.424
Put your own oxygen mask
on first.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.326
[Bridget] Right. Oxygen mask.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.594
Got it.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.530
One thing's for certain, Bridge.

16:03.563 --> 16:06.166
Forget about sex.
[hiccups] Oh.

16:06.199 --> 16:07.734
[Bridget] OK.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.602
No sex.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.604
You need to have a lot of sex.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.774
Yeah. Why don't you come back
to work?

16:14.808 --> 16:18.778
[Bridget] Thank you, Richard.
I'll bear that in mind.

16:31.524 --> 16:34.527
But as my dad said
just before he died,

16:34.561 --> 16:37.464
the big question is...

16:37.497 --> 16:39.532
Can you survive?

16:42.435 --> 16:43.536
I think so.

16:44.604 --> 16:45.805
I have to.

16:48.141 --> 16:49.142
I'm trying.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.814
It's not enough to survive.
You've got to live.

Bridget, you know what
the doctor said
about saturated fats.

17:09.229 --> 17:13.299
Pam, could you take a photograph
of us? Me and Bridget.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.104
Um...

17:20.173 --> 17:22.709
Colin, try not to do that with
your chin.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.644
I'm not doing anything with
my chin.

-Right.
-Mr Walliker?

22:40.026 --> 22:43.029
Mr Walliker, Eros tells me
he hasn't been selected for
the choir for some reason.

22:43.063 --> 22:45.065
-Correct.
-Well, how can that be?

22:45.098 --> 22:47.567
Because he can't sing.
Anything else,
Mrs Soltani-Watkins?

22:47.600 --> 22:50.570
Mr Walliker, if you have failed
to recognise
Eros's obvious talents,

22:50.603 --> 22:52.472
-that's hardly his fault.
-It's really quite simple.

22:52.505 --> 22:55.075
The choir, like everything else
in nature, is chosen on merit.

22:55.108 --> 22:57.477
Yeah, natural selection.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.879
If Eros wants
to put in the work,
he's welcome to audition again.

If you'll excuse me.

Move along, please. Right away!

You two! This isn't a stroll on
the heath.

deck chairs and unwrapping
sandwiches, do you?

I've got worms!

24:03.109 --> 24:05.111
Why is your granny
wearing pyjamas?

24:06.913 --> 24:08.715
[Bridget] That went well.

24:10.850 --> 24:13.586
"G-O-N-O"--

24:13.620 --> 24:15.221
[Bridget]
That's lovely, darling.

24:15.255 --> 24:17.057
-"R-H"...
-There you go.

24:17.090 --> 24:18.958
One tablet a day for
the entire family,

24:18.992 --> 24:22.195
and if her itching doesn't stop,
I suggest you get rid of
that cat.

24:22.228 --> 24:24.564
[clears throat]
Have you got some help yet?

24:24.597 --> 24:26.599
I know it doesn't look it,
but really,

24:26.633 --> 24:29.035
-I've got it all in hand.
-No, it doesn't look it.

24:29.069 --> 24:32.272
Apart from anything else,
I'm a gynaecologist,
not a paediatrician.

24:32.305 --> 24:35.975
And whilst I'm happy to step in,
you do take my point.

24:36.009 --> 24:39.713
If you say "oxygen mask"
to me again, I will hit you
with this handbag.

24:39.746 --> 24:41.047
I am not afraid of handbags.

24:41.081 --> 24:43.183
You need something else to do.

24:43.216 --> 24:45.618
You need a reason
to get out of those pyjamas.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.721
Well, fashion's never
really been your thing.

24:47.754 --> 24:49.856
-Rude.
-Pyjamas are all the rage
in Milan.

24:49.889 --> 24:53.193
Bridget, in spite of
all objective evidence to
the contrary,

24:53.226 --> 24:55.195
you are a bright, talented,
brilliant woman.

24:55.228 --> 24:57.731
And my professional advice
to you is this.

24:57.764 --> 24:59.032
-You need--
-No. No, no, no.

24:59.065 --> 25:00.700
Please don't tell me to go
and have sex.

25:00.734 --> 25:01.935
Oh, good Lord, no.

25:01.968 --> 25:04.070
[scoffs] No.

25:04.104 --> 25:06.606
Read a book.
Clean out the kitchen drawers.

25:06.639 --> 25:08.875
Leave the pink bits
well enough alone.

25:08.908 --> 25:10.143
You'll be ready when
you're ready.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.946
No, my professional advice
to you is this:

25:12.979 --> 25:15.281
go back to work.

25:15.315 --> 25:17.050
And how's your love life?

25:17.817 --> 25:19.652
On fire.

25:19.686 --> 25:23.123
"Sy-P-Lis."

25:26.126 --> 25:29.696
-[Bridget] Mmm.
-Syphilis. Mabel, Syphilis.

25:29.729 --> 25:30.830
Syphilis.

25:30.864 --> 25:33.099
Mmm. Very good. Very good.

25:33.133 --> 25:36.169
And there's
some delicious vegetarian
alternatives here too.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.004
[both chuckle]

25:38.038 --> 25:40.807
Floods, fires and famine.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.810
As the world teeters on
the edge
of climate catastrophe,

25:43.843 --> 25:46.646
sausages aren't the only thing
we are grilling today.

25:46.680 --> 25:50.316
Environment Secretary
Sarah Givens
joins us after the break.

25:50.350 --> 25:53.019
[theme music playing on TV]

25:53.053 --> 25:54.654
[phone rings]

25:54.688 --> 25:55.955
Hi.

25:55.989 --> 25:57.057
Oh, thank God you picked up.

25:57.090 --> 25:59.059
-[spits]
-What's the matter?

25:59.092 --> 26:01.661
They've got the bloody
Environment Secretary on
in 45 seconds

26:01.695 --> 26:04.364
and they've got me asking
her questions about
bloody tea bags.

26:04.397 --> 26:06.666
"What's the best way to recycle
tea bags?"

26:06.700 --> 26:08.702
"Can you clean surfaces
with tea"...

26:08.735 --> 26:09.736
I need you, Bridget!

26:09.769 --> 26:11.671
OK. Uh...

26:11.705 --> 26:13.373
Ask her... [gasps]

26:13.406 --> 26:15.742
Ask her why there were
no tax breaks
for renewable energy

26:15.775 --> 26:17.644
-in last week's budget.
-Brilliant.

26:17.677 --> 26:20.180
She'll fob you off with some
crap about economic constraints

26:20.213 --> 26:24.284
and then you nail her on oil
and gas companies ring-fencing
their profits.

26:24.317 --> 26:26.886
-Yes, I do.
-[chuckles] She'll flap!

26:26.920 --> 26:30.690
And then you nuke her arse
on the government's support
for fracking.

26:30.724 --> 26:31.825
[gasps] Ooh.

26:31.858 --> 26:33.760
I fracking love you,
Bridget Jones.

26:33.793 --> 26:35.362
-Hi, Bridge.
-Yes!

26:35.395 --> 26:39.199
Oh, oh, oh! Do try to find out
about the tea bags though.

26:39.232 --> 26:41.167
-Love you. Bye. Bye.
-Love you. Bye! [kisses]

26:43.169 --> 26:44.704
Welcome back.

26:44.738 --> 26:46.106
Our next guest is

26:46.139 --> 26:48.241
Environment Secretary
Sarah Givens.

26:48.274 --> 26:53.046
Sarah, budget,
tax breaks, fracking.

26:53.079 --> 26:55.015
Justify.

26:55.048 --> 26:56.416
And no fob-off!

26:59.819 --> 27:03.056
Could you please put me through
to Richard Finch's office?

27:03.089 --> 27:05.158
My name's Bridget Jones.

27:06.092 --> 27:08.428
Yeah. I'll hold. Thanks.

27:11.765 --> 27:12.899
[sighs]

27:17.203 --> 27:18.905
[video game beeps]

27:24.444 --> 27:26.880
Billy,
I want to watch SpongeBob.

27:28.148 --> 27:29.482
Billy, come off that, please.

27:29.516 --> 27:31.184
You've had your screen time.

27:32.085 --> 27:33.987
One, two...

27:34.020 --> 27:35.422
But, Mummy, it's Sunday.

27:35.455 --> 27:36.322
No.

27:36.356 --> 27:37.424
Can I watch SpongeBob?

27:37.457 --> 27:40.160
May I watch SpongeBob.

27:40.193 --> 27:41.761
Yes?

27:41.795 --> 27:43.997
No, you've got to say,
"may I," not "can I."

27:44.030 --> 27:45.165
May I watch SpongeBob?

27:45.198 --> 27:47.767
-No.
-But, Mummy!

27:47.801 --> 27:49.336
No, no, no, no.

27:49.369 --> 27:52.005
No more screens, either of you.

27:52.038 --> 27:54.407
Screens have been
proven to shorten
attention spans and...

27:54.441 --> 27:56.109
-[phone chimes]
-Ooh!

27:56.142 --> 27:57.944
No.

27:57.977 --> 28:00.113
Will you come and practise
cricket with me in the garden?

28:00.146 --> 28:02.782
Mummy really needs
to work, darling.
Why don't you play with Mabel?

28:02.816 --> 28:05.752
She refuses to hit the ball.
She says she feels sorry
for Ball-y.

28:05.785 --> 28:07.320
Ball-y.

28:07.354 --> 28:08.988
Darling, please go and play
cricket with Billy.

28:09.022 --> 28:10.957
I may not!

28:12.959 --> 28:14.260
[video game beeps continue]

28:19.132 --> 28:23.036
Is it too much to ask
to get some bloody peace all
by my bloody self

28:23.069 --> 28:24.971
for five bloody minutes?

28:25.005 --> 28:26.506
[Billy] Internet's down!

28:26.539 --> 28:28.308
[Mabel]
I want to watch SpongeBob.

28:28.341 --> 28:30.477
Tell Billy it's my turn.

28:30.510 --> 28:34.247
-[Billy] Mummy!
-I don't want to be a mummy
right now.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.949
[Billy] You had it for ages!

28:35.982 --> 28:38.485
[Mabel] I didn't even
have it today. It's my turn!

28:38.518 --> 28:40.086
-[Billy] Mummy!
-[Bridget screams]

28:40.120 --> 28:41.388
[Billy] There's no Internet!

28:41.421 --> 28:44.224
I just want to sit down

28:44.257 --> 28:48.862
in echoing silence on my own
for one moment.

28:48.895 --> 28:51.364
-[Billy] Mummy! Mummy!
-Just shut up!

28:51.398 --> 28:52.465
[clamouring stops]

28:58.938 --> 29:00.006
[music playing]

29:01.474 --> 29:03.243
[cartoon character 1]
Shark bait!

29:03.276 --> 29:04.477
Come and get it!

29:04.511 --> 29:06.246
-[Billy chuckles]
-[chuckles]

29:06.279 --> 29:07.814
[cartoon character 2]
Okay. You asked for it!

29:07.847 --> 29:09.082
Miranda?

29:09.115 --> 29:10.383
All right, Bridge?

29:10.417 --> 29:12.585
What're you doing here?

29:12.619 --> 29:15.855
So I was reading the newspaper
in Soho House

29:15.889 --> 29:20.126
and it was so, so quiet,
you know?

29:20.160 --> 29:22.529
I just miss all this.

29:22.562 --> 29:28.301
Off milk, stuff, clutter,
children, life.

29:28.335 --> 29:30.003
Plenty of that here.

29:30.036 --> 29:31.271
You don't have any champagne.

29:31.304 --> 29:33.139
Top tip:

29:33.173 --> 29:36.343
always keep a cold bottle
of champagne

29:36.376 --> 29:38.378
in the fridge for emergencies.

29:39.279 --> 29:41.214
That's excellent advice.

29:41.247 --> 29:42.449
Cards on the table,

29:42.482 --> 29:45.952
I'm thinking
of unfreezing my eggs.

29:45.985 --> 29:49.089
Apparently,
everyone is going to Denmark

29:49.122 --> 29:50.256
to get sperm.

29:50.290 --> 29:51.591
-Oh.
-Yeah.

29:51.624 --> 29:54.994
But I want what you have.
All of this.

29:55.028 --> 29:59.232
But Soho House and-and Sunday
papers and cold champagne--

29:59.265 --> 30:00.600
You're free, Bridge.

30:00.633 --> 30:03.903
You're liberated from
the tyranny of this.

30:03.937 --> 30:07.173
Do you know how many
dating apps I use?

30:07.207 --> 30:08.408
Could you look sexy?

30:08.441 --> 30:10.043
Well, I mean...

30:10.076 --> 30:13.446
I might still brush up OK
given enough time.

30:13.480 --> 30:14.914
No, I mean for this photo.

30:14.948 --> 30:16.049
[shutter clicks]

30:16.082 --> 30:17.250
I've set you up on Tinder.

30:17.283 --> 30:19.185
-What?
-You're welcome.

30:19.219 --> 30:21.454
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
-Well, I've popped you down as
a widow.

30:21.488 --> 30:23.456
It's so much more romantic
and singular.

30:23.490 --> 30:26.359
We all agree it's what you need.

30:26.393 --> 30:28.928
[Mabel] What's Tinder?

30:28.962 --> 30:30.196
It's...

30:30.230 --> 30:33.233
such a lovely day.

30:33.266 --> 30:36.936
Who wants to, um,
go to the heath?

30:36.970 --> 30:39.239
-No, I don't wanna go!
-No, SpongeBob!

30:39.272 --> 30:41.608
Oh, OK. That's no problem.

30:41.641 --> 30:43.109
Uh, sure.

30:43.143 --> 30:44.678
Um, you stay here,

30:44.711 --> 30:50.383
and I'll just, uh, take these
chocolate buttons. Ooh!

30:50.417 --> 30:53.620
-Let's go, nutters!
-Can't wait!

30:53.653 --> 30:56.089
Children and fresh air
and white chocolate buttons.

30:56.122 --> 30:58.591
-I feel like Julie Andrews!
-[phone beeps]

30:58.625 --> 31:00.493
Oh! I just got matched
with someone.

31:00.527 --> 31:02.228
Sorry, Mabel, could you just
get off, actually,

31:02.262 --> 31:03.563
'cause you're killing my back.

31:03.596 --> 31:07.467
Uh, he's on a street corner...
in a van.

31:09.736 --> 31:12.372
-He looks like Jason Statham...
-Mmm.

31:12.405 --> 31:14.174
...if you squint.

31:14.207 --> 31:15.508
In a bit, Bridge.

31:15.542 --> 31:17.110
Bye, kids. See you.

31:17.143 --> 31:18.645
-[both] Bye!
-Bye.

31:20.380 --> 31:21.481
[makes whooshing noise]

31:24.317 --> 31:28.688
[Bridget] Oh, how everything
calms down once you're outside
in blue skies

31:28.722 --> 31:32.392
turning the children into
biddable lemurs.

31:32.425 --> 31:36.496
Will obviously
delete Tinder immediately.

31:36.529 --> 31:38.698
But perhaps
a very quick look first.

31:44.704 --> 31:45.672
Keith?

31:46.573 --> 31:48.575
Who are you, Keith?

31:51.111 --> 31:55.415
[gasps] Feel suddenly exposed
to whole new world hiding
in plain sight

31:55.448 --> 31:57.350
like Narnia through back
of wardrobe,

31:57.384 --> 32:00.086
but with lion
and witch shagging.

32:00.120 --> 32:02.989
[Billy] Mummy!
Mabel's stuck up the tree!

32:03.023 --> 32:05.158
-How'd she get up there?
-[Mabel] Mummy!

32:05.191 --> 32:06.192
Coming!

32:07.460 --> 32:08.561
[gasps]

32:11.031 --> 32:11.698
Okay.

32:11.731 --> 32:14.134
No, it's... it's all right.

32:14.167 --> 32:17.137
-[Billy]
I can't get down either.
-It's all right. I'm here.

32:18.371 --> 32:19.439
Uh.

32:19.472 --> 32:21.441
[Walliker] Billy. Is that you?

32:21.474 --> 32:23.510
Oh, no. It's Mr Walliker.

32:23.543 --> 32:25.478
Everything all right, Mrs Darcy?

32:25.512 --> 32:28.381
[sighs] Yep. Super.

32:28.415 --> 32:30.050
Just climbing a tree.

32:30.083 --> 32:32.052
-I can see that.
-[Bridget chuckles]

32:32.085 --> 32:32.752
Having fun?

32:32.786 --> 32:35.221
Yes. Yeah, this is really fun.

32:35.255 --> 32:36.222
[breathes heavily]

32:37.824 --> 32:40.193
-You sure you don't need a hand?
-No, no.

32:40.226 --> 32:41.728
As Einstein said,

32:41.761 --> 32:45.231
"What goes up must come down."

32:45.265 --> 32:47.067
-Newton.
-Yes.

32:47.100 --> 32:49.202
Newton. [chuckles]

32:49.235 --> 32:50.570
We're going to die!

32:50.603 --> 32:53.206
No, we're not going to die.
We're having fun.

32:53.239 --> 32:55.475
[Bridget] We are definitely
going to die.

32:55.508 --> 32:57.777
Clearly you've got this
nicely in hand.

32:58.745 --> 33:00.714
Look, there's a policeman.

33:04.351 --> 33:05.685
[Bridget] Oh, my God.

33:05.719 --> 33:08.054
I've climbed
a magical man tree.

33:09.122 --> 33:10.290
-Are you stuck?
-[Mabel] Yes!

33:10.323 --> 33:12.092
No. [chuckles]

33:12.125 --> 33:14.527
-Do they need help?
-Apparently not.

33:16.262 --> 33:18.298
So, I'll... I'll be off then.

33:18.865 --> 33:20.066
Bye-bye.

33:23.370 --> 33:25.372
Okay. I'll be off too.

33:25.405 --> 33:27.540
Don't go away.

33:27.574 --> 33:29.642
[Bridget] No, seriously.
Don't go away.

33:29.676 --> 33:32.212
Hang on. I'm coming.

33:33.313 --> 33:34.414
[heath ranger] Okay. Coming up.

33:34.447 --> 33:36.216
[straining]

33:37.250 --> 33:38.284
Uh...

33:38.318 --> 33:40.120
Hello.

33:40.153 --> 33:42.055
[heath ranger]
Okay, just... Hang on.

33:43.156 --> 33:45.091
-[grunting]
-[Bridget strains]

33:47.227 --> 33:48.194
Hello.

33:48.228 --> 33:49.396
Hi, mate.

33:49.429 --> 33:50.697
-Hi, what's your name?
-Mabel.

33:50.730 --> 33:52.866
-Mabel.
-I can't jump down.

33:52.899 --> 33:53.833
[Mabel chuckles]

33:53.867 --> 33:56.302
Okay. Well, you sit down there.

33:56.336 --> 33:59.172
You get comfy, and I'm gonna go
down there and catch you, OK?

34:00.840 --> 34:02.409
-Okay, you ready?
-Yeah.

34:02.442 --> 34:04.310
Three, two, one, go!

34:04.344 --> 34:07.280
-[Mabel] I did it!
-[heath ranger] I've got you.
Well done.

34:07.313 --> 34:08.848
All right, big man. Your turn.

34:08.882 --> 34:11.751
Okay. You got this, mate.
There we go.

34:11.784 --> 34:13.152
-Next foot.
-[Bridget] That's it, darling.

34:13.186 --> 34:15.422
[heath ranger] And I've got you.
[grunts]

34:15.455 --> 34:17.223
Okay, Mum.

34:17.257 --> 34:18.525
-Okay.
-[squeals]

34:18.558 --> 34:19.659
There we go. [chuckles]

34:19.693 --> 34:21.293
-Okay.
-Okay.

34:21.327 --> 34:22.295
-[chuckles]
-[grunts]

34:23.563 --> 34:25.197
-You all right?
-[chuckling] Yes.

34:26.199 --> 34:27.600
Yes. [chuckles]

34:28.368 --> 34:29.601
Okay.

34:30.603 --> 34:31.603
Thank you.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.175
Thank you.

34:35.208 --> 34:35.875
It's all right.

34:37.677 --> 34:40.313
Uh, I'm Roxby.
But you can call me Roxster.

34:41.414 --> 34:42.514
Bridget Jones.

34:42.549 --> 34:44.284
But you can call her Mummy.

34:44.317 --> 34:46.353
Hmm. Okay.

34:47.219 --> 34:48.188
[Roxster] Oh.

34:49.755 --> 34:50.857
I think this is yours.

34:53.493 --> 34:54.627
Thanks.

34:56.529 --> 34:57.864
Anything else I can help with?

34:57.897 --> 34:59.332
[Bridget] God, yes.

34:59.366 --> 35:00.367
No.

35:01.401 --> 35:02.802
Okay.

35:02.836 --> 35:05.205
It's nice to meet you, Roxy.
[chuckles]

35:05.772 --> 35:06.906
It's Roxster.

35:07.640 --> 35:09.342
[both chuckle]

35:09.376 --> 35:11.911
You too, Bridget Jones.

35:18.385 --> 35:21.254
[Bridget] Now obsessed
with tree-rescuing Adonis

35:21.287 --> 35:25.592
and reentering world
of flirting simultaneously
with workforce.

35:25.625 --> 35:28.561
-Mrs Darcy.
-Mr Walliker.

35:28.595 --> 35:32.365
Weapon at the ready, I see.
[chuckles]

35:32.399 --> 35:35.669
Good to see you managed
to extricate yourself from
that tree.

35:35.702 --> 35:38.238
Oh, yes.
It's the children's
favourite game.

35:38.271 --> 35:42.342
We're completely obsessed
with the outdoors in our house.
[chuckles]

35:42.375 --> 35:45.311
Well, I'll have to put you down
for our Outward Bound trip
next term.

35:45.345 --> 35:46.780
Sounds like it'd be right up
your street.

35:46.813 --> 35:48.448
[Bridget] Fucking fuck.

35:48.481 --> 35:50.517
Yeah. Good.

35:50.550 --> 35:53.353
Do you have my slime?
I promised I'd show Cosmata.

35:55.355 --> 35:56.456
Oh.

35:58.992 --> 36:00.360
[Mabel] Hey, those are mine.

36:00.393 --> 36:01.795
Give them to me.

36:02.796 --> 36:03.930
[Mabel strains]

36:03.963 --> 36:07.400
They are actually hers.

36:07.434 --> 36:08.468
Well, in that case...

36:11.838 --> 36:12.906
[bell rings]

36:12.939 --> 36:14.708
[Perfect Nicolette] Bridget!

36:14.741 --> 36:16.443
You're dressed properly.

36:17.277 --> 36:18.545
Odd.

36:18.578 --> 36:20.413
Heading to a meeting.

36:20.447 --> 36:22.816
Thinking about going back to
my old job.

36:22.849 --> 36:25.885
Oh, a job. Oh, I'll put you down
for Jobs Day then.

36:25.919 --> 36:27.687
[Bridget]
Fucking fuckety fuck fuck.

36:27.721 --> 36:30.023
Yes, absolutely.

36:30.056 --> 36:32.959
[speaking French] Celestine,
merci. C'est gentil.

36:32.992 --> 36:35.428
Actually, do you mind
tidying this up a little bit?

36:35.462 --> 36:36.930
Sure.

36:36.963 --> 36:38.698
Uh, what about the children?
Do you have a nanny?

36:38.732 --> 36:40.033
Not yet.

36:40.066 --> 36:42.769
Oh, I've got the perfect person.
She's excellent.

36:42.802 --> 36:44.838
She's very pretty, but that
doesn't matter, Bridget,

36:44.871 --> 36:46.906
because you don't have
a husband,

36:46.940 --> 36:49.843
so it's absolutely immaterial
how pretty and perfect she is.
[chuckles]

36:49.876 --> 36:51.978
-Sounds good.
-There we go.

36:52.012 --> 36:54.414
-Francesca.
-Sorry.

36:54.447 --> 36:55.749
Wonderful.

36:55.782 --> 36:57.851
It's nothing.
I just threw it together.

36:57.884 --> 36:59.386
-Ah.
-[kisses]

36:59.419 --> 37:01.354
Bridget? Your donation?

37:01.888 --> 37:03.423
You didn't forget?

37:03.456 --> 37:05.925
No. [chuckles]

37:05.959 --> 37:08.862
Certainly not. [chuckles]

37:08.895 --> 37:11.865
Uh, let's see.

37:11.898 --> 37:13.333
Here we are.

37:14.834 --> 37:16.536
Hummus.

37:16.569 --> 37:18.004
And, uh...

37:23.643 --> 37:25.745
[Perfect Nicolette] Rice cakes.

37:25.779 --> 37:29.616
And look, they've even been
opened already.

37:29.649 --> 37:30.917
[chuckles]

37:30.950 --> 37:33.019
-Lovely.
-[phone beeps]

37:33.053 --> 37:36.656
Ah. Her name's Chloe,
and she'll be with you at 6:30.

37:36.690 --> 37:37.724
[whistle blows]

37:37.757 --> 37:39.492
Raef! India! Get inside.

37:39.526 --> 37:40.927
That's enough chatting.

37:42.796 --> 37:44.064
Bridget Jones.

37:44.864 --> 37:46.066
Thank you.

38:17.831 --> 38:19.366
Four.

38:19.399 --> 38:20.100
[elevator] Four.

38:34.714 --> 38:37.717
-Three.
-[elevator] Three.

38:37.751 --> 38:39.652
Thank you.

38:41.821 --> 38:43.490
[Bridget] This is Bridget Jones
about to

38:43.523 --> 38:47.027
go into an actual
in-person meeting.

38:48.995 --> 38:51.498
-Brenda Jones?
-Oh, actually, it's--

38:51.531 --> 38:54.167
Bridget Jones, there you are.
Excellent. Quick, come with me.

38:54.200 --> 38:56.436
-Thank you, Lizzie.
-Thanks.

38:57.837 --> 38:59.873
Good to see ya.
How have you been?

39:01.007 --> 39:02.809
You look hot.

39:02.842 --> 39:05.111
Oh. Thank you, Richard.
[chuckles]

39:05.145 --> 39:08.481
But I think you'll find
that sort of language is
a little outmoded

39:08.515 --> 39:10.750
-in the workplace.
-No, I mean flustered.

39:10.784 --> 39:12.485
Are you going through the, uh,
you know?

39:14.988 --> 39:18.124
Bridget, let me introduce you
to Talitha.

39:18.158 --> 39:21.761
[Talitha] Richard, what am I
supposed to do with this, huh?

39:21.795 --> 39:23.596
Does it climb?
Does it stand on one leg?

39:23.630 --> 39:26.132
Does it do cartwheels?
It's a tortoise.
It doesn't do anything.

39:26.166 --> 39:28.635
[producer] He can't pull out.
Who the fuck does
he think he is?

39:28.668 --> 39:30.670
Arrogant, self-important prick.

39:30.704 --> 39:33.907
Tell that selfish arsehole
he can rot in hell.

39:33.940 --> 39:35.809
The Dalai Lama's cancelled.

39:35.842 --> 39:37.877
Twat. Shit.

39:37.911 --> 39:40.980
Okay, we've got an hour
till we're on air.

39:41.014 --> 39:42.749
We need a replacement.
Let me make a call.

39:42.782 --> 39:44.050
I do Krav Maga with Fergie.

39:44.084 --> 39:45.819
Duchess or Black Eyed Pea?

39:45.852 --> 39:47.887
Duchess. She could be here
in 45.

39:47.921 --> 39:51.725
Talitha, meet Bridget Jones.
Best producer we've ever had.

39:51.758 --> 39:52.859
[Bridget] Oh.

39:52.892 --> 39:54.594
I'm sure you're very good too.

39:54.627 --> 39:55.762
Huge fan.

39:55.795 --> 39:56.996
Hold this.

39:57.030 --> 39:58.898
Loved your early work
from Chechnya.

39:58.932 --> 40:02.502
[chuckles]
Now I'm doing features
on incontinent tortoises.

40:02.535 --> 40:03.770
Fergie.

40:03.803 --> 40:05.572
Are those glutes burning up?

40:05.605 --> 40:06.172
Hello.

40:06.206 --> 40:08.608
-Hey. Sorry.
-Right.

40:08.641 --> 40:12.012
Uh, right. Let's get rid
of this set, please, now!

40:12.045 --> 40:14.014
So, what do you think?

40:14.047 --> 40:15.782
Can we lure you back?

40:15.815 --> 40:17.784
[Talitha] Fergie's in.

40:17.817 --> 40:21.054
Does anyone know how
to get tortoise piss out
of silk?

40:21.087 --> 40:23.656
Blotting and mild detergent.

40:24.657 --> 40:25.992
When can I start?

40:28.294 --> 40:31.097
[Bridget] Am rejoining ranks
of London's employed

40:31.131 --> 40:34.801
and meaningfully contributing
to society.

40:34.834 --> 40:39.673
Can walk with head held high
and be role model
for Billy and Mabel,

40:39.706 --> 40:44.244
saving them from otherwise
certain future as alcoholic
wards of the state.

40:46.613 --> 40:49.616
[Pamela] It's super that
the television's invited
you back.

40:49.649 --> 40:52.052
Of course, I always stayed
at home when you were little.

40:52.085 --> 40:53.019
[Bridget] Classic Mum.

40:53.053 --> 40:54.688
Can't really talk, Mum.

40:54.721 --> 40:56.856
I've got to tidy up
before the nanny gets here.

40:56.890 --> 40:58.224
A nanny? Really?

40:58.258 --> 41:01.861
Mummy doesn't love us anymore.
Ow!

41:01.895 --> 41:04.731
[Bridget] Ever since Mum
and Una moved
into Audsley House,

41:04.764 --> 41:07.267
the retirement home
we have to pretend is a hotel,

41:07.300 --> 41:09.102
the phone calls
have been the same.

41:09.135 --> 41:11.771
[Una] Any men on the horizon,
Bridget?

41:11.805 --> 41:14.874
Well, there's got to
be someone. Some people
don't mind a widow.

41:14.908 --> 41:16.576
[Bridget] Stings a bit.

41:16.609 --> 41:18.578
[Pamela] Beggars can't
be choosers, Bridget.

41:18.611 --> 41:21.614
And now, look, we're in
the hotel kitchen

41:21.648 --> 41:24.284
-doing salmon in the sous vide.
-[phone beeps]

41:24.317 --> 41:26.619
I mean, it's basically
boil-in-the-bag,

41:26.653 --> 41:28.988
but everybody's doing it
these days.

41:29.022 --> 41:31.591
[Bridget] Roxster.
Definite development.

41:31.624 --> 41:33.126
[Mum] Cooking's never really
been your thing.

41:33.159 --> 41:35.762
-[doorbell rings]
-Oh, must go. Bye, Mum!

41:35.795 --> 41:36.796
[Pamela] Bye, bye.

41:36.830 --> 41:38.198
Oh, God, it's her.

41:40.967 --> 41:42.569
Hi, I'm Chloe.

41:43.703 --> 41:44.671
Hello.

41:46.172 --> 41:47.974
[Bridget] What the actual fuck?

41:48.008 --> 41:50.643
She looks like a film star.

41:50.677 --> 41:52.145
Chloe, this is Mabel.

41:52.178 --> 41:54.914
Look, I can play the recorder
with my nose.

41:54.948 --> 41:56.683
[plays recorder]

41:56.716 --> 41:59.019
Children, this is Chloe.

41:59.052 --> 42:01.021
She's going to come
and help with everything.

42:01.054 --> 42:02.889
Nicolette mentioned it would
be a challenge,

42:02.922 --> 42:05.025
-but I've certainly seen worse.
-Oh.

42:05.058 --> 42:07.994
Oh, and this is Billy,
the science genius.

42:08.028 --> 42:11.898
Ooh, we mustn't
pigeonhole children.
It adds undue pressure.

42:11.931 --> 42:14.000
Have you read How To Raise
a Self-Driven Child?

42:14.034 --> 42:15.635
Oh, yes. It's-It's on my list,

42:15.669 --> 42:18.972
so do not spoil the ending.
[chuckles]

42:19.005 --> 42:20.740
Oh, not to worry, Billy.

42:20.774 --> 42:22.676
It's not about the result.
It's about the journey.

42:22.709 --> 42:24.978
There's something to learn
whether you get an A or a C.

42:25.011 --> 42:28.314
[chuckles] Billy has never had
a C in...

42:29.416 --> 42:30.116
Who did this?

42:30.150 --> 42:32.185
Mr Walliker.

42:32.218 --> 42:35.722
I drew the earth
and the atmosphere,
and I put heaven over the top.

42:35.755 --> 42:38.892
And Mr Walliker said that heaven
was a religious construct.

42:38.925 --> 42:40.193
And he gave me a C.

42:40.226 --> 42:42.228
[gasps] Well, Mr Walliker

42:42.262 --> 42:44.998
is a whistle-obsessed fascist

42:45.031 --> 42:48.234
with all the soul of
a non-stick wok.

42:48.268 --> 42:50.670
[Mabel] Where did you hide
the chocolate digestives?

42:50.704 --> 42:53.239
-I didn't hide...
-[crashing]

42:54.841 --> 42:55.875
...anything.

42:55.909 --> 42:57.243
[dishes crash]

42:57.277 --> 43:00.180
Well, plenty to do here.

43:00.213 --> 43:02.015
["Worth It" playing]

43:02.048 --> 43:04.684
* If my body was a boat
Could you steer that, sailor? *

43:04.718 --> 43:08.088
* Make it feel
Like it's a 1960s
Hollywood trailer...*

43:08.121 --> 43:11.825
[Bridget] Consumed with guilt
re hideously perfect nanny,

43:11.858 --> 43:14.327
who children will obviously
come to love more than
hopeless mother

43:14.361 --> 43:16.262
-without film star hair.
-[phone beeps]

43:16.296 --> 43:18.965
* Ooh, it's what I need
Yes, 'cause*

* I could love you*

* If I really wanted to*

-* Would you make it

43:39.953 --> 43:41.287
* Or maybe that much better?*

43:41.321 --> 43:42.989
* If you wanted
You could make it*

43:43.023 --> 43:45.125

* So I hope you're gonna make it
All worth it, worth it...*

43:53.033 --> 43:56.403
[Bridget] And texting Roxster
slowly became part of my life.

43:56.436 --> 44:00.473
A relationship
with no necessity
for actually meeting,

44:00.507 --> 44:04.811
or arrangements, or sex,
or any real life at all.

44:04.844 --> 44:08.982
- In other words,
the perfect relationship.
-[phone beeps]

44:09.015 --> 44:11.317
Is that the tree Adonis?

44:12.152 --> 44:14.387
Wait a minute.

44:14.421 --> 44:17.824
You wrote to him,
"How are you liking Tinder?"

44:17.857 --> 44:20.293
Inoffensive, neutral,
a bit dull.

44:20.326 --> 44:24.197
He replied, "Don't know,
only joined it to find you,
Bridget Jones."

44:25.265 --> 44:27.400
-Shag him now.
-Mm-mmm.

44:27.434 --> 44:30.270
Then he sent a smiley emoji

44:30.303 --> 44:34.207
and then you responded
with the flag of Greece,

44:34.240 --> 44:37.944
an abacus and a duck.

44:41.014 --> 44:42.115
I panicked.

44:42.148 --> 44:43.383
[customer] Thank you.

44:43.416 --> 44:45.318
[checkout operator] Who's next?

44:45.352 --> 44:48.088
Do you want to go for a drink?

44:48.121 --> 44:50.323
I'm so flattered.

44:50.357 --> 44:52.859
Um, but I've got a boyfriend.

44:52.892 --> 44:56.796
Well, sort of got a boyfriend.
I think.

44:56.830 --> 45:00.033
Um, so nice of you to ask,
but, um...

45:01.368 --> 45:03.370
no, thank you.

45:03.403 --> 45:05.805
No, it's part of the meal deal.

45:08.041 --> 45:09.175
[Miranda chuckles]

45:09.209 --> 45:10.310
[Talitha] Well, this one's easy.

45:10.343 --> 45:13.113
You absolutely must go.
Obviously.

45:13.146 --> 45:16.516
But we've been texting for so
long now. I can't meet him.

45:16.549 --> 45:18.451
I mean, maybe it's like
in Jane Austen's day

45:18.485 --> 45:20.286
when they did letter writing
for months and months

45:20.320 --> 45:21.955
and then suddenly
just got married.

45:21.988 --> 45:25.191
Bridget, sexting a man
that you just met in a park

45:25.225 --> 45:26.960
is nothing like
Jane Austen's day.

45:26.993 --> 45:29.829
-If you don't shag him, I will.
-I can't.

45:29.863 --> 45:33.199
There is no possibility
of being naked with a man
at this point in my life.

45:33.233 --> 45:35.402
You just need a little rebrand.

45:35.435 --> 45:37.103
You'll start by getting a slip.

45:37.137 --> 45:38.905
-A slip?
-Yeah, with a slip,

45:38.938 --> 45:41.374
you can show off your arms,
your legs, your dÃ©colletage,

45:41.408 --> 45:43.043
which are always the last to go.

45:43.076 --> 45:44.511
And keep the central area,

45:44.544 --> 45:47.414
which one might want to gloss
over, glossed over.

45:47.447 --> 45:48.982
And get a Brazilian.

45:49.015 --> 45:50.450
God, no.

45:50.483 --> 45:52.218
I like a bit
of coverage down there.

45:52.252 --> 45:54.120
Or run a comb through it
at least.

45:54.154 --> 45:56.222
But also, do get a Brazilian.

45:56.256 --> 45:58.024
Just dust it. Dust it down.

45:58.992 --> 46:00.460
Okay, I'll go!

46:00.493 --> 46:03.296
But I'm not going to sleep
with him.

46:04.931 --> 46:07.100
[Bridget] Are condoms
meant to be coloured?

46:07.133 --> 46:09.102
Is hypersensitive good?

46:09.135 --> 46:11.471
Large? Small? Oh.

46:11.504 --> 46:14.908
Maybe just purchase
a representative selection.

46:23.249 --> 46:24.317
-[till beeps]
-Regular.

46:26.086 --> 46:27.420
Mmm, exotic flavours.

46:27.454 --> 46:28.555
[till beeps]

46:30.123 --> 46:31.224
Thin feel.

46:31.257 --> 46:32.359
[till beeps]

46:33.426 --> 46:34.894
-Extra-large.
-[till beeps]

46:36.296 --> 46:37.597
-[till beeps]
-Pleasure Me.

46:39.499 --> 46:41.401
-[till beeps]
-Lube.

46:42.602 --> 46:44.337
-[till beeps]
-Pleasure Me again.

46:54.080 --> 46:56.016
Enjoy your weekend, Mrs Darcy.

47:05.058 --> 47:06.960
Hello, old friend.

47:15.135 --> 47:16.102
Hmm.

47:17.637 --> 47:18.938
[Bridget] Thanks for having
the kids tonight.

47:18.972 --> 47:20.440
Always a pleasure,
never a chore.

47:20.473 --> 47:21.908
I'll take them to
school in the morning.

47:21.941 --> 47:25.912
So you can stay out as late
as you want.

47:25.945 --> 47:28.048
Make up for four years of
no shagging.

47:28.081 --> 47:29.449
It's only a drink.

47:32.185 --> 47:33.987
Too see-through?

47:34.020 --> 47:36.222
Mmm. Definitely.

47:36.256 --> 47:37.457
[Bridget sighs] OK.

47:38.992 --> 47:40.093
How about this?

47:42.228 --> 47:44.230
-[blows kiss]
-OK.

47:44.264 --> 47:46.499
[Bridget] The reality suddenly
completely terrifying,

47:46.533 --> 47:48.335
and Mark,
and insane and flabby.

47:48.368 --> 47:49.602
And oh, God, oh, God.

47:49.636 --> 47:50.970
I can't.

47:51.004 --> 47:52.972
-I really can't.
-Oh. What? What?

47:53.006 --> 47:56.009
-No, I just can't.
-Aw. Hey, you can.

47:56.042 --> 48:00.080
You just need to think of
it as widening your circle
of friends.

48:00.113 --> 48:01.181
That's all.

48:02.215 --> 48:03.950
[Shazzer] Hmm?

48:03.983 --> 48:05.251
Come on.

48:05.285 --> 48:07.354
Put on the dress,
get out of here

48:07.387 --> 48:09.589
and widen your fucking circle.

48:28.708 --> 48:30.610
[Bridget] Oh, God. Look at him.

48:30.643 --> 48:32.612
What if he's perfect?

48:42.188 --> 48:43.156
-Hello.
-[chuckles]

48:43.189 --> 48:44.124
Hi.

48:46.292 --> 48:50.163
There's a really great place
around here that's been here
for forever.

48:50.196 --> 48:51.564
Do you know this area at all?

48:51.598 --> 48:54.567
Mmm, I used to.

48:54.601 --> 48:58.171
Yeah, the, uh, Heath Ranger
thing is just a day job.

48:58.204 --> 49:01.007
-And my real passion is garbage.
-[chuckles]

49:03.243 --> 49:04.444
Really?

49:04.477 --> 49:08.014
The technical term
is garbologist.

49:08.048 --> 49:11.384
I'm a biochemist.
Studying to be one.

49:11.418 --> 49:13.119
You're a student.

49:13.153 --> 49:15.355
A late-in-life one, anyway.
Yeah.

49:15.388 --> 49:17.323
How late?

49:17.357 --> 49:18.558
I'm 28.

49:19.526 --> 49:21.127
I'm just kidding.

49:21.161 --> 49:22.495
I'm 29.

49:23.029 --> 49:24.631
[Bridget] Fuck.

49:24.664 --> 49:27.300
Is he closer in age to me
or to Billy?

49:27.334 --> 49:28.568
What about you?

49:29.836 --> 49:31.237
You are...

49:31.271 --> 49:33.340
Slightly older.

49:33.373 --> 49:36.476
I'm gonna say 35-ish.

49:36.509 --> 49:38.078
Yes.

49:38.111 --> 49:39.112
Bull's-eye.

49:40.246 --> 49:41.648
Let's say 35.

49:41.681 --> 49:43.149
-Mmm. Thirty-five it is.
-Mm-hmm.

49:45.118 --> 49:46.619
Is 35 all right?

49:46.653 --> 49:48.555
I think older women,

49:48.588 --> 49:51.324
ever so slightly older women,

49:52.559 --> 49:54.094
have a wiser view on life.

49:54.127 --> 49:56.363
You know,
they're more experienced

49:56.396 --> 49:59.666
and more emotionally mature.

49:59.699 --> 50:01.534
[Bridget] Me in a nutshell.

50:01.568 --> 50:04.537
I find that very attractive.

50:27.327 --> 50:31.231
[Bridget] Oh, God.
I have no idea how any
of this works anymore.

50:32.732 --> 50:34.601
Is it all right if I kiss you?

50:37.704 --> 50:40.807
[Bridget] Aw.
The generation who ask.

50:40.840 --> 50:43.176
I think
that would be acceptable.

51:27.654 --> 51:29.289
[breathing heavily]

51:34.461 --> 51:36.596
Give me just one moment.

51:36.629 --> 51:37.664
[chuckles]

51:47.640 --> 51:49.642
Oh, my God.

51:51.244 --> 51:52.846
What are you doing?

Yeah. Okay.

-Morning.

54:26.066 --> 54:27.701
I've got coffee
and I've got Ricky Gervais's

54:27.734 --> 54:29.736
requests for today's show.

54:29.769 --> 54:31.805
-Seriously? [gasps]
-Yeah.

-It's big.
-Yeah.

-Uh-huh.

54:36.042 --> 54:38.378

54:38.411 --> 54:41.448
And he'll only use La Mer
for some reason?

54:41.481 --> 54:42.916

-Ooh. Three, please.
-[elevator] Three.

What? No.

* Won't you take a hold of me*

54:51.091 --> 54:53.626
Sam! Ricky Gervais is
on his way in.

54:53.660 --> 54:56.529
And, apparently, he won't drink
Evian, only Icelandic water.

54:56.563 --> 54:58.832
And it's got to have lots
of alkalines.

54:59.766 --> 55:01.001
Or no alkalines.

Um...

I did.

I had a full night
of utterly mind-blowing sex

with a tree-rescuing rubbish
expert Adonis who might
be slightly younger, probably.

55:36.803 --> 55:40.707
And it was amazing!

Okay?

So take that, Chloe.

and cheese, but with butternut
squash instead.

Just needs to move to the top
in about 20 minutes.

56:16.009 --> 56:18.144
Good. Good. Right.

56:18.178 --> 56:20.580
It's just how I would do it.

56:20.613 --> 56:22.048
Um... Oh, Chloe,

56:22.082 --> 56:24.217
uh, it would be really helpful

56:24.250 --> 56:26.619
to have their water bottles done
the night before.

56:26.653 --> 56:28.154
In the fridge. Top right.

for snack tomorrow.

-Cricket, yeah.

56:38.665 --> 56:40.767
In a snack bag. Labelled.
By the bread bin.

56:40.800 --> 56:43.536
-We have a bread bin?
-I have to leave, I'm afraid.

Graham and I have tai chi
on Thursdays.

56:45.572 --> 56:48.008

to get the spot you want.

Oh. [chuckles] 'Course.

You and Graham enjoy
your tai chi.

56:52.679 --> 56:55.181
Oh, you forgot to leave out
Billy's cricket things,

it wasn't just one night.

57:46.700 --> 57:50.103
[Bridget] And the night
turned into a summer.

57:50.136 --> 57:51.971
[Bridget, Roxster chuckling]

57:52.005 --> 57:55.208
* I can see
You standing there now*

57:56.943 --> 57:58.978
* And you're
The prettiest thing*

57:59.012 --> 58:01.047
* In the crowd*

58:02.682 --> 58:09.222
* And guess who
Be laughing loud, but me*

58:10.790 --> 58:15.028
* You made me see the love*

58:16.062 --> 58:19.866
* That you're giving me*

58:19.899 --> 58:21.801
* Baby...*

58:21.835 --> 58:23.003
[laughing]

58:23.036 --> 58:25.305
* Won't you hold my hand?*

58:26.439 --> 58:31.077
* Just let me know that
I'm your man*

58:31.111 --> 58:34.948
* And show I'm not ashamed*

58:34.981 --> 58:37.717
* I walk the floor*

58:37.751 --> 58:41.888
* When you leave me*

58:41.921 --> 58:43.156
[whooping]

58:43.189 --> 58:45.325
* Hey, baby*

58:46.793 --> 58:49.329
* I don't know about you*

58:51.264 --> 58:55.201
* Let me tell you what
I'm gonna do*

58:56.403 --> 59:01.741
* I'm gonna try to make
My dreams come true*

59:01.775 --> 59:04.244
* With you*

59:04.277 --> 59:05.912
Morning. Welcome back.

59:05.945 --> 59:08.081
-Good morning, Mr Walliker.
-Morning.

59:08.114 --> 59:09.916
-Morning.
-Mrs Darcy.

59:09.949 --> 59:10.984
How were
your summer holidays?

59:11.017 --> 59:12.152
I have a new daddy now.

59:12.185 --> 59:13.319
His name is Roxster,

59:13.353 --> 59:15.021
and he always gives Mummy

59:15.055 --> 59:16.690
a funny hairstyle in
the morning.

59:16.723 --> 59:18.825
Yes, well.
It's not that funny,
is it, Mabel?

59:18.858 --> 59:20.326
It is.

59:20.360 --> 59:23.263
He's not a new daddy.
He's just someone.

59:25.231 --> 59:26.266
Off you go.

59:28.101 --> 59:29.869
Well, it seems congratulations
are in order.

59:31.771 --> 59:33.206
[blows whistle]
You!

59:33.239 --> 59:35.375
-No. You two. Come on.
-Bye, Mum. See you soon. Bye.

59:35.408 --> 59:37.077
[in French]
Bisous, bisous, bisous.

59:37.110 --> 59:39.846
Bridget, I emailed you
from Anguilla about, um--

59:39.879 --> 59:42.849
Jobs Day, yes. I come prepared.

59:42.882 --> 59:47.287
I must say,
it's a welcome change,
all... this. [chuckles]

59:48.221 --> 59:49.656
Thank you. [chuckles]

59:51.925 --> 59:53.226
[chattering]

59:53.259 --> 59:55.228
[Walliker] All right, everyone.
Settle down.

59:55.261 --> 59:57.097
Settle down. Thank you.

59:57.130 --> 59:58.832
Um, so...

59:58.865 --> 01:00:02.168
Last term, Daveed's dad
was kind enough to talk to us

01:00:02.202 --> 01:00:04.037
about being a thoracic surgeon,

01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:06.339
and next week,
Eugenie's mum will be in

01:00:06.373 --> 01:00:09.209
to talk about her role
as a nuclear physicist,

01:00:09.242 --> 01:00:11.444
and how it felt to win
the Nobel Prize.

01:00:11.478 --> 01:00:14.814
But today, it's Billy's mum.

01:00:14.848 --> 01:00:17.917
So, everyone, give a warm
welcome to Mrs Darcy.

01:00:17.951 --> 01:00:19.152
[applause]

01:00:22.822 --> 01:00:23.790
Hello.

01:00:26.826 --> 01:00:28.161
Um. [clears throat]

01:00:28.194 --> 01:00:31.765
I am a television producer.

01:00:31.798 --> 01:00:35.869
My mum says television
is making society rot.

01:00:35.902 --> 01:00:37.437
Yes. Well, thank you, Priscilla.

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:40.807
[Bridget] OK.
May we have a volunteer?

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:41.808
[sneezes]

01:00:41.841 --> 01:00:43.710
Thank you, Esmeralda.

01:00:51.484 --> 01:00:52.752
Right.

01:00:52.786 --> 01:00:55.955
You can stand here.

01:00:55.989 --> 01:00:57.190
Very good.

01:00:57.223 --> 01:01:00.026
And you are going to
say things like,

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:02.295
"Ten seconds to air!"

01:01:02.328 --> 01:01:06.466
And I am going to be
the interviewer for the day.

01:01:07.834 --> 01:01:08.968
Now...

01:01:09.002 --> 01:01:10.437
[Bridget grunts]

01:01:12.872 --> 01:01:13.840
Just...

01:01:15.342 --> 01:01:18.745
[sighs] Right. OK.

01:01:18.778 --> 01:01:23.416
Perhaps Mr Walliker could be
the person being interviewed.

01:01:24.918 --> 01:01:25.952
Take a seat.

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.922
Uh, righto.

01:01:28.955 --> 01:01:30.824
Now, topic.

01:01:32.959 --> 01:01:36.262
-The life cycle of
the fruit fly. Hmm?
-[chuckles]

01:01:36.296 --> 01:01:37.497
Right, OK.

01:01:39.499 --> 01:01:42.736
Ooh. Ten seconds to air!

01:01:44.104 --> 01:01:45.939
Hello, this is Bridget Jones,

01:01:45.972 --> 01:01:49.776
and I'm delighted to have
Mr Walliker on the show today

01:01:49.809 --> 01:01:53.880
to help us understand
the life cycle of the fruit fly.

01:01:53.913 --> 01:01:55.448
Um, well, it's a...

01:01:55.482 --> 01:01:57.217
it's a pleasure to be on
the show.

01:01:57.250 --> 01:01:59.986
And, um, thank you
for that question.

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:01.287
Um... [smacks lips]

01:02:01.321 --> 01:02:03.223
Well, the, uh, the average...

01:02:03.256 --> 01:02:04.924
[stammers]

01:02:04.958 --> 01:02:06.092
Thank you.

01:02:06.126 --> 01:02:08.061
Uh, the average fly takes about

01:02:08.094 --> 01:02:09.362
two weeks to mature

01:02:09.396 --> 01:02:13.099
and can live for as long
as 40 or 50 days.

01:02:13.133 --> 01:02:16.836
And then,
like all living things,
when it dies, it simply stops.

01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:18.004
Cellular shutdown.

01:02:18.038 --> 01:02:20.173
It falls, gradually decomposes,

01:02:20.206 --> 01:02:22.208
and becomes part of
the soil system.

01:02:22.242 --> 01:02:24.277
But does it really end when
it dies?

01:02:26.212 --> 01:02:28.314
Exactly, Mr Walliker.

01:02:28.348 --> 01:02:31.051
Surely there's more to
the story.

01:02:32.419 --> 01:02:36.456
Um, well. Well, not really.

01:02:37.323 --> 01:02:39.492
But, yes. [chuckles]

01:02:39.526 --> 01:02:44.364
After the body of the fruit fly
stops working,

01:02:44.397 --> 01:02:47.267
uh, then the soul of
the fruit fly

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:50.236
will be able to be free, yes?

01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:52.405
And that particular fruit fly

01:02:52.439 --> 01:02:56.376
will always, in some senses,
be with us.

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:03.149
-The soul of the fruit fly?
-Hmm.

01:03:03.183 --> 01:03:04.617
There's no evidence for a soul,

01:03:04.651 --> 01:03:08.955
but the body is a perfect system
of electrical pulses,

01:03:08.988 --> 01:03:11.524
powered by the heart,
which is in itself

01:03:11.558 --> 01:03:14.494
-a pump, if you will--
-The soul, Mr Walliker,

01:03:14.527 --> 01:03:17.464
is the essence
of every living thing.

01:03:17.497 --> 01:03:19.899
If you think
we're simply bits of machinery

01:03:19.933 --> 01:03:21.468
that can be switched on or off,

01:03:21.501 --> 01:03:23.336
then where does art come from?

01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:26.139
Or-Or wonder? Or poetry?

01:03:26.172 --> 01:03:27.540
-Or magic?
-Magic?

01:03:27.574 --> 01:03:29.342
The fruit fly, when it dies,

01:03:29.376 --> 01:03:32.278
will stay with its fruit fly
family forever.

01:03:32.312 --> 01:03:34.981
Keep the interview on point,
Bridget.

01:03:35.015 --> 01:03:36.649
[Walliker]
This is utter nonsense.

01:03:36.683 --> 01:03:40.487
Our world is governed
by laws and fact.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.288
That's our universe.

01:03:42.322 --> 01:03:44.190
-And it is rational.
-Cut!

01:03:44.224 --> 01:03:46.192
I'm a realist, Mrs Darcy.

01:03:46.226 --> 01:03:48.128
I believe in what's real.

01:03:48.161 --> 01:03:49.396
Cut!

01:03:50.563 --> 01:03:52.932
[Bridget]
Off to Talitha's birthday.

01:03:52.966 --> 01:03:55.468
Are you sure you're OK
to stay tonight?

01:03:55.502 --> 01:03:58.471
It's Thursday.
I thought you
and Graham had tai chi.

01:03:58.505 --> 01:04:01.141
Won't kill him to miss a week,
will it?

01:04:01.174 --> 01:04:02.942
He's so uptight.

01:04:04.577 --> 01:04:06.946
Oh, you look nice, Bridget.

01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:08.481
Oh! [chuckles]

01:04:08.515 --> 01:04:10.650
Ooh. [chuckling]

01:04:11.985 --> 01:04:12.919
Oh, try this.

01:04:19.959 --> 01:04:21.227
There.

01:04:21.261 --> 01:04:22.595
Thanks, Chloe.

01:04:25.331 --> 01:04:28.068
Billy! Mabes!
Snacks on the table.

01:04:32.272 --> 01:04:35.508
So where is he?
Is he not coming?

01:04:35.542 --> 01:04:38.244
Oh, it's fine.
He must have been held up.

01:04:38.278 --> 01:04:40.980
-What? By some sort
of rubbish emergency?
-Oh.

01:04:41.014 --> 01:04:43.016
-Probably had to finish
his homework.
-[Tom] Stop it.

01:04:43.049 --> 01:04:44.517
Hope he gets here
before story time.

01:04:44.551 --> 01:04:46.386
[Bridget] Shut it!

01:04:46.419 --> 01:04:48.288
[Tom] Come the fuck on, Bridge.

01:04:48.321 --> 01:04:49.723
Does this guy actually exist

01:04:49.756 --> 01:04:52.325
or is it, um, like that one time

01:04:52.359 --> 01:04:53.960
that you saw Brad Pitt
at Costa Coffee?

01:04:53.993 --> 01:04:56.529
-It was him. It was.
-Come on. Really?

01:04:56.563 --> 01:04:58.264
-[Miranda] Happy birthday.
-Lovely to see you.

01:04:58.298 --> 01:05:00.300
What on earth are you holding?

01:05:00.333 --> 01:05:02.135
Oh, Petula. [coos]

01:05:02.168 --> 01:05:03.403
A present to myself

01:05:03.436 --> 01:05:05.972
and I already prefer her
to any human.

01:05:06.006 --> 01:05:07.340
[gasps] Oh, hi.

01:05:07.374 --> 01:05:08.575
[guests]
* Happy birthday to you*

01:05:08.608 --> 01:05:10.643
Oh, here. Can you hold my baby

01:05:10.677 --> 01:05:12.445
while I feign surprise at
the cake

01:05:12.479 --> 01:05:15.248
that I chose
and bought for myself.

01:05:15.281 --> 01:05:17.217
Oh, look! Look at that!

01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:19.452
* Happy birthday, dear Talitha*

01:05:19.486 --> 01:05:21.388
Thank you. Oh, look.

01:05:21.421 --> 01:05:26.426
* Happy birthday to you*

01:05:26.459 --> 01:05:27.694
[guests cheering]

01:05:29.329 --> 01:05:31.131
[glass clinks]

01:05:31.164 --> 01:05:32.432
Thank you.

01:05:32.465 --> 01:05:36.503
Thank you all so much
for coming today

01:05:36.536 --> 01:05:40.140
to help me celebrate, well, me.

01:05:40.173 --> 01:05:41.374
[guests laughing]

01:05:41.408 --> 01:05:42.776
We love you, Talitha.

01:05:42.809 --> 01:05:44.978
-[all] Talitha!
-[Tom] Talitha! Happy birthday.

01:05:46.479 --> 01:05:48.314
Beep, beep. Beep, beep.

01:05:48.348 --> 01:05:50.450
[Bridget] Binko Carruthers.

01:05:50.483 --> 01:05:52.419
Oh, please don't come over.
Please don't.

01:05:52.452 --> 01:05:53.753
Beep, beep.

01:05:53.787 --> 01:05:57.524
There she is.
The famous Bridget Jones.

01:05:57.557 --> 01:06:00.593
So I told Cosmo
I'd take you out for a spin.

01:06:00.627 --> 01:06:01.594
How's Friday?

01:06:01.628 --> 01:06:03.530
-[barks]
-[yelps]

01:06:03.563 --> 01:06:06.099
-[Tom] Fuck, no!
-[guests clamour]

01:06:06.132 --> 01:06:09.235
Jude, get in there.
Come on, get the fuck in there!
God, help!

01:06:09.269 --> 01:06:11.204
Oh, my God. Oh!

01:06:11.237 --> 01:06:13.540
-[Talitha]
Petula, come on, darling.
-[Tom] Petula! Petula!

01:06:13.573 --> 01:06:14.607
["Mad About the Boy" playing]

01:06:14.641 --> 01:06:16.776
* I'm mad about the boy*

01:06:19.679 --> 01:06:21.715
* And I know it's stupid*

01:06:21.748 --> 01:06:24.617
* To be mad about the boy*

01:06:24.651 --> 01:06:26.419
Who's that?

01:06:26.453 --> 01:06:28.621
* I'm so ashamed of it*

01:06:28.655 --> 01:06:33.626
* But must admit
The sleepless nights I've had*

01:06:35.362 --> 01:06:36.796
* About the boy*

01:06:38.832 --> 01:06:40.233
[gasps]

01:06:40.266 --> 01:06:42.402
* Ooh, ooh, ooh*

01:06:42.435 --> 01:06:44.104
* On the silver screen...*

01:06:44.137 --> 01:06:45.138
[guests cheering]

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:51.311
* He melts my foolish heart
In every single scene *

01:06:53.413 --> 01:06:56.483
-* Although I'm quite aware...*
-[Talitha gasping]

01:06:56.516 --> 01:06:58.485
* That here and there
Are traces...*

01:06:58.518 --> 01:07:00.553
-I think this belongs to you.
-Thank you.

01:07:01.488 --> 01:07:06.159
* About the boy*

* Lord knows
I'm not a fool girl*

01:07:16.503 --> 01:07:17.804
-Hello.
-Hi.

01:07:17.837 --> 01:07:19.773
* I really shouldn't care*

01:07:23.610 --> 01:07:27.614
* Lord knows
I'm not a school girl*

01:07:28.848 --> 01:07:31.551
* Who's in the flurry...*

01:07:31.584 --> 01:07:33.353
Sorry I'm late.
Buses were a nightmare.

01:07:33.386 --> 01:07:34.587
It's fine.

01:07:36.723 --> 01:07:38.358
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:07:38.391 --> 01:07:40.593
She just jumped out of my arms.

01:07:40.627 --> 01:07:43.329
Do not apologise.

01:07:43.363 --> 01:07:45.165
Oh, my darling.

01:07:45.198 --> 01:07:46.833
Let me help you out
of those wet clothes.

01:07:46.866 --> 01:07:48.902
No. Don't you dare redress him.

01:07:48.935 --> 01:07:51.604
-You look gorgeous.
-You look gorgeous.

01:07:51.638 --> 01:07:55.108
* All because I'm mad*

01:07:56.209 --> 01:08:01.614
* About the boy*

01:08:01.648 --> 01:08:05.885
Now that, my darling,
is what I call a rebrand.

01:08:07.654 --> 01:08:09.756
Hi. I'm Roxster.

* We've come a long
Long way together*

01:08:31.611 --> 01:08:33.680
I hope he's up to it, darling.

["I Want a Little Sugar
In My Bowl" playing]

* I want a little sugar
In my bowl*

01:09:23.763 --> 01:09:25.398
[Bridget] If there is a God,

01:09:25.432 --> 01:09:27.801
I'm sure he had more to deal
with that night

01:09:27.834 --> 01:09:29.969
than my personal happiness,

01:09:30.002 --> 01:09:33.807
but it did feel like he'd taken
the night off everything else

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.709
to focus on me.

01:09:37.844 --> 01:09:39.912
But then...

01:09:39.946 --> 01:09:41.814
I wish I had a time machine.

01:09:41.848 --> 01:09:43.716

* What's the matter, baby?*

01:09:49.988 --> 01:09:51.624
[Bridget] A time machine.

01:09:51.658 --> 01:09:54.027
* Come on, save my soul*

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:56.496
[Bridget] In his moment
of inebriated joy,

01:09:56.529 --> 01:09:58.798
he had given himself away.

01:10:02.635 --> 01:10:04.504
* In my bowl*

01:10:04.537 --> 01:10:06.373
[Bridget] It mattered to him.

01:10:06.406 --> 01:10:11.444
And with that came the elephant
stomping heavily into the room.

[guest, audience laughing]

01:10:39.973 --> 01:10:43.576
[guest] Well, 60 in the morning
and a nap in the afternoon.

01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:47.580
[Talitha] Yeah, but you've got
so many interesting characters
in this show.

01:10:47.614 --> 01:10:49.616
So this show is for...

01:10:49.649 --> 01:10:50.984
[Bridget] Ghosting.

01:10:51.017 --> 01:10:52.852
The practice of ending
a relationship

01:10:52.886 --> 01:10:54.754
by suddenly and without
explanation

01:10:54.788 --> 01:10:57.057
withdrawing from
all communication.

01:10:58.792 --> 01:11:02.062
* That you give me
No reason why you...*

01:11:02.095 --> 01:11:05.932
[Bridget] The slow unveiling of
reality and rejection.

* That you give me no
That you give me no*

01:11:08.068 --> 01:11:10.837
* That you give me no
That you give me no...*

01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:12.539
[Bridget] The casual cruelty.

To forsake his lover?*

* Don't you tell me no...*

01:11:44.104 --> 01:11:46.139
[Bridget] Do not text

* Don't you tell me no
Soul...*

Ghost the bastard back, Bridget.

01:12:22.208 --> 01:12:25.011
Just let him disintegrate
into nothingness.

01:12:25.045 --> 01:12:26.913
It can be a jungle out there.

01:12:26.946 --> 01:12:29.482
Yep. And I'm the giant panda,

01:12:29.516 --> 01:12:32.852
sexually obsolete and destined
to be alone forever.

01:12:32.886 --> 01:12:36.122
No. You will adapt and survive
like we all do.

01:12:36.156 --> 01:12:39.526
I used to be on the cover of
Vanity Fairin a flak jacket.

01:12:39.559 --> 01:12:42.629
And now I'm on the cover
of Good Housekeepingwith
a pavlova.

where's your special stuff?

01:12:47.901 --> 01:12:50.470
HD TV was
an extinction-level event

01:12:50.503 --> 01:12:53.673
for the fearless
career television presenter.

01:12:53.707 --> 01:12:57.477
I'm about to usher you
into your next chapter.

01:12:57.510 --> 01:13:00.847
[Cathy] Lip serum.
I get it on the dark web.

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:03.216
-Is it legal?
-Absolutely.

[Bridget] Adapt and survive.

01:13:19.232 --> 01:13:21.968
Ooh. Something's
definitely happening.

01:13:22.002 --> 01:13:25.772
It's either disastrous
or totally fantastic.

01:13:25.805 --> 01:13:27.107
Mummy!

01:13:28.875 --> 01:13:30.510
[slurred] Hi, sweetie.

01:13:30.543 --> 01:13:32.178
[Bridget] Shit.
What's happening to my voice?

01:13:32.212 --> 01:13:33.847
Mabel's shoes are on
the wrong feet.

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.749
No. My feet are on
the wrong legs.

01:13:35.782 --> 01:13:37.517
[Bridget, Walliker chuckle]

01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:39.219
Silly thing.

01:13:39.252 --> 01:13:42.222
Mummy, something's wrong
with your mouth.

01:13:43.156 --> 01:13:44.090
No.

01:13:44.124 --> 01:13:45.692
[chuckles] No, there isn't.

01:13:45.725 --> 01:13:47.527
Yes, there is. Look.

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.562
Your lips
are all funny right there.

01:13:49.596 --> 01:13:51.865
[slurred, lisping]
Darling, don't be ridiculous.

01:13:51.898 --> 01:13:55.502
All right, Mabel, let's get
these swapped over, shall we?

01:13:56.603 --> 01:13:58.171
Out we pop. All right.

01:13:58.204 --> 01:14:01.875
I wouldn't do that again if
I were you, Mrs Darcy.

01:14:01.908 --> 01:14:03.176
You looked all right
to begin with.

01:14:04.811 --> 01:14:06.146
[Walliker] All right.

01:14:06.179 --> 01:14:08.882
[laughing] You're trying
to look younger

01:14:08.915 --> 01:14:14.220
and the effects have marked
similarities to those of
an elderly stroke victim.

01:14:14.254 --> 01:14:16.122
[laughing]

01:14:16.156 --> 01:14:18.992
You're actually drooling now.

01:14:21.761 --> 01:14:23.129
Oh, dear. [inhales]

01:14:23.163 --> 01:14:26.066
Now, acutely aware
as I am of my waiting room

01:14:26.099 --> 01:14:29.102
filled to capacity
with actual patients--

01:14:29.135 --> 01:14:31.271
not to mention the fact that
I am a gynaecologist

01:14:31.304 --> 01:14:33.606
and that particular
set of lips is,

01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:36.609
as it were, broadly speaking,
at the wrong end--

01:14:36.643 --> 01:14:39.612
I am nonetheless going to
ask you the question,

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:42.248
"Bridget, are you OK?"

01:14:42.282 --> 01:14:45.085
A simple yes will suffice.

01:14:46.319 --> 01:14:47.721
No.

01:14:49.622 --> 01:14:51.291
It's all your fault.

01:14:51.925 --> 01:14:53.793
[lisping]

01:15:15.715 --> 01:15:17.617
[crying]

01:15:21.154 --> 01:15:22.655
[paper ripping]

01:15:33.166 --> 01:15:35.902
"Twat." Sorry,
it's doctor's handwriting.

01:15:35.935 --> 01:15:37.671
That's an A,
in the middle there.

01:15:37.704 --> 01:15:42.308
[sighs] Now, I rather zoned out
after "pyjamas",

01:15:42.342 --> 01:15:45.311
but a toy boy is not the answer,
Bridget, and nor are big lips.

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:48.014
You're a widow

01:15:48.048 --> 01:15:50.150
with two wonderful children
who adore you.

01:15:50.183 --> 01:15:52.052
You're just trying to cope with
a shitty situation.

01:15:52.085 --> 01:15:53.720
Embrace the chaos.

01:15:55.221 --> 01:15:57.390
That's just a simple allergic
reaction to

01:15:57.424 --> 01:16:00.927
hydroxymethoxyphenyl
propylmethylmethoxybenzofuran

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:04.698
in whatever infernal concoction
you've smeared on your mouth.

01:16:04.731 --> 01:16:07.734
-[whimpers]
-[Dr Rawlings] This is
an antihistamine.

01:16:07.767 --> 01:16:09.202
It'll work straight away.

01:16:10.103 --> 01:16:12.305
It's for the lips.

01:16:12.339 --> 01:16:15.375
They still haven't invented
anything for being a twat.

01:16:19.846 --> 01:16:21.147
[slurping]

01:16:21.181 --> 01:16:22.382

Hello.

01:16:30.023 --> 01:16:31.658
[lisping] Yes, this is Bridget.

01:16:33.059 --> 01:16:35.362
Of course! Straight away.

01:16:37.964 --> 01:16:39.132
Yes, yes.

01:16:44.938 --> 01:16:45.939
[Bridget] Daniel.

01:16:47.007 --> 01:16:49.442
Well, by all that's holy,

01:16:49.476 --> 01:16:51.311
Bridget Jones.

01:16:54.014 --> 01:16:54.881
[grunts]

01:16:56.182 --> 01:16:58.184
Nice of you to come, Jones.

01:16:58.218 --> 01:17:00.387
If I'd known,
I'd have worn a tinier nightie.

01:17:01.855 --> 01:17:02.822
What happened?

01:17:03.423 --> 01:17:05.091
My heart.

01:17:05.125 --> 01:17:06.459
Two massive surprises.

01:17:06.493 --> 01:17:09.129
One, I have one.
Two, it murmurs.

01:17:09.162 --> 01:17:11.865
They've, um, had a listen
and I don't know.

01:17:12.766 --> 01:17:14.134
Are you OK?

01:17:14.167 --> 01:17:16.002
Well, I thought I was having
a heart attack.

01:17:16.036 --> 01:17:18.438
My whole life passed before
my eyes.

01:17:18.471 --> 01:17:20.140
You actually featured
prominently, Jones.

01:17:20.173 --> 01:17:21.808
-Hmm.
-All the best bits.

01:17:21.841 --> 01:17:23.343
Rome. Mini-break weekend.

01:17:24.210 --> 01:17:26.413
Sodomy in Sainsbury's.

01:17:26.446 --> 01:17:28.048
[chuckles]

01:17:28.081 --> 01:17:30.283
But, uh, mainly,

01:17:30.316 --> 01:17:32.218
it was just me wandering up
and down the King's Road

01:17:32.252 --> 01:17:33.953
trying to twinkle
at 20-year-olds.

01:17:33.987 --> 01:17:35.488
Mmm.

01:17:35.522 --> 01:17:40.293
Perhaps it's an opportunity
for a new beginning.

01:17:40.326 --> 01:17:42.195
Brand-new Daniel.

01:17:42.862 --> 01:17:43.830
Mmm.

01:17:45.165 --> 01:17:47.801
I think I shall stay
right here...

01:17:49.336 --> 01:17:50.904
until you agree.

01:17:50.937 --> 01:17:52.939
Well that is kind of you,
Bridge, but, um...

01:17:54.074 --> 01:17:55.375
they told me I don't have long.

01:17:55.408 --> 01:17:58.111
-What?
-No, no, no. Fuck. No, not that.

01:17:58.144 --> 01:18:00.380
Well, maybe that.
No, they, uh...

01:18:00.413 --> 01:18:02.916
they're taking
me for some tests in a minute.

01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:10.390
The question is, would we say
I've become a fraction tragic?

01:18:10.423 --> 01:18:14.494
They asked me to put down
my next of kin.

01:18:14.527 --> 01:18:19.265
And the only person I could
think of who might remotely care
was you.

01:18:21.201 --> 01:18:23.503
-That's very sweet.
-[Daniel] Yeah,
but not deliberately.

01:18:23.536 --> 01:18:25.472
The point is, Bridge,
how have I arrived

01:18:25.505 --> 01:18:28.074
at this point
in my life with no kin?

01:18:28.108 --> 01:18:31.244
How could I possibly be kinless?

01:18:31.277 --> 01:18:34.414
But you're not.
You're not kinless.

01:18:34.447 --> 01:18:37.851
Well, I haven't seen Enzo
since he was two.

01:18:37.884 --> 01:18:40.487
And he is now being happily
raised by his mother

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:44.024
and an Italian aristocrat
who wears his jumper like
a shawl.

01:18:47.027 --> 01:18:48.461
So, lucky you, Jones.

01:18:49.863 --> 01:18:51.898
Your two,
the way they look at you...

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.436
just makes one realise...

01:18:59.172 --> 01:19:00.907
one's own fuck-ups, really.

01:19:02.475 --> 01:19:04.310
The glory of what
might have been.

01:19:09.115 --> 01:19:10.950
[sighs] Did you know...

01:19:12.419 --> 01:19:14.587
it was actually quite good

01:19:14.621 --> 01:19:17.090
with Gisele at the beginning?
[clears throat]

01:19:17.123 --> 01:19:18.858
I have to face the fact...

01:19:18.892 --> 01:19:20.393
[coughs]

01:19:20.427 --> 01:19:24.097
...that it may have been,
Jones, love.

01:19:25.031 --> 01:19:26.900
The real thing.

01:19:26.933 --> 01:19:29.135
I still don't know what
she was so pissed off about.

01:19:29.169 --> 01:19:30.403
You shagged her sister.

01:19:30.437 --> 01:19:33.106
Once. Massive overreaction.

01:19:33.139 --> 01:19:35.041
[Bridget laughing]

01:19:35.075 --> 01:19:38.211
God, I love you, Daniel.

01:19:38.244 --> 01:19:42.415
Despite your really quite
impressive

01:19:42.449 --> 01:19:46.019
lifelong dedication
to total fuckwittage.

01:19:46.052 --> 01:19:47.887
Yeah. [sighs]

01:19:49.055 --> 01:19:51.057
There's a lot I don't know.

01:19:52.025 --> 01:19:52.959
An awful lot.

01:19:54.627 --> 01:19:58.398
But I do know that my children
would give anything at all

01:19:58.431 --> 01:20:01.134
to have just one day
with their dad.

01:20:10.010 --> 01:20:13.113
-[door opens]
-[nurse] Time for your obs,
Mr Cleaver.

01:20:13.146 --> 01:20:14.514
Oh, right.

01:20:14.547 --> 01:20:16.583
And, again,
there is really no need

01:20:16.616 --> 01:20:19.185
for you to remove your gown.

01:20:19.219 --> 01:20:20.320
Sorry.

01:20:20.353 --> 01:20:21.888
[nurse] Okey-doke.

01:20:21.921 --> 01:20:23.256
God.

01:20:23.289 --> 01:20:26.459
Then lights down on
the cooking segment.

01:20:26.493 --> 01:20:29.062
Why do I always have to do
the cooking bits?

01:20:29.095 --> 01:20:31.498
That chestnut ravioli
he cooked last time

01:20:31.531 --> 01:20:33.266
was the worst thing
I've ever put in my mouth.

01:20:33.299 --> 01:20:34.901
I highly doubt that.

01:20:34.934 --> 01:20:38.038
And then, Miranda,
you cross to the stage.

01:20:38.071 --> 01:20:42.375
"And now, on Better Women,
a surprise guest." Blah blah.

01:20:42.409 --> 01:20:44.210
And lights!

01:20:44.244 --> 01:20:45.345
-[cheering]
-[music playing]

01:20:45.378 --> 01:20:46.646
* Yeah, I'm a fighter*

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.548
* And I made it through*

01:20:48.581 --> 01:20:50.283
* Solid gold survivor
That's...*

01:20:50.316 --> 01:20:52.052
-[Bridget] Hold it!
-[music stops]

01:20:52.085 --> 01:20:56.022
Linus, we've got to practise
following her with the lights.

01:20:56.056 --> 01:20:57.624
So, uh...

01:20:57.657 --> 01:21:00.527
maybe you could dance a bit?
Yeah?

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:03.163
-Uh...
-[Bridget] OK. Go, Linus!

01:21:03.196 --> 01:21:04.631
[music resumes]

01:21:04.664 --> 01:21:06.466
* So give me light*

01:21:06.499 --> 01:21:08.435
* You've got to find
Your own road...*

01:21:08.468 --> 01:21:12.105
Can you hold that, please?
See, you've got to,
you know, go for it.

01:21:12.138 --> 01:21:13.306
* Help me see...*

01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:15.375
'Cause she's going to,
you know...

01:21:15.408 --> 01:21:17.410
* And no more light
And no more love*

01:21:17.444 --> 01:21:19.412
* It's not over...*

01:21:19.446 --> 01:21:21.514
-[chuckling]
-* It's not over*

01:21:21.548 --> 01:21:23.483
* I won't save you when
I'm weak*

01:21:23.516 --> 01:21:25.251
* Only got so much left
To give*

01:21:25.285 --> 01:21:27.987
* It's not over*

01:21:28.021 --> 01:21:29.122
* It's not over*

01:21:29.155 --> 01:21:30.523
* Till I'm done...*

01:21:30.557 --> 01:21:33.226
[singer vocalising]

01:21:33.259 --> 01:21:34.661
* Till I'm done*

01:21:34.694 --> 01:21:36.196
-[song ends]
-[others chuckling]

01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:38.031
-See, Linus?
-[Roxster] Hi, B.

01:21:39.566 --> 01:21:41.201
[Bridget] Oh, shit.

01:21:43.136 --> 01:21:44.337
Brought a pie.

01:21:44.371 --> 01:21:47.040
-[bell rings]
-[crew chattering]

01:21:47.073 --> 01:21:49.576
[Roxster]
Sorry, they just told me
to come in.

01:21:51.778 --> 01:21:54.114
[Bridget]
You disappeared, Roxster.

01:21:54.147 --> 01:21:55.048
[Roxster] I know.

01:21:55.715 --> 01:21:56.716
I know.

01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:01.988
[sighs] I panicked.

01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:06.059
I got-- I got scared, and I ran.

01:22:07.193 --> 01:22:09.029
But I want this.

01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:11.097
You.

01:22:12.599 --> 01:22:16.069
I thought I wasn't ready,
but I am.

01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:18.738
I thought I...

01:22:18.772 --> 01:22:21.141
I don't know,
wanted somebody my own age,

01:22:21.174 --> 01:22:23.476
but I don't.

01:22:27.681 --> 01:22:29.582
I love you, Bridget.

01:22:33.319 --> 01:22:35.121
I'm ready for all of it.

01:22:35.155 --> 01:22:37.090
For Billy and Mabel.

01:22:38.158 --> 01:22:39.359
And burnt lasagne.

01:22:39.392 --> 01:22:41.594
And slime.

01:22:41.628 --> 01:22:43.763
[chuckles]
And all of it.

01:22:46.099 --> 01:22:47.734
[whispers] I promise you,
I am ready.

01:22:50.503 --> 01:22:52.639
[whispers] I'm not sure
that matters.

01:22:55.742 --> 01:22:57.777
What do you mean?
I don't-- I don't understand.

01:22:57.811 --> 01:23:00.613
[Bridget, voice breaking]
You're so lovely,

01:23:02.282 --> 01:23:04.317
and you're going to be

01:23:04.351 --> 01:23:07.554
a brilliant partner and dad.

01:23:07.587 --> 01:23:09.122
And you're going to discover

01:23:09.155 --> 01:23:12.325
all sorts of garbage that
will change the world.

01:23:12.359 --> 01:23:14.094
That's not how it works.

01:23:14.127 --> 01:23:15.495
But not with me.

01:23:15.528 --> 01:23:17.197
[exhales]

01:23:21.267 --> 01:23:23.236
I wish I had a time machine too.

01:23:25.305 --> 01:23:26.806
So you could catch up.

01:23:30.677 --> 01:23:32.579
Are you-- Are you sure?

01:23:34.814 --> 01:23:36.116
I am.

01:23:49.863 --> 01:23:51.531
I'll keep the pie,
if that's OK.

01:23:51.564 --> 01:23:53.299
[Bridget chuckles]

01:23:57.570 --> 01:23:58.705
Goodbye, Bridget.

01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:12.686
[Bridget] Parents' evening.

01:24:12.719 --> 01:24:15.855
Is there a worse night for
the single parent?

01:24:16.856 --> 01:24:18.591
They call it parents' evening

01:24:18.625 --> 01:24:20.827
as if it's a plural.

01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:24.164
As if it's a given that
there's two of us.

01:24:25.665 --> 01:24:28.702
Oh, well. Chin up and onward.

01:24:28.735 --> 01:24:30.303
[Walliker] Mrs Darcy.

01:24:31.771 --> 01:24:33.673
It's good to see you.

01:24:33.707 --> 01:24:35.742
Good to be back in the studio.

01:24:37.177 --> 01:24:40.146
[chuckles]
The great fruit fly debate.

01:24:41.314 --> 01:24:42.482
Uh...

01:24:42.515 --> 01:24:43.783
Small secret.

01:24:43.817 --> 01:24:45.652
It was about 50 times
more interesting

01:24:45.685 --> 01:24:47.787
than that
bloody thoracic surgeon.

01:24:47.821 --> 01:24:49.522
And don't get me started on
the physicist.

01:24:49.556 --> 01:24:53.226
I mean, they'll hand out Nobels
to anyone these days.

01:24:53.259 --> 01:24:55.395
Oh, yeah.
[chuckles]

01:24:55.428 --> 01:24:58.398
So, uh, Billy.

01:24:58.431 --> 01:25:01.267
Well, he's, um...
he's an excellent cricketer.

01:25:01.301 --> 01:25:02.469
-Mm-hmm.
-You know,

01:25:02.502 --> 01:25:03.937
he's a very good
young scientist.

01:25:03.970 --> 01:25:06.239
He's... he's got a good brain.

01:25:06.272 --> 01:25:10.677
He's methodical,
his experiments
are well drawn up.

01:25:10.710 --> 01:25:12.679
Look, I mean, it's just, uh...

01:25:12.712 --> 01:25:14.781
it's excellent work all round.

01:25:16.383 --> 01:25:19.686
-Good.
-It's just this,
Mrs Darcy. I'm...

01:25:20.887 --> 01:25:22.489
I'm a...

01:25:22.522 --> 01:25:24.557
I'm a bit concerned about him.

01:25:24.591 --> 01:25:27.727
Concerned? Concerned how?
What's he done?

01:25:27.761 --> 01:25:30.463
No, he hasn't done anything.
He's, um...

01:25:30.497 --> 01:25:32.165
He's just been a bit, uh...

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:34.701
withdrawn.

01:25:35.502 --> 01:25:36.770
Why is he withdrawn?

01:25:36.803 --> 01:25:38.838
Everything's been all right
at home?

01:25:38.872 --> 01:25:41.741
Yes, yes. It's all fine.

01:25:41.775 --> 01:25:43.810
[Walliker]
Everything OK with your, um...

01:25:45.879 --> 01:25:47.480
-hairdresser?
-[sighs]

01:25:47.514 --> 01:25:50.550
Him? No, but-but yes. Uh...

01:25:50.583 --> 01:25:52.419
He's withdrawn?

01:25:52.452 --> 01:25:55.488
-Well, I don't mean
to alarm you.
-[door opens]

01:25:55.522 --> 01:25:58.925
-Sorry about that. Yep, exactly.
-[Nicolette] Mr Walliker,
sorry, sorry.

01:25:58.958 --> 01:26:01.628
We're a couple of minutes early,
but these sessions are so short.

01:26:01.661 --> 01:26:03.930
And I have more than
a few questions for you.

01:26:03.963 --> 01:26:05.565
You don't mind, do you, Bridget?

01:26:05.598 --> 01:26:07.767
We do have the two boys, so...

01:26:07.801 --> 01:26:10.837
Not at all. No. That's...
It's fine.

01:26:13.039 --> 01:26:15.675
-Mate, I'm gonna have
to put you on mute.
-[Nicolette] Thank you.

01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:17.944
-[Nicolette] Right.
-[Victor]
I've got parents' evening.

01:26:28.855 --> 01:26:31.358
[owl hoots]

01:26:37.597 --> 01:26:39.532
[hoots]

01:26:39.566 --> 01:26:41.301
Mark Darcy, the leading

01:26:41.334 --> 01:26:43.970
international humanitarian
rights lawyer,

01:26:44.004 --> 01:26:46.973
was killed this morning in
the Darfur region in Sudan.

01:26:47.007 --> 01:26:49.509
[reporter] ...a land mine.
The 55-year-old was in

01:26:49.542 --> 01:26:51.778
the war-torn region
after joining international
efforts...

01:26:51.811 --> 01:26:54.447
Mr Darcy was a leading
international figure
in human rights

01:26:54.481 --> 01:26:55.815
and crisis resolution...

01:26:55.849 --> 01:26:57.450
[reporter 2]
...gained global recognition

01:26:57.484 --> 01:26:59.786
with the Kafir Aghani
and Eleanor Heaney case,

01:26:59.819 --> 01:27:01.354
which, of course, he won.

01:27:01.388 --> 01:27:03.790
He leaves behind his wife,
Bridget Jones,

01:27:03.823 --> 01:27:06.626
and their two young children,
Billy and Mabel.

01:27:06.659 --> 01:27:10.363
-More on this story as
we get it.
-[breathes deeply]

01:28:06.986 --> 01:28:08.555
[Bridget]
Dearest darling Mark,

01:28:10.156 --> 01:28:12.659
it's your birthday
on Sunday, and...

01:28:12.692 --> 01:28:14.427
[breathes deeply]

01:28:14.461 --> 01:28:17.630
...I'm just no good
at doing this on my own.

01:28:19.933 --> 01:28:22.002
I'm sorry
I'm such a bad mother.

01:28:22.035 --> 01:28:25.672
I'm sorry I got caught up
with a callow toy boy.

01:28:25.705 --> 01:28:29.509
I'm sorry I'm late for school
and that Billy's withdrawn.

01:28:31.111 --> 01:28:33.113
They're growing up without you.

01:28:34.714 --> 01:28:36.049
How is Billy
going to understand

01:28:36.082 --> 01:28:39.419
how to be a man without
his father?

01:28:39.452 --> 01:28:41.454
How is Mabel going to live
her life

01:28:41.488 --> 01:28:43.490
having never really
known you at all?

01:28:44.858 --> 01:28:46.559
Please forgive me
for being upset

01:28:46.593 --> 01:28:50.096
about anything which
isn't about not having you.

01:28:50.130 --> 01:28:53.033
Please help me find a way
to do this

01:28:53.066 --> 01:28:57.470
without feeling like
I'm ruining the most
important part of my life.

01:28:59.939 --> 01:29:02.475
The only part that
still has you in it.

01:29:17.490 --> 01:29:20.760
I have to put down how many
tickets we need
for my Christmas concert.

01:29:20.794 --> 01:29:23.129
-Mm-hmm.
-Should I put down two?
For you and Mabel?

01:29:23.163 --> 01:29:24.064
Put three.

01:29:24.097 --> 01:29:27.600
Mabel, me and Chloe.

01:29:27.634 --> 01:29:29.602
OK. Three.

01:29:30.570 --> 01:29:31.571
Finished.

01:29:31.604 --> 01:29:32.605
[Billy] Me too.

01:29:35.809 --> 01:29:37.143
[Bridget gasps]

01:29:41.981 --> 01:29:44.050
Daddy will love these.

01:29:44.751 --> 01:29:46.152
They're perfect.

01:29:46.186 --> 01:29:47.153
Yes.

01:29:47.187 --> 01:29:48.755
Did you write one, Mummy?

01:29:48.788 --> 01:29:50.156
I did.

01:29:50.190 --> 01:29:52.492
Tomorrow, can we post them
to Daddy?

01:29:52.525 --> 01:29:53.626
Of course we can.

01:30:10.944 --> 01:30:13.713

01:30:20.553 --> 01:30:22.555
OK. Ready?

01:30:23.823 --> 01:30:24.991
On three.

01:30:25.925 --> 01:30:29.462
One, two...

01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:39.506
What am I going to do when
I get to--

01:30:39.539 --> 01:30:40.707
...three.

01:31:24.918 --> 01:31:28.154
[Bridget] What I have is what
I love most in the world.

01:31:28.922 --> 01:31:30.924
Billy and Mabel.

01:31:30.957 --> 01:31:32.759
Just the three of us.

-[Bridget] Mr Walliker.
-Mrs Darcy.

Know...*

[student] Billy!

01:31:49.909 --> 01:31:51.778
-[Billy] Hello!
-[student 2] Hello!

01:31:51.811 --> 01:31:52.779
Ready?

01:31:54.647 --> 01:31:58.018
[Bridget, children]
* If you say that you are mine*

01:31:58.051 --> 01:32:01.087
* I'll be here till the end
Of time*

01:32:02.922 --> 01:32:07.260
* So you got to let me know*

01:32:07.293 --> 01:32:09.796
* Should I stay
Or should I go?*

01:32:11.364 --> 01:32:14.167
* Should I stay
Or should I go now?*

01:32:15.301 --> 01:32:18.571
* Should I stay
Or should I go now?*

01:32:20.106 --> 01:32:24.044
* If I go
There will be trouble*

01:32:24.077 --> 01:32:28.048
* And if I stay
It will be double*

01:32:28.081 --> 01:32:32.619

* Should I stay
Or should I go?*

01:32:35.355 --> 01:32:36.890
Have a good walk, then.

01:32:36.923 --> 01:32:37.924
[Walliker] Thank you.

01:32:37.957 --> 01:32:40.126
[students] Bye.

01:32:40.927 --> 01:32:42.095
All right, come in.

Now...

01:32:46.066 --> 01:32:50.103
what this is not is a "walk."

01:32:51.071 --> 01:32:53.039
We are about to embark as a team

01:32:53.073 --> 01:32:55.809
on an orienteering adventure.

01:32:55.842 --> 01:32:58.244
-So do you each have
your compasses?
-[students] Yes!

01:32:58.278 --> 01:33:00.814
-Do you each have your maps?
-Yes!

01:33:00.847 --> 01:33:03.149
[Walliker] Right then,
you know your groups.
Hands up, Otters!

01:33:03.183 --> 01:33:07.220
You'll go along with Mr Collins
and Bikram's mum, Mrs Pasricha.

01:33:07.253 --> 01:33:11.224
Billy's mum, Mrs Darcy.
You've drawn the short straw,
I'm afraid.

01:33:11.257 --> 01:33:12.959
You'll be joining me
and the Ospreys.

01:33:12.992 --> 01:33:15.829
Now, this is very important.

01:33:15.862 --> 01:33:20.266
Remember to open your eyes
and look around.

01:33:21.167 --> 01:33:22.268
This is one of the most

01:33:22.302 --> 01:33:24.871

01:33:26.806 --> 01:33:28.008
Enjoy it.

01:33:28.041 --> 01:33:29.275
Let's go.

01:33:31.344 --> 01:33:35.048
-You sure you're up to this,
Mrs Darcy?
-Absolutely!

01:33:35.081 --> 01:33:36.416
I was a Queen's Guide.

01:33:36.449 --> 01:33:39.352
-[chuckles]
-[Bridget] Got my Pioneer badge.

01:33:39.386 --> 01:33:42.989
I can rope, knot,
splice and lash.

01:33:43.023 --> 01:33:45.258
If you need anything tied up,

01:33:45.291 --> 01:33:47.827
I'm your girl.

01:33:47.861 --> 01:33:50.230
-[Walliker] Right then.
Bring up the rear.
-[students giggle]

01:33:52.198 --> 01:33:54.901
Yes! Bringing up the rear!

01:33:54.934 --> 01:33:56.336
Up!

01:33:56.369 --> 01:33:58.171
We're gonna see
much more water than that.

01:33:58.204 --> 01:33:59.305
[Bridget] Up the rear!

01:34:01.374 --> 01:34:02.375
Yep.

01:34:02.409 --> 01:34:04.310

[Walliker] Hurry along. Come on!

01:34:55.895 --> 01:34:57.897
-[Walliker] Give me your hand.
-Wow. So cool.

01:34:57.931 --> 01:34:58.965
OK.

01:35:01.101 --> 01:35:02.035
Right.

01:35:03.103 --> 01:35:04.471
Is there a Wi-Fi password?

01:35:04.504 --> 01:35:06.206
Oh, Atticus,
don't be a pillock.

01:35:06.239 --> 01:35:07.941
All right, take this tarp

01:35:07.974 --> 01:35:09.843
and spread it out on the floor
over there, all right?

01:35:09.876 --> 01:35:11.311
[Billy] Come on.

01:35:11.344 --> 01:35:13.847
[Bridget] It's all right.
It's dry. [chuckles]

01:35:16.816 --> 01:35:19.519
[Walliker] Mrs Darcy,
could you take that wheelbarrow,

01:35:19.552 --> 01:35:21.788
pick up some firewood
for when the rain stops?

01:35:21.821 --> 01:35:23.356
Yep.

01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:25.825
[Walliker] All right, everyone.
Do your best to get dry.

01:35:29.329 --> 01:35:31.498
[Bridget] Ding-fucking-dong.

01:35:31.531 --> 01:35:32.999
Whenever you're ready.

01:35:43.543 --> 01:35:45.445

we'll be here for a while.

[fire crackling]

01:35:57.257 --> 01:35:59.325
It really
is absolutely disgusting.

[chuckles]

01:36:01.895 --> 01:36:03.963

it's a brÃ»lÃ©e.

01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:08.401
[Bridget] Come on, then.

01:36:08.435 --> 01:36:10.203
Off to Bedfordshire.

01:36:10.236 --> 01:36:12.072
[student 4]
Goodnight, Mr Walliker.

01:36:12.105 --> 01:36:14.307
-[Bridget] Here we are.
-[Walliker] Sleep well, team.

01:36:14.341 --> 01:36:16.409
-Well done today.
-[student 4] Thank you.

01:36:16.443 --> 01:36:18.111
Okay. Night night.

01:36:19.579 --> 01:36:20.580
Goodnight.

01:36:29.422 --> 01:36:31.491
-Mission accomplished.
-[Walliker chuckles]

One barnful
of sleeping children.

01:36:34.961 --> 01:36:38.164
Don't get me wrong,
I'm quite impressed
by your resourcefulness,

01:36:38.198 --> 01:36:39.933
but who travels to
the Lake District

01:36:39.966 --> 01:36:42.168
with a backpack full
of marshmallows? [chuckles]

01:36:42.202 --> 01:36:45.271
All parents know the marshmallow

01:36:45.305 --> 01:36:48.208
is an essential tool,
Mr Walliker.

01:36:48.241 --> 01:36:50.143
[both chuckling]

01:36:52.979 --> 01:36:54.881
Do you have children?

01:36:54.914 --> 01:36:57.350
Uh, no. No, no,
I never did any of that.

01:36:58.351 --> 01:37:00.420
But, um...

01:37:00.453 --> 01:37:02.055
It's funny.
In the back of your mind,

01:37:02.088 --> 01:37:04.324
you think it might happen,
and-- [sighs]

01:37:04.357 --> 01:37:06.192
But, you know, one day,

01:37:06.226 --> 01:37:09.129
you're preparing a test
for a periodic table...

01:37:09.162 --> 01:37:13.533
-[chuckles]
-...and you realise
it's the 27th one you've set,

01:37:13.566 --> 01:37:15.969
and there's just never been time

01:37:16.002 --> 01:37:18.304
to really think about having
anything like a...

01:37:18.338 --> 01:37:20.106
like a family in between.

01:37:24.277 --> 01:37:25.445
But it's good.

01:37:26.413 --> 01:37:28.348
It's good. I, uh...

01:37:28.381 --> 01:37:29.649
Well, it suits me.

01:37:31.284 --> 01:37:32.419
Mmm.

01:37:33.987 --> 01:37:35.155
I see it does.

01:37:38.391 --> 01:37:39.926
I mean, look at that.

01:37:43.396 --> 01:37:44.531
All of it.

01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:52.205
You asked me where's
the wonder and the magic.

01:37:54.341 --> 01:37:55.675
It's a good question.

01:37:58.111 --> 01:37:59.412
I think it's here.

01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:03.516
You don't believe in magic,
Mr Walliker.

01:38:03.550 --> 01:38:04.951
[Walliker] No.

01:38:06.286 --> 01:38:07.687
Well, I've been thinking.

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:15.562

01:38:19.132 --> 01:38:20.266
[Billy] Mummy?

01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:21.735
Atticus is really frightened.

01:38:21.768 --> 01:38:24.738
He says his mum sings Puccini
to him when he's scared.

01:38:24.771 --> 01:38:29.275
Well, he might have to settle
for some early Take That,

01:38:29.309 --> 01:38:31.711
but I'll see what I can do,
okay?

01:38:33.046 --> 01:38:34.414
Mr Walliker,

01:38:34.447 --> 01:38:36.516
do you mind if I sit here for
a minute?

01:38:36.549 --> 01:38:38.218
Of course. Sit down.

01:38:53.566 --> 01:38:55.602
-Is there anything you want to--
-It's just...

01:38:56.503 --> 01:38:58.038
what if I forget him?

01:38:59.205 --> 01:39:00.640
I don't wanna forget him.

01:39:01.608 --> 01:39:03.476
But what if I do?

01:39:10.083 --> 01:39:12.218
Let me tell you this, Billy,
um...

01:39:14.254 --> 01:39:18.091
Your dad is everywhere.

01:39:20.193 --> 01:39:21.227
He's everywhere.

01:39:26.566 --> 01:39:28.768
And that's a scientific fact.

01:39:30.337 --> 01:39:34.240
Energy is only transferred.

01:39:35.342 --> 01:39:36.676
It can never be destroyed.

01:39:37.544 --> 01:39:39.446
And more importantly,

01:39:39.479 --> 01:39:41.548
your father is in you.

01:39:43.516 --> 01:39:44.784
And Mabel.

01:39:50.557 --> 01:39:52.058
Billy, tell me something...

01:39:54.594 --> 01:39:55.762
one thing...

01:39:57.197 --> 01:39:58.598
that you remember best

about your dad.

01:42:30.417 --> 01:42:34.721
* I'd do anything*

01:42:34.754 --> 01:42:39.659
* For you, dear, anything*

01:42:39.693 --> 01:42:44.597
* For you mean everything*

* To me*

01:42:48.635 --> 01:42:50.503
* I know that*

01:42:50.537 --> 01:42:54.474
* I'd go anywhere*

01:42:54.507 --> 01:42:59.612
* For your smile, anywhere*

01:42:59.646 --> 01:43:02.549
* For your smile*

01:43:02.582 --> 01:43:08.688
* Everywhere I'd see*

01:43:08.722 --> 01:43:11.691

* Leave me all your will?
Anything*

* Even fight my Bill?*

01:44:01.675 --> 01:44:02.809
Go, Billy!

01:44:07.514 --> 01:44:08.448
[Walliker] Bravo!

Oh, my darling.

[sobs]

01:44:47.687 --> 01:44:50.657
Daddy would be so proud of you.

01:44:50.690 --> 01:44:51.825
I know.

01:44:54.127 --> 01:44:55.962
[Walliker]
Well done, Billy. You nailed it.

01:44:55.995 --> 01:44:58.398
-Were you surprised, Mum?
-Yes.

01:44:58.431 --> 01:45:00.467
-Genius.
-Up top.

01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:02.402
[Walliker, Billy chuckle]

01:45:02.435 --> 01:45:04.971
-So, can I have a sleepover
with Bikram?
-Yes.

01:45:05.005 --> 01:45:06.940
-And did you bring my--
-Yes.

01:45:06.973 --> 01:45:09.109
Bikram! Nintendo!

01:45:10.944 --> 01:45:13.847
Mr Walliker, Billy was...

01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:16.016
The whole thing was...
[chuckles]

01:45:16.049 --> 01:45:19.452
-It was--
-It was magic, Mrs Darcy.

01:45:19.486 --> 01:45:21.121
[Bridget] No, it wasn't.

01:45:21.154 --> 01:45:23.456
What you've done for Billy...

01:45:23.490 --> 01:45:24.824
[stammers]

01:45:24.858 --> 01:45:27.394
People talk about moving on like
it means,

01:45:27.427 --> 01:45:29.829
you know,
leaving something behind,

01:45:29.863 --> 01:45:31.965
you know,
leaving someone you love behind,

01:45:31.998 --> 01:45:34.534
but perhaps it's more
that suddenly you see

01:45:34.567 --> 01:45:37.904
you can live at the same time
as all the things you've lost,

01:45:37.937 --> 01:45:42.108
and that you can be happy
even without them.

01:45:42.142 --> 01:45:44.978
And tonight,
I saw my son up there

01:45:45.011 --> 01:45:48.715
and I understood for
the first time in four years

01:45:48.748 --> 01:45:50.850
that he's going to be okay.

01:45:50.884 --> 01:45:52.919
And so, we're going to be okay.

01:45:52.952 --> 01:45:54.688
And you did that, Mr Walliker.

01:45:54.721 --> 01:45:56.089
It wasn't magic.

01:45:57.023 --> 01:45:58.992
It was you.

01:45:59.025 --> 01:46:03.730
So, I'll overlook your tendency
to be a little aloof--

01:46:03.763 --> 01:46:05.799
Some might call it
condescending.

01:46:05.832 --> 01:46:07.600
Supercilious is a good word

01:46:07.634 --> 01:46:11.471
and you probably don't hear it
enough, but the point is...

01:46:14.607 --> 01:46:15.675
thank you.

01:46:17.844 --> 01:46:19.012
[Nicolette] Mr Walliker?

01:46:20.647 --> 01:46:23.049
We're going to
The Spaniards for a drink.

01:46:23.083 --> 01:46:26.753
Um, and if you wanted to come,

01:46:26.786 --> 01:46:29.222
well, we'd be there

01:46:29.255 --> 01:46:33.793
because that's where we'll be.

01:46:33.827 --> 01:46:36.996
[Nicolette] Can't be taught.
Can't be taught.
It was unbelievable.

01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:38.898
-Mrs Darcy.
-The flautists,
an absolute triumph.

01:46:38.932 --> 01:46:41.101
[Francesca] One of the best
Christmas shows I've ever seen.

01:46:41.134 --> 01:46:43.636
[Nicolette] Christmas shows
don't get much better than that.
Extraordinary.

01:46:43.670 --> 01:46:45.839
No, it doesn't.
Don't look at me like that.

01:46:45.872 --> 01:46:47.707
-[Shazzer] Billy! How did it go?
-Billy!

01:46:47.741 --> 01:46:48.875
-I did a solo.
-[Jude] Oh!

01:46:48.908 --> 01:46:50.176
Congratulations.

01:46:50.210 --> 01:46:52.512
Come here. Have a squidge.

01:46:52.545 --> 01:46:54.514
He was brilliant.

01:46:54.547 --> 01:46:56.182
-Hello, Mabel. How are you?
-[Shazzer] Well done.
I bet you were.

01:46:56.216 --> 01:46:58.118
-Chloe has a video.
-[Tom] You look lovely.

01:46:58.151 --> 01:46:59.753
-[Shazzer] There's a video?
-[Jude] A video?

01:46:59.786 --> 01:47:01.021
[Shazzer] Chloe? Video?

01:47:02.589 --> 01:47:03.890
[Tom] Congratulations.

01:47:03.923 --> 01:47:05.525
Hi. Uh, four, uh...

01:47:05.558 --> 01:47:07.694
large glasses of white wine,
please.

01:47:07.727 --> 01:47:09.062
[Shazzer] Wine. Wine.

01:47:09.095 --> 01:47:11.131
Oh, house white. Party petrol.

01:47:11.164 --> 01:47:13.767
-[Billy] Bikram's here!
-[server] Your wine, ladies.

01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:16.803
-[Chloe] What are you doing
down there?
-Nothing.

01:47:16.836 --> 01:47:19.005
-[Shazzer] Well, there we go.
-Congratulations, darling.

01:47:19.039 --> 01:47:21.041
-To Billy.
-He was wonderful. Billy.

01:47:21.074 --> 01:47:23.209
-Absolutely wonderful.
-[Shazzer] Yes.

01:47:23.243 --> 01:47:26.513
But I can tell you, I...
I knew from his glow
it was a triumph.

01:47:26.546 --> 01:47:28.148
-[Bridget chuckles]
-No, honestly.

01:47:28.181 --> 01:47:30.116
I mean,
once you've tasted success...

01:47:30.150 --> 01:47:32.285
[Bridget, Shazzer laughing]

01:47:32.318 --> 01:47:34.154
[Jude] You had literally
one song, Tom.

01:47:34.187 --> 01:47:36.690
Yes, you know,
my mother always says

01:47:36.723 --> 01:47:39.192
if you've got nothing nice
to say, then shut the fuck up.

01:47:39.225 --> 01:47:41.061
Your mother's right,
so shut the fuck up.

01:47:41.094 --> 01:47:43.096
[Shazzer] We should never shut
the fuck up.

01:47:43.129 --> 01:47:45.565
Stop telling everyone else
to shut the fuck up.

01:47:45.598 --> 01:47:47.567
[Tom] We can, yes.

01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:48.568
[chattering within]

01:47:50.270 --> 01:47:52.872
-[Billy] No. Come on.
-[Bikram] Good overtaking.

01:47:52.906 --> 01:47:54.674
No, I didn't. That was him.

01:47:54.708 --> 01:47:56.543
Mum. That way.

01:48:03.283 --> 01:48:04.751
[Bridget] Mr Walliker!

01:48:06.686 --> 01:48:07.854
Aren't you coming in?

01:48:07.887 --> 01:48:09.856
Well, actually, I was. I...

01:48:09.889 --> 01:48:11.758
I wanted to say something
to you,

01:48:11.791 --> 01:48:13.259
but it's the wrong time.

01:48:13.293 --> 01:48:15.662
You're there with everyone,
and... [stammers]

01:48:15.695 --> 01:48:18.231
I'm better with people about
4 foot tall. [chuckles]

01:48:18.264 --> 01:48:22.035
4'1". That's my sweet spot,
as it turns out, so...

01:48:23.136 --> 01:48:24.804
Where are you going?

01:48:29.843 --> 01:48:32.679
Well, look, I really just wanted
to discuss Newton.

01:48:32.712 --> 01:48:34.314
Newton?

01:48:34.347 --> 01:48:37.350
I mean, we already covered
Newton's second law, gravity,

01:48:37.384 --> 01:48:39.919
in the tree when you were
pretending not to be stuck.

01:48:39.953 --> 01:48:43.790
But the one that's always
fascinated me isn't
the second law.

01:48:43.823 --> 01:48:46.960
I mean, any idiot can see that
an apple's gonna fall down.

01:48:46.993 --> 01:48:48.294
What's it gonna do, fall up?

01:48:48.328 --> 01:48:50.597
It's a hopelessly overrated law,
the second.

01:48:50.630 --> 01:48:53.800
No, the one that's always
interested me is the third law.

01:48:53.833 --> 01:48:55.301
You'll know what that is.

01:48:55.335 --> 01:48:56.636
Yes.

01:48:56.670 --> 01:48:59.606
[chuckles]
Of course. But go on.

01:48:59.639 --> 01:49:03.143
For every action,
there's an equal
and opposite reaction.

01:49:03.176 --> 01:49:05.245
It's a fundamental law
of our universe.

01:49:05.278 --> 01:49:07.781
It's, uh... It's an inescapable
fact of our existence,

01:49:07.814 --> 01:49:09.883
and I was coming to say that
you are...

01:49:11.051 --> 01:49:14.087
this force, Mrs Darcy...

01:49:15.321 --> 01:49:16.256
to me.

01:49:18.191 --> 01:49:21.795
Equal and... opposite.

01:49:21.828 --> 01:49:26.299
And just as Newton predicted,
it's irresistible.

01:49:28.835 --> 01:49:29.803
I see it.

01:49:32.105 --> 01:49:34.641
Right now, just standing here,
I feel it,

01:49:34.674 --> 01:49:38.078
and it's as real to me as
the things I loved when
I was a boy

01:49:38.111 --> 01:49:40.080
and first started looking at
the world.

01:49:40.113 --> 01:49:42.716
You see, it's not really order

01:49:42.749 --> 01:49:46.052
that we science people
fall in love with, Mrs Darcy,

01:49:46.086 --> 01:49:48.121
it's the beauty in things.

01:49:50.857 --> 01:49:52.125
The beauty,

01:49:52.892 --> 01:49:54.227
to be specific...

01:49:57.864 --> 01:49:59.199
in you.

01:50:03.903 --> 01:50:05.205
Oh.

01:50:06.072 --> 01:50:08.408
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

01:50:08.441 --> 01:50:10.343
-I don't know what
I was thinking.
-No, no.

01:50:10.377 --> 01:50:12.345
This is exactly why
I decided not to come in.

01:50:12.379 --> 01:50:14.347
I've clearly got entirely
the wrong end of the--

01:50:14.381 --> 01:50:15.982
-Mr Walliker...
-Look, I just want you to know

01:50:16.016 --> 01:50:17.951
that this is not going to be
awkward at all. At all.

01:50:17.984 --> 01:50:20.687
-Please stop talking. [shushing]
-With Billy and school.

01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:22.956
Let's just pretend this
never happened, please.
Let's just--

01:50:39.039 --> 01:50:41.408
It was either that or a whistle,

01:50:41.441 --> 01:50:44.444
and I haven't got a whistle,
Mr Walliker.

01:50:46.913 --> 01:50:48.448
Call me Scott, for God's sake.

01:50:50.316 --> 01:50:51.851
Yes, Mr Walliker.

01:51:02.429 --> 01:51:04.464
["Am I the Same Girl" playing]

01:51:09.803 --> 01:51:12.906
Right, shake it, shake it,
shake it. No, go mad.

01:51:12.939 --> 01:51:14.407
That's it. Now pour it out.

01:51:15.475 --> 01:51:16.443
Very good.

01:51:17.210 --> 01:51:19.279
Insert one cherry.

01:51:19.312 --> 01:51:22.716
And that, my friends,
is how we make a Dirty Bitch.

01:51:24.784 --> 01:51:28.054
Christ. That may even be
a Filthy Bitch. Pass that round.

01:51:28.088 --> 01:51:30.957
Now, similar but not at all
the same,

01:51:31.825 --> 01:51:33.026
the Bad Mummy.

01:51:33.059 --> 01:51:34.928
Little bit of vodka.

01:51:34.961 --> 01:51:36.363
-Yeah?
-Come here.

01:51:36.396 --> 01:51:38.365
Okay, you're in charge.

01:51:42.569 --> 01:51:44.037
[exclaims]

01:51:44.070 --> 01:51:45.939
Is that who I think it is?

01:51:45.972 --> 01:51:48.141
So they tell me, yeah.
What do you think?

01:51:48.174 --> 01:51:50.377
[Enzo] You have sad eyes,
angelo mio.

01:51:50.410 --> 01:51:53.046
Why so sad? They make me sad.

01:51:53.079 --> 01:51:54.814
I want to see the smile.

01:51:54.848 --> 01:51:56.016
Stop it.

01:51:56.049 --> 01:51:57.817
He's 16!

01:51:57.851 --> 01:51:59.519
Yeah. Late starter.

01:51:59.552 --> 01:52:01.321
[Nicolette] Where in Italy
are you from?

01:52:01.354 --> 01:52:03.189
-Bologna.
-Bologna.

01:52:03.223 --> 01:52:04.391
-Yeah.
-Say it again.

01:52:04.424 --> 01:52:06.226
-Bologna. [chuckles]
-Bologna.

01:52:06.259 --> 01:52:08.128
Enzo, the kids are gonna watch
a movie upstairs. You coming?

01:52:08.161 --> 01:52:09.262
He'll stay.

01:52:11.031 --> 01:52:11.998
Boys.

01:52:14.034 --> 01:52:15.368
I think you're proud.

01:52:15.402 --> 01:52:17.237
Relief, really, Jones.

01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:18.972
Kin, as you said.

01:52:20.407 --> 01:52:22.075
-Enzo.
-Yeah?

01:52:22.108 --> 01:52:23.410
[in Italian] Vieni qua.

01:52:23.443 --> 01:52:25.011
-I beg your pardon.
-Okay.

01:52:25.045 --> 01:52:27.113
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

01:52:29.082 --> 01:52:32.085
and one of the great loves
of your father's life,
Bridget Jones.
