WEBVTT

02:38.075 --> 02:40.868
Truck looks great.
There must be a fuckin' fortune here.

02:41.036 --> 02:43.120
I know...
Let's not in front of him, alright?

02:43.288 --> 02:44.497
OK, no problem, no problem.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.499
Tell me somethin', fellas,
what's goin' on? Shit.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.042
I been here too long. Talk to me.

02:48.210 --> 02:49.252
Just give us a minute.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.587
I ain't got no more minutes. Check
this out. I want you to see somethin'.

02:51.922 --> 02:54.966
You can't get no cleaner than this.
These are very popular with children.

02:55.133 --> 02:57.260
You know what this is in here?
A federal tax stamp.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.679
You can't get no cleaner than that!
Talk to me! Tell me somethin'.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.598
So go into business yourself
if it's such a great fuckin' deal.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.141
I would, but I ain't from Detroit.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.435
I don't even know nobody in town
that can handle a job this big,

03:06.603 --> 03:08.271
but you all got
all the connections, you know.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.231
Tell me somethin', shit,
I'm a businessman.

03:10.399 --> 03:12.108
- Do what you wanna do.
- It ain't easy to get rid of this shit.

03:12.276 --> 03:14.110
I know, but I'm a businessman,
this is my thing.

03:14.278 --> 03:15.736
I'm doin' business here.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.822
Warm up the truck.
Let's get the fuck outta here.

03:19.950 --> 03:22.118
- That's what I'm talkin' about.
- You're a sharp kid, I like you.

03:22.286 --> 03:24.120
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

03:24.288 --> 03:27.373
Cousin, my man, don't dash yet.
This is like two grand to me.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.500
- This doesn't look like $5,000.
- Let me see that.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.794
The deal's for 5,000.
That's about 2,000. Count it yourself.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.379
You know what, this pisses me off.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.464
I told my people it was
supposed to be five grand here,

03:35.632 --> 03:37.258
and look at this shit, they stiffed us.

03:37.426 --> 03:39.260
No, they stiffed you,
'cause I want my money, man.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.304
Son of a bitch, you can't
count on anybody today,

03:41.471 --> 03:43.806
but I tell you what, let's not
fuckin' hassle about it now.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.267
Take the two fucking grand
and on the next score,

03:46.435 --> 03:47.935
I promise I'll make it up to you.

03:48.103 --> 03:49.520
Look, don't jerk me off, all right?

03:49.688 --> 03:51.147
Jerk somebody else off,
this is bullshit.

03:51.315 --> 03:54.650
I need $5,000 dollars,
not 2,000 thing, don't do this to me.

03:54.818 --> 03:56.944
Don't be unreasonable.
You're not dealin' with Johnny Bananas.

03:57.112 --> 03:59.155
- I got you covered.
- I got no idea what Johnny Banana,

03:59.323 --> 04:01.324
but can I have my money...
Look, can I say it slow for you.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.826
I need five thousand dollars!

04:03.994 --> 04:06.370
Read my lips:
Five thousand dollars, is what I need.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.456
This is bullshit here.
I can't do nothin' with that.

04:08.624 --> 04:10.416
If you want to be a fuckin' asshole,
you can take the whole load

04:10.584 --> 04:11.751
and smoke 'em yourself in the park.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.628
- I don't smoke Lucky Strike.
- I got people I gotta answer to.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.339
- I smoke King Size Kent.
- I can't make a price of my...

04:17.089 --> 04:19.759
Fuck this.
Nice doin' business with you, kid.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.678
Hey, buddy, what you doin' here?

04:22.846 --> 04:24.722
Officers, do you know
what just happened?

04:24.890 --> 04:27.975
You ain't gonna believe this shit.
The truck, it just stopped, man!

04:28.143 --> 04:31.354
It just stopped! You got some
jumper cables, you give me a jump?

04:31.521 --> 04:33.522
Hey... don't I know you
from someplace?

04:33.690 --> 04:35.399
No, that ain't me, I'm from Buffalo.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.405
Both you guys, break out some ID.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.370
Let's get the fuck outta here!

06:20.797 --> 06:22.381
Shit! What the fuck?

07:50.512 --> 07:52.304
Oh, shit.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.352
Freeze, asshole!

08:07.320 --> 08:09.196
Foley, we should've known it was you.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.788
Hey, Axel, way to go!

08:17.956 --> 08:20.249
- I don't understand.
- I don't have time, Jeffrey.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.042
Todd's lookin' for you,
he's really pissed.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.586
He said this is your
worst fuck-up ever.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.297
Personally, I don't think that's true.
He's not in there.

08:26.464 --> 08:27.923
Yeah, I can see that, Jeff.

08:28.091 --> 08:30.593
If you'd busted these guys,
maybe he wouldn't have been so mad.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.970
Now I heard you got caught up
haggling for money?

08:33.138 --> 08:34.429
$2,000 wasn't enough money.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.097
If I took it, those guys
woulda known I was a cop.

08:36.265 --> 08:39.809
- Todd's gonna tear you another asshole.
- Don't go anywhere.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.854
I'm not sayin'
you did anything wrong.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.523
If you had busted these guys
it would've worked out better.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.317
That's all I'm sayin'.
Where you goin' now?

08:46.484 --> 08:48.068
I'm gonna go get my shit
and get outta here.

08:48.236 --> 08:49.612
No, big mistake, big mistake.

08:49.779 --> 08:50.738
- Want my advice?
- No.

08:50.906 --> 08:52.323
- You know what I would do?
- No, I don't.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.366
Talk to him.
He'll be right back.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.952
Get away from me or I'm gonna
shoot you. No time for you today.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.787
You know what I would do?

08:58.955 --> 09:01.790
Just lighten up. I'm not listening
to you. I'm not listening.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.792
You're makin' it a lot worse
for yourself.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.836
This is great, thank you guys.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.713
Hey, Axel, you got a cigarette?

09:09.633 --> 09:12.509
- Did you write that one?
- That's what I'm tryin' to tell you.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.303
Everybody knows about you
and the truck.

09:14.471 --> 09:15.930
Jeffrey, will you listen to me?

09:16.097 --> 09:18.224
I am not listening to you,
I'm ignoring you.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.643
Great! Great, real mature.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.395
I am not listening to Jeffrey,
but he's still talking.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.232
- I am not listening to you!
- I really hate when you do that.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.942
- Then stop then.
- It's childish!

09:28.109 --> 09:30.319
- Is that fuckin' Foley in here?
- Oh, shit.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.154
There's Todd, it's show time, OK?

09:33.823 --> 09:35.282
I know what you're gonna say...

09:35.450 --> 09:38.827
Where the fuck you come off
goin' undercover without authorization?

09:38.995 --> 09:40.496
What the fuck is this all about?

09:40.664 --> 09:42.581
You wanna play some
fuckin' bullshit cowboy cop,

09:42.749 --> 09:44.416
go do it in somebody else's precinct.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.168
Don't you want to hear
my side of the story?

09:46.336 --> 09:47.920
What's your fuckin' side of the story?

09:50.006 --> 09:51.298
Let's hear your side of the story.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.801
Axel, I'm not takin'
any more of this shit from you.

09:53.969 --> 09:56.345
You know how much this little stunt
is gonna cost this city?

09:56.513 --> 09:58.389
I don't think cost
is the issue here, sir.

09:58.556 --> 10:01.183
I think the issue should be my
blatant disregard for proper procedure.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.269
You damn right, wise-ass!

10:03.436 --> 10:06.105
The mayor called the chief.
The chief called the deputy chief.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.107
The deputy chief just
chewed my ass out!

10:08.275 --> 10:10.526
You see I don't have
any bit of it left, don't you!

10:10.694 --> 10:13.946
Where in the fuck did you get a
truckload of cigarettes from anyway?

10:14.114 --> 10:15.656
From the Dearborn hijack.

10:15.824 --> 10:18.367
The Dearborn hijack?
That bust went down last week.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.202
That truck is supposed to be
in the damn pound!

10:20.370 --> 10:21.537
I tried to tell you.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.664
Jeffrey, this is none
of your fuckin' business.

10:23.832 --> 10:24.790
This is not my locker.

10:24.958 --> 10:28.502
Listen, Axel, no more
of these setups, you understand?

10:28.670 --> 10:31.630
You're a good cop.
You got great potential,

10:31.798 --> 10:33.841
but you don't know every fuckin' thing.

10:34.009 --> 10:36.635
And I'm tired
of takin' the heat for your ass.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.054
One more time
and you're out on the street.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.889
- Do you understand me?
- Let me tell you...

10:41.057 --> 10:42.891
Do you understand me?

10:44.352 --> 10:46.103
Yeah, I understand.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.396
Boss.

10:49.024 --> 10:51.734
The chief ain't chew it all out,
you still got a little ass there.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.736
Don't fuck with me, Axel.

10:53.903 --> 10:57.072
Not now. Go on, go home.

12:16.820 --> 12:17.820
Hey!

12:25.078 --> 12:26.078
Hey, man!

12:26.246 --> 12:27.538
- How you doin'?!
- All right.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.498
I see you're still breakin'
in people's houses.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.668
What'd you expect with that lock?
Why didn't you buy a real fuckin' lock?

12:32.836 --> 12:35.629
I don't need no lock, I got my pistol.
I pop a cap in somebody.

12:35.797 --> 12:38.382
I can't afford no electrical bill.
Close my refrigerator.

12:38.550 --> 12:41.009
You got groceries
and shit all inside there.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.011
- Look at you!
- Yeah.

12:43.179 --> 12:46.515
- Yo, man, when you'd get out?
- I walked out six months ago.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.809
You got out six months ago,
and you're just comin' now?

12:48.977 --> 12:52.062
They got me out a year early for,
you know, good time,

12:52.230 --> 12:53.939
and I went out to California
to get some sun.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.943
- I got to show you somethin'.
- I ain't seen you in two years.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.491
Ten thousand Deutsche Marks.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.285
- Deutsche Mark?
- Yeah.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.536
What is that?

13:07.704 --> 13:10.164
They're bearer bonds.
They're bonds. Untraceable.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.373
You stole 'em?

13:12.625 --> 13:14.668
- No. It's not...
- I don't wanna hear it.

13:14.836 --> 13:16.378
I'm sorry I even asked.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.547
- It's just good to see you, man.
- I missed you, man.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.007
- Yeah.
- I missed you.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.593
What were you doin'
in California, anyway?

13:22.760 --> 13:24.344
- I was workin'.
- Workin' where?

13:24.512 --> 13:26.722
- Guess.
- I don't know, where were you workin'?

13:26.890 --> 13:28.140
Beverly Hills.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.852
- What were you doin'?
- You ain't gonna believe this man.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.605
- What?
- I was a security guard.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.902
Who the fuck's gonna hire you
as a security guard?

13:40.737 --> 13:41.862
Jenny Summers.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.238
Jenny Summers?!

13:44.407 --> 13:47.117
Oh, man, I haven't seen Jenny
in years! What she up to?

13:47.285 --> 13:48.744
Axel, she's doin' great, right?

13:48.912 --> 13:50.412
She's the manager of this art gallery,

13:50.580 --> 13:53.582
the Hollis Benton Art Gallery
out in Beverly Hills.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.543
It's like a world famous place.
You ever hear of it?

13:56.711 --> 13:58.545
Yeah, I buy all of my art there.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.882
Eight ball, corner pocket,
two cushions.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.717
Fifty bucks you don't make that shot.

14:03.885 --> 14:05.677
- Bullshit.
- A hundred.

14:05.845 --> 14:06.845
You got a bet.

14:15.772 --> 14:16.980
What are you gonna do.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.274
You're just as bright
as you always were.

14:19.442 --> 14:23.153
Twenty, 40, 60, 80, take it.
Have a party.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.113
Pleasure doin' business with you.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.575
What the fuck you gonna do?

14:28.743 --> 14:31.119
Miss, excuse me,
two more Scotch and sodas.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.084
I got a great idea.

14:37.252 --> 14:38.544
I got a great idea!

14:40.213 --> 14:41.797
Let's steal a car.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.802
Are you serious?

14:46.970 --> 14:49.471
I'm a fuckin' police officer,
I can't steal cars no more.

14:49.639 --> 14:50.847
- What's wrong with you?
- So what?

14:51.015 --> 14:53.642
Remember the time
you stole that car, man?

14:53.810 --> 14:55.477
A fuckin' Cadillac.

14:57.188 --> 15:00.566
We had to go and drive it
on the expressway.

15:01.359 --> 15:04.528
You fucking maniac.

15:06.656 --> 15:09.575
I also remember you had to go to jail
behind that shit, too.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.952
That wasn't a jail,
it was a state school.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.329
State school is jail
when you're 15 years old.

15:14.497 --> 15:18.875
Not jail, man, that's like...
That's like day camp compared to jail.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.004
How come you didn't tell on me
when you got caught?

15:22.171 --> 15:25.591
- You didn't tell we were together?
- You don't know?

15:28.094 --> 15:30.804
- You don't know?
- No.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.891
It's because I love you, man.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.608
One more round.

15:46.863 --> 15:49.072
Hold still, Mike.
I gotta open the door, OK?

15:49.240 --> 15:51.533
Balance yourself.
OK, here we go.

15:54.787 --> 15:58.373
I'm openin' the door now, OK?
Here we go. All right, here we go.

15:58.541 --> 15:59.625
Axel!

16:05.715 --> 16:07.924
Hey, Mikey. Where've you been?

16:08.092 --> 16:09.551
What's up, Zack?

16:09.719 --> 16:11.136
What do you got there, Mikey?

16:11.304 --> 16:13.555
Yeah, what's this, your laundry?

16:17.060 --> 16:19.561
I swear to Christ, Zack,
I was gonna bring 'em back.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.229
- Oh, you get lost?
- No.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.691
I came... I came here to see
my friend, I had 'em with me.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.443
I figured, you know...

16:27.570 --> 16:28.904
What are you doing?

16:29.072 --> 16:31.239
What am I supposed to do here, Mikey?

16:31.407 --> 16:33.909
Zack, there was a whole box
full of those things there,

16:34.077 --> 16:36.578
I took a couple of 'em. I didn't
think anybody was gonna miss 'em.

16:36.746 --> 16:38.538
I figured I'd take 'em...

16:38.706 --> 16:40.832
- Shut up.
- I'm sorry.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.751
- I'm sorry.
- No, shut up.

16:45.296 --> 16:47.589
- Man, please.
- Just shut up, Mikey.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.261
I swear...

16:56.265 --> 16:59.768
I swear, if you ever
show your face out there again...

16:59.936 --> 17:01.645
- I won't.
- Ever.

17:01.813 --> 17:04.064
- I won't, I promise you.
- Ever!

17:04.232 --> 17:07.108
Man, I'm sorry.
I fucked up, I'm sorry.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.652
- OK.
- I'm sorry.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.988
- OK.
- Ever. All right.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.809
Axel... I thought I told you
to go to the hospital

17:40.977 --> 17:43.145
and get that bump
on your head checked out.

17:43.312 --> 17:46.231
- My head is all right, man.
- It's not a request, Axel.

17:58.661 --> 18:01.163
Boss. Boss.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.832
Can I talk to you for a minute? Look...

18:04.000 --> 18:06.251
I heard a rumor that you're
gonna use Rand on this case,

18:06.419 --> 18:08.712
and between the two of us,
the guy doesn't know the time of day.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.505
Don't mess with me now, Axel.

18:10.673 --> 18:13.425
This is the first time he's
left his desk in 12 years.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.178
At least he's had 12 years.

18:16.345 --> 18:19.639
Anyway, it's a homicide case
and it belongs to Rand.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.224
Now, go to the hospital!

18:21.392 --> 18:23.560
Well, you don't mind if I
ask around a little bit, do you?

18:23.728 --> 18:25.604
Don't do a damn thing!
It's Rand's case.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.898
Your ass is skating
on thin ice as it is.

18:28.065 --> 18:30.942
Hey, look, we're talkin'
about a friend of mine here!

18:31.110 --> 18:33.320
Yes, we are, aren't we?

18:33.488 --> 18:35.197
Now, let's take a close look at that.

18:35.364 --> 18:39.451
One, a hoodlum friend.
Two, a professional hit.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.828
Three, in a cop's apartment.

18:41.996 --> 18:44.623
This whole thing stinks to high heaven.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.541
How you know
it was a professional hit?

18:46.709 --> 18:49.544
I didn't just walk into this town
from the cotton fields!

18:49.712 --> 18:52.839
Whoever killed your friend wasn't
worried about your little narrow ass.

18:53.007 --> 18:56.718
If they were, you'd be lyin'
beside him in that meat wagon.

18:56.886 --> 18:59.930
Just don't do a damn thing.
Stay outta this!

19:00.097 --> 19:01.932
Look, I got some
vacation time comin' to me.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.892
I wanna take my vacation now.

19:05.019 --> 19:06.394
Stay away from this case, Axel.

19:06.562 --> 19:09.397
No, it's just that I feel I need
a little vacation, that's all.

19:14.070 --> 19:17.739
All right, as soon as you're finished
at the hospital, you're on vacation.

19:17.907 --> 19:18.990
Thank you.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.160
But if you decide
to butt into this case,

19:22.328 --> 19:24.996
it'll be the longest vacation
you ever heard of.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.006
Checking in today, sir?

20:58.174 --> 21:00.342
That depends,
is this hotel real expensive?

21:00.509 --> 21:03.386
Not for Beverly Hills.
Can I get your bags for you?

21:06.182 --> 21:08.141
Yeah, that's my bag in the front seat.

21:19.862 --> 21:23.198
I'm sorry, sir, we just have
nothing available tonight.

21:23.366 --> 21:25.450
May I suggest next time
you call for a reservation,

21:25.618 --> 21:28.078
you do it at least a week in advance?

21:28.245 --> 21:30.038
Thank you.

21:30.206 --> 21:32.374
- Hi.
- The nerve of some people, huh?

21:32.541 --> 21:33.708
May I help you?

21:33.876 --> 21:36.044
Yes, you have a reservation
for an Axel Foley.

21:36.212 --> 21:37.379
Well, let's see.

21:39.757 --> 21:41.967
I'm sorry, I don't see anything
under that name.

21:42.134 --> 21:46.471
Oh, check Rolling Stone Magazine's
Axel Foley.

21:46.639 --> 21:47.973
That's what it is.

21:49.058 --> 21:50.475
OK.

21:51.227 --> 21:53.436
No, no Rolling Stone, no Axel Foley.

21:53.604 --> 21:55.230
- I'm sorry, sir.
- That's all right.

21:55.398 --> 21:57.607
You guys just probably just
made some mistake with reservations.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.567
Just give me another room,
and I'll go up and go to sleep.

21:59.735 --> 22:02.278
I'm sorry, sir,
but there are no rooms available.

22:04.615 --> 22:07.242
Don't you think I realize
what's going on here, miss?

22:07.410 --> 22:08.576
Who do you think I am?

22:08.744 --> 22:10.745
Don't you think I know if I was some
hot-shot from outta town

22:10.913 --> 22:13.331
that pulled inside here and you guys
made a reservation mistake,

22:13.499 --> 22:16.543
I'd be the first one to get a room,
and I'd be upstairs relaxing right now!

22:16.711 --> 22:18.211
Well, I'm not some
hot-shot from outta town,

22:18.379 --> 22:20.422
I'm a small reporter from
Rolling Stone Magazine,

22:20.589 --> 22:22.924
that's in town to do an exclusive
interview with Michael Jackson

22:23.092 --> 22:25.844
that's gonna be picked up by every
major magazine in the country!

22:26.012 --> 22:29.347
I was gonna call the article "Michael
Jackson Is Sitting On Top Of The World,"

22:29.515 --> 22:31.099
but now I think I
might well just call it,

22:31.267 --> 22:32.851
"Michael Jackson
Can Sit on Top of the World

22:33.019 --> 22:34.936
Just As Long As He Doesn't
Sit in the Beverly Palm Hotel

22:35.104 --> 22:36.396
Because There's No Niggers
Allowed in There!"

22:36.564 --> 22:41.067
Excuse me, sir, it seems that we
do have a last-minute cancellation.

22:41.235 --> 22:44.779
There is a room available.
It's a suite, but...

22:44.947 --> 22:46.906
I'll only charge
you the single room rate.

22:47.074 --> 22:49.659
Thank you, I'm sorry I got upset.
It's probably from jet lag.

22:49.827 --> 22:51.036
- I'm very tired.
- I understand.

22:51.203 --> 22:54.289
- What's the rate, anyway?
- That'll be 235 dollars a night, sir.

22:59.003 --> 23:00.712
Fine. Fine.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.839
And that'll be suite 1035.

23:03.007 --> 23:04.299
- Thank you very much.
- Yes, sir.

23:04.467 --> 23:06.551
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.471
If Michael calls,
tell him what room I'm in.

23:09.638 --> 23:10.972
Of course, sir.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.703
- How you are doing today?
- Hi.

24:15.871 --> 24:18.790
I'm fine, my name is Serge,
and how can I help you?

24:18.958 --> 24:22.043
Yeah, I'm looking
for Miss Jenny Summers.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.796
She's very busy today.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.339
Maybe you give me your name.

24:26.507 --> 24:30.135
- My name's Axel Foley.
- And what it's pertaining?

24:30.302 --> 24:31.886
I didn't understand what you said.

24:32.054 --> 24:35.223
Pertaining...
What it's meaning... regarding?

24:35.391 --> 24:38.059
Oh, what's it regarding?
I'm an old acquaintance of hers.

24:38.227 --> 24:41.312
Donny. One moment.

24:43.983 --> 24:47.527
Donny, run and tell Ms. Summers
that Mr. Achmed Foley to see her.

24:47.695 --> 24:50.280
- No, Axel Foley. Axel.
- Achmel, Achwel?

24:50.447 --> 24:51.781
Axel.

24:52.241 --> 24:54.951
Foley's here to see her.
He's a old acquaintance.

24:55.119 --> 24:57.745
- Donny, this is... Cover this up.
- I'm sorry.

24:57.913 --> 25:00.832
Like a breast of a dog
to scrub for the customer.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.585
- It's not sexy. It's animal.
- No, it's not sexy at all.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.921
May I offer you something to drink?
Wine, a cocktail...

25:08.299 --> 25:11.050
- Espresso?
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

25:11.218 --> 25:13.469
I make it myself back there
with the little lemon twist.

25:13.637 --> 25:16.472
- It's good. You should try it.
- No, I'm... I'm fine.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.683
I see you look at this piece.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.060
Yeah, I was wondering how much
something like this went for.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.854
One hundred and thirty thousand dollar.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.106
- Get the fuck outta here!
- No! No, I cannot.

25:25.274 --> 25:27.859
It's serious, because
it's very important piece.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.653
- Have you ever sold one of these?
- Sell it yesterday to a collector.

25:30.821 --> 25:33.823
- Get the fuck outta here!
- No, I'm serious! I sell it myself.

25:34.950 --> 25:37.076
Axel Foley, what on earth
are you doing here?

25:37.244 --> 25:38.286
How you doin'?

25:38.454 --> 25:40.914
I'm fine! Hold a second,
I'll be right down.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.124
Great, excuse me, Serge.

25:45.294 --> 25:47.128
- What are you doing here?
- How you doin'?

25:47.296 --> 25:50.256
- Oh, God, it's good to see you.
- Same here.

25:50.424 --> 25:52.091
- How have you been?
- I been... Look at you!

25:52.259 --> 25:53.635
- You like?
- Yes!

25:53.802 --> 25:55.136
- Is it good?
- You gettin' old.

25:55.304 --> 25:56.971
Fuck you.

25:57.139 --> 25:58.640
- What is this?
- A moustache.

25:58.807 --> 26:01.267
- Peach fuzz.
- No, that's man style now.

26:03.270 --> 26:05.104
You have some place
where we can talk real quick?

26:05.272 --> 26:07.440
Well, yeah. Right over there.

26:07.608 --> 26:08.983
- Great.
- Come on.

26:09.151 --> 26:11.486
- I can't believe how you filled out.
- Yeah, I filled out.

26:11.654 --> 26:14.322
No, it looks good though.
Sit down.

26:17.451 --> 26:18.993
I wanna talk to you about Mikey.

26:19.161 --> 26:21.204
Oh, is he in trouble again?

26:24.208 --> 26:25.625
He's dead.

26:28.170 --> 26:29.295
What?

26:30.214 --> 26:33.258
He's dead. He came to Detroit
and somebody killed him.

26:36.136 --> 26:37.262
I don't believe this.

26:47.940 --> 26:51.526
Look, I can't right now.
I'll be up in a second.

26:54.697 --> 26:57.073
Mikey mentioned that you
helped him get a job.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.285
Yeah...

27:01.787 --> 27:05.039
The guy who owns this gallery
hired him as a favor to me.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.041
Who's this guy?

27:07.209 --> 27:09.836
His name is Victor Maitland.

27:10.504 --> 27:13.589
He was working for Victor
at the gallery's warehouse.

27:14.717 --> 27:17.135
Look, Axel, I can't talk right now,
I have to go upstairs.

27:17.303 --> 27:18.886
That's cool.

27:19.680 --> 27:23.182
I'll call you later on, and we'll
get together later and talk, OK?

27:23.350 --> 27:24.684
Sure.

27:26.228 --> 27:27.645
Be good.

27:36.238 --> 27:38.072
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

27:38.240 --> 27:41.701
- I have a delivery for Victor Maitland.
- I'll take it right upstairs to him.

27:41.869 --> 27:43.745
Maybe I should give it to him myself.

27:43.912 --> 27:46.122
Well, deliveries are
supposed to be left on my desk.

27:46.290 --> 27:48.207
Yeah, but he has to get
these flowers, it's imperative.

27:48.375 --> 27:49.584
I'm gonna go up myself, all right?

27:49.752 --> 27:52.545
- You're not really supposed to go up.
- Floral delivery is my life.

27:52.713 --> 27:54.422
I have to take it up. Thank you.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.841
- Who let you in here?
- I let myself in.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.301
How you doin'?

27:59.094 --> 28:01.512
I have to ask you some questions
about Michael Tandino.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.058
Speak to you later, darling.

28:09.021 --> 28:12.273
And what, may I ask,
is your interest in Mr. Tandino?

28:12.441 --> 28:13.816
He was my best friend.

28:13.984 --> 28:16.110
He came to see me in Detroit
a couple of days ago.

28:16.278 --> 28:18.696
And a couple of hours after he
got there, someone killed him.

28:18.864 --> 28:22.116
Oh, my God! That's terrible!

28:22.284 --> 28:24.202
It's fucked up.

28:25.788 --> 28:29.123
And? What do you wish to know?

28:30.292 --> 28:31.709
He worked for you, didn't he?

28:31.877 --> 28:35.380
Yes, yes, he did. Good gracious.

28:36.799 --> 28:38.591
I'm really sorry to hear this.

28:38.759 --> 28:41.886
Would you like to sit down?
Can I get you anything?

28:42.971 --> 28:43.971
No, I'm all right.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.849
Well, how on earth did this happen?

28:47.017 --> 28:50.561
Detroit is a very violent city,
isn't it?

28:53.649 --> 28:54.732
Yeah, it is.

28:54.900 --> 28:59.695
Well, I do hope the police
have procured some intelligent leads.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.325
Exactly what was it
Mikey did for you here?

29:06.453 --> 29:08.830
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.

29:09.581 --> 29:10.665
My name is Foley.

29:10.833 --> 29:14.669
Well, excuse me, Mr. Foley,
if I appear a little rude,

29:14.837 --> 29:19.507
but this sounds like something
for the authorities in Detroit.

29:19.675 --> 29:23.302
So, if you'll forgive me,
I really must get back to work.

29:23.470 --> 29:24.887
Look, all I want to know is what kind...

29:25.055 --> 29:27.849
Gentlemen, would you please
show Mr. Foley to the door?

29:28.016 --> 29:29.350
- Get the fuck off me.
- Hey, take it easy.

29:29.518 --> 29:32.186
Yo, man, get the fuck off me.
Get off me, man! Get off me!

29:32.354 --> 29:35.189
Get the fuck off me! Get off!

29:36.024 --> 29:39.193
Get the fuck off me, man.
Get off me!

29:41.238 --> 29:42.530
Get the fuck off me!

29:42.698 --> 29:45.158
You think I'm playin' games, man? Hey!

29:45.325 --> 29:46.492
I'm fuckin' somebody up.

29:52.541 --> 29:53.749
Hey!

29:55.878 --> 29:57.462
What the fuck is this shit?

30:02.342 --> 30:04.719
Did you see that shit?
I can describe all of them.

30:04.887 --> 30:07.388
Please move to the side of the car
and put your hands on the hood.

30:07.556 --> 30:08.681
Why, what's with you guys?

30:08.849 --> 30:11.267
You heard what he said, sir.
Do it right now, please.

30:12.227 --> 30:14.812
What kind of shit is this, man?
Hold up, wait a second.

30:14.980 --> 30:18.399
You guys are arrestin' me for gettin'
thrown out of a fuckin' window?!

30:18.567 --> 30:20.943
I got thrown out of a window, man!

30:21.111 --> 30:23.321
Gun, partner!

30:23.489 --> 30:27.033
Sir, you are under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

30:27.201 --> 30:29.994
Anything you say can, and will be
used against you in a court of law.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.413
You have the right to have an attorney
present during questioning.

30:32.581 --> 30:34.874
Yeah, I understand.
I understand the rights.

30:35.042 --> 30:37.710
I know this is bullshit though.
I got thrown out of a fuckin' window!

30:37.878 --> 30:40.505
- Please get in the car, sir.
- Tell me somethin', what's the charge?

30:40.672 --> 30:43.424
Possession of a concealed weapon,
disturbing the peace.

30:43.592 --> 30:46.260
Disturbing the peace?
I got thrown out of a window!

30:46.428 --> 30:48.930
What's the fuckin' charge for gettin'
pushed out of a movin' car, huh?

30:49.097 --> 30:51.265
Jaywalking? This is bullshit!

30:58.315 --> 31:00.900
You know, this is the cleanest
and nicest police car

31:01.068 --> 31:03.194
I've ever been in in my life.

31:03.362 --> 31:04.946
This thing's nicer than my apartment.

31:08.951 --> 31:12.620
Officers, if we see any like...
movie stars, could y'all stop

31:12.788 --> 31:15.122
and point them out,
I never seen no shit like that.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.959
- That's enough talkin', pal.
- OK, that's cool.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.469
This is nice.

31:33.308 --> 31:34.392
Well, it's about time.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.727
Thought you forgot I was down here.
I was gettin' hungry.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.854
I never been in no cell
that had a phone in it.

31:39.022 --> 31:41.649
Can I stay for awhile,
'cause I ordered some pizza?

31:45.779 --> 31:47.071
Somebody'd eat it.

32:08.135 --> 32:10.011
Have a seat right over there, please.

32:17.185 --> 32:20.521
I'm Sergeant Taggart and this is
my partner, Detective Rosewood.

32:21.523 --> 32:24.191
You always treat visitors
from out of town like this?

32:27.237 --> 32:30.865
Why didn't you identify yourself as a
police officer when you were arrested?

32:31.033 --> 32:34.118
'Cause I was mindin' my own business.
Where the fuck do you guys get off

32:34.286 --> 32:36.203
arrestin' somebody for gettin'
thrown out of a window?

32:36.371 --> 32:38.623
We have six witnesses
that say you broke in

32:38.790 --> 32:41.459
and started tearin' up the place,
then jumped out the window!

32:42.252 --> 32:45.296
And you guys believed that? What
the fuck are you, cops or doormen?

32:45.464 --> 32:48.924
We're more likely to believe an
important local businessman,

32:49.092 --> 32:51.093
than a foul-mouthed jerk
from outta town!

32:51.261 --> 32:53.596
Foul-mouthed? Fuck you, man.

32:56.016 --> 32:57.558
- Hey, Sarg.
- You watch your mouth.

32:57.726 --> 32:59.727
Don't square off on me
with some bullshit.

32:59.895 --> 33:01.604
- You want to start some static?
- Don't push me!

33:01.772 --> 33:03.731
Fuck you, man.

33:03.899 --> 33:05.024
Taggart!

33:06.735 --> 33:08.069
Yes, sir?

33:09.196 --> 33:10.237
Come here.

33:26.713 --> 33:28.005
Sir...

33:28.965 --> 33:31.092
I apologize for striking you.

33:32.928 --> 33:34.303
I have no excuse.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.100
Forget about it.

33:39.267 --> 33:44.105
Detective Foley, I'm Lieutenant Bogomil,
of the Beverly Hills Police Department.

33:44.272 --> 33:46.273
Do you wish to file charges
against Sergeant Taggart?

33:48.860 --> 33:50.403
This is some kind of joke, right?

33:50.570 --> 33:54.699
Do you wish to file charges
against this officer for assault?

33:54.866 --> 33:58.494
Look, where I'm from, cops don't
file charges against other cops.

33:59.371 --> 34:02.123
No, I don't wanna do that.

34:02.290 --> 34:04.875
Well, in Beverly Hills,
we go strictly by the book.

34:06.294 --> 34:09.170
Now, why didn't you inform us
when you came to town?

34:09.339 --> 34:11.924
- I'm on vacation.
- Well, if you're on vacation,

34:12.092 --> 34:14.552
what business did you have
in Victor Maitland's office?

34:14.719 --> 34:15.844
I had to go to the bathroom.

34:16.012 --> 34:18.264
I was walkin' by, it looked like
a nice clean place, so I stopped.

34:21.016 --> 34:22.810
You always take your gun on vacation?

34:22.978 --> 34:25.603
I don't know,
I never been on vacation before.

34:25.772 --> 34:28.815
But in Detroit, cops are required
to carry a firearm at all times.

34:28.984 --> 34:31.444
Well, if you wanna carry a gun,
I suggest you go back there.

34:31.610 --> 34:34.196
I really can't wait to get back there,
if you wanna know the truth.

34:34.364 --> 34:35.489
Is that so?

34:35.657 --> 34:37.992
I just got off the phone
with an Inspector Todd in Detroit.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.119
Does that name ring a bell?

34:42.831 --> 34:43.831
He's my boss.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.917
He tells me you might not
be very welcome back there.

34:48.628 --> 34:51.672
He says that you're
an outstanding young detective.

34:51.840 --> 34:54.341
I find that very difficult to believe.

34:54.509 --> 34:55.717
But it's true, though.

34:55.886 --> 34:58.512
He also says they nearly had
to fire you for insubordination.

34:58.680 --> 35:01.390
I find that very easy to believe.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.185
Now, what are you doing
in Beverly Hills?

35:04.352 --> 35:06.687
I told you, I'm on vacation.
I went to the bathroom,

35:06.855 --> 35:09.190
the next thing I knew six guys
threw me out a window.

35:09.357 --> 35:12.526
Inspector Todd gave me
a message for you, wanna hear it?

35:13.445 --> 35:14.612
I don't think so.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.406
He says if you're out here
investigating the Tandino murder,

35:17.574 --> 35:19.867
you needn't bother coming back.

35:20.035 --> 35:22.953
He tells me that if we inform him
you are working on this case,

35:23.121 --> 35:25.956
he'll have you brought up
on charges and fired.

35:26.875 --> 35:29.251
Now, one last time,
what are you doing...

35:29.419 --> 35:32.963
- I'm on vacation!
- Vacation! Vacation.

35:33.131 --> 35:38.719
Rosewood, take Mr. Foley over to the
courthouse and let him arrange for bail.

35:39.721 --> 35:41.263
Would you follow me, sir?

35:42.015 --> 35:46.018
You know, I gotta hand it to you guys,
if anything you are extremely polite.

35:47.729 --> 35:49.897
Pretty good punch
you got there, Taggart.

35:54.444 --> 35:58.739
After you.

36:00.116 --> 36:02.117
You guys are so sweet, you know that?

36:03.995 --> 36:05.204
Thanks for bailin' me out, Jen.

36:05.372 --> 36:08.415
If I'd known why you'd been arrested,
I wouldn't have come.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.751
Oh, you don't mean that.

36:11.545 --> 36:13.212
No, I don't mean that.

36:13.922 --> 36:17.049
Axel, if it wasn't for Victor Maitland,
I'd be waiting on tables!

36:17.217 --> 36:19.260
It just so happens
that the day Mikey got killed,

36:19.427 --> 36:22.388
he showed up at my apartment
with a bag of German bearer bonds.

36:22.556 --> 36:24.723
I think he stole 'em
from whoever had him killed.

36:24.891 --> 36:26.141
When I mentioned Mikey's name,

36:26.309 --> 36:27.935
Maitland went nuts
and had me thrown out.

36:28.103 --> 36:29.645
Axel, you look like a hoodlum.

36:29.813 --> 36:32.481
You go barging into his office
without an appointment.

36:32.649 --> 36:33.774
You're carrying a gun.

36:33.942 --> 36:37.111
If you barged into my office and
I didn't know you, I'd throw you out.

36:37.279 --> 36:38.612
Is this your car?

36:38.780 --> 36:41.949
Oh, no, in Beverly Hills we just
take whichever car's closest.

36:42.117 --> 36:46.287
I remember you used to drive
that crappy, blue Chevy Nova.

36:47.664 --> 36:49.123
What are you driving now?

36:49.791 --> 36:54.461
The same crappy, blue Chevy Nova. You
think it's too late for me to study art?

36:54.629 --> 36:55.880
Yeah, I do.

36:56.673 --> 36:59.842
Axel, why were you bothering Victor?

37:00.010 --> 37:02.303
You don't think he has anything to do
with Mikey getting killed?

37:02.470 --> 37:06.849
Oh, no. No, I was just pokin' around,
I don't think he did nothin'.

37:07.017 --> 37:10.436
Axel, Victor Maitland
is one of the top art dealers

37:10.604 --> 37:13.397
in the United States.
He has been for ten years.

37:13.565 --> 37:15.107
I'm impressed.

37:20.071 --> 37:23.991
- What are you looking back there for?
- The cops, they're following us.

37:24.159 --> 37:26.702
What? Where?

37:27.621 --> 37:30.998
In the back on the right.
The beige Ford.

37:59.527 --> 38:01.028
Can you believe this place?

38:01.988 --> 38:04.448
Axel, how can you afford this?

38:04.616 --> 38:06.700
They're only charging me
the single room rate.

38:06.868 --> 38:08.035
How can you afford that?

38:08.203 --> 38:11.163
Actually I can't afford it. But you know
what they got inside that bathroom?

38:11.331 --> 38:14.249
They got little robes,
with little initials of the hotel on it.

38:14.417 --> 38:16.543
I love this place,
I can't leave this shit.

38:16.711 --> 38:18.045
I'm gonna steal one of them robes.

38:18.213 --> 38:19.421
- You want one?
- No, thanks.

38:19.589 --> 38:20.756
- You want slippers?
- No.

38:20.924 --> 38:23.384
I'm gonna steal them, too.
You should take some of this shit.

38:23.551 --> 38:25.177
Excuse me two seconds.

38:28.264 --> 38:29.723
Hello, room service?

38:29.891 --> 38:33.894
Yes, this is Mr. Axel Foley
in suite 1035. Yeah.

38:34.062 --> 38:36.397
I'd like to order something
from your late supper menu.

38:36.564 --> 38:39.775
But listen, I want you to deliver it to
this beige Ford parked out on Wilshire.

38:39.943 --> 38:44.029
Send down one
bay shrimp salad sandwich, OK?

38:45.323 --> 38:48.867
Right, and is the cold poached
salmon in dill sauce tasty?

38:49.035 --> 38:50.995
OK, send one of those down, all right?

38:51.162 --> 38:53.580
And send down something for dessert.
Thank you very much.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.249
All right, thank you.

38:55.417 --> 38:58.043
You're quite a sport.

38:58.211 --> 38:59.878
How long are you gonna stay?

39:01.047 --> 39:03.465
I'm gonna be in town
until I find out who killed Mikey.

39:05.927 --> 39:08.887
And I'm very seriously considering
going down to that warehouse

39:09.055 --> 39:10.931
where he worked
and checkin' that place out.

39:11.099 --> 39:14.435
Oh, really?
And how are you planning on getting in?

39:34.622 --> 39:36.999
- Good evening, sir.
- What the hell is that?

39:37.167 --> 39:39.626
It's late supper, sir,
compliments of Axel Foley.

39:39.794 --> 39:43.297
Foley? How did he know we were here?

39:43.465 --> 39:44.965
'Cause I let you drive.

39:45.133 --> 39:46.925
I need a couple bananas,
how much are they?

39:47.093 --> 39:49.303
Well, the buffet plate is $12.50.

39:49.471 --> 39:52.806
You get peaches, plums,
oranges and bananas.

39:52.974 --> 39:54.767
All I need is a couple of bananas.

40:00.774 --> 40:02.441
Go ahead, take those bananas.

40:03.276 --> 40:04.359
Thanks.

40:06.321 --> 40:08.072
Forget it, I'm not eatin' that.
Take it back.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.574
- Certainly, sir.
- This really looks great.

40:24.672 --> 40:26.423
Can I get some extra mayo?

40:26.591 --> 40:27.925
- Certainly, sir.
- Thank you.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.803
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.681
There's the Mercedes.
Will you get rid of that stuff?

40:50.573 --> 40:51.990
What the hell are you doing?

41:04.170 --> 41:05.379
This the place?

41:05.547 --> 41:08.590
Yeah, but I'm still not sure
I should do this.

41:08.758 --> 41:10.050
OK, you don't have to do anything.

41:10.218 --> 41:12.052
But when you hear glass
and shit breaking,

41:12.220 --> 41:15.639
don't get scared, it's just me
kickin' in the window. Sit tight.

41:17.183 --> 41:19.351
All right, come on, Axel.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.792
What's happenin', baby?

41:43.960 --> 41:45.711
Axel, grow up.

42:00.143 --> 42:02.311
- You find something?
- Coffee grounds.

42:03.438 --> 42:04.605
So?

42:05.815 --> 42:07.649
You know what this stuff is used for?

42:07.817 --> 42:10.444
Yes, some people filter hot water
through it and drink it.

42:10.612 --> 42:12.279
Yeah, I'm gonna take this home and
filter hot water through it

42:12.447 --> 42:14.781
and drink it in the mornin'.

42:28.796 --> 42:30.380
What are we hiding for?

42:31.299 --> 42:33.592
I tell you, I wish you'd been
with me last night.

42:34.886 --> 42:35.886
What happened?

42:36.054 --> 42:38.889
I stopped at a joint on the way home
to have a couple of drinks.

42:39.057 --> 42:41.934
- Yeah. Which one?
- One of the local joints.

42:42.435 --> 42:45.646
This guy comes in, he sits down
a couple of stools away.

42:45.813 --> 42:49.775
He's got one of them eyes
that's goin' like this.

42:49.943 --> 42:53.111
I didn't know if he was tryin' to
put the make on me, or what.

42:53.279 --> 42:55.030
So I thought I'd take you
over there tonight.

42:55.198 --> 42:58.200
Let him have a little shot at you
before I tore his head off.

43:09.295 --> 43:11.088
Come on, let's go,
I wanna get outta here.

43:11.756 --> 43:13.674
Why don't you get off my back.

43:13.841 --> 43:14.925
Come on.

43:19.138 --> 43:20.389
I got it.

43:37.407 --> 43:39.866
- Axel, what the hell's going on?
- I'll tell you later, come on.

43:41.452 --> 43:43.120
- Hurry up.
- "Hurry up."

43:43.288 --> 43:46.081
- Gimme the key, I'm gonna follow 'em.
- You ever driven a Mercedes before?

43:46.249 --> 43:48.542
No, but a car is a car.
I drive my car everyday.

43:48.710 --> 43:50.502
I'm driving, I've seen your car.

43:50.670 --> 43:52.838
Oh, shit, that's cold.

44:00.221 --> 44:01.888
A banana in your tailpipe!

44:02.056 --> 44:04.891
How could you not notice a man
sticking a banana in your tailpipe?

44:05.059 --> 44:07.102
- He distracted us, sir.
- And how'd he do that?

44:07.270 --> 44:10.897
He sent us a late supper, sir.
See, this waiter comes over...

44:11.065 --> 44:13.066
Billy, he gets the point.

44:13.234 --> 44:15.110
A late supper.

44:16.070 --> 44:17.696
And what did you have, Rosewood?

44:19.073 --> 44:23.577
I think it was a shrimp
salad sandwich, sir.

44:23.745 --> 44:26.747
- A shrimp salad sandwich.
- Yes, sir.

44:30.043 --> 44:33.462
I want you two to go back to the hotel
and wait for Foley to show up.

44:34.172 --> 44:37.924
And if you lose him again,
don't bother calling in. You got that?

44:38.092 --> 44:40.427
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

44:41.721 --> 44:43.597
"A late supper."

44:45.725 --> 44:47.517
We've got something for you, Billy.

44:49.145 --> 44:51.271
An anti-banana disguise.

44:55.234 --> 44:56.568
It may come in handy.

44:56.736 --> 44:58.945
A little extra protection, Billy.

45:00.573 --> 45:02.074
Very funny.

45:05.078 --> 45:06.745
Come on, Billy, let's go.

45:21.135 --> 45:23.303
Why don't you take the car
and go on home?

45:24.055 --> 45:27.474
- Well, what about you?
- I wanna find out what this place is.

45:27.642 --> 45:30.268
Oh, I can tell you that.
It's a bonded warehouse.

45:30.436 --> 45:33.480
They hold our foreign shipments here
until they clear Customs.

45:33.648 --> 45:36.233
Well, I'm gonna go check it out.
Just take the car and go home, OK?

45:36.401 --> 45:40.320
Damn it, Axel!
I'm not gonna bail you out again.

45:40.488 --> 45:41.655
Go home.

46:38.713 --> 46:41.882
How you doin'? Could you come here
for a second, please?

46:43.551 --> 46:46.303
- Hi, do you have a match?
- There's no smoking in here.

46:46.471 --> 46:48.388
I'm not gonna smoke now,
I'm gonna smoke when I go outside.

46:48.556 --> 46:50.223
Thank you very much. Thank you.

46:50.391 --> 46:52.809
- Is your supervisor here?
- Yeah, he's in the office.

46:52.977 --> 46:54.853
- Can you get him for me?
- What's the problem?

46:55.021 --> 46:56.062
- You security here?
- Yeah.

46:56.230 --> 46:59.608
Then you're the fuckin' problem,
go get your supervisor, please. Now!

47:00.401 --> 47:02.527
- Now!
- OK.

47:09.911 --> 47:11.369
He didn't come back yet.

47:14.957 --> 47:16.500
Well, what do we do now?

47:17.668 --> 47:18.919
We wait.

47:22.507 --> 47:23.548
OK.

47:23.716 --> 47:26.301
- Can I help you?
- Are you the supervisor here?

47:26.469 --> 47:27.427
Yes, who are you?

47:27.595 --> 47:29.930
I'm Inspector Rafferty,
United States Customs Service.

47:30.097 --> 47:32.265
Has all this stuff
passed through Customs already?

47:32.433 --> 47:33.600
No, this is the bonded area.

47:33.768 --> 47:35.519
Then tell me something.
Answer a question.

47:35.686 --> 47:38.772
How can a black man, dressed like me,
just march into your warehouse,

47:38.940 --> 47:40.607
walk into the bonded area
and start poking around

47:40.775 --> 47:43.109
without anyone askin' me
any questions whatsoever?

47:44.195 --> 47:45.529
Well, I don't know.

47:45.696 --> 47:47.405
Thank you, that's the answer
I was lookin' for.

47:47.573 --> 47:50.450
Just give me your ID numbers,
'cause somebody's gonna lose their job.

47:50.618 --> 47:52.702
This guy gave me a match,
for Christ's sake.

47:52.870 --> 47:54.120
You gave him a match?

47:54.288 --> 47:57.958
Listen to me. I do security checks
all over the nation,

47:58.125 --> 47:59.834
and with the exception of Cleveland,

48:00.002 --> 48:03.296
this place has the worst security
in the nation!

48:03.464 --> 48:06.216
I suggest you call your wives,
'cause we're gonna be here all night.

48:06.384 --> 48:09.844
We're gonna check the background
of each and every crate in this section,

48:10.012 --> 48:11.805
starting with this one, right here!

48:11.973 --> 48:14.307
Wow.

48:14.475 --> 48:18.979
You know, it says here that by the
time the average American is 50,

48:19.146 --> 48:23.108
he's got five pounds
of undigested red meat in his bowels.

48:24.944 --> 48:26.611
Why are you telling me this?

48:26.779 --> 48:29.614
What makes you think
I have any interest in that at all?

48:32.159 --> 48:34.244
Well, you eat a lot of red meat.

48:35.413 --> 48:37.247
Now, the inspector needs
all the information

48:37.415 --> 48:39.833
- on those airway bill numbers.
- All the manifests, too.

48:40.001 --> 48:42.043
That's right, and he needs
the records of all shipments

48:42.211 --> 48:43.670
- due into the same destination.
- Right.

48:43.838 --> 48:45.964
- What's this all about?
- Just do it!

48:46.132 --> 48:48.133
You got some kind of warrant for this?

48:49.302 --> 48:52.721
You know, you have a very big mouth.
Are you hiding something from me?

48:52.888 --> 48:57.225
I bet that's your Porsche that's parked
outside. Isn't that your Porsche?

48:57.393 --> 48:59.311
How would you like for me
to have the IRS come down here

48:59.478 --> 49:01.771
and crawl up your fuckin' ass with a
microscope? 'Cause they'll do it!

49:01.939 --> 49:03.857
I've seen 'em do it!
It's not a pretty sight!

49:04.025 --> 49:06.568
I want you to know somethin', pal.
I want all y'all to know somethin'.

49:06.736 --> 49:09.529
I can have 25 agents down here
in 15 minutes,

49:09.697 --> 49:12.240
to march in here,
snatch up bonds from underneath you

49:12.408 --> 49:14.284
and you guys'll be
out of business permanently

49:14.452 --> 49:16.453
if I don't get some cooperation!
Is that understood?

49:16.621 --> 49:19.706
Don't get upset, we'll give
you everything you need. Right, guys?

49:19.874 --> 49:22.083
- Everything you need.
- That's not my Porsche.

49:22.251 --> 49:24.628
- I don't know whose it is.
- You ain't got nothin' to worry about.

49:24.795 --> 49:27.255
I don't know what you all think I am,
take me for some kind of fool.

49:27.423 --> 49:28.423
Hurry up! Quicker!

49:34.096 --> 49:37.057
You know, I noticed you've been
drinking a lot of coffee lately.

49:39.894 --> 49:42.604
Well, I think that's why you
have a hard time relaxing.

50:02.541 --> 50:04.125
Jesus Christ!

50:05.670 --> 50:07.504
You almost gave me a heart attack.

50:07.672 --> 50:09.214
What are you guys doin' here so late?

50:09.382 --> 50:11.591
You're a cocky son of a bitch,
aren't you?

50:11.759 --> 50:14.844
Look, if you're still mad about
the banana thing, I'm sorry.

50:15.012 --> 50:16.763
- Just needed a little time to myself.
- Yeah.

50:16.931 --> 50:20.725
Just wish I would've saw the expression
on your face when the car konked out.

50:20.893 --> 50:23.687
Yeah, very funny.
Lieutenant docked us two days' pay.

50:23.854 --> 50:26.022
Get outta here!

50:28.609 --> 50:31.319
- He's not kidding.
- No, he's not kidding.

50:33.114 --> 50:35.782
By the way, thanks for the sandwich.

50:36.283 --> 50:38.451
He meant it as a joke, Billy,
like the bananas.

50:38.619 --> 50:39.577
Hey, wait a minute.

50:39.745 --> 50:42.455
I'm a fellow police officer, I know
what it's like to be on a stakeout.

50:42.623 --> 50:44.791
When I sent that food down,
that was from the heart.

50:44.959 --> 50:46.042
Bullshit!

50:47.294 --> 50:49.087
Why are we always arguing, man?

50:49.255 --> 50:51.423
All three of us are cops,
we should be workin' together.

50:51.590 --> 50:53.758
We all had a very rough day today.

50:53.926 --> 50:56.594
What do you say,
we all go get something to drink

50:56.762 --> 50:58.596
and make up and be friends, huh?

50:59.432 --> 51:00.807
Forget it.

51:01.851 --> 51:04.561
OK, fuck it. I'm gonna
get somethin' to drink, all right?

51:04.729 --> 51:06.896
You guys can try to follow me
if you want to do that,

51:07.064 --> 51:09.816
but I lost y'all once today,
which means I can do this shit again.

51:09.984 --> 51:11.901
Why don't we just go get
somethin' to drink together?

51:12.069 --> 51:15.071
- Let's be friends.
- We don't drink on duty.

51:15.239 --> 51:18.283
OK, fine, all right, but listen to me.

51:18.451 --> 51:20.827
I found the perfect place.

51:20.995 --> 51:23.079
I saw it on the way over here.
It's perfect for you guys.

51:23.247 --> 51:25.749
You can go, it's very conservative,
and you guys'll love it.

51:25.916 --> 51:28.501
Don't worry, it's nice. Trust me.

51:53.235 --> 51:54.486
Hi, can I get you something?

51:54.653 --> 51:57.697
Yes! I'm havin' a great time.
Can I have a Scotch and soda?

51:57.865 --> 52:01.034
And the brothers... What y'all want,
like, light beers for the fellas.

52:01.202 --> 52:02.535
Two club sodas.

52:04.038 --> 52:07.123
You guys crack me up,
with this "on duty" shit.

52:07.291 --> 52:08.917
Billy! Billy.

52:09.084 --> 52:11.711
You don't have to be embarrassed
if your dick gets hard.

52:11.879 --> 52:16.049
It's a dick, it's supposed to get hard.
That's the whole object of this.

52:16.217 --> 52:19.135
Taggart's dick gets hard, but he won't
let you know, 'cause he's the boss.

52:19.303 --> 52:21.221
Boss's dick got to stay limp, right?

52:21.388 --> 52:23.765
I ain't on duty, so my dick can be hard.

52:25.684 --> 52:27.519
Hey, Taggart, look.

52:27.686 --> 52:30.730
Check that out, I found that
at Maitland's warehouse.

52:30.898 --> 52:33.066
Billy! Bill, here, give her this.

52:33.234 --> 52:36.402
Really, stuff that inside her
little thing and she'll go nuts.

52:36.570 --> 52:37.821
Excuse me.

52:40.366 --> 52:41.366
Billy!

52:44.203 --> 52:46.079
- What do you think?
- Coffee grounds.

52:46.247 --> 52:47.747
- Yeah!
- So?

52:47.915 --> 52:50.416
You guys don't know nothin'
about nothin', do you?

52:50.584 --> 52:52.752
Just got your badges and your guns
and you're on the job, right?

52:52.920 --> 52:56.589
Make sure we get the right drinks.
If I drink club soda, I'll throw up.

52:56.757 --> 52:59.384
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.

53:23.576 --> 53:25.618
- I think she likes you.
- Think so?

53:25.786 --> 53:27.287
There's no doubt in my mind.

53:29.123 --> 53:32.500
Taggart, see that guy
over there in the black coat?

53:33.961 --> 53:35.503
Black jacket?

53:36.672 --> 53:38.256
- Yeah?
- Well, it's June.

53:38.424 --> 53:41.259
Don't you think it's kind of hot
for a long, black leather coat?

53:41.427 --> 53:42.635
Yeah, a little bit.

53:42.803 --> 53:46.264
Yeah. Look at his partner over there.
They just came in together.

53:49.143 --> 53:51.561
Somethin's gettin' ready to go down.

53:51.729 --> 53:54.314
Why don't you go over there
and cover that guy for me, all right?

53:54.481 --> 53:55.523
What's going on?

53:55.691 --> 53:57.859
I'm gonna go check out
this asshole at the bar.

53:58.027 --> 54:00.486
Billy over here
is gonna make sure that I behave.

54:00.654 --> 54:03.156
Will somebody tell me what's going on?

54:07.494 --> 54:09.579
No bullshit this time.

54:12.958 --> 54:14.459
Just sit tight, Billy.

54:42.071 --> 54:43.196
Philip!

54:44.365 --> 54:46.783
Hey, man, what's happenin', Phil?

54:46.951 --> 54:49.744
I knew that was you!
He told me it wasn't.

54:49.912 --> 54:52.038
Said you don't come here no more,
but I said, "It's Phil!"

54:52.206 --> 54:55.291
- Get outta here, man.
- I told you it's Philip, you liar!

54:55.459 --> 54:56.876
Hey, Philip, gimme kiss, baby!

54:57.044 --> 54:58.962
- I said get the hell out of here!
- Hey!

55:00.881 --> 55:02.173
Everybody, freeze!

55:03.884 --> 55:05.885
Turn around. Turn around!

55:06.053 --> 55:07.929
- Phil!
- Get your hands on the table!

55:08.097 --> 55:11.891
Phil! What's wrong, man?
What's all the hostility?

55:12.059 --> 55:14.435
- Get back, man.
- What you doin' with all this gun, man?

55:14.603 --> 55:16.396
- I told you to get back.
- You changed, man!

55:16.563 --> 55:19.607
If you don't get back,
I'm gonna blow your fuckin' brains out!

55:22.569 --> 55:24.070
Police, move and I'll kill you.

55:25.739 --> 55:29.033
Don't move! Turn over!

55:29.827 --> 55:32.996
Way to go, Rosewood.
You're some kind of cop, you know that?

55:33.163 --> 55:36.290
Sorry for the disturbance, folks.
Everything's under control.

55:47.594 --> 55:48.594
Taggart!

55:50.514 --> 55:52.598
Would you mind explaining to me
what you and Rosewood

55:52.766 --> 55:55.601
were doing in a strip bar
out of our jurisdiction,

55:55.769 --> 55:57.228
when you were still on duty?

55:57.396 --> 55:59.439
Sir, before you chastise
these two officers,

55:59.606 --> 56:01.232
I think there's something
you should know.

56:01.400 --> 56:04.110
The only reason that they
were at a strip bar

56:04.278 --> 56:06.738
was because they were tailing me
and I went to this place.

56:06.905 --> 56:09.782
Now, these two officers were sitting
outside wondering what I was doing.

56:09.950 --> 56:12.702
I was in havin' a good time,
I'm into things like that.

56:12.870 --> 56:15.496
Anyway, these guys waited outside,

56:15.664 --> 56:17.457
and the only reason
that they came in

56:17.624 --> 56:19.792
was because they saw
two suspicious-looking gentlemen,

56:19.960 --> 56:22.462
with bulges in their jackets,
going into the place.

56:23.130 --> 56:25.882
Well, it turns out that these guys were
gonna commit a robbery, sir.

56:26.050 --> 56:28.593
These men watched them,
waited for them to make their move

56:28.761 --> 56:30.428
and then they foiled the crime.

56:30.596 --> 56:33.890
I did not know what was goin' on.
I was watchin' the show, havin' fun.

56:34.058 --> 56:36.559
I'm still freaked out by it.
They must have a sixth sense or...

56:36.727 --> 56:41.439
I don't know what you teach these
fellows, but they're not regular cops.

56:41.607 --> 56:42.690
They're super cops.

56:42.858 --> 56:45.777
And the only thing missing
on these guys are capes.

56:49.865 --> 56:51.657
Is this what really happened?

56:54.161 --> 56:55.661
No, sir.

56:55.829 --> 56:58.998
Would someone like to tell me
what really happened?

57:01.001 --> 57:02.418
Well...

57:03.253 --> 57:07.006
Foley invited us to this bar...
and we accepted.

57:07.174 --> 57:09.342
We ordered club soda, sir.

57:09.510 --> 57:13.137
Right. And while we were there...

57:14.014 --> 57:18.101
...Foley observed the two suspects
casing the establishment.

57:18.268 --> 57:20.770
And before we knew
what was going on...

57:21.814 --> 57:23.981
...he'd already disarmed one of them.

57:25.484 --> 57:30.071
Detective Foley deserves
all the credit for the arrest, sir.

57:30.239 --> 57:34.200
Detective Foley,
we appreciate your assistance.

57:34.827 --> 57:37.453
But in the future, if you want
to practice law enforcement,

57:37.621 --> 57:40.206
I would prefer you did it in Detroit.

57:41.625 --> 57:43.167
I understand, sir. I'm sorry.

57:43.335 --> 57:46.379
But before I go I just want you
two to know something, all right?

57:46.547 --> 57:49.590
The super cop story was working.

57:50.384 --> 57:54.011
OK? It was working
and you guys messed it up.

57:54.179 --> 57:58.724
OK? I'm tryin' to figure
you guys out, but I haven't yet.

57:58.892 --> 58:00.226
But it's cool.

58:00.394 --> 58:03.146
You fuck up a perfectly
good lie and it's all right.

58:09.695 --> 58:12.655
You guys are off the case.

58:12.823 --> 58:16.826
Foster. McCabe. Your turn.

58:18.078 --> 58:19.245
Don't lose him.

58:20.497 --> 58:21.956
Not a chance, sir.

58:23.667 --> 58:27.420
And you two... in my office.

58:46.106 --> 58:48.608
Morning, gentlemen.
Some coffee and donuts?

58:49.443 --> 58:51.694
- What?
- Coffee and donuts.

58:57.868 --> 58:59.118
There he is.

59:15.969 --> 59:18.971
Morning, officers.
What you all, the second team?

59:20.349 --> 59:21.557
We're the first team.

59:21.725 --> 59:24.810
Yeah. We're not gonna fall
for a banana in the tailpipe.

59:24.978 --> 59:27.855
"You're not going to fall
for the banana in the tailpipe?"

59:28.023 --> 59:30.566
It should be more natural, brother,
it should flow out, like this:

59:30.734 --> 59:33.486
"Look man, I ain't fallin'
for no banana in my tailpipe!"

59:33.654 --> 59:35.238
See, that's more natural for us.

59:35.405 --> 59:36.989
You been hangin' out
with this dude too long.

59:40.535 --> 59:43.913
I'm sorry, I'm just fuckin' with you.
That's funny to me. Sorry.

59:44.081 --> 59:46.123
So, y'all gonna try and keep up with me?

59:46.291 --> 59:49.669
- No problem.
- Isn't this Victor Maitland's house?

59:49.836 --> 59:51.504
Yeah, I think so.

59:54.675 --> 59:56.175
Well, I seen enough.

59:56.343 --> 59:58.010
Y'all want somethin' to drink?
A beer or somethin'?

59:58.178 --> 01:00:00.680
I got some stuff in the trunk.
Excuse me.

01:00:13.694 --> 01:00:15.319
For a man who claims to be on vacation,

01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:17.029
you look a lot like
you're on a stakeout.

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:21.575
Stakeout? No, no, I'm picnicking.
This is like a picnic area.

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:32.044
Well, guys, I been
shootin' the shit long enough.

01:00:32.212 --> 01:00:34.880
Time for me to take in some sights.
Excuse me.

01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:29.226
What the hell's he doing?

01:02:28.161 --> 01:02:29.912
Can you put this in a good spot?

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.165
All this shit happened the last time
I parked here. Thank you.

01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:02.486
May I help you?

01:03:03.738 --> 01:03:06.407
Yes, I'm looking for Victor Maitland.

01:03:07.909 --> 01:03:10.202
You realize that this is
a members-only club?

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:13.038
But I have to talk to Victor,
it's very, very important.

01:03:13.206 --> 01:03:15.332
Are you sure it's
Victor Maitland you want?

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:20.087
Oh, yes, the grey haired gentleman,
very dark skin, Capricorn. Victor.

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:24.508
Well, why don't you give me
the message and I'll take it to him.

01:03:24.676 --> 01:03:26.385
OK, I guess I can do that.

01:03:26.553 --> 01:03:29.680
Tell Victor that Ramon,
the fella he met about a week ago,

01:03:29.848 --> 01:03:32.475
tell him that Ramon
went to the clinic today

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:35.561
and I found out that I have...

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.063
...Herpes symplex ten.

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:41.650
And I think Victor should go check
himself out with his physician

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:44.862
to make sure everything is fine, before
things start fallin' off on the man.

01:03:47.449 --> 01:03:49.742
Perhaps you better tell him that.

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:54.330
You know, I think that would be best.

01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:56.081
So do I.

01:04:11.223 --> 01:04:12.598
Hi, Victor.

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:17.269
I'm back.

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:25.945
Look, cuz, don't even try it, OK?

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.782
Why don't you get the hell
outta here, cuz.

01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:31.992
Get the fuck away from me.

01:04:48.552 --> 01:04:49.885
That's very good, Victor.

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:52.972
Could you teach him to roll over
and sit and do all that shit, too?

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:56.559
- What do you want?
- I want to talk to you.

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:58.644
Last time we met,
I didn't get a chance to talk to you.

01:04:59.437 --> 01:05:02.982
- I have nothing to say to you.
- That's cool, I'll do all the talking.

01:05:05.026 --> 01:05:07.611
This is a very nice place, Vic.

01:05:07.779 --> 01:05:10.614
Hi. I like this, this is nice.

01:05:11.658 --> 01:05:13.784
Glad you like it.
I must make you a member.

01:05:17.205 --> 01:05:21.125
You know, Victor, I know that you're
into a lot of crooked shit.

01:05:21.293 --> 01:05:24.545
And I have a pretty good idea
that you had Mikey killed.

01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:27.131
And when I find out for sure...

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:30.342
...I'm gonna fuck you up real bad.

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:31.510
Is that so?

01:05:32.846 --> 01:05:35.889
Now, listen to me,
my tough little friend.

01:05:36.057 --> 01:05:38.892
I don't know from under
what stone you crawled,

01:05:39.853 --> 01:05:43.397
or where you get these
ridiculous ideas about me,

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:45.983
but it seems painfully obvious

01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:49.987
you haven't the slightest fucking
idea who you're dealing with.

01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:54.366
Now, my advice to you is...

01:05:54.534 --> 01:05:57.369
...crawl back to your
little stone in Detroit,

01:05:57.537 --> 01:06:01.373
before you get squashed, OK?

01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:03.500
Please step away from the table, sir.

01:06:03.668 --> 01:06:05.210
Gotta go now, Vic.

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:07.755
- Nice meeting you again.
- Yeah.

01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:16.513
Catch you later, Vic.

01:06:16.681 --> 01:06:18.766
I can't wait.

01:06:31.905 --> 01:06:35.115
Don't I know you guys from some place?
You look so familiar.

01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:41.080
Detective Foley,
this is becoming very irritating.

01:06:41.247 --> 01:06:43.332
Why are you bothering Victor Maitland?

01:06:46.753 --> 01:06:50.422
I had a friend named Michael Tandino
that used to work for Victor Maitland.

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:53.592
And Maitland had him killed.
I can't prove that right now,

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.844
but when I do,
you'll be the first to know.

01:06:57.931 --> 01:07:00.891
Forget what you can prove.
Talk to me.

01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:06.438
OK, listen, everybody knows
that Victor Maitland

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:08.107
is a hot-shot art dealer, OK?

01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:11.402
But I did some pokin' around and
art's not the only thing that he deals.

01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:14.405
I went to his warehouse
and I saw some guys unloading a crate

01:07:14.572 --> 01:07:16.740
that was filled
with German bearer bonds.

01:07:16.908 --> 01:07:20.160
Now, my friend Michael Tandino
had bonds like this on him,

01:07:20.328 --> 01:07:22.788
coincidentally,
when he was killed in Detroit.

01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:23.956
Just because Maitland chooses

01:07:24.124 --> 01:07:26.125
to invest in the same kind of bonds
your friend had,

01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:27.876
doesn't necessarily mean he's a killer.

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:30.838
The man's not an investor,
he's a smuggler, OK?

01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:33.549
Be it bonds or drugs or whatever.

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:36.301
The crate that I saw
didn't even pass through Customs.

01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:38.137
Maitland is paying someone so his guys

01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:40.973
can get the shipments out of Customs
before they get inspected.

01:07:41.141 --> 01:07:42.975
Maitland's guys get their hands on it,

01:07:43.143 --> 01:07:45.310
they take the drugs
or the bonds out of the crates

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:48.564
and they send it back before
Customs even knows what's going on.

01:07:51.443 --> 01:07:52.901
And you witnessed all this?

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:55.362
Everything except for the drugs,

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:57.865
but I found coffee grounds
all over the warehouse.

01:07:58.867 --> 01:07:59.992
Coffee grounds?

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.119
You said something about that before.
What does that mean?

01:08:02.287 --> 01:08:04.580
Drugs are sometimes
packed in coffee grounds.

01:08:04.748 --> 01:08:05.998
The scent throws off the dogs.

01:08:06.166 --> 01:08:08.333
Very good, lieutenant.
Now what do we do?

01:08:10.712 --> 01:08:12.504
Look, Detective Foley, I...

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.674
I'm sorry.

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:17.341
I'd really like to help you.

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:20.679
If you'd found the drugs,
that's one thing,

01:08:20.846 --> 01:08:23.182
but if your only evidence
is coffee grounds,

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:24.975
we don't have enough
to get a search warrant.

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:26.852
Come on, guys,
I know how we can get around...

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.645
We don't get around search warrants
in Beverly Hills.

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:33.484
- Taggart.
- Yes, sir.

01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:35.277
I want you to start checking this out.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:39.031
Start with the LAPD, the FBI,
and the Customs Service.

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:40.573
Hey, wait a minute, Taggart.

01:08:40.742 --> 01:08:43.076
Look, lieutenant,
Maitland is much smarter than that.

01:08:43.243 --> 01:08:44.870
We go and start
snoopin' around his place,

01:08:45.037 --> 01:08:47.122
he's gonna close down and get
his shipments from someplace else.

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:49.541
- It'd be a big waste of time.
- Oh, really?

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:52.377
Is that what your extensive experience
leads you to believe?

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:54.755
- Look, I haven't been on your force...
- Sir!

01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:58.216
Oh, shit.

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:02.429
- Is this the man?
- Yes, sir.

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:06.099
Is this the gentleman who crashed
through Victor Maitland's window?

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:11.104
Who disabled an unmarked unit
with a banana?

01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:12.481
Yes, sir.

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:15.984
Who lured Taggart and Rosemont

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:19.571
into a gross dereliction of duty

01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:22.533
at a striptease establishment?

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.243
It's Rosewood, sir.

01:09:25.245 --> 01:09:26.495
Yes, sir.

01:09:27.412 --> 01:09:32.042
Is this the gentleman who ruined the
buffet at the Harrow Club this morning?

01:09:33.044 --> 01:09:34.752
Yes, sir.

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:39.716
I just bet you are the pride
of your department in Detroit.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:46.932
Lieutenant, I'd like to see you
in your office.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.268
Yes, sir.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:54.940
Is this the man who...

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:58.235
...wrecked the buffet
at the Harrow Club this morning?

01:09:58.403 --> 01:10:00.237
Lower your voice, for Christ's sake.

01:10:00.405 --> 01:10:02.573
Why, can the guy hear me
through the wall?

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.032
Yes, he can.

01:10:20.592 --> 01:10:25.929
Rosewood, take Detective Foley
back to his hotel room,

01:10:26.097 --> 01:10:29.808
watch him pack,
and escort him to the city limits.

01:10:31.311 --> 01:10:33.520
When you get there,
you can give him his gun back.

01:10:34.939 --> 01:10:39.318
The two charges of disturbing the peace
have been dropped against you.

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:42.321
But the chief says if you return
to the city of Beverly Hills,

01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:44.865
the charges will be reinstated

01:10:45.033 --> 01:10:47.534
and you will be prosecuted
to the limit of the law.

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:49.661
Sir, may I say something?

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:51.079
- Billy...
- What?

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:53.165
Well, he seems to have enough
to follow up...

01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:55.000
You wanna tell that to the chief?

01:10:56.544 --> 01:10:59.379
- No, sir.
- Then I suggest you get moving.

01:11:01.507 --> 01:11:02.674
Come on, Axel.

01:11:22.362 --> 01:11:25.364
Right. Let me check on that
tomorrow and get right back to you.

01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:26.823
Thank you.

01:11:27.325 --> 01:11:29.785
- Hi.
- Victor, hi.

01:11:29.953 --> 01:11:32.079
Sit down.
Hope I'm not interrupting you.

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:34.539
Of course not, don't be silly.

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:37.793
Jenny, there's a gentleman
in town from Detroit

01:11:37.961 --> 01:11:40.921
who says he's a friend
of Michael Tandino.

01:11:41.881 --> 01:11:45.175
He came by the office yesterday
and asked me all sorts of...

01:11:45.343 --> 01:11:47.469
...rather odd questions.
Excuse me, darling.

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:50.889
I believe his name is Foley.

01:11:51.057 --> 01:11:54.393
Since you were such a good friend of
Michael, I was wondering if you were...

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.645
...perhaps familiar with the fellow?

01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:59.648
Well, we... grew up
in the same neighborhood.

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:01.608
Really? Have you seen him lately?

01:12:03.403 --> 01:12:05.988
He... he came in yesterday.

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:08.240
What, came by here?

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:12.953
And?

01:12:14.789 --> 01:12:18.834
He told me that... Mikey'd been killed.

01:12:19.377 --> 01:12:22.087
Yes. Yes, I know.

01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:27.426
- And then?
- That's it.

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:31.388
He left and...
I haven't seen him since.

01:12:33.433 --> 01:12:36.560
You wouldn't, by any chance, know
where Foley's staying would you?

01:12:36.728 --> 01:12:40.313
I have some information
which just might be helpful for him.

01:12:43.568 --> 01:12:45.485
No, I have no idea.

01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:54.369
Yes.

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:57.289
Well, I hope I didn't
disturb you too much.

01:12:57.457 --> 01:12:59.541
Oh, no, no problem.

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:02.794
- We'll have dinner soon, yes?
- That would be lovely.

01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:04.129
Take care.

01:13:16.517 --> 01:13:18.060
Hey, Billy,
I read the manifest, all right?

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.604
They're expecting
another shipment in today.

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:23.648
- If Bogomil...
- Never mind Bogomil!

01:13:23.816 --> 01:13:26.485
This is a chance to blow this case wide
open, the two of us, what do you say?

01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:27.986
- Come on.
- Look, Axel...

01:13:28.154 --> 01:13:30.322
I wish I could, but I can't!

01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:34.076
- Why?
- Because Bogomil would kill me.

01:13:37.872 --> 01:13:39.164
Billy...

01:13:39.332 --> 01:13:41.917
I'm not going to drive you
to the art gallery, Axel.

01:13:42.877 --> 01:13:44.503
It'll just take a couple of minutes!

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:46.671
My friend Jenny'll let us
in Maitland's warehouse.

01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:48.965
We can be there when the shipment
comes in and nail 'em!

01:13:49.133 --> 01:13:51.134
How can you be sure
if it'll be drugs, or something?

01:13:51.302 --> 01:13:52.594
I got a hunch, OK?

01:13:52.762 --> 01:13:56.515
It's a technique by which many crimes
outside of Beverly Hills get solved.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.018
Why didn't you tell Bogomil
about this shipment?

01:14:00.186 --> 01:14:03.271
Bogomil does everything by the book.
You know what I'm startin' to think?

01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:05.565
That everybody
in this goddamn town is a robot.

01:14:05.733 --> 01:14:07.901
This thing is very personal to me.

01:14:10.363 --> 01:14:13.031
All they asked me to do
was drive you out of town.

01:14:14.367 --> 01:14:16.284
Now, I'm gonna screw that up, too.

01:14:18.746 --> 01:14:22.541
- Boy.
- Billy. I love you.

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:24.251
I just fell in love with you.

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:30.882
Jenny, how you doing?
This is my good buddy, Billy Rosewood.

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:32.342
- This is Jenny Summers.
- Hi.

01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:35.220
- Billy's a Beverly Hills cop.
- How do you do?

01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:36.513
That's Serge.

01:14:36.681 --> 01:14:40.392
Yo, Serge, will you
get my friend an espresso?

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.894
You want it with a lemon twist?

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:46.690
Yeah, sure, if it's no bother.

01:14:46.858 --> 01:14:49.860
No, don't be stupid.

01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:53.530
Axel, Victor Maitland was here
asking questions about you today.

01:14:53.698 --> 01:14:56.074
I'm telling you,
he was acting real weird.

01:14:56.242 --> 01:14:59.244
The reason I came down is 'cause
I want to get back inside the warehouse.

01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:02.497
- How 'bout I go with you?
- Jenny, come on, now.

01:15:02.665 --> 01:15:05.750
You work here with Serge,
in a art gallery. You're not a cop.

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:07.878
Axel, if this has anything
to do with Mikey,

01:15:08.045 --> 01:15:09.921
then I want to go
check it out for myself.

01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:12.174
I don't have time to stand here
and argue with you.

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:15.051
Wait a second. Let me get my keys...

01:15:15.219 --> 01:15:16.970
...and we'll argue on the way.

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:23.059
Billy, your job's just to sit
out here and observe things.

01:15:23.227 --> 01:15:26.313
- Don't make a move until I get you.
- I don't see why I can't come in.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.565
You can't go in
'cause you're a cop in this town.

01:15:28.733 --> 01:15:31.193
You go in without probable cause,
they're gonna call it an illegal search.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.778
Didn't they teach you that
in cop school?

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:36.865
Sit tight. If I find some evidence
I'll come out and get you.

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:39.117
- But you can't just...
- But nothing. Just be cool.

01:15:39.285 --> 01:15:42.621
If anything jumps off, I'll come
and I'll get you, all right? OK?

01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:44.372
Thank you.

01:15:45.249 --> 01:15:48.460
Any chance you're gonna give me that
key and let me go in there by myself?

01:15:48.628 --> 01:15:50.003
No chance.

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:54.424
Fuck. Come on.

01:16:40.346 --> 01:16:42.138
Looks like they been here already.

01:16:42.306 --> 01:16:45.183
- What exactly are you looking for?
- This.

01:16:45.351 --> 01:16:48.561
This is a crate from overseas,
hasn't passed through Customs yet.

01:16:58.364 --> 01:16:59.739
What is that?

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:12.210
Coffee?

01:17:12.378 --> 01:17:13.920
Yeah, it's coffee on top.

01:17:20.219 --> 01:17:21.678
But this ain't sugar.

01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:24.514
- Go get Rosewood.
- Welcome to the party.

01:17:49.915 --> 01:17:51.750
Seems we have guests.

01:18:12.938 --> 01:18:14.898
How nice.

01:18:15.066 --> 01:18:17.108
I do like surprises.

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:30.288
Jeannette.

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:39.130
I just can't tell you how disappointed
I am to find you here.

01:18:39.298 --> 01:18:41.716
- Victor, listen I...
- Shut up!

01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:45.178
I don't want to hear it.

01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:06.658
Take her to the car
and wait for me, OK?

01:19:06.826 --> 01:19:08.368
What are you gonna do with him?

01:19:08.536 --> 01:19:13.248
I think you should be more worried
about what we're going to do with you.

01:19:13.416 --> 01:19:16.084
Jenny, don't worry about me.
We got cocaine and coffee here.

01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:18.169
We're gonna get wired
and have a big party.

01:19:18.337 --> 01:19:20.755
Thanks for havin' me over Vic,
this is very nice.

01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:23.883
You say something?

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:40.191
If somethin' happens to her...

01:19:43.404 --> 01:19:45.363
I'm all ears.

01:19:46.824 --> 01:19:47.949
...I'll kill you.

01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:50.827
Really?

01:19:51.912 --> 01:19:53.371
That would be a neat trick.

01:20:05.259 --> 01:20:06.926
Well, cuz.

01:20:07.928 --> 01:20:09.554
Are you still pissed at me?

01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:14.559
Oh, no. No.

01:20:16.103 --> 01:20:18.188
But I should've taken care of you
in Detroit.

01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:26.404
When I popped your little buddy.

01:20:33.245 --> 01:20:34.787
Goodbye, Mr. Foley.

01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:38.583
Have a nice day.

01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:40.710
I'll try.

01:21:06.028 --> 01:21:07.320
Damn it.

01:21:10.658 --> 01:21:12.116
Oh, boy.

01:21:24.296 --> 01:21:28.383
How's that little bump on the head doin'
I gave you in Detroit, huh?

01:21:28.551 --> 01:21:30.134
Healed up nice, I hope.

01:21:56.328 --> 01:21:57.328
Freeze!

01:22:11.343 --> 01:22:12.427
Thanks, man.

01:22:27.568 --> 01:22:30.862
Tell Taggart to check out the warehouse
and act on whatever he finds.

01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:32.196
I'll explain it to him later.

01:22:32.364 --> 01:22:34.490
DD-6, Sergeant Taggart is here now,

01:22:34.658 --> 01:22:36.367
- and he wants to talk to you.
- Shit!

01:22:36.535 --> 01:22:39.454
Billy, what the hell is goin' on?

01:22:39.622 --> 01:22:41.664
I'm sorry, Sarg, I can't talk now.

01:22:41.832 --> 01:22:43.625
What you mean you can't talk now?

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:47.462
Just check out the warehouse and
please don't say anything to Bogomil.

01:22:48.547 --> 01:22:50.590
Sorry, sir, he's not
transmitting anymore.

01:22:50.758 --> 01:22:51.924
- Shit!
- What's the matter?

01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:55.303
It's Billy, he's doin' somethin'
dumb again, but I don't know what.

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:56.929
Was he calling from the hotel?

01:22:57.097 --> 01:22:58.556
No, sir.

01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:02.727
Right now his car is heading north
on Palm Canyon Road.

01:23:02.895 --> 01:23:04.604
Hey, we were there this morning.

01:23:04.772 --> 01:23:06.648
- What?
- Yeah.

01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:09.025
Foley was up there,
looking over Maitland's house.

01:23:09.193 --> 01:23:10.777
Do you have the address
of that warehouse?

01:23:10.944 --> 01:23:12.070
Yes, sir.

01:23:12.237 --> 01:23:15.573
Here. You two check that place out.

01:23:15.741 --> 01:23:18.618
Then find me, and let me know
what the hell is goin' on over there.

01:23:18.786 --> 01:23:20.662
And don't talk to anybody but me!

01:23:41.767 --> 01:23:43.976
Hold it right there, Foley,
you're under arrest.

01:23:44.144 --> 01:23:45.436
Billy, what the hell are you doin' here?

01:23:45.604 --> 01:23:46.938
I stole my gun and forced him
to bring me here.

01:23:47.106 --> 01:23:50.358
No, he didn't, Sarg. Look, everything
he said about Maitland is right.

01:23:50.526 --> 01:23:53.194
Now, he's kidnapped a woman
and he's got her in his house.

01:23:54.321 --> 01:23:55.947
Well, let's go in there and get her.

01:23:56.115 --> 01:23:57.699
What the fuck you think
I'm tryin' to do here?

01:23:57.866 --> 01:24:01.202
You're not doin' anything! We'll have
a search warrant in 20 minutes.

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:04.205
- She'll be dead in 20 minutes.
- Stop workin' on that lock.

01:24:04.373 --> 01:24:07.917
I'm gonna open this door and I'm goin'
inside. You wanna stop me? Shoot me.

01:24:10.337 --> 01:24:11.921
- Me, too.
- Billy!

01:24:12.089 --> 01:24:14.424
You can do what you want,
but I'm going in with Axel.

01:24:14.591 --> 01:24:16.926
Goddamn it, Billy,
this is really serious trouble!

01:24:17.094 --> 01:24:19.137
If you're lucky, you'll just get fired.

01:24:19.972 --> 01:24:23.182
- Got it.
- It's my last warning, Foley.

01:24:29.273 --> 01:24:33.276
- Billy!
- I'm sorry, Sarg, I've got to.

01:24:37.573 --> 01:24:40.283
Shit. Wait a minute.

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:55.006
What's that?

01:24:56.341 --> 01:24:59.177
Looks like east gate. Punch it up.

01:25:03.307 --> 01:25:05.349
Who the hell is that?

01:25:06.185 --> 01:25:07.643
Better get Maitland up here.

01:25:24.495 --> 01:25:27.163
Where is everybody?
Owensby, is Rosewood back yet?

01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:29.165
- No, sir.
- Have you seen Taggart?

01:25:29.333 --> 01:25:31.125
He took off about ten minutes ago.

01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:43.179
Foley's on the grounds.

01:25:43.347 --> 01:25:45.139
Well, how the hell should I know?

01:25:45.307 --> 01:25:47.141
Get some people out there right away.

01:25:50.103 --> 01:25:52.146
Don't take your eyes off that screen.

01:26:23.804 --> 01:26:26.138
I want you to try to locate
Taggart and Rosewood.

01:26:37.234 --> 01:26:38.442
Come on.

01:26:52.583 --> 01:26:54.250
OK, OK, OK.

01:26:56.962 --> 01:26:58.045
Shit.

01:27:02.593 --> 01:27:05.970
- They must be away from the car, sir.
- I can see that, keep trying.

01:27:07.222 --> 01:27:09.974
- DD-13, come in please.
- What's their 20?

01:27:14.646 --> 01:27:17.940
- 609 Palm Canyon Road.
- Who lives at that address?

01:27:21.862 --> 01:27:23.654
A Victor Maitland, sir.

01:27:25.073 --> 01:27:26.407
Try again.

01:27:27.326 --> 01:27:28.659
Let's go around.

01:27:29.786 --> 01:27:31.495
We can do it. Come on.

01:27:36.668 --> 01:27:37.668
Ready?

01:27:37.836 --> 01:27:39.795
One, two...

01:28:11.244 --> 01:28:12.620
You all right?

01:28:16.375 --> 01:28:18.209
What the fuck am I doin' here?

01:28:25.008 --> 01:28:26.217
Drop it!

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:37.645
- Good shot, Billy.
- Let's go.

01:28:48.573 --> 01:28:51.283
- Jesus Christ!
- Yeah, these guys are serious.

01:28:51.451 --> 01:28:53.077
I hate machine guns.

01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:04.005
Cover me.

01:29:17.477 --> 01:29:19.770
You guys go around front,
I'm gonna check the back.

01:29:22.733 --> 01:29:25.109
Sir, we have a report of shots fired
at that same location.

01:29:25.277 --> 01:29:27.278
609 Palm Canyon Road.

01:29:28.238 --> 01:29:31.240
Put out a 998: Officers need assistance.

01:29:31.408 --> 01:29:33.117
- Undercovers on the scene.
- Sir?

01:29:33.285 --> 01:29:35.786
Just do it!
I want all north end units to roll.

01:29:35.954 --> 01:29:38.330
South end units stay in their area.

01:29:38.498 --> 01:29:40.082
Damn! Let's go.

01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:42.084
Undercover officers at location.

01:29:50.844 --> 01:29:52.970
Police! You're all under arrest!

01:29:59.478 --> 01:30:02.229
You do that again,
I'll shoot you myself.

01:31:14.302 --> 01:31:16.220
You know what I keep thinking about?

01:31:17.514 --> 01:31:19.223
You know the end of Butch Cassidy?

01:31:22.727 --> 01:31:25.563
Where Redford and Newman
are almost out of ammunition.

01:31:27.858 --> 01:31:31.402
And the whole Bolivian Army
is out in front of this little hut.

01:31:33.738 --> 01:31:35.239
Billy...

01:31:36.741 --> 01:31:38.701
I'm gonna make you pay for this.

01:32:58.823 --> 01:33:00.741
- You gonna hang around here?
- Fuck no!

01:33:28.186 --> 01:33:30.312
- Freeze it!
- Hold it right there.

01:33:33.858 --> 01:33:35.150
Oh, shit.

01:33:47.872 --> 01:33:49.331
Axel!

01:33:53.586 --> 01:33:56.422
Be careful, old boy, you might hit me.

01:34:05.056 --> 01:34:06.056
Freeze!

01:34:24.075 --> 01:34:26.952
Police! You're all under arrest!

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.538
Lay down your weapons in front of you

01:34:29.706 --> 01:34:33.250
and take two steps back
with your hands up!

01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:39.548
Very good.

01:34:40.383 --> 01:34:41.592
Great.

01:35:00.737 --> 01:35:02.237
What the hell's going on here?

01:35:03.073 --> 01:35:04.114
Oh, shit.

01:35:04.282 --> 01:35:06.450
- What's this man doing here?
- Bleeding, sir.

01:35:06.618 --> 01:35:09.870
Rosewood, how come
he isn't wearing cuffs?

01:35:11.289 --> 01:35:14.416
Well, he isn't actually in custody, sir.

01:35:14.584 --> 01:35:17.294
Well, place him in custody,
or would you like me to do it?

01:35:17.462 --> 01:35:19.713
Wouldn't you like to hear
my report first, sir?

01:35:22.133 --> 01:35:24.843
You have a report
that explains all this?

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:26.804
Yes, sir.

01:35:28.264 --> 01:35:31.308
Well, I will be very glad to hear it.

01:35:34.145 --> 01:35:38.107
Ms. Jeannette Summers, the manager
of Mr. Maitland's art gallery,

01:35:38.274 --> 01:35:40.776
accidentally discovered large quantities
of a substance

01:35:40.944 --> 01:35:43.987
she suspected was cocaine
in the art gallery's warehouse.

01:35:44.155 --> 01:35:47.157
She immediately communicated her
discovery to Detective Axel Foley

01:35:47.325 --> 01:35:48.659
of the Detroit Police Force.

01:35:50.537 --> 01:35:53.455
Detective Foley was,
at the time, cooperating

01:35:53.623 --> 01:35:57.334
in a joint Beverly Hills-Detroit
investigation of narcotics trafficking.

01:35:57.502 --> 01:36:01.088
Detectives Foley and Rosewood,
responding to Ms. Summers' report,

01:36:01.256 --> 01:36:03.715
proceeded to the warehouse,
where Rosewood did, in fact,

01:36:03.883 --> 01:36:06.427
discover approximately
80 kilos of cocaine.

01:36:07.512 --> 01:36:09.680
Rosewood immediately
called for backup.

01:36:09.848 --> 01:36:11.849
And I dispatched our officers
to this location.

01:36:12.016 --> 01:36:15.310
Sergeant Taggart here,
was the first to arrive at the scene.

01:36:15.478 --> 01:36:19.022
And having probable cause to
believe a felony was in progress,

01:36:19.190 --> 01:36:22.526
Sergeant Taggart joined Rosewood,
with Detective Foley

01:36:22.694 --> 01:36:26.447
present only as an observer,
and proceeded to enter the grounds.

01:36:26.614 --> 01:36:28.282
And in the course
of defending ourselves,

01:36:28.450 --> 01:36:31.535
we shot several suspects,
including Mr. Maitland.

01:36:36.249 --> 01:36:39.001
You expect me to believe that report?

01:36:40.295 --> 01:36:42.129
That's the report I'm filing, sir.

01:36:45.383 --> 01:36:46.884
Sergeant Taggart...

01:36:47.969 --> 01:36:49.970
Why don't you tell me what happened?

01:37:03.443 --> 01:37:05.777
Happened just like
the lieutenant said, chief.

01:37:18.791 --> 01:37:23.545
Well, I suppose
congratulations are in order.

01:37:25.465 --> 01:37:27.216
Thank you, sir.

01:37:27.383 --> 01:37:30.260
That report better be
on my desk in the morning.

01:37:30.428 --> 01:37:32.262
Yes, sir, first thing.

01:37:40.772 --> 01:37:43.357
You were lyin' your ass off.

01:37:46.778 --> 01:37:49.821
Why don't you go to the hospital
and get your shoulder looked at?

01:37:51.115 --> 01:37:52.491
Excuse me, sir.

01:37:57.956 --> 01:38:00.666
I was wondering if you could,
like, do me a favor, sir?

01:38:01.918 --> 01:38:05.379
- I think your favors are all used up.
- I understand.

01:38:05.547 --> 01:38:08.840
It's just that I was hopin'
you could call my Inspector Todd,

01:38:09.008 --> 01:38:12.302
my boss back home and straighten
things out, but that's all right.

01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:14.388
Guess I'm out of a job.
It's cool, though.

01:38:14.556 --> 01:38:16.890
I think I'm gonna stay in Beverly Hills.
I like it here.

01:38:17.058 --> 01:38:19.518
I'm gonna start my own
private investigation company.

01:38:19.686 --> 01:38:21.061
How's that sound?

01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:23.689
I will talk to Inspector Todd
first thing tomorrow.

01:38:23.856 --> 01:38:25.357
- Will you, really?
- Yes, you bet.

01:38:25.525 --> 01:38:27.776
- Thank you so much, sir.
- You're welcome.

01:38:34.909 --> 01:38:37.953
How you doin'? I'm Axel Foley,
checkin' out of suite 1035.

01:38:38.121 --> 01:38:40.622
One moment, sir.
I'll get your bill.

01:38:43.751 --> 01:38:45.502
Hey! Guys!

01:38:45.670 --> 01:38:48.964
You all didn't have to see me off.
But I'm very moved by the gesture.

01:38:49.132 --> 01:38:52.718
Bogomil ordered us
to make sure you got out of town.

01:38:54.053 --> 01:38:56.513
You know, that doesn't even matter
to me, Billy. You know what matters?

01:38:56.681 --> 01:38:57.973
That you guys came down here.

01:38:58.141 --> 01:39:01.184
I'm all choked up on the inside.
I got a lump in my throat.

01:39:01.352 --> 01:39:04.146
You look a little misty yourself there,
Taggart.

01:39:04.314 --> 01:39:06.148
- There you go, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

01:39:06.316 --> 01:39:10.193
Excuse me. The Beverly Hills Police
Department is picking that up.

01:39:10.361 --> 01:39:12.446
Oh, get outta here! Guys!

01:39:12.614 --> 01:39:16.116
That's the last straw. That was
the last straw, you guys are too nice.

01:39:16.284 --> 01:39:19.077
Sir, do you sell those
Beverly Palm robes down here?

01:39:19.245 --> 01:39:21.038
Yes, we do sir,
they're $95 apiece.

01:39:21.205 --> 01:39:23.123
Money is no object, put 'em on my tab.

01:39:23.291 --> 01:39:24.916
I have to have two of them, though.

01:39:27.045 --> 01:39:30.756
Billy, you saved my life, OK?

01:39:30.923 --> 01:39:32.883
I don't think I'll ever
be able to repay you.

01:39:33.051 --> 01:39:34.593
But as a token of my appreciation,

01:39:34.761 --> 01:39:37.346
I want you to have this
fine Beverly Palm robe.

01:39:37.513 --> 01:39:39.181
Each time you get out of the shower
and you're dripping wet,

01:39:39.349 --> 01:39:41.892
for the rest of your life, I want you
to think about our friendship.

01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:44.936
I want you to think about Axel Foley.
I love you, Billy.

01:39:49.317 --> 01:39:50.734
Thanks, Axel.

01:39:52.028 --> 01:39:56.365
Here, let me take this.
You should rest that arm.

01:39:56.532 --> 01:39:58.700
Billy, take care of the tab, would you?

01:39:59.535 --> 01:40:01.662
- Hey, Taggart.
- Here you are, sir.

01:40:01.829 --> 01:40:03.580
This is for you.

01:40:03.748 --> 01:40:06.583
No, that's all right.
You keep it as a souvenir.

01:40:08.503 --> 01:40:10.504
I already have three of 'em in my bag.

01:40:14.926 --> 01:40:16.385
- Here you go.
- Thank you, sir.

01:40:16.552 --> 01:40:18.387
- Take it easy.
- You're not gonna say goodbye?

01:40:19.597 --> 01:40:22.224
Why, ain't you guys gonna tail me
to the city limits, anyway?

01:40:22.392 --> 01:40:25.936
- Yes, we are.
- I figured you would.

01:40:26.104 --> 01:40:28.355
I was thinking about stopping off
and getting something to drink, though.

01:40:28.523 --> 01:40:30.565
Yeah, we sorta figured you would.

01:40:30.733 --> 01:40:32.109
That mean you guys
are gonna join me?

01:40:32.276 --> 01:40:35.654
I don't think so, Axel,
we're still on duty.

01:40:36.906 --> 01:40:40.117
Well, I don't think one beer's
gonna kill us, Billy.

01:40:40.284 --> 01:40:43.370
That's right, listen to Taggart here.
Lighten up, all right?

01:40:43.538 --> 01:40:45.580
One drink's not gonna kill us.

01:40:47.333 --> 01:40:48.875
Hey, guys...

01:40:49.043 --> 01:40:51.628
If you fall too far behind,
don't be afraid to honk, OK?

01:40:51.796 --> 01:40:53.463
Where we goin' anyway?

01:40:53.631 --> 01:40:56.091
Don't worry about it,
just follow my lead.

01:40:56.259 --> 01:40:58.635
I know the perfect place.
You guys will love it.

01:40:58.803 --> 01:41:00.053
Trust me.
