we're not allowed outside
during recess.

06:19.121 --> 06:20.862
They're gonna shoot
a drone video of the school.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.123
Oh! That's why
they won't let us outside?

06:23.258 --> 06:24.699
A secret drone shot?

06:24.793 --> 06:26.776
They're worried we're gonna
moon the drone or something?

06:26.795 --> 06:28.035
Yeah, so we're gonna do that.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.279
Or something better. You in?

06:29.297 --> 06:30.964
-Hecks yeah.
-Let's do a dance.

06:31.116 --> 06:32.908
-[groans]
-It's an overhead drone shot.

06:32.910 --> 06:34.876
Those were invented
for filming dance.

-And for war.
-You guys doing a dance

Guys, I'm not sure
about the dancing.

06:40.308 --> 06:42.049
What? Why? It's dancing.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.476
Adults will notice dancing.

06:43.629 --> 06:45.478
We have to be unseen
by the naked eye

06:45.631 --> 06:47.647
so they'll actually use it
on the website.

with all the school play props,

we grab the bushes
and the fog machine

07:00.904 --> 07:03.146
that they used in that play,
<i> Bushes and Fog.</i>

07:03.148 --> 07:04.756
Wasn't our best play...

07:04.983 --> 07:05.757
And we're gonna use the bushes

07:05.909 --> 07:07.000
to form the school's "butt,"

07:07.152 --> 07:08.910
if you will,
and we're gonna use

07:09.004 --> 07:10.320
the fog machine
to make it look like

07:10.489 --> 07:11.746
the school's butt is farting.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.323
But to
the unsophisticated adults,

07:13.416 --> 07:15.158
it'll just look like
some shrubbery and a bit of,

07:15.251 --> 07:18.252
-uh... low-hanging cloud.
-The school farting?

07:18.272 --> 07:20.163
It's elegant, provocative.

07:20.332 --> 07:21.589
But this could be the one chance

07:21.683 --> 07:23.775
we ever have to do
a dance for a drone.

07:23.927 --> 07:25.685
I'm with J-Ju. I say we dance,

07:25.837 --> 07:28.888
and just be like, we're here
in this moment, truly alive.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.598
Guys, if we don't make
the website

07:30.617 --> 07:31.691
and cement our legacy,

07:31.843 --> 07:32.934
what's the point of any of this?

07:33.028 --> 07:34.286
Don't you want
to be remembered as

07:34.437 --> 07:36.696
incognito,
school-flatulating legends?

07:36.865 --> 07:38.031
You had me at flatulating.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.125
I guess I could get into
being a legend.

07:40.276 --> 07:42.127
Move over, John L... Legend.

07:42.278 --> 07:43.611
-Okay.
-Let's do it.
-I'm in.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.355
All right. We'll meet
in the cafeteria at lunch.

07:45.448 --> 07:46.873
-Go!
-And think of a cool codename

07:46.967 --> 07:48.783
for yourself
to add to the mystique.

07:48.877 --> 07:50.135
Mine's Treat Williams--

07:50.286 --> 07:53.096
No, no, no, no. Admiral Lasagna.

07:53.882 --> 07:55.865
-Linda!
-Teddy! Ooh.

07:55.884 --> 07:57.867
-Does it look bad?
-No.

07:57.961 --> 07:59.311
No... No!

07:59.462 --> 08:01.128
Sorry, it's a little messy.

08:01.223 --> 08:02.481
Is that a bag of salt?

08:02.632 --> 08:03.648
Oh, yeah, that's where
the salt went.

08:03.875 --> 08:06.467
[sighs] Could we maybe...

08:06.561 --> 08:07.652
stop by the job site
and get my truck

08:07.879 --> 08:09.136
to pick up Kathleen?

08:09.156 --> 08:11.323
Wait, wha? Aren't you worried
about being late?

08:11.399 --> 08:13.399
It's on our way!
And, you know, I cleaned it

08:13.494 --> 08:15.142
and it has the pillows
and snacks

08:15.162 --> 08:18.054
and the, "Yay, you got
your colonoscopy!" mixtape.

08:18.073 --> 08:19.405
And, uh, no ants.

08:19.558 --> 08:21.074
Yeah, okay. Okay.

08:21.226 --> 08:22.742
[entry bell jangles]

08:22.836 --> 08:24.744
Hi. Welcome to Bob's Burgers.

08:24.838 --> 08:25.987
-Hi.
-Hi. Hello.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.564
Have a seat.
I'll get you some menus.

08:27.582 --> 08:29.466
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.252
[whispering in Arabic]

08:33.162 --> 08:35.830
[Bob]
<i> Hmm. Are they</i>
<i> whispering about me?</i>

08:35.849 --> 08:37.015
[all whispering in Arabic]

08:37.166 --> 08:38.091
[Bob]
<i> Mm, yep.</i>

08:38.243 --> 08:39.576
[whispering continues]

08:39.594 --> 08:42.628
-Is everything... okay?
-Yes. Thank you.

08:42.781 --> 08:45.565
All right. Take your time.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.319
[all whispering in Arabic]

08:53.367 --> 08:55.700
[Bob]
<i> Hmm, no-no boogers.</i>

08:55.927 --> 08:58.370
<i> Mustache is relatively clean.</i>

08:58.446 --> 08:59.445
[sniffs]

08:59.598 --> 09:01.581
[Bob]
<i> Usual armpit smell.</i>

09:02.450 --> 09:04.100
<i> Hm.</i>

09:04.119 --> 09:06.436
Thank you. I got an update
from the clinic.

09:06.529 --> 09:09.030
Kathleen is in
the recovery room. Recovering.

09:09.107 --> 09:10.623
Already? Oh, boy. Okay.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.050
Gonna go a little faster.

09:12.201 --> 09:14.052
Yeah, but not over
the speed limit, right?

09:14.203 --> 09:16.370
No. Just maybe... ten over,

09:16.390 --> 09:18.390
-12 over, 15 over.
-[groans]

09:18.617 --> 09:20.450
Teddy, 15 miles
over the speed limit

09:20.468 --> 09:21.968
is still, technically,
the speed limit.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.728
They factor in
for that sort of thing.

09:23.955 --> 09:25.138
-[police siren wails]
-And...

09:25.290 --> 09:26.731
there's a siren. That's bad.

09:26.883 --> 09:28.641
Ooh!
Are we getting pulled over?

09:28.794 --> 09:30.402
Do we gun it? Should I gun it?
Should we go?!

09:30.553 --> 09:31.552
Linda, no!

09:31.630 --> 09:33.071
[Linda]
<i> Right, right.</i>

09:34.575 --> 09:36.575
Okay, one at a time,
we should slip out

09:36.760 --> 09:38.076
and meet in the storage room.

09:38.227 --> 09:40.653
Ugh! What if we started turning
like a human pinwheel?

09:40.747 --> 09:42.730
That would look
so cool from up above.

09:42.899 --> 09:44.324
Love it. Busby Berkeley?

09:44.418 --> 09:46.734
More like Busby
You-Gotta-Be-Berserk-ly

09:46.753 --> 09:48.235
not to be inspired by that idea.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.570
Human pinwheel does sound fun.

09:49.664 --> 09:51.481
I've always wanted to be
part of a human something.

09:51.574 --> 09:53.149
-No, no, no.
-Not that we're doing dancing,

09:53.168 --> 09:55.151
but if we were,
what would the song be?

09:55.170 --> 09:56.744
"I Think We're A Drone Now?"

09:56.838 --> 09:58.930
No, Gene! Finish food. Do plan.

09:59.082 --> 10:01.933
Ah! I will finish my food,
thank you very much.

10:02.085 --> 10:03.768
And whoever else's food
needs finishing.

10:03.920 --> 10:06.438
-Fine.
-You're welcome!

10:07.332 --> 10:08.589
-[Teddy] Uh...
-[Linda] Oh, boy.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.850
[Teddy]
Oh, God.
Oh, God, we're gonna be late!

10:11.002 --> 10:13.519
-You know how fast you were--
-Uh, sorry I was speeding,
Officer.

10:13.672 --> 10:15.113
I've never driven
this truck before.

10:15.264 --> 10:16.506
But not because I stole it.

10:16.524 --> 10:17.932
It's his truck.
He just can't drive it.

10:18.026 --> 10:19.859
Right now.
'Cause he's all messed up.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.453
-I mean, look at him.
-Hi.

10:21.604 --> 10:23.622
Uh-huh. License and
registration, please.

10:23.849 --> 10:24.772
Okay.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.516
Uh, officer,
we're late to pick up

10:26.534 --> 10:28.685
Teddy's special friend.
Uh, this is Teddy.

10:28.703 --> 10:31.371
She asked him to be the one to
pick her up from her colonoscopy

10:31.465 --> 10:33.022
-and it's kind of a big deal.
-[officer] Wait.

10:33.157 --> 10:35.208
You're picking someone up
from a colonoscopy?

10:35.302 --> 10:37.861
-Yes.
-It's the thing when they put
the camera up your--

10:37.879 --> 10:39.362
Oh, I know what it is.

10:39.455 --> 10:41.030
A colonoscopy saved
my nana's life.

10:41.049 --> 10:42.974
And I was the one
who picked her up.

10:43.201 --> 10:44.309
-Oh.
-Oh, okay.

10:44.460 --> 10:46.460
Yeah. She's my best friend.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.037
-Wow, that's nice.
-Great. That's great.

10:48.131 --> 10:50.039
You know what?
I'm gonna give you an escort.

10:50.133 --> 10:52.709
-An escort? A police escort?
-Seriously?

10:52.727 --> 10:54.560
You're doing a good thing.
And giving escorts

10:54.655 --> 10:55.879
is my favorite part of the job.

10:55.972 --> 10:57.304
It's kind of why I became a cop.

10:57.399 --> 10:58.973
Where's your friend
getting her colonoscopy?

10:58.992 --> 11:01.217
-The Main Street Medical Center.
-Well, all right.

11:01.219 --> 11:02.552
Let the escort begin!

11:02.570 --> 11:04.237
-Thank you, Officer!
-Yeah, thank you!

11:04.389 --> 11:06.831
I always wanted one of these.
A nice male escort.

11:06.983 --> 11:09.483
-[siren wailing]
-[Teddy] Wow.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.318
Uh, I think we're actually
gonna make it on time.

11:11.413 --> 11:13.079
-You bet we are--
-[grunts]

11:13.231 --> 11:15.081
-Oh, my God.
-No, no, no...

11:15.233 --> 11:17.734
-You hit me!
-I'm sorry. Why did you stop?

11:17.752 --> 11:19.085
There was a car in front of me.

11:19.237 --> 11:20.679
We're not supposed
to smash into those!

11:20.830 --> 11:22.588
-[siren wailing in distance]
-Okay, that's a good reason.

11:22.741 --> 11:23.831
Oh, no. It's the cops.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.183
Don't tell him I was
giving you an escort.

11:25.334 --> 11:27.093
-What?
-Don't tell. I'll get in

11:27.245 --> 11:28.853
so much trouble. Shh.

11:29.005 --> 11:30.689
[groans nervously]

11:35.253 --> 11:36.602
-Oh, my God, oh, my god.
-[whispering] Just lie for me.

11:36.771 --> 11:38.271
-What? Lie to a cop?
-It's fine, it's fine,

11:38.365 --> 11:40.773
people do it all the time.
Just tell him you rear-ended me,

11:40.867 --> 11:44.110
-but don't say anything
about the escort.
-Eh...

11:44.187 --> 11:45.686
Everything okay, Earl?

11:45.706 --> 11:48.097
Yeah, yeah. Uh, this, uh,
person that I've never met

11:48.116 --> 11:50.375
until this very moment
just rear-ended me.

11:50.526 --> 11:53.102
Uh, that's right,
I just plowed right into him--

11:53.196 --> 11:54.454
into the police car.

11:54.606 --> 11:57.048
Hmm. And where were you
headed so fast, ma'am?

11:57.200 --> 11:59.217
Oh, I was, uh...

11:59.368 --> 12:02.295
I was going to go...
have an affair. With that guy.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.871
-Yeah. So, I was in a hurry
-[grunting]

12:03.890 --> 12:05.798
-to cheat on my husband.
-What?

12:05.951 --> 12:08.134
-Well, I for one believe that.
-Are you all right, sir?

12:08.228 --> 12:09.953
-I've been better.
-He got stung by a bee,

12:10.046 --> 12:12.379
and he drove a nail into
his foot, and he bit his lip.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.973
But, uh, that's how I like 'em.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.291
This is all my fault!

12:15.384 --> 12:16.626
It's my friend,

12:16.719 --> 12:18.311
she asked me to pick her up
after her colonoscopy.

12:18.463 --> 12:20.721
-A colonoscopy, huh?
-Oh, God.

12:20.890 --> 12:22.315
-Earl?
-Uh...

12:22.467 --> 12:23.891
Where's the dang fog machine?

12:23.985 --> 12:25.726
I haven't the<i> foggiest.</i> Sorry.

12:25.746 --> 12:28.654
Louise, maybe the bush butt
doesn't need to fart?

12:28.807 --> 12:29.989
Listen to yourself, Tina,

12:30.141 --> 12:31.565
of course
the bush butt needs to fart.

12:31.659 --> 12:33.659
-What are you doing?
-Choreography. Just in case

12:33.736 --> 12:36.254
-we decide to bust out
some moves.
-No!

12:36.481 --> 12:38.014
We may not be able
to help ourselves.

12:38.074 --> 12:39.832
-[grunting]
-All right! We're dancing!

12:39.926 --> 12:41.575
-Zeke, ow!
-I'm dancing!

12:41.595 --> 12:43.987
-[Jimmy Jr.] Ow, Zeke!
Too much, too much!
-Ugh.

12:44.005 --> 12:45.338
Here you go.

12:45.490 --> 12:47.248
Uh, anyone need anything else?

12:47.267 --> 12:49.934
-More coffee?
-Uh, we're good. Thanks.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.770
We just came from
our mom's funeral next door.

12:51.921 --> 12:54.773
Oh. Uh, I'm-I'm so sorry
for your loss.

12:54.941 --> 12:55.999
Thank you.

12:56.017 --> 12:58.851
-Uh... the thing is...
-Yeah?

12:59.020 --> 13:00.169
-You smell like our dead mom.
-Oh.

13:00.188 --> 13:03.022
Sorry. I know that must
sound very strange.

13:03.174 --> 13:04.783
[speaking Arabic]

13:04.934 --> 13:07.101
He says you<i> really</i> smell like
our mom.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.362
[both speaking Arabic]

13:10.290 --> 13:13.016
He, uh, he was wondering
if you know why?

13:13.109 --> 13:16.294
I, uh, uh, great question.
Uh, do you mind if I

13:16.445 --> 13:18.279
-call my wife real quick?
-Please.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.039
-Of course.
-I'll be right back.

13:20.191 --> 13:21.357
Sorry about all this.

13:21.450 --> 13:23.026
-The paperwork alone...
-[phone buzzing]

13:23.044 --> 13:24.043
Hello? Hi, Bob.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.212
Lin, hi.
D-Do you know why I might smell

13:26.364 --> 13:27.713
like an old, dead woman?

13:27.808 --> 13:29.699
What? You just have to floss,
Bob. I told you--

13:29.792 --> 13:32.126
No. A family came in
after a funeral for their mom,

13:32.145 --> 13:35.313
and the dad thinks
I smell like his late wife.

13:35.540 --> 13:36.722
-Oh.
-Linda?

13:36.875 --> 13:38.891
-Yeah?
-The dumpster you got
the shampoo from--

13:38.985 --> 13:41.210
tell me the truth, Lin.
Was it Mort's dumpster?

13:41.229 --> 13:44.063
Did I wash my hair
with a dead woman's shampoo?

13:44.140 --> 13:45.398
Yeah... Sorry.

13:45.567 --> 13:47.066
Sometimes families
give Mort stuff

13:47.160 --> 13:48.568
so he can make their loved ones

13:48.662 --> 13:50.236
look as close to how they looked
when they were alive,

13:50.330 --> 13:52.479
and he puts all the stuff he
doesn't use out by the dumpsters

13:52.648 --> 13:55.149
and sometimes, if it's nice,
I, you know, I grab it.

13:55.243 --> 13:56.501
-Oh, my God.
-Bob, I got to go.

13:56.652 --> 13:58.002
We're running super late
'cause of the cops.

13:58.154 --> 14:00.746
-Cops? Why are there cops?
-It's fine, it's fine.

14:00.823 --> 14:03.232
-Goodbye.
-Uh, well, that's it.

14:03.326 --> 14:04.825
I called Muriel-- the cousin.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.919
She's gonna pick up Kathleen.

14:07.072 --> 14:08.829
Oh, Teddy, I'm so sorry.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.573
I'm sorry we got pulled over.

14:10.666 --> 14:13.834
But we really tried.
Kathleen will understand.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.502
It's not that. I know she will.

14:15.597 --> 14:19.173
It's just, I guess all of this
meant a lot to... me.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.025
To be able to do this for her.

14:21.177 --> 14:23.102
It's good for the heart,
to do nice stuff.

14:23.179 --> 14:25.088
And I felt lucky

14:25.106 --> 14:27.273
to have the chance to do it.
I just...

14:27.367 --> 14:29.200
[sighs] I care about her a lot.

14:29.427 --> 14:31.369
[sighs]
Aw, Teddy, you're so sweet.

14:31.596 --> 14:33.112
Okay, we're gonna
figure this out.

14:33.264 --> 14:35.114
You call off the cousin,
I'll deal with the fuzz.

14:35.266 --> 14:36.599
-It's just the theatre of it--
-Officers?

14:36.618 --> 14:38.025
I'm really sorry
about the fender bender

14:38.119 --> 14:39.285
and the speeding.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.953
