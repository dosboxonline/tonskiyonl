WEBVTT

00:38.588 --> 00:39.681
Beautiful.

00:39.681 --> 00:42.487
Focus more on the arm whip
than wrist snap, okay?

00:43.893 --> 00:45.424
It'll give you more velocity.

00:48.559 --> 00:49.824
I had a long talk
with Mom this morning.

00:51.364 --> 00:53.432
She said your bad dreams
are getting worse.

00:55.132 --> 00:57.038
She also said

00:57.038 --> 00:58.701
there was something
you needed to tell me.

01:00.338 --> 01:02.339
Remember... Remember that day

01:02.339 --> 01:05.211
you let me ride my bike
to practice?

01:05.211 --> 01:07.174
You rode through
the storm drain, didn't you?

01:07.174 --> 01:08.579
By the old mine.

01:09.313 --> 01:10.482
Why? Did something happen?

01:11.447 --> 01:13.285
No. Nothing happened, Dad.

01:13.285 --> 01:15.586
I just freaked myself out a bit.
That's all.

01:18.461 --> 01:20.591
Is that why you
started carrying around
Bunny Bear again?

01:25.999 --> 01:27.528
Before you say no,

01:27.528 --> 01:29.235
Mom thinks
one way of tackling this

01:29.235 --> 01:31.301
is for you to let go
of some of the things

01:31.301 --> 01:33.373
you needed
when you were little.

01:34.972 --> 01:36.473
I agree.

01:36.473 --> 01:39.780
But we also agree
that when that happens,

01:39.780 --> 01:41.150
it's entirely up to you.

01:43.448 --> 01:44.513
Let me toss the gear
in the shed,

01:44.513 --> 01:45.616
and then we can
go grab some pizza.

02:29.026 --> 02:30.232
Dad?

02:37.768 --> 02:38.669
Dad?

02:40.172 --> 02:41.375
Dad, are you in there?

02:44.547 --> 02:45.610
Dad?

03:08.069 --> 03:09.969
Dad?

03:09.969 --> 03:11.202
Dad, what's happening?

03:11.202 --> 03:12.736
Dad!

03:13.736 --> 03:15.204
Run!

03:15.204 --> 03:16.707
No!

05:40.116 --> 05:42.917

05:57.566 --> 05:59.308
Five more minutes. Okay, dude?

05:59.308 --> 06:01.370
I thought we said
no more <i>Bunny Hop.</i>

06:02.704 --> 06:04.439
It's better than
<i>Little Baby Bum.</i>

06:07.046 --> 06:08.048
Hey.

06:08.048 --> 06:10.083
Hey, babe. You look awful.

06:10.083 --> 06:11.915
You look like a waffle.

06:15.720 --> 06:18.087
Yeah, well,
I didn't sleep for shit.

06:18.087 --> 06:20.388
I thought you said you were
gonna stop working so late.

06:20.388 --> 06:22.426
It wasn't that.

06:22.426 --> 06:23.559
There were deer or something

06:23.559 --> 06:25.632
- in the backyard again.
- Hmm.

06:26.430 --> 06:27.436
What time is it?

06:28.936 --> 06:30.439
10:17.

06:31.235 --> 06:32.401
Why?

06:32.401 --> 06:33.873
Oh, I don't know.

06:33.873 --> 06:35.070
My sister?

06:36.078 --> 06:37.076
Liam and the girls?

06:37.076 --> 06:38.612
11:00 a.m. brunch?

06:39.578 --> 06:41.577
Family brunch.

06:41.577 --> 06:43.914
Okay. I am going to shower.

06:45.288 --> 06:46.851
Come on.

06:49.719 --> 06:52.589
You're a zombie.
You're a zombie.

06:52.589 --> 06:54.756
I'm gonna... Come.
I'll get you!

06:54.756 --> 06:55.890
You're gonna
give him nightmares.

06:55.890 --> 06:57.562
You're a zombie!
Please, he loves it.

06:57.562 --> 06:58.560
Don't you, <i>ti cheri?</i>

06:58.560 --> 07:00.967
Yes, let Auntie eat you!

07:02.665 --> 07:04.435
Was there a blackout
last night?

07:04.435 --> 07:07.268
Uh, no,
not that I know of. Why?

07:07.268 --> 07:10.006
Clocks are all out of whack,
and the fridge is defrosted.

07:11.046 --> 07:11.942
Oh!

07:14.113 --> 07:15.481
Oh, wow.

07:15.481 --> 07:17.215
Yeah, the place
looks amazing, Karina.

07:17.215 --> 07:18.316
Thank you, Arlene.

07:18.316 --> 07:20.251
Yeah, it's getting there.

07:20.251 --> 07:21.182
Yeah, it's great.

07:23.555 --> 07:24.823
It's so not getting there.

07:25.356 --> 07:26.754
Mmm.

07:26.754 --> 07:28.563
It was probably just a possum.

07:30.126 --> 07:32.193
I caught one under my grill
the other night.

07:33.201 --> 07:34.729
Almost shat myself.

07:34.729 --> 07:36.131
It sounded like
a person to me.

07:37.504 --> 07:38.833
Then it was kids
drinking forties

07:38.833 --> 07:39.904
in the woods like
we used to do.

07:40.869 --> 07:42.973
It sounded like one person.

07:44.676 --> 07:45.679
Got a gun in the house?

07:46.378 --> 07:48.416
Are you nuts?

07:48.416 --> 07:50.346
All Dad ever needed
was his Henry Aaron.

07:52.020 --> 07:53.522
Different era, my friend.

07:58.259 --> 07:59.055
Hey, check this out.

08:03.961 --> 08:06.667
Finally got the mechanics
working perfect.

08:13.908 --> 08:17.478
My loan agent might be willing
to give me an extension.

08:17.478 --> 08:21.011
But only if I cut
production costs by half.

08:24.953 --> 08:26.248
I, uh...

08:26.248 --> 08:29.183
You know, I thought we agreed
you were gonna let that go.

08:29.183 --> 08:31.021
That you were gonna
get those loans paid off.

08:39.601 --> 08:42.837
Whatever you say, boss.

08:42.837 --> 08:45.607
<i>So how's Pat doing with
the move back to New Jersey?</i>

08:46.206 --> 08:47.208
Stressed.

08:47.208 --> 08:48.907
- Mmm.
- Barely sleeping.

08:49.808 --> 08:50.706
It killed him
to come back here

08:50.706 --> 08:51.941
and take the job with Liam,

08:51.941 --> 08:54.312
but the reality
is he couldn't find anyone

08:54.312 --> 08:56.044
to fund his designs.

08:56.044 --> 08:58.484
Our medical benefits
are about to expire.

08:58.484 --> 08:59.849
If his mom
hadn't moved to Arizona,

08:59.849 --> 09:01.816
we would be
at the YMCA right now.

09:01.816 --> 09:03.222
Ahh!

09:03.222 --> 09:05.021
Hey, honey.

09:05.021 --> 09:07.761
Please, please don't play
Fute so loud. Okay?

10:44.755 --> 10:45.925
Screw this.

10:59.937 --> 11:01.171
Hey, listen.

11:05.244 --> 11:07.375
It's fine with me if you guys
are partying out here.

11:15.319 --> 11:17.491
But don't blame me
if I bash someone's face in

11:17.491 --> 11:18.727
'cause you don't
wanna get caught.

11:33.603 --> 11:34.435
Shit.

11:36.407 --> 11:37.273
Oh, my God.

12:15.483 --> 12:16.312
Listen, Patty.

12:18.921 --> 12:21.550
I know you're still down
about how things played out,

12:21.550 --> 12:24.023
but you should be proud
that you had the balls
to go for it.

12:24.923 --> 12:26.256
Be careful what you wish for.

12:27.831 --> 12:30.128
Remember when I took over
the yard after Dad died?

12:31.667 --> 12:33.435
Had nightmares
every goddamn night

12:33.435 --> 12:36.701
about them
repossessing our car

12:36.701 --> 12:38.004
or foreclosing on the house.

12:40.610 --> 12:42.041
Those are my good dreams,
Liam.

12:46.681 --> 12:49.315
Ever since we moved back home,

12:49.315 --> 12:51.820
I've been having
these white-knucklers about
Jake getting snatched.

12:52.850 --> 12:54.149
We're in the backyard.

12:54.149 --> 12:58.153
Or maybe it's a park
or a playground.

12:58.153 --> 13:00.290
I just get this bad feeling,
you know?

13:01.730 --> 13:03.326
You know
who I blame for that shit?

13:12.236 --> 13:13.809
Yeah, I could really
use him right now.

13:14.407 --> 13:15.772
Yeah.

13:15.772 --> 13:17.307
You and me both, brother.

13:20.815 --> 13:22.312
Meet me over
at the kiln in 20.

13:23.218 --> 13:24.215
Yeah.

13:30.590 --> 13:33.026
<i>Can you
please stop doing that
for three seconds?</i>

13:35.028 --> 13:36.292
This is Irish Walnut.

13:36.292 --> 13:37.931
If I leave it for too long,
it'll get chalky.

13:37.931 --> 13:39.499
I don't care
if it's Scottish scrotum.

13:39.499 --> 13:40.929
We're on a mission here.

13:42.464 --> 13:44.202
Dad always says
to never come down here.

13:44.202 --> 13:46.302
"Dad always said
never to come down here."

13:46.302 --> 13:48.505
You're just scared of what
might be inside there.

13:51.042 --> 13:53.846
Liam, have you ever thought...

13:53.846 --> 13:55.345
What if the things
they say are true?

13:56.147 --> 13:57.983
Don't be a moron.

13:57.983 --> 14:00.350
I hate to be the one
to tell you this, but...

14:01.355 --> 14:02.352
Bingo!

14:11.228 --> 14:12.901
Okay, we saw it.
Can we go home now?

14:14.097 --> 14:15.101
I dare you to go over there.

14:16.703 --> 14:17.937
I double dare you.

14:17.937 --> 14:19.237
Or I'll tell everybody
what a pussy you were.

14:20.070 --> 14:21.136
I triple dare you to do it.

14:21.136 --> 14:22.436
I already did it,
like, 10 times.

14:22.436 --> 14:23.739
Then you shouldn't
be afraid to do it again.

14:23.739 --> 14:24.605
Should you?

14:40.825 --> 14:42.062
I wanna go home.

14:42.792 --> 14:43.998
Yeah.

14:44.961 --> 14:46.132
Yeah, me too.

14:47.798 --> 14:48.629
Holy crap.

14:51.236 --> 14:53.371
- That's a wild plum tree.
- Who cares?

14:53.371 --> 14:55.770
Grandpa said
it's the softest wood
in the entire world.

14:55.770 --> 14:56.637
Patty.

14:59.908 --> 15:01.114
Pat.

15:02.911 --> 15:04.117
Pat!

15:05.280 --> 15:06.580
Get away from there, Patty.

15:06.580 --> 15:08.116
Help me
pull this tree down first.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.518
No frickin' way.

15:09.518 --> 15:10.990
I'm not leaving
until I get a piece!

15:10.990 --> 15:12.353
If you don't let go right now,

15:12.353 --> 15:13.695
I'm totally telling Dad
we came here.

15:13.695 --> 15:15.895
- Dude. You're the pussy.
- Screw you.

15:15.895 --> 15:17.365
I'm leaving
if you don't get away...

15:23.132 --> 15:24.372
Sweet.

15:24.372 --> 15:25.571
You're too close.

15:25.571 --> 15:27.008
Seriously, Patty.

15:41.284 --> 15:42.452
Almost got it.

16:16.023 --> 16:17.886
- Are you holding on?
- Yes, I am.

16:17.886 --> 16:19.453
Okay, good.

16:19.453 --> 16:21.527
How many more times
you wanna do it?

16:21.527 --> 16:22.663
One thousand.

16:22.663 --> 16:24.491
- I gotta stop, okay?
- Again.

16:24.491 --> 16:26.534
No. I know you want
to go again, baby,

16:26.534 --> 16:27.497
but I have to work, okay?

16:28.031 --> 16:29.130
Stop.

16:29.130 --> 16:31.839
All right. I know.

16:31.839 --> 16:33.603
Come on, then.
Let's go over here.

16:33.603 --> 16:35.805
So maybe we can go when Daddy
gets back from work, okay?

16:35.805 --> 16:36.704
Okay.

16:48.388 --> 16:49.519
Jakie.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.361
Jakie, stop.

16:58.430 --> 17:00.035
I said stop!

17:03.065 --> 17:04.369
I'm sorry.

17:05.734 --> 17:08.335
Mommy just needs
some quiet for a bit. Okay?

17:08.335 --> 17:09.539
Can you do that for me, please?

17:10.975 --> 17:12.245
Okay.

17:13.042 --> 17:14.313
Thank you.

17:47.110 --> 17:48.116
Jake?

17:50.782 --> 17:51.949
Jake?

17:51.949 --> 17:53.583
Jakie, where are you?

17:55.787 --> 17:56.652
Jake?

17:59.956 --> 18:01.096
Jakie?

18:02.427 --> 18:04.027
If you don't come out
in three seconds,

18:04.027 --> 18:05.430
no dessert tonight, okay?

18:09.999 --> 18:10.798
Jakie?

18:12.441 --> 18:13.504
Jakie?

18:15.004 --> 18:15.805
Jakie!

18:15.805 --> 18:17.139
Jake?

18:17.139 --> 18:19.147
Jakie! Where are you?

18:36.560 --> 18:39.129
I'll take the one.
That's the one.

18:39.129 --> 18:41.631
Jakie! Come to Mommy, okay?

19:01.922 --> 19:03.191
Hello. We're here.

19:06.124 --> 19:08.328
Ooh! Look at this!

19:09.325 --> 19:10.396
Jakie! Come out!

19:14.063 --> 19:15.401
Jakie!

19:15.999 --> 19:18.803
Jakie!

19:20.707 --> 19:21.671
Jakie?

19:22.238 --> 19:24.006
Jakie? Jakie!

19:24.006 --> 19:25.873
Jakie! Jakie!

19:26.207 --> 19:27.240
Jake.

19:27.240 --> 19:28.810
Oh, my God.

19:28.810 --> 19:31.477
Don't you ever run away
from me like that again, okay?

19:31.477 --> 19:32.948
Let's go home. Okay, baby?

19:32.948 --> 19:34.215
Okay?

19:43.965 --> 19:44.760
Let's go home, baby, okay?

19:45.569 --> 19:46.597
We go home.

20:16.425 --> 20:17.628
Hey, buddy.

20:21.831 --> 20:23.897
How's your day been?

20:23.897 --> 20:26.274
Good, good.
"Good, good," good?

20:31.245 --> 20:32.677
Okay. All right.

20:32.677 --> 20:34.744
- That's enough Fute now, okay?
-Slow down, buddy.

20:36.482 --> 20:37.780
Jakie!

20:40.283 --> 20:41.751
Oh, poor Daddy.

20:46.663 --> 20:48.123
Oh, my God.

20:48.123 --> 20:49.495
Put him down.

20:53.527 --> 20:57.998

21:11.482 --> 21:12.713

21:12.713 --> 21:14.347

21:14.347 --> 21:15.653
It's too heavy.

21:16.353 --> 21:17.787
Anything on the queue?

21:18.286 --> 21:19.555
Mm-hmm.

21:19.555 --> 21:22.462
250 movies
we'll never actually watch.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.684
I almost lost him today.

21:50.221 --> 21:51.991
Lost him how?

and he was just playing
the stupid recorder

21:56.260 --> 21:58.762
and I just lost it. I snapped.

22:00.335 --> 22:02.465
I took my eye off him
for one second,

22:02.465 --> 22:03.965
and he wandered
into the woods...

22:03.965 --> 22:06.836
and I... I panicked, and all
I could think about was...

22:16.886 --> 22:17.847
Are we gonna be okay?

24:20.173 --> 24:21.303
Again.

24:27.345 --> 24:28.142
Again, again.

24:31.013 --> 24:33.348
Hey, who you
talking to, buddy?

24:33.348 --> 24:34.654
Dolly.

24:35.484 --> 24:36.689
To Dolly?

24:37.223 --> 24:38.152
Dolly.

24:40.323 --> 24:42.057
Dolly.

24:51.568 --> 24:53.270
Is there a moth in here?

24:53.270 --> 24:55.537
Mmm-mmm. Just Dolly.

24:55.537 --> 24:58.007
Come on. Lie down, kiddo.

24:59.213 --> 25:00.141
Let's get you tucked in.

25:03.349 --> 25:05.014
Where did you go?
Where'd you go?

25:07.751 --> 25:11.722
Okay, buddy, go into the light.

25:11.722 --> 25:13.792
There's peace and tranquility
in the light.

25:15.463 --> 25:17.191
All are welcome.

25:18.297 --> 25:20.562
All are welcome.

25:25.903 --> 25:27.608
All are not welcome.

26:46.748 --> 26:47.952
Pat?

26:51.487 --> 26:52.319
Pat?

26:54.257 --> 26:55.157
I'm here.

26:58.761 --> 26:59.964
What are you doing?

27:01.833 --> 27:03.066
I think there's somebody
out there.

27:04.204 --> 27:06.135
Oh. What?

27:09.104 --> 27:11.112
Don't bother.

27:11.112 --> 27:12.141
The power's out again.

27:13.645 --> 27:14.847
Just come here and listen.

27:15.878 --> 27:17.080
You're freaking me out, Pat.

27:17.612 --> 27:18.818
Just...

27:21.387 --> 27:22.684
Just listen.

27:22.684 --> 27:23.784
What am I listening for?

27:23.784 --> 27:27.090
This weird zipping sound.

27:27.090 --> 27:29.664
I couldn't, for the life of me,
place it until just now.

27:30.663 --> 27:32.828
Like a rucksack or duffel bag.

27:32.828 --> 27:34.531
Somebody's opening
and closing it

27:34.531 --> 27:35.901
just to mess with my head.

27:36.667 --> 27:37.936
Come on, Pat. Seriously?

27:40.370 --> 27:42.807
As soon as I figure out
where this asshole is hiding,

27:42.807 --> 27:44.374
I'm gonna kick his goddamn...

27:44.374 --> 27:45.507
Oh, shit, Jake.

27:46.609 --> 27:48.042
Hello. Hi. Yeah.

27:48.042 --> 27:49.148
Yeah, someone's breaking
into our house.

27:49.148 --> 27:50.110
Jake?

27:50.110 --> 27:51.618
Yeah,
it's 109 Walter Ave.

27:51.618 --> 27:52.948
Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy.
Daddy's here, all right?

27:52.948 --> 27:54.381
- Yes. Yeah, please hurry.
- I got you.

27:55.587 --> 27:56.916
Thank you. Please.

28:00.923 --> 28:02.125
Go ahead, take him.

28:04.058 --> 28:05.091
Where're you going?

28:05.091 --> 28:06.728
- I'm going downstairs.
- Pat, no.

28:06.728 --> 28:09.300
Just stay inside, okay?

28:09.300 --> 28:10.199
Close the door.

29:16.196 --> 29:17.772
You wanna
mess with me, man?

29:18.703 --> 29:19.939
Yeah, I'm right here.

29:21.606 --> 29:22.403
I'm right here!

29:49.832 --> 29:50.964
Pat.

29:50.964 --> 29:52.601
I said stay upstairs!

29:54.673 --> 29:55.909
What the hell is going on?

29:58.577 --> 29:59.440
Are you okay?

30:00.811 --> 30:02.014
Are you okay, babe?

30:03.177 --> 30:04.346
Come on. Go for it.

30:18.531 --> 30:19.560
Hey.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.126
Hey.

30:21.126 --> 30:22.934
I'd say welcome home, Pat,

30:22.934 --> 30:25.466
but somebody obviously
beat me to the punch.

30:26.906 --> 30:29.038
- You must be Karina. Hey.
- Hi.

30:29.038 --> 30:31.874
As far as the perp
gettin' inside...

30:31.874 --> 30:34.341
there's not a lot to go on.

30:34.341 --> 30:37.011
Well, I know for a fact
the doors were locked.

30:37.011 --> 30:38.479
You guys have a hide-a-key?

30:39.386 --> 30:40.485
Oh, yeah.

30:40.485 --> 30:41.581
Yes. Yeah, we do.

30:49.760 --> 30:50.858
Right here.

30:50.858 --> 30:52.498
Ah. Okay.

30:52.498 --> 30:54.560
Most likely scenario is,

30:54.560 --> 30:57.967
somebody saw the length
of the grass in your yard,

30:57.967 --> 30:59.299
thought you might be
outta town

30:59.299 --> 31:01.367
and decided to make
an impulse buy.

31:01.367 --> 31:04.811
So, why didn't
they steal anything?

31:04.811 --> 31:06.375
You're positive
nothing's missing?

31:07.715 --> 31:09.917
Yeah, not as far
as we can tell.

31:09.917 --> 31:12.348
Do me a favor.
Go through the house again.

31:12.348 --> 31:14.886
Make a list of anything
that's not where it should be.

31:14.886 --> 31:16.919
No matter
how small or insignificant.

31:16.919 --> 31:19.354
Yeah. I'll start
in the kitchen.

31:19.354 --> 31:21.594
Yeah, it felt more like
he was trying to scare us.

31:21.594 --> 31:23.392
Yeah, he did a good job too.

31:25.525 --> 31:27.528
Hey, Chief, you're gonna
wanna take a look at this.

31:28.797 --> 31:29.997
Pat...

31:29.997 --> 31:31.334
Can you come upstairs?

31:33.670 --> 31:34.469
Sure.

31:36.472 --> 31:38.339
A lot of these break-ins
where it looks like

31:38.339 --> 31:40.781
there was an ulterior motive
to robbery,

31:40.781 --> 31:43.181
turns out somebody
is sendin' a message.

31:46.315 --> 31:48.954
You sure
you didn't know this guy?

31:48.954 --> 31:50.419
Well, I mean,
I never got a look at him.

31:53.654 --> 31:56.326
You let me know
if you remember anything else.

31:57.364 --> 31:58.361
Okay?

31:58.761 --> 32:00.099
Okay.

32:02.471 --> 32:03.771
What do we got, Rawls?

32:03.771 --> 32:05.431
Well,
I'm not entirely sure, sir.

32:05.431 --> 32:07.370
Don't suppose
you made these?

32:09.642 --> 32:10.976
Yeah.

32:10.976 --> 32:13.673
Uh, yeah,
all the time when I was a kid.

32:14.982 --> 32:16.945
There're boxes of 'em
in the garage.

32:16.945 --> 32:19.479
You know, it seems to me like
someone was squatting here
like this, and, you know,

32:19.479 --> 32:21.920
tossing them. Like so.

32:21.920 --> 32:23.320
Maybe drawin'
your son's attention?

32:24.019 --> 32:25.058
Look...

32:25.824 --> 32:27.124
Tell 'em I sent you.

32:27.124 --> 32:29.091
They'll rig your whole house
for a song.

32:29.091 --> 32:32.131
And mow your lawn,
for chrissake.

32:56.689 --> 32:57.486
Jakie.

33:26.388 --> 33:27.450
Holy shit.

33:32.187 --> 33:35.022
Daddy, look at this.

33:35.022 --> 33:36.525
Very cool, buddy.

33:36.525 --> 33:39.528
Hey, so, pile on the right
goes back on the shelves.

33:39.528 --> 33:42.362
Everything on the left,
we can bag and toss outside.

33:42.362 --> 33:44.231
This asshole
really did rob us,

33:44.231 --> 33:45.303
he needs a new line of work.

33:46.270 --> 33:47.437
Where the hell
did you find this?

33:49.670 --> 33:52.673
Uh, I've never seen that
before in my life.

33:52.673 --> 33:54.711
So, what's it doing in
the bottom of the wastebasket

33:54.711 --> 33:55.676
in my office?

33:56.483 --> 33:57.480
No idea.

33:58.553 --> 34:00.052
It's, uh...

34:00.052 --> 34:01.550
It's one of the first things
I ever carved.

34:04.824 --> 34:05.719
Lost it years ago.

34:07.622 --> 34:10.625
Speaking of things
carved out of wood...

34:12.929 --> 34:14.734
Can you...

34:14.734 --> 34:16.136
ditch this for me somewhere?

34:16.636 --> 34:18.202
What for?

34:18.202 --> 34:19.965
It's literally
his favorite thing in the world.

34:19.965 --> 34:21.936
Yeah, and you need to find him
a new favorite thing, my love.

34:21.936 --> 34:23.539
A quieter thing,

34:23.539 --> 34:25.373
'cause if he blows this shit
in my ear one more time,

34:25.373 --> 34:27.413
you are never
getting laid again.

34:27.413 --> 34:28.549
Okay.

34:28.549 --> 34:29.509
I'll hide it out here

34:29.509 --> 34:31.448
until he drives you nuts
asking for it.

34:31.915 --> 34:33.512
Thank you.

34:33.512 --> 34:35.485
Uh, garbage goes
out front tonight.

34:44.828 --> 34:46.861
<i>The score is now
two-zero in favor of Texas.</i>

34:46.861 --> 34:48.033
Fute.

34:48.033 --> 34:49.935
<i>- Anderson is trying...</i>
- Later, Jakie.

34:49.935 --> 34:51.899
- You can play Fute later.
- Fute.

34:51.899 --> 34:53.470
Fute.

34:54.475 --> 34:55.907
Fute!

34:55.907 --> 34:58.738
Okay. Okay, fine, I'll get it.

34:58.738 --> 35:00.840
But you better play quietly,
or Mommy'll kill me.

35:02.577 --> 35:03.783
Hey, what do you say
when I say,

35:03.783 --> 35:04.679
"if you're okay in the tub?"

35:05.816 --> 35:06.853
Fute.

35:06.853 --> 35:08.850
No, no. What do you say?

35:08.850 --> 35:10.050
"Okay."

35:10.050 --> 35:11.886
Okay. All right.

35:11.886 --> 35:14.388
Mommy and Auntie Anna
are across the hall
if you need 'em.

35:14.388 --> 35:16.122
I'm going downstairs
for a sec.

35:16.122 --> 35:17.858
Okay.

35:17.858 --> 35:21.229
Sis, I'm, like, juggling
four different campaigns.

35:21.229 --> 35:23.233
You know, you promised me rose

35:23.233 --> 35:24.998
- and <i>Real Housewives.</i>
- Are you okay?

35:24.998 --> 35:26.140
Okay!

35:35.551 --> 35:36.810
Is that Dolly?

35:37.818 --> 35:39.112
You okay up there?

35:39.112 --> 35:40.418
Okay!

35:48.025 --> 35:49.022
Huh.

35:49.022 --> 35:50.659
Dolly!

35:57.837 --> 35:59.565
You okay, Jake?

36:04.743 --> 36:05.674
Jake?

36:08.681 --> 36:09.678
Jake?

36:14.121 --> 36:16.151
What are you
supposed to say, Jake?

36:18.718 --> 36:20.359
Daddy asked you
a question, Jakie.

36:23.060 --> 36:24.360
Okay.

36:24.360 --> 36:25.994
Did you
turn the lights off?

36:25.994 --> 36:27.098
Nope.

36:27.098 --> 36:27.927
Who are you playing with?

36:30.299 --> 36:32.000
Oh. There he is.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.402
Dolly.

36:33.402 --> 36:35.041
Where'd I put it?

36:35.041 --> 36:36.202
Who are you
playing with?

36:36.202 --> 36:37.541
Dolly.

37:01.770 --> 37:02.797
The hell are you?

37:09.744 --> 37:11.905
Have you been
able to stop thinking
about what happened?

37:14.010 --> 37:14.809
No.

37:17.685 --> 37:18.747
Have you?

37:20.082 --> 37:20.881
No.

38:00.389 --> 38:01.394
<i>Patrick.</i>

38:03.896 --> 38:04.793
<i>Patrick.</i>

38:05.967 --> 38:06.795
Need to ask you a question.

38:08.068 --> 38:09.266
Harvey says he spotted you

38:09.266 --> 38:10.769
playing by the old
service steps.

38:10.769 --> 38:12.298
Yeah, because...

38:12.298 --> 38:14.803
I was just looking
for softer wood to carve
than all this stupid oak.

38:20.314 --> 38:22.712
All right.
Let's you and me take a walk.

38:23.816 --> 38:24.813
Come on.

38:40.564 --> 38:41.599
You gotta be shitting me.

38:56.181 --> 38:57.381
<i>Your Promethian</i>

38:57.381 --> 38:59.078
<i>Home Security System
is activated.</i>

39:14.366 --> 39:17.063
<i>The alarm system
will reset in 30 seconds.</i>

40:57.499 --> 40:58.703
Jesus.

41:28.398 --> 41:29.228
Oh, my God.

41:32.335 --> 41:33.705
Screw you.

41:54.461 --> 41:55.727
Come on,
you gotta be shitting me.

43:09.367 --> 43:10.164
Karina!

43:20.510 --> 43:22.110
Karina, wake up!

43:23.480 --> 43:24.744
Pat!

43:24.744 --> 43:26.779
Pat! What's going on?

43:26.779 --> 43:27.948
Did you see him?

43:27.948 --> 43:29.117
- Did you see him?
-See who?

43:29.517 --> 43:31.117
What?

43:31.117 --> 43:32.920
- Just go back inside, okay?
- No, but what...

43:32.920 --> 43:34.427
Just go back inside.
Lock the door.

43:34.427 --> 43:35.893
- Pat, what... No! Pat!
- Just stay here.

43:39.529 --> 43:40.997
Where are you?

43:42.136 --> 43:43.164
Are you in here?

43:44.633 --> 43:45.870
Where are you?

43:50.373 --> 43:51.205
Come on.

43:53.006 --> 43:54.648
Come on.

43:55.183 --> 43:56.210
It's me.

44:00.849 --> 44:01.780
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

44:01.780 --> 44:03.952
And nobody's here.

44:03.952 --> 44:05.285
I swear I saw something...

44:06.259 --> 44:07.555
Alarm.

44:07.555 --> 44:08.827
One sec.

44:11.892 --> 44:12.992
No fingerprints

44:12.992 --> 44:14.797
or any of the doors
or windows,

44:14.797 --> 44:16.596
and none of the molds
in the backyard

44:16.596 --> 44:18.870
came up a match.

44:18.870 --> 44:23.070
Power company did confirm
13 separate interruptions,

44:23.070 --> 44:25.673
but insist the problem
is not on their end.

44:25.673 --> 44:26.746
Meaning what?

44:29.112 --> 44:32.485
You haven't had a new face
show up, have you?

44:32.485 --> 44:34.386
Different guy
checkin' the gas meter,

44:34.386 --> 44:37.083
- or fixin' a cable?
- No.

44:37.083 --> 44:38.692
And nothing missing
from the house?

44:45.266 --> 44:46.931
Uh, Jake has this...

44:47.863 --> 44:50.832
musical instrument, um...

44:50.832 --> 44:53.135
a recorder
that he loves to play,

44:55.038 --> 44:58.074
which I might have
thrown out by mistake.

45:00.208 --> 45:01.680
But even if I did,
it would still be

45:01.680 --> 45:03.442
in one of the garbage cans,
which it's not.

45:08.286 --> 45:09.283
And I...

45:12.352 --> 45:15.058
I could have sworn
I heard it being played.

45:16.561 --> 45:17.929
You know, last night.

45:43.453 --> 45:45.019
Hey.

45:45.019 --> 45:46.826
Thought I said,
"Take some time off."

45:49.662 --> 45:51.094
I need to show you something.

45:58.601 --> 46:00.938
So, what?

46:00.938 --> 46:03.971
There's a thousand more
like it back at the house.

46:03.971 --> 46:05.273
That's the only owl
I ever made.

46:08.142 --> 46:10.278
Do you remember
where I lost it?

46:16.349 --> 46:17.824
Don't tell me
you went back there?

46:20.622 --> 46:22.288
No.

46:22.288 --> 46:25.293
I found it in a trash bin
at home yesterday.

46:26.565 --> 46:28.133
How is that possible?

46:28.133 --> 46:29.231
It's not.

46:31.035 --> 46:33.004
Look what else
I found in Mom's garage.

46:47.048 --> 46:48.250
What are you saying, Patty?

46:50.391 --> 46:51.825
You explain it. I...

46:53.553 --> 46:55.994
Mom always had a knack
for finding lost stuff.

46:56.661 --> 46:57.831
You know she did.

46:59.095 --> 47:00.460
Keep digging
through that house

47:00.460 --> 47:02.902
and I guarantee you'll find
all kinds'a crazy shit.

47:08.035 --> 47:09.403
Maybe, in the meantime,

47:12.010 --> 47:13.972
I think you should
give that shrink a call.

47:13.972 --> 47:15.343
What was her name?

47:17.349 --> 47:18.346
Mary?

47:18.845 --> 47:21.120
Barbara.

47:21.120 --> 47:24.317
Yeah, something's
been bubbling up in you
for a long time now,

47:24.317 --> 47:26.354
and she always seemed to help
back in the day.

47:49.149 --> 47:51.379
Yeah, let your
brother have a go, all right?

47:52.914 --> 47:53.953
Not too high.

47:55.555 --> 47:56.417
Are you serious?

48:00.659 --> 48:01.760
Gotta go.

48:01.760 --> 48:03.127
Push it back.
Push it back.

48:04.563 --> 48:05.393
Push it back.

48:10.131 --> 48:11.604
-Present.
- Jeez.

48:11.604 --> 48:13.401
- Jakie, you scared me.
- Present.

48:13.902 --> 48:15.538
It's from Dolly.

48:15.538 --> 48:16.437
What is this?

48:17.510 --> 48:18.406
It's a present.

48:19.642 --> 48:20.540
Okay?

48:21.314 --> 48:22.344
Okay.

48:38.861 --> 48:39.658
What the hell?

48:54.448 --> 48:55.943
Shit. Jakie.

48:55.943 --> 48:57.016
Jakie, come out of there!

48:57.680 --> 48:58.611
Jakie!

49:03.153 --> 49:03.950
Jakie.

49:06.956 --> 49:08.390
Get away from him!

49:09.224 --> 49:10.427
Get the hell away from my son!

49:10.427 --> 49:11.459
Jakie!

49:11.859 --> 49:13.230
Jakie!

49:15.665 --> 49:16.930
Jakie. Come here.

49:16.930 --> 49:18.631
Come here. Jakie.

49:19.669 --> 49:20.738
Jakie!

49:51.337 --> 49:55.668
What's happening
to you both is very normal.

49:55.668 --> 50:00.307
To have your home invaded
is a traumatic experience,

50:00.307 --> 50:03.646
one that brings up
all kinds of issues.

50:03.646 --> 50:04.578
Such as?

50:05.245 --> 50:06.646
Such as,

50:06.646 --> 50:10.221
"How will I ever let my son
out of my sight again?"

50:10.885 --> 50:12.485
Or...

50:12.485 --> 50:15.688
"Did I fulfill my obligation
as a husband

50:16.631 --> 50:20.062
"and a father, and a man,

50:20.062 --> 50:21.694
"to protect
my wife and child?"

50:23.198 --> 50:25.971
Karina, Pat's description.

50:25.971 --> 50:29.006
It's quite evocative
of a persistent phobia

50:29.006 --> 50:31.044
your husband
struggled with as a child.

50:33.042 --> 50:34.176
Which, of course,

50:34.176 --> 50:37.479
is how Pat and I
came to know each other.

50:41.723 --> 50:43.555
What phobia was that?

50:43.555 --> 50:44.552
<i>Patrick.</i>

50:45.789 --> 50:46.587
<i>Patrick.</i>

50:48.389 --> 50:49.557
<i>Let's you and me take a walk.</i>

50:50.661 --> 50:51.592
Come on.

50:55.069 --> 50:56.564
You know, long before
we built this yard,

50:57.737 --> 50:59.432
this whole forest

50:59.432 --> 51:01.404
was basically
one big copper mine.

51:03.771 --> 51:05.606
Kicked out half the product
for the entire state,

51:06.981 --> 51:08.741
before they finally
dug the sucker dry.

51:11.780 --> 51:13.718
This was how you got down
to the main entry shaft...

51:15.285 --> 51:17.321
...back when it was owned
by the mining company.

51:18.452 --> 51:19.587
Who owns it now?

51:20.823 --> 51:21.622
Us?

51:29.432 --> 51:31.368
Now it belongs to Bagman.

51:34.943 --> 51:36.736
-Who's Bagman?
- Shh!

51:40.608 --> 51:42.608
You never know
who might be listenin'.

51:42.608 --> 51:44.612
I told your brother this story
last summer,

51:44.612 --> 51:47.052
just like your granddad did me
when I was your age

51:47.052 --> 51:49.151
and his granddad's
granddad before that.

51:49.151 --> 51:51.454
And all of them
swore it was true.

51:53.290 --> 51:54.622
Just like
I'm swearing to you now.

51:56.564 --> 51:57.625
They say...

51:58.658 --> 52:00.562
he wanders
the world each night,

52:01.328 --> 52:02.428
searching for children

52:02.428 --> 52:04.632
to stuff in that
awful bag a' his.

52:05.799 --> 52:07.737
- Not just any children...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:07.737 --> 52:09.575
Let me guess.

52:09.575 --> 52:11.677
He wants the naughty children
that don't listen
to their parents or...

52:11.677 --> 52:13.575
Wrong, Patty.

52:14.848 --> 52:16.314
It's the good kids he wants.

52:17.347 --> 52:19.647
The shiny ones
and the dreamers.

52:21.154 --> 52:23.585
Once they catch his eye,
or grab his fancy,

52:24.519 --> 52:26.352
he won't rest
until he has them

52:26.352 --> 52:29.094
slung over his bony shoulder.

52:29.094 --> 52:31.494
Screamin' for help
that's never gonna come.

52:36.367 --> 52:37.564
No, you're just trying
to scare me...

52:37.564 --> 52:39.002
Damn right,
I'm trying to scare you, boy.

52:39.002 --> 52:40.237
<i>And scared you better be!</i>

52:40.237 --> 52:41.502
<i>Wander too close,
he'll drag you in</i>

52:41.502 --> 52:43.271
<i>and make pencils
out of your fingers,</i>

52:43.271 --> 52:44.705
and gobble
the rest of you down!

52:47.407 --> 52:48.676
Are you with me, boy?

52:52.520 --> 52:53.516
<i>Good.</i>

52:54.116 --> 52:55.188
Bagman?

53:21.374 --> 53:22.710
You drew these?

53:25.783 --> 53:26.714
Yep.

53:38.728 --> 53:40.728
That's what I meant
by a persistent phobia.

53:41.901 --> 53:43.632
Pat's was so intense,

53:44.665 --> 53:46.201
I felt it was crucial
to give him

53:46.201 --> 53:48.602
as much context as possible

53:48.602 --> 53:50.969
for the familial lore
that provoked it.

53:57.251 --> 54:02.286
As you can see,
the so-called Bag or Sackman,

54:02.286 --> 54:05.324
is a figure common
to almost every culture.

54:06.487 --> 54:09.228
Curiously, his methodology,

54:09.228 --> 54:11.759
even the phenomena
that accompany his presence,

54:12.493 --> 54:15.428
are remarkably consistent.

54:15.428 --> 54:17.695
He has the power to paralyze

54:17.695 --> 54:20.534
and incapacitate
parents and adults

54:20.534 --> 54:23.241
leaving their young ones
vulnerable.

54:23.241 --> 54:26.439
And he feeds off
the child's fear and anxiety.

54:26.439 --> 54:30.745
It sustains him, nourishes him.

54:30.745 --> 54:34.946
He can lure children to his lair
with toys or candy...

54:34.946 --> 54:38.421
And when the child
is at their most terrified,

54:38.421 --> 54:41.789
he steals them away
in his sack or bag.

54:42.856 --> 54:44.256
Are you trying
to make us feel stupid?

54:44.256 --> 54:45.759
On the contrary.

54:45.759 --> 54:49.928
I never told Karina
about the Bagman, Barbara,

54:49.928 --> 54:52.600
and it wasn't a dream
that broke into our house.

54:52.600 --> 54:56.173
No, but I'd suggest,
as a coping mechanism,

54:56.173 --> 54:58.744
you're projecting
the supernatural

54:58.744 --> 55:00.440
onto something...

55:00.440 --> 55:03.610
all too painfully real.

55:03.610 --> 55:07.016
And until you deal
with the real stuff

55:07.016 --> 55:08.387
bubbling up for you,

55:09.250 --> 55:10.684
the anger,

55:10.684 --> 55:14.587
the feelings of vulnerability,
and violation,

55:14.587 --> 55:17.026
your panic attacks
and nightmares

55:17.026 --> 55:18.661
will only get worse.

55:19.328 --> 55:20.531
Okay, so,

55:21.463 --> 55:22.830
what do you suggest we do?

55:27.367 --> 55:28.500
I see her.

55:28.500 --> 55:31.443
I'm the zombie.

55:32.707 --> 55:33.805
- Whoa! Hey, guys.
-Okay.

55:33.805 --> 55:35.643
So, he goes down 7:30
at the latest.

55:35.643 --> 55:37.442
- We read two stories...
- Two stories, yeah.

55:37.442 --> 55:38.983
...and then we sing
<i>Frere Jacques</i> when
he goes in the Pack 'n Play.

55:38.983 --> 55:40.685
Guys, check your phone.

55:40.685 --> 55:42.981
I just texted you
the confirmation number
for a room at the Hyatt.

55:42.981 --> 55:44.350
Two blocks from here,
three from the restaurant.

55:44.350 --> 55:45.952
Already paid for.

55:45.952 --> 55:47.724
Dinner's one thing,
but there's no chance in hell

55:47.724 --> 55:49.622
we're sleeping
in a different place
than Jakie right now.

55:49.622 --> 55:51.357
Who said anything
about sleeping?

55:51.357 --> 55:53.630
Who said sleeping?

55:54.895 --> 55:56.131
Will you just get her
out of here, Pat?

55:56.131 --> 55:57.731
Who said...

55:57.731 --> 56:00.037
Jakie,
listen to Auntie Anna, okay?

56:00.037 --> 56:01.206
Call any time!

56:01.206 --> 56:03.638
We can be back,
five minutes tops, okay?

56:03.638 --> 56:05.070
Gonna play zombie.

56:11.284 --> 56:12.880
I'm not sure
I'm up for this.

56:15.285 --> 56:16.455
Yeah, me neither.

56:19.120 --> 56:23.627
Worst case, we get dinner to go
and eat on Anna's couch.

56:25.162 --> 56:26.728
Yep.

56:26.728 --> 56:28.934
Let's at least try to make it
as far as dessert,

56:28.934 --> 56:29.963
so she can put Jakie down.

56:37.076 --> 56:37.905
So, what's the verdict?

56:41.982 --> 56:42.910
Is your husband nuts?

56:46.678 --> 56:47.915
Completely fricking crackers.

56:54.155 --> 56:57.430
So, what actually happened
with you and Liam at the mine?

56:59.633 --> 57:03.095
Well, I thought I felt someone
cut off a lock of my hair.

57:05.101 --> 57:05.933
I, uh...

57:07.501 --> 57:08.700
I lost my shit

57:08.700 --> 57:11.404
and then
we ran home screaming.

57:11.404 --> 57:13.575
A lock of your hair?

57:13.575 --> 57:16.380
Yeah. Bagman supposedly
always snips

57:16.380 --> 57:18.110
one off the kids
that catch his fancy.

57:19.019 --> 57:20.178
That's how it starts.

57:21.318 --> 57:22.147
What the hell for?

57:23.720 --> 57:25.917
So he always knows
where to find you.

57:25.917 --> 57:28.120
No matter where
you try to run or hide.

57:32.364 --> 57:35.128
Your father was something else.

57:35.128 --> 57:38.302
I think in his own way
he was just trying
to protect me.

57:38.302 --> 57:39.967
A cautionary tale
to keep me safe.

57:44.872 --> 57:46.475
All I remember
was Mom was furious

57:46.475 --> 57:48.311
'cause every night
I was convinced

57:48.311 --> 57:49.581
he was tapping on my window.

57:50.545 --> 57:52.613
And then one night,

57:52.613 --> 57:54.982
the old man came in
and he said,

57:57.386 --> 58:00.823
"Your mum wants me to tell you
there's no such thing
as Bagman."

58:03.428 --> 58:04.992
But I'm afraid
I can't do that.

58:09.200 --> 58:10.228
What I can do...

58:11.869 --> 58:14.771
is tell you a secret
he don't want you to know.

58:17.009 --> 58:18.905
Truth is,

58:18.905 --> 58:22.542
no matter how big, or fast,
or sneaky he is,

58:22.542 --> 58:24.011
he has weaknesses as well.

58:25.618 --> 58:28.521
Escape his grasp long enough,
he'll rot away.

58:30.085 --> 58:33.251
And he cannot lay a single,
skinny finger on you.

58:34.456 --> 58:35.561
Not as long...

58:37.427 --> 58:38.223
as you have this.

58:43.733 --> 58:45.297
You see,
every kid's got something

58:45.297 --> 58:48.035
that means more to them
than anything else
in the world.

58:49.869 --> 58:51.104
Something they love so much,

58:53.107 --> 58:55.614
it literally becomes
a piece of who they are.

58:56.578 --> 58:57.913
And believe you me,

58:58.712 --> 59:00.047
a child's love...

59:01.616 --> 59:03.586
can be a magical thing.

59:03.586 --> 59:05.822
It can turn even
the humblest object...

59:07.588 --> 59:08.759
into a totem...

59:09.524 --> 59:10.959
of great power.

59:15.062 --> 59:17.366
Now you keep this
close to your heart,

59:17.366 --> 59:19.297
and he cannot touch you.

59:24.275 --> 59:25.705
But lose it,

59:25.705 --> 59:28.075
or even worse,
throw it away...

59:38.852 --> 59:39.856
So, you keep ahold of it.

59:41.292 --> 59:42.089
No matter what.

59:47.960 --> 59:50.229
And now you're concerned...

59:51.304 --> 59:52.264
that Fute has gone missing.

59:54.269 --> 59:56.642
If the one thing that can
supposedly protect Jake...

59:58.145 --> 59:59.139
from you-know-who...

01:00:00.678 --> 01:00:01.845
is the thing
that he loves the most?

01:00:03.607 --> 01:00:04.947
Honestly?

01:00:09.184 --> 01:00:11.718
Well, what I wanna
do right now is go back home

01:00:11.718 --> 01:00:13.120
and dig through the trash again.

01:00:15.155 --> 01:00:16.925
But if we go down
that thought track,

01:00:16.925 --> 01:00:18.895
I'm not sure we'll make it
to the other side, so...

01:00:25.065 --> 01:00:26.870
Did Barbara help
when you were eight?

01:00:28.202 --> 01:00:29.972
Wouldn't have made it
to nine without her.

01:00:31.576 --> 01:00:32.909
So, we have to trust her now.

01:00:51.895 --> 01:00:54.499
No,
I do not miss you at all.

01:00:54.499 --> 01:00:56.367
<i>What?</i>
Mmm-mmm.

01:00:56.367 --> 01:00:58.798
I have a real hot date tonight.

01:00:58.798 --> 01:01:00.934
<i>- Oh, yeah?</i>
- Three feet tall,

01:01:00.934 --> 01:01:03.603
talks gibberish
and craps his own pants.

01:01:03.603 --> 01:01:05.838
It is so, so sexy.

01:01:05.838 --> 01:01:07.207
<i>Stop it.</i>

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:10.182
Okay, babe, um...

01:01:10.182 --> 01:01:11.444
We'll see you tomorrow.

01:01:11.444 --> 01:01:12.511
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:01:12.511 --> 01:01:14.553
Yeah.

01:01:14.553 --> 01:01:19.018
And why don't you
make me something sweet?

01:01:19.018 --> 01:01:21.553
<i>Something sweet?
What do you mean?</i>

01:01:22.855 --> 01:01:24.023
<i>I don't know what you mean.</i>

01:01:24.023 --> 01:01:26.358
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

01:01:28.598 --> 01:01:31.002
Okay. Okay, babe.

01:01:31.002 --> 01:01:32.100
Yeah. Bye.

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:53.845
<i>Hey.</i>

01:02:53.845 --> 01:02:55.379
- Angelo.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

01:02:55.379 --> 01:02:58.588
Is there something weird
happening on this floor?

01:02:58.588 --> 01:03:00.719
<i>Uh, what do you mean, "weird"?</i>

01:03:00.719 --> 01:03:02.055
I don't know.

01:03:02.055 --> 01:03:04.289
I'm hearing a voice
on a baby monitor.

01:03:04.289 --> 01:03:06.727
<i>Everything's clear
on my security cams.</i>

01:03:06.727 --> 01:03:07.792
<i>You want me to come up?</i>

01:03:07.792 --> 01:03:09.164
No, no. Um...

01:03:09.897 --> 01:03:11.402
I'm sure it's nothing.

01:03:11.402 --> 01:03:13.434
<i>Okay. Take it easy.</i>

01:03:13.434 --> 01:03:14.466
Yeah.

01:03:25.686 --> 01:03:27.886
Angelo, has there been
a power surge?

01:03:29.884 --> 01:03:31.516
Angelo, are you there?

01:03:36.561 --> 01:03:37.357
Come on.

01:03:39.726 --> 01:03:40.833
Shit.

01:04:20.938 --> 01:04:23.068
I don't know
what you want from me.

01:04:23.068 --> 01:04:25.306
But the cops are on their way!

01:04:30.550 --> 01:04:32.049
Did I mention I have a gun?

01:04:37.251 --> 01:04:39.419
Don't play with me,
motherfucker!

01:04:57.177 --> 01:04:58.174
Sarah!

01:04:59.039 --> 01:05:01.012
Sarah, call the police!

01:06:28.733 --> 01:06:29.628
Stay back.

01:06:30.866 --> 01:06:31.663
Karina.

01:06:33.068 --> 01:06:35.098
Anna? Anna, are you okay?

01:06:35.098 --> 01:06:36.503
Are you okay?

01:06:38.005 --> 01:06:38.838
What happened?

01:06:38.838 --> 01:06:40.441
Where's Jakie?

01:06:42.111 --> 01:06:43.878
We got him. He's okay.

01:06:43.878 --> 01:06:45.710
Hey, buddy. Hey. Hey.

01:06:46.717 --> 01:06:47.646
There you go.

01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:50.582
It's okay. Thank you.

01:06:50.582 --> 01:06:53.551
We've got nothing
on the CCTV camera.

01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:56.094
It was knocked out
when the power went down.

01:06:57.125 --> 01:06:58.690
Thank God for the doorman.

01:07:00.428 --> 01:07:03.029
Once the camera
on Anna's floor went dark,

01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:04.531
he headed straight up.

01:07:05.905 --> 01:07:08.037
He must have
scared the guy off.

01:07:08.037 --> 01:07:09.602
- Did Angelo get a look at him?
- No.

01:07:10.938 --> 01:07:12.403
But, Pat,

01:07:12.403 --> 01:07:14.206
apparently
there are similarities

01:07:14.206 --> 01:07:16.312
to a case from four years ago.

01:07:18.414 --> 01:07:21.084
A girl named
Emily Greenberg went missing.

01:07:21.084 --> 01:07:24.186
Her dad suffered
similar symptoms to Anna's,

01:07:24.186 --> 01:07:28.619
temporary paralysis
and loss of speech.

01:07:28.619 --> 01:07:32.762
And these strange abrasions
on his face.

01:07:32.762 --> 01:07:34.099
He said he couldn't move.

01:07:34.931 --> 01:07:36.099
He had to lie there

01:07:36.099 --> 01:07:37.463
and watch this lunatic
stuff his daughter

01:07:37.463 --> 01:07:40.336
into a duffel bag
and run off with her.

01:07:47.475 --> 01:07:49.411
Look, we're gonna
get you somewhere safe.

01:07:50.244 --> 01:07:51.377
I'll post officers outside

01:07:51.377 --> 01:07:53.085
who'll keep watch
around the clock.

01:07:55.149 --> 01:07:56.514
Don't worry, Pat.

01:07:56.514 --> 01:07:58.321
We're gonna catch
this sick bastard.

01:08:06.027 --> 01:08:07.059
Thanks.

01:08:07.059 --> 01:08:08.331
No problem.

01:08:09.363 --> 01:08:10.863
This way. Right here.

01:08:10.863 --> 01:08:12.637
Come on.

01:08:12.637 --> 01:08:13.600
Watch your step, okay?

01:08:28.718 --> 01:08:31.319
They're trying to figure out
what paralyzed Anna,

01:08:31.319 --> 01:08:32.751
and the doctors
don't have a frickin' clue.

01:08:34.224 --> 01:08:35.787
Who cares,
as long as Anna's okay.

01:08:36.795 --> 01:08:38.656
She's far from okay.

01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:40.594
All right, she refused to stay
in the hospital.

01:08:40.594 --> 01:08:43.428
She wouldn't even let us
turn the lights off upstairs.

01:08:43.428 --> 01:08:44.836
Karina had to give her
a sedative

01:08:44.836 --> 01:08:46.499
and get in bed with her,
you know?

01:08:46.499 --> 01:08:48.800
Well, she can stay here
as long as she needs to.

01:08:52.072 --> 01:08:52.905
Thank you.

01:08:52.905 --> 01:08:54.342
Please.

01:08:54.342 --> 01:08:56.643
We'd be insulted
if you went anywhere else.

01:08:59.046 --> 01:09:00.416
Come here.

01:09:10.357 --> 01:09:11.493
I'm sorry.

01:09:13.159 --> 01:09:14.397
For what?

01:09:16.230 --> 01:09:17.268
Protecting my son?

01:09:23.610 --> 01:09:24.940
Get some sleep.

01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:26.343
I'm not going anywhere.

01:09:49.098 --> 01:09:50.235
'Bout time.

01:09:54.403 --> 01:09:55.603
What are you doing awake?

01:10:29.435 --> 01:10:30.440
We'll get through this.

01:10:32.007 --> 01:10:32.904
I promise.

01:10:50.592 --> 01:10:52.528
I can't believe
this is happening.

01:10:53.661 --> 01:10:55.828
What do we do
if he really does exist...

01:10:58.064 --> 01:11:00.767
and we have lost the one thing
in the whole world...

01:11:02.371 --> 01:11:04.309
that could keep our son safe?

01:11:08.474 --> 01:11:09.776
I'll make him a new one.

01:11:12.347 --> 01:11:13.780
No, that won't be the same.

01:11:16.516 --> 01:11:19.016
Hey, get some sleep, honey.

01:11:20.022 --> 01:11:20.820
All right?

01:12:00.732 --> 01:12:01.964
Jake!

01:12:01.964 --> 01:12:03.296
- Pat?
- Jake!

01:12:11.705 --> 01:12:14.711
Daddy. Daddy, help me.
Help me.

01:12:14.711 --> 01:12:15.776
Jake.

01:12:16.176 --> 01:12:16.975
Jake!

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.177
He's got the boy!

01:12:25.087 --> 01:12:26.721
Pat? Pat?

01:12:33.063 --> 01:12:33.992
Help!

01:12:36.097 --> 01:12:36.896
Help!

01:12:38.036 --> 01:12:39.404
Somebody stop him!

01:13:10.563 --> 01:13:11.628
Stop right there!

01:13:11.628 --> 01:13:14.098
Daddy, help me.

01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:45.967
Daddy! Help me!

01:13:45.967 --> 01:13:46.999
Jake!

01:14:10.290 --> 01:14:11.496
Jake!

01:14:14.428 --> 01:14:15.632
Daddy!

01:14:17.803 --> 01:14:18.965
Help.

01:14:20.533 --> 01:14:22.738
Daddy! Help me!

01:14:24.603 --> 01:14:27.479
Daddy, help me.

01:14:38.650 --> 01:14:39.986
Jake?

01:14:41.222 --> 01:14:42.021
Jake?

01:15:24.301 --> 01:15:26.703
Jake? Are you in here?

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:28.540
Jake?

01:15:32.977 --> 01:15:33.974
Jake?

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:40.945
God, please. God.

01:16:40.945 --> 01:16:42.108
No, no, no.

01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:13.139
What the heck?

01:17:34.532 --> 01:17:36.195
<i>Daddy.</i>

01:17:37.497 --> 01:17:42.674
<i>Daddy.</i>

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:49.043
<i>Daddy, help me!</i>

01:18:01.389 --> 01:18:02.854
Mommy!

01:18:02.854 --> 01:18:04.124
Jakie?

01:18:05.891 --> 01:18:07.296
Oh, my God, Jake.

01:18:07.296 --> 01:18:09.660
Oh, my gosh. Jake!

01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:10.529
Karina!

01:18:15.737 --> 01:18:17.803
Karina, what's happening?

01:18:17.803 --> 01:18:19.337
It's not Jake that he came for.

01:18:22.207 --> 01:18:24.881
Show yourself,
you sick bastard!

01:18:27.648 --> 01:18:29.149
Show yourself!

01:19:35.183 --> 01:19:38.117
<i>First,
he steals a lock of your hair,</i>

01:19:38.117 --> 01:19:40.286
<i>so he always knows
where to find you.</i>

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:45.126
<i>And then he taunts you
and feeds off your fear.</i>

01:19:46.961 --> 01:19:48.599
<i>It's the good kids he wants.</i>

01:19:48.599 --> 01:19:51.429
<i>The shiny ones
and the dreamers.</i>

01:19:51.429 --> 01:19:54.099
<i>And once they catch his eye,
or grab his fancy,</i>

01:19:54.099 --> 01:19:56.033
<i>he won't rest
until he has them</i>

01:19:56.033 --> 01:19:58.137
<i>slung over his bony shoulder,</i>

01:19:58.137 --> 01:20:01.142
screamin' for help
that's never gonna come.

01:20:03.748 --> 01:20:06.147
Why come
for me now, huh?

01:20:07.012 --> 01:20:08.545
After all this time?

01:20:17.092 --> 01:20:19.094
Now you keep this
close to your heart,

01:20:19.893 --> 01:20:21.492
and he cannot touch you.

01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:25.062
<i>But lose it,</i>

01:20:25.062 --> 01:20:27.905
or even worse,
throw it away...

01:20:51.257 --> 01:20:54.457
The cold hard truth of it,
Patty,

01:20:54.457 --> 01:20:56.395
is that there are monsters
in this world.

01:20:57.897 --> 01:20:59.101
There is evil.

01:21:00.333 --> 01:21:02.368
And bad things
do happen to good people.

01:21:05.169 --> 01:21:06.372
Even little children.

01:21:41.873 --> 01:21:44.179
<i>The only thing that
gives me comfort at night...</i>

01:21:46.612 --> 01:21:49.446
is a belief that there's
something good out there,

01:21:49.446 --> 01:21:51.582
much more powerful
than all the bad stuff.

01:21:53.486 --> 01:21:55.421
<i>Something that loves
and watches over us.</i>

01:21:56.692 --> 01:21:57.555
<i>No matter what.</i>

01:22:18.177 --> 01:22:19.643
And you really believe that?

01:22:23.487 --> 01:22:24.615
I'm lookin' at the proof.

01:23:44.293 --> 01:23:47.434
Come on! It's me you want!

01:23:48.373 --> 01:23:49.370
Come on.

01:24:23.775 --> 01:24:25.203
Yeah, this way.

01:24:25.203 --> 01:24:26.572
Down here! On me! Keep going.

01:24:27.939 --> 01:24:29.541
<i>I don't know who's on foot.</i>

01:24:29.541 --> 01:24:31.374
Down by the yard,
keep a guard here.

01:24:31.374 --> 01:24:33.211
What is it? What is it?

01:24:33.211 --> 01:24:34.778
This is as far as she goes.

01:24:36.516 --> 01:24:38.419
Pat must have
taken a different route.

01:24:42.354 --> 01:24:43.589
Yo, boss, we got something.

01:24:45.191 --> 01:24:46.795
It's got blood on it.

01:24:46.795 --> 01:24:47.824
Let's fan out!

01:24:48.633 --> 01:24:49.700
What is that?

01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:50.794
That's Jake's flute.

01:24:58.037 --> 01:24:59.276
Pat. Pat!

01:24:59.276 --> 01:25:00.441
Pat!

01:25:02.348 --> 01:25:03.345
Pat!

01:25:04.009 --> 01:25:05.314
Pat!

01:25:05.978 --> 01:25:07.918
Pat!

01:25:07.918 --> 01:25:09.049
You need
to step away from...

01:25:09.049 --> 01:25:10.451
Pat! Can you hear me?

01:25:11.557 --> 01:25:12.684
Pat!

01:25:14.954 --> 01:25:15.852
Pat!

01:25:16.989 --> 01:25:18.327
Pat!

01:25:19.090 --> 01:25:20.296
Pat!

01:25:41.615 --> 01:25:43.954
Mom said we could stay
as long as we need to.

01:25:43.954 --> 01:25:45.621
I just can't be
in this house anymore.

01:25:45.621 --> 01:25:46.652
Not without Pat.

01:25:47.353 --> 01:25:49.686
There's still hope, 'Rina.

01:25:49.686 --> 01:25:51.657
I mean, they haven't
even found anything yet.

01:25:52.731 --> 01:25:53.659
They're not going to.

01:25:56.198 --> 01:25:57.564
And it's not over yet, either.

01:25:59.705 --> 01:26:00.666
What do you mean?

01:26:02.835 --> 01:26:04.868
He's gonna come back for Jake.
I can just feel it.

01:26:08.373 --> 01:26:09.675
What are you gonna do?

01:26:13.917 --> 01:26:14.845
Whatever it takes.

01:26:19.119 --> 01:26:20.290
Okay. Come here.

01:26:29.563 --> 01:26:33.129
Just call me
when you get there. Okay?

01:26:33.129 --> 01:26:34.700
Yep. Yep.

01:26:35.606 --> 01:26:36.636
Yep.

01:26:39.610 --> 01:26:40.706
Yeah.

01:27:12.771 --> 01:27:14.740
Hey, so I got some
good news for you, pal.

01:27:16.309 --> 01:27:17.347
Look what Daddy found.

01:27:18.011 --> 01:27:18.909
Fute.

01:27:23.914 --> 01:27:26.785
You know, he gave everything
to get that back for you.

01:27:31.863 --> 01:27:33.759
And, um... And Daddy...

01:27:34.294 --> 01:27:35.594
He also told me a secret

01:27:35.594 --> 01:27:36.894
that he really,
really wants you to know.

01:27:40.469 --> 01:27:42.306
Okay, so how much
do you love Fute, Jakie?

01:27:43.704 --> 01:27:46.277
Yeah. So a child's love
is a magical thing.

01:27:49.376 --> 01:27:50.380
Keep it close to your heart.

01:27:53.217 --> 01:27:54.318
And it will always
protect you.

01:27:56.150 --> 01:27:57.618
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:27:58.183 --> 01:27:58.982
Okay.

01:28:00.251 --> 01:28:01.556
Always.

01:28:02.088 --> 01:28:03.294
Always.
