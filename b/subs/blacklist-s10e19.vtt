WEBVTT

00:28.154 --> 00:29.405
4:00 a.m, really?

00:47.047 --> 00:48.132
Hey.

00:48.132 --> 00:50.050
<i>Hope I haven't woken you.</i>

00:50.050 --> 00:51.635
No, I wish you'd woken me.

00:51.635 --> 00:53.846
That would mean I would have
been sleeping,

00:53.846 --> 00:56.640
but I don't remember sleep anymore.

01:06.650 --> 01:08.110
Early even for you, Raymond.

01:08.110 --> 01:10.279
Sorry to disturb you, Harold.

01:10.488 --> 01:13.449
<i>I'm afraid I have something
that just can't wait.</i>

01:13.449 --> 01:15.034
I'll be there as soon as I can.

01:15.034 --> 01:16.368
This better be important.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.620
It's very important.

01:17.620 --> 01:19.121
<i>How fast can you get here?</i>

01:19.121 --> 01:22.166
F-Fast.
I'm kind of already dressed.

01:22.374 --> 01:25.461
Although I think I should probably change.

01:25.461 --> 01:26.837
It's okay, I'm awake.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.881
I'm studying algebra
so I can help Agnes with her homework.

01:29.215 --> 01:30.549
Well, you'll have to put off

01:30.549 --> 01:33.385
your middle-school studies
for now, Harold.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.930
I need you
to be here for this.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.223
All of you.

01:37.223 --> 01:38.933
What do you mean by "here"?

01:59.411 --> 02:01.038
This better be good.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.958
I assure you, I wouldn't have
disturbed you all

02:03.958 --> 02:08.254
at this ungodly hour
if the circumstances weren't dire.

02:08.254 --> 02:09.588
What's going on, Raymond?

02:09.588 --> 02:12.049
I just left
a meeting with a friend

02:12.049 --> 02:15.302
who prefers his cocktails before dawn.

02:15.302 --> 02:19.223
Something about keeping
the ghosts of his ex-wives at bay.

02:19.223 --> 02:23.269
But his twilight tipples also
have the added advantage

02:23.269 --> 02:26.272
of loosening the tongues
of his drinking companions

02:26.272 --> 02:29.692
as alcohol's effects
on the human brain

02:29.692 --> 02:34.530
are two to three times
greater after midnight.

02:35.072 --> 02:40.494
So my friend hears many things,
some rumor, some not,

02:40.494 --> 02:46.083
but this morning he put me
onto something truly sensational.

02:46.584 --> 02:49.962
Anyone here heard
of the Friedman Report?

02:52.089 --> 02:54.091
No, should we have?

02:54.216 --> 02:55.885
I wouldn't think so.

02:55.885 --> 02:59.221
It's a top-secret Air Force
intelligence report

02:59.430 --> 03:01.056
of great sensitivity.

03:01.056 --> 03:05.311
My friend was told
the Friedman Report is going to be stolen.

03:05.561 --> 03:08.772
He didn't know where,
only that it will happen today.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.774
What is the Friedman Report?

03:10.774 --> 03:14.528
Its subject is this country's
nuclear arsenal,

03:14.528 --> 03:16.447
which has seen better days.

03:16.447 --> 03:19.867
There are hundreds of
underground missile silos

03:19.867 --> 03:24.204
scattered across
the Midwest and west.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.833
A lot of them neglected
and unloved.

03:27.833 --> 03:30.502
Some in such urgent need of repair

03:30.502 --> 03:32.922
that they're susceptible to sabotage.

03:32.922 --> 03:37.676
The Friedman Report outlines
the security faults

03:37.676 --> 03:42.014
and weaknesses
of each decrepit silo in detail.

03:42.014 --> 03:43.974
If it falls into the wrong hands...

03:43.974 --> 03:46.226
America's nukes could be
turned against us.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.519
Theoretically speaking.

03:47.519 --> 03:48.979
Who's trying to steal it?

03:51.899 --> 03:54.526
I'm hoping you all can figure that out.

03:55.069 --> 03:57.237
All good, Joker?
Same deal as in Santa Anita.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.530
Sounds good.

03:58.530 --> 03:59.907
- Do we have...
- Right here.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.241
What's our timing on this?

04:01.241 --> 04:03.994
- In and out in 10 minutes.
- Let's go.

04:03.994 --> 04:06.497
Where'd you get this tip?
From whom exactly?

04:06.956 --> 04:08.999
I'm really not at liberty to say.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.252
For once, why don't you just tell us

04:12.252 --> 04:13.921
what's in it for you?

04:13.921 --> 04:16.256
This is a win for the task force.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.800
Nothing more.

04:22.054 --> 04:24.765
So, the clock is already ticking.

04:24.765 --> 04:29.603
I'll leave the situation
in your capable hands.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.813
I wish you luck.

04:30.813 --> 04:34.066
And, please,
do keep me updated.

04:35.234 --> 04:36.485
Ah!

04:43.200 --> 04:44.868
May I?

04:44.868 --> 04:46.537
Take as many as you'd like.

04:46.537 --> 04:48.747
Eh, just the one will do, thank you.

04:53.877 --> 04:56.630
The shade of gray on these walls...

04:58.632 --> 05:01.635
I don't think I've ever seen
that precise shade

05:01.635 --> 05:03.137
anywhere else.

05:03.137 --> 05:05.055
It's called Anvil Gray.

05:05.055 --> 05:07.558
I checked a color wheel. I get bored.

05:09.935 --> 05:10.978
Ah!

05:31.832 --> 05:33.625
I feel like we don't say this enough,

05:33.625 --> 05:36.378
but that man is just so strange.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.967
That he is, but if his intel's for real,
we need to act fast.

05:41.967 --> 05:45.345
Dembe, Ressler, get to the Office
of the Director of National Intelligence.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.556
Let them know the report is under threat.

05:47.556 --> 05:49.600
- Find and secure it.
- On our way.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.101
But stay sharp.

05:51.727 --> 05:55.689
Siya's right. Reddington seems off.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.316
Well, he's always off.

05:57.316 --> 06:00.736
Still, for safety's sake,
just expect the unexpected.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.828
Jonathan, come on in.
I bought you a coffee.

06:09.828 --> 06:12.915
New place on 13th, it'll change your life.
Have a seat. Come on.

06:20.964 --> 06:23.008
I'm... I'm... I'm not your pal.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.261
I'm not asking you to be.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.721
But I do need your help.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.307
Yet, by helping you,
I am betraying my friend.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.767
I'd probably be dead by now

06:31.767 --> 06:34.061
if it wasn't for Donald Ressler.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.396
I'm sure he's an excellent sponsor.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.273
He's working with Raymond Reddington

06:38.273 --> 06:40.109
or else Reddington's working him.

06:40.109 --> 06:43.112
I haven't quite figured it all out.

06:43.112 --> 06:44.530
Which is why I need you.

06:44.530 --> 06:46.657
I was right, wasn't I?

06:46.657 --> 06:47.991
You found out Ressler

06:47.991 --> 06:50.077
was connected to Elizabeth Keen,

06:50.077 --> 06:52.621
- who went on the run with Reddington?
- It doesn't prove anything.

06:52.871 --> 06:58.043
No, but it raises doubts and suspicions.

06:58.293 --> 07:00.629
A federal judge has seen enough
to agree with me.

07:00.629 --> 07:03.882
She granted a warrant
for a wiretap on Ressler's phone.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.676
Well, if you do have a warrant,

07:05.801 --> 07:07.010
then why do you need me?

07:07.010 --> 07:08.428
Can't... Can't the FBI

07:08.428 --> 07:10.472
or some other law enforcement agency

07:10.472 --> 07:12.933
tap Don's phone themselves?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.476
It's not that simple.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.979
Ressler's task force
operates under deep cover.

07:16.979 --> 07:18.772
Nobody at the DOJ knows it exists,

07:18.772 --> 07:21.733
except maybe the FBI Director
and the AG.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.153
If we alert him to what's going on,

07:24.153 --> 07:26.280
they may protect their people.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.490
This has to be done surgically.

07:28.740 --> 07:31.160
You mean by preying on the bond

07:31.160 --> 07:32.828
between two recovering addicts.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.581
There are two possibilities.

07:35.706 --> 07:37.624
One, this is a terrible misunderstanding

07:37.624 --> 07:39.126
and I'm chasing a decent guy.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.837
I really hope that's true
because the other possibility

07:41.837 --> 07:45.757
is that a decorated FBI agent
is secretly working

07:45.757 --> 07:48.218
for the world's most wanted man.

07:48.552 --> 07:51.722
We won't know either way
until you get me proof.

07:54.641 --> 07:57.686
- What's this?
- That is millions in DARPA research funds

07:57.686 --> 07:59.646
direct from the NSA.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.316
Ressler will have an FBI-issued cellphone,

08:02.524 --> 08:04.151
un-tappable by conventional means.

08:04.151 --> 08:07.571
But if you unlock Ressler's phone
and plug that in,

08:07.571 --> 08:09.990
in seconds, it'll upload a software

08:10.115 --> 08:11.241
that'll activate a tap.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.035
You expect me to get my hands

08:13.035 --> 08:15.037
on Don's cellphone and unlock it?

08:15.579 --> 08:17.789
You'll find a way.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.710
If Ressler is in over his head

08:21.710 --> 08:23.086
the way I think he is,

08:24.338 --> 08:26.089
you'll be doing him a favor.

08:46.985 --> 08:48.362
Jammer's up.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.530
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to discuss the Friedman Report.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.698
You don't have the clearance.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.533
I'm sorry, there's no time to waste.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.702
We know the report is about
vulnerable missile silos.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.829
It could be used to facilitate an attack

08:57.829 --> 08:59.498
against our nuclear arsenal.

08:59.498 --> 09:01.083
How... How did you...

09:01.083 --> 09:03.043
Tell us everything about this report.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.712
We have information
that it's about to be stolen.

09:05.712 --> 09:08.131
- Impossible.
- An asset informed us

09:08.131 --> 09:10.842
that the report is currently
exposed and under threat.

09:12.678 --> 09:13.887
Would you please see

09:13.887 --> 09:15.639
who last accessed the report?

09:15.639 --> 09:17.808
<i>Yes, Madam Deputy Director.</i>

09:17.808 --> 09:19.017
You understand
that this report

09:19.017 --> 09:20.394
is a state secret.

09:20.394 --> 09:21.853
That you've heard of it...

09:21.853 --> 09:23.522
<i>General Friedman</i>

09:23.522 --> 09:25.983
<i>checked out an encrypted
laptop last night.</i>

09:25.983 --> 09:27.776
<i>The report's due to
the Joint Chiefs tomorrow,</i>

09:27.776 --> 09:30.237
<i>and he wanted to do some
last-minute line editing.</i>

09:30.237 --> 09:32.406
He took a top-secret
report home with him?

09:32.406 --> 09:34.992
<i>I guess that's becoming
quite the thing these days.</i>

09:34.992 --> 09:36.535
<i>He's a four-star general in the Air Force.</i>

09:36.535 --> 09:39.329
<i>We couldn't just chain him to his desk.</i>

09:39.621 --> 09:40.956
<i>He likes to work at home,</i>

09:41.081 --> 09:42.791
<i>and he's practically turned
his house into a fortress.</i>

09:42.791 --> 09:44.084
<i>That may not be enough
to protect him.</i>

09:44.084 --> 09:46.837
I suggest you call the general quickly.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.311
His line is dead.

10:02.311 --> 10:04.021
We need to secure the general.

10:04.021 --> 10:05.355
My agents can handle that. Annie...

10:05.355 --> 10:07.024
Your agents can follow us to his house.

10:07.024 --> 10:08.775
This is above your pay grade.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.152
ODNI is more than capable.

10:10.152 --> 10:12.321
No, I'm sorry. The general's address, now.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.249
Target's internal security feeds
will now loop

10:24.374 --> 10:26.418
the previous 10 seconds of footage.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.506
We're ready to breach.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.054
I can't believe General Friedman

10:37.054 --> 10:39.056
would take a top-secret
nuclear dossier home with him.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.892
Reddington's intel was spot on.

10:42.893 --> 10:45.395
It's still going straight
to Friedman's voicemail?

10:45.395 --> 10:47.981
Yes. We have to assume the worst.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.733
<i>Perhaps a signal jammer?</i>

10:49.733 --> 10:52.778
<i>Which means
that the thieves are already in his house</i>

10:52.778 --> 10:54.404
<i>or on their way in.</i>

10:55.322 --> 10:57.491
How else can we get an alert
to the general?

10:57.491 --> 11:01.286
<i>Not all signal jammers
block Wi-Fi.</i>

11:01.870 --> 11:03.163
We could try a video chat.

11:03.413 --> 11:04.539
Do it.

11:13.924 --> 11:15.926
<i>- General Friedman.</i>
- Who are you?

11:15.926 --> 11:17.511
<i>Agent Dembe Zuma, FBI.</i>

11:17.511 --> 11:19.179
We have intel that a team of assailants

11:19.179 --> 11:21.515
are trying to steal the Friedman Report.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.433
- How do you know about that?
<i>- There's no time.</i>

11:23.558 --> 11:25.560
<i>Do you have a secure place
in your house?</i>

11:25.560 --> 11:27.562
- Of course.
<i>- Take the laptop and get there now.</i>

11:27.562 --> 11:29.022
<i>We are on our way.</i>

11:46.415 --> 11:47.624
He's going upstairs.

12:00.095 --> 12:01.346
That'll be the panic room.

12:10.647 --> 12:13.275
Go on! Get out!
The FBI are on their way.

12:13.275 --> 12:15.110
You're gonna get yourself killed.

12:35.797 --> 12:38.258
Reddington, your friend
was right about that report.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.427
Wonderful, I'm just calling to check in.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.096
<i>A four-star general
took it home on a laptop.</i>

12:43.096 --> 12:44.264
<i>We just made contact.</i>

12:44.264 --> 12:45.474
The thieves are inside,

12:45.474 --> 12:46.808
but he has a panic room.

12:46.808 --> 12:47.934
Ressler and Dembe are five minutes out.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.269
<i>Excellent work, Harold.</i>

12:49.269 --> 12:51.396
Since it's under control, I'll be off.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.449
It's an abort.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.367
- We're almost through.
<i>- Doesn't matter.</i>

13:04.367 --> 13:06.203
Bogeys on route. Need to move now.

13:06.203 --> 13:07.621
Heard.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.206
You good on foot?

13:09.206 --> 13:10.749
Don't worry about us. Gun it.

13:10.749 --> 13:12.292
See you at the rendezvous point.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.173
I'm alright.

13:18.173 --> 13:20.300
I've been through worse, much worse.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.260
But we should be worried
about the report.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.845
Well, the laptop is secure.

13:23.845 --> 13:25.597
But the assailants got away.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.892
- Who were they?
- We don't know that yet, sir.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.560
How did you know they were
going to try to steal it

13:30.560 --> 13:32.229
if you don't know who they are?

13:32.229 --> 13:34.940
- Our task force was tipped off.
- By whom?

13:36.107 --> 13:37.567
By an asset I can't identify.

13:39.528 --> 13:41.404
Are you really gonna
make me remind you

13:41.404 --> 13:42.822
of my clearance level

13:42.822 --> 13:44.824
as a full general in the US Air Force?

13:44.824 --> 13:47.536
I'm sorry, General Friedman,
but I work for a task force

13:47.661 --> 13:49.538
that operates under special authority.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.957
Now, what I want to know is

13:51.957 --> 13:53.875
why these thieves made a break for it

13:53.875 --> 13:55.418
halfway through the robbery.

13:55.544 --> 13:57.295
Any luck with the security cameras?

13:57.295 --> 13:58.713
They compromised the system.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.423
No footage for the past half-hour.

14:00.423 --> 14:01.591
There is good news.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.176
We canvassed the neighborhood,
turns out the general's

14:03.176 --> 14:05.512
next-door neighbors
have security cameras, too.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.306
Believe it or not, they just
installed them two days ago.

14:08.306 --> 14:10.976
They won some sweepstakes
from a home-security company.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.187
- Really?
- Once in a while, things go our way.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.022
My guys will send you the footage,

14:16.022 --> 14:18.817
but I snapped a photo
of the feed, if it helps.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.110
What do we got?

14:21.945 --> 14:23.530
One of the perpetrators.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.906
That's a pretty clean shot.

14:24.906 --> 14:26.950
We might be able to pull an ID from that.

14:27.659 --> 14:30.745
The general said
our other suspect is a female,

14:30.745 --> 14:34.791
African-American, 20s, bleached-blonde.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.001
Take that.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.460
I'll coordinate with the search team.

14:38.461 --> 14:39.546
Jonathan, what's up?

14:39.546 --> 14:41.923
Uh, I... I messed up, Don.

14:42.090 --> 14:43.883
- Where are you?
<i>- It... It's not that.</i>

14:43.883 --> 14:45.885
I... I haven't used. I...

14:45.885 --> 14:48.013
I just... I don't know what I'm gonna do.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.556
Just relax.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.016
I'm winding down at work,

14:51.016 --> 14:53.893
but I can meet you
around noon for coffee.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.061
Steinway Diner?

14:55.061 --> 14:56.896
Yeah, I'll... I'll be there.

15:08.199 --> 15:10.327
When Jill said
I could move back,

15:10.327 --> 15:11.828
I was over the moon.

15:11.828 --> 15:14.289
But then, once I did,
I started to notice

15:14.289 --> 15:15.915
that things were different.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.543
She was acting differently around me,

15:18.543 --> 15:20.128
you know, jumpier.

15:20.128 --> 15:23.965
Yesterday, I caught her
hiding money from me.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.717
And I... I blew up.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.302
I could... I couldn't help it.

15:27.302 --> 15:29.179
Clearly, she doesn't trust me,

15:29.179 --> 15:30.722
and that triggered me.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.891
I yelled. She cried.

15:33.933 --> 15:37.020
Two days ago we were
golden and today...

15:38.104 --> 15:39.898
Do you want to use?

15:39.898 --> 15:42.275
I, uh, well,
it's the same old story, right?

15:42.275 --> 15:45.487
Like, rationally, no, but subconsciously,

15:45.487 --> 15:48.156
I feel like I am a hair away
from being out of control.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.700
This is a setback.
But these things happen.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.160
The most important thing is

15:52.160 --> 15:54.454
that you don't let this turn
into a backslide.

15:54.829 --> 15:57.123
Okay? Look, I've been there.

15:57.248 --> 16:00.794
I'm sorry.
Can I get the check, please?

16:00.794 --> 16:02.379
I've got to get back to work.

16:02.379 --> 16:03.672
Big case.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.590
Yeah, no, I... I... I know how it is.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.134
Um, b-b-before you go, uh, h-how do I

16:08.134 --> 16:09.302
deal with Jill?

16:10.303 --> 16:11.846
Let me give you some advice on women...

16:13.306 --> 16:14.683
Like I'm an expert.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.185
All the cliches are true.

16:17.185 --> 16:18.561
All you've got to do is talk to her.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.397
Tell her how you feel, communicate.

16:20.397 --> 16:22.148
The rest will take care of itself.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.192
I should call her right now.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.111
- That's the idea.
- She won't answer.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.487
Not if she sees my number.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.905
Well, use my phone.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.245
You're gonna regret it if you don't.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.205
Um, do you mind if I, uh, step outside

16:37.205 --> 16:38.748
for some, uh, privacy?

16:39.040 --> 16:41.459
I'll pay the check.
I'll be out in a few.

17:12.782 --> 17:14.492
Hey, did you get ahold of her?

17:14.492 --> 17:15.660
Uh, she didn't answer.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.203
I... I left a message.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.872
You did the right thing.

17:24.002 --> 17:26.045
- Sorry I'm late.
- Not a problem.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.505
Where are we?

17:27.505 --> 17:29.174
Forensics swept General Friedman's house,

17:29.174 --> 17:30.592
but it was clean.

17:30.592 --> 17:32.343
No DNA, no fingerprints.

17:32.343 --> 17:34.512
So Reddington doesn't have
any leads on who we're after?

17:34.512 --> 17:36.389
None. But we found one.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.891
I cross-referenced this image

17:37.891 --> 17:40.727
with all criminal databases, no luck.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.438
Then I thought,
let's try state and federal employees,

17:43.438 --> 17:45.774
because I don't know how
they treat any of you at the DMV,

17:45.774 --> 17:48.526
but that is a criminal enterprise
if there ever was one.

17:50.612 --> 17:53.031
In any case, I got a hit.

17:53.031 --> 17:54.199
Seymour Jacobson.

17:54.199 --> 17:55.784
Works at the Capitol Building.

17:55.784 --> 17:57.786
I was hoping that it was a congressman.

17:57.786 --> 18:00.747
That'd be a story,
but, no, he's a janitor.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.540
So the person
who broke into Friedman's house

18:02.540 --> 18:05.043
- works inside the US Capitol?
- That's right.

18:05.043 --> 18:06.628
I sent a team to his home,
but he's not there.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.422
The place has been
totally emptied, cleared out.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.257
When was the last time
anyone saw Jacobson?

18:11.257 --> 18:12.801
Yesterday at work.

18:12.801 --> 18:14.302
I contacted Capitol maintenance,

18:14.302 --> 18:16.262
and they gave me access
to their security feeds.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.681
We were just about
to review the footage.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.603
This is the Capitol?

18:23.603 --> 18:25.730
There are miles of hallways
under the building.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.607
It's a rabbit warren down there.

18:31.694 --> 18:34.113
There's a dead spot
in the camera footage.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.366
He hasn't come back. Where is he?

18:36.366 --> 18:37.867
Fast-forward the footage.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.455
Forty minutes.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.541
Where did he go in all that time?

18:45.750 --> 18:47.085
As Architect of the Capitol,

18:47.085 --> 18:49.170
it's my job to conduct
comprehensive background checks

18:49.170 --> 18:50.922
on everyone we hire to maintenance.

18:50.922 --> 18:53.466
I find it highly unlikely
that any of my employees

18:53.466 --> 18:54.634
could be a thief.

18:54.634 --> 18:55.969
Believe it or don't.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.221
Seymour Jacobson broke into the home

18:58.221 --> 19:00.223
of an Air Force general this morning.

19:00.223 --> 19:02.475
A video your security team
sent over suggests

19:02.475 --> 19:05.228
he's up to something curious
right here at the Capitol.

19:05.228 --> 19:06.729
With this kind of security,

19:06.729 --> 19:08.398
what surprises me is that he disappeared

19:08.398 --> 19:10.066
off-camera for 40 minutes.

19:10.233 --> 19:13.528
The Capitol Building has 500
rooms and miles of corridors,

19:13.528 --> 19:15.488
some dead spots are inevitable.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.866
Whatever he was doing,
we'll soon find out.

19:17.866 --> 19:20.410
- We're here now.
- Wait, that...

19:20.410 --> 19:21.744
That door isn't visible

19:21.744 --> 19:23.663
to any of the security-camera angles.

19:25.331 --> 19:28.167
- Huh.
- What do you mean, "Huh"?

19:28.710 --> 19:30.795
I had no idea there was
a circuit-breaker room here.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.505
I'm not down here much, nobody is.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.132
Are you sure that's what it is?

19:34.924 --> 19:36.759
- No.
- Do you have a key?

19:36.926 --> 19:39.262
I've never noticed this door,
let alone opened it.

19:39.262 --> 19:41.681
You better get somebody down here
who can open it.

19:42.473 --> 19:43.600
Now.

20:05.747 --> 20:08.458
<i>...will be very
important, Madame Speaker.</i>

20:08.458 --> 20:10.001
I know that woman.

20:10.001 --> 20:12.170
That's the US Ambassador to the UK.

20:12.170 --> 20:15.256
And she's talking to
the Speaker of the House.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.802
And that's the Senate Majority Leader.

20:19.802 --> 20:21.804
The Senate Majority Leader?

20:22.722 --> 20:24.307
Is this live?

20:24.307 --> 20:25.850
It sure looks that way.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.144
They have surveillance
on half the politicians

20:28.144 --> 20:29.604
in Washington here.

20:30.188 --> 20:33.566
Oh, my God, this is...
I have to alert someone.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.234
Everyone.

20:42.784 --> 20:44.494
You're telling me
these people bugged

20:44.494 --> 20:46.120
every room in the Capitol?

20:46.120 --> 20:48.247
Maybe not every room but enough.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.041
There are feeds coming out
of the offices

20:50.041 --> 20:52.293
of every congressman, senator,

20:52.293 --> 20:54.587
the Federal Judiciary Building.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.756
Don't forget what appears to be

20:56.756 --> 20:59.175
the deliberation room
for the Supreme Court.

20:59.175 --> 21:02.512
It's a violation of the very heart
of American political power.

21:02.512 --> 21:05.556
If this makes headlines,
it'll be the biggest thing since...

21:06.391 --> 21:07.725
It'll be the biggest thing.

21:07.725 --> 21:09.769
<i>Any idea who's behind this?</i>

21:11.020 --> 21:13.022
We may have a way to find out

21:13.022 --> 21:15.149
if we can trace the phone line

21:15.149 --> 21:17.485
to this fax machine.

21:17.485 --> 21:18.736
Would you look at that?

21:18.736 --> 21:20.279
Did you say "fax machine"?

21:20.279 --> 21:21.864
<i>I don't know
whether it's part of their operation</i>

21:21.864 --> 21:23.032
<i>or a museum exhibit,</i>

21:23.032 --> 21:25.201
but, yeah, they have a fax machine here.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.203
The people behind the biggest
intelligence breach

21:27.203 --> 21:30.081
in US history are communicating by fax?

21:30.081 --> 21:31.332
That's dope.

21:31.332 --> 21:33.668
The machine looks like
it's from the late '90s.

21:33.668 --> 21:36.212
I'm guessing. I've never used one.

21:36.212 --> 21:39.674
Does it have a button
labeled "last" or "memory"?

21:39.674 --> 21:40.925
Yes, memory.

21:50.393 --> 21:51.769
It worked.

21:51.769 --> 21:54.939
The last fax sent was,
"Friedman Report will be

21:54.939 --> 21:56.899
at Columbia Heights address tonight."

21:56.899 --> 21:59.027
If that fax came from here,
then the intel

21:59.027 --> 22:02.071
on the Friedman Report came
from one of these bugs within the Capitol.

22:02.572 --> 22:04.490
Maybe Red intercepted the fax.

22:05.033 --> 22:08.244
There were no twilight drinks
with a friend who fed him this case.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.497
Voicemail.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.041
Raymond's not picking up.

22:13.041 --> 22:14.333
The question is,

22:14.333 --> 22:15.918
where was this message sent?

22:16.335 --> 22:18.129
Whoever's on the other end

22:18.254 --> 22:20.798
is clearly who Jacobson
and his band of merry thieves

22:20.798 --> 22:21.883
are reporting to.

22:21.883 --> 22:23.217
We've got to track down that number.

22:24.093 --> 22:25.094
Thank you, Adam.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.097
Good Lord.

22:29.265 --> 22:30.349
Agent Ressler.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.685
Deputy Director Rutherford,
we were just about to call you.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.520
I'm sure you were.

22:34.520 --> 22:38.441
Thankfully, Mr. Rose was quicker on
the uptake and reported to us right away.

22:39.484 --> 22:41.402
The Office of the Director
of National Intelligence

22:41.527 --> 22:43.488
will be taking point on this. You can go.

22:43.488 --> 22:45.114
- We have to determine...
- Now.

22:50.453 --> 22:52.038
As you've read in your briefings,

22:52.038 --> 22:54.165
we're here today because of
an unprecedented act of treason

22:54.165 --> 22:56.042
against the United States.

22:56.626 --> 23:00.088
A spy ring operating
within our very halls of power

23:00.088 --> 23:02.882
has been watching and recording

23:02.882 --> 23:05.176
the every move of our leaders for...

23:05.176 --> 23:08.054
Well, we're not entirely sure how long.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.808
Though the base of the spy ring
within the Capitol has been shut down,

23:11.808 --> 23:13.559
the sole identified member of the ring,

23:13.559 --> 23:17.188
Seymour Jacobson, is currently
a fugitive from justice.

23:17.188 --> 23:20.066
We have no idea who instigated
this incursion,

23:20.066 --> 23:23.111
nor what they've done with
the vitally sensitive intelligence

23:23.111 --> 23:24.403
they've collected.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.073
The question facing us is
how do we react?

23:27.365 --> 23:30.743
One thing's for certain,
this cannot leave this room.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.912
Finding out who's behind this breach

23:32.912 --> 23:34.413
begins with establishing

23:34.413 --> 23:37.291
how the FBI learned it was happening.

23:37.291 --> 23:40.086
Assistant Director Cooper,
could you speak to that?

23:40.086 --> 23:43.840
The information that led us
to room 417 originated with an asset.

23:44.257 --> 23:45.925
And who exactly is this asset?

23:47.176 --> 23:48.886
I can't reveal that information.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.680
Harold, I respect your commitment

23:50.680 --> 23:52.431
to protocol here, but really.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.267
We're still working with our asset

23:54.267 --> 23:55.935
to get to the bottom of this.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.937
Revealing that asset's identity,

23:57.937 --> 23:59.856
including to the people in this room,

23:59.856 --> 24:01.941
would compromise
their ability to help us.

24:01.941 --> 24:05.236
You have Seymour Jacobson
as a suspect to pursue.

24:05.862 --> 24:08.072
My team is providing you with this intel,

24:08.072 --> 24:10.658
which you never would
have discovered on your own.

24:10.658 --> 24:13.119
As you said,
it's up to the people at this table

24:13.119 --> 24:15.496
to decide what to do with the intel.

24:15.496 --> 24:17.832
For now, my task force will do everything

24:17.832 --> 24:20.293
that we can to find out who's responsible.

24:22.044 --> 24:23.713
How long has Cooper been in
with the panel?

24:24.255 --> 24:25.506
Over an hour.

24:26.382 --> 24:27.800
Looking for answers he doesn't have.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.010
We need to help him find some.

24:29.010 --> 24:30.887
Raymond still isn't answering.

24:30.887 --> 24:32.680
Somebody's bugged the Capitol.

24:32.680 --> 24:35.850
Whoever it is is connected
to the number at the top of this fax.

24:35.850 --> 24:38.019
Now, if we find out where that number is,

24:38.144 --> 24:39.312
maybe we can find them.

24:39.312 --> 24:40.855
Oh, if they're still communicating by fax,

24:40.855 --> 24:42.732
we might try a Steely Dan concert.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.195
Maybe they think fax machines
are still hard to trace.

24:47.195 --> 24:49.488
It's certainly been tougher for us.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.867
Herbie, have you contacted
the phone company

24:52.992 --> 24:54.619
about the number on the last fax?

24:54.619 --> 24:56.954
That's the thing.
The number the fax was sent to

24:56.954 --> 24:58.247
isn't operated by the phone company.

24:58.789 --> 25:00.750
In 2003, the company sold the number

25:00.750 --> 25:02.668
to an electromechanical
switchboard exchange.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.337
I'm sorry, a what?

25:04.462 --> 25:05.713
They used to be a thing.

25:05.713 --> 25:07.048
Manual telephone exchanges

25:07.048 --> 25:09.008
operating on pre-digital technology.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.551
Common in rural areas.

25:10.718 --> 25:12.720
But when the Bell System
was broken up in the '80s,

25:12.720 --> 25:14.347
almost all were shut down.

25:14.347 --> 25:16.098
Phone company told me this exchange

25:16.098 --> 25:17.892
was one of the last left in America.

25:17.892 --> 25:21.687
The company that owns it
is called Evelyn Strategies Inc.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.022
Evelyn Strategies?

25:23.022 --> 25:24.774
That name sounds familiar.

25:24.774 --> 25:26.317
Did you get an address?

25:26.317 --> 25:28.486
I got one from when
they first incorporated,

25:28.486 --> 25:29.987
but that was two decades ago.

25:29.987 --> 25:31.656
It's in Rosslyn.

25:31.656 --> 25:34.742
139 North Ode Street, Suite 602.

25:35.451 --> 25:36.869
Looks like an office.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.038
The switchboard could be long gone by now.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.499
It's the only lead we have.
Let's roll out.

25:53.386 --> 25:55.763
Evelyn Strategies. 602.

25:55.763 --> 25:56.931
It's still here.

25:56.931 --> 26:00.768
Same building as a yoga studio.

26:00.768 --> 26:03.562
Why keep office space
for outdated technology?

26:03.562 --> 26:05.439
We'll soon find out.

26:15.449 --> 26:17.743
This must be the switchboard exchange.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.453
A little worse for the wear.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.040
This one is still powered up.

26:33.301 --> 26:35.011
This fax was sent from the Capitol.

26:36.804 --> 26:38.222
Right after the Friedman fax.

26:38.222 --> 26:39.598
The numbers are the same.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.976
So this is where the Capitol spies

26:41.976 --> 26:43.394
were sending their reports.

26:44.854 --> 26:46.897
But all the other machines...

26:50.359 --> 26:52.278
Look at the dial-up codes.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.989
Plus 44, this fax came from the UK.

26:54.989 --> 26:56.991
Plus 49, that's Germany.

26:57.199 --> 26:58.743
Plus 7, Russia.

26:58.743 --> 27:00.328
Here's Belgium.

27:03.581 --> 27:06.542
- And mainland China.
- But what does it mean?

27:06.542 --> 27:09.837
Room 417 wasn't the only place
sending intel here.

27:09.837 --> 27:12.131
There are dozens of other
intelligence networks

27:12.131 --> 27:14.258
embedded all around the world.

27:14.258 --> 27:16.010
How can you be sure?

27:18.179 --> 27:19.347
Fax machines.

27:19.347 --> 27:22.683
Analog, entirely below the radar.

27:23.434 --> 27:24.602
The scale of this thing.

27:24.602 --> 27:26.228
Wheels within wheels.

27:26.228 --> 27:27.563
Don't you see?

27:28.272 --> 27:30.483
Donald, what you are looking at

27:30.483 --> 27:33.778
is Raymond Reddington's
intelligence empire.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.448
Or it was.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.586
Jonathan. You're wrong about Don.

27:50.711 --> 27:51.837
He's salt of the earth.

27:51.837 --> 27:52.963
Did you do it?

27:53.672 --> 27:55.007
He's a good man.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.509
I hope you're right.

27:56.509 --> 27:58.928
You probably think
you're a pretty good man, too.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.855
This is Reddington's operation?
I don't believe it.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.399
<i>I didn't want
to believe it either,</i>

28:11.399 --> 28:14.527
but it's clear now Raymond
has been bugging the Capitol

28:14.527 --> 28:16.320
and multiple entities abroad.

28:16.445 --> 28:17.905
I think we should assume

28:17.905 --> 28:20.116
<i>those entities are on par
with the Capitol.</i>

28:20.116 --> 28:23.994
This was a hub
for intel feeds from across the globe.

28:24.537 --> 28:26.288
How could you not have known?

28:26.288 --> 28:29.166
<i>I only ever knew
what Raymond wanted me to know.</i>

28:29.583 --> 28:31.293
Some years ago, he gave me a peek

28:31.293 --> 28:33.671
into the workings
of his intelligence network.

28:37.341 --> 28:39.844
<i>It was shortly before Elizabeth died.</i>

28:39.844 --> 28:42.638
<i>Raymond flew us
to a command center in Latvia.</i>

28:42.638 --> 28:46.392
This is where intelligence
from 17 outposts

28:46.392 --> 28:50.229
around the world is gathered,
sorted, and analyzed.

28:50.229 --> 28:53.274
Leaked documents,
intercepted communiques,

28:53.274 --> 28:56.735
secrets from people
in positions of power.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.613
Seventeen outposts,
outposts which I had never seen before

28:59.613 --> 29:01.449
and knew nothing about.

29:01.449 --> 29:04.618
<i>But I heard Raymond talk about
his intelligence operation.</i>

29:04.618 --> 29:07.288
I knew this was a source

29:07.288 --> 29:09.248
of his endless supply of secrets

29:09.248 --> 29:11.876
<i>about world leaders, corporations,</i>

29:11.876 --> 29:15.045
<i>rogue states, and criminals.</i>

29:15.629 --> 29:19.967
The system is a living,
breathing apparatus

29:19.967 --> 29:22.970
that powers many
of the decisions I make.

29:22.970 --> 29:24.472
The source of The Blacklist.

29:24.472 --> 29:26.098
One of the sources.

29:26.098 --> 29:29.685
Raymond also relies heavily
on his personal contacts, as we know.

29:29.685 --> 29:32.021
<i>While most of his empire was digitized,</i>

29:32.021 --> 29:35.065
<i>Raymond was always jumpy
about the computerization</i>

29:35.274 --> 29:36.650
<i>of his intelligence network.</i>

29:36.650 --> 29:38.652
To avoid detection, he was emphatic

29:38.652 --> 29:41.447
that it should be kept analog.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.449
Analog, like a fax machine.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.284
Or an electromechanical switchboard.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.453
And you're suggesting
that exchange serviced

29:47.453 --> 29:49.705
intelligence outposts around the world.

29:49.705 --> 29:52.958
Each one embedded deep
inside highly secure targets.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.794
<i>I believe
it's safe to assume that no one outpost</i>

29:55.794 --> 29:57.171
<i>knew about the other one.</i>

29:57.171 --> 30:00.257
<i>Raymond was the one linking them all.</i>

30:00.257 --> 30:02.676
<i>There must have been many places
for him to access intel,</i>

30:02.676 --> 30:06.013
<i>but when he was in D.C.,
he'd use Evelyn.</i>

30:11.227 --> 30:13.395
<i>Looks like he shut it all down.</i>

30:13.395 --> 30:14.647
Thank you.

30:14.647 --> 30:15.814
<i>Reddington must have known</i>

30:15.814 --> 30:17.107
<i>we'd get to all this information.</i>

30:17.608 --> 30:18.943
That's why he handed us this case.

30:19.276 --> 30:21.237
A <i>case that's been suspect.</i>

30:21.237 --> 30:23.072
We got security footage of Jacobson

30:23.072 --> 30:24.782
leaving General Friedman's house

30:24.782 --> 30:26.450
from the next-door neighbors.

30:26.450 --> 30:28.244
These thieves who were good enough

30:28.244 --> 30:30.287
to work for Reddington
went through the trouble

30:30.287 --> 30:32.331
to shut down Friedman's security system

30:32.331 --> 30:34.333
but just missed the one next door?

30:34.333 --> 30:36.794
Hmm. The police told us
the next-door neighbors

30:36.794 --> 30:39.505
had just won a security system
in a sweepstakes.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.674
Who ever heard of a home-security company

30:41.674 --> 30:42.925
running a sweepstakes?

30:42.925 --> 30:45.594
Now, what do you want to bet
that this couple

30:45.594 --> 30:47.012
has an angel investor

30:47.137 --> 30:49.640
funding their new home-security cameras?

30:49.890 --> 30:54.228
Hi! It's your lucky day.

30:54.228 --> 30:56.105
<i>The only conclusion is
that Raymond wanted us</i>

30:56.105 --> 31:00.025
to expose his intelligence network
after he shut it down.

31:00.150 --> 31:01.819
<i>That's not all he shut down.</i>

31:02.111 --> 31:04.697
I knew Evelyn Strategies Inc.
sounded familiar,

31:04.697 --> 31:07.283
so I looked through
the files from our raid

31:07.283 --> 31:09.535
on the Morgana Logistics Corporation,

31:09.535 --> 31:11.370
the one that creates fake companies

31:11.370 --> 31:13.414
to cover up criminal activities.

31:13.581 --> 31:15.791
Evelyn was one of their creations.

31:15.791 --> 31:17.585
So Morgana is Raymond, too.

31:17.585 --> 31:18.794
Masterful.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.422
Dembe, you didn't know about Morgana?

31:21.880 --> 31:23.424
I only knew a lot about Raymond

31:23.424 --> 31:25.551
and very little about his empire.

31:26.594 --> 31:28.178
But it makes sense.

31:28.178 --> 31:29.847
No one was arrested
at the Morgana raid

31:29.847 --> 31:32.474
except for that one warehouse manager,

31:32.474 --> 31:33.934
Gerome Kavanaugh.

31:33.934 --> 31:36.145
And he skipped town on a $3 million bail.

31:36.145 --> 31:37.938
And who would we know
that has that kind of money?

31:37.938 --> 31:40.566
So Reddington created
both Morgana and Evelyn

31:40.566 --> 31:42.401
and then used us to shut them down.

31:42.401 --> 31:45.070
Shipping and intelligence,
two of his biggest assets.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.489
<i>We helped Reddington
maintain his empire.</i>

31:47.489 --> 31:51.410
<i>And now he's fooled us
into helping him tear it down, but why?</i>

31:52.578 --> 31:54.622
I want to thank you
for doing this, Agent Galanter.

31:54.622 --> 31:56.373
I'm glad NSA was able to spare you.

31:56.373 --> 31:59.501
Understand I'm acting
as an agent of the court.

32:00.127 --> 32:01.712
I'm only doing this in pursuance

32:01.837 --> 32:03.589
of fulfilling the judge's warrant

32:03.589 --> 32:05.507
to tap Donald Ressler's phone.

32:05.507 --> 32:07.259
I don't have skin in the game here.

32:07.259 --> 32:11.805
But if what I read in
the judge's ruling is true,

32:11.805 --> 32:14.350
this could be quite a doozy.

32:16.769 --> 32:19.021
Looks like Ressler's on a call now.

32:19.021 --> 32:20.397
Is this gonna work?

32:20.564 --> 32:21.857
I've gambled everything on this.

32:21.857 --> 32:23.692
Well, just... Just hang on.

32:26.070 --> 32:27.696
- <i>...does what he does.</i>
- Bingo.

32:27.696 --> 32:29.031
<i>I've wondered for a long time</i>

32:29.031 --> 32:30.199
<i>what would be my last straw.</i>

32:30.199 --> 32:32.534
<i>This might be it.</i>

32:32.534 --> 32:35.954
<i>Reddington's been our CI
for nearly 12 years.</i>

32:36.163 --> 32:38.707
<i>We offered him
protection while he built out</i>

32:38.707 --> 32:41.293
<i>and strengthened
a vast criminal network.</i>

32:41.293 --> 32:44.588
<i>We've protected him while
he hardwired the US Capitol</i>

32:44.588 --> 32:47.800
<i>and intercepted
a decade's worth of state secrets.</i>

32:49.218 --> 32:51.762
In a way, we've been
his partners in treason.

32:52.388 --> 32:55.933
My God, it's so much worse than I thought.

32:55.933 --> 32:57.434
<i>We told ourselves it was worth it</i>

32:57.768 --> 32:59.728
because he was
the most valuable CI the FBI ever had,

32:59.728 --> 33:02.481
but now he's eliminated
the bulk of his capacity

33:02.481 --> 33:04.900
to collect intel for us.

33:04.900 --> 33:08.112
Whatever his reasons,
we've earned an explanation.

33:08.112 --> 33:09.238
I just tried Raymond again.

33:09.238 --> 33:10.406
He's still not picking up.

33:10.406 --> 33:11.615
If I had to put money on it,

33:11.615 --> 33:12.825
I bet we never see him again.

33:13.325 --> 33:16.120
What do we tell Rutherford
and the interagency panel?

33:16.120 --> 33:17.371
<i>The truth,</i>

33:17.371 --> 33:19.248
or part of it.

33:19.581 --> 33:21.709
We tell them that
this intelligence network

33:21.709 --> 33:23.460
stretches across the globe.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.671
We give them details,
but we don't tell them

33:25.671 --> 33:27.256
<i>about Reddington's connection.</i>

33:27.256 --> 33:28.549
<i>At least not yet.</i>

33:28.549 --> 33:30.008
<i>There's too much in flux.</i>

33:30.008 --> 33:33.387
<i>For now, everyone go home
until we have more information.</i>

33:33.971 --> 33:36.348
<i>Personally I need a little time
to digest this.</i>

33:37.224 --> 33:39.601
Well, this seems a little different

33:39.601 --> 33:41.854
from what the judge's ruling said.

33:41.854 --> 33:45.691
Yeah, that's an understatement.

33:45.691 --> 33:48.152
This isn't a case of Reddington

33:48.152 --> 33:50.529
corrupting an FBI task force.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.739
He's a CI.

33:51.739 --> 33:54.700
That's all legally sanctioned
and approved from the top down.

33:54.700 --> 34:00.164
Our own government is protecting
the number one on its most-wanted list.

34:00.164 --> 34:01.957
Our government is protecting a man

34:01.957 --> 34:03.459
who's been spying on them.

34:03.459 --> 34:05.294
Can you rewind the tape?

34:05.294 --> 34:06.879
- I... I want to hear...
- Yeah.

34:06.879 --> 34:09.131
I think I know the part you mean.

34:09.131 --> 34:10.424
Yeah.

34:10.424 --> 34:11.967
<i>We offered him protection</i>

34:11.967 --> 34:15.137
<i>while he built out and strengthened
a vast criminal network.</i>

34:15.137 --> 34:18.682
<i>We've protected him while
he hardwired the US Capitol</i>

34:18.682 --> 34:21.435
<i>and intercepted a decade's
worth of state secrets.</i>

34:22.728 --> 34:25.397
<i>In a way, we've been
his partners in treason.</i>

34:27.775 --> 34:29.234
That's the one.

34:40.662 --> 34:43.040
I don't know why I'm not surprised.

34:43.957 --> 34:46.043
A drink, Harold?

34:46.043 --> 34:48.420
You look wrung out.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.172
That's astute of you.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.510
First things first.

34:54.843 --> 34:57.638
This has been you all along, hasn't it?

34:59.640 --> 35:03.435
You tricked us into
dismantling your empire

35:03.435 --> 35:05.687
the very thing that
makes our work possible.

35:06.355 --> 35:10.734
Morgana, room 417, Evelyn, all you.

35:11.693 --> 35:13.070
Yes, it is.

35:14.029 --> 35:16.031
But why have us shut you down?

35:16.949 --> 35:18.367
In my experience,

35:18.367 --> 35:21.370
when criminal organizations dissipate,

35:21.370 --> 35:25.165
their employees tend to seek
work with other criminals.

35:25.165 --> 35:27.876
But I wanted my people to be sent off

35:27.876 --> 35:31.380
to the happy retirement
they so richly deserve.

35:31.380 --> 35:33.215
To convince them to leave this life,

35:33.215 --> 35:37.469
they had to feel that
the FBI was on their tails.

35:38.595 --> 35:39.930
Thus, you.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.974
That's not what I asked you.

35:42.182 --> 35:44.101
Why shut down at all?

35:44.518 --> 35:47.271
This compromises your ability
to provide cases.

35:47.271 --> 35:49.857
Don't you realize
that endangers your immunity agreement?

35:49.857 --> 35:53.068
You and I both know
that's immaterial, Harold.

35:53.193 --> 35:54.820
I deleted my immunity agreement

35:54.945 --> 35:59.074
in its entirety when I tapped
into the Post Office archive.

35:59.074 --> 36:01.034
The Attorney General doesn't know that.

36:01.034 --> 36:03.787
The only reason we haven't
been directed to arrest you

36:03.996 --> 36:07.124
is because the government
is still acting as if you're our CI.

36:07.124 --> 36:09.960
That depends on you being
in a position to help us.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.795
By tearing down your empire,

36:11.795 --> 36:14.006
you're putting yourself in the crosshairs.

36:14.840 --> 36:18.260
Again, I ask you, why?

36:20.387 --> 36:23.515
Are you familiar with the assassination
of James Garfield?

36:24.349 --> 36:26.602
This country's 20th president, of course.

36:28.478 --> 36:30.939
Rather undervalued one in my view.

36:31.857 --> 36:35.569
He was shot by a crazy wannabe politician

36:35.569 --> 36:37.279
just across town on Constitution Avenue,

36:37.279 --> 36:39.031
in July 1881.

36:40.073 --> 36:42.451
Garfield survived for two months.

36:43.452 --> 36:44.995
As he lay slowly dying,

36:44.995 --> 36:47.497
the greatest scientific minds in America

36:47.497 --> 36:51.335
rushed to his side
to try to offer him succor.

36:52.794 --> 36:56.048
Navy engineers created an early version

36:56.048 --> 36:59.134
of the air conditioner
to keep his room cool.

36:59.134 --> 37:02.638
Alexander Graham Bell
tested his new design

37:02.638 --> 37:06.016
for a metal detector
to try to locate the bullet

37:06.141 --> 37:11.313
which had become lodged somewhere
in the President's abdomen.

37:11.313 --> 37:15.442
The doctors as well performed
a few experiments,

37:15.609 --> 37:18.695
including an innovative drainage tube

37:18.695 --> 37:20.572
to treat an abscess.

37:20.572 --> 37:23.033
Nonetheless, Garfield's temperature soared

37:23.283 --> 37:27.496
to a daily average of 104 degrees.

37:27.621 --> 37:29.414
The bullet was never found,

37:29.539 --> 37:32.459
and the drainage tube
created an infection

37:32.459 --> 37:34.211
that eventually killed him.

37:34.503 --> 37:37.464
Historians speculate that
if these great men of science

37:37.464 --> 37:40.384
had just left Garfield alone,
he might've lived.

37:40.384 --> 37:42.970
Or at least died peacefully.

37:45.389 --> 37:49.226
This is where you usually ask me
if I have a point.

37:51.228 --> 37:53.689
I'm tired of encouraging you.

37:55.023 --> 37:58.026
After a decade of obfuscation
and misdirection,

37:59.069 --> 38:00.779
even now when it matters most,

38:01.863 --> 38:04.199
you still can't give me a straight answer.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.411
I wish I could articulate one.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.454
Truly I do.

38:11.206 --> 38:15.210
I guess, the simplest way
of putting it is...

38:19.589 --> 38:20.966
Things end,

38:22.718 --> 38:26.555
sometimes despite our best
efforts and best intentions

38:27.180 --> 38:33.395
or sometimes because
of that effort or intent.

38:36.606 --> 38:37.941
Things end.

38:42.404 --> 38:44.239
So something else can begin.

39:17.355 --> 39:18.774
<i>This is Jonathan Pritchard.</i>

39:18.940 --> 39:20.400
<i>Leave your name and number,</i>

39:20.400 --> 39:21.777
<i>and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.</i>

39:22.486 --> 39:24.780
Jonathan, I know how hard
this has been,

39:24.780 --> 39:26.865
and Ressler's done a lot to help you.

39:26.865 --> 39:30.410
But thanks to you,
we now have definitive proof.

39:30.952 --> 39:34.414
Agent Ressler is a threat
to national security.

39:34.414 --> 39:36.875
He's endangering American lives.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.920
You'll be a hero for helping us stop him.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.072
Compliments of Mr. Reddington.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.786
To a wild ride, boys.

40:12.786 --> 40:15.080
- Yeah, to a wild ride.
- Yeah, to a wild ride.

40:34.182 --> 40:35.809
Hey, you coming?

40:37.227 --> 40:39.604
Thought we'd try something new
instead of just,

40:39.604 --> 40:42.149
you know, pouring more coffee
down our throats.

40:42.149 --> 40:45.735
I found a new NA meeting just
a few blocks from here. You want to go?

40:46.611 --> 40:48.238
Yeah, sure, s-sounds good, man.

40:53.410 --> 40:55.954
<i>In a way, we've been
his partners in treason.</i>

40:56.413 --> 41:01.710
<i>Partners in treason.</i>

41:02.460 --> 41:03.712
<i>Treason.</i>

41:05.714 --> 41:06.756
<i>Treason.</i>

41:08.717 --> 41:09.801
<i>Treason.</i>
