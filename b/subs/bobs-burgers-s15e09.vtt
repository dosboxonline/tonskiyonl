08:11.550 --> 08:13.641
so we can get you back
to where you belong?

08:13.735 --> 08:16.310
Don't be scared.
I get it-- stranger danger.

08:16.404 --> 08:18.888
But here,
have some more chocolate.

08:18.907 --> 08:20.573
And now I just pick you up. Aah!

08:20.667 --> 08:22.058
No! Wait! Don't run away.

08:22.077 --> 08:25.078
I'm trying to help you,
you adorable idiot!

08:25.230 --> 08:26.579
[whimpering]
Mom! Dad!

08:26.732 --> 08:29.156
What's going on? Why are you
running? Are-are you okay?

08:29.251 --> 08:31.584
I just found a little puppy
out here all by itself.

08:31.737 --> 08:33.512
I think it's lost.
I tried to pick it up,

08:33.663 --> 08:35.572
but it was scared, so I fed it
some of my chocolate,

08:35.665 --> 08:37.574
but then it ran off,
and now it's gone!

08:37.592 --> 08:39.500
Wait, Gene.
You fed it chocolate?

08:39.594 --> 08:41.002
The-the dark chocolate?

08:41.021 --> 08:42.336
Yeah, he loved it. Weird, right?

08:42.356 --> 08:43.671
Maybe he's from Belgium.

08:43.765 --> 08:47.250
-Gene, chocolate is poisonous
for dogs.
-What?!

08:47.269 --> 08:49.010
And-and... and I think
dark chocolate is the worst.

08:49.029 --> 08:52.922
What?! Why would chocolate
be poisonous?! It's chocolate!

08:52.941 --> 08:54.424
Gene, what have you done?!

08:54.442 --> 08:56.276
You knew about
this chocolate thing?!

08:56.428 --> 08:57.777
No, but now that I do know,

08:57.929 --> 08:59.687
I would never feed a dog
chocolate. Are you insane?

08:59.781 --> 09:01.931
[sighs] Okay, we need
to find that puppy right now

09:02.025 --> 09:03.783
and help it somehow
so it doesn't die.

09:03.935 --> 09:06.786
I... Uh, just so
it-it will be okay.

09:06.863 --> 09:09.363
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh,
my God! I poisoned a puppy?!

09:09.457 --> 09:10.531
On Christmas.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.717
-I know it's Christmas!
-Sorry, sorry.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.782
-What do we do? What do we do?!
-Oh, okay, did you see

09:18.875 --> 09:19.999
which way he ran off? Or-or she?

09:20.060 --> 09:21.634
It's a boy. I saw his dinky.

09:21.728 --> 09:24.378
He was just flapping it around,
not a care in the world.

09:24.398 --> 09:27.381
And then I fed him chocolate and
he ran off across the street,

09:27.475 --> 09:28.792
and now he's gone!

09:28.885 --> 09:31.570
All right, let's go see
if we can find him. Go, go!

09:31.797 --> 09:33.071
What do we do once we find him?

09:33.222 --> 09:35.632
Looking it up while running.
It's not easy.

09:35.650 --> 09:37.150
Yeah, even when you do
those things separately,

09:37.302 --> 09:38.651
you aren't good at them.

09:38.804 --> 09:40.745
Gene, how-how big was the puppy?

09:40.897 --> 09:42.063
-Uh, this big?
-Okay.

09:42.157 --> 09:44.082
And how much chocolate
did you give it?

09:44.159 --> 09:46.142
-Uh... this much?
-Wait.

09:46.144 --> 09:48.903
-That's bigger than the dog!
-He loved chocolate!

09:48.922 --> 09:50.905
And he's not good
at knowing his limits!

09:50.924 --> 09:52.665
He ran that way to that corner!

09:52.818 --> 09:55.076
[Linda]
Everybody look around
and see if you can find him.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.836
-[Louise] Puppy?
-Here, puppy, puppy, puppy.

09:56.988 --> 09:58.412
-Here, puppy!
-Hey, puppy!

09:58.506 --> 10:00.581
-He's not here!
-Bob, what's your phone saying?

10:00.601 --> 10:03.526
Well, it looks like we're gonna
have to make it throw up

10:03.586 --> 10:06.271
in the next 30 minutes,
or it could be, uh...

10:06.498 --> 10:07.497
-[Gene] What?!
-[sighs]

10:07.499 --> 10:09.441
We're gonna need
a smaller hearse.

10:09.668 --> 10:12.259
-Aah!
-How do you make a puppy
throw up?

10:12.279 --> 10:14.279
-Show it a picture
of Dad's back moles?
-Louise.

10:14.430 --> 10:16.430
Should we just shove a finger
down its throat?

10:16.450 --> 10:17.449
Your father's finger?

10:17.676 --> 10:20.267
Um, it says
that doesn't work on dogs.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.011
Hmm. Hydrogen peroxide.

10:22.030 --> 10:23.270
Oh, turkey baster.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.772
Dad, this is no time to talk

10:24.791 --> 10:26.107
about
your beloved turkey basting.

10:26.184 --> 10:27.125
Get your head out of your ass!

10:27.276 --> 10:28.943
No, Tina.
You fill a turkey baster

10:29.037 --> 10:31.354
with hydrogen peroxide,
put it down the puppy's throat,

10:31.447 --> 10:33.114
squeeze,
and then hold their mouth shut.

10:33.208 --> 10:34.374
-Oh.
-Seems rude.

10:34.468 --> 10:35.800
Where are we gonna get
a turkey baster

10:35.877 --> 10:37.618
and hydrogen peroxide
around here?

10:37.712 --> 10:39.362
I... I'm not sure.

10:39.455 --> 10:41.197
Let-Let's just find
the dog first.

10:41.366 --> 10:42.215
Here, little puppy!

10:42.367 --> 10:44.033
I have more chocolate!

10:44.202 --> 10:45.885
-What?
-[Bob and Louise] Gene.
-No!

10:46.037 --> 10:47.053
What? He likes it!

10:47.205 --> 10:48.629
Oh, right! Damn it, I forgot!

10:48.649 --> 10:50.039
Okay, he's not here.

10:50.133 --> 10:51.541
Maybe we, um, split up?

10:51.559 --> 10:53.318
Some of us get back in
the hearse to cover more ground

10:53.469 --> 10:55.044
and some of us
keep going on foot

10:55.138 --> 10:57.138
to check in bushes
and yards and stuff?

10:57.232 --> 10:59.065
I call "not going
in the hearse." Who's with me?

10:59.217 --> 11:00.216
I was gonna... go in the hearse.

11:00.235 --> 11:01.217
-Same.
-Yeah, me, too.

11:01.236 --> 11:02.218
It's got a heater.

11:02.237 --> 11:03.720
And wheels that move you around.

11:03.813 --> 11:05.146
And just a nice energy.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.239
You know, minus the death.

11:06.408 --> 11:07.666
-Tina, you're coming with me.
-Wait, why me?

11:07.817 --> 11:09.893
Because I can't be a lady
walking around by myself

11:09.911 --> 11:11.336
on Brookside Drive on Christmas.

11:11.563 --> 11:13.396
-They'll think I'm selling it.
-Selling what?

11:13.489 --> 11:14.839
-Christmas cheer?
-Never mind.

11:14.991 --> 11:16.991
All right, it's been about
15 minutes since Gene poiso--

11:17.043 --> 11:19.752
a-accidentally overserved
the puppy.

11:19.905 --> 11:22.572
So we have 15 minutes to find it
and make it throw up.

11:22.665 --> 11:23.740
Uh, I'm setting a timer.

11:23.742 --> 11:25.016
I think my phone does that.

11:25.168 --> 11:26.426
Here, I'll do it.

11:26.578 --> 11:28.428
It'll take you 15 minutes
just to figure that out.

11:28.522 --> 11:29.412
I'm old.

11:29.431 --> 11:30.930
Okay. Call us if you find him

11:31.024 --> 11:32.840
and we'll call you
if we find him. Go!

11:32.859 --> 11:34.751
Not a contest,
but Team Hearse sucks!

11:34.769 --> 11:36.269
Team Walking rules!

11:36.345 --> 11:38.922
What kind of world is this
where chocolate can be deadly?!

11:38.940 --> 11:41.182
What else kills dogs?!
Rainbows?!

11:41.201 --> 11:43.443
Ice cream?! Love songs?!

11:43.595 --> 11:44.444
Um, raisins.

11:44.596 --> 11:45.945
What the hell?! Ugh!

11:46.039 --> 11:48.039
As if this Christmas
wasn't already terr--

11:48.191 --> 11:49.265
uh, terrific.

11:49.284 --> 11:50.767
-Which it was.
-Yep.

11:50.785 --> 11:52.268
Great Christmas all around.

11:52.287 --> 11:55.714
Hmm. Well, uh, do you remember,
did it have a collar on?

11:55.941 --> 11:57.440
No, just a red ribbon.

11:57.533 --> 11:58.532
A red ribbon?

11:58.626 --> 12:00.777
That must mean
somebody got a puppy

12:00.795 --> 12:02.536
as a present for Christmas?

12:02.630 --> 12:04.113
I thought
that was only in movies

12:04.207 --> 12:05.390
and insurance commercials.

12:05.541 --> 12:07.225
I didn't know
that really happened.

12:07.452 --> 12:09.285
That is so different
from our life.

12:09.304 --> 12:11.120
You mean
because we don't have insurance?

12:11.139 --> 12:12.472
Dad, do we have insurance?

12:12.624 --> 12:13.547
A teeny bit.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.733
Oh, look at that house.

12:14.884 --> 12:15.975
Oh, look at that house!

12:16.127 --> 12:17.902
-Oh, look at that house.
-Yeah, pretty.

12:18.054 --> 12:20.387
But, also,
should we focus on the dog?

12:20.482 --> 12:22.315
We can do both.
Just 'cause we're trying to find

12:22.467 --> 12:24.300
a dying puppy and
make it throw up doesn't mean

12:24.393 --> 12:26.244
we can't still have
a nice Christmas.

12:26.471 --> 12:27.804
True.

12:27.897 --> 12:31.398
So, you know, if you get through
all ten levels

12:31.567 --> 12:33.142
on the Color-tron,
it salutes you

12:33.236 --> 12:35.812
with ten flashes
of the last color you pressed.

12:35.905 --> 12:37.163
-How 'bout that?
-Oh.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.757
Did you ever get
all the way through?

12:38.833 --> 12:40.483
Oh, God, no.
You think I'd be here

12:40.576 --> 12:42.409
if I could get
all the way through? No.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.095
I'd be president of NASA
right now.

12:44.322 --> 12:46.823
It's a... cool game, Mom.

12:46.841 --> 12:47.932
-[Linda] Mm.
-[brakes squeak]

12:48.084 --> 12:49.842
-Any luck?
-No. No sign of him.

12:49.995 --> 12:51.418
We did get pretty cold
out here, though.

12:51.496 --> 12:52.586
How's the heater in there?

12:52.606 --> 12:54.514
Thriving.
I'm actually a little too warm.

12:54.666 --> 12:57.350
Ooh, it's starting to snow.
What do we do?

12:57.444 --> 12:59.685
I-I don't know,
but we're running out of time.

12:59.838 --> 13:02.522
This feels like a good "inside
the hearse" conversation.

13:02.674 --> 13:03.523
Um, guys?

13:03.675 --> 13:04.524
What, Gene?

13:04.676 --> 13:05.766
It's the puppy!

13:05.860 --> 13:06.692
[gasps]

13:06.845 --> 13:08.269
[Louise]
And I love him.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.103
I love him more than all of you.

13:09.197 --> 13:10.288
-Sorry.
-Same here.

13:10.515 --> 13:11.939
-I love him.
-Nope. Not as much as me.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.366
I also love him.
Not a competition.

13:13.518 --> 13:14.775
It is. I win. I love him more.

13:14.869 --> 13:18.021
Guys, stop. Let's all
just slowly get out of the car

13:18.114 --> 13:20.540
and then calmly spread out
and try and catch him.

13:20.692 --> 13:21.874
Not in a scary way.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.617
Is this dating advice
all of a sudden?

13:23.711 --> 13:25.136
Works for both.

13:25.288 --> 13:26.954
-[Linda]
It's okay, little puppy.
-[Tina] Hey, guy.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.881
-It's okay.
-What are you doing
in the middle of the street,

13:29.034 --> 13:29.957
-you little dum-dum?
-Stay. Stay.

13:30.051 --> 13:31.292
-Stay.
-[Louise] Oh, man, I just want

13:31.311 --> 13:33.127
to squeeze your ridiculous face.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.979
-Crap!
-Follow him!
-[Gene panting]

13:35.206 --> 13:37.982
At least we have our eyes
on the cute little bastard!

13:38.726 --> 13:40.543
[Bob]
Oh, no, I don't see him.

13:40.636 --> 13:41.878
He went into the yard

13:41.896 --> 13:43.637
with the most decorations
in the world in it.

13:43.731 --> 13:47.033
-[Tina] Too many?
-[Linda] There's never too many.
No, this is too many.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.905
[Bob]
Oh, God, we have five minutes
to find the puppy

13:52.982 --> 13:53.981
-and make it puke.
-This is like
the worst game show ever!

13:54.075 --> 13:55.391
Where is he?

13:55.410 --> 13:56.576
[Tina] There!
He's in that Christmas tree!

13:56.670 --> 13:57.910
[Bob]
All right.

13:57.987 --> 14:00.063
Slowly surround the tree
like it's no big deal.

14:00.156 --> 14:02.748
Guys, I've been thinking.
Who owns a puppy like<i> this</i>

14:02.825 --> 14:04.250
and lets it out of their sight?

14:04.344 --> 14:05.993
Also, this puppy
was a Christmas gift.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.661
They lost their puppy
on day one.

14:07.755 --> 14:10.348
-Louise, please focus.
-I'm so focused, Dad,

14:10.425 --> 14:13.334
I'm just saying that the owners
of this puppy don't deserve it

14:13.428 --> 14:16.079
and maybe somebody else does,
and their name is me.

14:16.097 --> 14:18.414
Okay, I'm gonna reach in
and grab him.

14:18.433 --> 14:19.415
[all shout]

14:19.434 --> 14:21.751
Oh, I'm blind. I am blind now.

14:21.920 --> 14:24.011
-Is he still there?
-Cannot see. No idea.

14:24.105 --> 14:25.771
[Linda]
He's still in there.
He's close to me.

14:25.866 --> 14:28.107
-[all shout]
-Stupid blinking lights.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.425
[coughs] Color-tron much?

14:29.518 --> 14:30.201
-Tina.
-Sorry.

14:30.428 --> 14:31.761
[Gene]
He's headed your way.

14:31.779 --> 14:33.520
[grunts]
Oh, I missed him.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.931
We know. We saw.

14:35.024 --> 14:36.949
It was like slow motion
but it was real life somehow?

14:37.102 --> 14:39.711
-[sighs] Yep. Thanks, Louise.
-Oh, look,

14:39.862 --> 14:41.045
he's running into that igloo.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.380
[Gene]
That's not his habitat!

14:42.607 --> 14:43.956
There's no other way out.
That's good.

14:44.109 --> 14:45.775
-Got to love igloos.
-But how do we get him?

14:45.777 --> 14:46.959
That opening's tiny.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.812
Well, luckily,
some of us are igloo-sized.

14:49.872 --> 14:51.964
Get in there, my little penguin.

14:52.117 --> 14:53.466
Hi. I'm Louise.

14:53.618 --> 14:56.135
I'm your soulmate
and I'm here to save you.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.753
What are they doing?

14:57.755 --> 14:59.288
-I don't know.
-Hello.

14:59.307 --> 15:01.641
Uh, there's a puppy
in that igloo.

15:01.793 --> 15:03.067
Uh, my son gave him chocolate,

15:03.294 --> 15:05.311
but, you know, he didn't know
that was bad, so...

15:05.463 --> 15:07.146
-Did you know?
-Nice lights, huh?

15:07.298 --> 15:09.407
-It's a little much.
-Got to love igloos, though.

15:09.558 --> 15:10.633
Merry Christmas.

15:10.726 --> 15:12.911
Oh, you are soft.
You are very soft.

15:13.138 --> 15:15.321
I want to make
a sweater out of you.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.656
-Um...
-Hello?

15:16.732 --> 15:20.143
Hi, uh, we're in your yard,
and you probably

15:20.311 --> 15:23.404
really didn't think I was about
to ask you this but, um,

15:23.423 --> 15:24.981
do you have a turkey baster
and a bottle

15:24.999 --> 15:26.591
of hydrogen peroxide
we could borrow,

15:26.668 --> 15:28.909
like, a-as soon as possible?

15:28.929 --> 15:30.319
Uh, I-I think we do.

15:30.338 --> 15:31.504
-Oh, we have two minutes.
-[shouts]

15:31.598 --> 15:33.339
Yeah, there's a puppy
in your igloo

15:33.491 --> 15:36.509
that we gave chocolate to and
we need to make him throw up.

15:36.661 --> 15:37.769
Stop telling everybody!

15:37.996 --> 15:39.586
Also, it was
a really cute puppy.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.105
Not that you should
only save cute puppies.

15:41.257 --> 15:42.498
But it makes you try harder.

15:42.517 --> 15:44.167
We'll go inside
and get those things.

15:44.185 --> 15:47.094
I guess I hope there really is
a sick puppy in there.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.505
-Why would we lie?
-Thank you. And hurry.

15:49.524 --> 15:50.673
Eh, but don't fall.

15:50.692 --> 15:51.857
We are bonded forever.

15:52.010 --> 15:54.010
We are closer than
any two creatures can be.

15:54.028 --> 15:56.120
Okay, let's go
make you throw up.

15:56.272 --> 15:57.771
Damn it,
I forgot how cute he was.

15:57.791 --> 15:58.864
Hang in there, little buddy.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.441
We're just waiting
for the nice lady

16:00.460 --> 16:02.293
to come back
with some very specific items.

16:02.445 --> 16:05.188
-Whoa, that was fast.
-Well, we'd like to get you
out of the yard

16:05.206 --> 16:06.280
as quickly as possible.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.556
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

16:07.558 --> 16:09.542
-Dad, hurry.
-All right, I-I...

16:09.694 --> 16:14.030
I'm just gonna, uh, pretend
like I am basting a turkey.

16:14.048 --> 16:16.457
And baste.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.475
[gulps]

16:17.702 --> 16:20.294
Oh, no.
Did we just double-poison him?

16:20.371 --> 16:22.538
-Why isn't it working?
-[stomach grumbles]

16:22.631 --> 16:25.374
Louise, I think you might want
to put him on the ground.

16:25.393 --> 16:26.876
-Oh, my God.
-[puppy retching]

16:26.894 --> 16:28.635
That is so much chocolate.

16:28.730 --> 16:30.637
I know. He loved it, okay?

16:30.657 --> 16:32.064
And some tinsel?

16:32.217 --> 16:33.883
Oh, great. Now that's there.

16:33.901 --> 16:36.552
Good boy. You feel better now?

16:36.571 --> 16:38.979
-Um, I want some of that.
-I'm coming in.

16:38.999 --> 16:41.815
[retches]
Kids, that puppy just puked.

16:41.835 --> 16:43.668
You mean<i> our</i> puppy just puked.

16:43.745 --> 16:45.003
Ooh, I like the sound of that.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.338
Should we talk names?
Ralph? Right?

16:47.490 --> 16:50.341
Kids, we cannot keep this dog.
It's not ours.

16:50.493 --> 16:51.584
But it's Christmas.

16:51.736 --> 16:53.569
And Mom always talks
about Christmas magic.

16:53.588 --> 16:55.829
Maybe Christmas magic
brought us this puppy?

16:55.998 --> 16:58.332
-Oh, honey.
-Oh, that's sweet.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.576
Do we have a plan
for picking this up?

17:00.595 --> 17:02.261
Oh, uh, we will do that.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.580
Can we borrow something
to clean it up?

17:04.715 --> 17:06.006
We-we don't have anything.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.084
Never mind. I'll just
cover it with a reindeer.

17:08.086 --> 17:10.102
[sighs]
We're really sorry, kids,

17:10.196 --> 17:12.697
that we couldn't give you
the Christmas that you wanted.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.516
And I'm sorry
that I'm not a banker.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.093
-Excuse me?
-Oh, here we go again.

17:17.186 --> 17:19.037
But we can have
the Christmas we wanted.

17:19.188 --> 17:21.781
With the dog. The owner's
not even looking for it.

17:21.933 --> 17:23.282
[man]
Oh, my God, is that our puppy?

17:23.434 --> 17:25.543
-Did you find our puppy?
-No!

17:25.694 --> 17:26.952
Oh, you found him.

17:27.047 --> 17:29.881
It's really him.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

17:30.108 --> 17:33.033
Oh, oh-- ah, he's going back
into the igloo.

17:33.127 --> 17:34.293
-What?
-Louise.

17:34.445 --> 17:36.796
Guess I got to go back in
and get him again.

17:36.964 --> 17:39.282
Could take a while, okay?
Hold my calls.

17:39.300 --> 17:40.725
What if it's your
business manager?

17:40.952 --> 17:42.226
[Louise]
Well, put him through!

17:46.399 --> 17:47.732
Louise, uh, I'm sorry, but you,

17:47.883 --> 17:49.567
you really have to come out
of there with the puppy.

17:49.794 --> 17:52.886
His, uh, person is here
to take him home.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.388
Counterpoint:
she stays in the igloo

17:54.407 --> 17:57.300
until this guy takes off
and we keep the puppy?

17:57.393 --> 17:58.651
Or we all move into the igloo?

17:58.745 --> 18:01.153
-Uh, no.
-Wait, is she really
not coming out?

18:01.247 --> 18:04.082
[Louise]
Just a second,
I am securing the puppy.

18:04.309 --> 18:07.159
Oh, gosh, you know, now that
I take a good look at it,

18:07.253 --> 18:08.494
this puppy's hideous.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.903
Are you sure you want it?

18:09.997 --> 18:11.255
I mean, there's
probably better ones.

18:11.407 --> 18:14.483
I'm sorry, my kids got
a little attached to the puppy.

18:14.577 --> 18:17.320
Hey, I understand.
He was a gift for my daughter.

18:17.380 --> 18:19.913
She's four.
I don't know how he got out.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.265
We didn't even know he was gone.

18:21.417 --> 18:24.751
And when we realized,
she just started crying.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.345
[Linda]
Aw, your poor little girl.

18:26.497 --> 18:28.848
[man]
Yeah, bedtime was tough.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.666
But if she wakes up
and her puppy is there,

18:30.759 --> 18:33.611
well, it'll be like
Christmas all over again.

18:33.804 --> 18:36.339
[sighs]
I got him out.

18:36.357 --> 18:37.431
Here.

18:37.525 --> 18:38.741
Wait.

18:40.436 --> 18:42.578
Here. Wait.

18:44.440 --> 18:45.790
Okay. Wait.

18:45.941 --> 18:48.126
-Nose to nose.
-Uh, Louise?

18:48.294 --> 18:49.185
Fine.

18:49.278 --> 18:51.111
Here. Here. Here.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.113
Here! Just take him!

18:53.133 --> 18:55.358
What's, uh, what's his name?

18:55.376 --> 18:57.860
Lil' Bark Bark.
Uh, my daughter named him.

18:57.953 --> 18:59.545
I have notes. It's fine for now.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.122
[kids]
Bye, Lil' Bark Bark.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.550
-Yeah, I don't like it.
-Thanks again, so much.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.126
And Merry Christmas.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.812
Merry Christmas.

19:07.963 --> 19:09.722
Should we scoop up
some of his throw up

19:09.874 --> 19:11.632
as a way to remember him?

19:11.726 --> 19:12.650
-Ooh, that'd be great.
-Okay.

19:12.801 --> 19:13.726
Tina, sweetie, no.

19:13.878 --> 19:14.968
Hey, sorry, I should...

19:14.988 --> 19:16.228
Uh, let-let me
give you guys something.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.880
-Oh. Whoa.
-[all gasp]

19:17.882 --> 19:19.565
-Holy sugar cookies.
-Oh, no.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.660
Uh, we-we can't
take money from you.

19:22.737 --> 19:23.977
Please. You saved our Christmas.

19:24.071 --> 19:25.979
I mean, my son gave
your dog chocolate

19:25.999 --> 19:28.574
and then we had to find him
and make him throw up.

19:28.726 --> 19:29.892
Your dog. Not my son.

19:30.061 --> 19:32.653
So, yeah,
y-your dog threw up over there

19:32.672 --> 19:34.079
and right over there.

19:34.232 --> 19:35.581
H-He threw up a lot.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.917
Okay, well,
you've had an interesting night.

19:38.069 --> 19:41.328
-Yes, we have.
-Still, you got
my little girl's dog back.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.255
And you saved him
from the poison

19:43.391 --> 19:45.408
that you gave him,
so you're heroes.

19:45.576 --> 19:48.244
-Please, take it.
-[sighs] It feels weird.

19:48.262 --> 19:49.670
Nope, nope. Not weird. Good.

19:49.764 --> 19:52.172
I actually won that
at the office Christmas party.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.192
I guessed how many lollipops
were in the jar.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.252
-I work at a bank.
-Oh, my God.

19:56.270 --> 19:57.678
And this is what I want to do
with the money.

19:57.772 --> 19:59.179
Hey, life is short.

19:59.273 --> 20:01.090
Did you know there's a hearse
parked around the corner?

20:01.108 --> 20:03.442
I just passed it.
Really made me think.

20:03.594 --> 20:06.111
Oh, yeah, I saw it, too.
We didn't drive it here.

20:06.264 --> 20:08.781
Well, I'm gonna walk away now.
Thanks again.

20:08.933 --> 20:10.190
Merry Christmas.

20:10.284 --> 20:13.085
So, what should we do with it?
Don't say "pay bills."

20:16.549 --> 20:17.623
[speaking inaudibly]

20:17.775 --> 20:19.533
There's your Christmas magic.

20:19.702 --> 20:23.036
[sighs] I can't tell if it's
magic or if it was just money.

20:23.130 --> 20:25.448
No, it's not money.
There was crazy cosmic

20:25.466 --> 20:27.374
Christmas stuff going on
all over the place last night.

20:27.543 --> 20:29.618
We stepped right in it,
in a good way,

20:29.712 --> 20:31.545
with the lights and the hearse
and the chocolate

20:31.639 --> 20:33.731
and the banker,
and now our kids are smiling.

20:33.958 --> 20:35.549
That's Christmas magic.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.810
I'm gonna start giving chocolate
to every puppy I see.

20:37.886 --> 20:39.386
-We're gonna be rich.
-Gene.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.846
Just let us poison
enough puppies to get

20:40.907 --> 20:43.632
a little more money to buy
a few more games for this thing.

20:43.651 --> 20:44.742
They're expensive.
