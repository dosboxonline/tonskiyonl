WEBVTT

00:51.134 --> 00:53.635
Stay down. Just stay down.

01:04.980 --> 01:07.649
Freeze! Just freeze.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.692
Your hands ever shake, Frank?

01:50.985 --> 01:52.277
Sometimes.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.030
It's just adrenaline.

02:01.204 --> 02:04.164
Of course. How did you know?

02:04.791 --> 02:07.209
- Saw him washing the car.
- So did I.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.628
They don't wash cars
on the parking levels.

02:19.013 --> 02:22.141
Frank, I'd like you to stay on.

02:23.351 --> 02:26.145
I'm no good in a permanent position.

02:26.479 --> 02:28.397
My feet would go to sleep.

03:32.462 --> 03:35.422
Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!

03:35.590 --> 03:36.798
Rachel!

03:49.395 --> 03:52.856
Just walk away Renee

03:53.107 --> 03:55.817
You're turning down 2000 bucks a week?

03:58.279 --> 04:02.324
You're saying you won't protect Rachel
Marron because she's in show business?

04:02.575 --> 04:05.077
- I don't do celebrities.
-2500.

04:05.245 --> 04:09.456
There's several good men available for
that kind of money. Have you talked to...

04:09.666 --> 04:11.833
...Racine? Fitzgerald?

04:12.335 --> 04:15.337
- Portman?
- Yeah, Portman was interested.

04:15.505 --> 04:18.173
But we heard that you were the best.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.676
There's no such thing.

04:21.344 --> 04:25.681
We're talking about a frightened lady
with an 8-year-old son.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.892
I wouldn't be here
if this wasn't real.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.563
Farmer, she begged me to get you.

04:34.482 --> 04:39.152
- Please, Farmer. Just give me...
- All right, I'll come. Okay?

04:39.362 --> 04:41.530
I'll look the situation over.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.033
If I take it...

04:45.201 --> 04:46.493
...it's 3000 a week.

04:47.870 --> 04:51.248
You must be very deadly
for three grand a week.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.041
Watch and see.

04:57.755 --> 05:00.757
- Hm.
- Shit! I know it's something...

05:03.678 --> 05:05.053
Hey!

05:05.221 --> 05:07.055
Sorry.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.102
Better not stand there either.

06:02.945 --> 06:04.237
Yes?

06:04.405 --> 06:06.740
Frank Farmer to see Miss Marron.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.742
What?

06:10.453 --> 06:13.121
Alexander Graham Bell
to see Miss Marron.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.540
Got an appointment?

06:20.088 --> 06:24.424
Yeah. The atomic number of zinc is 30.

06:25.134 --> 06:26.301
All right.

07:33.411 --> 07:34.911
Yeah, can I help you?

07:37.498 --> 07:39.124
You the man on the intercom?

07:39.834 --> 07:42.210
No. Can I help you?

07:43.212 --> 07:45.630
My name's Edison.
I have an appointment.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.174
Uh-huh.

07:47.341 --> 07:49.009
That was arranged by...?

07:49.510 --> 07:50.969
Mr. Devaney.

07:51.929 --> 07:54.431
Oh, okay.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.099
Go right ahead, Mr. Edison.

07:56.392 --> 07:57.767
What happened to your arm?

07:59.645 --> 08:01.146
A doll.

08:15.953 --> 08:17.037
Yes?

08:17.205 --> 08:19.039
Henry Ford to see Mr. Devaney.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.875
- Who?
- Henry Ford.

08:22.627 --> 08:23.793
Come in, please.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.661
Playback.

09:40.496 --> 09:41.997
Yeah!

09:43.916 --> 09:45.917
That's what I'm talking about.

09:46.961 --> 09:50.171
Glad you came.
Come on, I'll introduce you to Rachel.

09:50.339 --> 09:51.381
Tony!
- Huh?

09:51.549 --> 09:53.383
Did you love it?
- Yeah.

09:53.634 --> 09:56.970
He doesn't know great art.
- Rachel, Frank Farmer's here.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.972
You think this is me?
- Terrific.

10:00.349 --> 10:01.558
- Frank Farmer's here.
Who?

10:01.726 --> 10:03.476
Frank Farmer. The bodyguard.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.687
I think Rory should be my bodyguard.

10:07.064 --> 10:09.691
Raise your butt out of there
and come meet him.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.945
All right, I'm up.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.034
Frank Farmer...

10:19.493 --> 10:20.535
...Rachel Marron.

10:24.081 --> 10:26.041
Hello.
- Hi.

10:27.084 --> 10:29.794
You don't look like a bodyguard.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.713
What'd you expect?

10:32.214 --> 10:34.007
I don't know,
maybe a tough guy.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.052
This is my disguise.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.262
Mm.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.764
His timing's good.

10:41.557 --> 10:44.934
This is Nicki, Rachel's sister
and personal secretary.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.728
NICKl:
Nice to meet you, Mr. Farmer.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.813
Tony Scibelli.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.899
Sy Spector, Rachel's publicist.

10:53.235 --> 10:54.486
Can we get you a drink?

10:55.196 --> 10:56.571
An orange juice.

10:57.156 --> 10:58.198
Straight?

11:02.119 --> 11:03.203
Yeah.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.372
Nicki.

11:06.624 --> 11:10.835
This whole thing is Bill's idea,
a sudden obsession with protecting me.

11:11.712 --> 11:14.214
Tony's always done my security
and we've done just fine.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.715
Is this what you meant?

11:15.883 --> 11:18.510
Bill's right, Rachel.
It's time you took more precautions.

11:18.678 --> 11:22.806
Nicki, Nicki. I'm sure the number
of nuts writing fan letters...

11:23.057 --> 11:25.600
...jumps whenever Rachel's
on a magazine.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.853
- Not like this.
- Relax, guys. Relax!

11:29.105 --> 11:33.274
I said I'm gonna do it and I'm gonna do it.
See what I'm dealing with here?

11:33.526 --> 11:36.194
I'll do it, as long as
we understand each other.

11:36.570 --> 11:41.449
- I'm not gonna let this thing alter my life.
That won't be a problem.

11:41.701 --> 11:45.370
Rachel runs a very informal household.
We're on a first-name basis.

11:45.621 --> 11:48.123
I'm sure you'll fit in fine.
You can choose...

11:48.374 --> 11:52.043
...the alarm system for the house,
improved security for the gate.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.294
What else? Rachel.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.296
What else?

11:55.715 --> 11:58.466
Well, I think I'm safe
when I'm here at the house.

11:58.676 --> 12:01.386
- So the main thing is when I go out.
- Yeah, exactly.

12:01.595 --> 12:05.890
Tony will fill you in. I don't want you
falling over me everywhere I go.

12:06.142 --> 12:09.769
The most important is that
Fletcher cannot be affected by this.

12:10.020 --> 12:13.606
I was going to cover that. We'll tell
the boy you've got some other function.

12:13.774 --> 12:17.652
I don't want him to think he's in prison,
so the house must not be altered.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.195
He shouldn't know you're here.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.364
- Miss Marron.
Rachel.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.367
There's been a misunderstanding.

12:24.618 --> 12:27.537
If you'll show me the way out,
I'll save us a lot of trouble.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.330
You can go by the pool.

12:32.209 --> 12:33.585
It was nice meeting you.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.087
Or the door on the end.
- Tony, shut up!

12:36.255 --> 12:37.422
Farmer, wait a minute!

12:37.590 --> 12:40.175
We shouldn't be begging this guy
for his services.

12:40.342 --> 12:43.762
Sy, I'm handling this.
Farmer, would you wait a minute?

12:46.474 --> 12:50.351
I should have told you more. I was afraid
you wouldn't go through with it.

12:50.519 --> 12:54.063
- I thought I'd let you two work it out.
- We did.

12:54.315 --> 12:58.485
She's not a bad person. Whether
she knows it or not, she needs you.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.529
You've come this far.
Just wait here for a minute.

13:01.697 --> 13:03.615
I want to show you something.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.035
- Please, Farmer!
- All right.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.810
Hi.
- Hi.

13:31.977 --> 13:33.561
How are you today?

13:34.814 --> 13:36.481
I'm fine. How about yourself?

13:37.066 --> 13:39.526
I'm fine. Do you like boats?

13:40.027 --> 13:41.653
Uh...

13:42.321 --> 13:44.239
No, I don't like boats.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.784
- Why not?
- I don't know.

13:48.035 --> 13:51.412
Sure you do.
But you don't want to tell me.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.623
You're a pretty smart kid.

13:55.960 --> 14:01.256
One time I was stuck on a boat
with some people for four months.

14:01.423 --> 14:02.590
A lifeboat?

14:02.758 --> 14:06.761
No. It was a big, white yacht.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.722
You're the bodyguard, aren't you?

14:09.974 --> 14:11.432
What do you know about it?

14:11.851 --> 14:13.351
I've got ears.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.729
I'll remember that.

14:20.484 --> 14:22.902
This is just in the last six months.

14:23.612 --> 14:26.739
Have you ever tried having these
professionally assessed?

14:27.575 --> 14:30.952
- Bill said you were in the Secret Service.
- That's right.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.413
Ever guard the main man?

14:34.582 --> 14:37.208
I was two years with Carter,
four with Reagan.

14:37.459 --> 14:38.877
Reagan got shot.

14:41.463 --> 14:42.714
Not on my shift.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.466
That's good.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.510
This could be something.

14:49.847 --> 14:53.182
You think it could be the same guy
who rigged the doll?

14:53.976 --> 14:56.394
I don't know.
Did you tell Miss Marron about it?

14:58.022 --> 14:59.439
Does she know about the doll?

14:59.648 --> 15:04.235
We said there'd been some
electrical problem, a short circuit.

15:05.696 --> 15:09.198
I mean, she doesn't need this kind
of worry right now. This would upset her.

15:10.117 --> 15:11.367
What about the police?

15:11.619 --> 15:13.578
There was no need.
No one got hurt.

15:13.829 --> 15:15.997
What about the chauffeur?
He got hurt.

15:16.165 --> 15:19.667
That was nothing.
It was just our people there.

15:21.211 --> 15:23.755
Sy, I think we should
show him the room.

15:23.964 --> 15:27.091
Share my life

15:27.259 --> 15:32.013
Take me for what I am

15:33.057 --> 15:36.392
'Cause I'll never change

15:36.560 --> 15:39.187
All my colors for you

15:40.522 --> 15:41.689
Is this her bedroom?

15:41.857 --> 15:43.483
- Yeah.
- No.

15:44.401 --> 15:50.114
She sleeps in a room next to Fletcher's.
Sy had this done for a magazine layout.

15:50.366 --> 15:53.534
"Superstars in their boudoirs. "
Did you see it?

15:54.411 --> 15:55.703
No.

15:56.455 --> 15:57.914
We found the letter here.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.336
Someone was in here?

16:03.587 --> 16:06.631
Somebody broke in
and masturbated on the bed.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.387
- She doesn't know this either.
You kidding?

16:12.638 --> 16:14.389
This would really freak her out.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.182
What do you think?

16:17.768 --> 16:19.185
Well...

16:19.353 --> 16:24.565
Someone penetrates the house,
gets upstairs, jerks off on the bed.

16:25.484 --> 16:28.444
- I'd say that qualifies as a problem.
- We don't need this, Bill.

16:28.612 --> 16:31.823
What kind of problem?
The house is wide open.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.741
Excuse me?

16:33.909 --> 16:35.660
The house is wide open.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.706
You people have no clue what security is
or what it takes to achieve it.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.166
Just tell me how
and I'll accommodate you.

16:42.418 --> 16:45.253
- I can't protect her like this.
- Like what?

16:46.255 --> 16:49.924
I won't be responsible for her safety if
she doesn't understand what's going on.

16:50.175 --> 16:53.136
I'll talk to her.
I'll make her understand.

16:53.303 --> 16:54.554
Bill.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.806
I'll talk to her.

17:04.815 --> 17:07.442
She won't give you static.
You got my word.

17:07.608 --> 17:08.818
Sure she will.

17:10.738 --> 17:14.281
So, what job's perfect?
You're a bodyguard, aren't you?

17:15.034 --> 17:16.325
Yeah.

17:19.621 --> 17:26.002
I have nothing, nothing, nothing

17:26.170 --> 17:32.800
Don't make me close one more door

17:34.303 --> 17:37.972
I don't wanna hurt anymore

17:38.140 --> 17:42.060
Stay in my arms if you dare

17:42.227 --> 17:44.520
It's Oscar time again.

17:44.688 --> 17:47.982
This year, the smart money's
on Rachel Marron for best actress.

17:48.233 --> 17:52.987
With the theme song from her last movie,
"I Have Nothing," still big on the charts...

17:53.238 --> 17:55.656
...it looks like
the versatile actress/singer...

17:55.824 --> 17:58.951
...could soon end up
actually having everything.

17:59.411 --> 18:03.164
...nothing, nothing

18:03.332 --> 18:08.544
If I don't have you

18:08.712 --> 18:12.131
You

18:23.977 --> 18:25.686
Why'd you say your name
was Edison?

18:25.896 --> 18:28.689
I wanted to see how difficult
it was to get in.

18:29.358 --> 18:32.276
- And it wasn't, was it?
- No.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.829
Here.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.873
- Put it on your arm.
- What's this?

18:46.041 --> 18:47.834
It'll help with the ache.

18:53.841 --> 18:58.386
I bet you can fill a whole day washing
cars and driving Miss Marron around.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.096
Well, that's my job.

19:01.890 --> 19:04.350
- We're adding to your duties.
- Huh?

19:04.518 --> 19:06.936
We're adding to your duties.
You're my new assistant.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.231
Says who?

19:11.525 --> 19:14.318
Henry, I've spent a lot
of time guarding people...

19:14.486 --> 19:16.737
...and I've found one thing to be true.

19:16.989 --> 19:21.242
No matter how incompetent the
assassins or how much they miss...

19:22.077 --> 19:23.911
...one person always gets hit.

19:25.414 --> 19:26.455
Who?

19:28.250 --> 19:29.625
The cocky black chauffeur.

19:32.462 --> 19:34.172
Put this in the pool.

19:46.059 --> 19:50.021
This gate will be replaced next week.
I'll have two cameras here.

19:50.272 --> 19:55.610
A face camera by the call box and a scene
camera on top of this pillar, looking down.

19:55.861 --> 19:59.363
I want these trees cut back
so the lights can shine onto the property.

19:59.531 --> 20:00.573
Okay.

20:00.824 --> 20:05.244
The people who cut the property,
make sure we know who they are.

20:08.332 --> 20:10.291
I want these all cut back.

20:10.542 --> 20:14.629
Miss Marron's paid enough for the
property, she ought to be able to see it.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.300
- Hey, what you looking at?
- Frank.

20:19.843 --> 20:25.473
Fence is gonna come in all around
this particular area and end by the gate.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.850
Come on. Let's go.

20:30.687 --> 20:33.231
Not yet, not yet.
Not yet.

20:33.398 --> 20:34.732
Now brake!

20:38.320 --> 20:39.695
Power...

20:40.656 --> 20:42.281
...and stop.

20:46.453 --> 20:49.664
Ooh, call me, babe

20:51.500 --> 20:54.627
Someday, someway

20:54.795 --> 20:57.505
'Cause I...
I never wanted anyone

21:06.807 --> 21:08.266
Come here!

21:09.017 --> 21:10.351
Come here.

21:10.852 --> 21:12.186
That's a...

21:12.354 --> 21:17.191
That's an unusual tactic
for a guard dog, but it's effective.

21:17.693 --> 21:20.152
You can take a look around
if you want.

21:20.821 --> 21:24.615
- Sorry to disturb you.
- It's all right. It's an excuse to rest.

21:25.367 --> 21:28.828
This is my personal place.
I'm the only one who works out around here.

21:33.625 --> 21:34.875
Oh.

21:35.043 --> 21:37.962
My own ego wall.
No platinum records.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.091
Is this you and Rachel?

21:42.259 --> 21:44.093
NICKl:
Mm-hm.

21:44.261 --> 21:47.263
When I was a kid,
I put together this little band.

21:47.514 --> 21:50.141
We played school dances
and stuff like that.

21:52.185 --> 21:57.148
Rachel joined the act. As you can
imagine, she was quite an entertainer.

21:59.359 --> 22:02.194
Even then, she had a way
of stopping the show.

22:02.612 --> 22:04.780
So I kind of quit.

22:05.032 --> 22:08.367
- Professionally, anyway.
- You never went back?

22:08.660 --> 22:11.829
It was pretty obvious
who the star in our family was.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.880
A lot of work went into this.
A lot of work.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.506
No fingerprints, though.

22:23.175 --> 22:27.303
- You think this is tied to the doll?
- That's what her manager thinks.

22:27.554 --> 22:32.350
This "I have nothing" thing is a natural,
given the record, the movie and all that.

22:37.773 --> 22:40.066
I lost track of you after Washington.

22:40.233 --> 22:41.859
Yeah.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.112
So how's the private stuff?

22:45.989 --> 22:47.406
It's fine.

22:47.657 --> 22:48.699
Big money, huh?

22:49.326 --> 22:50.534
Huh?

22:50.702 --> 22:52.411
It's big money, right?

22:52.954 --> 22:54.830
You wouldn't want this job, Ray.

22:56.958 --> 23:00.294
It's big money. Fuck. I knew it.
You need an assistant?

23:00.545 --> 23:04.382
I'm due to get out of here,
and I have had it with assholic behavior.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.801
What a scumbag we're covering now!

23:07.052 --> 23:10.304
A walking schlong senator
who shall remain nameless.

23:10.555 --> 23:14.809
- Hellfire Henry Kent.
- Shh. Someone wants to pop him.

23:14.976 --> 23:17.603
No surprise, with what
the shithead's been saying.

23:17.854 --> 23:19.814
Yeah, do everyone a favor.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.316
As you know,
we're non-political these days.

23:22.484 --> 23:23.818
Hey.

23:24.653 --> 23:29.031
I'll send it to Behavioral Sciences.
I'll have an answer in a couple days.

23:29.282 --> 23:30.366
Thanks.

23:30.784 --> 23:34.662
Ray, why am I getting
all this cooperation?

23:34.955 --> 23:37.373
- Are you kidding?
- She's a big star.

23:37.624 --> 23:39.166
Important people care about her.

23:39.334 --> 23:43.796
Frank, politics and showbiz,
it's the same thing these days.

23:43.964 --> 23:45.172
Well, thanks.

23:51.638 --> 23:52.721
- There she is.
- Oh.

23:52.973 --> 23:54.890
- Can I have your autograph?
No, hon.

23:56.184 --> 23:58.394
- Sure you can.
We're you're greatest fans.

23:58.562 --> 24:01.355
Do you mind if we get a picture?
She'll be so pleased.

24:01.523 --> 24:04.817
You're her favorite actress.
We've seen all your movies.

24:05.068 --> 24:06.235
Take a good one.

24:10.073 --> 24:13.451
Thank you so much.
She'll really appreciate it.

24:16.746 --> 24:19.081
I'm surprised you didn't plug them.

24:36.516 --> 24:41.645
Help me with this stuff. You sign
"Much love, Rachel" and you sign...

24:42.856 --> 24:45.566
Let me set you straight
about a few things.

24:47.903 --> 24:50.571
For starters, I love this lady.

24:51.781 --> 24:53.824
What I do for her, I do out of love.

24:54.618 --> 24:58.829
I'm not some hired fucking gun
who's here to make her life miserable.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.748
I do things the way she likes.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.792
Her happiness is everything to me.

25:04.711 --> 25:07.796
No problem. I'd like to know
how you handle things.

25:08.048 --> 25:12.259
I handle things fine. You watch me
and you'll learn something.

25:12.802 --> 25:14.303
Turn right here.

25:15.847 --> 25:16.889
Is that him?

25:17.140 --> 25:18.474
What's going on?

25:18.725 --> 25:20.017
Short cut.

25:20.393 --> 25:21.894
Want me to do a 180?

25:22.145 --> 25:24.188
No, 180. I want you to slow down.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.243
Take the car up to the house!

25:44.417 --> 25:45.709
Hey!

26:16.491 --> 26:22.162
I wanna run to you, ooh

26:23.123 --> 26:27.084
I wanna run to you

26:29.588 --> 26:32.590
Won't you hold me in your arms

26:32.757 --> 26:35.676
And keep me safe from harm?

26:35.844 --> 26:40.306
I wanna run to you, ooh

26:46.521 --> 26:49.857
Shut up! Shut up!
Just shut up!

26:51.651 --> 26:53.277
He's through messing with my life.

26:53.445 --> 26:58.032
I'm getting sick of running up here
every time he steps on your toes.

26:58.742 --> 27:01.035
Farmer, would you come in here?

27:04.164 --> 27:07.583
Did you know he was nuts?
- You know who couldn't get in yesterday?

27:08.209 --> 27:09.752
- Who?
- Robin Leach.

27:12.172 --> 27:15.341
He speaks to 20 million people
and he can't get in!

27:15.508 --> 27:16.717
Did he have an appointment?

27:16.885 --> 27:21.513
What's this about brunch at Charlie's?
She's been going every Sunday for five years.

27:21.681 --> 27:24.099
I don't want her doing
what she's always done.

27:24.351 --> 27:27.436
"I don't want her doing
what she's always done. " He's a fanatic!

27:27.687 --> 27:31.440
- So are the guys he's protecting you from.
- Excuse me if I don't faint.

27:31.608 --> 27:33.317
Think about your son.
What about Fle...?

27:38.698 --> 27:40.074
What do you want?

27:40.325 --> 27:42.618
- I want some peace around here!
- That's right.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.453
Frank.

27:45.705 --> 27:47.373
We're almost done.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.876
And I want to eat brunch with my friends.

27:51.169 --> 27:52.378
Go on Tuesdays.

27:54.005 --> 27:57.216
Tuesday-morning brunch.
Where'd you get this guy, Bill?

28:04.808 --> 28:07.017
Louise, you've got too much great stuff.

28:07.394 --> 28:08.852
Take it all, darling.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.480
Yeah, I'll try this on.

28:12.607 --> 28:14.066
Hey, Farmer.

28:14.651 --> 28:16.235
Want to come in here with me?

28:16.778 --> 28:18.362
Just to be safe?

28:28.748 --> 28:31.458
You probably won't believe this...

28:32.210 --> 28:35.212
...but I have a reputation
for being a bitch.

28:40.176 --> 28:41.969
I didn't used to be.

28:42.512 --> 28:46.348
Get known for being a certain way,
a way people think you are...

28:47.267 --> 28:49.893
...and soon, you get like that.

28:50.854 --> 28:52.646
Guess you can't help it.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.361
Oh, so you don't think so?

29:00.363 --> 29:02.406
You're an expert
on famous people, huh?

29:02.657 --> 29:05.909
- I've seen a few.
- And you disagree?

29:06.870 --> 29:09.163
You can be as you choose to be.

29:09.497 --> 29:12.040
It's an act of discipline,
but it can be done.

29:12.792 --> 29:15.502
Is that why you never stay
with one of your clients?

29:15.754 --> 29:18.130
They too undisciplined for you?

29:18.548 --> 29:21.842
- Or maybe you start caring about them?
- That's right.

29:22.302 --> 29:24.219
Can't you answer straight just once?

29:25.513 --> 29:28.515
You're too clever for me. I can't keep up.

29:29.309 --> 29:30.726
Look at me, Farmer!

29:37.317 --> 29:39.109
You don't approve of me, do you?

29:40.862 --> 29:43.363
Disapproval's a luxury I can't afford.

29:43.615 --> 29:47.284
Gets in the way, right?
Don't like your emotions getting to you?

29:47.535 --> 29:49.536
Never mix business with pleasure?

29:50.580 --> 29:51.622
That's right.

29:53.208 --> 29:56.210
Will you grab that jacket for me?
The red one, please.

29:57.337 --> 30:00.172
I'm here to keep you alive,
not help you shop.

30:04.010 --> 30:05.552
Thanks.

30:13.978 --> 30:20.275
I know that when you look at me

30:20.443 --> 30:26.073
There's so much
That you just don't see

30:26.449 --> 30:28.075
- Two minutes.
- Three, four.

30:28.326 --> 30:31.286
Wait. I want to make it really full.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.205
Shh, shh, shh.

30:34.707 --> 30:35.999
What?

30:36.167 --> 30:38.669
...in my heart you'd find

30:38.837 --> 30:42.256
Oh, a girl who's scared sometimes

30:42.423 --> 30:45.259
Who isn't always strong

30:45.426 --> 30:48.011
Can't you see the hurt in me?

30:48.179 --> 30:50.931
Oh, I feel so all alone

30:51.099 --> 30:57.771
I wanna run to you, ooh

30:57.939 --> 31:03.944
I wanna run to you, ooh

31:04.571 --> 31:07.447
Won't you hold me in your arms

31:07.615 --> 31:10.492
And keep me safe from harm?

31:10.660 --> 31:15.789
I wanna run to you, ooh

31:16.916 --> 31:23.255
I wanna run to you, ooh

31:26.134 --> 31:27.759
Straight up.
Uh-huh.

31:27.927 --> 31:29.428
Right there. Hold it.

31:31.222 --> 31:32.556
Hold it still.

31:32.807 --> 31:34.474
What am I looking for?

31:34.684 --> 31:35.726
Bomb.

31:38.855 --> 31:40.647
Don't worry, I already checked.

31:41.107 --> 31:44.401
Put it back here a little deeper.
Hold it still.

31:44.694 --> 31:48.030
- Now turn it. Good. Now right there.
Oh.

31:48.615 --> 31:50.824
Wait, wait. Hold there for a second.

31:52.035 --> 31:53.744
Son of a bitch.

31:58.374 --> 32:00.000
I thought it was dinner.

32:01.544 --> 32:04.338
- Are we going somewhere else?
- The Mayan.

32:04.589 --> 32:07.633
- What's the Mayan?
- It's a club, Frank.

32:07.884 --> 32:11.929
- You have to tell me about these things.
- I just did.

32:13.514 --> 32:15.098
Nice suit, Frank.

32:15.850 --> 32:17.559
Rachel.

32:18.311 --> 32:20.228
I want you to keep this.

32:22.357 --> 32:23.941
It's beautiful.

32:24.609 --> 32:28.528
It has a radio transmitter. When you
close the clasp, it sends a signal.

32:28.780 --> 32:33.492
If there's ever a problem, press it.
I'll know you need me.

32:33.952 --> 32:37.204
Okay, she knows how it works.
Come on, let's get going.

32:43.586 --> 32:45.170
Come on, let's go.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.510
Look at this!

32:51.761 --> 32:54.846
Look at this, Rachel.
They didn't forget. They don't forget.

32:57.684 --> 32:58.892
Rachel!

32:59.686 --> 33:01.520
Rachel!

33:01.854 --> 33:04.356
Get inside. The show's inside.

33:04.607 --> 33:06.525
Henry, just keep the car moving.

33:11.698 --> 33:14.241
Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!

33:22.375 --> 33:25.127
Hey! Hey! Hey!

33:25.586 --> 33:27.587
How you doing up there?

33:27.797 --> 33:29.881
Rachel! Rachel...

33:30.466 --> 33:31.925
I'm a fan!

33:39.350 --> 33:41.810
He's from Paris, an amazing director.

33:42.061 --> 33:46.481
This is his first video. Rachel loves it.

33:47.275 --> 33:48.942
This is Sy's idea.

33:49.110 --> 33:51.820
- I honestly thought...
- You told me I had an exclusive.

33:52.071 --> 33:53.321
Maybe later. What can I say?

33:53.489 --> 33:54.531
- Hi.
- Laurie!

33:54.699 --> 33:56.658
- Hi.
- How are you? You know Paul.

33:56.826 --> 33:58.410
- I know.
- Speak to you later.

33:58.578 --> 34:01.955
She normally doesn't do these places.
He thinks it'll be good for the video.

34:16.219 --> 34:17.929
He sent another one.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.808
What do you mean "another one"?

34:25.563 --> 34:26.938
Bill, what do you mean?

34:27.106 --> 34:29.440
- They didn't tell you.
- Didn't tell me what?

34:30.650 --> 34:34.654
There were some letters before.
Same kind of threats.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.531
We didn't want to worry you.

34:36.783 --> 34:40.409
- And somebody got into the house.
- Someone was in my house?

34:40.661 --> 34:42.536
- Don't get hysterical.
- Let's get her out.

34:42.789 --> 34:45.373
Wait! While Fletcher was there?!

34:45.541 --> 34:47.375
The house is like Fort Knox.

34:47.543 --> 34:49.002
- Right, Frank?
- We should go.

34:49.253 --> 34:52.547
There's no way anyone could...
- Anyone could what?

34:52.799 --> 34:54.257
- Everyone calm down.
- Sy.

34:54.509 --> 34:57.761
Let's just see how she is.
How are you, honey?

35:07.105 --> 35:10.565
"Watch the door"
means no candy, no flowers.

35:11.025 --> 35:13.318
Do you think he's out there?

35:14.779 --> 35:16.905
- He's here, isn't he?
- He might be.

35:17.156 --> 35:18.865
We don't know that.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.826
But you know he was in my house!

35:21.077 --> 35:24.121
Let's go home. We'll have
to make an announcement.

35:24.288 --> 35:26.164
Fine, Bill, you make it!

35:26.415 --> 35:29.960
You tell them!
They'll tear the fucking place apart!

35:30.878 --> 35:34.714
Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!

35:36.717 --> 35:39.177
Ladies and gentlemen...
- Oh, my God. Rachel!

35:39.345 --> 35:44.224
...I'm sorry, but due to circumstances
beyond our control...

35:47.603 --> 35:48.895
Wait. Wait. Wait!

35:49.605 --> 35:51.731
Rachel, don't do it. It's not worth it.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.860
No fucking freak
is gonna run me off stage.

35:57.572 --> 35:59.906
Hey, get this video up front. Cued up.

36:00.074 --> 36:01.741
Let's go. We're on.

36:02.493 --> 36:04.786
- Change of plan. We're not coming.
- What?

36:08.082 --> 36:11.084
I'm afraid Rachel will not be able
to appear tonight.

36:18.885 --> 36:21.803
Just a minute. Give me a chance.

36:27.268 --> 36:29.436
Bill Devaney, everybody!

36:31.814 --> 36:34.149
Hello, hello, hello! Hello!

36:34.859 --> 36:35.984
Hello!

36:36.152 --> 36:39.237
Just wanted to stop by
and maybe sing a song.

36:40.531 --> 36:42.782
I hope you don't mind, do you?

36:43.201 --> 36:44.284
Yeah.

36:44.452 --> 36:46.870
All right, thank you so much!

36:47.121 --> 36:50.498
Isn't Billy Thomas the greatest?
Let's give him a hand.

36:50.791 --> 36:52.876
- Go for it, Rachel.
Come on.

36:54.837 --> 36:57.047
Want to see my new video?

37:13.272 --> 37:15.482
I've got the stuff that you want

37:15.650 --> 37:17.651
I've got the thing that you need

37:17.818 --> 37:22.364
I've got more than enough
To make you drop to your knees

37:22.531 --> 37:26.993
'Cause I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night

37:27.328 --> 37:31.706
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah

37:31.874 --> 37:34.584
Are we having a communication problem?

37:35.544 --> 37:38.338
- What?
- A communication problem? I mean...

37:38.881 --> 37:41.633
Excuse me.
I need to keep this aisle clear.

37:41.884 --> 37:43.718
I know what you're saying.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.762
You got a job to do.

37:45.930 --> 37:50.642
But understand that Rachel does too.
And that's what she's doing.

37:51.060 --> 37:52.102
Out there.

37:52.353 --> 37:56.064
I mean, look, she's so hot now.
This is her time.

37:56.232 --> 37:59.484
If she doesn't get out there, she's dead.

37:59.735 --> 38:02.737
Forget the crazy death threats,
if she doesn't sing...

38:02.989 --> 38:04.739
...she's dead anyway.

38:05.074 --> 38:07.993
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah

38:09.120 --> 38:13.331
Handled properly, this thing could be
worth a million in free publicity.

38:13.582 --> 38:14.749
- One word!
- Yeah, well it...

38:14.917 --> 38:17.460
- One word. One word in print about this...
- Yeah, okay...

38:17.628 --> 38:19.587
About anything...

38:19.755 --> 38:21.673
Queen of the night
Queen of the night

38:21.841 --> 38:23.383
Queen of the night

38:23.551 --> 38:26.886
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah

38:27.638 --> 38:31.891
You've got a problem
With the way that I am

38:32.226 --> 38:35.645
They say I'm trouble
And I don't give a damn

38:35.813 --> 38:39.566
But when I'm bad I know I'm better

38:40.234 --> 38:45.739
I just wanna get loose
And turn it up for you, baby

38:45.906 --> 38:49.409
I've got the stuff that you want
I've got the thing that you need

38:49.577 --> 38:54.080
I've got more than enough
To make you drop to your knees

38:54.248 --> 38:58.418
'Cause I'm the queen of the night
Queen of the night

38:58.961 --> 39:02.756
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah

39:39.168 --> 39:41.002
Come on!
Out of the way!

39:47.093 --> 39:48.176
Tony!

39:48.344 --> 39:50.470
- I'll take care of this!
Right there.

39:50.721 --> 39:52.097
Follow me!

40:01.482 --> 40:03.441
Where's the fucking limo?

40:10.991 --> 40:12.242
Go!

40:16.789 --> 40:17.956
Henry!

40:18.165 --> 40:19.791
It's me, Sy!

40:20.459 --> 40:21.835
Stop it!

40:22.086 --> 40:23.378
Fuck!

40:27.967 --> 40:29.592
Keep driving, Henry.

40:53.284 --> 40:54.701
Never done that before.

40:57.788 --> 40:59.497
It's been a long night.

41:48.339 --> 41:51.090
Don't you want to know
why I behaved that way?

41:52.384 --> 41:54.260
I know why.

43:59.762 --> 44:02.263
I don't want to talk about this again.

44:33.545 --> 44:34.921
Hey, got you, didn't I?

44:39.760 --> 44:41.719
Bet you're wondering what I'm doing.

44:47.393 --> 44:49.143
Didn't know I jog, did you?

44:49.853 --> 44:52.605
Afraid I'll get picked off
in my snazzy running suit?

44:53.148 --> 44:56.651
No, I'm afraid
that I'll have to jog with you.

45:00.781 --> 45:02.699
Will you walk with me a little?

45:07.705 --> 45:09.706
Look, I know this is kind of late...

45:10.290 --> 45:11.791
...but thank you.

45:12.334 --> 45:14.377
I'm really glad you're here.

45:15.045 --> 45:17.588
And I'm going to try to cooperate.

45:19.091 --> 45:21.175
That would be good.

45:24.596 --> 45:27.849
Farmer, I have this problem.

45:28.308 --> 45:30.601
This minor little problem.

45:30.853 --> 45:33.312
I'd like to go out for an evening.

45:33.522 --> 45:36.190
With a guy, you know. Like a date.

45:38.610 --> 45:41.904
But, I can't go out on a date...

45:42.156 --> 45:45.032
...because you have to be with me
every minute.

45:45.325 --> 45:50.413
What if he wants to invite me up
to his place? Will you come too?

45:52.666 --> 45:53.875
So...

45:54.835 --> 45:56.669
...the only thing I can figure...

45:57.546 --> 45:59.756
...is for you to take me out.

46:02.551 --> 46:05.219
That's what I was wondering.

46:06.096 --> 46:08.890
You know? I mean, what do you think?

46:09.141 --> 46:11.058
Only if you want to.

46:12.060 --> 46:13.770
Only if you want to.

46:15.022 --> 46:16.689
NICKl:
Rachel!

46:16.857 --> 46:19.192
God, this is so embarrassing.

46:20.110 --> 46:21.694
You decide, okay?

46:21.862 --> 46:24.489
- Yeah.
- Sandy Harris is on the phone.

46:24.656 --> 46:28.493
Tell her I'll call her back.
I'm getting fixed up here.

48:03.088 --> 48:05.756
He didn't look like
he wanted to die to me.

48:06.800 --> 48:09.552
There's a big difference
between wanting to die...

48:09.720 --> 48:11.679
...and having no fear of death.

48:13.307 --> 48:18.185
And so, because he had no fear of death,
he was invincible?

48:18.437 --> 48:20.062
What do you think?

48:20.939 --> 48:23.774
- He sure creamed them all in the end.
- Heh, heh, heh.

48:24.526 --> 48:26.611
- Yeah, it was a good movie.
- Yeah, it was good.

48:28.155 --> 48:30.448
How many times
have you seen that movie?

48:30.657 --> 48:32.283
Uh...

48:32.659 --> 48:36.787
- Sixty-two times, I think. Heh, heh, heh.
- Sixty-two times? Gosh.

48:36.955 --> 48:38.581
I've seen it a lot.

48:38.749 --> 48:40.583
- You can say that.
- I've seen it a lot.

48:56.892 --> 48:58.935
Another beer, sir?
- No. No, thanks.

48:59.186 --> 49:00.811
Your kind of place?

49:00.979 --> 49:02.355
Yeah.

49:02.564 --> 49:03.898
Your kind of music?

49:04.816 --> 49:06.400
Absolutely. Yeah.

49:08.111 --> 49:10.613
You figure no one
can get by you here, huh?

49:10.906 --> 49:15.326
If someone's willing to swap his life
for a kill, nothing can stop him.

49:17.162 --> 49:19.664
Great. What do I need you for?

49:19.915 --> 49:21.832
He might get me instead.

49:22.834 --> 49:24.919
You're ready to die for me?

49:25.754 --> 49:27.254
It's the job.

49:28.048 --> 49:29.632
And you do it?

49:31.802 --> 49:33.094
Why?

49:35.263 --> 49:36.806
I can't sing.

49:39.267 --> 49:44.271
Maybe there is some glory in saving
a president, but just anybody?

49:44.564 --> 49:45.606
Like you?

49:46.066 --> 49:47.566
Yeah, like me.

49:49.111 --> 49:51.195
It's a matter of conditioning
and discipline.

49:52.114 --> 49:53.990
I don't trust discipline.

49:54.282 --> 49:57.201
I know at that crucial moment
I'd cop out.

49:58.078 --> 49:59.453
It happens.

49:59.621 --> 50:02.289
Mm. But not to you, fierce Frank, huh?

50:02.708 --> 50:04.291
It happens.

50:07.838 --> 50:09.797
Have you ever liked anybody?

50:12.092 --> 50:13.300
What do you mean?

50:15.178 --> 50:17.471
Like me, a girl?

50:19.307 --> 50:21.392
Yeah, a long time ago.

50:21.727 --> 50:24.520
What happened?
Do you mind if I ask?

50:24.771 --> 50:26.105
Mind if I don't answer?

50:29.276 --> 50:30.651
I don't want to pry.

50:30.944 --> 50:32.945
Oh, yeah. I can see that.

50:36.616 --> 50:38.200
What? Heh, heh.

50:38.452 --> 50:40.995
She didn't die, did she?

50:42.456 --> 50:45.666
While you were protecting her
she got killed, right?

50:50.881 --> 50:53.215
God, that's not it, is it?

50:58.513 --> 51:00.723
That's it, isn't it?

51:01.975 --> 51:03.809
Nobody's perfect.

51:09.524 --> 51:11.317
I'm sorry, Frank.

51:12.235 --> 51:13.861
I'm sorry.

51:18.492 --> 51:19.992
No.

51:20.827 --> 51:22.745
Nice try, though.

51:25.415 --> 51:26.999
You... Frank.

51:28.835 --> 51:31.212
It was less dramatic than that.

51:32.339 --> 51:34.423
She didn't love me anymore.

51:35.383 --> 51:37.009
Can you imagine that?

51:39.763 --> 51:41.847
No, not really.

51:57.739 --> 51:58.864
So...

51:59.199 --> 52:02.034
...is this a full-service date, Frank?

52:07.791 --> 52:10.167
I'm just asking you to dance.

52:13.755 --> 52:14.839
Come on.

52:17.592 --> 52:19.301
You can dance, can't you?

52:21.721 --> 52:24.223
...in your way

52:24.391 --> 52:26.892
So I'll go

52:27.727 --> 52:29.436
But I know

52:30.730 --> 52:36.861
I'll think of you each step of the way

52:37.028 --> 52:46.078
And I will always love you

52:46.246 --> 52:52.001
Oh, I will always love you

52:54.337 --> 52:57.006
This is kind of a cowboy song, huh?

52:57.549 --> 52:59.300
Yeah.

53:01.261 --> 53:06.891
Bittersweet memories

53:09.269 --> 53:12.104
- What?
- Nothing. It's nothing.

53:13.690 --> 53:15.316
What?

53:16.943 --> 53:20.654
It's so depressing.
Have you ever listened to the words?

53:20.822 --> 53:26.952
We both know that I'm not
What you need

53:28.788 --> 53:31.540
- It is kind of depressing.
- Yes, it is.

53:32.751 --> 53:34.376
It's one of those...

53:34.544 --> 53:36.921
...somebody's-always-leaving-somebody
songs.

53:37.088 --> 53:38.839
Yeah.

53:48.141 --> 53:49.391
Don't worry.

53:51.269 --> 53:54.188
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

53:56.858 --> 54:06.492
Oh, I will always love you

54:06.660 --> 54:12.581
Oh, I will always love you

54:21.299 --> 54:23.175
It's very quiet here.

54:31.351 --> 54:33.227
You ever going to hang these up?

54:36.022 --> 54:37.815
Maybe when I'm here long enough.

54:38.233 --> 54:41.819
"West Virginia University Football. "

54:42.570 --> 54:43.862
God.

54:44.030 --> 54:45.406
Take a look at you.

54:46.533 --> 54:49.201
- What'd you play?
- End.

54:49.744 --> 54:51.370
Were you tough?

54:52.622 --> 54:54.456
No, I was fast.

55:03.550 --> 55:05.217
So you were in the Secret Service?

55:06.428 --> 55:07.636
What made you get out?

55:10.473 --> 55:11.890
Money.

55:13.852 --> 55:17.146
Yeah, I can see your tastes
are extravagant.

55:17.564 --> 55:18.605
May I?

55:20.150 --> 55:21.400
Yeah.

55:44.758 --> 55:46.258
Be careful.

56:21.628 --> 56:24.254
You're a hard one to figure out,
Frank Farmer.

56:30.053 --> 56:33.138
A bodyguard must know very little peace.

56:54.327 --> 56:55.994
Watch this.

57:42.375 --> 57:44.877
I've never felt this safe before.

57:48.047 --> 57:50.215
No one could get by you.

57:53.219 --> 57:55.721
Right now might not be too difficult.

58:32.926 --> 58:34.426
What are you doing?

58:38.264 --> 58:39.806
Frank?

58:41.142 --> 58:44.144
I don't want to get confused
about what I'm doing here.

58:44.938 --> 58:46.772
I'm not confused.

58:47.273 --> 58:49.983
You pay me to protect you.
That's what I do.

58:53.363 --> 58:57.783
- Have I done something wrong?
- No. Nothing.

58:59.118 --> 59:00.786
Then what is it?

59:03.373 --> 59:06.875
- Do you want me to beg?
- No.

59:17.804 --> 59:19.638
What's going on, Frank?

59:20.807 --> 59:23.475
I want to keep it straight in my head
what my job is.

59:23.685 --> 59:26.687
What is that, exactly?
Making me feel like shit?

59:27.063 --> 59:28.522
No.

59:29.649 --> 59:31.191
I'm sorry, this is my fault.

59:31.484 --> 59:35.237
Don't apologize. Just tell me
what I did. I'm a big girl.

59:35.488 --> 59:38.991
You didn't do anything. It was me.

59:39.993 --> 59:42.953
- I got involved with my client.
- Your client?

59:43.621 --> 59:45.789
- I made a mistake.
- Your client?!

59:45.957 --> 59:48.458
You're not attracted
to your client anymore?

59:48.751 --> 59:50.544
Christ, I told you why!

59:50.753 --> 59:51.795
I can't...

59:51.963 --> 59:53.797
I can't protect you like this.

59:57.760 --> 59:59.636
So that's it for me?

01:00:00.513 --> 01:00:02.806
That's it?

01:00:04.183 --> 01:00:05.267
Yeah.

01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:08.020
I don't believe it!

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:10.856
You can live with it,
or you can fire me.

01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:12.566
But I can't fuck you.

01:00:27.206 --> 01:00:29.833
She's real mad at you, isn't she?

01:00:31.836 --> 01:00:35.213
She doesn't understand why
you're being so shitty to her.

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:38.050
I don't like it when you use
language like that.

01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:50.145
I spent a lot of time learning not
to react to things like other people do.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:52.189
It's my job.

01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:55.150
It doesn't always work.

01:00:56.027 --> 01:00:57.861
Doesn't always work.

01:00:59.572 --> 01:01:01.365
I don't think I understand.

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:06.036
I'm an old man compared to you,
and I don't understand either.

01:01:06.579 --> 01:01:08.747
I'm starting to get the feeling...

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:10.791
...that I never will.

01:01:13.711 --> 01:01:14.920
NICKl:
Ta-da!

01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:18.173
Thought you'd like to know.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.761
Everyone said she was a sure thing.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.598
But you already knew that.

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:37.442
I am sorry. It was out of line,
none of my business.

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:41.029
Come on, buddy. Let's go.

01:01:51.833 --> 01:01:55.335
It's off to Miami today for
Best Actress nominee Rachel Marron.

01:01:55.586 --> 01:01:59.464
She'll give two AIDS charity concerts
at the Fontainebleau Hilton.

01:01:59.757 --> 01:02:01.633
A thousand a plate, no less.

01:02:01.926 --> 01:02:05.470
And it's a brave man who'd deny
the lovely lady was worth every cent.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:17.149
Mobile 1 to station 2. 02, engineering.

01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:21.486
Have them do a 14 reference
to presidential suite balcony right away.

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:27.159
It's okay. They're cleared.

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:30.162
Mobile 2 to Catering.

01:02:30.329 --> 01:02:32.914
Security requests main kitchen
aisle to be kept free...

01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:37.127
...of all obstructions on stage level,
effective immediately.

01:02:37.336 --> 01:02:38.837
Mobile 2 to front of house.

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:43.467
Security requests updated list of all
ticket holders for Rachel Marron concert.

01:02:43.676 --> 01:02:48.221
Please fax any names which are added
to the list to Security Office.

01:02:50.516 --> 01:02:52.809
What a silly job this is.

01:02:54.729 --> 01:02:56.396
Okay, we're rolling!

01:02:56.647 --> 01:02:58.815
- Showtime, everybody!
- Is this necessary?

01:02:58.983 --> 01:03:01.318
Yes, it is. Let's go.

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:05.947
Quit bitching!
This is the part you do get paid for.

01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:08.492
Give us a couple of minutes?
Sure.

01:03:08.701 --> 01:03:12.662
How do you like our city?
- I love it! I love Miami!

01:03:13.414 --> 01:03:16.750
Take my love

01:03:16.918 --> 01:03:21.963
I'll never ask for too much

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:25.634
Just all that you are

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:30.806
And everything that you do

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:36.561
I don't really need to look
Very much further

01:03:36.729 --> 01:03:41.441
I don't wanna have to go
Where you don't follow

01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:45.654
I won't hold it back again
This passion inside

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:51.952
I can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide

01:03:52.119 --> 01:03:57.374
Your love I'll remember forever

01:03:57.959 --> 01:04:02.754
Don't make me close one more door

01:04:03.297 --> 01:04:07.092
I don't wanna hurt anymore

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:12.055
Stay in my arms if you dare

01:04:12.223 --> 01:04:16.893
Or must I imagine you there

01:04:17.061 --> 01:04:21.481
Don't walk away from me

01:04:22.149 --> 01:04:28.446
I have nothing, nothing, nothing

01:04:28.614 --> 01:04:35.871
Don't make me close one more door

01:04:36.205 --> 01:04:40.166
I don't wanna hurt anymore

01:04:40.459 --> 01:04:44.963
Stay in my arms if you dare

01:04:54.307 --> 01:04:56.057
Do you arrange all this?
- Mm-hm.

01:04:57.268 --> 01:04:59.227
Hey, that's me!

01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:13.783
Hello, Frank.

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:16.244
Portman.

01:05:16.537 --> 01:05:18.079
It's been a long time.

01:05:18.372 --> 01:05:19.497
You on the job?

01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:24.586
Technically, I'm off duty. But the governor
might show up here later, so I thought...

01:05:24.837 --> 01:05:26.796
...I'd give it a light check.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:29.674
Someone else is covering him now.

01:05:30.301 --> 01:05:31.718
How old's she?

01:05:32.011 --> 01:05:33.553
Maybe 18.

01:05:42.188 --> 01:05:43.396
Thank you.

01:05:43.689 --> 01:05:46.900
Thank you so much.
Listen, you're so right.

01:05:48.361 --> 01:05:50.403
I want you to have a good time...

01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:56.534
...and drink as much of Ben Schiller's
liquor as possible. Thank you.

01:05:58.329 --> 01:06:01.331
I'd call that a step up
from the president.

01:06:02.249 --> 01:06:04.084
Probably sings better too.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.588
- Handful.
- Oh, yeah.

01:06:09.882 --> 01:06:12.342
Lost track of you
after the Reagan thing.

01:06:13.761 --> 01:06:15.095
Yeah.

01:06:16.347 --> 01:06:17.931
Wasn't your fault, Frank.

01:06:18.766 --> 01:06:20.350
You weren't even there.

01:06:26.232 --> 01:06:27.857
I need a drink.

01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:33.321
Ew.

01:06:35.282 --> 01:06:37.158
It's orange juice.

01:06:38.035 --> 01:06:39.119
So who are you?

01:06:39.453 --> 01:06:40.620
Greg Portman.

01:06:41.706 --> 01:06:44.290
I take it you've met my bodyguard.

01:06:45.292 --> 01:06:47.419
We used to work together.

01:06:48.212 --> 01:06:49.254
Oh.

01:06:49.422 --> 01:06:51.047
Well, well, well...

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:53.591
What do you do now?

01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:55.135
Same thing as Farmer.

01:06:56.303 --> 01:06:58.179
Two samurai, huh?

01:07:01.475 --> 01:07:03.184
So are you working now?

01:07:04.478 --> 01:07:05.895
Not right now.

01:07:06.605 --> 01:07:07.897
Good.

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:11.735
Because I'm the only person
in this room that needs protection.

01:07:14.488 --> 01:07:17.282
Come on, let's go get a drink.
A real one.

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.217
Orange juice, sir?

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:46.019
I've been watching you all
night from across the room.

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:52.108
Why don't you go back there,
keep watching.

01:08:25.392 --> 01:08:26.850
No.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.522
No, I'm not doing this.

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:33.983
- I think you are.
- No.

01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:36.236
No!

01:08:37.404 --> 01:08:38.863
Please go now.

01:08:39.156 --> 01:08:40.865
Not right now.

01:08:41.033 --> 01:08:42.742
Tony.

01:08:43.077 --> 01:08:45.411
Mr. Portman was just leaving us.

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:53.419
Good night, Rachel.

01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:12.188
Shit.

01:10:09.955 --> 01:10:11.456
What are you looking at?

01:10:13.667 --> 01:10:17.629
Probably never had a heavy night
in your whole damn disciplined life.

01:10:18.297 --> 01:10:20.173
- Oh.
Coffee?

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:26.095
Farmer, you're
a self-righteous son of a bitch.

01:10:27.306 --> 01:10:29.724
And don't laugh at me.
Don't you dare judge me!

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:33.353
Give me a break. I didn't tell you
to fuck everybody in the hotel.

01:10:34.021 --> 01:10:36.648
Fuck this.
I don't need this shit.

01:10:42.947 --> 01:10:46.699
Industrial detergent
matches the traces in the glue.

01:10:46.867 --> 01:10:49.202
We're getting to him.
We're gonna nail this sucker.

01:10:49.828 --> 01:10:51.704
Don't take too long.

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:53.456
Frank.

01:10:53.624 --> 01:10:55.041
It's good money, isn't it?

01:10:57.294 --> 01:10:58.795
It's good money.

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:26.322
Rachel?

01:11:29.243 --> 01:11:31.369
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

01:11:31.578 --> 01:11:33.454
- Where's Tony?
- I don't know.

01:11:33.622 --> 01:11:35.540
I thought you were with her.

01:11:42.464 --> 01:11:46.009
Thuringer, this is Farmer.
Where's your man at the door?

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:49.012
The door to the suite.
Where is he?

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:52.348
Get someone up here now.

01:11:53.392 --> 01:11:54.517
He doesn't know.

01:11:54.768 --> 01:11:55.977
Where are you going?

01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:05.737
Hi, Bill.
Where have you been?

01:12:07.072 --> 01:12:09.240
I went to Bal Harbor, did a little shopping.

01:12:09.408 --> 01:12:13.036
Want these in the bedroom?
Leave them. I wanna look at them.

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:16.748
You had us worried.
You're not supposed to do that.

01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:20.501
I'll do what I want when I want.

01:12:20.753 --> 01:12:22.253
Besides...

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.381
...I'm tired
of hanging around deadbeats.

01:12:25.883 --> 01:12:27.300
No offense, Tony.

01:12:33.599 --> 01:12:35.308
One more time and I'm gone.

01:12:35.559 --> 01:12:38.436
You remember something:
You work here! You work for me!

01:12:38.604 --> 01:12:39.645
Rachel.

01:12:39.813 --> 01:12:43.316
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna check the route, as usual.

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:48.071
Did Fletcher call?

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:14.138
Gomez!

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.933
Luis Gomez?

01:13:28.028 --> 01:13:31.614
- What are you doing?
- It's none of your fucking business.

01:13:32.991 --> 01:13:34.200
Move it.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:37.078
Why don't you stick it up your ass!

01:13:53.303 --> 01:13:55.972
Don't hurt my husband. Please.
Don't hurt my husband.

01:13:56.223 --> 01:13:59.600
Please, don't hurt my husband.
He not up to nothing.

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:13.656
I'm sorry.

01:14:29.923 --> 01:14:32.133
- Hello.
Mommy?

01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:35.052
Fletcher, is that you?

01:14:35.262 --> 01:14:36.762
No.

01:14:37.181 --> 01:14:39.807
No.

01:14:41.602 --> 01:14:42.894
Frank.

01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:44.645
Listen.

01:14:45.272 --> 01:14:46.772
- I'm through, Bill.
- What?

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:49.442
I'll get you back to L.A., and that's it.

01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:52.195
The guy with Fletcher can cover you
till you get a replacement.

01:14:52.613 --> 01:14:54.780
She got a call
while you were downstairs.

01:14:55.032 --> 01:14:57.450
- I don't care.
- It was him. Same guy!

01:14:57.618 --> 01:15:00.369
- I said I don't care.
- Frank, it really shook her up!

01:15:00.537 --> 01:15:03.039
She thought it was Fletcher
calling from L.A.

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:05.082
I know she'll be reasonable now.

01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:07.710
- Come on.
- Save it, Devaney!

01:15:07.961 --> 01:15:11.881
The people who hire me, they don't have
to be convinced to save their own lives.

01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:17.678
Call me when she's ready to go down.

01:15:17.846 --> 01:15:19.430
Frank!

01:15:57.511 --> 01:16:00.429
Farmer, nothing that's happened
between us matters.

01:16:03.850 --> 01:16:05.476
I understand now.

01:16:08.021 --> 01:16:11.440
You'll have to believe me,
because I'm not gonna beg.

01:16:13.652 --> 01:16:15.820
It wasn't what he said...

01:16:16.863 --> 01:16:18.864
...it was the way he said it.

01:16:21.326 --> 01:16:24.203
Frank, I need you. I'm afraid.

01:16:26.123 --> 01:16:27.873
And I hate my fear.

01:16:30.502 --> 01:16:33.129
Please protect me. Protect Fletcher.

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:35.548
If anything happened to him, Frank...

01:16:36.049 --> 01:16:37.508
I can't.

01:16:38.552 --> 01:16:42.513
I can't...
I can't protect you like this.

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:47.059
It's impossible.
The odds are all on his side.

01:16:48.895 --> 01:16:51.564
I will do whatever you say.

01:17:00.657 --> 01:17:04.035
I'd want to take you
away from here for a while.

01:17:04.494 --> 01:17:05.911
All right, I can do that.

01:17:11.752 --> 01:17:14.420
It'd mean canceling
the rest of your concert dates.

01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:20.051
All right.

01:17:21.011 --> 01:17:22.845
No more Sy.

01:17:26.183 --> 01:17:28.309
Give Devaney and Tony a vacation.

01:17:31.897 --> 01:17:34.398
Okay. All right.

01:17:34.566 --> 01:17:38.110
You cross me up this time,
I swear I'll kill you myself.

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:40.464
Lake's a little low.

01:18:41.258 --> 01:18:43.259
It'll rise when it thaws.

01:18:51.685 --> 01:18:53.519
Are they all in trouble?

01:18:55.897 --> 01:18:57.148
Just one.

01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:06.031
He likes you, Fletcher.

01:19:06.658 --> 01:19:11.704
- So is that gonna protect us?
- Yeah, he's a trained noisemaker.

01:19:11.997 --> 01:19:15.166
- Come here, Foster.
- Terrific. Just what we need.

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:19.295
Well, I don't like big dogs.
They don't know who they're eating.

01:19:19.796 --> 01:19:21.338
And this one does?

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.257
Yeah, this one does.

01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:37.688
Excuse me.

01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:41.525
Katherine had this place
organized the way she liked.

01:19:42.402 --> 01:19:44.028
That's Frank's mama.

01:19:51.912 --> 01:19:54.246
Fletcher can't swim very well.

01:19:54.748 --> 01:19:56.999
He better stay in the boat, then.

01:20:02.297 --> 01:20:03.547
Try it again. Try it.

01:20:03.715 --> 01:20:04.924
You wanna pull again?

01:20:11.389 --> 01:20:14.558
- Frank tells me you're a singer.
- Yeah, that's right.

01:20:14.726 --> 01:20:16.685
Yeah, well...

01:20:16.853 --> 01:20:20.022
...we're kind of out of things up here.
I'm sorry.

01:20:20.357 --> 01:20:21.774
That's okay.

01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:26.946
You must be very successful
if you need someone like Frank.

01:20:30.283 --> 01:20:31.784
It's quiet here.

01:20:32.786 --> 01:20:36.288
Frank spent six months up here
after that Reagan thing.

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.374
Reagan thing?

01:20:39.584 --> 01:20:44.088
Frank wasn't there the day Reagan
was shot. He's never gotten over it.

01:20:46.258 --> 01:20:47.424
That's...

01:20:49.469 --> 01:20:51.804
...the day we buried Katherine.

01:20:56.059 --> 01:20:58.227
NICKl: He's a real rascal now.
Tell us.

01:20:59.729 --> 01:21:02.147
I never hit him ever.
- You should have.

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.984
That's unusual for my people.

01:21:05.318 --> 01:21:07.903
So, what happens, he's 10 years old...

01:21:08.154 --> 01:21:11.991
...and he comes to me and
starts complaining. How about that?

01:21:12.617 --> 01:21:15.578
I'll tell them about the time
you stripped in court.

01:21:15.829 --> 01:21:17.621
NICKl:
I wanna hear that story.

01:21:18.582 --> 01:21:21.041
I don't mind. I'm proud of that!

01:21:22.294 --> 01:21:25.963
Anyway, he starts playing
tackle football when he's 10 years old...

01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:30.342
...and one day he says to me
and he says he's afraid of being hit.

01:21:30.635 --> 01:21:34.430
Says it's my fault. "How come
you never hit me?" he says to me.

01:21:34.681 --> 01:21:36.348
How about that, huh?

01:21:36.850 --> 01:21:40.686
He got over it, turned into
one hell of a wide receiver.

01:21:42.105 --> 01:21:45.441
He was always like that, my son.
Couldn't stand being afraid.

01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:50.654
Something scared him, he'd keep
doing it until the fear went away.

01:21:51.948 --> 01:21:54.283
His mama was the same way.

01:21:54.659 --> 01:21:56.160
NICKl:
You have a beautiful family.

01:21:56.494 --> 01:21:59.079
Had enough to eat?
Wipe your mouth.

01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:00.789
Save some for dessert.

01:22:00.957 --> 01:22:02.041
You through?

01:22:02.292 --> 01:22:07.713
I won't tell them about the time you were 13,
when you first found out about girls.

01:22:12.677 --> 01:22:15.721
Come on, Frank.
You can run but you can't hide.

01:22:18.850 --> 01:22:20.309
All right.

01:22:20.977 --> 01:22:22.394
So I'm black, right?

01:22:22.562 --> 01:22:25.356
Don't touch that. You know you're white.
Your move.

01:22:25.607 --> 01:22:27.733
It's my move? You're sure?

01:22:27.901 --> 01:22:31.362
The last move, I took your rook
with my bishop. Right there.

01:22:36.868 --> 01:22:38.160
That's right.

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:46.168
How long has this been going on?

01:22:49.089 --> 01:22:50.130
Three years.

01:22:51.508 --> 01:22:54.134
First year he had me on the run.

01:22:58.431 --> 01:23:00.265
What do you think?

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:02.893
Knight to king-4.

01:23:03.728 --> 01:23:04.937
City kid.

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:24.248
Son, you come here and sit with me.

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:32.881
That's it for me, guys. I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

01:23:33.299 --> 01:23:34.925
You're in trouble.

01:23:35.093 --> 01:23:36.176
Yeah.

01:23:47.105 --> 01:23:49.732
Foster, right here.
Turn around.

01:23:50.191 --> 01:23:51.275
Good.

01:24:06.499 --> 01:24:08.000
Good night, Rachel.

01:24:09.002 --> 01:24:10.502
Good night, Frank.

01:24:10.962 --> 01:24:12.504
Good night, Foster.

01:24:15.842 --> 01:24:17.801
It's good to hear you laugh.

01:24:23.016 --> 01:24:24.308
Stay.

01:24:45.497 --> 01:24:47.539
NICKl:
You're very thorough.

01:24:55.632 --> 01:24:57.883
What's happening
with you and Rachel?

01:24:59.886 --> 01:25:03.305
One minute she has magnetic hands,
the next she hates you.

01:25:03.556 --> 01:25:05.808
I don't know what's going on now.

01:25:06.142 --> 01:25:08.519
You follow all her moves this closely?

01:25:11.356 --> 01:25:13.065
It's a living.

01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:15.317
No, it's not.

01:25:22.408 --> 01:25:25.327
You must think my life's pretty sickly,
don't you?

01:25:26.287 --> 01:25:28.413
- No.
- You must.

01:25:28.706 --> 01:25:29.915
I do.

01:25:30.875 --> 01:25:32.918
Then why don't you change it?

01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:39.299
Is it that easy?

01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:55.315
You're a lovely woman.

01:25:56.192 --> 01:25:58.318
But you don't want me?

01:26:01.573 --> 01:26:04.241
I'm surprised.
Thorough fellow like you.

01:26:04.450 --> 01:26:07.828
Why stop at one sister
when you could've fuck them both?

01:26:09.455 --> 01:26:11.331
I make my mistakes.

01:26:11.875 --> 01:26:14.251
But you didn't say no to the boss.

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:28.765
Is this elk?

01:26:29.309 --> 01:26:31.018
No.

01:26:33.479 --> 01:26:35.397
- A deer?
- Yup.

01:26:35.565 --> 01:26:36.899
It's big.

01:26:37.066 --> 01:26:39.109
NICKl
... loves me

01:26:39.277 --> 01:26:44.615
Yes, Jesus loves me

01:26:46.492 --> 01:26:50.287
First time I've heard church music
in the middle of the week.

01:26:52.081 --> 01:26:58.629
For the Bible tells me so

01:27:01.841 --> 01:27:05.802
Jesus loves me

01:27:05.970 --> 01:27:09.932
Oh, yes, he does

01:27:10.808 --> 01:27:14.645
Jesus loves me

01:27:14.812 --> 01:27:20.067
Oh, yes, he does

01:27:20.526 --> 01:27:24.238
Jesus loves me

01:27:24.405 --> 01:27:28.200
Oh, yes, he does

01:27:28.368 --> 01:27:38.001
For the Bible tells me so

01:27:39.712 --> 01:27:41.797
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey, honey.

01:27:59.565 --> 01:28:01.066
Where's Fletcher?

01:28:05.738 --> 01:28:08.240
- Fletcher!
Fletcher!

01:28:12.495 --> 01:28:13.537
Fletcher!

01:28:16.749 --> 01:28:18.583
Fletcher, no!

01:28:22.714 --> 01:28:23.880
Fletcher!

01:28:24.090 --> 01:28:25.757
Fletcher!

01:28:33.182 --> 01:28:34.349
Help!

01:28:34.517 --> 01:28:35.600
He can't swim!

01:28:39.605 --> 01:28:40.689
Fletcher!

01:28:45.737 --> 01:28:47.070
Help!

01:28:47.363 --> 01:28:49.906
Fletcher!
- Help.

01:28:51.034 --> 01:28:52.534
Let me have him!

01:28:53.703 --> 01:28:55.162
Fletcher!

01:28:56.748 --> 01:28:58.623
Fletcher.

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:01.043
Frank. Here, Frank.

01:29:04.464 --> 01:29:06.048
What were you doing?

01:29:07.383 --> 01:29:10.135
Frank, you're crazy!
You are out of your mind!

01:29:11.429 --> 01:29:14.264
You could have drowned him!
You could have drowned him!

01:29:14.557 --> 01:29:16.016
I'm sorry.

01:29:17.643 --> 01:29:18.727
I got careless.

01:29:22.315 --> 01:29:24.274
How will we get the boat?

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:36.036
Put them in there. It doesn't matter.

01:29:36.245 --> 01:29:38.497
Okay, this thermometer.

01:29:45.963 --> 01:29:50.342
Someone's cut the phone lines.
Could be anywhere from here to town.

01:29:50.635 --> 01:29:53.428
Both cars are dead
and I can't see how it was done.

01:29:53.638 --> 01:29:55.013
Henry.

01:29:55.181 --> 01:29:57.307
Who knows you're here?

01:29:57.683 --> 01:30:00.352
Don't know.
This place has nothing to do with her.

01:30:01.145 --> 01:30:03.313
Maybe it has to do with you.

01:30:05.274 --> 01:30:08.985
- We can't walk out of here at night with them.
- I know.

01:30:09.654 --> 01:30:12.697
Let's button down tonight
and walk out at first light.

01:31:31.110 --> 01:31:33.278
I was an idiot last night.

01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:41.286
What'd you think about today?

01:31:48.294 --> 01:31:50.670
I think this is no maniac.

01:31:52.381 --> 01:31:53.965
He knows what he's doing.

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:57.302
You're right. He does.

01:32:01.140 --> 01:32:02.432
Tell me about him.

01:32:03.809 --> 01:32:06.102
- Who is it, Nicki?
- He almost got Fletcher.

01:32:06.270 --> 01:32:07.479
How do we stop him?

01:32:07.730 --> 01:32:10.315
- He almost got the baby!
- Who is it?

01:32:10.566 --> 01:32:11.942
I don't know.

01:32:12.193 --> 01:32:16.696
- Call it off.
- He doesn't even know who hired him.

01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:20.951
I don't know who he is.
He doesn't know who I am.

01:32:21.827 --> 01:32:23.703
How did you do it?

01:32:24.539 --> 01:32:25.622
- I went to...
- How?

01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:28.333
I went to a bar in East L.A.

01:32:30.336 --> 01:32:33.004
I asked around,
and there was this guy...

01:32:33.297 --> 01:32:34.506
Name?

01:32:34.757 --> 01:32:36.299
- Give me a name!
- Armando.

01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:38.510
Armando.

01:32:43.766 --> 01:32:45.976
He arranged it. That's all I know.

01:32:47.228 --> 01:32:48.270
It's all paid for?

01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:56.361
- Is it all paid for?
- And then some, okay? Till it's done.

01:32:58.739 --> 01:33:02.158
- He keeps going until he kills her?
- Yeah.

01:33:03.744 --> 01:33:04.828
Yes.

01:33:04.996 --> 01:33:10.625
- What's the name of the bar?
- I'm not sure. I was very stoned.

01:33:12.837 --> 01:33:15.630
All right. How about the letters?

01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:19.968
The letters came first.
I don't know who's writing them.

01:33:20.219 --> 01:33:22.887
Shit, but they're reading my mind.

01:33:23.139 --> 01:33:26.391
Those are my thoughts. I hate her.

01:33:30.062 --> 01:33:32.522
It made me think I could do it.

01:33:33.524 --> 01:33:38.653
But I would never hurt the baby.
I would never hurt Fletcher!

01:33:41.282 --> 01:33:44.200
- You must stop it.
- We will.

01:33:44.410 --> 01:33:45.827
We will, you and me.

01:33:48.497 --> 01:33:49.873
Okay.

01:33:53.753 --> 01:33:56.838
Frank, don't you even want to know why?

01:33:57.757 --> 01:34:00.759
You told me. She has everything.

01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:09.434
- What if we can't find this guy?
- Shh. Shh.

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:16.524
Stay here and don't move.

01:34:32.958 --> 01:34:34.292
- It's me.
- God...

01:34:35.378 --> 01:34:36.711
What's happening?

01:34:37.129 --> 01:34:38.588
Stay with Rachel!

01:34:38.756 --> 01:34:41.800
Where's Nicki?
- No, stop! I'm the one who paid you.

01:34:58.526 --> 01:35:00.985
Dad?
- We're all right.

01:36:19.190 --> 01:36:21.065
- Doesn't make sense.
What do you mean?

01:36:21.317 --> 01:36:22.358
We got him.

01:36:23.068 --> 01:36:26.404
- What do you mean? Where?
- Here, last night in L.A.

01:36:26.655 --> 01:36:30.074
You should see this guy's locker.
He's obsessed with her.

01:36:30.659 --> 01:36:34.078
- You sure it's him?
- Forensics say a 100 percent positive ID.

01:36:34.705 --> 01:36:37.040
And he's got a black Toyota 4 x 4.

01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:38.458
We know you did it.

01:36:39.168 --> 01:36:40.585
Ray's with him now.

01:36:41.754 --> 01:36:46.257
You sent her the letters.
We don't need you to admit it.

01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:47.884
- We know.
- No.

01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:49.594
- We know it.
- No.

01:36:49.887 --> 01:36:54.891
Whoever you got wasn't here last night.
This was a professional.

01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:58.436
This is crazy.
What do you want to do?

01:37:00.272 --> 01:37:01.606
How long can you keep him?

01:37:02.441 --> 01:37:07.278
All he's done is write some letters.
Forty-eight hours. You know the deal.

01:37:09.615 --> 01:37:10.907
I know.

01:37:17.289 --> 01:37:22.252
Stringent security
surrounded the funeral of Nicki Marron...

01:37:22.503 --> 01:37:26.130
...who was gunned down at a lakeside
retreat by an unknown intruder.

01:37:26.423 --> 01:37:29.300
Nicki was the eldest sister
of Rachel Marron.

01:37:29.552 --> 01:37:33.888
A spokesman for the Oscar-nominated
actress said she was devastated...

01:37:34.139 --> 01:37:38.309
...and that it cast a pall over
the upcoming Academy Award ceremony.

01:37:38.519 --> 01:37:42.021
It's not known whether Miss Marron
will now be attending the Oscars.

01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:44.691
Police at the sight
of the killings say they...

01:38:54.011 --> 01:38:55.219
You okay, Frank?

01:38:56.889 --> 01:39:00.475
Yeah, Fletcher, I'm okay.
How about yourself?

01:39:02.394 --> 01:39:04.020
I couldn't sleep.

01:39:06.231 --> 01:39:09.192
It was so scary,
just thinking about it.

01:39:11.236 --> 01:39:13.196
You feel scared, Frank?

01:39:14.031 --> 01:39:16.240
Everybody's afraid of something.

01:39:18.243 --> 01:39:23.373
That's how we know we care about
things, when we're afraid to lose them.

01:39:25.542 --> 01:39:27.001
What are you afraid of?

01:39:29.755 --> 01:39:32.507
I think you should try to go back to sleep.

01:39:35.844 --> 01:39:37.887
Is it the man who killed Nicki?

01:39:40.265 --> 01:39:42.100
Are you afraid of him?

01:39:43.394 --> 01:39:44.769
No.

01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:46.562
Then what?

01:39:48.107 --> 01:39:50.274
What are you afraid of?

01:39:54.071 --> 01:39:55.321
I'm af...

01:39:56.782 --> 01:39:58.783
I'm afraid of not...

01:40:00.244 --> 01:40:01.619
...being there.

01:40:08.043 --> 01:40:11.421
It's late. Want me to take you
up to your room?

01:40:12.297 --> 01:40:14.132
No.

01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:08.770
Do you mind if I sit down?

01:41:09.688 --> 01:41:11.272
No.

01:41:21.533 --> 01:41:23.159
It isn't over yet, is it?

01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:28.372
So he'll come again?

01:41:29.708 --> 01:41:31.167
It's possible.

01:41:32.503 --> 01:41:33.961
At the Oscars?

01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:36.631
Maybe.

01:41:41.303 --> 01:41:44.138
You know, when I was back
in Squirrel Hill...

01:41:44.306 --> 01:41:48.893
...I started betting my friends 50 bucks
each that someday I'd win an Oscar.

01:41:51.063 --> 01:41:54.690
It's very important for them
to see me up there if I win.

01:41:56.401 --> 01:42:00.655
And if every one of those pikers comes
through, it could add up to a lot of money.

01:42:06.411 --> 01:42:08.371
I don't know, Rachel.

01:42:08.705 --> 01:42:10.790
I think it's still dangerous.

01:42:11.041 --> 01:42:14.252
I didn't get to this place in my life
by doing the smart thing every time.

01:42:18.090 --> 01:42:19.173
How about you?

01:42:20.134 --> 01:42:23.928
Frank Farmer.
Out there on the edge.

01:42:24.263 --> 01:42:27.431
Have you done something in your life
that didn't make sense?

01:42:29.893 --> 01:42:32.270
Except somewhere inside you,
in your stomach somewhere?

01:42:36.275 --> 01:42:37.775
I know you have.

01:42:38.318 --> 01:42:40.945
Because no one gets good without it.

01:42:41.613 --> 01:42:43.030
And I know you're good.

01:42:48.954 --> 01:42:50.246
Look...

01:42:51.081 --> 01:42:53.457
...I don't know why
this is happening...

01:42:55.335 --> 01:42:57.920
...but I know it's not your fault.

01:42:58.422 --> 01:43:02.258
I hope you hear me,
because this is the way I say I'm sorry.

01:43:04.136 --> 01:43:05.428
So...

01:43:06.597 --> 01:43:08.890
...I'm going to the Oscars
and see if I win.

01:43:10.058 --> 01:43:12.852
And I won't worry about it
at all, because...

01:43:13.812 --> 01:43:16.606
...I have you to protect me, right?

01:43:17.482 --> 01:43:19.066
That's right.

01:43:23.864 --> 01:43:25.156
That's right.

01:43:47.804 --> 01:43:49.722
Jason. Jason Bogart, ladies and gentlemen.

01:44:03.987 --> 01:44:07.698
A- limos
14, 27, 29, move up to arrivals area.

01:44:09.201 --> 01:44:12.954
We'll go straight to the green room,
right, Frank? Got that, Tony?

01:44:13.121 --> 01:44:14.664
Tony knows what he's doing.

01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:19.502
I wish you guys would relax.
Nothing bad's going to happen.

01:44:20.045 --> 01:44:21.462
Right?

01:44:22.172 --> 01:44:23.881
Unless I lose the fucking award.

01:44:27.344 --> 01:44:28.678
Jesus. What a crew.

01:44:32.391 --> 01:44:35.643
Screw it.
I'm tired of worrying about it.

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:37.645
When your time is up...

01:44:38.730 --> 01:44:40.064
...it's up.

01:44:41.066 --> 01:44:42.441
Right, Frank?

01:44:47.572 --> 01:44:49.949
This could be it. Who's that?

01:44:50.242 --> 01:44:52.618
Let's see, that looks like...

01:44:52.869 --> 01:44:55.913
...one of our big Best Actress
Academy Award nominees...

01:44:56.081 --> 01:44:59.333
Yes! That's Rachel!
Rachel Marron!

01:45:03.213 --> 01:45:06.590
Rachel! Rachel!
Rachel Marron, ladies and gentlemen.

01:45:06.758 --> 01:45:08.676
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

01:45:08.844 --> 01:45:10.428
Very good. You look lovely.

01:45:10.679 --> 01:45:12.513
- Thank you.
- They love you.

01:45:12.681 --> 01:45:14.390
- They're going wild!
- Isn't that great?

01:45:14.558 --> 01:45:16.726
How about being the queen of this night?

01:45:16.977 --> 01:45:19.270
Let's hope I'm the queen of this night.

01:45:19.563 --> 01:45:21.397
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:45:21.565 --> 01:45:22.982
Rachel Marron, everybody.

01:45:29.281 --> 01:45:32.992
And the award for
Best Achievement in Sound...

01:45:33.869 --> 01:45:36.912
...goes to Kay Colvin...

01:45:37.247 --> 01:45:40.624
...and Mychal Smith for Hot and Cold.

01:46:01.396 --> 01:46:03.314
Thank you so much.

01:46:03.815 --> 01:46:05.983
I want to thank our producers.

01:46:09.112 --> 01:46:12.615
There is a gap, house left, rows EE, FF.
Get fillers.

01:46:14.576 --> 01:46:18.788
Hi, Rachel. I just need to fill you in
on some of your responsibilities.

01:46:19.039 --> 01:46:20.331
All right.
Okay.

01:46:20.499 --> 01:46:23.626
Right now, it's Best Sound.
Then another song, then you.

01:46:23.877 --> 01:46:27.171
At 8:07, you will be presenting
with Clive Healy.

01:46:28.048 --> 01:46:29.298
These are your lines.

01:46:29.466 --> 01:46:32.843
The TelePrompTer is straight ahead
and, we pray, working perfectly.

01:46:33.011 --> 01:46:34.845
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:39.308
Rachel, I understand it's my honor
to escort you on stage.

01:46:39.559 --> 01:46:43.312
That's right, and I don't like it one bit
that you look skinnier than me.

01:46:43.563 --> 01:46:44.855
I wish.

01:46:45.690 --> 01:46:48.025
How's the Hollywood
cricket team doing?

01:46:48.276 --> 01:46:51.195
Coming out of commercial.

01:46:51.363 --> 01:46:53.155
Five, four, three, two.
Cue music.

01:46:54.533 --> 01:46:56.200
And cue Robert.

01:46:58.286 --> 01:47:00.204
And enter Robert's monologue.

01:47:01.206 --> 01:47:02.498
Stand by, dancers.

01:47:02.707 --> 01:47:05.793
I heard that the New York economy
is so bad...

01:47:06.044 --> 01:47:09.296
...that the Mafia has
laid off five judges.

01:47:09.714 --> 01:47:11.715
Tony.

01:47:12.384 --> 01:47:14.593
I'm going to look around,
then come back for her.

01:47:14.761 --> 01:47:16.929
- Okay.
- Hey.

01:47:17.097 --> 01:47:18.722
No more carrots.

01:47:19.391 --> 01:47:21.142
The couple that won Best Sound...

01:47:21.309 --> 01:47:25.020
...did you ever see a woman who worked
on sound that looked like that?

01:47:25.188 --> 01:47:27.356
She must have been the boom girl.

01:47:27.983 --> 01:47:30.526
Looked like the
bada-bing-bada-boom girl.

01:47:30.694 --> 01:47:32.736
If she's working sound,
who's listening?

01:47:33.029 --> 01:47:35.156
Thirty seconds to lighting change.

01:47:35.365 --> 01:47:38.492
He was eloquent:
"This is the most happiest day of my life. "

01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:41.704
His mother must have been very most
proudest of him at that moment.

01:47:41.872 --> 01:47:45.875
Twenty seconds.
Twenty seconds.

01:47:46.042 --> 01:47:48.586
- Portman.
- Hey, Frank. How are you doing?

01:47:48.837 --> 01:47:50.629
What are you doing here?

01:47:50.839 --> 01:47:52.590
- On the job.
- Who?

01:47:52.841 --> 01:47:54.341
Standby.

01:47:54.509 --> 01:47:55.759
Him.

01:47:56.219 --> 01:47:57.511
Short-term gig...

01:47:58.430 --> 01:48:00.181
...but profitable.

01:48:00.724 --> 01:48:02.558
Ten seconds.

01:48:02.726 --> 01:48:05.102
Listen, Frank, I'm sorry about Miami.

01:48:05.729 --> 01:48:08.898
Three, two. Cue music.

01:48:10.650 --> 01:48:11.775
And cue dancers.

01:48:15.655 --> 01:48:20.117
Don't make me close one more door

01:48:20.285 --> 01:48:23.078
Back to work.
See you at the Governor's Ball.

01:48:23.246 --> 01:48:25.414
I don't wanna hurt anymore

01:48:25.582 --> 01:48:29.376
Stay in my arms if you dare

01:48:29.544 --> 01:48:33.464
Must I imagine you there

01:48:33.632 --> 01:48:35.591
Don't walk away from me

01:48:35.759 --> 01:48:37.968
Not a bad voice.
Sounds great.

01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:40.638
Now, I want that broad
run out of town.

01:48:40.805 --> 01:48:41.972
She's got to go!

01:48:43.934 --> 01:48:45.392
Tony, you there?

01:48:46.144 --> 01:48:48.437
- Tony, you there?
- Yeah, Frank.

01:48:48.688 --> 01:48:53.150
Tony, I have a feeling this is the night.
I think he'll go for her on camera.

01:48:53.401 --> 01:48:54.485
That's crazy!

01:48:54.778 --> 01:48:58.614
That's how he wants it to look,
except he isn't crazy. He's very clever.

01:48:58.782 --> 01:49:01.075
- Listen. I need you to help me tonight.
- Excuse me.

01:49:01.243 --> 01:49:05.079
You can't use that back here. The
breakthrough is killing our radio mikes.

01:49:05.247 --> 01:49:07.790
I'm going to have to disconnect you.
I'm sorry.

01:49:07.999 --> 01:49:09.166
I said I'll do it.

01:49:09.543 --> 01:49:10.626
Frank.

01:49:10.961 --> 01:49:13.295
You get it back after the show.
I'm sorry.

01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:25.015
Rachel. Live.

01:49:25.183 --> 01:49:27.685
- What's wrong?
We're ready to go, okay?

01:49:28.144 --> 01:49:30.187
- Frank.
Rachel, shall we go?

01:49:30.522 --> 01:49:35.734
Excuse me, is this necessary?
We have our own man at the door!

01:49:36.027 --> 01:49:37.278
Rachel, please.

01:49:38.029 --> 01:49:39.947
No. I want him.

01:49:43.118 --> 01:49:44.326
Fine.

01:49:46.496 --> 01:49:48.289
Stay alert.

01:49:49.874 --> 01:49:52.209
Let us brighten this firmament.

01:49:57.382 --> 01:50:00.301
You, you, you, you

01:50:00.468 --> 01:50:04.847
You

01:50:09.311 --> 01:50:12.980
Coming through, please.
How much time do we have?

01:50:13.398 --> 01:50:16.025
Resetting staircases.
Resetting staircases.

01:50:16.192 --> 01:50:18.027
Scenery coming in. Heads up, guys.

01:50:18.194 --> 01:50:19.695
Thirty seconds to lighting change.

01:50:19.863 --> 01:50:22.031
Thirty seconds to lighting change.

01:50:25.118 --> 01:50:28.454
Thirty seconds. Don't panic.
Clear this area, please.

01:50:29.831 --> 01:50:32.082
Standby caption super.

01:50:33.043 --> 01:50:34.585
Okay, Rachel.

01:50:34.753 --> 01:50:37.087
Up the steps, to the right and through.

01:50:37.339 --> 01:50:40.924
Clive, up, to the left and through.
You'll meet on the landing.

01:50:41.092 --> 01:50:42.843
Fifteen seconds.

01:50:43.011 --> 01:50:45.721
Watch your step.
Somebody spilled water.

01:50:47.891 --> 01:50:49.391
Rachel?

01:50:49.851 --> 01:50:51.101
Shall we?

01:50:59.444 --> 01:51:01.987
Try to relax, Rachel.
You must be very excited.

01:51:03.114 --> 01:51:04.448
Thank you.

01:51:09.079 --> 01:51:11.372
Presenting the award for Best Song...

01:51:11.623 --> 01:51:15.459
...Hollywood's newest royal couple.
England's knight in shining armor...

01:51:15.752 --> 01:51:18.545
...and America's queen of the night.

01:51:18.797 --> 01:51:22.383
Please welcome
Clive Healy and Rachel Marron.

01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:51.829
Well, Rachel.

01:51:51.996 --> 01:51:56.375
I know you only came to present.
You'll want to leave when we're done.

01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:09.638
No, Clive, I'm very interested
in one of the awards tonight.

01:52:10.306 --> 01:52:11.890
Best Actor.

01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:19.857
We've heard five smashing songs and the
names of the artists who created them.

01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:30.367
And, no matter what anyone thinks,
I know you have no personal favorites.

01:52:31.244 --> 01:52:33.036
The Best Song nominees are:

01:52:33.371 --> 01:52:38.167
"Clock on the Wall" from A Dining Room
Table by Dana S. Lee and Sarah Spring.

01:52:42.088 --> 01:52:46.091
"Give Me Your Trust" from Out of the Gloom
by David Siegel and Barbara Gordon.

01:52:51.055 --> 01:52:55.392
"I Have Nothing" from Queen of the Night
by Nancy Garber.

01:52:58.605 --> 01:53:03.066
And "Reflections of My Heart"
from Hot and Cold by Leslie Moraes.

01:53:08.364 --> 01:53:09.782
All right, Clive.

01:53:09.991 --> 01:53:11.074
Let's find out...

01:53:13.161 --> 01:53:14.411
...who the winner is.

01:53:14.746 --> 01:53:17.623
The envelope.
Shall I do the honors?

01:53:29.093 --> 01:53:31.011
And the winner is:
"I Have Nothing"...

01:53:31.262 --> 01:53:33.472
...from Queen of the Night
by Nancy Garber.

01:53:40.605 --> 01:53:42.314
She's good.
No, she's good, Frank.

01:53:46.110 --> 01:53:47.861
I'm okay. I'm fine!

01:53:48.029 --> 01:53:49.613
I always said she was nuts.

01:53:49.823 --> 01:53:51.406
- I'm okay, all right?
- You sure?

01:53:51.658 --> 01:53:54.034
Farmer! You made me a raving lunatic!

01:53:54.244 --> 01:53:56.119
- Jesus.
Fifteen seconds.

01:53:56.287 --> 01:53:58.705
- For God's sake.
- Yeah, okay. I got you.

01:53:58.873 --> 01:54:00.541
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

01:54:00.708 --> 01:54:02.084
- Great.
She'll be good.

01:54:02.252 --> 01:54:03.710
Fucking actresses!

01:54:05.338 --> 01:54:06.922
- Where's Portman?
- Who?

01:54:07.090 --> 01:54:09.174
- Portman.
- Never heard of him.

01:54:15.723 --> 01:54:20.143
Rachel, if you want to be in your seat
for Best Actress, you have to go now.

01:54:20.353 --> 01:54:24.314
I'm moving as fast as I can.
Why don't you go twitch somewhere else?

01:54:24.566 --> 01:54:26.984
Everything's fine. No one noticed.

01:54:27.151 --> 01:54:29.611
Everyone's jumping out of their skins
with nerves.

01:54:29.779 --> 01:54:33.490
- Bullshit! He's making me into a lunatic!
- Something's going on...

01:54:33.658 --> 01:54:36.243
- ... you should know about.
- You're driving her crazy!

01:54:36.411 --> 01:54:37.619
Rachel, I know who it is.

01:54:37.787 --> 01:54:40.122
- You're driving us all crazy.
- Shut up! Shut up!

01:54:40.290 --> 01:54:42.416
You're a maniac!
You've embarrassed me...

01:54:42.584 --> 01:54:45.252
...in front of billions of people.
You won't quit!

01:54:46.337 --> 01:54:49.256
Rachel, wait for Frank.
Honey, please.

01:54:49.424 --> 01:54:51.466
- Three minutes...
- You calm the fuck down!

01:54:51.718 --> 01:54:53.302
Is he coming or not?

01:54:57.348 --> 01:54:59.141
Tony. I know who it is.

01:54:59.309 --> 01:55:00.350
- Who?
- It's Portman.

01:55:00.518 --> 01:55:02.185
- Who?
- Remember?

01:55:02.437 --> 01:55:04.146
The guy in Miami.

01:55:04.355 --> 01:55:06.440
- Yeah, pencil neck!
- Is anybody coming with me?

01:55:06.608 --> 01:55:07.691
Him? What are you...?

01:55:07.859 --> 01:55:09.359
After tonight, you're in charge.

01:55:09.527 --> 01:55:11.737
This guy knows nothing
about show business.

01:55:11.988 --> 01:55:14.156
Two minutes to Best Actress.

01:55:15.533 --> 01:55:17.242
You're an asshole.

01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:20.871
To present the Best Actress award...

01:55:21.122 --> 01:55:23.707
...we have the man who won last year...

01:55:23.958 --> 01:55:27.127
...for his performance
in South of Waco.

01:55:27.378 --> 01:55:29.379
Please welcome Mr. Tom Winston.

01:55:40.808 --> 01:55:42.059
Thank you, Academy.

01:55:42.226 --> 01:55:43.644
- Tony.
- Yeah, did you see him?

01:55:43.811 --> 01:55:44.853
No.

01:55:45.063 --> 01:55:48.565
- I need you on the other side of the stage.
- What do I do?

01:55:49.567 --> 01:55:52.527
See those people?
They don't need to be there.

01:55:52.779 --> 01:55:54.696
That camera guy
doesn't need to be there.

01:55:54.906 --> 01:55:57.074
I'll take care of it.

01:56:00.703 --> 01:56:02.746
Rachel Marron
for Queen of the Night.

01:56:07.919 --> 01:56:09.795
Tony! Tony!

01:56:14.133 --> 01:56:17.886
What are you doing there?
The winner is:

01:56:20.056 --> 01:56:22.224
Rachel Marron...

01:56:22.433 --> 01:56:24.309
...Queen of the Night.

01:57:41.429 --> 01:57:44.347
Go to commercial! He's got a gun!

01:57:50.146 --> 01:57:51.855
Frank, what are you doing?!

01:57:52.023 --> 01:57:53.065
Portman!

01:57:54.484 --> 01:57:55.567
Portman!

01:57:56.861 --> 01:57:58.111
Portman!

01:58:11.459 --> 01:58:14.419
Oh, my God!
What's going on?

01:58:14.587 --> 01:58:15.712
She's bleeding!

01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:18.632
It's not me! It's not me!

01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:20.383
He's my bodyguard!

01:58:20.551 --> 01:58:23.053
Frank! Frank.

01:58:29.268 --> 01:58:31.645
No, no! Frank!

01:58:31.813 --> 01:58:34.523
Frank! Stay with me, Frank!
Stay with me.

01:58:34.732 --> 01:58:36.233
Come on, Frank, come on.

01:58:36.943 --> 01:58:39.194
God! Hurry up!

01:58:40.071 --> 01:58:43.240
Come on, Frank!
Stay with me! Stay with me.

01:59:48.931 --> 01:59:50.807
Hey!

01:59:56.272 --> 01:59:57.647
How's it going?

01:59:58.149 --> 01:59:59.524
It's under control.

02:00:00.651 --> 02:00:03.028
- Won't be the same without you.
- Hi, Frank!

02:00:04.322 --> 02:00:05.614
How you doing, Fletch?

02:00:20.004 --> 02:00:21.838
You shouldn't be here.

02:00:24.133 --> 02:00:27.177
- So you're quitting show business, huh?
- Yeah.

02:00:27.345 --> 02:00:29.679
Too bad. You had talent.

02:00:34.185 --> 02:00:36.603
Fletcher, go to the plane. Go.

02:00:40.358 --> 02:00:41.691
So how's the new guy?

02:00:44.111 --> 02:00:45.862
He's got white hair, Frank.

02:00:48.157 --> 02:00:49.199
He's very good.

02:00:49.367 --> 02:00:52.035
Yeah, but did you have to
get me an old man?

02:00:52.787 --> 02:00:54.371
I don't trust you.

02:01:08.010 --> 02:01:11.388
Let's get this over with, okay?
Give me a kiss.

02:01:18.104 --> 02:01:19.312
Goodbye, Rachel.

02:01:21.065 --> 02:01:22.524
Bye, Frank.

02:01:51.429 --> 02:01:55.098
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

02:02:11.198 --> 02:02:12.282
Wait!

02:02:38.601 --> 02:02:40.477
You

02:02:41.645 --> 02:02:43.772
My darling you

02:02:48.444 --> 02:02:54.199
Bittersweet memories

02:02:55.743 --> 02:03:02.707
That is all I'm taking with me

02:03:02.875 --> 02:03:05.418
So goodbye

02:03:06.087 --> 02:03:08.963
Please don't cry

02:03:09.799 --> 02:03:13.760
We both know I'm not what you

02:03:13.928 --> 02:03:17.013
You need

02:03:17.181 --> 02:03:26.731
And I will always love you

02:03:26.899 --> 02:03:34.280
I will always love you

02:03:37.368 --> 02:03:41.454
Our speaker this evening
has been a lone courageous voice.

02:03:41.705 --> 02:03:46.376
He alone has challenged those
who have linked organized crime...

02:03:46.669 --> 02:03:49.671
...with legitimate business
throughout our state.

02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:51.673
Welcome, congressman.

02:03:59.265 --> 02:04:03.393
First our benediction will be delivered
by Reverend Phillip Hardy...

02:04:03.686 --> 02:04:07.647
...of the First Presbyterian Church
of Iowa Rapids.

02:04:11.902 --> 02:04:13.862
Heavenly Father...

02:04:14.071 --> 02:04:17.907
...please bless us today
as we meet in friendship and duty.

02:04:18.909 --> 02:04:22.537
And, Lord, whatever dangerous endeavors
we may take...

02:04:22.788 --> 02:04:25.415
...let them never be
without your sanctuary.

02:04:26.542 --> 02:04:28.084
We all know in our hearts...

02:04:28.252 --> 02:04:31.754
...though we may pass through
the valley of the shadow of death...

02:04:32.006 --> 02:04:36.426
...you are with us,
guiding and protecting us.

02:04:37.511 --> 02:04:38.845
Amen.
