My mom and dad bought me
an archery set as a present.

shoot it in the apartment,

That's for the documentary

It's called a "double-doc."

I call it a "stalk-u-

For reasons that will
become clear when I release

07:52.556 --> 07:53.889
[moaning]

07:53.974 --> 07:55.557
[tina]
holy crap. Who is that?

07:55.642 --> 07:57.809
[andy]
that's our brother.
He wants to eat us.

07:57.853 --> 07:59.769
-He's a zombie now.
-He sure is.

07:59.855 --> 08:01.313
We're gonna be
dad's new favorites.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.939
-Dad's dead.
-Oh, yeah.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.274
[moaning]

08:04.401 --> 08:06.109
-[tina] damn.
-[bob] uh, closing this.

08:06.195 --> 08:07.319
-Uh-huh.
-[bob] tina.

08:07.404 --> 08:08.653
-Mmm.
-Tina.

08:08.739 --> 08:11.823
Okay, so, we're in
a zombie apocalypse situation.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.658
And we're not sure
how to kill them.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.202
Some of us say arrows.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.329
Some of us are weirdly insistent
that it might not be arrows.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.372
But I feel like
we should give it a shot,

08:19.500 --> 08:20.916
So to speak. [chuckles]

08:21.001 --> 08:22.834
I'm freaking out.
I don't want to die.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.045
Or un-die. How long
do we have to stay here?

08:25.172 --> 08:27.506
-What if we run out of food?
-We're in a restaurant, rudy.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.925
My mom and dad are making
all of us burgers right now.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.051
Oh. Hi.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.636
-Hi.
-Okay, I'm cool.

08:32.721 --> 08:35.764
I am the cool guy you do not
regret letting in. [chuckles]

08:35.849 --> 08:37.307
-Great.
-Oh, my god, what's that smell?!

08:37.392 --> 08:38.808
That's just the way
our restaurant smells.

08:38.936 --> 08:40.810
Okay. That's fine. That's great.
I'm doing good.

08:40.938 --> 08:42.479
[ollie]
my poor sweet andy.

08:42.564 --> 08:44.231
-You got bit.
-Just a little.

08:44.316 --> 08:46.274
Am I gonna turn into a zombie?

08:46.360 --> 08:48.235
If you do,
promise to bite me first,

08:48.362 --> 08:50.278
-And then we'll both be zombies.
-Ooh.

08:50.364 --> 08:52.030
And if anyone asks
about the bite,

08:52.115 --> 08:54.074
We'll just say
that you work in construction

08:54.201 --> 08:55.450
And it's a hazard of the job.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.202
-He works in construction!
-I work in construction!

08:57.287 --> 08:59.329
-It's a hazard of the job!
-It's a real job that I have!

08:59.414 --> 09:01.331
-[gene] okay, bros.
-[objects crashing]

09:01.458 --> 09:03.250
[bob]
oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.502
[tina]
how did they break through that?
We did such good barricading.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.379
[gene]
it's like the zombies
don't even appreciate

09:07.464 --> 09:08.838
How long it took us
to do all that.

09:08.966 --> 09:10.382
[linda]
kids, go to the basement!

09:10.467 --> 09:11.716
There's some crap down there
that we can use

09:11.843 --> 09:13.176
To reinforce this, I think.

09:13.345 --> 09:16.012
There's, uh, an old mop
and, uh, a lot of toilet paper.

09:16.098 --> 09:17.847
What are we gonna do
with toilet paper?

09:17.933 --> 09:19.558
-I don't know.
-[gene] tp their houses?

09:19.685 --> 09:21.518
I'll go.
Rudy, andy, ollie, come with me.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.645
-[both] yay!
-[rudy] wow, you're excited.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.105
-We like going places.
-I get it.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.481
[tina]
gene, go with them.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.650
Help, but keep filming.
Uh, but also, help.

09:28.777 --> 09:29.943
Filming is helping.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.195
Grab anything you can.

09:32.322 --> 09:33.446
[strains]

09:33.532 --> 09:35.782
[moaning]

09:35.909 --> 09:38.952
Andy, what's wrong?
Is your zombie bite acting up?

09:39.037 --> 09:40.495
Zombie bite?
Did you say "zombie bite"?

09:40.664 --> 09:43.248
I said "construction site
injury." that's what I said.

09:43.375 --> 09:46.459
-Uh, it sounded like you said
"zombie bite."
-I heard that, too.

09:46.545 --> 09:48.962
-Well, that's ridiculous.
-I think it's happening!

09:49.089 --> 09:50.046
[moaning]

09:50.173 --> 09:51.539
[louise]
oh, crap.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.633
-[gene screams]
-let's go, let's go, let's go!

09:53.719 --> 09:56.177
-Uh-huh.
-[gene] yep, yep.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.637
Brains!

09:57.764 --> 10:01.266
Is that a-a fun nickname,
'cause you think I'm smart?

10:01.393 --> 10:02.684
Brains!

10:02.728 --> 10:04.644
Yep. Ow! I love you.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.397
Ow! Love you. Ow! Not the ears.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.649
[moaning]

10:10.527 --> 10:11.735
[straining]

10:11.820 --> 10:13.236
Okay, basement
is off-limits now.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.281
We locked it, but yeah,
two small zombies in there.

10:16.325 --> 10:19.159
So how's it going here?

10:21.204 --> 10:22.871
-It's going really well.
-Yep.

10:22.998 --> 10:25.165
Louise, do something,
with the pointy sticks

10:25.250 --> 10:26.916
That you can shoot really fast
through the air.

10:27.002 --> 10:28.409
That would be helpful.

10:28.462 --> 10:29.961
Uh... [grunts]

10:30.088 --> 10:31.588
-Salt?
-I don't know!

10:31.715 --> 10:32.672
-Ow.
-Pepper?

10:32.758 --> 10:34.090
-I don't know.
-Mustard?

10:34.217 --> 10:37.135
Stop judging the things
we're throwing at zombies!

10:37.929 --> 10:38.803
[wailing]

10:38.889 --> 10:40.180
-[louise] ha!
-[tina] huh.

10:40.265 --> 10:41.306
[rudy]
zombies don't like mustard.

10:41.433 --> 10:42.307
Of course they don't. Who does?

10:42.392 --> 10:43.558
[bob]
mustard is great.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.810
Don't start
this argument again, louise.

10:45.937 --> 10:47.312
-Agree to disagree.
-[linda] I hate to interrupt,

10:47.397 --> 10:49.939
But I think you kids
should make a run for it.

10:50.067 --> 10:51.941
Oh. Yeah. Uh, okay.

10:52.027 --> 10:54.319
Uh, your mom and I are
gonna stay here and, uh,

10:54.446 --> 10:57.113
Hold these guys off,
and we-we got this.

10:57.199 --> 11:01.192
Uh, this is no problem, but
you should all go, really fast.

11:01.244 --> 11:02.911
Well, what about my really cool
mustard breakthrough?

11:02.996 --> 11:05.080
-Too many zombies.
-[gene] tmz.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.665
[strains] but it was
a really good breakthrough.

11:06.792 --> 11:09.668
Go! Maybe out the back door
and make a run for it!

11:09.795 --> 11:11.044
Oh! The fire escape.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.379
Back door, get on the dumpster,

11:12.506 --> 11:14.172
Get to the ladder
of the fire escape somehow,

11:14.257 --> 11:16.508
Lower it, get everybody up
and then pull it back up?

11:16.635 --> 11:18.677
-[gene] can you write
all that down for us?
-What?

11:18.762 --> 11:20.512
-Uh, no.
-Everyone, just go.

11:20.555 --> 11:23.306
Go now. And, uh, we'll, uh,
we'll meet you up there.

11:23.392 --> 11:25.433
-Okay, louise?
-Huh. Huh. Huh.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.477
-Oh, boy.
-Sounds like a lot of climbing,

11:27.562 --> 11:28.770
But all right.

11:28.855 --> 11:31.064
Okay.
We'll see you guys up there.

11:31.149 --> 11:32.232
-[bob] yep.
-Uh-huh.

11:32.317 --> 11:33.650
-[tina] we have to go now!
-Okay.

11:33.777 --> 11:35.110
[linda]
but if we're not up soon,

11:35.195 --> 11:37.904
Don't go to bed too late,
and stay out of my room.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.656
Hey, watch it!

11:39.783 --> 11:42.158
[tina]
wait for me!

11:43.704 --> 11:44.786
I'll climb up.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.371
Someone else, come up
and get on my shoulders.

11:46.498 --> 11:47.706
Do you know how to lower
the ladder?

11:47.833 --> 11:48.957
[louise]
of course I do. Do you know

11:49.000 --> 11:50.208
How many fires we've had
in our house?

11:50.377 --> 11:51.543
-A lot.
-[gene] good for you?

11:51.628 --> 11:53.670
Maybe hurry? Just to try that?

11:53.755 --> 11:55.213
-Get on my back.
-[grunting]

11:56.842 --> 11:58.633
-Uh, hurry, hurry.
-[gene] yes, please.

11:58.760 --> 11:59.801
[louise]
going as fast as we can.

11:59.928 --> 12:02.262
-Yep. Mm-hmm. Yep.
-[louise grunts]

12:02.389 --> 12:04.097
-Okay, I'm up.
-Climb up here.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.057
-Ladder?
-[louise] watch out.

12:06.143 --> 12:07.642
Thanks for the heads-up,
right after it happened.

12:07.769 --> 12:10.270
-[strains]
-[louise] quick, quick, quick!

12:10.355 --> 12:12.105
-Come on, gene.
-[rudy] oh, boy.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.023
-[whimpering]
-[shouts]

12:14.109 --> 12:15.775
-They got me!
-[tina] louise, shoot him!

12:15.944 --> 12:18.069
-Shoot me? Why?
-Not you! The zombie!

12:18.155 --> 12:20.238
[tina]
louise, shoot the zombie
with your bow and arrow!

12:20.365 --> 12:22.115
Oh, yeah, I'd be into that.

12:22.159 --> 12:24.743
Uh, uh... [straining]

12:27.914 --> 12:29.873
-I can't do it.
-[tina] what are you
talking about?

12:29.958 --> 12:32.917
I'm a fraud.
I'm an archery fraud.

12:33.003 --> 12:34.627
-[tina/gene] what?
-I can't pull the string back.

12:34.713 --> 12:37.046
I'm not strong enough.
I can't do archery at all.

12:37.132 --> 12:38.298
[rudy]
I didn't catch all that.

12:38.383 --> 12:39.549
Zombies are getting
kind of loud,

12:39.634 --> 12:41.509
But are you gonna
shoot the arrow soon?

12:41.595 --> 12:43.094
Now's good for me.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.266
-[wailing]
-I'm sorry.

12:48.393 --> 12:49.309
I'm a fraudy fraud pants.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.102
I can't do any archery stuff.

12:51.229 --> 12:53.646
Okay, now I heard
"I can't do archery stuff."

12:53.732 --> 12:55.106
That's disappointing.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.649
[tina]
give me that arrow.

12:56.735 --> 12:58.067
[grunting]

12:58.236 --> 13:00.528
-Here.
-I don't know if it works
without the bow part.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.072
Use it like a spear
or something. I don't know.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.866
Okay. [grunts]

13:04.951 --> 13:06.910
[shouts] brains!

13:06.995 --> 13:09.662
He doesn't seem to mind
that I did that to him.

13:09.748 --> 13:11.831
Isn't that a thing?
Getting them in the head?

13:11.917 --> 13:14.375
He's shaking his head no.
[shouts]

13:14.503 --> 13:15.668
-Uh...
-[louise] rudy!

13:15.796 --> 13:17.295
-I'm so sorry.
-[rudy] ow!

13:17.422 --> 13:20.673
It's fine. Ow! It's my fault
for being the slowpoke.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.342
Ow! It's actually not that bad.

13:22.427 --> 13:23.927
-[gene] really?
-I mean, it's pretty bad.

13:24.054 --> 13:26.346
But I don't want to be
remembered as a complainer.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.431
[screaming]

13:29.434 --> 13:30.975
[gene]
at least he went peacefully?

13:31.102 --> 13:32.602
[tina]
[grunts] why didn't you just

13:32.687 --> 13:33.853
Tell us the truth, louise?

13:34.022 --> 13:35.438
[louise]
I was embarrassed, okay?

13:35.524 --> 13:38.274
It's embarrassing. I mean,
I'm really bad at archery.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.943
Like, I can't pull
the string back

13:40.028 --> 13:42.362
And I haven't been able
to do it even once.

13:42.447 --> 13:43.822
So you just made
a bunch of fake videos?

13:43.949 --> 13:46.199
I was gonna make real videos,
but that didn't work out.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.992
Because of the whole
"being terrible at it" thing.

13:48.078 --> 13:50.161
There was a lot of editing,
come to think of it.

13:50.288 --> 13:52.205
One time, I did sort of see
a hand moving the arrow

13:52.290 --> 13:53.706
-Through the air.
-Yeah.

13:53.792 --> 13:56.918
But, hey, it turns out arrows
don't kill zombies anyway,

13:57.045 --> 13:58.795
So what are you gonna do?

13:58.880 --> 14:00.922
I guess we're safe up here.
