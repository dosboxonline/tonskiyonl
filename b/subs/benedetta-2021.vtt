"Benedetta"

01:21.430 --> 01:24.934
Subtitle by (lcb)

02:55.441 --> 02:59.320
Peace be with you, my sister.

03:00.446 --> 03:04.033
Do you want to sing a song?

03:26.263 --> 03:28.140
Who are you and what are you doing here?

03:28.265 --> 03:31.494
We accompany our daughter to the monastery of
Pescia, where our daughter will become a nun.

03:31.518 --> 03:33.771
Then they must have a
lot of money, Commander.

03:33.896 --> 03:35.623
They don't accept anyone
for free at the monastery!

03:35.647 --> 03:37.858
I travel with permit documents,
I do not carry money.

03:37.983 --> 03:42.154
You must have at least something
of value in your possession.

03:46.116 --> 03:47.659
Give us back that necklace.

03:47.785 --> 03:50.245
It belongs to my mother.

03:50.371 --> 03:52.122
She is braver than you!

03:52.289 --> 03:54.517
The Blessed Virgin will
punish you if you do not return it.

03:54.541 --> 03:55.751
How do you know girl.

03:55.876 --> 03:57.711
Our Lady does what I ask of her.

03:57.836 --> 04:02.007
It does not matter now...
that of the virgin.

04:02.132 --> 04:03.801
Do you hear it?

04:03.926 --> 04:05.761
It is the voice of the Virgin.

04:05.928 --> 04:09.598
She is showing that she is listening to me.

04:13.352 --> 04:15.979
Shit!

04:16.396 --> 04:17.648
TÃ³malo!

04:17.815 --> 04:20.317
Have fun with your virgin lady.

04:20.483 --> 04:23.153
Let's go!

05:17.541 --> 05:20.085
Good morning, Mr. Carlini.

05:20.210 --> 05:23.338
Please follow me.

05:30.387 --> 05:33.432
Wait here.

05:36.977 --> 05:41.356
I know you've brought
a new bride for Jesus.

05:41.523 --> 05:43.609
Benedetta will be very happy with us.

05:43.734 --> 05:47.654
We also brought a lot of
oranges, apples, and wine.

05:47.821 --> 05:50.616
And you will get the same amount for
the next twenty-five years.

05:50.741 --> 05:52.951
Every year.

05:53.076 --> 05:56.413
That's very generous of you, Mr. Carlini.

05:56.580 --> 05:59.875
And the deposit?

06:02.252 --> 06:05.380
When little Benedetta
was born, she was about to die.

06:05.505 --> 06:07.424
But she was saved by a miracle of God.

06:07.591 --> 06:09.384
So I promised to give it to him.

06:09.551 --> 06:11.261
This is very moving.

06:11.428 --> 06:13.263
I have heard many stories like this.

06:13.430 --> 06:15.766
And every time she affects me.

06:15.932 --> 06:21.313
But every year we see hundreds of
beautiful girls who want to serve God.

06:21.438 --> 06:23.482
These are this year's competitions.

06:23.607 --> 06:27.110
And I can only accept three.

06:27.319 --> 06:32.282
In exchange for your acceptance of my daughter, I will
be happy to present you with a gift of 50 gold coins.

06:32.449 --> 06:36.411
Not counting fruit and wine,
that's fine too, right?

06:36.578 --> 06:41.792
Outside these walls,
the bride price is not less than 50 coins.

06:41.958 --> 06:47.005
Is the bride of Christ worth less?

06:47.798 --> 06:49.091
We can discuss it.

06:49.216 --> 06:50.634
Seventy-five.

06:50.801 --> 06:52.886
Don't haggle like a Jew for 25 coins.

06:53.011 --> 06:57.474
And after all, Giuliano,
she is your sweet daughter.

06:57.808 --> 07:00.018
Agree.

07:00.143 --> 07:03.105
- A hundred coins!
- We don't buy horses here!

07:03.230 --> 07:04.981
Your word is enough for me.

07:05.148 --> 07:08.693
and your invoice.

07:19.621 --> 07:22.374
It is a very big one.

07:23.417 --> 07:27.129
- But it's beautiful.
- Take off your dress.

07:28.088 --> 07:29.506
What is this?

07:29.631 --> 07:30.757
It belongs to my mother.

07:30.882 --> 07:33.844
So that I can pray to Our Lady.

07:34.010 --> 07:36.555
Honey, here we have our own Virgin.

07:36.680 --> 07:38.640
From today you will pray it.

07:38.765 --> 07:41.309
- But it's mine.
- It's okay. Shut.

07:41.476 --> 07:44.229
The dress, now.

07:50.152 --> 07:52.320
Pica! It's terrible.

07:52.445 --> 07:53.989
This.

07:54.114 --> 07:56.158
Calm your body

07:56.283 --> 08:00.453
I should be satisfied with that.

08:04.624 --> 08:06.877
When I was a little older than you.

08:07.002 --> 08:10.505
While I was working
they cut my finger off with a knife.

08:10.672 --> 08:12.132
This finger is made of wood.

08:12.257 --> 08:14.885
And I love him more than the rest...

08:15.051 --> 08:16.386
..if I could

08:16.553 --> 08:18.763
I would replace every part of my body

08:18.889 --> 08:20.891
with pieces of wood,

08:21.057 --> 08:25.020
To engrave the name of God on it.

08:25.645 --> 08:29.065
And on your tombstone?

08:31.067 --> 08:33.361
You are a smart girl.

08:33.486 --> 08:36.698
Intelligence can be very dangerous, honey.

08:36.823 --> 08:39.909
and not only in others.

08:48.460 --> 08:52.047
Benedetta, she is here.

08:58.094 --> 09:00.847
Lady.

09:04.351 --> 09:07.270
This is the monastery room.

09:11.816 --> 09:14.694
Use this tomorrow.

09:56.403 --> 09:58.321
Oh Mary my good friend.

09:58.488 --> 10:00.532
Now you are my mum.

10:00.657 --> 10:04.744
Please help.
I am totally alone.

10:04.869 --> 10:08.540
I don't even know if you can hear me now.

10:21.761 --> 10:24.806
Benedetta?

10:24.973 --> 10:27.100
You got hurt?

10:27.225 --> 10:30.270
Raise the statue.

10:36.401 --> 10:37.652
Did you touch the statue?

10:37.777 --> 10:42.073
No. Something happened to him and
he fell on me - What were you doing here?

10:42.240 --> 10:45.577
I wanted to pray to the Virgin.

10:45.702 --> 10:48.872
Are you able to stand up?

10:49.330 --> 10:51.875
Yes.

10:52.375 --> 10:56.087
It is a miracle that it
has not been crushed.

10:57.547 --> 11:01.426
It's okay.
Go to sleep and let Benedetta rest.

11:01.551 --> 11:04.179
Come.

11:08.766 --> 11:11.269
Mother!

11:11.394 --> 11:13.646
Wasn't this a miracle, perhaps?

11:13.813 --> 11:15.773
No gossip.

11:15.899 --> 11:18.193
Miracles don't grow
everywhere like breakfast.

11:18.359 --> 11:21.196
Most of the time, they are just events.

11:21.321 --> 11:24.824
I didn't believe so much

11:27.619 --> 11:32.040
18 years later

11:32.165 --> 11:35.793
I long to see my son, Jesus.

11:35.919 --> 11:38.922
I long to see her body again.

11:39.088 --> 11:40.506
Oh Lord.

11:40.632 --> 11:42.550
We know that you are immortal

11:42.717 --> 11:44.302
I saw an angel.

11:44.427 --> 11:46.638
He told me that night.

11:46.804 --> 11:50.934
Cheer up, your son will live.

11:51.434 --> 11:54.562
And in your presence my brothers

11:54.729 --> 11:56.189
I pray tirelessly.

11:56.314 --> 11:59.859
Oh noble lady,
full of grace and wisdom.

11:59.984 --> 12:03.363
You are our consolation.

12:06.866 --> 12:11.496
Now I'll lay down in this bed made for me.

13:10.304 --> 13:13.182
"Benedetta"!

13:15.184 --> 13:16.811
Come!

13:16.936 --> 13:19.647
You are my wife.

13:19.814 --> 13:22.650
Come now!

13:23.025 --> 13:25.820
I'm coming, my God! I'm going.

13:25.987 --> 13:29.532
Come!

13:36.622 --> 13:40.001
Benedetta, your feet!

13:58.269 --> 14:01.564
This banquet was organized by us
for our honourable guest.

14:01.731 --> 14:03.274
Giuliano Carlini.

14:03.399 --> 14:06.611
Cheers.

14:08.070 --> 14:13.910
Let us also remember our beloved
Bishop of Milan, who left us last week.

14:14.076 --> 14:17.538
Did you hear that the cause
of his death was the plague?

14:17.663 --> 14:19.916
That's how it is.

14:20.041 --> 14:23.336
The bishop was a brave man.

14:24.337 --> 14:29.050
But I doubted that this
meeting would make you change your mind.

14:29.175 --> 14:35.097
If this is the will of God, then the place
of the bishop will be for his Eminence.

14:35.223 --> 14:37.683
No. No. This is really sad.

14:37.850 --> 14:42.104
To do this we must walk without shame,
above our heads in the Vatican.

14:42.271 --> 14:46.400
And I'm not that kind of person.

14:46.525 --> 14:50.112
And if the Pope notices this
place on the map, it will be a miracle.

14:50.279 --> 14:55.660
Let's hope for a geographical miracle.

15:01.540 --> 15:03.918
Why did you move your legs?

15:04.043 --> 15:07.588
You should have been dead.

15:08.130 --> 15:10.800
I have seen Jesus.

15:10.925 --> 15:13.970
He called me.

15:15.763 --> 15:18.099
I'm his girlfriend, right?

15:18.265 --> 15:21.560
Yes of course.

15:23.729 --> 15:25.564
Help me!

15:25.690 --> 15:26.941
- Open the door for me.
- Open.

15:27.066 --> 15:30.319
Help me please!

15:30.486 --> 15:33.280
Open up!

15:38.869 --> 15:39.869
Help me!

15:39.954 --> 15:41.831
No, it's coming! please.

15:41.998 --> 15:43.207
Get away!

15:43.332 --> 15:44.542
She ran away from me!

15:44.667 --> 15:46.127
You are mine, bitch!

15:46.293 --> 15:49.922
No, don't give up on me, please!

15:50.047 --> 15:53.009
Come. Come.

15:53.426 --> 15:55.094
You want to fight?

15:55.219 --> 15:58.305
They are in a monastery!

15:58.848 --> 16:00.016
I love Christ.

16:00.182 --> 16:02.059
- Help me.
- I'm the father of this girl.

16:02.226 --> 16:04.937
- It belongs to me.
- Let me stay here.

16:05.104 --> 16:08.190
But... the monastery is not a place
where everyone is accepted.

16:08.357 --> 16:10.151
You have to pay to stay here.

16:10.317 --> 16:12.278
you have money?

16:12.445 --> 16:14.572
- No.
- Come on. Come on, that's enough.

16:14.697 --> 16:16.157
No!

16:16.323 --> 16:17.825
Let me!

16:17.950 --> 16:19.994
I want to serve the Lord!

16:20.161 --> 16:21.454
Please help her!

16:21.579 --> 16:23.330
We will pay your bill!

16:23.456 --> 16:25.207
Do you want me to pay a strange girl?

16:25.332 --> 16:27.960
I will pray for you all my life!

16:28.127 --> 16:29.879
Marvellous!

16:30.045 --> 16:31.756
Mr. Carlini.

16:31.881 --> 16:35.009
The rich will not enter the kingdom of God.

16:35.134 --> 16:37.094
Are you ready to pay?

16:37.219 --> 16:43.184
And you, mum,
don't you do everything to get to heaven?

16:43.517 --> 16:45.311
Well.

16:45.478 --> 16:49.106
It will be a gift for you, Benedetta.

16:49.273 --> 16:50.441
How to be a gift?

16:50.566 --> 16:53.194
My daughter is mine.
You cannot buy it.

16:53.360 --> 16:56.322
- I'll give you ten dinars, no more.
- Bring it!

16:56.447 --> 17:00.367
Not the price of the dogs
that will replace this bitch.

17:25.017 --> 17:26.310
Well.

17:26.477 --> 17:29.563
That's great.

17:29.688 --> 17:32.525
Take a bath.

17:34.985 --> 17:37.071
It will help you.

17:37.196 --> 17:38.697
What is your name?

17:38.864 --> 17:40.574
I am Sister Benedetta, and you?

17:40.741 --> 17:42.660
Bartholomew.

17:42.785 --> 17:44.161
BartolomÃ©a... what?

17:44.328 --> 17:46.121
Just BartolomÃ©a.

17:46.288 --> 17:47.748
Is it mandatory to shower here?

17:47.873 --> 17:49.917
A pure soul requires a pure body.

17:50.084 --> 17:51.835
The water is very cold.

17:52.002 --> 17:55.089
No, no, wait.

17:56.840 --> 17:59.051
I almost fall.

17:59.218 --> 18:02.721
Will you stay with me for a while?

18:02.846 --> 18:05.391
Sister Benedetta?

18:05.516 --> 18:09.061
Your nightgown on the table.

18:21.991 --> 18:23.867
Sister Benedetta?

18:24.034 --> 18:27.454
I need to defecate, where do I go?

18:30.874 --> 18:33.794
come with me.

18:36.714 --> 18:38.549
Are they real seats with drains?

18:38.716 --> 18:40.068
Where have you been doing that before?

18:40.092 --> 18:43.637
In the street with the cattle.

18:54.356 --> 18:55.858
What a good feeling!

18:56.025 --> 19:00.529
- What a relief!
- Shh! You can't scream like that at night!

19:01.530 --> 19:04.742
I hope this is not prohibited.

19:04.908 --> 19:07.536
Waiting.

19:19.673 --> 19:21.508
Excuse me, who did that to you?

19:21.675 --> 19:23.260
My father.

19:23.427 --> 19:26.305
Why?

19:26.555 --> 19:32.895
My mother died of the general plague of
the past, then my father took me as his wife.

19:33.937 --> 19:38.901
I always said I didn't want to,
and he always said he didn't care.

19:39.067 --> 19:41.987
- As a wife, in the sense of everything?
- If all.

19:42.112 --> 19:47.159
My brothers used to do the same,
when the old man saw nothing.

19:47.326 --> 19:51.455
Today I tried to stab
him with a pair of scissors.

19:51.580 --> 19:53.123
He didn't like it, so he hit me.

19:53.290 --> 19:56.502
So I ran away.

19:59.004 --> 20:00.380
Beauty can have a tax.

20:00.547 --> 20:04.051
Even if it looked like a sheep,
the same would happen to me.

20:04.218 --> 20:07.679
Do you think me beautiful?

20:07.846 --> 20:11.141
Don't you realize it yourself?

20:11.767 --> 20:15.270
No, we don't have a mirror.

20:15.437 --> 20:17.523
You're beautiful.

20:17.689 --> 20:21.527
Can you see your reflection in my eyes.

20:25.280 --> 20:29.034
- I don't see anything.
- Come closer.

20:32.204 --> 20:35.332
Now look.

20:37.042 --> 20:40.504
What are you two doing here?

20:41.380 --> 20:44.967
I have brought the sister
to the resting place.

20:50.597 --> 20:52.057
Who is she?

20:52.182 --> 20:54.851
Christina, the nun.

20:54.977 --> 20:59.231
And is she always spying like this?

21:22.337 --> 21:28.677
Father, I feel that BartolomÃ©a
needs a mentor, but I cannot teach him.

21:29.094 --> 21:31.722
God is the one who sent this girl.

21:31.847 --> 21:35.934
You need a lot of love and affection.

21:36.101 --> 21:39.229
Yes, it must be guided with an iron fist.

21:39.354 --> 21:41.815
not through me.

21:41.982 --> 21:45.527
May god guide you.

22:49.925 --> 22:53.261
Save me, Jesus!

23:03.063 --> 23:04.689
What did these monsters want?

23:04.815 --> 23:06.525
Kill you.

23:06.650 --> 23:10.153
These are the demons that
tried to keep us away from each other.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.322
But they are stupid.

23:12.489 --> 23:17.035
Neither life nor death can separate us.

23:26.503 --> 23:28.672
Stay with me.

23:28.839 --> 23:32.175
Yes Jesus.

23:34.761 --> 23:38.265
I'll stay with you.

24:20.807 --> 24:23.101
Speak sister.

24:23.268 --> 24:25.895
Dad.

24:26.062 --> 24:28.815
I have seen Jesus.

24:28.940 --> 24:32.235
- In a dream?
- No.

24:32.610 --> 24:34.279
Of flesh and blood.

24:34.446 --> 24:37.782
How do I see you now in front of me.

24:38.658 --> 24:41.995
When you saw it, how did you feel?

24:42.120 --> 24:45.832
- ...fearfully.
- So it was a false vision.

24:45.957 --> 24:50.253
When Christ becomes incarnate for us,
we are filled with joy.

24:50.754 --> 24:55.050
How do I know what is
right and what is wrong?

24:55.508 --> 24:57.469
Through suffering.

24:57.594 --> 25:01.931
Suffering is the only way to know Christ

25:02.307 --> 25:06.561
I know God wants us to suffer, Father
...but.

25:07.187 --> 25:10.023
- That would scare me.
- It's normal.

25:10.190 --> 25:13.026
God's voice is often terrifying

25:13.193 --> 25:14.694
...the idiot says

25:14.861 --> 25:18.531
I'm not scared
but I know he's scared to death.

25:18.656 --> 25:22.994
Have you ever seen how a surgeon works?

25:23.119 --> 25:25.622
Do you really enjoy suffering?

25:25.747 --> 25:29.626
Keep praying and everything will be fine.

25:29.876 --> 25:34.047
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

25:51.231 --> 25:52.482
And spools of silk thread?

25:52.607 --> 25:54.317
Do you know how much it costs?

25:54.484 --> 25:57.112
How stupid you are! You ran into me!

25:57.278 --> 25:59.531
- Excuse me?
- It's your fault.

25:59.697 --> 26:02.367
Stop lying.

26:02.492 --> 26:05.120
You are the reason. Saw that.

26:05.286 --> 26:09.833
- Take the rollers out of the pot.
- But... the water is boiling.

26:09.958 --> 26:14.128
Get him out quick or
I'll send for your dad.

26:36.401 --> 26:39.487
And now the rest.

26:40.113 --> 26:41.573
Do I have to do that again?

26:41.698 --> 26:45.285
Otherwise, the reels will be damaged.

26:47.245 --> 26:50.081
No. Stop.
What is it?

26:50.248 --> 26:53.626
What's going on here?

26:54.419 --> 26:57.964
BartolomÃ©a burned his hand.

26:58.214 --> 27:00.466
- Come on, everyone to work!
- Sister Petra!

27:00.592 --> 27:02.427
You need to go to the infirmary.

27:02.552 --> 27:05.972
Take it then.

27:11.394 --> 27:16.899
You found out that one of your sisters had damaged
the silk curlers, so you decided for yourself.

27:17.066 --> 27:18.818
To punish her.

27:18.943 --> 27:22.530
No mother.

27:23.197 --> 27:27.535
- No?
- I didn't want to punish her, but to hurt her.

27:27.660 --> 27:31.372
...you wanted to cause one of
your sisters pain. intentionally.

27:31.539 --> 27:33.625
Yes, by the way.

27:33.750 --> 27:37.045
Wasn't that a malicious motive?

27:37.211 --> 27:40.006
If you think it was for a
malicious motive, I'd say it's true.

27:40.131 --> 27:43.926
Don't you know your true feelings?

27:44.093 --> 27:47.263
It seems I don't.

27:56.439 --> 27:59.859
BartolomÃ©a... did something bother you?

27:59.984 --> 28:00.984
No.

28:01.027 --> 28:05.490
- Do you hate her for some reason?
- No.

28:08.576 --> 28:12.705
Do you have feelings for her?

28:14.582 --> 28:18.127
I feel... sympathy. Yes.

28:18.294 --> 28:19.712
without suffering.

28:19.837 --> 28:22.090
Including what you did to him yourself?

28:22.256 --> 28:27.845
Yes, but Father Recordati told me that
pain leads us to God and makes us stronger.

28:28.012 --> 28:30.515
...our suffering.

28:30.681 --> 28:33.893
Without suffering from others.

28:36.354 --> 28:37.939
Your enthusiasm has gone too far

28:38.106 --> 28:39.690
I'll take your bread away for a week.

28:39.816 --> 28:43.152
And for two weeks, you'll
change Sister Jacob's sheets.

28:43.319 --> 28:44.821
You can go.

28:44.946 --> 28:48.324
I'm ready mother.

29:10.138 --> 29:12.807
- Sister, I have to help you.
- Get away.

29:12.932 --> 29:15.351
I have had problems at
work and I am proud of it.

29:15.518 --> 29:18.855
Pride is a mortal sin.

29:19.105 --> 29:22.608
Everyone has the right to make mistakes.

29:22.775 --> 29:25.403
What is your sin

29:25.528 --> 29:28.656
I never did anything wrong.

29:29.157 --> 29:33.536
- But I know you can make a mistake.
- Of course.

29:33.703 --> 29:36.539
Help me.

29:37.415 --> 29:39.083
..my sin.

29:39.250 --> 29:42.211
That I was Jewish.

29:42.336 --> 29:44.046
Sister Petra was a whore.

29:44.171 --> 29:48.259
They all have children and a past,
but nobody cares.

29:48.384 --> 29:51.637
And my father was circumcised.

29:51.762 --> 29:56.976
This is a sin that cannot be forgiven.

30:07.695 --> 30:11.616
You just discovered one of my secrets.

30:12.199 --> 30:15.328
Do you call it that?

30:16.454 --> 30:20.666
God speaks in many languages.

30:21.709 --> 30:26.547
If your heart is brave
enough to open it up.

31:31.195 --> 31:32.446
Â¡AlÃ©jense!

31:32.613 --> 31:36.409
Let the leading nuns come in!

31:39.453 --> 31:42.289
Help me!

31:44.041 --> 31:47.002
Save me!

31:56.220 --> 31:59.098
Tie it there.

31:59.765 --> 32:03.269
Go find the doctor.

32:18.409 --> 32:19.535
How is she?

32:19.660 --> 32:22.538
I watered it with poppy extract.
she is sleeping.

32:22.705 --> 32:23.789
Why is he suffering?

32:23.956 --> 32:25.916
I did not find anything abnormal.

32:26.083 --> 32:27.960
However, it was obvious
that he was suffering.

32:28.127 --> 32:30.713
She was screaming for
hours without stopping.

32:30.880 --> 32:33.048
You have black mucus in your urine.

32:33.174 --> 32:35.551
This happens a lot.

32:35.718 --> 32:37.386
What happens if the seizure recurs?

32:37.511 --> 32:41.098
I leave you the poppy extract.

32:41.640 --> 32:44.560
Twenty dinars.

33:08.042 --> 33:11.211
Why are you so cruel?

33:19.762 --> 33:23.140
Do you want to be with me?

33:28.103 --> 33:31.357
I want to be with you.

34:24.618 --> 34:28.539
No! No!

34:34.585 --> 34:37.339
No!

34:52.771 --> 34:55.524
"Jesus"!

34:58.402 --> 35:02.322
Thank you Jesus!

35:03.907 --> 35:05.451
"Benedetta"

35:05.576 --> 35:06.994
I will heal your wounds.

35:07.161 --> 35:08.871
You are not Jesus!

35:08.996 --> 35:10.873
I am Jesus.

35:10.998 --> 35:13.000
- And you are my wife!
- No!

35:13.125 --> 35:16.086
This is a lie!

35:17.045 --> 35:19.965
Surrender to me!

35:22.968 --> 35:27.264
!Enough.
I will cut you to pieces.

36:11.058 --> 36:14.895
You will have a roommate.

36:16.480 --> 36:19.399
Thanks.

36:29.451 --> 36:30.953
"Benedetta"!

36:31.078 --> 36:33.080
Are you feeling better now?

36:33.246 --> 36:35.874
I feel what God wants me to feel.

36:35.999 --> 36:38.543
I decided to put a companion next to you.

36:38.669 --> 36:40.629
Will stay with you day and night.

36:40.754 --> 36:44.132
She will take care of
you and pray with you.

36:44.299 --> 36:46.593
She will give you your medicine if needed.

36:46.718 --> 36:48.804
I don't want to be a burden.

36:48.929 --> 36:52.808
Let's see if this helps.

36:56.728 --> 37:00.732
BartolomÃ©a is the
perfect sister for work

37:00.899 --> 37:05.070
I hope there is something to
appreciate in this selection.

37:05.237 --> 37:08.740
Maybe a lesson in tolerance.

37:13.912 --> 37:17.082
Why are you here?

37:17.290 --> 37:18.667
Did you come to torture me?

37:18.792 --> 37:22.963
Did I do something to make you think that?

37:34.599 --> 37:38.520
How can you put something here?

37:44.484 --> 37:48.655
It's the dress I was
wearing when I came here.

38:01.626 --> 38:04.337
Yes?

38:06.131 --> 38:08.967
It is a statue of my mother.

38:09.134 --> 38:12.471
She gave it to me when I was little.

38:13.138 --> 38:17.976
Well, we'll put it... there.

38:30.947 --> 38:33.283
The devil followed me

38:33.450 --> 38:35.744
I tried to hurt myself.

38:35.869 --> 38:38.914
Now it's gone.

38:48.715 --> 38:50.675
Have you ever gotten out of bed?

38:50.842 --> 38:52.928
I still don't feel good.

38:53.053 --> 38:55.889
The head of the monasteries
asked me for help.

38:56.056 --> 38:58.725
What is this?

38:58.850 --> 39:01.019
Preparation.

39:01.186 --> 39:04.147
I don't know her.

39:04.272 --> 39:07.150
I can teach you.

39:07.359 --> 39:10.028
Studying things didn't go well for me.

39:10.153 --> 39:11.738
It is too hot.

39:11.863 --> 39:13.406
Is there something else?

39:13.531 --> 39:14.950
No thanks.

39:15.075 --> 39:18.411
I'm going to bed.

39:32.759 --> 39:35.428
Can I see a little?

39:35.595 --> 39:38.390
We cannot be naked in front of others.

39:38.556 --> 39:41.476
Oh really?

39:54.072 --> 39:57.033
I saw you!

39:57.325 --> 39:59.369
That was a joke.

39:59.536 --> 40:03.206
You really are the clown sister.

40:03.665 --> 40:06.751
Maybe.

40:17.554 --> 40:20.682
I saw your boobs.

40:26.271 --> 40:29.441
I saw them.

40:47.876 --> 40:50.795
"Benedetta"

40:51.755 --> 40:54.632
"Benedetta"

41:03.433 --> 41:07.812
Do you want to suffer to show me your love?

41:09.773 --> 41:12.692
Take off your clothes.

41:12.859 --> 41:15.979
We are prohibited from taking off our
clothes in the presence of other people.

41:16.070 --> 41:17.489
And accept?

41:17.614 --> 41:21.075
You shouldn't be ashamed of me.

41:21.242 --> 41:24.287
Do what I say.

41:24.496 --> 41:26.831
Present, sir.

41:26.998 --> 41:29.959
I obey you.

41:35.548 --> 41:38.927
Come.

41:53.483 --> 41:56.986
Take away what divides us.

42:06.788 --> 42:10.416
Put your hands on mine.

42:29.519 --> 42:32.230
Oh God.

42:32.355 --> 42:35.024
"Jesus.

42:41.656 --> 42:45.952
That's a lot! I can not anymore.

42:57.297 --> 42:59.465
Help me. Help me!

42:59.590 --> 43:02.427
Help me!

43:34.292 --> 43:37.795
Jesus, who did this?

43:38.254 --> 43:40.965
Last night.

43:41.132 --> 43:44.343
He did this.

43:46.679 --> 43:49.265
This too.

43:49.390 --> 43:52.393
The stigmata!

44:11.204 --> 44:14.457
Were you in prayer when this happened?

44:14.582 --> 44:17.502
I was in bed, asleep,

44:17.627 --> 44:19.545
When did that happen.

44:19.712 --> 44:24.091
Saint Francis was in
prayer when he received the stigmata

44:24.217 --> 44:26.844
Katrina from Siena too.

44:26.969 --> 44:29.305
Neither of us was asleep

44:29.430 --> 44:31.682
I was sleeping.

44:31.849 --> 44:36.020
- Jesus left these traces.
- He was 'Jesus'. Saw that.

44:36.145 --> 44:38.439
You've seen?

44:38.564 --> 44:41.484
I heard him speak.

44:41.609 --> 44:44.320
And what did he say?

44:45.238 --> 44:48.074
I do not remember.

44:48.616 --> 44:52.828
I thought the word of God
made more impressions.

44:52.995 --> 44:57.041
Bring sister Benedetta to my room.

45:17.937 --> 45:20.898
Are you going to open the door?

45:26.362 --> 45:29.198
Wounds bleed non-stop.

45:29.323 --> 45:32.159
Is deep.

45:32.326 --> 45:34.996
Sight.

45:42.503 --> 45:44.505
The legs are the same.

45:44.630 --> 45:47.758
- It's swollen?
- Even worse.

45:47.925 --> 45:49.427
How can this happen?

45:49.552 --> 45:52.221
I do not know.
I have not seen this.

45:52.346 --> 45:54.015
What can we do?

45:54.140 --> 45:55.516
Keep clean.

45:55.641 --> 45:58.769
Change bandages every two hours.

45:58.936 --> 46:02.148
Take off his cap.

46:10.072 --> 46:12.658
There is no blood.

46:12.783 --> 46:15.536
It's strange!

46:15.953 --> 46:18.998
When they put a crown of thorns on him.

46:19.123 --> 46:22.585
Jesus' forehead was bleeding.

46:23.044 --> 46:25.004
I see nothing.

46:25.171 --> 46:26.756
Inspection is over.

46:26.881 --> 46:29.633
And close the door.

46:32.678 --> 46:34.805
Do you have any doubt?

46:34.930 --> 46:36.891
The girl was in bed.

46:37.016 --> 46:39.477
Miracles don't happen in bed, believe me.

46:39.643 --> 46:42.980
Then? what I write?

46:44.774 --> 46:48.861
The absence of scars
on the head is puzzling.

46:49.028 --> 46:54.658
All confirmed cases of scars
included crown of thorns.

46:54.825 --> 46:58.662
Let's not write anything definitive.

46:59.121 --> 47:01.665
You agree with me?

47:01.832 --> 47:03.876
- Your Eminence?
- Yes, my daughter.

47:04.043 --> 47:05.711
I can go.

47:05.878 --> 47:08.714
Naturally.

47:12.384 --> 47:14.595
Do I have wine if you want?

47:14.762 --> 47:17.765
Gladly.

47:18.390 --> 47:21.936
Please let me go.

47:31.153 --> 47:33.572
Do you think this miracle
should not be believed?

47:33.739 --> 47:38.327
Dear director of the monastery,
I think you do not believe it at all.

47:38.452 --> 47:40.454
Do I look sarcastic?

47:40.579 --> 47:42.039
Maybe.

47:42.206 --> 47:45.584
Only now I have the same vision.

47:45.751 --> 47:48.212
This is very possible.

47:48.379 --> 47:51.590
Like the ones in San Francisco.

47:51.715 --> 47:54.802
Assisi was an unknown people.

47:54.927 --> 47:57.346
Now the pilgrims flow to him like a river.

47:57.513 --> 47:59.557
And they fill the treasure of the Basilica.

47:59.682 --> 48:04.019
That is ruled by a bishop, not an abbot.

48:06.063 --> 48:09.483
Jesus, what's wrong with me?

48:20.369 --> 48:22.037
..morning.

48:22.204 --> 48:24.665
You will know! you sinners.

48:24.790 --> 48:27.459
The plague is coming and it
will be a terrible punishment!

48:27.626 --> 48:32.923
And I will save you from
that with a blessing .. my wife.

48:33.048 --> 48:40.389
And here they persecute, torture
and kill whoever saves them!

48:48.939 --> 48:49.982
What happened?

48:50.149 --> 48:53.027
I have fallen.

48:55.863 --> 48:59.033
This is not a miracle.

48:59.199 --> 49:01.910
Your Eminence, this has gone too far.

49:02.077 --> 49:05.539
Do you want to bring
the wrath of heaven on us?

49:05.664 --> 49:08.000
You heard the words she said just now.

49:08.167 --> 49:12.463
- ...I heard words, but.
- Will you laugh at me too?

49:14.631 --> 49:18.344
These disturbing words
belong to the voice of the Lord.

49:18.469 --> 49:20.679
I feel this with all my heart.

49:20.846 --> 49:25.851
This is a true miracle.
How can you deny it?

49:27.061 --> 49:30.105
I do not deny it, Your Eminence.

49:30.230 --> 49:33.150
You are pretending to be good.

49:33.275 --> 49:36.320
And when I turn around,
you stick a knife in my back.

49:36.487 --> 49:42.409
Hassan. Let's see what God will give
each of us in life.

49:46.205 --> 49:49.500
BendÃ­cenos, Benedetta.

49:49.750 --> 49:53.045
Â¡Santa Benedetta!

49:57.007 --> 49:59.635
People want to believe that
Benedetta has become a saint.

49:59.760 --> 50:03.388
But we know it doesn't make sense.

50:03.847 --> 50:04.681
Oh really?

50:04.848 --> 50:07.935
You said yourself that he had no
scars on his forehead.

50:08.060 --> 50:09.770
The glass was immediately shattered.

50:09.895 --> 50:11.396
And the blood appeared.

50:11.522 --> 50:15.109
Did you see that? You were there?

50:15.943 --> 50:19.863
- No.
- Then you don't know anything.

50:24.409 --> 50:26.620
I did not see anything.

50:26.745 --> 50:29.123
- But I know,
- and how did you know?

50:29.248 --> 50:31.208
Did God incarnate you?

50:31.333 --> 50:34.753
Do you also have a vision?

50:45.472 --> 50:48.559
Why do you defend her?

50:52.855 --> 50:55.983
We don't always understand how God works.

50:56.108 --> 50:59.444
Maybe he put Benedetta in a trance
...and then she's in that state.

50:59.611 --> 51:02.364
His wounds appeared.

51:02.489 --> 51:06.326
...or God drove her crazy.

51:06.743 --> 51:11.206
And that was necessary for
something he wanted to say.

51:18.463 --> 51:21.758
I want you to give me your heart.

51:21.884 --> 51:25.012
Won't I die without a heart?

51:25.137 --> 51:28.682
You will live. you love Me?

51:28.807 --> 51:30.892
How am I going to live without a heart?

51:31.018 --> 51:33.395
I will give you something better.

51:33.562 --> 51:36.231
My heart.

51:39.860 --> 51:42.863
Bartholomew.

51:43.989 --> 51:47.451
- What is there?
- Jesus gave me his heart.

51:47.618 --> 51:50.412
It is a very big one.

51:50.537 --> 51:53.582
Too big for my chest.

51:53.707 --> 51:56.585
Check it out.

51:56.752 --> 52:00.088
Look how big it is.

52:18.565 --> 52:22.694
I feel so. Yes.

52:26.239 --> 52:29.284
- What is there?
- Benedetta had a nightmare.

52:29.409 --> 52:32.204
Everything is fine.

52:32.329 --> 52:35.290
Good evening.

52:35.582 --> 52:38.835
Come on, go to sleep.

53:34.307 --> 53:37.394
Something miraculous happened to us.

53:37.519 --> 53:44.276
"Jesus Christ" Christ chose
one of our sisters .. "Benedetta."

53:44.442 --> 53:46.987
We have all seen it.

53:47.112 --> 53:48.989
And we hear the words "Jesus".

53:49.114 --> 53:50.991
Subahwa Lillarb.

53:51.116 --> 53:52.742
Bless God.

53:52.909 --> 53:55.203
..."chosen" by Jesus.

53:55.328 --> 53:59.749
.. Therefore, we are the supreme
authority of the Church.

53:59.875 --> 54:04.546
We have chosen Benedetta
as abbot of the nunnery.

54:04.713 --> 54:09.593
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

54:09.718 --> 54:11.177
Amen.

54:11.303 --> 54:15.640
...to pray to our Lord Maulana.

54:20.020 --> 54:21.479
This is impossible.

54:21.646 --> 54:23.273
Sister Christina...

54:23.398 --> 54:26.401
what do you have?

54:29.237 --> 54:32.699
With all due respect to you, father.

54:32.866 --> 54:34.784
We.

54:34.910 --> 54:37.954
We, the sisters of this monastery.

54:38.121 --> 54:40.332
Who should we choose
a new abbot from a monastery?

54:40.457 --> 54:43.501
And it's just us Jesus, chose her.

54:43.668 --> 54:45.587
Your Lord and your God.

54:45.712 --> 54:47.172
It is the will of God.

54:47.339 --> 54:50.425
But who decides what the will of God is?

54:50.550 --> 54:53.887
- Aren't we, sisters?
- 'Christina '-

54:54.012 --> 54:56.848
Get out of here.

54:59.267 --> 55:01.978
Immediately.

55:12.489 --> 55:14.783
Solved case.

55:14.908 --> 55:16.201
..I will ask,

55:16.368 --> 55:20.664
to the abbot of the nuns of
the monastery to deliver his mandate.

55:35.220 --> 55:37.347
Sister Benedetta.

55:37.472 --> 55:40.183
Come closer.

56:43.538 --> 56:44.998
What a bed!

56:45.123 --> 56:48.668
It's my bed, it's double.

56:52.547 --> 56:56.301
And it's all for us!

57:04.851 --> 57:06.436
Sister Jacob has fallen!

57:06.561 --> 57:09.564
He can no longer move.

57:21.242 --> 57:24.579
I don't think I'll get over this day.

57:24.746 --> 57:27.624
I will stay by her side
and take care of her.

57:27.790 --> 57:29.667
Naturally.

57:29.792 --> 57:33.087
But someone will have to
take his place during Mass.

57:33.254 --> 57:36.549
Today I will serve the first
mass as abbot of the monastery.

57:36.674 --> 57:40.094
I think you should be there.

57:40.219 --> 57:42.722
Well, priestess in chief.

57:42.847 --> 57:44.807
I'll stay with sister jacoba.

57:44.933 --> 57:46.476
Until dawn if necessary.

57:46.643 --> 57:48.269
Excellent.

57:48.436 --> 57:51.606
Jesus said nothing about your condition.

58:00.323 --> 58:03.201
He's making fun of you,
but you didn't say anything.

58:03.326 --> 58:05.119
These are the rules of the game.

58:05.244 --> 58:07.705
In the end, everyone wins.

58:07.872 --> 58:09.707
The abbot of the monastery
will become bishop

58:09.874 --> 58:11.810
and the monastery will
receive financial benefits.

58:11.834 --> 58:14.212
Is this important?

58:14.379 --> 58:20.009
It may not be important or even useless,
but I have dedicated my life to it.

58:22.804 --> 58:26.432
I was afraid of life,
so I chose to give it to this monastery.

58:26.557 --> 58:29.936
Or maybe I was chosen for that.

58:30.520 --> 58:34.899
- But mum, you can't leave like this.
- Call me Sister Felicita.

58:35.066 --> 58:36.442
..but people need to know.

58:36.609 --> 58:38.194
This is what is called rowing.

58:38.361 --> 58:40.905
What they need to know, they already know.

58:41.030 --> 58:43.074
If they don't lie, Benedetta...

58:43.241 --> 58:46.369
Because they don't need this denial.

58:46.536 --> 58:49.205
If you do that they will destroy you.

58:49.372 --> 58:52.250
Everything is fine.

58:52.417 --> 58:55.545
I'm not going to defend you.

58:57.088 --> 59:01.384
It's time for mass, Sister Felicita.

59:43.092 --> 59:46.012
Ugly dream.

01:00:26.844 --> 01:00:28.930
Dad.

01:00:29.055 --> 01:00:30.431
I need to confess.

01:00:30.556 --> 01:00:34.393
- at this time?
- I really need it, father, please.

01:00:34.518 --> 01:00:38.147
Kneel before the cross
before the Lord and repent.

01:00:38.314 --> 01:00:41.150
God taught me never to lie.

01:00:41.317 --> 01:00:44.904
This is why it is so urgent.

01:01:05.299 --> 01:01:11.347
Speak, renew your connection with our
God "Jesus" the living Christ.

01:01:12.473 --> 01:01:14.934
It's about Sister Benedetta,
I came to tell you that...

01:01:15.101 --> 01:01:18.521
Are you going to talk about your boss?

01:01:19.772 --> 01:01:21.565
Yes.

01:01:21.691 --> 01:01:24.026
Yes, I'll talk about my boss.

01:01:24.193 --> 01:01:26.237
Your prophecy is invalid.

01:01:26.404 --> 01:01:27.822
His miracles are false.

01:01:27.947 --> 01:01:30.550
She is the one who made all his scars,
it is not your confession, my daughter.

01:01:30.574 --> 01:01:32.743
Did you come to blame someone else?

01:01:32.868 --> 01:01:35.955
I blame myself .. for the silence.

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.958
The thing is.

01:01:41.585 --> 01:01:43.212
Do you have any idea?

01:01:43.337 --> 01:01:46.632
The stigmata... on his head.

01:01:46.799 --> 01:01:48.759
He picked up a piece of broken glass.

01:01:48.884 --> 01:01:52.805
He rubbed his forehead until he bled.

01:01:53.931 --> 01:01:57.184
Have you seen that?

01:02:00.896 --> 01:02:03.774
Yes.

01:02:13.033 --> 01:02:15.119
Three.

01:02:15.244 --> 01:02:17.663
Yes?

01:02:17.788 --> 01:02:21.250
- Four.
- Yeah right.

01:02:23.669 --> 01:02:27.548
No. You're hitting the pen too hard.

01:02:29.467 --> 01:02:32.178
I ruined it.

01:02:32.511 --> 01:02:36.015
Can not.

01:03:47.002 --> 01:03:49.755
Come.

01:03:52.841 --> 01:03:55.678
Come.

01:04:59.199 --> 01:05:01.910
You want to see me?

01:05:02.077 --> 01:05:04.747
Show me

01:05:55.964 --> 01:05:59.384
deeper than that.
deeper.

01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:01.136
Can not.

01:06:01.261 --> 01:06:04.473
My fingers are short.

01:06:06.016 --> 01:06:09.228
you want to try?

01:06:33.961 --> 01:06:36.630
Oh God.

01:06:36.797 --> 01:06:39.550
Oh God.

01:06:43.971 --> 01:06:45.347
No.

01:06:45.472 --> 01:06:48.767
No. No.
No, no.

01:06:48.892 --> 01:06:49.893
- Yes.
- No.

01:06:50.018 --> 01:06:53.313
- No!
- Come on, tell the chills now!

01:06:53.522 --> 01:06:56.358
Tell her!

01:07:00.654 --> 01:07:03.865
I can not stop.

01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:11.039
Jesus.

01:07:28.432 --> 01:07:31.435
Do you want more?

01:08:27.741 --> 01:08:32.871
Today's reading will be from Leviticus.

01:08:33.455 --> 01:08:35.582
...but before we start

01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:40.879
I would like to ask a question that would
break the heart of one of our sisters.

01:08:41.046 --> 01:08:43.089
Sister Christina.

01:08:43.256 --> 01:08:46.384
If something bothers you...

01:08:46.551 --> 01:08:50.180
You have to express it.

01:08:50.346 --> 01:08:54.225
Do you want me to speak now?
Here?

01:08:54.392 --> 01:08:56.353
This is your right.

01:08:56.478 --> 01:09:00.816
Take the burden off your heart,
Come and speak.

01:09:08.323 --> 01:09:11.326
Let's talk.

01:09:19.834 --> 01:09:22.295
...the head of our nuns.

01:09:22.462 --> 01:09:24.256
Deceive us.

01:09:24.381 --> 01:09:26.091
He lied to us.

01:09:26.258 --> 01:09:28.426
My dear sister explains what is in you.

01:09:28.551 --> 01:09:33.139
Do you want to complain
about the main mother?

01:09:33.473 --> 01:09:35.684
...I only know that

01:09:35.809 --> 01:09:39.437
...what
What do you know, sister?

01:09:45.109 --> 01:09:47.612
Benedetta fooled everyone.

01:09:47.737 --> 01:09:50.282
She made her scar on her forehead.

01:09:50.448 --> 01:09:51.741
.. when you fell.

01:09:51.908 --> 01:09:55.078
The glass broke and he was hit with it.

01:09:55.203 --> 01:09:56.203
Saw that.

01:09:56.246 --> 01:09:58.248
Christina, dear sister,
what are you talking about?

01:09:58.373 --> 01:10:03.336
I'm sure the other marks on
his body were the same.

01:10:03.503 --> 01:10:05.714
Sister Christina,

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:07.340
Did you see that?

01:10:07.507 --> 01:10:10.677
How did our boss mother
cut herself with glass?

01:10:10.844 --> 01:10:12.804
- Is that what you mean?
- Yes.

01:10:12.929 --> 01:10:16.433
I told the main nuns.

01:10:22.397 --> 01:10:24.607
What did you say to her?

01:10:24.774 --> 01:10:26.985
What I have seen.

01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:30.530
What did Sister Benedetta do?

01:10:31.781 --> 01:10:37.245
Do you realize that
perjury is a mortal sin?

01:10:38.204 --> 01:10:41.499
I do not lie.

01:10:44.627 --> 01:10:46.713
Sister Felicita,

01:10:46.838 --> 01:10:49.549
Told him.

01:11:03.772 --> 01:11:08.735
Did Sister Cristina tell you
that she had seen Sister Benedetta?

01:11:08.902 --> 01:11:12.530
Rub his forehead with the glass?

01:11:13.573 --> 01:11:15.575
She was seriously suspicious.

01:11:15.742 --> 01:11:18.703
But did she see it?

01:11:19.537 --> 01:11:23.583
She came live!

01:11:23.708 --> 01:11:27.003
But was she present or not?

01:11:29.464 --> 01:11:32.050
No.

01:11:34.344 --> 01:11:37.430
She was not there.

01:11:42.102 --> 01:11:44.104
Lie!

01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:45.688
She doesn't believe in me!

01:11:45.855 --> 01:11:48.066
She is possessed by demons!

01:11:48.233 --> 01:11:50.109
We have to punish her!

01:11:50.276 --> 01:11:51.778
Whip!

01:11:51.903 --> 01:11:57.450
- She must spank herself!
- The devil must be expelled from this body!

01:11:58.409 --> 01:12:01.412
Take off your clothes!

01:12:14.801 --> 01:12:16.886
Cast out these demons.

01:12:17.011 --> 01:12:20.932
Hit yourself, my dear sister.

01:12:56.301 --> 01:12:58.970
Well.

01:13:00.305 --> 01:13:02.473
The rain stopped.

01:13:02.599 --> 01:13:05.852
I have a gift for you.

01:13:20.158 --> 01:13:24.287
It will be more useful than my fingers.
Do you want to try it?

01:13:26.497 --> 01:13:29.625
It could scratch.

01:13:30.209 --> 01:13:31.209
Actually.

01:13:31.294 --> 01:13:33.379
I'll fix it.

01:13:33.546 --> 01:13:36.716
Take off your clothes.

01:13:44.098 --> 01:13:45.933
You enjoyed it, right?

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:47.685
What did you hear?

01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:51.356
Watching Christina spank herself.

01:13:51.481 --> 01:13:53.691
Wrong No.

01:13:53.816 --> 01:13:56.903
This is something different.

01:13:59.030 --> 01:14:01.157
I was thinking of you.

01:14:01.324 --> 01:14:05.036
I thought how would you feel about it.

01:14:12.335 --> 01:14:15.296
We tried?

01:14:25.306 --> 01:14:28.017
Slightly.

01:14:34.232 --> 01:14:36.818
it hurt?

01:14:36.984 --> 01:14:39.821
Not well.

01:15:15.898 --> 01:15:18.901
There is light.

01:15:31.664 --> 01:15:32.874
Is a star?

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.127
Sinner.

01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:10.119
The comet is just above the monastery.

01:16:10.244 --> 01:16:13.331
- What does that mean?
- Indicates a warning from God.

01:16:13.497 --> 01:16:16.709
Something terrible is going to happen.

01:16:22.131 --> 01:16:25.301
No! No!

01:16:41.776 --> 01:16:44.654
"Christina"

01:17:32.493 --> 01:17:35.496
What have you done.

01:17:35.746 --> 01:17:37.081
What have you done

01:17:37.206 --> 01:17:41.377
...your silly little sister.

01:17:43.587 --> 01:17:47.383
Sister Felicita, I want to
put my hand on her to bless her soul.

01:17:47.508 --> 01:17:50.427
You... don't touch her.

01:17:50.594 --> 01:17:52.429
That is my duty.

01:17:52.555 --> 01:17:55.766
The soul of the suicide goes to hell.
I don't want that to happen.

01:17:55.933 --> 01:17:58.477
Put your hands away.

01:17:58.644 --> 01:18:01.814
One word from me and I
will save her from eternal fire.

01:18:01.981 --> 01:18:05.818
Shut up, you motherfucker!

01:18:07.111 --> 01:18:08.111
Let me!

01:18:08.154 --> 01:18:09.530
It's enough!

01:18:09.697 --> 01:18:12.491
Bitch!

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.035
Vile joke!

01:18:15.161 --> 01:18:17.913
Bitch!

01:19:18.349 --> 01:19:20.476
She ordered me to do it.

01:19:20.601 --> 01:19:25.064
I know she is no longer the head
of the nuns, but... where did she go?

01:19:25.856 --> 01:19:28.734
To Florence.

01:19:35.032 --> 01:19:37.117
Sister Felicita left.

01:19:37.284 --> 01:19:39.620
Went to Florence.

01:19:39.745 --> 01:19:42.915
Why did you do that?

01:19:43.749 --> 01:19:47.544
To speak to the head
of the monastery, I think.

01:19:49.129 --> 01:19:52.424
And what will you say?

01:19:54.885 --> 01:19:58.180
And what are you afraid of?

01:19:59.098 --> 01:20:01.892
Of everything.

01:20:02.267 --> 01:20:05.145
What do you mean?

01:20:05.729 --> 01:20:08.982
That the miracle is not real?

01:20:09.149 --> 01:20:12.111
I did not say that.

01:20:14.196 --> 01:20:16.740
..AND

01:20:16.907 --> 01:20:21.078
That I cut my forehead myself with a glass?

01:20:21.995 --> 01:20:25.457
That's exactly what you did, right?

01:20:25.707 --> 01:20:28.127
It is not like this?

01:20:28.252 --> 01:20:30.963
I do not know.

01:20:31.171 --> 01:20:34.258
I don't know how that happened.

01:20:34.425 --> 01:20:38.554
I only know that God
expresses His will through me.

01:20:40.431 --> 01:20:43.851
..not just my skin.

01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:48.272
But this too.

01:20:48.564 --> 01:20:49.606
For!

01:20:49.773 --> 01:20:53.152
You disgust me.

01:20:58.532 --> 01:21:01.785
Is that what scares you?

01:21:02.369 --> 01:21:04.997
What would Sister Felicita say about us?

01:21:05.122 --> 01:21:07.958
What we do?

01:21:14.173 --> 01:21:17.801
Do you think we should be ashamed?

01:21:19.595 --> 01:21:24.558
Shame does not exist
under the protection of God's love.

01:21:25.601 --> 01:21:27.686
God's Love.

01:21:27.811 --> 01:21:30.939
You love yourself.

01:21:34.610 --> 01:21:38.071
- Then come to me.
- No.

01:21:43.577 --> 01:21:46.496
Show me your chest.

01:21:47.831 --> 01:21:50.500
Please.

01:22:13.857 --> 01:22:16.360
Do not touch it.

01:22:16.526 --> 01:22:19.029
She is not guilty of anything.

01:22:19.196 --> 01:22:21.823
Benedetta.

01:22:38.048 --> 01:22:41.802
Maybe everything will be revealed.

01:23:42.904 --> 01:23:44.322
Where is Teresa?

01:23:44.489 --> 01:23:47.909
at the hospital.
It will not survive, Your Excellency.

01:23:48.034 --> 01:23:50.495
It probably won't.

01:23:50.662 --> 01:23:55.041
Three have died since Sunday.
But I am not afraid.

01:23:55.167 --> 01:23:59.087
This is because you are so vibrant.

01:23:59.254 --> 01:24:01.339
The baby will be born in a few weeks.

01:24:01.465 --> 01:24:04.843
Milk appeared earlier.

01:24:07.721 --> 01:24:10.599
Enough!

01:24:16.521 --> 01:24:18.982
Do you want to add something?

01:24:19.107 --> 01:24:20.358
I've told you everything.

01:24:20.484 --> 01:24:24.070
Now everything is in your hands.

01:24:25.238 --> 01:24:29.201
Big accusations require massive evidence

01:24:29.367 --> 01:24:31.494
I only told the truth.

01:24:31.661 --> 01:24:33.872
You can doubt my motives.

01:24:33.997 --> 01:24:35.624
But come to Pescia.

01:24:35.749 --> 01:24:39.044
You will see it with your own eyes.

01:24:41.171 --> 01:24:45.008
If your sight is true.

01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:53.391
If something is wrong with Pescia,
I can find out.

01:24:53.516 --> 01:24:58.396
And if that sister is really guilty of
blasphemy, then there is a fire waiting for her.

01:24:58.521 --> 01:25:03.026
...but if your testimony is false.

01:25:03.193 --> 01:25:05.487
What will they do to you?

01:25:05.654 --> 01:25:09.199
Do you know it well?

01:25:09.616 --> 01:25:12.452
Yes.

01:25:13.411 --> 01:25:16.164
He.

01:25:24.381 --> 01:25:26.758
Oh God!

01:25:26.883 --> 01:25:29.844
Jesus!

01:25:43.775 --> 01:25:46.653
Pray!

01:25:49.948 --> 01:25:52.033
Jesus!

01:25:52.158 --> 01:25:55.745
Have mercy on us sinners!

01:26:19.394 --> 01:26:22.188
This is a sign of God's justice.

01:26:22.313 --> 01:26:24.733
The third angel blows the trumpet.

01:26:24.858 --> 01:26:28.611
A great star fell from the sky,
burning like a torch.

01:26:28.778 --> 01:26:31.531
The epidemic will affect
a third of the entire Earth.

01:26:31.698 --> 01:26:33.116
It is an epidemic!

01:26:33.283 --> 01:26:35.452
It's the way to punish us!

01:26:35.618 --> 01:26:38.830
He sent a plague on sinners!

01:26:38.997 --> 01:26:41.249
O Spirit of Christ, sanctify me.

01:26:41.374 --> 01:26:43.418
O Body of Christ, save me.

01:26:43.585 --> 01:26:46.463
Oh blood of Christ intoxicating me.

01:26:46.588 --> 01:26:49.674
Oh water close to Christ, wash me!

01:26:49.841 --> 01:26:53.178
...passion of Christ.

01:27:20.455 --> 01:27:23.291
Thanks God.

01:27:23.416 --> 01:27:26.211
I appreciate it!

01:27:29.756 --> 01:27:32.133
do not worry.

01:27:32.258 --> 01:27:36.012
The comet is a sign
that God is protecting us!

01:27:36.179 --> 01:27:40.141
The plague will not infect Pescia!

01:27:40.558 --> 01:27:43.353
Jesus promised me.
I am his wife.

01:27:43.478 --> 01:27:45.021
The city will be saved!

01:27:45.188 --> 01:27:47.232
Lord Jesus, protect us!

01:27:47.398 --> 01:27:51.402
Protect us from the plague!

01:27:51.569 --> 01:27:55.198
Thank you Lord Jesus.

01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:58.785
My God Jesus.

01:27:58.910 --> 01:28:01.537
I knew you would save us.

01:28:01.663 --> 01:28:04.540
Thank my God.

01:28:12.298 --> 01:28:14.175
Close the city gates.

01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:17.971
Don't let anyone in or out.

01:28:18.972 --> 01:28:21.099
This is the Lord's will.

01:28:21.266 --> 01:28:24.310
Close the door now.

01:28:42.578 --> 01:28:45.206
Sister?

01:28:45.748 --> 01:28:48.751
What's up?

01:28:49.711 --> 01:28:52.130
"Benedetta"!

01:28:52.255 --> 01:28:55.049
"Benedetta"!

01:28:58.094 --> 01:29:01.514
Is the grave for you?

01:29:02.432 --> 01:29:05.309
Answer to me!

01:29:38.092 --> 01:29:40.094
It's a message! Fall from the sky.

01:29:40.261 --> 01:29:43.014
The end is near!

01:29:43.139 --> 01:29:46.184
Get ready, people!

01:29:46.350 --> 01:29:48.144
Everything is written here, read it!

01:29:48.311 --> 01:29:51.522
These are the words of God!

01:30:01.532 --> 01:30:04.327
Bishop, come up with a solution.

01:30:04.494 --> 01:30:06.829
You, Your Excellency, may die.

01:30:06.954 --> 01:30:10.208
Don't let me die like this,
go to the father of your diocese.

01:30:10.333 --> 01:30:12.335
He is the one who will take care of you.

01:30:12.502 --> 01:30:17.215
this is me!
I am the father in my diocese.

01:30:21.886 --> 01:30:24.764
TÃ³malo!

01:30:37.193 --> 01:30:39.862
Open the door to the bishop!

01:30:39.987 --> 01:30:41.781
The door will stay closed!

01:30:41.906 --> 01:30:44.951
No one will go in, no one will go out!

01:30:45.076 --> 01:30:47.370
I am an envoy from Florence, open the door!

01:30:47.495 --> 01:30:49.097
Even if you are
the pope, it doesn't matter.

01:30:49.121 --> 01:30:51.582
We will not open!
You are under my tutelage!

01:30:51.749 --> 01:30:53.334
Guardianship of the Church!

01:30:53.501 --> 01:30:55.962
We are here under
the tutelage of "Jesus" himself!

01:30:56.128 --> 01:30:59.215
The door will stay closed!

01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:08.057
Your excellence

01:31:08.182 --> 01:31:11.143
I am the abbot of Pescia

01:31:11.269 --> 01:31:13.646
I am Alfonso Gilioli,
the representative of the Pope!

01:31:13.771 --> 01:31:16.983
And I have to speak to
the abbot of the convent.

01:31:17.149 --> 01:31:23.781
Unfortunately, I regret to inform you that
Santa Benedetta passed away this morning.

01:31:24.865 --> 01:31:27.618
I'm sorry you came here.

01:31:27.743 --> 01:31:30.746
I'll stay with you at her funeral,
take me to her.

01:31:30.913 --> 01:31:33.499
Let's go.

01:31:34.166 --> 01:31:37.169
The procession must stay out of town!

01:31:37.336 --> 01:31:40.965
Those who enter will be
examined by our doctors.

01:31:41.090 --> 01:31:43.926
- Even you, Excellency.
- It was God who sent us.

01:31:44.093 --> 01:31:46.846
And it's not you who is going to stop us!

01:31:46.971 --> 01:31:49.849
Let's get in!

01:32:13.998 --> 01:32:17.126
To open. To open.

01:32:19.503 --> 01:32:23.424
It is a great honour to
welcome you, Excellency.

01:32:38.147 --> 01:32:41.567
- Did you choose a day like this for a show?
- No, Your Excellency.

01:32:41.734 --> 01:32:46.864
Before dying, he instructed the nuns to
celebrate their ascension to heaven to the Lord.

01:32:47.031 --> 01:32:50.451
- Is it another view of her?
- Yes, Your Excellency. Just like that.

01:32:50.576 --> 01:32:52.995
The coffin will carry nine rookies.

01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:56.499
...disguised as angels.

01:33:20.231 --> 01:33:22.149
The skin is clean.

01:33:22.274 --> 01:33:24.318
No sign of the plague.

01:33:24.443 --> 01:33:28.656
- How did that happen to her?
- Excellency, your passing was surprising.

01:33:28.781 --> 01:33:30.825
I'll prepare the burial.

01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:32.827
Do whatever it takes.

01:33:32.993 --> 01:33:35.621
You seem to have doubts.

01:33:35.788 --> 01:33:39.416
I never think I'm dead.

01:33:39.583 --> 01:33:42.711
That is so amazing.

01:33:53.847 --> 01:33:58.519
May the Holy Spirit be with you.

01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:04.858
...and God's mercy and compassion.

01:34:08.279 --> 01:34:10.781
Jesus, don't leave me!

01:34:10.906 --> 01:34:13.867
Do not let me go.

01:34:13.993 --> 01:34:17.496
I want to stay with you.

01:34:27.089 --> 01:34:29.967
I was in heaven, in peace and quiet.

01:34:30.092 --> 01:34:32.344
But they got me out of there.

01:34:32.511 --> 01:34:37.016
I was expelled like a child
coming out of its mother's womb.

01:34:37.474 --> 01:34:39.560
Jesus sent me here on earth.

01:34:39.685 --> 01:34:43.397
For what reason, mother?

01:34:43.897 --> 01:34:47.776
I have seen people who are about to die.

01:34:49.403 --> 01:34:53.991
I have seen all their souls and I have
shed many tears.

01:34:54.533 --> 01:34:58.037
You saw my soul too, I guess?

01:34:58.162 --> 01:35:00.873
Jesus sent me down here.

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:04.335
To save you from the plague
and what will come next,

01:35:04.501 --> 01:35:06.253
from the eternal fire of hell.

01:35:06.378 --> 01:35:09.757
Don't worry about
the eternal fire of hell, mother.

01:35:09.882 --> 01:35:14.428
Fire already awaits
you here, in this world.

01:35:14.553 --> 01:35:16.638
The black plague is coming to Pescia.

01:35:16.805 --> 01:35:21.226
I was at the city gate, disguised,
I saw crows singing and I saw the corpses.

01:35:21.393 --> 01:35:24.605
Rich, poor, women and children.

01:35:24.772 --> 01:35:26.857
And Jesus was there too.

01:35:27.024 --> 01:35:31.570
He promised me that as long as I am alive,
you will be alive too.

01:35:31.737 --> 01:35:38.744
You are officially charged
with blasphemy and sexual perversion.

01:35:38.952 --> 01:35:42.664
The procedures will start tomorrow.

01:36:06.146 --> 01:36:09.817
We haven't found anything, Excellency.

01:36:09.942 --> 01:36:11.443
Did you look everywhere?

01:36:11.568 --> 01:36:17.032
- Did you cut the bedding and pillows?
- Yes, Your Excellency. any.

01:36:17.199 --> 01:36:19.201
Is so big.

01:36:19.326 --> 01:36:23.288
It must be somewhere.
Look again.

01:36:24.039 --> 01:36:25.541
What will you tell them?

01:36:25.707 --> 01:36:27.751
The Truth, what else?

01:36:27.918 --> 01:36:31.088
You can say something else.

01:36:38.679 --> 01:36:42.349
Apprentice BartolomÃ©a.
Stand up.

01:36:44.059 --> 01:36:46.812
Stand up.

01:36:50.190 --> 01:36:51.233
Well.

01:36:51.358 --> 01:36:52.693
Sister Felicita...

01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:55.988
Tell us what you have seen

01:36:56.113 --> 01:36:58.490
I have no words to describe this act.

01:36:58.615 --> 01:37:01.493
Please try it.

01:37:03.370 --> 01:37:06.748
I saw this girl naked with nothing.

01:37:06.915 --> 01:37:09.835
With the mother director, Benedetta.

01:37:10.002 --> 01:37:13.547
Can you be more precise, sister?

01:37:13.714 --> 01:37:17.009
They served each other

01:37:17.134 --> 01:37:19.386
...each in their turn

01:37:19.553 --> 01:37:22.347
like a man with a woman.

01:37:22.514 --> 01:37:26.393
How did you see these actions?

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:31.064
Through a hole, I did it myself.
On the wall of my old room.

01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:33.525
And that? Isn't it a mortal sin?

01:37:33.692 --> 01:37:38.071
- Spying on the nuns?
- Today we do not judge the ex-nuns.

01:37:38.196 --> 01:37:40.073
We have to do it.

01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:43.201
Who knows if his words
weren't dictated by jealousy?

01:37:43.368 --> 01:37:46.622
Also, Sister Felicita's testimony
is just the beginning.

01:37:46.788 --> 01:37:48.206
and not the last.

01:37:48.373 --> 01:37:50.542
Bartholomew.

01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:53.712
How do you respond to
Sister Felicita's accusation?

01:37:53.837 --> 01:37:56.923
This is the truth?

01:37:57.758 --> 01:37:58.758
Excuse me!

01:37:58.884 --> 01:38:01.428
I don't understand what he was saying.

01:38:01.553 --> 01:38:04.890
Have you looked lustfully
at Archpriest Benedetta?

01:38:05.015 --> 01:38:07.934
lust? between one woman and another?
this is not possible.

01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:12.272
The limits of what is possible
in this monastery are very wide.

01:38:12.439 --> 01:38:13.940
"BartolomÃ©a"

01:38:14.107 --> 01:38:20.322
Have you looked lustfully
at Archpriest Benedetta?

01:38:22.532 --> 01:38:25.410
But with love.

01:38:26.161 --> 01:38:30.290
Everything I have towards the top.
The nuns Benedetta is love.

01:38:30.415 --> 01:38:33.043
I feel the same for all the sisters.

01:38:33.168 --> 01:38:35.587
But you did not express this love.

01:38:35.712 --> 01:38:38.465
With the rest of
the sisters like this, right?

01:38:38.590 --> 01:38:41.009
No.

01:38:41.176 --> 01:38:46.348
Sister Felicita, in what way
this apprentice BartolomÃ©a...

01:38:46.515 --> 01:38:50.977
Expressing your love for the main mother?

01:38:52.687 --> 01:38:58.068
He used a small
wooden statue of the Virgin.

01:38:58.193 --> 01:39:04.241
Penetrating .. in Benedetta's genitals
and giving her an orgasm.

01:39:04.449 --> 01:39:07.202
An unheard of crime.

01:39:07.369 --> 01:39:10.622
It is blasphemy that
distorts the order of things.

01:39:10.747 --> 01:39:15.168
It is an abomination that
deserves the death penalty.

01:39:15.335 --> 01:39:16.628
So bad!

01:39:16.753 --> 01:39:20.757
This is not true.
This is not true.

01:39:23.135 --> 01:39:27.472
You can still save your soul, my daughter.

01:39:27.639 --> 01:39:30.559
If you confess.

01:39:35.814 --> 01:39:39.901
I have nothing to confess, Your Excellency.

01:39:49.536 --> 01:39:52.014
If you know everything that happened,
why do you need my confession?

01:39:52.038 --> 01:39:53.999
Your confession will alleviate your guilt.

01:39:54.165 --> 01:39:58.587
You can still avoid.
Burning and 'Benedetta' too.

01:40:17.397 --> 01:40:19.983
No.

01:40:24.613 --> 01:40:27.616
Strip her of her clothes.

01:40:57.103 --> 01:41:01.483
You can save your soul if you speak.

01:41:02.859 --> 01:41:05.779
Well.

01:41:08.657 --> 01:41:10.075
I admit it.

01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:13.244
I had terrible ideas...

01:41:13.370 --> 01:41:16.581
I hate Sister Juliana and wish her death.

01:41:16.748 --> 01:41:20.585
Now let me go!

01:41:23.671 --> 01:41:25.215
..My little girl.

01:41:25.382 --> 01:41:29.177
This is not what we want to hear from you.

01:41:42.857 --> 01:41:46.027
..for suffering.

01:41:47.487 --> 01:41:52.033
Have you seen something like this before?

01:41:54.369 --> 01:41:57.163
Joan of Arc was a brave warrior.

01:41:57.288 --> 01:42:00.250
But they gave him this.

01:42:00.375 --> 01:42:06.631
And then... he confessed all his
sins when he saw these tools.

01:42:07.424 --> 01:42:11.302
Don't pretend to be
braver than Joan of Arc.

01:42:11.469 --> 01:42:14.764
You don't need to pretend anything.

01:42:14.931 --> 01:42:17.684
I already confessed it to you.

01:42:17.809 --> 01:42:23.815
I told you I wanted to kill Sister Juliana.
I am guilty of murder.

01:42:24.357 --> 01:42:27.277
be merciful.

01:42:40.832 --> 01:42:44.377
I confessed it to you!

01:42:48.590 --> 01:42:50.717
You and I haven't met yet.

01:42:50.842 --> 01:42:53.720
But we are in the same boat.

01:42:53.887 --> 01:42:55.847
The journey can be long.

01:42:55.972 --> 01:42:58.141
or abbreviated.

01:42:58.308 --> 01:43:01.102
Let's pray that God illuminates our path.

01:43:01.227 --> 01:43:05.106
No! No! No! No! No!

01:43:57.200 --> 01:44:00.036
Sign in.

01:44:09.337 --> 01:44:13.174
What is love in your opinion?

01:44:17.345 --> 01:44:22.767
I guess love is not being alone.

01:44:23.476 --> 01:44:28.022
What is it. Feel hot in here.

01:44:30.608 --> 01:44:33.653
Does your leg hurt?

01:44:44.163 --> 01:44:48.918
Are you a leading nun
and want to wash my feet?

01:44:49.252 --> 01:44:52.922
As a beginner,
I washed it more than the others.

01:44:54.841 --> 01:44:57.927
Have you never touched a man?

01:44:58.094 --> 01:44:59.220
No.

01:44:59.387 --> 01:45:04.559
that's unfortunate. Because you are very
sensitive to the natural desires of women.

01:45:04.725 --> 01:45:08.062
I don't want anyone but god.

01:45:17.989 --> 01:45:20.074
Are you trying to seduce me?

01:45:20.199 --> 01:45:22.577
Where does that talent for
prostitution come from in you?

01:45:22.743 --> 01:45:25.079
I don't know what prostitutes have!

01:45:25.204 --> 01:45:29.292
And I don't ask you
how you know her either.

01:45:45.391 --> 01:45:48.269
Playing with me is playing with fire.

01:45:48.436 --> 01:45:50.563
Literally.

01:45:50.688 --> 01:45:52.857
I'm not afraid.

01:45:52.982 --> 01:45:55.276
Naturally.

01:45:55.401 --> 01:45:58.696
Can you imagine yourself
at the head of an army of light?

01:45:58.821 --> 01:46:01.407
Love is the only army I need.

01:46:01.532 --> 01:46:04.202
Love for Christ?
Is this what you mean?

01:46:04.368 --> 01:46:08.080
Or the love of "BartolomÃ©a"?

01:46:08.289 --> 01:46:11.209
And for BartolomÃ©a too.

01:46:11.375 --> 01:46:14.879
Does Jesus have to share it?

01:46:15.504 --> 01:46:17.882
He gladly shares everything.

01:46:18.007 --> 01:46:21.177
With all the peoples of the earth.

01:46:21.594 --> 01:46:24.555
What we are talking about is here.

01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:27.141
This is not love for all humanity.

01:46:27.308 --> 01:46:30.269
This is something more special, right?

01:46:30.436 --> 01:46:32.980
La BartolomÃ©a is something special.

01:46:33.147 --> 01:46:37.109
And through her I show
my love to the universe.

01:46:37.693 --> 01:46:43.157
And the universe once cut you
with a little piece of wood, didn't it?

01:46:56.462 --> 01:46:58.756
Show them the figurine!

01:46:58.881 --> 01:47:00.967
Bartholomew.

01:47:01.133 --> 01:47:04.512
I told them you made a mistake.

01:47:04.762 --> 01:47:08.599
You forced me to sin.

01:47:08.933 --> 01:47:10.893
How do you get a lie like
that out of your mouth?

01:47:10.935 --> 01:47:13.020
I will not suffer for you!

01:47:13.187 --> 01:47:17.817
- Go to hell!
- She's ready to confess!

01:47:26.242 --> 01:47:29.995
There is.
It's the statue.

01:47:43.926 --> 01:47:48.180
This is your love, Benedetta.

01:47:52.601 --> 01:47:54.729
Rowing!

01:47:54.854 --> 01:47:57.815
Rowing! How dare you?

01:47:57.982 --> 01:48:01.152
How do you deal with my wife like that?
You will be responsible!

01:48:01.277 --> 01:48:02.528
You are despicable!

01:48:02.695 --> 01:48:04.780
You all will be judged

01:48:04.905 --> 01:48:07.324
you all! O followers of Satan!

01:48:07.450 --> 01:48:09.076
Stop judging!

01:48:09.243 --> 01:48:16.000
You will beg me for mercy!
You will die in hellish torment!

01:48:45.321 --> 01:48:46.489
When this happened?

01:48:46.614 --> 01:48:49.116
Apparently, when he got here, he's
probably going to die.

01:48:49.283 --> 01:48:51.994
Let her stay in the basement, no visitors.

01:48:52.161 --> 01:48:54.163
No one should get out of here.

01:48:54.288 --> 01:48:57.917
And burn everything you touched.

01:49:29.865 --> 01:49:33.244
Everything will be fine.

01:49:33.369 --> 01:49:37.331
I learned a thing or two
when I was a prostitute.

01:49:37.456 --> 01:49:41.252
Humiliation leaves no scars.

01:50:18.455 --> 01:50:20.708
Catch her! Catch her! Catch her!

01:50:20.833 --> 01:50:24.086
Catch her!

01:50:28.257 --> 01:50:31.301
The people of Pescia will not allow
those you have protected to be burned.

01:50:31.468 --> 01:50:35.556
Alhab decides nothing, but
the church decides. the church decided.

01:50:35.681 --> 01:50:37.516
- Firm.
- No...

01:50:37.683 --> 01:50:39.661
I remind you that the girl
was sent to serve the Lord.

01:50:39.685 --> 01:50:44.606
Dad. Consider your homework completed.

01:50:45.190 --> 01:50:47.609
It is not about mercy or love.

01:50:47.735 --> 01:50:51.613
Compassion and love
have nothing to do with duty.

01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:56.326
So, do your thing.

01:51:16.805 --> 01:51:19.725
- Your excellence?
- Yes?

01:51:19.850 --> 01:51:22.728
Sister Benedetta has a request for you.

01:51:22.895 --> 01:51:25.814
He wants to be allowed to pray
with Sister Felicita.

01:51:25.939 --> 01:51:29.359
And ask for forgiveness.

01:51:29.568 --> 01:51:31.528
.. as she wanted too.

01:51:31.695 --> 01:51:33.906
to take her to the plaza.

01:51:34.031 --> 01:51:38.869
...on a donkey,
as when Christ entered Jerusalem.

01:51:41.246 --> 01:51:43.790
on a donkey. Of course, no.

01:51:43.916 --> 01:51:47.544
But I'll let her do her
Congratulations comic.

01:51:47.711 --> 01:51:52.466
After all, we have to
play our roles, right?

01:51:52.883 --> 01:51:55.594
Well.

01:52:04.895 --> 01:52:07.731
You can go.

01:52:18.784 --> 01:52:23.163
You have to be careful, I'm dying.

01:52:23.705 --> 01:52:27.709
I want to tell you what
Jesus revealed to me.

01:52:28.835 --> 01:52:31.129
Your daughter is
waiting for you to join her.

01:52:31.255 --> 01:52:34.549
I do not believe this.

01:52:35.133 --> 01:52:39.554
She is burning in hell,
I always knew.

01:52:42.766 --> 01:52:47.062
You gave your life to God
without believing in him.

01:52:47.187 --> 01:52:49.481
Now it will give you rest.

01:52:49.606 --> 01:52:51.358
And reward your work.

01:52:51.483 --> 01:52:55.445
You will feel his love inside of you.

01:52:57.572 --> 01:53:01.368
God never spoke to me
the way you spoke to me.

01:53:01.535 --> 01:53:04.454
He's talking to you now.

01:53:04.579 --> 01:53:08.125
It speaks to you through your pain.

01:53:11.628 --> 01:53:14.923
So talk a lot!

01:53:16.174 --> 01:53:19.720
But I don't understand anything you say.

01:53:22.848 --> 01:53:25.142
Which is the?

01:53:25.308 --> 01:53:28.770
What did he tell you?

01:53:29.438 --> 01:53:31.940
Do you think I know?

01:53:32.107 --> 01:53:35.068
May be.

01:53:35.318 --> 01:53:38.113
If you know.

01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:40.907
Yes.

01:53:43.869 --> 01:53:46.580
Tell me.

01:53:47.497 --> 01:53:50.333
Tell me.

01:53:51.585 --> 01:53:54.463
Tell me.

01:54:07.559 --> 01:54:09.853
"Benedetta"!

01:54:09.978 --> 01:54:11.313
"Benedetta"!

01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:15.108
Benedetta, forgive me!

01:54:15.275 --> 01:54:16.902
"Benedetta"!

01:54:17.068 --> 01:54:19.321
Benedetta, look at me!

01:54:19.488 --> 01:54:21.823
Please forgive me.

01:54:21.990 --> 01:54:24.868
Tell me you don't hate me.

01:54:25.035 --> 01:54:29.372
Well.
I had to be betrayed.

01:55:03.198 --> 01:55:06.034
Let me!

01:55:12.207 --> 01:55:14.918
I will show you the kindness
that will make you congratulate me.

01:55:15.043 --> 01:55:16.795
You will not suffer from the fire.

01:55:16.962 --> 01:55:20.465
But you have to admit it all.

01:55:22.217 --> 01:55:25.220
Let go of your lies.

01:55:25.345 --> 01:55:28.181
To confess!

01:55:33.562 --> 01:55:36.481
I will admit it.

01:55:39.234 --> 01:55:41.903
You say.

01:55:49.202 --> 01:55:52.497
Alas, miserable Pescia!

01:55:52.664 --> 01:55:55.542
I couldn't protect you.

01:55:55.709 --> 01:55:59.212
I could not protect you from evil.

01:56:08.596 --> 01:56:12.267
They betrayed my love!

01:56:12.392 --> 01:56:15.603
Now none of you will be safe!

01:56:15.729 --> 01:56:17.689
Death will come to this city.

01:56:17.856 --> 01:56:21.985
Like the wind that carries
everything in its path.

01:56:25.572 --> 01:56:27.949
Sight!

01:56:28.074 --> 01:56:29.534
..Angel of Death.

01:56:29.701 --> 01:56:32.162
It has come closer.

01:56:32.287 --> 01:56:34.539
Death is here!

01:56:34.706 --> 01:56:38.877
He already walks among you.

01:56:39.252 --> 01:56:41.713
Angel of Death!

01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:44.966
Show me your face.

01:56:57.437 --> 01:56:59.981
He's the one who did this to me.

01:57:00.106 --> 01:57:02.650
The bishop!

01:57:02.776 --> 01:57:05.820
He is the one who brought
the plague to Pescia.

01:57:05.987 --> 01:57:07.405
For you.

01:57:07.530 --> 01:57:10.200
To his children! To the fire!

01:57:10.325 --> 01:57:12.285
To the fire.

01:57:12.410 --> 01:57:14.287
Take it to the fire.

01:57:14.454 --> 01:57:17.916
To the fire.

01:57:28.468 --> 01:57:32.597
No! If you die, you will die too.

01:57:32.764 --> 01:57:36.851
It is the bishop who must die!

01:57:36.976 --> 01:57:41.064
This bishop is the one you have to burn!

01:58:20.853 --> 01:58:25.942
Untie it! untie it!

01:58:37.579 --> 01:58:40.206
Came back!

01:58:51.759 --> 01:58:54.804
This is the kiss of peace!

01:59:39.015 --> 01:59:42.185
Do not be afraid.

02:00:11.089 --> 02:00:14.592
Do you want me to bless your soul?

02:00:16.135 --> 02:00:18.471
.. when you were dead.

02:00:18.596 --> 02:00:20.681
Have you seen another world?

02:00:20.848 --> 02:00:25.978
Jesus showed me everyone's place,
past, present and future.

02:00:26.104 --> 02:00:28.189
Why?

02:00:28.356 --> 02:00:32.235
Will I go to heaven or hell?

02:00:33.152 --> 02:00:35.988
To heaven.

02:00:38.866 --> 02:00:42.495
You lie to the end.

02:02:16.172 --> 02:02:18.174
What are you doing?

02:02:18.299 --> 02:02:21.302
I'll be back there.

02:02:24.096 --> 02:02:27.308
But there is nothing left there.

02:02:27.475 --> 02:02:29.060
Why will you come back?

02:02:29.185 --> 02:02:32.104
The monastery is my home and I want to
spend the rest of my life there.

02:02:32.271 --> 02:02:35.107
It is a thing of the past.

02:02:35.232 --> 02:02:38.194
Not for me.

02:02:40.029 --> 02:02:42.073
We're going somewhere now.

02:02:42.239 --> 02:02:44.200
- Do you believe that?
- Yes! anywhere.

02:02:44.367 --> 02:02:47.661
We can go to Rome, Venice or Spain.

02:02:47.787 --> 02:02:49.705
How are we going to eat?

02:02:49.830 --> 02:02:51.248
Are we going to steal?

02:02:51.415 --> 02:02:54.210
Or will we sell ourselves?

02:02:55.795 --> 02:02:59.507
Things may be worse,
but we will survive.

02:02:59.632 --> 02:03:04.011
If you come back, they
will take you back to the fire.

02:03:04.178 --> 02:03:06.305
They won't burn me anymore.

02:03:06.472 --> 02:03:09.975
Yes.
I will be protected.

02:03:10.142 --> 02:03:13.646
of which?
Who is your husband, Jesus?

02:03:13.771 --> 02:03:16.065
Still don't believe me?

02:03:16.232 --> 02:03:20.069
- After everything you've seen?
- Sight.

02:03:25.533 --> 02:03:29.787
- ...I already explained how it happened!
- Stop the hypocrisy! We are alone.

02:03:29.912 --> 02:03:32.414
You can admit that these
scars were your own invention.

02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:35.167
Dilo.

02:03:35.793 --> 02:03:38.587
Dilo.

02:03:43.175 --> 02:03:46.720
If you love me, say so.

02:03:48.973 --> 02:03:51.892
Say it,
why do you say such terrible things?

02:03:52.017 --> 02:03:55.521
Because I don't want you to die.

02:03:57.106 --> 02:04:01.569
Those who were with you yesterday will
be the first to throw you into the fire.

02:04:06.156 --> 02:04:08.868
You're right.

02:04:09.577 --> 02:04:12.162
They will tie me up.

02:04:12.288 --> 02:04:15.249
...and they will set fire.

02:04:15.416 --> 02:04:19.086
The flame will touch
me, but it won't burn me!

02:04:19.211 --> 02:04:22.047
God will not allow that to happen.

02:04:22.214 --> 02:04:24.466
and everyone will see it.

02:04:24.592 --> 02:04:27.636
No one will ever question me, not even you.

02:04:27.761 --> 02:04:30.347
You will not doubt or
be afraid of anything.

02:04:30.472 --> 02:04:33.809
This will be my gift to you.

02:04:34.852 --> 02:04:36.103
You are crazy!

02:04:36.270 --> 02:04:39.023
You are crazy!

02:04:40.107 --> 02:04:42.318
You're just a girl, BartolomÃ©a.

02:04:42.484 --> 02:04:45.654
This is part of your magic.

02:04:53.245 --> 02:04:55.623
Go away!

02:04:55.789 --> 02:04:57.916
Then go.

02:04:58.083 --> 02:05:01.420
Go to hell!

02:05:01.670 --> 02:05:04.882
You will burn!

02:05:06.008 --> 02:05:09.094
Go away!

02:05:33.243 --> 02:05:37.748
Sister Benedetta Carlini's
testimony was rejected.

02:05:37.915 --> 02:05:43.337
She lived until she was seventy years old,
isolated in the monastery complex.

02:05:43.462 --> 02:05:46.965
You can attend mass, and sometimes...

02:05:47.132 --> 02:05:53.389
...She was allowed to dine with
her sisters, but sitting on the floor.

02:05:53.555 --> 02:06:00.813
for the plague that ravaged the country,
far from the city of Pescia
