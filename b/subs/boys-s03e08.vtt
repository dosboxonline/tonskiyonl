13:29.142 --> 13:31.353
'Cause if you did want
to say that,

13:31.436 --> 13:33.230
I mean, you could.

13:36.358 --> 13:37.400
What happened?

13:37.484 --> 13:39.152
Uh... Butcher.

13:39.236 --> 13:41.196
Just out of nowhere,
knocked me out.

13:41.279 --> 13:43.281
Did he tell you?

13:43.365 --> 13:45.492
Tell me what?

13:45.575 --> 13:47.827
That Temp V is fatal.

13:49.037 --> 13:52.123
If you shot up any more, you'd
probably be dead right now.

13:52.207 --> 13:54.501
Oh, my fucking God,
he didn't tell you!

13:54.584 --> 13:56.503
- That asshole!
- Saved my life.

13:56.586 --> 13:58.463
Saved your life?

13:58.547 --> 14:00.715
It looks like he gave you
a concussion.

14:00.799 --> 14:03.093
He stopped me
from taking more V.

14:06.263 --> 14:08.765
H-Have you ever had Pizza Rolls?

14:11.309 --> 14:13.603
Like... middle school sleepover

14:13.687 --> 14:15.188
Pizza Rolls?

14:15.272 --> 14:18.900
Yeah, Dad bought them in bulk
after Mom left.

14:18.984 --> 14:21.111
Every night,
we'd have Pizza Rolls,

14:21.194 --> 14:23.488
watch Remington Steele...

14:23.572 --> 14:26.074
try not to touch
her spot on the couch.

14:26.157 --> 14:29.035
And he never fought back
for her or anything.

14:29.119 --> 14:32.038
Just sat there
eating Pizza Rolls.

14:32.122 --> 14:35.125
I spent so much time
thinking he was...

14:35.208 --> 14:37.294
sad and-and weak.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.129
Just a loser.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.923
But you know what? Dad...

14:42.007 --> 14:44.217
was there.

14:44.301 --> 14:46.469
Taking care of me
during-during the worst days

14:46.553 --> 14:48.346
of his life, just trying
to keep the lights on

14:48.430 --> 14:50.181
and a... [scoffs]

14:50.265 --> 14:51.850
...and a roof above our heads.

14:54.311 --> 14:56.313
He wasn't weak.

14:58.273 --> 15:00.609
I just, I-I didn't know

15:00.692 --> 15:03.069
what strength was.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.906
Annie, I'm-I'm so sorry.

15:06.990 --> 15:09.367
I've been an asshole.

15:09.451 --> 15:11.411
I never should have...

15:11.494 --> 15:13.663
I-I never should've put
any of this onto you.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.585
Thank you for saying that.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.674
Literally every neuron
in your brain

15:24.758 --> 15:26.676
is screaming "I told you so,"
so why don't you just say it

15:26.760 --> 15:28.470
- before your head explodes.
- Oh, my God!

15:28.553 --> 15:32.265
- I fucking told you so.
- Feel good to get that out?

15:32.349 --> 15:34.059
- So satisfying. Oh, my God.
- [phone ringing]

15:37.771 --> 15:39.481
Hello?

15:39.564 --> 15:42.400
Oh, my God, where are you?

15:42.484 --> 15:44.319
[sighs]

15:44.402 --> 15:46.404
[indistinct chatter on TV]

15:48.740 --> 15:51.117
[door opens]

15:53.119 --> 15:55.246
Hey.

15:55.330 --> 15:56.915
[Hughie] Hey, Maeve.

15:56.998 --> 15:58.500
Good to see you again.

15:58.583 --> 15:59.668
Glad you're okay.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.461
It's like you wear a neon sign

16:01.544 --> 16:03.463
that says,
"Raw dog me, I'm a bottom."

16:03.546 --> 16:06.174
- I'm gonna, I'm gonna
let you two catch up.
- Me, too.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.262
Where were you?

16:11.346 --> 16:14.349
About 12 floors
below you in the Tower

16:14.432 --> 16:16.810
- this whole time.
- How did you get out?

16:16.893 --> 16:18.812
Your #FreeMaeve shit

16:18.895 --> 16:21.314
had every LGB-teen in the world

16:21.398 --> 16:23.817
up Vought's ass.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.652
You got me my chance.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.613
You know what would've
been better, though?

16:28.697 --> 16:31.032
Actually busting me out.

16:31.116 --> 16:32.909
I think that would've been
way harder.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.911
[inhaling deeply]

16:37.997 --> 16:40.709
Merde! That hurt.

16:40.792 --> 16:44.879
You've been drowning yourself in this shit

16:44.963 --> 16:45.964
since Little Nina.

16:46.047 --> 16:47.090
I have done my part.

16:47.173 --> 16:50.218
-We're not finished, asshole.
-Yeah, I am.

16:50.301 --> 16:53.805
-Asshole!
-Nina was right.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.932
My papa, he put
a chain around my neck.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.559
And all that fucking changes

16:57.642 --> 16:59.269
is who holds the other end.

17:05.483 --> 17:10.655
Our past is not who we are.

17:10.739 --> 17:13.908
I thought I'd always be broken.

17:14.993 --> 17:19.622
But you saw something in me.

17:23.877 --> 17:26.504
I see it in you.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.883
What do you see?

17:29.966 --> 17:34.220
I see mon coeur.

17:37.307 --> 17:40.059
Soldier Boy is Homelander's
fucking what?

17:40.143 --> 17:41.686
Homelander's father.

17:41.770 --> 17:43.354
Biologically, at least.

17:43.438 --> 17:45.273
[sighs] So put them
in a room together,

17:45.356 --> 17:48.067
- are they gonna fight
or fucking hug?
- We don't know.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.069
Soldier Boy's been, uh, weird.

17:50.153 --> 17:51.821
- But Butcher...
- [Mother's Milk] If there's
a snowball's chance

17:51.905 --> 17:55.033
that Butcher can take down
Homelander, he's gonna take it.

17:55.116 --> 17:57.535
I don't care what
your orders are, I'm Starlight,

17:57.619 --> 18:01.164
and I'm telling you that you
need to evacuate the Tower now.

18:01.247 --> 18:04.125
Because Soldier Boy is
alive and he's real,

18:04.209 --> 18:07.378
and he's gonna f... oh, fucking,
you fucking stupid...

18:07.462 --> 18:08.963
Fuck.

18:09.047 --> 18:12.133
There are a couple thousand
people in that building.

18:13.384 --> 18:15.178
I mean, if he pulls a Herogasm,

18:15.261 --> 18:17.096
he's gonna take
the whole fucking place down.

18:17.180 --> 18:20.433
Then we take down Soldier Boy
before he gets to Homelander.

18:20.517 --> 18:22.852
And save Butcher.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.065
Y'all two fuck us over,

18:27.148 --> 18:29.067
and now you want to be
Motherfucking Theresa?

18:29.150 --> 18:30.819
I know.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.320
- And-and I'm sorry...
- [Starlight] Hughie.

18:32.403 --> 18:33.947
Some people are
just past saving.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.031
He don't want to be saved.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.032
[Hughie] He could've dragged me

18:36.115 --> 18:37.033
down with him,
but he didn't.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.993
There's still something good.

18:39.077 --> 18:41.037
Deep, deep...

18:42.831 --> 18:44.707
- ...deep inside.
- [Frenchie] Balls deep.

18:46.209 --> 18:48.294
Perhaps.

18:48.378 --> 18:49.462
Bonjour, Petit Hughie.

18:49.546 --> 18:50.880
We save everyone.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.258
Even if they don't deserve it.

18:53.341 --> 18:56.010
Especially
if they don't deserve it.

19:03.726 --> 19:06.646
Whoa... that brings me back.

19:08.356 --> 19:10.275
Used to sneak
my dad's Manhattans

19:10.358 --> 19:11.818
when I was a kid.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.862
[Butcher] I didn't have
to nick nothin' from my old man.

19:13.945 --> 19:15.446
He used to get me
and me little brother

19:15.530 --> 19:17.949
lagered just for the hell of it.

19:18.032 --> 19:20.076
Well, I got to admit,
that does sound funny.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.120
[chuckles]

19:22.203 --> 19:24.581
- The old man still around?
- [Butcher] Arse cancer.

19:24.664 --> 19:25.915
[phone buzzing]

19:25.999 --> 19:29.043
Shitting his guts out
as we speak, one hopes.

19:32.255 --> 19:34.841
You ever see
The Soldier Boy Story?

19:34.924 --> 19:37.010
- Must've missed it.
- It's a classic.

19:37.093 --> 19:39.846
We lost Best Picture to
An American in Paris that year.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.474
At least I got to ass-fuck
Jane Wyman in the coat check.

19:44.475 --> 19:47.520
About a poor kid from
the streets of South Philly.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.607
Discovers he's got

19:50.690 --> 19:52.984
incredible powers
to match his...

19:53.067 --> 19:55.069
heart of gold.

19:56.070 --> 19:57.739
It's all bullshit.

19:57.822 --> 19:59.574
Blimey, you don't say?

19:59.657 --> 20:02.410
Actually my father owned half
the steel mills in the state.

20:02.493 --> 20:04.579
I went to boarding school.

20:04.662 --> 20:07.040
Got kicked out
of boarding school.

20:07.123 --> 20:09.417
Because I was a fuck-up.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.421
But he made sure I knew it.

20:13.504 --> 20:14.797
Use the belt, did he?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.341
[Soldier Boy] Never laid
a hand on me.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.426
He couldn't be bothered.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.263
Said I was a disappointment.

20:23.806 --> 20:25.808
Not good enough
to carry his name.

20:28.311 --> 20:31.272
So I went to his golf buddies
in the War Department,

20:31.356 --> 20:33.149
and they get me
into Dr. Vought's

20:33.232 --> 20:35.068
Compound V trials.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.778
I became a superhero.

20:36.861 --> 20:39.280
Strongest man alive.
Fucking ticker tape parades

20:39.364 --> 20:40.657
when I came home.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.450
And what did
the old man say then?

20:42.533 --> 20:44.535
Ah.

20:48.331 --> 20:50.541
He said I took a shortcut.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.715
That a real man
wouldn't have cheated.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.849
Mm.
[clears throat]

21:06.933 --> 21:08.935
What about you, you got kids?

21:09.018 --> 21:10.937
It's complicated.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.481
I always assumed
I had a few out there.

21:13.564 --> 21:15.566
Somewhere.

21:18.027 --> 21:19.988
I always wanted 'em.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.659
'Cause I thought I could do it
better than my father did.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.995
Homelander ain't yours.

21:27.078 --> 21:28.705
Not really.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.624
- He's the only blood
I've got left.
- It don't matter.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.876
You didn't name him,
didn't raise him.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.878
Vought grew him

21:35.962 --> 21:38.256
in a fucking test tube
to take your place.

21:38.339 --> 21:41.759
He's the fucking reason they
left you to rot with the Ivans.

21:41.843 --> 21:43.928
Look, mate.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.975
We had a deal.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.653
[clucks tongue]

22:02.196 --> 22:03.781
I'm gonna get some air.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.497
[metal clanging]

22:17.462 --> 22:20.465
[Homelander] Sharpen it
for a thousand hours,

22:20.548 --> 22:22.633
still won't cut
Soldier Boy's skin.

22:28.848 --> 22:31.517
So... you were on his team.

22:31.601 --> 22:33.352
You knew him.

22:34.604 --> 22:36.856
What was he like?

22:42.195 --> 22:43.946
[exhales]
Come on.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.656
Nobody's all bad.

22:47.950 --> 22:49.535
[marker clatters]

22:52.705 --> 22:54.832
He's my father.

22:54.916 --> 22:56.918
I didn't believe him at first.

22:57.001 --> 22:59.128
I ripped apart
the company archives,

22:59.212 --> 23:01.130
and... it's true.

23:01.214 --> 23:03.382
[laughs]

23:03.466 --> 23:05.468
It's true.

23:07.512 --> 23:09.847
They lied to me my whole life.

23:11.224 --> 23:13.226
Surprise.

23:14.685 --> 23:17.688
Thing I needed most as a kid
and they kept it from me.

23:21.150 --> 23:23.152
Now, well, I...

23:26.155 --> 23:28.074
I'm not sure I want to.

23:29.951 --> 23:32.829
It's funny, you know, everyone
thinks of you as this, uh...

23:32.912 --> 23:35.540
unreadable sphinx.

23:35.623 --> 23:38.209
A mystery.
[laughs]

23:38.292 --> 23:40.253
Not me. I see through

23:40.336 --> 23:42.713
that mask.

23:42.797 --> 23:45.133
I mean, literally,
I can see your face.

23:45.216 --> 23:47.135
Your battle scars.

23:47.218 --> 23:49.804
The crooked old smile of yours.

23:49.887 --> 23:52.265
I know when you're happy,

23:52.348 --> 23:55.017
sad, telling the truth.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.311
Lying.

23:59.897 --> 24:02.692
Did you know?

24:02.775 --> 24:04.777
That I had a father out there?

24:06.320 --> 24:08.156
Alive this whole time?

24:16.998 --> 24:19.000
[quiet sob]

24:25.673 --> 24:27.633
Fuck.

24:29.844 --> 24:31.804
Why didn't you tell me?

24:33.181 --> 24:35.183
[stammers]

24:39.437 --> 24:40.938
- [grunts]
- [squishing]

24:42.857 --> 24:44.317
[whimpering]

24:44.400 --> 24:46.402
[gurgling]

24:52.950 --> 24:55.161
[gasps]

24:56.662 --> 24:58.664
[Black Noir gurgling]

25:09.175 --> 25:10.927
You should've told me.

25:13.763 --> 25:16.515
[gulps, gasps]

25:18.851 --> 25:21.354
Oh...

25:21.437 --> 25:23.773
[all crying]

25:23.856 --> 25:26.192
D-D-Don't worry, Earving.

25:26.275 --> 25:28.903
We are so proud of you.

25:28.986 --> 25:30.780
[all crying]

25:30.863 --> 25:33.741
Soon you'll be
in the sweet embrace

25:33.824 --> 25:36.327
of C-C-C...
[stammering]

25:36.410 --> 25:38.663
Christ the Lord!

25:57.723 --> 26:00.059
[knocking on door]

26:02.436 --> 26:03.813
[Butcher] Fuck me.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.189
I figured you was dead.

26:05.273 --> 26:07.900
You didn't think I knew
where the blind spots

26:07.984 --> 26:09.318
were, motherfucker?

26:09.402 --> 26:10.486
Back up.

26:13.781 --> 26:14.740
Where's Soldier Boy?

26:14.824 --> 26:17.076
You on that Temp V shit,
Butcher, huh?

26:17.159 --> 26:19.954
What happens
if I pull this trigger?

26:20.037 --> 26:21.664
Go on, do it.

26:21.747 --> 26:22.999
Hey, M.M., M.M, stop.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.875
