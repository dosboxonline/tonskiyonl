07:11.180 --> 07:12.598
you're putting your job on the line,

07:12.682 --> 07:14.350
which means you're also
putting my job on the line.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.268
How so?

07:15.351 --> 07:17.395
Because if you get fired,
I will swim out into the ocean

07:17.478 --> 07:18.980
until I'm too tired to swim back

07:19.063 --> 07:20.231
and I will sink to the bottom
and then I won't have a job.

07:20.314 --> 07:21.566
Oh, my God. All right.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.109
Well, I'm already driving him to prison,

07:23.192 --> 07:24.610
so there's nothing I can do about it now.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.070
Oh, yes, there is.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.072
Welcome to the Boyle bus.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.615
Why we getting in this wack ride?

07:29.699 --> 07:31.993
Charles refuses to accept
what close friends we are.

07:32.076 --> 07:33.536
He thinks you're trying to escape

07:33.619 --> 07:35.413
and that your crew's on
the lookout for the Trans Am,

07:35.496 --> 07:37.498
so he insisted we switch
into his weird family bus.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.000
-That's ridiculous.
-Isn't it?

07:39.083 --> 07:40.209
It doesn't matter what vehicle we're in.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.586
That's what I said.

07:41.669 --> 07:43.087
I'm gonna escape from you either way.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.130
Exactly. Wait, what was that?

07:47.341 --> 07:48.259
[Jake] I still don't understand.

07:48.342 --> 07:49.552
What do you mean you're escaping?

07:49.635 --> 07:50.678
Sorry, bro. Plan is already in motion.

07:50.761 --> 07:51.804
Trudy came to you. You took the bait.

07:51.888 --> 07:52.722
Come on.

07:52.805 --> 07:53.931
If you were really trying to escape,

07:54.015 --> 07:55.224
why would you tell me?

07:55.308 --> 07:56.142
Honestly, I didn't like lying to you.

07:56.225 --> 07:57.310
You're a good friend.

07:57.393 --> 07:58.478
Well, if I'm such a good friend,

07:58.561 --> 07:59.562
why are you trying to escape from me?

07:59.645 --> 08:00.646
I'm not trying to escape from you.

08:00.730 --> 08:01.564
I'm trying to escape from prison.

08:01.647 --> 08:02.690
Let me ask you this.

08:02.773 --> 08:03.900
Do you know why I stole that car?

08:03.983 --> 08:05.485
Because you "love doing crimes."

08:05.568 --> 08:07.570
That's me directly
quoting your catchphrase.

08:07.653 --> 08:09.405
First of all, my catchphrase
is "slurp, slurp."

08:09.489 --> 08:11.324
-You've never once said that.
-I say it constantly.

08:11.407 --> 08:13.993
Second of all, me "loving crime"

08:14.076 --> 08:15.620
is classic empty bravado.

08:15.703 --> 08:16.954
The truth is I was arrested

08:17.038 --> 08:18.873
when I was 22 for something stupid.

08:18.956 --> 08:20.166
When I got out, nobody would hire me

08:20.249 --> 08:22.168
because I had a criminal record.

08:22.251 --> 08:24.795
My dreams of being a landscape
architect were out the window.

08:24.879 --> 08:25.713
That was your dream?

08:25.796 --> 08:27.381
I wanted to be the Black
Edward Scissorhands.

08:27.465 --> 08:28.758
-Oh, that's great.
-I get all that,

08:28.841 --> 08:30.259
but that's not what this is about.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.302
I mean, you could have escaped
from anyone,

08:31.385 --> 08:32.929
but you chose to set me up.

08:33.012 --> 08:35.431
And now my job and my name
are all on the line.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.308
You used me, Doug. You're a bad friend.

08:37.391 --> 08:38.226
You're the bad friend.

08:38.309 --> 08:40.269
I got you a tracksuit. Tigers and toucs.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.437
Might as well be a jumpsuit.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.730
A prison jumpsuit.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.357
You're taking me to prison.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.566
The fact that you thought I'd go willingly

08:45.650 --> 08:46.943
means you don't know me at all.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.111
Oh, please. I know everything about you.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.613
You didn't know my catchphrase.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.406
You have never once said
"slurp, slurp" before today.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.825
That you believe that is so hurtful.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.286
Okay, well, there's clearly
only one way to settle this.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.913
Ignore him and take him
directly to prison.

08:58.996 --> 09:00.331
A high-stakes trivia contest

09:00.414 --> 09:01.582
to decide who's the better friend.

09:01.666 --> 09:02.875
-What?
-If I win,

09:02.959 --> 09:04.502
you agree not to try and escape.

09:04.585 --> 09:05.503
But if I win, you agree to let me go.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.630
-Deal.
-That is a bad idea.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.423
I cannot let you take this risk, Jake.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.092
It'll be just like game night
at the Camden Senior Center.

09:11.175 --> 09:12.426
You can be Estelle Minderman.

09:12.510 --> 09:15.054
She's my favorite emcee. Damn it, I'm in!

09:20.518 --> 09:22.144
-Or Just Fo' Show?"
-Little wordy.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.939
Each contestant will answer
and ask ten personal questions.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.732
Whoever gets the most correct answers

09:26.816 --> 09:28.859
will be crowned the better friend.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.987
Also, there is that whole
"going to prison or not" thing.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.197
America can't relate
to the prison stuff, it's too real.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.615
It's a game about friendship,

09:34.699 --> 09:36.492
and may the better friend win.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.869
Jake, you will ask the first question.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.162
Begin!

09:40.246 --> 09:41.914
What is my middle name?

09:41.998 --> 09:44.083
You tell people it's Zack,
but it's really Jeffrey.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.168
No, it's Zack, like Zack Morris.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.670
Point for Doug.

09:47.753 --> 09:48.588
What is the name of the alter ego

09:48.671 --> 09:50.339
I use for fancy crimes?

09:50.423 --> 09:52.508
Lord Poncy Cumbershire.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.010
-'Tis correct.
-Point for Jake.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.262
What is my favorite Knicks memory?

09:56.345 --> 09:57.680
When they fired Phil Jackson.

09:57.763 --> 09:58.764
Mm.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.766
Yeah, that was a good day.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.435
What is the most embarrassing thing
that's ever happened to me?

10:02.518 --> 10:05.146
Oh, when you were
cut out of that season of <i>Real Housewives</i>

10:05.229 --> 10:06.939
-where you were dating Ramona.
-I wasn't embarrassed.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.399
I was just disappointed
at the way it was handled.

10:08.482 --> 10:09.775
Yeah.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.444
What is my least favorite word?

10:11.527 --> 10:12.361
Buttress.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.280
It just makes me picture
a mattress with a butt.

10:14.363 --> 10:16.073
What is my least favorite thing?

10:16.157 --> 10:18.326
Meringue because it looks
so much better than it tastes.

10:18.409 --> 10:19.285
It's a trick food!

the final question correctly.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.542
Otherwise, he wins. Doug, lay it on him.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.002
Hmm.

Jake Peralta, do I have an earring?

You've known me for seven years.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.061
Oh, no. I'm drawing a blank.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.729
I can kind of picture a diamond stud.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.064
That'd be a good look.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.107
Or maybe a gold cross or a little hoop.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.942
I do have versatile ears.

10:52.026 --> 10:54.278
Now I'm just seeing it
pretty clearly with no earring.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.238
Ah, this is hard.

yes, you do have an earring.
