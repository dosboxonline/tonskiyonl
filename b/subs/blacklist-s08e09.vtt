00:01.001 --> 00:03.002
[dramatic music playing]

00:18.476 --> 00:19.602
[man on phone] <i>There you are.</i>

00:19.686 --> 00:21.646
<i>Where have you been?</i>
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

00:21.730 --> 00:25.817
<i>Doesn't matter. Just listen to me.</i>
<i>There were two men. They know.</i>

00:25.900 --> 00:27.819
<i>I don't know how, but they know.</i>

00:28.319 --> 00:30.530
<i>They came to the nest</i>
<i>asking about the contract.</i>

00:30.613 --> 00:32.532
<i>They know where you are. They're coming.</i>

00:34.576 --> 00:35.744
[Raymond] Elizabeth.

00:38.496 --> 00:41.291
I think we're long overdue for a talk.

00:50.508 --> 00:52.010
[pensive music playing]

00:52.552 --> 00:54.971
What Keen has done is reprehensible.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.182
Working to exonerate the Freelancer.

00:57.265 --> 00:59.851
Using him to befriend
a war criminal like Chemical Mary.

00:59.934 --> 01:01.561
There's no defense of that.

01:01.644 --> 01:05.899
But I think maybe
I've confirmed a plausible explanation.

01:05.982 --> 01:09.277
Besides revenge against Reddington
for killing her mother?

01:09.360 --> 01:12.405
I mean an explanation that matches
what I know about Elizabeth.

01:12.489 --> 01:16.117
She wouldn't do any of this
unless it was for a cause.

01:16.659 --> 01:20.121
In this case,
outing a traitor to the United States.

01:20.663 --> 01:21.623
N-13.

01:21.706 --> 01:26.336
Elizabeth recently stole a thumb drive
from a safe deposit box of Reddington's.

01:26.419 --> 01:29.839
We know the drive contained intel
compiled by Rakitin.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.342
A hacker working for the Russians.

01:32.425 --> 01:35.845
The House intel chair thinks Rakitin
was working in the U.S. government.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.765
He was close to finding out where
when someone hacked

01:38.848 --> 01:41.726
into his committee's computer
and deleted files they had on him.

01:41.810 --> 01:44.854
-Do they know who did it?
-They don't, but I do.

01:44.938 --> 01:45.855
Reddington.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.900
Rakitin funnels stolen intel to N-13.

01:49.651 --> 01:54.155
The drive Keen has contains stolen intel
Rakitin was funneling to Reddington.

01:54.239 --> 01:57.450
Two plus two equals
Mr. Reddington is N-13.

01:57.534 --> 02:01.204
We think. We don't know.
We won't know until we find Rakitin.

02:01.287 --> 02:04.499
That's right. Fortunately, we have a lead.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.752
To be precise, five leads.

02:08.962 --> 02:14.300
The drive Keen stole contained
deep-cover intel on a series of CIA assets

02:14.384 --> 02:15.844
stationed across the globe.

02:15.927 --> 02:17.095
You decrypted it?

02:17.595 --> 02:20.014
Even the NSA couldn't decrypt it.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.976
The NSA didn't have Reddington's
thumbprint on a Scotch glass.

02:23.059 --> 02:25.395
One of these agents is Rakitin?

02:25.478 --> 02:28.273
No. But their identities
were compromised by him,

02:28.356 --> 02:30.775
so I asked the House intel chair

02:30.859 --> 02:34.320
how many people in the office
of Intelligence and Analysis

02:34.404 --> 02:37.615
had the clearance to even know
the identities of this many assets.

02:37.699 --> 02:39.159
The answer is five.

02:39.742 --> 02:43.621
I want their security clearances
frozen and a full workup done.

02:43.705 --> 02:47.625
One of these five is a traitor
to this country. I want to know who.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.839
Maybe we should ask him.

02:52.922 --> 02:53.923
[computer beeps]

02:54.966 --> 02:56.759
For now, this stays with us.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.556
We can talk in my office.

03:02.056 --> 03:03.516
Why so glum, Harold?

03:03.600 --> 03:08.062
You all look like you're in
a Bergman film playing chess with death.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.649
Housekeeping.
I know you don't like coming here.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.110
What you have to tell me must be urgent.

03:17.697 --> 03:20.325
[Dembe] We acquired
this recording late last night.

03:20.408 --> 03:22.577
[dramatic music playing]

03:22.660 --> 03:25.496
[Mary] <i>It's me.</i>
<i>Keen's willing to make a deal.</i>

03:25.580 --> 03:28.750
She wants to meet
with Neville tomorrow, here in D.C.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.001
[man] <i>He's not in the District.</i>

03:30.084 --> 03:33.588
[Mary] Then get him there.
My life depends on it.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.424
[dramatic music playing]

03:36.507 --> 03:38.259
He'll never forgive you for this.

03:38.343 --> 03:41.179
[Raymond] <i>The man is an associate</i>
<i>of Neville Townsend's.</i>

03:41.262 --> 03:44.015
I had a line on him
and a tap on his phone.

03:44.098 --> 03:47.060
But the line's been broken,
the phone disconnected.

03:47.143 --> 03:48.519
This is all I know.

03:49.103 --> 03:52.649
And as of this morning,
Neville Townsend is in the District.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.985
To meet with Elizabeth.
What we don't know is why.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.780
So she could kill him, I suspect.

03:59.864 --> 04:02.325
Townsend hunted her mother for years,

04:02.408 --> 04:04.869
forced her into hiding from Elizabeth,

04:04.953 --> 04:06.621
who now wants revenge.

04:06.704 --> 04:07.997
Why play me the recording?

04:08.081 --> 04:12.418
Because it was made on a satellite phone.
We can't pinpoint the location.

04:13.169 --> 04:14.796
So we're working together.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.758
We are.
The risks are too great if we don't.

04:19.467 --> 04:21.386
-I found one of Townsend's
-[cell phone buzzes]

04:21.469 --> 04:22.470
former bodyguards.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.264
My people are working him.

04:24.347 --> 04:27.642
Make no mistake, Harold,
by going after Townsend,

04:27.725 --> 04:31.813
Elizabeth is putting
her life in grave danger.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.108
He's on the line. He says it's urgent.

04:35.191 --> 04:36.025
Thank you.

04:39.028 --> 04:41.823
-Yeah.
-Tell me everything about this recording.

04:41.906 --> 04:45.702
I'll have the NSA
inspect the tapes with our satellites.

04:45.785 --> 04:50.164
It came in the Townsend
organization yesterday, 4:23 p.m.

04:50.248 --> 04:51.541
[Raymond] You're overreacting.

04:51.624 --> 04:55.044
They froze my security clearance.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.840
And when I say "they,"
I mean Harold Cooper.

04:59.465 --> 05:02.844
<i>The drive that was stolen,</i>
<i>he must have accessed it.</i>

05:02.927 --> 05:04.429
He is coming for me.

05:04.512 --> 05:06.931
Cooper needs to be stopped
before that happens.

05:07.015 --> 05:10.143
I said I'd take care of it, and I will.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.646
[cell phone beeps]

05:25.408 --> 05:26.242
[knocks on door]

05:31.748 --> 05:33.374
We're here for Mary.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.877
Is Neville here? Is he with you?

05:35.960 --> 05:38.796
Open the door and we can talk.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.675
[lock thunking]

05:45.136 --> 05:47.138
[static crackling on radio]

05:47.764 --> 05:50.433
[woman 1 on radio] <i>It's your staff.</i>
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

05:50.516 --> 05:52.685
-[woman 2] <i>The senator...</i>
-[static crackles]

05:52.769 --> 05:54.395
[woman 2] <i>It's being widely anticipated...</i>

05:54.479 --> 05:56.773
-[static crackling]
-You okay?

05:56.856 --> 05:58.941
-[dogs barking]
-I'm fine.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.069
You don't seem fine.

06:01.152 --> 06:04.447
Camera two, scan that second floor
again for me, will you?

06:04.530 --> 06:07.992
-[woman 3] <i>He said I could make it up...</i>
-I know how hard this is.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.244
The NSA said this is
where the call came from.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.245
Keen's here.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.872
You're doing the right thing.

06:13.247 --> 06:16.250
-Seeing this through, bringing her in.
-[man] <i>Not a problem with the wiring.</i>

06:16.334 --> 06:17.794
Make sure she doesn't get hurt.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.088
Hey, unit two, third floor west.

06:20.171 --> 06:23.424
[Vandyke on radio] <i>I know what was</i>
<i>agreed to, but he changed his mind.</i>

06:23.508 --> 06:26.260
-[Mary] <i>Just go with them. Please.</i>
-[woman] <i>Absolutely not.</i>

06:26.344 --> 06:28.930
-[Vandyke] <i>He's insisting.</i>
-[woman] <i>I gave him instructions.</i>

06:29.013 --> 06:31.224
<i>-I was very clear.</i>
-[Vandyke]<i> And I realize that.</i>

06:31.307 --> 06:32.225
Did he make us?

06:32.308 --> 06:35.228
-[man] <i>I think he did. Should we move in?</i>
-Hold tight.

06:35.311 --> 06:37.855
[Mary] <i>You understand why</i>
<i>he insists on a neutral location.</i>

06:37.939 --> 06:39.398
What do you think? Lookout?

06:40.608 --> 06:43.236
Hey, lady. These your friends?

06:43.319 --> 06:45.321
[dramatic music playing]

06:51.536 --> 06:53.371
That's her, Park. It's her.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.541
-[Mary] What are you doing?
-[Vandyke] Getting you out.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.584
Breach! Breach! All units go now!

06:59.877 --> 07:01.087
[Park] I'll take the north.

07:02.088 --> 07:05.007
Keen lied. It's a setup.
We're coming your way.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.313
[gunshots]

07:23.109 --> 07:25.570
Shots fired. Shots fired. Officer down.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.155
[grunts]

07:29.949 --> 07:32.201
[gunshots]

07:43.212 --> 07:45.256
Stop! Keen. Put it down.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.050
[gunshot]

07:49.719 --> 07:50.761
[agent] I'm okay.

08:00.438 --> 08:03.441
You want to live, you come with me.

08:25.671 --> 08:28.466
Park, they're on the street,
headed your way.

08:45.441 --> 08:48.110
Freeze! Don't move! FBI!

08:48.194 --> 08:50.279
-[Vandyke] Forget Mary. Leave her.
-[Park] Hands!

08:51.072 --> 08:52.532
Show me your hands.

09:00.164 --> 09:02.583
[Ressler] Elizabeth Keen. Where is she?

09:02.667 --> 09:05.461
I don't know. Dead, for all I care.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.088
She grabbed you in France,

09:07.171 --> 09:09.131
used you to lure out Neville Townsend.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.342
She grabbed me and befriended me.

09:11.425 --> 09:13.761
Tricked me into believing
I could trust her,

09:13.844 --> 09:16.556
when all she wanted
was to use me to betray my brother.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.100
Say that again.

09:19.183 --> 09:21.602
Neville Townsend is my brother.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.730
[Aram] A criminal
and international fugitive.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.440
Your parents must be proud.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.235
[Ressler] Keen thought
she was using you to trap Townsend.

09:29.318 --> 09:31.445
But you made sure
it was the other way around.

09:31.529 --> 09:35.241
I was minding my own business
when she kidnapped me.

09:35.324 --> 09:36.534
I've done nothing wrong.

09:36.617 --> 09:40.413
Except use chemical weapons
on men, women and children.

09:40.496 --> 09:42.373
[Mary] I'm a research scientist.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.792
If you can prove otherwise, arrest me.

09:44.875 --> 09:47.086
If not, let me go.

09:47.169 --> 09:48.921
That's not gonna happen.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.092
Then I won't tell you
what you want to know.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.720
[cell phone ringing]

09:56.554 --> 09:57.638
It's Cooper.

09:59.265 --> 10:02.310
-Tell me you found her.
-Found and lost, I'm afraid.

10:03.185 --> 10:05.438
-Townsend got there first?
<i>-He got Elizabeth.</i>

10:05.521 --> 10:07.982
We got his sister. Chemical Mary.

10:08.566 --> 10:11.444
Mary Bremmer? She's Townsend's sister?

10:11.527 --> 10:13.988
We're interrogating her,
but we're not getting anywhere.

10:15.281 --> 10:18.451
Our Townsend associate
is equally obstinate.

10:18.534 --> 10:22.371
We're ratcheting up his Q and A,
moving from paper to plastic.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.041
You know Townsend.
What hope does she have?

10:25.124 --> 10:28.336
<i>He's a dangerous man.</i>
<i>Elizabeth kidnapped his sister.</i>

10:28.419 --> 10:32.256
And now he has Elizabeth.
If I were her, I'd feel pretty hopeless.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.466
[cell phone beeps]

10:34.675 --> 10:37.678
-Any word on Agent Keen?
-No. But we found Rakitin.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.392
-[indistinct radio chatter]
-[Park] He was one of the five suspects

10:43.476 --> 10:47.063
we've been investigating at
the office of Intelligence and Analysis.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.482
Suspending his clearance spooked him.

10:49.565 --> 10:52.360
He was notified this morning
that his credentials were frozen.

10:52.443 --> 10:53.736
Left the office.

10:53.819 --> 10:57.406
Neighborhood security
found his car less than an hour later.

11:01.619 --> 11:04.497
Wrap the vehicle.
Get Evidence Response on site.

11:05.331 --> 11:08.918
Something here points to his relationship
with Reddington, and I want it found.

11:10.461 --> 11:11.962
[dramatic music playing]

11:12.046 --> 11:14.340
Godwin, I'm begging you. Please.

11:14.423 --> 11:17.218
-It's urgent.
-He gave me specific instructions.

11:17.301 --> 11:19.428
-This takes precedence.
-It'll have to wait.

11:19.512 --> 11:24.183
His last episode was four days.
He was manic. He can't be disturbed.

11:24.266 --> 11:27.770
Blake, my love, we need
to wake Mr. Townsend right now.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.112
[emotional music playing]

11:43.661 --> 11:44.787
[Blake] Neville?

11:47.915 --> 11:49.959
Neville, can you hear me?

11:58.843 --> 12:02.430
-[moans softly]
-It's okay. It's okay, Mr. Townsend.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.181
You were sleeping.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.393
[Godwin] Sir. I'm sorry to wake you, sir.

12:07.476 --> 12:09.562
It's Elizabeth Keen.

12:10.187 --> 12:11.147
We have her.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.993
I've been dreaming about you, Elizabeth.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.411
You.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.163
Your mother.

12:28.372 --> 12:32.126
The malice you must feel
toward me because of her death.

12:32.209 --> 12:33.669
It's as if I...

12:34.670 --> 12:36.505
I manifested you.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.676
Brought you here from my sleep. Why?

12:41.469 --> 12:42.761
We both know why.

12:43.721 --> 12:49.602
We know I need to be the last face you see
while you're begging for your life.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.856
[dramatic music playing]

12:56.775 --> 12:58.027
What is this?

13:01.655 --> 13:02.490
Who--?

13:04.200 --> 13:05.201
What have you done?

13:05.284 --> 13:06.535
You need to hear her out.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.538
You said you had Elizabeth Keen.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.665
[woman] Neville, look at me.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.710
I am Elizabeth Keen.

13:24.094 --> 13:26.096
Our focus was finding Elizabeth.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.516
-That's right.
<i>-We had an understanding.</i>

13:28.599 --> 13:31.477
We do, and I'm living up to that.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.396
<i>Though your tone</i>
<i>suggests you believe otherwise.</i>

13:34.480 --> 13:37.107
What suggests otherwise
is Rakitin's dead body.

13:37.191 --> 13:39.818
-What are you talking about?
-You killed him.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.403
No, I did not.

13:41.487 --> 13:45.199
You took time out from trying to find
Elizabeth in order to save your own hide.

13:45.282 --> 13:47.451
To keep him
from confirming that you're N-13.

13:48.077 --> 13:51.914
I'm not worried about my hide.
I worry about Elizabeth's.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.542
I strongly suggest you do the same.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.753
And whoever is dead,
I certainly didn't kill him.

13:57.836 --> 13:59.046
I don't believe you.

13:59.129 --> 14:01.090
That's your problem, not mine.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.516
Harold says Rakitin is dead.

14:10.599 --> 14:12.226
We would have heard.

14:14.770 --> 14:17.314
I'm gonna make some calls, scratch around.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.942
After you finish that, swing by his place

14:20.025 --> 14:21.735
and see what you can find.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.117
[Vandyke] She had it in her jacket
when I searched her.

14:33.455 --> 14:35.082
Well, Miss...

14:37.251 --> 14:38.127
Keen.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.880
This is certainly unprecedented.

14:42.840 --> 14:43.841
Where's Mary?

14:43.924 --> 14:45.426
In FBI custody.

14:45.509 --> 14:48.387
And she took her, what, to hurt me?

14:48.470 --> 14:50.431
Talk to me, Neville.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.684
I'm right here. I'm looking right at you.

14:59.148 --> 15:02.776
<i>Why did you take my sister?</i>

15:03.652 --> 15:05.821
Because I had no way to reach you.

15:06.614 --> 15:09.325
Abducting your sister
forced her to make contact,

15:09.408 --> 15:11.243
to negotiate her own return

15:11.327 --> 15:14.038
and to get this
face-to-face meeting with you.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.540
I had nothing to do with today's capture.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.418
-No? You're an FBI agent.
-Not anymore, I'm not.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.754
The FBI can't help me.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.465
You can.

15:26.425 --> 15:30.971
If you thought saving my sister would
put you in my good graces, you're wrong.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.974
Besides, why would you think I'd help you?

15:34.058 --> 15:35.893
I've done nothing but hurt you.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.937
I murdered your mother.
I'll kill you once--

15:38.020 --> 15:41.148
You believe my mother was murdered
by the Kazanjian Brothers.

15:41.732 --> 15:42.942
That never happened.

15:43.651 --> 15:44.944
They betrayed you,

15:45.027 --> 15:46.987
cut a deal with my mother
to fake her death

15:47.071 --> 15:49.698
and buy her the time
she needed to clear her name.

15:51.325 --> 15:54.536
-I don't believe any of this.
-I don't expect you to.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.415
You've spent 30 years hunting my mother

15:58.499 --> 16:02.211
because you believe
she's the Russian turncoat they call N-13.

16:02.878 --> 16:03.963
She's not.

16:05.005 --> 16:06.006
She was innocent.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.425
Katarina Rostova is N-13.

16:08.509 --> 16:12.513
Katarina Rostova was framed
by her father and set up as a patsy.

16:12.596 --> 16:15.307
She knew the world
would never stop hunting her

16:15.391 --> 16:18.769
until she could prove that truth,
a truth she died trying to uncover.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.270
You said she was alive.

16:20.854 --> 16:24.191
She was. Until Raymond Reddington
killed her.

16:25.109 --> 16:30.155
<i>Are you saying Reddington killed her</i>
<i>to hide the fact he's N-13?</i>

16:31.073 --> 16:32.032
Yes.

16:32.533 --> 16:33.909
And I can prove it.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.912
He's the reason your family is dead.

16:37.538 --> 16:41.542
He's the one you need to kill.
I'm here to help you do exactly that.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.173
<i>Tell me more.</i>

16:59.059 --> 17:00.269
[dramatic music playing]

17:00.352 --> 17:01.812
What are you up to?

17:02.730 --> 17:06.191
They wanted Rakitin.
I gave them someone who fits the bill.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.193
I told you I was handling it.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.405
-Does Cooper believe it was me?
-That's not the point.

17:11.488 --> 17:12.990
That's the only point.

17:14.283 --> 17:17.161
The witch hunt is over and
there's one less government knob

17:17.244 --> 17:18.996
sticking his nose into our business.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.497
You should be thanking me.

17:21.665 --> 17:22.791
You tricked them.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.211
For a day, maybe two.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.214
But they'll see past it.

17:29.298 --> 17:32.342
And when they do,
they'll come looking for you.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.511
You give them too much credit.

17:36.305 --> 17:40.809
My friend, I am engaged
in a 30-year project.

17:40.893 --> 17:44.438
Now, you may be a vital part of that,

17:44.521 --> 17:46.774
but if you jeopardize it again,

17:46.857 --> 17:49.651
as the impetuous amateur that you are,

17:49.735 --> 17:52.488
I will let you go permanently.

17:53.614 --> 17:54.865
Is that clear?

18:00.287 --> 18:01.872
[Park] Still combing through surveillance.

18:01.955 --> 18:04.208
I can't believe she'd work
with someone like this.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.543
She was using her to get to Townsend.

18:06.627 --> 18:09.713
Have you seen what she's done?
Chemical Mary?

18:09.797 --> 18:13.967
The way her weapons have been used
against civilians, children.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.886
[dramatic music playing]

18:15.969 --> 18:19.181
The Agent Keen I know
wouldn't use someone like this

18:19.264 --> 18:21.308
to get to Townsend or anyone else.

18:21.391 --> 18:25.187
She'd arrest her and make sure
she couldn't hurt anyone again.

18:25.687 --> 18:27.231
Whoa.

18:27.314 --> 18:28.857
-What is it?
-Look.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.944
This is footage from the raid.
And that's supposed to be her.

18:32.027 --> 18:34.071
-[Aram] Agent Keen.
-[Park] Right. Except...

18:34.154 --> 18:34.988
[keyboard clacks]

18:35.531 --> 18:37.699
[dramatic music playing]

18:37.783 --> 18:40.994
-[Aram] It's not Agent Keen.
-[Park] Someone's pretending to be her.

18:41.578 --> 18:43.247
Why would anyone do that?

18:43.330 --> 18:48.085
But more importantly, this woman,
where did they take her?

18:50.212 --> 18:52.631
[Katarina on recording] <i>I can't imagine</i>
<i>what this must be like for you.</i>

18:52.714 --> 18:57.219
<i>Knowing you can't kill me because</i>
<i>of how much Elizabeth loves her mother.</i>

18:57.302 --> 18:58.637
[gunshots on recording]

19:04.143 --> 19:07.146
<i>That's quite... convincing.</i>

19:07.729 --> 19:12.317
I wouldn't have gone to the effort
of taking your sister, luring you out,

19:12.401 --> 19:15.320
of making this pitch unless I was certain.

19:16.405 --> 19:20.159
Reddington killed my mother
because she had uncovered the truth.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.244
She had evidence.

19:22.744 --> 19:25.455
She discovered his plan
and he killed her to keep her quiet.

19:26.456 --> 19:29.001
Even if you're right,
why would I trust you?

19:29.084 --> 19:30.878
I'm not an FBI agent.

19:30.961 --> 19:34.548
The FBI raided my team
during a meeting with you.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.925
They have my sister.
They'll force her to talk.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.012
Those are the very people
enabling Reddington, working with him.

19:40.095 --> 19:41.638
The FBI--

19:41.722 --> 19:44.057
He's embedded himself in the Bureau.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.642
Gained their trust.

19:46.310 --> 19:49.646
To what end, I don't know,
which is why I need your help.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.191
-You mean my money.
-Your influence.

19:53.025 --> 19:57.237
Look, Reddington has an army
on both sides of the law.

19:57.321 --> 20:00.032
I can't do this alone. I need a partner.

20:01.283 --> 20:05.829
What you've done,
coming here like this, it's...

20:07.581 --> 20:09.291
It's audacious.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.712
<i>But if I were</i>
<i>to even consider an alliance,</i>

20:13.795 --> 20:17.007
<i>I'd need to know, without question,</i>

20:17.090 --> 20:19.092
that I can trust you.

20:19.801 --> 20:21.053
You can trust me.

20:23.972 --> 20:25.390
I hope so.

20:25.474 --> 20:29.394
Which is why I'm going
to give you an opportunity to prove it.

20:29.478 --> 20:33.607
[Ressler] I can see it's not Keen. What
I can't figure out is why it's not Keen.

20:33.690 --> 20:36.151
How did she find someone
that looks exactly like her?

20:36.235 --> 20:38.153
Just got the forensics
back from the scene.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.405
No hit on the prints
or facial recognition.

20:40.489 --> 20:43.700
Whoever Keen's doppelgänger is,
she's not in any database.

20:43.784 --> 20:46.536
-We've got nothing. No leads.
-We don't have to find her.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.039
Why not? She could lead us to Keen.

20:49.122 --> 20:51.124
Because she found us.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.710
She surrendered herself five minutes ago.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.338
[suspenseful music playing]

21:01.843 --> 21:03.512
[Ressler] We can sit here all day.

21:03.595 --> 21:07.432
But this, whatever it is we're doing,
it's not gonna work.

21:07.516 --> 21:10.519
Look, you obviously are working with her.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.396
You're some kind of surrogate.

21:12.479 --> 21:16.066
-Tell me how I can help.
-Ressler, I told you what I need.

21:16.149 --> 21:17.651
It's Agent Ressler.

21:17.734 --> 21:18.652
Donald.

21:19.444 --> 21:20.445
Come on.

21:22.155 --> 21:23.490
I care about you.

21:24.616 --> 21:28.453
I want to end this as much as you do,
but I need your help.

21:28.537 --> 21:29.955
We're not giving you immunity.

21:30.038 --> 21:33.292
I can't tell you what's happening
until you do. Please.

21:33.875 --> 21:35.210
Talk to me about Keen.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.545
I told you, it's me.

21:38.380 --> 21:39.256
No.

21:41.049 --> 21:42.259
You want proof?

21:42.342 --> 21:44.344
[dramatic music playing]

21:45.512 --> 21:47.264
Why don't we start with what happened

21:47.347 --> 21:49.891
between you and me the night
before I went on the run?

21:52.477 --> 21:54.271
Who the hell are you?

21:55.355 --> 21:56.189
Harold.

21:56.898 --> 21:59.651
Please. I need your help.

21:59.735 --> 22:02.863
Reach out to Panabaker.
See if she'll consider a deal.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.282
[Panabaker] <i>Absolutely not!</i>

22:05.365 --> 22:07.826
Giving her immunity
is the only way we find Keen.

22:07.909 --> 22:10.746
Giving who immunity?
We don't even know who she is.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.372
[Ressler] We know
she knows a lot about Keen.

22:12.456 --> 22:15.167
What she knows is that you thought
it was a fine idea to dip

22:15.250 --> 22:18.253
your wick in the fugitive end of the pool.
Honestly, Harold,

22:18.337 --> 22:21.298
sometimes I wonder if Keen is
out there because you can't find her

22:21.381 --> 22:24.843
-or because none of you want to.
-It's hard going after a colleague.

22:24.926 --> 22:27.054
I make no secret of that,
but I'd remind you

22:27.137 --> 22:28.805
that we apprehended Chemical Mary,

22:28.889 --> 22:31.767
a war criminal who has
eluded capture for over a decade.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.435
Thanks to this task force,

22:33.518 --> 22:37.105
she is sitting in an interrogation room
awaiting transport to central lockup.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.899
I am aware you have neutered

22:38.982 --> 22:41.026
more than your fair share
of swamp creatures,

22:41.109 --> 22:43.570
which is why I give you a long leash.

22:43.653 --> 22:46.239
But it's not so long that
I'll approve granting immunity

22:46.323 --> 22:49.117
to someone whose identity I am unaware of.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.995
Go over the forensics again.
Facial recognition, prints.

22:52.079 --> 22:54.915
-See what you can find.
-Be good if that included your dignity.

I was mistaken.

<i>Townsend doesn't have her.</i>
<i>We thought he did.</i>

23:05.342 --> 23:08.553
When we raided her safe house,
we thought we saw his team grab Keen.

23:08.637 --> 23:10.722
It turns out it was a look-alike.

If you boys are done
mansplaining to each other.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.812
Play nice. Cynthia Panabaker is here.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.774
<i>-Tell me about this look-alike.</i>
-She's a walk-in.

23:20.857 --> 23:23.860
She'll lead us to Keen if she gets
immunity, which I will not grant

23:23.944 --> 23:25.737
<i>until I know who we're dealing with.</i>

23:25.821 --> 23:27.697
A look-alike? A walk-in?

23:27.781 --> 23:30.742
Someone who knows
how to lead you to Agent Keen?

23:30.826 --> 23:34.996
Be careful, Harold. I suspect
that woman may be a Cyranoid.

25:23.271 --> 25:25.857
I am going to confront her
with her crimes.

25:25.941 --> 25:28.777
-She cut the feed, Keen's Cyranoid.
-[Park] Her what?

25:28.860 --> 25:31.655
The doppelgänger.
We've lost visual contact.

-Your brother. He sent me.
-What? How?

25:50.006 --> 25:51.424
What do you mean "sent"?

25:52.425 --> 25:53.843
[Liz Double] <i>I am not a murderer.</i>

25:53.927 --> 25:57.514
She knows too much.
She's made herself a liability.

25:57.597 --> 25:58.932
She's your sister.

25:59.015 --> 26:01.142
You can't beat Reddington without me.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.269
That's why you're here.

26:02.352 --> 26:05.230
You need me on your team.
This is my price.

-Aram, it's me. It's Liz.

-Get on the ground.

27:07.959 --> 27:10.086
I hired the woman you're looking at.

27:10.170 --> 27:14.090
I can see and hear everything she does.
She says what I tell her--

27:14.174 --> 27:16.009
I said get on the ground.

27:16.092 --> 27:18.053
That's how she knew about the task force,

27:18.136 --> 27:21.056
how she got out of interrogation.
I told her to kill the cameras.

27:21.139 --> 27:23.975
-I gave her the codes.
-Stop where you are or I'll shoot.

27:24.059 --> 27:25.143
Turbo.

27:26.811 --> 27:29.314
-What?
-Your pet turtle's name is Turbo.

27:30.315 --> 27:33.610
You bike to work.
You like salad dressing on the side.

27:33.693 --> 27:37.822
-Your last girlfriend was a sociopath--
-Don't come any closer.

27:37.906 --> 27:40.241
Aram, it's me.

27:42.702 --> 27:46.915
Breach control, Sector Four.
We need a team at the south egress.

27:46.998 --> 27:52.253
If you're Liz
or acting for Liz, whatever...

27:53.213 --> 27:57.092
why kill Mary Bremmer?
Liz would never do that.

27:57.175 --> 27:59.219
I don't expect you to understand,

27:59.302 --> 28:02.263
but I am doing
what is necessary to end this,

28:02.347 --> 28:04.307
to stop Reddington.

28:04.391 --> 28:06.101
She was in our custody.

28:06.184 --> 28:09.437
She was a murderer, Aram.
She killed innocents.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.691
No.

28:15.610 --> 28:16.986
No.

28:40.927 --> 28:42.762
I need to speak with the Commissioner.

28:45.098 --> 28:47.892
The Commissioner.
Isn't that what he calls himself?

28:47.976 --> 28:50.061
You said he calls himself
the Commissioner.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.272

30:32.038 --> 30:33.873
This is surreal.

30:43.007 --> 30:44.717
<i>Who I am doesn't matter.</i>

30:44.801 --> 30:47.512
What does matter is that I found you

30:49.639 --> 30:51.850

Okay, just hold on. Slow down.

30:59.023 --> 31:00.692
I don't have client information.

31:00.775 --> 31:04.279
I suspect you keep a rather
close watch on your clients.

31:04.362 --> 31:07.532
On their money, yes. On their payments.

31:07.615 --> 31:09.117
Not their physical whereabouts.

31:09.200 --> 31:12.620
The only way to do that is to trace
the signal while they're communicating...

31:12.704 --> 31:14.414
Through their Cyranoid in real time.

31:14.497 --> 31:18.459
Okay, then. The location
of Elizabeth Keen's Cyranoid.

31:58.666 --> 32:00.209
You know where to find me.

32:00.293 --> 32:01.836
As a matter of fact, I do.

-I've been on assignment.

-There were two men. They know.

I don't know how, but they know.

We correspond through--

33:02.230 --> 33:03.481
The interface. I know.

33:03.564 --> 33:06.442
Which is why the Commissioner
was forced to give your location.

33:11.698 --> 33:12.740

We're talking now.

-Where are you? I can come to you.
-I don't want to see you.

We need to speak, face to face,
just you and I--

34:52.507 --> 34:54.258
That's the thing about you.

34:54.342 --> 34:57.220
You're used to getting
your way every time.

Well, that's not gonna work with me,
not anymore.

35:00.473 --> 35:03.017
You can't follow or interrogate me.

35:03.101 --> 35:06.896
That's why I have a Cyranoid,
to eliminate your control.

35:08.689 --> 35:10.817
And as far as finding me, good luck.

35:11.609 --> 35:13.402
Goodbye, Reddington.

35:17.031 --> 35:20.368
Now you're gonna kill
an innocent bystander to get to me?

The innocent bystander you used
for your contract killing of Mary Bremmer?

that makes her a murderer.

The demarcation between
what you won't stand for

even as it rots your soul.

If I had a quarter for every time
I've asked myself that question...

38:10.329 --> 38:12.415
I can't unsee what I saw.

38:13.332 --> 38:16.502
Of course you can. People do it every day.

Look away from bigotry,
degradation, disease.

Ignore injustice.

You don't understand Agent Keen,
what she's been through,

the incredible burden Reddington placed
on her. If you knew the whole story,

38:39.233 --> 38:40.735
if you knew half of it...

38:41.569 --> 38:44.780
you'd be as amazed as I am
that she's behaved as well as she has.

38:44.864 --> 38:47.992
I never could have.
I don't know anyone who could.

No.

-It is now. It wasn't when he died.

39:17.730 --> 39:20.024
-What do you mean?
-He had a laptop in his vehicle.

39:20.107 --> 39:23.235
None of the files on the agents
found on Rakitin's drive was there

39:23.319 --> 39:26.489
-at the time of his death.
-So who input the data?

39:26.572 --> 39:29.950
How about Rakitin? Think.
He knows we're looking for him.

39:30.034 --> 39:32.328
I don't know how, but just go with it.

39:32.411 --> 39:35.664
He knows there's only five people
with access to this kind of intel.

39:35.748 --> 39:36.874
So he kills one of them

39:36.957 --> 39:39.460
and uploads the incriminating data
onto his computer.

39:39.543 --> 39:42.088
-He did us a favor.
-How do you figure?

39:42.171 --> 39:45.091
Originally, we had five suspects.
and now we have four.

39:45.174 --> 39:47.802
That puts us 20 percent closer
to finding Rakitin.

39:47.885 --> 39:49.595
What's she gonna do?

39:49.678 --> 39:51.639
Issue an arrest warrant for Keen.

39:51.722 --> 39:53.265
You couldn't talk her out of that?

39:53.891 --> 39:55.518
I asked her to do it.

40:37.768 --> 40:38.853
Reddington.

40:39.437 --> 40:40.980
Where's Elizabeth Keen?

40:41.063 --> 40:43.649
Life is full of little surprises,
isn't it?

40:44.150 --> 40:46.861
Imagine mine when I learned Rostova
wasn't responsible

40:46.944 --> 40:48.320
for the death of my family.

40:48.904 --> 40:49.738
But she was.

40:49.822 --> 40:51.574
Keen says otherwise.

40:52.908 --> 40:56.454
A daughter wanting to believe
there was good in a mother who was bad.

40:56.537 --> 40:59.874
<i>I heard the tape, you killing Rostova</i>
<i>to cover the truth.</i>

40:59.957 --> 41:03.502
So very operatic, even for you.

41:04.378 --> 41:06.964
Elizabeth Keen is not to be trusted.

41:07.047 --> 41:09.675
Oh, I think she is.

41:09.758 --> 41:12.553
She's proven herself
quite an asset already.

41:12.636 --> 41:14.221
Murdering your sister.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.348
<i>Above and beyond, I think you'll agree.</i>

41:16.432 --> 41:21.562
It seems that there is literally nothing
she won't do to get to you.

41:22.146 --> 41:25.232
<i>You certainly collect</i>
<i>enemies in your wake.</i>

41:25.316 --> 41:30.070
And as the wise men say,
the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

41:30.154 --> 41:34.200
My issues with Elizabeth Keen
don't concern you.

41:34.909 --> 41:38.162
And my issues with you don't concern her.

41:38.245 --> 41:42.374
Oh, but they do, in ways
you've kept secret for far too long.

41:42.458 --> 41:47.796
It turns out that you're due
for a reckoning.

41:48.547 --> 41:52.259
And Elizabeth Keen and I
are coming to deliver one.

41:54.595 --> 41:56.347
[dramatic music playing]

42:07.816 --> 42:09.235
Try and get some sleep.

42:09.318 --> 42:10.986
I always try.

42:15.032 --> 42:16.742
And I never do.
