-[man 2] Always the best.

00:09.551 --> 00:11.177
[tense music playing]

00:15.807 --> 00:18.435
[interviewer] In the eyes of society,
you're looked at as a criminal.

00:18.518 --> 00:19.853
What are your thoughts about that?

00:19.936 --> 00:22.605
I don't mind being looked at
as a criminal, really.

00:23.606 --> 00:26.026
It's tough. I mean,
I just was doing crimes my whole life.

00:26.901 --> 00:28.153
Scamming and shit like that.

00:28.236 --> 00:30.363
-[man 1] A scammer, huh?
-[man 2] Yeah, a scammer.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.865
I just think things have changed.

00:31.948 --> 00:34.784
You know, it's not that easy
to just work hard and buy a house.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.829
Nowadays, you gotta figure out
some sorta of way to finesse the system.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.789
That's the modern-day American Dream.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.877
[interviewer]
How much did you make in total?

00:44.419 --> 00:46.546
Uh, on paper, 32 million.

00:46.629 --> 00:48.965
But, like, in reality,
we made like a few hundred million.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.761
-[interviewer] Well, that's good. [laughs]
-Yeah. Trapanis.

00:53.428 --> 00:54.971
[interviewer] Would you do it again?

00:55.055 --> 00:59.642
Uhâ€¦ I always go back to this point of,
if I knew it 100% that I was gonna make

00:59.726 --> 01:02.604
$30 million doing something illegal,
would I do it? Would I not?

01:06.608 --> 01:08.902
I would lean on
that I would take the risk.

01:10.653 --> 01:14.491
[tense music ends]

01:22.123 --> 01:23.083
[upbeat music playing]

01:23.166 --> 01:26.878
[man] I was at the New York Times
covering the cryptocurrency universe.

01:27.629 --> 01:31.883
I was the only person
at the paper who took it seriously.

01:34.511 --> 01:38.098
Most of the editors at the paper
continued to view this as a joke.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.683
It was sort of my job to say,

01:40.767 --> 01:44.521
"You know, there's something real
going on here that is worth covering."

01:44.604 --> 01:49.109
The people who cared about Bitcoin
really cared about Bitcoin.

01:49.192 --> 01:52.779
I trust the Bitcoin. I believe in
the Bitcoin. I worship the Bitcoin.

01:52.862 --> 01:56.574
[Popper] I actually started
to get captivated by this thing.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.244
This was like digital gold.

01:59.327 --> 02:02.080
[man] Your boy is officially
a Bitcoin millionaire.

02:02.163 --> 02:04.332
You guys have no idea
how much this means to me.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.043
[Popper]
It tapped into something in people.

02:07.127 --> 02:11.214
Sixty-four thousand dollars
in a couple of days doing zero work.

02:12.590 --> 02:15.426
[Popper] And then, in the middle of 2017,

02:15.510 --> 02:19.180
you had the rise
of the initial coin offering.

02:20.014 --> 02:22.308
Every day there was a new project

02:22.392 --> 02:25.645
that overnight raised
tens of millions of dollars.

02:25.728 --> 02:27.981
It became this, like, total phenomenon.

02:28.064 --> 02:33.611
Every day I see three or four
new offerings of Bitcoin number three.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.989
"This'll be better than Bitcoin.
You'll get rich overnight."

02:36.072 --> 02:37.365
Crypto-mania rages on.

02:37.448 --> 02:39.659
The future of the financial system.

02:39.742 --> 02:41.703
[reporter 1]
He became a millionaire at 24.

02:41.786 --> 02:43.621
[reporter 2]
ICOs are gonna change the world.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.748
-We will write history.
-[audience cheers]

02:45.832 --> 02:48.293
[Popper] I mean, it was an economic frenzy

02:48.376 --> 02:52.547
that really had not been seen
before cryptocurrencies.

02:52.630 --> 02:55.508
There may not be anything there.
Companies weren't really incented

02:55.592 --> 02:58.011
to actually do anything with the money
besides spending the money.

02:58.094 --> 03:02.056
[Popper]
ICOs allowed anybody to start selling

03:02.140 --> 03:05.852
and marketing financial products
without a bank account.

03:06.436 --> 03:09.230
There was just scams
and frauds everywhere.

03:09.814 --> 03:12.066
Anybody could create an ICO,

03:12.650 --> 03:14.068
and anybody did do it. [chuckles]

03:14.152 --> 03:17.030
[mellow music playing]

03:19.282 --> 03:24.537
Centra was the archetype
of what was wrong with cryptocurrency.

03:25.622 --> 03:28.333
Crypto was just this new,
unfound territory.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.418
Completely unregulated by the SEC.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.962
And anytime you find a market like that,

03:33.046 --> 03:35.215
you just have to figure out
how to exploit that market.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.300
[pensive music playing]

03:38.092 --> 03:40.178
We didn't know anything
about this fucking business.

03:40.845 --> 03:43.681
But it didn't matter at all.
It was too easy.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.767
We lied, we cheated,

03:46.309 --> 03:48.019
and made millions of dollars.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.939
And now I'm facing over 100 years.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.027
[music fades]

03:56.110 --> 03:59.530
Ever since I was a kid,
I've always wanted to be a criminal.

03:59.614 --> 04:03.243
I was never like, "I'm gonna be a doctor,"
or, "I'm gonna be a scientist."

04:03.326 --> 04:06.996
If I could have put it in my yearbook,
I would have put, "I wanna be a criminal."

04:07.080 --> 04:07.914
[chuckles] You know.

04:07.997 --> 04:09.749
[pensive music playing]

04:09.832 --> 04:10.833
That explains it.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.591
My mom was a single mom of three boys.

04:19.550 --> 04:22.262
I wish my dad was around. He just wasn't.

04:22.345 --> 04:25.265
He was a complete fucking loser,
and, you know, that's that.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.396
[man] Ray's always tried really hard.

04:31.896 --> 04:33.564
He was trying to be
someone from the street,

04:33.648 --> 04:35.358
and he's not someone from the street.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.151
He's from Atlantic Beach.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.070
Where beaches are.

[seagulls cawing]

04:40.697 --> 04:42.282
[intriguing music playing]

04:42.365 --> 04:46.202
At the time,
that area was so flooded with oxy

04:46.286 --> 04:49.205
we were already
full-blown drug addicts, for sure.

04:49.914 --> 04:51.582
I loved the kid at the time.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.210
Ray was, like, one of the first
best friends I had.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.048
We started, you know, filling scrips.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.883
[pills rattling]

05:00.967 --> 05:03.636
We met some kid
who stole a prescription pad.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.556
That prescription pad got stolen from him.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.766
[Ray] We write out 120 oxys,

05:08.850 --> 05:10.643
took that prescription
and went to a Walgreens.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.061
[intriguing music continues]

05:13.479 --> 05:14.731
They filled it.

05:16.607 --> 05:19.027
It's always a cool feeling
when you hit that first mark.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.194
Fucking all amped up.

05:20.278 --> 05:23.990
You have the whole prescription pad,
knowing this is an unlimited money glitch.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.910
My freezer was just thousands of pills.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.787
[interviewer] How much were you making?

05:30.204 --> 05:33.333
We were making like 5000 a day,
you know, on a good day.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.668
[interviewer] At this age you're making
that kind of money.

05:35.752 --> 05:36.919
What're you spending money on?

05:37.003 --> 05:37.837
[inhales]

05:38.421 --> 05:40.131
More drugs. [laughs]

05:43.051 --> 05:44.302
Just having fun.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.475
And thenâ€¦

05:51.225 --> 05:53.353
[sirens wailing]

05:53.436 --> 05:54.562
Ray got in trouble.

05:55.271 --> 05:58.316
He got pulled over,
and they found the bottle that said,

05:58.399 --> 06:00.651
you know, a name on it
that was probably not his name.

06:01.235 --> 06:03.529
They asked him where he got it,
and he ratted on me

06:03.613 --> 06:05.573
andâ€¦ and everyone else
that filled out scrips.

06:05.656 --> 06:07.116
-[interviewer] Really?
-Yeah.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.203
-[interviewer] Did you get in trouble?
-Yeah. I mean, I did.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.456
I was going back and forth
to court for like two years.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.291
[interviewer] What did Ray get?

06:15.375 --> 06:16.501
Uh, nothing.

06:18.503 --> 06:19.587
-Why?
-[chuckles] When--

06:19.670 --> 06:22.840
When you talk to the police,
you're, you know, you're good.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.802
[solemn music playing]

06:25.885 --> 06:29.889
So it surprises me that he has
a tattoo of "loyalty" on his ribs,

06:29.972 --> 06:32.558
and he's never been loyal
to not one of his friends.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.479
It's disappointing
that he turned out to be the way he is.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.984
Ray's a piece of shit, you know?

06:42.068 --> 06:44.278
-[synthwave music playing]
-[car engine revving]

06:50.451 --> 06:54.997
Sex, drugs, money. Anything that releases
endorphins, I am instantly, fucking,

06:55.081 --> 06:57.875
I go, "I'll drop everything
for this right now." [laughs]

06:57.959 --> 06:59.168
[music continues]

07:01.796 --> 07:05.007
I have a good brain for, you know,
making money at whatever it is.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.927
So when Bert reached out to me
with a legitimate business idea,

07:08.010 --> 07:08.845
I was game.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.013
[car engine revving]

07:11.097 --> 07:13.266
[man] I've known Ray since third grade.

07:14.225 --> 07:17.603
He's always been fascinated with money.
He's obsessed with it.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.689
That's his one true love.

07:20.189 --> 07:21.023
That's Ray.

07:23.317 --> 07:26.112
[Ray] Bert was always in the car business,
so he knew the market.

07:26.195 --> 07:29.949
And we came up with Miami Exotics,
which is a car rental business.

07:30.032 --> 07:31.325
Luxury cars.

07:32.743 --> 07:34.287
Rolls Royce, Lamborghinis.

07:34.370 --> 07:35.788
[synthwave music ends]

07:35.872 --> 07:38.291
[car engine revving]

07:38.791 --> 07:42.086
This was my transition
into having a legitimate company.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.882
I've done a lot of fraudulent scams
and all this type of shit,

07:45.965 --> 07:48.050
but I don't really know business yet.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.307
But Bert knew the perfect guy,
and, you know, I knew him also.

07:54.390 --> 07:55.892
So we brought in Sorbee.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.020
-[car engine revving]
-[upbeat music playing]

07:59.103 --> 08:01.731
[upbeat music playing]

08:01.814 --> 08:05.109
And Sorbee was a kid from high school
that I fucking hated. [chuckles]

08:09.071 --> 08:10.865
He was always the smart kid,

08:10.948 --> 08:13.743
but he was never a kid
that I trusted or liked.

08:14.327 --> 08:18.289
[Bert] Ray and Sorbee were never friends.
They always disliked each other.

08:20.791 --> 08:23.961
He just had this weaselly way
where he thought he was super cool.

08:24.045 --> 08:27.131
Like, kind of wanted to be ghetto
but sounded super nerdy.

08:27.215 --> 08:30.635
He was known for being
a scammer or, like, ripping people off.

08:30.718 --> 08:33.763
I don't know, he just wasn't
my type of people. He does add value.

08:33.846 --> 08:37.016
Me and Bert are very good at, like,
relationships and being able to just be,

08:37.099 --> 08:39.810
like, the charismatic people
that can make the money.

08:40.353 --> 08:43.814
And so, like, having Sorbee there
is very beneficial.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.400
You can just keep him
in a room working all day.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.945
It's not like everybody's
just good at the same shit.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.488
[upbeat music ends]

08:50.571 --> 08:53.241
[interviewer] How much money
did you need to raise to start this?

08:53.324 --> 08:55.493
Uh, roughly half a million dollars.

08:56.619 --> 08:59.497
You know, Ray called me and he said,
you know, "We just need financing."

08:59.580 --> 09:00.706
[happy music playing]

09:00.790 --> 09:03.334
So he went to my parents.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.462
He's been saying he's gonna
be rich since he could talk.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.632
Probably comes from my father.

09:10.424 --> 09:14.637
My dad was a very good man,
and he always took care of my family.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.600
[Ray] Growing up, my grandfather
was my only father figure that I had.

09:19.684 --> 09:20.685
We all called him Pop.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.896
My grandfather was,
all in all, a great guy.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.567
Doing criminal shit
doesn't mean you're a bad person.

09:27.650 --> 09:28.985
I always looked at my grandfather

09:29.068 --> 09:31.320
like he was
the biggest mob boss there ever was.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.323
He was able to support
my family financially.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.868
I was like,
"You know, I'm gonna be a criminal

09:37.952 --> 09:40.037
and support my family financially also."

09:40.121 --> 09:44.250
I don't know if he saw, like, you know,
suitcases of cash like I did.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.003
-[interviewer] You saw suitcases of cash?
-Yeah.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.880
What are you trying to say?
He's in the mafia?

09:49.964 --> 09:53.342
No, I'm more in the mafia
than he was. [laughs]

09:54.218 --> 09:55.678
[Pat laughing]

09:55.761 --> 09:58.431
Bill did something
to do with the elevator business.

09:58.514 --> 09:59.765
[elevator dings]

10:01.475 --> 10:04.520
We went down to Florida
to visit him, me and Bill.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.606
Met his partners.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.150
[gentle music playing]

10:11.152 --> 10:13.696
He saw me happy,
which was, like, the big thing for him.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.823
They just believed in me and were like,

10:15.906 --> 10:19.201
"Here's an opportunity. Make it whatever
you think you're gonna make it."

10:19.285 --> 10:22.913
Bill would do anything for Ray,
and so he was the father figure.

10:23.539 --> 10:26.459
My grandfather signed, you know,
a quarter million-dollar loan

10:26.542 --> 10:28.669
against his house,
a home equity line of credit,

10:28.753 --> 10:31.130
to give me some sort of opportunity
of having this business.

10:33.382 --> 10:35.885
We took that opportunity
and tried to go fully legit.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.932
["Going Off" by P-Lo playing]

[Ray] The business was generating

We were renting cars to Rick Ross,
everybody under the sun.

10:56.322 --> 10:59.700

have my beautiful apartment

There was a good minute there,

11:24.100 --> 11:26.769
everything was prettyâ€¦
pretty fun and enjoyable.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.270
[car alarm beeps]

11:28.354 --> 11:29.480
[car engine revving]

11:30.272 --> 11:33.067
The issue was
that the spending was out of hand.

11:33.150 --> 11:35.152
[brooding music playing]

11:37.697 --> 11:42.034
If the company is generating a profit
of 60,000, between the three of us,

11:42.118 --> 11:44.620
somehow we were spending
more than that every month.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.750
I ended up getting more loans
for roughly a half a million dollars.

11:49.834 --> 11:54.171
Just about everybody in my family,
my aunts, my mom, her husband, my grandma,

11:54.255 --> 11:57.842
co-signed some sort of car loan
or credit card loan.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.677
I saw Sorbee on Instagram.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.555
He posted a big vacation
that he had in the Bahamas.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.849
And that's when I was like,
"What is this kid doing?"

12:05.349 --> 12:07.810
Obviously, you know,
something was not right.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.562
[brooding music continues]

12:18.237 --> 12:20.197
Vacations, hotels.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.868
Whether it be, like,
Sorbee going out to the club,

12:23.951 --> 12:26.620
or me just gambling,
or whatever it may be.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.289
Bert buying a fucking dog.

12:28.372 --> 12:29.832
[panting]

12:29.915 --> 12:33.711
Bert went and he bought, like,
a $2,000 dog on the company card.

12:33.794 --> 12:36.380
[Ray] Money was leaking out
left and right in these weird areas.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.924
And then, like,
sometimes just checks would be cashed.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.677
Sorbee robbed the company.
That's what happened.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.138
But the checks were written
in Bert's name. So, you know.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.599
Sorbee was forging my name

12:47.183 --> 12:50.060
and signing it to himself
and cashing them.

12:50.644 --> 12:53.522
I don't fucking know who was writing
those checks. I still don't know.

12:54.023 --> 12:56.942
Bert and Sorbee had no skin in the game
as far as finances.

12:57.026 --> 13:00.738
I'll give anything to my family,
but not to youâ€¦ you little pricks.

13:00.821 --> 13:01.655
Really.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.534
And there was always the excuse of,
"Oh, you're spending crazy money also."

13:05.618 --> 13:09.747
But, you know, the thing is, those debts
were all my debts toâ€¦ to deal with,

13:09.830 --> 13:10.915
my family's loans.

13:10.998 --> 13:14.001
So that's where, like,
I just started to go fucking crazy.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.004
[Kerri] They 100% took advantage of him.

13:17.087 --> 13:19.882
[interviewer] Do you think he took
advantage of you guys? That Ray did?

13:19.965 --> 13:22.384
Do I think that Ray took advantage?
Yes, I do.

13:22.468 --> 13:25.721
[somber music playing]

13:25.805 --> 13:29.183
He really thought that it would develop
into this great business.

13:29.266 --> 13:32.186
[Ray] I was in embarrassment
of how much in debt I was

13:32.269 --> 13:34.939
that I was telling him
Miami Exotics is doing great.

13:35.439 --> 13:36.816
But the money is just gone.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.943
He was the one
that always extended his arm for me,

13:39.026 --> 13:41.737
and Iâ€¦ I just didn't want
to disappoint my grandfather.

13:42.613 --> 13:46.242
We had about 100,000 left. I was, like,
"Fuck it, I'll take it to the casino."

13:46.992 --> 13:50.329
"I'm gonna take all this money
and just take one last chance."

13:52.498 --> 13:54.583
I played baccarat all night.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.337
I ended up losing everything I had.

14:00.047 --> 14:02.216
Fuck it. You know, I'm gonna kill myself.

14:05.761 --> 14:08.305
I just knew he'd be so disappointed.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.515
[Pop] Raymond?

14:09.598 --> 14:11.934
[Ray] When you're depressed,
you lose sight of everything.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.853
It's a rabbit hole of shit.

14:15.229 --> 14:18.983
I remember just opening that bottle
and just chugging 'em.

14:19.066 --> 14:20.109
I took about 50,

14:20.192 --> 14:22.278
which just about anybody would die from.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.613
It's 100 milligrams of Xanax.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.908
[Kerri] He called me after he woke up.

14:28.868 --> 14:32.037
I mean, it'sâ€¦ it's heartbreaking,
you know, to seeâ€¦ see your kid like that.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.205
You know, it'sâ€¦

14:34.248 --> 14:35.457
You know, it's, umâ€¦

14:40.838 --> 14:44.425
You know, I feel sorry for him
because I felt like, you know, likeâ€¦

14:44.508 --> 14:45.676
You know, he'sâ€¦

14:45.759 --> 14:47.261
Even though he could be a little shit,

14:47.344 --> 14:49.597
you know,
he always had a vulnerability about him,

14:49.680 --> 14:52.850
even when--
No matter what he was doing, you know.

14:55.144 --> 14:58.564
No, we just-- You know, we cried.
We both cried and, you know,

14:59.231 --> 15:00.858
I just basically said,

15:01.692 --> 15:03.736
"You can figure it out.
We'll get this figured out."

15:05.070 --> 15:07.156
Like, "You know, you're really smart."

15:07.239 --> 15:10.659
[somber music playing]

15:10.743 --> 15:13.954
[Ray] I'm sitting
in Miami Exotics' office.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.081
[Bert] Ray was super upset.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.041
And thenâ€¦

15:18.667 --> 15:21.712
Sorbee came up and started talking to Ray.

15:22.963 --> 15:26.091
[Ray] Yeah, so at that point,
I just hated Sorbee completely

15:26.175 --> 15:28.093
'cause I just felt, like, so betrayed.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.640
And then he starts
talking about cryptocurrency.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.768
I'm like, "What the fuck
is this kid even talking about?"

15:35.851 --> 15:37.686
[chuckling] "What the fuck is that?"

15:38.395 --> 15:42.650
You can just see, like, the light
in his eyes, that this was something.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.401
And they came to the conclusion

15:44.485 --> 15:46.862
that it was best
to kick me out of the company,

15:47.863 --> 15:51.659
and that he would make
more money with Sorbee than with me.

15:51.742 --> 15:54.078
That's what parlayed right into Centra.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.163
[suspenseful music playing]

16:01.085 --> 16:03.212
Sorbee's actually like the idea guy.

16:03.295 --> 16:06.298
You know, he'sâ€¦ he's super good
at just coming up with ideas.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.593
Or just sitting behind a computer

16:09.677 --> 16:13.055
andâ€¦ and, you know,
knowing where to steal ideas from.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.642
One of the clear problems
with cryptocurrencies at that time

16:16.725 --> 16:18.394
was that it was hard to use them.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.939
People have gotten rich with Bitcoin,

16:22.022 --> 16:25.734
and you could not spend
your cryptocurrency.

16:26.902 --> 16:29.071
[Sorbee] Cryptocurrency started getting
really popular.

16:29.154 --> 16:32.408
And I jumped on just like everyone else
about three years ago

16:32.491 --> 16:35.244
and was trading Bitcoin
and, uh, Ethereum, etc.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.413
And then, one day,
I was just sitting home,

16:37.496 --> 16:38.789
and I was like, "You know what?"

16:38.872 --> 16:42.584
"What if I could just go spend my Bitcoins
and the profits I've made

16:42.668 --> 16:44.044
and just go buy stuff with it

16:44.128 --> 16:46.964
without having to worry
about withdrawing, depositing, et cetera?"

16:47.047 --> 16:50.759
And that's where kind of the idea
manifested for Centra Card.

16:54.221 --> 16:57.099
Our pitch to the world was
we were gonna create a debit card

16:57.182 --> 16:59.727
where you'd be able to spend
cryptocurrency in real-time,

16:59.810 --> 17:00.853
anytime, anywhere.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.771
[suspenseful music continues]

17:02.855 --> 17:05.816
We're gonna create aâ€¦
a marketplace for cryptocurrency.

17:05.899 --> 17:08.277
We're gonna have
our own exchange, our own wallet.

17:08.360 --> 17:09.903
-[beeps]
-[whirs]

17:09.987 --> 17:12.281
Basically, everything you need
in cryptocurrency,

17:12.364 --> 17:14.366
we were gonna put it in one central place.

17:15.617 --> 17:16.535
[beeps]

17:18.871 --> 17:20.122
[Popper] During the ICO boom,

17:20.205 --> 17:24.126
you had people doing
these serious projects.

17:24.209 --> 17:28.213
Kids, you know,
with PhDs from Stanford, from MIT,

17:28.297 --> 17:31.175
at the same time as you had these kids

17:31.258 --> 17:35.054
who were agents
at rental car companies in Miami,

17:35.137 --> 17:40.184
who were raising the exact same
amount of money as the PhDs from MIT,

17:40.267 --> 17:46.356
without any experience in this universe
that they were building in.

17:47.357 --> 17:49.193
And it was just too easy to do.

17:49.276 --> 17:52.988
[tense music playing]

17:53.072 --> 17:55.741
We created the basis of the whole company.

17:57.618 --> 18:01.538
First thing, we have to create a LinkedIn
and put our universities. [chuckles]

18:02.498 --> 18:03.916
[tense music continues]

18:03.999 --> 18:06.293
[keyboard clacking]

18:12.007 --> 18:13.300
We all went to Harvard.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.680
[laughs] We were trying to make ourselves
look as smart as possible.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.895
Creating the business plan
that you present to the world

18:24.978 --> 18:26.230
was the next thing.

18:26.313 --> 18:28.816
There's a company called TenX in Singapore

18:29.358 --> 18:31.026
that created a debit card,

18:31.110 --> 18:33.445
and they just raised roughly $20 million.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.740
We're like, "Let's just take that idea
and make it our own."

18:36.824 --> 18:39.076
We hired a guy on Upwork,

18:39.576 --> 18:41.620
and he just took their website

18:41.703 --> 18:45.374
and changed the word TenX
to Centra just about on every page.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.546
[tense music continues]

19:06.478 --> 19:07.688
[man] I'm a developer

19:07.771 --> 19:11.441
and worked as a freelancer
to develop Centra Tech.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.777
[gentle piano music playing]

19:16.321 --> 19:20.868
I was hired to work
as a developer for Centra project.

19:20.951 --> 19:24.621
I was like five
when I start working with computers.

19:26.456 --> 19:28.667
Some people might think I'm a genius.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.961
[both laughing]

19:31.044 --> 19:34.715
I think every problem can be solved
if you put enough effort.

19:34.798 --> 19:38.343
There is literally nothing
that can't be solved.

19:39.511 --> 19:43.599
Well, we were freelancing at that time.
Working on different projects.

19:46.059 --> 19:52.191
And one day we got a request for a number,
and we meet this guy on the phone.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.483
His name was Sam.

19:54.693 --> 19:55.694
[Sorbee] It's very simple.

19:55.777 --> 20:02.117
It's a lightning speed, real-time, uh,
crypto asset to fiat conversion system

20:02.201 --> 20:06.580
that's designed to work with an endless
amount of assets of our choice.

20:06.663 --> 20:09.041
Currently, we support eight.
We're gonna go to 12.

20:09.124 --> 20:11.084
[Martin]
And we were pretty excited for the project

20:11.168 --> 20:14.213
because that kind of technology
was not present on the market,

20:14.296 --> 20:17.090
so it was very good idea to be developed.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.760
Centrachain is going
to be our own blockchain.

20:20.677 --> 20:23.597
[interviewer] Are you guys
personally interested in crypto?

20:24.389 --> 20:26.183
-Umâ€¦
-Well, it's a trend.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.478
[keyboard clacking]

20:31.063 --> 20:34.608
Usually the people with ideas
have very little knowledge in technology

20:34.691 --> 20:36.318
or how the things are done.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.737
So we put it together.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.822
[crickets chirping]

20:42.658 --> 20:46.078
People need to understand that our product
is going to be the best, hands down.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.372
-[music ends]
-[dog panting]

20:51.667 --> 20:52.793
[slurping]

20:55.921 --> 20:57.005
[pensive music playing]

20:57.089 --> 21:02.886
[man] I was invested in Ethereum, Bitcoin,
and I made good choices.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.638
Pretty smart investments.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.182
[interviewer]
What excited you initially about it?

21:07.266 --> 21:09.810
Was this just like an investment thing,
or was it more than that?

21:10.894 --> 21:12.896
[man] Um, can I be, like, really honest?

21:13.563 --> 21:15.691
I wanted to be wealthy, right? Yeah.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.613
I wanted to make money quickly,

21:22.322 --> 21:23.323
travel the worldâ€¦

21:25.617 --> 21:27.035
be financially free.

21:30.706 --> 21:34.126
The issue at that time is,
how do you spend cryptocurrency?

21:34.793 --> 21:36.712
And I came across Centra Tech.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.631
It was exciting at the time.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.759
I was all about Centra Tech. I was like,
"Look at this, this makes sense."

21:44.344 --> 21:48.682
I was young, and as a military member,
I did not get paid that much money.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.602
I got hooked
because of the opportunity to make money.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.689
[exciting piano music playing]

21:55.772 --> 21:58.150
But then also having a utility device

21:58.233 --> 22:02.029
that would allow me to spend
my newly-acquired financial freedom.

22:07.909 --> 22:10.329
All of the technology sounded good.

22:13.081 --> 22:15.667
They had a real team
that could build that tech.

22:19.379 --> 22:22.299
They had backing from Visa and Bancorp.

22:24.509 --> 22:26.928
And there was the CEO.

22:33.060 --> 22:36.688
Michael Edwards was the one
that stuck out, big-time, for everyone.

22:39.566 --> 22:43.445
There's no technology company
or credit card company that's two people.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.155
[inspirational music playing]

22:45.238 --> 22:48.241
Michael Edwards was
a seed investor in Centra Tech.

22:48.325 --> 22:49.785
You know, he believed in our concept.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.663
You know,
he had business experience in this field.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.291
He didn't really want to be
a part of operations.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.252
He just believed in the concept
and wanted us to get going.

23:01.004 --> 23:04.633
We made him the CEO
because we didn't want anybody to see

23:04.716 --> 23:07.135
that young kids
were the owners of this company.

23:07.219 --> 23:10.680
We wanted somebody that would represent
a strong older figure.

23:12.099 --> 23:15.936
To have somebody that's, like, respectable
and presentable to the public.

23:18.897 --> 23:19.981
We had everything.

23:21.274 --> 23:23.777
How would you not be interested
in this company?

23:25.278 --> 23:28.365
Once we created the website
and launched the Slack channel,

23:28.448 --> 23:31.785
there was just an influx
of people interested so fast.

23:32.869 --> 23:35.705
[Jacob]
Slack was the direct communication portal

23:35.789 --> 23:38.250
from the founders to investors.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.588
I was interested in the metrics
that they were pushing.

23:43.672 --> 23:46.508
They're like, "You're gonna be
one of the first investors in,

23:46.591 --> 23:50.595
and that means you have the maximum amount
of benefit you can generate from this."

23:50.679 --> 23:52.848
And that's the way
that I looked at it at the time.

23:53.348 --> 23:57.060
You guys who can get into the ICO,
may be very worthwhile to do.

23:57.144 --> 24:00.021
I'm excited for Centra.
I'm gonna be buying.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.190
[man 1] And they have
a really great team behind them.

24:02.274 --> 24:05.402
[man 2] Real professional.
Seems like they have their stuff together.

24:10.031 --> 24:12.033
[beeping]

24:14.077 --> 24:15.829
[interviewer]
What'd he tell you he was doing?

24:15.912 --> 24:17.330
What did you ask about his business?

24:17.414 --> 24:21.418
You know, he would just basically
would tell me, "It's an electronic money."

24:21.501 --> 24:25.380
"And it's the currency of,
you know, the next generation."

24:25.464 --> 24:27.424
Something about Bitcoins or something?

24:28.800 --> 24:30.343
I don't even know what it is.

24:30.427 --> 24:31.428
[pensive music playing]

24:31.511 --> 24:32.846
[laughs]

24:32.929 --> 24:35.599
[beeping]

24:35.682 --> 24:37.976
You can see here
they have their token sale

24:38.059 --> 24:41.897
starting tonight at midnight.
All right, so that's coming up soon.

24:42.397 --> 24:45.317
Uh, that's why I want to get
this video out to you stat.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.903
[pensive music continues]

24:51.615 --> 24:54.034
[clock ticking]

24:54.117 --> 24:57.078
[Ray] Our ICO had been live
for a few weeks.

24:58.038 --> 25:01.583
It's not really, like,
this big success at all at first.

25:05.545 --> 25:06.463
It sucked.

25:08.465 --> 25:12.636
About a month goes by, we made ten,
twenty, fifty thousand.

25:13.345 --> 25:16.556
We're rolling. We're rolling.
Sixty, seventy, eighty thousand.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.683
[ticking rapidly]

25:19.476 --> 25:20.560
And then one night,

25:22.062 --> 25:24.272
tons of money just starts flooding in.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.107
A hundred thousand,
another hundred thousand,

25:26.191 --> 25:27.526
five hundred thousand.

25:29.194 --> 25:31.154
Within another hour, we had $2 million.

25:31.238 --> 25:34.533
We're like, "What the fuck,
is this even real? What is going on here?"

25:37.118 --> 25:39.538
[Jacob] It was pretty exciting
to watch it go up.

25:40.163 --> 25:41.831
Just watching something go up

25:41.915 --> 25:45.377
and become extremely valuable, it's like
a drug, like adrenaline hitting you.

25:45.460 --> 25:48.797
You're so excited that your investment
is making a ton of money.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.967
It brings up all these
different opportunities in your mind.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.426
"What can I do with my life now?"

25:54.553 --> 25:57.472
[Ray] Clearly there was a reason
why all this big money was coming in.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.978
People in our chat room started saying,

26:03.061 --> 26:05.021
"Clif High wrote this article.
You guys see that?"

26:05.105 --> 26:07.107
Me and Sorbee, like, jumped in there.
We're like,

26:07.190 --> 26:10.318
"Of course we know Clif High.
We love Clif High. Yeah, he's the man."

26:10.402 --> 26:11.861
We had no fucking idea who he was.

26:11.945 --> 26:15.156
The whole, uh, banking system is failing.

26:15.240 --> 26:18.326
But in theâ€¦ in the meantime,
we're all going to be dealing with

26:18.410 --> 26:21.496
real money in the form
of gold, silver, and cryptos.

26:21.580 --> 26:25.083
And the cryptos are going
to be, um, the fluid part of it.

26:25.166 --> 26:27.836
And he was, like,
a crypto guru type of guy.

26:27.919 --> 26:29.879
He's just some, like, some old nerd.

26:31.715 --> 26:34.092
He was saying
this is gonna be a big thing.

26:34.175 --> 26:37.012
He put out this press release
telling all his big investors

26:37.095 --> 26:39.097
to put out their money for Centra.

26:43.059 --> 26:45.770
We went from having, like, 200 people
in our Slack channel

26:45.854 --> 26:49.149
to having like 2,000 people
within, like, you know, a couple hours.

26:49.816 --> 26:52.694
Time to go to the stratosphere.
This company's takin' off.

26:53.486 --> 26:55.155
[printer whirring]

26:56.072 --> 26:58.074
[upbeat music playing]

27:02.912 --> 27:04.581
With ICOs,
it's like you're printing money.

27:04.664 --> 27:06.499
That's what you're doing.
You're printing money.

27:06.583 --> 27:07.876
You're allowed to print money.

27:07.959 --> 27:12.088
That moment was probably the best moment
of Centra, like, as far as feelings.

27:13.173 --> 27:16.301
It's the craziest shit to think
we were able to raise that much money

27:16.384 --> 27:18.595
with having absolutely nothing
but a website.

27:20.847 --> 27:23.099
I figured
it wasn't, like, aboveboard, right?

27:23.183 --> 27:25.852
Like, I just, I kind of
put two and two together on that.

27:25.935 --> 27:28.897
But I also, like-- You got to realize
it was very par for the course.

27:28.980 --> 27:32.609
I knew Ray was gonna be a millionaire.
Like, he's been saying it forever.

27:32.692 --> 27:35.570
Like, if he didn't,
I'd be shocked, to be honest.

27:38.281 --> 27:42.410
Even as a kid, he was just always
interested in making money.

27:42.494 --> 27:46.539
And committing crimes seemed to be,
like, his main motivating force.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.751
He has such a fucked-up moral compass.

27:49.834 --> 27:53.755
He's always, like, figuring out these
weird systems and how to manipulate them.

27:53.838 --> 27:56.966
Whether that be exploiting people
or scamming, that's who he is.

27:58.593 --> 27:59.552
They have nothing.

27:59.636 --> 28:01.846
The investors think
they have all this shit built.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.808
So, the whole thing
is to now make themselves

28:04.891 --> 28:07.560
as legitimate as possible
to secure this investment.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.021
It is a good idea, right?

28:10.563 --> 28:11.564
[footsteps approaching]

28:14.567 --> 28:15.402
[inhales]

28:16.820 --> 28:20.573
My name is Raymond Trapani,
Chief Operating Officer of Centra Tech.

28:23.201 --> 28:25.662
After the Clif High interview,
we had a few million dollars,

28:25.745 --> 28:27.414
and we're like,
"We have to get an office."

28:27.497 --> 28:30.125
The pressure was on. We needed
something to present to the world.

28:30.208 --> 28:33.086
Up until that point,
we were working in a small bedroom.

28:33.169 --> 28:36.005
We get a beautiful office.
And it was perfect.

28:36.089 --> 28:39.884
Let's give you guys a quick tour.
Hopefully, I'm still live right now.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.345
-[phone ringing]
-[Ray] Glass windows, really sleek.

28:44.973 --> 28:47.851
It just looked like a tech-based company
would live there, right?

28:48.476 --> 28:50.437
We hired roughly 50 people.

28:51.146 --> 28:55.108
[Sorbee] So this is our offices.
This is our customer support area.

28:55.191 --> 28:56.609
-Say hi, girls.
-Hi.

28:57.694 --> 29:00.739
[Ray] You have, you know, hot girls
who can do, like, assistant work.

29:00.822 --> 29:05.326
Then you can have customer service,
which also could be half hot girls. Uhâ€¦

29:05.410 --> 29:08.329
-[Sorbee] That's our COO, Raymond Trapani.
-How's everybody doing?

29:08.413 --> 29:10.623
You're hiring real developers
to build real tech.

29:10.707 --> 29:12.876
[Sorbee] This is what we call
the brain room right here.

29:12.959 --> 29:15.670
As many people know,
we work with many talented individuals.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.548
[Ray] You know, I don't think any of us
really knew what the process was.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.425
We were just
shooting at the hip from day one.

29:21.551 --> 29:24.929
The employees definitely thought
the company was fully legit.

29:25.013 --> 29:28.933
All right, we got the man, the myth,
the legend, Mr. Farkas right here. Say hi.

29:29.017 --> 29:29.976
[music stops]

29:30.059 --> 29:32.228
What's up, everybody?
This is Robert Farkas.

29:32.312 --> 29:34.481
I just wanted to give
our community an update

29:34.564 --> 29:37.192
about what we've been working
so diligently towards.

29:38.276 --> 29:40.987
When Sam originally told me
about Centra Tech,

29:41.863 --> 29:45.241
he said, "I have this new technology.
It's gonna be the future of finance."

29:45.325 --> 29:49.037
And it was probably the most exciting
thing I've ever experienced in my life.

29:49.537 --> 29:51.080
Everyone wanted to be part of it.

29:51.164 --> 29:54.709
Even if you didn't know much about crypto,
you were like, "Wow, that's really cool."

29:54.793 --> 29:58.588
"You created a debit card that connects
magic internet money to the real world?"

29:58.671 --> 30:01.299
[mellow music playing]

30:01.382 --> 30:03.343
You know, he needed help.
He needed employees.

30:03.426 --> 30:04.969
He was doing too much on his own.

30:05.053 --> 30:09.015
He was juggling a million things,
and that's when mistakes happen.

30:10.350 --> 30:12.060
I said, "I'm not a software engineer,

30:12.143 --> 30:15.313
but I can add value to the company
some way, shape, or form."

30:15.396 --> 30:18.483
Robert Farkas was
Sorbee's girlfriend's brother.

30:18.566 --> 30:21.027
We told him to quit his job
and come work for us.

30:21.110 --> 30:22.821
[interviewer]
Was he qualified to be a CFO?

30:22.904 --> 30:25.031
Definitely not qualified to be a CFO.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.200
[audience cheering]

30:27.283 --> 30:29.619
He was a stripper in his past life.

30:30.578 --> 30:31.788
[laughs]

30:33.039 --> 30:34.749
You know, once we raised enough money

30:34.833 --> 30:36.835
and we had a lot of people
in the chat rooms,

30:36.918 --> 30:39.420
we needed someone
that would just sit on there all day

30:39.504 --> 30:41.714
and just talk
to these fucking thousands of people.

30:42.215 --> 30:44.551
[Robert]
So many chats funneled into our company.

30:44.634 --> 30:46.803
We had to juggle
all these different forums.

30:46.886 --> 30:48.096
I was doing conferences,

30:48.179 --> 30:50.932
setting up booths,
getting the community involved.

30:51.432 --> 30:53.351
It felt like we were changing the world.

30:56.187 --> 30:59.440
Sam had been coding
since he was 13 years old.

30:59.524 --> 31:01.818
He was a go-getter,
a hustler, a smart kid.

31:01.901 --> 31:02.944
I think he's a genius.

31:04.779 --> 31:06.948
Sam got things set up in light speed.

31:07.031 --> 31:08.867
A speed that has never been seen before.

31:08.950 --> 31:12.662
So this is a lot of project work
that we're doing with a lot of engineers.

31:13.413 --> 31:14.873
Let's start this journey!

31:14.956 --> 31:17.333
[cheerful music playing]

31:17.417 --> 31:22.297
We have a 50,000 card order
that's being prepared for manufacturing.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.799
So mass production
is right around the corner, guys.

31:25.383 --> 31:29.053
December is ourâ€¦ our timeline
on getting these cards to you guys.

31:29.137 --> 31:30.096
[phones ringing]

31:30.179 --> 31:33.933
We promised people they would be getting
the cards out before Christmas.

31:34.017 --> 31:38.563
We figured if we could just provide that,
none of the other stuff matters.

31:40.064 --> 31:42.692
We're solving problems
on the project pretty fast.

31:43.776 --> 31:45.570
The development was speeding up.

31:46.362 --> 31:50.366
[Jonny] This shady company just graduated
to, like, the next level, right?

31:51.159 --> 31:52.327
For Sorbee,

31:52.410 --> 31:56.831
the whole thing is to now make themselves
as legitimate as possible, right?

31:56.915 --> 31:59.500
I'm a researcher
as well as my teams are researchers.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.378
[Jonny] Sorbee did a lot of research.
He fucking did it.

32:02.879 --> 32:05.673
He wants to figure it out,
like, actually do it.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.092
[cheerful music continues]

32:09.218 --> 32:11.638
[Robert] We literally stayed up
all night every night.

32:14.140 --> 32:17.060
We were just running
on adrenaline and Monsters.

32:17.143 --> 32:19.520
Yeah, we were working more than full time.

32:20.605 --> 32:23.566
I don't remember Ray
contributing much of anything.

32:25.193 --> 32:26.361
[ice clinking]

32:27.070 --> 32:29.489
He had like this little mafioso vibe.

32:29.572 --> 32:31.658
Loved gambling and loved money.

32:34.869 --> 32:36.579
And the whole time he was, um,

32:38.414 --> 32:39.248
medicated.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.088
[music fades]

32:45.171 --> 32:47.799
[Ray] My first thing,
I went and bought all beautiful suits.

32:47.882 --> 32:48.967
I bought Armani suits.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.594
I get them all tailored perfect.

32:52.178 --> 32:54.847
-How many suits did you get?
-I was in the mall every day.

32:54.931 --> 32:56.849
-Going to Saks every single day.
-Really?

32:56.933 --> 32:58.309
My suit guy just like--

32:58.393 --> 33:00.812
-[interviewer] He must have loved you.
-Yeah.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.815
We were making
about a half million dollars a day.

33:03.898 --> 33:05.483
Money just was flying in.

33:05.566 --> 33:07.944
I went from, like, having
a few hundred thousand in the bank,

33:08.027 --> 33:10.613
to just having millions
in your own personal bank account.

33:12.281 --> 33:14.283
-At 24 in Miami.
-[interviewer] Yeah.

33:15.910 --> 33:16.786
[Ray] Got a new car.

33:16.869 --> 33:18.913
-[car engine starts, revs]
-[tires screeching]

33:18.997 --> 33:22.166
We were trying to put as much money
to the side as we possibly could.

33:22.667 --> 33:26.004
You can always just cash out more.
Essentially print more money.

33:26.087 --> 33:28.673
[interviewer] It was coming in so easy
that it really didn't matter.

33:29.215 --> 33:31.801
[Ray] I remember one time during the ICO,

33:31.884 --> 33:34.554
there was this one guy
who was trying to invest,

33:34.637 --> 33:37.890
and then he gave me his password
to his whole crypto account.

33:37.974 --> 33:40.977
He meant to send me his passcode
to send the Centracoins to,

33:41.060 --> 33:42.353
and he gave me his password.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.272
And I was in this moment. I was like,

33:44.355 --> 33:46.482
"Holy shit, this guy
just gave me his password."

33:46.566 --> 33:49.110
I logged in. Couldn't help myself.
I already had made millions.

33:49.193 --> 33:51.821
This is like 100,000
sitting in his account.

33:51.904 --> 33:55.283
And what do I do here?
I just transferred it all to my account.

33:56.701 --> 34:01.330
This guy trusted me, and I felt like
I genuinely robbed this guy, you know?

34:02.874 --> 34:04.584
That was a fucked-up moment for sure.

34:05.084 --> 34:06.961
[Robert]
Ray always had a lot of cash on him.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.630
Like, he literally had it in his hoodie,
and he's dropping it,

34:09.714 --> 34:10.631
and he's, like, wasted.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.925
And everyone's like,
"What's up with this guy?"

34:13.009 --> 34:14.260
Ray was in his own world.

34:14.343 --> 34:15.678
[club music playing faintly]

34:15.762 --> 34:17.555
He just wanted to stuff his pockets.

34:17.638 --> 34:19.640
[pensive music playing]

34:26.856 --> 34:28.691
[music fades]

34:28.775 --> 34:30.777
[Ray]
It wasn't like you had to do much work

34:30.860 --> 34:32.653
to get these people to be interested.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.323
You know it's gonna be easy
to pump this company up.

34:36.282 --> 34:39.452
You know, it's really all marketing.

34:39.535 --> 34:42.080
[Sorbee] Sounds good, brother.
Thank you. All right, bye.

34:44.624 --> 34:47.168
Just spoke to fucking,
motherfucking Floyd Mayweather!

34:47.251 --> 34:48.628
[Ray laughs] Yes!

34:48.711 --> 34:49.962
[tense music playing]

34:50.046 --> 34:52.423
[reporter] Next up, we have
some pretty crazy news coming out

34:52.507 --> 34:53.966
from the Floyd Mayweather camp.

34:54.050 --> 34:56.135
[contemplative music playing]

34:56.969 --> 34:58.471
[Ray] How can we promote this company,

34:58.554 --> 35:01.432
now that we have this amount of money,
to get it to the next level?

35:02.016 --> 35:04.435
Let's get an endorsement
from a major celebrity.

35:04.519 --> 35:07.688
[Robert] This was the peak of Mayweather's
career, where he just went 50-0,

35:07.772 --> 35:09.190
and Sam was like, "I can get him."

35:09.273 --> 35:12.443
-We're like, "Get the fuck out of here."
-We know how to network, guys.

35:12.527 --> 35:15.530
We know how to be able to put
the connectivities of brands to us.

35:16.030 --> 35:18.282
Oh, what's up, champ?
How's everything, boss?

35:18.366 --> 35:21.285
He's down, and he, you know,
he obviously wants a lot of money,

35:21.369 --> 35:23.204
and we're, like, trying
to secure the deal.

35:23.287 --> 35:26.249
We ended up
somehow pitching Floyd Mayweather

35:26.332 --> 35:30.336
to take 200,000 in cash
and take 800,000 in Centracoins.

35:30.419 --> 35:33.047
You know, he's not the brightest guy,
so he accepts it.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.133
[music continues]

35:39.053 --> 35:43.391
What's up? It's the one and onlyâ€¦
your man, Floyd "Money" Mayweather.

35:45.601 --> 35:47.979
I get my card out, my Centra Card.

35:49.397 --> 35:50.356
Bitcoin.

35:51.023 --> 35:53.860
The new way things are done.
Floyd "Money" Mayweather.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.779
As y'all can see,
the number changed from before.

35:56.863 --> 36:00.408
He does a commercial,
and the commercial goes crazy for us.

36:02.118 --> 36:05.037
[Jacob] It was an amazing thing.
I mean, any good publicity

36:05.121 --> 36:07.665
that's going to pump your coin
is gonna make you more wealthy.

36:09.750 --> 36:12.503
This is a huge moment for Centra.

36:12.587 --> 36:15.006
So let's see
how they capitalize off of that.

36:15.089 --> 36:18.009
So I'm in the lab.
My man put me up on this Centra vibe.

36:18.092 --> 36:20.761
Then we secured the second
endorsement deal with DJ Khaled.

36:20.845 --> 36:23.723
The Centra vibe
is that Bitcoin, I'm sayin'.

36:23.806 --> 36:25.808
[music continues]

36:28.603 --> 36:31.272
You know, I started like that.
That's that Billy talk.

36:31.772 --> 36:34.400
[Ray] Instantly, millions of dollars
are coming in.

36:35.276 --> 36:38.279
We're making
millions of dollarsâ€¦ every day.

36:39.488 --> 36:44.160
This is such a revolutionary technology.
You can't really stop it.

36:46.329 --> 36:48.623
[Mayweather chuckles] Yes, I told y'all.

36:49.624 --> 36:53.544
Got my Centra Card. Bitcoin.
I'm doing big thing.

36:53.628 --> 36:56.172
[Popper]
When I first started covering this,

36:56.255 --> 36:57.506
my starting point was,

36:58.132 --> 37:00.092
I'm gonna look at these coins

37:00.176 --> 37:03.638
that are getting
endorsements from celebrities.

37:04.847 --> 37:06.682
It just didn't make sense.

37:07.767 --> 37:12.605
You had the people in the world who have
to know the least about technology,

37:12.688 --> 37:18.444
pretending as though they are some sort
of experts on which of these projects

37:18.527 --> 37:22.365
are the right ones for you to put
your millions of dollars into.

37:22.448 --> 37:25.368
And it was clear
they were all getting paid to do this.

37:25.451 --> 37:28.287
They have to disclose
that they're getting paid

37:28.371 --> 37:31.332
if they're gonna promote
something on social media.

37:31.415 --> 37:32.833
Somebody needs to dig into this

37:32.917 --> 37:35.169
and figure out
what the hell is going on here.

37:36.128 --> 37:38.798
This one project stood out.

37:38.881 --> 37:41.968
The Centra vibe
is that Bitcoin, I'm sayin'â€¦

37:42.593 --> 37:44.178
[keyboard clacking]

37:45.054 --> 37:46.264
[Popper] Things looked funny.

37:46.347 --> 37:48.432
[pensive music playing]

37:48.516 --> 37:51.018
You just went to their website,

37:51.602 --> 37:54.563
you scrolled down
and looked at the pictures

37:54.647 --> 37:57.692
they had of their staff and founders.

37:57.775 --> 38:00.403
The pictures didn't even
look like real people.

38:00.486 --> 38:05.283
And then they had the LinkedIn profile
for each of these employees.

38:05.366 --> 38:07.827
The ones
where the LinkedIn accounts did work,

38:07.910 --> 38:11.956
the employees all had
degrees from Harvard,

38:12.039 --> 38:15.209
and they were executives at Wells Fargo.

38:15.293 --> 38:20.339
I mean, nobody at Wells Fargo was working
in the cryptocurrency universe.

38:20.423 --> 38:23.259
It just-- None of it seemed plausible.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.595
I found these Instagram accounts

38:26.679 --> 38:31.142
that made it clear
that their LinkedIns were totally untrue

38:31.225 --> 38:34.854
and that, in fact, they worked
at some sort of car dealership.

38:34.937 --> 38:37.106
So I started digging further.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.817
[line ringing]

38:39.900 --> 38:43.112
One day, I got a call
from an author for the New York Times.

38:43.195 --> 38:46.907
"Hey, we're doing a story
on celebrities involved in crypto."

38:46.991 --> 38:48.367
So I put Ray the phone.

38:49.285 --> 38:50.578
[Ray] Hi, how you doing?

38:50.661 --> 38:52.079
[Popper] Hey, that's Ray?

38:52.747 --> 38:54.081
[Ray] Yeah, speaking. How are you?

38:54.165 --> 38:56.208
[Popper] You have a second to talk?
Endorsements--

38:56.292 --> 38:58.961
-[Ray] What company are you from?
-[Popper] The New York Times.

38:59.045 --> 39:02.131
-[Ray] All right. What's your name, sir?
-Nathaniel Popper.

39:02.631 --> 39:04.550
[Ray] You're an author
for the New York Times?

39:04.633 --> 39:06.427
[Popper] I'm a reporter
for the New York Times.

39:06.510 --> 39:10.348
I've been reporting on Bitcoin
and blockchain stuff for several years.

39:10.431 --> 39:13.100
-[Ray] So you know your stuff. I get you.
-[Popper] I'm following--

39:13.184 --> 39:16.812
[Ray] Centra, in my opinion,
is the future of cryptocurrency

39:16.896 --> 39:19.857
and the financial industry
at the same time.

39:19.940 --> 39:22.318
[Popper] Okay. Um, good, well, um--

39:22.401 --> 39:24.362
[Ray] It's gonna be able to make cards

39:24.445 --> 39:27.573
that they're able to spend
their cryptocurrency on in real time.

39:27.656 --> 39:29.784
Just like an iPhone
coming to the world in--

39:29.867 --> 39:31.243
[Popper] Um, mm-hmm.

39:31.327 --> 39:33.954
Yeah, it felt great.
New York Times? We're all from New York.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.373
You know, how can you beat that?

39:35.456 --> 39:36.457
Whoa.

39:36.540 --> 39:37.625
It was amazing.

39:37.708 --> 39:42.046
A great opportunity to get our name out
to the United States market.

39:42.129 --> 39:43.923
They want to send a photographer over.

39:44.006 --> 39:45.966
I said, "No problem.
You know, send them over."

39:46.050 --> 39:48.719
"Sorbee will come to the office,
and we'll all take these pictures."

39:50.596 --> 39:54.975
[Popper] After my first call,
I told the photographer to rush down there

39:55.059 --> 39:59.397
to get the photos before they,
sort of, second-guessed all this.

40:01.482 --> 40:03.067
And their offices actually existed.

40:04.151 --> 40:07.947
It really seemed like
this had started as a scam,

40:08.030 --> 40:10.366
and then they suddenly started to think,

40:10.449 --> 40:14.537
"You know what, maybe we'll just do this.
Maybe we'll just make a credit card."

40:14.620 --> 40:17.123
Anybody can come here to our offices.
Doors are open.

40:17.206 --> 40:19.667
You can meet the staff.
They're intelligent people.

40:20.251 --> 40:21.919
[Popper] Let's hire some programmers

40:22.002 --> 40:25.089
and put something on the blockchain,
and we'll create the next bank.

40:25.172 --> 40:29.552
Even though no part of the building blocks
that they were working from were real.

40:31.095 --> 40:33.222
[Ray] We all got, like, our best suits on.

40:33.305 --> 40:35.307
[wondrous music playing]

40:35.391 --> 40:36.267
[shutter clicks]

40:52.324 --> 40:54.452
[music fades]

40:54.535 --> 40:55.411
[car engine revving]

40:56.579 --> 40:58.080
[Kerri] Yeah, it was exciting

40:58.164 --> 41:01.500
because I saw, you know, the spiral down
after Miami Exotics,

41:01.584 --> 41:02.877
and now he's feeling good.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.254
He was making money. He was successful.

41:05.337 --> 41:08.382
[Pat] Ray came to the door.
He had a Harvard shirt on.

41:08.466 --> 41:12.261
I said, "Where did you get that?"
He says, "Oh, online." [chuckles]

41:12.344 --> 41:15.181
Then he started laughing.
He said, "I went to Harvard."

41:15.806 --> 41:18.142
"I started this big company."

41:18.809 --> 41:22.980
It was just kind of, "Okay, let's hope
that everything's gonna be okay."

41:23.481 --> 41:24.857
[car engine revving]

41:24.940 --> 41:26.942
[phone ringing]

41:28.569 --> 41:30.237
[Popper] Um, Ray?

41:30.988 --> 41:35.451
I've been coming across other questions
that have come up around Centra.

41:35.534 --> 41:37.870
The first thing is Visa has said

41:37.953 --> 41:40.873
nobody has applied to issue a Centra Card.

41:42.374 --> 41:45.586
[Ray] I mean, Iâ€¦ I know--
I know details about that.

41:45.669 --> 41:47.213
I mean, you know, I mean--

41:47.796 --> 41:51.342
But, I mean, Iâ€¦ I can't give you
direct answers on that.

41:52.510 --> 41:56.764
These guys say
that they're issuing a card with Visa.

41:56.847 --> 41:58.599
They have pictures up on their website

41:58.682 --> 42:01.185
that have cards
that have the Visa logo on it.

42:01.268 --> 42:04.063
One of the first things I did
was call Visa.

42:04.146 --> 42:07.107
They said, "We have no idea
who these guys are,

42:07.191 --> 42:10.110
and there is no record of an application."

42:10.194 --> 42:12.404
"They're gonna have to take
that off of their website."

42:13.489 --> 42:15.574
[Ray spluttering] I can'tâ€¦

42:17.117 --> 42:18.786
[Popper] Okay, I mean Visa's just saying

42:18.869 --> 42:22.248
this company Centra is not allowed
to issue a card with Visa on it.

42:22.331 --> 42:25.459
[Ray] Till we do the mass order,
they're never gonna speak on that.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.879
Anytime somebody tells you, you know,

42:28.963 --> 42:32.174
"Iâ€¦ I don't really feel comfortable
answering that question,"

42:32.258 --> 42:33.884
or, "These are questions that are veryâ€¦"

42:33.968 --> 42:37.429
[Ray] Very, very tough for me
to answer here. You know, I mean, like--

42:37.513 --> 42:40.057
â€¦you know
that there's something going on here.

42:40.140 --> 42:41.976
[pensive music playing]

42:42.059 --> 42:46.230
I was looking at this and just trying
to come up with an explanation

42:46.313 --> 42:51.443
that could sort of plausibly explain
how they had raised that kind of moneyâ€¦

42:51.527 --> 42:54.697
[Clif] And the channel is "Clif_High."

42:54.780 --> 43:00.077
â€¦when it was
so clearly fraudulent and a lie.

43:00.661 --> 43:03.330
[Ray] You know? And then
once we went public, what happened?

43:03.414 --> 43:05.457
I mean, overnight it blew up.

43:05.541 --> 43:08.085
Bang, one of the biggest guys
in crypto wrote,

43:08.168 --> 43:11.088
"Centra Tech is the best company
in the world to invest in."

43:11.171 --> 43:14.425
It got us to where we are now,
which is a big chunk of change.

43:14.508 --> 43:15.467
[Popper] Okay.

43:15.551 --> 43:18.971
A lot of corporations are gonna die.
Lots and lots of them.

43:19.054 --> 43:22.141
Along with some of the Cryptos, right? Umâ€¦

43:22.224 --> 43:26.979
Clif High understood this project
and, you know, believed in the projectâ€¦

43:27.062 --> 43:28.689
[arcade game music plays]

43:28.772 --> 43:32.359
â€¦and then realized that it was

43:33.152 --> 43:34.194
a scam.

43:34.278 --> 43:35.904
-[tense music plays]
-[printer clatters]

43:39.867 --> 43:41.201
The shit hit the fan with Clif.

43:41.285 --> 43:42.911
[Ray] The whole article was a fuck-up.

43:42.995 --> 43:45.497
Iâ€¦ I probably never even read
the fucking full article.

43:45.581 --> 43:47.082
[whirring]

43:47.166 --> 43:49.877
[Jonny] Clif High used
these things called web bots,

43:49.960 --> 43:53.255
which make AI-generated summaries
of news articles.

43:53.922 --> 43:55.758
This web bot fucked up

43:55.841 --> 43:59.803
and put Centra's name in this article
about this bank called Centra.

44:00.429 --> 44:04.892
Clif High had thought this bank was part
of them, which would have been huge news.

44:04.975 --> 44:08.687
Imagine if Bank of America, or something,
partnered with, like, Ethereum.

44:10.064 --> 44:14.443
Clif High reaches out and was like,
"Hey, I fucked up big time."

44:14.526 --> 44:17.905
Clif reaches out to us,
and he asks if we can go live with him

44:17.988 --> 44:19.490
in front of an audience.

44:19.573 --> 44:22.076
And we agree.
We agree to it. We're like, "Fuck it."

44:22.159 --> 44:25.120
Like, how bad can it go?
Sorbee's very good at talking.

44:25.204 --> 44:27.498
You know, we've had people
ask us questions so many times,

44:27.581 --> 44:28.874
and it always goes so well.

44:29.750 --> 44:32.503
And then the first thing
Sorbee says in that call isâ€¦

44:32.586 --> 44:35.798
We are one hundred percent not a scam.

44:35.881 --> 44:40.177
Starting off saying "this is not a scam"
is the most bizarre thing in the world.

44:41.220 --> 44:44.014
No one ever says that
unless it's actually a scam.

44:44.098 --> 44:46.934
Okay, that'sâ€¦ that's fine, that's fine,
but your statementsâ€¦

44:47.017 --> 44:48.477
your statements don't mean anything.

44:48.560 --> 44:51.480
You stating you're not a scam
in no way proves you're not a scam.

44:51.563 --> 44:54.733
I'm not here to scam anybody.
I wouldn't have raised $4.5 million,

44:54.817 --> 44:56.151
came on here to scam anybody.

44:56.235 --> 44:58.946
[Clif] You're listed as the Chief
Technical Officer on LinkedIn.

44:59.029 --> 45:01.782
And for some reason,
you're still using an email account

45:01.865 --> 45:04.201
from a business, uh,
that is a car dealership.

45:04.284 --> 45:05.119
[laughing]

45:05.202 --> 45:07.913
[Clif] I don't think you have
your technical, uh, shit together here.

45:08.497 --> 45:11.500
What have you got in the way of equipment?
What's your server farm like?

45:11.583 --> 45:12.793
I don't know the details of it.

45:12.876 --> 45:14.878
The tech director
that did that for me, to be honest.

45:14.962 --> 45:17.589
-I'm a startup. I haven't been--
-Jesus Christ.

45:17.673 --> 45:19.800
I've been in business
less than a year and a half.

45:19.883 --> 45:21.885
[Ray] He asked about the bank contracts.

45:21.969 --> 45:24.263
-[Clif] My question comes to this--
-[Sorbee] Bancorp Bank--

45:24.346 --> 45:25.931
Absolutely. I'm getting right to it.

45:26.014 --> 45:27.599
Bancorp Bank, they're our managers.

45:27.683 --> 45:30.018
And we go directly through
their licensing agreement.

45:30.102 --> 45:33.689
[Clif] So that locks you out of, like,
34 states instantly because of the costs.

45:33.772 --> 45:35.441
Not 34. It's 36 states.

45:35.524 --> 45:40.195
So it's aboutâ€¦ it's about 28 states.
Because there's 51, 52 states, I think.

45:40.279 --> 45:41.280
-Right?
-[laughs]

45:41.363 --> 45:42.906
[Clif] All right, guy. [laughs]

45:42.990 --> 45:45.784
I'm not good with words, okay?
Let's just make it blunt and honest.

45:45.868 --> 45:47.661
I haven't-- I just know what we're doing.

45:47.745 --> 45:49.455
You're not aâ€¦
You're not a software engineer,

45:49.538 --> 45:51.039
you're not a coder, not a blockchain--

45:51.123 --> 45:53.250
Me personally, no. And Iâ€¦ I told you that.

45:53.333 --> 45:56.253
I'm the guy who leads them
to be able to design my vision.

45:56.336 --> 45:58.881
[Clif] So Mike doesn't do shit then?
Why is he the CEO?

45:58.964 --> 46:01.925
-To be honest, he's the money dude.
-And what's his role in this?

46:02.009 --> 46:04.720
Mikeâ€¦ Mikeâ€¦
Mike was, honestly, an investor

46:04.803 --> 46:06.138
who saw my vision and said,

46:06.221 --> 46:07.973
"You know what?
I'm gonna do this for you."

46:08.056 --> 46:10.225
He gave me the opportunity
to get where I am today.

46:10.309 --> 46:12.519
We're not the brightest, smartest people.

46:12.603 --> 46:15.355
-We're not gonna sit here and say we are.
-[Clif] Why bring that up?

46:15.439 --> 46:17.649
[Sorbee] I went and did my due diligenceâ€¦

46:19.193 --> 46:23.030
I didn't wanna believe anybody in this
universe until they prove things to me,

46:23.113 --> 46:27.868
so I immediately start asking
about their alleged CEO, Michael Edwards.

46:27.951 --> 46:29.119
[line ringing]

46:29.203 --> 46:33.165
Michael Edwards, is he, um, I mean,
is he someone I can speak to?

46:33.248 --> 46:36.585
Just so I can understand, sort of,
his role and what his view of this is.

46:36.668 --> 46:40.130
[Ray] He stops by the office, you know,
once in a while to check up on things.

46:40.214 --> 46:42.925
In regards to speaking to him,
what do you wanna speak to him about?

46:43.008 --> 46:46.261
[Popper] I'm just wondering if there's
a person there that I could talk to?

46:46.345 --> 46:48.055
[Ray] Yeah,
I can probably put that together.

46:48.138 --> 46:51.266
Only in regards to, you know, being
that it's a New York Times article.

46:51.350 --> 46:54.978
[Popper] I mean, you had him as your CEO.
Is he still your CEO?

46:55.062 --> 46:59.691
[Ray] He's more of our original money guy
before we got everything in place.

46:59.775 --> 47:01.401
[pensive music playing]

47:01.485 --> 47:04.196
There was so much heat on us
that we knew we're just trying to remove

47:04.279 --> 47:07.157
everything that was fake,
every misrepresentation, all at once.

47:07.241 --> 47:10.035
[pensive music continues]

47:15.958 --> 47:17.626
We gotta clear all the Fufu.

47:17.709 --> 47:20.003
[enchanting music playing]

47:20.087 --> 47:21.839
Fugazi, fake stuff. [chuckles]

47:23.340 --> 47:25.801
Bancorp was the bank
that we had listed on our website.

47:25.884 --> 47:28.971
They faked that too, so I would
just get out while I still could.

47:29.638 --> 47:33.058
[Robert] For the prototype card,
Sam used Bancorp prepaid cards.

47:33.141 --> 47:35.686
So he was like,
"Fuck it. Let's just say Bancorp."

47:35.769 --> 47:37.271
Because technically, it was Bancorp.

47:37.354 --> 47:38.313
[Sorbee] Approved.

47:39.314 --> 47:41.650
[Robert] And one day,
we got a cease and desist

47:41.733 --> 47:42.985
from the Bancorp Bank.

47:46.738 --> 47:48.448
It was pretty nerve-wracking.

47:51.910 --> 47:55.122
Sam found a law firm called Pope and Dunn.

47:57.374 --> 48:01.169
They were a super reputable firm
out of New York on Water Street.

48:01.879 --> 48:04.214
Eric Pope was this ex-SEC attorney.

48:04.298 --> 48:05.132
[phone ringing]

48:05.215 --> 48:07.593
A smart, witty guy on the phone.

48:07.676 --> 48:10.512
He said, "Listen,
I'm gonna handle all your legal stuff."

48:10.596 --> 48:14.516
You know, he consoled us about any hiccups
that we had early on in the company.

48:15.058 --> 48:18.061
[Eric] We're definitely on top of it.
We have the best legal team on top of it.

48:19.521 --> 48:22.065
[Robert]
We sent the cease and desist to Eric Pope.

48:22.149 --> 48:25.944
"Eric, what do we do?"
He said, "Just take it off your website."

48:26.028 --> 48:29.239
"Don't worry about it. Just abide by
the cease and desist and keep moving."

48:31.283 --> 48:34.745
[Jacob] I started noticing that things
were changing on their website.

48:35.245 --> 48:37.873
Bancorp disappeared off their white paper.

48:37.956 --> 48:38.957
Why is that gone?

48:40.083 --> 48:41.001
What's going on here?

48:41.084 --> 48:43.420
Where's the technology
that you're promising?

48:45.964 --> 48:47.966
[music fades]

48:48.050 --> 48:49.468
[crickets chirping]

48:49.551 --> 48:51.845
[Sorbee] We have reasons
we don't disclose certain things.

48:51.929 --> 48:54.890
We have technology to protect.
Our technology is our backbone.

48:54.973 --> 48:57.100
Without our technology,
we don't have a product.

48:57.184 --> 49:00.354
Our goal is not to not be transparent.
Because we understand

49:00.437 --> 49:02.689
how cryptocurrency
can take non-transparency

49:02.773 --> 49:04.816
and run with it as a scam, so we get that.

49:04.900 --> 49:06.902
[suspenseful music playing]

49:08.779 --> 49:10.614
[Ray] Everything that
we would go back to, like,

49:10.697 --> 49:12.449
when we'd get caught
into something was like,

49:12.532 --> 49:14.660
"Oh yeah, it's great
we have Michael Edwards

49:14.743 --> 49:16.453
to rely on for all this advice,

49:16.536 --> 49:18.497
and he's really bringing
our vision to life here."

49:18.580 --> 49:20.832
So I'm gonna go back to reading
some of the questions

49:20.916 --> 49:23.919
to see what people have been asking.
So I'm just gonna scroll up top.

49:24.002 --> 49:26.713
[contemplative music continues]

49:28.465 --> 49:30.842
[Ray] Of course,
people wanted to meet Michael Edwards.

49:30.926 --> 49:32.177
[exhales]

49:39.893 --> 49:43.230
People would come into our chats
talking shit. Just talk and talk.

49:43.313 --> 49:46.400
"When are you gonna have Michael Edwards
come on and talk to everybody?

49:46.483 --> 49:48.902
"Did he work here?
Did he go to this college?"

49:48.986 --> 49:51.571
"Is there somebody named Michael Edwards

49:51.655 --> 49:55.575
who lives in Miami,
who is this age, who has this picture?"

49:55.659 --> 49:59.121
[man]
Where is the alleged co-founder and CEO?

49:59.204 --> 50:00.414
"Michael Edwards."

50:01.081 --> 50:04.334
That's when weâ€¦ we really knew
that we had to get rid of Michael Edwards

50:04.418 --> 50:05.335
as soon as possible.

50:05.419 --> 50:07.462
[contemplative music continues]

50:21.143 --> 50:24.021
[dramatic music plays]

50:24.104 --> 50:25.480
Stupid mistake.

50:25.981 --> 50:27.983
[contemplative music continues]

50:30.777 --> 50:32.237
[Ray] Put out a press release.

50:32.904 --> 50:35.824
Michael Edwards, our CEO,
died in a car accident.

50:35.907 --> 50:38.785
It was a crazy, terrible car accident.
God bless the dead.

50:38.869 --> 50:40.579
And, you know, that was that.

50:46.001 --> 50:47.044
[music ends]

50:48.253 --> 50:50.255
[footsteps approaching]

50:56.636 --> 50:57.471
Hello.

50:58.096 --> 50:59.431
I'm Michael Edwards,

50:59.514 --> 51:02.309
founder and CEO of Centra Tech.

51:04.144 --> 51:06.480
[interviewer] Is that, uh,
who you really are?

51:07.522 --> 51:09.399
No, that's not who I really am.

51:10.025 --> 51:14.112
I'm Dr. Andrew Halayko. I'm a professor
at the University of Manitoba.

51:14.905 --> 51:19.785
"On August 25th,
Michael Edwards suddenly left this world."

51:19.868 --> 51:22.871
"He leaves behind
his French bulldog, Stanley,

51:23.538 --> 51:26.875
and an accomplished career
as an investor and VP

51:26.958 --> 51:28.543
for Wells Fargo and Chase."

51:28.627 --> 51:32.506
"He graduated with an MBA
from Harvard University,

51:32.589 --> 51:36.301
which prepared him
for his most recent venture as co-founder

51:36.384 --> 51:41.098
and chief executive officer
of Centra Tech in Miami Beach, Florida."

51:42.724 --> 51:44.017
That's pretty creepy.

51:44.101 --> 51:45.560
Uhâ€¦ [chuckles]

51:46.728 --> 51:48.688
Wow. Well, at least I had an MBA,

51:48.772 --> 51:51.858
and I wasâ€¦
I was well-trained at Harvard. [chuckles]

51:51.942 --> 51:55.612
I hadn't realized that they had
actually gone to that extent.

51:55.695 --> 51:56.530
Umâ€¦

51:57.405 --> 52:01.118
Michael Edwards was never
even a real person, not at all.

52:02.369 --> 52:04.412
We completely created him from scratch.

52:04.996 --> 52:07.207
The photos for Michael Edwards
were just taken off Google.

52:07.290 --> 52:09.000
We just looked up "old white guyâ€¦"

52:09.668 --> 52:10.877
[keyboard clacking]

52:10.961 --> 52:14.005
â€¦looked at all the images,
and found an old white guy. [laughing]

52:14.589 --> 52:17.467
And just took that image,
and, you know, that was Michael Edwards.

52:18.510 --> 52:19.553
[chuckles]

52:19.636 --> 52:21.805
[pensive music playing]

52:21.888 --> 52:24.724
[Dr. Halayko] It's infuriating
that you are being manipulated

52:25.225 --> 52:27.978
and used to someone else's benefit.

52:28.937 --> 52:31.439
[Ray]
After Michael Edwards was killed off,

52:31.523 --> 52:34.025
what we were trying to do
is find a new CEO.

52:35.777 --> 52:39.698
And that's where we asked my grandfather
if he wanted to be the CEO of the company.

52:39.781 --> 52:42.242
And at the time, he had cancer,
so, like, he really didn't care.

52:42.325 --> 52:44.286
He was like, "Fuck it.
Yeah, just put me up there."

52:44.369 --> 52:45.871
You know, we took his picture.

52:47.539 --> 52:49.416
And we had a new CEO.

52:49.499 --> 52:51.209
[suspenseful music playing]

53:01.636 --> 53:05.515
[Popper] Um, so look, since we last spoke,

53:05.599 --> 53:10.061
the original CEO, Michael Edwards, um,
his picture was the picture

53:10.145 --> 53:13.440
of this guy from Canada
who wasn't named Michael Edwards.

53:13.523 --> 53:17.527
I saw that you deleted the original
LinkedIn profile that he had up.

53:17.611 --> 53:18.862
[Ray] You see, that's the thing.

53:18.945 --> 53:21.364
[spluttering]
He wanted to be a ghost investor.

53:21.448 --> 53:24.910
[Popper] But that LinkedIn profile
disappeared then, right?

53:25.493 --> 53:28.246
[Ray] Whenâ€¦ When was that?
I'm notâ€¦ I'm not even sure about that.

53:28.330 --> 53:30.832
-[Popper] There was a LinkedIn--
-[Ray] I just have one question.

53:30.916 --> 53:34.044
Whereâ€¦ Where are you getting at with theâ€¦
like, theâ€¦ the end point of this?

53:34.127 --> 53:34.961
[Popper] Umâ€¦

53:35.545 --> 53:37.422
[Jacob] After Michael Edwards passed,

53:37.505 --> 53:39.883
I needed to know who William Hagner was.

53:41.426 --> 53:44.763
I researched the founders,
whatever I could find.

53:44.846 --> 53:46.973
[keyboard clacking]

53:48.850 --> 53:52.229
I started looking into Raymond Trapani
and his entire background

53:52.312 --> 53:54.105
on his Facebook page.

53:56.316 --> 53:58.526
Wow, what is this?

53:59.027 --> 54:01.905
William Hagner
is actually Raymond's grandfather.

54:02.739 --> 54:04.407
It was very suspicious.

54:07.661 --> 54:09.955
I was sounding the alarm
in the Slack channel.

54:10.038 --> 54:10.872
[keyboard clacking]

54:12.707 --> 54:14.417
[Robert] We were getting some backlash.

54:15.669 --> 54:18.046
There was always, like, a troll
that we had to shut up.

54:18.588 --> 54:20.090
People say they don't have a CEO.

54:20.173 --> 54:24.261
There's a few other things that people
think there's a fraud involved here.

54:24.344 --> 54:27.055
[Jacob] There was a post
on a YouTube channel

54:27.138 --> 54:29.683
breaking down everything on the website
that didn't make sense.

54:29.766 --> 54:32.978
I'm not too concerned
about YouTube and Reddit.

54:33.061 --> 54:34.562
We're not gonna engage with this.

54:34.646 --> 54:35.814
[Jacob] When that came out,

54:35.897 --> 54:39.359
Centra Tech offered money
to take this down,

54:39.442 --> 54:42.362
and then he took that,
and he posted it onto Slack.

54:44.239 --> 54:48.076
It's like, "Hey look. I just got offered
by them money to take this down."

54:50.078 --> 54:51.830
[suspenseful music continues]

54:51.913 --> 54:56.293
[Robert] Every day there was somebody
spreading FUD in all our chats.

54:56.376 --> 54:58.211
Fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

54:59.796 --> 55:03.591
And a lot of these trolls, we actually
turned them into Centra believers.

55:04.551 --> 55:06.886
[interviewer] Was that by paying them?

55:06.970 --> 55:09.180
Did you pay them
to remove unfavorable posts?

55:10.390 --> 55:11.975
I don't know about that. [laughs]

55:12.058 --> 55:14.477
[Ray] We were paying people off all day.
That's all we did.

55:14.561 --> 55:17.480
"I know this is all bullshit,
but here's, you know, twenty grand."

55:17.564 --> 55:19.316
"Can you fucking take this shit down?"

55:20.442 --> 55:22.193
[Jacob] "Where did your partnerships go?"

55:22.277 --> 55:24.738
"Where is the actual proof
that this works?"

55:25.405 --> 55:29.617
And as I continue to push that, uh,
people were getting upset.

55:29.701 --> 55:31.494
I feel bad for you guys.

55:31.578 --> 55:33.496
You guys have nothing better to do
with your lives

55:33.580 --> 55:35.790
than try to troll a company.

55:35.874 --> 55:38.585
[Jacob] They were basically saying,
"Oh, I'm spreading FUD."

55:39.085 --> 55:40.503
[Ray] Anytime that's in a chat room,

55:40.587 --> 55:43.381
you're just trying to get that out
of the chat room as fast as possible.

55:43.465 --> 55:45.842
You know, some people,
you can just tell right off the bat

55:45.925 --> 55:47.177
they're not gonna be bought.

55:47.260 --> 55:49.971
And they decided
it would just be worth it to ban me

55:50.055 --> 55:51.848
so I could no longer spread FUD.

55:54.184 --> 55:56.436
I was extremely angry.

55:56.519 --> 55:57.645
These people are awful.

55:57.729 --> 55:59.731
[tense music playing]

56:13.828 --> 56:17.582
I was aâ€¦ I was aâ€¦a dirtbag
when I was younger.

56:17.665 --> 56:20.085
More like a Raymond Trapani, if you will.

56:21.169 --> 56:23.797
A lot changed
when I went on my first deployment

56:23.880 --> 56:25.507
and experienced what I did.

56:27.300 --> 56:28.385
[shell casing clinks]

56:28.468 --> 56:29.719
I was in Afghanistan.

56:30.804 --> 56:33.556
Loss takes you aback,

56:33.640 --> 56:36.101
and you really have to question,
what are you here for?

56:36.768 --> 56:40.355
It just changed, uh, everythingâ€¦
pretty quickly.

56:41.898 --> 56:45.360
We all have to grow at some point
to have something to live for

56:45.443 --> 56:46.444
other than money.

56:47.153 --> 56:49.489
It can buy you a lot of things,
but at the end of the day,

56:49.572 --> 56:54.327
theâ€¦ the person that you were in life
will outlive the money that you have.

56:56.704 --> 56:58.039
After I got banned,

56:58.957 --> 57:01.501
I became obsessed with Centra and, uh,

57:02.669 --> 57:04.504
absolutely wanted to take them down.

57:05.088 --> 57:06.047
[gun fires]

57:09.676 --> 57:12.137
Yeah, it was a personal vendetta
at that point.

57:12.220 --> 57:14.222
[tense music continues]

57:20.979 --> 57:24.816
[man on video] So the two main guys
who recently completed the Centra ICO,

57:24.899 --> 57:28.278
they're basically just scam artists.
So be careful.

57:29.154 --> 57:32.365
[Ray] You know, day-to-day, there would be
people making YouTube videos

57:32.449 --> 57:36.077
about how Centra is doing this wrong,
and these contracts aren't real.

57:36.161 --> 57:39.330
You know, at that moment
I remember just thinking in my head, like,

57:39.414 --> 57:40.957
this is the end of it.

57:43.960 --> 57:46.588
And, out of nowhereâ€¦

57:46.671 --> 57:49.299
[hopeful music playing]

57:52.927 --> 57:54.596
â€¦fucking South Korea.

58:02.770 --> 58:05.648
[Robert] Bitsset, a South Korean company.

58:08.443 --> 58:11.112
There wasn't a lot
of information about them,

58:11.196 --> 58:12.822
but we knew they had a lot of money.

58:12.906 --> 58:17.160
They loved Centra Tech, and they wanted
to help us grow in the Asian market.

58:17.827 --> 58:20.330
[Ray] They'll invest
five million dollars upfront,

58:20.413 --> 58:23.666
and then you guys will come to Korea
and show us proof of concept,

58:23.750 --> 58:25.251
and then we'll invest the rest.

58:25.752 --> 58:28.046
So they invested five million.

58:28.129 --> 58:30.006
And from there, we're like,

58:30.089 --> 58:33.843
"All right, we're going to fly down
to Korea and get the shit going." Soâ€¦

58:34.719 --> 58:37.597
[interviewer] You were like,
"We have to have an app now."

58:38.848 --> 58:39.974
[uplifting music playing]

58:40.058 --> 58:41.017
[Ray] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:41.100 --> 58:44.270
We had already created
a fake app for other presentations,

58:44.854 --> 58:48.775
so that we could make a video
and show that on the app, "Oh, lookâ€¦"

58:48.858 --> 58:50.360
[whirs, beeps]

58:50.443 --> 58:54.113
"The correct amount of Bitcoin
is being removed after I swipe my card."

58:56.783 --> 58:58.493
But we needed a better fake app.

58:58.576 --> 59:00.578
[gentle music playing]

59:02.288 --> 59:06.709
We were given task. "Can you create us
interface when we press a button,

59:06.793 --> 59:08.878
that it proves the concept that works?"

59:08.962 --> 59:11.506
We were building
the application with the deadline.

59:11.589 --> 59:15.218
At that one moment they told us they will
go to Korea to test the application.

59:15.301 --> 59:17.887
They were worried about will this work.

59:19.472 --> 59:24.310
To prove the concept that works, he had
people in-house to enter data manually.

59:25.812 --> 59:27.772
I'm not sure you can count it as fake.

59:28.815 --> 59:31.526
It was working but not scalable.

59:32.610 --> 59:33.945
It's just a prototype.

59:35.113 --> 59:37.824
[Ray] We put our whole technology team.

59:37.907 --> 59:39.742
We took their focus off the real app

59:40.243 --> 59:42.620
and made them
focus on building a fake appâ€¦

59:44.455 --> 59:47.959
that would work in real-time
when Sorbee was going to Korea.

59:48.459 --> 59:50.837
[interviewer] Why not have them
keep focusing on the real app?

59:50.920 --> 59:51.838
[laughs]

59:51.921 --> 59:54.716
I was just sitting there like,
"Oh shit, Korea."

59:54.799 --> 59:56.217
[gentle music continues]

01:00:00.388 --> 01:00:01.848
[Ray] I was not going to South Korea.

01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:04.517
I don't really like
going into foreign territories

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:07.812
when, you know, you're not doing
something that's legitimate.

01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:13.109
Sounds risky. [sighs]

01:00:13.192 --> 01:00:14.652
We send Sorbee.

01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:17.155
[Robert] He was like,
"Hold down the office. I'm out of here."

01:00:17.238 --> 01:00:19.449
He just jumped on a flight
and went there by himself.

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:22.035
They don't have dick.

01:00:22.535 --> 01:00:25.330
So they make an app
that charges your debit card

01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:28.082
and makes it seem like
it's spending your crypto directly.

01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:29.334
[Ray] We take that debit card.

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:32.253
We send it to a guy in California,
made it into a metal Centra Card.

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:34.964
Now we have this metal Centra Card
that when we swipe it,

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:36.966
it just takes money from our bank account.

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:40.970
We would just press a button
so that it presents as it's a real app

01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:42.305
and it's working correctly.

01:00:42.388 --> 01:00:46.684
So on our end, we just had to do
all those transactions behind the scenes.

01:00:46.768 --> 01:00:50.188
So we're going to transfer
that value that you guys, you knowâ€¦

01:00:50.271 --> 01:00:51.898
[Ray] So now he's down in Korea.

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:53.066
â€¦we're also going toâ€¦

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:55.360
[Ray] Now he has to do
a filmed presentation

01:00:55.443 --> 01:00:57.111
in front of their team.

01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:02.575
I believe that a partnership
with Centra Tech and Bitsset

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.410
will be powerful in the Asian market

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:07.038
as well as promotion
of cryptocurrencies worldwide.

01:01:07.121 --> 01:01:09.540
[man in Korean]
When you search Centra on the internet,

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:11.876
many people say it's a scam.

01:01:11.959 --> 01:01:14.087
Why do they think that?

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:17.131
And what are your thoughts
regarding the accusation?

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:21.511
[Sorbee in English] A lot of
the accusations came from competitors

01:01:21.594 --> 01:01:23.971
that felt that our product was a threat.

01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:27.350
The Centra Card is the world's
best cryptocurrency debit card.

01:01:27.433 --> 01:01:29.102
These accusations are false.

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:30.561
It was pretty stressful. [chuckles]

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:34.107
[Ray] He was all excited.
He got his game face on.

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:37.694
Hyping him up though text messages,
"You got this, you're gonna kill it."

01:01:37.777 --> 01:01:40.738
[Robert] This was his audition
to, like, lock in this company

01:01:40.822 --> 01:01:42.281
andâ€¦ and seal the deal.

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:44.492
[indistinct chatter]

01:01:46.327 --> 01:01:48.705
When he's doing
the presentation with Bitssetâ€¦

01:01:53.918 --> 01:01:55.586
[tense music playing]

01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:56.879
â€¦we press the buttonâ€¦

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:03.010
and it didn't correct on the app.

01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:04.971
It didn't work at all.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:07.974

01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:12.103
I was sweating.

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:14.564
[Ray] And then we lost contact.

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.650
[Robert] We have no idea what's going on.

01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:20.403
[Ray] What the fuck is going on?

01:02:20.486 --> 01:02:21.779
[clock ticking]

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:26.284
Three hours pass, and we're in shock.
We're like, "Fuck."

01:02:26.367 --> 01:02:28.828
[Robert] We're over here
hoping he makes it out alive.

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:32.415
Is he gonna be killed?
We thought he was dead.

01:02:32.498 --> 01:02:36.085

[music fades]

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:48.055

[cellphone chimes]

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.769
"Yo. That shit didn't work."

01:02:54.645 --> 01:02:57.190
"But, um, they're still gonna invest."

â™ª First off let me sayâ€¦ â™ª

01:03:09.702 --> 01:03:13.414
That same day, they invested
another $15 million in our company.

â™ª Rep the coast but still it for the bay â™ª

01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:21.172

â™ª If you thinkin' that I need you

01:03:28.721 --> 01:03:30.348

[song ends]

01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:07.927
[Popper] In a sense,
Centra was the story of crypto itself,

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:12.723
which is an endeavor
that has something real underneath it,

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:17.478
but keeps failing
and keeps running into problems.

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:20.314
And yet, people keep coming back to it.

01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:26.529
There's something so alluring there
that people can't give up on the promise.

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:31.284
Andâ€¦ And part of that promise
is just the simple one

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:33.244
that you can get rich quickly.

01:04:34.328 --> 01:04:36.122
[Ray] We had that ICO
at such a perfect time.

01:04:36.205 --> 01:04:38.040
Everyday Ethereum was going up in price,

01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:40.334
and every day they're investing
that Ethereum into Centra.

[ethereal music playing]

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:10.656
[Popper] The strangest thing to me

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.576
is that neither of you
have any experience in blockchain.

01:05:13.659 --> 01:05:15.578
How did you decide
to go into this business?

01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:18.998
[Ray] Me and Sam have been, you know,
kind of little nerds since we were young.

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:21.083
You know, we always loved computers
and whatnot.

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:22.335
[Popper] I kept thinking

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:24.754
that once I started asking
harder questions,

01:05:24.837 --> 01:05:28.758
they were gonna shut down and realize
this was not going to be good for them.

[popcorn popping]

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:36.057

to believe their own excuses.

And we all kind of read it
at the same time,

and we all said this is not good.

01:06:10.174 --> 01:06:13.052

Right afterwards, I sold everything
because I knew that there was no more.

with more than a few problems,

01:08:16.425 --> 01:08:21.013
[Ray] He's dumb, naive, all of the above.
He was just a yes-man, right?

01:08:21.097 --> 01:08:24.892
He had no experience in any sort of thing
that required you to use your brain.

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:25.935
Fuck him.

01:08:27.144 --> 01:08:28.854
I think just speaking to Ray

01:08:29.438 --> 01:08:31.774
pissed him off even more
because he realized that

01:08:32.983 --> 01:08:34.610
he's not aâ€¦ a good guy.

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:39.782
[music fades]

01:08:39.865 --> 01:08:42.076
[man] The New York Times article
was really important.

01:08:42.159 --> 01:08:44.203
When things get
that kind of public attention,

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:47.248
and there's that big of a question
about whether something's real,

01:08:47.331 --> 01:08:49.333
and when people
are raising a lot of money,

01:08:49.416 --> 01:08:50.835
that makes the SEC interested.

01:08:50.918 --> 01:08:53.712
There was an aspect
of Centra that was really brazen.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:58.676
They were saying things that did not take
a lot of work to prove were not true,

01:08:58.759 --> 01:09:01.512
like relationships
with credit card companies and banks.

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:04.807
Using photos of fake people
with fake biographies

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:07.518
and thinking that
that was going to work long term.

01:09:07.601 --> 01:09:10.896
It's just hard to understand
how anyone would think that would work.

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:12.231
And maybe they were joking,

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:15.276
but to make up a story
that the CEO died in an accidentâ€¦

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:20.072
that that would work,
itâ€¦ it's just hard to imagine.

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:23.033
We are fully on board
with any regulatory bodies

01:09:23.117 --> 01:09:24.869
to make sure everything's done correctly.

01:09:24.952 --> 01:09:28.747
Centra's here to last for a long time.
We're doing everything we can by the book.

01:09:29.373 --> 01:09:32.877
[Ray] Centra was completely
illegitimate nonsense at first.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.337
But once we started
generating millions of dollars,

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:38.132
we saw that there was actually
a chance to go fully legit.

01:09:38.215 --> 01:09:40.384
[Robert] We needed a good lawyer
to help us get there.

01:09:40.467 --> 01:09:41.302
[phone ringing]

01:09:41.385 --> 01:09:43.804
The main thing we had Eric Pope work on

01:09:43.888 --> 01:09:46.974
was making sure
that Centracoins weren't securities.

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:51.270
Because we didn't want to be
in hot water with the SEC.

01:09:56.066 --> 01:09:57.735
Our secretary got the mail,

01:09:57.818 --> 01:10:01.447
and there was
a 500-page subpoena from the SEC.

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:04.700
We're a company that wants to comply, um,

01:10:04.783 --> 01:10:08.037
with the laws and regulations
here in the United States.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:11.165
That's when we hired
in-house counsel, Allan Shutt.

01:10:11.248 --> 01:10:13.709
General Counsel and
Chief Compliance Officer at Centra Tech.

01:10:13.792 --> 01:10:18.214
Allan Shutt started asking questions
about who our legal counsel was.

01:10:18.297 --> 01:10:20.466
And we told him, "Hey, listen,
it's this guy Eric Pope

01:10:20.549 --> 01:10:22.218
from Water Street in Manhattan."

01:10:22.301 --> 01:10:25.763
[Ray] "Who has, like, 20 years
of business experience as a lawyer."

01:10:25.846 --> 01:10:29.516
[Robert] "His website's beautiful.
He's quick on the phone. He's perfect."

01:10:30.267 --> 01:10:31.143
Uhâ€¦

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:33.812
And he said,
"Okay, I can't find his bar license."

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.107
"What do you mean?"

01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:38.400
Umâ€¦

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:41.695
And he said, "This guy's a fraudster."
"What are you talking about?"

01:10:42.696 --> 01:10:43.864
"It's a scam."

01:10:44.365 --> 01:10:49.411
Eric Pope ended up being
a college kid from Virginiaâ€¦

01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:51.413
-Hey, are you going to the party later?
-[exhales]

01:10:51.997 --> 01:10:53.582
-Uhâ€¦ No.
-Okay.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.834
[Robert] â€¦named John Lambert.

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:58.504
[gun firing in video game]

01:10:59.672 --> 01:11:03.634
I see Donald Trump
as reviving the Republican Party.

01:11:04.593 --> 01:11:07.388
[Robert] And he was one of the founders
of Students for Trump.

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:11.141
[Ray] He was in college.
You know, weâ€¦ we paid him.

01:11:12.142 --> 01:11:14.937
And so we got finessed
by this young college kid

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:18.774
into believing
we were abiding by the SEC's rules.

01:11:18.857 --> 01:11:20.067
[phone ringing]

01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:23.654
Just take it off your website and abide by
the cease-and-desist, no problem.

01:11:24.363 --> 01:11:25.614
You're a utility token.

01:11:26.198 --> 01:11:29.743
Most companies start with a vision,
and they build it into a reality.

01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:32.746
[Robert] All the emails he sent us
with the SEC were fake.

01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:35.582
Everything wasâ€¦ was a lie.

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:37.543
It was, like, this young kidâ€¦ [laughs]

01:11:37.626 --> 01:11:38.460
Fucking maniac.

01:11:38.544 --> 01:11:42.298
My partner thought it was a legit lawyer
the whole time he was talking to him,

01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:45.884
and he basically scammed a company
that was already scamming.

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:47.428
-It was--
-[man] Double scamming.

01:11:47.511 --> 01:11:50.306
-He was scamming the scammer, huh?
-Yeah, crazy.

01:11:54.101 --> 01:11:56.854
[Cohen] The SEC will build
the foundation of the case,

01:11:56.937 --> 01:12:00.983
and then the FBI and Department of Justice
sort of takes that foundation,

01:12:01.066 --> 01:12:02.943
and then they go forward
on the criminal side.

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:07.156
[man] I read Nathaniel Popper's
New York Times article,

01:12:07.239 --> 01:12:11.118
where there's a photo
of the three co-founders of Centra Tech.

01:12:11.201 --> 01:12:14.455
And they're in these snazzy suits,
and they look very happy.

01:12:14.538 --> 01:12:18.208
It's like giving a middle finger
to the FBI and saying, "Come get me."

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:23.005
There was rampant fraud
going on in this market.

01:12:23.088 --> 01:12:24.840
Way, way too many cases.

01:12:24.923 --> 01:12:29.386
We were just looking for what are
the most egregious examples of conduct,

01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:31.889
where we need to send aâ€¦
a message to the market.

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:35.351
When you're sitting there as a prosecutor,
your first thought is,

01:12:35.434 --> 01:12:37.311
"Maybe there's an explanation
for some of this."

01:12:37.394 --> 01:12:38.896
"Maybe they did have a license."

01:12:38.979 --> 01:12:41.231
"Maybe Mike Edwards is a real person."

01:12:41.815 --> 01:12:43.734
[anchor] Basically,
he got compensation to promote

01:12:43.817 --> 01:12:46.528
this initial coin offering
and didn't disclose it.

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:50.949
[Cohen] The SEC filed complaints
against DJ Khaled and Floyd Mayweather.

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:54.244
They had to give back the money
they'd been paid for these promotions.

01:12:54.328 --> 01:12:55.871
They also paid penalties.

01:12:56.497 --> 01:13:01.210
After that, Centra started taking actions
to try and hide things right away.

01:13:01.293 --> 01:13:02.961
Money started going out of accounts.

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:05.923
And that really accelerated
everything coming apart.

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:09.760
-[interviewer] Were you nervous, man?
-Nah, nothing really fazed me at all.

01:13:09.843 --> 01:13:12.679
I had so many--
Xanax makes you not really feel anything.

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:18.102
[Jacob] One day, I got messaged.

01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:22.815
"Hey, do you know of Centra Tech?
We're gonna file a lawsuit."

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:27.736
I ended up contacting them and saying,
"Hey, listen, I collected all this data."

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:30.739
And Iâ€¦ I presented all the information.

01:13:30.823 --> 01:13:32.658
And they said,
"Hey, you're the right guy."

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:35.119
"Would you represent
this class action lawsuit?"

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:38.622
I did accept the role
of becoming the lead plaintiff.

01:13:38.705 --> 01:13:40.999
[dramatic music playing]

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:44.086
The SEC would eventually
use our information

01:13:44.169 --> 01:13:47.214
from our lawsuit to take down Centra Tech.

01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:50.342
[Cohen] The SEC worked together
with the Department of Justice

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:53.762
to put together a case so that the FBI
could go arrest these guys.

01:13:54.763 --> 01:13:58.767
This was the first big,
high-profile fraud case

01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:01.228
that the SEC brought
in the cryptocurrency world.

01:14:03.772 --> 01:14:06.275
[Ray] When the SEC investigation
was going onâ€¦

01:14:07.901 --> 01:14:12.573
me and Sorbee were fighting over debt
that we had made from Miami Exotics.

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:15.534
I go to Sorbee, and I'm like,

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:18.036
"Yo, we have to take, you know,
half a million dollars,

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:20.330
pay off all this debt
that I had sitting there."

01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:23.709
I just wanted to pay that all off
because it was all in my family's name.

01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:27.379
Let's take, you know $500,000 in Ethereum.
I'll cash it out,

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:30.549
pay all my family's debt
that we had built together.

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:31.467
Only fair.

01:14:32.342 --> 01:14:34.052
I wanted it to come from Centra.

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:35.846
He says, "Yo, go fuck yourself."

01:14:35.929 --> 01:14:38.891
I almost got in a fistfight
with him, like, in the office.

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:42.936
If Sorbee had paid that debt,
I swear I would have never fucked him.

01:14:44.188 --> 01:14:46.982
I stepped down from the company.
I was like, "Fuck you."

01:14:48.525 --> 01:14:52.196
I just started cashing out
millions of dollars in Centracoin myself.

01:14:52.696 --> 01:14:56.200
I mean, it was bad.
You know, everything was crazy.

01:14:56.742 --> 01:15:01.580
Bill, Pop, knew nothing about everything
that was going on, how bad it was.

01:15:03.081 --> 01:15:05.417
[Kerri] He was very sick.
He was having chemotherapy.

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:06.752
He had brain surgery.

01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:09.379
[music ends]

01:15:10.047 --> 01:15:11.798
My father died in the middle of it.

01:15:14.092 --> 01:15:16.094
[somber music playing]

01:15:17.429 --> 01:15:19.139
[young Ray] Whoa, we're high.

01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:21.558
Oh, that's awesome. Look at that.

01:15:21.642 --> 01:15:22.476
[Pop] You like this?

01:15:22.559 --> 01:15:23.810
[Kerri] He totally loved Ray.

01:15:24.478 --> 01:15:26.355
You know, and he loved my father.

01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:29.149
-[Pop] Say hello to Pop. Look at me.
-[Ray] Hello.

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:31.527
[Pop] Say, "Hello, Poparoo."

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:38.116
Ray was devastated.

01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:41.537
[Ray] I'm going off on a bender.

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:44.122
[Kerri] He was in, like,
the height of addiction.

01:15:44.831 --> 01:15:46.833
Yeah, I mean, it-- I was fearful.

01:15:49.086 --> 01:15:51.630
Taking Xanax like they were M&M's.

01:15:56.843 --> 01:15:58.845
At that point, I was like,
"Fuck this company."

01:15:58.929 --> 01:16:01.473
I'm gambling every day,
doing drugs every day.

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.225
And, you know, why work?

01:16:03.308 --> 01:16:06.186
I don't have any more responsibility,
and I have all this money.

01:16:09.064 --> 01:16:11.984
I'm playing a high-stakes poker game,
and Sorbee calls me.

01:16:12.776 --> 01:16:14.111
[tense music playing]

01:16:18.365 --> 01:16:20.325
And he tells me
he got arrested for security fraud.

01:16:27.791 --> 01:16:29.793
You know,
I'm like, "I'm fucked," of course,

01:16:29.876 --> 01:16:32.337
but, you know, Iâ€¦ I try to think positive.

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:36.258
I'm pretty good at compartmentalizing
and thinking positive in any given moment.

01:16:36.341 --> 01:16:37.926
Before I left the casino that day,

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:40.846
I just took as many drugs
as possible to kind of make sure

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:44.516
if I'm getting arrested,
I'm gonna be high when I get arrested.

01:16:45.017 --> 01:16:47.102
[sirens wailing]

01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:49.771
[brakes screeching]

01:16:57.487 --> 01:16:59.406
[Kerri] His attorney called me,

01:16:59.489 --> 01:17:01.533
and she said, "You know, I have bad news."

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:04.411
"He's facing like 240 years
in federal prison."

01:17:05.370 --> 01:17:08.457
Man, this is some scary stuff, you know?

01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:10.584
I was terrified for him.

01:17:11.668 --> 01:17:13.045
I didn't wanna lose my son.

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:18.091
Centra are accused of masterminding
a fraudulent initial coin offering,

01:17:18.175 --> 01:17:22.512
that Centra offered a debit card it said
was backed by Visa and MasterCard.

01:17:22.596 --> 01:17:26.016
But the SEC says that Centra
had no relationship with either company.

01:17:26.683 --> 01:17:30.646
[Jacob] It felt good to know that justice
was gonna get served in some capacity.

01:17:30.729 --> 01:17:33.523
[interviewer] Did you feel like
you had played a part in that?

01:17:34.024 --> 01:17:37.611
Absolutely. SEC, Homeland Security,
they were using our case.

01:17:38.111 --> 01:17:42.324
I was charged with security fraud,
conspiracy to commit security fraud,

01:17:42.407 --> 01:17:45.327
wire fraud,
and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.

01:17:46.244 --> 01:17:48.997
And at that point,
I start, like, reaching out to my lawyers,

01:17:49.081 --> 01:17:51.083
and I'm like, "What's going on here?"

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:54.711
They were like, "Well, what you can do
is you can cooperate if you want."

01:17:54.795 --> 01:17:59.174
I tell my lawyer, I'm like, "I would 100%
cooperate, no problem, whatever it takes."

01:17:59.257 --> 01:18:02.552
And I met with them to try to cooperate,
and they were like,

01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:05.472
"You'reâ€¦ You can't even speak
you're on so many drugs."

01:18:05.555 --> 01:18:08.475
"Like, how you gonna cooperate?"
And they sent me to rehab.

01:18:19.486 --> 01:18:20.904
I've been to rehab 13 times.

01:18:21.571 --> 01:18:24.991
But this time, you know, I was just like,
"You know what? Fuck it. I'm done."

01:18:30.497 --> 01:18:33.709
Today is my sentencing for 11 felonies.

01:18:35.502 --> 01:18:36.920
Facing over 100 years.

01:18:39.005 --> 01:18:42.718
The biggest thing is to have the judge
believe you're not gonna do more crime.

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:46.221
The whole point of putting
someone in jail is to make it

01:18:46.304 --> 01:18:49.141
so they don't commit more crimes
and hurt the, uh, the community,

01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:50.392
or whatever the fuck they say.

01:18:50.976 --> 01:18:53.270
[lawyer] So how is the baby?

01:18:53.353 --> 01:18:55.605
[Ray] My wife is actually
in the hospital. [chuckles]

01:18:56.189 --> 01:18:59.359
-[lawyer] No way, dude.
-Yeah, her water broke this morning.

01:18:59.443 --> 01:19:01.611
-[lawyer] Oh my God.
-Yeah, I took her to the hospital.

01:19:01.695 --> 01:19:03.530
[lawyer] Do you want to go
to the hospital?

01:19:03.613 --> 01:19:05.949
-[Ray] I'm gonna go after.
-[lawyer] Is she going to make it?

01:19:06.032 --> 01:19:07.242
Yeah, I mean, her water broke.

01:19:07.325 --> 01:19:10.412
She thinks she's gonna be there all day,
but she doesn't want meâ€¦ Likeâ€¦

01:19:10.495 --> 01:19:13.415
No one wants me to delay this court date.
She doesn't want me to.

01:19:13.498 --> 01:19:15.500
[intriguing music playing]

01:19:18.962 --> 01:19:20.422
Do I look like a criminal?

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:24.968
I met my wife
while I had an ankle bracelet on.

01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:30.223
I felt like she was the one,
and Iâ€¦ I ran with it.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.560
Like, within a month, she was pregnant.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:35.854
It wasn't a planned thing.

01:19:35.937 --> 01:19:38.482
Obviously, like, you know,
you're finishing in her,

01:19:38.565 --> 01:19:41.735
so it's like, you know, you kind of know
that there's a possibility.

01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:44.696
I got sober.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.782
I cooperated with law enforcement.

01:19:46.865 --> 01:19:50.118
I cooperated with the FBI, the SEC.
I gave them everything I know.

01:19:51.745 --> 01:19:53.830
If you work with the FBI,
they work with you,

01:19:53.914 --> 01:19:58.043
andâ€¦ and you kind of, you knowâ€¦
It just requires complete honesty.

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:01.421
I gave the FBI enough information

01:20:01.505 --> 01:20:05.133
to be able to put Sorbee away
for eight years and Farkas away.

01:20:05.217 --> 01:20:07.219
[somber music playing]

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:23.318
So this is the room
where Sam got sentencedâ€¦

01:20:26.404 --> 01:20:27.489
on Zoom.

01:20:27.572 --> 01:20:29.241
Sam was sitting right there.

01:20:29.908 --> 01:20:32.577
His mother, his father, my whole family.

01:20:33.537 --> 01:20:34.704
Eight years isâ€¦

01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:37.833
It's fucked up.

01:20:39.292 --> 01:20:40.335
[exhales]

01:20:41.461 --> 01:20:43.171
[man] I think it was really drastic.

01:20:44.047 --> 01:20:47.008
I don't agree with the sentencing
across the board in this case.

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:50.303
Farkas just didn't strike me as the type.

01:20:51.388 --> 01:20:54.015
He was just sort of
a deer in the headlights.

01:20:54.099 --> 01:20:57.310
I think his biggest mistake
was getting involved

01:20:57.394 --> 01:21:00.272
andâ€¦ and relying onâ€¦
on what he was being told.

01:21:01.273 --> 01:21:02.399
But Ray Trapaniâ€¦

01:21:03.817 --> 01:21:05.527
Ray Trapani's a real criminal.

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:14.911
[Ray] The fact that I cooperated
means a lot.

01:21:14.995 --> 01:21:17.789
So, you know,
I'm in hopes that I get less time.

01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:20.834
[hopeful music playing]

01:21:21.668 --> 01:21:24.337
You know, I am sorry for what I did.

01:21:26.006 --> 01:21:28.466
It's always been very hard to find empathy

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:31.303
and these feelings towards people
that I've never really met.

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:32.929
I've always been like that.

01:21:33.763 --> 01:21:37.225
I think that's something that I need
to build on myself and really get there,

01:21:37.309 --> 01:21:41.354
where it's like I can feel for, you know,
Joe Schmo that's in China.

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:45.734
[music continues]

01:21:47.652 --> 01:21:50.405
[woman] Mister Trapani,
I'm very much influenced

01:21:50.488 --> 01:21:53.199
by the government's report
of your cooperation.

01:21:53.283 --> 01:21:55.911
I'm not sure I've ever heard
the word "extraordinary"

01:21:55.994 --> 01:22:00.624
used in connection with cooperation,
and now I've heard it multiple times

01:22:00.707 --> 01:22:02.959
at every stage of the case,

01:22:03.043 --> 01:22:07.130
from the investigation
to sentencing of your co-defendants.

01:22:07.964 --> 01:22:12.010
So, Mister Trapani,
it is the judgment of the court

01:22:12.093 --> 01:22:17.057
that you are sentenced
to a term of imprisonment of time served.

01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:19.893
I really didn't want
to interrupt the path that you are on,

01:22:19.976 --> 01:22:22.395
because you seem to be doing so well.

01:22:22.479 --> 01:22:24.272
[suspenseful music playing]

01:22:24.356 --> 01:22:26.358
[inaudible]

01:22:28.485 --> 01:22:30.654
-We did it. No jail time.
-[wife on phone]Yeah.

01:22:30.737 --> 01:22:32.489
I love you so much. I'm so happy.

01:22:32.572 --> 01:22:33.531
[Ray] I love you.

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:35.784
I'm coming now.
I'm coming straight to you then.

01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:38.995
Yeah, hold out.
An hour and a half, I'll be there.

01:22:39.079 --> 01:22:40.330
[laughs]

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:44.250
[laughing]

01:22:46.169 --> 01:22:48.296
It's shocking to me, with his record

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:51.967
and as much of a scumbag
as he admits he is,

01:22:52.592 --> 01:22:57.097
that he winds up with literally
the lowest sentence in this case.

01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:58.014
Why?

01:22:58.723 --> 01:23:01.101
Well, because he cooperated
with the government.

01:23:01.184 --> 01:23:02.644
All of a sudden,

01:23:02.727 --> 01:23:07.691
it puts an aura on somebody that somehow
justifies treating them differently.

01:23:09.901 --> 01:23:11.820
[Ray] No time, bitch. [laughs]

01:23:11.903 --> 01:23:12.988
[Kerri] Well, she loved you.

01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:15.573
[lawyer] Comparing it to Sorbee's
is like night and day.

01:23:16.074 --> 01:23:18.201
He's facing 175 years.

01:23:18.284 --> 01:23:21.287
[Petrruzzi] With cooperators, when you
completely absolve them of everything,

01:23:21.371 --> 01:23:23.999
and you reduce a sentence
from 20 years to zero,

01:23:24.082 --> 01:23:25.834
are you sending any message at all?

01:23:25.917 --> 01:23:27.127
You shouldn't commit crimes,

01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:29.796
or just the next time
that you carjack somebody,

01:23:29.879 --> 01:23:33.967
rat out the person that you did it with,
and you can go home.

01:23:34.050 --> 01:23:35.719
He's a criminal through and through.

01:23:36.219 --> 01:23:38.221
I can almost guarantee

01:23:38.304 --> 01:23:41.891
that of the three people
that were prosecuted in this case,

01:23:41.975 --> 01:23:45.770
the one most likely to wind up
in federal court again is Ray Trapani.

01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:48.314
And it's not civil court either.
It'll be criminal.

01:23:50.608 --> 01:23:52.861
[phone ringing]

01:23:53.903 --> 01:23:56.197
Yeah. Oh my God.

01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:57.407
-[lawyer] Oh.
-[Kerri] Aw.

01:23:57.490 --> 01:23:58.450
[laughing]

01:24:00.076 --> 01:24:02.162
Hey, babe. [laughs]

01:24:02.245 --> 01:24:04.706
-How's he doing, babe?
-Where are you?

01:24:04.789 --> 01:24:08.334
I'm, uh, about 20 minutes
to 30 minutes out.

01:24:08.418 --> 01:24:09.753
All right, I'll be there soon.

01:24:10.378 --> 01:24:11.296
-Okay.
-[Ray] Goodbye.

01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:12.547
[Kerri] Aw.

01:24:13.548 --> 01:24:14.466
Ouch.

01:24:14.549 --> 01:24:16.551
[joyful music playing]

01:24:21.639 --> 01:24:24.350
-[lawyer] Jeez, what a day, right?
-[Kerri chuckling]

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:26.895
A little fucking Liam.

01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:30.899
[all laugh]

01:24:32.275 --> 01:24:33.693
He wasn't even crying.

01:24:33.777 --> 01:24:35.361
[joyful music continues]

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:46.539
[Liam crying]

01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:54.547
[Robert] He's a degenerate.

01:24:55.298 --> 01:24:58.218
The audacity of the government
to praise him as a good guy.

01:25:03.473 --> 01:25:07.268
[interviewer] Ray Trapani just received
his sentencing last month.

01:25:07.352 --> 01:25:09.145
-Oh?
-[interviewer] He got no time.

01:25:09.646 --> 01:25:11.106
-Timeâ€¦ Time served.
-Really?

01:25:11.689 --> 01:25:12.524
Wow.

01:25:14.901 --> 01:25:16.653
-Wow, that's incredible.
-[interviewer] Yeah.

01:25:17.153 --> 01:25:17.987
Yeah.

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:19.906
That upsets me.

01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:21.533
That upsets me.

01:25:22.617 --> 01:25:24.953
-Can I walk now? I'm gonna--
-[interviewer] Okay, yeah.

01:25:27.205 --> 01:25:28.373
[Jacob] Oh!

01:25:33.586 --> 01:25:34.504
[door opens]

01:25:37.257 --> 01:25:38.341
Oh man.

01:25:38.424 --> 01:25:40.218
[interviewer]
Do you think he's really changed?

01:25:40.301 --> 01:25:43.555
I hope so, but that doesn't absolve him
from what he's done in his past.

01:25:43.638 --> 01:25:45.056
That, you know, umâ€¦

01:25:46.266 --> 01:25:48.143
And likely-- And likely

01:25:48.768 --> 01:25:52.105
there might be more funds out there
that he still has from other people.

01:25:52.605 --> 01:25:54.399
You know? Umâ€¦

01:25:54.941 --> 01:25:56.734
[interviewer]
What happened with your money?

01:25:59.571 --> 01:26:02.198
-We gotta stop that one.
-[interviewer] Yeah.

01:26:02.282 --> 01:26:05.160
Now, Sorbee supposedly ha--
You know, before he got arrested,

01:26:05.243 --> 01:26:07.745
they were saying
that he has a whole new fleet of cars.

01:26:08.371 --> 01:26:11.416
I told the FBI that there's
more money out there, you know.

01:26:11.499 --> 01:26:13.126
It's up to them to find it.

01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:16.087
[somber music playing]

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:26.764
-[interviewer] You're buying a house?
-[Ray] Yeah.

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:28.558
-[interviewer] How are you buying a house?
-[Ray] Money.

01:26:28.641 --> 01:26:30.560
-That's usually how it goes.
-[interviewer] Yeah.

01:26:30.643 --> 01:26:33.313
How do you have money to pay for
the house? How's he buying a house?

01:26:33.396 --> 01:26:36.065
Ray? Ask him. I don't know.

01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:38.151
[interviewer] How did Ray buy a house?

01:26:38.234 --> 01:26:39.194
Ray bought a house--

01:26:39.277 --> 01:26:43.489
Hisâ€¦ His, um, father-in-law co-signed
with his wife, yeah.

01:26:43.573 --> 01:26:46.826
I don't know any single person
sub-40 buying a house.

01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:51.289
They're all just-- They get a "good job,"
and they're just working, fucking,

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:53.333
and living in an apartment
for their whole life.

01:26:54.125 --> 01:26:56.711
[interviewer] You never know.
Like, all of a sudden there's a house.

01:26:56.794 --> 01:26:58.713
Why are you telling me that now? Because--

01:26:58.796 --> 01:27:00.798
[interviewer] I'm just--
I'm just curious, like--

01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:05.261
There's no locked, uh, millions of dollars
in crypto hidden anywhere?

01:27:05.887 --> 01:27:08.181
I wish there was
because I would cash it all out,

01:27:08.264 --> 01:27:11.142
and I would move somewhere
away from this crazy country.

01:27:12.477 --> 01:27:13.311
[laughs]

01:27:13.811 --> 01:27:14.646
Really.

01:27:14.729 --> 01:27:17.857
[Ray] Like, our parents, they were able
to buy a house for like 20 grand,

01:27:17.941 --> 01:27:20.735
keep it forever, and now they're
millionaires. It's fucking ridiculous.

01:27:20.818 --> 01:27:22.445
[Kerri] I said it from the very beginning.

01:27:22.528 --> 01:27:25.114
If you make him look like a scumbag,
I'm really gonna be pissed.

01:27:25.198 --> 01:27:27.784
Because Iâ€¦ I swear to God,
you'll be in big trouble.

01:27:29.035 --> 01:27:29.869
I'm not kidding.

01:27:29.953 --> 01:27:31.412
[interviewer] How do people trust

01:27:31.496 --> 01:27:33.665
that Ray doesn't have money
or Sorbee doesn't have money?

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:35.166
[Kerri] Sorbee definitely has money.

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:37.585
You're gonna tell me
that when all this money was made

01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:39.379
that he didn't hide it somewhere?

01:27:39.462 --> 01:27:41.422
And that he knows
when he gets out in eight years

01:27:41.506 --> 01:27:43.299
that he's gonna be perfectly fine?

01:27:43.383 --> 01:27:45.885
Why do you think
his girlfriend's staying with him?

01:27:45.969 --> 01:27:48.012
You think that there'sâ€¦
there's nothing there?

01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:49.889
She just loves him so much?

01:27:50.515 --> 01:27:54.018
I'm not saying she doesn't love him.
I don't know if she loves him or not.

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:57.397
There's no way that Sorbee
does not have money put somewhere.

01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:58.439
[laughs]

01:27:58.523 --> 01:28:00.441
[interviewer]
You say the only way to buy a house

01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:02.568
is to do something shady
or to get help from someone--

01:28:02.652 --> 01:28:04.320
-Yeah.
-[interviewer] You're buying a house.

01:28:04.404 --> 01:28:05.530
Which one did you do?

01:28:05.613 --> 01:28:07.657
I did something shady, clearly.

01:28:08.157 --> 01:28:10.368
My fucking whole story is shady shit.

01:28:11.327 --> 01:28:12.161
You know.

â™ª Everybody rolls
With their fingers crossed â™ª

01:28:30.054 --> 01:28:32.348
Once they got their 100,000 Ethereum,

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:33.975
they kept it.

01:28:34.559 --> 01:28:36.352
Was it really about the "victims,"

01:28:36.436 --> 01:28:40.315
or was it about their headlines,
their promotions, their pockets?

01:28:40.398 --> 01:28:44.110
â™ª Everybody knows the fight was fixed â™ª

01:28:44.193 --> 01:28:46.404
â™ª The poor stay poor â™ª

01:28:46.487 --> 01:28:48.323
â™ª The rich get rich â™ª

01:28:48.406 --> 01:28:51.284
â™ª That's how it goes â™ª

01:28:53.578 --> 01:28:56.414
â™ª Everybody knows â™ª

01:28:56.497 --> 01:28:58.750
[chuckling] We didn't get
our last payment.

01:28:58.833 --> 01:29:01.252
Ten months of intensive work.

01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:02.837
Yeah, no money on Centra.

01:29:03.713 --> 01:29:06.674
[Popper] The basic idea
behind cryptocurrencies

01:29:06.758 --> 01:29:11.429
was really that you shouldn't have
to trust these banks anymore.

01:29:11.512 --> 01:29:13.348
You shouldn't have to trust Wall Street.

01:29:13.431 --> 01:29:15.683
You don't need to trust
any of these institutions.

01:29:15.767 --> 01:29:21.147
The sort of grand irony is
it created a new financial system

01:29:21.230 --> 01:29:24.817
that has basically taught everybody
that they can trust nobody.

01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:28.529
â™ª And a long-stem rose â™ª

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:33.618
â™ª Everybody knows â™ª

01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:39.040
â™ª Everybody knows
That you love me, baby â™ª

01:29:39.665 --> 01:29:43.211
â™ª Everybody knows that you really do â™ª

01:29:44.253 --> 01:29:47.840
â™ª Everybody knows
That you've been faithful â™ª

01:29:47.924 --> 01:29:52.970
My entrepreneurial spirit
won't get dimmed down by my 12 felonies.

01:29:53.471 --> 01:29:57.183
â™ª Everybody knows you've been discreet â™ª

01:29:57.266 --> 01:30:01.813
â™ª But there were so many people
You just had to meet â™ª

01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:04.982
â™ª Without your clothes â™ª

01:30:06.943 --> 01:30:10.780
â™ª And everybody knows â™ª

01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:12.323
[song ends]

01:30:25.336 --> 01:30:27.338
[solemn music playing]

01:32:56.028 --> 01:32:57.613
[music ends]
