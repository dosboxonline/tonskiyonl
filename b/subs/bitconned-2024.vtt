[tense music playing]

00:15.807 --> 00:18.435
[interviewer] In the eyes of society,
you're looked at as a criminal.

00:18.518 --> 00:19.853
What are your thoughts about that?

00:19.936 --> 00:22.605
I don't mind being looked at
as a criminal, really.

00:23.606 --> 00:26.026
It's tough. I mean,
I just was doing crimes my whole life.

00:26.901 --> 00:28.153
Scamming and shit like that.

00:28.236 --> 00:30.363
-[man 1] A scammer, huh?
-[man 2] Yeah, a scammer.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.865
I just think things have changed.

00:31.948 --> 00:34.784
You know, it's not that easy
to just work hard and buy a house.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.829
Nowadays, you gotta figure out
some sorta of way to finesse the system.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.789
That's the modern-day American Dream.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.877
[interviewer]
How much did you make in total?

00:44.419 --> 00:46.546
Uh, on paper, 32 million.

00:46.629 --> 00:48.965
But, like, in reality,
we made like a few hundred million.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.761
-[interviewer] Well, that's good. [laughs]
-Yeah. Trapanis.

00:53.428 --> 00:54.971
[interviewer] Would you do it again?

00:55.055 --> 00:59.642
Uh… I always go back to this point of,
if I knew it 100% that I was gonna make

00:59.726 --> 01:02.604
$30 million doing something illegal,
would I do it? Would I not?

01:06.608 --> 01:08.902
I would lean on
that I would take the risk.

[tense music ends]

01:22.123 --> 01:23.083
[upbeat music playing]

01:23.166 --> 01:26.878
[man] I was at the New York Times
covering the cryptocurrency universe.

01:27.629 --> 01:31.883
I was the only person
at the paper who took it seriously.

01:34.511 --> 01:38.098
Most of the editors at the paper
continued to view this as a joke.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.683
It was sort of my job to say,

01:40.767 --> 01:44.521
"You know, there's something real
going on here that is worth covering."

01:44.604 --> 01:49.109
The people who cared about Bitcoin
really cared about Bitcoin.

01:49.192 --> 01:52.779
I trust the Bitcoin. I believe in
the Bitcoin. I worship the Bitcoin.

01:52.862 --> 01:56.574
[Popper] I actually started
to get captivated by this thing.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.244
This was like digital gold.

01:59.327 --> 02:02.080
[man] Your boy is officially
a Bitcoin millionaire.

02:02.163 --> 02:04.332
You guys have no idea
how much this means to me.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.043
[Popper]
It tapped into something in people.

02:07.127 --> 02:11.214
Sixty-four thousand dollars
in a couple of days doing zero work.

02:12.590 --> 02:15.426
[Popper] And then, in the middle of 2017,

02:15.510 --> 02:19.180
you had the rise
of the initial coin offering.

02:20.014 --> 02:22.308
Every day there was a new project

02:22.392 --> 02:25.645
that overnight raised
tens of millions of dollars.

02:25.728 --> 02:27.981
It became this, like, total phenomenon.

02:28.064 --> 02:33.611
Every day I see three or four
new offerings of Bitcoin number three.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.989
"This'll be better than Bitcoin.
You'll get rich overnight."

02:36.072 --> 02:37.365

02:43.705 --> 02:45.748
-We will write history.
-[audience cheers]

02:45.832 --> 02:48.293
[Popper] I mean, it was an economic frenzy

02:48.376 --> 02:52.547
that really had not been seen
before cryptocurrencies.

02:52.630 --> 02:55.508
There may not be anything there.
Companies weren't really incented

02:55.592 --> 02:58.011
to actually do anything with the money
besides spending the money.

02:58.094 --> 03:02.056
[Popper]
ICOs allowed anybody to start selling

03:02.140 --> 03:05.852
and marketing financial products
without a bank account.

03:06.436 --> 03:09.230
There was just scams
and frauds everywhere.

03:09.814 --> 03:12.066
Anybody could create an ICO,

03:12.650 --> 03:14.068
and anybody did do it. [chuckles]

03:19.282 --> 03:24.537
Centra was the archetype
of what was wrong with cryptocurrency.

03:25.622 --> 03:28.333
Crypto was just this new,
unfound territory.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.418
Completely unregulated by the SEC.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.962
And anytime you find a market like that,

03:33.046 --> 03:35.215
you just have to figure out
how to exploit that market.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.300
[pensive music playing]

03:38.092 --> 03:40.178
We didn't know anything
about this fucking business.

03:40.845 --> 03:43.681
But it didn't matter at all.
It was too easy.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.767
We lied, we cheated,

03:46.309 --> 03:48.019
and made millions of dollars.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.939
And now I'm facing over 100 years.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.027
[music fades]

03:56.110 --> 03:59.530
Ever since I was a kid,
I've always wanted to be a criminal.

03:59.614 --> 04:03.243
I was never like, "I'm gonna be a doctor,"
or, "I'm gonna be a scientist."

04:03.326 --> 04:06.996
If I could have put it in my yearbook,
I would have put, "I wanna be a criminal."

[chuckles] You know.

04:07.997 --> 04:09.749
[pensive music playing]

04:09.832 --> 04:10.833

04:15.630 --> 04:18.591
My mom was a single mom of three boys.

04:19.550 --> 04:22.262
I wish my dad was around. He just wasn't.

04:22.345 --> 04:25.265
He was a complete fucking loser,
and, you know, that's that.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.396
[man] Ray's always tried really hard.

04:31.896 --> 04:33.564
He was trying to be
someone from the street,

04:33.648 --> 04:35.358
and he's not someone from the street.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.151
He's from Atlantic Beach.

At the time,
that area was so flooded with oxy

04:46.286 --> 04:49.205
we were already
full-blown drug addicts, for sure.

04:49.914 --> 04:51.582
I loved the kid at the time.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.210
Ray was, like, one of the first
best friends I had.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.048
We started, you know, filling scrips.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.883
[pills rattling]

05:00.967 --> 05:03.636
We met some kid
who stole a prescription pad.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.556
That prescription pad got stolen from him.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.766
[Ray] We write out 120 oxys,

05:08.850 --> 05:10.643
took that prescription
and went to a Walgreens.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.061
[intriguing music continues]

05:13.479 --> 05:14.731
They filled it.

05:16.607 --> 05:19.027
It's always a cool feeling
when you hit that first mark.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.194
Fucking all amped up.

05:20.278 --> 05:23.990
You have the whole prescription pad,
knowing this is an unlimited money glitch.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.910
My freezer was just thousands of pills.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.787
[interviewer] How much were you making?

05:30.204 --> 05:33.333
We were making like 5000 a day,
you know, on a good day.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.668
[interviewer] At this age you're making
that kind of money.

05:35.752 --> 05:36.919
What're you spending money on?

05:37.003 --> 05:37.837

05:38.421 --> 05:40.131

05:43.051 --> 05:44.302

05:49.474 --> 05:50.475
And then…

05:51.225 --> 05:53.353
[sirens wailing]

05:53.436 --> 05:54.562
Ray got in trouble.

05:55.271 --> 05:58.316
He got pulled over,
and they found the bottle that said,

05:58.399 --> 06:00.651
you know, a name on it
that was probably not his name.

06:01.235 --> 06:03.529
They asked him where he got it,
and he ratted on me

06:03.613 --> 06:05.573
and… and everyone else
that filled out scrips.

06:05.656 --> 06:07.116
-[interviewer] Really?
-Yeah.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.203
-[interviewer] Did you get in trouble?
-Yeah. I mean, I did.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.456
I was going back and forth
to court for like two years.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.291
[interviewer] What did Ray get?

06:15.375 --> 06:16.501
Uh, nothing.

06:18.503 --> 06:19.587
-Why?
-[chuckles] When--

06:19.670 --> 06:22.840

you're, you know, you're good.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.802
[solemn music playing]

06:25.885 --> 06:29.889
So it surprises me that he has
a tattoo of "loyalty" on his ribs,

06:29.972 --> 06:32.558
and he's never been loyal
to not one of his friends.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.479
It's disappointing
that he turned out to be the way he is.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.984
Ray's a piece of shit, you know?

07:01.796 --> 07:05.007
I have a good brain for, you know,
making money at whatever it is.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.927
So when Bert reached out to me
with a legitimate business idea,

07:08.010 --> 07:08.845
I was game.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.013
[car engine revving]

07:11.097 --> 07:13.266
[man] I've known Ray since third grade.

07:14.225 --> 07:17.603
He's always been fascinated with money.
He's obsessed with it.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.689
That's his one true love.

07:20.189 --> 07:21.023
That's Ray.

07:23.317 --> 07:26.112
[Ray] Bert was always in the car business,
so he knew the market.

07:26.195 --> 07:29.949
And we came up with Miami Exotics,
which is a car rental business.

07:30.032 --> 07:31.325
Luxury cars.

07:32.743 --> 07:34.287
Rolls Royce, Lamborghinis.

[synthwave music ends]

07:35.872 --> 07:38.291
[car engine revving]

07:38.791 --> 07:42.086
This was my transition
into having a legitimate company.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.882
I've done a lot of fraudulent scams
and all this type of shit,

07:45.965 --> 07:48.050
but I don't really know business yet.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.307
But Bert knew the perfect guy,
and, you know, I knew him also.

07:54.390 --> 07:55.892
So we brought in Sorbee.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.020
-[car engine revving]
-[upbeat music playing]

07:59.103 --> 08:01.731
[upbeat music playing]

08:01.814 --> 08:05.109
And Sorbee was a kid from high school
that I fucking hated. [chuckles]

08:09.071 --> 08:10.865
He was always the smart kid,

08:10.948 --> 08:13.743
but he was never a kid
that I trusted or liked.

08:14.327 --> 08:18.289
[Bert] Ray and Sorbee were never friends.
They always disliked each other.

08:20.791 --> 08:23.961
He just had this weaselly way
where he thought he was super cool.

08:24.045 --> 08:27.131
Like, kind of wanted to be ghetto
but sounded super nerdy.

08:27.215 --> 08:30.635
He was known for being
a scammer or, like, ripping people off.

08:30.718 --> 08:33.763
I don't know, he just wasn't
my type of people. He does add value.

08:33.846 --> 08:37.016
Me and Bert are very good at, like,
relationships and being able to just be,

08:37.099 --> 08:39.810
like, the charismatic people
that can make the money.

08:40.353 --> 08:43.814
And so, like, having Sorbee there
is very beneficial.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.400
You can just keep him
in a room working all day.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.945
It's not like everybody's
just good at the same shit.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.488
[upbeat music ends]

08:50.571 --> 08:53.241
[interviewer] How much money
did you need to raise to start this?

08:53.324 --> 08:55.493
Uh, roughly half a million dollars.

08:56.619 --> 08:59.497
You know, Ray called me and he said,
you know, "We just need financing."

08:59.580 --> 09:00.706
[happy music playing]

09:00.790 --> 09:03.334
So he went to my parents.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.462
He's been saying he's gonna
be rich since he could talk.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.632
Probably comes from my father.

09:10.424 --> 09:14.637
My dad was a very good man,
and he always took care of my family.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.600
[Ray] Growing up, my grandfather
was my only father figure that I had.

09:19.684 --> 09:20.685
We all called him Pop.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.896
My grandfather was,
all in all, a great guy.

Doing criminal shit
doesn't mean you're a bad person.

09:27.650 --> 09:28.985
I always looked at my grandfather

09:29.068 --> 09:31.320
like he was
the biggest mob boss there ever was.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.323
He was able to support
my family financially.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.868
I was like,
"You know, I'm gonna be a criminal

09:37.952 --> 09:40.037
and support my family financially also."

09:40.121 --> 09:44.250
I don't know if he saw, like, you know,
suitcases of cash like I did.

-[interviewer] You saw suitcases of cash?
-Yeah.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.880
What are you trying to say?
He's in the mafia?

09:49.964 --> 09:53.342
No, I'm more in the mafia
than he was. [laughs]

to do with the elevator business.

We went down to Florida

Met his partners.

He saw me happy,
which was, like, the big thing for him.

They just believed in me and were like,

10:15.906 --> 10:19.201
"Here's an opportunity. Make it whatever
you think you're gonna make it."

10:19.285 --> 10:22.913
Bill would do anything for Ray,
and so he was the father figure.

10:23.539 --> 10:26.459
My grandfather signed, you know,
a quarter million-dollar loan

10:26.542 --> 10:28.669
against his house,
a home equity line of credit,

10:28.753 --> 10:31.130
to give me some sort of opportunity
of having this business.

We took that opportunity
and tried to go fully legit.

everything was pretty…
pretty fun and enjoyable.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.270
[car alarm beeps]

11:28.354 --> 11:29.480
[car engine revving]

11:30.272 --> 11:33.067
The issue was
that the spending was out of hand.

11:33.150 --> 11:35.152
[brooding music playing]

11:37.697 --> 11:42.034
If the company is generating a profit
of 60,000, between the three of us,

11:42.118 --> 11:44.620
somehow we were spending
more than that every month.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.750
I ended up getting more loans
for roughly a half a million dollars.

11:49.834 --> 11:54.171
Just about everybody in my family,
my aunts, my mom, her husband, my grandma,

11:54.255 --> 11:57.842
co-signed some sort of car loan
or credit card loan.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.677
I saw Sorbee on Instagram.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.555
He posted a big vacation
that he had in the Bahamas.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.849
And that's when I was like,
"What is this kid doing?"

12:05.349 --> 12:07.810
Obviously, you know,
something was not right.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.562
[brooding music continues]

12:18.237 --> 12:20.197
Vacations, hotels.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.868
Whether it be, like,
Sorbee going out to the club,

12:23.951 --> 12:26.620
or me just gambling,
or whatever it may be.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.289
Bert buying a fucking dog.

12:28.372 --> 12:29.832
[panting]

12:29.915 --> 12:33.711
Bert went and he bought, like,
a $2,000 dog on the company card.

12:33.794 --> 12:36.380
[Ray] Money was leaking out
left and right in these weird areas.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.924
And then, like,
sometimes just checks would be cashed.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.677
Sorbee robbed the company.
That's what happened.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.138
But the checks were written
in Bert's name. So, you know.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.599
Sorbee was forging my name

12:47.183 --> 12:50.060
and signing it to himself
and cashing them.

12:50.644 --> 12:53.522
I don't fucking know who was writing
those checks. I still don't know.

12:54.023 --> 12:56.942
Bert and Sorbee had no skin in the game
as far as finances.

12:57.026 --> 13:00.738
I'll give anything to my family,
but not to you… you little pricks.

13:00.821 --> 13:01.655
Really.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.534
And there was always the excuse of,
"Oh, you're spending crazy money also."

13:05.618 --> 13:09.747
But, you know, the thing is, those debts
were all my debts to… to deal with,

13:09.830 --> 13:10.915
my family's loans.

13:10.998 --> 13:14.001
So that's where, like,
I just started to go fucking crazy.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.004
[Kerri] They 100% took advantage of him.

13:17.087 --> 13:19.882
[interviewer] Do you think he took
advantage of you guys? That Ray did?

13:19.965 --> 13:22.384
Do I think that Ray took advantage?
Yes, I do.

13:22.468 --> 13:25.721
[somber music playing]

13:25.805 --> 13:29.183
He really thought that it would develop
into this great business.

13:29.266 --> 13:32.186
[Ray] I was in embarrassment
of how much in debt I was

13:32.269 --> 13:34.939
that I was telling him
Miami Exotics is doing great.

13:35.439 --> 13:36.816
But the money is just gone.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.943
He was the one
that always extended his arm for me,

13:39.026 --> 13:41.737
and I… I just didn't want
to disappoint my grandfather.

13:42.613 --> 13:46.242
We had about 100,000 left. I was, like,
"Fuck it, I'll take it to the casino."

13:46.992 --> 13:50.329
"I'm gonna take all this money
and just take one last chance."

13:52.498 --> 13:54.583
I played baccarat all night.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.337
I ended up losing everything I had.

14:00.047 --> 14:02.216
Fuck it. You know, I'm gonna kill myself.

14:05.761 --> 14:08.305
I just knew he'd be so disappointed.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.515
[Pop] Raymond?

14:09.598 --> 14:11.934
[Ray] When you're depressed,
you lose sight of everything.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.853
It's a rabbit hole of shit.

14:15.229 --> 14:18.983
I remember just opening that bottle
and just chugging 'em.

14:19.066 --> 14:20.109
I took about 50,

14:20.192 --> 14:22.278
which just about anybody would die from.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.613
It's 100 milligrams of Xanax.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.908
[Kerri] He called me after he woke up.

14:28.868 --> 14:32.037
I mean, it's… it's heartbreaking,
you know, to see… see your kid like that.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.205
You know, it's…

14:34.248 --> 14:35.457
You know, it's, um…

14:40.838 --> 14:44.425
You know, I feel sorry for him
because I felt like, you know, like…

14:44.508 --> 14:45.676
You know, he's…

14:45.759 --> 14:47.261
Even though he could be a little shit,

14:47.344 --> 14:49.597
you know,
he always had a vulnerability about him,

14:49.680 --> 14:52.850
even when--
No matter what he was doing, you know.

14:55.144 --> 14:58.564
No, we just-- You know, we cried.
We both cried and, you know,

14:59.231 --> 15:00.858
I just basically said,

15:01.692 --> 15:03.736
"You can figure it out.
We'll get this figured out."

15:05.070 --> 15:07.156
Like, "You know, you're really smart."

15:07.239 --> 15:10.659
[somber music playing]

15:10.743 --> 15:13.954
[Ray] I'm sitting
in Miami Exotics' office.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.081
[Bert] Ray was super upset.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.041
And then…

15:18.667 --> 15:21.712
Sorbee came up and started talking to Ray.

15:22.963 --> 15:26.091
[Ray] Yeah, so at that point,
I just hated Sorbee completely

15:26.175 --> 15:28.093
'cause I just felt, like, so betrayed.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.640
And then he starts
talking about cryptocurrency.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.768
I'm like, "What the fuck
is this kid even talking about?"

15:35.851 --> 15:37.686
[chuckling] "What the fuck is that?"

15:38.395 --> 15:42.650
You can just see, like, the light
in his eyes, that this was something.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.401
And they came to the conclusion

15:44.485 --> 15:46.862
that it was best
to kick me out of the company,

15:47.863 --> 15:51.659
and that he would make
more money with Sorbee than with me.

15:51.742 --> 15:54.078
That's what parlayed right into Centra.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.163
[suspenseful music playing]

16:01.085 --> 16:03.212
Sorbee's actually like the idea guy.

16:03.295 --> 16:06.298
You know, he's… he's super good
at just coming up with ideas.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.593
Or just sitting behind a computer

16:09.677 --> 16:13.055
and… and, you know,
knowing where to steal ideas from.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.642
One of the clear problems
with cryptocurrencies at that time

16:16.725 --> 16:18.394
was that it was hard to use them.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.939
People have gotten rich with Bitcoin,

16:22.022 --> 16:25.734
and you could not spend
your cryptocurrency.

16:26.902 --> 16:29.071
[Sorbee] Cryptocurrency started getting
really popular.

16:29.154 --> 16:32.408
And I jumped on just like everyone else
about three years ago

16:32.491 --> 16:35.244
and was trading Bitcoin
and, uh, Ethereum, etc.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.413
And then, one day,
I was just sitting home,

16:37.496 --> 16:38.789
and I was like, "You know what?"

16:38.872 --> 16:42.584
"What if I could just go spend my Bitcoins
and the profits I've made

16:42.668 --> 16:44.044
and just go buy stuff with it

16:44.128 --> 16:46.964
without having to worry
about withdrawing, depositing, et cetera?"

16:47.047 --> 16:50.759
And that's where kind of the idea
manifested for Centra Card.

16:54.221 --> 16:57.099
Our pitch to the world was
we were gonna create a debit card

16:57.182 --> 16:59.727
where you'd be able to spend
cryptocurrency in real-time,

16:59.810 --> 17:00.853
anytime, anywhere.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.771
[suspenseful music continues]

17:02.855 --> 17:05.816
We're gonna create a…
a marketplace for cryptocurrency.

17:05.899 --> 17:08.277
We're gonna have
our own exchange, our own wallet.

17:08.360 --> 17:09.903
-[beeps]
-[whirs]

17:09.987 --> 17:12.281
Basically, everything you need
in cryptocurrency,

17:12.364 --> 17:14.366
we were gonna put it in one central place.

17:15.617 --> 17:16.535
[beeps]

17:18.871 --> 17:20.122
[Popper] During the ICO boom,

17:20.205 --> 17:24.126
you had people doing
these serious projects.

17:24.209 --> 17:28.213
Kids, you know,
with PhDs from Stanford, from MIT,

17:28.297 --> 17:31.175
at the same time as you had these kids

17:31.258 --> 17:35.054
who were agents
at rental car companies in Miami,

17:35.137 --> 17:40.184
who were raising the exact same
amount of money as the PhDs from MIT,

17:40.267 --> 17:46.356
without any experience in this universe
that they were building in.

17:47.357 --> 17:49.193
And it was just too easy to do.

17:49.276 --> 17:52.988
[tense music playing]

17:53.072 --> 17:55.741
We created the basis of the whole company.

17:57.618 --> 18:01.538
First thing, we have to create a LinkedIn
and put our universities. [chuckles]

18:02.498 --> 18:03.916
[tense music continues]

18:03.999 --> 18:06.293
[keyboard clacking]

18:12.007 --> 18:13.300
We all went to Harvard.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.680
[laughs] We were trying to make ourselves
look as smart as possible.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.895
Creating the business plan
that you present to the world

18:24.978 --> 18:26.230
was the next thing.

18:26.313 --> 18:28.816
There's a company called TenX in Singapore

18:29.358 --> 18:31.026
that created a debit card,

18:31.110 --> 18:33.445
and they just raised roughly $20 million.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.740
We're like, "Let's just take that idea
and make it our own."

18:36.824 --> 18:39.076
We hired a guy on Upwork,

18:39.576 --> 18:41.620
and he just took their website

18:41.703 --> 18:45.374
and changed the word TenX
to Centra just about on every page.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.546
[tense music continues]

19:06.478 --> 19:07.688
[man] I'm a developer

19:07.771 --> 19:11.441
and worked as a freelancer
to develop Centra Tech.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.777
[gentle piano music playing]

19:16.321 --> 19:20.868
I was hired to work
as a developer for Centra project.

19:20.951 --> 19:24.621
I was like five
when I start working with computers.

19:26.456 --> 19:28.667
Some people might think I'm a genius.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.961
[both laughing]

19:31.044 --> 19:34.715
I think every problem can be solved
if you put enough effort.

19:34.798 --> 19:38.343
There is literally nothing
that can't be solved.

19:39.511 --> 19:43.599
Well, we were freelancing at that time.
Working on different projects.

19:46.059 --> 19:52.191
And one day we got a request for a number,
and we meet this guy on the phone.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.483
His name was Sam.

19:54.693 --> 19:55.694
[Sorbee] It's very simple.

19:55.777 --> 20:02.117
It's a lightning speed, real-time, uh,
crypto asset to fiat conversion system

20:02.201 --> 20:06.580
that's designed to work with an endless
amount of assets of our choice.

20:06.663 --> 20:09.041
Currently, we support eight.
We're gonna go to 12.

20:09.124 --> 20:11.084
[Martin]
And we were pretty excited for the project

20:11.168 --> 20:14.213
because that kind of technology
was not present on the market,

20:14.296 --> 20:17.090
so it was very good idea to be developed.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.760
Centrachain is going
to be our own blockchain.

20:20.677 --> 20:23.597
[interviewer] Are you guys
personally interested in crypto?

20:24.389 --> 20:26.183
-Um…
-Well, it's a trend.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.478
[keyboard clacking]

20:31.063 --> 20:34.608
Usually the people with ideas
have very little knowledge in technology

20:34.691 --> 20:36.318
or how the things are done.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.737
So we put it together.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.822
[crickets chirping]

20:42.658 --> 20:46.078
People need to understand that our product
is going to be the best, hands down.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.372
-[music ends]
-[dog panting]

20:51.667 --> 20:52.793
[slurping]

20:55.921 --> 20:57.005
[pensive music playing]

20:57.089 --> 21:02.886
[man] I was invested in Ethereum, Bitcoin,
and I made good choices.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.638
Pretty smart investments.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.182
[interviewer]
What excited you initially about it?

21:07.266 --> 21:09.810
Was this just like an investment thing,
or was it more than that?

21:10.894 --> 21:12.896
[man] Um, can I be, like, really honest?

21:13.563 --> 21:15.691
I wanted to be wealthy, right? Yeah.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.613
I wanted to make money quickly,

21:22.322 --> 21:23.323
travel the world…

21:25.617 --> 21:27.035
be financially free.

21:30.706 --> 21:34.126
The issue at that time is,
how do you spend cryptocurrency?

21:34.793 --> 21:36.712
And I came across Centra Tech.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.631
It was exciting at the time.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.759
I was all about Centra Tech. I was like,
"Look at this, this makes sense."

21:44.344 --> 21:48.682
I was young, and as a military member,
I did not get paid that much money.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.602
I got hooked
because of the opportunity to make money.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.689
[exciting piano music playing]

21:55.772 --> 21:58.150
But then also having a utility device

21:58.233 --> 22:02.029
that would allow me to spend
my newly-acquired financial freedom.

22:07.909 --> 22:10.329
All of the technology sounded good.

22:13.081 --> 22:15.667
They had a real team
that could build that tech.

22:19.379 --> 22:22.299
They had backing from Visa and Bancorp.

22:24.509 --> 22:26.928
And there was the CEO.

22:33.060 --> 22:36.688
Michael Edwards was the one
that stuck out, big-time, for everyone.

22:39.566 --> 22:43.445
There's no technology company
or credit card company that's two people.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.155
[inspirational music playing]

22:45.238 --> 22:48.241
Michael Edwards was
a seed investor in Centra Tech.

22:48.325 --> 22:49.785
You know, he believed in our concept.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.663
You know,
he had business experience in this field.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.291
He didn't really want to be
a part of operations.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.252
He just believed in the concept
and wanted us to get going.

23:01.004 --> 23:04.633
We made him the CEO
because we didn't want anybody to see

23:04.716 --> 23:07.135
that young kids
were the owners of this company.

23:07.219 --> 23:10.680
We wanted somebody that would represent
a strong older figure.

23:12.099 --> 23:15.936
To have somebody that's, like, respectable
and presentable to the public.

23:18.897 --> 23:19.981
We had everything.

23:21.274 --> 23:23.777
How would you not be interested
in this company?

23:25.278 --> 23:28.365
Once we created the website
and launched the Slack channel,

23:28.448 --> 23:31.785
there was just an influx
of people interested so fast.

23:32.869 --> 23:35.705
[Jacob]
Slack was the direct communication portal

23:35.789 --> 23:38.250
from the founders to investors.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.588
I was interested in the metrics
that they were pushing.

23:43.672 --> 23:46.508
They're like, "You're gonna be
one of the first investors in,

23:46.591 --> 23:50.595
and that means you have the maximum amount
of benefit you can generate from this."

23:50.679 --> 23:52.848
And that's the way
that I looked at it at the time.

23:53.348 --> 23:57.060
You guys who can get into the ICO,
may be very worthwhile to do.

23:57.144 --> 24:00.021
I'm excited for Centra.
I'm gonna be buying.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.190
[man 1] And they have
a really great team behind them.

24:02.274 --> 24:05.402
[man 2] Real professional.
Seems like they have their stuff together.

24:06.194 --> 24:07.696

24:10.031 --> 24:12.033
[beeping]

24:14.077 --> 24:15.829
[interviewer]
What'd he tell you he was doing?

24:15.912 --> 24:17.330
What did you ask about his business?

24:17.414 --> 24:21.418
You know, he would just basically
would tell me, "It's an electronic money."

24:21.501 --> 24:25.380
"And it's the currency of,
you know, the next generation."

24:25.464 --> 24:27.424
Something about Bitcoins or something?

24:28.800 --> 24:30.343
I don't even know what it is.

24:30.427 --> 24:31.428
[pensive music playing]

24:31.511 --> 24:32.846
[laughs]

24:32.929 --> 24:35.599
[beeping]

24:35.682 --> 24:37.976
You can see here
they have their token sale

24:38.059 --> 24:41.897
starting tonight at midnight.
All right, so that's coming up soon.

24:42.397 --> 24:45.317
Uh, that's why I want to get
this video out to you stat.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.903
[pensive music continues]

24:51.615 --> 24:54.034
[clock ticking]

24:54.117 --> 24:57.078
[Ray] Our ICO had been live
for a few weeks.

24:58.038 --> 25:01.583
It's not really, like,
this big success at all at first.

25:05.545 --> 25:06.463
It sucked.

25:08.465 --> 25:12.636
About a month goes by, we made ten,
twenty, fifty thousand.

25:13.345 --> 25:16.556
We're rolling. We're rolling.
Sixty, seventy, eighty thousand.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.683
[ticking rapidly]

25:19.476 --> 25:20.560
And then one night,

25:22.062 --> 25:24.272
tons of money just starts flooding in.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.107
A hundred thousand,
another hundred thousand,

25:26.191 --> 25:27.526
five hundred thousand.

25:29.194 --> 25:31.154
Within another hour, we had $2 million.

25:31.238 --> 25:34.533
We're like, "What the fuck,
is this even real? What is going on here?"

25:37.118 --> 25:39.538
[Jacob] It was pretty exciting
to watch it go up.

25:40.163 --> 25:41.831
Just watching something go up

25:41.915 --> 25:45.377
and become extremely valuable, it's like
a drug, like adrenaline hitting you.

25:45.460 --> 25:48.797
You're so excited that your investment
is making a ton of money.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.967
It brings up all these
different opportunities in your mind.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.426
"What can I do with my life now?"

25:54.553 --> 25:57.472
[Ray] Clearly there was a reason
why all this big money was coming in.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.978
People in our chat room started saying,

26:03.061 --> 26:05.021
"Clif High wrote this article.
You guys see that?"

26:05.105 --> 26:07.107
Me and Sorbee, like, jumped in there.
We're like,

26:07.190 --> 26:10.318
"Of course we know Clif High.
We love Clif High. Yeah, he's the man."

26:10.402 --> 26:11.861
We had no fucking idea who he was.

26:11.945 --> 26:15.156
The whole, uh, banking system is failing.

26:15.240 --> 26:18.326
But in the… in the meantime,
we're all going to be dealing with

26:18.410 --> 26:21.496
real money in the form
of gold, silver, and cryptos.

26:21.580 --> 26:25.083
And the cryptos are going
to be, um, the fluid part of it.

26:25.166 --> 26:27.836
And he was, like,
a crypto guru type of guy.

26:27.919 --> 26:29.879
He's just some, like, some old nerd.

26:31.715 --> 26:34.092
He was saying
this is gonna be a big thing.

26:34.175 --> 26:37.012
He put out this press release
telling all his big investors

26:37.095 --> 26:39.097
to put out their money for Centra.

26:43.059 --> 26:45.770
We went from having, like, 200 people
in our Slack channel

26:45.854 --> 26:49.149
to having like 2,000 people
within, like, you know, a couple hours.

26:49.816 --> 26:52.694
Time to go to the stratosphere.
This company's takin' off.

26:53.486 --> 26:55.155
[printer whirring]

26:56.072 --> 26:58.074
[upbeat music playing]

27:02.912 --> 27:04.581
With ICOs,
it's like you're printing money.

27:04.664 --> 27:06.499
That's what you're doing.
You're printing money.

27:06.583 --> 27:07.876
You're allowed to print money.

27:07.959 --> 27:12.088
That moment was probably the best moment
of Centra, like, as far as feelings.

27:13.173 --> 27:16.301
It's the craziest shit to think
we were able to raise that much money

27:16.384 --> 27:18.595
with having absolutely nothing
but a website.

27:20.847 --> 27:23.099
I figured
it wasn't, like, aboveboard, right?

27:23.183 --> 27:25.852
Like, I just, I kind of
put two and two together on that.

27:25.935 --> 27:28.897
But I also, like-- You got to realize
it was very par for the course.

27:28.980 --> 27:32.609
I knew Ray was gonna be a millionaire.
Like, he's been saying it forever.

27:32.692 --> 27:35.570
Like, if he didn't,
I'd be shocked, to be honest.

27:38.281 --> 27:42.410
Even as a kid, he was just always
interested in making money.

27:42.494 --> 27:46.539
And committing crimes seemed to be,
like, his main motivating force.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.751
He has such a fucked-up moral compass.

27:49.834 --> 27:53.755
He's always, like, figuring out these
weird systems and how to manipulate them.

27:53.838 --> 27:56.966
Whether that be exploiting people
or scamming, that's who he is.

27:58.593 --> 27:59.552
They have nothing.

27:59.636 --> 28:01.846
The investors think
they have all this shit built.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.808
So, the whole thing
is to now make themselves

28:04.891 --> 28:07.560
as legitimate as possible
to secure this investment.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.021
It is a good idea, right?

28:10.563 --> 28:11.564
[footsteps approaching]

["Are You My Woman (Tell Me So)"
by The Chi-Lites playing]

28:14.567 --> 28:15.402
[inhales]

28:16.820 --> 28:20.573
My name is Raymond Trapani,
Chief Operating Officer of Centra Tech.

28:23.201 --> 28:25.662
After the Clif High interview,
we had a few million dollars,

28:25.745 --> 28:27.414
and we're like,
"We have to get an office."

28:27.497 --> 28:30.125
The pressure was on. We needed
something to present to the world.

28:30.208 --> 28:33.086
Up until that point,
we were working in a small bedroom.

28:33.169 --> 28:36.005
We get a beautiful office.
And it was perfect.

28:36.089 --> 28:39.884
Let's give you guys a quick tour.
Hopefully, I'm still live right now.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.345
-[phone ringing]
-[Ray] Glass windows, really sleek.

28:44.973 --> 28:47.851
It just looked like a tech-based company
would live there, right?

28:48.476 --> 28:50.437
We hired roughly 50 people.

28:51.146 --> 28:55.108
[Sorbee] So this is our offices.
This is our customer support area.

28:55.191 --> 28:56.609
-Say hi, girls.
-Hi.

28:57.694 --> 29:00.739
[Ray] You have, you know, hot girls
who can do, like, assistant work.

29:00.822 --> 29:05.326
Then you can have customer service,
which also could be half hot girls. Uh…

29:05.410 --> 29:08.329
-[Sorbee] That's our COO, Raymond Trapani.
-How's everybody doing?

29:08.413 --> 29:10.623
You're hiring real developers
to build real tech.

29:10.707 --> 29:12.876
[Sorbee] This is what we call
the brain room right here.

29:12.959 --> 29:15.670
As many people know,
we work with many talented individuals.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.548
[Ray] You know, I don't think any of us
really knew what the process was.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.425
We were just
shooting at the hip from day one.

29:21.551 --> 29:24.929
The employees definitely thought
the company was fully legit.

29:25.013 --> 29:28.933
All right, we got the man, the myth,
the legend, Mr. Farkas right here. Say hi.

29:29.017 --> 29:29.976
[music stops]

29:30.059 --> 29:32.228
What's up, everybody?
This is Robert Farkas.

29:32.312 --> 29:34.481
I just wanted to give
our community an update

29:34.564 --> 29:37.192
about what we've been working
so diligently towards.

29:38.276 --> 29:40.987
When Sam originally told me
about Centra Tech,

29:41.863 --> 29:45.241
he said, "I have this new technology.
It's gonna be the future of finance."

29:45.325 --> 29:49.037
And it was probably the most exciting
thing I've ever experienced in my life.

29:49.537 --> 29:51.080
Everyone wanted to be part of it.

29:51.164 --> 29:54.709
Even if you didn't know much about crypto,
you were like, "Wow, that's really cool."

29:54.793 --> 29:58.588
"You created a debit card that connects
magic internet money to the real world?"

29:58.671 --> 30:01.299
[mellow music playing]

30:01.382 --> 30:03.343
You know, he needed help.
He needed employees.

30:03.426 --> 30:04.969
He was doing too much on his own.

30:05.053 --> 30:09.015
He was juggling a million things,
and that's when mistakes happen.

30:10.350 --> 30:12.060
I said, "I'm not a software engineer,

30:12.143 --> 30:15.313
but I can add value to the company
some way, shape, or form."

30:15.396 --> 30:18.483
Robert Farkas was
Sorbee's girlfriend's brother.

30:18.566 --> 30:21.027
We told him to quit his job
and come work for us.

30:21.110 --> 30:22.821
[interviewer]
Was he qualified to be a CFO?

30:22.904 --> 30:25.031
Definitely not qualified to be a CFO.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.200
[audience cheering]

30:27.283 --> 30:29.619
He was a stripper in his past life.

30:30.578 --> 30:31.788
[laughs]

30:33.039 --> 30:34.749
You know, once we raised enough money

30:34.833 --> 30:36.835
and we had a lot of people
in the chat rooms,

30:36.918 --> 30:39.420
we needed someone
that would just sit on there all day

30:39.504 --> 30:41.714
and just talk
to these fucking thousands of people.

30:42.215 --> 30:44.551
[Robert]
So many chats funneled into our company.

30:44.634 --> 30:46.803
We had to juggle
all these different forums.

30:46.886 --> 30:48.096
I was doing conferences,

30:48.179 --> 30:50.932
setting up booths,
getting the community involved.

30:51.432 --> 30:53.351
It felt like we were changing the world.

30:56.187 --> 30:59.440
Sam had been coding
since he was 13 years old.

30:59.524 --> 31:01.818
He was a go-getter,
a hustler, a smart kid.

31:01.901 --> 31:02.944
I think he's a genius.

31:04.779 --> 31:06.948
Sam got things set up in light speed.

31:07.031 --> 31:08.867
A speed that has never been seen before.

31:08.950 --> 31:12.662
So this is a lot of project work
that we're doing with a lot of engineers.

31:13.413 --> 31:14.873
Let's start this journey!

31:14.956 --> 31:17.333
[cheerful music playing]

31:17.417 --> 31:22.297
We have a 50,000 card order
that's being prepared for manufacturing.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.799
So mass production
is right around the corner, guys.

31:25.383 --> 31:29.053
December is our… our timeline
on getting these cards to you guys.

31:29.137 --> 31:30.096
[phones ringing]

31:30.179 --> 31:33.933
We promised people they would be getting
the cards out before Christmas.

31:34.017 --> 31:38.563
We figured if we could just provide that,
none of the other stuff matters.

31:40.064 --> 31:42.692
We're solving problems
on the project pretty fast.

31:43.776 --> 31:45.570
The development was speeding up.

31:46.362 --> 31:50.366
[Jonny] This shady company just graduated
to, like, the next level, right?

31:51.159 --> 31:52.327
For Sorbee,

31:52.410 --> 31:56.831
the whole thing is to now make themselves
as legitimate as possible, right?

31:56.915 --> 31:59.500
I'm a researcher
as well as my teams are researchers.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.378
[Jonny] Sorbee did a lot of research.
He fucking did it.

32:02.879 --> 32:05.673
He wants to figure it out,
like, actually do it.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.092
[cheerful music continues]

32:09.218 --> 32:11.638
[Robert] We literally stayed up
all night every night.

32:14.140 --> 32:17.060
We were just running
on adrenaline and Monsters.

32:17.143 --> 32:19.520
Yeah, we were working more than full time.

32:20.605 --> 32:23.566
I don't remember Ray
contributing much of anything.

32:25.193 --> 32:26.361
[ice clinking]

32:27.070 --> 32:29.489
He had like this little mafioso vibe.

32:29.572 --> 32:31.658
Loved gambling and loved money.

32:34.869 --> 32:36.579
And the whole time he was, um,

32:38.414 --> 32:39.248
medicated.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.088
[music fades]

32:45.171 --> 32:47.799
[Ray] My first thing,
I went and bought all beautiful suits.

32:47.882 --> 32:48.967
I bought Armani suits.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.594
I get them all tailored perfect.

32:52.178 --> 32:54.847
-How many suits did you get?
-I was in the mall every day.

32:54.931 --> 32:56.849
-Going to Saks every single day.
-Really?

32:56.933 --> 32:58.309
My suit guy just like--

32:58.393 --> 33:00.812
-[interviewer] He must have loved you.
-Yeah.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.815
We were making
about a half million dollars a day.

33:03.898 --> 33:05.483
Money just was flying in.

33:05.566 --> 33:07.944
I went from, like, having
a few hundred thousand in the bank,

33:08.027 --> 33:10.613
to just having millions
in your own personal bank account.

33:12.281 --> 33:14.283
-At 24 in Miami.
-[interviewer] Yeah.

33:15.910 --> 33:16.786
[Ray] Got a new car.

33:16.869 --> 33:18.913
-[car engine starts, revs]
-[tires screeching]

33:18.997 --> 33:22.166
We were trying to put as much money
to the side as we possibly could.

33:22.667 --> 33:26.004
You can always just cash out more.
Essentially print more money.

33:26.087 --> 33:28.673
[interviewer] It was coming in so easy
that it really didn't matter.

33:29.215 --> 33:31.801
[Ray] I remember one time during the ICO,

33:31.884 --> 33:34.554
there was this one guy
who was trying to invest,

33:34.637 --> 33:37.890
and then he gave me his password
to his whole crypto account.

33:37.974 --> 33:40.977
He meant to send me his passcode
to send the Centracoins to,

33:41.060 --> 33:42.353
and he gave me his password.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.272
And I was in this moment. I was like,

33:44.355 --> 33:46.482
"Holy shit, this guy
just gave me his password."

33:46.566 --> 33:49.110
I logged in. Couldn't help myself.
I already had made millions.

33:49.193 --> 33:51.821
This is like 100,000
sitting in his account.

33:51.904 --> 33:55.283
And what do I do here?
I just transferred it all to my account.

33:56.701 --> 34:01.330
This guy trusted me, and I felt like
I genuinely robbed this guy, you know?

34:02.874 --> 34:04.584
That was a fucked-up moment for sure.

34:05.084 --> 34:06.961
[Robert]
Ray always had a lot of cash on him.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.630
Like, he literally had it in his hoodie,
and he's dropping it,

34:09.714 --> 34:10.631
and he's, like, wasted.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.925
And everyone's like,
"What's up with this guy?"

34:13.009 --> 34:14.260
Ray was in his own world.

34:14.343 --> 34:15.678
[club music playing faintly]

34:15.762 --> 34:17.555
He just wanted to stuff his pockets.

34:17.638 --> 34:19.640
[pensive music playing]

34:26.856 --> 34:28.691
[music fades]

34:28.775 --> 34:30.777
[Ray]
It wasn't like you had to do much work

34:30.860 --> 34:32.653
to get these people to be interested.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.323
You know it's gonna be easy
to pump this company up.

34:36.282 --> 34:39.452
You know, it's really all marketing.

34:39.535 --> 34:42.080
[Sorbee] Sounds good, brother.
Thank you. All right, bye.

34:44.624 --> 34:47.168
Just spoke to fucking,
motherfucking Floyd Mayweather!

34:47.251 --> 34:48.628
[Ray laughs] Yes!

34:48.711 --> 34:49.962
[tense music playing]

34:50.046 --> 34:52.423
[reporter] Next up, we have
some pretty crazy news coming out

34:52.507 --> 34:53.966
from the Floyd Mayweather camp.

34:54.050 --> 34:56.135
[contemplative music playing]

34:56.969 --> 34:58.471
[Ray] How can we promote this company,

34:58.554 --> 35:01.432
now that we have this amount of money,
to get it to the next level?

35:02.016 --> 35:04.435
Let's get an endorsement
from a major celebrity.

35:04.519 --> 35:07.688
[Robert] This was the peak of Mayweather's
career, where he just went 50-0,

35:07.772 --> 35:09.190
and Sam was like, "I can get him."

35:09.273 --> 35:12.443
-We're like, "Get the fuck out of here."
-We know how to network, guys.

35:12.527 --> 35:15.530
We know how to be able to put
the connectivities of brands to us.

35:16.030 --> 35:18.282
Oh, what's up, champ?
How's everything, boss?

35:18.366 --> 35:21.285
He's down, and he, you know,
he obviously wants a lot of money,

35:21.369 --> 35:23.204
and we're, like, trying
to secure the deal.

35:23.287 --> 35:26.249
We ended up
somehow pitching Floyd Mayweather

35:26.332 --> 35:30.336
to take 200,000 in cash
and take 800,000 in Centracoins.

35:30.419 --> 35:33.047
You know, he's not the brightest guy,
so he accepts it.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.133
[music continues]

35:39.053 --> 35:43.391
What's up? It's the one and only…
your man, Floyd "Money" Mayweather.

35:45.601 --> 35:47.979
I get my card out, my Centra Card.

35:49.397 --> 35:50.356
Bitcoin.

35:51.023 --> 35:53.860
The new way things are done.
Floyd "Money" Mayweather.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.779
As y'all can see,
the number changed from before.

35:56.863 --> 36:00.408
He does a commercial,
and the commercial goes crazy for us.

36:02.118 --> 36:05.037
[Jacob] It was an amazing thing.
I mean, any good publicity

36:05.121 --> 36:07.665
that's going to pump your coin
is gonna make you more wealthy.

36:09.750 --> 36:12.503
This is a huge moment for Centra.

36:12.587 --> 36:15.006
So let's see
how they capitalize off of that.

36:15.089 --> 36:18.009
So I'm in the lab.
My man put me up on this Centra vibe.

36:18.092 --> 36:20.761
Then we secured the second
endorsement deal with DJ Khaled.

36:20.845 --> 36:23.723
The Centra vibe
is that Bitcoin, I'm sayin'.

36:23.806 --> 36:25.808
[music continues]

36:28.603 --> 36:31.272
You know, I started like that.
That's that Billy talk.

36:31.772 --> 36:34.400
[Ray] Instantly, millions of dollars
are coming in.

36:35.276 --> 36:38.279
We're making
millions of dollars… every day.

36:39.488 --> 36:44.160
This is such a revolutionary technology.
You can't really stop it.

36:46.329 --> 36:48.623
[Mayweather chuckles] Yes, I told y'all.

36:49.624 --> 36:53.544
Got my Centra Card. Bitcoin.
I'm doing big thing.

36:53.628 --> 36:56.172
[Popper]
When I first started covering this,

36:56.255 --> 36:57.506
my starting point was,

36:58.132 --> 37:00.092
I'm gonna look at these coins

37:00.176 --> 37:03.638
that are getting
endorsements from celebrities.

37:04.847 --> 37:06.682
It just didn't make sense.

37:07.767 --> 37:12.605
You had the people in the world who have
to know the least about technology,

37:12.688 --> 37:18.444
pretending as though they are some sort
of experts on which of these projects

37:18.527 --> 37:22.365
are the right ones for you to put
your millions of dollars into.

37:22.448 --> 37:25.368
And it was clear
they were all getting paid to do this.

37:25.451 --> 37:28.287
They have to disclose
that they're getting paid

37:28.371 --> 37:31.332
if they're gonna promote
something on social media.

37:31.415 --> 37:32.833
Somebody needs to dig into this

37:32.917 --> 37:35.169
and figure out
what the hell is going on here.

37:36.128 --> 37:38.798
This one project stood out.

37:38.881 --> 37:41.968
The Centra vibe
is that Bitcoin, I'm sayin'…

37:42.593 --> 37:44.178
[keyboard clacking]

37:45.054 --> 37:46.264
[Popper] Things looked funny.

37:46.347 --> 37:48.432
[pensive music playing]

37:48.516 --> 37:51.018
You just went to their website,

37:51.602 --> 37:54.563
you scrolled down
and looked at the pictures

37:54.647 --> 37:57.692
they had of their staff and founders.

37:57.775 --> 38:00.403
The pictures didn't even
look like real people.

38:00.486 --> 38:05.283
And then they had the LinkedIn profile
for each of these employees.

38:05.366 --> 38:07.827
The ones
where the LinkedIn accounts did work,

38:07.910 --> 38:11.956
the employees all had
degrees from Harvard,

38:12.039 --> 38:15.209
and they were executives at Wells Fargo.

38:15.293 --> 38:20.339
I mean, nobody at Wells Fargo was working
in the cryptocurrency universe.

38:20.423 --> 38:23.259
It just-- None of it seemed plausible.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.595
I found these Instagram accounts

38:26.679 --> 38:31.142
that made it clear
that their LinkedIns were totally untrue

38:31.225 --> 38:34.854
and that, in fact, they worked
at some sort of car dealership.

38:34.937 --> 38:37.106
So I started digging further.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.817
[line ringing]

38:39.900 --> 38:43.112
One day, I got a call
from an author for the New York Times.

38:43.195 --> 38:46.907
"Hey, we're doing a story
on celebrities involved in crypto."

38:46.991 --> 38:48.367
So I put Ray the phone.

38:49.285 --> 38:50.578
[Ray] Hi, how you doing?

38:50.661 --> 38:52.079
[Popper] Hey, that's Ray?

38:52.747 --> 38:54.081
[Ray] Yeah, speaking. How are you?

38:54.165 --> 38:56.208
[Popper] You have a second to talk?
Endorsements--

38:56.292 --> 38:58.961
-[Ray] What company are you from?
-[Popper] The New York Times.

38:59.045 --> 39:02.131
-[Ray] All right. What's your name, sir?
-Nathaniel Popper.

39:02.631 --> 39:04.550
[Ray] You're an author
for the New York Times?

39:04.633 --> 39:06.427
[Popper] I'm a reporter
for the New York Times.

39:06.510 --> 39:10.348
I've been reporting on Bitcoin
and blockchain stuff for several years.

39:10.431 --> 39:13.100
-[Ray] So you know your stuff. I get you.
-[Popper] I'm following--

39:13.184 --> 39:16.812
[Ray] Centra, in my opinion,
is the future of cryptocurrency

39:16.896 --> 39:19.857
and the financial industry
at the same time.

39:19.940 --> 39:22.318
[Popper] Okay. Um, good, well, um--

39:22.401 --> 39:24.362
[Ray] It's gonna be able to make cards

39:24.445 --> 39:27.573
that they're able to spend
their cryptocurrency on in real time.

39:27.656 --> 39:29.784
Just like an iPhone
coming to the world in--

39:29.867 --> 39:31.243
[Popper] Um, mm-hmm.

39:31.327 --> 39:33.954
Yeah, it felt great.
New York Times? We're all from New York.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.373
You know, how can you beat that?

39:35.456 --> 39:36.457
Whoa.

39:36.540 --> 39:37.625
It was amazing.

39:37.708 --> 39:42.046
A great opportunity to get our name out
to the United States market.

39:42.129 --> 39:43.923
They want to send a photographer over.

39:44.006 --> 39:45.966
I said, "No problem.
You know, send them over."

39:46.050 --> 39:48.719
"Sorbee will come to the office,
and we'll all take these pictures."

39:50.596 --> 39:54.975
[Popper] After my first call,
I told the photographer to rush down there

39:55.059 --> 39:59.397
to get the photos before they,
sort of, second-guessed all this.

40:01.482 --> 40:03.067
And their offices actually existed.

40:04.151 --> 40:07.947
It really seemed like
this had started as a scam,

40:08.030 --> 40:10.366
and then they suddenly started to think,

40:10.449 --> 40:14.537
"You know what, maybe we'll just do this.
Maybe we'll just make a credit card."

40:14.620 --> 40:17.123
Anybody can come here to our offices.
Doors are open.

40:17.206 --> 40:19.667
You can meet the staff.
They're intelligent people.

40:20.251 --> 40:21.919
[Popper] Let's hire some programmers

40:22.002 --> 40:25.089
and put something on the blockchain,
and we'll create the next bank.

40:25.172 --> 40:29.552
Even though no part of the building blocks
that they were working from were real.

40:31.095 --> 40:33.222
[Ray] We all got, like, our best suits on.

40:33.305 --> 40:35.307
[wondrous music playing]

40:35.391 --> 40:36.267
[shutter clicks]

40:52.324 --> 40:54.452
[music fades]

40:54.535 --> 40:55.411
[car engine revving]

40:56.579 --> 40:58.080
[Kerri] Yeah, it was exciting

40:58.164 --> 41:01.500
because I saw, you know, the spiral down
after Miami Exotics,

41:01.584 --> 41:02.877
and now he's feeling good.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.254
He was making money. He was successful.

41:05.337 --> 41:08.382
[Pat] Ray came to the door.
He had a Harvard shirt on.

41:08.466 --> 41:12.261
I said, "Where did you get that?"
He says, "Oh, online." [chuckles]

41:12.344 --> 41:15.181
Then he started laughing.
He said, "I went to Harvard."

41:15.806 --> 41:18.142
"I started this big company."

41:18.809 --> 41:22.980
It was just kind of, "Okay, let's hope
that everything's gonna be okay."

41:23.481 --> 41:24.857
[car engine revving]

41:24.940 --> 41:26.942
[phone ringing]

41:28.569 --> 41:30.237
[Popper] Um, Ray?

41:30.988 --> 41:35.451
I've been coming across other questions
that have come up around Centra.

41:35.534 --> 41:37.870
The first thing is Visa has said

41:37.953 --> 41:40.873
nobody has applied to issue a Centra Card.

41:42.374 --> 41:45.586
[Ray] I mean, I… I know--
I know details about that.

41:45.669 --> 41:47.213
I mean, you know, I mean--

41:47.796 --> 41:51.342
But, I mean, I… I can't give you
direct answers on that.

41:52.510 --> 41:56.764
These guys say
that they're issuing a card with Visa.

41:56.847 --> 41:58.599
They have pictures up on their website

41:58.682 --> 42:01.185
that have cards
that have the Visa logo on it.

42:01.268 --> 42:04.063
One of the first things I did
was call Visa.

42:04.146 --> 42:07.107
They said, "We have no idea
who these guys are,

42:07.191 --> 42:10.110
and there is no record of an application."

42:10.194 --> 42:12.404
"They're gonna have to take
that off of their website."

42:13.489 --> 42:15.574
[Ray spluttering] I can't…

42:17.117 --> 42:18.786
[Popper] Okay, I mean Visa's just saying

42:18.869 --> 42:22.248
this company Centra is not allowed
to issue a card with Visa on it.

42:22.331 --> 42:25.459
[Ray] Till we do the mass order,
they're never gonna speak on that.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.879
Anytime somebody tells you, you know,

42:28.963 --> 42:32.174
"I… I don't really feel comfortable
answering that question,"

42:32.258 --> 42:33.884
or, "These are questions that are very…"

42:33.968 --> 42:37.429
[Ray] Very, very tough for me
to answer here. You know, I mean, like--

42:37.513 --> 42:40.057
…you know
that there's something going on here.

42:40.140 --> 42:41.976
[pensive music playing]

42:42.059 --> 42:46.230
I was looking at this and just trying
to come up with an explanation

42:46.313 --> 42:51.443
that could sort of plausibly explain
how they had raised that kind of money…

42:51.527 --> 42:54.697
[Clif] And the channel is "Clif_High."

42:54.780 --> 43:00.077
…when it was
so clearly fraudulent and a lie.

43:00.661 --> 43:03.330
[Ray] You know? And then
once we went public, what happened?

43:03.414 --> 43:05.457
I mean, overnight it blew up.

43:05.541 --> 43:08.085
Bang, one of the biggest guys
in crypto wrote,

43:08.168 --> 43:11.088
"Centra Tech is the best company
in the world to invest in."

43:11.171 --> 43:14.425
It got us to where we are now,
which is a big chunk of change.

43:14.508 --> 43:15.467
[Popper] Okay.

43:15.551 --> 43:18.971
A lot of corporations are gonna die.
Lots and lots of them.

43:19.054 --> 43:22.141
Along with some of the Cryptos, right? Um…

43:22.224 --> 43:26.979
Clif High understood this project
and, you know, believed in the project…

43:27.062 --> 43:28.689
[arcade game music plays]

43:28.772 --> 43:32.359
…and then realized that it was

43:33.152 --> 43:34.194
a scam.

43:34.278 --> 43:35.904
-[tense music plays]
-[printer clatters]

43:39.867 --> 43:41.201
The shit hit the fan with Clif.

43:41.285 --> 43:42.911
[Ray] The whole article was a fuck-up.

43:42.995 --> 43:45.497
I… I probably never even read
the fucking full article.

43:45.581 --> 43:47.082
[whirring]

43:47.166 --> 43:49.877
[Jonny] Clif High used
these things called web bots,

43:49.960 --> 43:53.255
which make AI-generated summaries
of news articles.

43:53.922 --> 43:55.758
This web bot fucked up

43:55.841 --> 43:59.803
and put Centra's name in this article
about this bank called Centra.

44:00.429 --> 44:04.892
Clif High had thought this bank was part
of them, which would have been huge news.

44:04.975 --> 44:08.687
Imagine if Bank of America, or something,
partnered with, like, Ethereum.

44:10.064 --> 44:14.443
Clif High reaches out and was like,
"Hey, I fucked up big time."

44:14.526 --> 44:17.905
Clif reaches out to us,
and he asks if we can go live with him

44:17.988 --> 44:19.490
in front of an audience.

44:19.573 --> 44:22.076
And we agree.
We agree to it. We're like, "Fuck it."

44:22.159 --> 44:25.120
Like, how bad can it go?
Sorbee's very good at talking.

44:25.204 --> 44:27.498
You know, we've had people
ask us questions so many times,

44:27.581 --> 44:28.874
and it always goes so well.

44:29.750 --> 44:32.503
And then the first thing
Sorbee says in that call is…

44:32.586 --> 44:35.798
We are one hundred percent not a scam.

44:35.881 --> 44:40.177
Starting off saying "this is not a scam"
is the most bizarre thing in the world.

44:41.220 --> 44:44.014
No one ever says that
unless it's actually a scam.

44:44.098 --> 44:46.934
Okay, that's… that's fine, that's fine,
but your statements…

44:47.017 --> 44:48.477
your statements don't mean anything.

44:48.560 --> 44:51.480
You stating you're not a scam
in no way proves you're not a scam.

44:51.563 --> 44:54.733
I'm not here to scam anybody.
I wouldn't have raised $4.5 million,

44:54.817 --> 44:56.151
came on here to scam anybody.

44:56.235 --> 44:58.946
[Clif] You're listed as the Chief
Technical Officer on LinkedIn.

44:59.029 --> 45:01.782
And for some reason,
you're still using an email account

45:01.865 --> 45:04.201
from a business, uh,
that is a car dealership.

45:04.284 --> 45:05.119
[laughing]

45:05.202 --> 45:07.913
[Clif] I don't think you have
your technical, uh, shit together here.

45:08.497 --> 45:11.500
What have you got in the way of equipment?
What's your server farm like?

45:11.583 --> 45:12.793
I don't know the details of it.

45:12.876 --> 45:14.878
The tech director
that did that for me, to be honest.

45:14.962 --> 45:17.589
-I'm a startup. I haven't been--
-Jesus Christ.

45:17.673 --> 45:19.800
I've been in business
less than a year and a half.

45:19.883 --> 45:21.885
[Ray] He asked about the bank contracts.

45:21.969 --> 45:24.263
-[Clif] My question comes to this--
-[Sorbee] Bancorp Bank--

45:24.346 --> 45:25.931
Absolutely. I'm getting right to it.

45:26.014 --> 45:27.599
Bancorp Bank, they're our managers.

45:27.683 --> 45:30.018
And we go directly through
their licensing agreement.

45:30.102 --> 45:33.689
[Clif] So that locks you out of, like,
34 states instantly because of the costs.

45:33.772 --> 45:35.441
Not 34. It's 36 states.

45:35.524 --> 45:40.195
So it's about… it's about 28 states.
Because there's 51, 52 states, I think.

45:40.279 --> 45:41.280
-Right?
-[laughs]

45:41.363 --> 45:42.906
[Clif] All right, guy. [laughs]

45:42.990 --> 45:45.784
I'm not good with words, okay?
Let's just make it blunt and honest.

45:45.868 --> 45:47.661
I haven't-- I just know what we're doing.

45:47.745 --> 45:49.455
You're not a…
You're not a software engineer,

45:49.538 --> 45:51.039
you're not a coder, not a blockchain--

45:51.123 --> 45:53.250
Me personally, no. And I… I told you that.

45:53.333 --> 45:56.253
I'm the guy who leads them
to be able to design my vision.

45:56.336 --> 45:58.881
[Clif] So Mike doesn't do shit then?
Why is he the CEO?

45:58.964 --> 46:01.925
-To be honest, he's the money dude.
-And what's his role in this?

46:02.009 --> 46:04.720
Mike… Mike…
Mike was, honestly, an investor

46:04.803 --> 46:06.138
who saw my vision and said,

46:06.221 --> 46:07.973
"You know what?
I'm gonna do this for you."

46:08.056 --> 46:10.225
He gave me the opportunity
to get where I am today.

46:10.309 --> 46:12.519
We're not the brightest, smartest people.

46:12.603 --> 46:15.355
-We're not gonna sit here and say we are.
-[Clif] Why bring that up?

46:15.439 --> 46:17.649
[Sorbee] I went and did my due diligence…

46:19.193 --> 46:23.030
I didn't wanna believe anybody in this
universe until they prove things to me,

46:23.113 --> 46:27.868
so I immediately start asking
about their alleged CEO, Michael Edwards.

46:27.951 --> 46:29.119
[line ringing]

46:29.203 --> 46:33.165
Michael Edwards, is he, um, I mean,
is he someone I can speak to?

46:33.248 --> 46:36.585
Just so I can understand, sort of,
his role and what his view of this is.

46:36.668 --> 46:40.130
[Ray] He stops by the office, you know,
once in a while to check up on things.

46:40.214 --> 46:42.925
In regards to speaking to him,
what do you wanna speak to him about?

46:43.008 --> 46:46.261
[Popper] I'm just wondering if there's
a person there that I could talk to?

46:46.345 --> 46:48.055
[Ray] Yeah,
I can probably put that together.

46:48.138 --> 46:51.266
Only in regards to, you know, being
that it's a New York Times article.

46:51.350 --> 46:54.978
[Popper] I mean, you had him as your CEO.
Is he still your CEO?

46:55.062 --> 46:59.691
[Ray] He's more of our original money guy
before we got everything in place.

46:59.775 --> 47:01.401
[pensive music playing]

47:01.485 --> 47:04.196
There was so much heat on us
that we knew we're just trying to remove

47:04.279 --> 47:07.157
everything that was fake,
every misrepresentation, all at once.

47:07.241 --> 47:10.035
[pensive music continues]

47:15.958 --> 47:17.626
We gotta clear all the Fufu.

47:17.709 --> 47:20.003
[enchanting music playing]

47:20.087 --> 47:21.839
Fugazi, fake stuff. [chuckles]

47:23.340 --> 47:25.801
Bancorp was the bank
that we had listed on our website.

47:25.884 --> 47:28.971
They faked that too, so I would
just get out while I still could.

47:29.638 --> 47:33.058
[Robert] For the prototype card,
Sam used Bancorp prepaid cards.

47:33.141 --> 47:35.686
So he was like,
"Fuck it. Let's just say Bancorp."

47:35.769 --> 47:37.271
Because technically, it was Bancorp.

47:37.354 --> 47:38.313
[Sorbee] Approved.

47:39.314 --> 47:41.650
[Robert] And one day,
we got a cease and desist

47:41.733 --> 47:42.985
from the Bancorp Bank.

47:46.738 --> 47:48.448
It was pretty nerve-wracking.

47:51.910 --> 47:55.122
Sam found a law firm called Pope and Dunn.

47:57.374 --> 48:01.169
They were a super reputable firm
out of New York on Water Street.

48:01.879 --> 48:04.214
Eric Pope was this ex-SEC attorney.

48:04.298 --> 48:05.132
[phone ringing]

48:05.215 --> 48:07.593
A smart, witty guy on the phone.

48:07.676 --> 48:10.512
He said, "Listen,
I'm gonna handle all your legal stuff."

48:10.596 --> 48:14.516
You know, he consoled us about any hiccups
that we had early on in the company.

48:15.058 --> 48:18.061
[Eric] We're definitely on top of it.
We have the best legal team on top of it.

48:19.521 --> 48:22.065
[Robert]
We sent the cease and desist to Eric Pope.

48:22.149 --> 48:25.944
"Eric, what do we do?"
He said, "Just take it off your website."

48:26.028 --> 48:29.239
"Don't worry about it. Just abide by
the cease and desist and keep moving."

48:31.283 --> 48:34.745
[Jacob] I started noticing that things
were changing on their website.

48:35.245 --> 48:37.873
Bancorp disappeared off their white paper.

48:37.956 --> 48:38.957
Why is that gone?

48:40.083 --> 48:41.001
What's going on here?

48:41.084 --> 48:43.420
Where's the technology
that you're promising?

48:45.964 --> 48:47.966
[music fades]

48:48.050 --> 48:49.468
[crickets chirping]

48:49.551 --> 48:51.845
[Sorbee] We have reasons
we don't disclose certain things.

48:51.929 --> 48:54.890
We have technology to protect.
Our technology is our backbone.

48:54.973 --> 48:57.100
Without our technology,
we don't have a product.

48:57.184 --> 49:00.354
Our goal is not to not be transparent.
Because we understand

49:00.437 --> 49:02.689
how cryptocurrency
can take non-transparency

49:02.773 --> 49:04.816
and run with it as a scam, so we get that.

49:04.900 --> 49:06.902
[suspenseful music playing]

49:08.779 --> 49:10.614
[Ray] Everything that
we would go back to, like,

49:10.697 --> 49:12.449
when we'd get caught
into something was like,

49:12.532 --> 49:14.660
"Oh yeah, it's great
we have Michael Edwards

49:14.743 --> 49:16.453
to rely on for all this advice,

49:16.536 --> 49:18.497
and he's really bringing
our vision to life here."

49:18.580 --> 49:20.832
So I'm gonna go back to reading
some of the questions

49:20.916 --> 49:23.919
to see what people have been asking.
So I'm just gonna scroll up top.

49:24.002 --> 49:26.713
[contemplative music continues]

49:28.465 --> 49:30.842
[Ray] Of course,
people wanted to meet Michael Edwards.

49:30.926 --> 49:32.177
[exhales]

49:39.893 --> 49:43.230
People would come into our chats
talking shit. Just talk and talk.

49:43.313 --> 49:46.400
"When are you gonna have Michael Edwards
come on and talk to everybody?

49:46.483 --> 49:48.902
"Did he work here?
Did he go to this college?"

49:48.986 --> 49:51.571
"Is there somebody named Michael Edwards

49:51.655 --> 49:55.575
who lives in Miami,
who is this age, who has this picture?"

49:55.659 --> 49:59.121
[man]
Where is the alleged co-founder and CEO?

49:59.204 --> 50:00.414
"Michael Edwards."

50:01.081 --> 50:04.334
That's when we… we really knew
that we had to get rid of Michael Edwards

50:04.418 --> 50:05.335
as soon as possible.

50:05.419 --> 50:07.462
[contemplative music continues]

50:21.143 --> 50:24.021
[dramatic music plays]

50:24.104 --> 50:25.480
Stupid mistake.

50:25.981 --> 50:27.983
[contemplative music continues]

50:30.777 --> 50:32.237
[Ray] Put out a press release.

50:32.904 --> 50:35.824
Michael Edwards, our CEO,
died in a car accident.

50:35.907 --> 50:38.785
It was a crazy, terrible car accident.
God bless the dead.

50:38.869 --> 50:40.579
And, you know, that was that.

50:46.001 --> 50:47.044
[music ends]

50:48.253 --> 50:50.255
[footsteps approaching]

50:56.636 --> 50:57.471
Hello.

50:58.096 --> 50:59.431
I'm Michael Edwards,

50:59.514 --> 51:02.309
founder and CEO of Centra Tech.

51:04.144 --> 51:06.480
[interviewer] Is that, uh,
who you really are?

51:07.522 --> 51:09.399
No, that's not who I really am.

51:10.025 --> 51:14.112
I'm Dr. Andrew Halayko. I'm a professor
at the University of Manitoba.

51:14.905 --> 51:19.785
"On August 25th,
Michael Edwards suddenly left this world."

51:19.868 --> 51:22.871
"He leaves behind
his French bulldog, Stanley,

51:23.538 --> 51:26.875
and an accomplished career
as an investor and VP

51:26.958 --> 51:28.543
for Wells Fargo and Chase."

51:28.627 --> 51:32.506
"He graduated with an MBA
from Harvard University,

51:32.589 --> 51:36.301
which prepared him
for his most recent venture as co-founder

51:36.384 --> 51:41.098
and chief executive officer
of Centra Tech in Miami Beach, Florida."

51:42.724 --> 51:44.017
That's pretty creepy.

51:44.101 --> 51:45.560
Uh… [chuckles]

51:46.728 --> 51:48.688
Wow. Well, at least I had an MBA,

51:48.772 --> 51:51.858
and I was…
I was well-trained at Harvard. [chuckles]

51:51.942 --> 51:55.612
I hadn't realized that they had
actually gone to that extent.

51:55.695 --> 51:56.530
Um…

51:57.405 --> 52:01.118
Michael Edwards was never
even a real person, not at all.

52:02.369 --> 52:04.412
We completely created him from scratch.

52:04.996 --> 52:07.207
The photos for Michael Edwards
were just taken off Google.

52:07.290 --> 52:09.000
We just looked up "old white guy…"

52:09.668 --> 52:10.877
[keyboard clacking]

52:10.961 --> 52:14.005
…looked at all the images,
and found an old white guy. [laughing]

52:14.589 --> 52:17.467
And just took that image,
and, you know, that was Michael Edwards.

52:18.510 --> 52:19.553
[chuckles]

52:19.636 --> 52:21.805
[pensive music playing]

52:21.888 --> 52:24.724
[Dr. Halayko] It's infuriating
that you are being manipulated

52:25.225 --> 52:27.978
and used to someone else's benefit.

52:28.937 --> 52:31.439
[Ray]
After Michael Edwards was killed off,

52:31.523 --> 52:34.025
what we were trying to do
is find a new CEO.

52:35.777 --> 52:39.698
And that's where we asked my grandfather
if he wanted to be the CEO of the company.

52:39.781 --> 52:42.242
And at the time, he had cancer,
so, like, he really didn't care.

52:42.325 --> 52:44.286
He was like, "Fuck it.
Yeah, just put me up there."

52:44.369 --> 52:45.871
You know, we took his picture.

52:47.539 --> 52:49.416
And we had a new CEO.

52:49.499 --> 52:51.209
[suspenseful music playing]

53:01.636 --> 53:05.515
[Popper] Um, so look, since we last spoke,

53:05.599 --> 53:10.061
the original CEO, Michael Edwards, um,
his picture was the picture

53:10.145 --> 53:13.440
of this guy from Canada
who wasn't named Michael Edwards.

53:13.523 --> 53:17.527
I saw that you deleted the original
LinkedIn profile that he had up.

53:17.611 --> 53:18.862
[Ray] You see, that's the thing.

53:18.945 --> 53:21.364
[spluttering]
He wanted to be a ghost investor.

53:21.448 --> 53:24.910
[Popper] But that LinkedIn profile
disappeared then, right?

53:25.493 --> 53:28.246
[Ray] When… When was that?
I'm not… I'm not even sure about that.

53:28.330 --> 53:30.832
-[Popper] There was a LinkedIn--
-[Ray] I just have one question.

53:30.916 --> 53:34.044
Where… Where are you getting at with the…
like, the… the end point of this?

53:34.127 --> 53:34.961
[Popper] Um…

53:35.545 --> 53:37.422
[Jacob] After Michael Edwards passed,

53:37.505 --> 53:39.883
I needed to know who William Hagner was.

53:41.426 --> 53:44.763
I researched the founders,
whatever I could find.

53:44.846 --> 53:46.973
[keyboard clacking]

53:48.850 --> 53:52.229
I started looking into Raymond Trapani
and his entire background

53:52.312 --> 53:54.105
on his Facebook page.

53:56.316 --> 53:58.526
Wow, what is this?

53:59.027 --> 54:01.905
William Hagner
is actually Raymond's grandfather.

54:02.739 --> 54:04.407
It was very suspicious.

54:07.661 --> 54:09.955
I was sounding the alarm
in the Slack channel.

54:10.038 --> 54:10.872
[keyboard clacking]

54:12.707 --> 54:14.417
[Robert] We were getting some backlash.

54:15.669 --> 54:18.046
There was always, like, a troll
that we had to shut up.

54:18.588 --> 54:20.090
People say they don't have a CEO.

54:20.173 --> 54:24.261
There's a few other things that people
think there's a fraud involved here.

54:24.344 --> 54:27.055
[Jacob] There was a post
on a YouTube channel

54:27.138 --> 54:29.683
breaking down everything on the website
that didn't make sense.

54:29.766 --> 54:32.978
I'm not too concerned
about YouTube and Reddit.

54:33.061 --> 54:34.562
We're not gonna engage with this.

54:34.646 --> 54:35.814
[Jacob] When that came out,

54:35.897 --> 54:39.359
Centra Tech offered money
to take this down,

54:39.442 --> 54:42.362
and then he took that,
and he posted it onto Slack.

54:44.239 --> 54:48.076
It's like, "Hey look. I just got offered
by them money to take this down."

54:50.078 --> 54:51.830
[suspenseful music continues]

54:51.913 --> 54:56.293
[Robert] Every day there was somebody
spreading FUD in all our chats.

54:56.376 --> 54:58.211
Fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

54:59.796 --> 55:03.591
And a lot of these trolls, we actually
turned them into Centra believers.

55:04.551 --> 55:06.886
[interviewer] Was that by paying them?

55:06.970 --> 55:09.180
Did you pay them
to remove unfavorable posts?

55:10.390 --> 55:11.975
I don't know about that. [laughs]

55:12.058 --> 55:14.477
[Ray] We were paying people off all day.
That's all we did.

55:14.561 --> 55:17.480
"I know this is all bullshit,
but here's, you know, twenty grand."

55:17.564 --> 55:19.316
"Can you fucking take this shit down?"

55:20.442 --> 55:22.193
[Jacob] "Where did your partnerships go?"

55:22.277 --> 55:24.738
"Where is the actual proof
that this works?"

55:25.405 --> 55:29.617
And as I continue to push that, uh,
people were getting upset.

55:29.701 --> 55:31.494
I feel bad for you guys.

55:31.578 --> 55:33.496
You guys have nothing better to do
with your lives

55:33.580 --> 55:35.790
than try to troll a company.

55:35.874 --> 55:38.585
[Jacob] They were basically saying,
"Oh, I'm spreading FUD."

55:39.085 --> 55:40.503
[Ray] Anytime that's in a chat room,

55:40.587 --> 55:43.381
you're just trying to get that out
of the chat room as fast as possible.

55:43.465 --> 55:45.842
You know, some people,
you can just tell right off the bat

55:45.925 --> 55:47.177
they're not gonna be bought.

55:47.260 --> 55:49.971
And they decided
it would just be worth it to ban me

55:50.055 --> 55:51.848
so I could no longer spread FUD.

55:54.184 --> 55:56.436
I was extremely angry.

55:56.519 --> 55:57.645
These people are awful.

55:57.729 --> 55:59.731
[tense music playing]

56:13.828 --> 56:17.582
I was a… I was a…a dirtbag
when I was younger.

56:17.665 --> 56:20.085
More like a Raymond Trapani, if you will.

56:21.169 --> 56:23.797
A lot changed
when I went on my first deployment

56:23.880 --> 56:25.507
and experienced what I did.

56:27.300 --> 56:28.385
[shell casing clinks]

56:28.468 --> 56:29.719
I was in Afghanistan.

56:30.804 --> 56:33.556
Loss takes you aback,

56:33.640 --> 56:36.101
and you really have to question,
what are you here for?

56:36.768 --> 56:40.355
It just changed, uh, everything…
pretty quickly.

56:41.898 --> 56:45.360
We all have to grow at some point
to have something to live for

56:45.443 --> 56:46.444
other than money.

56:47.153 --> 56:49.489
It can buy you a lot of things,
but at the end of the day,

56:49.572 --> 56:54.327
the… the person that you were in life
will outlive the money that you have.

56:56.704 --> 56:58.039
After I got banned,

56:58.957 --> 57:01.501
I became obsessed with Centra and, uh,

57:02.669 --> 57:04.504
absolutely wanted to take them down.

57:05.088 --> 57:06.047
[gun fires]

57:09.676 --> 57:12.137
Yeah, it was a personal vendetta
at that point.

57:12.220 --> 57:14.222
[tense music continues]

57:20.979 --> 57:24.816
[man on video] So the two main guys
who recently completed the Centra ICO,

57:24.899 --> 57:28.278
they're basically just scam artists.
So be careful.

57:29.154 --> 57:32.365
[Ray] You know, day-to-day, there would be
people making YouTube videos

57:32.449 --> 57:36.077
about how Centra is doing this wrong,
and these contracts aren't real.

57:36.161 --> 57:39.330
You know, at that moment
I remember just thinking in my head, like,

57:39.414 --> 57:40.957
this is the end of it.

57:43.960 --> 57:46.588
And, out of nowhere…

57:46.671 --> 57:49.299
[hopeful music playing]

57:52.927 --> 57:54.596
…fucking South Korea.

[Robert] Bitsset, a South Korean company.

58:08.443 --> 58:11.112
There wasn't a lot
of information about them,

58:11.196 --> 58:12.822
but we knew they had a lot of money.

58:12.906 --> 58:17.160
They loved Centra Tech, and they wanted
to help us grow in the Asian market.

58:17.827 --> 58:20.330
[Ray] They'll invest
five million dollars upfront,

58:20.413 --> 58:23.666
and then you guys will come to Korea
and show us proof of concept,

58:23.750 --> 58:25.251
and then we'll invest the rest.

58:25.752 --> 58:28.046
So they invested five million.

58:28.129 --> 58:30.006
And from there, we're like,

58:30.089 --> 58:33.843
"All right, we're going to fly down
to Korea and get the shit going." So…

58:34.719 --> 58:37.597

"We have to have an app now."

58:38.848 --> 58:39.974
[uplifting music playing]

58:40.058 --> 58:41.017
[Ray] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:41.100 --> 58:44.270
We had already created
a fake app for other presentations,

58:44.854 --> 58:48.775
so that we could make a video
and show that on the app, "Oh, look…"

58:48.858 --> 58:50.360
[whirs, beeps]

58:50.443 --> 58:54.113
"The correct amount of Bitcoin
is being removed after I swipe my card."

58:56.783 --> 58:58.493
But we needed a better fake app.

58:58.576 --> 59:00.578
[gentle music playing]

59:02.288 --> 59:06.709
We were given task. "Can you create us
interface when we press a button,

59:06.793 --> 59:08.878
that it proves the concept that works?"

59:08.962 --> 59:11.506
We were building
the application with the deadline.

59:11.589 --> 59:15.218
At that one moment they told us they will
go to Korea to test the application.

59:15.301 --> 59:17.887
They were worried about will this work.

59:19.472 --> 59:24.310
To prove the concept that works, he had
people in-house to enter data manually.

59:25.812 --> 59:27.772
I'm not sure you can count it as fake.

59:28.815 --> 59:31.526
It was working but not scalable.

59:32.610 --> 59:33.945
It's just a prototype.

59:35.113 --> 59:37.824
[Ray] We put our whole technology team.

59:37.907 --> 59:39.742
We took their focus off the real app

59:40.243 --> 59:42.620
and made them
focus on building a fake app…

59:44.455 --> 59:47.959
that would work in real-time
when Sorbee was going to Korea.

59:48.459 --> 59:50.837
[interviewer] Why not have them
keep focusing on the real app?

59:50.920 --> 59:51.838

59:51.921 --> 59:54.716
I was just sitting there like,
"Oh shit, Korea."

59:54.799 --> 59:56.217
[gentle music continues]

01:00:00.388 --> 01:00:01.848
[Ray] I was not going to South Korea.

01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:04.517
I don't really like
going into foreign territories

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:07.812
when, you know, you're not doing
something that's legitimate.

01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:13.109
Sounds risky. [sighs]

01:00:13.192 --> 01:00:14.652
We send Sorbee.

01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:17.155
[Robert] He was like,
"Hold down the office. I'm out of here."

01:00:17.238 --> 01:00:19.449
He just jumped on a flight
and went there by himself.

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:22.035
They don't have dick.

01:00:22.535 --> 01:00:25.330
So they make an app
that charges your debit card

01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:28.082
and makes it seem like
it's spending your crypto directly.

01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:29.334
[Ray] We take that debit card.

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:32.253
We send it to a guy in California,
made it into a metal Centra Card.

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:34.964
Now we have this metal Centra Card
that when we swipe it,

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:36.966
it just takes money from our bank account.

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:40.970
We would just press a button
so that it presents as it's a real app

01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:42.305
and it's working correctly.

01:00:42.388 --> 01:00:46.684
So on our end, we just had to do
all those transactions behind the scenes.

01:00:46.768 --> 01:00:50.188
So we're going to transfer
that value that you guys, you know…

01:00:50.271 --> 01:00:51.898
[Ray] So now he's down in Korea.

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:53.066

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:55.360

a filmed presentation

01:00:55.443 --> 01:00:57.111
in front of their team.

01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:02.575
I believe that a partnership
with Centra Tech and Bitsset

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.410

When you search Centra on the internet,

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:11.876

And what are your thoughts
regarding the accusation?

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:21.511
[Sorbee in English] A lot of
the accusations came from competitors

01:01:21.594 --> 01:01:23.971
that felt that our product was a threat.

01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:27.350
The Centra Card is the world's
best cryptocurrency debit card.

01:01:27.433 --> 01:01:29.102
These accusations are false.

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:30.561
It was pretty stressful. [chuckles]

01:08:29.438 --> 01:08:31.774
pissed him off even more
because he realized that

01:08:32.983 --> 01:08:34.610
he's not a… a good guy.

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:39.782
[music fades]

01:08:39.865 --> 01:08:42.076
[man] The New York Times article
was really important.

01:08:42.159 --> 01:08:44.203
When things get
that kind of public attention,

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:47.248
and there's that big of a question
about whether something's real,

01:08:47.331 --> 01:08:49.333
and when people
are raising a lot of money,

01:08:49.416 --> 01:08:50.835
that makes the SEC interested.

01:08:50.918 --> 01:08:53.712
There was an aspect
of Centra that was really brazen.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:58.676
They were saying things that did not take
a lot of work to prove were not true,

01:08:58.759 --> 01:09:01.512
like relationships
with credit card companies and banks.

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:04.807
Using photos of fake people
with fake biographies

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:07.518
and thinking that
that was going to work long term.

01:09:07.601 --> 01:09:10.896
It's just hard to understand
how anyone would think that would work.

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:12.231
And maybe they were joking,

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:15.276
but to make up a story
that the CEO died in an accident…

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:20.072
that that would work,
it… it's just hard to imagine.

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:23.033
We are fully on board
with any regulatory bodies

01:09:23.117 --> 01:09:24.869
to make sure everything's done correctly.

01:09:24.952 --> 01:09:28.747
Centra's here to last for a long time.
We're doing everything we can by the book.

01:09:29.373 --> 01:09:32.877
[Ray] Centra was completely
illegitimate nonsense at first.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.337
But once we started
generating millions of dollars,

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:38.132
we saw that there was actually
a chance to go fully legit.

01:09:38.215 --> 01:09:40.384
[Robert] We needed a good lawyer
to help us get there.

01:09:40.467 --> 01:09:41.302
[phone ringing]

01:09:41.385 --> 01:09:43.804
The main thing we had Eric Pope work on

01:09:43.888 --> 01:09:46.974
was making sure
that Centracoins weren't securities.

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:51.270
Because we didn't want to be
in hot water with the SEC.

01:09:56.066 --> 01:09:57.735
Our secretary got the mail,

01:09:57.818 --> 01:10:01.447
and there was
a 500-page subpoena from the SEC.

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:04.700
We're a company that wants to comply, um,

01:10:04.783 --> 01:10:08.037
with the laws and regulations
here in the United States.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:11.165
That's when we hired
in-house counsel, Allan Shutt.

01:10:11.248 --> 01:10:13.709
General Counsel and
Chief Compliance Officer at Centra Tech.

01:10:13.792 --> 01:10:18.214
Allan Shutt started asking questions
about who our legal counsel was.

01:10:18.297 --> 01:10:20.466
And we told him, "Hey, listen,
it's this guy Eric Pope

01:10:20.549 --> 01:10:22.218
from Water Street in Manhattan."

01:10:22.301 --> 01:10:25.763
[Ray] "Who has, like, 20 years
of business experience as a lawyer."

01:10:25.846 --> 01:10:29.516
[Robert] "His website's beautiful.
He's quick on the phone. He's perfect."

01:10:30.267 --> 01:10:31.143
Uh…

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:33.812
And he said,
"Okay, I can't find his bar license."

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.107
"What do you mean?"

01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:38.400
Um…

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:41.695
And he said, "This guy's a fraudster."
"What are you talking about?"

01:10:42.696 --> 01:10:43.864
"It's a scam."

01:10:44.365 --> 01:10:49.411
Eric Pope ended up being
a college kid from Virginia…

01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:51.413
-Hey, are you going to the party later?
-[exhales]

01:10:51.997 --> 01:10:53.582
-Uh… No.
-Okay.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.834
[Robert] …named John Lambert.

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:58.504
[gun firing in video game]

01:10:59.672 --> 01:11:03.634
I see Donald Trump
as reviving the Republican Party.

01:11:04.593 --> 01:11:07.388
[Robert] And he was one of the founders
of Students for Trump.

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:11.141
[Ray] He was in college.
You know, we… we paid him.

01:11:12.142 --> 01:11:14.937
And so we got finessed
by this young college kid

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:18.774
into believing
we were abiding by the SEC's rules.

01:11:18.857 --> 01:11:20.067
[phone ringing]

01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:23.654
Just take it off your website and abide by
the cease-and-desist, no problem.

01:11:24.363 --> 01:11:25.614
You're a utility token.

01:11:26.198 --> 01:11:29.743
Most companies start with a vision,
and they build it into a reality.

01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:32.746
[Robert] All the emails he sent us
with the SEC were fake.

01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:35.582
Everything was… was a lie.

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:37.543
It was, like, this young kid… [laughs]

01:11:37.626 --> 01:11:38.460
Fucking maniac.

01:11:38.544 --> 01:11:42.298
My partner thought it was a legit lawyer
the whole time he was talking to him,

01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:45.884
and he basically scammed a company
that was already scamming.

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:47.428
-It was--
-[man] Double scamming.

01:11:47.511 --> 01:11:50.306
-He was scamming the scammer, huh?
-Yeah, crazy.

01:11:54.101 --> 01:11:56.854
[Cohen] The SEC will build
the foundation of the case,

01:11:56.937 --> 01:12:00.983
and then the FBI and Department of Justice
sort of takes that foundation,

01:12:01.066 --> 01:12:02.943
and then they go forward
on the criminal side.

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:07.156
[man] I read Nathaniel Popper's
New York Times article,

01:12:07.239 --> 01:12:11.118
where there's a photo
of the three co-founders of Centra Tech.

01:12:11.201 --> 01:12:14.455
And they're in these snazzy suits,
and they look very happy.

01:12:14.538 --> 01:12:18.208
It's like giving a middle finger
to the FBI and saying, "Come get me."

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:23.005
There was rampant fraud
going on in this market.

01:12:23.088 --> 01:12:24.840
Way, way too many cases.

01:12:24.923 --> 01:12:29.386
We were just looking for what are
the most egregious examples of conduct,

01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:31.889
where we need to send a…
a message to the market.

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:35.351
When you're sitting there as a prosecutor,
your first thought is,

01:12:35.434 --> 01:12:37.311
"Maybe there's an explanation
for some of this."

01:12:37.394 --> 01:12:38.896
"Maybe they did have a license."

01:12:38.979 --> 01:12:41.231
"Maybe Mike Edwards is a real person."

01:12:41.815 --> 01:12:43.734
[anchor] Basically,
he got compensation to promote

01:12:43.817 --> 01:12:46.528
this initial coin offering
and didn't disclose it.

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:50.949
[Cohen] The SEC filed complaints
against DJ Khaled and Floyd Mayweather.

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:54.244
They had to give back the money
they'd been paid for these promotions.

01:12:54.328 --> 01:12:55.871
They also paid penalties.

01:12:56.497 --> 01:13:01.210
After that, Centra started taking actions
to try and hide things right away.

01:13:01.293 --> 01:13:02.961
Money started going out of accounts.

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:05.923
And that really accelerated
everything coming apart.

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:09.760
-[interviewer] Were you nervous, man?
-Nah, nothing really fazed me at all.

01:13:09.843 --> 01:13:12.679
I had so many--
Xanax makes you not really feel anything.

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:18.102
[Jacob] One day, I got messaged.

01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:22.815
"Hey, do you know of Centra Tech?
We're gonna file a lawsuit."

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:27.736
I ended up contacting them and saying,
"Hey, listen, I collected all this data."

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:30.739
And I… I presented all the information.

01:13:30.823 --> 01:13:32.658
And they said,
"Hey, you're the right guy."

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:35.119
"Would you represent
this class action lawsuit?"

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:38.622
I did accept the role
of becoming the lead plaintiff.

01:13:38.705 --> 01:13:40.999
[dramatic music playing]

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:44.086
The SEC would eventually
use our information

01:13:44.169 --> 01:13:47.214
from our lawsuit to take down Centra Tech.

01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:50.342
[Cohen] The SEC worked together
with the Department of Justice

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:53.762
to put together a case so that the FBI
could go arrest these guys.

01:13:54.763 --> 01:13:58.767
This was the first big,
high-profile fraud case

01:13:58.851 --> 01:14:01.228
that the SEC brought
in the cryptocurrency world.

01:14:03.772 --> 01:14:06.275
[Ray] When the SEC investigation
was going on…

01:14:07.901 --> 01:14:12.573
me and Sorbee were fighting over debt
that we had made from Miami Exotics.

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:15.534
I go to Sorbee, and I'm like,

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:18.036
"Yo, we have to take, you know,
half a million dollars,

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:20.330
pay off all this debt
that I had sitting there."

01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:23.709
I just wanted to pay that all off
because it was all in my family's name.

01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:27.379
Let's take, you know $500,000 in Ethereum.
I'll cash it out,

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:30.549
pay all my family's debt
that we had built together.

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:31.467
Only fair.

01:14:32.342 --> 01:14:34.052
I wanted it to come from Centra.

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:35.846
He says, "Yo, go fuck yourself."

01:14:35.929 --> 01:14:38.891
I almost got in a fistfight
with him, like, in the office.

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:42.936
If Sorbee had paid that debt,
I swear I would have never fucked him.

01:14:44.188 --> 01:14:46.982
I stepped down from the company.
I was like, "Fuck you."

01:14:48.525 --> 01:14:52.196
I just started cashing out
millions of dollars in Centracoin myself.

01:14:52.696 --> 01:14:56.200
I mean, it was bad.
You know, everything was crazy.

01:14:56.742 --> 01:15:01.580
Bill, Pop, knew nothing about everything
that was going on, how bad it was.

01:15:03.081 --> 01:15:05.417
[Kerri] He was very sick.
He was having chemotherapy.

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:06.752
He had brain surgery.

01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:09.379
[music ends]

01:15:10.047 --> 01:15:11.798
My father died in the middle of it.

01:15:14.092 --> 01:15:16.094
[somber music playing]

01:15:17.429 --> 01:15:19.139
[young Ray] Whoa, we're high.

01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:21.558
Oh, that's awesome. Look at that.

01:15:21.642 --> 01:15:22.476
[Pop] You like this?

01:15:22.559 --> 01:15:23.810
[Kerri] He totally loved Ray.

01:15:24.478 --> 01:15:26.355
You know, and he loved my father.

01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:29.149
-[Pop] Say hello to Pop. Look at me.
-[Ray] Hello.

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:31.527
[Pop] Say, "Hello, Poparoo."

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:38.116
Ray was devastated.

01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:41.537
[Ray] I'm going off on a bender.

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:44.122
[Kerri] He was in, like,
the height of addiction.

01:15:44.831 --> 01:15:46.833
Yeah, I mean, it-- I was fearful.

01:15:49.086 --> 01:15:51.630
Taking Xanax like they were M&M's.

01:15:56.843 --> 01:15:58.845
At that point, I was like,
"Fuck this company."

01:15:58.929 --> 01:16:01.473
I'm gambling every day,
doing drugs every day.

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.225
And, you know, why work?

01:16:03.308 --> 01:16:06.186
I don't have any more responsibility,
and I have all this money.

01:16:09.064 --> 01:16:11.984
I'm playing a high-stakes poker game,
and Sorbee calls me.

01:16:12.776 --> 01:16:14.111
[tense music playing]

01:16:18.365 --> 01:16:20.325
And he tells me
he got arrested for security fraud.

01:16:27.791 --> 01:16:29.793
You know,
I'm like, "I'm fucked," of course,

01:16:29.876 --> 01:16:32.337
but, you know, I… I try to think positive.

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:36.258
I'm pretty good at compartmentalizing
and thinking positive in any given moment.

01:16:36.341 --> 01:16:37.926
Before I left the casino that day,

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:40.846
I just took as many drugs
as possible to kind of make sure

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:44.516
if I'm getting arrested,
I'm gonna be high when I get arrested.

01:16:45.017 --> 01:16:47.102
[sirens wailing]

01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:49.771
[brakes screeching]

01:16:57.487 --> 01:16:59.406
[Kerri] His attorney called me,

01:16:59.489 --> 01:17:01.533
and she said, "You know, I have bad news."

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:04.411
"He's facing like 240 years
in federal prison."

01:17:05.370 --> 01:17:08.457
Man, this is some scary stuff, you know?

01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:10.584
I was terrified for him.

01:17:11.668 --> 01:17:13.045
I didn't wanna lose my son.

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:18.091
Centra are accused of masterminding
a fraudulent initial coin offering,

01:17:18.175 --> 01:17:22.512
that Centra offered a debit card it said
was backed by Visa and MasterCard.

01:17:22.596 --> 01:17:26.016
But the SEC says that Centra
had no relationship with either company.

01:17:26.683 --> 01:17:30.646
[Jacob] It felt good to know that justice
was gonna get served in some capacity.

01:17:30.729 --> 01:17:33.523
[interviewer] Did you feel like
you had played a part in that?

01:17:34.024 --> 01:17:37.611
Absolutely. SEC, Homeland Security,
they were using our case.

01:17:38.111 --> 01:17:42.324
I was charged with security fraud,
conspiracy to commit security fraud,

01:17:42.407 --> 01:17:45.327
wire fraud,
and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.

01:17:46.244 --> 01:17:48.997
And at that point,
I start, like, reaching out to my lawyers,

01:17:49.081 --> 01:17:51.083
and I'm like, "What's going on here?"

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:54.711
They were like, "Well, what you can do
is you can cooperate if you want."

01:17:54.795 --> 01:17:59.174
I tell my lawyer, I'm like, "I would 100%
cooperate, no problem, whatever it takes."

01:17:59.257 --> 01:18:02.552
And I met with them to try to cooperate,
and they were like,

01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:05.472
"You're… You can't even speak
you're on so many drugs."

01:18:05.555 --> 01:18:08.475
"Like, how you gonna cooperate?"
And they sent me to rehab.

01:18:19.486 --> 01:18:20.904
I've been to rehab 13 times.

01:18:21.571 --> 01:18:24.991
But this time, you know, I was just like,
"You know what? Fuck it. I'm done."

01:18:30.497 --> 01:18:33.709
Today is my sentencing for 11 felonies.

01:18:35.502 --> 01:18:36.920
Facing over 100 years.

01:18:39.005 --> 01:18:42.718
The biggest thing is to have the judge
believe you're not gonna do more crime.

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:46.221
The whole point of putting
someone in jail is to make it

01:18:46.304 --> 01:18:49.141
so they don't commit more crimes
and hurt the, uh, the community,

01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:50.392
or whatever the fuck they say.

01:18:50.976 --> 01:18:53.270
[lawyer] So how is the baby?

01:18:53.353 --> 01:18:55.605
[Ray] My wife is actually
in the hospital. [chuckles]

01:18:56.189 --> 01:18:59.359
-[lawyer] No way, dude.
-Yeah, her water broke this morning.

01:18:59.443 --> 01:19:01.611
-[lawyer] Oh my God.
-Yeah, I took her to the hospital.

01:19:01.695 --> 01:19:03.530
[lawyer] Do you want to go
to the hospital?

01:19:03.613 --> 01:19:05.949
-[Ray] I'm gonna go after.
-[lawyer] Is she going to make it?

01:19:06.032 --> 01:19:07.242
Yeah, I mean, her water broke.

01:19:07.325 --> 01:19:10.412
She thinks she's gonna be there all day,
but she doesn't want me… Like…

01:19:10.495 --> 01:19:13.415
No one wants me to delay this court date.
She doesn't want me to.

01:19:13.498 --> 01:19:15.500
[intriguing music playing]

01:19:18.962 --> 01:19:20.422
Do I look like a criminal?

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:24.968
I met my wife
while I had an ankle bracelet on.

01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:30.223
I felt like she was the one,
and I… I ran with it.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.560
Like, within a month, she was pregnant.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:35.854
It wasn't a planned thing.

01:19:35.937 --> 01:19:38.482
Obviously, like, you know,
you're finishing in her,

01:19:38.565 --> 01:19:41.735
so it's like, you know, you kind of know
that there's a possibility.

01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:44.696
I got sober.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.782
I cooperated with law enforcement.

01:19:46.865 --> 01:19:50.118
I cooperated with the FBI, the SEC.
I gave them everything I know.

01:19:51.745 --> 01:19:53.830
If you work with the FBI,
they work with you,

01:19:53.914 --> 01:19:58.043
and… and you kind of, you know…
It just requires complete honesty.

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:01.421
I gave the FBI enough information

01:20:01.505 --> 01:20:05.133
to be able to put Sorbee away
for eight years and Farkas away.

01:20:05.217 --> 01:20:07.219
[somber music playing]

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:23.318
So this is the room
where Sam got sentenced…

01:20:26.404 --> 01:20:27.489
on Zoom.

01:20:27.572 --> 01:20:29.241
Sam was sitting right there.

01:20:29.908 --> 01:20:32.577
His mother, his father, my whole family.

01:20:33.537 --> 01:20:34.704
Eight years is…

01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:37.833
It's fucked up.

01:20:39.292 --> 01:20:40.335
[exhales]

01:20:41.461 --> 01:20:43.171
[man] I think it was really drastic.

01:20:44.047 --> 01:20:47.008
I don't agree with the sentencing
across the board in this case.

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:50.303
Farkas just didn't strike me as the type.

01:20:51.388 --> 01:20:54.015
He was just sort of
a deer in the headlights.

01:20:54.099 --> 01:20:57.310
I think his biggest mistake
was getting involved

01:20:57.394 --> 01:21:00.272
and… and relying on…
on what he was being told.

01:21:01.273 --> 01:21:02.399
But Ray Trapani…

01:21:03.817 --> 01:21:05.527
Ray Trapani's a real criminal.

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:14.911
[Ray] The fact that I cooperated
means a lot.

01:21:14.995 --> 01:21:17.789
So, you know,
I'm in hopes that I get less time.

01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:20.834
[hopeful music playing]

01:21:21.668 --> 01:21:24.337
You know, I am sorry for what I did.

01:21:26.006 --> 01:21:28.466
It's always been very hard to find empathy

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:31.303
and these feelings towards people
that I've never really met.

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:32.929
I've always been like that.

01:21:33.763 --> 01:21:37.225
I think that's something that I need
to build on myself and really get there,

01:21:37.309 --> 01:21:41.354
where it's like I can feel for, you know,
Joe Schmo that's in China.

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:45.734
[music continues]

01:21:47.652 --> 01:21:50.405
[woman] Mister Trapani,
I'm very much influenced

01:21:50.488 --> 01:21:53.199
by the government's report
of your cooperation.

01:21:53.283 --> 01:21:55.911
I'm not sure I've ever heard
the word "extraordinary"

01:21:55.994 --> 01:22:00.624
used in connection with cooperation,
and now I've heard it multiple times

01:22:00.707 --> 01:22:02.959
at every stage of the case,

01:22:03.043 --> 01:22:07.130
from the investigation
to sentencing of your co-defendants.

01:22:07.964 --> 01:22:12.010
So, Mister Trapani,
it is the judgment of the court

01:22:12.093 --> 01:22:17.057
that you are sentenced
to a term of imprisonment of time served.

01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:19.893
I really didn't want
to interrupt the path that you are on,

01:22:19.976 --> 01:22:22.395
because you seem to be doing so well.

01:22:22.479 --> 01:22:24.272
[suspenseful music playing]

01:22:24.356 --> 01:22:26.358
[inaudible]

01:22:28.485 --> 01:22:30.654
-We did it. No jail time.
-[wife on phone]Yeah.

01:22:30.737 --> 01:22:32.489
I love you so much. I'm so happy.

01:22:32.572 --> 01:22:33.531
[Ray] I love you.

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:35.784
I'm coming now.
I'm coming straight to you then.

01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:38.995
Yeah, hold out.
An hour and a half, I'll be there.

01:22:39.079 --> 01:22:40.330
[laughs]

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:44.250
[laughing]

01:22:46.169 --> 01:22:48.296
It's shocking to me, with his record

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:51.967
and as much of a scumbag
as he admits he is,

01:22:52.592 --> 01:22:57.097
that he winds up with literally
the lowest sentence in this case.

01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:58.014
Why?

01:22:58.723 --> 01:23:01.101
Well, because he cooperated
with the government.

01:23:01.184 --> 01:23:02.644
All of a sudden,

01:23:02.727 --> 01:23:07.691
it puts an aura on somebody that somehow
justifies treating them differently.

01:23:09.901 --> 01:23:11.820
[Ray] No time, bitch. [laughs]

01:23:11.903 --> 01:23:12.988
[Kerri] Well, she loved you.

01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:15.573
[lawyer] Comparing it to Sorbee's
is like night and day.

01:23:16.074 --> 01:23:18.201
He's facing 175 years.

01:23:18.284 --> 01:23:21.287
[Petrruzzi] With cooperators, when you
completely absolve them of everything,

01:23:21.371 --> 01:23:23.999
and you reduce a sentence
from 20 years to zero,

01:23:24.082 --> 01:23:25.834
are you sending any message at all?

01:23:25.917 --> 01:23:27.127
You shouldn't commit crimes,

01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:29.796
or just the next time
that you carjack somebody,

01:23:29.879 --> 01:23:33.967
rat out the person that you did it with,
and you can go home.

01:23:34.050 --> 01:23:35.719
He's a criminal through and through.

01:23:36.219 --> 01:23:38.221
I can almost guarantee

01:23:38.304 --> 01:23:41.891
that of the three people
that were prosecuted in this case,

01:23:41.975 --> 01:23:45.770
the one most likely to wind up
in federal court again is Ray Trapani.

01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:48.314
And it's not civil court either.
It'll be criminal.

01:23:50.608 --> 01:23:52.861
[phone ringing]

01:23:53.903 --> 01:23:56.197
Yeah. Oh my God.

01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:57.407
-[lawyer] Oh.
-[Kerri] Aw.

01:23:57.490 --> 01:23:58.450
[laughing]

01:24:00.076 --> 01:24:02.162
Hey, babe. [laughs]

01:24:02.245 --> 01:24:04.706
-How's he doing, babe?
-Where are you?

01:24:04.789 --> 01:24:08.334
I'm, uh, about 20 minutes
to 30 minutes out.

01:24:08.418 --> 01:24:09.753
All right, I'll be there soon.

01:24:10.378 --> 01:24:11.296
-Okay.
-[Ray] Goodbye.

01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:12.547
[Kerri] Aw.

01:24:13.548 --> 01:24:14.466
Ouch.

01:24:14.549 --> 01:24:16.551
[joyful music playing]

01:24:21.639 --> 01:24:24.350
-[lawyer] Jeez, what a day, right?
-[Kerri chuckling]

01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:30.899
[all laugh]

01:24:32.275 --> 01:24:33.693
He wasn't even crying.

01:24:33.777 --> 01:24:35.361
[joyful music continues]

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:46.539
[Liam crying]

01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:54.547
[Robert] He's a degenerate.

01:24:55.298 --> 01:24:58.218
The audacity of the government
to praise him as a good guy.

01:25:03.473 --> 01:25:07.268
[interviewer] Ray Trapani just received
his sentencing last month.

01:25:07.352 --> 01:25:09.145
-Oh?
-[interviewer] He got no time.

01:25:09.646 --> 01:25:11.106
-Time… Time served.
-Really?

01:25:11.689 --> 01:25:12.524
Wow.

01:25:14.901 --> 01:25:16.653
-Wow, that's incredible.
-[interviewer] Yeah.

01:25:17.153 --> 01:25:17.987
Yeah.

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:19.906
That upsets me.

01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:21.533
That upsets me.

01:25:22.617 --> 01:25:24.953
-Can I walk now? I'm gonna--
-[interviewer] Okay, yeah.

01:25:27.205 --> 01:25:28.373
[Jacob] Oh!

01:25:33.586 --> 01:25:34.504
[door opens]

01:25:37.257 --> 01:25:38.341
Oh man.

01:25:38.424 --> 01:25:40.218
[interviewer]
Do you think he's really changed?

01:25:40.301 --> 01:25:43.555
I hope so, but that doesn't absolve him
from what he's done in his past.

01:25:43.638 --> 01:25:45.056
That, you know, um…

01:25:46.266 --> 01:25:48.143
And likely-- And likely

01:25:48.768 --> 01:25:52.105
there might be more funds out there
that he still has from other people.

01:25:52.605 --> 01:25:54.399
You know? Um…

01:25:54.941 --> 01:25:56.734
[interviewer]
What happened with your money?

01:25:59.571 --> 01:26:02.198
-We gotta stop that one.
-[interviewer] Yeah.

01:26:02.282 --> 01:26:05.160
Now, Sorbee supposedly ha--
You know, before he got arrested,

01:26:05.243 --> 01:26:07.745
they were saying
that he has a whole new fleet of cars.

01:26:08.371 --> 01:26:11.416
I told the FBI that there's
more money out there, you know.

01:26:11.499 --> 01:26:13.126
It's up to them to find it.

01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:16.087
[somber music playing]

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:26.764
-[interviewer] You're buying a house?
-[Ray] Yeah.

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:28.558
-[interviewer] How are you buying a house?
-[Ray] Money.

01:26:28.641 --> 01:26:30.560
-That's usually how it goes.
-[interviewer] Yeah.

01:26:30.643 --> 01:26:33.313
How do you have money to pay for
the house? How's he buying a house?

01:26:33.396 --> 01:26:36.065
Ray? Ask him. I don't know.

01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:38.151
[interviewer] How did Ray buy a house?

01:26:38.234 --> 01:26:39.194
Ray bought a house--

01:26:39.277 --> 01:26:43.489
His… His, um, father-in-law co-signed
with his wife, yeah.

01:26:43.573 --> 01:26:46.826
I don't know any single person
sub-40 buying a house.

01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:51.289
They're all just-- They get a "good job,"
and they're just working, fucking,

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:53.333
and living in an apartment
for their whole life.

01:26:54.125 --> 01:26:56.711
[interviewer] You never know.
Like, all of a sudden there's a house.

01:26:56.794 --> 01:26:58.713
Why are you telling me that now? Because--

01:26:58.796 --> 01:27:00.798
[interviewer] I'm just--
I'm just curious, like--

01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:05.261
There's no locked, uh, millions of dollars
in crypto hidden anywhere?

01:27:05.887 --> 01:27:08.181
I wish there was
because I would cash it all out,

01:27:08.264 --> 01:27:11.142
and I would move somewhere
away from this crazy country.

01:27:12.477 --> 01:27:13.311
[laughs]

01:27:13.811 --> 01:27:14.646
Really.

01:27:14.729 --> 01:27:17.857
[Ray] Like, our parents, they were able
to buy a house for like 20 grand,

01:27:17.941 --> 01:27:20.735
keep it forever, and now they're
millionaires. It's fucking ridiculous.

01:27:20.818 --> 01:27:22.445
[Kerri] I said it from the very beginning.

01:27:22.528 --> 01:27:25.114
If you make him look like a scumbag,
I'm really gonna be pissed.

01:27:25.198 --> 01:27:27.784
Because I… I swear to God,
you'll be in big trouble.

01:27:29.035 --> 01:27:29.869
I'm not kidding.

01:27:29.953 --> 01:27:31.412
[interviewer] How do people trust

01:27:31.496 --> 01:27:33.665
that Ray doesn't have money
or Sorbee doesn't have money?

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:35.166
[Kerri] Sorbee definitely has money.

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:37.585
You're gonna tell me
that when all this money was made

01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:39.379
that he didn't hide it somewhere?

01:27:39.462 --> 01:27:41.422
And that he knows
when he gets out in eight years

01:27:41.506 --> 01:27:43.299
that he's gonna be perfectly fine?

01:27:43.383 --> 01:27:45.885
Why do you think
his girlfriend's staying with him?

01:27:45.969 --> 01:27:48.012
You think that there's…
there's nothing there?

01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:49.889
She just loves him so much?

01:27:50.515 --> 01:27:54.018
I'm not saying she doesn't love him.
I don't know if she loves him or not.

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:57.397
There's no way that Sorbee
does not have money put somewhere.

01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:58.439
[laughs]

01:27:58.523 --> 01:28:00.441
[interviewer]
You say the only way to buy a house

01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:02.568
is to do something shady
or to get help from someone--

01:28:02.652 --> 01:28:04.320
-Yeah.
-[interviewer] You're buying a house.

01:28:04.404 --> 01:28:05.530
Which one did you do?

01:28:05.613 --> 01:28:07.657
I did something shady, clearly.

01:28:08.157 --> 01:28:10.368
My fucking whole story is shady shit.
