00:51.801 --> 00:54.929
Throw it here.
- Come on, Nelson, throw it in here!

00:55.138 --> 00:57.766
Yeah! You almost had it!
- I get one more?

00:57.974 --> 00:59.601
Strike three!

01:14.407 --> 01:17.994
Here you go. There it is.
- Gretchen, you almost had it.

01:28.046 --> 01:30.131
Dang it.
- Nice throw.

01:30.715 --> 01:31.925
l got a ladder. l'll get it.

01:32.133 --> 01:36.137
Just tell Mrs. Donnelly it's on the roof.
She can get it whenever she wants.

01:36.346 --> 01:37.555
That's good thinking, Clark.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.975
l'll just have 80- year- old
Mrs. Donnelly climb on her roof.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.478
Okay, cool. Thanks.

01:44.521 --> 01:45.689
Clark. Hey.

01:45.897 --> 01:47.857
l was kidding. You can't do that.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.234
All right, fine.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.486
Here, give her one of these.

01:52.570 --> 01:55.865
This is yesterday's paper.
- Well, at least it's not on the roof.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.535
Clark, don't pick your nose
in front of me, please.

01:58.743 --> 02:00.704
l'm not picking, l'm scratching.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.372
What are you scratching,
your brain?

02:02.539 --> 02:04.666
Yeah, because it's huge.

02:07.210 --> 02:10.839
Chain break! Not now!
l have 86 houses left.

02:11.047 --> 02:12.632
Can you fix it?

02:14.217 --> 02:16.886
Gus, what should I do with this?
- l'd flick it.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.561
Nelson leans in and gets his sign.

02:24.769 --> 02:26.855
Here comes a fastball.

02:27.689 --> 02:31.151
Swing and a huge miss
by Gretchen Peterson.

02:31.401 --> 02:35.238
Hey, losers. We have a practice
scheduled here. You gotta go.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.615
I thought your practice was at 4:30.
- lt is.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.909
We wanna have a practice
before our practice.

02:40.118 --> 02:43.580
Oh, okay. Can we hit with you?
- No, you suck.

02:43.997 --> 02:47.042
Why don't you go home
and build your science projects.

02:48.585 --> 02:52.464
Look, there's room for all of us.
We'll just play catch off to the side.

02:52.672 --> 02:55.091
Listen, we have a game tomorrow...

02:55.258 --> 02:57.260
...and there's only one field
to practice on.

02:57.469 --> 02:59.054
So beat it!

03:01.598 --> 03:03.433
Maybe this is a sign
you should get a car.

03:03.641 --> 03:06.686
My mother said I should hold off
getting my license one more year.

03:06.936 --> 03:11.066
You know, just to make sure
my reflexes are fully developed.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.275
Stop!
- Hold him, Kyle!

03:12.484 --> 03:15.111
Troy, I think he wants
some of your famous beef stew.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.571
"Beef stew! Beef stew!"
- Stop!

03:17.197 --> 03:19.908
{y:i}Beef stew! Beef stew! Beef stew!

03:20.116 --> 03:21.618
No, no, no.

03:22.952 --> 03:24.746
No, stop it.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.628
Hey! Get off him!

03:31.795 --> 03:33.296
Later, fart face.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.256
Yeah, you better run!

03:41.805 --> 03:44.307
Are you all right?
- Yeah, l'm fine.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.476
Need us to call your parents
or something?

03:46.976 --> 03:48.603
lt actually...

03:48.812 --> 03:51.815
...didn't taste as bad as you'd think.

03:54.901 --> 03:58.113
Nelson, wait!
Let's just go to my house!

03:58.321 --> 04:00.824
Oh, I love beef stew.

04:00.991 --> 04:03.868
Why do kids have to be
so fricking cruel?

04:10.625 --> 04:14.629
You know, I haven't been on
an actual field in almost 20 years.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.296
l've never even been on a field.

04:16.880 --> 04:20.510
lf I tried, the kids in my neighborhood
would spit loogies on my forehead.

04:20.718 --> 04:22.345
That's awful, Clark.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.514
Baseball is America's pastime.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.807
That's like saying
you've never had apple pie.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.020
You've never had apple pie?

04:30.186 --> 04:32.647
Well, my mom said
it would give me diarrhea.

04:32.856 --> 04:35.483
That's ridiculous.
You have to try it at least once.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.484
Diarrhea?

04:37.694 --> 04:40.488
No. Baseball. lt's the best.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.906
Let's come back here later
and hit some balls.

04:43.867 --> 04:46.328
Can I bring Richie?
He's never played either.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.705
Yeah, bring Richie. Let's say 4:00.
- All right.

04:50.664 --> 04:53.417
Hold on. My mom's sending me
a text message.

04:54.835 --> 04:56.003
No way!

04:56.212 --> 04:59.549
We're having macaroni tonight!
That means garlic bread! Yes!

04:59.757 --> 05:01.134
Awesome!

05:04.803 --> 05:06.847
Excuse me.
- Yeah?

05:07.057 --> 05:08.683
l rented this
on your recommendation.

05:08.891 --> 05:11.602
lt's nothing but a lame story
with lesbian sex scenes.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.229
And you didn't like it?

05:13.437 --> 05:15.773
l watched it with my parents.
lt was uncomfortable.

05:15.981 --> 05:18.401
Come on, it's kind of hot.
- No, it's not.

05:18.609 --> 05:20.235
All right, l'm sorry.

05:20.903 --> 05:23.406
l'll recommend this:
{y:i}Haunted Slumber Party.

05:23.614 --> 05:26.868
lt's actually a pretty decent film.
- No lesbian sex scenes?

05:27.076 --> 05:29.661
I think there's two.
- You're a pig.

05:31.080 --> 05:35.209
Hey, Richie, are you off yet?
- Easy. I can't leave this second, Clark.

05:35.417 --> 05:38.213
l don't get to work for an hour a day
like you, paperboy.

05:38.420 --> 05:40.381
Gus wants us to
hit some baseballs with him.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.425
Clark, we don't play baseball.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.886
l told Gus we'd be there, Richie.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.390
And if we don't go,
that makes me a liar.

05:48.597 --> 05:52.309
And that's not what l'm about.
Not now, not ever.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.687
All right, Daytime Emmy.

05:54.895 --> 05:57.065
Hey, Marty, l'm gonna split early,
all right?

05:57.273 --> 05:59.734
l don't even know who you are.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.611
Bros before ho's, dude.

06:06.324 --> 06:09.076
Liz, honey, do you know
where I packed my baseball mitt?

06:09.285 --> 06:13.580
No. Gus, if we conceive this month,
we would have the baby in January.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.625
lt would be fun to have
a New Year's baby.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.209
l can't find it.

06:17.419 --> 06:20.421
January also has a higher
percentage of it being a girl.

06:21.463 --> 06:24.259
l found it. I found it.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.845
l found my mitt, Liz.
lt was in the old trunk.

06:27.053 --> 06:30.597
Be serious. This is important.
My ovulation peaks at 6:00 tonight.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.101
All right, honey, I love you.
l'll see you later.

06:33.308 --> 06:35.186
Remember, Gus, 6:00.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.816
Gotta keep your eye on the ball.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.777
You just think of that?
You're an amazing coach.

06:44.153 --> 06:47.449
Just focus, you'll be fine.
Just watch me.

06:47.657 --> 06:50.743
With this vest, it's hard to swing.
lt's tight, you know.

06:51.493 --> 06:55.372
Quit picking your nose, Clark.
Let's go. Look alive. Coming to you!

07:04.716 --> 07:07.010
You just lost your membership
at Video Spot!

07:07.468 --> 07:08.635
Dang it.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.971
Hey, mister,
we have this field reserved.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.475
You were the ones
picking on that kid today.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.226
So? You douche bags
have to get off this field.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.355
Where's your coach?
- None of your business.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.483
We have practice here,
so go, ho!

07:21.858 --> 07:24.027
Hey, well, no coach, no field. Sorry.

07:24.234 --> 07:26.696
Leave our field,
or you'll pay the consequences!

07:27.071 --> 07:28.614
What is this, "Children of the Corn"?

07:29.532 --> 07:30.742
l'm gonna call the cops.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.578
We are cops. We're Navy SEAIs.

07:33.786 --> 07:36.205
Navy SEAIs aren't cops.
- Aren't you our paperboy?

07:37.373 --> 07:38.791
l'm undercover.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.670
All right, you cocky jerks, you want
the field so bad? We'll play you for it.

07:42.878 --> 07:45.881
But there are nine of us
and three of you.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.592
So you should beat us no problem.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.552
What, are you scared?
- No.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.428
Yeah, chicken.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.682
l'm gonna go ask our team.

07:54.890 --> 07:56.558
This is a bad idea. They look tough.

07:56.893 --> 08:00.562
l saw that demon boy laying beef
in some nice kid's mouth earlier today.

08:01.230 --> 08:04.024
Clark used to get beef
laid in his face all the time.

08:04.234 --> 08:07.946
Oh, and you didn't?
- I got wedgies, that's different.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.031
lt's cooler.

08:10.239 --> 08:12.783
We'll do it.
- Time to meet your makers.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.369
Makers of what? Poop?

08:18.247 --> 08:19.415
Coming down!

08:21.041 --> 08:23.670
Balls in.
- Don't worry, you'll be fine.

08:23.877 --> 08:26.548
Get your position down.
- Troy, strike this loser out.

08:31.593 --> 08:33.221
Strike!
- Yeah. Nice one, Troy.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.265
Don't swing if it's not
in the strike zone.

08:35.472 --> 08:37.765
Where's the strike zone?
- Strike two!

08:37.976 --> 08:38.933
Right there.

08:42.479 --> 08:44.398
Strike three.
- Three, you're out!

08:46.109 --> 08:48.570
What a loser.
- Sit down, spaz.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.489
That kid's throwing heat.
- Heat, schmeat.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.115
One out!

08:53.282 --> 08:54.783
Gonna be two outs!

08:54.950 --> 08:58.495
Hey, I bet you're a real good catcher.
Of doughnuts, in your mouth.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.666
Strike!
- Don't chop at it.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.794
it's not a sword.
- You're not a sword.

09:05.627 --> 09:07.421
Come on.
- Strike two.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.424
Oh, that's ugly, man.
- Strike out, video boy.

09:10.632 --> 09:11.718
Come on, now.

09:14.971 --> 09:17.640
Strike three!
- I caught it. You're out.

09:18.015 --> 09:20.643
But I ticked it. lt hit the bat.
- You're still out.

09:20.851 --> 09:23.687
You're still fat. I ticked it!

09:23.896 --> 09:26.940
I ticked it. Gus, you see that?
- Way to make contact on that one.

09:27.150 --> 09:30.653
You know what? I was trying
to get under it to rip it into left...

09:30.861 --> 09:33.531
...and throw them off,
but the dog barking threw me.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.658
What dog?
- He ran to the bushes.

09:35.825 --> 09:39.119
lt's cool now. All right, go, Gus.
Come on! Let's get rid of these dogs.

09:39.328 --> 09:41.122
Strike him out quick!
- Get this guy out!

09:41.330 --> 09:44.375
Move in.
- You're going down, shorty.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.877
Guy's got nothing.
- Come on, give him a fast one.

09:51.507 --> 09:53.468
All right, Gus! Awesome!

09:54.760 --> 09:57.054
All right! Yeah!

10:00.015 --> 10:02.643
He just did that steroid- free.
- What's steroids?

10:02.851 --> 10:05.312
Something that makes
your pee- pee smaller.

10:05.521 --> 10:09.401
There must be steroids in macaroni.
- Let's go.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.653
Yeah!

10:12.070 --> 10:13.153
Nice!

10:21.078 --> 10:22.664
Here we go.
- Batter up.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.039
Batter up!

10:32.799 --> 10:34.216
Strike!

10:35.051 --> 10:36.343
Not so fast!

10:36.552 --> 10:39.054
You're supposed to catch it
with your glove, not your face.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.515
Yeah!

10:40.723 --> 10:42.851
l don't need lip from you,
son of Satan.

10:43.059 --> 10:46.062
We're still in this thing.
- lt's okay. Next time.

10:47.896 --> 10:49.273
You're out!

10:50.107 --> 10:51.567
You're out!

10:52.568 --> 10:53.695
Strike three, you're out!

10:53.903 --> 10:57.072
Come on, Troy. Let's go, Troy.
- He can't hit you. Come on.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.119
Yes!
- Yeah, Gus! Are you okay?

11:08.625 --> 11:09.960
lt's over!

11:11.254 --> 11:12.713
Three, you're out!

11:13.590 --> 11:16.508
Sorry. Shoot.
Get another homer for us, Gus.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.969
Yeah, smack it in the butt.
- Whatever that means.

11:19.638 --> 11:23.892
l'm gonna keep this one in play.
Give the infield a workout. lt's 17-0.

11:24.099 --> 11:27.228
What an idiot.
Come on, Troy, destroy him!

11:27.604 --> 11:29.314
Strike him out. Strike this loser- -

11:31.482 --> 11:32.942
Come on, Kyle, are you okay?

11:33.151 --> 11:35.278
What happened?
- Get up.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.072
Hey, get him up.
- Kyle, you okay?

11:38.489 --> 11:42.077
Ball's still alive, chumps.
- Dude, he's gonna score.

11:43.619 --> 11:45.080
Should somebody call 41 1 ?

11:45.288 --> 11:47.331
He's fine.
He got the wind knocked out of him.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.250
What's that noise?

11:54.130 --> 11:56.841
Get him! Get him!
- Get him!

11:57.049 --> 11:59.427
l think he just got the wind
knocked back into him.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.768
Gus, why didn't you play in
high school? You're incredible.

12:07.976 --> 12:11.021
The whole bully thing, and jocks.
l didn't wanna deal with it.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.942
Those butts! You could've gone
to the Super Bowl.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.734
Yeah, that's the past.

12:15.943 --> 12:19.614
Hey, Richie, where's your brother?
- Howie! Come out, the guys are here.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.448
ls he still dealing with agoraphobia?

12:21.658 --> 12:24.159
Yeah, dude, he hasn't left the house
in six months.

12:25.369 --> 12:26.663
There he is.

12:26.870 --> 12:29.124
Hey, Howie.
- How's it going, buddy?

12:29.331 --> 12:31.625
Hey, guys.
How did hitting the balls go?

12:31.835 --> 12:35.796
We played an actual game
against real people. lt was classic.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.424
All these punk teenagers are like,
"Get off our field."

12:38.632 --> 12:41.719
We're like, "We'll play you for it."
And we did, and we beat them.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.973
I hit a foul, dude, it was sweet.
- lt was awesome.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.474
You gotta videotape it next time
so I can see.

12:47.684 --> 12:50.353
Buddy, just come with us.
- No. No.

12:50.562 --> 12:53.648
lt's not that scary. And you could use
a little sun, trust me.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.484
Outside, bad. The sun, scary.

12:56.692 --> 13:00.070
He's not my friend.
He wants to hurt me. Safe room.

13:00.572 --> 13:03.533
I know. Sun, bad. You, cuckoo.
- All right.

13:03.742 --> 13:06.411
You know the best part about
winning a baseball game?

13:06.619 --> 13:08.913
What's that?
- Going to Pizza Hut to celebrate.

13:09.539 --> 13:10.789
Richie?

13:12.458 --> 13:14.335
Oh, yeah. Okay, buddy.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.672
ls that apple juice?
- No.

13:20.549 --> 13:23.385
Honestly, you have
real natural athletic skills.

13:23.552 --> 13:25.304
You could be a terrific ball player.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.473
When you throw it to me,
and I catch it- -

13:27.682 --> 13:30.559
Not with my face, but with a glove.
- - I like it.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.854
l am starting to get the fever.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.232
Dude, this chick is so hot.

13:39.568 --> 13:40.861
What's going on?

13:41.070 --> 13:43.031
Nothing. Just refilling the bar.

13:44.239 --> 13:46.033
l love salad.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.661
Yeah, it's...

13:47.869 --> 13:49.203
...good and good for you.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.249
l love salad.

13:58.296 --> 14:00.382
That was some Barry White shit.
Very smooth.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.341
Yeah, I work it when I have to.

14:02.549 --> 14:06.679
How's "Ms. Pac- Man" treating you?
- That red ghost is kicking my balls.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.473
Yeah, that's them, Uncle Jerry.

14:10.849 --> 14:13.435
Richie Goodman and Clark Reedy?

14:13.645 --> 14:15.979
What were you losers doing
on my ball field today?

14:16.189 --> 14:18.065
Clark was. I was home.
- They were with me.

14:18.273 --> 14:21.945
We were just hitting balls. These kids
showed up and we scrimmaged them.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.905
That is priceless.

14:24.114 --> 14:27.575
Clork the Dork and Richie Bitchy
playing baseball.

14:27.783 --> 14:30.994
Why is that so funny?
- Because they're retards.

14:31.203 --> 14:34.624
They should stick to what they know:
boogers and dingleberries.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.044
You, stay away from my field...

14:38.252 --> 14:40.588
...or l'll have my 1 2- year- old nephew
kick your ass.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.341
Nice meeting you, Fairy Jerry.

14:46.343 --> 14:49.304
What was that?
- You gave them nicknames.

14:49.471 --> 14:52.182
l thought l'd give you one.
Fairy Jerry.

14:53.101 --> 14:55.478
Oh, really?
- Really.

14:55.687 --> 14:57.354
Okay, Gus.

14:58.440 --> 14:59.606
Gus....

14:59.815 --> 15:02.443
Gus Bus.
- What?

15:03.361 --> 15:05.195
That's you. Gus Bus.

15:06.697 --> 15:08.158
Wow, that was a brutal comeback.

15:08.616 --> 15:11.286
Let's go, guys. I don't think
l'll ever recover from that.

15:11.494 --> 15:12.745
Man.

15:13.203 --> 15:14.622
You stay off my field.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.791
Stay away from the fairy dust, Jerry.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.504
"Gus Bus"?
- Shut up, Troy.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.007
lt was the coolest, Gus.

15:24.215 --> 15:26.301
Never seen anybody stand up
to Jerry like that.

15:26.508 --> 15:29.804
l knew guys like that where I grew up.
They think they can do whatever.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.306
l just wanted to say...

15:31.513 --> 15:34.809
...that was great, the way
you put Jerry McDowell in his place.

15:35.018 --> 15:36.226
That was no big deal.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.229
Well, unfortunately for all of us...

15:38.437 --> 15:41.148
...Jerry's in charge of
the baseball league for the county.

15:42.359 --> 15:44.818
Hey. Are you the kid
that got farted on earlier?

15:45.028 --> 15:47.155
Yes. This is my son Nelson.

15:47.364 --> 15:50.075
He's become the fart magnet
for the neighborhood bullies.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.911
l also get a healthy smear
of animal turds twice daily.

15:54.119 --> 15:57.539
When I was your age, Fairy Jerry
dumped a bucket of dog poop on me.

15:57.749 --> 16:00.210
His son just did that to me
last week.

16:00.418 --> 16:03.546
l tried to talk to Jerry. He just laughed
and gave me a titty twister.

16:03.755 --> 16:06.382
Guys like that don't realize
the damage they're causing.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.426
l couldn't agree more.

16:17.559 --> 16:20.729
By the way, thanks for hitting
Kyle Wilson in the chest with the ball...

16:20.939 --> 16:23.400
...then letting me rip one
right in his mouth earlier.

16:23.607 --> 16:25.734
lt was one of the best days
of my life.

16:26.568 --> 16:28.362
This car is so radical.

16:28.570 --> 16:31.573
Looks just like K.l.T.T.
from the show "Knight Rider".

16:31.783 --> 16:33.283
lt is K.l.T.T. from "Knight Rider."

16:35.244 --> 16:36.705
Watch this.

16:36.913 --> 16:39.581
{y:i}Allow me to introduce myself.
{y:i}I'm K.I. T. T.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.293
Who are you?

16:44.004 --> 16:47.297
l'm just one of those nerds
who grew up...

16:47.507 --> 16:49.341
...to make billions.

16:50.135 --> 16:51.927
Maybe l'll see you guys
around sometime.

16:52.137 --> 16:54.054
{y:i}It was a pleasure to meet you all.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.390
{y:i}Easy, Mel.

17:03.356 --> 17:06.401
l have yet to perfect the peel- out.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.569
lt was fine.
- No, no, no. That was cool.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.488
Yeah.
- Chicks were checking you out.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.781
{y:i}Try not to destroy me
{y:i}completely, Mel.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.915
Hey, honey, l'm home.

17:22.540 --> 17:25.461
Where have you been?
- I was with Clark and Richie.

17:25.878 --> 17:30.091
l am on an ovulating schedule.
You were supposed to be here at 6:00.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.510
l thought you meant
Central Mountain Time.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.428
Did you mean
Pacific Standard Time?

17:34.636 --> 17:37.765
Why would you think that?
- Because you're from Colorado.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.352
Don't you ovulate
according to where you're born?

17:40.560 --> 17:41.770
Gus, that's just weird.

17:41.978 --> 17:45.439
So from now on,
it's Pacific Standard Time.

17:45.647 --> 17:48.442
Pacific Standard Time.
l'm all over that, baby. I love you.

17:52.113 --> 17:54.573
Check out this mitt. lt's all black.

17:54.782 --> 17:58.036
l look like a Borack warrior
from the "Captain Mighty" series.

18:01.538 --> 18:04.083
Well, get a load of Mega Mitt.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.797
Hey! Hey! What the- - ?

18:10.172 --> 18:11.633
Watch it!

18:12.175 --> 18:13.968
Clark? Richie?

18:14.177 --> 18:16.970
l hardly recognize you clowns
without underwear on your head.

18:17.180 --> 18:20.808
Brad. You have really
not slimmed down.

18:21.016 --> 18:22.352
Oh, eat me.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.437
So I heard from Jerry you tools
think you're athletes now.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.483
l didn't know "athlete"
had three syllables. "a- tha- lete."

18:28.692 --> 18:30.901
That's "ama- za- zing."

18:31.110 --> 18:34.155
You think you're hot shit
because you know words.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.949
Why don't you be a stud
and point us toward the register.

18:37.157 --> 18:40.036
Or "register- er."

18:40.203 --> 18:45.000
My team practices today at 5.
Swing by if you she- men wanna lose.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.168
You can't handle the truth!

18:48.378 --> 18:50.005
Bring it!
- Suck it!

18:57.678 --> 18:58.847
Gus!

18:59.431 --> 19:00.765
Gus!

19:01.682 --> 19:02.766
He can't hear us.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.026
Hey, fellas.

19:13.068 --> 19:17.031
You okay, Richie?
- Yeah, l'm fine. Just purple nuts.

19:17.239 --> 19:20.869
We just had a run- in with one of our
old bullies at the sporting goods store.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.870
What happened?
- He said we're wussies...

19:23.078 --> 19:24.956
...and he challenged us to a game.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.583
I don't know if you can leave work.
- Of course I can.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.961
l'll mow this later.
Let's take this guy down.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.213
l think l'm gonna puke.
Grab my arm.

19:33.797 --> 19:37.260
Bobby, this one's coming for you.
Focus and give us a double play now.

19:37.468 --> 19:38.969
Let's go!

19:40.972 --> 19:42.807
Thattaway. Good job.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.977
Looks like the Three Muske- queers
decided to show up.

19:46.186 --> 19:49.646
Everybody, get your butts in here.
Time for us to scrimmage some losers.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.525
Yeah, we got a "scrim- im- age."
Come on!

19:54.318 --> 19:56.321
How the hell will this work
with three guys?

19:56.529 --> 19:58.364
We got a pitcher, a catcher,
and a fielder.

19:58.572 --> 20:01.910
No, you've got a retarded paperboy,
a gay video clerk...

20:02.118 --> 20:03.744
...and a smelly midget.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.788
You wanna dance?
l'll dance on your face.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.999
Dance? We'll beat your ass.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.250
Death to you.
- Titty twister!

20:13.963 --> 20:17.050
My wife's the only one
who gets to twist these man- titties.

20:17.926 --> 20:20.511
l just know you guys better- -
Better come ready to play!

20:23.473 --> 20:25.599
Gus is the new Jet Li.

20:25.808 --> 20:26.935
Bring it on!

20:27.142 --> 20:29.270
Hey, Dad, come down
to the field, quick!

20:31.980 --> 20:33.400
Strike one!

20:33.733 --> 20:35.151
Strike two!

20:35.901 --> 20:37.237
Strike three!

20:37.444 --> 20:38.863
Hey!
- What? lt slipped.

20:40.739 --> 20:41.824
Strike three!

20:42.491 --> 20:44.202
Hey! What are you laughing at?

20:44.411 --> 20:45.869
He told me a joke.

20:49.207 --> 20:51.291
Let's go, Richie!
- Oh, yeah.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.753
Hey, Dad, come here. Look.

20:54.671 --> 20:58.800
Might wanna throw a fielder
up in those mountains, in case:

21:00.927 --> 21:02.344
What you got?
- Strike!

21:02.511 --> 21:05.056
Pulled something. Used to run track.

21:05.265 --> 21:06.640
Come on, Richie.

21:07.015 --> 21:11.520
Strike two!
- I didn't swing at that. Can't count it.

21:12.146 --> 21:13.313
Strike three!

21:15.775 --> 21:17.818
Could you tell him to slow it down?

21:19.362 --> 21:20.488
Did you tell him?

21:25.744 --> 21:27.369
Here you go, Clark.
- Thanks, Nelson.

21:27.578 --> 21:28.829
You're welcome.

21:33.042 --> 21:34.543
Home run!

21:36.046 --> 21:39.340
Yeah! Yeah, did you see that?

21:39.548 --> 21:41.801
All right! You hit another homer!

21:42.010 --> 21:44.345
Howie! He just hit a home run!

21:55.439 --> 21:57.942
Strike one! Strike two! Strike three!

21:58.151 --> 21:59.777
Can I get you a tennis racket?

22:01.988 --> 22:03.656
No!

22:11.413 --> 22:13.375
Bravo, gentlemen. Bravo.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.584
Great game.
- Hey, thanks, Mel.

22:15.793 --> 22:19.296
Say, guys, I have this sensational idea
l wanna run by you.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.006
Are you free for lunch tomorrow?

22:21.758 --> 22:26.470
l usually take lunch from 1 2 to 4:30,
so if it's in there I could handle it.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.682
Tomorrow is egg salad day...

22:28.890 --> 22:30.891
...but I guess I could
double up on lunch.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.227
Gus, what do you think?

22:32.435 --> 22:34.062
One sounds good.
- Great.

22:34.312 --> 22:37.732
l'm at 501 Shmegmer Street.

22:37.941 --> 22:39.526
See you then.
- See you, Nelson.

22:39.734 --> 22:42.404
Bye. Bye, guys.
- What do you think it's about?

22:42.612 --> 22:44.614
Dude, you're in trouble.
- No way.

22:44.781 --> 22:46.573
You're definitely busted.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.952
l didn't do anything. I swear!

22:56.291 --> 22:58.586
This is it?
- I always wondered who lived here.

22:58.795 --> 23:00.963
l just thought it was Clay Aiken
or something.

23:01.171 --> 23:03.800
"Who goes there?"
- That is so cool!

23:04.009 --> 23:06.218
lt's Gus, Clark and Richie.
We're here to see Mel.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.555
"You may enter."
- Thanks, Darth.

23:08.762 --> 23:09.806
"Thanks, Darth."

23:10.473 --> 23:14.519
This place is sick, yo.
- This house must cost a zillion dollars.

23:14.728 --> 23:16.729
Two zillion, actually.

23:16.937 --> 23:19.107
Hey, Mel. This place is incredible.

23:19.316 --> 23:22.526
Thank you, Gus. Gentlemen,
welcome to Chateau Shmegmer.

23:22.735 --> 23:25.238
Shall we adjourn
to the food quarters?

23:26.697 --> 23:30.452
Gentlemen, make yourselves
at home.

23:30.660 --> 23:32.953
Yoda! R2!

23:34.748 --> 23:36.416
Number 7!

23:40.295 --> 23:42.255
{y:i}Lunch is ready when you are,
{y:i}Mr. Carmichael.

23:42.505 --> 23:45.383
Hey, Number 7.
- "Don't touch me!"

23:45.592 --> 23:47.718
Gentlemen, let's eat.
Sit wherever you please.

23:51.014 --> 23:53.557
Gentlemen, order any kind
of sandwich you'd like.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.352
Number 7, thank you.

23:55.560 --> 23:59.605
l'll have a peanut- butter- and- jelly
sandwich with mayonnaise.

24:06.363 --> 24:09.281
Can I have tuna fish and Skittles...

24:09.490 --> 24:12.827
...and pudding skin on wheat,
with the crust cut off?

24:13.036 --> 24:14.536
{y:i}I guess so.

24:19.833 --> 24:21.920
That was radical!

24:22.128 --> 24:24.671
All right, I got a crazy one for you,
Number 7.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.509
l'd like a turkey on white- -

24:28.051 --> 24:29.343
He's good.

24:30.219 --> 24:31.512
So, what's on your mind, Mel?

24:31.720 --> 24:35.432
Gentlemen, it is time we brought
this cause into the public eye.

24:35.641 --> 24:39.229
What cause?
- The cause of the benchwarmers...

24:39.437 --> 24:43.191
...the kids who warm the bench while
the others get to play and have fun.

24:43.400 --> 24:48.029
All of us here in this room have been
excluded from athletic activities...

24:48.238 --> 24:51.323
...and now our kids are going through
the same tomfoolery.

24:51.532 --> 24:54.786
Now, Richie, do you have any kids?
- Never had a date.

24:55.286 --> 24:57.162
Clark?
- Never spoke to a girl.

25:01.583 --> 25:04.796
Gus?
- My wife and I are working on it.

25:05.380 --> 25:07.506
Well, when you do have them...

25:07.715 --> 25:10.885
...you will know how painful it is
to see them sad.

25:11.468 --> 25:13.470
"Bonjour", dudes.
- Hey, Nelson.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.473
How's it going?
- There's my man.

25:15.682 --> 25:19.477
Son, you have a little smear
of something on your cheek.

25:21.770 --> 25:22.980
From a dog or a cat?

25:25.108 --> 25:26.567
l think it's a goat.

25:27.943 --> 25:30.113
Number 7,
some assistance, please.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.120
Thanks, Number 7.
You're my best friend.

25:38.328 --> 25:40.165
{y:i}As you are mine, Nelson.

25:40.498 --> 25:41.583
That's so cool.

25:45.712 --> 25:48.422
Now, this is why I wanna start
a round- robin tournament...

25:48.630 --> 25:53.552
...with you incredible men against all
the notoriously mean- spirited teams.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.430
But why us three?

25:56.139 --> 25:59.391
Because you know what it feels like
to be left out.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.062
You're three grown men
who never got to play baseball...

26:02.312 --> 26:05.647
...because you were weird
and smelled and sat when you peed.

26:07.400 --> 26:10.612
Okay, the last one was just me.
But you get my point.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.947
But why would any of these teams
agree to play in this tournament?

26:17.118 --> 26:18.536
For the prize.

26:27.837 --> 26:29.046
That's incredible!
- Killer!

26:29.255 --> 26:31.465
An official- size stadium,
modeled to scale...

26:31.675 --> 26:34.635
...after all the greatest ballparks
in America.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.553
Like Wrigley, Fenway
and Yankee Stadium.

26:36.762 --> 26:40.140
Nelson and his buddies have set up
websites devoted to your team.

26:40.349 --> 26:43.812
You can go on Nerdly.net,
TheBenchwarmers.org...

26:44.020 --> 26:47.232
...or Please- stop- with- the- shit- tossing-
it's- getting- old.com.

26:47.439 --> 26:50.484
Why don't you just build a stadium
for Nelson and his buddies...

26:50.692 --> 26:53.363
...and keep everybody else out?
- That won't solve anything.

26:53.571 --> 26:55.364
Yeah, Clark.

26:55.572 --> 26:57.366
lf we can beat them
at their own game...

26:57.574 --> 27:00.203
...then kids like Nelson
and his buddies will get respect.

27:02.538 --> 27:04.541
We'll do it. Come on.

27:04.749 --> 27:07.836
Benchwarmers on three.
One, two, three.

27:08.043 --> 27:09.212
Benchwarmers!

27:09.421 --> 27:11.255
Can I get a napkin?
l spilled my ice cream.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.715
On the counter.

27:14.718 --> 27:17.886
Excuse me, sir.
Are you Gus Matthews?

27:18.095 --> 27:22.141
Sorry. I spit a lot when I speak.
People despise me for it.

27:22.391 --> 27:27.730
People spit. I mean, I spit
when I talk sometimes, too, you know?

27:27.938 --> 27:30.400
My name is Sammy.
They call me Sammy Sprinkler.

27:30.608 --> 27:34.571
Pleased to meet you, Sammy.
l'm Gus. Gus Bus.

27:34.738 --> 27:36.281
Hey, if I come to a game...

27:36.489 --> 27:38.449
...can I be your scorekeeper
and statistician?

27:38.657 --> 27:39.909
Certainly.
- Yes!

27:41.244 --> 27:44.748
All right. See you later, Sammy.
- You're the man, Gus. Peace out.

27:44.956 --> 27:46.333
All right.

27:47.208 --> 27:48.751
Who was that boy?

27:48.959 --> 27:52.630
l'm just seeing if he might be
interested in babysitting our triplets.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.925
Why are you spitting on me?
- Oh, l'm sorry, honey.

27:58.260 --> 27:59.720
This is idiotic.

27:59.928 --> 28:02.432
Are these guys serious about
this benchwarmer crap?

28:02.640 --> 28:05.894
lt sounds like it.
- l'm not playing in this stinking thing.

28:06.102 --> 28:09.521
lf there weren't nerds in the world,
who would we throw crap at?

28:09.772 --> 28:13.067
No doubt. But what if we don't play,
and they win it?

28:13.276 --> 28:15.652
They'll probably build
some weird nerd spaceship...

28:15.862 --> 28:19.406
...and fly it to Planet Booger
or something, I don't know.

28:21.284 --> 28:23.786
Now, guys,
it's one- game elimination.

28:23.953 --> 28:25.746
They're as good as done.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.248
You know what? You're right.

28:27.457 --> 28:31.628
Let's strap it on, and beat these three
geeks, and win us a new stadium.

28:31.836 --> 28:33.296
Let's get it on!

28:38.093 --> 28:40.260
This green one is sweet.
Oh, all right. Okay.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.931
We have a crowd, you guys.

28:43.556 --> 28:44.932
Excellent!

28:45.140 --> 28:47.142
Crap! What is she doing here?
- Who is it?

28:47.310 --> 28:50.771
lt's that salad chick from Pizza Hut.
- She's so hot, it's sick.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.774
Hey, she's with me.
- You wish.

28:53.233 --> 28:55.109
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How you feeling?

28:55.317 --> 28:58.738
l just destroyed that Porta- Potty,
but l'm feeling better.

28:58.989 --> 29:00.489
Who did this?

29:03.535 --> 29:04.786
Sorry!

29:04.994 --> 29:06.829
Listen, I got a gift for you.

29:08.498 --> 29:10.625
l never had my own uniform before.

29:10.833 --> 29:12.793
We can't have a team
without uniforms.

29:13.003 --> 29:16.005
l'm never taking this off.
This is the coolest thing ever.

29:16.213 --> 29:19.175
This is the first game of
the tournament. Let's go out styling.

29:20.218 --> 29:23.012
Nelson, you showed some serious
bat- retrieving skills last game.

29:23.220 --> 29:26.473
What do you say about being
the Benchwarmers' official batboy?

29:29.394 --> 29:30.729
That means yes!
- All right!

29:31.312 --> 29:34.189
Come on! What are we waiting for?
Let's kick some hairless ass!

29:36.359 --> 29:39.029
l had hair on my ass
before I could walk.

29:40.071 --> 29:41.322
This is it, kids.

29:41.531 --> 29:44.534
The Benchwarmers' quest
for a stadium is about to begin.

29:44.743 --> 29:47.161
Karl's!
- Karl's Auto Body, the bad guys...

29:47.411 --> 29:52.000
{y:i}...have taken the field in our Internet
{y:i}Podcast of Benchwarmers baseball.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.209
{y:i}First to bat, Richie Goodman.

29:54.418 --> 29:55.879
Fingers crossed.

29:56.129 --> 29:59.006
Come on, Richie.
- Easy out here. Let's go.

29:59.214 --> 30:00.425
The pitcher pitches....

30:00.633 --> 30:02.093
Strike!

30:02.635 --> 30:04.011
l ticked it.

30:06.848 --> 30:08.348
l ticked it again.

30:10.392 --> 30:11.853
Strike!

30:12.562 --> 30:14.063
Nice try, son.

30:14.271 --> 30:17.567
Just fouled two in front of salad girl.
- Nice.

30:17.776 --> 30:20.069
Next up to bat, Clark Reedy.

30:20.862 --> 30:23.281
All right, Clark. Here we go.
You're the man.

30:28.244 --> 30:30.287
Those squirrels are definitely out.

30:37.462 --> 30:39.588
That's my Miata! Kill him!

30:42.759 --> 30:44.093
Hey, break it up!

30:44.843 --> 30:46.053
Why is this happening?

30:47.262 --> 30:48.890
Come on! Snap his femur!

30:49.140 --> 30:50.808
Richie, help me!

30:51.685 --> 30:53.395
Help me!

30:53.603 --> 30:55.104
Mommy!

30:55.646 --> 30:56.647
Come on, Gus.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.483
We need it.
- You can do it.

31:07.449 --> 31:09.244
Home run!
- Yeah!

31:17.126 --> 31:18.253
Strike!

31:22.798 --> 31:23.967
Strike!

31:32.224 --> 31:34.102
Another one!

31:34.311 --> 31:36.520
Oh, my God!

31:37.020 --> 31:38.313
Strike!

31:39.941 --> 31:41.692
Strike!

31:47.197 --> 31:49.784
{y:i}Gus Bus! Gus Bus! Gus Bus!

31:51.578 --> 31:55.123
This can't just be about me.
l gotta get these guys more involved.

31:55.332 --> 31:58.125
Look alive, Clark!
- I wanna go home.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.878
No, we need you, buddy.

32:00.086 --> 32:02.005
No, you don't. l'm awful.

32:02.588 --> 32:03.797
Come on, now.

32:04.173 --> 32:05.383
Let's go, Tommy!

32:05.592 --> 32:08.218
This one's coming
right to you, Clark.

32:12.057 --> 32:14.141
lt's up, Clark! Clark!

32:14.350 --> 32:15.602
Clark, look out!

32:20.857 --> 32:22.025
Attaboy! Good job!

32:22.484 --> 32:24.068
All right! Good throw!

32:24.276 --> 32:25.987
Use your mitt, son, not your head!

32:32.869 --> 32:34.661
Get it in here, pal! Get it in here.

32:34.870 --> 32:37.457
Hold, hold, hold. Good job.

32:38.791 --> 32:40.793
Gus, come on. Let's end this.

32:41.001 --> 32:43.088
Two outs. Strike this kid out,
like before.

32:44.546 --> 32:46.048
A home run here would tie it up...

32:46.256 --> 32:49.218
...and knock the Benchwarmers
out of the tournament.

32:51.136 --> 32:53.348
There we go! Nice! Go! Run!

32:53.556 --> 32:54.682
Make the play, Clark!

32:55.182 --> 32:56.392
Clark, go!

33:00.396 --> 33:01.939
Pick up the ball!

33:02.941 --> 33:05.401
Run! Go, go, go!

33:07.737 --> 33:09.781
Richie! lncoming!

33:09.989 --> 33:11.699
What did you say?

33:11.907 --> 33:14.244
There we go! Nice! Go!
- Richie, get the ball!

33:14.452 --> 33:15.536
The ball?

33:19.749 --> 33:21.125
Behind you!

33:34.806 --> 33:36.223
You're out!

33:39.436 --> 33:40.687
What are you doing?!

33:41.395 --> 33:42.730
Yes!

34:02.083 --> 34:04.586
l'm sorry, honey,
we had another game today.

34:04.793 --> 34:06.504
l pulled a muscle
sliding into second.

34:06.713 --> 34:09.005
You gotta be kidding.
- lt's all right, I was safe.

34:09.590 --> 34:14.011
Gus, we're trying to start a family.
l can't do it by myself.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.931
l would hope not, because that
would make you a hermaphrodite.

34:17.139 --> 34:18.433
We don't want that.

34:18.641 --> 34:21.143
l'm glad this is a big joke to you.

34:21.311 --> 34:23.687
Honey, I was just having a little fun.

34:23.896 --> 34:26.231
Come on, don't go.

34:27.149 --> 34:29.985
Gentlemen, yesterday's performance
was phenomenal.

34:30.194 --> 34:34.572
All the online chat rooms
are exploding with enthusiasm.

34:35.282 --> 34:37.911
Hey, Mel, why aren't we out practicing
on the field?

34:38.119 --> 34:41.164
Well, I thought we could have
kind of a secret practice.

34:41.373 --> 34:43.458
Maybe become more well- rounded
as a unit.

34:43.666 --> 34:47.210
Nothing much.
Hitting, running, throwing, catching.

34:47.418 --> 34:50.672
Yeah, Clark.
- "I heard you stunk."

34:50.880 --> 34:53.176
Shut up, Number 7.
- "You shut up."

34:53.385 --> 34:54.467
l'll kill you.

34:54.677 --> 34:56.804
l want you guys to meet
an old friend of mine...

34:57.012 --> 34:58.807
...who knows a thing or two
about baseball.

34:59.015 --> 35:01.017
Ready when you are, buddy!

35:01.726 --> 35:04.395
ls that Mr. T?
- Dude, it's Dr. Dre.

35:04.604 --> 35:05.854
No, no.

35:06.063 --> 35:07.981
That's Reggie Jackson.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.150
Yeah, no, I don't know.

35:10.360 --> 35:13.363
Mr. October! Five hundred
and sixty- three home runs.

35:13.530 --> 35:14.989
Twice World Series MVP...

35:15.197 --> 35:17.199
...where he spanked
four consecutive home runs.

35:17.408 --> 35:18.742
Three on three pitches.

35:18.951 --> 35:22.038
Reggie bar and I met at tuba camp
when we were kids.

35:24.708 --> 35:26.583
Look at that.
- Oh, no way.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.877
That's you, Reggie?
- Why is that so funny?

35:29.086 --> 35:31.673
I was a cute kid.
- Oh, absolutely.

35:31.881 --> 35:33.675
You're like a young Denzel.

35:33.883 --> 35:35.677
l didn't know Denzel played Urkel.

35:36.385 --> 35:38.679
Reginator and I went through
some tough times...

35:38.887 --> 35:40.889
...with bullies and being picked on.

35:41.099 --> 35:43.518
l can't stand that stuff.
Drives me crazy!

35:44.060 --> 35:46.104
Crazy!
- Easy, buddy.

35:46.312 --> 35:48.313
Easy.

35:49.398 --> 35:51.443
Anyway,
l told Reggie- Reggie- Oxen- Free...

35:51.650 --> 35:53.862
...we're having problems
with our fundamentals.

35:54.070 --> 35:57.072
He agreed to come and help us
run some drills. lsn't that great?

35:57.239 --> 36:00.826
We'll do the same drills that I did
when I was a kid learning to play.

36:01.035 --> 36:01.702
All right.

36:01.702 --> 36:02.370
All right.

36:02.871 --> 36:04.039
Hey, so whose house is this?

36:05.206 --> 36:06.499
This is to teach you speed.

36:06.708 --> 36:09.668
How is standing here gonna teach us
speed? What are you doing?

36:09.877 --> 36:11.545
Hey, run!
- Why?

36:11.754 --> 36:13.298
Go, go!
- Reggie, you're nuts!

36:13.506 --> 36:14.758
Go, go, go!

36:14.966 --> 36:18.677
Who in the hell is it?!
l was freaking sleeping!

36:20.095 --> 36:21.889
Nobody messes with me!

36:22.097 --> 36:25.685
l will rip your throat out!
Do you hear me?!

36:25.894 --> 36:28.604
And I will find you!

36:30.606 --> 36:32.149
You're in the bushes!

36:34.444 --> 36:35.904
l'm sorry!

36:36.571 --> 36:39.531
l'm sorry! Go back to sleep!

36:46.456 --> 36:49.250
Come on, guys, let's go. Come on.
- Run, run, run.

36:58.968 --> 37:00.177
Who's there?

37:00.385 --> 37:02.388
You better run, you smart alecks!

37:02.638 --> 37:05.392
Who is it, Brad?
- Just a bunch of punks...

37:05.600 --> 37:07.269
...who better watch their backs!

37:07.477 --> 37:11.105
Relax, smarty pants.
Let's finish the massage.

37:11.522 --> 37:14.149
Brad have a pool?
- I don't think so.

37:15.819 --> 37:16.987
Yeah, I guess you're right.

37:17.195 --> 37:20.823
Oh, you little devil.
l'm gonna get you.

37:21.031 --> 37:21.990
Nightmares.

37:22.574 --> 37:26.454
This next drill, boys, is for your
catch- and- quick- release skills.

37:28.873 --> 37:30.083
Hot potato!

37:31.667 --> 37:32.876
No!

37:34.002 --> 37:35.839
Excellent, Clark.

37:36.047 --> 37:37.173
Clark, let it go!

37:41.343 --> 37:43.804
Throw it! Get rid of it!
- Come on, let it go!

37:44.888 --> 37:47.309
Release! Release! Release!

37:55.482 --> 37:56.860
{y:i}Sorry.

37:57.068 --> 37:58.111
{y:i}Oh, dear.

37:59.696 --> 38:00.697
{y:i}Well....

38:01.489 --> 38:04.825
The final drill is for
hand- eye coordination. Hit it, Mel!

38:06.201 --> 38:07.746
Let's go racing!

38:10.707 --> 38:13.208
Look at that! Excellent!
- That's insane!

38:14.501 --> 38:16.420
Yeah, baby!
- You got it, buddy.

38:17.254 --> 38:18.757
That's my friend!

38:22.552 --> 38:23.719
Give me the bat.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.596
Gus Bus! Gus Bus!

38:30.560 --> 38:32.020
Thattaway to go.

38:32.229 --> 38:33.354
Don't fall.

38:33.562 --> 38:36.815
You got it. You can do it.
- Hit it, baby!

38:38.108 --> 38:41.696
Man, you can do it. You can do it.
Let me see it.

38:43.072 --> 38:45.574
Clark, you're lucky l'm a billionaire.

38:47.368 --> 38:48.702
{y:i}The score is all tied up.

38:48.912 --> 38:52.332
The bottom of the sixth. This is
the Benchwarmers' closest battle yet.

38:53.250 --> 38:54.416
Strike.

38:54.917 --> 38:57.461
All right, Clark.
See the ball, be the ball.

38:59.172 --> 39:00.548
Strike two!

39:00.757 --> 39:03.051
Clark just made contact.
- With his own head.

39:03.260 --> 39:04.843
Grab real tight and concen- -

39:07.262 --> 39:09.056
Hey!

39:10.600 --> 39:13.311
Better distance that time. Yeah.
- Thanks.

39:13.520 --> 39:16.480
Richie's coming up.
The Benchwarmers need a hit here.

39:16.688 --> 39:18.440
All right, Richie, here we go.

39:18.649 --> 39:20.402
She's way out of your league.

39:21.111 --> 39:23.321
What's?
- You're probably a 39-year-old virgin.

39:23.530 --> 39:25.739
Women don't think that's too cute.

39:26.198 --> 39:28.867
Shouldn't you be at home,
like, combing your doll's hair?

39:29.076 --> 39:30.912
Shouldn't you be at home
blowing a doll up?

39:31.121 --> 39:33.748
That's the only action a tool like you
is ever gonna get.

39:37.292 --> 39:40.337
Take it out on the ball, not his head.

39:48.137 --> 39:49.430
Run! Run!

39:50.724 --> 39:52.100
Move your ass, Richie!

39:53.977 --> 39:56.979
Run, Richie, run!
- You got it! Way to run!

39:57.813 --> 39:59.940
Go! Go! Go!

40:01.608 --> 40:03.153
Slide if you have to!

40:04.029 --> 40:06.031
He's rounding third
and heading for home!

40:06.239 --> 40:07.656
Bring it, dork.

40:18.667 --> 40:20.377
Touch home plate!
Touch home plate!

40:20.586 --> 40:21.962
Richie, touch home!

40:24.049 --> 40:25.550
Safe!
- He scores!

40:25.759 --> 40:29.178
Benchwarmers win!
- lt's a miracle! lt's a miracle!

40:29.386 --> 40:30.804
l ain't a virgin now...

40:31.013 --> 40:33.725
...to home runs, beyotch!

40:41.273 --> 40:43.985
{y:i}The Benchwarmers win a close one
{y:i}on Richie's first home run...

40:44.194 --> 40:47.656
{y:i}...in the history of the universe.
{y:i}We'll see you in game three.

40:47.864 --> 40:49.990
I never hit it.
- Can we have your autographs?

40:50.240 --> 40:52.034
Are you serious?

40:52.284 --> 40:53.827
Yeah, you can.
- All right.

40:54.037 --> 40:55.622
Write my name on the ball?

40:55.872 --> 40:58.375
You see that home run?
Tell your sister about it.

40:58.583 --> 41:01.001
Wait, do you need my address too?

41:01.210 --> 41:05.840
You guys are making some noise.
This is music to my ear hair.

41:06.049 --> 41:08.677
My dad has ear hair.
lt's pretty scary.

41:08.885 --> 41:10.844
ls "badass" one or two words?

41:14.349 --> 41:17.769
How do they keep winning?!
- These guys are turd nuggets!

41:17.978 --> 41:19.937
Who wants to wrestle?
- l'm in.

41:20.145 --> 41:22.398
All right.
- l'm good, l'm good.

41:22.606 --> 41:23.857
Gotcha.

41:24.900 --> 41:27.112
Howie, look,
they're not gonna kill you, all right?

41:27.320 --> 41:29.281
They're dropping off
the cookies I ordered.

41:29.697 --> 41:31.073
They look very aggressive.

41:33.117 --> 41:35.662
I think they wanna beat me up.
- Trust me, you'll be fine.

41:35.870 --> 41:38.707
Just take the Thin Mints back
into the apartment.

41:38.915 --> 41:40.916
That's our food for the week.
- Fine.

41:41.083 --> 41:44.211
You can eat the Thin Mints
at my funeral, Richie.

41:54.722 --> 41:56.224
Hot. Hot.

41:56.433 --> 41:57.726
Hot sun.

42:03.564 --> 42:04.523
Cookie.

42:07.652 --> 42:09.821
Sun, bad! Sun, bad!

42:14.616 --> 42:15.826
Excuse me?

42:18.663 --> 42:21.249
Are you okay?
- How you doing? Yeah. Wrong pipe.

42:21.458 --> 42:25.085
No biggie. What's going on?
- Just returning these movies.

42:26.128 --> 42:29.424
Hey, well, l'm the management
so l'm gonna waive the late fee.

42:29.633 --> 42:32.593
Oh, they're not late. But thank you.

42:32.802 --> 42:36.764
Well, anything you want
in the store is free too, so....

42:36.972 --> 42:39.768
l'm Sarah,
and this is my brother Jarrett.

42:39.976 --> 42:42.770
He's a huge fan of yours
and the Benchwarmers.

42:43.812 --> 42:45.856
Cool. Thanks for cheering us on.

42:46.065 --> 42:47.608
Hey, what does "beyotch" mean?

42:48.818 --> 42:50.028
That's....

42:50.236 --> 42:52.697
That means "good game"
in Swedlandia.

42:52.906 --> 42:54.615
Well, we'll let you get back to work.

42:54.823 --> 42:57.701
Okay. But maybe l'll see you
at another game, hopefully?

42:57.910 --> 42:59.871
Yeah. Definitely.

43:00.080 --> 43:02.457
All right. See you, Jarrett.
- Beyotch yesterday.

43:05.334 --> 43:07.795
Marty, what do you think
of my future wife?

43:08.003 --> 43:10.882
l smell cinnamon rolls.

43:11.091 --> 43:13.677
Oh, I smell cinnamon rolls too.

43:15.260 --> 43:17.471
Gentlemen, check it out.

43:17.679 --> 43:21.476
Nerd headquarters.
Never felt more comfortable in my life.

43:21.685 --> 43:25.813
Hey, guys, take a gander at these.
We made your own baseball cards.

43:26.396 --> 43:27.898
Give me that.
- Let me see this.

43:28.107 --> 43:30.318
What?
- They got statistics.

43:30.527 --> 43:33.196
I hit 30 home runs.
- I got 1 1 foul ticks.

43:33.405 --> 43:37.324
l have 20 eyes- closed strikeouts, five
broken windshields, six dead birds.

43:37.533 --> 43:39.076
l'm freaking awesome!

43:39.284 --> 43:42.664
Now listen up. Brookdale and Candia
both advanced today.

43:42.872 --> 43:45.125
We have to beat them
to make it to the semifinals.

43:45.333 --> 43:47.960
Unfortunately, it is on
their own home turf.

43:48.168 --> 43:50.129
We'll have to hit the road
for a few days.

43:50.379 --> 43:52.882
Did you say Brookdale?
- Yeah, aren't you from Brookdale?

43:53.383 --> 43:55.260
Yeah.
- Oh, that's great.

43:55.468 --> 43:57.511
We'll have a big
welcome- home party for you.

43:57.719 --> 43:58.929
No!

43:59.138 --> 44:01.516
l mean, it's all right.

44:01.725 --> 44:03.351
l lost contact with everybody there.

44:03.560 --> 44:05.478
Wait, so we're staying overnight?

44:05.687 --> 44:07.688
Does my mother have to sign
a permission slip?

44:07.896 --> 44:09.773
No, but we will have to change
your diaper.

44:11.400 --> 44:13.028
Seriously, it's been three days.

44:13.778 --> 44:17.781
Sweetheart, I have to leave town
for a landscaping convention.

44:17.990 --> 44:20.409
You never mentioned
a landscaping convention before.

44:20.617 --> 44:22.537
l know. This is the first one.

44:22.746 --> 44:27.000
My ovulation schedule is delayed
because of the full moon anyway.

44:27.208 --> 44:28.375
So it's okay.

44:28.584 --> 44:31.712
Hey, Gussie,
imagine if we had a boy first...

44:31.920 --> 44:35.550
...and he grew up to be smart
and sweet and handsome.

44:35.759 --> 44:38.052
Or imagine he's only 3 feet tall...

44:38.260 --> 44:41.263
...and everybody in the school calls
him Midget Boy or Yoda.

44:41.472 --> 44:43.892
Then, just for fun,
they throw him into bowling pins...

44:44.100 --> 44:46.561
...and laugh until
they pee all over themselves.

44:48.354 --> 44:50.230
Were you Midget Boy or Yoda?

44:50.689 --> 44:51.899
l don't wanna talk about it.

44:52.107 --> 44:54.486
Just make some room, honey,
l gotta take a leak.

44:57.697 --> 45:00.115
Oh, my God, you're not kidding!
Gus, stop it!

45:10.375 --> 45:12.294
Mel is officially insane.

45:14.129 --> 45:15.966
Oh, my God.

45:17.968 --> 45:19.218
Right?

45:19.885 --> 45:23.514
Gus, how sick is this?
lt sleeps five and it's got Playstation.

45:23.722 --> 45:27.435
Check out the fridge, it's full of sweets.
l'm already on my third candy bar.

45:27.644 --> 45:30.354
Oh, man.
- Mother would not approve of this.

45:30.562 --> 45:32.064
That's creepy.

45:32.898 --> 45:34.900
What the hell is that?
- That's just Howie.

45:35.360 --> 45:38.280
Howie? You left the house.
Good for you.

45:38.488 --> 45:40.781
Richie told me about the killer
in the neighborhood.

45:40.989 --> 45:45.370
He's killing anyone named Howie.
That's my name. That's my name.

45:45.577 --> 45:46.955
Just go with it.

45:49.165 --> 45:52.793
Let's go, boys, we gotta be
in Candia by 2:00. Oh, FYl:

45:53.001 --> 45:56.339
This team we're playing is notorious
for egging comic- book conventions.

45:56.548 --> 45:57.882
Destroy them!

45:58.341 --> 45:59.843
Howie, you're a freak.

46:00.051 --> 46:02.344
Edgar, let's get this Gus Bus
on the road.

46:04.138 --> 46:06.808
{y:i}Game three. Benchwarmers vs.
{y:i}Standard Fence at Candia City Park.

46:08.685 --> 46:10.437
Are we here?
- Loser!

46:10.645 --> 46:11.687
l think we are.

46:11.895 --> 46:14.648
lt's sixth inning and the Benchwarmers
are down by one run...

46:14.857 --> 46:16.233
...with Clark Reedy up on deck.

46:19.279 --> 46:22.197
Clark, hold the bat.
- Wait. Why?

46:22.406 --> 46:24.074
That's good.
- What are you doing?

46:24.283 --> 46:26.160
Oh, I see.
- lt's gonna be great.

46:27.245 --> 46:29.539
Hey, Richie! I look like a mummy!

46:32.250 --> 46:34.209
God, it worked!
- Clark got a hit!

46:34.418 --> 46:36.336
Awesome!
- The other way!

46:36.545 --> 46:38.298
Come on, run it out!

46:40.091 --> 46:42.010
Let's go! Yeah!

46:42.218 --> 46:45.220
And Richie scores!
That ties it up, four to four!

46:45.429 --> 46:47.056
l made it! I made it! Yeah!

46:47.264 --> 46:49.017
Clark, bend down.

47:02.781 --> 47:05.532
What the heck was that?
l mean, come on!

47:05.741 --> 47:07.201
What a moron!

47:12.415 --> 47:16.043
The ball gets away from the catcher!
Gus goes to second!

47:17.419 --> 47:18.879
Go! He missed it!

47:19.089 --> 47:21.216
Hey! What the- - ? Let go!

47:23.635 --> 47:25.260
Go, Gus, go!
- You got it!

47:25.469 --> 47:29.264
Come on, over here! Third!
- I got it! You got it. You got it.

47:29.724 --> 47:32.727
Get the ball! Get the ball! Home!

47:33.436 --> 47:34.645
Yeah!

47:37.731 --> 47:39.608
lt burns.

47:40.402 --> 47:43.488
Hot.
- lt burns. lt burns.

47:43.697 --> 47:46.073
{y:i}And the Benchwarmers win it, 5- 4.

47:54.124 --> 47:56.250
Look at all these people.
We're like the Beatles.

47:56.458 --> 47:57.668
Or Wham! .

47:57.876 --> 47:59.461
Get your Benchwarmers souvenirs.

47:59.670 --> 48:01.589
Slide rules, pocket protectors,
pennants.

48:01.798 --> 48:03.133
We got everything you need.

48:04.509 --> 48:07.928
Welcome to Brookdale for game four.
Benchwarmers ball is on the lnternet.

48:09.388 --> 48:11.599
Coach Bellows, Gus Matthews
from the Benchwarmers.

48:11.808 --> 48:13.310
Shake hands
and have a good game.

48:13.518 --> 48:15.895
Matthews. That sounds familiar.
You from around here?

48:16.770 --> 48:18.063
No.

48:18.272 --> 48:20.357
l grew up on the North Pole.

48:20.566 --> 48:21.985
Not even close to here.

48:23.778 --> 48:25.113
And here's the pitch.

48:26.072 --> 48:27.865
lt's a high fly ball!

48:41.253 --> 48:44.466
Bad news.
The Benchwarmers are behind, 2-0.

48:44.674 --> 48:46.968
Gus is up. Clark's on third.

48:49.928 --> 48:51.638
He smacked that one!

48:56.686 --> 48:57.895
No!
- Relax.

48:58.104 --> 49:00.314
This game is all tied up.

49:12.368 --> 49:14.829
Richie hit a four-footer.
- Go, Richie!

49:15.038 --> 49:17.832
Run it out! Run it out! Get there!

49:18.666 --> 49:21.210
He's safe! He's safe! He's safe!

49:29.302 --> 49:31.678
Way to go! Run it out!
- He's rounding third.

49:34.264 --> 49:35.934
Richie scores!

49:36.142 --> 49:37.560
Clark overran third base.

49:39.854 --> 49:41.605
Safe!
- Yeah!

49:44.066 --> 49:46.903
Too high! Bad idea! Call 91 1 !

49:47.112 --> 49:51.949
That was close. Benchwarmers, 3-2.
Brookdale Glass is shattered!

49:52.491 --> 49:54.952
Hey, could we please leave, Mel?
- What? Oh, yeah, sure.

49:55.160 --> 49:56.705
Gus!

49:59.416 --> 50:01.125
Gus, maybe this'll relax you.

50:01.333 --> 50:03.252
Fresh off the presses
of "The Daily Shmegmer".

50:03.460 --> 50:04.545
We're on the front page.
- No way!

50:04.753 --> 50:08.758
"Benchwarmers Get Hizzot
and Rizoll lnto Semi- Fizinals."

50:08.967 --> 50:11.260
Mel, if my wife sees this,
l'm totally busted.

50:11.468 --> 50:12.970
Do not fret, my good man.

50:13.178 --> 50:16.224
Number 7 is covering
Clark's paper route.

50:22.938 --> 50:24.690
{y:i}Problem solved, Gus.

50:28.111 --> 50:30.530
Welcome to the semifinals
of Mel's tournament.

50:30.739 --> 50:34.491
Wayne's Hardware stands between
the Benchwarmers and the final game.

50:34.700 --> 50:38.204
Meanwhile, the nerd fans
are attempting their first wave ever.

50:39.664 --> 50:41.166
Hey, Jerry, what's going on?

50:41.374 --> 50:42.541
Who's this?

50:42.750 --> 50:46.420
l wanted you guys to have a little edge
today, so I brought my friend Carlos.

50:46.628 --> 50:50.675
He is from the Dominican Republic,
and he is one incredible ball player.

50:50.884 --> 50:52.260
Carlos, that's great.

50:52.468 --> 50:54.636
How old are you?
- I am 1 2.

50:55.637 --> 50:56.805
More like 1 200.

50:57.681 --> 50:59.643
Check my birth certificate.

50:59.851 --> 51:01.269
He's legit.

51:04.646 --> 51:06.774
You're kidding.
This is green crayon.

51:11.196 --> 51:12.906
That's your kid?

51:13.114 --> 51:15.949
Well, thanks a lot, Jerry,
but my team kicks ass.

51:16.158 --> 51:19.162
I think we'll be fine.
- Well, he's here if you need him.

51:20.622 --> 51:24.208
I need a refill.
- You need to go to an AA meeting.

51:25.793 --> 51:27.544
No, really. I need a refill.

51:35.511 --> 51:36.804
Here, hold this.

51:40.517 --> 51:42.060
Look, a vampire.

51:49.858 --> 51:51.444
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

51:57.366 --> 51:58.617
Strike three!

52:03.039 --> 52:04.416
lt's a hit parade!

52:11.881 --> 52:13.466
Time- out!

52:14.050 --> 52:16.343
lt's about time. You're in, you're in.
Give me that.

52:20.681 --> 52:23.810
Come on, "hombre."
We need "mucho" home run- o's.

52:32.694 --> 52:35.655
Dude, you smell like beer.
- You look like beer.

52:35.906 --> 52:38.449
Hey, who the hell's this guy?
- Sorry.

52:38.657 --> 52:40.617
ls he on your roster?
- Yeah, of course he is.

52:40.826 --> 52:43.204
He wasn't well earlier,
so I couldn't play him.

52:43.413 --> 52:45.624
"Mi" tummy "es" sick- o.

52:45.832 --> 52:48.333
This guy's 50. He's got a mustache.

52:48.584 --> 52:50.127
Not according to birth "certifico."

52:57.260 --> 53:00.054
He's got documentation. Play ball!

53:09.813 --> 53:12.107
Get out of here, baby!
Get out of here, baby!

53:12.316 --> 53:13.443
Yeah!

53:19.615 --> 53:21.325
{y:i}Oh, shit.

53:21.533 --> 53:24.162
Howie, listen, take this money...

53:24.371 --> 53:26.581
...go buy beer and tequila,
and come right back.

53:26.790 --> 53:29.083
Don't be scared.
- I don't wanna do that.

53:29.291 --> 53:30.667
Go, go, go.

53:30.876 --> 53:32.753
Nelson.
- You're all right.

53:35.632 --> 53:37.175
Strike three!

53:42.805 --> 53:44.849
You gotta step in the batter's box.

53:46.017 --> 53:47.602
l'm gonna kill your family.

53:51.480 --> 53:52.648
Yes!

53:56.152 --> 53:57.445
Yeah!
- Gone!

53:58.572 --> 54:00.948
Looks like the Gus Bus
is out of gas.

54:02.408 --> 54:03.742
l got it! I got it!

54:07.831 --> 54:09.457
That's what l'm talking about!

54:17.257 --> 54:20.635
Third inning, and the Benchwarmers
cling to a one- run lead.

54:20.843 --> 54:23.387
Your hair is like a waterfall.

54:23.595 --> 54:25.431
Thank you.
- Carlos.

54:25.639 --> 54:27.267
Who say my name?

54:28.685 --> 54:30.770
This is a present
from the Benchwarmers.

54:31.020 --> 54:32.980
You're really good at baseball.
Awesome.

54:33.522 --> 54:35.816
"Gracias," albino. Now get lost!

54:39.696 --> 54:42.865
Two outs and the Benchwarmers
hanging on, 6- 5.

54:52.625 --> 54:54.126
Go, go, go!
- Gus, go!

55:09.184 --> 55:11.019
Safe!
- Yes! He did it!

55:11.227 --> 55:13.312
He did it!
- No way! God!

55:19.819 --> 55:21.529
My hand!

55:21.738 --> 55:24.239
Top of the sixth,
Benchwarmers leading, 7- 5.

55:25.157 --> 55:28.327
That looks rough, dude.
ls it broken?

55:28.535 --> 55:30.288
lt's not broken, but I can't pitch.

55:30.497 --> 55:33.208
Richie, can you pitch?
- Hell, no, dude. I can't even catch.

55:33.416 --> 55:36.460
My vote is to have Clark pitch.
- Wait, why me?

55:36.668 --> 55:39.547
You throw newspapers.
You have to have some arm.

55:39.756 --> 55:42.717
Come on, come on. Let's go, guys.
- Clark, we have no other choice.

55:43.968 --> 55:46.261
What are you gonna do?
- l'll play the outfield.

55:46.470 --> 55:47.888
l can still catch pop flies.

55:49.099 --> 55:50.934
l'll try.

55:52.310 --> 55:53.895
l wonder if Clark pitched before.

55:56.855 --> 55:59.274
Nope.
- Come on, really burn it in.

56:01.987 --> 56:03.738
Ball three.

56:03.947 --> 56:05.406
Come on.

56:05.614 --> 56:07.074
Ball four. Take your base.

56:07.241 --> 56:11.246
Two- run lead. Bases are loaded,
and Carlos is coming up.

56:15.958 --> 56:17.418
One run scores.

56:20.462 --> 56:21.840
The tying run scores.

56:26.718 --> 56:29.596
Here comes the lead run!
And he is....

56:30.724 --> 56:33.435
Out!
- Oh, my God! What a play!

56:35.895 --> 56:39.648
We go to the bottom of the last inning,
and it's all tied up.

56:40.774 --> 56:43.653
Carlos, we need "tres" more outs
to go into extra innings.

56:43.862 --> 56:45.155
ls that beer?

56:45.363 --> 56:48.240
No, it's Gatorade, honky.
Just give me the ball.

56:50.492 --> 56:53.955
The Benchwarmers need something
against Carlos. He's unhittable.

56:57.583 --> 57:00.127
lt's a live ball! Run it out!
Clark, run it out!

57:05.216 --> 57:06.384
Yes!

57:09.386 --> 57:10.554
Maria...

57:10.763 --> 57:12.931
...why did you leave me?

57:13.850 --> 57:16.811
Letting a 1 2- year- old drink like that
is disgusting.

57:17.020 --> 57:19.354
{y:i}Here we go, Richie, here we go!

57:20.022 --> 57:23.025
Ball!
- Come on, ump, he's ducking it!

57:23.610 --> 57:26.321
Here we go, Richie, here we go!

57:26.488 --> 57:27.697
Take your base.

57:33.452 --> 57:35.705
Gus is up, and here's the pitch.

57:40.626 --> 57:42.252
Safe!

57:42.586 --> 57:44.381
Hey, who's on deck?

57:47.217 --> 57:49.552
Damn!
- Oh, no. They don't have anyone else.

57:49.760 --> 57:51.386
They have to forfeit.
- What?

57:51.595 --> 57:53.847
You have any reserve players?
- No.

57:54.056 --> 57:56.393
What about that guy over there
eating sun block?

58:00.896 --> 58:02.398
He's never played before.

58:02.606 --> 58:04.441
That's not my problem.
He's got a uniform.

58:05.485 --> 58:09.989
Hey, either he plays
or you forfeit the game. Play ball!

58:11.073 --> 58:15.160
Last inning, winning run's on third,
and it's all up to Howie.

58:21.542 --> 58:25.129
Look at this freak.
- Son, son. Get in the batter's box.

58:25.337 --> 58:26.423
Someone get his sword.

58:28.633 --> 58:31.343
Here you go, Howie. Take this.
- Nelson. Nelson.

58:31.552 --> 58:32.803
Get up and take a swing.

58:36.766 --> 58:38.810
Look at all those albinos.

58:40.979 --> 58:43.105
Wait till he pitches the ball, retard.

58:43.939 --> 58:45.441
Strike!

58:46.108 --> 58:47.986
They should let him use his sword.

58:49.863 --> 58:51.781
Maria!

58:52.406 --> 58:55.200
No.
- Come on, weird guy!

58:56.118 --> 58:59.789
{y:i}Weird guy! Weird guy! Weird guy!

59:10.634 --> 59:11.968
Take the base.

59:14.219 --> 59:16.847
No way! We win! We win!
- Amazing!

59:17.056 --> 59:20.685
You have to touch first base, kid.
- Come on, come on.

59:20.894 --> 59:23.771
Howie, hit by the pitch,
forces in the winning run...

59:23.979 --> 59:26.315
...and sends the Benchwarmers
to the finals!

59:26.523 --> 59:27.941
That's game.

59:33.031 --> 59:34.323
Carlos, you're drunk!

59:39.537 --> 59:42.082
We're here with Richie Goodman
of the Benchwarmers.

59:42.290 --> 59:43.625
How do you feel after that win?

59:43.833 --> 59:45.918
What can I say?
Baseball's in my blood.

59:46.168 --> 59:50.882
{y:i}Hey, could I give a shout- out
{y:i}to my main salad girl at Pizza Hut?

59:51.508 --> 59:53.677
{y:i}I like salad.

59:55.469 --> 59:57.137
Guys, can you believe this crap?

59:57.346 --> 01:00:00.225
l'd like to beat his ass,
just like I did back in the diz- ay.

01:00:00.433 --> 01:00:03.645
Are they any good?
- The only guy that's good is that guy.

01:00:04.562 --> 01:00:07.606
{y:i}This is Gus Matthews, the heart
{y:i}and soul of the Benchwarmers.

01:00:07.815 --> 01:00:09.316
Gus Matthews?

01:00:09.483 --> 01:00:10.777
{y:i}So were you bullied as a kid?

01:00:11.736 --> 01:00:15.823
{y:i}The bully thing affected my life pretty
{y:i}huge, and I wanna tell you kids...

01:00:16.031 --> 01:00:18.325
{y:i}...messing with other kids
{y:i}can do a lot of damage.

01:00:18.492 --> 01:00:22.163
What? That guy damaged more kids
than anybody I knew.

01:00:22.372 --> 01:00:23.999
He made my life hell growing up.

01:00:24.207 --> 01:00:26.792
You're twice his size.
You could crush that little puke.

01:00:27.042 --> 01:00:29.044
He didn't do the physical warfare.

01:00:29.253 --> 01:00:32.215
He played the psychological card
by attacking your weaknesses.

01:00:32.424 --> 01:00:34.676
l started losing my hair
when I was 9 years old.

01:00:34.884 --> 01:00:37.302
He jumped all over it
with the mean nicknames.

01:00:37.511 --> 01:00:39.346
Eight Ball, Bowling Ball...

01:00:39.555 --> 01:00:42.017
...Kojak, Mr. Clean,
Cream of Wheat Guy...

01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:46.312
...Scatman Crothers,
the Black Uncle Fester.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:49.273
How about the
Black Bodybuilding Charlie Brown?

01:00:49.481 --> 01:00:50.691
That's a good one.

01:00:50.858 --> 01:00:52.694
He used that too!

01:00:55.488 --> 01:00:58.991
Oh, don't cry, buddy.
l think your hair's the bomb, yo.

01:00:59.199 --> 01:01:02.245
lt looks great. Doesn't it, guys?
- Yeah.

01:01:02.454 --> 01:01:03.705
Really, brothers?
- Yeah.

01:01:03.872 --> 01:01:06.916
Sure, Daddy Warbucks. I would've
never have thought that was a wig.

01:01:07.125 --> 01:01:08.876
lf I was blindfolded.

01:01:10.419 --> 01:01:13.965
Got a problem? Why don't you punch
me in the face as hard as you can.

01:01:14.174 --> 01:01:17.885
Pour some honey on me.
Let me see you get really mad.

01:01:20.012 --> 01:01:23.767
Anyway, at least I left there
with my sanity.

01:01:23.975 --> 01:01:27.604
He actually teased this one midget boy
in our neighborhood league so bad...

01:01:27.812 --> 01:01:30.981
...the little fella up and quit baseball
and went into the loony bin.

01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:33.318
Guys, we gotta tell Jerry.
He's gonna love this.

01:01:34.736 --> 01:01:35.904
Definitely.
- Yeah.

01:01:37.239 --> 01:01:39.281
Really? Well, thanks, Cassandra.

01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:42.576
What's the score now, Mel?
- Well, Jerry's Lumber just won, 5- 2.

01:01:42.785 --> 01:01:44.663
That means our town
gets the stadium!

01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:47.749
Nelson and his buddies will,
because we'll kill those guys!

01:01:47.916 --> 01:01:49.416
Yeah! Wicked!

01:01:49.625 --> 01:01:52.127
Number 7, shakes all around!
- Yes!

01:01:52.336 --> 01:01:53.629
l gotta take a leak.

01:01:53.837 --> 01:01:56.383
Down the hall,
1 2th door on the right.

01:01:59.385 --> 01:02:02.096
{y:i}Last night, we did a story
{y:i}about the Benchwarmers...

01:02:02.304 --> 01:02:05.934
{y:i}...a team of three men who were
{y:i}excluded from baseball as kids...

01:02:06.142 --> 01:02:07.811
{y:i}...and are now making up
{y:i}for lost time.

01:02:09.562 --> 01:02:12.106
{y:i}Hello, Gus.
{y:i}This is the urinal speaking.

01:02:12.314 --> 01:02:15.944
{y:i}Chemical analysis of your pee shows
{y:i}you'd better stop eating fast food...

01:02:16.152 --> 01:02:18.113
{y:i}...or you're going to die.

01:02:19.197 --> 01:02:22.574
{y:i}We have just been given evidence
{y:i}that one of the men, Gus Matthews...

01:02:22.783 --> 01:02:24.993
{y:i}...is not the man
{y:i}he's been saying he is.

01:02:25.202 --> 01:02:27.455
Hey, no shake for me.
The toilet said so.

01:02:27.664 --> 01:02:30.125
{y:i}Gus Matthews was easily
{y:i}the biggest bully in Brookdale.

01:02:30.916 --> 01:02:34.294
{y:i}Well, you weren't the nicest kid
{y:i}in school either, Steven.

01:02:35.797 --> 01:02:37.132
{y:i}I hate everybody!

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:39.009
{y:i}What a baby. But he's right.

01:02:39.217 --> 01:02:42.386
{y:i}I was their principal back then,
{y:i}and Gus was in my office constantly.

01:02:42.594 --> 01:02:44.930
{y:i}I remember he especially
{y:i}picked so hard on one kid...

01:02:45.139 --> 01:02:46.975
{y:i}...that the poor boy
{y:i}was institutionalized.

01:02:47.183 --> 01:02:51.395
{y:i}That's really too bad. Those guys
{y:i}inspired a lot of really nice kids.

01:02:51.604 --> 01:02:54.606
{y:i}This is Kathy Dobson
{y:i}from Channel 9 news.

01:02:55.983 --> 01:02:59.154
You were a jerk just like the rest
of the kids who mess with me?

01:02:59.863 --> 01:03:02.531
l made a mistake, Nelson.

01:03:03.449 --> 01:03:06.243
l wish I could take it all back.

01:03:06.618 --> 01:03:09.372
l can't believe I looked up to you.

01:03:15.544 --> 01:03:17.629
l don't know what to say, guys.

01:03:19.382 --> 01:03:20.842
l'm sorry.

01:03:27.681 --> 01:03:29.517
{y:i}Let's party!

01:03:29.684 --> 01:03:32.103
Not now, Number 7!

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:39.527
ls that why you don't
wanna have kids, Gus?

01:03:42.113 --> 01:03:46.283
Do you feel you don't deserve
a happy family because of your past?

01:03:47.576 --> 01:03:51.623
l'm afraid that if we have kids, they're
gonna get picked on without mercy...

01:03:51.831 --> 01:03:54.666
...because karma
will be catching up with me.

01:03:54.875 --> 01:03:59.172
Sweetheart, you are wrong.
Life's about learning lessons.

01:03:59.714 --> 01:04:01.841
l can't just learn a lesson
and move on.

01:04:02.175 --> 01:04:04.552
That little boy that I picked on
when I was a kid...

01:04:04.718 --> 01:04:05.969
...he didn't ever move on.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:10.141
l bet he'd be able to move on
if you said you were sorry.

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.780
Can I help you?

01:04:25.406 --> 01:04:27.783
Marcus, honey.
- What is it, Mother?

01:04:28.242 --> 01:04:32.289
l just finished another peanut butter
sculpture. lt's a pterodactyl.

01:04:33.331 --> 01:04:37.292
Oh, that's nice.
You have a visitor, dear.

01:04:37.709 --> 01:04:39.503
But I don't know anyone.

01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:43.925
lt's Gus from grade school.

01:04:45.176 --> 01:04:46.802
No!

01:04:47.386 --> 01:04:48.762
Don't come down here!

01:04:51.516 --> 01:04:52.892
Marcus- -
- No, don't come down!

01:04:53.101 --> 01:04:55.562
Take it easy. Take it easy.

01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:57.980
Don't touch me!
- Please, hear me out.

01:04:58.188 --> 01:04:59.982
Just give me a chance.

01:05:04.821 --> 01:05:07.322
Marcus, stop trying to cast spells.

01:05:07.531 --> 01:05:09.867
Marcus- -
- Stay away!

01:05:14.039 --> 01:05:16.166
Look, Marcus, I want to apologize...

01:05:16.374 --> 01:05:19.710
...for all the nasty things I did to you
when we were kids.

01:05:19.918 --> 01:05:21.378
l'm not here to mess with you.

01:05:21.587 --> 01:05:24.674
You're lying to me
like all the other times.

01:05:24.883 --> 01:05:26.551
You are denied entry.

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.886
l'm sorry,
from the bottom of my heart.

01:05:29.094 --> 01:05:30.888
l was stupid, Marcus.

01:05:31.096 --> 01:05:35.810
Get out of my basement!
You're a bad, bad man! Go! Get out!

01:05:35.977 --> 01:05:38.104
l didn't expect you to forgive me.
l mean....

01:05:38.604 --> 01:05:39.897
Look, I know because of me...

01:05:40.105 --> 01:05:42.858
...you were never able to feel
what it was like to play ball...

01:05:43.068 --> 01:05:44.986
...or be part of a team.

01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:49.823
So I wanna
give you my hat, Marcus.

01:05:50.407 --> 01:05:52.701
Because even though
you didn't know it...

01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:55.497
...you are the heart and soul
of this squad.

01:05:58.458 --> 01:06:00.250
l'll see you around, buddy.

01:06:12.971 --> 01:06:14.264
Start here.

01:06:14.933 --> 01:06:17.894
You've got 24 hours.
- What, are you serious?

01:06:18.979 --> 01:06:22.481
lf you build it, nerds will come.

01:06:22.856 --> 01:06:25.860
And keep it under a billion.
lt's all l've got...

01:06:26.236 --> 01:06:27.570
...on me.

01:06:29.406 --> 01:06:30.489
Excellent!

01:06:30.697 --> 01:06:32.074
Okay, people!

01:06:32.282 --> 01:06:36.329
We got 24 hours to build us
a ballpark! Can we do it?

01:06:36.538 --> 01:06:38.373
Yeah!

01:06:58.018 --> 01:06:58.977
Cool!

01:06:59.185 --> 01:07:03.063
Are you kidding me? Look at this.
Dude, this place is huge!

01:07:03.272 --> 01:07:05.899
Swings!
- We'll go on the swings later.

01:07:06.108 --> 01:07:08.194
Slide.
- That's right, there's a pool.

01:07:08.403 --> 01:07:11.072
We'll all go in after.
- I forgot my floaties.

01:07:11.281 --> 01:07:13.866
We're here live in Greenfield
for the big game...

01:07:14.074 --> 01:07:16.452
...between the Benchwarmers
and Jerry's Lumber.

01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:19.331
The Benchwarmers were
recently rocked by scandal.

01:07:19.539 --> 01:07:21.249
Let's see what the fans have to say.

01:07:21.458 --> 01:07:24.418
Excuse me, sir. What do you think
of the accusations against Gus?

01:07:24.585 --> 01:07:28.131
His soul will perish in the fire pit
of the underworld.

01:07:30.508 --> 01:07:34.428
{y:i}There you have it. The fire pits.
{y:i}Not a good time.

01:07:35.387 --> 01:07:36.930
Around the horn.

01:07:38.433 --> 01:07:40.226
We could still win this thing.

01:07:40.435 --> 01:07:42.979
Wha- - ? How?
- lf we use the Force.

01:07:43.187 --> 01:07:45.898
Let's try not to be too geeky, Clark.

01:07:46.106 --> 01:07:48.818
The Force is powerful,
my young padawan.

01:07:49.027 --> 01:07:50.737
He's right. lt is.

01:07:51.279 --> 01:07:52.447
Hey, guys.

01:07:56.116 --> 01:07:58.243
l know l'm not
on the team anymore...

01:07:58.452 --> 01:08:01.706
...but I just wanted you to know that
l'm here to support you.

01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:04.333
Because you'll always be
my best friends.

01:08:06.293 --> 01:08:09.756
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Shmegmer Park...

01:08:09.964 --> 01:08:13.009
...and the final game
of Mel's Tournament...

01:08:13.218 --> 01:08:17.011
...of Little Baseballers
and Three Older Guys!

01:08:19.515 --> 01:08:20.975
Homo!

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.645
Hey, check out the little gnome.

01:08:26.854 --> 01:08:29.149
Play ball!

01:08:32.112 --> 01:08:33.154
Can I say something?

01:08:33.863 --> 01:08:35.156
Yeah, I guess so.

01:08:37.325 --> 01:08:40.078
Hand me the mike, please.
l can't reach it.

01:08:42.538 --> 01:08:46.250
Hello, everyone.
My name is Marcus Ellwood...

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:49.586
...better known
as Dragonmaster7 84.

01:08:49.795 --> 01:08:52.673
Or Yoda! Or Midget Boy!

01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:59.596
lt is true I ended up in an institution
as a child...

01:08:59.805 --> 01:09:02.350
...from Gus bullying me all the time.

01:09:02.767 --> 01:09:05.645
And he made my life miserable
for years.

01:09:05.854 --> 01:09:10.232
To be honest, I thought I would never
stop hating him.

01:09:12.818 --> 01:09:16.113
But then yesterday
he came to visit me in my basement.

01:09:17.365 --> 01:09:21.620
And as I cowered in my peanut butter
fort, he apologized to me.

01:09:22.162 --> 01:09:25.247
And I could hear the sadness
in his voice.

01:09:25.457 --> 01:09:27.541
This nerd makes me
seem like Rambo.

01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:28.876
l don't think so.

01:09:29.084 --> 01:09:31.461
John Stamos?
- Warmer.

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.883
And then, moments
after my old nemesis left...

01:09:36.091 --> 01:09:38.845
...l saw a hat on my stuffed moose.

01:09:39.054 --> 01:09:41.096
The hat of a Benchwarmer.

01:09:42.224 --> 01:09:46.228
A Benchwarmer begging
for a new start, just like me...

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:48.229
...and so many of you.

01:09:48.395 --> 01:09:52.232
He shouldn't get a new start! l'll never
forgive the kids who picked on me!

01:09:52.441 --> 01:09:53.399
Yeah!

01:09:53.609 --> 01:09:57.905
Young one,
life is too short to harbor hatred.

01:09:58.782 --> 01:10:01.451
Do you remember episode
number 38 of "Dungeon Wars"?

01:10:04.287 --> 01:10:08.583
The golden elves forgive the great
giants for destroying their village...

01:10:08.791 --> 01:10:12.085
...even though the giants
made the elves' life hell.

01:10:12.419 --> 01:10:15.672
The elves realized the giants
were tortured too.

01:10:20.762 --> 01:10:22.555
He's a modern- day Yoda.

01:10:22.764 --> 01:10:26.309
l mean, not his looks
but his philosophy stuff.

01:10:27.185 --> 01:10:30.437
Actually, his looks too. Yeah.
- His looks a little bit too, yeah.

01:10:30.604 --> 01:10:34.983
And so I forgive my new friend Gus,
as all of you should.

01:10:35.776 --> 01:10:39.446
Look at all the joy and hope
he's brought to all of us.

01:10:39.905 --> 01:10:42.117
He has more than paid his dues.

01:10:45.036 --> 01:10:47.539
Go, Gus!
- Come on, Marcus!

01:10:49.833 --> 01:10:52.626
Thank you, Marcus. Come on.

01:10:54.086 --> 01:10:56.547
Hey. Buddies for life.
- Thanks.

01:10:58.173 --> 01:11:01.428
I want a little man too.
- Here you go.

01:11:08.602 --> 01:11:13.230
Me and the guys have been playing
all these games, not for revenge.

01:11:13.438 --> 01:11:17.025
We did it to show that everyone
should be allowed to play baseball...

01:11:17.234 --> 01:11:18.485
...and have fun.

01:11:21.573 --> 01:11:26.202
And that is why Clark, Richie and l
will not be playing in the game today.

01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:31.791
lnstead, our team will consist of
kids who've never known...

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.918
...what it's like to play in front
of a crowd or to be cheered on.

01:11:35.127 --> 01:11:37.337
Let me tell you,
it's an awesome feeling.

01:11:37.504 --> 01:11:41.175
So please, put your nerd
and jock hands together...

01:11:41.383 --> 01:11:44.679
...and welcome to the field
the new Benchwarmers!

01:11:45.513 --> 01:11:46.932
Yeah!
- Hi!

01:11:48.308 --> 01:11:49.559
All right!

01:11:50.185 --> 01:11:54.187
Now, lastly, let's make some noise
for your new third- base coach:

01:11:54.396 --> 01:11:55.981
Marcus Ellwood!

01:11:59.193 --> 01:12:00.694
ls he all right?

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:04.282
For years I thought the sun
was a monster.

01:12:04.491 --> 01:12:08.620
l'm here to tell you that it's not
a monster. lt's not a monster!

01:12:08.828 --> 01:12:10.705
You're all right.
- Take him in the shade.

01:12:10.872 --> 01:12:12.707
All right, let's have some fun!

01:12:12.916 --> 01:12:14.666
{y:i}Hey, everybody,
{y:i}it's Clark and Richie...

01:12:14.875 --> 01:12:17.085
{y:i}...and we're standing in
{y:i}for Gretchen and Mitchell.

01:12:17.294 --> 01:12:20.047
And we're gonna get things going
right now. Big deck.

01:12:20.214 --> 01:12:21.840
He got it.

01:12:22.132 --> 01:12:23.592
Oh, no.

01:12:25.553 --> 01:12:26.805
And he's okay.

01:12:27.013 --> 01:12:29.391
Oh, hey, that's my helmet!
That's my helmet!

01:12:29.558 --> 01:12:31.268
lt's all right, buddy.

01:12:31.476 --> 01:12:33.103
Nice try, Sammy!

01:12:33.311 --> 01:12:36.355
Oh, my God, I just saw
your head for the first time.

01:12:36.563 --> 01:12:39.608
{y:i}Let's give a nice round of applause
{y:i}for little Sammy Sprinkler!

01:12:39.817 --> 01:12:41.610
He missed it
and people are cheering.

01:12:42.194 --> 01:12:44.154
Yeah, and his coach
didn't even yell at him.

01:12:44.363 --> 01:12:45.490
That's pretty cool.

01:12:45.699 --> 01:12:49.452
And here comes our lead- off hitter
with a familiar tape job.

01:12:49.661 --> 01:12:51.955
Gretchen, I know why
you're taping your hands.

01:12:52.330 --> 01:12:56.833
l also know why there's three squirrels
that won't be at this game today.

01:12:59.878 --> 01:13:01.296
Strike! Strike! Strike!

01:13:01.505 --> 01:13:02.756
Well, there's a strikeout.

01:13:02.923 --> 01:13:04.925
That's okay! Good try! Good try!

01:13:05.384 --> 01:13:06.511
Good going, Gretchen.

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:08.555
All right, next up it's Jarrett.

01:13:08.763 --> 01:13:12.184
lf you know Jarrett, you know his sister
works at Pizza Hut. She's over there.

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.771
Another strikeout.

01:13:19.773 --> 01:13:22.651
And a strikeout. Strikeout.

01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:24.778
Strikeout. Strikeout. Strikeout.

01:13:25.529 --> 01:13:26.865
And a strikeout.

01:13:27.073 --> 01:13:29.034
l think we got a free stadium!

01:13:29.242 --> 01:13:30.952
Clark, we're beating them
in strikeouts.

01:13:31.161 --> 01:13:33.955
And you're also beating them
in boogers picked, so we got that.

01:13:37.625 --> 01:13:41.295
Good game. Drive home safe tonight.
On the yellow brick road.

01:13:41.962 --> 01:13:43.213
God, he's a dick.

01:13:45.966 --> 01:13:48.386
He got all of that one.
Back, back, back!

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:52.807
ln the pool!

01:13:53.266 --> 01:13:54.559
Good hit, Kyle.

01:13:55.227 --> 01:13:57.479
Yeah, nice one, Kyle.

01:13:59.062 --> 01:14:00.063
Go, Kyle!

01:14:01.565 --> 01:14:04.443
Well, it's 42 to nothing as we head
into the last inning.

01:14:04.651 --> 01:14:08.323
And it looks like the Benchwarmers
will go down without a fight.

01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:10.784
Hey. What are you smiling at?

01:14:10.992 --> 01:14:12.911
l guess how much fun
they're having.

01:14:13.119 --> 01:14:15.664
Wipe the smile off your face
or l'll wipe it off for you.

01:14:15.872 --> 01:14:16.915
You got three more outs.

01:14:17.124 --> 01:14:20.000
You blow this shutout, you won't play
on a team next year. Got it?

01:14:20.209 --> 01:14:22.377
Get out there and annihilate
those stinkweeds!

01:14:23.170 --> 01:14:24.713
Let's go!

01:14:24.922 --> 01:14:26.840
Come on, let's do this!

01:14:29.511 --> 01:14:30.637
Strike one!

01:14:30.845 --> 01:14:32.180
Hang in there, son!

01:14:32.514 --> 01:14:34.015
Come on, Nelson!

01:14:35.267 --> 01:14:36.726
Strike two!

01:14:36.935 --> 01:14:38.687
Come on, strike out this loser!

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:42.314
You know what? You're the loser.

01:14:44.358 --> 01:14:45.692
Time!

01:14:46.193 --> 01:14:48.612
What's up, buddy?
- Hey, Nelson.

01:14:48.821 --> 01:14:51.366
l'll throw you one down the middle.
- What does that mean?

01:14:51.574 --> 01:14:54.202
lt means choke up on the bat a little
and swing away.

01:14:54.411 --> 01:14:57.455
The ball's gonna be right there.
- Hey, thanks.

01:14:57.664 --> 01:15:00.708
l can help you with your social studies
homework later if you need it.

01:15:00.916 --> 01:15:03.752
Sounds good.
l suck at social studies.

01:15:03.961 --> 01:15:05.879
Okay, guys, follow my lead.

01:15:12.345 --> 01:15:14.097
Butterfingers.
- He got a hit!

01:15:14.306 --> 01:15:17.100
Come on! Go, go!
- Oh, my God!

01:15:17.392 --> 01:15:18.935
Why are you kicking it?!

01:15:19.144 --> 01:15:20.395
Go, go!

01:15:29.027 --> 01:15:30.571
Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

01:15:30.779 --> 01:15:34.576
Run! Come on! Go! Go! Go home!

01:15:34.784 --> 01:15:36.077
Go, go, go!
- Go, Nelson!

01:15:36.244 --> 01:15:38.121
Nelson, get at the plate!

01:15:39.623 --> 01:15:41.708
Slide! Slide!

01:15:41.916 --> 01:15:42.916
Safe!

01:15:44.293 --> 01:15:46.336
We did not get shut out!

01:16:02.479 --> 01:16:06.523
What is going on? What is going on?
Let go of me! Nerds!

01:16:07.983 --> 01:16:10.277
You put me down!
What is going on?

01:16:34.636 --> 01:16:37.472
Can I let you in on a secret?
- Sure.

01:16:37.639 --> 01:16:42.310
l've never actually, like, totally,
100-percent kissed a girl before...

01:16:42.602 --> 01:16:46.688
...and I was wondering
if you would be my first one.

01:16:47.981 --> 01:16:49.608
l would like nothing more than that.

01:16:51.652 --> 01:16:52.778
Rea...?

01:16:52.986 --> 01:16:54.196
Clark!

01:16:55.407 --> 01:16:57.033
You kissed a girl before I did?

01:16:57.492 --> 01:17:00.287
This is way better than macaroni.

01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:07.543
l'm not afraid of the sun anymore.

01:17:07.751 --> 01:17:10.546
That's good, buddy.
How's the moon treating you?

01:17:10.754 --> 01:17:12.256
Not a fan.

01:17:14.299 --> 01:17:17.512
Hey, Gus. The new Benchwarmers
are gonna need a coach next season.

01:17:17.679 --> 01:17:19.014
What do you say?

01:17:19.222 --> 01:17:20.515
l'd be honored, Mel...

01:17:20.682 --> 01:17:23.477
...but I might be a little busy
getting my family started.

01:17:24.519 --> 01:17:27.521
Actually, honey,
it's already been started.

01:17:29.857 --> 01:17:31.066
Really?

01:17:33.527 --> 01:17:34.862
Hey, everybody!

01:17:35.362 --> 01:17:37.240
l'm gonna be a dad!

01:17:43.997 --> 01:17:47.083
That's quite an ovation.
- You wanna hear an even bigger one?

01:17:47.291 --> 01:17:51.336
The reason she's pregnant is
because I went all the way with her!

01:17:58.678 --> 01:18:02.015
That's so great.
What does "all the way" mean?

01:18:03.305 --> 01:18:09.338
