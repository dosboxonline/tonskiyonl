01:31.023 --> 01:37.371
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

01:38.764 --> 01:40.766
I want mead!

01:40.966 --> 01:43.378
Give me some mead, my Queen!

01:48.407 --> 01:52.822
Thank you, my beautiful Queen.

01:57.183 --> 01:59.993
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

02:04.290 --> 02:06.426
This is how it works, Aesher.

02:06.626 --> 02:10.163
After you die,
you wouldn't really be dead

02:10.363 --> 02:15.278
providing you have accepted him
as the one and only God.

02:26.246 --> 02:28.749
All right, back! Back!

02:51.172 --> 02:52.740
Here, my beauty, give me a kiss.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.876
I want a kiss! Give me a kiss!
I want a kiss!

02:56.076 --> 02:58.049
Please, stop it!

03:02.983 --> 03:04.154
More!

03:06.720 --> 03:09.991
My thanes, my beautiful thanes!

03:10.191 --> 03:13.327
One year ago, I, Hrothgar, your King

03:13.527 --> 03:16.464
swore that we would
celebrate our victories

03:16.664 --> 03:20.036
in a new hall, mighty and beautiful!

03:20.702 --> 03:24.072
Have I not kept my oath? Yeah.

03:24.272 --> 03:29.544
In this hall, we shall divide
the spoils of our conquests,

03:29.744 --> 03:31.747
the gold and the treasure.

03:31.947 --> 03:37.123
And this shall be a place of merriment,
joy, and fornication!

03:41.723 --> 03:47.798
From now until the end of time,
I name this hall Herot!

03:50.332 --> 03:53.711
Treasure!
Let's hand out some treasure!

03:55.170 --> 03:56.724
Give me some of that!

03:56.924 --> 03:58.478
From my conquests!

04:00.243 --> 04:01.911
Unferth!

04:02.111 --> 04:07.650
For Unferth, for Unferth,
my wisest advisor,

04:07.850 --> 04:13.389
violator of virgins
and best and bravest of brave brawlers.

04:13.589 --> 04:19.128
Unferth, where the hell are you,
you weasel-faced bastard?

04:19.327 --> 04:21.471
I'm here, my King.

04:22.665 --> 04:26.078
Unferth, come here, you ungrateful lout!

04:38.047 --> 04:43.954
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

04:44.154 --> 04:47.858
He faced a demon dragon
When other men would freeze

04:48.058 --> 04:52.062
And then, my lords, he took his sword
And brought it to its knees...

04:52.262 --> 04:53.764
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

04:53.964 --> 04:56.569
The greatest of our kings

04:57.834 --> 05:00.405
He broke the dragon's wings

05:01.104 --> 05:03.140
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

05:03.840 --> 05:07.945
The kingdom fell in darkness
And shadows ruled the night

05:08.145 --> 05:12.182
With no sign of dawn, he soldiered on
And brought us back to life

05:12.382 --> 05:13.884
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

05:14.084 --> 05:16.053
He never shook your faith

05:16.253 --> 05:18.307
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

05:18.507 --> 05:20.562
Let every cup be raised

05:21.025 --> 05:23.869
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

06:32.097 --> 06:36.086
He offered us protection
When monsters roamed the land

06:36.286 --> 06:40.276
And one by one, he took them on
They perished at his hand

06:41.540 --> 06:43.246
Mead!

06:44.144 --> 06:45.645
Mead!

06:46.513 --> 06:47.847
Mead!

06:48.047 --> 06:51.985
You're spilling it. Where's my mead?
You're spilling it.

06:52.185 --> 06:53.794
You're spilling it!

06:54.687 --> 06:56.690
Cain, you clumsy idiot!

06:56.890 --> 06:59.529
How dare you waste the King's mead?

07:09.202 --> 07:13.173
He rose up like a savior
When every hope was gone

07:13.373 --> 07:15.241
The beast was gored
and peace restored

07:15.441 --> 07:17.093
His memory will live on

07:17.293 --> 07:19.120
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

07:19.320 --> 07:21.001
Let every cup be raised

07:21.201 --> 07:23.330
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

07:23.530 --> 07:25.659
Now and forever

08:47.802 --> 08:50.476
A sword! Give me a sword!

08:57.647 --> 08:59.649
Come! Arm yourselves!

09:01.717 --> 09:03.594
Stay down, my Lady!

09:20.303 --> 09:22.476
- Give me a sword! A sword!
- My Lord!

10:07.751 --> 10:09.457
No!

10:43.388 --> 10:44.662
Fight me!

10:46.157 --> 10:47.465
Fight me!

10:51.629 --> 10:53.005
Fight me.

11:36.609 --> 11:39.112
You fight me, damn you.

11:41.214 --> 11:42.385
Nay.

12:28.662 --> 12:30.937
What was that?

12:33.901 --> 12:35.505
Grendel.

12:45.112 --> 12:48.684
Grendel, what have you done?

12:49.884 --> 12:53.126
What have you done, Grendel?

13:00.262 --> 13:03.632
Fish and wolf and bear

13:03.832 --> 13:05.734
and sheep or two,

13:05.934 --> 13:07.975
ac nan men.

13:20.782 --> 13:22.522
Men, Grendel.

13:23.485 --> 13:26.693
They have slain so many of our kind.

13:59.622 --> 14:02.693
Was Hrothgar there?

14:13.469 --> 14:14.913
Good.

14:15.571 --> 14:17.560
Good boy.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.750
And tender.

14:32.990 --> 14:36.060
Men, build another pyre!

14:36.260 --> 14:38.829
There's dry wood behind the stables.

14:39.029 --> 14:40.764
Then burn the dead.

14:40.964 --> 14:44.668
And seal the hall!
Close the doors and the windows.

14:44.868 --> 14:46.236
And by the King's order,

14:46.436 --> 14:49.906
there should be no singing
or merrymaking of any kind.

14:51.041 --> 14:53.111
This place reeks of death.

14:55.078 --> 14:57.614
The scops are singing
the shame of Herot

14:57.814 --> 15:01.802
as far south as the middle kingdom
and as far north as the ice-lands.

15:02.002 --> 15:05.990
I've let it be known that
I will give half the gold in my kingdom

15:06.190 --> 15:08.593
to any man who can rid us of Grendel.

15:08.793 --> 15:10.161
My King, for deliverance

15:10.361 --> 15:15.099
our people sacrifice goats and sheep
to Odin and Heimdall.

15:15.299 --> 15:17.068
With your permission,

15:17.268 --> 15:21.806
shall we also pray
to the new Roman god, Christ Jesus?

15:22.006 --> 15:24.718
Perhaps he can lift our affliction.

15:26.411 --> 15:28.686
No, Unferth, no.

15:29.147 --> 15:33.318
No, the gods will do nothing for us
that we will not do for ourselves.

15:33.518 --> 15:34.853
What we need is a hero.

15:42.593 --> 15:44.367
Hold your oars up!

15:47.032 --> 15:48.602
And heave!

15:52.171 --> 15:55.774
Can you see the coast?
Can you see the Danes' guide-fire?

15:55.974 --> 15:58.977
I see nothing but the wind and the rain!

15:59.177 --> 16:02.181
No fire, no stars by which to navigate.

16:02.381 --> 16:05.084
We're lost! Given to the sea!

16:05.284 --> 16:06.552
The sea's my mother!

16:06.752 --> 16:09.755
She'll never take me back
to her murky womb.

16:19.865 --> 16:21.700
My mother was a fishwife in Uppland.

16:21.900 --> 16:25.506
I was rather hoping to die in battle
as a warrior should!

16:28.074 --> 16:29.518
Heave!

16:31.878 --> 16:35.291
The men are worried
the storm has no end, Beowulf.

16:35.915 --> 16:38.851
It's no earthly storm,
that much is for sure.

16:39.051 --> 16:41.988
But this demon's tempest
will not hold us out

16:42.188 --> 16:44.695
if we really want in!

16:48.028 --> 16:49.829
Who wants to live?

16:50.029 --> 16:51.231
We do!

16:51.431 --> 16:55.201
Then pull your oars! Let's see you do it!

16:55.401 --> 16:57.186
For Beowulf!

16:57.386 --> 16:58.850
For gold!

16:59.050 --> 17:00.514
For glory!

17:22.128 --> 17:25.337
Heave! Heave!

17:27.101 --> 17:29.945
Heave! Heave!

17:40.347 --> 17:41.704
Beowulf.

17:41.904 --> 17:43.261
Hold fast!

17:45.119 --> 17:46.120
No.

18:03.105 --> 18:06.341
Who are you?
From your dress, you are warriors.

18:06.541 --> 18:09.778
Speak! Why should I
not run you through right now?

18:09.978 --> 18:12.114
We are Geats.

18:12.314 --> 18:14.987
I am Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow.

18:16.418 --> 18:20.522
We come seeking your Prince Hrothgar
in friendship.

18:20.722 --> 18:23.325
They say you have a monster here?

18:23.525 --> 18:26.128
They say your lands are cursed.

18:26.328 --> 18:27.029
Is that what they say?

18:27.229 --> 18:28.897
Bards sing of Hrothgar's shame

18:29.097 --> 18:31.733
from the frozen North
to the shores of Vinland.

18:31.933 --> 18:33.403
There's no shame
to be accursed by demons!

18:33.603 --> 18:37.949
I am Beowulf!
And I am here to kill your monster.

18:40.776 --> 18:43.412
I thought there were no more heroes
foolish enough

18:43.612 --> 18:47.171
to come around here
and die for our gold.

18:47.371 --> 18:50.931
If we die, it'll be for glory, not for gold.

19:03.366 --> 19:05.034
My Lord?

19:05.234 --> 19:08.704
My Lord?
There are warriors outside. Geats.

19:08.904 --> 19:09.973
But they are no beggars,

19:10.173 --> 19:11.841
and their leader Beowulf
is an imposing...

19:12.041 --> 19:14.184
Beowulf? Ecgtheow's little boy?

19:15.245 --> 19:16.814
Beowulf. Where is he? Where?

19:17.014 --> 19:19.756
There you are.
Beowulf, welcome, my boy.

19:20.717 --> 19:24.154
Welcome. Yes. How's your father?

19:24.354 --> 19:25.456
Dead.

19:25.656 --> 19:28.792
Died in battle with sea-raiders
two winters back.

19:28.992 --> 19:30.594
Well, he was a brave man.

19:30.794 --> 19:33.730
May I ask why you have come to us
from across the sea?

19:33.930 --> 19:36.005
I've come to kill your monster.

19:37.301 --> 19:40.404
And to taste that famous mead of yours.

19:40.604 --> 19:45.018
There have been many brave men
who have come to taste my Lord's mead

19:46.944 --> 19:51.415
and many who have sworn
to rid his hall of our nightmare.

19:52.416 --> 19:56.254
But in the morning,
there was nothing left of any of them

19:56.454 --> 19:58.996
but blood to be cleaned from the floor

19:59.657 --> 20:02.637
and the benches, and the walls.

20:08.266 --> 20:12.179
I have drunk nothing, yet.

20:13.871 --> 20:16.574
But I will kill your monster.

20:16.774 --> 20:21.913
He will kill the monster.
Did you hear that? Grendel will die.

20:22.113 --> 20:25.019
- Grendel?
- Yeah, the monster is called Grendel.

20:26.351 --> 20:29.154
Then I will kill your Grendel.

20:29.354 --> 20:33.658
I, Beowulf,
killed a tribe of giants on the Orkneys,

20:33.858 --> 20:36.728
crushed the skulls of sea-serpents,

20:36.928 --> 20:41.249
and this troll of yours
will trouble you no more.

20:41.449 --> 20:45.571
A hero! A hero!
I knew the sea would bring us a hero!

20:45.771 --> 20:49.241
So will you go up to the moors,
to the dark pool by the cave

20:49.441 --> 20:50.976
and kill the monster in its den?

20:51.176 --> 20:56.250
I have 14 brave thanes with me.
We have been long at sea.

20:58.284 --> 21:03.489
It is high time, mighty Hrothgar,
to break open your golden mead

21:03.689 --> 21:05.157
famed across the world

21:05.357 --> 21:09.829
and to feast
in your legendary mead hall.

21:10.029 --> 21:13.737
The mead hall has been sealed
by his Lord's order.

21:13.937 --> 21:17.645
Merrymaking in the hall
brings the devil, Grendel.

21:21.474 --> 21:22.918
Well, then.

21:23.977 --> 21:26.684
Open the mead hall! Let's drink!

22:07.822 --> 22:10.666
We don't want any trouble
with the locals.

22:11.625 --> 22:15.028
Hondshew, make me feel
you're pretending to listen to me.

22:15.228 --> 22:19.065
It's only been five days
since you waved your wife goodbye.

22:19.265 --> 22:23.103
Five days? In the name of Odin,
no wonder my loins are burning!

22:28.376 --> 22:30.578
Beowulf, there you are.

22:30.778 --> 22:33.814
I was thinking about your father.
Great man.

22:34.014 --> 22:35.016
He was fleeing the Wulfings

22:35.216 --> 22:37.918
and he'd killed one of them
with his bare hands.

22:38.118 --> 22:40.621
- Heatholaf.
- That's it, yeah. That's right.

22:40.821 --> 22:45.694
I paid the blood debt for your father,
and he swore his oath to me.

22:45.894 --> 22:49.767
So I saved his skin,
and you're here to save ours, that right?

22:57.205 --> 23:00.442
All hail the great Beowulf,

23:00.642 --> 23:05.352
come to save
our pathetic Danish skins, eh?

23:06.648 --> 23:11.353
And we are so damned grateful,
mighty Beowulf.

23:11.553 --> 23:17.503
But can I ask a question,
as a huge admirer of yours?

23:24.199 --> 23:27.971
There was another Beowulf
I heard tell of

23:28.171 --> 23:33.143
who challenged Brecca the Mighty to
a swimming race out on the open sea.

23:34.944 --> 23:36.212
Was that you?

23:36.412 --> 23:38.619
I swam against Brecca.

23:43.619 --> 23:47.957
Because I thought
it had to be a different Beowulf,

23:48.157 --> 23:50.727
someone else of the same name.

23:50.927 --> 23:55.398
Because, you see,
the Beowulf I heard of

23:55.598 --> 23:59.073
swam against Brecca and lost.

23:59.802 --> 24:03.573
He risked his life and Brecca's

24:03.773 --> 24:07.544
to serve his own vanity and pride.

24:07.744 --> 24:10.047
A boastful fool.

24:10.714 --> 24:13.023
And he lost!

24:14.251 --> 24:17.960
So I thought it had to be someone else.

24:21.258 --> 24:23.761
I swam against Brecca.

24:24.628 --> 24:28.699
But victory was his, not yours.

24:28.899 --> 24:34.041
A mighty warrior who cannot even
win a swimming match!

24:35.572 --> 24:37.813
Speaking only for myself here,

24:39.443 --> 24:43.747
not only do I doubt that you will be
able to stand for a moment

24:43.947 --> 24:45.249
against Grendel,

24:45.449 --> 24:50.695
I doubt that you will even have the belly
to stay in the hall all night.

24:54.859 --> 24:58.431
I find it difficult to argue with a drunk.

25:01.499 --> 25:05.640
But it's true, I did not win the race.

25:06.704 --> 25:10.942
We swam for five days, neck and neck.

25:11.142 --> 25:15.246
I was conserving my strength
for the final stretch

25:15.446 --> 25:18.249
when this storm blew up

25:19.017 --> 25:22.123
and with it came sea monsters.

25:35.901 --> 25:39.805
Again and again, the monsters attacked!

25:40.005 --> 25:43.411
Dark things from the sea's depths.

25:51.684 --> 25:56.855
I hacked and I lashed
at these foul beasts with my sword,

25:57.055 --> 25:59.460
spilling their guts into the sea.

26:10.069 --> 26:13.574
Beowulf!

26:20.814 --> 26:26.059
Then one of them seized me by its jaws

26:29.723 --> 26:31.964
and dragged me to the bottom.

26:58.486 --> 27:02.934
I killed the monster with my own blade

27:04.158 --> 27:07.332
and I plunged it into its heart.

27:09.664 --> 27:12.667
Yes, of course. The sea monsters.

27:13.868 --> 27:17.144
And you killed, what was it? 20?

27:19.073 --> 27:20.574
Nine.

27:21.575 --> 27:22.910
Last time it were three.

27:23.110 --> 27:26.989
But would you do me the honor
of telling me your name?

27:30.184 --> 27:33.756
I am Unferth, son of Ecglaf.

27:34.923 --> 27:38.233
Unferth, son of Ecglaf.

27:40.429 --> 27:41.999
I know who you are.

27:43.632 --> 27:46.668
They say you killed both your brothers

27:46.868 --> 27:50.747
when you witnessed them
having knowledge of your mother.

27:51.973 --> 27:56.144
I have another true thing to tell you,
Unferth Kinslayer.

27:56.344 --> 28:00.215
If your strength and heart
was as strong and fierce as your words,

28:00.415 --> 28:04.286
Grendel would not feel free to murder
and gorge on your people

28:04.486 --> 28:06.688
without fear of retaliation.

28:06.888 --> 28:08.891
Tonight will be different!

28:09.091 --> 28:14.006
Tonight, he will find Geats waiting
for him, not frightened sheep

28:19.902 --> 28:21.540
like you.

28:26.743 --> 28:28.153
Well done!

28:30.513 --> 28:35.251
That's the spirit, Beowulf.
That's the spirit we need.

28:35.451 --> 28:38.322
So you will kill my Grendel for me,
will you?

28:41.758 --> 28:47.469
Well, let's all drink in celebration
of the kill that is to come.

28:56.606 --> 29:00.811
Lips ripe as the berries in June

29:01.011 --> 29:04.715
Red the rose, red the rose

29:04.915 --> 29:09.286
Skin pale as the light of the moon

29:09.486 --> 29:12.892
Gently as she goes

29:13.657 --> 29:15.425
Eyes blue as the sea and the sky

29:15.625 --> 29:17.728
Beowulf. Come.

29:17.928 --> 29:19.797
Water flows, water flows

29:19.997 --> 29:22.065
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

29:22.265 --> 29:26.270
Heart burning like fire in the night

29:26.470 --> 29:29.876
Gently as she goes

29:34.745 --> 29:35.916
Come.

29:40.552 --> 29:41.758
There.

29:42.587 --> 29:44.691
The Royal Dragon Horn.

29:48.126 --> 29:50.629
It is beautiful.

29:50.829 --> 29:52.731
Isn't it magnificent?

29:52.931 --> 29:55.200
She's the prize of my treasure.

29:55.400 --> 30:00.471
I claimed her after my battle with Fafnir,
the dragon of the Northern moors.

30:00.671 --> 30:02.610
Nearly cost me my life.

30:03.441 --> 30:07.412
And there's a soft spot
under the throat, there.

30:07.612 --> 30:11.583
See? You have to go in
with a knife or a dagger.

30:15.553 --> 30:18.260
It's the only way you can kill a dragon.

30:19.591 --> 30:24.598
I wonder how many men
have died for love of her beauty.

30:25.831 --> 30:27.571
Can you blame them?

30:28.133 --> 30:31.136
If you destroy my Grendel for me,

30:32.104 --> 30:37.178
she'll be yours forever
and ever and ever.

30:39.178 --> 30:41.658
You do me great honor.

30:43.382 --> 30:45.384
It is we who are honored.

31:07.340 --> 31:08.575
Is that your demon?

31:08.775 --> 31:11.578
That was a wolf.
You don't hear Grendel when he comes.

31:11.778 --> 31:14.414
No? Well, you'll hear me, I promise.

31:14.614 --> 31:18.752
Come on, my mighty lust limb
can transport you to paradise,

31:18.952 --> 31:20.120
to ecstasy and back.

31:20.320 --> 31:23.290
No other man
will ever be able to satisfy you again.

31:23.490 --> 31:24.858
- Sorry.
- Come on!

31:25.058 --> 31:27.394
- I said no and I meant no.
- Why not?

31:27.594 --> 31:32.032
Because it's late and it's dark and the
monster could arrive at any moment!

31:32.232 --> 31:34.774
Well, then, how about a quick gobble?

31:40.173 --> 31:43.143
The hour is upon us.

31:43.343 --> 31:46.518
This old man needs his sleep.

31:47.214 --> 31:51.127
Where's my beautiful bedmate?
Come, my love.

31:53.621 --> 31:55.122
In a moment.

31:55.890 --> 31:59.235
Come, Wealthow,
let us pound the pillows.

32:00.027 --> 32:01.597
Don't touch me!

32:03.497 --> 32:05.601
That's the spirit, my girl.

32:06.367 --> 32:07.709
My Lord!

32:12.606 --> 32:17.263
Perhaps Her Majesty
could grace our ears

32:17.463 --> 32:22.120
with one more melody
before we all retire?

32:27.456 --> 32:29.435
It's the least I can do.

32:37.032 --> 32:41.173
Beowulf, I'll hope to see you
in the morning, Odin willing.

32:42.037 --> 32:46.144
And make sure
your thanes secure the doors.

32:47.642 --> 32:50.145
Good night. Good night.

32:52.514 --> 32:56.371
Good night, Beowulf.
Watch out for sea monsters.

32:56.571 --> 33:00.429
I'm sure your imagination
must be teeming with them.

33:08.330 --> 33:10.767
Just wait

33:10.967 --> 33:15.138
Though wide he may roam

33:15.338 --> 33:19.510
Always a hero comes home

33:23.246 --> 33:28.489
He goes where no one has gone

33:28.689 --> 33:33.933
But always a hero comes home

33:54.111 --> 34:00.068
He goes where no one has gone

34:00.268 --> 34:06.225
But always a hero comes home

34:11.895 --> 34:14.898
That was beautiful.

34:28.911 --> 34:31.358
You need to go now, Your Majesty.

34:32.183 --> 34:34.185
Of course. Grendel.

34:41.826 --> 34:44.280
The demon is my husband's shame.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.935
It's not a shame, it's a curse.

34:47.297 --> 34:49.505
No, shame.

34:50.735 --> 34:54.011
My husband has no other. No sons.

34:55.739 --> 34:57.909
And he will have no more,
for all his talk.

34:58.109 --> 35:01.079
Oy, Hondshew. How was she?

35:01.279 --> 35:02.985
Nah. Not my type.

35:03.185 --> 35:04.891
I know your type.

35:12.924 --> 35:15.371
Lord Beowulf, what are you doing?

35:16.328 --> 35:19.298
The creature has no sword, no armor.

35:19.498 --> 35:23.035
And I have no weapon
capable of slaying a monster.

35:23.235 --> 35:25.404
We shall fight as equals.

35:25.604 --> 35:27.440
And fate

35:29.575 --> 35:31.281
shall decide.

35:51.997 --> 35:54.568
Good. Tie it off with more chain.

35:58.305 --> 36:00.284
Enough frican' about!

36:10.050 --> 36:12.419
You're mad, you know that?

36:12.619 --> 36:13.829
Yes.

36:19.292 --> 36:22.363
Something vexes you, my Wiglaf?

36:25.198 --> 36:28.110
I don't like the smell of this one,
my Lord.

36:29.302 --> 36:31.304
The men are unprepared.

36:31.605 --> 36:33.675
They're distracted.

36:34.341 --> 36:36.710
Too many untended women here!

36:36.910 --> 36:39.721
Abstinence prior to battle is essential!

36:42.416 --> 36:46.120
A warrior's mind must be unblurred,
my Lord.

36:46.320 --> 36:47.929
Good night, Wiglaf.

36:52.593 --> 36:54.262
And while you're sleeping,
what're we meant to do?

36:54.462 --> 36:56.901
Sing! Loudly!

37:00.334 --> 37:04.038
Well, you heard him.
He wants us to sing. So sing!

37:04.238 --> 37:05.608
Olaf, sing!

37:10.344 --> 37:13.063
There was a dozen virgins

37:13.263 --> 37:15.783
Friesians, Danes and Franks

37:15.983 --> 37:19.955
We took them for some swifan
And all we got were wanks

37:20.155 --> 37:23.658
Oh, we are Beowulf's army
Each a mighty thane

37:23.858 --> 37:27.362
We'll pummel your asses
And ravage your lasses

37:27.562 --> 37:28.497
Then do it all over again

37:28.697 --> 37:32.050
The fattest of the virgins
I knew her for a whore

37:32.250 --> 37:35.578
I gave her all my codpiece
And still she wanted more

37:35.778 --> 37:38.907
Her sister was from Norway
She cost me 20 groats

37:39.107 --> 37:42.644
She showed me there was more ways
Than one to sow my oats

37:42.844 --> 37:46.201
Her mother was from Iceland
And she was mighty hot

37:46.401 --> 37:49.758
She'd need a whole damn iceberg
To cool her burning...

37:54.790 --> 37:57.463
Grendel. He knocks.

37:59.795 --> 38:03.233
That must be my sweet plum, Yrsa.

38:03.433 --> 38:04.567
She's ready for me
to taste her juicy fruit.

38:04.767 --> 38:05.602
My Lord.

38:08.538 --> 38:11.541
Patience, patience, my love.

38:14.377 --> 38:16.754
No! Hondshew! No!

38:28.224 --> 38:31.432
Swife me! It's the frican' monster!

40:24.977 --> 40:27.753
I swear, the bastard has no pintel!

41:08.855 --> 41:10.664
- No pintel.
- Aye.

41:32.780 --> 41:36.193
- The demon shrinks!
- It shrinks! It shrinks!

41:57.138 --> 42:00.175
Demon!

42:39.448 --> 42:43.623
Your bloodletting
days are finished, demon!

42:48.790 --> 42:51.065
It speaks. It speaks!

42:55.031 --> 43:00.103
I am ripper, tearer, slasher, gouger.

43:00.303 --> 43:04.307
I am the teeth in the darkness,
the talons in the night.

43:04.507 --> 43:07.777
Mine is strength and lust and power!

43:07.977 --> 43:10.018
I am Beowulf!

43:36.106 --> 43:37.710
Grendel's arm!

43:38.976 --> 43:40.477
You've done it!

43:42.780 --> 43:44.259
He's done it!

43:44.948 --> 43:48.896
He's torn the limbs from the beast!
Beowulf has killed him!

43:50.854 --> 43:59.831
- Hail, Beowulf!
- Hail, Beowulf!

44:01.799 --> 44:04.870
My Lord, Beowulf has killed the demon!

44:06.570 --> 44:08.413
Odin be praised.

44:09.907 --> 44:13.411
- Go tell the scops. Spread the word!
- Yes, my Lord.

44:16.781 --> 44:19.818
Tomorrow will be
a glorious day of rejoicing.

44:20.819 --> 44:22.798
Our nightmare is over.

44:25.490 --> 44:27.526
Come to bed, my sweet.

44:30.462 --> 44:35.233
My kingdom needs an heir!
I need a son! It's time you did your duty.

44:35.433 --> 44:38.908
How can I ever lay with you,
knowing you laid with her?

44:42.574 --> 44:44.815
I should never have told you.

44:47.112 --> 44:49.182
I should never have told you.

45:14.240 --> 45:16.447
My poor son.

45:25.751 --> 45:28.527
Sleep now, my son.

45:35.127 --> 45:37.368
Who murdered you, my son?

45:45.071 --> 45:48.780
He will pay, meen darling.

46:31.752 --> 46:33.458
Beowulf.

46:41.662 --> 46:44.199
They were great warriors.

46:46.601 --> 46:48.703
They died a foul death.

46:48.903 --> 46:53.608
They were murdered by a foul creature
from the depths of hell.

46:53.808 --> 46:57.214
The bards
will sing of their glory forever.

47:02.751 --> 47:06.088
Come, let us drink to their memory.

47:06.288 --> 47:09.658
I want you to raise the first cup.

47:09.858 --> 47:13.028
I am not in the mood for merrymaking.

47:13.228 --> 47:16.436
I'll ride down to the mooring,
prepare the boat.

47:18.300 --> 47:21.906
We still leave tomorrow, on the tide,
do we not?

47:23.839 --> 47:24.973
Aye.

47:25.173 --> 47:28.552
My thanes, my friends, brothers,

47:30.512 --> 47:35.358
this place for me
has been a hall of sadness.

47:36.451 --> 47:37.820
And for all of us,

47:38.020 --> 47:41.723
it has been a place of misery,
bloodshed, and death.

47:41.923 --> 47:45.695
But today,
the monster's reign has ended.

47:45.895 --> 47:49.999
They say he ripped the monster's
limb off with his bare hands.

47:50.199 --> 47:54.470
I wonder if Beowulf's strength is only
in his arms, or in his legs as well,

47:54.670 --> 47:56.381
all three of them?

47:57.440 --> 48:00.944
Well, after the feast tonight,
I'm sure you can find out, Gitte.

48:01.144 --> 48:04.380
Me? It's not me he wants, my Queen.

48:04.580 --> 48:05.881
Bring it here!

48:06.516 --> 48:08.325
Wealthow, my love,

48:09.652 --> 48:12.325
why don't you do the honors?

48:26.870 --> 48:28.542
For you, my Lord.

48:34.378 --> 48:36.790
Thank you, great King.

48:42.653 --> 48:44.257
And all of you,

48:47.291 --> 48:51.705
I wish you'd have been there last night
to see me kill the monster.

48:52.196 --> 48:54.665
I was asleep when he arrived.

48:54.865 --> 48:58.836
He ripped open the doors
with his bare hands.

48:59.036 --> 49:04.408
He stood 20 feet tall,
possessing the strength of 10 men.

49:04.608 --> 49:09.324
I looked at him and said,
"I am Beowulf!"

50:52.319 --> 50:53.889
Brave thane.

50:56.756 --> 50:58.291
My Queen.

51:08.969 --> 51:10.641
I love you.

51:11.571 --> 51:13.107
I want you, my King.

51:14.175 --> 51:15.585
Only you.

51:16.410 --> 51:19.789
<i>My hero, meen looviyend.</i>

51:21.048 --> 51:22.754
I don't understand.

51:24.185 --> 51:26.096
Where's your husband?

51:26.521 --> 51:27.795
Dead.

51:29.657 --> 51:30.794
Dead?

51:32.593 --> 51:34.504
This is a dream.

51:35.429 --> 51:38.900
This is not happening.
You're just a dream.

51:39.100 --> 51:41.880
Me, darling? A dream?

51:43.738 --> 51:49.119
Give me a child.
Enter me and give me a son!

52:23.145 --> 52:26.091
In the name of Odin!

52:27.683 --> 52:29.685
Is Grendel not dead?

52:30.886 --> 52:33.989
Has he grown his arm anew?

52:34.189 --> 52:36.226
It's not Grendel.

52:36.426 --> 52:39.062
Not Grendel? Then who?

52:39.262 --> 52:40.563
His mother.

52:41.864 --> 52:44.167
It's Grendel you killed.

52:44.367 --> 52:49.009
I had hoped his mother
had left the land long, long ago.

52:50.640 --> 52:53.313
How many monsters must I slay?

52:54.777 --> 52:57.814
Grendel's mother? Father?
Grendel's uncle?

52:58.014 --> 53:01.451
Must I hack down
a whole family tree of demons?

53:01.651 --> 53:02.885
She is the last of them.

53:03.085 --> 53:04.120
With her gone,

53:04.320 --> 53:07.991
demonkind will slip back
into the darkness from whence it came.

53:08.191 --> 53:09.392
Where it belongs.

53:09.592 --> 53:13.835
And the mother's mate?
Where is Grendel's father?

53:17.533 --> 53:20.514
Grendel's father
can do no harm to man.

53:24.875 --> 53:26.251
Beowulf,

53:27.177 --> 53:31.550
I was wrong to doubt you before,
and I shall not again.

53:31.750 --> 53:36.123
Yours is the blood of courage.
I beg your forgiveness.

53:38.722 --> 53:40.030
Granted.

53:40.624 --> 53:42.364
Cain! Cain!

53:52.636 --> 53:57.141
Take my sword.
It belonged to my father's father.

53:57.341 --> 53:59.310
It's called "Hrunting."

53:59.510 --> 54:03.151
That sword is no match
for demon magic.

54:04.516 --> 54:06.757
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

54:11.756 --> 54:16.295
No, I'm sorry I mentioned
you murdered your brothers.

54:17.228 --> 54:19.571
They were hasty words.

54:22.467 --> 54:26.312
Unferth, I may not return.

54:27.839 --> 54:31.252
Your ancestral sword
might be lost with me.

54:31.943 --> 54:35.754
As long as it is with you,
it will never be lost.

54:45.157 --> 54:47.864
And you, mighty Wiglaf,

54:50.763 --> 54:52.765
are you still with me?

54:55.234 --> 54:56.735
To the end.

55:24.898 --> 55:26.069
Look.

55:31.338 --> 55:34.041
She's probably a water demon.

55:34.241 --> 55:36.276
You don't want to meet her
in her element.

55:36.476 --> 55:37.584
I know.

55:38.945 --> 55:41.782
Do you want me to go in with you?

55:41.982 --> 55:43.317
Good.

55:43.517 --> 55:45.052
I'll be here.

57:55.018 --> 57:56.963
I see you've brought me treasure.

58:01.691 --> 58:03.500
Show yourself!

58:06.129 --> 58:07.630
What are you?

58:55.747 --> 58:58.625
Are you the one they call Beowulf?

59:18.403 --> 59:20.405
The Bee-Wolf.

59:22.173 --> 59:23.583
The bear.

59:35.921 --> 59:39.197
Such a strong man you are.

59:39.925 --> 59:42.530
With the strength of a king.

59:44.196 --> 59:47.472
The king you will one day become.

59:50.169 --> 59:54.140
What do you know of me, demon?

59:54.340 --> 59:58.611
I know that underneath your glamour

59:58.811 --> 01:00:03.123
you're as much a monster
as my son, Grendel.

01:00:05.384 --> 01:00:07.261
My glamour?

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:12.734
One needs glamour to become a king.

01:00:15.128 --> 01:00:20.771
A man like you could own
the greatest tale ever sung.

01:00:21.968 --> 01:00:24.738
Your story would live on

01:00:24.938 --> 01:00:30.615
when everything now alive is dust.

01:00:38.018 --> 01:00:39.360
Beowulf.

01:00:41.321 --> 01:00:44.491
It has been a long time

01:00:44.691 --> 01:00:47.467
since a man has come to visit me.

01:00:48.528 --> 01:00:51.099
I need no sword to kill you.

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:56.440
Of course you don't, my love.

01:00:58.973 --> 01:01:01.612
You took a son from me.

01:01:03.478 --> 01:01:06.481
Give me a son, brave thane.

01:01:08.883 --> 01:01:10.794
Stay with me.

01:01:12.019 --> 01:01:13.725
Love me.

01:01:15.923 --> 01:01:17.759
Love me

01:01:17.959 --> 01:01:24.239
and I shall weave you riches
beyond imagination.

01:01:25.633 --> 01:01:28.204
I shall make you

01:01:28.936 --> 01:01:32.679
the greatest king that ever lived.

01:01:40.849 --> 01:01:45.287
As long as you hold me in your heart

01:01:45.487 --> 01:01:51.027
and this golden horn
remains in my keeping,

01:01:52.427 --> 01:01:54.964
you will forever be king.

01:01:57.633 --> 01:01:59.510
Forever strong,

01:02:00.736 --> 01:02:02.374
mighty

01:02:03.105 --> 01:02:05.209
and all powerful.

01:02:06.842 --> 01:02:10.050
This I promise.

01:02:14.716 --> 01:02:19.426
This I swear.

01:02:39.142 --> 01:02:40.621
My Lord.

01:02:42.512 --> 01:02:44.547
It's dead, my Lady.

01:02:44.747 --> 01:02:49.619
When I finished off
Grendel's monstrous mother,

01:02:49.819 --> 01:02:51.723
I severed the brute's head.

01:02:52.922 --> 01:02:54.696
Our curse is lifted.

01:02:55.425 --> 01:02:58.695
Our curse is lifted. Odin be praised!

01:02:58.895 --> 01:03:00.640
Beowulf be praised!

01:03:01.631 --> 01:03:03.611
Our curse is lifted.

01:03:05.269 --> 01:03:08.306
Take this out of my sight. Unferth!

01:03:08.839 --> 01:03:11.342
Into the sea, quickly.

01:03:14.345 --> 01:03:18.315
I plunged Hrunting
into Grendel's mother's chest

01:03:18.515 --> 01:03:22.486
and when I pulled the sword
free from her corpse,

01:03:22.686 --> 01:03:24.855
the creature sprang back to life,

01:03:25.055 --> 01:03:29.662
so I plunged the sword back into
the hag's chest and there it will stay.

01:03:30.961 --> 01:03:32.906
Till Ragnarok, huh?

01:03:36.333 --> 01:03:40.178
And our people shall be grateful
till the Ragnarok.

01:03:46.311 --> 01:03:48.580
More mead, my Lord?

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:49.751
Aye.

01:03:51.149 --> 01:03:55.427
And the drinking horn, do you have it?

01:03:56.154 --> 01:03:57.325
No.

01:03:58.757 --> 01:04:03.728
I knew the greedy witch desired it,
so I threw it into the swamp.

01:04:03.928 --> 01:04:06.164
And when she followed,
that's where I struck,

01:04:06.364 --> 01:04:08.667
with the mighty sword Hrunting.

01:04:10.235 --> 01:04:14.148
When she was dead, I looked for it,
but it was gone forever.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.115
Then find our hero another cup,
my love.

01:04:20.979 --> 01:04:24.221
First, the hero and I must talk.

01:04:25.818 --> 01:04:27.194
Beowulf.

01:04:35.161 --> 01:04:38.073
So you brought back
the head of Grendel.

01:04:38.898 --> 01:04:41.435
What about the head of the mother?

01:04:42.368 --> 01:04:45.071
With her dead and cold in the bog,

01:04:45.271 --> 01:04:48.775
is it not enough
to return one monster's head?

01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:51.981
Did you kill her?

01:04:52.745 --> 01:04:57.352
Would you like to hear the story of my
struggle against this monstrous hag?

01:04:59.118 --> 01:05:03.066
She's no hag, Beowulf.
We both know that.

01:05:04.056 --> 01:05:08.198
But answer me, did you kill her?

01:05:14.401 --> 01:05:18.576
Would I have been able to escape her,
had I not?

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.786
Grendel is dead.
That's all that matters to me.

01:05:30.317 --> 01:05:32.490
He can bother me no more.

01:05:33.253 --> 01:05:38.361
The mother, "the hag,"
she's not my curse.

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.764
Not anymore.

01:05:43.296 --> 01:05:44.866
Not anymore.

01:05:47.334 --> 01:05:50.946
Listen to me!

01:05:53.975 --> 01:05:58.429
Because my Lord Beowulf
is a mighty hero

01:05:58.629 --> 01:06:03.084
and because
he killed the demon Grendel

01:06:03.284 --> 01:06:05.786
and laid its mother in her grave...

01:06:05.986 --> 01:06:08.489
- To Beowulf!
- Long live Beowulf!

01:06:08.689 --> 01:06:11.663
...and because I have no heir,

01:06:13.628 --> 01:06:15.664
I have no sons,

01:06:17.498 --> 01:06:20.552
I declare that on my death,

01:06:20.752 --> 01:06:23.807
all that I possess, my kingdom,

01:06:24.772 --> 01:06:27.912
my hall of sadness and shame,

01:06:28.876 --> 01:06:32.381
and even my lovely young Queen,

01:06:34.583 --> 01:06:36.084
my Wealthow,

01:06:39.588 --> 01:06:42.591
everything, everything

01:06:46.695 --> 01:06:50.666
I leave to this, our hero.

01:06:50.866 --> 01:06:53.209
- But, my Lord...
- I have spoken!

01:06:56.071 --> 01:06:57.572
I have spoken!

01:07:01.543 --> 01:07:03.412
When I am gone,

01:07:03.612 --> 01:07:08.151
Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow,
shall be king!

01:07:17.994 --> 01:07:19.404
Beowulf!

01:07:24.033 --> 01:07:25.568
My Lord.

01:07:27.036 --> 01:07:29.482
Everything in its time, Beowulf.

01:07:43.853 --> 01:07:45.491
Hrothgar!

01:07:51.961 --> 01:07:53.736
He must have fallen.

01:08:25.095 --> 01:08:30.033
- All hail King Beowulf.
- All hail King Beowulf.

01:08:30.234 --> 01:08:32.377
All hail King Beowulf.

01:08:35.339 --> 01:08:37.080
King Beowulf.

01:09:12.243 --> 01:09:13.933
Archers.

01:09:14.133 --> 01:09:15.822
Archers!

01:09:46.712 --> 01:09:49.715
This is not battle, Wiglaf.

01:09:49.915 --> 01:09:51.558
This is slaughter.

01:09:53.586 --> 01:09:57.023
The Frisians want to make
themselves heroes, my Lord.

01:09:57.223 --> 01:09:59.326
They want the bards
to sing of their deeds.

01:09:59.526 --> 01:10:01.461
It's going to be a short song.

01:10:01.661 --> 01:10:02.796
Now, can you blame them?

01:10:02.996 --> 01:10:04.631
Your legend is known
from the high seas

01:10:04.831 --> 01:10:07.167
and the snow barriers
to the great island kingdom.

01:10:07.367 --> 01:10:09.391
You are the monster slayer.

01:10:09.591 --> 01:10:11.615
We men are the monsters now.

01:10:13.607 --> 01:10:16.451
The time of heroes is dead, Wiglaf.

01:10:17.477 --> 01:10:19.713
The Christ God has killed it,

01:10:19.913 --> 01:10:25.052
leaving humankind with nothing
but weeping martyrs,

01:10:25.252 --> 01:10:27.721
fear and shame.

01:10:27.921 --> 01:10:31.891
Show me to Beowulf!
Show me to King Beowulf!

01:10:32.626 --> 01:10:34.928
Come on, Frisian. Speak up!

01:10:35.128 --> 01:10:36.429
Leave him!

01:10:37.230 --> 01:10:40.568
You think it sport
to mock your opponents in this fashion?

01:10:40.768 --> 01:10:44.038
Let him die quickly,
with some honor still intact.

01:10:44.238 --> 01:10:45.812
Coward!

01:10:46.474 --> 01:10:48.409
Kill me yourself!

01:10:48.609 --> 01:10:52.080
Balls! The king
must never engage in direct battle.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.483
Kill the invader now! Do it quickly!
Put his head on a spear.

01:10:55.683 --> 01:10:56.654
Stop!

01:11:06.961 --> 01:11:10.374
My Lord, the king
must not engage in direct battle.

01:11:13.334 --> 01:11:14.813
Let him up.

01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:22.583
You want your name
in the Song of Beowulf?

01:11:24.046 --> 01:11:29.427
You think it should end with me killed
by some Frisian raider with no name?

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:37.226
I'm Finn of Frisia

01:11:37.426 --> 01:11:40.662
and my name
shall be remembered forever.

01:11:40.862 --> 01:11:42.732
Only if you kill me!

01:11:44.366 --> 01:11:46.709
Otherwise, you're nothing.

01:11:47.569 --> 01:11:50.672
You think you're the
first to try to kill me,

01:11:50.872 --> 01:11:52.142
or the hundredth?

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:56.712
Well, let me tell you something, Frisian.

01:11:56.912 --> 01:12:00.216
The gods will not allow my death
by your feeble blade.

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:05.088
The gods will not allow me to die
by a sword, or be taken by the sea.

01:12:05.288 --> 01:12:09.434
The gods will not let me
pass in my sleep, ripe with age!

01:12:12.429 --> 01:12:16.699
Plant your ax here, Finn of Frisia.
Take my life.

01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:19.805
Someone give him a sword, or I'll...

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:23.741
You'll what? Kill me?

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:29.054
Well, kill me! Do it! Kill me! Kill me!

01:12:46.297 --> 01:12:49.368
You know why you can't kill me,
my friend?

01:12:51.235 --> 01:12:55.877
'Cause I died many, many years ago
when I was young.

01:13:02.046 --> 01:13:04.782
Give him a gold piece
and send him home.

01:13:04.982 --> 01:13:06.886
He has a story to tell.

01:13:36.014 --> 01:13:37.549
Your Majesty?

01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:39.851
Are you hurt?

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.055
Not a scratch.

01:13:50.328 --> 01:13:52.398
So beautiful.

01:13:53.765 --> 01:13:55.574
And so young.

01:13:56.201 --> 01:13:59.037
You know, Ursula, when I was young,

01:13:59.237 --> 01:14:03.375
I used to think being a king
was about battling every morning

01:14:03.575 --> 01:14:06.044
and counting the gold
and loot in the afternoon

01:14:06.244 --> 01:14:09.287
and swiving beautiful women
every evening.

01:14:10.883 --> 01:14:15.798
But now, well, nothing is as good
as it should have been.

01:14:16.989 --> 01:14:21.460
Not even the "swiving a beautiful woman
every night" part, Your Majesty?

01:14:24.397 --> 01:14:27.139
Well, some nights, Ursula, some nights.

01:14:28.334 --> 01:14:30.002
Perhaps tonight?

01:14:30.202 --> 01:14:33.327
No, tonight, I feel my age upon me.

01:14:33.527 --> 01:14:36.652
Tomorrow, after the celebrations.

01:14:37.176 --> 01:14:40.646
We can't forget what tomorrow is,
can we now?

01:14:40.846 --> 01:14:44.000
Your day.
When the Song of Beowulf is told

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:47.354
of how you lifted the darkness
from the land.

01:14:48.487 --> 01:14:52.959
And the day after,
we celebrate the birth of Hallend Christ.

01:14:58.332 --> 01:15:00.812
I see you've survived.

01:15:04.605 --> 01:15:06.516
Alas, my Queen,

01:15:07.507 --> 01:15:11.278
the Frisian invaders
have been pushed into the sea.

01:15:11.478 --> 01:15:13.647
You are not a widow,

01:15:13.847 --> 01:15:14.682
yet.

01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:20.259
How comforting, my husband.

01:15:22.556 --> 01:15:26.128
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!

01:16:30.959 --> 01:16:32.460
Unferth.

01:16:33.262 --> 01:16:36.398
You're not celebrating
your King's glory tonight?

01:16:36.598 --> 01:16:38.639
I have something for the King.

01:16:39.435 --> 01:16:40.736
What is it?

01:16:40.936 --> 01:16:43.972
I said I have something for the King.

01:16:44.172 --> 01:16:46.327
- Show it to me.
- I will not.

01:16:46.527 --> 01:16:48.682
You will show it to me first.

01:16:48.977 --> 01:16:50.713
Bollocks, Wiglaf.

01:16:50.913 --> 01:16:53.716
I'll show it first to Beowulf.
The King needs to see it.

01:16:53.916 --> 01:16:55.092
The King

01:16:56.152 --> 01:16:57.961
needs to see what?

01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:09.733
Lost and now found.

01:17:19.008 --> 01:17:21.454
A gift fit for a king.

01:17:25.181 --> 01:17:27.183
Do you recognize it?

01:17:30.987 --> 01:17:33.356
Where did you find this?

01:17:33.556 --> 01:17:38.829
On the moors. My slave Cain found it
on the barren hill where nothing grows.

01:17:39.029 --> 01:17:42.469
I beat him for treading near
such an unholy place.

01:17:44.001 --> 01:17:45.445
My Lord,

01:17:47.204 --> 01:17:48.705
isn't this...

01:18:01.852 --> 01:18:03.695
So, Lord Beowulf,

01:18:09.827 --> 01:18:14.503
it's come back to you,
after all these years.

01:18:16.534 --> 01:18:19.304
My Lord, this is the slave who found it.

01:18:19.504 --> 01:18:22.057
Please, please don't kill me!

01:18:22.257 --> 01:18:24.610
Where did you find this treasure?

01:18:24.810 --> 01:18:27.813
I'm sorry I ran away, Master.
But please don't hurt me no more.

01:18:28.013 --> 01:18:29.758
- Answer your King!
- Stop!

01:18:30.816 --> 01:18:32.090
Stop.

01:18:39.157 --> 01:18:40.328
Where?

01:18:41.259 --> 01:18:44.001
Up, up on the moors.

01:18:45.497 --> 01:18:48.773
But I was gonna bring it back, Master.
I swear.

01:18:50.168 --> 01:18:51.612
Is that all?

01:18:53.305 --> 01:18:55.910
No demon? No witch?

01:18:58.677 --> 01:19:00.019
No woman?

01:19:11.357 --> 01:19:15.328
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!

01:19:15.528 --> 01:19:27.143
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!
Hail, Beowulf!

01:19:31.811 --> 01:19:36.415
Look at you. You're nothing,

01:19:36.615 --> 01:19:39.218
an empty nothing.

01:19:39.418 --> 01:19:41.171
Come forth!

01:19:41.371 --> 01:19:43.124
Show yourself!

01:19:45.626 --> 01:19:48.572
Even with all your riches,

01:19:49.596 --> 01:19:53.339
your kingdom, your power, your glory

01:19:54.201 --> 01:19:56.681
and your women.

01:19:59.506 --> 01:20:03.818
Which one do you think
I should kill first,

01:20:04.878 --> 01:20:08.315
your pretty little bedwarmer,

01:20:08.515 --> 01:20:11.091
or your wise Queen?

01:20:13.754 --> 01:20:15.358
What are you?

01:20:19.459 --> 01:20:21.962
I'm something you left behind,

01:20:23.597 --> 01:20:24.599
Father!

01:20:49.924 --> 01:20:51.960
Another restless night?

01:20:57.999 --> 01:20:59.842
It's all right, girl.

01:21:00.702 --> 01:21:02.704
I'm not going to eat you.

01:21:11.246 --> 01:21:13.419
He has bad dreams.

01:21:14.450 --> 01:21:16.793
They've been coming more often.

01:21:17.987 --> 01:21:21.434
He's a king, and kings
have a lot on their conscience.

01:21:28.630 --> 01:21:31.133
He calls your name in his sleep.

01:21:33.168 --> 01:21:34.647
Does he?

01:21:40.542 --> 01:21:44.353
I believe he still holds you in his heart.

01:21:46.215 --> 01:21:47.523
Do you?

01:21:51.121 --> 01:21:53.123
I often wonder

01:21:55.458 --> 01:21:57.060
what happened.

01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:58.539
To us?

01:22:04.367 --> 01:22:06.244
Too many secrets.

01:22:12.842 --> 01:22:14.821
God, help us.

01:22:42.073 --> 01:22:45.247
What? What do you want of me?

01:22:46.744 --> 01:22:51.056
I have a message for my father.

01:22:52.083 --> 01:22:54.426
Tell me! What did this?

01:22:54.552 --> 01:22:58.989
I saw our whole village burn.
Children screaming as they died!

01:22:59.189 --> 01:23:02.059
I saw it, Your Majesty,
vomiting fire and smoke!

01:23:02.259 --> 01:23:04.061
Damn you! What was it?

01:23:04.261 --> 01:23:05.540
A dragon!

01:23:06.764 --> 01:23:09.107
- It's Unferth, my Lord!
- Unferth.

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:12.679
You say a dragon did this? Stop!

01:23:15.474 --> 01:23:18.318
You had an agreement.

01:23:18.777 --> 01:23:21.046
You would not be harmed.

01:23:21.246 --> 01:23:24.282
But now the golden horn
has returned to you.

01:23:24.482 --> 01:23:26.651
The agreement is ended.

01:23:26.851 --> 01:23:28.820
Who? Who said that?

01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:31.363
"The sins of the fathers!"

01:23:32.324 --> 01:23:35.294
That's the last thing I heard.

01:23:35.494 --> 01:23:39.998
The last thing before
my family was burned alive!

01:23:40.198 --> 01:23:42.774
The sins of the fathers!

01:23:44.136 --> 01:23:47.139
Sins of the fathers!

01:23:47.839 --> 01:23:50.376
The sins of the fathers!

01:23:51.710 --> 01:23:54.487
The sins of the fathers!

01:24:00.453 --> 01:24:04.190
Take up your positions along
the northern edge of the great gorge.

01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:07.059
It is our only hope if I fail.

01:24:07.259 --> 01:24:08.401
My Lord.

01:24:12.131 --> 01:24:14.000
Don't go, I beg you!

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:16.646
You are free. I release you.

01:24:17.937 --> 01:24:22.041
Find a good man and bear him children.
But bear him a son.

01:24:22.241 --> 01:24:24.376
I don't want anyone else. I want you.

01:24:24.576 --> 01:24:26.512
I am not the man you think me to be!

01:24:26.712 --> 01:24:31.117
You're a great man! And a hero!
This I know to be true.

01:24:31.317 --> 01:24:34.063
Then you are as foolish
as the rest of them!

01:24:48.035 --> 01:24:50.070
Very impressive, dear.

01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:53.740
But the armor suited you better
when you were younger.

01:24:55.209 --> 01:24:56.915
I'm sure it did.

01:25:01.848 --> 01:25:04.284
Why don't you take that poor girl

01:25:04.484 --> 01:25:07.888
and live out your remaining years
in peace?

01:25:08.088 --> 01:25:10.561
Let some young hero save us.

01:25:10.924 --> 01:25:12.095
What?

01:25:12.626 --> 01:25:16.267
And let the nightmare
start all over again?

01:25:17.832 --> 01:25:21.780
No. I visited this horror
upon my kingdom.

01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:26.112
- I must be the one to finish her.
- Her.

01:25:30.278 --> 01:25:32.655
Was she so beautiful, Beowulf?

01:25:34.716 --> 01:25:36.593
A beauty so costly?

01:25:42.857 --> 01:25:46.930
Beautiful, and full of fine promises.

01:25:51.799 --> 01:25:53.505
I was weak.

01:25:56.337 --> 01:25:57.941
I am sorry.

01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:03.249
So, so sorry.

01:26:08.217 --> 01:26:11.095
I have always loved you, my Queen.

01:26:13.822 --> 01:26:15.323
And I you.

01:26:25.934 --> 01:26:27.845
Keep a memory of me,

01:26:28.904 --> 01:26:31.543
not as a king or a hero,

01:26:33.208 --> 01:26:34.743
but as a man,

01:26:36.111 --> 01:26:38.056
fallible and flawed.

01:26:55.265 --> 01:26:57.134
This is the place.

01:26:57.334 --> 01:26:59.939
Where you slayed Grendel's mother.

01:27:03.807 --> 01:27:06.651
Wiglaf, I have no sons,

01:27:07.677 --> 01:27:12.148
and if this demon kills me,
I have arranged with the heralds

01:27:12.348 --> 01:27:13.383
that you shall be king.

01:27:13.583 --> 01:27:16.154
Don't speak of such things, my Lord.

01:27:19.689 --> 01:27:23.194
Great friend,
there is something you should know.

01:27:23.394 --> 01:27:25.863
Nay! There is nothing I should know.

01:27:26.063 --> 01:27:29.400
You are Beowulf.
Beowulf the mighty, the hero!

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.802
The slayer and destroyer of demons!

01:27:32.002 --> 01:27:34.538
Now, let us kill this flying devil
where it sleeps

01:27:34.738 --> 01:27:36.915
and get on with our bloody lives!

01:27:42.213 --> 01:27:44.920
- Do you want me to go in with you?
- No.

01:27:46.784 --> 01:27:48.058
Good.

01:28:34.533 --> 01:28:36.012
Beowulf.

01:28:37.068 --> 01:28:39.673
It has been a long time.

01:28:46.779 --> 01:28:51.523
Take your damned horn
and leave my land in peace.

01:28:54.987 --> 01:28:57.330
Too late, my love.

01:29:18.578 --> 01:29:20.557
Odin's swifan balls!

01:29:29.423 --> 01:29:31.368
It's heading for Herot!

01:30:34.856 --> 01:30:36.460
Now!

01:30:45.266 --> 01:30:46.836
Hrothgar.

01:31:57.607 --> 01:32:00.644
Come on, come on!
Come on! Come on!

01:32:12.288 --> 01:32:13.597
Damn you!

01:32:20.097 --> 01:32:23.544
I'll have your lizard head on a spike!

01:34:34.101 --> 01:34:35.807
No!

01:36:30.186 --> 01:36:31.596
My Lord!

01:37:00.917 --> 01:37:05.058
No!

01:38:36.282 --> 01:38:38.751
Over here! Attend the Queen.

01:38:38.951 --> 01:38:41.158
- Attend the Queen.
- Attend the Queen.

01:40:23.958 --> 01:40:26.904
I told you we were too old to be heroes.

01:40:28.563 --> 01:40:30.582
Let's get you to a healer.

01:40:30.782 --> 01:40:32.801
Not this time, old friend.

01:40:33.468 --> 01:40:35.604
You are Beowulf.

01:40:35.804 --> 01:40:39.308
A little thing like this
isn't going to finish you off.

01:40:40.042 --> 01:40:42.749
Do you hear her?

01:40:45.648 --> 01:40:47.422
I hear nothing.

01:40:48.684 --> 01:40:51.587
Grendel's mother,
my son's mother, my...

01:40:51.787 --> 01:40:53.189
- No, my Lord.
- My...

01:40:53.389 --> 01:40:56.768
You killed Grendel's mother
when we were young.

01:40:58.194 --> 01:40:59.832
They sing of it.

01:41:01.530 --> 01:41:04.010
Too late for lies, Wiglaf.

01:41:06.335 --> 01:41:07.814
Too late.

01:42:15.106 --> 01:42:16.550
He was

01:42:17.975 --> 01:42:20.114
the bravest of us.

01:42:24.288 --> 01:42:26.248
He was the prince

01:42:28.375 --> 01:42:30.127
of all warriors.

01:42:33.796 --> 01:42:36.299
His name will live forever.

01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:50.188
His song shall be sung forever.
