I've seen death,
I've seen...

00:11.970 --> 00:14.514
my friends,
my men being killed.

00:15.932 --> 00:17.559
And, uh...

00:18.685 --> 00:20.478
This is...

00:20.562 --> 00:22.772
It doesn't take
too many days of that

00:22.856 --> 00:24.816
and you change
dramatically.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.943
We was hungry,
we had no food.

00:27.026 --> 00:28.194
We didn't have
much ammunition.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.863
It was cold.
We didn't have any clothes.

00:29.946 --> 00:31.740
You couldn't
build a fire.

00:31.823 --> 00:33.908
If you built fire,
some crazy thing
would shoot at ya.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.453
Everywhere you would look,
you would see dead people.

00:36.536 --> 00:39.956
A dead soldier there, here,
ours, theirs.

00:40.957 --> 00:43.334
Then civilians besides.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.588
Dead animals.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.299
So, death
was all over.

00:49.382 --> 00:53.595
You don't have a chance
when your friends go down

00:53.678 --> 00:55.722
to-- to really...

00:57.223 --> 01:00.143
take care of 'em
as you might.

01:00.226 --> 01:04.105
And especially if you're under
attack, moving, or whatever.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.111
I withstood it well,

01:10.195 --> 01:14.532
but I had a lot
of trouble in later life...

01:16.534 --> 01:19.287
because... those events

01:19.370 --> 01:22.415
would come back and...

01:23.333 --> 01:24.793
and you never forget 'em.

06:43.694 --> 06:45.988
Which I do.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.407
Hell, Shifty, I think maybe
I could have even given you

a run for
your money, right?

06:49.534 --> 06:51.452
No, no, I'm not
a good shot.

Now, Dad, he was
an excellent shot.

06:53.579 --> 06:56.207
Excellent, I declare,
he'd shoot the wings
off a fly.

Hey, Lip, that German,
what'd you think he was doing?

06:59.168 --> 07:00.503
Probably
a little recon.

07:00.586 --> 07:03.256
He must have figured
nobody would hear a horse.

07:03.339 --> 07:06.509
I think he was just trying
to get the hell out of Dodge.

07:03.339 --> 07:06.509
Yeah.

07:06.592 --> 07:07.802
What happened
to the horse?

07:07.885 --> 07:09.554
I don't know,
probably still running.

07:09.637 --> 07:11.806
Hope he's okay.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.767
You dug in?

07:12.765 --> 07:14.767
Yeah, yeah.

07:14.851 --> 07:18.062
Yeah, just thought I'd take
a walk, shoot the shit.

Well, you're
a good shot, Hoob.

Could you be a little more

07:46.632 --> 07:47.592
Not really, sir.

07:47.675 --> 07:49.218
Godammit, I haven't
seen him all day.

I didn't see him when we were
coming through the woods,

07:51.345 --> 07:52.847
and I have to figure out
how we ended up.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.140
Well, two wounded.

07:54.223 --> 07:57.977
Who?

07:54.223 --> 07:57.977
Brown and Stevenson.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.145
Godammit.

07:59.228 --> 08:01.189
And where's Dike?
Where the hell is he?

08:01.272 --> 08:02.523
Where the hell
does he ever go?

08:02.607 --> 08:04.233
I don't know, but I wish
he'd stay the hell there.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.152
It'd be nice if he took
Lieutenant Shames with him.

08:06.235 --> 08:07.278
Shut up, boys.

08:07.361 --> 08:08.613
Shutting up, Sarge.

the hell is that?

08:13.534 --> 08:15.578

08:13.534 --> 08:15.578
Lipton: No, we would
have heard.

08:17.121 --> 08:18.789
Compton:
One man,
maybe a sniper.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.458

08:22.376 --> 08:24.086
Nobody out there.

Shifty: Uh-huh.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.590

it's Hoob, he's shot.

08:27.673 --> 08:31.302
Sniper?

08:27.673 --> 08:31.302
No, no,
he shot himself.

08:31.385 --> 08:32.762
Stupid, stupid.

08:31.385 --> 08:32.762
Medic!

08:32.845 --> 08:35.389
What happened?

08:32.845 --> 08:35.389
Doc.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.099
Is he all right?

08:35.473 --> 08:37.099
It's my fucking leg.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.392
He'll be all right.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.392
He did what?

08:38.476 --> 08:39.769
It just went off.

08:38.476 --> 08:39.769
What happened?

08:39.852 --> 08:41.354
It just went off.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.354
What the hell are you doing

08:41.437 --> 08:42.563
with a loaded gun
in your pants?

08:42.647 --> 08:44.440
Shit, Buck, I wasn't
touching it or nothing.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.983
Godammit,
godammit.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.027
I wasn't touching it,
I swear.

08:48.110 --> 08:49.904
Medic!

08:48.110 --> 08:49.904
Where are
you hit, Hoob?

08:49.987 --> 08:51.572
Hoob, where are you hit?

08:49.987 --> 08:51.572
In my leg.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.282
Okay, hold on,
Hoob, hold on.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.076
Stay calm.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.076
Now, don't look, Hoob.

08:55.159 --> 08:56.744
It's gonna be fine.
Don't worry about it.
Come on.

08:56.827 --> 08:59.121
It's all right.

08:56.827 --> 08:59.121
It hurts like
a son of a bitch.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.165
You'll be okay.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.165
I think maybe
I hit bone.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.333
Doc!

09:03.334 --> 09:05.002
Don't worry
about it, Hoob.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.837
Warm him up,
warm him up.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.423
Can you hear me, Hoob?

09:06.921 --> 09:09.423
Somebody keep
him warm.

09:09.507 --> 09:10.800
Sergeant.

09:09.507 --> 09:10.800
Keep him warm.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.635
Sergeant, let me
see it, huh?

09:12.718 --> 09:14.262
(grunting)

09:12.718 --> 09:14.262
Hang in there.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.639
Can we get him--
warm up some blankets
or something for him?

09:16.722 --> 09:17.807
You're gonna
be fine.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.809
Talk to him, Hashey.
Keep talking to him.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.894
Okay, Hoob,
listen to me, Hoob.
It's okay.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.021

a German leg, Hoob?

09:24.105 --> 09:25.648

09:24.105 --> 09:25.648
(chattering)

09:27.692 --> 09:29.277
You're gonna be fine.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.277
Hold on, Hoob,
hold on.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.987
Perconte, put
this across him.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.697
Wrap him up,
wrap him up.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.950
Hang in there, Hoob.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.950
Come on, come on.

09:36.033 --> 09:39.120
Hey, Lip.
You said I was
a great shot, right?

09:39.203 --> 09:42.415
You are, man.
You're a great shot.
You're a great shot.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.208
Come on, Hoob,
you jump out of planes.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.835
You're tough, man.
Come on.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.835
He's still shivering.

09:45.918 --> 09:48.004
It's not that
bad at all, come on.

09:45.918 --> 09:48.004
Stay with us, Hoob.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.006
Hoob, take it easy.
It's all right.
Don't worry.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.424
Doc, what are we gonna do?

09:51.507 --> 09:53.259
How are we doing, doc?

09:51.507 --> 09:53.259
Okay, you're
gonna be fine.

09:53.342 --> 09:55.428
I can't see a thing.
We've gotta get him back
to an aid station.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.763
Hold on tight.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.763
All right, right, let's get
ready to move him.

09:57.847 --> 10:01.392
Take it easy.

09:57.847 --> 10:01.392
Stay there, Hoob.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.811
I can't see anything,
we're gonna need to--

10:01.475 --> 10:03.811
Doc. Doc!

10:12.570 --> 10:13.779
Jesus.

10:16.532 --> 10:17.950
Perco, I need a jeep.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.000
Lipton:
<i>He was wearing</i>
<i>so many clothes,</i>

10:26.083 --> 10:27.501
<i>we couldn't tell</i>
<i>how bad he was bleeding.</i>

10:27.585 --> 10:29.545
By the time we got him
to the aid station,

10:29.628 --> 10:30.671
he was already dead.

10:30.755 --> 10:34.383
The bullet cut the main artery
in his leg, sir.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.553
Oh hell, Lip.

10:37.636 --> 10:40.222
It wouldn't have made
a difference if you had known.

10:40.306 --> 10:43.392
Cut that main artery
in the leg, that's--
that's it.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.518
Yes, sir.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.646
Well, I'm gonna go back
and make sure the boys

10:47.730 --> 10:48.856
are all dug in, sir.

10:50.107 --> 10:51.150
Lip.

10:52.443 --> 10:53.861
Where's Dike?

10:54.779 --> 10:56.322
You wanna
see him, sir?

10:56.405 --> 10:57.865
No, I just would
have expected to get

10:57.948 --> 10:59.325
this kind of news
from him.

11:00.576 --> 11:02.286
Well, I was--
I was there, sir.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.413
Oh.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.413
I figured it might
as well be me.

11:16.842 --> 11:17.760
(man chattering)

11:17.843 --> 11:19.553
Lipton:
<i>"Where's Dike?"</i>

11:19.637 --> 11:22.014
<i>I probably heard</i>
<i>that question 1,000 times.</i>

11:22.098 --> 11:25.851
<i>I probably asked it</i>
<i>a few times myself.</i>

11:25.935 --> 11:27.937
<i>There were long stretches</i>
<i>where we didn't know</i>

11:28.020 --> 11:29.355
<i>where Lieutenant Dike was.</i>

11:29.438 --> 11:33.234
<i>He'd disappear,</i>
<i>go off on these walks</i>
<i>for hours at a time.</i>

11:33.317 --> 11:35.361
<i>Wouldn't have been so bad</i>
<i>if he was just one of the guys</i>

11:35.444 --> 11:37.488
<i>in the company,</i>
<i>but Lieutenant Dike</i>

11:37.571 --> 11:39.198
<i>was supposed to be</i>
<i>leading the company.</i>

11:39.281 --> 11:41.409
Right. Patrols are
gonna cover...

11:41.492 --> 11:44.370
Lipton:
<i>Captain Winters was a C.O.</i>
<i>we could all respect.</i>

11:45.621 --> 11:47.748
<i>Moose Heyliger probably</i>
<i>would have done a good job,</i>

11:47.832 --> 11:49.667
<i>but before we got</i>
<i>a chance to find out,</i>

11:49.750 --> 11:51.669
<i>he was accidentally shot</i>
<i>by a sentry.</i>

11:52.711 --> 11:54.505
<i>Then came</i>
<i>Norman Dike.</i>

11:54.588 --> 11:57.091
And I want tight security
around the company C.P.,

11:57.174 --> 11:58.634
Lieutenant Shames,
that understood?

11:58.717 --> 12:01.637
Lipton:
<i>Dike wasn't a bad leader</i>
<i>because he made bad decisions.</i>

12:01.721 --> 12:04.306
<i>He was a bad leader</i>
<i>because he made no decisions.</i>

12:05.391 --> 12:09.395
Now, Battalion S-3
is planning a move.

12:09.478 --> 12:12.106
So, I will probably
be called away...

12:12.189 --> 12:13.524
regularly.

12:13.607 --> 12:15.025
Are there
any questions?

12:15.109 --> 12:16.193
Er, yeah.

12:16.277 --> 12:19.572
Um, what's the formation
you want us to go for?

12:21.240 --> 12:24.368
At present, as per usual,
but I'll clarify that with you

12:24.452 --> 12:27.288
at a later time,
Lieutenant Compton.

12:27.371 --> 12:28.456
Yes, sir.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.461
All right, I gotta
make a call.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.094
(men chattering)

12:42.178 --> 12:43.929
Let's move it out.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.929
Right.

12:48.350 --> 12:51.312
Lipton:
<i>Dike was the favorite</i>
<i>of somebody at division.</i>

12:51.395 --> 12:52.771
<i>He'd been sent down</i>
<i>to "E" Company</i>

12:52.855 --> 12:54.565
<i>to get some</i>
<i>combat experience.</i>

12:55.566 --> 12:57.318
<i>Sometimes we got</i>
<i>the feeling "E" Company</i>

12:57.401 --> 12:59.069
<i>was an annoyance</i>
<i>to him,</i>

12:59.153 --> 13:00.654
<i>something unpleasant</i>
<i>he had to get through</i>

13:00.738 --> 13:02.907
<i>before he could continue</i>
<i>his march up the ladder.</i>

13:04.116 --> 13:05.618
Guarnere:
I'm telling you boys,
we're screwed.

13:05.701 --> 13:08.162
If you ask me,
I'm glad Lieutenant Dike's
never around.

13:08.245 --> 13:10.498
Hey, you know what?
We're doing all right,

13:10.581 --> 13:13.167
even with
Foxhole Norman.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.003
Yeah, Don,
we're doing all right.
We're doing all right now.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.713
In case you ain't noticed,
there's a little town

13:17.796 --> 13:18.923
down the hill
over there, right?

13:19.006 --> 13:20.216
And in that town
are these guys,

13:20.299 --> 13:21.717
and these guys
are called Germans.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.219
And these
Germans got tanks.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.179
I know.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.179
Yeah.

13:25.262 --> 13:27.056
And our side's gonna
wanna go into that town.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.433
You wanna take one guess
at who they're gonna want

13:29.517 --> 13:31.060
to go knocking
on the goddamn doors.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.896
I know, Bill, all right?
It's me you're
talking to here.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.690
Jesus Christ,

13:36.774 --> 13:39.026
we've gotta do
all this with a C.O.

13:39.109 --> 13:40.945
who's got his head
so far up his fucking ass

13:41.028 --> 13:43.531
that lump in his throat
is his goddamn nose.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.325
Hey, 1st Sergeant.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.325
Lipton: Hey, boys.

13:46.408 --> 13:47.868
Hey, Sarge.

13:46.408 --> 13:47.868
Hey, Lip.

13:47.952 --> 13:48.786
Hey, Lip.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.788
Hey, Muck,
what's the word?

13:50.871 --> 13:52.081
Oh, you know.

13:53.123 --> 13:55.000
Sitting around
freezing our ass off.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.587
Singing Dike's praises.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.587
Oh, yeah.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.256
Lieutenant Dike.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.927
Well, I'll tell you...

14:06.512 --> 14:09.181
I wouldn't wanna be
a replacement officer
coming in here,

14:09.265 --> 14:11.684
getting thrown in
with a group of guys,

14:11.767 --> 14:14.478
who've known each other
for, what, two years?

14:16.355 --> 14:19.817
That have been in combat
together since Normandy.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.152
You're supposed to just
show up and lead them?

14:23.612 --> 14:24.989
How's a guy
do that?

14:26.156 --> 14:29.159
How could anyone really
hope to gain the respect

14:29.243 --> 14:32.121
of the toughest,
most professional,

14:32.204 --> 14:36.333
most dedicated sons of bitches
in the entire E.T.O.?

14:37.751 --> 14:38.794
Huh?

14:39.753 --> 14:41.880
So, if you ask me,
a guy'd have to...

14:41.964 --> 14:43.632
march off to Berlin

14:43.716 --> 14:47.303
and come back
with Hitler's moustache
or something.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.888
(chuckling)

14:49.972 --> 14:51.682
Anyway, listen...

14:52.725 --> 14:55.686
You guys, don't worry
about Dike, all right?

14:55.769 --> 14:56.812
Yeah.

14:56.895 --> 14:59.982
We all do our jobs,
everything'll be fine.

15:03.527 --> 15:04.570
All right.

15:05.613 --> 15:08.407
See you, Sarge.

15:05.613 --> 15:08.407
Yeah, boy.

15:08.490 --> 15:10.367
Lipton:
<i>Well, I don't know</i>
<i>if I believed any of that,</i>

15:10.451 --> 15:12.786
<i>but as Company 1st Sergeant</i>
<i>it was my job.</i>

15:13.912 --> 15:15.456
<i>Not to protect Dike,</i>

15:15.539 --> 15:18.459
<i>but to protect the integrity</i>
<i>of the company.</i>

15:18.542 --> 15:21.045
Winters:
You know what Dike's
problem is, don't you?

15:21.128 --> 15:22.338
Mmm.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.965
He's just another one
of those arrogant rich jerks
from Yale.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.926
Oh, god, not another
one of those.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.095
(laughing)

15:31.263 --> 15:32.848
Division's not gonna
let me replace him

15:32.931 --> 15:34.600
just 'cause I got
a bad feeling about him.

15:34.683 --> 15:38.270
Mm-hmm.

15:34.683 --> 15:38.270
Even if they would,
who'd I put in his place?

15:40.648 --> 15:41.940
Shames?

15:42.024 --> 15:43.984
(shouting)
Do not ever talk when
I'm talking! You got that?

15:44.068 --> 15:45.444
Winters:
<i>Shames' seen</i>
<i>too many war movies.</i>

15:45.527 --> 15:46.737
<i>Thinks he has</i>
<i>to yell all the time.</i>

15:46.820 --> 15:49.031
Both of you little crapheads
did not listen to a word

15:49.114 --> 15:50.824
I said during that briefing,
did you?

15:49.114 --> 15:50.824
Sir, yes, sir.

15:52.242 --> 15:53.160
Or Peacock?

15:53.243 --> 15:54.828
<i>God bless him,</i>
<i>no one tries harder,</i>

15:54.912 --> 15:57.831
<i>but he's not cut out</i>
<i>to take men into combat.</i>

15:57.915 --> 15:59.792
<i>I'm sure as hell not gonna</i>
<i>make him company C.O.</i>

15:59.875 --> 16:01.669
<i>when I don't even want him</i>
<i>as a platoon leader.</i>

16:03.170 --> 16:05.005
What about Compton?

16:06.131 --> 16:08.550
He's the only
real choice.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.928
<i>Buck's a real combat leader,</i>
<i>but, you know...</i>

16:13.180 --> 16:14.807
<i>I want Easy Company</i>
<i>to have at least</i>

16:14.890 --> 16:16.308
<i>one experienced</i>
<i>platoon leader.</i>

16:17.643 --> 16:20.396
Not that it matters,
anyway, 'cause I can't
get rid of Dike.

16:23.732 --> 16:26.652
Well, we all know who you'd
like to have running Easy.

16:27.986 --> 16:30.197
Trouble is it's not
your job any more, Dick.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.033
We've gotta
find somebody.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.543
Lipton:
<i>We all agreed</i>
<i>Buck Compton</i>

16:42.626 --> 16:44.420
<i>would've been the best choice</i>
<i>to run Easy...</i>

16:44.503 --> 16:46.588
<i>if Winters had been able</i>
<i>to get rid of Dike.</i>

16:49.675 --> 16:50.718
<i>But, to be honest,</i>

16:50.801 --> 16:52.219
<i>Buck wasn't the same</i>
<i>soldier he'd been</i>

16:52.302 --> 16:53.971
<i>before he got</i>
<i>shot in Holland.</i>

16:54.054 --> 16:55.764
<i>He was more</i>
<i>serious somehow.</i>

16:55.848 --> 16:58.100
He had a goddamn Luger
in his pants.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.437
Jesus.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.437
Guarnere: Dear god.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.897
And don't you two do something
stupid like that, all right?

17:03.981 --> 17:05.983
Try not to, Buck.

17:03.981 --> 17:05.983
I mean it.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.737
And you, Wild Bill,

17:09.820 --> 17:12.072
I've invested too much
goddamn time

17:12.156 --> 17:14.408
shaping you
into something useful.

17:14.491 --> 17:16.827
(chuckles)

17:14.491 --> 17:16.827
You do something crazy,

17:16.910 --> 17:18.454
get yourself knocked out
of this thing--

17:18.537 --> 17:20.080
I know, I know,
you'll kill me.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.249
Even if you're dead,
I'll still kill you.

17:22.332 --> 17:23.542
(laughter)

17:24.626 --> 17:25.836
I'll see you guys later,
all right?

17:25.919 --> 17:27.379
I'm gonna check on
the other guys.

17:33.510 --> 17:34.803
Crazy Joe McCloskey.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.805
What?

17:36.889 --> 17:38.640
This guy used to hang out
the front of Delancey's

17:38.724 --> 17:41.268
and just-- you know,
just stare at people.

17:41.351 --> 17:44.188
Yeah, I know who
Crazy Joe McCloskey is.

17:44.271 --> 17:46.273
What the hell's that got
to do with anything, Babe?

17:46.356 --> 17:48.692
Hmm, Buck kind of
reminds me of him now.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.863
What?

17:50.319 --> 17:52.863
You know, ever since
he got shot in Holland.

17:52.946 --> 17:54.072
Wait, wait, wait.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.867
Wait. What,
are you saying he's nuts?

17:56.950 --> 17:59.703
'Cause Crazy Joe McCloskey
was fucking nuts, Babe.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.121
That's why they called
him Crazy Joe.

18:01.205 --> 18:04.041
No, I'm not
saying he's nuts.
I'm just saying--

18:04.124 --> 18:05.834
What? What are
you saying?

18:06.835 --> 18:08.587
Oh, forget it.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.587
What?

18:08.670 --> 18:10.088
Forget it.

18:10.172 --> 18:11.423
Oh, come on,
you've seen him, Bill.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.510
He's-- he's all wound up
like a spring.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.303
Hey, hey, hey,
he's fine.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.266
It wasn't getting
shot that got him.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.768
It was being
in that hospital.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.437
I've been
there, okay?

18:26.396 --> 18:27.648
It ain't pretty.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.608
Yeah, mmm.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.610
Besides, you saw,
once he was up
and moving around,

18:31.693 --> 18:33.195
he was his old
self again.

18:35.197 --> 18:38.242
I'm telling you,
Buck Compton's fine.

18:40.410 --> 18:43.163
I'm serious.

18:40.410 --> 18:43.163
Penkala: Sure thing,
Buck, nothing stupid.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.706
We got it, right?

18:44.790 --> 18:47.167
We got it.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.167
All right.

18:48.335 --> 18:49.962
George?

18:48.335 --> 18:49.962
Yeah.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.465
Nothing stupid, Buck.

18:57.469 --> 18:58.762
Yeah.

19:01.348 --> 19:04.059
"Don't do anything stupid"?
Who the hell is he talking to?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.103
Bunch of morons
who volunteered to jump

19:06.186 --> 19:07.479
out of a perfectly
good airplane.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.231
Can you get any more
stupid than that?

19:09.314 --> 19:10.732
Probably not.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.732
Right.

19:11.817 --> 19:14.111
I swum across
the Niagara once.

19:14.194 --> 19:15.445
Yeah.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.532
I swear.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.410
On a bet.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.410
What, in a barrel?

19:22.870 --> 19:24.121
No.

19:24.204 --> 19:25.581
I didn't go over
the falls, George.

19:25.664 --> 19:26.790
I swam across
the river.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.750
10 miles up
from the falls.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.587
I tell you, that current
is damn strong.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.756
Oh, yeah.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.756
Must have carried me
at least two miles downstream

19:34.840 --> 19:37.551
before I got across,
but I got across.

19:37.634 --> 19:40.304
Now, personally, I didn't
think it was all that stupid,

19:40.387 --> 19:43.849
But... my mom,
my sister, Ruth--

19:43.932 --> 19:45.851
they gave me
all kinds of hell.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.102
Yeah, I bet, Muck.

19:47.185 --> 19:48.437
So did Faye.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.815
Ah, sweet Faye Tanner.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.818
Shut it, George.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.818
Well, they
had a point.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.194
You're an idiot.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.383
Dike:
I heard about Hoobler.

20:19.927 --> 20:20.928
Shame.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.431
Yes, sir. It is.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.977
That the Luger?

20:26.558 --> 20:28.977
Yes, it is.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.479
What are you
gonna do with it?

20:31.730 --> 20:32.814
I don't know yet.

20:35.108 --> 20:37.819
Where you from, Lipton?
Where'd you grow up?

20:39.446 --> 20:40.906
Huntington,
West Virginia.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.032
Huntington?

20:42.115 --> 20:43.116
Yes, sir.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.701
I don't know it.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.830
What kind of work
did you do there?

20:50.165 --> 20:52.417
My brother and I helped
my mom run a boarding house.

20:54.169 --> 20:55.295
And your father?

20:58.924 --> 21:00.884
He was...

21:00.968 --> 21:03.220
He was killed
when I was 10, sir.

21:03.303 --> 21:04.638
Automobile accident.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.350
That's sad.

21:13.897 --> 21:16.358
So, what made you decide
to join the paratroopers?

21:16.441 --> 21:20.404
I read an article
about paratroopers
in "Life" magazine.

21:20.487 --> 21:22.864
Talked about the training,
how hard it was.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.867
Said if you wanted
to make it as a paratrooper,

21:25.951 --> 21:27.285
you had to be
the best.

21:28.787 --> 21:30.539
And I wanted to fight
with the best, sir.

21:31.581 --> 21:32.624
You miss it?

21:34.292 --> 21:35.460
Miss what?

21:35.544 --> 21:36.753
Huntington.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.091
Honestly, sir,

21:41.174 --> 21:43.885
I... try not to think
about it that much.

21:47.931 --> 21:49.224
Where are you from, s...

22:09.494 --> 22:10.537
Cap'n Nixon, sir.

22:11.455 --> 22:14.207
Cap'n Nixon, sir.

22:11.455 --> 22:14.207
What?

22:14.291 --> 22:15.709
Good morning, sir,
sorry to disturb you.

22:15.792 --> 22:16.960
This came
from Division.

22:21.673 --> 22:22.758
All right.

22:26.553 --> 22:27.804
Morning.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.765
Lew, eviction notice?

22:29.848 --> 22:32.184
Not quite,
but I think I got something
that will help you

22:32.267 --> 22:33.477
with your
leadership problem.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.978
Oh, Dike's being
transferred?

22:35.062 --> 22:36.438
No, I can't help you
with that,

22:36.521 --> 22:38.607
but Division has decided
to pluck one officer

22:38.690 --> 22:40.150
from each regiment
that served

22:40.233 --> 22:42.402
in the heroic defense
of Bastogne,

22:42.486 --> 22:45.363
send him back to the states
on a 30-day furlough.

22:45.447 --> 22:47.991
Get him out banging the drum
for the war bond drive,

22:48.075 --> 22:49.201
that kind
of thing.

22:50.077 --> 22:51.661
It turns out
I've been plucked.

22:55.207 --> 22:58.251
Hey, that's fantastic, Lew,
good for you.

22:58.335 --> 23:01.254
Thank you.

22:58.335 --> 23:01.254
How in the world does
your leaving help me?

23:01.338 --> 23:02.589
It doesn't.
I'm not going.

23:02.672 --> 23:04.674
I've already seen the states.
I grew up there.

23:04.758 --> 23:05.926
That's why
I came to Europe.

23:06.009 --> 23:08.095
I just wish they'd told me
there was a war on.

23:08.178 --> 23:10.430
Anyway, the point is,
this thing's wasted on me.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.641
But I'm sure we can find
an officer somewhere

23:12.724 --> 23:15.060
in this battalion who could
use a long trip home.

23:17.020 --> 23:18.605
Congratulations,
Lieutenant Peacock.

23:18.688 --> 23:20.941
I can't think of anybody
who deserves this more.

23:21.024 --> 23:22.192
Thanks.

23:21.024 --> 23:22.192
(laughter)

23:24.027 --> 23:26.363
I'm really glad
that you're going home.

23:26.446 --> 23:29.032
Okay.

23:26.446 --> 23:29.032
Best news I've heard
in weeks.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.575
Hell of a guy,
hell of a guy.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.702
Thanks, guys, I mean.

23:32.786 --> 23:33.954
It really means
a lot, you know?

23:34.037 --> 23:36.498
Oh, get out of here.

23:34.037 --> 23:36.498
(laughter, chatter)

23:36.581 --> 23:38.083
Three cheers
for Lieutenant Peacock, group.

23:38.166 --> 23:39.292
Hip hip...

23:38.166 --> 23:39.292
All: Hooray.

23:39.376 --> 23:41.211
Hip hip hooray.

23:41.294 --> 23:42.337
Hip hip
hooray.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.339
(film camera clicking)

23:42.420 --> 23:44.339
(no distinct audio)

23:51.972 --> 23:54.141
(laughter)

23:55.433 --> 23:56.643
Sink:
If they come by here,

23:56.726 --> 23:58.395
y'all remember
to smile for the camera.

23:58.478 --> 24:01.398
Got to keep the morale up
for them folks back home.

24:01.481 --> 24:03.024
Why?

24:03.108 --> 24:04.693
Damned if I know.

24:04.776 --> 24:07.863
All right, Nix,
what have they got
waiting for us in Foy?

24:07.946 --> 24:10.699
At least one company
from the 10th Panzergrenadiers

24:10.782 --> 24:11.825
dug in along here.

24:11.908 --> 24:13.869
They've also got
at least one 88,

24:13.952 --> 24:15.745
although we haven't been
able to spot it yet.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.039
How about armor?

24:18.123 --> 24:19.958
As of last night,
three Tigers.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.835
Would you excuse me
for a moment, sir?

24:21.918 --> 24:23.044
Yeah.

24:23.128 --> 24:26.173
Toye:
How do I feel about being
rescued by Patton?

24:26.256 --> 24:28.175
Well, I'd feel
pretty peachy about it,

24:28.258 --> 24:30.010
if it wasn't
for one thing--

24:30.093 --> 24:32.721
we didn't need
to be fucking rescued
by Patton.

24:33.805 --> 24:34.723
You got that?

24:34.806 --> 24:37.392
Joe. Excuse us
for a moment.

24:38.643 --> 24:39.895
Sorry, sir.

24:39.978 --> 24:42.189
Sorry about what?
Patton?

24:43.106 --> 24:44.357
I couldn't
agree more.

24:44.441 --> 24:45.483
What are you
doing here?

24:45.567 --> 24:47.235
I wanna head back
to the line, sir.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.862
Joe, you don't
have to do that.

24:48.945 --> 24:51.364
Get yourself back
to the aid station.
Heal up.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.992
I'd really like to head back
with the fellas, sir.

24:57.537 --> 25:00.582
All right, then go.

24:57.537 --> 25:00.582
Thank you, sir.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.049
Lipton:<i> Joe Toye had been</i>
<i>at the aid station</i>
<i>for three days,</i>

25:09.132 --> 25:11.259
<i>and everybody was glad</i>
<i>to have him back.</i>

25:11.343 --> 25:13.220
<i>Especially</i>
<i>Bill Guarnere.</i>

25:14.679 --> 25:16.223
Hey, Joe.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.223
Hey, Bill.

25:16.306 --> 25:17.807
Good to see you, pal.

25:16.306 --> 25:17.807
You, too.

25:17.891 --> 25:19.059
What the hell
you doing back here?

25:19.142 --> 25:21.061
I had to make sure
you were on top of things.

25:21.144 --> 25:22.312
I'm on top
of things.

25:22.395 --> 25:24.314
Tied me own boots
once last week.

25:24.397 --> 25:25.690
All by myself.

25:24.397 --> 25:25.690
(laughs)

25:25.774 --> 25:28.235
(laughs)
Hey, fellas,
look who I found.

25:28.318 --> 25:30.987
Hey, Joe Toye,
back for more.

25:28.318 --> 25:30.987
Toye: Hey, Muck. How are you?

25:31.071 --> 25:33.615
How are you, Joe?

25:31.071 --> 25:33.615
Yeah, doing pretty good.

25:33.698 --> 25:36.076
Escaped from
the aid station.

25:33.698 --> 25:36.076
Where'd you get hit?

25:36.159 --> 25:37.327
What's that?

25:37.410 --> 25:39.871
Ah, it's Webb.
Replacement.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.581
Really?
Thought it was some guy

25:41.665 --> 25:44.125
I've known for two years
and I forgot his face.

25:44.209 --> 25:45.460
Joe got hit
in the arm.

25:45.543 --> 25:47.545
New Year's Eve gift
from the<i> Luftwaffe.</i>

25:47.629 --> 25:49.839
Jesus.

25:47.629 --> 25:49.839
A lot of you guys
been injured?

25:49.923 --> 25:51.675
It's called "wounded,"
peanut.

25:51.758 --> 25:54.844
Injured's when you fall
out of a tree or something.

25:54.928 --> 25:57.347
Don't worry,
there's enough crap
flying around here,

25:57.430 --> 25:59.099
you're bound
to get dinged sometime.

25:59.182 --> 26:00.892
Almost every single
one of these guys

26:00.976 --> 26:02.686
has been hit
at least once.

26:02.769 --> 26:04.521
Except for Alley,
he's a two-timer.

26:04.604 --> 26:06.982
He landed on broken glass
in Normandy

26:07.065 --> 26:09.442
and got peppered by
a potato masher in Holland.

26:09.526 --> 26:10.735
You'll find out, son.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.780
Now, Bull, he got a piece
of exploding tank in Holland.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.283
And George Luz here...

26:16.366 --> 26:17.742
has never been hit.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.119
You're one
lucky bastard.

26:19.202 --> 26:20.328
Takes one to
know one, Skip.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.247
Ah, consider us
blessed.

26:22.330 --> 26:25.292
Now, Liebgott,
the skinny little guy,

26:25.375 --> 26:27.168
he got pinked
in the neck in Holland.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.170
And right next to him,
that other skinny little guy,

26:29.254 --> 26:32.382
that's Popeye.
He got shot in his scrawny
little butt in Normandy.

26:34.050 --> 26:37.887
And Buck got shot in his
rather large butt in Holland.

26:37.971 --> 26:39.889
Yeah, kind of
an Easy Company tradition,

26:39.973 --> 26:41.224
getting shot
in the ass.

26:41.308 --> 26:43.893
Hey, even 1st Sergeant Lipton
over there,

26:43.977 --> 26:47.731
he got a couple of pieces
of a tank shell burst
at Carentan.

26:47.814 --> 26:49.482
One chunk
in the face.

26:49.566 --> 26:51.818
Another chunk almost
took out his nuts.

26:52.944 --> 26:54.446
How are those nuts,
Sarge?

26:54.529 --> 26:56.197
Doing fine, Bill.

26:57.407 --> 26:58.616
Nice of you
to ask.

27:01.578 --> 27:03.121
Lipton:
<i>On the afternoon</i>
<i>of January 3rd,</i>

27:03.204 --> 27:05.582
<i>most of "E" Company headed</i>
<i>back to our old position</i>

27:05.665 --> 27:07.542
<i>in the woods</i>
<i>overlooking Foy.</i>

27:07.625 --> 27:09.294
<i>A few men remained</i>
<i>in the Bois Jacques</i>

27:09.377 --> 27:12.297
<i>attached to "D" Company</i>
<i>to hold the main line</i>
<i>of resistance.</i>

27:13.381 --> 27:14.674
Good luck, ladies.

27:16.384 --> 27:17.969
Been nice
knowing you.

27:19.137 --> 27:21.014
Wouldn't drink too much
if I were you.

27:21.097 --> 27:23.308
Hey, be careful
if he offers you
a cigarette.

27:23.391 --> 27:24.517
What are they
talking about?

27:24.601 --> 27:26.394
If who offers us
a cigarette?

27:26.478 --> 27:27.562
Speirs.

27:27.645 --> 27:29.439
Who?

27:27.645 --> 27:29.439
Lieutenant Speirs.

27:32.650 --> 27:33.818
Lipton:
<i>Lieutenant Ronald Speirs was</i>

27:33.902 --> 27:36.071
<i>one of the platoon leaders</i>
<i>in "D" Company.</i>

27:36.154 --> 27:38.406
<i>He was already</i>
<i>a legend.</i>

27:38.490 --> 27:41.284
Christenson:
<i>The stories about Speirs are</i>
<i>probably all bullshit anyway.</i>

27:41.368 --> 27:42.619
What stories?

27:44.120 --> 27:45.705
What stories?

27:45.789 --> 27:48.958
Well, supposedly Speirs
shot one of his own men
for being drunk.

27:49.042 --> 27:52.921
You're kidding.
That's unbelievable.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.799
Yeah, and there's another one
about him giving cigarettes

27:55.882 --> 27:59.010
to 20 German POWs
before killing 'em.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.096
He shot 20 POWs?

28:01.179 --> 28:03.765
Well, actually, I heard
it was more like 30.

28:03.848 --> 28:04.933
Speirs:
Christenson.

28:05.892 --> 28:06.935
Lieutenant Speirs.

28:07.018 --> 28:09.270
I got the name right,
didn't I, Christenson?

28:09.354 --> 28:10.522
Yes, sir.

28:11.856 --> 28:13.400
What are you men
doing out here?

28:14.317 --> 28:15.819
We're watching
the line, sir.

28:18.321 --> 28:19.572
Well, keep up
the good work.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.533
While you're at it, you might
wanna reinforce your cover.

28:21.616 --> 28:23.576
Oh, actually, sir,
Lieutenant Dike said
not even to bother,

28:23.660 --> 28:24.994
that we're only
gonna be here one day.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.871
Lieutenant Dike
said that, huh?

28:29.541 --> 28:30.625
Then forget
what I said.

28:33.294 --> 28:34.337
Carry on.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.301
Oh, anyone
care for a smoke?

28:45.390 --> 28:46.433
You?

28:48.935 --> 28:50.895
Lipton:
<i>Late in the afternoon</i>
<i>on January 3rd,</i>

28:50.979 --> 28:54.065
<i>we returned</i>
<i>to our old position</i>
<i>in the woods overlooking Foy.</i>

28:54.149 --> 28:57.235
Oh, you gotta be
fucking kiddin' me!

28:58.778 --> 29:01.948
Someone's gonna die.
Someone's gonna fucking die.

29:02.031 --> 29:03.450
Guarnere,
look at this shit!

29:03.533 --> 29:05.160
One of those
1st Battalion fuckers

29:05.243 --> 29:06.786
took a dump
in my foxhole!

29:06.870 --> 29:09.456
I think they shit
in everyone's foxhole, Joe.

29:11.916 --> 29:14.836
I don't think
they wanted to spend
much time above ground.

29:17.797 --> 29:19.090
Lipton:
<i>While we were</i>
<i>in the Bois Jacques,</i>

29:19.174 --> 29:21.342
<i>the Germans had been</i>
<i>shelling our old position.</i>

29:21.426 --> 29:23.678
<i>There were signs</i>
<i>of tree bursts everywhere.</i>

29:23.761 --> 29:25.680
<i>That got</i>
<i>our attention.</i>

29:25.763 --> 29:27.348
Man:
Light and noise
discipline.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.309
We're getting close.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.612
Lipton:
<i>Looking across</i>
<i>the field at Foy,</i>

29:40.695 --> 29:42.113
<i>I could see</i>
<i>enemy troops.</i>

29:42.197 --> 29:44.282
<i>I still couldn't see</i>
<i>their artillery,</i>

29:44.365 --> 29:46.159
<i>but I knew it was</i>
<i>down there.</i>

29:49.621 --> 29:51.789
Oh, looks like the Krauts
have been pounding this area

29:51.873 --> 29:53.166
with pretty
big stuff, 88s.

29:53.249 --> 29:56.377
I'd say they got this whole
stretch of the line targeted.

29:56.461 --> 29:57.795
Well, they're
not shelling now.

29:57.879 --> 29:59.214
Maybe they've got
a new target--

29:59.297 --> 30:00.715
No, they're
just waiting.

30:00.798 --> 30:03.384
For what?

30:00.798 --> 30:03.384
For us to re-occupy
the position.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.720
Maybe we should
fall back to a different
location, dig in.

30:05.803 --> 30:07.847
No, it's our job
to hold the line here.

30:08.848 --> 30:10.058
We've got pretty
good foxholes.

30:10.141 --> 30:11.267
We just need
to fortify the covers.

30:11.351 --> 30:12.894
If they've got us
targeted, maybe--

30:12.977 --> 30:15.563
We hold the line here.

30:15.647 --> 30:16.940
Sergeant
Lipton's right.

30:17.023 --> 30:19.359
We're gonna
strengthen our covers
and we're gonna hang in.

30:19.442 --> 30:21.986
We're not gonna
fall back.

30:23.863 --> 30:25.114
Right, Lieutenant?

30:26.783 --> 30:29.035
Mmm?

30:26.783 --> 30:29.035
Right, Lieutenant?

30:29.118 --> 30:32.038
Fine. You all
take care of it.

30:33.206 --> 30:34.749
I gotta go talk
to regiment.

30:38.294 --> 30:39.963
We'd better
get moving.

30:38.294 --> 30:39.963
Yeah.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.427
Here you go, Bill.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.427
Hey, thanks, Lip.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.096
You got it. I'll get
you some more branches.

30:48.179 --> 30:49.722
I'd appreciate that.

30:48.179 --> 30:49.722
Yup.

31:08.825 --> 31:11.578
(artillery firing)

31:08.825 --> 31:11.578
(shell whooshes)

31:11.661 --> 31:13.246
(explosions)

31:13.329 --> 31:15.248
Incoming!

31:15.331 --> 31:16.916
Take cover!

31:19.294 --> 31:21.838
Take cover!

31:19.294 --> 31:21.838
Man: Move it!

31:21.921 --> 31:23.464
(men shouting)

31:25.383 --> 31:28.469
Take cover! Come on,
find some cover.

31:29.387 --> 31:30.888
Guarnere:
They got us zeroed!

31:32.599 --> 31:34.809
Find some cover,
find a foxhole!

31:34.892 --> 31:36.686
Come on,
take cover!

31:38.187 --> 31:39.856
Take cover!

31:44.694 --> 31:46.904
Come on,
find some cover!

31:50.366 --> 31:51.951
Take cover!

31:53.286 --> 31:54.746
Shit.

32:04.213 --> 32:06.799
Come on, find some cover,
find some cover!

32:16.225 --> 32:17.518
Lipton:
<i>For some reason,</i>
<i>at that moment,</i>

32:17.602 --> 32:19.604
<i>in that half-finished foxhole,</i>
<i>all I could think about</i>

32:19.687 --> 32:21.689
<i>was the 4th of July</i>
<i>when I was a kid.</i>

32:21.773 --> 32:24.025
<i>I loved to make</i>
<i>my own firecrackers,</i>

32:24.108 --> 32:25.610
<i>cherry bombs,</i>
<i>lady fingers.</i>

32:27.195 --> 32:29.947
<i>I loved to blow up dirt clods</i>
<i>and pop bottles and the like.</i>

32:30.031 --> 32:32.075
<i>Looked forward to it</i>
<i>all year long.</i>

32:33.242 --> 32:34.786
<i>What I saw that day</i>
<i>was the most awesome</i>

32:34.869 --> 32:36.704
<i>and terrifying</i>
<i>display of firepower</i>

32:36.788 --> 32:39.248
<i>I'd ever seen</i>
<i>in my life.</i>

32:39.332 --> 32:41.000
(laughing)

32:39.332 --> 32:41.000
<i>Of course, I wouldn't</i>
<i>have been laughing</i>

32:41.084 --> 32:42.919
<i>if I'd known</i>
<i>what happened</i>
<i>to Joe Toye.</i>

32:55.598 --> 32:57.517
(grunting)

33:19.789 --> 33:22.250
(wheezing)

33:44.063 --> 33:45.648
Maybe we should see
if anybody's hit.

33:45.732 --> 33:47.567
Yeah, Malark,
that's what they want.

33:47.650 --> 33:49.819
The Krauts are trying
to draw us out in the open.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.665
Stay in
your foxholes.

34:03.666 --> 34:05.334
Stay in your
foxholes!

34:06.294 --> 34:07.837
Are you okay?
Can you walk?

34:07.920 --> 34:09.130
Come on,
find a foxhole, come on.

34:09.213 --> 34:10.965
Toye:
I gotta get up.

34:14.802 --> 34:16.304
I gotta get up.

34:18.973 --> 34:20.808
I gotta get up.

34:23.644 --> 34:24.937
I need my helmet.

34:26.981 --> 34:28.775
(distant shout)
I need help!

34:28.858 --> 34:29.776
You hear that?

34:29.859 --> 34:31.527
I need help!

34:29.859 --> 34:31.527
Is that Joe?

34:33.988 --> 34:36.074
Help!

34:33.988 --> 34:36.074
Yeah, I think that's Joe.

34:37.992 --> 34:39.285
Stay.

34:40.453 --> 34:42.455
Stay down!
Stay down!

34:42.538 --> 34:43.748
Stay down!

34:43.831 --> 34:45.416
Stay in your
foxholes!

34:45.500 --> 34:47.335
Stay in
your foxholes!

34:47.418 --> 34:48.836
Heffron: Help!

34:49.879 --> 34:51.589
Help, anyone there?

34:52.965 --> 34:54.675
Jesus.

34:54.759 --> 34:56.344
I gotta get up.

34:57.386 --> 34:59.806
I gotta--
I gotta get up.

35:02.183 --> 35:03.267
Shit.

35:03.351 --> 35:05.520
Come on, Joe,
come on, buddy.

35:05.603 --> 35:08.481
Come on.
Come on, pal.

35:08.564 --> 35:11.067
You said you'd get back
to the states before me.

35:11.150 --> 35:13.319
You ain't going anywhere.
You're all right.

35:13.402 --> 35:16.197
(screams)
I gotta get my helmet.

35:13.402 --> 35:16.197
Forget it.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.157
I gotta get
my helmet.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.157
Forget it, Joe.

35:18.241 --> 35:20.034
Anyone there?

35:20.117 --> 35:21.869
Hang on.

35:20.117 --> 35:21.869
Help!

35:24.413 --> 35:26.749
Who's that?

35:24.413 --> 35:26.749
Heffron:
It's Heff. Babe.

35:26.833 --> 35:28.709
Come on, get me
out of here, Lip.

35:32.129 --> 35:33.756
Come on.

35:32.129 --> 35:33.756
I gotta get to the hole.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.007
I got you.

35:35.091 --> 35:37.218
I gotta get to the foxhole.

35:35.091 --> 35:37.218
Come on, Joe,
I got you.

35:37.301 --> 35:39.428
(grunting)

35:40.930 --> 35:41.973
Come on, Joe.

35:44.392 --> 35:45.434
Hang on.

35:46.352 --> 35:47.687
Are you okay?

35:46.352 --> 35:47.687
Yeah.

35:47.770 --> 35:49.605
Come on, come on.

35:49.689 --> 35:52.817
Ah, jeez, think I overdid it
on the cover for my foxhole?

35:52.900 --> 35:55.987
Incoming!

35:52.900 --> 35:55.987
Man: Incoming!

35:58.406 --> 36:00.741
Take cover!

36:08.332 --> 36:10.126
Come on, come on!

36:10.209 --> 36:13.713
Hurry up, Guarno,
you're gonna get bombed!

36:13.796 --> 36:15.214
Come on, come on!

36:15.298 --> 36:17.216
Move it, Bill! Move it!

36:18.718 --> 36:19.969
Come on, Joe.

36:21.095 --> 36:23.389
Hold on, I'll be there,
I'm gonna help you.

36:24.599 --> 36:27.101
No!

36:29.353 --> 36:31.022
Medic!

36:36.986 --> 36:39.780
Lipton:
<i>During the second barrage</i>
<i>I wasn't laughing anymore.</i>

37:18.194 --> 37:19.236
Lip!

37:20.196 --> 37:21.948
Medic!

37:22.031 --> 37:23.324
Are you okay?

37:23.407 --> 37:24.659
(distant shouting)

37:27.328 --> 37:28.537
Stay down!

37:29.956 --> 37:31.457
You stay down!

37:31.540 --> 37:33.626
1st Sergeant Lipton?

37:33.709 --> 37:36.879
You get things
organized here.
I'm gonna go for help.

37:40.967 --> 37:43.135
What the fuck?

37:47.598 --> 37:49.976
Lip, where the fuck's
he going?

37:50.059 --> 37:52.061
I don't know.
Listen, get Battalion
on the line.

37:52.144 --> 37:53.521
Tell them
to notify B.A.S.

37:53.604 --> 37:54.730
Battalion's up, Lip.

38:06.575 --> 38:08.786
M-m-- m--

38:08.869 --> 38:10.621
medic!

38:19.964 --> 38:21.340
Stay ready,
stay ready.

38:21.424 --> 38:23.801
Those stupid
sons of bitches might be
trying to come through.

38:23.884 --> 38:25.845
You okay, One Lung?

38:23.884 --> 38:25.845
Sergeant!

38:25.928 --> 38:27.179
How you doing,
Popeye?

38:27.263 --> 38:29.056
One hundred percent ready
to kill Germans, Lip.

38:29.140 --> 38:32.435
(groaning)

38:34.729 --> 38:36.397
Okay, Joe.

38:41.110 --> 38:42.903
Doc, what can I do?

38:41.110 --> 38:42.903
Hold this.

38:45.948 --> 38:48.617
You got a smoke?

38:48.701 --> 38:53.330
Jesus, what's a guy gotta do
to get killed around here?

38:53.414 --> 38:55.708
Joe.

38:53.414 --> 38:55.708
Bill, you're
going first.

38:55.791 --> 38:58.377
Whatever you say, doc,
whatever you say.

38:58.461 --> 39:00.838
Over here!
Take this man.

39:00.921 --> 39:03.966
Hey, Lip, they got
old Guarnere this time.

39:04.050 --> 39:06.052
We got you, soldier.

39:04.050 --> 39:06.052
(screams)

39:08.929 --> 39:10.556
Just lie back.

39:14.351 --> 39:17.104
Take it easy.

39:14.351 --> 39:17.104
Hey, Joe, I told you I'd beat
you back to the states.

39:19.356 --> 39:21.108
Hey, Lip.

39:24.111 --> 39:25.279
How's Buck?

39:27.281 --> 39:28.741
Luz, how's Buck?

39:28.824 --> 39:30.076
He's fine.

39:30.159 --> 39:31.660
You sure?

39:30.159 --> 39:31.660
Yes, he's fine.

39:32.995 --> 39:35.247
I think you should probably
go talk to him now, huh?

39:38.834 --> 39:40.044
All right.

39:50.387 --> 39:53.140
Lipton:
<i>Some say Buck changed</i>
<i>after he was shot in Holland.</i>

39:53.224 --> 39:55.226
Lieutenant.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.226
<i>Maybe...</i>

39:55.309 --> 39:56.560
<i>but I know something</i>
<i>happened to him,</i>

39:56.644 --> 39:58.646
<i>when he saw</i>
<i>Toye and Guarnere</i>
<i>on the ground.</i>

39:58.729 --> 40:00.231
It's all right.

40:05.694 --> 40:07.279
(chattering)

40:09.198 --> 40:11.700
Lipton:
<i>On the report it said Compton</i>
<i>was being taken off the line</i>

40:11.784 --> 40:14.328
<i>because of a bad case</i>
<i>of trenchfoot.</i>

40:14.411 --> 40:16.789
<i>Didn't say anything about</i>
<i>him losing his friends.</i>

40:21.544 --> 40:23.003
Man:
Try and squeeze my hand.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.507
Lipton:<i> Buck was</i>
<i>a great combat leader.</i>

40:27.424 --> 40:29.301
<i>He was wounded</i>
<i>in Normandy</i>

40:29.385 --> 40:30.719
<i>and again</i>
<i>in Holland.</i>

40:30.803 --> 40:33.055
<i>He received the Silver Star</i>
<i>for his part in taking out</i>

40:33.139 --> 40:34.849
<i>those German guns</i>
<i>on D day.</i>

40:34.932 --> 40:37.893
<i>He took everything</i>
<i>the Krauts could throw</i>
<i>at him time and again.</i>

40:39.270 --> 40:40.729
Lieutenant Compton?

40:42.565 --> 40:45.234
Malarkey:
<i>"UCLA did not make</i>
<i>the Rose Bowl this winter,</i>

40:45.317 --> 40:48.112
<i>"probably because</i>
<i>you weren't there.</i>

40:48.195 --> 40:50.573
"I'm sure you're teaching
all of your young soldiers

40:50.656 --> 40:53.200
"the joy you have
of the sport.

40:53.284 --> 40:56.203
"Gosh, how we all know what
an exciting young man you are,

40:56.287 --> 40:58.706
and how your heart
and love..."

41:02.293 --> 41:04.253
Lipton:
<i>I guess he just couldn't</i>
<i>take seeing his friends,</i>

41:04.336 --> 41:06.380
<i>Toye and Guarnere,</i>
<i>all torn up like that.</i>

41:07.965 --> 41:10.092
<i>No one ever thought</i>
<i>any less of him for it.</i>

41:21.145 --> 41:22.438
Hey, Bull.

41:23.731 --> 41:25.024
Lipton:
<i>With Buck off the line,</i>

41:25.107 --> 41:26.984
<i>there was</i>
<i>no longer any possible</i>
<i>alternative to Dike.</i>

41:27.067 --> 41:28.152
He went that way
a little while ago.

41:28.235 --> 41:29.778
Lipton:
<i>At least none</i>
<i>we could see.</i>

41:29.862 --> 41:31.030
Thanks.

41:34.033 --> 41:35.242
Hey, Muck.

41:36.619 --> 41:38.287
Muck.

41:36.619 --> 41:38.287
Yes, Sergeant?

41:38.370 --> 41:39.705
I'm looking
for Lieutenant Dike.

41:39.788 --> 41:41.498
<i>We were stuck</i>
<i>with Dike.</i>

41:39.788 --> 41:41.498
I think he's over there.

41:41.582 --> 41:43.042
<i>And he was off</i>
<i>taking a walk.</i>

41:43.125 --> 41:44.585
Thanks.

41:43.125 --> 41:44.585
Sure thing.

41:49.298 --> 41:51.300
Winters:
Lightning six kidnap.

41:52.509 --> 41:53.552
Ah, yes, sir.

41:53.636 --> 41:55.429
We've cleared all the green
area between, er...

41:55.512 --> 41:57.556
Lipton:
<i>We'd cleared the woods</i>
<i>east of Foy.</i>

41:57.640 --> 42:00.518
<i>So, a few days later</i>
<i>"E" Company and the rest</i>
<i>of the 506</i>

42:00.601 --> 42:02.561
<i>cleared the woods</i>
<i>west of Foy.</i>

42:02.645 --> 42:04.271
<i>There was little</i>
<i>resistance.</i>

42:05.314 --> 42:08.817
We have KIA...

42:05.314 --> 42:08.817
13.

42:08.901 --> 42:10.945
Luz: You fellas
know I got no reason
to bullshit you, right?

42:11.028 --> 42:12.905
Man: Yeah, right.

42:11.028 --> 42:12.905
(laughing)

42:12.988 --> 42:14.281
Look, I'm not gonna
bullshit you.

42:14.365 --> 42:15.491
This is
what I saw.

42:15.574 --> 42:18.577
It was so unbelievable,
you might not believe me.

42:18.661 --> 42:20.329
So, you-know-who comes
running up to Lipton.

42:20.412 --> 42:22.164
He's got no helmet,
no gear, no nothing.

42:22.248 --> 42:25.668
(mimics Dike)
"Ah, 1st Sergeant Lipton,
you organize things here,

42:25.751 --> 42:27.795
"and I'm gonna
go for... help.

42:29.296 --> 42:30.798
I need to go polish
my oak leaf clusters."

42:30.881 --> 42:32.466
(clears throat)
Hey, Luz.

42:32.549 --> 42:34.468
A complete asshole.

42:32.549 --> 42:34.468
That's really good.

42:34.551 --> 42:36.762
It's okay.

42:34.551 --> 42:36.762
Um, fellas.

42:36.845 --> 42:38.389
Goodnight,
goodnight all.

42:38.472 --> 42:40.099
Yeah, see you, Luz.
See you, Malark.

42:40.182 --> 42:41.725
What can I do
for you, Sarge?

42:41.809 --> 42:44.812
Two things. First,
great impression of Dike.

42:44.895 --> 42:46.855
You think so?
I thought it
was a little off.

42:46.939 --> 42:48.315
No, you got it
pretty good.

42:48.399 --> 42:50.651
Second,
don't do it any more,

42:50.734 --> 42:53.529
especially the part about
what he said to me.

42:53.612 --> 42:55.364
It doesn't do
anybody any good, okay?

42:55.447 --> 42:57.616
Yeah, I got you.

42:55.447 --> 42:57.616
All right.

42:58.867 --> 43:01.370
(mimics Dike yawning)

42:58.867 --> 43:01.370
(chuckles)

43:01.453 --> 43:02.663
Wise ass.

43:09.670 --> 43:12.256
Incoming!

43:29.315 --> 43:30.816
Luz!

43:30.899 --> 43:32.818
Come on!
Hurry!

43:32.901 --> 43:34.737
Luz!

43:34.820 --> 43:37.573
Stay down!
Stay down!

43:37.656 --> 43:39.158
Come on!

43:39.241 --> 43:40.784
Get in here!

43:39.241 --> 43:40.784
Come on!

43:40.868 --> 43:41.910
Luz!

43:42.870 --> 43:46.415
Come on!

43:42.870 --> 43:46.415
Come on! Luz!

43:53.797 --> 43:55.215
(grunts)

44:17.237 --> 44:19.907
Muck and Penkala!

44:19.990 --> 44:21.033
What?

44:21.116 --> 44:24.078
Muck and Penkala
got hit!

44:30.417 --> 44:32.169
Ahh!

44:32.252 --> 44:33.420
Medic!

44:35.923 --> 44:37.758
Medic!

44:37.841 --> 44:39.259
Hashey.

44:39.343 --> 44:41.595
It's my shoulder.

44:41.678 --> 44:43.597
Come on,
get up!

44:48.060 --> 44:51.438
Man:
Stay down 'til you
get the all clear.

44:51.522 --> 44:53.065
(hissing)

44:53.148 --> 44:54.650
(distant shouting)

44:56.026 --> 44:58.070
Man:
All clear!

45:03.367 --> 45:04.827
(lighter clinks, flicks)

45:13.252 --> 45:14.670
Thought you
didn't smoke.

45:14.753 --> 45:16.547
I don't.

45:14.753 --> 45:16.547
Uh-huh.

45:28.100 --> 45:31.228
Lipton:<i> The shell</i>
<i>that hit the foxhole Luz</i>
<i>and I were in was a dud.</i>

45:32.563 --> 45:34.857
<i>The one that hit Muck</i>
<i>and Penkala's foxhole wasn't.</i>

45:34.940 --> 45:36.608
<i>That's just</i>
<i>the way it was.</i>

45:37.776 --> 45:39.820
<i>Muck and Penkala</i>
<i>were good men.</i>

45:43.532 --> 45:45.367
<i>Their death hit Malarkey</i>
<i>the hardest.</i>

45:45.451 --> 45:46.952
<i>Malarkey's best friends</i>
<i>in the company</i>

45:47.035 --> 45:48.704
<i>had been Compton,</i>
<i>Muck, and Penkala.</i>

45:48.787 --> 45:51.165
<i>In less than a week,</i>
<i>he'd seen two of them die.</i>

45:54.418 --> 45:55.461
What's the word?

45:55.544 --> 45:56.920
Well, the men on
the line are okay.

45:57.004 --> 45:58.672
Food has just
been re-supplied.

45:58.755 --> 46:00.966
We're in good shape.

45:58.755 --> 46:00.966
Okay, we'll just
hunker down.

46:01.049 --> 46:02.342
We might get
some relief soon.

46:02.426 --> 46:04.219
Uh-huh.

46:02.426 --> 46:04.219
Okay?
All right.

46:18.650 --> 46:19.776
All right.

46:25.449 --> 46:27.784
Lipton:
<i>Later that day we were</i>
<i>back in our old position,</i>

46:27.868 --> 46:29.828
<i>overlooking Foy.</i>

46:29.912 --> 46:31.705
<i>We were all worried</i>
<i>about Malarkey.</i>

46:32.956 --> 46:34.082
Lipton:
Hey, Malark.

46:39.338 --> 46:41.423
Hey, er...

46:41.507 --> 46:44.092
Didn't I hear you say
you wanted to bring

46:44.176 --> 46:45.886
a Luger home
for your kid brother?

46:49.556 --> 46:50.557
Yeah.

46:53.977 --> 46:57.022
Well, why don't you--

46:57.105 --> 46:58.565
why don't you
give him that?

47:02.778 --> 47:04.279
It's Hoob's, right?

47:04.363 --> 47:05.364
Yeah.

47:05.447 --> 47:08.158
Yeah, I was gonna
get rid of it,

47:08.242 --> 47:10.744
but I-- I don't know.

47:12.955 --> 47:16.708
Listen, Cap'n Winters
was wondering if you wanted

47:16.792 --> 47:18.252
to go back
to Battalion and...

47:18.335 --> 47:20.712
work as his runner
for a few days.

47:25.008 --> 47:28.220
Tell him thanks, I'm--
I'm gonna stay here.

47:30.097 --> 47:32.140
Well, look,
why don't you

47:32.224 --> 47:33.850
at least come back
for an hour or so,

47:33.934 --> 47:35.310
say goodbye to Buck.

47:35.394 --> 47:36.895
I'm sure it'll
mean a lot to him.

47:42.943 --> 47:43.986
All right.

47:47.489 --> 47:50.742
You be careful
with that.

47:47.489 --> 47:50.742
Yeah.

47:50.826 --> 47:52.578
Lipton:
<i>Getting even 50 yards</i>
<i>back from the line,</i>

47:52.661 --> 47:54.496
<i>just for an hour or two</i>
<i>could make a big difference</i>

47:54.580 --> 47:56.164
<i>in a soldier's</i>
<i>state of mind.</i>

48:00.794 --> 48:03.964
<i>The morning after the shelling</i>
<i>that killed Muck and Penkala,</i>

48:04.047 --> 48:06.800
<i>I saw a soldier try to dig</i>
<i>a foxhole with his bare hands.</i>

48:06.884 --> 48:10.137
Private.

48:06.884 --> 48:10.137
<i>He didn't notice that he'd</i>
<i>torn off all his fingernails.</i>

48:10.220 --> 48:11.471
Private.

48:11.555 --> 48:13.890
<i>I got him out</i>
<i>of there quickly.</i>

48:13.974 --> 48:15.851
<i>Not for his sake,</i>
<i>but for ours.</i>

48:16.893 --> 48:18.645
<i>Fear is poison</i>
<i>in combat.</i>

48:18.729 --> 48:21.273
It's something we all felt,
but you just didn't show it.

48:21.356 --> 48:22.399
<i>You can't.</i>

48:22.482 --> 48:25.152
<i>It's destructive</i>
<i>and it's contagious.</i>

48:28.071 --> 48:29.406
Told you I'd
get you started.

48:29.489 --> 48:30.699
Man:
We got a bleeder here.

48:36.747 --> 48:38.123
Lipton:
<i>Buck was never the same</i>

48:38.206 --> 48:41.084
<i>after seeing</i>
<i>Toye and Guarnere</i>
<i>get hit that day.</i>

48:41.168 --> 48:43.545
<i>I guess he just needed</i>
<i>some time away from it all.</i>

48:56.224 --> 48:57.184
Boys.

48:57.267 --> 48:58.727
Lipton:
<i>The barrages</i>
<i>on January 3rd</i>

48:58.810 --> 49:00.145
<i>and the shelling</i>
<i>on January 9th</i>

49:00.228 --> 49:01.313
<i>marked the low point</i>
<i>in the war</i>

49:01.396 --> 49:03.815
<i>for many of the men</i>
<i>in "E" Company.</i>

49:03.899 --> 49:06.568
<i>Even then,</i>
<i>very few actually broke.</i>

49:06.652 --> 49:08.236
<i>But I knew the terror</i>
<i>of those shellings</i>

49:08.320 --> 49:09.863
<i>and the unrelenting</i>
<i>pressure we'd been under</i>

49:09.946 --> 49:12.949
<i>since we got to Bastogne</i>
<i>could take their toll</i>
<i>in other ways.</i>

49:13.033 --> 49:15.494
<i>I was afraid the men</i>
<i>would lose focus,</i>

49:15.577 --> 49:17.329
<i>suffer a drop</i>
<i>in morale.</i>

49:17.412 --> 49:20.832
<i>And that was dangerous,</i>
<i>especially in combat.</i>

49:20.916 --> 49:22.709
<i>More of which lay</i>
<i>in store for us.</i>

49:23.794 --> 49:25.879
Perconte.

49:23.794 --> 49:25.879
Hey.

49:25.962 --> 49:27.881
Lipton:
<i>We'd cleared the woods</i>
<i>east and west of Foy.</i>

49:27.964 --> 49:29.758
<i>Now it was time</i>
<i>for the inevitable assault</i>

49:29.841 --> 49:31.259
<i>on Foy, itself.</i>

49:32.135 --> 49:33.512
<i>Frankly,</i>
<i>I was dreading it.</i>

49:33.595 --> 49:35.889
<i>I always knew</i>
<i>the "E" Company men</i>
<i>who trained at Toccoa</i>

49:35.972 --> 49:37.849
<i>wouldn't get through</i>
<i>the war unscathed,</i>

49:37.933 --> 49:39.184
<i>but now I was</i>
<i>beginning to wonder</i>

49:39.267 --> 49:41.103
<i>if any of us were gonna</i>
<i>make it through at all.</i>

49:42.104 --> 49:42.979
Hey, Lieb.

49:43.063 --> 49:44.773
<i>"E" Company</i>
<i>would lead the attack.</i>

49:44.856 --> 49:47.025
<i>The problem was,</i>
<i>at least in my estimation,</i>

49:47.109 --> 49:49.236
<i>"E" Company still</i>
<i>did not have a leader.</i>

49:54.825 --> 49:57.119
(shouting in German)

50:01.623 --> 50:02.791
<i>The night before the attack,</i>

50:02.874 --> 50:04.209
<i>I did something</i>
<i>as 1st Sergeant,</i>

50:04.292 --> 50:06.670
<i>I would never have</i>
<i>imagined myself doing.</i>

50:14.720 --> 50:15.887
Lip.

50:18.181 --> 50:21.017
Didn't figure you
for a smoking man.

50:18.181 --> 50:21.017
Neither did I.

50:26.148 --> 50:28.608
"D" Company,
Lieutenant Speirs,
patrol order.

50:31.319 --> 50:32.487
So...?

50:32.571 --> 50:35.365
We've been
watching Foy all day, sir,
not much activity.

50:35.449 --> 50:37.492
Want a coffee?

50:35.449 --> 50:37.492
No, thank you, sir.

50:40.662 --> 50:42.038
How's Easy's status?

50:42.122 --> 50:44.916
The men are good, sir,
they're prepared.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.835
I'm gonna be leading
2nd Platoon, tomorrow.

50:46.918 --> 50:49.087
They're probably
the weakest after losing Toye,

50:49.171 --> 50:52.799
and Guarnere,
and Muck, and Penkala.

50:52.883 --> 50:55.135
But all in all, I have every
confidence in the men, sir.

50:55.218 --> 50:56.386
Good.

51:01.725 --> 51:04.519
But, on the other hand,
I have no confidence
in our C.O., sir.

51:06.980 --> 51:09.941
Lieutenant Dike is
an empty uniform, Captain.

51:10.025 --> 51:11.151
He's just...

51:12.527 --> 51:13.945
He's not there, sir.

51:16.031 --> 51:17.407
Well, he's gonna
be there tomorrow.

51:17.491 --> 51:19.659
Yes, sir, I understand
he will be there physically.

51:20.827 --> 51:22.245
But tomorrow's
gonna be the real deal,

51:22.329 --> 51:25.624
and he's gonna
have to lead those men.

51:25.707 --> 51:27.876
He's gonna have to make
decisions, sir, and I...

51:29.419 --> 51:30.962
I gotta tell you, sir,
I think he's gonna get

51:31.046 --> 51:32.798
a lot of
Easy Company men killed.

51:37.969 --> 51:39.429
Thank you, Sergeant,
that'll be all.

51:39.513 --> 51:40.806
Yes, sir.

51:45.060 --> 51:46.561
Lipton:
<i>I said what I had to say.</i>

51:46.645 --> 51:48.647
<i>There was nothing</i>
<i>Winters could do.</i>

51:53.068 --> 51:55.487
<i>He couldn't very well</i>
<i>remove a company C.O.,</i>

51:55.570 --> 51:56.822
<i>especially</i>
<i>a well-connected one,</i>

51:56.905 --> 52:00.659
<i>because of the misgivings</i>
<i>of a company 1st Sergeant.</i>

52:00.742 --> 52:03.078
Winters: You've got
about an eighth of a mile
of open field to cross

52:03.161 --> 52:04.830
before we get down
here into Foy.

52:04.913 --> 52:06.957
There's very little cover,
so you've gotta move quickly.

52:07.040 --> 52:08.542
I've set up two sections
of light machine guns

52:08.625 --> 52:10.794
at either end, here.
They'll give you
covering fire.

52:10.877 --> 52:13.630
3rd Battalion will
led by "I" Company.rom the east,

52:13.713 --> 52:15.215
That should
cause distraction.

52:15.298 --> 52:17.217
"D" Company
will be in reserve,
but we shouldn't need 'em.

52:17.300 --> 52:19.886
The point is,
you gotta move in there fast.

52:19.970 --> 52:22.305
Get in there before
they can bring their mortars

52:22.389 --> 52:24.182
and artillery
down on you.

52:24.266 --> 52:26.518
Clear?

52:24.266 --> 52:26.518
Clear.

52:26.601 --> 52:29.396
I'm relying on you.
Get it done.

Foley, you take

you take your men
on a flanking mission

55:19.649 --> 55:22.027

55:51.139 --> 55:53.266
We go on a flanking run
'round the back
of the village,

55:53.349 --> 55:54.768
and we attack
from the rear.

55:54.851 --> 55:56.728
Ramirez, two guys,
take 'em, go.

55:56.811 --> 55:58.354
Find some cover
behind the stable.

55:58.438 --> 55:59.647
Go, go!

Perconte!

Give me some cover!

56:27.217 --> 56:28.968
How you doing,
Perconte?

56:29.052 --> 56:31.096

in my ass, Martin.

56:38.228 --> 56:39.395
The building

56:39.479 --> 56:41.064

the caved-in roof.

56:47.570 --> 56:50.281
Sir, we are
sitting ducks here.

56:50.365 --> 56:52.283

keep moving!

Godammit, you do not
go out there.

You're
the battalion commander.
Now get back here!

57:05.046 --> 57:07.173
Now, Dick, I understand your
attachment to Easy Company--

57:07.257 --> 57:09.884
Speirs, get yourself
over here!

57:09.968 --> 57:12.887
Get out there and relieve Dike
and take that attack on in.

57:17.058 --> 57:19.435
Webb, fall back,
you're too exposed.

57:23.148 --> 57:24.941

Let's go, kid.

57:33.324 --> 57:35.243
Lieutenant,
what are we doing?

57:38.705 --> 57:40.874
I'm taking over.
1st Sergeant Lipton!

57:40.957 --> 57:42.584
Here!

57:40.957 --> 57:42.584
What have we got?

57:42.667 --> 57:44.669
Sir, most of the company
is spread out here.

57:44.752 --> 57:46.838
1st Platoon
tried an end around
but they're stretched out,

57:46.921 --> 57:48.298

by a sniper.

57:48.381 --> 57:50.550
I believe he's in the building
with the caved-in roof.

57:50.633 --> 57:52.177

and grenade launchers

57:52.260 --> 57:53.386

'till it's gone.

57:53.469 --> 57:54.971
