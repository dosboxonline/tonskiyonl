WEBVTT

00:51.802 --> 00:53.679
I'll take this.

00:53.721 --> 00:54.722
Merci.

01:10.446 --> 01:12.573
Sorry about all the...

01:12.615 --> 01:14.200
Oh, don't be stupid.
You did us a favor.

01:19.538 --> 01:20.623
What are we gonna do with him?

01:20.664 --> 01:22.166
Ah, we'll take care of it.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.088
The-the, uh, tracking chip.

01:28.130 --> 01:29.381
FRENCHIE:
Already disabled.

01:29.423 --> 01:32.635
Sit down and relax,
Petit Hughie.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.607
Oi, where you think
you're going?

01:46.649 --> 01:47.691
I'm going home.
I need clothes.

01:47.733 --> 01:48.859
We'll get you clothes.

01:48.901 --> 01:51.028
I want my clothes.

01:51.070 --> 01:53.280
I'll be right back.

01:53.322 --> 01:56.826
You are, perhaps...
in a state of shock, mon ami.

01:56.867 --> 01:59.245
Hughie, you just arse-bombed
America's sweetheart.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.413
You can't just piss off.

02:03.833 --> 02:06.126
I need to go home.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.843
All right.
Frenchie will go with you.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.970
Wait, what? No.

02:16.011 --> 02:19.723
Either he goes with you,
or I break your legs.

02:23.227 --> 02:25.437
Good lad.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.570
Translucent's skin,
it won't burn off.

02:32.611 --> 02:35.364
Where you gonna stash it
Homelander can't find it?

02:35.406 --> 02:38.033
Nowhere.

02:38.075 --> 02:40.160
But we can slow the cunt down
a bit.

02:43.539 --> 02:45.583

03:33.213 --> 03:34.632
Come on in.

03:38.510 --> 03:41.972
Ms. Stillwell. Hello.

03:42.014 --> 03:43.265
Please sit.

03:43.307 --> 03:45.309
(clears throat)

03:51.357 --> 03:55.361
Starlight, that video.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.196
-Ms. Stillwell, please.
-No, no. Let me finish.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.240
The date-rape girl? The victim?

04:00.282 --> 04:01.992
She saw that video on YouTube

04:02.034 --> 04:04.662
and she came forward
to thank you.

04:04.703 --> 04:07.414
She could not have been
more effusive.

04:07.456 --> 04:12.419
That's... that's good, right?

04:12.461 --> 04:15.631
It is fantastic.
You're polling through the roof.

04:15.673 --> 04:18.926
You have a huge boost with men--
for the ass-kicking, of course--

04:18.968 --> 04:21.553
but with women, too.
They love the empowerment.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.514
16 points with females 18 to 49,

04:23.555 --> 04:26.433
even in the liberal
retreat jurisdictions

04:26.475 --> 04:28.978
like New York and San Francisco.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.772
-I don't know what to say.
-You just have to enjoy this.

04:31.814 --> 04:35.901
This is so good for you.
And it's so great for us,

04:35.943 --> 04:37.903
because it is
a partnership, after all.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.989
-This is Seth and Evan
from marketing.
-Hi.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.824
They have some brilliant ideas
on how to capitalize

04:41.865 --> 04:44.284
on all the buzz. Gentlemen.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.453
-(quietly): Okay. So...
-Yeah.

04:46.495 --> 04:50.499
Now, small-town Iowa girl,
unexpected child prodigy,

04:50.541 --> 04:52.584

LAMBERT: Destiny knocks
on the girl next door's door,

04:55.295 --> 04:58.257
and she answers,
to fight for truth and justice

04:58.298 --> 05:01.218
-side by side with her heroes.
-The Big Apple is rough, tumble.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.430
It's got worms. Muggers
and rapists and thieves, oh, my.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.765
Dorothy is not
in Kansas anymore.

05:06.807 --> 05:10.227
Or Iowa. Poor girl gets knocked
around something fierce.

05:10.269 --> 05:13.355
-Kicked while she's down.
-So what does she do?
Does she cry in her milk?

05:13.397 --> 05:15.232
-Does she quit?
-No way!

05:15.274 --> 05:17.651
-(mouths)
-She adapts! She transforms!

05:17.693 --> 05:19.069
LAMBERT:
Embraces her feminine strengths.

05:19.111 --> 05:20.237
REED:
Good-bye, Yellow Brick Road...

05:20.320 --> 05:22.740
And hello, Starlight.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.622
I can't wear that.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.332
What?

05:32.374 --> 05:33.917
Why not? It's beautiful.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.627
Seriously?

05:35.669 --> 05:39.006
I-It's just...

05:39.048 --> 05:41.216
It's not me.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.844
ISADORA:
I designed Homelander's suit.

05:43.886 --> 05:46.013
-This isn't my first rodeo.
-REED: You're wrong.

05:46.055 --> 05:48.891
It's totally you. It's bold,
it's brave, it's feminist.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.310
-How is that feminist?
-LAMBERT: Empowering.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.812
It says you're confident
in your own skin,

05:53.854 --> 05:55.230
and you're not afraid
to show it.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.941
Most importantly,
it tells the story.

05:57.983 --> 06:02.404
Of your transformation, of...
of what you're going through.

06:02.446 --> 06:06.992
How exactly do you know what
I'm going through, exactly?

06:07.034 --> 06:09.244
I'm sorry.

06:09.286 --> 06:11.663
I-I appreciate the effort,

06:11.705 --> 06:15.709
I really do,
but I'm fine with my old outfit.

06:15.751 --> 06:17.586
-We're not.
-Excuse me?

06:17.628 --> 06:20.798
Starlight, like I said before,
this is a partnership.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.258
In a partnership, there is give
and there is take.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.260
It's my body.

06:25.302 --> 06:28.263
I have the right to choose
how much of it I show.

06:28.305 --> 06:31.266
That is true. You do.

06:31.308 --> 06:34.353
You just won't be doing it
in The Seven,

06:34.394 --> 06:37.397
unless it is wrapped in that.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.614
REPORTER: Tomorrow,
A-Train versus Shockwave.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.407

06:47.449 --> 06:50.327
The question now, Al,
is can A-Train keep his title

06:50.369 --> 06:51.954
as the fastest man alive?

06:51.995 --> 06:54.164
Or is tomorrow the day
he runs out of track

06:54.206 --> 06:56.416
at the hands of this
fresh-faced young challenger?

06:56.458 --> 06:58.043
Just wait here, okay?

06:58.085 --> 06:59.461
REPORTER 2:
Tomorrow, live on pay-per-view,

06:59.503 --> 07:01.130

Well, Shockwave...

Oh, hey, Dad.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.222
Wh-- look at the,

08:33.263 --> 08:35.557
-you-you've, this is...
-Yeah, yeah,
I'm sorry about this.

08:35.599 --> 08:39.144
I just, I've been meaning
to clean up the Supe stuff

08:39.186 --> 08:40.562
for a while now, so...

08:43.523 --> 08:45.150
What, are you going somewhere?

08:45.192 --> 08:47.486
-Yeah. For a while.
-Where?

08:47.527 --> 08:50.656
Uh, I don't know.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.492
Well, now,
you're scaring me, Hugh.

08:53.533 --> 08:57.412
All right, now,
I-I spoke to Dr. Feldman...

08:57.454 --> 08:59.831
-My pediatrician?
-He's still your doctor.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.875
And he's given me the name of
someone you can-you can talk to.

09:01.917 --> 09:04.503
Help you, you know,
get back to normal.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.339
There's no normal anymore.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.216
What do you mean,
there's... Look.

09:09.258 --> 09:12.219
We've always been very open
with each other, right?

09:12.261 --> 09:14.388
We-We've always told
each other everything.

09:14.429 --> 09:15.806
-Talk to me.
-Stop it.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.933
-What do you mean, stop it?
-Stop it.

09:17.975 --> 09:21.019
I have never told you
everything.

09:21.061 --> 09:24.398
I have never told you how much
I hate sitting on that couch,

09:24.439 --> 09:26.650
staring at the TV
like we're already dead.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.320
How much I fucking hate
Pizza Rolls.

09:30.362 --> 09:33.156
-No, you love Pizza Rolls.
-When I was seven!

09:34.866 --> 09:36.868
I am not seven.

09:48.714 --> 09:50.716
I'm sorry.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.447
My father was bipolar.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.868
One night, when I was ten,

10:17.909 --> 10:20.620
he tried to smother me
with a Hello Kitty duvet.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.637
(siren wailing in distance)

10:40.098 --> 10:42.601
(shouting in distance)

10:42.642 --> 10:45.020
-PRISONER: Give him that work!
-Kick his ass!

10:50.567 --> 10:52.569
MOTHER'S MILK:
Yo!

10:57.115 --> 10:59.076
What the hell
is wrong with y'all?

10:59.117 --> 11:01.620
This is not
what we do here, gentlemen.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.122
Now, didn't I tell you,
we take turns at the pong?

11:04.164 --> 11:08.585
Oslo, Deeaygo, tell me you
put your names up on my board?

11:08.627 --> 11:09.961
Apologies, Mr. Milk. No, sir.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.547
Nuh-uh, me, neither, Mr. Milk.

11:12.589 --> 11:13.882
Which means
that you have cut in line

11:13.924 --> 11:15.884
in front of everybody else
in here.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.761
What else does it mean?
Come on, spit it out.

11:17.803 --> 11:19.638
Means that we're disrespecting
all the other niggas...

11:19.679 --> 11:20.889
Excuse me?

11:20.931 --> 11:23.350
All our fellow brothers
in the unit.

11:23.392 --> 11:24.976
Now, you both know how to write

11:25.018 --> 11:27.229
in the English language
in a passable fashion.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.231
I know that, 'cause I've seen
to it myself, have I not?

11:29.272 --> 11:32.067
-Yes, sir.
-Then please, place your
John Hancocks on my board.

11:32.109 --> 11:34.569
Yes sir, Mr. Milk. Thank you.

11:34.611 --> 11:37.030
At the bottom of the list.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.164
Oh, hell nah.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.375
What the fuck do you want?

11:48.417 --> 11:50.544
What, I can't visit me old mate?

11:50.585 --> 11:52.754
Rekindle the unbreakable bonds
of brothers-in-arms?

11:52.796 --> 11:55.173
-Nope.
-Come on, M.M.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.551
Bring it in.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.678
Look, if it's all the same,
let's just cut the small talk.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.389
All you're gonna do is lie
and say how you're doing fine,

12:02.431 --> 12:04.808
and I'm gonna lie and pretend
like I'm happy to see you.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.476
Why are you here?

12:08.937 --> 12:12.691
All right.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.402
-How'd you like to come back,
have another go?
-Mm-mm.

12:15.444 --> 12:17.946
No, sir. Keep it to yourself.

12:17.988 --> 12:21.533
I don't want to know nothing
about nothing.

12:21.575 --> 12:25.078
I'm a happy man now.
Life is good,

12:25.120 --> 12:27.789
-Monique is back,
we're good, just...
-Oh, yeah? How is Monique?

12:27.831 --> 12:29.791
Spits on the ground
every time your name comes up.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.294
I can't do that
to her again, man.

12:32.335 --> 12:35.464
Not to mention, I'm actually
making progress with these boys.

12:35.505 --> 12:36.756
Yeah, so I can see.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.842
(indistinct shouting)

12:40.093 --> 12:42.053
Don't make me come out there!

12:42.095 --> 12:44.556
Well, this is God's work.

12:44.598 --> 12:48.810
I can't argue with that.
But a man of your talents?

12:48.852 --> 12:51.438
-Wasted here.
-Look, Butcher,

12:51.480 --> 12:53.523
we were into some bad shit, man.

12:53.565 --> 12:57.360
Even before the Mallory stuff.
And that, that was...

12:57.402 --> 12:59.738
(sighs)

12:59.779 --> 13:01.490
If I'm gonna make a difference,

13:01.531 --> 13:04.201
I just feel more comfortable
doing it on a smaller scale.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.952
I'm a motherfucker with a heart.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.412
Whereas you?

13:09.080 --> 13:10.373
You're just a motherfucker.

13:15.170 --> 13:18.590
Funny you should mention
making a difference...

13:21.676 --> 13:24.262
...'cause we just dusted a Supe.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.181
Bullshit.

13:26.223 --> 13:27.807
Translucent.

13:29.518 --> 13:30.936
What the f...

13:33.271 --> 13:35.357
Well, come on,
you lime-sucking smart-ass.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.150
How the hell did you do it?

13:37.192 --> 13:40.779
Well...

13:40.820 --> 13:44.783
Big lump of C-4,
packed right up his fudger.

13:44.824 --> 13:48.703
Boom. Claret everywhere,
fucking diabolical.

13:48.745 --> 13:52.541
But before the fireworks,
he coughed up a solid lead.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.376
Spilled the beans in a big way.

13:54.417 --> 13:55.961
Now, we play this right,

13:56.002 --> 13:58.380
we could shake up
the whole hornets' nest,

13:58.421 --> 14:01.383
bring down Seven
and Vought at the same time.

14:01.424 --> 14:02.509
MOTHER'S MILK:
Mm-hmm.

14:02.551 --> 14:05.053
You mean do Homelander?

14:06.763 --> 14:08.181
(chuckles)

14:08.223 --> 14:10.308
This is about Becca, isn't it?

14:10.350 --> 14:12.894
It's always about Becca
with you.

14:12.936 --> 14:15.438
Oh, you ain't got your reasons?

14:17.857 --> 14:19.818
(sighs)

14:19.859 --> 14:22.028
It'll be different this go,
all right?

14:22.070 --> 14:24.322
None of that
"secrets and lies" bollocks.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.741
And that Mallory shit
ain't gonna happen this time.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.827
I swear to God.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.333
Are you bringing Frenchie back?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.794
'Cause I can't work
with that motherfucker.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.297
Frenchie?
No, I ain't seen him in years.

14:42.799 --> 14:45.010
M.M., you're the only bloke
I can trust.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.428
(chuckles)

14:46.469 --> 14:49.347
Since when
have you ever trusted anybody?

14:50.599 --> 14:52.559
Oh, fuck.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.644
CHUCK TODD: Senator Calhoun,
you've gone on the record

14:54.686 --> 14:56.313
-against superheroes
in the military.
-MADELYN: Who's a good boy?

14:56.354 --> 14:57.814
-Who's a good boy?
-Why change your tune?

14:57.856 --> 14:59.482
No one's changing their tune.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.359
Uh, it's just I realized that

15:01.401 --> 15:04.154
-it's an issue
that affects all Americans.
-(Teddy babbling)

15:04.195 --> 15:07.073
-Can't you make it... stop?
-It shouldn't be decided
by a few congressmen

15:07.115 --> 15:08.450
-hidden in committee.
-He's not crying.

15:08.491 --> 15:09.826
The bill needs to go
to the floor.

15:09.868 --> 15:10.869
Oh, okay.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.203
Aw. Aw.
(gasps)

15:12.245 --> 15:13.872
Oh, no. We can't have that...

15:13.913 --> 15:17.167
You know, I heard Translucent's
tracking chip went dead.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.961
-Yeah?
-He could be hurt.

15:20.003 --> 15:20.962
(chuckles)
How?

15:21.004 --> 15:22.297
He's got diamond skin.

15:22.339 --> 15:23.632
He's gonna be fine.

15:23.673 --> 15:24.924
My guys are on it.

15:24.966 --> 15:26.926
All right,
I forgot to give you these.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.136
Here.

15:28.178 --> 15:29.387
What is it?

15:29.429 --> 15:31.222
Those are
your new talking points.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.142
Now that the military bill
is out of committee,

15:34.184 --> 15:36.770
corporate wants
to sell the shit out of it.

15:36.811 --> 15:38.730
Yes. They do.

15:38.772 --> 15:41.316
(giggling)

15:41.358 --> 15:44.736
Hey. Y-You remember when
you wanted me in the red cape

15:44.778 --> 15:46.655
and-and I said,
"No. No, no, no.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.990
Make it the flag"?
Remember that?

15:49.032 --> 15:50.992
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah. I don't need these.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.994
Okay?

15:53.036 --> 15:55.163
I can sell my way
into the military.

15:55.205 --> 15:57.248
-(paper crumpling)
-Thank you.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.876
You take care of your baby,
and I'll take care of mine.

15:59.918 --> 16:03.046
Mr. Edgar wrote
those personally.

16:03.088 --> 16:06.800
So if you want to go to 82
and take it up with him,

16:06.841 --> 16:08.843
be my guest.

16:11.096 --> 16:12.305
(quietly):
Oh, yes.

16:12.347 --> 16:13.973
Oh, you're a happy boy now, huh?

16:14.015 --> 16:15.934
Are you a happy boy?

16:15.975 --> 16:18.895
(paper rustling)

16:23.942 --> 16:26.319
MOTHER'S MILK:
A rental, you cheap bastard?

16:26.361 --> 16:28.321
BUTCHER: Who do you think I am,
some double-O wanker?

16:28.363 --> 16:31.491
In case you hadn't noticed,
we ain't exactly rolling in it.

16:31.533 --> 16:33.827
And you don't think
this is conspicuous?

16:33.868 --> 16:35.370
BUTCHER:
Conspicuous? No, I don't think

16:35.412 --> 16:37.539
it's conspicuous.
I think a big black van

16:37.580 --> 16:40.291
with fucking "Flowers"
on the side is conspicuous.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.545
This is just another truck
on the street.

16:43.586 --> 16:46.756
(rhythmic knocking)

16:46.798 --> 16:48.800
Bang on time.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.516
Uh, hi.

16:56.558 --> 16:59.018
Hughie.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.687
-(speaks French)
-Smelly motherfucker.

17:02.063 --> 17:05.567
(overlapping shouting)

17:05.608 --> 17:07.485
-Butcher, who is this guy?!
-You'll give the game away!

17:07.527 --> 17:09.154
Not until this frog gets
what's coming.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.655
Only thing that is coming

17:10.697 --> 17:13.241
-is me on your mother's titties!
-Let me through at him, bitch!

17:13.283 --> 17:14.743
-Hey!
-We had an agreement about him.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.161
We agreed to put a pin in it,
all right?

17:16.202 --> 17:17.746
-What agreement?
-There was no pin.

17:17.787 --> 17:18.997
I don't trust this French whore.

17:19.038 --> 17:19.998
I am more American than you,

17:20.039 --> 17:21.791
you racist piece of shit!

17:21.833 --> 17:23.626
-Why are they fighting?!
-Nothing. It is water
under the bridge.

17:23.668 --> 17:25.170
You tell that
to Mallory's grandkids.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.672
Tell them it's water
under the bridge.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.383
-That wasn't my fault, huh?
-Who is Mallory?

17:30.425 --> 17:32.802
All right, the both of you,
knock it on the head, now!

17:32.844 --> 17:35.764
(ringtone playing):
♪ Never gonna give you up ♪

17:35.805 --> 17:37.515
♪ Never gonna let you down ♪

17:37.557 --> 17:39.350
♪ Never gonna run around ♪

17:39.392 --> 17:41.936
-Shit!
-♪ And desert you ♪

17:41.978 --> 17:43.938
♪ Never gonna make you cry ♪

17:43.980 --> 17:46.107

17:46.149 --> 17:47.817

17:47.859 --> 17:49.819
(phone beeps)

17:49.861 --> 17:51.821
Hey, Monique.

17:51.863 --> 17:54.157
How you doing, baby?

17:54.199 --> 17:56.910
Ooh, I forgot to marinade
the tilapia.

17:56.951 --> 17:59.412
I am so sorry, sweetheart.

17:59.454 --> 18:01.539
Okay, how 'bout this?

18:01.581 --> 18:04.167
How about,
on my way home from work,

18:04.209 --> 18:06.669
I stop by DeLuca's,
pick up two fat tenderloins,

18:06.711 --> 18:09.047
some portobello mushrooms, that
pinot that you love so much.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.799
Yeah, baby.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.801
Okay, I-I got to go.

18:12.842 --> 18:14.219
All right, sweetheart.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.137
Yeah. Me, too.

18:16.179 --> 18:18.306
Baby, I just--

18:18.348 --> 18:20.058
Uh, you're right, you're right.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.559
I love you, too.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.603
Okay. Bye.

18:24.854 --> 18:27.398
-(kissing)
-(laughing)

18:30.401 --> 18:32.821
(laughing)

18:34.489 --> 18:36.783
Fuck all of y'all, okay?

18:36.825 --> 18:38.368
(blows out lips)

18:38.409 --> 18:40.286
All right. All right.

18:40.328 --> 18:43.748
Listen, you two knobbers
kiss and make up, yeah?

18:43.790 --> 18:45.583
We got a fucking job to do.

18:46.501 --> 18:49.003
Fuck it. Dégage, huh?

18:49.045 --> 18:51.089
-(kissing)
-Get out of here.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.799
Who's this guy?

18:52.841 --> 18:54.217
The new lad. Hughie.

18:54.259 --> 18:56.135
Hughie, Mother's Milk.

18:56.177 --> 18:58.471
That's a... nickname?

18:58.513 --> 19:00.974
No, my mother actually named me
Mother's Milk.

19:01.015 --> 19:03.268
-Did-did she?
-So we got

19:03.309 --> 19:05.019
a French whore
and a Stephen fucking Hawking.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.688
-Great job, Butcher.
-Well, it was

19:06.729 --> 19:09.315
Stephen fucking Hawking
who dusted the Supe.

19:10.775 --> 19:11.776
Oh.

19:12.819 --> 19:13.778
She's home.

19:13.820 --> 19:14.946
HUGHIE:
That's Popclaw, right?

19:14.988 --> 19:16.155
A-Train's girlfriend?

19:19.409 --> 19:21.327
Oh, Popclaw. Hi.

19:21.369 --> 19:22.704
Uh, you know the-the rent?

19:22.745 --> 19:26.082
-It was due last week.
-Right. Of course.

19:26.124 --> 19:27.458
MOTHER'S MILK: You think her
and A-Train are, uh...

19:27.500 --> 19:29.252
BUTCHER:
Yeah, playing bury the bishop.

19:29.294 --> 19:31.129
Didn't hear nothing about it.
I'm usually up on these things.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.463
BUTCHER:
According to Translucent,

19:32.505 --> 19:34.716
A-Train knows this bird
inside out.

19:34.757 --> 19:35.925
I'll drop the check off ASAP.

19:35.967 --> 19:37.594
-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.053
-Yeah.
-'Kay.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.977
BUTCHER: All right.
Let's get the bugs sorted,

19:46.019 --> 19:47.562
see for ourselves.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.235
Where-Where'd you get this shit,
Circuit City?

19:54.277 --> 19:57.155
Right? He's a cheap bastard.

19:59.616 --> 20:03.411
You know, we don't actually need
to sneak in anything.

20:03.453 --> 20:06.581
-Eh?
-Look, all I need's
her IPv6 number.

20:06.623 --> 20:09.876
Every desktop, every smart TV
in the house has a camera on it.

20:09.918 --> 20:11.169
They probably have one
in every room.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.379
-Even in the toilet?
-No, Frenchie,

20:13.421 --> 20:15.006
not in the toilet. Look,
I just need five minutes inside.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.216
I mean, home service
is my specialty.

20:24.182 --> 20:26.142
Hello, ma'am,
we're with Bryman Audio-Visual.

20:26.184 --> 20:28.978
We got the new router. I'm...

20:29.020 --> 20:31.397
This is-is Hughie.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.274
I'm Gary.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.193
-I didn't make an appointment.
-Oh, well, your manager did.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.320
-He's upgrading
the whole building.
-I just saw

20:37.362 --> 20:39.072
my landlord.
He didn't mention it.

20:39.113 --> 20:41.824
I've got a work order
right here, ma'am.

20:41.866 --> 20:44.661
HUGHIE:
Only takes a second.

20:44.702 --> 20:47.372
And we can get you all the way
up to a thousand Mbps.

20:47.413 --> 20:48.998
That-That's a lot.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.833
Okay. Come on in.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.549
-(door closes)
-The computer's right over here

20:58.591 --> 21:00.969
-if you need it.
-Uh, yeah.

21:01.010 --> 21:02.387
I just need
to sign on to your server

21:02.428 --> 21:04.138
in order to download
the service package.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.349
-Yeah, sure.
-I have a confession.

21:06.391 --> 21:08.226
We're really big fans. I mean,

21:08.267 --> 21:09.477
Terminal Beauty 3...

21:09.519 --> 21:11.646
Whew. Damn.

21:11.688 --> 21:14.065
Oh. Thanks.

21:14.107 --> 21:17.402
Yeah, that one
really came together.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.612
Let me know
if you guys need anything else.

21:19.654 --> 21:21.656
Thank you.

21:38.172 --> 21:40.216
You gonna eye-fuck that all day?

21:40.258 --> 21:42.510
Let's go.

21:49.267 --> 21:51.853
(keys clacking)

21:53.771 --> 21:55.189
Hmm.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.066
What is it?

21:57.108 --> 21:58.651
Nothing.

21:59.944 --> 22:01.946
(exhales)

22:09.537 --> 22:11.622
(chuckles)

22:20.882 --> 22:23.009
This kid is full of surprises.

22:23.051 --> 22:25.094
HUGHIE:
Okay, ma'am, all done.

22:25.136 --> 22:26.512
(exhales)

22:26.554 --> 22:27.847
Thank you, guys.

22:27.889 --> 22:30.016
Thank you.

22:30.058 --> 22:31.517
MOTHER'S MILK:
Get your John Hancock?

22:31.559 --> 22:33.144
-POPCLAW: Oh, sure.
-Thank you.

22:33.186 --> 22:34.479
(exhales)

22:34.520 --> 22:37.356
Ooh. Excuse me, bud.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.369
What, you want a...
autograph or something?

23:01.089 --> 23:02.965
Haven't we met before?

23:08.387 --> 23:09.680
Maybe.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.599
I meet a ton of people.

23:11.641 --> 23:13.434
Come on, man.
My meter's running out.

23:13.476 --> 23:15.394
Let's go.
Let's get out of here.

23:15.436 --> 23:17.772
-Excuse us, brother.
-Yeah.

23:21.067 --> 23:24.362
You trying to get us killed?

23:27.365 --> 23:30.076
(grunting)

23:50.721 --> 23:53.182
-(phone ringing)
-(grunting)

23:57.937 --> 24:00.565
Yeah.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.233
(sighs)

24:02.275 --> 24:04.402
I'll be right there.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.237
Look, Translucent's
probably just lurking

24:06.279 --> 24:08.072
around a gynecologist's office
or something.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.490
-For two days? Come on.
-(gunfire in distance)

24:09.532 --> 24:10.741
I don't get it.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.451
Why is no one concerned
about this?

24:12.493 --> 24:14.745
Because if people find out
one of the Seven is missing,

24:14.787 --> 24:16.289
they panic.

24:16.330 --> 24:19.292
Besides, you can't fucking stand
Translucent.

24:19.333 --> 24:21.669
-Give 'em hell, Homelander!
-Yeah, you bet, pal.

24:21.711 --> 24:23.671
Of course. But if something's
happened to him,

24:23.713 --> 24:25.673
then that's a direct attack
on the Seven,

24:25.715 --> 24:27.758
which is a direct attack on me.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.177
You've managed
to make this about you

24:29.218 --> 24:30.595
in less than 20 seconds flat.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.430
Hey, I'm not the one who's down
a point and a half.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.098
So I think
what you mean to say is,

24:34.140 --> 24:35.766
"Gee, thanks, Homelander,

24:35.808 --> 24:37.268
"for showing up out of the blue

24:37.310 --> 24:38.728
and bringing the extra press
to my collar."

24:38.769 --> 24:40.813
Homelander. Maeve.

24:40.855 --> 24:44.150
Captain, you guys
are the real heroes.

24:44.192 --> 24:46.444
-We're just glad we can help,
right?
-That's right.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.571
-Where's your shooter?
-Shooter's on 31.

24:48.613 --> 24:49.780
All right. Sit tight.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.368
(sighs)

24:54.410 --> 24:56.078
Elevators?

24:56.120 --> 24:58.122
(elevator bell dings)

24:59.874 --> 25:01.918
I'm just saying,
a missing team member

25:01.959 --> 25:05.087
is more important
than A-Train's insipid race.

25:05.129 --> 25:07.590
(sighs) Mr. Edgar
wants us both at the race

25:07.632 --> 25:09.342
to roll out
his new talking points.

25:09.383 --> 25:10.468
You know this.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.553
I've X-rayed Edgar, you know.

25:12.595 --> 25:14.889
He is this close to a coronary.

25:14.931 --> 25:16.891
He's got blood like engine oil.

25:16.933 --> 25:19.977
And Stillwell,
with that mewling baby--

25:20.019 --> 25:21.812
it's ridiculous.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.648
They're just people.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.650
But they snap their fingers
and we jump.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.401
-Why? Why do we do that?
-(sighs)

25:27.443 --> 25:29.946
-'Cause they sign our checks.
-(muffled gunfire)

25:29.987 --> 25:31.155
Can we just cut to the part

25:31.197 --> 25:34.158
where you show up to the race
anyway?

25:34.200 --> 25:35.743
(chuckles)

25:35.785 --> 25:37.620
See, that's why I love you.

25:38.663 --> 25:40.790
You're the only one

25:40.831 --> 25:42.750
who tells me the truth.

25:42.792 --> 25:45.670
(clanging)

25:45.711 --> 25:48.422
(grunting)

25:50.841 --> 25:52.718
Mm-mm.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.015
(choking)

25:58.057 --> 26:00.851
(shushing)

26:02.979 --> 26:04.814
(whispers):
It's all over.

26:04.855 --> 26:07.316
(man choking,
Homelander shushing)

26:07.358 --> 26:09.777
(whispers):
It's all over now.

26:09.819 --> 26:11.737
There you go.

26:22.039 --> 26:24.458
Goddamn it.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.675
That was my collar.

26:32.717 --> 26:34.677
Eh, it still is.

26:34.719 --> 26:37.638
Yeah, well, I can't walk him
on The Today Show like that.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.390
(chuckles)
No, that's true.

26:39.432 --> 26:40.933
I got excited.

26:40.975 --> 26:42.310
I'm sorry.

26:42.351 --> 26:44.186
-I'm sure you are.
-(whistles)

26:44.228 --> 26:45.187
You know the drill.

26:45.229 --> 26:46.647
He shot at us first.

26:49.525 --> 26:51.193
Attagirl.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.367
(blows, chuckles)

27:01.203 --> 27:02.913
The things I let you do to me.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.165
Yeah.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.708
We're not even dating anymore.

27:14.717 --> 27:16.594
(quietly):
Fuck.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.346
(moaning)

27:18.387 --> 27:20.723
(panting)

27:21.974 --> 27:25.227
(chuckles, hisses)

27:25.269 --> 27:27.146
Want me to do the thing?

27:27.188 --> 27:29.607
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.442
Okay.

27:33.861 --> 27:36.864
POPCLAW:
That's a good boy.

27:40.534 --> 27:42.703
Mmm.

27:47.792 --> 27:51.212
(sighs)

27:51.253 --> 27:53.339
Oh, stop. Stop, stop.

27:53.381 --> 27:55.758
(laughs)
Tickles. Tickling.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.721
What's the problem?

28:00.763 --> 28:02.807
Shockwave's the problem.

28:02.848 --> 28:04.266
What if I lose?

28:04.308 --> 28:06.060
You're not gonna lose.

28:06.102 --> 28:08.229
You're the fastest man alive.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.064
Until I'm not.

28:10.106 --> 28:12.108
You know what Stillwell told me?

28:12.149 --> 28:13.651
If I don't win, I'm out.

28:13.692 --> 28:17.405
Nobody wants the second
fastest man in The Seven.

28:21.659 --> 28:23.702
Babe.

28:27.081 --> 28:30.209
Compound V. Where'd you put it?

28:30.251 --> 28:34.004
POPCLAW: Oh, you sure, babe?
I mean, that stuff, it...

28:34.046 --> 28:36.465
amps you up something fierce.

28:36.507 --> 28:37.842
Remember last time?

28:37.883 --> 28:39.760
Last time's not gonna
happen again.

28:39.802 --> 28:42.930
I'm under control. Uh...

28:42.972 --> 28:45.683
You ran through a girl, baby.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.936
That's not what
I would call "control."

28:48.978 --> 28:51.689
That shit's a slippery slope.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.524
Take it from me.

28:53.566 --> 28:55.526
No, I... I need it.

28:55.568 --> 28:58.404
POPCLAW: Honey, I'll still
love you even if you lose.

28:58.446 --> 29:00.906
How is that supposed
to help me right now?

29:00.948 --> 29:04.618
-Uh...
-I have to win this thing.

29:04.660 --> 29:07.163
I don't want to be
some washed up B-squader.

29:07.204 --> 29:09.582
Like me?

29:09.623 --> 29:11.125
No, not like... That's...

29:13.669 --> 29:16.297
(A-Train sighs)

29:17.339 --> 29:19.133
I got to go.

29:19.175 --> 29:22.219
Why don't you just tell me
where the V is, please?

29:22.261 --> 29:24.972
I'll come back to see you
tomorrow after the race.

29:26.015 --> 29:28.184
What are you talking about?

29:30.186 --> 29:32.021
I've been meaning to tell you.

29:32.062 --> 29:34.523
Are you kidding me?

29:34.565 --> 29:37.818
I have been getting my hair
done, threading my eyebrows,

29:37.860 --> 29:40.738
waxing my body
like a plucked chicken,

29:40.779 --> 29:43.741
so that we could finally
stand up there together tomorrow

29:43.782 --> 29:45.826
in front of the world
as a couple.

29:45.868 --> 29:48.621
I mean, it was all cleared
with Stillwell and everything.

29:49.830 --> 29:51.832
A-TRAIN:
Um...

29:52.833 --> 29:54.877
You did clear it with Stillwell.

29:54.919 --> 29:58.214
Look, our time is gonna come,
I promise,

29:58.255 --> 30:00.674
but I got to get
my leverage back first.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.220
Where's the V?

30:10.559 --> 30:13.062
-What the hell is Compound V?
-MOTHER'S MILK: Sounds like

30:13.103 --> 30:14.772
some kind
of performance enhancer.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.107
-Steroids for Supes?
-Yeah. Well, whatever it was,

30:17.149 --> 30:19.401
he was juiced on it
when he murdered Robin.

30:38.128 --> 30:40.089
(sniffles)

30:40.130 --> 30:41.382
What are you grinning at?

30:41.423 --> 30:43.133
Oh, I don't know, mate.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.678
Maybe it's 'cause
The Seven might just be a squad

30:45.719 --> 30:48.305
of manky 'roid heads.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.766
Now this is exactly the kind
of malfeasance that Langley

30:50.808 --> 30:52.309
is gonna eat up by the spoonful.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.937
Not until we're sure
it does what we think it does.

30:54.979 --> 30:57.022
If we get a bit,
can you work it out?

30:57.064 --> 30:58.816
FRENCHIE:
Oh, I can run some tests,
of course.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.193
But there's no way of knowing
unless I try some myself.

31:01.235 --> 31:02.778
Amazing idea.

31:02.820 --> 31:04.363
BUTCHER:
We'll cross that bridge
when we burn it.

31:04.405 --> 31:07.616
First of all...

31:07.658 --> 31:10.160
we got to get some.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.206
(crowd cheering)

31:34.852 --> 31:36.854
Here's your cover.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.481
You're a mild-mannered reporter.

31:39.523 --> 31:41.150
So, uh...

31:41.191 --> 31:45.571
Butcher tells me he met you,
what, a few days ago?

31:46.822 --> 31:49.074
Yeah.

31:49.116 --> 31:50.909
Yeah, that sounds right.

31:50.951 --> 31:53.579
I don't know.
I've kind of lost track of time.

31:53.621 --> 31:55.247
Talk about a baptism of fire.

31:55.289 --> 31:57.833
I'll mic you up here.

31:59.668 --> 32:02.212
-So, Translucent, huh?
-(indistinct voice over P.A.)

32:02.254 --> 32:05.924
How the fuck
did you pull that off?

32:07.926 --> 32:10.012
I don't know.
Just lucky, I guess.

32:10.054 --> 32:12.640
Still. Must have been scary.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.603
You want to know
what's really messed up?

32:17.645 --> 32:20.898
Is, uh...

32:20.939 --> 32:23.233
in some ways...

32:23.275 --> 32:25.903
just right in that moment, it...

32:25.944 --> 32:28.364
felt kind of good.

32:30.866 --> 32:32.660
It's written all over your face,
Hughie.

32:32.701 --> 32:34.912
What? How can you tell?

32:34.953 --> 32:37.915
'Cause I know
how this job makes me feel.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.626
When I had the detonator
in my hand, I felt, like, a...

32:40.668 --> 32:42.044
I felt, like, a rush.

32:42.086 --> 32:44.088
I get it.

32:44.129 --> 32:47.007
-Like I felt alive.
-But that rush, Hughie,

32:47.049 --> 32:49.593
is no different
than the shit A-Train shoots up.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.845
Everything comes with a price.

33:01.355 --> 33:04.066
The last thing
I ever said to Robin...

33:04.108 --> 33:08.946
was "Don't you ever
besmirch Billy Joel."

33:10.989 --> 33:13.242
That was the last thing
that she heard

33:13.283 --> 33:15.577
before she burst into pieces.

33:15.619 --> 33:19.540
And-and I got to live with that
shit for the rest of my life.

33:27.131 --> 33:29.133
The price?

33:30.676 --> 33:32.636
Whatever it is...

33:32.678 --> 33:34.763
I'll pay it.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.270
(dramatic theme music plays)

33:41.311 --> 33:45.441
ANNOUNCER: This...
is the Race of the Century.

33:46.942 --> 33:50.320
This... is our legacy
and our future.

33:50.362 --> 33:53.365
Athletes achieving
at the highest level.

33:55.451 --> 33:59.204
This is what we've waited for--
the showdown.

33:59.246 --> 34:02.666
These men are extremely
powerful and very, very quick.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.501
The Train is ready
to leave the station.

34:04.543 --> 34:08.338
He reaches speeds in excess
of 1,000 miles per hour.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.382
The fastest men in the world
are here in New York.

34:10.424 --> 34:12.593
Who will come out on top?
There he stands--

34:12.634 --> 34:15.304
six foot one,
but a stature that's such

34:15.345 --> 34:17.222
that he's a colossus
for the whole world.

34:23.645 --> 34:25.898
♪ I'll put his blood
in my veins ♪

34:25.939 --> 34:28.192
♪ Ring the alarms, right
until my very last breath ♪

34:28.233 --> 34:30.486

-All right, champ.
-A-TRAIN: Mmm.

34:32.529 --> 34:33.906
You got this?

34:33.947 --> 34:35.699
Yeah.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.743
Hey...

34:37.785 --> 34:41.872
Ma is looking down
on us both right now.

34:41.914 --> 34:44.750
Putting that wind at your back.

34:44.792 --> 34:46.877
Now, you got this?

34:46.919 --> 34:48.796
-I got this.
-That's what

34:48.837 --> 34:50.297
-I'm talking about!
-I got this. Yeah.

34:50.339 --> 34:52.466
-That's what I want to hear.
-All right.

34:56.011 --> 34:59.556
ANNOUNCER: Introducing
the newest member of The Seven--

34:59.598 --> 35:02.726
Starlight,
accompanied by Black Noir.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.686
(applause and cheering)

35:06.104 --> 35:08.398
MAEVE:
I'm tired of

35:08.440 --> 35:11.652
the red tape
and the deep-state bureaucrats.

35:11.693 --> 35:14.112
If the people want us
in the armed forces,

35:14.154 --> 35:16.657
the people can order Congress
to do it.

35:16.698 --> 35:20.410
-Am I right? Yes!
-(whooping, cheering, applause)

35:23.163 --> 35:25.374
(applause, cheering,
whooping)

35:28.710 --> 35:30.754
HOMELANDER:
Sorry I'm late.

35:30.796 --> 35:33.507
-You got room for one more?
-(both chuckle)

35:33.549 --> 35:35.592
Ravishing as ever, my sweet.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.970
Hey, who's ready to see a race?

35:38.011 --> 35:40.514
-Huh?
-(cheering)

35:40.556 --> 35:42.516
Let's hear it for my boy
A-Train.

35:42.558 --> 35:44.226
(chuckles)
All right.

35:44.268 --> 35:45.978
(under his breath):
You fucking cocksuckers.

35:46.019 --> 35:47.980
ANNOUNCER: Please remain
standing for the singing

35:48.021 --> 35:49.481
of our national anthem.

35:49.523 --> 35:52.317
(distant sound of crowd)

35:52.359 --> 35:55.863
Thank you for coming.
It was nice to meet you.

35:57.155 --> 36:00.075
(smacks lips)
Aren't you cute?

36:00.117 --> 36:03.745
Is it okay if I get a selfie?

36:03.787 --> 36:06.081
Of course, honey. Take this.

36:07.624 --> 36:09.835
(sighs, gasps)

36:09.877 --> 36:11.837
Look at you!

36:11.879 --> 36:13.922
You really dress the part.

36:13.964 --> 36:16.592
It's your old uniform, but
I'm saving up for the new one.

36:21.763 --> 36:23.515

36:31.565 --> 36:33.692
-Lean down a little bit more!
-(laughter)

36:33.734 --> 36:35.569
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

36:35.611 --> 36:38.363
You do not need to press
your luck right now, right?

36:38.405 --> 36:39.865
MAN 2:
Kick my ass, Starlight!

36:39.907 --> 36:42.993
Sweetie, you know what?
Save your money.

36:43.035 --> 36:45.120
I like that one much better.

36:48.457 --> 36:50.918
-Starlight?
-I need a minute.

36:50.959 --> 36:53.128

36:56.757 --> 36:59.176
-(cheering)

37:03.263 --> 37:05.140
Glad you made it.

37:05.182 --> 37:06.767
I had a feeling you might.

37:06.808 --> 37:10.479
Remember when used to just
fly off to Paris, like,

37:10.520 --> 37:12.648
-on a whim?
-Yeah, I remember

37:12.689 --> 37:14.232
freezing my ass off
across the Atlantic.

37:14.274 --> 37:16.026
Yeah, those were good times.

37:16.068 --> 37:18.570
Why did we ever break up?

37:18.612 --> 37:21.698
You mind if we not crack open
that tawdry little chapter?

37:21.740 --> 37:24.785
Oh, come on.

37:24.826 --> 37:26.328
(rhythmic clapping, cheering)

37:29.790 --> 37:31.750
You know...

37:31.792 --> 37:33.168
-MAN: Yeah, kiss her!

37:33.210 --> 37:34.795
-(crowd cheering)
-(Maeve giggles)

37:34.836 --> 37:37.673
If I ever really thought

37:37.714 --> 37:41.218
-that you'd fallen
for someone else...
-Mm.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.553
I just...
I don't think I could handle it.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.764
-Is that so?
-Yeah, you and me?

37:45.806 --> 37:47.099
-Mm.
-We're different.

37:47.140 --> 37:49.768
We're better.

-Together forever.

38:39.693 --> 38:42.029
All right, Frenchie, find it.
You're in the clear.

38:44.906 --> 38:46.366
MAN:
Starlight! Starlight!

38:46.408 --> 38:47.784
WOMAN:
Starlight!

38:47.826 --> 38:49.286
MAN:
Starlight, over here!

38:49.327 --> 38:51.413
(indistinct shouting)

38:51.455 --> 38:53.206
Annie?

38:53.248 --> 38:55.375
-MAN: I love your new outfit!
-(overlapping chatter)

38:55.417 --> 38:57.836
Annie? Annie!

38:57.878 --> 38:59.171
Annie? Hi!

38:59.212 --> 39:01.590
Hughie?

39:01.631 --> 39:03.008
From the bench the other day?

39:03.050 --> 39:06.303
You're, uh...
you're Starlight.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.597
That's...
How did I not realize that?

39:08.638 --> 39:10.932
It's actually kind of comforting
that you didn't.

39:10.974 --> 39:12.642
BUTCHER (over earpiece):
Fuckin' hell, Hughie.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.186
-You know Starlight?
-(clears throat)

39:14.227 --> 39:17.189
Well, Hughie, it was...

39:17.230 --> 39:18.982
It was really nice to see you,
but I should get going.

39:19.024 --> 39:21.651
-No, Hughie, we need more time.
-Can I, uh,

39:21.693 --> 39:23.320
buy you an overpriced beer?

39:23.361 --> 39:25.822
You know, if you've-you've...
if you got time.

39:28.283 --> 39:31.244
Throw in some overpriced nachos?

39:31.286 --> 39:34.664
-Lead the way.
-Okay.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.176
(panting)

39:46.218 --> 39:48.345
No V.
Must have hid it somewhere else.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.097
Fucking find it, Frenchie.

39:50.138 --> 39:52.307
This is just so weird.
I mean, the other day....

39:52.349 --> 39:54.059
-Was it three days ago?
-Mm-hmm.

39:54.101 --> 39:57.646
You just seemed, like...
You seemed so normal, you know?

39:57.687 --> 40:00.524
-And now, it's just...
-Now, I'm a freak.

40:00.565 --> 40:02.984
No. No, not at... No, that's not
what I meant at all.

40:03.026 --> 40:07.072
I just meant... I just...
I wasn't getting Beyoncé vibes,

40:07.114 --> 40:08.698
but... not that
you don't have that...

40:08.740 --> 40:11.201
-I'm messing with you.
-Okay.

40:15.997 --> 40:17.749
FRENCHIE:
Bad news.

40:17.791 --> 40:20.168
-No V.
-BUTCHER: Great. We're fucked.

40:20.210 --> 40:21.920
STARLIGHT:
No, it...

40:21.962 --> 40:23.797
It was really nice
to talk to someone

40:23.839 --> 40:26.842
who didn't know who I was.

40:26.883 --> 40:31.680
Once you're behind the scenes,
it's...

40:31.721 --> 40:35.058
-it's different.
-Like how?

40:35.100 --> 40:38.812
I don't know... if they really
want you to be a hero.

40:40.397 --> 40:42.440
I think they just want you
to look like one.

40:47.529 --> 40:49.739
(static)

40:49.781 --> 40:52.993
The other day on the bench
when you were talking

40:53.034 --> 40:55.829
about how much
you hated your job, you meant...

40:55.871 --> 40:57.497
you meant this job?

41:00.667 --> 41:02.878
Then, um...

41:05.297 --> 41:07.591
...just quit.

41:07.632 --> 41:09.259
Just walk away.

41:09.301 --> 41:11.386
I mean,
you got nothing to prove.

41:17.017 --> 41:19.019
I should probably get back,

41:19.060 --> 41:21.229
you know, before they send
a search party for me.

41:21.271 --> 41:23.815
-(chuckles) So...
-Yeah, totally. Um...

41:23.857 --> 41:26.943
listen, Annie-- Starlight.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.486
-What do you, uh...?
-Annie.

41:28.528 --> 41:32.282
Um, this is insane, but, uh...

41:32.324 --> 41:33.658
I know you're you
and everything,

41:33.700 --> 41:35.952
but if you ever
just wanted to...

41:35.994 --> 41:37.829
you know, get...

41:37.871 --> 41:39.873
Would you like my number?

41:43.001 --> 41:46.171
Yeah. Yeah, that's-that's, uh...

41:46.213 --> 41:48.173
that's what I was asking.

41:48.215 --> 41:50.425
-Okay.
-Do I call you,

41:50.467 --> 41:52.510
-or do I just commit a crime?
-Probably committing a crime

41:52.552 --> 41:54.471
would get me
to you quicker, so...

41:54.512 --> 41:57.349
There's a new young gun in town
and I'm ready to rock the show.

41:57.390 --> 42:00.185
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

42:00.227 --> 42:02.437
here comes Shockwave.

42:02.479 --> 42:05.315
-(cheering and applause)

42:15.825 --> 42:17.786
You all right?

42:17.827 --> 42:20.330
Huh? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm good. I'm good.

42:20.372 --> 42:22.707
I'm fast, baby.
Like, how I roll, you know?

42:22.749 --> 42:24.709
You look wired as hell.

42:24.751 --> 42:27.045
Well, it's just Mom's, uh...
Her spirit

42:27.087 --> 42:29.047
is flowing through my body,
you know what I'm saying?

42:29.089 --> 42:31.341
-(grunts)
-BUTCHER:
I've got eyes on A-Train.

42:31.383 --> 42:32.676
He's totally jacked.

42:32.717 --> 42:34.219
He must've shot up the V.

42:34.261 --> 42:36.763
(sighs) We missed it, boys.

42:55.156 --> 42:58.076
I'm out of here.
I'll check in later.

42:58.118 --> 43:01.246
BUTCHER:
Where the hell you going?

43:01.288 --> 43:02.706
Just gonna see about a girl.

43:02.747 --> 43:04.040
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

43:04.082 --> 43:07.544
please turn your attention
to the track.

43:39.367 --> 43:42.912
Please, clear the track.

43:45.749 --> 43:47.625
Set.

43:54.632 --> 43:56.593
(cheering and applause)

44:02.432 --> 44:03.683
WOMAN:
Yes!

44:03.725 --> 44:05.435
ANNOUNCER:
He's done it again!

44:05.477 --> 44:08.021
A-Train wins!

44:08.063 --> 44:09.564
A new world record for A-Train.

44:09.606 --> 44:11.983
They say lightning
doesn't strike twice.

44:12.025 --> 44:14.027
(cheering)

44:14.069 --> 44:16.029
The world belongs to A-Train.

44:16.071 --> 44:19.574
A-Train wins.

44:19.616 --> 44:20.992
A-Train wins!

44:21.034 --> 44:24.496
Stunning!
Absolutely stunning.

44:24.537 --> 44:27.165
(horn honks)

44:30.210 --> 44:32.212
So, how the hell
do you know Starlight?

44:32.253 --> 44:34.381
I don't really know her
know her.

44:34.422 --> 44:36.508
Just, uh...

44:36.549 --> 44:39.052
we met on a park bench.

44:39.094 --> 44:41.554
Huh. You get her number?

44:45.266 --> 44:47.477
Yeah.

44:48.478 --> 44:49.437
Hughie?

44:49.479 --> 44:52.690
Uh, yeah. Got it.

44:52.732 --> 44:53.942
Good.

44:56.694 --> 44:59.030
(phone rings)

44:59.072 --> 45:01.032
M.M.

45:01.074 --> 45:04.202
Popclaw's eyeballing a vial of V
like it's made of Snickers.

45:04.244 --> 45:05.995
What, you think she nicked
some of A-Train's stash?

45:06.037 --> 45:07.747
MOTHER'S MILK:
That's exactly what I'm saying.

45:07.789 --> 45:09.207
Get over here now.

45:09.249 --> 45:13.002
A-TRAIN (on TV): Well,
you know what? Shockwave ran

45:13.044 --> 45:14.921
a good, clean race,
but, uh, there can only be

45:14.963 --> 45:16.923
one fastest man in the world,

45:16.965 --> 45:18.716
and that's the A-Train, baby!
(chuckles)

45:18.758 --> 45:20.593
-Yes, baby.
-REPORTER: A-Train,

45:20.635 --> 45:23.471
how are you celebrating tonight?
Any special girl?

45:23.513 --> 45:25.515
Uh... well, you know me.

45:26.558 --> 45:28.226
I'm always in the game,

45:28.268 --> 45:30.562
but I'm too fast to catch.

45:30.603 --> 45:33.690
I'm open to offers,
though, ladies.

45:33.731 --> 45:35.275
There's plenty to go around.

45:35.316 --> 45:36.484
REPORTER:
A-Train, how have you managed

45:36.526 --> 45:38.027
to stay on top all this time?

45:38.069 --> 45:40.029
What's your secret?

45:40.071 --> 45:43.032
A-TRAIN:
Secret? There's no secret.

45:43.074 --> 45:45.785
It's just about discipline
and training

45:45.827 --> 45:48.163
and keeping your head
in the game, staying focused.

45:48.204 --> 45:50.206
(heartbeat thumping)

45:53.585 --> 45:56.087
(gasps)

45:56.129 --> 45:57.714

Farris and Jonas Sorman playing)

45:57.755 --> 46:00.383

46:05.430 --> 46:07.307
Fucking hell.

46:07.348 --> 46:09.559
-(Popclaw grunting)
-You said it.

46:09.601 --> 46:11.186
She's been at it for an hour.

46:11.227 --> 46:13.104
POPCLAW:
Come and get me!

46:13.146 --> 46:15.690
How'd you know
to keep an eye on her?

46:15.732 --> 46:17.609
Okay.

46:17.650 --> 46:18.943
You see that red case
over there?

46:18.985 --> 46:20.653
I've been around long enough
to know

46:20.695 --> 46:22.363
a fix kit when I see one.

46:22.405 --> 46:25.825
And she told A-Train
that V's a slippery slope.

46:25.867 --> 46:27.535
So she's got experience.

46:27.577 --> 46:29.078
I figured if you wait around
long enough,

46:29.120 --> 46:30.830
two plus two equals nasty.

46:30.872 --> 46:32.749
Sherlock fucking Homie.

46:32.790 --> 46:34.542
Now admit it.

46:34.584 --> 46:37.962
This beats babysitting
delinquents any day, don't it?

46:38.004 --> 46:41.007

-house call?
-I'm just here for the rent.

47:08.743 --> 47:10.703
The rent you said you would pay?

47:10.745 --> 47:12.580
You should come in.

47:12.622 --> 47:15.041
You can wait there if you want,

47:15.083 --> 47:17.210
but it's gonna take me a few
minutes to write the check.

47:17.252 --> 47:19.212
I don't bite.

-Alek, right?

47:24.551 --> 47:26.219
Okay, let's get that check.

47:26.261 --> 47:29.180
You want a drink, Alek,

47:36.104 --> 47:37.814

-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

Huh? No.

Yes.

47:51.369 --> 47:54.122
I mean, it's... lovely.

47:54.163 --> 47:55.582
It's okay.

-Hmm.

48:13.600 --> 48:15.602
...there is a world

48:15.643 --> 48:17.645

48:35.913 --> 48:38.583
I am gonna sit right here

-until the cops come.
-(groans)

48:41.169 --> 48:43.046
You're not a cat burglar.

48:43.087 --> 48:46.049
You're a filthy pig. Say it.

48:46.090 --> 48:50.386
You're a filthy pig
who likes to eat ass.

48:50.428 --> 48:51.888
Say it!

48:51.929 --> 48:53.139

I'm a filthy pig

49:46.526 --> 49:50.029
You let that guy die.

49:50.071 --> 49:51.781
And he didn't do anything wrong.

49:51.823 --> 49:52.907
He was dead already.

49:52.949 --> 49:54.242
That's bullshit.

49:54.283 --> 49:56.035
So you can cross a street,

49:56.077 --> 49:58.246
run up four flights of stairs
in ten seconds

49:58.287 --> 50:00.289
like some Supe, can you?

50:01.332 --> 50:03.000
And even if
you had've got there,

50:03.042 --> 50:05.420
she would have clawed
your fucking head off.

50:05.461 --> 50:09.048
Now we got her
right where we want her.

50:09.090 --> 50:10.967
What? What?
What are you talking about?

50:11.008 --> 50:13.010
You're a smart lad,
but you still ain't twigged

50:13.052 --> 50:16.097

Come on, Frenchie.

50:28.025 --> 50:31.070
(door closes)

50:31.112 --> 50:33.072
Like you said.

50:33.114 --> 50:36.075
Whatever the price,
you'll pay it.

50:36.117 --> 50:38.119
Right?

50:44.083 --> 50:45.835
(Popclaw gasps)

50:45.877 --> 50:47.628
Easy. Easy.

50:47.670 --> 50:50.339
We ain't here to hurt you.

50:54.260 --> 50:56.095
We're gonna help you
sort out this little mess.

51:01.642 --> 51:03.644
And all you got to do

51:03.686 --> 51:07.774
is tell us everything you know
about this.

51:08.816 --> 51:11.027
Who are you?

51:13.529 --> 51:17.325
All right, I got your message.
Where is the fire?

51:17.366 --> 51:20.953
No, no, not fire. Water.

51:20.995 --> 51:23.498
Just ask my little guppy here.

51:25.041 --> 51:27.043
You can show her.

51:30.087 --> 51:33.216
Well, a very good friend of mine

51:33.257 --> 51:34.717
-found this.
-It was a porpoise.

51:34.759 --> 51:37.303
A fucking porpoise found this
at the bottom

51:37.345 --> 51:38.679
of the harbor.

51:41.933 --> 51:43.726
Go ahead, don't be shy.

51:50.483 --> 51:51.651
(gasps)

51:51.692 --> 51:53.736
Oh! Jesus Christ.

51:53.778 --> 51:55.112
Is that Translucent?

51:55.154 --> 51:57.323
Still think we got nothing
to worry about?

51:57.365 --> 51:59.659
How did they even get through
his skin?

51:59.700 --> 52:01.661
What kind of maniac...

52:01.702 --> 52:04.497
Mm-mm. Not maniac.

52:04.539 --> 52:07.542
Smart, actually.

52:07.583 --> 52:10.670
Very smart.

52:10.711 --> 52:15.007
Hey, Deep,
what can't I see through?

52:15.049 --> 52:17.552
-Zinc, Homelander.
-Correct.

52:17.593 --> 52:19.595
And what's the box made of,
Deep?

52:22.765 --> 52:25.768
-Zinc.
-Correct again.

52:25.810 --> 52:28.521
(chuckles): They also knew
that we'd find Translucent--

52:28.563 --> 52:31.357
what's left of him--
eventually.

52:31.399 --> 52:33.568
So they were just buying time.

52:33.609 --> 52:35.403
Why do you say that?

52:35.444 --> 52:37.572
I'm so glad you asked.

52:49.292 --> 52:52.128
Whoever it was...

52:52.169 --> 52:54.589
they just declared war.
