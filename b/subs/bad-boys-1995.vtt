Listen, yes, okay,

01:13:20.438 --> 01:13:22.439
This whole thing started
because of missing drugs.

01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:23.815
But let me tell you something:

There's nothing, absolutely nothing,
more important to Mike...

expressing his real feelings.

MIKE:
This has not been a good day.

01:13:52.762 --> 01:13:54.429
Damn right. This is bullshit.

01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:57.682

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:39.808
What's he talking about?

...that blew up on the ice-cream truck?

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:45.480
They were gonna use
that to process the heroin.

01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:48.358
Yeah, they do that to cut it.
It, like, quadruples the value.

01:14:48.568 --> 01:14:50.694
MARCUS: Yeah, you can't
just stick it in the microwave.

01:14:50.862 --> 01:14:53.405
Maybe you're on to something.
Let's just pay for this, all right?

01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:59.911
MIKE: Hey, how much is that?
- $14.25.

01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:02.414

You have got to shut up
and let him drive, okay?
