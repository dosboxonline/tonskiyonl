00:16.016 --> 00:18.436
(wind chime tinkling)

00:27.069 --> 00:29.113
(panting)

00:49.175 --> 00:50.634
(moans)

00:50.676 --> 00:53.387
(panting)

00:53.429 --> 00:54.889
(bulldog panting)

00:54.930 --> 00:56.807
-Come on.
-Mm-mm.

00:56.849 --> 00:58.642
-Just come with.
-Nuh-uh.

00:58.684 --> 01:01.771
-Please? (laughs)
-No fucking way.

01:01.812 --> 01:04.815
This may be
their last reunion tour ever.

01:04.857 --> 01:07.067
-Yeah, I fucking hope so.
-(laughs)

01:07.109 --> 01:08.360
They're the best band.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.154
Oh, come off it.

01:10.196 --> 01:12.573
Look, I ain't stopping you.
If you really want to go,

01:12.615 --> 01:14.742
I'll buy you front row seats.
You can take Rachel.

01:14.784 --> 01:16.577
I don't want to take Rachel.

01:16.619 --> 01:19.079
-I want you to come with me.
-(groans)

01:19.121 --> 01:21.248
I would be forced to chop
my fucking ears off.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.000
-I'll make a mess everywhere.
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:23.042 --> 01:24.627
Then I would just have
to clean it up.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.295
-You would?
-Yeah.

01:26.337 --> 01:28.297
Smart-ass.
(chuckles)

01:28.339 --> 01:29.965
You love it.

01:30.007 --> 01:31.967
-Do I?
-Yeah, you do.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.469
Yeah.

01:38.182 --> 01:39.767
(Becca chuckles softly)

01:39.809 --> 01:41.602
(kiss)

01:41.644 --> 01:43.229

(beeps)

03:24.038 --> 03:25.706
-(gasps)
-Morning, Deputy Director.

03:28.959 --> 03:32.087
How did you get in here?

03:32.129 --> 03:34.131
You're like the fucking mold

03:34.173 --> 03:35.674
on my laundry room tiles.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.677
You scrape it off,
comes right back.

03:38.719 --> 03:42.973
Sounds like you got a little bit
of a moisture problem, luv.

03:43.015 --> 03:45.142
Security, please.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.603
I can stop 'em getting Supes
in the military.

03:47.645 --> 03:49.605
What makes you think I care?

03:49.647 --> 03:52.733
Personally, I can't wait
until they're in Syria.

03:52.775 --> 03:55.027
Yeah, I'll bet.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.613
Last week.

03:57.655 --> 03:59.823
A-Train, mainlining

03:59.865 --> 04:01.450
before the big race.
His fuck buddy,

04:01.492 --> 04:02.868
Popclaw,

04:02.910 --> 04:05.412
pinning the same stuff.

04:05.454 --> 04:07.206
They call it Compound V.
It's some kind of

04:07.247 --> 04:08.958
booster or steroid for Supes.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.167
Jacks 'em right up.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.252
Now, word gets out that Supes

04:12.294 --> 04:14.004
are nothing but a bunch
of juice junkies,

04:14.046 --> 04:16.674
no one's gonna want 'em
in national defense.

04:16.715 --> 04:17.925
Mm-hmm.

04:17.967 --> 04:19.969
Got a sample?

04:20.010 --> 04:21.762
Not yet.

04:21.804 --> 04:22.763
Mm.

04:22.805 --> 04:24.264
This could be heroin.

04:24.306 --> 04:25.975
It could be anything.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.309
You don't trust me.

04:27.351 --> 04:29.353
Susan, I am shocked and saddened
by that.

04:29.395 --> 04:30.354
Really?

04:30.396 --> 04:31.522
I'm sure.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.148
Speaking of which,

04:33.190 --> 04:35.651
I haven't seen Translucent
around anywhere.

04:35.693 --> 04:39.238
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

04:39.279 --> 04:40.656
Cunt's invisible.

04:40.698 --> 04:42.491
He could be standing
in that fucking corner,

04:42.533 --> 04:44.743
plugging one out right now,
for all we know.

04:44.785 --> 04:49.039
Look, you think Supes
are cunts now?

04:49.081 --> 04:51.250
You just wait till
they're wearing camo.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.002
I mean, what's to stop
Sergeant Homelander

04:53.043 --> 04:55.254
from killing a couple
of hundred thousand Chinese?

04:55.295 --> 04:57.423
How are you gonna try him
for war crimes?

04:57.464 --> 04:58.841
He's gonna murder
the bloody lot of us

04:58.882 --> 05:00.676
before he steps one foot
in The Hague.

05:00.718 --> 05:02.970
I mean, you might as well
hand the bloody launch keys

05:03.012 --> 05:04.430
over to Vought right now.

05:09.184 --> 05:11.395
You're really working
this one, huh?

05:11.437 --> 05:14.565
Just being
an upstanding citizen, luv.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.775
Oh, I know.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.778
Okay.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.072
You get me some hard proof,

05:22.114 --> 05:25.200
something actionable
that I can use,

05:25.242 --> 05:29.163
and maybe I'll throw you
a few bucks.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.290
For your operating costs.

05:35.961 --> 05:38.172
But if you fuck me on this,

05:38.213 --> 05:41.050
for the rest of your life,
you'll be drinking your own piss

05:41.091 --> 05:43.886
at a black site.

05:43.927 --> 05:46.305
Say you understand.

05:46.346 --> 05:51.268
See, now, Susan, this is why
it never went anywhere with us.

05:51.310 --> 05:53.937
You can't have two alpha males,
'cause inevitably someone's...

05:53.979 --> 05:58.150
Say you fucking understand.

05:58.192 --> 06:02.237
I understand.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.531
Remind me, what was our deal?

06:04.573 --> 06:07.493
-POPCLAW (over phone): What?
-What was our fucking deal?

06:07.534 --> 06:11.163
Go to hell. I already told you,
A-Train runs the Compound...

06:11.205 --> 06:13.749
Yeah, runs the Compound V to
the noodle shop up on Division.

06:13.791 --> 06:16.543
We've been up on it all week
and we ain't seen fuck all.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.712
Well, wherever he's going,
it's around there,

06:18.754 --> 06:20.589
because every time
he leaves with the V,

06:20.631 --> 06:22.841
he comes back with the sesame
noodles. That's all I know.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.593
Well, you'd better
be right, love,

06:24.635 --> 06:27.137
or you and your dearly
departed landlord

06:27.179 --> 06:28.931
are gonna find yourselves
on Pornhub

06:28.972 --> 06:30.808
in the Fatal Cunnilingus
section.

06:30.849 --> 06:33.102
You son of a bitch,
if you even...

06:33.143 --> 06:36.814
(panting)

06:36.855 --> 06:39.274
MOTHER'S MILK:
Sorry, baby, just, work's

06:39.316 --> 06:41.151
just been a motherfucker lately.

06:41.193 --> 06:43.112
You know I'd much rather be
at home, rubbing on them toes

06:43.153 --> 06:44.571
than out here breaking up
yard fights,

06:44.613 --> 06:46.949
but you know, a brother
got to get paid, right?

06:46.990 --> 06:48.492
Oh, most definitely.

06:48.534 --> 06:50.953
Payday comes, we gonna be
all up in Kay Jewelers,

06:50.994 --> 06:52.746
tearing it down.

06:52.788 --> 06:54.331
Champagne showers.

06:54.373 --> 06:56.583
(laughs)

06:56.625 --> 06:59.044
I know, I know,
I'm just kidding.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.213
All right, sweetheart.
Talk to you.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.965
(kissing sounds)

07:05.259 --> 07:07.553
Say something.

07:10.222 --> 07:12.182
Well, you know,
Jean-Paul Sartre said

07:12.224 --> 07:16.270
marriage stifles
our essential male urges.

07:16.311 --> 07:19.273
Jean-Paul Sartre also died
a old, lonely motherfucker.

07:19.314 --> 07:20.983
Not to mention his girl

07:21.024 --> 07:22.568
was shacking up
with some other dude.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.653
Uh, oui.
They were free to explore.

07:24.695 --> 07:26.947
Explore what? Gonorrhea?

07:26.989 --> 07:28.949
Come on, Frenchie.

07:28.991 --> 07:31.326
Why work so motherfucking hard
if you don't have somebody

07:31.368 --> 07:33.370
to go home to and sleep
next to at night?

07:33.412 --> 07:36.206
Well, I go to sleep next to
someone different every night.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.083
Yeah, and that's 'cause you're
an old, lonely fucker, too.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.127
-And you're gonna die
by yourself.
-Mm.

07:40.169 --> 07:42.129
Well, if you and Monique
have something so pure,

07:42.171 --> 07:45.174
why are you lying to her
about where you are?

07:55.100 --> 07:57.603
Noodle Guy. He's packing.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.063
About time we see something.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.814
We got to go in there, don't we?

08:42.856 --> 08:44.733
Don't be scared, petit Hughie.

08:44.775 --> 08:48.028
Will you stop calling me that?
I'm, like, six feet tall.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.744
(indistinct chatter in distance)

09:01.917 --> 09:03.335
(guards speaking Filipino)

09:19.142 --> 09:21.144
(mouths)

09:26.942 --> 09:28.944
(song in Japanese playing
faintly)

09:39.454 --> 09:42.582
(song gets louder)

09:42.624 --> 09:44.501
MOTHER'S MILK (whispering):
Let's hurry up, let's go.

09:44.543 --> 09:46.920
Check those boxes.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.636
Frenchie, look for the V.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.437
Frenchie, come on, let's go,

10:03.478 --> 10:05.480
Check these boxes.

10:08.191 --> 10:12.362
Come on, Frenchie,
what are you doing?

10:12.404 --> 10:14.489
Are you deaf?

10:16.533 --> 10:18.535
Jesus.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.460
Who's that?

10:26.501 --> 10:28.462
I think we should let her go.

10:28.503 --> 10:31.548
No, no, no, no, no, uh-uh. We're
here for the V, and we get out.

10:31.590 --> 10:33.258
This isn't a rescue.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.302
You sound like Butcher.

10:35.344 --> 10:37.637
I sound like a motherfucker
that wants to be breathing.

10:40.515 --> 10:43.060
Goddamn it, Frenchie,
what the...

10:44.895 --> 10:46.396
Hey! Don't set her free!

10:51.943 --> 10:53.445
(screaming)

10:53.487 --> 10:55.280
Oh, my God!

11:08.293 --> 11:09.795
Oh, fuck.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.838
Hughie, let's go!
Let's go, Hughie!

11:11.880 --> 11:13.006
Come on!

11:14.883 --> 11:17.844
(grunting, shouting)

11:19.012 --> 11:21.014
(panting softly)

11:28.563 --> 11:30.649
-(groans)
-(panting)

11:33.944 --> 11:36.780
(birds singing)

11:36.822 --> 11:40.033
DEEP: Couple weeks ago,
we were all getting...

11:40.075 --> 11:42.077
we were all getting wasted
in the common room.

11:42.119 --> 11:44.496
It was, like,
Super Bowl, I think.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.748
(sighs)

11:46.790 --> 11:49.292
And I don't know.
Maybe I was just drunk, but...

11:49.334 --> 11:51.920
(clock ticking)

11:51.962 --> 11:53.964
...you know, I tried.

11:55.340 --> 11:58.677
I-I really tried...

11:58.718 --> 12:00.804
to talk to the guys.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.806
About...?

12:02.848 --> 12:05.600
Dolphins.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.727
Did you know, in Japan,
that they

12:07.769 --> 12:10.272
hunt down and slaughter
20,000 dolphins a year?

12:10.313 --> 12:12.274
Intelligent animals.

12:12.315 --> 12:15.610
Yeah,
that have regional accents, and

12:15.652 --> 12:17.863
a great sense of humor.
I mean, they're...

12:17.904 --> 12:19.865
(chuckling)
They're hilarious.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.868
(chuckles)
Yeah.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.787
And that night, A-Train

12:25.829 --> 12:31.251
thought it'd be funny to stick
a blow-up dolphin in my bed.

12:31.293 --> 12:33.753
With lipstick on its blowhole.

12:33.795 --> 12:36.047
Yeah, real creative pricks.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.841
(exhales)

12:39.551 --> 12:41.511
I'm sorry.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.680
That must have hurt.

12:45.932 --> 12:49.186
Yeah, I'm-I'm...
I'm the diversity hire.

12:49.227 --> 12:51.563
I'm a joke.

12:53.565 --> 12:57.527
I mean, yeah,
I can talk to fish. So what?

12:57.569 --> 13:01.865
How often do you need to be
saved by a school of salmon?

13:01.907 --> 13:04.993
Kevin, that's just not true.

13:05.035 --> 13:08.705
Where would that Carnival
cruise ship be without you?

13:08.747 --> 13:12.667
Yeah. I know.

13:14.711 --> 13:19.174
Okay, I need to...
self-actualize,

13:19.216 --> 13:20.425
show more confidence.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.720
After all, who are you?

13:23.762 --> 13:25.889
I'm one of The Seven.

13:25.931 --> 13:27.516
And what does that mean?

13:27.557 --> 13:29.184
I can do anything
I set my mind to.

13:29.226 --> 13:32.062
What do you want
to set your mind to?

13:32.103 --> 13:35.190
(exhales)

13:35.232 --> 13:37.234
(Japanese song playing on TV)

13:59.673 --> 14:01.716
BUTCHER:
What a mess.

14:01.758 --> 14:05.053
You all right?

14:05.095 --> 14:06.346
I mean, just when you think

14:06.388 --> 14:07.764
this shit can't get
any more horrible...

14:07.806 --> 14:09.182
Nah, don't worry.

14:09.224 --> 14:12.394
It can get a lot more horrible.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.832
Butcher, come check this out.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.463
Take a look.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.301
V.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.346
So, A-Train's running it here,

14:48.388 --> 14:50.724
and these blokes are dosing
the Asian bird with it.

14:50.765 --> 14:52.017
Yeah, back when
they had eyeballs.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.311
Yeah, but why?

14:54.352 --> 14:56.938
Is it a Vought thing or,
like, a side hustle?

14:56.980 --> 14:58.690
Came gift-wrapped in this.

15:02.027 --> 15:04.154
Find out where it came from.

15:04.195 --> 15:06.281
I'll shake a few trees.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.284
Why the hell were they
dosing her?

15:09.326 --> 15:11.494
Why don't we ask
foie gras over here?

15:11.536 --> 15:13.496
He's the one that let her out.

15:13.538 --> 15:15.582
-She looked innocent.
-Innocent?

15:15.624 --> 15:19.127
(chuckles) She's locked up
in a cage, underground,

15:19.169 --> 15:20.629
with two armed guards?

15:20.670 --> 15:22.297
I had a feeling about her.

15:22.339 --> 15:24.591
Nah, Frenchie,
you just didn't follow the plan.

15:24.633 --> 15:26.009
You never follow the plan, man.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.802
You need to unclench
your asshole.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.304
You need to eat
my clenched asshole,

15:29.346 --> 15:31.014
-how 'bout that?
-Why are you two carrying on

15:31.056 --> 15:33.141
-like a bunch of fucking twats?
-(phone chimes)

15:33.183 --> 15:34.517
We're sniffing down
a shit sandwich

15:34.559 --> 15:35.935
the size of Watergate.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.897
Vought and the Supes are both
gonna be looking for her.

15:38.938 --> 15:42.067
All we got to do is
find the female first.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.943
(phone chimes)

15:47.614 --> 15:49.491
Keep looking.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.912
Who's that, then, eh?

15:53.953 --> 15:55.830
It's nobody.

16:01.711 --> 16:04.047
"Annie?" Starlight?

16:04.089 --> 16:06.091
HUGHIE: Yeah, it's nothing.
I mean, we were supposed to

16:06.132 --> 16:07.342
go on a date.

16:07.384 --> 16:09.552
Not a date, just, she asked me

16:09.594 --> 16:11.554
if I wanted to ask her
for her number,

16:11.596 --> 16:12.806
and then we just
kind of platonically

16:12.847 --> 16:14.099
exchanged information,
but the--

16:14.140 --> 16:16.518
the word "date" was
never mentioned.

16:16.559 --> 16:18.561
Call her back right now.
You're fucking going.

16:18.603 --> 16:23.066
As a rule, I don't usually
go out after a gory massacre.

16:23.108 --> 16:24.901
Listen, here's the job.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.361
You're gonna hot mic her phone.

16:26.403 --> 16:28.697
From now on, we hear
everything she says.

16:28.738 --> 16:31.074
I mean,
this is a golden opportunity.

16:31.116 --> 16:34.452
And after all you done,
piece of cake.

16:34.494 --> 16:38.498
Yeah, she's not a--
She's not a bad person.

16:40.375 --> 16:43.169
She's a Supe, Hughie.

16:43.211 --> 16:45.755
Just like the fucking rest
of them.

16:50.301 --> 16:52.595
STILLWELL:
Okay, we are not gonna be able
to cover this up forever.

16:52.637 --> 16:55.014
Translucent does not
show his face soon,

16:55.056 --> 16:56.433
people are gonna start
to notice.

16:56.474 --> 16:57.684
What if we just
get in front of it?

16:57.726 --> 16:59.644
Tell the world
he died tragically

16:59.686 --> 17:01.146
in the service of his country.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.648
We could have an amazing
funeral, bigger than Kennedy's.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.942
I don't know, admit that
one of our unkillable

17:05.984 --> 17:07.610
superheroes just got killed?

17:07.652 --> 17:09.362
Kiss that military bill
good-bye.

17:09.404 --> 17:10.905
Let's not overthink it.

17:10.947 --> 17:12.824
We just say he's on
a classified mission.

17:12.866 --> 17:16.703
We can't say where, in the
interest of national security.

17:16.745 --> 17:18.121
All we can say is
he's fighting MS-13.

17:18.163 --> 17:19.414
Ooh, yes. That's good.

17:19.456 --> 17:20.957
Simple. Done. Boom.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.084
-MS-13. I like it.
-(phone ringing)

17:23.126 --> 17:25.503
STILLWELL:
Hello?

17:27.255 --> 17:30.675
What? When?

17:31.885 --> 17:35.305
How many people know?

17:35.346 --> 17:36.973
STILLWELL:
Seven minutes ago,

17:37.015 --> 17:39.350
Trans-Oceanic Flight 37
from Paris to Chicago

17:39.392 --> 17:41.561
was hijacked mid-air.

17:41.603 --> 17:42.979
-Seven minutes ago?
-Yeah.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.647
A source from NORAD
gave us a heads up.

17:44.689 --> 17:45.899
MAEVE:
How many hijackers?

17:45.940 --> 17:46.983
STILLWELL:
Well, looks like three.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.777
MAEVE:
Did they scramble F-16's?

17:48.818 --> 17:50.487
Yep, as we speak.

17:50.528 --> 17:53.239
But you can get there quicker.

17:53.281 --> 17:54.699
(Maeve sighs)

17:54.741 --> 17:55.992
STILLWELL:
Can I please have the room?

17:58.870 --> 18:00.079
HOMELANDER:
Oh, middle of the Atlantic.

18:00.121 --> 18:02.499
-Yep.
-No-man's-land.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.459
STILLWELL: You can't operate
on foreign soil,

18:04.501 --> 18:06.711
but a plane hijacked
over international waters--

18:06.753 --> 18:09.506
If you intercept,
no one will protest.

18:09.547 --> 18:13.009
If you bring those passengers
back alive,

18:13.051 --> 18:15.261
not one congressman
will have the balls

18:15.303 --> 18:17.222
to vote against our bill.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.182
Mm-hmm.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.897
This is our chance.

18:25.939 --> 18:29.192
More important than Translucent.

18:29.234 --> 18:32.070
More important than anything.

18:34.989 --> 18:37.200
Concentrated halothane.

18:39.244 --> 18:41.704
-(clatter)
-It's not a guarantee,

18:41.746 --> 18:44.040
but it should knock out
your girl.

18:44.082 --> 18:45.959
(smooches)
Merci, pumpkin.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.961
I must go; this girl,
she's got a head start.

18:48.002 --> 18:51.714
Hey, I miss you.

18:51.756 --> 18:54.092
I got us a pied-á-terre
on the Bowery.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.470
When will you be coming by?

18:57.512 --> 19:01.516
As soon as I can.

19:01.558 --> 19:02.517
Promise.

19:02.559 --> 19:03.518
-Promise?
-Mm-hmm.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.520
(pained groan)

19:06.813 --> 19:09.274
Don't make me use
that gas on you,

19:09.315 --> 19:11.150
huh, pumpkin?

19:11.192 --> 19:12.777
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.029
-Okay.
-Mm. Oh...

19:15.071 --> 19:17.073
CHERIE:
Mm.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.827
-(door bells jingle)
-(Cherie sighs)

19:25.415 --> 19:27.417
(indistinct radio chatter)

19:41.764 --> 19:43.349
Fuck!

19:45.685 --> 19:49.105
When will they intercept?

19:49.147 --> 19:51.149
Corporal, I don't care
who is in the room with you,

19:51.190 --> 19:53.902
-I need a goddamn update.
-(knock at door)

19:53.943 --> 19:55.820
Jesus.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.822
Hey. Do you have a second?

19:57.864 --> 19:59.532
It is not really a good time.

19:59.574 --> 20:01.826
I'd really appreciate it.
Super quick.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.412
-Pretty please? Thank you.
-No... Oh, okay.

20:04.454 --> 20:08.374
(sighs)
So... I found a mission.

20:08.416 --> 20:09.584
Uh-huh.

20:09.626 --> 20:13.421
And I think
it's really important.

20:13.463 --> 20:16.049
And I'd like to do it,
with your permission, of course.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.384
What? Where?

20:18.426 --> 20:21.471
-Oceanland.
-Oceanland?

20:21.512 --> 20:26.100
Yeah. So, get this,
the dolphins there,

20:26.142 --> 20:30.480
I mean, they are really underfed
and abused.

20:30.521 --> 20:34.317
To be quite honest,
they're really frustrated.

20:34.359 --> 20:37.153
And I'd like to, you know,
just shine a light on it.

20:37.195 --> 20:39.489
I think people would
really respond to that.

20:39.530 --> 20:43.242
You do realize that you are
at the centerpiece

20:43.284 --> 20:45.536
of the Oceanland fall campaign?

20:45.578 --> 20:47.747
Yeah, well, I mean, we could
just bail on that, right?

20:47.789 --> 20:49.248
The deal sucks anyways.

20:49.290 --> 20:50.792
No, we can't.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.377
Listen, I'd just like to,
you know,

20:52.418 --> 20:55.338
maybe do something
with a little more substance.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.298
Okay.

20:57.340 --> 20:58.466
-Yeah?
-I hear you. Yes.

20:58.508 --> 20:59.550
-Okay?
-Uh-huh.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.637
Deep...

21:02.679 --> 21:03.930
play to your strengths.

21:19.153 --> 21:21.698
Hey. baby.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.616
Hey...

21:29.247 --> 21:30.873
What'd you do?

21:30.915 --> 21:33.626
What the hell are you
talking about?

21:33.668 --> 21:36.045
Who did you tell about
Compound V?

21:37.088 --> 21:39.799
Nobody. Why? What...

21:39.841 --> 21:42.802
Because you're the only
person who knew, other than me,

21:42.844 --> 21:46.264
that I had it...
where I was taking it.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.934
I-I didn't tell anyone anything.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.269
You're being paranoid.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.312
Who else did you fucking tell?!

21:59.068 --> 22:00.528
Don't yell at me.

22:00.570 --> 22:04.032
Listen to me.

22:04.073 --> 22:05.074
Sit down.

22:17.211 --> 22:19.839
Look, I love you.
You know I do.

22:19.881 --> 22:22.383
I've loved you since
the first time that we met.

22:22.425 --> 22:25.553
Oh, really?
I heard you at the race.

22:25.595 --> 22:28.514
No girlfriend.
Open to offers.

22:28.556 --> 22:30.433
Come on, I have to say
those things.

22:30.475 --> 22:33.728
You know this.
They make me.

22:33.770 --> 22:36.272
It's my brand.

22:39.317 --> 22:40.651
Come here.

22:42.195 --> 22:44.155
(quietly):
Come here.

22:48.659 --> 22:51.245
You remember when you relapsed?

22:51.287 --> 22:52.663
Yes.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.041
And I stayed and I rubbed
your back.

22:55.083 --> 22:57.376
Cleaned up your puke.

22:59.921 --> 23:02.340
I'm there for you, always.

23:06.594 --> 23:09.013
I know, baby.

23:10.473 --> 23:13.726
Please,

23:13.768 --> 23:16.521
tell me who you told.

23:16.562 --> 23:19.190
'Cause we're in trouble.
We're in a lot of trouble.

23:26.072 --> 23:29.784
I didn't tell anyone.

23:45.216 --> 23:47.176
Either way, you're gonna
have to pack a bag,

23:47.218 --> 23:49.720
so get everything that you need.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.848
Why? Where are we going?

23:51.889 --> 23:53.891
I'm gonna take care of this,

23:53.933 --> 23:55.893
but until I do,
I got to get you somewhere safe,

23:55.935 --> 23:57.937
before Homelander finds out.

23:59.397 --> 24:02.233
I love you.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.198
I love you, too.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.873
("Eyes Can't Hide"
by Extreme Music plays)

24:35.725 --> 24:39.020
Mani? Pedi? Special deal.

24:40.521 --> 24:42.940
(woman screaming)

24:45.151 --> 24:47.820
The hilarious
Dolphins Ahoy Extravaganza,

24:47.862 --> 24:50.448
starring these two knuckleheads.

24:50.489 --> 24:54.535
So this fall, remember, go Deep.
Go Oceanland.

24:54.577 --> 24:57.121
All right, let's see
what you got.

25:10.927 --> 25:13.846
You said you, uh,
you bowled before?

25:13.888 --> 25:16.474
Yeah, I'm just a little rusty.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.810
-You?
-Uh, yeah. Here, actually.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.479
My whole life.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.147
I had my first kiss
with Amy Seeler

25:23.189 --> 25:24.857
in the men's bathroom
when I was 14.

25:24.899 --> 25:27.860
-It was really romantic.
-Yeah.

25:27.902 --> 25:30.905
I'm sure that's exactly how
she pictured her first kiss.

25:30.947 --> 25:32.823
Excuse me.
Where was your first kiss?

25:32.865 --> 25:33.824
Prom.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.577
It was amazing.

25:36.619 --> 25:39.747
Wait, senior prom?

25:39.789 --> 25:41.749
So your first kiss
was when you were 18?

25:41.791 --> 25:43.584
Mm-hmm.

25:43.626 --> 25:45.211
Which you're not joking about,

25:45.253 --> 25:47.213
and that's fine, that's great.

25:47.255 --> 25:50.258
Yeah, I had a very
Jesus-centric childhood.

25:50.299 --> 25:51.550
(pins crashing)

25:52.760 --> 25:54.553
(high-pitched ringing)

25:54.595 --> 25:57.265
-Yeah!
-(whoops)

25:57.306 --> 26:00.434
(muffled voices)

26:00.476 --> 26:02.103
STARLIGHT:
He never asked me out again.

26:02.144 --> 26:04.897
Sorry. Um, what were you saying?

26:04.939 --> 26:07.817
No, just about prom.

26:07.858 --> 26:10.236
-What was it-- what about...
-Nothing.

26:10.278 --> 26:11.570
It's-it's stupid.

26:11.612 --> 26:16.200
Um, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna throw one.

26:17.326 --> 26:21.580
Ah! Ah.

26:21.622 --> 26:23.958
So what's, uh,
what's Translucent like?

26:24.000 --> 26:27.378
That's a conversational
left turn.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.130
Yes, it was.
I'm sorry about that.

26:29.171 --> 26:30.798
Sorry. Yeah, it just
popped into my head.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.550
As a kid, he was my favorite.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.303
You said the other ones
were dicks; is he a dick, too?

26:35.344 --> 26:40.224
Well, I mean, he's not great
with privacy or boundaries,

26:40.266 --> 26:42.268
I will say that.

26:42.310 --> 26:45.062
But otherwise,
he seems like a loner.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.523
He spends most of his free time
with his son.

26:50.067 --> 26:53.988
-He's got a son?
-Yeah. Early divorce, I think.

26:54.030 --> 26:55.906
He's about ten.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.868
Hunter or Maverick
or something like that.

27:14.216 --> 27:16.969
(speaking Arabic)

27:17.011 --> 27:20.014
(passengers whimpering, crying)

27:20.056 --> 27:22.433
(woman screams)

27:25.436 --> 27:27.146
-(gasps)
-(speaking Arabic)

27:27.188 --> 27:28.481
It's okay.

27:28.522 --> 27:31.734
(speaking in Arabic)

27:35.196 --> 27:37.073
(passengers screaming)

27:45.539 --> 27:47.041
(bones snap)

28:00.971 --> 28:03.516
(passengers gasp)

28:03.557 --> 28:05.726
(overlapping chatter)

28:05.768 --> 28:07.144
All right, everyone,
it's all over.

28:07.186 --> 28:11.524
It's all safe.
You're all gonna be fine.

28:11.565 --> 28:13.150
(cheering, whistling)

28:13.192 --> 28:14.985
WOMAN:
Thank you, Homelander!

28:15.027 --> 28:18.656
Oh, no, no. (laughs)

28:18.697 --> 28:21.200
Come on, now. You guys.

28:21.242 --> 28:23.202
You guys made it.

28:23.244 --> 28:25.079
-You okay, sweetheart?
-Yeah.

28:25.121 --> 28:26.288
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

28:26.330 --> 28:27.289
Good for you.

28:27.331 --> 28:29.625
You guys are amazing, fantastic.

28:29.667 --> 28:30.668
Go, Maeve!

28:30.709 --> 28:32.253
Hey, let's get
a round of applause

28:32.294 --> 28:33.629
for Queen Maeve.

28:33.671 --> 28:34.880
-Yeah!
-(cheering)

28:40.010 --> 28:43.139
Captain?

28:44.557 --> 28:46.142
Stop. Stop.

28:46.183 --> 28:48.018
HOMELANDER: Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, easy, fella.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.604
Take it easy.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.731
There you go, just relax.

28:55.818 --> 28:57.570
(alarm blaring)

29:04.535 --> 29:06.787
ATC!

29:06.829 --> 29:08.497
It's dead!

29:08.539 --> 29:11.125
Can you fly a plane?

29:11.167 --> 29:13.169
Wouldn't matter if I did!

29:16.755 --> 29:18.632
What do we do?

29:27.808 --> 29:30.686
(panicked chatter)

29:30.728 --> 29:32.396
All right, everyone,
remain calm.

29:32.438 --> 29:35.858
Stay in your seats.
Everything's under control.

29:35.900 --> 29:38.736
You got to go out there,
lift the plane up.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.906
Lift the plane? How? (stammers)
There's nothing to stand on.

29:41.947 --> 29:43.115
It's fucking air.

29:43.157 --> 29:44.909
I don't know, fly at it,
ram it straight.

29:44.950 --> 29:49.038
No, that kind of speed, either
the plane goes ass over tit

29:49.079 --> 29:51.040
or I'll punch straight
through the hull, or...

29:51.081 --> 29:54.585
(passengers screaming)

29:54.627 --> 29:57.922
Whoa! Whoa, that was a big one!

29:57.963 --> 30:00.633
Everything's fine,
don't worry about it.

30:03.093 --> 30:06.555
Okay. Okay.

30:06.597 --> 30:09.225
You take everybody, one by one,
you fly them to the ground.

30:09.266 --> 30:13.062
(chuckles) And what?
Come back 123 times?

30:13.103 --> 30:15.105
Maeve, think.

30:18.025 --> 30:20.361
We're done here.

30:20.402 --> 30:23.447
-Please.
-Everything's fine, guys.

30:23.489 --> 30:26.825
-Everything's fine. You're okay.
-Wait, you're leaving us?

30:26.867 --> 30:29.245
No, no, no, no, no. I'm just
seeing something down the back.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.456
Oh, my God, you're leaving.

30:32.498 --> 30:34.208
-He's leaving us.
-I said I'm not...

30:34.250 --> 30:36.919
-(screaming)
-Whoa!

30:36.961 --> 30:38.963
Homelander,
are you going to save us?

30:39.004 --> 30:41.924
Oh, sweetheart, of course
I'm gonna save you,

30:41.966 --> 30:43.592
you betcha.

30:43.634 --> 30:45.678
I'm gonna save everyone here,
don't worry about it.

30:45.719 --> 30:49.473
-Ma'am, relax, hands off me.
-It's okay. It's okay.

30:53.102 --> 30:55.020
Maeve!

30:55.062 --> 30:57.523
(passengers talking, crying)

31:02.611 --> 31:06.365
(screaming)

31:06.407 --> 31:08.826
(alarms blaring)

31:10.619 --> 31:13.038
(screaming, crying)

31:15.207 --> 31:19.378
Okay, you two,
take off your masks. Come on.

31:19.420 --> 31:22.172
Now!

31:25.759 --> 31:27.344
-Take these two!
-No, no.

31:27.386 --> 31:28.929
-Just these two! Please!
-No! What, so they

31:28.971 --> 31:30.431
can tell the world that we left

31:30.472 --> 31:31.890
the rest of them to fucking die?

31:31.932 --> 31:35.019
-Come on!
-No, Maeve. No. You stay back!

31:35.060 --> 31:37.354
All of you, stay back.

31:37.396 --> 31:40.274
You stay the fuck back
or I'll laser you, goddamn it!

31:40.316 --> 31:42.526
I will laser every
fucking one of you!

31:42.568 --> 31:44.903
Stay back!

31:44.945 --> 31:46.905
Let's go.

31:46.947 --> 31:49.992
No, Maeve, no!

31:50.034 --> 31:51.910
-Please stay!
-I'm sorry.

31:51.952 --> 31:53.078
-Take us!
-Maeve!

31:53.120 --> 31:55.664
Please, don't leave us. Please!

31:55.706 --> 31:57.499
GIRL:
Maeve!

31:57.541 --> 32:00.544
Don't die with them.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.379
Maeve.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.632
-What is wrong with you?
-Please, Maeve!

32:04.673 --> 32:07.885
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.678
(crying):
Please take her.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.055
Take my daughter!

32:14.350 --> 32:16.852
-Please! Please take her!
-Please.

32:16.894 --> 32:18.687
MOTHER:
Take her!

32:18.729 --> 32:22.399
(screaming)

32:22.441 --> 32:24.234
(crying)

32:33.869 --> 32:36.872
(screaming)

32:44.046 --> 32:46.048
(indistinct radio chatter)

32:47.383 --> 32:49.343
Oh, look at this.

32:49.385 --> 32:52.513
-Homicide.
-You got here fast.

32:52.554 --> 32:55.516
-Yeah, it was on the squawker.
-What's with the accent?

32:55.557 --> 32:56.975
What's with yours?

32:57.017 --> 33:00.145
You ever seen her here before?

33:00.187 --> 33:03.023
Maybe a year ago.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.071
It's a gang hit.

33:10.823 --> 33:12.783
A gang hit?

33:12.825 --> 33:16.578
-And who told you that, eh?
-I'm not arguing with him.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.747
I'm looking into it.

33:20.082 --> 33:21.667
Excuse me.

33:24.044 --> 33:26.672
Cheers, mate.

33:44.064 --> 33:47.443
A-Train saw me
a fucking week ago.

33:47.484 --> 33:50.946
-What if he made me?
-He didn't see you.

33:50.988 --> 33:53.532
Listen, that's easy for you to
say, Butcher, but I got people.

33:53.574 --> 33:55.701
Oh? And I don't?

33:57.369 --> 34:02.207
Look, Vought don't send a Supe
to do a gang hit, all right?

34:02.249 --> 34:03.792
He was after the female.

34:03.834 --> 34:06.420
Hey, man, who was the woman?

34:06.462 --> 34:08.172
Roberta Cho, mother of four,

34:08.213 --> 34:11.717
loved Mexican food, and smuggled
in a ton of immigrants

34:11.759 --> 34:14.845
-from all over the Pacific.
-Eh, like our girl.

34:14.887 --> 34:16.263
WOMAN:
A-Train, can I get a selfie?

34:16.305 --> 34:17.681
(excited chatter)

34:17.723 --> 34:19.850
WOMAN 2:
I got it.

34:19.892 --> 34:24.313
That wanker can cover
all of Manhattan in 30 minutes.

34:24.354 --> 34:26.315
He's gonna find her
before we do.

34:26.356 --> 34:28.442
No, he won't.
I know where she's going.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.987
Penn Station.

34:32.029 --> 34:35.199
She's working her way backwards.
She's trying to get home.

34:39.286 --> 34:43.540
I'm Ezekiel, and I want you
to join me at the BELIEVE EXPO,

34:43.582 --> 34:45.751
June 6 to 10
at the Fairgrounds.

34:45.793 --> 34:47.711
ANNOUNCER: Sponsored
by Samaritan's Embrace.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.338
EZEKIEL:
We're gonna have music,

34:49.379 --> 34:52.049
we're gonna have worship,
food trucks and,

34:52.090 --> 34:55.636
-oh, yeah, Christ.
-(crowd cheering)

34:55.677 --> 34:59.348
Featuring Homelander
and Starlight from The Seven.

34:59.389 --> 35:01.308
-Hey. (chuckles)
-I know.

35:01.350 --> 35:03.769
Look, I'm not down to convert
the masses or anything,

35:03.811 --> 35:06.688
I'm just--
I'm doing a panel for teens.

35:06.730 --> 35:09.274
And, uh, I'm donating
my appearance fee

35:09.316 --> 35:10.901
to the Covenant House.

35:10.943 --> 35:13.529
You are literally
the nicest person in the city.

35:13.570 --> 35:16.240
No, seriously.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.784
Every other nice person
can fuck off and go home.

35:18.826 --> 35:21.161
I mean, that's why I do it.

35:21.203 --> 35:25.165
Vindictive personal glory.

35:28.293 --> 35:30.838
You okay?

35:30.879 --> 35:34.174
Yeah, yes. Yeah.

35:36.218 --> 35:39.388
You seem a little...

35:39.429 --> 35:41.265
I don't know.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.660
Hmm.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.455
Okay.

36:07.624 --> 36:09.585
I'll come clean.

36:09.626 --> 36:13.005
If I'm being honest...

36:13.046 --> 36:14.590
I'm a little suspicious of you.

36:14.631 --> 36:16.884
You are?

36:16.925 --> 36:20.262
Yeah. I mean,
you say you bowled a lot.

36:20.304 --> 36:23.765
And you know, you have,
like, superpowers,

36:23.807 --> 36:26.476
yet you are
a remarkably shitty bowler.

36:28.645 --> 36:30.606
You know what
I think is happening?

36:30.647 --> 36:33.358
I think you're holding back
for some weird,

36:33.400 --> 36:38.030
"not gonna show me up
on a first date" reason.

36:38.071 --> 36:41.283
You want to quit stroking my ego
and show me what you really got?

36:49.583 --> 36:52.252
Holy shit.

36:54.129 --> 36:56.506
Now that's a strike.

36:58.050 --> 37:00.218
Yeah.

37:00.260 --> 37:02.888
(laughs)

37:02.930 --> 37:04.473
Yeah, that's great, man.

37:04.514 --> 37:06.308
Good looking out. Thanks.

37:06.350 --> 37:08.310
Well? Don't leave us hanging.

37:08.352 --> 37:10.729
Okay, so Deshawn's a brother
that grew up on my block,

37:10.771 --> 37:12.147
but now he delivers packages.

37:12.189 --> 37:13.690
Yeah, not the part
I'm interested in.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.567
He ran down the account number

37:15.609 --> 37:18.528
and the box containing the V
came from Samaritan's Embrace.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.238
Ezekiel's Supe charity?

37:20.280 --> 37:22.824
What the fuck's
that Jesus-thumping,

37:22.866 --> 37:25.077
elastic bastard
got to do with it?

37:25.118 --> 37:28.121
Maybe we find the girl,
we find out.

37:28.163 --> 37:30.123
Yeah. All right.

37:30.165 --> 37:33.085
Platforms, ground floor,
I'll take upstairs.

37:33.126 --> 37:35.003
Whoever pings her, get onto
Frenchie and stick with her

37:35.045 --> 37:36.213
till we use the gas, all right?

37:38.131 --> 37:40.133
(indistinct P.A. announcement)

37:48.809 --> 37:50.769
ANCHOR:
If you're just tuning in,

37:50.811 --> 37:53.480
authorities have lost
all radar and satellite imagery

37:53.522 --> 37:57.484
of hijacked Flight 37
and fear the worst.

37:57.526 --> 37:59.444
Search planes have begun
to fan out

37:59.486 --> 38:01.279
over the flight path
off the Atlantic...

38:01.321 --> 38:03.323
(indistinct chatter)

38:11.748 --> 38:14.334
(song in Japanese playing)

38:34.438 --> 38:36.440
(song continues playing)

39:05.385 --> 39:06.845
-(gasps)
-Non, non.

39:10.474 --> 39:14.186
It's okay. It's gone.

39:14.227 --> 39:17.773
It's gone, you see?

39:17.814 --> 39:20.734
I'm not here to hurt you.

39:26.740 --> 39:28.575
You like music, huh?

39:29.826 --> 39:32.329
Well, me, too.

39:33.914 --> 39:38.376
C-Can I tell you a secret
I never told anyone?

39:43.006 --> 39:46.301
When I was a boy,

39:46.343 --> 39:48.595
my father, he stole me
from Mamma.

39:48.637 --> 39:53.225
In Marseilles, middle of the
night, just broke in, took me.

39:53.266 --> 39:55.227
Kept me with him for years.

39:55.268 --> 39:57.270
Hotel after hotel.

39:57.312 --> 40:01.650
Every few nights,
take me out for a walk.

40:01.691 --> 40:06.196
Smoke a Gauloise,
tell me he loved me, then...

40:12.244 --> 40:15.705
I tried to run away
so many times.

40:20.043 --> 40:23.130
I jumped buses, trains.

40:23.171 --> 40:26.591
Anything to get back
to Marseilles.

40:26.633 --> 40:30.095
To Mamma.

40:30.137 --> 40:33.974
But every time, he find me.

40:37.310 --> 40:40.438
So I know what it's like
to want to go home.

40:47.112 --> 40:50.115
You see, I know your secret.

40:52.325 --> 40:55.162
You're not a bad person.

40:56.204 --> 40:59.749
Just a scared one.

41:06.173 --> 41:08.383
Let me help you.

41:18.059 --> 41:19.561
(TV switches channels)
-...reports of suspicious
activity...

41:26.526 --> 41:27.694
Coming through.

41:33.116 --> 41:35.619
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no...

41:35.660 --> 41:38.413
Frenchie. Did you see her?
Which way did she go?

41:38.455 --> 41:39.831
-I don't know.
-Did you try to gas her?

41:39.873 --> 41:41.166
-No.
-Why not?

41:41.208 --> 41:42.959
-It didn't seem right, huh?
-You went off plan

41:43.001 --> 41:45.921
-because it didn't seem right?
-I'm sorry, okay?

41:48.798 --> 41:52.844
STARLIGHT: Ah, Sean Jakowski.
Cross-country team.

41:52.886 --> 41:56.181
-Mm.
-I had such a huge crush on him,

41:56.223 --> 41:58.558
and he finally asked me out
to this party.

41:58.600 --> 42:01.728
My hair looked cute,
we held hands, it was perfect.

42:01.770 --> 42:04.397
Then, all of a sudden,
this senior shoved Sean,

42:04.439 --> 42:05.815
and then he hit him.

42:05.857 --> 42:08.860
So I stepped in,
I kicked the guy's ass.

42:08.902 --> 42:10.695
-Good for you.
-Mm.

42:10.737 --> 42:12.405
Want to know
how Sean thanked me?

42:12.447 --> 42:14.491
-How?
-Never spoke to me again.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.493
Not one word.

42:16.534 --> 42:19.079
(sighs)
And that's when I learned,

42:19.120 --> 42:22.165
never show your strength
to a boy you like.

42:23.416 --> 42:25.377
Well, to be honest,

42:25.418 --> 42:28.129
Sean Jakowski had
a tiny little baby dick.

42:28.171 --> 42:30.632
(both chuckle)

42:33.134 --> 42:36.304
It doesn't bother you that I
could whip your ass in bowling?

42:36.346 --> 42:39.724
And in everything?

42:39.766 --> 42:41.268
And bench-press you?

42:41.309 --> 42:43.436
Oh, my God, is that
a threat or a promise?

42:43.478 --> 42:47.315
-Hmm.
-And no. No. I-I...

42:47.357 --> 42:52.362
I really think it's awesome,
the real you.

42:56.700 --> 42:59.411
Um, you got... ketchup.

42:59.452 --> 43:01.663
Mm? Oh.

43:01.705 --> 43:04.082
What? You don't like that?

43:04.124 --> 43:06.084
-(chuckles)
-Doesn't work for you?

43:06.126 --> 43:08.128
(laughs)

43:16.261 --> 43:19.222
STARLIGHT: Save my spot.
I'll be right back.

43:19.264 --> 43:22.017
(panting)

43:22.058 --> 43:25.020
(high-pitched ringing)

43:28.606 --> 43:30.608
(indistinct chatter)

43:52.213 --> 43:55.592
-Hey.
-Hey.

43:55.633 --> 43:57.635
(Starlight sighs)

43:59.179 --> 44:01.139
So where's the girl, Frenchie?

44:01.181 --> 44:03.391
Since you're the psycho chick
whisperer all of a sudden.

44:03.433 --> 44:06.394
Maybe subway. Maybe she wants
to find a train, no?

44:06.436 --> 44:08.104
Oh, yeah? How deep up your ass
did you pull that out?

44:08.146 --> 44:09.647
Well, it depends.
How deep does your tongue go?

44:09.689 --> 44:11.274
MOTHER'S MILK:
Listen, you lost her, man.

44:11.316 --> 44:12.942
We had orders,
we're supposed to follow them.

44:12.984 --> 44:14.944
We're professionals
and we count on each other.

44:14.986 --> 44:18.490
But you're on some fucking
bohemian flaky drug shit.

44:18.531 --> 44:20.492
Even Hughie,
who's a fucking white Urkel,

44:20.533 --> 44:22.285
-is more professional than you.
-I understand it's hard

44:22.327 --> 44:24.287
for someone who's anally OCD
to understand.

44:24.329 --> 44:26.081
Okay, then help me
understand, Frenchie.

44:26.122 --> 44:27.582
What happened the night
that Mallory had you

44:27.624 --> 44:29.125
-tail Lamplighter?
-Oh, that's enough.

44:29.167 --> 44:32.462
Mallory was our boss, man.
We had orders.

44:32.504 --> 44:34.089
And you were supposed
to follow him.

44:34.130 --> 44:35.632
You were supposed
to follow Lamplighter,

44:35.673 --> 44:38.468
-tail him, but you let him go.
-I didn't know.

44:38.510 --> 44:40.970
And Lamplighter goes
and torches Mallory's grandkids.

44:41.012 --> 44:43.014
-I didn't know.
-It doesn't matter.

44:43.056 --> 44:46.559
You didn't follow orders
and it costs some lives.

44:47.268 --> 44:48.395
(woman gasps)

44:48.436 --> 44:50.480
Hey, hey. Knock it off.

44:50.522 --> 44:52.899
-Knock it off.
-You know what?

44:52.941 --> 44:54.818
Fuck this, Butcher.

44:54.859 --> 44:57.362
And fuck you. I'm done!

44:57.404 --> 45:00.824
-Stupid fucker...
-M.M., wait.

45:00.865 --> 45:03.785
You said this time
would be different.

45:03.827 --> 45:07.247
But this motherfucker's still
here doing the same old shit.

45:07.288 --> 45:10.708
And we're all gonna
fucking end up like Mallory.

45:10.750 --> 45:13.086
-Yeah, fuck off. Come on.
-Fuck this.

45:13.128 --> 45:14.712
Oi, both of you.

45:14.754 --> 45:16.965
-M.M.
-What?

45:17.006 --> 45:20.218
What's Sporty Spice up to?

45:20.260 --> 45:22.178
Who?

45:22.220 --> 45:24.514
Sporty fucking Spice.
What is she up to?

45:27.809 --> 45:29.394
I don't know.

45:29.436 --> 45:32.021
Exactly. How about Posh?

45:32.063 --> 45:34.190
-You know what she's doing?
-I don't understand.

45:34.232 --> 45:36.734
Making clothes
for anorexics. Right?

45:36.776 --> 45:38.528
Not exactly a growth market.

45:38.570 --> 45:41.739
And Baby?
You know what she's doing?

45:41.781 --> 45:45.452
Fuck all. Not even page six
of the Daily Mail.

45:45.493 --> 45:47.871
And Scary Spice?

45:47.912 --> 45:50.957
Up to her eyeballs
in lawsuits and sex tapes.

45:50.999 --> 45:54.043
Ginger, on the other hand,
has released three albums.

45:54.085 --> 45:58.465
Passion, Schizophonic and
Scream If You Wanna Go Faster.

45:58.506 --> 46:02.051
They'll all make
your ears bleed.

46:02.093 --> 46:04.554
You see, when they're apart,

46:04.596 --> 46:06.556
they're absolute
fucking rubbish.

46:06.598 --> 46:11.686
But, you put them together,

46:11.728 --> 46:15.732
they're the goddamn
fucking Spice Girls.

46:20.361 --> 46:22.739
How do you know so much
about the Spice Girls?

46:22.780 --> 46:27.285
Look, the point is,

46:27.327 --> 46:31.414
that we're all shite
by ourselves.

46:31.456 --> 46:33.291
We need each other.

46:33.333 --> 46:36.878
We need each other, or we're
fucking dead in the water.

46:36.920 --> 46:39.547
Now, you guys can beat
the living fucking shit

46:39.589 --> 46:41.549
out of each other,
I really don't care,

46:41.591 --> 46:44.052
it ain't gonna change the past.

46:49.516 --> 46:53.811
What do you say we go find
that dirty little bitch,

46:53.853 --> 46:57.398
gas her ass,
then get the fuck out of here?

47:01.945 --> 47:04.405
Jesus, he gives
the worst pep talks.

47:04.447 --> 47:06.115
He really, really does.

47:06.157 --> 47:08.618

47:08.660 --> 47:10.745

DEEP:

47:15.833 --> 47:17.627
-(dolphin squeaking)
-That's right.

47:17.669 --> 47:19.212
Next stop, the Atlantic Ocean.

47:19.254 --> 47:21.839
That's right. That's right.

47:21.881 --> 47:24.384
(both laugh)

47:24.425 --> 47:26.010
-What?
-(squeaking)

47:26.052 --> 47:30.014
Okay. Okay, yeah.

47:30.056 --> 47:33.309
I mean, let's just focus on the
escape first and, uh, you know,

47:33.351 --> 47:35.478
we can talk about that
some other time.

47:37.480 --> 47:39.607
-(dolphin squeaking)
-Well, uh, I like you, too.

47:39.649 --> 47:41.276
You know that.

47:41.317 --> 47:43.611
But let's not, you know,
rush into anything too fast.

47:43.653 --> 47:45.989
(squeaking)

47:46.030 --> 47:49.951
All right, seriously,
now is not the appropriate time.

47:49.993 --> 47:52.704
-(groans)
-Plus, you're making things
awkward.

47:52.745 --> 47:55.707
-(squeaks sadly)
-Okay, okay!

47:55.748 --> 47:57.709
If I just touch it,
will you shut up?

47:57.750 --> 47:58.876
(laughs)

47:58.918 --> 48:00.837
-(Deep chuckles)
-(siren wailing)

48:00.878 --> 48:03.798
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.

48:03.840 --> 48:05.550
I made you a promise.

48:05.592 --> 48:07.343

49:18.039 --> 49:19.582
(grunts)

49:33.596 --> 49:35.098
Shit...

49:37.558 --> 49:39.560
(rapid thudding)

49:43.398 --> 49:45.316
-Let's go.
-No, Frenchie.

49:45.358 --> 49:46.984
Forget it, mate. She's fucked.

49:50.113 --> 49:51.698
A-Train!

49:51.739 --> 49:54.033
Over here! Look, everybody!

49:54.075 --> 49:55.451
-It's A-Train right over here!
-WOMAN: A-Train's here?

49:55.493 --> 49:56.994
-MAN: No way.
-Look, it's A-Train!

49:57.036 --> 49:58.955
(indistinct chatter)

49:58.996 --> 50:01.082
(chuckles):
Hey.

50:01.124 --> 50:03.000
MAN 2:
Cool, look who's here.

50:03.042 --> 50:05.586
WOMAN 2:
Shit, what's up, A-Train?

50:05.628 --> 50:06.838
(chuckles)

50:06.879 --> 50:07.839
A-Train, hey.

50:07.880 --> 50:09.298
Hey, can we take a selfie?

50:09.340 --> 50:11.217
Oh, sure, absolutely.

50:11.259 --> 50:13.010
I can take one or two.

50:13.052 --> 50:15.012
MAN 3:
A-Train, over here.

50:29.861 --> 50:32.321
(panting)

50:40.121 --> 50:43.082
No. Let me talk to her.

50:43.124 --> 50:44.917
Don't be fucking stupid.

50:46.753 --> 50:50.339
What if she's a Spice Girl?

50:50.381 --> 50:52.842
Frenchie.

51:13.404 --> 51:15.823
Let me help you go home.

51:27.919 --> 51:29.504
(Frenchie grunting)

51:50.983 --> 51:54.862
She ain't no Spice Girl.

52:09.460 --> 52:11.462
(siren wails)

52:17.260 --> 52:19.262
(indistinct chatter)

52:38.906 --> 52:40.324
Once again,
the horrific wreckage

52:40.366 --> 52:42.451
of Trans-Oceanic Flight 37

52:42.493 --> 52:44.495
just beginning to wash up
on shore.

52:44.537 --> 52:47.665
Every passenger on board
presumed dead.

52:49.917 --> 52:51.919
They didn't have to die.

52:53.546 --> 52:56.132
We have Homelander
and Queen Maeve on the scene.

52:56.173 --> 52:59.135
Do you have a comment?

52:59.176 --> 53:01.846
I said they didn't have to die.

53:01.888 --> 53:05.516
We arrived three minutes
after the plane went down.

53:05.558 --> 53:08.227
And why?
(sighs)

53:08.269 --> 53:10.813
Because we're not
in the chain of command.

53:10.855 --> 53:14.942
If NORAD called us
before they scrambled jets,

53:14.984 --> 53:16.777
(voice breaking):
then we could've saved them.

53:16.819 --> 53:20.781
123 men, women and children.

53:20.823 --> 53:22.825
Excuse me.

53:25.244 --> 53:27.246
(exhales)

53:27.288 --> 53:31.792
But if they let us
into the military,

53:31.834 --> 53:34.795
then this will
never happen again.

53:34.837 --> 53:38.382
That is my solemn promise
to you.

53:38.424 --> 53:40.426
Right, Maeve?

53:42.970 --> 53:44.931
Talk to your congressmen.

53:44.972 --> 53:46.724
Talk to them.
They'll listen to the people.

53:46.766 --> 53:49.226
And together,

53:49.268 --> 53:52.438
together, we will make sure
that this never happens

53:52.480 --> 53:55.483
to our great nation ever again!

53:55.524 --> 53:58.444
(cheering, applause)

53:58.486 --> 54:00.863
God bless you.

54:00.905 --> 54:03.074
God bless America.

54:03.115 --> 54:04.909
-MAN: We hear you, Homelander!
-(cheering, applause)

54:04.951 --> 54:08.120
And I hear you, brother!
I hear you!

54:08.162 --> 54:11.123
-And the world hears you!
-(cheers)

54:11.165 --> 54:15.044
And very, very soon, my friend,

54:15.086 --> 54:18.589
whoever did this to us
will hear from all of us!

54:18.631 --> 54:20.925
CROWD (chanting):
Homelander!

54:20.967 --> 54:24.095
Homelander! Homelander!

54:24.136 --> 54:28.516
Homelander! Homelander!
Homelander!

54:28.557 --> 54:31.978
Homelander! Homelander!

54:32.019 --> 54:36.649
Homelander! Homelander!
Homelander!

54:36.691 --> 54:39.568
Homelander! Homelander!

54:39.610 --> 54:41.570
Homelander!

54:41.612 --> 54:43.614
-(seabirds calling)
-(waves crashing)

54:56.669 --> 54:58.671
(helicopter approaching)

55:19.942 --> 55:21.944
(seabirds calling)

55:51.265 --> 55:53.225
(waves crashing)
