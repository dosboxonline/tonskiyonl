07:37.207 --> 07:39.500
I'll take this moment to

07:37.207 --> 07:39.500
set your minds at ease.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.128
No matter what

07:39.542 --> 07:41.128
the mothership does,

07:41.169 --> 07:43.255
we at Taylor Mason Carbon

07:41.169 --> 07:43.255
will remain autonomous.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.631
You will not be

07:43.297 --> 07:44.631
working for a bank.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.133
All will be resolved.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.592
What about her?

07:47.634 --> 07:50.637
You-- I mean Lauren.

07:50.678 --> 07:52.680
I didn't mean to

07:50.678 --> 07:52.680
just reference you.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.182
You're right there

07:52.722 --> 07:54.182
[chuckles] so--

07:54.224 --> 07:55.892
We all need to stay

07:54.224 --> 07:55.892
focused and united.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.436
Loyalty is doubly important now.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.146
So Lauren isn't

07:57.477 --> 07:59.146
going to the bank.

07:59.187 --> 08:01.856
She'll stay in IR at the

07:59.187 --> 08:01.856
new asset management arm

08:01.898 --> 08:03.275
and stay in place for us.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.832
Hard Bob?

08:18.873 --> 08:20.667
'Lo, Axe.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.837
When last we spoke,

08:20.708 --> 08:23.837
you'd tendered me a position.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.798
Well, now that I find

08:23.878 --> 08:26.798
myself at loose ends,

08:26.840 --> 08:28.842
<i>I was of a mind to claim it.</i>

08:28.883 --> 08:30.718
They bounced you

08:28.883 --> 08:30.718
out of the government

08:30.760 --> 08:32.387
because of your

08:30.760 --> 08:32.387
connection to Krakow?

08:32.429 --> 08:34.848
They did indeed.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.391
But during quarantine,

08:36.433 --> 08:38.393
I became aware of

08:36.433 --> 08:38.393
your new endeavor.

08:38.435 --> 08:40.187
<i>So I've boned up</i>

08:40.228 --> 08:42.397
<i>on all the latest changes</i>

08:40.228 --> 08:42.397
<i>to the banking laws</i>

08:42.439 --> 08:44.399
<i>on the off chance you</i>

08:42.439 --> 08:44.399
<i>need someone to be</i>

08:44.441 --> 08:46.567
<i>your banking</i>

08:44.441 --> 08:46.567
<i>compliance honcho.</i>

08:49.570 --> 08:51.490
Well, get over

08:49.570 --> 08:51.490
to our office

08:51.531 --> 08:54.034
and get started with my CEO.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.411
You got it, Axe.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.800
You two seem banky.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.219
You feelin' banky?

09:12.260 --> 09:14.595
This is...

09:12.260 --> 09:14.595
is this trolling?

09:14.637 --> 09:16.181
Are you trolling us?

09:16.223 --> 09:18.225
He's seeing what

09:16.223 --> 09:18.225
we're made of.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.977
That I am. And you are made

09:18.266 --> 09:20.977
of the stuff of Fort Knox.

09:21.019 --> 09:24.105
Stand by. Assignment's coming

09:21.019 --> 09:24.105
directly from the high chief.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.528
You wanted a reminder;

09:29.569 --> 09:31.530
you have a date with

09:29.569 --> 09:31.530
a Chelsea tonight. 8:00 p.m.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.448
Oh, shit!

09:33.490 --> 09:34.991
I forgot.

09:35.033 --> 09:37.035
No way I can leave

09:35.033 --> 09:37.035
the office now.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.703
This one is important.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.788
I thought the last one was,

09:38.745 --> 09:40.788
but this is crucial.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.623
Take dictation.

09:44.209 --> 09:45.585
Oh, you mean me?

09:45.626 --> 09:47.670
I thought you were

09:45.626 --> 09:47.670
gonna enable Siri.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.797
Just a type a text

09:47.712 --> 09:49.797
to Chelz for me.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.099
The sequel to<i> The Hustler.</i>

09:59.140 --> 10:00.475
<i>Color of Money.</i>

10:00.517 --> 10:02.310
Yes. One of my roommates

10:00.517 --> 10:02.310
from Williams

10:02.352 --> 10:04.438
kept watching it

10:02.352 --> 10:04.438
over and over again.

10:04.479 --> 10:05.980
And I asked him why.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.732
And he said it was

10:06.022 --> 10:07.732
because of the way

10:07.774 --> 10:10.068
the power dynamics

10:07.774 --> 10:10.068
kept switching.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.195
And he never knew

10:10.110 --> 10:12.195
who was zooming who.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.573
Hmm. My college roommates

10:12.237 --> 10:14.573
were mostly just trying

10:14.614 --> 10:16.199
to make one of

10:14.614 --> 10:16.199
those beer harnesses

10:16.241 --> 10:17.909
-you put around your head--

10:16.241 --> 10:17.909
-Yeah, jocks, yes.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.953
But it's the

10:17.951 --> 10:19.953
"Who's zooming whom" part.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.455
That means something

10:19.994 --> 10:21.455
different now.

10:21.496 --> 10:22.997
But you want me

10:21.496 --> 10:22.997
to be eyes up.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.541
I need you to be.

10:24.583 --> 10:27.252
Especially in that

10:24.583 --> 10:27.252
company at that dinner.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.669
And not just at the dinner.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.713
Then that's where they'll be.

10:30.755 --> 10:31.714
Up.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.557
[sizzling]

10:45.770 --> 10:46.938
[Chuck] No, no, no,

10:45.770 --> 10:46.938
don't do that

10:46.980 --> 10:48.022
with your fingers, like that.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.274
No, you forget germs?

10:49.316 --> 10:51.443
I've earned this carrot.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.945
Believe me, you're gonna

10:51.485 --> 10:53.945
give me all the carrots.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.115
Ah-ha, you have news.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.327
Signed NDAs.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.036
We got the offer.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.704
And it's a sweet one.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.457
Suh-weet.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.125
Wendy didn't undersell

11:05.499 --> 11:07.125
the value of her shares

11:07.167 --> 11:08.502
to Taylor Mason Carbon.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.545
Very fair, more than fair.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.422
And she's ready to

11:10.587 --> 11:12.422
strike a payment plan

11:12.464 --> 11:13.923
and write out a check ASAP

11:13.965 --> 11:15.592
to finalize the

11:13.965 --> 11:15.592
divorce settlement.

11:15.634 --> 11:17.469
That's no Cinnabon.

11:17.511 --> 11:20.138
That's a sour cream sandwich

11:17.511 --> 11:20.138
and I'm not biting.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.515
Don't tell me you're

11:20.180 --> 11:21.515
balking at the idea

11:21.556 --> 11:22.974
of her paying you alimony?

11:23.016 --> 11:25.435
I thought we were

11:23.016 --> 11:25.435
well past you realizing

11:25.477 --> 11:26.811
your worth isn't just

11:25.477 --> 11:26.811
measured in dollars.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.355
No, no, no gallantry.

11:28.396 --> 11:29.939
I am past that quaint idea.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.525
What I want is leverage.

11:31.566 --> 11:33.318
To do my own valuation

11:31.566 --> 11:33.318
of Mase Carbon.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.528
Use the offer

11:33.360 --> 11:34.528
to get me that.

11:34.569 --> 11:36.904
You wanna look at

11:34.569 --> 11:36.904
their books.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.906
I want to crawl into them

11:36.946 --> 11:38.906
with my prospector's light.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.659
And, uh, [chuckling]

11:38.948 --> 11:40.659
yeah, well,

11:40.699 --> 11:42.952
I don't wanna call

11:40.699 --> 11:42.952
it a full audit.

11:42.994 --> 11:44.912
Let's just see

11:42.994 --> 11:44.912
how they're cookin' 'em.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.831
It ain't good for you, brother.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.250
You keep at this,

11:46.873 --> 11:49.250
you're gonna pull an embolism

11:49.292 --> 11:52.379
or send your blood pressure

11:49.292 --> 11:52.379
into Alice Kramden territory,

11:52.420 --> 11:55.507
to the moon. Don't do this.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.175
I say as your lawyer

11:55.549 --> 11:57.175
and best friend.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.844
I hear you and I understand.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.180
And at a rational

11:59.886 --> 12:02.180
level, I agree.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.891
And thank you with

12:02.222 --> 12:04.891
an open heart and mind.

12:04.932 --> 12:08.436
But also my open mind

12:04.932 --> 12:08.436
knows this:

12:08.478 --> 12:10.271
you've already

12:08.478 --> 12:10.271
got that demand

12:10.313 --> 12:13.024
for financial

12:10.313 --> 12:13.024
disclosure drawn up

12:13.066 --> 12:14.693
to get me the access

12:13.066 --> 12:14.693
I just asked for.

12:14.733 --> 12:15.694
Don't you?

12:15.734 --> 12:18.029
I know my man. Yeah.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.738
Doesn't mean

12:18.071 --> 12:19.738
I think it's right.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.325
Send the damn disclosure.

12:22.367 --> 12:25.744
And then I'll grab you

12:22.367 --> 12:25.744
a big plate of those carrots.

12:25.786 --> 12:27.539
[sighs]

12:39.593 --> 12:41.094
I signed for this.

12:41.135 --> 12:43.137
I didn't realize

12:41.135 --> 12:43.137
what it was when I did.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.733
Son of a bitch.

12:54.773 --> 12:56.859
You got unplowed fields for me?

12:56.901 --> 12:58.737
The wheat's

12:56.901 --> 12:58.737
a bit thin, but yes.

12:58.777 --> 13:00.821
We look to whence

12:58.777 --> 13:00.821
the bank comes from.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.532
Go back to check cashing

13:00.863 --> 13:02.532
and payday loans

13:02.574 --> 13:04.117
that the original company

13:02.574 --> 13:04.117
was built on.

13:04.158 --> 13:05.410
Not recommended.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.078
Seems a little low-rent.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.996
[Rian]<i> So are the margins.</i>

13:09.038 --> 13:10.749
<i>But then there's frontier</i>

13:09.038 --> 13:10.749
<i>Rapid Growth Markets--</i>

13:10.789 --> 13:12.626
Vietnam, Nigeria, Indonesia.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.753
Lots of money in places like

13:12.667 --> 13:14.753
that looking for a safe home.

13:14.793 --> 13:16.296
I like RGMs.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.838
But what am I supposed to do?

13:17.880 --> 13:19.840
Put our people on planes

13:17.880 --> 13:19.840
and on video conferences

13:19.882 --> 13:22.594
and start negotiations

13:19.882 --> 13:22.594
with economic ministers?

13:22.636 --> 13:25.597
<i>That's a six months</i>

13:22.636 --> 13:25.597
<i>to a year horizon.</i>

13:25.639 --> 13:27.682
There is cannabis money.

13:27.724 --> 13:28.975
<i>Hmm.</i>

13:29.016 --> 13:31.018
Yes.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.979
It's a multi-billion

13:31.060 --> 13:32.979
dollar space

13:33.020 --> 13:35.607
according to our estimates, as

13:33.020 --> 13:35.607
companies in medical marijuana

13:35.649 --> 13:37.108
<i>are ready to expand</i>

13:35.649 --> 13:37.108
<i>into recreational</i>

13:37.150 --> 13:39.152
<i>as it gets legalized</i>

13:37.150 --> 13:39.152
<i>state by state.</i>

13:39.193 --> 13:41.112
Traditional banks

13:39.193 --> 13:41.112
have been reluctant

13:41.154 --> 13:42.697
to take on and

13:41.154 --> 13:42.697
process this cash.

13:42.739 --> 13:45.659
Sure, sure.

13:42.739 --> 13:45.659
I think I love this.

13:45.700 --> 13:46.701
It's got potential.

13:45.700 --> 13:46.701
Unfortunately,

13:46.743 --> 13:48.035
it's a yellow light.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.912
A great opportunity,

13:48.077 --> 13:49.912
but not safe yet

13:49.954 --> 13:52.332
until such time as federal

13:49.954 --> 13:52.332
legislation changes.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.833
It wasn't even supposed

13:52.373 --> 13:54.833
to be mentioned in this meeting.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.294
<i>Yeah, but you did.</i>

13:56.336 --> 13:57.796
<i>Send me everything</i>

13:56.336 --> 13:57.796
<i>you have on it.</i>

14:06.845 --> 14:08.723
[door closes]

14:11.225 --> 14:12.560
Mr. Prince,

14:12.602 --> 14:15.229
I am pleased

14:12.602 --> 14:15.229
that my invitation--

14:15.271 --> 14:16.606
This is an

14:15.271 --> 14:16.606
impressive group.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.733
I hope the intention

14:16.648 --> 14:18.733
is as serious

14:18.775 --> 14:21.277
as I was led to believe,

14:18.775 --> 14:21.277
Mr. Rhoades.

14:21.319 --> 14:23.530
Serious and elevating,

14:21.319 --> 14:23.530
I trust.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.448
And, uh,

14:23.571 --> 14:25.448
call me Chuck, please.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.825
And you call me Mike.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.075
All of you.

14:28.117 --> 14:31.329
Well, welcome

14:28.117 --> 14:31.329
to my home, Mike.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.456
And to this chapter

14:33.498 --> 14:35.542
of a great tradition,

14:35.583 --> 14:37.711
the Jeffersonian dinner.

14:37.752 --> 14:41.005
A further evolution of

14:37.752 --> 14:41.005
it anyway, aided by WebEx.

14:42.173 --> 14:44.384
Though separated

14:42.173 --> 14:44.384
by circumstance,

14:44.425 --> 14:47.970
there's no reason our exchange

14:44.425 --> 14:47.970
of ideas has to be-- Ah!

14:48.012 --> 14:50.223
And we will dine

14:50.264 --> 14:52.058
as the founders did,

14:52.099 --> 14:53.810
with heritage birds.

14:53.852 --> 14:56.354
Has the same unaltered genetic

14:53.852 --> 14:56.354
makeup as the turkeys

14:56.396 --> 14:59.566
that roam the Shenandoah Valley

14:56.396 --> 14:59.566
in Long Tom's day,

14:59.607 --> 15:02.527
as my remote emissaries

14:59.607 --> 15:02.527
have set up for you.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.529
Yes, thank you very much.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.740
I'm surprised you're not

15:04.571 --> 15:06.740
in a powdered wig and tricorn.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.700
<i>Don't think he</i>

15:06.781 --> 15:08.700
<i>didn't consider it.</i>

15:08.742 --> 15:10.284
[all chuckle]

15:10.326 --> 15:12.495
We will honor this custom

15:10.326 --> 15:12.495
going back to the days

15:12.537 --> 15:14.831
of the founders

15:12.537 --> 15:14.831
when leading citizens,

15:14.873 --> 15:17.542
both public and private,

15:17.584 --> 15:21.462
reviewed and sometimes

15:17.584 --> 15:21.462
set the agenda of the day.

15:21.504 --> 15:24.382
This will be a

15:21.504 --> 15:24.382
"one mind" conversation

15:24.424 --> 15:26.092
with everyone taking turns,

15:26.133 --> 15:29.011
no real interlocution

15:26.133 --> 15:29.011
or crosstalk except by me.

15:29.053 --> 15:31.013
I will be our guide.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.349
And tonight's topic is...

15:34.517 --> 15:35.852
Liberty.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.910
-Liberty, law.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.910
-[phone vibrates]

15:56.915 --> 15:59.500
Big words to unpack.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.711
Either could be

15:59.542 --> 16:01.711
a night's work. A week's.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.546
It's like trying to understand

16:01.753 --> 16:03.546
the difference in tone

16:03.588 --> 16:05.256
between<i> Match Game</i> and

16:03.588 --> 16:05.256
<i>Match Game, PM.</i>

16:05.298 --> 16:06.758
-[chuckles]

16:05.298 --> 16:06.758
-Well, the key there was

16:06.800 --> 16:08.802
which ascot Charles

16:06.800 --> 16:08.802
Nelson Reilly wore,

16:08.843 --> 16:10.470
but this is not the

16:08.843 --> 16:10.470
time to look into that

16:10.511 --> 16:11.471
or the question.

16:11.512 --> 16:14.140
Again, no cross talk.

16:14.181 --> 16:17.017
Um, and we will keep

16:14.181 --> 16:17.017
to Chatham House rule.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.979
So, uh, you can use

16:17.059 --> 16:19.979
any info you glean here,

16:20.020 --> 16:21.355
but not for attribution.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.441
Can I get a nod

16:21.397 --> 16:23.441
of assent to same?

16:23.483 --> 16:26.193
-[Vandeveer]<i> Of course.</i>

16:23.483 --> 16:26.193
-[phone vibrates]

16:26.235 --> 16:28.696
[Chuck] Uh, premise.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.281
-Two ways...

16:28.738 --> 16:30.281
<i>-I tried him, but</i>

16:30.323 --> 16:32.533
you're the one who

16:30.323 --> 16:32.533
sent me this garbage.

16:32.575 --> 16:36.913
[Chuck] ...uh, banking laws

16:32.575 --> 16:36.913
are a threat to liberty or

16:36.955 --> 16:39.833
<i>banks without regulation are</i>

16:36.955 --> 16:39.833
<i>the true threat to liberty.</i>

16:39.874 --> 16:42.794
<i>First, are we</i>

16:39.874 --> 16:42.794
<i>a people at liberty?</i>

16:42.836 --> 16:44.963
<i>Then, are we free to bank</i>

16:45.004 --> 16:47.089
-how we want?

16:45.004 --> 16:47.089
-[Sweeney]<i> Right, yeah.</i>

16:47.131 --> 16:48.716
<i>I have some thoughts on this.</i>

16:48.758 --> 16:50.760
<i>Um, freedom...</i>

16:50.802 --> 16:52.595
Chuck, you need to take this.

16:52.637 --> 16:54.514
<i>Let's start with the,</i>

16:52.637 --> 16:54.514
<i>uh, premise that--</i>

16:54.555 --> 16:56.432
It's a reflex. She calls,

16:54.555 --> 16:56.432
I have to answer. It's Wendy.

16:56.474 --> 16:58.852
[sighs]

17:00.227 --> 17:01.813
<i>We need to talk.</i>

17:01.855 --> 17:05.024
-Can't it wait?

17:01.855 --> 17:05.024
-You didn't.

17:05.065 --> 17:08.528
Uh, folks, I'll need

17:05.065 --> 17:08.528
a moment before

17:08.569 --> 17:10.363
we continue our colloquy.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.993
I'm in the midst

17:13.032 --> 17:14.993
of a Jeffersonian dinner.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.286
<i>You hit me with</i>

17:15.034 --> 17:17.286
<i>a goddamn subpoena.</i>

17:17.328 --> 17:18.663
A demand for disclosure

17:18.705 --> 17:20.247
<i>as is within my rights.</i>

17:20.289 --> 17:21.916
I care not a whit,

17:20.289 --> 17:21.916
as you might put it.

17:21.958 --> 17:23.668
What I<i> do</i> care about

17:21.958 --> 17:23.668
is what are you trying

17:23.710 --> 17:25.085
to get out of this

17:23.710 --> 17:25.085
look under the hood?

17:26.420 --> 17:27.881
Fair play.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.966
Getting what I am owed.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.966
Simple as that.

17:30.008 --> 17:32.010
We had an independent valuator

17:30.008 --> 17:32.010
come up with that number.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.887
Our very own Jonathan Mardukas.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.722
Who knows what

17:33.928 --> 17:35.722
kind of circles

17:35.763 --> 17:37.640
your in-house accountant

17:35.763 --> 17:37.640
spun him in?

17:37.682 --> 17:39.642
<i>No. This is about control</i>

17:39.684 --> 17:41.352
over me one last time.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.354
Or is it part of your

17:41.394 --> 17:43.354
endless pursuit of Axe?

17:43.396 --> 17:44.689
-Hmm.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.689
<i>-What, you want a Trojan Horse</i>

17:44.731 --> 17:45.940
<i>into his books?</i>

17:45.982 --> 17:48.108
No plan.

17:45.982 --> 17:48.108
Do you want to be done?

17:48.150 --> 17:49.694
Then let's be done.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.694
Pay me off.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.488
Lump sum in the

17:49.736 --> 17:52.488
next 48 hours.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.574
[scoffs] Forty-eight hours?

17:54.615 --> 17:56.617
For that kind of money?

17:56.659 --> 17:59.119
<i>Or I'll be in first thing</i>

17:56.659 --> 17:59.119
<i>next week to take a gander.</i>

17:59.161 --> 18:00.955
Or a perusal.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.498
Or maybe I'll just take

18:00.997 --> 18:02.498
a piece of the company. Hmm?

18:02.540 --> 18:04.208
There's no way that's happening.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.752
<i>These are reasonable options.</i>

18:05.793 --> 18:07.336
It's either the

18:05.793 --> 18:07.336
Burt Reynolds Spreader

18:07.378 --> 18:09.005
or a go-away pay off.

18:09.047 --> 18:10.882
<i>The divorce judge</i>

18:09.047 --> 18:10.882
<i>will see that as fair.</i>

18:10.924 --> 18:12.633
Because it is.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.272
Hi.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.315
Chelz, welcome.

18:31.402 --> 18:34.030
I'm so glad you're here.

18:31.402 --> 18:34.030
Come with me.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.662
[chuckles]

18:41.704 --> 18:42.872
I'm sorry I couldn't

18:41.704 --> 18:42.872
get away, but...

18:42.914 --> 18:44.331
I didn't wanna cancel.

18:44.373 --> 18:46.250
More like you're

18:44.373 --> 18:46.250
worried people my age

18:46.292 --> 18:47.668
have a short attention span

18:47.710 --> 18:49.545
and I would forget

18:47.710 --> 18:49.545
about you,

18:49.587 --> 18:51.297
if you canceled.

18:51.338 --> 18:53.800
But don't stress.

18:51.338 --> 18:53.800
You've got my attention.

18:55.635 --> 18:56.594
At least for now.

18:57.929 --> 19:00.180
Is this weird?

19:00.222 --> 19:01.682
I hope it's not weird.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.644
It's a little weird.

19:05.770 --> 19:06.687
Cheers.

19:07.563 --> 19:08.940
Cheers.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.858
<i>I need you to</i>

19:08.982 --> 19:10.858
<i>go after gold,</i>

19:10.900 --> 19:12.819
<i>gold deposits that is.</i>

19:12.860 --> 19:16.155
<i>We get credits for</i>

19:12.860 --> 19:16.155
<i>FDIC-insured deposits.</i>

19:16.196 --> 19:19.117
But there's a limit of

19:16.196 --> 19:19.117
250K per account.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.243
So I need you to call

19:19.158 --> 19:21.243
everybody on the master list

19:21.285 --> 19:23.287
who's got more than that

19:23.329 --> 19:25.790
and make 'em break down their

19:23.329 --> 19:25.790
accounts into multiple accounts

19:25.832 --> 19:27.583
of under 250.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.127
Put 'em in their

19:27.625 --> 19:29.127
wives' names, kids' names,

19:29.168 --> 19:31.545
businesses, LLCs, corps.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.756
<i>That sounds...</i>

19:33.798 --> 19:35.257
<i>well, I'll just say it.</i>

19:35.299 --> 19:37.010
<i>Over the line.</i>

19:37.051 --> 19:40.596
In our world, you're either

19:37.051 --> 19:40.596
driven by greed or fear.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.015
If you picked fear,

19:42.056 --> 19:42.974
I don't know why

19:42.056 --> 19:42.974
you're even in

19:43.016 --> 19:44.183
that fucking building.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.730
[computer beeps]

19:49.772 --> 19:51.607
I gotta take a call.

19:49.772 --> 19:51.607
So go get creative.

19:52.984 --> 19:54.694
<i>Did you get my text?</i>

19:54.735 --> 19:56.696
-So who's there?

19:54.735 --> 19:56.696
<i>-Chuck's at the head.</i>

19:56.737 --> 19:58.572
-Of course.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.572
<i>-Ira was next to him</i>

19:58.614 --> 20:00.199
<i>and Prince on the other side.</i>

20:00.240 --> 20:02.284
-Son of a bitch.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.284
<i>-That's what I said.</i>

20:02.326 --> 20:03.995
Senator Vanderveer

20:02.326 --> 20:03.995
and Governor Sweeney

20:04.037 --> 20:05.329
and the rest of them

20:04.037 --> 20:05.329
were up on the board.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.165
They were sitting

20:05.371 --> 20:07.165
down to dinner,

20:07.206 --> 20:09.750
but it looked like a major

20:07.206 --> 20:09.750
fuckin' initiative to me.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.251
There was an empty seat, too.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.251
I'm not sure for who.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.295
I-- I couldn't see the placard.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.840
<i>So tell me exactly what it was</i>

20:13.337 --> 20:15.840
<i>you overheard Chuck saying.</i>

20:15.882 --> 20:18.217
"Premise, two ways.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.178
Banking laws

20:18.258 --> 20:20.178
are a threat to liberty,

20:20.219 --> 20:22.138
or banks without

20:20.219 --> 20:22.138
regulation are

20:22.180 --> 20:23.890
the true threat to liberty."

20:23.931 --> 20:26.308
<i>First, are we</i>

20:23.931 --> 20:26.308
<i>a people at liberty?</i>

20:26.350 --> 20:28.895
<i>Then, are we free</i>

20:26.350 --> 20:28.895
<i>to bank how we want?</i>

20:28.936 --> 20:30.938
Yeah, premise.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.606
It's a fucking attack on me.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.192
I'm gonna Sherlock

20:32.648 --> 20:34.192
Holmes this thing

20:34.233 --> 20:35.275
until I figure it out.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.374
Yeah?

20:50.416 --> 20:52.043
[Axe]<i> I'm calling you</i>

20:50.416 --> 20:52.043
<i>as my banking trustee.</i>

20:52.085 --> 20:54.545
Seems like your son

20:52.085 --> 20:54.545
is having a soiree tonight.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.047
And your invite must have

20:56.089 --> 20:58.382
<i>gotten caught up</i>

20:56.089 --> 20:58.382
<i>in the spam filter.</i>

20:58.424 --> 21:00.885
Feels like it's

20:58.424 --> 21:00.885
a meeting of my enemies

21:00.927 --> 21:02.511
arrayed against me.

21:02.553 --> 21:05.389
So I need you to crash

21:02.553 --> 21:05.389
and send me dispatches.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.474
Copy that.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.435
Doc, am I game ready?

21:10.728 --> 21:12.813
Like Julius Erving in 76, baby.

21:12.855 --> 21:14.190
[chuckles]

21:14.774 --> 21:15.816
In.

21:15.858 --> 21:17.526
Good.

21:17.568 --> 21:19.278
I know I said,

21:17.568 --> 21:19.278
I'd take you to

21:19.319 --> 21:20.738
Tom Colicchoi's new restaurant.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.782
-Yeah.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.782
-But don't be disappointed.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.744
I brought Tom Colicchio to you.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.497
-Hey, Wags. How you doin'?

21:28.704 --> 21:30.497
-[Wags] Chef.

21:30.539 --> 21:31.958
Good evening.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.210
So this is a dish

21:31.999 --> 21:34.210
that I created back

21:34.252 --> 21:35.878
when I was at Gramercy Tavern,

21:35.920 --> 21:37.588
and I thought I'd revive

21:35.920 --> 21:37.588
it for this evening.

21:37.630 --> 21:40.340
It's a pea purée with

21:37.630 --> 21:40.340
a fondue of crab.

21:40.382 --> 21:41.383
There's some bacon,

21:41.425 --> 21:42.802
a little bit of sumac,

21:42.843 --> 21:44.887
and pink peppercorns. Enjoy.

21:44.929 --> 21:46.180
Chef, you're a genius.

21:46.222 --> 21:47.556
Thank you.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.727
[sniffs] Hmm. Smell that broth.

21:52.352 --> 21:53.896
Uh-mm.

21:53.938 --> 21:55.731
Wagner.

21:55.773 --> 21:57.984
I'm here to get you ship-shape

21:55.773 --> 21:57.984
on banking regulation.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.070
Hard Bob.

22:01.112 --> 22:03.322
I thought the usual whiff

22:01.112 --> 22:03.322
of bullshit had dissipated.

22:03.363 --> 22:07.201
My mind is a repository

22:03.363 --> 22:07.201
of FDIC rules and regs.

22:07.243 --> 22:08.619
I don't need any help.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.537
But I will certainly

22:08.661 --> 22:10.537
ask you if I do.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.999
How will fee structure

22:10.579 --> 22:12.999
and annual percentage rate

22:13.040 --> 22:16.002
calculations be

22:13.040 --> 22:16.002
disclosed to consumers

22:16.043 --> 22:19.880
to ensure compliance with

22:16.043 --> 22:19.880
the truth in lending statutes?

22:22.716 --> 22:25.303
Let's not bore the lady

22:22.716 --> 22:25.303
with these tedious questions.

22:25.343 --> 22:26.679
Come with me.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.889
I will parry these

22:26.720 --> 22:28.889
softballs and more.

22:30.141 --> 22:31.684
Let me handle this tinhorn.

22:31.725 --> 22:33.769
Why don't you make

22:31.725 --> 22:33.769
a TikTok or something?

22:35.896 --> 22:39.025
How would you ensure that

22:35.896 --> 22:39.025
error resolution policies

22:39.066 --> 22:40.609
remain within

22:39.066 --> 22:40.609
the guidelines of--

22:40.651 --> 22:41.986
Look, you've made your point.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.612
I'm lost in the fuckin' weeds.

22:43.654 --> 22:45.156
I need you to coach me.

22:45.198 --> 22:48.284
But privately, not in

22:45.198 --> 22:48.284
front of my lady friend.

22:48.326 --> 22:49.618
I will have the

22:48.326 --> 22:49.618
documents brought to you,

22:49.660 --> 22:51.996
and we can start tomorrow.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.497
All right.

22:54.915 --> 22:57.793
[Ben] Hey, Wags,

22:54.915 --> 22:57.793
can you come down?

22:57.835 --> 23:01.297
Look, in business, I've always

22:57.835 --> 23:01.297
been a fan of proper regulation.

23:01.339 --> 23:02.506
A level playing field.

23:02.548 --> 23:05.051
I feed on fair competition.

23:05.092 --> 23:07.803
And I feel the same way about

23:05.092 --> 23:07.803
my latest venture, Hypercube,

23:07.845 --> 23:09.471
which is the digital equivalent

23:09.513 --> 23:11.682
of a brick-and-mortar bank

23:09.513 --> 23:11.682
for today and beyond.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.185
So for the purposes

23:11.724 --> 23:14.185
of our conversation,

23:14.227 --> 23:16.020
I'll call myself a banker.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.479
And as such, I have to say,

23:17.521 --> 23:19.106
there must be a limit

23:17.521 --> 23:19.106
to the strangling

23:19.148 --> 23:21.234
regulation certain

23:19.148 --> 23:21.234
factions propose--

23:21.275 --> 23:22.151
[Senior] Whoa...

23:22.193 --> 23:23.527
Sorry to interrupt.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.654
I thought we had

23:23.569 --> 23:25.654
plans tonight, son.

23:25.696 --> 23:28.199
Must have gotten

23:25.696 --> 23:28.199
my dates crossed.

23:28.241 --> 23:29.449
-[chuckling]

23:28.241 --> 23:29.449
-No, we didn't, Dad.

23:29.491 --> 23:30.910
We have none.

23:30.951 --> 23:33.662
Marcia, you look radiant.

23:33.704 --> 23:36.749
<i>And you look the picture</i>

23:33.704 --> 23:36.749
<i>of health, Charles.</i>

23:36.790 --> 23:38.209
Oh, that's thanks to me.

23:38.251 --> 23:39.543
He's my medical man.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.045
Yeah, I keep his

23:39.585 --> 23:41.045
meds straight,

23:41.087 --> 23:42.629
his rod straighter

23:41.087 --> 23:42.629
and his nose clean.

23:42.671 --> 23:44.464
Well, that part's up to him.

23:44.506 --> 23:46.592
Well, uh, [chuckles]

23:46.633 --> 23:49.636
now that you're here, you

23:46.633 --> 23:49.636
might as well post up there.

23:49.678 --> 23:52.932
Really? No, I-- I don't want

23:49.678 --> 23:52.932
to put you to any trouble.

23:52.973 --> 23:54.392
Dad, I'm sorry,

23:52.973 --> 23:54.392
it's a private affair,

23:54.432 --> 23:56.560
but you can get a plate

23:54.432 --> 23:56.560
and fall back.

23:56.602 --> 23:59.563
And our event has

23:56.602 --> 23:59.563
a strict subset of rules.

23:59.605 --> 24:02.858
So I'm going to have

23:59.605 --> 24:02.858
to insist on your silence.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.278
-I'm Helen fucking Keller.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.278
-Mmm.

24:08.488 --> 24:11.367
Well, Dad, it's great

24:08.488 --> 24:11.367
to have you with us.

24:11.409 --> 24:13.327
-[chuckles]

24:11.409 --> 24:13.327
-I can't believe

24:13.369 --> 24:14.954
you fuckin' showed

24:13.369 --> 24:14.954
up here uninvited.

24:14.995 --> 24:17.081
The only reason

24:14.995 --> 24:17.081
I'm not kicking you out

24:17.123 --> 24:19.166
is 'cause I can't do that

24:17.123 --> 24:19.166
in front of my vaunted guests.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.252
Then I guess when

24:19.208 --> 24:21.252
it comes to whist,

24:21.294 --> 24:23.296
I'm still the one takin'

24:21.294 --> 24:23.296
the most tricks.

24:23.337 --> 24:24.755
[scoffs]

24:34.681 --> 24:36.725
So...

24:36.767 --> 24:38.978
what are we choppin' up?

24:39.019 --> 24:43.190
-[typing]

24:39.019 --> 24:43.190
-[phone vibrates]

24:43.232 --> 24:44.442
[sniffs]

24:44.482 --> 24:46.319
Talk to me.

24:46.360 --> 24:47.945
Yeah, Axe, it's

24:46.360 --> 24:47.945
the fucking doctor.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.281
I got a message for

24:47.987 --> 24:50.281
you from the patient.

24:50.323 --> 24:53.491
The Prince is takin'

24:50.323 --> 24:53.491
it to the bank.

24:53.533 --> 24:55.202
Is anybody listening

24:53.533 --> 24:55.202
to you there?

24:55.244 --> 24:57.371
-No.

24:55.244 --> 24:57.371
-Then don't speak in code.

24:57.413 --> 25:01.292
I'm saying the Prince

24:57.413 --> 25:01.292
is taking it to the--

25:01.334 --> 25:03.585
You mean he has a bank?

25:01.334 --> 25:03.585
Prince does?

25:03.627 --> 25:05.004
Okay, you know what?

25:03.627 --> 25:05.004
We're gonna do

25:05.045 --> 25:06.297
a quick little

25:05.045 --> 25:06.297
hearing test when we meet.

25:06.339 --> 25:07.173
No, we're not.

25:18.476 --> 25:19.935
[Chuck] I have just

25:18.476 --> 25:19.935
received reassurance

25:19.977 --> 25:22.229
that Judge DeGiulio

25:19.977 --> 25:22.229
is still coming.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.856
So are we expected to go on

25:23.897 --> 25:25.523
like we're in colonial

25:23.897 --> 25:25.523
times until he does,

25:25.565 --> 25:26.900
or can we have a

25:25.565 --> 25:26.900
regular conversation?

25:26.942 --> 25:28.819
No one forced you to come.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.988
I-- I have to admit

25:28.861 --> 25:30.988
I took pause at having

25:31.030 --> 25:32.990
a stark raving capitalist

25:31.030 --> 25:32.990
here in the first place.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.492
But then I listened to

25:34.532 --> 25:36.785
some of our esteemed

25:34.532 --> 25:36.785
guests and relented.

25:36.827 --> 25:38.578
An Attorney General

25:36.827 --> 25:38.578
who actually listens.

25:38.620 --> 25:39.830
A novel concept for our age.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.463
We have to deal

25:45.794 --> 25:47.463
with this [sighs]...

25:47.505 --> 25:49.006
directly.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.841
You said, "Yellow light" to Axe.

25:50.883 --> 25:53.052
But the research I gave you said

25:50.883 --> 25:53.052
clearly that cannabis money

25:53.093 --> 25:54.803
is a red light for banks

25:53.093 --> 25:54.803
at this moment.

25:54.845 --> 25:55.971
We agreed we wouldn't

25:54.845 --> 25:55.971
even pitch it.

25:56.013 --> 25:57.597
And that was after I said

25:57.639 --> 25:58.807
I didn't want to pitch

25:57.639 --> 25:58.807
anything bank-related

25:58.849 --> 26:00.684
but you said we had to,

26:00.726 --> 26:02.395
-so I-- I don't understand.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.395
-And now you wanna know what?

26:02.436 --> 26:04.604
Why throw the scroogie when

26:02.436 --> 26:04.604
you called for the heater?

26:04.646 --> 26:07.358
I-- I pitched softball

26:04.646 --> 26:07.358
for one season in college.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.984
My out pitch was

26:07.400 --> 26:08.984
a sinker dropped off

26:09.026 --> 26:10.819
the table like a brick.

26:10.861 --> 26:12.821
And yeah, if my catcher and

26:10.861 --> 26:12.821
I got crossed up like that,

26:12.863 --> 26:14.490
I'd expect her

26:12.863 --> 26:14.490
to come to the mound.

26:14.532 --> 26:15.908
As I am.

26:15.949 --> 26:17.826
Why give wrong info

26:15.949 --> 26:17.826
to the Axe Man?

26:17.868 --> 26:19.703
We didn't tell him to buy.

26:19.745 --> 26:22.039
Are you working against him?

26:19.745 --> 26:22.039
For yourself?

26:23.832 --> 26:25.583
I can't help

26:23.832 --> 26:25.583
if I don't know.

26:25.625 --> 26:27.127
Are you going to

26:25.625 --> 26:27.127
make sure Mase Carbon

26:27.169 --> 26:28.379
stays independent

26:27.169 --> 26:28.379
no matter what?

26:28.421 --> 26:30.923
This is the "trust me" piece.

26:30.964 --> 26:33.384
As a person? Or as a boss?

26:33.426 --> 26:35.593
Like in one of those

26:33.426 --> 26:35.593
good sushi places

26:35.635 --> 26:36.512
where they won't

26:35.635 --> 26:36.512
make substitutions

26:36.554 --> 26:38.347
or California rolls.

26:38.389 --> 26:40.766
You're in safe hands when

26:38.389 --> 26:40.766
I serve you the quail egg.

26:40.807 --> 26:42.976
Uh... I'm not working

26:40.807 --> 26:42.976
for a bank.

26:43.018 --> 26:46.439
Banks are bad. Not good bad

26:43.018 --> 26:46.439
or fun bad, just bad.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.565
And boring.

26:47.647 --> 26:50.276
I give you my word.

26:50.317 --> 26:52.652
We'll see what that's worth.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.869
Thanks for the intel on Chuck's.

27:00.911 --> 27:03.289
I think I'm starting to

27:00.911 --> 27:03.289
know what's going on.

27:05.165 --> 27:06.708
I owe you.

27:09.587 --> 27:14.550
<i>So... I admit it. Yes.</i>

27:14.592 --> 27:16.427
<i>The Tanner thing was about you.</i>

27:18.596 --> 27:21.056
<i>I just thought, this guy's</i>

27:18.596 --> 27:21.056
<i>full of shit. Marketable.</i>

27:21.098 --> 27:24.726
But a dime-store Pollock with

27:21.098 --> 27:24.726
a full head of greasy hair.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.979
And I wanted you to

27:24.768 --> 27:26.979
see it sooner than later

27:27.020 --> 27:28.481
before you got badly hurt.

27:28.522 --> 27:31.150
So I--I exposed him.

27:31.191 --> 27:33.860
You'd have seen it within

27:31.191 --> 27:33.860
weeks if I did nothing.

27:36.029 --> 27:38.198
If that's true,

27:36.029 --> 27:38.198
I could see my way

27:38.240 --> 27:39.575
to appreciating...

27:39.617 --> 27:43.078
<i>it... the intent,</i>

27:43.120 --> 27:45.038
but... [scoffs]

27:45.080 --> 27:46.790
-There are other ways.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.790
<i>-Yeah, now look,</i>

27:46.832 --> 27:48.584
<i>I am not saying</i>

27:46.832 --> 27:48.584
<i>I was thinking clearly</i>

27:48.626 --> 27:50.836
or that I even knew,

27:48.626 --> 27:50.836
exactly, what I was doing.

27:50.877 --> 27:53.130
But since you mentioned

27:50.877 --> 27:53.130
it this morning,

27:54.672 --> 27:56.716
you know, I've been

27:54.672 --> 27:56.716
chewing on it.

27:56.758 --> 27:58.802
So I had to tell you.

28:00.053 --> 28:01.430
[knocking]

28:01.472 --> 28:04.517
Sorry to interrupt.

28:01.472 --> 28:04.517
But I need you.

28:04.558 --> 28:05.767
<i>You looking for me, Orrin?</i>

28:05.809 --> 28:07.769
Not you. Her.

28:07.811 --> 28:10.523
Okay. Well, Wend,

28:10.564 --> 28:13.108
you and I will finish

28:10.564 --> 28:13.108
this convo later.

28:13.150 --> 28:15.402
That we will.

28:18.989 --> 28:20.949
You don't have

28:18.989 --> 28:20.949
the liquid assets

28:20.991 --> 28:22.742
to pay out Chuck,

28:20.991 --> 28:22.742
lump sum right now.

28:22.784 --> 28:26.497
I can fight off his demand

28:22.784 --> 28:26.497
for a week or so, but...

28:26.539 --> 28:28.582
he's going to get in.

28:43.347 --> 28:46.141
I see the trading of blows

28:43.347 --> 28:46.141
has begun already.

28:46.183 --> 28:48.268
Don't tell me I

28:46.183 --> 28:48.268
caught you off guard?

28:48.310 --> 28:50.396
I just want to make sure you are

28:48.310 --> 28:50.396
ready to parry my attack.

28:51.438 --> 28:53.232
Like Louden Swain himself.

28:53.273 --> 28:54.650
And I want to make sure

28:53.273 --> 28:54.650
you are able

28:54.692 --> 28:56.443
to deliver

28:54.692 --> 28:56.443
the Solicitor General.

28:56.485 --> 28:57.861
He's pretty darn key here.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.863
To our own vision quest, yes.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.948
DeGiulio will be here.

29:01.990 --> 29:04.201
But as to where he'll land,

29:01.990 --> 29:04.201
I am less confident.

29:04.243 --> 29:05.952
He's formidable.

29:04.243 --> 29:05.952
A veritable Shute.

29:05.994 --> 29:08.788
I'll get his shoulders down

29:05.994 --> 29:08.788
for the three count.

29:08.830 --> 29:11.208
Best of luck

29:08.830 --> 29:11.208
to you on that.

29:21.218 --> 29:23.303
I haven't seen you

29:21.218 --> 29:23.303
leave your office.

29:23.345 --> 29:25.681
Is that your way of asking

29:23.345 --> 29:25.681
if I've had dinner?

29:25.723 --> 29:27.933
You're usually more direct.

29:27.974 --> 29:29.602
To go see Axe.

29:29.643 --> 29:30.728
To tell him that you're

29:29.643 --> 29:30.728
choosing Mase Carb.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.104
I'm considering his offer

29:32.145 --> 29:34.856
to work for Axe Bank.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.400
I see.

29:36.442 --> 29:37.901
When you factor in your bonus,

29:37.943 --> 29:39.319
you'd make less there

29:37.943 --> 29:39.319
than you do here.

29:39.361 --> 29:40.654
What tempts you

29:39.361 --> 29:40.654
about his offer that

29:40.696 --> 29:42.114
I won't be able to match?

29:42.155 --> 29:43.990
Stability.

29:44.032 --> 29:46.076
Working here, we're always

29:44.032 --> 29:46.076
fighting for our lives.

29:46.118 --> 29:48.120
Don't get me wrong,

29:46.118 --> 29:48.120
I love a challenge,

29:48.161 --> 29:50.372
the thrill of a big win

29:48.161 --> 29:50.372
when we land new money.

29:50.414 --> 29:52.666
Oof, it's like hitting

29:50.414 --> 29:52.666
your number in roulette

29:52.708 --> 29:55.085
and letting it ride.

29:52.708 --> 29:55.085
But you keep that up and--

29:55.127 --> 29:58.213
You'd rather be the house.

29:58.255 --> 30:00.466
You don't ask me a lot

29:58.255 --> 30:00.466
about my life before we met,

30:00.507 --> 30:02.217
and I like that.

30:02.259 --> 30:04.762
I figure your own past is

30:02.259 --> 30:04.762
full of difficult memories

30:04.803 --> 30:06.597
you'd rather not retread,

30:06.639 --> 30:08.181
and you're extending me

30:06.639 --> 30:08.181
the same courtesy.

30:08.223 --> 30:10.058
You're right.

30:08.223 --> 30:10.058
I don't like to pry.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.351
But I want you to

30:10.100 --> 30:11.351
feel comfortable sharing

30:11.393 --> 30:12.852
anything with me.

30:14.730 --> 30:19.610
When I was 12 years old,

30:14.730 --> 30:19.610
my dad found Jesus.

30:19.652 --> 30:22.696
He left a lucrative career

30:19.652 --> 30:22.696
in advertising for the pulpit.

30:22.738 --> 30:25.157
He said he couldn't stand

30:22.738 --> 30:25.157
another day of writing jingles

30:25.198 --> 30:28.285
that people could whistle

30:25.198 --> 30:28.285
on their way to hell.

30:28.327 --> 30:32.872
He wanted to climb

30:28.327 --> 30:32.872
Jacob's Ladder instead.

30:32.914 --> 30:35.875
He threw our whole family

30:32.914 --> 30:35.875
into debt. We lost our house.

30:35.917 --> 30:39.463
I worked my way through college,

30:35.917 --> 30:39.463
and I still have loans.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.548
I appreciate your sharing

30:39.505 --> 30:41.548
that with me.

30:41.590 --> 30:43.967
But it leaves me wondering

30:41.590 --> 30:43.967
what we've been doing

30:44.009 --> 30:45.552
this whole time together, then,

30:45.594 --> 30:47.095
if you never felt secure

30:45.594 --> 30:47.095
or provided for.

30:47.137 --> 30:49.556
So maybe I have some

30:47.137 --> 30:49.556
trust issues too,

30:49.598 --> 30:52.058
but that's not all of it.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.812
I don't want to be

30:52.100 --> 30:54.812
dependent on you.

30:54.853 --> 30:58.231
I can't count on you

30:54.853 --> 30:58.231
providing for me forever.

30:58.273 --> 31:00.400
That's not fair

30:58.273 --> 31:00.400
to either one of us.

31:00.442 --> 31:03.945
I need to be able

31:00.442 --> 31:03.945
to provide for myself.

31:03.987 --> 31:07.783
God never made any sense to me.

31:03.987 --> 31:07.783
Neither did heaven or hell.

31:07.825 --> 31:09.284
But the markets do.

31:09.326 --> 31:10.910
You are punished or

31:09.326 --> 31:10.910
rewarded as you deserve.

31:10.952 --> 31:12.705
It's not up to anyone's whim.

31:12.746 --> 31:15.582
That's the kind of stability

31:12.746 --> 31:15.582
I can devote my life to.

31:27.511 --> 31:30.430
Let's get into the far reaches

31:27.511 --> 31:30.430
of liberty and the law.

31:30.472 --> 31:32.683
Marijuana, specifically.

31:32.725 --> 31:34.976
Legalization as

31:32.725 --> 31:34.976
a form of liberty

31:35.018 --> 31:36.436
and a source of tax revenue?

31:36.478 --> 31:39.356
Or is it a furtherance

31:36.478 --> 31:39.356
of moral decay

31:39.398 --> 31:42.150
that needs to be curtailed

31:39.398 --> 31:42.150
in order to preserve

31:42.192 --> 31:44.027
liberty of thought?

31:44.069 --> 31:46.112
Let me kick this off,

31:44.069 --> 31:46.112
'cause I have something to say.

31:46.154 --> 31:49.991
-Legalization, I'm for it, and--

31:46.154 --> 31:49.991
-[Swerdlow] I don't know, man.

31:50.033 --> 31:51.618
about moral decay...

31:51.660 --> 31:53.328
-Excuse me--

31:51.660 --> 31:53.328
-But you don't know true freedom

32:00.669 --> 32:03.129
Of course you don't.

<i>but not deaf to our age.</i>

35:42.557 --> 35:44.434
<i>SCOTUS isn't the Vatican.</i>

35:44.476 --> 35:46.394
Exactly the theme

35:44.476 --> 35:46.394
of our discussion.

35:46.436 --> 35:49.982
What are the chances the

35:46.436 --> 35:49.982
case goes before the court?

35:50.023 --> 35:52.150
<i>Well, I'm not a betting man,</i>

35:50.023 --> 35:52.150
<i>but hell,</i>

35:52.191 --> 35:55.403
<i>if I were, even Ladbroke's</i>

35:52.191 --> 35:55.403
<i>doesn't take action on this,</i>

35:55.445 --> 35:58.657
<i>but I wouldn't bet against it.</i>

36:09.626 --> 36:10.710
Let's eat!

36:10.752 --> 36:12.420
Oh, I already finished.

36:12.462 --> 36:13.964
He served the main course,

36:14.006 --> 36:15.381
and I didn't want mine

36:14.006 --> 36:15.381
to get cold.

36:15.423 --> 36:17.968
Sorry. But I mean,

36:15.423 --> 36:17.968
cold chicken?

36:18.010 --> 36:19.385
Bleh.

36:19.427 --> 36:22.597
Of course. You're right.

36:19.427 --> 36:22.597
Blech.

36:22.639 --> 36:25.684
Well, I hope you don't

36:22.639 --> 36:25.684
mind watching me eat.

36:25.725 --> 36:27.060
Can I get you some more wine?

36:29.104 --> 36:31.356
[Tuk] I just have

36:29.104 --> 36:31.356
a quick question.

36:31.397 --> 36:33.942
This form asks for

36:31.397 --> 36:33.942
my department head.

36:33.984 --> 36:35.485
Would that be you?

36:35.527 --> 36:38.155
And actually,

36:35.527 --> 36:38.155
what's my department?

36:38.196 --> 36:40.406
Wait, what's my new title?

36:40.448 --> 36:42.117
Can I pick it myself?

36:43.785 --> 36:46.663
Does my office look

36:43.785 --> 36:46.663
any different, Tuk?

36:47.789 --> 36:50.458
The tablecloth, the candlelight?

36:50.500 --> 36:55.088
Maybe the beautiful, young

36:50.500 --> 36:55.088
inamorata sitting right here?

36:55.130 --> 36:57.549
Do<i> any</i> of these

36:55.130 --> 36:57.549
signs tell you

36:57.590 --> 37:01.970
that now is not

36:57.590 --> 37:01.970
a good time?

37:02.012 --> 37:04.931
Let's review some basics.

37:04.973 --> 37:09.519
I am the goddamn

37:04.973 --> 37:09.519
CEO of Axe Bank.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.354
I am neither your

37:09.561 --> 37:11.354
department head

37:11.396 --> 37:15.108
nor the person you come to

37:11.396 --> 37:15.108
with your imbecilic questions.

37:15.150 --> 37:19.696
I have much, much bigger fish

37:15.150 --> 37:19.696
on my metaphorical plate,

37:19.738 --> 37:22.199
and a fucking cold<i> coq au vin</i>

37:19.738 --> 37:22.199
on my actual plate.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.118
And nobody likes cold<i> coq,</i>

37:22.240 --> 37:25.118
you know what I'm sayin'?

37:28.788 --> 37:31.166
He needs to be made

37:28.788 --> 37:31.166
a fucking example of.

37:31.208 --> 37:32.834
Don't you run from me,

37:32.876 --> 37:34.961
you loathsome

37:32.876 --> 37:34.961
little prick squirt!

37:35.921 --> 37:37.172
Fucking cunt!

37:39.966 --> 37:42.802
Mike Prince and my son

37:39.966 --> 37:42.802
are squarely at odds

37:42.844 --> 37:44.303
over this ganja business.

37:44.345 --> 37:45.764
[Prince] I've heard it

37:44.345 --> 37:45.764
from you...

37:45.805 --> 37:47.390
...John Birch Society

37:45.805 --> 37:47.390

37:47.432 --> 37:48.767
-What? You've got to be kidding!

37:47.432 --> 37:48.767
-...on cannabis.

37:48.808 --> 37:50.309
It needs to be legalized

37:48.808 --> 37:50.309
and federally.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.020
-Yeah. Right on, hophead.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.020
-[Prince] Oh, well,

37:52.062 --> 37:53.396
-that's great.

37:52.062 --> 37:53.396
-[Senior]<i> It got heated as hell.</i>

37:53.438 --> 37:55.607
Barbs and brickbats

37:53.438 --> 37:55.607
tossed around.

37:55.648 --> 37:58.193
<i>The long and the short it is:</i>

37:58.235 --> 38:00.820
<i>Prince kind of</i>

37:58.235 --> 38:00.820

38:02.822 --> 38:04.449
can be taxed.

38:04.490 --> 38:05.825

38:07.535 --> 38:09.204

38:09.246 --> 38:12.874

<i>Both of them seemed to think</i>

38:17.045 --> 38:19.005
<i>that was a victory</i>

38:17.045 --> 38:19.005
<i>for their side.</i>

38:19.047 --> 38:21.507
<i>But I wouldn't invest</i>

38:19.047 --> 38:21.507
<i>in cannabis right now.</i>

38:21.549 --> 38:22.968
<i>Too much uncertainty.</i>

38:24.803 --> 38:25.845
Hold on.

38:27.555 --> 38:29.474
That was no fight.

38:29.515 --> 38:32.144
That's what they

38:29.515 --> 38:32.144
wanted us to think.

38:34.479 --> 38:38.066
They're in this together.

38:34.479 --> 38:38.066
My two enemies have linked up.

38:38.108 --> 38:40.359
<i>They're trying to make</i>

38:38.108 --> 38:40.359

38:41.945 --> 38:43.780

39:11.599 --> 39:14.853
all the way green.

39:14.894 --> 39:17.230

39:17.272 --> 39:20.483

Someone's about to get smoked.

39:31.703 --> 39:32.912
You got that right.

39:32.954 --> 39:34.206
Whatever he's going after,

39:34.247 --> 39:35.707
I'm gonna take it.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.088
You're leaving.

39:42.130 --> 39:44.090
Yeah, to let you

39:42.130 --> 39:44.090
do your thing.

39:44.132 --> 39:46.051
This night turned into a mess.

39:44.132 --> 39:46.051
I'm sorry.

39:46.092 --> 39:48.636
I was hoping I could show you

39:46.092 --> 39:48.636
that I could be both a bank CEO

39:48.678 --> 39:51.681
and a substantial suitor,

39:51.723 --> 39:54.433
the kind you'd think

39:51.723 --> 39:54.433
long-term about.

39:54.475 --> 39:57.312
The kind you'd be proud

39:54.475 --> 39:57.312
to introduce to your folks.

39:57.354 --> 40:00.106
Instead, I showed

39:57.354 --> 40:00.106
a side of myself that was--

40:00.148 --> 40:03.068
That was totally baller.

40:03.109 --> 40:06.779
I loved watching you

40:03.109 --> 40:06.779
ream that beta.

40:06.821 --> 40:09.824
I was beginning to worry

40:06.821 --> 40:09.824
that you were past it.

40:09.866 --> 40:12.451
But you're no lap dog.

40:14.287 --> 40:15.580
You're a Rottweiler.

40:15.621 --> 40:18.666
[elevator bell dings]

40:18.708 --> 40:20.377
Finish up here and

40:18.708 --> 40:20.377
have the front desk

40:20.418 --> 40:22.170
let me up to your place.

40:23.380 --> 40:25.048
I'll be waiting for you.

40:36.976 --> 40:38.728
Huh.

40:44.150 --> 40:45.902
[incoming call ringing]

40:47.570 --> 40:49.406
<i>Hi.</i>

40:49.447 --> 40:53.285
Wend, look, I only half

40:49.447 --> 40:53.285
said it before

40:53.326 --> 40:54.994
we got interrupted, about uh,

40:55.036 --> 40:57.038
why I hated you and Tanner--

40:57.080 --> 40:59.082
Let me do this first.

40:59.124 --> 41:02.168
Because until it's done, uh,

40:59.124 --> 41:02.168
I can't hear anything else.

41:02.210 --> 41:03.461
Until what's done?

41:03.502 --> 41:04.879
<i>Chuck.</i>

41:04.921 --> 41:07.173
I need his hand

41:04.921 --> 41:07.173
out of my pocket

41:07.215 --> 41:09.759
and his nose out of--

41:07.215 --> 41:09.759
our business.

<i>I can give you</i>

41:09.801 --> 41:11.594

41:11.636 --> 41:13.638
<i>or cut to the punch line,</i>

41:11.636 --> 41:13.638
<i>which is:</i>

41:13.679 --> 41:15.974
I need you to buy out

41:13.679 --> 41:15.974
my shares of Mase Carbon

41:16.015 --> 41:17.600
today in cash.

41:17.642 --> 41:19.311
And promise to let me

41:17.642 --> 41:19.311
buy 'em back at par

41:19.352 --> 41:20.853
<i>whenever I can.</i>

41:20.895 --> 41:22.314
How much?

41:22.355 --> 41:24.357
It's $25 million.

41:27.526 --> 41:29.195
[chuckles]

41:33.032 --> 41:34.659
Done.

41:54.053 --> 41:55.554
I sold to Axe.

41:58.266 --> 42:00.726
You agreed not to do

41:58.266 --> 42:00.726
that mere hours ago.

42:00.768 --> 42:02.520
Did our discussion mean

42:00.768 --> 42:02.520
that little to you?

42:02.561 --> 42:04.356
I know. But then I realized:

42:04.397 --> 42:05.690
We can trust him.

42:05.731 --> 42:07.692
You can.

42:07.733 --> 42:09.486
You must know

42:07.733 --> 42:09.486
that sounds ridiculous.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.196
How can I suddenly

42:09.527 --> 42:11.196
trust him?

42:11.237 --> 42:13.698
Because he wouldn't do

42:11.237 --> 42:13.698
anything to hurt me.

42:13.739 --> 42:17.827
And I know I'm the only person

42:13.739 --> 42:17.827
in the world that's true of.

42:17.869 --> 42:20.413
He's hurt you before

42:17.869 --> 42:20.413
when he's needed to.

42:20.455 --> 42:21.747
He did.

42:21.789 --> 42:23.166
But I understand why.

42:28.380 --> 42:30.965
And things are different

42:28.380 --> 42:30.965
between us now.

42:38.348 --> 42:39.891
I see.

42:42.143 --> 42:43.644
In that case, I'll affirm it.

42:46.605 --> 42:48.983
Good.

42:49.025 --> 42:50.776
I'm glad to hear you say that.

43:15.468 --> 43:17.303
Have you made

43:15.468 --> 43:17.303
your decision yet?

43:17.345 --> 43:19.514
Still torn.

43:19.556 --> 43:22.392
I have been thinking

43:19.556 --> 43:22.392
about what you said.

43:24.143 --> 43:26.645
But I believe I can do both,

43:26.687 --> 43:28.981
handle the bank and Mase Carb.

43:29.023 --> 43:30.983
I'd like to pitch it to Axe.

43:32.693 --> 43:35.113
Well, then, technically,

43:32.693 --> 43:35.113
you still work for me.

43:35.154 --> 43:37.282
So I have the power

43:35.154 --> 43:37.282
to do this:

43:37.323 --> 43:38.408
You're fired.

43:42.703 --> 43:44.414
I'll go to Axe, then.

43:44.456 --> 43:46.332
I'll get him to back me up

43:44.456 --> 43:46.332
and you know he will.

43:46.374 --> 43:48.376
IR girls are growing on trees

43:46.374 --> 43:48.376
out there these days.

43:48.418 --> 43:52.630
How can you be so spiteful?

43:52.671 --> 43:54.048
Where is this coming from?

43:54.090 --> 43:55.758
You told me about

43:54.090 --> 43:55.758
your trust issues.

43:55.800 --> 43:57.635
Now I'll tell you about mine.

43:57.676 --> 43:59.471
Every time I trust someone

43:57.676 --> 43:59.471
close to me to make a decision,

43:59.512 --> 44:01.013
they choose to fuck me over.

44:01.055 --> 44:03.099
I thought you were different.

44:01.055 --> 44:03.099
I was wrong.

44:03.141 --> 44:04.350
It's that simple to you?

44:04.392 --> 44:05.851
Yes, it is. You made it so.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.063
I'm not torn anymore.

44:09.105 --> 44:10.523
Not at all.

44:11.774 --> 44:13.192
If that's how you feel about me

44:13.234 --> 44:15.320
after everything

44:13.234 --> 44:15.320
we've built together,

44:15.361 --> 44:17.155
then it's all clear.

44:17.196 --> 44:18.239
[sighs]

44:18.281 --> 44:19.698
Maybe for the first time.

44:19.740 --> 44:22.034
Well, I'm glad I

44:19.740 --> 44:22.034
could elucidate for you.

44:22.076 --> 44:25.663
You talk a big game about

44:22.076 --> 44:25.663
worshipping logic,

44:25.704 --> 44:28.416
clean, emotionless simplicity.

44:28.458 --> 44:32.378
But every move you make

44:28.458 --> 44:32.378
comes from a personal pain

44:32.420 --> 44:35.047
so deep you can't

44:32.420 --> 44:35.047
even recognize it.

44:37.758 --> 44:40.719
Stay out of the apartment

44:37.758 --> 44:40.719
until I clear my shit out.

44:53.483 --> 44:55.360
We did it.

44:55.401 --> 44:58.196
All these people are going

44:55.401 --> 44:58.196
to push our agenda forward.

44:58.237 --> 44:59.656
They texted me.

44:59.696 --> 45:03.117
I know it is so because

44:59.696 --> 45:03.117
I can almost feel

45:03.159 --> 45:06.078
that bit of melancholy

45:03.159 --> 45:06.078
that comes on the precipice

45:06.120 --> 45:08.498
of momentous success.

45:08.540 --> 45:11.167
Comes on the precipice

45:08.540 --> 45:11.167
of failure, too.

45:11.792 --> 45:13.752
True.

45:18.216 --> 45:20.009
That argument was a nice touch.

45:20.051 --> 45:22.387
Convincing.

45:20.051 --> 45:22.387
Almost felt personal.

45:22.428 --> 45:23.471
To sell it.

45:23.513 --> 45:25.264
Ah. Ah-ah.

45:28.393 --> 45:30.603
Oh, morning, sweetheart.

45:30.645 --> 45:32.271
You're up early.

45:32.313 --> 45:34.148
Hi, Dad. Couldn't sleep.

45:34.190 --> 45:36.568
Oh. Hey, uh,

45:34.190 --> 45:36.568
this is Mr. Prince.

45:36.609 --> 45:38.236
Call me Mike.

45:38.277 --> 45:39.445
Hello.

45:39.487 --> 45:41.447
What's that smell?

45:41.489 --> 45:44.741
Remnants of your

45:41.489 --> 45:44.741
grandfather's cigar.

45:44.783 --> 45:46.994
-You hungry?

45:44.783 --> 45:46.994
-Mm-hm.

45:47.036 --> 45:48.705
Good.

48:14.016 --> 48:18.437
[laughing]

48:38.999 --> 48:40.251
That's yours.

[Wendy]<i> Hey.</i>

49:30.008 --> 49:31.594
Hey.

49:36.181 --> 49:38.559
You were right earlier.

49:40.227 --> 49:42.939
It's, um, it's true.

49:42.979 --> 49:45.900
I was trying to ruin

49:42.979 --> 49:45.900
Tanner in your eyes.

49:52.114 --> 49:55.618
But not as a favor to you,

49:55.660 --> 49:58.788
or to try to show you

49:55.660 --> 49:58.788
something about him,

50:03.167 --> 50:04.669
but because of you.

50:07.630 --> 50:10.132
<i>Because I couldn't stand</i>

50:07.630 --> 50:10.132
<i>you being with him.</i>

50:16.138 --> 50:17.723
Or anyone.

50:20.893 --> 50:22.645
I can't stand it.

50:27.358 --> 50:29.318
You don't want me

50:27.358 --> 50:29.318
to be all alone though.

50:32.112 --> 50:34.156
You can't want that.

50:37.660 --> 50:39.411
No.

50:40.371 --> 50:42.289
I do not.

50:44.876 --> 50:47.211
That's what I'm

50:44.876 --> 50:47.211
experiencing right now,

50:47.252 --> 50:49.129
and it's making me realize it.

50:57.889 --> 50:59.431
I know.

51:03.352 --> 51:06.939
I look at it... honestly,

51:06.981 --> 51:08.941
but I've never allowed

51:06.981 --> 51:08.941
myself to really think,

51:08.983 --> 51:12.110
I feel the same things

51:08.983 --> 51:12.110
when I look at you.
