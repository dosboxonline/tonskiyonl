12:47.851 --> 12:50.604
Or that I had to suck cock

12:50.604 --> 12:54.357
like a fucking popsicle
to stay in The Seven. No.

12:54.357 --> 12:55.567
No, no, no, no, no.

12:55.567 --> 12:58.862
I'm Annie January and it's not my fault."

12:58.862 --> 13:00.030
Come on, say it with me now.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.948
I'm Annie January and it's not my...

13:01.948 --> 13:03.742
Fuck you!

13:03.742 --> 13:07.621
You don't know anything
about me or my life.

13:07.621 --> 13:10.207
No? Then why aren't your powers working?

13:10.207 --> 13:11.541
[ominous music playing]

13:11.541 --> 13:13.543
[grunting]

13:14.628 --> 13:15.670
I mean,

13:15.670 --> 13:18.089
you weren't even
the original choice to kill Singer,

13:18.089 --> 13:21.885
but you're just such a fucking hot mess,

13:21.885 --> 13:24.179
you made it undeniable.

13:25.639 --> 13:26.973
Hey.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.518
You'll have a couple of...

13:29.518 --> 13:31.561
non-consecutive life sentences

13:31.561 --> 13:32.896
to work through your identity issues.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.856
- Please...
- Aw.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.608
Poor Annie.

13:38.318 --> 13:42.447
- Please.
-"Oh, God, I'm Annie January

13:42.447 --> 13:44.199
and I'm the only good one."

13:44.199 --> 13:45.784
[mock cries, laughs]

13:45.784 --> 13:47.786
[claps]

13:47.786 --> 13:50.413
Oh. Here.

13:50.413 --> 13:54.209
To wash down those Lean Lad Lunches.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.925
Okay.

14:01.925 --> 14:03.385
Ah.

14:04.469 --> 14:05.637
[door opens]

14:13.812 --> 14:15.564
- Oi oi.
- [Hughie] <i>I've called you, like,</i>

14:15.564 --> 14:17.524
15 times. I was worried. I thought...

14:17.524 --> 14:19.276
I don't know, I thought maybe you were...

14:19.276 --> 14:21.653
Yeah, you and me both.

14:21.653 --> 14:23.154
<i>Look, we're kind of up against it
right now.</i>

14:23.154 --> 14:25.407
<i>They're only a few hours away
from certifying the election</i>

14:25.407 --> 14:29.077
<i>and then, you know, after that happens
they're-they're coming for Singer.</i>

14:29.077 --> 14:30.704
<i>We need your help.</i>

14:32.872 --> 14:34.583
<i>Butcher?</i>

14:34.583 --> 14:37.335
When I was a lad,

14:37.335 --> 14:40.213
I heard about this place in Nevada.

14:41.339 --> 14:42.882
A steakhouse.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.137
Where the birds get their baps out
when they're bringing your ribeye.

14:48.597 --> 14:50.557
<i>- Cool.</i>
- [soft chuckle]

14:50.557 --> 14:53.435
Lenny nearly pissed himself
when I told him.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.188
Thought it was
the funniest thing he ever heard.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.445
We was gonna go there someday.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.035
Well...

15:11.536 --> 15:14.289
Funny what you think about
when your time's up, innit?

15:14.289 --> 15:17.959
<i>Butcher, where are you?
I-I can come to you.</i>

15:17.959 --> 15:20.086
<i>You know, we can figure this out.</i>

15:20.086 --> 15:22.213
Do us a favor, would you, Hughie?

15:27.052 --> 15:28.762
Go there.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.557
For me and Len, would you?

15:32.557 --> 15:34.851
<i>You can't fucking give up.</i>

15:34.851 --> 15:36.936
<i>You can still fight.</i>

15:36.936 --> 15:39.064
Hughie, I asked you something.

15:40.857 --> 15:43.193
<i>Fine. I'll-I'll, um...</i>

15:43.193 --> 15:45.362
<i>I'll go to the topless steakhouse for you.</i>

15:46.655 --> 15:48.156
Magic.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.410
And, uh...

15:55.997 --> 15:58.375
...tell the Boys I'm sorry, would you?

16:01.002 --> 16:03.755
Tell the Boys I'm sorry

16:03.755 --> 16:05.215
for, uh...

16:09.302 --> 16:11.638
Just tell them I'm sorry.

16:15.225 --> 16:16.851
Goodbye, Hughie.

16:17.852 --> 16:19.854
[somber music playing]

16:28.196 --> 16:30.407
Oh, hey, um,

16:30.407 --> 16:33.952
have Negin get me a caramel pretzel
s'more frappe from Jitter Bean.

16:33.952 --> 16:36.871
Double whip.
I'm just like molasses in winter today.

16:36.871 --> 16:40.333
Ugh, God, that's enough, Amber. Thank you.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.464
Good morning. [chuckles]

16:46.464 --> 16:48.091
How are you doing this mor... [coughs]

16:48.091 --> 16:49.592
Oh, God.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.511
[coughing] Excuse me. [chuckles]

16:51.511 --> 16:52.679
Can we just make this quick, please?

16:52.679 --> 16:54.055
I have slightly more important things
to do today.

16:54.055 --> 16:56.725
- [Also Ashley] Yes ma'am, of course.
- [clears throat] Hey.

16:56.725 --> 16:59.936
[stage manager] Stand by.
Going in five, four,

16:59.936 --> 17:01.604
three...

17:03.481 --> 17:05.275
- [rock music playing]
- Welcome to the show, folks.

17:05.275 --> 17:07.777
We got a real happy surprise
for y'all today.

17:07.777 --> 17:11.114
Homelander and vice president-elect

17:11.114 --> 17:13.199
Victoria Neuman.

17:13.199 --> 17:16.202
[gasps] Bless both your hearts
for being here.

17:16.202 --> 17:19.289
I'm more than happy to find time
for my friend Homelander.

17:19.289 --> 17:20.915
Yeah, let's cut the BS.

17:20.915 --> 17:24.085
Dakota Bob says he's gonna pass
nutbag anti-Supe laws

17:24.085 --> 17:25.628
in his first hundred days.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.130
- [muffled] As his VP...
- [high-pitched ringing]

17:27.130 --> 17:29.215
[muffled voices continue indistinctly]

17:33.470 --> 17:36.264
- [ringing stops]
- [Neuman] ...staunch ally
of the super-abled community,

17:36.264 --> 17:38.016
- I really think that it's important to--
- [laughs]

17:38.016 --> 17:40.185
Ally, Victoria, really?

17:42.479 --> 17:44.731
We're here to tell the truth.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.901
So just... tell the truth.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.406
The truth is that

17:53.406 --> 17:55.283
the real issue here
is lack of representation.

17:55.283 --> 17:57.160
- And I want to make sure that you--
- Fine, you don't want to do it?

17:57.160 --> 17:58.244
I'll do it.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.662
Uh...

17:59.662 --> 18:02.957
Victoria here is a superhero.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.753
[laughs] Thanks for the compliment.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.839
But, like, I think the truth
is we all want to be heroes,

18:09.839 --> 18:12.509
but, um, I'm not literally a su--

18:12.509 --> 18:14.093
- [dramatic music playing]
- [gasps]

18:14.093 --> 18:16.387
Oh, fuck.

18:17.472 --> 18:18.598
[Firecracker] It's all true.

18:18.598 --> 18:22.685
<i>Ms. Neuman here has been operating as</i>

18:22.685 --> 18:25.104
a secret dagger
in the heart of the deep state,

18:25.104 --> 18:27.357
standing up to the forces of darkness
that want to

18:27.357 --> 18:30.193
<i>sodomize our democracy and our toddlers,</i>

18:30.193 --> 18:33.071
<i>but it is time for the great awakening.</i>

18:33.071 --> 18:36.032
Where we go one, we go Vought, y'all.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.116
<i>We're gonna take a quick break...</i>

18:37.116 --> 18:39.202
Cunt's out of the bag, innit?

18:40.411 --> 18:41.871
Now it gets interesting.

18:41.871 --> 18:44.374
All right. Great show, guys.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.795
Hey. Hey!

18:52.423 --> 18:54.384
- Ma'am...
- Fuck off! Hey.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.427
I worked my whole life
to keep that secret.

18:56.427 --> 18:58.721
Well, secrets rot your soul.

18:58.721 --> 19:01.099
- You're unburdened. You should thank me.
- Sage said--

19:01.099 --> 19:03.810
Fuck Sage. She's long gone. Listen to me.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.186
Listen to me.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.814
We are gonna change the world,

19:07.814 --> 19:10.692
Vicky, for our kids and their kids.

19:10.692 --> 19:14.279
The first super-abled president.

19:14.279 --> 19:17.073
Hmm? And you're a gal.

19:17.073 --> 19:19.325
I'll be impeached.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.910
- Why would we care?
- Because I have to

19:20.910 --> 19:23.246
- get re-elected in four years.
- Says who?

19:23.246 --> 19:24.539
Article II of the Constitution.

19:24.539 --> 19:25.957
New world, new rules.

19:25.957 --> 19:28.001
Now shut the fuck up and listen.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.003
Our fates are connected now.

19:30.003 --> 19:33.339
Singer's as good as dead, and I am
the only fucking friend you've got left.

19:33.339 --> 19:37.010
The train has left the station,
gorgeous, and you're on it.

19:38.094 --> 19:41.472
You'll have to arrest half your company.
Half the country.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.604
Wait, you think I didn't think of that?
Of course I thought of that.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.690
[Neuman] Fuck.

19:50.690 --> 19:54.694
- Ashley, on me now.
- Um, the response on socials
has been mixed.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.196
I need you to make a list
of anyone within the company

19:57.196 --> 20:00.742
that has damaging information on me
or The Seven--

20:00.742 --> 20:02.201
but mostly me--

20:02.201 --> 20:03.870
anyone with any fucking
leverage whatsoever.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.039
- Yes.
- I need this fucking list yesterday.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.123
Yes, sir.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.499
You're a good girl.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.585
[tense music playing]

20:10.585 --> 20:11.794
Um...

20:11.794 --> 20:15.006
- that doesn't sound good, Ashley.
- Oh, yeah, no shit, Ashley.

20:15.006 --> 20:16.257
Sorry, Ashley.

20:16.257 --> 20:17.884
[Calhoun] Order!

20:17.884 --> 20:21.554
The purpose of the joint session
having concluded,

20:21.554 --> 20:25.767
pursuant to Senate Concurrent
Resolution 1, 118th congress,

20:25.767 --> 20:29.062
the chair declares
the joint session resolved.

20:29.062 --> 20:32.315
...certified the election
despite the shocking news

20:32.315 --> 20:36.444
that vice president-elect
Victoria Neuman is super-abled.

20:36.444 --> 20:38.863
<i>Protests have erupted all over the country</i>

20:38.863 --> 20:40.573
<i>-as Starlighters...</i>
- That's the ballgame.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.159
Open season on Singer now.
Frenchie, tell me you got something.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.620
[speaks French]
You want to try this instead of me?

20:45.620 --> 20:47.747
I'm working as fast as I can.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.540
Not fast enough.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.501
<i>Multiple protestors have been injured...</i>

20:51.501 --> 20:53.753
- [phone rings]
- You seeing this?

20:53.753 --> 20:55.672
Get all the dirt on Neuman ready
in case we need to go nuclear.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.173
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What happened to the virus?

20:57.173 --> 20:58.925
There is no fucking virus.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.135
What? Fuck.

21:01.135 --> 21:04.097
Okay, well, you know she's gonna
kill us if we leak this, right?

21:04.097 --> 21:05.848
If I had another fucking choice,
trust me, I'd take it.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.225
<i>All right, here goes fucking nothing.</i>

21:07.225 --> 21:09.352
[singsongy] Hi.

21:10.144 --> 21:13.106
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no. Fuck!

21:13.106 --> 21:14.732
- What? What happened?
- It's all gone.

21:14.732 --> 21:16.317
Everything we have on Neuman--
the murders,

21:16.317 --> 21:18.444
<i>- her ties to Stan Edgar, everything.</i>
- Okay, okay, wait a second.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.863
You got backups, right-- another computer
or the motherfucking cloud?

21:20.863 --> 21:23.032
You're not hearing me. It's all gone.
The originals,

21:23.032 --> 21:24.492
the backups, we've got nothing.

21:25.576 --> 21:27.954
Ain't nothing stopping her then.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.706
Only one thing left to do.

21:29.706 --> 21:33.501
Frenchie, you stay here,
work fucking faster.

21:33.501 --> 21:34.961
Kimiko, you're with me.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.921
Listen, Hughie, I'm sending you
coordinates. You and Annie,

21:36.921 --> 21:38.673
<i>- meet there ASAP.</i>
- What's the plan?

21:38.673 --> 21:42.510
We fucked up our chance at offense.
All we got now is defense.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.846
[dramatic music playing]

21:44.846 --> 21:46.764
I am as shocked as you are

21:46.764 --> 21:49.726
by this profound betrayal of trust.

21:49.726 --> 21:52.645
In America, you tell people who you are

21:52.645 --> 21:54.981
before you ask for their vote.

21:54.981 --> 21:58.735
<i>That's why I'm calling
for a new, free and fair election.</i>

21:58.735 --> 22:00.862
<i>Mark my words,</i>

22:00.862 --> 22:03.239
<i>if Victoria Neuman becomes vice president,</i>

22:03.239 --> 22:05.950
<i>it will be over my dead body</i>

22:05.950 --> 22:07.910
<i>because she had me assassinated.</i>

22:07.910 --> 22:08.995
[TV clicks off]

22:08.995 --> 22:12.290
Wow. Guess you got to go
take a bullet for the geezer, don't you?

22:12.290 --> 22:14.333
I think it's more important
that I stay here.

22:15.460 --> 22:16.586
Your visitor's here.

22:16.586 --> 22:18.796
- Send him in.
- [door closes]

22:24.886 --> 22:25.887
[sighs]

22:29.265 --> 22:30.725
Man, this is never gonna work.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.644
[Butcher] You got my text.

22:33.644 --> 22:35.354
I'm glad you came.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.691
[chuckles]
You're almost taller than me now.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.360
There's no saving the kid.
He can't escape his own blood.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.612
[Mallory] What are they feeding you?

22:42.612 --> 22:44.572
And tell me there's vegetables
involved somewhere.

22:44.572 --> 22:46.324
[Ryan] There's lettuce on the burgers.

22:46.324 --> 22:48.117
[̈laughs] I've missed you, kiddo.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.622
Listen, Ryan,

22:52.622 --> 22:55.500
we, uh, need to have
a bit of a serious chin wag.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.127
You look... really sick.

22:58.127 --> 22:59.670
Don't I know it.

23:01.464 --> 23:04.133
Mate, I've wished myself dead more times

23:04.133 --> 23:05.760
than I can count.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.890
And now here I am,

23:10.890 --> 23:12.225
and I want some more time.

23:12.225 --> 23:14.685
But I don't have it,

23:14.685 --> 23:16.646
and I don't have time
to ease you into this.

23:16.646 --> 23:18.439
You're gonna have to kill him, Billy.

23:18.439 --> 23:20.525
You can't go back to the tower.

23:20.525 --> 23:23.111
- You need to go with Aunt Grace.
- [Ryan] What?

23:23.111 --> 23:25.071
- Like when?
- [Butcher] Now.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.240
- Right now.
- [Ryan] No, I-I can't.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.742
- My dad would find me.
- Not this time, kiddo.

23:31.619 --> 23:33.287
Well...

23:33.287 --> 23:34.914
I'm not sure I want to leave.

23:34.914 --> 23:38.167
I kind of like it there.
Well, parts of it.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.711
You see? You got to stab him with
the virus and you got to do it today.

23:40.711 --> 23:43.047
[Mallory] Ryan, no.

23:43.047 --> 23:45.299
- Your Dad is a--
- [Butcher] Grace.

23:47.135 --> 23:48.928
Look...

23:48.928 --> 23:52.265
when your mom died--
which weren't your fault...

23:53.432 --> 23:55.268
...you heard what she said.

23:55.268 --> 23:58.646
She had me promise to keep you safe,
and that's all I'm trying to do here.

23:58.646 --> 24:01.274
Now, if you're telling me,

24:01.274 --> 24:03.359
I mean, seriously telling me,

24:03.359 --> 24:06.237
that the place you feel safest

24:06.237 --> 24:07.822
is with Homelander...

24:11.159 --> 24:13.703
...then I ain't gonna stop you.

[somber music playing]

24:26.549 --> 24:28.134
Do you want to play?

24:31.012 --> 24:34.348
All right, then. Come on.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.487
[Ashley speaking indistinctly]

24:48.487 --> 24:50.615
- [Homelander] Have you seen Ryan?
- [Ashley] No, but I can send a PA

24:50.615 --> 24:54.327
- to go look, if you need.
- No. No. Boys need their space.

24:54.327 --> 24:56.704
- List?
- Oh, yeah. Um... Sorry.

24:56.704 --> 24:57.705
[Homelander] Thank you.

24:57.705 --> 24:59.624
[Ashley] I highlighted
anyone who's contract

24:59.624 --> 25:01.584
we'd have to pay out if they're...

25:02.835 --> 25:04.670
...let go.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.797
Great. Thank you. Good job.

25:06.797 --> 25:08.466
You're excused.

25:11.302 --> 25:13.304
[doors sliding shut]

25:15.056 --> 25:16.849
You know, no problem. I can get it.

25:37.954 --> 25:41.123
What we're gonna tell you
is extremely sensitive.

25:41.123 --> 25:42.875
- Got it?
- O Captain, my Captain.

25:44.377 --> 25:47.088
Robert Singer will be dead

25:47.088 --> 25:48.881
by end of business.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.508
Neuman will be sworn in.

25:50.508 --> 25:52.927
People will panic. There will be rioting,

25:52.927 --> 25:55.554
bloodshed, et cetera, et cetera.

25:55.554 --> 25:59.934
Someone will have to swoop in
and restore order.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.729
We will put out the call
to every Vought hero,

26:03.729 --> 26:06.357
every fucking one,
to surround the Capitol,

26:06.357 --> 26:08.651
the White House, and the Pentagon.

26:08.651 --> 26:11.487
Defending the rightful President Neuman.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.698
Now, what I need you two--

26:13.698 --> 26:15.366
[coughing]

26:15.366 --> 26:17.368
Fuck's sakes, get a Ricola.

26:17.368 --> 26:22.039
Sorry, sir. I'm-I'm so sorry.
I'm just... the meds, you know.

26:22.039 --> 26:24.625
You know, the... the meds.

26:27.003 --> 26:28.337
They're just, they're causing a little

26:28.337 --> 26:31.549
heart palpitation and a high fever,
but it ain't no big thing.

26:31.549 --> 26:33.301
Okay, well, you're coughing all over me,
and it's fucking disgusting.

26:33.301 --> 26:34.385
Go further down.

26:35.928 --> 26:36.929
Scoot.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.999
[Homelander] As I was saying...

27:06.417 --> 27:08.169
...everyone on this list

27:08.169 --> 27:11.505
needs to be removed.

27:12.381 --> 27:14.258
Permanently, by the end of the day.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.929
Hey, if we're thinking about
who's got the most dirt on us,

27:18.929 --> 27:21.515
wouldn't Ashley's name be
at the top of the list?

27:23.267 --> 27:25.353
Yeah. Sure. Good idea.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.234
Does anybody know Ashley's last name?

[Secret Service agent] You seriously
telling us

28:42.012 --> 28:43.347
the Shifter can get through that?

28:43.347 --> 28:45.683
Look, for all I fucking know,
they could be in here already.

28:45.683 --> 28:49.061
So, from now on,
everybody moves with a partner,

28:49.061 --> 28:51.730
and you check in
every five minutes on the dot.

28:51.730 --> 28:54.108
Stay sharp and follow
motherfucking orders.

28:54.108 --> 28:56.068
Come on, let's get to it.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.736
Sir, you're gonna be all right.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.738
If you'd killed Neuman like I ordered,

28:59.738 --> 29:01.949
we wouldn't be stuck

Kimiko, stay on Singer.

29:16.839 --> 29:19.508
Do you really think
the Shifter is in here?

29:19.508 --> 29:22.678
I hope not, for Christ's sake,
but it could be anyone,

29:22.678 --> 29:24.430
so eyes on everyone.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.056
Okay. You got it.

- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

29:34.690 --> 29:38.486
I'm just... warm.

Y-You should go find some water.

29:52.041 --> 29:55.002
Yeah. Okay. Do you want one?

29:55.002 --> 29:56.795
I would love one.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.756
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

Real quick, just don't look at me,
look right into the room.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.306
- It's Annie.
- What's Annie?

30:49.306 --> 30:51.225
- The Shifter, it's Annie.
- What?

30:51.225 --> 30:52.643
She's the Shifter.
Don't look at me, just look forward.

30:52.643 --> 30:53.769
How do you know?

30:53.769 --> 30:56.313
Just trust me, I don't know how
or when they switched, but that is

30:56.313 --> 30:59.024
- 100% percent not Annie.
- Okay, okay, okay, listen.

30:59.024 --> 31:02.236
The fate of the country relies on us
keeping our shit together, so just chill--

- Hey.
- Hey.

That is a thing...

31:36.061 --> 31:37.730
- that we did.
- [Shifter Annie] For the record,

31:37.730 --> 31:41.567

'Cause peg the patriarchy, right?

Well, there's nothing on the news.

Because he's gonna
hit me back quietly, and I'm fairly

Look, I thought I was
getting engaged to you, all right?

She looked just like you, you know,
right down to that freckle you have

- So you did fuck her.
