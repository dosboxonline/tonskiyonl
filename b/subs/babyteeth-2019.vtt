01:07.494 --> 01:11.264
<i>Smoking is not allowed at this
station, or on the train.</i>

01:11.298 --> 01:13.333
Like everyone's wearing
strapless to the formal now

01:13.366 --> 01:15.200
so...

01:15.235 --> 01:17.803
Yeah, that's good,
'cause it's a bit, like

01:17.836 --> 01:20.172
I don't know,
that would suit you.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.409
<i>I reckon I'm going to say
something to Mrs. Martin.</i>

01:22.442 --> 01:24.344
<i>Seriously, she need to get her
scales right</i>

01:24.377 --> 01:25.378
<i>and everything, like...</i>

01:25.412 --> 01:28.281
<i>No! You can't!</i>

01:44.163 --> 01:45.998
<i>Dickhead!</i>

01:48.268 --> 01:50.069
<i>Milla!</i>

01:50.102 --> 01:52.971
- <i>Doors closing, stand clear.</i>
- Milla!

02:12.024 --> 02:13.827
Damn!

02:15.829 --> 02:17.996
Your hair's like, uh...

02:18.030 --> 02:19.898
What?

02:19.932 --> 02:23.603
Your hair's like bangles
or something.

02:23.636 --> 02:25.904
Bangles?

02:25.938 --> 02:29.309
Like with the light,
it's like bangles, it's...

02:30.677 --> 02:32.245
Damn.

02:36.616 --> 02:38.451
Yours is nice too.

02:38.485 --> 02:40.687
Yeah, but look at this.

02:40.720 --> 02:42.389
Look at that, see.

02:42.422 --> 02:45.458
I cut myself. See?

02:45.492 --> 02:47.827
I had to get on like a weird
angle to get to that bit.

02:47.861 --> 02:50.230
- And then I...
- Can I feel?

02:50.263 --> 02:51.831
Yeah.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.403
- Feels like snakeskin.
- Ooh! Yeah.

02:59.672 --> 03:02.207
Oh, shit, there's blood...

03:03.476 --> 03:04.910
Oh!

03:04.943 --> 03:06.546
- It's so stupid.
- It's okay.

03:06.579 --> 03:08.046
I'm just gonna wait over there.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.015
Shit, it's gone on your...

03:10.048 --> 03:11.518
- Oh no, it's fine. Seriously.
- It's gone on your shirt. Here.

03:11.551 --> 03:13.586
- Happens all the time.
- Just lay down for a minute.

03:13.620 --> 03:15.187
I got you.

03:17.022 --> 03:20.427
<i>Passengers on platform four,
the next train...</i>

03:22.027 --> 03:25.197
You just find
a little bit of sky.

03:31.438 --> 03:34.641
Sorry, could you just
take it off my face.

03:34.674 --> 03:36.476
It smells.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.856
- Is there blood in my hair?
- Nah.

03:54.327 --> 03:56.796
- Oh, there is a lot of blood.
- Get up.

04:00.266 --> 04:03.436
Hey, um,
I hate to ask you this

04:03.470 --> 04:06.539
um, I've just been kicked out
of my house and...

04:06.573 --> 04:08.241
- Evicted?
- Yeah, evicted.

04:08.274 --> 04:09.876
And, uh, I just,
I'm sort of trying

04:09.909 --> 04:10.910
to put some money together
to get a bed

04:10.944 --> 04:11.945
in a shelter for the night...

04:11.977 --> 04:13.580
Why did you get evicted?

04:13.613 --> 04:15.648
Just because I got behind
in my rent. I hate to ask you.

04:15.682 --> 04:16.716
You just seem like a really nice
person.

04:16.749 --> 04:17.884
How much?

04:17.917 --> 04:19.552
Uh, just whatever
you can manage.

04:19.586 --> 04:21.019
It doesn't have to be much.

04:21.053 --> 04:22.555
Just 'cause I saved your life
or whatever.

04:22.589 --> 04:25.325
- I've only got 50.
- Fifty! That's too much!

04:25.358 --> 04:27.059
- I can't...
- I can split it.

04:27.092 --> 04:29.829
Uh, no, no, no.
Fifty's okay.

04:38.571 --> 04:40.874
Hey, you want to take this one?

04:40.907 --> 04:43.910
If I give you 50,
you have to do something for me.

04:49.081 --> 04:52.719
You know she's playing easy
listening in the reception?

04:52.752 --> 04:55.120
No wonder your patients
are so tense.

04:58.156 --> 05:00.627
- <i>Is my time up?</i>
- Not quite.

05:00.660 --> 05:02.362
<i>I'm just boring you.</i>

05:04.129 --> 05:07.065
- It's quarter past.
- Yeah, alright.

05:12.505 --> 05:16.009
- Really?
- When's your next client?

05:18.210 --> 05:19.913
4:30.
It's just she tends to be early.

05:19.946 --> 05:23.215
Oh, let's just do it.
Don't you think?

05:23.249 --> 05:26.519
It's the last thing we're going
to feel like doing next Tuesday.

05:26.553 --> 05:28.388
Hm!

05:28.421 --> 05:29.956
Hm!

05:31.457 --> 05:33.259
While I remember...

05:36.896 --> 05:38.831
Take one of these with food.

05:38.865 --> 05:41.568
These are the same things that
are in the blue bottle, yeah?

05:41.601 --> 05:45.038
And, darling, start taking an
Ativan in the morning as well.

05:45.070 --> 05:47.072
Just for the next few weeks,
alright?

05:47.105 --> 05:49.709
- I love this bra.
- Hm.

05:49.742 --> 05:52.045
Couch or desk? Hm?

06:02.822 --> 06:04.324
Oh.

06:04.357 --> 06:06.292
She looks like a little kid
here.

06:06.326 --> 06:08.027
Do you know
that was five years ago.

06:08.061 --> 06:10.029
I don't remember
this being taken.

06:10.063 --> 06:12.432
She looks so pissed off.

06:12.465 --> 06:14.901
- She does not look pissed off.
- She does.

06:14.934 --> 06:19.405
That is, no, she does not.
It's the sun across her face.

06:19.439 --> 06:22.842
That is practically a National
Geographic standard photograph.

06:22.875 --> 06:23.876
How are you doing
with that sandwich?

06:23.910 --> 06:26.512
Many of my patients have said

06:26.546 --> 06:29.248
that it looks like
a professional photographer.

06:29.282 --> 06:32.452
Yeah, but they are crazy, Henry.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.167
She's gonna be okay.

06:57.243 --> 07:00.113
- Can you just move your leg.
- Yeah.

07:00.145 --> 07:02.548
- Does that hurt?
- No, babe.

07:17.597 --> 07:19.499
I've got to answer that.

07:19.532 --> 07:21.968
- I have to answer that.
- Uh-unh!

07:33.980 --> 07:35.515
Really?

07:40.753 --> 07:42.121
I'm sorry.

07:42.155 --> 07:43.890
Uh, can you just get her last

07:43.923 --> 07:46.159
MRI scan ready for me please?

07:46.191 --> 07:48.661
No, there's a more recent one.

07:48.695 --> 07:50.897
There's a more recent one
than that.

07:50.930 --> 07:52.699
But that's... that's the one.

07:58.638 --> 08:00.039
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hm.

08:00.073 --> 08:02.875
- You gonna pick her up now?
- Yeah. I'll see you tonight.

08:02.909 --> 08:06.211
Oh, fuck. I love you

08:44.984 --> 08:46.285
Fuck!

08:46.319 --> 08:48.020
- We've got to go.
- Why?

08:48.054 --> 08:49.655
Wait!

08:49.689 --> 08:52.226
My violin! My violin.

08:52.258 --> 08:54.861
Duncan Abrahams is big
but he doesn't throw himself in.

08:54.894 --> 08:57.296
Oh, I know. Hello! Hello!

08:57.330 --> 08:58.998
<i>Oh, I know,
I'm sorry we left you...</i>

08:59.031 --> 09:01.467
He's got reach,
but he can hardly...

09:04.003 --> 09:06.506
<i>Come here, Zach.</i>

09:06.539 --> 09:08.007
Mum.

09:09.275 --> 09:11.577
<i>Hey, Zachy.</i>

09:16.482 --> 09:19.253
Uh, I'd like to report
a break-in.

09:19.285 --> 09:21.554
Fuck you, mum!

09:41.741 --> 09:43.676
You've got...

09:45.077 --> 09:47.079
...little trimmings
on your face.

09:47.113 --> 09:48.648
They're like, so pretty.

09:48.681 --> 09:51.818
- Like little gold...
- Just have your water, mum.

09:53.753 --> 09:55.888
What's it called?

09:55.922 --> 10:00.026
Is this a... style?

10:00.059 --> 10:01.494
I was going for rat's tails.

10:01.527 --> 10:03.930
You're a hairdresser,
are you, Moses?

10:03.963 --> 10:06.233
Mum trains Bichons.

10:06.266 --> 10:08.501
And that's how you know
about rats, is it?

10:08.534 --> 10:10.304
That's why I've got access
to clippers.

10:10.336 --> 10:12.004
They're poodle clippers,
but I use them on me as well.

10:12.038 --> 10:13.372
<i>I mean, you get a result
you're happy with</i>

10:13.406 --> 10:14.774
<i>using poodle clippers?</i>

10:14.807 --> 10:16.676
They're just like regular
clippers, mum.

10:16.709 --> 10:17.577
Bit louder maybe.

10:17.610 --> 10:19.145
They're probably a little bit

10:19.178 --> 10:20.546
less accurate, I imagine.

10:20.580 --> 10:22.648
<i>No. No.
We were competitive.</i>

10:22.682 --> 10:26.586
Mum's a three time state award
winner with her bichons.

10:26.619 --> 10:28.087
Oh, wow.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.422
How old are you, Moses?

10:29.455 --> 10:30.857
- I'm twenty...
- Sixteen.

10:30.890 --> 10:32.091
- ...three.
- Twenty.

10:32.124 --> 10:34.827
I'm twenty three.

10:34.861 --> 10:37.129
Well...

10:37.163 --> 10:38.931
I'm a bit freaked out by that.

10:38.965 --> 10:40.867
But, um, lucky for everyone

10:40.900 --> 10:43.135
I forgot I'd taken a Zoloft
when I took two Xanax

10:43.169 --> 10:45.239
while I was waiting for you
at the hairdresser to show up

10:45.272 --> 10:46.505
thinking you must've been
abducted

10:46.539 --> 10:48.541
because why else
would you not even come?

10:48.574 --> 10:50.710
We know that she's okay now.
Don't we?

10:50.743 --> 10:55.081
- God, two of those blues.
- Right?

10:55.114 --> 10:57.149
Those ones you gave me.

10:57.183 --> 11:01.255
Though I'm feeling
very relaxed right now.

11:02.322 --> 11:05.558
Feels like we...
I'm havin' a stroke.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.896
I can't feel this.

11:33.519 --> 11:36.088
You look like a different
person.

11:36.122 --> 11:38.292
Good.

11:38.325 --> 11:41.228
What have you done
with my daughter?

11:41.261 --> 11:42.595
I killed her.

11:44.364 --> 11:46.366
Oh, my God.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.469
She's got a great shaped head
for it.

11:50.503 --> 11:53.739
<i>We were nervous.
I mean, well, I was.</i>

11:53.773 --> 11:57.543
I was nervous,
because she was very overdue

11:57.576 --> 12:01.847
and had to be, have those, um...

12:02.815 --> 12:04.150
What's that word?

12:04.183 --> 12:07.053
Um... What do you call 'em?

12:07.086 --> 12:09.389
What's... what's that word?

12:10.656 --> 12:12.959
The... Henry, what is the,
what is that word?

12:12.992 --> 12:15.161
- The...
- Vase.

12:15.194 --> 12:16.896
- Vase?
- Forceps.

12:16.929 --> 12:20.833
She had to be induced but then
they used the forceps.

12:20.866 --> 12:23.135
And she started pulling them
right up inside me

12:23.169 --> 12:24.603
because she did not
wanna come out.

12:24.637 --> 12:26.105
And I was ripped to shreds.

12:26.138 --> 12:28.708
- <i>But we got in here, and we...</i>
- Oh, my God!

12:28.741 --> 12:32.279
Anna. Anna, let's go for a walk
around the block.

12:32.312 --> 12:36.749
Sorry, Milla.
I am so high, right now.

12:38.452 --> 12:40.820
You've got blood in your mouth.

12:40.853 --> 12:43.689
- What?
- Your mouth is bleeding.

12:46.192 --> 12:48.228
Oh, fuck.

12:48.261 --> 12:49.729
I've had this loose tooth.

12:49.762 --> 12:53.766
Not a baby tooth though,
only Milla has baby teeth.

12:53.799 --> 12:57.737
And it's an aberration
for someone as old as me.

12:57.770 --> 13:00.307
Which one is it?

13:00.340 --> 13:03.142
This one. At the back.

13:03.175 --> 13:05.077
- Show me.
- There.

13:05.111 --> 13:07.280
Oh! Hi there, little guy!

13:07.314 --> 13:10.317
- Get away from her!
- Mum!

13:14.020 --> 13:15.521
Ahem. Sorry, Moses.

13:15.554 --> 13:17.790
Don't apologies to him
for me.

13:17.823 --> 13:20.559
- Why is he even here?
- He's my guest!

13:20.593 --> 13:22.496
N... no.
No smoking.

13:22.528 --> 13:23.996
- Not in front of Milla!
- I'm sorry.

13:24.030 --> 13:26.132
- Outside! You take can it outside!
- Mum! Mum...

13:26.165 --> 13:29.503
Mum, he... You don't,
you don't have to go outside.

13:29.535 --> 13:31.505
Do you have that, um...

13:33.273 --> 13:35.242
Oh, yeah.

13:35.841 --> 13:37.910
Um... Yeah. Here.

13:42.715 --> 13:44.183
Here.

13:44.216 --> 13:45.718
Thanks for dinner.

13:47.521 --> 13:50.656
- I'll see you round.
- Where?

13:50.689 --> 13:53.659
- <i>Around.</i>
- You don't have to go.

14:14.247 --> 14:17.783
Henry! Henry!

14:17.817 --> 14:19.819
Fucking hell.

14:27.126 --> 14:29.329
It's a bit flat sweetheart.

14:45.579 --> 14:47.613
- It's still a bit flat.
- <i>Henry!</i>

14:47.646 --> 14:49.748
<i>You fucking mongrel.</i>

14:51.451 --> 14:53.986
<i>Henry!</i>

14:54.019 --> 14:55.721
<i>Who is she?</i>

14:55.754 --> 14:57.957
<i>We're gonna have to move.</i>

14:59.725 --> 15:02.229
<i>Henry!</i>

15:02.262 --> 15:05.831
We're lucky Gidon
can fit us in this morning.

15:05.865 --> 15:08.868
Maybe he can give you some
theory you can carry on with.

15:08.901 --> 15:12.339
Tell Ann that we're still aiming
to do the exam in March.

15:14.940 --> 15:16.041
Milla!

15:18.010 --> 15:19.312
What's wrong with you?

15:19.346 --> 15:21.481
What do you think's
wrong with me?

15:22.715 --> 15:26.152
You can't treat things
like this.

15:26.185 --> 15:29.456
What about you?
You were disgusting yesterday!

15:30.624 --> 15:33.826
Mill!
That boy had problems!

15:33.859 --> 15:35.728
So do I!

16:02.355 --> 16:03.789
<i>Bye, darling.</i>

16:21.740 --> 16:24.176
- Hey.
- Hello.

16:24.210 --> 16:26.346
Oh, shit! Shit, shit. Fuck.

16:26.379 --> 16:30.082
Fuck! Bit of ash.

16:30.115 --> 16:32.652
You shouldn't smoke,
yo... you know that.

16:32.686 --> 16:34.521
- Yeah. I need both hands.
- No.

16:34.554 --> 16:38.157
Because, you know,
you're pregnant, so...

16:38.190 --> 16:40.460
No, they did a study about that,
actually it's totally fine

16:40.493 --> 16:41.994
as long as you don't smoke
tailor-mades

16:42.027 --> 16:43.330
in the first trimester.

16:43.363 --> 16:44.930
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

16:44.964 --> 16:47.132
- I read it online.
- No, that's bullshit.

16:47.166 --> 16:49.569
There's no such thing
as a safe cigarette.

16:50.704 --> 16:53.373
It's not bullshit,
I read it online.

16:53.406 --> 16:55.107
Thanks.

16:56.108 --> 16:57.711
See you round.

17:06.185 --> 17:07.820
Henry!

17:09.689 --> 17:12.592
- I've lost my dog.
- Hm.

17:12.626 --> 17:13.826
<i>Probably just out, you know</i>

17:13.859 --> 17:15.395
checking out
his new neighborhood.

17:15.428 --> 17:19.232
<i>Yeah. Hopefully not stuck
to someone's bumper.</i>

17:21.967 --> 17:23.836
<i>Henry!</i>

17:25.204 --> 17:26.539
<i>Henry!</i>

17:27.474 --> 17:29.709
- I'm Toby.
- And I'm Henry.

17:29.743 --> 17:32.111
I... that's my name, Henry.

17:34.013 --> 17:37.717
- No, you're not.
- Yeah. Henry James Finlay.

17:40.886 --> 17:43.188
But Henry's a dog's name.

17:44.324 --> 17:47.059
Why didn't you say something?

17:50.730 --> 17:53.700
- Bye, Toby.
- Bye, Henry.

18:11.050 --> 18:12.885
<i>Go to hell.</i>

18:20.059 --> 18:22.928
Truly, I never hear
anything like, huh.

18:22.961 --> 18:25.964
Everything you touch
you destroy.

18:25.998 --> 18:27.634
Hm!

18:34.039 --> 18:36.776
Oh! Here we go.

18:43.416 --> 18:46.252
<i>Who did this to you? Huh?</i>

18:48.854 --> 18:51.324
<i>My boyfriend.</i>

18:51.358 --> 18:54.794
<i>Ah! You have boyfriend now?</i>

18:56.962 --> 19:00.500
<i>What kind of boyfriend
give you mange?</i>

19:00.533 --> 19:02.968
Well...

19:03.001 --> 19:05.170
...he's actually a wild dog.

19:05.204 --> 19:09.975
You know, with this new look,
you need something...

19:10.008 --> 19:13.813
...you need something like...

19:13.847 --> 19:16.349
...something like this.

19:16.383 --> 19:19.786
Eh?
Hm, hm, hm!

19:19.819 --> 19:21.954
Try, try, try. Yeah.

19:23.690 --> 19:26.726
Hey. Where your brother is?

19:26.760 --> 19:29.128
Hey, why are you not at school?

19:30.463 --> 19:32.298
You want to wait in here?

19:33.500 --> 19:35.602
<i>Inside?</i>

19:35.635 --> 19:38.538
<i>Come on, come on, yeah.</i>

19:38.571 --> 19:39.739
<i>Yeah, come on, come on.</i>

19:46.780 --> 19:50.316
Come on. We have biscuits!

19:50.350 --> 19:53.085
We have coffee!

19:53.118 --> 19:55.020
Dancing girls!

19:56.523 --> 19:58.725
- What's your name?
- Tin Wah.

19:58.758 --> 20:00.660
Taking the day off school,
Tin Wah?

20:00.693 --> 20:03.463
- Missed the bus.
- Yeah, right.

20:08.268 --> 20:12.070
Ah, you know this?

20:12.104 --> 20:15.241
Eh, here.

20:15.275 --> 20:17.444
Put your chin here.

20:17.477 --> 20:19.279
Like that. Yes.

20:19.312 --> 20:22.315
Comfortable.

20:22.348 --> 20:23.917
<i>Comfortable.</i>

22:38.384 --> 22:39.919
Shh!

22:39.953 --> 22:42.422
Don't move.
Don't you fuckin' move.

22:42.455 --> 22:44.057
It's okay.

22:44.089 --> 22:46.392
<i>Don't come any closer.
Shh! Don't move.</i>

22:46.426 --> 22:48.261
Don't fuckin' move.

22:57.202 --> 22:59.171
That'll just make you feel sick.

22:59.204 --> 23:01.441
That'll just make you sick.

23:08.948 --> 23:10.583
These ones have got
codeine in them

23:10.617 --> 23:13.319
<i>these ones will make you
feel calmer.</i>

23:13.353 --> 23:15.421
- <i>Mum!</i>
- Ah! Just get out.

23:15.455 --> 23:17.757
- I won't tell anyone. Go!
- <i>Mum!</i>

23:17.790 --> 23:21.327
Coming sweetheart!
Go, go, go.

23:21.361 --> 23:23.161
- Milla! Henry! Henry!
- Shh!

23:23.195 --> 23:24.330
Hey! Shut up. Shut up.

23:24.364 --> 23:27.367
- Just get out! Get out!
- Alright!

23:27.400 --> 23:30.737
<i>Milla, don't come in here.
Go back to your room. Now!</i>

23:30.770 --> 23:32.238
Moses?

23:35.241 --> 23:38.578
- Oh, Milla.
- Are you ripping us off?

23:39.512 --> 23:41.146
Oh, this is so bad.

23:41.179 --> 23:44.216
- Oh, God.
- He was in the kitchen.

23:44.250 --> 23:45.818
- Have you called the police?
- No!

23:45.852 --> 23:48.254
When would I have had a chance
to call the police, Henry?

23:48.287 --> 23:50.188
If you call the police
we're totally entering

23:50.222 --> 23:51.424
the cycle of abuse, Henry.

23:51.457 --> 23:53.459
That is 100% your fault.

23:53.493 --> 23:55.561
Please, dad. I won't be able
to respect you if you do.

23:55.595 --> 23:58.331
What's his... What's your
surname? I'll call his parents.

23:58.364 --> 24:00.165
- Please don't.
- He's been thrown out of home.

24:00.198 --> 24:02.568
- It's complicated.
- His mum's troubled.

24:02.602 --> 24:04.237
Then I have to call the police.

24:04.270 --> 24:05.938
I just don't think
that's right for him.

24:05.972 --> 24:08.474
Milla, he threatened me
with a meat prong.

24:08.508 --> 24:10.143
You threatened my wife
with a meat prong?

24:10.175 --> 24:11.544
No, I wouldn't have
done anything.

24:11.577 --> 24:14.480
Mum, I'll... I'll do anything.
I will.

24:14.514 --> 24:16.716
I'll... I'll... I'll practice
the violin

24:16.749 --> 24:18.284
and I'll go to support.

24:18.317 --> 24:20.086
And the fucking formal, I'll go.

24:20.119 --> 24:23.690
Can he just please stay?

24:23.723 --> 24:26.325
Anna, we can't do this.

24:27.694 --> 24:30.029
He was remarkably inept, Henry.

24:30.063 --> 24:31.998
And he's probably harmless.

24:32.031 --> 24:33.166
He's a drug addict.

24:33.198 --> 24:34.667
Don't pigeonhole him like that.

24:34.701 --> 24:37.637
<i>Hey, thanks for being
so kind to me.</i>

24:37.670 --> 24:40.139
You're so kind to me.

24:40.173 --> 24:43.443
- I lost my hair.
- It looks cool.

24:43.476 --> 24:45.578
It's like way better
than the one that I gave you.

24:45.611 --> 24:48.748
Anna, if there's no consequences

24:48.781 --> 24:50.016
he's going to be
back here again...

24:50.049 --> 24:51.484
- Anna? Anna!
- What?

24:51.517 --> 24:53.686
I just need you to listen to me
and think this through.

24:53.720 --> 24:55.154
I didn't invite him here, Henry.

24:55.188 --> 24:56.589
The boy is desperate.

24:56.622 --> 24:58.024
<i>I was dreaming about you
actually</i>

24:58.057 --> 25:00.226
<i>when you came in.</i>

25:00.259 --> 25:02.228
You were dreaming about me?

25:02.261 --> 25:03.996
Yeah.

25:04.030 --> 25:06.165
N... not...

25:06.199 --> 25:08.868
No, we weren't doing anything...

25:08.901 --> 25:10.636
You were just...

25:10.670 --> 25:14.107
<i>...you were just
sort of... there.</i>

25:20.113 --> 25:22.115
It's morning.

25:23.850 --> 25:26.252
He could stay for breakfast.

26:01.387 --> 26:02.655
<i>Milla!</i>

26:02.688 --> 26:04.223
Breakfast.

26:05.458 --> 26:07.727
He must have fallen off his bike
or something.

26:07.760 --> 26:10.296
He's got this scar.

26:14.133 --> 26:15.968
- Morning.
- Morning.

26:16.002 --> 26:17.603
Sit down.

26:21.340 --> 26:24.310
- Sorry about last night.
- Do you have a girlfriend?

26:25.945 --> 26:28.347
Uh, I wouldn't call her
a girlfriend.

26:28.381 --> 26:30.583
- How old is she?
- She's 26.

26:30.616 --> 26:32.652
Sounds very appropriate.

26:33.853 --> 26:36.422
- You're making crepes?
- Mm-hm.

26:36.455 --> 26:38.258
Well, well.

26:41.527 --> 26:44.897
So, Moses, what have you got
planned for the day?

26:44.931 --> 26:47.133
You, uh,
you working at the moment?

26:47.166 --> 26:49.135
Not in any formal way.

26:49.168 --> 26:52.738
And, um, informally?
What do you do?

26:52.772 --> 26:54.607
All different things.

26:54.640 --> 26:58.377
Oh. Mm-hm.

26:58.411 --> 27:01.180
You think there's something
that I should be doing?

27:02.715 --> 27:04.150
No.

27:05.484 --> 27:08.688
I don't think the world would be
this big or weird

27:08.721 --> 27:10.324
if we were meant to choose
just one thing.

27:10.356 --> 27:13.260
I think as soon as people start

27:13.293 --> 27:15.494
doing that they become obsessed
with functionality

27:15.528 --> 27:17.063
instead of is it beautiful?

27:17.096 --> 27:20.267
Hm, it's true.
That is what happens.

27:20.300 --> 27:22.134
I'm not ready to be functional.

27:22.168 --> 27:24.070
Of course that doesn't mean
you have to be dysfunctional.

27:24.103 --> 27:25.972
Henry!

27:26.005 --> 27:27.307
What is it you do, sir?

27:27.341 --> 27:29.442
He's a psychiatrist.

27:29.475 --> 27:32.879
I guess you think that you can
pin me like that.

27:34.647 --> 27:37.884
- Mill, you better get ready...
- Having my breakfast.

27:37.917 --> 27:39.452
Sorry.

27:45.758 --> 27:47.560
Don't leave.

27:50.763 --> 27:52.732
I can drop you at home
after this Moses.

27:52.765 --> 27:54.634
Oh, no, I... I don't want to
put you out...

27:54.667 --> 27:55.868
No, no trouble.

27:55.902 --> 27:58.404
I can do it after I've dropped
Milla at school.

27:58.437 --> 28:01.507
Hey, Moses, I don't know if you
make a habit of this or not

28:01.540 --> 28:03.310
that is befriending girls

28:03.343 --> 28:05.312
that are significantly
younger than yourself.

28:05.345 --> 28:09.181
But Milla's in a very
vulnerable situation...

28:12.685 --> 28:14.520
Goddamn.

28:23.496 --> 28:24.931
Fuck!

28:24.964 --> 28:26.198
Henry, can you grab his collar?

28:26.233 --> 28:27.767
- Yeah.
- Sorry. He's a car-chaser.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.502
No problem.

28:29.535 --> 28:31.405
Hey, um, can you come and stand
on a stool for me?

28:31.437 --> 28:33.105
- All my lights keep blowing.
- Um...

28:33.139 --> 28:35.808
I don't trust myself within five
meters of a stool at the moment.

28:35.841 --> 28:37.344
Um, I've just, I've got...

28:37.377 --> 28:39.779
- I've got patients that are waiting.
- Okay.

28:39.812 --> 28:41.281
Okay.

28:43.383 --> 28:45.319
- See ya.
- Bye.

28:46.786 --> 28:48.255
Henry.

29:10.910 --> 29:13.179
I wanna see you again.

29:13.846 --> 29:15.681
No way.

29:15.715 --> 29:17.183
<i>Milla!</i>

29:20.219 --> 29:21.854
Okay, bye, mum.

29:21.887 --> 29:23.390
You'll let me know

29:23.423 --> 29:25.958
and I'll come and get you
if it's too much.

29:25.992 --> 29:27.461
Bye.

29:30.963 --> 29:33.467
- Where do you live, Moses?
- <i>Uh, just drop me up here.</i>

29:33.499 --> 29:35.901
Oh, no, I'll take you home.

29:38.804 --> 29:41.207
Thanks for the lift,
Mrs. Finlay.

29:41.241 --> 29:42.675
Moses!

29:47.913 --> 29:49.582
Thank you.

29:50.850 --> 29:53.387
I don't want you near
Milla again.

29:57.990 --> 29:59.792
Yes, alright.

30:04.096 --> 30:06.899
<i>I felt my, my body go cold.</i>

30:08.868 --> 30:10.803
<i>Like I knew.</i>

30:14.274 --> 30:16.008
<i>If I'd have just said...</i>

30:16.042 --> 30:17.676
God, if I'd just said don't.

30:17.710 --> 30:20.212
If I'd just said
don't leave me...

30:20.247 --> 30:22.349
J... Jenny can I,
would you just ex...

30:22.382 --> 30:24.183
...just excuse me
for one moment, please.

30:24.216 --> 30:25.551
Mm-hm.

30:45.638 --> 30:47.573
I'm gonna change that bulb.

30:50.042 --> 30:52.345
- Thanks.
- Right.

30:57.317 --> 31:00.387
Um, hold on a sec.

31:00.420 --> 31:02.688
- <i>Got it?</i>
- Yeah, not yet.

31:03.823 --> 31:06.759
Ah, there we go.

31:07.993 --> 31:10.096
- Fuck!
- Fuck! Fuck!

31:11.498 --> 31:13.065
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
- No, no.

31:13.099 --> 31:15.935
The electrics in these houses,
they're fucking crazy.

31:15.968 --> 31:17.437
- Can you sit down?
- Oh, no, I'm okay.

31:17.471 --> 31:20.507
I'm so sorry, Henry.
I'm so sorry.

31:20.540 --> 31:21.941
- Sit down. Please sit down.
- I'm okay.

31:21.974 --> 31:23.376
- No, I'm okay, I'm okay.
- Please, sit down.

31:23.410 --> 31:25.845
- I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm fine.
- God!

31:25.878 --> 31:27.680
- Hope you're not brain damaged.
- No, I'm fine.

31:27.713 --> 31:29.048
Can I get you some water? Do you
want me to get you some water?

31:29.081 --> 31:30.584
- I'm fine.
- Fuck. Are you allowed water?

31:30.616 --> 31:32.751
What's that rule
with hair dryers?

31:34.854 --> 31:37.923
Oh, you can see
straight into our house.

31:37.957 --> 31:40.192
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:40.227 --> 31:42.094
Okay. Can I just...

31:42.128 --> 31:43.563
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Your hair's sticking up.

31:43.597 --> 31:45.064
Can I just...
Can you wait a second?

31:45.097 --> 31:47.467
Wait, I've got something
that will be perfect.

31:54.274 --> 31:58.077
This is gel,
but it smooths the hair.

31:58.110 --> 32:00.614
Um, can I...
Okay, you do it.

32:00.679 --> 32:02.982
Just don't be shy of it,
i... i... it goes completely...

32:03.015 --> 32:05.285
Actually, no, let me, here.

33:20.025 --> 33:22.828
Was that your boyfriend dropping
you off this morning?

33:22.861 --> 33:24.331
Yeah.

33:24.364 --> 33:27.066
Are you bringing him
to the formal?

33:27.099 --> 33:29.034
Think so.

33:29.068 --> 33:31.003
What school does he go to?

33:32.104 --> 33:33.839
He's left school.

33:35.007 --> 33:36.842
My boyfriend's 18.

33:38.210 --> 33:39.912
I love your wig.

33:39.945 --> 33:42.415
I wanna get extensions
for the formal.

33:42.449 --> 33:44.783
- <i>Cool.</i>
- Yeah.

33:44.817 --> 33:47.152
- Can I try it on?
- No.

33:47.186 --> 33:49.922
<i>Just to see how I'll look
with long hair.</i>

33:52.925 --> 33:56.296
- Just for a second.
- No.

33:56.329 --> 33:59.633
Please? I'll be quick.
I'll give it right back. Please?

34:01.468 --> 34:03.603
<i>Ha-ha. Yeah?</i>

34:27.126 --> 34:31.030
Oh, my God.
I look so different.

34:46.613 --> 34:48.914
It's to show my hairdresser.

34:50.082 --> 34:52.786
Oh, yeah, I love that.

34:57.590 --> 34:59.759
It's better on you.

35:44.504 --> 35:46.105
<i>Oi!</i>

35:50.510 --> 35:53.879
- What're you doing here?
- What're you doing here?

35:53.912 --> 35:57.317
- It's my school.
- It's my school.

35:57.350 --> 35:59.084
<i>It's an all girl's school.</i>

36:00.320 --> 36:01.554
- Shit.

36:02.955 --> 36:04.223
Hey!

36:05.392 --> 36:07.192
Stop it.

36:25.545 --> 36:27.946
- <i>Milla?</i>
- What?

36:29.682 --> 36:31.851
<i>Where have you been?</i>

36:31.885 --> 36:34.454
- Ah, with Scarlett.
- Hey, sweetheart.

36:34.487 --> 36:36.623
- Hi.
- Feeling okay?

36:36.656 --> 36:39.091
Mm, okay.

36:41.561 --> 36:44.831
You should invite her over.

36:44.864 --> 36:48.635
Or is her mum still paying her
to be on that paleo diet?

36:48.668 --> 36:50.904
Mum, um...

36:50.936 --> 36:54.006
...I need some money
for tickets to the formal.

36:56.743 --> 36:59.245
- Okay.
- <i>Okay.</i>

37:01.748 --> 37:03.850
We'll have to go shopping
for a dress too.

37:03.883 --> 37:06.319
<i>Do you have any... any ideas?</i>

37:06.352 --> 37:07.754
Mm-hm.

37:07.787 --> 37:10.423
Maybe we could take tomorrow
morning off and...

37:10.457 --> 37:11.724
...go shopping.

37:11.758 --> 37:14.159
I don't want to miss
any more school.

37:16.796 --> 37:19.599
Are people taking partners, or...

37:19.632 --> 37:20.900
Oh, don't!

37:20.934 --> 37:22.769
Th... that's because
foreign policy

37:22.802 --> 37:26.205
in this country is based
on this small mindedness.

37:26.239 --> 37:28.475
Would you like me to ask
Andrea's son?

37:28.508 --> 37:30.042
Leif?

37:34.280 --> 37:37.082
I'm not going with Leif.

37:38.751 --> 37:40.787
<i>...especially about
this strange</i>

37:40.820 --> 37:43.756
<i>effusive character
that was Mozart.</i>

37:43.790 --> 37:45.859
<i>It's unique music</i>

37:45.892 --> 37:48.461
<i>for expressing
tragic sentiment.</i>

37:48.495 --> 37:52.465
<i>Always with open-eyed wonder
for the world.</i>

37:52.499 --> 37:53.833
<i>Never is it cynical.</i>

37:53.867 --> 37:56.168
<i>It can be dark,
it can be menacing</i>

37:56.201 --> 37:58.304
<i>but essentially
it's extraordinarily</i>

37:58.338 --> 37:59.873
<i>optimistic music.</i>

37:59.906 --> 38:01.975
<i>And when Mozart is at his peak</i>

38:02.007 --> 38:05.177
<i>and sometimes he doesn't
always reach his peak</i>

38:05.210 --> 38:07.614
<i>but when Mozart does write
at his peak</i>

38:07.647 --> 38:09.649
<i>such as the "25th Symphony"</i>

38:09.682 --> 38:10.950
<i>you're dealing with something</i>

38:10.984 --> 38:14.420
<i>that's indescribably
extraordinary.</i>

38:14.454 --> 38:17.557
<i>Um, this is an exploration
of the music of Mozart...</i>

38:51.658 --> 38:54.894
I think something in you
is changed.

39:00.400 --> 39:02.067
What could it be?

39:02.100 --> 39:06.039
I see the same in your mother
when she is in love.

39:06.071 --> 39:08.775
<i>Is when she is becoming
drunk with it.</i>

39:08.808 --> 39:11.209
When she met dad, you mean?

39:15.048 --> 39:18.885
- <i>You were crazy about her.</i>
- Of course.

39:18.918 --> 39:21.721
- We play Shostakovich together.
- Were you together?

39:21.754 --> 39:23.022
<i>You never observe
this crescendo.</i>

39:23.056 --> 39:24.057
- Were you?
- <i>Look.</i>

39:24.089 --> 39:26.759
How many times I underline.

39:26.793 --> 39:29.662
You're not so breathless
this time.

39:29.696 --> 39:32.398
Come, lifting the wings...

39:38.738 --> 39:41.641
When you play this with focus

39:41.674 --> 39:44.811
it can make the heart so big.

39:44.844 --> 39:48.448
When you do bird calls
is so stupid.

40:09.469 --> 40:11.136
What're you looking at?

40:13.706 --> 40:15.308
Piss off

41:45.398 --> 41:48.000
Hi. Hi, Mrs. Finlay.
Is Milla here?

41:48.034 --> 41:50.570
- No. She's not.
- I brought her these.

41:50.603 --> 41:52.538
I brought her a present.

41:54.574 --> 41:56.109
You weren't in school.

41:56.142 --> 41:58.177
I didn't go today.

42:00.046 --> 42:02.048
Did you run here?

42:02.081 --> 42:04.250
I've been playing basketball.

42:04.283 --> 42:06.319
- Do you want to do something?
- No. She has to rest.

42:06.352 --> 42:09.422
- We can sit out back.
- No.

42:17.463 --> 42:19.632
Milla. Milla.

42:19.665 --> 42:21.567
- What are you thinking?
- What?

42:21.601 --> 42:24.570
Well, can't you see
the state he's in?

42:31.677 --> 42:34.080
Sorry, I couldn't find a cup.

43:12.151 --> 43:14.254
<i>I wanted to ask you something.</i>

43:14.288 --> 43:16.022
Uh-huh.

43:17.423 --> 43:20.126
Will you come to my school
formal?

43:24.697 --> 43:27.366
Aren't I a bit old for it?

43:27.400 --> 43:28.701
No.

43:31.204 --> 43:33.172
Do I have to wear a suit?

43:34.640 --> 43:36.609
I don't think so.

43:40.580 --> 43:42.615
I'd like to wear one.

43:46.619 --> 43:48.621
Oh, my God.

43:50.223 --> 43:51.657
My heart's beating so fast

43:51.691 --> 43:54.594
it feels like having a heart
attack or something.

43:55.695 --> 43:57.496
Feel that.

43:59.732 --> 44:02.635
I didn't think
it would be like that.

44:24.624 --> 44:27.760
- I think I'm going throw up.
- Hey?

44:30.429 --> 44:31.731
Mum!

44:35.335 --> 44:36.903
- Mum!
- Are you alright?

44:36.936 --> 44:39.071
Can you get me an Ondansetron?

44:39.105 --> 44:42.708
Sit up. Sit up. Sit up.

44:44.311 --> 44:47.513
Can you sit up? Milla.

44:47.546 --> 44:50.250
I know you have it.
It was right next to the phone.

44:50.284 --> 44:52.286
Give it to me right now.

44:57.056 --> 44:59.058
That's not it.

45:01.027 --> 45:03.397
Will you still come
to my formal?

45:03.429 --> 45:04.530
- No, he won't.
- Sorry.

45:04.563 --> 45:06.832
- Mo?
- No, he won't Milla.

45:06.866 --> 45:08.402
Have some self-respect.

45:08.434 --> 45:10.803
Is that why
you hang out with me?

45:10.836 --> 45:12.204
Yes.

45:12.239 --> 45:14.640
Is it the only reason?

45:17.109 --> 45:18.678
Is it?

45:20.646 --> 45:23.582
<i>You have to leave Moses and you
can never come back here.</i>

45:29.588 --> 45:32.458
Sit up, honey.
Sit up, honey.

45:32.491 --> 45:35.094
Come on. Have another sip.

45:40.066 --> 45:41.667
Fuck!

45:42.835 --> 45:45.204
Fuck it! Fuck!

46:25.578 --> 46:28.382
- Yeah, nice. Yo.
- Hey, Mo, Bambi's here.

46:28.415 --> 46:29.682
Hey?

46:40.593 --> 46:42.429
The hell are you doing here?

46:42.462 --> 46:44.597
What the hell
are you doing here?

46:45.664 --> 46:47.767
Does your mum know
where you are?

46:47.800 --> 46:49.469
Does yours?

46:53.473 --> 46:56.443
You can't hang.
I've got to go to work now.

48:33.340 --> 48:35.908
Tracy Marrow?

48:35.941 --> 48:37.743
Yes, sir.

48:48.622 --> 48:51.324
- Cheers mate.
- Yep.

49:01.133 --> 49:04.638
My brother's doing a party
tonight. You should come.

49:06.573 --> 49:07.973
Alright.

49:15.415 --> 49:17.016
<i>Where's it at?</i>

49:17.049 --> 49:19.785
- <i>Brian's place.</i>
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

49:46.379 --> 49:49.114
Hey, we won't stay here long,
okay?

49:49.148 --> 49:51.418
Unless it's really fun.

49:54.287 --> 49:56.323
You're really pretty.

50:15.841 --> 50:18.077
I love this.

50:18.110 --> 50:20.746
Are you avoiding me?

50:20.779 --> 50:21.914
No.

50:23.048 --> 50:24.351
Good.

50:30.022 --> 50:32.325
<i>Hey, Mill, do you want to...
Mill?</i>

50:32.359 --> 50:35.528
- <i>Do you wanna go dance?</i>
- Yeah.

50:35.562 --> 50:37.631
<i>I'll meet you in there.</i>

50:37.664 --> 50:39.733
<i>Are you babysitting?</i>

52:36.249 --> 52:37.817
<i>Hey.</i>

52:40.387 --> 52:42.789
Hey.
Can you get me a drink?

53:44.216 --> 53:46.386
Hey. Hey! Are you drunk?

53:46.419 --> 53:48.120
- Where's your girlfriend?
- Hey?

53:48.153 --> 53:50.122
Where's your girlfriend?

53:52.725 --> 53:54.294
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

53:54.327 --> 53:56.362
Fucking loser.

53:56.396 --> 53:58.898
Hey! Fuck! Fuck off!

54:00.165 --> 54:01.234
<i>Hey!</i>

54:08.374 --> 54:10.108
You okay?

54:15.915 --> 54:18.618
What is this?
What did you take? Mill?

54:20.986 --> 54:22.288
Vodka.

54:24.089 --> 54:26.559
Are you allowed to drink
on your medication?

54:27.794 --> 54:29.696
It's never come up.

54:31.231 --> 54:35.000
- I'm gonna ring your parents.
- No.

54:35.033 --> 54:38.404
No. Not yet, Mo.

54:38.438 --> 54:39.973
Not yet.

56:41.728 --> 56:43.429

56:44.797 --> 56:47.165
You see that?
That's your school.

56:47.199 --> 56:50.403
- Uh-huh.
- This down here is, um...

56:50.436 --> 56:52.038
When, uh...

56:55.108 --> 56:57.744
That's, uh, where we were today.

56:59.879 --> 57:02.081
Moses, do you like me?

57:06.886 --> 57:08.888
Obviously.

57:09.922 --> 57:12.825
But do you like, like-like me?

57:25.038 --> 57:26.305
Hey.

57:27.774 --> 57:29.442
It's complicated.

57:31.944 --> 57:34.347
I don't wanna hurt you.

57:37.483 --> 57:39.385
So don't.

58:07.013 --> 58:08.848
I'll be back in a minute.

58:08.881 --> 58:10.249
- I'm coming with you.
- No, no. No, no.

58:10.283 --> 58:12.318
Go back to sleep.
Go back to sleep.

58:25.932 --> 58:30.069
She didn't take any
of her medicine?

58:30.103 --> 58:33.005
I hope he doesn't just stick
a needle in her arm.

58:33.039 --> 58:35.908
Why did she not at least take
her phone with her?

58:37.443 --> 58:39.912
Come on, Milla.

58:39.946 --> 58:42.115
How did we not see this coming?

58:44.450 --> 58:45.918
Henry?

58:47.320 --> 58:49.756
Did you hear me?

58:49.789 --> 58:51.557
I'm up with her every night,
Henry.

58:51.591 --> 58:54.293
Her body gets so hot.
You're never there.

58:54.327 --> 58:57.764
I am. I'm there. I'm always
there. You just don't notice.

58:57.797 --> 58:59.233
<i>Well, I can't find you.</i>

58:59.265 --> 59:02.001
Even now I have no idea
what you're feeling.

59:02.034 --> 59:03.703
'Cause you don't tell me.

59:03.736 --> 59:07.273
<i>Tell me Henry, because I feel
so alone right now.</i>

59:07.306 --> 59:08.741
This really isn't about you,
Anna.

59:08.775 --> 59:10.009
It... it... it is.

59:10.042 --> 59:12.078
It's really not about
how you feel!

59:12.111 --> 59:15.114
This is about Milla,
for God's sake!

59:15.148 --> 59:17.150
Wh... what's wrong with you?

59:17.183 --> 59:18.618
Our daughter has disappeared.

59:18.651 --> 59:20.720
She might not make it
through the night

59:20.753 --> 59:22.088
and, and, and

59:22.121 --> 59:24.490
a... a I can't feel anything

59:24.524 --> 59:25.625
because I can't breathe.

59:25.658 --> 59:27.760
'Cause you take up all the air.

59:27.794 --> 59:30.062
<i>Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Okay.</i>

59:30.096 --> 59:32.565
<i>Anna, I'm sorry.
Anna, darling, I'm sorry.</i>

59:32.598 --> 59:34.901
<i>I just want to find...</i>

59:34.934 --> 59:36.969
Excuse me.

59:38.070 --> 59:41.140
Have you seen this girl?
Excuse me.

59:41.174 --> 59:43.543
Can you just look?

59:44.844 --> 59:48.648
Excuse me.
Have you seen this girl?

59:48.681 --> 59:51.017
Ha... have you seen this girl?

1:00:57.450 --> 1:00:59.986
Let's go home.

1:01:00.686 --> 1:01:03.055
Oh, baby.

1:01:08.094 --> 1:01:10.997
Not yet, sweetheart.

1:01:11.030 --> 1:01:13.432
You've got a chest infection.

1:01:17.503 --> 1:01:19.405
Please, mum.

1:01:21.107 --> 1:01:23.910
We have to get you better first.

1:01:23.943 --> 1:01:25.645
It won't take long.

1:01:25.678 --> 1:01:29.181
- You always say that.
- It's true this time.

1:01:32.184 --> 1:01:34.186
You say that too.

1:01:34.220 --> 1:01:37.324
Mill! Mill, stop it!

1:01:37.357 --> 1:01:39.959
Milla! What, are you trying
to kill yourself?

1:01:39.992 --> 1:01:42.329
He won't find me here.

1:01:42.362 --> 1:01:43.529
Milla.

1:01:46.666 --> 1:01:49.101
Come on, darling.

1:01:49.135 --> 1:01:51.604
Come back here. Come on.

1:01:58.678 --> 1:02:02.481
<i>He... Henry, can you come
and feel the water pressure?</i>

1:02:03.482 --> 1:02:05.751
<i>Henry?</i>

1:02:05.785 --> 1:02:08.454
Darling, I checked it
this morning. It was fine.

1:02:08.487 --> 1:02:11.991
<i>Well, it's very weak now.
Can you come and feel it.</i>

1:02:15.094 --> 1:02:16.929
<i>Henry!</i>

1:02:16.963 --> 1:02:19.433
I felt it this morning,
it was fine.

1:02:20.766 --> 1:02:23.169
Henry, just come and check
the water pressure

1:02:23.202 --> 1:02:27.139
with my concerns in mind
and see if it's too weak.

1:02:27.173 --> 1:02:30.676
It's just a basic conjugal duty.
Jesus!

1:02:30.710 --> 1:02:34.348
Hey, there's water there.
Don't slip.

1:02:34.381 --> 1:02:37.384
Hurry up. Come on, I've got to
get to the hospital.

1:02:41.020 --> 1:02:43.723
Milla's obsessed with that boy.

1:02:43.756 --> 1:02:46.892
- She's a smart girl.
- This is her first love.

1:02:46.926 --> 1:02:49.996
- She'll get over it.
- You don't just get over it.

1:02:50.029 --> 1:02:51.431
I'm pretty sure
that she won't be

1:02:51.465 --> 1:02:54.434
strong enough to save herself.

1:02:54.468 --> 1:02:58.204
- She's not like you, Anna.
- I'm not saying that she is.

1:02:58.238 --> 1:02:59.373
What do you mean?

1:02:59.406 --> 1:03:01.274
- It's fine.
- No, it's...

1:03:01.308 --> 1:03:02.875
Exactly the same the same
as it was this morning.

1:03:02.908 --> 1:03:05.345
- Have you taken your Ativan?
- It's still weak.

1:03:05.379 --> 1:03:07.347
Have you taken your Ativan?
Because you'd better.

1:03:07.381 --> 1:03:09.749
- I don't take them anymore.
- Since when?

1:03:09.782 --> 1:03:13.119
Since Milla came back.
I'm off everything.

1:03:13.152 --> 1:03:15.955
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Uh-uh.

1:03:15.988 --> 1:03:17.424
This is the worst
possible timing.

1:03:17.457 --> 1:03:20.460
I don't want to miss anything,
Henry.

1:03:21.961 --> 1:03:24.163
I'm fine without them, you know.

1:03:24.196 --> 1:03:26.565
- Just my back's been...
- No.

1:03:26.599 --> 1:03:29.503
- What're you doing?
- You're just exhausting.

1:03:29.535 --> 1:03:32.406
Okay, it was the shower, Henry.
It's reasonable.

1:03:32.439 --> 1:03:34.573
No. It's not reasonable, Anna.

1:03:34.607 --> 1:03:38.677
It's... it's,
it's not reasonable Anna.

1:03:38.711 --> 1:03:40.380
You just, you cannot

1:03:40.414 --> 1:03:45.519
cannot, cannot, cannot,
cannot lose it yet.

1:03:45.551 --> 1:03:47.454
You cannot.

1:04:04.271 --> 1:04:06.239
Mm-hmm. Ah-ha.

1:04:06.273 --> 1:04:09.742
But you see, uh, uh,
this violin is mine.

1:04:09.775 --> 1:04:12.645
It's too big.

1:04:12.678 --> 1:04:15.147
Milla learned that song.

1:04:15.181 --> 1:04:17.183
Yeah.
He is in love with her.

1:04:17.216 --> 1:04:19.319
- No, I'm not!
- You are.

1:04:19.352 --> 1:04:21.887
You don't know yet. Eh. Here.

1:04:21.921 --> 1:04:25.057
<i>Here, go and get yourself
a coffee, uh</i>

1:04:25.091 --> 1:04:27.494
or whatever you like, huh?

1:04:27.527 --> 1:04:31.130
Come back with longer arms
please and we will work more.

1:04:33.467 --> 1:04:35.335
What?

1:04:35.368 --> 1:04:37.304
It's good to see you.

1:04:39.805 --> 1:04:44.244
Can you turn...
Can you turn to face the piano?

1:04:45.678 --> 1:04:48.448
Please. Come on.

1:04:48.482 --> 1:04:51.217
- Mm...
- Come on.

1:04:51.251 --> 1:04:53.253
Oh, stop it.

1:04:56.590 --> 1:04:59.892
Anna, please. Play with me.

1:05:00.759 --> 1:05:02.795
I don't want to.

1:05:02.828 --> 1:05:05.499
I believe you do want to.

1:05:06.765 --> 1:05:08.200
Hm?

1:05:15.007 --> 1:05:16.642
Gidon, stop... Stop it!

1:05:20.514 --> 1:05:22.681
We can fight if you want to.

1:05:23.450 --> 1:05:25.418
Is that why you come?

1:05:37.464 --> 1:05:39.432
Do you remember
when we were doing the Sculhof

1:05:39.466 --> 1:05:41.167
how I couldn't go on?

1:05:41.200 --> 1:05:42.469
Hm.

1:05:44.571 --> 1:05:47.240
- In Hamburg, remember?
- Hm.

1:05:51.810 --> 1:05:54.281
Milla was five months...

1:05:54.314 --> 1:05:55.915
...and I left her crying
with that woman

1:05:55.948 --> 1:05:57.950
I couldn't even understand.

1:06:02.522 --> 1:06:04.723
I wasn't ready to stop then.

1:06:06.459 --> 1:06:08.928
I should have been the one
who was holding her.

1:06:13.567 --> 1:06:15.768
I want that time back.

1:06:15.801 --> 1:06:19.673
You think Milla will get better
if you stop playing?

1:06:22.676 --> 1:06:25.211
I don't have anything else
to give.

1:06:25.245 --> 1:06:28.582
Fuck the tiny gods
in your head, Anna.

1:06:28.615 --> 1:06:33.353
Milla's mother plays the piano.

1:06:40.793 --> 1:06:43.896
Hi! Henry! Henry!

1:06:43.929 --> 1:06:45.764
Henry!

1:06:46.999 --> 1:06:48.767
Fuck! Henry!

1:06:48.801 --> 1:06:50.470
Motherfucker.

1:06:51.571 --> 1:06:53.872
I unpacked the cups last night.

1:06:53.906 --> 1:06:55.841
Do you wanna come
and have a cup of tea with me?

1:06:55.874 --> 1:06:58.712
Well, what... Uh...

1:06:58.744 --> 1:07:01.814
W... what have you been using
for the last month?

1:07:01.847 --> 1:07:03.015
Jars.

1:07:12.091 --> 1:07:14.327
- You alright?
- Yeah.

1:07:15.362 --> 1:07:16.929
Me too.

1:07:18.598 --> 1:07:20.966
This baby's such an asshole
though.

1:07:22.335 --> 1:07:24.036
He's kicking me
all the fucking time now.

1:07:24.069 --> 1:07:26.171
Hm.

1:07:26.205 --> 1:07:27.773
Come here.

1:07:29.141 --> 1:07:30.209
Oh!

1:07:30.243 --> 1:07:31.478
That's his bum there. Is it?

1:07:31.511 --> 1:07:33.580
Yeah, there... And shoulder.

1:07:33.613 --> 1:07:36.750
Ah. Oh-ho! It's quite lively.

1:07:36.782 --> 1:07:38.451
- Did you feel that?
- Yeah.

1:07:38.485 --> 1:07:39.985
He likes the sound
of your voice.

1:07:40.019 --> 1:07:41.521
Yeah.

1:07:55.235 --> 1:07:58.505
I'm... sorry.

1:07:58.538 --> 1:07:59.938
It was nice.

1:07:59.972 --> 1:08:02.174
- Shit.
- No, no. It doesn't matter.

1:08:02.207 --> 1:08:03.677
Sorry.

1:08:09.181 --> 1:08:10.750
Uh, sorry.

1:08:35.608 --> 1:08:39.346
- I brought you some...
- Yeah, I don't...

1:08:40.280 --> 1:08:42.349
I don't wanna talk about it.

1:08:42.382 --> 1:08:45.117
You don't get to do this, Henry.

1:08:45.150 --> 1:08:48.655
Um, I can't... talk.

1:08:49.221 --> 1:08:50.690
Um...

1:08:53.626 --> 1:08:54.927
How long
has this been going on?

1:08:54.960 --> 1:08:57.162
I just can't talk right now,
honey.

1:08:57.196 --> 1:08:59.965
- What?
- It's the first time.

1:08:59.998 --> 1:09:02.635
- It's the first time. It's...
- What?

1:09:03.436 --> 1:09:06.339
Uh...

1:09:06.373 --> 1:09:07.640
It's just morphine.

1:09:07.674 --> 1:09:09.476
It's just a little bit
of morphine.

1:09:09.509 --> 1:09:11.043
It's alright.

1:09:41.974 --> 1:09:43.543
It's okay.

1:09:47.747 --> 1:09:50.784
We're losing her, aren't we?

1:09:52.285 --> 1:09:56.289
We're losing her.
What the fuck are we gonna do?

1:10:01.093 --> 1:10:03.061
What are we gonna do?

1:10:08.967 --> 1:10:10.770
Moses!

1:10:10.804 --> 1:10:13.873
Moses, I just wanna talk.

1:10:13.907 --> 1:10:15.642
No, no. I just...
I just wanna talk.

1:10:15.675 --> 1:10:17.510
- Whoa! Whoa!
- I just wanna...

1:10:17.544 --> 1:10:20.045
I said I just want...

1:10:20.780 --> 1:10:23.048
Henry! Henry! Henry.

1:10:23.949 --> 1:10:27.253
Is... Is she dead? Is she dead?

1:10:27.287 --> 1:10:29.154
- No.
- Is she de...

1:10:32.392 --> 1:10:33.560
Oh!

1:10:39.198 --> 1:10:40.900
What were you doing?

1:10:40.934 --> 1:10:43.369
What are you doing leaving there
in the middle of the night?

1:10:43.403 --> 1:10:44.637
What kind of...

1:10:44.671 --> 1:10:47.574
What kind of fucking person
are you?

1:10:49.074 --> 1:10:50.877
And I came back.

1:10:52.345 --> 1:10:54.314
I did. I came back for her.

1:10:54.347 --> 1:10:56.215
It all just got fucked.

1:10:58.518 --> 1:11:00.420
Will you come and stay with us?

1:11:00.453 --> 1:11:02.922
I can get you what you need.

1:11:03.890 --> 1:11:05.190
What?

1:11:07.627 --> 1:11:09.562
I don't like you.

1:11:10.996 --> 1:11:14.132
But Milla thinks
you're something special.

1:11:14.166 --> 1:11:17.202
She should have the world
at her feet right now.

1:11:20.573 --> 1:11:23.041
I can write you prescriptions.

1:11:25.645 --> 1:11:27.814
Come and stay with us.

1:11:36.856 --> 1:11:37.924
Ow.

1:11:43.530 --> 1:11:45.698
Who did this to you?

1:11:45.732 --> 1:11:48.935
- It was your dad mostly.
- No, who did it?

1:11:53.873 --> 1:11:57.042
What? What the fuck... Oh!

1:11:58.478 --> 1:12:00.112
It was you!

1:12:02.382 --> 1:12:04.116
No. Just some dickheads.

1:12:05.985 --> 1:12:08.721
- And your dad.
- No.

1:12:15.160 --> 1:12:18.565
Do you want another beer, Henry?
Oh, you're on wine.

1:12:18.598 --> 1:12:21.401
- Anna?
- No, thanks.

1:12:21.434 --> 1:12:23.002
I love those chrysanthemums.

1:12:23.036 --> 1:12:25.038
They're just like
such an explosion, aren't they?

1:12:25.070 --> 1:12:28.641
- Hm, they're dahlias, actually.
- I love that color.

1:12:28.675 --> 1:12:30.810
It's so deep... Excuse me.

1:12:30.843 --> 1:12:33.111
It's so deep in the middle.

1:12:35.281 --> 1:12:37.951
Dad! No! That was with food
falling out of my mouth!

1:12:37.984 --> 1:12:41.554
- Well, take another one, Henry.
- First, let me finish.

1:12:42.422 --> 1:12:43.923
- Okay.
- Ready?

1:12:43.957 --> 1:12:45.157
Mm-hm.

1:12:46.059 --> 1:12:47.226
Oh, that's nice.

1:12:47.260 --> 1:12:49.829
Oh, that's very cute.
Hold on. There we go.

1:12:49.862 --> 1:12:51.230
- How's that?
- Milla, give me a look...

1:12:51.264 --> 1:12:52.765
Get your...
Oh, no, that'll do it.

1:12:52.799 --> 1:12:56.069
- Okay. Okay.
- Alright. Alright. Just...

1:12:56.101 --> 1:12:57.737
I'll get some more dahlias
tomorrow.

1:12:57.770 --> 1:13:00.138
Oh, no, I think
we're okay for flowers.

1:13:00.172 --> 1:13:02.207
Oh, you have to just go for it
with dahlias.

1:13:02.241 --> 1:13:04.010
The... the... the season
is so short.

1:13:04.043 --> 1:13:05.612
- I know.
- Uh, like, uh...

1:13:05.645 --> 1:13:07.013
It's like horse mushroom season.

1:13:07.046 --> 1:13:08.815
My dad used to say
that horse mushroom season

1:13:08.848 --> 1:13:11.918
was, like, the best time
of the year.

1:13:11.951 --> 1:13:14.119
It'd be good to meet your dad
sometime, Moses.

1:13:14.152 --> 1:13:15.655
He'd love that!

1:13:17.390 --> 1:13:20.093
- Uh, outside.
- Oh.

1:13:24.998 --> 1:13:27.300
- When's horse mushroom season?
- Huh?

1:13:27.333 --> 1:13:29.869
No idea, darling. No idea.

1:13:30.637 --> 1:13:32.071
Stop!

1:13:47.587 --> 1:13:48.921
Anna?

1:13:51.156 --> 1:13:54.661
I thought I heard something?
Did you?

1:13:58.297 --> 1:14:00.066
No.

1:14:00.099 --> 1:14:02.802
It must have been
my imagination.

1:14:05.304 --> 1:14:09.207
Anna? Hey, what detergent
do you use?

1:14:10.843 --> 1:14:13.613
Are you sleep talking?

1:14:13.646 --> 1:14:14.947
No.

1:14:14.981 --> 1:14:18.885
These sheets smell so good.

1:14:22.922 --> 1:14:24.991
I forgot what it's called.

1:14:25.024 --> 1:14:27.126
Do you wanna know now?

1:14:28.961 --> 1:14:30.730
It can wait till morning.

1:14:32.165 --> 1:14:33.366
Moses...

1:14:34.767 --> 1:14:37.202
...does your mother know
where you are?

1:14:44.343 --> 1:14:45.411
No.

1:14:48.481 --> 1:14:50.783
Don't you think she'd like to?

1:14:53.920 --> 1:14:56.823
Milla said she used to sleep
under the piano.

1:14:56.856 --> 1:15:00.159
Yeah. She did.

1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:04.397
She liked the feeling
of the vibrations.

1:15:04.430 --> 1:15:09.068
She used to just... curl up
underneath.

1:15:09.102 --> 1:15:11.437
Like this.

1:15:12.672 --> 1:15:14.941
And wrap her whole body
around it.

1:15:30.790 --> 1:15:33.493
You get some sleep.

1:15:51.711 --> 1:15:55.114
- Milla?
- Mm?

1:15:55.148 --> 1:15:58.885
- Can I sleep with you?
- Mm-hm.

1:16:28.248 --> 1:16:30.516
Ah! Fuck it!

1:16:30.550 --> 1:16:31.984
It was good, Mo.

1:16:33.319 --> 1:16:36.923
He just needs to let go
of some of the tension in his...

1:16:38.791 --> 1:16:41.127
He's just a perfectionist.

1:16:48.968 --> 1:16:52.038
- Mum, play with me?
- I-I don't know. I...

1:16:52.071 --> 1:16:53.940
<i>We can play the "Le Cygne."</i>

1:16:55.408 --> 1:16:58.477
- I think you should rest.
- Mum, what do you wanna play?

1:17:01.447 --> 1:17:04.450
I just... I just I want you
to get better.

1:17:11.190 --> 1:17:13.359
I'm going out for a bit.

1:17:14.228 --> 1:17:17.463
Can you keep your eye on them?

1:17:17.496 --> 1:17:18.631
Yeah.

1:17:26.372 --> 1:17:30.042
This is the worst possible
parenting I can imagine.

1:17:34.647 --> 1:17:35.848
Okay.

1:18:22.628 --> 1:18:23.930
Hi.

1:18:23.963 --> 1:18:26.465
Can you put these
in water for me?

1:18:29.468 --> 1:18:31.305
Mill?

1:18:31.338 --> 1:18:33.273
Do you still wanna take him
to your formal?

1:18:34.707 --> 1:18:36.075
Do you want to?

1:18:47.954 --> 1:18:49.855
- Try it on.
- Oh, my God.

1:18:49.889 --> 1:18:52.158
Try it on. Try it on.
Try it on.

1:19:31.831 --> 1:19:33.799
<i>How is it?</i>

1:19:33.833 --> 1:19:35.302
It's perfect.

1:19:40.506 --> 1:19:41.941
Turn around.

1:19:53.320 --> 1:19:55.654
You look so beautiful.

1:19:57.324 --> 1:19:58.691
Maybe we could just put
a dart...

1:19:58.724 --> 1:20:01.594
I just wanna show Mo first.

1:20:04.030 --> 1:20:05.664
I love it, mum.

1:20:09.236 --> 1:20:11.438
You are my dream girl.

1:20:11.471 --> 1:20:14.274
Mo, I just found this thing
under my arm.

1:20:17.576 --> 1:20:20.546
- What sort of thing?
- A lump.

1:20:22.315 --> 1:20:24.717
Do you know what it means?

1:20:24.750 --> 1:20:26.286
Really, um...

1:20:27.421 --> 1:20:31.023
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothin'.

1:20:31.057 --> 1:20:32.558
<i>Are you stoned?</i>

1:20:33.726 --> 1:20:35.395
Henry sorted me out.

1:20:42.735 --> 1:20:44.471
- Henry!
- But it's cool.

1:20:44.504 --> 1:20:46.072
- Henry!
- What is it? What's he...

1:20:46.105 --> 1:20:47.907
- You've been drugging him, dad?
- Oh...

1:20:47.940 --> 1:20:50.343
- Well, it's nothing illicit.
- What? To keep him here?

1:20:50.377 --> 1:20:51.811
- <i>No.</i>
- No. It just...

1:20:51.844 --> 1:20:53.480
<i>It's pres...
Just, just prescrip...</i>

1:20:53.513 --> 1:20:55.181
Prescribed by you, dad! You've...

1:20:55.214 --> 1:20:56.816
You've made him
into some kind of hooker.

1:20:56.849 --> 1:21:00.186
- Well, sex isn't part of it.
- Did you know?

1:21:02.121 --> 1:21:03.557
You'd given up
on everything else.

1:21:03.589 --> 1:21:05.991
You think I can't take the fact
he doesn't love me back?

1:21:06.025 --> 1:21:07.461
You can't treat people
like that.

1:21:07.494 --> 1:21:09.795
Yeah, but Mill, it worked.

1:21:09.829 --> 1:21:12.332
You're so stupid!

1:21:12.365 --> 1:21:15.535
You... you think you can fix
things by handing out drugs.

1:21:15.569 --> 1:21:17.437
I mean, my God.
I have no idea who she is.

1:21:17.471 --> 1:21:19.872
You keep her so fucking high.

1:21:19.905 --> 1:21:21.508
I'm off everything actually.

1:21:21.541 --> 1:21:24.311
Except I had a half
a sleeping tablet last night.

1:21:24.344 --> 1:21:26.846
You think you can fix things
by paying off some junkie?

1:21:26.879 --> 1:21:29.081
You think that's what I need
from my dad?

1:21:29.115 --> 1:21:31.050
Oh, Mill,
it's not what this was.

1:21:31.083 --> 1:21:32.818
Mill, I'm not here
'cause of the drugs.

1:21:32.852 --> 1:21:35.355
- They're shit anyway.
- Why are you here?

1:21:35.388 --> 1:21:36.822
I care about you.

1:21:37.723 --> 1:21:38.724
<i>You're lying.</i>

1:21:40.260 --> 1:21:42.229
<i>You're always
a million miles away going</i>

1:21:42.262 --> 1:21:43.629
<i>"What can I get
out of this person..."</i>

1:21:43.662 --> 1:21:44.864
You're just being nasty.

1:21:44.897 --> 1:21:46.198
When I met you it was like...

1:21:46.233 --> 1:21:48.634
I can't believe it,
it was like...

1:21:48.667 --> 1:21:50.803
...you weren't scared
of anything.

1:21:50.836 --> 1:21:52.905
<i>But it's because
you don't give a shit.</i>

1:21:52.938 --> 1:21:55.475
<i>I mean, all that crap
about horse mushroom season!</i>

1:21:55.509 --> 1:21:59.312
Do you even know? Do you
even know who your father is?

1:21:59.346 --> 1:22:02.081
Fuck you.
You're so fucking perfect.

1:22:02.114 --> 1:22:03.550
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

1:22:03.583 --> 1:22:07.387
- You think you're so perfect?
- <i>No, I don't.</i>

1:22:07.420 --> 1:22:10.022
You lie all the time.

1:22:10.055 --> 1:22:11.790
<i>You wanna tell them?</i>

1:22:14.193 --> 1:22:17.430
- What?
- She's got a lump.

1:22:17.464 --> 1:22:18.831
What?

1:22:18.864 --> 1:22:20.400
She's got a lump.

1:22:24.538 --> 1:22:26.573
Milla?

1:22:26.606 --> 1:22:28.140
Is that true?

1:22:32.312 --> 1:22:35.981
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out.

1:22:36.015 --> 1:22:38.150
Go!

1:22:38.184 --> 1:22:40.953
Stop wasting my time!

1:24:12.878 --> 1:24:14.648
Hey, Zachy.

1:24:17.684 --> 1:24:20.654
Hey, come and open the door.

1:24:26.025 --> 1:24:27.460
Well, come on.

1:24:36.436 --> 1:24:38.471
Isaac! Come on!

1:24:41.274 --> 1:24:43.510
Hey, I just wanna see you!

1:24:43.543 --> 1:24:45.944
I thought you were my mate!

1:24:57.357 --> 1:24:58.792
You can't keep doing this,
Moses.

1:25:26.820 --> 1:25:28.254
Milla...

1:25:29.823 --> 1:25:31.591
...if you die I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

1:25:31.624 --> 1:25:34.761
- I'm going to scream.
- Can you just hear me out?

1:25:37.297 --> 1:25:39.566
I never went camping
with my dad.

1:25:45.037 --> 1:25:48.408
I stayed with him one time,
one Christmas

1:25:48.441 --> 1:25:51.043
and he hardly even talked to me.

1:25:57.082 --> 1:25:58.951
He was working in this
restaurant where he was fucking

1:25:58.984 --> 1:26:01.688
the manager in his car
every night

1:26:01.721 --> 1:26:05.023
and I had to wait in the carpark
until he was finished.

1:26:09.194 --> 1:26:11.531
I never told mum.

1:26:11.564 --> 1:26:14.834
I told her that we slept
in treehouses and shot birds.

1:26:20.707 --> 1:26:24.577
I want to be with you... Milla.

1:26:27.280 --> 1:26:29.682
I don't know how to do this.

1:26:47.267 --> 1:26:49.001
I win.

1:26:50.102 --> 1:26:51.471
Oh!

1:26:54.006 --> 1:26:55.642
Did you cheat?

1:26:58.912 --> 1:27:00.447
Yeah.

1:27:05.083 --> 1:27:06.820
Do you wanna eat that?

1:27:48.394 --> 1:27:51.931
Can we just do one more,
until I win one?

Hey, Mo.

1:30:05.098 --> 1:30:07.100
I've heard that you're
a really good dancer.

1:30:07.132 --> 1:30:08.166

You were really good.
S... so I told her.

- For my birthday.
- Don't pull that card!

- That was excellent.
- Mum?

Do you... Do you have a car?

1:33:35.007 --> 1:33:37.176
- Of course.
- Okay. Shh.

1:33:53.092 --> 1:33:56.296

I don't think I can take
another morning, Mo.

1:35:06.032 --> 1:35:08.968
- Do you want some morphine?
- No.

1:35:15.342 --> 1:35:17.344
Will you do something for me?

1:35:18.744 --> 1:35:20.579
You know I will.

1:35:24.083 --> 1:35:26.852
Will you take this pillow...

1:35:26.886 --> 1:35:29.455
...and just hold it
over my face?

1:35:37.596 --> 1:35:39.465
If my body starts to tense
or it looks like

1:35:39.498 --> 1:35:43.202
I've changed my mind,
just push harder.

1:35:43.236 --> 1:35:45.272
That's just what bodies do,
something in it fights

1:35:45.305 --> 1:35:47.039
but it's not me.

1:35:50.109 --> 1:35:52.312
Hey, I'm not gonna do this.

1:35:53.145 --> 1:35:55.282
Don't leave it unfinished.

1:35:56.816 --> 1:35:59.852
Wait until my hips drop open
and there's no hold in my spine.

1:35:59.885 --> 1:36:02.255
Then you can take
the pillow away.

1:36:05.292 --> 1:36:06.892
Hey, if you want
to kill yourself

1:36:06.926 --> 1:36:09.495
get your dad to give you
too much morphine.

1:36:12.466 --> 1:36:14.200
It would kill dad.

1:36:15.201 --> 1:36:17.437
This way I just stop breathing.

1:36:21.607 --> 1:36:23.343
No. Fuck no.

1:36:27.314 --> 1:36:29.648
I know what happens from here.

1:36:32.184 --> 1:36:34.321
This body, it's too much.

1:36:36.989 --> 1:36:40.360
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

1:36:40.394 --> 1:36:44.231
And it just...
It gets more painful, Mo.

1:36:58.245 --> 1:37:00.247
Please don't ask me to do this.

1:37:00.280 --> 1:37:01.515
Please.

1:37:02.948 --> 1:37:05.184
I need you to help me.

1:37:28.908 --> 1:37:31.210
- Can I have a sip?
- Yeah.

1:38:08.180 --> 1:38:10.216
I'm sorry, Mo.

1:38:16.856 --> 1:38:19.259
I know you love me too.

1:38:22.728 --> 1:38:24.730
Not any more, I don't.

1:38:30.836 --> 1:38:33.573
<i>Don't stop pushing.</i>

1:38:33.607 --> 1:38:36.510
Your body has to bear me down.
Okay?

1:39:58.924 --> 1:40:00.327
Ow.

1:40:02.027 --> 1:40:03.396
You okay?

1:40:52.412 --> 1:40:55.548
[breathing heavily[

1:42:35.515 --> 1:42:37.650
You birds are crazy.

1:43:08.448 --> 1:43:11.451
- Should I make crepes?
- No.

1:43:11.484 --> 1:43:13.686
Don't you like my crepes?

1:43:13.720 --> 1:43:18.858
No, they're fine. They're
just always such a big deal.

1:43:18.892 --> 1:43:21.895
Well, I don't make them
as punishment.

1:43:23.596 --> 1:43:26.499
Oh, this cake is disgusting.

1:43:36.643 --> 1:43:38.611
Do you think they're having sex?

1:43:38.645 --> 1:43:40.045
I do.

1:43:40.078 --> 1:43:42.014
Did you hear something?

1:43:51.056 --> 1:43:52.525
Oh...

1:44:00.667 --> 1:44:02.535
Can you just knock on the door
and give her this?

1:44:02.569 --> 1:44:05.338
- No!
- Come on. Just...

1:44:05.371 --> 1:44:06.506
Henry, come on...

1:44:06.539 --> 1:44:07.540
- No.
- Just...

1:44:07.574 --> 1:44:09.776
Just give the door a little tap.

1:44:12.312 --> 1:44:13.480
Okay.

1:44:17.584 --> 1:44:20.320
- Good morning, sleepyhead.
- <i>Good morning.</i>

1:44:20.353 --> 1:44:23.088
<i>Is Milla awake?</i>

1:44:23.121 --> 1:44:25.658
I didn't hear her in the night.
Did she sleep through?

1:44:25.692 --> 1:44:29.362
<i>She, uh, woke up at about 4:00.</i>

1:44:29.395 --> 1:44:31.997
<i>And then she went to the,
went to the toilet.</i>

1:44:34.199 --> 1:44:36.302
<i>She didn't need her morphine?</i>

1:44:36.336 --> 1:44:38.805
- No.
- <i>That's great.</i>

1:44:38.838 --> 1:44:41.975
That's like the first time
in about six weeks?

1:44:42.007 --> 1:44:44.577
That's, that's great.

1:44:44.611 --> 1:44:47.480
I was going to make you a tray
to have in bed.

1:44:47.514 --> 1:44:49.282
Just gonna finish my cigarette.

1:44:49.315 --> 1:44:52.886
<i>Oh. I thought you could
eat together. Doesn't matter.</i>

1:44:52.919 --> 1:44:56.589
She's got to get up and eat
something in a moment anyway.

1:45:27.219 --> 1:45:28.855
She was dead already.

1:45:30.590 --> 1:45:34.561
You come in here and you...

1:45:34.594 --> 1:45:38.698
And I woke up and she was,
she was already dead.

1:45:38.731 --> 1:45:41.467
She looked peaceful.

1:45:41.501 --> 1:45:43.570
Not now she doesn't.

1:45:43.603 --> 1:45:45.038
She doesn't look so peaceful now

1:45:45.070 --> 1:45:46.873
with her eyes rolled back
like that.

1:45:46.906 --> 1:45:49.976
- I closed them.
- Well, they opened!

1:45:50.009 --> 1:45:53.479
Why didn't you call me?
Why didn't you tell me?

1:45:53.513 --> 1:45:55.213
We could have... We could have...

1:45:55.248 --> 1:45:57.784
We could have...
We could have resuscitated her.

1:45:57.817 --> 1:46:00.687
She might... She might...
maybe she...

1:46:00.720 --> 1:46:03.756
She was dead.
She was already dead.

1:46:03.790 --> 1:46:08.126
Will you stop smoking
in my house, you fuck!

1:46:08.160 --> 1:46:10.095
You fuck!

1:46:14.467 --> 1:46:16.402
I didn't get to say goodbye.

1:46:24.344 --> 1:46:27.212
She didn't say goodbye to me.

1:46:34.754 --> 1:46:39.124
<i>You come in here
and you smoke us out.</i>

1:46:39.157 --> 1:46:40.627
You!

1:46:40.660 --> 1:46:42.528
You're the one
who got to hold her

1:46:42.562 --> 1:46:45.565
you're the one
who got to have her last breath.

1:46:45.598 --> 1:46:49.535
And you use it...
And you use it all up!

1:47:06.886 --> 1:47:09.122
<i>I didn't say goodbye.</i>

1:47:31.944 --> 1:47:35.081
<i>I didn't say goodbye.</i>

1:47:52.699 --> 1:47:56.235
<i>Alright, hey,
are you guys ready?</i>

1:47:56.269 --> 1:47:57.270
<i>Ready?</i>

1:47:59.739 --> 1:48:02.875
<i>Ah, ready?</i>

1:48:05.778 --> 1:48:08.181
<i>One, two...</i>

1:48:11.517 --> 1:48:12.919
Sorry.

1:48:12.952 --> 1:48:14.687
- What did you do?
- Sorry.

1:48:14.721 --> 1:48:16.723
I accidentally went like this.

1:48:19.926 --> 1:48:21.661
<i>Okay, you ready?</i>

1:48:21.694 --> 1:48:24.163
Isaac!
Isaac, come and be in the photo.

1:48:29.936 --> 1:48:31.003
Sit in the middle.
Middle.

1:48:31.037 --> 1:48:32.739
- Middle.
- Oh, Jesus.

1:48:32.772 --> 1:48:34.574
Seriously, mum's got a bit of
hypervigilance

1:48:34.607 --> 1:48:36.008
about the beach, mate.

1:48:36.042 --> 1:48:37.009
Go.

1:48:37.643 --> 1:48:39.011
<i>You all ready?</i>

1:48:41.514 --> 1:48:43.883
Got it. Got it.

1:48:45.485 --> 1:48:47.987
Come here, mate.

1:48:48.020 --> 1:48:49.255
- No.
- You're coming with me!

1:48:49.288 --> 1:48:51.224
What're you doing?
What're you doing?

1:48:53.760 --> 1:48:54.861
- How is it?
- No, no, no. Stop.

1:48:54.894 --> 1:48:56.362
Stop, stop, stop.

1:48:57.530 --> 1:48:59.198
Here we go. Oh, my God!

1:49:27.026 --> 1:49:30.897
Oh, yeah, I got this idea.
Okay. Okay.

1:49:30.930 --> 1:49:33.399
This is good. Mill? You ready?

1:49:35.468 --> 1:49:37.403
I'm tired, Henry.

1:49:42.608 --> 1:49:45.444
Darling, I know,
but, but you can just...

1:49:45.478 --> 1:49:46.612
<i>Dad.</i>

1:49:47.814 --> 1:49:49.649
I'm tired.

1:49:57.757 --> 1:49:59.325
You know we'll be okay.

1:50:06.866 --> 1:50:08.302
I'll take your photo.

1:50:10.736 --> 1:50:12.338
- No, no...
- Go.

1:50:12.371 --> 1:50:14.006
- Go and stand over there.
- No, dear, it's okay.

1:50:14.040 --> 1:50:16.175
- I want to do it.
- Alright.

1:50:16.209 --> 1:50:19.045
<i>Well, do you know
that t... to do the focus</i>

1:50:19.078 --> 1:50:22.615
<i>you do, the, um, the outside
wheel and for the finer points</i>

1:50:22.648 --> 1:50:26.552
<i>that will be the fine focus,
and then obviously that's the shutter.</i>

1:50:26.586 --> 1:50:28.588
I know how to use it, dad.

1:50:28.621 --> 1:50:31.123
Yeah, okay. But just y... you
might want to wait 'til...

1:50:31.157 --> 1:50:33.125
Will you look after Moses, dad?

1:50:35.528 --> 1:50:36.762
Yeah.

1:50:43.369 --> 1:50:45.004
Are you going to smile?

1:50:45.037 --> 1:50:47.440
Um, just give me a minute.

1:51:11.097 --> 1:51:14.467
I'm going to enjoy becoming
part of a sky like this, dad.

1:51:24.378 --> 1:51:26.846
Hey? You okay?

1:51:33.753 --> 1:51:35.221
Are you ready?

1:51:37.490 --> 1:51:38.791
Yep.

1:51:39.825 --> 1:51:41.060
Yep.

1:51:42.929 --> 1:51:47.066
One, two, three.
