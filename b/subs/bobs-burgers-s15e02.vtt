[bob] I still can't believe
the cosmic drive-in's closing.

00:23.441 --> 00:24.898
Aw, poor drive-in.

00:24.984 --> 00:26.650
But I'm glad you kids will get
to see it before it's gone.

00:26.736 --> 00:29.236
Always interested in your
disappearing way of life, dad.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.530
-Tell us again
about print media?
-Louise.

00:31.657 --> 00:33.741
I used to go there
all the time when I was a kid.

00:33.868 --> 00:35.117
Or, well, a few times.

00:35.244 --> 00:37.244
And you met ramona.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.620
Who's ramona?

00:38.748 --> 00:41.165
She was the first girl
that ever talked to your dad.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.541
-Pretty much, yeah.
-Aw.

00:42.585 --> 00:44.376
Mom was the first girl
that ever talked to me.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.211
-I felt so special.
-[phone chimes]

00:46.297 --> 00:47.838
Ugh. This lady from the pta.

00:47.965 --> 00:49.381
I texted her on our group chat.

00:49.467 --> 00:50.716
I said, "are you bringing
four tables

00:50.801 --> 00:52.259
Or five tables
to the bake sale?"

00:52.344 --> 00:54.094
-And she texts back, "got it."
-huh.

00:54.180 --> 00:55.721
And then colleen
writes back, "which is it?"

00:55.806 --> 00:58.348
And then, an hour later
maryanne finally texts back,

00:58.476 --> 00:59.641
"how many tables
for the bake sale?"

00:59.727 --> 01:01.143
And I say, "we need five total.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.936
Can you bring five, or do we
need to find another table?"

01:03.022 --> 01:05.105
And she just wrote back,
"see you then."

01:05.191 --> 01:06.565
And you're confused because...

01:06.734 --> 01:08.192
Maybe you should just call her?

01:08.277 --> 01:10.069
And what, talk to her?
No, thanks.

01:10.196 --> 01:12.321
I'll just complain about her
on our other text chain

01:12.490 --> 01:13.405
Where a few of us vent about

01:13.532 --> 01:14.907
Maryanne's weird,
confusing texts.

01:14.992 --> 01:17.367
So you're talking about her
behind her back.

01:17.453 --> 01:20.496
No, I'm texting about her
behind her back.

01:20.623 --> 01:21.830
-Got it.
-Well, I'm so glad

01:21.957 --> 01:23.248
Teddy told us
about tonight, or else

01:23.375 --> 01:24.833
We would've missed
the final screening.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.376
What's the movie
we're seeing again?

01:26.504 --> 01:27.711
<i> Attack of the man-monsters.</i>

01:27.797 --> 01:29.713
It's a great movie
from the '60s.

01:29.799 --> 01:31.340
Well, it's a movie
from the '60s.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.509
This drive-in
likes to play old movies.

01:33.594 --> 01:34.885
So glad it's an old movie

01:34.970 --> 01:36.595
And not one of those
boring new movies.

01:36.722 --> 01:37.971
Please tell me it's slow-paced.

01:38.057 --> 01:40.140
Oh, come on, kids,
we're gonna be

01:40.184 --> 01:41.391
Watching a movie

in all the food you want.

And the almost-fancy crackers,

01:48.567 --> 01:51.443
Half a bag of croutons,
and some old deli meat

01:51.612 --> 01:52.611
That's probably still good.

Uh-huh. Thank god tina's sharing

01:54.156 --> 01:56.490

was the other text chain,

Oh, this is bad.
This is very bad.

something better?

Whoa. Someone's full
of beans tonight.

I am full of beans, tina.

about it.

You're gonna do something
about something?

05:50.934 --> 05:52.559
-That's not your style.
-I know.

to save the drive-in?

-Like give it a kidney?

like get a-a petition going?

technical difficulty, folks.

We'll get this projector up and
running in just a few moments.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.182
In the meantime,
enjoy some popcorn.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.226
Uh, okay, now I'm hearing

06:34.311 --> 06:36.436
That popcorn is unavailable
at the moment.

06:36.522 --> 06:38.563
The machine
is a little bit on fire.

06:38.649 --> 06:41.525
But there's lots of other
tasty not-on-fire treats,

06:41.610 --> 06:42.692
So come on down.

06:42.778 --> 06:44.694
Still worth saving.

Uh, o-okay,
we don't have any paper,

06:50.494 --> 06:52.869
But, uh, people can just
sign these napkins?

06:52.996 --> 06:54.496
You can use napkins
for a petition, right?

06:54.581 --> 06:56.915
-Unless you're a petition snob.
-Ah, crap.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.792
I told the main text chain
that me calling maryanne

06:58.877 --> 07:01.294
A dumb-belstiltskin was just
some sort of autocorrect thing,

07:01.380 --> 07:03.088
But now they've gone silent.

07:03.173 --> 07:04.756
-And my other text chain--
-the gossipy one.

07:04.842 --> 07:07.426
Shush. They're all freaking out,
and it's not helping.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.052
Maybe I tell the main one
I was hacked?

07:09.179 --> 07:12.097
I'm sorry, lin. D-do you want me
to stay and help you

07:12.224 --> 07:15.934
-Lie to people on the pta?
-No, I'll figure it out.

07:16.019 --> 07:19.146
Okay, I'm gonna go get
petitioning to save this place.

-Good luck, dad.

07:20.816 --> 07:22.315
Ooh, I'm feeling a pee
coming on.

Better go take care of that
before the movie.

okay, bye.

a little smidge of sugar

-While tina's away?
-But she said to wait.

-Come on, she'll never know.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.758
Your mouth is really blue.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.719
Oh, crap.
I forgot ka-bloozies did that.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.929
We were caught up
in the moment of candy bliss.

07:53.015 --> 07:54.931
Oh, man, tina's gonna be
so mad at us.

07:55.017 --> 07:57.017
The candy queen's
gonna chop off our heads.

07:57.102 --> 08:00.520
Or worse, never let us have
any of her candy ever again.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.355
Gah! Maybe we can
wash out our mouths.

08:02.441 --> 08:04.774
Yes. Mom, did you bring water,
by any chance?

08:04.902 --> 08:06.443
We won't make fun of you
if you did.

08:06.570 --> 08:08.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh-huh.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.114
[grunting]

08:11.241 --> 08:12.657
How's it look now? Ah?

08:12.743 --> 08:14.534
Still very blue. Me? Ah.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.703
-Somehow more blue?
-Napkins.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.413
[car door opens, closes]

08:18.499 --> 08:19.956
[both grunting]

08:20.042 --> 08:22.626
Now I got bits of napkin
in my mouth.

08:22.711 --> 08:25.837
Daddy, there's a scary man
outside our window.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.297
Um, yes?

08:27.466 --> 08:29.341
I'm, uh, I'm not scary.
I was just wondering

08:29.426 --> 08:31.551
If you'd sign this petition
to save the drive-in.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.053
-That's a napkin.
-I know.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.679
It was, it was sort of
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

08:34.765 --> 08:37.307
But it's a real petition.
Gonna be a real petition.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.351
-Anyway,
if you could just sign--
-don't do it, dad.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.311
-He's a murderer.
-Hey, I-I'm not a...

08:41.396 --> 08:43.813
-I'm not a murderer.
-That's what a murderer
would say.

08:43.899 --> 08:45.357
Honey, the kids are scared.

08:45.484 --> 08:46.775
I think you better
just roll up the window.

08:46.902 --> 08:48.235
-Sorry.
-Hurry, dad, hurry!

08:48.362 --> 08:50.278
-Yeah, sorry.
-I, uh...

08:50.364 --> 08:52.614
It's a petition
for saving the drive-in.

08:52.783 --> 08:54.991
-The projector's broken.
-Yes, uh, I-I know, but--

08:55.118 --> 08:56.660
And the sign
doesn't even work anymore.

08:56.787 --> 08:57.953
I drove right by the entrance,

08:58.080 --> 09:00.080
-Had to turn around.
-Uh, r-right.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.457
And I didn't really care
for the last film I saw here.

09:02.584 --> 09:04.709
Well, I don't think
that's really their fault.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.253
-Here. Goodbye.
-[muffled fart]

09:06.338 --> 09:08.255
Uh, that was me. Sneezing.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.382
-Um...
-Okay, off you go.

09:10.467 --> 09:11.925
Bye-bye now.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.969
[grunting]

09:14.096 --> 09:15.512
[both grunting]

09:15.597 --> 09:16.930
Oh, god. Here comes tina,

09:17.015 --> 09:18.723
And our mouths
are still very blue.

09:18.809 --> 09:20.767
[gene]
maybe she doesn't even
like ka-bloozies

09:20.852 --> 09:22.811
And we actually did her a favor?

09:22.896 --> 09:24.521
No matter what,
don't open your mouth.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.606
Okay, now that that's
out of my system. [chuckles]

09:26.692 --> 09:27.899
[gene and louise giggle]

09:28.068 --> 09:29.609
Yeah, that was a good one.
All right, guys?

09:29.695 --> 09:31.403
Since we've got some time,
I thought we could go over

09:31.488 --> 09:33.029
The candy ground rules.
Sound good?

09:33.115 --> 09:34.239
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.283
Okay, so,
no fighting over candies,

09:36.368 --> 09:37.784
No overstuffing mouthies,

09:37.911 --> 09:39.953
And no "taste it, don't like it,
put it back in the bagsies."

09:40.080 --> 09:41.204
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

09:41.290 --> 09:42.414
Oh, and stay away
from the ka-bloozies.

09:42.541 --> 09:43.957
-Hmm?
-Yeah, those are for tina.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.042
There's three of them,
and I'm saving them

09:46.169 --> 09:48.211
For my big candy finale
near the end of the movie.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.463
So, ka-bloozies,
not-for-youzies.

09:50.591 --> 09:51.548
Everybody clear on that?

09:51.633 --> 09:53.133
-[both] mm...
-Great.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.844
Okay, I've been brainstorming
with the non-maryanne text chain

09:55.929 --> 09:57.804
And we came up
with the perfect plan.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.598
I'm gonna call one of them
the same thing

09:59.683 --> 10:01.516
I called maryanne
and then take a screenshot

10:01.560 --> 10:03.393
And text it to maryanne
as evidence

10:03.478 --> 10:05.520
That dumb-belstiltskin is just
something I call everyone.

10:05.606 --> 10:06.605
Isn't that smart?

10:06.732 --> 10:08.064
-I mean--
-it is.

10:08.150 --> 10:09.566
[maryanne] [over phone]
<i> linda? Hello?</i>

10:09.651 --> 10:11.192
<i> Did you mean to call me?</i>

10:11.320 --> 10:13.111
<i> -It's maryanne.</i>
-Oh! Oh!

10:13.196 --> 10:14.654
Hang up! Hang up!

10:14.740 --> 10:16.823
What you up to?
Bothering people?

10:16.908 --> 10:19.492
Just trying to do
a petition thing

10:19.620 --> 10:20.535
To save the drive-in.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.579
Oh, wow. You want some popcorn?

10:22.664 --> 10:24.706
It's burnt but free?

10:24.833 --> 10:26.041
Uh, okay.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.127
[ramona]
you think<i> the fly</i>
is about communism?

10:29.212 --> 10:32.839
Yeah, I think all movies from
the '50s were about communism.

10:32.924 --> 10:35.008
I think it's about
not messing with nature.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.384
But also maybe it's about, like,

10:36.511 --> 10:38.511
The part of you
that's weird, like a fly.

10:38.597 --> 10:41.264
-Your idea sounds smarter.
-I'm very smart.

10:41.391 --> 10:42.766
Hey, you want to see
something cool?

10:42.851 --> 10:44.601
Uh, intermission's almost over.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.895
This is worth it, trust me.
You okay with heights?

10:47.064 --> 10:48.813
-Oh. Uh...
-Forget I said heights.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.649
I meant great things.
You okay with great things?

10:50.734 --> 10:52.275
-Yes?
-Good.

10:52.361 --> 10:56.071
How'd you like to watch the rest
of the movie from up there?

10:57.658 --> 10:59.407
[quinn]
huh. I want to save
the drive-in, too,

10:59.493 --> 11:01.284
But I never thought of
actually doing something.

11:01.370 --> 11:04.454
I know. Me either.
I never do things.

11:04.623 --> 11:06.122
So, what happens after
you get all the signatures?

11:06.208 --> 11:09.042
Uh, well, I'll present them
to evelyn and say,

11:09.169 --> 11:10.585
"look at all these names."

11:10.712 --> 11:12.837
I-I'm-I'm kind of bad at this.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.381
What you should really do
is something online,

11:14.508 --> 11:16.049
Where people can kick in
a few bucks?

11:16.176 --> 11:17.592
This place needs money.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.135
Oh. Yeah. That sounds great.

11:19.262 --> 11:21.012
Uh, how do people do that?

11:21.098 --> 11:22.931
Well, there's lots of sites
you can use.

11:23.016 --> 11:23.932
You go on one, sign up,

11:24.101 --> 11:26.184
Get yourself a link
people can go to.

11:26.269 --> 11:27.811
My cousin used moneyprettyplease

11:27.896 --> 11:29.479
To help pay for
his dog's braces.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.439
That would be amazing.
Wait, dogs get braces?

11:31.566 --> 11:33.692
He really needed them.
Now that dog's gorgeous.

11:33.819 --> 11:35.527
Uh, so how long does it take

11:35.612 --> 11:37.946
To do one of those
online link things?

11:38.031 --> 11:39.114
And... Here you go.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.490
Oh. That was fast.

11:40.659 --> 11:42.075
But then you got to let
people know about the link.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.285
-How's your
social media presence?
-Um...

11:44.371 --> 11:46.955
I don't think my phone has that.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.832
Well, you just need a way
to get the word out.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.083
Oh. The sign!

11:50.168 --> 11:51.209
I know. Stuff kept breaking,

11:51.378 --> 11:52.877
And evelyn
finally gave up on it.

11:52.963 --> 11:55.171
Wouldn't be so bad if it didn't
get so dark at night, you know?

11:55.298 --> 11:57.799
Right, nighttime's dark, but
if we can get the sign working,

11:57.884 --> 11:59.509
We could put the link on there.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.511
So everyone can see it
when they leave tonight,

12:01.596 --> 12:03.596
And people driving by
can see it, too.

12:03.682 --> 12:05.807
And maybe all lit up,
it'll remind people

12:05.892 --> 12:07.434
Of what this place used to be.

12:07.519 --> 12:10.270
Huh. Well... I mean, I can
get you a ladder

12:10.355 --> 12:11.521
And letters for the marquee.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.273
But I have no clue
how you'd fix the lights.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.942
Oh! I think I know
someone who can help.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.569
Teddy! Teddy!

12:17.696 --> 12:19.696
Shh. Hey, bob. You made it.

12:19.865 --> 12:21.114
Did you bring linda
and the kids?

12:21.158 --> 12:23.533
Yeah. I-I wouldn't come
to a drive-in by myself.

12:23.702 --> 12:24.701
Wait, why are we whispering?

12:24.828 --> 12:26.244
-My mom fell asleep.
-Oh.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.579
She, uh... She ate a gummy.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.497
She was really silly
when we left the house,

12:29.624 --> 12:32.041
But then she conked out
while we were driving over here.

12:32.169 --> 12:33.585
I'm just letting
her sleep it off.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.503
Oh. Okay. Uh...

12:35.630 --> 12:37.338
-Well, um, do you
have your tools?
-Yeah.

12:37.466 --> 12:38.757
Do you think you
could come with me

12:38.842 --> 12:40.258
And help fix the drive-in sign?

12:40.427 --> 12:42.051
Oh. Huh. Maybe.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.344
Wait, do you work here now?

12:43.430 --> 12:44.929
No. Uh, can you just
come with me?

12:45.098 --> 12:46.222
I-it's kind of urgent.

12:46.308 --> 12:47.849
Okay, just let me
leave my mom a note.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.976
Uh... I-I'll use
this gum wrapper.

12:50.061 --> 12:51.561
Okay, great. Fine. Here.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.104
"I went with bob..."

12:53.231 --> 12:54.773
-Oh, my god.
"...To fix sign.

12:54.858 --> 12:57.192
-Don't have a lot
of details about it."
-teddy.

12:57.235 --> 13:00.111
Eh, boy, I have to write
pretty small with this thing.

13:00.155 --> 13:01.821
Where's paper when you
need it? Right, bobby?

13:01.907 --> 13:04.324
Right, I know. I know.
Can we go? Now, please?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.701
Oh, my god, I forgot
how high this is.

13:06.828 --> 13:07.994
Forget it. Let's not do it.

13:08.079 --> 13:09.412
-Oh.
-Sorry, I mean...

13:09.498 --> 13:10.872
Uh, let's do it.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.081
Unless you don't want to.

13:12.209 --> 13:15.043
No, no, let's do it,
let's-let's do it. Yay.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.590
Well, I see why
we needed the ladder.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.175
Yeah, some of the rungs
on the pole rusted off.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.293
And then the lights broke.
And it was hard to fix.

13:24.346 --> 13:26.638
And then we were just like,
"what if there's no sign?

13:26.723 --> 13:27.931
People should just know things."

13:28.058 --> 13:29.599
-And of course the poison ivy.
-What?

13:29.684 --> 13:30.850
Or regular ivy. I'm not sure.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.727
It'll be a fun surprise
for later.

13:32.813 --> 13:35.438
Uh, I guess we should go up?

13:35.524 --> 13:37.190
Oh, god.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.527
[grunting]

13:40.695 --> 13:42.028
Wow. This is amazing.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.863
I'm surprised there aren't
more people up here.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.532
-Well, you can't hear it.
-Right.

13:45.700 --> 13:46.950
And if you fall off, you die.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.201
Right.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.702
Ooh, this is a good part.

13:49.788 --> 13:50.954
[crowd gasps in distance]

13:51.081 --> 13:52.622
-[ramona] that guy's a fly.
-[young bob] wow.

13:52.707 --> 13:55.041
It-it's amazing how you're able
to understand movies.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.751
[ramona]
thank you.

13:57.587 --> 13:58.711
[shudders] so high up.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.547
-[teddy] I think I can fix it.
-Oh. Great.

14:00.632 --> 14:02.131
I'll do what I can up here,

14:02.217 --> 14:04.217
And then there must be
a switch down at the base.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.594
Okay. Uh, quinn?
Tell me the link you made

14:06.680 --> 14:07.804
And let's start putting it up.

14:07.931 --> 14:12.183
Right. It's
www.Moneyprettyplease.Com/

14:12.227 --> 14:16.980
1478/save_the_cosmic_
drivein_now.

14:17.065 --> 14:20.108
That's so long.
Does it need to be that long?

14:20.151 --> 14:22.235
I mean, if we want them
to find the website

14:22.320 --> 14:24.153
And give money, then, yeah.

14:24.239 --> 14:25.905
Right. Right. Uh, okay.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.740
Well, we'll-we'll make it work.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.158
-[phone chimes]
-aah! Oh, god.

14:29.244 --> 14:30.702
It's a text from maryanne.

14:30.787 --> 14:31.995
-What's it say?
-"call me."

14:32.080 --> 14:34.622
Oh, my god. She's gonna kill me.
Over the phone.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.749
Let me think. Quiet. Wait.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.543
It is quiet.
That's freaking me out.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.879
Louise? Gene?
What's wrong with you two?

14:40.964 --> 14:42.589
We're fine, we're just
patiently waiting

14:42.716 --> 14:43.673
For the movie to start.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.425
And then my face
just got so cold.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.635
So I was wondering if I could
watch the movie this way.

14:47.762 --> 14:48.887
But no, sir. [chuckles]

14:49.014 --> 14:50.430
[gene]
yeah, good for warming the face,

14:50.515 --> 14:52.307
Bad for watching the show.
Can't have it all.

14:52.434 --> 14:54.434
Huh. Yeah. Dark.

14:54.519 --> 14:56.227
I'm surprised,
but I'm not surprised.

15:04.321 --> 15:07.280
Ah, I'm gonna go back and check
on my mom. You guys good?

15:07.365 --> 15:08.489
Yup! Thanks again!

15:08.575 --> 15:09.782
I'd better get back
to the concession stand.

15:09.868 --> 15:10.992
It would suck to lose my job

15:11.119 --> 15:12.410
On the last night
this place is open.

15:12.495 --> 15:15.038
Hopefully it's not
the last night.

15:21.963 --> 15:23.129
[sighs]

15:23.924 --> 15:26.466
I never want to watch
a movie<i> not</i> from up here.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.552
Yeah. They probably have
drive-ins in ohio, right?

15:29.679 --> 15:30.803
They're everywhere, I think.

15:30.889 --> 15:32.430
What, they're gonna stop
having drive-ins?

15:32.515 --> 15:33.973
Oh, boy, here it comes.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.186
-He crushed that
fly-guy with a rock.
-Yeah.

15:38.313 --> 15:40.813
Seems kinda harsh. Just because
he was a little different.

15:40.899 --> 15:46.194
But it's not like he was ever
gonna be mr. Tons of friends.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.654
[sighs]

15:47.739 --> 15:48.947
I'd be friends with him.

15:49.074 --> 15:50.531
-Yeah?
-Sure.

15:50.659 --> 15:53.576
If he promised to, like, not
land in poop when we hang out.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.662
Yeah, that seems reasonable.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.498
Okay. Better go.

15:59.501 --> 16:02.168
Ah! Oh, no, no, no. No.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.002
Crap.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.088
All right. I'll just call--

16:05.256 --> 16:06.047
No!

16:06.132 --> 16:07.799
I did not just drop my phone.

16:07.926 --> 16:09.968
I did. I just dropped my phone.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.762
Teddy! Quinn! Teddy!

16:12.889 --> 16:14.639
-Anyone!
-[horn honking]

16:14.724 --> 16:17.100
Uh, thanks. Thanks so much.

16:21.106 --> 16:23.356
Oh, god. Okay.
I mean, the rungs aren't...

16:23.441 --> 16:25.233
That rusty.

16:25.276 --> 16:26.526
Maybe?

16:26.653 --> 16:28.528
[grunting]

16:31.491 --> 16:33.324
Okay. So far so g... Ah!

16:33.410 --> 16:36.911
[gasps] yeah, that's okay.
That's fine.

-[thuds]

16:38.707 --> 16:40.665

16:40.750 --> 16:41.749
Break anything?

16:41.918 --> 16:44.502
Everything hurts,
but nothing's broken.

16:44.587 --> 16:45.586
That's good.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.213
[tina]
maybe just call her?

16:47.298 --> 16:48.965
But then I have to talk to her.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.591
[gene]
do you want me to call
and pretend to be you?

16:50.677 --> 16:51.876
I do a pretty good linda.

16:51.970 --> 16:52.844
"hi, I'm linda."

16:52.971 --> 16:54.262
[tina]
whoa. That is good.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.680
So, uh, still having
blanket time?

16:55.807 --> 16:56.973
-[louise] yeah.
-[gene] yeah.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.474
Uh, I found the fart smell
unpleasant.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.643
Ugh. I just don't know
what to say to her.

17:00.770 --> 17:01.644
Maybe just be honest?

17:01.813 --> 17:03.146
Tell her you got frustrated

17:03.231 --> 17:05.106
And you did something
kind of mean and you're sorry?

17:05.233 --> 17:07.066
Okay. Okay, fine.
I'll be honest.

17:07.152 --> 17:09.110
But I might make this call
away from you guys,

17:09.154 --> 17:10.903
In case I change my mind
about the honesty thing.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.406
'cause<i> someone</i> can be
a little judgy.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.241
I think I might
stretch my legs, too.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.786
[gasps] geez, gene,
what is the matter with you?

17:18.830 --> 17:20.580
-What have you been eating?
-Candy.

17:20.665 --> 17:21.789
-Aha!
-[screaming]

17:21.875 --> 17:23.458
I knew it.
Caught you blue... Mouthed!

17:23.501 --> 17:25.793
-You ate my ka-bloozies.
-When did you know?

17:25.879 --> 17:27.670
Pretty much right away.
Because it was so obvious.

17:27.756 --> 17:30.048
Plus, no one would stay under
a blanket with gene that long.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.633
We're sorry. We didn't know
they were your favorite.

17:32.802 --> 17:36.220
So, are we getting
our candy privileges revoked?

17:36.347 --> 17:38.097
-Or just gene maybe?
-Hey.

17:38.183 --> 17:40.600
No. It was entertaining.
Not as good as a movie,

17:40.685 --> 17:42.393
But a little better than
watching mom freak out.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.812
And there's still one left.
I-I can work with that.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.982
-So we'll split it three ways?
-No. No. Back under the blanket.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.984
[groaning]

17:50.070 --> 17:51.360

17:51.446 --> 17:52.653
Whoa, what happened to you?

17:52.739 --> 17:55.531
Hey, quinn. Uh, I sort of
pushed over the ladder

17:55.658 --> 17:57.784
And I had to climb down
the rungs and I almost died.

17:57.869 --> 17:59.077
It-it's fine.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.746
Cool. Well, I just saw evelyn
heading for the stage.

18:01.873 --> 18:03.039
They must have fixed
the projector.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.249
Oh! I-I should go tell her
about the sign.

18:05.335 --> 18:06.834
So she can tell people about it,

18:06.920 --> 18:08.669
And if people want to applaud
when they see the sign,

18:08.755 --> 18:10.213
Then that's fine, too.

18:10.298 --> 18:11.964
[grunts] okay. Ow. Ow.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.634
Evelyn. Hi. Can I, uh,
can I just real quick--

18:14.761 --> 18:17.678
Maybe we can chat after I
do this, heavy-breathing guy?

18:17.889 --> 18:19.597
I'll be right back. Or I won't.

18:19.682 --> 18:20.932
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.892
Hello, everyone.
Thank you for your patience.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.061
We're ready to roll
the film, so...

18:25.146 --> 18:27.980
Wait, the sign's on?
Well, what-what does it say?

18:28.066 --> 18:30.024
It's a moneyprettyplease
website thing.

18:30.193 --> 18:31.776
What? Wha... I can't hear you.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.111
We put a website on the sign.

18:33.196 --> 18:35.822
Wait, wait, wait, h-hold on.
What are you saying?

18:35.907 --> 18:38.116
Uh, hi. So, uh, me
and some others

18:38.243 --> 18:41.035
Put a link to a fundraising
website on the marquee.

18:41.204 --> 18:42.486
Is that your dad?

18:42.539 --> 18:44.497
We were trying to raise money
for the drive-in

18:44.624 --> 18:46.749
-So you don't have to sell.
-What? Really?

18:46.835 --> 18:49.585
Yes. Look, uh, I-I'm a small
business owner, too.

18:49.671 --> 18:52.588
I-I get how hard it is
to keep a place going.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.633
And th-this place is special.
It-it means something.

18:55.718 --> 18:57.844
All I'm saying is,
maybe this could help?

18:57.929 --> 18:59.262
And maybe you could hold off

18:59.347 --> 19:00.805
On putting this place
up for sale?

19:00.890 --> 19:02.765
Oh, no, honey. I want to sell.

19:02.851 --> 19:05.476
-Y-y-you do?
-Oh, yes. Very much.

19:05.562 --> 19:08.980
Listen, I'm sad to say goodbye,
but I-I want to retire

19:09.065 --> 19:12.191
And-and travel and spend
more time with my grandkids.

19:12.277 --> 19:14.193
-Even the annoying one.
-Oh.

19:14.362 --> 19:17.029
Also, when's the last time
you were here, huh? Be honest.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.197
Um... Well--

19:18.283 --> 19:19.866
-Yeah?
-I-I mean, I,

19:19.951 --> 19:21.033
I used to come here, um...

19:21.202 --> 19:23.578
And I have some
really great memories here.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.580
Well, those aren't
going anywhere, are they?

19:25.707 --> 19:28.624
I'm not selling those.
I mean, if I could, I would,

19:28.751 --> 19:31.043
But I don't know how
that technology would work.

19:31.129 --> 19:32.420
Right. O-okay.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.213
I-I mean, I'm glad
you're happy.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.966
I-I did fall pretty far.
But it's fine.

19:37.093 --> 19:38.593
Do you mind if I go back

19:38.678 --> 19:41.012
To all the people waiting
for me to finish talking?

19:41.097 --> 19:43.306

-What?
-Here you go, sir.

19:51.232 --> 19:52.732

19:52.859 --> 19:54.400

-I mean, are you okay, hon?
-Yeah.

19:56.654 --> 19:59.572
I-I'm just glad this place
was here while it was.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.033
Sorry, kids. Sorry I couldn't
save it for you.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.202
Dad, you know movies
still exist, right?

20:04.287 --> 20:05.912
And we can watch them
in fun places

20:05.997 --> 20:08.080
And brag about it
to our kids someday?

20:08.208 --> 20:09.415

20:09.542 --> 20:10.791

20:12.295 --> 20:14.253

Turns out she's a lovely person
but terrible on text.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.175
Also, they're housebreaking
their new puppy,

20:19.219 --> 20:20.793
So she was all distracted
by that.

20:20.845 --> 20:23.679
Anyway, I'm never gonna gossip
about anyone ever again.

20:23.806 --> 20:25.014
-That's nice.
-And look,

20:25.099 --> 20:26.599
She sent me a picture
of the puppy.

20:26.726 --> 20:27.683
Aw. Oh.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.936

puppies could be ugly?

Sorry, last gossip.
