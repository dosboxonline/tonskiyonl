She's never done anything

No.

I'd like to believe that.

01:46.982 --> 01:50.569
that you just had to steal it?

into the waiting room.

another four clients.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.757
a cash withdrawal.

I couldn't get a good angle

09:50.757 --> 09:52.759
through the window,

09:52.759 --> 09:56.137
four, maybe five stacks.
