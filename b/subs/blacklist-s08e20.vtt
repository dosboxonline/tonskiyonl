Things are never going back
to the way they were.

00:07.549 --> 00:09.634
It's Ressler. I've been shot.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.428
We need to find Bino.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.972
You know what Townsend
will do to me when he discovers

00:14.055 --> 00:16.516
that I'm the one who helped you?
I'm turning them over.

00:16.599 --> 00:17.892
That'd be a mistake.

00:39.581 --> 00:42.876
Four out front, another four are
making their way back to the alley.

00:44.043 --> 00:44.961
Too many.

00:45.044 --> 00:47.547
Bino, we had a deal.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.632
Open the door or we'll open it.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.385
-They're covering all the exits.
-[Raymond] Not all the exits.

00:52.469 --> 00:55.847
Bino's got pipelines running
all over the Seventh Ward.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.017
My guess is those pipes end here.

00:59.100 --> 01:02.145
He's not walking millions in cash
through the door.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.481
There must be some hidden passageway.

01:05.231 --> 01:08.026
Bino could've told us
if you hadn't killed him.

01:08.109 --> 01:10.695
Perhaps we can set aside
our differences just long enough

01:10.779 --> 01:12.113
to get us out of here.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.114
They're coming.

01:19.704 --> 01:21.581
I'm not setting aside our disagreements.

Hold them in abeyance. Let them simmer.

01:25.835 --> 01:28.505
You help me? Who's helping who?

01:28.588 --> 01:31.591
Considering the circumstances,
how about we help each other?

01:35.720 --> 01:37.764
This wall has gaps in it.

you away from the others.

06:08.284 --> 06:09.535
So we could talk.

06:11.788 --> 06:15.333
Although... I'm not sure where to begin.

06:16.209 --> 06:20.463
So let's talk about the end.
Because that's where we are, the end.

06:21.255 --> 06:25.384
This has gone too far,
cost too many lives, hurt too many people.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.681
Is Ressler gonna be okay?

06:33.476 --> 06:35.103
I honestly don't know.

06:35.686 --> 06:37.480
But he's gonna make it, right?

06:37.563 --> 06:39.774
If I thought you'd
be safe with Reddington,

06:39.857 --> 06:44.112
I'd turn a blind eye, let him ferry
you away to a new name, a new life.

I wish I believed that existed for you,
but I don't, not anymore.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.743
Let me help you. Not just with Townsend,

06:50.827 --> 06:53.621
but with everything that comes after.
The courts, your safety,

06:53.704 --> 06:55.123
your daughter's safety.

06:55.206 --> 07:00.461
Reddington's way, the renegade way,

07:19.063 --> 07:21.357
How can you possibly keep me safe?

07:24.610 --> 07:25.820
Not how, Elizabeth.

Where.

But she's in the wind. We lost her.

-She surrendered?
<i>-It was her choice, not mine.</i>

07:58.728 --> 08:01.606
She can't keep running
and she can't beat Townsend alone.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.066
She's not alone. She's never been alone.

not being available to make them.

-He is.

And Neville didn't know because you
weren't around to do his due diligence,

-You, Neville's little go-to guy.

I've been telling myself...
none of this is you.

11:34.568 --> 11:37.655
Maybe she was the illusion all along.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.604
or who I've become.

12:11.981 --> 12:15.443
I think anyone who's gone through
what I went through

"Entitled"?

12:42.553 --> 12:44.972
-I think we're past that.
-Fair enough.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.517
Then for the other Liz.

12:50.728 --> 12:51.854
For your friend.

Please?

13:03.199 --> 13:05.659
You want us to cut a deal with Keen?

13:05.743 --> 13:08.037
Come on. You knew this was coming.

13:08.120 --> 13:11.207
I didn't. Now that you're asking,
the answer's no.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.750
Your indignation is duly noted.

13:12.833 --> 13:15.085
-For the record, I'd like to remind--
-I get it.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.963
You care for Keen.
You don't wanna see her sent to prison,

13:18.047 --> 13:20.424
even though you know that is
what she deserves.

13:20.508 --> 13:23.594
You know her record, what she was,
who she was before Reddington.

13:23.677 --> 13:25.179
You know what's happened to her.

13:25.262 --> 13:26.931
Knowing that, can you tell me

13:27.014 --> 13:29.683
what she deserves
is to spend her life in a supermax?

13:29.767 --> 13:32.019
That's exactly what she deserves.

13:32.102 --> 13:34.939
The attorney general
is waiting on an update.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.900
There wouldn't have been
a task force without Keen.

13:38.567 --> 13:41.987
She's as responsible as Reddington
for all the people we've caught.

13:43.531 --> 13:46.033
Harold, you can't win.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.661
Sorry. I know it breaks your heart.

13:48.744 --> 13:51.205
But Keen will be prosecuted.

13:57.878 --> 14:01.257
-You only get one call.
-Where did these agents come from?

14:01.340 --> 14:03.342
Oh, Ms. Panabaker had them sent.

14:03.425 --> 14:05.302
She says it's to keep you safe.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.680
She's worried one of us
might help you escape.

14:07.763 --> 14:09.515
Did you vet them at least?

14:09.598 --> 14:12.518
Why? You think Townsend's
got people inside the FBI?

14:16.188 --> 14:20.025
-You should be calling a lawyer.
-A lawyer can't help me now.

14:34.623 --> 14:36.292
I did and I don't.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.586
What did Panabaker say?

14:38.669 --> 14:41.922
I don't know, which can't be a good thing.

14:43.257 --> 14:47.970
-This isn't where I thought we'd end up.
-This isn't the end, not for you.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.181
That's not what I meant.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.349
I know.

14:53.392 --> 14:54.894
This is how it has to be.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.732
[helicopter whirring]

15:00.983 --> 15:03.402
-What's that?
-I don't know.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.362
That sounds like...

15:05.446 --> 15:07.323
[dramatic music playing]

15:07.406 --> 15:08.407
Oh, no.

15:11.327 --> 15:14.872
I'm sorry, say that again.
Chopper? You're sure?

15:17.666 --> 15:20.544
Get Incident Response
to the holding bay and alert the guards.

15:21.128 --> 15:22.171
<i>It's Townsend.</i>

15:26.383 --> 15:28.719
-[Ressler] <i>What is that? What's going on?</i>
-I don't know.

15:30.304 --> 15:33.057
Yes, Code Black. Rapid deploy HRT

15:33.140 --> 15:36.769
and notify all non-tactical
support personnel to shelter in place.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.742
Aram, get out of here!

15:51.825 --> 15:53.077
Go! Now!

15:53.577 --> 15:54.411
[Ressler] <i>Keen.</i>

15:55.162 --> 15:56.163
Keen, are you there?

16:15.140 --> 16:17.893
Sector command, talk to me.
What's going on?

16:17.977 --> 16:20.145
-[man] <i>Can't see into the room, sir.</i>
-Take cover! Go!

16:29.655 --> 16:31.657
[clanking]

16:41.750 --> 16:43.085
Hang on!

16:48.048 --> 16:50.050
[gasping]

17:07.401 --> 17:08.902
[pensive music playing]

17:08.986 --> 17:11.280
The masks make
facial recognition impossible,

17:11.363 --> 17:14.283
and there was no tail number
on the chopper that yanked out Keen,

17:14.366 --> 17:16.035
which was kind of badass.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.538
I mean, terrible.

17:19.621 --> 17:22.291
Anyway, no tail number,
no registered owner.

17:22.374 --> 17:25.044
-We don't need one. We know who owns it.
-Neville Townsend.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.379
I don't wanna think about what that means.

17:27.463 --> 17:30.090
It means we have to get her back.
The people we interviewed

17:30.174 --> 17:33.010
from the raid on Townsend's
accounting firm, reinterview them.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.678
Uh, they've been in custody.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.306
I doubt they have any leads on where
Townsend took Liz.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.349
They may be able
to tell us who helped him.

17:39.433 --> 17:43.312
Extracting Keen from the Post Office
required planning, skill and precision.

17:43.395 --> 17:44.354
I want a name.

17:45.105 --> 17:48.525
Tell me again, you and Edna,
how you two met.

17:49.610 --> 17:50.778
Veterinary school.

17:50.861 --> 17:54.698
We were paired to do
a necropsy on a tortoise.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.786
I was hooked the minute I saw her
drain the entrails.

17:58.869 --> 18:02.748
The way she handles a knife,
she could've been a chef at Benihana.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.794
I appreciate
you bringing her in on this, Teddy.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.504
Oh, you know me.

18:08.587 --> 18:12.341
I cup the balls, give them a tickle,
maybe a squeeze.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.552
You need them cut off, Ema's your Abba.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.137
[Edna] It's done.

18:17.221 --> 18:18.722
The chip is in his neck.

18:18.806 --> 18:19.723
[Liz] Are you insane?

18:19.807 --> 18:22.768
-Elizabeth, you know Brimley.
-It's a pleasure.

18:22.851 --> 18:25.354
But I don't believe you know
his lovely wife Edna.

18:25.437 --> 18:28.398
You sent a commando team to blow
the roof off the Post Office?

18:28.482 --> 18:32.694
I like the gumption,
but cork it until I'm done. Okay?

18:32.778 --> 18:35.447
The chip is in his neck.
The tracking device is set.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.951
As soon as he wakes up
and shakes off the hangover,

18:39.034 --> 18:43.664
he goes to Townsend, Townsend goes to him,
voilà, you got a front-row seat.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.332
Edna, you're a lifesaver.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.960
I know. It's reflected in my fee.

18:48.043 --> 18:49.753
All this time, she can't walk,

18:49.837 --> 18:52.965
I can't breathe,
but I still cherish every day.

18:53.048 --> 18:55.425
Come, Teddy. Let's go. Come on.

18:56.176 --> 18:59.054
-Some days more than others.
-[Raymond chuckling]

18:59.138 --> 19:00.681
[Teddy] Come on, dear. Let's go.

19:00.764 --> 19:01.932
[Edna] Now.

19:02.015 --> 19:06.103
I broke you out to keep you from spending
the rest of your days in a supermax.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.438
I'd rather be there than here.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.150
I have something to show you.

19:12.317 --> 19:16.697
But an opportunity to neutralize
Townsend has presented itself...

19:17.322 --> 19:20.159
and I think it prudent
to deal with that first.

19:22.286 --> 19:26.790
In the meantime, I hope you'll think
of yourself as less of a prisoner

19:26.874 --> 19:28.876
and more of a guest.

19:41.805 --> 19:45.017
-She's gone?
-[Cooper] Extracted through the roof.

19:45.100 --> 19:48.645
-I can show you if you'd like.
-I'd like an explanation.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.105
We believe it was Townsend.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.734
And I believe my ex might someday
remove his face from the ample bosom

19:53.817 --> 19:55.360
of the 32-year-old he left me for.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.864
But that seems about as likely
as Neville Townsend blowing the roof off

19:58.947 --> 20:01.825
an FBI black site and extracting
an 8000-pound steel box

20:01.909 --> 20:03.660
containing a wanted fugitive.

20:03.744 --> 20:06.663
Townsend's the only one with the means,
the matériel, the motive.

20:06.747 --> 20:10.417
-Other than you and Reddington?
-You think I blew a hole in my own roof?

20:10.500 --> 20:12.502
What am I supposed to think?

20:12.586 --> 20:15.297
You come asking me
to go easy on Keen, I say no,

20:15.380 --> 20:18.634
and wonder of wonders, a helicopter
magically appears to fly her away.

20:18.717 --> 20:21.220
Keen's a fugitive
and someone I care about.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.138
If I'm right and Townsend did take her,

20:23.222 --> 20:27.309
-every second we waste might be her last.
-I don't think he orchestrated it.

20:27.392 --> 20:30.270
This has got Reddington's
paw prints all over it.

20:30.354 --> 20:34.399
I find it hard to believe
he'd do it without talking to you first.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.694
-Is there anything else?
-I wanna hear from Reddington.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.613
He had nothing to do with this.

20:39.696 --> 20:43.367
He's our CI. I don't think there's
any problem with asking him to come in

20:43.450 --> 20:46.870
so he can at least pay me
the courtesy of lying to my face.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.081
You have until this time tomorrow.

20:54.878 --> 20:57.130
[horse whinnies]

21:00.092 --> 21:01.635
-[Godwin groaning]
-Hey.

21:04.179 --> 21:06.014
Hey, anybody there?

21:07.808 --> 21:08.976
Can you hear me?

21:10.185 --> 21:11.186
Elizabeth?

21:11.270 --> 21:13.230
-Is that you?
-Yes.

21:13.855 --> 21:15.482
It's me, Godwin.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.734
Godwin Page.

21:17.818 --> 21:18.735
[Liz] Godwin.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.405
Good. Very good.

21:21.488 --> 21:23.448
[Godwin] I don't see what's good about it.

21:24.199 --> 21:25.659
For either of us.

21:25.742 --> 21:27.577
Townsend trusts you.

21:28.453 --> 21:29.788
He wants to kill me.

21:29.871 --> 21:31.206
I heard.

21:32.165 --> 21:37.045
VanDyke says you're special to Reddington,

21:37.129 --> 21:39.673
that you represent a weakness in him.

21:39.756 --> 21:41.341
[Liz] Did he tell you why?

21:41.425 --> 21:42.801
[Godwin] No, tell me.

21:42.884 --> 21:45.762
[Liz] I would if I could,
but I don't know.

21:45.846 --> 21:48.932
What I do know is
I know how to get out of here.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.851
And I can help you get out too.

21:50.934 --> 21:54.896
If you agree to talk to Townsend,
broker a deal.

21:55.480 --> 21:56.940
[Godwin] What kind of a deal?

21:57.024 --> 22:00.319
[Liz] Reddington's responsible
for the death of his family.

22:00.402 --> 22:03.322
If Townsend agrees to leave me
and my daughter alone,

22:03.405 --> 22:05.449
leave the FBI out of it,

22:05.532 --> 22:08.452
I can make sure he gets
the revenge he wants.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.288
[Godwin] You'll give him Reddington.

22:11.371 --> 22:13.081
On a silver platter.

22:14.124 --> 22:16.877
Either help me give Townsend
Reddington's head,

22:16.960 --> 22:20.505
or Reddington comes for yours.
What's it gonna be?

22:23.383 --> 22:25.552
Tell me how we're going to escape.

22:30.348 --> 22:32.100
[ringing]

22:32.184 --> 22:35.645
Hey, hey, I'm here.
Tell me what's going on. Is he better?

22:35.729 --> 22:39.357
He's anything but better.
Doctors think he may have sepsis.

22:39.441 --> 22:41.943
Had to intubate him.
They got him full of antibiotics.

22:42.027 --> 22:44.696
Okay, uh, but what does that mean?

22:44.780 --> 22:46.073
<i>Aram, I don't know.</i>

22:46.156 --> 22:51.203
They need time. They're trying to increase
his blood pressure. That's all I know.

22:51.286 --> 22:53.789
<i>What about you? Are you still on lockdown?</i>

22:53.872 --> 22:57.876
Uh, no, but... Liz was taken.

22:57.959 --> 23:01.046
-What are you talking about?
<i>-Townsend extracted her.</i>

23:01.129 --> 23:02.464
From the orange box?

23:02.547 --> 23:03.757
<i>In it, actually.</i>

23:03.840 --> 23:05.425
I do have some good news.

23:05.509 --> 23:09.137
I think I figured out the name of the guy
who pulled it off.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.847
Godwin Page.

23:10.931 --> 23:14.351
Everyone we arrested says Page
is Townsend's number two,

23:14.434 --> 23:15.769
a logistical genius.

23:15.852 --> 23:19.689
If we can get to Page,
he may be able to help us find Liz.

23:19.773 --> 23:22.317
-Where is he?
<i>-That's the bad news. He's in the wind.</i>

23:22.400 --> 23:26.613
We've got some taps on some of
his associates, but so far, nothing.

23:26.696 --> 23:29.241
You think she's okay? Agent Keen?

23:29.908 --> 23:33.286
I'm a firm believer that
perpetual optimism is a force multiplier.

23:33.370 --> 23:36.331
But I have to admit,
I have a really bad feeling.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.834
Here, I want you to take this.

23:40.627 --> 23:43.296
A paring knife? That's what I'm
supposed to use to escape?

23:43.380 --> 23:46.341
I don't want you to use it on them.
I want you to use it on you.

23:46.424 --> 23:47.509
Say that again?

23:47.592 --> 23:50.929
I heard them talking.
They implanted a chip in your neck.

23:51.680 --> 23:54.307
Reach back, see if you can
feel the incision.

23:57.644 --> 23:58.728
I feel something.

23:58.812 --> 24:01.148
If it's anything like the ones
Reddington's used,

24:01.231 --> 24:04.734
it's implanted about a quarter inch
under the skin. Cut it out.

24:04.818 --> 24:06.778
I have to what? I can't do that.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.655
-Use the tip.
-You're mad.

24:08.738 --> 24:11.658
Reopen the wound.
Don't think about it, Godwin.

24:11.741 --> 24:13.410
Just make the cut.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.412
Once you've opened the incision,

24:15.495 --> 24:17.831
you need to reach down
and try to feel the chip.

24:18.415 --> 24:20.000
[grunting]

24:22.377 --> 24:24.087
You got it. You got it.

24:26.047 --> 24:27.007
I can't feel it.

24:27.090 --> 24:31.094
You don't have to feel it.
Get under the incision, pinch and lift.

24:34.014 --> 24:37.267
Okay. Okay. I have it.

24:37.350 --> 24:39.519
[Liz] Okay, good. Good.

24:42.814 --> 24:43.857
Give it to me.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.571
[sighs] This is good.

24:49.654 --> 24:52.115
-[Godwin] It doesn't feel good.
-No, this is a BetaStar chip.

24:52.199 --> 24:55.118
-It's using a simplex protocol.
-I don't know what that means.

24:55.202 --> 24:57.412
That number, that's its ID.

24:57.495 --> 25:00.290
It's vulnerable to interference.
If you give it to Townsend,

25:00.373 --> 25:03.335
his people should be able
to intercept it, which means--

25:03.418 --> 25:05.212
It would lead them to Reddington.

25:05.754 --> 25:09.925
Assume Townsend accepts your deal,
what then? How will he know?

25:10.008 --> 25:13.303
There's a hotel off I-95, the Golden Leaf.

25:13.386 --> 25:16.640
Book a suite
under the name Margaret French.

25:17.349 --> 25:21.686
When I call, if that room is booked,
I'll turn back on the tracking.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.398
Here. This is the number. Memorize it.

25:31.488 --> 25:32.322
[beeps]

25:32.948 --> 25:34.658
-What's going on?
-[man] <i>All quiet here.</i>

25:34.741 --> 25:38.536
I just got a notification
that we lost the signal on Page's chip.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.039
<i>-Some kind of malfunction?</i>
-Possibly.

25:41.122 --> 25:45.126
Or he found a way to disable it.
Check it out. I'll be right there.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.671
[dramatic music playing]

26:02.060 --> 26:03.853
[grunting]

26:12.320 --> 26:13.238
Morgan.

26:13.321 --> 26:15.115
-[Morgan] Page is gone.
-What happened?

26:15.198 --> 26:17.242
Somehow he disabled the chip.

26:17.325 --> 26:19.369
-How?
-I don't know.

26:28.628 --> 26:29.963
What'd you do?

26:30.505 --> 26:33.341
Nothing. Why? Did something happen?

26:34.426 --> 26:36.803
I don't understand.
Why would you help him?

26:36.886 --> 26:37.971
I didn't.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.017
[Cooper] <i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

26:42.100 --> 26:45.895
[Raymond] <i>Catch your breath. Lie down</i>
<i>if you need. This is good news.</i>

26:45.979 --> 26:48.064
-You attacked a federal facility.
-I did.

26:48.148 --> 26:49.774
<i>-Abducted a fugitive.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

26:49.858 --> 26:52.027
Put the lives of
federal agents in jeopardy.

26:52.110 --> 26:53.903
No one was really in jeopardy.

26:53.987 --> 26:57.240
And I thought you'd be happy to hear
she wasn't snatched by Townsend.

26:57.324 --> 27:00.327
I defended you to Panabaker,
that you had nothing to do with this.

27:00.410 --> 27:04.789
If it'll make her feel any better,
tell Cynthia to put the roof on my tab.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.333
Or I have a guy.

27:06.416 --> 27:09.669
You really don't see it, do you?
You're incapable of it.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.963
-She wants to do the right thing.
<i>-No.</i>

27:12.047 --> 27:14.299
What Elizabeth wants is answers.

27:14.382 --> 27:18.303
Answers about who she is
and why I came into her life.

27:18.386 --> 27:22.766
Answers that I've specifically withheld
to keep her safe.

27:22.849 --> 27:25.894
-Hell of a job you've done.
-I agree. I can't keep her safe.

27:25.977 --> 27:29.814
Not anymore. The only way to do
that is to give her the truth.

27:29.898 --> 27:33.526
-You're gonna tell her you're N-13?
-I'm gonna tell her everything.

27:41.493 --> 27:44.621
Why are you telling me this?
We thought Townsend took Liz.

27:44.704 --> 27:47.082
You wouldn't loop me in
unless you needed something.

27:47.165 --> 27:49.709
What do you know about Godwin Page?

27:49.793 --> 27:51.419
He's Townsend's number two.

27:51.503 --> 27:56.049
We were under the impression that
he was responsible for Keen's extraction.

27:56.132 --> 27:59.886
<i>-Been looking for him without success.</i>
-And because he was in my custody.

27:59.969 --> 28:02.097
-You have Page?
<i>-Had.</i>

28:02.180 --> 28:06.810
He escaped. That's what I want from you,
your help to find Godwin Page.

28:06.893 --> 28:10.563
Based on where he was
as of about ten minutes ago,

28:10.647 --> 28:14.984
you should drop your net, or bait
your hook, or whatever it is you do,

28:15.068 --> 28:17.195
in and around Loudoun County.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.365
[cell phone rings]

28:20.949 --> 28:22.325
<i>It's me. Godwin.</i>

28:22.409 --> 28:25.078
-What is going on?
<i>-Reddington. He got to me.</i>

28:25.161 --> 28:27.789
Had his people interrogate me
trying to find you.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.250
<i>-Where are you now?</i>
-I got out.

28:30.333 --> 28:32.502
I killed one of his men.
At least, I think he's dead.

28:32.585 --> 28:34.963
You escaped? [chuckles]

28:35.046 --> 28:37.799
I was suspicious before.
But now I'm certain you're lying.

28:37.882 --> 28:41.136
-Reddington doesn't make those mistakes.
-It was Keen.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.595
She helped me escape.

28:42.679 --> 28:45.765
-Why would she do that?
<i>-She wants to make a deal.</i>

28:45.849 --> 28:50.145
She's willing to deliver Reddington
if you agree to let it end there.

28:50.228 --> 28:51.438
Deliver him how?

28:51.521 --> 28:53.940
<i>She has a microchip tracking device.</i>

28:54.023 --> 28:58.153
She's with Reddington now. If you agree,
she'll turn it on so you can find them.

28:58.236 --> 29:00.196
-But Keen--
<i>-Does she matter?</i>

29:00.280 --> 29:02.365
<i>It's Reddington you want.</i>

29:02.449 --> 29:04.451
Reddington's death
won't balance the scales.

29:04.534 --> 29:06.286
I want him to watch her die.

29:06.369 --> 29:08.663
Neville, make the deal.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.166
-Are you ordering me--?
<i>-I'm advising you.</i>

29:11.249 --> 29:14.794
<i>As a colleague and trusted friend,</i>
<i>you need to end this.</i>

29:14.878 --> 29:17.922
Killing Reddington is enough.
It's what you want.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.551
-Why would I trust Keen?
<i>-You have nothing to lose, Neville.</i>

29:21.634 --> 29:23.803
This is our window. Make the deal.

29:25.305 --> 29:28.600
What exactly does Keen have in mind?

29:33.313 --> 29:35.857
[pensive music playing]

29:35.940 --> 29:38.651
-Reddington took Keen?
-[Aram] <i>That's what Cooper says.</i>

29:38.735 --> 29:39.944
What does he want?

29:40.028 --> 29:43.573
That would require a lot of therapy
on Mr. Reddington's part.

29:43.656 --> 29:47.202
<i>If I had to guess, it has something to do</i>
<i>with him not trusting the Bureau.</i>

29:47.285 --> 29:51.122
But good news, though, uh,
he got us a lead on Godwin Page.

29:51.206 --> 29:53.708
-How can he lead us to Keen?
<i>-He can't.</i>

29:53.792 --> 29:56.085
But he might lead us to Townsend.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.755
Loudoun County Sheriff's Department
just picked him up

29:58.838 --> 30:00.924
<i>and he is being brought in.</i>

30:01.007 --> 30:02.425
What's going on?

30:02.509 --> 30:05.011
-What? Is it Ressler?
-What's going on?

30:05.094 --> 30:09.015
-His pressure dropped. He went into V-fib.
-Continue compressions and push epi.

30:09.098 --> 30:10.433
I'll call you back.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.732
-Wait outside.
-Is he okay?

30:17.816 --> 30:19.442
I'll find you when we know.

30:22.028 --> 30:23.822
-We have to go.
-Where?

30:24.781 --> 30:27.575
Somewhere your friend Page
won't be able to find us.

30:27.659 --> 30:28.993
He's not my friend.

30:29.077 --> 30:32.372
Before we go,
I'd like to make arrangements for Agnes.

30:32.455 --> 30:35.708
When I woke up this morning,
I didn't anticipate being held hostage.

30:42.966 --> 30:45.176
[man] <i>Golden Leaf Hotel.</i>
<i>How may I direct your call?</i>

30:45.260 --> 30:47.887
-Margaret French, please?
<i>-Of course.</i>

30:47.971 --> 30:49.764
<i>Putting you through to her right now.</i>

30:49.848 --> 30:51.850
[ringing]

30:54.686 --> 30:57.689
-Smart girl.
-Mrs. French, hi. Um...

30:57.772 --> 31:00.692
I am trapped at work and can't get away.

31:00.775 --> 31:03.319
-Reddington's with you.
-Could you stay with Agnes?

31:03.403 --> 31:05.196
<i>Clueless that his beloved Elizabeth</i>

31:05.280 --> 31:08.199
just bought her own freedom
by sentencing him to death.

31:08.283 --> 31:09.659
<i>Hope to see you soon.</i>

31:09.742 --> 31:12.537
We're prepared to intercept
the signal when you turn it on.

31:12.620 --> 31:14.747
Thanks. You're a lifesaver.

31:16.958 --> 31:20.503
It's a wonder how you're a good mother
when yours was so bad.

31:21.796 --> 31:24.132
-I don't know where he is.
-Mr. Page.

31:24.757 --> 31:26.759
If you refuse to help us,

31:26.843 --> 31:30.471
the U.S. government
will come at you with both barrels.

31:31.014 --> 31:33.892
Even if I did know, I wouldn't help you.

31:34.684 --> 31:37.020
-I won't betray him.
-Just to be clear,

31:37.103 --> 31:40.356
the U.S. government
has very big barrels, like...

31:41.232 --> 31:43.985
winery size, huge.

31:44.068 --> 31:47.322
But I may have something better.

31:47.405 --> 31:50.116
Better? What does that mean?

31:53.411 --> 31:55.747
[pensive music playing]

31:55.830 --> 31:58.583
I've kept things from you
for your own good.

31:58.666 --> 32:00.877
[groans] This old song.

32:00.960 --> 32:05.006
Now your own good requires me
to tell you everything.

32:10.637 --> 32:14.307
-I hear you want immunity.
-He has info about Elizabeth.

32:14.390 --> 32:17.226
I can tell you where she is
and what she's doing.

32:18.019 --> 32:20.939
But first, I need to know I'm protected.

32:21.522 --> 32:23.524
[cell phone buzzing]

32:24.275 --> 32:27.028
-It's Harold.
-Harold will have to wait.

32:30.531 --> 32:32.992
Reddington, call me
as soon as you get this message.

32:33.076 --> 32:34.410
We brought in Page.

32:34.494 --> 32:37.205
Keen helped him
pull the chip you put in his neck.

32:37.288 --> 32:40.959
They made a deal. If she helped Page,
he would go to Townsend,

32:41.042 --> 32:44.712
get him to agree to stop hunting her
and she activates the chip. It's a trap.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.965
She's leading Townsend to you.

32:50.635 --> 32:51.928
It's about time.

32:52.637 --> 32:54.555
[Liz] Yes, it is.

33:00.478 --> 33:01.479
[beeps]

33:03.481 --> 33:05.775
The chip's live. We've got a signal.

33:06.734 --> 33:08.444
Very smart girl.

33:08.528 --> 33:11.739
Start making calls,
to Dembe, Gerard, anyone.

33:11.823 --> 33:14.742
Somebody reach Reddington,
tell him his life's in danger.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.498
Make a left at the light.

33:21.416 --> 33:22.834
Are you sure about this?

33:23.543 --> 33:26.671
This means giving up on Reddington
watching Keen die.

33:27.463 --> 33:28.715
That was my dream.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.218
This is my reality.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.346
Edward is standing by.

33:36.681 --> 33:37.890
Edward?

33:38.683 --> 33:40.268
Are we flying somewhere?

33:41.436 --> 33:45.606
Hold on. They've stopped,
about a half a mile to our west.

33:46.232 --> 33:47.608
I'll call in a team.

33:54.407 --> 33:57.201
Upstairs, now. We need to talk.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.830
Two units inbound,
less than ten minutes away.

34:01.748 --> 34:03.458
-Sir, you hear me?
-Stop.

34:03.541 --> 34:06.919
-Sir?
-Stop! They're coming toward us, fast.

34:07.003 --> 34:09.464
Like, impossibly fast.

34:17.430 --> 34:18.431
[sighs]

34:19.599 --> 34:22.268
Sparkling water?
That's what you take with the truth?

34:22.351 --> 34:25.855
I must say, I highly recommend
a martini, three olives.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.447
[pensive music playing]

34:34.530 --> 34:36.741
[Cooper] We have
one of Townsend's associates.

34:36.824 --> 34:42.038
He claims Keen has some tracking chip,
that she's leading Townsend to Reddington.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.290
Not only is Miss Keen
a criminal and a fugitive,

34:44.373 --> 34:46.167
now she's gonna murder our CI?

34:46.250 --> 34:47.919
We're trying to contact him.

34:48.002 --> 34:51.422
This makes me feel better
about the DOJ's directive.

34:51.506 --> 34:54.217
Directive. What directive?

34:54.300 --> 34:56.719
The one I came here to tell you about.

34:57.637 --> 35:01.641
They just issued a burn notice on Keen.
They want her scrubbed.

35:01.724 --> 35:04.685
"Scrubbed"? What does that mean?
"Killed" scrubbed?

35:04.769 --> 35:08.356
It means eliminated.
Knowing too much is one thing,

35:08.439 --> 35:11.943
but she now demonstrates
an obvious liability to the Bureau.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.237
-We can bring her in.
-No, you can't.

35:14.320 --> 35:17.907
Soon as Keen's handled, the DOJ will
disavow all knowledge of the task force,

35:17.990 --> 35:19.492
kick Reddington free--

35:19.575 --> 35:21.119
They can't do that.

35:21.202 --> 35:23.579
You never existed.

35:27.416 --> 35:30.419
Cynthia... we can bring her in.

35:30.503 --> 35:32.630
Someone's gonna bring our girl in,

35:32.713 --> 35:36.551
and when they do, it's gonna be
curtain call on this program.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.776
-Good morning.
-Where are we?

35:56.904 --> 36:00.616
It's been what, eight, nine hours?
Where are you taking me?

36:00.700 --> 36:04.787
A friend once told me
that the true measure of a man

36:04.871 --> 36:09.917
isn't what he reveals to the world
but what he hides from it.

36:12.336 --> 36:13.171
Perhaps.

36:14.046 --> 36:17.675
Keeping secrets is brutal business.

36:18.217 --> 36:19.760
Twenty minutes to Riga.

36:20.386 --> 36:21.846
We're going to Latvia?

36:23.014 --> 36:23.890
For what?

36:24.599 --> 36:25.683
For answers.

36:42.283 --> 36:43.117
How?

36:45.703 --> 36:47.205
The night of the fire.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.920
There are no words to describe...

36:56.214 --> 36:57.882
how it felt to...

36:59.467 --> 37:01.928
see you in such pain.

37:06.057 --> 37:10.811
That... scar is a permanent reminder of...

37:12.772 --> 37:17.151
how the choices we made
have affected your life forever.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.819
The choices who made?

37:19.445 --> 37:21.364
Its shape was so...

37:22.198 --> 37:26.410
clear in my memory,
as if I'd seen it before.

37:27.578 --> 37:30.831
And then, one day, there it was on a map.

37:31.415 --> 37:34.126
Not a perfect match, but eerily close.

37:35.127 --> 37:36.170
It became...

37:38.381 --> 37:39.840
the symbol of...

37:41.884 --> 37:46.389
the most important aspect
of my business and image,

37:46.472 --> 37:49.725
representing the danger you faced

37:49.809 --> 37:53.646
and the promise to protect you from it.

37:59.652 --> 38:01.737
And this is where it all began...

38:03.739 --> 38:06.701
along the banks of the sea it resembles.

38:11.372 --> 38:12.915
What's in Latvia?

38:29.515 --> 38:30.725
What is this place?

38:31.309 --> 38:34.353
The Baltic's best seafood distributor.

38:34.437 --> 38:36.856
Why do I feel like
that's not at all what this is?

38:36.939 --> 38:39.317
Because that's not at all what this is.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.068
-It's a front.
-A front for what?

38:41.152 --> 38:45.197
Mr. Reddington, hello, my friend.
I hope you had an easy flight.

38:45.281 --> 38:48.326
Yes, thank you, Juris. We did.
It's good to see you.

38:48.409 --> 38:51.787
Good to see you, sir.
And Miss Keen, it's an honor.

38:55.666 --> 38:58.336
[pensive music playing]

39:04.550 --> 39:06.135
You said it hurt...

39:08.095 --> 39:11.766
to see me in so much pain
the night of the fire.

39:12.600 --> 39:13.809
Why were you there?

39:14.894 --> 39:17.605
-The Fulcrum.
-My mother went to find it,

39:17.688 --> 39:21.442
to confront my father,
but she wasn't alone.

39:22.276 --> 39:23.569
There were others.

39:23.652 --> 39:27.740
Is that why you were there?
Did you work with my mother?

39:28.908 --> 39:32.453
Elizabeth, I knew your mother
better than she knew herself.

39:56.477 --> 39:57.520
What is this?

40:00.398 --> 40:01.399
The epicenter.

40:03.943 --> 40:06.737
I brought you here
because this is where it all started.

40:07.446 --> 40:08.614
Where what started?

40:10.741 --> 40:11.826
You want answers.

40:14.078 --> 40:16.372
Let's start with one you already know.

40:20.209 --> 40:22.169
The identity of N-13.

40:23.379 --> 40:25.923
-I was right.
-About some of it.

40:26.465 --> 40:32.888
The story you've heard is that N-13 stole
13 packets of intelligence from the KGB

40:32.972 --> 40:35.724
around the time the Soviet Union fell.

40:35.808 --> 40:37.518
You were N-13.

40:38.561 --> 40:40.187
You are N-13.

40:40.271 --> 40:41.272
Yes.

40:41.814 --> 40:43.524
But I didn't steal anything.

40:44.066 --> 40:46.402
The Sikorsky Archive was a gift.

40:46.485 --> 40:47.319
Gift?

40:48.863 --> 40:51.282
A blackmail file with compromising intel

40:51.365 --> 40:54.076
on the world's most powerful people
and corporations?

40:54.160 --> 40:55.161
And governments.

40:55.244 --> 40:56.370
Who would do that?

40:56.454 --> 40:59.498
One of your mother's
closest friends and colleagues.

41:02.251 --> 41:03.294
You're lying.

41:04.545 --> 41:06.172
You framed my mother,

41:06.255 --> 41:08.924
made the world believe
she stole the archive.

41:09.008 --> 41:11.385
You need to forget
what you think you know.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.720
You set her up.

41:12.803 --> 41:15.306
Elizabeth, listen to me.

41:17.057 --> 41:22.062
Katarina Rostova
was never framed or killed.

41:23.397 --> 41:26.942
The Sikorsky Archive was a seed,

41:27.651 --> 41:29.737
the beginning of what would become

41:29.820 --> 41:34.575
one of the most sophisticated
intelligence networks in existence.

41:35.367 --> 41:40.623
A network meticulously crafted
with her knowledge and blessing,

41:40.706 --> 41:44.043
to serve one guiding purpose:

41:44.543 --> 41:50.257
To give me the power
to keep you safe and your mother hidden.

41:52.676 --> 41:57.431
