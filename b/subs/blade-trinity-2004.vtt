00:34.952 --> 00:36.662
<i>In the movies, Dracula wears a cape...</i>

00:36.870 --> 00:39.456
<i>...and some old English guy
always manages to save the day...</i>

00:39.665 --> 00:42.251
<i>...at the last minute
with crosses and holy water.</i>

00:42.960 --> 00:45.921
<i>But everybody knows
the movies are full of shit.</i>

00:46.547 --> 00:50.926
<i>The truth is it started with Blade,
and it ended with him.</i>

00:51.134 --> 00:53.929
<i>The rest of us were just
along for the ride.</i>

03:03.475 --> 03:05.352
What's this chicken scratch?

03:05.560 --> 03:07.521
It's cuneiform.

03:07.729 --> 03:10.065
It's about 4000 years old.

03:10.774 --> 03:14.903
- So why here?
- Because this is the cradle of civilization.

03:16.405 --> 03:18.782
He would have been comfortable here.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.326
I don't know, Dan.
This seems like another dead end.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.746
- There's something beneath us.
- You find a watch?

03:27.791 --> 03:29.251
Is it a body?

03:33.422 --> 03:34.798
Guys?

03:41.847 --> 03:42.889
Go.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.351
What the fuck? Motherfucker!

04:06.288 --> 04:10.417
Tonight, Dr. Edgar Vance,
forensic psychiatrist...

04:10.584 --> 04:14.504
...and author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller:

04:14.671 --> 04:18.632
<i>Human Health: The Whole
Being Breakthrough.</i>

04:18.800 --> 04:22.512
Also with us, Martin Vreede, chief of police.

04:22.679 --> 04:26.016
They'll be here for the next hour,
and they'll be taking your calls...

04:26.183 --> 04:30.020
...next on <i>Bentley Tittle Live</i>.

04:31.146 --> 04:36.610
Okay, Dr. Vance, you are
a psychiatrist and a biochemist...

04:36.777 --> 04:38.069
...isn't that true?

04:38.236 --> 04:40.363
Yes, uh, Bentley, I am both.

04:40.530 --> 04:46.328
And it's for a reason. I have always believed
that true health can only be achieved...

04:46.495 --> 04:49.539
...if we reconcile the body and the mind.

04:49.706 --> 04:53.710
And, of course, in order to do that,
we have to get rid of a lot of old notions.

04:53.877 --> 04:57.172
Okay, and how does
that fit in with vampires?

04:57.339 --> 05:04.137
Uh, in the case of vampires, we're dealing
with creatures that are the repositories...

05:04.304 --> 05:06.723
...of some of our most taboo thoughts.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.433
- Okay.
- Predatory rage.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.435
- Yeah.
- Sexual sadism.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.771
- Sexual?
- Sexual sadism.

05:12.938 --> 05:16.691
These are very scary subjects for people
to own up to, and they're right inside.

05:16.858 --> 05:20.987
So, what you're saying is we pass
the buck onto someone else.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.199
- You bet we do.
- And vampires...?

05:24.366 --> 05:26.827
Well, for instance, there's
a hereditary blood disease.

05:26.993 --> 05:29.287
I talk about it in my book,
it's called porphyria.

05:29.454 --> 05:35.544
And the symptoms of this disease are
remarkably similar to classic vampire traits.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.380
The people who suffer from
this disease are anemic.

05:38.547 --> 05:43.134
They become intolerant to sunlight.
They can't handle garlic.

05:43.301 --> 05:47.013
Garlic? Chief Vreede, okay,
what's your take on all these rumors...

05:47.180 --> 05:50.809
...we've been hearing about vampires?
Vampires. Vampires! What?

05:50.976 --> 05:56.022
The only vampires I'm worried about are
the ones passing the bar exam. Ha-ha-ha.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.067
Ahem.

05:59.234 --> 06:03.697
Seriously though, if vampires existed,
don't you think we would've found them by now?

06:03.864 --> 06:06.700
The truth is, our streets
have never been safer.

06:06.867 --> 06:10.412
Homicides, assaults, violent crime
is down across the board.

06:10.579 --> 06:12.289
People wanna be concerned...

06:12.455 --> 06:15.333
...they should focus in on characters
like this Blade criminal.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.835
That's the guy I wanna hear about.

06:17.002 --> 06:19.462
I wanna hear about this character Blade.
What about him?

06:19.629 --> 06:21.923
He's a sociopath that
we've been pursuing.

06:22.090 --> 06:25.468
Blade is a troubled individual.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.888
I understand that he is
under the impression...

06:28.054 --> 06:30.265
...that there is a vast
conspiracy of vampires.

06:30.432 --> 06:31.933
Heh, heh. Yeah.

06:32.100 --> 06:36.646
You've got to look at the psychiatric
underpinnings of a belief like that.

06:37.272 --> 06:42.360
Odds are, he believes that he is
out there slaying monsters.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.529
- Mm-hm.
- But what he's really doing...

06:44.696 --> 06:47.073
...is trying to kill aspects of himself.

08:25.088 --> 08:26.589
I'm on the Stonebridge overpass.

08:26.798 --> 08:29.134
Got it. Heading westbound.
I'm just beneath you.

08:30.468 --> 08:31.761
Go.

10:45.103 --> 10:46.187
Come on!

10:47.856 --> 10:49.691
I got him. Pull!

10:50.525 --> 10:51.818
You all right, man?

11:09.878 --> 11:11.004
He's got a gun!

11:25.602 --> 11:27.353
- Oh, my God!
- Aah!

11:42.744 --> 11:44.746
Staked you with silver.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.540
Why aren't you ash?

11:47.749 --> 11:49.918
Why aren't you smarter?

11:50.960 --> 11:53.421
Not a vampire, dumb shit!

11:59.010 --> 12:01.054
Set your sorry ass up.

12:13.650 --> 12:14.651
Hm.

12:19.614 --> 12:20.949
Damn.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.436
Oh, Blade.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.350
What the fuck happened tonight?

13:32.270 --> 13:33.896
How should I know?

13:34.814 --> 13:36.190
He was human.

13:36.983 --> 13:40.111
You're getting reckless, Blade.
Killing vampires is clean.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.906
They ash, don't leave
any evidence behind.

13:44.115 --> 13:45.450
Killing humans is messy.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.493
You better hope nobody ID'd you.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.580
This worked really good.

13:54.751 --> 13:58.254
- What's this?
- A new delivery system for your serum.

13:58.463 --> 14:00.298
It's an effervescent inhaler.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.216
Just bite down on the mouth guard.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.344
Delivery's automatic.

14:04.552 --> 14:05.970
Some friends of mine made it.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.222
Hm. Friends?

14:08.431 --> 14:11.059
Yeah. You remember those?

14:11.684 --> 14:14.062
<i>It was horrible. The one car crashed...</i>

14:14.270 --> 14:16.230
<i>...then the guy in the coat
shot the other guy.</i>

14:16.439 --> 14:18.608
<i>- It looked like there was a lot of blood.
- Thank you.</i>

14:18.816 --> 14:20.860
<i>That was just a taste
of the mayhem that occurred...</i>

14:21.069 --> 14:24.947
<i>...during tonight's brazen shootout
that left at least four people dead.</i>

14:25.114 --> 14:28.743
<i>Now, apparently, an anonymous citizen
captured the whole event on video.</i>

14:28.951 --> 14:30.661
Hey, Ray. Hey, we got a lead.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.163
Let's catch a plane, Wilson.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.915
Time to take these cowboys down.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.751
That's what I'm talking about.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.036
What's he been doing?

15:12.245 --> 15:13.746
Fuck-all. Just feeding.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.456
Been through five of them so far.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.041
You think we have enough security?

15:17.250 --> 15:20.294
We didn't capture him,
he allowed us to take him in.

15:20.503 --> 15:22.922
You understand? I'm gonna go in.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.368
You shouldn't have woken me.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.579
We had to.

16:41.459 --> 16:45.588
Your blood, your sacrament,
can set us free now.

16:46.881 --> 16:49.050
What makes you think I care?

16:49.258 --> 16:50.384
Your people need you.

16:50.593 --> 16:51.844
My people?

16:55.306 --> 16:58.935
You're nothing but shadows
of your former selves.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.395
Look how far you have fallen.

17:01.604 --> 17:03.648
The world's changed since your time.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.525
The humans have a new hunter.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.528
Blade.

17:08.736 --> 17:11.656
And you'd like me to kill him, wouldn't you?

17:12.156 --> 17:13.616
Yes.

17:16.243 --> 17:17.703
<i>You can't fight the curse</i>

17:17.869 --> 17:18.871
<i>You can't call the doctor</i>

17:31.217 --> 17:32.593
<i>With the thirsty love guzzler</i>

17:32.760 --> 17:35.263
<i>From the dark side, baby
Don't be afraid</i>

17:35.429 --> 17:36.973
<i>You can't fight the thirst</i>

17:41.852 --> 17:43.729
Subject is heading west.

17:43.938 --> 17:44.981
Got him.

17:47.858 --> 17:50.361
Congratulations. You're famous.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.862
Somebody nailed us.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.574
Your face is all over
the papers and television.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.367
Media's eating it up.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.035
- Like I care.
- Well, you should.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.956
Something like this,
taking out a human...

18:02.164 --> 18:04.709
...as far as the rest
of the world is concerned...

18:04.917 --> 18:06.961
...you're public enemy number one.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.922
Didn't know this was
a popularity contest.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.676
Damn it, Blade, don't you
see what they're doing?

18:13.884 --> 18:16.846
They're waging a goddamn P.R. campaign.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.099
Now it's not just vampires
we gotta worry about...

18:20.308 --> 18:23.561
...we're gonna have to take on
the rest of the world too.

18:25.062 --> 18:28.232
You worry too much, old man.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.735
It's why we're still alive, goddamn it.

18:31.402 --> 18:34.155
I've been doing this since before
you were born, Blade.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.073
You're like a son to me.

18:36.741 --> 18:38.868
I'm sorry I got old on you.

18:39.076 --> 18:42.121
I see you alone, surrounded by enemies.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.165
And it breaks my heart.

18:45.708 --> 18:48.252
We can't win this war alone.

18:53.090 --> 18:57.261
Look at it. He just gave me the evil eye.
Come on, man. What about that guy?

19:00.723 --> 19:06.437
- Prostitute, baby. Whoo-hoo!
- Come on! Quit fucking around!

19:06.604 --> 19:09.106
I'm hungry and I want to eat somebody.

19:10.107 --> 19:14.111
- What about him?
- No fatties. They taste like Cheetos.

19:16.447 --> 19:17.948
I don't know. I like him.

19:18.491 --> 19:22.912
Wait. What about that?
Shrunken apple-headed bitch.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.538
That fucking sorry ass over there.

19:24.705 --> 19:28.876
Fucking blow me, man!
Just pick one already. Jesus Christ!

19:29.210 --> 19:31.587
Oh, got it! Got it!

19:32.046 --> 19:33.214
Baby on board.

19:33.422 --> 19:37.176
Oh, looks like we got
ourselves a combo meal!

19:52.024 --> 19:54.735
Chickie, chickie, chickie.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.327
Oh, yeah, baby!

20:45.536 --> 20:47.329
What's for dinner?

21:00.301 --> 21:01.594
Heh, heh. Hey, pretty lady.

21:09.185 --> 21:11.395
No! No!

21:12.730 --> 21:13.731
No!

21:16.984 --> 21:18.986
Scream if this hurts, <i>chica</i>.

21:21.489 --> 21:23.449
- Ha, ha, ha!
- Aah!

21:24.450 --> 21:25.910
"Fuck you"?

21:29.163 --> 21:30.372
Garlic!

21:57.441 --> 21:58.692
Come on!

22:33.185 --> 22:35.354
Scream if this hurts, <i>chica</i>.

23:44.173 --> 23:45.215
What is it?

23:46.675 --> 23:48.177
What you were worried about.

24:05.527 --> 24:06.862
Let's go, let's go!

24:10.991 --> 24:12.785
<i>Shoot to kill!</i>

25:46.170 --> 25:47.838
Move a finger, and you're dead.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.631
How's about this one?

25:49.840 --> 25:51.091
He's got something in his hand!

25:51.300 --> 25:52.509
Get out, Blade!

25:58.599 --> 26:00.100
Shit!

26:15.449 --> 26:16.867
What's going on in there?

26:17.076 --> 26:18.368
Somebody talk to me!

26:32.758 --> 26:33.967
Hold it right there!

26:34.176 --> 26:35.427
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

27:22.182 --> 27:25.144
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

27:29.857 --> 27:33.068
Special agents Ray Cumberland,
Wilson Hale. FBI.

27:33.277 --> 27:35.696
We've been tracking you a long time.

27:36.405 --> 27:37.823
Whistler.

27:38.031 --> 27:39.241
Dead.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.703
Just like all your victims.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.081
How many people have you killed, Blade?

27:46.290 --> 27:48.625
Thirty? Forty? Fifty?

27:49.918 --> 27:52.171
1182.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.340
But they were all familiars.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.384
People who work with them.

27:57.593 --> 28:01.471
Oh. And by "them,"
you mean vampires, right?

28:01.638 --> 28:03.974
So how do you kill these
bloodsuckers, tough guy?

28:04.141 --> 28:05.684
Maybe you can give us some pointers.

28:05.851 --> 28:07.895
- You can stake them, right?
- What about sunlight?

28:08.061 --> 28:11.106
- They ain't feeling sunlight right?
- What about crosses? Do they still work?

28:11.273 --> 28:13.108
- In this day and age?
- I don't know, Ray.

28:13.275 --> 28:15.861
What if Mr. Homey Vampire's like Jewish?

28:16.028 --> 28:19.114
- Ha, ha. That's a good point.
- Heh, heh.

28:19.281 --> 28:22.451
And what about garlic?
Does that work on Hindu vampires?

28:22.618 --> 28:24.995
Or do you need like saffron or some shit?

28:26.538 --> 28:28.498
- That was quick.
- Thank you.

28:33.378 --> 28:36.340
You can keep doing your song and
dance as long as you want, Blade.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.258
It's not gonna play.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.427
We know what you are.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.262
You're a stone-cold killer.

28:42.471 --> 28:44.181
And you're sick as fuck.

28:44.389 --> 28:46.808
Let's leave the diagnosis
to the professionals.

28:48.352 --> 28:49.686
Hello, Blade.

28:50.270 --> 28:51.438
My name is Dr. Vance.

28:51.647 --> 28:55.442
I've been charged with giving
you a psychiatric evaluation.

28:56.318 --> 28:59.780
Gentlemen, would you mind giving us
just a couple of minutes alone?

29:00.405 --> 29:01.782
He's all yours.

29:16.380 --> 29:19.007
I know you must find
this very frightening...

29:20.217 --> 29:22.803
...but I want you to know
that I'm here to help.

29:23.679 --> 29:25.472
And in order for me to do that...

29:25.722 --> 29:27.808
...I'm gonna have to ask you
a couple of questions.

29:28.642 --> 29:30.310
Okay?

29:31.228 --> 29:36.233
Heh. You know, Blade, the darnedest thing.
I was signing in at Security...

29:36.400 --> 29:39.611
...and couldn't remember the date.

29:40.821 --> 29:42.990
Do you know what day it is?

29:47.327 --> 29:48.996
How about the president?

29:49.746 --> 29:51.331
You know who that is?

29:51.873 --> 29:53.542
Who's in the White House right now?

29:53.709 --> 29:55.377
An asshole.

29:58.922 --> 30:02.217
I think somebody here wants
to talk about vampires.

30:04.594 --> 30:06.179
Vampires.

30:09.391 --> 30:11.852
For everyone else, it's kind of silly.

30:13.603 --> 30:16.606
I had a set of wax teeth
when I was 7 years old.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.610
It was fun.

30:21.611 --> 30:23.113
I could be somebody else.

30:24.573 --> 30:27.784
But I wanna hear you talk
about vampires.

30:28.994 --> 30:30.746
What can you tell me about them?

30:32.914 --> 30:34.624
They exist.

30:36.084 --> 30:37.627
Are you one of them?

30:40.922 --> 30:45.635
Sometimes the scariest monster of all...

30:45.802 --> 30:47.888
...is the one in the mirror.

30:52.726 --> 30:54.853
Tell me about blood.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.772
When you drink blood...

30:57.606 --> 30:59.858
...do you ever feel sexually aroused?

31:04.279 --> 31:08.241
It just strikes me that this
business of vampirism...

31:08.408 --> 31:14.539
...has a very strong element
of sexual confusion.

31:16.166 --> 31:18.627
Nuzzling into someone's neck.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.505
A nocturnal visit...

31:22.172 --> 31:27.260
...with promises of delicious
physical intimacy.

31:30.680 --> 31:33.517
The very sweet taste of saliva...

31:34.184 --> 31:36.061
...mixed with skin.

31:37.145 --> 31:40.273
Oh. Sounds good to me.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.110
But where's it come from?

31:43.402 --> 31:45.028
That's what I wanna know.

31:46.488 --> 31:51.451
And I'm starting to wonder what your
relationship with your mother was like.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.248
Were the two of you very close?

32:04.131 --> 32:05.257
He's psychotic.

32:05.465 --> 32:07.426
- No shit.
- For his safety and for the public's...

32:07.634 --> 32:10.011
...I'm recommending he be
transferred to County Psychiatric...

32:10.220 --> 32:11.680
Fuck that! That man is my prisoner.

32:11.888 --> 32:14.141
He's wanted in connection
with a laundry list of crimes.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.309
Hold on, gentlemen.
We're in my jurisdiction now.

32:16.518 --> 32:18.979
Got a problem with that,
you talk to the local magistrate.

32:19.187 --> 32:21.857
That man is my prisoner!
Don't fuck with my thing!

32:22.065 --> 32:24.860
There's a team from the hospital
effecting the transfer immediately.

32:25.068 --> 32:27.070
You're supposed to be
working with us, chief.

32:27.237 --> 32:28.447
Not this time.

32:33.577 --> 32:37.372
This is just a little something
to keep you compliant.

32:39.291 --> 32:42.377
The usual dose for this sort
of thing is 200, 300 milligrams...

32:42.586 --> 32:47.466
...but I think with a big,
strapping hybrid like yourself...

32:47.674 --> 32:50.093
...I'll kick it up to a couple thousand.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.679
You don't have a problem
with needles, do you?

32:55.223 --> 32:56.475
There.

32:56.683 --> 32:58.018
That wasn't so bad, was it?

33:00.187 --> 33:02.063
Ooh. You're weak.

33:02.856 --> 33:04.733
In need of your serum.

33:05.859 --> 33:07.486
That must be a bad feeling.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.323
I mean, who would've imagined...

33:11.531 --> 33:14.576
...that a mere human like me
could have overpowered you.

33:17.287 --> 33:19.331
You're one of them.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.334
A familiar.

33:26.254 --> 33:28.340
Going on five years now.

33:32.093 --> 33:34.137
It's the endgame, Blade.

33:34.721 --> 33:37.224
All their plans are coming to fruition.

33:37.974 --> 33:41.853
Why don't you just sit back
and enjoy the show?

33:49.194 --> 33:53.031
I hate familiars.

34:02.582 --> 34:05.418
<i>It's why we're still alive, goddamn it.</i>

34:05.710 --> 34:08.004
<i>You're like a son to me.</i>

34:10.257 --> 34:14.553
<i>I'm sorry I got old on you.</i>

34:15.762 --> 34:20.058
<i>I see you alone, surrounded by enemies.</i>

34:20.266 --> 34:22.185
<i>It breaks my heart.</i>

34:48.503 --> 34:49.629
Hi, Blade.

34:49.838 --> 34:51.505
So glad to finally meet you.

34:51.715 --> 34:53.550
I am such a fan.

34:54.884 --> 34:57.012
I like your tattoos.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.306
Do they mean anything?

35:00.640 --> 35:01.891
Stupid.

35:02.517 --> 35:04.102
Are you okay?

35:04.311 --> 35:05.979
Are you tired?

35:07.981 --> 35:09.774
You're weak.

35:13.570 --> 35:16.448
We moved the humans around.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.742
Like pawns.

35:19.868 --> 35:21.286
We used them...

35:22.120 --> 35:23.705
...to flush you out.

35:33.048 --> 35:34.591
You're not so big.

35:36.551 --> 35:38.470
You're all alone, Blade.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.598
No one's gonna help you now.

36:02.827 --> 36:05.163
- Evening, ladies.
- Hannibal King!

36:09.292 --> 36:10.627
Wake up. This is your rescue.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.343
Go!

37:47.932 --> 37:49.267
Freeze!

38:03.406 --> 38:04.491
Whistler!

38:05.700 --> 38:07.035
This way!

38:15.627 --> 38:18.379
Blade! You're dead!

38:19.631 --> 38:20.965
Get down!

38:27.680 --> 38:28.723
Blade.

38:36.397 --> 38:37.524
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:37.690 --> 38:40.360
Where are you going?
Where the fuck is he going?

38:40.568 --> 38:42.654
This is supposed to be a rescue!

38:48.993 --> 38:50.036
Get back, get back!

38:53.248 --> 38:55.458
- We're pinned down.
- I can't shoot around corners.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.168
I can.

40:00.064 --> 40:02.233
Okay. We're fucked.

40:02.442 --> 40:03.526
We're fine.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.292
Forgot my sword.

40:22.921 --> 40:25.048
<i>We are soldiers, after all</i>

40:25.214 --> 40:27.842
<i>Down by honor we won't fall
After all</i>

40:28.009 --> 40:29.344
Whoo!

40:29.510 --> 40:31.012
Come on!

40:31.179 --> 40:32.180
<i>Comin' out the back end</i>

40:32.347 --> 40:34.724
<i>Dead at you
He throwin' that hot lead at you</i>

40:34.891 --> 40:37.352
<i>Swang affiliate, XO sip, a gold getter</i>

40:37.518 --> 40:39.354
<i>With the rest together
I'm a cold killer</i>

40:39.520 --> 40:41.648
<i>It's "Me Against the World" like 2Pac</i>

40:41.814 --> 40:44.400
<i>And like Biggie
I'm "Ready to Die" for what you got</i>

40:44.567 --> 40:45.735
Abby.

40:52.742 --> 40:53.868
We got him.

40:54.077 --> 40:55.578
We'll be there soon.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.413
Who the hell are you people?

40:57.622 --> 41:00.291
Well, my name is Hannibal King.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.794
And this little hellion
right here is Abigail.

41:03.336 --> 41:04.712
Whistler's daughter.

41:17.266 --> 41:19.852
I thought the vampires
killed Whistler's family.

41:20.061 --> 41:23.481
They did. I was born
later out of wedlock.

41:25.650 --> 41:29.278
When I came of age, I tracked my dad
down, and I told him I wanted in.

41:29.779 --> 41:31.948
Been doing it ever since.

41:38.663 --> 41:40.707
Welcome to the honeycomb hideout.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.710
How do you bankroll this operation?

41:43.918 --> 41:45.336
I date a lot of older men.

41:46.754 --> 41:48.673
Come on, man, I'm joking.

41:48.881 --> 41:50.425
You met Dex.

41:50.633 --> 41:51.843
This is Hedges.

41:52.051 --> 41:54.971
Sommerfield. She's the one who built
that new serum inhaler of yours.

41:55.179 --> 41:59.934
That runt you saw earlier,
that was Sommerfield's daughter. Zoe.

42:01.769 --> 42:03.896
We call ourselves the Nightstalkers.

42:04.689 --> 42:08.026
Hm. Sounds like rejects from
a Saturday morning cartoon.

42:08.234 --> 42:11.904
We were gonna go with the Care Bears,
but that was taken.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.827
- How many of you are there?
- There's enough.

42:18.036 --> 42:19.579
We operate in sleeper cells.

42:19.787 --> 42:22.415
When one goes down, another cell
activates to pick up the slack.

42:22.623 --> 42:24.959
Consider us your reinforcements.

42:26.335 --> 42:28.671
What, you amateurs are
supposed to be helping me?

42:30.381 --> 42:32.383
Heh. You?

42:33.468 --> 42:34.761
Look at you.

42:34.969 --> 42:36.179
You're kids.

42:37.013 --> 42:38.556
You're not ready to roll with this.

42:39.182 --> 42:41.059
I mean, look at the way you're dressed.

42:42.143 --> 42:43.895
What, that's supposed to be tactical?

42:44.812 --> 42:48.524
What is this? What is that?
"Fuck you." It's a joke, huh?

42:49.275 --> 42:52.403
What the fuck is wrong with y'all?
Y'all think this is a joke?

42:52.612 --> 42:57.325
- You think this is a fucking sitcom?
- Okay, first off, that's just rude.

42:57.533 --> 43:01.287
Second, I'm pretty sure
we saved your ass back there.

43:03.456 --> 43:05.541
Mm. I'm impressed.

43:05.750 --> 43:08.753
Look, Blade, my father
meant for us to help you.

43:08.961 --> 43:11.798
Like it or not, we are all you got.

43:12.423 --> 43:15.093
What the hell makes you think you
know about hunting vampires?

43:15.301 --> 43:18.971
Well, here's for starters.

43:19.764 --> 43:21.057
I used to be one.

43:22.517 --> 43:23.976
Do I pass the audition?

43:25.812 --> 43:27.188
Rookies.

43:27.980 --> 43:30.274
Fucking Hannibal King!

43:30.483 --> 43:34.153
I should've ripped his bleeding
heart out when I had the chance!

43:41.911 --> 43:43.621
We had Blade.

43:43.830 --> 43:45.039
We had him!

43:47.125 --> 43:49.961
And don't tell me "I told you so," Asher.

43:50.169 --> 43:51.963
What's wrong, half-pint?
You need a timeout?

43:52.171 --> 43:53.172
Blow me.

43:54.715 --> 43:56.843
We got caught with our pants down.

43:57.051 --> 43:58.261
Pants down?

43:58.469 --> 44:01.514
They pretty much fucking ass-raped us.

44:01.722 --> 44:03.015
Oh, you loved it.

44:03.224 --> 44:04.809
Has he been told?

44:05.560 --> 44:07.478
About your failure?

44:08.604 --> 44:09.647
Yes.

44:11.566 --> 44:13.734
Maybe it's time I joined the game.

44:20.658 --> 44:23.995
You know the kind of woman
that just screams trouble?

44:24.704 --> 44:27.665
You see her, and every warning bell
in your brain starts going off...

44:27.874 --> 44:31.752
...but you still manage
to ask for her number.

44:31.961 --> 44:33.838
Well, that's all I ever hook up with.

44:34.046 --> 44:35.631
But this betty...

44:37.008 --> 44:41.012
...whoa, she blew them all away
in the shitstorm sweepstakes.

44:41.512 --> 44:43.181
Her name is Danica Talos.

44:43.389 --> 44:44.807
You met her earlier.

44:45.016 --> 44:48.394
And unlike typical vampires,
her fangs are located in her vagina.

44:51.272 --> 44:52.732
Moving on.

44:52.940 --> 44:55.735
The man on her left is her brother, Asher.

44:55.943 --> 44:59.363
And this walking diaper stain
is Jarko Grimwood.

44:59.572 --> 45:01.073
I picked Danica up in a bar...

45:01.282 --> 45:03.784
...and spent the next five years
playing hide-and-go-suck...

45:03.993 --> 45:05.912
...as her little vampire cabana boy.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.497
Eventually, Abigail found me.

45:08.706 --> 45:12.293
Sommerfield managed to treat me
with a cure, and now I kill them.

45:13.878 --> 45:16.631
And that's basically turning
a frown upside down.

45:18.549 --> 45:20.676
We need to pool our resources, Blade.

45:21.636 --> 45:22.678
"We"?

45:24.847 --> 45:26.182
Yeah, we.

45:26.974 --> 45:28.726
He's come back.

45:31.354 --> 45:32.688
Take a look at this.

45:37.985 --> 45:39.320
You gotta be kidding me.

45:46.827 --> 45:49.538
- Where'd you guys get this stuff?
- I stole most of it.

45:50.206 --> 45:53.042
Danica had a huge collection.
He had stone work...

45:53.209 --> 45:56.671
...iron work, weaponry, art.

45:58.256 --> 46:00.925
This stuff that shows up everywhere,
this symbol, this glyph.

46:01.092 --> 46:03.844
It's on everything in here.
He is real.

46:04.011 --> 46:07.348
You dig beneath all the myths,
all the layers of bullshit...

46:07.515 --> 46:09.850
...that have cluttered our culture
for the last 500 years...

46:10.017 --> 46:12.520
...and eventually, you're
gonna strike the truth.

46:13.396 --> 46:14.939
So the movies are true.

46:15.106 --> 46:19.151
The movies are just a comforting
fairytale compared to the real deal.

46:19.527 --> 46:21.404
Bram Stoker, he wrote a good yarn.

46:21.570 --> 46:27.076
But the events he described back in 1897...
God, that was just a tiny piece of the mosaic.

46:27.243 --> 46:32.873
The real Dracula, his origins,
date back much, much earlier than that.

46:33.207 --> 46:36.252
- How early?
- Try 6 or 7 thousand years.

46:37.378 --> 46:38.796
This is a piece of his armor.

46:38.963 --> 46:42.341
With it, we were able to extrapolate
a basic idea of what this fucker looked like.

46:42.550 --> 46:43.718
Check this out.

46:44.552 --> 46:47.013
Dracula's only one
of the names he's gone by.

46:47.221 --> 46:51.392
The Babylonians worshiped him as Dagon,
and now they call him Drake.

46:51.600 --> 46:54.895
If you believe in the legends,
he was born in ancient Sumeria.

47:03.404 --> 47:07.366
<i>Nobody really knows the specifics
of his origin, but we do know this:</i>

47:11.454 --> 47:12.788
He was the first of his kind.

47:13.914 --> 47:17.585
<i>The patriarch of</i> Hominus nocturna.

47:22.965 --> 47:25.426
<i>He was born perfect.</i>

47:28.429 --> 47:33.392
<i>And just like the great white shark,
this guy has never had to evolve.</i>

47:33.934 --> 47:35.478
<i>Forget the movies, forget the books.</i>

47:35.686 --> 47:37.313
<i>There's no happy ending with this guy.</i>

47:39.940 --> 47:42.026
<i>He's been there, moving
behind the scenes...</i>

47:42.234 --> 47:46.655
<i>...cutting a bloody fucking path
through the ages, until suddenly...</i>

47:49.075 --> 47:50.159
...just like that...

47:53.954 --> 47:56.165
...he up and disappeared.

47:56.374 --> 47:57.875
And then we heard a rumor.

47:58.084 --> 48:00.127
The vampires were searching for him.

48:00.336 --> 48:02.630
Some say he'd been sleeping
through the ages...

48:02.838 --> 48:05.800
...that he'd retreated from a world
he'd become disgusted with.

48:06.008 --> 48:10.054
And according to our information, they
found him in Iraq about six months ago.

48:10.262 --> 48:12.014
And he was pissed.

49:09.196 --> 49:11.323
In the window...

49:11.532 --> 49:13.742
You sell vampire merchandise?

49:15.578 --> 49:18.789
Uh, yeah. Look around.

49:18.998 --> 49:20.541
We might have a few things.

49:23.544 --> 49:25.129
We've got Dracula lunchboxes.

49:25.337 --> 49:26.547
Did you see those?

49:26.755 --> 49:30.676
There's bobbleheads, key chains.

49:30.843 --> 49:32.344
This is funny.

49:36.432 --> 49:39.059
<i>The garlic gets me every time.</i>

49:40.060 --> 49:42.688
We've got just about anything.

49:42.897 --> 49:45.774
Even vampire vibrators.

49:48.319 --> 49:50.654
Here, check this out.

49:52.781 --> 49:56.494
"Dracola." Makes you
wanna cry, doesn't it?

50:04.793 --> 50:07.671
Was there something special you needed?

50:09.507 --> 50:10.549
Hey, guy.

50:11.509 --> 50:12.927
She's talking to you.

50:20.809 --> 50:22.186
What?

50:22.394 --> 50:24.188
You wanna kiss me, pretty boy?

50:26.941 --> 50:28.108
No!

50:56.053 --> 50:59.098
- Why wake up Drake now?
- That's what we've been trying to figure out.

50:59.306 --> 51:00.516
When I was under the fang...

51:00.724 --> 51:04.603
...there used to be talk about
some kind of vampire final solution.

51:04.812 --> 51:07.273
Never figured out why they'd wanna
destroy their food source.

51:07.481 --> 51:08.649
That makes no sense, right?

51:08.857 --> 51:10.693
They've always had plans
for the human race.

51:10.901 --> 51:13.112
It seems likely that whatever
they're cooking up...

51:13.320 --> 51:15.823
...Drake's return is part of it.
Let's face it...

51:16.031 --> 51:17.992
...we are fighting a losing battle here.

51:18.200 --> 51:20.619
So we kill a few hundred
of them a year. Big deal.

51:20.828 --> 51:23.664
There are thousands of them out there,
maybe tens of thousands.

51:23.872 --> 51:24.957
We need a new tactic.

51:25.165 --> 51:26.208
Like what?

51:26.417 --> 51:27.876
A biological weapon.

51:29.545 --> 51:30.963
For you sighted people...

51:33.674 --> 51:35.676
...here's a little show-and-tell.

51:35.884 --> 51:38.470
For the last year, I've been
working with synthesized DNA...

51:38.679 --> 51:42.349
...in order to create an artificial virus
targeted specifically at vampires.

51:42.558 --> 51:44.518
We're calling it DayStar.

51:44.727 --> 51:46.270
Think about it, Blade.

51:46.979 --> 51:49.440
We could wipe them all out
in one single move.

51:49.648 --> 51:51.191
So, what's been holding you back?

51:51.400 --> 51:53.611
The lethality in vampires is still spotty.

51:53.819 --> 51:56.947
The bottom line is, we need a better
strand of DNA to work with.

51:57.781 --> 51:59.742
We need Dracula's blood.

51:59.950 --> 52:02.411
Because Dracula is the progenitor
of the vampire race...

52:02.620 --> 52:04.872
...his DNA is still pure.

52:05.080 --> 52:09.585
It hasn't been diluted by a hundred
generations of selective mutation.

52:09.793 --> 52:15.466
We get his blood, we can boost DayStar's
viral efficacy to 100 percent.

52:15.674 --> 52:17.718
All the vampires go bye-bye.

52:18.969 --> 52:21.847
So can we just go right ahead
and sign you up...

52:22.056 --> 52:24.183
...for one of our secret
Nightstalker decoder rings?

52:30.147 --> 52:31.899
Oh. Uh...

52:32.066 --> 52:35.361
Holy shit. Um... Gentlemen and hottie...

52:35.569 --> 52:38.280
...we have a wide assortment of ass-kickery...

52:38.489 --> 52:40.324
...for your viewing pleasure today.

52:40.532 --> 52:44.244
Electronic pistol.
Comes in a variety of tasty calibers.

52:45.204 --> 52:46.538
Explosive rounds.

52:46.747 --> 52:48.791
Yeah, but with a concentrated
burst of UV light...

52:48.999 --> 52:50.834
...instead of your standard hollow points.

52:51.043 --> 52:52.628
I call them sundogs.

52:52.836 --> 52:55.881
Hedges. Super Size me, sweetheart.

52:58.467 --> 53:00.761
This little peashooter,
it's a modified version...

53:00.969 --> 53:03.555
...of the Army's Objective
Individual Combat Weapon.

53:03.764 --> 53:05.349
Pick your poison: sundogs, stakes...

53:05.557 --> 53:06.975
...heat-seeking mini rockets.

53:07.184 --> 53:10.354
Basically, whatever gets you hard,
this puppy will pump them out.

53:10.562 --> 53:15.025
Course, it doesn't have
the range of a sword, but...

53:15.234 --> 53:18.696
Oh, God. Over here, we...

53:18.904 --> 53:22.449
We call this the UV Arc.

53:23.450 --> 53:27.621
Whoa. Sorry. The two points are
connected by a powerful UV laser...

53:27.830 --> 53:29.748
- Hedges, I'll take it from here.
- Yes.

53:31.375 --> 53:32.960
This bad boy is half as hot as the sun.

53:33.168 --> 53:36.380
It can cut through vampires
like a knife through butter.

53:36.588 --> 53:39.758
We're still trying to sort out fact
from fiction when it comes to Dracula.

53:39.967 --> 53:42.177
Turning into mist? Kind of doubt it.

53:42.386 --> 53:45.764
General shape-shifting? Maybe.

53:46.557 --> 53:49.059
Not into a bat or a wolf
or anything like that...

53:49.268 --> 53:53.063
...but another human,
with practice, could be possible.

53:54.022 --> 53:56.567
Because he wouldn't have
a traditional skeletal structure.

53:56.775 --> 53:59.945
Something more like a snake's,
with thousands of tiny bones...

54:00.154 --> 54:03.490
I have a... I have a question
about that, Hedges.

54:03.699 --> 54:05.409
Have you ever been laid?

54:06.285 --> 54:07.870
Many times.

54:08.078 --> 54:09.121
With ladies.

54:11.165 --> 54:12.583
Time for a little refresher.

54:13.417 --> 54:16.003
Weakest link in the vampire
chain of command...

54:16.211 --> 54:18.130
...has always been their familiars.

54:18.338 --> 54:20.466
Since the vampires can't
go out in the daylight...

54:20.674 --> 54:23.385
...they get the humans
to do all their dirty work.

54:23.594 --> 54:25.304
We bleed the wannabes...

54:26.096 --> 54:28.348
...sooner or later,
they'll take us right to the real.

54:28.974 --> 54:30.517
I got you some new wheels.

54:30.726 --> 54:32.144
You take care of it, now.

54:39.234 --> 54:40.486
She's making playlists.

54:41.445 --> 54:43.405
She likes to listen to MP3s
when she hunts.

54:43.614 --> 54:45.866
It's like her own internal
soundtrack, you know?

54:46.074 --> 54:49.995
Dark-core, trip hop, whatever
kids are listening to these days.

54:50.788 --> 54:53.582
Me, I'm more of a David
Hasselhoff fan, you know?

55:49.221 --> 55:51.682
Eventually, you know,
your head is gonna pop off.

55:51.890 --> 55:54.017
Fuck! No, no! Please! Please!

55:54.226 --> 55:55.352
Who's your handler?

55:55.561 --> 55:58.772
I don't know my fucking handler.
I swear. I swear!

55:58.981 --> 56:01.108
Oh, shit! Please! Please! Aah!

56:05.904 --> 56:07.447
Oh, it's you.

56:08.198 --> 56:09.241
I'll take that.

56:10.117 --> 56:12.619
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

56:16.748 --> 56:17.791
<i>Hello?</i>

56:18.000 --> 56:19.042
<i>Hello?</i>

56:20.711 --> 56:23.088
Hello, this is Dr. Vance.
You paged me.

56:23.380 --> 56:24.381
Heh.

56:24.548 --> 56:27.050
It's for you. Yeah, go ahead.

56:27.718 --> 56:28.719
Hello?

56:28.886 --> 56:30.470
Aah!

56:32.556 --> 56:34.182
You know, at some point, you, uh...

56:34.391 --> 56:36.643
You might wanna consider
sitting down with somebody.

56:36.852 --> 56:38.687
You know? Have a little share time.

56:38.896 --> 56:42.190
Kick back. Get in touch with your
inner child. That sort of thing.

56:42.399 --> 56:46.778
Also, just a thought, but you might wanna
consider blinking once in a while.

56:51.825 --> 56:55.829
I'm sorry, I, uh...
I ate a lot of sugar today.

57:13.055 --> 57:14.097
Hey.

57:14.306 --> 57:16.516
You just can't walk in here like that.
Unh!

57:24.441 --> 57:25.442
Excuse me, sir.

57:32.699 --> 57:33.951
Don't do that.

57:51.843 --> 57:54.596
- Where's Vance?
- I'm sorry, you can't see Dr. Vance now.

58:04.106 --> 58:05.273
Sit.

58:10.195 --> 58:11.405
Can I, uh...? Can I help you?

58:11.613 --> 58:13.573
Remember me? Time for payback.

58:13.782 --> 58:16.076
All right, Vance, what the hell do you know?

58:18.745 --> 58:21.039
Oh, Jesus. It's him.

58:21.248 --> 58:22.833
Abby, it's Drake!

58:38.515 --> 58:41.059
So you're the hunter they all fear.

58:41.268 --> 58:44.021
- I had a feeling about you.
- Just shoot him!

58:44.229 --> 58:45.605
Go ahead, Blade.

58:45.814 --> 58:46.982
Show me what you're made of.

01:00:18.824 --> 01:00:19.991
Oh, my God!

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.202
He got my baby! Aah!

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:25.122
No! My baby!

01:01:24.723 --> 01:01:26.808
Ah. Careful, Daywalker.

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:28.852
I've been told about you...

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.979
...your weakness for humans.

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:32.606
Why'd you kill Vance?

01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:34.941
He'd outlived his purpose.

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:36.818
He died a good death.

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:38.612
Quick, clean.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.572
I wouldn't know anything about that.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.115
You will.

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:46.578
How are you able to survive in sunlight?

01:01:46.786 --> 01:01:48.997
Haven't you read Stoker's fable?

01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:52.709
I was the first of the vampires.

01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:55.837
I am unique.

01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:58.840
- So that's why they brought you back.
- Of course.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:02.093
They believe through me
they could become Daywalkers.

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:09.017
Look at them down there.

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:12.020
Scurrying around like insects.

01:02:12.604 --> 01:02:16.149
They don't know anything about
honor or living by the sword...

01:02:16.358 --> 01:02:17.943
...not like you and I do.

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:21.905
Do you think they could ever grasp
what it means to be immortal?

01:02:22.113 --> 01:02:23.365
You're not immortal.

01:02:24.115 --> 01:02:27.744
I must have heard hundreds of you
rodents make the same claim.

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:31.206
Each one of them have tasted
the end of my sword.

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:33.250
Perhaps I will too, then...

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:36.920
...but I think it is more likely,
the next time we meet...

01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:39.422
...you fall before mine.

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:41.508
Catch!

01:03:00.318 --> 01:03:01.736
Cootchie-coo.

01:03:03.738 --> 01:03:06.408
Did you see that guy?
We're gonna lose, man. We're gonna...

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.702
Oh! God!

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:10.704
We're gonna fucking lose!

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:12.330
- Okay.
- Ugh.

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:15.375
What did the one lesbian
vampire say to the other?

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:20.171
- Shut up, King.
- See you in 28 days. Ha, ha!

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:23.633
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. What...?
What is that? What are you doing?

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.678
It's an elastic protein, okay?
It's gonna stop the hemorrhaging.

01:03:26.886 --> 01:03:29.055
Okay. Is it gonna hurt?

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:30.974
Yeah, it's gonna sting a little.

01:03:31.182 --> 01:03:32.600
Really? Unh.

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:38.189
Fuck me! Ow!

01:03:42.027 --> 01:03:43.862
<i>I had a family once.</i>

01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:46.948
Wife, two daughters.

01:03:51.286 --> 01:03:53.872
<i>Then a drifter came calling one evening.</i>

01:03:55.206 --> 01:03:56.249
A vampire.

01:03:57.792 --> 01:04:00.045
<i>He toyed with them first.</i>

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:05.675
Tried to make me decide
which order they'd die in.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.304
<i>I've been doing this a long time.</i>

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:11.556
Since before you were born.

01:04:12.932 --> 01:04:15.352
<i>I don't want this life for you, Abby.</i>

01:04:58.144 --> 01:04:59.354
Hey, Blade.

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:02.107
I got a question for you.

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:04.776
Say we're successful.
Say we wipe out all the vampires.

01:05:04.984 --> 01:05:06.528
What then, huh?

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:08.988
You ever ask yourself that?

01:05:10.281 --> 01:05:16.621
I mean, somehow, I don't picture you
teaching karate at the local Y.

01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:29.008
He hates me, doesn't he?

01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:30.343
Yeah.

01:05:41.187 --> 01:05:43.440
Why do you wear that symbol?

01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:49.112
Old habits.

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:54.868
I was a good Catholic school girl.

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:59.664
- Once.
- I was there when they crucified him.

01:06:02.584 --> 01:06:04.419
He died for their sins.

01:06:05.587 --> 01:06:06.629
Not mine.

01:06:08.047 --> 01:06:10.467
And what are your sins?

01:06:13.845 --> 01:06:15.597
Would you care to confess them?

01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:21.728
Take it off.

01:06:23.062 --> 01:06:24.564
Why?

01:06:25.398 --> 01:06:27.525
I will make you a better one.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.595
There's an old saying:

01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:01.643
"Kill one man, you're a murderer.

01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:05.647
Kill a million, a king.

01:07:07.649 --> 01:07:09.359
Kill them all...

01:07:10.401 --> 01:07:11.986
...a God."

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.972
Why do you do that?

01:07:39.847 --> 01:07:44.102
Because there's something
bad inside of me.

01:07:45.603 --> 01:07:47.522
This keeps it from getting out.

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:49.691
Why can't you just be nice?

01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:57.740
Because the world isn't nice.

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:04.998
<i>I found where the vampires are working.</i>

01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:07.417
Biomedica Enterprises.

01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:10.295
They've been buying up
all sorts of supplies.

01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:11.963
Check it out.

01:08:13.006 --> 01:08:14.632
Taq polymerase.

01:08:14.841 --> 01:08:17.551
Bone-marrow growth supplement.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.638
Genetic-sequencing enzymes.

01:08:20.805 --> 01:08:23.433
- Hm.
- You want a party favor?

01:08:24.058 --> 01:08:26.685
Lucky seven. Silver hollow points.

01:08:26.894 --> 01:08:28.229
Done.

01:08:57.841 --> 01:08:59.176
You wanted to see me?

01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:01.304
We've got trouble.

01:09:01.929 --> 01:09:04.140
Doing a little moonlighting, chief?

01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:05.683
Shit!

01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:18.904
What are you doing here?

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.448
Talk.

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.201
Talk.

01:09:26.953 --> 01:09:28.206
Spill it!

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:29.499
You know what we're doing.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.626
What's inside?

01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:42.095
Now, what's behind door number one?

01:09:44.221 --> 01:09:46.224
I can't tell you. They... They'll kill me.

01:09:46.432 --> 01:09:48.393
Kill you? Motherfucker, I'll kill you.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.103
I'll just enjoy it better.

01:09:58.444 --> 01:09:59.946
You know the routine.

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:18.005
Lights.

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:22.343
God in heaven.

01:10:38.317 --> 01:10:39.944
What is this place?

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:42.947
It's a blood-farming facility.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:53.166
Vampires decided that hunting
humans on a piecemeal basis was...

01:10:53.374 --> 01:10:54.667
...too inefficient.

01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:58.629
Why kill your prey when you
can keep them alive?

01:11:01.841 --> 01:11:03.926
Under optimal conditions,
a donor can generate...

01:11:04.135 --> 01:11:06.679
...anywhere from 50 to 100 pints of blood.

01:11:07.305 --> 01:11:08.973
Productive.

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:12.310
Where do you get all these people?

01:11:13.978 --> 01:11:16.731
They got processing centers
in every major city.

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:18.983
At any given time, there's what...

01:11:19.192 --> 01:11:22.779
...2, 3 million homeless
wandering around America?

01:11:22.987 --> 01:11:24.739
They just pull them in off the streets.

01:11:26.824 --> 01:11:28.659
Nobody cares about them.

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:32.246
We're doing this country a service, really.

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:37.251
Vampire final solution.

01:11:38.336 --> 01:11:40.296
Are they aware?

01:11:40.922 --> 01:11:42.465
Do they feel anything?

01:11:43.174 --> 01:11:45.343
They're in a chemical-induced coma.

01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:47.011
They're brain-dead.

01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:52.225
Look at this.

01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:54.477
This the future you want?

01:11:54.685 --> 01:11:59.065
Do you think that they have
a place for you in their future?

01:11:59.774 --> 01:12:01.400
We don't have a choice.

01:12:02.401 --> 01:12:04.904
They're going to win.
Can't you see that?

01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:06.531
He's come back!

01:12:06.739 --> 01:12:08.866
There's nothing stopping them now.

01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:10.576
There's me.

01:12:11.536 --> 01:12:12.954
Go.

01:12:14.205 --> 01:12:16.332
You got 20 seconds.

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:20.503
Twenty.

01:12:27.218 --> 01:12:29.387
Shutdown password, what is it?

01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:31.347
Harvest.

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:33.391
Put it in.

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:50.616
Let's go.

01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:05.965
Where'd you go?
See? I turned my back on you.

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:08.759
- You win.
- One more, one more.

01:13:08.968 --> 01:13:12.597
"Now, Nome King, having
never tried to be good...

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:15.474
...was very bad indeed.

01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:19.312
Having decided to conquer the land of Oz...

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:22.023
...and to destroy Emerald City..."

01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:25.276
<i>I get that paper and I'm chillin' on the low</i>

01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:27.862
<i>All I need is more money, more</i>

01:13:29.947 --> 01:13:32.909
- This ain't no video game.
- This ain't no video game.

01:13:34.702 --> 01:13:36.412
Oh!

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:38.039
Come on, now.

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:07.401
Dude, you're dead.

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:17.495
Mom, the lights are weird.

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:20.247
What do you mean?

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:21.916
They're going on and off.

01:14:25.336 --> 01:14:27.004
Guys?

01:14:28.506 --> 01:14:31.550
Zoe, I want you to go,
and I want you to hide, okay?

01:14:31.759 --> 01:14:34.178
Like we talked about. Go on.

01:15:11.424 --> 01:15:12.800
Zoe?

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:15.428
Get out of here, Zoe!

01:15:16.137 --> 01:15:19.265
Hide! God dammit, Zoe!

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:12.771
Something's not right.

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:19.320
King!

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:27.638
Zoe?

01:20:08.929 --> 01:20:10.264
Zoe.

01:20:11.223 --> 01:20:12.766
Zoe?

01:20:15.019 --> 01:20:16.186
Whistler.

01:21:32.471 --> 01:21:33.639
Use it.

01:21:36.475 --> 01:21:37.851
Use it.

01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:43.899
Use it.

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:06.713
Back off, pooch.

01:22:10.384 --> 01:22:12.803
Jesus Christ!

01:22:14.263 --> 01:22:15.764
What the fuck?

01:22:16.223 --> 01:22:19.017
- Good dog.
- What the fuck?

01:22:23.063 --> 01:22:25.190
His name's Pac-Man.

01:22:25.399 --> 01:22:29.153
We've been porting the vampire gene
into other species. Experimenting.

01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:33.240
You made a goddamn vampire Pomeranian?

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:36.034
Yeah.

01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:43.417
Precious, isn't he?

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:45.669
Well, that depends who you ask,
because clearly...

01:22:45.878 --> 01:22:47.880
...this dog has a bigger dick than you.

01:22:49.006 --> 01:22:52.968
And when the fuck did you
see my dick, fuck-face?

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:55.888
Ow!

01:22:56.054 --> 01:22:58.474
I was talking to her!

01:23:02.352 --> 01:23:04.188
Poor King.

01:23:05.105 --> 01:23:08.275
You look so distraught.

01:23:11.778 --> 01:23:14.156
- Unh!
- Give me that chair.

01:23:24.124 --> 01:23:26.210
You're tasting a little bland, lover.

01:23:26.418 --> 01:23:29.254
Are you getting enough
fatty acids in your diet?

01:23:29.463 --> 01:23:32.299
Have you tried lake trout?

01:23:32.508 --> 01:23:34.092
Mackerel?

01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:37.513
How about you take
a sugar-frosted fuck...

01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:39.681
...off the end of my dick?

01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:44.811
And how about everyone here
not saying the word "dick" anymore?

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.731
It provokes my envy.

01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:57.324
Tell us about Blade, King.

01:23:57.533 --> 01:24:00.077
What's this weapon he's been planning?

01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:02.788
I can tell you two things.

01:24:04.414 --> 01:24:06.083
One...

01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:10.420
...your hairdo is ridiculous.

01:24:11.463 --> 01:24:16.593
Two, I ate a lot of garlic,
and I just farted.

01:24:16.802 --> 01:24:18.262
Silent but deadly.

01:24:19.846 --> 01:24:22.099
Spit it out, you fucking fruitcake.

01:24:22.307 --> 01:24:25.102
All right! Fuck!
I'll tell you about the weapon.

01:24:33.402 --> 01:24:34.778
It's a new flavor-crystal formula.

01:24:34.987 --> 01:24:36.947
Twice the chocolatey goodness,
half the calories.

01:24:37.155 --> 01:24:39.575
Plus, it helps prevent tooth decay. There.

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:50.294
You're brave, King.

01:24:50.502 --> 01:24:51.837
I'll give you that.

01:24:52.963 --> 01:24:56.758
But underneath all that swagger...

01:24:56.967 --> 01:24:59.845
...I know what you really fear.

01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:03.765
What would hurt you more
than anything else.

01:25:17.195 --> 01:25:22.075
You don't wanna go back
to being one of us, do you?

01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:34.421
I'm gonna bite you again, King.

01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:39.217
And I'm gonna leave you
here while you turn.

01:25:39.426 --> 01:25:43.055
I'm going to watch you day after day...

01:25:43.263 --> 01:25:47.601
...as the thirst keeps building and building.

01:25:50.062 --> 01:25:51.563
And then...

01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:55.359
...when you can't stand it anymore...

01:26:00.947 --> 01:26:03.700
...I'm gonna bring the little girl in here...

01:26:05.369 --> 01:26:07.079
...for you to feed on.

01:26:09.039 --> 01:26:11.208
Would you like that, King?

01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:15.921
Would you enjoy taking her life?

01:26:32.062 --> 01:26:34.064
Now we're getting somewhere, my pet.

01:26:56.169 --> 01:26:57.462
Are you all right?

01:26:58.755 --> 01:27:00.716
Yeah. I'll be fine.

01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:05.429
Don't let it turn inward.

01:27:08.098 --> 01:27:10.726
Ever since I can remember,
I've had this...

01:27:12.018 --> 01:27:14.271
I've had this knife...

01:27:14.646 --> 01:27:16.940
...of sadness in my heart.

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:26.742
And as long as it's there,
I'm strong and I'm untouchable.

01:27:29.286 --> 01:27:32.164
But the moment that I take it out...

01:27:38.128 --> 01:27:40.172
...I'll just die.

01:28:38.855 --> 01:28:41.650
- He's one of ours.
- My name is Caulder.

01:28:41.858 --> 01:28:43.902
I'll be your driver this evening.

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:56.122
Sommerfield left you a video message.

01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:02.379
<i>If you're watching this,
I'm already dead.</i>

01:29:03.338 --> 01:29:07.884
<i>If Zoe's alive, I want you to promise me
that you'll take care of her, okay?</i>

01:29:08.093 --> 01:29:10.720
<i>I've been reading her
the Oz books every night.</i>

01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:14.349
<i>We just started reading</i>
The Emerald City of Oz.

01:29:14.558 --> 01:29:16.852
<i>You know, the one with the Nome King.</i>

01:29:19.646 --> 01:29:23.358
<i>I think I've managed to cultivate
a workable strain of the DayStar virus.</i>

01:29:23.567 --> 01:29:26.570
<i>As a precaution, I transmitted
the genetic sequence to Caulder...</i>

01:29:26.778 --> 01:29:28.864
<i>...in case our main stock was destroyed.</i>

01:29:29.739 --> 01:29:31.700
<i>In order for it to achieve
maximum lethality...</i>

01:29:31.908 --> 01:29:34.202
<i>...you're gonna need
to interfuse it with Drake's blood.</i>

01:29:35.078 --> 01:29:38.915
<i>Now, if it works, every vampire
in the immediate vicinity...</i>

01:29:39.124 --> 01:29:40.584
<i>...should die almost instantly.</i>

01:29:41.877 --> 01:29:43.420
<i>There's one other thing.</i>

01:29:44.004 --> 01:29:46.590
<i>Blade, you need to know...</i>

01:29:46.798 --> 01:29:49.342
<i>...there's a chance the virus
could destroy you too.</i>

01:29:49.551 --> 01:29:50.844
<i>Because you're a hybrid...</i>

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:54.097
<i>...I'm not sure if your immune
system will be able to tolerate it.</i>

01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:59.728
<i>I'm sorry. We just didn't have
enough time to properly test it.</i>

01:30:02.314 --> 01:30:05.859
So shall we take a look
at the plague arrow?

01:30:06.985 --> 01:30:10.530
I only had time to fabricate
a small amount of DayStar.

01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:16.411
However, I was able to outfit it...

01:30:17.662 --> 01:30:19.789
...in a compressed-gas projectile...

01:30:21.124 --> 01:30:27.047
...that can be shot from one
of the four-barrel rifles or a bow.

01:30:29.507 --> 01:30:33.094
Either way, you must be
sure that the shot counts.

01:30:34.054 --> 01:30:36.473
You will simply not have
enough for a second shot.

01:30:46.608 --> 01:30:48.109
Do you know who I am?

01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:51.112
You're the Nome King.

01:30:51.738 --> 01:30:52.781
Huh.

01:30:52.948 --> 01:30:54.783
The Nome King.

01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:56.826
How sweet.

01:30:57.035 --> 01:31:00.121
Tell me, child, do you want to die?

01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:01.623
I'm not afraid.

01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:03.375
I'll go to heaven.

01:31:04.209 --> 01:31:05.293
There is no heaven.

01:31:05.502 --> 01:31:08.797
No God, no angels.

01:31:09.005 --> 01:31:12.217
The only thing in your
future is nothingness.

01:31:12.425 --> 01:31:14.469
But what if you could change that?

01:31:14.678 --> 01:31:17.472
What if you could remain a child forever?

01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:19.933
Wouldn't you like that?

01:31:20.141 --> 01:31:21.977
Wouldn't you accept that gift?

01:31:23.645 --> 01:31:26.272
My friends are coming to kill you.

01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:42.075
Gonna be sorry you did that.

01:33:42.283 --> 01:33:43.868
Why?

01:33:45.703 --> 01:33:47.997
Nobody's coming for you, King Shit.

01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:51.209
Sure they are.

01:33:51.835 --> 01:33:52.961
God.

01:33:53.169 --> 01:33:58.550
See, one of the things you fuckheads
need to know about us Nightstalkers...

01:33:58.758 --> 01:34:03.972
...is that when you join our club,
you get all sorts of groovy little door prizes.

01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:08.810
And one of them is this nifty little tracking
node surgically implanted in your body.

01:34:10.937 --> 01:34:11.980
- Bullshit.
- Yeah.

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:17.485
See, when one of us goes missing...

01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:21.489
...the others, they just dial up the satellite...

01:34:21.698 --> 01:34:23.241
...which is in space.

01:34:23.449 --> 01:34:24.951
And then, presto...

01:34:25.827 --> 01:34:27.620
...instant cavalry.

01:34:28.705 --> 01:34:29.914
You like that, huh?

01:34:31.416 --> 01:34:32.667
Go fuck your sister.

01:34:32.876 --> 01:34:34.502
Okay, King.

01:34:36.004 --> 01:34:39.340
Where is this tracking node of yours?

01:34:40.383 --> 01:34:41.926
It's in my left ass cheek.

01:34:43.386 --> 01:34:44.596
Fine.

01:34:44.804 --> 01:34:46.514
It's in my right ass cheek.

01:34:48.266 --> 01:34:50.268
Okay, I'm... Okay, seriously, now.

01:34:51.519 --> 01:34:54.856
It's in the meat of my butt,
just below the Hello Kitty tattoo.

01:34:58.484 --> 01:35:01.279
Seriously, just pull down my
tighty-whities and see for yourself.

01:35:01.487 --> 01:35:04.157
Enough! It's not funny anymore!

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:06.784
No, it's not, you horse-humping bitch!

01:35:06.993 --> 01:35:09.287
But it will be a few seconds from now.

01:35:10.705 --> 01:35:13.541
That tickle that you're feeling
in the back of your throat right now...

01:35:15.126 --> 01:35:17.712
- Unh.
- ...that's atomized colloidal silver.

01:35:17.921 --> 01:35:20.381
It's being pumped through
the air-conditioning system...

01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:23.218
...you cock-juggling thundercunt!

01:35:32.268 --> 01:35:35.396
Which means the fat lady
should be singing...

01:35:35.605 --> 01:35:39.234
...right about now.

01:35:46.616 --> 01:35:48.910
Heh. This is awkward.

01:35:50.787 --> 01:35:52.413
Do you have a cell phone?

01:36:18.106 --> 01:36:19.482
Um...

01:36:19.649 --> 01:36:21.067
Little help here.

01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:05.486
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:37:05.695 --> 01:37:06.988
- Where's Zoe?
- Drake's got her.

01:37:07.196 --> 01:37:08.406
Okay.

01:37:12.368 --> 01:37:13.411
Thank you.

01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:16.247
Brought your toys.

01:37:17.248 --> 01:37:18.624
Try to keep up.

01:39:26.544 --> 01:39:29.172
- Abby!
- Hey.

01:39:30.548 --> 01:39:32.133
You okay?

01:39:32.341 --> 01:39:34.302
Okay. Let's get you out of here.

01:39:34.510 --> 01:39:35.553
Watch out!

01:39:56.574 --> 01:39:58.159
Fuck me.

01:40:01.329 --> 01:40:03.998
Fuck me sideways.

01:40:08.002 --> 01:40:09.045
Oh, yeah.

01:40:09.629 --> 01:40:11.881
He's a cute little guy, aren't you?

01:40:12.089 --> 01:40:13.174
Good little puppies.

01:40:13.382 --> 01:40:15.176
Yeah, you're gonna stay.

01:40:15.384 --> 01:40:16.719
You stay.

01:40:17.303 --> 01:40:20.640
Oh. There's a pretty smile. Yeah.

01:40:20.848 --> 01:40:22.517
I'm going to, uh...

01:41:03.057 --> 01:41:06.185
Hey, dickface, you seen my dog?

01:41:06.394 --> 01:41:08.312
Have you tried the lobby?

01:41:10.731 --> 01:41:11.857
Thank you.

01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:18.906
Fuck...

01:41:19.115 --> 01:41:21.659
- Come on, King.
- ...this.

01:41:39.218 --> 01:41:40.553
Blade.

01:41:41.721 --> 01:41:43.306
Ready to die?

01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:48.185
I was born ready, motherfucker.

01:41:51.022 --> 01:41:52.481
"Motherfucker."

01:41:52.690 --> 01:41:54.108
I like that.

01:43:38.713 --> 01:43:41.006
Broke my arm.

01:47:29.026 --> 01:47:31.362
Are you ready to die, motherfucker?

01:49:02.411 --> 01:49:03.662
Give it up.

01:49:03.871 --> 01:49:05.330
Come on. Give it up, King.

01:49:05.873 --> 01:49:08.042
Give it up. Give it up.

01:49:08.250 --> 01:49:09.376
Give it up.

01:49:36.487 --> 01:49:37.780
Hang in there, kitten.

01:49:37.988 --> 01:49:39.323
I'll get help.

01:49:49.792 --> 01:49:51.877
Funny, isn't it?

01:49:52.419 --> 01:49:57.007
All this time, my people were trying
to create a new kind of vampire...

01:49:57.216 --> 01:49:59.968
...when one already existed.

01:50:01.595 --> 01:50:03.222
I don't need to survive.

01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:06.558
The future of our race rests with you.

01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:09.812
You fought with honor.

01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:11.688
I respect that.

01:50:13.148 --> 01:50:15.109
Allow me a parting gift.

01:50:16.568 --> 01:50:18.070
But remember this:

01:50:18.946 --> 01:50:22.074
Sooner or later...

01:50:22.282 --> 01:50:25.661
...the thirst always wins.

01:53:25.215 --> 01:53:26.383
<i>And Blade?</i>

01:53:27.592 --> 01:53:29.428
<i>The virus didn't kill him.</i>

01:53:29.845 --> 01:53:32.514
<i>Because he was a hybrid,
his heart never stopped beating.</i>

01:53:32.681 --> 01:53:34.516
<i>It simply slowed down.</i>

01:53:34.683 --> 01:53:39.396
<i>And so he slept, waiting for the moment
he could walk the earth again.</i>
