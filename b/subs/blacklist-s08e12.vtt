00:10.802 --> 00:13.680
-Harold Cooper.
<i>-Harold. Russ Friedenberg.</i>

00:13.763 --> 00:16.391
<i>-We need to talk.</i>
-Congressman, has something happened?

00:16.474 --> 00:18.518
Things are much worse than we realized.

00:18.601 --> 00:21.229
-Is this about Rakitin?
<i>-No names. They could be listening.</i>

00:21.312 --> 00:23.982
-Who could be listening?
<i>-He's not real. We're being played.</i>

00:24.065 --> 00:27.485
They've got us chasing our tails,
trying to find some hacker, it's a ruse--

00:27.569 --> 00:30.947
-Slow down.
-The phone isn't safe. We need to meet.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.242
-I'll come to your office.
-No. No. Two hours.

00:34.325 --> 00:36.077
<i>I'll text you an address.</i>

00:40.665 --> 00:41.666
[keypad beeps]

00:44.377 --> 00:46.296
My daughter will be home within the hour.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.548
As we agreed, she won't be harmed.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.510
You won't get away with this.

00:53.887 --> 00:57.265
Perhaps not. The outcome is uncertain.

00:57.348 --> 01:00.518
Sadly, you won't get to see how it ends.

01:09.486 --> 01:13.740
Be thankful that you died
of natural causes.

01:15.784 --> 01:19.454
Things can get messy
when we need to send a message.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.122
[groans]

01:35.011 --> 01:37.722
We should be on the ground
in a few minutes.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.975
Good. I just heard from our friend.

01:41.059 --> 01:44.229
We won't need the car,
he'll meet us at the hangar.

01:44.312 --> 01:47.649
Quick pep talk and we'll be heading home.

01:47.732 --> 01:51.694
We flew 5000 miles for a conversation
you could've had on the phone.

01:51.778 --> 01:56.825
He's nervous. You know how he thinks.
Harold's getting closer to Rakitin.

01:56.908 --> 02:00.995
He wants me to look him in the eye
and tell him I have a plan.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.080
Do you?

02:02.163 --> 02:04.874
[Raymond] <i>To make Harold back off?</i>
<i>No, not really.</i>

02:04.958 --> 02:06.501
[Dembe] <i>We have to do something.</i>

02:06.584 --> 02:09.671
If Cooper won't stop, the only move
is to take Rakitin out of play.

02:09.754 --> 02:12.006
Harold has him under surveillance.

02:12.090 --> 02:16.469
It's guesswork at this point,
a hunch the man he's following is Rakitin.

02:16.553 --> 02:20.682
If Rakitin disappeared,
Harold's suspicions would be confirmed.

02:20.765 --> 02:24.310
Besides, Rakitin is one
of our most productive assets.

02:24.394 --> 02:25.687
We need to keep him working.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.772
Even if it puts Cooper in jeopardy?

02:28.356 --> 02:31.401
-[Raymond] <i>Our friend is a reasonable man.</i>
-[Dembe] <i>He's careful.</i>

02:31.985 --> 02:33.778
<i>He's already threatened Cooper's life.</i>

02:33.862 --> 02:35.905
<i>It's only a matter of time.</i>

02:35.989 --> 02:38.825
[Raymond] <i>He won't kill him.</i>
<i>Not without my consent.</i>

02:38.908 --> 02:42.036
-You're spinning too many plates.
-Yes.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.039
If we're lucky, the curtain will close

02:45.123 --> 02:47.625
<i>before anyone sees them</i>
<i>come crashing down.</i>

02:49.377 --> 02:50.295
Dad?

02:51.170 --> 02:52.297
[Rakitin] <i>I'm on schedule.</i>

02:52.380 --> 02:54.382
[Eastern friend] <i>Good. So am I.</i>

02:54.924 --> 02:56.759
I'm going to see Reddington.

02:58.344 --> 02:59.345
[keypad beeps]

03:09.439 --> 03:10.899
Ah. There you are.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.068
Would you care for a coffee or a Scotch?

03:14.152 --> 03:16.487
-We need to talk.
-Please.

03:17.655 --> 03:19.657
[tense music playing]

03:22.911 --> 03:24.746
You're concerned about Harold Cooper.

03:25.496 --> 03:26.873
That's why you called me here,

03:26.956 --> 03:31.085
so I can look you in the eye
and assure you things are under control.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.004
I don't need your assurance.

03:33.671 --> 03:36.591
Things are under control
because I control them.

03:37.592 --> 03:38.718
What are you getting at?

03:38.801 --> 03:40.845
I never liked you working with the FBI,

03:40.929 --> 03:43.973
<i>but at least when we started</i>
<i>you knew what they were,</i>

03:44.057 --> 03:46.226
<i>means to our mutual end.</i>

03:46.309 --> 03:50.563
You've come to care about them in a way
that is detrimental to our objective.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.523
I told you I would handle it.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.025
But you didn't.

03:54.108 --> 03:57.946
Rakitin cannot be arrested.
He must not be interrogated.

03:58.029 --> 04:02.575
<i>You have a deal with the FBI.</i>
<i>Rakitin does not.</i>

04:02.659 --> 04:05.286
<i>-He's exposed.</i>
-[Raymond] <i>You think he'll talk.</i>

04:05.370 --> 04:06.287
[Eastern friend] <i>Don't you?</i>

04:06.371 --> 04:08.748
He doesn't know you work with them.

04:08.831 --> 04:13.920
All he sees is the FBI getting closer
and you refusing to act.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.464
That's why you insisted I come to Moscow.

04:17.507 --> 04:20.218
You wanted me out of the way.
Out of position.

04:21.761 --> 04:25.765
[Eastern friend] <i>Rakitin doesn't just work</i>
<i>for us. He does projects.</i>

04:25.848 --> 04:30.645
<i>Dozens of highly sensitive projects</i>
<i>for the SVR.</i>

04:30.728 --> 04:33.648
If he talks, they're all blown.

04:38.736 --> 04:39.570
Hello?

04:39.654 --> 04:40.989
[horn honks]

04:41.072 --> 04:42.073
[Raymond] <i>Call it off.</i>

04:43.658 --> 04:44.617
Call it off.

04:44.701 --> 04:45.743
It's too late.

04:45.827 --> 04:48.329
<i>There's nothing anyone can do for him now.</i>

05:07.807 --> 05:08.975
Director Cooper?

05:12.020 --> 05:12.895
Who are you?

05:12.979 --> 05:15.315
-Where's the congressman?
-Close.

05:15.398 --> 05:19.235
-Leave the car, I'll take you to him.
-Tell me what is going on.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.612
Leave the car. He sent me to meet you.

05:25.158 --> 05:25.992
Move it.

05:38.087 --> 05:40.089
[suspenseful music playing]

05:48.222 --> 05:51.142
Put him down. I wanna talk to him first.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.191
[Rakitin chuckles]

06:00.902 --> 06:02.737
You wanna know how I found you?

06:03.404 --> 06:07.533
-Uh... I found you.
-I'm an assistant director of the FBI.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.994
The bureau's been looking for Rakitin
for some time.

06:10.078 --> 06:13.539
Looking, with nothing to show for it.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.834
And then, suddenly,
you appear out of nowhere.

06:17.710 --> 06:20.630
[Dembe] They have orders to kill him.
He may already be dead.

06:21.839 --> 06:23.841
We have to call Ressler,
warn the task force.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.927
I told Harold he was in danger.

06:26.010 --> 06:28.846
Stubborn son of a bitch couldn't let go.
Call Rakitin.

06:32.016 --> 06:33.017
[line rings]

06:33.893 --> 06:35.144
[cell phone buzzing]

06:39.857 --> 06:40.983
Not a good time.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.819
You do not have my authorization,

06:42.902 --> 06:45.988
which means whatever pain
you inflict on Cooper

06:46.072 --> 06:48.241
will be revisited upon you tenfold.

06:48.324 --> 06:51.661
<i>-Are we clear?</i>
-I don't need your authorization.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.288
Our Eastern friend gave me
the green light.

06:54.372 --> 06:57.333
I just left our friend.
I told him Cooper was under control.

06:57.416 --> 07:00.920
<i>-Now, you listen to me--</i>
-[Cooper] Why should I tell you anything?

07:01.003 --> 07:04.590
-You'll kill me anyway.
-Ha! Second time I've heard that today.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.801
The congressman asked me
the same question.

07:07.593 --> 07:08.803
-Friedenberg?
-Mm.

07:08.886 --> 07:11.639
You used him to lure me out.
Did you hurt him?

07:12.306 --> 07:15.560
Please. He hardly felt a thing.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.605
And by helping set a trap for you,

07:19.689 --> 07:23.609
he bought himself
a long life for his daughter.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.320
I'll make you the same offer.

07:26.404 --> 07:31.367
If you talk, when we're done here,
I won't go and visit Charlene.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.035
Or your son.

07:34.036 --> 07:36.164
Rakitin can't get arrested.
He knows too much.

07:36.247 --> 07:39.000
We can take care of it
after Cooper is safe.

07:39.709 --> 07:43.129
If you kill me,
the task force I lead will investigate.

07:43.212 --> 07:45.256
-They'll know it was you.
-Mmm.

07:45.339 --> 07:48.718
No. No. They may suspect,
but they won't have proof.

07:49.343 --> 07:50.970
That's why we're here.

07:51.053 --> 07:53.598
To stop you before you can make your case.

07:53.681 --> 07:56.684
And your death won't look like a murder.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.481
You've been depressed, haven't you?

08:01.564 --> 08:03.024
[Rakitin sighs]

08:03.107 --> 08:07.069
Sadly, it's all too common among men
who work in law enforcement.

08:07.153 --> 08:11.699
You wrote a note
before taking your own life.

08:11.782 --> 08:15.203
See, that's where the carbon monoxide
comes into the scene.

08:15.286 --> 08:19.248
You left your car running
in a closed garage.

08:20.708 --> 08:24.420
About an hour from now,
you will be found dead,

08:24.504 --> 08:26.923
your lungs filled with fumes.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.299
[cell phone buzzing]

08:35.348 --> 08:36.182
Yes?

08:36.265 --> 08:39.060
If you're gonna kill him,
at least squeeze him first.

08:39.143 --> 08:41.312
Ah, I knew you'd come around.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.147
<i>He runs a secret task force.</i>

08:43.231 --> 08:45.900
The bureau doesn't even
acknowledge it exists.

08:45.983 --> 08:48.236
I wanna know everything
they're working on.

08:48.319 --> 08:51.030
<i>-Be sure you get details.</i>
-Consider it done.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.370
Did you get that?

08:57.453 --> 08:59.080
[computer beeps]

08:59.163 --> 09:01.040
We got it. A warehouse on Fullerton.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.208
<i>Go now.</i>

09:02.291 --> 09:04.126
Or he won't be alive when you get there.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.212
[suspenseful music playing]

09:07.797 --> 09:09.257
[coughing and wheezing]

09:10.091 --> 09:14.053
Okay, now let's try this one more time.

09:14.136 --> 09:17.557
Who told you about the stolen files?

09:17.640 --> 09:20.142
The ones I placed
on the Volgograd servers.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.143
Nobody.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.815
[coughing]

09:28.568 --> 09:30.403
I want a name!

09:33.698 --> 09:35.074
I fed you a suspect,

09:35.157 --> 09:38.619
I gave you every reason
to believe Rakitin was dead,

09:38.703 --> 09:40.997
and yet you persisted.

09:41.664 --> 09:42.498
Why?

09:44.792 --> 09:46.294
Because we're the FBI.

09:49.839 --> 09:50.715
[groans]

09:53.134 --> 09:53.968
Finish him.

09:55.303 --> 09:59.223
You know where to take him.
Make sure the police find the note.

10:08.649 --> 10:10.568
-Cooper!
-[man] We're clear!

10:12.194 --> 10:13.529
Hey, Cooper!

10:13.904 --> 10:15.197
[gasping]

10:22.288 --> 10:23.331
[Aram] Mr. Cooper.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.709
Thank God you're all right.
I heard what happened.

10:26.792 --> 10:27.960
Put him in Box 1.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.922
Call Panabaker.
Tell her I need her here right away.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.258
You should let us get you a medic.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.554
-Sir.
-[cell phone ringing]

10:39.722 --> 10:41.432
Harold. Thank goodness.

10:41.515 --> 10:43.934
-You knew nothing about this?
<i>-Of course not.</i>

10:44.018 --> 10:46.103
I helped the task force find you.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.064
<i>If you think that changes things,</i>
<i>you're wrong.</i>

10:48.147 --> 10:50.650
We have Rakitin. I'm not standing down.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.944
<i>-If he implicates you--</i>
-You'll follow the evidence.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.864
<i>I have no doubt you will.</i>
<i>We can worry about that another time.</i>

10:56.947 --> 10:58.574
-[call waiting beeps]
-Ah.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.827
That's me. I need to take this.
Deep breaths, Harold.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.245
I'm glad you're alive.

11:05.998 --> 11:09.835
-They have Rakitin in custody!
-Couldn't be avoided.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.505
It could've been if you'd listened to me.

11:12.588 --> 11:14.548
He's one of our top operatives

11:14.632 --> 11:17.718
and you hand-delivered him
to the American government.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.805
I can see I've made
a mistake with you, old friend.

11:21.639 --> 11:26.477
We've been on the same side so long,
you've forgotten who you're talking to.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.979
[Eastern friend]
<i>You're the one forgetting.</i>

11:29.063 --> 11:31.190
<i>If he talks, if he exposes me,</i>

11:31.941 --> 11:34.777
<i>exposes what he's done for the SVR,</i>

11:34.860 --> 11:41.242
the full weight of this agency
will come down on you like a thunderbolt.

11:41.325 --> 11:45.079
That won't happen.
Because here's what I'm going to do.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.081
I'm going to fix it.

11:47.164 --> 11:50.543
And then, when it's done,
you and I are gonna have a chat.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.259
We can't break him out.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.928
He's under guard at the Post Office.

12:01.011 --> 12:03.764
Raymond, it's impossible.

12:22.116 --> 12:24.201
-Just listen.
<i>-Elizabeth was clear.</i>

12:24.285 --> 12:26.787
You were only to reach out
in an emergency.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.122
Don't trace this.

Signal's untraceable,
I'm losing this phone in 30 seconds.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.960
Skip, stop talking.
I need to speak with Keen.

12:33.043 --> 12:36.464
<i>Tell her to call me.</i>
<i>Or get me a number where I can call her.</i>

12:36.547 --> 12:37.798
What's happened?

12:37.882 --> 12:39.675
The situation here changed.

12:39.758 --> 12:42.720
If things go well,
we may be getting close to the end.

12:43.846 --> 12:44.889
The end of what?

12:45.639 --> 12:46.515
Reddington.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.560
We may be able to prove
she was right all along.

12:49.643 --> 12:52.438
I'm talking about bringing her in,
on her own terms.

13:01.864 --> 13:05.534
[Panabaker] My God, Harold.
I can't imagine.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.787
If you need time,
whatever I can do to make things easier--

13:08.871 --> 13:10.414
I appreciate your concern.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.417
But I have a feeling
when you hear why it happened,

13:13.501 --> 13:15.961
sympathy may not be
the first emotion that comes to mind.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.964
Oh... It's not my first rodeo, partner.

13:19.673 --> 13:22.843
You've been hiding something,
I've known for a while.

13:22.927 --> 13:26.305
Something big.
The real reason Keen went out on her own.

13:26.388 --> 13:29.308
She saw Reddington kill her mother,
that's enough.

13:29.391 --> 13:30.518
That's half the story.

13:30.601 --> 13:33.395
And to tell it,
we have to go back over 30 years

13:33.479 --> 13:35.773
to the fall of the Soviet Union.

13:35.856 --> 13:39.360
Around that time a file was stolen
from Soviet intelligence.

13:39.443 --> 13:42.905
A blackmail file
consisting of 13 packets of data.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.115
Damaging intel on rival governments,

13:45.199 --> 13:48.202
secrets held by some of the most powerful
people and corporations.

13:48.285 --> 13:51.747
-Who stole it?
-An unidentified Russian operative.

13:52.581 --> 13:58.462
Thirteen packets so, after the theft,
the Russians began calling him N-13.

13:58.546 --> 14:02.424
The stolen file is the Sikorsky Archive.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.469
I'm gonna need a scratch pad.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.930
That's where Neville Townsend comes in.

14:08.013 --> 14:11.225
He was one of the powerful people
named in the Archive.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.270
As a result, his family was killed.

14:14.353 --> 14:18.399
He put a bounty on the head
of the woman he thought was responsible.

14:18.482 --> 14:19.900
Katerina Rostova.

14:19.984 --> 14:20.860
Exactly.

14:21.735 --> 14:24.446
Agent Keen's mother ran for 30 years.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.491
All the while, insisting she was framed,

14:27.575 --> 14:30.035
set up by the real N-13.

14:31.620 --> 14:35.249
Not Reddington.
Please don't say Reddington.

14:35.332 --> 14:36.834
That's what Agent Keen believes.

14:37.793 --> 14:40.629
Her mother found proof,
but Reddington killed her

14:40.713 --> 14:42.006
before she could release it.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.757
Keen believes he's a Russian spy.

14:43.841 --> 14:47.386
A plant sent to infiltrate
our intelligence agencies

14:47.469 --> 14:49.054
and execute some endgame.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.599
-You believe her?
-I didn't at first, but...

14:52.892 --> 14:54.226
now I think she may be right.

14:55.394 --> 14:58.522
The man we arrested today
is Andrew Patterson,

14:58.606 --> 15:00.608
but the Russians call him Rakitin.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.403
He's feeding intel to N-13.

15:04.486 --> 15:07.531
Clearly, he works with or for Reddington.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.408
Let me get this straight.

15:10.451 --> 15:13.078
You're saying our confidential informant,

15:13.162 --> 15:15.873
the man we officially gave
blanket immunity,

15:16.540 --> 15:19.043
is actually a Russian sleeper agent?

15:20.544 --> 15:21.754
Quite possibly.

15:21.837 --> 15:23.172
[cell phone buzzes]

15:25.090 --> 15:26.926
-Keen?
-I can give you a number.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.053
Leave a message
and Elizabeth will hear it.

15:29.136 --> 15:31.597
-I need to talk to her.
<i>-That was conveyed.</i>

15:31.680 --> 15:33.390
She gave clear instructions.

15:33.474 --> 15:36.310
-She didn't trust me?
<i>-She does, I don't.</i>

15:36.393 --> 15:39.355
I told her to ignore you.
Now, do you want the number or not?

15:40.814 --> 15:41.649
Shoot.

15:42.566 --> 15:45.152
In a way,
you were right to try to kill me.

15:45.819 --> 15:46.946
I wouldn't have stopped.

15:47.029 --> 15:50.199
Not until I knew the truth
and you were in that chair.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.117
But Friedenberg...

15:53.410 --> 15:55.746
he was a politician, not an agent.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.375
Killing him was unnecessary.

15:59.458 --> 16:02.419
-[Rakitin] How did your people find us?
-[Cooper] That's two murders.

16:02.503 --> 16:05.589
The congressman and the suspect...
How did you put it?

16:05.673 --> 16:07.633
...you "fed" to us as a misdirect.

16:07.716 --> 16:11.679
I'm sitting here, doing the math.
I just can't make sense of it.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.098
Add to that the attempted murder
of a federal agent,

16:14.181 --> 16:16.684
at least a dozen intrusions
into government servers,

16:16.767 --> 16:20.020
the theft of confidential intelligence,
and the treason.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.814
It wasn't one of my people.

16:21.897 --> 16:25.901
Only two of them knew of our location,
and your agents killed them.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.612
How long have you been spying
for the Russians?

16:31.782 --> 16:34.243
It doesn't matter. We'll find out.

16:34.326 --> 16:37.705
As we speak, agents are taking apart
your home and office,

16:37.788 --> 16:39.748
scrubbing every device,
document and drive.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.334
-I should've just shot you.
-And you know the best part?

16:42.418 --> 16:45.212
You were right, our case wasn't there yet.

16:45.295 --> 16:49.758
By coming after me,
you made it so much easier, Mr. Patterson.

16:54.972 --> 16:57.224
[Raymond on recording]
<i>He runs a secret task force.</i>

16:57.307 --> 16:59.977
<i>The bureau doesn't even</i>
<i>acknowledge it exists.</i>

17:00.060 --> 17:02.563
<i>I wanna know everything</i>
<i>they're working on.</i>

17:02.646 --> 17:05.232
<i>-Be sure you get details.</i>
-[Park] So it's true.

17:05.315 --> 17:07.609
Keen was right. Reddington is N-13.

17:07.693 --> 17:11.572
How is this possible? Mr. Reddington
knew how to contact Rakitin.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.700
He has been playing us this whole time...

17:14.783 --> 17:16.577
for the Russians? I just--

17:18.245 --> 17:19.371
I don't understand it.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.832
You think this means
Keen can come in from the cold?

17:21.915 --> 17:24.418
I don't know.
She tried to kill Reddington.

17:24.501 --> 17:27.796
She got the Freelancer out to target
a plane full of innocent passengers.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.090
Yeah, but she warned us
in time to save them.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.216
But what if we didn't?

17:32.551 --> 17:33.719
I don't know.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.638
Maybe there's a way. I just--

17:36.722 --> 17:38.557
One thing is for sure, if Rakitin talks

17:38.640 --> 17:41.852
and confirms Mr. Reddington is
on some Russian mission,

17:42.686 --> 17:43.979
say goodbye to his immunity deal.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.355
You think that could happen?

17:45.439 --> 17:48.525
I don't think anyone could stop it
from happening.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.444
[cell phone ringing]

17:54.698 --> 17:56.658
-You're calling me?
-[Raymond] <i>Agent Park.</i>

17:56.742 --> 17:59.578
You seem surprised.
I thought we were colleagues.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.789
-What do you want?
<i>-Payback.</i>

18:01.872 --> 18:04.291
That favor you owe me,
it's time to collect.

18:04.374 --> 18:06.919
-I can't help you.
<i>-Oh, yes, you can.</i>

18:07.002 --> 18:07.961
And you will.

18:08.670 --> 18:11.465
We need to meet.
Dembe will send you an address.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.634
<i>Leave now, we don't have much time.</i>

18:21.391 --> 18:23.435
-[electronic voice] <i>Record at the tone.</i>
-[voicemail beeps]

18:23.519 --> 18:27.481
Hey, Keen, it's me.
I know you don't wanna talk in person,

18:27.564 --> 18:29.566
maybe 'cause you think I'm angry,
but I'm not.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.861
I don't understand
all the choices you've made.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.655
Townsend's a killer.

18:34.738 --> 18:38.450
He put a bounty on your mother's head,
now he's your partner. Where does it stop?

18:40.410 --> 18:41.703
It has to stop.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.832
We have Rakitin, thanks to you,
and that flash drive you sent Cooper.

18:44.915 --> 18:48.627
If Reddington's really N-13,
we have a good chance of proving it.

18:48.710 --> 18:54.258
And if we can, maybe you can come home.
It's all I care about, Liz.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.469
Maybe you can't be an agent again,

18:57.553 --> 19:01.431
but at least you can get your life back,
you and Agnes can be together.

19:02.558 --> 19:06.603
The point is, I'm here,
and I'm still on your side.

19:07.896 --> 19:10.023
We gotta talk, figure out how to end this.

19:10.107 --> 19:12.818
I'm gonna be at Bentham Park
at midnight. Meet me there.

19:12.901 --> 19:15.612
And, Keen, you can trust me.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.871
[Raymond] <i>Ah. So you're outside Coatti's?</i>

19:23.954 --> 19:25.956
[Park] Yeah. After a 40-minute drive.

19:26.039 --> 19:27.583
Are you inside? What are we doing?

19:27.666 --> 19:29.084
Oh, dear, I'm sorry.

19:29.168 --> 19:34.298
I'm afraid I gave you the false impression
we were going on this field trip together.

19:34.381 --> 19:35.507
We're not.

19:35.591 --> 19:38.135
<i>I'll be guiding you through this remotely.</i>

19:38.218 --> 19:41.847
I'm sure I don't need to remind you
of our little arrangement.

19:41.930 --> 19:45.601
<i>-You asked me to make a man disappear.</i>
-I know what happened.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.769
That's no small thing, am I right?

19:47.853 --> 19:50.856
<i>Erasing a human being from existence.</i>

19:50.939 --> 19:56.153
In your case, someone capable of ending
your career and sending you to prison.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.405
<i>At the time, if you remember,</i>

19:58.488 --> 20:02.034
I warned you
that repayment might be unpleasant.

20:02.117 --> 20:03.202
Yeah, fine.

20:03.744 --> 20:06.788
What does that have to do with you
sending me here to this garage?

20:06.872 --> 20:10.667
Agent Park,
please, just watch and wait for it.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.502
Wait for what? What's wrong with you?

20:12.586 --> 20:15.047
-What are you talking about?
<i>-Wait for it.</i>

20:15.672 --> 20:16.506
<i>Wait.</i>

20:21.511 --> 20:23.180
[Park] <i>You sent men to Jenna's apartment?</i>

20:23.263 --> 20:24.681
[dramatic music playing]

20:30.270 --> 20:32.773
-Dieterle.
<i>-Yahtzee! Yes!</i>

20:32.856 --> 20:35.776
Mr. Mason Dieterle in the flesh.

20:35.859 --> 20:39.446
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a winner. Agent Alina Park.

20:39.529 --> 20:42.407
-I thought you took care of him.
<i>-And that's exactly what I did.</i>

20:42.491 --> 20:45.202
You didn't ask me to kill him,
you asked me to make him go away.

20:45.285 --> 20:48.830
We gave him a new identity,
relocated him outside the city.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.875
He resisted at first,
but we can be very persuasive.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.835
-How does he look?
-Why would you do this?

20:53.919 --> 20:55.003
<i>For this very moment.</i>

20:55.087 --> 20:59.132
It occurred to me that you might need
some additional motivation.

20:59.216 --> 21:02.886
<i>So do as you're told</i>
<i>and Mr. Dieterle remains a ghost.</i>

21:02.970 --> 21:06.765
Refuse, and hallelujah, he's born again.

21:06.848 --> 21:08.058
Are you surprised?

21:08.141 --> 21:11.728
What if I take my chances?
It's my word against his.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.272
<i>That occurred to me as well.</i>

21:13.355 --> 21:17.317
<i>If you'd be so kind</i>
<i>as to check the video in your inbox.</i>

21:20.487 --> 21:21.530
<i>Screw that.</i>

21:23.991 --> 21:25.534
Oh, my gosh, this is fun.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.954
What the hell do you want me to do?
Rakitin's being guarded.

21:29.037 --> 21:31.581
I can't get you in,
and there's no way to break him out.

21:31.665 --> 21:33.583
Right? It's a puzzle.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.168
Go back to the office.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.713
<i>When my plan's in place, we'll reconvene.</i>

21:37.796 --> 21:41.383
<i>And I promise you,</i>
<i>it'll be even more exciting.</i>

I'm sorry.
The front office is down the hall.

22:09.786 --> 22:14.708
Cvetko said you were teaching.
High school biology and chemistry?

22:14.791 --> 22:17.336
That's admirable
for a man of your talents.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.505
Cvetko? I'm not sure
who you've mistaken me for.

22:20.589 --> 22:23.842
My name is Geoffrey Hill. Have we met?

22:23.925 --> 22:27.054
Just once.
Don't feel badly, it was years ago.

22:27.137 --> 22:29.765
But it's why I know
your name is Felix Klopp.

22:30.724 --> 22:33.226
Ah! Hold on, this might help.

at that military prison in Ankara? Felix.

22:45.697 --> 22:46.823
[Dembe] Ah, yes.

22:46.907 --> 22:50.243
You built the device
that sucked all the oxygen

22:50.327 --> 22:52.621
out of the dining car
on the Kowloon Express.

-Yes.
-[Dembe laughs]

22:54.122 --> 22:55.624
[Dembe] Who was that for?

22:55.707 --> 22:57.250
No, no, no, don't tell us.

22:57.334 --> 22:58.376
It had to be MI6.

22:58.460 --> 23:01.588
All the gadgets you've built for them
over the years...

23:01.671 --> 23:04.299
That was a long time ago. I'm retired.

23:04.382 --> 23:06.426
Well, not entirely.

23:06.510 --> 23:11.306
Cvetko mentioned you still occasionally
do side jobs when the money's right.

23:12.390 --> 23:13.683
I see.

23:13.767 --> 23:16.561
What exactly is it
that you think I could do?

23:16.645 --> 23:19.147
What you always do. The impossible.

23:19.231 --> 23:23.527
There's a man being interrogated
in a highly secure room,

23:23.610 --> 23:25.946
heavily guarded, no way in or out.

23:26.029 --> 23:27.906
I want to remove him.

23:29.157 --> 23:30.158
A breakout?

23:30.242 --> 23:33.703
Well, if that's what you think is best.
I'm open to ideas.

23:33.787 --> 23:39.543
But the important thing is that the man
cannot be given any chance to cooperate.

23:40.710 --> 23:44.631
I may have an idea.
But it's dangerous. Risky.

23:44.714 --> 23:46.424
It would take time to create,

23:46.508 --> 23:49.636
and I'm giving a quiz
on covalent bonds in ten minutes.

23:49.719 --> 23:53.056
No, Felix, you're not.
School's out for today.

23:53.140 --> 23:56.560
Now, tell me about your idea.

23:57.144 --> 23:59.020
[Cooper] Amazing how life goes.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.439
A few hours ago, you almost killed me,

24:01.523 --> 24:03.692
now you're the one in mortal danger.

24:04.693 --> 24:05.694
Am I?

24:06.486 --> 24:09.489
I wouldn't wanna be you.
With the work you've done?

24:09.573 --> 24:12.951
How do you think Russian intelligence
feels about you being in FBI custody?

24:13.034 --> 24:15.829
Even if you don't talk,
you know they won't risk it.

24:15.912 --> 24:18.415
Their best choice is to eliminate you
as a variable.

24:18.498 --> 24:22.878
Ah, I see. This is the part
where you claim you can protect me.

24:22.961 --> 24:23.962
And let me guess,

24:24.045 --> 24:27.674
all I need to do to earn your mercy
is tell you everything I know.

24:27.757 --> 24:30.343
No. I don't care
about everything you know.

24:31.052 --> 24:33.305
Right now all I care about is N-13.

24:33.388 --> 24:36.516
I wanna know the endgame.
What was N-13 sent to do?

24:40.896 --> 24:45.442
You asked me how my people found us.
The answer is, they didn't.

24:45.525 --> 24:47.027
Reddington gave you up.

24:48.069 --> 24:49.154
Harold.

24:50.780 --> 24:51.948
That's a lie.

24:52.032 --> 24:54.784
You don't know anything
about the man you're protecting.

24:54.868 --> 24:56.536
[Raymond on recording]
<i>He runs a secret task force.</i>

24:56.620 --> 24:59.289
<i>The bureau doesn't even</i>
<i>acknowledge it exists.</i>

24:59.372 --> 25:01.666
<i>-I wanna know everything.</i>
-Don't do it.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.001
<i>Be sure you get details.</i>

25:03.084 --> 25:04.377
[Rakitin] <i>Consider it done.</i>

25:04.878 --> 25:06.254
[Raymond] <i>Did you get that?</i>

25:06.338 --> 25:08.423
[Aram] <i>We got it.</i>
<i>They're at a warehouse on Fullerton.</i>

25:08.506 --> 25:11.301
[Raymond] <i>Go now. Or he won't be alive</i>
<i>when you get there.</i>

25:11.384 --> 25:13.345
-Why would he do that?
-We need to talk.

25:13.428 --> 25:15.513
Stop protecting him.
He doesn't care about you.

25:15.597 --> 25:18.099
-You're a pawn. He sacrificed--
-We need to talk now.

25:22.646 --> 25:25.774
-You wanna tell me what you were doing?
-I had to do something.

25:25.857 --> 25:29.236
You came close
to exposing Reddington as our informant.

25:29.319 --> 25:32.864
-I don't care. He has answers we need.
-You don't care?

25:32.948 --> 25:36.451
Who am I talking to now,
Harold Cooper or Elizabeth Keen?

25:36.534 --> 25:39.871
[Cooper] Did you see the look
on his face? It worked, Cynthia.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.373
He's thrown, he wants to talk.

25:41.456 --> 25:44.334
There is a difference
between talking and telling the truth.

25:44.417 --> 25:46.044
The Cooper I know understands that.

25:46.127 --> 25:48.463
Meaning what?
You think Reddington's innocent?

25:48.546 --> 25:50.507
-He's not N-13?
-I don't know.

25:50.590 --> 25:53.969
But now, whatever Rakitin tells us,
we're gonna have to wonder if it's true

25:54.052 --> 25:56.263
or just a way to get revenge
on Reddington.

25:56.346 --> 25:58.306
We are missing something.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.643
If Reddington really is N-13,
why did he save you?

26:01.726 --> 26:04.020
Why hand us
one of his chief collaborators?

26:04.104 --> 26:05.855
You do. You think I'm wrong.

26:06.481 --> 26:09.818
Maybe. And you know my best argument?

26:09.901 --> 26:12.112
Rakitin's still sitting in that room.

26:12.737 --> 26:15.657
You think if he knew the truth,
Reddington would ever allow that?

26:15.740 --> 26:18.493
Don't you think he'd be trying to stop it?

26:32.173 --> 26:33.300
Has he said anything?

26:33.383 --> 26:34.884
Not yet. If he doesn't talk soon,

26:34.968 --> 26:37.304
the plan is to transport him
to a black site by morning.

26:37.387 --> 26:40.265
-Then we need to act quickly.
-How? I can't break him out.

26:40.348 --> 26:42.726
-I'm not asking you to.
-Then what?

26:42.809 --> 26:45.312
I can't hurt him. I won't.

26:45.395 --> 26:47.522
Tell Cooper about Dieterle, I don't care.

26:47.605 --> 26:50.358
Really. What do you imagine
I'd have you do?

26:50.442 --> 26:52.319
Shoot the man in cold blood?

26:52.402 --> 26:55.655
All you have to do
is pass along these instructions.

26:55.739 --> 26:58.616
Instructions to do what?
You can't break him out.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.243
The less you know, the better.

27:00.910 --> 27:05.749
Do not read it. Don't even open it.
I'm very serious.

27:05.832 --> 27:09.794
The instructions it contains
are for Rakitin's eyes only.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.630
He's locked down. How do I get it to him?

27:12.714 --> 27:15.633
-That part's up to you.
-After? What happens then?

27:15.717 --> 27:16.843
Burn the evidence.

27:16.926 --> 27:19.429
As I said, the less you know, the better.

27:19.512 --> 27:23.516
Whatever happens,
it's my doing, not yours.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.393
Now, wish us luck.

27:26.061 --> 27:27.854
We're all going to need it.

27:36.279 --> 27:38.031
[dramatic music playing]

27:42.285 --> 27:43.495
You asked to see me?

27:44.704 --> 27:47.749
-I've decided to make a statement.
-Is that so?

27:48.375 --> 27:50.418
What, may I ask, changed your mind?

27:51.336 --> 27:53.546
I know why Reddington gave me up.

27:55.173 --> 27:59.511
To punish me for my disobedience.

27:59.594 --> 28:04.140
You see,
I asked for his permission to kill you.

28:05.016 --> 28:07.727
But he refused,
he said he'd handle it himself.

28:07.811 --> 28:12.190
And when he didn't,
I took matters into my own hands.

28:12.816 --> 28:16.611
To him, that deserves a death sentence.

28:16.694 --> 28:22.075
It doesn't matter what our history is,
I defied him, so I am expendable.

28:22.784 --> 28:23.827
I see.

28:23.910 --> 28:27.497
And now he expects me to stay quiet.

28:27.580 --> 28:32.877
To take my punishment like a man,
to go to prison for my sins.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.587
If that's what he expects,

28:34.671 --> 28:38.967
then he's about to find out
just how wrong he is.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.343
We can try to protect you.

28:40.427 --> 28:42.470
No, we're well past that.

28:43.263 --> 28:48.768
He destroyed my life
when he made that phone call.

28:49.477 --> 28:52.897
And now it's my turn
to inflict a little damage,

28:52.981 --> 28:58.778
which includes my very educated guess
that he is your informant.

29:02.323 --> 29:04.075
That's how they found us.

29:04.159 --> 29:08.955
That little recording you played,
the one your boss didn't want me to hear,

29:10.290 --> 29:12.751
you got that from Reddington, didn't you?

29:15.128 --> 29:17.589
Because he works for you.

29:19.048 --> 29:20.675
I'll make the arrangements.

29:22.969 --> 29:25.597
[door opens, then closes]

29:27.724 --> 29:29.726
[suspenseful music playing]

29:30.435 --> 29:33.688
This should work.
Make sure he signs it before we start.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.273
-What is it?
-Insurance.

29:35.356 --> 29:38.693
I want it in writing
that he wasn't promised anything.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.779
If he recants later, it may help.

29:42.030 --> 29:43.072
I'll take it to him.

29:57.712 --> 29:59.464
-[electronic voice] <i>Record at the tone.</i>
-[voicemail beeps]

29:59.547 --> 30:01.299
Hey, Keen, it's me.

30:01.382 --> 30:03.593
It's happening. Rakitin's agreed to talk.

30:03.676 --> 30:05.595
Cooper's about to take his statement.

30:05.678 --> 30:08.348
Look, this could be all over soon.

30:08.431 --> 30:10.558
I'll be there tonight. Bentham Park.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.741
It's a document you need to sign
before we start.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.202
It confirms your statement is voluntary.

30:30.245 --> 30:32.455
Listen to me. Look down.

30:33.039 --> 30:36.292
Underneath, there's something
I was asked to give you.

30:36.376 --> 30:38.086
Instructions from Reddington.

30:38.169 --> 30:39.671
Reddington sent you?

30:39.754 --> 30:42.215
[softly] Keep your voice down.
We don't have much time.

30:42.298 --> 30:44.342
He said it would give you instructions.

30:44.425 --> 30:47.971
-What kind of instructions?
-I don't know. I haven't read it.

30:48.054 --> 30:50.932
He was very clear.
Whatever it says is for your eyes only.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.892
When you're done, put it back.

30:59.148 --> 31:00.149
[scoffs]

31:01.609 --> 31:05.113
What the hell is this? Some kind of joke?

31:05.196 --> 31:06.239
Huh?

31:06.322 --> 31:09.742
Okay, well, I don't know
what kind of games you're playing,

31:09.826 --> 31:15.415
but, uh, next time you see Reddington,
you can tell him to go to hell.

31:16.624 --> 31:18.334
I'm ready to talk.

31:21.212 --> 31:23.965
[door opens, then closes]

31:26.634 --> 31:31.347
Raymond, relax. It will work.

31:34.017 --> 31:35.727
I never wanted this.

31:38.062 --> 31:39.606
For any of them.

31:39.689 --> 31:42.317
Cooper, Park, Rakitin.

31:45.361 --> 31:46.487
Oh, boy.

31:47.363 --> 31:49.032
You saved Harold's life.

31:50.241 --> 31:51.701
It was the right choice.

31:54.913 --> 31:55.830
[Cooper] <i>Let's do this.</i>

31:56.414 --> 31:57.290
Bring him in.

32:01.127 --> 32:03.171
[suspenseful music playing]

32:19.187 --> 32:22.357
I'm Harold Cooper,
assistant director of the FBI.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.651
We're here with Mr. Andrew Patterson,

32:24.734 --> 32:27.612
also known by the code name Rakitin.

32:27.695 --> 32:29.697
You've been advised of your rights

32:29.781 --> 32:32.033
and have decided to make
a voluntary statement?

32:32.116 --> 32:33.743
[clears throat] That's correct.

32:33.826 --> 32:35.370
Tell us who you work for.

32:36.579 --> 32:37.497
Officially?

32:37.580 --> 32:41.751
The Office of Intelligence and Analysis,
a division of Homeland Security.

32:41.834 --> 32:45.755
Whoever delivers the envelope
must not touch the letter, understood?

32:45.838 --> 32:47.966
Under any circumstances. Any.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.550
And once he's handled it?

32:49.634 --> 32:50.969
[Klopp] <i>It won't take long.</i>

32:51.052 --> 32:54.681
Unofficially, you've been working as a
covert operative for Russian intelligence?

32:54.764 --> 32:57.475
[clears throat] For several years, yes.

32:57.558 --> 33:00.144
Specifically, the SVR. Among other groups.

33:00.228 --> 33:02.188
I'm gonna cut right to the chase.

33:02.271 --> 33:04.440
You're familiar with the fugitive
Raymond Reddington--?

33:04.524 --> 33:05.483
[choking]

33:07.151 --> 33:12.323
The agent is structurally similar
to the VX compound but more potent.

33:12.407 --> 33:14.325
I can't-- I can't breathe.

33:14.409 --> 33:16.244
Oh, my God. Get a medic here.

33:16.327 --> 33:17.829
Ressler, don't touch him.

33:17.912 --> 33:19.706
[gasping]

33:19.789 --> 33:22.834
Odorless. Evaporates much like water.

33:22.917 --> 33:26.254
The longer he touches the letter,
the faster the toxin will have its effect.

33:26.337 --> 33:30.008
Code black. Code black.
This is Agent Mojtabai in the War Room.

33:30.091 --> 33:31.884
Get a med team in here now!

33:41.185 --> 33:43.229
[dramatic music playing]

33:43.855 --> 33:44.689
[Cooper] Fine.

33:44.772 --> 33:47.734
Reddington's in the building.
He's on his way.

33:47.817 --> 33:48.818
He's here?

33:48.901 --> 33:53.364
I think I know, but what exactly
are we saying just happened?

33:53.448 --> 33:54.782
-Cynthia.
-He killed that man.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.034
Is that what we're saying?

33:56.117 --> 33:59.287
Reddington somehow got to him
and murdered our witness in front of us?

33:59.370 --> 34:02.040
What's the alternative?
Natural causes? He was poisoned.

34:02.123 --> 34:04.667
How? He's been in custody
and isolated for hours.

34:04.751 --> 34:08.129
-He was fine a few minutes ago.
-I don't know.

34:08.212 --> 34:10.465
Maybe the medical examiner
can help us understand how.

34:10.548 --> 34:12.300
I'll tell you, if he did it,

34:12.383 --> 34:16.054
that smug son of a bitch has a set
of Rocky Mountain oysters.

34:16.137 --> 34:19.640
And to walk in here right after?
Would he do that?

34:23.436 --> 34:25.605
Agent Park. Going down or up?

34:25.688 --> 34:27.815
I killed him. Rakitin's dead.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.275
You didn't kill anyone.

34:29.358 --> 34:32.779
I told you, whatever happened
was my doing, not yours.

34:32.862 --> 34:34.489
I'm an accessory to murder.

34:34.572 --> 34:37.617
Interesting. I don't recall you
being so concerned

34:37.700 --> 34:41.079
about the idea when you thought
Mr. Dieterle was being killed.

34:41.162 --> 34:43.247
They'll investigate.
We won't get away with it.

34:43.331 --> 34:46.417
Nonsense. Can they prove
you gave Rakitin the letter?

34:47.877 --> 34:48.711
No.

34:48.795 --> 34:50.088
And the letter now?

34:51.422 --> 34:52.381
I have it.

34:52.465 --> 34:55.343
Then I suggest you light a match
and destroy it.

34:55.426 --> 34:56.928
Carefully, of course.

34:58.387 --> 35:00.098
I have to tell Cooper.

35:00.723 --> 35:02.725
Now, that would be ironic.

35:03.309 --> 35:07.313
You got into this mess because you didn't
wanna end your career and go to prison.

35:07.396 --> 35:09.816
What do you think will happen
if you confess now?

35:41.389 --> 35:42.807
[knocking on door]

35:44.517 --> 35:45.810
Cynthia.

35:45.893 --> 35:47.687
I didn't know you were here.

35:47.770 --> 35:52.650
I came by to see how
Harold's interrogation was progressing,

35:52.733 --> 35:56.737
but it appears things have taken
a most surprising turn.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.448
-Did you kill him?
-Harold.

36:00.283 --> 36:01.367
I'm asking you.

36:03.327 --> 36:05.163
You're certain he was murdered?

36:06.080 --> 36:08.541
I once knew a team of Chechens,

36:08.624 --> 36:14.255
all seven had a ricin bean
embedded in a hollowed-out rear molar--

36:14.338 --> 36:16.132
It's just a game to you, isn't it?

36:16.883 --> 36:18.092
A game?

36:19.343 --> 36:21.179
I warned you, Harold.

36:21.804 --> 36:26.434
I explicitly told you that pursuing this
could prove to be deadly.

36:26.517 --> 36:28.519
I told you I'm not afraid of your threats.

36:28.603 --> 36:30.688
But you should be afraid.

36:32.398 --> 36:36.277
I saved you today.
But what about tomorrow?

36:36.360 --> 36:39.655
Do you really think
the people who Rakitin worked for

36:39.739 --> 36:43.159
will just allow you to expose them?

36:43.242 --> 36:44.368
So he was killed.

36:46.078 --> 36:47.580
I'm not your enemy.

36:48.539 --> 36:50.708
And whether you believe it or not,

36:50.791 --> 36:52.335
you are both safer today

36:52.418 --> 36:55.379
because you didn't hear
what Rakitin had to say.

36:57.173 --> 36:59.592
[Panabaker]<i> We're launching</i>
<i>an investigation.</i>

36:59.675 --> 37:02.428
<i>If it proves you were involved,</i>
<i>you have my word,</i>

37:02.511 --> 37:06.557
<i>we will invalidate your immunity deal</i>
<i>and you will go to prison.</i>

37:06.641 --> 37:09.018
[Raymond] <i>So you think someone got to him?</i>

37:09.101 --> 37:10.144
<i>Could be.</i>

37:10.728 --> 37:14.190
Though if you're right, it would have
to have been one of your own people.

37:16.192 --> 37:19.612
If I were you, I'd run
with the ricin-bean-in-the-molar theory.

37:20.404 --> 37:22.740
Speaking of running,
I have an appointment.

37:23.407 --> 37:25.409
Please, excuse me.

37:40.299 --> 37:42.927
To the artist formerly known as Rakitin.

37:45.429 --> 37:47.139
He was an artist, Raymond.
