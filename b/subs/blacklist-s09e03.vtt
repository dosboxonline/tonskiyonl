00:01.001 --> 00:02.836
[dramatic music playing]

00:10.427 --> 00:13.430
[in Italian] Forgive my delay, Your Grace.

00:14.014 --> 00:17.809
I had to push through a crowd outside.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.812
The Sacra Cintola is a treasure.

00:20.895 --> 00:24.441
On the rare days we put it on display,

00:24.524 --> 00:26.943
<i>everyone wants a peek.</i>

00:27.777 --> 00:30.447
-[in English] Has the mayor arrived?
-In the chapel, with the bishop.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.824
No shooting, right? That was our deal.

00:32.907 --> 00:34.325
That's our deal.

00:34.409 --> 00:35.702
[grunts]

00:39.581 --> 00:41.207
[bishop in Italian]
<i>When the Mother of God,</i>

00:41.291 --> 00:44.461
the ever Virgin Mary,
was called to heaven,

00:44.544 --> 00:47.422
she handed her Holy Belt to St. Thomas

00:47.505 --> 00:50.800
as proof of her divine ascension.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.261
We've protected it ever since.

01:01.644 --> 01:02.979
It is holy.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.650
[dramatic music playing]

01:08.401 --> 01:10.403
[in English] Give it to me,
the relic. Now!

01:10.487 --> 01:13.740
Please, this is not what God
wants for your lives.

01:13.823 --> 01:16.201
Idolaters know nothing of what God wants.

01:16.284 --> 01:17.494
[gunshot]

01:19.954 --> 01:21.498
You can't. It's sacred.

01:21.581 --> 01:24.167
It is sacred.
Which is why it needs to be destroyed.

01:37.305 --> 01:39.307
[man] The investor will come through.
Do not worry.

01:39.390 --> 01:40.350
I'm not worried.

01:40.433 --> 01:43.603
I know how these money men work.
If he didn't say no, it means yes.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.313
Soon, he will hand you a big check,

01:45.396 --> 01:47.857
and everyone will buy
your fancy new security system.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.859
It's a security software suite.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.278
Whatever. Everyone will buy it.

01:52.362 --> 01:55.907
Soon, you can forget about
all these lost years of your life.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.952
-The FBI can find a new desk clerk.
-Hush, Hashem.

01:59.035 --> 02:01.538
Aram can't talk about his work,

02:02.163 --> 02:03.832
but I'm sure it's important,

02:04.624 --> 02:07.043
even if it does wash out his complexion.

02:07.585 --> 02:10.088
How do you like being back at work, <i>motek?</i>

02:10.171 --> 02:14.092
It's weird. I thought I'd closed
the door on this part of my life,

02:14.175 --> 02:17.679
but it's great to see the team
and a paycheck doesn't hurt.

02:17.762 --> 02:21.850
Paychecks are the shackles
of the common man, remember that.

02:21.933 --> 02:24.102
Wait till you are running
your own company.

02:24.185 --> 02:27.313
Ooh. Maybe you'll be on <i>Shark Tank.</i>

02:28.106 --> 02:29.607
I gotta go, um...

02:30.150 --> 02:32.735
Thank you for breakfast.

02:32.819 --> 02:36.197
I will call you guys and talk to you soon.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.117
Do not worry. The money, it will come.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.618
[Aram] Not worried!

02:41.369 --> 02:44.831
Have you thought about this?
She's 11, you're a fugitive.

02:44.914 --> 02:47.876
But she doesn't know that.
She wouldn't see that.

02:47.959 --> 02:51.838
Children see behavior,
good or bad, kind or cruel.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.632
I'm confident Agnes will...

02:55.967 --> 02:57.135
see me.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.013
I won't lie to her.

03:00.805 --> 03:03.099
Do you let her believe in Santa Claus?

03:03.182 --> 03:05.935
-I let her believe in myths.
-If the shoe fits...

03:08.104 --> 03:10.064
I want to be in her life.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.070
I know it's hard and that you mean well.

03:16.946 --> 03:19.449
Let me talk to Charlene,
I'll see what she says.

03:22.994 --> 03:26.831
What do you know about
the Supremo Priori Knighthood?

03:27.373 --> 03:30.126
-Never heard of them.
-I'm not surprised.

03:30.209 --> 03:32.253
For generations, they've been

03:32.795 --> 03:36.424
a rather toothless group
of religious extremists.

03:36.507 --> 03:39.802
And you're telling me about them
because that's no longer the case.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.138
They recently killed an innocent man

03:42.222 --> 03:46.142
during the armed robbery
of the Sacra Cintola.

03:46.768 --> 03:47.769
Mary's Holy Belt?

03:47.852 --> 03:51.147
Another in a growing list
of stolen iconography

03:51.231 --> 03:53.816
they've put on the illicit auction block.

03:54.525 --> 03:57.362
The belt will soon be available
to the highest bidder.

03:57.445 --> 03:59.030
When and where is the auction?

03:59.113 --> 04:00.156
Mm...

04:00.907 --> 04:02.408
Let me worry about that.

04:02.492 --> 04:06.079
I suggest you do some homework on the SPK,

04:06.162 --> 04:09.165
be prepared for whatever comes.

04:09.999 --> 04:12.252
[Cooper] Muhammad's footprint
from Istanbul,

04:12.335 --> 04:14.754
the Buddha's tooth from Sri Lanka,

04:14.837 --> 04:17.632
in Cologne, Germany,
bones belonging to the Three Wise Men,

04:17.715 --> 04:19.342
all stolen by the SPK,

04:19.425 --> 04:22.178
then, according to Reddington,
sold on the black market.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.056
No way. I mean,
those things aren't real, right?

04:25.139 --> 04:26.891
Authenticity is irrelevant.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.435
Belief makes them real and holy.

04:29.519 --> 04:33.523
Initially, the SPK operated like thieves
in the night, but they've turned violent.

04:33.606 --> 04:37.819
Two days ago, they killed a security guard
inside a cathedral in Prato, Italy,

04:37.902 --> 04:40.905
during the armed robbery
of a 2000-year-old belt

04:40.989 --> 04:43.408
-worn by the Virgin Mary.
-Allegedly.

04:43.491 --> 04:47.412
Did Reddington say what turned
a secret society into armed robbers?

04:47.495 --> 04:48.913
[Cooper] <i>Not what, but who.</i>

04:48.997 --> 04:51.541
<i>A new leader known only as Giovanni.</i>

04:51.624 --> 04:53.001
[Aram]<i> If these are true believers,</i>

04:53.084 --> 04:56.462
<i>they'd want to possess the relics,</i>
<i>not auction them off.</i>

04:56.546 --> 04:58.798
[Ressler] <i>As usual, two plus two</i>
<i>equals five.</i>

05:00.591 --> 05:02.427
What's Reddington not telling us?

05:03.720 --> 05:04.554
I don't know.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.639
Don't know or won't say?

05:07.515 --> 05:09.475
Agent Ressler, that'll be enough.

05:09.559 --> 05:12.687
I'm sorry, but Dembe
didn't just work for Reddington.

05:12.770 --> 05:15.481
He was his sworn protector,
his closest friend.

05:15.565 --> 05:18.651
Now we're supposed to just
accept him as one of ours?

05:18.735 --> 05:21.195
Until he gives us a reason not to, yes.

05:22.739 --> 05:26.868
Agent Zuma, you and Agent Mojtabai
will go to the cathedral in Prato.

05:26.951 --> 05:29.579
Vatican agreed to share
what they found at the crime scene.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.497
You two, be careful out there.

05:32.123 --> 05:34.000
Your FBI reinstatements won't be official

05:34.083 --> 05:36.335
until Health Services
administers a drug test.

05:36.419 --> 05:39.297
I took mine last week.
I'll have them arrange yours next.

05:39.380 --> 05:43.718
On that note, you should know that I met
with an angel investor about my company,

05:43.801 --> 05:47.013
and, well, shockingly, he...

05:47.513 --> 05:48.890
he might be interested.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.225
So you're leaving us
for the private sector again?

05:51.309 --> 05:53.770
I appreciate you mentioning it.
If it happens,

05:53.853 --> 05:56.147
I'll support whatever decision you make.

05:56.230 --> 05:58.691
Until then, let's take down the SPK.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.654
This is where the thieves entered
and stabbed the guard.

06:03.738 --> 06:05.656
Antonio was found dead here.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.534
No CCTV cameras.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.286
I have stills from the crime scene.

06:10.912 --> 06:14.373
-Is this door keyed on the outside?
-No. It can only be opened from inside.

06:14.457 --> 06:15.917
We're operating on a theory

06:16.000 --> 06:18.169
that a crew member
was already in the building.

06:18.252 --> 06:21.464
You're right, and that crew member
was your own guard.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.800
His weapon is still holstered.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.344
If he felt threatened, it wouldn't be.

06:26.969 --> 06:30.181
If our guard was helping the intruders,
why would they kill him?

06:30.890 --> 06:34.769
-Hard to say. Things go wrong.
-If your guard was the inside man,

06:34.852 --> 06:37.855
there may be a money trail
we can follow back to the SPK.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.733
I'll see what I can find
in his financial records.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.861
Remember, you're not an agent.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.864
If something happens,
leave the fun stuff to me.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.908
You got a weird definition of "fun."

06:51.702 --> 06:54.455
-[Park] David Kangas?
-That's right.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.582
Agent Park, FBI.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.794
I'd like to speak to you about
a transaction you made,

06:59.877 --> 07:01.963
wiring 50,000 euros to a man in Italy.

07:02.046 --> 07:04.674
I'm a business manager.
My firm moves all kinds of money.

07:04.757 --> 07:08.511
I don't remember each transaction,
but if you'd like to visit my office...

07:08.594 --> 07:10.513
Maybe we can prompt your memory.

07:10.596 --> 07:14.559
Antonio Lucchese was a guard
for the Santa Maria de Prato Cathedral.

07:14.642 --> 07:18.771
We believe the money you transferred
was payment for his role in a robbery.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.524
I have no knowledge
of any criminal activity.

07:21.607 --> 07:24.360
We're not suggesting you do.
Maybe one of your clients does.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.029
Have you ever heard of the SPK?

07:29.282 --> 07:30.575
[grunts]

07:30.658 --> 07:32.452
[Ressler] Stop! Stop!

07:39.208 --> 07:40.460
Kangas, get out here!

07:40.543 --> 07:43.337
"Worthy is the lamb who was slain."
I am worthy!

07:43.421 --> 07:46.340
-Jesus, you having fun yet?
-Honor and glory are mine!

07:46.883 --> 07:48.301
[screaming]

07:55.349 --> 07:56.476
[auctioneer] Do I hear 650?

07:56.559 --> 08:01.981
Last chance to own your own ZPU-2
twin-barrel anti-aircraft gun.

08:02.064 --> 08:06.194
No one can run or fly from you
when you are sitting in this bad boy.

08:06.277 --> 08:09.238
Shock and awe your friends
and enemies alike.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.740
Going once.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.325
Twice.

08:12.408 --> 08:15.661
Sold to the lady in red for 600,000.

08:16.454 --> 08:19.332
May your revenge
be as daring as your neckline.

08:19.415 --> 08:20.416
[gasps]

08:20.500 --> 08:24.545
And now a Galilean fashion accessory

08:24.629 --> 08:27.006
once worn by the OG Madonna herself.

08:27.089 --> 08:28.174
I give you...

08:28.716 --> 08:30.676
-the Sacra Cintola.
-[woman gasps]

08:30.760 --> 08:34.222
Nothing says heavenly style
like a camel hair belt

08:34.305 --> 08:37.350
encased in gold, silver, and rock crystal.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.811
The bidding commences at 2 million.

08:40.895 --> 08:41.812
I have two.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.565
I have three. Thank you, sir.

08:44.649 --> 08:47.235
Four? Can I get four?

08:47.318 --> 08:48.152
I have four.

08:48.819 --> 08:49.862
Do I hear five?

08:50.404 --> 08:54.450
The Virgin Mary was riding
a tractor beam up to God

08:54.534 --> 08:56.244
when she dropped this beauty.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.496
It is a bargain at 4 million.

08:58.579 --> 09:01.207
-How about 4.5?
-Five, if you close the bidding now.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.709
Sold to the gentleman.

09:06.045 --> 09:06.879
[chimes]

09:06.963 --> 09:08.381
[auctioneer] Your funds cleared.

09:09.173 --> 09:13.177
Congratulations, you are now
the proud owner of biblical history.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.095
[Raymond] Yeah.

09:15.346 --> 09:19.433
Actually, Mother Mary's chastity belt
is of no interest to me.

09:19.517 --> 09:23.354
I only bought the heirloom
to gain access to something that is.

09:23.437 --> 09:28.192
The name of the client
who entrusted you with the Sacra Cintola.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.612
I'm sure you can appreciate
the need for confidentiality.

09:31.696 --> 09:37.243
I can. Which is why I brought
this bauble for your auction.

09:46.335 --> 09:48.296
-Is this...?
-One of the seven.

09:49.171 --> 09:52.592
Selling it would offset
my latest expenditure.

09:53.134 --> 09:57.179
More to the point,
your cut of the sale would be...

09:57.888 --> 10:00.182
well, low seven figures.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.767
If I give you the name?

10:01.851 --> 10:04.854
What? And arrange
for a meeting between us.

10:06.063 --> 10:08.149
That's not how I conduct business.

10:08.232 --> 10:09.275
Hm.

10:10.526 --> 10:14.614
Trevor, I'm not leaving here
without the meeting.

10:14.697 --> 10:18.200
You can either profit
from giving it to me,

10:18.284 --> 10:20.995
or get hurt, then give it to me.

10:24.332 --> 10:27.960
David was a wonderful husband,
a kind father.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.630
He was very... normal.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.882
So, what happened to him?

10:32.965 --> 10:34.800
The Supremo Priori Knighthood.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.720
David said they're a fraternity,
like the Shriners.

10:38.429 --> 10:42.266
I thought it would be good for him,
fellowship with Christian men.

10:42.350 --> 10:45.478
-How could I know it was a cult?
-A cult? What do you mean?

10:45.561 --> 10:49.023
I mean, a religious devotion
to a manipulative leader

10:49.106 --> 10:52.401
who turned my husband into a... martyr.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.944
Did he tell you where they met?

10:54.028 --> 10:58.282
No. But when his behavior changed,
I started tracking his cell phone.

10:58.366 --> 11:02.787
I'd do anything to catch the madman
who did this to my husband.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.706
[man] <i>Wake up.</i>

11:05.790 --> 11:07.541
Wake up.

11:07.625 --> 11:11.337
Biblical prophecies
are unfolding before our very eyes.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.881
Oceans rising, rivers receding,

11:14.423 --> 11:16.384
the whole damn Earth's on fire.

11:16.467 --> 11:21.597
Yet we await a Second Coming
that has not come.

11:21.680 --> 11:22.598
Why?

11:22.681 --> 11:25.643
Because people
are too busy worshipping the past

11:25.726 --> 11:27.478
to see what's happening right now.

11:27.561 --> 11:30.648
Only through the destruction
of their ancient idols

11:30.731 --> 11:33.234
are we able to open their eyes

11:33.317 --> 11:35.903
so they may see their way
to the kingdom of heaven.

11:35.986 --> 11:38.030
-Amen.
-Amen.

11:38.114 --> 11:41.492
But in order to do that,
we must be welcome.

11:41.575 --> 11:45.121
The senseless murder
of that poor security guard in Italy

11:45.204 --> 11:47.832
set our cause back immeasurably.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.458
And he was one of us.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.086
He contributed
to the furtherance of our cause.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.130
And you killed him.

11:55.172 --> 11:56.382
Shame on you.

11:57.174 --> 12:00.678
Death and violence are not the way
to righteous change.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.513
What is the way, Giovanni?

12:03.264 --> 12:06.267
We keep destroying their relics,
and they just keep covering it up.

12:06.350 --> 12:09.228
Be patient, Brother Colfax.
Our message will get out eventually.

12:09.311 --> 12:10.855
It's out right now.

12:10.938 --> 12:14.442
The press is talking about us.
It's time to make a move.

12:14.525 --> 12:15.484
Like what?

12:16.110 --> 12:19.196
Let's not steal from another church.
Let's take down a church.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.407
-Amen.
-[man] Amen, brother.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.033
-[applauding]
-[Giovanni] That's enough.

12:23.742 --> 12:26.370
There will be no more violence.
Do you understand?

12:27.079 --> 12:32.084
We must all aspire to be
more like John the Baptist,

12:32.626 --> 12:36.338
who peacefully paved the way
for the return of the Messiah.

12:37.548 --> 12:40.926
And that is why, as an inspiration,

12:41.427 --> 12:43.762
I have chosen as our next target...

12:46.640 --> 12:48.642
the head of John the Baptist.

12:49.268 --> 12:53.564
It is to be venerated at the Old
Holy Cross Church tomorrow afternoon.

12:53.647 --> 12:54.773
[cell phone buzzes]

12:54.857 --> 12:58.402
Now it's time for us to take
a moment or two of reflection.

12:58.486 --> 13:01.322
Everyone, take a breather,
stretch your legs,

13:01.405 --> 13:06.452
and when I return, I'll share with you
how I plan to steal that head.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.626
Yeah? How much did we get for this one?

13:13.709 --> 13:15.503
Double the appraisal price.

13:15.586 --> 13:19.173
Which is why I'm sending my colleague
to transfer your funds in person.

13:19.256 --> 13:21.008
Can you meet him tomorrow for lunch?

13:21.091 --> 13:23.928
-Can you assure me of his discretion?
<i>-I promise.</i>

13:24.011 --> 13:26.931
<i>The man I'm sending</i>
<i>won't speak of this to anyone.</i>

13:27.014 --> 13:27.848
Thank you.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.816
Didn't this just get way more interesting?

13:40.361 --> 13:42.947
The meek and scheming Robert Vesco

13:43.572 --> 13:46.909
masquerading as the great
and powerful Giovanni.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.704
-Excuse me?
-Yes, sir?

13:50.788 --> 13:52.623
What is your most expensive wine?

13:52.706 --> 13:58.087
We have a Château le Pin,
Pomerol 2001, which is $5800.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.297
We'll take two. On his tab.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.967
Which is $50 million in arrears.

14:04.760 --> 14:05.719
So...

14:06.428 --> 14:07.304
the scam.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.098
Tell me about it.

14:17.731 --> 14:18.983
[knocking on door]

14:19.775 --> 14:21.151
Hey. Ready to brief the team?

14:21.235 --> 14:24.488
Soon as I give Health Services
what they're here for.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.866
Shouldn't be hard.
You drank half of the Potomac.

14:26.949 --> 14:30.369
I did research.
I found where Kangas goes at night.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.915
What? I like to hydrate.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.334
You know, gingers tend to wrinkle.

14:38.919 --> 14:44.800
Oh, you have no idea how hard it is
to manage a decent heist crew.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.720
-The bickering, the squabbling...
-[Raymond] The fragile egos.

14:47.803 --> 14:52.516
The safecracker who feels like
he's worth more than the gadget guy.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.727
Who thinks he's smarter
than the mastermind.

14:54.810 --> 14:58.147
Who just wants to go back
to the salad days of being a driver.

14:58.647 --> 15:01.775
But you, instead of
teaching criminals to be brothers,

15:01.859 --> 15:05.279
you turned a fraternity
of brothers into criminals.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.740
-Mm.
-How did you con them

15:07.823 --> 15:09.366
into stealing for you?

15:09.450 --> 15:10.534
Profit sharing?

15:10.618 --> 15:12.036
No.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.203
Storytelling.

15:13.913 --> 15:17.583
They want the end of the world.
I simply pour fuel on their fantasies.

15:18.167 --> 15:21.378
Train them to connect
holy relics with idolatry.

15:21.462 --> 15:24.173
They believe that what we steal
is burned at the altar.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.967
But you perform a little...
sleight of hand.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.220
Foot, actually,
which preserves the relics,

15:30.304 --> 15:32.473
<i>and then I sell them at auction.</i>

15:32.556 --> 15:34.642
Your own secret society.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.018
Where can I get one?

15:36.101 --> 15:39.396
-You must teach me the secret handshake.
-Hm.

15:40.064 --> 15:43.484
I won't deny it has been
comically lucrative.

15:44.401 --> 15:47.655
But it hasn't been all fun and games.

15:47.738 --> 15:50.032
The security guard at the cathedral.

15:50.115 --> 15:52.660
Yes, I know, I know. That poor man.

15:53.494 --> 15:57.206
I've never used violence
in pursuit of illicit gain.

15:57.289 --> 16:00.626
But I should've been there
to keep my boys in check.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.963
But to tell you the truth,
at my age, after a long flight,

16:04.046 --> 16:07.675
my ankles can just swell up
like balloons and I'm useless.

16:07.758 --> 16:10.302
I would suggest compression socks.

16:10.386 --> 16:14.932
I'd also suggest you shut down
this con, Robert, while you still can.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.809
I'm way ahead of you, Raymond.

16:16.892 --> 16:19.812
I've already decided to cut bait,
after they steal that head.

16:19.895 --> 16:22.064
And if another body drops?

16:22.147 --> 16:25.067
Not to worry, I've laid down the law.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.736
I've got my boys under control.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.490
Each IED contains a main charge,
an arming switch,

16:31.573 --> 16:34.284
and a battery pack
connected to an RC receiver.

16:34.368 --> 16:37.204
What's going on? You heard Giovanni.
He doesn't want this.

16:37.913 --> 16:40.040
Giovanni doesn't know what he wants.

16:40.124 --> 16:43.085
-When do you plan to detonate these?
-At the end of mass today.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.462
When the bishop raises
the head of John the Baptist,

16:45.546 --> 16:48.340
we'll blast open the gates of heaven
for all the world to see.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.426
You'll blow these
with people in the church?

16:50.509 --> 16:52.511
[Colfax] The Bible is full of judgment
and bloodshed.

16:52.594 --> 16:54.096
Everyone will die for a cause.

16:54.179 --> 16:56.473
-Giovanni needs to know about this.
-Wait.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.225
[grunts]

17:03.022 --> 17:07.359
I've enjoyed catching up, Raymond,
but now I must go and tend to my flock.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.028
Your flock can wait.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.280
We have unfinished business.

17:11.780 --> 17:15.159
Are talking about
that De La Cruz job a few years back?

17:15.242 --> 17:17.161
"Little De La Cruz job"?

17:17.244 --> 17:20.080
That was a hundred million
in Spanish gold,

17:20.164 --> 17:23.917
and you blew town
like a Texas twister with all of it.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.503
Is this where you tell me
about honor among thieves?

17:26.587 --> 17:29.631
No. It's where I tell you
that you'll pay your debt.

17:30.966 --> 17:35.262
Well, in order to do that,
I'd have to go to my bank in Malta

17:35.345 --> 17:38.640
and, well, to approve
a transfer of that size.

17:38.724 --> 17:39.767
Perfect.

17:39.850 --> 17:43.020
While I don't have a secret society,
I do have a jet.

17:43.103 --> 17:46.440
-We're going to Malta.
-You didn't even know I'd be here.

17:46.523 --> 17:49.193
You're right. I have changed.

17:49.818 --> 17:53.489
I used to think that I had
to create my own fate.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.407
Now I believe in karma.

17:55.491 --> 17:57.367
Even if it is a bitch.

17:58.994 --> 18:01.538
Remove any outer garments
that might conceal items

18:01.622 --> 18:04.041
that could tamper your urine sample.

18:04.124 --> 18:07.252
Anything else in your
pants' pockets goes in the bowl.

18:07.336 --> 18:11.507
I know you're just doing your job,
but, FYI, we've both been agents.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.966
We're not gonna cheat.

18:13.050 --> 18:15.052
Void directly into the container.

18:15.135 --> 18:18.639
Do not flush afterwards.
You have four minutes.

18:22.976 --> 18:24.103
Okay, here we go.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.271
It's funny.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.150
This is awkward.

18:30.901 --> 18:33.237
I should've had more to drink. I just--

18:33.320 --> 18:35.906
I feel like I've been
retaining a lot of water lately.

18:35.989 --> 18:38.534
I'm feeling, um, bloated.

18:40.035 --> 18:41.870
[Aram] Okay, that's my phone.

18:42.746 --> 18:46.333
I know the ring tone is embarrassing,
but, at this moment, what isn't?

18:46.416 --> 18:47.626
I need to answer it.

18:47.709 --> 18:50.087
No personal items in the stall.

18:50.170 --> 18:53.507
It's important. Can you pick it up
and put it on speaker?

18:53.590 --> 18:54.842
I can't miss this.

18:57.469 --> 18:58.595
[Nick] <i>We did it.</i>

18:58.679 --> 19:01.682
No way. He said yes?
The money came through?

to tech fame and fortune.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.574
That's great news, congratulations.

There are still I's to be dotted
and T's to be crossed,

19:22.202 --> 19:25.539
but, yeah, it is kind of exciting.

19:25.622 --> 19:28.041
But I'm not going anywhere just yet.

19:28.125 --> 19:32.254
Later, we'll celebrate and figure out
a way to help you spend your money.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.548
Now we need to focus. Where are we on SPK?

19:34.631 --> 19:37.009
The burn victim's wife couldn't
give us anything concrete.

19:37.092 --> 19:39.553
But she was worried enough
about her husband's behavior

19:39.636 --> 19:42.055
to start tracking his phone
when he went out at night.

19:42.139 --> 19:45.267
He always parked in the same public lot,
then he'd turn off his phone.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.519
Generic buildings,
no conspicuous occupants.

19:47.603 --> 19:48.770
At least not now.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.733
This is the same block in 1868,
the year the SPK was founded.

19:52.816 --> 19:55.068
One of these three buildings remains.

19:55.152 --> 19:58.447
And what it was, and still is,
an American Legion Hall.

19:59.406 --> 20:02.826
So you have any groups
that meet here on a regular basis?

20:02.910 --> 20:05.370
Yeah, you mean the Arthritics.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.122
Our senior heavy metal band.

20:07.706 --> 20:10.834
[chuckles] I don't care much
for their sounds.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.921
But I'll let you boys look around, okay?

20:15.923 --> 20:20.344
Sure doesn't look like the home base
for heavily armed religious extremists.

20:21.678 --> 20:25.015
Maybe they are hiding in plain sight.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.060
Something you know about, huh?

20:32.981 --> 20:33.857
This mirror...

20:35.150 --> 20:37.945
is a reproduction of the Porta Magica.

20:39.196 --> 20:42.824
A monument built in 1680
in Piazza Vittorio.

20:42.908 --> 20:43.742
So?

20:45.118 --> 20:45.953
So...

20:46.453 --> 20:49.581
the Magic Portal isn't a mirror.

20:50.624 --> 20:51.583
It's a door.

20:52.501 --> 20:55.379
They say alchemists used it
to vanish from our world.

21:08.308 --> 21:11.061
-Reddington teach you that trick?
-Yes.

21:11.645 --> 21:14.898
He showed me the real Porta Magica in Rome
and told me the story.

21:14.982 --> 21:16.358
He taught you well.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.694
I wish we knew
if he was still teaching you.

21:18.777 --> 21:22.197

I'll tell you what, Raymond.

22:27.429 --> 22:31.141
If we skip Malta, I'll deal you in
on a little plan I've hatched

worth ten times as much.

I do.

Señor Cooper.

22:39.816 --> 22:40.650
Thank you.

22:42.235 --> 22:44.654
Harold. So you've spoken with Charlene.

22:44.738 --> 22:45.572
I have.

22:45.655 --> 22:48.200
And I got her to agree
to let you see Agnes.

22:48.283 --> 22:49.201
Wonderful.

22:49.284 --> 22:50.702
As long as I'm present.

22:53.747 --> 22:54.581
Present.

22:55.791 --> 22:56.958
Present how?

22:57.042 --> 22:59.503
She won't agree to let you and Agnes
be alone together.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.505
She wants the visits to be supervised.

23:01.588 --> 23:04.257
I'm not an abusive husband or father.

23:04.341 --> 23:06.259
You're a cold-hearted murderer.

I appreciate it, Harold,
and I'll consider it.

They're about to blow up a church

23:33.870 --> 23:34.871
I don't believe it.

Belief is your problem, Robert.

23:37.582 --> 23:38.708
Or the lack of it.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.919
It's why you didn't see this coming.

23:41.878 --> 23:43.380
Well, in my defense,

23:44.131 --> 23:46.216
it's very difficult
to maintain good judgment

23:46.299 --> 23:48.802
when your followers think
you're channeling God.

23:48.885 --> 23:50.470
What am I going to do?

23:50.554 --> 23:52.514
I've never lost control of a con before.

23:52.597 --> 23:53.849
Stay calm.

23:54.766 --> 23:56.309
Happens to the best of us.

23:56.393 --> 23:57.811
Or so I'm told.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.188
A church full of innocent people.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.399
I can't bear to have
that stain on my soul.

24:02.482 --> 24:04.401
What do you know of the plan?

24:04.484 --> 24:05.986
Is there a staging area?

24:06.069 --> 24:07.612
I scouted one for them.

24:07.696 --> 24:09.489
Then that's where we're going.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.409
[Ressler] The church is full of people.

24:12.492 --> 24:14.703
The service was already underway
when you called.

24:14.786 --> 24:17.372
We've initiated a lockdown
but held off on emergency evac.

24:17.455 --> 24:19.958
Good. The bombers are watching
a live broadcast.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.918
We don't want to alert them.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.295
Just cut the feed.

24:23.378 --> 24:25.755
The moment we do that,
they'll blow the church.

24:25.839 --> 24:27.132
[Dembe] According to their notes,

24:27.215 --> 24:30.552
we have until the bishop raises John
the Baptist's head to save these people.

24:30.635 --> 24:33.597
[priest] "Give to the king thy judgment,
O God.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.932
To the king's son, thy justice."

24:36.808 --> 24:38.977
[Aram]<i> I looked over the schematics</i>
<i>from the SPK base.</i>

24:39.060 --> 24:41.605
<i>Looks like they've rigged IEDs</i>
<i>with RF triggers</i>

24:41.688 --> 24:43.106
<i>and hidden them under the pews.</i>

24:43.190 --> 24:46.735
<i>If I can get a close look at one</i>
<i>and determine its frequency,</i>

24:46.818 --> 24:48.820
<i>I should be able to jam the remote signal.</i>

24:48.904 --> 24:51.573
"...as showers falling gently
upon the Earth.

24:52.199 --> 24:55.118
In his days shall justice spring up,

24:55.202 --> 24:58.163
and abundance of peace
till the moon be taken away.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.208
And he shall rule from sea to sea,

25:01.791 --> 25:04.711
and from the river
unto the ends of the Earth."

25:08.673 --> 25:10.383
[beeping]

25:12.177 --> 25:13.929
Son of a bitch.

25:16.848 --> 25:20.268
Hey, Ressler, you're never gonna believe
what I just found.

25:20.352 --> 25:21.770
[Aram] <i>I saw one of the IEDs</i>

25:21.853 --> 25:24.397
but I can't get close enough
to determine its RF output

25:24.481 --> 25:26.983
without creating a scene.
Too many live TV cameras.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.485
[Ressler] Robert Vesco!

25:28.568 --> 25:31.738
The wanted fugitive
who faked his own death in Cuba.

25:31.821 --> 25:33.573
Reddington's friend, wasn't he?

25:33.657 --> 25:34.658
He was. Why?

25:34.741 --> 25:37.827
Because based on the fingerprints
on the SPK altar,

25:37.911 --> 25:39.329
that's who Giovanni is.

25:39.412 --> 25:41.665
But you already knew that, didn't you?

25:41.748 --> 25:43.500
Vesco is a conman. Not a killer.

25:43.583 --> 25:45.835
Reddington once sent us
to find Vesco, remember?

25:45.919 --> 25:49.589
Once we did, you and your boss
helped him get away with a fortune.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.758
Yes. Raymond did con you.

25:51.841 --> 25:53.885
-But then Vesco conned him.
-Hm.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.263
Maybe that's why he gave us this case.

25:56.346 --> 25:57.180
As payback.

25:57.264 --> 25:59.724
Or maybe he gave it to us
to help his old pal again.

25:59.808 --> 26:02.477
If we have his prints, so does everyone
in law enforcement.

26:02.560 --> 26:05.272
-How could that help him?
-Was hoping you could answer that.

26:05.355 --> 26:07.691
I can't and I don't have time
to make you believe me.

26:07.774 --> 26:10.610
Aram, I can get you a closer look
at those IEDs.

26:10.694 --> 26:11.736
Follow me.

26:15.699 --> 26:18.702
Just go in there and talk them down.

26:18.785 --> 26:22.038
I really think
this is more your area than mine.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.248
Can't you just--?

26:23.331 --> 26:24.457
Shoot them for you?

26:24.541 --> 26:25.709
No, I can't.

26:25.792 --> 26:27.794
There's a bomb, Robert.

26:27.877 --> 26:29.963
If I walk in, they'll set it off.

26:30.046 --> 26:31.798
What if they won't listen to me?

26:35.385 --> 26:38.263
You are Robert Vesco.

26:38.346 --> 26:40.015
King of the con.

26:40.640 --> 26:46.563
A swindling, cheating, double-crossing,
beautiful confidence man.

26:46.646 --> 26:47.564
Well--

26:50.567 --> 26:52.777
So put your game face on

26:52.861 --> 26:55.363
and get your damn marks under control.

26:58.867 --> 27:00.869
Thank you, Raymond. I needed that.

27:00.952 --> 27:01.911
You're welcome.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.080
Robert?

27:04.164 --> 27:05.790
If you try to run out on me again,

27:05.874 --> 27:08.418
I'll put you down
like a three-legged mule.

27:12.756 --> 27:17.344
<i>This is the Lamb of God</i>
<i>who takes away the sins of the world.</i>

27:17.427 --> 27:18.553
Get ready, boys.

27:19.220 --> 27:20.347
Any minute now.

27:22.432 --> 27:23.933
What's going on in here?

27:24.017 --> 27:27.312
Giovanni. You're just in time
for the fireworks.

27:27.395 --> 27:29.105
You disobeyed my orders.

27:29.773 --> 27:32.525
On the contrary,
we're doing what you taught us,

27:32.609 --> 27:34.110
paving the way for the Second Coming.

27:34.194 --> 27:36.154
Our goal was to prepare believers

27:36.237 --> 27:38.948
by turning them away
from material objects.

27:39.032 --> 27:42.035
To open their hearts and minds
to our spiritual nature.

27:42.535 --> 27:45.789
-How does mass murder accomplish that?
-Fear accomplishes that.

27:45.872 --> 27:46.748
[scoffs]

27:47.248 --> 27:50.085
Then you should be down on your knees
for fear of me, son.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.961
-Give me that detonator.
-No.

27:53.213 --> 27:54.714
You'll see we're right.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.383
We're gonna show you.

27:56.466 --> 27:58.218
If you do, I'll go to the police.

27:58.301 --> 28:01.513
Really? I just heard an APB
on a police scanner.

28:01.596 --> 28:03.640
Giovanni isn't Giovanni.

28:03.723 --> 28:08.061
His real name is Robert Vesco,
a fugitive wanted by the FBI.

28:14.401 --> 28:16.736
-[priest] We're running out of time.
-That's why we need it.

28:16.820 --> 28:17.904
[priest] An offering bag?

28:17.987 --> 28:20.698
There's a bomb in the church,
and you want an offering bag.

28:20.782 --> 28:21.616
Trust us.

28:21.699 --> 28:22.575
Please.

28:25.578 --> 28:28.206
-This should work.
-There's only one way to find out.

28:28.915 --> 28:29.874
Thank you.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.544

28:35.588 --> 28:37.090
-Harold Cooper.
<i>-</i> [ Raymond ] <i>Harold.</i>

28:37.173 --> 28:40.677
I've been thinking about your proposal
regarding Agnes.

28:40.760 --> 28:42.345
Now's not a good time.

28:42.429 --> 28:45.140
Because of the church bombing?
That's being taken care of.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.517
Not at the church it's not.
The pews are full.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.436
The bombs are live.
We have to diffuse them.

28:49.519 --> 28:52.147
The detonator's at an off-site location.

28:52.230 --> 28:53.690
I've spoken to Giovanni.

28:53.773 --> 28:56.151
<i>He's there now working</i>
<i>to resolve the situation.</i>

28:56.234 --> 28:57.861
I know Giovanni is Vesco,

28:57.944 --> 29:00.822
<i>so forgive me for not taking solace</i>
<i>in knowing he's on the case.</i>

29:00.905 --> 29:02.407
You and who else?

29:02.490 --> 29:03.992
Know about Vesco? Everyone.

Right after the offering.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.885
Please, call this off.

29:21.968 --> 29:23.428
You're doing it all for nothing.

29:23.511 --> 29:25.221
Can't you see that?

29:25.305 --> 29:27.307
You were just marks in a con.

29:27.974 --> 29:29.434
What con?

29:30.810 --> 29:33.813
If all your talk about the end times
was just talk,

29:33.897 --> 29:36.775
if you don't believe worshipping the past
is killing the future,

29:36.858 --> 29:39.611
why were we stealing relics
for you to destroy?

29:40.487 --> 29:42.447
Because he doesn't destroy them.

29:43.490 --> 29:48.578
He sells your precious antiquities
for a fortune on the black market.

29:49.162 --> 29:50.163
Who are you?

29:51.414 --> 29:53.333
I'm many things to many people.

29:53.416 --> 29:54.751
To Robert here?

29:54.834 --> 29:58.630
I'm a creditor who very much
needs him alive.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.674
To a man of the cloth such as yourself?

30:01.758 --> 30:03.343
I'm Yama.

30:03.426 --> 30:04.594
God of death.

30:09.974 --> 30:11.518
[Aram] Okay, this is the aisle.

30:11.601 --> 30:15.939
The IED I saw should be about four feet
from where you're standing.

30:16.022 --> 30:18.566
<i>I don't see it, but I know it's there.</i>

30:18.650 --> 30:19.859

30:21.569 --> 30:22.612
Stop. Stop.

30:26.324 --> 30:27.826
[Colfax]<i> Whoever you are, you're wrong.</i>

30:27.909 --> 30:29.077

We destroy them.

30:43.967 --> 30:45.510
His judgment will come.

30:46.845 --> 30:50.139
But today is your judgment day.

30:51.391 --> 30:53.935
I'm not an end timer by nature,

30:54.018 --> 30:58.439
and my idea of rapture is, of late,
a bit more solipsistic.

30:58.523 --> 31:02.277
But no matter what floats
one's funereal boat,

31:02.360 --> 31:07.073
you will be judged by what you do
in the next 60 seconds.

31:07.156 --> 31:11.911

I just need to match its markings
to its frequency.

31:20.461 --> 31:24.883
If you are the god of death,
our guns shouldn't be able to hurt you.

Not before.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.566
May almighty God bless this relic.

31:41.649 --> 31:43.818
I found the frequency. Found it.

31:59.042 --> 32:01.085
Raymond! You saved me.

32:02.378 --> 32:04.672
You're way past saving.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.257
I preserved you.

32:06.341 --> 32:08.468
An act of pure selfishness.

32:08.551 --> 32:12.513
Come. If we leave now,
we'll be in Malta before sunup.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.766
Still stuck on Malta?

32:14.849 --> 32:16.059
I'm telling you,

32:16.142 --> 32:19.270
we'll find bigger action
with the Salton Sea.

32:19.354 --> 32:21.064
[Aram] <i>Somebody's prayers were answered.</i>

32:21.147 --> 32:24.609
Or wasn't. Depending
on what you do or don't believe.

32:24.692 --> 32:26.611
Personally, I lean towards the idea that--

32:26.694 --> 32:27.737
Wu Xing.

32:27.820 --> 32:28.988
Remember him?

32:29.072 --> 32:31.074
Of course. That was my first case.

32:32.033 --> 32:33.368
I remember thinking...

32:34.118 --> 32:38.373
"Who is this weird guy
and why does he talk so much?"

32:38.456 --> 32:40.083
That's a nervous tic.

32:40.166 --> 32:43.419
I've been doing it
as long as I can remember.

32:43.503 --> 32:44.879
I start going and--

32:44.963 --> 32:47.882
I was trying to work my way up
to a compliment.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.968
Oh... Sorry.

32:52.178 --> 32:53.513
You forgot what it was?

32:53.596 --> 32:54.639
I do that all the time.

32:54.722 --> 32:57.558
If I think of something
and I don't say it right away, it's:

32:57.642 --> 32:58.476
It's gone.

32:58.559 --> 33:00.603
I-- Oh. Dang.

33:00.687 --> 33:01.771
Sorry. Again.

33:01.854 --> 33:02.730
It's okay.

33:02.814 --> 33:07.151
Because whatever this is,
this whole Aram-a-palooza thing...

33:08.027 --> 33:09.237
I'm gonna miss it.

33:12.073 --> 33:12.991
[Raymond] Lithium?

33:13.074 --> 33:14.659
[Robert] Yes, lithium.

33:14.742 --> 33:16.494
The Salton Sea's full of it.

33:16.577 --> 33:19.372
With all these electric cars,
there simply isn't enough of it.

33:20.456 --> 33:22.333
-Until now.
-Robert Vesco.

33:22.417 --> 33:25.712
I'm Special Agent Dembe Zuma, FBI.

33:25.795 --> 33:27.255
You're under arrest.

33:32.635 --> 33:33.678
[Raymond] I understand.

33:33.761 --> 33:36.597
You're new on the job.
You want to impress.

33:37.348 --> 33:39.809
But there are other factors at play.

33:39.892 --> 33:41.769
Fifty million factors, as I recall.

33:41.853 --> 33:45.857
And the SPK members
that he helped me to secure.

33:45.940 --> 33:48.276
They're in a warehouse near the church.

33:48.359 --> 33:50.111
It's a bit messy inside,

33:50.194 --> 33:53.781
but in fairness,
they did pull their weapons first.

33:54.365 --> 33:57.702
I knew you'd help him escape
so he could get you your money.

33:57.785 --> 33:59.328
Naturally. I get my money,

33:59.412 --> 34:02.749
the FBI saves a church full of people.

34:02.832 --> 34:06.544
I'll even throw in
the Sacra Cintola to sweeten the deal.

34:06.627 --> 34:08.588
It's good business for all.

34:08.671 --> 34:10.506
And if Vesco slips away?

34:10.590 --> 34:11.841
Oh, well.

34:11.924 --> 34:14.385
Nobody in the FBI will be any the wiser.

34:15.136 --> 34:16.596
I'm the FBI.

34:18.097 --> 34:20.725
Yes, you're an FBI agent.

34:21.768 --> 34:23.644
But loyalty,

34:23.728 --> 34:26.147
that's something else entirely.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.190
It is.

34:27.690 --> 34:30.193
And mine is constantly being questioned.

34:30.276 --> 34:33.488
Because your feet are planted
in two different worlds.

34:33.571 --> 34:34.781
They're not.

34:35.948 --> 34:38.534
But I'm having a hard time
convincing anyone of that.

34:41.537 --> 34:45.041
And arresting Robert will convince them.

34:46.209 --> 34:47.502
[Robert] Arresting me?

34:47.585 --> 34:49.962
I'm a small fish compared to this shark.

35:02.517 --> 35:03.768
I'm sorry, Robert.

35:10.900 --> 35:11.901
You're my friend.

35:13.444 --> 35:16.155
This, what I'm doing here...

35:17.240 --> 35:19.200
I consider an act of friendship.

35:23.329 --> 35:24.622

[pensive music playing]

35:58.781 --> 35:59.866
So is it true?

36:00.950 --> 36:02.785
That you took him off Reddington's jet?

36:04.162 --> 36:07.081
If we offer him a deal,
he'll identify SPK members

36:07.165 --> 36:09.292
and those who bought the stolen relics.

36:09.959 --> 36:11.252
But is it true?

36:11.335 --> 36:14.505

Did Cooper find you?

37:04.555 --> 37:05.640
What does he want?

37:05.723 --> 37:08.684
Your drug test came back.
A diluted negative.

37:09.518 --> 37:10.978
What does that mean?

37:11.062 --> 37:12.980
We both know the answer to that.

37:14.357 --> 37:16.484
-Did I pass or not?
-Neither.

37:16.567 --> 37:17.902
You have to retake it.

37:17.985 --> 37:19.779
Under even closer supervision.

37:19.862 --> 37:21.739
Which means you can't use this.

-You don't know what you're talking about.
-Unfortunately for you,

37:28.329 --> 37:30.081
I know exactly what I'm talking about.

37:30.164 --> 37:32.833
I'm a child of an addict.
I know the tricks of the trade.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.835
How eye drops can throw off
a urine sample.

37:34.919 --> 37:38.297
How sucking down water
can render the results meaningless.

37:38.381 --> 37:39.465
Did you tell Cooper?

37:39.548 --> 37:40.758
I didn't.

37:40.841 --> 37:42.635
Because I think you need this job.

37:42.718 --> 37:45.388
You're good at it and it keeps you
on the straight and narrow.

37:46.472 --> 37:48.641
I want you to have your badge back.

37:48.724 --> 37:50.935

38:05.825 --> 38:08.744
Aram. I thought you'd be out celebrating.

38:08.828 --> 38:13.165
I saw my parents
and my business partner, Nick.

38:13.249 --> 38:15.751
They must be so happy and proud of you.

38:15.835 --> 38:17.211
We did good work today.

38:17.753 --> 38:18.629
At the church.

38:20.256 --> 38:21.424
We saved a lot of people.

38:21.507 --> 38:23.592
Yes. It was a good day.

38:24.176 --> 38:25.511
We got a lot of those.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.556
Days where we help people.

38:29.432 --> 38:30.558
Why are you here?

38:30.641 --> 38:33.728
It's late. Everyone's gone home.

38:33.811 --> 38:36.522
Your ship has come in
and yet here you are.

38:38.024 --> 38:40.234
I had my business partner buy me out.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.528
And, um... It wasn't much.

38:43.237 --> 38:45.906
Enough for a new kitchen.
Mom's been wanting one.

38:45.990 --> 38:49.076
And I made Nick create
a camp scholarship in my name.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.203
Space Camp. I was 12.

38:51.287 --> 38:53.956
It, um... It changed my life.

38:55.666 --> 38:57.251
There won't always be good days.

38:57.835 --> 38:58.669
I know.

38:59.962 --> 39:04.675
And, uh, on those, I may regret my choice.

39:04.759 --> 39:05.593
But...

39:07.595 --> 39:08.471
not much.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.265
And on the good days, I, um--

39:15.061 --> 39:17.480
I can't think of anywhere else
I'd rather be.

39:18.064 --> 39:20.066
Sounds like a reason to celebrate.

39:20.149 --> 39:22.151
Come on. I'll buy you a drink.

39:22.234 --> 39:25.363
Thanks, but if it's okay,
I'd like to just hang out here.

Of course.

39:42.671 --> 39:43.631
I'm speechless.

39:43.714 --> 39:48.260
If you weren't, you would be if I told you
what the damn thing cost me.

39:49.428 --> 39:51.138
Aren't you awestruck?

39:51.931 --> 39:55.059
I appreciate
the object's place in history,

39:55.142 --> 39:57.186
but not the reverence for it.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.688
In that, I agree with Giovanni.

39:59.772 --> 40:03.943
Getting lost in the past
distracts us from the work of the present.

40:04.693 --> 40:08.364
I still have a hard time believing
you didn't know Vesco was Giovanni.

40:08.447 --> 40:09.615
Lucky coincidence.

40:09.698 --> 40:14.787
Or unlucky, seeing as he's going to prison
and taking a fortune of mine with him.

40:15.538 --> 40:16.622
He had a long run.

40:17.248 --> 40:20.459
I doubt we've heard
the last of Robert Vesco.

40:21.043 --> 40:21.961
Who knows?

40:22.545 --> 40:24.964
If I get bored, maybe I'll break him out.

40:25.047 --> 40:27.883
I'd love to best him one last time.

40:27.967 --> 40:31.554
And you wonder why Charlene
insists on supervised visitation.

40:31.637 --> 40:32.847
[chuckles]

40:33.347 --> 40:36.684
Have you decided on whether
you can abide by our visitation terms?

40:39.019 --> 40:40.604
As a matter of survival,

40:40.688 --> 40:45.818
I make it a point to only enter spaces
whose borders I define.

40:47.945 --> 40:50.448
But if spending time with Agnes

40:51.031 --> 40:55.327
requires submitting to borders
defined by you and Charlene, so be it.

40:55.411 --> 40:58.080
I don't like it,
but the alternative is far worse.

40:58.164 --> 40:59.582
Agreed. I'll go get her.

41:00.541 --> 41:01.584
Now?

41:02.168 --> 41:03.544
Go get Agnes right now?

41:03.627 --> 41:04.712
Why not?

41:04.795 --> 41:06.255
You've waited two years.

41:06.338 --> 41:08.924
No point in keeping you
waiting any longer.

41:21.937 --> 41:23.314
You look fine.

41:24.607 --> 41:26.525
[Cooper] You met him a long time ago.

41:26.609 --> 41:30.821
He was a close friend of your mother's
and he's very excited to see you.

41:35.993 --> 41:37.077
Hi.

41:39.038 --> 41:39.872
Hi.

41:41.582 --> 41:43.417
You probably don't remember me.

41:44.585 --> 41:45.794
I remember you.

41:46.378 --> 41:49.256
We sailed boats together in Central Park.

41:49.965 --> 41:51.300
And we got fruit pops.

41:51.383 --> 41:52.301
Yes.

41:53.260 --> 41:54.345
That's right.

41:55.513 --> 41:59.141
That was the day
before the day my mother died.

42:06.398 --> 42:07.483
You're Pinky.

42:10.986 --> 42:11.820
Yes.

42:14.114 --> 42:15.115
I'm Pinky.
