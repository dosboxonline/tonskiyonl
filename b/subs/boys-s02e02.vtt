HOSTESS:
Hi.

01:46.524 --> 01:48.526
Welcome to Endless Pasta Week
at Tony Cicero's.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.070
Where the fuck am I?

01:51.111 --> 01:52.488
You're at Tony Cicero's.

01:52.530 --> 01:54.657
No, no.
What fucking city am I in?

01:54.698 --> 01:56.283
Uh, Fort Wayne.

01:56.325 --> 01:57.993
The fuck?

01:58.035 --> 02:00.746
You got a bit of paper,
something I can write with?

02:00.788 --> 02:02.039
A pen, anything.

02:02.081 --> 02:03.874
(muttering):
Ah, fuck it.

02:03.916 --> 02:06.168
(indistinct chatter)

02:06.210 --> 02:08.963
NEWS ANCHOR:
Yesterday, it closed

02:09.004 --> 02:11.173
at ten percent below
its record high,

02:11.215 --> 02:13.551
set last month.

02:13.592 --> 02:16.178
Federal authorities have
initiated a multistate manhunt

02:16.220 --> 02:19.682
for William Butcher
for allegedly murdering

02:19.723 --> 02:22.184
Vought Vice President
Madelyn Stillwell

02:22.226 --> 02:25.437
as well as endangering
her infant son, Theodore.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.107
Law enforcement officials
have set up a tip line

02:28.148 --> 02:30.693
and are urging anyone
with information

02:30.734 --> 02:34.154
regarding the suspect's
whereabouts to come forward.

02:34.196 --> 02:37.157
Police are also asking...

02:44.164 --> 02:46.083
(sniffles)

02:46.166 --> 02:48.168
("IndÃ©-Structible" by Guizmo
playing)

02:57.595 --> 03:01.015
"Boy, girl."

03:07.271 --> 03:09.231
I am sorry.

03:09.273 --> 03:11.066
I do not understand.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.659
All right, I'm off.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.912
-HUGHIE: Where you going?
-Going to meet a contact.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.622
Who?

03:24.663 --> 03:27.416
Someone who can help us find
this Supe terrorist cunt.

03:27.458 --> 03:28.626
Who is the contact?

03:28.667 --> 03:30.669
What is their actual name?

03:32.838 --> 03:34.757
-You'll love it.
-No, I won't.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.717
I won't love it.
I never love it.

03:36.759 --> 03:38.093
I never fucking love it!

03:40.512 --> 03:41.639
Noted.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.182
Not a word from him.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.851
He left us for dead, and now
it's like nothing happened?

03:52.191 --> 03:54.151
You're right.

03:54.193 --> 03:56.153
I am sorry.

03:56.195 --> 03:59.073
Sorry that I trusted this lot
was smart enough

03:59.114 --> 04:01.992
to save themselves like they've
done a hundred times before.

04:02.034 --> 04:03.369
Okay, well, where you been?

04:03.410 --> 04:05.788
Well, technically,
I called him back.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.957
He blew up Madelyn Stillwell.

04:07.998 --> 04:11.585
I told you. She was already dead
when I blew her up.

04:11.627 --> 04:13.963
Oh. Great. Cool.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.632
Totally. We're just gonna
pretend like this is normal?

04:16.674 --> 04:18.258
Like we're fucking lemmings?

04:28.936 --> 04:31.480
Well, who else
they gonna follow?

04:38.570 --> 04:40.572
Right.

04:47.746 --> 04:50.624
(birds chirping)

04:50.666 --> 04:52.501
(grunts)

04:52.543 --> 04:55.462
(laughs softly)

04:55.504 --> 04:58.090
Hey. You know, my dad,

04:58.132 --> 05:01.051
he had a ball
from the '56 World Series.

05:01.093 --> 05:02.970
Signed by Don Larsen himself.

05:03.012 --> 05:04.972
Pitched a no-hitter in Game 5.

05:05.014 --> 05:06.598
Really?

05:06.640 --> 05:09.268
Pretty cool, huh?

05:09.309 --> 05:12.438
Ooh. That's okay. Uh...

05:12.479 --> 05:14.648
You'll, uh,
you'll get the next one.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.525
-Yeah.
-Yeah!

05:16.567 --> 05:18.152
RYAN:
Yeah, I'll get the next one.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.905
(sighs)

05:21.947 --> 05:23.741
Okay.

05:23.782 --> 05:27.036
Ryan. Use your powers.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.328
What do you mean?

05:33.375 --> 05:35.502
RYAN:
Huh.

05:35.544 --> 05:36.795
I can't do that.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.923
Yes, you can. You're my son.

05:41.633 --> 05:46.472
Has anyone told you
what you're capable of?

05:48.307 --> 05:49.516
No.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.396
Well, then it's about time
you found out.

05:54.438 --> 05:57.274
BECCA:
Hey, Ryan? Come on.
Math time, buddy.

05:57.316 --> 05:58.901
Chapters 12 and 13
in your workbook.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.486
(exhales)
Yeah.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.571
Math, yeah. Sorry, I forgot.

06:02.613 --> 06:04.573
BECCA:
It's your favorite.

06:04.615 --> 06:06.325
Be in in a minute, okay?

06:06.366 --> 06:07.993
HOMELANDER:
You know, when I was his age,

06:08.035 --> 06:11.080
I was breaking
the sound barrier.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.290
He can't even throw a fastball.

06:13.332 --> 06:14.958
We thought it was best
that he have

06:15.000 --> 06:17.503
as ordinary
of a childhood as possible.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.505
We?

06:19.546 --> 06:21.381
-Who's we?
-Look,

06:21.423 --> 06:24.093
I just want my kid to be normal.

06:25.636 --> 06:28.430
Well, then,
it's a good thing I'm here.

06:28.472 --> 06:30.599
'Cause my son
is the furthest fucking thing

06:30.641 --> 06:33.602
on this planet
to a normal little boy.

06:33.644 --> 06:36.438
How long are you planning
on staying?

06:37.481 --> 06:40.609
Becca, we had a deal.

06:40.651 --> 06:42.986
A deal that is alive and well

06:43.028 --> 06:46.573
and-and running around
as free as a goddam bird.

06:46.615 --> 06:50.035
So, let's just

06:50.077 --> 06:51.829
try and be civil, shall we?

07:10.722 --> 07:12.724
Did I get 'em right?

07:14.560 --> 07:16.603
There's...

07:16.645 --> 07:19.773
There's no correct
or incorrect answer.

07:19.815 --> 07:21.525
Oh.

07:23.569 --> 07:25.821
What is missing here?

07:28.031 --> 07:31.076
DEEP:
Uh...

07:33.078 --> 07:37.207
Deep, how do you expect to be
welcomed back into The Seven

07:37.249 --> 07:39.293
if you can't be honest
with yourself?

07:39.334 --> 07:42.379
Carol, if I'm being honest,

07:42.421 --> 07:44.339
I don't know
what the fuck you want from me.

07:44.381 --> 07:45.465
(door closes)

07:46.592 --> 07:48.552
Hey, guys.

07:48.594 --> 07:49.845
How's it going?

07:49.887 --> 07:51.889
Can I have a word?

07:53.849 --> 07:55.809
I don't mean to be negative,

07:55.851 --> 08:00.022
but his operating perspective
is functionally nonexistent.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.232
(whispering): I don't think
there's a path here.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.443
Leave it to me.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.861
(tea kettle whistling)

08:05.903 --> 08:07.821
EAGLE:
See, you're just inhibited

08:07.863 --> 08:10.240
by suppressive energy,
that's it.

08:10.282 --> 08:12.492
Just got to realign things.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.494
What is it? Shrooms?

08:14.536 --> 08:17.372
Last time I did shrooms was
at a Goo Goo Dolls concert

08:17.414 --> 08:20.209
with some poli sci chick
from Oberlin.

08:21.877 --> 08:24.713
I guess I'd call it more
of a gateway.

08:29.468 --> 08:32.054
(coughs sharply, chuckles)

08:33.680 --> 08:35.766
Wait.
Are you not gonna drink any?

08:35.807 --> 08:39.603
No. Deep, this is your journey.

08:44.816 --> 08:47.903
STARLIGHT:
Who's revving up the girl power
in The Seven?

08:47.945 --> 08:49.947
Keep watching, WDCS,

08:49.988 --> 08:53.158
Cleveland's first
and best source for local news.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.993
MAN:
Quiet, please.
Going again. On the bell.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.578
-(bell rings)
-MAN 2: Rolling.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.372
Where should I start?
Are you ready

08:58.413 --> 09:00.123
to meet the newest member
of The Seven?

09:00.165 --> 09:02.125
See it here first, WFAK.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.794
KMFT. WDCS.

09:03.835 --> 09:05.462
-WOMAN: Cut!
-(bell rings)
-Quiet please. Still rolling.

09:05.504 --> 09:07.130
She's the newest member
of The Seven,

09:07.172 --> 09:09.007
and she's taking America
by storm.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.509
From Portland to Seattle.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.552
Watch what comes next, KMFT.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.888
ASHLEY:
Amazing.

09:14.930 --> 09:16.390
Do you need to take a break,

09:16.431 --> 09:17.891
or can we power
through the rest?

09:17.933 --> 09:19.643
Let's just power through.

09:19.685 --> 09:21.812
-(camera shutters clicking)
-(cheering, indistinct chatter)

09:21.853 --> 09:25.107
WOMAN:
Hey, over here!
Give us a shot! Gorgeous!

09:25.148 --> 09:27.484
-(camera shutters clicking)
-Starlight! Oh!

09:27.526 --> 09:30.570
-Stormfront, over here!
-Stormfront, show us
what you got!

09:30.612 --> 09:32.823
-We're ready!
-(reporters oohing)

09:32.864 --> 09:35.075
-(whooping and cheering)
-(laughs)

09:35.117 --> 09:36.910
ASHLEY:
Okay, ladies,

09:36.952 --> 09:39.371
we have a big day--
domestic outlets until noon,

09:39.413 --> 09:41.581
ten minutes each,
foreign until 2:00.

09:41.623 --> 09:44.376
Round tables until 4:00,
print one-on-ones until 6:00.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.169
Jesus,
if she vibrates any faster,

09:46.211 --> 09:48.380
-that stick up her ass
is gonna explode.
-(laughs)

09:48.422 --> 09:50.132
-(phone buzzing)
-We really should
be powering through.

09:50.173 --> 09:51.758
We don't have time.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.969
Hello?

09:57.764 --> 09:59.725
What?

09:59.766 --> 10:01.768
When?

10:04.229 --> 10:06.523
Okay. Thank you.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.358
ASHLEY:
We're going positive,
we're going female,

10:08.400 --> 10:09.943
thoughtful but upbeat.

10:09.985 --> 10:11.862
-Where... What?
-MAEVE: I gotta go.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.698
-What? No.
-I'm sorry. Family emergency.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.116
-Is everything okay?
-Maeve,

10:16.158 --> 10:18.118
we've never had three women
in The Seven before.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.871
This is a moment. Girls get it
done. You are not...!

10:23.248 --> 10:25.292
I have a family emergency, too.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.129
PASTOR:
A reading
from the Book of Revelations.

10:29.171 --> 10:32.007
"And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes,

10:32.049 --> 10:33.633
and there will be
no more death."

10:33.675 --> 10:36.011
Today, we say goodbye
to Susan Raynor.

10:36.053 --> 10:40.432
For though her body rests, her
soul lives on for all eternity.

10:40.474 --> 10:42.601
And one day,
you will think of Susan

10:42.642 --> 10:45.103
with joy as well as sadness.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.106
They are two sides of a coin
you will carry forever.

10:48.148 --> 10:52.611
And you are blessed
to have your family

10:52.652 --> 10:54.821
and your friends
to help you carry it.

10:54.863 --> 10:57.157
In the name of Christ. Amen.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.161
(two beeps)

11:04.498 --> 11:06.291
(sighs)

11:06.333 --> 11:08.919
You think you can surprise me?

11:08.960 --> 11:12.089
I literally taught you this one.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.511
Hello, Grace.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.513
You promised
I'd never see you again.

11:19.554 --> 11:22.224
I promised...

11:22.265 --> 11:24.518
not to come to your house again.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.940
A subtle
but important distinction.

11:29.981 --> 11:32.067
I assume
you sent the edible arrangement?

11:32.109 --> 11:33.527
Deluxe Bereavement Bouquet

11:33.568 --> 11:35.779
with white chocolate-dipped
pineapple doves.

11:35.821 --> 11:38.115
Raynor would have loved that.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.620
Oi, where you going?

11:43.662 --> 11:45.539
There are about
two dozen federal officers

11:45.580 --> 11:47.374
in the church next door.

11:47.416 --> 11:50.127
I'm gonna turn you in for the
murder of Madelyn Stillwell.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.754
Oh, come off it, Grace.
You really think I done that?

11:52.796 --> 11:54.589
You really want me
to answer that?

11:54.631 --> 11:57.467
Grace, I know who killed Raynor!

12:01.721 --> 12:03.682
Who?

12:03.723 --> 12:06.017
Okay, well, uh,
I don't specifically,

12:06.059 --> 12:09.563
technically have the answer to
that, but I know how to get it.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.359
We think Vought killed her for
getting too close to something.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.652
Getting too close to what?

12:15.694 --> 12:17.070
Something to do
with a Supe terrorist

12:17.112 --> 12:18.697
smuggled into Jersey
a couple of nights ago,

12:18.738 --> 12:20.991
-and that is where we start.
-(laughing): Honestly,

12:21.032 --> 12:23.702
it's like asking a cockroach
to not be a cockroach.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.287
It's just your nature.

12:25.328 --> 12:27.038
I know what she meant to you,
all right?

12:27.080 --> 12:29.124
We find this terrorist,
and we're one step closer

12:29.166 --> 12:30.584
to finding out who offed her.

12:30.625 --> 12:31.960
I'm not getting back in.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.378
And if I were, which I'm not,

12:33.420 --> 12:35.005
it sure as shit wouldn't be
for you.

12:35.046 --> 12:37.591
Oh, I ain't asking you
all the way back in.

12:37.632 --> 12:39.634
Just dip in a little toe, yeah?

12:39.676 --> 12:42.762
Maybe two.
Not for me. For Raynor.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.598
You never gave a shit
about Susan.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.141
You're only here
because you're desperate,

12:46.183 --> 12:47.934
fucked, and you want something.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.896
All right, fuck it.
Grace? Grace!

12:50.937 --> 12:54.191
Grace, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

12:54.232 --> 12:56.151
I'll level with you, okay?

12:56.193 --> 12:58.862
(exhales)
Just hear me out.

12:58.904 --> 13:00.906
(panting)

13:03.074 --> 13:06.828
(singing along): âª I just want
you to know who I am âª

13:06.870 --> 13:09.247
-âª I just want... âª
-MALE VOICE (muffled): Hey.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.833
âª To know who I am âª

13:11.875 --> 13:16.004
âª I just want you
to know who I am âª

13:16.046 --> 13:18.381
-Hey.
-âª I just want you... âª

13:18.423 --> 13:20.300
(music stops)

13:20.342 --> 13:22.010
Eagle?

13:23.053 --> 13:24.804
-Hey!
-(gasps)

13:24.846 --> 13:28.266
In here. Open up.

13:29.851 --> 13:32.229
(breathing heavily)

13:41.029 --> 13:43.532
Bro, we got to talk.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.203
-No, you got to look at us.
-(quietly): No.

13:48.245 --> 13:50.997
Look at us!

13:51.039 --> 13:53.416
(breathing deeply)

13:57.128 --> 13:58.463
(quietly):
Okay.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.007
Remember Melissa Dabrowski,

14:01.049 --> 14:03.635
the kindergarten teacher
you fingerbanged backstage

14:03.677 --> 14:05.929
at the VH1 Educator Awards?

14:05.971 --> 14:07.264
So what?

14:07.305 --> 14:09.641
You were supposed to present her
with Teacher of the Year,

14:09.683 --> 14:12.978
but you bailed while she was
pulling her panties back on.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.188
Yeah, because she laughed at me.

14:15.230 --> 14:16.523
Okay, bullshit.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.066
She just put her hands
on your chest.

14:18.108 --> 14:19.776
You never even unzipped
your suit.

14:19.818 --> 14:20.902
She would have laughed.

14:20.944 --> 14:22.737
Because that's what you do.

14:22.779 --> 14:26.074
You imagine women will laugh at
us, so you humiliate them first.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.784
No, that's-that's not true.

14:27.826 --> 14:31.288
You can't accept your own body,
so you violate theirs.

14:31.329 --> 14:33.790
(stammers)
Shut the fuck up.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.625
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.628
(panting)
Hey. Hey. Hey.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.880
(chuckles)

14:40.922 --> 14:42.591
-You can't swim from us forever!
-Let me out!

14:42.632 --> 14:45.093
You shut the fuck up,
you ugly pieces of shit.

14:45.135 --> 14:47.095
I have nothing else
to say to you.

14:47.137 --> 14:49.306
-We won't let you shut us up
anymore, Kevin!
-(whimpering)

14:49.347 --> 14:51.725
Hey. Hey! Hey!

14:51.766 --> 14:53.977
Let me out, man.
Just let me out!

14:54.019 --> 14:57.314
-Eagle!
-(door rattling)

14:57.355 --> 14:58.690
-Let me out, man!
-(slams against door)

14:58.732 --> 15:00.317
Ride it, brother.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.360
(siren wails in distance)

15:19.794 --> 15:21.796
(sighs)

15:24.549 --> 15:26.551
What are you doing here?

15:28.928 --> 15:31.306
Apparently, your work...

15:31.348 --> 15:34.726
still has "Maggie Shaw"
as your emergency contact.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.687
Ah, shit. Sorry.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.731
That's okay.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.902
Where else would I score
this sweet jelly?

15:43.943 --> 15:45.945
(Elena laughs)

15:47.364 --> 15:49.449
I thought it was bad unagi.

15:49.491 --> 15:52.035
Turns out,
my appendix was about to burst.

15:52.077 --> 15:55.288
Well, there are easier ways
to get my attention.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.876
I kept thinking you'd call.

16:01.419 --> 16:04.214
Yeah. Me, too.

16:04.255 --> 16:07.050
-You want me to call your mom?
-(laughs)

16:07.092 --> 16:10.428
Definitely not.
(groans)

16:10.470 --> 16:14.641
Someone else,
like a girlfriend, or...?

16:14.683 --> 16:16.893
Seriously, thanks for coming,

16:16.935 --> 16:19.020
but I'm sure you have
more important places to be.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.981
Hey, you could die
from something like this.

16:22.023 --> 16:24.651
But I didn't, so I guess
you don't need to save me.

16:24.693 --> 16:27.529
Yeah, well, I still want
to see the doctor.

16:27.570 --> 16:30.573
Maeve, I'm fine, I promise.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.080
(Elena sighs)

16:37.122 --> 16:39.874
You know, watching Botched
doesn't make you

16:39.916 --> 16:42.794
-a fucking medical expert.
-(scoffs)

16:42.836 --> 16:45.630
I'll wait a while
and just see, okay?

16:47.298 --> 16:48.675
Can we get this middle chair out
of here, please?

16:48.717 --> 16:50.093
Yeah. Somebody?
Thank you. Thank you.

16:50.135 --> 16:51.761
Can we get the two on the side
just smushed together?

16:51.803 --> 16:53.805
We lost one of them.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.724
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Okay,
resetting; one background.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.600
-All right, people,
quiet on the set.
-Rolling.

16:57.642 --> 16:59.519
Well, Stormfront,
congrats on The Seven.

16:59.561 --> 17:01.438
Are you as excited to be here
as I am?

17:01.479 --> 17:03.565
I don't know!
I don't think so!

17:03.606 --> 17:05.483
(chuckles)
Can you tell us a little

17:05.525 --> 17:06.901
about how girls get it done?

17:06.943 --> 17:07.902
REPORTER 3:
...girls get it done?

17:07.944 --> 17:08.987
REPORTER 4:
...girls get it done?

17:09.028 --> 17:10.155
REPORTER 5:
...girls get it done?

17:10.196 --> 17:11.197
Let's dish boys.

17:11.239 --> 17:12.907
Starlight, single?
Or, uh, spoken for?

17:12.949 --> 17:14.200
Uh, single, single.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.869
Single.
Uh, single.

17:15.910 --> 17:18.163
Definitely single.
(chuckles)

17:18.204 --> 17:20.874
Tell us how fun it is
to have all this girl power.

17:20.915 --> 17:22.876
-(laughs)
-REPORTER 1:
Can you repeat that but say

17:22.917 --> 17:27.130
"strong is the new pretty"
right at the end?

17:27.172 --> 17:28.423
Do girls make better heroes?

17:28.465 --> 17:30.425
Do girls make better heroes
than boys?

17:30.467 --> 17:32.886
Do girls make better heroes?

17:32.927 --> 17:34.262
Look, uh, no offense.

17:34.304 --> 17:36.055
I-I get you have
your talking points,

17:36.097 --> 17:39.350
but why does it matter whether
heroes have a dick or a vag?

17:39.392 --> 17:42.228
(chuckles): I mean, shouldn't we
all just, you know, be competent

17:42.270 --> 17:43.772
at our jobs?

17:43.813 --> 17:45.940
I-I don't think
girls do anything better.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.942
I think chicks and dicks
are in it together.

17:49.486 --> 17:50.487
(phone buzzing)

17:50.528 --> 17:51.571
Oh, that's me.

17:54.324 --> 17:55.533
(scoffs)

17:55.575 --> 17:57.744
(chuckles):
Sorry, Ashy.

17:57.786 --> 18:00.246
Vought won't let me have pockets
in this thing.

18:00.288 --> 18:02.290
You can see every crease
in my ass.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.584
You can practically see
up Starlight's uterus.

18:04.626 --> 18:05.585
You want to talk
about girl power,

18:05.627 --> 18:07.420
let's talk
about getting some pockets.

18:07.462 --> 18:08.421
(laughs)

18:08.463 --> 18:10.423
Starlight,
your teammate, A-Train,

18:10.465 --> 18:12.425
has been out of the public eye.

18:12.467 --> 18:15.011
-Mm-hmm.
-Vought recently revealed

18:15.053 --> 18:17.931
that he was on a top secret
mission in Kandahar.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.265
Are you worried about him?

18:19.307 --> 18:21.017
(clears throat)
Yeah, of course.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.019
I pray for him every night.

18:23.061 --> 18:25.605
(inhales)
America really is lucky

18:25.647 --> 18:28.024
to have such a brave hero
fighting for them.

18:28.066 --> 18:29.859
What if I told you

18:29.901 --> 18:31.402
he's right behind you?

18:31.444 --> 18:33.363
-(sonic boom)
-Here comes

18:33.404 --> 18:35.240
the A-Train!

18:35.281 --> 18:37.367
What's up?

18:37.408 --> 18:39.160
-Wow.
-All right.

18:39.202 --> 18:43.081
-Yeah. (chuckling)
-(forced chuckling)

18:43.122 --> 18:45.208
-Wow, welcome back.
-Thanks.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.709
Thank you. Mmm.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.711
Stormfront, you know,
it is such an honor to meet you.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.129
-Oh.
-I'm a huge fan.

18:50.171 --> 18:51.798
-Feeling's mutual.
-Don't get up. Yeah, relax.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.717
Relax for a second. Um,
maybe get a chair or something.

18:54.759 --> 18:56.636
âª âª

18:56.678 --> 18:58.096
(quietly):
This is crazy.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.475
âª 30 hitters on my side âª

19:02.517 --> 19:05.061
âª Got a little mama in my ride âª

19:05.103 --> 19:07.105
âª Then we'll shoot, then
we'll cry, then we'll swoop âª

19:07.146 --> 19:10.108
âª Then we'll fly, see the truth,
tell no lies... âª

19:10.149 --> 19:12.318
STARLIGHT:
Hey.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.570
How are you feeling?

19:15.071 --> 19:17.031
Fan-fucking-tastic.

19:17.073 --> 19:19.242
-That's great.
-(chuckles)

19:19.284 --> 19:20.827
We were really worried
about you.

19:20.869 --> 19:23.246
(plucking strings)

19:23.288 --> 19:24.789
-Do you play?
-(chuckles softly)

19:24.831 --> 19:26.499
Nope.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.501
This is Prince's guitar
from Purple Rain.

19:28.543 --> 19:30.253
When I woke up,

19:30.295 --> 19:32.255
I was just like,

19:32.297 --> 19:33.756
"Fuck it.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.508
I want that shit."

19:35.550 --> 19:37.385
(chuckles)

19:37.427 --> 19:40.847
Shit like what I went through

19:40.889 --> 19:44.976
really gives you
some perspective.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.436
You know?

19:46.477 --> 19:47.437
Totally.

19:47.478 --> 19:49.230
They told me you came by my room

19:49.272 --> 19:53.109
every day to pray for me.

19:54.319 --> 19:55.445
Thank you.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.363
Mm. You're so welcome.

19:57.405 --> 20:01.784
Yeah, I-I think
that prayer really does help.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.411
Anyway...

20:03.453 --> 20:04.829
Mm-hmm.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.707
You should know
that everyone thinks it was

20:07.749 --> 20:09.876
a really good idea
that you called me in

20:09.918 --> 20:11.377
for backup that night.

20:11.419 --> 20:13.129
I mean, what would've happened

20:13.171 --> 20:15.715
if I hadn't been there
to give you CPR?

20:15.757 --> 20:18.301
-(exhales)
-(chuckles)

20:18.343 --> 20:19.969
-That's good to know.
-Mm.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.596
(chuckles softly)

20:24.015 --> 20:25.558
How does everyone feel
about you helping

20:25.600 --> 20:27.226
your traitor fucking boyfriend
escape?

20:28.603 --> 20:31.898
Or maybe you didn't mention
that part.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.695
(chuckles)

20:37.737 --> 20:39.697
Uh, s-- Mm.

20:39.739 --> 20:44.202
Who did you mention
that part to?

20:44.243 --> 20:46.245
âª âª

20:55.129 --> 20:57.256
("You're Only Human"
by Billy Joel playing)

20:57.298 --> 21:02.887
âª You're having a hard time and
lately you don't feel so good âª

21:02.929 --> 21:04.514
(sighs)

21:04.555 --> 21:06.808
âª You're getting
a bad reputation âª

21:06.849 --> 21:10.269
âª In your neighborhood... âª

21:21.280 --> 21:24.701
Just had a meeting
with the colonel.

21:28.830 --> 21:32.000
Colonel Mallory?

21:32.041 --> 21:34.043
Y-You saw her?

21:34.085 --> 21:36.212
That's right, Frenchie.

21:36.254 --> 21:38.339
She's gonna help us.

21:38.381 --> 21:40.341
We get her the Supe terrorist,

21:40.383 --> 21:43.386
she's gonna get the CIA
to scrub our records clean,

21:43.428 --> 21:46.097
get the Old Bill off our asses,

21:46.139 --> 21:48.433
get you back to your girls.

21:48.474 --> 21:50.893
HUGHIE:
How do we know
you're telling the truth?

21:53.396 --> 21:57.442
734 Central Ave.,

21:57.483 --> 21:59.402
Newark.

21:59.444 --> 22:00.737
What does that mean?

22:00.778 --> 22:02.447
That's the address she gave me.
It's linked

22:02.488 --> 22:03.865
to the blind bank account
that smuggled

22:03.906 --> 22:05.283
that Supe cunt stateside.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.243
And I'll bet you he's there.

22:07.285 --> 22:09.037
Oh, my Lord.

22:09.078 --> 22:12.749
Ain't you twats lucky
that I showed up, eh?

22:27.764 --> 22:30.058
(exhales)

22:30.099 --> 22:32.643
(sighs)

22:32.685 --> 22:35.646
Melissa Dabrowski was more
than just another fingerbang,

22:35.688 --> 22:37.482
-you know?
-No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

22:37.523 --> 22:39.984
It's not fucking happening.
It's not fucking real.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.986
Ah, the way she looked at you.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.988
She was sweet, smart.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.032
Girl like that,
you could've been happy.

22:46.074 --> 22:47.450
(exhales)

22:47.492 --> 22:49.869
You deserve to be loved.

22:49.911 --> 22:52.038
(sighs)

22:52.080 --> 22:53.623
Don't fuck with me.

22:53.664 --> 22:56.250
You deserve to be loved, Kevin.

22:56.292 --> 22:57.877
But that starts with you.

22:57.919 --> 22:58.878
Don't fuck with me.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.671
Take a look.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.007
A real look.

23:04.467 --> 23:05.635
Go on.

23:05.676 --> 23:08.262
(breathing heavily)

23:25.404 --> 23:28.032
I'm sorry.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.826
I'm so sorry.

23:29.867 --> 23:31.119
I'm the ugly one.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.120
No.

23:32.161 --> 23:33.204
Yes.

23:34.247 --> 23:37.500
On the inside.

23:37.542 --> 23:41.379
You just don't see what I see.

23:51.806 --> 23:54.851
âª You are âª

23:54.892 --> 23:58.187
âª So beautiful âª

23:58.229 --> 23:59.689
(cries)

23:59.730 --> 24:02.108
No.

24:02.150 --> 24:03.776
âª To me âª

24:03.818 --> 24:06.445
âª You are âª

24:06.487 --> 24:09.866
âª So beautiful âª

24:09.907 --> 24:11.659
âª To me âª

24:12.869 --> 24:14.453
I'm not.

24:14.495 --> 24:19.292
âª You're everything
I hoped for âª

24:19.333 --> 24:24.714
âª You're everything I need âª

24:24.755 --> 24:27.383
âª You are âª

24:27.425 --> 24:30.803
âª So beautiful âª

24:30.845 --> 24:33.389
-âª To me âª
-âª To me âª

24:33.431 --> 24:36.058
(sniffles, shudders)

24:36.100 --> 24:38.394
âª Can't âª

24:38.436 --> 24:41.022
âª Can't you âª

24:41.063 --> 24:46.611
âª See...? âª

24:46.652 --> 24:49.280
DEEP and GILLS:
âª You're âª

24:49.322 --> 24:52.867
âª Everything I hoped for âª

24:52.909 --> 24:54.243
âª You're âª

24:54.285 --> 24:58.789
âª Everything I need âª

24:58.831 --> 25:01.792
âª You are âª

25:01.834 --> 25:04.795
âª So âª

25:04.837 --> 25:08.466
âª Beautiful âª

25:08.507 --> 25:11.219
âª To me âª

25:11.260 --> 25:12.511
âª Yeah. âª

25:15.765 --> 25:17.016
(sighs)

25:17.058 --> 25:20.353
So, in short, do not waste
your hard-earned cash

25:20.394 --> 25:22.438
on this shitty,
big-titted hunk of plastic

25:22.480 --> 25:24.357
that'll probably end up
in a manatee's belly

25:24.398 --> 25:27.485
when your kid chucks it
in the garbage.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.445
Hey. Um...

25:29.487 --> 25:32.031
I just got to say,

25:32.073 --> 25:35.618
I really like everything that
you've been saying about Vought.

25:35.660 --> 25:36.994
Yeah, okay, cool.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.412
No, I mean...

25:38.454 --> 25:40.164
I agree with you.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.500
You wearing a wire or something?

25:42.541 --> 25:44.043
What? What does that have to...

25:44.085 --> 25:46.671
Look, I mean this
in the nicest possible way,

25:46.712 --> 25:49.048
but I don't need
some fucking Vought Spy Barbie

25:49.090 --> 25:51.092
sniffing around to see
whether I'm a team player.

25:51.133 --> 25:53.552
What? That is

25:53.594 --> 25:56.097
not at all what I am.

25:56.138 --> 25:57.515
I used to be a fan.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.267
But look at you.

25:59.308 --> 26:03.312
You're like the Voughtiest
Vought in all Vought.

26:08.359 --> 26:12.029
I think, uh, cyclops dude's
trying to get your attention.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.699
(quietly):
Fuck.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.617
What happened to your eye?

26:16.659 --> 26:18.786
Oh, Vought is testing
a new volumizing

26:18.828 --> 26:20.788
dry shampoo for eye irritation.

26:20.830 --> 26:22.540
As if you give a fuck.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.750
Here.

26:24.792 --> 26:26.794
I brought you a sample.

26:29.797 --> 26:31.257
Are you kidding me?

26:31.299 --> 26:32.883
I can't take this right now.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.260
I can't get away
from this press junket.

26:34.302 --> 26:36.887
I literally have no pockets.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.222
You wanted the V, here it is.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.849
If you threaten me again,
I'm gonna make sure

26:39.890 --> 26:41.642
that everyone knows
that you're the one who took it.

26:42.685 --> 26:43.686
Uh...

26:47.231 --> 26:49.650
-A-TRAIN: You're tight
with Gecko?
-Hey.

26:49.692 --> 26:52.695
Yeah, it--
From Capes for Christ,

26:52.737 --> 26:54.780
back in the day. Yeah.

26:54.822 --> 26:56.449
Yeah.

26:56.490 --> 26:58.034
What'd you just put
in your boot?

26:58.075 --> 27:00.369
What? Nothing.

27:02.079 --> 27:04.540
'Cause it looked like you
just put something in your boot.

27:04.582 --> 27:08.836
Why don't you tell me
what's in my boot?

27:25.770 --> 27:27.271
(exhales)

27:27.313 --> 27:30.483
Maybe... you shouldn't
be hitting the Cristal

27:30.524 --> 27:33.486
with your buddies quite so soon.

27:33.527 --> 27:34.904
Come on.

27:34.945 --> 27:37.073
Let's finish dick-tickling
these half-wits

27:37.114 --> 27:39.617
so we can finally do
our real job.

27:41.827 --> 27:44.080
Shall we?

27:48.584 --> 27:49.835
BECCA:
All right, kiddo.

27:49.877 --> 27:51.295
Here we are.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.713
Have a great lesson.

27:52.755 --> 27:54.507
Yeah.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.302
Okay, I'll be back in an hour.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.720
I'm gonna go have coffee
with Ms. Bird.

27:59.762 --> 28:02.932
Yeah. Um, thanks.

28:02.973 --> 28:04.475
Bye!

28:04.517 --> 28:07.228
MRS. CROWDER:
Hi, Ryan, how are you?

28:13.359 --> 28:16.320
(engine revving)

28:16.362 --> 28:18.447
âª âª

28:20.157 --> 28:21.409
(inhales deeply)

28:21.450 --> 28:22.451
(exhales)

28:23.536 --> 28:24.745
(gulps)

28:26.789 --> 28:29.583
(inhales)

28:41.804 --> 28:43.305
âª âª

29:01.740 --> 29:03.033
(seat belt clicks)

29:04.076 --> 29:05.453
Open the door.

29:05.494 --> 29:07.538
Open the fucking door!

29:07.580 --> 29:08.789
Please get back inside the car.

29:08.831 --> 29:10.624
I want to talk to Dr. Park.

29:10.666 --> 29:11.709
Go back inside the car.

29:11.750 --> 29:12.877
Goddamn it, Dr. Park!

29:12.918 --> 29:13.961
Now!

29:14.003 --> 29:15.212
(phone rings)

29:18.966 --> 29:21.844
-PARK: Hey, Becca.
-What the fuck is going on?

29:21.886 --> 29:23.512
I understand this is upsetting.

29:23.554 --> 29:26.015
I was told I would never have
to see him ever again,

29:26.056 --> 29:27.892
that he would never know
about Ryan or me.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.351
That was the deal.

29:29.393 --> 29:31.061
Homelander is quite upset
that this information

29:31.103 --> 29:32.188
was concealed from him.

29:32.229 --> 29:33.439
Corporate has made a decision

29:33.481 --> 29:34.982
not to antagonize him further.

29:35.024 --> 29:36.317
(shuddering)

29:36.358 --> 29:38.319
You need to make him leave.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.237
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna take Ryan

29:40.279 --> 29:41.655
and I'm gonna run,

29:41.697 --> 29:44.033
and you'll never fucking find us
ever again.

29:44.074 --> 29:47.119
I think we both know
that that's not possible.

29:49.413 --> 29:52.041
You have to protect us.

29:52.082 --> 29:53.375
You have...

29:53.417 --> 29:55.294
You have to move us, please.

29:55.336 --> 29:57.213
I'm sorry.
Now that he knows,

29:57.254 --> 29:59.757
there's just no putting the
toothpaste back in the tube.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.050
You should probably
be getting back.

30:01.091 --> 30:02.718
Piano lessons are almost done.

30:02.760 --> 30:04.386
Just keep him calm.

30:04.428 --> 30:05.721
Our best guess--

30:05.763 --> 30:07.348
he'll get bored and move on.

30:07.389 --> 30:10.768
You-you don't know that.

30:10.809 --> 30:13.229
You don't.

30:21.529 --> 30:23.322
Do I get to keep this?

30:23.364 --> 30:24.657
MAEVE:
Maybe.

30:24.698 --> 30:26.700
What will you trade me for it?

30:28.035 --> 30:30.746
I will let you
take me out to dinner.

30:34.625 --> 30:35.834
Right.

30:35.876 --> 30:38.295
I forgot.
We'll need to order in,

30:38.337 --> 30:40.798
keep it low-pro.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.801
Maeve, what are you doing here
if nothing has changed?

30:44.843 --> 30:46.971
(laughs):
Oh, Christ.

30:47.012 --> 30:50.641
The last thing that woman needs
is another nose job.

30:50.683 --> 30:53.102
Okay. We've done
this dance, thanks.

30:54.436 --> 30:56.438
-Elena...
-It's time to go.

30:57.690 --> 30:59.692
(takes deep breath)

31:12.955 --> 31:16.250
Homelander and I went
to this Oscar party

31:16.292 --> 31:18.294
for 12 Years a Slave.

31:18.335 --> 31:21.213
There was this producer,
he swapped place cards

31:21.255 --> 31:23.007
so he could sit next to me.

31:23.048 --> 31:24.925
And he chatted me up all night.

31:24.967 --> 31:28.137
Two days later,
there's a fire in his office.

31:28.178 --> 31:31.599
They found his head
in one room...

31:31.640 --> 31:34.351
and his torso in another.

31:35.352 --> 31:37.521
What are you saying?

31:38.897 --> 31:41.692
I don't want him
to do that to you.

31:41.734 --> 31:44.028
Who?

31:48.490 --> 31:50.159
Homelander?

31:51.744 --> 31:54.163
You think Homelander did that?

31:54.204 --> 31:55.789
The things...

31:55.831 --> 31:57.833
that I've watched him do...

32:01.420 --> 32:04.173
...the things
that he made me do...

32:09.219 --> 32:12.014
If he ever finds out
about you...

32:12.056 --> 32:14.516
(takes deep breath)

32:15.559 --> 32:18.062
Why are you telling me this now?

32:25.235 --> 32:27.863
I don't want you
to hate me anymore.

32:29.823 --> 32:31.533
Cool.

32:31.575 --> 32:33.702
-Thank you.
-(chuckles)

32:33.744 --> 32:35.287
You're welcome.

32:35.329 --> 32:38.248
It's crazy you don't have one
already, actually.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.876
I don't really have anyone
to call, though.

32:40.918 --> 32:42.211
(sighs)

32:42.252 --> 32:43.587
You could call me.

32:46.006 --> 32:48.133
You know, Ryan, um,

32:48.175 --> 32:51.970
when I was your age, I didn't
have many friends either.

32:52.012 --> 32:55.557
Mom says being lonely
makes you know yourself better.

32:55.599 --> 32:56.892
Well...

32:56.934 --> 32:59.395
that's not wrong, I suppose.

33:02.022 --> 33:03.982
Can I tell you a secret?

33:04.024 --> 33:06.527
Man-to-man, you know?

33:10.239 --> 33:11.740
(sighs)

33:13.909 --> 33:15.452
(chuckles)

33:16.912 --> 33:19.331
My dad and I...

33:19.373 --> 33:23.252
we never played catch in the
yard with a World Series ball.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.463
Truth is...

33:26.505 --> 33:28.924
I never had a dad.

33:30.217 --> 33:31.760
Or a mom.

33:32.803 --> 33:35.472
Wait, you... you didn't?

33:38.058 --> 33:42.187
See, sometimes it's hard, Ryan,

33:42.229 --> 33:44.523
being...
(sighs)

33:44.565 --> 33:47.109
superior to every single
other person on the planet.

33:47.151 --> 33:49.319
It's-it's... isolating.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.488
And gods...

33:51.530 --> 33:55.909
should not have to feel
that kind of...

33:55.951 --> 33:57.828
yeah, pain.

33:58.996 --> 34:00.372
Because that...

34:00.414 --> 34:03.751
is what we are, Ryan.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.213
You and me.

34:11.175 --> 34:13.135
We're gods.

34:16.221 --> 34:21.393
Son, we can do anything we want.

34:21.435 --> 34:24.229
And no one can stop us.

34:24.271 --> 34:27.399
Now, that..

34:27.441 --> 34:30.027
that's a good feeling.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.279
A really good feeling.

34:33.489 --> 34:36.825
And now you...

34:36.867 --> 34:39.161
and me...

34:39.203 --> 34:41.997
can share it together.

34:45.501 --> 34:46.960
I...

34:47.002 --> 34:49.588
I-I should probably go
to bed now, you know?

34:49.630 --> 34:51.590
Sure.

34:51.632 --> 34:53.342
(pats Ryan)

35:03.435 --> 35:05.437
I love you, son.

35:07.898 --> 35:09.983
You know, you can say it back.

35:10.025 --> 35:12.069
Um, I...

35:12.110 --> 35:13.695
love you, too.

35:13.737 --> 35:15.489
(sighs)

35:15.531 --> 35:17.407
This is nice.

35:28.418 --> 35:30.420
-Your turn, Mom.
-You need to leave.

35:32.089 --> 35:33.465
Excuse me?

35:33.507 --> 35:36.134
You need to get the fuck
out of my house.

35:42.599 --> 35:44.560
What happens one day

35:44.601 --> 35:49.231
when Ryan asks to go
to a baseball game,

35:49.273 --> 35:52.568
swim in the ocean,
or eat at a Burger King?

35:54.570 --> 35:56.655
How do you think he's gonna feel
when he finds out

35:56.697 --> 35:59.658
that you've lied to him
his whole life?

36:02.202 --> 36:04.329
You think he's gonna be happy

36:04.371 --> 36:08.125
that you kept him
in this pretty prison?

36:10.544 --> 36:12.421
Or...

36:12.462 --> 36:15.382
do you think
he'll fucking despise you?

36:16.717 --> 36:18.093
Hmm?

36:19.094 --> 36:21.138
Let's go ask him.

36:22.347 --> 36:23.724
Don't.

36:27.769 --> 36:30.272
You were right.

36:30.314 --> 36:33.942
I'm not gonna get bored
and move on.

36:33.984 --> 36:36.194
I'm not going anywhere.

36:36.236 --> 36:39.531
So feel free to tell Dr. Park
to go fuck himself.

36:45.662 --> 36:47.956
How about some Jiffy Pop?

36:49.333 --> 36:51.335
(departing footsteps)

36:54.963 --> 36:56.506
Halothane shot.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.759
I only got two of these.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.053
BUTCHER:
Well, we better make it count.

37:01.094 --> 37:03.680
FRENCHIE:
What if it doesn't work
on the terrorist inside?

37:03.722 --> 37:05.515
Then we're
right and well fucked.

37:22.783 --> 37:24.159
Are you okay?

37:42.094 --> 37:44.137
âª âª

38:04.950 --> 38:06.952
âª âª

38:27.180 --> 38:28.849
(grunts)

38:45.824 --> 38:48.035
Shining Light Liberation Army?

38:50.245 --> 38:52.873
The ones who kidnapped you.

38:52.914 --> 38:54.791
You know this man?

38:57.836 --> 38:59.671
What is going on?

39:01.381 --> 39:03.258
Kimiko.

39:30.410 --> 39:32.579
(breath trembling)

39:32.621 --> 39:34.039
(sniffles)

39:47.511 --> 39:48.804
(exhales)

39:51.556 --> 39:55.602
Mouse.

39:55.644 --> 39:59.356
I thought
I'd never see you again.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.607
FRENCHIE:
Boy...

40:00.649 --> 40:02.567
and girl.

40:02.609 --> 40:04.402
Her brother.

40:04.444 --> 40:07.572
That's what she
was trying to tell me.

40:11.451 --> 40:12.786
(panting)

40:14.412 --> 40:16.957
(whispers): Butcher,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

40:16.998 --> 40:18.291
It's her brother.

40:24.005 --> 40:25.841
âª âª

40:50.490 --> 40:52.784
âª âª

40:55.328 --> 40:56.746
Kimiko!

41:00.250 --> 41:01.835
Wait!

41:13.346 --> 41:14.472
Hey.

41:15.515 --> 41:17.392
You don't know me.

41:17.434 --> 41:19.102
I'm not a sellout.

41:19.144 --> 41:20.854
Oh, okay, cool.

41:20.896 --> 41:22.898
Congratulations.
(chuckles)

41:24.316 --> 41:27.277
Oh, come on,
why do you care what I think?

41:28.528 --> 41:30.197
Maybe...

41:30.238 --> 41:33.491
I want to say everything
that you're saying about Vought.

41:33.533 --> 41:35.911
Maybe I think Vought's...

41:40.790 --> 41:42.500
What? What's Vought?

41:45.337 --> 41:48.506
Oh, my God, everyone is
so fucking stage-managed.

41:48.548 --> 41:51.009
Life isn't actually
a PR strategy.

41:51.051 --> 41:52.594
You can say what you think.

41:52.636 --> 41:54.054
What if it's not safe?

41:54.095 --> 41:55.972
You are literally bulletproof.

41:56.014 --> 41:58.058
What the fuck is gonna happen?

41:59.643 --> 42:01.019
Okay.

42:01.061 --> 42:03.813
Who's the greatest superhero
of all time?

42:03.855 --> 42:05.857
Hmm, Homelander?

42:05.899 --> 42:08.276
No. Pippi Longstocking.

42:09.611 --> 42:11.571
Pippi Longstocking.
She's a nine-year-old girl.

42:11.613 --> 42:13.198
Lived in a house all by herself.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.408
Pet monkey. Could lift
a horse with one hand.

42:15.450 --> 42:17.410
You-you haven't read
Pippi Longstocking?

42:17.452 --> 42:19.037
I guess not.

42:19.079 --> 42:20.622
Hmm.

42:20.664 --> 42:24.417
Okay, well, uh, I used to dress
as her every Halloween,

42:24.459 --> 42:26.586
and all the girls dressed
like Disney sluts

42:26.628 --> 42:28.505
would make fun of me,
and you know what I thought?

42:28.546 --> 42:31.049
I thought, "Who fucking cares?"

42:31.091 --> 42:32.133
Pippi didn't care.

42:32.175 --> 42:34.386
She never cared
about being polite.

42:34.427 --> 42:36.346
Or cute.

42:36.388 --> 42:38.098
Look.

42:38.139 --> 42:42.769
Fuck this world
for confusing nice with good.

42:42.811 --> 42:44.646
Be a bitch if you want.
Be whatever.

42:44.688 --> 42:47.649
Just drop the mask
once in a while.

42:47.691 --> 42:48.942
Feels good.

42:48.984 --> 42:51.111
You can finally breathe.

42:54.990 --> 42:57.742
Oh, and if someone sticks
a dick in your mouth,

42:57.784 --> 42:59.911
bite it off.

43:01.871 --> 43:03.790
Pippi Longstocking
would bite a "D."

43:03.832 --> 43:05.875
That's for damn sure.

43:15.510 --> 43:17.470
FRENCHIE:
Butcher!

43:17.512 --> 43:19.014
Hold on, mon ami.

43:20.598 --> 43:22.350
-Give me your hand.
-Okay.

43:38.658 --> 43:40.785
No. No, Butcher! No!

43:40.827 --> 43:42.120
-Easy, easy, Butcher!
-HUGHIE: The CIA would have

43:42.162 --> 43:43.997
locked him up
in some black box forever,

43:44.039 --> 43:46.750
-and she never would have seen
her brother again.
-Easy.

43:47.751 --> 43:49.919
Both of you, please, not now.

43:54.883 --> 43:56.509
Right.

44:02.349 --> 44:04.184
You...

44:04.225 --> 44:06.102
fuck...

44:06.144 --> 44:07.771
off.

44:10.857 --> 44:12.525
The rest of you, with me.

44:13.568 --> 44:15.320
(objects clattering)

44:18.156 --> 44:19.783
Well, come on, don't piss about.

44:19.824 --> 44:21.618
We ain't got all night.

44:21.659 --> 44:23.328
(weapon cocking)

44:24.579 --> 44:26.873
(panting)

44:26.915 --> 44:28.792
Fuck you waiting for?

44:40.512 --> 44:42.472
Are you telling me

44:42.514 --> 44:45.225
that her family
is worth more to you

44:45.266 --> 44:46.476
than you seeing your own?

44:46.518 --> 44:49.896
No, I'm not.

44:49.938 --> 44:54.526
But Kimiko is one of us.

44:54.567 --> 44:57.529
I'll find another way.

44:57.570 --> 44:59.739
I suppose you agree, don't you?

44:59.781 --> 45:02.033
Since your tongue
is halfway up her ass.

45:02.075 --> 45:04.035
Jesus. It's like

45:04.077 --> 45:06.830
Hughie's infected you both
with a raging case of vagina.

45:21.219 --> 45:23.304
Becca's alive.

45:23.346 --> 45:25.306
What?

45:27.559 --> 45:30.895
She's alive. Vought's
holding her captive somewhere.

45:30.937 --> 45:32.897
-Butcher, if you...
-No.

45:32.939 --> 45:34.274
I'm not stark raving, all right?

45:34.315 --> 45:36.234
I fucking saw her.

45:39.779 --> 45:42.365
She had a little boy
with her. Uh...

45:42.407 --> 45:45.034
The spitting image
of Homelander.

45:45.076 --> 45:48.246
I thought he just wanted
to humiliate me,

45:48.288 --> 45:50.248
show me what he'd done
to my girl

45:50.290 --> 45:52.167
before he gave me the good news.

45:52.208 --> 45:53.710
Then I woke up

45:53.751 --> 45:55.712
three hours later
in a Tony fucking Cicero's.

45:55.753 --> 45:57.755
God knows why.

46:03.344 --> 46:05.722
I got to find her,

46:05.763 --> 46:09.184
and I got to get her
the fuck out of there.

46:11.186 --> 46:13.605
And I need your help to do it.

46:14.647 --> 46:16.232
Are you fucking with us?

46:16.274 --> 46:18.234
I find the terrorist
for Mallory,

46:18.276 --> 46:20.236
she finds Becca for me.

46:20.278 --> 46:21.613
That's the deal I made.

46:21.654 --> 46:23.531
I know what I done t-to you.

46:23.573 --> 46:24.991
All right?

46:25.033 --> 46:28.411
And by rights,
you should tell me to fuck off.

46:28.453 --> 46:29.996
But still...

46:30.038 --> 46:32.624
I'm asking.

46:47.096 --> 46:50.350
When you...

46:50.391 --> 46:52.435
When you disappeared
that night...

46:52.477 --> 46:55.146
I'm sorry.

46:55.188 --> 46:56.523
We were supposed to watch out
for each other

46:56.564 --> 46:58.399
and then you were gone.

47:04.531 --> 47:08.076
Shining Light sent me here.

47:08.117 --> 47:12.622
Put the needle in my spine

47:12.664 --> 47:15.708
and filled me full
of the blue poison.

47:17.752 --> 47:20.964
I should have found you.

47:21.005 --> 47:25.343
No. I'm the big sister. I should
have come back for you, but...

47:29.013 --> 47:32.517
...they made me into...

47:34.269 --> 47:37.730
...a monster.

47:37.772 --> 47:40.275
(chuckles, sniffles)

47:40.316 --> 47:44.112
If that's true,
we're both monsters now.

47:46.823 --> 47:48.825
Did it hurt?

47:48.866 --> 47:51.077
I wanted to die.

47:54.497 --> 47:56.541
Me too.

47:57.375 --> 47:59.877
They had one dose left

47:59.919 --> 48:02.255
and they knew it worked on you

48:02.297 --> 48:05.800
so they figured
it would work on me.

48:13.600 --> 48:15.685
I'm sorry.

48:15.727 --> 48:18.354
It's not your fault.

48:35.413 --> 48:36.998
(sniffles)

48:37.040 --> 48:39.334
It's not your fault.

48:49.886 --> 48:51.888
(Female crying)

48:57.685 --> 48:59.062
(sighs)

49:10.615 --> 49:11.991
(cabinet opens)

49:12.033 --> 49:13.576
(sonic boom)

49:13.618 --> 49:16.412
Who, uh, who we sexting?

49:16.454 --> 49:19.749
What... What are you doing
in here? Get out.

49:22.418 --> 49:24.212
-Uh, I d... Okay.
-(case unzipping)

49:24.253 --> 49:26.464
Look, you got me.
I'm having a heavy flow day.

49:26.506 --> 49:27.924
It's, uh...

49:29.759 --> 49:31.719
What are you doing with this?

49:31.761 --> 49:34.263
This is not how it looks.

49:34.305 --> 49:36.849
Okay? It's just
a misunderstanding.

49:36.891 --> 49:39.477
Homelander
should have charred your ass

49:39.519 --> 49:42.271
as soon as he found out
that you were fucking Hughie.

49:42.313 --> 49:43.690
Hughie saved your life.

49:43.731 --> 49:45.108
We both did.

49:46.150 --> 49:47.485
Your mistake.

49:47.527 --> 49:50.363
Okay, if you just give me
a minute, I can explain.

49:50.405 --> 49:53.533
You know, I just want you
to think about me

49:53.574 --> 49:55.368
when you're getting the skin

49:55.410 --> 49:58.705
peeled off your face, bitch.

50:03.793 --> 50:06.754
You're not gonna
tell anyone anything.

50:09.215 --> 50:11.175
Who says that I haven't already?

50:11.217 --> 50:13.386
'Cause then I'd already be dead.

50:13.428 --> 50:15.555
You're not gonna do shit.

50:15.596 --> 50:17.849
Why's that?

50:18.891 --> 50:21.561
'Cause you killed
your fucking girlfriend.

50:23.479 --> 50:27.275
That's what you told Hughie,
right? That you killed Popclaw?

50:31.112 --> 50:33.072
You can't prove anything.

50:33.114 --> 50:35.116
Did she suffer?

50:36.534 --> 50:40.496
Did you look
into her big, sad eyes

50:40.538 --> 50:42.123
while you did it?

50:43.583 --> 50:45.543
Fuck you.

50:45.585 --> 50:49.464
Yeah, see, I looked
at the Vought forensics report,

50:49.505 --> 50:51.841
and...
(exhales)

50:51.883 --> 50:53.259
Wow.

50:53.301 --> 50:55.386
All those needles
jammed into her arm

50:55.428 --> 50:57.221
at the same time?

50:57.263 --> 51:00.224
I mean, one of them
actually shattered the bone.

51:00.266 --> 51:02.810
Did you know that? Would someone
really do that to themselves?

51:02.852 --> 51:05.646
I mean, doesn't look
like an accident to me.

51:05.688 --> 51:08.191
I mean,
Vought's happy to bury it,

51:08.232 --> 51:11.778
but, you know, say, if...

51:11.819 --> 51:14.530
Sports Illustrated found out...

51:16.574 --> 51:19.118
If you do that,

51:19.160 --> 51:22.121
I'm gonna take you down
right with me.

51:22.163 --> 51:24.540
And then we'll both be dead.

51:24.582 --> 51:26.542
(scoffs)

51:26.584 --> 51:28.544
Go ahead.

51:28.586 --> 51:31.130
Fucking try it.

51:31.172 --> 51:33.549
I don't give a shit.

51:57.448 --> 52:00.284
(door closes)

52:02.328 --> 52:04.330
(sighs)

52:06.833 --> 52:10.628
These people you were with...

52:10.670 --> 52:13.297
They keep me safe.
They'll keep you safe too.

52:16.884 --> 52:19.804
Or we can go home.
Back to the village.

52:22.098 --> 52:23.850
There is no village anymore.

52:24.475 --> 52:26.227
What?

52:26.894 --> 52:28.229
They came for us.

52:28.271 --> 52:30.398
Who?

52:30.439 --> 52:31.649
The Americans.

52:31.691 --> 52:35.361
This hero came shrieking
out of the sky like a demon.

52:35.403 --> 52:38.781
Destroyed the camp. And all
the villages around it, too.

52:39.991 --> 52:42.159
There were bodies everywhere.

52:43.494 --> 52:44.871
Everyone's gone.

52:44.912 --> 52:47.832
Then we'll go somewhere else.
Back to Japan.

52:47.874 --> 52:50.793
Maybe grandma and grandpa
are still alive.

52:50.835 --> 52:52.753
You don't care?

52:52.795 --> 52:55.256
That the Superhero split
an old woman in half?

52:56.674 --> 52:58.885
That the entire school caved in
with the kids inside?

52:58.926 --> 53:00.261
That babies burned alive
in their cribs

53:00.303 --> 53:01.888
when the propane tanks exploded?

53:01.929 --> 53:05.308
I never wanted this.
But they were right all along.

53:05.349 --> 53:07.518
Shining Light is full of shit!

53:07.560 --> 53:10.062
Shining Light fights injustice.

53:10.104 --> 53:11.772
They stand up for people
without a voice.

53:11.814 --> 53:15.192
They murdered our parents!

53:15.234 --> 53:17.320
This country is an enemy
to the whole world now.

53:19.196 --> 53:21.240
We need to fight back.
Fight with me!

53:21.282 --> 53:26.662
You're the boy who nursed
every mouse who lost its mother.

53:29.165 --> 53:30.875
That was a long time ago.

53:31.751 --> 53:34.712
You're still my brother.

53:36.297 --> 53:40.301
Then... you know
I have to do this.

54:00.279 --> 54:03.240
âª âª

54:09.747 --> 54:11.374
(grunts)

54:24.261 --> 54:26.055

54:36.023 --> 54:37.274

54:52.373 --> 54:54.375
(Kenji breathing weakly)

54:55.668 --> 54:57.461
(tires screeching)

55:08.472 --> 55:10.224
Are you all right?

55:10.266 --> 55:11.851
Mon coeur!

55:15.438 --> 55:18.399
Well, cheers, love.

55:18.441 --> 55:21.277
At least someone's got
some sense around here.

55:48.637 --> 55:50.973
âª âª

56:02.485 --> 56:05.154
(grunts, exhales)

56:07.698 --> 56:11.827
You come between me
and my missus again,

56:11.869 --> 56:13.871
I'll fucking kill you.

56:15.581 --> 56:17.541
(exhales)

56:18.584 --> 56:20.586
(van door closes)

56:23.589 --> 56:25.549
(grunts)

56:25.591 --> 56:28.094
("Psycho Killer"
by Talking Heads playing)

56:37.144 --> 56:38.521
MOTHER'S MILK:
Hey, kid.

56:38.562 --> 56:40.314
Coming?

56:48.781 --> 56:51.742
âª I can't seem
to face up to the facts âª

56:51.784 --> 56:56.747
âª I'm tense and nervous,

56:56.789 --> 57:00.751
âª I can't sleep

âª Don't touch me,
