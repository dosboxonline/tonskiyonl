HOSTESS:
Hi.

01:46.524 --> 01:48.526
Welcome to Endless Pasta Week
at Tony Cicero's.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.070
Where the fuck am I?

01:51.111 --> 01:52.488
You're at Tony Cicero's.

01:52.530 --> 01:54.657
No, no.
What fucking city am I in?

01:54.698 --> 01:56.283
Uh, Fort Wayne.

01:56.325 --> 01:57.993
The fuck?

01:58.035 --> 02:00.746
You got a bit of paper,
something I can write with?

02:00.788 --> 02:02.039
A pen, anything.

02:02.081 --> 02:03.874
(muttering):
Ah, fuck it.

02:03.916 --> 02:06.168

NEWS ANCHOR:
Yesterday, it closed

02:09.004 --> 02:11.173
at ten percent below
its record high,

02:11.215 --> 02:13.551
set last month.

02:13.592 --> 02:16.178
Federal authorities have
initiated a multistate manhunt

02:16.220 --> 02:19.682
for William Butcher
for allegedly murdering

02:19.723 --> 02:22.184
Vought Vice President
Madelyn Stillwell

02:22.226 --> 02:25.437
as well as endangering
her infant son, Theodore.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.107
Law enforcement officials
have set up a tip line

02:28.148 --> 02:30.693
and are urging anyone
with information

02:30.734 --> 02:34.154
regarding the suspect's
whereabouts to come forward.

02:34.196 --> 02:37.157
Police are also asking...

02:44.164 --> 02:46.083
(sniffles)

02:46.166 --> 02:48.168
("Indé-Structible" by Guizmo
playing)

02:57.595 --> 03:01.015
"Boy, girl."

03:07.271 --> 03:09.231
I am sorry.

03:09.273 --> 03:11.066
I do not understand.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.659
All right, I'm off.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.912
-HUGHIE: Where you going?
-Going to meet a contact.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.622
Who?

03:24.663 --> 03:27.416
Someone who can help us find
this Supe terrorist cunt.

03:27.458 --> 03:28.626
Who is the contact?

03:28.667 --> 03:30.669
What is their actual name?

03:32.838 --> 03:34.757
-You'll love it.
-No, I won't.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.717
I won't love it.
I never love it.

03:36.759 --> 03:38.093
I never fucking love it!

03:40.512 --> 03:41.639
Noted.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.182
Not a word from him.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.851
He left us for dead, and now
it's like nothing happened?

03:52.191 --> 03:54.151
You're right.

03:54.193 --> 03:56.153
I am sorry.

03:56.195 --> 03:59.073
Sorry that I trusted this lot
was smart enough

03:59.114 --> 04:01.992
to save themselves like they've
done a hundred times before.

04:02.034 --> 04:03.369
Okay, well, where you been?

04:03.410 --> 04:05.788
Well, technically,
I called him back.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.957
He blew up Madelyn Stillwell.

04:07.998 --> 04:11.585
I told you. She was already dead
when I blew her up.

04:11.627 --> 04:13.963
Oh. Great. Cool.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.632
Totally. We're just gonna
pretend like this is normal?

04:16.674 --> 04:18.258
Like we're fucking lemmings?

04:28.936 --> 04:31.480
Well, who else
they gonna follow?

04:38.570 --> 04:40.572
Right.

04:47.746 --> 04:50.624
(birds chirping)

04:50.666 --> 04:52.501
(grunts)

04:52.543 --> 04:55.462
(laughs softly)

04:55.504 --> 04:58.090
Hey. You know, my dad,

04:58.132 --> 05:01.051
he had a ball
from the '56 World Series.

05:01.093 --> 05:02.970
Signed by Don Larsen himself.

05:03.012 --> 05:04.972
Pitched a no-hitter in Game 5.

05:05.014 --> 05:06.598
Really?

05:06.640 --> 05:09.268
Pretty cool, huh?

05:09.309 --> 05:12.438
Ooh. That's okay. Uh...

05:12.479 --> 05:14.648
You'll, uh,
you'll get the next one.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.525
-Yeah.
-Yeah!

05:16.567 --> 05:18.152
RYAN:
Yeah, I'll get the next one.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.905
(sighs)

05:21.947 --> 05:23.741
Okay.

05:23.782 --> 05:27.036
Ryan. Use your powers.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.328
What do you mean?

05:33.375 --> 05:35.502
RYAN:
Huh.

05:35.544 --> 05:36.795
I can't do that.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.923
Yes, you can. You're my son.

05:41.633 --> 05:46.472
Has anyone told you
what you're capable of?

05:48.307 --> 05:49.516
No.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.396
Well, then it's about time
you found out.

05:54.438 --> 05:57.274
BECCA:
Hey, Ryan? Come on.
Math time, buddy.

05:57.316 --> 05:58.901
Chapters 12 and 13
in your workbook.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.486
(exhales)
Yeah.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.571
Math, yeah. Sorry, I forgot.

06:02.613 --> 06:04.573
BECCA:
It's your favorite.

06:04.615 --> 06:06.325
Be in in a minute, okay?

06:06.366 --> 06:07.993
HOMELANDER:
You know, when I was his age,

06:08.035 --> 06:11.080
I was breaking
the sound barrier.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.290
He can't even throw a fastball.

06:13.332 --> 06:14.958
We thought it was best
that he have

06:15.000 --> 06:17.503
as ordinary
of a childhood as possible.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.505
We?

06:19.546 --> 06:21.381
-Who's we?
-Look,

06:21.423 --> 06:24.093
I just want my kid to be normal.

06:25.636 --> 06:28.430
Well, then,
it's a good thing I'm here.

06:28.472 --> 06:30.599
'Cause my son
is the furthest fucking thing

06:30.641 --> 06:33.602
on this planet
to a normal little boy.

06:33.644 --> 06:36.438
How long are you planning
on staying?

06:37.481 --> 06:40.609
Becca, we had a deal.

06:40.651 --> 06:42.986
A deal that is alive and well

06:43.028 --> 06:46.573
and-and running around
as free as a goddam bird.

06:46.615 --> 06:50.035
So, let's just

06:50.077 --> 06:51.829
try and be civil, shall we?

07:10.722 --> 07:12.724
Did I get 'em right?

07:14.560 --> 07:16.603
There's...

07:16.645 --> 07:19.773
There's no correct
or incorrect answer.

07:19.815 --> 07:21.525
Oh.

07:23.569 --> 07:25.821
What is missing here?

07:28.031 --> 07:31.076
DEEP:
Uh...

07:33.078 --> 07:37.207
Deep, how do you expect to be
welcomed back into The Seven

07:37.249 --> 07:39.293
if you can't be honest
with yourself?

07:39.334 --> 07:42.379
Carol, if I'm being honest,

07:42.421 --> 07:44.339
I don't know
what the fuck you want from me.

07:44.381 --> 07:45.465
(door closes)

07:46.592 --> 07:48.552
Hey, guys.

07:48.594 --> 07:49.845
How's it going?

07:49.887 --> 07:51.889
Can I have a word?

07:53.849 --> 07:55.809
I don't mean to be negative,

07:55.851 --> 08:00.022
but his operating perspective
is functionally nonexistent.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.232
(whispering): I don't think
there's a path here.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.443
Leave it to me.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.861
(tea kettle whistling)

08:05.903 --> 08:07.821
EAGLE:
See, you're just inhibited

08:07.863 --> 08:10.240
by suppressive energy,
that's it.

08:10.282 --> 08:12.492
Just got to realign things.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.494
What is it? Shrooms?

08:14.536 --> 08:17.372
Last time I did shrooms was
at a Goo Goo Dolls concert

08:17.414 --> 08:20.209
with some poli sci chick
from Oberlin.

08:21.877 --> 08:24.713
I guess I'd call it more
of a gateway.

08:29.468 --> 08:32.054
(coughs sharply, chuckles)

08:33.680 --> 08:35.766
Wait.
Are you not gonna drink any?

08:35.807 --> 08:39.603
No. Deep, this is your journey.

08:44.816 --> 08:47.903
STARLIGHT:
Who's revving up the girl power
in The Seven?

08:47.945 --> 08:49.947
Keep watching, WDCS,

08:49.988 --> 08:53.158
Cleveland's first
and best source for local news.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.993
MAN:
Quiet, please.
Going again. On the bell.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.578
-(bell rings)
-MAN 2: Rolling.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.372
Where should I start?
Are you ready

08:58.413 --> 09:00.123
to meet the newest member
of The Seven?

09:00.165 --> 09:02.125
See it here first, WFAK.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.794
KMFT. WDCS.

09:03.835 --> 09:05.462
-WOMAN: Cut!
-(bell rings)
-Quiet please. Still rolling.

09:05.504 --> 09:07.130
She's the newest member
of The Seven,

09:07.172 --> 09:09.007
and she's taking America
by storm.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.509
From Portland to Seattle.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.552
Watch what comes next, KMFT.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.888
ASHLEY:
Amazing.

09:14.930 --> 09:16.390
Do you need to take a break,

09:16.431 --> 09:17.891
or can we power
through the rest?

09:17.933 --> 09:19.643
Let's just power through.

09:19.685 --> 09:21.812
-(camera shutters clicking)
-(cheering, indistinct chatter)

09:21.853 --> 09:25.107
WOMAN:
Hey, over here!
Give us a shot! Gorgeous!

09:25.148 --> 09:27.484
-(camera shutters clicking)
-Starlight! Oh!

09:27.526 --> 09:30.570
-Stormfront, over here!
-Stormfront, show us
what you got!

09:30.612 --> 09:32.823
-We're ready!
-(reporters oohing)

09:32.864 --> 09:35.075
-(whooping and cheering)
-(laughs)

09:35.117 --> 09:36.910
ASHLEY:
Okay, ladies,

09:36.952 --> 09:39.371
we have a big day--
domestic outlets until noon,

09:39.413 --> 09:41.581
ten minutes each,
foreign until 2:00.

09:41.623 --> 09:44.376
Round tables until 4:00,
print one-on-ones until 6:00.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.169
Jesus,
if she vibrates any faster,

09:46.211 --> 09:48.380
-that stick up her ass
is gonna explode.
-(laughs)

09:48.422 --> 09:50.132
-(phone buzzing)
-We really should
be powering through.

09:50.173 --> 09:51.758
We don't have time.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.969
Hello?

09:57.764 --> 09:59.725
What?

09:59.766 --> 10:01.768
When?

10:04.229 --> 10:06.523
Okay. Thank you.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.358
ASHLEY:
We're going positive,
we're going female,

10:08.400 --> 10:09.943
thoughtful but upbeat.

10:09.985 --> 10:11.862
-Where... What?
-MAEVE: I gotta go.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.698
-What? No.
-I'm sorry. Family emergency.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.116
-Is everything okay?
-Maeve,

10:16.158 --> 10:18.118
we've never had three women
in The Seven before.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.871
This is a moment. Girls get it
done. You are not...!

10:23.248 --> 10:25.292
I have a family emergency, too.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.129
PASTOR:
A reading
from the Book of Revelations.

10:29.171 --> 10:32.007
"And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes,

10:32.049 --> 10:33.633
and there will be
no more death."

10:33.675 --> 10:36.011
Today, we say goodbye
to Susan Raynor.

10:36.053 --> 10:40.432
For though her body rests, her
soul lives on for all eternity.

10:40.474 --> 10:42.601
And one day,
you will think of Susan

10:42.642 --> 10:45.103
with joy as well as sadness.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.106
They are two sides of a coin
you will carry forever.

10:48.148 --> 10:52.611
And you are blessed
to have your family

10:52.652 --> 10:54.821
and your friends
to help you carry it.

10:54.863 --> 10:57.157
In the name of Christ. Amen.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.161
(two beeps)

11:04.498 --> 11:06.291
(sighs)

11:06.333 --> 11:08.919
You think you can surprise me?

11:08.960 --> 11:12.089
I literally taught you this one.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.511
Hello, Grace.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.513
You promised
I'd never see you again.

11:19.554 --> 11:22.224
I promised...

11:22.265 --> 11:24.518
not to come to your house again.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.940
A subtle
but important distinction.

11:29.981 --> 11:32.067
I assume
you sent the edible arrangement?

11:32.109 --> 11:33.527
Deluxe Bereavement Bouquet

11:33.568 --> 11:35.779
with white chocolate-dipped
pineapple doves.

11:35.821 --> 11:38.115
Raynor would have loved that.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.620
Oi, where you going?

11:43.662 --> 11:45.539
There are about
two dozen federal officers

11:45.580 --> 11:47.374
in the church next door.

11:47.416 --> 11:50.127
I'm gonna turn you in for the
murder of Madelyn Stillwell.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.754
Oh, come off it, Grace.
You really think I done that?

11:52.796 --> 11:54.589
You really want me
to answer that?

11:54.631 --> 11:57.467
Grace, I know who killed Raynor!

12:01.721 --> 12:03.682
Who?

12:03.723 --> 12:06.017
Okay, well, uh,
I don't specifically,

12:06.059 --> 12:09.563
technically have the answer to
that, but I know how to get it.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.359
We think Vought killed her for
getting too close to something.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.652
Getting too close to what?

12:15.694 --> 12:17.070
Something to do
with a Supe terrorist

12:17.112 --> 12:18.697
smuggled into Jersey
a couple of nights ago,

12:18.738 --> 12:20.991
-and that is where we start.
-(laughing): Honestly,

12:21.032 --> 12:23.702
it's like asking a cockroach
to not be a cockroach.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.287
It's just your nature.

12:25.328 --> 12:27.038
I know what she meant to you,
all right?

12:27.080 --> 12:29.124
We find this terrorist,
and we're one step closer

12:29.166 --> 12:30.584
to finding out who offed her.

12:30.625 --> 12:31.960
I'm not getting back in.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.378
And if I were, which I'm not,

12:33.420 --> 12:35.005
it sure as shit wouldn't be
for you.

12:35.046 --> 12:37.591
Oh, I ain't asking you
all the way back in.

12:37.632 --> 12:39.634
Just dip in a little toe, yeah?

12:39.676 --> 12:42.762
Maybe two.
Not for me. For Raynor.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.598
You never gave a shit
about Susan.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.141
You're only here
because you're desperate,

12:46.183 --> 12:47.934
fucked, and you want something.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.896
All right, fuck it.
Grace? Grace!

12:50.937 --> 12:54.191
Grace, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

12:54.232 --> 12:56.151
I'll level with you, okay?

12:56.193 --> 12:58.862
(exhales)
Just hear me out.

12:58.904 --> 13:00.906
(panting)

13:03.074 --> 13:06.828
(singing along): ♪ I just want
you to know who I am ♪

Okay.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.007
Remember Melissa Dabrowski,

14:01.049 --> 14:03.635
the kindergarten teacher
you fingerbanged backstage

14:03.677 --> 14:05.929
at the VH1 Educator Awards?

14:05.971 --> 14:07.264
So what?

14:07.305 --> 14:09.641
You were supposed to present her
with Teacher of the Year,

14:09.683 --> 14:12.978
but you bailed while she was
pulling her panties back on.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.188
Yeah, because she laughed at me.

14:15.230 --> 14:16.523
Okay, bullshit.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.066
She just put her hands
on your chest.

14:18.108 --> 14:19.776
You never even unzipped
your suit.

14:19.818 --> 14:20.902
She would have laughed.

14:20.944 --> 14:22.737
Because that's what you do.

14:22.779 --> 14:26.074
You imagine women will laugh at
us, so you humiliate them first.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.784
No, that's-that's not true.

14:27.826 --> 14:31.288
You can't accept your own body,
so you violate theirs.

14:31.329 --> 14:33.790
(stammers)
Shut the fuck up.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.625
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.628
(panting)
Hey. Hey. Hey.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.880
(chuckles)

14:40.922 --> 14:42.591
-You can't swim from us forever!
-Let me out!

14:42.632 --> 14:45.093
You shut the fuck up,
you ugly pieces of shit.

14:45.135 --> 14:47.095
I have nothing else
to say to you.

14:47.137 --> 14:49.306
-We won't let you shut us up
anymore, Kevin!
-(whimpering)

14:49.347 --> 14:51.725
Hey. Hey! Hey!

14:51.766 --> 14:53.977
Let me out, man.
Just let me out!

(sighs)

15:24.549 --> 15:26.551
What are you doing here?

15:28.928 --> 15:31.306
Apparently, your work...

15:31.348 --> 15:34.726
still has "Maggie Shaw"
as your emergency contact.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.687
Ah, shit. Sorry.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.731
That's okay.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.902
Where else would I score
this sweet jelly?

15:43.943 --> 15:45.945
(Elena laughs)

15:47.364 --> 15:49.449
I thought it was bad unagi.

15:49.491 --> 15:52.035
Turns out,
my appendix was about to burst.

15:52.077 --> 15:55.288
Well, there are easier ways
to get my attention.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.876
I kept thinking you'd call.

16:01.419 --> 16:04.214
Yeah. Me, too.

16:04.255 --> 16:07.050
-You want me to call your mom?
-(laughs)

16:07.092 --> 16:10.428
Definitely not.
(groans)

16:10.470 --> 16:14.641
Someone else,
like a girlfriend, or...?

16:14.683 --> 16:16.893
Seriously, thanks for coming,

16:16.935 --> 16:19.020
but I'm sure you have
more important places to be.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.981
Hey, you could die
from something like this.

16:22.023 --> 16:24.651
But I didn't, so I guess
you don't need to save me.

16:24.693 --> 16:27.529
Yeah, well, I still want
to see the doctor.

16:27.570 --> 16:30.573
Maeve, I'm fine, I promise.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.080
(Elena sighs)

16:37.122 --> 16:39.874
You know, watching Botched
doesn't make you

16:39.916 --> 16:42.794
-a fucking medical expert.
-(scoffs)

16:42.836 --> 16:45.630
I'll wait a while
and just see, okay?

16:47.298 --> 16:48.675
Can we get this middle chair out
of here, please?

16:48.717 --> 16:50.093
Yeah. Somebody?
Thank you. Thank you.

16:50.135 --> 16:51.761
Can we get the two on the side
just smushed together?

16:51.803 --> 16:53.805
We lost one of them.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.724
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Okay,

-Rolling.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.565
I don't know!
I don't think so!

17:03.606 --> 17:05.483
(chuckles)
Can you tell us a little

17:05.525 --> 17:06.901
about how girls get it done?

17:06.943 --> 17:07.902
REPORTER 3:

17:10.196 --> 17:11.197
Let's dish boys.

17:11.239 --> 17:12.907
Starlight, single?
Or, uh, spoken for?

17:12.949 --> 17:14.200
Uh, single, single.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.869
Single.
Uh, single.

17:15.910 --> 17:18.163
Definitely single.
(chuckles)

17:18.204 --> 17:20.874
Tell us how fun it is
to have all this girl power.

-REPORTER 1:
Can you repeat that but say

17:22.917 --> 17:27.130
"strong is the new pretty"
right at the end?

17:27.172 --> 17:28.423
Do girls make better heroes?

17:28.465 --> 17:30.425
Do girls make better heroes
than boys?

17:30.467 --> 17:32.886
Do girls make better heroes?

17:32.927 --> 17:34.262
Look, uh, no offense.

17:34.304 --> 17:36.055
I-I get you have
your talking points,

17:36.097 --> 17:39.350
but why does it matter whether
heroes have a dick or a vag?

17:39.392 --> 17:42.228
(chuckles): I mean, shouldn't we
all just, you know, be competent

17:42.270 --> 17:43.772
at our jobs?

17:43.813 --> 17:45.940
I-I don't think
girls do anything better.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.942
I think chicks and dicks
are in it together.

17:49.486 --> 17:50.487
(phone buzzing)

17:50.528 --> 17:51.571
Oh, that's me.

17:54.324 --> 17:55.533

17:55.575 --> 17:57.744
(chuckles):
Sorry, Ashy.

17:57.786 --> 18:00.246
Vought won't let me have pockets
in this thing.

18:00.288 --> 18:02.290
You can see every crease
in my ass.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.584
You can practically see
up Starlight's uterus.

18:04.626 --> 18:05.585
You want to talk
about girl power,

18:05.627 --> 18:07.420
let's talk
about getting some pockets.

18:07.462 --> 18:08.421

18:08.463 --> 18:10.423
Starlight,
your teammate, A-Train,

18:10.465 --> 18:12.425
has been out of the public eye.

18:12.467 --> 18:15.011
-Mm-hmm.
-Vought recently revealed

18:15.053 --> 18:17.931
that he was on a top secret
mission in Kandahar.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.265
Are you worried about him?

18:19.307 --> 18:21.017
(clears throat)
Yeah, of course.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.019
I pray for him every night.

18:23.061 --> 18:25.605
(inhales)
America really is lucky

18:25.647 --> 18:28.024

fighting for them.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.711
Stormfront, you know,
it is such an honor to meet you.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.129
-Oh.
-I'm a huge fan.

18:50.171 --> 18:51.798
-Feeling's mutual.
-Don't get up. Yeah, relax.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.717
Relax for a second. Um,
maybe get a chair or something.

in a manatee's belly

25:27.526 --> 25:29.445
Hey. Um...

25:29.487 --> 25:32.031
I just got to say,

25:32.073 --> 25:35.618
I really like everything that
you've been saying about Vought.

25:35.660 --> 25:36.994
Yeah, okay, cool.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.412
No, I mean...

25:38.454 --> 25:40.164
I agree with you.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.500
You wearing a wire or something?

25:42.541 --> 25:44.043
What? What does that have to...

25:44.085 --> 25:46.671
Look, I mean this
in the nicest possible way,

25:46.712 --> 25:49.048
but I don't need
some fucking Vought Spy Barbie

25:49.090 --> 25:51.092
sniffing around to see
whether I'm a team player.

25:51.133 --> 25:53.552
What? That is

25:53.594 --> 25:56.097
not at all what I am.

25:56.138 --> 25:57.515
I used to be a fan.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.267
But look at you.

25:59.308 --> 26:03.312
You're like the Voughtiest
Vought in all Vought.

26:08.359 --> 26:12.029

trying to get your attention.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.699
(quietly):
Fuck.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.617
What happened to your eye?

26:16.659 --> 26:18.786
Oh, Vought is testing
a new volumizing

26:18.828 --> 26:20.788

26:24.792 --> 26:26.794
I brought you a sample.

26:29.797 --> 26:31.257
Are you kidding me?

26:31.299 --> 26:32.883
I can't take this right now.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.260
I can't get away

26:54.822 --> 26:56.449
Yeah.

in your boot?

just put something in your boot.

That was the deal.

Homelander is quite upset

was concealed from him.

29:32.229 --> 29:33.439

Just keep him calm.

30:04.428 --> 30:05.721

30:05.763 --> 30:07.348
he'll get bored and move on.

Homelander and I went

31:16.292 --> 31:18.294
for 12 Years a Slave.

31:18.335 --> 31:21.213
There was this producer,
he swapped place cards

31:21.255 --> 31:23.007
so he could sit next to me.

31:23.048 --> 31:24.925
And he chatted me up all night.

31:24.967 --> 31:28.137
Two days later,
there's a fire in his office.

31:28.178 --> 31:31.599
They found his head
in one room...

31:31.640 --> 31:34.351
and his torso in another.

31:35.352 --> 31:37.521
What are you saying?

31:38.897 --> 31:41.692
I don't want him
to do that to you.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.833

32:01.420 --> 32:04.173
...the things
that he made me do...

32:09.219 --> 32:12.014
If he ever finds out
about you...

32:12.056 --> 32:14.516
(takes deep breath)

32:15.559 --> 32:18.062
Why are you telling me this now?

32:25.235 --> 32:27.863
I don't want you
to hate me anymore.

32:29.823 --> 32:31.533
Cool.

32:31.575 --> 32:33.702
-Thank you.
-(chuckles)

32:33.744 --> 32:35.287
You're welcome.

32:35.329 --> 32:38.248
It's crazy you don't have one
already, actually.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.876
I don't really have anyone
to call, though.

32:40.918 --> 32:42.211
(sighs)

32:42.252 --> 32:43.587
You could call me.

32:46.006 --> 32:48.133
You know, Ryan, um,

32:48.175 --> 32:51.970
when I was your age, I didn't
have many friends either.

32:52.012 --> 32:55.557
Mom says being lonely
makes you know yourself better.

32:55.599 --> 32:56.892
Well...

32:56.934 --> 32:59.395
that's not wrong, I suppose.

33:02.022 --> 33:03.982
Can I tell you a secret?

33:04.024 --> 33:06.527

33:19.373 --> 33:23.252

yard with a World Series ball.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.463
Truth is...

33:26.505 --> 33:28.924
I never had a dad.

33:30.217 --> 33:31.760
Or a mom.

33:32.803 --> 33:35.472
Wait, you... you didn't?

33:38.058 --> 33:42.187
See, sometimes it's hard, Ryan,

33:42.229 --> 33:44.523

(sighs)

33:44.565 --> 33:47.109
superior to every single
other person on the planet.

33:47.151 --> 33:49.319
It's-it's... isolating.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.488
And gods...

33:51.530 --> 33:55.909
should not have to feel
that kind of...

33:55.951 --> 33:57.828
yeah, pain.

33:58.996 --> 34:00.372
Because that...

34:00.414 --> 34:03.751
is what we are, Ryan.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.213
You and me.

34:11.175 --> 34:13.135
We're gods.

34:16.221 --> 34:21.393
Son, we can do anything we want.

34:21.435 --> 34:24.229
And no one can stop us.

34:24.271 --> 34:27.399
Now, that..

34:27.441 --> 34:30.027
that's a good feeling.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.279
A really good feeling.

34:33.489 --> 34:36.825
And now you...

34:36.867 --> 34:39.161
and me...

34:39.203 --> 34:41.997
can share it together.

34:45.501 --> 34:46.960
I...

34:47.002 --> 34:49.588
I-I should probably go
to bed now, you know?

35:07.898 --> 35:09.983
You know, you can say it back.

35:10.025 --> 35:12.069
Um, I...

swim in the ocean,

Hmm?

Don't.

41:28.528 --> 41:30.197
Maybe...

41:30.238 --> 41:33.491
I want to say everything
that you're saying about Vought.

41:33.533 --> 41:35.911

42:03.855 --> 42:05.857
Hmm, Homelander?

42:05.899 --> 42:08.276
No. Pippi Longstocking.

42:09.611 --> 42:11.571
Pippi Longstocking.
She's a nine-year-old girl.

42:11.613 --> 42:13.198
Lived in a house all by herself.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.408
Pet monkey. Could lift
a horse with one hand.

42:15.450 --> 42:17.410
You-you haven't read
Pippi Longstocking?

42:17.452 --> 42:19.037
I guess not.

42:19.079 --> 42:20.622
Hmm.

42:20.664 --> 42:24.417
Okay, well, uh, I used to dress
as her every Halloween,

42:24.459 --> 42:26.586
and all the girls dressed
like Disney sluts

42:26.628 --> 42:28.505
would make fun of me,
and you know what I thought?

42:28.546 --> 42:31.049
I thought, "Who fucking cares?"

42:31.091 --> 42:32.133
Pippi didn't care.

42:32.175 --> 42:34.386
She never cared
about being polite.

42:34.427 --> 42:36.346
Or cute.

42:36.388 --> 42:38.098
Look.

42:38.139 --> 42:42.769
Fuck this world
for confusing nice with good.

42:42.811 --> 42:44.646
Be a bitch if you want.
Be whatever.

42:44.688 --> 42:47.649
Just drop the mask
once in a while.

42:47.691 --> 42:48.942
Feels good.

42:48.984 --> 42:51.111
You can finally breathe.

42:54.990 --> 42:57.742
Oh, and if someone sticks
a dick in your mouth,

42:57.784 --> 42:59.911
bite it off.

43:01.871 --> 43:03.790
Pippi Longstocking
would bite a "D."

43:03.832 --> 43:05.875
That's for damn sure.

43:15.510 --> 43:17.470
FRENCHIE:
Butcher!

43:17.512 --> 43:19.014
Hold on, mon ami.

43:20.598 --> 43:22.350
-Give me your hand.
-Okay.

43:38.658 --> 43:40.785
No. No, Butcher! No!

43:40.827 --> 43:42.120
-Easy, easy, Butcher!
-HUGHIE: The CIA would have

43:42.162 --> 43:43.997
locked him up
in some black box forever,

43:44.039 --> 43:46.750
-and she never would have seen
her brother again.
-Easy.

43:47.751 --> 43:49.919
Both of you, please, not now.

43:54.883 --> 43:56.509
Right.

44:02.349 --> 44:04.184
You...

44:04.225 --> 44:06.102
fuck...

44:06.144 --> 44:07.771

44:10.857 --> 44:12.525
The rest of you, with me.

44:13.568 --> 44:15.320
(objects clattering)

44:18.156 --> 44:19.783
Well, come on, don't piss about.

44:26.915 --> 44:28.792
Fuck you waiting for?

44:40.512 --> 44:42.472
Are you telling me

44:42.514 --> 44:45.225
that her family
is worth more to you

44:45.266 --> 44:46.476
than you seeing your own?

44:46.518 --> 44:49.896
No, I'm not.

44:49.938 --> 44:54.526
But Kimiko is one of us.

44:54.567 --> 44:57.529
I'll find another way.

44:57.570 --> 44:59.739
I suppose you agree, don't you?

44:59.781 --> 45:02.033
Since your tongue
is halfway up her ass.

45:02.075 --> 45:04.035
Jesus. It's like

45:04.077 --> 45:06.830
Hughie's infected you both
with a raging case of vagina.

45:21.219 --> 45:23.304
Becca's alive.

45:23.346 --> 45:25.306
What?

45:27.559 --> 45:30.895
She's alive. Vought's
holding her captive somewhere.

45:30.937 --> 45:32.897
-Butcher, if you...
-No.

45:32.939 --> 45:34.274
I'm not stark raving, all right?

45:34.315 --> 45:36.234
I fucking saw her.

45:39.779 --> 45:42.365
She had a little boy
with her. Uh...

45:42.407 --> 45:45.034
The spitting image
of Homelander.

45:45.076 --> 45:48.246
I thought he just wanted
to humiliate me,

45:48.288 --> 45:50.248
show me what he'd done
to my girl

45:50.290 --> 45:52.167
before he gave me the good news.

45:52.208 --> 45:53.710
Then I woke up

45:53.751 --> 45:55.712
three hours later
in a Tony fucking Cicero's.

45:55.753 --> 45:57.755
God knows why.

46:03.344 --> 46:05.722
I got to find her,

46:05.763 --> 46:09.184
and I got to get her
the fuck out of there.

46:11.186 --> 46:13.605
And I need your help to do it.

46:14.647 --> 46:16.232
Are you fucking with us?

46:16.274 --> 46:18.234
I find the terrorist
for Mallory,

46:18.276 --> 46:20.236
she finds Becca for me.

46:20.278 --> 46:21.613
That's the deal I made.

46:21.654 --> 46:23.531
I know what I done t-to you.

46:23.573 --> 46:24.991
All right?

46:25.033 --> 46:28.411
And by rights,
you should tell me to fuck off.

46:28.453 --> 46:29.996
But still...

46:30.038 --> 46:32.624
I'm asking.

46:47.096 --> 46:50.350
When you...

46:50.391 --> 46:52.435
When you disappeared
that night...

46:52.477 --> 46:55.146
I'm sorry.

46:55.188 --> 46:56.523
We were supposed to watch out
for each other

46:56.564 --> 46:58.399
and then you were gone.

47:04.531 --> 47:08.076
Shining Light sent me here.

47:08.117 --> 47:12.622
Put the needle in my spine

47:12.664 --> 47:15.708
and filled me full
of the blue poison.

47:17.752 --> 47:20.964
I should have found you.

47:21.005 --> 47:25.343
No. I'm the big sister. I should
have come back for you, but...

47:29.013 --> 47:32.517
...they made me into...

47:34.269 --> 47:37.730
...a monster.

47:37.772 --> 47:40.275
(chuckles, sniffles)

47:40.316 --> 47:44.112
If that's true,
we're both monsters now.

47:46.823 --> 47:48.825
Did it hurt?

47:48.866 --> 47:51.077
I wanted to die.

47:54.497 --> 47:56.541
Me too.

47:57.375 --> 47:59.877
They had one dose left

47:59.919 --> 48:02.255
and they knew it worked on you

48:02.297 --> 48:05.800
so they figured
it would work on me.

48:13.600 --> 48:15.685
I'm sorry.

48:15.727 --> 48:18.354
It's not your fault.

48:35.413 --> 48:36.998
(sniffles)

48:37.040 --> 48:39.334

49:16.454 --> 49:19.749
What... What are you doing
in here? Get out.

49:22.418 --> 49:24.212
-Uh, I d... Okay.
-(case unzipping)

49:24.253 --> 49:26.464
Look, you got me.
I'm having a heavy flow day.

49:26.506 --> 49:27.924

49:29.759 --> 49:31.719
What are you doing with this?

49:31.761 --> 49:34.263
This is not how it looks.

49:34.305 --> 49:36.849
Okay? It's just
a misunderstanding.

49:36.891 --> 49:39.477
Homelander
should have charred your ass

49:39.519 --> 49:42.271
as soon as he found out
that you were fucking Hughie.

49:42.313 --> 49:43.690
Hughie saved your life.

49:43.731 --> 49:45.108
We both did.

49:46.150 --> 49:47.485
Your mistake.

49:47.527 --> 49:50.363
Okay, if you just give me
a minute, I can explain.

49:50.405 --> 49:53.533
You know, I just want you
to think about me

49:53.574 --> 49:55.368
when you're getting the skin

49:55.410 --> 49:58.705
peeled off your face, bitch.

50:03.793 --> 50:06.754
You're not gonna
tell anyone anything.

50:09.215 --> 50:11.175
Who says that I haven't already?

50:11.217 --> 50:13.386
'Cause then I'd already be dead.

50:13.428 --> 50:15.555
You're not gonna do shit.

50:15.596 --> 50:17.849
Why's that?

50:18.891 --> 50:21.561
'Cause you killed
your fucking girlfriend.

50:23.479 --> 50:27.275
That's what you told Hughie,
right? That you killed Popclaw?

50:31.112 --> 50:33.072
You can't prove anything.

50:33.114 --> 50:35.116
Did she suffer?

50:36.534 --> 50:40.496
Did you look
into her big, sad eyes

50:40.538 --> 50:42.123
while you did it?

50:43.583 --> 50:45.543
Fuck you.

50:45.585 --> 50:49.464
Yeah, see, I looked
at the Vought forensics report,

50:49.505 --> 50:51.841
and...
(exhales)

50:51.883 --> 50:53.259
Wow.

50:53.301 --> 50:55.386
All those needles
jammed into her arm

50:55.428 --> 50:57.221
at the same time?

50:57.263 --> 51:00.224
I mean, one of them
actually shattered the bone.

51:00.266 --> 51:02.810
Did you know that? Would someone
really do that to themselves?

51:02.852 --> 51:05.646
I mean, doesn't look
like an accident to me.

51:05.688 --> 51:08.191
I mean,
Vought's happy to bury it,

51:08.232 --> 51:11.778
but, you know, say, if...

51:11.819 --> 51:14.530
Sports Illustrated found out...

51:16.574 --> 51:19.118
If you do that,

51:19.160 --> 51:22.121
I'm gonna take you down
right with me.

51:22.163 --> 51:24.540
And then we'll both be dead.

51:24.582 --> 51:26.542
(scoffs)

51:26.584 --> 51:28.544
Go ahead.

51:28.586 --> 51:31.130
Fucking try it.

51:31.172 --> 51:33.549
I don't give a shit.

51:57.448 --> 52:00.284
(door closes)

52:02.328 --> 52:04.330
(sighs)

52:06.833 --> 52:10.628
These people you were with...

52:10.670 --> 52:13.297
They keep me safe.
They'll keep you safe too.

52:16.884 --> 52:19.804
Or we can go home.
Back to the village.

52:22.098 --> 52:23.850
There is no village anymore.

52:24.475 --> 52:26.227
What?

52:26.894 --> 52:28.229
They came for us.

52:28.271 --> 52:30.398
Who?

52:30.439 --> 52:31.649
The Americans.

52:31.691 --> 52:35.361
This hero came shrieking
out of the sky like a demon.

52:35.403 --> 52:38.781
Destroyed the camp. And all
the villages around it, too.

52:39.991 --> 52:42.159
There were bodies everywhere.

52:43.494 --> 52:44.871
Everyone's gone.

52:44.912 --> 52:47.832
Then we'll go somewhere else.
Back to Japan.

52:47.874 --> 52:50.793
Maybe grandma and grandpa
are still alive.

52:50.835 --> 52:52.753
You don't care?

52:52.795 --> 52:55.256
That the Superhero split
an old woman in half?

52:56.674 --> 52:58.885
That the entire school caved in
with the kids inside?

52:58.926 --> 53:00.261
That babies burned alive
in their cribs

53:00.303 --> 53:01.888
