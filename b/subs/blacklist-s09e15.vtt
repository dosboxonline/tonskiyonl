You sure this is his place?

00:30.321 --> 00:32.949
According to his student record,
this is it.

00:33.491 --> 00:34.659
Then who is that?

00:34.743 --> 00:37.162
[Raymond] I'm guessing his roommate.

00:37.245 --> 00:39.748
I'll go say hello. You check the bedrooms.

00:46.045 --> 00:47.088
-What the--?
-[music stops]

00:47.172 --> 00:48.798
I'm sorry to startle.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.967
We're looking for Andrew Kennison.

00:51.050 --> 00:53.511
-Who the hell are you? How did you get in?
-Shh.

00:53.595 --> 00:54.846
I should clarify.

00:54.929 --> 00:56.890
I'm not taking questions.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.350
That's unfortunate.

00:59.434 --> 01:00.977
-What's your name?
-Marcus.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.604
Marcus, relax.

01:02.687 --> 01:03.980
Our business is with Andrew.

01:04.064 --> 01:04.981
Andrew's not here.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.191
You're his roommate?

01:06.274 --> 01:08.485
-Yes. We're in the same graduate program.
-Ah.

01:08.568 --> 01:11.112
You must be a smart young fellow, Marcus.

01:11.196 --> 01:13.031
Smart enough to tell us where Andrew is.

01:13.114 --> 01:14.491
But I don't know.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.034
[Raymond] When do you expect him?

01:16.117 --> 01:17.035
I don't know.

01:17.118 --> 01:18.119
Andrew's missing.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.329
Missing?

01:19.412 --> 01:20.789
It's been a few weeks.

01:20.872 --> 01:23.208
He left to go to the library
at 5:00 p.m. to study.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.960
We had a Phys-Chem final.
He never came home.

01:26.044 --> 01:28.046
Nobody knows where he is.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.926
Andrew, please, try to understand.

01:33.009 --> 01:35.428
How can I when you
haven't given me any information?

01:35.512 --> 01:38.181
-I told you what I can.
-You told me nothing!

01:38.264 --> 01:40.975
That my life is in danger?
What does that mean?

01:41.059 --> 01:43.228
If someone's threatening me,
I deserve to know--

01:43.311 --> 01:45.271
I've tried to explain.
I can't tell you more

01:45.355 --> 01:47.482
without compromising
a federal investigation.

01:47.565 --> 01:51.319
I came when the Marshals called
because I know you're upset.

01:51.402 --> 01:54.114
I didn't get to say goodbye to anyone.

01:54.197 --> 01:57.450
My wife suffers from mental illness.
She's in a facility in Bethesda.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.035
I'm finishing my graduate degree.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.745
I'm missing classes, exams.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.705
[Cooper] I'm aware and I'm sorry.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.500
But keeping you safe
is the Bureau's primary concern.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.961
How long do I have to stay here?

02:08.044 --> 02:08.962
I don't know.

02:09.045 --> 02:10.588
We're still investigating.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.632
My hope is we can have
a quick breakthrough.

02:12.715 --> 02:14.092
Get you home very soon.

02:14.175 --> 02:15.260
Not good enough.

02:16.511 --> 02:17.512
I'm not under arrest.

02:17.595 --> 02:19.013
What if I want a lawyer?

02:19.097 --> 02:20.348
What if I just leave?

02:20.849 --> 02:22.267
We won't stop you.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.894
But then we won't be able to protect you.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.813
I'm asking you for more time.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.690
I don't want you to be here

02:28.773 --> 02:31.234
for one second longer than necessary.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.745
How'd it go with Kennison?

02:42.829 --> 02:43.872
Not well.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.748
He's threatening to leave.

02:45.832 --> 02:49.043
-And you think he'll do it?
-He's understandably upset.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.088
I bought time but if I don't
tell him something, he's gonna walk.

02:52.171 --> 02:55.842
Our conversation was consumed
by confusion, anger, fear.

02:55.925 --> 02:57.051
His or yours?

02:57.135 --> 02:58.011
Both.

02:58.803 --> 03:01.014
This whole thing makes me sick,

03:01.097 --> 03:02.849
so please tell me you found something.

03:02.932 --> 03:03.975
You tell me.

03:04.475 --> 03:07.145
Our working theory is that
whoever's blackmailing you

03:07.228 --> 03:08.855
is a New York City detective.

03:08.938 --> 03:11.816
That's about 5200 suspects to start with.

03:11.900 --> 03:16.696
Of those, about 2600 are white males,
which is how the bartender described him.

03:16.779 --> 03:19.115
How many were working the night
Doug was killed?

03:19.198 --> 03:21.826
1400. Which leaves
about 1200 names on that list.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.828
Now, it's a lot.

03:23.912 --> 03:28.750
But odds are one of the names
on that list is behind this.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.336
I'll take a look.
Maybe I'll recognize one.

03:31.419 --> 03:35.256
But if there's an NYPD detective
willing to frame me for murder...

03:35.965 --> 03:37.342
I have no idea why.

03:37.425 --> 03:38.676
-Hmm.
-[cell phone ringing]

03:42.055 --> 03:43.890
Got Weecha's text. Said you have a case.

03:43.973 --> 03:45.308
-I do.
<i>-Fine.</i>

03:45.391 --> 03:47.769
<i>-Tell me where. I'll come meet you.</i>
-Not this time.

03:47.852 --> 03:51.272
-Assemble the troops. I'll come to you.
-Does that mean you found something?

03:51.356 --> 03:52.565
[call drops]

03:53.942 --> 03:56.653
[Raymond] You all know
we've been tracing the origins

03:56.736 --> 03:59.572
of this device
we recovered from Elizabeth.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.449
Have you figured out who made it?

04:01.532 --> 04:04.118
I have.
But it's not just a tracking device.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.745
That's one of its features,

04:05.828 --> 04:09.249
but it was designed to help people,
not stalk them.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.292
Who exactly was that thing
supposed to help?

04:11.376 --> 04:12.210
[Raymond] Patients.

04:12.293 --> 04:17.215
In this particular case, those
with certain severe psychiatric disorders.

04:17.298 --> 04:20.385
It's both a delivery
and monitoring system.

04:20.468 --> 04:23.221
Its capsule is loaded with medication,

04:23.304 --> 04:25.974
and as Aram previously discussed,

04:26.057 --> 04:29.185
when it makes contact
with the patient's stomach acid,

04:29.269 --> 04:32.605
it sends a wireless signal
confirming compliance

04:32.689 --> 04:35.275
-and the location of the patient.
-To whom?

04:35.358 --> 04:36.943
Doctors. Loved ones.

04:37.026 --> 04:41.239
Some patients have trouble remembering
if they've taken their medication

04:41.322 --> 04:44.325
or even where they are
or where they might be going.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.619
If we're talking
about the most severe disorders,

04:46.703 --> 04:48.663
skipping meds can cause problems.

04:48.746 --> 04:49.914
It can.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.625
And in this case, it did.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.378
-Aram, Weecha sent you a profile.
-Oh.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.131
Sent me an e-mail.

04:58.673 --> 05:01.134
[Raymond] The designer's name
is Andrew Kennison.

05:01.926 --> 05:06.306
Several years ago, his young wife,
over the course of multiple days,

05:06.389 --> 05:10.643
failed to take doses
of the powerful anti-psychotic medications

05:10.727 --> 05:12.395
her doctors had prescribed.

05:12.478 --> 05:15.440
The result was horrific and tragic.

05:15.523 --> 05:18.234
She took the lives
of her sister and her mother

05:18.318 --> 05:20.486
when they came for a holiday visit.

05:20.570 --> 05:21.946
Oh, my God.

05:22.030 --> 05:25.158
Afterward, Andrew Kennison
went back to school.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.909
A graduate program at MIT.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.286
He designed this

05:28.369 --> 05:32.165
hoping that it might prevent
what happened to his wife and family

05:32.248 --> 05:33.791
from ever happening again.

05:33.875 --> 05:34.876
So it wasn't him?

05:34.959 --> 05:38.129
He designed it
but sounds like he had no connection.

05:38.212 --> 05:40.381
I don't know. I can't ask him.

05:40.465 --> 05:43.009
Why not? We can just get him. He's at MIT.

05:43.092 --> 05:43.926
He's missing.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.803
-[Ressler] Since when?
-[Raymond] A few weeks.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.556
He left the library.
Hasn't been seen since.

05:48.639 --> 05:50.933
That's probably not a coincidence.

05:51.017 --> 05:55.229
I agree. Which is why Andrew Kennison
is the next name on the Blacklist.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.899
-[Ressler] There's a chance he's dead.
-[Raymond] A good one.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.692
All we know is someone took him,

05:59.776 --> 06:02.487
someone who didn't want him found,
and we need to know why.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.030
So where do we start?

06:04.113 --> 06:07.325
His roommate reported him missing
to the campus police.

06:07.408 --> 06:10.286
They've been investigating.
I'd start there.

06:11.412 --> 06:12.580
Harold?

06:12.663 --> 06:13.956
What?

06:14.040 --> 06:15.583
-You okay with that?
-Yeah.

06:15.666 --> 06:18.127
I mean, yes, of course.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.464
Agent Ressler, Agent Zuma,
head up to Boston right away.

06:25.259 --> 06:26.302
Harold.

06:27.136 --> 06:29.847
I want you to know. I realize...

06:30.765 --> 06:33.392
how difficult all this must be for you.

06:33.476 --> 06:34.769
-You do?
-Of course.

06:34.852 --> 06:37.647
I know how much you loved Elizabeth.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.816
How hard it's been to move forward.

06:40.566 --> 06:44.070
When I came back, I knew what it meant
to go down this road.

06:44.153 --> 06:47.115
I knew what searching
for the truth might do to me.

06:47.615 --> 06:49.742
But I was so focused on my own need,

06:49.826 --> 06:53.162
I didn't think enough
about what it might do to you.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.914
You're apologizing? To me?

06:54.997 --> 06:57.416
Commiserating, really.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.210
We all want the same thing.

06:59.293 --> 07:01.504
Closure. Accountability.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.924
And I'm confident
that we will find whoever did this.

07:05.007 --> 07:08.219
And when we do,
they will be the one who is sorry.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.110
Agents Ressler and Zuma?

07:24.193 --> 07:27.071
Ted Morrison, I'm the officer assigned
to the Kennison case.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.531
Thank you for meeting with us.

07:28.614 --> 07:29.532
You kidding?

07:29.615 --> 07:31.909
I've been trying
to get ahold of the Bureau.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.744
Thank you for sharing info.

07:33.828 --> 07:36.539
[Ressler] I'm not sure we follow.
We're not here to share information.

07:36.622 --> 07:39.417
We were hoping you could update us.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.334
Update you?

07:41.210 --> 07:43.421
Is this some kind of joke?

07:43.504 --> 07:45.923
Nobody's joking. We're here to help.

07:46.007 --> 07:51.345
Okay, well, these are surveillance images
from outside the campus library.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.931
Andrew Kennison finished studying
at 10:00 p.m.

07:54.015 --> 07:57.059
When he exited,
he was confronted by an unknown man.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.728
They spoke for a few minutes,

07:58.811 --> 08:01.272
then they got into that sedan and left.

08:01.355 --> 08:02.648
You run the plates?

08:02.732 --> 08:03.816
The first day.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.486
And guess what? It's a federal vehicle.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.404
Registered to the U.S. Marshals Service.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.824
I've been calling them and the FBI
for weeks to ask what I'm dealing with.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.702
No one's gotten back.
Bureaucracy at its finest.

08:14.785 --> 08:16.037
[Morrison] Now that you're here,

08:16.120 --> 08:19.373
I'm thinking the right hand
doesn't know what the left hand is doing.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.459
Who the hell is that?

08:22.168 --> 08:23.294
You're not hearing me.

08:23.377 --> 08:25.296
I'm saying it's all connected.

08:25.379 --> 08:26.547
I'm trying to understand.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.799
Whoever killed Doug and is blackmailing me

08:28.883 --> 08:31.427
also wanted Kennison to disappear. Why?

08:31.511 --> 08:34.639
<i>Kennison created the device</i>
<i>we found in Elizabeth.</i>

08:34.722 --> 08:36.974
He must have info on who's responsible,

08:37.058 --> 08:38.976
<i>details the killer</i>
<i>didn't want us to learn.</i>

08:39.060 --> 08:39.894
Slow down.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.312
I didn't see it.

08:41.812 --> 08:44.899
Whoever targeted me
also targeted Elizabeth Keen.

08:44.982 --> 08:45.816
And I helped him.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.236
I disappeared a witness
who could help us find

08:48.319 --> 08:50.571
the person who orchestrated her death.

08:50.655 --> 08:51.948
Take a breath.

08:52.031 --> 08:52.865
<i>Listen to me.</i>

08:52.949 --> 08:54.492
<i>If you tell the truth now,</i>

08:54.575 --> 08:57.995
there is a good chance
that both of us are going to prison.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.373
<i>Harold.</i>

09:01.999 --> 09:02.917
Harold!

09:04.502 --> 09:05.503
<i>Harold!</i>

09:09.549 --> 09:11.384
[Gwynn] Sorry. What's the question?

09:11.467 --> 09:13.970
The vehicle.
It's registered to the Marshals Service.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.221
It's one of ours.

09:15.304 --> 09:16.264
There a problem?

09:16.347 --> 09:18.558
We're with a specialized Bureau task force

09:18.641 --> 09:21.060
and we're looking for Andrew Kennison.

09:21.143 --> 09:24.730
According to these photos,
he was last seen getting into this vehicle

09:24.814 --> 09:26.148
on the night he disappeared.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.066
Of course.

09:27.149 --> 09:28.651
Of course?

09:28.734 --> 09:30.778
Does that mean he's in custody?

09:30.861 --> 09:31.696
We checked.

09:31.779 --> 09:34.490
He has no criminal record.
He's not a fugitive.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.117
Not sure what's happening.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.620
Kennison's in our custody
because the Bureau requested it.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.248
He's not a suspect.
He's a potential victim.

09:42.331 --> 09:44.750
Are you saying
he's in the Witness Protection Program?

09:44.834 --> 09:46.460
Yeah, his life's in danger.

09:46.544 --> 09:49.672
-[Dembe] What makes you think that?
-The Bureau made the assessment.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.716
We're not in the business
of second guessing

09:51.799 --> 09:53.843
an assistant director of the FBI.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.306
You're gonna have to repeat that.

09:58.389 --> 10:00.016
You should talk to Harold Cooper.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.601
He arranged for the protection.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.102
That's not possible.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.103
[Gwynn] That's a fact.

10:04.186 --> 10:06.022
He supervised the transport.

10:06.105 --> 10:09.358
He met with Kennison yesterday
in one of our safehouses.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.446
[Aram] You're saying--?

10:13.529 --> 10:16.616
Wait, what exactly are you saying?

10:16.699 --> 10:19.035
Kennison's in Witness Protection.
Cooper ordered it.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.119
That's him.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.121
I don't understand. Why?

10:22.204 --> 10:24.624
[Dembe] Same reason you put anyone in.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.000
You don't want them found.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.877
-Found by us?
-[Dembe] Yes.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.128
And Raymond.

10:29.211 --> 10:31.213
You can't be serious.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.256
This isn't happening.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.259
It's hard to believe,
but I don't see any way around the facts.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.969
[Ressler] Let's go back to the beginning.

10:37.053 --> 10:37.887
What do we know?

10:37.970 --> 10:40.181
One, we think someone
orchestrated Keen's death.

10:40.264 --> 10:42.642
Someone who knew Vandyke would kill her

10:42.725 --> 10:44.185
and used him to get the job done

10:44.268 --> 10:46.062
-without exposing himself.
-Or herself.

10:46.145 --> 10:50.524
Two, Kennison may have information
that could lead us to the real killer,

10:50.608 --> 10:54.111
and now we learn that Cooper
made sure Kennison disappeared.

10:54.195 --> 10:57.031
Because he didn't want us
to find out who killed Liz?

10:57.114 --> 10:58.991
We need to take emotion out.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.160
-I cannot do this.
-[Park] We can't ignore the truth.

11:01.243 --> 11:02.870
Cooper knew where Kennison was.

11:02.953 --> 11:06.415
Yet he stood there while
Reddington put his name on the Blacklist.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.084
He sent us to Boston.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.211
He intentionally hid the truth.

11:10.294 --> 11:13.089
There has to be an explanation.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.048
Look at the timing!

11:14.131 --> 11:15.925
He put Kennison in the program

11:16.008 --> 11:18.302
long before Mr. Reddington
knew who to look for.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.304
He did it after we found the device.

11:20.388 --> 11:23.182
Because he knew once we did,
we'd go looking.

11:23.265 --> 11:24.141
So what?

11:24.225 --> 11:26.143
Mr. Cooper wanted Liz dead?

11:27.061 --> 11:27.895
Say it.

11:31.273 --> 11:33.901
Be clear about what you are suggesting.

11:34.610 --> 11:36.821
Mr. Cooper was working
with whoever killed Liz,

11:36.904 --> 11:41.200
and now he's protecting whoever did it
by lying to our faces?

11:41.283 --> 11:43.452
We're just looking at the facts.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.914
My question is, what do we do?
Go to Reddington?

11:46.997 --> 11:50.084
If Cooper's involved,
who do we tell? Panabaker?

11:50.167 --> 11:53.379
We could work the case ourselves.
Confirm if it's true.

11:53.462 --> 11:56.048
[Aram]
You mean set a trap? For Mr. Cooper?

11:56.132 --> 11:57.383
No, I'm not doing it.

11:57.466 --> 11:59.260
We are not doing it.

11:59.343 --> 12:01.387
There has to be an explanation,

12:01.470 --> 12:04.640
and I'm going to go up there
and ask him what it is.

12:04.723 --> 12:07.435
If he knows we're onto him,
it's gonna be a lot harder.

12:07.518 --> 12:08.769
[Aram] I don't care.

12:08.853 --> 12:13.023
I'm not targeting Mr. Cooper
behind his back.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.903
You know what? Aram's right.
We all love the guy.

12:17.987 --> 12:21.073
And God knows
he deserves every benefit of the doubt.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.663
I should've told you.

12:28.622 --> 12:31.083
I'm not entirely sure why I didn't.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.251
I obstructed justice,

12:32.334 --> 12:34.879
tampered with evidence,
lied to the police--

12:34.962 --> 12:37.423
Those may be the least of your concerns.

12:37.506 --> 12:39.341
It's no defense, but I want you to know,

12:39.425 --> 12:42.011
when I decided to put Kennison
into Witness Protection,

12:42.094 --> 12:44.680
I had no idea he had any connection
to Elizabeth's death.

12:44.763 --> 12:46.765
You run the Reddington task force,

12:46.849 --> 12:50.186
and it never occurred to you
that you were being targeted

12:50.269 --> 12:52.229
because of your connection to me?

12:52.313 --> 12:53.481
Not at first.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.317
I didn't know I was targeted at all.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.611
Koster, my wife's ex-lover, was dead.

12:58.694 --> 13:01.322
I had no memory
of what happened that night.

13:01.405 --> 13:04.033
For a time,
I honestly believed I killed him.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.910
You didn't think I could help?

13:05.993 --> 13:07.286
I was frozen.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.580
I could barely admit it to myself.

13:09.663 --> 13:11.790
But it wasn't the truth, Harold.

13:11.874 --> 13:15.127
The minute you realized
you were being blackmailed,

13:15.211 --> 13:17.755
I should've been your first call.

13:17.838 --> 13:19.298
It wasn't that simple.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.133
By then, I'd gotten Charlene involved.

13:21.217 --> 13:24.470
She lied to the detective.
My good friend Lew Sloan

13:24.553 --> 13:27.014
had risked everything
by altering my service weapon.

13:27.097 --> 13:28.682
We're done here.

13:28.766 --> 13:32.269
I told you the day I agreed to come back

13:32.353 --> 13:35.606
that whoever killed Elizabeth
would be held accountable.

13:35.689 --> 13:38.567
-And I want that too.
-Tell me where Kennison is.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.361
Where can I find him?

13:40.444 --> 13:42.488
He's at a safehouse guarded by Marshals.

13:42.571 --> 13:43.489
Where?

13:44.073 --> 13:45.366
I won't tell you.

13:45.449 --> 13:48.327
I'll have the Marshals bring him in.
We'll question him here.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.871
My sources run deep, Harold.

13:51.664 --> 13:55.793
With or without you, I'll have
his location by the end of the day.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.002
Won't help you hurt him.

13:57.086 --> 14:01.006
Whether I hurt him or not
has nothing to do with your help.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.509
And I'm sorry to say, Harold,

14:03.592 --> 14:06.971
you're the one who needs help right now.

14:18.774 --> 14:19.859
It was you.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.452
I understand.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.455
There's no defense.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.708
I should've trusted you.

14:35.791 --> 14:39.628
Told you everything the day I woke up
and realized Doug was dead.

14:39.712 --> 14:43.007
So this whole time, you've been
investigating who killed him on your own?

14:43.090 --> 14:46.719
Not just Koster, but the bartender
who spiked my drink that night.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.388
I wasn't entirely alone.

14:49.471 --> 14:50.723
Lew's been with me.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.224
I'm still trying to understand.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.643
Someone framed you for Koster's murder?

14:54.727 --> 14:55.686
Yes.

14:55.769 --> 14:57.062
It could've worked.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.899
I woke up in my car with no alibi.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.109
Your gun was a match for the bullet.

15:02.192 --> 15:05.571
So whoever had you drugged
must've used it to kill Koster.

15:05.654 --> 15:07.156
Knowing the police would find it.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.450
They would've,
if Lew hadn't altered the barrel.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.160
Why would somebody do this?

15:11.243 --> 15:14.580
At first, I thought it was just to get me.
But now we know it was more.

15:14.663 --> 15:17.917
Whoever's blackmailing me
is also connected to Elizabeth's murder.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.712
I think the original plan was to frame me
as a way to hurt Reddington

15:21.795 --> 15:25.215
by damaging one of his
most powerful weapons, this task force.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.676
So whoever's behind this knows we exist.

15:27.760 --> 15:31.430
And when framing me didn't work,
the plan changed to blackmail.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.892
To leverage me as a way
to stay one step ahead of Reddington.

15:34.975 --> 15:37.603
By using you to do things
like hide Kennison.

15:37.686 --> 15:39.063
[Aram] So Reddington's right.

15:39.146 --> 15:43.442
Vandyke pulled the trigger that killed Liz
but someone else is behind it.

15:43.525 --> 15:44.818
So, what now?

15:44.902 --> 15:47.154
[Cooper]
I face the consequences of my actions.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.324
I've called Panabaker. She's on her way.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.912
I've had some low moments
these last few months.

15:55.579 --> 15:58.374
Maybe the worst
was asking Charlene to lie.

15:58.457 --> 16:02.419
The idea that I involved her in this
is almost more than I can bear.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.506
But lying to you all...

16:08.175 --> 16:10.594
whatever happens to me now, I deserve it.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.567
How do you feel?

16:25.651 --> 16:26.610
How do I feel?

16:27.236 --> 16:29.697
I feel a sense of inevitability.

16:31.407 --> 16:34.326
That it doesn't matter what I want or do.

16:35.285 --> 16:37.037
The world is what it is.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.042
The loss is permanent.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.170
Elizabeth will always be dead.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.631
What do I feel?

16:48.716 --> 16:52.052
I'm concerned
that I won't be able to contain myself.

16:53.429 --> 16:58.017
That I still haven't seen
the worst of who I am.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.021
No, I don't think you have.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.481
[suspenseful music playing]

17:17.202 --> 17:19.121
When do I get to choose?

17:19.204 --> 17:20.664
-Never.
-[Kennison] Never?

17:21.165 --> 17:23.083
You guys are guarding me. How's that fair?

17:23.167 --> 17:26.003
Government's paying,
so we choose the restaurant.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.765
[all shouting]

17:37.848 --> 17:39.892
[suspenseful music playing]

17:58.577 --> 17:59.828
Let go of me.

18:01.622 --> 18:02.831
What is happening?

18:07.294 --> 18:08.629
Who are you? What--?

18:11.006 --> 18:12.925
Remember why we are here.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.601
-I think that's just about everything.
-You think?

18:22.684 --> 18:24.478
You knew your weapon had been fired.

18:24.561 --> 18:27.481
And because you ran
your own ballistics test,

18:27.564 --> 18:29.817
-you knew it was a match?
-Yes.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.527
You lied to the detective.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.196
You actively concealed the match
by altering the gun.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.657
-No. It was my friend who did that.
-Uh-huh.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.575
Did you turn him in?

18:38.659 --> 18:40.410
No. He's aware we're talking.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.870
And so is Charlene.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.373
I convinced her to provide an alibi.

18:44.456 --> 18:47.751
Asking her to lie for me
is my greatest regret.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.129
What about the bartender?

18:50.212 --> 18:52.589
Went to his home, found him murdered.

18:52.673 --> 18:55.592
But you never told the police
what you knew?

18:55.676 --> 18:57.594
-Correct.
-Kennison? Where is he?

18:57.678 --> 18:59.179
The Marshals have him.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.682
You should know
Reddington's looking for him.

19:01.765 --> 19:05.561
I assume whoever's blackmailing me
was also behind Keen's death.

19:05.644 --> 19:08.063
They want Kennison gone.
He knows something.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.984
-We should bring him in--
-We won't be doing anything.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.902
You went too far.

19:13.986 --> 19:18.282
I can sell looking the other way
when Reddington crosses the line.

19:18.365 --> 19:21.160
Hell, we let Dembe Zuma join the Bureau.

19:21.243 --> 19:25.706
There's a lot of stretch where this
task force is concerned, but you?

19:25.789 --> 19:29.376
Obstruction, tampering,
corruption, kidnapping?

19:29.459 --> 19:31.712
Or at the very least
unlawful imprisonment?

19:31.795 --> 19:33.172
[phone rings]

19:33.255 --> 19:35.132
Excuse me, Cynthia.

19:35.883 --> 19:36.967
This is Cooper.

19:39.595 --> 19:40.429
When?

19:41.722 --> 19:43.765
I told you there was a credible threat.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.767
Were any of the Marshals hurt?

19:45.851 --> 19:46.727
I see.

19:46.810 --> 19:49.438
Thanks. My people will get right on it.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.815
That was the Marshals Service.

19:51.899 --> 19:53.817
Kennison was taken.

19:53.901 --> 19:54.860
By Reddington?

19:54.943 --> 19:55.777
Who else?

19:55.861 --> 19:57.571
Jeez Louise.

19:57.654 --> 20:00.032
So much for Witness Protection.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.627
Do you know who I am?

20:11.710 --> 20:12.961
No. I don't.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.838
My name is Raymond Reddington.

20:15.339 --> 20:17.674
I'm a criminal and a fugitive.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.927
I'm wanted in every country on earth

20:20.010 --> 20:23.430
and at the top
of the FBI's Most Wanted List.

20:23.513 --> 20:25.015
I'm armed

20:25.098 --> 20:26.433
and I'm dangerous.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.062
And the most important person
in the world to me

20:30.145 --> 20:33.232
is dead because of you.

20:34.858 --> 20:37.778
Because of your little device.

20:39.321 --> 20:40.781
Do you recognize it?

20:40.864 --> 20:42.157
Hmm.

20:42.241 --> 20:46.245
It was recovered from a former FBI agent
named Elizabeth Keen.

20:47.162 --> 20:48.330
I don't know who that is.

20:48.413 --> 20:49.248
Perhaps not.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.124
But you do know something.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.335
Someone wanted you hidden...

20:54.211 --> 20:56.922
so that I wouldn't discover what that is.

20:57.506 --> 20:58.548
You designed this?

20:59.174 --> 21:02.010
Yes. It's a medication monitor and track--

21:02.094 --> 21:04.471
I'm past what it is and what it does.

21:04.554 --> 21:07.975
It clearly wasn't made
in a manufacturing plant.

21:08.058 --> 21:09.559
No. It's a prototype.

21:10.769 --> 21:14.064
My wife suffers from mental illness.
I designed it for people like her.

21:14.147 --> 21:18.694
You gave it to someone who used it
to track and murder Elizabeth Keen.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.946
-Murder?
-Tell me who.

21:21.029 --> 21:23.615
You've got it wrong. I gave that to a cop.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.742
A police officer?

21:25.826 --> 21:27.995
Yeah. I met him at a business forum,

21:28.078 --> 21:30.122
where people who are
trying to start companies

21:30.205 --> 21:33.375
set up booths to discuss concepts.
I was trying to find investors.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.378
You were supposed to
run a trial at a clinic.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.880
It got canceled.
And I was getting desperate.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.841
And then this guy shows up,

21:40.924 --> 21:44.177
introduces himself
as a detective from New York City.

21:44.261 --> 21:47.806
He thinks my idea has potential,
but not for medical reasons,

21:48.598 --> 21:49.850
as a tracking device.

21:49.933 --> 21:53.478
He says the NYPD might be interested
in trying it out for a few investigations.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.397
Did he show you identification?

21:55.480 --> 21:57.274
He had a badge and everything.

21:57.357 --> 22:00.110
Reggie Cole. Detective Reginald Cole.

22:00.193 --> 22:02.362
I thought, "Hey, it's not what I want,

22:02.446 --> 22:05.574
but if the cops support my company,
that's something."

22:05.657 --> 22:08.035
-So you gave this to him?
-That was a few years ago.

22:08.118 --> 22:11.788
I didn't hear from him,
so I figured the top brass didn't bite.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.250
That's the God's honest truth.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.837
If it is, you'll be in class
by this time tomorrow.

22:19.671 --> 22:20.797
If it's not...

22:22.090 --> 22:23.050
you won't.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.390
Guys, I think I have got something.

22:30.474 --> 22:34.561
I mean, I am pretty sure
I've got something, unless I don't.

22:34.644 --> 22:36.646
But I do.

22:36.730 --> 22:41.151
So the best way we can help Mr. Cooper now
is to find whoever targeted him.

22:41.234 --> 22:43.737
It doesn't change the crimes he committed,

22:43.820 --> 22:46.031
-but that's the idea.
-[Aram] Check this out.

22:46.114 --> 22:49.076
Mr. Cooper recorded his last
conversation with the blackmailer

22:49.159 --> 22:52.079
and sent it to me.
I have been listening non-stop.

22:52.162 --> 22:55.207
-I thought the voice was altered?
-It was, but I listened anyway

22:55.290 --> 22:59.795
for something weird about the word choice
or a train sound in the background.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.671
-You heard something?
-Nothing.

23:01.755 --> 23:05.258
But listening over and over again
did give me another idea.

23:05.342 --> 23:08.553
A voice modification program
is just modifying a voice.

23:08.637 --> 23:11.264
It is an algorithm
that changes key variables

23:11.348 --> 23:13.809
like pitch, tone, speed, distortion.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.143
I understood that.

23:15.227 --> 23:18.522
So I am thinking,
why can't I invert those changes?

23:18.605 --> 23:21.233
If you knew what changes were made,
you could reverse them

23:21.316 --> 23:23.527
and get back to the original voice.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.737
But you can't know
the changes that were made.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.823
You mean, I can't know for sure.

23:27.906 --> 23:30.826
Fortunately, this isn't my first rodeo.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.870
I've never actually been to a rodeo,

23:33.954 --> 23:37.040
so if I ever go,
it will be my first rodeo.

23:37.124 --> 23:42.045
But fortunately, this isn't my first time
examining Fourier series and transforms.

23:42.129 --> 23:43.463
And I'm lost.

23:43.547 --> 23:46.550
Point is, I can't know
what modifications were made,

23:46.633 --> 23:49.594
but I can make a series
of educated guesses.

23:49.678 --> 23:53.807
And I know the best software out there
and how I would sweeten the mix.

23:53.890 --> 23:55.517
Here, listen.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.227
[man on recording] <i>Andrew Kennison.</i>

23:57.310 --> 23:59.980
<i>Well, I need him to go away.</i>

24:00.063 --> 24:03.233
<i>Andrew Kennison.</i>
<i>Well, I need him to go away.</i>

24:03.316 --> 24:05.193
<i>Andrew Kennison. Well, I need him to--</i>

24:05.277 --> 24:07.237
So I have six different versions.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.114
I can't know if any are right,

24:09.197 --> 24:11.700
but I reversed the process
a little differently on each.

24:11.783 --> 24:15.203
One of these recordings
is the actual voice, but which one?

24:15.287 --> 24:18.290
Cooper thinks the blackmailer
is a detective from New York.

24:18.373 --> 24:20.542
We could send all
to the Chief of Detectives.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.127
Maybe one sounds familiar.

24:22.210 --> 24:23.420
[footsteps approaching]

24:25.630 --> 24:26.965
Agent Ressler,

24:27.465 --> 24:29.968
please place Director Cooper under arrest.

24:30.051 --> 24:32.304
He intends to make a full statement.

24:32.387 --> 24:33.680
Not a chance.

24:33.763 --> 24:35.390
It's okay, Donald.

24:35.473 --> 24:37.017
The hell it is.

24:37.100 --> 24:40.937
How many times has Main Justice looked
the other way for Reddington or even Keen?

24:41.021 --> 24:43.940
-This is your turn.
-That's not up for discussion.

24:44.024 --> 24:47.527
I will do my best to argue
for leniency, believe that.

24:47.611 --> 24:50.822
What if we walk?
There is no task force without Mr. Cooper.

24:50.906 --> 24:52.866
That would be a mistake.

24:52.949 --> 24:55.076
There's still important work to do.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.828
I want justice

24:56.912 --> 25:01.249
for what was done to me
and, more importantly, for Elizabeth.

25:02.792 --> 25:06.046
The four of you are
the best chance we've got to get it.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.643
Harold Cooper,
you have the right to remain silent.

25:19.726 --> 25:23.021
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

25:23.104 --> 25:24.689
You have the right to an attorney.

25:24.773 --> 25:27.901
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you.

25:27.984 --> 25:30.403
Do you understand these rights
as I've explained them?

25:30.487 --> 25:31.446
Yes.

25:31.529 --> 25:34.491
And with these rights in mind,
do you wish to make a statement?

25:43.792 --> 25:46.753
[Marvin]
<i>Obstruction, falsifying documents,</i>

25:46.836 --> 25:48.630
<i>tampering with physical evidence,</i>

25:48.713 --> 25:50.924
misappropriating federal funds.

25:51.007 --> 25:53.885
Oh, and I haven't even gotten
to the charges of

25:53.969 --> 25:56.596
depriving Andrew Kennison of his liberty.

25:56.680 --> 25:57.931
I know what he did, Marvin.

25:58.014 --> 26:00.725
What I'm asking is how
we make sure a jury never does.

26:00.809 --> 26:03.561
Oh, Cooper's case isn't going to a jury.

26:03.645 --> 26:07.190
He'll plead guilty and pray
he gets a favorable sentence.

26:07.274 --> 26:08.358
It can't come to that.

26:08.441 --> 26:11.403
Go to the Post Office.
Harold's there, talk to him.

26:11.486 --> 26:13.071
You want me to defend him?

26:13.154 --> 26:16.324
He can't go to prison,
for his sake or for Agnes'.

26:16.950 --> 26:19.869
You're the boss.
I just have this one appointment,

26:19.953 --> 26:22.747
then I can cancel the rest of
my afternoon and meet you there.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.332
Actually, I've got plans.

26:24.416 --> 26:28.753
I spoke with the man who designed
that device we recovered from Elizabeth.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.630
Good news. What'd he say?

26:30.714 --> 26:33.258
Enough. I know who I'm looking for
and where to find him.

26:33.341 --> 26:36.469
I'll take care of business,
you take care of Harold.

26:38.513 --> 26:40.307
Okay, guys, let's do this.

26:44.477 --> 26:45.603
[recorder beeps]

26:49.024 --> 26:50.734
You really wanna do this?

26:50.817 --> 26:52.360
Make a full confession?

26:53.403 --> 26:55.530
Strange how things happen, isn't it?

26:56.573 --> 26:58.658
I wouldn't let Reddington see Agnes

26:58.742 --> 27:01.828
because I thought
I should protect her from him.

27:01.911 --> 27:05.540
She finally had a good home,
a stable family.

27:06.291 --> 27:09.044
-And now I'm the one who--
-You could fight it.

27:09.127 --> 27:12.672
Force the U.S. Attorney to make
their case beyond a reasonable doubt.

27:13.423 --> 27:14.549
You know I won't.

27:16.176 --> 27:19.846
I've spent my life holding others
accountable for their crimes.

27:21.181 --> 27:22.307
I'm glad it's you.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.477
Let's get it over with.

27:26.686 --> 27:28.313
That's gonna have to wait.

27:28.396 --> 27:30.482
Sorry, not sorry to interrupt.

27:30.565 --> 27:33.693
But we have got a suspect,
and Mr. Cooper was right.

27:33.777 --> 27:34.611
Almost.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.698
The person blackmailing you
was a New York City detective.

27:40.033 --> 27:40.867
Was?

27:47.457 --> 27:50.418
We just heard from the office of
the New York Chief of Detectives.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.921
A precinct captain in Brooklyn recognized

27:53.004 --> 27:55.882
one of the voices we sent
as a Reginald Cole.

27:55.965 --> 28:00.136
Reggie spent 25 years in the NYPD,
17 as a Brooklyn detective.

28:00.220 --> 28:02.430
-He's retired?
-I thought so at first.

28:02.514 --> 28:05.266
But I took a closer look.
At the time he left,

28:05.350 --> 28:08.603
Cole was the subject of
multiple IAB investigations.

28:08.686 --> 28:11.606
A grand jury
was deliberating on an indictment

28:11.689 --> 28:13.817
for multiple counts
of official corruption,

28:13.900 --> 28:16.152
drug money seized and unaccounted for,

28:16.236 --> 28:19.155
allegations of excessive force,
witness intimidation.

28:19.239 --> 28:21.866
In the end, the cases
against him fell apart.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.910
A key witness was found murdered.

28:23.993 --> 28:27.288
We're dealing with somebody
with a malfunctioning ethical compass.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.416
[Aram] When he left the department,
he left New York.

28:29.499 --> 28:32.335
Now, he works in D.C.
as a private investigator,

28:32.419 --> 28:36.297
and his website says
he handles highly sensitive matters,

28:36.381 --> 28:38.758
both personal and professional.

28:39.592 --> 28:42.971
What do you have? I'm in a rush.
My campaign won't wait.

28:43.054 --> 28:44.764
[Cole] Yeah, I know you're busy.

28:44.848 --> 28:48.059
But you hired me to find quality dirt,
the kind that ends careers,

28:48.143 --> 28:50.979
so I thought you might
wanna see this right away.

28:51.062 --> 28:54.107
You did it? What did he do? Infidelity?

28:54.190 --> 28:58.027
Oh, please, let it be a sex scandal,
that pious son of a bitch.

28:58.778 --> 29:00.321
[Aram] <i>He has an office in Logan Circle.</i>

29:00.405 --> 29:03.158
I ghost-called him minutes ago,
he picked up.

29:03.241 --> 29:05.910
If we roll out now, we can be there in 15.

29:06.411 --> 29:08.663
Oh, my God. How did you get this?

29:09.456 --> 29:11.124
-Does it matter?
-Matter?

29:11.207 --> 29:16.004
I hired you to do oppo research,
to get damaging intel on my opponent.

29:16.087 --> 29:18.923
I tried, but turns out,
he's squeaky clean.

29:19.007 --> 29:21.259
You, on the other hand, not so much.

29:21.342 --> 29:23.928
You've been
misappropriating campaign funds. Oof.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.972
[clicking tongue] Bad congresswoman.

29:26.264 --> 29:27.682
I don't get it. Who's this guy?

29:27.766 --> 29:30.643
Why would a shady former detective
be connected to killing Keen?

29:30.727 --> 29:33.563
We're about to find out.
Let's pull a warrant and bring him in.

29:34.314 --> 29:35.315
What do you want?

29:35.398 --> 29:39.694
I'm a simple guy, Ms. Newton.
A hundred thousand should be good for now.

29:40.195 --> 29:42.572
You're shaking me down? I'm your client.

29:42.655 --> 29:45.950
I know. A thing of beauty, isn't it?
This way, you get to pay me twice,

29:46.034 --> 29:49.579
to check out your opponent
and to keep my mouth shut.

29:51.581 --> 29:53.041
You have 24 hours, Di.

29:53.708 --> 29:55.043
See you tomorrow.

29:57.921 --> 29:59.047
[cell phone rings]

30:00.924 --> 30:02.133
Yeah?

30:03.218 --> 30:04.093
What?

30:04.803 --> 30:06.805
Okay, okay.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.181
[dramatic music playing]

30:40.839 --> 30:42.715
[suspenseful music playing]

30:54.310 --> 30:56.521
Get outside, see if you can find him.

31:02.735 --> 31:03.695
Damn it.

31:07.782 --> 31:08.658
Still hot.

31:12.078 --> 31:14.497
[intense music playing]

31:26.050 --> 31:27.844
I've got eyes. He's a runner.

31:30.013 --> 31:32.849
So Cole's retired
but he still has his shield?

31:32.932 --> 31:34.517
[Park] Every department is different.

31:34.601 --> 31:37.562
NYPD makes you turn it in,
but they don't always enforce the rule.

31:37.645 --> 31:38.897
Maybe it's a replica.

31:38.980 --> 31:42.066
People don't realize,
but a lot of cops carry dupe shields

31:42.150 --> 31:44.652
so they don't risk losing the real thing.

31:45.361 --> 31:47.030
What, are you seeing this?

31:47.947 --> 31:49.157
That's Cole.

31:50.450 --> 31:53.536
FBI! Drop the weapon! On the ground.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.705
-Federal agents!
-Okay, it's down.

31:55.788 --> 31:56.998
It's down.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.963
I should've known.

32:04.047 --> 32:05.173
Hey, sorry, fellas.

32:05.256 --> 32:06.758
Too little, too late.

32:30.114 --> 32:31.199
[door opens]

32:32.408 --> 32:34.702
[door closes, then footsteps approaching]

32:39.749 --> 32:41.626
I'm okay, Cynthia. Really.

32:42.293 --> 32:44.462
For the first time, I'm hopeful.

32:44.545 --> 32:46.547
-Hopeful?
-We've got a lead.

32:46.631 --> 32:49.050
The man blackmailing me is Reginald Cole,

32:49.133 --> 32:52.095
a private investigator
and a former NYPD detective.

32:52.178 --> 32:53.805
That's good news, Harold.

32:54.764 --> 32:57.642
I'm afraid I'm here
to deliver the opposite.

32:57.725 --> 32:59.310
You spoke to the attorney general.

32:59.394 --> 33:02.397
And he spoke to the president
and the Senate oversight committee.

33:03.231 --> 33:04.983
It's what we were afraid of.

33:05.066 --> 33:07.902
They don't love our arrangement
with Reddington.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.654
Then they're wrong.

33:11.489 --> 33:13.616
We're approaching 200 Blacklisters.

33:13.700 --> 33:16.619
Man has done more
for law enforcement than anyone.

33:16.703 --> 33:18.079
Preaching to the choir.

33:18.162 --> 33:21.416
Remember, I'm the one who went to bat
for reconstituting the task force.

33:21.499 --> 33:22.750
They're not stupid.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.628
They know Reddington
continues to commit crimes.

33:25.712 --> 33:29.132
And Keen's death was an embarrassment.

33:29.215 --> 33:32.176
Proof that things
had gotten way beyond my control.

33:32.260 --> 33:35.680
How do you think we got back here?
I made promises.

33:35.763 --> 33:38.808
I had to assure people
we'd have a very tight leash.

33:38.891 --> 33:41.728
How was I supposed to go back now
and say, "The man in charge,

33:41.811 --> 33:45.231
the assistant director of the FBI,
committed, I don't know,

33:45.314 --> 33:48.735
a dozen felonies, but, hey,
we should look the other way"?

33:50.319 --> 33:52.238
So they want to indict me?

33:54.407 --> 33:55.867
I'm not giving up.

33:55.950 --> 33:59.120
You know how it works.
Law enforcement is politics.

33:59.203 --> 34:02.040
If we can make some cases, big ones,

34:02.123 --> 34:04.834
that expose whatever
conspiracy is going on...

34:04.917 --> 34:07.462

-Barely. Reddington almost beat us there.

-With Ms. Panabaker.

34:29.567 --> 34:30.943

34:32.111 --> 34:35.281
You won't be happy
with the decision on Harold.

34:35.364 --> 34:37.575
-The AG wants to charge him?
-For now.

34:37.658 --> 34:40.328
But if we make a solid case
against whoever is responsible,

34:40.411 --> 34:42.330
we may be able to change that.

34:42.413 --> 34:44.248
-Who's running point?
-I am.

34:44.332 --> 34:46.250
You should know the pressure's on.

34:46.334 --> 34:50.296
It is critically important
that your suspect talks.

34:50.379 --> 34:53.299
If he doesn't,
we may not have enough to hold him.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.429
I need a word.

35:04.352 --> 35:08.147
You're making a mistake.
Agent Ressler is making a mistake.

35:08.231 --> 35:11.526
-He's trying to do what's best for Harold.
-So am I.

35:11.609 --> 35:16.280
And what's best for Harold is to find
the person who orchestrated this insanity.

35:16.364 --> 35:19.826
I'm in a better position
to accomplish that quickly.

35:19.909 --> 35:22.620
There are times
to handle things by the book,

-I care about accountability.

I respect that.
After what we've been through,

I'm hardly the one to get up on a high
horse about the right way to do things.

will be inadmissible in any prosecution.

How did you know this building existed?

There seems to be some misunderstanding.
I'm not here to answer questions.

I'm here to stop you from asking them.
Mr. Cole is my client.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.460
As of this moment,

36:52.543 --> 36:56.214
you are precluded from
questioning him under any circumstances.

36:57.548 --> 37:00.927
I don't know who you are,
but I can tell you this,

37:01.010 --> 37:04.680
you are now squarely
on the Justice Department's radar.

I'd like to see my client now.

37:39.632 --> 37:41.717
[Panabaker] You think it'd be that easy?

37:41.801 --> 37:45.888
Did you think you could just waltz
into a black site and make demands?

37:45.972 --> 37:49.642
-I have a right to see my client.
-And you will. At his arraignment.

37:49.725 --> 37:52.561
Oh, please.
You don't have enough to charge him.

37:52.645 --> 37:54.480
He murdered Doug Koster.

37:54.563 --> 37:58.567
That'd concern me if you had
a shred of evidence proving it was true.

37:58.651 --> 38:02.029
He targeted the assistant director
of the FBI, tried to frame him.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.155

38:03.239 --> 38:06.117
And the bartender he forced
into helping him was also killed.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.201
How sad.

38:07.285 --> 38:10.913
Not that some bartender was killed
but that you can't seem to accept reality.

-That we can prove.

if you accurately reversed the process.

about Agent Keen.

And there it is.

The motive.

I assume you know about the tracking
device recovered from Agent Keen?

38:50.953 --> 38:53.122
I may have heard something, yes.

your client acquired a tracking device

38:56.417 --> 38:58.627
that was used to stalk
and murder our agent?

38:58.711 --> 39:01.213
He bought the tracker. That's not a crime.

39:01.297 --> 39:03.257
You can't prove
he caused Keen to ingest it

39:03.341 --> 39:05.926
and that he had any contact with Vandyke.
