[gull calling]

00:50.833 --> 00:53.040
[breathes deeply]

00:53.041 --> 00:54.708
[contemplative music continues]

00:56.750 --> 00:57.583
[sighs]

01:03.583 --> 01:06.582
[man] <i>So, why do you want to work
for a company like ours, Daisy?</i>

01:06.583 --> 01:10.165
[Helen] <i>Uh, well,
I saw your advert in the paper,</i>

01:10.166 --> 01:13.583
and I saw that you were looking
for a translator, and, um,

01:14.625 --> 01:17.958
I can translate, so... [chuckles softly]

01:18.541 --> 01:20.999
[man] Your CV's a bit patchy.
A couple of big gaps.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.415
Yeah, um, I've been out of the country
for most of the last ten years.

01:24.416 --> 01:26.290
[man] Since you were 18.
Hence the languages.

01:26.291 --> 01:28.500
French, German, and Russian.
That's impressive.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.624
Though we usually ask for candidates
to be educated up to university level.

01:32.625 --> 01:35.375
Although, I note
that you had an offer from Cambridge.

01:37.125 --> 01:38.540
Oh, was... How do you...?

01:38.541 --> 01:40.749
[man] Oh, there are always records
of these things,

01:40.750 --> 01:42.749
as much as one might try and hide them.

01:42.750 --> 01:44.915
You were quite an exceptional student.

01:44.916 --> 01:47.707
I assume that's why
they offered you the scholarship.

01:47.708 --> 01:50.208
Except... you turned it down

01:50.708 --> 01:53.458
in order to leave the country
for ten years.

01:55.250 --> 01:56.666
But I like that.

01:57.458 --> 01:58.665
Shows bravery.

01:58.666 --> 01:59.624
[chuckles softly]

01:59.625 --> 02:02.290
[man] Mother deceased.
Father's whereabouts unknown.

02:02.291 --> 02:04.082
When you were asked
if you had any siblings,

02:04.083 --> 02:05.749
you wrote down that you did not.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.250
What can you tell us
about a woman named Bonnie Weir?

02:11.083 --> 02:11.916
Uh...

02:12.916 --> 02:15.457
She was my, um, stepsister

02:15.458 --> 02:18.583
for, uh... three years
when we were teenagers.

02:19.166 --> 02:21.707
My mother married her father,
but, I mean... [scoffs]

02:21.708 --> 02:24.125
- ...it didn't last long. My mum, she, um--
- Died.

02:26.750 --> 02:29.500
And so... Bon...

02:32.166 --> 02:35.583
Well, Bonnie wasn't my stepsister anymore.
She was just, um...

02:36.625 --> 02:38.415
I... I mean,
I don't know what that's called,

02:38.416 --> 02:39.999
if there's even a name for it.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.374
If you have a stepsister,
and your mother then passes away,

02:43.375 --> 02:45.874
and is no longer married
to your stepsister's father?

02:45.875 --> 02:47.124
Yeah.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.125
It's called having a stepsister still.

02:51.916 --> 02:52.750
Right.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.915
Okay, well, I...
I didn't realize that when I was--

02:55.916 --> 02:57.458
Do you know where Bonnie is now?

03:00.083 --> 03:01.457
HMP Bronzefield.

03:01.458 --> 03:06.500
Serving a life sentence for the murder
of her biological father, your stepfather.

03:07.791 --> 03:09.875
Maybe you aren't stepsisters anymore, actually.

03:10.458 --> 03:13.540
She's about nine and a half years
into her sentence, isn't she?

03:13.541 --> 03:17.332
She was sent down just before
you left the country in such a hurry.

03:17.333 --> 03:19.125
[quiet somber music plays]

03:21.000 --> 03:21.875
[smacks lips]

03:22.541 --> 03:24.583
Daisy, we have a company policy.

03:25.083 --> 03:28.666
We don't hire someone
with these kind of family complications.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.166
[chuckles softly]

03:31.000 --> 03:31.833
Okay.

03:32.375 --> 03:36.040
Uh... thank you for the opportunity,
and I'm sorry for wasting your time.

03:36.041 --> 03:36.957
You didn't.

03:36.958 --> 03:38.375
[somber music continues]

03:40.375 --> 03:42.499
[scribbling]

03:42.500 --> 03:43.541
[paper tears]

03:48.083 --> 03:50.375
When you get home, call this number.

03:51.333 --> 03:53.832
You'll be put through
to a woman named Reed.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.541
Tell her that I told you to call her.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.833
Tell her that I said
I think I've found one.

03:59.750 --> 04:00.666
Found one what?

04:01.791 --> 04:03.125
A little Black Dove.

04:03.833 --> 04:05.208
[somber music continues]

04:07.833 --> 04:08.875
[paper shuffles]

04:29.375 --> 04:31.500
A little Black Dove.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.416
[somber music continues]

04:41.041 --> 04:42.040
[music fades]

04:42.041 --> 04:43.000
[car door closes]

04:50.666 --> 04:52.500
- [Reed] Evening.
- [Helen] Hi.

04:54.875 --> 04:56.291
Daisy, I presume?

04:57.333 --> 04:58.208
Yes.

04:58.708 --> 05:02.082
[Reed] You applied to be a dogsbody for
an international corporate solutions firm.

05:02.083 --> 05:03.624
[Helen] I applied to be a translator.

05:03.625 --> 05:05.124
And they wouldn't let you

05:05.125 --> 05:07.082
because of your family's
intimate connections

05:07.083 --> 05:08.957
with Her Majesty's Prison Service.

05:08.958 --> 05:10.749
- Yes.
- [Reed] Well, lucky old you.

05:10.750 --> 05:13.665
A door closes,
a window opens, as I always say.

05:13.666 --> 05:16.415
- So you speak French, German, and Russian?
- Yes.

05:16.416 --> 05:19.332
- [Reed] Fluent in all?
- German's a little more conversational.

05:19.333 --> 05:22.457
Oh, yes,
the famously conversational Germans.

05:22.458 --> 05:24.915
Ever tried learning any other languages?

05:24.916 --> 05:27.499
- Like what?
- [Reed] Mandarin, Korean, Farsi?

05:27.500 --> 05:28.750
- Nope.
- [Reed] Why not?

05:29.583 --> 05:30.749
Not a lot of bar work in Iran.

05:30.750 --> 05:33.165
Oh, I've had some of the best nights
of my life there.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.957
To be young in Tehran again...

05:34.958 --> 05:37.165
Are-- Are you looking for a translator?

05:37.166 --> 05:38.125
No.

05:39.916 --> 05:40.749
Ms. Reed.

05:40.750 --> 05:41.708
Mrs. Reed.

05:43.916 --> 05:44.791
Mrs. Reed.

05:46.750 --> 05:49.916
I don't know who you are
or what you do or even where you do it,

05:50.416 --> 05:53.207
but if you are not
looking to hire anyone--

05:53.208 --> 05:54.916
Oh, I'm looking to hire someone.

05:56.083 --> 05:58.625
Just not for the job
you were applying for.

06:00.041 --> 06:02.374
Okay, then what is the job?
Who are the Black Doves?

06:02.375 --> 06:03.790
[quiet suspenseful music plays]

06:03.791 --> 06:05.999
We're procurists. Harvesters.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.582
We deal in the currency of information.
We gather it, and we sell it.

06:09.583 --> 06:10.499
You're spies?

06:10.500 --> 06:11.791
Yes.

06:13.708 --> 06:14.832
For us? For Britain?

06:14.833 --> 06:17.957
We're a capitalist organization,
not an ideological one.

06:17.958 --> 06:20.124
Well, capitalism <i>is</i> an ideology.

06:20.125 --> 06:23.875
Oh, well, there's that Oxbridge degree
you didn't take coming in handy.

06:26.375 --> 06:30.790
So you... you gather information,
and you sell it to...?

06:30.791 --> 06:32.040
The highest bidder.

06:32.041 --> 06:33.957
China? Russia? Iran?

06:33.958 --> 06:35.208
The highest bidder.

06:38.625 --> 06:40.707
- Would I be breaking the law?
- Yes.

06:40.708 --> 06:42.541
- Would I be in danger?
- [Reed] Yes.

06:44.541 --> 06:46.249
Would I be betraying my country?

06:46.250 --> 06:47.874
[Reed] Sometimes, you'll be helping it.

06:47.875 --> 06:48.915
And the other times?

06:48.916 --> 06:52.875
Oh, you'll just be one more little hand
on the roundabout, making it spin.

06:54.333 --> 06:55.207
[chuckles wryly]

06:55.208 --> 06:57.166
[suspenseful music continues]

07:01.458 --> 07:03.915
What makes you think
that I'd want to do something like that?

07:03.916 --> 07:06.749
[Reed] Because you're
a highly intelligent risk-taker.

07:06.750 --> 07:08.207
Because you're a survivor.

07:08.208 --> 07:10.082
Because something happened
with your stepfather

07:10.083 --> 07:11.874
and you managed
to disappear for ten years.

07:11.875 --> 07:14.707
And because when most people look at you,
they see a beautiful woman.

07:14.708 --> 07:15.625
But me,

07:16.250 --> 07:17.624
I see a coiled spring.

07:17.625 --> 07:18.750
I see a weapon.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.957
You sized me up
the minute I walked up to you.

07:22.958 --> 07:24.790
You've got an escape strategy
in your head.

07:24.791 --> 07:26.040
You know where the exits are.

07:26.041 --> 07:28.207
You know I'm not wearing shoes
I can run in.

07:28.208 --> 07:30.540
I bet you remember my car number plate.

07:30.541 --> 07:33.333
G174 SAP.

07:35.833 --> 07:38.457
Don't think I don't know
you've got your hand balled up into a fist

07:38.458 --> 07:40.583
in your pocket,
ready to swing it, young lady.

07:41.083 --> 07:42.791
Daisy isn't your real name, is it?

07:44.291 --> 07:45.750
How would you like a new one?

07:46.500 --> 07:48.500
[suspenseful music continues]

08:03.375 --> 08:05.250
[Wallace] Our nation's potential is vast.

08:05.750 --> 08:09.708
And it is incumbent upon us
to harness it wisely.

08:10.458 --> 08:14.249
So let us be known for our pragmatism,
our ability to find common ground,

08:14.250 --> 08:20.040
and our dedication to building
a, uh, stronger, more cohesive society.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.125
[suspenseful music continues]

08:22.750 --> 08:23.583
Uh...

08:25.583 --> 08:26.875
Sorry, just, um...

08:27.416 --> 08:31.207
Oh yeah. It is time for us
to be a force for positive change.

08:31.208 --> 08:34.707
To have the determination
to reach ever higher, ever further.

08:34.708 --> 08:38.707
And that is what I will provide
for my constituents, ladies and gentlemen.

08:38.708 --> 08:42.875
And it's what I know that people at home,
everyday people, our voters,

08:43.541 --> 08:45.250
care about the most.

08:46.333 --> 08:48.541
[applause]

08:49.708 --> 08:51.708
[suspenseful music continues]

08:58.250 --> 09:00.333
[Helen] Hi. Tequila on the rocks, please.

09:01.375 --> 09:02.624
It's been a long day.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.083
Yes. Hasn't it?

09:06.458 --> 09:07.708
I saw you speak earlier.

09:08.583 --> 09:09.833
Oh yeah? What did you think?

09:11.583 --> 09:13.166
Think you need to get better at it.

09:14.625 --> 09:15.458
Ouch.

09:15.958 --> 09:16.874
Well, I just...

09:16.875 --> 09:18.624
- [scoffs]
- Sorry. I meant the presentation.

09:18.625 --> 09:21.332
Just sort of eye contact.
You know, engagement.

09:21.333 --> 09:22.708
Get a decent suit.

09:23.958 --> 09:25.665
What's... what's wrong with my suit?

09:25.666 --> 09:28.499
Apart from the fit,
the color, and the material? No, nothing.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.999
- Okay.
- [bartender] Tequila.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.124
- Thank you.
- Okay.

09:31.125 --> 09:34.582
Any thoughts on the, um...
the contents of the speech?

09:34.583 --> 09:36.707
You know, the actual words that I said?

09:36.708 --> 09:40.332
Well, I-- I think nobody's going to listen
to the lovely things you have to say

09:40.333 --> 09:42.332
if you don't work on the presentation.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.374
- Ah, you're a skeptic. Okay.
- Guilty.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.874
- That's fair.
- [Helen] Uh-huh.

09:45.875 --> 09:47.624
But here's the thing. Here's the secret.

09:47.625 --> 09:50.124
- I actually meant what I said. I did.
- [Helen laughs]

09:50.125 --> 09:51.541
- Really?
- Yeah, I did.

09:52.333 --> 09:53.165
You're an idealist.

09:53.166 --> 09:56.750
Well, if you don't have a dream,
how are you gonna have a dream come true?

09:57.416 --> 09:58.999
And a Rodgers and Hammerstein fan.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.207
[both laugh]

10:00.208 --> 10:01.500
Guilty, I'm afraid.

10:03.875 --> 10:04.708
What's your name?

10:08.208 --> 10:10.791
Helen Dawson.
Nice to meet you, Helen Dawson.

10:11.291 --> 10:12.708
Nice to meet you, Wallace Webb.

10:21.458 --> 10:23.666
[breathing softly]

10:25.708 --> 10:26.750
[exhales softly]

10:32.375 --> 10:34.083
[suspenseful music plays]

10:39.750 --> 10:42.125
[laptop whirs]

10:46.208 --> 10:47.166
[computer beeps]

10:49.333 --> 10:51.333
[suspenseful music continues]

10:55.291 --> 10:56.166
[trills]

11:06.000 --> 11:07.208
[music fades]

11:09.875 --> 11:10.749
Here.

11:10.750 --> 11:11.666
Good evening.

11:12.291 --> 11:13.791
- What?
- Good evening.

11:15.541 --> 11:18.374
"How are you? What's your name?
Thank you so much for waiting."

11:18.375 --> 11:20.749
Just some standard conversational gambits

11:20.750 --> 11:23.499
to try when... you know,
when you meet someone for the first time.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.082
Are you being serious right now?

11:25.083 --> 11:26.500
I'm being polite right now.

11:27.625 --> 11:28.707
My name's Sam.

11:28.708 --> 11:30.124
Dais-- Helen.

11:30.125 --> 11:34.499
Yeah, try not to say half of your old name
before introducing yourself.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.540
That's probably Spycraft 101, isn't it?

11:36.541 --> 11:38.957
Who are you? Are you a Black Dove?

11:38.958 --> 11:40.000
[scoffs] No.

11:40.750 --> 11:41.749
No, I'm not a spy.

11:41.750 --> 11:44.082
I do a bit of work for Reed
off-book sometimes.

11:44.083 --> 11:46.416
Great. So you're the odd-job man, then?

11:47.750 --> 11:49.874
That's not the way I would describe it.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.999
Well, no, you'd-- you'd probably make it
sound more important, wouldn't you?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.333
[rain patters gently]

11:59.833 --> 12:01.208
So how was your job tonight?

12:02.500 --> 12:03.332
[Helen exhales]

12:03.333 --> 12:05.958
- Sorry, it's none of my business.
- No, it isn't.

12:07.375 --> 12:08.625
Was he really gross?

12:09.708 --> 12:10.541
No, he was...

12:12.208 --> 12:13.540
he was a gentleman. [scoffs]

12:13.541 --> 12:15.166
- A gentleman?
- Uh-huh.

12:15.708 --> 12:17.374
Okay. [inhales deeply]

12:17.375 --> 12:20.416
- So where am I taking you?
- Oh, just drop me at the station.

12:21.166 --> 12:22.415
Oh shit.

12:22.416 --> 12:24.499
- What?
- Uh, I left something up there.

12:24.500 --> 12:25.957
- What?
- A lighter.

12:25.958 --> 12:28.291
- Buy another one.
- No, I can't. That was my mother's.

12:28.833 --> 12:32.166
Can I give you
a small piece of advice, Dais-- Helen?

12:32.750 --> 12:34.958
Um... don't get sentimental.

12:35.666 --> 12:37.415
Yeah, well, that was very profound.
Thank you.

12:37.416 --> 12:40.665
Um, there's a saying
about returning to the scene of a crime.

12:40.666 --> 12:43.374
I'm trying to remember,
is it a good thing to do or not?

12:43.375 --> 12:45.665
You know, you're being very fucking droll
for 3:00 a.m.

12:45.666 --> 12:47.874
I'm trying to stop you
from doing something stupid.

12:47.875 --> 12:50.082
- A bit fucking late for that, isn't it?
- Okay, listen.

12:50.083 --> 12:53.165
This is what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna wait here.

12:53.166 --> 12:54.749
I can see your room.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.832
If you don't need me,
then draw the curtains.

12:56.833 --> 12:59.999
If the curtains don't close,
then I'll be up in 15 minutes.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.250
And I'll come up hot,
and I'll get you out of there.

13:03.500 --> 13:04.500
This your first job?

13:05.416 --> 13:06.291
Yeah.

13:08.208 --> 13:09.083
You did good.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.666
Thank you.

13:14.625 --> 13:16.333
- [sighs]
- I'll wait here.

13:17.208 --> 13:18.041
Okay?

13:24.125 --> 13:25.458
[knocking on door]

13:29.833 --> 13:30.708
You left.

13:32.083 --> 13:34.083
- Yes.
- [Wallace] Okay.

13:35.833 --> 13:37.249
But now you're back?

13:37.250 --> 13:39.166
[chuckles]

13:40.541 --> 13:41.375
Yes.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.500
- What are you doing?
- [Wallace chuckles]

13:56.583 --> 13:57.500
Working.

13:58.583 --> 14:00.540
- At 3:00 a.m.?
- [Wallace] Uh-huh.

14:00.541 --> 14:02.708
Well, there's a lot to do.

14:04.791 --> 14:06.000
What are you working on?

14:08.166 --> 14:09.041
The future.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.333
- Why did you come back?
- [chuckles softly]

14:16.916 --> 14:18.625
[gentle music plays]

14:45.666 --> 14:46.875
[exhales]

14:48.500 --> 14:50.500
[gentle music continues]

15:03.250 --> 15:04.082
[keys jangle]

15:04.083 --> 15:05.291
[engine starts]

15:16.291 --> 15:17.374
[music fades]

15:17.375 --> 15:18.583
[Sam] That's him.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.583
"Elmore Fitch."
That doesn't sound like a real name.

15:23.291 --> 15:24.790
Former marksman for the SAS.

15:24.791 --> 15:27.124
Forty-five confirmed kills in Afghanistan.

15:27.125 --> 15:30.250
Came back to civilian life in 2015
and went freelance.

15:31.375 --> 15:34.874
- Have you ever come up against him before?
- No, but I've heard things.

15:34.875 --> 15:35.832
Like what?

15:35.833 --> 15:39.165
Like he's a former marksman for the SAS
with 45 confirmed kills in Afghanistan.

15:39.166 --> 15:40.124
That kind of thing.

15:40.125 --> 15:43.625
Why would Jason have been calling
the daughter of the Chinese ambassador?

15:44.125 --> 15:45.125
I've no idea.

15:45.666 --> 15:47.665
But those two hit women in his flat,

15:47.666 --> 15:50.166
they said that they were looking
for a young woman.

15:51.125 --> 15:54.040
And she's still missing?
I mean, they can't find her anywhere?

15:54.041 --> 15:55.082
That is correct.

15:55.083 --> 15:57.749
And her dad died of a drug overdose?

15:57.750 --> 16:00.707
Well, actually, the Chinese think
that he didn't die of a drug overdose.

16:00.708 --> 16:02.208
They think that he was murdered.

16:02.708 --> 16:06.499
Possibly murdered Chinese ambassador
with a missing daughter

16:06.500 --> 16:08.915
who was receiving phone calls
from a civil servant

16:08.916 --> 16:11.583
the day he was killed
alongside two other people.

16:12.250 --> 16:13.083
[trills lips]

16:13.666 --> 16:14.916
[chuckles]

16:16.416 --> 16:19.249
These webs we weave,
they are tangled, are they not?

16:19.250 --> 16:21.125
- Have you been drinking?
- What?

16:21.875 --> 16:23.582
Your breath smells of wine.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.083
Um, I was at dinner.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.165
Are you pissed?

16:27.166 --> 16:31.041
I think that I can have
three glasses of sauvignon blanc

16:32.166 --> 16:33.457
and still do my job.

16:33.458 --> 16:35.833
- Thank you.
- Was it three glasses though?

16:36.875 --> 16:37.708
Four.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.290
- Five.
- [Helen smacks lips]

16:41.291 --> 16:43.374
And a line of what I thought was cocaine,

16:43.375 --> 16:46.915
but I'm starting to suspect
may have been... ketamine.

16:46.916 --> 16:50.624
Oh great. Cool. So, uh, a bottle of wine
and some horse tranquilizer.

16:50.625 --> 16:53.832
Anything else? Did you shoot up
under a bridge on your way here?

16:53.833 --> 16:55.415
Listen, I have just left

16:55.416 --> 16:57.624
a very enjoyable evening
with some old friends

16:57.625 --> 16:59.916
to come and murder
a hired contract killer for you.

17:00.791 --> 17:03.208
So let's tone down the judgement a tad,
shall we?

17:04.125 --> 17:06.125
[tense music plays]

17:11.666 --> 17:12.665
[music fades]

17:12.666 --> 17:13.666
[softly] Okay.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.874
Your pupils are dilated.

17:16.875 --> 17:18.666
- I'm fine.
- You're fucked!

17:19.541 --> 17:21.040
We're all fucked, darling.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.458
[clatter in lock]

17:30.958 --> 17:31.958
[door closes]

17:32.750 --> 17:33.916
[tense music plays]

17:34.750 --> 17:37.041
[quiet ticking]

17:57.791 --> 17:59.500
[ticking]

18:06.916 --> 18:07.791
[Sam sighs softly]

18:10.416 --> 18:11.249
[music fades]

18:11.250 --> 18:12.166
Fuck.

18:13.500 --> 18:14.415
Well, he's not here.

18:14.416 --> 18:15.333
No.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.708
[Helen sighs] Fuck's sake.

18:23.708 --> 18:24.625
[sighs]

18:25.625 --> 18:27.125
So how did you find him anyway?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.290
I took his fingerprints
off a bullet casing.

18:30.291 --> 18:32.458
- Mm.
- Opposite where Jason was shot.

18:35.625 --> 18:36.458
Right.

18:40.583 --> 18:41.540
What?

18:41.541 --> 18:43.791
No, nothing. It's just...

18:45.625 --> 18:47.500
Well, that seems a bit lax, doesn't it?

18:48.125 --> 18:50.458
For a professional hit man
who was in the SAS

18:51.916 --> 18:55.999
to leave a bullet casing
with his fingerprints on it

18:56.000 --> 18:58.832
that lead directly to his home address?

18:58.833 --> 19:00.583
[ticking and whirring]

19:01.708 --> 19:02.958
[tense music plays]

19:07.041 --> 19:08.499
Shit. Run! Run!

19:08.500 --> 19:09.625
[gunshot]

19:12.625 --> 19:13.791
[mechanism clicks]

19:20.375 --> 19:22.375
[soft, suspenseful music plays]

19:28.208 --> 19:29.250
[Helen gasps]

19:31.166 --> 19:32.958
Oh my God! [gasps]

19:33.791 --> 19:34.625
[Sam] Oh fuck.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.708
Come on. Let's go.

19:40.750 --> 19:42.915
[distant sirens wailing]

19:42.916 --> 19:44.957
[huffs] That was my fault.

19:44.958 --> 19:45.957
No, it wasn't.

19:45.958 --> 19:49.624
Yes, it was. It was obviously a trap.
What the hell was I thinking?

19:49.625 --> 19:51.582
- It's okay.
- [Sam] It's not okay!

19:51.583 --> 19:53.165
Fuck. Fucking idiot.

19:53.166 --> 19:54.790
- [Helen] Can we stop for a minute?
- Why?

19:54.791 --> 19:58.041
Because you dislocated my shoulder
when you pulled me off that balcony.

19:59.208 --> 20:00.124
[grunts] Oh fuck.

20:00.125 --> 20:02.000
- [gasps]
- That was impressive.

20:02.916 --> 20:05.624
You should have seen me when I pushed
two human beings out of my vagina

20:05.625 --> 20:06.665
on the same afternoon.

20:06.666 --> 20:09.749
- Just another Wednesday for you, isn't it?
- Fuck off.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.666
[suspenseful music plays]

20:17.666 --> 20:19.332
- [music stops]
- Check every room.

20:19.333 --> 20:20.625
And text me when it's clear.

20:22.041 --> 20:22.916
Okay.

20:27.416 --> 20:28.666
[Sam] Sleep well, darling.

21:11.416 --> 21:12.500
[cell phone chimes]

21:20.041 --> 21:21.790
- [keys jangle]
- [engine starts, revs]

21:21.791 --> 21:24.041
- [quiet, tense music plays]
- [car departing]

21:58.208 --> 21:59.041
[music fades]

22:32.791 --> 22:33.916
[quiet grunting]

22:34.666 --> 22:35.875
[man groans]

22:37.166 --> 22:39.541
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. Sh, sh, sh, sh.

22:40.125 --> 22:41.791
Your family's asleep upstairs.

22:44.250 --> 22:45.083
They're alive.

22:46.125 --> 22:48.333
They can stay that way.
I assume that's what you want.

22:49.708 --> 22:51.999
Okay, let's work towards that,
then, shall we?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.582
I am here
because the people I'm working for

22:54.583 --> 22:57.750
believe you may be in possession
of something that they desire.

22:58.583 --> 23:01.040
They also believe
you may know the whereabouts

23:01.041 --> 23:03.082
of a person they are looking for.

23:03.083 --> 23:04.374
Do you understand?

23:04.375 --> 23:06.333
[tense music plays]

23:09.291 --> 23:12.832
The item they are looking for
is a digital recording device.

23:12.833 --> 23:15.750
It's a small, black pinhole video camera.

23:16.333 --> 23:17.833
Do you have this device?

23:19.916 --> 23:21.166
Do you know where it is?

23:24.291 --> 23:26.040
It might recently have been
in the possession

23:26.041 --> 23:28.291
of a young woman called Kai-Ming Chen.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.125
Do you know this woman?

23:30.625 --> 23:32.416
[tense music continues]

23:34.500 --> 23:36.665
You do understand
that giving me what I'm looking for

23:36.666 --> 23:39.666
is the difference between a quick
and a prolonged death for you,

23:40.291 --> 23:41.791
between life and death for your family?

23:42.750 --> 23:46.833
You've used the threat of violence
against my family twice now.

23:48.125 --> 23:50.332
For the sake
of your own personal well-being,

23:50.333 --> 23:51.750
I really wouldn't again.

23:55.166 --> 23:56.666
You're Elmore Fitch, aren't you?

23:59.666 --> 24:00.707
Yeah.

24:00.708 --> 24:02.249
[tense music continues]

24:02.250 --> 24:06.166
You shot a man
on the South Bank two nights ago.

24:07.500 --> 24:08.333
You killed him.

24:09.041 --> 24:09.915
Yeah.

24:09.916 --> 24:11.707
You're going to regret that.

24:11.708 --> 24:14.875
- I regret everyone I kill.
- Why'd you do it, then?

24:15.458 --> 24:17.415
Why does the songbird sing?

24:17.416 --> 24:19.082
You're a fucking poet now?

24:19.083 --> 24:21.166
[tense music continues]

24:24.416 --> 24:25.458
What do you know about me?

24:26.041 --> 24:28.832
Helen Webb, politician's wife,
got herself into trouble.

24:28.833 --> 24:30.333
They didn't tell me she could fight.

24:31.708 --> 24:32.916
Maybe they didn't know.

24:33.416 --> 24:34.916
[silenced gunshots]

24:38.208 --> 24:39.083
[Elmore groans]

24:41.666 --> 24:42.665
[Helen groans]

24:42.666 --> 24:44.124
[snores]

24:44.125 --> 24:45.083
[Helen gasps]

24:47.666 --> 24:48.583
[Elmore groans]

24:50.250 --> 24:51.500
[Elmore groans]

24:55.500 --> 24:56.332
[Elmore yells]

24:56.333 --> 24:59.791
- [muffled yell, heavy breathing]
- Sh...

25:01.625 --> 25:02.875
- [knife thrums]
- [Elmore groans]

25:03.375 --> 25:04.665
[muffled groan] Fuck.

25:04.666 --> 25:06.333
[breathes heavily]

25:07.916 --> 25:09.582
Why did you kill Jason?

25:09.583 --> 25:12.208
[both breathing heavily]

25:13.666 --> 25:14.582
He was just a job.

25:14.583 --> 25:16.832
He wasn't just a fucking job.
He was a person.

25:16.833 --> 25:19.499
He was important, and you took him.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.875
You took him from <i>me</i>.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.832
- And you had no right.
- Right's got nothing to do with it.

25:23.833 --> 25:25.791
- You know that.
- Who hired you?

25:27.375 --> 25:28.499
- [Elmore gasps]
- Oh.

25:28.500 --> 25:31.000
I have a cheese grater in the dishwasher.

25:32.291 --> 25:34.540
I have a peeler.
I have skewers. I have a kettle.

25:34.541 --> 25:36.000
I have a Nutribullet.

25:36.583 --> 25:39.665
And so help me God, I'm gonna shove
little pieces of you into it

25:39.666 --> 25:44.916
and turn you into a fucking smoothie
if you don't start talking.

25:46.416 --> 25:49.165
I don't know who hired me to kill Jason.

25:49.166 --> 25:52.707
All I know is,
I was sent a photograph and a name

25:52.708 --> 25:54.791
and 24 hours to complete the job.

25:56.083 --> 25:57.916
They told me I could name my price.

25:59.833 --> 26:01.583
How much was his life worth to you?

26:04.250 --> 26:06.000
[Elmore] A hundred thousand pounds.

26:07.583 --> 26:11.041
[Helen] You're going to die for Jason
and for threatening my kids.

26:11.583 --> 26:14.125
Then I'm gonna find out who hired you,

26:14.875 --> 26:16.250
and I'm gonna kill them.

26:17.458 --> 26:19.416
Well, that's your business, isn't it?

26:21.583 --> 26:22.458
What now?

26:24.000 --> 26:24.875
Garden.

26:25.375 --> 26:26.625
[soft footsteps]

26:34.791 --> 26:35.625
Open it.

26:45.041 --> 26:48.666
He must have been very special,
your friend, if they hired me.

26:50.291 --> 26:51.791
He wouldn't have seen it coming.

26:53.291 --> 26:55.208
He'd barely have known it had happened.

26:58.291 --> 26:59.250
Make it quick.

27:18.333 --> 27:19.208
[silenced gunshot]

27:19.708 --> 27:20.541
[body thuds]

27:23.083 --> 27:24.750
[somber music plays]

27:50.208 --> 27:52.208
[ominous music drones]

27:55.750 --> 27:58.583
- [Wallace breathing softly]
- [poignant music underscores]

28:07.458 --> 28:09.208
[whispers] Can I tell you a secret?

28:10.416 --> 28:11.666
You can tell me anything.

28:13.166 --> 28:14.958
You might not like me as much after.

28:15.708 --> 28:16.875
[Jason] Anything.

28:17.875 --> 28:19.500
[music swells, fades]

28:20.333 --> 28:23.541
- [indistinct chatter on radio]
- [cutlery clinking]

28:32.458 --> 28:33.457
[Wallace] Morning, Marie.

28:33.458 --> 28:35.165
- Morning.
- [kids] Morning.

28:35.166 --> 28:36.915
[Wallace] What did you
get up to last night?

28:36.916 --> 28:38.832
Oh God. I had that drinks thing, remember?

28:38.833 --> 28:40.915
[Wallace] Oh yeah.
Morning, kids. How are you doing?

28:40.916 --> 28:42.040
I got Rudolph.

28:42.041 --> 28:44.665
[Wallace] D'you know Rudolph
isn't actually an official reindeer?

28:44.666 --> 28:47.415
- He was created by a toy company.
- [Jacqueline] What?

28:47.416 --> 28:49.915
- [Wallace] That's very good.
- I got a snowflake.

28:49.916 --> 28:52.165
He <i>is</i> a real reindeer!

28:52.166 --> 28:54.957
None of them
are real reindeer, sweetheart.

28:54.958 --> 28:56.457
[chuckles] Forget I said that.

28:56.458 --> 28:58.499
Yes. We all love Rudolph, don't we?

28:58.500 --> 29:00.290
- We do.
- Could you please eat your breakfast?

29:00.291 --> 29:01.624
What are you doing today?

29:01.625 --> 29:04.499
Got the memorial do later.
The civil servant who was killed.

29:04.500 --> 29:05.708
- James.
- Jason.

29:06.416 --> 29:08.707
[Wallace] Oh God, yeah.
Need to get that right, don't I?

29:08.708 --> 29:11.040
Anyway, it's at some pub in Westminster.

29:11.041 --> 29:14.791
Quite a few important people attending.
They even managed to drag Stephen along.

29:15.625 --> 29:16.832
- Um...
- Yeah?

29:16.833 --> 29:19.874
You know we talked about
getting a bit of security for the house?

29:19.875 --> 29:21.707
Yeah. I'll... I'll talk to someone.

29:21.708 --> 29:22.999
- It's a good idea.
- Mm.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.040
- Um... I shouldn't be too late, okay?
- Okay.

29:26.041 --> 29:27.874
Bye, kids. Bye.

29:27.875 --> 29:29.624
- Hey!
- Oh, look, chocolate reindeer.

29:29.625 --> 29:31.332
See, it is real. Ooh, very good.

29:31.333 --> 29:32.999
- I told you.
- [Wallace] I love you.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.083
[bells jingle]

29:36.208 --> 29:38.208
[Christmas music plays]

29:42.708 --> 29:44.041
[cell phone buzzes]

29:44.750 --> 29:45.582
Hello.

29:45.583 --> 29:48.374
[Reed] <i>Samuel, I need to see you
and Helen urgently.</i>

29:48.375 --> 29:49.458
I'm on my way.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.374
Hi, Lenny.

29:55.375 --> 29:56.791
And Williams.

29:57.416 --> 30:00.332
Imagine my fucking surprise
when I hear the news.

30:00.333 --> 30:02.541
"Sam's back." [chuckles]

30:03.125 --> 30:04.749
What are you gonna do?

30:04.750 --> 30:07.207
- Butter me to death?
- He's holding a gun under the table.

30:07.208 --> 30:08.707
- So are you.
- So am I.

30:08.708 --> 30:13.249
Well, all right, we are not gonna have
a shoot-out in Soho in broad daylight.

30:13.250 --> 30:15.833
I come here for brunch,
for Christ's sakes!

30:17.291 --> 30:18.290
Who's this?

30:18.291 --> 30:19.624
- Eleanor.
- She's my new partner.

30:19.625 --> 30:22.790
Jesus Christ. That didn't take long.
What have you got, a waiting list?

30:22.791 --> 30:26.790
Listen, any overnight business trips,
you insist on separate hotel rooms, okay?

30:26.791 --> 30:29.207
Hands like an octopus,
this one, apparently.

30:29.208 --> 30:31.082
- So what do you want?
- I don't know, Sam.

30:31.083 --> 30:34.958
What could I possibly want with the man
who ran out on me seven years ago?

30:35.625 --> 30:38.457
Could start with an apology,
move on to an explanation,

30:38.458 --> 30:40.750
and eventually arrive at recompense.

30:43.958 --> 30:45.999
Your partner was just business.
You know that.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.540
Doesn't mean I'm not gonna kill you.

30:47.541 --> 30:50.791
[chuckles] Yeah, but there's killing,
and then there's <i>killing</i>. You know?

30:51.375 --> 30:53.707
You wanna come after me,
blow my brains out, I understand.

30:53.708 --> 30:56.165
I wanna make sure
you haven't got a more protracted form

30:56.166 --> 30:57.332
of score-settling in mind.

30:57.333 --> 31:00.332
When it comes to what I've got in mind,
I'd just as soon keep my counsel,

31:00.333 --> 31:01.749
if it's all the same to you.

31:01.750 --> 31:03.875
- Gonna cut my cock off?
- Not straight away.

31:05.791 --> 31:06.915
Who told you I was back?

31:06.916 --> 31:09.874
I am all over this city.
You know that, Sam.

31:09.875 --> 31:12.332
You think I'm unaware of it
if one of my ex-triggermen

31:12.333 --> 31:14.833
is ordering breakfast in fucking W1?

31:15.333 --> 31:17.665
- Who brought you back in?
- [Sam] I'm not telling you shit.

31:17.666 --> 31:19.040
I'm not apologizing for shit,

31:19.041 --> 31:21.249
and I'm not making anything up
to you either.

31:21.250 --> 31:23.707
You and I have got nothing to do
with each other anymore.

31:23.708 --> 31:26.249
As for our thing, sidebar it for a minute.

31:26.250 --> 31:28.207
I need to know
who hired you the other night.

31:28.208 --> 31:30.124
It was anonymous. In and out.

31:30.125 --> 31:32.540
- Easy money till you turned up.
- What were you there for?

31:32.541 --> 31:34.957
- None of your business. You?
- None of <i>your</i> business.

31:34.958 --> 31:38.207
Listen, whatever other job
you've got going on, forget about it.

31:38.208 --> 31:42.707
You shouldn't be working for anyone else.
Not in London. Not while you still owe me.

31:42.708 --> 31:45.458
- What do I owe you?
- You know what you owe me, <i>malaka!</i>

31:46.125 --> 31:47.208
Hector Newman.

31:47.958 --> 31:49.749
[tense music plays]

31:49.750 --> 31:51.249
[thunder rumbling]

31:51.250 --> 31:52.375
[breathes heavily]

31:54.916 --> 31:57.582
I'm not here to... deal with Hector Newman.

31:57.583 --> 32:00.915
[Lenny] No, but, you see, that is exactly
what you're here to deal with.

32:00.916 --> 32:03.415
Because you didn't deal with him
when I asked you.

32:03.416 --> 32:06.207
And now he is a problem.
He is a problem for everyone.

32:06.208 --> 32:09.290
And everyone knows that I'm the prick
who sent the prick to kill the prick,

32:09.291 --> 32:10.375
and you didn't.

32:11.500 --> 32:14.749
And that has led to a severe dent
in my professional reputation.

32:14.750 --> 32:17.957
So now you are gonna give me
the benefit of your expertise

32:17.958 --> 32:20.624
until such time
as I feel adequately compensated

32:20.625 --> 32:22.625
for your past fuckery.

32:24.125 --> 32:26.750
Or else I get these here two involved.

32:27.458 --> 32:28.583
[laughs]

32:29.208 --> 32:31.249
She wants to kill me
whether I do this for you or not.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.332
[Lenny] Yeah,

32:32.333 --> 32:34.832
but I'm not gonna hire her to kill you.

32:34.833 --> 32:38.290
I'm gonna hire her
to go after your boy, Michael.

32:38.291 --> 32:40.999
Now, he was <i>very</i> easy to find.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.499
Him and his daughter.

32:42.500 --> 32:43.958
[tense music continues]

32:44.666 --> 32:45.583
What, my ex?

32:46.708 --> 32:47.790
That's your leverage?

32:47.791 --> 32:49.500
[laughs]

32:50.583 --> 32:52.875
I haven't seen him for years.
I don't give a shit about him.

32:53.458 --> 32:54.707
- [Williams] He's lying.
- I'm not.

32:54.708 --> 32:57.165
- [Eleanor] Why's your eye twitching?
- Why's your mouth moving?

32:57.166 --> 33:01.207
[Lenny] You finish my job for me
or these two take out Michael.

33:01.208 --> 33:02.957
- [cup clatters]
- That's the deal.

33:02.958 --> 33:04.458
- [chair shuffles]
- Oh.

33:06.041 --> 33:07.666
Here's what he looks like now.

33:08.500 --> 33:11.250
Got himself a little drug warehouse
in Brixton.

33:11.916 --> 33:14.291
It'll be guarded. Take it out.

33:14.791 --> 33:15.790
Lenny, I can't.

33:15.791 --> 33:16.790
[Lenny] Listen.

33:16.791 --> 33:19.125
You haven't got a choice, pickle.

33:20.041 --> 33:22.124
Comfort yourself with that thought.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.416
[tense music continues]

33:32.125 --> 33:36.374
You know, the polite thing to do would be
to apologize for killing my partner.

33:36.375 --> 33:38.332
- [door opens]
- I'm sorry I killed your partner.

33:38.333 --> 33:40.082
- [door closes]
- Are we friends?

33:40.083 --> 33:43.332
No. I'm still gonna fucking murder you.

33:43.333 --> 33:44.333
Okay.

33:45.375 --> 33:47.250
[tense music continues]

33:53.041 --> 33:54.082
[Williams laughs]

33:54.083 --> 33:56.166
[tense music continues]

34:00.791 --> 34:01.958
[door opens]

34:02.750 --> 34:04.165
- Shit.
- [door closes]

34:04.166 --> 34:06.250
[tense music continues]

34:07.958 --> 34:09.832
- [music fades]
- [machine whirring]

34:09.833 --> 34:10.749
[powers down]

34:10.750 --> 34:13.915
[TV reporter] <i>...provide any information

<i>for the daughter

<i>Kai-Ming Chen, 21,</i>

- [line ringing]

34:34.083 --> 34:36.207
- [man] <i>Hey, boss.</i>
- That girl from the other night.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.374
Is she still there?

34:37.375 --> 34:39.332
[man] <i>Yeah, she's in Kelly's office.</i>

[Hector] Well... aren't we lucky?

35:13.625 --> 35:15.875
- [man 1] There you go, my friend.
- [man 2] Thank you.

35:17.916 --> 35:20.499
The Chinese are calling into question
the coroner's report.

35:20.500 --> 35:22.374
But that's not the main problem right now.

35:22.375 --> 35:24.874
The problem is who the Chinese
are accusing of being involved.

35:24.875 --> 35:26.457
- Accusing? They've got a suspect?
- Yes.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.791
- Not saying we did it?
- They're saying the Americans did.

35:29.291 --> 35:31.915
- Oh fuck. That's worse.
- And saying we've helped cover it up.

35:31.916 --> 35:33.915
- Oh, that's much fucking worse.
- Yeah.

35:33.916 --> 35:35.290
What are the Americans saying?

35:35.291 --> 35:37.165
[man 2] Denial in the strongest of terms.

35:37.166 --> 35:40.582
Do we know if Beijing are gonna produce
any actual evidence of anything?

35:40.583 --> 35:41.790
We wait with bated breath.

35:41.791 --> 35:44.250
Oh, well, I love waiting
with bated breath.

35:44.833 --> 35:47.291
- What about the daughter, Kai-Ming?
- Still missing.

35:48.125 --> 35:50.458
I suppose I have to
ask the question. [scoffs]

35:51.708 --> 35:53.916
What if they're telling the truth, Bill?

35:55.291 --> 35:57.415
If the Yanks killed the ambassador?

35:57.416 --> 35:58.375
[Wallace] Mm-hmm.

36:00.791 --> 36:02.207
Start digging a bomb shelter.

36:02.208 --> 36:03.916
- [chuckles wryly]
- [Bill sighs]

36:04.708 --> 36:06.415
That's Christmas canceled, isn't it?

36:06.416 --> 36:08.500
[birds squawking]

36:09.750 --> 36:11.750
[footsteps sploshing]

36:14.875 --> 36:16.040
What's going on?

36:16.041 --> 36:18.665
Elmore Fitch was in my house last night.

36:18.666 --> 36:21.165
What? What happened? Are the kids okay?

36:21.166 --> 36:23.333
He's dead. I shot him. He's in my shed.

36:24.041 --> 36:24.916
He's dead?

36:27.083 --> 36:28.000
In your shed?

36:30.208 --> 36:31.957
So, what? So we're done?

36:31.958 --> 36:33.415
No, we're not done.

36:33.416 --> 36:36.582
We need to find the people who sent him
and the other assassins.

36:36.583 --> 36:38.499
If they sent one man, they'll send more.

36:38.500 --> 36:41.790
Well, it was an anonymous job.
I mean, I assume.

36:41.791 --> 36:43.540
So Fitch was looking for a camera?

36:43.541 --> 36:45.165
Yeah, so were Kent and Williams.

36:45.166 --> 36:49.165
So there's a video out there
that people are trying to get hold of?

36:49.166 --> 36:50.624
[Reed] There always is these days.

36:50.625 --> 36:52.707
[Helen] And Fitch was looking
for Kai-Ming too.

36:52.708 --> 36:54.499
She holds the key to all of this.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.624
Of the three people
murdered the other night,

36:56.625 --> 36:59.290
Maggie went to school with Kai-Ming Chen.

36:59.291 --> 37:02.790
Phillip, over a two-year period,
wrote 12 rather tawdry articles

37:02.791 --> 37:05.749
about her party lifestyle
for the <i>Weekday</i> newspaper.

37:05.750 --> 37:07.250
And Jason, well...

37:08.125 --> 37:11.707
Other than the fact that Jason called her
five times before he died,

37:11.708 --> 37:15.999
we can't find a single link or any reason
why Jason would have known Kai-Ming

37:16.000 --> 37:17.416
or any of the deceased.

37:18.875 --> 37:20.416
So I'll ask you again, Helen.

37:21.666 --> 37:23.999
Did you tell Jason
anything you shouldn't have?

37:24.000 --> 37:26.874
- No.
- [Reed] And he never asked you anything?

37:26.875 --> 37:30.665
What, like what?
"Are you a spy?" No, weirdly, he didn't.

37:30.666 --> 37:32.915
But do you know what,
instead of interrogating me,

37:32.916 --> 37:35.833
why don't you do something useful,
like find Kai-Ming?

37:39.083 --> 37:39.958
[door slams]

37:42.125 --> 37:44.083
[Reed] So now we know she's a target.

37:44.666 --> 37:47.832
It will reflect very poorly on you
if someone kills her, you know.

37:47.833 --> 37:50.124
So I do hope you're giving this
your full attention.

37:50.125 --> 37:53.624
She's right about Kai-Ming. We need to
find her and find out what she knows.

37:53.625 --> 37:55.708
Yes, but let's tread lightly, shall we?

37:56.416 --> 37:58.207
Ambassadors' daughters make me nervous.

37:58.208 --> 38:00.624
I'd love to avoid triggering
a diplomatic incident.

38:00.625 --> 38:02.665
Especially as we're not being paid to.

38:02.666 --> 38:03.875
Tread lightly. Got it.

38:04.583 --> 38:06.375
I'll send the progress report.

- [Wallace] Yeah, she's fine.

[Wallace] <i>...this ambassador thing

40:50.708 --> 40:53.665
The Chinese are about to tell everyone
the Americans had a hand in it.

40:53.666 --> 40:55.374
[Stephen] They don't have any evidence.

40:55.375 --> 40:57.457
[Wallace] We don't know
what they've got, do we?

40:57.458 --> 41:00.374
[Stephen] I'm all over that case,
and they certainly don't have that.

41:00.375 --> 41:01.332
How's the PM?

41:01.333 --> 41:03.124
Well, he's... he's worried.

41:03.125 --> 41:06.540
- [Stephen] <i>They're not gonna go to war.</i>
- [Wallace] <i>They might. They fucking might.</i>

41:06.541 --> 41:09.500
If they actually think the Americans
killed their ambassador, fucking hell.

41:10.791 --> 41:12.540
<i>So we need to talk about Phillip Bray,</i>

41:12.541 --> 41:14.332

41:14.333 --> 41:17.083
<i>and said he had a story
and some footage of you.</i>

41:17.666 --> 41:21.083
- [Stephen] <i>I wish you'd made me aware.</i>
- Yeah, but now he's dead, Stephen.

41:21.791 --> 41:22.832

<i>I have no idea what he's talking about
or what his footage could be.</i>

41:30.416 --> 41:33.999
[Wallace] <i>But the Chinese are saying
that we helped cover up a fucking crime.</i>

41:34.000 --> 41:35.915
- There hasn't been a crime.
- Stephen.

41:35.916 --> 41:37.165
What are you asking me?

41:37.166 --> 41:38.625
What am I...? [scoffs]

41:39.583 --> 41:42.832
Phillip Bray comes to me.
He said he had a story of you.

41:42.833 --> 41:46.333
He said it was linked to China,
and now he's fucking dead.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.207
<i>Did you have
anything to do with his death?</i>

41:50.208 --> 41:54.082
<i>- Are you hiding something?</i>
- [Stephen] <i>Jesus Christ, Wallace.</i>

41:54.083 --> 41:56.540
[Wallace] <i>I'm trying to grasp
what the hell is happening.</i>

41:56.541 --> 41:58.916
And that's it, Wallace. You're grasping.

41:59.666 --> 42:01.290
- Stephen.
- [Stephen] Look.

42:01.291 --> 42:03.957
The Chinese can make
as much noise as they want about this,

42:03.958 --> 42:07.125
but my officers have looked into
the death of Ambassador Chen.

42:07.625 --> 42:08.875
There's been no crime.

Don't get sentimental.

Do you think
that you might be a psychopath, Williams?

44:50.958 --> 44:52.375
Yeah, it's possible, I suppose.
