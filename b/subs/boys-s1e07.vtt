Oi, gorgeous.

01:05.858 --> 01:08.694
-Vodka soda, hold the soda.
-Thank you.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.905
Drinks are free,
but the food's bloody awful.

01:10.946 --> 01:12.656
Ahi tartare, for fuck's sakes.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.283
Okay. Just let me shake
a few more hands,

01:14.325 --> 01:16.368
and then we'll be
out of here-- whoa.

01:16.410 --> 01:19.163
Easy, tiger.
I want you on your "A" game.

01:19.205 --> 01:21.165
-"A" game?
-Mm-hmm.

01:21.207 --> 01:22.666
You know,
I like the sound of that.

01:22.708 --> 01:23.918
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:23.959 --> 01:25.503
HOMELANDER:
Merry Christmas.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.506
Becca.

01:28.589 --> 01:32.927
New senior director,
digital marketing.

01:32.968 --> 01:35.888
-Uh, yeah. How did you know?
-I have my sources.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.682
And your nametag.

01:38.724 --> 01:41.227
-(chuckles)
-Yes, that, too. (laughs)

01:41.268 --> 01:43.896
-Uh, this is my husband, Billy.
-Great to meet you.

01:43.938 --> 01:45.231
Billy Butcher.

01:45.272 --> 01:48.400
Becca, you handled
my takeover, right?

01:48.442 --> 01:50.236
Y-Yes, I-I did.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.029
-You saw it?
-I loved it.

01:52.071 --> 01:54.323
-U-Uh, wow. Thank you. (laughs)
-No, thank you.

01:54.365 --> 01:56.158
-What'd you take over?
-BECCA: Vought's
Twitter account.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.160
-Yeah.
-Your brilliant wife here

01:58.202 --> 01:59.662
did all the work.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.914
She posted my photos,
she wrote my messages.

02:01.956 --> 02:03.457
It was exceptional.

02:03.499 --> 02:06.126
All right, so they thought
it was you up there,

02:06.168 --> 02:07.837
but it was really Becca.

02:07.878 --> 02:09.213
-(chuckles)
-Bit deceptive, isn't it?

02:09.255 --> 02:10.840
Uh, no, Billy, that's what we do

02:10.881 --> 02:12.675
'cause Homelander's busy
saving lives.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.718
It's okay, it's okay.
I-It-- you're right.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.387
It's a little dishonest,

02:16.428 --> 02:19.098
but I'm all thumbs when
it comes to that kind of stuff,

02:19.139 --> 02:20.891
so leave it to the experts.

02:20.933 --> 02:23.477
Listen, I would
love to talk to you

02:23.519 --> 02:26.063
about maybe quarterbacking
the rest of my social media.

02:26.105 --> 02:28.107
-Seriously?
-Absolutely.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.692
My dad, he always said,

02:29.733 --> 02:33.571
"Surround yourself with people
smarter than you."

02:34.780 --> 02:37.366
Oh, my, uh, better half is, uh,

02:37.408 --> 02:39.869
wanting my attention, but maybe
we could chat tomorrow.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.161
That sounds wonderful.
Thank you.

02:41.203 --> 02:43.539
Thank you.
Greet to meet you, pal.

02:43.581 --> 02:45.249
Good to meet you.

02:45.291 --> 02:47.668
Love that accent.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.423
Hello, beautiful.

02:52.464 --> 02:54.008
How the fuck does he walk around

02:54.049 --> 02:56.010
in that sweaty fucking wetsuit
all day long,

02:56.051 --> 02:58.429
-balls mashed up against his leg
like pancakes?
-Oh, shh.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.097
-What?
-You promised to behave.

03:00.139 --> 03:02.182
-Let's get the fuck out of here.
-Yeah?

03:02.224 --> 03:03.434
Yeah.

03:05.728 --> 03:07.730
(siren wailing in distance)

03:15.279 --> 03:16.906
HUGHIE:
Hi.

03:50.189 --> 03:52.191
(both moaning)

03:59.782 --> 04:01.408
(gasps)

04:23.389 --> 04:25.599
-Huh.
-Hmm.

04:25.641 --> 04:28.978
I didn't realize you were
such a cigar aficionado.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.187
(laughs)

04:30.229 --> 04:32.231
I really, I just...

04:32.272 --> 04:36.402
Mm. I can't get enough
of huge gross logs

04:36.443 --> 04:38.570
-of filterless tobacco.
-(chuckles)

04:47.496 --> 04:50.457
(laughs softly)

04:50.499 --> 04:52.960
-This is all really nice.
-Mm-hmm.

04:55.713 --> 04:58.090
But...

04:58.132 --> 05:00.592
There is a "but" coming.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.219
Okay.

05:02.261 --> 05:06.598
But why did you bring me
to a hotel?

05:06.640 --> 05:09.184
Hmm? And not your place?

05:09.226 --> 05:12.479
Well, you know.
I mean, yeah, sure, my Dad

05:12.521 --> 05:16.025
(laughs): could make you
some post-coital pizza rolls.

05:16.066 --> 05:20.070
I just figured this would be
slightly less humiliating.

05:20.112 --> 05:23.282
Yeah, all right.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.492
Yeah.

05:25.534 --> 05:28.495
Yeah, very convincing.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.789
You okay? What's going on?

05:32.583 --> 05:34.710
It's just...

05:36.420 --> 05:39.173
I've never seen your place,
or your job.

05:39.214 --> 05:41.800
You're kind of a mystery to me.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.635
T-That's hot, right?

05:43.677 --> 05:47.639
Look, you got to understand
that my dad

05:47.681 --> 05:52.269
was nothing but corny jokes
and expensive gifts,

05:52.311 --> 05:57.191
until he was gone, and all
the money along with him.

05:57.232 --> 06:01.236
I know that
that's not you, but...

06:03.030 --> 06:07.076
I need to know that the hotel
is a nice thing

06:07.117 --> 06:09.745
and not a red flag thing.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.251
I quit my job.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.422
Um, I'm sorry, I-I...

06:20.464 --> 06:23.217
I really should've told you.

06:25.177 --> 06:29.348
After Robin, programming
other people's remotes,

06:29.389 --> 06:32.351
it felt kind of pointless.

06:34.853 --> 06:37.648
And yeah, I mean,
you can-you can meet my dad,

06:37.689 --> 06:40.109
but you're gonna
regret asking that.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.907
So everything's okay?

06:49.910 --> 06:52.329
It's great.

06:54.706 --> 06:56.708
No red flags.

06:58.544 --> 07:00.546
Hmm.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.350
(birds singing)

08:03.483 --> 08:07.446
Now, I know this is not
as swanky as New York City,

08:07.487 --> 08:11.116
but to have a hero like you in
a place like Sandusky, I mean,

08:11.158 --> 08:14.786
everyone down at the local
branch is just tickled pink.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.664
-Yeah.
-Now, we got Cedar Point,

08:17.706 --> 08:21.293
biggest roller-coaster park
in the whole U.S. of A.

08:21.335 --> 08:24.713
We're just a couple short hours
from Cleveland or Toledo.

08:24.755 --> 08:28.425
And Lake Erie? Right here,

08:28.467 --> 08:30.469
-if you want to swim.
-Oh, yeah.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.346
Ooh. Uh...

08:32.387 --> 08:33.847
There it is.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.557
-What's this?
-That's your per diem.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.392
You get $75 a day.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.478
Grocery store,
right down the street.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.105
To make my own food?

08:42.147 --> 08:43.607
There's a Dairy Queen, too.

08:43.649 --> 08:44.816
Like Blizzards and stuff?

08:44.858 --> 08:46.235
You betcha.

08:46.276 --> 08:47.819
Well...
(sighs)

08:47.861 --> 08:50.113
I mean, what about
my crime itinerary?

08:50.155 --> 08:52.491
I think the best thing's just
to, you know, get out there

08:52.532 --> 08:53.784
and put some points
on the board.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.410
Not much crime in Sandusky.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.329
I mean, we're not a shithole
like Akron.

08:57.371 --> 08:58.789
(laughs)

08:58.830 --> 09:02.584
But if something comes up,
we'll call.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.336
You'll call?

09:04.378 --> 09:07.464
-Absolutely.
-Okay.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.093
♪ I'm all out of love ♪

09:11.134 --> 09:13.011

(vomits)

09:38.578 --> 09:41.581
-Oh, this is killing me.
-Come on.

09:41.623 --> 09:45.460
(groaning)

09:45.502 --> 09:47.296
Damn.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.298
Oh, no fucking way.

09:49.339 --> 09:53.343
You need 3,000 calories an hour,
or you're gonna pass out.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.762
I can't do this shit, man.

09:55.804 --> 09:57.848
Tough shit.

09:57.889 --> 09:59.641
You heard the doc.

09:59.683 --> 10:02.728
Your heart is getting bigger,
balls are getting smaller,

10:02.769 --> 10:04.479
your bone density's for shit.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.398
That Compound V shit
is killing you.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.941
Hey. Don't even say it out loud,
all right?

10:07.983 --> 10:09.276
You don't know shit about it,
you understand?

10:09.318 --> 10:11.320
I don't want to know.

10:11.361 --> 10:14.489
And you're done, okay?
No more fucking around.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.533
Did you see my last time
out there?

10:16.575 --> 10:19.411
Sioux City's got a fucking
faster runner than me.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.955
Then no more club openings
and commercial shoots.

10:21.997 --> 10:23.623
Okay? None of that shit.
We train.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.042
Back to the basics.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.961
Nobody gets it back at my age.

10:28.003 --> 10:31.506
I'm gonna be a freak show
like Ben Johnson,

10:31.548 --> 10:33.383
racing against horses.

10:33.425 --> 10:36.595
At least you'll still
be breathing.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.638
(phone chimes)

10:40.849 --> 10:42.225
(sighs):
Shit.

10:42.267 --> 10:45.479
-I got to go.
-Where?

10:49.191 --> 10:51.193
(sighs)

10:53.820 --> 10:56.406
-What's going on?
-I missed you guys.

10:56.448 --> 10:59.910
Just wanted to see
your smiling faces.

10:59.951 --> 11:02.662
-(claps shoulder)
-Take a seat, buddy.

11:05.832 --> 11:10.003
And, truth be known,
I felt like we were overdue

11:10.045 --> 11:12.589
a little heart-to-heart.

11:12.631 --> 11:15.842
A rap session,
maybe a little tough love.

11:15.884 --> 11:18.136
(scoffs)
What's that supposed to mean?

11:18.178 --> 11:19.971
(Homelander sighs)

11:20.013 --> 11:23.725
It means that lately,
some of you

11:23.767 --> 11:27.604
have been, eh,
a little out of sorts.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.982
Erratic.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.068
Unreliable.

11:33.110 --> 11:37.030
Downright sloppy.

11:37.072 --> 11:39.032
Not you, Noir.
You've been great.

11:39.074 --> 11:41.576
But the rest of you...

11:41.618 --> 11:43.787
(clicking tongue)

11:43.829 --> 11:48.917
It is fair to say
that I am disappointed.

11:48.959 --> 11:52.087
Got to keep your eye
on the ball, guys.

11:52.129 --> 11:54.423
The enemies
are storming the gates.

11:54.464 --> 11:58.677
I mean, we're not even The Seven
anymore, we're down to five.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.179
We're dropping
like fucking flies,

12:01.221 --> 12:04.558
but at least now I know why.

12:07.978 --> 12:09.729
Uh...

12:09.771 --> 12:12.941
Why...

12:12.983 --> 12:15.068
Is this a joke?
Why is Hughie up there?

12:15.110 --> 12:16.695
I don't understand.
Who is this guy?

12:16.736 --> 12:19.156
This guy is Hugh Campbell.

12:19.197 --> 12:22.492
He and Starlight
are going steady.

12:22.534 --> 12:26.746
He's also one of the guys
who killed Translucent.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.498
Wait, what?

12:28.540 --> 12:30.000
HOMELANDER:
As well as blackmailing

12:30.041 --> 12:33.962
Mesmer, Ezekiel, Popclaw

12:34.004 --> 12:35.672
-and God knows who else.
-Popclaw?

12:35.714 --> 12:39.092
No. No, no, no.
You-- That-that is insane.

12:39.134 --> 12:42.679
Starlight, sticks and stones
won't break my bones,

12:42.721 --> 12:45.223
-but words...
-No, sir.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.602
I'm sorry. I wasn't...

12:48.643 --> 12:50.520
It's just, he's not...

12:51.980 --> 12:53.482
I mean, why would he do that?

12:53.523 --> 12:56.193
Good question.
A-Train, over to you.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.196
-What?
-HOMELANDER: Oh, boy.

12:59.237 --> 13:03.074
That little egg of yours
is still scrambled, huh?

13:04.493 --> 13:06.620
How about now?

13:06.661 --> 13:09.498
Oh, shit.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.500
I know this guy.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.126
HOMELANDER:
You did smash through
his girlfriend,

13:13.168 --> 13:14.544
so I should hope so.

13:14.586 --> 13:17.797
Robin s-something or other.

13:17.839 --> 13:22.761
I-I remember now, I-I've seen
him outside of Popclaw's place.

13:22.802 --> 13:26.014
He was all in my face.

13:26.056 --> 13:29.142
-You're fucking this guy?
-S-- Okay, slow down.

13:29.184 --> 13:31.019
I don't know what's going on,

13:31.061 --> 13:34.940
but Hughie is not capable
of anything close to this.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.609
Well, that is true, actually.
That's very true.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.736
He is just a man, and,

13:39.778 --> 13:41.863
(laughs): by the looks of it,
not much of one.

13:41.905 --> 13:44.074
But... but hear me out.

13:44.115 --> 13:48.203
W-What if he was helped? Hmm?

13:48.245 --> 13:50.956
Say someone,

13:50.997 --> 13:52.582
I don't know,

13:52.624 --> 13:54.668
got him in to see Ezekiel

13:54.709 --> 13:57.462
and got rid of the Deep.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.798
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.

13:59.839 --> 14:03.552
Keep those hands down
by your sides, missy.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.598
Sit down.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.984
Now... I know

14:19.025 --> 14:21.653
that you want to make
this whole Deep thing

14:21.695 --> 14:23.572
an "All the single ladies"
moment.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.365
Power, right?

14:25.407 --> 14:28.201
But really, what you've done

14:28.243 --> 14:31.246
is pulled off
every criminal's wet dream.

14:31.288 --> 14:34.958
I mean, The Seven
is down by two.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.711
I just can't help noticing
that it all started

14:37.752 --> 14:40.714
when you came along,
which makes me wonder,

14:40.755 --> 14:43.550
which one of us is next, hmm?

14:43.592 --> 14:45.093
You bitch.

14:45.135 --> 14:48.263
-I didn't do anything.
-HOMELANDER: Enough!

14:48.305 --> 14:50.849
We're a different fucking breed.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.475
We shine with the golden light

14:52.517 --> 14:56.313
of providence, but you,
you've been helping these

14:56.354 --> 14:57.731
fucking mud people

14:57.772 --> 15:00.984
-to go against us.
-No.

15:01.026 --> 15:04.237
Shut your fucking mouth,
young lady.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.450
If you were in my position...

15:10.910 --> 15:13.496
...what would you do to you?

15:13.538 --> 15:15.081
(crying)

15:15.123 --> 15:17.000
Homelander, that's enough.

15:17.042 --> 15:19.044
You got something to add, Maeve?

15:21.379 --> 15:23.340
She didn't know.

15:23.381 --> 15:26.176
Well, she stinks of adrenaline

15:26.217 --> 15:29.095
and her heart's beating
like a little rabbit.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.348
The only thing she's guilty of
is being fucking stupid.

15:31.389 --> 15:34.601
She obviously fell
for this Hugh Campbell guy

15:34.643 --> 15:36.728
and he's pumping her
for information,

15:36.770 --> 15:39.272
so back off, leave her alone.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.364
Wow.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.532
Starlight,

15:49.574 --> 15:51.785
you must be something special.

15:51.826 --> 15:53.620
Hmm?

15:53.662 --> 15:57.248
I can't remember the last time
Maeve gave a shit ab--

15:57.290 --> 15:58.875
Well, gave a shit about anyone,

15:58.917 --> 16:00.919
really.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.722
And if I say no?

16:14.766 --> 16:17.686
Come on.

16:17.727 --> 16:19.813
(whispering):
I got this.

16:19.854 --> 16:22.565
It's you and me,

16:22.607 --> 16:24.901
remember?

16:30.198 --> 16:32.867
(whispering): Don't say
I never do anything for you.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.623
All right.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.626
You want her, you got her.
She's your responsibility now.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.003
I just hope
you're right about her,

16:44.045 --> 16:46.047
for both your sakes.

16:47.549 --> 16:49.175
Class dismissed.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.440
Look at this.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.525
Oh, no. You don't stir,

17:05.567 --> 17:07.485
you fold. Like this.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.240
Now that's what
makes them spongy.

17:12.282 --> 17:14.576
Here you go.

17:14.617 --> 17:15.952
(door opens)

17:21.708 --> 17:23.501
She wants to know
where you were.

17:23.543 --> 17:26.671
That's a compelling
fucking question.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.717
Hey, can we talk?

17:30.759 --> 17:32.135
That's what we're doing,
innit?

17:32.177 --> 17:33.928
No, I mean...

17:33.970 --> 17:36.973
There ain't no secrets here,
son. Spit it out.

17:37.015 --> 17:39.434
Stop being an asshole,
just talk to the guy.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.269
Hughie doesn't mind.
Do you, Hughie?

17:45.064 --> 17:48.902
Okay, fine. I don't think
I can do this anymore.

17:50.779 --> 17:53.907
-Do what?
-This.

17:53.948 --> 17:56.367
I mean, Vought,
whatever with Kimiko,

17:56.409 --> 17:58.745
it's-it's awful,
and you got to stop it,

17:58.787 --> 18:01.206
-but I can't.
-Right.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.833
You just want to kick back,
drink a few Mai Tais,

18:03.875 --> 18:05.877
and let us do all the work,
is that it?

18:05.919 --> 18:07.545
You know, I managed to go
my whole life

18:07.587 --> 18:08.963
without seeing someone
die horribly,

18:09.005 --> 18:10.673
and now I'm up to about
a half dozen,

18:10.715 --> 18:12.091
-so I think I'm good.
-Please.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.427
You're a fucking killer, Hughie,

18:14.469 --> 18:17.222
just like the rest of us.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.516
Now, why don't you
stop pissing around

18:19.557 --> 18:22.393
and tell everybody what this
is really all about?

18:22.435 --> 18:24.813
-Yeah?
-Fine.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.481
Annie.

18:26.523 --> 18:27.649
-Fuck.
-HUGHIE: Okay?

18:27.690 --> 18:29.567
It's about Annie.

18:32.654 --> 18:33.863
Fucking finally.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.993
He's been sneaking off to
give her one at Lincoln Grand.

18:39.035 --> 18:41.204
-You've been following me?
-Like you gave me a choice.

18:41.246 --> 18:43.915
She doesn't know anything, okay?
I'm not gonna tell her anything.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.083
-All right? We'll just...
-Just what?

18:45.124 --> 18:47.168
Fuck off to Epcot? The Hamptons?

18:47.210 --> 18:48.628
Maybe pump out a few
flying babies?

18:48.670 --> 18:50.421
No. I... I don't know.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.590
No, you don't know
'cause you ain't thinking,

18:52.632 --> 18:55.218
-except with your dick.
-You're wrong about her.

18:55.260 --> 18:58.346
That bitch is fucking
playing you,

18:58.388 --> 19:00.014
and you're too fucking blind
to see it.

19:00.056 --> 19:02.058
Right, so better to be loyal
to a dead woman

19:02.100 --> 19:03.476
who doesn't know
and doesn't care?

19:03.518 --> 19:05.520
How's that working out for you?

19:17.740 --> 19:20.285
(cell phone ringing)

19:25.039 --> 19:27.792
-HUGHIE: Hey, Dad.
-MAN (on phone): Hey, Hughie.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.752
Long time no talk.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.796
You know, I've been thinking
about you a lot lately.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.089
Who's this?

19:33.131 --> 19:34.716
I thought you would
recognize my voice.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.885
You spend so much time obsessing
about me, am I right?

19:36.926 --> 19:40.805
-Say hi to your baby boy, Dad.
-Oh. H-Hey, hey, hey, Hughie.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.932
Why is he here? He says you're
in some kind of trouble.

19:42.974 --> 19:44.183
Dad, are you okay?

19:45.393 --> 19:47.020
Oh, o-okay.

19:47.061 --> 19:49.564
He's fine.
Remington Steele's almost on.

19:49.606 --> 19:51.524
A-Train, listen to me.

19:51.566 --> 19:54.652
Oh, shit, if he's burned,
then I'm fucked.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.070
HUGHIE:
He's on fucking Medicaid.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.405
He's harmless. Let him go.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.532
My place is burned.
They've got me.

19:59.574 --> 20:01.868
Oh, my God.

20:01.910 --> 20:03.912
Get your ass over here
in 20 minutes,

20:03.953 --> 20:06.122
or I'm gonna burst through him
like a fucking piñata,

20:06.164 --> 20:08.666
do you understand me?
Just like I did your girlfriend.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.043
-Yeah. Got it.
-And, Hughie,

20:10.084 --> 20:12.545
alone. If I catch a whiff,

20:12.587 --> 20:14.005
a whiff of one of your

20:14.047 --> 20:15.840
-little asshole friends...
-I got it.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.178
All my bank accounts are frozen
and flagged. Monique,

20:20.219 --> 20:21.804
listen, when you get this,

20:21.846 --> 20:25.183
leave the house immediately.
Lay low and call me.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.310
-Well, I hope she was
fucking worth it.
-It's not Annie.

20:27.352 --> 20:28.811
-She doesn't know.
-It doesn't matter.

20:28.853 --> 20:31.189
-I'm gonna fucking do her in.
-The hell you will!

20:31.230 --> 20:33.524
Hey, hold on a second.
She doesn't know. It wasn't her.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.943
She's never seen me before.

20:34.984 --> 20:38.071
Not once, not ever.
So how did I get burned?

20:40.990 --> 20:44.035
Mesmer. You fucking idiots

20:44.077 --> 20:45.703
had to go to Mesmer.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.372
Fuck me.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.627
Thank you.

20:52.669 --> 20:55.338
That was not smart,
to sleep with her.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.517
-Hughie.
-Dad.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.270
(whispering):
He's acting strange.

21:11.312 --> 21:12.772
You know, real jumpy.

21:12.814 --> 21:15.400
-Where is he?
-I don't know, he...

21:15.441 --> 21:18.152
Right here, sport. (laughs)

21:18.194 --> 21:21.030
Look what I got.

21:23.074 --> 21:25.994
Special 2016 Comic-Con edition?

21:26.035 --> 21:27.996
What, did they make, like,
a few hundred of these?

21:28.037 --> 21:30.498
-Watch out, A-Train's coming.
-(laughing)

21:30.540 --> 21:32.959
You were a fan!

21:33.001 --> 21:35.670
You were a fan, and not,
like, a dabbler, no,

21:35.712 --> 21:37.880
you were super fan 99.

21:37.922 --> 21:39.090
Excuse me, sir.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.675
-W-What is this about?
-Shut the fuck up.

21:40.717 --> 21:43.219
Dad, it's gonna be okay. Hey.

21:43.261 --> 21:45.763
I came alone.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.974
You let him go.

21:49.017 --> 21:51.019
Alone, huh?

21:51.060 --> 21:52.937
-Wow.
-Ah!

21:52.979 --> 21:54.647
You really did come alone.

21:54.689 --> 21:57.025
Next time-- there's not gonna be
a next time, but next time--

21:57.066 --> 22:00.611
have at least
a few cards up your sleeve.

22:00.653 --> 22:04.490
Okay. You mean, um,
you mean, like this?

22:06.701 --> 22:10.163
-Jonesing for a little jet fuel?
-W-What is that?

22:10.204 --> 22:12.123
I don't know what that shit is.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.791
Oh, you don't?

22:13.833 --> 22:16.586
So you don't mind if I do this.

22:16.627 --> 22:17.587
-No, fuck!
-What?

22:17.628 --> 22:18.963
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

22:19.005 --> 22:20.131
I have a bigger dose.

22:20.173 --> 22:21.716
I have a real dose
hidden somewhere outside.

22:21.758 --> 22:23.301
Let him go, I hand it over,

22:23.342 --> 22:25.678
then you can do whatever
you want with me.

22:25.720 --> 22:28.431
Now tell me what's better,
the rush or knowing that,

22:28.473 --> 22:30.641
as long as you take it,
you'll be the fastest?

22:39.275 --> 22:41.444
If you try anything,

22:41.486 --> 22:44.155
I can catch up to dear old daddy
in a millisecond.

22:44.197 --> 22:46.032
-Dad, time to go.
-Not without you.

22:46.074 --> 22:47.408
I'll be right behind you.

22:47.450 --> 22:49.035
I am not leaving you
with him, all right.

22:49.077 --> 22:50.495
You're just a kid.
You're my kid.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.789
Dad.

22:52.830 --> 22:55.208
I'll be all right.

22:55.249 --> 22:57.168
I got this.

22:59.253 --> 23:01.964
Go.

23:04.675 --> 23:06.844
(door opens, closes)

23:06.886 --> 23:10.098
All right, where is it?

23:10.139 --> 23:14.268
You know, this shit
must be pretty good

23:14.310 --> 23:16.896
if it's worth running through
a human being for.

23:16.938 --> 23:19.148
Oh, my God, man,
that was an accident.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.943
-Where the fuck is the V?
-That accident had a name.

23:21.984 --> 23:23.361
And what about Popclaw?

23:23.402 --> 23:26.072
She had a name, too.

23:26.114 --> 23:29.200
Charlotte!

23:29.242 --> 23:32.829
The only good thing
in my life is gone now.

23:32.870 --> 23:35.373
What is this, man? I kill your
girlfriend and you kill mine?

23:35.414 --> 23:36.791
I didn't kill your girlfriend.

23:36.833 --> 23:38.459
You used her.

23:38.501 --> 23:40.378
You put her in danger,

23:40.419 --> 23:43.256
and then you threw her out
like she was fucking garbage.

23:44.799 --> 23:47.552
How does this not all start
with you, Hughie?

23:47.593 --> 23:49.470
The only difference
between you and me

23:49.512 --> 23:50.930
is that I made a mistake.

23:50.972 --> 23:53.057
The shit that you did
was on purpose.

23:53.099 --> 23:56.102
So who's worse?

23:56.144 --> 23:58.771
(screaming)

23:58.813 --> 24:00.356
You bitch!

24:00.398 --> 24:01.858
You know, you're right.

24:01.899 --> 24:03.651
It would've been stupid
to come alone.

24:03.693 --> 24:05.862
(grunting)

24:05.903 --> 24:08.239
(groaning)

24:08.281 --> 24:10.783
MOTHER'S MILK:
Monique,
it's not safe here anymore.

24:10.825 --> 24:12.034
We got to go.

24:12.076 --> 24:15.580
You swore to me
and to Jesus Christ

24:15.621 --> 24:17.373
that you were done
with Billy Butcher.

24:17.415 --> 24:19.167
I know, I get it.
Everything Butcher touches

24:19.208 --> 24:21.377
-turns to flaming hot shit.
-No, I ain't blaming him.

24:21.419 --> 24:23.171
Last I checked,
you're a grown-ass man.

24:23.212 --> 24:27.008
It's my fault, okay?

24:27.049 --> 24:29.218
But we can't do this right now.

24:29.260 --> 24:31.637
-You put us in danger
without thinking twice, Marvin.
-Monique, just...

24:31.679 --> 24:34.056
Daddy!

24:34.098 --> 24:36.601
Hey, baby, come here.
Give me a hug. Oh.

24:38.019 --> 24:40.688
-What have you been up to?
-I was drawing you a picture.

24:40.730 --> 24:42.732
You were? Can I see?

24:42.773 --> 24:45.776
Oh, my goodness,
this is beautiful.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.570
Thank you, baby.

24:47.612 --> 24:50.072
Janine, honey, Daddy's gonna
take us on a sleepover.

24:50.114 --> 24:52.825
Can you help Mommy
pack your toys?

24:52.867 --> 24:54.660
-Good girl.
-Baby, we're running late.

24:54.702 --> 24:57.246
We don't have time to pack toys.

24:57.288 --> 24:59.081
We got to go.

24:59.123 --> 25:02.501
I knew you'd vote
your conscience, Senator.

25:02.543 --> 25:04.754
Thank you.

25:04.795 --> 25:06.797
Good-bye.

25:08.382 --> 25:10.760
(sighs) Three votes to go.

25:10.801 --> 25:13.179
(laughs)

25:13.221 --> 25:15.181
And the B.A. guys

25:15.223 --> 25:17.475
said that the Pentagon
is shelling out

25:17.516 --> 25:19.810
$35 billion on the low end.

25:19.852 --> 25:23.981
-That puts us ahead of Lockheed.
-Amazing.

25:24.023 --> 25:27.985
That's incredible.
Edgar must be thrilled.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.863
Ugh, fuck Edgar.

25:30.905 --> 25:34.825
We did this, you and me.
This is about us.

25:37.995 --> 25:39.956
Hey, do you remember
that marketing girl?

25:39.997 --> 25:42.291
Ashley?

25:42.333 --> 25:44.168
Um, I'm sorry,
I-I had to fire her, she...

25:44.210 --> 25:48.881
No. No, no, no.
Seven, eight years ago.

25:48.923 --> 25:49.882
Becca.

25:49.924 --> 25:51.968
Becca?

25:52.009 --> 25:53.761
-Yes.
-Becca Butcher.

25:53.803 --> 25:54.929
That's it.

25:54.971 --> 25:58.057
Mm-hmm. Yeah, her.

25:58.099 --> 26:01.644
What about her?

26:01.686 --> 26:04.146
Well, she's missing.

26:04.188 --> 26:06.357
What do you mean, missing?

26:06.399 --> 26:09.068
I mean missing, as in missing,

26:09.110 --> 26:10.778
presumed dead.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.530
-Wow.
-Yeah.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.408
I looked at her file, and
the cops think it was suicide.

26:15.449 --> 26:16.575
Mm.

26:16.617 --> 26:18.953
Yeah, it seems her husband...

26:18.995 --> 26:21.789
Well, he got pretty riled up.

26:21.831 --> 26:23.833
William Butcher.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.088
Am I supposed to know his name?

26:29.130 --> 26:32.925
No. Not specifically, but...

26:32.967 --> 26:37.179
I was just wondering if you knew
what happened to her.

26:37.221 --> 26:39.432
No, I just assumed
that she quit.

26:39.473 --> 26:40.975
Quit?

26:41.017 --> 26:44.687
Is there any particular reason

26:44.729 --> 26:47.189
why you are asking
all of these questions?

26:47.231 --> 26:49.984
No, no. I'm just... curious.

26:50.026 --> 26:52.945
It's interesting, right?
I mean, it's...

26:52.987 --> 26:55.865
Yeah. Yeah, it's definitely sad.

26:55.906 --> 26:57.992
Yeah. Yes, very.

27:00.453 --> 27:02.538
You know, I was, I was
thinking that maybe, um,

27:02.580 --> 27:06.709
I could get Maria to stay late
with the baby and...

27:09.420 --> 27:13.257
...maybe we could
order in and...

27:13.299 --> 27:16.510
catch up. (giggles)
Just me and you.

27:18.554 --> 27:21.766
You know what?
That sounds amazing.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.936
But you go be a mommy.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.188
(pats leg)

27:36.072 --> 27:40.076
I'm telling you,
you're gonna love it here.

27:40.117 --> 27:41.744
You like roller coasters?

27:41.786 --> 27:43.788
I'm more of a water park guy.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.915
Well, Cedar Point's got both.

27:45.956 --> 27:47.958
Mm-hmm.

27:57.385 --> 27:59.178
You first.

27:59.220 --> 28:01.597
(panting):
Huh...?

28:01.639 --> 28:04.892
Oh. Well, most girls
like the suit.

28:04.934 --> 28:08.354
Well, I'm not most girls.

28:08.396 --> 28:11.857
Mm. Is it true what they say?

28:11.899 --> 28:13.859
Come on, baby.

28:13.901 --> 28:16.445
I got you here in the flesh.

28:16.487 --> 28:17.863
I gotta see it.

28:17.905 --> 28:20.199
Please?

28:20.241 --> 28:24.787
I don't, I don't look
like everyone else.

28:24.829 --> 28:27.248
That's what I'm counting on.

28:31.460 --> 28:32.878
All right.

28:34.004 --> 28:35.214
(belt thuds)

28:41.720 --> 28:44.306
(chuckles):
Oh, look at those gills.

28:44.348 --> 28:48.644
(gasps)
Oh, my God, that's so fucked up.

28:48.686 --> 28:52.690
Hey, can-can...
Can we just, uh...

28:52.731 --> 28:54.984
Ah-- be gentle, be gentle.

28:55.025 --> 28:57.153
Ow, it's tender. Oh, God.

28:57.194 --> 29:01.699
Okay. That hurts.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.076
-Stop, stop. Stop, stop, stop.
-Come on, it's just my pinkie.

29:04.118 --> 29:06.704
No, I said it hurt.

29:09.039 --> 29:12.168
All right, look,
I think maybe you should go.

29:12.209 --> 29:14.920
(scoffs)
I'm not going anywhere,

29:14.962 --> 29:16.422
you little fucking freak.

29:17.465 --> 29:20.593
-Lay back.
-(scoffs)

29:20.634 --> 29:22.595
I said, lay back.

29:22.636 --> 29:24.555
Ah. God. Ow!

29:24.597 --> 29:27.683
-Oh, my God. Oh, God.
-(moaning)

29:27.725 --> 29:29.310
-Oh, yeah. You like that?
-Ow.

29:29.351 --> 29:32.563
Oh, you little fucking freak.

29:32.605 --> 29:35.191
Oh, you like getting
your fucking gills fingered?

29:35.232 --> 29:37.860
(grunts)
Ow. Oh, God.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.197
Ow, ow. Oh, God.

29:41.238 --> 29:43.240
(indistinct P.A. announcement)

30:04.386 --> 30:06.138
(screams)

30:07.181 --> 30:09.183
(grunts)

30:43.259 --> 30:45.636
Having a good growler, are we?

30:49.348 --> 30:50.808
How did you...?

30:50.849 --> 30:54.562
I stuck a little bug on you
back at that shithole of yours.

30:54.603 --> 30:57.565
'Cause, you know, fuck you.

30:57.606 --> 30:58.941
No...

30:58.983 --> 31:00.359
What did you expect me to do?

31:00.401 --> 31:01.986
It was Homelander.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.323
(echoes):
You got to talk to me.

31:08.325 --> 31:12.204
(panting):
Wait, wait. No. I can help you.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.541
Becca?

31:19.128 --> 31:20.588
(whimpers)

31:22.298 --> 31:24.341
Your wife.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.343
'Cause she's missing?

31:26.385 --> 31:28.596
I can help you find her.

31:51.994 --> 31:53.996
(panting)

31:56.957 --> 31:58.917
Please, I have a daughter!

31:58.959 --> 32:00.544
No!

32:06.550 --> 32:08.552
(panting)

32:19.813 --> 32:21.523
(doorbell rings)

32:22.816 --> 32:24.818
Don't want none, fuck off.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.862
I'm here about your wife.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.491
I believe this was a few days

32:30.532 --> 32:34.828
after you met Homelander
at that Christmas party?

32:44.588 --> 32:47.424
She was alone with him
for three hours.

33:04.441 --> 33:06.819
Not long after that,
Rebecca went missing

33:06.860 --> 33:09.029
and has remained so ever since.

33:09.071 --> 33:11.240
One way or another, Mr. Butcher,

33:11.281 --> 33:13.325
I believe Homelander
was involved.

33:13.367 --> 33:15.744
Homelander?

33:17.830 --> 33:19.832
But he's a fucking superhero.

33:21.417 --> 33:23.836
You wouldn't believe
what they get up to.

33:28.632 --> 33:30.634
Who the fuck are you?

33:32.720 --> 33:35.514
My name is Mallory.

33:35.556 --> 33:39.601
I'm the person
who can get you payback.

33:43.355 --> 33:46.692
(ringing)

33:52.573 --> 33:56.368
Who's calling?

33:56.410 --> 33:59.121
(sniffles)
Nobody.

34:03.834 --> 34:07.838
(sighs)
Listen, if you...

34:07.880 --> 34:12.593
if you want to talk,
I suppose we...

34:12.634 --> 34:14.636
No.

34:16.680 --> 34:19.475
But would it kill you
to make me one of those?

34:19.516 --> 34:21.518
(chuckles)

34:25.647 --> 34:29.026
You know, I had someone once.

34:29.067 --> 34:32.905
We were gonna get away,
start a family.

34:33.947 --> 34:35.949
So what happened?

34:35.991 --> 34:38.952
(chuckles)

34:38.994 --> 34:40.788
Well...

34:40.829 --> 34:44.041
Everyone always asks,

34:44.082 --> 34:47.669
what's our special weakness?

34:47.711 --> 34:49.087
Gamma rays?

34:49.129 --> 34:51.548
Iron daggers?

34:51.590 --> 34:55.135
Some ridiculous, stupid thing?

34:56.386 --> 34:58.764
The truth is,

34:58.806 --> 35:03.310
our weakness
is the same as anyone's.

35:03.352 --> 35:05.354
It's people.

35:06.396 --> 35:09.399
The people we care about.

35:09.441 --> 35:13.403
So I say, cut them loose.

35:13.445 --> 35:16.615
For your good and for theirs.

35:16.657 --> 35:20.118
That way
you're really bulletproof.

35:42.516 --> 35:44.685
What's up, man?

35:44.726 --> 35:47.980
How'd you end up here?

35:48.021 --> 35:50.190
Oh, tell me about it.

35:50.232 --> 35:52.651
(sighs)
Me, too.

35:54.987 --> 35:56.780
What's that?

35:56.822 --> 35:58.824
Oh.

35:58.866 --> 36:02.035
Wait, you can't get
in your head about that.

36:02.077 --> 36:04.496
It's really not
that big of a deal.

36:04.538 --> 36:06.707
I'm gonna get you out of here.

36:06.748 --> 36:08.959
Just hang tight.

36:12.713 --> 36:15.382
Excuse me, sir.

36:15.424 --> 36:18.302
Oh, hey. Can I take one of these
lobsters back with me?

36:18.343 --> 36:20.554
-You got it.
-Thanks.

36:25.684 --> 36:28.770
Oh, wait, no, no, no, no.
Not that one.

36:28.812 --> 36:29.813
This one.

36:29.855 --> 36:31.273
Yeah, that's my guy.

36:31.315 --> 36:32.524
(chuckles)

36:40.073 --> 36:42.117
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

36:43.911 --> 36:45.871
FRENCHIE:
Larry, please.

36:45.913 --> 36:48.332
I just need a secure place
for a few nights.

36:48.373 --> 36:50.250
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

36:50.292 --> 36:52.294
Putain!

36:54.171 --> 36:56.131
(sighs)

36:56.173 --> 36:57.883
STARLIGHT:
Hi, you've reached Annie.

36:57.925 --> 36:59.635
-I can't come to the phone...
-Oh, damn it.

36:59.676 --> 37:02.554
(cartoon playing on computer)

37:02.596 --> 37:04.556
That's Hughie, baby.

37:05.599 --> 37:07.726
-She looks like you.
-Nah.

37:07.768 --> 37:10.020
She's good-looking, man.

37:10.062 --> 37:12.147
Right, baby? (chuckles)

37:26.119 --> 37:28.080
Mr. Campbell.

37:28.121 --> 37:29.623
Ooh, yeah.

37:29.665 --> 37:32.376
Pleasure to meet you.
Billy Butcher.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.878
Oh, Hugh Campbell.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.756
-You got a hell of a lad there.
-Well, yeah.

37:37.798 --> 37:39.800
He's all mine.

37:41.134 --> 37:43.053
Hello, hello, hello.

37:43.095 --> 37:46.390
What have we got here, then, eh?

37:46.431 --> 37:48.183
What's your name, sweetheart?

37:48.225 --> 37:50.018
You can call me Uncle Billy.

37:50.060 --> 37:52.062
He ain't your uncle, honey.

37:54.564 --> 37:57.275
-He ain't nothing to you.
-Monique.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.904
Good to see you.

38:09.413 --> 38:11.248
Hi, you've reached Annie.
I can't come

38:11.289 --> 38:13.291
to the phone right now...

38:14.626 --> 38:16.461
(clears throat)

38:17.462 --> 38:19.297
(whispers):
What's she doing?

38:19.339 --> 38:23.010
Uh, okay. It's okay.

38:23.051 --> 38:25.012
It's okay.

38:26.638 --> 38:27.848
Does the Oriental girl not talk?

38:27.889 --> 38:29.433
Uh, Asian.

38:29.474 --> 38:30.642
-Yeah.
-You're right. Asian.

38:30.684 --> 38:32.686
And no, I don't think she does.

38:34.563 --> 38:36.606
Dad, I'm really sorry.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.650
I'm sorry about everything.

38:38.692 --> 38:41.403
No, no, no. Don't say sorry. No.

38:41.445 --> 38:44.865
Look at you,
standing up for yourself.

38:44.906 --> 38:46.408
Jings.

38:46.450 --> 38:48.660
(both chuckle)

38:48.702 --> 38:50.704
(pats knee)

38:53.832 --> 38:55.417
Cold feet, huh?

38:55.459 --> 38:56.835
What?

38:56.877 --> 38:58.253
You said Raynor got cold feet.

38:58.295 --> 38:59.921
Yeah, that's what I said.

38:59.963 --> 39:02.466
You know what I think it is?

39:02.507 --> 39:04.760
I think
Raynor's plenty interested,

39:04.801 --> 39:08.346
only she didn't bring you
Homelander's head on a plate,

39:08.388 --> 39:10.557
and you blew
the whole fucking thing up.

39:10.599 --> 39:12.059
How am I doing so far?

39:12.100 --> 39:14.227
No, mate. Way off.

39:14.269 --> 39:16.855
Bullshit, Butcher.

39:16.897 --> 39:19.983
You're so hot for Homelander
right now, Butcher,

39:20.025 --> 39:22.319
you're not gonna let anything
get in your way,

39:22.360 --> 39:25.238
even if it's
your own fucking friends, man.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.741
You promised me
things would be different.

39:27.783 --> 39:29.785
Matter of fact, you swore it.

39:29.826 --> 39:32.788
But this is worse, man.

39:32.829 --> 39:35.207
This is gonna be
Mallory's family all over again,

39:35.248 --> 39:37.501
only this time
it's gonna be my family.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.920
And if something happens
to them, Butcher...

39:48.428 --> 39:50.597
I don't know what happened
with you and Raynor

39:50.639 --> 39:53.058
or how that situation
got fucked up,

39:53.100 --> 39:55.435
but just please call her.

39:55.477 --> 39:57.646
Please.

40:01.858 --> 40:04.694
(dogs barking)

40:06.029 --> 40:08.031
(dog whines)

40:08.073 --> 40:09.658
Yeah.

40:09.699 --> 40:11.827
-(whooshing, thud)
-There you go.

40:13.870 --> 40:16.206
Dr. Vogelbaum.

40:21.503 --> 40:23.922
Surprise.

40:23.964 --> 40:26.383
Thought I'd drop in on you.

40:27.384 --> 40:29.344
You look well.

40:29.386 --> 40:31.388
How long's it been, John?

40:31.429 --> 40:35.308
(chuckles) Long enough that
no one calls me John anymore.

40:35.350 --> 40:37.435
Mm.

40:39.479 --> 40:42.899
So, what are these? Uh... pets?

40:42.941 --> 40:44.901
No, just breeding them.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.611
German retrievers.

40:47.654 --> 40:50.240
I try not to get
too attached to my subjects.

40:51.283 --> 40:53.577
Hmm. Well, that's true.

40:56.246 --> 40:58.081
Seems retirement suits you.

40:59.708 --> 41:03.003
Between this
and 80-hour weeks at the lab,

41:03.044 --> 41:05.630
I'll take the lab. No contest.

41:08.258 --> 41:10.302
So, you ever, uh...

41:10.343 --> 41:12.637
catch up with any
of the old gang from Vought?

41:12.679 --> 41:14.264
(chuckles)

41:14.306 --> 41:15.891
Look, do you mind
if we don't do this?

41:15.932 --> 41:18.894
-Do what?
-This cat and mouse bullshit.

41:18.935 --> 41:21.188
You want to know
about Rebecca Butcher.

41:21.229 --> 41:23.023
You went to Stillwell
about it because you knew

41:23.064 --> 41:25.150
that'd tip over
the first domino.

41:25.192 --> 41:26.860
Well, it led to me.

41:30.030 --> 41:31.448
So just ask.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.283
I'll be honest.

41:37.078 --> 41:38.830
Well, that would be a first.

41:41.458 --> 41:43.793
Eight years ago...

41:43.835 --> 41:46.922
Stillwell called me with quite
an interesting challenge.

41:49.049 --> 41:51.718
Rebecca Butcher
had come to her with a...

41:51.760 --> 41:54.679
completely unprecedented
medical condition.

41:55.972 --> 41:57.682
What condition?

42:02.270 --> 42:04.356
VOGELBAUM:
She was pregnant.

42:04.397 --> 42:06.441
With your child.

42:09.819 --> 42:11.655
Pregnant?

42:13.949 --> 42:15.492
Wh...

42:17.327 --> 42:20.789
(stammering):
But I thought I couldn't.

42:20.830 --> 42:22.707
So did I.

42:22.749 --> 42:24.793
Apparently, nature is tenacious.

42:24.834 --> 42:28.755
The fetus was developing
unnaturally fast.

42:28.797 --> 42:30.966
We told her we'd deliver
the baby safely

42:31.007 --> 42:32.509
at a secure location,

42:32.550 --> 42:34.135
but she had to sign an NDA.

42:34.177 --> 42:35.679
Couldn't tell anyone.

42:36.721 --> 42:39.099
Not even her husband.

42:39.140 --> 42:41.851
You can imagine the size
of the potential scandal.

42:41.893 --> 42:44.354
(nurses' voices echoing)

42:44.396 --> 42:45.563
BECCA:
No!

42:45.605 --> 42:48.316
No! Pull it out--
Oh, my--

42:48.358 --> 42:50.527
(screaming)

42:52.028 --> 42:54.030
(wailing)

42:55.949 --> 42:57.867
The birth was difficult.

42:59.869 --> 43:01.538
The baby clawed its way
out of her.

43:03.415 --> 43:05.917
The blood loss...
no one could have survived.

43:07.210 --> 43:08.795
She died on the table.

43:10.588 --> 43:12.048
A-And the baby?

43:12.090 --> 43:14.092
Lived all of ten seconds.

43:14.134 --> 43:17.012
Drowned in its mother's blood.

43:20.390 --> 43:22.392
Was it a boy?

43:22.434 --> 43:25.020
Does it matter?

43:26.062 --> 43:28.064
Why didn't you tell me?

43:28.106 --> 43:30.066
To protect you.

43:30.108 --> 43:33.528
That's always job one
at Vought, isn't it?

43:33.570 --> 43:36.364
Protect our
most profitable asset?

43:38.658 --> 43:40.702
So why are you telling me now?

43:40.744 --> 43:42.746
You don't understand.

43:45.040 --> 43:47.751
The thing about
cross-breeding dogs,

43:47.792 --> 43:49.753
you get the right genes,

43:49.794 --> 43:51.588
you can get a perfect creation.

43:51.629 --> 43:54.132
But it doesn't matter
how perfect they are.

43:54.174 --> 43:57.427
It's not enough.

43:57.469 --> 43:59.471
When I raise subjects
without their mothers,

43:59.512 --> 44:00.889
they become violent.

44:00.930 --> 44:03.600
Aggressive.

44:03.641 --> 44:05.643
Downright hateful.

44:08.646 --> 44:10.065
You should have been raised

44:10.106 --> 44:12.108
in a home with a family
who loved you.

44:12.150 --> 44:15.779
Not in a cold lab with doctors.

44:15.820 --> 44:18.323
And yet, I turned out great.

44:18.365 --> 44:21.034
(scoffs) When I think
what it's done to you,

44:21.076 --> 44:24.579
and what you can now do
to everyone else...

44:24.621 --> 44:26.623
(exhales)

44:30.502 --> 44:32.545
I'm sorry.

44:33.922 --> 44:35.673
I don't want
your fucking apology.

44:35.715 --> 44:37.634
All this is my fault.

44:37.675 --> 44:40.387
What do you want?

44:40.428 --> 44:42.889
What?

44:44.682 --> 44:47.060
What do you want-- forgiveness?

44:47.102 --> 44:49.104
Now?

44:51.231 --> 44:53.900
After you raised me
like a fucking lab rat?

44:57.987 --> 44:59.989
No.

45:01.574 --> 45:03.993
Too little, too late.

45:06.329 --> 45:08.331
I don't want anything
from you, John.

45:09.999 --> 45:12.627
I'm just an old man,
thinking about his mistakes.

45:13.711 --> 45:15.713
(sighs)

45:17.298 --> 45:20.635
I'm the world's greatest
superhero.

45:22.512 --> 45:24.639
You're my greatest failure.

45:30.395 --> 45:32.730
(line ringing)

45:32.772 --> 45:34.899
STARLIGHT:
Hi. You've reached Annie.

45:34.941 --> 45:36.901
I can't come
to the phone right now, but...

45:36.943 --> 45:38.445
(vehicle approaching)

45:38.486 --> 45:40.488
(tires squealing)

45:42.532 --> 45:44.617
-(tires squealing)
-Merde!

45:46.786 --> 45:48.163
Butcher.

45:48.204 --> 45:49.998
-Yeah, yeah, here's a gun.
-Fucking hell.

45:50.039 --> 45:51.666
Calm down.

45:51.708 --> 45:54.252
-Okay, come on.
-(gun chamber clicking)

46:02.760 --> 46:04.721
All right, easy, lads. Easy.

46:04.762 --> 46:06.264
(radio crackles)

46:06.306 --> 46:08.016
M.M.

46:08.057 --> 46:09.934
Deputy Director.

46:09.976 --> 46:11.811
Your family's gonna be okay,
you have my word.

46:11.853 --> 46:13.354
Thank you.

46:17.859 --> 46:19.944
You called?

46:19.986 --> 46:21.529
You are a human after all.

46:21.571 --> 46:23.948
Well, let's not get
too carried away.

46:23.990 --> 46:25.366
Thanks, man.

46:25.408 --> 46:27.410
AGENT:
Come right this way, ma'am.

46:32.457 --> 46:34.417
Monique, I'm sorry.

46:34.459 --> 46:36.544
I never want to see you again,
Marvin.

46:38.630 --> 46:40.798
Come here, baby.

46:40.840 --> 46:42.967
Mmm.

46:43.009 --> 46:44.844
Daddy loves you, okay?

46:44.886 --> 46:46.888
You're gonna be safe with Mommy.

46:46.930 --> 46:48.932
All right? All right.

46:53.728 --> 46:55.188
(sighs)

46:58.107 --> 47:00.193
Take care of yourself.

47:00.235 --> 47:02.237
All right. All right.

47:10.828 --> 47:12.789
-No Homelander.
-No Homelander.

47:12.830 --> 47:15.291
We had a deal.
Everyone else is fair game.

47:15.333 --> 47:17.502
Do you want this or not?

47:36.521 --> 47:38.565
(phone buzzing)

47:48.074 --> 47:50.201
Annie, are you okay?

47:50.243 --> 47:52.579
(sniffles)

47:52.620 --> 47:54.622
I have to see you.

47:55.957 --> 47:57.917
I, uh...

47:57.959 --> 48:00.044
I don't know. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

48:00.086 --> 48:01.838
You have to explain, Hughie.

48:01.879 --> 48:03.840
You have
to make this make sense.

48:03.881 --> 48:05.717
Just you and me.

48:07.260 --> 48:09.262
You owe me that much.

48:11.806 --> 48:13.766
MADELYN:
I'm sorry.

48:13.808 --> 48:15.685
I'm afraid I'm not following.

48:15.727 --> 48:18.563
You and your corporation
are fucked.

48:18.605 --> 48:22.859
Unequivocally,
unilaterally fucked.

48:22.900 --> 48:25.695
How was that?
Is that clearer for you?

48:28.781 --> 48:30.742
For the last half century,

48:30.783 --> 48:33.953
you have been feeding
the American people the line

48:33.995 --> 48:37.248
that your superheroes
are chosen by God.

48:43.630 --> 48:45.506
I mean, I get it.

48:45.548 --> 48:47.300
Jamming illegal drugs
into babies' arms--

48:47.342 --> 48:49.802
I mean, that doesn't quite
have the same ring,

48:49.844 --> 48:51.721
and that's not even the worst.

48:53.014 --> 48:55.516
What did you do
to this one, and why?

48:55.558 --> 48:58.227
I've never seen her
in my entire life.

48:58.269 --> 48:59.896
Uh-huh.

48:59.937 --> 49:02.106
-What do you want?
-For starters,

49:02.148 --> 49:04.984
there are no superheroes
in the U.S. Armed Forces.

49:05.026 --> 49:07.111
The bill's already gone down
to the floor.

49:07.153 --> 49:09.322
They're gonna vote on it
any day now.

49:09.364 --> 49:10.907
And you're pulling it.

49:10.948 --> 49:13.493
Retooling the concept
for internal development.

49:13.534 --> 49:15.703
I don't give a shit,
but the deal is dead.

49:15.745 --> 49:18.122
And we're gonna go
back to status quo,

49:18.164 --> 49:20.124
where we're the government
and the military,

49:20.166 --> 49:23.670
and you're just assholes
running around in your capes.

49:23.711 --> 49:26.214
-And if we refuse?
-Everything goes public.

49:26.255 --> 49:28.049
Corruption story of the century.

49:28.091 --> 49:29.509
Vought shares go to zero.

49:29.550 --> 49:31.928
The civil suits,
criminal prosecution,

49:31.969 --> 49:33.888
and you go bankrupt,
and your cute

49:33.930 --> 49:38.476
little suit goes to a lovely
shade of orange for 15 to 30.

49:39.644 --> 49:41.604
-(door opens)
-WOMAN: Ms. Raynor?

49:42.730 --> 49:44.732
Thank you, Michaela.

49:48.403 --> 49:50.988
We're done here.

49:52.031 --> 49:53.700
Everything okay, I hope?

49:53.741 --> 49:56.202
(door closes)

49:57.995 --> 50:00.289
Someone tell me
what the hell is going on.

50:00.331 --> 50:02.709
About 12 minutes ago,
Navy SEALs took out Abu Ressam

50:02.750 --> 50:04.419
about 15 miles
outside of Damascus.

50:04.460 --> 50:07.922
Right, as planned.
So what's the problem?

50:07.964 --> 50:09.632
Watch.

50:09.674 --> 50:11.634
-(gunfire, woman screams)
-(indistinct shouting)

50:11.676 --> 50:14.178
-MAN: We got two.
-(man yells)

50:14.220 --> 50:17.181
-MAN 2: Nice eye.
-MAN 3: Stop.

50:17.223 --> 50:19.976
That's our guy. Light him up.

50:20.017 --> 50:21.686
Great.

50:21.728 --> 50:24.605
The prick behind Flight 37
is dead. What am I missing?

50:24.647 --> 50:26.941
-Just wait.
-(beeps)

50:30.111 --> 50:32.405
-Step inside.
-Watch this.

50:32.447 --> 50:34.490
(woman whimpering,
glass clinking)

50:34.532 --> 50:36.075
(debris clinking)

50:36.117 --> 50:38.703
-We got movement!
-Hey! Hey! Get down!

50:38.745 --> 50:40.204
-Hey!
-Get down!

50:40.246 --> 50:42.165
-Get down, motherfucker!
-Don't fucking move!

50:42.206 --> 50:44.584
I said get down!

50:44.625 --> 50:46.085
What the fuck does that say?

50:46.127 --> 50:48.212
"Naqib."

50:48.254 --> 50:50.047
MAN:
Hey!

50:50.089 --> 50:51.841
Freeze, motherfucker!

50:51.883 --> 50:54.135
-Kill him!
-(rapid gunfire)

51:08.024 --> 51:10.026
That's not all.

51:22.371 --> 51:24.999
How is that son of a bitch
still alive?

51:27.668 --> 51:29.462
"Naqib" means "Captain."

51:29.504 --> 51:31.380
We believe it's his...

51:31.422 --> 51:33.424
Supe name.

51:41.933 --> 51:44.811
Are you telling me

51:44.852 --> 51:47.939
they have a Supe terrorist?

52:08.209 --> 52:10.169
Look, Annie, I-I...

52:10.211 --> 52:12.129
Did you kill Translucent?

52:14.006 --> 52:16.008
It's-it's...
it's not that simple.

52:17.718 --> 52:20.388
And you haven't been using me
to get back at A-Train?

52:27.019 --> 52:29.021
(Annie sighs)

52:33.860 --> 52:35.236
Y...

52:35.278 --> 52:36.821
You're a murderer.

52:36.863 --> 52:38.698
We didn't have a choice.

52:38.739 --> 52:41.075
-There is always a choice.
-Wait.

52:41.117 --> 52:42.785
Aah. What-what are you doing?

52:42.827 --> 52:45.037
-I'm taking you in.
-What-- No. Annie, hold on.

52:45.079 --> 52:47.123
To the cops! At least
they'll treat you better

52:47.164 --> 52:48.666
-than The Seven would.
-Just listen to me.

52:48.708 --> 52:50.668
Listen to me, okay?
I know this is so fucked.

52:50.710 --> 52:52.962
You were the only thing, Hughie.

52:53.004 --> 52:54.714
You were the only thing
that I could count on.

52:54.755 --> 52:56.465
I'm still me, Annie.

52:56.507 --> 52:58.885
Please. You know me.

52:58.926 --> 53:00.887
I don't know you.

53:00.928 --> 53:03.598
-Never did.
-If you bring me in,

53:03.639 --> 53:05.308
-I'm dead before sunrise.
-No.

53:05.349 --> 53:08.144
Vought will want to string
you up for a long trial.

53:08.185 --> 53:10.146
Lots of press.
The guy who killed Translucent.

53:10.187 --> 53:12.106
This isn't about Translucent.

53:12.148 --> 53:14.358
Okay? This is about Compound V.

53:14.400 --> 53:16.819
(both panting)

53:16.861 --> 53:19.238
Compound V?

53:21.532 --> 53:23.701
It's this drug.

53:23.743 --> 53:26.454
It, um...

53:26.495 --> 53:28.873
It gives the Supes their powers.

53:30.124 --> 53:32.168
Vought will do anything
to cover it up.

53:32.209 --> 53:35.046
N... No. What? Wha...?

53:35.087 --> 53:37.089
What are you talking about?

53:38.883 --> 53:40.885
We're born like this.

53:42.637 --> 53:44.639
I'm so sorry.

53:47.475 --> 53:48.476
Annie. Annie.

53:48.517 --> 53:50.102
-Annie, watch out!
-(screams)

53:50.144 --> 53:52.688
-(people shrieking)
-Fucking run, Hughie.

53:53.439 --> 53:55.232
(groaning)

53:58.653 --> 54:00.321
-(screams)
-(panting)

54:00.363 --> 54:03.157
-I'm so sorry.
-(panting)

54:03.199 --> 54:05.576
Get the fuck away from her!

54:08.913 --> 54:10.957
What the fuck were you thinking,
coming here?

54:10.998 --> 54:12.541
I didn't ask for your help.

54:12.583 --> 54:14.335
Yeah. Looked like
you had it all under control.

54:14.377 --> 54:16.712
-(grunting)
-(sirens blaring)

54:16.754 --> 54:18.172
(groaning)

54:18.214 --> 54:20.216
(gasping)
