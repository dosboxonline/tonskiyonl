00:01.001 --> 00:03.002
[cheering and screaming]

00:09.134 --> 00:10.552
Oh, my goodness.

00:11.678 --> 00:12.554
I love you too.

00:12.637 --> 00:14.305
[screaming continues]

00:14.681 --> 00:16.558
See you at the match on Sunday!

00:16.641 --> 00:18.309
-You're too kind.
-[Stella] Sam!

00:18.893 --> 00:22.063
-What's your relationship to Razmik Maier?
-Already did the presser.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.441
My dad says you're too old
to win against Grishov.

00:24.524 --> 00:27.569
Hope your pops didn't bet the house
or you'll be sleeping in a tent.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.029
How are you so sure?

00:29.112 --> 00:31.489
One word, my guy. Practice.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.283
Are you working with the doctor?

00:33.867 --> 00:35.827
Do you know who else he's working with?

00:35.910 --> 00:37.620
-Sam!
-All right. Hey, hey.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.831
-Thanks.
-You know who else he's working with?

00:39.914 --> 00:41.041
-Sam.
-Hey.

00:41.791 --> 00:43.752
[dramatic music playing]

00:43.835 --> 00:45.003
She knows. That reporter.

00:45.086 --> 00:48.882
I don't know how. It's only a matter
of time before everyone else does.

00:48.965 --> 00:51.509
She's persistent, but unimportant.

00:51.593 --> 00:55.764
What matters is you and the goals
you are close to accomplishing.

00:55.847 --> 00:57.223
She is a reporter.

00:57.307 --> 00:58.892
She's one reporter.

00:58.975 --> 01:02.437
Everyone else thinks
you're aging like fine wine.

01:02.520 --> 01:05.523
Aging like fine wine is fine for wine,
but when you're a pro,

01:05.607 --> 01:07.734
-people ask questions.
-Let them.

01:07.817 --> 01:09.527
You've never failed a drug test,

01:09.611 --> 01:10.904
and with me,

01:11.404 --> 01:12.864
you never will.

01:13.531 --> 01:17.035
We've talked about this.
You know how uncomfortable it makes me.

01:17.619 --> 01:18.703
Besides, I feel good.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.246
I'm winning.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.290
I want you to keep winning.

01:23.374 --> 01:26.127
My dad is gonna be here any minute,
so you cannot be here.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.630
I'm sure Ken's happy you made the finals.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.591
He'll be even happier when you win.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.887
Come. We have work to do.

01:46.105 --> 01:46.940
Good.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.903
Now close your eyes.

01:51.986 --> 01:53.780
Visualize the match.

01:53.863 --> 01:55.281
What you need to do to win.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.450
To be the best there is.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.995
The best there ever will be.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.084
Sammy?

02:07.335 --> 02:09.337
Sammy, it's Dad.

02:09.921 --> 02:11.005
Yo, Sam!

02:11.089 --> 02:12.924
[ominous music playing]

02:14.134 --> 02:15.385
Come on, sleepyhead.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.386
Up and at them.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.185
[inaudible dialogue]

02:25.687 --> 02:27.147
No!

02:28.148 --> 02:29.399
Sam!

02:29.482 --> 02:30.733
My boy.

02:31.734 --> 02:33.027
Sam!

02:47.417 --> 02:48.376
What's this?

02:48.459 --> 02:49.544
Proof that I'm innocent.

02:49.627 --> 02:51.087
I took a blood test.

02:51.170 --> 02:52.630
The lab misplaced the results.

02:52.714 --> 02:55.258
I didn't wanna draw attention
by getting another,

02:55.341 --> 02:56.968
so I couldn't confirm until now.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.136
You were drugged.

02:58.219 --> 02:59.554
GHB.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.347
Explains why you can't remember.

03:01.431 --> 03:04.475
Perfect drug to give someone you're trying
to frame for the perfect murder.

03:04.559 --> 03:05.435
Yeah.

03:05.518 --> 03:08.479
The homicide detective, Heber,
you show this to him?

03:08.563 --> 03:10.315
I didn't. I can't.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.525
Why not? This proves you're innocent.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.570
Remember when you worked magic
on my service weapon

03:15.653 --> 03:17.947
to make it look like
it wasn't used to kill Doug?

03:18.031 --> 03:22.035
-We ran ballistics. We know the truth.
-But they don't. And they never will.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.871
We were being watched.

03:28.583 --> 03:29.709
[groans]

03:30.501 --> 03:32.420
Coop, you gotta tell Heber.

03:32.503 --> 03:35.131
Whoever killed Doug knows
that you tampered with evidence.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.133
I know because he called me.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.427
-What does he want?
-I don't know. He wants something.

03:39.510 --> 03:42.222
Because I roped you and Charlene
into a cover up,

03:42.305 --> 03:44.390
he thinks he's got the leverage
to get me to do it.

03:44.474 --> 03:45.892
Any idea who it is?

03:45.975 --> 03:47.018
None.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.646
Only way to get us
out of the hole I've dug...

03:50.438 --> 03:52.398
is to find out who he is
and prove what he's done.

03:52.482 --> 03:55.026
Once we do that, then we go to the cops.

03:56.569 --> 03:57.904
Where do we start?

03:59.864 --> 04:01.157
[Mierce] Is everything all right?

04:01.824 --> 04:02.867
Are you expecting a call?

04:02.951 --> 04:06.079
This belonged to the man
who shot Elizabeth.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.748
Why do you have it?

04:08.831 --> 04:11.960
That night,
when everything was falling apart...

04:12.585 --> 04:17.632
I guess muscle memory or instinct told me
to have a guy get it from the morgue.

04:17.715 --> 04:19.050
In case there were...

04:19.884 --> 04:20.969
loose ends.

04:21.052 --> 04:22.595
-I see.
-Yes.

04:22.679 --> 04:23.680
I know you do.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.181
I see what you're doing.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.391
I'm less clear why.

04:26.474 --> 04:30.728
I now know Dembe gave Elizabeth
that letter before she died.

04:30.812 --> 04:31.938
In the past two years,

04:32.021 --> 04:35.233
I've never really asked any questions
about what happened.

04:35.316 --> 04:36.943
And now you are.

04:38.945 --> 04:41.739
My young friend, Tadashi,
will be coming in an hour.

04:41.823 --> 04:42.657
I want you to...

04:44.158 --> 04:45.159
give this to him.

04:45.243 --> 04:50.456
I've asked him to hack into and pull
the phone's GPS history from that day.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.416
That night.

04:51.499 --> 04:54.836
Once I know where the killer went,
I'll know if there's more to the story.

04:54.919 --> 04:58.298
If you look hard enough,
you'll find there's more to every story.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.550
But that doesn't mean you should.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.343
[cell phone buzzing]

05:05.972 --> 05:08.641
It's your present
that demands your attention,

05:08.725 --> 05:10.143
not your past.

05:10.226 --> 05:11.519
You're right, Mierce.

05:11.602 --> 05:13.855
But please give it to him anyway.

05:13.938 --> 05:15.023
Harold.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.651
Missed your call.
Sorry for the back-and-forth.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.863
That's why I was calling, actually.
Back-and-forth.

05:21.946 --> 05:24.449
What do you know
about professional tennis?

05:24.532 --> 05:25.533
Sam Rhode.

05:25.616 --> 05:28.202
Number eight in the world. Thirty-six.

05:28.286 --> 05:31.372
He was playing the best tennis
of his career. Now he's dead.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.374
There's rumors he was juicing.
Now we know.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.751
Not according to Reddington.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.336
The ME said Rhode OD'd
on a synthetic oxygen carrier

05:37.420 --> 05:40.339
designed to increase stamina.
It gave him a heart attack instead.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.468
ME's focused on how Rhode died, not why.

05:43.551 --> 05:47.138
Reddington says the why involves this man,
Dr. Razmik Maier.

05:47.221 --> 05:49.974
A German pharmacologist
whispered to be responsible

05:50.058 --> 05:52.643
for keeping two generations
of world-class athletes

05:52.727 --> 05:54.062
a step ahead of WADA.

05:54.145 --> 05:57.106
Giving East Germans steroids
during the Cold War,

05:57.190 --> 05:59.317
EPO to U.S. cyclists in the '90s,

05:59.400 --> 06:03.529
and hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers
to the Russian Federation in 2014.

06:03.613 --> 06:06.282
If Maier devoted his career
to helping athletes win,

06:06.365 --> 06:08.743
and if they were his clients,

06:08.826 --> 06:10.369
why would he suddenly want to kill one?

06:10.453 --> 06:12.830
That's what his biggest client
wants him to do.

06:12.914 --> 06:15.333
Who's bigger than the 8th ranked player?

06:15.416 --> 06:17.085
[Raymond] <i>The Boswell Syndicate.</i>

06:17.168 --> 06:21.422
A family-run sportsbook
catering to the decidedly criminal element

06:21.506 --> 06:25.551
who are unable or unwilling
to satisfy their predilection

06:25.635 --> 06:29.222
in the betting parlors of Vegas,
Macao or Monaco.

06:29.305 --> 06:30.890
And Maier is in business with them?

06:30.973 --> 06:34.477
Rumor has it the Boswells,
James and Junior,

06:34.560 --> 06:39.440
pay Dr. Maier a significant fee
in exchange for inside information:

06:39.524 --> 06:42.360
<i>who's doping,</i>
<i>where they are in their cycle.</i>

06:42.443 --> 06:44.946
Insider information is one thing.
Murder's another.

06:45.029 --> 06:48.783
Generation ago, the Boswells
controlled the nation's sportsbook.

06:48.866 --> 06:52.245
Betting on sports has exploded since then.
Casinos. Online.

06:52.328 --> 06:54.747
Three years ago,
the Supreme Court struck down laws

06:54.831 --> 06:57.125
prohibiting states
from authorizing sports betting.

06:57.208 --> 07:01.420
As a result, the Boswells' once hefty
profit margins all but evaporated.

07:01.504 --> 07:04.006
<i>To retain business, they cut their vig.</i>

07:04.090 --> 07:09.178
But their ability to survive an outcome
that exposed them to large losses

07:09.262 --> 07:10.763
was terribly compromised.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.433
So instead of putting
a finger on the scale,

07:13.516 --> 07:16.185
I'm told they enlist their German friend

07:16.269 --> 07:19.397
to put the full weight
of everything he knows on it.

07:19.480 --> 07:23.109
Supposedly, Dr. Maier still provides
the Boswells inside information.

07:23.192 --> 07:25.236
But in what Reddington says
are a few select cases,

07:25.319 --> 07:29.866
he accidentally overdoses a player
whose performance might wipe them out.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.702
Players like Sam Rhode
who were already working with Maier,

07:32.785 --> 07:35.830
so it was easy to make
the murder look accidental.

07:35.913 --> 07:39.041
Aram, review Reddington's theory
with the ME,

07:39.125 --> 07:40.168
see if it holds up.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.753
Ressler, Park, talk to Rhode's parents.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.755
See if they know anything about Maier.

07:45.840 --> 07:49.552
Reddington's gonna take the lead
with the Boswells and asked you to join.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.429
-Did he say why?
-He did not.

07:51.512 --> 07:54.098
Maybe he wants to talk about
the good old days?

07:55.308 --> 07:57.226
So you went to visit Liz.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.144
How was that?

07:58.227 --> 08:00.188
It was good. Long overdue.

08:00.771 --> 08:02.773
What I mean is,
I know you're still struggling,

08:02.857 --> 08:05.067
and I'm hoping that going
to the cemetery...

08:05.151 --> 08:07.612
-I'm hoping it helped.
-It did.

08:07.695 --> 08:10.823
I thought it was gonna have
the opposite effect, but I'm good.

08:10.907 --> 08:11.991
I'm--

08:12.074 --> 08:14.410
The fancy word for it is "titrating."

08:14.494 --> 08:16.078
I'm weaning myself off.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.497
It's hard, but, uh...

08:18.164 --> 08:20.333
the light at the end
of the proverbial tunnel?

08:20.416 --> 08:21.751
I can see it now.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.294
And I can see your face.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.213
I'm glad you shaved.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.341
I'll take it as a sign
you've got nothing to hide.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.305
Ani, got a sec?

08:34.388 --> 08:36.766
No. I don't. Definitely not for you.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.977
-Any comment on Sam Rhode?
-I told you to stop contacting me.

08:40.061 --> 08:43.272
Tell me what you know
before someone else accidentally dies.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.690
I'm not gonna tell you again.

08:44.774 --> 08:45.900
Leave me alone.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.568
Or I will call the police.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.403
Is winning that important to you?

08:50.196 --> 08:51.822
That you'd cover for Maier?

08:52.990 --> 08:54.534
I'm not gonna tell you again.

08:54.617 --> 08:55.493
[Stella] Ani!

08:56.160 --> 08:57.203
Ani, come on.

08:59.288 --> 09:01.165
You have too many questions.

09:08.464 --> 09:11.259
I know about the letter.
That you showed it to Elizabeth.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.263
It made her happy.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.098
And hours later she was dead.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.475
All the more reason to have told her.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.520
Unless telling her
is one of the reasons why she died.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.522
What does that mean?

09:27.441 --> 09:28.317
Hey.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.027
Hey, Stella.

09:30.111 --> 09:33.281
You got ten minutes to give me everything
on your doping story.

09:33.364 --> 09:37.535
Ten minutes or the 20 milliliters of iron
I gave you will kill you.

09:38.119 --> 09:41.872
You give me your notebooks,
your laptop, your passwords.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.000
I give you adrenaline.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.668
I get what I want.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.212
And you get the antidote you need.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.717
-[indistinct chatter]
-[telephones ringing]

09:57.179 --> 09:58.014
Junior!

09:58.097 --> 10:00.224
Right, on his shoes coming untied.

10:00.308 --> 10:02.310
You! Go out!

10:02.393 --> 10:03.227
Oh, dear.

10:03.311 --> 10:06.063
I was hoping time would heal this wound.

10:06.147 --> 10:09.775
We set the odds right, people
will bet on his hair lighting on fire.

10:11.652 --> 10:13.112
Speaking of odds.

10:14.322 --> 10:17.408
What are the odds you take
one more step, I blow your head off?

10:20.536 --> 10:21.454
What's this?

10:21.537 --> 10:22.622
Bartman.

10:24.081 --> 10:25.207
That ball was destroyed.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.669
Uh-huh. And the moon is made of ribs.

10:29.253 --> 10:31.881
This doesn't make up
for Tannenbaum's disappearance.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.175
The man was an alcoholic!

10:34.258 --> 10:35.885
Plying him with mai tais

10:35.968 --> 10:38.179
and getting him to place his money

10:38.262 --> 10:41.932
on ships that would never come in
was not your finest moment.

10:42.016 --> 10:45.561
Yes, my relocation of him
cost you some ill-gotten gain.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.397
But now he's sober,
you have the Bartman ball.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.441
Peace on earth, good will toward men.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.152
-You got authentication?
-I do.

10:53.235 --> 10:55.529
I'll give it to you
after you've heard me out.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.741
Wakefield City starts in ten.

10:58.824 --> 10:59.825
You got five.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.202
It'll only take one.

11:01.285 --> 11:03.371
Is the Wakefield game on the level?

11:03.454 --> 11:04.664
As far as I know.

11:04.747 --> 11:05.665
-Why?
-[Raymond] Junior.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.333
This is Kenny Mills.

11:07.416 --> 11:08.501
We're associates.

11:08.584 --> 11:12.213
Or were, until we had a falling out
over a mutual friend.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.006
After her death, he spiraled,

11:14.090 --> 11:18.719
and like Tannenbaum, turned in sorrow
to your fine establishment.

11:18.803 --> 11:19.887
Check your records.

11:19.970 --> 11:24.975
He placed a $50,000 moneyline wager
on the Wakefield City match.

11:25.643 --> 11:29.230
As a down payment on what I hope
will be our renewed friendship,

11:29.313 --> 11:34.193
I promised Kenny I'd make sure you weren't
artificially sweetening the outcome.

11:34.276 --> 11:36.070
You or Dr. Maier.

11:36.153 --> 11:37.154
Maier?

11:37.238 --> 11:39.990
I haven't heard from him in,
oh, at least two years.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.576
Here I've heard you were working together.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.619
You heard wrong.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.996
Whatever he's doing, it's not for me.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.791
Forgive my ignorance, but who's Bartman?

11:48.874 --> 11:51.127
An innocent man wrongly accused.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.795
His life gets ruined.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.713
Then time heals.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.425
People apologize.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.051
Kind of like me and Red here.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.595
Sounds like maybe you guys too?

12:02.179 --> 12:03.889
Maybe. Maybe not.

12:08.018 --> 12:10.104
Make sure you give me everything.

12:12.273 --> 12:13.983
The truth will come out.

12:14.775 --> 12:15.818
Perhaps.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.736
But it won't be from you.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.117
[groans]

12:24.660 --> 12:26.328
[gasping]

12:28.664 --> 12:32.293
We're very sorry for your loss.
We appreciate you speaking with us.

12:32.376 --> 12:34.753
Thank you for saying that.
We're just, um--

12:37.715 --> 12:39.425
[sobbing] Sorry.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.302
It's too much.

12:42.261 --> 12:45.222
Losing him. Then you telling us
he might've been killed.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.349
-Who would do that?
-[door opens, then closes]

12:47.433 --> 12:49.143
I'm sorry I'm late.

12:49.226 --> 12:50.561
[Ken] No, please, come in.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.564
This is our dear friend Walker Burgos.

12:53.647 --> 12:56.233
My company sponsored Sam.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.152
Athlanta, the shoes, right?

12:58.235 --> 12:59.361
[Walker] And athletic wear.

12:59.445 --> 13:02.031
But when I met Sam, it was just shoes.

13:02.615 --> 13:06.076
He was our first endorsement.
Felt like a little brother of sorts.

13:07.828 --> 13:10.247
This man's name is Razmik Maier.

13:10.331 --> 13:13.375
We believe he provided
Sam with the drugs used to kill him.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.502
Do you know him?

13:15.044 --> 13:16.086
No.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.088
[sobbing]

13:19.256 --> 13:22.635
Let me get you some tissues.
Is your restroom this way?

13:22.718 --> 13:24.136
-It is. Thanks.
-Thank you.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.306
-Anything?
-[Walker] I know of him.

13:27.389 --> 13:31.477
Everyone in my business does.
Anyone with any sense knows to stay away.

13:37.608 --> 13:40.361
[ominous music playing]

13:49.453 --> 13:50.496
Thank you.

13:52.373 --> 13:56.752
You said you had reason
to believe all this?

13:56.835 --> 13:59.463
Who gave you that reason?
Was it that reporter?

13:59.547 --> 14:00.381
Reporter?

14:00.464 --> 14:03.717
She's always asking questions,
making accusations.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.679
Sam, he wouldn't jaywalk as a kid.

14:06.762 --> 14:08.305
He was a rule-follower.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.058
No way he'd be involved
with someone like that.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.768
Reporter, do you know her name?

14:12.851 --> 14:13.894
No idea.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.272
We refused to talk to her.

14:16.855 --> 14:17.940
Walker, help me out.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.483
Sam told me about her.

14:19.567 --> 14:23.529
Um, said she was a doctor of some sort.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.531
Worked for medical journals.

14:25.614 --> 14:27.575
Did pieces on health and fitness.

14:27.658 --> 14:30.244
He said her name was Stella.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.370
Stella Huang.

14:31.453 --> 14:34.498
Is she trying to convince you
our boy used drugs to cheat?

14:34.582 --> 14:36.083
[Park] We haven't spoken to Ms. Huang.

14:36.166 --> 14:39.295
But if she knows anything
that can help us,

14:39.378 --> 14:40.546
perhaps we should.

14:40.629 --> 14:43.007
Do you have her number
or know where she works?

14:43.090 --> 14:44.550
She could be in danger.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.719
I don't. It's possible my office does.

14:46.802 --> 14:47.928
Let me call.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.972
-Thanks, Walker.
-[Walker] Yeah. Of course.

14:50.055 --> 14:54.018
And if there's anything else
I can help with, feel free to call.

15:00.357 --> 15:01.942
Stella Huang, FBI.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.028
Ms. Huang.

15:07.239 --> 15:10.409
[dramatic music playing]

15:14.872 --> 15:16.582
I'm having trouble feeling a pulse.

15:16.665 --> 15:17.499
[Ressler] Clear.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.503
This is Special Agent Alina Park.
We need EMTs.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.297
2440 Junior Terrace.

15:34.016 --> 15:34.850
What is that?

15:35.726 --> 15:37.519
-What are you talking about?
-Show me.

15:37.603 --> 15:40.689
And if you say "what,"
I'll report you as a thief.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.566
All right, you win.

15:42.650 --> 15:43.692
Put it back.

15:45.027 --> 15:45.945
I prefer the beard.

15:46.028 --> 15:48.697
At least you were honest
about having something to hide.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.200
Hang on, Stella. Help's coming.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.999
Stella Huang died on her way to the ER.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.960
-What do we know about her?
-[Dembe] Not much.

16:01.043 --> 16:04.755
She was an MD who did health reporting.
Also had a sports medicine podcast.

16:04.838 --> 16:08.050
When I asked Sam's parents about Maier,
they assumed I had spoken to Huang.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.552
It was clear she'd figured out
there was a connection.

16:10.636 --> 16:13.180
Maier was so good,
doping agencies couldn't catch him.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.140
But Stella Huang did.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.142
It makes sense he killed her.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.436
-How do the Boswells fit into this?
-They don't.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.438
Raymond was right.
They did work with Maier.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.691
-That ended years ago.
-Maier acted alone?

16:23.774 --> 16:26.735
If she had evidence Maier
was doping Sam Rhode,

16:26.819 --> 16:28.237
whoever killed her took it.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.530
Stella was drugged.

16:29.613 --> 16:31.740
Not a PED, but it points to Maier.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.618
I agree. She knew about his involvement,
so he silenced her.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.203
But, uh, he didn't.

16:36.286 --> 16:38.580
-Silence her.
-Was something in the apartment?

16:38.664 --> 16:40.958
No. Or her clothes, or her car.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.085
But there was something in her.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.546
-In her?
-[Aram] Yeah. Like, inside her.

16:45.629 --> 16:49.967
The ME found this flash drive
in her intestinal tract.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.510
Can you extract any data?

16:51.593 --> 16:53.721
Maybe. Give or take a little gastric acid.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.055
Let us know.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.223
Dembe, Ressler.

16:56.306 --> 16:58.726
Go back to the family,
see if they can tell you more

16:58.809 --> 17:01.645
about the connection
between Sam and Dr. Maier.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.814
It was clear they didn't know much.

17:03.897 --> 17:06.692
But there was someone who might.
Walker Burgos.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.319
-The CEO of Athlanta?
-Yeah.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.780
-How do you know about him?
-Uh, his company.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.491
Last year, I signed up for a triathlon.
Didn't do it.

17:14.575 --> 17:18.871
The whole peeing-while-riding-your-bike
thing was too intimidating.

17:18.954 --> 17:22.207
But I got really into the idea
of running and bought sunglasses.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.417
Those sunglasses.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.420
The one Sam Rhode endorses
along with everything he's wearing.

17:26.503 --> 17:29.256
Burgos said he spoke to Sam
about the reporter.

17:29.339 --> 17:30.716
He offered to help us.

17:30.799 --> 17:33.135
That's a generous offer.
Take him up on it.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.471
Mind if I punt this to Aram and Dembe?

17:35.554 --> 17:37.765
Alina's having another one
of her headaches.

17:37.848 --> 17:42.269
-Wanna make sure she's okay.
-I'm sure she'll appreciate your concern.

17:44.980 --> 17:45.981
[door opens]

17:47.858 --> 17:50.778
-How's your headache?
-I don't have a headache.

17:50.861 --> 17:54.156
I told Cooper I did
so I didn't have to be around you.

17:54.948 --> 17:58.327
Look, I don't have an excuse.
But I do have an explanation.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.330
I'm sure you do.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.707
I'm sure you have a thousand explanations.

18:03.791 --> 18:06.627
But not one that explains
how you could be such a dick.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.463
You do know my marriage
is hanging by a thread.

18:09.546 --> 18:12.341
That I got zapped by a weapon
that can kill through walls.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.218
That I had a miscarriage.

18:14.301 --> 18:17.721
But still,
I found the time to invest in you.

18:17.805 --> 18:18.931
In your problem.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.349
In trying to fix it.

18:20.432 --> 18:23.435
Which is the last thing
I should have done.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.396
Helping you cheat the drug test
so you wouldn't lose your job

18:26.480 --> 18:28.065
like my mom lost hers.

18:29.525 --> 18:30.776
She fell apart.

18:30.859 --> 18:33.570
So I figured if I helped you...

18:34.154 --> 18:35.280
you wouldn't.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.699
Well, I'm done helping you.

18:38.325 --> 18:41.954
If you don't help yourself,
I'll tell Cooper about the drug test.

18:42.037 --> 18:44.456
You tell Cooper you helped me cheat,

18:44.540 --> 18:46.500
you're gonna be
in as much trouble as I am.

18:46.583 --> 18:49.711
That's right.
It's called taking responsibility.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.131
Something you're clearly incapable of.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.508
Shut the door on your way out.

18:59.304 --> 19:01.056
[Sloan] Fast forward to 13:34.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.016
Stop. Now play it from there.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.937
The second you look away,
see what he does, the bartender.

19:09.940 --> 19:10.774
Why?

19:12.568 --> 19:14.987
I see it, but I still can't believe it.

19:15.779 --> 19:16.947
Or understand it.

19:17.030 --> 19:20.367
Our plan was to ID who did it,
then find out why.

19:20.450 --> 19:21.618
Now we have a lead.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.537
His name is Abel Judge.

19:23.620 --> 19:26.331
Find him,
you're one step closer to finding out

19:26.415 --> 19:29.042
who's threatening your life
and your livelihood.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.966
Before we go further, I wanna thank you.

19:36.049 --> 19:39.094
What's happened is unimaginable
and the attention you're giving it

19:39.178 --> 19:40.888
means the world to me and my company.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.890
We were talking about Stella Huang.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.600
Sam talked to me about her.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.810
She was alleging he worked with Maier.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.396
-He denied it, but--
-You believe he was doping.

19:49.479 --> 19:52.149
I do. At his age, what he was doing...

19:52.232 --> 19:54.943
I should've said something.
But when he won, my company won,

19:55.027 --> 19:56.320
so I didn't.

19:57.362 --> 19:58.572
I have to live with that.

19:58.655 --> 20:02.367
Not having the courage to speak out
against the doping that's such a cancer.

20:02.451 --> 20:05.245
Apparently, Stella Huang
had the courage I lack.

20:05.329 --> 20:08.415
What she was doing,
trying to expose Razmik Maier,

20:08.498 --> 20:09.625
I admire her for that.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.752
Know anyone Maier might be working with?

20:11.835 --> 20:13.921
Any other athletes you sponsor?

20:14.004 --> 20:15.672
I don't. I'm sorry.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.966
You might not know,
but whoever's doing this does.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.927
They stole Stella's notes and computer.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.346
We'll need a list
of all the athletes you sponsor.

20:22.429 --> 20:25.682
Of course. I can call the office now
and have them send the list over.

20:25.766 --> 20:28.352
Thank you. We'll give you some privacy.

20:29.311 --> 20:32.439
-When you're finished, we'll be outside.
-Thank you.

20:36.860 --> 20:40.697
Hey, can I please get a list
of all the athletes we sponsor,

20:40.781 --> 20:41.865
names and numbers?

20:41.949 --> 20:43.867
Oh, also, um,

20:43.951 --> 20:46.787
Ani Bolin, does she still live in Philly?

20:47.371 --> 20:48.497
[speaking in Spanish]

20:48.580 --> 20:50.123
Oh, no, no, no.

20:50.207 --> 20:52.042
[Spanish music playing over speakers]

20:52.125 --> 20:53.210
What's going on?

20:53.293 --> 20:56.046
Cosecha Mayas, your favorite restaurant.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.590
[in Spanish] Surprise!

20:59.174 --> 21:00.300
Good to see you, Mierce.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.594
[in Spanish]
Herman? What are you doing here?

21:03.095 --> 21:05.681
Since we can't be in Flores,
I thought we'd bring it here.

21:05.764 --> 21:08.767
[Herman in English] Raymond called,
said you missed home and my tamales.

21:08.850 --> 21:12.271
Next thing I know,
a car shows up, takes me to the airport,

21:12.354 --> 21:13.522
and here I am.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.858
I'm missing some coriander.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.820
Weecha can take you to the market.
Get whatever else you need.

21:19.903 --> 21:23.282
I hope you're hungry.
I plan on making a feast.

21:33.458 --> 21:38.588
You were so down this morning.
I'm hoping this will raise your spirits.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.429
[in English] Tadashi left you this.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.432
He said he found what you asked for.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.851
The rest of the story.

21:50.934 --> 21:52.728
You want to raise my spirits?

21:52.811 --> 21:53.895
Don't look.

21:55.355 --> 21:56.857
Nothing good will come from it.

21:56.940 --> 21:58.483
Why does it bother you?

21:59.318 --> 22:02.029
It's important to me, but it upsets you.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.405
Why is that?

22:03.488 --> 22:06.700
I appreciate what you did,
bringing Herman.

22:07.784 --> 22:09.870
But I don't want us to be...

22:11.121 --> 22:12.664
eating his food here.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.417
I want us to be there.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.003
The way we were.

22:18.086 --> 22:20.172
You think that this prevents that.

22:20.797 --> 22:21.923
I think it will.

22:23.008 --> 22:24.176
If you open it.

22:24.801 --> 22:27.804
[ominous music playing]

22:33.518 --> 22:36.271
Burgos gave us a list of
the Athlanta athletes.

22:36.354 --> 22:39.983
No one knows or is willing
to say anything about Maier.

22:40.067 --> 22:43.111
Red was wrong about the Boswells.
Maybe he's wrong about Maier too.

22:43.195 --> 22:46.698
What, there's another explanation
for why Stella Huang was killed?

22:46.782 --> 22:49.701
We have a theory why she was killed,
not an explanation.

22:49.785 --> 22:53.288
Maier killed her because he was
afraid of being exposed, being found out.

22:53.371 --> 22:54.873
[Dembe] What about the tennis player?

22:54.956 --> 22:57.375
You think that's reason
for Maier to kill an athlete

22:57.459 --> 22:59.294
when he's devoted his life
to helping them?

22:59.377 --> 23:01.004
[Park] I do. In my experience,

23:01.088 --> 23:04.007
people will do anything
to hide what they're ashamed of.

23:04.716 --> 23:06.718
Experience is one thing.
Facts are another.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.470
At this point, we don't have any.

23:08.553 --> 23:11.807
Okay, okay, okay.
The way she swallowed the flash drive?

23:11.890 --> 23:15.227
First of all, wow, right?
Talk about dedication.

23:15.310 --> 23:18.355
Based on where it was found
in her intestinal tract,

23:18.438 --> 23:21.358
the ME says she swallowed it
five minutes before she died.

23:21.441 --> 23:24.277
While her killer was destroying evidence,
she was hiding some.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.738
You want evidence? Check this out.

23:27.364 --> 23:30.492
Most of the information
was destroyed by her stomach acid.

23:30.575 --> 23:35.122
Fun fact, did you know that acidity
is measured on a pH scale from zero to 14,

23:35.205 --> 23:38.917
with stomach acid clocking in at a one,
just above battery acid?

23:39.000 --> 23:42.337
-Were any of the files uncorrupted?
-Oh. Yeah. Right, right.

23:42.420 --> 23:43.713
And they showed this:

23:45.215 --> 23:47.759
-[Cooper] What do these tell us?
-[Park] That Maier was the killer.

23:47.843 --> 23:50.512
-And he's not done killing.
-Who's the unsub?

23:50.595 --> 23:52.973
Ani Bolin, a top middle-distance runner

23:53.056 --> 23:55.642
and one of Athlanta's biggest stars.

23:55.725 --> 23:59.521
During my flirtation with being
a triathlete, I studied her form.

23:59.604 --> 24:02.440
Got obsessed with it, actually.
The length of her stride,

24:02.524 --> 24:05.110
pounds-per-square-inch,
every time she pushed off.

24:05.193 --> 24:08.697
Basically, the way she flies
was so depressingly impossible

24:08.780 --> 24:12.159
for me to approximate that I decided
to stick with what I'm good at.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.160
Cycling, right?

24:13.743 --> 24:14.661
Orange sherbet.

24:14.744 --> 24:17.414
Dembe, Park,
get Bolin's address and roll out.

24:17.497 --> 24:21.418
Ressler, call Burgos. Have him contact
his athlete and get her to sit tight.

24:21.501 --> 24:24.254
There have been two victims.
There isn't gonna be a third.

24:25.088 --> 24:28.466
Mr. Burgos? Ressler.
I need you to reach out to Ani Bolin.

24:28.550 --> 24:31.928
-Maier, he's targeting her, isn't he?
-He might be. That's why I'm calling.

24:32.012 --> 24:34.806
Let her know there's nothing
to worry about. We're on our way.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.391
I will. Thanks for the heads up.

24:36.474 --> 24:37.642
[cell phone ringing]

24:39.603 --> 24:42.314
-Hello?
-Ani, it's me. I just spoke to the FBI.

24:42.397 --> 24:44.399
Thank God.
It's about time they get involved.

24:44.482 --> 24:47.527
I don't wanna get caught,
but I don't wanna end up like Sam either.

24:47.611 --> 24:49.362
-You won't end up like Sam.
-Or Stella.

24:49.446 --> 24:51.406
She was a pain in the ass,
but, oh, my God.

24:51.489 --> 24:55.410
Ani, listen to me. I told the FBI
I'd stay with you until they got here.

24:55.493 --> 24:57.537
Here? What, are you in Philly?

24:57.621 --> 25:00.415
I am. For a meeting
that involves you, actually.

25:00.498 --> 25:04.002
I'm not interested in meetings.
I wanna know why this is happening.

25:04.085 --> 25:06.296
Do you even know where Maier is?

25:06.379 --> 25:07.631
No.

25:08.798 --> 25:10.717
I haven't heard from him at all.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.387
Just sit tight. Help is on the way.

25:16.473 --> 25:19.184
[ominous music playing]

25:30.403 --> 25:31.529
You're packing.

25:31.613 --> 25:32.864
I want to go home.

25:34.324 --> 25:37.369
I love you, but I'm afraid of this place.

25:37.452 --> 25:39.496
What it does to you and to Weecha.

25:39.579 --> 25:41.998
I can't watch what it's turning you into.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.836
I want you, Mierce.

25:46.920 --> 25:47.796
Yes.

25:49.256 --> 25:50.715
And you want this.

25:56.179 --> 25:57.514
Can't they co-exist?

25:57.597 --> 25:59.516
In some people.

25:59.599 --> 26:00.642
Not in you.

26:00.725 --> 26:01.977
It consumes you.

26:02.477 --> 26:04.020
It will be over soon.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.897
It was over when we met.

26:14.072 --> 26:15.824
I thought it was.

26:18.576 --> 26:19.744
I was wrong.

26:22.580 --> 26:24.291
You're better than this.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.043
This should not define you.

26:27.127 --> 26:30.880
You know what Elizabeth was to me,
who she was to me.

26:30.964 --> 26:31.798
Yes.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.843
Which is why I know you have to let go.

26:35.635 --> 26:36.594
Not of her...

26:37.387 --> 26:38.471
but of your anger.

26:39.264 --> 26:42.267
Your need for revenge.
It's going to kill others.

26:43.685 --> 26:45.770
I don't want it to kill you.

26:48.773 --> 26:51.318
Please... let go.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.738
Don't do it for me. Do it for you.

26:57.782 --> 26:59.576
If I do that, will you stay?

27:00.994 --> 27:02.037
I would.

27:03.288 --> 27:04.956
But if I stay, you won't.

27:10.545 --> 27:12.047
I should finish packing.

27:19.471 --> 27:21.139
What the hell is going on?

27:21.222 --> 27:25.018
Stella Huang found out about Maier,
started asking questions.

27:25.101 --> 27:27.979
Maier got spooked,
started covering his tracks.

27:28.563 --> 27:32.942
-By killing Sam and Stella? That's insane.
-It is. But he won't find you.

27:33.026 --> 27:34.819
We're safe. I'll protect you.

27:34.903 --> 27:37.739
Until the world finds out
I was one of his clients.

27:37.822 --> 27:41.618
Everyone will know I was doping,
and there's no keeping me safe from that.

27:41.701 --> 27:43.453
You don't have to worry.

27:43.536 --> 27:45.622
You're the one who hooked me up with him.

27:45.705 --> 27:47.916
You said my contract
was contingent upon results,

27:47.999 --> 27:51.378
knowing that the only way I could get
those results was through Maier.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.338
-You didn't like those results?
-I'm not--

27:53.421 --> 27:57.342
The sub-four-minute 1500?
The prize money, the added attention?

27:57.425 --> 27:59.677
You became famous, I sold more shoes.

27:59.761 --> 28:02.389
The only difference is,
now he's coming after me, not you.

28:02.472 --> 28:04.849
I told you, you don't have to worry.

28:04.933 --> 28:09.020
You told me he's covering his tracks.
Sam, Stella, he got to them.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.731
How can you be sure
he won't come for me too?

28:11.815 --> 28:16.111
Because I am here,
and I won't let anything happen to you.

28:17.237 --> 28:18.071
Okay?

28:18.780 --> 28:20.448
Come here. Come here.

28:25.745 --> 28:29.582
Is that Maier's bag?
You said you hadn't heard from him.

28:29.666 --> 28:31.042
[grunting]

28:35.880 --> 28:38.049
I'm afraid I lied about that.

28:50.395 --> 28:52.480
-[Walker] Open up. It's me.
-[knocking on door]

28:52.564 --> 28:53.732
Open up.

28:55.483 --> 28:58.069
The FBI knows. Not everything, but enough.

28:58.862 --> 29:02.157
They're coming to talk to her.
I bought us time, 30 minutes, no more.

29:02.240 --> 29:05.577
I got everything, all her work.
Ani's the only one left who knows.

29:06.786 --> 29:07.620
Ani...

29:08.830 --> 29:09.998
and you.

29:10.081 --> 29:12.500
What-- What are you doing?

29:12.584 --> 29:15.128
The FBI asked me about you.
They know you're involved.

29:15.211 --> 29:17.046
People have been after me for years.

29:17.130 --> 29:19.799
The FBI will find out, and when they do,

29:19.883 --> 29:22.343
they could find me,
and that's not gonna happen.

29:24.679 --> 29:25.889
Let's go.

29:25.972 --> 29:27.557
-Burgos--
-Move!

[knocking on door]

29:45.200 --> 29:46.743

29:47.285 --> 29:48.161
Miss Bolin?

29:51.289 --> 29:53.416
Miss Bolin? FBI!

29:55.084 --> 29:56.252
Ani?

29:58.505 --> 29:59.881
Tell me we're not too late.

30:00.465 --> 30:03.760
Low pulse, loss of consciousness.

30:05.011 --> 30:08.056
Okay, it's chloroform.
We're late, but not too late.

30:10.558 --> 30:12.644
Call the paramedics.
I'm going after Maier.

30:13.269 --> 30:15.897
This is Special Agent Aram Mojtabai
with the FBI.

30:15.980 --> 30:19.442
We need a team at 32 Cottage Grove Ave--

30:20.276 --> 30:23.571
Whoa! It's me, Walker.
I came as fast as I could.

30:24.906 --> 30:28.618
-What happened?
-Maier. We came in, he went out.

30:28.701 --> 30:30.912
Don't let him get away! Go! I'll call 911.

30:30.995 --> 30:32.956
I called them.
The paramedics will be here.

30:33.039 --> 30:35.708
-Go. Please.
-Okay, thank you.

30:38.586 --> 30:40.922
[Ressler]
We've been going through Huang's files.

30:41.005 --> 30:44.008
They weren't just photos.
There were documents, receipts.

30:44.592 --> 30:47.387
She knew who Maier met with,
and who was paying for his work.

30:47.470 --> 30:49.389
That's Maier with Walker Burgos.

30:49.472 --> 30:54.018
These are e-mails and text threads,
proving that Maier was on Burgos' payroll,

30:54.102 --> 30:56.521
that his supplies
and the facility he worked from

30:56.604 --> 30:59.566
were paid out of an Athlanta
slush fund controlled by Burgos.

30:59.649 --> 31:01.067
The reporter knew everything.

31:01.150 --> 31:04.028
That Burgos paid Maier
to juice their athletes.

31:04.112 --> 31:06.406
Publishing that would destroy Burgos.

31:06.489 --> 31:10.243
Alert Park and Aram there's another
suspect to be on the lookout for.

31:12.036 --> 31:13.997
Burgos is with her now. Anything?

31:14.080 --> 31:16.291
No, which is weird.
The way the apartment looked,

31:16.374 --> 31:18.877
I could've sworn
he couldn't have gotten far.

31:20.169 --> 31:21.379
It's Ressler.

31:21.462 --> 31:23.673
Ani should be fine, but Maier's gone.

31:23.756 --> 31:26.426
It's not just Maier. It's Burgos.
They're working together.

31:26.509 --> 31:28.303
-Say that again.
-Burgos played us.

31:34.267 --> 31:35.977
No, no, no. Oh, come on.

Great. Just in time.

32:27.987 --> 32:29.948
Herman, it looks delicious.

32:32.909 --> 32:33.952
Have you looked?

32:34.911 --> 32:36.704
We can talk about that later.

32:37.664 --> 32:38.623
You looked.

32:40.500 --> 32:44.671
I told Weecha to get a new bouquet
each week and put them in water.

32:45.838 --> 32:48.591
After five days, send me a picture.

32:49.676 --> 32:52.762
Depending on what they look like,
I'll know what to do for you.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.692
How are you gonna leave?
Do you want me to drive you?

33:05.775 --> 33:07.694
-[Mierce] I called a car.
-I'll drive you.

33:07.777 --> 33:09.862
I prefer not.

33:14.242 --> 33:15.952
I need you, Mierce.

I know, Raymond.

[poignant music playing]

33:54.198 --> 33:55.700
[Aram] When I was a child,

33:56.701 --> 34:00.371
my parents took me to Greece
to see the wonders of the world.

34:00.455 --> 34:03.875
I slept through... Parthenon.

34:03.958 --> 34:06.836
I was bored to tears at Thermopylae.

34:06.919 --> 34:09.881
But when I got to Olympia

34:09.964 --> 34:12.425
and saw the remains
of the first Olympic stadium,

34:12.508 --> 34:14.427
I was overwhelmed.

34:14.510 --> 34:16.888
If you're ramping up
to ask me a question, don't.

34:16.971 --> 34:18.556
I'm not saying anything without a lawyer.

34:18.639 --> 34:22.101
As a general rule, yes, questions
are part of interrogating a suspect.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.812
But in your case,
our questions have been answered.

34:24.896 --> 34:28.357
Then as I'm not interested
in your summer vacations,

34:28.441 --> 34:30.943
-there's nothing to discuss.
-Sports predates math.

34:31.027 --> 34:33.529
History began with writing,

34:33.613 --> 34:38.910
and sports began 7000 years
before people learned to write.

34:39.577 --> 34:41.496
Sports isn't just as old as man.

34:41.579 --> 34:44.207
It is essential to mankind.

34:44.290 --> 34:46.501
And you perverted it, you and Maier,

34:46.584 --> 34:51.839
and everyone who takes something
so pure and elegant and fair...

34:52.381 --> 34:53.841
and cheats.

34:56.469 --> 34:57.303
Thanks, Lewis.

35:00.306 --> 35:01.974
Yeah, we found your car.

35:02.642 --> 35:07.814
<i>And Maier, and all the evidence</i>
<i>you took from Stella Huang.</i>

35:07.897 --> 35:13.653
There is evidence here that shows
you were juicing 32 athletes.

35:15.279 --> 35:19.492
See, you thought Stella Huang
only knew about Sam and Ani,

35:20.159 --> 35:21.577
but she knew everything.

35:21.661 --> 35:25.248
And now so do we.
Why don't you start from the beginning?

35:34.257 --> 35:37.927
Going to the cemetery
made things harder, not easier.

35:38.010 --> 35:40.888
If there was a light
at the end of the tunnel,

35:40.972 --> 35:43.474
visiting Liz only made it harder to see.

35:46.144 --> 35:50.690
When I put back the prescription pad,
I'd already torn off a page.

35:50.773 --> 35:52.150
I used it to get these.

36:00.533 --> 36:04.412
You can't do this alone,
weaning yourself off, titrating.

36:04.495 --> 36:06.831
It's like handcuffing yourself
to your desk at night

36:06.914 --> 36:08.749
just to keep from falling off the wagon.

36:09.584 --> 36:10.877
You need help.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.880
Help I can't give you
because I don't know how,

36:13.963 --> 36:16.424
so when I try, I only make things worse.

36:18.843 --> 36:20.428
I know you're going through a lot,

36:20.511 --> 36:23.931
and I don't wanna add to your burdens,
but I'm asking you, please...

he wanted you to work with him?

36:51.250 --> 36:53.711
Was it about the good old days?

It was definitely about the old days.

36:56.130 --> 36:58.299
Good, not so much.

[Raymond] <i>That's where you told Elizabeth.</i>

37:20.780 --> 37:21.948
In a coffee shop.

37:22.490 --> 37:25.618
Based on when I asked you
to give her the letter after I'm dead

37:25.701 --> 37:27.370
and the time stamp on the photos,

37:27.453 --> 37:29.538
it took you just over an hour
to betray me.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.540
We already discussed this.

37:32.166 --> 37:33.376
That I told her.

37:33.459 --> 37:35.836
The photos came from Vandyke's phone.

37:36.462 --> 37:39.048
I asked Tadashi to pull GPS coordinates

37:39.131 --> 37:43.552
to see where Vandyke had gone
in the hours before he shot Elizabeth.

37:43.636 --> 37:46.847
Tadashi found the coordinates,
but then he found these.

37:47.348 --> 37:51.769
And, yes, the images only confirm
what you and I have already discussed.

37:51.852 --> 37:55.106
What we haven't discussed,
what the photos really show,

37:55.189 --> 37:57.984
is that the man who killed Elizabeth,
a man you knew,

37:58.067 --> 38:01.153
was 20 feet from you, taking your picture.

38:01.237 --> 38:06.826
And you were so intent on your betrayal...
that you missed him.

38:07.743 --> 38:09.412
And in missing him,

38:09.495 --> 38:12.957
you failed to protect both me and her.

38:16.043 --> 38:18.337
How did Vandyke know
where we'd be that night?

38:19.463 --> 38:23.092
How is it that he was
waiting for us at the restaurant?

38:23.175 --> 38:26.595
No one knew we'd all be there,

38:27.138 --> 38:31.642
except for Elizabeth, and you and me.

38:31.726 --> 38:32.935
Yet there he was.

38:33.936 --> 38:35.313
And now we know why.

38:36.272 --> 38:42.361
Your job wasn't to tell my story
the way you wanted it told.

38:42.862 --> 38:45.948
Whether or not you were
at peace with my decision

38:46.032 --> 38:48.784
was irrelevant to what I hired you to do.

38:48.868 --> 38:50.202
You had a job.

38:51.746 --> 38:55.958
And for decades, you did it better
than anyone possibly could.

38:56.042 --> 38:57.460
Until you didn't.

38:58.878 --> 39:01.839
You could sense a threat a mile away.

39:02.548 --> 39:04.008
But the biggest threat?

39:04.091 --> 39:06.469
Standing 20 feet away?

39:07.219 --> 39:08.346
You missed him.

39:09.597 --> 39:12.099
And Elizabeth is dead because of that.
