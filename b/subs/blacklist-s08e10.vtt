-No. But you had her in custody,

12:53.981 --> 12:55.983
[suspenseful music playing]

12:58.861 --> 13:00.779
[Ressler] Headlight trim from the van.

13:00.863 --> 13:01.780
It's a start.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.162
[dramatic music playing]

13:09.455 --> 13:10.456
[Perillos] Mm.

13:11.415 --> 13:12.541
Look at you.

13:13.626 --> 13:17.254
So you're the one they call... Dembe.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.848
Quite a collection, isn't it?

13:29.016 --> 13:31.810
Each one teaches me something about pain.

13:32.436 --> 13:33.854
How to alleviate it...

13:37.983 --> 13:39.610
or inflict it.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.452
When I was 12,

13:48.536 --> 13:51.288
my mother went to the hospital
with a neural infection

13:51.372 --> 13:54.750
that was misdiagnosed
as a strained muscle.

13:55.292 --> 14:00.047
She was given ibuprofen
and sent home with an infection

14:00.631 --> 14:03.133
that left her in excruciating pain

14:03.884 --> 14:06.220
and bedridden for the rest of her life.

14:07.012 --> 14:09.223
What caused the misdiagnosis?

14:10.224 --> 14:12.643
-[Dembe grunts]
-The color of her skin.

14:13.561 --> 14:16.939
The belief, even by some doctors,

14:17.439 --> 14:19.942
that Blacks feel less pain than whites.

14:20.651 --> 14:22.945
Thick skin, biology, breeding...

14:23.696 --> 14:27.950
lies that lead to Black patients receiving
far fewer pain meds than white patients.

14:28.742 --> 14:30.995
But we know the truth, don't we, Dembe?

14:32.079 --> 14:34.999
We know all about pain, don't we?

14:37.668 --> 14:39.670
It's called a heretic's fork.

14:40.170 --> 14:43.632
It was used during the Spanish Inquisition
to extract confessions,

14:43.716 --> 14:45.801
break the human spirit.

14:47.177 --> 14:48.262
Tell the truth,

14:48.888 --> 14:51.974
or sooner or later, you'll bleed to death.

14:53.058 --> 14:57.229
It's inscribed
with the Latin word <i>"abiuro,"</i>

14:57.313 --> 15:00.107
which means to swear or take an oath.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.360
Will you do that for me, Dembe?

15:03.861 --> 15:07.239
Swear to tell me everything you know
about the Sikorsky Archive?

15:07.323 --> 15:08.616
I won't lie.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.870
I swear I won't tell you anything.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.878
Oh, I think you will.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.011
[cell phone ringing]

15:30.763 --> 15:32.097
Tell me you found something.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.892
[Ressler] We think we found the van
used in the abduction.

15:34.975 --> 15:37.811
It's missing a piece of the headlight trim
we found at the scene.

15:37.895 --> 15:38.729
<i>What about Dembe?</i>

15:38.812 --> 15:41.565
Does the van tell you anything
about where they took him?

15:41.649 --> 15:43.734
We're waiting on the lab,
but it's unlikely.

15:43.817 --> 15:46.570
The vehicle was torched,
MPD is doing a search now.

15:46.654 --> 15:49.657
Lab services should have a report
within 24 hours, maybe less.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.075
We don't have that time.

15:51.158 --> 15:52.910
I'm telling you what we know.

15:53.535 --> 15:55.079
Yeah. Thank you, Donald.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.806
[women shrieking]

16:17.685 --> 16:19.311
Look-- Look, please--

16:21.939 --> 16:22.940
No.

16:23.607 --> 16:25.234
You betrayed us.

16:25.317 --> 16:28.070
-You heard Dembe talking about Ruddiger.
-No.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.489
-You knew where we were gonna be.
-No.

16:30.572 --> 16:31.740
You set us up.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.243
[phone ringing]

16:37.621 --> 16:39.456
I think you better answer that.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.213
[man] <i>Operator 627, Ward West.</i>

16:46.296 --> 16:49.049
Ward West. Briargate confirm.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.677
<i>We have a code-red alarm indicator.</i>
<i>Do you have a breach?</i>

16:51.760 --> 16:54.513
Yes, there's been a breach. By me.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.265
Here's what happens next.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.392
I'm gonna give you a phone number,

16:58.475 --> 17:01.186
you're gonna pass it up the food chain
to your boss.

17:01.270 --> 17:04.106
Tell Neville Townsend
it's Raymond Reddington.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.400
Tell him to call me in 20 minutes

17:06.483 --> 17:11.155
at 202-555-0184.

17:11.238 --> 17:13.949
It's a conversation he won't wanna miss.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.076
[Bobby grunts and women yelling]

17:17.911 --> 17:19.997
I'll get you a cane to remember me by.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.918
My apologies, ladies.

17:34.636 --> 17:36.430
[Townsend] <i>Hello, Mr. Zuma.</i>

17:36.513 --> 17:38.348
<i>I'm sorry we had to meet like this,</i>

17:38.432 --> 17:42.978
<i>but I've found this process to be both</i>
<i>efficient and effective for all involved.</i>

17:43.062 --> 17:46.648
I'm going to ask you some questions,
you're going to answer.

17:46.732 --> 17:51.487
<i>If you waver, Dr. Perillos will help</i>
<i>encourage your cooperation.</i>

17:51.570 --> 17:54.740
<i>Let's begin with the Sikorsky Archive.</i>

17:54.823 --> 17:56.283
<i>Does Reddington have it?</i>

17:59.870 --> 18:02.539
<i>Now, Mr. Zuma, I need an answer.</i>

18:03.707 --> 18:05.417
<i>No? Nothing?</i>

18:09.463 --> 18:12.966
The Irukandji jellyfish is found
off the coast of Australia.

18:13.592 --> 18:16.095
Its sting is only mildly irritating.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.138
But within half an hour,

18:18.222 --> 18:23.102
its venom induces excruciating
muscle cramps, severe back pain,

18:23.185 --> 18:26.021
and a burning sensation
in the skin and face,

18:26.522 --> 18:30.275
headaches, sweating, nausea.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.903
It's called Irukandji syndrome.

18:32.986 --> 18:37.658
The pain, combined with an increase
in heart rate and blood pressure,

18:38.117 --> 18:40.536
causes a feeling of impending doom.

18:41.703 --> 18:42.788
Chances are...

18:43.622 --> 18:47.334
you just may want to impale yourself
to ease the pain.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.838
<i>Mr. Zuma, shall we discuss</i>
<i>the Sikorsky Archive,</i>

18:50.921 --> 18:52.923
<i>or do you need some encouragement?</i>

18:56.093 --> 18:58.470
<i>Bad choice, Mr. Zuma.</i>

18:58.554 --> 19:00.264
Don't say I didn't warn you.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.809
<i>Doctor, I'll give the two of you</i>
<i>some time together.</i>

19:05.060 --> 19:07.354
-What is it?
-Reddington. He's made contact.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.239
[cell phone ringing]

19:19.116 --> 19:21.702
Dembe Zuma. I want him back.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.036
I'm sure you do.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.497
Keen tells me he knows all your secrets.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.332
<i>Elizabeth would never hurt Dembe.</i>

19:27.416 --> 19:28.750
I want the archive.

19:28.834 --> 19:31.587
At what cost? A war with me?

19:31.670 --> 19:33.463
Have you thought about what that means?

19:33.547 --> 19:37.551
All I've thought about recently
is the fact that you killed my family.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.387
I don't know
what Elizabeth is telling you,

19:40.470 --> 19:43.265
but Katarina Rostova killed your family,

19:43.348 --> 19:44.892
and I killed her.

19:44.975 --> 19:49.062
<i>That alone should be enough</i>
<i>for us to peacefully co-exist.</i>

19:49.146 --> 19:52.816
A fact we can discuss in person
once you accept my offer.

19:53.317 --> 19:54.776
What kind of offer?

19:54.860 --> 19:56.111
For Dembe.

19:56.612 --> 19:57.613
Me for him.

19:57.696 --> 20:00.199
-A trade?
<i>-Yes.</i>

20:00.282 --> 20:02.618
-And then an uprising.
-[Townsend chuckles]

20:02.701 --> 20:05.704
Your people,
rallying around your sacrifice?

20:05.787 --> 20:08.207
I had no idea you were such a romantic.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.042
Oh, my goodness, yes.

20:10.584 --> 20:14.630
I have many "thoughts that do often
lie too deep for tears."

20:15.589 --> 20:19.718
At the moment, the main one
being to put a bullet in your forehead.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.221
<i>Do we have a deal?</i>

20:22.304 --> 20:24.765
We do. I'll call you back
with the where and when.

20:31.521 --> 20:32.689
[groaning]

20:32.773 --> 20:34.191
[suspenseful music playing]

20:38.320 --> 20:41.240
[Perillos] I wasn't making it up.
About the doctors.

20:41.740 --> 20:46.036
In 2016, 222 white doctors

20:46.119 --> 20:50.582
at the University of Virginia
were given mock medical files

20:50.666 --> 20:53.293
of a white patient and a Black patient,

20:54.002 --> 20:57.547
and asked to gauge their pain
on a scale of one to ten.

20:58.215 --> 21:01.218
They underestimated
the Black patient's pain because--

21:02.052 --> 21:03.595
Now, these are doctors.

21:04.471 --> 21:09.184
--they said they thought Black people
had less sensitive nerve endings.

21:10.185 --> 21:13.689
Why is it that white people
don't see our pain?

21:14.231 --> 21:16.441
I know Townsend doesn't see mine.

21:17.567 --> 21:18.902
What about Reddington?

21:20.028 --> 21:21.238
Does he see yours?

21:22.239 --> 21:23.782
I know who you are to him.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.118
What you do for him.

21:27.911 --> 21:28.954
The secrets you keep.

21:29.037 --> 21:31.915
Like you're doing now,
not telling me about the archive.

21:32.541 --> 21:35.294
Does he know what pain that causes you?

21:35.836 --> 21:38.380
I don't mean this pain,
anyone can see that.

21:39.339 --> 21:40.757
I mean, inside.

21:41.591 --> 21:43.385
The pain in your heart.

21:44.594 --> 21:45.762
Can he see that?

21:49.558 --> 21:51.393
<i>-You can stop.</i>
-Excuse me?

21:51.476 --> 21:53.979
<i>-We're making a trade.</i>
-For whom?

21:54.062 --> 21:56.315
Who could know the archive more than Zuma?

21:56.398 --> 21:57.399
Raymond.

22:02.988 --> 22:05.324
He's not doing this to save you.

22:05.824 --> 22:07.659
He's doing it to save himself.

22:08.952 --> 22:09.786
He...

22:14.708 --> 22:16.418
He does feel my pain.

22:17.794 --> 22:18.795
Does he, now?

22:19.713 --> 22:20.589
Good.

22:21.465 --> 22:24.009
-Then maybe he'll feel this.
-[yelling]

22:33.060 --> 22:33.894
[bell dings]

22:37.898 --> 22:40.025
-Help you?
-I'm here for a room.

22:40.108 --> 22:41.818
Neville said he'd leave a key.

22:42.319 --> 22:43.361
Oh, Neville said?

22:43.987 --> 22:44.905
Neville said.

22:46.323 --> 22:48.116
Come around. I'll buzz you in.

22:49.326 --> 22:50.869
[door buzzes]

22:50.952 --> 22:52.454
[Raymond] What about the dog?

22:52.537 --> 22:53.872
[man] There's no dog.

23:03.673 --> 23:04.591
Is this kosher?

23:09.179 --> 23:10.055
L'chaim.

23:16.144 --> 23:17.479
Okay.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.147
There's a bench outside.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.065
Have a seat.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.151
Concierge will be with you shortly.

23:23.819 --> 23:24.820
[cell phone dialing]

23:44.131 --> 23:45.966
I'm supposed to let you go.

23:47.217 --> 23:49.469
But your resistance is an inspiration.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.222
It makes me wonder...

23:52.931 --> 23:55.392
<i>are you really that beholden to him?</i>

23:56.059 --> 23:58.311
Would you hold out until it's too late?

23:59.104 --> 24:00.397
I guess we'll never know.

24:17.414 --> 24:21.042
Get back in there. I won't ask again.
[yells]

24:25.922 --> 24:27.090

24:31.595 --> 24:32.429
Antidote.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.028
[cell phone ringing]

24:50.405 --> 24:53.241
-Dembe.
-Don't do it, Raymond. I'm coming.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.784
Don't give yourself up.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.093
[dramatic music playing]

25:28.568 --> 25:30.028
[cell phone ringing]

25:33.323 --> 25:34.908
[Dembe] <i>Tell me you got there in time.</i>

25:35.533 --> 25:37.869
-Tell me you found him.
<i>-No. We were too late.</i>

25:37.953 --> 25:39.996
-What did you find?
<i>-We're securing the scene.</i>

25:40.080 --> 25:42.916
It looks like her people
broke everything down and cleared out.

25:42.999 --> 25:44.584
There's no sign of Reddington.

25:44.668 --> 25:48.588
Is there anything that you can tell me,
any specifics, details that might help?

25:48.672 --> 25:50.966
She had tools for torture.

25:51.049 --> 25:54.970
Then she injected me
with a vial of poison, from jellyfish.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.096
<i>Jellyfish?</i>

25:56.179 --> 25:59.099
Irukandji jellyfish.
That's what she called them.

25:59.599 --> 26:02.811
I reached out to some associates of ours
to find out who traffics them.

26:02.894 --> 26:05.855
All right. We'll--
Look, my forensics team's here.

26:05.939 --> 26:08.525
<i>Call me as soon as you hear anything</i>
<i>and I'll do the same.</i>

26:31.006 --> 26:32.132
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

26:33.008 --> 26:34.509
<i>You kept your end of the deal.</i>

26:34.592 --> 26:37.887
<i>And in a roundabout way, so did I.</i>

26:37.971 --> 26:39.389
Dembe escaped.

26:39.889 --> 26:42.559
<i>Yes. As promised, he's free.</i>

26:42.642 --> 26:45.228
And with him
went your leverage to get me to talk.

26:45.312 --> 26:48.315
<i>Oh, I don't know about that.</i>

26:50.191 --> 26:51.693
The Brazen Bull, I presume.

26:53.445 --> 26:56.364
Excellent.
You're familiar with Dr. Perillos.

26:56.448 --> 26:57.615
<i>Certainly.</i>

26:57.699 --> 27:00.785
<i>Legendarily draconian methods.</i>

27:01.411 --> 27:03.246
Undeniably effective results.

27:03.330 --> 27:06.166
This is almost
a bucket-list moment for me.

27:07.542 --> 27:09.586
-Shall we begin?
-Oh, let's not.

27:10.545 --> 27:12.922
Are you familiar
with lymphocytic choriomeningitis?

27:13.006 --> 27:15.633
If I say yes,
can we skip the demonstration?

27:16.968 --> 27:21.097
It's a viral infection carried by mice
that causes ascending paralysis.

27:21.181 --> 27:23.433
<i>The virus attacks</i>
<i>the peripheral nervous system,</i>

27:23.516 --> 27:25.602
<i>then works its way upwards</i>
<i>through the legs</i>

27:25.685 --> 27:27.062
<i>and torso to the chest.</i>

27:27.145 --> 27:29.314
Where it paralyzes the lungs...

27:30.940 --> 27:32.901
causing the victim to suffocate.

27:32.984 --> 27:34.861
Careful. I'm terribly ticklish.

27:36.071 --> 27:37.530
[chuckles] See?

27:38.281 --> 27:42.952
<i>There is an antidote. Which I will supply</i>
<i>after you've told me about the archive.</i>

27:43.036 --> 27:46.623
<i>Uh... Think about it. But not too long.</i>

27:47.582 --> 27:49.626
<i>You haven't got much time left.</i>

27:53.713 --> 27:56.758
What did you find out?
I haven't heard back from our people yet.

27:56.841 --> 28:01.262
It turns out Irukandji jellyfish
are sourced only by a few select brokers.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.723
-Brokers.
-Who sell animals to research labs,

28:03.807 --> 28:05.892
universities, veterinary schools,
and companies

28:05.975 --> 28:07.685
to provide animal-testing services.

28:07.769 --> 28:09.771
Disgusting, I know. And it gets worse.

28:09.854 --> 28:11.773
There are two types of these dealers.

28:11.856 --> 28:14.567
Class A, which breed specifically
for research purposes,

28:14.651 --> 28:18.363
and Class B, who source animals
from random locations like auctions,

28:18.446 --> 28:20.615
pounds or even newspaper ads.

28:20.698 --> 28:22.492
-That is disgusting.
-[Aram] Right?

28:22.575 --> 28:24.369
Like there's a separate
Blacklist case here.

28:24.452 --> 28:25.453
[Cooper] The point being?

28:25.537 --> 28:28.164
The point being,
I could only find three Class B vendors

28:28.248 --> 28:30.458
who supply our species of jellyfish.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.961
Two haven't made a sale
in over six months.

28:33.044 --> 28:34.045
[Dembe] And the third?

28:34.129 --> 28:36.339
The third is Tolofson-Hammond.

28:36.423 --> 28:38.550
London-based. License revoked.

28:38.633 --> 28:42.762
They have a court case pending,
and one client who failed to appear...

28:44.681 --> 28:46.766
-That's her.
-[Park] Kayla Lynne Banks.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.351
Last known address in Cardiff.

28:48.435 --> 28:49.894
Both of which are fakes.

28:49.978 --> 28:52.939
Okay, let's work backwards.
Unwind her alias.

28:53.022 --> 28:55.692
Find out where she got her passports,
her bank accounts.

28:56.317 --> 28:59.821
How she built this false identity.
It may point us to where she is now.

29:06.453 --> 29:07.287
Nothing?

29:08.747 --> 29:09.914
No pain at all?

29:11.124 --> 29:12.125
Good.

29:12.208 --> 29:14.627
And here I thought you fetishized pain.

29:14.711 --> 29:17.505
No more than an oncologist
fetishizes cancer.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.967
I study it in the hopes
of finding a cure for it.

29:21.050 --> 29:22.385
I don't believe you.

29:23.428 --> 29:27.390
I think you enjoy the means too much
to really care about the end.

29:29.058 --> 29:30.685
I'm not talking about a medicine.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.103
I'm talking about a solution.

29:32.812 --> 29:34.814
An alteration in our DNA.

29:35.523 --> 29:37.817
Did you know the mole rat
can't feel burning pain

29:37.901 --> 29:40.528
because it lacks the chemical substance P?

29:41.070 --> 29:43.573
You want people to be like mole rats?

29:43.656 --> 29:45.825
I want us to be impervious to pain.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.244
What a terrible idea.

29:51.915 --> 29:55.043
Spoken like someone
who's never had his pain ignored.

29:55.126 --> 29:58.129
Who's never begged for relief
and not gotten it.

29:58.213 --> 30:01.966
I'd prefer to have my pain ignored
than have no pain at all.

30:02.592 --> 30:05.428
Without pain,
there can be no real pleasure.

30:06.554 --> 30:10.099
Without the lows,
you have no way to measure the highs.

30:11.017 --> 30:15.939
If any part of your
sadism-in-the-name-of-science

30:16.022 --> 30:19.943
is designed
to improve the human condition...

30:21.069 --> 30:25.031
making us unfeeling is absolutely
the wrong way of going about it.

30:26.282 --> 30:27.283
[grunts]

30:27.784 --> 30:28.910
Case in point.

30:30.078 --> 30:33.748
This is gonna make killing you
infinitely more pleasurable.

30:36.793 --> 30:37.627
We're ready.

30:37.710 --> 30:39.337
<i>How much time does he have?</i>

30:39.838 --> 30:41.673
An hour, maybe less.

30:42.382 --> 30:44.717
<i>So the archive...</i>

30:45.260 --> 30:51.057
<i>Like the minister says at every wedding,</i>
<i>speak now or forever hold your peace.</i>

31:00.275 --> 31:01.192
[knocking on door]

31:01.276 --> 31:03.111
Is there anything on the APB?

31:03.194 --> 31:04.904
Not yet. And on your end?

31:04.988 --> 31:07.240
I called everyone,
everything's taking too long.

31:07.323 --> 31:09.826
There must be something
they missed at the scene.

31:09.909 --> 31:11.911
We've reviewed
all the crime-scene analysis,

31:11.995 --> 31:14.038
plus what we found
or didn't find at the van.

31:14.122 --> 31:15.957
We should go through it again.

31:21.838 --> 31:26.092
You take the forensics from the van,
I'll review the findings from the lab.

31:29.304 --> 31:32.682
Don't take this the wrong way,
but... you'd make a good cop.

31:32.765 --> 31:35.101
-You know what I do for a living.
-I do.

31:35.810 --> 31:37.562
I also know who you are.

31:38.271 --> 31:39.689
A Black Muslim.

31:40.690 --> 31:42.942
That describes quite a few cops.

31:43.818 --> 31:45.695
-We will find Raymond.
-Hope you're right.

31:45.778 --> 31:47.739
But he lives on the edge.

31:47.822 --> 31:49.657
And one day, he may go over it.

31:50.783 --> 31:52.535
[suspenseful music playing]

31:52.619 --> 31:55.413
The report says the van
was burned using an accelerant.

31:55.496 --> 31:56.497
That's right, uh...

31:57.457 --> 31:58.875
Cyclohexane.

31:58.958 --> 32:02.837
Which burns at a low flash point.
That's why there were no forensics.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.505
What does that tell you?

32:04.589 --> 32:07.800
That the absence of evidence is evidence.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.934
[Raymond wheezing]

32:24.275 --> 32:26.694
<i>It's not everything</i>
<i>you thought it would be, is it?</i>

32:27.862 --> 32:29.280
<i>This moment?</i>

32:31.282 --> 32:33.117
<i>You've waited for it...</i>

32:34.535 --> 32:36.204
anticipated it.

32:39.707 --> 32:40.917
But somehow, it's...

32:43.294 --> 32:45.088
dissatisfying.

32:45.171 --> 32:47.966
It actually exceeds expectation.

32:49.092 --> 32:50.885
<i>I wasn't talking to you.</i>

32:51.594 --> 32:54.555
We know who my assassin really is...

32:56.224 --> 32:57.725
don't we, Elizabeth?

32:59.143 --> 33:01.604
It saddens me to bear witness...

33:02.271 --> 33:05.066
to this moment in your life.

33:05.858 --> 33:06.693
This...

33:08.152 --> 33:10.947
crossing of a Rubicon...

33:12.073 --> 33:15.284
from which you can never get back.

33:17.745 --> 33:20.707
I know, in this moment, it may appear...

33:21.499 --> 33:24.043
self-serving to suggest...

33:25.003 --> 33:26.212
that you instruct...

33:27.588 --> 33:31.718
<i>the good doctor</i>
<i>to administer the antidote.</i>

33:33.344 --> 33:36.556
But I strongly suggest
that you do just that.

33:39.392 --> 33:42.270
Because I've...

33:43.187 --> 33:45.857
seen the other side of that river...

33:48.401 --> 33:50.445
and it's a place...

33:51.654 --> 33:52.697
I never...

33:54.157 --> 33:56.034
never wanted you to go.

34:00.496 --> 34:01.706
[knocking on door]

34:02.457 --> 34:03.624
Who is it?

34:07.795 --> 34:09.464
[knocking on door]

34:15.428 --> 34:16.429
I said--

34:17.472 --> 34:18.806
Dembe, wait. Hold up.

34:18.890 --> 34:20.141
Cyclohexane.

34:20.641 --> 34:22.393
Your accelerant.

34:22.477 --> 34:25.354
You used it to help them torch the van.

34:25.438 --> 34:26.355
Wait. Stop.

34:26.439 --> 34:27.440
You set us up!

34:27.523 --> 34:29.275
They tortured me!

34:30.318 --> 34:31.402
My hand!

34:31.486 --> 34:33.237
-They made me to do it.
-Where is he?

34:33.321 --> 34:35.990
They weren't supposed to take you.
They want Reddington.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.033
They have him.

34:38.242 --> 34:40.328
Ruddiger. Look at me!

34:41.746 --> 34:43.873
I'm gonna make
what that woman did to your hand

34:43.956 --> 34:48.377
feel like a manicure unless you tell me
where they're holding Raymond.

34:48.961 --> 34:51.172
-Ruddiger.
-The warehouse!

34:51.255 --> 34:54.425
East of the airport. Braxton and 9th.

34:58.513 --> 35:01.015
The radiator, tie yourself to it.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.725
-Dembe, please.
-Now!

35:07.396 --> 35:08.397
[grunting]

35:13.194 --> 35:14.445
He's not coming back.

35:18.866 --> 35:20.618
He's not coming back!

35:21.661 --> 35:23.037
[gasping]

35:23.121 --> 35:26.290
What you're experiencing
is unilateral paralysis.

35:26.874 --> 35:29.168
Your diaphragm is partially functioning,

35:29.252 --> 35:32.380
as the paralysis moves higher
into the chest cavity.

35:33.464 --> 35:36.425
Soon, your diaphragm
will be completely paralyzed

35:36.509 --> 35:38.970
and you will need a machine
to assist in breathing.

35:39.846 --> 35:42.014
Unfortunately for you, we have no machine.

35:42.890 --> 35:44.016
But I do have this.

35:44.851 --> 35:47.895
<i>The doctor's antidote</i>
<i>takes immediate effect.</i>

35:47.979 --> 35:50.648
You'll be breathing normally
within seconds.

35:50.731 --> 35:56.279
All you need to do first is tell me
what you know about the archive.

35:59.574 --> 36:02.869
-[Cooper] <i>Sorry, say that again?</i>
-8353 Braxton.

36:02.952 --> 36:06.164
I'm writing it down. But before
I send units, I'd like to get inside.

36:06.247 --> 36:08.916
There's no time. I'll explain later.
Just send units.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.418
Dembe, talk to me.

36:11.127 --> 36:12.461
Dembe.

36:21.429 --> 36:22.763
<i>Step away.</i>

36:34.233 --> 36:36.152
[dramatic music playing]

36:36.235 --> 36:37.445
<i>It's okay, Raymond.</i>

36:39.113 --> 36:40.531
What have you done?

36:40.615 --> 36:42.533
[Townsend] <i>Aren't you the loving couple?</i>

36:43.034 --> 36:45.786
<i>First, he comes to save you, and now you--</i>

36:45.870 --> 36:48.664
You come to save him, or try to.

36:48.748 --> 36:50.708
I'm afraid you're too late.

36:50.791 --> 36:52.210
Is there an antidote?

36:52.293 --> 36:54.128
<i>The answer is no!</i>

36:58.049 --> 36:59.383
I won't ask twice.

37:01.886 --> 37:03.054
Give it to him.

37:07.099 --> 37:08.643
[gasping]

37:13.814 --> 37:15.024
What's wrong?

37:16.317 --> 37:18.277
I paralyzed his diaphragm.

37:19.946 --> 37:22.114
You came here to save him.

37:22.740 --> 37:24.617
He came here to save himself.

37:25.326 --> 37:27.036
You look at the cause.

37:27.119 --> 37:28.663
I only see the effect.

37:29.372 --> 37:32.041
I'm standing here
while he can barely breathe.

37:33.292 --> 37:35.503
Would Townsend do that for you?

37:37.088 --> 37:38.005
Would anyone?

37:38.714 --> 37:39.799
[Raymond gulps]

37:43.177 --> 37:45.680
I want to know exactly
what you did to him.

37:52.770 --> 37:55.439
[suspenseful music playing]

37:58.901 --> 38:00.403
Tell us about Townsend.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.532
Where he is.

38:05.324 --> 38:06.909
How you contact him.

38:23.175 --> 38:24.969
I don't want you to suffocate.

38:27.221 --> 38:30.266
I have the antidote
and I will give it to you.

38:31.809 --> 38:34.520
But not until you tell us
what we need to know.

38:57.835 --> 39:01.839
Hey, call the EMTs, and search
the building for Reddington and Dembe.

39:04.675 --> 39:07.386
Donald Ressler, FBI.
I'm gonna get you medically cleared,

39:07.470 --> 39:10.556
and then whatever you told Reddington
about Townsend,

39:10.639 --> 39:12.266
well, you're gonna tell me.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.237
Sir?

39:26.155 --> 39:27.490
I'm sorry to wake you.

39:28.699 --> 39:30.076
They're ready for you.

39:45.007 --> 39:46.092
[grunting]

39:49.637 --> 39:50.763
Do you believe her?

39:51.514 --> 39:55.476
That Townsend paid her in cash
and always used a burner phone?

39:56.435 --> 39:57.937
I don't know, I suppose.

39:58.771 --> 40:00.064
I heard from Park.

40:00.147 --> 40:03.150
The video link to Townsend was encrypted.

40:03.234 --> 40:07.279
They're going to try and trace it,
but they're not optimistic.

40:07.947 --> 40:11.242
All of this and going after Perillos
got us nothing.

40:13.327 --> 40:15.704
I think we both know that's not true.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.207
We came for each other.

40:23.045 --> 40:25.131
Do you think that I see your pain?

40:31.345 --> 40:32.179
Do you?

40:33.097 --> 40:33.931
No.

40:36.517 --> 40:38.102
I don't. Not always.

40:42.523 --> 40:43.774

40:54.326 --> 40:55.411
How's the patient?

40:55.953 --> 40:58.205
-He'll be okay.
-Thanks to you.

40:58.873 --> 41:00.458
Good detective work.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.627
-I told you we'd find him.
-You were right.

41:04.378 --> 41:05.421
But so was I.

41:06.630 --> 41:09.842
He lives at the edge,
and one day he will go over it.

41:10.843 --> 41:13.679
You need to be prepared
for when that happens.

41:17.433 --> 41:20.895
We went to Ruddiger's apartment.
He wasn't there.

41:23.439 --> 41:24.773
I got nothing. You?

41:27.651 --> 41:29.153
I left him tied.

41:29.236 --> 41:30.738
Well, he wasn't there.

41:33.032 --> 41:34.408
Neville, that's enough.

41:35.618 --> 41:37.077
That's enough, Neville!

41:57.264 --> 41:58.516
I want you to know...

41:59.642 --> 42:02.436
you're only alive because of Keen.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.313
You understand that, Ruddiger?

42:04.396 --> 42:07.149
She begged me to spare your life.

42:07.233 --> 42:09.818
A life which I now own.

42:09.902 --> 42:11.487
Welcome to the family.

42:12.446 --> 42:13.822
Don't fail me again!
