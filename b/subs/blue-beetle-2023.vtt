-Sorry.

13:19.106 --> 13:20.601

don't you?

13:20.737 --> 13:25.611
So, this... [exhales] project
was shut down years ago.

13:25.746 --> 13:27.545
Why have you relaunched it?

13:27.681 --> 13:30.582
[chuckling] Jennifer,
the O.M.A.C.
is the future of this company.

13:30.718 --> 13:32.250
You should be so excited.

13:32.386 --> 13:36.854
No, no, no. I really want
to know what's at Pago Island?

13:36.989 --> 13:38.918
-That's classified.
-Mm.

13:39.054 --> 13:40.322
It's a secret.

13:40.457 --> 13:41.926
But I'll tell you,
what isn't classified

13:42.062 --> 13:43.730
is what's gonna go on
at this party.

It's gonna be
an amazing evening

13:45.328 --> 13:46.791

13:46.927 --> 13:49.766

bring someone and it'll be fun.

13:59.645 --> 14:01.608
Who's "we"?

14:01.744 --> 14:04.278
You are nothing
to this company.
You're an expense.

14:06.881 --> 14:10.156

-doing your "charity work."
-My father would never--

14:12.692 --> 14:16.224
Look, your father was handed
a company I built...
my company.

14:16.359 --> 14:18.329
Which he then proceeded
to almost sink

14:18.465 --> 14:21.894
with his moronic inventions
and his reckless management,

14:22.030 --> 14:24.503
and then after he'd
done all that,
you know what he did?

14:24.639 --> 14:25.805
He just disappeared,

14:25.941 --> 14:28.269
and left me
to pick up the pieces.

14:28.405 --> 14:31.109
Your father
abandoned this company.

14:32.713 --> 14:34.040

34:34.776 --> 34:36.113
-Not now!
-There's something on your--

34:36.249 --> 34:37.577
[Rudy] Hey, Jaime,
keep that blanket

34:37.712 --> 34:39.079
now that it touched
your<i> chorizo.</i>

34:39.214 --> 34:40.651
What is going on?

34:40.787 --> 34:42.319
You can't fly.

34:43.387 --> 34:45.355
You can't fly.
Superman can fly.

34:45.490 --> 34:48.523
Those people on that bus
were okay. They're fine.

34:48.658 --> 34:52.195
Okay. This probably
happens all the time.

34:52.331 --> 34:53.830
Yeah, she wouldn't
do this to me.

34:53.965 --> 34:56.630
Yeah, right. Okay.

34:57.365 --> 34:58.731

35:02.370 --> 35:03.635
[Rocio speaks Spanish]

35:03.771 --> 35:05.836
[in English]
I tried telling him.

35:05.972 --> 35:07.874
Okay, guys. I... I need
to go find Jenny Kord,

35:08.010 --> 35:09.912
'cause she's gonna know how
to get this thing out of me.

35:10.048 --> 35:11.411
Uh, where are my shoes?

35:11.546 --> 35:14.047
Come on, where are my... shoes.

35:14.182 --> 35:17.053
Not the 84s!

35:17.189 --> 35:18.953
These were my favorite shoes.

35:19.088 --> 35:20.357
Okay, okay.

35:20.492 --> 35:22.420
Jaime, what happened?
Where did you go?

35:22.556 --> 35:23.822
<i> Ama,</i> I don't know.

35:23.957 --> 35:25.690
I think I cut a bus in half
and then...

35:25.825 --> 35:27.965
-Cut what?
-...and flew into orbit.

35:28.100 --> 35:29.797
-[speaks Spanish, then English]
Flew into orbit?
<i> -Apa,</i> I don't know.

35:29.933 --> 35:31.868
-That's why I need Jenny. Okay?
-I am calling the police.

35:32.003 --> 35:36.041
No, no. Don't call the police.
No police.
They work for Kord.

35:36.176 --> 35:37.572
What do you think
Kord's gonna do

35:37.707 --> 35:39.475
when they figure out
that some Mexican kid

35:39.611 --> 35:42.577
has that type of military tech
inside of him?

35:43.413 --> 35:44.643
They're gonna lock his ass up.

35:44.779 --> 35:46.544
And then they're gonna
wipe our minds,

35:46.680 --> 35:47.911
so that we don't tell anybody.

35:48.047 --> 35:49.351
And it's not like
the government isn't

35:49.486 --> 35:50.750
used to locking up
Mexicans anyway.

35:50.885 --> 35:53.292
I mean, this is sci-fi shit.
This is CIA.

35:53.427 --> 35:57.789
-This is Area 51!
-Rudy, focus. What do you mean?

35:57.925 --> 36:00.624
What I'm saying
is the government and Kord

36:00.759 --> 36:02.367
are gonna be all over this,

36:02.502 --> 36:04.062
and then they're gonna
start asking for documents.

36:04.198 --> 36:07.769
And that includes you, Nana.
And that includes you, Alberto.

36:07.905 --> 36:10.206
Okay, then fine. I'm just gonna
have to go by myself then.

36:10.341 --> 36:11.939
You are not leaving this house.

36:12.075 --> 36:14.438
<i> Ama,</i> I'm 22!
Besides, what if she's
in danger?

36:14.574 --> 36:16.074
What if she's in danger?

36:16.210 --> 36:18.149
-Jaime, you flew
out of the roof.
-You don't understand.

36:18.285 --> 36:20.214
-He's into her.
-Oh, he totally is.

36:20.350 --> 36:21.616
-No, I'm not.
-Oh!

36:21.751 --> 36:23.255
-Stalked her Insta.
-Where'd I put my...

36:23.390 --> 36:25.385
She's Brazilian,
she lives at the Regent Tower.

36:25.521 --> 36:27.622
And she's single, by the way.

36:27.758 --> 36:30.189
Bit of a loner, though,
if you ask me. I mean...

36:30.325 --> 36:31.491
She's single?

36:31.626 --> 36:33.362
I thought you weren't into her.

36:33.498 --> 36:34.426
What are you doing
with my phone?

36:34.561 --> 36:35.359
You left it unlocked.

And did you know what was
gonna happen to my brother

when you stuck him with
this world destroying thing?

39:45.354 --> 39:47.485
No, I swear to you,
I had no idea
this would happen.

39:47.620 --> 39:49.155
I mean, come on.

39:49.291 --> 39:51.227
My father said it can't be
activated by just any person.

39:51.362 --> 39:52.794
It has to choose you.

39:53.895 --> 39:56.563
So I'm guessing
it's chosen you.

39:56.698 --> 39:57.963

Okay. So, how do we get it
to un-choose me?

40:01.508 --> 40:03.774
I don't know.
But we better move fast,

40:03.909 --> 40:06.003

will kill us all
just to get it back.

it would activate.

get this thing outta me?

40:57.729 --> 40:59.663
-[Rocio] Exactly.
-[Jenny exhales]

40:59.798 --> 41:02.732
There's a place where
we can get some answers.

41:03.863 --> 41:04.828
But we need the key.

41:04.964 --> 41:07.600
Okay, so where's the key?

41:07.735 --> 41:09.469
At the Kord building.

41:09.604 --> 41:11.876
And they're probably
on high alert over there
since I took the Scarab.

41:12.011 --> 41:15.542
So, what are we talking about?
Laser-based security system?

41:15.678 --> 41:17.348
Wide area motion imagery?

41:17.483 --> 41:19.782
Maybe, uh... photonic emitters?

41:20.746 --> 41:22.582
I really don't--

41:22.717 --> 41:25.255
Because I've been
working on something
that I believe can help us.

41:25.391 --> 41:27.889
And it's almost finished.

41:28.024 --> 41:29.720

You're aware that
if you deliver the O.M.A.C.,

42:05.398 --> 42:06.563
you'd be the most powerful

42:12.732 --> 42:13.934
[chuckles]

42:14.069 --> 42:15.939
General,
this is Lieutenant Carapax.

42:16.075 --> 42:18.907
He's been crucial to the
development of the prototype,

42:19.042 --> 42:21.905
and I personally handpicked him
for his courage

42:22.041 --> 42:23.714
during the anti-communist

42:23.849 --> 42:27.278
counter-terrorism operations
in Guatemala.

42:27.414 --> 42:29.753
He's the perfect recipient
for the O.M.A.C.,

42:29.889 --> 42:31.751
and a product of the school
of the Americas.

42:31.887 --> 42:33.355
Great to meet you, Lieutenant.

42:33.491 --> 42:34.691

42:34.826 --> 42:38.125
Well, can't wait to see it
in action.

42:38.260 --> 42:40.291
-When will it be ready?
-Oh, it's ready, isn't it?

42:40.427 --> 42:43.829
We're just putting some
finishing touches on it.

42:43.964 --> 42:45.533
[quietly] We have a problem.

42:45.669 --> 42:47.397
Well, if you'll excuse us.

42:47.532 --> 42:51.302
Have a cigar,
they're made by real Cubans.

42:52.809 --> 42:55.743
[Victoria] You lost her? How?

42:55.878 --> 42:57.409
My men saw someone helping her.

42:57.545 --> 43:00.281
All right. I wanna find out
who she is working with now.

43:00.416 --> 43:03.787
Because without the Scarab,
we can't complete the O.M.A.C.

43:03.922 --> 43:07.217
I'm on it.
I will bring the Scarab back.

43:07.353 --> 43:09.056
This time
I'll do it personally.

43:09.191 --> 43:11.861
Well, I would hope so,
Carapax, because if not,

43:11.996 --> 43:14.462
all your sacrifices
will have been in vain.

43:14.597 --> 43:18.196
Just think of how much
suffering your body
has been through.

43:18.331 --> 43:20.735

Where are we?

54:33.243 --> 54:35.709
[machinery humming]

54:36.782 --> 54:37.777
No way.

54:40.313 --> 54:41.446
Wait.

54:41.582 --> 54:44.487
Ted Kord was Blue Beetle?

54:46.418 --> 54:47.486
Wow!

54:47.622 --> 54:49.153
What the hell is Blue Beetle?

54:49.289 --> 54:51.893
[Rudy] Oh, you were a kid.
It's like Palmera's superhero.

54:52.028 --> 54:55.227
Like Superman in Metropolis
or the Flash in Central City.

54:55.362 --> 54:56.829
But just, uh...

54:56.965 --> 55:00.963
I don't know,
maybe just not... not as good.

55:01.099 --> 55:04.105
I can't believe
he was the Blue Beetle.

55:04.241 --> 55:05.908
Oh, I get it though.

55:06.043 --> 55:10.974
Eccentric billionaire,
a genius.
<i> El Escarabajo Azul.</i>

55:11.109 --> 55:14.414
Your dad was a great man.
I had no idea.

55:14.550 --> 55:15.914
You can call me Cesar or Rudy.

55:16.050 --> 55:18.715
You can call me whatever
you want, I don't care.

55:18.850 --> 55:20.116
Hey, how come all of this--

55:22.756 --> 55:25.160
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

55:25.296 --> 55:27.729
Um, what were you saying?

55:27.865 --> 55:30.032
Yeah, how come this stuff
doesn't look more like--

55:30.168 --> 55:32.496
Nicer? Less ridiculous?

55:32.631 --> 55:34.801
No. But I mean...

55:36.204 --> 55:40.277
Like, look at this.
It's like Batman's stuff,
but...

55:40.413 --> 55:42.176
like if he had ADHD
or something.

55:42.312 --> 55:43.907
Batman's a fascist.

55:44.043 --> 55:47.147
The Blue Beetle,
he had a sense of humor.

55:47.282 --> 55:48.617
[chuckles]

55:48.753 --> 55:51.150
My dad was never able
to unlock the Scarab.

55:51.285 --> 55:55.689
So instead, he built his own
tech to fight as Blue Beetle.

55:55.825 --> 55:58.254
If there's a way to get it out,
it's in there.

55:58.389 --> 56:00.829
-[knuckles crack]
-Let's crack into this sucker.

56:00.965 --> 56:02.664
[sniffs]

56:03.265 --> 56:04.632
[sniffing]

56:04.768 --> 56:06.869
-Damn, you stink.
-This is your shirt.

56:07.005 --> 56:09.365
Come on, I think there's some
of my dad's clothes upstairs.

56:09.501 --> 56:11.906
[Rudy] That's a good idea.
This is gonna take a minute.

56:12.042 --> 56:13.708
[typing]

56:15.881 --> 56:17.074
[sighs]

56:17.608 --> 56:19.215
Jeez.

56:19.350 --> 56:21.144
When is this day gonna end?

56:24.055 --> 56:26.050
[exhaling]

56:28.421 --> 56:29.691
Whoa.

56:30.656 --> 56:33.090
Ay. [chuckles]

56:35.399 --> 56:36.696
[Jenny] Is everything okay?

56:36.832 --> 56:40.933
Um, yes. Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be right out.

56:41.069 --> 56:44.834
Yeah, I think they, uh...
I think they fit.

56:44.970 --> 56:46.708
And they're comfy, too, so...

56:49.211 --> 56:50.981
Good.

56:51.116 --> 56:53.984
It must have been
so cool growing up
in a place like this, no?

56:54.120 --> 56:55.584
Honestly, it was...

56:55.720 --> 56:58.082
it was pretty lonely
most of the time.

56:59.284 --> 57:00.924
[Jaime] It was just
you three in here?

57:01.060 --> 57:02.018
[Jenny] Yeah.

57:02.154 --> 57:03.956
That was my mother's
last painting.

57:04.755 --> 57:06.163
Why'd she stop?

57:06.298 --> 57:08.158
My mom died when I was six.

57:10.201 --> 57:12.328
Oh... We don't...

57:12.463 --> 57:14.300
-I'm so sorry to...
-It's okay. No, it's okay.

57:14.435 --> 57:15.638
It's fine.

57:17.505 --> 57:18.707
What was she like?

57:20.046 --> 57:21.611
She was great.

57:23.643 --> 57:24.607
She was great.

57:24.742 --> 57:26.176
[sniffles]

57:27.979 --> 57:30.180
She changed my dad's life.

57:30.316 --> 57:32.419
She was the one who taught him
that the world

57:32.554 --> 57:33.923
is a place to protect.

57:34.058 --> 57:35.053
Nice.

57:37.059 --> 57:41.125
But when my mom died, he...
he really went adrift.

57:44.765 --> 57:47.063
He obsessed over the Scarab

57:47.199 --> 57:49.507
and he would disappear
for days.

57:51.208 --> 57:52.873
Sometimes weeks.

57:53.706 --> 57:55.172
And one day, he...

57:56.808 --> 57:58.274
he left and...

58:00.218 --> 58:01.618
didn't come back.

58:02.716 --> 58:04.280
I'm so sorry, Jenny.

58:08.623 --> 58:11.055
You're really lucky.

58:11.190 --> 58:15.533
This house is...
it's full of stuff.

58:16.401 --> 58:18.833
Your house is full of love.

58:20.666 --> 58:21.600
[sniffles]

58:21.736 --> 58:23.068
[voice breaking] A family.

58:24.977 --> 58:26.108
Yeah.

58:26.244 --> 58:27.611
That's a home.

58:30.247 --> 58:31.510
[crying softly]

58:31.646 --> 58:34.415
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

58:34.550 --> 58:36.150
Sorry for... for what?

58:36.286 --> 58:40.184
I... I haven't
talked about this
in a very long time.

58:42.056 --> 58:44.188
Kinda feels nice to,
maybe, right?

58:46.329 --> 58:47.697
Thank you.

58:48.132 --> 58:49.396
Yeah.

58:49.532 --> 58:51.063
You're a good listener.

58:52.803 --> 58:54.830
My mom says it's 'cause
I got big ears.

58:54.966 --> 58:57.036
[chuckling lightly]

59:03.012 --> 59:04.140
Hey, guys,
I found something that-- Ho!

59:04.276 --> 59:06.584
-Nothing happened.
-Her mom died.

59:07.753 --> 59:08.914
I found something you guys
need to look at.

59:09.049 --> 59:12.656
Uh, great.
That's great. Let's go.

59:14.360 --> 59:15.692
Nice jammies,<i> guey.</i>

59:17.293 --> 59:18.695
[sighs]

59:20.064 --> 59:23.493
[Rudy] Okay. [groans]
I've gone through the files.

59:23.629 --> 59:27.503
So... Ted had a professor,
this guy named Dan Garrett.

59:27.638 --> 59:29.801
The Scarab chose
this Garrett guy

59:29.936 --> 59:31.434
before it chose you, Jaime.

59:31.569 --> 59:34.403
And<i> pinche</i> Ted,
ran tests on him to map out

59:34.539 --> 59:37.208
how the Scarab would react
to the human body.

59:37.343 --> 59:39.743
So, once this Scarab
goes up someone's ass...

59:39.879 --> 59:41.518
It didn't go up my ass.

59:41.654 --> 59:43.517
Okay. Well, it connects
to the brain

59:43.652 --> 59:46.590
and that's what it's trying
to do to you, Jaime,
connect to your brain.

59:46.725 --> 59:48.419
It's trying to become one
with you.

59:48.555 --> 59:49.658
Why?

59:49.793 --> 59:50.923
I think you should
ask it yourself.

59:51.059 --> 59:52.658
I mean, this thing
has its own will.

59:52.793 --> 59:53.759
[Jenny] It's sentient.

59:53.895 --> 59:55.793
That's why it chooses a host.

59:55.929 --> 59:58.767
That's why sometimes,
it does what you want,
and sometimes, it doesn't.

59:58.903 --> 01:00:00.562
Okay, well, who made it?
Can they help us?

01:00:00.698 --> 01:00:02.867
[chuckles] This wasn't made
on Earth,<i> cabezon.</i>

01:00:03.002 --> 01:00:04.635
-No way.
<i> -Si</i> way.

01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:06.743
It's alien.

01:00:06.879 --> 01:00:08.406
Yeah. I don't really like
the term "alien."

01:00:08.542 --> 01:00:10.343
-You can use it, but I just--
-Whatever, Rudy. Come on.

01:00:10.479 --> 01:00:14.318
What happened
to Ted's professor guy?
How did he get it out?

01:00:14.453 --> 01:00:15.719
You might want to sit down.

01:00:18.021 --> 01:00:20.216
-Or not. All right--
-Rudy, please. Focus.

01:00:20.352 --> 01:00:22.057
I got good news
and I got bad news.

01:00:22.193 --> 01:00:24.393
The good news is,
I figured out how
to get it out.

01:00:24.528 --> 01:00:25.895
-Fine.
-[chuckles]

01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:28.292
And the bad news is
that you have to be dead.

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.765
-What?
-Dead.

01:00:30.901 --> 01:00:32.063
[Jaime] What do you
mean "dead"?

01:00:32.199 --> 01:00:33.771
[Rudy] Okay, right now,
Jaime, look.

01:00:33.906 --> 01:00:36.003
It's fusing itself
to every cell in your body.

01:00:36.138 --> 01:00:39.370
It's completely coiled
around your brain.

01:00:39.506 --> 01:00:41.776
And there's nothing on earth
that could remove it.

01:00:41.912 --> 01:00:44.544
It's designed
to protect its host.

01:00:44.679 --> 01:00:46.113
To keep it alive.

01:00:46.249 --> 01:00:48.180
So you're saying that
this thing's in me forever?

01:00:48.315 --> 01:00:50.420
-[sighing]
-[Rudy] No, it's not forever.

01:00:50.556 --> 01:00:52.316
I mean, it's just until you...

01:00:53.292 --> 01:00:54.657
until you die.

01:00:54.793 --> 01:00:56.388
[stammering]
I think it's kinda cool.

01:00:56.524 --> 01:00:59.862
No, I mean, basically,
you are a superhero,<i> cabron.</i>

01:00:59.997 --> 01:01:02.229
I'm so sorry.
I had no way of knowing--

01:01:02.364 --> 01:01:05.130
Oh, you had no idea.
So then what are
my options now?

01:01:05.266 --> 01:01:08.535
So, option one is
to become an android

01:01:08.671 --> 01:01:10.104
for the rest of my life.

01:01:10.239 --> 01:01:12.367
Or option two is to hand myself
over to a murderous

01:01:12.503 --> 01:01:14.541
-billionaire psychopath?
-I'm so sorry.

01:01:14.677 --> 01:01:16.010
All I wanted was a job.

01:01:16.146 --> 01:01:18.446
-[Rudy] Maybe there's a--
-Maybe what, Rudy?

01:01:18.581 --> 01:01:20.015
It's all bad news.

01:01:20.151 --> 01:01:21.552
Okay, this shit just doesn't
get any better for us.

01:01:21.687 --> 01:01:23.446
I don't understand
why you can't...

01:01:24.256 --> 01:01:26.317
God. [sighs]

01:01:26.452 --> 01:01:28.985
Whatever. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go for a walk.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.754
[Jenny] Jaime, just...

01:01:30.889 --> 01:01:33.088
Let me go talk to him.
I think I know
where he's going.

01:01:33.224 --> 01:01:35.865

at you, Rudy.

-I shouldn't have
yelled at you, but...
-[Rudy speaks Spanish]

01:02:10.467 --> 01:02:13.670
[in English]
It's not lost on me
that your situation

01:02:13.806 --> 01:02:16.136
is a little bit
out of the ordinary.

01:02:18.138 --> 01:02:20.310
[light chuckle] Yeah, we're...

01:02:20.446 --> 01:02:22.209
we're resilient people.

01:02:22.344 --> 01:02:26.047
Life will continue to hit us
with curve balls, and...

01:02:26.183 --> 01:02:29.414
difference is, when we
get hit, we get stronger.

01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:33.820
Look at your old man.
He brought me here from Sonora.

01:02:33.956 --> 01:02:38.521
I was ten. I think he was 19.

01:02:38.656 --> 01:02:41.260
And people think
crossing the border is hard.

01:02:41.396 --> 01:02:43.295
Yeah, it's hard,
but you know what's harder?

And you have to figure out
what you're going to do
with it.

01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:20.970
Maybe this did all happen
for a reason.

01:03:22.073 --> 01:03:25.205

that we get our own hero.

Nana is right, Mili.
We have to go and save Jaime.

01:14:45.924 --> 01:14:50.052
How? Okay,
we don't even know
where they took him.

01:14:50.188 --> 01:14:52.089
[Jenny] I might know
where he is.

01:14:56.132 --> 01:14:57.160
Please.

01:14:58.136 --> 01:14:59.195
Come with me.

I'm done, I'm done.

01:15:43.411 --> 01:15:44.810
Okay, guys.

01:15:44.946 --> 01:15:46.445

01:16:43.305 --> 01:16:47.105
[in English]
So, what's the plan
when we get there?

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:48.874
We'll burn that bridge
when we get to it.

01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:50.878
[Milagro] That's not
how you say--

01:16:52.943 --> 01:16:55.377

[Victoria] After 15 years,
everything we've done,

01:17:11.799 --> 01:17:13.829
every sacrifice we've made,

01:17:13.965 --> 01:17:16.531
has led to this moment.

01:17:16.666 --> 01:17:20.836
Finally, the power
of the Scarab will be ours.

01:17:20.972 --> 01:17:22.438
[Sanchez] Almost there.

01:17:22.574 --> 01:17:25.477

to change the world, Carapax.

Are you ready?

Wait, is that
Kabloom bubble gum?

01:17:58.644 --> 01:18:01.714
[Jenny] Oh, no, no.
That's not what
you think it is.

01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:04.381
It's just a special prototype

01:18:04.516 --> 01:18:07.686
my dad was designing for me
when I was little.

01:18:07.821 --> 01:18:09.423
Do these things work?

01:18:09.559 --> 01:18:11.893
Mm... some of them.

01:18:12.857 --> 01:18:14.126

[Milagro chuckles softly]

01:18:29.443 --> 01:18:32.782
Yeah, you know what?
I think I'm keeping this one.

01:18:36.184 --> 01:18:39.013
Okay, so, how are we
supposed to learn

01:18:39.149 --> 01:18:40.348

they took Jaime.

Pago is a Caribbean island
off the coast of Cuba

01:19:04.575 --> 01:19:07.679
that Kord bought from Batista
in the 50s.

01:19:07.815 --> 01:19:09.511
The place is a fortress.

01:19:09.647 --> 01:19:11.447
Okay, how the hell
are we gonna get in there?

01:19:11.982 --> 01:19:14.050
[in Spanish]

01:19:14.185 --> 01:19:15.350
[in English] What the hell?

01:19:15.486 --> 01:19:16.824
Mili, one day, we gonna
have to talk

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:18.458
about Nana's
revolutionary past.

Get me out of this thing,
please?

Sanchez?

You're sorry? You're sorry?
What does that even mean?

Tell her to get me out of this!

01:20:31.701 --> 01:20:33.633
It's okay. It's okay.

01:20:33.768 --> 01:20:36.299
Yeah. Listen, kid.

01:20:36.435 --> 01:20:39.701
The Scarab chose you,
that's true.

01:20:39.836 --> 01:20:45.077
But it doesn't belong to you.
It belongs to me.

01:20:45.213 --> 01:20:47.148
But now that you've
activated it,

01:20:47.283 --> 01:20:50.951
we can transfer its code
directly into the O.M.A.C.

01:20:51.087 --> 01:20:52.283
What are you
even talking about?

01:20:52.418 --> 01:20:54.752
No, no, Miss Kord.
It could kill him.

01:20:54.887 --> 01:20:56.456
Oh, bummer.

01:20:56.591 --> 01:21:00.058
Well, but sacrifices have to
be made for the greater good.

01:21:00.193 --> 01:21:03.695
And this is yours, Jaime Reyes.

01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:05.298
Do it, Sanchez.

01:21:05.434 --> 01:21:07.265
With all due respect,
my name, again, is not Sanchez.

01:21:07.401 --> 01:21:10.005

On the wall! Engage. Engage.

01:22:16.532 --> 01:22:18.170
[Rocio] Rudy, do something.

01:22:18.306 --> 01:22:20.471
Rudy, we need to move.
We need to move.

Hey! Come on.

[breathing heavily]

01:24:24.129 --> 01:24:25.629
Just let me out!

[Victoria] I'll keep it safe.

kill the kid.

Get me out of here!

But, Miss Kord,
we could learn so much

01:24:45.882 --> 01:24:47.553
from his connection
to the Scarab--

01:24:47.689 --> 01:24:48.857
We can learn a lot more
if we take it off his corpse.

01:24:48.992 --> 01:24:52.128

Okay, I think we're good.

What the...

01:25:34.169 --> 01:25:38.336
Victoria, you crazy bitch.

01:25:38.472 --> 01:25:40.407
[Milagro] What the hell
is this?

01:25:40.543 --> 01:25:42.912
[Jenny] Fully operational
O.M.A.C. systems.

01:25:43.047 --> 01:25:45.181
Enough to build an entire army.

01:25:59.188 --> 01:26:01.061
[Sanchez] Miss Kord, this...
this isn't looking good.

01:26:01.196 --> 01:26:02.428
[Victoria] What's going on?

01:26:02.564 --> 01:26:04.059
[Sanchez] Oh, no.
The Scarab download

01:26:04.195 --> 01:26:05.659

what the O.M.A.C. is.

just the way that you are now,

01:46:09.737 --> 01:46:12.099

just like your pathetic father,
