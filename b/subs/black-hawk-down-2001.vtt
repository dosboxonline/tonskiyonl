WEBVTT

03:34.547 --> 03:35.741
There.

03:36.182 --> 03:37.945
Technicals, nine o'clock.

04:03.443 --> 04:05.138
Oh, shit! Did you see that?

04:05.345 --> 04:09.441
Chief, we got unarmed civilians
getting shot down here at nine o'clock.

04:09.649 --> 04:12.812
I got it, Matt.
I don't think we can touch this.

04:20.892 --> 04:22.258
Command, Super 64...

04:22.328 --> 04:26.059
We got militia shooting civilians
at the food distribution center.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.400
Request permission to engage.

04:28.468 --> 04:30.800
Super 64, are you taking fire? Over.

04:31.371 --> 04:32.804
Negative, command.

04:32.939 --> 04:36.568
UN's jurisdiction, 64.
We cannot intervene.

04:36.676 --> 04:38.337
Return to base. Over.
Roger.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.674
64 returning.

05:28.561 --> 05:30.222
Ready, Mr. Atto.

05:41.674 --> 05:42.538
Leaving.

06:47.673 --> 06:49.402
General Garrison?

06:49.475 --> 06:50.840
No, thanks. I got one.

06:51.043 --> 06:52.806
But these are Cuban.

06:53.146 --> 06:55.046
Bolivar Belicoso.

06:55.481 --> 06:56.470
So is this.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.977
Miami, my friend, is not Cuba.

07:08.561 --> 07:11.530
I see not catching Aidid
is becoming a routine.

07:12.465 --> 07:15.400
We weren't trying to catch Aidid.
We were trying to catch you.

07:15.468 --> 07:16.298
Me?

07:16.869 --> 07:18.769
But am I that important?

07:19.138 --> 07:20.730
I hardly think so.

07:20.907 --> 07:23.933
You're just a businessman.
Trying to make a living.

07:24.143 --> 07:26.873
Yeah. Selling guns to Aidid's militia.

07:31.918 --> 07:33.408
You've been here, what?

07:34.987 --> 07:36.545
Six weeks?

07:38.658 --> 07:41.786
Six weeks you are trying
to catch the general.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.490
You put up reward posters.

07:44.997 --> 07:49.263
$25,000. What is this?
Gunfight at the KO Corral?

07:50.503 --> 07:53.495
It's the OK Corral.

07:54.006 --> 07:58.170
Do you think bringing me in will
make him suddenly come to you?

07:58.377 --> 08:00.572
Make him more agreeable?

08:03.115 --> 08:05.140
You know where he sleeps.

08:05.751 --> 08:09.243
You pay for his beds,
much less his militia.

08:11.023 --> 08:14.117
We're not leaving
Somalia till we find him.

08:15.728 --> 08:16.956
And we will find him.

08:17.029 --> 08:19.657
Don't think because I grew
up without running water...

08:19.732 --> 08:21.723
I am simple, General.

08:22.768 --> 08:25.134
I do know something about history.

08:25.705 --> 08:30.142
See all this?
It's simply shaping tomorrow.

08:30.776 --> 08:34.769
A tomorrow without a lot of
Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.

08:35.481 --> 08:38.347
Well, I wouldn't know about that.
I'm from Texas.

08:38.551 --> 08:42.681
Mr. Garrison, I think you
shouldn't have come here.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.189
This is civil war.

08:46.158 --> 08:47.989
This is our war.

08:48.728 --> 08:49.990
Not yours.

08:51.731 --> 08:54.495
300,000 dead and counting.

08:54.734 --> 08:58.067
That's not a war, Mr. Atto.
That's genocide.

08:59.572 --> 09:02.166
Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?

09:07.847 --> 09:09.610
How'd he strike you?

09:09.749 --> 09:12.877
Urbane, sophisticated, cruel.

09:12.952 --> 09:14.715
Yeah, he's a good catch.

09:15.187 --> 09:17.553
It'll take time,
but Aidid will feel the loss.

09:17.623 --> 09:20.490
I'm not sure time is something
we got in great supply.

09:20.560 --> 09:24.724
This isn't Iraq, you know.
Much more complicated than that.

09:25.164 --> 09:27.155
Boss, most of Washington might disagree.

09:27.233 --> 09:31.397
They've been calling for situation
reports every morning this week.

09:32.471 --> 09:36.805
Well, tell them the situation is fragile.

09:43.549 --> 09:45.983
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Cliff "Elvis" Wolcott.

09:46.185 --> 09:47.812
I'll be your pilot today.

09:47.887 --> 09:51.983
Federal regulations designate this
a non-smoking Black Hawk helicopter.

09:52.058 --> 09:56.392
Those in Mogadishu frequent flyer
program will earn 100 free credits.

09:56.596 --> 10:01.124
And as always, the air sickness bags
are located in the seatback in front of you.

10:02.168 --> 10:05.001
Number one indications are good, Cliff.
Put her on two.

10:05.304 --> 10:06.532
You're still clear.

10:21.754 --> 10:25.019
61, this is 64. Go to UHF secure.

10:25.257 --> 10:26.417
I've got some bad news.

10:27.593 --> 10:30.323
"Limo" is a word, Durant.
I don't want to hear about it.

10:30.596 --> 10:33.258
It is not a word.
It's an abbreviation of a word.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.434
"Limo" is a word in common usage.

10:35.601 --> 10:39.298
That is the key phrase in Scrabble,
my good friend. Common usage.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.464
If it's not in the
dictionary it doesn't count!

10:42.541 --> 10:44.634
It doesn't have to be in the dictionary!

10:44.710 --> 10:46.871
It does have to be in the dictionary!

10:46.979 --> 10:50.278
When we get back to the base,
it's coming off.

10:51.183 --> 10:53.981
You touch my "limo" and
I'll spank you, Nightstalker.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.178
Yeah, promises.

10:56.922 --> 10:58.685
That's a nice beach down there.

10:59.458 --> 11:00.447
How's the water?

11:00.960 --> 11:04.828
Yeah, it's nice and warm.
And it's loaded with sharks.

11:11.003 --> 11:12.493
Name.
Todd.

11:12.872 --> 11:14.635
Last name.
Blackburn.

11:16.442 --> 11:18.137
First name, Todd.

11:18.444 --> 11:21.277
So, what's it like?
What's what like?

11:21.480 --> 11:22.708
Mogadishu. The fighting.

11:22.848 --> 11:26.716
Serial number.
72163427.

11:27.920 --> 11:31.583
Firstly, it's "the Mog" or simply "Mog."
No one calls it Mogadishu here.

11:31.657 --> 11:35.058
Secondly, I wouldn't know about
the fighting, so don't ask.

11:35.661 --> 11:36.650
Why not?

11:37.163 --> 11:38.755
Didn't I just say, "Don't ask"?

11:41.233 --> 11:44.964
You look like you're about 12,
so let me explain something to you.

11:45.037 --> 11:48.598
I have a rare and mysterious skill
that precludes me from doing missions.

11:50.076 --> 11:51.043
Typing.

11:51.143 --> 11:53.543
Can you type?
No.

11:54.880 --> 11:58.008
Date of birth.
2-27-75.

12:03.989 --> 12:05.854
Well, I'm here to kick some ass.

12:10.696 --> 12:12.129
Let's bring it in.

12:27.813 --> 12:29.576
Nice, man! Very smooth!

12:30.015 --> 12:31.846
Single shot through the engine block.

12:32.518 --> 12:35.214
Shit, that's a shame.
That was a nice jeep.

12:58.978 --> 13:01.276
Cease fire! Cease fire!

13:01.947 --> 13:02.971
Check your weapons!

13:03.215 --> 13:04.204
Sergeant Eversmann.

13:08.587 --> 13:10.054
Private First Class Blackburn.

13:10.389 --> 13:11.378
Yeah?

13:11.991 --> 13:13.049
Reporting for duty.

13:13.726 --> 13:18.060
Not to me. You're reporting to Lt. Beales.
He should be around here somewhere.

13:18.230 --> 13:19.356
Can I leave him with you?

13:20.399 --> 13:22.390
Yeah, go ahead.

13:22.768 --> 13:24.668
You brought your weapon.
Yes, sir.

13:25.004 --> 13:26.801
Want me to shoot? I'm rested.

13:27.139 --> 13:30.040
When did you get in?
Just now, Sergeant.

13:34.947 --> 13:36.073
Hey, who's hungry?

13:58.604 --> 14:01.937
What is this, Sarg'nt?
Another taxpayer-funded Delta safari?

14:02.208 --> 14:05.200
Not if General Garrison is asking.
I'm asking.

14:06.078 --> 14:07.602
Have a nice meal, Captain.

14:12.451 --> 14:14.715
Hey, man, there's a line.
I know.

14:15.154 --> 14:18.555
Well, this isn't the back of it.
Yeah, I know.

14:19.892 --> 14:22.087
Sergeant. Sergeant.

14:22.795 --> 14:23.989
What's going on here?

14:24.063 --> 14:27.089
Some aerial target practice, sir.
Didn't want to leave it behind.

14:27.166 --> 14:29.327
I'm talking about your weapon.

14:29.435 --> 14:32.029
Delta or no Delta, that's a hot weapon.

14:32.204 --> 14:35.503
You know better than that.
Safety should be on at all times on base.

14:35.574 --> 14:37.940
Well, this is my safety, sir.

14:40.746 --> 14:43.715
Let it go, sir.
The guy hasn't eaten in a couple of days.

14:43.782 --> 14:46.615
You Delta boys are a bunch
of undisciplined cowboys.

14:47.486 --> 14:49.317
Let me tell you something, Sarg'nt.

14:49.521 --> 14:53.287
When we get on a five-yard line,
you're going to need my Rangers.

14:53.359 --> 14:55.418
Y'all better learn to be team players.

14:57.196 --> 14:58.686
We're done here.

15:08.307 --> 15:11.799
Speak up. You say this is your safety?

15:11.977 --> 15:13.808
Well, this is my boot, son.

15:14.680 --> 15:18.081
And it will fit up your ass
with the proper amount of force.

15:18.284 --> 15:21.913
Is that a Jersey accent?
I'm trying to do this, give me a break.

15:22.121 --> 15:23.986
Take those sunglasses off.

15:24.123 --> 15:26.455
Delta wants to wear Oakleys,
that's their business.

15:26.525 --> 15:28.755
I don't want to see them on you again.

15:30.529 --> 15:32.224
Is that a hot weapon?

15:37.569 --> 15:38.934
Is that your move?

15:39.104 --> 15:40.969
Is my hand on the piece?

15:41.373 --> 15:43.773
I can mate you in three whatever you do.

15:45.244 --> 15:48.543
I'd keep my eye on that queen
before counseling others.

15:49.181 --> 15:51.149
Well, she's just lying in wait.

15:55.054 --> 15:56.043
Yikes.

15:58.290 --> 16:01.282
It's good. You're really improving.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.388
If I may make a suggestion-- Observation.

16:04.596 --> 16:05.585
Go ahead.

16:05.831 --> 16:08.163
It's a children's book, right?
Right.

16:08.767 --> 16:12.897
They are not supposed to scare the
living shit out of the children.

16:13.038 --> 16:16.804
This is the part of the story where
our knight is slaying the dragon.

16:16.875 --> 16:19.537
That's scary.
Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.

16:19.611 --> 16:21.602
Thought you finished that last week.

16:22.247 --> 16:23.509
You done?

16:25.084 --> 16:28.576
Hey, we are at the
10-yard line here, men.

16:28.754 --> 16:30.244
You understand?

16:30.756 --> 16:33.247
Can you count? One, two, ten.

16:33.759 --> 16:35.920
Okay? Where are my running backs?

16:36.128 --> 16:37.925
Where are my running backs?

16:39.431 --> 16:42.559
Hey, I didn't see you
at church on Sunday.

16:42.768 --> 16:44.702
You had something more important to do?

16:44.903 --> 16:47.337
Not on Sunday, you don't. Not anymore.

16:47.406 --> 16:49.704
I will make you believe, you understand?

17:04.957 --> 17:06.356
Pretty funny, hoo-ah?

17:09.395 --> 17:12.922
It was a good impression.
I recognize myself.

17:15.401 --> 17:17.198
All right, carry on.

17:17.903 --> 17:20.736
I'd like a word, specialist.
Sir.

17:21.406 --> 17:24.898
You understand why we have a
chain of command, don't you?

17:25.077 --> 17:25.974
Roger that, sir.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.537
If you ever undermine me again,
you'll clean latrines with your tongue...

17:29.615 --> 17:32.641
Till you taste no difference
between shit and French fries.

17:32.718 --> 17:33.844
Are we clear?
Hoo-ah, sir.

17:33.919 --> 17:34.851
All right.

17:42.728 --> 17:43.752
Listen to this:

17:43.829 --> 17:48.596
If one skinny kills another his clan
owes the dead guy's clan a hundred camels.

17:48.934 --> 17:50.128
A hundred camels.

17:50.369 --> 17:52.599
Camels. I wouldn't pay one camel.

17:53.105 --> 17:55.039
Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.

17:55.874 --> 17:57.739
Is that really true, Lieutenant?

17:57.943 --> 17:59.968
Ask Sgt. Eversmann. He likes skinnies.

18:00.412 --> 18:03.040
Sgt. Eversmann,
you really like the skinnies?

18:03.482 --> 18:07.213
It's not that I like them or I don't like them.
I respect them.

18:07.386 --> 18:11.550
See, what you guys fail to realize is
the sergeant is a bit of an idealist.

18:12.191 --> 18:15.592
He believes in this mission down
to his bones. Don't you, Sergeant?

18:15.828 --> 18:19.093
Look, these people, they have no jobs...

18:19.331 --> 18:23.427
No food, no education, no future.

18:23.502 --> 18:27.097
I just figure that, I mean,
we have two things that we can do.

18:27.172 --> 18:28.696
We can help...

18:28.774 --> 18:32.210
Or we can sit back and watch the
country destroy itself on CNN.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.266
Right?

18:33.612 --> 18:36.581
I don't know about you guys,
but I was trained to fight.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.841
Are you trained to fight, Sergeant?

18:38.917 --> 18:41.715
Well, I think I was trained
to make a difference, Kurth.

18:42.888 --> 18:45.254
Like the man said, he's an idealist.

18:47.025 --> 18:49.084
Oh, wait. This is my favorite part.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.498
Stay away from the cans!

18:56.735 --> 18:59.101
Die, gas-pumper!

18:59.771 --> 19:01.568
Stay away from those cans!

19:06.478 --> 19:08.605
No, no, stay back.

19:08.680 --> 19:11.672
He's having a seizure.
Put something in his mouth.

19:11.750 --> 19:16.687
John, it's okay.
John, it's okay. It's okay.

20:03.068 --> 20:05.901
Well, he'll be fine.
But not in this army.

20:06.905 --> 20:09.567
He's out of the game.
He's epileptic, going home.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.707
I'm putting you in charge of his chalk.

20:17.149 --> 20:19.982
You got a problem with that?
No, sir.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.145
It's a big responsibility.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.781
Your men will look to you
to make the right decisions.

20:24.856 --> 20:26.915
Their lives depend on it.

20:27.993 --> 20:29.221
All right.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.864
Rangers lead the way, sir.
All the way.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.498
Good luck.

21:18.043 --> 21:22.810
A meeting of Aidid's senior cabinet
may take place today at 1500 hours.

21:23.649 --> 21:26.379
I say "may" because
we all know by now...

21:26.585 --> 21:29.850
With the intel we get on the street,
nothing is certain.

21:30.055 --> 21:32.888
This is actual intel
confirmed by three sources.

21:33.725 --> 21:36.785
Two tier-one personalities
may be present:

21:37.262 --> 21:41.289
Omar Salad, Aidid's top political advisor...

21:41.366 --> 21:43.960
And Abdi Hassan Awale, interior minister.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.027
These are the guys we're after.

21:46.905 --> 21:48.270
Today we go.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.331
Same mission template as before.

21:51.576 --> 21:55.672
1545, Assault Force Delta will
infiltrate the target building...

21:55.881 --> 21:58.076
And seize all suspects within.

21:58.283 --> 22:02.185
Security Force Rangers: 4 Ranger chalks,
under command of Capt. Steele...

22:02.254 --> 22:04.518
Will rope in at 1546...

22:04.656 --> 22:08.023
And hold a four-corner perimeter
around the target building.

22:08.560 --> 22:09.891
No one gets in or out.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.686
Extraction Force:

22:11.997 --> 22:16.525
Lt. Colonel McKnight's humvee
column will drive in at 1547...

22:16.735 --> 22:20.671
On Hawlwadig Road and hold
just short of the Olympic Hotel.

22:20.872 --> 22:22.339
Wait for the green light.

22:22.541 --> 22:24.406
Now once Delta gives the word...

22:24.643 --> 22:29.342
McKnight's column will go to the target
and load the prisoners onto trucks.

22:29.915 --> 22:32.315
Immediately after the
prisoners are loaded...

22:32.484 --> 22:36.580
The four Ranger chalks will collapse
back to the target building...

22:36.822 --> 22:38.187
Load up on humvees...

22:38.390 --> 22:42.258
And the entire ground force will
exfil the 3 miles back to base.

22:42.561 --> 22:45.792
Mission time, no longer than 30 minutes.

22:46.898 --> 22:51.733
Now, I had requested light armor
and AC-130 Spectre gunships...

22:51.937 --> 22:55.998
But Washington, in all its wisdom,
decided against this.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.039
Too high-profile.

22:58.276 --> 23:01.439
So Black Hawks and Little Birds
will provide the air cover...

23:01.680 --> 23:03.875
With miniguns and 2.75 rockets.

23:04.116 --> 23:05.481
Colonel Harrell.

23:05.684 --> 23:10.018
In the C-2 bird, Colonel Matthews
will coordinate the air mission...

23:10.522 --> 23:13.355
And I will coordinate ground forces.

23:13.692 --> 23:14.989
Colonel Matthews.

23:15.060 --> 23:18.359
Mission launch code word is Irene.

23:18.830 --> 23:19.819
Questions?

23:23.068 --> 23:24.399
Which building is it, sir?

23:24.936 --> 23:28.531
We're confirming that now.
Somewhere near the Bakara market.

23:31.176 --> 23:34.168
I don't choose the time
or place of their meetings.

23:34.346 --> 23:36.143
I didn't say a word, sir.

23:36.448 --> 23:39.849
Make no mistake, once you're
in the Bakara market...

23:39.918 --> 23:42.318
You're in an entirely hostile district.

23:42.854 --> 23:45.220
Don't underestimate their capabilities.

23:45.457 --> 23:49.052
We'll be in friendly neighborhoods
before we hit the market...

23:49.194 --> 23:53.893
So remember the rules of engagement:
No one fires unless fired upon.

23:54.065 --> 23:56.329
Now, let's go get this thing done.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.063
Good luck, gentlemen.

24:04.009 --> 24:06.944
What's the matter, Danny?
Something you don't like?

24:07.145 --> 24:09.340
No Spectre gunships,
daylight instead of night...

24:09.514 --> 24:12.005
Afternoon when they're
all fucked up on khat...

24:12.184 --> 24:16.348
Only part of the city Aidid can mount
a counter-attack on short notice....

24:16.721 --> 24:19.622
What's not to like?
Life's imperfect.

24:19.825 --> 24:23.556
For you two, circling above it at 500 feet,
it's imperfect.

24:23.795 --> 24:27.458
Down in the street, it's unforgiving.

25:03.635 --> 25:04.932
What the fuck, Smith?

25:05.904 --> 25:07.804
Well?
Well, what?

25:07.973 --> 25:09.440
We going?

25:10.809 --> 25:14.575
Why should I tell you that?
Because I'm me.

25:15.914 --> 25:19.611
Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.

25:19.818 --> 25:21.342
Bakara market.
All right.

25:21.586 --> 25:25.420
Listen, Smith, I need you to back
me up out there today, all right?

25:25.624 --> 25:26.818
Keep sharp.

25:29.494 --> 25:31.621
Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.

25:31.830 --> 25:34.196
Ev, it's going to be nothing, man.

25:34.833 --> 25:36.130
Nothing.

25:39.004 --> 25:44.340
It's all in the grind, Sizemore.
Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

25:44.943 --> 25:47.138
This, my friend, is a science.

25:48.013 --> 25:50.846
You're looking at the guy
that believed the commercials.

25:51.049 --> 25:53.176
About "be all you can be."

25:53.385 --> 25:56.183
I made coffee through Desert Storm.

25:56.488 --> 25:59.685
I made coffee through Panama,
while everyone else got to fight...

25:59.891 --> 26:01.722
Got to be a Ranger.

26:02.427 --> 26:07.262
Now it's "Grimesy, black, one sugar"
or "Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?"

26:11.136 --> 26:13.627
What happened to you?
Ping-Pong accident.

26:14.005 --> 26:14.994
What?

26:15.974 --> 26:17.339
So guess what.

26:17.943 --> 26:20.741
Your wish has been granted.
You're going out today.

26:20.946 --> 26:22.573
You're fucking me.

26:22.814 --> 26:25.282
You're taking my place
assisting the 60 gunner.

26:25.483 --> 26:28.646
Sergeant Eversmann said to
get your stuff and get ready.

26:29.821 --> 26:31.789
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

26:31.957 --> 26:33.288
Oh, yeah.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.151
Hell, yeah.

26:36.361 --> 26:40.024
Grimesy, stick with Waddell and
give him ammo when he needs it.

26:40.098 --> 26:41.395
Hoo-ah?
Hoo-ah.

26:41.499 --> 26:45.993
I wouldn't worry about that.
Generally speaking, Somalis can't shoot for shit.

26:46.204 --> 26:50.140
Just watch out for the sammys
throwing the rocks, and you'll be fine.

26:50.342 --> 26:51.468
Might even be fun.

26:51.543 --> 26:55.445
D-boys do their thing now.
All we got to do is cover them.

26:55.513 --> 26:58.414
Choppers going to cover us,
and we'll be all right.

26:59.284 --> 27:03.152
Look, you guys,
this is my first time as chalk leader...

27:03.388 --> 27:06.789
But, this isn't our first time out together.
This is serious.

27:06.958 --> 27:10.394
We're Rangers, not some sorry-ass JROTC.

27:10.962 --> 27:12.224
We're elite.

27:12.931 --> 27:15.058
Let's act like it out there. Hoo-ah?

27:16.201 --> 27:17.896
Any questions?

27:24.309 --> 27:25.970
We're going to be okay.

27:26.811 --> 27:28.642
Grab your gear. Let's move out.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.993
You're not going to need that, dude.
We're not out there long enough.

28:00.979 --> 28:02.378
You won't need that, either.

28:02.914 --> 28:04.814
We'll be back before dark.

28:05.050 --> 28:07.610
You might as well take
dope and beer instead.

28:07.786 --> 28:09.083
What?

28:09.287 --> 28:11.221
Ammo, dude. Take ammo.

28:18.763 --> 28:22.130
Let me tell you something, Grimes.
You got 50 pounds of gear.

28:22.333 --> 28:23.425
You don't need another 12.

28:23.568 --> 28:28.005
I don't know about you,
I don't plan on getting shot running away.

28:28.073 --> 28:29.597
Well, I better keep mine in.

28:29.808 --> 28:30.672
Grimes.

28:30.909 --> 28:32.934
Most important thing:

28:33.078 --> 28:36.343
Remember, when everyone is shooting,
shoot in the same direction.

28:44.622 --> 28:48.319
Look at this.
He's taping his blood type to his boots.

28:48.493 --> 28:52.020
That's bad luck.
No, it's smart.

28:52.330 --> 28:54.127
All Delta do that.

28:54.933 --> 28:56.924
That's bad luck too, man.

28:57.435 --> 28:58.561
Come on, let's go.

29:02.140 --> 29:04.973
It's a good thing you're
right-handed, Adonis.

29:07.112 --> 29:11.310
If not, I don't know what you'd do.
You're a funny guy, man.

29:12.951 --> 29:15.749
I'm not taking no death letter.
We have a deal.

29:18.556 --> 29:20.547
I'll give it to you back in an hour.

29:20.792 --> 29:24.990
Blackburn, you okay?
Excited.

29:26.464 --> 29:29.956
In a good way.
I've been training my whole life for this.

29:30.335 --> 29:32.360
You ever shot at anybody before?

29:32.937 --> 29:33.926
No, sir.

29:35.540 --> 29:36.768
Me neither.

30:11.009 --> 30:12.476
Think he's reliable?

30:12.544 --> 30:16.071
Well, we'll see.
It's his first time out.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.623
Tell him to turn his damn radio off.
Yes, sir.

30:26.691 --> 30:28.522
Tell him to turn his radio off.

30:28.593 --> 30:31.585
Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.

30:37.902 --> 30:42.566
Hi. You've reached Stephanie and Randy,
leave us a message. Thank you.

30:44.909 --> 30:47.343
Hey, baby, it's me. Are you there?

30:48.913 --> 30:50.904
Pick up if you're there.

30:51.783 --> 30:54.752
I'm just calling to make
sure everything's all right.

30:55.353 --> 30:57.787
I'll call you in a couple hours.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.757
You'd better not be sleeping.

31:01.759 --> 31:03.056
Your move, Randy.

31:04.796 --> 31:06.320
I'm missing you.

31:07.365 --> 31:09.128
I love you, baby.

31:10.568 --> 31:11.899
Hello? Hello?

31:14.138 --> 31:15.366
Thanks, bud.

31:17.742 --> 31:19.642
You know, it's kind of funny.

31:20.245 --> 31:23.373
Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.

31:24.716 --> 31:27.014
Could almost be a good place to visit.

31:27.151 --> 31:28.550
Almost.

31:32.156 --> 31:34.283
You don't think we should be here.

31:35.226 --> 31:39.686
You know what I think?
It don't really matter what I think.

31:41.032 --> 31:45.401
Once that first bullet goes past your head,
politics and all that shit...

31:45.570 --> 31:47.697
Just goes right out the window.

31:48.339 --> 31:50.500
I just want to do it right today.

31:51.142 --> 31:54.976
Just watch your corner.
Get all your men back here alive.

32:20.204 --> 32:24.038
Now, is this supposed to be the place,
or did his car just take a dump?

32:24.242 --> 32:25.675
Abdi, come in.

32:26.177 --> 32:28.645
Abdi, can you hear me?
Is this the place?

32:32.984 --> 32:34.178
Abdi, come in.

32:39.490 --> 32:42.084
Can you hear me? Abdi.

32:42.860 --> 32:45.852
Abdi, come in.
Is this the place?

32:46.064 --> 32:48.532
To my right side, above the cafe.

32:48.900 --> 32:51.164
He says this is the building.

32:51.402 --> 32:52.835
He's certain?

32:53.438 --> 32:55.269
Abdi, you need to be sure.

32:55.506 --> 32:56.871
Are you sure?

32:58.543 --> 33:02.877
Well, it's down the road,
two blocks over on my left.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.715
But there's too many militia.

33:06.284 --> 33:08.616
If I go closer, they might shoot me.

33:08.987 --> 33:12.115
Now he's saying the building's
a couple blocks down...

33:12.323 --> 33:14.689
But if he's seen outside it, he'll be shot.

33:15.493 --> 33:17.654
I'll fucking shoot him myself.

33:17.862 --> 33:21.389
Tell him I want his skinny ass
parked in front of the building.

33:21.466 --> 33:24.629
He's not getting paid
till he does exactly that.

33:24.836 --> 33:28.033
Three miles to the target.
We're never off the main roads.

33:28.106 --> 33:31.303
At K-four traffic circle, we turn north,
then east on National...

33:31.376 --> 33:34.573
And we wait until extraction
of prisoners is complete here.

33:34.645 --> 33:36.613
Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig...

33:36.681 --> 33:40.208
Load the prisoners, the assault-blocking
forces and bring them back.

33:40.952 --> 33:43.113
Home in an hour. Okay?

33:43.321 --> 33:46.620
There will be some shooting.
Bakara market is the Wild West.

33:46.691 --> 33:49.956
But be careful what you shoot at.
People do live there.

33:50.561 --> 33:51.823
Hoo-ah.

34:03.775 --> 34:07.973
Last one of these guys shot himself
in the head playing Russian roulette.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.956
Sir, the vehicle is stopped.

34:24.762 --> 34:28.163
So this is the real deal now.
He's sure this time.

34:29.167 --> 34:33.263
He sounds scared shitless.
Good. That's always a good sign.

34:44.681 --> 34:46.842
That's it. That's our signal.

34:47.018 --> 34:48.349
All right.

34:48.853 --> 34:51.617
All QRF out of the airspace.

34:53.024 --> 34:55.150
All QRF out of the airspace.

35:00.031 --> 35:04.491
All units, lrene. I say again, lrene.

35:12.043 --> 35:16.605
Check in when ready. Barber 51 up and ready.
Star 41 up and ready.

35:16.881 --> 35:18.075
Irene!

35:18.749 --> 35:20.216
Copy, Irene.

35:21.085 --> 35:22.382
Fucking Irene!

35:36.267 --> 35:37.097
Come on.

35:43.841 --> 35:45.001
Good luck, boys.

35:45.076 --> 35:46.509
Be careful.

35:46.911 --> 35:49.004
No one gets left behind.

35:50.915 --> 35:52.246
What's wrong?

35:53.084 --> 35:56.247
Nothing.
He's just never done that before.

35:57.255 --> 35:58.722
Aw, fuck!

36:02.860 --> 36:04.020
Let's go.

36:05.029 --> 36:07.793
Sergeant Struecker.
Let's roll.

38:46.991 --> 38:48.322
Two minutes.

38:49.493 --> 38:50.926
Two minutes.

39:36.073 --> 39:38.667
Why are they burning tires?

39:38.976 --> 39:41.809
Signals to the militia
that we're coming!

39:43.981 --> 39:47.314
Okay, 56, looks like there's
some friendlies on the ground.

39:47.451 --> 39:50.443
Looks like I've got
a tally on the voice.

39:56.961 --> 39:58.258
One minute.

39:59.630 --> 40:00.858
One minute.

40:05.269 --> 40:06.600
What's that for?

40:07.905 --> 40:10.874
Last rope, I almost bit my tongue off.

40:42.406 --> 40:43.771
Touching base.

40:47.611 --> 40:49.238
Two feet, one foot...

40:51.015 --> 40:52.346
Clear.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.443
Little birds touching down at target.

41:41.031 --> 41:42.089
Ropes!

41:43.367 --> 41:45.858
Go! Go! Go!

41:52.910 --> 41:56.573
Chalk One troops are on the deck.
Chalk Two deployed.

41:56.747 --> 42:00.080
This is McKnight.
Uniform 64 approaching staging area.

42:11.829 --> 42:13.387
Down! Get down!

42:13.631 --> 42:15.360
Down! Stay down!

42:15.566 --> 42:17.295
Get down! Everybody down!

42:17.368 --> 42:18.801
You, down!

42:19.003 --> 42:20.027
Get down!

42:20.104 --> 42:21.128
On the floor.

42:27.478 --> 42:28.911
Let's go, let's go!

42:30.314 --> 42:32.680
Grimesy! No fear!

42:32.917 --> 42:34.748
Oh, yeah, right!

42:38.489 --> 42:41.322
Rangers securing perimeter.
Four corners.

42:41.659 --> 42:44.253
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

42:44.929 --> 42:46.920
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

42:46.997 --> 42:48.328
Well, shoot back!

42:52.136 --> 42:55.230
This is 64. Chalks on the ground,
going into holding pattern.

42:55.306 --> 42:58.104
This is 62, delivered chalks.
Going to cover pattern.

42:58.175 --> 43:02.271
Super 62, take up an overhead
pattern to provide sniper cover. Over.

43:02.446 --> 43:05.847
This is Super 65. Chalks on the ground,
going into holding pattern.

43:12.022 --> 43:15.150
Go, Blackburn, go! Go!

43:15.492 --> 43:16.754
Go, Blackburn!

43:19.263 --> 43:20.457
RPG!

43:20.664 --> 43:22.131
Hold on!

43:25.102 --> 43:26.296
No!

43:36.780 --> 43:38.805
C-2, we got a man fallen.

43:39.416 --> 43:41.907
Super-61, you're a sitting duck.

43:42.319 --> 43:45.516
Take up overhead pattern to
provide sniper cover. Over.

43:45.756 --> 43:48.020
Roger that. 61 coming out.

43:49.259 --> 43:53.593
13, go ahead. I need you to
move to the north of the street.

43:53.831 --> 43:56.425
Right to the north. Right there. Over.

43:57.735 --> 43:59.498
Doc! Doc Schmid!

43:59.903 --> 44:01.268
Come on!

44:01.505 --> 44:04.030
Schmid, we got a man hit.

44:06.010 --> 44:08.945
Where's he hit?
He's not. He fell.

44:09.013 --> 44:10.981
What?
He fell.

44:14.218 --> 44:16.015
Why aren't you shooting?

44:16.220 --> 44:18.051
We're not being shot at yet!

44:18.288 --> 44:19.687
How can you tell?

44:19.857 --> 44:21.449
A hiss means it's close.

44:21.525 --> 44:22.958
A snap means--

44:23.193 --> 44:24.990
Now they're shooting at us!

44:33.737 --> 44:34.965
Galentine!

44:38.809 --> 44:41.403
Get me Captain Steele!
Get me Captain Steele!

44:41.812 --> 44:45.111
Juliet 64, this is Juliet 25.
Come in. Over.

44:45.249 --> 44:47.080
Blackburn, can you hear me?

44:47.284 --> 44:50.412
Juliet 64, this is 25. Come in. Over.

44:50.721 --> 44:52.154
I can't get him!

44:53.157 --> 44:56.649
Juliet 64, this is Chalk Four!
We've got a man down!

44:56.760 --> 44:58.751
We need to get him out of here! Over.

44:58.829 --> 45:01.923
This is 64. Say again, 25. Over.

45:02.700 --> 45:05.191
We've got a man down! Over.

45:06.770 --> 45:09.967
Take a breath, 25, and calm down. Over.

45:10.441 --> 45:13.137
Man down!
Missed that, 25.

45:13.210 --> 45:15.041
Fuck it.
Say again.

45:15.112 --> 45:17.342
Matt, it's a long way to the humvees!

45:17.414 --> 45:20.815
We'll get a stretcher in here.
Get him to the target building.

45:21.051 --> 45:22.416
What did he say?

45:22.619 --> 45:26.453
Super 61, we got a man
wounded on the ground.

45:27.291 --> 45:30.226
Stretcher!
Get me a stretcher!

45:30.461 --> 45:32.292
Come on. Stretcher.

45:32.463 --> 45:33.828
Come on, come on!

45:34.732 --> 45:36.290
Grab this end!

45:37.668 --> 45:39.295
Let's go!

45:40.137 --> 45:42.105
All right.
Go.

45:42.406 --> 45:44.874
Get him to the humvees.
We'll hold down the corner.

45:44.942 --> 45:46.739
Up to the humvees! Now!

45:50.314 --> 45:52.475
Go! Go!

45:54.351 --> 45:56.478
Keep moving, Grimes! Run!

46:01.325 --> 46:03.020
Secure!
Let's move out!

46:03.093 --> 46:05.288
Everybody up! Let's go!

46:05.529 --> 46:06.860
Come on!

46:06.930 --> 46:08.591
Let's go! Let's move!

46:11.769 --> 46:14.294
Grimes, run!
All right.

46:17.107 --> 46:21.043
C-2, this is Super 61,
beginning my orbit of the target area.

46:21.278 --> 46:24.543
Chalk Four, clear for a clear. Coming in.

46:25.816 --> 46:29.877
Kilo 11, this is 61,
providing cover for prisoner extract. Over.

46:30.120 --> 46:31.815
Kilo 64, green light.

46:32.156 --> 46:35.455
Ready for extraction. Over.
Roger that. Will relay.

46:35.626 --> 46:37.958
That's it. We got them.

46:38.629 --> 46:41.530
Uniform 64, ready for extraction. Over.

46:41.932 --> 46:44.560
Roger that. There's the call.
Let's move out!

46:44.768 --> 46:46.599
Let's move out!
Hold on.

47:08.725 --> 47:11.319
How much longer?
Five minutes, sir.

47:11.395 --> 47:12.987
What?
Five minutes.

47:13.063 --> 47:14.690
Nothing takes five minutes!

47:20.204 --> 47:21.637
What happened to him?

47:21.705 --> 47:25.038
He fell! Missed the rope!
How'd he do that?

47:25.876 --> 47:29.039
Put him in that humvee!
Grimes, give him a hand!

47:29.479 --> 47:31.379
Let's go! Let's move it!

47:31.548 --> 47:33.709
Move, move! Come on! Move!

47:35.886 --> 47:37.251
Get him in there!

47:37.321 --> 47:38.811
Get ready to move!

47:39.389 --> 47:41.380
Go! Everybody move! Move!

47:42.259 --> 47:44.022
Get the fuck up!

47:44.561 --> 47:46.586
Grimes! Come on!

47:47.497 --> 47:49.158
Grimes! Grimes!

47:57.074 --> 47:58.837
Fuck this!

48:22.032 --> 48:23.192
Fuck!

48:28.906 --> 48:30.100
Let's go.

48:30.707 --> 48:31.901
Come on!

48:32.709 --> 48:34.142
Go! Move it!

48:34.378 --> 48:35.367
Move!

48:35.545 --> 48:38.742
Romeo 64, I need to send out
three humvees with a casualty.

48:38.815 --> 48:40.874
He looks real bad.
I need to evac now.

48:41.051 --> 48:42.416
Roger that, Uniform 64.

48:42.653 --> 48:45.178
We'll chop a team of gun ships to you.
Over.

48:45.255 --> 48:46.813
Roger that.

48:47.257 --> 48:49.487
I need extra security on these humvees!

48:49.559 --> 48:52.653
I'll go. I'll take my team,
make sure they get back okay.

48:52.729 --> 48:53.753
Do it.

48:53.997 --> 48:56.056
Struecker, you're lead humvee.

49:01.104 --> 49:04.335
First three vehicles mount up,
we're moving back to base.

49:05.676 --> 49:06.938
Move out!

49:24.294 --> 49:26.785
How are things going?
Things okay there, Struecker?

49:26.863 --> 49:29.127
I don't want to talk
about it now, Colonel!

49:29.199 --> 49:30.564
I'm busy.

49:59.162 --> 50:00.754
Sergeant Pilla's hit!

50:01.832 --> 50:03.732
Christ, he's fucked up!

50:03.900 --> 50:05.265
Is anyone hit?

50:05.736 --> 50:07.169
Struecker, talk to me!

50:07.237 --> 50:08.932
It's Sergeant Pilla!

50:09.406 --> 50:10.930
What's his status?

50:11.908 --> 50:13.307
What's his status?

50:13.944 --> 50:15.241
He's dead.

50:16.279 --> 50:17.576
He's dead.

50:17.748 --> 50:19.238
Pilla's dead, sir.

50:21.585 --> 50:26.522
C-2, this is McKnight.
We have a KIA Dominick Pilla. Over.

50:27.024 --> 50:28.514
Roger that.

50:29.192 --> 50:31.183
Get on that 50!

50:31.428 --> 50:33.623
Someone get on that 50!

50:33.864 --> 50:35.263
It's mine.

51:21.578 --> 51:24.843
Three guys with RPGs,
coming up on your side now!

51:32.089 --> 51:33.454
Stay with it!

51:34.424 --> 51:37.120
This is 61. I'm hit. I'm hit.

51:37.794 --> 51:42.094
Super 61 is hit. He is hit.
Wolcott's bird is hit.

51:44.367 --> 51:46.927
You want to pull those
PCLs off-line or what?

51:47.137 --> 51:48.434
Right, babe.

51:49.439 --> 51:50.428
Come on.

51:57.447 --> 51:58.778
61, going down.

51:58.949 --> 52:00.211
61 going down.

52:00.283 --> 52:02.717
61 is going down.

52:04.154 --> 52:06.486
Super 61 is going down.

52:07.023 --> 52:08.991
Super 61 is going down.

52:09.226 --> 52:12.059
61 is going down.
I repeat, it's going down.

52:12.229 --> 52:14.026
61's going down.

52:16.399 --> 52:17.923
Hold on!

52:40.557 --> 52:43.424
We got a Black Hawk down.
We got a Black Hawk down.

52:44.761 --> 52:47.924
Super 61 is down.
We got a bird down in the city.

52:48.131 --> 52:50.099
Super 61 is on the deck now.

52:51.101 --> 52:53.695
Get an MH-six on site.
Check for survivors.

52:53.937 --> 52:55.768
Send in the SAR bird.

52:55.972 --> 52:59.738
I want ground forces to move and secure
a new perimeter around that crash site.

52:59.809 --> 53:01.868
Can you guide the convoy in there?

53:01.945 --> 53:03.071
Roger that.

53:03.146 --> 53:04.477
Well, move quick.

53:05.582 --> 53:08.050
The whole city will be
coming down on top of them.

53:08.885 --> 53:12.719
Star 41, come inbound and see if
you can land at the crash site.

53:12.923 --> 53:15.255
Roger that. Star 41 inbound.

53:27.270 --> 53:29.067
We just lost the initiative.

53:35.845 --> 53:37.278
25, this is 64. Over.

53:37.914 --> 53:39.279
25. Over.

53:39.916 --> 53:43.181
25, Chalk Four is closest to the crash site.
Over.

53:43.420 --> 53:45.911
64, I can't see the crash site. Over.

53:46.756 --> 53:49.418
25, it's due east of you. You will find it.

53:49.593 --> 53:53.393
Leave a security element in place.
Take the rest of your chalk to the crash.

53:53.463 --> 53:56.830
Check for survivors. Secure the area.
All other chalks will follow.

53:59.436 --> 54:01.529
25, do you read me? Over.

54:02.205 --> 54:04.537
Galentine! Schmid!

54:04.708 --> 54:05.800
Get Yurek.

54:06.042 --> 54:07.304
Get Twombly.

54:07.577 --> 54:09.875
Hey, there's a Black Hawk down.

54:10.046 --> 54:11.843
Twombly, Nelson, stay here.

54:11.982 --> 54:14.883
Hold this corner and then
exfil with the humvees.

54:15.085 --> 54:18.919
Galentine, Schmid, you're coming with me.
Let's go.

54:19.422 --> 54:21.515
How come I got to stay back here?

54:21.658 --> 54:23.387
Because you're dependable.

54:24.561 --> 54:25.823
All right...

54:27.530 --> 54:28.861
Let's go!

54:34.104 --> 54:36.004
I hate being dependable, man.

54:50.453 --> 54:53.980
Juliet 25, hostiles advancing,
parallel west to your position.

54:54.090 --> 54:56.354
Women and children among them. Over.

54:56.459 --> 54:57.687
Hit the wall.

55:13.810 --> 55:15.710
Incoming!

55:21.384 --> 55:22.817
Grenade!

55:38.902 --> 55:40.096
Go.

55:50.814 --> 55:52.941
We still got guys inside!

55:53.149 --> 55:54.741
I'll go to the crash.

55:54.951 --> 55:58.751
You take the rest of the team.
I'll finish loading the prisoners.

55:58.922 --> 56:01.254
No! We'll go to the crash site together.

56:01.324 --> 56:03.554
Secure the perimeter,
wait for the humvees.

56:03.626 --> 56:05.457
Roger that.
Follow my lead.

56:06.029 --> 56:08.122
Sarg'nt, are you receiving me?

56:08.198 --> 56:10.860
Yeah, I heard you.
We should be leaving soon.

56:12.736 --> 56:15.534
All right, we need to move out now!

56:15.605 --> 56:18.836
I'll finish loading the prisoners
and pick you up at the crash site!

56:18.908 --> 56:20.136
Let's move out!

56:20.210 --> 56:21.609
Moving out! Go!

56:28.752 --> 56:30.720
Get in! Get in!

56:30.920 --> 56:32.182
Move!

56:45.635 --> 56:47.159
Eight o'clock!

57:01.151 --> 57:03.449
Grimes, stay away from the walls.

57:18.368 --> 57:20.700
Grimes. You okay?

57:21.037 --> 57:22.299
Yeah!

57:24.374 --> 57:25.739
Let's go, Maddox.

57:26.209 --> 57:28.541
C-2, convoy's moving out.
Roger that.

57:28.711 --> 57:31.339
Maddox, look at these jerks!
These idiots!

57:31.581 --> 57:34.141
Go, go! Right, Maddox, right!

57:43.726 --> 57:46.217
Twombly, the convoy is leaving!

57:46.596 --> 57:48.393
Hey, Twombly!

57:49.232 --> 57:50.221
What?

57:50.433 --> 57:52.924
I think they've forgotten us.
What?

57:53.136 --> 57:54.626
It doesn't matter.

58:02.345 --> 58:07.112
63 confirm. Skinnies are moving in on all sides.
They need help now.

58:08.418 --> 58:12.184
Indigenous personnel advancing
to Wolcott crash site.

58:13.590 --> 58:14.852
Say again. Over.

58:14.924 --> 58:17.222
A lot of people closing in.

58:19.529 --> 58:22.123
How far is Chalk Four
from the crash site?

58:22.365 --> 58:25.459
Six blocks, sir.
They need to haul ass.

59:19.222 --> 59:21.190
Get down! Get down!

59:22.292 --> 59:23.987
Scotty, are you okay?

59:26.029 --> 59:27.496
No, don't go back!

59:37.240 --> 59:39.265
Get down! Get down!

59:41.678 --> 59:42.975
Technicals!

59:43.313 --> 59:44.803
Got them!

59:52.021 --> 59:53.818
Six o'clock! Move, move!

01:00:15.845 --> 01:00:17.836
Go, go, go!

01:00:23.419 --> 01:00:24.613
Go, go!

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:29.424
Come on!

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:39.629
Yurek, leaving!

01:00:42.605 --> 01:00:43.765
Come on!

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:14.856
Uniform 64, left turn. Left turn.

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:19.425
Romeo 64, I need to know before
I get to the goddamn street!

01:02:19.635 --> 01:02:22.229
You have to slow down. There's a delay.

01:02:22.438 --> 01:02:27.034
From the time directions are relayed
from surveillance to JOC, then to me.

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:30.143
We can't slow down!
We're taking heavy enemy fire!

01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:32.008
We can't slow down!

01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:35.949
Danny, I'm getting information
from Orion surveillance above.

01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:38.882
So get me my fucking
directions to the crash site!

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:42.982
Danny, hold on. I no longer have
the best view of your route.

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:45.750
Get your ass in the right place,
goddamn it!

01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:49.227
What in the hell is the
status of Struecker's humvees?

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:52.267
Colonel Harrell, ETA to base,
Struecker's column.

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:55.097
ETA to base momentarily.

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:03.377
Open the gate!

01:03:25.134 --> 01:03:27.728
Get him out! Let's go! Let's go!
Come on.

01:03:30.406 --> 01:03:31.839
Watch his head.

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:33.273
Easy.

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:43.948
Blackburn, can you hear me?
Get him to a medic.

01:04:18.454 --> 01:04:21.981
Star 41 is at the crash site
to evacuate the injured. Over.

01:04:22.058 --> 01:04:23.150
Roger that.

01:05:02.498 --> 01:05:03.863
I got you.

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:05.627
Easy.

01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:14.707
Galentine, you all right?

01:05:14.844 --> 01:05:18.610
Galentine, Kurth, with me!
Cover fire, now.

01:05:18.681 --> 01:05:20.308
Full cover!

01:05:34.797 --> 01:05:36.128
How many are in there?

01:05:36.198 --> 01:05:38.962
Two pilots are dead,
two crew chiefs are wounded!

01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:42.660
He's hurt bad. We must get out of here.
All right. Go ahead.

01:06:15.004 --> 01:06:18.701
26, this is 25.
Is that you shooting up the technicals?

01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:21.367
This is 26. Roger that.

01:06:21.444 --> 01:06:25.540
DiTomasso, take the southeast corner.
We're setting up a perimeter. Over.

01:06:25.781 --> 01:06:28.443
This is 26. Roger that.
Moving there now.

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:29.948
Move out!

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:35.088
Captain Steele, come in.

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:38.657
Go ahead, 25. This is 64.

01:06:39.028 --> 01:06:43.658
We got two wounded and we got both
the pilots dead in the chopper!

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:45.625
We need a medivac now!

01:06:46.102 --> 01:06:51.438
It's too hot to land a bird.
You must secure the perimeter first. Over.

01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:53.435
Where are the humvees?

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:56.478
Be advised, 25, the convoy will be there.

01:06:56.545 --> 01:06:59.673
They're encountering a lot of resistance.
64 out.

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:15.458
Get the 50 up!
You should see the crash directly ahead.

01:07:15.664 --> 01:07:18.132
All I see is a roadblock!

01:07:19.268 --> 01:07:21.702
I'll have to figure out another way.

01:07:46.996 --> 01:07:50.193
Give me a defensive perimeter
so we can load the wounded.

01:08:10.352 --> 01:08:12.047
Fire your weapon, Othic!

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.263
Tell my girls I'll be okay.

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:38.170
Medic!

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.108
Hoo-ah!

01:09:08.911 --> 01:09:10.902
Medic! Medic!

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:15.609
Joyce! Joyce!
Come on, help me pick him up!

01:09:17.086 --> 01:09:21.420
Get us off this fucking street!
Where's the crash site? Say again.

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:24.752
Keep going straight 200 meters.

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.086
Roger that.

01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:28.960
Let's go!

01:09:29.497 --> 01:09:31.488
Let's go, goddamn it, let's go!

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:52.310
Hey, Twombles. Come here.

01:09:56.525 --> 01:09:58.823
The humvees ain't coming back, dude.

01:09:59.461 --> 01:10:00.553
What?

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:03.864
Were we supposed to go to them?

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:06.026
I thought they were coming to us.

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:10.829
I think we're supposed to go to them.
Shit.

01:10:14.176 --> 01:10:15.734
Let's go to the crash site.

01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:16.800
Okay.

01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:20.415
Don't fire that thing so close to my head.
I can barely hear as it is.

01:10:20.482 --> 01:10:21.471
Move out.

01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:36.190
Shit! Get down!

01:10:38.334 --> 01:10:41.826
What did I just tell you?
If you do that again--

01:10:46.175 --> 01:10:48.200
You okay? Nelson.

01:10:48.844 --> 01:10:51.176
You all right?

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:54.842
Search and rescue bird on station
inserting medics.

01:11:06.662 --> 01:11:07.651
Go!

01:11:12.134 --> 01:11:13.624
Go, go!

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:19.463
Son of a bitch. C-2, this is 68.
We've been hit.

01:11:19.642 --> 01:11:22.975
Super 68, there is smoke coming
from the top of your rotor.

01:11:23.178 --> 01:11:25.305
Advise you to come out now.
Roger.

01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:27.213
Dropping last man.

01:11:29.818 --> 01:11:34.050
Art, I've got skinnies with RPGs at 12:00.
Can you see them?

01:11:34.323 --> 01:11:36.484
Got them. Give me 90 degrees left.

01:11:46.568 --> 01:11:47.830
68 coming out.

01:11:49.838 --> 01:11:52.204
Super 68 is out. Over.

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:04.677
Hey, Wilkie, what's the situation in there?

01:12:04.953 --> 01:12:06.784
Both pilots are dead.

01:12:07.623 --> 01:12:10.717
25, we can't move these guys, Matty.

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:12.724
We'll kill them just carrying them.

01:12:12.795 --> 01:12:15.195
Stabilize in here?
Roger.

01:12:15.564 --> 01:12:18.692
Stabilize in the bird.
Repeat: Stabilize in here. Over.

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:20.894
Understood, Wilkie.
We got you covered. Over.

01:12:20.969 --> 01:12:24.461
Super 64, come inbound and
take Wolcott's position.

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:27.739
Roger. 64 is inbound.

01:12:54.903 --> 01:12:56.495
Super 64, you all right?

01:12:56.572 --> 01:12:59.370
This is Super 64. We're good.

01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:02.442
You sure?
You look like you got clipped pretty good.

01:13:02.644 --> 01:13:04.635
Instrument panels are okay.

01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:08.781
No, we're good. Got a slight vibration
in the pedals, but we're good.

01:13:09.618 --> 01:13:13.987
All right, put her down on the airfield, 64.
Have it checked out just to be safe.

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:15.445
Roger.

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:22.291
I'm getting movement in these pedals.
Check the systems again.

01:13:37.479 --> 01:13:39.970
We lost the tail rotor! It's gone!

01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:41.844
64 is going down!

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:44.509
64 is going in hard.

01:13:46.355 --> 01:13:48.084
64 going down.

01:13:52.995 --> 01:13:54.860
We're going down.

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:01.735
Get Struecker's column back out there.

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:04.102
They need to get to
Durant's crash site fast.

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:06.801
Another bird down.
I want them out of there.

01:14:07.509 --> 01:14:08.476
All of them.

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:15.943
Captain Steele, we got to
move or we'll get pinned down!

01:14:16.218 --> 01:14:18.209
We're moving as fast as we can.

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:21.483
You let me do my job and you do yours.
Over.

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:32.623
Fuck! Fuck!
Ruiz stay down.

01:14:32.701 --> 01:14:33.861
I fucking knew--
Medic.

01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:37.702
Fuck this! Captain Steele,
I'll take out the threat in the window.

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:40.237
We'll rally at the gray building.
Coming through.

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:40.832
Sarg'nt!

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:42.236
All right, let's move!

01:14:48.083 --> 01:14:49.380
Cover me!

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:57.886
Let's go, let's move!
Moving out.

01:15:03.599 --> 01:15:04.122
Friendly!

01:15:04.199 --> 01:15:05.928
Friendlies coming through!

01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:08.367
Let's go, let's go! Move up!

01:15:08.604 --> 01:15:10.504
Come on, come on!

01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:12.030
Come on!

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:21.410
Move up! Go! Move up!

01:15:21.817 --> 01:15:23.546
What the fuck are you doing out there?

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:26.315
Doing my job!
We got to get to that crash site!

01:15:26.655 --> 01:15:29.453
We got to get on that street,
and we got to move!

01:15:29.892 --> 01:15:31.985
And you have got to keep up, sir!

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.321
Don't you ever give me orders, Sergeant.

01:15:34.396 --> 01:15:36.864
We are combat ineffective, understand?

01:15:37.466 --> 01:15:38.990
We got too many wounded to move!

01:15:39.067 --> 01:15:42.298
Then give me some shooters
and I'll circle us to the bird.

01:15:45.007 --> 01:15:47.498
Grimes! You're with Chalk Four?

01:15:47.676 --> 01:15:48.700
Yes, sir!

01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:52.347
All right, hook up with Delta!
Rejoin with Sergeant Eversmann.

01:15:52.915 --> 01:15:55.179
The rest of you, secure this position!

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:57.614
Treat the wounded,
we'll wait for the convoy!

01:15:57.686 --> 01:16:00.211
Then we'll rally at
the crash site. Roger!

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:01.787
My guys, let's go!

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:35.713
C-2, I have two Delta snipers,
Shughart and Gordon...

01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:38.487
Volunteering to secure crash site two.
Over.

01:16:39.127 --> 01:16:43.291
No, Super 62, negative that request.
Can't risk another bird.

01:16:45.133 --> 01:16:49.069
We don't see anything moving down there,
we don't even know if anyone's alive.

01:16:50.339 --> 01:16:53.069
A ground team is being
organized to go in now.

01:16:53.241 --> 01:16:54.970
ETA on ground team? Over.

01:16:55.143 --> 01:16:58.237
Unknown, not long.

01:16:58.413 --> 01:17:00.745
Do what you can from the air.

01:17:04.753 --> 01:17:06.516
All right, gather around!

01:17:06.655 --> 01:17:09.886
Durant's 64 is down.
We're going back in to get him!

01:17:09.958 --> 01:17:12.085
That's crazy. Is there anyone alive?

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:14.560
Doesn't matter, no one gets left behind.

01:17:14.796 --> 01:17:16.991
We're wasting time here.

01:17:17.165 --> 01:17:20.191
Refit and max out ammo and grenades,
you got five!

01:17:21.436 --> 01:17:23.267
Sizemore, where are you going?

01:17:23.338 --> 01:17:26.171
With you guys.
Not with that cast on you're not.

01:17:27.042 --> 01:17:30.341
All right, all right, all right.
Go get your k-pot.

01:17:32.614 --> 01:17:33.808
Talk to me.

01:17:34.116 --> 01:17:35.481
I can't go back out there.

01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:40.112
Thomas, everyone feels the
same way you do. All right?

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:43.519
It's what you do right now
that makes a difference.

01:17:44.559 --> 01:17:46.049
It's your call.

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:47.553
Hoo-ah?

01:17:53.735 --> 01:17:54.963
Hoo-ah.

01:18:11.319 --> 01:18:14.948
It'll probably help to wash
the blood out of the humvees.

01:18:23.932 --> 01:18:25.866
Sergeant Struecker!

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:29.868
Sergeant Struecker! Can I go, Sarge?

01:18:30.305 --> 01:18:32.205
You got some ammo?
Roger, Sarge!

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:33.966
Hop in!

01:18:51.993 --> 01:18:53.358
Wait!

01:18:54.296 --> 01:18:56.457
Let's go, Thomas. Get in!

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:21.415
Which way?

01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:29.420
That way, I think!
Not so fucking loud.

01:20:03.198 --> 01:20:04.529
Nice donkey.

01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:24.550
Rangers?

01:20:25.053 --> 01:20:26.042
Who?

01:20:26.888 --> 01:20:30.449
It's Yurek! You fucking assholes!

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:32.024
Fuck!

01:20:32.227 --> 01:20:34.787
Dude, we almost fucking killed you!

01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:38.124
Come to us!
Fuck you, come to me.

01:20:50.579 --> 01:20:51.910
Sorry, Sarge!

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.014
Dude, where the fuck have you been?

01:20:54.082 --> 01:20:55.947
Never mind, you brought NOD, right?

01:20:56.017 --> 01:20:58.349
No, I didn't and you want to know why?

01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:01.787
Because you said: "You won't need that,
we'll be back in a half-hour."

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:03.415
Well, I wasn't saying it to you.

01:21:03.491 --> 01:21:05.482
Nelson, cover this way.

01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:07.453
We'll need night vision.

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:09.929
What's the matter with you?

01:21:10.298 --> 01:21:13.062
Oh, he's deaf. It's my fault.

01:21:13.368 --> 01:21:15.632
We need to get out of here!
That way.

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:19.367
We can't be far from the crash.
Which way?

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:21.770
I thought you might know.

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:23.943
Let's move out.

01:21:29.517 --> 01:21:32.077
Nelson, Twombly?
Come in. Over.

01:21:33.154 --> 01:21:37.352
Nelson, Twombly, this is Galentine.
We need a position of the convoy. Over.

01:21:38.393 --> 01:21:40.657
I can't raise them, Sergeant.

01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:43.558
Sir, let's get the fuck
out of here and evac!

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:48.093
Let's move out.
Back to the stronghold!

01:21:48.336 --> 01:21:49.325
Come on!

01:21:51.606 --> 01:21:54.837
Ground forces have occupied several
buildings along Marehan Road...

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:56.605
But they're all spread out.

01:21:56.678 --> 01:22:01.115
Eversmann's Chalk Four has set up a
perimeter around Wolcott's crash site.

01:22:01.349 --> 01:22:03.681
DiTomasso is in the adjacent structure.

01:22:04.052 --> 01:22:07.988
Captain Steele and about 40 men, Rangers,
are here, a couple blocks away.

01:22:08.056 --> 01:22:09.580
They're banged up pretty bad.

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:14.527
He set up a casualty collection point,
I don't think they'll be able to move.

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:17.254
Sergeant Sanderson and
a small Delta team...

01:22:17.332 --> 01:22:21.200
Are moving from Steele's position
to the crash site as we speak.

01:22:32.213 --> 01:22:33.373
Draw off fire!

01:22:33.448 --> 01:22:36.508
When this asshole stops
to reload, cover me!

01:22:36.718 --> 01:22:38.151
Go!
Sir.

01:22:41.656 --> 01:22:42.623
Again!

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:49.196
Loading!

01:22:51.566 --> 01:22:53.056
Keep going!

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:55.531
I'm jammed!

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:58.172
I got it!

01:22:59.407 --> 01:23:01.170
No, shit!

01:23:13.755 --> 01:23:15.017
RPG!

01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:32.531
You all right? You okay?

01:23:32.707 --> 01:23:35.676
Yeah. I can hear bells ringing.

01:23:37.278 --> 01:23:39.508
Come on! Come on!

01:23:41.249 --> 01:23:42.238
Go!

01:23:49.457 --> 01:23:52.426
A crowd is advancing six,
seven blocks from the crash.

01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:54.825
Shughart and Gordon again
request permission...

01:23:54.896 --> 01:23:58.332
To secure until convoy arrives. Over.

01:23:58.533 --> 01:24:01.593
General, crowds are in the hundreds now.

01:24:01.836 --> 01:24:05.294
From where they are,
they can see things clearer than any of us.

01:24:05.407 --> 01:24:07.307
They know what they're asking.

01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:08.976
Let me talk to them.

01:24:09.177 --> 01:24:10.269
This is Garrison.

01:24:10.345 --> 01:24:14.611
I want to make sure that you understand
what you're asking, so say it out loud.

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:20.677
We're asking to go in and set up a
perimeter until ground support arrives.

01:24:21.022 --> 01:24:25.186
You realize that I cannot tell you when
that might be, it could take a while.

01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:28.619
Roger that.
You still want to go in there?

01:24:28.963 --> 01:24:29.759
Yes, sir.

01:24:33.768 --> 01:24:35.395
Colonel Harrell?
Yes, General?

01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:36.528
It's your call.

01:24:37.705 --> 01:24:39.195
Roger that.

01:24:40.975 --> 01:24:43.170
Goffena, put them in.

01:24:57.092 --> 01:24:58.855
Motherfucker. Motherfucker.

01:25:04.032 --> 01:25:05.021
RPG!

01:25:14.909 --> 01:25:16.501
Set up your perimeter!

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:25.943
There's a fucking rocket in him, sir!

01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:29.888
Othic, calm down, goddamn it!
There's live ordnance, now get out!

01:25:31.192 --> 01:25:33.023
Son of a bitch.

01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:37.692
All right, lift him up!
Lift him up! Easy, easy!

01:25:37.999 --> 01:25:41.093
All right, get him in there! Good, good!
Easy, easy!

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:43.827
Get in that truck and drive.

01:25:43.905 --> 01:25:45.964
But I'm shot, Colonel.
Everybody's shot.

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.133
We need the prisoners! Let's go!

01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:52.702
Surveillance says to take Hawlwadig,
then go straight.

01:25:52.947 --> 01:25:57.213
McKnight, we need you to turn
around and head back to Hawlwadig.

01:25:57.385 --> 01:25:59.649
You're shitting me!
We just came through there!

01:25:59.721 --> 01:26:01.484
There must be a better route!

01:26:01.556 --> 01:26:06.721
That's the info I'm getting from JOC,
you need to turn around and head back.

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:10.021
Roger that. Roger that.

01:26:10.498 --> 01:26:13.365
I cannot believe this shit!
Turn us around, Maddox.

01:26:13.434 --> 01:26:15.402
They're trying to get us fucking killed!

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:17.062
Just get it over with! Drive!

01:26:17.138 --> 01:26:18.127
Goddamn!

01:26:18.406 --> 01:26:20.738
Get us out of here, goddamn it, drive!

01:26:28.449 --> 01:26:29.882
Keep your foot on the gas!

01:26:29.951 --> 01:26:32.181
Keep your foot on the gas!

01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:44.756
Fuck!

01:26:47.702 --> 01:26:48.691
Shit.

01:27:04.152 --> 01:27:06.916
C-2, Shughart and Gordon
are on the deck. Over.

01:27:07.121 --> 01:27:08.088
Roger.

01:27:34.182 --> 01:27:35.740
Friendlies!

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:39.147
God, it's good to see you!

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:41.188
It's good to see you. How bad?

01:27:41.256 --> 01:27:44.157
My leg's broken and my
back feels kind of weird.

01:27:44.292 --> 01:27:46.385
We've got to get you out of here.

01:27:47.362 --> 01:27:49.193
I'm pulling him out! Cover!

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:53.589
Wait, l--

01:28:02.143 --> 01:28:03.405
I'm putting you down.

01:28:03.645 --> 01:28:06.580
C-2, we're at the 64 crash site,
securing perimeter.

01:28:06.648 --> 01:28:08.240
You all right?
Yeah, I'm good.

01:28:08.316 --> 01:28:09.749
You're locked and loaded.

01:28:09.817 --> 01:28:13.548
Any skinnies come around these corners,
you watch our backs.

01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:16.283
Where's the rescue squad?
We're it.

01:28:21.996 --> 01:28:25.090
All right, stop, stop, Maddox. Stop.

01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:27.567
Son of a bitch.

01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:30.536
Romeo 64, we're back where we started.

01:28:30.772 --> 01:28:33.468
I'm low on ammo,
I got many wounded including me...

01:28:33.541 --> 01:28:35.509
Vehicles that are barely running.

01:28:35.576 --> 01:28:38.511
Okay, Danny,
I need a no-BS assessment here.

01:28:38.946 --> 01:28:41.073
Can you get to the crash site?

01:28:41.816 --> 01:28:44.410
Colonel, I can't see shit.

01:28:48.489 --> 01:28:49.387
Negative.

01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:52.517
With the amount of wounded we have,
we'd do more harm than good.

01:28:52.593 --> 01:28:56.552
We need to come back to base,
rearm and regroup and then we can go back out.

01:28:56.631 --> 01:28:57.620
Roger.

01:28:59.467 --> 01:29:02.732
C-2, bring them back.
Get them out of there.

01:29:04.205 --> 01:29:05.797
Roger. Return to base.

01:29:06.607 --> 01:29:07.972
We're going home!

01:29:08.176 --> 01:29:10.167
Let's go. Left.

01:29:23.091 --> 01:29:26.390
Roger that. Understand.
Convoy returning to base.

01:29:31.666 --> 01:29:33.759
What's up?
They're sending them back.

01:29:33.835 --> 01:29:35.496
The convoy's headed back to base camp.

01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:37.731
Oh, now that makes sense, don't it?

01:29:38.239 --> 01:29:42.266
We need to exfil the wounded now and
get out of here before it's too late!

01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:46.171
If Colonel McKnight went back to base,
then he had a good reason.

01:29:46.347 --> 01:29:47.814
It changes nothing.

01:29:48.015 --> 01:29:49.414
All right, listen up.

01:29:49.484 --> 01:29:53.477
We're going to hold the perimeter and
we're going to hold the strongpoint.

01:29:54.255 --> 01:29:57.520
Conserve your ammo.
Only shoot at what you can hit.

01:29:59.327 --> 01:30:01.124
The convoy is going to come.

01:30:02.530 --> 01:30:03.519
We're going to get home.

01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:16.999
Loading!

01:30:25.486 --> 01:30:26.817
Loading!

01:30:27.355 --> 01:30:29.152
Randy, I need a pistol mag!

01:30:42.537 --> 01:30:43.526
Loading!

01:30:47.275 --> 01:30:48.674
Randy, last mag!

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:53.204
Gordy!

01:30:56.951 --> 01:30:57.940
Fuck!

01:31:11.432 --> 01:31:13.627
Gordy is gone, man. I'll be outside.

01:31:14.202 --> 01:31:15.328
Good luck.

01:31:36.757 --> 01:31:39.624
We need the 10th Mountain in there.
Everything they got.

01:31:39.694 --> 01:31:42.822
Pakistanis, Malays,
I want their tanks and APCs.

01:31:43.464 --> 01:31:44.863
They don't know we've gone in.

01:31:44.932 --> 01:31:49.369
We have stirred up a hornet's nest here.
We're fighting the entire city.

01:31:49.871 --> 01:31:54.535
I want every vehicle possible that's
got 4 wheels and armor. Get everything.

01:31:54.742 --> 01:31:58.041
Once they've assembled, we'll move
our men out of the hostile area...

01:31:58.112 --> 01:32:00.706
And back to the Pakistani Stadium,
the safe zone.

01:32:00.781 --> 01:32:03.306
Now, let's go.
Roger that.

01:34:40.174 --> 01:34:42.802
On your knees! Get down! Get down!

01:34:47.448 --> 01:34:51.384
Stay with me.
You just got a bullet in the leg.

01:34:55.923 --> 01:34:58.858
See where those tires are burning?
All that black smoke?

01:34:58.926 --> 01:35:02.453
Roger. I can see it,
but I can't get there. Over.

01:35:02.663 --> 01:35:05.723
Go 100 meters past it. That's the crash.

01:35:05.966 --> 01:35:08.059
Negative. You don't understand.

01:35:08.235 --> 01:35:12.763
It's roadblock after roadblock.
You have to find us another route. Over.

01:35:13.407 --> 01:35:17.036
There ain't one. The only other
route is all the way around the city.

01:35:17.111 --> 01:35:18.203
Roger that.

01:35:18.279 --> 01:35:20.770
Kilo 64, this is Kilo 11.

01:35:21.015 --> 01:35:25.475
Request permission to move to
crash site number two on foot. Over.

01:35:26.387 --> 01:35:28.412
Green light, Kilo 11.

01:35:28.489 --> 01:35:30.889
Stop the vehicle. Let me out.

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:19.565
After I'm finished with this,
I'll whip you boys up some margaritas.

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:22.507
The usual. Blended, no salt.

01:36:29.717 --> 01:36:32.914
This is Kilo 12.
We've got to change our position. Over.

01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:48.429
Eversmann, come in.

01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:49.761
Eversmann.

01:36:52.206 --> 01:36:54.538
Roger, who is this?
Sanderson.

01:36:54.608 --> 01:36:59.045
Do not-- I say again, do not fire
to the east. We are coming to you.

01:37:00.514 --> 01:37:01.640
Understood.

01:37:01.916 --> 01:37:04.350
DiTomasso and his men are
on the southeast corner.

01:37:04.418 --> 01:37:06.784
We need you on the northeast building.

01:37:06.854 --> 01:37:08.321
Roger. We'll take it.

01:37:08.923 --> 01:37:11.153
Watch out for skinnies.
They're on the rooftops.

01:37:11.225 --> 01:37:13.716
They're in prayer but
not for much longer.

01:37:17.198 --> 01:37:18.995
Hold your fire to the east.

01:37:41.088 --> 01:37:42.783
Eversmann? It's Yurek.

01:37:43.157 --> 01:37:45.557
I got Nelson and Twombly with me.

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:48.724
We got the chopper in sight.
Where are you?

01:37:48.963 --> 01:37:52.091
We're on the southwest corner.
Where have you been? Are you okay?

01:37:52.166 --> 01:37:53.030
Yeah.

01:37:54.602 --> 01:37:56.729
Hold your fire. We're coming in.

01:38:01.542 --> 01:38:02.600
We got to go.

01:38:02.676 --> 01:38:05.611
Shawn, listen!
Sergeant Yurek's going to run first.

01:38:05.779 --> 01:38:09.738
When he gets across the street,
he'll turn around and cover you as you run.

01:38:09.817 --> 01:38:13.947
Listen closely. When you get there,
you'll turn around and cover me, okay?

01:38:15.589 --> 01:38:17.921
You won't just run to
Eversmann's position.

01:38:17.992 --> 01:38:20.825
You're going to stop and
you are going to cover me.

01:38:21.328 --> 01:38:23.489
It's important you understand that.

01:38:23.964 --> 01:38:25.329
Okay, you ready?

01:38:26.133 --> 01:38:27.498
Yeah, I guess.

01:38:33.073 --> 01:38:34.631
Don't forget.
What?

01:38:35.309 --> 01:38:36.537
Don't forget.

01:38:50.057 --> 01:38:53.424
I got them in my sight, Sarg'nt.
They're coming up on the west gate.

01:38:53.494 --> 01:38:54.620
I see them.

01:38:57.564 --> 01:38:58.861
Let's move out.

01:39:01.302 --> 01:39:03.031
Can you cover us, Sergeant?

01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:04.601
We got you.

01:39:11.845 --> 01:39:13.244
Nelson!

01:39:20.054 --> 01:39:21.043
Fuck!

01:39:29.563 --> 01:39:30.552
Twombly!

01:39:32.366 --> 01:39:33.492
Smith! No!

01:39:33.634 --> 01:39:34.896
You all right?

01:39:38.238 --> 01:39:39.603
Get it off of me!

01:39:40.374 --> 01:39:41.773
Get it off!

01:39:43.077 --> 01:39:44.704
Come on, man. Come on.

01:39:45.879 --> 01:39:48.814
Doc! Need some help with Smith here!

01:39:57.224 --> 01:39:58.521
My leg! My leg!

01:39:58.592 --> 01:40:00.287
Come on, Jamie, I got you!

01:40:07.368 --> 01:40:09.393
Up, one, two, three.

01:40:10.738 --> 01:40:13.400
You're all right.
I need some pressure on this wound.

01:40:13.474 --> 01:40:14.532
My right thigh!

01:40:14.608 --> 01:40:16.303
Pressure, yeah.

01:40:16.477 --> 01:40:18.809
Are my balls okay?
You still have your balls.

01:40:18.879 --> 01:40:19.971
I need more men in here.

01:40:20.047 --> 01:40:22.641
Twombly! Nelson!

01:40:22.716 --> 01:40:25.776
Put him down.
Oh, man, that really....

01:40:27.121 --> 01:40:29.351
It really hurts!
Direct pressure on that.

01:40:29.423 --> 01:40:30.913
It's okay, it's okay.

01:40:31.492 --> 01:40:33.858
Let me see it!
All right.

01:40:34.328 --> 01:40:36.592
All right, let me get a look at that.

01:40:36.997 --> 01:40:38.396
Oh, shit!

01:40:38.599 --> 01:40:39.827
Oh, fuck!

01:40:40.034 --> 01:40:42.434
What the fuck was that?
It's all right.

01:40:42.503 --> 01:40:44.664
Hold that down. I need a medivac now.

01:40:44.738 --> 01:40:46.137
Fuck. Galentine!

01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:47.329
It's all right.

01:40:47.408 --> 01:40:49.205
Galentine! Get me Captain Steele!

01:40:50.144 --> 01:40:53.170
Sarg'nt Ruiz, how you doing?
Juliet 64, come in. Over.

01:40:53.247 --> 01:40:57.115
They're not going to come and get us.
They're not going to come for us.

01:40:57.217 --> 01:41:00.277
I need you to suck it up, Sarg'nt.
I need you to focus.

01:41:00.354 --> 01:41:02.754
Can you do that?
Juliet 64, come in. Over.

01:41:02.823 --> 01:41:04.723
Now, can you hold your weapon?

01:41:05.092 --> 01:41:06.081
Yes, sir.

01:41:06.326 --> 01:41:10.319
Anybody comes through that door gets
two in the chest and one in the head.

01:41:10.664 --> 01:41:14.100
You understand?
I'm still in the fight, sir.

01:41:14.368 --> 01:41:17.303
Captain Steele,
I need a medivac in here now!

01:41:17.504 --> 01:41:19.995
Corporal Smith has been hit!
Hold on, 25.

01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:21.773
Still in the fight.

01:41:21.842 --> 01:41:23.309
He's hurt pretty bad.

01:41:23.377 --> 01:41:27.108
25, we got wounded too. You'll have
to maintain your situation, over.

01:41:27.181 --> 01:41:29.741
If he doesn't get help in a half-hour,
he's in trouble!

01:41:30.517 --> 01:41:32.610
C-2, this is 64.

01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:37.052
Requesting a medivac for a critically
wounded at Chalk Four's location. Over.

01:41:37.124 --> 01:41:39.991
Command, Chalk Four
is requesting medivac.

01:41:40.194 --> 01:41:42.526
Can't risk it. It's still too hot.

01:41:42.996 --> 01:41:47.865
Captain, we cannot send in medivac
at this time. Sit tight. Over.

01:41:48.202 --> 01:41:52.036
25, this is 64. Negative on the medivac.
It's not possible.

01:41:52.239 --> 01:41:56.005
JOC cannot risk another bird.
You'll just have to hold on.

01:42:02.583 --> 01:42:04.016
All right. I got him.

01:42:04.084 --> 01:42:06.518
I want direct pressure on the wound.

01:42:08.388 --> 01:42:10.185
It's going to be all right.

01:42:49.263 --> 01:42:52.130
I think this is mine!

01:42:54.768 --> 01:42:57.896
This is Kilo 11.
I'm at the Durant crash site.

01:42:58.105 --> 01:42:59.504
Roger that.

01:43:21.094 --> 01:43:22.857
Crash site two secured.

01:43:23.096 --> 01:43:25.462
Lieutenant Colonel Cribbs for you, sir.

01:43:25.966 --> 01:43:26.830
Cribbs?

01:43:28.835 --> 01:43:31.133
They're still debating the route.
How long?

01:43:31.271 --> 01:43:32.898
At least a couple of hours.

01:43:33.073 --> 01:43:34.734
We haven't got that long, Joe.

01:43:34.808 --> 01:43:39.404
Pakistani General says, since we didn't
deign to inform him of the raid...

01:43:39.613 --> 01:43:43.447
It'll take some time to mobilize
the 10th Mountain and 100 vehicles.

01:43:43.517 --> 01:43:45.508
You tell the general this:

01:43:45.719 --> 01:43:48.620
I understand, but it is
my duty to remind him...

01:43:48.822 --> 01:43:52.883
That my men are surrounded by
thousands of armed Somali militia.

01:43:53.093 --> 01:43:58.360
It's imperative that we move them out of
the hostile area and into the safe zone.

01:43:58.565 --> 01:44:00.089
I need his help now.

01:44:01.101 --> 01:44:02.329
Yes, sir.

01:44:07.441 --> 01:44:08.669
Durant.

01:44:09.376 --> 01:44:11.844
Michael Durant.

01:44:12.579 --> 01:44:13.568
Yes.

01:44:14.047 --> 01:44:16.447
You are the Ranger who kills my people?

01:44:16.650 --> 01:44:20.051
I'm not a Ranger. I'm a pilot.

01:44:23.991 --> 01:44:25.288
That's right.

01:44:25.959 --> 01:44:28.951
None of you Americans smoke anymore.

01:44:32.165 --> 01:44:36.795
You all live long, dull, uninteresting lives.

01:44:38.672 --> 01:44:40.537
What do you want with me?

01:44:41.375 --> 01:44:43.104
You have taken hostages.

01:44:44.111 --> 01:44:45.703
We have you.

01:44:45.912 --> 01:44:49.006
My government will
never negotiate for me.

01:44:49.549 --> 01:44:54.111
Then perhaps you and
I can negotiate, huh?

01:44:55.589 --> 01:44:58.114
Soldier to soldier.

01:45:04.064 --> 01:45:05.861
I'm not in charge.

01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:13.573
Course not. You have the power to kill,
but not negotiate.

01:45:14.041 --> 01:45:16.942
In Somalia, killing is negotiation.

01:45:18.512 --> 01:45:21.879
Do you really think if
you get General Aidid...

01:45:22.082 --> 01:45:25.449
We will simply put down our weapons...

01:45:25.585 --> 01:45:28.577
And adopt American democracy?

01:45:29.022 --> 01:45:30.819
That the killing will stop?

01:45:31.224 --> 01:45:35.285
We know this:
Without victory, there can be no peace.

01:45:36.063 --> 01:45:38.497
There will always be killing, you see?

01:45:38.965 --> 01:45:41.160
This is how things are in our world.

01:45:54.014 --> 01:45:57.677
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:03.256
Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind.

01:46:05.992 --> 01:46:08.859
You got to take over from me.
Both hands.

01:46:16.570 --> 01:46:19.801
It's the femoral artery,
but I can't see it.

01:46:20.006 --> 01:46:23.464
Which means that it's
retracted up into the pelvis.

01:46:23.677 --> 01:46:27.977
I have to find it and clamp it.
It's the only way to stop the bleeding.

01:46:28.181 --> 01:46:30.274
I got no more IVs.

01:46:31.551 --> 01:46:34.452
So, I'm going to need
you to assist. Okay?

01:46:34.588 --> 01:46:36.215
Yeah, yeah.

01:46:37.157 --> 01:46:40.524
Now listen, Jamie.
I got to do something, it's going to hurt.

01:46:41.795 --> 01:46:45.492
I got to cause you more pain,
but I have to do it to help you.

01:46:45.699 --> 01:46:47.223
All right, you understand?

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:49.291
Morphine.
I can't.

01:46:49.503 --> 01:46:52.097
It'll lower your heart rate too far.
I'm sorry.

01:46:52.172 --> 01:46:54.470
Twombly, why don't you take his hands?

01:46:58.979 --> 01:47:01.914
Hold the wound open,
keep pressure on the top of the leg.

01:47:01.982 --> 01:47:04.177
Yurek, take the feet and a flashlight.

01:47:04.584 --> 01:47:05.710
On my count.

01:47:05.786 --> 01:47:07.777
All right, Jamie. All right.

01:47:10.056 --> 01:47:12.217
One. Two.

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:14.218
Three.

01:47:21.935 --> 01:47:24.369
Wait, wait. Okay. I feel it.

01:47:25.005 --> 01:47:26.370
I feel the pulse.

01:47:27.941 --> 01:47:29.272
I got it. I got it.

01:47:29.342 --> 01:47:30.934
I got it, yeah. I got it.

01:47:31.011 --> 01:47:32.603
I got it.
You got it?

01:47:33.046 --> 01:47:34.035
Clamp?

01:47:36.450 --> 01:47:37.815
I got it clamped.

01:47:37.951 --> 01:47:39.145
Hold it.
Got it.

01:47:39.219 --> 01:47:40.481
Here, grab it.

01:47:41.154 --> 01:47:42.883
It's tearing.
I got it.

01:47:43.123 --> 01:47:44.988
Doc, it's going back in!
Hold it!

01:47:45.058 --> 01:47:46.286
It's tearing!

01:47:46.626 --> 01:47:49.595
Okay. Get out. Hold the wound.
Okay, I'm holding.

01:47:50.831 --> 01:47:52.128
Move your hand.

01:48:03.343 --> 01:48:04.571
What?

01:48:23.697 --> 01:48:24.686
Fix it?

01:48:28.301 --> 01:48:30.735
Yeah, yeah. We got it.

01:48:46.386 --> 01:48:48.183
What the hell are you doing?

01:48:48.255 --> 01:48:52.658
It's all in the grind, Sarg'nt.
Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

01:48:52.859 --> 01:48:55.521
Grimesy, you are squared away.

01:49:11.845 --> 01:49:15.804
Sarg'nt, how would you
like a nice hot cup of Joe?

01:49:17.617 --> 01:49:19.209
Gold Coast blend.

01:49:19.419 --> 01:49:22.354
Sit down.
I want to take a look at that foot.

01:49:22.956 --> 01:49:25.049
No, it's not a problem.
Come on.

01:49:31.498 --> 01:49:34.592
Where the hell did they find you?
Behind a desk.

01:49:36.102 --> 01:49:39.128
No, really. What, you think I'm kidding?

01:49:42.809 --> 01:49:44.606
Is anybody hit?
We're good!

01:49:49.983 --> 01:49:51.143
You all right?

01:49:51.217 --> 01:49:52.206
Yeah!

01:49:52.419 --> 01:49:53.886
Is everybody all right?

01:49:53.954 --> 01:49:54.978
Yeah!

01:50:09.002 --> 01:50:10.196
Incoming!

01:50:23.383 --> 01:50:25.317
Keep firing... Faster!

01:51:15.769 --> 01:51:17.760
DiTomasso's hit! Pull him out!

01:51:51.237 --> 01:51:52.966
Ranger here. This is Kilo 11.

01:51:53.039 --> 01:51:56.270
Chalk Four. We're at the southeast
corner of the crash. Who's this?

01:51:56.342 --> 01:51:58.333
This is Hoot.
I'm coming with three friendlies.

01:51:58.411 --> 01:52:00.072
I need cover fire. Over.

01:52:00.146 --> 01:52:03.081
Roger, Kilo 11. Hold your fire!
Deltas coming in.

01:52:03.149 --> 01:52:05.174
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

01:52:09.889 --> 01:52:14.519
Ground personnel will have to mark
target positions with infrared strobes.

01:52:15.195 --> 01:52:18.961
Get little birds on strafing runs
and keep them going all night long.

01:52:19.065 --> 01:52:21.329
If we don't hold back this city...

01:52:22.035 --> 01:52:25.027
We'll have a 100 caskets
to fill by morning.

01:52:25.238 --> 01:52:26.466
Yes, sir.

01:52:26.673 --> 01:52:29.437
Colonel Harrell, ground
personnel at crash site one...

01:52:29.509 --> 01:52:34.003
Will have to mark the target with
infrared strobes to prep for air strike.

01:52:39.285 --> 01:52:40.513
McKnight.

01:52:44.591 --> 01:52:48.186
Between the 10th Mountain and UN,
we got enough personnel, okay?

01:52:49.529 --> 01:52:52.327
Danny, you guys do not
have to go back out again.

01:53:12.485 --> 01:53:15.045
I can't die here, man.

01:53:16.222 --> 01:53:20.318
You're not going to die, all right?
You're not going to die.

01:53:21.227 --> 01:53:22.694
I'm sorry.

01:53:22.896 --> 01:53:26.161
You don't have anything to be sorry for.

01:53:26.332 --> 01:53:29.495
You saved Twombly. You did perfect.

01:53:30.703 --> 01:53:32.170
You okay, Twombs?

01:53:32.739 --> 01:53:34.570
Yeah, I'm okay, Jamie.

01:53:35.909 --> 01:53:38.104
You did what you were trained to do.

01:53:39.045 --> 01:53:40.910
You should be proud of that.

01:53:44.017 --> 01:53:45.348
Be proud of that.

01:53:46.186 --> 01:53:48.051
Ev?
Yeah.

01:53:50.023 --> 01:53:51.354
Do me a favor.

01:53:54.427 --> 01:53:59.364
You tell my parents
that I fought well today.

01:54:06.806 --> 01:54:08.671
And that I fought hard.

01:54:10.643 --> 01:54:13.111
You're going to tell
them yourself, okay?

01:54:13.179 --> 01:54:14.510
Do you hear me?

01:54:16.316 --> 01:54:17.374
All right?

01:54:19.519 --> 01:54:22.647
Are the humvees here?
They're coming, Jamie.

01:54:23.156 --> 01:54:24.987
They're coming.

01:54:25.158 --> 01:54:27.422
You just got to hang
in there a little bit.

01:54:27.493 --> 01:54:29.984
You hold on for just a little bit.
I can.

01:54:30.163 --> 01:54:31.323
I can.

01:54:32.699 --> 01:54:34.166
It's nothing.

01:54:35.401 --> 01:54:36.834
It's nothing.

01:54:37.871 --> 01:54:38.997
It's nothing.

01:54:39.072 --> 01:54:41.404
It's nothing.
It's nothing.

01:54:42.342 --> 01:54:43.502
Nothing.

01:54:51.184 --> 01:54:52.173
Oh, shit.

01:54:53.186 --> 01:54:54.517
Hold the wound.

01:55:21.547 --> 01:55:22.844
Doc.

01:55:25.718 --> 01:55:26.742
Doc.

01:55:43.836 --> 01:55:45.167
It's okay.

01:56:11.798 --> 01:56:13.265
What are you doing?

01:56:16.636 --> 01:56:18.365
We need the ammo.

01:56:26.646 --> 01:56:28.443
You did all you could here.

01:56:28.982 --> 01:56:31.212
They should've sent a medivac.

01:56:31.718 --> 01:56:35.381
Right now we'd be out there
defending another crashed chopper.

01:56:35.655 --> 01:56:38.146
More men would get torn up.

01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:42.491
Maybe.

01:56:42.996 --> 01:56:45.863
See, you're thinking. Don't.

01:56:45.965 --> 01:56:48.991
Because, Sergeant, you can't
control who gets hit or who doesn't.

01:56:49.068 --> 01:56:51.832
Who falls out of a chopper or why.

01:56:52.038 --> 01:56:54.666
It ain't up to you. It's just war.

01:56:56.676 --> 01:56:58.667
Yeah, well, Smith's still dead.

01:57:00.346 --> 01:57:04.942
This all happened because Blackburn fell.
Should have, could have, don't matter.

01:57:05.118 --> 01:57:08.884
You'll get plenty of time to think
about all that later. Believe me.

01:57:12.658 --> 01:57:15.786
Sergeant, you got your men this far.

01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:18.324
You did it right today.

01:57:18.531 --> 01:57:21.989
You need to start thinking about
getting these men out of here.

01:57:28.408 --> 01:57:30.308
Well, shall we?

01:57:39.052 --> 01:57:42.146
I need four guys in this corner now!

01:57:48.327 --> 01:57:49.919
RPG!

01:57:53.833 --> 01:57:56.324
This is Barber 52 in
position for gun run.

01:57:56.402 --> 01:57:58.529
Jesus Christ. Look at that.

01:57:59.238 --> 01:58:02.264
This is 25! I can see you.
You're right above me.

01:58:02.442 --> 01:58:05.878
Eversmann, I can't tell who's
who down there. Too much activity.

01:58:05.945 --> 01:58:08.436
I'll mark the target with a strobe! Over.

01:58:08.681 --> 01:58:09.841
Roger that.

01:58:21.627 --> 01:58:22.787
You see it?

01:58:25.131 --> 01:58:26.723
Nah, I can't see shit.

01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:30.567
I'm putting it on the roof.
You're going to need help!

01:58:30.636 --> 01:58:31.625
Cover me.

01:58:32.839 --> 01:58:36.605
Okay, guys, we're going to lay down
some cover fire for him on three!

01:58:36.809 --> 01:58:37.798
Ready?

01:58:37.977 --> 01:58:38.966
One.

01:58:39.045 --> 01:58:40.137
Two.

01:58:40.313 --> 01:58:42.042
Three. Go!

01:59:14.614 --> 01:59:18.050
I got your position. I got the target.
We're inbound and hot.

01:59:42.642 --> 01:59:47.306
C-2, miniguns dry. Request permission
to return to base. Rearm. Over.

01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:50.313
Roger that. Second team inbound.
Your station.

01:59:50.483 --> 01:59:52.678
On your location, four minutes.

02:00:00.826 --> 02:00:03.886
All right, they're here.
Get the wounded ready to move.

02:00:04.363 --> 02:00:06.797
Lay down some cover fire!

02:00:09.135 --> 02:00:11.228
I thought I heard a noise out here!

02:00:11.304 --> 02:00:14.034
Load up. We're getting out of here.
Yes, sir.

02:00:17.210 --> 02:00:21.943
25, this is 64. The rescue column's here
and will be with you in about 5 minutes.

02:00:22.148 --> 02:00:23.877
Prepare your men for exfil.

02:00:23.950 --> 02:00:26.441
Yeah, roger that, sir! Roger that!

02:00:27.186 --> 02:00:30.952
Five minutes! The convoy is
going to be here in five minutes!

02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:53.174
I need a mag! Eversmann, I'm out!

02:00:53.346 --> 02:00:54.677
My last one!

02:01:04.857 --> 02:01:07.018
The convoy is here!

02:01:25.578 --> 02:01:29.105
Sergeant Eversmann.
I heard you guys needed a lift!

02:01:29.348 --> 02:01:31.009
Yes, sir!

02:01:31.217 --> 02:01:33.811
Bring your wounded and
start loading them up!

02:01:41.027 --> 02:01:43.154
Hey, I got you. I got you.

02:01:43.362 --> 02:01:46.092
It's okay. I want to walk.

02:01:46.632 --> 02:01:49.692
Yeah, I would too. Let's go!

02:01:58.878 --> 02:01:59.970
Move!

02:02:03.249 --> 02:02:06.582
We get the pilots' bodies out,
and then we go to the stadium.

02:02:07.253 --> 02:02:09.050
We're running out of room around here.

02:02:09.121 --> 02:02:11.089
Cram into every possible space.

02:02:11.924 --> 02:02:16.918
Okay, 10th Mountain provides security
for armor, walks us out of the hot zone.

02:02:17.129 --> 02:02:18.619
10th Mountain? No.

02:02:18.831 --> 02:02:21.925
Sir, with respect, my Rangers
can provide rear security.

02:02:22.101 --> 02:02:26.265
We'll walk you out of the hot zone,
then we'll jump on the last few vehicles.

02:02:27.273 --> 02:02:28.535
Okay, let's get out of here.

02:02:28.607 --> 02:02:29.801
Let's go.

02:02:30.009 --> 02:02:32.500
All right, you got him?
Yeah, come on.

02:02:34.447 --> 02:02:35.812
Come on!

02:02:36.949 --> 02:02:39.941
These things are fucking bullet magnets.
Come on, let's go!

02:02:40.019 --> 02:02:42.453
We go when I'm ordered to, soldier.

02:02:45.324 --> 02:02:46.518
Careful.

02:02:47.126 --> 02:02:49.321
Easy. Go easy.

02:02:52.732 --> 02:02:54.097
Easy.

02:03:04.610 --> 02:03:06.840
Colonel, what is going on down there?

02:03:06.912 --> 02:03:10.109
They're dismantling the
entire cockpit around the body.

02:03:10.316 --> 02:03:13.979
How long is it going to take?
I need an honest, no-shit assessment.

02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:16.285
They can't say!

02:03:18.257 --> 02:03:19.485
Danny...

02:03:20.993 --> 02:03:22.790
No one gets left behind.

02:03:23.496 --> 02:03:25.327
You understand me, son?

02:03:25.798 --> 02:03:27.265
Yes, General.

02:03:27.933 --> 02:03:29.560
Do what you have to do.

02:03:30.936 --> 02:03:32.198
Roger.

02:03:38.844 --> 02:03:41.074
Come on. Bring him through.
I got him.

02:03:41.947 --> 02:03:45.110
Get all his gear. Get the wounded out.
Got you, sir!

02:03:50.723 --> 02:03:52.122
Move!
Got you!

02:03:52.792 --> 02:03:54.817
Move out! Move out! Let's go!

02:04:04.904 --> 02:04:05.893
Fuck!

02:04:08.741 --> 02:04:10.072
Fire in the hole!

02:04:10.276 --> 02:04:12.107
Let's go! Move!
Let's go!

02:04:22.655 --> 02:04:26.056
Open the hatch! We got men back here!
No room here! Go on the roof!

02:04:26.125 --> 02:04:27.217
What's going on?

02:04:27.293 --> 02:04:30.285
The roof?
I'm not getting on no fucking roof!

02:04:31.263 --> 02:04:32.662
No, no, it's full.

02:04:34.099 --> 02:04:37.364
We're running out. Keep moving.
Use the vehicles as cover.

02:04:39.772 --> 02:04:41.831
Move it! Let's go!

02:04:58.757 --> 02:05:01.282
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

02:05:03.295 --> 02:05:04.660
Move!
Go! Move!

02:05:04.897 --> 02:05:06.262
Go!

02:06:00.853 --> 02:06:03.287
Get down! Get down!

02:06:04.523 --> 02:06:05.785
Get down, lady!

02:06:08.294 --> 02:06:09.659
I'm out of ammo!

02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:13.021
Sanderson, I'm out of ammo!

02:06:18.037 --> 02:06:19.629
Don't you do it.

02:06:20.239 --> 02:06:22.730
What are you doing?
Don't you damn do it.

02:06:24.543 --> 02:06:25.908
Kurth, let's go!

02:08:49.755 --> 02:08:51.245
Easy.

02:09:41.140 --> 02:09:42.903
Ah, shit.

02:09:42.975 --> 02:09:46.638
Bullet missed your jugular by
about three millimeters. Don't move.

02:09:48.313 --> 02:09:50.338
Hurry up, hurry up.

02:09:53.719 --> 02:09:57.712
Little short on coffee,
but I got you some tea.

02:10:01.994 --> 02:10:03.621
How you doing, soldier?

02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:06.695
Can't feel a thing.

02:10:16.775 --> 02:10:18.367
Take his pulse.

02:10:51.710 --> 02:10:53.109
Hey, Sarg'nt.

02:10:57.683 --> 02:10:58.672
Captain.

02:10:58.851 --> 02:11:01.843
Lorenzo. How you doing?

02:11:04.456 --> 02:11:09.291
It went in and out, so the medic said
I should be okay in a couple of days.

02:11:09.461 --> 02:11:11.156
That's great news.

02:11:11.763 --> 02:11:13.458
Are we going after them?

02:11:13.565 --> 02:11:16.295
You bet your ass we will.
We got to regroup.

02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:19.804
Don't go out there without me.

02:11:20.806 --> 02:11:24.298
Don't go back out there without me.

02:11:25.043 --> 02:11:26.943
I can still do my job.

02:11:28.714 --> 02:11:31.342
You get some rest now, okay?

02:11:46.498 --> 02:11:47.897
You're going back in?

02:11:50.002 --> 02:11:51.833
There are still men out there.

02:11:54.239 --> 02:11:55.797
Goddamn.

02:12:00.979 --> 02:12:02.276
When I go home...

02:12:03.282 --> 02:12:04.772
And people ask me:

02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:08.283
"Hey, Hoot, why do you do it, man?

02:12:08.854 --> 02:12:12.688
"Why? You some kind of war junkie?"

02:12:13.492 --> 02:12:15.926
I won't say a goddamn word.

02:12:16.261 --> 02:12:17.489
Why?

02:12:18.130 --> 02:12:19.961
They won't understand.

02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:23.998
They won't understand why we do it.

02:12:25.504 --> 02:12:29.634
They won't understand it's
about the men next to you.

02:12:31.476 --> 02:12:32.807
And that's it.

02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:36.311
That's all it is.

02:12:46.658 --> 02:12:51.027
Don't even think about it, all right?
I'm better on my own.

02:12:56.168 --> 02:12:59.160
We started a whole new week.
It's Monday.

02:13:12.017 --> 02:13:14.178
I was talking to
Blackburn the other day...

02:13:14.252 --> 02:13:18.951
And he asked me, "What changed?
Why are we going home?"

02:13:20.492 --> 02:13:22.824
And I said, "Nothing. "

02:13:23.028 --> 02:13:26.964
But that's not true, you know.
I think everything's changed.

02:13:28.367 --> 02:13:29.857
I know I've changed.

02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:38.336
A friend of mine asked
me before I got here....

02:13:38.477 --> 02:13:40.741
It was when we were all shipping out.

02:13:40.879 --> 02:13:42.369
He asked me:

02:13:43.648 --> 02:13:46.378
"Why are you going to
fight somebody else's war?

02:13:47.085 --> 02:13:49.519
"What, do y'all think you're heroes?"

02:13:52.491 --> 02:13:54.891
I didn't know what to say at the time...

02:13:57.829 --> 02:14:00.229
But if he asked me again, I'd say no.

02:14:02.801 --> 02:14:04.826
I'd say there's no way in hell.

02:14:05.937 --> 02:14:07.962
Nobody asks to be a hero.

02:14:13.311 --> 02:14:15.575
It just sometimes turns out that way.

02:14:19.551 --> 02:14:22.611
I'll talk to your ma and
pa when I get home, okay?

02:15:06.198 --> 02:15:09.895
My love, you are strong and
you will do well in life.

02:15:10.936 --> 02:15:13.404
I love you and my children deeply.

02:15:14.306 --> 02:15:17.798
Today and tomorrow,
let each day grow and grow.

02:15:19.010 --> 02:15:23.174
Keep smiling and never give up,
even when things get you down.

02:15:24.483 --> 02:15:26.917
So, in closing, my love...

02:15:27.285 --> 02:15:31.119
Tonight, tuck my children in bed warmly.

02:15:31.556 --> 02:15:36.152
Tell them I love them.
Then hug them for me...

02:15:36.361 --> 02:15:39.194
And give them both a
kiss good night for Daddy.
