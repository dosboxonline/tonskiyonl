00:34.493 --> 00:35.953
Howdy, boys.

00:35.995 --> 00:37.788
Oh, sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.665
(quietly):
How are you guys doing? Good?

00:39.707 --> 00:43.210
Why don't you, uh, go have
a smoke or something, okay?

00:43.252 --> 00:44.211
I got this.

00:44.253 --> 00:48.507
Oh, and, uh, you guys...

00:48.549 --> 00:51.469
you are the real heroes.

00:52.970 --> 00:55.931
(indistinct chatter)

01:02.605 --> 01:04.607
("Rock el Casbah"
by Rachid Taha playing)

01:09.695 --> 01:12.072
Gentlemen.

01:12.990 --> 01:14.241
(grunts)

01:15.701 --> 01:17.328
Oh!

01:17.369 --> 01:19.371
(man singing in Arabic)

01:19.413 --> 01:21.248

01:21.290 --> 01:23.584

-(screams)
-(crunching)

02:07.545 --> 02:10.464
(crunches loudly)

02:21.308 --> 02:23.519
All clear, boys.

02:23.561 --> 02:24.728
Mission accomplished.

02:24.770 --> 02:28.023
(man panting)

02:28.065 --> 02:29.900
(yells)

02:31.652 --> 02:33.612
God bless America.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.114
Captain.

02:35.155 --> 02:38.617
I found this.

02:40.703 --> 02:43.080
The Islamic State is not exactly

02:43.122 --> 02:47.543
a hotbed
of scientific expertise.

02:47.585 --> 02:49.670
But they've counterfeited

02:49.712 --> 02:52.631
this Compound V shit of yours?

02:52.673 --> 02:56.468
It seems that way,
Mr. Secretary.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.971
How did they get the formula?

02:59.013 --> 03:01.515
Honestly, we have no idea.

03:01.557 --> 03:05.144
Well, you must have some idea.

03:05.185 --> 03:08.564
Some tourist shoplift it
from your lab?

03:08.606 --> 03:11.108
Or maybe an inside job?

03:11.150 --> 03:14.069
Sir, we would like to get
to the bottom of this

03:14.111 --> 03:15.446
as much as you would.

03:15.487 --> 03:16.739
Ms. Stillwell,

03:16.780 --> 03:19.825
if I had my way,
the Justice Department

03:19.867 --> 03:22.036
would haul your smug,
tennis-toned ass

03:22.077 --> 03:25.456
into Congress
and make you testify

03:25.497 --> 03:27.458
to corporate fraud.

03:27.499 --> 03:31.795
What is Lockheed Martin's
number one product?

03:31.837 --> 03:32.796
Sorry?

03:32.838 --> 03:34.590
Its top seller.

03:34.632 --> 03:35.966
You should know this,

03:36.008 --> 03:38.177
you served
on their board of directors.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.220
-The Patriot missile.
-Correct.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.597
Northrop?

03:41.639 --> 03:43.015
B-2 Stealth.

03:43.057 --> 03:44.642
General Dynamics?

03:44.683 --> 03:47.853
Tomahawk and the M1 Abrams.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.940
Billions of dollars
of bleeding-edge hardware.

03:50.981 --> 03:55.235
Do you know what all of that
is as of today?

03:55.277 --> 03:58.322
A worthless pile of shit.

03:58.364 --> 04:01.867
Because Naqib and other
super terrorists like him

04:01.909 --> 04:04.411
can flick away that junk
like flicking a flea.

04:04.453 --> 04:08.123
So it doesn't matter
where heroes really come from.

04:08.165 --> 04:10.125
Frankly, it doesn't even matter

04:10.167 --> 04:12.461
how the enemy got
the Compound V.

04:12.503 --> 04:15.172
What matters is they've got it.

04:15.214 --> 04:18.634
It is a whole new world now.

04:18.676 --> 04:20.803
And there is only one company

04:20.844 --> 04:24.640
that has the product
to fight back.

04:28.394 --> 04:30.396
My company.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.398
My product.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.942
SUSAN:
What can I say?

04:34.984 --> 04:37.820
The Pentagon's agreed to keep
Compound V classified.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.446
Classified?

04:39.488 --> 04:41.115
What the fuck are you on about?

04:41.156 --> 04:43.826
Because of the Naqib asshole
that is out there,

04:43.867 --> 04:46.120
we have to keep Vought
happy now.

04:46.161 --> 04:48.998
Vought are the ones that fucking
created the cunt.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.583
-We have no solid proof on that.
-No hard proof?

04:51.625 --> 04:54.003
I fucking well rescued
the proof from a basement.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.880
She's sitting on a bloody bog
as we speak.

04:56.922 --> 04:58.465
Listen. Listen.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.467
Vought's manufacturing
super villains.

05:00.509 --> 05:01.760
It's the story of the century.

05:01.802 --> 05:05.097
Don't you want
a fucking Pulitzer?

05:05.139 --> 05:07.057
Well, fuck you, too, then.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.854
(Butcher speaking indistinctly)

05:20.029 --> 05:22.656
(chuckles)
Susan, come on.

05:22.698 --> 05:26.035
There must be something
we can do here, yeah?

05:26.076 --> 05:29.121
Look, the military deal
is signed and sealed.

05:29.163 --> 05:31.957
Do you think one mute girl
is going to derail that?

05:31.999 --> 05:33.542
Especially coming
from the fugitives

05:33.584 --> 05:36.503
-that killed Translucent?
-Fugitives?

05:36.545 --> 05:40.507
Vought insisted and...
and the DOJ agreed.

05:40.549 --> 05:42.176
You're wanted men now.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.136
-(knocking on door)
-Hello?

05:44.178 --> 05:45.429
This isn't a day spa.

05:45.471 --> 05:47.264
Other people got
to use the facilities.

06:11.163 --> 06:13.457
Look, I gave you the V.

06:13.499 --> 06:15.834
I gave you everything
you asked for and more.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.711
I trusted you, and this is
the fucking thanks I get.

06:17.753 --> 06:20.714
Butcher, I will still protect
your families.

06:20.756 --> 06:23.092
Yeah, and keep
your bleeding career even safer.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.177
Well, what about me
and the Boys, then, eh?

06:25.219 --> 06:27.638
You cut bait and run
for your lives.

06:27.679 --> 06:30.224
I'm sorry.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.435
(click over phone)

06:33.477 --> 06:35.270
Yeah, mm-hmm.

06:35.312 --> 06:36.438
Right.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.982
All right, then, love.

06:39.024 --> 06:42.236
Well, that's all under control,
isn't it?

06:42.277 --> 06:45.072
-Oh. We need to split up.
-Mm-hmm.

06:45.114 --> 06:46.698
Oi, what the fuck are you doing?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.117
We ain't, we ain't done yet.

06:48.158 --> 06:49.785
The hell we ain't.

06:49.827 --> 06:51.286
We got Vought, the Supes,
and the Feds on our asses.

06:51.328 --> 06:52.538
I'm going to Montreal.

06:52.579 --> 06:53.747
MOTHER'S MILK:
Yeah, and how you gonna get

06:53.789 --> 06:54.790
your crazy-ass girlfriend
over the border?

06:54.832 --> 06:55.791
She has a name.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.042
(speaks French)

06:57.084 --> 06:58.794
It's Kimiko. Okay?

06:58.836 --> 07:00.254
-Kimiko.
-Oi, listen.

07:00.295 --> 07:01.713
Shut your fucking traps.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.091
We're on the verge of nailing
these cunts.

07:04.133 --> 07:05.759
And you want to cut bait and run

07:05.801 --> 07:07.678
before we've played
our final card.

07:07.719 --> 07:10.180
Okay, what is it, man?

07:10.222 --> 07:13.475
Give us a couple hours. Yeah?

07:13.517 --> 07:14.560
Hughie, you're with me.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.813
Come on, son.

07:17.855 --> 07:19.857
Chop, chop.

07:35.747 --> 07:38.167
Oh! Annie.
(exhales)

07:38.208 --> 07:39.668
You scared me.

07:39.710 --> 07:41.753
You didn't say you were coming.

07:44.298 --> 07:47.551
I hid this under my floorboards
right after Daddy left.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.888
I thought that maybe

07:50.929 --> 07:53.140
he would come back
for it, but...

07:54.558 --> 07:56.852
-Still smells like him.
-It was a bad habit.

07:56.894 --> 07:59.521
His father smoked a pipe,
so, you know...

07:59.563 --> 08:02.441
What's Compound V?

08:02.482 --> 08:04.026
Uh, Compound V?

08:04.067 --> 08:05.444
I don't know, sweetheart.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.486
Should I?

08:11.992 --> 08:14.620
How old was I?
Hmm?

08:16.246 --> 08:20.918
How old was I when you let
Vought pump me full of drugs?

08:20.959 --> 08:23.170
-Annie, honestly, I don't know
what you're talk...
-How old,

08:23.212 --> 08:25.464
when you let them turn me
into a freak?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.257
You're not a freak.

08:27.299 --> 08:28.550
Never say that.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.513
So it's true.

08:40.562 --> 08:41.980
Annie...

08:42.022 --> 08:45.817
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.322
(breathing heavily)

08:50.364 --> 08:53.825
-Did, did Vought
tell you all this?
-No.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.578
No. A friend told me.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.668
How much did they pay you?

09:02.709 --> 09:06.338
-It wasn't about money.
-How much?

09:06.380 --> 09:07.339
There was no money.

09:07.381 --> 09:08.966
They, they, they just paid

09:09.007 --> 09:11.551
for the medical bills,
that's it.

09:11.593 --> 09:14.054
I did it because they,
they promised

09:14.096 --> 09:17.599
that you'd have a chance
at an extraordinary life.

09:17.641 --> 09:20.936
To be strong and successful
and special.

09:20.978 --> 09:22.813
I mean, who wouldn't
want that for their...

09:22.854 --> 09:25.732
You made me think that I was
chosen by God.

09:25.774 --> 09:26.942
You were!

09:26.984 --> 09:28.360
God brought Vought
into our lives.

09:28.402 --> 09:29.611
He made this possible.

09:29.653 --> 09:31.571
Bullshit!

09:31.613 --> 09:33.198
You did!

09:33.240 --> 09:37.661
And then you controlled
every single minute of it.

09:37.703 --> 09:39.871
You woke me up at 5:00 a.m.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.249
to train
for those stupid pageants,

09:42.291 --> 09:45.961
and the tap dancing
and the tae kwon do.

09:46.003 --> 09:48.171
I gave up every moment
of my life.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.673
I-I-- and I was happy to do it.

09:49.715 --> 09:50.674
This was our dream.

09:50.716 --> 09:52.092
This was your dream!

09:52.134 --> 09:56.722
I never got a chance
to choose my own dreams.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.266
No wonder I don't know who
the fuck I'm supposed to be!

09:59.308 --> 10:00.851
Annie.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.485
Was it really bad investments?

10:10.527 --> 10:12.446
-What?
-You told me that Daddy left

10:12.487 --> 10:14.990
because he lost
all of our savings.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.621
He agreed to all of it.

10:21.663 --> 10:26.084
And then, one day,
he... he didn't,

10:26.126 --> 10:28.128
so he walked out on us.

10:32.883 --> 10:35.344
Maybe he didn't want
to lie to me.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.471
So I'm the monster?

10:37.512 --> 10:39.306
You have a good life.

10:39.348 --> 10:43.060
-(sighs)
-People would give anything
to be what you are.

10:43.101 --> 10:46.104
I thought I did what was right.

10:48.357 --> 10:50.317
Annie, Annie.

10:50.359 --> 10:53.570
Annie! Annie!

10:53.612 --> 10:56.073
DEEP:
It's time to knock back some
of this per diem, buddy.

10:56.114 --> 10:58.700
(chuckles):
Oh, it's a pretty fancy bottle.

10:58.742 --> 11:02.496
(chuckles) What are we, uh,
what are we celebrating?

11:02.537 --> 11:04.331
What are you talking about?
The Seven getting called up.

11:04.373 --> 11:05.540
Yeah.

11:08.085 --> 11:10.212
You know the whole reason
the Navy discontinued

11:10.253 --> 11:13.507
their Sea Mammal
mine clearance program?

11:13.548 --> 11:14.966
It's because it cost
way too much

11:15.008 --> 11:17.094
to train the fucking dolphins.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.678
Yeah.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.347
But with me on board,

11:20.389 --> 11:22.891
it's like a, it's like
a pick-up game of basketball.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.601
(sighs)

11:24.643 --> 11:27.687
I've always wanted to lead
my own unit, Jeff.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.147
It's like a dream
come true for me.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.525
(blender running)

11:33.485 --> 11:34.444
(blender stops)

11:34.486 --> 11:35.737
(sniffs)

11:35.779 --> 11:38.115
Smells like a comeback.
(chuckles)

11:39.157 --> 11:40.867
-Anyways...
-Hmm.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.661
-Cheers, buddy.
-(chuckles)

11:42.702 --> 11:45.205
So, when?

11:45.247 --> 11:47.165
When, what?

11:47.207 --> 11:49.000
When do I ship out?

11:49.042 --> 11:50.919
Oh. (chuckles)

11:50.961 --> 11:52.671
Gosh.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.507
You know that water park's
opening up a new splash zone,

11:55.549 --> 11:56.925
and, and they are real excited

11:56.967 --> 11:58.468
to have you cut that ribbon.
(chuckles)

11:58.510 --> 11:59.886
(laughing)

12:01.346 --> 12:03.432
You know, I'm seriously
leaving, Jeff.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.100
Fuck Ohio.

12:07.394 --> 12:10.063
Here's the sitch.

12:10.105 --> 12:12.023
I-I talked to New York.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.985
And... you're not.

12:15.026 --> 12:16.695
So much.

12:16.736 --> 12:17.737
Leaving.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.907
What?

12:20.949 --> 12:24.494
They didn't share details.

12:24.536 --> 12:27.456
(chuckles):
But hey, look...

12:27.497 --> 12:31.793
the boys in marketing have
created a primo tag for you:

12:31.835 --> 12:34.504
The Savior of Sandusky!

12:34.546 --> 12:36.006
(laughs)

12:36.047 --> 12:38.425
That has a nice ring,
doesn't it?

12:44.848 --> 12:46.183
(door creaks)

12:52.355 --> 12:54.774
(birds chirping)

13:13.126 --> 13:14.669
William.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.258
What are you looking at
out there?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.885
Eastern meadowlarks.

13:21.927 --> 13:26.181
It was either bird-watching
or alcoholism, so...

13:26.223 --> 13:27.933
birds.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.392
I thought we agreed that you

13:29.434 --> 13:31.770
were never going
to come out here.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.606
Yeah, well,
you taught me a thing or two

13:34.648 --> 13:37.609
about broken promises.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.778
Didn't you?

13:41.112 --> 13:43.114
This is Hugh Campbell.

13:44.407 --> 13:46.826
We're working
with M.M. and Frenchie.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.912
I got the Boys back together.

13:48.954 --> 13:50.288
Grace Mallory.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.749
I'm the founder
of your little club.

13:52.791 --> 13:55.835
-You're, uh...
-So, let me hear it.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.507
I need your help.

14:00.549 --> 14:02.175
Sorry, I can't.

14:02.217 --> 14:05.637
I'm hoping to photograph
a snowy owl in the dunes.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.432
Look...

14:09.474 --> 14:12.227
I didn't want to come here,

14:12.269 --> 14:14.813
but I need your help.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.649
And you're going to
fucking help.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.484
Why's that?

14:26.324 --> 14:29.202
Because you owe me.

14:29.244 --> 14:31.705
You fucking owe me, goddamn it.

14:32.747 --> 14:35.125
(faucet dripping)

14:40.630 --> 14:42.882
(blows)

15:01.735 --> 15:03.737
(gasps)

15:17.917 --> 15:19.377
(sniffs)

15:20.337 --> 15:22.631
(thump in distance)

15:28.553 --> 15:29.596
Look at you, mon coeur.

15:31.806 --> 15:33.683
Run! Run!

15:36.561 --> 15:38.938
(banging on door)

15:40.565 --> 15:43.610
(grunting)

15:45.195 --> 15:47.030
(man yelling in pain)

15:48.823 --> 15:49.908
(weapon hisses)

15:49.949 --> 15:51.826
(man yells, groans in pain)

15:53.912 --> 15:56.122
(man's groaning distorting)

15:57.165 --> 15:58.792
(distorted radio chatter)

16:01.836 --> 16:03.797
MAN:
Who's got eyes on her?

16:03.838 --> 16:06.341
MAN 2 (in distance):
Over here!

16:06.383 --> 16:07.592
(indistinct shouts)

16:12.097 --> 16:13.598
(panting)

16:13.640 --> 16:16.393
MAN:
Good job.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.978
We won't let her get away.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.939
(indistinct shout in distance)

16:22.190 --> 16:23.274
(over radio):
This is Alpha Team.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.652
Suspect is in custody.

16:25.694 --> 16:28.154
MALLORY:
There's simply nothing else
to say. I can't help you.

16:28.196 --> 16:29.781
Well, you're gonna have to do
better than that.

16:29.823 --> 16:33.159
-Do I? Why?
-'Cause you made me a promise.

16:33.201 --> 16:35.036
But then my grandchildren
got incinerated.

16:35.078 --> 16:37.622
Tends to change
one's perspective.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.124
There weren't even teeth left,

16:39.165 --> 16:42.085
Lamplighter had burnt them alive
so thoroughly.

16:44.129 --> 16:46.256
Well,

16:46.297 --> 16:50.218
I think I've had
enough sun for one day.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.429
Pleasure meeting you, Hugh.

16:52.470 --> 16:53.888
Butcher.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.684
Well, what about
what you've done?

16:57.726 --> 16:59.144
What I've done?

17:00.186 --> 17:02.021
To who?

17:04.274 --> 17:07.861
To me, goddamn it. To me.

17:07.902 --> 17:09.863
You trained me up,
manipulated me,

17:09.904 --> 17:12.323
aimed me at Homelander
like a fucking howitzer.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.910
And then when it didn't suit you
anymore, you just threw me away.

17:15.952 --> 17:18.371
And not a day goes by
I don't regret it.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.582
Day late, dollar short, love.

17:22.250 --> 17:26.379
Now, I'm going to finish
what you started,

17:26.421 --> 17:28.423
and I need your help.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.053
Please.

17:40.351 --> 17:43.229
You can leave with something,

17:43.271 --> 17:45.523
if you never come back

17:45.565 --> 17:48.193
and you keep your
goddamn promise this time.

17:52.197 --> 17:53.698
Madelyn Stillwell.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.492
Vought's VP?

17:55.533 --> 17:57.118
-Homelander's her main account.
-Yeah, that ain't news.

17:57.160 --> 18:00.121
(chuckles)
No, but this is:

18:00.163 --> 18:02.415
They have a--
what shall we say?--

18:02.457 --> 18:04.876
a very special relationship.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.504
Complicated, intimate,
hard to quantify.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.047
And you know this how?

18:09.088 --> 18:11.466
Still have a few fingers
in a few pies.

18:11.508 --> 18:13.635
I don't know
if Homelander has a weakness,

18:13.676 --> 18:16.805
but if he does, she'll know it.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.396
Good-bye, Grace.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.066
You want to kill yourself,
that's your right--

18:28.107 --> 18:32.737
I won't stop you--
but, Billy, not the others.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.951
Vengeance isn't a path
to glory, Hugh.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.829
It's a one-way ticket
to a dead end,

18:40.870 --> 18:44.249
looking at fucking birds.

18:52.090 --> 18:55.051
Oh... No, go ahead.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.970
Sure.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.564
(sniffles)

19:14.153 --> 19:16.155
(sighs)

19:24.998 --> 19:27.792
(quietly):
Dude. Dude, it's A-Train.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.043
Really?

19:30.920 --> 19:32.922
It's fucking A-Train.

19:34.966 --> 19:36.634
Can I help you?

19:36.676 --> 19:38.219
I'm just keeping an eye out.

19:39.387 --> 19:41.514
(chuckles)
That's funny, um,

19:41.556 --> 19:45.268
it really looks like you're
only keeping an eye on me.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.395
You know I'm A-Train, right?

19:47.437 --> 19:50.690
Yeah, and I'm Homelander.

19:50.732 --> 19:52.567
Dude, whip back to A-Train.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.487
Oh.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.740
Listen, I'm sorry about that.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.158
We're good.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.785
(chuckles):
Oh. Wait, so now that you...

20:02.827 --> 20:05.496
now you know I'm A-Train,
now we're good?

20:05.538 --> 20:08.833
Listen, man, I'm sorry.
It was my mistake.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.878
Yeah, you're damn right
it's your mistake.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.296
I'm A-Train.

20:13.338 --> 20:16.049
I'm the fastest
fucking man alive!

20:16.090 --> 20:18.426
(indistinct chatter)

20:18.468 --> 20:21.846
What are you all
fucking looking at?

20:28.311 --> 20:30.563
-You missed it.
-Eyes front.

20:30.605 --> 20:32.607
Eyes fucking front, Hughie.

20:32.649 --> 20:34.609
-Boys are gone.
-What?

20:34.651 --> 20:36.194
Someone's grabbed them.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.196
Oh, yeah? How do you know that?

20:38.237 --> 20:40.114
The window's new,
the front path is scrubbed,

20:40.156 --> 20:42.158
and there's a black van
with "Flowers" on it,

20:42.200 --> 20:44.118
probably full of cunts
waiting to jump us.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.537
-Vought?
-Nah, someone else doing

20:46.579 --> 20:47.830
their dirty work for them,

20:47.872 --> 20:50.291
probably some
Fed black ops unit.

20:56.089 --> 20:58.466
Okay. Okay, what are we...
what-what are we gonna do?

20:58.508 --> 21:00.301
How are we gonna get
the guys back?

21:00.343 --> 21:02.720
BUTCHER:
We're on our own.
We've got to get to Stillwell

21:02.762 --> 21:05.223
-before the walls close in.
-Who gives a fuck
about Stillwell?

21:05.264 --> 21:07.100
-We have to go back for them.
-You don't get it, Hughie.

21:07.141 --> 21:09.185
We got about a couple hours
before they find us,

21:09.227 --> 21:10.520
and that's if we're lucky.

21:10.561 --> 21:13.231
We got to hit back
and hit back now.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.732
You're abandoning them.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.819
I mean, they all...
they risked their...

21:17.860 --> 21:19.862
Mother's Milk has a daughter.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.114
They'd want us
to finish the job.

21:21.155 --> 21:23.366
Your job.

21:23.408 --> 21:26.911
Your job, not theirs.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.330
It's all about Homelander,
isn't it?

21:29.372 --> 21:32.625
And A-Train. This is your
fucking shit, too, Hughie.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.627
I promised you payback,
didn't I?

21:36.045 --> 21:38.339
Mallory give you the same speech
back in the day?

21:38.381 --> 21:39.716
Yeah. Yeah, she did.

21:39.757 --> 21:42.093
But she broke her promise.

21:42.135 --> 21:43.720
I'm keeping mine.

21:45.888 --> 21:47.974
I'm so fucking stupid.

21:50.184 --> 21:51.686
You never cared about me.

21:51.728 --> 21:54.063
Or Robin, did you?

21:54.105 --> 21:56.899
I was just useful to you.

21:56.941 --> 21:59.318
Fuck, Hughie.
Of course you're useful.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.738
I mean, that's why you're here,
isn't it?

22:01.779 --> 22:06.284
Now we just got to take
one more step.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.286
Yeah?

22:08.327 --> 22:10.288
Come on.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.248
HUGHIE:
No.

22:12.290 --> 22:14.834
We have to save them.

22:14.876 --> 22:17.003
For fuck's sakes, Hughie,
we don't have time

22:17.045 --> 22:19.005
for this shit right now, okay?

22:19.047 --> 22:21.841
We get Stillwell.
Now, get in the fucking car.

22:21.883 --> 22:23.843
Then what?

22:23.885 --> 22:26.220
Becca comes back from the dead?
Robin, too?

22:26.262 --> 22:29.098
This is never gonna stop--
it's just gonna be more blood

22:29.140 --> 22:31.350
and... awfulness.

22:33.227 --> 22:35.188
That's the fucking game.

22:35.229 --> 22:38.608
If you don't like to play, why
did you join the fucking team?

22:40.401 --> 22:42.862
Mallory's right-- you're just
gonna drag us all down with you.

22:44.113 --> 22:46.365
Not me.

22:46.407 --> 22:48.242
Not anymore.

22:51.162 --> 22:53.956
You're a fucking pathetic cunt

22:53.998 --> 22:56.584
and an insult to Robin's memory.

22:57.835 --> 23:00.129
I think I'm doing this for her.

23:04.842 --> 23:06.844
Good-bye, Hughie.

I remember you telling me
you like to come here to listen

to the choir rehearse,

25:21.812 --> 25:23.522
You've got a lot of balls.

25:23.564 --> 25:25.900
Just two.

to arrest you.

Actually, uh...

25:34.116 --> 25:38.788
Annie... I need your help.

25:47.797 --> 25:49.131
-Please just listen to me.
-Why?

25:49.173 --> 25:51.175
More awful secrets
you want to tell me,

25:51.217 --> 25:53.177
more drugs that I was dosed
with as a kid, maybe?

25:53.219 --> 25:54.971
Look, that just came out.
I'm sorry.

25:55.012 --> 25:56.681
I-I thought you-- maybe
you wanted to know the truth.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.891
Oh, okay, so you're
all about the truth.

25:58.933 --> 26:01.727
Vought is giving Compound V
to some bad fucking people,

26:01.769 --> 26:03.145
like really bad.

26:03.187 --> 26:05.189
Like, that Supe terrorist.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.567
That's insane.

26:08.609 --> 26:10.611
No, it's true.

26:10.653 --> 26:12.822
Look, my friends want to stop
it, but they got caught

26:12.863 --> 26:15.449
on Vought's orders,
and I, and I figured,

26:15.491 --> 26:18.911
because you had
security clearance,

26:18.953 --> 26:20.997
maybe you could help find them.

26:23.457 --> 26:27.044
Hughie, I was almost arrested
just for knowing you.

26:27.086 --> 26:30.047
I had to convince them that I
was an idiot that you threw out

26:30.089 --> 26:31.882
and you used,
and now you want me

26:31.924 --> 26:34.427
to help
your psycho killer friends?

26:34.468 --> 26:37.430
When you put it like that...
(chuckles)

26:37.471 --> 26:41.767
You have 30 seconds
to get the hell out of here.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.523
Okay.

26:47.565 --> 26:49.567
I'm sorry to bother you.

I mean, why the hell

26:53.404 --> 26:56.407
would I ever help you?

27:00.911 --> 27:03.622
Because Vought's up
to some evil shit?

27:05.708 --> 27:08.085
'Cause it's your job.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.340

What are you talking about?

27:36.072 --> 27:39.241
I was, I was angry after Robin.

27:39.283 --> 27:44.872
I was headed for this cliff, and
then you and me went bowling.

27:46.749 --> 27:48.125
Bowling?

27:48.167 --> 27:50.127
Yeah.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.129
Bowling.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.090
That's it.

27:54.131 --> 27:58.803
That's not saving you,
that's, that's just being there.

28:05.518 --> 28:07.520
The thing is...

28:16.487 --> 28:18.489
...I don't care.

28:27.665 --> 28:29.667
-(grunting)
-(heart beating)

28:32.294 --> 28:34.296
(metal creaking)

28:47.226 --> 28:49.979
-(horn honking)
-NATHAN: Hey!

28:50.020 --> 28:52.440
What the hell are you doing?

28:52.481 --> 28:55.276
Doc said six weeks minimum
after a fracture like that.

28:55.317 --> 28:57.153
(panting):
I'm all good, man.

28:57.194 --> 28:58.904
Look, I'm back to training.

28:58.946 --> 29:01.198
I feel fucking great.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.616
-You're healed?
-I'm healed.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.702
How the fuck are you hea...

29:04.743 --> 29:06.287
(laughs)

29:06.328 --> 29:08.747
You back on that Compound V.

29:08.789 --> 29:10.875
-(groans)
-You promised me
that you would stay clean.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.918
No. I am clean.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.212
A-1, all-natural A-Train, baby.

29:15.254 --> 29:18.841
Your fucking bones fused back
together overnight?

29:18.883 --> 29:21.635
-That sound natural to you?
-Maybe I'm just strong.

29:21.677 --> 29:25.097
-Oh, yeah.
-I am the world's fastest man.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.311
Bet you can't outrun this.

29:30.352 --> 29:33.314
Hey. Wait, hey, where you going?

29:33.355 --> 29:36.525
I'm not gonna sit here
and watch you kill yourself.

29:36.567 --> 29:41.155
(chuckles) You know what?
I don't need this shit.

29:41.197 --> 29:44.158
You've always just been jealous
of me, so go ahead,

29:44.200 --> 29:45.451
slow-ass fucking loser.

29:45.493 --> 29:46.660
(tires screeching)

29:46.702 --> 29:49.371
(grunting)

29:51.707 --> 29:54.585
(piano playing)

30:19.109 --> 30:22.363
(piano stops)

30:22.404 --> 30:26.408
Huh-- I'm just, yeah, I'm just
gonna... (clears throat)

30:38.212 --> 30:40.005
-MAN: There he is!
-WOMAN: Our hero.

30:40.047 --> 30:41.966
(cheering, applause)

30:42.007 --> 30:45.427
(laughs)
Stop it.

30:45.469 --> 30:47.096
Stop, please.

30:55.604 --> 30:59.024
Amazing. Great job, everybody.

30:59.066 --> 31:00.776
-You're gonna
make me blush here.
-EDGAR: Madelyn?

31:00.818 --> 31:03.571
-HOMELANDER: Stop, please.
-Mr. Edgar.

31:03.612 --> 31:06.240
Uh, I, uh, I didn't know
you were gonna come.

31:06.282 --> 31:08.200
Let me borrow you for a moment.

31:20.170 --> 31:21.922
(sighs)

31:21.964 --> 31:24.341
The Pentagon's shelling out
north of $40 billion per year.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.594
You should enjoy a bonus
that reflects that.

31:27.803 --> 31:30.014
I-I don't know what to say.

31:30.055 --> 31:31.432
Well, say thank you.

31:31.473 --> 31:33.851
(chuckles)
Thank you.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.853
Don't get too excited.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.479
It comes with strings.

31:37.521 --> 31:39.648
You're gonna need to move
your office down to 82.

31:39.690 --> 31:41.650
-That's your floor.
-And

31:41.692 --> 31:44.445
I'm gonna want you to start
riding shotgun on my meetings.

31:44.486 --> 31:46.488
Hey, don't go planning
my retirement yet.

31:46.530 --> 31:48.616
I'm just saying, someone
needs to run this shit show

31:48.657 --> 31:51.243
when I move to Belize.

31:51.285 --> 31:52.870
Enjoy yourself, Madelyn.

31:52.911 --> 31:56.165
Start thinking
about the view from 82.

31:57.833 --> 31:59.835
Thank you.

32:04.340 --> 32:06.884
-(clatters)
-(laughs)

32:10.179 --> 32:14.308
Electricity goes in,
blast comes out.

32:18.312 --> 32:20.481
That's a hell of a party trick.

32:20.522 --> 32:24.193
Do you ever, um, use it for fun?

32:24.234 --> 32:27.821
Can I tell you a secret?

32:27.863 --> 32:32.493
Sometimes,
my eyes light up when I...

32:32.534 --> 32:33.911
you know.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.080
(both chuckle)

32:40.959 --> 32:42.628
-Will you excuse me?
-Uh...

32:42.670 --> 32:44.922
Just a second.

32:53.639 --> 32:54.765
(Starlight vomiting)

32:54.807 --> 32:56.475
(groans)

32:56.517 --> 32:57.851
(coughs)

32:57.893 --> 32:59.937
(sighs)

32:59.978 --> 33:02.773
-You want me to hold
your hair back?
-(groans)

33:02.815 --> 33:04.942
Don't touch.
(grunts)

33:04.983 --> 33:06.193
(toilet flushes)

33:06.235 --> 33:08.112
Leave me alone,
I'm not in the mood.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.863
Not in the mood for what?

33:09.905 --> 33:10.948
(Starlight grunts)

33:10.989 --> 33:14.618
Your bottomless casual cruelty.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.412
So just make
whatever shitty comment

33:16.453 --> 33:18.163
you're gonna make and then go.

33:23.711 --> 33:25.838
(sniffles)

33:25.879 --> 33:27.715
Look.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.802
What am I supposed to be
looking at?

33:31.844 --> 33:35.973
No... my radius
never healed straight.

33:39.017 --> 33:42.229
I really did break every bone
in my right arm.

33:42.271 --> 33:44.982
-What?
-Stopping the bus from falling.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.234
You said the marketing guys
made it up.

33:49.236 --> 33:50.612
It was me.

33:52.156 --> 33:54.199
23-year-old, bright-eyed,

33:54.241 --> 33:56.702
ass you could bounce
a quarter off of...

33:56.744 --> 33:58.203
me.

34:02.458 --> 34:05.127
I really did want
to make a difference.

34:05.169 --> 34:06.795
I really did care.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.257
I was just like you.

34:12.134 --> 34:13.802
And then...

34:13.844 --> 34:17.639
I started giving pieces
of myself away and...

34:17.681 --> 34:20.434
I guess I gave away everything.

34:28.525 --> 34:30.235
So you know what? Be...

34:30.277 --> 34:32.863
just be original.

34:32.905 --> 34:34.907
For fuck's sake.

34:35.991 --> 34:38.619
My position is already taken.

34:43.373 --> 34:46.919
Be the annoying goody two-shoes
asshole that you are.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.421
(Maeve chuckles)

34:49.463 --> 34:51.757
One of us has to be.

35:01.517 --> 35:03.519
(door opens)

35:08.065 --> 35:10.067
(piano playing)

35:22.538 --> 35:24.706
HOMELANDER:
You've been avoiding me.

35:24.748 --> 35:27.125
-No, I haven't.
-Really?

35:27.167 --> 35:29.169
Seems that way.

35:31.046 --> 35:33.882
You do know that I went to see
Vogelbaum, though...

35:33.924 --> 35:35.592
right?

35:37.636 --> 35:40.180
And you do know what he told me?

35:40.222 --> 35:42.683
I never meant for you
to find out that way.

35:42.724 --> 35:45.269
Let me guess.
You wanted to protect me.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.479
Well, we all did.

35:47.521 --> 35:49.439
Of course.

35:51.441 --> 35:52.693
You think I'm fragile?

35:52.734 --> 35:54.319
No, I do not.

35:54.361 --> 35:56.154
You try doing any of this--

35:56.196 --> 35:59.283
I mean fucking any of it--

35:59.324 --> 36:01.660
without me...

36:01.702 --> 36:03.620
I couldn't.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.330
Madelyn.

36:07.583 --> 36:11.128
Did it ever occur to you that...

36:11.169 --> 36:13.630
a Supe terrorist showing up

36:13.672 --> 36:17.050
exactly when
we needed him to was...

36:17.092 --> 36:19.720
a pretty fucking
incredible coincidence?

36:21.763 --> 36:23.807
It's almost like...

36:23.849 --> 36:26.101
someone planned it.

36:27.311 --> 36:30.188
-(Madelyn sighs)
-Mm-hmm.

36:32.900 --> 36:34.860
Me.

36:37.112 --> 36:38.864
Me.

36:38.906 --> 36:40.198
I made him.

36:40.240 --> 36:44.036
What do you mean you "made him"?

36:44.077 --> 36:47.915
Well, I borrowed
some Compound V,

36:47.956 --> 36:50.626
had A-Train run it
all over the globe,

36:50.667 --> 36:53.545
and I supercharged some jihadis.

36:54.588 --> 36:56.256
(chuckles)

36:56.298 --> 36:58.258
Uh, not to oversimplify it.

36:58.300 --> 36:59.801
I mean, it-it was actually
very difficult

36:59.843 --> 37:02.596
and very messy,
using adult subjects.

37:02.638 --> 37:04.932
There's a good reason
that Vought doesn't do it.

37:04.973 --> 37:07.684
But... well, enough survived

37:07.726 --> 37:11.480
to call the operation
a huge success.

37:12.522 --> 37:15.067
Huge.

37:15.108 --> 37:16.985
And now...

37:17.027 --> 37:22.199
we have villains
all over the globe...

37:22.240 --> 37:25.118
that only we can fight.

37:26.119 --> 37:29.706
In sequel after sequel...

37:29.748 --> 37:31.625
after sequel.

37:36.046 --> 37:38.465
Well?

37:41.009 --> 37:42.552
Say something.

37:56.483 --> 37:58.485
(Madelyn moans)

38:04.866 --> 38:06.785
No.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.540
Take off your pants.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.765
Sit down.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.786
(both grunt)

38:53.623 --> 38:55.584
(exhales)

38:55.625 --> 38:57.085
-Gentle.
-I'm...

38:57.127 --> 38:59.588
(grunts)

38:59.629 --> 39:01.173
No.

39:02.174 --> 39:05.093
(exhales)

39:05.135 --> 39:07.137
(Homelander grunting)

39:08.346 --> 39:11.016
Oh, my sweet boy.

39:11.058 --> 39:15.270
My special, special, sweet boy.

39:15.312 --> 39:17.856
-(grunts)
-(moans)

39:17.898 --> 39:19.941
I'm gonna take care of you.

39:19.983 --> 39:21.985
(grunting loudly)

39:26.490 --> 39:28.283
I'm sorry.

39:28.325 --> 39:30.368
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39:30.410 --> 39:32.746
-No, you did good.
-(exhaling): I'm sorry.

39:32.788 --> 39:35.082
-Oh, my boy.
-(panting)

39:35.123 --> 39:37.626
I'm proud of you.

39:37.667 --> 39:39.711
That was so lovely.

39:42.881 --> 39:45.884
Well, you know,
in, uh, medieval times,

39:45.926 --> 39:48.261
they locked prisoners
inside a pillory barrel.

39:50.180 --> 39:51.598
Then they'd kneel
in their own excrement

39:51.640 --> 39:54.351
till they got sepsis
and died, so...

39:55.519 --> 39:58.146
Thank you, Frenchie,

39:58.188 --> 40:01.858
for that disgusting
yet fascinating piece of trivia.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.985
I'm just saying
it could be worse, huh?

40:04.027 --> 40:05.487
Right.

40:06.530 --> 40:08.532
(sighs)

40:11.952 --> 40:14.079
Why didn't you tell us?

40:14.121 --> 40:16.623
Tell you what?

40:16.665 --> 40:18.458
That you had a daughter.

40:22.462 --> 40:24.923
I don't know.

40:24.965 --> 40:26.424
I mean...

40:28.426 --> 40:30.095
I guess she's...

40:32.139 --> 40:34.432
...the only good thing
I ever did, man.

40:36.726 --> 40:39.813
I just wanted just to leave her
clean out of it, you know?

40:41.815 --> 40:44.025
But I fucked that up
to high heaven.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.988
Probably never see her again.

40:48.029 --> 40:50.031
I understand.

40:52.868 --> 40:54.452
She made you a better person.

41:00.041 --> 41:02.878
Hey, man.

41:02.919 --> 41:04.838
Kimiko's gonna be okay.

41:07.090 --> 41:09.885
So you do know her name.

41:09.926 --> 41:11.636
-Hmm.
-MADELYN: Do you like that?

41:13.430 --> 41:15.515
-No.
-(Madelyn chuckles)

41:18.268 --> 41:20.270
Um...

41:20.312 --> 41:22.731
Mr. Edgar came
to the party tonight

41:22.772 --> 41:26.318
and he practically
offered me his job.

41:26.359 --> 41:27.986
Well, not right away.

41:28.028 --> 41:29.905
But he, um...

41:29.946 --> 41:31.573
wants me to move
to the 82nd floor

41:31.615 --> 41:33.200
so that I can be closer to him.

41:33.241 --> 41:34.826
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

41:34.868 --> 41:38.246
Okay, but y-you'll still be
my day-to-day, right?

41:38.288 --> 41:40.498
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

41:40.540 --> 41:42.459
Of course.

41:42.500 --> 41:45.170
I will be there for you always.

41:45.212 --> 41:46.922
Okay, good.

41:49.799 --> 41:51.301
Good.

41:53.345 --> 41:55.222
Madelyn.

41:55.263 --> 41:56.723
From now on,

41:56.765 --> 41:58.934
no more secrets.

42:00.936 --> 42:02.520
Promise me.

42:02.562 --> 42:05.190
I promise.

42:05.232 --> 42:06.816
No more secrets.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.653
Okay.

42:13.114 --> 42:16.201
I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you about your baby.

42:18.328 --> 42:19.746
It's just that...

42:19.788 --> 42:22.624
you carry so much, and...

42:24.668 --> 42:27.504
...the pain of losing
a child to...

42:27.545 --> 42:29.589
miscarriage is...

42:31.675 --> 42:33.885
I just wanted
to spare you that burden.

42:33.927 --> 42:36.179
Do you understand?

42:36.221 --> 42:38.223
Yes.

42:47.899 --> 42:49.859
(clicks)

42:49.901 --> 42:51.903
(exhales)

43:04.541 --> 43:05.750
(Hughie grunts, yells)

43:05.792 --> 43:07.168
What the fuck?!

43:07.210 --> 43:09.212
(door unlocks)

43:11.131 --> 43:12.674
(Hughie panting)

43:16.845 --> 43:18.888
-(Hughie grunts)
-MOTHER'S MILK:
Hey, easy with him, man.

43:18.930 --> 43:21.933
Fuck wrong with you? Shit.

43:21.975 --> 43:24.853
-(door slams, locks)
-Bitch ass.

43:24.894 --> 43:26.271
You okay? You break any bones?

43:26.313 --> 43:27.647
-No, no. No.
-No?

43:27.689 --> 43:29.024
Did they get Butcher, too?

43:29.065 --> 43:31.151
-No.
-They got you separated?

43:31.192 --> 43:32.652
When? When?

43:32.694 --> 43:34.029
Well, um,

43:34.070 --> 43:36.114
he went after Homelander.

43:36.156 --> 43:37.407
But I...

43:37.449 --> 43:39.701
(muffled):
I came to save you.

43:39.743 --> 43:42.579
Yay. (chuckles weakly)

43:42.620 --> 43:45.915
So, you came here?
You meant to come here?

43:45.957 --> 43:47.834
-Without Butcher.
-Yeah.

43:48.877 --> 43:50.712
C'est incroyable.

43:52.422 --> 43:53.840
HUGHIE:
Oh...

43:55.842 --> 43:58.053
Never has a man
thrown his life away so...

43:58.094 --> 43:59.888
completely like
you've thrown yours away today.

43:59.929 --> 44:01.806
No...

44:01.848 --> 44:04.476
no, what I mean is,
you rescuing us

44:04.517 --> 44:07.687
is the most useless,
futile gesture I can think of.

44:07.729 --> 44:09.606
-Yeah, I-I got it.
-Unbelievable.

44:09.647 --> 44:11.399
-All right, so what's the plan?
-Okay.

44:11.441 --> 44:13.026
Okay, um...

44:13.068 --> 44:14.611
all right, so they searched me.

44:14.652 --> 44:16.738
Very, very thoroughly.

44:16.780 --> 44:20.325
But I managed to Poligrip
in my 12th grade retainer.

44:20.367 --> 44:21.868
-Let me see.
-So it looks
like a permanent bridge,

44:21.910 --> 44:23.870
-and it totally worked.
-Shit.

44:23.912 --> 44:25.789
Frenchie, you can pick a lock
with anything, right?

44:25.830 --> 44:28.124
-(Frenchie exclaims)
-There's premium metal wire
in this thing.

44:28.166 --> 44:30.543
-Come on, take it out.
-Okay, one second.

44:30.585 --> 44:33.338
MOTHER'S MILK:
Come on, man.
Spit that bitch out.

44:33.380 --> 44:35.382
-(mutters) It's stuck.
-(Frenchie shushes)

44:35.423 --> 44:37.217
-Okay, okay, stand still.
-Wait, what?

44:37.258 --> 44:38.635
-Stand still. Open.
-What...

44:38.676 --> 44:41.221
-Open the mouth... (mutters)
-(Hughie grunts)

44:41.262 --> 44:42.847
Come on, get up in there,
Frenchie.

44:42.889 --> 44:44.307
(Hughie grunts)

44:44.349 --> 44:46.559
MOTHER'S MILK:
Just go deeper.
Just a little deeper.

44:46.601 --> 44:47.602
All right, all right, all right,
h-h-hold...

44:47.644 --> 44:48.812
-whoa, whoa, whoa.
-(gags)

44:48.853 --> 44:50.063
HUGHIE:
What the fuck, man?

44:50.105 --> 44:51.898
Let me get this.
Let me get this.

44:51.940 --> 44:53.858
-(panting)
-Relax, okay?

44:53.900 --> 44:57.028
-Look. Look, focus. Focus.
-Okay, okay. What?

44:57.070 --> 44:58.363
I'm-a knock that bitch
out your mouth.

44:58.405 --> 45:00.198
-Okay?
-We're not at that step yet.

45:00.240 --> 45:01.699
-We don't have to do that.
-(stammers)

45:01.741 --> 45:03.118
It's just gonna sting
a little bit. A'ight?

45:03.159 --> 45:04.661
-Sting?
-On three.

45:04.702 --> 45:06.496
-One to three.
-Okay, well,
if you count down...

45:06.538 --> 45:08.957
-(grunts, groans)
-MOTHER'S MILK: You all right?

45:08.998 --> 45:10.333
-(groans)
-You okay, buddy?

45:10.375 --> 45:12.293
-FRENCHIE: Yes.
-MOTHER'S MILK: Yes!

45:12.335 --> 45:14.337
-(Frenchie shushing)
-MOTHER'S MILK:
Good job, Hughie.

45:14.379 --> 45:16.381
(guard grunts)

45:27.392 --> 45:29.394
(camera beeping)

45:37.110 --> 45:38.445
DRIVER:
Good night, Ms. Stillwell.

45:38.486 --> 45:39.863
Good night, Miles.

45:39.904 --> 45:41.406
(door closes)

45:41.448 --> 45:43.324
Maria.

45:47.203 --> 45:49.456
Maria, I'm home.

45:52.459 --> 45:53.960
Maria?

45:54.002 --> 45:56.087
BUTCHER:
Your kid's a sound sleeper.

46:05.013 --> 46:06.598
Don't worry.

46:06.639 --> 46:08.766
He's all right.

46:08.808 --> 46:10.477
So's the nanny.

46:10.518 --> 46:13.396
She's out the back sleeping off
a little bit of propofol.

46:16.441 --> 46:18.026
Put your phone on the table.

46:34.042 --> 46:35.877
William Butcher.

46:38.421 --> 46:40.632
CIA showed me your file.

46:42.675 --> 46:44.761
-What do you want?
-You know what I want.

46:44.802 --> 46:47.222
I don't know how
breaking into my home

46:47.263 --> 46:50.225
and threatening my child
is gonna get you Homelander.

46:50.266 --> 46:51.768
All these years...

46:51.809 --> 46:54.229
I've been searching
for that cunt's weakness.

46:54.270 --> 46:56.231
He doesn't have any weakness.

46:56.272 --> 46:58.733
-No?
-There isn't a weapon on Earth

46:58.775 --> 47:00.735
that they haven't thrown at him.

47:00.777 --> 47:02.320
They've all failed.

47:02.362 --> 47:04.572
That's not
what I'm talking about.

47:06.032 --> 47:09.369
I'm talking... about you.

47:09.410 --> 47:11.204
Me?

47:11.246 --> 47:14.749
Yeah, you're the only thing
he gives two shits about.

47:16.292 --> 47:17.877
You're his weakness.

47:25.802 --> 47:27.679
It's a fucking maze.

47:27.720 --> 47:29.347
Where is she?

47:34.561 --> 47:36.604
Ready... go on.

47:44.571 --> 47:46.698
Mon coeur.

47:46.739 --> 47:48.491
Frenchie, what the fuck?

47:48.533 --> 47:50.535
(monitors beeping steadily)

48:05.133 --> 48:07.176
-Fuck! Move. Move.
-(Frenchie groaning)

48:15.560 --> 48:16.978
(panting)

48:19.314 --> 48:20.857
Fuck.

48:20.898 --> 48:22.317
(grunts)

48:25.320 --> 48:27.697
-No! God.
-Just stay down.

48:29.907 --> 48:31.951
(panting)

48:36.039 --> 48:38.416
Aw, fuck.

48:38.458 --> 48:40.501
She better be fucking worth it.

48:40.543 --> 48:42.211
Wait, what?

48:42.253 --> 48:43.921
-You cover him. Cover him!
-Wait, what?

48:43.963 --> 48:45.465
No, I don't-- I don't--
I can't do this.

48:45.506 --> 48:47.258
You just pull the fucking
trigger right now!

48:47.300 --> 48:49.594
-Okay!
-(shouting)

48:49.636 --> 48:51.596
Sorry! I'm sorry!

48:51.638 --> 48:52.722
(shouting)

48:54.557 --> 48:56.100
Shit, it's out, it's out.
What do I do?

48:56.142 --> 48:58.102
Take this. Take it.

48:58.144 --> 48:59.896
-Reload.
-What the fuck
do I know about reloading?

48:59.937 --> 49:01.606
Reload the magazine.

49:01.648 --> 49:03.816
How do I do that? Okay.

49:03.858 --> 49:05.568
-Let's go.
-Good? It's good.

49:05.610 --> 49:07.362
(shouts)

49:08.655 --> 49:09.947
(panting)

49:11.824 --> 49:15.036
M.M.! M.M.!

49:20.458 --> 49:21.459
M.M.!

49:23.544 --> 49:24.504
Go!

49:24.545 --> 49:26.964
(screaming)

49:28.049 --> 49:29.842
(grunting)

49:36.724 --> 49:39.811
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

49:39.852 --> 49:42.313
(panting):
I'm out.

49:45.650 --> 49:46.901
-Oh, shit.
-Drop your weapon!
-Get down!

49:46.943 --> 49:48.277
-Okay, okay, okay. Okay.
-On your knees.

49:48.319 --> 49:50.029
-Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
-On your fucking knees!

49:50.071 --> 49:52.073
Face the wall!

49:52.115 --> 49:54.659
Hands on your heads!

49:59.038 --> 50:01.207
(agents screaming)

50:22.979 --> 50:25.273
(grunting)

50:35.700 --> 50:37.702
(laughs softly)

50:39.746 --> 50:41.622
You came.

50:44.208 --> 50:46.210
Like you said...

50:47.879 --> 50:50.381
I'm a fucking superhero.

50:52.258 --> 50:55.386
-(grunting)
-Come on.

50:55.428 --> 50:57.388
Hughie, check the doors.

50:57.430 --> 50:59.223
(panting)

50:59.265 --> 51:00.641
Is it working?

51:00.683 --> 51:02.268
-No, no, no, um...
-Fuck.

51:02.310 --> 51:04.645
Try this.

51:04.687 --> 51:06.981
Yes.

51:09.108 --> 51:10.693
-(shouts) Son of a...
-HUGHIE: Go, go, go.

51:10.735 --> 51:14.238
-Go. Go, go, go.
-A-TRAIN: Holy shit.

51:16.908 --> 51:18.868
Oh, shit. Go.

51:18.910 --> 51:22.121
-Hughie, let's go.
-Go! I'll be okay. Go.

51:23.581 --> 51:25.583
(heart beating)

51:28.044 --> 51:30.505
A-TRAIN:
Homelander was right.

51:31.756 --> 51:34.342
You are a fucking rat.

51:36.677 --> 51:39.472
Oh, and you're the jailbreaker?

51:39.514 --> 51:42.433
Are you fucking kidding me?

51:42.475 --> 51:44.852
Turn around and walk away,
A-Train.

51:44.894 --> 51:46.771
(laughs)

51:46.813 --> 51:48.231
I got this. Go.

51:48.272 --> 51:51.234
No. I'm the one he wants.

51:51.275 --> 51:53.277
I'm not leaving you.

52:02.453 --> 52:05.414
Please, just go.

52:07.500 --> 52:09.502
(exhales)

52:28.688 --> 52:30.773
(knuckles crack)

52:59.510 --> 53:01.262
(grunts)

53:05.182 --> 53:06.392
(groans)

53:07.435 --> 53:09.437
Hughie!

53:09.478 --> 53:13.232
You killed the only person
I've ever loved.

53:13.274 --> 53:16.110
I didn't kill her.

53:16.152 --> 53:18.154
(labored breathing)

53:20.448 --> 53:22.450
I know.

53:23.910 --> 53:25.912
I did.

53:29.248 --> 53:31.250
(heart beating)

53:34.795 --> 53:36.964
But it was your fault.

53:38.215 --> 53:40.217
(shouts)

53:42.845 --> 53:44.013
(grunts)

53:44.055 --> 53:46.057
(heart beating rapidly)

53:49.769 --> 53:52.772
(grunts)

53:52.813 --> 53:54.982
(heart stops)

53:55.024 --> 53:57.610
(shouts)

54:00.029 --> 54:01.906
Holy shit.

54:01.948 --> 54:03.950
What? What?

54:05.368 --> 54:09.246
I-I think he's having
a heart attack.

54:09.288 --> 54:12.875
(gasps, exhales)

54:15.711 --> 54:17.588
Oh, fuck.

54:17.630 --> 54:19.590
All right.

54:22.718 --> 54:26.097
One, two, three.

54:26.138 --> 54:28.099
Call an ambulance.

54:28.140 --> 54:30.059
One...

54:30.101 --> 54:32.269
He'll never stop coming for you.

54:32.311 --> 54:34.438
I know.

54:39.360 --> 54:41.153
This is Starlight.

54:41.195 --> 54:44.073
I have a code 78-65.
A-Train is down.

54:44.115 --> 54:46.909
I think he's had a heart attack.

54:48.995 --> 54:50.997
You have to go. I'll take over.

54:52.999 --> 54:54.792
Hughie, go!

54:54.834 --> 54:56.836
Or else you'll get caught.

55:07.972 --> 55:09.974
(door opening)

55:14.979 --> 55:16.981
(grunts)

55:22.695 --> 55:24.697
(thunder rolls)

55:31.829 --> 55:34.540
(whooshing)

55:34.582 --> 55:36.250
(thudding)

55:38.919 --> 55:41.380
Well, well, well.

55:41.422 --> 55:44.133
About fucking time.

55:45.885 --> 55:48.387
I know you can see
through the ceiling.

55:49.638 --> 55:53.017
You try to kill me...

55:53.059 --> 55:56.437
and my trigger finger goes soft.

55:56.479 --> 56:02.318
Now... why don't you stop
playing rapey Santa...

56:02.359 --> 56:04.361
and come down and join us?

56:08.407 --> 56:11.327
(shushing)

56:11.368 --> 56:13.162
Take it easy.

56:13.204 --> 56:15.331
We don't want
to upset Teddy, right?

56:15.372 --> 56:17.333
MADELYN:
What are you doing?

56:17.374 --> 56:19.043
Hey, look: Mommy.

56:19.085 --> 56:20.044
You all right?

56:20.086 --> 56:21.629
-No.
-Madelyn...

56:21.670 --> 56:22.630
Take him upstairs.

56:22.671 --> 56:24.632
All good. I got it.

56:24.673 --> 56:26.759
I got it.

56:32.807 --> 56:34.767
Billy Butcher.

56:34.809 --> 56:37.853
You don't mind
if I call you Billy, right?

56:37.895 --> 56:39.855
Y-You are
pretty darn impressive.

56:39.897 --> 56:44.735
I mean, especially for,
you know, one of you.

56:44.777 --> 56:48.531
See, even now, most people
standing where-where you are

56:48.572 --> 56:51.117
would be pissing their pants
terrified, but you...

56:51.158 --> 56:56.664
uh, sure, y-your heart's
pounding, but you're not afraid.

56:56.705 --> 56:58.082
(Teddy crying)

56:58.124 --> 56:59.500
It's anger.

56:59.542 --> 57:01.377
That's a new one for me.

57:01.418 --> 57:05.297
Homelander, will you please
take the baby upstairs?

57:05.339 --> 57:09.468
All because
of your lovely wife Becca.

57:09.510 --> 57:10.886
Right?

57:10.928 --> 57:13.097
Okay. Let's cut
the bullshit, huh?

57:13.139 --> 57:15.141
You know that we, uh...

57:15.182 --> 57:18.936
Uh, bro, not my fault, okay?

57:18.978 --> 57:21.522
-She came on to me. It happens.
-Will you stop?

57:21.564 --> 57:23.315
HOMELANDER:
You know, it's-it's the fame.
They get crushes.

57:23.357 --> 57:24.900
There's nothing
I can do about it.

57:24.942 --> 57:28.571
But what I will tell you is,
she was a hell of a lay.

57:28.612 --> 57:30.156
(laughs):
Oh!

57:30.197 --> 57:32.158
She came three times, eh?

57:32.199 --> 57:33.742
Three times.

57:33.784 --> 57:36.203
All right, little man,
have a little lie-down.

57:36.245 --> 57:37.746
Good boy.

57:37.788 --> 57:39.540
I want you to take him
out of here.

57:39.582 --> 57:41.125
There you go.

57:41.167 --> 57:42.918
(brushes hands)

57:42.960 --> 57:45.546
(sighs)

57:45.588 --> 57:47.673
But that's not really it.

57:47.715 --> 57:49.675
No, no, no, no, no.

57:50.718 --> 57:53.345
No, it's more than just that.

57:55.848 --> 58:00.186
You think I'm responsible
for her death, don't you?

58:00.227 --> 58:01.896
So now

58:01.937 --> 58:07.234
you have a hostage
that-that I care about, right?

58:07.276 --> 58:09.195
Someone I love.

58:09.236 --> 58:13.866
So, what's your plan...
from here?

58:13.908 --> 58:15.284
Uh, what do you want?

58:15.326 --> 58:17.620
Do you want a confession, or...

58:17.661 --> 58:19.747
What's your endgame?

58:25.419 --> 58:29.006
I'm just gonna hurt you.

58:29.048 --> 58:32.718
I mean really fucking hurt you,

58:32.760 --> 58:34.929
and that will be
good enough for me.

58:34.970 --> 58:39.099
So, y-you don't really want
anything, per se?

58:39.141 --> 58:42.645
You just, you want to blow her
up in front of me.

58:42.686 --> 58:44.355
Right?

58:44.396 --> 58:48.067
(laughs):
Wow, fuck.

58:49.610 --> 58:52.655
Uh...
(stammers)

58:52.696 --> 58:56.116
You are dark,
and I kind of like it.

58:56.158 --> 58:58.577
Will you please
take Teddy upstairs?

58:58.619 --> 59:02.122
It's okay.
(shushing)

59:02.164 --> 59:05.417
Just answer one question for me.

59:05.459 --> 59:07.711
Just one.

59:07.753 --> 59:09.755
How do you know?

59:11.590 --> 59:13.217
How do you know?

59:13.259 --> 59:17.054
I mean, you must have
some rock-solid proof, right?

59:17.096 --> 59:21.058
That it was actually me
who killed your wife.

59:21.100 --> 59:24.687
You must have that, right?
So what is it?

59:24.728 --> 59:28.357
Share. We're all
very interested.

59:29.984 --> 59:32.820
Now's not the time
to be strong and silent.

59:32.861 --> 59:34.321
Go for it.

59:34.363 --> 59:36.323
(Teddy crying)

59:36.365 --> 59:40.828
Are you telling me
that this whole thing

59:40.869 --> 59:45.249
i-is based on fucking feelings?

59:45.291 --> 59:47.042
-On a hunch?
-Will you please

59:47.084 --> 59:49.003
-take him upstairs?
-A little bit--
Madelyn, hold on.

59:49.044 --> 59:51.797
-Take him upstairs!
-Shut the fuck up!

59:56.218 --> 59:58.220
Excuse me.

59:59.471 --> 1:00:02.641
You promised me no more lies.

1:00:02.683 --> 1:00:06.312
You fucking promised me.

1:00:07.896 --> 1:00:12.026
You and Vogelbaum should have
got your stories straight.

1:00:12.067 --> 1:00:14.028
They were so close.

1:00:14.069 --> 1:00:17.573
So fucking close, but there
was a few little details

1:00:17.614 --> 1:00:20.117
that were different.

1:00:20.159 --> 1:00:22.328
So I went back to Vogelbaum,

1:00:22.369 --> 1:00:25.914
and I managed to squeeze
the truth out of him.

1:00:25.956 --> 1:00:28.250
The real truth.

1:00:31.378 --> 1:00:34.923
Yes, that's it.

1:00:36.133 --> 1:00:38.385
(whispering indistinctly)

1:00:42.598 --> 1:00:44.558
I'm so sorry.

1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:47.561
I should never have lied to you.

1:00:47.603 --> 1:00:51.565
I know now that you don't need
to be protected.

1:00:51.607 --> 1:00:53.567
I'm so sorry.

1:00:53.609 --> 1:00:56.070
(crying): Will you please
take Teddy upstairs?

1:00:56.111 --> 1:00:59.740
(Homelander exhales)

1:00:59.782 --> 1:01:02.618
Did you ever really care
about me?

1:01:02.659 --> 1:01:04.286
You mean everything to me.

1:01:04.328 --> 1:01:06.288
No.

1:01:06.330 --> 1:01:07.623
No, no.

1:01:07.664 --> 1:01:10.667
I mean everything to your job.

1:01:12.294 --> 1:01:14.254
You care more
about that fucking baby

1:01:14.296 --> 1:01:15.964
-than you do about me.
-No.

1:01:16.006 --> 1:01:17.966
I love you.

1:01:18.008 --> 1:01:20.344
I love you. I love you.
I swear I love you.

1:01:20.386 --> 1:01:22.930
But?

1:01:22.971 --> 1:01:27.267
Tell me the truth,
or I walk out right now.

1:01:31.313 --> 1:01:33.315
I'm scared.

1:01:34.900 --> 1:01:36.902
I'm scared of you.

1:01:38.904 --> 1:01:40.364
What?

1:01:40.406 --> 1:01:42.199
I said I'm scared.

1:01:42.241 --> 1:01:44.868
-Of?
-Of you.

1:01:44.910 --> 1:01:47.579
I'm scared of you.

1:01:47.621 --> 1:01:50.082
Thank you.

1:01:51.083 --> 1:01:54.503
Thank you
for finally being honest.

1:02:02.553 --> 1:02:06.140
(Homelander sighs deeply)

1:02:17.025 --> 1:02:19.319
(gasps)

1:02:33.792 --> 1:02:37.796
(sighing deeply)

1:02:42.759 --> 1:02:44.720
(sighs)

1:02:44.761 --> 1:02:46.763
Now...

1:02:49.141 --> 1:02:52.102
...what was that plan again?

1:02:53.145 --> 1:02:55.481
Oh, well...

1:02:59.526 --> 1:03:01.528
(sprinkler whirring)

1:03:19.421 --> 1:03:22.049
Wakey, wakey.

1:03:22.090 --> 1:03:24.051
Hey, buddy.

1:03:24.092 --> 1:03:26.345
You were out for quite a while.

1:03:26.386 --> 1:03:29.306
You can thank me for, uh,
saving you sometime later,

1:03:29.348 --> 1:03:31.600
but, for now,

1:03:31.642 --> 1:03:32.726
time to get up.

1:03:32.768 --> 1:03:34.478
Come on. You're gonna love this.

1:03:34.520 --> 1:03:36.522
-Come on.
-(door opens)

1:03:40.817 --> 1:03:42.110
Mom!

1:03:42.152 --> 1:03:45.155
Wow,
look at this handsome devil.

1:03:47.157 --> 1:03:49.743
Hey, pal.

1:03:49.785 --> 1:03:51.286
You know who I am?

1:03:51.328 --> 1:03:52.829
BOY:
Homelander.

1:03:52.871 --> 1:03:55.832
HOMELANDER (laughs):
Yeah, that's right, but...

1:03:55.874 --> 1:03:57.709
("Sleepwalk"
by The Shadows playing)

1:03:57.751 --> 1:03:59.711
...you know who else?

1:03:59.753 --> 1:04:01.505
No.

1:04:07.636 --> 1:04:09.596
Becca?

1:04:09.638 --> 1:04:11.682
-What?
-HOMELANDER: Huh.

1:04:11.723 --> 1:04:13.725
Mommy didn't tell you.

1:04:15.727 --> 1:04:17.729
Well...

1:04:21.275 --> 1:04:23.235
I'm your father,

1:04:23.277 --> 1:04:28.156
and we are a family.

1:04:29.157 --> 1:04:30.826
(Homelander chuckles)
