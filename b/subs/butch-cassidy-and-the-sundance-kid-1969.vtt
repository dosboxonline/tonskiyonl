04:42.562 --> 04:44.723
- Good night, Pat.
- Good night.

04:47.867 --> 04:52.327
- What happened? Old bank was beautiful.
- People kept robbing it.

04:52.405 --> 04:54.930
It's a small price to pay for beauty.

05:01.013 --> 05:03.106
Hit me.

05:06.552 --> 05:08.383
Again.

05:10.823 --> 05:12.347
Bust!

05:14.794 --> 05:16.785
Give me credit, Mr Macon?

05:16.896 --> 05:18.955
You know my rules, Tom.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.933
Well, looks like you just about
cleaned everybody out, fella.

05:24.003 --> 05:26.904
You haven't lost a hand
since you got the deal.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.131
What's the secret of your success?

05:33.212 --> 05:35.305
Prayer.

05:35.815 --> 05:37.908
Let's just you and me play.

05:54.967 --> 05:57.026
Hit it.

06:00.773 --> 06:02.832
Bust!

06:05.244 --> 06:08.042
Yeah. You're a hell of a card player, fella.

06:08.814 --> 06:11.476
I know, cos I'm a hell of a card player.

06:13.019 --> 06:15.954
And I can't even spot how you're cheatin'.

06:29.468 --> 06:31.800
The money stays and you go.

06:35.408 --> 06:39.572
Well, we seem to be a little short
on brotherly love around here.

06:39.645 --> 06:43.411
- If you're with him, you better get out of here.
- We're on our way.

06:44.016 --> 06:45.574
- Come on.
- I wasn't cheating.

06:45.651 --> 06:46.982
- Come on!
- I wasn't!

06:47.053 --> 06:51.114
You can die.
For that matter, you can both die.

06:51.223 --> 06:53.657
- Hear that?
- If he invites us to stay, we'll go.

06:53.793 --> 06:58.059
- We were gonna leave anyway.
- He's gotta invite us to stick around.

06:59.231 --> 07:03.031
He'll draw on you. He's ready.
You don't know how fast he is.

07:11.243 --> 07:15.543
- I'm over the hill, but it can happen to you.
- That's just what I wanna hear.

07:15.648 --> 07:18.549
Every day you get older. Now, that's a law.

07:29.495 --> 07:32.726
What would you think about
maybe asking us to stick around?

07:32.865 --> 07:35.163
- What?
- You don't have to mean it.

07:35.267 --> 07:38.134
Just ask us to stick around. I promise you...

07:45.978 --> 07:48.276
I can't help you, Sundance.

07:58.891 --> 08:03.453
I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid
when I said you were cheatin'.

08:06.399 --> 08:09.527
If I draw on you, you'll kill me.

08:09.602 --> 08:12.264
There's that possibility.

08:12.338 --> 08:17.002
No. You'd be killin' yourself. So why
don't you just invite us to stick around?

08:19.512 --> 08:21.480
Now, you can do it.

08:21.547 --> 08:23.879
And easy. Come on.

08:26.285 --> 08:28.344
Come on.

08:30.823 --> 08:32.813
Why don't you stick around?

08:32.957 --> 08:35.620
Thanks, but we gotta get goin'.

08:42.168 --> 08:43.965
Hey, Kid.

08:44.035 --> 08:46.334
Hey, Kid! How good are ya?

08:57.716 --> 09:00.412
Like I been tellin' you, over the hill.

09:57.877 --> 10:03.406
Boy, every time I see Hole in the Wall again,
it's like seein' it fresh for the first time.

10:03.482 --> 10:07.441
And every time that happens
I keep askin' myself the same question.

10:07.520 --> 10:11.081
How can I be so damn stupid
as to keep comin' back here?

10:16.462 --> 10:19.397
- What's your idea this time?
- Bolivia.

10:21.867 --> 10:25.928
- What's Bolivia?
- Bolivia. That's a country, stupid.

10:26.071 --> 10:29.063
In Central or South America. One or the other.

10:30.209 --> 10:32.404
Why don't we just go to Mexico instead?

10:32.478 --> 10:36.141
Cos all they got in Mexico is sweat.
There's too much of that here.

10:36.248 --> 10:39.877
If we'd been in business in the California
gold rush, where'd we have gone?

10:39.952 --> 10:41.647
- California, right?
- Right.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.746
So when I say Bolivia,
you just think California.

10:47.459 --> 10:51.919
You wouldn't believe what they're
findin' in the ground down there.

10:52.031 --> 10:54.625
Silver mines, gold mines, tin mines.

10:54.700 --> 10:58.329
Payrolls so heavy
we'd strain ourselves stealin' 'em.

11:00.573 --> 11:04.339
You just keep thinkin', Butch.
That's what you're good at!

11:04.443 --> 11:08.345
Boy, I got vision and
the rest of the world wears bifocals.

11:30.536 --> 11:32.697
Hi, News. Whatcha doin'?

11:32.771 --> 11:35.968
Oh, howdy, Butch. Nothin'.

11:36.075 --> 11:37.770
Nothin'.

11:37.876 --> 11:39.343
Howdy, Sundance.

11:39.545 --> 11:42.810
Well, you sure are.
You're doin' somethin'. What?

11:46.318 --> 11:50.550
Just fixin' to rob the Union Pacific Flyer,
Butch. That's all we had in mind.

11:52.024 --> 11:54.993
You fellas got everything I told you all wrong.

11:55.227 --> 11:57.787
True, we might hit the Flyer,

11:57.896 --> 12:01.764
but even ifwe do, it won't be this run.
It'll be the next one - the return.

12:01.834 --> 12:05.634
- Sundance and me been checking the banks.
- No banks.

12:05.738 --> 12:07.603
What?

12:08.407 --> 12:10.898
The Flyer, Butch.

12:12.111 --> 12:15.308
Fellas, bad as they are,
banks are better than trains.

12:15.381 --> 12:19.147
They don't move. They stay put.
You know the money's in there.

12:19.251 --> 12:22.618
- When I left I gave orders.
- New orders been given.

12:22.721 --> 12:24.780
Well, I run things here, Harvey.

12:25.457 --> 12:27.516
Used to you did.

12:27.593 --> 12:29.652
Me now.

12:30.796 --> 12:32.855
This don't concern you!

12:35.167 --> 12:39.069
- You tell him to stay out.
- Well, he goes his own way like always.

12:40.539 --> 12:43.167
What's the matter with you guys?

12:43.242 --> 12:45.938
When I came here, you weren't even a gang.
I formed ya!

12:46.011 --> 12:48.536
- Who says?
- Well, read 'em a clippin', News.

12:48.614 --> 12:50.878
- Which one?
- Any of 'em!

12:55.821 --> 12:58.881
This one here's from the SaltLake Herald.

12:58.991 --> 13:04.793
- "Butch Cassidy's Hole in the Wall Gang..."
- Butch Cassidy's gang - that's me!

13:04.863 --> 13:08.959
You want Harvey to do your plannin'?
To do your thinkin'? To run things?

13:09.034 --> 13:11.798
- "..outlaws with them on..."
- Shut up now, News!

13:11.870 --> 13:13.997
Not till I get to the good part, Butch.

13:14.073 --> 13:19.477
"Known to have participated in the holdup
are Flat Nose Curry and News Carver."

13:19.578 --> 13:23.173
I just love to read my name in the paper,
Butch.

13:23.248 --> 13:26.217
OK, so we forget about Logan takin' over.
OK, Flat Nose?

13:26.285 --> 13:28.913
You always said any one of us
could challenge you.

13:29.021 --> 13:33.856
- It's cos I figured no one would do it.
- Figured wrong, Butch.

13:34.526 --> 13:37.017
You guys can't want Logan!

13:38.097 --> 13:42.090
At least he's with us, Butch.
You've been spendin' a lot of time gone.

13:42.201 --> 13:44.669
- Cos everything's different.
- Guns or knives?

13:44.737 --> 13:49.674
- It's harder now. You gotta plan more.
- Guns or knives?!

13:50.642 --> 13:52.337
- Neither.
- Pick!

13:52.478 --> 13:54.946
I don't wanna shoot with you, Harvey.

13:56.048 --> 13:58.312
Anything you say, Butch.

14:14.299 --> 14:17.234
Maybe there's a way to make a profit in this.

14:18.570 --> 14:20.765
Bet on Logan.

14:20.873 --> 14:24.036
- I would, but who'd bet on you?
- Sundance,

14:25.477 --> 14:30.244
when we're done, if he's dead,
you're welcome to stay.

14:31.283 --> 14:36.482
Listen, I don't mean to be a sore loser,
but when it's done, if I'm dead, kill him.

14:36.555 --> 14:38.648
Love to.

14:48.200 --> 14:52.193
No, no, not yet. Not until me and Harvey
get the rules straightened out.

14:52.304 --> 14:55.205
Rules? In a knife fight? No rules!

14:56.942 --> 15:00.309
If there ain't no rules, let's start.
Someone count 1, 2, 3, go.

15:00.379 --> 15:02.472
1, 2, 3, go!

15:05.384 --> 15:08.114
I was really rootin' for you, Butch.

15:08.187 --> 15:10.155
Well, thank you, Flat Nose.

15:10.989 --> 15:14.117
That's what sustained me
in my time of trouble.

15:15.794 --> 15:18.354
Hey, what's this about the Flyer?

15:18.430 --> 15:21.194
Harvey said we'd hit it
both this run and the return.

15:21.300 --> 15:25.430
Nobody's done that to the Flyer before.
No matter how much we got the first time,

15:25.571 --> 15:29.701
they'd figure the return was safe
and load it up with money.

15:29.775 --> 15:32.710
- Harvey thought of that?!
- Yes, sir. He did.

15:34.046 --> 15:37.607
Well, I'll tell you somethin'.
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

16:15.053 --> 16:17.351
- Stop it!
- Where?

16:17.890 --> 16:19.858
Up ahead there.

16:20.359 --> 16:23.055
Bet that's old Butch himself!

16:29.868 --> 16:31.961
Hold it there.

16:32.604 --> 16:36.563
- I just thought I'd watch.
- Bring the kids, why don't you?

16:36.675 --> 16:38.768
Stick your heads in.

16:39.311 --> 16:42.303
You'll get yourself blown up,
you don't open that door.

16:42.414 --> 16:47.181
I can't do that on account of I work for
EH Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad...

16:47.252 --> 16:50.221
Shut up about that EH Harriman stuff
and open the door!

16:50.289 --> 16:52.883
- What's goin' on?
- We got a patriot in there.

16:52.991 --> 16:56.984
- OK, go ahead, News.
- That's Woodcock. He's awful dedicated.

16:57.062 --> 16:59.121
- Woodcock!
- Yes, sir.

17:00.232 --> 17:01.824
You know who we are?

17:01.900 --> 17:05.233
You're the Hole in the Wall Gang,
Mr Cassidy. I understand.

17:05.304 --> 17:09.741
But you gotta understand Mr EH Harriman
himself of the Union Pacific give me this job.

17:09.840 --> 17:14.938
- I've gotta do my best, don't you see?
- That don't include gettin' yourself killed!

17:15.047 --> 17:18.346
- Dynamite's ready.
- Mr EH Harriman had the confidence...

17:18.450 --> 17:24.218
Open the door or that's it! Do you think EH
Harriman would get himself killed for you?

17:24.289 --> 17:25.915
Woodcock?

17:26.023 --> 17:31.326
I work for Mr EH Harriman of the Union
Pacific Railroad, and he entrusted me...

17:47.646 --> 17:50.479
Hey, Woodcock.
Hey, Woodcock, you all right?

17:50.549 --> 17:52.346
Hey.

17:58.724 --> 18:01.750
Whatever Harriman's payin' you ain't enough.

18:10.402 --> 18:13.667
There ain't what I'd call a fortune in there,
Butch.

18:13.739 --> 18:17.300
Well, just so we come out ahead.
That's the main thing.

18:18.677 --> 18:23.546
The Hole in the Wall Gang, I guess you heard,
robbed the Flyer outside our town,

18:23.615 --> 18:28.609
so that makes it our responsibility
to get out there and get after them.

18:28.720 --> 18:31.780
Now,
you're gonna have to bring your own horses.

18:31.923 --> 18:34.517
How many of you can bring your own guns?

18:38.130 --> 18:42.897
Yeah, well, how many of you are going
to want me to supply you with guns?

18:46.638 --> 18:51.200
Well... Come on, now. I think it's
up to us to do something, don't you?

18:51.309 --> 18:54.540
Why? They're probably halfway
to Hole in the Wall already.

18:54.613 --> 18:57.741
That's just exactly why we have got to hurry.

18:57.816 --> 19:02.014
If we get mounted up right now and
get after them, maybe we could head 'em off.

19:02.120 --> 19:05.180
Head 'em off? You crazy?
We did that, they'd kill us.

19:05.257 --> 19:09.990
Well, I don't think we want to lie down
and just let them get away with this...

19:12.164 --> 19:14.632
Boy, I just eat this up with a spoon!

19:15.367 --> 19:18.336
All right, you two. I want you at my party.

19:18.403 --> 19:21.531
- What party?
- I'm losing my piano player.

19:21.606 --> 19:23.836
He's going off to fight the war.

19:23.975 --> 19:26.409
- What war?
- The war with the Spanish.

19:26.478 --> 19:28.571
"Remember the Maine."

19:29.448 --> 19:33.680
- Who can forget it?
- I'm giving him a send-off, so come on.

19:42.294 --> 19:47.459
Goodbye, Dolly, I must leave you...

19:47.566 --> 19:51.297
When I was a kid, l always thought
I was gonna grow up to be a hero.

19:51.470 --> 19:56.407
- Well, it's too late now.
- What'd you say that for? You didn't have to.

19:56.475 --> 19:59.672
You want me to go, I'll go all alone

19:59.778 --> 20:04.044
and fight the Hole in the Wall Gang.
Hell, that's fine with me.

20:04.116 --> 20:08.712
And you want your kids to know that
you let me do that, that's fine with me!

20:09.054 --> 20:11.522
But I don't think that's what you want.

20:13.291 --> 20:15.725
Is it?

20:19.264 --> 20:22.392
Why don't we enlist? Go fight the Spanish.

20:22.467 --> 20:24.662
You and me in the war.

20:24.736 --> 20:29.105
We got a lot of things goin' for us.
Experience, maturity, leadership.

20:29.207 --> 20:31.334
I bet we end up officers.

20:31.443 --> 20:33.502
I'd be Major Parker.

20:34.813 --> 20:36.804
Parker?

20:36.882 --> 20:38.941
Yeah, that's my real name.

20:40.685 --> 20:43.279
- Robert LeRoy Parker.
- No foolin'?

20:43.955 --> 20:46.082
Yeah.

20:49.494 --> 20:51.894
- Mine's Longbaugh.
- No foolin'?

20:52.831 --> 20:56.426
- Long what?
- Harry Longbaugh.

20:56.501 --> 20:59.231
So you'd be Major Longbaugh.
Whaddaya say?

21:04.276 --> 21:07.643
You just keep thinkin', Butch.
That's what you're good at!

21:08.313 --> 21:14.548
But you're not frantic! No, sir! You have got
respect for me and I have got respect for you!

21:14.653 --> 21:19.147
That is why I'm your marshal! And that is
why you and you and you are riding with me!

21:19.257 --> 21:21.555
Am I right?

21:21.860 --> 21:24.192
Well? Whaddaya say?

21:24.729 --> 21:26.890
I say this:

21:26.965 --> 21:31.061
I say, ladies and gentlemen,

21:31.169 --> 21:33.933
boys and girls, friends and enemies,

21:34.005 --> 21:36.701
- meet the future!
- The future what?

21:36.775 --> 21:39.869
The future mode of transportation
for this western world.

21:40.212 --> 21:44.273
Now, I'm not gonna make a lot of
extravagant claims for this little machine.

21:44.349 --> 21:48.376
Sure, it'll change your whole life
for the better, but that's all!

21:48.486 --> 21:50.545
What do you think you're doin'?

21:50.622 --> 21:54.080
You got the crowd together.
Just thought I'd do a little selling.

21:54.192 --> 21:57.889
- I'm trying to raise a posse here!
- Got a short presentation.

21:57.963 --> 22:01.296
The horse is dead!
You'll see this item sells itself.

22:01.366 --> 22:04.597
Are you going to listen to him,
or come with me?

22:04.703 --> 22:08.036
Butch, Fanny says for you
to come in to her party, right now.

22:08.139 --> 22:14.169
Cheaper than a horse to keep.
No oats, no mess, no kicks, no runnin' away...

22:14.312 --> 22:16.143
Well,

22:17.015 --> 22:21.247
I think I'll get saddled up
and go lookin' for a woman.

22:22.520 --> 22:24.579
Good huntin'.

22:25.857 --> 22:28.553
Shouldn't take more than a couple of days.

22:33.131 --> 22:35.190
I'm not picky.

22:35.800 --> 22:38.928
As long as she's smart, pretty...

22:40.005 --> 22:42.064
and sweet.

22:42.674 --> 22:45.973
And gentle and... tender and...

22:46.945 --> 22:49.072
refined and

22:49.180 --> 22:52.377
lovely and... carefree...

24:00.885 --> 24:02.853
Keep goin', teacher lady.

24:10.528 --> 24:13.088
It's OK. Don't mind me. Keep on goin'.

24:40.759 --> 24:42.852
Let down your hair.

24:54.406 --> 24:56.931
Shake your head.

26:05.543 --> 26:07.477
- Know what I wish?
- What?

26:07.612 --> 26:10.080
That once you'd get here on time!

26:13.785 --> 26:16.447
You are mine, Etta Place.

26:16.554 --> 26:18.488
Mine!

26:18.590 --> 26:20.182
You hear me?

26:20.258 --> 26:23.557
Mine! All mine!

26:27.232 --> 26:30.360
Your soft, white flesh is mine.

26:30.435 --> 26:32.232
Soft.

26:32.303 --> 26:33.861
White.

26:42.881 --> 26:44.974
Meet the future!

26:45.617 --> 26:48.177
- Do you know what you're doin'?
- Theoretically.

26:48.987 --> 26:52.184
Don't ever hit your mother with a shovel

26:52.257 --> 26:55.124
It leaves a dull impression on her mind!

26:59.430 --> 27:02.922
Raindrops keep fallin' on myhead

27:03.434 --> 27:08.838
Andjustlike the guy
whose feetare too big forhis bed

27:08.907 --> 27:12.001
Nothin'seems to fit, those

27:12.076 --> 27:16.809
Raindrops are fallin' on myhead,

27:22.820 --> 27:28.122
Andlsaidl didn'tlike
the wayhe got things done

27:28.226 --> 27:31.457
Sleepin' on thejob, those

27:31.529 --> 27:36.330
Raindrops are fallin' on myhead,
theykeep fallin'

27:36.434 --> 27:41.872
But there's one thinglknow

27:41.940 --> 27:45.706
The blues theysend to meetme

27:45.843 --> 27:48.869

27:48.947 --> 27:56.046

28:00.124 --> 28:03.184
Raindrops keep fallin' on myhead

28:04.329 --> 28:09.790
But that doesn'tmean
my eyes willsoon be turnin'red

28:09.901 --> 28:13.132
Crying's notforme, cos

28:13.204 --> 28:17.368

28:18.109 --> 28:21.601
Because l'm free

28:22.480 --> 28:24.778
Nothing's worryin'me

29:36.487 --> 29:39.888
Raindrops are fallin' on myhead

29:40.858 --> 29:46.490
But that doesn'tmean
my eyes willsoon be turnin'red

29:46.597 --> 29:49.896
Crying's notforme, cos

29:50.034 --> 29:54.437
l'm nevergonna stop the rain by complainin'

29:55.173 --> 29:59.507
Because l'm free

29:59.877 --> 30:03.176
Nothing's worryin'

30:03.247 --> 30:06.239
Me

30:08.219 --> 30:11.279
You've come to get him for the Flyer?

30:11.389 --> 30:14.324
Can you believe I'm broke already?

30:14.425 --> 30:18.623
- Why is there never any money, Butch?
- Hell, I swear, Etta, I don't know.

30:18.696 --> 30:22.291
I've been workin' like a dog all my life
and I can't get a penny ahead.

30:22.400 --> 30:26.860
Sundance says it's cos you're a soft touch,
always taking expensive vacations,

30:26.938 --> 30:30.430
buying drinks for everyone,
and you're a rotten gambler.

30:30.508 --> 30:33.636
Well, that might have somethin' to do with it!

30:48.359 --> 30:50.452
Butch?

30:51.028 --> 30:54.862
D'you ever wonder if I'd met you first,
we'd been the ones to get involved?

30:54.932 --> 30:57.867
We are involved, Etta. Don't you know that?

30:59.837 --> 31:05.673
You're riding on my bicycle. In some Arabian
countries that's the same as being married.

31:09.881 --> 31:11.940
Hey.

31:12.683 --> 31:15.584
- What're you doin'?
- Stealin' your woman.

31:18.890 --> 31:21.188
Take her. Take her.

31:22.894 --> 31:25.795
You're a romantic bastard. I'll give you that.

31:35.673 --> 31:40.269
- OK, open up in there.
- I work for Mr EH Harriman of the Union...

31:40.344 --> 31:42.869
- Hey, Woodcock!
- Butch?

31:42.947 --> 31:46.383
- You OK?
- Well, sort of.

31:46.484 --> 31:49.578
Hey, that's wonderful. Let's take a look at ya.

31:51.322 --> 31:57.283
Now, Butch, you gotta have more respect for
me than to think I'd fall for a stunt like that.

32:00.765 --> 32:05.600
- You can't wanna get blown up again?
- Butch, you know that if it were my money,

32:05.703 --> 32:09.002
there is nobody that I would
rather have steal it than you.

32:09.106 --> 32:14.305
But I am still in the employ of Mr
EH Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad.

32:14.378 --> 32:16.642
- Start this train!
- Get back inside, lady.

32:16.747 --> 32:20.410
Oh, I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of anything.

32:20.518 --> 32:23.783
I'm a grandmother and a female,
and I've got my rights.

32:23.855 --> 32:27.621
- We've got no time for this.
- You can bull all the others, but not me!

32:27.725 --> 32:31.525
I've fought whiskey and gamblin'!
I can certainly fight you!

32:31.596 --> 32:33.154
We got no time for this!

32:33.464 --> 32:35.932
- Put down the gun, Sundance.
- Let go!

32:36.000 --> 32:39.367
- What you gonna do to her?
- Whatever you force me to.

32:39.437 --> 32:43.271
Leave her alone. You're after the money,
and the money's in here.

32:43.374 --> 32:47.743
All I want is for somebody to start this train.
Somebody! Please!

32:47.812 --> 32:52.875
- Open up or tell her goodbye!
- Our Father, who art in heaven,

32:52.984 --> 32:55.350
hallowed be thy name.

32:55.419 --> 32:59.014
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,

32:59.090 --> 33:01.786
on earth, as it is in heaven.

33:01.859 --> 33:04.794
What am I gonna tell poor Mr Harriman?

33:07.999 --> 33:11.230
Woodcock,
what d'you have to do somethin' like that for?

33:11.369 --> 33:15.669
Well, Butch, you blew the last one so easy
I just had to do something.

33:15.773 --> 33:17.832
Give me that, and get some more.

33:19.710 --> 33:21.405
A lot more!

33:22.713 --> 33:24.613
Well, that oughta do it.

33:45.469 --> 33:48.734
Think you used enough dynamite there,
Butch?

34:43.194 --> 34:44.922
What the hell is that?

35:07.952 --> 35:11.513
Whatever they're sellin', I don't want it.

35:20.131 --> 35:22.429
Will you leave it!

35:28.105 --> 35:30.164
Come on!

35:48.459 --> 35:50.393
- Hey, Butch.
- What?

35:50.461 --> 35:52.156
They're very good.

35:54.765 --> 35:56.824
Split up!

36:09.847 --> 36:12.281
- How many of 'em are followin' us?
- All of them.

36:12.383 --> 36:16.752
All of 'em?
What's the matter with those guys?!

37:46.277 --> 37:49.542
I think we lost 'em. D'you think we lost 'em?

37:50.281 --> 37:52.909
- No.
- Neither do I.

38:10.234 --> 38:12.998
Take our horses and keep 'em out of sight.

38:13.103 --> 38:15.970
- Where's Sweetface?
- Just inside. Trouble?

38:17.541 --> 38:22.001
Listen, you dirty old man, I know you're
a lyin' thief, but who'd know it to look at ya?

38:22.112 --> 38:25.548
Get out front fast. You seen us
ride through town five minutes ago.

38:25.616 --> 38:28.813
You do this right,
I'll get you an old dog to kick.

38:29.553 --> 38:32.078
Here, room nine. The top of the stairs.

38:43.334 --> 38:46.030
My beloved's proud

38:47.037 --> 38:50.905
Hey, you're drivin' me crazy
starin' out the window like that.

38:50.975 --> 38:53.603
I swear to you Sweetface can handle it easy.

38:53.711 --> 38:57.238
He wouldn't dare louse me up,
he's that scared of me.

39:03.387 --> 39:09.019
How can I give Agnes the concentration she
deserves with you lookin' out the window?

39:09.126 --> 39:12.220
Butch, you're really somethin',
you know that?

39:14.465 --> 39:18.424
Could you be a bit more specific, Agnes?

39:18.535 --> 39:20.594
Butch!

39:26.043 --> 39:28.637
OK, Sweetface, give 'em a nice smile.

39:29.446 --> 39:31.539
Come on.

39:32.683 --> 39:34.378
Oh, that's a nice touch.

39:34.451 --> 39:39.684
You know, I swear, if he told me I rode
out of town ten minutes ago, I'd believe him.

39:41.992 --> 39:44.051
And there they go.

39:52.169 --> 39:55.263
No, no, no. Don't ask me to stay.

40:03.480 --> 40:07.246
You're the only real man I ever met.
You know that, Butch?

40:08.185 --> 40:12.451
It's not just cos of all that money
you got to spend on people.

40:12.523 --> 40:16.721
It's you. The way you're always
lookin' to see am I happy or not.

40:17.494 --> 40:20.793
A lot of the other girls,
they might want you just for

40:20.864 --> 40:23.856
when you got lots of money
to spend on people.

40:23.934 --> 40:25.697
Me, I...

40:25.803 --> 40:33.676
I don't care about clothes
and money and jewels and furs.

40:35.646 --> 40:41.084
Things like that.
Lots of the other girls do, but I never did.

40:41.151 --> 40:43.244
I aIways said "Agnes..."

41:01.872 --> 41:03.840
Don't move!

41:04.174 --> 41:06.472
Stand up. Put your hands up.

41:07.444 --> 41:09.309
Higher!

41:10.848 --> 41:12.907
Now turn around and...

41:17.688 --> 41:20.316
Get our horses and come on back here.

41:28.332 --> 41:31.392
Get outta here. Get outta here.

41:31.568 --> 41:33.661
Get out!

41:36.140 --> 41:39.701
Go on! Get outta here, you fatheaded beast!

41:41.345 --> 41:44.906
- Come on!
- You're the fatheaded beast. Quit shouting.

41:46.083 --> 41:48.574
Boy, somebody sure trained 'em.

42:17.381 --> 42:18.905
Which way?

42:18.982 --> 42:22.975
It doesn't matter. I don't know
where we've been and I've just been there.

42:23.053 --> 42:25.613
They can't follow us. We're safe.

42:25.923 --> 42:27.857
You really think so?

42:27.958 --> 42:30.449
I will if you will.

42:58.822 --> 43:01.757
How long you figure we been watchin'?

43:02.392 --> 43:04.451
Oh, a while.

43:17.174 --> 43:20.371
How long before
you figure they're not after us?

43:20.444 --> 43:22.503
A while longer.

43:24.915 --> 43:27.440
How come you're so talkative?

43:28.886 --> 43:31.411
Just naturally blabby, I guess.

43:35.425 --> 43:38.121
I haven't done so much ridin'
since I quit rustlin'.

43:38.228 --> 43:43.029
That's a miserable occupation.
Dusk to dawn, no sleep, rotten food.

43:47.271 --> 43:49.136
Hey?

43:49.907 --> 43:52.000
I see it.

43:55.712 --> 43:58.010
Torches, you think?

43:58.081 --> 44:00.242
Maybe. Maybe lanterns.

44:01.919 --> 44:04.012
They're followin' our path.

44:05.322 --> 44:07.552
Dead on it.

44:07.658 --> 44:11.651
I couldn't do that. Could you do that?
How can theydo that?!

44:13.297 --> 44:15.424
Who are those guys?

44:27.077 --> 44:29.443
- Sure it'll work?
- It'll work.

44:29.513 --> 44:33.279
- That's what you said about Sweetface!
- This'll work.

44:58.141 --> 45:02.202
Once they divide up, we take 'em.
No trouble. Right?

45:02.746 --> 45:04.680
Maybe.

45:04.748 --> 45:08.115
Boy, for a gunman,
you're one hell of a pessimist.

45:09.353 --> 45:12.550
They ought to get to
where we split up anytime.

45:14.925 --> 45:17.393
They're just about there.

45:20.197 --> 45:22.927
How many of 'em you think'll come our way?

45:24.201 --> 45:27.329
I wish we had rifles. I mean, they got rifles.

45:27.404 --> 45:30.134
But we got surprise on our side, right?

45:35.946 --> 45:39.040
Well, so far they're doin' what we want.

45:42.786 --> 45:45.721
You think we ought to take 'em from up here?

45:50.961 --> 45:53.555
Kid... look,
you know this work better than I do.

45:53.630 --> 45:57.828
Is it best here or maybe down there,
closer to the trail?

46:03.874 --> 46:05.967
Dammit!

46:07.878 --> 46:10.142
They're not goin' for it.

46:12.883 --> 46:15.181
Who are those guys?

46:15.852 --> 46:17.945
I don't know.

46:18.555 --> 46:21.251
- I don't know!
- We gotta do somethin' and shake 'em.

46:21.358 --> 46:27.160
Whatever it is that you come up with is fine
with me. But whatever it is, it better be now!

46:38.675 --> 46:40.108
- Ray...
- What're you doin'?

46:40.210 --> 46:43.873
- Hold on. Easy, Ray.
- What the hell do you mean, take it easy?!

46:43.980 --> 46:47.677
- You said you'd never come to my territory.
- We haven't, Ray. We haven't!

46:47.784 --> 46:50.810
Just cos we were friendly
doesn't allow you to break in.

46:50.887 --> 46:53.822
What would happen to me
ifwe was to be seen together?

46:53.890 --> 46:56.381
I'm too old to hunt up anotherjob!

46:57.794 --> 47:00.194
You could at least have drawn your guns!

47:00.263 --> 47:03.027
Listen to Butch.
He's tryin' to tell you somethin'.

47:03.100 --> 47:05.295
All right. What do you want?

47:05.402 --> 47:08.667
A couple of things. We wanna enlist, Ray.

47:08.739 --> 47:12.505
You know, in the army.
Right away! Go fight the Spanish.

47:17.647 --> 47:20.275
Oh, you're crazy. You are crazy.

47:21.151 --> 47:23.881
You are both of you crazy!

47:23.954 --> 47:27.287
They'd throw you in jail
for a thousand years each!

47:32.329 --> 47:35.264
Come on, Sundance. Start trussin' my feet.

47:38.101 --> 47:42.765
Here, you've seen these before. Come on! I'm
not gonna take the chance someone saw you.

47:42.873 --> 47:44.932
Ray, we're serious about this.

47:45.041 --> 47:47.566
- You are known outlaws.
- We quit.

47:47.677 --> 47:50.168
- Quit!
- That's the point, we would. Too tight?

47:50.280 --> 47:54.376
No, that's all right. There's hankies
in the top drawer you can use to gag me.

47:54.484 --> 47:57.248
Oh, this'd work. This'd work, Ray.

47:57.320 --> 48:02.280
You trust us and the government trusts you,
so anything you tell 'em, they gotta believe it.

48:02.359 --> 48:06.921
You've never done a dishonest thing in your
life and what are you, pushin' 60? We'd quit.

48:06.997 --> 48:10.160
They'd drop all the charges.
We'd fight till the war is over.

48:10.267 --> 48:14.601
- They don't even have to make us officers.
- That's some proposition.

48:14.704 --> 48:18.538
I mean, theyforget all about
the years of thievin' and robbin'?

48:18.608 --> 48:23.136
They take you into the army,
which is what you want in the first place.

48:25.182 --> 48:28.618
There's somethin' out there that scares you,
huh?

48:30.086 --> 48:35.547
It's too late. Shoulda let yourselves get killed
a long time ago while you had the chance.

48:35.625 --> 48:41.962
See, you may be the biggest thing ever hit
this area, but you're still two-bit outlaws!

48:42.032 --> 48:45.559
I never met a soul more affable than you,
or faster than the Kid,

48:45.635 --> 48:51.596
but you're still nothin' but two-bit outlaws
on the dodge. It's over! Don't you get that?

48:51.708 --> 48:58.011
Your times is over and you're gonna die
bloody! And all you can do is choose where.

48:58.849 --> 49:01.545
I'm sorry. I'm gettin' mean in my old age.

49:02.219 --> 49:04.312
Come on! Shut me up, Sundance.

51:24.815 --> 51:26.715
Ah, you're wastin' your time.

51:27.017 --> 51:30.783
- They can't track us over rock.
- Tell them that.

51:57.181 --> 51:59.649
They're beginnin' to get on my nerves.

52:01.251 --> 52:03.344
Who are those guys?

52:05.322 --> 52:10.225
You remember the time you and me and Etta
went to Denver that summer for a vacation?

52:10.327 --> 52:14.320
Glad you brought that up.
An important topic, considerin' our situation.

52:14.398 --> 52:17.925
- The night we went gamblin'. Remember?
- We had dinner at the hotel.

52:18.001 --> 52:23.667
Etta had roast beef and I had chicken. If I can
remember what you had, I'll die a happy man!

52:24.375 --> 52:26.434
- Look out there.
- What?

52:27.745 --> 52:31.875
We got to talkin' to some gambler that night
and he told us about an Indian.

52:31.982 --> 52:37.079
A full-blooded Indian, except he called
himselfwith an English name. Sir somebody.

52:37.187 --> 52:40.816
- Lord Baltimore?
- That's right. And he could track anybody.

52:40.891 --> 52:43.359
Over anything, day or night.

52:43.427 --> 52:45.292
So?

52:46.196 --> 52:48.426
The guy on the ground, I think it's him.

52:53.837 --> 52:57.432
No, Baltimore works out of Oklahoma.
He's strictly an Oklahoma man.

52:57.508 --> 53:01.467
I don't know where we are,
but it sure as hell isn't Oklahoma.

53:01.578 --> 53:03.637
Aw, it couldn't be him.

53:08.685 --> 53:10.778
It couldn't be him.

53:11.822 --> 53:13.881
I guess.

53:15.626 --> 53:18.459
Whoever it is, it sure the hell is somebody.

53:49.760 --> 53:53.423
Dammit! Don't they get tired?
Don't they get hungry?

53:54.431 --> 53:57.161
- They gotta be.
- Why don't they slow up?

53:57.267 --> 54:01.931
Hell, they could go faster. At least that'd be
a change. They don't even break formation.

54:02.039 --> 54:04.098
Do something!

54:38.876 --> 54:41.344
- Kid?
- What?

54:42.479 --> 54:44.743
Who's the best lawman?

54:45.883 --> 54:49.944
Best? How?
You mean toughest, or easiest to bribe?

54:50.587 --> 54:52.282
Toughest.

54:53.624 --> 54:55.285
Joe Lefors.

54:56.126 --> 54:58.185
Gotta be.

55:01.698 --> 55:05.134
Lefors never leaves Wyoming. Never.
You know that.

55:06.203 --> 55:08.501
He always wears a white skimmer.

55:08.572 --> 55:12.770
That's how you tell it's Joe Lefors
cos he wears a white straw hat.

55:14.611 --> 55:16.704
Look at that guy out front.

55:36.433 --> 55:38.628
Jeez, who are those guys?

55:44.207 --> 55:46.175
Come on!

55:46.243 --> 55:48.336
On your feet, you dumbhead.

56:32.089 --> 56:34.649
Go on! Get outta here! Go on!

56:36.126 --> 56:38.117
What if they don't follow the horse?

56:38.228 --> 56:41.789
You're the brains, Butch.
You'll think of somethin'.

58:09.186 --> 58:11.279
Dammit!

58:24.735 --> 58:27.568
The way I figure it, we can either fight or give.

58:27.637 --> 58:31.004
- Ifwe give, we go to jail.
- I've been there already.

58:31.908 --> 58:35.901
But ifwe fight, they can stay
right where they are and starve us out.

58:35.979 --> 58:40.416
Or go for position, shoot us. Might even
get a rock slide started and get us that way.

58:40.517 --> 58:42.508
What else can they do?

58:42.586 --> 58:45.384
They could surrender,
but I wouldn't count on that.

58:46.590 --> 58:49.320
They're goin' for position all right.

58:50.260 --> 58:52.558
Better get ready.

58:54.931 --> 58:59.925
Kid, the next time I say let's go someplace
like Bolivia, let's go someplace like Bolivia.

59:00.003 --> 59:01.436
Next time...

59:03.440 --> 59:05.340
Ready?

59:06.676 --> 59:08.769
No, we'll jump.

59:13.150 --> 59:16.381
- Like hell we will.
- No, it'll be OK,

59:16.453 --> 59:19.547
ifwe're not squished to death.
They'll never follow us.

59:19.623 --> 59:23.184
- How do you know?
- Would you jump if you didn't have to?

59:23.260 --> 59:27.162
- I have to and I'm not gonna.
- Well, we got to, otherwise we're dead.

59:27.230 --> 59:29.892
They'll just have to go back
the same way they come.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.400
- Just one clear shot.
- Come on.

59:32.469 --> 59:34.164
- We got to!
- Get away from me.

59:34.237 --> 59:36.034
- Why?
- I wanna fight 'em!

59:36.106 --> 59:37.573
- They'll kill us!
- Maybe.

59:37.641 --> 59:40.166
- You wanna die?
- Do you?

59:41.044 --> 59:43.706
All right. I'll jump first.

59:43.814 --> 59:45.679
- No.
- Then you jump first.

59:45.782 --> 59:47.511
- No, I said.
- What's the matter?

59:47.717 --> 59:49.810
I can't swim!

59:59.496 --> 01:00:03.057
Why, are you crazy?
The fall will probably kill ya!

01:00:26.423 --> 01:00:29.722
- You're drownin' me!
- I can't help it! I can't swim!

01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:33.728
- Kid, I'll kill ya! You're choking me!
- I can't swim!

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:37.027
I'm tellin' you, if I drown, I swear I'll kill you!

01:00:37.267 --> 01:00:40.498
Never said I was a great swimmer.

01:00:45.242 --> 01:00:48.939
You're choking me! You're choking me!

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:51.672
You don't have to choke me!

01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:55.142
Kid, let go of my throat!

01:01:22.946 --> 01:01:25.574
The papers said they had you.

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:31.111
- Was it Lefors? Did they say?
- Joe Lefors? I think so.

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:33.815
- And their tracker?
- Tracker?

01:01:33.924 --> 01:01:37.792
- Was it Lord Baltimore?
- I think so. The paper's inside.

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:47.367
You got enough to feed us?

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:49.530
Don't you know I do?

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.206
- They said you were dead.
- Don't make a big thing out of it.

01:01:57.514 --> 01:01:59.778
No, make a big thing out of it.

01:02:05.021 --> 01:02:06.921
Hey!

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:10.215
It was Baltimore and Lefors.

01:02:15.966 --> 01:02:17.831
What?

01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:20.798
- You know who else?
- Who?

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:23.202
- Jeff Car, George Hiatt.
- Hiatt?

01:02:23.273 --> 01:02:25.366
TT Kelliher.

01:02:28.878 --> 01:02:32.473
Jeez, we lucked out getting away.
You know that?

01:02:34.818 --> 01:02:38.379
But why would these guys join up
and take after us, though?

01:02:38.455 --> 01:02:41.390
Forget it.
A bunch like that won't stay together long.

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:45.155
- They will, if Mr Harriman has his way.
- Who?

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:50.494
EH Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad.
He resents the way you've picked on him,

01:02:50.633 --> 01:02:54.228
so he's outfitted a special train
and hired special employees.

01:02:54.838 --> 01:02:57.398
You've spent the last two days
avoiding them.

01:02:57.474 --> 01:03:01.570
It's really sort of flattering,
if you wanna think about it that way.

01:03:01.644 --> 01:03:06.513
- A setup like that costs more than we took.
- Apparently he can afford it.

01:03:09.052 --> 01:03:11.111
That crazy Harriman.

01:03:13.223 --> 01:03:15.088
That's bad business!

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:20.390
How long d'you think I'd stay in operation
if every time I pulled ajob it cost me money?

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:25.730
If he'd pay me what he's spendin' to make me
stop robbin' him, I'd stop robbin' him!

01:03:28.238 --> 01:03:31.105
You probably inherited every penny you got!

01:03:31.841 --> 01:03:36.005
- Inherited guys. What the hell do they know?
- You say they're hired permanent?

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:39.110
No. Just till they kill you.

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:52.021
That means they're still after us, Butch.

01:03:52.095 --> 01:03:55.326
And it's gonna be
the same thing all over again.

01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:03.130
They'll show up here, sooner or later.

01:04:20.123 --> 01:04:22.182
Hey, Etta.

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:24.089
I'll get you some more.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:27.891
Butch and me have been talkin' it all over.

01:04:27.964 --> 01:04:31.525
Wherever the hell Bolivia is,
that's where we're off to.

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:36.595
Yeah, we'll go down there and play it safe.
Maybe keep our hand in a little bit.

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:41.202
- Butch speaks some Spanish.
- I can wrestle with a menu OK.

01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:43.404
And you speak it good.

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:47.305
It'd be good cover goin' with a woman.

01:04:48.318 --> 01:04:50.411
No one expects it.

01:04:51.688 --> 01:04:53.747
We could travel safer.

01:04:56.493 --> 01:04:59.929
What I'm sayin' is if you wanna go,
I won't stop you.

01:04:59.996 --> 01:05:03.193
But the minute you start
to whine or make a nuisance,

01:05:03.299 --> 01:05:07.030
I don't care where we are,
I'm dumpin' you flat.

01:05:07.137 --> 01:05:10.903
Don't sugarcoat it like that, Kid.
Tell her straight.

01:05:15.778 --> 01:05:21.375
I'm 26 and I'm single and a schoolteacher,
and that's the bottom of the pit.

01:05:21.518 --> 01:05:25.181
And the only excitement I've known
is here with me now.

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:31.788
So I'll go with you and I won't whine, and
I'll sew your socks and stitch your wounds,

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:35.388
and I'll do anything you ask of me,
except one thing.

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:38.760
I won't watch you die.

01:05:38.835 --> 01:05:41.565
I'll miss that scene, if you don't mind.

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:18.469
The future's all yours, ya lousy bicycles!

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:26.304
Well, you know, it could be worse.

01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:30.915
You get a lot more for your money in Bolivia.
I checked on it.

01:11:30.987 --> 01:11:35.117
What could they have here
that you could possibly wanna buy?

01:11:40.763 --> 01:11:42.993
Jeez, all Bolivia can't look like this.

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:47.592
How do you know? This might be
the garden spot of the whole country.

01:11:48.838 --> 01:11:54.538
People may travel hundreds of miles just
to get to this spot where we're standing now.

01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:57.773
This might be the Atlantic City,
New Jersey of all Bolivia.

01:11:57.847 --> 01:12:03.615
I know a lot more about Bolivia than you
know about Atlantic City, I can tell you that.

01:12:04.554 --> 01:12:06.613
You do, huh?

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:09.388
I was born there.

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:11.551
I was born in New Jersey.

01:12:12.261 --> 01:12:15.753
- Brought up there. So...
- You're from the East. I didn't know.

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:18.925
The total tonnage ofwhat
you don't know is enough to...

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:22.835
- I'm not sure we're accomplishing anything.
- Listen!

01:12:22.972 --> 01:12:27.272
Yourjob is to back me up,
because you'd starve without me.

01:12:28.044 --> 01:12:30.569
And, you, yourjob is to shut up!

01:12:34.984 --> 01:12:39.284
Well, he'll feel a lot better
after he's robbed a couple of banks.

01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:45.986
Bolivia!

01:12:55.638 --> 01:13:01.440
Hell, it's just a bank like any other bank.
Gotta move in slowly, check out everything.

01:13:02.678 --> 01:13:07.081
- The thing to remember...
- Don't tell me how to rob a bank! I know how!

01:13:07.783 --> 01:13:13.187
Boy, a few dark clouds appear on your
horizon, you just go all to pieces, don't you?

01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:39.409
Buenos días, señores. ¿Les puedo servir
en algo? Ordenen, porfavor, inmediatamente.

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:43.109
¿Quieren haceralgún depósito?

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:50.620
Si quieren abriralguna cuenta, vean al cajero.
lnmediatamente los atendemos.

01:13:57.066 --> 01:13:58.931
¿Señor?

01:14:09.912 --> 01:14:12.005
Adiós.

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:14.112
This is a robbery.

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:16.515
Esto es un robo.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.579
Esto es un robo.

01:14:25.761 --> 01:14:27.752
This is a unison recitation.

01:14:27.863 --> 01:14:30.957
I'm not doing this.
He claimed he knew the damn language!

01:14:31.067 --> 01:14:36.095
We've been over this before. Your line
ofwork requires a specialized vocabulary.

01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:39.972
- I got nervous. I forgot the words. Shoot me!
- You've had worse ideas lately!

01:14:40.276 --> 01:14:42.335
Raise your hands.

01:14:44.714 --> 01:14:46.204
Las manos arriba.

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:48.408
Raise them.

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:51.286
Arriba.

01:14:51.353 --> 01:14:53.548
All of you, back against the wall.

01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:56.149
Todos ustedes,

01:14:56.926 --> 01:15:00.089
and then... "arrísmense" a la pared.

01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:03.924
Give me the money.

01:15:09.138 --> 01:15:11.368
Give me the money.

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:14.100
Give me the money.

01:15:15.544 --> 01:15:19.241
This is not going to work and we'll be up
all night until you get this.

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:21.441
Now, give me the money.

01:15:26.055 --> 01:15:28.990
It's on the tip of my tongue, Etta. I swear it.

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:34.652
Butch, are you still thinking in there?

01:15:34.764 --> 01:15:36.732
What the hell else is there to do?

01:15:37.399 --> 01:15:39.367
Try this one.

01:15:39.435 --> 01:15:41.801
Where is the safe? Open it.

01:15:42.438 --> 01:15:44.565
¿Dónde es...?

01:15:48.677 --> 01:15:50.770
That's a hard one.

01:15:52.982 --> 01:15:55.348
¿Dónde está la caja? ¡Ábrala!

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:58.185
That's very good, Butch.

01:15:59.188 --> 01:16:01.247
You're a good teacher, Etta.

01:16:02.258 --> 01:16:04.658
- ¡Esto es un robo!
- ¿Un robo?

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:12.097
Manos a...

01:16:12.601 --> 01:16:15.069
Manos...

01:16:22.011 --> 01:16:24.707
- ¡Manos arriba!
- They got 'em up! Skip on down.

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:26.381
- ¡Arriba!
- Skip on down!

01:16:26.448 --> 01:16:32.045
- Todos ustedes "arrísmense" a la pared.
- They're against the wall already!

01:16:32.655 --> 01:16:35.783
Dónde...
Ah, you're so damn smart, you read it!

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:49.832
- Lot of good you did.
- You didn't help.

01:16:49.905 --> 01:16:52.430
You ain't any good without a crib sheet.

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:01.675
¡Bandidos!

01:17:09.158 --> 01:17:12.685
- For God's sake, don't drop the money!
- I won't!

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:15.457
- Voya traeral comisario.
- ¡Sí, vamos!

01:17:15.531 --> 01:17:17.431
- ¿Su nombre?
- Evaristo.

01:17:17.499 --> 01:17:19.126
¿Evaristo qué?

01:17:19.235 --> 01:17:22.068
Comandante,
dos hombres acaban de asaltar elbanco.

01:17:22.137 --> 01:17:25.436
- ¿Quiénes eran?
- Dos yanquis y una muchacha.

01:17:25.507 --> 01:17:27.941
Se llevaron todo el dinero ymipistola.

01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:30.944
¡Vamonos! Vengan ustedes, ¡a los caballos!

01:18:23.198 --> 01:18:24.893
Isn't that a pretty sight?

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:32.132
We're back in business,
boys and girls, just like the old days.

01:22:59.374 --> 01:23:01.239
- Jose!
- Sí, señor.

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:03.505
We should stay, get him and be done with it.

01:23:03.612 --> 01:23:07.639
Yeah, but what ifwe lose? We saw him
with two guys, but what if he's got 20?

01:23:07.716 --> 01:23:11.413
- You don't know for sure it's Lefors.
- I'm a hell of a guesser.

01:23:11.486 --> 01:23:14.922
He can't arrest you here.
It's a foreign country. Or take you back.

01:23:15.023 --> 01:23:18.254
He's not gonna take anybody back.
He wants to finish us here.

01:23:18.327 --> 01:23:21.319
He'll wait for us to pull ajob,
then hunt us like before.

01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:27.062
And if he misses us, he'll wait for the next
job. Let's finish it now, one way or the other.

01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:31.528
He's gotta wait for us, right?
To pull anotherjob?

01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:35.007
Well, what if there isn't anotherjob?

01:23:35.077 --> 01:23:38.740
I mean, he can't arrest us
and he can't take us outta here.

01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:43.216
We'll drive him crazy.
We'll outlast the bastard. We'll go straight!

01:23:43.318 --> 01:23:45.411
So you want jobs?

01:23:46.321 --> 01:23:51.691
You're from the US ofA
and you are seeking after employment.

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:57.699
Well, you couldn't have picked a more out of
the way place in all Bolivia, I'll tell you that.

01:23:58.734 --> 01:24:00.827
Gracias, Jesús.

01:24:00.902 --> 01:24:07.273
Ordinarily, you've got to wait to work
for Percy Garris, but this ain't ordinarily.

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:08.741
Bingo.

01:24:08.844 --> 01:24:13.338
- You mean there are jobs?
- Yes, there are jobs. There are lots of jobs.

01:24:13.448 --> 01:24:15.643
Don't you wanna know why?

01:24:15.717 --> 01:24:17.776
Yeah. Why?

01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:19.513
Dammy.

01:24:19.588 --> 01:24:22.716
Because I cannot promise to pay you.

01:24:23.492 --> 01:24:25.960
Don't you wanna know why?

01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:28.120
OK. Why?

01:24:29.531 --> 01:24:33.968
On account of the payroll thieves,
fellow citizens.

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:39.063
You see, every mine around
gets its payroll from La Paz.

01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:43.268
And every mine around
gets its payroll held up.

01:24:44.313 --> 01:24:47.874
Some say it's the Bolivian bandits and...

01:24:48.784 --> 01:24:53.278
some say that it's the "Bandidos Yanquis."

01:24:53.789 --> 01:24:55.882
Could I see that?

01:25:00.829 --> 01:25:04.560
Fairly nice-looking piece.
Can you hit anything?

01:25:05.434 --> 01:25:07.527
Sometimes.

01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:18.170
Hit that.

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:28.154
No, no, son. No, son.
I just wanna know can you shoot.

01:25:28.223 --> 01:25:30.316
Put your piece in your hand...

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.619
and shoot.

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:46.740
Dammy.

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:48.776
Can I move?

01:25:48.844 --> 01:25:51.745
Move? What the hell you mean move?

01:25:57.219 --> 01:25:59.744
- I'm better when I move.
- Yeah.

01:26:01.022 --> 01:26:06.824
Well, considering that I'm desperate
and you are just what I'm looking for,

01:26:06.895 --> 01:26:11.457
on top ofwhich you stem from the US ofA,
we start tomorrow morning.

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:14.068
- You mean we got jobs?
- Payroll guard.

01:26:14.703 --> 01:26:16.170
Dammy.

01:26:16.238 --> 01:26:17.899
¡Vámonos a trabajar!

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:20.236
Hey, Chusto! Chusto!

01:26:20.308 --> 01:26:25.041
Oh, don't you remember
sweet Betsy from Pike?

01:26:25.113 --> 01:26:29.482
Crossed the high mountains
with her lover, lke

01:26:29.618 --> 01:26:33.577
Two yoke of oxen and a big yeller dog

01:26:33.655 --> 01:26:37.318
A tall Shanghai rooster and one spotted hog

01:26:37.426 --> 01:26:41.658
Toodle-dang hoodie aye-doh,
toodle-dang hoodie ay

01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:46.030
Toodle-dang hoodie aye-doh,
toodle-dang hoodie ay

01:26:46.101 --> 01:26:49.867
The Shanghai ran off and the cattle all died

01:26:49.938 --> 01:26:52.031
Last piece of bacon that morning...

01:26:52.107 --> 01:26:54.439
I think they're in the trees up ahead.

01:26:54.509 --> 01:26:57.672
- In the bushes on the left.
- They're in the trees up ahead!

01:26:57.746 --> 01:27:00.715
You take the trees, I'll take the bushes.

01:27:00.816 --> 01:27:03.808
Will you two beginners cut it out!

01:27:04.252 --> 01:27:07.813
Well, we're just trying to spot an ambush,
Mr Garris.

01:27:07.889 --> 01:27:09.686
Morons.

01:27:09.758 --> 01:27:12.659
I've got morons on my team.

01:27:12.727 --> 01:27:16.356
Nobody is going to rob us
going down the mountain!

01:27:16.465 --> 01:27:19.434
We have got no money
going down the mountain!

01:27:19.501 --> 01:27:23.938
When we have got the money,
on the way back,

01:27:24.172 --> 01:27:26.265
then you can sweat.

01:27:26.708 --> 01:27:28.767
Bingo.

01:27:53.969 --> 01:27:56.460
We hit this place in June, didn't we?

01:28:09.184 --> 01:28:11.084
Jones!

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:13.554
Give me a hand over here.

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:15.749
Who am I? Smith or Jones?

01:28:16.358 --> 01:28:18.326
Live!

01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:38.307
'Bout a half-hour more
and we can start to worry.

01:28:39.114 --> 01:28:43.517
As soon as we get to the pass up there.
We'll be all right till then.

01:28:44.819 --> 01:28:48.812
- They might try somethin' here.
- Nah. Better cover up there.

01:28:50.725 --> 01:28:55.719
You got to relax, you fellas.
You got to get used to Bolivian ways.

01:28:56.031 --> 01:28:58.431
You got to go easy. Dammy!

01:28:58.967 --> 01:29:00.195
Like I do.

01:29:00.268 --> 01:29:04.568
Course,
you probably think I'm crazy, but I'm not.

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:07.833
Bingo. I'm colorful.

01:29:08.577 --> 01:29:13.446
That's what happens when you live
ten years alone in Bolivia. You get colorful.

01:29:33.668 --> 01:29:35.568
Where are they?

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:39.666
I can't see 'em.

01:29:54.022 --> 01:29:55.649
Let's get outta here!

01:31:29.417 --> 01:31:32.477
Tell them to leave the money and go.

01:31:33.555 --> 01:31:37.787
Dejen el "dinoro"... dinero and...

01:31:38.426 --> 01:31:40.121
y váyanse.

01:31:41.996 --> 01:31:44.692
¿Que dejemos el dinero ynos vayamos?

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:49.736
Tell them we were hired to take it back.
It's our job!

01:31:50.205 --> 01:31:52.298
Tell them the money isn't ours.

01:31:53.942 --> 01:31:56.968
El dinero... no es nuestro.

01:31:57.579 --> 01:32:00.980
No, ya no es de ustedes.
Ahora es de nosotros.

01:32:01.116 --> 01:32:02.947
¡Claro!

01:32:04.819 --> 01:32:09.916
We'll try telling them again.
It's our job. The money isn't ours.

01:32:11.659 --> 01:32:14.423
El dinero no es nuestro.

01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:18.861
- Lo necesitamos.
- También nosotros lo necesitamos.

01:32:20.935 --> 01:32:23.199
- What do you think?
- Not so good.

01:32:23.772 --> 01:32:26.206
Can you take the two on the right?

01:32:27.208 --> 01:32:32.236
Kid, there's somethin' I think I oughta tell ya.
I never shot anybody before.

01:32:35.683 --> 01:32:38.379
One hell of a time to tell me.

01:32:39.053 --> 01:32:43.990
Vale más que se hagan a un lado,
porque a lo mejor éstos nos matan.

01:32:44.759 --> 01:32:50.561
Try for the two on the right. Aim dead center.
That way if you miss, you still hit something.

01:32:50.799 --> 01:32:52.460
- Go!
- ¿Qué?

01:32:52.767 --> 01:32:54.997
- Please!
- ¿Qué?

01:32:55.303 --> 01:32:57.100
- Porfavor.
- ¡Porfavor!

01:33:46.955 --> 01:33:49.048
Well, we've gone straight.

01:33:52.026 --> 01:33:53.687
What'll we try now.

01:34:11.179 --> 01:34:14.876
There are other ways of going straight,
you know.

01:34:28.696 --> 01:34:31.290
There are other ways of going straight.

01:34:34.369 --> 01:34:36.462
There's farming.

01:34:39.007 --> 01:34:41.100
We could buy a place.

01:34:42.210 --> 01:34:44.303
I don't know how to farm.

01:34:48.116 --> 01:34:50.175
What about a ranch, then?

01:34:52.487 --> 01:34:57.424
The last time we tried a ranch
was during our rustlin' days.

01:34:57.525 --> 01:35:02.121
And even then we weren't much good at it.
It's hard. Hours are brutal.

01:35:03.298 --> 01:35:05.926
No, you gotta be a kid to start a ranch.

01:35:20.214 --> 01:35:22.182
Hey.

01:35:27.322 --> 01:35:29.620
I might go back ahead of you.

01:35:36.631 --> 01:35:38.724
You mean home?

01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:42.528
I was thinking of it.

01:35:47.809 --> 01:35:49.868
Whatever you want, Etta.

01:35:54.082 --> 01:35:56.175
Maybe I'll go.

01:36:05.293 --> 01:36:07.386
Hey.

01:36:08.062 --> 01:36:11.293
Etta's thinking of maybe
goin' home ahead of us.

01:36:15.069 --> 01:36:17.162
Whatever she wants.

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.567
I'll go, then.

01:36:58.946 --> 01:37:01.039
¡Manos arriba!

01:37:01.949 --> 01:37:06.409
- How much you got?
- It's hardly worth it. Alpoca Mine.

01:37:06.487 --> 01:37:10.423
- I tell you, no more jungle work for me.
- You're gettin' to be an old maid.

01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:13.858
Keep your old-maid remarks to yourself,
if you don't mind.

01:37:13.928 --> 01:37:17.728
I'll work in the city and mountains,
but from now on jungle work is out!

01:37:18.633 --> 01:37:21.261
¿Bandidos Yanquis?

01:37:21.335 --> 01:37:23.496
Tell 'em to be quiet.

01:37:23.638 --> 01:37:26.038
- What's the word?
- Quietos.

01:37:26.107 --> 01:37:28.166
¡Quietos!

01:37:37.718 --> 01:37:40.585
I tell you,
the jungle's a better cover for payrolls.

01:37:40.721 --> 01:37:45.385
Kid, I got a right to my opinion, and in
my opinion there are snakes in the jungle.

01:37:45.493 --> 01:37:48.189
I don't work around snakes.

01:37:48.296 --> 01:37:50.560
What is this place?

01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:53.166
I don't know. San Vicente, I think.

01:37:53.501 --> 01:37:56.061
- ¿Comer?
- Sí, señor. Pasen.

01:37:56.137 --> 01:37:58.605
¡Juan! Ven. Llévate los caballos.

01:38:24.765 --> 01:38:29.566
I don't enjoy jungles or swamps. I don't like
snakes. I don't much care for night work.

01:38:29.637 --> 01:38:31.935
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

01:38:33.407 --> 01:38:35.967
¡Capitán!¡Capitán!

01:38:36.043 --> 01:38:39.206
Capitán, allíen la plaza
hay una mula de las minas de Alpoca.

01:38:39.313 --> 01:38:41.372
- ¿De las minas de Alpoca?
- Sí, sí.

01:38:41.449 --> 01:38:45.818
Allíestá, dos hombres la acaban de traer,
están comiendo en elrestorán de mipapá.

01:38:46.053 --> 01:38:50.217
Elguisado está delicioso.
Para chuparse los dedos.

01:38:51.225 --> 01:38:54.820
Es la especialidad de la casa.

01:38:54.929 --> 01:38:59.957
Se quieren más no tengan pena y díganmelo.
Yo estoyaquípara servirles.

01:39:00.034 --> 01:39:03.993
Agradezco la visita
de tan distinguidos caballeros.

01:39:04.071 --> 01:39:06.403
Muchas gracias. Para servirles.

01:39:06.574 --> 01:39:08.633
- Muchas gracias.
- Sí.

01:39:12.046 --> 01:39:15.209
The specialty of the house
and it's still movin'!

01:39:23.591 --> 01:39:27.550
Well, that settles it.
This place gets no more of my business.

01:39:35.303 --> 01:39:37.066
- Hey.
- What?

01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:39.298
What do you think?

01:39:39.407 --> 01:39:41.466
I bet it's just one guy.

01:39:49.417 --> 01:39:51.908
Don't you get sick of being right all the time?

01:40:22.350 --> 01:40:24.443
Reloading.

01:40:27.121 --> 01:40:29.214
That's all I got.

01:40:33.461 --> 01:40:37.056
We're gonna run out unless
we can get to that mule and get some more.

01:40:41.469 --> 01:40:43.528
I'll go.

01:40:43.638 --> 01:40:46.732
This is no time for bravery. I'll let you.

01:40:48.509 --> 01:40:50.374
Loaded.

01:40:57.285 --> 01:40:59.913
Hell! I'm the one that has to go.

01:41:01.889 --> 01:41:03.379
Why you?

01:41:03.491 --> 01:41:07.052
Cos I could never give you cover.
You can cover me.

01:41:10.264 --> 01:41:12.732
You can see I'm right, can't you?

01:41:18.906 --> 01:41:23.138
- You go.
- Yeah, why am I always so damned smart?

01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:32.077
Here. Gimme your gun.

01:41:39.193 --> 01:41:41.286
OK. Go!

01:41:57.978 --> 01:42:00.139
OK!

01:42:38.886 --> 01:42:40.854
Go!

01:44:24.925 --> 01:44:27.951
Is... is that what you call giving cover?

01:44:28.696 --> 01:44:30.960
Is that what you call running?

01:44:31.799 --> 01:44:34.529
If I... knew you were gonna stroll...

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:39.497
You never could shoot,
not from the very beginning.

01:44:45.279 --> 01:44:47.372
And you are all mouth!

01:44:55.789 --> 01:44:57.882
Jefe, ya llegó el ejército.

01:45:09.303 --> 01:45:11.396
¡Mi capitán!

01:45:12.139 --> 01:45:14.403
- ¿Dónde están?
- Allíen la plaza.

01:45:14.508 --> 01:45:17.204
- ¿Cuántos hombres son?
- Dos hombres.

01:45:17.311 --> 01:45:18.608
- ¿Dos?
- Mi capitán...

01:45:18.712 --> 01:45:21.306
- ¿Dos?
- Bandidos Yanquis.

01:45:22.316 --> 01:45:25.012
- Bandidos Yanquis, ¿eh?
- Sí, mi capitán.

01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:30.186
¡Sargento Rico! Desmonte a veinte hombres
y que vengan con el teniente.

01:45:30.257 --> 01:45:33.954
¡Sargento! Rodeen elzócalo,
ysuban hacia la azotea y espérenme.

01:45:34.028 --> 01:45:37.589
¡Media vuelta en ellugar!¡Alfrente!

01:46:45.933 --> 01:46:49.425
- I got a great idea where we should go next.
- I don't wanna hear it.

01:46:49.536 --> 01:46:52.733
- You'll change your mind when I tell ya.
- Shut up!

01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:55.001
- OK, OK.
- Your great ideas got us here...

01:46:55.075 --> 01:46:57.942
- Forget it!
- I never wanna hear another of your ideas.

01:46:58.045 --> 01:47:00.104
- All right.
- OK.

01:47:09.923 --> 01:47:12.016
Australia.

01:47:14.328 --> 01:47:18.355
I figured,
secretly you wanted to know, so I told you.

01:47:18.465 --> 01:47:20.524
Australia.

01:47:21.435 --> 01:47:26.634
- That's your great idea?
- Oh, boy, it's the latest in... in a long line.

01:47:26.707 --> 01:47:29.676
- Australia's no better than here.
- That's all you know.

01:47:29.743 --> 01:47:32.974
- Name me one thing...
- They speak English in Australia!

01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:36.743
- They do?
- Yeah, smart guy. We wouldn't be foreigners.

01:47:39.953 --> 01:47:44.652
They got horses in Australia. Hell, they got
thousands of miles we could hide out in.

01:47:44.725 --> 01:47:47.159
Good climate, beaches.
You could learn to swim.

01:47:47.261 --> 01:47:50.162
No! Swimming isn't important.

01:47:52.666 --> 01:47:54.725
What about the banks?

01:47:55.469 --> 01:47:58.165
They're easy. Easy, ripe and luscious.

01:48:02.876 --> 01:48:04.776
The banks or the women?

01:48:04.878 --> 01:48:07.540
Well, once you got one, you got the other!

01:48:11.485 --> 01:48:15.012
- It's a long way though.
- Everything's gotta be perfect with you!

01:48:15.122 --> 01:48:18.387
I just don't wanna get there
and find out it stinks, that's all.

01:48:18.492 --> 01:48:20.551
At least think about it.

01:48:22.563 --> 01:48:25.157
All right.

01:48:25.232 --> 01:48:27.325
I'll think about it.

01:48:31.538 --> 01:48:33.403
Hey.

01:48:34.508 --> 01:48:38.171
When we get outside,
when we get to the horses,

01:48:38.245 --> 01:48:40.338
just remember one thing.

01:48:44.418 --> 01:48:46.750
- Hey, wait a minute.
- What?

01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:50.016
You didn't see Lefors out there, did you?

01:48:50.124 --> 01:48:52.422
Lefors?

01:48:52.526 --> 01:48:54.619
No.

01:48:54.762 --> 01:48:56.662
Oh, good.

01:48:56.797 --> 01:48:59.925
For a moment there
I thought we were in trouble.

01:49:06.974 --> 01:49:09.875
¡Fuego!

01:49:09.977 --> 01:49:12.445
¡Fuego!

01:49:14.047 --> 01:49:16.538
¡Fuego!

01:50:18.345 --> 01:50:21.678
