00:01.001 --> 00:03.753
[pensive music playing]

00:03.837 --> 00:06.464
Please hurry, Ms. Keen.
He doesn't like to be kept waiting.

00:06.548 --> 00:10.927
Is that how it works around here?
He snaps his fingers, everyone trembles?

00:11.928 --> 00:13.680
If they have any sense.

00:14.556 --> 00:15.724
Aren't you coming?

00:24.566 --> 00:26.443
Oh, thank God you're here.

00:26.526 --> 00:29.988
The boys and I were chatting
about failed expectations.

00:30.071 --> 00:30.947
I'll catch you up.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.200
First I said,
Kansas was an awful bloodbath.

00:34.284 --> 00:37.537
And, sure, that was fun,
but you let Reddington get away.

00:37.620 --> 00:41.916
Then they said, "So sorry,
we promise to do better next time!

00:42.000 --> 00:44.419
Please, Neville,
what about my wife and kids?"

00:44.502 --> 00:47.005
To which I said, "Wife and kids?"

00:47.088 --> 00:50.091
What about my wife? What about my kids?

00:51.468 --> 00:53.011
You're insane!

00:56.181 --> 00:59.309
Why, because I stabbed a man
who was suffocating?

00:59.392 --> 01:01.394
I suppose that was crazy of me.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.855
Almost as crazy as partnering
with an FBI agent.

01:03.938 --> 01:05.190
No. No!

01:07.984 --> 01:10.361
You find him at his girlfriend's,

01:10.445 --> 01:13.823
have him at gunpoint,
but somehow he gets away?

01:13.907 --> 01:15.075
Why is that?

01:15.158 --> 01:18.036
Why don't I have everything
you promised me?

01:18.119 --> 01:19.120
[gasping]

01:21.873 --> 01:24.542
I have a lead. On Reddington.

01:25.126 --> 01:26.753
I can prove he's N-13,

01:26.836 --> 01:29.172
and in communication with the Russians.

01:29.714 --> 01:30.673
Do you, now?

01:31.341 --> 01:34.052
I suppose there's only one way
to find out. Go.

01:34.135 --> 01:36.304
Pursue. Live the dream.

01:36.387 --> 01:37.472
But, Elizabeth...

01:38.640 --> 01:40.183
don't disappoint me again.

01:52.278 --> 01:54.280
[birds chirping]

01:58.743 --> 02:00.328
[chirping echoing]

02:00.411 --> 02:02.455
[pensive music playing]

02:20.223 --> 02:22.559
Anne, stay with me.

02:26.688 --> 02:29.732
Belsky reached out. He said it's urgent.

02:32.193 --> 02:35.572
Anne had a daughter-- Has a daughter.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.907
You must put that behind you.

02:38.533 --> 02:42.203
Belsky has information
that concerns Townsend and Elizabeth.

02:42.787 --> 02:46.624
-Then I suppose we'll act on it.
-Raymond, there's something else.

02:47.959 --> 02:48.960
Paula called.

02:49.544 --> 02:50.837
Glen's mother Paula?

02:50.920 --> 02:54.132
Yes. She wanted you to call
or come by the house.

02:54.215 --> 02:57.343
Then she said something
about new irons in the fire.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.887
Hot ones, she said.

02:59.762 --> 03:03.224
-Oh, my God. Sounds like she's dating.
-[chuckles] That's what I said.

03:03.308 --> 03:06.769
And she laughed and said,
"No, nothing like that.

03:06.853 --> 03:10.648
This is business. Serious business."

03:10.732 --> 03:12.025
And then she said,

03:12.108 --> 03:14.944
"All right, then, Dembe.
I'll see you and Raymond at the house.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.572
What happened to Bill and Steven?

03:18.907 --> 03:20.366
She knows, Raymond.

03:24.746 --> 03:25.580
Why?

03:29.918 --> 03:34.797
Histiaeus. What's to be learned from him
other than tyranny and duplicity?

03:34.881 --> 03:37.508
There you have it. A history of mankind.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.510
Tyranny and duplicity.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.346
You've come a long way

03:41.429 --> 03:45.475
from the 8th Directorate, Comrade--
Uh, Professor Belsky.

03:46.100 --> 03:50.313
Although I see your affinity
for authoritarians hasn't changed.

03:50.396 --> 03:56.236
Histiaeus wanted to organize a revolt
but feared discovery by the Persians.

03:56.903 --> 03:59.864
So he shaved the hair
of his favorite slave

03:59.948 --> 04:02.992
and had the treasonous message
tattooed on his head.

04:03.409 --> 04:06.913
When the hair grew back,
he sent him off to spread the word,

04:06.996 --> 04:11.042
which became the first recorded act
of steganography in warfare.

04:11.668 --> 04:15.546
Of course, my KGB ciphers
are no more relevant today

04:15.630 --> 04:17.048
than tattooing a head.

04:17.632 --> 04:21.344
So you can imagine my surprise
when I stumbled across this.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.429
[suspenseful music playing]

04:24.847 --> 04:27.392
[Cooper] I don't understand.
Are you getting leads from a psychic?

04:27.475 --> 04:29.602
[Raymond] To predict the future?
I don't know.

04:29.686 --> 04:34.274
At 5.99 a minute, Madame Zorba might be
a bargain at twice the price.

04:34.357 --> 04:37.443
If there was a Madame Zorba,
but there isn't.

04:37.527 --> 04:38.820
You're showing me a fake ad.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.822
It's not an ad. It's a message.

04:40.905 --> 04:44.659
A code that I believe Townsend
and Elizabeth may be using

04:44.742 --> 04:46.744
to communicate with an associate.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.914
"Love is a knot
that even death cannot untie."

04:50.498 --> 04:52.250
Sounds like a Hallmark card.

04:52.333 --> 04:56.421
Having failed to kill me,
I suspect Elizabeth and Townsend

04:56.504 --> 04:59.507
may be planning
to move against those around me.

04:59.590 --> 05:04.679
-In my world and possibly in yours.
-Her fight is with you, not us.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.515
Yes. But you're with me.

05:07.598 --> 05:09.517
And she's with Townsend,

05:09.600 --> 05:14.605
who takes great pride in displaying
his utter disregard for human life.

05:15.273 --> 05:20.695
"Love is a knot" isn't an aphorism,
it's a clue to decrypting the code.

05:21.279 --> 05:23.489
<i>As you well know, during the Cold War,</i>

05:23.573 --> 05:26.993
<i>nobody mastered the art</i>
<i>of clandestine communication</i>

05:27.076 --> 05:28.703
<i>better than the Soviets,</i>

05:28.786 --> 05:31.914
<i>their pièce de résistance</i>
<i>being a cipher machine</i>

05:31.998 --> 05:37.628
<i>capable of encrypting or decrypting text</i>
<i>into ten different languages.</i>

05:37.712 --> 05:40.506
The Russkiy Uzel, the Russian Knot.

05:40.590 --> 05:44.761
<i>The Kremlin destroyed most of them</i>
<i>prior to the fall of the Soviet Union,</i>

05:44.844 --> 05:48.222
<i>so Lord knows</i>
<i>how Townsend got his hands on one.</i>

05:48.306 --> 05:49.307
Clearly he did.

05:49.390 --> 05:53.186
If we want to decrypt that message,
we need to get one too.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.730
I don't think this is something
we can order on Amazon.

05:55.813 --> 05:59.942
The only other machine I know of
is on display in a museum in Minsk.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.235
Beautiful city.

06:01.319 --> 06:02.779
Amazing opera house.

06:02.862 --> 06:05.740
I'd forgotten how beautiful
until yesterday.

06:05.823 --> 06:07.784
-You were just in Minsk?
-Yes.

06:07.867 --> 06:11.287
In order to make a generous donation
to said museum

06:11.370 --> 06:14.040
from a private collection.

06:14.123 --> 06:15.958
Nana was born in Minsk.

06:16.042 --> 06:21.172
I can think of no better way
to honor her passing than with this gift.

06:21.255 --> 06:24.258
-You gave the museum a Cézanne?
-A stolen one.

06:24.342 --> 06:27.637
Which,
like all good and greedy bureaucrats,

06:27.720 --> 06:30.223
they're trying to decide
whether to report.

06:30.306 --> 06:35.520
Imagine their embarrassment
when the FBI finds it in their possession.

06:35.603 --> 06:38.397
You donated the painting.
Now you want us to go get it back.

06:38.481 --> 06:41.651
Yes. Along with the Russian Knot.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.694
Why would they give us that?

06:43.778 --> 06:47.406
Last I checked,
your country had sanctions in place

06:47.490 --> 06:50.493
against both the president of Belarus
and his son.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.995
They're not giving you anything.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.497
You want us to steal it.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.999
Of course. What do you think
we've been talking about?

07:02.713 --> 07:05.550
[Aram] This cipher machine
is pretty fascinating.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.969
You use the little keyboard
to type up your message,

07:08.052 --> 07:10.596
which it then jumbles
into a random series of letters.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.057
Then on the receiving end,
you need another machine

07:13.141 --> 07:15.476
to turn the gobbledygook
back into regular text.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.562
But this thing's 50 years old.

07:17.645 --> 07:19.814
Can't you crack the code without it?

07:19.897 --> 07:22.024
It's not exactly
Orphan Annie's decoder ring.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.110
The complexity of the Knot's algorithm

07:24.193 --> 07:26.696
compounds every letter
after it is entered,

07:26.779 --> 07:31.868
netting us a trillion, trillion,
trillion different possibilities.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.120
[Park] We want to know what Keen
and Townsend are up to,

07:34.203 --> 07:37.373
but are we really talking about robbing
the Belarusian War Museum?

07:37.457 --> 07:39.083
We've done worse.

07:39.167 --> 07:42.295
Reddington made it clear
there's no diplomatic angle.

07:42.378 --> 07:45.506
Townsend has illicit relationships
with the Council of Ministers.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.508
If we reach out for help, he'll be tipped.

07:47.592 --> 07:50.219
To what?
We don't know what Keen's planning.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.762
Ruddiger, what do you got?

07:52.680 --> 07:57.477
This bores through rock
using ultrasonic vibrations.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.021
[whirring softly]

08:00.104 --> 08:01.981
[lively music playing]

08:04.484 --> 08:07.028
-A lot quieter too.
-It's not very deep.

08:07.111 --> 08:09.280
Don't we need to get through
two feet of concrete?

08:09.363 --> 08:12.700
Only needs to be deep enough
for the SCDA to do its thing

08:12.783 --> 08:15.411
and to keep me
out of the boss's heavy bag.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.955
What you gain in noise reduction,

08:18.039 --> 08:19.916
you lose in predictability.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.669
It takes time to heat up and expand,

08:23.753 --> 08:26.464
for the pressure to build,
until finally...

08:29.050 --> 08:30.635
[imitates explosion]

08:34.680 --> 08:36.098
Talk to me about access.

08:36.182 --> 08:39.477
Once we're in,
we need to smuggle the cipher device out.

08:39.560 --> 08:42.396
The lab's mocking up a fake
to leave in its place as we speak.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.649
We need to loop security feeds
to make the swap.

08:44.732 --> 08:47.527
Okay, but how do we gain entry
into their security passage?

08:47.610 --> 08:49.195

08:57.703 --> 08:59.455

09:01.040 --> 09:02.959
Pack it up. It's time to go.

09:03.042 --> 09:06.254
-Now? Why so soon?
-[Cooper] The breach happens Friday night.

09:06.337 --> 09:08.297
When the museum is hosting its fundraiser.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.299
Staff won't like the FBI presence,

09:10.383 --> 09:12.385
won't wanna cause a scene
in front of donors,

09:12.468 --> 09:15.096
which means they're more likely
to fall for our diversion.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.391
[chattering]

09:20.476 --> 09:22.019
[Liz] Oh!

09:22.103 --> 09:25.439
-I'm so sorry! Let me help you.
-No, it's okay.

09:25.523 --> 09:26.774
Don't worry about it.

[beeps]

09:29.485 --> 09:30.319
[Liz] Hey.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.154
Forgot your wallet.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.197
Thank you.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.367
Anyone unclear? Any questions?

09:36.826 --> 09:39.370
The big question
is what's Liz really up to?

09:39.453 --> 09:42.373
If we're successful
in bringing this device home,

09:42.456 --> 09:44.542
we have a good shot at finding out.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.627
[upbeat music playing]

10:08.232 --> 10:09.358
[in Russian] What's going on?

10:09.442 --> 10:10.359
Something wrong?

10:20.661 --> 10:22.872
Let me know if we have a problem.

10:27.543 --> 10:31.297
At the terminus, go left.
Then straight ahead, 200 feet.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.090
<i>Once you're on site,</i>

10:33.174 --> 10:36.510
you need to be 12 feet, two inches
off the center of the north wall.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.599
[museum director] Your credentials
appear to be in order,

10:41.682 --> 10:43.684
but you're in the wrong country.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.394
[Cooper] I go wherever he takes me.

10:45.936 --> 10:48.022
Notorious fugitive Raymond Reddington.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.441
I'm told you accepted
a stolen painting from him.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.193
He called himself Lloyd Wilke.

10:52.276 --> 10:54.111
[Cooper] I could alert Interpol.

10:54.195 --> 10:57.114
They'd love to swarm your museum
and arrest you as an accomplice

10:57.198 --> 10:58.491
after the fact,

10:58.574 --> 11:01.243
but that might kill the mood
of this evening.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.037
Yes. That would be terrible.

11:03.120 --> 11:06.415
Or you have your people
show my team your security feeds

11:06.499 --> 11:08.626
while I look at that Cézanne.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.022
Four minutes.

11:30.606 --> 11:33.442
All right.
You get started, I got the sensors.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.075
Beautiful city, by the way.

11:41.742 --> 11:44.703
It's true what they say,
Minsk isn't just concrete.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.081
But there is some beautiful concrete.

11:47.164 --> 11:50.459
Hey, Aram, it's Cooper.
Something about a legal attaché.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.711

13:29.058 --> 13:30.309
[Ressler] Aram, we're in place.

13:30.392 --> 13:34.104
[Aram] <i>Give me a minute to record</i>
<i>enough footage to loop the feeds.</i>

13:34.188 --> 13:35.940
[material spraying]

13:43.155 --> 13:44.782
[in Russian] That him? In the hat?

13:44.865 --> 13:46.033
Yeah, that's him.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.246
Where's Peanut?

13:56.418 --> 13:58.003
[Aram] Cameras are bypassed.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.213
You're good to go.

14:03.175 --> 14:05.302
-[Liz] Hurry. Hurry.
-Okay. Any minute now.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.137
[cell phone ringing]

14:07.221 --> 14:09.306
Don't answer. It's about to blow.

14:10.224 --> 14:11.225
What?

14:11.308 --> 14:12.476
Hello?

14:12.560 --> 14:13.936
I just had a dream about you.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.105
<i>I'm sorry, now is not a good time.</i>

14:16.188 --> 14:17.606
Don't interrupt or I'll forget.

14:17.690 --> 14:21.193
<i>I was at a wedding,</i>
<i>about to greet the bride and groom.</i>

14:21.277 --> 14:22.945
<i>But everyone was crying</i>

14:23.028 --> 14:26.448
and I realized this isn't a wedding,
it's a funeral.

14:29.535 --> 14:32.413
Aram, we're ready to open the case.
Are the sensors down?

14:32.496 --> 14:35.291
Uh, guys? This is weird,
but the sensors are already off.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.049
I hate funerals.

14:44.133 --> 14:47.136
<i>I'm absolutely squeamish</i>
<i>about open caskets.</i>

14:47.219 --> 14:48.178
<i>I was terrified.</i>

14:48.262 --> 14:51.181
<i>That's when I felt</i>
<i>someone squeeze my hand.</i>

14:51.265 --> 14:52.141
It was you.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.810
You were holding my hand
and I wasn't afraid anymore.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.438
<i>-Guess who was in the casket.</i>
-[Liz] I don't know.

14:57.521 --> 14:58.522
Reddington!

14:58.606 --> 15:01.275
And he looked hideous.
All sunken and yellow.

15:01.358 --> 15:03.110
I'm sorry, I really have to--

15:03.193 --> 15:06.864
<i>I know I was harsh before,</i>
<i>but this dream is a good sign.</i>

15:06.947 --> 15:10.200
I am rooting for you, Elizabeth.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.201
I gotta go.

15:12.536 --> 15:15.664
-He said he had a dream about me.
-He is creepy.

15:21.962 --> 15:23.631
What the hell is going on?

15:43.609 --> 15:44.485
Run.

15:48.322 --> 15:50.366
[dramatic music playing]

15:50.449 --> 15:53.661
-[exclaims] The badge. I left it in--
-What are you doing?

15:53.744 --> 15:56.288
-Forget the badge.
-We can't get through without it.

15:56.372 --> 15:57.247
We'll go on foot.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.083
I'll be back. Meet you in the van.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.293
[grunts]

16:01.377 --> 16:03.837
It's her. She's in the building.
Keen's got the cipher.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.255
Aram, tell me you have eyes.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.424
[Aram] Got her.
Basement, near the east stairwell.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.510
Agent Park is around the corner.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.055
Oh, no.

16:17.685 --> 16:20.354
[grunting]

16:25.901 --> 16:27.611
It really is a lovely piece.

16:28.195 --> 16:30.364
[classical music playing]

16:30.447 --> 16:32.449
[dramatic music playing]

16:54.054 --> 16:56.348
I always wanted a hero moment.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.225
I got the badge.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.604
Let's go. Grab the Knot.

17:03.105 --> 17:05.107
Yeah, I got it. I'm right behind you.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.569
[Ressler] Where's Park?

17:10.154 --> 17:13.824
-You're gonna shoot me? For this?
-You don't understand.

17:13.907 --> 17:15.993
I'm dead without the device.

17:16.076 --> 17:19.038
Shoot me. Show me there's nothing
left of the old Elizabeth Keen.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.206
The cipher. I have to have it.

17:21.915 --> 17:25.210
Why? For Townsend?
So we can't read his messages?

17:26.045 --> 17:30.007
Townsend? He doesn't know I'm--

17:31.759 --> 17:33.260
Why would you say that?

17:33.343 --> 17:34.803
[Esi] <i>Liz, where are you?</i>

17:34.887 --> 17:36.430
Liz, we need to go now.

17:42.227 --> 17:43.062
[Ressler] Park!

17:48.984 --> 17:49.860
Is she okay?

17:49.943 --> 17:53.238
-[Park] Yeah, I'm okay.
-Where's Liz? Where'd she go?

17:53.322 --> 17:55.240
[dramatic music playing]

18:05.667 --> 18:08.962
-You're not taking the painting?
-My concern is finding Reddington.

18:09.046 --> 18:12.549
Agents from our Art Theft Unit
will be in touch to discuss the details.

18:12.633 --> 18:13.467
Excuse me.

18:15.928 --> 18:16.970
[Ressler] We got a problem.

18:17.846 --> 18:20.349
-What kind of problem?
-A Liz Keen problem.

18:22.768 --> 18:28.482
[Paula] My pumpkin cheesecake thumbprints
are sort of legendary.

18:28.565 --> 18:31.401
-They were Glen's favorite.
-Thank you, Paula.

18:32.569 --> 18:33.904
Yes. Thank you, Paula.

18:33.987 --> 18:36.281
You're welcome, Steve, Bill.

18:38.158 --> 18:40.869
Paula, is there anything
you'd like to tell us?

18:42.329 --> 18:44.248
I used canned pumpkin.

18:44.331 --> 18:45.332
Ah.

18:47.417 --> 18:50.546
-You know who I am.
-I do.

18:50.629 --> 18:54.967
I'm so sorry. I know it's a big secret.

18:55.050 --> 18:57.052
How did you find out, Paula?

18:58.512 --> 19:02.599
I found this under Jelly's bed.

19:03.767 --> 19:08.814
I say manuscript,
but it's really more of a memoir.

19:08.897 --> 19:10.566
[Raymond] Glen was writing a book.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.693
About your time together.

19:12.776 --> 19:16.196
The hijinks and shenanigans.

19:16.780 --> 19:20.701
Oh, don't worry, I don't think
he sent it to any publishers yet.

19:20.784 --> 19:22.202
I can't believe this.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.203
I can.

19:23.912 --> 19:25.455
Me too.

19:25.539 --> 19:31.587
It makes a whole lot more sense
than Jelly being Huey Lewis' muse.

19:31.670 --> 19:35.007
Paula, why are you telling me
all of this now?

19:35.090 --> 19:36.925
That's the thing.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.262
I've been retired from Ma Bell
for some time now.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.306
I've been keeping to my budget.

19:42.389 --> 19:45.309
But after Jelly died,

19:45.392 --> 19:48.312
without his income, um,

19:48.395 --> 19:53.817
things have gotten sort of tight.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.737
Now, I'm not asking for a handout,

19:56.820 --> 20:01.408
I went back to work
at the phone company part-time,

20:01.491 --> 20:04.578
but if you could maybe lend me--

20:04.661 --> 20:05.746
How much do you need?

20:05.829 --> 20:08.832
One hundred and seventy-two dollars.

20:08.916 --> 20:12.878
And I'll pay it back with interest.

20:12.961 --> 20:17.216
Or I could work it off, pressing that suit

20:17.299 --> 20:22.346
or maybe cooking you two
a nice cream can dinner.

20:22.429 --> 20:25.682
Well, that does sound nice,
but, Paula, this is a gift.

20:25.766 --> 20:29.895
One I offer you in exchange
for your continued discretion.

20:29.978 --> 20:31.605
No gifts.

20:31.688 --> 20:34.441
I have to insist on paying you back.

20:34.524 --> 20:38.403
Then let's just say
I'm purchasing Glen's manuscript.

20:43.283 --> 20:45.911
That would mean a lot to him.

20:45.994 --> 20:48.497
You say you've gone back to work
at the phone company?

20:48.580 --> 20:51.166
Yeah. The cellular one. The big one.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.962
Eighteen hours a week now. Why do you ask?

20:58.340 --> 21:00.425
[suspenseful music playing]

21:01.009 --> 21:01.927
What on earth?

21:02.010 --> 21:05.055
Reddington must've donated the painting
so he could case the museum.

21:05.138 --> 21:08.350
-What do you think he was after?
-The Russian Knot.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.435
[museum director]
That machine's one of a kind.

21:10.519 --> 21:11.728
[Cooper] Lucky we stopped him.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.689
Yes. Thank God for the FBI.

21:14.189 --> 21:16.692
Your local police
are gonna wanna secure the area.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.527
We should clear everyone out.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.746
Tell me that was the fake.

21:30.497 --> 21:32.708
Well, thank God for the FBI.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.173
[pensive music playing]

21:40.257 --> 21:43.510
[Cooper] We got the device.
The Art Theft Unit got the Cézanne.

21:43.593 --> 21:46.555
Excellent.
Please tell me you made it to the opera.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.181
<i>We didn't. Keen made sure of that.</i>

21:48.265 --> 21:50.392
Oh, of course. She was there.

21:50.475 --> 21:53.437
That's what I can't square.
The "of course" of it.

21:53.520 --> 21:57.149
You told me she and Townsend
were using the device

21:57.232 --> 21:58.692
<i>to encrypt their communiques.</i>

21:58.775 --> 22:01.987
That you'd intercepted those communiques,
but couldn't decrypt them

22:02.070 --> 22:04.740
unless we went to Minsk
and got the device.

22:04.823 --> 22:07.576
Something Elizabeth
would never have wanted you to do.

22:07.659 --> 22:10.078
What I can't square
is how she knew we were doing it.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.039
Or why, when I mentioned Townsend's name,

22:12.122 --> 22:14.541
Keen acted like
he had no idea she was there.

22:14.624 --> 22:16.501
I can't speak to any of that.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.795
But all that matters
is that you have the device

22:18.879 --> 22:21.214
and I have the ability
to show you how to use it

22:21.298 --> 22:23.216
to read the text on that billboard.

22:23.300 --> 22:26.928
Which I'll do as soon as I finish
with a pressing appointment.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.556
More than stopping Townsend
and finding Elizabeth?

22:29.639 --> 22:31.058
For the moment.

22:31.892 --> 22:34.102
Paula, tell me something good.

22:34.186 --> 22:39.649
Well, you know Ernie in billing has
had his eye on me since his missus passed.

22:40.400 --> 22:45.113
So I took him up on an offer
to have dinner at Perkins.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.491
I sort of sweet-talked him.

22:47.574 --> 22:51.745
Anyway, I told him
I did one of those spit tests,

22:51.828 --> 22:57.834
found out I had a half-sister
and was just desperate to get an address.

23:03.757 --> 23:08.178
Emma Foster.
Date of birth, address, phone number.

23:08.762 --> 23:10.680
He just went and got it for you?

23:10.764 --> 23:15.519
I always told Jelly
you get more bees with honey.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.979
You are the bee's knees, Paula.

23:20.232 --> 23:23.693
-Oh, and what's this?
-Receipt from Perkins.

23:23.777 --> 23:28.573
If it's not too much, I'd like to get
reimbursed for the chicken dinner.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.575
Ernie wanted to go Dutch.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.494
[groans] Ernie.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.372
[cell phone ringing]

23:39.709 --> 23:41.837
-Ressler.
-[Liz] Reddington's lying to you.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.506
You wanna tell me about it?
How about turning yourself in?

23:44.589 --> 23:46.842
He told you I wanted the device

23:46.925 --> 23:49.594
to keep him from reading messages
between me and Townsend.

23:49.678 --> 23:52.139
A theory you proved
by trying to keep us from it.

23:52.222 --> 23:54.808
I wasn't there to keep you
from reading my messages.

23:54.891 --> 23:57.561
I was there to get it so I could read his.

23:57.644 --> 23:59.604
Wait. The billboard is his?

23:59.688 --> 24:02.065
Billboard?
I don't know anything about that.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.025
I know Reddington uses the Knot

24:04.109 --> 24:07.737
to decrypt messages in classified ads
in the <i>Washington Post.</i>

24:07.821 --> 24:10.073
If he's decrypting messages
using a Russian Knot,

24:10.157 --> 24:12.284
why send us to Minsk to get another?

24:12.367 --> 24:15.829
So I couldn't read what he
and his handler are saying to each other.

24:15.912 --> 24:17.289
That's who he's talking to.

24:17.372 --> 24:19.666
If I could prove
he's talking to the Russians--

24:19.749 --> 24:20.876
Prove he's N-13.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.836
I'm not the enemy.

24:23.461 --> 24:26.840
He is. Please. Let me prove it to you.

24:29.259 --> 24:30.635
Keen wants to meet?

24:30.719 --> 24:33.096
What she wants is to destroy the device

24:33.180 --> 24:35.515
so we can't know
what she and Townsend are planning.

24:35.599 --> 24:37.475
No. I think she wants to use the device

24:37.559 --> 24:40.395
to prove Reddington's communicating
with his Russian handler.

24:40.478 --> 24:42.522
We should at least hear her out.

24:42.606 --> 24:45.817
-You think we should give her a big hug?
-She probably needs one.

24:46.776 --> 24:51.114
The Russian Knot's a relic of the Cold War
that creates an analog code.

24:51.198 --> 24:53.700
Newspaper classifieds
barely exist anymore.

24:53.783 --> 24:55.952
This sounds more like Mr. Reddington

24:56.036 --> 24:58.622
than it does Agent Keen
or Neville Townsend.

24:58.705 --> 25:01.291
I appreciate your reluctance, Agent Park.

25:01.374 --> 25:05.337
But if there's a chance this could finally
prove that Reddington's a Russian agent,

25:05.420 --> 25:07.797
I think we need to hear
what Agent Keen has to say.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.799
She'll wanna know
I have your word on this.

25:09.883 --> 25:12.093
That we won't double-cross her.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.845
You have it. Call her back.

25:22.854 --> 25:24.981
Cooper signed off. How this is gonna work?

25:25.065 --> 25:27.651
Grab a pen, and listen carefully.

25:31.404 --> 25:36.618
This is Assistant Director Harold Cooper,
authorization code 39587.

25:36.701 --> 25:39.913
I need to requisition a team
for surveillance and apprehension.

25:49.839 --> 25:50.674
Who is it?

25:51.883 --> 25:53.134
[Raymond] Emma Foster?

25:54.261 --> 25:55.387
Who's asking?

25:55.470 --> 25:57.722
My name is Farwell Smith.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.267
Your mother's attorney.

26:03.853 --> 26:05.146
You work with my mom.

26:06.022 --> 26:08.858
I helped her
with some of her estate planning.

26:09.442 --> 26:10.860
She never mentioned you.

26:11.611 --> 26:15.282
Most of my clients
don't mention me to their children.

26:15.365 --> 26:18.410
Wills and trusts can be awkward.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.371
It's all part of the job,

26:21.454 --> 26:24.207
in order to deliver
a little bit of good news

26:24.291 --> 26:27.043
at an otherwise mournful time.

26:29.296 --> 26:30.255
Mournful?

26:33.383 --> 26:35.677
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

26:40.140 --> 26:41.474
Anne passed away.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.906
I am so sorry for your loss.

27:09.669 --> 27:11.755
[pensive music playing]

27:12.380 --> 27:13.840
Hey, Keen. I'm here.

27:13.923 --> 27:16.593
[Liz] <i>There's a man selling pretzels</i>
<i>at the 72nd Street crossover</i>

27:16.676 --> 27:18.428
<i>above the fountain. Buy one.</i>

27:18.511 --> 27:21.556
[Cooper] He's headed into the park.
Keen knows our vehicles will pull back.

27:21.639 --> 27:23.350
Beta Team, stand down.

27:23.433 --> 27:25.018
Delta, can you go on foot?

27:31.483 --> 27:33.151
Drop your cell in the trash.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.076
Down the steps, by the fountain.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.289
I don't have a visual.
Somebody get me eyes.

27:46.373 --> 27:48.083
Beta, clear emergency access.

28:00.428 --> 28:02.097
So you have bodyguards now.

28:03.181 --> 28:04.265
Is that it?

28:04.849 --> 28:06.351
You have Reddington's ad?

28:07.310 --> 28:10.438
Did Reddington tell you
how he knew I'd be in Minsk?

28:11.439 --> 28:15.568
I think he thinks I told you.
It's the romantic in him.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.279
[whirring]

28:18.363 --> 28:21.908
-Okay. Enter the number first.
-That belong to your mother?

28:24.536 --> 28:27.122
Tell me you at least tried calling that?

28:27.205 --> 28:28.331
It's not a phone number.

28:28.415 --> 28:30.750
It's a key
meant to orient the machine's settings.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.670
Yes, this book belonged to my mother.

28:33.753 --> 28:37.090
Along with a storage locker filled with
half-solved clues about Reddington

28:37.173 --> 28:39.676
and a series of encrypted messages.

28:39.759 --> 28:41.428
There's more than one?

28:42.053 --> 28:45.306
And if we can decrypt this one,
we can decrypt all of them.

28:45.974 --> 28:47.517
Okay. Now what?

28:47.600 --> 28:50.478
[Liz] The circled letters in order.

28:52.063 --> 28:54.065
[man] <i>I have eyes. Should we move in?</i>

28:54.149 --> 28:56.151
Keep your distance
until units are in place.

28:56.234 --> 28:58.737
We don't know what protection she has.
Keep this clean.

28:58.820 --> 29:03.199
C-M-A. That's it.

29:08.496 --> 29:11.249
You okay? Keen, what is it?

29:11.332 --> 29:13.585
I don't know
how Reddington knew I was coming.

29:13.668 --> 29:15.920
I don't know how he knows
half the things he does.

29:17.046 --> 29:19.507
But I do know that I am right about this.

29:20.300 --> 29:21.801
I wish you'd believe me.

29:22.385 --> 29:23.428
I do believe you.

29:24.971 --> 29:26.681
I wish you didn't need proof.

29:37.150 --> 29:39.652
That's the message. Numbers?

29:39.736 --> 29:41.738
I don't understand.

29:41.821 --> 29:43.656
[ominous music playing]

29:43.740 --> 29:46.659
Maybe we did it wrong.
Maybe we need to try again.

29:50.538 --> 29:52.081
Damn it. Keen, hey!

29:52.165 --> 29:53.333
This isn't me!

29:53.958 --> 29:55.335
Send them in, now!

29:55.418 --> 29:59.756
-We're made. Go now. Move in.
-Keen, wait! They lied to me!

30:04.427 --> 30:09.182
Hey, Keen. Hey, stop!
Stop. Keen, they lied to me.

30:09.265 --> 30:10.642
I had no idea. I swear.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.063
Oh, my God.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.482
[dramatic music playing]

30:28.117 --> 30:30.620
-She's somewhere under the terrace.
-All units, move in.

30:30.703 --> 30:32.413
I repeat, move in now.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.894
[Emma] This can't be right.

30:56.813 --> 30:59.524
Your mother had a considerable estate.

30:59.607 --> 31:02.360
We talked about it
as recently as a year ago.

31:02.443 --> 31:04.696
I was gonna get like, 3000.

31:04.779 --> 31:06.573
Not 3 million.

31:07.156 --> 31:10.368
Perhaps she wanted it
to be a pleasant surprise.

31:11.995 --> 31:14.497
Did you know she was in love
with a wanted fugitive?

31:15.623 --> 31:16.791
[emotional music playing]

31:16.875 --> 31:19.586
-She told you that?
-She called last week.

31:19.669 --> 31:24.048
About him and how these people
had come to where she lived to kill him.

31:24.966 --> 31:27.343
I tried asking her what was going on.

31:27.427 --> 31:30.221
All she wanted
was for me to protect myself.

31:30.305 --> 31:33.933
That the people who were after him
might come after her or me.

31:34.767 --> 31:36.561
I thought it was crazy talk...

31:37.061 --> 31:39.731
but she insisted I drop everything...

31:41.107 --> 31:42.859
and go into hiding.

31:44.193 --> 31:46.529
So I came here and waited.

31:47.530 --> 31:50.867
She told me she was hoping to stay
with a friend in a cabin on a lake...

31:52.368 --> 31:54.829
and she'd call me
when everything settled down.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.832
That was the last time
I ever spoke to her.

32:02.503 --> 32:03.922
I don't know what to say.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.176
Did you know her well?

32:09.135 --> 32:09.969
I did.

32:11.512 --> 32:16.017
Then you can understand why I want
to remember her love and kindness.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.561
Not her connection to a criminal.

32:18.645 --> 32:21.064
I can't do that if any of this money
comes from him.

32:22.398 --> 32:24.734
Can you promise me that it doesn't?

32:26.194 --> 32:27.862
I can't promise you that.

32:30.782 --> 32:37.246
But I can promise you that your mother
wanted you to have everything

32:37.330 --> 32:39.290
that she could possibly give you.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.543
That would include this.

32:43.878 --> 32:44.796
Think about it.

32:45.797 --> 32:48.341
You can always donate it to a charity.

32:48.925 --> 32:50.218
Set up a scholarship.

32:51.678 --> 32:52.595
Put on a play.

32:54.055 --> 32:58.935
At the very least pay all your bills,
buy something for yourself.

32:59.018 --> 33:03.147
And then, if you want,
you can give the rest of it away.

33:05.942 --> 33:07.193
Just think about it.

33:14.867 --> 33:16.119
How did she die?

33:20.498 --> 33:21.916
It was an accident.

33:23.501 --> 33:24.877
Caused by the fugitive?

33:24.961 --> 33:25.837
No.

33:30.174 --> 33:32.760
But he was responsible.

33:36.514 --> 33:37.348
Tell me.

33:38.182 --> 33:42.812
A man like that, do you think
he'll ever get what's coming to him?

33:48.776 --> 33:49.610
I do.

33:57.452 --> 33:59.704
[Esi] You're crazy. You do know that.

34:00.329 --> 34:02.415
-I think of it as determined.
-Yeah.

34:02.498 --> 34:04.625
Determined to get yourself killed.
For what?

34:04.709 --> 34:06.461
We couldn't crack the code.

34:06.544 --> 34:10.757
You had the messages and the machine
to decrypt it, and what did you get?

34:10.840 --> 34:14.010
-A whole lot of nothing.
-We must be missing a step.

34:14.093 --> 34:17.805
-An input my mom didn't know about.
-Say there is, and we figured it out,

34:17.889 --> 34:20.558
you think the FBI
is letting you near that machine again?

34:20.641 --> 34:23.978
Ressler gave you a shot.
He's not giving you another one.

34:26.022 --> 34:30.151
How did Reddington know we'd be in Minsk?
We didn't tell anybody.

34:30.777 --> 34:36.574
We found the folder of classified ads.
We reviewed my mom's notes on encryption.

34:36.657 --> 34:38.701
We needed the Russian Knot to decrypt it.

34:38.785 --> 34:40.870
We went to Minsk to try and get it.

34:40.953 --> 34:43.623
Where's the opening
for Reddington in that?

34:43.706 --> 34:45.416
[dramatic music playing]

34:45.500 --> 34:46.876
-Belsky.
-Belsky.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.463
-We trusted you.
-And I value that trust.

34:50.546 --> 34:54.050
-I value my life more.
-Which is why you told Reddington.

34:54.133 --> 34:56.803
I was told to report
any inquiry about a code

34:56.886 --> 34:59.430
that requires the Russian Knot to decrypt.

34:59.514 --> 35:02.183
He was clear
on how important that was to him.

35:02.266 --> 35:03.768
I know what that means.

35:03.851 --> 35:07.146
So the minute we showed you the ads,
you showed him.

35:07.230 --> 35:11.192
[Belsky] She heard I was an expert
on the Russian Knot.

35:11.275 --> 35:15.988
She knew the ads were a code
and was hoping I could decrypt them.

35:16.072 --> 35:19.492
Mid-30s, brown hair, blue eyes?

35:20.368 --> 35:23.621
I didn't tell him it was you.
He seemed to know already.

35:23.704 --> 35:27.375
You told me I needed a Russian Knot
to decrypt the message.

35:27.458 --> 35:29.502
I got one and still can't read it.

35:29.585 --> 35:31.963
There are keys you need to read the code.

35:32.046 --> 35:35.424
-I have them, the phone number.
-Maybe there were more.

35:35.508 --> 35:38.386
-Or the ones you had were wrong.
-Give me the right ones, then.

35:38.970 --> 35:42.557
-I don't know them.
-Well, then find me a person who does!

35:42.640 --> 35:47.270
The only person who has the keys
is the one who encrypted the message.

35:47.979 --> 35:48.896
Reddington.

35:49.772 --> 35:50.857
Great.

35:52.900 --> 35:55.820
-Is there anything on Elizabeth?
-Not a word.

35:55.903 --> 35:58.698
Dembe has the faith
that comes from belief.

35:58.781 --> 36:00.408
All I have are questions.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.911
Why? How? What for? Was it worth it?

36:04.495 --> 36:05.830
The answer's no.

36:05.913 --> 36:08.916
Whatever the outcome,
it most certainly was not.

36:09.792 --> 36:11.794
-Well, at least you have it.
-[Cooper] I do.

36:11.878 --> 36:14.547
Along with the hope
that I'm not being played.

36:17.466 --> 36:20.761
[Raymond] All right.
First, type in the telephone number.

36:22.346 --> 36:25.516
I assume the Cézanne
has been returned to its rightful place

36:25.600 --> 36:28.352
at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.

36:28.436 --> 36:29.770
It has.

36:30.396 --> 36:34.066
Now the first letter of each word,
in order.

36:35.276 --> 36:39.238
I gave up the commission
on the sale of a $20 million painting.

36:39.322 --> 36:44.202
And enraged the consigliere
who entrusted me with the task.

36:45.036 --> 36:48.915
Do you really think I'd do all that
just to play you, Harold?

36:49.457 --> 36:51.459
[machine clicking]

37:04.764 --> 37:06.307
[Cooper] A bunch of numbers?

37:06.390 --> 37:11.103
Yes. Until you substitute each number
for the corresponding letter.

37:11.187 --> 37:14.565
One becomes A, two becomes B,
and so forth.

37:14.649 --> 37:15.775
Do you have a pen?

37:19.278 --> 37:20.863
All right. Let's hurry.

37:20.947 --> 37:24.283
I'm morbidly curious
to find out what painful end

37:24.367 --> 37:26.369
Elizabeth has in store for me.

37:27.370 --> 37:30.206
[Cooper] The code was the address
for some abandoned warehouse.

37:30.289 --> 37:32.792
-A date and time.
-Instructions for a hit.

37:32.875 --> 37:35.586
The device spit out random numbers.
What were we missing?

37:35.670 --> 37:36.545
One more step.

37:36.629 --> 37:39.298
Each number represents a letter.

37:39.382 --> 37:43.219
-So the billboard was a message.
-Reddington told us the truth.

37:43.302 --> 37:44.637
And Keen didn't.

37:44.720 --> 37:45.596
[cell phone ringing]

37:49.892 --> 37:52.603
I understand why you're upset.
I wasn't honest with you.

37:53.479 --> 37:56.941
For what it's worth, I wish I'd been wrong
to doubt your judgment about Keen.

37:57.024 --> 37:59.318
-You were wrong.
-How can you say that?

37:59.819 --> 38:02.697
She said this was about keeping her
from Mr. Reddington's intel.

38:02.780 --> 38:05.533
We now know it was about
keeping him from reading hers.

38:05.616 --> 38:07.118
I know that's what it looks like.

38:07.201 --> 38:10.329
It looks that way because it is that way.
You need to accept that.

38:11.414 --> 38:13.833
Why? So you stop following me?

38:23.009 --> 38:25.469
-Raymond!
-Hello, Paula.

38:25.553 --> 38:26.804
Thank you for coming.

38:26.887 --> 38:30.308
How was the drive?
Did Dembe talk your ear off?

38:30.391 --> 38:31.684
It was just great.

38:31.767 --> 38:36.856
Sometimes I like to lean my head
on the window next to me.

38:36.939 --> 38:40.443
So I can feel all of the little bumps
on the road.

38:40.526 --> 38:46.407
And my vision starts to flutter,
and I just space out like I'm in a dream.

38:47.074 --> 38:48.784
That sounds nice.

38:49.535 --> 38:51.746
You know what also sounds nice?

38:51.829 --> 38:53.122
Employment.

38:53.831 --> 38:55.333
Did you get a new job?

38:55.416 --> 38:57.793
I did not. I'm offering one.

38:57.877 --> 39:00.254
Ah. What kind of job?

39:00.338 --> 39:02.173
A service provider.

39:02.256 --> 39:06.135
Are you asking me to find people for you?

39:06.802 --> 39:08.220
Like Jelly Bean did?

39:08.304 --> 39:11.515
Why don't we sit, have a cup of tea,

39:11.599 --> 39:15.519
share some tawdry tales,
have a laugh or two,

39:15.603 --> 39:16.979
and then we'll drive you home?

39:17.063 --> 39:21.734
You can put your head up against the glass
and go to your happy place,

39:21.817 --> 39:24.945
and I can tell you
what it is I have in mind.

39:28.699 --> 39:30.701
[cell phone ringing]

39:32.370 --> 39:33.496
-Ressler.
-[Liz] <i>Hey.</i>

39:33.579 --> 39:35.539
Thank God you're all right, Keen.

39:35.623 --> 39:38.042
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>why I'm returning this call.</i>

39:38.125 --> 39:40.461
Look, I'm sorry.
They used me to lure you out.

39:40.544 --> 39:41.921
Yeah. A lot of good that did.

39:42.505 --> 39:46.008
You're right. But at least now
I know what those numbers mean.

39:46.092 --> 39:48.260
Because Cooper handed the device
to Reddington.

39:48.344 --> 39:49.387
He did.

39:49.470 --> 39:51.514
So they decoded his fake message.

39:51.597 --> 39:55.059
<i>-They think I'm a liar.</i>
-No. But I don't. I'll prove it.

39:55.142 --> 39:57.144
I know the step you're missing.

39:57.228 --> 40:01.107
Each number stands for a letter.
One is A, two is B, three is C.

40:01.190 --> 40:04.276
-They're using alphanumeric substitution.
<i>-Exactly.</i>

40:04.360 --> 40:07.613
Hang on. Okay. Seventeen is Q.

40:08.614 --> 40:10.616
Sixteen is O. No.

40:10.699 --> 40:12.910
<i>Sixteen is P.</i>

40:12.993 --> 40:15.704
Eighteen is R. One is A.

40:15.788 --> 40:17.081
<i>-Fourteen?</i>
-N.

40:17.164 --> 40:18.416
<i>-Sixteen?</i>
-P.

40:18.499 --> 40:19.959
[Liz] <i>Two is B.</i>

40:20.960 --> 40:23.546
-Wait. That doesn't make any sense.
-What does it say?

40:23.629 --> 40:26.215
"Q-P-R-A-N-P-B." It's not a word.

40:26.298 --> 40:29.051
<i>Maybe it's backwards</i>
<i>or the letters of each word are jumbled.</i>

40:29.135 --> 40:32.430
Reddington told us this is how it works.
It has to say something.

40:34.932 --> 40:36.308
Oh, my God. That's it.

40:37.685 --> 40:39.145
The Cyrillic alphabet.

40:39.854 --> 40:43.607
We translated the numbers into English
because that's what Reddington did,

40:43.691 --> 40:45.985
but his message was a fake
meant to throw us off.

40:46.068 --> 40:47.862
[dramatic music playing]

41:23.189 --> 41:24.356
Oh, my God.

41:24.440 --> 41:25.691
What does it say?

41:25.774 --> 41:28.652
"It's time. Mobilize assets."

41:29.778 --> 41:32.698
A message from a Russian handler
to a Russian spy.

41:32.781 --> 41:35.159
-Reddington.
<i>-But what does he mean?</i>

41:35.242 --> 41:36.785
It's time. Time for what?

41:45.085 --> 41:46.795
Rise and shine, sleepy head.

41:46.879 --> 41:48.047
Elizabeth.

41:48.130 --> 41:50.508
You wanted proof? I got you proof.

41:50.591 --> 41:52.551
Proof that Reddington is N-13.

41:52.635 --> 41:55.429
Proof that he's responsible
for what happened to your family.

41:55.513 --> 41:58.057
And proof that my mother was innocent.

41:58.140 --> 41:59.350
[gasping]

42:00.059 --> 42:03.229
I can walk you through the details
after you catch your breath.

42:03.312 --> 42:07.483
After you get it through your
thick skull that you do not threaten me!

42:07.566 --> 42:12.238
Because while we may be partners
in this hunt, I do not work for you.

42:21.705 --> 42:23.707
[dramatic music playing]
