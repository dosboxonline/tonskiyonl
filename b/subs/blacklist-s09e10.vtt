00:01.001 --> 00:03.670
["(Open Up The Door)
Let The Good Times In" playing]

00:04.295 --> 00:07.173
Guys, that is a packing job,
if I ever saw one.

00:07.257 --> 00:09.592
Bravo. I love that stuff.

00:10.301 --> 00:12.095
<i>-♪ Toes out of my shoes... ♪</i>
-Um...

00:12.178 --> 00:14.931
Yeah, no, not that.
That's 10:00. Ten o'clock.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.933
Ten o'clock, please? Please.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.518
Okay, good, boys.

00:18.601 --> 00:21.646
This is great,
but I need them moved to the truck.

00:21.730 --> 00:22.731
Good.

00:22.814 --> 00:25.650
Yeah, what's shaking, boys? Keep it going.

00:25.734 --> 00:28.111
Thank you. Thank you. Good job.

00:28.194 --> 00:29.404
Come on.

00:31.448 --> 00:35.410
Okay, let's get these crates sealed.

00:35.493 --> 00:39.080
Last truck is rolling in 20, chop-chop.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.125
Patented plants.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.877
What a concept.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.463
What's next, Bobby, copyrighting clouds?

00:46.546 --> 00:49.257
You'd find a way
to turn a profit on those too.

00:49.340 --> 00:51.801
-You bet your ass I would.
-[both laugh]

00:54.554 --> 00:55.805
[loud thud]

00:57.015 --> 00:58.016
What the hell?

01:00.185 --> 01:01.603
[officer 1] FBI!

01:02.520 --> 01:03.772
Get on the ground!

01:04.272 --> 01:05.523
Get on the ground!

01:05.607 --> 01:06.775
[officer 2] Don't move.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.694
[officer 3] Federal agents!

01:10.653 --> 01:13.448
Raymond, we got trouble.

01:24.626 --> 01:28.296
Raymond, I am not surprised
you didn't anticipate the raid.

01:28.379 --> 01:29.756
You've been distracted.

01:29.839 --> 01:34.219
Looking for the person responsible for
Elizabeth's death is hardly a distraction.

01:34.302 --> 01:36.387
No. It's a waste of time.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.681
Not if I find them.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.518
Even if there was someone, which I doubt,

01:41.601 --> 01:44.437
finding them
will not bring Elizabeth back.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.147
It only delays you healing.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.732
Or house-hunting.

01:47.816 --> 01:52.570
Heddie may be just another cog
in the machine of my organization,

01:52.654 --> 01:55.824
but she's a fragile and unpredictable cog.

01:55.907 --> 01:59.244
She won't last long behind bars.
You need to get her out.

01:59.327 --> 02:01.246
I'll do my best, <i>mon capitaine.</i>

02:01.913 --> 02:05.291
Though perhaps you might have
more luck talking to your task force pals.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.168
What else are FBI friends for?

02:07.252 --> 02:09.087
Investigating the Seer.

02:09.754 --> 02:12.006
-You mean on the Blacklist?
-Yes.

02:12.757 --> 02:13.800
It's brilliant.

02:13.883 --> 02:16.094
-[Cooper] Absolutely not.
-Come on, Harold.

02:16.177 --> 02:18.763
Hedwig was caught
with over a million dollars' worth

02:18.847 --> 02:20.849
-of pirated soybean seeds.
-Pirated?

02:20.932 --> 02:24.227
Heddie was just selling seeds
to farmers at a price.

02:24.310 --> 02:27.147
If my associate is guilty of anything,

02:27.230 --> 02:30.191
it's simply trying
to ease the economic strain

02:30.275 --> 02:34.654
on the hardworking men and women
who put the tofu in your turkey,

02:34.737 --> 02:38.658
the cotton in your shirt,
the beans in your coffee.

02:38.741 --> 02:40.660
Everything it means to be human.

02:40.743 --> 02:43.705
But our agreement is with you,
not your employees.

02:43.788 --> 02:46.249
If she talks, it will be damaging.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.376
How much is hard to tell.

02:48.459 --> 02:53.089
But it would certainly have repercussions
for me and for this task force.

02:53.172 --> 02:56.342
We have a deal with you. The rest
of the Justice Department doesn't.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.720
I can't just pick up the phone
and get her out.

02:58.803 --> 03:02.140
I can only hope that reciprocal generosity

03:02.223 --> 03:06.269
is a concept that
one day will have meaning for you.

03:06.352 --> 03:10.690
Until that day,
have you ever heard of Arcane Wireless?

03:10.773 --> 03:12.066
Sounds like a phone company.

03:12.150 --> 03:16.070
With a black market operating system
that cannot be tapped

03:16.154 --> 03:18.740
or traced by law enforcement.

03:18.823 --> 03:22.493
A couple of thousand beta phones
have been sold to date,

03:22.577 --> 03:25.955
but word is the company
is about to go wide.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.206
That's cause for alarm.

03:27.290 --> 03:31.628
One of the FBI's most powerful tools,
other than me,

03:31.711 --> 03:33.796
is the federal wiretap warrant.

03:33.880 --> 03:38.551
Last year, those warrants resulted
in nearly 7000 arrests.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.721
Imagine all of those criminals,
all of that evidence,

03:41.804 --> 03:44.015
well outside of your reach.

03:44.098 --> 03:47.977
That's what will happen
if you don't stop Arcane Wireless.

03:48.645 --> 03:52.357
Juan Miguel Rojas,
enforcer for the Castillo Cartel.

03:52.440 --> 03:55.151
This image was captured
from a bank in El Paso

03:55.235 --> 03:58.488
minutes after
he murdered an informer's family.

03:58.571 --> 04:02.742
Richard Slade,
military-grade weapons trafficker.

04:02.825 --> 04:06.162
Clients range from
Boogaloo Bois to the Taliban.

04:06.246 --> 04:10.625
And Clyde MacFarlane leads
the Mount Porte Motorcycle Club.

04:10.708 --> 04:13.920
Though they started out
and are still based in West Virginia,

04:14.003 --> 04:17.298
they now handle a large portion
of the methamphetamine trade

04:17.382 --> 04:19.884
from the Great Lakes
all the way down to the Gulf Coast.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.303
But it's nothing new
that criminals use cell phones.

04:22.387 --> 04:26.057
Arcane Wireless isn't a public company.
It's underground, invite-only,

04:26.140 --> 04:28.351
and those invites go
to the worst of the worst.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.770
The service is like
an electronic cone of silence.

04:30.853 --> 04:31.980
It's working.

04:32.063 --> 04:35.650
Arcane's clients have been avoiding arrest
since they started using the phones.

04:35.733 --> 04:38.403
Reddington says these phones
are about to flood the market?

04:38.486 --> 04:40.405
He does, which means we're on a clock.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.241
And all we have to go on
is the moniker of the man in charge.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.576
<i>According to Reddington,</i>
<i>he's known as the Seer.</i>

04:50.707 --> 04:52.250
-You the Seer?
-Where's your boss?

04:52.333 --> 04:54.377
You want his business,
you play by his rules.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.838
[Ressler] <i>If these phones</i>
<i>are interfering with investigations,</i>

04:56.921 --> 04:58.589
<i>maybe the Bureau has open case files.</i>

04:58.673 --> 05:01.634
I can reach out to a contact
at Information Security who'd know.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.678
-Who is it?
-FJ Powell.

05:03.761 --> 05:07.181
He actually was my mentor
who taught me everything I know,

05:07.265 --> 05:09.976
including that
I could never be as good as him.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.686
This should be fun.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.689
-[door buzzes]
-[guard] Step through.

05:19.819 --> 05:21.529
-[metal detector whirring]
-[shouts]

05:21.612 --> 05:24.615
Trying to make me lose
what little hearing I have left?

05:26.451 --> 05:30.371
Can I see my client now,
or you wanna do a full cavity search too?

05:33.416 --> 05:34.500
Hey.

05:35.251 --> 05:36.878
Marvin, thank Christ.

05:38.755 --> 05:39.589
Heddie.

05:48.222 --> 05:49.057
Heddie?

05:49.724 --> 05:50.558
Raymond?

05:50.641 --> 05:53.561
First, how are you?
Were you hurt in the raid?

05:53.644 --> 05:55.730
No, I'm fine.

05:55.813 --> 05:58.232
But where'd those fed bastards come from?

05:58.316 --> 06:00.109
You let me worry about that.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.571
Until we sort this out, you just luxuriate

06:03.654 --> 06:05.656
in your right to remain silent.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.242
Of course. Anything for you.

06:08.326 --> 06:10.244
So how long before I'm sprung?

06:10.328 --> 06:13.748
I need to warn you that
this is bigger than a few soybeans.

06:13.831 --> 06:16.334
They're planning on throwing
the whole book at you.

06:16.417 --> 06:20.004
Racketeering, conspiracy,
aiding and abetting a fugitive.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.173
Yeah, you say that like it matters.

06:22.256 --> 06:26.469
We have a 52-card deck of aces
up our sleeve. Right, Ray-Ray?

06:26.552 --> 06:28.137
[Marvin] <i>No, not this time.</i>

06:28.221 --> 06:31.432
Wait, no? But I have macaws.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.101
-Macaws?
-<i>Not to worry.</i>

06:33.184 --> 06:35.853
I've got a very sweet guy
to watch your birds.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.022
How long? They can live to be 60,

06:38.106 --> 06:40.858
and Mango needs ointment
for her beak disease,

06:40.942 --> 06:43.027
and Princess is more demanding

06:43.111 --> 06:46.197
than an opera singer
with allergies on opening night.

06:46.280 --> 06:50.118
-I need to be there for them.
-<i>Heddie, just relax. Take a breath.</i>

06:50.201 --> 06:53.412
Marvin smuggled an earwig
into a federal facility

06:53.496 --> 06:58.084
so that you could hear my voice
telling you, we will take care of this.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.711
You have nothing to worry about.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.964
<i>So sit tight and stay strong.</i>

07:03.047 --> 07:05.174
Okay. I'm okay.

07:23.025 --> 07:26.028
I trust my associates
treated you respectfully.

07:26.112 --> 07:30.199
In my line of work, one has
to take certain security precautions.

07:30.950 --> 07:31.951
That's funny?

07:32.034 --> 07:34.454
What's funny is that you think blindfolds

07:34.537 --> 07:37.331
and driving around in circles
equals security.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.499
Your phone.

07:45.423 --> 07:48.593
Yeah, well, location services are off.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.219
You'd think that'd be sufficient,

07:50.303 --> 07:53.973
but people can't resist
using their phones for things like... Aha.

07:54.765 --> 07:56.809
Jalapeño poppers on Grubhub.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.978
Thanks to your late-night cravings,

07:59.061 --> 08:01.481
every 30 seconds,
his phone is sending out a ping

08:01.564 --> 08:03.483
to see if he's in a Grubhub service area.

08:03.566 --> 08:08.029
Any law enforcement officer with cause can
walk right through that door right now.

08:08.112 --> 08:09.697
"Grub what you love."

08:18.247 --> 08:19.874
That's one liability down.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.793
I can get rid of all of them
and replace them

08:22.877 --> 08:25.087
with phones that
can't be hacked or tracked.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.132
-I want to see them in action.
-I'll schedule a demonstration.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.843
Bring any expert.
I've never had an unhappy client.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.803
Minor players, no doubt.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.765
I do business on four continents.

08:35.848 --> 08:38.267
You traffic on four continents.

08:38.851 --> 08:41.062
Women, children.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.689
You're a troubled person
who does terrible things,

08:43.773 --> 08:47.276
and one day you'll be caught, unless...

08:48.236 --> 08:49.362
you're invisible.

08:50.738 --> 08:55.117
If your product is as good
as you say, I'll be buying thousands.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.786
Four continents? Odin...

08:57.495 --> 08:59.914
I'm about to give you
the whole damn planet.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.765
-What?
-Hello.

09:18.849 --> 09:19.976
I, um...

09:20.059 --> 09:22.770
I was going... Well, your door...

09:22.853 --> 09:24.397
Still a fumferer.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.357
-A what?
-I hate fumfering.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.359
And yet you cause so much of it,

09:29.193 --> 09:30.570
sir-- Agent Powell.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.488
Um, hello, FJ.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.031
You had promise.

09:34.615 --> 09:35.866
Why did you waste it?

09:35.950 --> 09:37.159
I didn't know I had.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.996
The private sector, tech.
I thought you'd be in it by now.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.748
Oh, yeah, tech. I tried that. Didn't take.

09:42.832 --> 09:47.336
But now I'm on a federal task force
looking into Arcane Wireless.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.671
Have you heard of it?

09:48.754 --> 09:52.758
Oh, if I had,
why should I tell you about it?

09:52.842 --> 09:56.512
Actually, because after
a few conversations between my boss

09:56.596 --> 09:59.640
and your boss' boss' boss,

09:59.724 --> 10:01.142
you've been ordered to.

10:08.274 --> 10:11.402
You outrank me, don't you?

10:11.485 --> 10:13.613
Only if you mean,
you know, hierarchically.

10:13.696 --> 10:17.617
But in any kind of meta way,
you are this, like, alpha beast,

10:17.700 --> 10:20.995
and I am not.

10:22.246 --> 10:27.543
Law enforcement has run into
a handful of these over the past year.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.671
Yesterday, highway patrol in West Virginia

10:30.755 --> 10:33.966
stumbled onto a biker running drug money.

10:34.050 --> 10:38.387
-He had this, fresh off the factory floor.
-It's been bricked?

10:38.471 --> 10:41.557
This network is not connected
to anything we've seen.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.184
It's totally impenetrable.

10:43.267 --> 10:45.728
Even when we get our hands on a phone,

10:45.811 --> 10:48.314
they're able
to wipe all the data remotely.

10:48.397 --> 10:51.400
I'll call this in. My task force
will want to interview the biker.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.862
In the meantime,
mind if I stay and take this phone apart?

10:55.946 --> 10:57.657
I'll get back to you on that.

10:57.740 --> 11:02.161
As soon as
I check with my boss' boss' boss.

11:02.703 --> 11:06.207
Technically, it's that boss' boss,
if you wanna be hierarchical,

11:06.290 --> 11:07.375
which I don't.

11:07.458 --> 11:10.294
But if you did, then that boss' boss.

11:12.421 --> 11:14.423
How was my client supposed to know

11:14.507 --> 11:18.636
that she was buying
the asexual clones of a protected legume?

11:18.719 --> 11:21.931
It's not like
the beans were stamped with a logo.

11:22.014 --> 11:26.394
And I happen to know that
seed patents are hell to prosecute.

11:26.477 --> 11:28.270
First you gotta prove disclosure,

11:28.354 --> 11:31.148
then test the specimens,
define the content.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.984
<i>Who needs it?</i>
<i>I'll tell you what we can do.</i>

11:34.068 --> 11:36.278
In exchange for reduced charges,

11:36.362 --> 11:42.076
my client will testify against the company
that sold her that spurious product.

11:44.161 --> 11:44.995
Are you done?

11:45.079 --> 11:48.124
Tell him you can keep going all day,
all night, all year, for eternity.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.625
[Marvin] <i>That's it for this angle.</i>

11:49.708 --> 11:53.003
But I got plenty of others.
I'll keep going until we make a deal.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.880
The state only has one deal to offer.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.215
Ah. Here it comes.

11:56.298 --> 11:57.800
Immediate release,

11:57.883 --> 12:00.344
a new name, a new life, a fresh start.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.512
In exchange for?

12:01.595 --> 12:04.390
Everything she knows
about Reddington and his activities.

12:04.473 --> 12:07.184
<i>Full cooperation.</i>
<i>We want names, we want dates.</i>

12:07.268 --> 12:09.103
<i>We want every possible detail.</i>

12:09.186 --> 12:10.896
Okay. Done.

12:10.980 --> 12:11.856
-Done?
-[Marvin] Done.

12:11.939 --> 12:14.233
-[Raymond] <i>Marvin, really?</i>
-[man] She'll flip on Reddington?

12:14.316 --> 12:15.609
Of course not.

12:16.861 --> 12:20.364
Look. We can protect you
against your employer.

12:20.448 --> 12:23.492
What we can't protect you against
is his rather colorful lawyer.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.619
Mr. Gerard may say he's representing you,

12:25.703 --> 12:28.122
but we know he's here
to look out for his real client.

12:28.205 --> 12:32.460
And that's the Raymond person?
Who's that again? I'm...

12:33.502 --> 12:36.088
-That's my girl.
-Twenty years. Minimum.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.758
Twenty years in prison,
rubbing elbows with killers.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.386
That's what you're looking at.
Is that how you wanna grow old?

12:42.470 --> 12:47.516
Well... what about that guy
from the prison film with Burt Lancaster?

12:47.600 --> 12:50.978
The one with the birds.
Do they let you keep birds?

12:51.061 --> 12:53.522
Macaws, specifically. I have two.

12:57.776 --> 13:01.280
[Aram] Okay.
So, whoever developed this is a genius.

13:01.363 --> 13:04.700
Not that I'm a genius,
but I found the log directory.

13:04.783 --> 13:08.662
And it recorded a time stamp
every time a call was connected.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.457
But what's weird is
every time that happened,

13:11.540 --> 13:15.377
the phone sent
an outgoing data packet to a server farm.

13:15.461 --> 13:18.923
-Do you have a final destination?
-No.

13:19.006 --> 13:23.219
In other words, you might've found
something if we can trace the server.

13:23.302 --> 13:26.055
And if we can,
if the server pings us back,

13:26.138 --> 13:31.477
and if it does, whether it pings us
where the messages have been sent.

13:31.560 --> 13:36.357
Okay, but imagine how great
it'll be if all those ifs all happen.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.568
I'll start running a trace.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.115
-What's that?
-Greylock?

13:45.199 --> 13:47.868
It's a tech company
with a security platform.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.537
No, yeah, that I know.

13:49.620 --> 13:52.831
-But why are you looking at it?
-None of your business.

13:52.915 --> 13:57.336
No, of course it's not.
Normally, it wouldn't be, I know that--

13:57.836 --> 13:59.630
Spit it out or swallow it.

13:59.713 --> 14:02.007
But for God's sakes, stop fumfering.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.467
It's my company.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.012
-Yours?
-Yeah, it is.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.764
Or it was.

14:09.473 --> 14:10.724
It's not now...

14:12.101 --> 14:13.102
but I created it.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.813
You're the CTO who left.

14:16.855 --> 14:18.399
How do you know that?

14:18.482 --> 14:20.150
I'm applying to be the CTO.

14:20.234 --> 14:23.779
-You're applying for my job?
-Yes, the job you left.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.573
Before you were vested.

14:25.656 --> 14:26.490
I was vested.

14:26.574 --> 14:30.369
I chose to make a clean break.
What makes you think that I...?

14:33.163 --> 14:35.040
Are they offering you ownership shares?

14:35.124 --> 14:36.041
[computer beeps]

14:36.625 --> 14:41.213
Uh, the trace is a dead end.
Proxies all the way down.

14:41.297 --> 14:44.800
They haven't offered me anything yet.

14:45.426 --> 14:46.802
I'm in the application stage.

14:46.886 --> 14:51.181
But the offer includes ownership shares,
shares that I gave up.

14:53.893 --> 14:58.814
We should keep looking in the directories,
see what other information we can find.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.610
[Ressler]
Mount Porte Motorcycle Club, huh?

15:02.693 --> 15:05.571
It looks like
you got pulled over driving a truck

15:05.654 --> 15:07.990
carrying $2 million worth of drug money

15:08.073 --> 15:10.200
all because of a broken taillight.

15:10.284 --> 15:13.162
-Got nothing to say about money.
-We don't care about the money.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.998
-We're here about your phone.
-My phone?

15:16.081 --> 15:18.834
You brought me here
to offer me an upgrade?

15:20.294 --> 15:23.297
Clyde MacFarlane, president of your club.

15:23.380 --> 15:26.759
The phone he's using is the same model
you had when you were arrested.

15:26.842 --> 15:28.969
-Where did you get it?
-I don't know.

15:29.970 --> 15:30.804
Walmart?

15:31.639 --> 15:32.890
Look, we need a name,

15:32.973 --> 15:35.559
or we put out the word
that you're a snitch

15:35.643 --> 15:38.437
and that the 2 million wasn't confiscated,

15:38.520 --> 15:41.065
but handed over
as part of our arrangement.

15:41.148 --> 15:44.652
-We don't have an arrangement.
-[Ressler] We will if you don't cooperate.

15:48.739 --> 15:49.657
Riggs.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.825
-Riggs who?
-[Randy] I don't know his first name.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.620
He's part of the club.
He ran the whole thing.

15:54.703 --> 15:57.247
Gave us phones, made us toss our old ones.

15:57.331 --> 16:00.167
-Where do we find Riggs?
-He's always in the same place.

16:00.250 --> 16:03.587
Far end of the bar
at Kelly's in Randolph County.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.298
[country music playing over speakers]

16:09.009 --> 16:11.637
-I'll get you another one, Riggs.
-Thank you, sugar.

16:13.013 --> 16:16.725
That smells good.
I'll have a plate of what he's having.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.855
Take your time coming back with it.

16:23.816 --> 16:24.942
What are you doing?

16:25.567 --> 16:28.904
One of your boys was arrested
carrying one of my phones.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.491
So? They're untraceable.
Thought that was the big sell.

16:32.574 --> 16:34.368
They are. I'm not.

16:36.078 --> 16:40.332
Arcane is about to go wide,
and I can't have the FBI sniffing around.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.333
Not now.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.378
Your head ain't right if you think
I'd tell a fed the time of day.

16:44.461 --> 16:48.132
Unfortunately for you,
I'm not willing to take that chance.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.803
On second thought,
I should've asked for this to go.

17:00.644 --> 17:01.603
Excuse me.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.273
Agents Ressler and Zuma, FBI.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.568
-We're looking for a man named Riggs.
-You and me both.

17:07.651 --> 17:09.778
One minute, he's ordering his usual,

17:09.862 --> 17:13.032
and the next, he has taken off
without saying goodbye.

17:13.115 --> 17:16.702
And now that I see the two of you,
I know I was right.

17:25.085 --> 17:27.046
How did she seem in person?

17:27.129 --> 17:28.714
She's trying to act tough,

17:28.797 --> 17:32.217
but it's not a performance
that's gonna win any Tonys.

17:32.301 --> 17:35.429
Heddie's got a big heart,
and it's in the right place,

17:35.512 --> 17:38.807
but if they send her upstate to eat
franks and beans with the tough gals,

17:38.891 --> 17:40.809
it's anyone's guess how she's gonna react.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.645
In that case, we got a serious problem.

17:43.729 --> 17:47.274
On my way out, I got wind
that the U.S. Attorney's Office

17:47.357 --> 17:51.070
has petitioned the court
to find Heddie alternate counsel.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.154
Why? She has you.

17:52.237 --> 17:55.449
Yeah, you also have me.
You pay me, and they know that.

17:55.949 --> 17:58.660
Despite my protestations otherwise,

17:58.744 --> 18:02.081
they're citing conflict of interest.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.750
They're cutting in to talk
to her in private, lean on her.

18:04.833 --> 18:08.545
Lean on her hard enough,
she'll fold faster than a lawn chair.

18:09.379 --> 18:13.175
Heddie might surprise us.
She exhibits a certain can-do attitude.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.344
She knows enough to make it hurt.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.054
If she rolls on you to that lawyer,

18:17.137 --> 18:20.682
they will whisk her straight
into hiding in never-never land.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.560
Next time you see her,
she will be sitting in a witness box,

18:23.644 --> 18:26.313
testifying against you in a federal court.

18:26.396 --> 18:28.899
Who do we know in the Eastern District?

18:29.858 --> 18:30.901
Judge Smathers.

18:30.984 --> 18:33.570
Get Heddie's case
transferred to his docket.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.489
Line some pockets, get it done.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.617
-Who's this?
-This is Itzhak.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.537
Fifteen years
in digital analysis for the Mossad.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.163
He's here for your demonstration.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.749
I won't be placing an order
without his sign-off.

18:45.833 --> 18:49.670
I am told that
you make a phone that is untraceable.

18:49.753 --> 18:51.421
A skeptic. Good.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.427
[operator] <i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

18:57.511 --> 18:59.513
It's not my emergency
you should worry about.

18:59.596 --> 19:02.057
Do you know what atrocities
we're committing abroad,

19:02.141 --> 19:03.600
originating from this very city?

19:03.684 --> 19:06.937
You don't. You don't care. You're asleep.
I'm about to wake everyone up.

19:07.020 --> 19:09.982
-<i>Sir, can I have your name?</i>
-I planted an IED in the Metro.

19:10.065 --> 19:12.442
-What are you doing?
-[Seer] There are 40 stations.

19:12.526 --> 19:15.529
You won't have time to find it
before it goes off with enough force

19:15.612 --> 19:18.574
to take out a block
and who knows how many innocents.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.450
<i>You sound upset. Can we--?</i>

19:20.534 --> 19:23.745
The instant I cried "bomb," she pressed
a button alerting her superior.

19:23.829 --> 19:27.541
They're attempting to triangulate
my location using cell towers.

19:27.624 --> 19:30.586
Itzhak, if you'd set a 60-minute timer.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.379
If their trace is successful,

19:32.462 --> 19:36.175
within the hour, agents will
break down that door and arrest us.

19:36.258 --> 19:39.928
None of which will happen
because I called on one of my phones.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.181
-If you're wrong?
-But I'm not wrong.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.057
Which is why I brought a deck of cards.

19:44.141 --> 19:48.061
We've got an hour to kill.
What's your game, Hold 'Em, Hearts, Gin?

19:48.145 --> 19:49.813
You called in a bomb threat.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.732
You wanna play a game of cards?

19:52.274 --> 19:53.817
That means I'm playing Solitaire.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.113
[Park] You stole the phone.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.365
No. I took it without permission.

20:00.449 --> 20:01.491
[Park] From your mentor.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.869
He stole my job, I stole his phone.

20:03.952 --> 20:06.622
He didn't.
He's applying for the job you quit.

20:06.705 --> 20:10.167
Do you know how much
Greylock raised in Series A financing?

20:10.250 --> 20:12.169
$19 million.

20:12.252 --> 20:15.380
You know what
my share of that would have been?

20:15.464 --> 20:18.425
-4.75 million.
-Which is why you stole the phone.

20:18.508 --> 20:21.345
Okay. First, no, it's not his phone.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.597
And second, yes, that's exactly why.

20:23.680 --> 20:27.017
Your mentor wants the job you left.
That should be rewarding.

20:27.100 --> 20:30.145
You know
what would be rewarding? 4.75 million.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.563
There's nobility in poverty.

20:31.647 --> 20:35.025
-We know who the Seer is.
-We got a link to footage of Kelly's.

20:35.108 --> 20:37.236
A dive bar
gave you access to their cameras?

20:37.319 --> 20:39.821
The wellness center across the street did.

20:39.905 --> 20:43.075
That's why Riggs wasn't at the bar.
The Seer got to him first.

20:43.158 --> 20:47.079
Our Seer is William Meyers, 46,
a fallen software engineer

20:47.162 --> 20:51.166
convicted of bilking the tech company
he founded out of $2 million.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.710
On his release, he hooked up
with Lyon Crime Syndicate.

20:53.794 --> 20:56.255
Guess he was looking for cash,
and Alonso Lyon wanted

20:56.338 --> 20:58.340
his communication systems updated.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.342
Someone from the crime syndicate

21:00.425 --> 21:03.178
took out someone loyal
to the Mount Porte Club?

21:03.262 --> 21:04.596
That won't end well.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.056
I tried pulling a BOLO,

21:06.139 --> 21:08.558
seems the Bureau issued one
on Meyers three years ago.

21:08.642 --> 21:10.852
He's almost as elusive as Reddington.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.021
It's a good thing we work with Raymond.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.983
He's done business with Lyon.
Maybe he can broker a meeting.

21:16.066 --> 21:17.067
Call him.

21:21.321 --> 21:22.281
Morning.

21:24.116 --> 21:27.327
-Who are you?
-Kamina Gilford. I'm a defense attorney.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.079
I already have one of those.

21:29.162 --> 21:31.331
The court has appointed me
to meet with you

21:31.415 --> 21:33.041
because an allegation has been made

21:33.125 --> 21:35.961
that you're represented
by Reddington's attorney.

21:36.044 --> 21:39.840
The court's intent is to assure
any decisions you make are yours,

21:39.923 --> 21:43.093
not influenced by a lawyer
who represents your boss.

21:43.176 --> 21:44.177
A crime boss.

21:44.261 --> 21:45.595
That's a lot of words.

21:46.221 --> 21:49.808
Words have power.
Your words have the power to save you.

21:49.891 --> 21:51.310
You want me to snitch.

21:51.393 --> 21:54.479
Can you tell me
you wanna spend 20 years in prison,

21:54.563 --> 21:58.275
if you're lucky, to protect a man
who kills without conscience?

21:58.358 --> 22:00.444
The evidence against you is airtight.

22:00.527 --> 22:03.780
And I can say as a trial lawyer,
if I had to defend you on these facts,

22:03.864 --> 22:04.740
I'd lose.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.366
-Does Marvin know you're here?
-No.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.036
And if you accept
the state's offer of witness protection,

22:09.119 --> 22:10.829
he won't be advised this is happening

22:10.912 --> 22:14.082
until you are safely
in protective custody.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.334
Your birds too.

22:16.126 --> 22:18.587
U.S. Marshals are standing by right now.

22:20.213 --> 22:22.007
Let's be clear, Heddie.

22:22.090 --> 22:25.218
This is your one opportunity
not to die in jail.

22:25.302 --> 22:27.804
The U.S. attorney has extended this offer.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.431
It's open for one hour.

22:29.514 --> 22:31.266
You need to decide now.

22:34.144 --> 22:35.228
[timer beeping]

22:37.147 --> 22:39.941
[man on TV] <i>We're getting more information</i>
<i>on a bomb threat</i>

22:40.025 --> 22:43.987
<i>that's prompted evacuations</i>
<i>of several office buildings downtown...</i>

22:44.071 --> 22:48.492
There's something inexplicably rewarding
about winning at Solitaire.

22:48.575 --> 22:52.496
You're not beating anyone
and yet it's really quite satisfying.

22:52.579 --> 22:54.206
How about you? You satisfied yet?

22:54.289 --> 22:55.624
I'm intrigued.

22:55.707 --> 22:56.625
[Seer] Only intrigued?

22:56.708 --> 22:58.794
You just witnessed
an incredible demonstration.

22:58.877 --> 23:00.629
[Itzhak] It's one thing to be untraceable.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.215
It's a whole other thing
to be intercepted,

23:03.298 --> 23:04.800
hacked and decrypted.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.135
Itzhak pioneered hacking techniques
for the Mossad

23:07.219 --> 23:08.637
that would make your head spin.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.973
I'll be calling from 771-555-0136.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.810
The operating system
on both phones is chainOS secure.

23:14.893 --> 23:16.645
What else do you need? Serial numbers?

23:16.728 --> 23:17.729
Storage capacity?

23:17.813 --> 23:20.315
Couldn't be closer than you are right now.

23:20.398 --> 23:23.235
You know, I'm always looking for talent.

23:23.318 --> 23:25.278
I might have a place for you.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.656
If you can penetrate this call.

23:28.865 --> 23:29.783
Hmm.

23:30.450 --> 23:31.660
This is unusual.

23:31.743 --> 23:32.661
[Odin] The encryption?

23:32.744 --> 23:34.955
No. I can't even get that far.

23:35.038 --> 23:37.624
The phone is plugged
directly into my system

23:37.707 --> 23:40.460
and I can't even register
a call in progress.

23:44.756 --> 23:46.716
I've never seen anything like this.

23:47.300 --> 23:48.552
[Seer] Satisfied now?

23:48.635 --> 23:51.138
With my technology in your pocket,

23:51.221 --> 23:54.474
you'll dominate
the global market in trafficking.

23:56.393 --> 23:58.436
You've made a believer of me.

23:58.937 --> 24:00.730
I'll buy every phone you have.

24:00.814 --> 24:01.648
Smart man.

24:02.399 --> 24:05.026
Now no one in law enforcement
can touch you.

24:16.872 --> 24:17.914
[door opens]

24:17.998 --> 24:19.833
Ah. Alonso.

24:19.916 --> 24:21.835
Thank you for coming on such short notice.

24:21.918 --> 24:22.836
Better be important.

24:22.919 --> 24:25.630
You just pulled me
from my daughter's dressage competition.

24:25.714 --> 24:29.301
I wanted to know what $30,000
in horse lessons bought me.

24:29.384 --> 24:30.927
I'll explain everything.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.596
Where's Reddington?

24:32.679 --> 24:35.015
[Raymond laughs]
Here's our other guest now.

24:35.098 --> 24:37.058
Alonso Lyon,

24:37.142 --> 24:39.561
may I introduce you to Clyde MacFarlane,

24:39.644 --> 24:42.647
president
of the Mount Porte Motorcycle Club.

24:42.731 --> 24:46.109
You got some nerve
to summon me, I don't care who you are.

24:46.902 --> 24:47.986
Why am I here?

24:48.069 --> 24:49.696
I'd like to know as well.

24:49.779 --> 24:51.198
[Raymond] You know what I love?

24:51.281 --> 24:53.158
A good documentary.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.079
Look at that.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.664
One of your men

24:59.748 --> 25:01.917
being taken by your men.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.794
Son of a bitch. You took out Riggs?

25:04.878 --> 25:06.963
I didn't. How do you even know he's dead?

25:07.047 --> 25:09.674
He got walked out of his local bar
by a couple of creeps.

25:09.758 --> 25:12.677
His ex-wife's hysterical.
He missed his son's first hockey game.

25:12.761 --> 25:16.640
He's never missed a day
dropping by the clubhouse in three years.

25:16.723 --> 25:18.683
Except yesterday and today.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.977
Tell me he's not gonna show up in a ditch.

25:21.061 --> 25:23.688
Whatever happened
didn't happen on my orders.

25:23.772 --> 25:27.651
I believe that's the Seer.
The Seer is in your employ.

25:27.734 --> 25:30.070
Seer? Is that the phone guy?

25:31.321 --> 25:33.281
He worked with me, yeah.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.618
I let him branch out
for a piece of the action.

25:36.701 --> 25:38.703
Providing a valuable service.

25:38.787 --> 25:40.872
Apparently to both of you.

25:40.956 --> 25:44.960
The question is, is it valuable enough
to turn the other cheek?

25:45.043 --> 25:47.796
-Not to me.
-I got nothing to do with this.

25:47.879 --> 25:51.007
And yet there's your former tech guru
in living color.

25:51.091 --> 25:55.345
Rumor has it he redesigned
your syndicate's entire security system,

25:55.428 --> 25:57.931
communications, surveillance.

25:58.014 --> 26:01.059
Transported you into the 21st century.

26:01.142 --> 26:03.103
Why are you stirring up trouble?

26:03.186 --> 26:06.231
My goal is the opposite.
Conflict mediation.

26:06.314 --> 26:09.359
Gang wars are bad
for all of our businesses.

26:09.442 --> 26:11.486
Please, let's sort this out.

26:11.569 --> 26:13.321
There's nothing to sort.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.657
Except which of his people
I kill to make us even.

26:15.740 --> 26:19.494
An eye for an eye
leaves the whole world blind.

26:19.577 --> 26:20.996
Riggs was a full member.

26:21.079 --> 26:22.330
That means something.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.957
Someone's got to pay.

26:24.040 --> 26:26.001
An understandable sentiment.

26:26.084 --> 26:29.796
From my vantage point,
the Seer caused the problem.

26:29.879 --> 26:32.007
Perhaps he's the solution.

26:32.590 --> 26:35.385
I'm not gonna sign off
on the death of a friend.

26:35.468 --> 26:38.221
I've had
to part company with people myself.

26:38.305 --> 26:39.556
I'm sure we all have.

26:39.639 --> 26:41.683
Peace and prosperity for all

26:41.766 --> 26:46.062
is sometimes more important
than one particular person.

26:46.563 --> 26:48.023
Alonso?

26:50.108 --> 26:51.526
Let me hear it from him.

26:51.609 --> 26:53.236
Then I'll do what needs to be done.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.988
You'll just hide him.

26:55.071 --> 26:57.991
I don't want him disappeared.
I want him dead.

26:58.074 --> 26:59.492
[Raymond] When the time comes,

26:59.576 --> 27:01.661
I'll handle the job.

27:01.745 --> 27:03.913
Does that work for both of you?

27:05.999 --> 27:07.125
All right.

27:09.961 --> 27:11.463
[Aram] Hardware told us nothing.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.381
Did you check his trace?

27:13.465 --> 27:16.051
-Why?
-The same reason you stole the phone.

27:16.134 --> 27:19.220
Don't say it was out of spite
because he's applying for your old job.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.514
It was out of spite
because he's applying for my old job.

27:21.598 --> 27:23.516
It was also
so you could check on his work,

27:23.600 --> 27:26.311
because you know
you're as good as FJ, if not better.

27:26.394 --> 27:28.688
You know he might've missed something
that you might catch.

27:28.772 --> 27:30.065
The trace was a nonstarter.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.150
Too many dummy servers
to identify the end.

27:32.233 --> 27:33.360
So he says.

27:34.361 --> 27:36.571
I'll run the trace again.
It won't lead anywhere.

27:36.654 --> 27:39.282
While you're at it,
call Nick, recommend FJ.

27:39.366 --> 27:42.160
It's the nice thing to do
and you're a nice guy.

27:42.243 --> 27:44.079
I suppose you think that's a compliment.

27:44.162 --> 27:47.999
And that it is not
FJ's fault that I took a vow of poverty.

27:48.083 --> 27:51.961
And that
if anyone else deserves the job, he does.

27:52.045 --> 27:53.338
That's exactly what I think.

27:53.421 --> 27:54.631
And despite how you feel,

27:54.714 --> 27:57.258
-I know it's what you think.
-You're right.

27:57.342 --> 27:59.761
-[Park] You'll make the call?
-Absolutely not.

27:59.844 --> 28:03.264
You're not right about how I feel.
You're absolutely wrong.

28:03.348 --> 28:06.142
What you're right about
is my running the trace.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.019
Checking his work. Look.

28:08.103 --> 28:11.439
Data packets are being sent
directly to an end server.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.274
FJ Powell is the father

28:13.358 --> 28:16.778
of modern forensic InfoSec.
He could've found this in his sleep.

28:16.861 --> 28:20.073
-Then why didn't he?
-That's the thing. I think he did.

28:22.575 --> 28:23.493
[door opens]

28:24.619 --> 28:27.122
Ah. Ms. Gilford.

28:27.205 --> 28:30.166
I've been waiting with bated breath.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.836
What tune did our songbird sing?

28:32.919 --> 28:34.587
A song of silence.

28:34.671 --> 28:35.505
-Ah.
-[Marvin] Really?

28:35.588 --> 28:37.090
I've never seen anything like it.

28:37.173 --> 28:40.218
Twenty years in hell and she's willing
to serve them all for you.

28:40.301 --> 28:44.013
The loyalty you inspire in your people.
Or is it fear?

28:44.097 --> 28:46.349
That's entirely case-dependent.

28:46.433 --> 28:48.810
In Heddie's case, it's loyalty.

28:48.893 --> 28:51.062
She has the heart of a basset hound.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.856
I'm glad she passed the test.

28:52.939 --> 28:54.065
[Kamina] What if she failed?

28:54.149 --> 28:56.276
Never told me the contingency plan.

28:56.359 --> 28:59.154
No need for unpleasant what-ifs today.

28:59.237 --> 29:01.990
The fact is Heddie stands tall.

29:02.073 --> 29:04.117
Thank you for your time.

29:04.200 --> 29:06.202
Give my regards to Judge Smathers.

29:06.286 --> 29:08.872
And I hope
your new bungalow on Sint Maarten

29:08.955 --> 29:11.499
is everything you've always dreamed of.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.334
Best afternoon's work I've ever done.

29:13.418 --> 29:16.254
I would agree.
The gentleman who brought you here

29:16.337 --> 29:18.506
is waiting
to take you wherever you'd like.

29:18.590 --> 29:19.424
Thank you.

29:21.134 --> 29:23.511
Heddie has a rough road ahead.

29:23.595 --> 29:24.929
I'll make some calls.

29:25.013 --> 29:27.557
See that she gets the best bunk.

29:27.640 --> 29:30.143
Limitless commissary account.

29:30.226 --> 29:32.395
That won't be necessary, Marvin.

29:32.479 --> 29:35.982
I'd say Heddie's
earned her freedom, wouldn't you?

29:36.065 --> 29:39.944
I know you're good,
but the woman's in a federal holding cell.

29:40.028 --> 29:42.697
What, are you planning
on staging a breakout?

29:42.781 --> 29:44.783
In a manner of speaking, yes.

29:53.541 --> 29:54.876
[cell phone ringing]

29:56.461 --> 29:57.295
Hello, Alonso.

29:57.378 --> 30:01.341
You killed a full member
of the Mount Porte Motorcycle Club?

30:01.424 --> 30:02.801
What were you thinking?

30:02.884 --> 30:05.345
The FBI was on its way
to question him about Arcane.

30:05.428 --> 30:06.679
You should have come to me.

30:06.763 --> 30:08.097
<i>I don't work for you.</i>

30:08.181 --> 30:10.475
Only because I allowed you to go.

30:10.558 --> 30:13.603
<i>You operate under my protection.</i>
<i>Don't forget.</i>

30:13.686 --> 30:16.648
I introduced you to many of your clients.

30:16.731 --> 30:18.817
Nobody even knew
who you were two years ago.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.902
I think sharing half my profits

30:20.985 --> 30:23.696
expresses the appropriate
amount of appreciation.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.533
Profits that might have disappeared
if the FBI got Riggs.

30:26.616 --> 30:27.575
<i>You crossed a line.</i>

30:27.659 --> 30:31.746
I'm staring down a war
with a dangerous enemy.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.039
We need to fix this.

30:33.122 --> 30:35.667
When and where can we meet to discuss?

30:35.750 --> 30:37.585
I'm on my way to close a deal.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.587
Rock Creek Park in 45 minutes.

30:39.671 --> 30:40.755
<i>We can talk after.</i>

30:40.839 --> 30:41.673
I'll be there.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.552
Make it as quick as possible.

30:45.635 --> 30:46.928
Don't let him suffer.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.180
He won't feel a thing.

30:59.774 --> 31:01.234
[cell phone chiming]

31:03.486 --> 31:04.821
-Cooper.
-Harold.

31:04.904 --> 31:06.364
I have a time and place.

31:15.498 --> 31:17.125
What am I missing?

31:18.877 --> 31:19.711
Manners?

31:19.794 --> 31:22.338
You always said
it wasn't enough to see only the code.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.591
To be great,
you need to see the big picture.

31:24.674 --> 31:25.675
I can't see it.

31:25.758 --> 31:27.093
Or I don't want to.

31:27.176 --> 31:31.389
Because the only big picture I see
is that you're a traitor.

31:31.472 --> 31:33.099
A convenient accusation

31:33.182 --> 31:37.687
as even uttering it might prevent me
from getting your old job.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.272
That has nothing to do with this.

31:39.355 --> 31:41.190
But you don't want me to get it, do you?

31:41.274 --> 31:44.986
What I want is for you to tell me,
why didn't you run the trace?

31:45.069 --> 31:48.197
Is that what you want,
or is that an order?

31:48.281 --> 31:50.867
Both. If you don't believe me,
call the boss.

31:50.950 --> 31:52.076
I don't need to.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.745
I know what she would say.

31:53.828 --> 31:54.662
So do I.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.247
That I should arrest you.

31:56.331 --> 31:59.459
Actually, she would curse
your infernal meddling

31:59.542 --> 32:02.462
and then grant me permission
to read you in

32:02.545 --> 32:06.215
hoping to prevent you
from causing any lasting damage.

32:06.299 --> 32:10.053
The only thing I'm trying to damage
is the Arcane Network.

32:10.136 --> 32:13.222
And by doing that, you damage the country.

32:13.306 --> 32:14.724
You think I'm a traitor.

32:14.807 --> 32:17.018
But if you saw the big picture...

32:17.977 --> 32:20.355
you'd see that I'm a patriot.

32:20.438 --> 32:23.524
Yes. I've been protecting
the Arcane Network.

32:24.150 --> 32:27.070
Because I created it.

32:35.203 --> 32:37.288
Got eyes on the target. Perimeter secure.

32:37.372 --> 32:39.874
Standby. Let's see who he's meeting first.

32:51.219 --> 32:52.303
Who's the unsub?

32:52.387 --> 32:53.972
Odin Interdonato.

32:54.055 --> 32:55.807
Head of a human trafficking operation.

32:55.890 --> 32:58.101
The largest trafficking operation
in the country.

32:58.184 --> 33:00.436
He's destroyed thousands of lives.

33:00.520 --> 33:04.691
If he starts using the Seer's phone,
his operation goes invisible.

33:04.774 --> 33:06.693
We move in now, we take them both down.

33:06.776 --> 33:08.528
You're all clear. Do it.

33:08.611 --> 33:09.445
<i>Go.</i>

33:09.529 --> 33:10.822
[dramatic music playing]

33:19.330 --> 33:20.957
Sir. Shut it down.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.083
It's the FBI.

33:22.166 --> 33:24.419
-What's the FBI?
-The Seer. Arcane Wireless.

33:24.502 --> 33:25.420
It's all an op.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.505
The Seer, he's a deep cover agent.

33:27.588 --> 33:28.715
He's one of us.

33:28.798 --> 33:32.552
-Agent Ressler. Agent Zuma. Pull back.
-[Ressler] <i>Negative. Target is engaging.</i>

33:32.635 --> 33:35.054
Get on the ground! Get on the ground!

33:35.888 --> 33:37.473
-Hands!
-Don't move.

33:38.808 --> 33:40.893
You have no idea what you just did.

33:40.977 --> 33:42.395
Save it for the judge.

33:42.478 --> 33:43.730
We had one chance.

33:43.813 --> 33:45.314
One. And you ruined it.

33:54.407 --> 33:56.409
Interdonato is dead.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.836
You had no authority
to move in on my operation.

34:06.919 --> 34:09.005
You were making a deal
with a human trafficker.

34:09.088 --> 34:11.674
You think I was making a deal?
Give me one of my phones.

34:11.758 --> 34:14.802
See if I can spell this out
for the nosebleed seats.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.471
Criminals make a call.

34:16.554 --> 34:17.638
Totally encrypted,

34:17.722 --> 34:21.267
not identifiable by any traditional method
of forensic wiretapping.

34:21.350 --> 34:23.603
-It was keeping arrests down.
-[Seer] For now.

34:23.686 --> 34:26.522
Short-term concession for long-term gain.

34:26.606 --> 34:29.859
What our clients didn't know
is that every one of their conversations

34:29.942 --> 34:32.945
was recorded
and sent back to our server farm.

34:33.029 --> 34:34.989
I wasn't aiding Odin Interdonato.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.657
I was bugging him.

34:36.741 --> 34:40.953
I had convinced him to use our phones
exclusively to run his operations.

34:41.037 --> 34:43.498
Thousands of criminals around the world.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.583
Know how much work went into this?

34:46.084 --> 34:47.710
Millions of dollars in R&amp;D.

34:47.794 --> 34:50.713
I spent years developing
my criminal bonafides

34:50.797 --> 34:53.341
and you rush in like John Wayne's cavalry

34:53.424 --> 34:55.802
after two days of recon
and shoot up the place.

34:55.885 --> 34:57.095
What about Riggs?

34:57.178 --> 34:58.888
You killed him to protect your cover.

34:58.971 --> 35:00.473
Killed? No.

35:00.556 --> 35:04.227
FJ heard you were nosing around.
I arrested Riggs before you could get him.

35:04.310 --> 35:07.146
He's in a safe house. We were done anyway.

35:07.230 --> 35:10.608
We'd gotten intel on their shipment
so we busted the lights on their truck.

35:10.691 --> 35:12.693
Gave Highway Patrol
reason to pull them over.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.403
DA was taking it over from there.

35:14.487 --> 35:17.115
Why didn't someone
notify us to stand down?

35:17.198 --> 35:20.618
We would have if FJ could have determined
who Agent Mojtabai worked for.

35:20.701 --> 35:23.329
But apparently that's a well-kept secret.

35:31.462 --> 35:32.547
I am sorry.

35:33.339 --> 35:34.340
For what?

35:35.299 --> 35:39.303
Saying sorry is meaningless
unless you say what you're sorry for.

35:40.096 --> 35:41.931
It's a pretty long list.

35:42.014 --> 35:44.350
I'm sorry for messing up the op.

35:44.433 --> 35:46.978
The phones you created,
they are incredible.

35:47.061 --> 35:49.730
I honestly don't know how you did it.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.732
They could have been used
for so much good.

35:51.816 --> 35:54.694
I'm sorry that we messed that up.

35:55.528 --> 35:57.572
You should be sorry about that.

35:59.532 --> 36:00.616
Anything else?

36:01.701 --> 36:03.786
Sorry I thought you were a traitor?

36:03.870 --> 36:05.580
Yeah, that's two things.

36:06.622 --> 36:07.748
What else?

36:09.000 --> 36:11.627
Resenting you
for wanting to take my old job.

36:13.796 --> 36:14.630
And?

36:14.714 --> 36:15.673
There's more.

36:15.756 --> 36:16.883
What...?

36:16.966 --> 36:18.968
I don't know. My very existence?

36:19.051 --> 36:20.094
Hmm.

36:21.053 --> 36:23.014
You don't owe me another apology.

36:23.097 --> 36:25.433
But you do owe one to yourself.

36:26.350 --> 36:29.645
You are a smart young man
with a bright future.

36:29.729 --> 36:32.023
What I created at the Arcane Network

36:32.106 --> 36:36.903
is no more impressive
than what you created at Greylock.

36:36.986 --> 36:38.946
I've been asked
to join dozens of startups.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.115
Each more pedestrian than the next.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.242
But what you created here...

36:44.660 --> 36:46.329
it's inspired.

36:46.913 --> 36:49.081
Which makes me think
that what you're doing here

36:49.165 --> 36:51.125
is also inspired.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.920
Or you wouldn't be here and not there.

36:54.003 --> 36:54.879
So...

36:56.589 --> 36:59.842
forgive yourself
for the choices that you have made.

37:00.885 --> 37:02.637
As far as I can tell,

37:02.720 --> 37:03.763
my friend...

37:05.598 --> 37:07.225
they're the right ones.

37:09.268 --> 37:11.062
[Seer] <i>The sky was the limit.</i>

37:11.145 --> 37:12.688
Odin was our latest prize,

37:12.772 --> 37:15.024
but we had our eyes fixed
on an even bigger fish.

37:15.107 --> 37:17.193
Number one on the Most Wanted list.

37:18.569 --> 37:19.737
Raymond Reddington.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.323
You were targeting him.

37:22.406 --> 37:25.117
We'd slipped a few phones into his ranks.

37:25.201 --> 37:26.202
Taking him down

37:26.285 --> 37:28.829
was one of the main priorities
of the wide release.

37:28.913 --> 37:31.249
We'll never know
what we could've accomplished.

37:35.002 --> 37:37.922
[Cooper]
<i>This was all about protecting you.</i>

37:38.005 --> 37:39.632
Guess you've spoken with the Seer.

37:39.715 --> 37:43.427
Yeah. It became abundantly clear
this was about saving your ass.

37:43.511 --> 37:46.264
We're each looking out for own interests,

37:46.347 --> 37:48.975
operating according to our own principles.

37:49.058 --> 37:51.394
When those interests align, so be it.

37:51.477 --> 37:52.561
Today they didn't.

37:52.645 --> 37:55.898
That task force was conducting
a years-long surveillance operation.

37:55.982 --> 37:57.900
<i>And look how well it worked out.</i>

37:57.984 --> 37:59.902
Odin Interdonato is dead.

37:59.986 --> 38:05.491
And ongoing intel gathered
by whatever's left of the Arcane Network

38:05.574 --> 38:09.412
will lead to the arrests
of Alonso Lyon and Clyde MacFarlane

38:09.495 --> 38:10.830
and who knows how many more.

38:10.913 --> 38:13.708
A vacuum you'll have no trouble filling.

38:13.791 --> 38:16.585
Not interested.
I've got other fish to fry.

38:21.590 --> 38:26.470
Hey. I do not appreciate you making
an end-run around my representation.

38:29.015 --> 38:29.849
Excuse us.

38:31.934 --> 38:35.229
People have the right
to an attorney, not a mouthpiece.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.731
-I tried to get her one.
-Yeah?

38:36.814 --> 38:39.817
An attorney who will get Heddie
to do what you want.

38:39.900 --> 38:42.069
It doesn't really matter, does it?

38:42.153 --> 38:45.031
Reddington got his way. You're a disgrace.

38:45.114 --> 38:45.948
Am I?

38:46.032 --> 38:47.283
How do you figure?

38:47.366 --> 38:49.535
Ms. Hawkins turned down the deal.

38:49.618 --> 38:52.246
For the next 20 years,
every time you see your boss' face,

38:52.330 --> 38:56.542
I hope you think about that misguided,
manipulated woman rotting in prison.

38:56.625 --> 38:57.710
Yeah. Uh...

38:58.419 --> 38:59.253
No.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.922
That is not gonna happen.

39:02.006 --> 39:05.134
-You're not gonna think of her?
-No. She's not going to prison.

39:07.053 --> 39:11.515
What do you know
about the Arcane Wireless Network?

39:12.350 --> 39:13.267
Nothing?

39:13.351 --> 39:17.772
Well, tell your superiors all it will take
are a few well-placed phone calls

39:17.855 --> 39:22.151
to spread the word
to every drug runner, gangster, and conman

39:22.234 --> 39:25.029
who are still
in possession of an Arcane phone

39:25.112 --> 39:27.323
that they are bugged

39:27.406 --> 39:31.327
by the very same people
that they are supposed to be invisible to.

39:31.994 --> 39:33.871
I don't know what you're talking about.

39:33.954 --> 39:36.040
I do know this isn't a negotiation.

39:36.123 --> 39:37.083
No, it isn't.

39:37.166 --> 39:38.709
Not between the two of us.

39:38.793 --> 39:43.672
The next time you hear about this,
it will come from someone high up.

39:43.756 --> 39:46.050
And when that happens,
let me tell you something,

39:46.133 --> 39:51.055
the only way that you are going to stop
a mountain of failed hopes and dreams

39:51.138 --> 39:54.058
from coming tumbling down on you

39:54.141 --> 39:56.519
is gonna be when you set my client free.

39:57.645 --> 39:58.646
Got that?

40:04.402 --> 40:06.112
Hey, Chloe.

40:08.114 --> 40:09.698
Yeah, I heard.

40:09.782 --> 40:11.117
Nineteen million.

40:11.992 --> 40:14.412
Yeah, that's great. That's great news.

40:15.454 --> 40:16.872
Come to the celebration?

40:16.956 --> 40:18.165
No.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.083
I don't know.

40:20.626 --> 40:21.836
In Tahiti?

40:22.670 --> 40:24.839
On a private jet? Oh.

40:24.922 --> 40:26.799
No, I'm good.

40:26.882 --> 40:28.843
Yeah, no, I'm positive.

40:28.926 --> 40:30.177
Listen. Um--

40:30.261 --> 40:31.887
Is Nick still around?

40:32.680 --> 40:35.141
No. No, that's okay. Just, um...

40:37.518 --> 40:41.480
Just tell him I sent over a résumé
for someone to take my old job.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.526
Yeah, he's gonna wanna hire this guy.

40:47.445 --> 40:48.279
He's awesome.

40:50.656 --> 40:52.074
[Heddie] My hero.

40:52.158 --> 40:52.992
Heddie.

40:53.075 --> 40:54.618
Come in, my dear.

40:55.411 --> 40:56.328
Thank you.

40:56.412 --> 40:58.414
Oh. No. Thank you.

40:58.497 --> 40:59.874
Please. Have a seat.

40:59.957 --> 41:02.209
Thank you for getting me out. I...

41:03.627 --> 41:05.463
I am so sorry.

41:05.546 --> 41:07.798
It was the phones, Heddie, not you.

41:09.091 --> 41:11.927
So how do you know
they won't be a problem going forward?

41:12.011 --> 41:13.262
It's been taken care of.

41:13.345 --> 41:16.265
You should know
that I was approached by a lawyer.

41:16.348 --> 41:18.559
Bloodsucker wanted me to turn on you.

41:18.642 --> 41:19.977
Yes, I know.

41:20.060 --> 41:21.896
Ms. Gilford is my bloodsucker,

41:21.979 --> 41:24.815
along with the judge
who assigned her to your case.

41:24.899 --> 41:28.319
Wait, you sent her in
to see if I was loyal to you?

41:28.402 --> 41:30.154
Kind of like a test?

41:30.237 --> 41:32.448
A pass or die test?

41:32.531 --> 41:33.782
I'm sorry, Heddie.

41:33.866 --> 41:37.286
Tests have always made my nerves whacky.

41:37.369 --> 41:39.413
They're the reason
I dropped out of high school.

41:39.497 --> 41:40.998
I barely passed the GEDs.

41:41.081 --> 41:42.333
And the CPA?

41:42.416 --> 41:45.628
I spent more time in the bathroom
than I did on the worksheets.

41:45.711 --> 41:48.380
If I had known
that you were giving me a test,

41:48.464 --> 41:49.840
I probably would have flunked.

41:49.924 --> 41:51.342
But instead--

41:51.425 --> 41:53.677
You passed with flying colors.

41:53.761 --> 41:57.139
I'd offer you
an alcoholic beverage to celebrate,

41:57.223 --> 42:00.142
but I seem to recall
you have a taste for--

42:00.226 --> 42:01.227
Yerba mate?

42:01.310 --> 42:04.230
Did I show you the ritual
when you were last here?

42:04.313 --> 42:07.691
-No.
-It's one meant to be shared with friends.

42:08.984 --> 42:10.069
A gourd.

42:11.237 --> 42:12.655
The leaves.

42:19.203 --> 42:20.579
[theme music playing]
