28:51.062 --> 28:52.772
We're in
the wrong position.

28:55.650 --> 28:57.444
We're in
the wrong position.

28:57.527 --> 28:59.654
We're textbook position
for ambush, sir.

28:59.737 --> 29:01.114
We should sit tight,

29:01.197 --> 29:03.199
let the enemy team come
into our killing zone.

29:03.283 --> 29:05.827
They're right out
there somewhere.
Let's just get 'em.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.371
Sir, we have
perfect cover here.

29:08.455 --> 29:10.331
Lieutenant,
deploy your troops.

29:13.084 --> 29:15.503
2nd Platoon,
move out.

29:16.421 --> 29:17.380
What?

29:16.421 --> 29:17.380
Tactical column.

29:37.984 --> 29:39.360
Captain, you've
just been killed,

29:39.444 --> 29:42.113
along with 95 percent
of your company.

29:42.197 --> 29:43.448
Your outfit?

29:44.574 --> 29:47.202
Easy Company,
2nd battalion 506th.

29:50.955 --> 29:52.999
Man:
Leave three wounded men
on the ground

29:53.082 --> 29:55.793
and report back
to the assembly area.

29:55.877 --> 29:58.254
(mutters)
Goddammit.

30:03.009 --> 30:04.469
You, you, you.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.183
Well, what are
you gonna do?

30:10.266 --> 30:12.435
Nothing, just keep
training the men.

30:13.895 --> 30:14.979
Am I interrupting?

30:17.232 --> 30:19.108
No, no.

30:19.192 --> 30:20.276
Lieutenant Lewis Nixon.

30:20.360 --> 30:23.446
Lieutenant Harry Welsh,
just in from the 82nd.

30:23.530 --> 30:24.948
Congratulations
on the promotion.

30:25.031 --> 30:27.283
Ah, thanks, if you
wanna call it that.

30:27.367 --> 30:28.868
You'll learn him
pretty quickly--

30:28.952 --> 30:32.080
no flaws, no vices,
no sense of humor.

30:32.163 --> 30:34.958
Just like your chums
up at Battalion staff.

30:36.125 --> 30:38.002
What's up?

30:38.086 --> 30:39.671
I'm hearing a lot
of rumblings.

30:39.754 --> 30:41.047
Sobel?

30:39.754 --> 30:41.047
Mmm.

30:41.130 --> 30:43.091
Just talking
about that.

30:43.174 --> 30:46.261
So, he gets a little
jumpy in the field?

30:43.174 --> 30:46.261
Hmm-mmm.

30:46.344 --> 30:48.096
He gets jumpy
and then you get killed.

30:48.179 --> 30:49.764
That's nice.

30:49.847 --> 30:52.100
Yeah, listen,
if we discuss it,

30:52.183 --> 30:53.685
I think it should just
be amongst ourselves.

30:53.768 --> 30:54.936
Oh, absolutely.

31:03.319 --> 31:04.571
2nd Platoon ready?

31:04.654 --> 31:06.781
Ready, sir.

31:06.864 --> 31:09.242
Then get them
in formation.
We're moving out.

31:10.577 --> 31:11.703
Yes, sir.

31:25.216 --> 31:28.595
(chattering)

31:32.390 --> 31:34.601
(laughing)

31:36.311 --> 31:37.437
Toye:
Shut up, Cobb.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.439
Eh, you gotta
admit it.

31:39.522 --> 31:40.898
He's got
no chance.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.900
Either the Krauts
will get him,

31:42.984 --> 31:44.569
or one of us.

31:44.652 --> 31:46.404
Liebgott:
Who, Sobel?

31:47.530 --> 31:49.157
He screwed up
one maneuver.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.618
Well, you know, I'm always
fumbling with grenades.

31:51.701 --> 31:54.454
It would be easy if one went
off by accident, you know?

31:54.537 --> 31:58.374
Well, now,
they must have put him
in charge for a reason.

31:58.458 --> 32:01.628
Yeah, 'cause the army wouldn't
make a mistake, right, Shift?

32:17.268 --> 32:18.436
Going my way?

32:18.519 --> 32:20.021
Wherever the train
takes me.

32:20.104 --> 32:21.272
Where do you suppose
that might be?

32:21.356 --> 32:23.483
I haven't got a clue.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.483
Yeah, c'mon, take a guess.

32:23.566 --> 32:26.569
Atlantic, Pacific,
Atlantic?

32:26.653 --> 32:28.613
I'm not
the intelligence officer.

32:28.696 --> 32:29.822
Mmm.

32:29.906 --> 32:33.242
Well, as such,
I of course know,
but if I told you,

32:33.326 --> 32:35.244
I'd have to kill you.

32:33.326 --> 32:35.244
So, don't tell me.

32:39.582 --> 32:40.500
New York City.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.919
Troop ship.
England.

32:45.838 --> 32:48.007
We're invading Europe,
my friend.

32:49.175 --> 32:50.635
Fortress Europa.

32:52.637 --> 32:54.263
Since when
do I drink?

32:56.307 --> 32:58.726
If I thought you'd drink it,
I wouldn't offer it to you.

33:01.688 --> 33:02.730
Nix?

33:02.814 --> 33:05.233
What are you gonna do
when you get into combat?

33:07.777 --> 33:10.863
Oh, I have every confidence
in my scrounging abilities.

33:12.115 --> 33:15.702
And I have a case of Vat 69
hidden in your footlocker.

33:15.785 --> 33:17.954
(laughs)

33:20.415 --> 33:22.667
Really?

33:20.415 --> 33:22.667
Oh, yeah.

33:24.502 --> 33:25.545
Morning.

33:26.838 --> 33:27.672
Mmm.

33:27.755 --> 33:30.133
This could turn into
a real nice trip.

33:35.847 --> 33:38.349
<i>(clicking)</i>

33:40.351 --> 33:43.438
<i>(ship bell dings)</i>

33:43.521 --> 33:45.523
(chattering)

33:46.649 --> 33:48.818
Sobel:
<i>"Dear sir or madam,</i>

33:48.901 --> 33:51.070
<i>"soon your son will</i>
<i>drop from the sky</i>

33:51.154 --> 33:54.365
<i>"to engage</i>

(boat horn blares)

34:27.440 --> 34:30.151
Muck:
Right now,
some lucky bastard's headed

34:30.234 --> 34:32.320
for the South Pacific.
Oh, what I would give.

34:32.403 --> 34:34.447
He's gonna get billeted
on some tropical island...

34:34.530 --> 34:38.493
Malarkey: Keep talking.

34:34.530 --> 34:38.493
...sitting under a palm tree
with six naked native girls...

34:38.576 --> 34:40.244
Oh yeah.

34:38.576 --> 34:40.244
...helping him
cut up coconuts,

34:40.328 --> 34:43.122
so he can hand-feed 'em
to the flamingos.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.957
Flamingos are mean.

34:45.041 --> 34:46.417
They bite.

34:46.501 --> 34:48.211
So do the naked
native girls.

34:48.294 --> 34:49.337
With any luck.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.672
Hey, guys, I'm glad
I'm going to Europe.

34:51.756 --> 34:54.842
Hitler gets one of these
right across the windpipe.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.845
Roosevelt changes Thanksgiving
to Joe Toye Day,

34:57.929 --> 35:01.891
and pays me 10 grand
a year for the rest
of my fucking life.

35:01.974 --> 35:04.101
What if we don't
get to Europe?

35:04.185 --> 35:06.187
What if they send us
to North Africa?

35:06.270 --> 35:07.480
My brother's
in North Africa.

35:07.563 --> 35:10.608
He says it's hot.

35:07.563 --> 35:10.608
Really, it's hot in Africa?

35:10.691 --> 35:12.026
Shut up.

35:12.109 --> 35:13.653
The point is, it don't
matter where we go.

35:13.736 --> 35:16.114
Once we get into combat,
the only person you can trust

35:16.197 --> 35:18.324
is yourself and the fella
next to you.

35:18.407 --> 35:21.327
Hey, as long as
he's a paratrooper.

35:21.410 --> 35:25.456
Oh, yeah?
And what if that paratrooper
turns out to be Sobel?

35:25.540 --> 35:29.168
If I'm next to Sobel
in combat, I'm moving
on down the line.

35:29.252 --> 35:30.920
Hook up with
some other officer,

35:31.003 --> 35:33.172
like Heyliger
or Winters.

35:33.256 --> 35:35.049
I like Winters,
he's a good man.

35:35.132 --> 35:36.717
But when the bullets
start flying,

35:36.801 --> 35:39.512
I don't know
if I want a Quaker
doing my fighting for me.

35:39.595 --> 35:41.722
Muck:
How do you know
he's a Quaker?

35:41.806 --> 35:43.558
He ain't Catholic.

35:43.641 --> 35:44.559
Malarkey:
Neither's Sobel.

35:44.642 --> 35:46.519
That prick's
the son of Abraham.

35:47.645 --> 35:48.604
He's what?

35:48.688 --> 35:50.565
He's a Jew.

35:50.648 --> 35:52.024
(mutters)

35:54.569 --> 35:55.695
I'm a Jew.

35:55.778 --> 35:57.446
Congratulations.

35:57.530 --> 35:59.782
Get your nose
out of my face.

36:00.783 --> 36:02.869
(men shouting)

36:07.248 --> 36:08.541
What's all
that about?

36:09.458 --> 36:11.294
Gonorrhea called
Sobel a Jew.

36:11.377 --> 36:13.546
Liebgott took offense
'cause he's a Jew too.

36:13.629 --> 36:14.714
Pfft!

36:15.590 --> 36:18.426
Fighting over Sobel,
that's smart.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.892
(birds chirping)

36:36.277 --> 36:37.194
Man: Attack!

36:37.278 --> 36:39.572
(men shouting, grunting)

36:41.407 --> 36:43.826
No, you wanna
kill him!

36:43.910 --> 36:45.870
Man 2:
Parry right,
parry left.

36:45.953 --> 36:47.413
Thrust!

36:47.496 --> 36:48.748
Take cover.

36:48.831 --> 36:50.249
Okay.
(clears throat)

36:50.333 --> 36:54.128
Yesterday, we talked about
magnetic declination

36:54.211 --> 36:56.672
and the left add,
right subtract rule.

36:56.756 --> 36:58.090
Today we're gonna
put it into practice.

36:58.174 --> 37:01.677
There are two basic types
of fighting positions.

37:01.761 --> 37:04.263
The first is
the prepared position.

37:04.347 --> 37:06.641
The advantages
of a prepared position

37:06.724 --> 37:10.019
are that it gives you
cover and concealment.

37:10.102 --> 37:11.604
Sink:
<i>Commence fire!</i>

37:16.233 --> 37:18.945
We'll then maneuver,
right in through these trees.

37:19.028 --> 37:21.364
At the same time,
our 2nd Platoon,

37:21.447 --> 37:24.075
in this particular case,
moves over here.

37:24.158 --> 37:27.662
He's then gonna close
with and kill or capture
that German.

37:45.304 --> 37:47.807
(panting)

37:52.687 --> 37:54.063
Sobel's late.

38:06.367 --> 38:07.743
Why is there
a fence here?

38:10.788 --> 38:12.164
There should be
no fence here.

38:12.248 --> 38:13.541
Tipper!

38:12.248 --> 38:13.541
Yes, sir.

38:13.624 --> 38:14.709
Give me the map.

38:18.045 --> 38:19.213
Perconte, Luz.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.549
Get the men,
get 'em b--

38:21.632 --> 38:23.217
take cover behind
those trees.

38:23.300 --> 38:25.011
Luz: Alright,
you heard the word.

38:23.300 --> 38:25.011
Perconte: Yes, sir.

38:25.094 --> 38:26.971
Let's go. Move it out, fellas.

38:25.094 --> 38:26.971
You heard him. Move out.

38:30.057 --> 38:32.059
There should be no--
there should be no fence here.

38:32.143 --> 38:35.396
Um...
(clearing throat)
we could go over it, sir.

38:35.479 --> 38:38.691
Really? That's not the point!
Where are the goddamn--

38:38.774 --> 38:40.735
(softly)
where the goddamn
hell are we?

38:43.195 --> 38:44.196
Perconte?

38:43.195 --> 38:44.196
Yeah.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.448
Sobel's lost again,
right?

38:45.531 --> 38:46.490
Yeah, he's lost.

38:46.574 --> 38:47.825
Fucking Christ.

38:47.908 --> 38:49.243
Luz!

38:51.996 --> 38:54.457
Can you do
Major Horton?

38:54.540 --> 38:57.543
(mimics Horton)
Does a wild bear crap
in the woods, son?

38:57.626 --> 39:00.504
Shh, shh, shh.
Maybe the good major
can goose this schmuck.

39:00.588 --> 39:03.257
Get us moving?

39:00.588 --> 39:03.257
(normal voice)
No way.

39:03.340 --> 39:04.592
Oh yeah, yes.

39:04.675 --> 39:06.927
You gotta,
you gotta. C'mon.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.721
Alright,
just this once.

39:08.804 --> 39:11.265
Shh, shh.

39:14.351 --> 39:17.396
Three, five,
six, eight, three, three.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.815
Isn't that
the intersection?

39:17.480 --> 39:19.815
No, sir, it's here.

39:19.899 --> 39:21.233
You're a full
grid off.

39:21.317 --> 39:23.402
(mutters)
Goddammit.

39:23.486 --> 39:26.155
(Luz mimics Horton)
Is there a problem,
Captain Sobel?

39:26.238 --> 39:29.408
Who said that?
Who broke silence?

39:29.492 --> 39:31.494
I think it's
Major Horton, sir.

39:34.163 --> 39:35.081
Major Horton?

39:35.164 --> 39:37.083
What is he--
did he join us?

39:37.166 --> 39:40.127
I think maybe he's moving
between the platoons, sir.

39:40.211 --> 39:44.215
What is the goddamn
holdup, Mr. Sobel?

39:40.211 --> 39:44.215
(men chuckling)

39:46.425 --> 39:47.885
A fence, sir.

39:47.968 --> 39:49.428
Um, God.

39:50.387 --> 39:51.722
A barbed wire fence.

39:51.806 --> 39:54.642
Luz:
Oh, that dog
just ain't gonna hunt.

39:54.725 --> 39:56.393
(stifled laughter)

39:54.725 --> 39:56.393
(normal voice)
Shut it! Shh, shh!

39:56.477 --> 39:59.855
(mimics Horton)
Now, you cut that fence
and get this goddamn platoon

39:59.939 --> 40:00.981
on the move!

40:02.483 --> 40:03.567
Yes, sir!

40:06.403 --> 40:08.114
Where are my goddamn
wire cutters?

40:10.741 --> 40:11.826
We have to move.

40:11.909 --> 40:14.578
Sir, without Captain Sobel
and 1st platoon?

40:14.662 --> 40:17.373
It's a "T" intersection.
We improvise.

40:17.456 --> 40:20.209
Double envelopment,
lay down a base of fire

40:20.292 --> 40:21.877
to cut the road
in all directions.

40:21.961 --> 40:23.754
Hook right
with 1st squad.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.714
Tell Guarnere to
move left with 2nd.

40:25.798 --> 40:27.007
I'll be right up
the middle with 3rd.

40:27.091 --> 40:28.551
Go.

40:27.091 --> 40:28.551
Yes, sir.

40:51.407 --> 40:52.700
Deary me.

40:55.536 --> 40:58.414
(dog barking)

41:03.752 --> 41:05.212
Bloody hell.

41:25.107 --> 41:27.026
You've done
it now, yanks.

41:27.109 --> 41:28.944
You've captured me.

41:32.698 --> 41:36.660
Sobel:
Hi-ho, Silver!

41:39.288 --> 41:40.789
Would that be
the enemy?

41:41.832 --> 41:43.709
As a matter
of fact, yes.

41:51.759 --> 41:53.052
Good work,
2nd platoon.

41:53.135 --> 41:54.553
We took
the objective.

42:03.646 --> 42:06.899
Strayer:
<i>Who is the idiot</i>
<i>who cut that man's fence?</i>

42:06.982 --> 42:08.234
Sobel:
<i>I was ordered to, sir.</i>

42:08.317 --> 42:10.361
By whom?

42:08.317 --> 42:10.361
Major Horton, sir.

42:10.444 --> 42:11.904
Major Horton?

42:10.444 --> 42:11.904
Yes, sir.

42:11.987 --> 42:14.490
Major Horton
told you to do that?

42:11.987 --> 42:14.490
Yes, sir.

42:14.573 --> 42:17.576
Major Horton ordered you
to cut the fence?

42:17.660 --> 42:19.703
Yes, he did.

42:19.787 --> 42:23.499
Major Horton
is on leave in London.

42:26.043 --> 42:27.878
Get those cows
out of here.

42:32.508 --> 42:36.887
Your left, your left,
your left, right, left.

42:36.971 --> 42:39.306
Your left, your left,

42:39.390 --> 42:41.642
your left, right, left.

42:56.865 --> 42:58.033
Lieutenant Winters.

43:01.578 --> 43:03.580
With Captain Sobel's
compliments, sir.

43:07.251 --> 43:08.419
Lieutenant.

43:07.251 --> 43:08.419
Mmm.

43:27.521 --> 43:29.023
Oh, for crying
out loud.

43:29.106 --> 43:30.816
Misspelled "court-martial."

43:30.899 --> 43:33.319
Wide open!

43:30.899 --> 43:33.319
Yes!

43:37.323 --> 43:38.991
No, sir,
I do not understand.

43:39.074 --> 43:41.660
Your orders to me were
to inspect the latrines

43:41.744 --> 43:42.953
at 1000 hours.

43:43.037 --> 43:46.790
From 0930 to 0955
I was censoring
the enlisted men's mail

43:46.874 --> 43:49.543
by order
of Colonel Strayer.

43:49.626 --> 43:52.629
At 1000 hours I followed
your orders to the minute.

43:52.713 --> 43:55.341
I changed that time
to 0945.

43:55.424 --> 43:57.509
No one told me, sir.

43:55.424 --> 43:57.509
I telephoned.

43:57.593 --> 44:00.054
I'm quartered with a family
that has no telephone.

44:00.137 --> 44:01.555
And sent a runner.

44:01.638 --> 44:03.057
No runner found me,
Captain.

44:03.140 --> 44:06.852
Irregardless,
when given a task to perform
by a ranking officer,

44:06.935 --> 44:08.270
you should have delegated

44:08.354 --> 44:10.189
your task
of latrine inspection

44:10.272 --> 44:11.523
to another officer.

44:11.607 --> 44:13.192
You failed to do so.

44:13.275 --> 44:17.112
Were I to let
such a failure of duty
by my own XO go unpunished,

44:17.196 --> 44:18.947
what kind of message
is that to the men?

44:19.031 --> 44:21.742
I performed my duty
as I was ordered, sir.

44:21.825 --> 44:23.369
And I disagree.

44:23.452 --> 44:27.164
So, your options are
quite simple, Lieutenant.

44:27.247 --> 44:30.084
Punishment for your offenses
will be denial

44:30.167 --> 44:32.461
of a 48-hour pass
for 60 days.

44:32.544 --> 44:34.296
Stand before me
at attention.

44:37.800 --> 44:40.094
Or you may initiate
a letter of appeal

44:40.177 --> 44:42.179
and request a trial
by court-martial.

44:47.226 --> 44:48.936
You spend your weekends
on the base anyway, Dick.

44:49.019 --> 44:50.646
Be a man,
take the punishment.

44:52.523 --> 44:54.441
May I borrow
your pen, sir?

45:06.203 --> 45:07.830
My endorsement, sir.

45:09.748 --> 45:11.667
I request trial
by court-martial.

45:23.220 --> 45:25.139
We lost Winters
to battalion mess.

45:25.222 --> 45:26.640
You're shitting me.

45:26.723 --> 45:30.144
No. Strayer did it,
while they try to figure out
the procedures

45:30.227 --> 45:31.353
for his court-martial.

45:31.437 --> 45:33.730
Well, Nixon better find
a loophole and get him out.

45:33.814 --> 45:34.940
And if he don't?

45:35.023 --> 45:36.150
Winters scrambles eggs

45:36.233 --> 45:38.569
while the rest of us make
the big jump with Sobel.

45:40.612 --> 45:42.614
Not me.

45:42.698 --> 45:44.199
So we're going through
with this, right?

45:45.200 --> 45:46.743
We've gotta
do something.

45:46.827 --> 45:48.120
Yeah.

45:48.203 --> 45:50.205
Yeah.

45:48.203 --> 45:50.205
Alright.

45:51.665 --> 45:52.708
Good.

45:54.751 --> 45:56.628
But we'd all better be clear
of the consequences.

45:56.712 --> 45:58.213
I don't care about
the consequences.

45:58.297 --> 46:02.593
Johnny... we could be lined up
against a wall and shot.

46:05.095 --> 46:06.847
Now, I'm ready
to face that.

46:08.765 --> 46:10.809
And every one of us
had better be, too.

46:16.482 --> 46:19.860
I will not follow
that man into combat.

46:23.363 --> 46:24.406
Me neither.

46:27.576 --> 46:28.744
Alright.

46:30.204 --> 46:31.538
Then let's do it.

46:45.427 --> 46:46.845
Guarnere:
"I hereby...

46:48.555 --> 46:49.932
"no longer...

46:51.850 --> 46:53.227
"wish to serve...

46:56.146 --> 46:57.981
"as a non-commissioned
officer...

47:05.113 --> 47:06.448
"in Easy Company."

47:20.337 --> 47:21.672
Alright, boys.

47:23.006 --> 47:24.258
Good luck.

47:28.762 --> 47:31.431
I ought to have you
all shot!

47:31.515 --> 47:33.016
This is nothing less than
an act of mutiny

47:33.100 --> 47:35.686
while we prepare for
the goddamn invasion
of Europe.

47:36.853 --> 47:38.188
Sergeant Harris.

47:38.272 --> 47:40.399
Sir.

47:38.272 --> 47:40.399
Turn in your stripes,
collect your gear.

47:40.482 --> 47:43.360
You are hereby transferred
out of my regiment.

47:44.319 --> 47:45.362
Sir.

47:44.319 --> 47:45.362
Get out.

47:47.489 --> 47:49.575
Sergeant Ranney.

47:47.489 --> 47:49.575
Sir.

47:49.658 --> 47:53.328
You consider yourself lucky,
I'm only busting you
to private.

47:53.412 --> 47:56.665
All of you NCOs
have disgraced
the 101st Airborne.

47:56.748 --> 47:59.459
You can
consider yourself lucky
that we are on the eve

47:59.543 --> 48:02.004
of the largest action
in the history of warfare,

48:02.087 --> 48:06.425
which leaves me no choice,
but to spare your lives.

48:09.595 --> 48:11.763
Now, get out of my office
and get out of my sight.

48:12.973 --> 48:14.016
Get.

48:30.866 --> 48:32.326
Keep 'em coming,
that-a-boy.

48:32.409 --> 48:33.869
That's it.

49:06.401 --> 49:07.611
Sobel:
I can only
speculate, sir.

49:07.694 --> 49:09.696
Most of the men would--
would never do this,

49:09.780 --> 49:13.283
but... I believe just
a few of the sergeants

49:13.367 --> 49:16.119
may have felt their loyalty
lay more to the platoon

49:16.203 --> 49:18.789
than to the company.

49:18.872 --> 49:22.376
And these few sergeants
convinced all of the other
NCOs in your company

49:22.459 --> 49:23.794
to turn in
their stripes?

49:23.877 --> 49:26.004
As staff sergeants,
they have a great amount
of influence, sir.

49:26.088 --> 49:27.714
But as I say,
the rest are good men.

49:27.798 --> 49:29.591
I know them,
I can work with them.

49:37.391 --> 49:39.559
This business with
the Winters court-martial

49:39.643 --> 49:41.895
has been
an unpleasant distraction.

49:41.978 --> 49:43.939
Indeed--
indeed it has, sir.

49:44.898 --> 49:46.149
However...

49:46.233 --> 49:49.528
your command of Easy Company
has been exemplary.

49:49.611 --> 49:51.029
Thank-- thank you, sir.

49:52.364 --> 49:53.949
In fact...

49:54.032 --> 49:57.119
except for the actions
of a few of your noncoms,

49:57.202 --> 49:59.204
I believe you've fielded one
of the finest companies

49:59.287 --> 50:00.872

50:01.957 --> 50:03.041
Yes, sir.

such as doctors and chaplains,
to take jump training there.

50:20.934 --> 50:23.437

56:02.275 --> 56:04.736
is to take the town
of Careltan, or Carentan,

56:04.819 --> 56:09.074
thus linking Utah
and Omaha into a single
continuous beachhead.

56:09.157 --> 56:12.744
Meehan:
...linking Omah and Utah
into one continuous beachhead.

56:12.827 --> 56:15.747
Each trooper will
learn this operation by heart

56:15.830 --> 56:18.249
and know his and every other
outfits' mission

56:18.333 --> 56:20.293
to the detail.

56:18.333 --> 56:20.293
Lieutenant Meehan?

56:20.376 --> 56:22.670
Yes, Dukeman.

56:20.376 --> 56:22.670
Sir, are we
dropping tonight?

56:22.754 --> 56:24.798
When it's time
for you to know,
we'll let you know.

56:24.881 --> 56:28.009
In the meantime,
study these sand tables, maps,

56:28.093 --> 56:29.594
and reconnaissance photos

56:29.677 --> 56:32.639
until you can draw a map
of the area by memory.

56:32.722 --> 56:35.308
Now, we will drop
behind this Atlantic Wall

56:35.391 --> 56:39.020
five hours before
the 4th Infantry
lands at Utah.

56:39.104 --> 56:42.899
And between our assembly area
and the battalion's objective,

56:42.982 --> 56:44.400
there is
a German garrison

56:44.484 --> 56:47.278
right here in this area,
St. Marie du Mont.

56:47.362 --> 56:50.365
Easy Company will
destroy that garrison.

56:53.201 --> 56:56.830
Three day supply of K-rations,
chocolate bars, charms candy,

56:56.913 --> 56:58.623
powdered coffee,
sugar, and matches.

56:58.706 --> 57:01.126
compass, bayonet,
entrenching tool,

57:01.209 --> 57:02.836
ammunition, gas mask.

57:02.919 --> 57:07.382
Musette bag with ammo,
my webbing, my .45, canteen,

57:07.465 --> 57:08.842
two cartons of smokes,

57:08.925 --> 57:10.635
Hawkins mine,
two grenades,

57:10.718 --> 57:12.137
smoke grenade,
gamma grenade,

57:12.220 --> 57:13.513
TNT,
this bullshit,

57:13.596 --> 57:15.515
and a pair
of nasty skivvies.

57:15.598 --> 57:16.641
What's your point?

57:16.724 --> 57:18.184
You know, this stuff
weighs as much as I do.

57:18.268 --> 57:19.727
I've still got my chute,
my reserve chute,

57:19.811 --> 57:21.187
my Mae West, my M1.

57:21.271 --> 57:22.939
Where are you keeping
your brass knuckles?

57:23.982 --> 57:25.942
I could use some
brass knuckles.

57:26.025 --> 57:27.152
Vest:
Sergeant Martin!

57:27.235 --> 57:28.486
Hey, Vest,
anything for me?

57:28.570 --> 57:30.738
No. Sergeant Martin.

57:30.822 --> 57:32.115
Martin: J.W.!

57:34.993 --> 57:36.327
Talbert!

57:38.163 --> 57:39.747
Talbert!

57:39.831 --> 57:42.292
Floyd.
Floyd M. Here.

57:43.293 --> 57:45.295
Heavy.
Your condoms?

57:45.378 --> 57:46.838
I don't know,
probably.

57:46.921 --> 57:47.797
What you got?

57:47.881 --> 57:50.675
"Dear Floyd,
give 'em hell."

57:50.758 --> 57:52.719
It's from Chief of
the Kokomo Police Department.

57:52.802 --> 57:53.845
Right.

57:55.680 --> 57:56.764
Whoa.

57:57.682 --> 57:59.225
You've gotta
love cops.

57:59.309 --> 58:02.604
Lipton:
Alright, listen up, listen up.

58:02.687 --> 58:06.733
If you did not sign your
GI life insurance policy,

58:06.816 --> 58:09.194
you go on over
and see Sergeant Evans

58:09.277 --> 58:11.487
at the Headquarters
Company tent.

58:12.447 --> 58:13.740
You boys don't
let your families

58:13.823 --> 58:15.783
miss out on $10,000.

58:17.118 --> 58:18.203
You hear that, Gerry?

58:18.286 --> 58:19.871
Hey, Lip?

58:18.286 --> 58:19.871
Yeah, boy.

58:22.999 --> 58:25.126
Has Guarnere said anything
to you about his brother?

58:25.210 --> 58:28.087
No.

58:25.210 --> 58:28.087
I got a problem.

58:28.171 --> 58:29.756
My wife keeps up
with things back home,

58:29.839 --> 58:31.382
casualty lists
and like that.

58:31.466 --> 58:32.508
Yeah?

58:32.592 --> 58:34.135
Guarnere's brother
in Italy?

58:34.219 --> 58:35.220
Henry?

58:36.137 --> 58:37.513
Killed in
Monte Cassino.

58:39.224 --> 58:40.934
Well, I'm sure
he doesn't know.

58:41.017 --> 58:43.394
Damn. What'd you think
I should do?

58:45.063 --> 58:46.898
If it were me,
I'd tell him.

58:47.857 --> 58:49.525
Couple of hours
before we jump?

58:51.236 --> 58:52.570
I don't know.

59:01.829 --> 59:04.999
Why they springing
these things on us now?

59:05.083 --> 59:08.461
It's just an extra 80 pounds
strapped to your leg.

59:08.544 --> 59:11.673
Does anybody have any idea
how the hell this thing works?

59:12.840 --> 59:13.967
Vest:
Colonel Sink.

59:17.053 --> 59:18.137
Colonel Sink.

59:20.556 --> 59:22.016
(mimics Sink)
"Soldiers of the regiment:

59:22.976 --> 59:25.270
"Tonight is the night...

59:26.229 --> 59:27.397
(normal voice)
"of nights.

59:28.815 --> 59:31.776
"Today, as you read this,
you are en route

59:31.859 --> 59:34.779
"to the great adventure
for which you have trained

59:34.862 --> 59:36.072
"for over two years."

59:37.156 --> 59:39.158
So, that's why
they gave us ice cream.

59:42.036 --> 59:44.622
Meehan:
Easy Company,
listen up!

59:47.041 --> 59:50.044
Channel coast is socked in
with rain and fog.

59:50.128 --> 59:52.505
No jump tonight.

59:52.588 --> 59:54.799
The invasion
has been postponed.

59:54.882 --> 59:57.635
We're on a 24-hour
stand-down.

59:59.929 --> 1:00:03.516
Well... this is
quite a surprise.

1:00:03.599 --> 1:00:04.809
Not particularly.

1:00:04.892 --> 1:00:07.478
It so happens
I rather expected it.

1:00:07.562 --> 1:00:10.315
Man on film:
Well, I can't see
how you people

1:00:10.398 --> 1:00:13.401
can pass up $80,000
for the cause.

1:00:13.484 --> 1:00:15.111
Woman:
For whose cause?

1:00:15.194 --> 1:00:17.488
If you're so interested
in serving a cause,

1:00:17.572 --> 1:00:18.698

Woman 2:
You look "1A" to me.

1:00:26.831 --> 1:00:28.374
Hey, you don't
look so bad yourself.

1:00:28.458 --> 1:00:29.625
(chuckles)

1:00:30.710 --> 1:00:31.961
"Dearest Johnny."

Woman on film:
Well, should you
be giving blood?

1:00:34.964 --> 1:00:36.007
Man:
I woke up.

1:00:37.216 --> 1:00:38.176
Woman:
Something happened--

1:00:38.259 --> 1:00:39.802
I got the wrong
goddamn jacket.

1:00:41.054 --> 1:00:42.930
Shh.

1:00:41.054 --> 1:00:42.930
