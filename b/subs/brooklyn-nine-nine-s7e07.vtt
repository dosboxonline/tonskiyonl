WEBVTT

00:04.045 --> 00:05.756
What's this meeting about?

00:05.798 --> 00:07.842
Did someone find

00:05.798 --> 00:07.842
my meatball sub?

00:07.883 --> 00:09.134
A, we would never have

00:07.883 --> 00:09.134
a meeting about that.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.552
-B, you are holding it.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.552
-Oh.

00:10.594 --> 00:12.053
[chuckles]

00:10.594 --> 00:12.053
Meeting adjourned.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.555
Meeting is not over, dummy.

00:13.597 --> 00:14.682
Terry said he has some

00:13.597 --> 00:14.682
news from the office

00:14.723 --> 00:16.099
of Commissioner Wuntch.

00:16.141 --> 00:17.685
Ugh, what does that

00:16.141 --> 00:17.685
human blister want now?

00:17.726 --> 00:19.937
Does she intend

00:17.726 --> 00:19.937
to demote me even further?

00:19.979 --> 00:22.314
Or perhaps she'll transfer me

00:19.979 --> 00:22.314
to the swamps of New Jersey

00:22.356 --> 00:24.942
so I can patrol the sinkhole

00:22.356 --> 00:24.942
where she was spawned.

00:24.984 --> 00:26.610
Or it's possible the

00:24.984 --> 00:26.610
announcement has nothing

00:26.652 --> 00:28.153
-to do with you.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.153
-Oh, good thinking, Peralta.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.947
You're right.

00:29.989 --> 00:31.532
Maybe Madeline wants

00:29.989 --> 00:31.532
to inform us all

00:29.989 --> 00:31.532
that she's a Cheuksin.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.033
-A what?

00:31.573 --> 00:33.033
-A Cheuksin.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.076
A Korean toilet ghost.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.076
Lives in an outhouse?

00:35.118 --> 00:37.454
Wraps her hair around you

00:35.118 --> 00:37.454
throat and chokes you to death

00:37.496 --> 00:39.164
-while you move your bowels?

00:37.496 --> 00:39.164
-You know what?

00:39.206 --> 00:41.082
I will give you $6,000

00:41.124 --> 00:43.126
if the announcement

00:41.124 --> 00:43.126
is she's a Cheuksin.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.587
OK, everyone.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.587
I have some news.

00:45.629 --> 00:47.882
That Madeline Wuntch

00:45.629 --> 00:47.882
is a Korean toilet ghost?

00:47.923 --> 00:49.925
Boring.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.925
We already knew that.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.886
Madeline Wuntch is dead.

00:51.927 --> 00:53.012
Say what now?

00:53.052 --> 00:56.932
[theme song playing]

01:12.990 --> 01:15.325
-Wait, Wuntch is dead?

01:12.990 --> 01:15.325
-[Terry] Yeah.

01:15.367 --> 01:17.285
The Commissioner's office

01:15.367 --> 01:17.285
just notified us.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.871
[Holt]

01:17.327 --> 01:18.871
No way that's true.

01:18.913 --> 01:20.455
As Wuntch says

01:18.913 --> 01:20.455
when she sees deodorant,

01:20.497 --> 01:22.332
-"I'm not buying it."

01:20.497 --> 01:22.332
-[Rosa laughs]

01:22.374 --> 01:24.083
-Sir, she's dead.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.083
-Oh, Terry.

01:24.125 --> 01:27.254
Zombies can't die.

01:24.125 --> 01:27.254
This is some sort of scam.

01:27.295 --> 01:28.589
If she were dead,

01:28.630 --> 01:30.424
we would be hearing

01:28.630 --> 01:30.424
the sounds of children

01:30.465 --> 01:31.926
-singing in the streets.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.926
-[Charles] I don't know, sir.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.343
You didn't believe it

01:31.967 --> 01:33.343
when we told you

01:33.385 --> 01:34.845
the Disco Strangler

01:33.385 --> 01:34.845
died, either.

01:34.887 --> 01:35.763
And I was right.

01:34.887 --> 01:35.763
He was faking it.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.138
Maybe she's alive.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.766
Why would Wuntch fake

01:37.180 --> 01:38.766
her own death?

01:38.807 --> 01:40.308
The same reason she visits

01:38.807 --> 01:40.308
Mexico once a year

01:40.350 --> 01:41.977
and sucks the blood

01:40.350 --> 01:41.977
from all the goats.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.353
For kicks.

01:43.395 --> 01:44.855
Look, I don't know

01:43.395 --> 01:44.855
what to tell you,

01:44.897 --> 01:46.314
but she's dead.

01:44.897 --> 01:46.314
What do you want?

01:46.356 --> 01:47.816
To open up her coffin

01:46.356 --> 01:47.816
and check for yourself?

01:48.734 --> 01:50.652
Oh, she's very dead.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.237
[Jake]

01:50.694 --> 01:52.237
Hello, gentlemen.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.197
Guess who's walking

01:52.279 --> 01:54.197
the red carpet this Saturday?

01:54.239 --> 01:56.283
-Chord Overstreet.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.283
-Who?

01:56.324 --> 01:58.159
-Sam Evans from "Glee."

01:56.324 --> 01:58.159
-No, me.

01:58.201 --> 02:00.161
Why would you guess that?

01:58.201 --> 02:00.161
I was clearly talking about me.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.663
OK, but for the record,

02:01.705 --> 02:03.040
I bet Chord Overstreet

02:01.705 --> 02:03.040
will also be walking one.

02:03.082 --> 02:04.499
Stop talking about

02:03.082 --> 02:04.499
Chord Overstreet.

02:04.541 --> 02:05.751
No, I'm going

02:04.541 --> 02:05.751
to the world premiere

02:05.793 --> 02:07.878
of "Kwazy Kupcakes: The Movie."

02:07.920 --> 02:09.671
Whoa! How'd you

02:07.920 --> 02:09.671
get the invite?

02:09.713 --> 02:11.339
My buddy Mikey J.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.339
hooked me up.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.758
Oh, your ska friend?

02:11.381 --> 02:12.758
Did he work on the movie?

02:12.800 --> 02:14.426
No, he submitted

02:12.800 --> 02:14.426
an unsolicited script

02:14.468 --> 02:16.177
that a producer

02:14.468 --> 02:16.177
accidentally opened,

02:16.219 --> 02:18.221
so legally they had to give

02:16.219 --> 02:18.221
him a "story by" credit,

02:18.263 --> 02:19.807
and now I've got four tickets.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.892
Wow.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.892
So who you bringing?

02:21.934 --> 02:24.853
You know, Cagney and Lacey

02:21.934 --> 02:24.853
love "Kwazy Kupcakes."

02:24.895 --> 02:27.355
-They are crazy Kwazy fans.

02:24.895 --> 02:27.355
-Huh, cool.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.857
Well, if you guys

02:27.397 --> 02:28.857
are free this Saturday--

02:28.899 --> 02:30.609
Stop, before you say

02:28.899 --> 02:30.609
anything you regret,

02:30.651 --> 02:32.569
you should know that

02:30.651 --> 02:32.569
"Kwazy Kupcakes"

02:32.611 --> 02:34.113
means a lot to Nikolaj.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.615
At the orphanage, that game

02:34.154 --> 02:36.615
was his only friend.

02:36.657 --> 02:37.992
Touching, but

02:36.657 --> 02:37.992
Cagney and Lacey

02:38.033 --> 02:39.534
don't have any

02:38.033 --> 02:39.534
friends at all.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.078
Maybe they can make

02:39.576 --> 02:41.078
some at this event.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.454
[Charles]

02:41.120 --> 02:42.454
So what do you say, Jake?

02:42.496 --> 02:44.081
-Whose kids do you like more?

02:42.496 --> 02:44.081
-What?

02:44.123 --> 02:45.666
Wait, wait, wait.

02:44.123 --> 02:45.666
That's not what this is about.

02:45.707 --> 02:46.875
No, Boyle's right.

02:45.707 --> 02:46.875
Whose kids do you like more?

02:46.917 --> 02:48.293
-Tell us now!

02:46.917 --> 02:48.293
-OK.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.711
You guys are being

02:48.335 --> 02:49.711
really intense.

02:49.753 --> 02:51.254
I like all of your kids

02:49.753 --> 02:51.254
an equal amount.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.840
Just give me some space

02:51.296 --> 02:52.840
and I'll figure out

02:52.881 --> 02:54.591
-who I'm gonna take.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.591
-OK, backing off.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.010
-Stepping away.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.010
-Making room.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.594
-Letting you breathe.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.594
-Thank you.

02:57.636 --> 03:00.889
[cell phone chimes]

03:00.931 --> 03:03.600
Did you both just send me

03:00.931 --> 03:03.600
pictures of your kids crying?

03:03.642 --> 03:04.977
[both]

03:03.642 --> 03:04.977
No.

03:05.019 --> 03:07.938
Ding, dong,

03:05.019 --> 03:07.938
the Wuntch is dead!

03:07.980 --> 03:09.982
Bagels for everyone!

03:10.024 --> 03:11.483
So I guess you

03:10.024 --> 03:11.483
believe it now.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.276
Yep. Wanna see

03:11.525 --> 03:13.276
the selfies I took?

03:13.318 --> 03:14.862
-Actually, yes.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.862
-I'll share the album

03:13.318 --> 03:14.862
with you.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.031
Oh, my God!

03:14.903 --> 03:17.031
I just heard about Wuntch!

03:17.072 --> 03:18.532
She was so young!

03:18.573 --> 03:19.825
For a redwood tree.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.493
Uh, I don't understand

03:19.867 --> 03:21.493
what's going on.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.495
-Why are you crying?

03:21.535 --> 03:23.495
-A person is dead.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.580
-I feel sad.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.580
-That's insane.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.708
You don't feel sad

03:25.622 --> 03:27.708
when a monster dies

03:27.749 --> 03:28.750
in a monster movie.

03:28.792 --> 03:29.918
In "E.T.,"

03:29.960 --> 03:31.545
do you feel sad

03:29.960 --> 03:31.545
when E.T. dies?

03:31.586 --> 03:33.296
-Yes.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.296
-He wasn't a monster.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.340
-He caused a real commotion.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.340
-It isn't just Wuntch.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.258
I started seeing

03:35.382 --> 03:37.258
a fertility doctor

03:37.300 --> 03:39.887
and she has me taking hormones

03:37.300 --> 03:39.887
to help with ovulation

03:39.928 --> 03:42.305
and my emotions

03:39.928 --> 03:42.305
are in overdrive.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.766
Well, I know just the thing

03:42.347 --> 03:44.766
to cheer you up.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.519
Wuntch is dead! Bagel!

03:47.561 --> 03:49.521
Bagel! Bagel!

03:49.563 --> 03:51.356
Sir, I am loving

03:49.563 --> 03:51.356
this color on you,

03:51.398 --> 03:52.900
but don't you think

03:51.398 --> 03:52.900
you should tone it down?

03:52.941 --> 03:54.693
Why, in case I run

03:52.941 --> 03:54.693
into her family?

03:54.735 --> 03:56.403
I'm not planning any trips

03:54.735 --> 03:56.403
to the Bronx Zoo.

03:56.444 --> 03:57.863
Wait.

03:57.905 --> 03:58.947
Does this mean you're

03:57.905 --> 03:58.947
gonna be captain again?

03:58.989 --> 04:00.074
It does.

04:00.115 --> 04:01.449
The Chief of Personnel called

04:01.491 --> 04:02.701
to say the promotion

04:01.491 --> 04:02.701
is in the works.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.369
Her death means I've won.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.329
It's finally over.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.582
[cell phone chimes]

04:08.623 --> 04:11.752
An email... from

04:08.623 --> 04:11.752
Madeline Wuntch?

04:11.793 --> 04:14.922
Subject line: "It's not over."

04:14.963 --> 04:16.464
My friends,

04:16.506 --> 04:19.218
I have a proclamation

04:16.506 --> 04:19.218
to bestow upon ye.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.510
Why are you talking

04:19.259 --> 04:20.510
like that?

04:20.552 --> 04:21.678
And why'd you have us

04:20.552 --> 04:21.678
come in here?

04:21.720 --> 04:22.930
Is this about the tickets?

04:22.971 --> 04:24.765
It is indeed about

04:22.971 --> 04:24.765
said tickets,

04:24.806 --> 04:27.101
and said proclamation about

04:24.806 --> 04:27.101
said tickets is in fact--

04:27.142 --> 04:29.477
Jake, just tell us.

04:27.142 --> 04:29.477
No one is liking this.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.021
I'm loving it.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.021
You sound so smart.

04:31.063 --> 04:33.774
Oh, thank you,

04:31.063 --> 04:33.774
my loyal subject Charles.

04:33.815 --> 04:37.736
Now, as you know, this decision

04:33.815 --> 04:37.736
has been quite hard upon me--

04:37.778 --> 04:41.531
title of mine sex tape--but

04:37.778 --> 04:41.531
I have made it at long last,

04:41.573 --> 04:45.535
and it is my decree

04:41.573 --> 04:45.535
that the recipient shall be...

04:46.327 --> 04:47.871
-Both of you.

04:46.327 --> 04:47.871
-What?

04:47.913 --> 04:49.164
Did you talk to Mikey J.

04:47.913 --> 04:49.164
and get more tickets?

04:49.206 --> 04:50.207
Indeed I did not,

04:50.249 --> 04:51.250
but it is my decision

04:51.291 --> 04:52.584
that I will cut all

04:52.626 --> 04:54.795
-of said tickets in twain.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.795
-Twain?

04:54.836 --> 04:57.338
Terry doesn't want a twained

04:54.836 --> 04:57.338
ticket to "Kwazy Kupcakes."

04:57.380 --> 04:59.049
That's not how tickets work.

04:59.091 --> 05:00.092
-You'd just be ruining them.

04:59.091 --> 05:00.092
-None of us would get in.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.676
-Are you dumb?

05:00.134 --> 05:01.676
-No!

05:01.718 --> 05:03.053
All right,

05:01.718 --> 05:03.053
full disclosure.

05:03.095 --> 05:04.763
I was trying to do

05:03.095 --> 05:04.763
that Bible thing,

05:04.805 --> 05:06.514
and then one of you was

05:04.805 --> 05:06.514
gonna take the high road

05:06.556 --> 05:07.557
and say that rather than

05:06.556 --> 05:07.557
see the tickets destroyed,

05:07.599 --> 05:08.516
you would just bow out,

05:08.558 --> 05:09.601
and then that person

05:09.643 --> 05:10.435
was gonna get the tickets.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.812
[Terry]

05:10.477 --> 05:11.812
Nope.

05:11.853 --> 05:12.896
If I don't get them,

05:11.853 --> 05:12.896
no one does.

05:12.938 --> 05:14.397
Agreed.

05:12.938 --> 05:14.397
Boyles or bust.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.399
-Cut 'em up.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.399
-Ohh. I'm not gonna do that.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.193
I'm just gonna have

05:16.441 --> 05:18.193
to think of another way

05:16.441 --> 05:18.193
to figure this out.

05:18.235 --> 05:21.155
Stupid Bible and it's stupid

05:18.235 --> 05:21.155
lessons never solved crap!

05:21.196 --> 05:23.573
So you were right.

05:21.196 --> 05:23.573
Wuntch was not able

05:21.196 --> 05:23.573
to claw through her coffin

05:23.615 --> 05:25.242
and write

05:23.615 --> 05:25.242
the email herself.

05:25.284 --> 05:27.286
It turns out, the lawyer

05:25.284 --> 05:27.286
for her estate sent it.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.121
I wish I had taken

05:27.327 --> 05:29.121
the LSATs.

05:29.163 --> 05:32.291
Not to be a lawyer,

05:29.163 --> 05:32.291
just seems like a fun test.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.792
-Dude, you're bumming us out.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.792
-All right.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.335
Uh, the email contains

05:33.834 --> 05:36.335
a link to a video.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.088
I'm going to play it.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.088
Brace yourselves.

05:38.130 --> 05:39.589
If it shows Madeline,

05:39.631 --> 05:41.049
be sure not to look directly

05:39.631 --> 05:41.049
into her eyes.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.509
-Because we'll turn to stone?

05:41.091 --> 05:42.509
-No.

05:42.550 --> 05:43.969
Because her eyes are ugly.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.554
Hello, Raymond.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.554
Surprised to see me?

05:46.596 --> 05:48.682
Well, I didn't say

05:46.596 --> 05:48.682
Bloody Mary three times,

05:48.723 --> 05:50.809
-so yes.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.809
-When did she record this?

05:50.851 --> 05:52.311
Judging by the flames

05:50.851 --> 05:52.311
around her,

05:52.351 --> 05:53.603
-it could be a live stream.

05:52.351 --> 05:53.603
-[laughs]

05:53.645 --> 05:55.272
Very good, Rosa.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.272
[laughs]

05:55.314 --> 05:57.732
I'm sure you consider

05:55.314 --> 05:57.732
my untimely death a victory,

05:57.774 --> 05:59.276
but I'd never let you win.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.528
I told everyone that

05:59.318 --> 06:01.528
in my final days,

06:01.569 --> 06:05.240
we reconciled and you insisted

06:01.569 --> 06:05.240
on hosting and organizing

06:05.282 --> 06:07.075
my NYPD memorial service.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.786
I know you won't be able

06:07.117 --> 06:09.786
to resist badmouthing me

06:09.828 --> 06:11.246
at the service.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.622
All the top brass

06:11.288 --> 06:12.622
will be there,

06:12.664 --> 06:13.707
and when you speak ill of me,

06:13.748 --> 06:14.708
it will end your career.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.877
It's over. I won.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.253
Bye, Raymond.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.672
Oh, no.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.672
I'm doomed.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.133
Seriously? All you have to do

06:20.714 --> 06:23.133
is not insult a dead woman

06:23.175 --> 06:26.136
-at her own memorial service.

06:23.175 --> 06:26.136
-Exactly.

06:26.178 --> 06:27.846
It's impossible.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.309
Oh, you must

06:30.598 --> 06:32.309
be feeling better.

06:32.351 --> 06:33.894
You're heating up

06:32.351 --> 06:33.894
your favorite meal: beans.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.603
[Holt] They're refried.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.522
It's bad enough

06:35.645 --> 06:37.522
they were cooked once,

06:35.645 --> 06:37.522
let alone twice,

06:37.564 --> 06:38.940
and now the toaster oven

06:37.564 --> 06:38.940
makes it three times.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.901
I couldn't be crying

06:38.982 --> 06:40.901
for help any louder.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.569
So I take it you

06:40.942 --> 06:42.569
couldn't get out

06:42.610 --> 06:44.196
of organizing

06:42.610 --> 06:44.196
Wuntch's memorial.

06:44.238 --> 06:45.530
Oh, no.

06:44.238 --> 06:45.530
It's impossible.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.157
She has bested

06:45.572 --> 06:47.157
me yet again.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.659
Well then stop being such

06:47.199 --> 06:49.659
a moron, you idiot!

06:49.701 --> 06:51.953
-Amy!

06:49.701 --> 06:51.953
-Sorry, it's the hormones.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.330
They're making me

06:51.995 --> 06:53.330
really irritable.

06:53.372 --> 06:54.915
Angry Amy's right.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.333
All you have to do is say

06:54.956 --> 06:56.333
a few nice comments

06:56.375 --> 06:58.085
-during the memorial.

06:56.375 --> 06:58.085
-As God said

06:58.126 --> 06:59.627
when Wuntch tried to sneak

06:58.126 --> 06:59.627
past the gates into heaven,

06:59.669 --> 07:01.755
-"It ain't happening, honey."

06:59.669 --> 07:01.755
-[Rosa laughs]

07:01.796 --> 07:04.716
I tried to write

07:01.796 --> 07:04.716
a kind speech

07:01.796 --> 07:04.716
about her last night,

07:04.758 --> 07:06.927
-and this is what came out.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.927
-Oh.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.595
It's, like, 20 pages long.

07:08.636 --> 07:11.681
-Why is it in all caps?

07:08.636 --> 07:11.681
-So I remember to yell it.

07:11.723 --> 07:14.142
Oh, well, you obviously

07:11.723 --> 07:14.142
can't read any of this.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.770
Look, since you can't

07:14.184 --> 07:16.770
say anything nice,

07:16.811 --> 07:19.398
try saying the opposite

07:16.811 --> 07:19.398
of whatever you're thinking.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.815
Interesting.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.109
I'll give it a whirl.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.738
Madeline Wuntch was...

07:27.655 --> 07:29.157
-A friend.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.157
-See?

07:29.199 --> 07:30.658
It's not that hard

07:29.199 --> 07:30.658
to say something ni--

07:30.700 --> 07:32.035
-Oh, you're vomiting.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.035
-[Holt gagging]

07:32.077 --> 07:34.413
Hi, Jake.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.413
It's me, Nikolaj.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.789
Hey, bud.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.789
What are you doing here?

07:35.830 --> 07:37.165
It's Thursday.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.333
Shouldn't you be

07:37.207 --> 07:38.333
at tailoring class?

07:38.375 --> 07:39.751
I want to say thank you.

07:39.793 --> 07:40.961
Dad said that you were

07:39.793 --> 07:40.961
giving us tickets

07:41.002 --> 07:42.462
to the "Kwazy Kupcakes" movie.

07:42.503 --> 07:45.966
Oh, he did, did he?

07:42.503 --> 07:45.966
Excuse me one second.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.802
-Of all the twisted moves!

07:46.007 --> 07:48.802
-Don't hate the player.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.345
Go ahead.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.345
Tell Niko he's not going.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.471
-I dare you.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.471
-[Jake snarls]

07:51.512 --> 07:52.722
[laughs]

07:51.512 --> 07:52.722
Hey, listen.

07:52.764 --> 07:54.099
[clears throat]

07:54.141 --> 07:55.642
Niko, there's something

07:54.141 --> 07:55.642
I gotta tell you.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.144
[Cagney and Lacey]

07:55.683 --> 07:57.144
Uncle Jake! Uncle Jake!

07:57.185 --> 07:59.687
Slow down, girls.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.687
No need to run.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.648
Uncle Jake is family.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.067
Now, what do you wanna

08:01.689 --> 08:04.067
say to Uncle Jake?

08:04.109 --> 08:06.445
[both]

08:04.109 --> 08:06.445
Thank you for the tickets.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.196
[Terry] Oh, that's so cute

08:06.486 --> 08:08.196
how you said that

08:08.238 --> 08:10.490
at the same time without

08:08.238 --> 08:10.490
rehearsing it in the car.

08:10.531 --> 08:12.409
It sure is.

08:10.531 --> 08:12.409
Hey, Terry, Charles,

08:12.451 --> 08:14.035
can I speak with you in the

08:12.451 --> 08:14.035
break room for a moment?

08:14.077 --> 08:16.746
Uh, hey, kids,

08:14.077 --> 08:16.746
look at this.

08:16.788 --> 08:17.914
Pimping out your kids?

08:17.956 --> 08:19.374
I hate to say this,

08:17.956 --> 08:19.374
but you two

08:19.416 --> 08:21.251
are acting like bad dads,

08:19.416 --> 08:21.251
and I should know.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.919
One time my father forgot

08:21.293 --> 08:22.919
to pick me up from school

08:22.961 --> 08:24.796
'cause he was having sex

08:22.961 --> 08:24.796
with my best friend's mom.

08:24.838 --> 08:25.839
Oh, my God.

08:24.838 --> 08:25.839
That's terrible.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.007
Yeah.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.007
I was 15.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.467
I just walked to the mall

08:28.508 --> 08:30.051
and watched "Empire Records"

08:28.508 --> 08:30.051
by myself,

08:30.093 --> 08:31.552
but the point is,

08:30.093 --> 08:31.552
you're both acting ridiculous.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.263
No, this is on

08:31.594 --> 08:33.263
you, Jake.

08:33.305 --> 08:35.390
-You need to make a choice.

08:33.305 --> 08:35.390
-That's not fair.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.809
You both want to go and I don't

08:35.432 --> 08:37.809
want to hurt either of you.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.978
But maybe I don't have to.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.730
I can let fate hurt you.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.730
We'll flip a coin.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.192
Terry, call it in the air.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.192
Heads or tails.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.693
[grunts]

08:45.233 --> 08:46.693
Neither.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.528
[Jake]

08:46.734 --> 08:48.528
Oh, my God.

08:48.569 --> 08:50.030
Did you just fold

08:48.569 --> 08:50.030
my quarter in half?

08:50.071 --> 08:51.572
Fate's a bitch.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.408
You make the choice.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.952
Wow, wow, wow,

08:53.450 --> 08:55.952
wow, wow, wow.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.579
Just so you know, I would

08:55.994 --> 08:58.579
never bend your money.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.123
-Yeah, 'cause you can't.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.123
-Correct, I cannot.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.125
No one can.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.125
How did he do that?

09:02.167 --> 09:04.961
Now these fertility drugs

09:02.167 --> 09:04.961
are making me sweat.

09:05.003 --> 09:06.213
-Is it noticeable?

09:05.003 --> 09:06.213
-No.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.714
-Yes.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.714
-[Holt] Oh.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.049
I thought we were

09:07.755 --> 09:09.049
gonna lie to her

09:09.090 --> 09:10.591
because it's so

09:09.090 --> 09:10.591
upsetting to look at.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.093
Just tell me what room

09:10.633 --> 09:12.093
the memorial is in.

09:12.135 --> 09:13.303
We don't have a lot

09:12.135 --> 09:13.303
of time to set up.

09:13.345 --> 09:14.637
[Holt]

09:13.345 --> 09:14.637
About that.

09:14.679 --> 09:15.805
Yesterday before

09:14.679 --> 09:15.805
you convinced me

09:15.847 --> 09:17.598
to hold a respectful

09:15.847 --> 09:17.598
service,

09:17.640 --> 09:20.852
I sent some instructions for

09:17.640 --> 09:20.852
how I wanted the room to look.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.563
We... may need to make

09:20.894 --> 09:23.563
some tweaks.

09:23.604 --> 09:26.983
[shocking music]

09:27.025 --> 09:29.652
-So many balloon arches.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.652
-I know.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.946
It all has to go.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.946
OK!

09:31.988 --> 09:33.990
Everyone, we have

09:31.988 --> 09:33.990
work to do.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.825
[organ music]

09:35.867 --> 09:37.327
-Better?

09:35.867 --> 09:37.327
-Much.

09:37.369 --> 09:39.162
But to be clear,

09:37.369 --> 09:39.162
the first version was dope

09:39.204 --> 09:40.247
and you have my

09:39.204 --> 09:40.247
respect for life.

09:40.288 --> 09:41.915
[man]

09:40.288 --> 09:41.915
Excuse me.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.125
Is this the memorial

09:41.956 --> 09:44.125
for Madeline Wuntch?

09:44.167 --> 09:47.754
Yes, this is the memorial

09:44.167 --> 09:47.754
for Madeline Wuntch.

09:47.795 --> 09:51.425
Just saying her name

09:47.795 --> 09:51.425
brings tears to my eyes.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.801
Why, because her heart

09:51.466 --> 09:53.801
was made of onions?

09:53.843 --> 09:55.053
Excuse me?

09:55.095 --> 09:56.555
Madeline Wuntch

09:55.095 --> 09:56.555
was what you get

09:56.596 --> 09:58.306
when you cross a slug

09:56.596 --> 09:58.306
with an anal fissure.

09:58.348 --> 10:01.809
We spent our entire lives

09:58.348 --> 10:01.809
trying to destroy each other.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.479
I was her one true nemesis.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.943
No.

10:09.984 --> 10:10.985
[Terry]

10:09.984 --> 10:10.985
Hey there, Jake.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.612
I felt bad about folding

10:12.653 --> 10:13.613
your quarter in half,

10:13.654 --> 10:15.949
so I got you a new one.

10:15.990 --> 10:19.119
Thank you.

10:15.990 --> 10:19.119
But that's not a quarter.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.328
Wow, you're right.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.038
That happens to be an 1883

10:22.080 --> 10:23.998
Carson City silver dollar

10:22.080 --> 10:23.998
in near-mint condition

10:24.040 --> 10:25.500
complete with

10:24.040 --> 10:25.500
commemorative case.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.751
[whistles]

10:26.793 --> 10:29.296
That's gotta be worth $138.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.422
You know what?

10:29.337 --> 10:30.422
Keep it.

10:30.464 --> 10:31.714
Shame.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.174
Shame, Terrence Jeffords,

10:31.756 --> 10:33.174
shame!

10:33.216 --> 10:34.884
You probably didn't

10:33.216 --> 10:34.884
realize this, Jake,

10:34.926 --> 10:36.761
but the lieutenant over here

10:34.926 --> 10:36.761
is trying to bribe you.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.096
Yeah, I don't think

10:36.803 --> 10:38.096
he's hiding that.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.764
-I am not.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.764
-Well, neither am I.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.766
Here's a check for $200.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.018
Another silver dollar.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.728
Ooh, looks like I'm up to 276.

10:45.770 --> 10:49.149
Well, here's a second

10:45.770 --> 10:49.149
check for $77.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.318
-I am up one dollar.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.318
-Four more.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.236
How many silver dollars

10:51.359 --> 10:53.236
do you have?

10:53.278 --> 10:54.613
As many as it takes.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.114
Well, this checkbook

10:54.654 --> 10:56.114
is only on 304,

10:56.156 --> 10:57.991
so I can write checks

10:56.156 --> 10:57.991
all day long.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.117
Well, you know what?

10:58.032 --> 10:59.117
Here's my watch.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.868
-Yeah, melt this down.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.868
-Enough!

11:00.910 --> 11:02.579
I'm tired of being stuck

11:00.910 --> 11:02.579
in the middle of this.

11:02.621 --> 11:05.832
You figure out who gets

11:02.621 --> 11:05.832
the tickets and tell me.

11:05.873 --> 11:07.834
That should keep them

11:05.873 --> 11:07.834
busy for a little while.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.170
Hey, Jake, we've decided

11:07.875 --> 11:10.170
how to settle this.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.422
We're gonna duke

11:10.211 --> 11:12.422
it out in the ring.

11:12.464 --> 11:13.756
What?!

11:13.798 --> 11:16.759
That man is lying.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.804
I don't believe Wuntch

11:16.801 --> 11:19.804
had another rival.

11:19.846 --> 11:20.972
I saw it in her eyes.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.849
She only had hate for me.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.976
-Are you jealous?

11:22.890 --> 11:24.976
-Of course I am.

11:25.018 --> 11:28.104
I despised her

11:25.018 --> 11:28.104
with my entire being

11:28.146 --> 11:30.315
while she was only despising me

11:28.146 --> 11:30.315
with a fraction of hers?

11:30.357 --> 11:32.691
Sir, you were doing

11:30.357 --> 11:32.691
so well, OK?

11:32.733 --> 11:34.068
Don't let this rattle you.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.570
Are you wearing sponges

11:34.110 --> 11:35.570
in your armpits?

11:35.612 --> 11:36.863
If you have a better way

11:35.612 --> 11:36.863
to soak up sweat,

11:36.904 --> 11:37.822
I would like to hear it.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.157
Where are you going?

11:39.199 --> 11:42.577
To find out if there was...

11:39.199 --> 11:42.577
another man.

11:43.744 --> 11:45.872
-So, um, Adam, is it?

11:43.744 --> 11:45.872
-Mm-hmm.

11:45.913 --> 11:48.124
I only ask because Madeline

11:45.913 --> 11:48.124
never mentioned you.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.959
Interesting, 'cause she

11:48.166 --> 11:49.959
mentioned you to me--

11:50.001 --> 11:51.628
-as a friend.

11:50.001 --> 11:51.628
-Friend?

11:51.670 --> 11:53.338
-Mm.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.338
-I think you added an "R"

11:53.380 --> 11:55.256
-to the word "fiend."

11:53.380 --> 11:55.256
-No, I'm sure it was friend.

11:55.298 --> 11:57.050
I mean, based on

11:55.298 --> 11:57.050
context alone,

11:57.091 --> 11:58.677
I wouldn't say somebody was

11:57.091 --> 11:58.677
one of my closest fiends.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.136
Oh, you might.

12:00.178 --> 12:01.680
We had a very

12:00.178 --> 12:01.680
contentious relationship.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.557
She never forgave me

12:01.720 --> 12:03.557
for embarrassing her

12:03.598 --> 12:04.932
in front of Derek Jeter.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.601
Well, I embarrassed her

12:04.974 --> 12:06.601
in front of A-Rod

12:06.643 --> 12:08.603
and J.Lo<i> together.</i>

12:08.645 --> 12:10.980
For 15 years I replaced

12:08.645 --> 12:10.980
her anti-wrinkle cream

12:11.022 --> 12:12.315
with sour cream.

12:12.357 --> 12:14.442
I replaced her Lactaid pills

12:12.357 --> 12:14.442
with Tic Tacs.

12:14.484 --> 12:15.985
Dead moron was crapping

12:14.484 --> 12:15.985
her pants for months.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.487
She hacked into

12:16.027 --> 12:17.487
my Netflix account

12:17.529 --> 12:19.030
and watched the

12:17.529 --> 12:19.030
"Lizzie McGuire" movie

12:19.072 --> 12:20.781
on repeat to ruin

12:19.072 --> 12:20.781
my algorithm.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.116
She made me

12:20.823 --> 12:22.116
guard that doctor

12:22.158 --> 12:23.535
who came back

12:22.158 --> 12:23.535
to New York with Ebola!

12:23.577 --> 12:25.203
Sir, maybe you want

12:23.577 --> 12:25.203
to keep it down.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.954
-There's people--

12:25.245 --> 12:26.954
-That witch ruined my life!

12:26.996 --> 12:29.290
She demoted me from captain

12:26.996 --> 12:29.290
to uniformed officer.

12:29.332 --> 12:32.293
Eight years ago she

12:29.332 --> 12:32.293
had me kicked off

12:29.332 --> 12:32.293
the force entirely.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.087
You were not

12:32.335 --> 12:34.087
her greatest rival,

12:34.128 --> 12:35.714
and the proof is

12:34.128 --> 12:35.714
right here.

12:35.754 --> 12:36.839
Hello, Adam.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.425
I may be dying

12:38.466 --> 12:40.260
but I burned down

12:38.466 --> 12:40.260
your cabin in Maine.

12:40.301 --> 12:43.346
You were my one true rival.

12:43.388 --> 12:44.763
There you have it.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.477
I meant nothing to her.

12:49.519 --> 12:53.273
That cockroach Madeline

12:49.519 --> 12:53.273
was two-timing me!

12:55.609 --> 12:57.485
No sign of Holt anywhere.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.112
I know that's important,

12:57.527 --> 12:59.112
but I don't think

12:59.153 --> 13:00.988
I can just breeze past

12:59.153 --> 13:00.988
the outfit, "Sister Act."

13:01.030 --> 13:02.574
I sweat through my clothes

13:02.616 --> 13:04.075
and I found this in

13:02.616 --> 13:04.075
the back of a closet, OK?

13:04.117 --> 13:05.368
-Deal with it.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.368
-You look great.

13:05.410 --> 13:06.827
Oh, there he is.

13:05.410 --> 13:06.827
Sir, over here.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.538
[Rosa]

13:06.869 --> 13:08.538
Where were you?

13:08.580 --> 13:10.206
Why are you holding

13:08.580 --> 13:10.206
the mean yelling speech?

13:10.248 --> 13:11.790
Because I'm gonna

13:10.248 --> 13:11.790
yell it, meanly.

13:11.832 --> 13:15.086
I wasted half my life hating

13:11.832 --> 13:15.086
that duplicitous hag,

13:15.128 --> 13:16.588
and she didn't even

13:15.128 --> 13:16.588
have the decency

13:16.630 --> 13:18.005
to truly hate me back.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.716
Well, screw her.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.468
-I'm gonna ruin her memorial.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.468
-No, you can't do that.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.886
If you read that speech,

13:21.509 --> 13:23.886
you'll be fired.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.930
You're right.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.057
And that would

13:25.972 --> 13:28.057
ruin my career.

13:28.099 --> 13:29.934
And it's worth it.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.102
I'm giving the speech.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.688
No, that's what

13:31.144 --> 13:33.688
Wuntch wanted.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.898
-You're letting her win.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.898
-Sweaty Amy's right.

13:35.940 --> 13:36.983
If you really wanna

13:35.940 --> 13:36.983
get back at her,

13:37.024 --> 13:38.151
you'll team up

13:37.024 --> 13:38.151
with Adam

13:38.192 --> 13:39.486
and give her

13:38.192 --> 13:39.486
a nice funeral.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.070
It's like

13:39.527 --> 13:41.070
"The Durrells of Corfu"

13:41.112 --> 13:43.156
when Prudence and Louisa

13:41.112 --> 13:43.156
joined forces--

13:43.197 --> 13:45.325
To sink the catamaran

13:43.197 --> 13:45.325
of the bookseller Yorgos

13:45.366 --> 13:48.244
who wronged

13:45.366 --> 13:48.244
them both. Yes!

13:48.286 --> 13:51.289
I will team up

13:48.286 --> 13:51.289
with Adam.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.499
Wow.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.626
[laughs]

13:52.540 --> 13:54.626
For a moment there,

13:54.668 --> 13:57.253
I almost forgot who

13:54.668 --> 13:57.253
the real villain was.

13:57.295 --> 14:00.340
The woman who recently died.

13:57.295 --> 14:00.340
Mm.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.550
Charles, why did you

14:00.381 --> 14:02.550
let Terry choose boxing?

14:02.592 --> 14:04.010
He didn't.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.010
I picked it.

14:04.051 --> 14:06.137
-But... you'll die!

14:04.051 --> 14:06.137
-Don't worry about it.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.430
Boxing's in my blood.

14:07.472 --> 14:08.931
My Nana Boyle boxed

14:07.472 --> 14:08.931
in the Navy.

14:08.973 --> 14:12.059
I'm sure she did, but--

14:08.973 --> 14:12.059
and hear me out--

14:12.101 --> 14:13.770
what if you're not as strong

14:12.101 --> 14:13.770
as your Nana Boyle?

14:13.812 --> 14:15.104
I can handle myself.

14:15.146 --> 14:16.939
She taught me

14:15.146 --> 14:16.939
her signature punch:

14:16.981 --> 14:19.275
-the Strawberry Basket.

14:16.981 --> 14:19.275
-That does not reassure me.

14:19.317 --> 14:20.985
Hey there, big guy.

14:21.027 --> 14:24.405
You sure you're feeling OK

14:21.027 --> 14:24.405
about... ending Charles's life?

14:24.447 --> 14:26.115
Yep, my girls are

14:24.447 --> 14:26.115
gonna see this movie.

14:26.157 --> 14:28.201
Right, well, before you

14:26.157 --> 14:28.201
commit manslaughter,

14:28.242 --> 14:29.910
I do feel compelled

14:28.242 --> 14:29.910
to tell you that the movie

14:29.952 --> 14:31.579
only has a 38

14:29.952 --> 14:31.579
on Rotten Tomatoes.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.581
Jake, stop yapping

14:31.621 --> 14:33.581
and let 'em fight.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.500
I wanna see the big guy pop

14:33.623 --> 14:35.500
the little guy's head off.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.876
Yeah, let's start the fight!

14:36.917 --> 14:38.378
I wanna pop that

14:36.917 --> 14:38.378
little guy's head off!

14:38.419 --> 14:39.504
You're clearly

14:38.419 --> 14:39.504
the little guy.

14:39.546 --> 14:40.880
Ha ha!

14:39.546 --> 14:40.880
Good one, Jake.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.174
All right.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.174
I guess this is happening.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.092
Touch gloves.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.263
Charles, it's been very

14:46.553 --> 14:49.263
nice being your friend.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.724
Terry, I'll visit

14:49.305 --> 14:50.724
you in prison.

14:50.765 --> 14:52.851
And...

14:50.765 --> 14:52.851
[bell ringing]

14:52.892 --> 14:54.644
-Fight.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.644
-Strawberry basket!

14:54.686 --> 14:56.479
-[blow lands]

14:54.686 --> 14:56.479
-[groans]

14:56.521 --> 14:57.647
[Charles] Whoo, yeah!

14:57.689 --> 14:58.857
You mess with Grandma,

14:58.898 --> 15:00.483
you're gonna get the basket!

15:00.525 --> 15:01.735
[Jake]

15:00.525 --> 15:01.735
Charles, you punched

15:00.525 --> 15:01.735
him in the nards!

15:01.776 --> 15:03.152
Yeah, Nana fought nasty.

15:03.194 --> 15:04.779
Now if you don't mind,

15:03.194 --> 15:04.779
I'd like those tickets.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.573
I didn't hear no bell!

15:04.821 --> 15:06.573
[shouts]

15:06.614 --> 15:07.948
[grunts]

15:07.990 --> 15:10.034
Jake, I think those

15:07.990 --> 15:10.034
tickets are mine.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.746
-Strawberry basket!

15:10.076 --> 15:12.746
-[groans, coughs]

15:12.787 --> 15:15.956
Guys, stop!

15:12.787 --> 15:15.956
It's a movie about cupcakes!

15:15.998 --> 15:18.626
-You don't understand!

15:15.998 --> 15:18.626
-You don't have kids!

15:18.668 --> 15:20.127
[crying]

15:20.169 --> 15:22.505
Wow, that speech

15:20.169 --> 15:22.505
would have been amazing.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.591
I had to look up what

15:22.547 --> 15:24.591
a toilet ghost was.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.050
Oh, yes,

15:24.632 --> 15:26.050
I took a trip to Korea

15:26.092 --> 15:27.886
just to research

15:26.092 --> 15:27.886
new Wuntch insults.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.303
In fact it's been

15:27.927 --> 15:29.303
a motivation

15:29.345 --> 15:30.722
for most of my

15:29.345 --> 15:30.722
international travel.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.515
-Mm.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.515
-So you guys are friends now?

15:32.557 --> 15:34.768
Uh, yes, it seems we have

15:32.557 --> 15:34.768
a great deal in common.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.102
Well, one thing.

15:36.143 --> 15:37.520
[both laughing]

15:36.143 --> 15:37.520
Hating Wuntch.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.397
I read him the obituary

15:37.562 --> 15:39.397
I wrote for her,

15:39.439 --> 15:40.648
but the<i> Times</i>

15:39.439 --> 15:40.648
wouldn't publish it.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.024
It had too many

15:40.690 --> 15:42.024
obscenities.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.402
And I read him

15:42.066 --> 15:44.402
my all caps speech.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.571
And I loved it.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.571
It was like poetry.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.573
Madeline smelled

15:46.613 --> 15:48.573
like dog crap.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.409
Raymond convinced me

15:48.615 --> 15:51.409
the best way to get back

15:48.615 --> 15:51.409
at Wuntch

15:51.451 --> 15:53.119
is to make sure

15:51.451 --> 15:53.119
he doesn't get fired.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.622
Also I'm just gonna chisel

15:53.160 --> 15:55.622
a penis onto her headstone.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.206
And I'm gonna watch.

15:57.248 --> 15:58.499
-[both laughing]

15:57.248 --> 15:58.499
-[woman]<i> Please take your</i>

15:57.248 --> 15:58.499
<i>seats.</i>

15:58.541 --> 15:59.834
Well, uh, time

15:58.541 --> 15:59.834
for me to go

15:59.876 --> 16:01.419
make a tear-jerker

15:59.876 --> 16:01.419
of a speech.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.003
[Adam] Hey, I thought

16:01.461 --> 16:03.003
of the best hashtag

16:03.045 --> 16:04.422
to post with my photo

16:03.045 --> 16:04.422
of the grave penis.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.965
I'm not on board

16:04.464 --> 16:05.965
with that friendship.

16:06.006 --> 16:07.634
Yeah, there's something

16:06.006 --> 16:07.634
weird about that guy.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.176
Hey, when did he say he

16:07.675 --> 16:09.176
got kicked off the force?

16:09.218 --> 16:10.929
-Eight years ago.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.929
-That doesn't add up.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.055
He said Wuntch sent him

16:10.970 --> 16:13.055
to guard the Ebola doctor.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.808
-Wasn't that six years ago?

16:13.097 --> 16:14.808
-Yeah.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.183
Oh, my God.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.143
Wuntch sent him

16:16.225 --> 16:17.143
to destroy Holt.

16:17.184 --> 16:18.561
[Holt]

16:17.184 --> 16:18.561
Good afternoon.

16:18.603 --> 16:20.271
On this sad day,

16:20.313 --> 16:22.398
I'd like to say a few words

16:20.313 --> 16:22.398
about Commissioner Wuntch.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.734
Madeline smelled

16:22.440 --> 16:24.734
like dog crap.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.611
I'm... sorry.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.654
I--I don't know what--

16:27.695 --> 16:29.906
From a sick dog.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.906
[laughs]

16:29.948 --> 16:31.866
Adam, what are you doing?

16:31.908 --> 16:34.953
I'm showing everyone your

16:31.908 --> 16:34.953
true colors, Raymond Holt.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.913
Enjoy the show, people!

16:39.290 --> 16:41.793
Madeline Wuntch

16:39.290 --> 16:41.793
will not soon be forgotten.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.671
Trick-or-treaters will dress

16:41.835 --> 16:44.671
like her for generations.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.298
-Hey!

16:44.712 --> 16:47.298
-Diaz, delete all the videos.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.675
-[glass cracking]

16:47.340 --> 16:48.675
-Deleted.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.635
-It's over.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.635
-Yeah, for you.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.470
Everyone who's

16:50.677 --> 16:52.470
anyone in NYPD

16:52.512 --> 16:54.180
just saw you

16:52.512 --> 16:54.180
for your true self.

16:54.221 --> 16:57.517
-Your career is ruined,

16:54.221 --> 16:57.517
Ray-Ray.

16:54.221 --> 16:57.517
-Who are you?

16:57.558 --> 17:00.227
-Why are you doing this?

16:57.558 --> 17:00.227
-I'm Madeline Wuntch's nephew.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.521
She sent me here

17:00.269 --> 17:01.521
to carry out

17:01.562 --> 17:03.272
the final phase

17:01.562 --> 17:03.272
of her master plan,

17:03.314 --> 17:05.525
and now it's all over.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.525
Wait, why are you smiling?

17:05.566 --> 17:10.237
Because, Adam, this isn't

17:05.566 --> 17:10.237
the<i> real</i> memorial.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.782
-It's all a ruse.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.782
-What?

17:12.824 --> 17:13.783
Yeah, what?

17:13.825 --> 17:14.909
I knew Wuntch had one

17:14.951 --> 17:16.118
final trick up her sleeve.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.537
I didn't know what it was,

17:17.578 --> 17:19.121
so I had to be prepared

17:17.578 --> 17:19.121
for anything.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.290
This whole thing was staged.

17:21.332 --> 17:22.709
None of these people

17:21.332 --> 17:22.709
are real mourners.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.460
They're not even

17:22.750 --> 17:24.460
in the NYPD.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.671
-You hired actors?

17:24.502 --> 17:26.671
-Worse.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.089
They're members

17:26.713 --> 17:29.089
of local improv troupes,

17:29.131 --> 17:32.343
and they did it for,

17:29.131 --> 17:32.343
quote-unquote, "the exposure."

17:32.385 --> 17:34.261
This has been a blast,

17:34.303 --> 17:36.138
but we have to go

17:34.303 --> 17:36.138
start a flash mob

17:34.303 --> 17:36.138
at the Freedom Tower.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.016
-Oh, check out

17:36.180 --> 17:38.016
our YouTube channel.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.016
-No. Sit down.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.308
I have to hand it

17:38.057 --> 17:39.308
to you, Adam,

17:39.350 --> 17:40.643
you almost fooled me.

17:40.685 --> 17:42.186
But no other man

17:40.685 --> 17:42.186
could possibly

17:42.228 --> 17:43.521
have what

17:42.228 --> 17:43.521
Wuntch and I had.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.941
We were star-crossed haters.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.776
Whatever. I still inherit

17:46.983 --> 17:48.776
half her estate

17:48.818 --> 17:50.570
-just for trying this.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.570
-[Rosa] Cool.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.031
Who gets the other half

17:50.611 --> 17:53.031
of every child's nightmares?

17:53.072 --> 17:55.575
I love it, Rosa.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.575
Great work all day.

17:55.616 --> 17:59.370
So how are you two

17:55.616 --> 17:59.370
feeling after your

17:55.616 --> 17:59.370
little boxing match?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.789
-My head hurts.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.789
-I can't feel my strawberries.

18:01.831 --> 18:04.542
I meant more emotionally

18:01.831 --> 18:04.542
and less groin-ally.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.586
But listen, ever since

18:04.584 --> 18:06.586
I brought these tickets up,

18:06.627 --> 18:08.796
you guys have made my

18:06.627 --> 18:08.796
life absolutely miserable,

18:08.838 --> 18:11.173
but that ends now,

18:08.838 --> 18:11.173
because I've made a choice.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.550
Cagney is sick.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.550
We don't know how long she has.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.635
We do know for Nikolaj.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.635
She has 36 hours.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.554
Just stop, all right?

18:14.677 --> 18:16.554
Stop lying.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.472
This is exactly

18:16.596 --> 18:18.472
the type of behavior

18:18.514 --> 18:22.226
that has led me to decide that

18:18.514 --> 18:22.226
I'm not taking either of you.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.895
Seriously?

18:22.268 --> 18:23.895
Oh, man,

18:23.937 --> 18:25.396
the kids are gonna be

18:23.937 --> 18:25.396
so disappointed.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.815
No, they won't,

18:25.438 --> 18:27.815
because<i> they're</i> going.

18:27.857 --> 18:30.902
That's right, I'm bringing

18:27.857 --> 18:30.902
all three of them by myself

18:30.944 --> 18:32.486
and you two don't get to go.

18:32.528 --> 18:35.322
Your childish behavior

18:32.528 --> 18:35.322
has led you to miss out

18:35.364 --> 18:37.700
on the most exciting movie

18:35.364 --> 18:37.700
premiere event

18:37.742 --> 18:39.786
in the state of New York

18:37.742 --> 18:39.786
this Saturday.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.790
I hope you've learned

18:41.203 --> 18:43.790
your lesson.

18:43.831 --> 18:44.999
Good day.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.919
[sighs]

18:47.961 --> 18:49.963
Wait. He's taking

18:47.961 --> 18:49.963
the kids for us?

18:50.004 --> 18:51.380
It's just like getting

18:50.004 --> 18:51.380
a free babysitter.

18:51.422 --> 18:52.715
This is incredible.

18:52.757 --> 18:54.717
People without kids

18:52.757 --> 18:54.717
are so stupid!

18:54.759 --> 18:56.552
-They're gonna destroy him.

18:54.759 --> 18:56.552
-Yeah.

18:57.511 --> 18:58.805
So just to be clear,

18:58.846 --> 19:00.765
this service is actually real,

18:58.846 --> 19:00.765
right?

19:00.807 --> 19:03.017
Oh, yes. I figured if

19:00.807 --> 19:03.017
I needed two fake memorials

19:03.059 --> 19:05.061
to smoke out Wuntch's plan,

19:03.059 --> 19:05.061
she deserved to win.

19:05.103 --> 19:07.981
But she didn't win. I did.

19:05.103 --> 19:07.981
Finally beat the old fishwife.

19:08.022 --> 19:09.356
[Rosa]

19:08.022 --> 19:09.356
It's crazy.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.817
After today you never

19:09.398 --> 19:10.817
have to think

19:10.858 --> 19:12.401
about Madeline Wuntch again.

19:12.443 --> 19:13.694
Yes, I suppose

19:12.443 --> 19:13.694
you're right.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.488
Sir, does that

19:13.736 --> 19:15.488
make you sad?

19:15.529 --> 19:17.406
I don't know.

19:17.448 --> 19:20.576
I think maybe...

19:20.618 --> 19:22.161
yes?

19:22.202 --> 19:23.788
Well, I think it's natural

19:23.830 --> 19:25.915
to feel a little down

19:23.830 --> 19:25.915
about her death.

19:25.957 --> 19:29.460
For the last 20 years,

19:25.957 --> 19:29.460
your lives have been entangled.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.129
Because of her

19:29.502 --> 19:31.129
ratty hair.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.546
No, it's not the same.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.048
Now it just feels like

19:32.588 --> 19:34.048
I'm insulting

19:34.090 --> 19:35.925
-a helpless dead person.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.925
-You<i> are.</i>

19:35.967 --> 19:38.094
It's what you've been

19:35.967 --> 19:38.094
doing all week.

19:38.136 --> 19:39.553
Yeah, it's been tight.

19:41.388 --> 19:42.765
Well, it's time

19:41.388 --> 19:42.765
for my speech.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.976
Sir, what are

19:42.807 --> 19:44.976
you gonna say?

19:45.018 --> 19:46.602
I don't know.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.479
Maybe I'll just be honest.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.358
Did he say he was

19:50.982 --> 19:52.358
gonna be honest?

19:52.399 --> 19:53.442
Yeah, this is gonna

19:52.399 --> 19:53.442
be bad.

19:53.484 --> 19:54.777
As many of you know,

19:54.819 --> 19:57.196
Madeline and I

19:54.819 --> 19:57.196
were bitter rivals.

19:57.237 --> 19:58.572
But I've come to realize

19:58.614 --> 19:59.907
she held a special

19:58.614 --> 19:59.907
place in my life.

19:59.949 --> 20:03.619
No one challenged me

19:59.949 --> 20:03.619
like she did

20:03.661 --> 20:06.455
or made me feel as alive.

20:06.497 --> 20:09.917
Our relationship was like

20:06.497 --> 20:09.917
an epic chess match.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.922
And it's hard

20:11.627 --> 20:14.922
to believe that...

20:14.964 --> 20:16.674
she'll never make

20:14.964 --> 20:16.674
another move.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.885
[phone chimes]

20:18.926 --> 20:21.095
Unless...

20:22.262 --> 20:24.473
No, it's just

20:22.262 --> 20:24.473
a notification.

20:24.515 --> 20:26.392
Cheddar's doggy

20:24.515 --> 20:26.392
toothpaste has shipped.

20:26.433 --> 20:29.436
So... she is gone,

20:29.478 --> 20:31.438
and I wish she were not.

20:32.982 --> 20:35.776
I will miss you,

20:32.982 --> 20:35.776
Madeline Wuntch.

20:35.818 --> 20:37.028
[Jake groans]

20:37.070 --> 20:38.988
Wario, why are you like this?

20:39.030 --> 20:42.158
Hey, so I don't know

20:39.030 --> 20:42.158
if you noticed,

20:42.200 --> 20:44.744
but ever since I started

20:42.200 --> 20:44.744
those hormone treatments--

20:44.785 --> 20:46.120
I didn't notice anything.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.705
You said that

20:46.162 --> 20:47.705
way too quick.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.331
I mean, you did cry

20:47.747 --> 20:49.331
at that one car commercial

20:49.373 --> 20:50.750
and it wasn't even

20:49.373 --> 20:50.750
an emotional one.

20:50.791 --> 20:51.959
It was about towing capacity.

20:52.001 --> 20:54.587
Yeah. Well, I called

20:52.001 --> 20:54.587
the doctor

20:54.628 --> 20:57.131
to see if that was

20:54.628 --> 20:57.131
a common side effect,

20:57.173 --> 20:58.925
and apparently, it isn't.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.259
Oh, no.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.261
-Is everything OK?

21:00.300 --> 21:02.261
-Yeah.

21:02.302 --> 21:05.264
She did have one guess

21:02.302 --> 21:05.264
as to what might be causing it.

21:05.305 --> 21:07.725
And, um, she was right.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.979
[exhales]

21:12.021 --> 21:14.565
Ames.

21:14.607 --> 21:17.317
-Are we having a baby?

21:14.607 --> 21:17.317
-We're having a baby.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.070
-[laughs]

21:17.359 --> 21:19.070
-[exhales]

21:22.322 --> 21:23.365
It happened!

21:23.407 --> 21:25.492
-Not a doctor.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.492
-Shh.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.994
Fremulon.
