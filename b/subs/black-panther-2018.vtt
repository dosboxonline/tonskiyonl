00:04.000 --> 00:05.080
BOY: Baba...

00:05.240 --> 00:06.480
MAN: Yes, my son.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.040
BOY:
Tell me a story.

00:08.120 --> 00:10.320
Which one?

00:10.640 --> 00:12.560
The story of home.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.320
Millions of years ago...

00:16.480 --> 00:19.040
a meteorite
made of vibranium...

00:19.200 --> 00:21.520
the strongest substance
in the universe...

00:21.680 --> 00:23.600
struck the continent
of Africa...

00:25.760 --> 00:28.680
affecting the plant life
around it.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.880
And when
the time of man came...

00:31.040 --> 00:34.880
five tribes settled on it
and called it Wakanda.

00:37.560 --> 00:40.160
The tribes lived in constant
war with each other...

00:40.320 --> 00:42.480
until a warrior shaman...

00:42.680 --> 00:45.640
received a vision from
the Panther Goddess Bast...

00:45.800 --> 00:48.840
who led him
to the Heart-Shaped Herb...

00:49.520 --> 00:51.280
a plant that granted him

00:51.360 --> 00:55.360
superhuman strength,
speed and instincts.

00:55.520 --> 00:56.920
The warrior became king...

00:57.080 --> 00:59.480
and the first Black Panther...

00:59.640 --> 01:02.200
the protector of Wakanda.

01:02.360 --> 01:05.200
Four tribes agreed to live
under the king's rule...

01:05.360 --> 01:09.680
but the Jabari Tribe isolated
themselves in the mountains.

01:10.480 --> 01:13.520
The Wakandans used vibranium
to develop technology...

01:13.680 --> 01:16.960
more advanced
than any other nation.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.800
But as Wakanda thrived...

01:18.960 --> 01:22.360
the world around it descended
further into chaos.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.760
To keep vibranium safe...

01:27.920 --> 01:30.880
the Wakandans vowed
to hide in plain sight...

01:31.800 --> 01:33.720
keeping the truth
of their power

01:33.800 --> 01:35.800
from the outside world.

01:37.320 --> 01:39.200
And we still hide,  Baba?

01:40.160 --> 01:41.200
Yes.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.040
BOY: Why?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.760
BY TOO $HORT PLAYING)

01:53.960 --> 01:55.320
Lucky shot!
That ain't lucky!

01:55.480 --> 01:56.840
Whatever!
Get outta here!

01:56.960 --> 01:57.960
Check up.

01:58.040 --> 02:00.200
Pick your man up!
He open.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.400
Where you at?

02:02.560 --> 02:04.360
Let's go, let's go,
let's go.

02:04.560 --> 02:05.720
Pass! Pass!

02:05.880 --> 02:07.000
Got you, E.
E, hurry up!

02:07.160 --> 02:08.680
Watch me get this.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.640
Tim Hardaway style.
That's what I call it, baby.

02:11.720 --> 02:12.720
KID: Come on.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.800
BOY:
What you got?

02:13.880 --> 02:14.880
You ain't got nothing.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.920
MAN: Hey, look,
if we get in and out quick,

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
won't be no worries.

02:18.160 --> 02:20.160
You in the van,
come in through
from the west.

02:20.320 --> 02:21.480
Come around the corner.

02:21.560 --> 02:22.720
Land right here.
Mmm-hmm.

02:22.880 --> 02:24.520
Me and the twins
are pulling up
right here.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.800
We're leaving
this car behind,
okay? We come this...

02:31.200 --> 02:32.200
Hide the straps.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.560
Yo, is it the Feds?

02:45.440 --> 02:46.560
No.

02:58.520 --> 03:01.520
It's these two
Grace Jones-looking chicks.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.240
They're holding spears.

03:03.800 --> 03:04.760
Open it.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.640
JAMES: You serious?

03:07.240 --> 03:09.360
They won't knock again.

03:26.880 --> 03:28.240
Who are you?

03:28.400 --> 03:30.480
Prince N'Jobu,
son of Azzuri.

03:31.720 --> 03:34.680
Prove to me
you are one of us.

03:42.280 --> 03:43.480
My King.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.480
Leave us.

03:47.600 --> 03:50.600
This is James.
I trust him with
my life. He stays...

03:50.760 --> 03:52.880
with your permission,
King T'Chaka.

03:54.320 --> 03:55.480
As you wish.

03:55.640 --> 03:56.760
At ease.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.360
Come, baby brother.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.240
Let me see
how you are holding up.

04:20.240 --> 04:21.440
You look strong.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.520
Glory to Bast,
I am in good health.

04:23.600 --> 04:24.600
How is home?

04:27.560 --> 04:28.840
Not so good.

04:29.240 --> 04:30.800
Baby brother.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.360
There has been an attack.

04:32.760 --> 04:34.000
This man...

04:36.040 --> 04:37.080
Ulysses Klaue...

04:38.440 --> 04:40.480
stole a quarter ton of
vibranium from us...

04:40.640 --> 04:42.920
and triggered a bomb
at the border to escape.

04:45.240 --> 04:46.760
Many lives were lost.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.120
He knew where we hid
the vibranium...

04:50.280 --> 04:51.840
and how to strike.

04:52.440 --> 04:54.920
He had someone
on the inside.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.080
Why are you here?

04:57.600 --> 05:00.560
Because I want you
to look me in the eyes...

05:00.720 --> 05:03.640
and tell me
why you betrayed Wakanda.

05:03.800 --> 05:06.440
I did no such thing.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.400
Tell him who you are.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.840
Zuri, son of Badu...

05:13.040 --> 05:14.000
What?

05:19.680 --> 05:22.240
James. James,
you lied to me?

05:22.320 --> 05:23.320
Leave him.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.400
You were Wakandan
this whole time?

05:24.480 --> 05:25.480
You betrayed Wakanda!

05:25.560 --> 05:26.600
How could you lie
to me like...

05:26.720 --> 05:28.640
Stand down.

05:31.680 --> 05:35.560
Did you think that you were
the only spy we sent here?

05:47.560 --> 05:49.760
Prince N'Jobu...

05:49.920 --> 05:51.560
you will return home
at once...

05:51.720 --> 05:53.600
where you will face
the Council...

05:53.720 --> 05:56.400
and inform them
of your crimes.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.880
Check up!

06:02.600 --> 06:04.560
Guard your man,
guard your man!

06:05.880 --> 06:06.880
Yo.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.880
REPORTER:
The tiny nation of Wakanda

06:58.960 --> 07:01.840
is mourning the death
of its monarch, King T'Chaka.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.520
The beloved ruler was one of
many confirmed dead...

07:04.680 --> 07:05.760
after a terrorist attack

07:05.840 --> 07:07.520
at the United Nations
a week ago.

07:07.680 --> 07:10.840
The suspect
has since been apprehended.

07:10.920 --> 07:11.960
Though it remains one of

07:12.040 --> 07:13.200
the poorest countries
in the world...

07:13.360 --> 07:15.120
fortified by
mountain ranges...

07:15.240 --> 07:16.880
and an impenetrable
rainforest...

07:17.040 --> 07:19.120
Wakanda does not engage

07:19.200 --> 07:21.840
in international trade
or accept aid.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.280
The succession
of the throne...

07:23.440 --> 07:24.640
is expected to fall
to the oldest

07:24.720 --> 07:26.040
of the king's
two children...

07:26.200 --> 07:27.520
Prince T'Challa.

07:29.160 --> 07:30.400
OKOYE: My Prince...

07:30.560 --> 07:32.480
coming up on them now.

07:55.120 --> 07:57.920
No need, Okoye.
I can handle this alone.

07:59.240 --> 08:00.200
Hmm.

08:04.360 --> 08:07.120
I will get Nakia out
as quickly as possible.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.360
Just don't freeze
when you see her.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.080
What are you talking about?

08:16.120 --> 08:17.920
I never freeze.

08:33.960 --> 08:34.960
MILITANT 1: What's going on?

08:35.040 --> 08:38.600
MILITANT 2: It's the car.
It lost power. It won't start.

08:39.280 --> 08:40.840
The car no start.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.280
MILITANT 3: What happened?

08:42.360 --> 08:43.680
MILITANT 4: The engine failed.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.360
MILITANT 1: Ours, too.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.640
What is it, Captain?

09:01.160 --> 09:03.640
Defense positions.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.080
Defense positions.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.600
MILITANT 2:
Are we under attack?

09:06.760 --> 09:08.160
Defense positions.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.480
Get around to the side.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.520
Defense positions.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.840
Hey. Defense positions!

09:20.720 --> 09:21.840
No games.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.400
What do you see?

09:52.880 --> 09:54.960
Come in. Come in.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.480
Over there! Look back!

09:57.320 --> 09:58.320
Watch out!

10:24.120 --> 10:25.520
NAKIA: T'Challa, no!

10:26.320 --> 10:27.960
This one's just a boy.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.480
He got kidnapped as well.

10:31.560 --> 10:32.560
BLACK PANTHER:
Nakia...

10:36.960 --> 10:38.120
I...

10:40.520 --> 10:41.840
I wanted...
MILITANT 1: Hey!

10:42.000 --> 10:44.680
I have her!
Don't move!
I will shoot!

10:45.040 --> 10:46.560
I will shoot her right now.

10:54.280 --> 10:55.320
You froze.

10:55.840 --> 10:57.320
BLACK PANTHER: Ah...

11:00.000 --> 11:03.160
Why are you here?
You've ruined my mission.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.560
My father is dead, Nakia.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.760
I will be crowned king
tomorrow.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.800
And I wish for you
to be there.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.600
NAKIA:
Carry yourselves home now.

11:22.680 --> 11:23.680
WOMAN: Thank you.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.280
And take the boy.
Get him to his people.

11:25.440 --> 11:26.720
Thank you oh.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.560
You will speak
nothing of this day.

11:37.080 --> 11:38.080
Yes.

11:38.960 --> 11:39.960
Thank you.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Thank you.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.720
OKOYE: Sister Nakia...

12:19.120 --> 12:20.680
My Prince...

12:21.600 --> 12:23.120
we are home.

12:59.160 --> 13:01.040
This never gets old.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.240
Queen Mother...

13:58.000 --> 13:59.160
Princess...

13:59.560 --> 14:01.240
My comfort
for your loss.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.480
RAMONDA: Thank you, Nakia.

14:02.640 --> 14:05.280
It is so good
to have you back with us.

14:06.520 --> 14:07.520
Take her to
the River Province

14:07.600 --> 14:08.800
to prepare her
for the ceremony.

14:08.960 --> 14:10.160
Yes, General.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.400
Did he freeze?

14:20.880 --> 14:22.880
Like an antelope
in headlights.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.480
Are you finished?

14:30.200 --> 14:32.440
So surprised
my little sister came

14:32.520 --> 14:34.440
to see me off
before our big day.

14:34.640 --> 14:35.640
You wish!

14:35.720 --> 14:38.480
I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.840
Update? No.
It worked perfectly.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.480
How many times
do I have to teach you?

14:42.640 --> 14:43.840
Just because
something works

14:43.920 --> 14:45.640
doesn't mean
that it cannot be improved.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.960
You are teaching me?
What do you know?

14:48.920 --> 14:50.280
SHURI: More than you.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.920
I can't wait to see what kind
of update you make...

14:54.080 --> 14:55.960
to your ceremonial outfit.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.560
Shuri!

14:59.240 --> 15:00.360
Sorry, Mother!

15:01.240 --> 15:03.200
How are you
feeling today, Mama?

15:03.560 --> 15:04.720
Proud.

15:05.400 --> 15:09.480
Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.040
He is with us...

15:13.200 --> 15:16.240
and it is your time
to be king.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.080
Good morning.

15:37.680 --> 15:38.720
How can I help you?

15:38.880 --> 15:40.760
I was just checking out
these artifacts.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.040
They tell me
you're the expert.

15:42.120 --> 15:44.400
Ah. You could say that.

15:45.960 --> 15:47.240
They're beautiful.

15:49.360 --> 15:50.880
Where's this one from?

15:51.040 --> 15:52.480
The Bobo Ashanti tribe...

15:52.640 --> 15:53.920
present day Ghana...

15:54.080 --> 15:55.160
19th century.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.320
For real?

15:57.600 --> 15:59.320
What about this one?

16:01.160 --> 16:03.120
That one's from
the Edo people of Benin...

16:03.280 --> 16:05.200
16th century.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.320
Now, tell me about this one.

16:12.720 --> 16:15.280
Also from Benin,
seventh century.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.440
Fula tribe, I believe.

16:18.640 --> 16:19.920
Nah.

16:20.520 --> 16:21.760
I beg your pardon?

16:21.920 --> 16:23.800
It was taken by
British soldiers in Benin

16:23.920 --> 16:25.080
but it's from Wakanda.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.720
And it's made
out of vibranium.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.520
Don't trip.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.080
I'mma take it
off your hands for you.

16:33.480 --> 16:35.440
These items aren't for sale.

16:36.040 --> 16:38.200
How do you think
your ancestors got these?

16:38.360 --> 16:39.880
You think they paid
a fair price?

16:40.040 --> 16:42.200
Or did they take it,
like they took
everything else?

16:42.600 --> 16:44.280
Sir, I'm going to have to

16:44.360 --> 16:45.840
ask you to leave.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.520
You got all this
security in here

16:47.600 --> 16:49.080
watching me
ever since I walked in.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.640
But you ain't checking for

16:50.720 --> 16:52.760
what you put in your body.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.080
All right, mate.
Let's have it.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.720
Come on, mate. Time.

16:55.880 --> 16:57.360
I think she might not
be feeling too good.

16:58.320 --> 16:59.880
Somebody get some help!
Come here!

17:00.080 --> 17:02.720
Call a doctor, please!
Please, somebody, come help!

17:02.880 --> 17:03.920
GUARD: Medical emergency
right away

17:04.040 --> 17:05.400
in the West African Exhibit,
please, right away.

17:05.560 --> 17:06.560
Look out.

17:06.640 --> 17:09.280
Step back, please.
Step back. Thank you.

17:09.440 --> 17:12.160
Coming through over there.
Medics coming through.

17:13.080 --> 17:14.640
I'm gonna take a break.

17:18.360 --> 17:20.040
MEDIC 1: Let's give the lady
some space, please.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.240
MEDIC 2: Step back,
please, gents.

17:21.320 --> 17:22.640
Step back, please.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.400
Hey, come here.

17:28.560 --> 17:31.480
Come here. It's okay.

17:32.120 --> 17:35.360
You can go, but just don't
tell anyone, all right?

17:41.520 --> 17:42.960
Bro, why you ain't just
shoot him right here?

17:43.120 --> 17:44.080
Because it's better to leave

17:44.160 --> 17:45.200
the crime scene
more spread out.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.080
Makes us look
like amateurs.

18:03.520 --> 18:06.040
Now then,
let's see if you know

18:06.120 --> 18:07.720
what you're talking about.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.640
That's just a taste.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.080
You're gonna be a rich boy.

18:34.160 --> 18:35.320
You better sell that quick.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.120
It's already sold!

18:37.960 --> 18:38.960
Whatever you try,

18:39.040 --> 18:40.040
the Wakandans'll
probably show up.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.600
That'll make my day.

18:41.680 --> 18:42.960
I can kill two birds
with one stone.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.400
You're not telling me
that's vibranium, too?

18:47.600 --> 18:49.360
Nah, I'm just feeling it.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.040
Onward!

19:32.400 --> 19:33.520
Onward!

20:51.520 --> 20:53.040
I, Zuri...

20:53.760 --> 20:55.320
son of Badu...

20:55.640 --> 20:57.240
give to you...

20:57.440 --> 20:59.600
Prince T'Challa...

20:59.760 --> 21:01.480
the Black Panther!

21:06.480 --> 21:08.000
The prince...

21:08.200 --> 21:12.760
will now have the strength
of the Black Panther...

21:12.960 --> 21:15.200
stripped away.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.040
Praise the ancestors.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.520
Praise the ancestors.

21:50.720 --> 21:54.640
Victory in ritual combat...

21:54.800 --> 21:58.360
comes by yield or death.

21:58.520 --> 22:02.080
If any tribe wishes to
put forth a warrior...

22:02.240 --> 22:04.080
I now offer...

22:04.720 --> 22:07.680
a path to the throne.

22:11.480 --> 22:16.120
The Merchant Tribe
will not challenge today.

22:18.080 --> 22:22.200
The Border Tribe
will not challenge today.

22:24.920 --> 22:27.960
The River Tribe
will not challenge today.

22:30.240 --> 22:32.920
The Mining Tribe
will not challenge today.

22:33.120 --> 22:36.000
Is there any member
of a royal blood...

22:36.800 --> 22:40.080
who wishes to challenge
for the throne?

22:43.840 --> 22:46.640
This corset
is really uncomfortable...

22:46.840 --> 22:50.080
so could we all just
wrap it up and go home?

22:50.720 --> 22:51.760
Mother!

23:16.640 --> 23:18.640
Are they Jabari?
Yes.

23:27.600 --> 23:30.360
M'Baku, what are you
doing here?

23:32.240 --> 23:34.480
It's challenge day.

23:39.720 --> 23:41.320
We have watched...

23:42.160 --> 23:44.480
and listened
from the mountains!

23:44.640 --> 23:46.600
We have watched
with disgust...

23:46.760 --> 23:49.560
as your
technological advancements

23:49.640 --> 23:51.720
have been overseen
by a child!

23:55.400 --> 23:57.760
Who scoffs at tradition!

23:58.560 --> 24:01.440
And now you want to
hand the nation

24:01.520 --> 24:03.440
over to this prince...

24:04.240 --> 24:09.560
who could not keep
his own father safe.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.160
Mmm?

24:14.520 --> 24:16.240
We will not have it.

24:16.400 --> 24:20.480
I said,
we will not have it, oh!

24:20.680 --> 24:23.160
I, M'Baku...

24:24.640 --> 24:26.440
leader of the Jabari...

24:26.600 --> 24:30.880
I accept your challenge,
M'Baku.

24:32.160 --> 24:34.080
Glory to Hanuman.

24:52.160 --> 24:54.360
Jabari!

24:55.080 --> 24:56.080
Dora Milaje!

24:56.560 --> 24:57.480
Onward!

25:04.680 --> 25:07.440
Let the challenge begin!

25:18.760 --> 25:20.080
Oh!

25:22.800 --> 25:23.800
M'BAKU: Stand up!

25:33.080 --> 25:34.800
Come!

25:42.280 --> 25:44.360
WOMAN: T'Challa!

25:49.480 --> 25:51.040
Where is your god now?

26:01.440 --> 26:03.040
Yes!

26:10.800 --> 26:12.600
No powers.

26:12.960 --> 26:14.400
No claws.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.360
No special suit, oh!

26:17.520 --> 26:20.560
Just a boy not fit to lead!

26:20.760 --> 26:23.760
Show him who you are!

26:40.200 --> 26:42.000
I am Prince T'Challa...

26:42.200 --> 26:43.760
son of King T'Chaka!

26:43.960 --> 26:45.560
You can do this,
T'Challa!

26:59.360 --> 27:00.360
Yes!

27:00.920 --> 27:01.920
Come on!

27:02.080 --> 27:04.240
Yield!
Don't make me kill you.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.000
I would rather die!

27:09.440 --> 27:10.400
T'Challa!

27:11.640 --> 27:12.640
T'Challa!

27:13.360 --> 27:14.400
T'Challa!

27:15.400 --> 27:16.400
T'Challa!

27:17.200 --> 27:18.240
T'Challa!

27:18.320 --> 27:19.440
You have fought with honor!

27:19.600 --> 27:22.200
Now yield!
Your people need you.

27:22.360 --> 27:23.360
T'Challa!

27:23.760 --> 27:24.760
T'Challa!

27:24.840 --> 27:26.000
Yield, man!

27:26.200 --> 27:27.440
T'Challa!

27:27.840 --> 27:28.840
T'Challa!

27:30.680 --> 27:33.200
Yes! Yes!

27:54.760 --> 27:57.360
ZURI: I now present to you...

27:57.520 --> 27:59.840
King T'Challa...

28:01.560 --> 28:04.440
the Black Panther.

28:10.440 --> 28:11.560
Zuri.

28:12.480 --> 28:13.680
My King.

28:24.360 --> 28:26.000
Wakanda forever!

28:26.160 --> 28:28.240
ALL: Wakanda forever!

29:00.520 --> 29:02.200
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...

29:02.360 --> 29:05.520
to restore the powers
of the Black Panther...

29:06.560 --> 29:09.600
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.160
ZURI: T'Chaka...

29:14.320 --> 29:17.360
we call on you.

29:17.520 --> 29:20.400
Come here to your son.

29:33.160 --> 29:34.360
Praise the ancestors.

31:04.360 --> 31:05.240
Father.

31:05.760 --> 31:06.920
My son.

31:16.280 --> 31:17.760
I'm sorry.

31:17.920 --> 31:19.720
T'CHAKA: Stand up.

31:19.880 --> 31:22.080
You are a king.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.960
What is wrong my son?

31:39.400 --> 31:41.760
I am not ready.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.960
Have you not prepared

31:45.120 --> 31:49.320
to be king
your whole life?

31:49.760 --> 31:53.040
Have you not trained
and studied,

31:53.360 --> 31:56.040
been by my side?

31:58.200 --> 32:00.480
That is not
what I am talking about.

32:04.440 --> 32:07.600
I am not ready
to be without you.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.760
A man who has not prepared
his children

32:11.840 --> 32:13.400
for his own death...

32:13.560 --> 32:15.720
has failed as a father.

32:15.880 --> 32:18.440
Have I ever failed you?

32:19.120 --> 32:20.440
Never.

32:25.480 --> 32:28.720
Tell me how to
best protect Wakanda.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.440
I want to be
a great king, Baba.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.400
Just like you.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.000
You're going to struggle.

32:39.160 --> 32:41.000
So you'll need to
surround yourself

32:41.080 --> 32:42.800
with people you trust.

32:42.960 --> 32:46.200
You're a good man
with a good heart.

32:47.280 --> 32:49.720
And it's hard
for a good man to be king.

32:54.240 --> 32:55.520
Breathe.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.240
T'Challa, breathe.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.360
Breathe.

33:02.320 --> 33:03.920
He was there.

33:05.560 --> 33:08.680
He was there.
My father.

33:24.560 --> 33:25.560
Just one?

33:32.400 --> 33:34.240
Come home, Nakia.

33:34.400 --> 33:35.640
I'm right here.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.280
Stay.

33:37.920 --> 33:41.440
I came to support you
and to honor your father...

33:41.560 --> 33:42.960
but I can't stay.

33:44.800 --> 33:46.960
I found
my calling out there.

33:47.680 --> 33:50.600
I've seen too many in need
just to turn a blind eye.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.600
I can't be happy here...

33:52.800 --> 33:55.480
knowing that there's people
out there who have nothing.

33:56.960 --> 33:59.520
What would you have
Wakanda do about it?

34:00.240 --> 34:01.840
Share what we have.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.520
We could provide aid...

34:03.680 --> 34:04.680
and access to technology

34:04.760 --> 34:05.960
and refuge
to those who need it.

34:06.320 --> 34:08.600
Other countries do it,
we could do it better.

34:10.240 --> 34:13.160
We are not like
these other countries, Nakia.

34:14.760 --> 34:16.280
If the world found out
what we truly are...

34:16.440 --> 34:17.920
what we possess...

34:18.080 --> 34:19.760
we could lose
our way of life.

34:19.920 --> 34:22.200
Wakanda is strong enough
to help others

34:22.320 --> 34:24.120
and protect ourselves
at the same time.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.800
If you were not so stubborn,
you would make a great queen.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.480
I would make a great queen
because I am so stubborn.

34:31.640 --> 34:35.160
Ah! See, you admit it!
If that's what I wanted.

34:42.360 --> 34:43.920
T'CHALLA: Is that him?

34:46.120 --> 34:49.160
Glory to Bast, man.
Is he still growing?

34:50.680 --> 34:51.680
W'KABI: Of course.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.520
I see Nakia is back.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.200
You guys going to work it out?

35:03.520 --> 35:04.600
T'Challa...

35:05.320 --> 35:06.840
what's wrong?

35:07.040 --> 35:08.600
Nakia thinks
we should be doing more.

35:08.760 --> 35:09.760
More, like what?

35:09.920 --> 35:12.200
Foreign aid,
refugee programs.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.240
You let the refugees in...

35:14.920 --> 35:16.880
they bring their problems
with them.

35:17.040 --> 35:19.320
And then Wakanda
is like everywhere else.

35:21.280 --> 35:24.040
Now if you said
you wanted me and my men...

35:25.000 --> 35:26.720
to go out there
and clean up the world,

35:26.800 --> 35:28.400
then I'll be all for it.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.800
But waging war
on other countries

35:30.880 --> 35:32.480
has never been our way.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.240
You, too, huh?

35:38.400 --> 35:40.040
Bast! We're in trouble.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.200
My King.

35:45.120 --> 35:46.080
My love.

35:46.280 --> 35:49.680
You will never guess
who just popped up
on our radar.

35:53.480 --> 35:55.280
A misidentified
Wakandan artifact...

35:55.440 --> 35:58.160
was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.

35:59.440 --> 36:02.440
We have learned
Ulysses Klaue...

36:02.640 --> 36:05.440
plans to sell the vibranium
to an American buyer...

36:05.640 --> 36:06.960
in South Korea...

36:07.120 --> 36:08.560
tomorrow night.

36:10.240 --> 36:14.120
Klaue has escaped our pursuits
for almost 30 years.

36:15.080 --> 36:18.560
Not capturing him is, perhaps,
my father's greatest regret.

36:18.720 --> 36:21.800
I wish to bring Klaue
back here to stand trial.

36:21.960 --> 36:26.600
Wakanda does not need
a warrior right now.

36:27.040 --> 36:28.000
We need a king.

36:28.200 --> 36:30.800
My parents were killed
when he attacked.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.680
Not a day goes by
when I do not think

36:33.760 --> 36:35.840
about what Klaue
took from us.

36:37.480 --> 36:38.480
From me.

36:38.840 --> 36:41.600
It's too great
an opportunity to pass.

36:41.800 --> 36:42.920
W'KABI: Take me with you.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
We'll take him down together,
side by side.

36:45.160 --> 36:48.200
I need you here
protecting the border.

36:48.360 --> 36:49.640
Then I ask...

36:49.800 --> 36:51.920
you kill him
where he stands...

36:52.080 --> 36:54.160
or you bring him
back to us.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.480
You have my word.

36:58.200 --> 37:00.360
I will bring him back.

37:01.800 --> 37:03.840
We will proceed
with the mission.

37:49.880 --> 37:50.880
My King!

37:51.040 --> 37:52.760
Stop it. Stop it.

37:55.520 --> 37:57.960
I've already sent a car ahead
to Busan for you.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.440
Who are you taking
with you to Korea?

38:00.880 --> 38:01.960
Okoye.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.560
And Nakia as well.

38:06.440 --> 38:10.200
You sure it's a good idea
to take your ex on a mission?

38:10.680 --> 38:11.760
Yes.

38:12.920 --> 38:13.960
We'll be fine.

38:14.040 --> 38:15.960
Besides, you'll be on call
should we need backup.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.280
Yes!

38:17.480 --> 38:19.840
I have great things
to show you, Brother.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.400
Here are your communication
devices for Korea.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.880
Unlimited range,

38:24.960 --> 38:27.720
also equipped with
audio surveillance system.

38:27.880 --> 38:29.240
Check these out.

38:30.560 --> 38:33.520
Remote access
Kimoyo Beads.

38:33.720 --> 38:36.480
Updated to interface directly
with my sand table.

38:36.960 --> 38:38.200
Ah.

38:39.240 --> 38:40.320
And what are these?

38:40.480 --> 38:43.400
The real question is
what are those?

38:44.560 --> 38:46.040
Why do you have
your toes out in my lab?

38:46.200 --> 38:48.240
What, you don't like
my royal sandals?

38:48.400 --> 38:51.200
I wanted to go old school
for my first day.

38:51.360 --> 38:53.280
I bet the Elders loved that.

38:54.560 --> 38:55.560
Try them on.

38:59.640 --> 39:00.680
Fully automated.

39:01.080 --> 39:03.360
Like the old American movie
Baba  used to watch.

39:03.440 --> 39:04.440
Mmm.

39:04.520 --> 39:06.680
And I made them
completely sound absorbent.

39:08.840 --> 39:09.840
Interesting.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.760
Guess what I call them.

39:11.920 --> 39:13.320
Sneakers.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.240
Because you...

39:16.400 --> 39:17.560
Never mind.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.440
If you're going to take
on Klaue...

39:20.600 --> 39:24.800
you'll need the best
the design group
has to offer.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.080
Exhibit A.

39:26.240 --> 39:27.800
T'CHALLA: My design.
SHURI: Old tech.

39:27.960 --> 39:30.240
Old?
Functional, but old.

39:30.400 --> 39:32.080
"Hey, people are
shooting at me.

39:32.160 --> 39:34.120
"Wait, let me put on
my helmet."

39:34.280 --> 39:35.880
Enough.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.920
Now, look at these.

39:41.680 --> 39:42.880
Do you like that one?

39:43.040 --> 39:44.320
Tempting.

39:45.200 --> 39:47.560
But the idea
is to not be noticed.

39:49.400 --> 39:50.400
This one.

39:57.400 --> 39:59.080
Now tell it to go on.

40:04.400 --> 40:05.600
Ooh!

40:06.520 --> 40:09.840
The entire suit sits within
the teeth of the necklace.

40:10.720 --> 40:12.160
Strike it.

40:12.760 --> 40:14.320
Anywhere?
Mmm-hmm.

40:17.920 --> 40:19.440
Not that hard, genius!

40:19.640 --> 40:21.840
You told me to strike it.
You didn't say how hard.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.280
I invite you to my lab,

40:23.360 --> 40:24.840
and you just
kick things around?

40:25.000 --> 40:27.720
Well, maybe
you should make it
a little stronger.

40:27.800 --> 40:28.840
Hey.

40:28.920 --> 40:30.480
Wait a minute.

40:30.640 --> 40:33.360
SHURI: The nanites
absorb the kinetic energy...

40:33.520 --> 40:35.920
and hold it in place
for redistribution.

40:36.080 --> 40:37.440
Very nice.

40:37.560 --> 40:40.240
Strike it again
in the same spot.

40:42.880 --> 40:44.400
You're recording?

40:45.000 --> 40:46.720
For research purposes.

40:54.200 --> 40:55.600
Delete that footage.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.000
This way.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.600
Bast willing,
this will go quickly...

41:21.760 --> 41:24.760
and I can
get this ridiculous
thing off my head.

41:24.960 --> 41:28.160
It looks nice.
Just whip it back
and forth.

41:28.320 --> 41:31.000
What?
It's a disgrace.

41:32.960 --> 41:34.640
Hello Sophia.

41:34.920 --> 41:37.160
Good to see you.

41:38.440 --> 41:40.040
Who are these two?

41:40.200 --> 41:42.240
My friends
from Kenya.

41:42.320 --> 41:44.800
Very deep pockets.
They're good.

41:45.200 --> 41:47.680
Good for trouble...

41:47.840 --> 41:49.440
...like you?

41:58.280 --> 41:59.720
Thank you!

42:22.560 --> 42:23.840
Spread out.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.400
The buyer
is likely already here.

42:44.200 --> 42:45.920
The woman outside.

42:46.640 --> 42:49.080
What trouble
was she referring to?

42:49.160 --> 42:51.960
Ah... I got into
a disagreement

42:52.040 --> 42:53.880
with some ivory traders.

42:54.040 --> 42:56.080
Made a bit of a mess.
Hmm.

42:56.160 --> 42:58.320
And will there be
any trouble tonight,

42:58.400 --> 43:00.320
Ms. Kenyan Heiress?

43:00.480 --> 43:01.720
Depends...

43:01.880 --> 43:04.080
on how quickly we finish
the mission.

43:04.240 --> 43:06.080
Can we please focus?

43:07.840 --> 43:09.120
Thank you.

43:10.760 --> 43:11.760
Over here.

43:12.480 --> 43:14.320
One whiskey, please.

43:24.920 --> 43:27.680
Eyes up. Americans.

43:31.320 --> 43:32.480
I count three.

43:34.720 --> 43:35.880
OKOYE: Five.

43:36.040 --> 43:37.360
How could you miss
Greased Lightning

43:37.440 --> 43:38.720
there behind you?

43:38.880 --> 43:40.000
Six.

43:40.160 --> 43:43.600
Just spotted an old friend
who works for the CIA.

43:43.760 --> 43:46.360
It just got
a little more complicated.

43:49.680 --> 43:50.800
Agent Ross.

43:50.960 --> 43:52.080
Your Highness.

43:52.600 --> 43:54.160
You are buying from Klaue.

43:56.120 --> 43:57.880
What I'm doing
or not doing...

43:58.040 --> 43:59.480
on behalf of
the U.S. government

43:59.560 --> 44:00.760
is none of your concern.

44:00.920 --> 44:02.600
Now, whatever the hell
you're up to...

44:02.760 --> 44:04.840
do me a favor,
stay out of my way.

44:05.040 --> 44:06.280
I gave you Zemo.

44:06.480 --> 44:07.840
Didn't I keep it
under wraps...

44:08.000 --> 44:09.600
that the king of
a third world country

44:09.680 --> 44:11.640
runs around
in a bulletproof cat suit?

44:11.800 --> 44:13.200
I'd say we were even.

44:13.360 --> 44:14.960
You really need
to leave, now.

44:15.560 --> 44:18.920
Klaue is leaving
out that door with me.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.600
You've been warned.

44:23.520 --> 44:24.560
CROUPIER: Three, craps.

44:25.200 --> 44:26.440
Hey, you won!

44:28.040 --> 44:29.320
You know what?

44:29.520 --> 44:31.520
I think
I'll just take these...

44:31.680 --> 44:33.360
bring them over here

44:33.480 --> 44:35.800
and hold on for safekeeping.
ROSS: Mmm-hmm.

44:38.440 --> 44:41.520
Okay, heads up.
The king of Wakanda is here.

44:41.680 --> 44:43.400
He cannot leave with Klaue.

44:44.920 --> 44:45.920
All right.

44:46.080 --> 44:47.440
Vibranium from the attack
on Sokovia

44:47.520 --> 44:48.520
links back to a person...

44:48.680 --> 44:49.800
that I'm not actually saying

44:49.880 --> 44:50.880
I'm here to make
a deal with...

44:51.080 --> 44:53.440
but that deal
will not be called off.

44:53.600 --> 44:54.880
When the dust settles,

44:54.960 --> 44:56.480
you and me can work
something out.

44:56.640 --> 44:58.520
I'm not here
to make a deal.

45:25.440 --> 45:27.480
Klaue, plus eight!

45:27.800 --> 45:28.760
General.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.840
In position
to secure our exit.

45:30.960 --> 45:32.000
And the vibranium?

45:32.120 --> 45:33.760
I don't see it yet.

45:33.920 --> 45:36.520
OKOYE: I thought there were
no weapons allowed in here.

45:36.680 --> 45:38.440
There's not supposed to be.

45:38.600 --> 45:41.000
Somebody did not
get the memo.

45:41.920 --> 45:43.480
Definitely armed.

45:44.320 --> 45:46.200
Well, that is quite
the entourage.

45:46.360 --> 45:47.520
You got a mixtape
coming out?

45:47.720 --> 45:50.320
Yeah, actually, there is one.

45:50.480 --> 45:52.400
I'll send you the SoundCloud
link, if you like.

45:52.600 --> 45:53.880
Hey, Dave, can you get
the link to the tape?

45:54.040 --> 45:55.640
Please, don't make me
listen to your music.

45:55.800 --> 45:57.560
I just meant you
got a lot of
people with you.

45:58.400 --> 46:00.120
You think they're for you?

46:01.280 --> 46:02.440
Don't worry.

46:02.600 --> 46:04.480
I can do a deal with you
all by myself,

46:04.560 --> 46:05.720
thank you very much.

46:13.120 --> 46:15.600
OKOYE: Six more.
It's a setup.

46:16.320 --> 46:17.840
You got the diamonds?

46:18.560 --> 46:20.320
Okay. That's enough.

46:22.560 --> 46:24.840
We need to move on Klaue.
T'CHALLA: Stand down.

46:25.240 --> 46:26.920
We can't afford a shootout.

46:27.080 --> 46:28.080
Vibranium?

46:37.440 --> 46:39.560
I was going to buy
a fancy suitcase...

46:39.720 --> 46:42.200
but I thought
I'd save myself some money.

46:42.680 --> 46:44.320
It's now or never.

46:44.480 --> 46:45.600
Stand down!

46:46.040 --> 46:46.880
Hey!

47:00.800 --> 47:02.160
Wakandans! They're here!

47:04.600 --> 47:06.200
ROSS: Get outta here!
KLAUE: Kill 'em all!

47:08.080 --> 47:09.440
Diamonds, quick!

48:06.240 --> 48:07.280
Murderer!

48:13.800 --> 48:16.160
You know, you look just like
your old man.

48:28.080 --> 48:29.800
Let's get out
of here, boss!

48:33.600 --> 48:36.480
That was awesome!
That was awesome!

48:36.680 --> 48:39.200
Let's go! Go, go, go, come on!

48:41.080 --> 48:43.600
Do we just leave him?
He'll catch up.

48:51.840 --> 48:52.960
Shuri!

48:56.560 --> 48:57.560
Yes!

48:57.680 --> 49:00.120
AUTOMATED VOICE: Remote
driving system activated.

49:00.960 --> 49:02.640
Wait! Which side of
the road is it?

49:02.720 --> 49:03.840
T'CHALLA: For Bast's sake!

49:04.040 --> 49:05.360
Just drive!
Okay, calm down!

49:13.600 --> 49:15.320
Whoo! Let's go!

49:15.480 --> 49:17.720
Put some music on.
What do you think
this is, a funeral?

49:21.320 --> 49:22.800
Which one is he in now?

49:25.120 --> 49:26.480
Hey, split up!

49:28.240 --> 49:29.800
They're trying to lose us.
I'll take the right.

49:32.120 --> 49:34.640
We'll take the other two!
I see a shortcut.

49:50.800 --> 49:51.920
We're not going to make it!

49:53.560 --> 49:54.640
BLACK PANTHER: Keep going!

50:00.880 --> 50:02.760
Whoo! Brother!

50:12.440 --> 50:13.760
Hey, what was that?

50:13.920 --> 50:15.920
BLACK PANTHER: Don't worry
about it. You're doing great.

50:27.320 --> 50:28.440
Guns.

50:29.720 --> 50:31.000
So primitive!

50:31.160 --> 50:33.000
It's a vibranium car,
you idiots!

50:33.080 --> 50:34.240
The bullets
won't penetrate!

50:36.440 --> 50:37.480
What are you doing?

50:37.680 --> 50:38.880
Just drive.

50:55.560 --> 50:56.960
Whoo!
Shit!

51:10.280 --> 51:11.960
Hey, look at your suit.

51:12.120 --> 51:13.240
You've been taking bullets,

51:13.320 --> 51:15.200
charging it up
with kinetic energy.

51:17.080 --> 51:18.280
BLACK PANTHER:
Pull around the truck.

51:23.120 --> 51:24.320
Where'd he go?

51:33.760 --> 51:35.080
You show-off.

51:36.360 --> 51:37.360
There he is!

51:39.760 --> 51:40.760
Hold tight!

51:44.640 --> 51:45.720
All right.
Let's have some fun!

52:14.040 --> 52:15.080
Hop in.

52:15.600 --> 52:17.960
Put that spear
in the trunk.

52:23.200 --> 52:24.320
BLACK PANTHER: Faster, Shuri.

52:24.480 --> 52:26.120
I'm going as fast as I can!

52:27.760 --> 52:28.960
Take a right! Take a right!

52:33.640 --> 52:34.720
No, no, no!

52:36.400 --> 52:38.200
Brother!

53:01.720 --> 53:02.760
BLACK PANTHER: Klaue!

53:04.920 --> 53:06.520
Did you think
we would forget?

53:15.640 --> 53:17.480
Look at me, murderer!

53:18.520 --> 53:19.920
Where did you get this weapon?

53:20.280 --> 53:22.760
You savages
didn't deserve it.

53:25.400 --> 53:28.880
Oh, mercy, King. Mercy.

53:29.040 --> 53:31.160
Every breath you take
is mercy from me.

53:31.320 --> 53:32.600
King!

53:33.200 --> 53:35.080
The world watches.

53:35.240 --> 53:37.160
Come on. Guys.
Let's go, huh?

53:43.200 --> 53:44.240
Yeah.

53:58.640 --> 53:59.920
KLAUE: Hello.

54:02.800 --> 54:05.560
I can see you! I can.
I can see you.

54:13.800 --> 54:15.520
So this is
a big mess, huh?

54:15.680 --> 54:17.880
I figured we could go
good cop, bad cop.

54:18.040 --> 54:19.360
I'll talk to him first,
then you guys go in.

54:20.600 --> 54:23.360
We can't let him
talk to Klaue alone.

54:26.400 --> 54:29.400
Better to let him talk to
Klaue alone for 5 minutes

54:29.480 --> 54:32.400
than to make
a scene here.

54:33.400 --> 54:34.840
After your questioning,

54:34.960 --> 54:36.880
we will take him back
to Wakanda with us.

54:37.040 --> 54:39.560
What? No. Look,
I like you, a lot.

54:39.720 --> 54:42.520
But he's in my custody now.
He's not going anywhere.

54:42.680 --> 54:44.360
Listen, I'm doing
you guys a favor

54:44.440 --> 54:46.040
by letting you
even be in here.

54:49.360 --> 54:50.880
If he touches you again,

54:51.080 --> 54:53.800
I'm going to impale him
to this desk.

54:54.720 --> 54:56.040
Does she speak English?

54:56.400 --> 54:58.120
When she wants to.

54:58.960 --> 55:00.000
Huh.

55:00.080 --> 55:01.120
I'm going in.

55:01.200 --> 55:03.400
When I'm done,
you guys are up.

55:03.560 --> 55:05.360
Agent Ross.
Yeah?

55:05.880 --> 55:08.800
I do appreciate your help
in Busan.

55:09.360 --> 55:10.560
You see that?

55:11.160 --> 55:12.320
It's called diplomacy.

55:13.440 --> 55:14.440
You're welcome.

55:14.520 --> 55:16.560
BY DEE DEE HALLIGAN
AND JUNIOR TORELLO)

55:16.640 --> 55:18.720
Okoye.

55:18.800 --> 55:19.920
Play nice.

55:20.080 --> 55:21.160
Americans.

55:33.200 --> 55:35.120
You know,
you really shouldn't
trust the Wakandans.

55:35.280 --> 55:36.600
I'm much more your speed.

55:36.760 --> 55:38.600
I don't trust anybody,
not in this job.

55:38.760 --> 55:41.240
But what I am interested in
is that arm cannon out there.

55:41.440 --> 55:42.600
Where'd you get that?

55:42.760 --> 55:44.480
It's an old mining tool that
I made some adjustments to.

55:44.640 --> 55:47.000
But I can get you one,
if you like.

55:47.200 --> 55:49.040
Why don't you
give me the name
of your supplier,

55:49.120 --> 55:50.200
and I'll ask them.

55:50.360 --> 55:51.800
He's right outside.

55:51.960 --> 55:53.560
Why don't you
ask him yourself?

55:53.720 --> 55:55.200
What? T'Challa?

55:55.400 --> 55:58.680
You're telling me that weapon
on your arm is from Wakanda?

55:58.840 --> 55:59.840
Bingo.

56:01.160 --> 56:04.200
What do you actually know
about Wakanda?

56:04.360 --> 56:05.600
Um...

56:06.800 --> 56:08.880
Shepherds, textiles,
cool outfits.

56:09.040 --> 56:10.320
It's all a front.

56:10.960 --> 56:13.520
Explorers searched for it
for centuries.

56:13.720 --> 56:16.160
El Dorado, the Golden City.

56:16.320 --> 56:18.680
They thought they could
find it in South America...

56:18.840 --> 56:21.720
but it was in Africa
the whole time.

56:21.880 --> 56:23.680
A technological marvel.

56:23.840 --> 56:26.240
All because it was built
on a mound

56:26.360 --> 56:28.400
of the most valuable metal
known to man.

56:28.560 --> 56:31.680
Isipho,  they call it.
The gift.

56:32.280 --> 56:33.400
Vibranium.

56:33.560 --> 56:35.720
Vibranium, yeah,
strongest metal on earth.

56:35.880 --> 56:37.120
It's not just a metal.

56:37.240 --> 56:39.760
They sew it
into their clothes.

56:39.920 --> 56:42.720
It powers their city,
their tech...

56:42.880 --> 56:44.160
their weapons.

56:44.800 --> 56:45.920
Weapons?

56:46.080 --> 56:47.080
Yeah.

56:47.160 --> 56:49.560
Makes my arm cannon
look like a leaf blower.

56:49.760 --> 56:51.040
That's a nice fairy tale,

56:51.120 --> 56:53.040
but Wakanda is
a third world country...

56:53.200 --> 56:55.680
and you stole
all their vibranium.

56:55.840 --> 56:57.120
I stole...

57:00.520 --> 57:01.760
All of it?

57:03.040 --> 57:05.640
I took a tiny piece of it.

57:05.800 --> 57:07.520
They have
a mountain full of it.

57:07.680 --> 57:09.880
They've been mining it
for thousands of years...

57:10.040 --> 57:12.320
and they still haven't
scratched the surface.

57:12.480 --> 57:14.480
I'm the only outsider
who's seen it

57:14.560 --> 57:16.160
and got out of there alive.

57:16.680 --> 57:18.000
If you don't believe me,

57:18.080 --> 57:21.280
you ask your friend
what his suit is made of.

57:21.600 --> 57:24.200
What his claws
are made of.

57:47.280 --> 57:48.880
Your father told
the UN...

57:49.040 --> 57:51.960
that Klaue stole
all the vibranium you had.

57:52.120 --> 57:53.680
But now he's telling me
you have more.

57:53.840 --> 57:55.280
And you believe the word

57:55.360 --> 57:57.880
of an arms dealer
strapped to a chair?

58:15.480 --> 58:17.760
Where is that?

58:18.680 --> 58:20.480
Back there.

58:32.320 --> 58:33.640
How much more
are you hiding?

58:35.720 --> 58:36.960
Something is happening
out back.

58:43.240 --> 58:44.240
Get down!

58:48.720 --> 58:50.160
Stand down!

58:53.680 --> 58:54.720
MAN 1: Cover!

58:54.840 --> 58:55.840
MAN 2: Grenade!

58:59.080 --> 59:01.720
I see you took your time,
didn't you?

59:21.680 --> 59:22.800
My King!

59:25.600 --> 59:26.720
My King.

59:27.320 --> 59:28.440
Nakia.

59:31.200 --> 59:33.000
He just jumped in front of me.

59:35.840 --> 59:37.480
I don't think
he'll make it here.

59:37.560 --> 59:38.960
It hit his spine.

59:41.600 --> 59:43.280
Give me a Kimoyo Bead.

59:47.360 --> 59:49.560
This will stabilize him
for now.

59:57.600 --> 59:59.080
Give him to us.

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:01.520
We can save him.

1:00:10.440 --> 1:00:12.960
OKOYE: Our mission
was to bring back Klaue.

1:00:14.080 --> 1:00:15.400
We failed.

1:00:15.680 --> 1:00:18.800
This man is a foreign
intelligence operative.

1:00:18.960 --> 1:00:21.480
How do we justify
bringing him
into our borders?

1:00:21.680 --> 1:00:22.920
He took a bullet for me.

1:00:23.080 --> 1:00:24.800
OKOYE: That was his choice.

1:00:25.520 --> 1:00:27.520
So now we are
just supposed to
let him die?

1:00:27.680 --> 1:00:29.520
Let us consider
that we heal him.

1:00:30.120 --> 1:00:32.920
It is his duty
to report back
to his country.

1:00:33.760 --> 1:00:35.760
And as king,
it is your duty
to protect ours.

1:00:35.920 --> 1:00:38.360
I'm well aware of
my duties, General.

1:00:38.960 --> 1:00:42.160
I cannot just
let him die...

1:00:42.960 --> 1:00:45.360
knowing we can save him.

1:00:45.560 --> 1:00:48.000
Where exactly
are we taking him?

1:00:55.560 --> 1:00:58.360
Great! Another broken
white boy for us to fix.

1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:00.480
This is going to be fun.

1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:08.840
He will live.

1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:14.480
W'Kabi is here.

1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:26.080
What's going on, brother?
Where is Klaue?

1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:28.200
He's not here.

1:01:32.080 --> 1:01:34.240
He slipped
through our hands.

1:01:35.840 --> 1:01:37.040
"Slipped"?

1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:42.800
For 30 years, your father was
in power and did nothing.

1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:45.160
With you, I thought
it'd be different.

1:01:46.200 --> 1:01:48.040
But it's more of the same.

1:02:07.840 --> 1:02:09.560
Let's get going, boss.

1:02:11.160 --> 1:02:12.960
You always sell
to the CIA?

1:02:13.120 --> 1:02:15.040
I sell
to the highest bidder.

1:02:15.200 --> 1:02:17.320
But don't you worry.
When I get back
to Joburg...

1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:18.800
and I lay low
for a bit,

1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:20.280
I'll make sure
both you guys get paid.

1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:22.160
Oh, I ain't worried
about the money, bro.

1:02:22.240 --> 1:02:23.240
I know you good for it.

1:02:23.400 --> 1:02:26.000
On our way back,
just drop us off in Wakanda.

1:02:26.080 --> 1:02:27.080
You don't want to
go there, boy.

1:02:27.160 --> 1:02:28.160
Yeah, I do.

1:02:31.120 --> 1:02:32.120
KLAUE: Drop it!

1:02:32.600 --> 1:02:34.760
Or your little
Bonnie and Clyde routine

1:02:34.840 --> 1:02:36.120
ends today.

1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:37.680
Put your gun down now!

1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:39.440
I'm sorry.

1:02:39.600 --> 1:02:41.840
Sorry, Erik.
It's gonna be okay.

1:03:10.440 --> 1:03:12.760
You really want to go
to Wakanda?

1:03:13.800 --> 1:03:15.240
They're savages.

1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:19.360
This is what they do
to people like us.

1:03:19.520 --> 1:03:20.680
KILLMONGER: I ain't worried
about no brand.

1:03:20.840 --> 1:03:22.320
Check these out.

1:03:23.640 --> 1:03:25.000
Each one is for a kill.

1:03:25.480 --> 1:03:28.160
You can scar yourself as much
as you'd like.

1:03:28.360 --> 1:03:31.160
To them,
you'll just be an outsider.

1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:33.600
You're crazy to think
that you can walk in there.

1:03:39.720 --> 1:03:43.440
Ah, to think I saw you
as some crazy American.

1:03:57.760 --> 1:03:59.040
T'CHALLA: Leave us!

1:04:09.960 --> 1:04:13.480
So your mission
did not go as planned.

1:04:14.560 --> 1:04:18.200
What happened
to my uncle N'Jobu?

1:04:18.960 --> 1:04:21.720
My father told me
he disappeared.

1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:24.280
There was a man today...

1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:29.160
wearing a ring
identical to this one.

1:04:30.720 --> 1:04:32.720
That is not possible.

1:04:33.200 --> 1:04:36.600
He helped Klaue escape from us
and he was wearing this ring!

1:04:36.760 --> 1:04:39.000
My grandfather's ring!

1:04:39.160 --> 1:04:40.720
Do not tell me
what is possible.

1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:41.840
Tell me the truth!

1:04:46.640 --> 1:04:48.120
Some truths...

1:04:51.080 --> 1:04:54.600
are too much to bear,
T'Challa.

1:04:55.600 --> 1:04:58.080
That is not your choice
to make.

1:04:58.960 --> 1:04:59.920
What happened to him?

1:05:00.040 --> 1:05:01.600
I promised the king
to say nothing.

1:05:01.760 --> 1:05:03.600
I am your king now!

1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:21.560
Your uncle took...

1:05:22.800 --> 1:05:26.720
a War Dog assignment
in America.

1:05:29.520 --> 1:05:30.720
Your father...

1:05:31.520 --> 1:05:33.240
placed me there...

1:05:34.080 --> 1:05:35.120
to observe...

1:05:36.680 --> 1:05:38.720
unbeknownst to him.

1:05:38.920 --> 1:05:41.800
Your uncle fell in love
with an American woman.

1:05:42.400 --> 1:05:43.640
They had a child.

1:05:45.080 --> 1:05:47.400
The hardships
he saw there...

1:05:48.800 --> 1:05:50.880
radicalized your uncle.

1:05:51.040 --> 1:05:53.240
I observed
for as long as I could.

1:05:54.440 --> 1:05:56.080
Their leaders
have been assassinated.

1:05:56.240 --> 1:05:58.680
Communities flooded
with drugs and weapons.

1:05:58.840 --> 1:06:01.200
They are overly policed
and incarcerated.

1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:03.440
All over the planet...

1:06:03.600 --> 1:06:04.880
our people suffer because

1:06:04.960 --> 1:06:06.960
they don't have the tools
to fight back.

1:06:07.960 --> 1:06:09.280
With vibranium weapons,

1:06:09.360 --> 1:06:10.920
they could overthrow
every country...

1:06:11.080 --> 1:06:12.880
and Wakanda could
rule them all

1:06:12.960 --> 1:06:14.280
the right way.

1:06:14.440 --> 1:06:17.960
He knew your father
would not support this.

1:06:18.840 --> 1:06:21.920
So, your uncle betrayed us.

1:06:22.080 --> 1:06:23.280
No!

1:06:23.440 --> 1:06:26.720
He helped Klaue
steal the vibranium.

1:06:28.280 --> 1:06:29.680
No, no, no.

1:06:29.880 --> 1:06:31.440
You will return home
at once...

1:06:31.600 --> 1:06:33.440
where you will face
the Council...

1:06:33.600 --> 1:06:36.560
and inform them
of your crimes.

1:06:36.760 --> 1:06:38.440
ZURI: He drew his weapon
on me.

1:06:38.640 --> 1:06:40.880
No!

1:06:55.960 --> 1:06:59.720
ZURI: Your father
killed his own brother...

1:06:59.880 --> 1:07:03.720
to save my life.

1:07:07.600 --> 1:07:10.800
Speak nothing of this.

1:07:15.080 --> 1:07:16.440
And the child?

1:07:20.280 --> 1:07:21.840
We left him.

1:07:30.240 --> 1:07:31.440
We had to...

1:07:32.560 --> 1:07:33.720
maintain...

1:07:35.320 --> 1:07:36.480
the lie.

1:08:01.960 --> 1:08:03.360
What is this?

1:08:03.920 --> 1:08:05.400
Just a little gift.

1:08:29.360 --> 1:08:30.520
Who are you?

1:09:19.840 --> 1:09:21.320
All right,
where am I?

1:09:21.880 --> 1:09:24.120
Don't scare me
like that, colonizer!

1:09:24.720 --> 1:09:26.440
What?
My name is Everett.

1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:29.760
Yes, I know.
Everett Ross...

1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:32.720
former air force pilot
and now CIA.

1:09:33.200 --> 1:09:34.240
Right.

1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:40.400
Okay, is this Wakanda?

1:09:40.560 --> 1:09:42.160
No, it's Kansas.

1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:47.040
How long ago was Korea?

1:09:47.200 --> 1:09:48.320
SHURI: Yesterday.

1:09:48.480 --> 1:09:49.480
I don't think so.

1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:51.800
Bullet wounds don't just
magically heal overnight.

1:09:51.920 --> 1:09:54.120
They do here.

1:09:54.280 --> 1:09:57.520
But not by magic,
by technology.

1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:05.200
Don't touch anything.
My brother will return soon.

1:10:28.920 --> 1:10:31.400
ROSS: These train things...

1:10:31.520 --> 1:10:33.760
that's magnetic levitation,
right?

1:10:33.920 --> 1:10:35.000
Obviously.

1:10:35.160 --> 1:10:39.400
Obviously, but I've never
seen it this efficient.

1:10:42.040 --> 1:10:43.200
The light panels,
what are they?

1:10:43.680 --> 1:10:45.880
Sonic stabilizers.
Sonic what?

1:10:46.240 --> 1:10:47.520
In its raw form...

1:10:47.720 --> 1:10:49.320
vibranium is too dangerous

1:10:49.400 --> 1:10:51.160
to be transported
at that speed...

1:10:51.320 --> 1:10:54.400
so I developed a way
to temporarily deactivate it.

1:10:55.560 --> 1:10:57.040
ROSS: There's vibranium
on those trains?

1:10:57.200 --> 1:10:59.440
There's vibranium
all around us.

1:11:01.160 --> 1:11:02.760
That's how I healed you.

1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:12.280
Where is T'Challa?

1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:14.440
His Kimoyo Beads
have been switched off.

1:11:14.600 --> 1:11:16.880
Well, we are not
joined at the hip, Okoye.

1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:18.320
A man showed up
at the border

1:11:18.400 --> 1:11:19.680
who claims
to have killed Klaue.

1:11:19.840 --> 1:11:20.880
What?

1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:23.480
W'Kabi is transporting him,
as we speak, to the palace.

1:11:23.640 --> 1:11:25.520
We need to find your brother!

1:11:25.680 --> 1:11:26.720
An outsider?

1:11:26.880 --> 1:11:28.480
No, a Wakandan.

1:11:28.680 --> 1:11:30.080
He's not a Wakandan.

1:11:32.720 --> 1:11:33.920
He's one of ours.

1:11:46.920 --> 1:11:48.960
He killed his
own brother...

1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:51.320
and left a child behind...

1:11:51.480 --> 1:11:52.720
with nothing.

1:11:54.680 --> 1:11:56.280
What kind of king...

1:11:58.200 --> 1:12:00.360
What kind of man
does that?

1:12:00.520 --> 1:12:02.720
No man is perfect.

1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:04.960
Not even your father.

1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:07.880
He didn't even give him
a proper burial.

1:12:09.760 --> 1:12:12.840
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us,
but my father...

1:12:14.240 --> 1:12:16.280
he may have created
something even worse.

1:12:16.720 --> 1:12:17.720
Hey.

1:12:19.560 --> 1:12:20.720
Look at me.

1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:27.840
You can't let your father's
mistakes define who you are.

1:12:29.480 --> 1:12:34.120
You get to decide
what kind of king
you are going to be.

1:12:40.160 --> 1:12:42.720
Brother, you need to
get here now!

1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:44.440
ROSS: Erik Stevens.

1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:47.120
Graduated Annapolis
age 19...

1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:49.240
MIT for grad school.

1:12:49.400 --> 1:12:51.600
Joined the SEALs and went
straight to Afghanistan...

1:12:51.760 --> 1:12:53.160
where he wrapped up
confirmed kills,

1:12:53.240 --> 1:12:54.320
like it was a video game.

1:12:54.800 --> 1:12:56.560
Started calling him
Killmonger.

1:12:56.720 --> 1:12:59.360
He joined a JSOC ghost unit.
Now these guys are serious.

1:12:59.560 --> 1:13:00.960
They will drop off
the grid...

1:13:01.120 --> 1:13:02.400
so they can
commit assassinations

1:13:02.480 --> 1:13:03.600
and take down governments.

1:13:04.440 --> 1:13:07.800
Did he reveal anything
about his identity?

1:13:08.120 --> 1:13:09.640
SHURI: He has
a War Dog tattoo...

1:13:10.320 --> 1:13:12.880
but we have no record of him.

1:13:19.560 --> 1:13:21.400
Is this man Wakandan or not?

1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:24.440
Tell us what is going on.

1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:44.960
Speak.

1:13:45.400 --> 1:13:46.400
Speak.

1:13:48.360 --> 1:13:50.600
I'm standing
in your house...

1:13:50.760 --> 1:13:52.160
serving justice to a man

1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:54.520
who stole your vibranium
and murdered your people.

1:13:55.360 --> 1:13:56.640
Justice your king
couldn't deliver.

1:14:02.120 --> 1:14:04.680
I don't care
that you brought Klaue.

1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:07.200
Only reason
I don't kill you
where you stand

1:14:07.280 --> 1:14:09.320
is because I know
who you are.

1:14:10.600 --> 1:14:12.280
Now, what do you want?

1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:15.600
I want the throne.

1:14:17.080 --> 1:14:18.280
My goodness.

1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:23.080
Y'all sittin' up here
comfortable.

1:14:23.720 --> 1:14:25.200
Must feel good.

1:14:25.920 --> 1:14:27.440
It's about
two billion people

1:14:27.520 --> 1:14:29.120
all over the world
that looks like us.

1:14:29.720 --> 1:14:31.680
But their lives
are a lot harder.

1:14:31.840 --> 1:14:34.160
Wakanda has the tools
to liberate 'em all.

1:14:34.320 --> 1:14:36.520
And what tools
are those?

1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:39.760
Vibranium.
Your weapons.

1:14:39.920 --> 1:14:43.520
Our weapons will not be used
to wage war on the world.

1:14:43.800 --> 1:14:47.440
It is not our way to be judge,
jury and executioner...

1:14:47.600 --> 1:14:49.440
for people
who are not our own.

1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:51.480
Not your own?

1:14:51.640 --> 1:14:54.120
But didn't life start
right here on this continent?

1:14:54.280 --> 1:14:55.720
So ain't all people
your people?

1:14:55.880 --> 1:14:59.520
I am not king of all people.
I am king of Wakanda.

1:15:00.400 --> 1:15:02.280
And it is my responsibility

1:15:02.360 --> 1:15:04.240
to make sure
our people are safe...

1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:06.640
and that vibranium
does not fall

1:15:06.720 --> 1:15:08.520
into the hands
of a person like you.

1:15:08.680 --> 1:15:09.680
Mmm...
RAMONDA: Son.

1:15:10.200 --> 1:15:12.560
We have entertained
this charlatan for too long.

1:15:12.640 --> 1:15:14.480
Reject his request.

1:15:14.640 --> 1:15:17.120
Oh, I ain't
requesting nothing.

1:15:17.320 --> 1:15:19.960
Ask who I am.
You're Erik Stevens.

1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:22.800
An American
black operative.

1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:24.640
A mercenary
nicknamed Killmonger.

1:15:24.720 --> 1:15:25.720
That's who you are.

1:15:25.920 --> 1:15:27.440
That's not my name,
Princess.

1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:29.200
Ask me, King.

1:15:29.360 --> 1:15:30.520
No.

1:15:31.640 --> 1:15:32.800
Ask me.

1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:36.520
Take him away.

1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:39.000
Who are you?

1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:43.520
I am N'Jadaka,
son of Prince N'Jobu.

1:15:44.640 --> 1:15:45.680
Son of N'Jobu?

1:15:45.840 --> 1:15:46.800
I found my daddy

1:15:46.880 --> 1:15:47.920
with Panther claws
in his chest!

1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:50.080
You ain't the son of a king.
You a son of a murderer.

1:15:50.240 --> 1:15:51.400
You're lying!

1:15:51.560 --> 1:15:53.520
Lies!
I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.

1:15:55.800 --> 1:15:57.080
RIVER TRIBE ELDER:
What?

1:15:59.560 --> 1:16:00.720
The descendent
of N'Jobu.

1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:02.440
Hey, Auntie.

1:16:05.920 --> 1:16:07.800
I'm exercising
my blood right

1:16:07.920 --> 1:16:09.560
to challenge
for the mantles of king...

1:16:09.720 --> 1:16:11.320
and Black Panther.

1:16:16.040 --> 1:16:17.400
Do not do this, T'Challa.

1:16:17.560 --> 1:16:19.760
BORDER TRIBE ELDER:
As the son of Prince N'Jobu,

1:16:19.840 --> 1:16:21.440
he is within his rights.

1:16:21.600 --> 1:16:22.960
He has no rights here!

1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:25.200
The challenge
will take weeks
to prepare.

1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:28.600
Weeks? I don't need weeks.

1:16:28.760 --> 1:16:31.000
The whole country ain't gotta
be there. I just need him.

1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:33.360
And somebody to get me
outta these chains.

1:16:37.400 --> 1:16:40.280
T'Challa,
what do you know of this?

1:16:41.560 --> 1:16:44.000
I accept your challenge.

1:17:02.120 --> 1:17:03.480
SHURI: He'll never
beat T'Challa.

1:17:03.680 --> 1:17:05.800
He should've just come
to the first challenge

1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:07.640
and gotten it over with.

1:17:13.640 --> 1:17:16.000
ZURI: The king
will now have the strength

1:17:16.080 --> 1:17:18.840
of the Black Panther
stripped away.

1:17:50.840 --> 1:17:52.120
Where is Agent Ross?

1:17:52.280 --> 1:17:55.040
I locked him in the office.
He's not going anywhere.

1:17:59.520 --> 1:18:01.440
This is your last chance.

1:18:03.440 --> 1:18:05.280
Throw down your weapons,

1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:08.000
and we can handle this
another way.

1:18:15.320 --> 1:18:19.280
I lived my entire life
waitin' for this moment.

1:18:19.440 --> 1:18:23.160
I trained,
I lied, I killed...

1:18:23.320 --> 1:18:25.040
just to get here.

1:18:25.840 --> 1:18:29.440
I killed in America,
Afghanistan...

1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:32.360
Iraq.

1:18:33.960 --> 1:18:35.840
I took life from
my own brothers and sisters

1:18:35.920 --> 1:18:37.080
right here on this continent.

1:18:39.800 --> 1:18:41.200
And all this death...

1:18:42.440 --> 1:18:44.800
just so I could kill you.

1:18:52.400 --> 1:18:55.600
Let the challenge begin.

1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:35.240
Yield!

1:19:57.000 --> 1:19:58.320
Snap out of it, T'Challa!

1:20:18.680 --> 1:20:19.680
Come on, get up.

1:20:21.040 --> 1:20:22.040
Come here.

1:20:25.760 --> 1:20:27.040
This is for my father.

1:20:28.480 --> 1:20:29.800
ZURI: Erik!

1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:32.200
Zuri, no.
Stop!

1:20:32.560 --> 1:20:33.800
Zuri!
Zuri, don't!

1:20:33.960 --> 1:20:35.960
I am the cause of
your father's death.

1:20:36.120 --> 1:20:37.360
Not him.

1:20:37.920 --> 1:20:39.080
Take me.

1:20:40.440 --> 1:20:42.000
I'll take you both,
Uncle James.

1:20:42.920 --> 1:20:44.520
No!

1:20:44.600 --> 1:20:47.040
No! No!

1:20:48.720 --> 1:20:49.760
Zuri, no!

1:20:51.120 --> 1:20:52.080
No!

1:20:52.480 --> 1:20:55.920
No! No! Zuri! Zuri!

1:20:56.440 --> 1:20:58.240
No! No!

1:21:01.440 --> 1:21:03.720
Is this your king? Huh?

1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:07.280
Is this your king?

1:21:13.640 --> 1:21:15.120
The Black Panther,

1:21:15.200 --> 1:21:17.000
who's supposed to
lead you into the future?

1:21:17.160 --> 1:21:18.680
Come on, Brother!

1:21:18.840 --> 1:21:20.160
Is there nothing
that can be done?

1:21:21.680 --> 1:21:23.680
Him?

1:21:24.760 --> 1:21:25.800
He's supposed to protect you?

1:21:38.360 --> 1:21:39.760
No.
No!

1:21:47.280 --> 1:21:49.200
No!

1:21:52.360 --> 1:21:54.800
Nah. I'm your king.

1:21:54.960 --> 1:21:56.640
No! No!
We have to go now!

1:21:56.800 --> 1:21:58.880
Queen Mother,
let's go!

1:22:34.720 --> 1:22:36.400
The Queen Mother and Shuri,
they are safe?

1:22:36.560 --> 1:22:38.240
Yes.

1:22:38.320 --> 1:22:39.720
Thank you.

1:22:39.880 --> 1:22:42.240
We should get
to them immediately.

1:22:42.680 --> 1:22:44.280
I cannot.

1:22:44.480 --> 1:22:45.080
What?

1:22:45.240 --> 1:22:46.680
Though my heart
is with you.

1:22:48.080 --> 1:22:50.400
We cannot turn over
our nation to a man

1:22:50.480 --> 1:22:52.160
who showed up here
only hours ago.

1:22:52.280 --> 1:22:53.280
He is of royal blood.

1:22:53.400 --> 1:22:55.680
He killed T'Challa!
In ritual combat.

1:22:55.840 --> 1:22:57.680
Does that really matter?

1:23:00.360 --> 1:23:03.240
You are the greatest warrior
Wakanda has.

1:23:03.640 --> 1:23:07.400
Help me overthrow him
before he becomes
too strong.

1:23:07.560 --> 1:23:08.680
Overthrow?

1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:10.720
Nakia!

1:23:12.200 --> 1:23:14.960
I'm not a spy who can come
and go as they so choose!

1:23:16.720 --> 1:23:21.160
I am loyal to that throne,
no matter who sits upon it.

1:23:21.800 --> 1:23:23.520
What are you loyal to?

1:23:26.960 --> 1:23:28.440
I loved him.

1:23:29.840 --> 1:23:32.120
I loved my country, too.

1:23:32.320 --> 1:23:34.360
Then you serve your country.

1:23:34.520 --> 1:23:37.680
No. I save my country.

1:23:46.680 --> 1:23:47.720
What's wrong?

1:23:48.080 --> 1:23:49.480
The king is dead.

1:23:50.880 --> 1:23:52.800
Come with me,
unless you want to join him.

1:24:12.800 --> 1:24:14.120
First Baba.

1:24:15.640 --> 1:24:17.240
And now my brother.

1:24:20.080 --> 1:24:22.880
Mama, we didn't
even get to bury him.

1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:33.120
It's me.
Nakia. Who is this man?

1:24:33.280 --> 1:24:35.120
He's a friend of T'Challa's.
He saved my life.

1:24:36.280 --> 1:24:37.320
Where's Okoye?

1:24:37.400 --> 1:24:38.480
Okoye is not coming.

1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:41.400
She and the Dora Milaje
will serve the new king.

1:24:47.320 --> 1:24:48.680
Wait here.

1:24:52.320 --> 1:24:55.080
What has happened
to our Wakanda?

1:24:57.480 --> 1:24:59.600
SHAMAN:
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...

1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:02.720
to give you the powers
of the Black Panther...

1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:05.680
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.

1:26:40.840 --> 1:26:43.600
N'JOBU: What did I tell you
about going into my things?

1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:45.000
Hmm?

1:26:50.920 --> 1:26:53.200
What did you find?

1:26:54.120 --> 1:26:55.560
Your home.

1:26:57.880 --> 1:27:00.920
I gave you a key hoping that
you might see it someday.

1:27:02.840 --> 1:27:04.960
Yes. The sunsets there

1:27:05.040 --> 1:27:06.840
are the most beautiful
in the world.

1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:11.240
But I fear you still may not
be welcome.

1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:15.000
Why?

1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:18.800
They will say you are lost.

1:27:19.400 --> 1:27:21.080
But I'm right here.

1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:27.840
No tears for me?

1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:33.360
Everybody dies.

1:27:35.440 --> 1:27:37.160
It's just life around here.

1:27:41.600 --> 1:27:43.520
Well, look at what
I have done.

1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:47.600
I should've taken
you back long ago.

1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:52.840
Instead, we are both
abandoned here.

1:27:57.960 --> 1:28:00.520
Well, maybe your home
is the one that's lost.

1:28:02.520 --> 1:28:04.960
That's why they can't find us.

1:28:11.960 --> 1:28:14.360
Breathe! Breathe,
My King, breathe.

1:28:14.560 --> 1:28:16.920
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

1:28:33.760 --> 1:28:35.520
The Heart-Shaped Herb
did that?

1:28:38.560 --> 1:28:39.600
This all of it?

1:28:39.760 --> 1:28:41.640
Yes. So when it comes time
for another king,

1:28:41.720 --> 1:28:42.880
we will be ready.

1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:44.800
Another king?

1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:49.040
Yeah, go ahead
and burn all that.

1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:51.800
My King, we cannot do that.
It is our tradition...

1:28:55.440 --> 1:28:58.400
When I tell you to do
something, I mean that shit.

1:29:02.320 --> 1:29:03.880
Burn it all!

1:29:53.040 --> 1:29:54.560
You know, where I'm from...

1:29:55.520 --> 1:29:57.600
when black folks
started revolutions,

1:29:57.720 --> 1:29:59.480
they never had
the firepower...

1:29:59.600 --> 1:30:01.680
or the resources
to fight their oppressors.

1:30:02.320 --> 1:30:03.960
Where was Wakanda?

1:30:06.520 --> 1:30:07.520
Hmm?

1:30:10.080 --> 1:30:11.800
Yeah, all that ends today.

1:30:11.960 --> 1:30:15.080
We got spies embedded
in every nation on Earth.

1:30:15.240 --> 1:30:16.960
Already in place.

1:30:17.120 --> 1:30:18.480
I know how colonizers think.

1:30:18.640 --> 1:30:21.160
So we're gonna use their own
strategy against 'em.

1:30:22.160 --> 1:30:25.040
We're gonna send vibranium
weapons out to our War Dogs.

1:30:25.200 --> 1:30:27.920
They'll arm oppressed people
all over the world...

1:30:28.080 --> 1:30:30.520
so they can finally rise up
and kill those in power.

1:30:30.680 --> 1:30:32.360
And their children.

1:30:32.440 --> 1:30:34.240
And anyone else
who takes their side.

1:30:34.400 --> 1:30:36.840
It's time they know
the truth about us!

1:30:37.040 --> 1:30:38.640
We're warriors!

1:30:38.800 --> 1:30:41.920
The world's gonna start over,
and this time, we're on top.

1:30:43.480 --> 1:30:46.880
The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.

1:30:47.600 --> 1:30:50.280
OKOYE: Wakanda has survived
for so long...

1:30:50.440 --> 1:30:53.760
by fighting when only
absolutely necessary.

1:30:53.920 --> 1:30:56.560
Wakanda survived
in the past this way, yes.

1:30:58.080 --> 1:31:00.280
But the world is changing,
General.

1:31:01.040 --> 1:31:04.480
Elders,
it is getting smaller.

1:31:04.640 --> 1:31:06.520
The outside world
is catching up...

1:31:06.680 --> 1:31:08.680
and soon it will be
the conquerors

1:31:08.760 --> 1:31:10.840
or the conquered.

1:31:12.800 --> 1:31:14.480
I'd rather be the former.

1:31:16.680 --> 1:31:19.520
You heard your orders.
Let's get to it.

1:31:21.080 --> 1:31:22.280
ROSS: So where are we
going again?

1:31:22.440 --> 1:31:24.040
NAKIA: We're taking
the Heart-Shaped Herb

1:31:24.160 --> 1:31:25.120
to Jabariland.

1:31:25.280 --> 1:31:26.920
Heart-Shaped Herb?
What is that?

1:31:27.080 --> 1:31:29.480
It gives whoever takes it
heightened abilities.

1:31:29.640 --> 1:31:32.240
It's what made T'Challa
so strong.

1:31:32.800 --> 1:31:33.840
Nakia.

1:31:38.200 --> 1:31:40.080
I don't like this.

1:31:40.240 --> 1:31:42.000
The Herb belongs to us.

1:31:42.160 --> 1:31:45.360
We may be creating
a bigger monster
with M'Baku.

1:31:51.480 --> 1:31:55.240
Nakia, you should
take it yourself.

1:31:55.800 --> 1:31:59.240
I am a spy with no army.

1:32:00.600 --> 1:32:02.360
I wouldn't stand a chance.

1:32:04.120 --> 1:32:05.600
We'll go.

1:32:12.240 --> 1:32:13.520
Oh, boy.

1:32:18.840 --> 1:32:20.160
ROSS: Oh, shit.

1:32:21.280 --> 1:32:23.160
Look down. Stay calm.

1:32:23.320 --> 1:32:24.320
Shuri.

1:32:25.640 --> 1:32:27.040
Look down.

1:33:02.360 --> 1:33:03.680
My son...

1:33:05.680 --> 1:33:08.320
was murdered
in ritual combat.

1:33:08.800 --> 1:33:10.960
Were the odds fair?
Yes, but...

1:33:11.120 --> 1:33:12.720
So it was less a murder
than a defeat.

1:33:12.880 --> 1:33:14.760
Do not rub our noses in it!
Silence!

1:33:15.920 --> 1:33:18.520
I make
the pronouncements here, girl.

1:33:18.680 --> 1:33:21.360
Look, uh, Your Highness,
the new king is a U.S...

1:33:23.400 --> 1:33:25.360
The new king...

1:33:33.160 --> 1:33:35.360
M'BAKU: You cannot talk!

1:33:35.520 --> 1:33:36.920
One more word,

1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:39.240
and I will feed you
to my children.

1:33:43.400 --> 1:33:45.640
I'm kidding.
We are vegetarians.

1:33:52.920 --> 1:33:56.120
NAKIA: Great Gorilla M'Baku...

1:33:58.640 --> 1:34:01.920
this is why we are here.

1:34:02.720 --> 1:34:04.880
To offer this to you.

1:34:05.680 --> 1:34:08.080
An outsider
sits on our throne.

1:34:08.240 --> 1:34:10.040
Only you can
help us stop him.

1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:28.920
Come with me.

1:34:45.280 --> 1:34:47.320
Impossible!

1:34:53.200 --> 1:34:54.240
Is he breathing?

1:34:54.400 --> 1:34:57.160
He's in a coma.
Barely clinging to life.

1:34:57.520 --> 1:34:59.200
One of our fishermen found him

1:34:59.280 --> 1:35:00.920
at the edge
of the river border.

1:35:01.080 --> 1:35:02.360
He brought him to me.

1:35:02.520 --> 1:35:04.280
Why do you have him
in the snow?

1:35:04.440 --> 1:35:05.600
It is the only thing
keeping him

1:35:05.720 --> 1:35:06.760
from joining
the ancestors.

1:35:06.920 --> 1:35:09.440
We need to get him to my lab.
I can heal him there.

1:35:09.640 --> 1:35:11.160
Take him.
He'll be dead in seconds.

1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:14.520
Nakia, the Herb.

1:35:31.440 --> 1:35:33.400
I call upon
the ancestors.

1:35:33.800 --> 1:35:35.760
I call upon Bast.

1:35:36.280 --> 1:35:39.240
I am here
with my son, T'Challa.

1:35:40.280 --> 1:35:41.760
Heal him.

1:35:53.680 --> 1:35:56.640
We must bury him.
Cover him. Cover him!

1:35:56.800 --> 1:35:58.040
Okay.

1:36:10.160 --> 1:36:11.480
Praise the ancestors.

1:36:11.640 --> 1:36:12.640
Praise the ancestors.

1:36:13.760 --> 1:36:15.240
Praise the ancestors.

1:36:16.280 --> 1:36:17.680
Praise the ancestors.

1:36:18.480 --> 1:36:20.200
Wake up, T'Challa.

1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:22.800
Wake up.

1:36:25.280 --> 1:36:26.640
My son.

1:36:33.040 --> 1:36:35.920
The time has come
for you to come home...

1:36:36.080 --> 1:36:38.520
and be reunited with me.

1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:50.880
Why?

1:36:53.040 --> 1:36:56.120
Why didn't you
bring the boy home?

1:36:57.840 --> 1:36:59.360
Why, Baba?

1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:02.400
He...

1:37:03.360 --> 1:37:06.640
He was the truth
I chose to omit.

1:37:07.800 --> 1:37:10.400
You were wrong to abandon him.

1:37:10.560 --> 1:37:12.440
I chose my people.

1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:15.840
I chose Wakanda.

1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:17.880
Our future depended...

1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:19.600
You were wrong!

1:37:19.760 --> 1:37:22.000
All of you were wrong!

1:37:23.040 --> 1:37:25.960
To turn your backs
on the rest of the world!

1:37:28.320 --> 1:37:30.240
We let the fear
of our discovery

1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:32.880
stop us from doing
what is right!

1:37:33.960 --> 1:37:35.320
No more!

1:37:39.120 --> 1:37:42.880
I cannot stay here with you.

1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:48.920
I cannot rest
while he sits on the throne.

1:37:49.400 --> 1:37:52.440
He is a monster
of our own making.

1:37:54.120 --> 1:37:57.440
I must take the mantle back.
I must!

1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:02.160
I must right these wrongs.

1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:14.680
Do you have a blanket?

1:38:17.480 --> 1:38:19.280
NAKIA: Killmonger
has the full support

1:38:19.360 --> 1:38:20.520
of our military.

1:38:22.680 --> 1:38:24.880
And he burned the garden
of the Heart-Shaped Herb.

1:38:25.960 --> 1:38:27.080
ROSS: Of course he did.

1:38:27.160 --> 1:38:28.960
That's what he was
trained to do.

1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:30.760
His unit used to work
with the CIA

1:38:30.840 --> 1:38:32.640
to destabilize
foreign countries.

1:38:32.840 --> 1:38:34.920
They would always strike
at transitions of power...

1:38:35.080 --> 1:38:37.240
like an election year,
or the death of a monarch.

1:38:37.400 --> 1:38:39.800
You get control of government,
the military...

1:38:39.960 --> 1:38:42.040
Our resources.
ROSS: Right.

1:38:43.160 --> 1:38:44.160
The Great Mound.

1:38:44.320 --> 1:38:46.000
Our vibranium,
all of my designs.

1:38:46.160 --> 1:38:48.840
He will send our weapons
all over the world.

1:38:52.160 --> 1:38:54.480
You must get them
out of Wakanda safely.

1:38:54.640 --> 1:38:55.640
What?
What about you?

1:38:56.560 --> 1:38:58.520
The challenge
will have to continue.

1:38:58.680 --> 1:39:02.000
T'Challa, we will not
leave Wakanda.

1:39:02.120 --> 1:39:04.160
It is my duty
to keep you safe.

1:39:04.320 --> 1:39:06.800
If he gets control
of our technology,

1:39:06.920 --> 1:39:08.240
nowhere will be safe.

1:39:28.880 --> 1:39:30.800
The Black Panther lives.

1:39:31.760 --> 1:39:33.840
And when he fights
for the fate of Wakanda...

1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:36.560
I will be right there
beside him.

1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:38.880
As will I.

1:39:39.360 --> 1:39:40.600
ROSS: I'm in, too.

1:39:42.360 --> 1:39:44.400
What? You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

1:39:47.720 --> 1:39:49.160
Are you done?

1:39:50.320 --> 1:39:52.360
Are you done?

1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:57.080
Could you give me
and Lord M'Baku a moment?

1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:06.720
Thank you.

1:40:07.360 --> 1:40:09.640
I owed you a great debt.

1:40:10.440 --> 1:40:12.000
A life for a life.

1:40:12.160 --> 1:40:13.720
Consider it paid.

1:40:14.400 --> 1:40:16.600
Please allow my mother
to stay here.

1:40:17.400 --> 1:40:20.320
No harm will come to her.
I give you my word.

1:40:21.480 --> 1:40:24.160
You know, I could use
an army as well.

1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:28.240
But no.

1:40:29.960 --> 1:40:32.560
I will give no Jabari lives
towards your cause.

1:40:32.720 --> 1:40:34.400
It is our cause.

1:40:34.880 --> 1:40:37.320
It is for all of us.
Oh, us?

1:40:37.480 --> 1:40:39.760
Us? You are the first king
to come here in centuries...

1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:43.880
and now you speak of "us"?

1:40:45.160 --> 1:40:47.840
I cannot speak for past kings.

1:40:48.480 --> 1:40:51.360
But an enemy sits
on the throne right now.

1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:54.400
We both know the power
of vibranium.

1:40:55.040 --> 1:40:57.120
If Killmonger
gains control of it,

1:40:57.240 --> 1:40:59.200
who do you think
he will come for next?

1:41:05.880 --> 1:41:10.160
We will not help you.

1:41:38.800 --> 1:41:39.960
W'KABI:
Everything is on schedule.

1:41:40.160 --> 1:41:41.320
Have the spies
been alerted?

1:41:41.480 --> 1:41:43.600
Yes. Some resistance
to our new mission.

1:41:43.960 --> 1:41:45.480
But the War Dogs
in London,

1:41:45.560 --> 1:41:47.360
New York and Hong Kong
are standing by.

1:41:49.040 --> 1:41:50.600
We'll strike there first.

1:41:50.760 --> 1:41:52.560
The others'll come around.

1:41:52.720 --> 1:41:54.160
Look at this.

1:41:54.320 --> 1:41:55.400
A handheld sonic cannon,

1:41:55.480 --> 1:41:56.880
powerful enough
to stop a tank...

1:41:57.040 --> 1:41:58.640
untraceable by
metal detectors.

1:41:58.840 --> 1:42:00.880
And we got thousands of them.

1:42:03.040 --> 1:42:06.160
The world's gonna find out
exactly who we are.

1:42:37.680 --> 1:42:38.920
He lives.

1:42:42.960 --> 1:42:44.880
N'Jadaka!

1:42:46.080 --> 1:42:47.320
Wassup?

1:42:47.520 --> 1:42:49.240
I never yielded!

1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:53.720
And as you can see,
I am not dead!

1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:56.320
All that challenge shit
is over with!

1:42:56.440 --> 1:42:57.560
I'm the king now!

1:42:57.720 --> 1:42:59.920
Get those planes in the air!
Carry out the mission!

1:43:08.400 --> 1:43:10.000
Shuri, now.
SHURI:  Copy that.

1:43:13.320 --> 1:43:16.040
SHURI: Go, go, go!
Come on, Ross!

1:43:16.200 --> 1:43:18.640
W'Kabi, man,
kill this clown.

1:43:19.840 --> 1:43:22.920
W'Kabi, the challenge
is not complete.

1:43:26.960 --> 1:43:28.120
What will we do?

1:43:29.520 --> 1:43:30.640
Border Tribe!

1:43:44.680 --> 1:43:45.680
You!

1:43:45.840 --> 1:43:48.200
Your heart
is so full of hatred...

1:43:48.360 --> 1:43:50.200
you are not fit
to be a king!

1:43:54.480 --> 1:43:55.560
Come on!

1:43:55.640 --> 1:43:57.200
Ayo, the king!

1:44:12.480 --> 1:44:13.520
Shields!

1:44:44.160 --> 1:44:45.160
Ah!

1:44:48.640 --> 1:44:49.960
W'Kabi, stop this!

1:44:51.200 --> 1:44:52.720
Stop this now!

1:44:56.880 --> 1:44:57.880
No!

1:45:26.200 --> 1:45:28.720
Nakia and I will get control
of the Royal Talon  with this.

1:45:28.880 --> 1:45:30.320
So what do I do?

1:45:30.480 --> 1:45:31.600
You'll have to fly it.

1:45:32.440 --> 1:45:34.360
What?
You were a great pilot.

1:45:34.560 --> 1:45:36.600
Don't worry,
I'll guide you through it.

1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:38.880
It's just like riding
a hoverbike.

1:45:39.600 --> 1:45:41.240
What? You guys
have hoverbikes?

1:45:41.440 --> 1:45:43.200
Hey, Nakia, take that.

1:45:43.400 --> 1:45:46.120
I'm not a Dora.
Just put it on, it's armor!

1:45:47.640 --> 1:45:48.680
Come!

1:45:51.120 --> 1:45:52.280
Good luck, Agent Ross!

1:45:52.440 --> 1:45:53.800
Yeah, I don't know
what I'm doing with this.

1:45:53.880 --> 1:45:55.280
NAKIA: We're counting on you.

1:46:07.920 --> 1:46:09.320
Wakanda forever.

1:46:17.560 --> 1:46:18.560
Come on!

1:46:29.040 --> 1:46:30.160
NAKIA: Go, go!

1:46:36.080 --> 1:46:38.960
AUTOMATED VOICE: Remote
piloting system activated.

1:46:39.920 --> 1:46:40.960
My God.

1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:44.160
SHURI: I made it American
style for you. Get in.

1:46:44.320 --> 1:46:45.880
All right.

1:46:52.080 --> 1:46:53.080
Yes!

1:46:55.160 --> 1:46:57.880
Go! We can't let those weapons
get beyond Wakanda.

1:46:59.880 --> 1:47:00.920
All right, I'm on it.

1:47:18.080 --> 1:47:19.320
Lock!

1:47:20.480 --> 1:47:21.680
Get him down!

1:47:21.920 --> 1:47:23.440
Get the necklace!

1:47:23.920 --> 1:47:25.480
Get the necklace!

1:47:32.160 --> 1:47:34.280
Wakanda forever!

1:47:42.080 --> 1:47:44.320
Okay, Shuri. I got 'em.
What do I do?

1:47:44.520 --> 1:47:45.880
Shoot them down, genius!

1:47:46.040 --> 1:47:47.040
All right.

1:47:48.680 --> 1:47:49.720
Here goes nothing.

1:47:56.960 --> 1:47:58.080
All right, got them.

1:48:02.440 --> 1:48:03.640
Oh, shit.

1:48:04.600 --> 1:48:06.360
Shit, shit, shit.

1:48:26.680 --> 1:48:27.760
KILLMONGER: Nice!

1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:04.040
BLACK PANTHER: Shuri!

1:49:08.320 --> 1:49:09.720
What's up, Princess?

1:49:09.880 --> 1:49:11.960
You'll never be a true king.

1:49:14.920 --> 1:49:15.920
Brother!

1:49:48.080 --> 1:49:49.360
Shuri.

1:49:49.800 --> 1:49:50.800
Brother!

1:49:51.680 --> 1:49:53.360
Turn on the train
on the bottom track.

1:49:53.520 --> 1:49:55.560
SHURI: The stabilizers
will deactivate your suit!

1:49:55.720 --> 1:49:57.040
You won't have protection!

1:49:57.200 --> 1:49:58.560
Neither will he.

1:49:58.720 --> 1:50:00.080
Okay!

1:50:24.120 --> 1:50:26.400
I don't need a suit
to kill you.

1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:27.800
Your reign is over!

1:50:27.960 --> 1:50:29.560
You sat up here,
safe and protected.

1:50:29.720 --> 1:50:31.120
T'CHALLA: You want to
see us become

1:50:31.200 --> 1:50:33.120
just like the people
you hate so much.

1:50:33.280 --> 1:50:35.040
Divide and conquer the land
as they did!

1:50:35.200 --> 1:50:37.640
Nah, I learn from my enemies.
Beat them at they own game.

1:50:37.800 --> 1:50:39.040
You have become them!

1:50:39.360 --> 1:50:41.720
You will destroy the world,
Wakanda included!

1:50:41.880 --> 1:50:43.640
The world took
everything away from me!

1:50:43.800 --> 1:50:45.320
Everything I ever loved!

1:50:45.480 --> 1:50:46.920
But I'mma make sure
we're even.

1:50:47.120 --> 1:50:48.240
I'mma track down
anyone who would

1:50:48.320 --> 1:50:49.800
even think
about being loyal to you!

1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:51.280
And I'm gonna put
they ass in the dirt

1:50:51.360 --> 1:50:52.440
right next to Zuri!

1:50:54.520 --> 1:50:56.040
Nakia!

1:50:59.160 --> 1:51:00.960
Are you all right?
I'm okay. You?

1:51:01.120 --> 1:51:02.880
Yes.
Let's go.

1:51:10.040 --> 1:51:12.320
Shuri, I've lost one of them,
but two are on my tail.

1:51:14.760 --> 1:51:15.960
Shit. What the hell was that?

1:51:16.120 --> 1:51:17.480
AUTOMATED VOICE:
The lab is under attack.

1:51:17.560 --> 1:51:18.600
What? Where?

1:51:18.680 --> 1:51:20.600
Deactivating hologram.

1:51:24.640 --> 1:51:27.480
SHURI: Ross, you have to
get out of there, now!

1:51:28.080 --> 1:51:29.440
How long have I got?

1:51:30.160 --> 1:51:33.160
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Glass integrity is at 50%.

1:51:33.960 --> 1:51:35.000
Put me back in.

1:51:35.160 --> 1:51:36.880
SHURI: Ross! Ross!

1:51:55.800 --> 1:51:57.280
Surrender now!

1:51:57.760 --> 1:52:00.640
You have three seconds
to lay down your weapon!

1:52:00.800 --> 1:52:01.920
One!

1:52:02.040 --> 1:52:03.040
Two!

1:52:13.120 --> 1:52:17.320
Witness the might
of the Jabari firsthand!

1:52:58.400 --> 1:53:00.720
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Glass integrity is at 15%.

1:53:09.600 --> 1:53:11.600
Critical weapons failure.
Shit!

1:53:16.840 --> 1:53:18.480
Hey, Shuri!
The last cargo ship

1:53:18.560 --> 1:53:19.800
is almost at the border...

1:53:19.960 --> 1:53:21.120
but they got me trapped
with some kind of cables.

1:53:21.280 --> 1:53:22.600
Make an X with your arms!

1:53:23.400 --> 1:53:25.600
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Sonic Overload initiated.

1:53:26.400 --> 1:53:27.600
Now break it!

1:53:36.480 --> 1:53:38.440
AUTOMATED VOICE:
System rebooting in five...

1:53:38.880 --> 1:53:40.960
four, three...

1:53:41.120 --> 1:53:42.720
two, one.

1:53:43.320 --> 1:53:44.440
System rebooted.

1:53:56.760 --> 1:53:58.120
Yes! We did it!

1:53:58.280 --> 1:53:59.840
SHURI: Great!
Now get out of there!

1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:12.320
Charge!

1:54:32.080 --> 1:54:34.400
Drop your weapon!

1:54:35.960 --> 1:54:38.120
Would you kill me, my love?

1:54:38.280 --> 1:54:39.800
For Wakanda?

1:54:43.080 --> 1:54:44.800
Without question!

1:55:28.800 --> 1:55:30.360
This is it for you, Cousin.

1:55:56.040 --> 1:55:57.600
Hell of a move!

1:56:18.800 --> 1:56:20.400
My pop said Wakanda was

1:56:20.480 --> 1:56:22.080
the most beautiful thing
he ever seen.

1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:28.240
He promised he was gonna
show it to me one day.

1:56:29.920 --> 1:56:31.480
You believe that?

1:56:32.360 --> 1:56:33.480
Kid from Oakland,

1:56:33.560 --> 1:56:35.440
running around
believing in fairy tales.

1:57:23.840 --> 1:57:25.760
It's beautiful.

1:57:39.960 --> 1:57:42.400
Maybe we can still heal you.

1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:46.000
Why?

1:57:47.720 --> 1:57:49.960
So you can just lock me up?

1:57:53.200 --> 1:57:54.520
Nah.

1:57:56.720 --> 1:57:58.400
Just bury me in the ocean...

1:57:58.560 --> 1:58:01.120
with my ancestors
that jumped from the ships.

1:58:01.960 --> 1:58:05.320
'Cause they knew
death was better
than bondage.

1:59:29.880 --> 1:59:30.880
Thank you.

1:59:32.880 --> 1:59:34.480
You saved me.

1:59:35.400 --> 1:59:37.520
You saved my family.

1:59:39.760 --> 1:59:41.200
Our nation.

1:59:41.360 --> 1:59:43.680
There's nothing
to thank me for.

1:59:43.840 --> 1:59:45.400
It is our duty to...

1:59:49.040 --> 1:59:51.640
It was my duty to fight
for what I love.

1:59:52.720 --> 1:59:53.680
I should've...

2:00:00.400 --> 2:00:02.600
You can't blame me,
I almost died.

2:00:06.280 --> 2:00:07.520
Stay.

2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:11.240
I think I know a way

2:00:11.320 --> 2:00:13.600
you can still fulfill
your calling.

2:00:14.760 --> 2:00:16.160
Please stay.

2:00:49.280 --> 2:00:51.040
KID 1: Oh, he moves it!
He moves it!

2:00:51.200 --> 2:00:52.880
KID 2: Who man is that?
KID 3: Bucket!

2:00:53.040 --> 2:00:54.040
KID 2: Easy.

2:00:57.040 --> 2:00:58.400
When you said
you would take me

2:00:58.480 --> 2:01:00.400
to California
for the first time...

2:01:00.560 --> 2:01:02.520
I thought
you meant Coachella...

2:01:02.720 --> 2:01:04.160
or Disneyland.

2:01:04.840 --> 2:01:06.280
Why here?

2:01:09.400 --> 2:01:12.840
This is where our father
killed our uncle.

2:01:18.040 --> 2:01:19.760
They're tearing it down.

2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:21.880
Good.

2:01:22.040 --> 2:01:24.040
They are not tearing it down.

2:01:25.160 --> 2:01:26.800
I bought this building.

2:01:28.840 --> 2:01:30.760
And that building.

2:01:31.600 --> 2:01:33.320
And that one over there.

2:01:34.560 --> 2:01:35.840
This will be the first

2:01:35.920 --> 2:01:38.240
Wakandan International
Outreach Center.

2:01:39.520 --> 2:01:42.160
Nakia will oversee
the social outreach.

2:01:42.920 --> 2:01:44.160
And you will spearhead

2:01:44.240 --> 2:01:46.480
the science
and information exchange.

2:01:47.200 --> 2:01:49.120
You're kidding.

2:01:49.520 --> 2:01:50.800
Eh?

2:02:00.040 --> 2:02:01.080
Oh...

2:02:01.160 --> 2:02:04.080
Hey, yo. Man,
what the hell is that?

2:02:04.240 --> 2:02:05.960
KID 2: That's like
a Bugatti spaceship!

2:02:06.120 --> 2:02:08.720
Bro, it came out of nowhere.
Did y'all see that?

2:02:11.840 --> 2:02:13.000
What?

2:02:14.840 --> 2:02:15.840
KID 2: Check it out, bro.

2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:17.360
We can take this back
to the house.

2:02:18.680 --> 2:02:19.760
Pull up to school in this.

2:02:19.840 --> 2:02:21.800
Look, we can break it apart.
We can sell it.

2:02:21.880 --> 2:02:22.880
KID 4: On eBay.

2:02:22.960 --> 2:02:24.040
KID 2: Everybody get, like,
a million apiece.

2:02:24.200 --> 2:02:25.480
SHURI: I wouldn't do that
if I were you guys.

2:02:25.560 --> 2:02:26.680
KID 2: Where you come from?
SHURI: From Wakanda.

2:02:26.760 --> 2:02:27.920
KID 4: What is a Wakanda?

2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:29.000
KID 5: Hey, yo!

2:02:29.720 --> 2:02:30.920
This yours?

2:02:34.720 --> 2:02:36.080
Who...

2:02:36.440 --> 2:02:37.600
Who are you?

2:05:23.600 --> 2:05:25.760
My name is King T'Challa...

2:05:25.920 --> 2:05:28.040
son of King T'Chaka.

2:05:28.200 --> 2:05:32.520
I am the sovereign ruler
of the nation of Wakanda.

2:05:32.680 --> 2:05:35.440
And for the first time
in our history...

2:05:35.600 --> 2:05:38.840
we will be sharing
our knowledge and resources...

2:05:39.000 --> 2:05:40.880
with the outside world.

2:05:41.040 --> 2:05:44.400
Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.

2:05:44.600 --> 2:05:46.000
We cannot.

2:05:47.120 --> 2:05:48.640
We must not.

2:05:48.960 --> 2:05:51.600
We will work to be an example
of how we...

2:05:51.760 --> 2:05:54.000
as brothers and sisters
on this earth...

2:05:54.160 --> 2:05:56.240
should treat each other.

2:05:56.400 --> 2:05:58.240
Now, more than ever...

2:05:59.480 --> 2:06:03.920
the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.

2:06:04.360 --> 2:06:06.280
We all know the truth.

2:06:06.440 --> 2:06:09.840
More connects us
than separates us.

2:06:10.000 --> 2:06:11.680
But in times of crisis...

2:06:11.880 --> 2:06:14.320
the wise build bridges...

2:06:14.480 --> 2:06:17.280
while the foolish
build barriers.

2:06:17.440 --> 2:06:19.480
We must find a way...

2:06:19.680 --> 2:06:22.280
to look after one another...

2:06:22.440 --> 2:06:27.160
as if we were one,
single tribe.

2:06:27.320 --> 2:06:28.800
With all due respect,
King T'Challa...

2:06:28.960 --> 2:06:30.200
what can
a nation of farmers

2:06:30.280 --> 2:06:32.160
have to offer
the rest of the world?

2:13:31.760 --> 2:13:33.760
Are you playing around
with that man again?

2:13:33.840 --> 2:13:34.840
No.
You're teasing him again.

2:13:36.280 --> 2:13:38.400
Don't wake him. He must rest.
THABO: No, I'm not.

2:13:39.360 --> 2:13:40.720
No, I'm not.

2:13:41.680 --> 2:13:42.880
SHURI: Thabo,
you're doing that.

2:13:43.080 --> 2:13:44.440
KID 2: He's doing it.
He's lying.

2:13:44.600 --> 2:13:46.040
SHURI: No, he's resting.

2:13:46.320 --> 2:13:47.520
Go, go!

2:13:47.640 --> 2:13:49.480
White Wolf!

2:13:49.600 --> 2:13:50.640
Stop that!

2:13:50.800 --> 2:13:51.920
White Wolf!

2:13:54.640 --> 2:13:56.280
Good morning,
Sergeant Barnes.

2:13:57.800 --> 2:13:58.800
Bucky.

2:14:00.400 --> 2:14:01.440
How are you feeling?

2:14:02.080 --> 2:14:03.080
Good.

2:14:05.720 --> 2:14:06.800
Thank you.

2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:08.400
Come.

2:14:09.920 --> 2:14:11.800
Much more
for you to learn.
