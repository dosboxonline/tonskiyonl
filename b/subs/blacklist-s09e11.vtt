WEBVTT

00:12.220 --> 00:13.054
Colleague?

00:15.557 --> 00:16.391
Yes.

00:17.726 --> 00:18.852
And a friend.

01:04.564 --> 01:06.483
[Diener] Will you stay for the autopsy?

01:06.566 --> 01:07.400
No.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.616
-But could I have a moment?
-Of course.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.256
Dear God,

01:30.340 --> 01:32.133
I pray to you for her.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.136
Grant her eternal rest.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.347
Let light shine upon her...

01:38.765 --> 01:40.642
and may her soul rest in peace.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.986
You're absolutely certain?

01:52.070 --> 01:53.863
Yes. Apartment 3B.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.741
And VanDyke lived there or stayed there?

01:57.784 --> 01:59.202
We've gone through this.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.411
Indulge me.

02:02.580 --> 02:05.458
The GPS data points
that plotted VanDyke's whereabouts

02:05.542 --> 02:07.293
the day Elizabeth was killed,

02:07.961 --> 02:09.087
I went to each one.

02:09.170 --> 02:11.673
Every step he took that day, I've taken.

02:11.756 --> 02:14.551
Every store, restaurant,
apartment building.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.553
3B.

02:16.636 --> 02:19.139
I showed the super his photo and my badge.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.432
VanDyke lived there. Off and on.

02:23.351 --> 02:24.477
Helen Field?

02:24.561 --> 02:27.147
Sister, friend, girlfriend?
Comrade-in-arms?

02:27.230 --> 02:29.107
I still don't know yet.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.485
Weecha and I will take a run at Ms. Field.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.487
You have a case to solve.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.948
More important than solving this?

02:38.199 --> 02:40.118
It might be to Agent Park.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.010
Hey.

02:59.929 --> 03:02.098
-What are you doing here?
-Looking at you.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.642
You look good. Marriage suits you.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.312
-How's Perry?
-Peter's fine.

03:07.395 --> 03:10.565
I was texting to see
what he wants me to order him.

03:10.648 --> 03:12.525
You introduced him to our spot.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.861
Can't decide if I'm jealous or touched.

03:14.944 --> 03:16.279
You should be leaving.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.323
Preferably before he gets here.

03:24.495 --> 03:26.497
-I have a job for you.
-I already have a job.

03:26.581 --> 03:28.666
-Heard you left the academy.
-You following me?

03:28.750 --> 03:31.878
Trying to. What you're doing now,
I can't figure out.

03:31.961 --> 03:35.131
-Can't be as exciting as what we did.
-It wasn't exciting. Or legal.

03:35.215 --> 03:39.010
It was extralegal and necessary,
and you were good at it.

03:39.510 --> 03:41.179
Which is why I'm here.

03:42.889 --> 03:46.226
I've helped start an organization.
The Conglomerate.

03:47.018 --> 03:48.561
The answer's no.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.688
-You don't even know the question.
-Sure I do.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.232
And it's not about work.

03:59.030 --> 03:59.864
Well...

04:03.117 --> 04:04.744
In case you change your mind.

04:05.620 --> 04:06.454
I won't.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.791
I hope that's not true.

04:14.837 --> 04:16.506
-Hey.
-Hi.

04:19.008 --> 04:20.218
I'm Peter.

04:20.301 --> 04:21.219
John.

04:21.302 --> 04:24.305
Alina and I used to work together.

04:24.389 --> 04:25.265
Really?

04:25.348 --> 04:26.432
Do tell.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.643
-She likes to keep me in the dark.
-I bet.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.687
John was just leaving.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.022
-See what I mean?
-Another time.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.482
Nice to meet you.

04:34.565 --> 04:36.985
Alina, it's always a pleasure.

04:44.867 --> 04:47.203
So, what'd you do together?

04:48.246 --> 04:50.581
Oh, uh, you know, kill people.

04:51.582 --> 04:52.417
Right.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.544
Serves me right for asking.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.130
Did you order? I'm starving.

04:57.213 --> 04:58.256
I didn't.

04:58.339 --> 05:01.134
But sorry, I got a text from work.
I have to go.

05:01.217 --> 05:02.093
I'm sorry.

05:02.176 --> 05:03.720
Don't be sorry. Go.

05:04.220 --> 05:05.263
Save the planet.

05:05.346 --> 05:08.099
Or whatever it is you do
that you can't tell me about.

05:08.182 --> 05:11.394
-I've been trying to answer more.
-And I'm trying to ask less.

05:13.104 --> 05:13.980
Look at us.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.649
Quite a team.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.081
We all know governments
sanction assassinations

05:32.165 --> 05:33.708
through their intel agencies.

05:33.791 --> 05:37.795
The CIA, MI6, SVR, Mossad.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.882
According to Raymond,
four of these contract killers

05:40.965 --> 05:44.177
have formed a new organization
called the Conglomerate.

05:44.260 --> 05:46.596
Do any of you know anything about this?

05:49.766 --> 05:50.850
Me?

05:50.933 --> 05:54.854
No. I mean, I've heard rumors,
whispers of a company of assassins.

05:54.937 --> 05:58.066
Is that what this is?
A company that's privatized assassination?

05:58.149 --> 06:01.027
Yes. And Raymond says
they're taking on clients.

06:01.110 --> 06:03.112
-Does he know the clients?
-No.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.405
Only the victims.

06:05.823 --> 06:08.743
A supposedly untouchable arms dealer.

06:08.826 --> 06:11.287
A Kosovan minister accused of terrorism.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.372
A corrupt police chief.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.958
[Ressler] At least
they're targeting bad guys.

06:16.042 --> 06:16.918
[Dembe] For now.

06:17.001 --> 06:20.129
The Conglomerate serves
any ideology of any country.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.715
If you can pay, they'll kill. Good or bad.

06:22.799 --> 06:26.844
I'll reach out to my contact at Langley.
If I get his blessing, we're good to go.

06:28.554 --> 06:31.349
The way Raymond talked,
I thought you'd know more about this.

06:31.432 --> 06:32.475
No, I don't.

06:32.975 --> 06:34.977
I'm not sure what he was thinking.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.779
-[Park] What were you thinking?
-Agent Park.

06:44.862 --> 06:47.490
My wet work is none of your business,
or the task force's.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.158
Bad timing, I'm afraid.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.743
I have an engagement.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.995
Did you know they approached me?
Is that why?

06:53.079 --> 06:55.164
Because I'm not doing it
if you're worried.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.791
I'm not worried. I'm late.

06:56.874 --> 06:58.417
But stay. Raid the fridge.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.211
Why are you doing this to me?

07:00.294 --> 07:03.673
"Wet work" is such
a delightfully bland euphemism

07:03.756 --> 07:05.633
for the act of spilling blood.

07:05.716 --> 07:10.513
Leave it to the Russians to coin
a phrase so dripping with sangfroid.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.431
Why?

07:11.514 --> 07:14.016
There's a tin of beluga caviar in there.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.228
It'll calm even your frayed nerves,
Agent Park.

07:17.311 --> 07:18.896
Champagne, as well.

07:19.730 --> 07:21.274
Close up when you're done.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.129
[sighs]

07:49.093 --> 07:49.927
[Richter] Alina Park?

07:51.345 --> 07:52.346
John Richter.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.348
I hear you've had some excitement.

07:55.391 --> 07:56.517
Hey!

07:58.186 --> 07:59.020
Do I know you?

07:59.103 --> 08:01.814
The man you assaulted
decided to press charges.

08:01.898 --> 08:05.318
The man I assaulted
was assaulting a woman.

08:05.401 --> 08:06.819
That's why I assaulted him.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.779
-So if you're his lawyer--
-I'm not.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.199
Much to my mother's disappointment.

08:11.282 --> 08:12.658
A cop. An investigator.

08:12.742 --> 08:13.784
A fan.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.541
<i>Not every day I meet a woman</i>

08:20.625 --> 08:23.461
who smashes a man across the head
with Grande Cuvée.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.338
They were out of Jack.

08:26.839 --> 08:29.050
Sense of humor. That wasn't in your file.

08:29.634 --> 08:30.593
What file?

08:31.177 --> 08:33.262
Are you happy at the academy?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.015
Who are you?

08:41.604 --> 08:45.858
Most people don't realize anger
is the purest expression of care we have.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.652
Rage comes from a lack of control.

08:47.735 --> 08:50.446
A fear you can't protect yourself
or the people you care about.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.366
From the amount of anger
I noted in your file...

08:54.200 --> 08:56.869
I imagine you are
an incredibly caring person.

08:59.497 --> 09:00.706
That's why I'm here.

09:02.667 --> 09:03.876
To see for myself.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.722
What do you want from me?

09:17.223 --> 09:18.140
Right now?

09:20.643 --> 09:23.187
I can't think of anything
I don't want from you.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.623
[Park] <i>I wasn't honest before.</i>

09:42.707 --> 09:46.168
<i>I do know about the Conglomerate.</i>
<i>In fact, I was asked to join it.</i>

09:46.836 --> 09:49.005
You were asked
to join a team of assassins?

09:49.088 --> 09:49.964
Yes.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.799
Why?

09:51.882 --> 09:53.092
Because I am one.

09:56.887 --> 09:57.763
Okay.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.890
That's funny. That's funny.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.310
I thought you actually had a lead.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.436
I do.

10:05.521 --> 10:07.607
A member gave me that this morning.

10:07.690 --> 10:11.360
He's ex-CIA. He's recruiting me now
because he recruited me then.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.739
-You're with the Agency.
-If I told you, I'd have to kill you.

10:14.822 --> 10:16.115
That's such a bad joke.

10:16.198 --> 10:17.783
In this case, it's true.

10:19.368 --> 10:20.953
Okay, I'll bite.

10:21.037 --> 10:24.040
Why is not-the-Agency
keeping a file on me?

10:26.751 --> 10:28.002
Aye Su.

10:28.085 --> 10:30.171
An infamous Burmese junta leader.

10:30.254 --> 10:32.965
Aye Su is why the CIA is interested in me?

10:33.049 --> 10:35.551
He's a repressive ethnic cleanser.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.678
He's a monster.
What's that got to do with me?

10:37.762 --> 10:40.473
Your file suggests you have
a low tolerance for monsters.

10:40.556 --> 10:41.891
Doesn't everyone?

10:42.516 --> 10:45.311
It also suggests you're willing
to do something about it.

10:46.103 --> 10:46.937
[Aram] <i>Wait. Hold on.</i>

10:47.021 --> 10:49.148
You make it sound like
it was a pick-up line.

10:49.231 --> 10:51.817
Like he just sat down and was like,
"Hey, how you doing?

10:51.901 --> 10:54.153
Wanna kill a military strongman?"

10:54.236 --> 10:56.280
I didn't wanna just kill
a military strongman.

10:56.364 --> 10:58.783
I was asked by my government
to assassinate a monster.

10:58.866 --> 11:00.159
And you said yes.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.244
I'm still trying to understand why.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.663
[Park] <i>Why don't I wanna date him?</i>

11:03.746 --> 11:06.248
Because he's a 30-year-old
who works at a movie theater.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.210
<i>Don't play him like that.</i>
<i>He runs a chain of movie theaters.</i>

11:09.293 --> 11:12.213
That's so exciting.
Wait, let me grab my lingerie.

11:12.296 --> 11:13.547
<i>Boring is good.</i>

11:13.631 --> 11:17.009
<i>Boring is 2.2 kids, a dog and a pension.</i>

11:17.093 --> 11:18.719
Fine. Have Mr. Boring call.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.471
But it's not going anywhere.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.809
[phone dialing]

11:28.354 --> 11:29.438
[Richter] <i>I knew you'd call.</i>

11:29.522 --> 11:32.817
If I say yes,
what exactly would I have to do?

11:32.900 --> 11:35.111
<i>After Keen died</i>
<i>and the task force broke up,</i>

11:35.194 --> 11:38.155
I was kind of lost.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.658
Acting out. Looking for something.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.368
For a purpose.

11:42.451 --> 11:44.620
You found it by assassinating a dictator?

11:44.703 --> 11:46.956
You may not agree with it, but I did.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.833
It was sanctioned by the government.

11:48.916 --> 11:51.627
The people who made the decisions
could be held accountable.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.212
That's not happening with them.

11:53.295 --> 11:55.256
We can discuss
that fine distinction later.

11:55.339 --> 11:58.092
For now, I care about
your willingness to help us go after them.

11:58.175 --> 11:59.385
Murder Incorporated?

11:59.468 --> 12:01.095
Absolutely.

12:01.178 --> 12:03.013
Even if it means using this guy

12:03.097 --> 12:05.766
to get the names of everyone else
in the organization.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.811
-Yeah. I'm willing.
-Good.

12:08.894 --> 12:11.105
Then I want you to call your contact.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.314
Tell him you're in.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.862
Did you know that camels
have been domesticated

12:17.945 --> 12:22.199
for over 4000 years?

12:24.076 --> 12:25.661
Who are you?

12:25.744 --> 12:26.579
What do you want?

12:26.662 --> 12:28.664
Who I am is not important.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.791
What matters is that you

12:30.875 --> 12:33.210
are Helen from Apartment 3B.

12:33.294 --> 12:36.380
If this is because of Ken,
I had nothing to do with that.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.674
Amazing animals, camels.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.718
Their urine is said to cure hair loss.

12:40.801 --> 12:43.471
Say the word,
I'll give your scalp a tingle.

12:44.388 --> 12:45.556
What is going on?

12:46.599 --> 12:47.600
Why am I here?

12:47.683 --> 12:50.144
Are you two like a couple of freaks?

12:50.644 --> 12:51.812
Charles VanDyke.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.856
You're here to tell me about him.

12:55.065 --> 12:55.900
Charlie?

12:57.902 --> 12:59.195
I haven't seen him in years.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.906
I'm sure. Probably not since I killed him.

13:03.032 --> 13:03.866
Please.

13:04.575 --> 13:05.826
Mister.

13:05.910 --> 13:09.288
I don't know what it is you want,
but I'll give it to you.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.207
I want names.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.166
Friends.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.083
Colleagues.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.502
Acquaintances.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.962
And anything VanDyke left behind.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.297
Papers.

13:18.380 --> 13:19.215
Books.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.382
Bank records.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.467
Computers.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.802
You look like you collect things.

13:23.886 --> 13:25.930
I want what you've collected from Charlie.

13:26.013 --> 13:26.931
Okay.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.099
Okay. Yeah. Sure.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.352
Elizabeth Keen?

13:33.479 --> 13:34.980
I don't know who that is.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.524
He never mentioned her?

13:37.024 --> 13:37.858
Never.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.236
Two quarts! We're good to go.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.320
I swear.

13:41.403 --> 13:42.780
He never mentioned her.

13:44.156 --> 13:44.990
We'll see.

13:56.085 --> 13:56.961
He's here.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.090
[Aram] Of course.

14:01.590 --> 14:02.508
Of course what?

14:02.591 --> 14:04.426
Samar's ex. This guy.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.888
What is it with these
supermodel-y assassins?

14:11.475 --> 14:12.643
Hey.

14:12.726 --> 14:14.770
I'm glad you reached out.

14:14.853 --> 14:18.274
I know what we're doing is all
cloak-and-dagger but a parking garage?

14:18.357 --> 14:20.317
Yeah, sorry about that.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.653
<i>I have an appointment nearby.</i>
<i>I wanted to see you,</i>

14:22.736 --> 14:25.114
so I figured I'd kill two birds
with one stone.

14:25.197 --> 14:26.740
Tell me who's involved.

14:26.824 --> 14:30.369
-How's married life?
-Not signing on till I know the players.

14:30.452 --> 14:31.620
Are you happy?

14:32.454 --> 14:35.541
-Would you hate me if I hope you're not?
-Peter and I are fine.

14:37.459 --> 14:39.044
You ever think about Cuba?

14:39.128 --> 14:39.962
[Ressler] Cuba.

14:40.462 --> 14:41.964
Let's think about Cuba.

14:46.927 --> 14:49.096
Any chance you're gonna focus
on why we're here?

14:49.179 --> 14:50.097
Yeah.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.181
In a minute.

15:00.941 --> 15:01.775
Who's that?

15:01.859 --> 15:02.943
My appointment.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.113
Be right back.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.204
-Where's he going? Is he on a job?
-We have to stop him.

15:14.288 --> 15:17.875
If he's not and you run in, I'm blown.
We'll never learn about the Conglomerate.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.044
-[Ressler] <i>Price I'm willing to pay.</i>
-I'll go.

15:20.127 --> 15:23.005
If it's nothing, he won't be suspicious.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.866
[man speaks in Russian]

15:56.789 --> 15:57.915
[in Russian] Who hired you?

15:58.457 --> 16:00.250
They'll kill me if I say.

16:01.377 --> 16:04.254
I'll kill you if you don't.

16:05.506 --> 16:06.757
[gunshots]

16:07.758 --> 16:09.259
Park, are you okay?

16:11.428 --> 16:12.429
We have to go!

16:12.513 --> 16:15.474
-I take it this means you're in.
-We have to go now.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.495
[Cooper] You have any idea
what you've done?

16:36.578 --> 16:40.165
-Never heard Harold raise his voice.
-Here's the reason why he is.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.835
[Cooper] You saved an assassin
by assassinating his target!

16:42.918 --> 16:44.211
Trouble in paradise?

16:44.294 --> 16:45.796
Yeah. Stirred up by you.

16:45.879 --> 16:47.339
By me?

16:47.840 --> 16:51.260
Forgive me, I guess
I was under the false impression

16:51.343 --> 16:53.053
that we were all adults here.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.221
Thank God we're not.

16:54.304 --> 16:56.140
I saw a gun and I reacted.

16:56.223 --> 16:59.518
The man you shot could have been
a whistleblower or an undercover cop.

16:59.601 --> 17:00.853
He was Vor.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.021
You didn't know.

17:02.104 --> 17:05.482
All you knew was you were choosing
a killer over a stranger.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.943
I don't know what I'm more disturbed by,
your actions

17:08.027 --> 17:10.487
or that you can't acknowledge
this was personal.

17:10.571 --> 17:11.613
It was.

17:11.697 --> 17:12.614
It isn't now.

17:13.532 --> 17:16.160
It sounded personal to Ressler and Aram.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.245
And before you say they're wrong

17:18.328 --> 17:20.372
-or there's nothing going on--
-There isn't.

17:20.456 --> 17:22.916
Before you say something
that isn't 100% accurate,

17:23.000 --> 17:24.168
I want you to stop.

17:24.251 --> 17:25.711
Take a moment.

17:25.794 --> 17:27.880
And know that given what happened,

17:27.963 --> 17:31.091
if you say anything short
of the absolute truth...

17:31.592 --> 17:32.926
I will let you go.

17:33.719 --> 17:34.887
[Ressler] <i>A turtle statue?</i>

17:34.970 --> 17:36.472
A tortoise.

17:36.555 --> 17:37.765
Hingeback, I believe.

17:37.848 --> 17:38.766
[Aram] He's tied to it.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.476
Your tech guy.

17:40.976 --> 17:42.936
For the next 36 hours.

17:43.020 --> 17:46.690
Part of some kind of a pledge drive

17:46.774 --> 17:49.109
or pledge of allegiance?

17:49.193 --> 17:50.110
Pledge week.

17:50.194 --> 17:51.487
Yes. That's it.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.113
A week of pledging.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.157
To what, I have no idea.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.534
The point is, he's indisposed

17:57.618 --> 17:59.328
and this can't wait.

17:59.411 --> 18:00.829
It was VanDyke's.

18:00.913 --> 18:04.666
I had a nice chat with Helen from 3B.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.293
Ah, which reminds me.

18:08.295 --> 18:09.713
We brought camel's milk.

18:10.464 --> 18:11.924
We had some left over.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.718
Do you have any idea
who helped VanDyke find Liz?

18:14.802 --> 18:15.886
Not yet.

18:15.969 --> 18:19.139
I'm hoping there's a lead buried in here

18:19.223 --> 18:21.225
that Agent Mojtabai can root out.

18:21.308 --> 18:23.393
[Park] <i>I didn't know Liz as well as you.</i>

18:23.477 --> 18:25.062
But I'm only here because of her.

18:25.145 --> 18:29.650
She saw me, warts and all,
and for whatever reason embraced that.

18:29.733 --> 18:31.735
Losing her was like losing
my guardian angel,

18:31.819 --> 18:35.405
and whatever rage wagon
I was on, I fell off it.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.407
Until I met John.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.952
He gave me purpose.

18:44.998 --> 18:47.251
[in Burmese] I don't care what
the Secretary General says,

18:47.334 --> 18:51.421
they're not refugees,
they're enemies of the state.

18:56.718 --> 18:57.719
You.

18:58.428 --> 18:59.346
You!

18:59.429 --> 19:00.973
Out!

19:13.235 --> 19:14.653
[Red] It's salty.

19:14.736 --> 19:15.737
Very.

19:16.405 --> 19:17.739
A little disgusting.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.741
But sort of delicious.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.076
There's nothing encrypted.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.370
But there is this.

19:23.453 --> 19:26.790
A series of GPS coordinates
from the day Liz died.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.961
We already mapped VanDyke
using his phone's GPS.

19:31.044 --> 19:33.297
Right. We did. They might be the same.

19:33.380 --> 19:34.840
But maybe not.

19:34.923 --> 19:38.135
So I'm putting
the phone coordinates in blue

19:38.218 --> 19:40.345
and the computer coordinates in red.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.264
And if I overlay them...

19:44.683 --> 19:45.851
[Dembe] They don't overlap.

19:45.934 --> 19:46.977
Except in two places.

19:47.060 --> 19:51.315
The cafe where you gave Liz the letter
and the restaurant where Liz was killed.

19:51.398 --> 19:52.816
Two people were following her.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.526
No. Only one.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.904
VanDyke's blue. Who's red?

19:58.405 --> 19:59.364
Elizabeth.

20:00.657 --> 20:01.700
Train.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.327
Safe house.

20:03.410 --> 20:04.661
Coffee shop.

20:04.745 --> 20:05.704
Restaurant.

20:07.497 --> 20:09.082
He was tracking her.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.500
Using her phone?

20:10.584 --> 20:11.710
[Aram] I don't think so.

20:11.793 --> 20:15.964
This software received signals
from a next-gen tracking device.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.634
If we can find the tracker,
it might have a signature,

20:18.717 --> 20:20.594
something that could tell us who made it.

20:20.677 --> 20:24.932
Whoever made it wanted Keen dead
or was working for the person who did.

20:25.015 --> 20:27.184
We need to find that device.

20:28.018 --> 20:30.687
[Cooper] I appreciate that
you were vulnerable at the time.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.565
It may have felt
that he was giving you purpose,

20:34.274 --> 20:36.109
but I see it as taking advantage of you.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.737
Yes, but...

20:39.529 --> 20:41.490
he also helped get me out.

20:44.785 --> 20:47.913
[In Burmese] I have her. The shooter.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.836
-You were gonna wait in the car.
-What can I say? I missed you.

20:59.883 --> 21:01.009
Come on.

21:03.136 --> 21:06.014
If I took a bullet for you,
would you let me take you out?

21:06.098 --> 21:08.141
-That's the only way I would.
-Hey.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.980
I hear Playa Paraiso
is beautiful this time of year.

21:15.232 --> 21:18.360
He was right.
It was beautiful that time of year.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.698
You said Richter invited you
to meet his partners,

21:22.781 --> 21:24.825
-that they may ask you to join.
-That's right.

21:24.908 --> 21:27.828
And if they do, I'll help take them down.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.204
All of them, including John.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.623
Despite everything you've told me?

21:31.707 --> 21:33.542
-Yes, 100%.
-[knock on door]

21:34.710 --> 21:35.627
Excuse me.

21:35.711 --> 21:39.256
Agent Park,
I saw that you ate some beluga.

21:39.339 --> 21:40.340
I hope it helped.

21:40.424 --> 21:43.844
-Could you give us a minute?
-I'll give you as long as you'd like.

21:43.927 --> 21:48.056
I just need the clothing Elizabeth wore
on the night of the shooting.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.558
I need to examine it.

21:54.813 --> 21:59.109
I didn't know where else to do this,
you know, with you.

22:00.319 --> 22:04.239
I did what I could to clean the room
and make it respectful.

22:05.282 --> 22:06.366
The room's fine.

22:07.117 --> 22:09.077
The chatter I could do without.

22:11.163 --> 22:11.997
Okay.

22:52.996 --> 22:53.872
That's it.

22:55.290 --> 22:56.625
That's what she was wearing.

22:59.127 --> 23:02.547
If there is a tracker,
I'm sure it's no longer operational.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.467
Detector for GPS signals,

23:06.134 --> 23:08.762
wireless audio bug,
wand for foreign objects.

23:08.845 --> 23:11.973
If there's something on her,
I will find it.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.101
[Red] Not her.

23:14.893 --> 23:16.103
Her clothes.

23:16.812 --> 23:18.146
She's in the ground.

23:19.689 --> 23:21.691
I presume wearing something nice.

23:23.944 --> 23:27.906
For what it's worth,
I hope you find who you're looking for.

23:28.990 --> 23:31.243
I don't wanna know
what you're gonna do with them,

23:33.370 --> 23:34.704
but you deserve peace.

23:39.835 --> 23:42.462
[Ressler] We have a camera
in your button and a mic,

23:42.546 --> 23:44.589
so we'll be able to see
and hear everything.

23:44.673 --> 23:47.551
After Richter picks you up,
we'll follow you to the location.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.898
-You look great.
-Thanks.

24:01.982 --> 24:05.527
I wasn't sure what the dress code was
for a meet-and-greet with assassins.

24:14.870 --> 24:17.706
[Ressler] <i>Once we know where you're going,</i>
<i>we'll put a TAC team on site.</i>

24:17.789 --> 24:20.542
<i>After we ID the founders</i>
<i>and get the conspiracy on tape,</i>

24:20.625 --> 24:21.668
then we'll move in.

24:21.751 --> 24:23.795
After you've cleared the building,
not before.

24:23.879 --> 24:26.590
I don't want any of this
blowing back on you.

24:30.093 --> 24:30.927
Nervous?

24:33.096 --> 24:34.347
Confused.

24:34.848 --> 24:37.058
What we did, Su and the others,

24:37.601 --> 24:39.186
we did it for our country.

24:39.769 --> 24:41.479
Now what are we doing it for?

24:42.105 --> 24:42.981
Money.

24:44.691 --> 24:47.194
You make it sound like just business.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.488
We want job security.

24:51.114 --> 24:53.491
Something people
in our line of work have never had.

24:56.494 --> 24:58.663
It's been a thousand years
since Hassan-i Sabbah

24:58.747 --> 25:00.540
was our first documented brother-in-arms,

25:00.624 --> 25:06.129
leader of the infamous Order of Assassins,
known in Arabic as <i>Hashashin.</i>

25:06.755 --> 25:09.216
We are <i>hashashin,</i>

25:09.299 --> 25:11.760
present at turning points
throughout history,

25:11.843 --> 25:16.389
and yet for our troubles,
we've been freelancers, paid by the job,

25:16.473 --> 25:20.101
hurt, physically, emotionally,
sometimes killed.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.270
If we're lucky,

25:22.896 --> 25:25.315
thanked in secret and disavowed.

25:26.524 --> 25:28.818
How is the Conglomerate any different?

25:32.072 --> 25:36.451
The target in the garage
was a Vor named Lev Salenko.

25:37.410 --> 25:38.787
The jobs are the same.

25:39.329 --> 25:42.374
The only difference
is the price and the accounting.

25:42.457 --> 25:45.335
A percentage of what I get
goes to the person who brought me in.

25:45.418 --> 25:46.419
Once he retires,

25:47.128 --> 25:51.007
he'll continue to get his cut,
for pension and health.

25:51.716 --> 25:53.468
Sounds like a pyramid scheme.

25:54.511 --> 25:56.930
It's more like an incentive
to bring people in.

25:57.722 --> 26:00.016
Yes, that's a pyramid scheme.

26:00.100 --> 26:04.062
Is that why you're bringing me
into the pyramid, for an incentive?

26:04.813 --> 26:06.314
Ancillary benefit.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.942
What's the primary one?

26:11.278 --> 26:13.780
To learn why you were
a no-show in Tangier.

26:16.116 --> 26:17.158
I'm serious.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.953
My partners know the work we did.

26:20.036 --> 26:22.706
They know it was good work,
and they'll ask why it stopped.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.960
Getting them to bring you in
may depend on what I tell them.

26:27.961 --> 26:28.837
So...

26:30.130 --> 26:31.589
what should I tell them?

26:35.385 --> 26:37.304
[Park] I didn't bring a suitcase
to send a signal.

26:37.387 --> 26:39.973
I brought a suitcase
because I have a plane to catch.

26:41.057 --> 26:44.185
Yes, I'll keep in mind
the 2.2 kids, the dog, the cat

26:44.269 --> 26:48.273
and the minister who pronounces us
Mr. and Mrs. Stupendously Boring.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.567
Yeah, love you too.

26:53.153 --> 26:54.654
I'm allergic to cats.

26:56.865 --> 27:00.327
As for the 2.2 kids, I should warn you,

27:00.410 --> 27:02.954
with everything they'll have to overcome,

27:03.038 --> 27:04.873
0.2 is gonna be my favorite.

27:04.956 --> 27:07.625
Talk about marginalized.
They'd have their own letter.

27:07.709 --> 27:12.339
LGBTQIAP. For "partial."

27:12.422 --> 27:16.468
You know, 0.2 is, what, maybe a hand?

27:17.677 --> 27:18.595
A finger?

27:19.304 --> 27:21.681
I'm tearing up thinking about
walking my little thumb

27:21.765 --> 27:23.558
down the aisle at its wedding.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.186
Listening as the minister asks:

27:26.269 --> 27:30.398
"Do you, thumb, take you, index,

27:31.024 --> 27:33.276
to be your lawfully wedded digit,

27:33.360 --> 27:37.864
in hangnail and dislocation,
as long as you both shall wave?"

27:38.948 --> 27:41.493
What if thumb falls for middle?

27:42.452 --> 27:43.286
You know...

27:43.912 --> 27:45.288
-the bad boy?
-The bad boy.

27:46.748 --> 27:49.584
Passing thing. Good for a fling.

27:49.667 --> 27:52.796
Maybe even a trip.

27:53.755 --> 27:57.133
But in the end, she'll end up with index.

27:57.217 --> 27:59.511
-How can you be so sure?
-<i>Casablanca.</i>

27:59.594 --> 28:00.470
What?

28:01.221 --> 28:04.516
Okay. You may run a movie theater,
but you know nothing about the movies.

28:04.599 --> 28:06.643
Ilsa did not go for index in <i>Casablanca.</i>

28:06.726 --> 28:10.230
Excuse you, Paul Henreid
is the personification of index.

28:10.313 --> 28:13.525
Yeah, but she loved Humphrey Bogart,
who is completely middle.

28:13.608 --> 28:17.862
So she went away with one guy
instead of staying with the guy she loved?

28:17.946 --> 28:19.489
She went because of work.

28:20.115 --> 28:24.911
It was important to her,
and she sacrificed her happiness for it.

28:24.994 --> 28:26.538
Who would do that?

28:27.831 --> 28:29.499
[Richter] <i>That's the reason</i>
<i>you didn't come?</i>

28:29.582 --> 28:31.626
Because he's an index finger.

28:31.709 --> 28:33.753
-That's why I skipped Tangier.
-Mm-mm.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.632
I skipped everything else because...

28:38.758 --> 28:40.218
he makes me laugh.

28:47.100 --> 28:48.810
You said you could find it.

28:48.893 --> 28:52.021
I could, or would, if it was here,
but it's not.

28:53.440 --> 28:57.736
Someone tracked Elizabeth
until the moment she died.

28:57.819 --> 29:01.030
At which point, the police came, took her,

29:01.114 --> 29:03.450
everything was bagged and tagged.

29:04.367 --> 29:07.078
The chain of evidence,
who was in charge of it?

29:09.080 --> 29:10.165
Park.

29:12.792 --> 29:14.919
You knew Agent Park was an assassin,

29:15.003 --> 29:17.589
that after Liz died,
she took a job killing people.

29:17.672 --> 29:18.882
I did.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.134
That didn't bother you?

29:21.217 --> 29:23.595
Ineptitude bothers me.

29:23.678 --> 29:27.098
A lack of originality, margarine.

29:27.849 --> 29:30.560
This, and most everything else,

29:30.643 --> 29:33.813
up to and including
Agent Park's trigger finger,

29:34.647 --> 29:36.775
deck chairs on the<i> Titanic.</i>

29:41.654 --> 29:44.032
[Richter] Alina Park
belongs in the Conglomerate.

29:44.532 --> 29:46.576
In eight months, she completed four jobs.

29:46.659 --> 29:51.289
<i>Four jobs so extraordinary she received</i>
<i>the Distinguished Intelligence Cross...</i>

29:51.372 --> 29:55.210
-More to the left.
<i>-...awarded by the agency "for heroism</i>

29:55.293 --> 29:57.504
involving the acceptance
of existing dangers

29:57.587 --> 30:01.174
-with fortitude and exemplary courage."
-Exemplary courage.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.802
[Simmons] <i>Your record is distinguished,</i>

30:03.885 --> 30:06.346
but not your commitment.

30:06.429 --> 30:07.722
Eight months?

30:08.431 --> 30:10.141
Nothing before or since?

30:10.225 --> 30:14.020
If you are as able
as Mr. Richter says you are,

30:14.562 --> 30:15.897
why did you stop?

30:17.065 --> 30:18.650
Killing was easy.

30:18.733 --> 30:20.026
Laughter was hard.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.237
I needed more of it.

30:22.320 --> 30:26.449
Michael Simmons, former SAS,
12 targets, eight kills.

30:26.533 --> 30:29.744
Mirko Ibrahimović, sniper, DGSE,

30:29.828 --> 30:32.831
answered directly
to the French Ministry of Defense.

30:32.914 --> 30:35.500
Colleen Riano, former CNI, Spain,

30:35.583 --> 30:38.753
responsible for at least
40 deaths that we know about.

30:39.420 --> 30:42.006
Are these people heroes or terrorists?

30:42.090 --> 30:44.300
[Simmons] <i>Thanks for coming in.</i>
<i>That'll be all.</i>

30:48.179 --> 30:50.181
-They look disappointed.
-They loved you.

30:50.265 --> 30:52.308
-How can you be so sure?
-You're still alive.

30:52.851 --> 30:56.563
The vote's a formality. They love you.
I love you. You're very lovable.

30:56.646 --> 30:59.107
Hey. We have to celebrate tonight.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.151
And by celebrate, I mean have sex.

31:02.235 --> 31:04.320
Name the hotel, I'll get us a room.

31:10.285 --> 31:11.202
Goodbye.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.414
[Ressler] <i>We have everything we need.</i>
<i>TAC team's in position.</i>

31:14.497 --> 31:16.875
I will sleep with you anywhere, anytime.

31:16.958 --> 31:19.127
It's a perk of the job, like dental.

31:20.837 --> 31:21.838
I'm clear.

31:32.849 --> 31:34.392
[phone ringing]

31:48.615 --> 31:50.742
I have nothing to say to you.

31:50.825 --> 31:52.827
I'm not calling about the Conglomerate.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.413
I know, because thanks to you,
there is no Conglomerate.

31:55.496 --> 31:58.499
The TAC team went in.
They arrested them. It's over.

31:58.583 --> 31:59.959
I'm calling about Elizabeth.

32:00.043 --> 32:03.379
It was the right thing. But I don't like
you nosing around in my business.

32:03.463 --> 32:04.964
Richter is a good person.

32:05.048 --> 32:07.383
You were with her after the shooting.

32:07.467 --> 32:09.636
<i>-You rode with her.</i>
-I care about him.

32:09.719 --> 32:11.846
And he cares about you.

32:11.930 --> 32:15.308
He recruited you once
and wanted to recruit you again.

32:15.391 --> 32:17.268
<i>You said yes the first time.</i>

32:17.352 --> 32:21.189
<i>-I couldn't risk a repeat performance.</i>
-You couldn't risk it?

32:21.272 --> 32:23.149
I have unfinished business.

32:23.232 --> 32:24.901
We have unfinished business.

32:25.526 --> 32:27.654
-Finding Liz's killer.
<i>-Yes.</i>

32:27.737 --> 32:30.615
Which may not be possible without you.

32:30.698 --> 32:32.992
That sounds vaguely complimentary.

32:33.701 --> 32:35.328
I need you, Agent Park.

32:35.411 --> 32:38.539
That's why I put the Conglomerate
on the Blacklist.

32:38.623 --> 32:40.249
<i>I can't afford to lose you.</i>

32:41.167 --> 32:44.003
Yeah. I rode with her
to the morgue. What of it?

32:44.963 --> 32:48.299
The person who orchestrated the hit
put a tracker on her,

32:48.383 --> 32:52.303
a tracker that might give us
a clue as to their identity,

32:52.387 --> 32:53.888
<i>if we can find it.</i>

32:53.972 --> 32:57.558
<i>Aram and I looked through</i>
<i>the evidence on file,</i>

32:57.642 --> 32:59.811
evidence you signed for,

32:59.894 --> 33:01.396
but it wasn't there.

33:01.479 --> 33:04.857
-You sure there was a tracker?
-Yes. We have coordinates.

33:04.941 --> 33:06.693
Then you have your answer.

33:06.776 --> 33:10.071
You wanna find the tracker,
find the last place it transmitted from.

33:11.572 --> 33:12.490
Thank you.

33:13.074 --> 33:15.827
For proving my point
about how much I need you.

33:16.452 --> 33:19.789
<i>I'm sorry about Richter,</i>
<i>but clearly, without your help,</i>

33:19.872 --> 33:22.417
<i>I can't seem to see what's in front of me.</i>

33:23.042 --> 33:24.711
Thank you, Agent Park.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.380
[phone dialing]

33:31.175 --> 33:32.260
<i>Hello?</i>

33:32.343 --> 33:35.555
Aram, I know how to find
what we're looking for.

33:39.559 --> 33:42.478
Honey? I picked up dinner
from Biryani Kebab.

33:42.562 --> 33:45.314
I told them you had a chili allergy,
so if it's not mild, I--

33:45.398 --> 33:46.399
[Richter] Hi, honey.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.112
Tough day at the office?

33:51.988 --> 33:53.197
Join us.

33:54.323 --> 33:55.825
I said, join us.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.040
To a job well done.

34:02.123 --> 34:04.584
-Yeah, about that, it's not done.
-Richter's missing.

34:04.667 --> 34:07.211
We clocked six in the meeting.
The TAC team arrested six.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.213
Turns out, one was a guard
waiting outside.

34:09.297 --> 34:11.841
-Have you informed Agent Park?
-She's not picking up.

34:11.924 --> 34:13.885
You think Richter
connected her to the raid?

34:13.968 --> 34:16.888
I don't know. If he has, she's in danger.
Get to her house now.

34:23.853 --> 34:26.898
Why'd you do it?
Don't deny it, I know it was you.

34:26.981 --> 34:28.107
They'll come here.

34:28.191 --> 34:30.735
Did you do it for him?
Because he makes you laugh?

34:30.818 --> 34:33.279
If you leave now, you can get away.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.620
Did she tell you what we used to do?

34:40.703 --> 34:41.746
The work we did?

34:45.166 --> 34:46.918
Alina, what's going on?

34:47.001 --> 34:49.796
-It's gonna be--
-Hey, hey! Focus.

34:50.421 --> 34:51.547
Focus.

34:51.631 --> 34:54.300
What we did together, did she tell you?

34:54.926 --> 34:57.220
[Peter] She said you killed people.

34:57.303 --> 34:59.430
Shot, stabbed, blew up.
Your wife's a killer.

34:59.514 --> 35:01.224
-Leave him out of this.
-Why?

35:01.307 --> 35:04.102
-He's the reason we're here.
-What's he talking about?

35:04.977 --> 35:08.189
He knows what we did, but not what we did?

35:10.775 --> 35:12.110
She left me for you.

35:12.193 --> 35:16.197
Which I came back to rectify,
and here we are.

35:18.616 --> 35:20.243
If you stay, you'll get hurt.

35:20.326 --> 35:22.703
Which is it?
Are you concerned for him or me?

35:22.787 --> 35:25.123
For him, he's my husband. I love him.

35:25.206 --> 35:26.499
You're someone I care about.

35:26.582 --> 35:28.751
Whatever happened today
doesn't change that.

35:29.252 --> 35:31.921
I didn't wanna see you arrested,
and I don't want you hurt.

35:32.004 --> 35:33.673
Especially not by me.

35:34.173 --> 35:35.007
You?

35:36.050 --> 35:38.678
You talk so much
you don't even hear what you say.

35:39.220 --> 35:41.639
You wanna be heard, but you never listen.

35:43.015 --> 35:46.102
Anger is the purest expression
of care we have.

35:46.185 --> 35:49.021
Rage comes from the lack of control.

35:49.105 --> 35:52.525
A fear that you can't protect yourself
or the people you care about.

35:52.608 --> 35:54.652
And from the amount of anger in your file,

35:54.735 --> 35:59.157
I knew you were an incredibly
caring person. Yeah, I know what I said.

36:00.408 --> 36:03.202
-But you don't know what it means.
-And what's that?

36:04.662 --> 36:06.664
It means I'm gonna kick your ass.

36:41.741 --> 36:42.742
[Richter shouts]

36:52.877 --> 36:54.962
[Park grunting]

37:13.898 --> 37:15.399
I'm so sorry.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.236
If anything had happened to you...

37:18.319 --> 37:20.279
-I'm okay.
-Really?

37:20.363 --> 37:23.115
No cuts, bruises?
Nothing broken? Let me see.

37:23.199 --> 37:25.284
-Peter, look at me.
-I'd rather not.

37:32.375 --> 37:33.376
I'm fine.

37:36.003 --> 37:37.630
I'm not so sure about you.

37:41.384 --> 37:42.760
[Dembe] Alina!

37:46.806 --> 37:47.932
Park, are you hurt?

37:49.850 --> 37:50.685
No.

37:51.852 --> 37:53.854
At least not in the way you mean.

37:59.610 --> 38:01.445
Weecha, hi.

38:01.988 --> 38:04.907
It's, um... Aram. Remember?

38:05.783 --> 38:08.494
Uh... The one
you can drink under the table.

38:13.499 --> 38:15.001
He's in a bad mood.

38:15.876 --> 38:17.545
I had a bad reading.

38:17.628 --> 38:19.005
The flowers.

38:19.088 --> 38:22.091
Apparently, they show ambiguity.

38:23.050 --> 38:24.385
Okay.

38:24.885 --> 38:27.596
Well, on the one hand, I have good news.

38:28.389 --> 38:31.017
I did what you asked,
and the tracker on Liz,

38:31.100 --> 38:35.187
I used VanDyke's computer
and got the location of its last signal.

38:35.271 --> 38:38.524
-Which means we have a lead.
-That's the good news.

38:38.607 --> 38:40.234
I also have some bad news.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.570
Of course you do. Look at the flowers.

38:43.237 --> 38:44.113
What is it?

38:44.822 --> 38:47.491
The tracker's last signal
came from Rose Hill.

38:48.951 --> 38:50.911
The cemetery where Liz is buried.

38:55.499 --> 38:58.961
You guys should get out of here.
You know, go to a hotel.

38:59.045 --> 39:01.088
CSI is gonna be here all night.

39:01.589 --> 39:05.509
Which murder are they gonna investigate,
Richter's or my marriage?

39:06.052 --> 39:08.012
After tonight, they're both dead.

39:08.095 --> 39:09.972
Come on, you don't know that.

39:12.224 --> 39:15.436
I never thought I made
the wrong choice ever.

39:15.519 --> 39:17.730
I'm sure he feels the same way.

39:18.814 --> 39:20.316
I'm afraid to ask him.

39:20.858 --> 39:22.068
Afraid?

39:22.151 --> 39:25.571
The CIA gave you an award
for extraordinary heroism

39:25.654 --> 39:30.159
and exemplary courage,
which is all very impressive, by the way.

39:30.242 --> 39:32.119
So go.

39:32.953 --> 39:34.372
Be extraordinary.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.263
You don't have to do that.

40:00.898 --> 40:02.233
That was John's.

40:03.526 --> 40:04.777
[scoffs]

40:04.860 --> 40:05.945
Of course it was.

40:06.028 --> 40:09.949
What did he smoke, Gauloises?
On a balcony in Monte Carlo?

40:10.032 --> 40:12.284
You know what? It doesn't matter.

40:12.368 --> 40:13.744
I don't care about him.

40:14.578 --> 40:16.831
What I care about is you.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.669
You once told me
that you weren't honest with me

40:21.752 --> 40:24.630
not because I wouldn't like what I saw,

40:24.713 --> 40:26.382
but because you wouldn't.

40:26.465 --> 40:30.845
That you couldn't expect me to love you
until you learned to love yourself.

40:31.595 --> 40:32.680
How's that going?

40:34.306 --> 40:37.518
It's a work in progress, like us.

40:38.227 --> 40:40.271
But I am making progress.

40:40.354 --> 40:41.897
And I hope we are too.

40:41.981 --> 40:43.357
Was tonight progress?

40:45.609 --> 40:48.404
No. But it is...

40:49.405 --> 40:53.117
the end of my keeping
any secrets from you.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.953
You are my husband, my partner.

40:56.036 --> 40:59.790
You need to know everything.
I want you to know everything.

41:01.208 --> 41:02.209
You're right.

41:03.002 --> 41:04.211
I'm not fine.

41:05.337 --> 41:09.800
And one of the reasons is because I can't
rely on the person I rely on the most.

41:09.884 --> 41:11.969
You beat a man to death.

41:13.012 --> 41:15.014
I'm not sure I can help you with that.

41:15.848 --> 41:17.099
I'm not, either.

41:17.892 --> 41:20.352
But I wanna find out.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.271
Do you?

41:31.864 --> 41:34.200
Do you know who Raymond Reddington is?

41:35.117 --> 41:36.160
Of course I do.

41:37.077 --> 41:37.912
Why?

41:40.122 --> 41:42.041
I think we better sit down.

41:49.298 --> 41:51.300
[Cooper] I'm afraid you missed Agnes.

41:53.427 --> 41:54.678
She's already in bed.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.264
I'm glad, actually.

41:57.348 --> 42:01.936
Because I've come to discuss
something with you that...

42:03.395 --> 42:05.564
perhaps it's best she not know.

42:05.648 --> 42:06.565
What's that?

42:07.900 --> 42:11.529
I think I know how to find
the person who killed her mother.

42:12.905 --> 42:14.448
Why wouldn't we want her to know?

42:14.532 --> 42:18.035
Because to find them,
we need to exhume Elizabeth's body.

42:21.539 --> 42:24.041
