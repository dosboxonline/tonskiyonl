WEBVTT

02:44.732 --> 02:45.824
Shit.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.763
You pair of deuces
lookin' for work...

04:27.835 --> 04:31.203
I suggest you get your
scrawny asses in here pronto.

04:44.085 --> 04:45.814
Up on Brokeback...

04:45.887 --> 04:48.651
the Forest Service has got
designated campsites...

04:48.723 --> 04:50.384
on the allotments.

04:50.458 --> 04:54.451
Them camps can be 3, 4 miles from
where we pasture the woollies.

04:54.529 --> 04:57.987
Bad predator loss if there's
nobody lookin' after 'em at night.

04:58.065 --> 05:01.763
Now, what I want
is a camp tender...

05:02.837 --> 05:06.136
to stay in the main camp, where
the Forest Service says.

05:06.207 --> 05:07.834
But the herder...

05:07.975 --> 05:10.945
he's gonna pitch a pup tent
on the QT with the sheep...

05:11.012 --> 05:13.071
and he's gonna sleep there.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.912
You eat your supper
and breakfast in camp...

05:15.983 --> 05:19.010
but you sleep
with the sheep 100%.

05:19.687 --> 05:22.179
No fire, don't leave no sign.

05:22.924 --> 05:24.414
You roll up that tent
every mornin'...

05:24.492 --> 05:25.925
in case Forest Service
snoops around.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.188
Yeah?

05:31.065 --> 05:32.089
No.

05:33.301 --> 05:34.393
[man chattering on phone)

05:34.468 --> 05:35.458
No!

05:38.039 --> 05:40.030
Not on your fuckin' life.

05:43.044 --> 05:46.844
You got your dogs,
your .30-30, you sleep there.

05:47.448 --> 05:51.510
Last summer I had goddamn near 25% loss.
I don't want that again.

05:52.053 --> 05:53.111
You.

05:54.655 --> 05:57.386
Fridays at noon,
be down at the bridge...

05:57.792 --> 06:00.192
with your grocery list
and mules...

06:00.261 --> 06:03.959
and somebody with supplies
will be there at the pick-up.

06:06.601 --> 06:09.900
Tomorrow mornin' we'll
truck you up to the jump-off.

06:38.299 --> 06:40.893
- Jack Twist.
- Ennis.

06:42.336 --> 06:45.602
- Your folks just stop at Ennis?
- Del Mar.

06:47.275 --> 06:49.539
Well, nice to know you,
Ennis Del Mar.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.491
[man chattering on TV)

07:07.962 --> 07:09.862
My second year up here.

07:11.098 --> 07:14.398
Last year, one storm, the
lightnin' killed 42 sheep.

07:15.603 --> 07:18.197
Thought I'd asphyxiate
from the smell.

07:18.606 --> 07:23.009
Aguirre got all over my ass, like I
was supposed to control the weather.

07:23.177 --> 07:27.307
But beats workin' for my old man.
Can't please my old man, no way.

07:29.016 --> 07:32.680
That's why I took
to rodeoin'. You ever rodeo?

07:34.221 --> 07:37.123
You know, I mean,
once in a while.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.384
When I got the entry fee
in my pocket.

07:40.461 --> 07:41.553
Yeah.

07:42.964 --> 07:44.989
Are you from ranch people?

07:45.132 --> 07:46.532
Yeah, I was.

07:48.269 --> 07:50.169
Your folks run you off?

07:51.339 --> 07:54.137
No, they run themselves off.
There was...

07:55.543 --> 07:58.876
one curve in the road in
43 miles, and they miss it.

08:00.548 --> 08:03.347
So the bank took the ranch...

08:03.417 --> 08:06.512
and my brother and sister,
they raised me, mostly.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.519
Shit, that's hard.

08:16.731 --> 08:19.029
Can I? Thank you.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.549
Don't let them stray.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.520
Joe will have your ass
if you do.

08:42.590 --> 08:45.218
Only thing,
don't never order soup.

08:45.726 --> 08:48.127
Them soup boxes
are hard to pack.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.529
Well, I don't eat soup.

08:55.803 --> 08:59.501
You wanna watch it there. That
horse has a low startle point.

09:00.041 --> 09:02.737
Doubt there's a filly
that could throw me.

09:03.377 --> 09:07.075
Let's git, unless you wanna sit
around tyin' knots all day.

11:50.244 --> 11:51.336
Oh, shit.

11:51.679 --> 11:53.408
Can't wait till I get
my own spread...

11:53.480 --> 11:56.746
and I won't have to put up with
Joe Aguirre's crap no more.

11:57.318 --> 11:59.548
I'm savin' for a place myself.

12:01.689 --> 12:05.955
Alma and me, we're gonna get married
when I come down off this mountain.

12:06.060 --> 12:09.223
Shit, that stay with the
sheep, no fire bullshit.

12:10.698 --> 12:14.532
Aguirre got no right makin' us
do somethin' against the rules.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.375
No more beans.

13:39.420 --> 13:41.616
Damn. Shit!

13:45.492 --> 13:47.620
- I don't know.
- Something wrong?

13:48.929 --> 13:50.124
Yeah, so what...

13:50.197 --> 13:52.825
Why didn't we get the
powdered milk and the spuds?

13:52.900 --> 13:54.390
That's all we got.

13:55.002 --> 13:56.231
Well...

13:57.071 --> 13:58.766
Here's next week's.

14:01.275 --> 14:04.734
- Thought you didn't eat soup.
- Yeah, well, I'm sick of beans.

14:04.812 --> 14:07.713
Too early in the summer
to be sick of beans.

14:10.484 --> 14:11.713
Come on.

14:34.608 --> 14:36.167
Come on. Come on.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.181
Hold on.

14:52.826 --> 14:53.816
Shit.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.919
Come back here!

15:35.402 --> 15:36.927
There...

15:37.070 --> 15:38.834
All right. Fuck it.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.207
Okay, you bastard.

15:45.546 --> 15:46.979
Where the hell you been?

15:47.047 --> 15:49.539
Been up with the sheep all day, I
get down here hungry as hell...

15:49.616 --> 15:51.551
and all I find is beans.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.152
What in the hell happened,
Ennis?

15:58.425 --> 16:00.826
I come on a bear
is what happened.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.359
Goddamn horse spooked
and the mules took off...

16:03.430 --> 16:05.364
and scattered food everywhere.

16:05.933 --> 16:09.699
Beans is about all we got left.
Got whiskey or somethin'?

16:15.209 --> 16:16.699
Dumb-ass mule.

16:21.615 --> 16:24.846
I can't believe that. God damn.

16:26.453 --> 16:28.046
Let me see.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.120
Shit.

16:35.662 --> 16:39.121
Well, we gotta do somethin'
about this food situation.

16:39.566 --> 16:42.001
Maybe I'll shoot
one of the sheep.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.737
Yeah, what if
Aguirre finds out, huh?

16:44.805 --> 16:46.773
We're supposed to guard
the sheep, not eat 'em.

16:46.840 --> 16:50.299
What's the matter with you?
There are a thousand of 'em.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.311
I'll stick with beans.

16:55.616 --> 16:57.106
Well, I won't.

17:10.998 --> 17:12.021
Yeah!

17:12.098 --> 17:14.727
Gettin' tired
of your dumb-ass missin'.

17:14.968 --> 17:16.402
Let's get a move on.

17:16.470 --> 17:19.439
Don't want the Game and Fish
to catch us with no elk.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.393
Come on. Shit.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.966
Yeah, I'm commutin'
four hours a day.

17:56.810 --> 17:59.905
I come in for breakfast,
I go back to the sheep.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.408
Evenin', get 'em bedded down.

18:02.482 --> 18:05.247
Come in for supper,
go back to the sheep.

18:06.286 --> 18:09.347
Spend half the night
checkin' for damn coyotes.

18:10.157 --> 18:12.785
Aguirre got no right
to make me do this.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.894
You wanna switch? I wouldn't
mind sleepin' out there.

18:17.965 --> 18:21.799
That ain't the point. The point is,
we both ought to be in this camp.

18:22.603 --> 18:25.731
Goddamn pup tent smells
like cat piss or worse.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.839
I wouldn't mind
bein' out there.

18:32.179 --> 18:34.511
Well, I'm happy
to switch with you...

18:34.581 --> 18:37.175
but I warn you,
I can't cook worth a damn.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.617
I am pretty good
with a can opener, though.

18:41.521 --> 18:44.013
You can't be no worse
than me, then.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.291
Here you go.

18:56.370 --> 18:58.736
You won't get much sleep,
I'll tell you that.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.535
Yup. Come on.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.228
Shot a coyote up there.

19:23.163 --> 19:26.861
It's a big son of a bitch. He had
balls on him the size of apples.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.702
He looked like
he could eat himself a camel.

19:32.205 --> 19:34.504
You want
some of this hot water?

19:38.211 --> 19:39.736
It's all yours.

20:18.919 --> 20:20.910
I don't rodeo much myself.

20:21.688 --> 20:22.849
I mean, what's the point...

20:22.923 --> 20:25.585
of ridin' some piece of stock
for eight seconds?

20:25.659 --> 20:28.685
Money's a good point.
True enough.

20:30.163 --> 20:32.860
If you don't get stomped
winnin' it, huh?

20:32.999 --> 20:34.092
Yeah.

20:35.869 --> 20:38.964
Well, my old man,
he was a bull rider.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.038
Thank you.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.005
Pretty well-known in his day.

20:45.412 --> 20:48.006
Though he kept his secrets
to himself.

20:49.416 --> 20:52.943
Never taught me a thing, never
once come to see me ride.

21:04.498 --> 21:07.194
Your brother and sister
do right by you?

21:07.834 --> 21:11.270
They did the best they could
after my folks was gone.

21:13.140 --> 21:15.973
Considerin' they didn't
leave us nothin'...

21:16.309 --> 21:18.403
but $24 in a coffee can.

21:19.980 --> 21:22.346
I got me a year of high school.

21:23.116 --> 21:26.313
That was before the transmission
went on the pickup.

21:29.089 --> 21:32.787
And then my sis left. She married
a roughneck, moved to Casper.

21:33.927 --> 21:35.656
And me and my brother...

21:35.729 --> 21:39.256
we went and got ourselves some
work on a ranch up near Worland.

21:39.332 --> 21:42.268
Till I was 10.
Then he got married.

21:44.905 --> 21:46.839
And no more room for me.

21:50.243 --> 21:53.873
That's how come me end up here.

22:04.057 --> 22:05.149
What?

22:06.960 --> 22:10.863
Man, that's more words than you've
spoke in the past two weeks.

22:11.731 --> 22:14.564
Hell, that's the most
I've spoke in a year.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.873
But my dad,
he was a fine roper.

22:23.977 --> 22:25.274
Didn't rodeo much, though.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.939
He thought rodeo cowboys
was all fuck-ups.

22:30.851 --> 22:32.512
The hell they are.

22:34.187 --> 22:35.416
Well...

22:41.328 --> 22:42.556
There you go.

22:44.364 --> 22:48.130
I'm spurrin' his guts out! Wavin'
to the girls in the stands!

22:48.201 --> 22:51.762
He's kickin' me to high heaven,
but he don't jackboard me! No!

22:55.976 --> 22:57.967
I think my dad was right.

23:43.189 --> 23:45.055
Tent don't look right.

23:45.759 --> 23:48.592
Well, it ain't
goin' nowhere. Let it be.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.999
That harmonica don't sound
quite right either.

23:53.066 --> 23:56.502
That's 'cause it got kind of
flattened when that mare threw me.

23:56.569 --> 23:58.162
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

23:58.772 --> 24:01.673
I thought you said
that mare couldn't throw you.

24:01.741 --> 24:03.232
She got lucky.

24:04.678 --> 24:08.205
Yeah, well, if I got lucky, that
harmonica would've broke in two.

24:11.685 --> 24:15.917
♪ I know I shall meet you
on that final day ♪

24:16.489 --> 24:21.484
♪ Water-walking Jesus,
take me away! ♫

24:23.163 --> 24:25.791
- Very good.
- Oh, yeah.

24:25.999 --> 24:29.094
My mama, she believes
in the Pentecost.

24:29.169 --> 24:30.432
Oh, yeah?

24:32.605 --> 24:34.574
What exactly is the Pentecost?

24:34.641 --> 24:37.406
I mean, my folks,
they was Methodist.

24:38.845 --> 24:40.336
The Pentecost.

24:40.647 --> 24:43.139
I don't know, I don't know
what the Pentecost is.

24:43.216 --> 24:47.676
Mom never explained it to me. I
guess it's when the world ends...

24:47.854 --> 24:50.915
and fellas like you and me,
we march off to hell.

24:52.092 --> 24:53.684
Speak for yourself.

24:53.760 --> 24:57.287
You may be a sinner, but I
ain't yet had the opportunity.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.231
Thank you.

25:04.104 --> 25:06.004
Shit!

25:07.907 --> 25:09.807
I'm gonna go up
to the sheep now.

25:09.876 --> 25:11.367
Give 'em hell.

25:17.484 --> 25:19.008
No, I'm...

25:21.154 --> 25:24.681
You can hardly stand. It's too
late to go to them sheep.

25:28.461 --> 25:30.452
Well, you got an extra blanket?

25:30.597 --> 25:34.431
I'll just roll up out here,
grab 40 winks...

25:34.834 --> 25:37.235
and I'll ride out
at first light.

25:41.274 --> 25:43.971
You'll freeze your ass off
when that fire dies down.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.341
Oh, that's good.

25:45.412 --> 25:47.380
You're better off
sleepin' in the tent.

25:47.447 --> 25:48.539
Yeah.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.548
All right.

26:27.954 --> 26:30.286
- Ennis!
- What?

26:30.924 --> 26:33.654
Just quit your yammerin'
and get in here!

27:34.988 --> 27:37.115
Come on, come on.

27:46.366 --> 27:48.095
What are you doin'?

29:55.094 --> 29:56.824
See you for supper.

29:58.231 --> 29:59.721
Yeah. Come on.

30:37.770 --> 30:39.033
Come on.

32:03.923 --> 32:06.756
This is a one-shot thing
we got goin' on here.

32:12.131 --> 32:14.430
It's nobody's business
but ours.

32:16.135 --> 32:18.035
You know I ain't queer.

32:19.105 --> 32:20.470
Me, neither.

33:35.314 --> 33:36.646
I'm sorry.

33:37.817 --> 33:39.341
It's all right.

33:41.554 --> 33:43.044
It's all right.

33:43.122 --> 33:45.181
Lie back. Come on.

34:48.353 --> 34:49.514
Twist.

34:50.156 --> 34:52.920
Your Uncle Harold's in
the hospital with pneumonia.

34:52.992 --> 34:55.290
Docs don't expect
he'll make it.

34:56.228 --> 34:59.323
Your ma sent me to tell you,
so here I am.

35:02.468 --> 35:03.731
Bad news.

35:05.571 --> 35:08.234
There ain't nothin' I can do
about it up here, I guess.

35:08.307 --> 35:11.868
There's not much you can do
about it down there, neither.

35:14.647 --> 35:17.082
Not unless you can
cure pneumonia.

35:50.149 --> 35:52.379
God damn! Jesus!

35:52.485 --> 35:55.352
Them sheep will drift if I don't
get back up there tonight!

35:55.421 --> 35:58.413
You'll get pitched off your
mount in a storm like this.

35:58.491 --> 36:00.789
You'll wish
you hadn't tried it!

36:01.560 --> 36:03.495
It's too cold! Close it up!

36:13.272 --> 36:15.798
What are we
supposed to do now, huh?

36:15.941 --> 36:20.174
Get on in there and untangle 'em
Chilean sheep out of ours, I guess.

36:22.048 --> 36:23.709
Oh, where is it? Shit!

36:27.953 --> 36:31.116
God, half the goddamn
paint brands have wore off!

36:32.091 --> 36:36.323
We gotta try. The least we can do
is get the count right for Aguirre.

36:36.395 --> 36:39.194
Fuck Aguirre!
Oh, yeah, fuck Aguirre.

36:39.331 --> 36:42.199
What if we need to work for him again?
You think of that?

36:42.268 --> 36:44.498
We gotta stick this out, Jack.

37:00.352 --> 37:03.880
You'll run them sheep off again
if you don't quiet down.

37:40.359 --> 37:42.089
What are you doing?

37:43.362 --> 37:45.228
Aguirre came by again.

37:45.731 --> 37:48.200
Says my uncle didn't die
after all.

37:48.901 --> 37:50.596
Says bring 'em down.

37:50.669 --> 37:53.764
Bring 'em down, why?
It's the middle of August.

37:54.039 --> 37:57.202
Says there's a storm comin',
movin' in from the Pacific.

37:57.276 --> 37:59.040
Worse than this one.

37:59.745 --> 38:03.045
That snow barely stuck an hour.

38:04.817 --> 38:08.685
Besides, that son of a bitch, he's
cuttin' us out a whole month's pay.

38:08.754 --> 38:10.154
It ain't right.

38:12.358 --> 38:13.587
Well...

38:13.959 --> 38:16.553
I can spare you a loan, bud,
if you're short on cash.

38:16.629 --> 38:18.495
Give it to you
when we get to Signal.

38:18.564 --> 38:20.555
I don't need your money, huh?

38:20.933 --> 38:24.062
You know, I ain't in
the poorhouse. Shit!

38:25.804 --> 38:27.136
All right.

39:00.239 --> 39:02.264
Time to get goin', cowboy.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.816
Come here!
This ain't no rodeo, cowboy!

39:18.891 --> 39:20.188
Oh, shit!

39:46.852 --> 39:48.877
Ennis. Ennis.

39:52.458 --> 39:54.620
Come here. You okay?

39:55.361 --> 39:56.851
- You okay?
- Yeah.

40:46.712 --> 40:49.545
Some of these never went
up there with you.

40:52.551 --> 40:55.214
Count ain't what
I'd hoped for, neither.

40:56.121 --> 40:59.421
You ranch stiffs,
you ain't never no good.

41:14.540 --> 41:16.440
Wanna give it some gas?

41:25.484 --> 41:28.476
I can't believe I left
my damn shirt up there.

41:30.589 --> 41:31.681
Yeah.

41:34.493 --> 41:36.587
You gonna do this again
next summer?

41:36.662 --> 41:38.027
Well, maybe not.

41:38.764 --> 41:42.200
Like I said, me and Alma is
gettin' married in November.

41:42.267 --> 41:43.394
So...

41:44.236 --> 41:46.967
I'll try to get somethin'
on a ranch, I guess.

41:48.073 --> 41:49.302
And you?

41:50.876 --> 41:55.211
Might go up to my daddy's place and
give him a hand through the winter.

41:56.782 --> 41:58.375
I might be back.

41:59.218 --> 42:01.209
If the Army don't get me.

42:07.126 --> 42:09.526
Well, I guess
I'll see you around, huh?

42:10.562 --> 42:11.723
Right.

43:22.367 --> 43:25.428
What the fuck
are you lookin' at?

43:34.079 --> 43:35.672
"And forgive us
our trespasses..."

43:35.747 --> 43:38.512
"as we forgive those
who trespass against us."

43:38.584 --> 43:42.020
"Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil."

43:42.120 --> 43:46.421
"For thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory, forever. Amen."

43:47.893 --> 43:49.759
Under the powers
vested in me...

43:49.828 --> 43:52.422
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

43:53.365 --> 43:56.733
You may kiss the bride.
And if you don't, I will.

44:15.053 --> 44:17.022
- You all right?
- No.

44:21.093 --> 44:22.185
Stop!

44:23.395 --> 44:24.726
No, please don't!

44:30.669 --> 44:33.331
My old lady's tryin' to
get me to quit this job.

44:33.405 --> 44:37.205
She says I'm gettin' too old to be
breakin' my back shovelin' asphalt.

44:37.276 --> 44:40.973
I told her strong backs and
weak minds runs in the family.

44:41.580 --> 44:44.049
She didn't think
that was too funny.

44:44.116 --> 44:46.209
I told her it keeps me fit.

44:49.121 --> 44:51.487
- Mornin'.
- Mornin'.

44:53.025 --> 44:56.791
Pulled in last night.
Didn't want to wake you up.

44:57.029 --> 44:58.860
Oh, no, I was just...

45:00.632 --> 45:02.931
I thought I'd tell you before
the Sergeant showed up.

45:03.001 --> 45:05.265
Parking this trailer
on the beach is illegal.

45:24.423 --> 45:25.515
Yeah!

45:31.863 --> 45:33.957
Well,
look what the wind blew in.

45:34.733 --> 45:36.258
Hi, Mr. Aguirre.

45:36.335 --> 45:39.463
I was wonderin' if you was
needin' any help this summer.

45:39.538 --> 45:41.768
You're wastin' your time here.

45:42.908 --> 45:45.035
What, you ain't got nothin'?

45:46.678 --> 45:48.647
Nothin' up on Brokeback?

45:50.515 --> 45:52.643
I ain't got no work for you.

46:01.260 --> 46:03.990
Ennis Del Mar
ain't been around, has he?

46:07.165 --> 46:10.727
You boys sure found a way to
make the time pass up there.

46:13.005 --> 46:14.199
Twist...

46:14.673 --> 46:17.643
you guys wasn't gettin' paid to leave
the dogs baby-sit the sheep...

46:17.709 --> 46:19.803
while you stemmed the rose.

46:25.417 --> 46:27.943
Now get the hell
out of my trailer.

46:57.049 --> 46:59.518
[man chattering on TV)

47:13.832 --> 47:15.561
How my girls doing?

47:16.835 --> 47:19.736
All right. Jenny's still
got a runny nose.

47:43.061 --> 47:45.655
Ennis, could you wipe
Alma Jr.'s nose?

47:46.131 --> 47:48.361
If I had three hands, I could.

47:49.735 --> 47:51.703
Come here. Come here. Oh!

48:19.664 --> 48:20.927
Girls all right?

48:20.999 --> 48:24.765
Yeah.
Jenny stopped her coughin'.

48:26.571 --> 48:28.938
I think I should take the
girls into town this weekend.

48:29.007 --> 48:32.443
Get 'em an ice cream.
Somethin'.

48:36.681 --> 48:38.547
Can't we move to town?

48:40.452 --> 48:43.148
I'm tired of these
lonesome old ranches.

48:44.256 --> 48:47.316
No one's around
for Junior to play with.

48:47.626 --> 48:49.287
Besides,
I'm scared for Jenny...

48:49.361 --> 48:52.194
scared if she has another one
of 'em bad asthma spells.

48:52.264 --> 48:54.460
No, rent in town is too high.

48:58.103 --> 49:01.562
There's a cheap place in
Riverton, over the Laundromat.

49:02.140 --> 49:04.575
I bet I could
fix it up real nice.

49:04.810 --> 49:08.041
I bet you could fix this place
up real nice if you wanted to.

49:08.113 --> 49:09.512
Ennis.

49:10.515 --> 49:12.882
I know you'd like it, too.

49:14.419 --> 49:18.515
Real home, other kids
for the girls to play with.

49:21.726 --> 49:24.218
Not so lonely
like you were raised.

49:25.630 --> 49:28.429
You don't want 'em
to be so lonely, do you?

49:32.671 --> 49:33.865
Yeah.

49:36.274 --> 49:37.606
Come here.

49:43.381 --> 49:45.611
It ain't so lonely now, is it?

49:50.689 --> 49:53.488
- Are you sure the girls are asleep?
- Yeah.

50:06.438 --> 50:07.769
Come here.

50:19.751 --> 50:20.912
Ennis.

50:23.421 --> 50:25.583
Let 'er rip and snort, boys!

50:25.657 --> 50:28.183
Jack Twist,
hangin' on for dear life!

50:28.526 --> 50:32.361
And down he goes!
Watch out there, fella!

50:32.430 --> 50:35.161
He's comin' for you.
Send in the clowns!

50:36.167 --> 50:38.898
- Okay, a fine ride by Mr. Twist.
- Shit!

50:38.970 --> 50:40.495
Four seconds for him.

50:41.506 --> 50:45.204
Give 'em a hand, folks,
our very own rodeo clowns!

50:48.647 --> 50:50.171
Give us a beer, Doug.

51:03.495 --> 51:05.930
I'd like to buy
Jimbo here a beer.

51:07.766 --> 51:10.667
Best damn rodeo clown
I've ever worked with.

51:13.071 --> 51:14.436
No thanks, cowboy.

51:14.506 --> 51:16.872
If I was to let every rodeo
hand I pulled a bull off of...

51:16.942 --> 51:19.843
buy me liquor, I'd have
been a alcoholic long ago.

51:26.151 --> 51:29.348
Pullin' bulls off of you
buckaroos is just my job.

51:29.688 --> 51:32.953
So save your money for
your next entry fee, cowboy.

51:48.306 --> 51:50.297
You ever try calf ropin'?

51:54.679 --> 51:57.945
Do I look like I can afford
a fuckin' ropin' horse?

52:14.032 --> 52:15.761
Shouldn't we move
a little closer?

52:15.834 --> 52:19.566
No. Come on, let's don't.
Jenny'll get scared.

52:24.676 --> 52:26.439
Look at this crowd!

52:26.845 --> 52:30.281
Bound to be a lot of pussy on
the hoof in a crowd like this.

52:30.348 --> 52:32.282
All swelled up
with patriotic feeling...

52:32.350 --> 52:34.114
and ready to be
humped like a frog.

52:34.185 --> 52:36.654
So, where do you figure
the most pussy is at?

52:36.721 --> 52:38.382
Las Vegas or California?

52:38.456 --> 52:39.685
Hell, I don't know...

52:39.758 --> 52:42.693
but if you make it between Montana
and Wyoming, I'd take Wyoming...

52:42.761 --> 52:46.595
Hey! You might want to keep it
down, I got two little girls here.

52:46.665 --> 52:49.634
Fuck you. Asshole.

52:50.101 --> 52:53.230
Probably quit givin' it to his
wife after his kids was born.

52:53.304 --> 52:55.773
- You know what that's like.
- Yeah.

52:58.543 --> 53:01.274
Ennis, let's move.
Let's just move, okay?

53:05.450 --> 53:07.077
Now, I don't want
any trouble from you.

53:07.152 --> 53:09.279
You need to shut your slop-bucket
mouths, you hear me?

53:09.354 --> 53:11.117
You ought to listen
to your old lady, then.

53:11.189 --> 53:14.022
- Is that right?
- Yeah. Move somewhere else.

53:15.427 --> 53:18.760
What about it? You wanna lose about
half your fuckin' teeth, huh?

53:18.830 --> 53:21.424
Not tonight, bud.
I'd sure rather not.

53:31.509 --> 53:33.705
Here she comes,
ladies and gentlemen!

53:33.778 --> 53:35.712
Oh, boy, look at her fly!

53:35.780 --> 53:38.716
This is Lureen Newsome from
right here in Childress, Texas!

53:38.783 --> 53:41.980
Come on, folks, she's gotta hear
it, let's give her a big hand!

53:42.053 --> 53:43.578
She's turnin' on two!

53:44.856 --> 53:46.483
She's around three!

53:46.558 --> 53:49.322
Come on, folks! Help her home!

53:49.394 --> 53:51.829
Come on! Come on!

53:51.896 --> 53:55.731
And the time is 16 and 9!

53:59.270 --> 54:03.639
Here's Cheyenne Hodson
from Cody, Wyoming!

54:04.843 --> 54:06.333
Come on, girl!

54:08.713 --> 54:10.681
She's headed around two!

54:10.849 --> 54:13.511
- Is there anybody here from Wyoming?
- Ma'am.

54:13.585 --> 54:15.314
How about it, folks?

54:18.289 --> 54:20.280
Come on, Cheyenne!

54:20.358 --> 54:24.227
And her time is 17 and 2!

54:26.664 --> 54:29.224
Here comes Scotty Gri·iths,
out of Lubbock, Texas.

54:29.300 --> 54:30.859
Come on, Scotty!

54:31.002 --> 54:34.370
Let's give Scotty Griths
a big hand, folks.

54:34.606 --> 54:36.574
Better luck next time, cowboy.

54:36.641 --> 54:39.702
Boy, I tell you, folks, what a
heck of a way to make a living!

54:39.778 --> 54:41.746
Next up is an up-and-comer!

54:41.846 --> 54:46.750
Jack Twist from all the way up
in Lightning Flat, Wyoming.

54:47.018 --> 54:51.455
He's on board Sleepy today!
Let's hope he's not!

54:51.623 --> 54:52.613
Okay!

54:52.790 --> 54:56.852
There they go, folks!
And look at Sleepy go, boy!

54:56.928 --> 55:01.559
He's broke free today, folks!
Come on, spin and spin and spin!

55:02.033 --> 55:06.937
Oh, boy! Good ride, cowboy! Well,
let's see what the judges say!

55:07.138 --> 55:11.041
I tell you, folks, that sure looked
like the winnin' ride to me!

55:29.594 --> 55:31.323
You know that girl?

55:32.163 --> 55:34.223
I sure do. Lureen Newsome.

55:34.632 --> 55:37.795
Her dad sells farm equipment.
I mean, big farm equipment.

55:37.869 --> 55:40.668
$100,000 tractors,
shit like that.

55:54.319 --> 55:57.413
What are you waitin' for,
cowboy? A matin' call?

56:02.193 --> 56:05.925
♪ No one's gonna love you
like me ♪

56:07.432 --> 56:11.835

57:37.088 --> 57:39.614
You don't think
I'm too fast, do you?

57:39.924 --> 57:42.359
Maybe we should
put the brakes on?

57:42.994 --> 57:46.328
Fast or slow, I just like
the direction you're goin'.

57:56.841 --> 57:59.674
You are in a hurry.
My daddy's the hurry.

57:59.744 --> 58:02.475
He expects me home
with the car by midnight.

58:13.124 --> 58:15.149
Come here, come here.

58:16.594 --> 58:17.823
- Hi, Monroe.
- Hey, Ennis.

58:17.895 --> 58:18.885
Is Alma here?

58:18.963 --> 58:20.328
Yeah, she's in
the condiments aisle.

58:20.398 --> 58:22.161
- The what?
- Ketchup.

58:22.567 --> 58:23.761
Thanks.

58:24.168 --> 58:25.659
Your boy gonna play
again this year?

58:25.737 --> 58:27.227
- Excuse us!
- Yeah, excuse me.

58:27.305 --> 58:30.001
Hey, honey. Honey,
what are y'all doing here?

58:30.308 --> 58:31.366
Big hurry.

58:31.442 --> 58:34.378
My boss called and, well, he
wants me to go up to the ranch.

58:34.445 --> 58:35.435
Mama.

58:35.513 --> 58:37.106
I guess all the heifers
must've decided...

58:37.181 --> 58:38.706
to calve at the same time.

58:38.783 --> 58:40.751
I figured I could
drop the girls off with you.

58:40.818 --> 58:42.252
Ennis, well...

58:42.320 --> 58:44.948
I got a million things I gotta
do here before I can leave.

58:45.023 --> 58:46.581
I don't get off
for another three hours.

58:46.657 --> 58:49.627
Mama, I need crayons.
Not now, Alma.

58:50.027 --> 58:52.622
Ennis, please, you promised
you'd take them tonight.

58:52.697 --> 58:55.462
Alma, I can't afford not to be
there when the heifers calve.

58:55.533 --> 58:57.501
Right, it'd be my job
if I lose any of 'em.

58:57.568 --> 58:59.230
What about my job?

59:03.041 --> 59:04.906
Okay, all right,
I'll call my sister.

59:04.976 --> 59:07.376
I'll see if she can take 'em.
All right. All right.

59:07.445 --> 59:09.573
You be a good girl
for your mama, all right?

59:09.647 --> 59:10.978
I'll be half the night.

59:11.048 --> 59:12.983
Bring home some ground steaks
if you think of it.

59:13.050 --> 59:16.418
Come here. Oh, Alma, please!

59:19.757 --> 59:20.986
Oh, boy.

59:21.726 --> 59:23.524
- Okay.
- Monroe, I'm so sorry.

59:23.594 --> 59:25.688
It's okay. It's okay, Alma.

59:25.963 --> 59:28.330
I'll clean this up just as
soon as I call my sister...

59:28.399 --> 59:29.526
to come get the girls.

59:29.600 --> 59:32.001
Really, Alma, it's okay.
I'll get it.

59:32.070 --> 59:34.664
Alma, come with me.
Watch your feet.

59:34.872 --> 59:35.965
Alma.

59:37.608 --> 59:38.940
It's just like my hand.

59:39.010 --> 59:41.172
Honey, got a surprise for you.

59:41.646 --> 59:42.806
Hey.

59:44.916 --> 59:47.646
I got two whole boxes
of formula for you.

59:47.718 --> 59:48.742
You did?

59:48.820 --> 59:51.789
- 120 cans.
- 120?

59:51.856 --> 59:53.346
L.D., where did you put 'em?

59:53.424 --> 59:56.360
Oh, hell, back seat of the
car, where I left 'em.

59:58.429 --> 01:00:00.159
Rodeo can get 'em.

01:00:02.934 --> 01:00:06.836
L.D., I can already see
who little Bobby looks like.

01:00:06.938 --> 01:00:08.098
Good job, little girl.

01:00:08.172 --> 01:00:10.800
He's the spittin' image
of his grandpa.

01:00:11.776 --> 01:00:14.871
Isn't he just the spittin'
image of his grandpa?

01:00:17.548 --> 01:00:18.606
Yeah.

01:00:21.419 --> 01:00:23.216
Look at those eyes.

01:00:48.913 --> 01:00:49.971
Hey.

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:54.015
Hey, honey.

01:00:58.089 --> 01:01:00.819
Hey, Ennis, you know
somebody, name of Jack?

01:01:04.095 --> 01:01:05.460
Maybe. Why?

01:01:05.596 --> 01:01:08.498
'Cause you got a postcard.
It come general delivery.

01:01:20.878 --> 01:01:23.677
Is he somebody
you cowboyed with, or what?

01:01:24.682 --> 01:01:26.776
No, Jack, he rodeos, mostly.

01:01:29.954 --> 01:01:31.854
We was fishin' buddies.

01:02:10.561 --> 01:02:12.495
You can color that one, too.

01:02:12.563 --> 01:02:14.554
I'll color the beach.

01:02:21.005 --> 01:02:23.906
Maybe we could
get a baby-sitter.

01:02:25.876 --> 01:02:27.936
Take your friend
to the Knife and Fork?

01:02:28.012 --> 01:02:30.504
No, Jack ain't
the restaurant type.

01:02:31.282 --> 01:02:34.183
We'll more likely
just go out and get drunk.

01:02:35.586 --> 01:02:37.316
That's if he shows.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.795
Okay, we take one more bite, and
then you're finished with dinner.

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:50.799
There, that's a good bite.
All right, you're excused.

01:02:51.135 --> 01:02:52.796
Please. Thank you.

01:03:13.424 --> 01:03:15.153
Jack fuckin' Twist.

01:03:19.864 --> 01:03:21.388
Son of a bitch.

01:03:27.238 --> 01:03:28.398
Come here.

01:04:29.066 --> 01:04:31.831
Alma, this is Jack Twist.

01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:34.404
And, Jack,
this is my wife, Alma.

01:04:34.472 --> 01:04:36.064
- Howdy.
- Hello.

01:04:38.175 --> 01:04:39.336
You got a kid.

01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:42.436
Yeah, I got two little girls.
Alma Jr. and Jenny.

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:44.710
- I got a boy.
- Yeah?

01:04:45.316 --> 01:04:47.842
Eight months old. Smiles a lot.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:51.550
I married the prettiest little
gal in Childress, Texas.

01:04:51.622 --> 01:04:53.147
- Yeah?
- Lureen.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:59.658
So me and Jack, we're gonna head out
and get ourselves a drink. Yeah?

01:05:00.431 --> 01:05:02.900
Sure enough.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

01:05:03.334 --> 01:05:04.665
We might not
get back tonight...

01:05:04.735 --> 01:05:06.931
when we get to drinkin'
and talkin' and all.

01:05:07.004 --> 01:05:08.130
Ennis?

01:05:09.073 --> 01:05:10.541
Would you get me
a pack of smokes?

01:05:10.608 --> 01:05:13.509
If you need smokes, Alma, they're
in the top pocket of my blue shirt.

01:05:13.577 --> 01:05:15.204
There in the bedroom.

01:05:26.824 --> 01:05:30.317
Four years. Damn!
Yeah, four years.

01:05:33.564 --> 01:05:35.760
Didn't think
I'd hear from you again.

01:05:36.667 --> 01:05:39.364
I figured you were sore
from that punch.

01:05:40.204 --> 01:05:43.139
Right next summer,
I drove back up to Brokeback.

01:05:43.207 --> 01:05:45.335
Talked to Aguirre
about a job, and...

01:05:45.409 --> 01:05:48.072
He told me you hadn't
been back, so I left.

01:05:48.746 --> 01:05:51.806
Went down to Texas
for rodeoin'.

01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:54.718
That's how I met Lureen.

01:05:55.586 --> 01:05:58.749
Made $2,000 that year,
bull ridin'. Nearly starved.

01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:04.193
Lureen's old man makes serious
money, farm machine business.

01:06:04.261 --> 01:06:06.355
Of course, he hates my guts.

01:06:10.768 --> 01:06:13.931
And the Army didn't get you?
No, too busted up.

01:06:14.138 --> 01:06:16.436
And rodeoin' ain't what
it was in my daddy's day.

01:06:16.507 --> 01:06:18.908
Got out
while I could still walk.

01:06:21.011 --> 01:06:24.971
Swear to God, I didn't know we was
goin' to get into this again.

01:06:27.718 --> 01:06:29.709
Yes I did.
I red-lined it all the way.

01:06:29.787 --> 01:06:31.812
I couldn't get here
fast enough.

01:06:32.490 --> 01:06:36.051
What about you?
Me? I don't know.

01:06:39.897 --> 01:06:41.365
I don't know.

01:06:46.871 --> 01:06:49.396
Old Brokeback got us good,
don't it?

01:06:54.879 --> 01:06:57.006
What are we gonna do now?

01:07:00.885 --> 01:07:03.319
I doubt there's nothin'
we can do.

01:07:07.825 --> 01:07:10.123
So now I'm stuck
with what I got here.

01:07:14.765 --> 01:07:17.860
Makin' a livin' is
about all I got time for now.

01:07:41.892 --> 01:07:42.950
Hey.

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:46.059
Well, me and Jack is headed up
the mountain for a day or two.

01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:48.360
Do ourselves a little fishin'.

01:07:55.539 --> 01:07:59.066
You know, your friend could come
inside, have a cup of coffee.

01:07:59.243 --> 01:08:00.870
Well, he's from Texas.

01:08:01.912 --> 01:08:03.972
Texans don't drink coffee?

01:08:13.557 --> 01:08:15.719
You sure that foreman won't
fire you for takin' off?

01:08:15.793 --> 01:08:17.727
You know, that foreman,
he owes me.

01:08:17.795 --> 01:08:21.629
I worked through a blizzard last Christmas.
You remember that?

01:08:21.932 --> 01:08:24.560
Besides, I'll only be
a couple of days.

01:08:27.971 --> 01:08:30.167
Bring fish, Daddy.
A big, big one!

01:08:37.247 --> 01:08:38.977
Come here. Come here.

01:08:45.089 --> 01:08:46.420
Come here.

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:51.560
See you Sunday, latest.

01:09:02.006 --> 01:09:03.871
I'm starvin'. Want to
get somethin' to eat?

01:09:03.941 --> 01:09:04.965
Yup.

01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:34.738
Last one in!

01:09:53.524 --> 01:09:56.687
Is there anything interestin'
up there in heaven?

01:09:56.927 --> 01:09:59.658
Well, I was just sending up
a prayer of thanks.

01:10:00.330 --> 01:10:01.593
For what?

01:10:03.467 --> 01:10:06.232
For you forgettin'
to bring that harmonica.

01:10:06.303 --> 01:10:08.704
I'm enjoying
the peace and quiet.

01:10:12.943 --> 01:10:16.436
You know it could be like
this, just like this, always.

01:10:17.314 --> 01:10:19.510
Yeah? How do you figure that?

01:10:23.253 --> 01:10:26.519
What if you and me had
a little ranch somewhere...

01:10:27.991 --> 01:10:31.428
a little cow-and-calf operation?
It'd be a sweet life.

01:10:31.662 --> 01:10:33.596
I mean, hell,
Lureen's old man...

01:10:33.664 --> 01:10:35.757
you bet he'd give me
a down payment to get lost.

01:10:35.833 --> 01:10:38.529
I mean, he more or less
already said it.

01:10:39.870 --> 01:10:41.099
No, I...

01:10:43.107 --> 01:10:46.099
I told you
it ain't gonna be that way.

01:10:49.113 --> 01:10:50.478
You know...

01:10:51.315 --> 01:10:54.375
you got your wife
and baby in Texas.

01:10:55.652 --> 01:10:58.178
You know,
I got my life in Riverton.

01:10:58.956 --> 01:11:00.219
Is that so?

01:11:01.558 --> 01:11:04.494
You and Alma, that's a life?
Now you shut up about Alma.

01:11:04.561 --> 01:11:06.359
This ain't her fault.

01:11:08.632 --> 01:11:10.464
The bottom line is...

01:11:11.602 --> 01:11:13.627
we're around each other...

01:11:14.004 --> 01:11:16.701
and this thing grabs hold
of us again...

01:11:17.608 --> 01:11:19.405
in the wrong place...

01:11:20.210 --> 01:11:21.974
in the wrong time...

01:11:22.646 --> 01:11:24.171
and we're dead.

01:11:26.617 --> 01:11:28.084
I tell you...

01:11:28.152 --> 01:11:32.054
there were these two old guys
ranched up together down home.

01:11:34.024 --> 01:11:35.515
Earl and Rich.

01:11:37.261 --> 01:11:38.728
And they was a joke in town...

01:11:38.795 --> 01:11:41.629
even though they were
pretty tough old birds.

01:11:46.937 --> 01:11:49.565
Anyway, they found Earl dead...

01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:52.708
in an irrigation ditch.

01:11:54.311 --> 01:11:57.246
They took a tire iron to him,
spurred him up...

01:11:57.381 --> 01:12:00.475
and drug him around by
his dick till it pulled off.

01:12:02.452 --> 01:12:06.947
- You seen this?
- Yeah, I was what? Nine years old.

01:12:09.293 --> 01:12:12.456
My daddy, he made sure
me and my brother seen it.

01:12:16.967 --> 01:12:19.561
Hell, for all I know,
he done the job.

01:12:23.073 --> 01:12:25.474
Two guys living together?
No way.

01:12:27.611 --> 01:12:29.875
Now, we can get together
once in a while...

01:12:29.947 --> 01:12:33.144
way the hell out in the
middle of nowhere, but...

01:12:33.884 --> 01:12:35.579
"Once in a while."

01:12:36.854 --> 01:12:38.845
Every four fucking years?

01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:43.149
Well, if you can't fix it,
Jack, you gotta stand it.

01:12:46.597 --> 01:12:48.064
For how long?

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.494
As long as we can ride it.

01:12:57.541 --> 01:12:59.942
There ain't no reins
on this one.

01:13:16.493 --> 01:13:17.619
It's nearly suppertime.

01:13:17.694 --> 01:13:18.752
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

01:13:18.829 --> 01:13:19.921
To work!

01:13:19.997 --> 01:13:22.397
I thought you had the day off!
Well, you thought wrong!

01:13:22.466 --> 01:13:24.866
The girls need to be fed.
Well, you take care of it!

01:13:24.935 --> 01:13:27.165
Alma! Alma!

01:13:27.938 --> 01:13:29.303
Supper's on the stove!

01:13:29.373 --> 01:13:31.341
No one's eatin'
unless you're servin' it!

01:13:31.408 --> 01:13:33.570
I already promised
I'd take the extra shift!

01:13:33.644 --> 01:13:36.135
Fucking tell 'em
you made a mistake, then!

01:13:36.213 --> 01:13:38.579
God damn it, Alma! Alma!

01:13:48.759 --> 01:13:50.556
You girls need
a push or somethin'?

01:13:50.627 --> 01:13:51.719
No.

01:14:00.971 --> 01:14:02.962
Listen to her purr, gentlemen!

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:05.440
You ain't gonna get that
with your Caddy!

01:14:05.575 --> 01:14:08.602
I told you what she could do,
and now let me show you.

01:14:11.214 --> 01:14:14.548
Say, didn't that pissant
used to ride the bulls?

01:14:16.987 --> 01:14:18.511
He used to try.

01:14:51.388 --> 01:14:54.187
Honey, have you seen
my blue parka?

01:14:55.025 --> 01:14:56.584
Last time I seen it,
you was in it...

01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:58.822
day we had that big ice storm.

01:15:00.130 --> 01:15:02.758
Well, could have sworn
I seen it in here.

01:15:04.301 --> 01:15:05.666
You know...

01:15:06.636 --> 01:15:08.730
you've been going up
to Wyoming all these years.

01:15:08.805 --> 01:15:11.638
Why can't your buddy come
down here to Texas and fish?

01:15:11.708 --> 01:15:14.336
Because the Bighorn Mountains
ain't in Texas.

01:15:14.478 --> 01:15:17.470
And I don't think that his pickup
could make it down here, anyway.

01:15:17.547 --> 01:15:20.244
New model comin' in this week,
remember?

01:15:20.851 --> 01:15:23.650
You're the best
combine salesman we got.

01:15:24.321 --> 01:15:26.016
You're the only
combine salesman, in fact.

01:15:26.089 --> 01:15:29.025
Yeah, I'll be back in a week. That
is, unless I freeze to death...

01:15:29.092 --> 01:15:30.719
and I'll freeze
if I don't find that parka.

01:15:30.794 --> 01:15:32.922
Well, I don't have
your goddamn parka.

01:15:32.996 --> 01:15:35.863
You know, you're worse than Bobby
when it comes to losin' stuff.

01:15:35.932 --> 01:15:37.958
Well, speakin' of Bobby,
did you call his school...

01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:40.060
about gettin' him a tutor?

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:41.968
I thought you were gonna call.

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:44.667
- I complain too much. That teacher don't like me.
- Right.

01:15:44.741 --> 01:15:48.109
- Now it's your turn.
- Okay, fine, so I'll call later.

01:15:50.981 --> 01:15:52.107
Right. Fine.

01:15:53.583 --> 01:15:54.642
Goodbye.

01:15:55.652 --> 01:15:57.882
Got 14 hours of
driving ahead of me.

Our husbands ain't the least
bit interested in dancin'.

01:34:53.055 --> 01:34:55.183
They ain't got a smidgen
of rhythm between them.

01:34:55.257 --> 01:34:56.315
It's funny, isn't it?

01:34:56.392 --> 01:35:00.829
Husbands don't never seem to
wanna dance with their wives.

01:35:01.797 --> 01:35:03.629
Why do you think that is, Jack?

01:35:03.699 --> 01:35:06.168
I don't know,
I never give it any thought.

01:35:07.069 --> 01:35:08.469
Wanna dance?

01:35:09.872 --> 01:35:12.341
- Yes, thank you.
- Do you mind?

01:35:12.408 --> 01:35:15.275
No, it's all right. Go ahead.
All right.

01:35:16.312 --> 01:35:17.540
Pardon us.

01:35:17.613 --> 01:35:19.411
Thank you for asking me
to dance with you.

01:35:19.481 --> 01:35:21.643
I really appreciate that.
Randall never does.

01:35:21.717 --> 01:35:23.515
Last time I did,
I think it was our wedding.

01:35:23.586 --> 01:35:25.952
It's a good thing you and Lureen
happened along when you did...

01:35:26.021 --> 01:35:28.149
or else we'd still be stuck
on the side of the road...

01:35:28.224 --> 01:35:29.486
in that darn pickup.

01:35:29.558 --> 01:35:31.049
I told Randall
we ought to take the car.

01:35:31.126 --> 01:35:32.651
Of course,
he'd never listen to me.

01:35:32.728 --> 01:35:35.720
He wouldn't listen to me
if he was goin' deaf tomorrow.

01:35:35.798 --> 01:35:38.858
I told him it'd take more than
chewing gum and baling wire...

01:35:38.934 --> 01:35:40.493
to fix that pickup.

01:35:40.569 --> 01:35:42.697
Well, he's never been
very mechanical, though.

01:35:45.574 --> 01:35:47.440
Come over here and ask...

01:35:54.216 --> 01:35:56.344
You ever notice how a woman
will powder her nose...

01:35:56.418 --> 01:35:58.353
before she goes to a party?

01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:01.856
And then she'll powder it
again once the party's over.

01:36:02.157 --> 01:36:05.650
I mean, why powder your nose
just to go home and go to bed?

01:36:05.728 --> 01:36:07.059
Don't know.

01:36:07.896 --> 01:36:09.262
Even if I wanted to know...

01:36:09.331 --> 01:36:12.597
I couldn't get a word in with
Lashawn long enough to ask.

01:36:12.668 --> 01:36:16.002
Woman talks a blue streak.
Lively little gal.

01:36:23.946 --> 01:36:26.039
You'll like working
for Roy Taylor.

01:36:26.115 --> 01:36:29.312
- He's solid, Roy.
- Yeah, Roy. He's a good old boy.

01:36:34.723 --> 01:36:37.556
He's got a little cabin
down on Lake Kemp.

01:36:38.894 --> 01:36:41.295
Got a crappie house,
little boat.

01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:44.356
Said I could use it
whenever I want.

01:36:48.103 --> 01:36:50.732
We ought to go down there
some weekend.

01:36:51.573 --> 01:36:54.008
Drink a little whiskey,
fish some.

01:36:55.411 --> 01:36:57.675
Get away, you know?

01:37:00.883 --> 01:37:02.373
That was right out of SMU.

01:37:02.451 --> 01:37:04.920
I could've had my pick of pretty
much any job in North Dallas.

01:37:04.987 --> 01:37:07.353
So my pick was Neiman Marcus,
which was a disaster...

01:37:07.423 --> 01:37:10.517
because, honey, where clothes is
concerned, I got no resistance.

01:37:10.592 --> 01:37:13.858
I was spending more than I made.
More than Randall ever will make.

01:37:13.929 --> 01:37:14.919
We come out here...

01:37:14.997 --> 01:37:17.090
thinkin' that ranchin' was
still big hats and Marlboros.

01:37:17.166 --> 01:37:19.100
Boy, were we behind the times.

01:37:35.718 --> 01:37:37.913
Hey there, Junior. You ready?

01:37:53.168 --> 01:37:54.898
What do you think?

01:37:55.738 --> 01:37:59.037
Your daddy ever gonna see
fit to settle down again?

01:38:00.375 --> 01:38:03.743
Don't know. Maybe he's not
the marrying kind.

01:38:06.715 --> 01:38:08.445
You don't think so?

01:38:09.118 --> 01:38:11.746
Or you don't think
I'm the one for him?

01:38:14.523 --> 01:38:16.252
You're good enough.

01:38:21.330 --> 01:38:24.527
You don't say much,
but you get your point across.

01:38:26.702 --> 01:38:29.034
Sorry.
I didn't mean to be rude.

01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:33.033
All right.

01:38:33.876 --> 01:38:36.402
You're stayin'
on your feet, cowboy.

01:38:37.513 --> 01:38:39.003
Excuse me, darling.

01:39:01.904 --> 01:39:05.567
So I'll pick you and Jenny up
next weekend, after church.

01:39:07.042 --> 01:39:08.134
Fine.

01:39:11.814 --> 01:39:13.304
You all right?

01:39:14.616 --> 01:39:15.674
Yes.

01:39:16.885 --> 01:39:18.353
Are you sure?

01:39:21.623 --> 01:39:24.786
Daddy, I was thinking, what
with the new baby and all...

01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:27.261
Ma and Monroe have been
awful strict on me.

01:39:27.329 --> 01:39:29.423
More on me than Jenny even.

01:39:30.332 --> 01:39:32.664
I was thinkin',
maybe I could...

01:39:34.837 --> 01:39:37.237
Maybe I could come
stay with you.

01:39:38.407 --> 01:39:41.240
I'd be an awful good help,
I know I would.

01:39:41.677 --> 01:39:44.669
Now, you know
I ain't set up for that.

01:39:46.515 --> 01:39:48.643
With the roundup comin'...

01:39:49.318 --> 01:39:51.115
I won't ever be home.

01:39:52.621 --> 01:39:54.487
It's all right, Daddy.

01:39:54.756 --> 01:39:58.716
I'm not sayin' that I wouldn't...
It's all right, I understand.

01:40:01.096 --> 01:40:03.326
Well, see you on Sunday, then.

01:40:04.299 --> 01:40:05.357
Bye.

01:40:07.903 --> 01:40:09.496
Bye, sweetheart.

01:40:39.034 --> 01:40:41.332
Going to snow tonight for sure.

01:40:42.571 --> 01:40:43.629
Yup.

01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:54.738
All this time and you ain't
found nobody else to marry?

01:40:56.552 --> 01:40:57.951
I been puttin' the blocks...

01:40:58.020 --> 01:41:00.887
to a good-lookin' little gal
over in Riverton.

01:41:02.391 --> 01:41:06.293
She's a waitress. Wants to go
to nursing school or somethin'.

01:41:09.264 --> 01:41:10.630
I don't know.

01:41:14.136 --> 01:41:16.161
What about you and Lureen?

01:41:18.674 --> 01:41:21.473
Lureen's good at making hard deals
in the machinery business...

01:41:21.543 --> 01:41:23.978
but as far as
our marriage goes...

01:41:24.513 --> 01:41:26.743
we could do it over the phone.

01:41:36.658 --> 01:41:39.389
I kind of got this thing
going with...

01:41:40.295 --> 01:41:42.958
a ranch foreman's wife
over in Rutters.

01:41:43.332 --> 01:41:44.993
- What?
- I'm bound to get shot...

01:41:45.067 --> 01:41:48.400
by Lureen or her husband each
time I slip off to see her.

01:41:49.571 --> 01:41:51.596
You probably deserve it.

01:41:58.547 --> 01:42:00.106
Tell you what.

01:42:05.153 --> 01:42:06.678
The truth is...

01:42:13.662 --> 01:42:16.961
sometimes I miss you so much,
I can hardly stand it.

01:42:59.241 --> 01:43:01.971
I guess I'll head up
on to Lightning Flat.

01:43:03.345 --> 01:43:05.643
See the folks for a day or two.

01:43:11.553 --> 01:43:14.750
There's somethin' I been
meanin' to tell you, bud.

01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:22.353
Well, it's likely November before
I can come out here again.

01:43:25.767 --> 01:43:30.000
After we ship stock and before
winter feedin' starts again.

01:43:33.909 --> 01:43:35.137
November.

01:43:39.214 --> 01:43:41.945
What in the hell ever happened
to August?

01:43:42.851 --> 01:43:43.841
Well...

01:43:47.022 --> 01:43:48.512
Christ, Ennis.

01:43:54.496 --> 01:43:58.660
You know, you had a fucking week to
say some little word about this.

01:44:01.169 --> 01:44:03.604
Why is it we're always
in the friggin' cold?

01:44:03.672 --> 01:44:06.266
We ought to go south
where it's warm, you know!

01:44:06.341 --> 01:44:08.332
We ought to go to Mexico.

01:44:09.177 --> 01:44:10.372
Mexico?

01:44:11.713 --> 01:44:14.205
Hell, Jack, you know me. About
all the travelin' I ever done...

01:44:14.282 --> 01:44:17.343
is around a coffee pot,
looking for the handle.

01:44:19.788 --> 01:44:22.120
Come on, Jack.
Lighten up on me.

01:44:24.226 --> 01:44:26.194
We can hunt in November.

01:44:27.028 --> 01:44:28.758
Kill us a nice elk.

01:44:31.299 --> 01:44:33.165
I'll try if I can get
Don Wroe's cabin again.

01:44:33.235 --> 01:44:35.931
We had a good time that year,
didn't we?

01:44:38.573 --> 01:44:41.270
There's never enough time,
never enough.

01:44:45.747 --> 01:44:47.477
You know, friend...

01:44:48.583 --> 01:44:52.076
this is a goddamn bitch of
an unsatisfactory situation.

01:44:53.155 --> 01:44:56.784
You used to come away easy.
Now it's like seein' the Pope.

01:44:59.761 --> 01:45:01.525
Jack, I got to work.

01:45:04.633 --> 01:45:07.534
In them earlier days,
I'd just quit the job.

01:45:10.272 --> 01:45:11.603
You...

01:45:12.274 --> 01:45:15.539
You forget what it's like
bein' broke all the time.

01:45:19.147 --> 01:45:21.445
You ever hear of child support?

01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:27.652
I'll tell you this,
I can't quit this one...

01:45:27.722 --> 01:45:29.714
and I can't get the time off.

01:45:33.662 --> 01:45:35.653
It was hard enough
gettin' this time.

01:45:35.730 --> 01:45:37.460
The trade-off was August.

01:45:41.603 --> 01:45:43.469
Well, you got a better idea?

01:45:46.274 --> 01:45:47.674
I did, once.

01:45:49.878 --> 01:45:51.368
You did, once.

01:45:56.218 --> 01:45:58.743
Well, have you been to Mexico,
Jack Twist?

01:46:01.423 --> 01:46:04.950
'Cause I hear what they got
in Mexico for boys like you.

01:46:06.695 --> 01:46:10.256
Hell, yes, I've been to Mexico.
Is that a fucking problem?

01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:21.742
I'm going to tell you this
one time, Jack fucking Twist.

01:46:21.810 --> 01:46:23.573
And I ain't foolin'.

01:46:24.913 --> 01:46:28.577
What I don't know, all them
things that I don't know...

01:46:28.984 --> 01:46:31.885
could get you killed
if I come to know them.

01:46:36.057 --> 01:46:37.582
I ain't jokin'.

01:46:42.397 --> 01:46:45.059
Yeah, well try this one,
and I'll say it just once.

01:46:45.133 --> 01:46:47.830
- Go ahead!
- I'll tell you what.

01:46:47.902 --> 01:46:49.370
We could have had
a good life together.

01:46:49.437 --> 01:46:52.635
Fucking real good life.
Had us a place of our own!

01:46:53.675 --> 01:46:55.734
But you didn't want it, Ennis.

01:46:55.810 --> 01:46:58.609
So what we got now
is Brokeback Mountain!

01:47:00.849 --> 01:47:04.148
Everything's built on that! That's
all we got, boy. Fucking all.

01:47:04.219 --> 01:47:06.847
So I hope you know that, if you
don't never know the rest!

01:47:06.921 --> 01:47:09.186
You count the damn few times...

01:47:09.257 --> 01:47:11.055
that we have been together
in nearly 20 years...

01:47:11.126 --> 01:47:13.253
and you measure the short
fucking leash you keep me on...

01:47:13.328 --> 01:47:15.956
and then you ask me about Mexico
and you tell me you'll kill me...

01:47:16.031 --> 01:47:19.091
for needin' somethin'
I don't hardly never get!

01:47:21.670 --> 01:47:24.605
You have no idea
how bad it gets!

01:47:28.143 --> 01:47:31.078
And I'm not you!
I can't make it...

01:47:31.146 --> 01:47:34.673
on a couple of high-altitude
fucks once or twice a year!

01:47:37.252 --> 01:47:39.550
You are too much for me, Ennis.

01:47:40.255 --> 01:47:42.382
You son of a whoreson bitch!

01:47:44.559 --> 01:47:46.789
I wish I knew how to quit you!

01:47:49.431 --> 01:47:51.160
Then why don't you?

01:47:54.102 --> 01:47:56.537
Why don't you just
let me be, huh?

01:47:58.606 --> 01:48:01.599
It's because of you, Jack,
that I'm like this.

01:48:05.246 --> 01:48:06.646
I'm nothin'.

01:48:07.315 --> 01:48:08.715
I'm nowhere.

01:48:13.388 --> 01:48:16.016
- It's okay.
- Get the fuck off me!

01:48:23.098 --> 01:48:25.692
It's all right. It's all right.

01:48:26.768 --> 01:48:28.361
Damn you, Ennis.

01:48:29.704 --> 01:48:32.298
I just can't stand
this any more, Jack.

01:48:42.817 --> 01:48:46.276
Come on now, you're sleepin'
on your feet like a horse.

01:48:48.623 --> 01:48:51.786
My mama used to say that to me
when I was little.

01:48:52.827 --> 01:48:54.523
And sing to me.

01:49:08.376 --> 01:49:09.776
I got to go.

01:49:12.714 --> 01:49:14.648
See you in the morning.

01:50:09.804 --> 01:50:11.135
Excuse me.

01:50:16.211 --> 01:50:17.269
Hey.

01:50:18.246 --> 01:50:19.736
Ennis Del Mar.

01:50:23.318 --> 01:50:24.842
Where you been?

01:50:26.821 --> 01:50:28.346
Here and there.

01:50:31.025 --> 01:50:34.154
I left word for you
with Steve at the ranch.

01:50:35.063 --> 01:50:38.431
And you must've got those
notes I left at your place.

01:50:42.237 --> 01:50:45.036
Looks like I got the message,
in any case.

01:50:47.275 --> 01:50:48.367
Carl?

01:50:50.211 --> 01:50:52.180
Yeah, Carl's nice.

01:50:52.947 --> 01:50:54.438
He even talks.

01:50:57.652 --> 01:50:59.120
Good for you.

01:51:01.489 --> 01:51:02.581
Yeah.

01:51:05.593 --> 01:51:06.993
Good for me.

01:51:13.434 --> 01:51:15.733
I don't get you, Ennis Del Mar.

01:51:21.075 --> 01:51:22.407
I'm sorry.

01:51:30.885 --> 01:51:33.411
I was probably
no fun anyways, was I?

01:51:36.891 --> 01:51:39.827
Ennis, girls don't
fall in love with fun.

01:52:22.570 --> 01:52:26.234
Hello.
Hello, this is Ennis Del Mar.

01:52:29.544 --> 01:52:31.171
Who? Who is this?

01:52:32.747 --> 01:52:35.546
Ennis Del Mar.
I'm an old buddy of Jack's.

01:52:36.651 --> 01:52:38.744
Jack used to mention you.

01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:42.818
You're the fishing buddy or the
hunting buddy, I know that.

01:52:43.891 --> 01:52:45.655
Would have let you know
what happened...

01:52:45.727 --> 01:52:48.252
but I wasn't sure
about your name or address.

01:52:48.329 --> 01:52:51.265
Jack kept his friends'
addresses in his head.

01:52:53.167 --> 01:52:56.103
That's why I'm callin',
to see what happened.

01:52:58.106 --> 01:52:59.630
Oh, yeah.

01:53:02.076 --> 01:53:05.012
Jack was pumpin' up a flat
on the truck...

01:53:05.113 --> 01:53:07.843
out on a back road,
when the tire blew up.

01:53:07.982 --> 01:53:10.884
The rim of the tire slammed
into his face...

01:53:11.085 --> 01:53:14.988
broke his nose and jaw and knocked
him unconscious on his back.

01:53:16.257 --> 01:53:19.716
By the time somebody come along,
he'd drowned in his own blood.

01:53:20.828 --> 01:53:22.819
He was only 39 years old.

01:53:27.435 --> 01:53:29.870
Hello? Hello?

01:53:31.105 --> 01:53:32.334
Hello.

01:53:35.977 --> 01:53:37.968
Was he buried down there?

01:53:38.713 --> 01:53:40.147
We put a stone up.

01:53:40.615 --> 01:53:42.640
He was cremated,
like he wanted.

01:53:42.717 --> 01:53:46.984
Half his ashes was interred here, the
rest was sent up with his folks.

01:53:48.256 --> 01:53:52.283
He use to say he wanted his ashes
scattered on Brokeback Mountain...

01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:54.761
but I wasn't sure
where that was.

01:53:55.129 --> 01:53:58.895
I thought Brokeback Mountain might
be around where he grew up.

01:53:58.966 --> 01:54:00.264
Knowing Jack...

01:54:00.334 --> 01:54:02.599
it might be some
pretend place...

01:54:02.670 --> 01:54:05.867
where bluebirds sing
and there's a whiskey spring.

01:54:08.843 --> 01:54:10.277
No, ma'am...

01:54:11.345 --> 01:54:14.474
we was herdin' sheep
on Brokeback one summer...

01:54:15.116 --> 01:54:16.515
back in '63.

01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:28.657
Well, he said
it was his favorite place.

01:54:30.031 --> 01:54:33.228
I thought he meant to
get drunk. He drank a lot.

01:54:36.437 --> 01:54:39.304
Is his folks still up
in Lightning Flat?

01:54:39.974 --> 01:54:42.671
They'll be there
till the day they die.

01:54:47.715 --> 01:54:49.684
Thank you for your time.

01:54:50.551 --> 01:54:52.144
I sure am sorry.

01:54:53.388 --> 01:54:55.151
We was good friends.

01:55:02.330 --> 01:55:04.560
Get in touch with his folks.

01:55:04.632 --> 01:55:08.432
I suppose they'd appreciate it
if his wishes was carried out.

01:55:10.271 --> 01:55:12.239
About the ashes, I mean.

01:56:13.034 --> 01:56:16.470
Want a cup of coffee, don't you?
Piece of cherry cake?

01:56:16.537 --> 01:56:18.096
Yes, ma'am,
I'll have a cup of coffee...

01:56:18.172 --> 01:56:21.335
but I can't eat no cake
just now. Thank you.

01:56:30.017 --> 01:56:32.179
I feel awful bad about Jack.

01:56:35.022 --> 01:56:36.354
Thank you.

01:56:38.326 --> 01:56:41.125
I can't begin to tell you
how bad I feel.

01:56:44.131 --> 01:56:46.032
I knew him a long time.

01:56:48.936 --> 01:56:50.905
I come by to say that...

01:56:51.572 --> 01:56:55.202
if you want me to take his
ashes up there on Brokeback...

01:56:55.943 --> 01:56:58.378
like his wife said
he wanted to...

01:56:59.146 --> 01:57:00.944
then I'll be happy to.

01:57:04.051 --> 01:57:05.781
I'll tell you what.

01:57:06.854 --> 01:57:09.255
I know where
Brokeback Mountain is.

01:57:10.524 --> 01:57:14.655
Thought he was too goddamn special
to be buried in the family plot.

01:57:18.065 --> 01:57:19.795
Jack used to say...

01:57:20.635 --> 01:57:23.297
"Ennis Del Mar,"
he used to say.

01:57:24.972 --> 01:57:28.238
"I'm gonna bring him up here
one of these days..."

01:57:28.876 --> 01:57:31.812
"and we'll lick this
damn ranch into shape."

01:57:33.247 --> 01:57:35.079
He had some
half-baked notion...

01:57:35.149 --> 01:57:37.743
the two of you was gonna
move up here...

01:57:38.219 --> 01:57:39.812
build a cabin...

01:57:40.855 --> 01:57:42.584
help run the place.

01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:47.890
Then, this spring...

01:57:49.497 --> 01:57:52.728
he got another fella
gonna come up here with him...

01:57:54.402 --> 01:57:57.599
build the place,
help run the ranch.

01:57:58.606 --> 01:58:03.043
Some ranch neighbor of his
from down in Texas.

01:58:05.112 --> 01:58:08.412
Gonna split up with his wife
and come back here...

01:58:09.183 --> 01:58:10.548
so he says.

01:58:12.386 --> 01:58:14.719
But, like most of
Jack's ideas...

01:58:16.557 --> 01:58:18.287
never come to pass.

01:58:21.429 --> 01:58:25.297
I kept his room
like it was when he was a boy.

01:58:26.701 --> 01:58:28.828
I think he appreciated that.

01:58:33.374 --> 01:58:36.571
You are welcome to go up
to his room, if you want.

01:58:42.249 --> 01:58:44.548
Yeah, I'd like that. Thank you.

02:01:45.733 --> 02:01:47.326
Tell you what.

02:01:49.837 --> 02:01:53.569
We got a family plot.
He's goin' in it.

02:01:56.243 --> 02:01:57.506
Yes, sir.

02:02:00.114 --> 02:02:02.412
You come back and see us again.

02:02:16.730 --> 02:02:18.221
Thank you, ma'am.

02:03:16.023 --> 02:03:18.685
- Hey there, Junior.
- Hey, Daddy.

02:03:27.534 --> 02:03:28.832
Come here.

02:03:31.639 --> 02:03:33.106
Like the car?

02:03:33.574 --> 02:03:36.373
- Yeah. Is it yours?
- It's Kurt's.

02:03:37.111 --> 02:03:40.205
- I thought you were seein' Troy.
- Troy?

02:03:40.781 --> 02:03:43.011
Daddy, that was two years ago.

02:03:44.451 --> 02:03:46.750
Troy still playing baseball?

02:03:47.121 --> 02:03:50.318
I don't know what he's doing.
I'm seein' Kurt now.

02:03:50.724 --> 02:03:53.887
- Well, what does Kurt do?
- Works out in the oil fields.

02:03:55.663 --> 02:03:58.996
- So he's a roughneck?
- Yeah.

02:03:59.833 --> 02:04:03.668
I guess you're 10, you can do whatever you want.
Isn't that right?

02:04:03.737 --> 02:04:05.034
Sure.

02:04:13.647 --> 02:04:16.708
- Daddy, you need more furniture.
- Yeah, well...

02:04:17.351 --> 02:04:20.184
if you got nothin',
you don't need nothin'.

02:04:24.458 --> 02:04:26.426
So, what's the occasion?

02:04:30.864 --> 02:04:32.355
Me and Kurt...

02:04:33.667 --> 02:04:35.533
we're getting married.

02:04:38.305 --> 02:04:39.705
Well...

02:04:40.507 --> 02:04:43.033
So how long have you
known this guy for?

02:04:43.210 --> 02:04:44.678
About a year.

02:04:46.680 --> 02:04:50.048
Our wedding will be June 5,
at the Methodist church.

02:04:50.351 --> 02:04:54.151
Jenny will be singing and Monroe
is gonna cater the reception.

02:05:00.627 --> 02:05:02.619
Now this Kurt fella...

02:05:04.965 --> 02:05:06.433
he loves you?

02:05:09.203 --> 02:05:10.796
Yeah, Daddy.

02:05:12.072 --> 02:05:13.472
He loves me.

02:05:21.515 --> 02:05:23.540
Was hopin' you'd be there.

02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:27.446
Yeah.

02:05:30.724 --> 02:05:35.218
I think I'm supposed to be on a
roundup down near the Tetons.

02:05:56.150 --> 02:05:57.742
You know what?

02:05:59.086 --> 02:06:02.146
I reckon they can find
themselves a new cowboy.

02:06:03.957 --> 02:06:07.485
My little girl,
getting married.

02:06:21.108 --> 02:06:23.167
To Alma and Kurt.

02:07:43.657 --> 02:07:45.455
Jack, I swear...
