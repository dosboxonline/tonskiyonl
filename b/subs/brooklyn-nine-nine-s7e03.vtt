[snoring]

00:05.631 --> 00:06.882
[sighs]

00:06.924 --> 00:08.884
[whispers]

00:06.924 --> 00:08.884
It's happening again.

00:08.926 --> 00:11.136
Rosa, Rosa, Hitchcock fell

00:08.926 --> 00:11.136
asleep in the break room.

00:11.178 --> 00:13.012
I pranked him.

00:11.178 --> 00:13.012
I tied his shoelaces

00:11.178 --> 00:13.012
together.

00:13.054 --> 00:14.849
-You're 38 years old, dude.

00:13.054 --> 00:14.849
-I know,

00:14.890 --> 00:17.351
and yet my pranks

00:14.890 --> 00:17.351
still stay so fresh--

00:14.890 --> 00:17.351
its incredible.

00:17.392 --> 00:19.102
You gotta untie his shoes

00:17.392 --> 00:19.102
before he gets hurt.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.604
Ohh-- Seriously?

00:20.646 --> 00:22.690
-Seriously.

00:20.646 --> 00:22.690
-Ugh, fine.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.358
But what's the worst thing

00:22.731 --> 00:24.358
that could happen?

00:24.399 --> 00:26.735
-[gasping]

00:24.399 --> 00:26.735
-He's being strangled

00:24.399 --> 00:26.735
to death!

00:26.777 --> 00:27.778
How?!

00:27.820 --> 00:31.031
[theme song playing]

00:49.424 --> 00:50.926
[sighs]

00:53.094 --> 00:55.639
-So...you still annoyed?

00:53.094 --> 00:55.639
-Yes.

00:55.681 --> 00:58.851
You can't keep saying

00:55.681 --> 00:58.851
"mischief managed"

00:55.681 --> 00:58.851
after we finish sex.

00:58.893 --> 01:01.436
It's what Harry Potter says

00:58.893 --> 01:01.436
when he needs to clear

00:58.893 --> 01:01.436
the Marauder's Map.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.939
Obviously, I know that,

01:01.478 --> 01:03.939
but I would prefer

01:03.981 --> 01:06.025
to keep wizard terms

01:03.981 --> 01:06.025
out of our sex life.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.442
But what we're doing

01:06.066 --> 01:07.442
is magical.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.611
-We're making a baby.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.611
-[sighs]

01:09.653 --> 01:11.154
Wait, why'd you stop

01:09.653 --> 01:11.154
the elevator?

01:11.196 --> 01:14.992
Look, I know you're excited,

01:11.196 --> 01:14.992
and I am too,

01:15.034 --> 01:16.785
but I really don't

01:15.034 --> 01:16.785
want to talk

01:16.827 --> 01:18.495
about us trying to get pregnant

01:16.827 --> 01:18.495
while we're at work.

01:18.537 --> 01:20.372
You haven't said anything

01:18.537 --> 01:20.372
to Charles, right?

01:20.414 --> 01:22.332
No, and it's killing me.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.083
I still don't get why you can

01:22.374 --> 01:24.083
tell Rosa but I can't tell him.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.420
-Rosa's low-key.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.420
-Charles can be low-key.

01:26.461 --> 01:27.922
So how was

01:26.461 --> 01:27.922
everyone's weekend?

01:27.963 --> 01:29.339
Oh, uh,

01:27.963 --> 01:29.339
we bought a couch.

01:29.381 --> 01:31.383
Whoo-hoo!

01:29.381 --> 01:31.383
Tell me everything!

01:31.425 --> 01:34.093
Okay, fine,

01:31.425 --> 01:34.093
he can be a bit much.

01:34.135 --> 01:35.721
But don't worry.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.681
I have a plan that guarantees

01:35.763 --> 01:37.681
I'm not gonna tell him.

01:37.723 --> 01:39.474
I've cut him out

01:37.723 --> 01:39.474
of my life completely.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.060
That doesn't

01:39.516 --> 01:41.060
seem sustainable.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.770
Yeah, well, so far,

01:41.100 --> 01:42.770
it's working

01:42.811 --> 01:44.312
and it's foolproof,

01:42.811 --> 01:44.312
so--

01:44.354 --> 01:46.440
Morning!

01:44.354 --> 01:46.440
Jake, can I talk to you

01:44.354 --> 01:46.440
for a second?

01:46.481 --> 01:48.984
-Mm-hmm.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.984
-I feel like we haven't

01:46.481 --> 01:48.984
hung out in forever.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.444
Oh, is that so? I didn't

01:49.026 --> 01:50.444
realize. Is that the case?

01:50.485 --> 01:52.947
Wanna get a drink

01:50.485 --> 01:52.947
after work tonight?

01:52.988 --> 01:54.823
I'm dying to tell you

01:52.988 --> 01:54.823
about Genevieve's new shampoo.

01:52.988 --> 01:54.823
[whispers] It's edible.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.324
Oh, wow,

01:54.865 --> 01:56.324
that sounds so fun,

01:56.366 --> 01:59.661
but I actually... can't

01:56.366 --> 01:59.661
because I have plans

01:59.703 --> 02:01.914
with Ted... Crap!

01:59.703 --> 02:01.914
It's a friend of Amy's.

02:01.956 --> 02:04.458
The point is, I'm unavailable

02:01.956 --> 02:04.458
for a very real reason.

02:04.499 --> 02:05.626
[Pimento]

02:04.499 --> 02:05.626
Jake!

02:05.667 --> 02:06.752
-Oh, my God, is that...

02:05.667 --> 02:06.752
-Boyle!

02:06.794 --> 02:08.045
It does sound like...

02:08.087 --> 02:10.213
[gasping]

02:08.087 --> 02:10.213
It's me, Adrian Pimento.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.507
Yeah, we know.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.507
Hi, Adrian. How are you?

02:12.549 --> 02:15.218
Very bad, someone's

02:12.549 --> 02:15.218
trying to kill me.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.929
Before we wrap up

02:15.260 --> 02:16.929
this briefing,

02:16.971 --> 02:19.056
I wanted to give

02:16.971 --> 02:19.056
a few shout-outs.

02:19.098 --> 02:21.016
Diaz, great job on that B&amp;E.

02:21.058 --> 02:23.769
You are a good cop

02:21.058 --> 02:23.769
with a great attitude.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.813
-I don't like this.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.813
-Santiago, when I think

02:25.854 --> 02:29.524
of your CompStat reports,

02:25.854 --> 02:29.524
one word comes to mind: "Wow."

02:29.566 --> 02:32.360
And that "WOW" is an acronym

02:29.566 --> 02:32.360
for "Wow, Oh, Wow."

02:32.402 --> 02:33.946
-What is happening?

02:32.402 --> 02:33.946
-He's buttering us up

02:33.988 --> 02:36.364
before giving us some

02:33.988 --> 02:36.364
devastatingly bad news.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.575
My God, Jake and Charles

02:36.406 --> 02:38.575
are dead.

02:38.617 --> 02:40.577
[Terry] Jake and Charles

02:38.617 --> 02:40.577
are not dead.

02:40.619 --> 02:41.829
It's worse than that.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.330
We have to do

02:41.870 --> 02:43.330
our annual HR seminar

02:43.371 --> 02:44.832
on workplace conflict

02:43.371 --> 02:44.832
tomorrow.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.083
-[all groan]

02:44.873 --> 02:46.083
-What?! Already?!

02:46.125 --> 02:47.793
I know.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.087
These seminars are not exactly

02:47.835 --> 02:50.087
our favorite things.

02:50.129 --> 02:51.379
Question:

02:50.129 --> 02:51.379
if I get shot

02:51.421 --> 02:52.756
in the line of duty,

02:51.421 --> 02:52.756
can I miss it?

02:52.798 --> 02:53.882
Legally, you still

02:52.798 --> 02:53.882
have to make it up.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.550
Well, there goes

02:53.924 --> 02:55.550
that plan.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.970
Sir, it's a seminar

02:55.592 --> 02:57.970
that's too boring for<i> me.</i>

02:58.012 --> 03:00.055
I'm saying no to a seminar.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.807
Look, it's mandatory,

03:00.097 --> 03:01.807
it's not up for debate,

03:01.849 --> 03:03.433
but we'll get through it

03:03.475 --> 03:05.019
'cause we're the

03:03.475 --> 03:05.019
best squad in the city--

03:05.060 --> 03:07.479
with the nicest hair,

03:05.060 --> 03:07.479
the kindest eyes...

03:07.521 --> 03:10.231
He's buttering us up

03:07.521 --> 03:10.231
again, so more bad

03:07.521 --> 03:10.231
news is coming.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.275
HR said they're

03:10.273 --> 03:12.275
sending a funny guy.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.276
[all groan]

03:13.318 --> 03:14.820
-No!

03:13.318 --> 03:14.820
-Hate that guy.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.447
All I know is, I woke up

03:14.862 --> 03:17.447
in a pool of my own blood

03:17.489 --> 03:19.908
next to a metal chair

03:17.489 --> 03:19.908
that had a dent in it

03:19.950 --> 03:22.285
the same shape

03:19.950 --> 03:22.285
as my head.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.578
What were you doing

03:22.327 --> 03:23.578
before the attack?

03:23.620 --> 03:25.288
I was sitting in said

03:23.620 --> 03:25.288
metal chair watching

03:25.330 --> 03:27.624
the season two premiere

03:25.330 --> 03:27.624
of<i> The Masked Singer.</i>

03:27.666 --> 03:30.544
The Egg had just gone,

03:27.666 --> 03:30.544
and I'm pretty sure

03:27.666 --> 03:30.544
I know who it is,

03:30.585 --> 03:32.963
-Sara Gilbert.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.963
-That doesn't make any sense.

03:33.005 --> 03:35.340
Are you kidding?

03:33.005 --> 03:35.340
You don't think I know

03:33.005 --> 03:35.340
how Darlene walks?

03:35.382 --> 03:37.092
No, no, no, no,

03:35.382 --> 03:37.092
I'm sure you do,

03:37.134 --> 03:39.386
it's just<i> The Masked Singer</i>

03:37.134 --> 03:39.386
ended four months ago.

03:39.427 --> 03:42.056
I still can't believe

03:39.427 --> 03:42.056
that the Bowl of Ramen

03:39.427 --> 03:42.056
wasn't Dikembe Mutombo.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.516
Four month-- no, no, no.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.516
I watched this last night.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.601
-That doesn't make any--

03:44.558 --> 03:46.601
<i>-[dramatic musical flourish]</i>

03:46.643 --> 03:48.353
Where am I?

03:48.395 --> 03:50.397
-What is that table?!

03:48.395 --> 03:50.397
-Calm down.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.816
You're at the Nine-Nine,

03:50.438 --> 03:52.816
and you know what a table is.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.401
I don't remember

03:52.858 --> 03:54.401
coming here.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.401
How did I get here?

03:54.442 --> 03:56.277
Oh, my God.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.113
Pimento has

03:56.319 --> 03:58.113
Memento disease.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.614
Your memory

03:58.155 --> 03:59.614
is resetting

03:59.656 --> 04:01.950
like the guy from

03:59.656 --> 04:01.950
the movie<i> Memento.</i>

04:01.992 --> 04:03.577
-What?

04:01.992 --> 04:03.577
-You guys never saw<i> Memento?</i>

04:03.618 --> 04:05.412
It's the guy with

04:03.618 --> 04:05.412
no short-term memory,

04:05.453 --> 04:06.914
you know, Christopher Nolan's

04:05.453 --> 04:06.914
first movie.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.623
Is it like Dory

04:06.955 --> 04:08.623
from<i> Finding Dory,</i>

04:08.665 --> 04:10.125
she keeps forgetting

04:08.665 --> 04:10.125
where she's swimming?

04:10.167 --> 04:12.460
-No, no, it's like--

04:10.167 --> 04:12.460
-Dory, yeah, yeah, yeah!

04:12.502 --> 04:14.171
I'm like the forgetful

04:12.502 --> 04:14.171
little fish.

04:14.213 --> 04:15.839
-Ah.

04:14.213 --> 04:15.839
-Oh, I mean, yeah,

04:14.213 --> 04:15.839
it's like that,

04:15.881 --> 04:17.465
-but it's also like--

04:15.881 --> 04:17.465
-Just keep swimming!

04:17.507 --> 04:19.300
-That's what Dory says.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.300
-Classic Dory, Jake!

04:19.342 --> 04:20.677
Ugh, you guys

04:19.342 --> 04:20.677
really ruined

04:20.719 --> 04:22.221
the coolness of this

04:20.719 --> 04:22.221
<i>Memento</i> thing.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.680
Also, Jake,<i> Following</i>

04:23.722 --> 04:25.265
is Christopher Nolan's

04:23.722 --> 04:25.265
first movie.

04:25.306 --> 04:27.559
You sound like a grade A

04:25.306 --> 04:27.559
[bleep] out here.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.062
'Sup, squad?

04:30.104 --> 04:32.689
Hope y'all like

04:30.104 --> 04:32.689
condiments, because

04:30.104 --> 04:32.689
I got all the sauce.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.024
Huh?

04:34.066 --> 04:35.483
I arrested a tween

04:34.066 --> 04:35.483
shoplifter yesterday,

04:35.525 --> 04:38.028
and she was real

04:35.525 --> 04:38.028
cool at talking.

04:38.070 --> 04:40.864
I love you, Amy, but maybe

04:38.070 --> 04:40.864
slang isn't your thing.

04:40.906 --> 04:42.574
[chuckles]

04:40.906 --> 04:42.574
Whatevs.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.325
Check it: I got a copy

04:44.367 --> 04:46.494
of last year's workplace

04:44.367 --> 04:46.494
conflict presentation.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.581
All we have to do

04:46.536 --> 04:49.581
is study the crap out of it,

04:49.623 --> 04:51.166
then we can answer

04:49.623 --> 04:51.166
every question

04:51.208 --> 04:53.585
before that tool from

04:51.208 --> 04:53.585
HR even asks it.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.295
We'll be done in no time.

04:55.336 --> 04:57.464
So your solution for

04:55.336 --> 04:57.464
getting us out of

04:55.336 --> 04:57.464
the boring seminar

04:57.505 --> 04:59.507
is having us memorize

04:57.505 --> 04:59.507
the boring seminar.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.343
-Exactly.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.343
-It's genius--<i> and</i> it's fun.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.804
I love committing

05:02.385 --> 05:03.804
things to memory.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.513
Yeah, I'm out.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.513
I don't do homework.

05:05.555 --> 05:06.932
You do now.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.643
-Get busy, ya flope.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.643
-Flope?

05:09.684 --> 05:11.812
It means loser, okay?

05:09.684 --> 05:11.812
It's new slang.

05:11.853 --> 05:14.231
People are saying it!

05:11.853 --> 05:14.231
The tween said so!

05:14.273 --> 05:15.732
It just doesn't

05:14.273 --> 05:15.732
make any sense.

05:15.774 --> 05:17.067
I mean, you love

05:15.774 --> 05:17.067
<i>The Dark Knight,</i>

05:17.109 --> 05:18.526
you love<i> Inception,</i>

05:18.568 --> 05:20.154
and you haven't even

05:18.568 --> 05:20.154
seen<i> Memento</i> ?

05:20.195 --> 05:21.571
Jake, I don't know

05:20.195 --> 05:21.571
what to tell ya.

05:21.613 --> 05:23.115
I spend a lot of time

05:21.613 --> 05:23.115
in jungles, you know.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.908
They don't exactly

05:23.157 --> 05:24.908
get movies like that.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.910
It's usually big blockbusters

05:24.950 --> 05:26.910
like<i> Finding Dory.</i>

05:26.952 --> 05:28.411
486 million, domestic.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.914
When you factor in

05:28.453 --> 05:30.914
international,

05:28.453 --> 05:30.914
1.2 billion.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.333
Look, Adrian, we don't

05:30.956 --> 05:33.333
have a ton to go off on here.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.585
-What else has been

05:33.374 --> 05:35.585
going on in your life?

05:33.374 --> 05:35.585
-[Pimento] Normal stuff.

05:35.627 --> 05:38.713
Ooh, I got hired as a PI

05:35.627 --> 05:38.713
by the Countess Luann

05:35.627 --> 05:38.713
from<i> Real Housewives.</i>

05:38.755 --> 05:41.800
I ended up sleeping

05:38.755 --> 05:41.800
with her in a tiny

05:38.755 --> 05:41.800
hotel Jacuzzi.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.426
I also microwaved

05:41.842 --> 05:43.426
a watermelon

05:43.468 --> 05:44.678
just to see if

05:43.468 --> 05:44.678
it would explode.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.263
Okay, this is

05:44.719 --> 05:46.263
immediately unhelpful,

05:46.305 --> 05:48.974
but...<i> did</i> the

05:46.305 --> 05:48.974
watermelon explode?

05:49.016 --> 05:50.642
It just cracked

05:49.016 --> 05:50.642
and got hot.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.351
-Oh.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.351
-Total bust.

05:52.393 --> 05:53.603
Hey, maybe one

05:52.393 --> 05:53.603
of your PI cases

05:53.645 --> 05:54.980
is the reason

05:53.645 --> 05:54.980
you got attacked.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.773
I thought of that too,

05:55.022 --> 05:56.773
but I doubt it.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.733
You know, they're

05:56.815 --> 05:58.733
all the same,

05:56.815 --> 05:58.733
kinda boring.

05:58.775 --> 06:02.237
It's some redheaded

05:58.775 --> 06:02.237
lady wants me to hack

05:58.775 --> 06:02.237
her husband's phone

06:02.279 --> 06:05.324
to see if he's cheating

06:02.279 --> 06:05.324
with a spin instructor

06:02.279 --> 06:05.324
named Kendra.

06:05.364 --> 06:06.825
It seems a

06:05.364 --> 06:06.825
little specific

06:06.867 --> 06:08.035
that they would all

06:06.867 --> 06:08.035
be like that, but okay.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.077
[high-pitched beeping]

06:09.119 --> 06:10.537
Where is that

06:09.119 --> 06:10.537
coming from?

06:10.578 --> 06:11.913
Oh, my God, there's

06:10.578 --> 06:11.913
a bomb in my chest!

06:11.955 --> 06:13.498
-What?!

06:11.955 --> 06:13.498
-They put a bomb in my chest!

06:13.540 --> 06:15.000
-What do we do?

06:13.540 --> 06:15.000
-[screaming]

06:15.042 --> 06:17.544
[beeping speeds up]

06:17.585 --> 06:19.338
Wait a second, the

06:17.585 --> 06:19.338
sound's coming from

06:17.585 --> 06:19.338
my little watch.

06:19.378 --> 06:20.839
[laughs]

06:20.881 --> 06:22.507
You just assumed

06:20.881 --> 06:22.507
there was a bomb

06:20.881 --> 06:22.507
inside you?

06:22.549 --> 06:26.220
It says, "Take pill,

06:22.549 --> 06:26.220
right jacket po"--

06:26.261 --> 06:28.305
I've never seen these

06:26.261 --> 06:28.305
before in my life.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.141
This was filled

06:29.472 --> 06:31.141
three days ago.

06:31.183 --> 06:34.144
[gasps]

06:31.183 --> 06:34.144
This doctor must be

06:31.183 --> 06:34.144
treating you for your...

06:34.186 --> 06:36.021
Finding Dory Disease,

06:36.063 --> 06:38.106
that's what most

06:36.063 --> 06:38.106
people call

06:36.063 --> 06:38.106
anterograde amnesia.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.234
[both]

06:38.148 --> 06:40.234
Just keep swimmin'.

06:40.275 --> 06:42.610
Exactly, that's what

06:40.275 --> 06:42.610
I tell my patients:

06:40.275 --> 06:42.610
Just keep swimmin'.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.612
So what do you think

06:42.652 --> 06:44.612
caused Pimento's

06:42.652 --> 06:44.612
memory loss?

06:44.654 --> 06:46.573
Probably years of

06:44.654 --> 06:46.573
repeated head trauma.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.491
I've been working

06:46.614 --> 06:48.491
as a neurologist

06:48.533 --> 06:51.786
for over two decades,

06:48.533 --> 06:51.786
and I have<i> never</i>

06:48.533 --> 06:51.786
seen a patient

06:51.828 --> 06:53.705
with more traumatic

06:51.828 --> 06:53.705
head injuries.

06:53.747 --> 06:54.706
Well, doesn't look so bad.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.208
The red is the

06:54.748 --> 06:56.208
good parts.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.334
Oh, my God.

06:57.376 --> 06:58.377
Oh, I guess

06:57.376 --> 06:58.377
it does make sense.

06:58.417 --> 06:59.711
Pimento lives

06:58.417 --> 06:59.711
pretty hard.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.088
I locked my keys

06:59.753 --> 07:01.088
in the car again.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.463
I guess I'll have

07:01.129 --> 07:02.463
to smash the window.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.632
Well, actually, I got

07:02.505 --> 07:04.632
a hammer in my car.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.261
Come on,

07:06.009 --> 07:07.261
everybody knows

07:07.302 --> 07:08.970
the skull is the

07:07.302 --> 07:08.970
hammer of the body.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.430
Yeah, that's not true.

07:10.471 --> 07:11.556
What? Really?

07:11.598 --> 07:13.641
Okay, well,

07:11.598 --> 07:13.641
then this is on me.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.018
Look, this morning,

07:13.683 --> 07:15.018
Pimento was screaming

07:15.060 --> 07:16.895
about someone

07:15.060 --> 07:16.895
trying to kill him.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.605
Has he said anything

07:16.937 --> 07:18.605
like that to you?

07:18.646 --> 07:20.399
He has, but I've seen him

07:18.646 --> 07:20.399
every day for weeks,

07:20.440 --> 07:22.276
and I haven't noticed

07:20.440 --> 07:22.276
any new injuries,

07:22.317 --> 07:25.320
but the medication

07:22.317 --> 07:25.320
he's on may be making

07:22.317 --> 07:25.320
him paranoid.

07:25.362 --> 07:26.780
-Really? Because he doesn't--

07:25.362 --> 07:26.780
-[high-pitched beeping]

07:26.821 --> 07:28.448
[screams]

07:26.821 --> 07:28.448
There's a bomb in my chest!

07:28.489 --> 07:29.657
-[screams]

07:28.489 --> 07:29.657
-[beeping speeds up]

07:29.699 --> 07:31.451
Right, he does

07:29.699 --> 07:31.451
keep doing that.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.870
[Jake]

07:31.492 --> 07:33.870
Hey, it was nice of you

07:33.912 --> 07:35.372
to let Pimento crash

07:33.912 --> 07:35.372
at your place last night.

07:35.414 --> 07:37.249
-How'd it go?

07:35.414 --> 07:37.249
-Oh, well, he gave Nikolaj

07:37.291 --> 07:39.000
a haircut while

07:37.291 --> 07:39.000
he was asleep,

07:39.042 --> 07:41.128
but no weird memory stuff,

07:39.042 --> 07:41.128
so all in all, major win.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.046
Great, so it sounds

07:41.169 --> 07:43.046
like he might be

07:41.169 --> 07:43.046
getting better.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.631
[Pimento] Aaah! Someone's

07:43.088 --> 07:44.631
trying to kill me!

07:44.672 --> 07:46.383
Oh, boy, here

07:44.672 --> 07:46.383
we go again.

07:46.425 --> 07:48.468
-Ah, gah!

07:46.425 --> 07:48.468
-[Jake] Pimento,

07:46.425 --> 07:48.468
Pimento, Pimento!

07:48.509 --> 07:50.053
Don't worry.

07:48.509 --> 07:50.053
Everything's okay.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.388
You've had

07:50.095 --> 07:51.388
some brain trauma,

07:51.430 --> 07:52.931
and it caused you

07:51.430 --> 07:52.931
to lose your memory.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.808
You're scared

07:52.973 --> 07:54.808
that you're in danger,

07:54.849 --> 07:56.601
but there is no evidence

07:54.849 --> 07:56.601
that anyone is trying

07:54.849 --> 07:56.601
to kill you.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.061
-You're safe.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.061
-Wait, wait, really?

07:58.103 --> 07:59.646
Whew! Okay!

07:59.687 --> 08:01.606
[chuckles]

07:59.687 --> 08:01.606
Thank you.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.024
I was really worried,

08:01.648 --> 08:03.024
you know, 'cause of

08:01.648 --> 08:03.024
this gunshot wound.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.818
Oh, my God,

08:03.066 --> 08:04.818
someone's

08:03.066 --> 08:04.818
trying to kill you!

08:04.859 --> 08:07.904
What?! You just told me

08:04.859 --> 08:07.904
that wasn't the case!

08:09.656 --> 08:12.533
So there I am, naked,

08:09.656 --> 08:12.533
still holding the

08:09.656 --> 08:12.533
hedge trimmers,

08:12.575 --> 08:14.953
when the chauffeur

08:12.575 --> 08:14.953
walks in and I say,

08:14.995 --> 08:16.621
"Guess you caught

08:14.995 --> 08:16.621
me red-handed."

08:16.663 --> 08:18.457
-Because of the blood?

08:16.663 --> 08:18.457
-Yeah, because of the blood!

08:18.498 --> 08:20.708
See, you get it!

08:18.498 --> 08:20.708
[laughs]

08:20.750 --> 08:22.419
The bullet went through

08:20.750 --> 08:22.419
your friend's shoulder.

08:22.461 --> 08:24.963
He should be fine,

08:22.461 --> 08:24.963
although he does

08:22.461 --> 08:24.963
keep asking me

08:25.005 --> 08:26.465
if we do the "Face/Off"

08:25.005 --> 08:26.465
surgery here.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.300
[chuckles]

08:26.506 --> 08:28.300
And what'd you tell him?

08:28.342 --> 08:29.634
That we don't.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.761
[whispers]

08:29.676 --> 08:31.761
Right.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.638
-She's hiding something.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.638
-Obviously.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.308
Okay, Adrian, there's

08:33.680 --> 08:36.308
very little evidence

08:33.680 --> 08:36.308
to go on,

08:36.350 --> 08:38.435
so we should take a look

08:36.350 --> 08:38.435
at your PI case files.

08:38.477 --> 08:39.978
Don't have any.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.147
Keep everything

08:40.020 --> 08:42.147
right up here

08:40.020 --> 08:42.147
in the old steel--

08:42.189 --> 08:44.274
Where am I?!

08:42.189 --> 08:44.274
What is this bed?!

08:44.316 --> 08:46.026
And his memory's

08:44.316 --> 08:46.026
resetting. All right, Adrian,

08:46.067 --> 08:47.694
-someone's

08:46.067 --> 08:47.694
trying to kill you.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.694
-Uh-huh.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.488
-You have a memory disorder...

08:47.735 --> 08:49.488
-That makes sense.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.738
-Like in the movie<i> Memento.</i>

08:49.529 --> 08:50.738
-I haven't seen that!

08:50.780 --> 08:52.240
It's like<i> Finding Dory.</i>

08:52.282 --> 08:53.450
Ohh. Now I know

08:52.282 --> 08:53.450
exactly what's going on.

08:53.492 --> 08:54.493
Thank you, Charles.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.910
Okay, let's get

08:54.534 --> 08:55.910
you dressed

08:55.952 --> 08:57.037
and back to the precinct

08:55.952 --> 08:57.037
where it's safe.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.497
Okay.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.831
Oh, Adrian, the back

08:58.538 --> 08:59.831
of your gown's open.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.582
Don't peek at my tushy.

09:01.624 --> 09:04.252
I'm not. Wait, since when is

09:01.624 --> 09:04.252
your back covered in tattoos?

09:04.294 --> 09:05.920
It's not,

09:05.962 --> 09:07.755
otherwise I couldn't get buried

09:05.962 --> 09:07.755
in a Jewish cemetery.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.757
-Are you Jewish?

09:07.797 --> 09:09.757
-Not yet.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.510
Ooh, I should ask that

09:09.799 --> 09:11.510
nurse if they've got a

09:09.799 --> 09:11.510
<i>mohel</i> on staff.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.136
Wait, maybe you've been

09:11.551 --> 09:13.136
getting tattoos

09:13.178 --> 09:14.637
to help you remember things,

09:13.178 --> 09:14.637
like the guy in<i> Memento.</i>

09:14.679 --> 09:15.972
Again, haven't seen it.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.682
No, the tattoos

09:16.014 --> 09:17.682
could be clues

09:17.724 --> 09:18.725
that you're leaving

09:17.724 --> 09:18.725
for yourself.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.310
Here, we'll step out.

09:20.352 --> 09:21.728
You get undressed and write

09:20.352 --> 09:21.728
down everything you see,

09:21.769 --> 09:23.730
-and you're fully naked.

09:21.769 --> 09:23.730
-Hey-oh!

09:23.771 --> 09:25.565
All right, well,

09:23.771 --> 09:25.565
I guess we're looking

09:23.771 --> 09:25.565
at 'em together.

09:25.606 --> 09:26.691
[Brad]

09:25.606 --> 09:26.691
Hello, squad.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.693
My name is

09:26.733 --> 09:28.693
Brad Portenberg,

09:28.735 --> 09:31.905
and today I'm gonna

09:28.735 --> 09:31.905
teach you about

09:28.735 --> 09:31.905
workplace conflict.

09:31.946 --> 09:35.450
So I brought along

09:31.946 --> 09:35.450
someone who's an

09:31.946 --> 09:35.450
expert in conflict:

09:35.492 --> 09:37.118
my ex-wife.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.081
Just kidding.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.081
She lives in Vermont

09:38.912 --> 09:41.081
with our kids.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.750
So can anyone tell me

09:41.122 --> 09:43.750
what a stereotype is?

09:43.791 --> 09:45.502
The Irish are

09:43.791 --> 09:45.502
potato-eating drunks.

09:45.544 --> 09:46.878
-And the gays--

09:45.544 --> 09:46.878
-No, no, no.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.214
What does the word

09:46.920 --> 09:49.214
"stereotype"<i> mean?</i>

09:49.256 --> 09:51.299
-Uh...

09:49.256 --> 09:51.299
-I got this, fellas.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.927
It's a preconceived,

09:51.341 --> 09:53.927
often prejudiced notion

09:51.341 --> 09:53.927
about a group of people.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.929
Great, and can anyone

09:53.968 --> 09:55.929
tell me what a protected

09:53.968 --> 09:55.929
class is?

09:55.970 --> 09:58.014
A group of people

09:55.970 --> 09:58.014
with a common

09:55.970 --> 09:58.014
characteristic

09:58.056 --> 10:00.016
that is legally protected

09:58.056 --> 10:00.016
from employment

09:58.056 --> 10:00.016
discrimination.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.309
And how many protected

10:00.058 --> 10:01.309
classes are there?

10:01.351 --> 10:02.977
-Twenty.

10:01.351 --> 10:02.977
-Wow.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.730
It seems like

10:03.019 --> 10:05.730
I have myself

10:03.019 --> 10:05.730
a star pupil.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.190
Honey, you have no idea.

10:07.232 --> 10:09.401
"Extra ranch, no tomato,

10:07.232 --> 10:09.401
no cilantro."

10:09.443 --> 10:11.027
These are just a list

10:09.443 --> 10:11.027
of modifications

10:11.069 --> 10:12.529
on a signature salad

10:11.069 --> 10:12.529
from Panera.

10:12.571 --> 10:15.365
Okay, this one says,

10:12.571 --> 10:15.365
"Buy toilet paper"

10:15.407 --> 10:17.700
in a truly gigantic font.

10:17.742 --> 10:18.993
I hate to think

10:17.742 --> 10:18.993
of the horrific event

10:19.035 --> 10:20.703
that led to a reminder

10:19.035 --> 10:20.703
of this size.

10:20.745 --> 10:24.249
This says your

10:20.745 --> 10:24.249
bank account

10:20.745 --> 10:24.249
number is 432211378,

10:24.291 --> 10:25.750
then just under that,

10:25.792 --> 10:27.210
"Someone saw this

10:25.792 --> 10:27.210
and stole your money."

10:27.252 --> 10:28.669
-Aw.

10:27.252 --> 10:28.669
-Ew. [scoffs]

10:28.711 --> 10:30.547
This just says,

10:28.711 --> 10:30.547
"Don't trust your D"?

10:30.589 --> 10:32.424
Okay, well,

10:30.589 --> 10:32.424
that's good advice.

10:32.466 --> 10:33.967
My D does get me

10:32.466 --> 10:33.967
in a lot of trouble.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.802
Are you sure that's what

10:34.008 --> 10:35.802
the D stands for?

10:35.843 --> 10:37.596
Oh, it's for sure

10:35.843 --> 10:37.596
my dong.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.348
It could tell some stories:

10:37.637 --> 10:40.348
Costa Rica in '98, 'Nam.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.766
-It's coming up.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.766
-[high-pitched beeping]

10:41.808 --> 10:43.393
Oh, no, there's a bomb

10:41.808 --> 10:43.393
in my chest!

10:43.435 --> 10:44.978
Save yourselves!

10:45.019 --> 10:46.605
No, no, no, no, it's just

10:45.019 --> 10:46.605
your little watch, okay?

10:46.646 --> 10:48.022
Means it's time for you

10:46.646 --> 10:48.022
to take your pills.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.399
You keep them in

10:48.064 --> 10:49.399
your right coat pocket.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.610
Oh, okay.

10:51.651 --> 10:52.986
-Where's my coat?

10:51.651 --> 10:52.986
-It's down in my car.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.488
Ah, I'll go get it.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.488
You stay here.

10:54.529 --> 10:55.822
No, no, no!

10:54.529 --> 10:55.822
Your penis is out.

10:55.863 --> 10:57.782
-I'll go.

10:55.863 --> 10:57.782
-Okay.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.701
Whew, boy, I love

10:57.824 --> 11:00.701
that little guy, right?

11:00.743 --> 11:01.786
Yeah.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.079
[cell phone rings]

11:03.121 --> 11:04.331
Oh, my phone's ringing.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.331
Gotta grab it.

11:04.372 --> 11:05.706
-It's Amy.

11:04.372 --> 11:05.706
-Aw, Ames!

11:05.748 --> 11:06.707
Put her on FaceTime.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.376
[scoffing]

11:06.749 --> 11:08.376
Wha-- No!

11:08.418 --> 11:10.420
-Come on!

11:08.418 --> 11:10.420
-Hey, what's going on?

11:10.462 --> 11:12.046
Hey, just checking in.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.632
How's it going with Charles?

11:13.672 --> 11:15.425
I know how hard

11:13.672 --> 11:15.425
this is for you.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.510
Have you told him anything?

11:16.551 --> 11:17.676
Nope, we're still all good.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.304
He has no idea that we are

11:19.346 --> 11:21.055
growing a Whomping Willow

11:19.346 --> 11:21.055
in your Chamber of Secrets.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.932
Well, I have to get back

11:21.097 --> 11:22.932
to the seminar.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.767
Also, you've

11:22.974 --> 11:24.767
ruined sex forever.

11:24.809 --> 11:26.520
Yep, I heard it.

11:24.809 --> 11:26.520
I don't know why

11:24.809 --> 11:26.520
I keep doing it.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.438
I love you. Bye.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.438
[sighs]

11:28.480 --> 11:29.730
What was all that about?

11:29.772 --> 11:31.525
Oh, I actually

11:29.772 --> 11:31.525
really can't tell you.

11:31.566 --> 11:33.151
No, wait a minute,

11:31.566 --> 11:33.151
you're the only person

11:33.193 --> 11:34.528
that I can tell because

11:33.193 --> 11:34.528
your brain's broken.

11:34.569 --> 11:35.987
Anything I say,

11:34.569 --> 11:35.987
you'll just forget.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.238
Well, I guess that's true.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.238
Give it to me.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.115
Amy and I are trying

11:37.280 --> 11:39.115
to have a baby.

11:39.157 --> 11:42.827
What? Jake,

11:39.157 --> 11:42.827
that's wonderful!

11:39.157 --> 11:42.827
Come on, bring it in.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.579
I'd rather not,

11:42.869 --> 11:44.579
but it still feels

11:42.869 --> 11:44.579
really nice

11:44.621 --> 11:46.122
to talk to someone

11:44.621 --> 11:46.122
about it finally,

11:46.164 --> 11:48.041
that I'm gonna be a dad!

11:46.164 --> 11:48.041
It's so crazy.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.584
Hey, don't mention this

11:48.082 --> 11:49.584
around Charles.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.336
[screams]

11:49.626 --> 11:51.336
Where am I?

11:51.378 --> 11:52.879
Oh, perfect.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.340
Listen, Denise,

11:52.920 --> 11:55.340
I felt personally attacked

11:55.382 --> 11:57.592
when you included

11:55.382 --> 11:57.592
sesame bagels

11:55.382 --> 11:57.592
at the bagel brunch

11:57.634 --> 11:59.010
knowing full well

11:57.634 --> 11:59.010
I'm allergic.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.262
-I developed a rash.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.262
-Says you, Ainsley.

12:01.304 --> 12:03.348
I believe food allergies

12:01.304 --> 12:03.348
are a hoax.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.142
Perhaps your rash

12:03.390 --> 12:06.142
is from all that makeup

12:03.390 --> 12:06.142
you wear.

12:06.184 --> 12:10.564
-This is an office,

12:06.184 --> 12:10.564
not some downtown dancery.

12:06.184 --> 12:10.564
-[Brad] Okay,

12:10.605 --> 12:13.732
great. Now, in this role play,

12:10.605 --> 12:13.732
who can tell me what went wrong?

12:13.774 --> 12:15.610
Denise should have

12:13.774 --> 12:15.610
made reasonable

12:13.774 --> 12:15.610
accommodations

12:15.652 --> 12:17.070
given Ainsley's

12:15.652 --> 12:17.070
medical issue.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.988
Ainsley unnecessarily

12:17.111 --> 12:18.988
heightened the conflict

12:19.030 --> 12:20.823
by assuming that Denise

12:19.030 --> 12:20.823
had a personal vendetta,

12:20.865 --> 12:22.534
and Denise shouldn't

12:20.865 --> 12:22.534
have responded

12:22.576 --> 12:24.077
to Ainsley's complaint

12:22.576 --> 12:24.077
with an<i> ad hominem</i> attack.

12:24.118 --> 12:25.579
-My thoughts exactly.

12:24.118 --> 12:25.579
-I concur.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.622
-Yep.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.622
-Wow.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.541
I'm really disappointed...

12:29.583 --> 12:31.750
that I have nothing

12:29.583 --> 12:31.750
to correct you on!

12:31.792 --> 12:33.253
That was amazing!

12:33.294 --> 12:34.795
I have never had

12:33.294 --> 12:34.795
a group finish

12:34.837 --> 12:36.923
this entire seminar

12:34.837 --> 12:36.923
that quickly before.

12:36.964 --> 12:39.300
It reminds me of

12:36.964 --> 12:39.300
a really funny joke about--

12:39.342 --> 12:40.594
Ha, ha, I'm laughing already.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.387
Great seminar,

12:40.635 --> 12:42.387
sad it's over,

12:42.429 --> 12:43.597
but it is, so see ya.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.348
[Brad]

12:43.638 --> 12:45.348
Actually, I have good news.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.183
State law requires

12:45.390 --> 12:47.183
that this seminar

12:47.225 --> 12:48.643
be no less than six hours,

12:48.685 --> 12:50.811
so I guess we'll spend

12:48.685 --> 12:50.811
the next two hours

12:50.853 --> 12:52.355
diving into specific conflicts

12:52.397 --> 12:54.691
about this workplace

12:52.397 --> 12:54.691
and solving them.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.150
But we beat you.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.402
We beat you with study.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.237
Brad, my funny friend,

12:59.279 --> 13:00.697
we don't need

12:59.279 --> 13:00.697
this training.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.365
We don't have any

13:00.739 --> 13:02.365
workplace conflicts.

13:02.407 --> 13:05.619
Oh, there's always

13:02.407 --> 13:05.619
conflict somewhere.

13:05.660 --> 13:09.414
Now, it could be something

13:05.660 --> 13:09.414
small, like a pet peeve, or--

13:09.456 --> 13:12.083
Hitchcock slept with

13:09.456 --> 13:12.083
my wife, Kelly, in 1988!

13:12.125 --> 13:16.003
So Kelly was his<i> wife...</i>

13:12.125 --> 13:16.003
not his dog.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.048
Hey, before Charles

13:17.171 --> 13:19.048
gets back,

13:19.090 --> 13:20.508
there's a few more

13:19.090 --> 13:20.508
secrets I want to say

13:19.090 --> 13:20.508
out loud to someone

13:20.550 --> 13:21.760
who will immediately

13:20.550 --> 13:21.760
forget them.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.303
-Give 'em to me.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.303
-In 11th grade,

13:23.344 --> 13:25.096
I told everyone I was

13:23.344 --> 13:25.096
going to a Megadeth concert,

13:25.138 --> 13:27.014
but it was actually

13:25.138 --> 13:27.014
Melissa Etheridge,

13:25.138 --> 13:27.014
and I loved it.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.849
Also, one time,

13:27.056 --> 13:28.849
I ate a dog biscuit

13:28.891 --> 13:30.143
just to see

13:28.891 --> 13:30.143
what it tasted like.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.686
I get it.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.686
They're delicious.

13:31.728 --> 13:32.729
They're not bad.

13:32.771 --> 13:34.105
Oh, here comes Charles.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.565
Hey, man, did you get

13:34.147 --> 13:35.565
Pimento's meds?

13:35.607 --> 13:37.150
-Sure did.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.150
-Aw, thanks, Chuck.

13:37.191 --> 13:40.153
See, this is gonna make

13:37.191 --> 13:40.153
me feel a lot better.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.489
I grabbed you a water

13:40.194 --> 13:42.489
from the hospital to

13:40.194 --> 13:42.489
wash 'em down.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.115
Aw, thanks, Jake.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.575
You're gonna

13:44.157 --> 13:45.575
make a good dad.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.744
I'm so glad you and Amy

13:45.617 --> 13:47.744
are taking that step.

13:47.786 --> 13:49.287
[Jake] What?!

13:47.786 --> 13:49.287
How did you--

13:49.329 --> 13:51.331
What about

13:49.329 --> 13:51.331
your memory reset?

13:51.372 --> 13:52.999
You and Amy are

13:51.372 --> 13:52.999
trying to have a baby

13:53.040 --> 13:55.627
and you told Pimento

13:53.040 --> 13:55.627
and not me?

13:55.669 --> 13:57.378
They've got a

13:55.669 --> 13:57.378
Panera here?

13:57.420 --> 14:00.839
Okay. I love their salads

13:57.420 --> 14:00.839
exactly as they come.

14:00.881 --> 14:03.092
-Actually, you don't.

14:00.881 --> 14:03.092
-Thanks, Jakey.

14:03.134 --> 14:06.262
See? You're gonna

14:03.134 --> 14:06.262
make a great dad.

14:06.304 --> 14:07.722
Stop saying that!

14:09.432 --> 14:10.975
Hey.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.644
So you wanna talk about

14:11.017 --> 14:12.644
what happened before?

14:12.686 --> 14:14.187
You mean the "you telling

14:12.686 --> 14:14.187
Pimento and not me

14:14.228 --> 14:15.854
that you're trying

14:14.228 --> 14:15.854
to make a baby" thing?

14:15.896 --> 14:17.982
[giggles, stammers]

14:15.896 --> 14:17.982
No, no, I'm totally fine.

14:18.024 --> 14:21.611
Hey, coffee guy,

14:18.024 --> 14:21.611
how would you like be

14:18.024 --> 14:21.611
godfather to my son?

14:21.653 --> 14:23.237
Because the position

14:21.653 --> 14:23.237
just opened up.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.947
Okay, we're talking

14:23.279 --> 14:24.947
about this.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.200
Look, you're

14:24.989 --> 14:27.200
being unfair.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.828
There's some things in my life

14:27.241 --> 14:29.828
with Amy that are just between

14:27.241 --> 14:29.828
her and me,

14:29.869 --> 14:31.371
and I need you

14:29.869 --> 14:31.371
to be okay with that.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.540
Fine. You're right.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.540
I get it.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.958
I mean, it's not like

14:33.581 --> 14:35.958
you told anyone else.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.002
Right.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.338
I mean...

14:40.380 --> 14:41.715
we told Rosa.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.174
Rosa?! That do--

14:43.216 --> 14:44.384
Oh, why her and not me?

14:44.425 --> 14:46.093
Sometimes you can

14:44.425 --> 14:46.093
be a little much.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.555
A little much?

14:46.135 --> 14:48.555
A little much!

14:48.596 --> 14:50.097
Yes, a little much.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.642
Well, maybe, Jake,

14:50.139 --> 14:52.642
I have Finding Dory

14:50.139 --> 14:52.642
Disease too,

14:52.684 --> 14:56.270
because right now,

14:52.684 --> 14:56.270
I can't remember why

14:52.684 --> 14:56.270
we ever were friends!

14:56.312 --> 14:59.023
Okay, see, once again,

14:56.312 --> 14:59.023
that was a little

14:56.312 --> 14:59.023
over the top.

14:59.065 --> 15:02.485
Excuse me, my godson's dad.

14:59.065 --> 15:02.485
The crazy guy just ran away.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.779
Oh, my God, he's gone.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.779
Pimento is gone.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.823
-Just like our friendship!

15:04.821 --> 15:06.823
-Come on, Charles.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.949
[Holt] Well, I've got

15:06.865 --> 15:08.949
a bean to boil too.

15:08.991 --> 15:11.745
Santiago always tries

15:08.991 --> 15:11.745
to finish my sentences

15:11.786 --> 15:13.037
and frequently gets it wrong.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.081
I do not,

15:13.079 --> 15:15.081
and I am not wrong.

15:15.122 --> 15:17.417
-You do it all the--

15:15.122 --> 15:17.417
-Time?

15:17.458 --> 15:20.336
No, I was going to say,

15:17.458 --> 15:20.336
"All the day long."

15:20.378 --> 15:21.713
See? Frequently wrong.

15:21.755 --> 15:24.424
I dog-sat for Scully,

15:21.755 --> 15:24.424
and he never thanked me.

15:24.465 --> 15:27.301
-Kelly was a real handful!

15:24.465 --> 15:27.301
-[Terry] Wait, I'm confused

15:24.465 --> 15:27.301
again.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.554
-Kelly<i> was</i> a dog?

15:27.343 --> 15:29.554
-[Scully] There were

15:27.343 --> 15:29.554
two Kellys.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.181
You'd know that if

15:29.596 --> 15:32.181
you'd ever listened

15:29.596 --> 15:32.181
to my podcast!

15:32.223 --> 15:34.517
-Okay, dude, just relax.

15:32.223 --> 15:34.517
-Don't tell us to relax

15:34.559 --> 15:36.853
just because you're

15:34.559 --> 15:36.853
too nice to have any

15:34.559 --> 15:36.853
pet peeves.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.730
Oh, Terry's got peeves.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.940
Terry hates the way

15:38.772 --> 15:40.940
you always make mouth

15:38.772 --> 15:40.940
noises when you eat.

15:40.981 --> 15:43.902
"Nyum, nyum. I'm Rosa.

15:40.981 --> 15:43.902
I'm eating a croissant.

15:40.981 --> 15:43.902
Nyum, nyum."

15:43.943 --> 15:45.737
How's this for a mouth noise?

15:43.943 --> 15:45.737
You suck.

15:45.779 --> 15:46.821
No, you suck!

15:46.863 --> 15:48.615
As do you,

15:46.863 --> 15:48.615
as do you and you!

15:48.656 --> 15:50.658
Oh, yeah? Well,

15:48.656 --> 15:50.658
you're all a

15:48.656 --> 15:50.658
bunch of flopes!

15:50.700 --> 15:52.326
-This is a flope right here!

15:50.700 --> 15:52.326
-Flopes?!

15:52.368 --> 15:55.580
[all shouting over each other]

15:55.622 --> 15:56.790
Okay, all right!

15:56.831 --> 15:59.584
Okay, guys!

15:56.831 --> 15:59.584
That is our six hours.

15:59.626 --> 16:03.129
The seminar is over,

15:59.626 --> 16:03.129
I'm really proud of you guys.

16:03.170 --> 16:06.507
Lots of good progress

16:03.170 --> 16:06.507
here today. You're welcome.

16:06.549 --> 16:09.176
Excuse me, I'm Detective Boyle.

16:06.549 --> 16:09.176
This is my partner, Jake.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.679
You probably think it's weird

16:09.218 --> 16:11.679
that I said partner

16:09.218 --> 16:11.679
and not friend.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.013
-Not at all.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.013
-Well, the point is

16:13.055 --> 16:14.849
that we're strictly

16:13.055 --> 16:14.849
colleagues.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.392
Have you seen this man?

16:16.434 --> 16:18.478
Yeah, he was here a few

16:16.434 --> 16:18.478
hours ago for a new tattoo.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.688
It was supposed to say,

16:18.519 --> 16:20.688
"Jake and Amy are trying

16:18.519 --> 16:20.688
to have a baby."

16:20.730 --> 16:22.398
-Seriously?

16:20.730 --> 16:22.398
-Aw.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.024
Wait a minute,

16:22.440 --> 16:24.024
what do you mean

16:22.440 --> 16:24.024
"supposed to"?

16:24.066 --> 16:25.610
He jumped out of the chair

16:24.066 --> 16:25.610
before I could finish.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.445
Second time it's happened.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.445
First time,

16:27.487 --> 16:28.863
he left with a tat that said,

16:27.487 --> 16:28.863
"Don't trust your D."

16:28.905 --> 16:30.531
-That wasn't the whole tattoo?

16:28.905 --> 16:30.531
-No.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.659
He wanted it to say,

16:30.573 --> 16:32.659
"Don't trust your doctor."

16:32.700 --> 16:35.829
Oh, my God.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.829
Pimento's doctor

16:32.700 --> 16:35.829
is trying to kill him.

16:35.870 --> 16:38.080
He must have remembered

16:35.870 --> 16:38.080
something when he stopped

16:35.870 --> 16:38.080
taking his pills.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.791
The pills are what's

16:38.122 --> 16:39.791
messing with his memory.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.417
We have to find him

16:39.833 --> 16:41.417
before his doctor does.

16:41.459 --> 16:42.877
-Oh, I know where he's going.

16:41.459 --> 16:42.877
-You do? Where?

16:42.919 --> 16:44.128
Said he's going

16:42.919 --> 16:44.128
to his doctor.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.713
Oh.

16:46.881 --> 16:48.132
Thanks.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.302
Detectives, good

16:49.175 --> 16:51.302
to see you again.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.179
Oh, I see, the villain

16:51.344 --> 16:53.179
playing it cool

16:53.220 --> 16:54.848
when confronted

16:53.220 --> 16:54.848
by the good guys,

16:54.889 --> 16:57.350
just like Javier Bardem

16:54.889 --> 16:57.350
in<i> No Country for Old Men.</i>

16:59.101 --> 17:01.395
Do you guys<i> only</i> watch

16:59.101 --> 17:01.395
kids' movies?

17:01.437 --> 17:04.398
Whatever you're insinuating,

17:01.437 --> 17:04.398
I assure you,

17:01.437 --> 17:04.398
you're incorrect.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.984
Cut the crap, Doc.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.984
We know everything.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.027
[Jake] That's right,

17:06.025 --> 17:08.027
your wife hired Pimento

17:08.068 --> 17:09.863
as a PI to find out if

17:08.068 --> 17:09.863
you were cheating on her

17:09.904 --> 17:12.114
with your spin class

17:09.904 --> 17:12.114
instructor, Kendra.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.325
[Charles] And you were,

17:12.156 --> 17:14.325
so you silenced Pimento

17:14.367 --> 17:16.828
before he could tell her

17:14.367 --> 17:16.828
by drugging him

17:14.367 --> 17:16.828
to ruin his memory.

17:16.870 --> 17:18.538
-Now, where is he?

17:16.870 --> 17:18.538
-I haven't seen him.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.373
Oh, please, you're making

17:18.579 --> 17:20.373
this way too easy.

17:20.414 --> 17:21.666
You clearly just glanced

17:20.414 --> 17:21.666
at this door.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.001
No, don't.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.001
He's not in there!

17:23.042 --> 17:24.460
Oh, really?

17:23.042 --> 17:24.460
Because I'm pretty sure

17:24.502 --> 17:26.420
that he...

17:24.502 --> 17:26.420
isn't.

17:26.462 --> 17:27.463
But he clearly was.

17:27.505 --> 17:29.382
[Pimento]

17:27.505 --> 17:29.382
Jake, help!

17:29.423 --> 17:30.633
Pimento!

17:30.675 --> 17:33.344
<i>[exciting music]</i>

17:33.386 --> 17:34.846
[Charles] Got 'im!

17:34.888 --> 17:36.222
[Pimento]

17:34.888 --> 17:36.222
Help!

17:36.263 --> 17:37.223
Jake, what's happening?

17:37.264 --> 17:38.516
What is this ledge?

17:38.558 --> 17:40.184
You must have tried

17:38.558 --> 17:40.184
to escape out the window

17:40.226 --> 17:41.728
and then your

17:40.226 --> 17:41.728
memory reset!

17:41.769 --> 17:42.937
What?

17:41.769 --> 17:42.937
I don't understand!

17:42.979 --> 17:44.480
Why would my

17:42.979 --> 17:44.480
memory reset?

17:44.522 --> 17:47.692
It's just like the film...

17:47.734 --> 17:49.235
<i>Finding Dory.</i>

17:49.276 --> 17:51.487
-Huh?

17:49.276 --> 17:51.487
-<i> Finding Dory.</i>

17:51.529 --> 17:54.032
Ah, say no more!

17:51.529 --> 17:54.032
I completely understand!

17:54.073 --> 17:55.783
Just stay where you are.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.783
I'm gonna come get you.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.076
Okay!

17:57.117 --> 17:58.327
Should I go over here?

17:58.369 --> 17:59.662
No! Why would you

17:58.369 --> 17:59.662
go over there?!

17:59.704 --> 18:00.830
I don't know!

18:00.872 --> 18:02.540
I just woke up out here!

18:02.582 --> 18:03.666
Just stay still!

18:03.708 --> 18:05.376
Aah, I don't know

18:03.708 --> 18:05.376
what to do!

18:05.418 --> 18:06.460
Okay, all right.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.671
Here I come. Here I come.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.172
Ohh. I'm scared

18:08.713 --> 18:10.172
of heights, Jake.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.258
Yeah, so am I, Adrian.

18:12.299 --> 18:14.134
This might not be

18:12.299 --> 18:14.134
the time to tell you,

18:14.176 --> 18:16.512
but both my parents died

18:14.176 --> 18:16.512
falling out of lighthouses--

18:16.554 --> 18:17.805
separate incidents.

18:17.847 --> 18:19.139
Oh, man, I have

18:17.847 --> 18:19.139
so many questions,

18:19.181 --> 18:21.141
but for now,

18:19.181 --> 18:21.141
just follow my lead, okay?

18:21.183 --> 18:22.142
Okay.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.227
Take small

18:22.184 --> 18:23.227
little baby steps,

18:23.269 --> 18:24.604
like this.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.190
-You're not moving!

18:26.105 --> 18:28.190
-I'm not?

18:28.983 --> 18:30.484
Ohh... uh-oh!

18:30.526 --> 18:32.319
This is bad.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.531
Ohh. I'm really

18:34.113 --> 18:35.531
scared, Jake.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.700
-I'm<i> really</i> scared.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.700
-Yeah, I know,

18:37.742 --> 18:40.453
just try and look at one thing

18:37.742 --> 18:40.453
and focus only on that

18:40.494 --> 18:42.121
until I can get Charles

18:40.494 --> 18:42.121
out here to help.

18:42.162 --> 18:43.748
Okay, okay. Ooh!

18:43.790 --> 18:45.583
There's a juicy

18:43.790 --> 18:45.583
old person butt

18:43.790 --> 18:45.583
in that window.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.668
Why's it gotta be

18:45.625 --> 18:47.668
juicy<i> and</i> old?

18:47.710 --> 18:49.963
I don't know,

18:47.710 --> 18:49.963
but I'm grateful for it.

18:50.004 --> 18:51.422
All right, just

18:50.004 --> 18:51.422
lock in on that.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.507
Hey, Charles! I know

18:51.464 --> 18:53.507
you're still mad at me

18:53.549 --> 18:54.801
for not telling you

18:53.549 --> 18:54.801
Amy and I are trying,

18:54.842 --> 18:56.302
but I could really

18:54.842 --> 18:56.302
use your help.

18:56.343 --> 18:57.762
That's not all

18:56.343 --> 18:57.762
I'm mad about, Jake.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.597
I'm upset because

18:57.804 --> 18:59.597
you keep blowing me off.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.474
We haven't hung

18:59.639 --> 19:01.474
out in weeks!

19:01.515 --> 19:03.350
We don't talk

19:01.515 --> 19:03.350
on the phone anymore.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.352
I can't remember the last time

19:03.392 --> 19:05.352
we painted pottery together.

19:05.394 --> 19:08.106
Sorry, I know this isn't

19:05.394 --> 19:08.106
the time to talk about this.

19:08.188 --> 19:09.607
[Jake]

19:08.188 --> 19:09.607
No, no, no, keep going.

19:09.649 --> 19:10.900
It's helping to distract

19:09.649 --> 19:10.900
me from the fact

19:10.942 --> 19:12.568
that I could fall

19:10.942 --> 19:12.568
and instantly die.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.403
Oh, no, from this height,

19:12.610 --> 19:14.403
it wouldn't be instant.

19:14.445 --> 19:16.823
When you hit the ground,

19:14.445 --> 19:16.823
your ribs would shatter,

19:16.864 --> 19:18.658
puncturing your lungs.

19:18.699 --> 19:21.619
You'd start to drown on

19:18.699 --> 19:21.619
your own blood, gurgling and--

19:21.661 --> 19:23.830
Okay, Adrian, I'm being

19:21.661 --> 19:23.830
distracted by Charles

19:21.661 --> 19:23.830
right now, thank you.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.165
-Okay.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.165
-[Charles] Here!

19:23.871 --> 19:26.165
Take--take my hand.

19:26.206 --> 19:27.500
I can guide you guys back.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.919
Come on, we're a chain.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.919
Here we go.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.671
-Just keep swimmin'.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.671
-Oh, just keep swimming!

19:31.712 --> 19:33.297
-Just keep swimming.

19:31.712 --> 19:33.297
-Oh, say it, Jake.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.508
[quietly]

19:34.256 --> 19:35.508
Just keep swimming.

19:35.549 --> 19:36.592
-[Charles] Good.

19:35.549 --> 19:36.592
-[Pimento] Oh!

19:36.634 --> 19:38.136
[Jake]

19:36.634 --> 19:38.136
Hey, just so you know,

19:38.177 --> 19:39.512
the only reason that

19:38.177 --> 19:39.512
I've been avoiding you

19:39.553 --> 19:40.721
is because I really

19:39.553 --> 19:40.721
wanted to tell you

19:40.763 --> 19:42.056
what me and Amy

19:40.763 --> 19:42.056
have been up to,

19:42.098 --> 19:43.141
and I knew the second

19:42.098 --> 19:43.141
that I saw you,

19:43.182 --> 19:44.183
I would just blurt it out.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.476
I always tell

19:44.224 --> 19:45.476
you everything.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.061
I hated not being able

19:45.518 --> 19:47.061
to say anything.

19:47.103 --> 19:48.562
[Pimento]

19:47.103 --> 19:48.562
Aw, that's so sweet.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.482
Your love for each other

19:48.604 --> 19:51.482
is really wonderful.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.359
Let's hug.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.359
Let's all hug.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.360
No, no, no!

19:53.400 --> 19:54.360
We're still on the ledge!

19:54.401 --> 19:55.778
[all scream]

20:01.826 --> 20:04.037
[Amy]

20:01.826 --> 20:04.037
[sighs] Okay, this sucks.

20:04.078 --> 20:06.706
We never fight,

20:04.078 --> 20:06.706
and then stupid

20:04.078 --> 20:06.706
Brad comes in

20:06.747 --> 20:08.290
and turns us all

20:06.747 --> 20:08.290
against each other

20:08.332 --> 20:09.876
and now we're acting

20:08.332 --> 20:09.876
like a bunch of kids.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.836
Not all kids. My girls

20:09.917 --> 20:11.836
never act like this.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.337
[Holt]

20:11.878 --> 20:13.337
We may be arguing,

20:13.379 --> 20:15.006
but we're all thinking

20:13.379 --> 20:15.006
the same thing:

20:15.048 --> 20:16.841
Terry talks about

20:15.048 --> 20:16.841
his children too much.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.885
Do I really?

20:16.883 --> 20:18.885
You all think that?

20:18.926 --> 20:20.761
Keep a lid on

20:18.926 --> 20:20.761
the box, Pandora.

20:20.803 --> 20:22.596
-You won't like what's inside.

20:20.803 --> 20:22.596
-[Rosa] Everybody shut up.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.306
You're all acting

20:22.638 --> 20:24.306
like a bunch of Ramonas.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.142
-Ramona?

20:24.348 --> 20:26.142
-Yeah, she hated the smell

20:26.184 --> 20:28.144
of her coworker's holiday

20:26.184 --> 20:28.144
candle, so she threw it out.

20:28.186 --> 20:29.896
It was in that thing

20:28.186 --> 20:29.896
that you made us

20:28.186 --> 20:29.896
memorize.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.564
You memorized it?

20:31.605 --> 20:33.566
But you said it was homework

20:31.605 --> 20:33.566
and you don't do homework.

20:33.607 --> 20:35.442
Yeah, well, you said

20:33.607 --> 20:35.442
to read it, so I read it.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.944
We're a team... ya flope.

20:36.986 --> 20:39.822
-It's catching on.

20:36.986 --> 20:39.822
-Eh, I mean...

20:40.907 --> 20:42.950
Hey, guys, it's me,

20:40.907 --> 20:42.950
Adrian Pimento.

20:42.992 --> 20:44.911
Hey, Pimento!

20:42.992 --> 20:44.911
How's it goin', bud?

20:44.952 --> 20:46.787
Pretty good,

20:44.952 --> 20:46.787
I know where I am,

20:46.829 --> 20:49.623
and I know what a table is,

20:46.829 --> 20:49.623
so everything's going great.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.584
Pretty low bar for greatness,

20:49.665 --> 20:51.584
but all right.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.336
Hey, how's it been

20:51.625 --> 20:54.336
since you stopped

20:51.625 --> 20:54.336
taking those pills?

20:54.378 --> 20:57.381
Well, thankfully,

20:54.378 --> 20:57.381
my full memory

20:54.378 --> 20:57.381
has come back,

20:57.423 --> 20:59.633
even the things that haunt me.

21:01.969 --> 21:06.849
[laughing]

21:06.891 --> 21:08.976
[laughter continues]

21:09.018 --> 21:11.311
Hey, Jake, I saw

21:09.018 --> 21:11.311
that movie you keep

21:09.018 --> 21:11.311
talking about.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.981
You watched<i> Memento?</i>

21:11.353 --> 21:13.981
And? What'd you think?

21:14.023 --> 21:15.608
It's okay.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.576
<i>-Not a doctor.</i>

21:23.657 --> 21:25.576
-Shh.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.912
<i>-[laser pings]</i>

21:25.618 --> 21:27.912
<i>-Fremulon.</i>
