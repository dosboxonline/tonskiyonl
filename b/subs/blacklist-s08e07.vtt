00:01.001 --> 00:02.794
[narrator] <i>Previously on </i>The Blacklist:

00:02.877 --> 00:05.088
I'm not an errand boy.
I won't be ordered about.

00:05.588 --> 00:08.258
[Rakitin] We'd like you
to make this go away.

00:08.341 --> 00:09.592
[Sikorsky] We know about Keen.

00:09.676 --> 00:12.137
What she's saying, that you're N-13.

00:12.220 --> 00:15.557
[Raymond] Elizabeth's gone
and she's taken something of mine.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.017
[Cooper] I suppose you also think

00:17.100 --> 00:19.185
that she's responsible
for the Freelancer's release.

00:19.269 --> 00:22.021
-[Raymond] There's more to the story.
-Where is he?

00:22.105 --> 00:24.357
[Raymond] The work of a man
who disguises his killings

00:24.441 --> 00:26.860
in the headlines of everyday tragedies.

00:26.943 --> 00:29.779
[Cooper] The arrest that you made earlier,
Mason Dieterle.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.614
[Park] He burned down
my friend's restaurant.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.451
[Cooper] Just got off the phone with
the AUSA reviewing the case.

00:34.534 --> 00:38.163
He told me that your friend
passed away from her injuries.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.582
You promised me you wouldn't do anything.

00:40.665 --> 00:43.501
I need to know,
did you break that promise?

00:43.585 --> 00:46.087
[dramatic music playing]

00:46.171 --> 00:47.964
No, sir.

00:50.925 --> 00:54.679
We've been formulating those
binary structures you gave us.

00:55.513 --> 00:56.931
I think we've done it.

00:57.015 --> 00:59.601
We identified the exact structure
of the Novichok agent.

01:01.394 --> 01:04.773
Pig, hog, runt...

01:05.356 --> 01:06.566
sow...

01:07.442 --> 01:08.651
boar.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.738
My brother's mantra.

01:11.821 --> 01:14.491
When he was a boy,
he collected glass pigs.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.868
He knew everything there was
to know about them.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.497
-Which side-group is this?
-Ethoxy.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.291
It's more stable. Easier to spread.

01:23.374 --> 01:27.253
Harder to detect
and lethal when it contacts the skin.

01:31.674 --> 01:33.927
[pig squealing]

01:41.893 --> 01:44.395
[man] This is ten times more potent
than VX.

01:44.896 --> 01:48.108
If there's a deadlier nerve agent,
I'm not aware of it.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.026
Call our buyer in DurrÃ«s.

01:50.652 --> 01:55.281
Tell him the order's ready
and to expect delivery in 48 hours.

01:59.494 --> 02:05.333
Pig, hog, runt, sow, boar.

[pensive music playing]

02:21.099 --> 02:22.183
[chuckles]

02:25.103 --> 02:26.354
The road not taken.

02:27.438 --> 02:29.023
-Beauty school?
-Yes.

02:29.107 --> 02:34.612
That young woman's great passion that
her single father just can't understand.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.072
It pushes them apart.

02:36.948 --> 02:39.826
But instead of insisting
that she understand him,

02:39.909 --> 02:45.123
he enrolls in beauty school as well
and learns to better understand her.

02:45.915 --> 02:49.919
I think you understand Elizabeth,
probably more than you want to.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.673
Well, I'm not her father.

02:55.091 --> 02:58.803
Maybe if I were,
I'd want to understand her even better.

02:58.887 --> 03:01.014
Perhaps she wouldn't be
so determined to kill me.

03:01.097 --> 03:02.140
[knocking on door]

03:06.561 --> 03:08.021
-Morning.
-Good morning.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.314
Coffee?

03:09.397 --> 03:12.275
Please. Something smells delicious.

03:12.358 --> 03:17.113
Meat and potato pie.
Dembe brought it back from Sarajevo.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.490
You should try a slice.

03:20.533 --> 03:24.037
Like all good things,
it's sinfully bad for you.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.373
-You had a case?
-Yes, thanks to Dembe.

03:27.457 --> 03:30.209
He brought home more than Bosnian Burek.

03:30.793 --> 03:34.297
Elizabeth used an interpreter
to contract a bounty hunter.

03:34.881 --> 03:38.509
-I found him in Sarajevo.
-An effective chap of ill repute.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.387
Naturally, I assumed
the hunter's bounty was me.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.264
Unfortunately, I was mistaken.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.934
How is not being a target unfortunate?

03:46.017 --> 03:48.895
Because each time I think Elizabeth

03:48.978 --> 03:52.774
-won't go to a darker place, she does.
-Elizabeth wanted the bounty hunter

03:52.857 --> 03:55.318
-to kill someone else?
-Not kill. Find.

03:56.152 --> 03:57.737
Someone she wanted to work with.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.280
Why is that so dark?

03:59.364 --> 04:02.659
The person she's working with
brokers chemical weapons.

04:03.785 --> 04:04.827
I don't believe that.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.371
Her name is Mary Bremmer.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.624
-I'm not familiar with that name.
-[Raymond] Neither was I.

04:09.707 --> 04:12.460
The bounty hunter
was unable to locate her,

04:12.543 --> 04:14.629
but he put together
a dossier for Elizabeth.

04:14.712 --> 04:16.089
Dembe got a copy of it.

04:16.172 --> 04:17.465
Why would she do this?

04:17.548 --> 04:21.135
The same reason she worked to get
the Freelancer released from prison.

04:21.219 --> 04:22.971
-You don't know that she did that.
-No.

04:23.054 --> 04:27.058
But I know her endgame,
to break me and then kill me.

04:27.141 --> 04:30.520
I think it's safe to assume
she's using the Freelancer

04:30.603 --> 04:32.981
and Chemical Mary to accomplish that.

04:33.064 --> 04:36.192
You think she's in business
with a mass murderer and a war criminal?

04:38.027 --> 04:41.823
As I said, it's all... quite unfortunate.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.910
On the bright side,
I'm going to have a meeting

04:45.994 --> 04:48.162
with the Freelancer's
expensive new attorney.

04:48.246 --> 04:53.334
Word on the street is that his client has
acquired identity papers, passports,

04:53.418 --> 04:54.752
<i>and that he's back to work.</i>

04:54.836 --> 04:56.296
[in French] I have the flight deck.

04:56.379 --> 05:00.174
[Raymond] <i>I want to know what he's doing.</i>
<i>We'll see what his attorney says.</i>

05:00.925 --> 05:02.343
The dossier on Bremmer.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.929
It's incomplete
but it should give you a head start.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.973
[dramatic music playing]

05:11.019 --> 05:12.312
[cell phone rings]

05:12.395 --> 05:13.646
[in English] Not a good time.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.315
I'm doing it now.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.067
This is it, Agent Keen.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.571
Once your target is eliminated,
you and I are even.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.246
[emotional music playing]

05:31.331 --> 05:35.585
What you're doing is wrong.
You're only making things worse for Keen.

05:35.668 --> 05:39.839
Agent Park, you can rest assured,
I've heard it all before.

05:40.673 --> 05:43.718
It's a luxury to stand
on the moral high ground

05:43.801 --> 05:46.637
and critique those of us
on the low ground.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.931
A lot of people do exactly that...

05:50.224 --> 05:52.143
until they need my help.

05:53.352 --> 05:55.063
I'll never ask for your help.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.608
[Aram] Mr. Cooper called.
We have got a case.

05:58.691 --> 05:59.942
Okay.

06:01.235 --> 06:02.528
Oh. Uh...

06:04.072 --> 06:05.656
Is that about your friend?

06:07.492 --> 06:08.785
I'm so sorry.

06:09.827 --> 06:10.912
Me too.

06:10.995 --> 06:13.498
It sounded like it might have been arson.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.584
-Not "might." It was.
-Are there suspects?

06:16.667 --> 06:18.419
[dramatic music playing]

06:21.798 --> 06:23.591
There was, but he disappeared.

06:24.133 --> 06:27.804
Have you talked to Mr. Reddington?
I mean, he can find anyone.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.139
In this case, it might help, right?

06:30.723 --> 06:35.770
I mean, if he found the arsonist, justice,
scales, balancing, that kind of thing.

06:35.853 --> 06:38.648
But then on the down side,
you'd be in his debt and-- Ooh.

06:39.524 --> 06:43.486
That's a record scratch through
your favorite song. Can you imagine?

06:44.403 --> 06:46.155
What was it you said earlier?

06:46.239 --> 06:48.407
That I'd never ask for your help.

06:48.491 --> 06:52.411
No, that couldn't be it.
I mean, the irony, it's crushing.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.123
No.

06:55.706 --> 06:56.707
I can't imagine.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.585
Of course you can't.
This is horrendous advice,

06:59.669 --> 07:02.338
which you are clearly
way too smart to take.

07:02.421 --> 07:05.925
Anyway, I'm really sorry
about your friend.

07:13.599 --> 07:17.770
-Will you help?
-You're asking me to make it all go away?

07:20.273 --> 07:21.357
Say it.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.026
Make it go away.

07:24.110 --> 07:29.907
And if I do this, you're aware
I may someday ask for a favor in return.

07:32.577 --> 07:36.664
You may come to wish
you'd accepted the consequences

07:36.747 --> 07:39.417
of your actions here instead.

07:42.587 --> 07:43.588
Are we good?

07:45.673 --> 07:47.800
-He has a video of me on his phone.
-Ah-ah-ah.

07:48.342 --> 07:51.596
We'll take care of it,
like you were never here.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.481
Reddington refers to her as Chemical Mary.

08:02.190 --> 08:05.318
This ID is more than 15 years old
but it's the most recent photo we have.

08:05.401 --> 08:06.944
[Aram] What we know is this,

08:07.028 --> 08:09.697
Mary Bremmer is a former MIT professor
in Pathobiological Sciences

08:09.780 --> 08:12.450
who was fired for
ethical misconduct in '02.

08:12.533 --> 08:15.703
She questioned the appropriateness
of a chemical weapons ban,

08:15.786 --> 08:17.330
reasoning that if nuclear weapons

08:17.413 --> 08:20.124
are an acceptable deterrent to war,
why not sarin gas?

08:20.208 --> 08:24.128
There's a market for that kind of crazy.
I assume she's found a way to monetize it.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.379
Yeah, the CIA thinks so.

08:25.963 --> 08:28.257
According to Langley,
Bremmer supplied the weaponry

08:28.341 --> 08:31.093
for the chlorine car bomb massacre
in the Abu Sayda market.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.262
As for the assassination of Kim Jong-nam,

08:33.346 --> 08:35.932
Bremmer's role
is still being investigated.

08:36.724 --> 08:39.685
-I know it doesn't seem possible.
-Because it's not possible.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.854
Keen would never work
with someone like this.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.481
[Park] No, Agent Keen wouldn't.

08:43.564 --> 08:46.943
-But she's not an agent anymore.
-You don't know her.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.028
Maybe that's why
I can see what's going on.

08:49.111 --> 08:51.656
What's going on is hard on all of us.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.826
The only way to find out
what's happening is to find Keen.

08:55.910 --> 08:59.080
Finding Mary Bremmer
is our best hope of doing that.

08:59.163 --> 09:00.164
Okay.

09:00.248 --> 09:05.044
Intel placed Bremmer
in the Idlib province in 2013,

09:05.127 --> 09:07.547
supplying sarin to Assad forces.

09:07.630 --> 09:12.301
A NATO operation intercepted her convoy.
Bremmer's vehicle was overturned.

09:12.385 --> 09:16.430
The shipment was stopped. Bremmer
escaped and hasn't been seen since.

09:16.514 --> 09:22.395
Bremmer's security detail was killed,
except for one man, Ismael Aknoz.

09:22.478 --> 09:25.648
[Cooper] Aknoz refused to give
any information on Bremmer,

09:25.731 --> 09:29.777
<i>but after eight years of</i>
<i>isolation in an F-Type prison in Ankara,</i>

09:29.860 --> 09:31.571
<i>maybe he'll be ready to talk.</i>

09:38.953 --> 09:42.832
Ismael Aknoz? FBI. We'd like
to talk to you about Mary Bremmer.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.626
[in Turkish] Americans.

09:47.336 --> 09:48.337
Go home.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.970
-This has been productive.
-We know you speak English.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.347
[Aknoz in English]
You want Bremmer. So do I.

09:58.848 --> 10:02.226
Nothing would give me
more happiness than to see her dead.

10:02.310 --> 10:05.354
Help us find her
and we'd be happy to oblige you.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.316
-Why do you want to see her dead?
-What difference does it make?

10:08.399 --> 10:11.444
You were her partner in her convoy.
Why should we trust you?

10:12.028 --> 10:13.654
It's her fault I'm here.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.824
[Park] So she forced you
to transport chemical weapons?

10:16.907 --> 10:18.909
We did not know
they were chemical weapons.

10:18.993 --> 10:21.537
She told us we were
moving anti-tank missiles.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.665
She lied to you, which is why
you're gonna help us.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.459
Thank you. No.

10:26.542 --> 10:28.085
I hate her, yes.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.046
But Americans?

10:31.547 --> 10:32.715
I hate you more.

10:33.466 --> 10:37.094
We knew you spoke English because our
boss spoke with the Ministry of Justice.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.264
You work with us and they agree
to move you out of isolation.

10:40.348 --> 10:44.268
We're offering you a gift. No matter how
much you hate us, you should take it.

10:50.066 --> 10:53.736
Your allied forces,
they could have stopped us that day.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.237
Arrested us peacefully.

10:55.321 --> 11:00.701
Instead, they set up an ambush
with an IED and started shooting.

11:01.410 --> 11:05.039
Taking the weapons wasn't enough.
They wanted to make an example of us.

11:05.122 --> 11:09.377
And to do that,
they were willing to slaughter us.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.047
Take your gift and go.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.852
[dramatic music playing]

11:29.563 --> 11:30.731
[chuckles]

11:33.192 --> 11:35.403
-Who let you in here?
-Your assistant.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.405
Lovely fellow. Not very savvy.

11:37.488 --> 11:40.825
Probably not best utilized
as the gatekeeper.

11:40.908 --> 11:44.662
Perhaps better suited
to make coffee, chitchat.

11:44.745 --> 11:45.996
I know who you are.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.040
When you go on a business trip,

11:48.124 --> 11:50.584
do you charge by the hour
while you're on the plane,

11:50.668 --> 11:53.295
or in the car to the hotel?

11:53.379 --> 11:57.675
Or how about when you're enjoying
the adult entertainment in your room?

11:57.758 --> 12:01.679
Is your client paying
$1000 an hour for every hour

12:01.762 --> 12:03.848
or minute that you masturbate?

12:03.931 --> 12:07.101
My goodness,
and the world thinks I'm a criminal.

12:08.644 --> 12:12.148
-What do you want?
-For Dick the Butcher to have succeeded.

12:13.190 --> 12:17.236
<i>Henry IV, Part 2.</i>
Act four, scene two, you've heard it.

12:17.319 --> 12:20.614
"The first thing we do,
let's kill all the lawyers."

12:20.698 --> 12:24.785
You seem like an appropriately
loathsome place to start.

12:24.869 --> 12:28.038
Luckily for you, I want to know
where Alban Veseli is

12:28.122 --> 12:33.878
more than I want to sully my hands
or reputation by something so obvious

12:33.961 --> 12:36.005
as disposing of you.

12:37.465 --> 12:40.593
-I don't know where he is.
-But you know how to contact him.

12:40.676 --> 12:45.723
-How do I know you won't kill me?
-Because you still have a debt to repay.

12:45.806 --> 12:51.228
Elizabeth Keen paid you to represent
Veseli with money she stole from me.

12:51.729 --> 12:52.980
I want it back.

12:53.647 --> 12:57.568
-You want me to give you back my retainer.
-Plus interest.

12:57.651 --> 12:58.944
There's the phone.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.947
Tell Alban his life is in imminent danger,

13:02.031 --> 13:05.659
that you can't discuss it over the phone
and set a meeting.

13:05.743 --> 13:10.372
I think this qualifies as an emergency,
wouldn't you say, Scooter?

13:13.542 --> 13:16.754
We're jetlagged. Maybe
we're not making ourselves clear.

13:16.837 --> 13:19.340
-Aknoz was a dead end.
-I know he didn't say anything.

13:19.423 --> 13:21.425
What part of "dead end"
don't you understand?

13:21.509 --> 13:25.137
He may not have said anything,
but I think he told you a lot.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.347
You have something?

13:26.430 --> 13:29.225
I've been studying photos in the dossier.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.310
The bodies in the Humvee,

13:31.393 --> 13:34.230
what do they all have in common,
other than being really dead?

13:34.313 --> 13:35.648
They're all burned.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.859
-[Aram] <i>You said Aknoz was too.</i>
-[Ressler] <i>That's what he told us.</i>

13:38.943 --> 13:40.861
<i>-He was disfigured.</i>
-[Cooper] <i>Chemical burns?</i>

13:40.945 --> 13:44.615
No. I think there may
have been an incendiary in the IED.

13:44.698 --> 13:46.867
That Humvee burned like a bonfire.

13:46.951 --> 13:50.829
<i>Bremmer escaped after the explosion.</i>
<i>If everyone else was burned,</i>

13:50.913 --> 13:52.623
<i>it stands to reason that she was too.</i>

13:52.706 --> 13:55.334
If so, she couldn't have gotten far
without medical help.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.753
Major burns like that will lead
to hypovolemic shock

13:57.836 --> 14:01.549
<i>without medical intervention.</i>
<i>It's a life-threatening condition.</i>

14:01.632 --> 14:04.843
[Cooper] <i>Any physician giving her aid</i>
<i>would've turned her over.</i>

14:04.927 --> 14:08.138
[Park] <i>So she found help outside</i>
<i>the medical community.</i>

14:08.222 --> 14:11.559
Dirtbag doctors without borders?
Sounds like a job for Reddington.

14:11.642 --> 14:15.271
[Cooper] <i>Reach out. See if he has</i>
<i>a medical contact who knows the area.</i>

14:16.313 --> 14:19.400
The flash drive you gave me,
I got it back from my friend at the NSA.

14:19.483 --> 14:21.318
-Did he figure out the passcode?
-Please.

14:21.402 --> 14:25.990
He's not that much smarter than me.
Sure, he knows pi out two more places,

14:26.073 --> 14:28.492
but should one quinquadragintillion
really determine

14:28.576 --> 14:30.995
who has to buy the wings on bridge night?

14:31.078 --> 14:33.414
-I don't think so.
-He couldn't open it?

14:33.497 --> 14:35.416
Not technically.
He couldn't read the data.

14:35.499 --> 14:38.627
But he was able
to use a USB traffic sniffer

14:38.711 --> 14:42.381
to see the operation commands, which bear
the signature of a known hacker.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.174
She goes by Rakitin.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.886
When I say "she,"
I don't mean she's a woman.

14:46.969 --> 14:50.598
She could be, or a man.
I'm trying to alternate pronouns

14:50.681 --> 14:54.351
instead of defaulting to the generic "he"
to represent a man or a woman.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.770
Rakitin could be a he or a she.

14:57.771 --> 15:00.065
-Or a "they."
-This is good.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.358
We know who the hacker is,

15:01.442 --> 15:04.403
but we need to find out
what he or she hacked.

15:04.486 --> 15:07.698
And we won't know that
until you crack the passcode.

15:07.781 --> 15:10.743
-I'm on it.
-Tell your NSA friend he did good work.

15:10.826 --> 15:13.871
And buy hot wings for the month?
I don't think so.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.791
And they know to call us right away?

15:17.875 --> 15:19.251
Yes. They do.

15:19.335 --> 15:22.880
The minute the Freelancer sets foot
on U.S. soil, we'll know.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.256
Good morning.

15:25.007 --> 15:28.802
Would you please tell Dr. Grundig
that Lloyd Wilke is here?

15:28.886 --> 15:33.015
-Do you have an appointment?
-Mine is a lifetime appointment.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.311
[both laughing]

15:37.394 --> 15:38.479
-[door closes]
-Ah!

15:39.063 --> 15:40.731
What a pleasant surprise.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.026
Quite the environment you've created here.

15:44.109 --> 15:47.613
I can't tell if I'm in a waiting room
or a gentlemen's club.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.907
My mouth is positively watering

15:49.990 --> 15:55.704
for a smokey single-malt
and a smooth-draw Tatuaje Fausto.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.665
A good first impression is imperative

15:57.748 --> 16:00.668
to setting the tone
for a satisfied experience.

16:00.751 --> 16:03.253
[chuckles] My goodness.
How far you've come.

16:03.337 --> 16:06.507
They used to call Mickey here
the Back Room Butcher.

16:06.590 --> 16:11.053
If there was a cash payment involved,
he'd operate, no questions asked.

16:11.136 --> 16:14.223
The break room could use
a pot of coffee. You mind?

16:15.432 --> 16:20.729
There wasn't a procedure in the book
you wouldn't perform, or at least try to.

16:20.813 --> 16:24.650
That was after they
stripped your license. Cocaine, was it?

16:24.733 --> 16:29.029
But you kicked that and saved up
to buy a brand-new identity from me.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.489
And look at you now!

16:30.572 --> 16:32.533
Please. If any of this got out--

16:32.616 --> 16:34.201
Well, it doesn't have to.

16:34.284 --> 16:37.454
Listen, I'm looking for a woman
named Mary Bremmer.

16:37.538 --> 16:42.126
Three years ago, she had a mishap
near the Syrian-Turkish border.

16:42.209 --> 16:43.585
Suffered terrible burns,

16:43.669 --> 16:48.090
requiring the kind of discreet
medical care you once provided.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.216
I don't know her.

16:49.299 --> 16:52.177
But I suspect you may know
the sawbones who treated her.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.138
You want me to sell out another doctor?

16:54.221 --> 16:58.976
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
the patient trades in chemical weapons.

16:59.059 --> 17:01.979
She's a scourge on the human race.

17:02.062 --> 17:07.443
Help me find her
and your past remains in the past.

17:11.447 --> 17:15.868
I require a demonstration before I commit
such significant resources.

17:15.951 --> 17:19.538
-I hope you don't mind.
-Not at all. I expected as much.

17:19.621 --> 17:25.419
If one of your men would
retrieve the briefcase in my trunk.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.504
[dramatic music playing]

17:34.678 --> 17:37.431
Bujare. What is wrong?

17:39.266 --> 17:41.685
-You asked for a demonstration.
-[grunting]

17:44.188 --> 17:45.355
I'm giving you one.

17:54.281 --> 17:55.699
[dramatic music playing]

17:55.783 --> 17:59.453
Thanks to Mr. Reddington, we got the ID of
the physician who treated Mary Bremmer.

17:59.536 --> 18:02.414
But in Turkey. It'll take months
to obtain a search and seizure.

18:02.498 --> 18:06.043
Given his records may hold the key
to tracking a purveyor of banned weapons,

18:06.126 --> 18:09.379
Main Justice authorized a shortcut
by working with Turkish intelligence.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.048
Hacking his medical records.

18:11.131 --> 18:13.842
[Park] You were right.
She was burned in the Humvee.

18:13.926 --> 18:17.721
[Aram] Badly enough to require skin grafts
as well as prosthetics.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.140
These photos were taken
within days of the incident,

18:20.224 --> 18:22.601
but these were taken a year later.

18:23.393 --> 18:26.855
-No wonder we couldn't find her.
-[Cooper] We ran her through Interpol.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.357
What did it kick back?

18:28.440 --> 18:31.110
[Mary] A single touch
or an inhaled droplet

18:31.193 --> 18:36.198
disrupts the nerve signals
to his muscles, his heart and lungs.

18:36.281 --> 18:40.369
In a matter of seconds,
breathing will not be an option.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.204
Six nationalities. Six aliases.

18:42.287 --> 18:45.165
[Aram] All active, but according
to passport control archives,

18:45.249 --> 18:47.584
the last one she used was yesterday.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.504
-In Paris.
-Madeleine Toussaint.

18:50.587 --> 18:53.048
Remarkable. The delivery system?

18:53.924 --> 18:56.301
One drop on the key fob was all it took.

18:56.385 --> 19:01.056
Odorless, invisible,
lasts for days on any hard surface.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.977
Or load it into a crop duster
and take out a town. It's up to you.

19:05.644 --> 19:08.021
Killing's never been easier.

19:08.105 --> 19:11.400
For the last nine months, Bremmer's
been living as Madeleine Toussaint

19:11.483 --> 19:13.110
in the Batignolles district of Paris.

19:13.193 --> 19:16.655
She has a cover job
as an engineer at a chemical plant.

19:16.738 --> 19:22.202
Contact Interpol. Issue a Red Notice
for Bremmer's arrest and extradition.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.788
-Let's get a team to Paris.
-I'll go.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.916
-I need your help with that passcode.
-I could look for it in Paris.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.211
Sidewalk cafÃ©, pot of coffee,
couple of croissants.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.630
[Cooper] I'm on my way to Capitol Hill
to ask about Rakitin.

19:33.714 --> 19:38.093
I doubt I'll get traction
until you find out what's on that drive.

19:38.886 --> 19:43.098
-That's a no on coffee and croissants.
-We'll say hi to <i>Mona Lisa </i>for you.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.063
[Cooper] Thank you for taking the time.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.566
Always happy to make time for the FBI.

19:52.649 --> 19:55.360
Though, I am surprised. There was
no heads-up on what to talk about.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.363
Please sit. Take a load off and tell me,

19:58.447 --> 20:01.992
what is so hush-hush I get an
assistant director to make a house call?

20:02.075 --> 20:04.578
A hacker who goes by the name Rakitin.

20:04.661 --> 20:06.038
Never heard of him.

20:06.121 --> 20:07.706
-Excuse me?
-Anything else?

20:07.789 --> 20:10.292
I got an Elks Club
waiting to take a photo.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.920
Congressman,
you chair the House Intel Committee.

20:13.003 --> 20:15.923
I've read your report
on Russian cyber intrusion.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.549
I know you know Rakitin.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.886
What I know is your title.

20:20.969 --> 20:24.181
What I don't know is what you do.
No one would tell me.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.100
Yeah, I chair the intel committee.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.436
But for some reason,
I can't get any intel on you.

20:29.519 --> 20:32.856
-I run a classified task force.
-That's interested in Rakitin?

20:32.940 --> 20:36.109
-Why would that surprise you?
-It doesn't. It troubles me.

20:36.193 --> 20:38.320
Rakitin has friends in high places.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.489
I want to make sure
I'm not talking to one.

20:41.448 --> 20:43.575
I'm sorry, I'm completely confused.

20:44.534 --> 20:48.622
Three weeks ago, the hard drive
on my committee's computer was hacked.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.458
All the intel we had on Rakitin
was destroyed.

20:51.541 --> 20:52.709
I had no idea.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.671
My top staffer on the committee
disappeared the day it happened.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.507
Vanished into thin air.
And she was a patriot.

20:58.590 --> 21:01.385
A good person. But someone got to her.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.263
If they got to her, maybe they got to you.

21:04.346 --> 21:07.391
Maybe you're here to see
what I know about Rakitin.

21:07.933 --> 21:11.436
And if I know too much, maybe you're
gonna want to erase my hard drive.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.398
Here's a name and number.
Call it. Ask about me.

21:15.482 --> 21:19.194
If you're satisfied with
what you hear... we can talk more.

21:20.195 --> 21:21.196
If not...

21:21.780 --> 21:25.033
-thank you.
-I'm sure it seems like I'm paranoid.

21:25.117 --> 21:28.620
If we do talk, I'd like
to hear more about that hack.

21:28.704 --> 21:31.915
I have some paranoia of my own
about who might have been behind it.

21:32.666 --> 21:35.502
[Raymond] Rogelio, I hear you have news.

21:35.585 --> 21:38.297
A location and the room number.

21:38.380 --> 21:39.381
Ah...

21:40.966 --> 21:44.511
A youth hostel. How unexpectedly romantic!

21:44.594 --> 21:47.306
Is there anywhere
you don't have eyes and ears?

21:47.389 --> 21:51.101
I got either a maid, a waiter, a waitress,
a busboy, or bellhop

21:51.184 --> 21:52.853
in every corner of the city.

21:52.936 --> 21:56.398
Thank you, my friend.
And please give my regards to Carlos.

21:56.481 --> 22:00.319
Unfortunately, he's been deported again.

22:00.402 --> 22:02.863
Your friend's tunnel
in Calexico has been shut down.

22:02.946 --> 22:07.576
Oh, the goings-on at the border.
One side builds, the other shuts down.

22:07.659 --> 22:12.122
They hide, they seek, they come, they go.
It's all so <i>Tom and Jerry</i>.

22:12.622 --> 22:16.335
Yes, the tunnel is closed,
but the submarine is operational.

22:16.418 --> 22:20.714
And for tracking down Alban Veseli,
it will always be at your disposal.

22:28.972 --> 22:31.892
[Raymond] I once had a brief dustup
with an Armenian fellow

22:31.975 --> 22:36.188
who took umbrage at my acquisition
of a pipeline outside Kajaran.

22:36.855 --> 22:40.192
I tried to avoid him
by hiding out in a hostel.

22:40.275 --> 22:42.194
-You tried. Did he find you?
-No.

22:42.694 --> 22:46.448
But after three days of
communal showers, and curdled yogurt,

22:46.531 --> 22:49.534
James Taylor wannabes,
I couldn't stand it anymore.

22:49.618 --> 22:52.079
So I stole a backpack and a Fodors Guide

22:52.162 --> 22:54.831
and hiked to Turkey
through the Armenian Highlands.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.958
The Highlands. Mount Ararat.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.544
Yes, and FYI, no ark.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.758
Ah. Some things never change.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.764
No cameras. No security.

23:10.847 --> 23:12.641
Smart place to lay low.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.278
Not here.

23:28.865 --> 23:29.699
Ah.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.662
Running in a towel never ends well.

23:34.204 --> 23:36.331
Put on some pants and let's talk.

23:42.546 --> 23:46.466
[Friedenberg] I did as you suggested.
Checked up on you with Cynthia Panabaker.

23:46.967 --> 23:50.137
A straight arrow, if there was one.
She likes you.

23:50.220 --> 23:52.305
-Does she, now?
-She said:

23:52.389 --> 23:54.766
"He won't pee on your leg
and tell you it's raining."

23:54.850 --> 23:57.561
[chuckles] Sounds like Cynthia.

23:57.644 --> 24:01.398
You said you were
looking for information about Rakitin.

24:01.481 --> 24:03.692
I'm curious
what your committee knows about him.

24:04.192 --> 24:06.903
Not a lot, to be honest.
We don't have an ID.

24:06.987 --> 24:10.532
Rakitin could be
an entire hacker group, for all we know.

24:10.615 --> 24:13.326
He's using
a series of servers in Volgograd

24:13.410 --> 24:16.788
and targeting some of
our most carefully guarded secrets.

24:16.872 --> 24:17.789
Such as?

24:18.290 --> 24:21.293
The identities of CIA assets in Yasenevo.

24:21.376 --> 24:22.711
Their funding sources.

24:22.794 --> 24:25.505
Hacks of our own
internal threat assessments.

24:25.589 --> 24:28.466
-What does he do with this intel?
-There are a lot of theories.

24:28.550 --> 24:32.804
NSA thinks he's a black-market profiteer.
CIA's convinced he's a turncoat.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.306
And what do you think?

24:35.724 --> 24:37.934
Have you ever heard of N-13?

24:38.476 --> 24:42.397
Sleeper agent. A Russian asset
who vanished during the Cold War

24:42.522 --> 24:45.859
and was never proven to exist.
A 30-year-old ghost story.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.236
What if it's not?

24:50.238 --> 24:52.741
What if that asset is here?

24:53.241 --> 24:55.785
Not only active and deeply imbedded,

24:55.869 --> 24:59.331
but maneuvering
within our intel community.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.750
I don't know whose trust he has gained.

25:01.833 --> 25:04.794
CIA, Defense Intelligence.
God forbid, the FBI.

25:04.878 --> 25:08.882
But I think he's been here a long time.

25:09.466 --> 25:13.053
Long enough, he's become one of us.
And he's using us.

25:13.553 --> 25:16.514
You think Rakitin's
feeding active intel to N-13.

25:16.598 --> 25:17.515
I do.

25:17.599 --> 25:19.434
I'm the only man on this hill

25:19.517 --> 25:22.771
who may believe
your ghost story about a Russian spy.

25:23.271 --> 25:24.397
Go on.

25:24.898 --> 25:26.816
We recently intercepted a thumb drive

25:26.900 --> 25:29.778
containing sensitive intel
we believe was obtained by Rakitin.

25:29.861 --> 25:33.240
I suspect he intended
to deliver that drive to N-13.

25:33.323 --> 25:37.911
Why do you say that?
Did anything on the drive identify N-13?

25:37.994 --> 25:39.663
Our source believes

25:39.746 --> 25:42.290
it was intended
for someone on our Most Wanted list.

25:42.374 --> 25:45.126
Well, your source,
he or she is way off base.

25:45.210 --> 25:49.214
I'm telling you, N-13 is
buried deep within the U.S. government.

25:49.756 --> 25:53.009
That said, I strongly
encourage you to follow up on it.

25:53.093 --> 25:55.095
Based on what I know of Rakitin,

25:55.178 --> 25:59.266
he and N-13 pose
an imminent threat to national security.

26:02.894 --> 26:06.481
I must admit I'm surprised
you took this contract, Alban.

26:06.564 --> 26:10.902
I'd never pretend to call us friends,
but we are professional associates.

26:11.486 --> 26:12.404
It's a job.

26:12.487 --> 26:15.407
Unbridled resentment,
is that what this is about?

26:15.490 --> 26:18.159
You somehow blame me
for you going to prison?

26:18.243 --> 26:20.412
-You are why I went to prison.
-No.

26:20.912 --> 26:24.666
You went to prison because you were
caught doing a job I hired you to do.

26:25.375 --> 26:28.003
Don't blame me
for your failed cut-and-run.

26:28.086 --> 26:30.797
I've been in that box for seven years.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.591
And now you're out
because of Elizabeth Keen.

26:34.092 --> 26:36.261
That is why
you're aligned with her, isn't it?

26:36.344 --> 26:40.557
You bear me resentment for your failure
and now you both want me dead.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.225
[Alban] What's he worked up about?

26:42.309 --> 26:46.104
Talk to me about Agent Keen.
Tell me where I can find her.

26:46.730 --> 26:47.856
No idea.

26:47.939 --> 26:48.857
[Dembe] Raymond.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.612
[dramatic music playing]

26:56.072 --> 26:57.824
You just flew in from Paris.

26:57.907 --> 27:01.494
What were you doing there?
Taking a tour of the Temple de L'amour?

27:01.578 --> 27:04.080
Strolling along the Canal Saint-Martin?

27:04.164 --> 27:07.542
What do you think?
I was setting up the job.

27:07.625 --> 27:10.712
-I have no plans to be in France.
-So?

27:10.795 --> 27:13.506
How were you
going to carry out your contract?

27:13.590 --> 27:16.676
What's wrong with him?
How were you going to kill me?

27:16.760 --> 27:19.763
[chuckles] The contract's not on you.

27:21.097 --> 27:22.807
Who were you hired to kill?

27:26.519 --> 27:29.439
[Ressler] Madeleine Toussaint.
That's the name she's using.

27:29.522 --> 27:32.025
This is the address she gave her employer.

27:32.108 --> 27:34.402
If she's here,
we'll have to make an arrest.

27:34.486 --> 27:37.697
-You can file for extradition afterward.
-We're just here for backup.

27:44.871 --> 27:45.872
[knocking on door]

27:47.707 --> 27:49.250
[in French] Where's Madeleine Toussaint?

27:50.085 --> 27:51.294
What's going on?

27:51.378 --> 27:53.421
We have an international
warrant for her arrest.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.298
Madeleine's out of the country.

27:55.382 --> 27:56.341
[officer] Who are you?

27:56.424 --> 27:59.761
I'm her personal assistant.
I can call her if you'd like.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.138
Stand back. We're coming inside.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.768
How long have you worked for her?

28:06.851 --> 28:08.478
A couple years?

28:09.229 --> 28:10.522
-Where is she?
-[speaks in French]

28:10.605 --> 28:14.234
She's visiting an aunt in Albania,
but she's flying back tonight.

28:14.317 --> 28:17.237
[in English] She's visiting an aunt
in Albania. She'll be back later today.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.489
[in French] I have Madeleine's number.

28:19.572 --> 28:23.535
I'll call her right now,
and you can talk to her yourself.

28:24.035 --> 28:26.037
-[Cooper] Gun!
-[grunting]

28:29.833 --> 28:31.167
Hang on. We'll get help.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.173
She's dead.

28:38.425 --> 28:40.927
You know how much
I love "I told you so," Harold,

28:41.010 --> 28:43.388
so I confirmed the fact from the source.

28:43.471 --> 28:47.267
Elizabeth sprung the Freelancer
so she could engage his services.

28:47.350 --> 28:51.104
I refuse to believe that. Alban Veseli
cloaks assassination in mass murder.

28:51.187 --> 28:54.983
I don't care, Keen would
never use the Freelancer to kill you.

28:55.066 --> 28:56.067
<i>You're half right.</i>

28:56.151 --> 29:00.280
She didn't hire him to kill me.
She hired him to kill Chemical Mary.

29:00.363 --> 29:02.657
-Mary Bremmer. Why?
<i>-I'm not sure.</i>

29:02.741 --> 29:06.286
I'm hoping a slightly
more creative line of questioning

29:06.369 --> 29:08.872
might persuade him to reveal his plan,

29:08.955 --> 29:12.459
but one thing is clear,
it's already in motion.

29:12.542 --> 29:15.170
[Cooper] <i>Ressler's at</i>
<i>Bremmer's residence in Paris.</i>

29:15.253 --> 29:17.589
<i>She's flying back from Albania today.</i>

29:17.672 --> 29:20.717
[Raymond] <i>A transcontinental flight</i>
<i>filled with innocent passengers?</i>

29:20.800 --> 29:22.719
[Cooper] <i>We're contacting airlines.</i>

29:23.052 --> 29:25.889
[in French] Excuse me. Is that yours?

29:29.893 --> 29:32.479
-Are you flying to Paris?
-Yes, madam.

29:32.562 --> 29:33.855
Me too.

29:34.564 --> 29:35.565
<i>Merci.</i>

29:35.648 --> 29:39.235
[Raymond] <i>Move swiftly, Harold.</i>
<i>If Mary Bremmer boards that plane,</i>

29:39.319 --> 29:43.990
I'll bet you nickels to navy beans
the only way it comes down is in pieces.

29:48.286 --> 29:50.497
[Cooper] <i>We got a hit</i>
<i>on Bremmer's passports.</i>

29:50.580 --> 29:52.999
<i>She's en route to France on Parisian Air.</i>

29:53.082 --> 29:56.377
We're ten minutes from Charles de Gaulle.
How long before she lands?

29:56.461 --> 29:59.255
Half an hour, but we have to
assume that plane won't land.

29:59.339 --> 30:01.633
There are 162 passengers onboard,

30:01.716 --> 30:03.676
including families,
and he'll kill everyone.

30:03.760 --> 30:04.761
I thought the Freelancer

30:04.844 --> 30:07.347
-was going after Reddington.
-[Cooper] <i>That's what we all thought.</i>

30:07.430 --> 30:10.016
The airline confirms Bremmer's
on the boarded-passenger manifest.

30:10.099 --> 30:12.227
So Keen's taking out
a chemical arms trader,

30:12.310 --> 30:15.980
but she's gonna waste a plane
full of passengers in the process?

30:16.064 --> 30:20.568
Have the airport authorities prepare
rescue units, medics, the routine.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.153
I've got the tower.

30:22.237 --> 30:25.073
I've got air traffic control.
Call me when you're on site.

30:25.156 --> 30:26.324
Copy that.

30:26.950 --> 30:30.036
This is Harold Cooper,
assistant director of the FBI,

30:30.119 --> 30:31.871
<i>calling from Washington, D.C.</i>

30:31.955 --> 30:34.541
Stephan Gervais.
This is the supervisor. What's going on?

30:34.624 --> 30:35.792
We have a threat

30:35.875 --> 30:38.670
that someone's trying to bring down
Parisian Air flight 2419.

30:38.753 --> 30:40.046
Really? How?

30:40.129 --> 30:43.174
<i>We don't know that yet, Stephan.</i>
<i>We need your help.</i>

30:43.258 --> 30:45.051
[Gervais on radio] <i>Parisian Air 2419.</i>

30:45.134 --> 30:49.305
<i>Are you currently experiencing</i>
<i>any problems or equipment malfunctions?</i>

30:49.389 --> 30:52.559
Negative, Tower.
Everything is showing normal.

30:52.642 --> 30:55.353
[Gervais] <i>Anything unusual</i>
<i>in your preflight checklist?</i>

30:55.436 --> 30:57.146
[pilot] <i>Nothing. May I ask why?</i>

30:57.730 --> 31:00.692
Switch to discreet frequency 133.6.

31:01.568 --> 31:04.153
What do you want me to tell them?
Should they be looking for a bomb?

31:04.237 --> 31:07.407
The suspect engages in terrorist
activities disguised as accidents.

31:07.490 --> 31:09.242
It's doubtful he'd use explosives.

31:09.325 --> 31:10.827
He was on that plane.

31:10.910 --> 31:14.581
Security has footage of him entering
the cabin along with the cleaning crew.

31:14.664 --> 31:17.667
Tower, is there anything
we should be worried about?

31:17.750 --> 31:19.168
We've begun our descent.

31:19.252 --> 31:20.670
[Gervais] <i>Stand by. One moment.</i>

31:20.753 --> 31:22.255
<i>They just started their descent.</i>

31:22.338 --> 31:24.674
-The instrument panel.
-What about it?

31:26.092 --> 31:28.761
Seven years ago, Veseli derailed a train

31:28.845 --> 31:31.806
by making it hit a curve too fast.

31:37.478 --> 31:38.313
Clear out!

31:42.025 --> 31:45.737
He did that by rigging the two
speed-data sources in the cabin

31:45.820 --> 31:48.990
to show the train traveling
at a slower speed than its actual rate.

31:49.073 --> 31:51.868
Can your pilots check their controls
for signs of tampering?

31:51.951 --> 31:53.620
Parisian Air 2419,

31:53.703 --> 31:56.623
it's possible your controls
have been compromised.

31:56.706 --> 31:58.708
Can you take a careful look?

31:58.791 --> 32:00.710
Roger. Stand by, Tower.

32:00.793 --> 32:02.754
[suspenseful music playing]

32:15.975 --> 32:17.352
[copilot] There is a thumb drive.

32:17.435 --> 32:21.147
We got something. Someone left
a thumb drive in the Data Loader.

32:21.731 --> 32:24.734
There's a panel in the cockpit
for software and database updates.

32:24.817 --> 32:26.444
Someone left a thumb drive.

32:26.527 --> 32:29.948
Which could be corrupting their
instruments or running its own scripts.

32:31.324 --> 32:33.743
-Oh, no.
-The plane's making its approach.

32:33.826 --> 32:36.162
<i>Are your tracking systems</i>
<i>showing anything unusual?</i>

32:36.245 --> 32:39.874
Our GPS system is based on information
transmitted to us from the aircraft.

32:39.958 --> 32:43.544
<i>If that plane isn't where it should be,</i>
<i>we would not know it.</i>

32:43.628 --> 32:47.715
That data stick wasn't left by accident.
It is a brute force attack.

32:47.799 --> 32:48.716
Take it out!

32:48.800 --> 32:52.011
Parisian Air 2419, remove the drive.

32:52.095 --> 32:55.014
<i>-I repeat, remove the drive.</i>
-Copy, Tower.

32:58.017 --> 33:00.645
-[instruments beeping]
-[automated voice] <i>Warning! Warning!</i>

33:00.728 --> 33:02.730
[all yelling]

33:04.565 --> 33:06.943
<i>-Warning! Warning!</i>
-Autopilot off.

33:07.443 --> 33:09.278
-Flight directors off.
<i>-Warning!</i>

33:09.362 --> 33:11.364
[dramatic music playing]

33:19.163 --> 33:20.331
[beeping]

33:20.415 --> 33:21.749
What's going on?

33:22.709 --> 33:26.254
They're too low. Immediate right turn!
Heading 230!

33:26.337 --> 33:29.841
<i>-Traffic is directly in front of you!</i>
-[pilot] I have control.

33:45.440 --> 33:49.277
[pilot] <i>Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry</i>
<i>for that sudden shift in altitude.</i>

33:49.360 --> 33:52.822
<i>We obviously had an incident,</i>
<i>but we're safe and on course,</i>

33:52.905 --> 33:54.615
<i>and we'll be landing shortly.</i>

33:54.699 --> 33:56.701
[all cheering]

34:03.624 --> 34:06.210
What's happening? Are they dying?

34:06.794 --> 34:10.006
No, sir. I believe
those are cries of celebration.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.843
Tower, Parisian Air 2-4-1-niner.

34:13.926 --> 34:16.846
We are clear of the traffic
and climbing to 8000.

34:17.430 --> 34:19.766
<i>We will begin our approach for landing.</i>

34:38.201 --> 34:39.118
Excuse me.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.870
A passenger, Mary Bremmer?

34:40.953 --> 34:42.789
That's it. That's everyone.

34:42.872 --> 34:43.956
[Park] Are you sure?

34:44.040 --> 34:46.834
Feel free to look,
but I checked the cabins.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.711
There's no one on the plane.

34:56.052 --> 34:57.970
[Cooper] Mary Bremmer
was never on that plane.

34:58.054 --> 35:01.516
She made it to the airport,
but she was abducted outside.

35:03.893 --> 35:06.062
[Raymond] What about
the passenger manifest?

35:06.145 --> 35:08.189
You said it showed her onboard.

35:08.773 --> 35:10.274
After Bremmer was taken,

35:10.358 --> 35:13.945
a woman entered the terminal
with her passport and ticket,

35:14.028 --> 35:17.532
which was slipped into the purse
of a passenger at the gate.

35:17.615 --> 35:20.159
The unidentified woman left the terminal

35:20.243 --> 35:23.037
and the passenger boarded
the flight as Bremmer.

35:24.497 --> 35:27.542
This unidentified woman,
she look familiar to you?

35:28.209 --> 35:33.172
These are the best images we could pull,
but yes, we believe it's Keen.

35:33.256 --> 35:38.010
So Elizabeth conducted
an operatic performance.

35:38.094 --> 35:40.221
Getting an assassin out of prison,

35:40.304 --> 35:44.058
elaborately sabotaging
a commercial airliner,

35:44.142 --> 35:48.604
only to snatch her target
from the jaws of death at the last second.

35:49.564 --> 35:53.776
Perhaps she wanted the world to believe
Bremmer died in the crash.

35:55.194 --> 35:56.571
To what end?

35:57.196 --> 35:58.656
I can't fathom.

35:59.323 --> 36:03.744
It's more likely Elizabeth wanted Bremmer
to think she saved her life.

36:03.828 --> 36:06.372
Which would put Bremmer
in Elizabeth's debt.

36:06.455 --> 36:09.709
Whatever they're working on,
we're gonna make it difficult.

36:09.792 --> 36:12.587
Our people are combing through
Bremmer's flat

36:12.670 --> 36:14.589
and ID'd a number of associates.

36:14.672 --> 36:16.507
<i>Teams are en route as we speak.</i>

36:16.591 --> 36:18.050
[man] Freeze! Freeze!

36:18.134 --> 36:20.511
I still can't get over the fact
Elizabeth was willing

36:20.595 --> 36:23.181
to let the Freelancer crash two planes.

36:25.224 --> 36:28.311
I was holding out hope for her,
we all were. But now?

36:29.145 --> 36:31.647
It seems she's past
the point of no return.

36:32.523 --> 36:33.858
[man] FBI!

36:38.196 --> 36:41.574
I'll try to leave the moralizing
to you, Harold.

36:43.868 --> 36:47.705
In the meantime,
perhaps this will ease your pain.

36:48.706 --> 36:51.626
Tell Donald to pay
a visit to this address.

36:52.251 --> 36:53.628
[Cooper] What is this?

36:53.711 --> 36:55.254
Your team worked very hard

36:55.338 --> 36:58.674
to put the Freelancer behind bars
the first time around.

37:00.009 --> 37:02.428
I think that's probably
the right place for him.

37:07.516 --> 37:09.602
<i>âª It's a long way down âª</i>

37:09.685 --> 37:11.103
Thank you for the Scotch.

37:12.396 --> 37:15.566
<i>âª It's a long way down âª</i>

37:21.489 --> 37:24.742
<i>âª It's a long way down âª</i>

37:26.160 --> 37:28.412
<i>âª It's a long way down âª</i>

37:28.496 --> 37:29.956
[man] Whoa, whoa. Easy, bro.

37:30.623 --> 37:33.125
The man in the hat
said the popo'd be here.

37:35.169 --> 37:38.714
<i>âª It's a long way down âª</i>

37:38.798 --> 37:40.675
Why does this feel like an empty victory?

37:40.758 --> 37:43.970
Because this guy has no idea
what Keen's up to with Chemical Mary.

37:45.763 --> 37:47.390
[Mary] Open this door right now!

37:47.473 --> 37:48.891
I want to see her.

37:48.975 --> 37:50.184
Where is she?

37:50.935 --> 37:52.186
The woman!

37:53.354 --> 37:54.689
I want to talk to her.

37:55.481 --> 37:57.817
Do you hear me? [grunts]

37:59.568 --> 38:01.404
Open this door right now!

38:01.904 --> 38:03.072
I want to see her!

38:08.619 --> 38:10.621
Angela is the one you were asking about.

38:10.705 --> 38:13.249
She told me that Veseli was at the hostel.

38:13.874 --> 38:16.002
Angela, I can't thank you enough.

38:16.752 --> 38:18.254
I just have one question.

38:18.337 --> 38:22.633
I need to know how you
came by this valuable information.

38:23.092 --> 38:24.510
[in Spanish] It's all right, Angela.

38:24.593 --> 38:25.928
You did nothing wrong.

38:26.804 --> 38:30.558
[in English] It was a woman.

38:31.142 --> 38:31.976
This woman?

38:32.643 --> 38:33.853
[Angela] Ah...

38:34.395 --> 38:39.525
I asked her how she knew
that I was looking for him.

38:39.608 --> 38:41.027
She wouldn't say.

38:41.527 --> 38:42.361
<i>Gracias.</i>

38:45.573 --> 38:47.116
Oh, your cousin, Carlos,

38:47.199 --> 38:50.995
I'm told he's somewhere
under the Gulf of Mexico as we speak.

38:51.579 --> 38:54.498
<i>Muchas gracias, </i>Raymond.
If there's anything I can do for you--

38:54.582 --> 38:57.585
You've done more than you know,
and all to the good.

39:00.713 --> 39:02.423
Well, that's a load off.

39:03.382 --> 39:05.968
Elizabeth wanted you
to find the Freelancer.

39:06.052 --> 39:07.303
Yeah.

39:07.386 --> 39:08.888
Knowing that when we did,

39:08.971 --> 39:12.308
we'd work with the FBI to stop him
from crashing that plane.

39:12.391 --> 39:15.770
So she hires a lawyer
to obtain Veseli's freedom,

39:15.853 --> 39:17.813
pays Veseli to crash a plane,

39:17.897 --> 39:21.901
uses the threat of that crash
to gain Chemical Mary's trust,

39:21.984 --> 39:24.612
then gives us intel
to keep the plane from going down.

39:24.695 --> 39:26.697
Sounds like one of your plans.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.199
It does, doesn't it?

39:28.282 --> 39:30.951
She may not be interested
in crashing a plane,

39:31.035 --> 39:33.204
but she's still in business
with a war criminal.

39:33.287 --> 39:34.872
Tomorrow's problem.

39:34.955 --> 39:37.249
Tonight, we savor the small victory.

39:37.333 --> 39:40.002
And we should tell Edward to fuel the jet.

39:40.086 --> 39:43.381
We need to pay
our friend in Moscow a visit.

39:43.464 --> 39:45.716
[phone keypad beeping]

39:47.843 --> 39:48.844
[Aram] Hi. Sir.

39:48.928 --> 39:53.349
Sorry to-- It's late.
And, uh... you're drinking alone.

39:53.432 --> 39:55.476
Which is fine, I mean, I can--

39:55.559 --> 39:57.895
-What is it?
-Good news on the passcode.

39:58.687 --> 40:00.231
-You cracked it.
-What? Oh.

40:00.314 --> 40:03.651
Uh, no. That would be great news,
like miraculously great.

40:03.734 --> 40:06.695
No. The good news is
I figured out how to crack it.

40:07.321 --> 40:08.197
With this.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.991
I don't think Rakitin
chose a steel flash drive

40:11.075 --> 40:12.243
to protect his software.

40:12.326 --> 40:15.663
If I'm right, there's a capacitive scanner
hidden in the flash drive.

40:15.746 --> 40:18.958
It is the best security platform
in password-less identification.

40:19.041 --> 40:20.251
There's no password.

40:20.334 --> 40:23.045
It's biometric.
That's where this comes in.

40:23.796 --> 40:24.713
Get the print.

40:24.797 --> 40:26.632
Put it in. And... [whistles]

40:26.715 --> 40:27.716
open sesame.

40:27.800 --> 40:31.595
Or, you know, some less
politically incorrect exclamation.

40:31.679 --> 40:34.056
-So all I need is a fingerprint.
-Yeah.

40:34.140 --> 40:36.475
And that is where the miracle comes in.

40:36.559 --> 40:38.477
Figuring out whose print to use.

40:40.146 --> 40:41.272
Thank you, Aram.

40:42.606 --> 40:43.941
Here's hoping for a miracle.

40:44.024 --> 40:46.026
[dramatic music playing]

41:04.295 --> 41:05.546
Raymond.

41:05.629 --> 41:06.797
[in Russian] Sit down.

41:06.881 --> 41:07.923
Warm up.

41:09.508 --> 41:10.718
[Raymond in Russian] Thank you.

41:13.888 --> 41:15.014
To health.

41:20.936 --> 41:22.563
[Sikorsky in English]
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

41:22.646 --> 41:25.232
<i>We have much to discuss.</i>

41:25.316 --> 41:27.735
I am told Rakitin is in play.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.696
My safety deposit box was compromised.

41:31.822 --> 41:35.618
-The flash drive I entrusted you with?
-I'm still looking for it.

41:35.701 --> 41:39.497
No doubt we have Elizabeth Keen
to thank for it going missing.

41:40.080 --> 41:43.000
My position in regard to her
has not changed.

41:43.083 --> 41:45.794
[Sikorsky] <i>I understand.</i>
<i>She is untouchable.</i>

41:46.378 --> 41:48.547
<i>But you must understand,</i>

41:48.631 --> 41:51.258
Harold Cooper is not.

41:51.342 --> 41:53.761
[suspenseful music playing]

42:01.644 --> 42:03.395
Well, miracles never cease.

42:03.896 --> 42:06.941
If he gains access to the Rakitin files,

42:07.441 --> 42:09.360
you'll have to eliminate him.

42:12.655 --> 42:13.822
I understand.

42:19.787 --> 42:21.789
[dramatic music playing]
