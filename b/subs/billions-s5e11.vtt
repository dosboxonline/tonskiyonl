07:12.099 --> 07:13.433
internships and gigs.

07:13.474 --> 07:14.851
And then they'll

07:13.474 --> 07:14.851
all have jobs locked in

07:14.893 --> 07:16.103
if they aren't

07:14.893 --> 07:16.103
doing grad school.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.146
Everyone from B school

07:16.144 --> 07:18.146
has stuff locked in too.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.439
I don't regret much.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.400
But I regret not getting

07:19.480 --> 07:21.400
to just live a little

07:21.441 --> 07:23.235
when I was young.

07:23.277 --> 07:24.652
I couldn't afford to. I--

07:24.694 --> 07:26.529
I had to start. You don't.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.282
We're gonna fall behind.

07:28.323 --> 07:30.367
-Who're you gonna fall behind?

07:28.323 --> 07:30.367
-Our whole cohort,

07:30.409 --> 07:32.953
like moving in step with them,

07:30.409 --> 07:32.953
ahead of them.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.829
It's not a race like that.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.497
He still doesn't understand

07:34.871 --> 07:36.497
what we've been robbed of.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.125
-[scoffs]

07:36.539 --> 07:38.125
-Robbed?

07:38.166 --> 07:40.627
Yeah, of failing,

07:38.166 --> 07:40.627
of advancing on our own

07:40.668 --> 07:42.462
because we have to.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.214
You got to do

07:42.503 --> 07:44.214
a thing by yourself.

07:44.256 --> 07:45.757
We'll always be...

07:45.799 --> 07:47.259
Mike Prince's daughters.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.969
Yes. Someone will

07:47.301 --> 07:48.969
always say that garbage.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.262
You gotta tune it out.

07:50.304 --> 07:52.139
Hard to do when it's

07:50.304 --> 07:52.139
your own voice saying it.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.015
-[sighs]

07:52.180 --> 07:54.015
-It's not even about

07:54.057 --> 07:55.809
if having money

07:54.057 --> 07:55.809
makes things easier.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.894
It's just putting something

07:55.850 --> 07:57.894
on the line for real.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.771
And you were robbed of that?

07:59.813 --> 08:02.107
Yeah, we were. There's such

07:59.813 --> 08:02.107
a safe landing for us,

08:02.149 --> 08:03.775
no matter what.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.360
We might as well try.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.028
But also whatever jobs we get,

08:07.070 --> 08:08.947
people will think it's

08:07.070 --> 08:08.947
because of you anyway.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.991
That's true. At first.

08:13.452 --> 08:15.287
But hey,

08:15.329 --> 08:17.872
if you want

08:15.329 --> 08:17.872
a chance to fail...

08:17.914 --> 08:19.666
-We don't plan to fail.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.666
-Fine.

08:19.707 --> 08:22.169
[scoffs] If you want

08:19.707 --> 08:22.169
a chance to succeed,

08:22.210 --> 08:24.545
help me with Hypercube.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.756
-Your digital banking startup?

08:24.587 --> 08:26.756
-That's right.

08:26.798 --> 08:29.592
We need to onboard

08:26.798 --> 08:29.592
a major depositor client.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.308
Wait. Really? Weed?

08:36.350 --> 08:38.310
Lawful weed.

08:38.352 --> 08:41.396
Business and financial services

08:38.352 --> 08:41.396
for the legal cannabis industry.

08:41.438 --> 08:44.399
The woman who runs this company,

08:41.438 --> 08:44.399
getting her to jump on board

08:44.441 --> 08:47.944
will take insight, enthusiasm,

08:47.986 --> 08:50.197
an understanding of

08:47.986 --> 08:50.197
the space, intelligence.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.948
In a word, youth.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.783
Yours.

08:53.825 --> 08:56.244
You want to take a meeting?

08:53.825 --> 08:56.244
Win her over?

08:57.704 --> 08:59.456
Scooter will supervise at first,

08:59.498 --> 09:00.999
but you could be

08:59.498 --> 09:00.999
the client-facing piece

09:01.041 --> 09:02.167
in this space.

09:05.753 --> 09:07.839
-In.

09:05.753 --> 09:07.839
-Oh yeah, fully.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.383
And if it works out,

09:07.881 --> 09:09.383
can we stay involved?

09:09.424 --> 09:11.718
[chuckles]

09:09.424 --> 09:11.718
Try to close first.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.512
You don't have to worry

09:11.759 --> 09:13.512
about the rest now.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.263
Study up.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.849
[Liz] Okay, wow, this

09:15.305 --> 09:17.849
is very interesting.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.434
[Gail] Yeah, worth a shot.

09:20.352 --> 09:21.686
<i>Dad, this is legit.</i>

09:21.728 --> 09:24.439
[conversation continues faintly]

09:32.406 --> 09:34.741
That looks exquisite on you.

09:34.782 --> 09:37.494
Looks like Zales

09:34.782 --> 09:37.494
in a push-up bra.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.371
I want the 600-karat

09:37.536 --> 09:39.371
black opal,

09:39.413 --> 09:42.832
the uncut gem shit.

09:39.413 --> 09:42.832
What do you got?

09:42.874 --> 09:44.751
I may have something

09:42.874 --> 09:44.751
in my other case.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.045
Are we looking

09:44.792 --> 09:47.045
for an engagement?

09:47.087 --> 09:49.047
Does Superman take

09:47.087 --> 09:49.047
to the air because he needs

09:49.089 --> 09:51.758
to be in Chicago

09:49.089 --> 09:51.758
for a convention?

09:51.799 --> 09:54.386
He flies because he can.

09:55.178 --> 09:56.596
This is that.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.309
Are you sure you're ready?

10:01.351 --> 10:02.977
"I'm ready for anything"

10:01.351 --> 10:02.977
is basically

10:03.019 --> 10:04.645
my first, middle

10:03.019 --> 10:04.645
and last name.

10:04.687 --> 10:07.399
Even meeting my father?

10:04.687 --> 10:07.399
Most guys don't want to.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.443
Right. The dad dinner.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.278
Sure.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.154
I'll look him in the eye,

10:11.319 --> 10:13.154
give him a firm handshake,

10:13.196 --> 10:15.198
and assure him my intentions

10:13.196 --> 10:15.198
are honorable.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.200
He'll see right

10:15.240 --> 10:17.200
through that act.

10:17.242 --> 10:19.035
He's a lawyer,

10:17.242 --> 10:19.035
so he's spent his life

10:19.077 --> 10:20.579
slicing through

10:19.077 --> 10:20.579
bullshit artists.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.122
Hmm.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.331
He can look

10:22.163 --> 10:23.331
at people and know

10:23.373 --> 10:24.665
what's really inside of them.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.834
He's self-made. Tough.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.003
Chuck Norris tough

10:26.876 --> 10:29.003
or Guido the killer pimp?

10:29.045 --> 10:31.881
See, he'll get that reference,

10:29.045 --> 10:31.881
probably, and know if it's good.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.342
So I earn his respect

10:31.923 --> 10:34.342
by going toe to toe.

10:34.384 --> 10:35.343
Like a fighter.

10:35.385 --> 10:36.511
No, kiss his ass.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.012
-But do it well.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.012
-Ah.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.014
Trombone blown,

10:38.054 --> 10:40.014
Tom Byron-style.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.308
You got it.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.976
Another reference I don't--

10:43.017 --> 10:44.685
The important

10:43.017 --> 10:44.685
thing is he will.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.729
Pigeon blood ruby.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.567
That's a hell of a stone.

10:50.609 --> 10:52.152
Keep it on ice.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.779
I'll call you back for it.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.697
After I succeed

10:54.821 --> 10:56.697
with Big Daddy.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.283
[Chelz chuckles]

10:59.909 --> 11:01.411
There's the precedent.

11:01.453 --> 11:02.912
That's one way to go.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.539
It's your call.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.291
Yeah.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.920
Wow. This is why

11:07.875 --> 11:10.920
we got into it, no?

11:10.962 --> 11:12.880
To argue before

11:10.962 --> 11:12.880
those nine robes?

11:12.922 --> 11:16.176
Even I can't be blasé about

11:12.922 --> 11:16.176
my first Supreme Court brief.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.927
-Hmm.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.927
-Though it's tempered

11:17.969 --> 11:19.846
by the fact that we're not

11:17.969 --> 11:19.846
really trying a case

11:19.887 --> 11:21.722
that might change the world

11:19.887 --> 11:21.722
but merely baiting a hook.

11:21.764 --> 11:24.309
The thing about arguments

11:21.764 --> 11:24.309
before SCOTUS is

11:24.351 --> 11:27.020
they are never about what

11:24.351 --> 11:27.020
they're purported to be about.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.563
Hmm.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.231
Neither are the opinions

11:28.605 --> 11:30.231
or dissents,

11:30.273 --> 11:32.859
but everyone

11:30.273 --> 11:32.859
just presses forward.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.529
As you are doing,

11:32.900 --> 11:35.529
Ms. Sacker, impressively.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.947
Oh, I'm gonna sell it

11:35.570 --> 11:37.947
because I believe it.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.658
And it will be in the record.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.909
Solicitor General DeGiulio

11:39.698 --> 11:41.909
shall be duly impressed.

11:41.951 --> 11:45.205
And soon enough it really

11:41.951 --> 11:45.205
will be you at the lectern.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.042
[elevator bell rings]

12:04.057 --> 12:05.517
Are those them?

12:10.355 --> 12:11.814
[exhales]

12:14.275 --> 12:18.029
These.. are the

12:14.275 --> 12:18.029
Glengarry leads.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.947
But do not try to steal them.

12:19.989 --> 12:23.201
They will be handed out

12:19.989 --> 12:23.201
to closers, which,

12:23.243 --> 12:24.994
unlike Dave Moss

12:23.243 --> 12:24.994
and Shelley Levene,

12:25.036 --> 12:27.163
you will be because Axe is.

12:27.205 --> 12:28.998
Those are the Auerbachs,

12:27.205 --> 12:28.998
aren't they?

12:29.040 --> 12:31.626
Axe used to talk about bringing

12:29.040 --> 12:31.626
them out for a huge win.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.127
They are indeed.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.046
-What's a--?

12:33.169 --> 12:35.046
-Red Auerbach, Tuk.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.633
Old-time Boston Celtics

12:35.088 --> 12:38.633
head coach and then GM and...

12:38.675 --> 12:41.010
You can't work here

12:38.675 --> 12:41.010
and not know this stuff.

12:41.052 --> 12:42.429
I've told you before.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.431
Ask me anything about wrestling.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.350
The NWA, AWA, WWWF.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.686
The Territories? I've got it.

12:49.728 --> 12:52.355
Even know who the

12:49.728 --> 12:52.355
Third Executioner was.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.232
I'm just not up on

12:52.397 --> 12:54.232
old-time basketball yet.

12:54.274 --> 12:57.110
Well, these cigars

12:54.274 --> 12:57.110
were very fucking significant.

12:57.151 --> 13:00.779
They were and are.

12:57.151 --> 13:00.779
Red Auerbach's Punch cigars.

13:00.821 --> 13:02.865
After bringing nine titles

13:00.821 --> 13:02.865
to the city of Boston,

13:02.907 --> 13:04.701
he could smoke wherever

13:02.907 --> 13:04.701
he damn pleased.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.994
But his favorite place was on

13:04.743 --> 13:06.994
the bench on the parquet

13:07.036 --> 13:10.415
of the old Boston Garden

13:07.036 --> 13:10.415
when victory was assured.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.459
Give me one of those,

13:10.457 --> 13:12.459
I'll light it up right here,

13:12.500 --> 13:14.461
deal with the smoke

13:12.500 --> 13:14.461
alarms and fines later.

13:14.502 --> 13:15.962
We'll smoke them when Red did:

13:16.003 --> 13:17.796
The moment victory is in hand,

13:16.003 --> 13:17.796
when our bank is solvent,

13:17.838 --> 13:19.090
not when the game

13:17.838 --> 13:19.090
is still in doubt.

13:27.766 --> 13:30.560
We really didn't have

13:27.766 --> 13:30.560
to do it like this.

13:30.602 --> 13:32.228
I would have wired it.

13:32.270 --> 13:35.356
Sometimes auspicious

13:32.270 --> 13:35.356
beginnings and auspicious

13:35.398 --> 13:37.066
endings need to be

13:35.398 --> 13:37.066
done in person.

13:37.108 --> 13:39.444
You wanted me to have

13:37.108 --> 13:39.444
to hand you 25 million.

13:42.656 --> 13:43.782
Like this.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.413
I guess I just wanted

13:48.369 --> 13:50.413
to see what it would be like

13:50.455 --> 13:52.957
to hold this much at once.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.293
Perhaps see if anything

13:52.999 --> 13:55.293
rushed through me.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.672
But, uh...

14:00.214 --> 14:01.675
No,

14:02.759 --> 14:04.469
just sadness.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.139
And a cold certainty that

14:08.181 --> 14:10.350
none of this

14:08.181 --> 14:10.350
ever had to happen.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.059
There we agree.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.020
So you still get a rush

14:12.101 --> 14:14.020
from the money alone?

14:14.061 --> 14:15.730
Don't ask me those ki--

14:16.690 --> 14:18.483
I'm gonna head out.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.486
And like that,

14:18.525 --> 14:21.486
lines are drawn.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.738
No, tattooed, permanently.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.116
Some of your money to me.

14:27.158 --> 14:28.868
The rest of you to<i> him.</i>

14:28.909 --> 14:30.995
Congratulations, then,

14:28.909 --> 14:30.995
are in order, to<i> you.</i>

14:31.037 --> 14:32.872
For orchestrating it all.

14:32.913 --> 14:34.708
Since the moment

14:32.913 --> 14:34.708
you set your sights

14:34.749 --> 14:36.459
on Axe five years ago,

14:36.501 --> 14:38.753
you have orchestrated

14:36.501 --> 14:38.753
a perfect plan

14:38.795 --> 14:41.756
to impel us together,

14:38.795 --> 14:41.756
which makes no sense.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.175
Unless someone knows you,

14:44.217 --> 14:45.885
which I have.

14:47.846 --> 14:49.138
Goodbye.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.435
[door opens, closes]

15:01.067 --> 15:02.360
[exhales]

15:03.986 --> 15:05.822
<i>I'm hearing rumblings...</i>

15:05.864 --> 15:07.824
<i>that Solicitor General DeGiulio</i>

15:07.866 --> 15:09.784
is awaiting a brief

15:07.866 --> 15:09.784
from the NY AG.

15:09.826 --> 15:12.036
Once he has it,

15:09.826 --> 15:12.036
he officially asks

15:12.078 --> 15:13.913
the Supreme Court

15:12.078 --> 15:13.913
to grant cert

15:13.954 --> 15:16.207
in a financial services

15:13.954 --> 15:16.207
case which

15:16.249 --> 15:19.711
<i>would clear the way</i>

15:16.249 --> 15:19.711
<i>for processing cannabis money.</i>

15:19.753 --> 15:21.962
I don't see SCOTUS saying no.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.758
Looks like your read

15:22.004 --> 15:24.758
on Chuck's plan was center mass.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.801
Track this brief.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.801
Use Hall.

15:26.843 --> 15:29.095
Make sure it says what

15:26.843 --> 15:29.095
we need it to say.

15:29.136 --> 15:31.055
I know you're anxious.

15:31.097 --> 15:34.225
But if you act and bank this

15:31.097 --> 15:34.225
money before cert is granted,

15:34.267 --> 15:36.227
and we can argue

15:34.267 --> 15:36.227
a coming change,

15:36.269 --> 15:38.229
you'll be whacked

15:36.269 --> 15:38.229
with civil charges.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.898
You could get

15:38.271 --> 15:39.898
your charter stripped.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.400
Which is why we have

15:39.980 --> 15:42.400
to act when it goes in,

15:42.442 --> 15:44.402
but right at that moment.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.070
Prince has made

15:44.444 --> 15:46.070
the same determination.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.030
We gotta vault over him.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.701
Axe, seems we have news.

15:51.743 --> 15:54.036
Tell me more about this

15:51.743 --> 15:54.036
company Prince is targeting.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.956
<i>Called FYC,</i>

15:54.078 --> 15:56.956
<i>Fine Young Cannabis.</i>

15:56.997 --> 15:58.708
<i>CEO is Dawn Winslow,</i>

15:58.750 --> 16:00.794
former music producer.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.712
She got outta that

16:00.835 --> 16:02.712
to pursue her true love.

16:02.754 --> 16:04.714
Now her company is

16:02.754 --> 16:04.714
a market leader,

16:04.756 --> 16:07.300
one point six bil in revenue

16:04.756 --> 16:07.300
last year alone.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.135
[Hard Bob]<i> Axe, I gotta say,</i>

16:09.176 --> 16:11.304
<i>being too early is as bad</i>

16:09.176 --> 16:11.304
<i>as being too late.</i>

16:11.345 --> 16:13.306
In this case worse.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.683
If you onboard

16:13.347 --> 16:15.683
this cash too quick,

16:15.725 --> 16:17.727
you'll get slapped

16:15.725 --> 16:17.727
with civil penalties.

16:17.769 --> 16:21.856
Thanks, Hard Bob. I already

16:17.769 --> 16:21.856
got that from my actual lawyer.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.400
And what do we got to land FYC?

16:24.442 --> 16:27.278
<i>No, she's not gonna sign</i>

16:24.442 --> 16:27.278
<i>on for free checking.</i>

16:27.320 --> 16:30.740
I hate to say it,

16:27.320 --> 16:30.740
but you need to outbid him.

16:30.782 --> 16:33.660
Banks are basically paying

16:30.782 --> 16:33.660
zero interest right now.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.119
We go the other way--

16:35.161 --> 16:36.913
I don't like overpaying.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.913
Ever.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.623
But as a new bank,

16:38.665 --> 16:40.625
setting up a new desperate

16:38.665 --> 16:40.625
precedent like this

16:40.667 --> 16:42.042
is suicide.

16:45.129 --> 16:48.090
I know how Prince

16:45.129 --> 16:48.090
plans to lock up FYC:

16:48.132 --> 16:50.050
-with his daughters.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.050
-Cagey move.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.595
Good for branding

16:50.092 --> 16:52.595
and the CEO Winslow

16:52.637 --> 16:54.931
gets to look like

16:52.637 --> 16:54.931
she's mentoring the next gen.

16:54.973 --> 16:57.767
-Total bullshit, but cagey.

16:54.973 --> 16:57.767
-[Wags] What's our counter?

16:57.809 --> 16:59.310
What do we know

16:57.809 --> 16:59.310
about Winslow's leaks?

16:59.352 --> 17:01.354
Not fucking much.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.354
She's refusing to speak

17:01.395 --> 17:03.147
with anyone from Axe Bank.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.607
-Including...?

17:03.189 --> 17:04.607
-Including Axe.

17:04.649 --> 17:07.026
Lady says she's entering

17:04.649 --> 17:07.026
into an exclusive

17:07.067 --> 17:09.779
negotiating period

17:07.067 --> 17:09.779
with Prince.

17:09.821 --> 17:11.948
<i>Lady says that means something.</i>

17:11.990 --> 17:13.741
It means you all do better.

17:21.499 --> 17:24.335
We can't stop Prince from

17:21.499 --> 17:24.335
having his meeting with her,

17:24.377 --> 17:27.254
or from agreeing to

17:24.377 --> 17:27.254
a deal in principle, even.

17:27.296 --> 17:30.424
We gotta wedge in there in the

17:27.296 --> 17:30.424
moments right before closing.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.844
But Chieftain, if she

17:30.466 --> 17:32.844
won't even meet with you...

17:32.886 --> 17:34.637
<i>She doesn't have</i>

17:32.886 --> 17:34.637
<i>a deal to shop yet.</i>

17:34.679 --> 17:37.390
<i>By the time she does,</i>

17:34.679 --> 17:37.390
<i>we need to top her.</i>

17:37.431 --> 17:40.393
<i>But believe me,</i>

17:37.431 --> 17:40.393
<i>before she locks it in,</i>

17:40.434 --> 17:42.353
she's gonna have one

17:40.434 --> 17:42.353
last look at what's out there.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.855
It's human nature.

17:43.897 --> 17:46.065
And I'll be what

17:43.897 --> 17:46.065
she's starin' at.

17:48.609 --> 17:51.278
You don't look like

17:48.609 --> 17:51.278
the man I know you to be.

17:53.865 --> 17:55.616
And what man

17:53.865 --> 17:55.616
do you think that is?

17:55.658 --> 17:57.577
One on the verge of

17:55.658 --> 17:57.577
beating Bobby Axelrod

17:57.618 --> 17:59.913
and thumping his chest

17:57.618 --> 17:59.913
in triumph.

18:00.788 --> 18:03.207
What, did the meeting

18:00.788 --> 18:03.207
with Winslow fall through?

18:04.291 --> 18:07.003
Meeting's lined up,

18:04.291 --> 18:07.003
but I'm not.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.922
I'm not sure

18:07.045 --> 18:08.922
I can let it happen.

18:08.963 --> 18:11.257
I've been thinking

18:08.963 --> 18:11.257
we've done enough,

18:11.298 --> 18:14.052
and Axe can cruise on

18:11.298 --> 18:14.052
in there and take it.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.095
No, no, no.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.305
We need the rabbit

18:16.136 --> 18:18.305
zipping around the rail,

18:18.347 --> 18:20.725
so the greyhound

18:18.347 --> 18:20.725
chases it headlong.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.393
-You're the rabbit.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.393
-Mm-hm.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.520
Without you, maybe he

18:22.435 --> 18:24.520
stops and thinks about it

18:24.562 --> 18:26.022
instead of lunging.

18:28.649 --> 18:29.943
[exhales]

18:31.485 --> 18:34.154
You don't know if you can walk

18:31.485 --> 18:34.154
your daughters through the door.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.951
Deploy them like that.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.951
That's what this is.

18:38.993 --> 18:40.244
[sighs]

18:40.286 --> 18:41.996
Look, I get it.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.581
I'm living it with my old man.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.249
It's a little different.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.249
He's hardly an innocent.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.710
True. But...

18:47.752 --> 18:49.587
you can't really

18:47.752 --> 18:49.587
say you're playing

18:49.629 --> 18:51.965
unless you're willing to put

18:49.629 --> 18:51.965
your highest-value pieces

18:52.006 --> 18:53.633
on the board.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.635
They're not pieces.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.635
They're my children.

18:55.676 --> 18:56.970
My first charge

18:55.676 --> 18:56.970
in this world

18:57.011 --> 18:58.387
is to protect them,

18:58.429 --> 19:00.598
not set them off

18:58.429 --> 19:00.598
like flashbang grenades.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.683
You are protecting them.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.978
Better, you're arming them

19:02.725 --> 19:04.978
to protect themselves.

19:05.019 --> 19:07.146
Yes, a consequence

19:05.019 --> 19:07.146
of this action might be

19:07.187 --> 19:09.732
that they become wary,

19:07.187 --> 19:09.732
less open.

19:09.774 --> 19:12.359
That may be of some

19:09.774 --> 19:12.359
benefit in business.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.445
But I'm not doing this

19:12.401 --> 19:14.445
as a teaching tool.

19:14.487 --> 19:18.324
I'm doing it for my own aims

19:14.487 --> 19:18.324
and that is too bitter a lesson.

19:18.365 --> 19:20.868
[whispers] You can't safeguard

19:18.365 --> 19:20.868
your kids from pain.

19:21.702 --> 19:24.664
But you can protect

19:21.702 --> 19:24.664
them from evil.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.499
And we both know

19:26.540 --> 19:28.250
that's what Axe is.

19:28.292 --> 19:31.253
And that's what a world is

19:28.292 --> 19:31.253
that bows before him.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.756
They're how he knows

19:31.295 --> 19:33.756
you're serious.

19:34.632 --> 19:36.801
And that it hurts you

19:34.632 --> 19:36.801
to use them...

19:38.427 --> 19:40.513
that's why you're

19:38.427 --> 19:40.513
the man you are.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.230
Don't do it.

19:51.149 --> 19:53.860
Godammit! Diego is fired.

19:53.901 --> 19:55.987
He only tipped me off

19:53.901 --> 19:55.987
because I told him

19:56.029 --> 19:57.738
I was worried about you

19:56.029 --> 19:57.738
taking the car out

19:57.780 --> 19:59.365
while still recovering.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.492
He cares about

19:59.406 --> 20:01.492
your well-being, as do I.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.996
Touching, but I'm fit

20:01.534 --> 20:04.996
as Charles Atlas in '53.

20:05.038 --> 20:08.332
Well, then do

20:05.038 --> 20:08.332
to Axe and company

20:08.374 --> 20:10.668
what Mr. Atlas would

20:08.374 --> 20:10.668
do a ThighMaster.

20:11.460 --> 20:12.753
Squeeze him.

20:12.795 --> 20:14.839
Atlas, good as he was, is dead,

20:14.881 --> 20:17.591
and so is any chance of me

20:14.881 --> 20:17.591
doing what you want.

20:17.633 --> 20:20.386
Besides, his gag

20:17.633 --> 20:20.386
was isometrics,

20:20.427 --> 20:23.139
and it was that

20:20.427 --> 20:23.139
pretty blonde gal,

20:23.181 --> 20:25.683
Suzanne Somers, who made

20:23.181 --> 20:25.683
with the ThighMaster.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.811
No matter.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.811
I'm here to warn you.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.688
Don't be their rubber stamp.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.149
Take your duties

20:30.730 --> 20:33.149
more seriously than that.

20:33.191 --> 20:34.817
I know my duty. Always have.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.736
That's why you had food

20:34.859 --> 20:36.736
in your belly

20:36.777 --> 20:38.487
and a roof over your head

20:38.529 --> 20:41.824
and monogrammed boxer shorts

20:38.529 --> 20:41.824
in your closet.

20:41.866 --> 20:44.284
I will advise with discretion

20:44.326 --> 20:45.953
-and discernment.

20:44.326 --> 20:45.953
-[scoffs]

20:45.995 --> 20:48.288
Now whether it's what

20:45.995 --> 20:48.288
you want or not

20:48.330 --> 20:49.916
isn't my problem.

20:49.957 --> 20:52.085
You're so desperate

20:49.957 --> 20:52.085
to stay relevant,

20:52.126 --> 20:54.294
to stay in the game.

20:54.336 --> 20:57.339
You can't see that the game

20:54.336 --> 20:57.339
has passed you by--

20:57.381 --> 20:59.967
Willie Mays in center

20:57.381 --> 20:59.967
field for the Mets,

21:00.009 --> 21:03.179
misunderstanding the dewy eyes

21:00.009 --> 21:03.179
in the crowd for love.

21:03.221 --> 21:05.181
[laughs] Oh, sonny boy.

21:05.223 --> 21:09.351
You just never understood me

21:05.223 --> 21:09.351
or the Say Hey Kid.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.896
You play until your feet break.

And they carry you off

21:13.439 --> 21:16.859

21:16.901 --> 21:19.403
And if that's not

21:16.901 --> 21:19.403

22:10.997 --> 22:12.706
And Winslow?

22:12.748 --> 22:15.709
She's melting like a pad

22:12.748 --> 22:15.709
of butter on a short stack.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.170
I'll go get into final terms

22:17.211 --> 22:18.754

22:18.796 --> 22:20.464
Good.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.969
And if the account is seized,

22:23.342 --> 22:24.969
then the bank is liable...

22:25.011 --> 22:26.679

22:49.576 --> 22:51.120
Okay.

22:51.162 --> 22:53.914
Doing this in person,

22:51.162 --> 22:53.914
nice and official.

22:53.956 --> 22:57.375
So do you want to report

22:53.956 --> 22:57.375
what Delaware banking laws

22:57.417 --> 22:58.961
Axe Bank has violated?

22:59.003 --> 23:00.880
Or should I just read

22:59.003 --> 23:00.880
from the list

23:00.921 --> 23:02.673
and you nod and sign?

23:09.387 --> 23:11.057
Nothing to report.

23:13.184 --> 23:15.561
So he hasn't violated any laws?

23:15.602 --> 23:17.313
None that I'm aware of.

23:19.273 --> 23:23.569
No regulations on

23:19.273 --> 23:23.569

23:26.947 --> 23:29.950
Has he painted

23:26.947 --> 23:29.950
outside the lines?

23:29.992 --> 23:32.370
On the contrary,

23:29.992 --> 23:32.370

They're all set up for

at which point

23:43.214 --> 23:45.007

23:45.049 --> 23:47.467
we sweep them up together

23:45.049 --> 23:47.467

23:47.509 --> 23:49.720
I can't report what hasn't

23:47.509 --> 23:49.720
happened regardless

23:49.762 --> 23:51.347
of my son's plans.

23:51.389 --> 23:55.433
I can only discharge

23:51.389 --> 23:55.433

23:56.518 --> 23:58.896
You understand that if

23:56.518 --> 23:58.896
this goes to prosecution,

23:58.938 --> 24:01.982
you are wrapping yourself

23:58.938 --> 24:01.982
right up in it?

24:02.024 --> 24:03.776
Gotcha.

24:03.817 --> 24:06.153
And my formal

24:03.817 --> 24:06.153
recommendation is,

24:06.195 --> 24:09.115
lift the probationary terms.

24:09.156 --> 24:10.950

24:12.868 --> 24:14.870
I'm not gonna pretend

24:12.868 --> 24:14.870
that I'm not confused,

clear of your fucked-up family.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.297
Okay.

24:24.338 --> 24:25.881
Axe Bank has passed

24:24.338 --> 24:25.881
its probation.

This bottle of d'Yquem

24:38.894 --> 24:41.897
Axe wanted you to enjoy

24:41.939 --> 24:44.275
is from the year you were born.

24:44.317 --> 24:46.735
These grapes have made

24:44.317 --> 24:46.735
the same journey you have.

24:53.326 --> 24:55.869

Hard to find those bottles.

24:57.246 --> 24:58.622

24:58.664 --> 25:00.791

25:05.921 --> 25:07.714

25:08.841 --> 25:10.676

25:10.717 --> 25:12.845

25:10.717 --> 25:12.845
cannabis company.

25:12.886 --> 25:14.596
Never been a tea smoker.

25:14.638 --> 25:17.099
Never loved the

25:14.638 --> 25:17.099
culture surrounding it either.

25:17.141 --> 25:19.101
And I don't see myself

25:17.141 --> 25:19.101
as being the first

25:19.143 --> 25:20.769
to break this

25:19.143 --> 25:20.769
particular barrier.

25:20.811 --> 25:22.813
You know, there are

25:20.811 --> 25:22.813
no commercials for pot.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.232
I can't really picture myself

25:22.855 --> 25:25.232
on the cover of<i> High Times.</i>

25:25.274 --> 25:27.193
What about

25:25.274 --> 25:27.193
<i>Fortune? Forbes?</i>

25:27.234 --> 25:30.196
You'd be on all of them,

25:27.234 --> 25:30.196
like Springsteen in 75.

25:30.237 --> 25:31.905
That was<i> Time</i>

25:30.237 --> 25:31.905

25:31.947 --> 25:33.240

25:33.282 --> 25:34.783
No, no. It made him.

25:34.825 --> 25:36.327
Took him to the next level.

25:36.369 --> 25:38.412
I'd be a pariah

25:36.369 --> 25:38.412
amongst other networks

25:38.454 --> 25:40.373
and likely the FCC.

25:40.414 --> 25:41.999
For about five minutes.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.876
Then they'd be looking

25:42.041 --> 25:43.876
to catch up.

25:43.917 --> 25:45.627
Pretty picture.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.671
Thing is I've already got

25:45.669 --> 25:47.671
my board seat on the bank.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.923
I've already got enough

25:47.713 --> 25:49.923
of everything I need.

25:49.965 --> 25:51.967
Why should I put myself for it?

25:52.009 --> 25:53.802
For your daughter.

25:53.844 --> 25:55.471
We heard whispers

25:53.844 --> 25:55.471
she's running for Congress

25:55.513 --> 25:57.515
and that she's refusing

25:55.513 --> 25:57.515
to take your money,

25:57.555 --> 25:59.308
wants to look self-made.

25:59.350 --> 26:01.310
I admire my daughter

25:59.350 --> 26:01.310
and her convictions.

26:01.352 --> 26:04.188
Yes. But you also

26:01.352 --> 26:04.188
want her to win.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.648
So... Axe will see to it

26:04.230 --> 26:06.648
that enough money

26:06.690 --> 26:09.026
is funneled to her campaign

26:06.690 --> 26:09.026

26:09.068 --> 26:12.363
Squad catnip,

26:12.405 --> 26:14.532
but enough in total to bury

26:14.572 --> 26:16.658
any and all of her opponents.

26:18.369 --> 26:20.746
Long as she doesn't know,

26:18.369 --> 26:20.746
she'll appreciate that.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.580
And I will too.

26:22.622 --> 26:23.957
Good.

26:28.254 --> 26:30.714
[Wags] Miss Winslow, this,

26:28.254 --> 26:30.714

26:30.756 --> 26:32.716
the most expensive

26:32.758 --> 26:34.218

26:42.642 --> 26:45.187
but never heard it.

How the hell did<i> you</i> get it?

26:49.858 --> 26:51.402
Don't ask me how he got it.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.529
Ask him.

26:53.571 --> 26:55.531
<i>Don't ask me either.</i>

26:55.573 --> 26:57.241
<i>I thought you would appreciate</i>

26:57.283 --> 26:59.159
<i>Never get too big and too loud?</i>

26:59.201 --> 27:02.329
Maybe. But his mistake was being

26:59.201 --> 27:02.329
in the wrong drug business.

27:02.371 --> 27:05.249
One that divided people instead

27:02.371 --> 27:05.249
of bringing them together.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.334
Don't do that.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.334
And don't gouge your customers

27:07.376 --> 27:09.044
and you can do

27:07.376 --> 27:09.044
this thing forever.

27:09.086 --> 27:10.588
Never do, never would.

27:10.628 --> 27:12.381
And I am in

27:10.628 --> 27:12.381
the right drug business.

27:12.423 --> 27:14.174
Brings people together

27:12.423 --> 27:14.174

27:19.179 --> 27:21.974
like a Wesleyan dorm room

27:28.688 --> 27:30.357
But like I told your people,

27:30.399 --> 27:32.443

is in receipt of your brief.

28:58.778 --> 29:00.113
[phone buzzes]

29:03.116 --> 29:05.118
[sighs]

29:05.160 --> 29:06.579
Excuse me.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.579
I have to go.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.288
-Ms. Sacker?

29:06.620 --> 29:08.288
-It's nothing.

29:08.330 --> 29:10.082
Is that right?

29:10.123 --> 29:12.834
Why don't you fill me in

29:10.123 --> 29:12.834
on the exact brand of nothing?

29:15.588 --> 29:18.006
Franklin Sacker announces

29:15.588 --> 29:18.006
he's relaxing policies

29:18.048 --> 29:20.467
with regard to

29:18.048 --> 29:20.467
advertising cannabinoids.

29:20.509 --> 29:22.135
Singled out one company

29:20.509 --> 29:22.135
in particular

29:22.177 --> 29:24.137
with some sugar-sweet words.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.014
Let me guess.

29:26.056 --> 29:27.600
Fine Young Cannabis.

29:27.641 --> 29:29.059
[scoffs]

29:29.101 --> 29:30.477
I guess my father

29:29.101 --> 29:30.477
is not the only one

29:30.519 --> 29:31.978
Axe has roped in.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.564
Look, I know that

29:32.020 --> 29:33.564
your instinct will be

29:33.606 --> 29:35.357
to confront your dad,

29:33.606 --> 29:35.357
to warn him--

29:35.399 --> 29:36.483
I already warned him.

29:36.525 --> 29:38.026
With the Opportunity Zone.

29:38.068 --> 29:39.445
He ignored me.

29:38.068 --> 29:39.445
He should know better.

29:39.486 --> 29:41.113
Yes, he should.

29:41.154 --> 29:42.948
But perhaps he's been

29:41.154 --> 29:42.948
blinded by an Axelrod

29:42.989 --> 29:44.533
opportunity supernova.

29:44.575 --> 29:46.702
Only way to back him off is to

29:44.575 --> 29:46.702
let him know the law is coming.

29:46.744 --> 29:48.495
Uh... the thing about that is,

29:48.537 --> 29:50.872
if your dad backs

29:48.537 --> 29:50.872
out because he's rattled,

29:51.873 --> 29:53.417
Axe will rattle too.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.085
So...

29:55.127 --> 29:57.087
you gotta let him dangle.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.965
-Chuck--

29:57.129 --> 29:59.965
-Whole operation gets blown

30:00.006 --> 30:02.092
if one piece

30:00.006 --> 30:02.092
gets out of order.

30:06.179 --> 30:07.889
Shit!

30:07.931 --> 30:10.225
[sighs]

30:11.101 --> 30:12.645
-[snips cigar]

30:11.101 --> 30:12.645
-Hm.

30:12.686 --> 30:14.354
Uh, do you really have

30:12.686 --> 30:14.354
to do it that way?

30:14.396 --> 30:15.773
What if I just bite

30:14.396 --> 30:15.773
the end off?

30:15.814 --> 30:17.775
It'll be wet and uneven.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.610
That's just something

30:17.816 --> 30:19.610
you saw in a movie.

30:19.652 --> 30:21.403
It is something

30:19.652 --> 30:21.403
I saw in a movie.

30:21.445 --> 30:23.071
And when the Wolverine did it--

30:23.113 --> 30:25.532
We've been over this.

30:23.113 --> 30:25.532
You're not Wolverine.

30:25.574 --> 30:27.117
I can be.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.952
With the right diet

30:27.159 --> 30:28.952
and workout program.

30:28.994 --> 30:30.912
Yeah, and if I gargle enough,

30:28.994 --> 30:30.912
I can be Celine Dion.

30:33.373 --> 30:36.251
You going with a V-cutter?

30:33.373 --> 30:36.251
You'll wind up too deep.

30:36.293 --> 30:38.003
Something you've never

30:36.293 --> 30:38.003
heard before, Dollar Bill.

30:38.044 --> 30:39.505
[chuckles]

30:42.341 --> 30:43.883
[chuckles]

30:43.925 --> 30:45.427
I'm a punch cut man.

30:45.469 --> 30:48.013
Clean draw,

30:45.469 --> 30:48.013
prevents tar accumulation.

30:48.054 --> 30:49.348
[Victor] Too precious,

30:49.389 --> 30:50.974
too much chance of crumbling.

30:51.016 --> 30:52.643
I go guillotine all the way.

30:52.685 --> 30:54.728
One perfect, decisive chop.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.277
It's not fucking time!

31:04.697 --> 31:06.532
That's what Wags said at first,

31:06.573 --> 31:08.450
but then he passed

31:06.573 --> 31:08.450
them out to us.

31:09.284 --> 31:10.577
Because we won a round.

31:10.619 --> 31:12.329
Back in your pockets.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.955
You can hold on to 'em now

31:13.997 --> 31:16.166
but don't smoke 'em

31:13.997 --> 31:16.166
till Axe gives the word.

31:44.820 --> 31:47.364
I... like that

31:44.820 --> 31:47.364
you're giving them

31:47.406 --> 31:49.742
something to look forward to

31:47.406 --> 31:49.742
at the finish line.

31:49.783 --> 31:51.451
<i>The cigars.</i>

31:53.119 --> 31:55.247
Now, what are you

31:53.119 --> 31:55.247
giving yourself?

31:59.125 --> 32:01.169
[exhales]

32:02.212 --> 32:04.172
[smacks lips]

32:04.214 --> 32:05.924
You ever been to Fiji?

32:08.134 --> 32:10.804
No. But I know you have.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.514
Yeah. Last year,

32:13.766 --> 32:16.393
with Dean and Gordy.

32:13.766 --> 32:16.393
Came back early.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.645
Well, you said it was because

32:16.435 --> 32:18.645
the kids didn't like it.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.149
I didn't totally buy that.

32:24.067 --> 32:26.319
Yeah. Didn't think you did.

32:30.908 --> 32:33.201
And now, you know

32:30.908 --> 32:33.201
what I'm thinking about?

32:38.707 --> 32:43.587
The ocean there's the exact

32:38.707 --> 32:43.587
same temperature as the air.

32:45.422 --> 32:47.549
<i>And so when you walk</i>

32:45.422 --> 32:47.549
<i>into the water,</i>

32:47.591 --> 32:49.676
<i>you don't even feel it.</i>

32:53.096 --> 32:55.140
Fiji sounds...

32:55.181 --> 32:56.934
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:01.062 --> 33:02.606
[inhales]

33:02.648 --> 33:04.817
As soon as I get

33:02.648 --> 33:04.817
a clean bill health.

33:04.858 --> 33:06.693
But first, victory smokes.

33:10.363 --> 33:11.698
Yeah.

33:15.368 --> 33:16.954
Thanks for making

33:15.368 --> 33:16.954
the trek to the sticks.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.038
Oh, it's not far from

33:16.995 --> 33:19.038
where I grew up.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.333
My elementary school

33:19.080 --> 33:21.333
is right around the corner.

33:21.374 --> 33:23.752
Oh, you gonna make

33:21.374 --> 33:23.752
that stop next?

33:23.794 --> 33:26.254
I'm gonna wait to go with

33:23.794 --> 33:26.254
Leslie Stahl and the camera crew

33:26.296 --> 33:27.881
before the next election.

33:27.923 --> 33:30.425
Maybe I'll squirt

33:27.923 --> 33:30.425
some tears

33:30.467 --> 33:32.678
when I look at the jungle gym

33:30.467 --> 33:32.678
I broke a tooth on.

33:32.719 --> 33:34.888
-Hmm. I'll be sure to watch.

33:32.719 --> 33:34.888
-Hm.

33:34.930 --> 33:37.390
Came across something

33:34.930 --> 33:37.390
that might interest you though.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.393
Criminal behavior in Manhattan.

33:40.435 --> 33:42.103
Is Rhoades hiding in a closet?

33:42.145 --> 33:43.939
-[scoffs]

33:42.145 --> 33:43.939
-Are you distracting me

33:43.981 --> 33:46.358
while someone plants something

33:43.981 --> 33:46.358
in the exhaust of my car?

33:47.233 --> 33:49.194
Truth?

33:49.235 --> 33:51.154
Chuck has no idea

33:49.235 --> 33:51.154
I'm even doing this.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.456
Your father.

34:01.498 --> 34:02.541
Jesus.

34:05.293 --> 34:06.712
Why?

34:06.753 --> 34:08.213
I'll answer the "what"--

34:06.753 --> 34:08.213
price fixing.

34:08.254 --> 34:10.089
The evidence is in front of you.

34:10.131 --> 34:11.800
The only why I'll answer is,

34:13.010 --> 34:15.637
I don't want my

34:13.010 --> 34:15.637
fingerprints on this.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.931
As to why I need this done?

34:17.973 --> 34:19.766
Family shit.

34:19.808 --> 34:22.561
I thank God every day

34:19.808 --> 34:22.561
I grew up medium-poor.

34:22.602 --> 34:24.938
The ones with

34:22.602 --> 34:24.938
the Tiffany rattles

34:24.980 --> 34:27.190
could never stop

34:24.980 --> 34:27.190
warring with their own.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.985
Hmm. You know nothing

34:27.232 --> 34:29.985
about how I grew up.

34:31.319 --> 34:33.446
Yeah, we had some money.

34:33.488 --> 34:35.908
But I had to prove that

34:33.488 --> 34:35.908
I deserved my spot in the world

34:35.949 --> 34:37.951
every single day,

34:37.993 --> 34:41.621
much as you did

34:37.993 --> 34:41.621
in a different way.

34:41.663 --> 34:43.289
You don't go into

34:41.663 --> 34:43.289
the justice business

34:43.331 --> 34:44.750
because it's a fair world,

34:44.791 --> 34:46.960
you do it because

34:44.791 --> 34:46.960
you want to make it one.

34:48.169 --> 34:51.882
[phone buzzing]

34:51.924 --> 34:53.341
Yes.

34:53.383 --> 34:54.885
Are you ready

34:53.383 --> 34:54.885
to make your move?

34:54.927 --> 34:56.344
I already answered

34:54.927 --> 34:56.344
your question.

34:56.386 --> 34:57.971
And your people?

34:56.386 --> 34:57.971
I don't know them.

34:58.013 --> 34:59.973
-Can we trust them?

34:58.013 --> 34:59.973
-Can we trust anybody?

35:00.015 --> 35:02.225
Very few. And only

35:00.015 --> 35:02.225
one way to find out.

35:02.267 --> 35:03.268
[doorbell rings]

35:03.309 --> 35:04.310
My appointment's here.

35:04.352 --> 35:05.562
<i>Say hi from me.</i>

35:17.032 --> 35:19.284
My new office is only

35:17.032 --> 35:19.284
a few blocks away,

35:19.325 --> 35:21.411
but I guess you didn't

35:19.325 --> 35:21.411
want to be seen there.

35:22.328 --> 35:23.872
Congrats on the new job.

35:23.914 --> 35:25.999
The second life

35:23.914 --> 35:25.999
after Spartan-Ives.

35:28.043 --> 35:30.128
You always seem

35:28.043 --> 35:30.128
to play it tight.

35:30.169 --> 35:32.380
Like that about you.

35:32.422 --> 35:34.674
I might have been better off

35:32.422 --> 35:34.674
if I kept it locked down

35:34.716 --> 35:36.134
in the first place or...

35:37.343 --> 35:39.178
never came back.

35:39.220 --> 35:41.222
But the thing is,

35:41.264 --> 35:43.391
how many ports can

35:41.264 --> 35:43.391
you dock your yacht in

35:43.433 --> 35:45.268
before you get

35:43.433 --> 35:45.268
a little bit bored?

35:45.310 --> 35:46.603
Sixty.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.772
It's pretty close.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.857
Feels like you have

35:48.814 --> 35:50.857
a pitch for me.

35:50.899 --> 35:53.944
But if you want to sell me, you

35:50.899 --> 35:53.944
gotta loose your lips a little.

35:53.986 --> 35:56.321
Major player, very liquid

35:53.986 --> 35:56.321
in the cannabis space.

35:56.362 --> 35:57.322
You open to that?

35:57.363 --> 35:59.032
Open?

35:59.074 --> 36:01.242
I'm hippy flippin' right now.

36:01.284 --> 36:05.413
.25 G psilocybin

36:01.284 --> 36:05.413
with 1.5 mg MDMA booster.

36:06.247 --> 36:09.501
So I'm most assuredly open.

36:09.542 --> 36:11.544
In fact, if this is

36:09.542 --> 36:11.544
behind Axe's back,

36:11.586 --> 36:14.297
something I'd be

36:11.586 --> 36:14.297
taking from him...

36:15.132 --> 36:16.883
wide motherfucking open.

36:20.303 --> 36:22.263
I thought we had

36:20.303 --> 36:22.263
an understanding.

36:22.305 --> 36:24.265
I gave you an actual order,

36:24.307 --> 36:25.809
yet your father

36:24.307 --> 36:25.809
was just arrested.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.114
Don't pretend this

36:37.529 --> 36:39.114
is news to you.

36:39.156 --> 36:40.657
I told you I wouldn't

36:39.156 --> 36:40.657
alert him. I didn't.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.241
You took him off the field.

36:42.283 --> 36:44.161
A minor charge,

36:42.283 --> 36:44.161
some embarrassment,

36:44.202 --> 36:46.621
no jail time, to protect him

36:44.202 --> 36:46.621
from getting nailed

36:46.663 --> 36:48.247
as a board member in on the fix.

36:48.289 --> 36:49.791
Don't think that falls

36:48.289 --> 36:49.791
under our agreement.

36:49.833 --> 36:51.751
The one founded

36:49.833 --> 36:51.751
in transparency?

36:51.793 --> 36:53.962
It took a little while for

36:51.793 --> 36:53.962
that to stick on your side,

36:54.004 --> 36:55.588
so I guess I'm still

36:54.004 --> 36:55.588
catching up,

36:55.630 --> 36:56.840
but that shouldn't affect

36:55.630 --> 36:56.840
your main concern,

36:56.882 --> 36:58.717
Axlerod.

36:58.758 --> 37:01.178
Think of how this looks to him,

36:58.758 --> 37:01.178
like it was your move.

37:01.219 --> 37:04.222
Like you dinged my dad so

37:01.219 --> 37:04.222
Prince would stay in the lead.

37:04.263 --> 37:06.766
If this were truly a competition

37:04.263 --> 37:06.766
over the cannabis money

37:06.808 --> 37:08.393
that's exactly the

37:06.808 --> 37:08.393
kind of throat-cutting

37:08.434 --> 37:10.269
you would engage in.

37:10.311 --> 37:11.938
I helped sell it.

37:13.690 --> 37:14.983
You may be right.

37:15.025 --> 37:16.568
[exhales]

37:16.609 --> 37:19.654
But don't act like

37:16.609 --> 37:19.654
that's why you did it.

37:19.696 --> 37:21.781
We don't all enjoy sending

37:19.696 --> 37:21.781
our fathers to the wolves.

37:21.823 --> 37:23.282
We don't.

37:23.324 --> 37:25.160
But we do it,

37:25.202 --> 37:27.704
because we not only accomplish

37:25.202 --> 37:27.704
whatever we were after,

37:27.746 --> 37:30.248
we get the thing they wouldn't

37:27.746 --> 37:30.248
give us any other way...

37:30.289 --> 37:32.042
respect.

37:34.460 --> 37:35.670
[exhales]

37:35.712 --> 37:37.130
Oh, and by the way,

37:37.172 --> 37:39.966
Judge DeGiulio texted me

37:37.172 --> 37:39.966
about your brief.

37:40.008 --> 37:43.720
Quote, "Fucking seaworthy,"

37:40.008 --> 37:43.720
unquote. High praise.

37:47.348 --> 37:48.934
Congratulations.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.396
[scoffs]

37:59.027 --> 38:01.154
Have you still not been able

37:59.027 --> 38:01.154
to reach Franklin Sacker?

38:01.196 --> 38:03.281
Radio silence.

38:01.196 --> 38:03.281
His office can't even find him.

38:03.322 --> 38:05.324
But you do have

38:03.322 --> 38:05.324
a message from Bach.

38:05.366 --> 38:07.410
The Solicitor General has the

38:05.366 --> 38:07.410
brief in his filing for cert.

38:07.452 --> 38:08.870
He said you--

38:08.912 --> 38:10.747
Yeah, I know exactly

38:08.912 --> 38:10.747
what it means.

38:12.249 --> 38:16.044
I have another call.

38:12.249 --> 38:16.044
Mike Prince.

38:16.086 --> 38:19.005
<i>Bobby, I feel a little like</i>

38:16.086 --> 38:19.005
<i>Cathy Moriarty in</i> Raging Bull,

38:19.047 --> 38:20.673
the way you keep pursuing me

38:20.715 --> 38:22.467
even though you know

38:20.715 --> 38:22.467
it's no good for you.

38:22.508 --> 38:24.052
Weird way to start a call, Mike.

38:24.094 --> 38:25.887
<i>Well, I'm expanding</i>

38:24.094 --> 38:25.887
<i>my perspective.</i>

38:25.929 --> 38:28.932
I-- I've heard many times

38:25.929 --> 38:28.932
about Axe, the thought leader,

38:28.974 --> 38:31.726
the man ahead of the curve,

38:28.974 --> 38:31.726
doing his own thing.

38:31.768 --> 38:33.979
I don't know if he ever existed,

38:31.768 --> 38:33.979
but I haven't seen him.

38:34.020 --> 38:36.439
<i>The Axe I'm acquainted</i>

38:34.020 --> 38:36.439
<i>with is a pirate,</i>

38:36.481 --> 38:39.484
or in the lingua franca of

38:36.481 --> 38:39.484
your beloved New York streets,

38:39.525 --> 38:41.111
<i>a goniff.</i>

38:41.153 --> 38:44.156
You tried to steal

38:41.153 --> 38:44.156
from me again.

38:44.197 --> 38:45.657
It didn't work.

38:45.698 --> 38:47.659
<i>Your media advantage is gone.</i>

38:47.700 --> 38:50.078
<i>Winslow and I have wrapped up</i>

38:47.700 --> 38:50.078
<i>our negotiations.</i>

38:50.120 --> 38:52.164
And you know what

38:50.120 --> 38:52.164
you wound up with?

38:52.205 --> 38:54.958
Nothing in your

38:52.205 --> 38:54.958
hand but moonlight.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.585
I have strings attached

38:55.000 --> 38:57.585
to all of my fingers.

38:57.627 --> 38:59.462
When I yank 'em,

38:59.504 --> 39:01.631
you are gonna shake, rattle,

38:59.504 --> 39:01.631
and shit yourself.

39:13.685 --> 39:16.146
So this is what the inside of

39:13.685 --> 39:16.146
a therapist's office looks like.

39:16.188 --> 39:17.563
You've never been to therapy?

39:17.605 --> 39:18.982
Just fucking with you.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.859
Twice a week since I was 11.

39:22.110 --> 39:24.487
[sighs]

39:22.110 --> 39:24.487
I love the environment,

39:24.529 --> 39:27.324
like a model room

39:24.529 --> 39:27.324
in a department store.

39:27.365 --> 39:30.952
A focus group-tested

39:27.365 --> 39:30.952
simulacrum of cozy comfort,

39:30.994 --> 39:33.913
tasteful and personalized,

39:30.994 --> 39:33.913
but impersonal.

39:34.747 --> 39:36.415
I think this is where

39:34.747 --> 39:36.415
I feel most comfortable.

39:36.457 --> 39:39.044
-That's the idea.

39:36.457 --> 39:39.044
-Helpful.

39:39.085 --> 39:41.338
Because I have to share some

39:39.085 --> 39:41.338
shit that's making me feel

39:41.379 --> 39:44.049
seriously awk-ward,

39:44.090 --> 39:45.675
awkward.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.677
Yeah, I thought that's

39:45.717 --> 39:47.677
probably what you meant.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.888
I saw something

39:47.719 --> 39:49.888
I shouldn't have.

39:49.929 --> 39:51.806
And it's fucking me up.

39:51.848 --> 39:54.142
Normally, I keep

39:51.848 --> 39:54.142
that stuff to myself.

39:54.184 --> 39:56.019
Oof, what I have hidden

39:54.184 --> 39:56.019
about my mom from my grandma,

39:56.061 --> 39:58.730
and then also about

39:56.061 --> 39:58.730
my grandma from my mom.

39:58.771 --> 39:59.856
Do you wanna go there?

39:59.898 --> 40:01.316
I don't know. Do you?

40:01.358 --> 40:03.360
I'm a trained shrink.

40:01.358 --> 40:03.360
So, always.

40:03.401 --> 40:06.404
But... I think that's not

40:03.401 --> 40:06.404
actually what's bothering you.

40:06.445 --> 40:08.198
[sighs]

40:08.240 --> 40:10.200
I can't sit on this

40:08.240 --> 40:10.200
if I wanna keep working here.

40:10.242 --> 40:12.118
And I think I want

40:10.242 --> 40:12.118
to keep working here.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.453
But if I talk about it,

40:12.160 --> 40:14.453
maybe I can't work here anyway.

40:14.495 --> 40:16.289
What type of a paradox is that?

40:16.331 --> 40:17.665
One that probably

40:16.331 --> 40:17.665
only gets better

40:17.707 --> 40:18.750
if you take a deep breath...

40:18.791 --> 40:20.085
[takes deep breath]

40:20.126 --> 40:22.295
...and actually tell me.

40:22.337 --> 40:24.381
I was in Taylor's office

40:22.337 --> 40:24.381
dropping stuff off

40:24.422 --> 40:26.465
and on their

40:24.422 --> 40:26.465
computer screen, ugh...

40:27.842 --> 40:29.594
Taylor had a meeting

40:27.842 --> 40:29.594
with Lawrence Boyd

40:29.635 --> 40:33.348
about a company we told

40:29.635 --> 40:33.348
Axe to pump the brakes on.

40:33.390 --> 40:36.059
Taylor went to a rival

40:33.390 --> 40:36.059
with the opposite advice?

40:36.101 --> 40:38.353
I don't wanna work in

40:36.101 --> 40:38.353
a place with secrets, lies,

40:38.395 --> 40:42.148
backstabbing, side-stabbing,

40:38.395 --> 40:42.148
any stabbing.

40:42.190 --> 40:43.858
Understandable. So I know

40:42.190 --> 40:43.858
how best to handle this.

40:43.900 --> 40:45.777
Are you confiding it

40:43.900 --> 40:45.777
to me in session

40:45.818 --> 40:48.613
or are you reporting to me

40:45.818 --> 40:48.613
as your boss at Mase Carbon?

40:48.654 --> 40:50.323
Whoa.

40:50.365 --> 40:53.159
You have made your

40:50.365 --> 40:53.159
life very complicated.

40:53.201 --> 40:56.037
I'm trying to make mine less so

40:53.201 --> 40:56.037
by offloading this.

40:56.079 --> 40:58.664
So... [chuckles]

40:56.079 --> 40:58.664
good luck with all of that.

41:05.422 --> 41:08.091
[sighs]

41:23.648 --> 41:24.857
I would like to have

41:23.648 --> 41:24.857
an abstract,

41:24.899 --> 41:26.567
hypothetical conversation

41:26.609 --> 41:28.861
about serving multiple masters.

41:28.903 --> 41:31.156
No, you don't.

41:28.903 --> 41:31.156
Not with me.

41:31.197 --> 41:32.490
If this were about Axe,

41:31.197 --> 41:32.490
you would say,

41:32.531 --> 41:34.451
"Axe, this is about Taylor."

41:34.492 --> 41:37.120
They did something you need

41:34.492 --> 41:37.120
to tell me without telling me.

41:37.162 --> 41:39.747
I really expected that

41:37.162 --> 41:39.747
to take a few more rounds.

41:39.789 --> 41:41.416
You're not the only person

41:39.789 --> 41:41.416
here who can solve a puzzle

41:41.458 --> 41:43.418
with just one letter

41:41.458 --> 41:43.418
on the board.

41:43.460 --> 41:46.712
I know when you want a drinking

41:43.460 --> 41:46.712
pal and when you have an agenda.

41:46.754 --> 41:48.923
Taylor went behind Axe's back

41:46.754 --> 41:48.923
to lay off the cannabis deal

41:48.965 --> 41:50.467
to a third party.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.135
Whoa, fuck. Who?

41:52.177 --> 41:53.386
Lawrence Boyd.

41:53.428 --> 41:55.347
Doubly fucked.

41:55.388 --> 41:57.140
I got it from here.

41:58.266 --> 42:00.143
I gotta ask you.

42:00.185 --> 42:01.769
Why aren't you on the phone

42:00.185 --> 42:01.769
with him right now?

42:01.811 --> 42:03.855
-Telling him about Taylor?

42:01.811 --> 42:03.855
-No.

42:03.896 --> 42:06.274
Trying to talk him out

42:03.896 --> 42:06.274
of taking on the cannabis money.

42:06.316 --> 42:07.775
You think he needs to be

42:06.316 --> 42:07.775
talked out of it?

42:07.817 --> 42:10.362
No. I think you

42:07.817 --> 42:10.362
think he does.

42:11.654 --> 42:15.325
Something's different, shifted.

42:16.993 --> 42:18.703
You're not divided

42:16.993 --> 42:18.703
between Axe and Taylor.

42:18.744 --> 42:20.913
You're divided

42:18.744 --> 42:20.913
between Axe and Axe.

42:20.955 --> 42:23.041
You don't want to be the

42:20.955 --> 42:23.041
one shouting him down anymore.

42:23.082 --> 42:25.377
Trying to tell him to ignore

42:23.082 --> 42:25.377
his instincts. Why not?

42:27.462 --> 42:29.255
Because that doesn't

42:27.462 --> 42:29.255
work with a-- a--

42:29.297 --> 42:30.382
A partner?

42:31.590 --> 42:33.385
I get it.

42:33.426 --> 42:35.345
If you and Axe are gonna have

42:33.426 --> 42:35.345
another kind of thing,

42:35.387 --> 42:36.929
you need to make peace

42:35.387 --> 42:36.929
with who he is

42:36.971 --> 42:38.431
and stop trying to change him.

42:40.266 --> 42:42.310
Is that what's going on?

42:42.352 --> 42:44.145
Have you made that peace?

42:47.065 --> 42:48.774
Thank you for

42:47.065 --> 42:48.774
taking this to him.

42:53.071 --> 42:55.114
[sighs]

42:59.327 --> 43:00.828
[Gramm] Hey, Chuck.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.671
Uh, I know that Sacker

43:06.000 --> 43:10.671
tipped you off about her dad.

43:10.713 --> 43:13.799
Now, you had your headline

43:10.713 --> 43:13.799
and your fun.

43:13.841 --> 43:16.344
You don't need to pick up

43:13.841 --> 43:16.344
a penalty flag

43:16.386 --> 43:18.388
for the fire hydrant

43:16.386 --> 43:18.388
celebration.

43:18.430 --> 43:21.558
Franklin Sacker and Axelrod.

43:21.599 --> 43:24.519
Your father and Delaware.

43:24.561 --> 43:27.063
It's all connected.

43:28.106 --> 43:31.650
Your Jeffersonian dinner theater

43:28.106 --> 43:31.650
was setting up a move.

43:32.569 --> 43:35.821
There was no ideological fight.

43:35.863 --> 43:38.157
It was masking scent on a snare.

43:38.199 --> 43:39.867
You're working with Prince

43:39.909 --> 43:41.327
-to bring down Axe.

43:39.909 --> 43:41.327
-[sighs]

43:41.369 --> 43:42.661
And now what? Hmm?

43:42.703 --> 43:44.663
You take this

43:42.703 --> 43:44.663
theory to him?

43:44.705 --> 43:46.665
Win his eternal gratitude?

43:46.707 --> 43:48.293
It'd be a real smile.

43:48.334 --> 43:50.169
Oh, fun factor's high,

43:48.334 --> 43:50.169
I'll grant you that.

43:50.211 --> 43:51.670
Sky fuckin' high.

43:51.712 --> 43:53.172
And I'd have

43:51.712 --> 43:53.172
him forever in my debt.

43:53.214 --> 43:55.133
-Powerful ally.

43:53.214 --> 43:55.133
-Hmm. For sure.

43:55.174 --> 43:58.052
But then you become Mike

43:55.174 --> 43:58.052
Prince's eternal enemy.

43:58.094 --> 43:59.095
Hmm. True.

43:59.137 --> 44:00.388
And mine.

44:00.430 --> 44:03.015
Hmm. All that power.

44:03.057 --> 44:04.434
And pettiness.

44:04.476 --> 44:06.102
Trained upon me.

44:06.144 --> 44:08.020
Every bit of it.

44:08.062 --> 44:09.522
So shoot your shot.

44:10.982 --> 44:14.235
Our turf war over

44:10.982 --> 44:14.235
criminal cases is over.

44:14.277 --> 44:16.195
I surrender.

44:16.237 --> 44:19.698
Like Captain Fehler

44:16.237 --> 44:19.698
on U-boat 234.

44:19.740 --> 44:22.743
From now on, you will clear all

44:19.740 --> 44:22.743
criminal cases with me?

44:22.785 --> 44:26.747
Yes. Provided you grant me

44:22.785 --> 44:26.747
one imminent arrest.

44:27.915 --> 44:30.918
Dawn Winslow

44:27.915 --> 44:30.918
and where she leads.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.753
Enjoy it.

44:35.507 --> 44:37.467
May be the only one

44:37.509 --> 44:39.260
for quite some time.

44:41.762 --> 44:42.763
[sighs]

44:42.805 --> 44:44.390
[door opens, closes]

44:48.769 --> 44:50.271
Your business

44:48.769 --> 44:50.271
makes money for Axe.

44:50.313 --> 44:51.772
So you won't be put out

44:50.313 --> 44:51.772
of business.

44:51.814 --> 44:53.441
There'll just be enough

44:51.814 --> 44:53.441
locks on it

44:53.483 --> 44:55.151
that you'll suffocate

44:53.483 --> 44:55.151
if you fight too hard.

44:55.193 --> 44:56.777
And who winds up

44:55.193 --> 44:56.777
holding the key?

44:56.819 --> 44:58.070
-Take a guess.

44:56.819 --> 44:58.070
-[Spyros] I have to approve

44:58.112 --> 45:00.281
any investment over seven figs.

45:00.323 --> 45:01.907
That's every investment.

45:01.949 --> 45:04.118
So I guess much like

45:01.949 --> 45:04.118
Andy Summers,

45:04.160 --> 45:06.496
I'm on top of every

45:04.160 --> 45:06.496
move you make.

45:06.538 --> 45:09.207
And you can no longer make soft

45:06.538 --> 45:09.207
dollar arrangements on your own.

45:09.248 --> 45:11.626
Those are my relationships

45:09.248 --> 45:11.626
with other firms.

45:11.668 --> 45:13.752
They're Hard Bob's

45:11.668 --> 45:13.752
relationships too now.

45:13.794 --> 45:16.381
Because they all

45:13.794 --> 45:16.381
clear through him.

45:16.422 --> 45:17.965
And what does Victor do?

45:18.007 --> 45:19.842
Whatever you do.

45:21.594 --> 45:23.346
I need to explain to Axe

45:21.594 --> 45:23.346
how these strictures--

45:23.388 --> 45:26.683
You don't talk to him.

45:23.388 --> 45:26.683
Or see him anymore.

45:26.723 --> 45:29.310
The only face you see is mine.

45:29.352 --> 45:31.020
Mine too.

45:39.945 --> 45:42.240
We need to clear the atmosphere.

45:42.281 --> 45:43.658
Victor, give us the room.

45:43.700 --> 45:45.784
-No can.

45:43.700 --> 45:45.784
-Give us the fucking room.

45:49.746 --> 45:51.082
Okay.

45:57.630 --> 45:59.090
We're supposed to be partners,

45:59.131 --> 46:00.799
but you freelanced

45:59.131 --> 46:00.799
on the Boyd play.

46:00.841 --> 46:02.927
You're tracking my schedule now?

46:00.841 --> 46:02.927
What the fuck?

46:02.968 --> 46:05.513
No. How the fuck do I excuse

46:02.968 --> 46:05.513
your lack of trust in me?

46:05.555 --> 46:07.848
We may be looking at

46:05.555 --> 46:07.848
a foundational question here,

46:07.890 --> 46:09.350
because are we partners?

46:09.392 --> 46:11.603
On paper, kinda.

46:09.392 --> 46:11.603
In person, same.

46:11.644 --> 46:13.563
Sometimes you act like it

46:11.644 --> 46:13.563
in the same way

46:13.605 --> 46:15.732
you once acted as my

46:13.605 --> 46:15.732
shrink or my friend.

46:15.772 --> 46:18.443
But Axe really controls it all,

46:15.772 --> 46:18.443
just like he always did.

46:18.484 --> 46:20.612
So where does that leave me?

46:23.364 --> 46:25.742
Well, sounds like

46:23.364 --> 46:25.742
at battle stations again.

46:25.782 --> 46:28.661
Is that really what you want?

46:28.703 --> 46:30.037
[sighs]

46:30.079 --> 46:31.038
No.

46:31.080 --> 46:32.707
Me neither.

46:32.749 --> 46:34.417
I want to believe

46:32.749 --> 46:34.417
the best of you

46:34.459 --> 46:36.502
because that's the kind of world

46:34.459 --> 46:36.502
I want to live in.

46:36.544 --> 46:38.588
And like it or not,

46:36.544 --> 46:38.588
we're lashed together.

46:40.881 --> 46:42.216
So?

46:43.760 --> 46:46.262
I guess tell Victor to

46:43.760 --> 46:46.262
set up his fucking desk.

46:51.684 --> 46:53.018
[door opens, closes]

46:56.522 --> 46:58.357
I come bearing gifts, again.

46:58.399 --> 47:00.359
Shocked you'd want to

46:58.399 --> 47:00.359
show your face after

47:00.401 --> 47:02.819
your boss sold me something

47:00.401 --> 47:02.819
he couldn't deliver.

47:02.861 --> 47:04.489
We've come back

47:02.861 --> 47:04.489
to you with an offer

47:04.530 --> 47:06.407
we don't need anyone else for.

47:04.530 --> 47:06.407
Three percent.

47:06.449 --> 47:08.493
-Interest on my money.

47:06.449 --> 47:08.493
-The going rate at most banks

47:08.534 --> 47:10.035
right now is close to zero.

47:10.077 --> 47:12.037
You just need to get

47:10.077 --> 47:12.037
your cash safe

47:12.079 --> 47:14.332
and in the system,

47:12.079 --> 47:14.332
and we're offering you icing.

47:14.373 --> 47:17.752
Nice. But not enough

47:14.373 --> 47:17.752
to walk away from Prince.

47:17.794 --> 47:19.754
Axe thought you'd say that.

47:19.796 --> 47:21.506
So there's also this.

47:23.174 --> 47:26.552
I did let my subscription

47:23.174 --> 47:26.552
to Architectural Digest lapse.

47:28.471 --> 47:31.015
[Axe]<i> The house.</i>

47:28.471 --> 47:31.015
<i>My country house.</i>

47:31.974 --> 47:33.434
It is now your house.

47:33.476 --> 47:34.851
<i>This is my offer</i>

47:34.893 --> 47:36.228
<i>and there's no shopping it.</i>

47:36.270 --> 47:37.938
<i>I want your answer right now.</i>

47:37.980 --> 47:40.608
I wanted to give

47:37.980 --> 47:40.608
you something personally,

47:40.650 --> 47:42.318
<i>something that matters to me</i>

47:42.360 --> 47:44.111
so you know the kind of

47:42.360 --> 47:44.111
partner that I will be

47:44.153 --> 47:45.780
-for you down the road.

47:44.153 --> 47:45.780
<i>-You're on the water.</i>

47:45.822 --> 47:47.824
Why do you need an

47:45.822 --> 47:47.824
Olympic-sized indoor pool?

47:47.864 --> 47:49.575
You'll appreciate it

47:47.864 --> 47:49.575
come October.

47:49.617 --> 47:51.494
I think I will.

47:51.536 --> 47:54.580
But I can't go through the whole

47:51.536 --> 47:54.580
due diligence process again.

47:54.622 --> 47:56.541
Prince spent the last

47:54.622 --> 47:56.541
few weeks digging through

47:56.582 --> 47:58.710
my entire business

47:56.582 --> 47:58.710
and I need to be done.

47:58.751 --> 48:01.671
Just cross out Prince's name in

47:58.751 --> 48:01.671
the deal and put mine in.

48:01.713 --> 48:05.550
And I will use his due diligence

48:01.713 --> 48:05.550
as my own and sign.

48:07.926 --> 48:09.721
We have a deal.

48:10.555 --> 48:12.931
Good.

48:12.973 --> 48:15.892
[Wags]<i> Now I can get back</i>

48:12.973 --> 48:15.892
<i>to more pressing business.</i>

48:35.580 --> 48:38.290
[forklift beeping]

49:05.192 --> 49:07.111
[doorbell rings]

49:07.152 --> 49:09.655
One last how-do-you-do before

49:07.152 --> 49:09.655
I meet Big Daddy? For luck?

49:12.617 --> 49:14.076
Hmm.

49:16.328 --> 49:17.496
[door opens]

49:22.794 --> 49:24.378
Wagner!

49:24.420 --> 49:26.881
Hey there, Dad.

49:26.923 --> 49:28.716
Is it too soon?

49:28.758 --> 49:31.803
I look forward to long talks,

49:28.758 --> 49:31.803
throwin' the ball around.

49:32.637 --> 49:34.847
Is this the man you've

49:32.637 --> 49:34.847
been telling me about?

49:34.889 --> 49:37.099
Wags, what is going on?

49:37.141 --> 49:38.975
You two know each other?

49:39.017 --> 49:40.603
Your old man threw down

49:39.017 --> 49:40.603
the gauntlet,

49:40.645 --> 49:42.521
had me dress up

49:40.645 --> 49:42.521
like Carol Channing

49:42.563 --> 49:45.357
only to spit in my eye.

49:45.399 --> 49:48.444
I told him what

49:45.399 --> 49:48.444
I would do in his eye.

49:48.486 --> 49:50.154
And now I have.

49:50.195 --> 49:54.199
Wagner, you walking

49:50.195 --> 49:54.199
Special Victims Unit.

49:54.241 --> 49:56.327
You defiled my offspring.

49:56.368 --> 49:59.914
No doubt with a criminal

49:56.368 --> 49:59.914
combination of mendacity,

49:59.956 --> 50:01.582
manipulation, and Spanish fly.

50:01.624 --> 50:03.083
[chuckles] Oh no.

50:03.125 --> 50:05.043
You raised a fine piece

50:03.125 --> 50:05.043
of daughter.

50:05.085 --> 50:07.045
She knows her own mind and body.

50:07.087 --> 50:09.924
And what a live body it is.

50:09.966 --> 50:13.218
You knew he was my father

50:09.966 --> 50:13.218
the entire time?

50:13.260 --> 50:15.179
That's what this has

50:13.260 --> 50:15.179
always been about?

50:15.220 --> 50:16.597
The middle was real.

50:16.639 --> 50:19.517
You motherfucker.

50:20.309 --> 50:22.353
If you think my father

50:20.309 --> 50:22.353
knows how to get revenge,

50:22.394 --> 50:25.230
you have no idea

50:22.394 --> 50:25.230
what I'm capable of.

50:25.272 --> 50:28.024
Wait, wait. Chelz.

50:28.066 --> 50:30.611
[groans]

50:30.653 --> 50:34.114
I went looking in earnest

50:30.653 --> 50:34.114
and stopped on your profile.

50:35.950 --> 50:38.202
Then I recognized

50:35.950 --> 50:38.202
your picture and your name.

50:38.243 --> 50:39.578
[chuckles] Like I said,

50:39.620 --> 50:41.121
the middle was real.

50:41.163 --> 50:43.749
-Don't bother, Wagner.

50:41.163 --> 50:43.749
-Shut up, Mick.

50:43.791 --> 50:45.918
Let him try and talk his

50:43.791 --> 50:45.918
way out of this, Dad.

50:45.960 --> 50:48.212
It'll make it sweeter.

50:48.253 --> 50:50.422
[Wags] What I felt

50:48.253 --> 50:50.422
for you wasn't just

50:50.464 --> 50:51.590
lust.

50:51.632 --> 50:54.760
Or amusement. Or respect.

50:54.802 --> 50:57.471
I had to follow through

50:54.802 --> 50:57.471
on my revenge because,

50:57.513 --> 50:58.723
well, because it's who I am.

50:58.764 --> 51:00.265
I just fuckin' had to.

51:00.307 --> 51:02.058
But it was hard.

51:02.100 --> 51:04.311
[chuckling] It was fantastic,

51:04.353 --> 51:06.480
but really, really hard.

51:06.522 --> 51:07.940
Because...

51:10.234 --> 51:12.737
I don't want to lose you.

51:12.778 --> 51:14.947
And if there's any way you

51:12.778 --> 51:14.947
could see to forgive me

51:16.448 --> 51:17.909
and give us a real shot--

51:17.950 --> 51:19.952
Wagner, you're disturbed.

51:21.037 --> 51:24.040
Every great love story

51:21.037 --> 51:24.040
springs from the forbidden...

51:24.080 --> 51:26.918
comes true against all

51:24.080 --> 51:26.918
obstacles of good family

51:26.959 --> 51:29.085
and good taste because

51:26.959 --> 51:29.085
sometimes a heart

51:29.127 --> 51:31.380
finds another heart

51:29.127 --> 51:31.380
it needs to be with.

51:34.842 --> 51:36.510
You had me at the middle.

51:49.607 --> 51:50.900
[typing]

52:05.039 --> 52:06.373
Peach,

52:06.415 --> 52:08.250
kill the smoke detectors.

52:10.461 --> 52:12.504
<i>I have had-- We have had</i>

52:13.297 --> 52:15.257
so many wins.

52:15.299 --> 52:17.718
<i>There were so many times</i>

52:15.299 --> 52:17.718
<i>that I almost pulled out</i>

52:17.760 --> 52:19.720
<i>the Auerbachs.</i>

52:19.762 --> 52:21.639
Glad as hell that we waited.

52:21.680 --> 52:24.308
Now light 'em up like you're

52:21.680 --> 52:24.308
that goddamn Grucci family.

52:24.349 --> 52:26.268
[all cheer]

52:26.310 --> 52:28.896
I'm strictly forbidden

52:26.310 --> 52:28.896
to smoke right now,

52:28.938 --> 52:30.815
<i>but I'm gonna do it anyway.</i>

52:32.817 --> 52:33.859
Fuck yeah!

52:41.199 --> 52:42.868
Axe swallowed it.

52:42.910 --> 52:44.745
He actually closed on

52:42.910 --> 52:44.745
that money.

52:46.038 --> 52:48.373
Didn't do his own due diligence,

52:46.038 --> 52:48.373
just accepted Prince's

52:48.415 --> 52:50.918
and took it down like

52:48.415 --> 52:50.918
sushi laced with polonium.

52:50.960 --> 52:52.461
Wouldn't have happened

52:50.960 --> 52:52.461
without the efforts

52:52.503 --> 52:54.254
of everyone in this room.

52:54.296 --> 52:56.340
Or without great personal cost.

52:56.381 --> 52:58.425
As all great triumphs require.

52:59.927 --> 53:01.470
Liz and Gail are here.

53:01.512 --> 53:03.806
They're coming up

53:01.512 --> 53:03.806
in the private elevator.

53:03.848 --> 53:05.516
I pray that when they know

53:03.848 --> 53:05.516
what I've done,

53:05.557 --> 53:07.183
that they'll understand.

53:07.225 --> 53:08.727
We should go anyway.

53:08.769 --> 53:10.729
Time to arrest Winslow.

53:10.771 --> 53:13.273
A legal cannabis seller cannot

53:10.771 --> 53:13.273
make up for seasonal shortfall

53:13.315 --> 53:16.152
by adding in a black-market

53:13.315 --> 53:16.152
crop of Humboldt County

53:16.192 --> 53:17.736
with the legit stuff.

53:17.778 --> 53:19.571
You've combed through all

53:17.778 --> 53:19.571
the possibilities.

53:19.613 --> 53:21.281
Looked into every

53:19.613 --> 53:21.281
legal cannabis company

53:21.323 --> 53:23.492
until you found the one CEO

53:21.323 --> 53:23.492
who also happened

53:23.534 --> 53:25.243
to be running

53:23.534 --> 53:25.243
a criminal enterprise.

53:25.285 --> 53:27.163
She's no longer

53:25.285 --> 53:27.163
a business pioneer.

53:27.203 --> 53:29.247
Just another drug dealer

53:27.203 --> 53:29.247
moving major weight.

53:30.875 --> 53:33.002
I'm betting she won't hold up

53:30.875 --> 53:33.002
long before flipping on Axe.

53:33.044 --> 53:35.046
I'll leave with you.

53:35.087 --> 53:36.964
In the name of decorum, let me

53:35.087 --> 53:36.964
show you the regular elevators.

53:52.730 --> 53:54.272
[door opens]

53:54.314 --> 53:56.859
[laughing and

53:54.314 --> 53:56.859
talking indistinctly]

53:56.901 --> 53:59.153
So have the contracts

53:56.901 --> 53:59.153
been signed yet?

54:00.946 --> 54:02.656
We didn't land the deal.

54:02.698 --> 54:05.743
Winslow went with Bobby

54:02.698 --> 54:05.743
Axelrod's bank.

54:06.994 --> 54:08.579
Shit.

54:08.620 --> 54:10.622
Sorry, Dad.

54:08.620 --> 54:10.622
I thought we did really well.

54:10.664 --> 54:12.248
Is it done-done?

54:10.664 --> 54:12.248
I mean, can we call

54:12.290 --> 54:13.709
and ask her

54:12.290 --> 54:13.709
for another meeting?

54:13.751 --> 54:15.627
That's exactly

54:13.751 --> 54:15.627
the right attitude.

54:15.669 --> 54:17.755
Never quit.

54:15.669 --> 54:17.755
Never take no for an answer.

54:17.796 --> 54:19.423
Remember that.

54:22.760 --> 54:24.929
Actually, no, I can't.

54:22.760 --> 54:24.929
I won't lie to you.

54:27.305 --> 54:30.017
This all worked out exactly

54:27.305 --> 54:30.017
how I knew it would.

54:31.060 --> 54:33.020
Wait, what?

54:33.062 --> 54:35.022
You wanted to lose?

54:35.064 --> 54:37.233
I needed Bobby Axelrod

54:35.064 --> 54:37.233
to win the deal.

54:37.273 --> 54:38.400
To bank the money.

54:38.442 --> 54:40.027
You used us?

54:40.069 --> 54:41.820
To what? Like, bait him in?

54:41.862 --> 54:43.279
Gail, he didn't do that.

54:43.321 --> 54:45.116
You didn't do that.

54:45.157 --> 54:46.575
[sighs]

54:47.993 --> 54:49.369
Wait, one sec.

54:49.411 --> 54:52.248
Why did you want Axelrod to win?

54:52.288 --> 54:54.041
So he'd go to jail.

54:54.083 --> 54:56.210
Because that's also

54:54.083 --> 54:56.210
where Winslow's going.

54:56.252 --> 54:58.336
Believe me when I tell you,

54:58.378 --> 55:00.089
Mike Prince and his daughters

55:00.131 --> 55:01.632
made the world

55:00.131 --> 55:01.632
a better place today.

55:01.673 --> 55:03.134
You played us.

55:03.175 --> 55:04.802
Dangled us out there

55:03.175 --> 55:04.802
like assholes--

55:04.843 --> 55:07.263
Hey, you wanted

55:04.843 --> 55:07.263
to know what it felt like.

55:07.303 --> 55:08.597
And come on,

55:07.303 --> 55:08.597
you took one meeting.

55:08.639 --> 55:10.224
We practiced our

55:08.639 --> 55:10.224
pitch all night.

55:10.266 --> 55:12.059
Well, you got some experience.

55:12.101 --> 55:14.603
Maybe rethink Europe, the

55:12.101 --> 55:14.603
JetBlue version, if you want.

55:14.645 --> 55:16.272
[scoffs] Save it, Dad.

55:16.312 --> 55:17.773
We're starting to know

55:16.312 --> 55:17.773
what your old partner

55:17.815 --> 55:19.108
must have felt like--

55:19.150 --> 55:20.859
Hey, that crap

55:19.150 --> 55:20.859
is over the line.

55:20.901 --> 55:22.569
This is business.

55:20.901 --> 55:22.569
This is what not having

55:22.611 --> 55:24.196
a soft landing feels like.

55:24.238 --> 55:25.906
You tear your butt

55:24.238 --> 55:25.906
when you hit the ground.

55:25.948 --> 55:27.866
We didn't even

55:25.948 --> 55:27.866
have a chance to win.

55:27.908 --> 55:30.911
Yeah. This time the odds

55:27.908 --> 55:30.911
were stacked against you.

55:30.953 --> 55:32.704
Just like you said you wanted.

55:32.746 --> 55:35.457
Now you haven't

55:32.746 --> 55:35.457
been robbed of it.

55:35.499 --> 55:36.667
But, uh,

55:38.002 --> 55:39.377
next time you'll do better.

55:39.419 --> 55:41.379
I don't like this.

55:41.421 --> 55:43.924
Or your face right now, Dad.

55:43.966 --> 55:46.135
Yeah. This sucks.

55:46.177 --> 55:49.305
Yeah, Mike Prince, you are

55:46.177 --> 55:49.305
kind of sucking right now.

55:53.309 --> 55:54.685
[sighs]

56:01.317 --> 56:03.359
You know they roll them

56:01.317 --> 56:03.359
on their thighs,

56:03.401 --> 56:05.403
slow and steady.

56:05.445 --> 56:08.073
The sweat intermingles,

56:05.445 --> 56:08.073
which gives it a distinct--

56:08.115 --> 56:09.616
I can't decide if

56:08.115 --> 56:09.616
that makes it

56:09.658 --> 56:11.785
more or less appealing.

56:11.827 --> 56:13.787
I think less,

56:11.827 --> 56:13.787
but I want to think more.

56:13.829 --> 56:15.747
[elevator bell rings]

56:15.789 --> 56:18.292
I'm not much for group gropes

56:15.789 --> 56:18.292
but I'll smoke one with you.

56:19.084 --> 56:21.253
[sniffs]

56:34.808 --> 56:36.185
You should join the party.

56:36.227 --> 56:38.394
Heard that a lot

56:36.227 --> 56:38.394
of times in my life.

56:41.648 --> 56:43.275
Thank you for what you did.

56:43.317 --> 56:45.027
I know you were scared

56:43.317 --> 56:45.027
to go to Wendy like that.

56:45.069 --> 56:47.238
-But we needed it.

56:45.069 --> 56:47.238
-Hmm.

56:47.279 --> 56:49.823
Maybe the most

56:47.279 --> 56:49.823
exhilarating moment of my life.

56:49.865 --> 56:51.825
[chuckles]

56:51.867 --> 56:55.204
That and when I found

56:51.867 --> 56:55.204
a Tamagotchi emulator, oof.

57:01.210 --> 57:03.212
God, it just feels

57:01.210 --> 57:03.212
like old times.

57:03.254 --> 57:05.547
You know, there's

57:03.254 --> 57:05.547
been so much shit,

57:05.589 --> 57:07.423
so much bad blood.

57:07.465 --> 57:08.967
-[phone buzzing]

57:07.465 --> 57:08.967
-But a pure win like this,

57:09.009 --> 57:11.303
after all we've been through?

57:11.345 --> 57:12.971
Fuck, I miss these days.

57:14.098 --> 57:17.226
The estimable

Zino Davidoff once said,

57:17.268 --> 57:19.519
"A cigar ought not

57:17.268 --> 57:19.519
to be smoked solely

57:19.561 --> 57:22.231
with the mouth,

but with the hand,

57:22.273 --> 57:24.524
with the eyes, with the spirit.

57:24.566 --> 57:25.776
Oh, Jesus.

57:25.817 --> 57:27.278
Wow.

57:27.319 --> 57:29.029
I believe a good cigar

57:27.319 --> 57:29.029
and glass of wine

57:29.071 --> 57:30.697
and a good conversation

57:30.739 --> 57:33.825
is as close to euphoria

57:30.739 --> 57:33.825
as one can get.

57:33.867 --> 57:35.660
In a legal sense.

They're going to my head.

57:42.584 --> 57:44.295
You're smoking a little fast.
