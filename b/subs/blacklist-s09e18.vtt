00:02.794 --> 00:04.254
[Marvin over phone] <i>Come on, Raymond.</i>

00:04.337 --> 00:06.047
<i>You really think Kate Kaplan is alive?</i>

00:06.131 --> 00:07.340
I don't know, Marvin.

00:07.424 --> 00:10.135
I never had divers recover her body.

00:10.218 --> 00:12.595
She chose the Potomac
as her final resting place

00:12.679 --> 00:14.347
and I chose to respect her wishes.

00:14.973 --> 00:16.850
I loved you, Raymond.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.019
Kate!

00:27.527 --> 00:29.738
<i>So it's possible she survived.</i>

00:29.821 --> 00:31.865
And what? Surfaced downriver?

00:31.948 --> 00:34.617
And somehow got help without us knowing

00:34.701 --> 00:39.330
and waited years for just the right moment
to exact her revenge?

00:39.414 --> 00:42.584
I'll tell you this, Marvin.
Kate loved Elizabeth.

00:42.667 --> 00:43.877
She helped to raise her.

00:43.960 --> 00:48.006
There is not a chance
she sent Vandyke to kill her.

00:48.089 --> 00:50.300
<i>So maybe she sent him to kill you.</i>

00:50.383 --> 00:51.217
Maybe.

00:51.301 --> 00:53.553
She didn't know about Townsend's wish

00:53.636 --> 00:55.722
for me to watch Elizabeth die.

00:55.805 --> 00:59.601
So she couldn't have known
Vandyke would kill Elizabeth first.

00:59.684 --> 01:02.771
<i>If it's Kate, we'll find her.</i>
<i>She's good, but we're better.</i>

01:02.854 --> 01:04.606
I'm not in D.C. I'm--

01:05.106 --> 01:06.524
God knows where I am.

01:06.608 --> 01:09.235
Weecha and I are
on our way to West Virginia.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.071
<i>Maureen Rowan lives there.</i>

01:11.154 --> 01:13.865
[Marvin] <i>Kate's sister?</i>
<i>I thought she was in witness protection.</i>

01:13.948 --> 01:14.783
[Raymond] <i>She is.</i>

01:14.866 --> 01:18.703
<i>Living under an alias</i>
<i>in a little town called Silverglade.</i>

01:18.787 --> 01:23.083
<i>If Kate's been alive all these years,</i>
<i>it's possible Maureen would know.</i>

01:23.166 --> 01:24.000
[Maureen] Raymond.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.126
Maureen.

01:25.627 --> 01:26.586
I should've called.

01:26.669 --> 01:28.213
You should have.

01:28.296 --> 01:29.714
But I wouldn't have answered.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.633
Mostly because I don't have a phone.

01:31.716 --> 01:34.010
[chuckles] What a lovely place.

01:34.093 --> 01:35.470
You've done all this yourself?

01:35.553 --> 01:37.889
I'm designing my own retirement plan.

01:37.972 --> 01:41.184
One day I'm gonna build
a gazebo out here and just sit.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.061
Why wait? Should do it now.

01:43.144 --> 01:45.522
Hmm, right now,
it's a little out of my price range.

01:45.605 --> 01:46.606
Someday.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.692
Oh, it's been awhile, Raymond.

01:49.776 --> 01:53.655
Last time we saw each other, you came
to tell me my sister had passed.

01:53.738 --> 01:54.572
[Raymond] Yes.

01:55.490 --> 01:59.619
I wish I could've told you more
about the circumstances.

01:59.702 --> 02:00.745
I don't.

02:00.829 --> 02:03.081
Kate and I never spoke about her work.

02:03.164 --> 02:06.543
But I always thought it was kind of you
to let me know she was gone.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.169
[Raymond] That's why I've come.

02:08.253 --> 02:12.715
I can't be certain, but it's possible
my condolences were premature.

02:15.301 --> 02:18.179
[Maureen]
I never asked about how Kate died.

02:18.263 --> 02:21.391
I assumed you made arrangements
for her remains.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.562
No. Her body was never recovered.

02:26.688 --> 02:27.689
I see.

02:29.023 --> 02:33.069
And this associate of yours,
the one who claims he saw her,

02:33.153 --> 02:33.987
you believe him?

02:34.070 --> 02:35.989
I believe he thinks he saw her.

02:36.614 --> 02:39.576
But that may be
what someone wanted him to think.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.872
You do remind me of her.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.708
Of better times.

02:47.959 --> 02:51.880
If Kate is alive,
she's been in hiding for a while.

02:51.963 --> 02:54.674
And it's likely
that she's in some trouble.

02:54.757 --> 02:57.051
If you've had any contact--

02:57.135 --> 02:58.636
I don't understand.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.890
Wouldn't you be the first person
she'd reach out to?

03:01.973 --> 03:03.349
So you haven't heard from her?

03:03.433 --> 03:04.559
That's no surprise.

03:04.642 --> 03:06.144
Kate and I were close in our way.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.605
But she would never come to me for help.

03:11.357 --> 03:12.358
What about the woman?

03:12.442 --> 03:16.946
You know, the one Kate was seeing
around the time she supposedly died?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.448
Kate was seeing someone?

03:18.531 --> 03:21.659
I only know because you weren't
the only visitor then.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.745
A woman came to meet me

03:23.828 --> 03:25.997
and to pay her respects.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.248
Clara.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.000
Clara Moore was her name.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.335
She worked with Kate.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.337
Said Kate taught her everything.

03:32.420 --> 03:33.755
Like a mentor.

03:33.838 --> 03:36.341
It was clear they'd been in a relationship

03:36.424 --> 03:39.052
and she loved my sister very much.

03:39.135 --> 03:40.929
If you could find her,

03:41.012 --> 03:42.513
she might know something.

03:42.597 --> 03:43.890
Clara Moore.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.727
That's very helpful.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.781
I've been waiting for this day
for a long time.

03:59.864 --> 04:01.199
Psilocybin.

04:01.282 --> 04:02.450
Ketamine.

04:02.533 --> 04:04.035
LSD.

04:04.118 --> 04:05.662
MDMA.

04:05.745 --> 04:06.788
For the first time,

04:06.871 --> 04:10.375
mainstream medical institutions
are taking a long, hard look

04:10.458 --> 04:13.378
at the healthcare benefits
of psychedelics.

04:13.461 --> 04:16.756
Major universities in this country
and around the world

04:16.839 --> 04:20.301
are studying these drugs
and how they can help patients.

04:22.345 --> 04:23.263
[knocks]

04:23.972 --> 04:27.850
-You can just leave it, thanks.
-No can do. I need a signature.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.229
[lock buzzes]

04:31.312 --> 04:32.772
[Avery] <i>This is our moment.</i>

04:32.855 --> 04:33.940
<i>As we speak,</i>

04:34.023 --> 04:38.152
<i>venture capitalists are spending</i>
<i>billions of legitimate dollars...</i>

04:41.406 --> 04:44.784
<i>on companies that make</i>
<i>and sell mind-altering drugs.</i>

04:44.867 --> 04:46.160
<i>I want our share.</i>

04:46.703 --> 04:49.372
<i>Hell, I want more than our share.</i>

04:52.834 --> 04:54.085
Stay.

04:58.089 --> 05:01.634
We are the future of healthcare.

05:01.718 --> 05:05.263
And you're gonna look back on today and
tell your grandchildren you were there.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.278
[Laszlo] I warned you.

05:25.241 --> 05:29.120
Did you really think
I'd let you set up shop in my city?

05:29.203 --> 05:30.872
[man] Oroszlan. There's no time.

05:42.216 --> 05:44.677
I'm always glad to see you, Raymond.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.220
But I have to admit,

05:46.304 --> 05:49.265
I was hoping you'd give
this next new case to Aram.

05:49.348 --> 05:51.434
He's in charge of the Task Force.

05:51.517 --> 05:54.103
Have you thought any more
about giving him another chance?

05:54.187 --> 05:55.563
I have. Sorry, Harold.

05:55.646 --> 05:57.607
I just don't trust him.

05:57.690 --> 05:58.900
He's simply...

06:00.276 --> 06:01.903
wound too tight.

06:01.986 --> 06:03.237
Maybe.

06:03.321 --> 06:07.158
When I left the office last night, he was
agonizing over this year's annual review.

06:07.241 --> 06:10.953
He has to fill out a report
on all the agents under his command.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.914
I must say,
it's got him pretty stressed out.

06:12.997 --> 06:13.915
Hmm.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.501
I wonder if he'd consider therapy.

06:16.584 --> 06:21.464
Specifically guided therapy
aided by psychedelics.

06:21.547 --> 06:26.177
Properly applied,
I find LSD to be helpful in dark times.

06:26.260 --> 06:27.929
And a blast in good times.

06:28.012 --> 06:31.933
Nothing loosens a tight sphincter
like a good eight-hour acid trip.

06:32.016 --> 06:32.934
LSD is illegal.

06:33.017 --> 06:35.394
Well, it doesn't have to be LSD.

06:35.478 --> 06:36.395
Ketamine.

06:36.479 --> 06:37.647
Psilocybin.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.858
The point is
there's new interest in these drugs.

06:40.942 --> 06:46.447
It's been almost 60 years since
Harvard University fired Timothy Leary.

06:46.531 --> 06:49.242
Now even Harvard's studying
the health benefits

06:49.325 --> 06:51.702
of the drugs he so famously touted.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.287
-That's good news.
-It is.

06:53.371 --> 06:57.416
For everyone except the criminals
who make a living selling them.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.253
Criminals like Laszlo Jankowics.

07:00.336 --> 07:01.504
Jankowics.

07:01.587 --> 07:02.839
Why do I know that name?

07:02.922 --> 07:05.258
Because his father Marko
was once on the Blacklist.

07:05.341 --> 07:08.970
He used to be one of the world's
biggest LSD distributors.

07:09.053 --> 07:11.055
-Until Ressler killed him.
-Yes.

07:11.139 --> 07:13.182
But as dangerous as Marko was,

07:13.266 --> 07:17.270
I'm afraid his son Laszlo
is even more unhinged.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.564
[Park] This morning, six homicides.

07:19.647 --> 07:22.984
Reddington thinks that this Laszlo
just gunned them down in their chairs?

07:23.067 --> 07:25.945
It's nine, actually, including
the guards and receptionist.

07:26.028 --> 07:28.698
This happened because
he didn't want a legitimate company

07:28.781 --> 07:29.991
making these drugs legally?

07:30.074 --> 07:31.367
[Dembe] Could that be the motive?

07:31.451 --> 07:33.995
Who in their right mind
would kill nine people for that?

07:34.078 --> 07:36.706
That's the thing.
He's not in his right mind.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.876
Laszlo's known for being addicted
to his own product.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.335
<i>A liquid form of LSD.</i>

07:41.419 --> 07:44.672
<i>And when abused, LSD can do</i>
<i>some pretty serious damage to the brain.</i>

07:44.755 --> 07:47.383
In some cases,
your hallucinations can become permanent.

07:47.467 --> 07:51.429
Reddington says they call him "Oroszlan."
Hungarian word for "lion."

07:51.512 --> 07:53.556
Because he thinks
he's the king of the jungle?

07:53.639 --> 07:56.809
No, because he thinks a fully-grown
African lion goes wherever he goes.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.189
We're running low on product.
We need to make new arrangements.

08:01.272 --> 08:02.398
I already have.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.817
The Phan organization has sent a shipment.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.360
It's arriving at the port today.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.488
Today? The port is not safe.

08:08.571 --> 08:12.116
-Why would you take an unnecessary risk?
-It is necessary.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.786
We need product to stay in business.

08:20.291 --> 08:23.419
[Aram] <i>So Laszlo Jankowics</i>
<i>is the next name on the Blacklist?</i>

08:23.503 --> 08:25.213
Correct. Who Red wants us to find.

08:25.296 --> 08:28.508
Why? We're looking for whoever
orchestrated Liz's death,

08:28.591 --> 08:31.928
the same person blackmailing you.
What's the connection to this Oroszlan?

08:32.011 --> 08:32.845
I don't know.

08:32.929 --> 08:36.307
-Reddington just said it was important.
-To us? Or to him?

08:37.016 --> 08:38.226
Agent Ressler.

08:38.309 --> 08:41.771
Look, I know it's weird
that I'm the boss or whatever,

08:41.854 --> 08:43.731
but let me know if you're gonna be late.

08:43.814 --> 08:45.233
[Cooper] That was my fault.

08:45.316 --> 08:48.611
Ressler and I have been investigating
Reggie Cole and Tyson Lacroix.

08:48.694 --> 08:52.365
I asked him to apply for a warrant
to search Lacroix's home.

08:52.448 --> 08:54.867
That request was approved 20 minutes ago.

08:54.951 --> 08:55.952
Good news.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.370
Aram, if it's okay,

08:57.453 --> 08:59.664
we would like to execute the warrant.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.916
Yeah. I mean, yes, that's perfect.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.417
Agent Park, Agent Zuma,

09:03.501 --> 09:06.170
we have an active crime scene
at Virtual Horizons Lab.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.922
Why don't you head there?

09:08.673 --> 09:09.966
Good. Yeah.

09:11.133 --> 09:12.134
Don't worry about me.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.929
I'm just gonna be filling out
a thousand pages

09:15.012 --> 09:16.847
judging you all for the Bureau.

09:17.473 --> 09:18.432
Best job ever.

09:25.064 --> 09:28.025
Mr. Avery, thank you for speaking with me,
I know how difficult--

09:28.109 --> 09:29.694
I have to tell their families.

09:29.777 --> 09:33.406
These people, my staff,
they had wives, husbands, children.

09:33.489 --> 09:34.949
[Dembe] The Bureau can help.

09:35.032 --> 09:38.452
I'd like to focus on the meeting
you had this morning.

09:38.536 --> 09:42.832
We just started. Today was our first day
in our brand-new lab.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.417
[Dembe] You're a chemist, right?

09:44.500 --> 09:46.294
I have a degree in neurochemistry, yes.

09:46.377 --> 09:49.171
But I consider myself a medical futurist.

09:49.255 --> 09:52.675
My work is about advancing healthcare,
improving lives.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.510
By manufacturing psychedelic drugs?

09:54.594 --> 09:56.012
By studying them.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.848
And yes, maybe one day selling them.

09:58.931 --> 10:02.893
Problem is some people already sell them,
and they don't want any competition.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.353
That why this happened?

10:04.437 --> 10:08.733
The Bureau is aware of an organization
that sells illegal psychedelics.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.610
We think they were sending a message.

10:10.693 --> 10:13.029
By murdering my entire staff?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.573
How many gunmen were there?

10:16.365 --> 10:18.409
I don't know.

10:19.660 --> 10:20.995
Mr. Avery.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.705
You were the only survivor.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.291
I'm sure you're scared
but if there's anything you saw--

10:25.374 --> 10:27.251
No, I wish I had.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.754
When I heard the shots, I immediately ran.

10:29.837 --> 10:33.049
I was hiding in that room
so I never saw their faces.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.843
Agent Zuma. Sorry to interrupt.
You should see this.

10:36.927 --> 10:38.095
Excuse me.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.058
We caught a break.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.353
You're looking at acrylic plexiglass.
Over 3.5 inches thick.

10:45.436 --> 10:48.564
Installed to weather
an accidental chemical explosion.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.067
Today it functioned as bulletproof glass.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.110
The slug never fragmented.

10:53.194 --> 10:57.031
[Dembe] Great. Let's pull it and
run it for ballistics and latent prints.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.620
I don't understand.
Why is any of this necessary?

11:02.703 --> 11:05.539
Mrs. Lacroix, you've seen the warrant.
Let us do our jobs.

11:05.623 --> 11:06.874
Your jobs?

11:06.957 --> 11:08.376
My husband was murdered.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.670
It's your job to find his killer.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.213
That's what we're trying to do.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.131
By seizing my husband's files?

11:14.215 --> 11:15.174
He's the victim.

11:15.257 --> 11:16.801
You're acting like he was a criminal.

11:16.884 --> 11:19.887
I'm sorry, but we're here because Tyson,
whether he knew it or not,

11:19.970 --> 11:22.306
was connected to a criminal conspiracy.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.641
What kind of--?

11:23.724 --> 11:26.602
I can't discuss our evidence.
With one exception.

11:27.686 --> 11:28.521
This man.

11:28.604 --> 11:29.563
Ever seen him?

11:29.647 --> 11:31.273
His name was Reginald Cole.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.566
I don't know who that is.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.693
I knew my husband. You're wrong.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.362
He was a good man.

11:36.445 --> 11:37.446
An honest lawyer.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.614
[Cooper] We're almost done.

11:38.697 --> 11:40.449
We'll be out within the hour.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.743
Check this out.

11:42.827 --> 11:46.664
Lacroix and Cole weren't just lawyer
and client, they were working together.

11:46.747 --> 11:47.748
Makes sense.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.960
Not unusual for a civil attorney
to have a private eye on the payroll.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.212
What's unusual
is what Cole was hired to do.

11:53.295 --> 11:56.132
He was keeping around-the-clock
surveillance on Stanford March.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.425
[Cooper] The tech executive?

11:57.508 --> 11:59.176
[Ressler] Sent Lacroix a full dossier.

11:59.260 --> 12:02.721
Photos, itinerary,
a detailed list of his known assets.

12:03.305 --> 12:05.891
-What are you thinking?
-Where's the case?

12:05.975 --> 12:08.394
Lacroix never filed a suit against March.

12:08.477 --> 12:10.896
-Maybe he didn't get the chance.
-Maybe.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.857
Maybe that was never the plan.

12:12.940 --> 12:14.650
If Cole was blackmailing you,

12:14.733 --> 12:17.111
what if he was doing the same to others?

12:17.194 --> 12:19.822
Let's go see if Mr. March
can enlighten us.

12:24.493 --> 12:28.330
Good news. Got a latent print off a slug
recovered at Virtual Horizons Lab.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.500
Print comes back to a three-time felon
named Sebastian Graham.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.544
What's he doing out where he can kill?

12:33.627 --> 12:36.922
He's on parole for a weapons charge.
Felon in possession of a firearm.

12:37.006 --> 12:40.134
We talked to his parole officer.
She's calling him in.

12:40.217 --> 12:44.263
-When he shows, we'll bring him in.
-Sounds good. Keep me posted.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.438
Hey. I need a sec.

12:53.022 --> 12:53.939
What's up?

12:54.023 --> 12:56.692
That's the annual review paperwork, right?

12:58.194 --> 12:59.320
Unfortunately.

12:59.403 --> 13:00.738
You do mine yet?

13:00.821 --> 13:03.866
If you haven't, I was hoping
to talk to you first.

13:03.949 --> 13:07.703
Give you an update about my condition
before you report to Main Justice.

13:07.786 --> 13:11.499
Yeah. I was kind of gearing up
to ask you about your headaches.

13:11.582 --> 13:12.625
They're so much better.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.544
You may not really
even have to mention them.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.296
If they're still happening--

13:17.379 --> 13:18.506
They're not. Not really.

13:18.589 --> 13:21.383
Once in a great while
but nothing like before.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.135
Now something needs to trigger them,

13:23.219 --> 13:26.347
like an extremely bright light
or a super-loud noise.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.724
-Alina.
-I'm not asking you not to mention them.

13:28.807 --> 13:30.476
That would be improper.

13:30.559 --> 13:32.686
But if you didn't feel the need to--

13:33.896 --> 13:38.025
Look. I love this job. You know how much
I love being in the field.

13:38.108 --> 13:42.738
I'm afraid if they see it, they'll
sit me down and I can't handle that.

13:43.906 --> 13:44.740
Right.

13:44.823 --> 13:45.741
So...

13:46.909 --> 13:48.327
we're good then?

13:49.620 --> 13:52.498
I'm not sure I can leave it out entirely.

13:52.581 --> 13:55.501
But I guess I need to think about it.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.295
But I will...

13:59.046 --> 14:00.047
think about it.

14:00.548 --> 14:01.382
Thanks.

14:05.094 --> 14:05.970
[door closes]

14:06.595 --> 14:08.222
[hammering]

14:10.182 --> 14:12.184
[machinery whirring]

14:13.477 --> 14:15.813
Oh, Raymond. You didn't have to.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.900
I often do what I have to, Maureen.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.361
But this I did because I wanted to.

14:22.444 --> 14:25.281
The instant you told me about the gazebo,

14:25.364 --> 14:27.533
I knew I'd be back to see it happen.

14:27.616 --> 14:29.326
Is it a thank-you?

14:29.410 --> 14:32.454
Does that mean you found Clara Moore,
the woman I told you about?

14:32.538 --> 14:35.583
Not yet, but I have
some of my sharpest associates

14:35.666 --> 14:37.209
working on it as we speak.

14:37.293 --> 14:42.339
And I thought while I wait, we could spend
a little more time together.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.592
I really do remind you of her, don't I?

14:44.675 --> 14:45.551
Yes.

14:45.634 --> 14:47.928
We really are different, you know?

14:48.012 --> 14:49.722
It's ironic, don't you think?

14:49.805 --> 14:52.600
That I gave up a normal life
to catch a criminal

14:52.683 --> 14:55.352
and Kate gave up
a normal life to become one.

14:55.436 --> 15:00.316
I've never asked you about your decision
to testify against Alexei Lagunov.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.067
Do you regret it?

15:02.151 --> 15:04.695
I asked Kate for advice.

15:04.778 --> 15:07.489
When I saw those men
moving that man's body,

15:07.573 --> 15:09.283
I asked her what I should do.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.368
And she said, "Do nothing."

15:11.452 --> 15:13.537
Not because she was afraid for me

15:13.621 --> 15:17.333
but because she really
didn't believe it was any of my business.

15:17.416 --> 15:21.754
I remember hanging up the phone
knowing I was going to call the police.

15:21.837 --> 15:22.755
Why?

15:23.631 --> 15:26.050
Probably because she told me not to.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.760
I didn't answer your question.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.553
Do I regret it?

15:30.054 --> 15:32.389
I did for a long time.

15:32.473 --> 15:35.601
Kate wasn't the only one
with dreams of a bigger life.

15:35.684 --> 15:36.810
Excitement.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.437
I wanted to travel.

15:38.520 --> 15:41.649
Told my mother
I'd become the youngest curator

15:41.732 --> 15:44.526
in the history of the Metropolitan Museum.

15:46.737 --> 15:49.865
All of that changed when I took the stand.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.202
But I've come to enjoy the quiet.

15:53.285 --> 15:56.163
I work part-time at a book store in town.

15:56.246 --> 15:59.249
I'm on the board
of the Silverglade public library.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.168
I have my garden.

16:01.752 --> 16:05.089
I think I've redefined
what I consider excitement.

16:05.172 --> 16:08.217
This life has been plenty big for me.

16:08.884 --> 16:10.135
And I'm content.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.181
[door opens]

16:14.932 --> 16:16.642
Wanna tell me what this is about?

16:16.725 --> 16:18.018
I need to get home.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.604
I think you know what this is about.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.398
You left a print at Virtual Horizons.

16:22.481 --> 16:23.357
I read your sheet.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.276
Plenty of warning signs,
but nine homicides?

16:26.360 --> 16:29.071
-Next level.
-How do I know this is real?

16:29.154 --> 16:31.657
You'll know when the judge admits it
at your trial.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.993
We know you work for Laszlo Jankowics.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.412
-I don't know who that is.
-You call him Oroszlan.

16:36.495 --> 16:37.997
Where can we find him?

16:38.497 --> 16:40.624
Where can you find a Hungarian lion?

16:41.500 --> 16:42.751
Try the Budapest Zoo.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.586
You're going to prison.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.296
There's no need to protect him now.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.506
Protect him?

16:48.757 --> 16:49.842
Look.

16:50.551 --> 16:51.927
I don't know the man...

16:52.428 --> 16:54.013
but I know his reputation.

16:54.638 --> 16:56.098
You wanna talk about next level?

16:56.181 --> 17:00.185
I hear he's done so much acid
his brain is permanently damaged.

17:00.269 --> 17:03.689
He'd order your death and forget about it
the second he said the words.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.775
Oroszlan's the reason you're here.

17:06.859 --> 17:10.863
Unless it was your idea to shoot up
a room full of innocent people.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.075
They weren't all innocent.

17:15.993 --> 17:16.952
What does that mean?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.954
[Graham] If you know about Oroszlan,

17:19.038 --> 17:22.541
then you know he inherited
his organization from his father.

17:22.624 --> 17:25.210
Sarkany built an empire
but he didn't do it alone.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.837
He had a partner.

17:26.920 --> 17:31.258
A chemist who knew how to turn
the ingredients Sarkany got into product.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.845
Wallace Avery.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.014
He tried walking away.

17:37.097 --> 17:39.183
All this talk
about people spending billions

17:39.266 --> 17:41.727
to develop the same drugs
he'd been making for years?

17:42.728 --> 17:44.521
He cut Oroszlan out.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.566
Figured he had the experience
and degrees to go legit.

17:47.649 --> 17:49.443
I won't help you get Oroszlan.

17:50.944 --> 17:52.988
Wallace Avery can go to hell.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.491
[cell phone ringing]

17:55.991 --> 17:56.825
Dembe.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.452
Haven't found Jankowics.

17:58.535 --> 18:02.498
But the key to that may be
a chemist named Wallace Avery.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.666
<i>Jankowics targeted Virtual Horizons</i>

18:04.750 --> 18:06.877
because Avery used to work for him,

18:06.960 --> 18:08.545
then he made a play on his own.

18:08.629 --> 18:09.630
[Raymond] <i>How can I help?</i>

18:09.713 --> 18:12.883
[Dembe]<i> We sent units to his address</i>
<i>but he already cleared out.</i>

18:12.966 --> 18:15.469
<i>He knows Laszlo won't stop looking</i>
<i>until he's dead,</i>

18:15.552 --> 18:17.179
<i>so he's probably in hiding.</i>

18:17.262 --> 18:20.516
I was thinking
maybe Rogelio could find him.

18:20.599 --> 18:23.519
Send me the details
and I'll reach out right away.

18:24.895 --> 18:26.021
[cell phone ringing]

18:27.856 --> 18:28.774
You're insane.

18:28.857 --> 18:31.652
Huh. And you're a dead man walking.

18:31.735 --> 18:34.321
<i>My people say you've cleared out</i>
<i>of your apartment.</i>

18:34.404 --> 18:36.990
What do you think my dad
would've done to you, Wallace?

18:37.991 --> 18:41.078
What would he want me to do?

18:42.037 --> 18:44.456
[cackling]

18:51.630 --> 18:53.632
[Raymond] He owns a laundry business,

18:53.715 --> 18:55.926
but in reality, he's the architect

18:56.009 --> 18:59.680
of one of the best intelligence networks
in existence.

18:59.763 --> 19:03.267
An army of bellhops, busboys,

19:03.350 --> 19:05.894
waiters, waitresses, housekeepers.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.314
Rogelio took people who often go unseen

19:09.398 --> 19:13.944
and fused them
into one great all-seeing eye.

19:14.027 --> 19:15.696
Rogelio!

19:15.779 --> 19:17.447
Thank you for coming.

19:17.531 --> 19:20.617
<i>Amigo,</i> I have to hurry.
I told you, I have an appointment.

19:20.701 --> 19:21.535
Yes.

19:21.618 --> 19:23.579
But perhaps you could reschedule.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.038
Something's come up.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.248
Reschedule? No.

19:26.331 --> 19:27.166
Impossible.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.210
I didn't tell you
but I applied for my citizenship.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.921
After 20 years of living in this country,

19:33.005 --> 19:35.132
I'm finally gonna be
a naturalized American.

19:35.215 --> 19:36.049
My word.

19:36.133 --> 19:39.094
My civics interview's in two hours.
Waited over a year for a time.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.890
I'm studying 120 questions
on American history and government.

19:42.973 --> 19:46.059
And how many questions
will they actually ask you?

19:46.143 --> 19:48.103
Only 20, but I won't know which ones.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.022
I have to get 12 right to pass.

19:50.105 --> 19:51.648
I see.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.443
I've never been much
for pledges of allegiance,

19:54.526 --> 19:57.529
particularly when it comes to governments.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.865
But I respect and honor your decision.

19:59.948 --> 20:01.909
-Two hours, you said?
-Until the test.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.535
I'm going to my sister's to study.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.705
I'll tell you what.
There's a man I need you to find.

20:06.788 --> 20:08.874
We think he's holed up here in D.C.

20:08.957 --> 20:10.751
-I can't--
-Hear me out.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.127
I'll give you the details,

20:12.211 --> 20:14.171
you reach out to your network.

20:14.254 --> 20:17.299
And while we wait, I'll help you study.

20:18.508 --> 20:20.385
Mr. March, thanks for taking the time.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.930
Your assistant made it clear
your agenda was full.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.891
And you made it clear you didn't care.
Here I am.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.351
How can I help the FBI?

20:27.434 --> 20:29.311
We're investigating two suspects.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.855
Two recent murder victims
we think you may be aware of.

20:31.939 --> 20:32.898
I'm confused.

20:32.981 --> 20:35.067
-Were they suspects or victims?
-Both.

20:35.150 --> 20:39.029
An attorney named Tyson Lacroix
and a private eye named Reginald Cole.

20:39.112 --> 20:40.864
Lacroix and Cole are dead?

20:40.948 --> 20:43.200
-[Cooper] So you knew them.
-We'll cut right to it.

20:43.283 --> 20:45.869
We have evidence Reggie Cole
was engaged in blackmail.

20:45.953 --> 20:49.289
We think that Tyson Lacroix
may also have been involved.

20:49.373 --> 20:52.918
Your name came up as someone
they may have been targeting.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.213
I always thought blackmail meant

20:56.296 --> 21:00.425
paying someone to stop them
from revealing something you did.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.219
This was more like extortion.

21:03.720 --> 21:04.930
Had some trouble recently.

21:05.013 --> 21:08.725
A woman who worked as a nanny
for my son made some accusations.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.519
What type of accusations?

21:10.602 --> 21:11.520
Sexual assault.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.856
Look, I have no interest
in rehashing her claims.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.025
She went to the police, filed a complaint.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.069
No charges were ever filed.

21:19.152 --> 21:22.447
I thought that was the end of it until
Lacroix showed up with his investigator

21:22.531 --> 21:24.074
and said he represented the woman.

21:24.157 --> 21:25.117
He wanted money?

21:25.200 --> 21:27.744
-Or else he'd file a lawsuit?
-[March] That's right.

21:27.828 --> 21:31.164
And as you know, burden in a civil trial,
a lot lower than a criminal one.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.875
-You reach a settlement?
-A confidential one.

21:33.959 --> 21:37.421
A million-five.
Which I only paid to spare my family.

21:37.504 --> 21:38.338
Look.

21:40.048 --> 21:42.259
You look like you know your business.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.344
I'm sure you don't need my advice.

21:44.428 --> 21:45.429
We're listening.

21:45.512 --> 21:47.014
I'm not a detective.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.473
But in my business,

21:48.557 --> 21:51.852
most mysteries get solved
if I do one key thing.

21:51.935 --> 21:53.312
And what's that?

21:53.395 --> 21:54.396
Follow the money.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.108
[Raymond] Okay, concentrate.
I'm picking up the pace.

21:58.191 --> 22:01.320
What founding document
was written in 1787?

22:01.403 --> 22:02.738
The U.S. Constitution.

22:02.821 --> 22:05.282
How many Amendments
does the Constitution have?

22:05.365 --> 22:06.199
Twenty...

22:06.908 --> 22:07.743
seven?

22:07.826 --> 22:09.161
Are you asking me?

22:09.244 --> 22:11.288
-Twenty-seven. Final answer.
-[chuckles]

22:11.371 --> 22:13.749
The first 10 Amendments are known as--?

22:13.832 --> 22:15.792
-The Bill of Rights.
-You're crushing this.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.712
Take a break, have some water,
check the network.

22:19.421 --> 22:20.380
Nothing yet.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.507
But we'll find him. One hour left.
Keep going!

22:22.591 --> 22:25.302
Name the three branches of government.

22:25.385 --> 22:27.304
Executive, judicial...

22:28.263 --> 22:30.182
-We just went over this.
-I know.

22:30.265 --> 22:31.224
They write the laws.

22:31.308 --> 22:34.436
-I know. People in the Congress--
-Okay, pass.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.520
We'll come back to it.

22:35.604 --> 22:38.523
Name one writer of the <i>Federalist Papers.</i>

22:39.941 --> 22:43.153
Big Lou just bought
a beach house in Margate because--?

22:43.236 --> 22:46.406
Because he made a boatload of cash
scalping tickets to <i>Hamilton.</i>

22:46.490 --> 22:47.783
-Boom!
-Hamilton!

22:48.950 --> 22:52.079
Why is it important to pay federal taxes?

22:52.162 --> 22:53.622
Ugh. Don't answer that.

22:53.705 --> 22:55.749
-I'm getting a little car sick.
-[cell phone beeps]

22:55.832 --> 22:57.959
Ooh. I told you. We found him.

22:58.043 --> 23:02.214
Your boy Wallace Avery's
in a motel by the airport.

23:02.297 --> 23:05.675
-Clarissa just brought him towels.
-Clarissa just made ten grand.

23:06.259 --> 23:08.220
I'll write down the address for you.

23:08.720 --> 23:09.971
[Rogelio clears throat]

23:12.265 --> 23:15.060
I can't thank you enough, Rogelio.

23:15.143 --> 23:16.436
Good luck today.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.521
<i>Gracias.</i>

23:18.230 --> 23:19.147
Ah.

23:19.231 --> 23:23.235
-Legislative. That was the third branch.
-[chuckles] You see? You've got this.

23:23.318 --> 23:25.070
Let me know how it goes.

23:26.780 --> 23:27.864
[door closes]

23:28.907 --> 23:32.452
So, what now, you tell
the Task Force where to find Avery?

23:32.536 --> 23:35.080
Actually, I have another idea in mind.

23:43.547 --> 23:46.758
-Any sign of Oroszlan?
-Who are you?

23:46.842 --> 23:48.343
What are you doing here?

23:49.511 --> 23:51.930
You're a very popular fellow, Wallace.

23:52.013 --> 23:54.432
Laszlo Jankowics is looking for you.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.977
Unfortunately, the FBI is too.

23:57.060 --> 23:59.646
They know you used to work together.

23:59.729 --> 24:02.232
Oroszlan sent you to kill me?

24:02.315 --> 24:03.984
[Raymond] No, no. Nothing like that.

24:04.067 --> 24:07.904
In fact, I'd rather not get involved
in the little dispute.

24:07.988 --> 24:12.284
But I do need to find someone.
A woman you may know named Clara Moore.

24:13.743 --> 24:15.787
-You're looking for Clara?
-You do know her.

24:15.871 --> 24:18.498
My sources tell me she works for Laszlo.

24:18.582 --> 24:21.042
But we're having a devil
of a time trying to find her.

24:21.126 --> 24:24.129
You won't. Only Oroszlan
knows how to reach Clara.

24:24.212 --> 24:29.134
-And why is that?
-He's psychotic and paranoid.

24:29.217 --> 24:31.928
And she knows where all
the bodies are buried.

24:32.012 --> 24:33.763
Ah. I see.

24:34.806 --> 24:36.224
That changes things.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.518
I'm sorry, Wallace,

24:38.602 --> 24:41.688
but I'll have to involve myself
in your dispute.

24:41.771 --> 24:42.814
What do you mean?

24:42.898 --> 24:45.859
If Laszlo is the only one
who knows how to reach Clara Moore,

24:45.942 --> 24:48.695
I'll have to give him
a reason to do just that.

24:55.076 --> 24:58.872
-What if Laszlo didn't get the message?
-Patience, Weecha.

25:00.373 --> 25:01.666
[knocking on door]

25:09.966 --> 25:11.176
Just him.

25:19.643 --> 25:20.602
Oh, oh.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.062
Stay.

25:33.323 --> 25:36.368
Raymond Reddington.
I always hoped we'd meet.

25:36.451 --> 25:39.162
Oroszlan. We did meet.

25:39.246 --> 25:43.583
I was introduced to your father once,
on a yacht in Monte Carlo years ago.

25:43.667 --> 25:47.879
You were with him. You don't remember.
You were just a boy at the time.

25:47.963 --> 25:49.839
[Laszlo] I was surprised to get your call.

25:49.923 --> 25:52.550
Why would a man like you
want to do me a favor?

25:52.634 --> 25:54.511
[Raymond] No favors, just business.

25:54.594 --> 25:59.808
When I heard you were down a chemist,
it occurred to me you may be running low.

25:59.891 --> 26:01.518
-Am I right?
-[Laszlo] I made arrangements.

26:01.601 --> 26:04.813
The Phan cartel sent a shipment.
Should get into the port of D.C. today.

26:04.896 --> 26:08.441
Ah. Ask around.
Port security's a specialty of mine.

26:08.525 --> 26:13.655
In the future, I'd be willing to guarantee
safe transport, for the right price.

26:13.738 --> 26:16.116
Now I know why they call you
the Concierge of Crime.

26:16.199 --> 26:18.702
Do they? Well, I'm a problem solver.

26:18.785 --> 26:20.078
Like Wallace here.

26:20.161 --> 26:22.747
Your people have been looking for him.

26:22.831 --> 26:23.873
Well, here he is.

26:23.957 --> 26:27.460
A good faith gesture to get
our dealings off on the right foot.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.546
Oroszlan, please. You can't--

26:29.629 --> 26:31.798
-[Raymond] Quiet.
-He kills people, my staff.

26:31.881 --> 26:34.009
-Quiet.
-You can't hand me over.

26:34.092 --> 26:35.385
He'll just kill--

26:40.432 --> 26:41.683
[Ressler] Hey.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.852
You're not gonna believe this.

26:43.935 --> 26:47.480
I got off the phone with Susan Powell,
the woman who accused March of assault.

26:47.564 --> 26:50.483
She's never heard
of Tyson Lacroix or Reginald Cole.

26:50.567 --> 26:52.569
-Say that again?
-Lacroix wasn't her lawyer.

26:52.652 --> 26:54.738
He went to March claiming
to represent her.

26:54.821 --> 26:58.658
He negotiated for a million
and a half, they've never even met.

26:58.742 --> 27:02.203
-So it's just a scam?
-Just a scam?

27:02.287 --> 27:05.457
This is brilliant.
I mean, Cole found the cases.

27:05.540 --> 27:08.543
Complaints made by victims that
didn't result in criminal charges.

27:08.626 --> 27:13.882
All Lacroix had to do was claim to
represent the victims and negotiate deals.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.592
-It's meaningless.
-It's inspired.

27:15.675 --> 27:17.761
-I don't know how I never--
-Donald.

27:17.844 --> 27:21.598
I get that you appreciate the ingenuity,
but how does this keep me out of prison?

27:21.681 --> 27:23.058
Panabaker was clear.

27:23.141 --> 27:27.062
My best chance to avoid prosecution
is to give Main Justice something big.

27:27.145 --> 27:30.774
The truth behind Elizabeth's death
and my blackmail.

27:30.857 --> 27:33.193
-We're trying.
-But what if we're wasting our time?

27:33.276 --> 27:35.403
What if none of this is connected?

27:35.487 --> 27:38.365
-We can't think like that.
-I can't?

27:38.448 --> 27:40.450
-That's easy for you.
-No, Harold.

27:40.533 --> 27:42.660
It's not easy for any of us.

27:43.411 --> 27:45.121
I can't deal with this.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.749
-I have to clear my head.
-Where are you going?

27:47.832 --> 27:50.293
Home. To see my family while I still can.

27:54.714 --> 27:57.050
-You killed him.
-I thought you wanted him dead?

27:57.133 --> 27:58.635
Not here. Not now.

27:58.718 --> 28:01.679
He talked to the Feds.
I would've found out what he told them.

28:01.763 --> 28:04.974
Nothing, I'm sure.
The man's hiding out in an airport motel.

28:05.058 --> 28:07.811
If he talked,
he'd be locked in a safe house.

28:07.894 --> 28:10.313
He was my chemist.
You should've let me handle it.

28:10.397 --> 28:12.607
You're overthinking this. Go.

28:12.690 --> 28:15.485
I'll make a call,
have my cleaner here within the hour.

28:15.568 --> 28:16.403
Raymond.

28:16.486 --> 28:17.529
[whispering]

28:18.238 --> 28:21.533
What? Well, how was I to remember that?

28:21.616 --> 28:23.451
-What?
-[Raymond] There's no problem.

28:23.535 --> 28:27.330
Apparently, my best cleaner
is on a flight over the Atlantic.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.582
Went to take care
of something in Tel Aviv.

28:29.666 --> 28:31.042
Don't worry about it.

28:31.126 --> 28:36.464
I'll use a backup, although my next choice
is in New York, so a couple of hours.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.049
-A couple hours?
-I know.

28:38.133 --> 28:40.260
I wonder if they do turn down
service here?

28:40.343 --> 28:42.637
-I've got someone.
-[Raymond] No. Please, let me.

28:42.721 --> 28:43.972
You've done enough.

28:44.055 --> 28:46.015
I'm getting out
and you should do the same.

28:46.099 --> 28:48.059
-If that's what you want.
-Calling her now.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.853
I'll look for my shell casings.

28:49.936 --> 28:51.354
Guys, let's go.

28:58.069 --> 28:59.487
Well done, Wallace.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.367
-You think he bought it?
-[Raymond] I do.

29:04.451 --> 29:06.369
Which means you need
to leave town immediately.

29:06.453 --> 29:07.829
Weecha will arrange it.

29:07.912 --> 29:10.457
-[Avery] Where am I going?
-How about Acapulco?

29:10.540 --> 29:14.586
You could set up shop, send us
a sample or two from time to time.

29:14.669 --> 29:16.588
-Acapulco?
-[Raymond] Just a thought.

29:16.671 --> 29:19.424
Consider your death a new lease on life.

29:19.507 --> 29:20.717
-[cell phone ringing]
-Ah.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.677
Please excuse me.

29:25.096 --> 29:27.932
Dembe. Any luck
finding our little wack job?

29:28.016 --> 29:29.684
[Dembe] <i>None. That's why I'm calling.</i>

29:29.768 --> 29:32.312
I was hoping Rogelio
found his former chemist.

29:32.395 --> 29:35.106
Wallace Avery? In the wind, I'm sure.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.983
I do have another lead.

29:37.066 --> 29:40.612
I heard from a source that Laszlo's
expecting a shipment

29:40.695 --> 29:44.866
from the Phan cartel
to arrive today at the port in D.C.

29:44.949 --> 29:47.494
-How reliable?
<i>-Pretty good, I think.</i>

29:47.577 --> 29:49.788
If he's right
and if you're waiting at the port,

29:49.871 --> 29:52.916
perhaps you could grab Laszlo
along with the goods.

29:57.337 --> 29:58.463
[door unlocks]

30:01.633 --> 30:03.635
[Raymond] Clara Moore. Welcome.

30:03.718 --> 30:04.803
Please, come in.

30:08.139 --> 30:11.810
-Hey. You wanted to see me?
-Yeah. Hey, please. Come in.

30:14.771 --> 30:16.064
Look. Um...

30:17.190 --> 30:20.485
I have been doing a lot of thinking
and I have decided

30:20.568 --> 30:24.572
that it is not my place to say
anything about your headaches.

30:25.281 --> 30:27.575
Wow, thank you.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.786
Well, let me finish.

30:29.869 --> 30:34.791
See, the thing is, I haven't really been
feeling like myself lately.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.712
So it just feels wrong for me
to be evaluating you, all of you,

30:40.380 --> 30:43.508
when I have been going
through some struggles of my own.

30:44.300 --> 30:50.014
So I have decided that you should
fill out your own evaluation.

30:50.807 --> 30:52.517
-Are you serious?
-Very.

30:53.518 --> 30:54.519
I trust you.

30:54.602 --> 30:57.105
If your headaches aren't an issue,
don't report them.

30:57.188 --> 30:59.190
I'll submit what you think is best.

31:10.618 --> 31:13.371
I suppose cleaners have to go
where the work takes them.

31:13.454 --> 31:18.376
We both know what Kate Kaplan would
think of a buffoon like Laszlo Jankowics.

31:18.459 --> 31:20.628
Still, I'm sure he keeps you busy.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.630
Say something, Clara.

31:22.714 --> 31:26.634
You know who I am, and I suspect
you know exactly why I'm here.

31:26.718 --> 31:29.012
-Laszlo gave me up?
-Certainly not.

31:29.095 --> 31:31.055
Laszlo has no idea we're meeting.

31:31.139 --> 31:34.559
Don't let me keep you
from doing what you came here to do.

31:34.642 --> 31:36.936
-You want me to clean?
-[Raymond] Indeed.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.772
Fortunately, it's corn syrup
and food coloring.

31:39.856 --> 31:43.860
And if Kate taught you the trade,
this should be a walk in the park.

31:49.949 --> 31:51.034
TAC team standby.

31:51.117 --> 31:53.369
-We have eyes on the shipment.
-[man] <i>We're in position.</i>

31:53.453 --> 31:56.122
[Dembe] Nobody moves
until Laszlo take possession.

31:56.205 --> 31:59.250
-On your go.
-Sure that's the right container?

31:59.334 --> 32:00.293
Has to be.

32:00.376 --> 32:03.922
It originated in Jakarta, where
the Phan cartel has people at the port.

32:04.005 --> 32:09.302
Manifest says it has two dozen crates
of spearmint-flavored aerosol spray.

32:09.385 --> 32:10.470
[Park] Could be liquid LSD.

32:10.553 --> 32:13.431
Or Laszlo is a real stickler
for fresh breath.

32:13.514 --> 32:15.600
East entrance. Rolling in now.

32:24.609 --> 32:26.319
[Dembe] <i>We have Laszlo plus five.</i>

32:26.402 --> 32:28.947
<i>He must have a connection,</i>
<i>that's the port manager.</i>

32:33.284 --> 32:36.412
[Raymond] I'm told you and Kate
were very close at the end.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.122
Yes.

32:38.915 --> 32:39.958
I'm sorry.

32:41.042 --> 32:43.753
You're sorry? You murdered her.

32:45.546 --> 32:46.506
[Raymond] Okay, Clara.

32:46.589 --> 32:51.052
We've reached the end of the friendly
get-to-know-you portion.

32:51.135 --> 32:54.430
I'm afraid things get harder from here.

32:55.181 --> 32:57.642
First, I didn't kill Kate Kaplan.

32:57.725 --> 32:59.811
The fact is, she took her own life.

32:59.894 --> 33:03.147
Second, I feel terribly about that.

33:03.231 --> 33:06.317
Regardless of how she felt
about me at the time,

33:06.401 --> 33:10.446
we'd been friends for many years,
and I cared a great deal for Kate.

33:10.530 --> 33:14.742
And I've had to live with the
circumstances of her death ever since.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.244
That is, until yesterday,

33:16.327 --> 33:20.581
when it came to my attention
that she may not be dead after all.

33:22.375 --> 33:23.543
Kate's alive?

33:23.626 --> 33:28.631
I wonder. Was that a genuine question?
Or just an attempt to keep her hidden?

33:29.424 --> 33:32.844
I don't know what that means.
Not that it matters.

33:33.886 --> 33:36.014
I'd die before I'd tell you anything.

33:36.097 --> 33:40.184
Here's an idea. Why don't I introduce you
to an associate of mine?

33:41.102 --> 33:43.187
-Brimley?
-Yes. You've heard of him.

33:43.271 --> 33:44.814
-No.
-[Raymond] I'm not surprised.

33:44.897 --> 33:46.983
-Not to worry. You'll love him.
-No.

33:47.066 --> 33:49.235
He and Kate were old friends.

33:53.322 --> 33:54.657
<i>Wait for the hand off.</i>

33:57.827 --> 33:59.787
That's all we need.
Move in. We're good to go.

34:00.496 --> 34:02.498
We've got movement, 2 o'clock.

34:09.213 --> 34:11.090
-Laszlo's running.
-I see him.

34:23.394 --> 34:24.395
Drop the gun!

35:09.690 --> 35:13.069
[high-pitched ringing]

35:15.321 --> 35:17.990
Dembe, I don't have him.

35:18.658 --> 35:21.119
[Dembe] <i>I'm coming.</i>
<i>Which way is he moving?</i>

35:22.578 --> 35:24.288
Alina? Alina!

35:25.373 --> 35:26.582
Alina, are you okay?

35:32.213 --> 35:33.297
How do you feel?

35:34.257 --> 35:36.592
On the bright side,
I can see and hear again.

35:36.676 --> 35:39.637
But that would be the only bright side.

35:40.388 --> 35:43.266
SWAT's been all over the neighborhood.
No sign of Laszlo.

35:44.225 --> 35:45.685
Or his lion.

35:49.272 --> 35:51.357
A round went off inside the container.

35:51.440 --> 35:54.402
From then, I just couldn't think.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.613
And then the sunlight,
when I ran out again.

35:57.697 --> 36:00.449
Your two triggers:
bright lights, loud sounds.

36:01.117 --> 36:03.536
Maybe you should let them
take you to the hospital.

36:03.619 --> 36:06.789
I've seen enough doctors.
We both know what happened and why.

36:07.665 --> 36:08.624
The worst part?

36:09.792 --> 36:12.670
It's not about me. I lost Laszlo.

36:12.753 --> 36:14.797
We needed him for Cooper.

36:16.132 --> 36:17.592
He's almost out of time.

36:22.638 --> 36:25.474
Hey. Thanks for calling. How is she?

36:25.558 --> 36:27.435
Okay. Pretty shaken up.

36:28.227 --> 36:30.104
-And Laszlo?
-We lost him.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.272
But it's not over.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.900
Dembe's got Metro PD
and half the Bureau out looking.

36:37.945 --> 36:40.531
I went home. Saw my wife.

36:40.615 --> 36:43.117
Lost a vicious game
of Crazy Eights to Agnes.

36:43.951 --> 36:47.830
What I'm saying is, I took a minute
to remember what's important to me.

36:47.914 --> 36:50.166
And you, Donald.

36:50.249 --> 36:52.210
You're high on that list.
Sorry for earlier.

36:52.293 --> 36:54.170
-You don't have to.
-Yes, I do.

36:54.253 --> 36:57.757
I'm well aware that the trouble I'm in
is trouble of my own making.

36:57.840 --> 37:01.219
Trouble that's affecting
everyone around me. I'm sorry.

37:01.302 --> 37:04.972
And if I haven't said it, thank you
for doing everything you can to help me.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.350
-You'd do the same for me.
-Yes.

37:08.434 --> 37:11.479
The point is, you were right.
At the moment, nothing makes sense.

37:11.562 --> 37:15.107
Maybe the scam that Lacroix and Cole
were running is meaningless.

37:15.191 --> 37:17.151
Or maybe it's the key to everything.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.320
The only way to know
is to keep moving forward.

37:19.403 --> 37:21.572
-[cell phone ringing]
-It's Reddington.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.492
Raymond. I don't have good news.

37:24.575 --> 37:27.828
-You lost Laszlo Jankowics.
-Yes. How did you know?

37:27.912 --> 37:32.583
He just reached out to Marvin, asking for
my help in getting out of town undetected.

37:32.667 --> 37:34.877
<i>Not to worry, Harold.</i>
<i>He won't be going anywhere.</i>

37:34.961 --> 37:37.713
Our little lion tamer
is in for a big surprise.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.590
It's an evening of surprises.

37:39.674 --> 37:44.512
And that one's not even in the top two.
I need to see you. Come to the warehouse.

37:45.513 --> 37:48.808
He has a line on Laszlo
and he wants to talk, tonight.

37:50.726 --> 37:52.061
Say that again.

37:52.144 --> 37:54.438
-I'd rather not.
-You think Kate Kaplan is alive?

37:54.522 --> 37:58.442
I didn't say that. I said it's come
to my attention that she may be alive.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.569
And that's why you gave us Laszlo?

38:00.653 --> 38:03.155
To get to his cleaner, who knows for sure?

38:03.239 --> 38:06.158
I said she may know.
It's a fluid situation.

38:06.242 --> 38:08.786
Which is why I asked Brimley to join us.

38:08.869 --> 38:10.288
-Brimley's here.
-He is.

38:10.371 --> 38:11.789
[Cooper] I don't understand.

38:11.872 --> 38:15.668
Kaplan survived that fall
and what, she's been in hiding?

38:15.751 --> 38:18.004
Unlikely, but unknown.

38:18.087 --> 38:20.464
If she lived, she would've needed help.

38:20.548 --> 38:25.136
The woman's name is Clara Moore.
She and Kate were very close.

38:26.887 --> 38:30.266
I'm done.
And I'm certain she's telling the truth.

38:30.349 --> 38:32.310
What the hell is this?

38:32.393 --> 38:34.312
Like I said, it's a fluid situation.

38:34.395 --> 38:37.398
Telling the truth about what, Teddy?
Is Kate alive or not?

38:37.481 --> 38:38.482
[Theodore] She don't know.

38:38.566 --> 38:42.528
Until two days ago, she thought Kate
was kaput like the rest of us.

38:42.611 --> 38:43.779
But then she got a note.

38:43.863 --> 38:46.615
She came home. It was
in the bedroom on her night table.

38:46.699 --> 38:49.952
And yes, she's convinced
it's Kate's handwriting.

38:50.036 --> 38:52.121
She destroyed it, so we can't be sure.

38:52.204 --> 38:53.247
Two days ago?

38:53.331 --> 38:57.001
That's her story and believe me,
she's sticking to it.

38:57.084 --> 39:00.087
According to her, the note said,

39:00.171 --> 39:06.093
"Clara. I'm sorry. So much to explain.
I'm hoping you'll let me try."

39:06.761 --> 39:09.055
That's it. Then an address downtown.

39:09.138 --> 39:11.390
-10:00 p.m., Friday.
-[Weecha] That's tonight.

39:11.474 --> 39:15.144
-Less than two hours from now.
-So much to explain.

39:15.227 --> 39:18.773
Why now? After all this time,
why reach out like that?

39:19.565 --> 39:21.359
Let's take a ride, Harold.

39:21.442 --> 39:25.946
Who knows? Maybe I'll be
reacquainted with an old friend.

39:28.574 --> 39:29.617
[knocking on door]

39:29.700 --> 39:32.995
Agent Park. Hey.
You're here. Is everything all right?

39:33.079 --> 39:35.164
-I thought you were going home.
-I'm going now.

39:35.247 --> 39:37.750
But I wanted to get this back to you.

39:39.251 --> 39:41.921
I know I said my headaches
weren't an issue...

39:44.590 --> 39:45.424
Alina.

39:47.218 --> 39:50.429
-I'm so sorry.
-You don't have to worry about it.

39:50.513 --> 39:52.640
I did it myself. It's all in there.

39:52.723 --> 39:54.308
Are you okay?

39:54.392 --> 39:58.854
I was hard on Ressler for putting
the rest of us at risk with his addiction.

39:58.938 --> 40:01.690
I may be disabled,
but I'm not a hypocrite.

40:01.774 --> 40:03.943
What if Main Justice takes you out?

40:04.026 --> 40:06.487
If they don't, you should.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.115
It's okay, Aram.

40:09.198 --> 40:10.574
Just send it.

40:15.079 --> 40:16.288
[door closes]

40:19.542 --> 40:24.296
You believe it? Elizabeth's death.
Doug Koster. That poor bartender.

40:24.380 --> 40:25.631
My blackmail.

40:25.714 --> 40:30.511
I'm sitting here trying to understand how
or why Mr. Kaplan could've done it all.

40:33.639 --> 40:37.977
I've often wondered what I'd say
to her if I had the chance.

40:38.060 --> 40:38.978
And?

40:42.648 --> 40:47.111
The prospect is more overwhelming
than I'd imagined.

40:47.778 --> 40:50.156
Seeing her again, and what?

40:52.450 --> 40:54.535
What do I do if it is her, Harold?

40:57.455 --> 40:58.956
[ominous music playing]

41:08.591 --> 41:10.801
Oh-- There she is.

41:12.887 --> 41:15.431
Oh, my God. It really is her.

41:16.348 --> 41:18.601
I don't know if I'm ready to do this.

41:22.563 --> 41:25.774
You stay here.
Watch that window. We've got this.

41:29.778 --> 41:30.863
Are you sure, Weecha?

41:30.946 --> 41:31.780
I'm sure.

<i>Two down. She had guards watching.</i>

41:59.850 --> 42:02.102
