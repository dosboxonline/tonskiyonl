[hip-hop music playing]

00:04.004 --> 00:07.507
Trip, tell me this is the last
we'll hear from that pissant.

00:07.590 --> 00:10.135
I can't waste any more time in court

00:10.218 --> 00:13.471
bickering about patent law
or intellectual infringement.

00:13.555 --> 00:17.350
[Trip] <i>Listen, as soon as his star witness</i>

00:17.434 --> 00:19.519

00:19.602 --> 00:21.229
Best justice money can buy.

00:21.312 --> 00:23.773
<i>You're now in sole control of Genocyte.</i>

00:23.857 --> 00:26.359
<i>-It's time for you to celebrate.</i>
-Oh!

00:26.943 --> 00:29.112
I'm way ahead of you, esquire.

[keypad beeps]

00:38.913 --> 00:40.081
[coughing]

00:57.682 --> 01:01.352
[Michael] There's a special place in hell
for people like you.

01:01.436 --> 01:06.191
The rich and powerful who play
with others' lives just because you can.

01:06.274 --> 01:10.904
The world thinks you're in your castle
celebrating, but you're not.

01:10.987 --> 01:13.031
In fact, you're haunted.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.283
Read these.

01:16.117 --> 01:17.202
No.

01:20.580 --> 01:21.748
I understand.

01:21.831 --> 01:25.418
You're used to giving orders,
not taking them.

01:25.502 --> 01:28.338
Feeling empowered.
So I give you some power.

01:28.421 --> 01:32.258
You choose to read these or we kill you.

01:35.845 --> 01:36.888
[camera beeps]

01:41.059 --> 01:43.311
"My name is Adam McHenry.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.688
And this is my confession.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.109
I'm a liar and a thief.

01:49.192 --> 01:52.403
And to my best friend, Andrew Freeson,

01:53.279 --> 01:54.656
I'm so sorry."

01:57.534 --> 01:58.451
You did well.

01:59.869 --> 02:02.664
One more thing.
You have a date with gravity.

02:02.747 --> 02:05.291
I read what you wanted!
You said you wouldn't kill me!

02:05.375 --> 02:06.209
Yes, right.

02:06.292 --> 02:09.796
What I meant was
people will not think that I killed you.

02:09.879 --> 02:13.716
They will hear your confession
and think that you killed yourself.

02:13.800 --> 02:14.926
Wait, please!

02:15.009 --> 02:17.971
-Like I said, you're haunted.
-No!

02:18.054 --> 02:20.473
Stop! Hey! Wait!

02:30.567 --> 02:31.985
[cell phone buzzing]

02:52.463 --> 02:54.007
A parking garage?

02:54.090 --> 02:56.384
You woke up in a parking garage?

02:56.467 --> 02:57.802
Near Dupont Circle.

02:59.178 --> 03:00.597
Can't remember how I got there.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.599
Said you were going to a retirement party.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.851
For Jim Ritter over at Justice.

03:04.934 --> 03:06.644
I had one drink. Maybe two.

03:06.728 --> 03:10.106
Honey, you don't sleep in the car
after one or two drinks.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.400
Then maybe it was more.

03:12.483 --> 03:13.318
Can't remember.

03:13.401 --> 03:15.403
You scared the hell out of me.

03:15.486 --> 03:17.488
If it makes you feel better,
I scared myself.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.866
Not hearing from you.
Not knowing where you were.

03:19.949 --> 03:21.492
I waited by the phone all night.

03:21.576 --> 03:24.871
When the phone did ring,
it was from my friend Beth.

03:24.954 --> 03:26.080
And the way she sounded,

03:26.164 --> 03:28.541
she asked me if I'd heard what happened.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.543
I thought she was talking about you.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.462
I'm sorry I scared you.

03:33.713 --> 03:34.714
I'm fine.

03:34.797 --> 03:35.882
I know.

03:35.965 --> 03:37.634
And that means everything.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.011
Honey, there's something else.

03:40.094 --> 03:43.348
Beth said something happened?
Who was she talking about?

03:44.307 --> 03:45.475
Doug Koster.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.479
What are you doing with a key
to our neighbor's cabin?

03:51.856 --> 03:53.858
It happened before you got sick.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.986
We were in such a different place.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.697
You were working all the time.
I was lonely.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.950
Beth kept in touch with him.

04:02.533 --> 04:03.576
What happened?

04:03.660 --> 04:05.703
He was shot and killed last night.

04:18.424 --> 04:19.801
Where in the hell--?

04:24.138 --> 04:25.682
[Heddie] How do you like the place?

04:25.765 --> 04:27.892
It's nice.

04:28.643 --> 04:32.313
It's our own little hideaway in the woods.
Just like at home.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.399
Like at home. But not home.

04:34.482 --> 04:35.817
No, not even close.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.611
But thank you
for finding it for us, Heddie.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.823
Mm. This is delicious. What is it?

04:41.906 --> 04:44.409
A maté infusion from the yerba maté plant.

04:44.492 --> 04:45.952
[Raymond] We grow them.

04:46.035 --> 04:48.329
Mierce has two green thumbs

04:48.413 --> 04:52.417
and an extraordinary knowledge
of everything that's good for you

04:52.500 --> 04:54.711
and everything else that isn't.

04:54.794 --> 04:55.962
Including people.

04:56.045 --> 04:57.213
Speaking of,

04:57.297 --> 05:02.176
tell me about the operations
we still have running with Oleg Nikovich.

05:02.260 --> 05:06.597
He's provided us with contacts
to move minerals out of Afghanistan,

05:06.681 --> 05:08.349
for which he's been well-paid.

05:08.433 --> 05:12.395
We moved $100 million worth last year,

05:12.478 --> 05:14.272
taking 19% off the top.

05:14.355 --> 05:16.649
Not an arrangement we want to upend.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.944
Not if you like 19% of 100 million.

05:20.028 --> 05:20.945
Why do you ask?

05:21.029 --> 05:24.032
Because Oleg has been
a loyal partner and friend.

05:24.115 --> 05:27.660
And yet I need to take something
off his hands.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.413
That's $19 million annually.

05:30.496 --> 05:31.706
Don't piss him off.

05:31.789 --> 05:32.874
[Raymond] I don't intend to.

05:32.957 --> 05:35.001
But what I need is locked away

05:35.084 --> 05:38.838
in that monstrosity of a penthouse
he keeps as a tax shelter.

05:38.921 --> 05:43.384
The man's there one week
out of the year at most.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.261
He'll never know it's gone.

05:45.344 --> 05:47.513
-Where's the building?
-A toothpick of a place

05:47.597 --> 05:50.600
on 57th Street in Manhattan.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.143
You should call Rogelio.

05:52.226 --> 05:53.811
He'll know the super.

05:54.645 --> 05:59.150
Ah! Dembe. Not seeing you,
I was beginning to wonder.

05:59.233 --> 06:00.943
[Raymond] Thank you for coming, Heddie.

06:01.027 --> 06:04.489
-I'm gonna take this to go.
-It's fine. Take the gourd.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.368
Let me know what Rogelio says.

06:09.452 --> 06:10.578
Please, sit.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.503
Would you like anything to drink?

06:18.586 --> 06:20.088
No. Thank you.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.263
Well, this is uncomfortable.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.224
Because I arrested Vesco?

06:32.058 --> 06:34.435
Vesco was a disappointment.

06:35.019 --> 06:36.395
Brasília was a tragedy.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.064
We should talk about it.

06:40.274 --> 06:42.026
Your burns. Are they healing?

06:42.110 --> 06:43.486
They are.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.364
I never thanked you for coming back
after I was injured.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.908
I came back for Agnes.

06:48.991 --> 06:50.868
You came back for me.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.663
You stayed for Agnes.

06:55.498 --> 06:56.707
I have a case.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.086
So we're not going to talk about Brasília?

07:00.169 --> 07:02.672
Two tech partners have a falling out.

07:02.755 --> 07:06.384
One accuses the other
of stealing his intellectual property.

07:06.467 --> 07:07.343
He sues.

07:07.426 --> 07:08.553
He loses.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.471
And what does the winner do?

07:10.555 --> 07:13.433
Mr. McHenry goes home

07:13.516 --> 07:16.519
and performs a reverse pike
off of his balcony.

07:16.602 --> 07:20.356
After filming a suicide note
admitting his guilt.

07:21.315 --> 07:23.609
I hear rumors that the suicide note

07:23.693 --> 07:28.030
and Mr. McHenry's untimely demise
were the work of the Avenging Angel.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.616
Michael from Amsterdam.

07:30.700 --> 07:31.534
Bruges.

07:32.118 --> 07:37.123
Her insistent effort to restore
wartime plunder to its rightful owners,

07:37.206 --> 07:41.043
among her other avid pursuits,
is often nasty business.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.087
Which I recall you agreed with.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.301
What the hell happened to us?

07:51.220 --> 07:55.016
Michael. The archangel?
The one that God sent to fight the devil?

07:55.099 --> 07:57.643
A job she does
with an almost heavenly zeal.

07:57.727 --> 08:01.063
Stealing from those who have stolen.
Returning what was unjustly taken.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.273
Sounds angelic.

08:02.356 --> 08:04.400
According to Raymond,
she rights these wrongs

08:04.484 --> 08:07.111
through murder, extortion,
random acts of violence.

08:07.195 --> 08:10.031
When a Japanese court
acquitted executives of responsibility

08:10.114 --> 08:11.866
for the nuclear meltdown in Fukushima,

08:11.949 --> 08:15.661
she committed a ransomware attack,
extracting millions for displaced victims.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.580
Over the course of a decade,

08:17.663 --> 08:20.374
she committed so many acts of terror
against a Florida town,

08:20.458 --> 08:22.585
officials eventually agreed to her demands

08:22.668 --> 08:24.629
and gave back land to the descendants

08:24.712 --> 08:27.673
of Black families who had been
run off their property in the '20s.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.800
And yesterday she murders
the CEO of Genocyte

08:29.884 --> 08:31.719
and makes it look like suicide.

08:31.802 --> 08:34.013
Complete with a taped confession.

08:34.680 --> 08:39.060
<i>I leave my shares of Genocyte</i>
<i>to the person they rightfully belong to,</i>

08:40.269 --> 08:41.395
<i>Andrew Freeson.</i>

08:42.730 --> 08:44.232
<i>Please forgive me, Andy.</i>

08:45.107 --> 08:47.777
Does Reddington have any idea
who her next target is?

08:47.860 --> 08:49.153
He doesn't know.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.906
Whether she acts alone or is a hired gun.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.908
[Cooper] <i>If someone did hire her,</i>

08:53.991 --> 08:56.577
<i>chances are it's the man</i>
<i>who thinks McHenry made a fortune</i>

08:56.661 --> 08:57.995
<i>after stealing his IP.</i>

08:58.079 --> 09:00.873
Andrew Freeson sued
for his fair share and lost.

09:00.957 --> 09:03.417
Now McHenry's dead
and Freeson owns the company.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.336
<i>I think that merits a sit-down.</i>

09:05.419 --> 09:07.213
Park, Dembe, bring him in.

09:07.296 --> 09:08.923
I'll go with her.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.301
-Coming in today, sir?
<i>-Should be.</i>

09:12.385 --> 09:15.096
<i>I just have to check</i>
<i>on a friend of Charlene's.</i>

09:15.179 --> 09:16.055
[keypad beeps]

09:30.695 --> 09:34.240
Detective Heber, Homicide.
May I ask why you're stopped here?

09:34.323 --> 09:36.492
Just wanted to see
what the commotion was about.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.327
This is a crime scene, sir.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.205
-Not a roadside attraction.
-Right. I'm leaving.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.456
[engine starting]

09:46.627 --> 09:47.670
[camera clicks]

09:52.592 --> 09:54.844
You were right.
This job does keep me straight.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.430
That isn't the reason
you bumped Dembe off.

09:57.513 --> 10:01.183
-What am I missing?
-My second drug test's later today.

10:02.184 --> 10:05.229
If I don't pass, even if
I come up inconclusive, I'm out.

10:05.313 --> 10:08.316
And because I came up
inconclusive last time,

10:08.399 --> 10:10.318
they're coming into the stall.

10:10.401 --> 10:11.652
That's cozy.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.654
Point is, I need a clean sample.

10:13.738 --> 10:14.947
Not sure I have one.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.158
But you do.

10:17.742 --> 10:18.826
I'm not giving it.

10:18.909 --> 10:21.245
I can't believe you're asking me
to help cheat.

10:21.329 --> 10:24.206
I'm not using. I'm not sure
if I've been off long enough.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.917
I need this.
This is the only way I keep it.

10:27.001 --> 10:29.295
-No.
-If you don't, I'm off the force.

10:29.378 --> 10:32.590
-Out of the bureau.
-If we're caught, we're both out.

10:33.257 --> 10:34.133
Forget it.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.595
It's not a risk I'm willing to take.

10:38.888 --> 10:39.930
I said, forget it.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.933
It's my problem. I never should've tried
to make it yours.

10:43.559 --> 10:45.603
Really, it's all good.

10:50.566 --> 10:52.360
[Ressler] You and McHenry were partners.

10:52.443 --> 10:56.155
Yes. We founded Genocyte
in my parents' garage.

10:56.238 --> 10:57.365
He was my oldest friend.

10:57.448 --> 11:00.743
Who you accused of making a fortune
stealing your intellectual property.

11:00.826 --> 11:03.621
You asked how well I knew him,
not what I thought of him.

11:03.704 --> 11:05.414
What did you think of him?

11:05.998 --> 11:09.126
That he was a liar and a cheat.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.589
ADA Morehouse's office, please.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.217
Bill. Harold.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.637
A homicide report should be filed
today on a Doug Koster.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.348
I need you to send me a copy.
My eyes only.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.600
I owe you, pal.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.894
What have I missed?

11:26.977 --> 11:28.104
They're in with Freeson.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.981
-[Park] Do you think he was suicidal?
-No.

11:31.065 --> 11:35.111
-You think he was murdered?
-I don't know what to think or feel.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.946
I'm just numb.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.323
You're also very rich now.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.033
[Park] McHenry taped a confession.

11:41.117 --> 11:45.079
He admitted to cheating you
and gave you his share of the company.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.249
That's the first I'm hearing of that.

11:48.332 --> 11:51.710
You spent years in court trying to get
what you say you deserve.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.964
You lost, but now McHenry winds up dead,

11:55.047 --> 11:56.132
and you get everything.

11:56.215 --> 12:00.261
Are you suggesting
that I killed my best friend?

12:00.344 --> 12:02.721
You mean the liar and the cheat?

12:03.222 --> 12:04.640
Sure, that's who he was.

12:04.723 --> 12:08.060
But he was also my oldest friend.

12:08.561 --> 12:09.937
Where were you last night?

12:10.020 --> 12:12.898
I'd lost in court. So I was at home.

12:15.526 --> 12:16.777
I work in tech, okay?

12:16.861 --> 12:20.072
Screaming into that void
is the only thing that helps.

12:21.907 --> 12:25.536
Do you really think
I was at Adam's place killing him?

12:26.036 --> 12:28.622
-Were you?
-This conversation's over.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.332
I want my lawyer.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.418
Okay, Freeson said
that thing about blogging,

12:32.501 --> 12:36.630
so I looked up his online footprint
and guy's got profiles everywhere.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.966
And then I found this.

12:39.049 --> 12:40.551
This is Thread-Net.

12:40.634 --> 12:43.220
It's an online discussion platform
sort of like Reddit.

12:43.304 --> 12:46.223
And it looks like Freeson
found a deep subcategory

12:46.307 --> 12:49.852
and vented about the court case,
McHenry, his betrayal.

12:49.935 --> 12:50.936
A category about what?

12:51.020 --> 12:52.021
A prayer group.

12:52.104 --> 12:56.358
It's people pouring out their pain
and problems for divine intervention.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.819
The profile that is hosting this thread?

12:59.820 --> 13:02.114
AvengingAngel1317.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.909
Answering prayers.
That's how she's picking her crimes.

13:04.992 --> 13:05.826
Perfect, actually.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.037
Host an anonymous, worldwide platform

13:08.120 --> 13:09.622
and let the injustices roll in.

13:09.705 --> 13:12.917
We have her profile.
We run it down, we find our angel.

Uh, sir?

13:14.543 --> 13:16.670
Is everything okay with Charlene's friend?

13:16.754 --> 13:18.672
At the moment it's a mystery.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.424
-Anything I can do?
-No.

13:20.508 --> 13:21.467
Thanks.

13:21.550 --> 13:24.094
I'm doing everything I can
to figure out what happened.

-One click will get you in.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.601

13:30.684 --> 13:32.186
I can't thank you enough.

13:32.269 --> 13:35.231
Thank Rogelio. He helped get my daughter
into Princeton this fall.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.649
How wonderful for her.

13:36.732 --> 13:38.108
Go Tigers!

13:39.360 --> 13:41.278
Easy in, easy out.

13:41.362 --> 13:44.907
And there's excellent pastrami
right around the corner.

How is it, bro?

13:56.585 --> 13:58.587
Alexei, what a surprise!

13:58.671 --> 14:01.590
I stopped by to see
if your father was in town.

14:01.674 --> 14:02.841
He's not.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.594
But come in.
I'm having a little get-together.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.721
Vodka's cold. The girls are hot.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.103
Hey. Aram ran down that angel profile.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.814
Log-ins from different routers
in a dozen countries.

14:16.897 --> 14:20.150

the locals. The out-of-towners are ours.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.156
Freeson was betrayed by McHenry.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.326
He was hurt by him.
But in the end, he loved him.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.704
-Thank you.
-I hope it works.

14:31.787 --> 14:33.038
I'm not as nice as Freeson.

Screw this up and I won't sue you,

14:54.059 --> 14:55.895
Read that online prayer group?

14:55.978 --> 14:56.896
A bunch of it.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.606
What were they posting?

14:58.689 --> 15:00.482
Tragedy, grief, confession.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.610
Our blacklister waded through
a lot of anguish

15:02.693 --> 15:04.695
to find her needles in a haystack.

15:06.363 --> 15:09.617
She takes advantage of people
searching for peace.

15:10.492 --> 15:13.037
Hey! Any chance you're city inspectors?

15:13.120 --> 15:15.039
No. We're FBI.

15:15.122 --> 15:17.124
-Why do you ask?
-Been calling.

15:17.207 --> 15:19.710
-Calling about what?
-This house.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.921
It's been empty for two years.

16:24.316 --> 16:25.359
Oh, my God!

16:32.574 --> 16:35.327
[Dembe] Aram, take a look at this.

16:35.411 --> 16:36.537
What did you find?

16:39.164 --> 16:40.666
A link to the past.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.503
Rosary beads.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.551

17:04.023 --> 17:05.649
Hmm? William Green.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.609
Anything?

17:08.485 --> 17:09.903
I've never heard of him.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.740
I didn't think so.

17:12.823 --> 17:16.577
But in a few hours, trust me,
he'll be unforgettable.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.166
It's kind of beautiful.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.293
The heart of an artist.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.336
And the mind of a killer.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.546
What did you track down?

17:27.629 --> 17:30.549
I ran the hospital bracelet
that we found on site.

17:30.632 --> 17:33.802
No baby name, but the year was '83.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.263
Sant'Agata Hospital outside Rome.

17:36.346 --> 17:38.724
The mother was a Michela Bellucci.

17:38.807 --> 17:40.100
No father's name.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.727
Michela to Michael.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.353
Pretty close if this is our angel.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.522
-Is this a hospital photo?
-No.

17:45.606 --> 17:48.484
So Dembe also found a rosary at the scene.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.070
The cross was inscribed with the name
of a local convent

17:51.153 --> 17:52.905
right near that hospital.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.031
The convent was listed

17:54.114 --> 17:56.450
as Michela's residence
at the time of the birth.

17:56.533 --> 17:59.244
Don't tell me our avenging angel
is a former nun.

17:59.328 --> 18:00.662
It's deeper than that.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.457
It turns out Michela
was a young, unwed mother,

18:03.540 --> 18:06.168
practically a deadly sin
to some back then.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.837
Her parents all but disowned her.

18:08.921 --> 18:12.049
The convent took in hundreds
of similar cases like this at that time.

18:12.132 --> 18:15.469
There have been investigations
into places like this all over Europe.

18:15.552 --> 18:18.347
She would've been a prisoner
for the length of her pregnancy.

18:18.430 --> 18:22.059
When she gave birth, she would've been
forced to give the baby up for adoption.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.268
They took her baby?

18:23.352 --> 18:27.231
And now our angel steals back
for those who've had things stolen.

18:27.314 --> 18:30.442
While carrying around a hospital bracelet
and an old rosary.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.361
She never let go of her past.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.029
Michela barely has a past.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.199
She disappears off public records
shortly after the birth.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.659
[Cooper] Do you have an update?

18:38.742 --> 18:41.161
We have Michael's real name.
I'll send out a BOLO.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.956

from that house you found.

18:59.012 --> 19:01.181
I'll handle it on my own for now.

So you're living here, Alexei?

19:47.477 --> 19:50.772
Or is this just an impromptu get-together?

19:50.856 --> 19:53.025
I'm crashing here for a few weeks.

19:53.108 --> 19:54.526
If I remember correctly,

19:54.610 --> 19:57.613
you have quite a place. Where is it?

19:57.696 --> 19:59.448
Dalmatian Coast, Croatia?

19:59.531 --> 20:01.283
Yeah. I had to sell that.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.285
An unforeseen cash-flow problem.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.204
-Cash flow?
-It's nothing.

20:05.954 --> 20:07.497
I was betting oil futures.

20:07.581 --> 20:10.375
It was stupid.
I just need time to get back on my feet.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.628
Shame to sell the villa, though.

20:12.711 --> 20:16.215
Nothing retains its value
like a good piece of real estate.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.674
Or a good piece of art.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.801
What the hell do I know about art?

20:21.678 --> 20:23.805
[Raymond] Take that painting for example.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.724
Your father's had it for years.

20:25.807 --> 20:29.686
It's a perfect representation
of the style.

20:29.770 --> 20:33.607
Clean lines, geometric use of the space.

20:33.690 --> 20:35.234
What an investment.

20:35.317 --> 20:38.403
That's someone's retirement
hanging on that wall.

20:40.155 --> 20:41.448
How much we talking?

20:42.532 --> 20:44.117
Oh, my goodness.

20:44.201 --> 20:48.789
Look, I could have a row of buyers
lined up by lunch.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.582
You could name a price.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.334
Beautiful.

20:53.335 --> 20:55.003
Ah, but you'd never.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.339
Means too much to your father.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.591
He's never here.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.551
He can't love it that much.

21:02.636 --> 21:06.682
These buyers,
what could you get from them?

21:06.765 --> 21:09.309
Please, I can't put a price on perfection.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.395
Pretend like you can.

21:11.478 --> 21:14.690
I mean, I'd be guessing,
but I think I know a collector

21:14.773 --> 21:17.359
who'd offer 500,000
just to get your attention.

21:17.442 --> 21:20.779
-That would help with some cash flow.
-It would.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.657
But, you know, it's Alexei's call.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.955
Think I could try for a million?

21:34.167 --> 21:35.377
[elevator bell dings]

21:36.795 --> 21:39.381
Is that painting really worth
a million dollars?

21:39.464 --> 21:40.507
-This?
-Yeah.

21:40.590 --> 21:44.553
Oleg stole this off the wall
of a Four Seasons in Maui.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.222
But it makes for lovely camouflage.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.976
Dembe and I were in Bruges a while back.

21:51.059 --> 21:54.271
We heard rumors of an avenging angel.

21:54.354 --> 21:59.776
Someone dedicated to putting her thumb
on the scales of injustice.

21:59.860 --> 22:02.946
She was on the hunt for this.

22:03.655 --> 22:07.284
Van Gogh's <i>The Painter</i>
<i>on the Road to Tarascon.</i>

22:07.367 --> 22:10.287
Stolen from its rightful owner
by the Nazis

22:10.370 --> 22:14.833
and thought to have been incinerated
when the Allies bombed Magdeburg.

22:14.916 --> 22:17.461
[Heddie] How did you know Nikovich had it?

22:17.544 --> 22:18.420
He showed it to me.

22:18.503 --> 22:22.924
Oleg is always very proud
of his newest shiny toy.

22:23.008 --> 22:26.928
He hid it, for obvious reasons,
and lost interest.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.096
But I never did.

22:28.180 --> 22:31.725
Now you're gonna use it as bait
to catch the Avenging Angel.

22:31.808 --> 22:35.520
That's my job, yes.
Yours is to contact the rightful owner.

22:36.396 --> 22:38.857
-Is he still alive?
-His daughter is.

22:38.940 --> 22:41.818
She's the lead singer
in a death metal band.

22:41.902 --> 22:44.362
-How old is she?
-Ninety-something.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.534
Okay, no. No way.

22:49.618 --> 22:52.037
[Francis]
The collector will be with you, watching.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.455
Yeah, I'm aware, but--

22:53.538 --> 22:57.167
The only way you'll pee out clean urine
is if I put clean urine in you.

22:57.250 --> 23:00.629
And I can do that by
running the sample you brought

23:00.712 --> 23:04.257
from this catheter,
through your penis, into your bladder.

23:04.341 --> 23:05.592
Is that possible?

23:05.675 --> 23:07.969
I spent a decade
as a team doctor for pro athletes.

23:08.053 --> 23:12.099
When you're playing for your
next contract, anything's possible.

23:12.182 --> 23:14.976
Those guys want it so badly,
they're willing to do anything.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.436
Are you?

23:20.816 --> 23:23.235
[Aram] We've gone through
the evidence files we got from MPD.

23:23.318 --> 23:26.404
These three men were in multiple
surveillance photos.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.907
-[Cooper] That's Derek Huntley.
-Should I know who that is?

23:28.990 --> 23:30.492
Seventy-second richest American.

23:30.575 --> 23:34.621
One of many sad facts I know
from hunting for an angel investor.

23:34.704 --> 23:35.664
And the others?

23:35.747 --> 23:39.376
[Aram] The second is Walter Conrad,
an administrator at St. Damian's Hospital.

23:39.459 --> 23:42.546
And the third is a steelworker
named William Green.

23:42.629 --> 23:46.675
-No idea what they have in common.
-Our archangel was watching all three.

23:46.758 --> 23:49.094
Bring them all in for questioning.

23:49.177 --> 23:52.139
Hey. Sorry I was late.
I had a personal issue to deal with.

23:53.014 --> 23:54.641
A lot of that going around.

24:05.485 --> 24:06.486
What do you want?

24:07.487 --> 24:08.655
Why am I here?

24:10.073 --> 24:14.744
Mr. Conrad, would you care
to enlighten our guest of honor?

24:16.329 --> 24:17.164
No?

24:17.247 --> 24:21.126
Mr. Conrad is what we call
in Italian <i>"pulisci il culo,"</i>

24:21.209 --> 24:22.252
an asswipe.

24:23.044 --> 24:25.505
Huntley is the person who gets wiped.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.258
And you are the refuse,

24:28.341 --> 24:31.720
the human garbage
they flush away every day.

24:31.803 --> 24:34.681
-I have no idea what you're talking about.
-Makes two of us.

24:34.764 --> 24:37.684
Well, then, allow me
to shed some light on things.

24:58.413 --> 25:01.917
How many times do I have to tell you?
It wasn't about sex.

25:02.417 --> 25:05.045
If it wasn't about sex,
why'd you have sex?

25:05.128 --> 25:08.215
-Why not invite him to your book club?
-I hate my book club.

25:08.298 --> 25:12.344
The only reason I joined that book club
is because you're never home.

25:12.427 --> 25:14.930
Doug was just, you know, company.

25:19.643 --> 25:20.477
Coop.

25:21.645 --> 25:22.771
Yo, Coop.

25:23.939 --> 25:25.357
Lew. Thanks for coming.

25:25.982 --> 25:27.776
What's with the cloak-and-dagger?

25:27.859 --> 25:31.780
-I need you to run a ballistics test.
-Okay. And...

25:31.863 --> 25:33.365
why can't you do that?

25:33.448 --> 25:36.076
Because the test is for my service weapon.

25:36.159 --> 25:38.078
This morning there was a round missing.

25:38.161 --> 25:40.121
I think my weapon was recently fired.

25:41.164 --> 25:46.127
If you think a round has been fired,
and it's your gun, shouldn't you know?

25:47.003 --> 25:50.215
-Ballistics, Lew, can you do it?
-How much trouble are you in?

25:50.298 --> 25:52.801
I don't know. That's what
I'm trusting you to find out.

26:01.893 --> 26:05.647
Sir, the three men from the photo
are all missing.

26:05.730 --> 26:06.815
Huntley was ambushed.

26:06.898 --> 26:09.734
The security detail
was gunned down in broad daylight.

26:09.818 --> 26:13.196
Conrad lived alone. We've brought in
Green's wife to see what she knows.

26:13.280 --> 26:17.200
Coordinate with MPD. If they have leads,
I wanna know. I'll be in my office.

26:18.159 --> 26:19.494
[monitor beeping]

26:25.834 --> 26:28.670
You took something
that does not belong to you.

26:28.753 --> 26:31.464
Something that rightfully
belongs to Mr. Green.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.383
You're crazy. I've never met this man.

26:33.466 --> 26:35.635
Mm. But you've met Mr. Conrad.

26:35.719 --> 26:39.556
He's here to explain
to Mr. Green what you stole

26:39.639 --> 26:42.767
and how you used your power
and influence to steal it.

26:42.851 --> 26:45.562
William went to the pharmacy
around the corner.

26:45.645 --> 26:49.316
When he didn't come back in an hour,
I went and was told he never showed up.

26:50.650 --> 26:52.277
Do you know who this is?

26:53.111 --> 26:54.612
No. Who is she?

26:55.613 --> 26:57.741
Why would she wanna do
something to my husband?

26:57.824 --> 27:01.953
[Michael] I don't want to do something
to you. I want to give something to you.

27:02.037 --> 27:04.080
Why was your husband
going to the pharmacy?

27:04.164 --> 27:05.498
He had a pacemaker installed.

27:05.582 --> 27:08.084
He was going to pick up
his heart meds, blood thinners.

27:08.168 --> 27:10.337
He can't survive without them.

27:10.420 --> 27:12.714
He has congestive heart failure.

27:12.797 --> 27:14.716
I want to give you a heart.

27:15.342 --> 27:17.510
Specifically, his heart.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.512
What? You can't do that.

27:19.596 --> 27:22.182
-I don't want you to hurt him.
-[Michael] Why not?

27:22.265 --> 27:24.642
He didn't care that he hurt you.

27:24.726 --> 27:28.313
Mr. Conrad, if you will.
How did you do it?

27:28.396 --> 27:30.690
My husband worked for
a steel company for 20 years.

27:30.774 --> 27:34.194
When his heart got bad, they helped him
get on the national transplant list.

27:34.277 --> 27:36.363
[Conrad] When an organ becomes available,

27:37.072 --> 27:40.283
it's first offered to people
near the donor's hospital,

27:40.367 --> 27:42.285
based on their placement on a waitlist.

27:42.369 --> 27:45.705
It took almost a year, but eventually,
William got to the top of the list.

27:45.789 --> 27:48.458
In this case,
the hospital was St. Damian's.

27:48.541 --> 27:51.378
-Is that your hospital?
-Yes.

27:51.461 --> 27:54.506
[Janelle] We were so excited.
The next heart was going to be his.

27:54.589 --> 27:59.094
William Green lives in
the donation radius of St. Damian's.

27:59.177 --> 28:02.555
Derek Huntley lives
on the other side of the state.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.057
Can you explain that?

28:04.140 --> 28:07.268
There are thousands of people
on donor lists all across the country.

28:07.352 --> 28:11.731
I'm sorry that this man did not
get a heart, but that is not my fault.

28:11.815 --> 28:14.442
But it is his fault, wasn't it?

28:15.068 --> 28:18.613
Derek offered to fully pay
for our new pediatric wing

28:18.696 --> 28:22.784
if I could ensure
the first heart available was his.

28:22.867 --> 28:25.829
If your husband was on top,
why didn't he receive a transplant?

28:25.912 --> 28:27.664
[Janelle]
He was at the top. He's not anymore.

28:27.747 --> 28:30.917
-[Ressler] Why not?
-He failed a test, a blood test.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.044
They were vague about it.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.672
After that, William kept getting
bumped down the list.

28:35.755 --> 28:39.759
So Mr. Huntley bribed his way
to the front of the line,

28:39.843 --> 28:42.429
effectively sentencing Mr. Green to death.

28:42.512 --> 28:44.472
[Janelle] <i>He doesn't have much time.</i>

28:44.556 --> 28:46.891
I just wanted the last couple months...

28:48.309 --> 28:50.103
I want him to be at peace.

28:50.186 --> 28:53.440
And now I don't understand
why this happened.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.860
Why would someone wanna do this to him?

28:56.943 --> 29:00.905
One more thing, Mrs. Green. Have you ever
posted on any discussion groups online?

29:00.989 --> 29:04.367
A prayer group, asking for
your husband to find a heart?

29:04.451 --> 29:05.493
How did you know?

29:05.577 --> 29:08.246
I didn't do anything to this man.

29:08.329 --> 29:10.081
I did something for myself.

29:10.165 --> 29:12.625
That's the way the world works.

29:12.709 --> 29:13.668
I know.

29:14.377 --> 29:16.379
That's why I'm so busy.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.131
Shall we?

29:18.214 --> 29:20.216
Wait. Wait, wait!

29:20.842 --> 29:23.344
-You're guessing?
-Yeah, but it's an educated guess.

29:23.428 --> 29:24.512
Look at the facts.

29:24.596 --> 29:28.016
Two months ago, William Green was
number one on the list for a new heart.

29:28.099 --> 29:30.143
He's near a hospital, ready to go,

29:30.226 --> 29:34.814
but suddenly, he gets disqualifying
test results that bump him down the list.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.900
At the same time,
a new wing at St. Damian's

29:36.983 --> 29:39.402
is named in honor of Derek Huntley.

29:42.530 --> 29:44.240
It's time for your drug test.

29:46.868 --> 29:48.578
If you need me, it can wait.

29:48.661 --> 29:51.456
What we need
is you to be reinstated. Good luck.

29:51.539 --> 29:52.832
Yeah. Thank you.

29:59.964 --> 30:02.300
-You can't do this!
-Why not?

30:02.383 --> 30:05.303
You behave like you're heartless.
Now you will be.

30:07.388 --> 30:11.142
[Park] You're right. It was a guess.
So I contacted the hospital.

30:11.226 --> 30:14.354
A week after Green was disqualified,
Huntley got a new heart,

30:14.437 --> 30:17.148
while Mr. Green got a pacemaker
and six months to live.

30:17.232 --> 30:19.234
Did Huntley get the heart
Green should have?

30:19.317 --> 30:20.652
Michael thinks so.

30:20.735 --> 30:23.613
She'll wanna give it back to Green
by taking it from Huntley.

30:23.696 --> 30:26.491
Do you have any idea where she's doing it?

30:26.574 --> 30:28.243
-Not yet.
-[Aram] Mr. Green has a pacemaker.

30:28.326 --> 30:31.996
It may be Bluetooth compatible
for sending diagnostics to his doctors.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.832
Find out as fast as you can.

30:38.503 --> 30:41.923
You won't believe this.
The trail that went cold in Bruges?

30:42.423 --> 30:43.508
It just got warm.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.221
-Who sent this?
-A fence in Baltimore.

30:48.304 --> 30:50.390
-Jericho.
-After all these years...

30:50.473 --> 30:53.184
He has a well-heeled client list.
We'd need to act quickly.

30:53.268 --> 30:55.311
Whatever the price, double it.

30:55.395 --> 30:58.189
I know what to do about the painting.
What about the owner?

30:58.273 --> 31:01.317
Tell Mr. Jericho the price
comes on one condition.

31:01.401 --> 31:03.611
I want a sit-down with the owner

31:03.695 --> 31:06.990
to find out what he knows about
the provenance of the painting.

31:07.740 --> 31:10.368
For his sake, I hope it's not much.

31:10.994 --> 31:14.539
You need to see my birthday suit?
I just got it tailored.

31:14.622 --> 31:16.040
That won't be necessary.

31:16.124 --> 31:17.876
Arms up, palms toward me.

31:19.919 --> 31:21.170
Is that necessary?

31:21.254 --> 31:22.672
Just following protocol.

31:22.755 --> 31:24.382
First test is inconclusive.

31:24.465 --> 31:27.010
We don't take any chances on number two.

31:34.058 --> 31:37.520
No pressure, but I got a 4:15
with the Joint Chiefs.

31:47.322 --> 31:51.159
[Raymond] Hello, Ada. Welcome.
I hope you had a comfortable trip.

31:51.242 --> 31:52.952
Oh, yes.

31:53.036 --> 31:54.621
Heddie was a dear.

31:55.496 --> 31:57.582
-I hear you're on tour.
-[Ada] I am.

31:57.665 --> 31:59.375
Dialysis permitting.

31:59.459 --> 32:00.919
I have a show tonight,

32:01.002 --> 32:05.506
but this nice lady says
you have a pleasant surprise for me.

32:05.590 --> 32:09.302
At my age, most surprises aren't,
so here I am.

32:09.385 --> 32:11.346
So please, come sit.

32:12.639 --> 32:14.974
Oh, no, no, no. It's all right.

32:15.058 --> 32:16.392
It's okay.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.853
I can manage. I am old, not, uh...
[chuckles]

32:34.202 --> 32:35.828
They took it...

32:37.622 --> 32:39.457
on a Thursday.

32:40.583 --> 32:43.211
On Friday, they took the rest of us.

32:48.132 --> 32:51.970
I only survived
because they heard me sing.

32:54.263 --> 32:55.682
I'm alive...

32:57.392 --> 33:00.561
because I sang
for the people who killed...

33:01.980 --> 33:03.022
my family.

33:04.357 --> 33:06.109
However did you find it?

33:06.192 --> 33:09.946
In a case of history
repeating itself, I stole it.

33:10.738 --> 33:13.241
From the current owner's apartment.

33:13.324 --> 33:17.537
I realize it's no recompense.
But maybe after all these years, it's...

33:18.830 --> 33:20.707
sentimental reparation.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.251
Who are you?

33:24.752 --> 33:25.795
Oh, that's--

33:26.295 --> 33:27.714
That's a longer story.

33:27.797 --> 33:31.718
-[cell phone ringing]
-Which I'll tell you right after this.

33:31.801 --> 33:32.885
Excuse me.

33:32.969 --> 33:33.928
Jericho.

33:34.554 --> 33:36.597
Yes, double the price is good.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.808
Wanting to meet me is even better.

33:39.475 --> 33:42.311
Twenty minutes. All I need is an address.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.022
Yes.

33:44.939 --> 33:48.985
I'm terribly sorry, Ada,
but something unavoidable has come up.

33:49.068 --> 33:50.820
So it's really mine to keep?

33:50.903 --> 33:52.113
[Raymond] It was always yours.

33:52.196 --> 33:56.325
It's just been in the wrong hands
for the past 81 years.

33:56.409 --> 33:57.952
-[cell phone ringing]
-Uh...

33:58.036 --> 34:00.747
This constant ringing,
I feel like Quasimodo.

34:01.372 --> 34:02.248
Harold.

34:02.749 --> 34:05.168
I was going to call you. Perfect timing.

34:05.251 --> 34:06.961
[Cooper] <i>It's not for Derek Huntley.</i>

34:07.045 --> 34:10.965
He cut in line and got the heart that
was supposed to go to someone else.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.925
Our angel is about to balance the scales.

34:13.009 --> 34:15.094
She'll murder Huntley,
and we don't know where.

34:15.178 --> 34:17.805
-Derek Huntley the billionaire?
-You're missing the point.

34:18.639 --> 34:21.517
-Good talk, Harold.
-Reddington? Are you--?

34:21.601 --> 34:24.228
-Sir, the pacemaker has Bluetooth.
-Is it still active?

34:24.312 --> 34:27.774
No. But the last GPS ping
came from the warehouse district.

34:27.857 --> 34:29.067
That's a big district.

34:29.150 --> 34:32.236
-We're right about the transplant surgery.
-How do you know?

34:32.320 --> 34:34.739
I know they're in the warehouse
at 14th and Roosevelt,

34:34.822 --> 34:37.241
the only one that had
surgical equipment delivered.

34:37.325 --> 34:39.702
Relay that to the tac team,
have them standing by.

34:45.583 --> 34:46.417
Hi.

34:47.293 --> 34:48.669
Let's see what you got.

35:06.604 --> 35:08.564
Aren't you a little spitfire?

35:09.482 --> 35:12.693
-I think you're forgetting something.
-What's that?

35:12.777 --> 35:13.694
Her hands.

35:26.749 --> 35:27.667
Knife down.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.462
-Back up.
-This is none of your concern.

35:31.546 --> 35:34.298
-You're here about the painting.
-I have the painting, yes.

35:34.382 --> 35:35.675
But that's not why I'm here.

35:35.758 --> 35:38.594
I'm here about this
game of hearts you're playing.

35:38.678 --> 35:41.848
-It's your turn to discard.
-You don't know what you're talking about.

35:41.931 --> 35:44.684
If you knew,
you would not call this a game.

35:45.309 --> 35:47.019
A psychopathology then.

35:48.187 --> 35:52.233
My guess would be that you had
something important taken from you.

35:52.316 --> 35:54.360
More important than anything else.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.737
So now you right wrongs

35:56.821 --> 36:00.324
and avenge others who have
had something taken from them.

36:00.408 --> 36:02.785
If you know that's what I'm doing,
why stop it?

36:03.494 --> 36:05.705
Order. Harmony.

36:06.497 --> 36:09.584
Balancing the scales so good is rewarded

36:09.667 --> 36:11.210
and evil is punished.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.045
Most of us want that.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.006
I know I certainly do.

36:15.089 --> 36:17.758
If that's what you were doing here,
I wouldn't interrupt.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.343
You know who this man is?

36:19.427 --> 36:22.388
Do you know what Huntley did to this man?

36:22.471 --> 36:23.890
Yes, it's abhorrent.

36:23.973 --> 36:26.058
I also know what else he's done.

36:26.142 --> 36:28.352
He as much as murdered this man.

36:28.436 --> 36:29.395
Perhaps.

36:29.896 --> 36:34.942
He also paid for a pediatric clinic
that's saving children's lives.

36:35.026 --> 36:40.281
He's contributed to research that has
eliminated deadly childhood diseases

36:40.364 --> 36:43.117
that have afflicted poor children
around the world.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.452
That man is no saint.

36:44.535 --> 36:46.662
No, he's not. He's a sinner.

36:47.163 --> 36:49.165
But you think that's all he is.

36:49.248 --> 36:51.876
In your binary world, that's all you see.

36:51.959 --> 36:53.586
So when you do your math,

36:53.669 --> 36:56.672
the answer you come to
is that he deserves to die.

36:57.173 --> 36:58.507
My math is different.

36:58.591 --> 37:01.719
You and everyone else taking the side
of the rich over the poor.

37:01.802 --> 37:05.514
-That's not what I'm doing.
-That is exactly what you are doing.

37:05.598 --> 37:09.227
By stopping this, William Green will die.

37:09.727 --> 37:12.271
The decent, honest steel worker

37:12.355 --> 37:17.109
will be sacrificed
for the rapacious hedge fund manager.

37:17.193 --> 37:19.862
Who said anything about letting him die?

37:20.947 --> 37:23.032
-What's his blood type?
-O negative.

37:23.115 --> 37:24.492
He needs a heart.

37:24.575 --> 37:27.370
And he's going to get one.
Just not Huntley's.

37:29.497 --> 37:31.290
What's your blood type?

37:31.832 --> 37:32.792
O negative.

37:32.875 --> 37:34.835
Ah! Boy, that's lucky.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.754
And you're about the same size.

37:36.837 --> 37:40.216
Not perfect, but this is
how my math works out.

37:44.011 --> 37:46.681
There is an avenging angel for all of us.

37:47.765 --> 37:50.184
This will not keep you from yours.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.144
I certainly hope not.

Get on the comms and tell Cooper.

38:12.665 --> 38:13.582
Tell him what?

38:13.666 --> 38:17.545
[Dembe] That Mr. Green is alive
and breathing with a new heart.

38:17.628 --> 38:20.256
But for Michael, we were too late.

38:23.217 --> 38:26.554
The blacklister is dead,
her heart transplanted to Green,

38:26.637 --> 38:28.764
but I suspect you know all of this.

38:28.848 --> 38:32.893
Sometimes, even an avenging angel
needs an avenging angel.

38:32.977 --> 38:34.937
You found the blacklister and killed her.

38:35.021 --> 38:36.439
<i>Why bring us the case?</i>

38:36.522 --> 38:39.734
If you're asking if I had
an angle to play, I didn't.

38:39.817 --> 38:42.069
<i>Until you told me about Derek Huntley.</i>

38:42.153 --> 38:43.654
How did that change the equation?

38:43.738 --> 38:46.407
It gave me the opportunity to make
a powerful acquaintance.

38:46.490 --> 38:49.160
You can't have too many
of those in your debt.

38:49.243 --> 38:51.787
What's the difference between
you and Michael?

38:51.871 --> 38:54.790
She fancied herself judge,
jury and executioner.

38:55.458 --> 38:56.792
How are you different?

38:56.876 --> 38:59.754
My goodness,
we couldn't be more different.

38:59.837 --> 39:02.715
She judged people
based on their worst day.

39:02.798 --> 39:05.885
<i>By the most terrible sin they committed.</i>

39:05.968 --> 39:08.304
-Shouldn't we be judged by that?
<i>-I don't think so.</i>

39:08.387 --> 39:11.724
If that were the standard,
we'd all be found wanting.

39:11.807 --> 39:15.895
By what standard should we be judged,
if not by the worst day of our life?

39:15.978 --> 39:17.730
By every other day.

39:17.813 --> 39:19.982
<i>We all have the devil in us, Harold.</i>

39:34.497 --> 39:37.541

39:45.257 --> 39:46.342
You made it.

39:46.425 --> 39:48.636
Are you kidding? I love death metal.

39:48.719 --> 39:51.555
I'm a total Cadaver Rising groupie.

39:53.015 --> 39:55.351
I must say, I'm something of a virgin.

Excited but a bit apprehensive.

[Ada] I do it to reach young people,
so they will never forget.

40:01.732 --> 40:02.775
My voice kept me alive.

Now I use it to remind the world
that good triumphs over evil.

40:06.487 --> 40:07.905

Right now all I care about
is that you're here.

-Alina.
-Did I pass?

No. You didn't.

41:01.542 --> 41:02.793
What are you talking about?

41:02.877 --> 41:06.380
The test came back negative.
I've been reinstated, but, um...

41:06.464 --> 41:07.798
But what?

41:07.882 --> 41:11.510
The hormonal levels in my readings,
they were irregular.

41:11.594 --> 41:15.264
It sometimes happens when someone
has abnormal tissues or...

41:16.223 --> 41:17.141
tumors.

41:17.224 --> 41:19.810
-The results indicate that--
-You may have cancer.

41:19.894 --> 41:22.646
Yeah. But since they actually
tested you and not me--

You don't owe me an apology.
It was a shock for both of us.
