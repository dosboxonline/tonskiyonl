WEBVTT

00:36.036 --> 00:38.203
- All right, you got the note?
- Yeah, right.

00:38.329 --> 00:41.957
Nice and tight.
Two, three, four.

01:13.239 --> 01:16.950
This is the Fordham section
of The Bronx... my home.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.869
A world unto itself.

01:18.995 --> 01:21.163
You can get to any borough
in 15 minutes from here,

01:21.289 --> 01:23.916
but they might as well be
3,000 miles away.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.836
That's Mount Carmel Church.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.881
And the sound of the bells
would fill the neighbourhood.

01:41.059 --> 01:44.937
It was 1960, and doo-wop
was the sound on the streets.

01:48.024 --> 01:51.985
It felt like there was a doo-wop
group on every corner back then.

01:54.864 --> 01:56.824
What a time it was!

01:58.368 --> 02:00.494
The New York Yankees were playing
the Pittsburgh Pirates

02:00.620 --> 02:02.037
in the World Series...

02:02.163 --> 02:04.623
and Mickey Mantle
was like a god to me.

02:04.749 --> 02:08.585
My dad would take me to Yankee Stadium
and we'd watch the Yankees win.

02:11.089 --> 02:14.633
That's the Chez Bippy -
that's where all the guys hung out.

02:14.759 --> 02:17.094
But I'll tell you about them later.

02:20.557 --> 02:23.684
That's my building.
I live right there on the third floor.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.520
667 East 187th Street.

02:29.357 --> 02:30.816
There's my stoop.

02:33.570 --> 02:36.655
And on warm summer nights
all through the neighbourhood...

02:36.781 --> 02:39.741
you would hear young Italian men
romancing their women.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.827
Hey, Marie!

02:41.953 --> 02:44.830
- Get in the fucking car!
- No!

02:44.956 --> 02:47.416
- Get in the car!
- Leave me alone.

02:47.542 --> 02:50.002
- Come on, baby, you know I love you.
- Yeah, bullshit.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.129
Will ya get in the fucking car!

03:02.432 --> 03:03.932
And right there,

03:04.058 --> 03:06.393
right there under that lamppost there,
stood the man -

03:06.519 --> 03:09.521
the number-one man
in the neighbourhood... Sonny.

03:10.523 --> 03:13.525
Everybody loved Sonny
and treated him like a god.

03:14.527 --> 03:18.488
And in my neighbourhood,
he was a god.

03:18.615 --> 03:22.075
And I would sit on my stoop
and watch him, all day and all night.

03:22.952 --> 03:25.287
But he would never even
look at me.

03:25.413 --> 03:28.165
Never, until one day.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.760
- What do you want?
- You got room in there for us?

03:39.886 --> 03:41.428
You wish!

05:34.125 --> 05:36.376
- Oh, shit!
- Let's go!

06:05.698 --> 06:07.324
That's my dad, Lorenzo Anello.

06:08.326 --> 06:12.913
His bus route was 187th Street.
I used to love to ride the bus with him.

06:13.581 --> 06:16.166
That's me, Calogero,
nine years old.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.939
- All right. See you later, Pop.
- OK.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.365
Go right upstairs, son.

06:49.367 --> 06:53.286
That's my mum, Rosina.
She met my dad at a dance.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.123
They fell in love
and they've been together ever since.

07:04.715 --> 07:07.676
You're always listening.
Take care of this fucking...

08:38.058 --> 08:40.268
Come on. Knock him out!

08:48.528 --> 08:51.488
The Chez Bippy.
This is where all the guys hung out.

08:51.614 --> 08:54.741
Get the fuck out of here!
Take a walk!

08:55.535 --> 08:58.453
Tony Toupee was owner of the bar
in name only.

08:58.579 --> 09:00.497
It was really Sonny's place.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.461
Tony was a frustrated singer
and everybody hated his voice.

09:06.587 --> 09:10.590
So just for spite, he'd never utter
a spoken word - he would only sing it.

09:10.716 --> 09:14.219
They called him Tony Toupee because
he wore the worst hairpiece in the world.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.686
Eddie Mush was a degenerate gambler
and the biggest loser in the world.

09:23.938 --> 09:26.523
They called him "Mush" because
everything he touched turned to mush.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.858
Never mind "Eddie my love",
I need a winner!

09:28.985 --> 09:32.320
At the race track, the teller would
give him his tickets already ripped up.

09:32.446 --> 09:34.406
I had the Yankees. They lost.

09:34.532 --> 09:38.118
If it wasn't for bad luck,
I wouldn't have no luck at all.

09:39.453 --> 09:41.288
JoJo the Whale.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.040
You didn't walk with JoJo,
you walked among him.

09:44.166 --> 09:47.294
If you stared at JoJo long enough,
you'd see him get fatter by the hour.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.339
Legend has it his shadow
once killed a dog.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.927
They called him
Frankie Coffeecake...

09:56.053 --> 09:59.347
because his face looked like
a Drake's Coffeecake.

09:59.473 --> 10:02.142
He was tough to look at.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.032
Hey, kid, how you doin'?

10:18.534 --> 10:21.453
His name was Jimmy Whispers
and he was Sonny's main man.

10:22.496 --> 10:25.582
They called him "Whispers" because
everything was a secret to him.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.048
Danny K.O. Knocked guys out...

10:33.174 --> 10:36.009
and Bobby Bars
spent half his life behind them.

10:36.135 --> 10:40.013
This was Sonny's crew,
and nobody fucked with these guys.

10:41.098 --> 10:45.935
What are ya doin' here?
Didn't we tell you not to come here?

10:46.062 --> 10:49.439
Didn't I tell ya not to come upstairs!
Wait till I tell your father!

10:49.565 --> 10:53.193
- What were you doing here?
- I was looking for Daddy.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.611
Well that's very nice!

10:56.405 --> 10:58.448
I have to get somethin' in the store.
Don't move!

10:58.574 --> 11:01.326
You wait right here! You hear me?

11:03.454 --> 11:08.124
Every time I saw Sonny, I'd try to imitate
him, but he'd never even look at me.

11:13.130 --> 11:15.256
Sonny had five fingers...

11:15.383 --> 11:17.425
but he only used three.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.138
Come on. Let's go.
Move. Upstairs.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.690
I'm not in the mood for steak.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.025
Oh, you're not?

11:34.151 --> 11:36.861
How many times do I have to drive
that bus back and forth...

11:36.987 --> 11:38.905
so this family can eat steak
once a week?

11:39.031 --> 11:40.699
- Seven.
- Who told you that?

11:40.825 --> 11:42.033
Nobody. I counted.

11:42.159 --> 11:44.202
Calogero, your father wants
to talk to you.

11:44.328 --> 11:47.914
- About what, Dad?
- Mum caught you by the bar today.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.333
- I wasn't.
- Tell your father the truth!

11:50.459 --> 11:52.919
- I was by the bar.
- So why'd you lie?

11:53.045 --> 11:55.171
- I took a shot.
- Wanna do something here?

11:55.297 --> 11:57.340
What am I gonna say?
Nice try, son.

11:57.466 --> 11:59.968
- Thanks, Dad.
- Lorenzo, come on, please!

12:00.094 --> 12:02.345
How can I keep him away?
It's two doors away.

12:02.471 --> 12:04.556
Daddy's right.
You should listen to him.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.433
Shut up.
Nobody's talking to you.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.476
Give me your plate.

12:09.145 --> 12:12.689
I want you to listen to me.
Hey! Do not go near the bar.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.984
Stay on the stoop,
but keep away from the bar.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.945
- When you're older, you'll understand.
- Yes.

12:19.071 --> 12:23.158
- You don't see me going there.
- Mum won't let you go there either?

12:23.284 --> 12:26.369
- What am I going to do?
- I don't know. I got him all day.

12:26.495 --> 12:29.164
I'm just kidding.
I'll won't go near the bar.

12:33.586 --> 12:37.255
Look what I got. Two tickets,
Yankee Stadium, centre field.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.507
- Behind the Mick?
- Right behind number seven.

12:39.633 --> 12:42.343
- Now eat your steak.
- Yeah!

12:46.515 --> 12:48.475
Let's go, Alfie.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.894
That's Phil the Peddler.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.062
He would call everybody "Mary."

12:53.189 --> 12:56.107
Me and my friends would
love to break his balls.

12:58.527 --> 13:01.321
Slick and Crazy Mario
were my best friends.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.990
Slick got his name
because of his hair.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.743
Mario got his
because he was just crazy.

13:09.038 --> 13:12.665
I'll kick your little fucking asses,
you bunch of Marys.

13:14.376 --> 13:17.504
Stay away from the fruit!
Keep your hands off the fruit!

13:17.630 --> 13:19.172
You fucking Marys!

13:19.298 --> 13:22.425
I'll kick you loose, you Marys!
The three of you!

13:22.551 --> 13:26.262
I'll kick your fucking asses,
you fucking ball breakers!

13:26.388 --> 13:31.059
Keep your hands off the vegetables!
What do you think this is?

13:31.185 --> 13:34.270
Wait! Go make your mother
and father feed you!

13:34.396 --> 13:38.274
I'll give you the heave-ho,
you fucking ball breakers!

13:39.527 --> 13:41.110
- How many did you get?
- I got one.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.071
...stop borrowing money!

13:43.197 --> 13:45.573
Oh, boy -
Coffeecake's in trouble again!

13:47.159 --> 13:49.035
Somebody's gonna get their ass kicked.

13:49.161 --> 13:52.330
Guys, check it out.
Mario, who's this?

14:00.422 --> 14:03.591
That's Jimmy Whispers.

14:03.717 --> 14:07.220
You'd better talk to him again.
You're responsible for him.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.305
Whoa! Come on, wait a minute.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.563
It's Sonny.

14:17.481 --> 14:21.025
You do somebody now,
big mouth.

14:21.151 --> 14:23.278
Do somebody hard,
like Coffeecake.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.447
- I can't do Coffeecake!
- That's hard.

14:26.574 --> 14:30.201
Put a screen in front of your
face while I throw shit at it.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.413
Oh, shit.

14:34.623 --> 14:37.500
These niggers got some balls,
coming in our neighbourhood.

14:37.626 --> 14:40.169
They don't live here,
they just pass through from school.

14:40.296 --> 14:43.047
- How the fuck do you know?
- My father told me.

14:43.173 --> 14:46.342
My father told me
that's how it starts.

14:47.428 --> 14:50.930
Get the fuck out of our neighbourhood,
you fucking niggers!

14:51.056 --> 14:53.141
Go back to Australia
where you came from!

14:53.267 --> 14:55.977
You're lucky
you're on that bus!

14:56.103 --> 14:58.313
Ha ha, you missed me!

14:58.439 --> 15:00.273
Stay out of our neighbourhood!

15:06.447 --> 15:07.697
Why?

15:20.294 --> 15:24.005
You don't fucking stop.
Get the fuck out of here!

15:24.131 --> 15:26.591
Nobody's cooler than you, Sonny.

15:30.429 --> 15:33.056
What the fuck is wrong with you?
What you doin'?

15:33.182 --> 15:35.850
- Fuck you, you freehole!
- Fuck you, you scumbag!

15:35.976 --> 15:38.853
You're a real motherfucker!
I'll bust your fucking head!

15:41.023 --> 15:43.024
I'm gonna bust your fucking head!

15:51.700 --> 15:53.284
Hold on here.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.287
Sonny, give me the gun!

15:56.413 --> 15:58.331
- Get the fucking car!
- Move the fucking car!

16:00.876 --> 16:02.251
Come on!

16:11.845 --> 16:14.973
When Sonny looked at me
for the first time, I went deaf.

16:15.099 --> 16:16.683
I couldn't hear.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.644
All I could see was Sonny
with the gun in his hand.

16:45.587 --> 16:46.838
What happened?
Is he all right?

16:46.964 --> 16:48.715
Dad, it was just
a parking space.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.092
- You don't understand.
- Is he all right?

16:51.218 --> 16:53.302
- Baby, are you OK?
- He's all right. Let's go inside.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.596
- What happened?
- I'm OK, Mum, I'm OK.

16:55.723 --> 16:58.683
- Oh, my god, I got so scared.
- I'm OK, Mum.

17:01.895 --> 17:05.064
You don't understand, Dad.
They were fighting over a parking space.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.650
- Over a parking space?
- Over a parking space, Daddy. Why?

17:07.776 --> 17:10.194
It wasn't over a parking space.
They just met at the wrong time.

17:10.319 --> 17:12.488
- What kind of answer is that?
- Just leave it alone.

17:12.614 --> 17:14.949
Let's mind our own business.
He's OK. That's the main thing.

17:15.075 --> 17:18.327
I can't believe somebody would do this.

17:20.748 --> 17:21.914
Who is it?

17:22.040 --> 17:24.250
Police. Is this
the Anello residence?

17:26.502 --> 17:27.962
Yeah. Can I help you?

17:28.088 --> 17:30.673
We're detectives.
We'd like to ask you some questions.

17:31.508 --> 17:34.635
- About what?
- Just open the door!

17:40.476 --> 17:41.768
How you doing? OK, good.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.479
I'm Detective Belsik.
This is my partner, Detective Vella.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.064
Hello, son. How you doing, ma'am?

17:47.232 --> 17:49.901
- We'd like to ask your son a few questions.
- About what?

17:50.027 --> 17:52.945
There was a shooting in front of the building,
and we believe your son was there.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.531
Really? Well, he knows
nothing about that.

17:55.657 --> 17:57.492
Well, we feel he does.
There were people who saw him.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.494
Well, they're wrong.
He don't know nothing.

17:59.620 --> 18:03.456
Listen, Mr Anello. We can do things
the nice way or the hard way, all right?

18:03.582 --> 18:05.792
I don't care what way you do it.
He don't know nothing.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.044
Daddy, I know everything.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.883
Kids. Sometimes they
make believe they see things.

18:14.009 --> 18:15.551
We didn't pick your name out of a hat.

18:15.677 --> 18:18.679
We know your son was down there.
So, come on, let's go.

18:20.140 --> 18:23.226
Son, listen. Here's what
I'd like you to do for us.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.937
I'd like you to take a walk downstairs
with us and your father.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.688
We have people down there.

18:27.815 --> 18:31.567
All I want you to do is pick out
the person you saw with the gun in his hand.

18:31.693 --> 18:34.570
That's it. You think
you could do that for us?

18:46.834 --> 18:49.001
Good. Come on.
Let's take a walk.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.003
Mr. Anello,
take a walk downstairs.

18:53.006 --> 18:55.383
- We won't be long. Go ahead.
- Officer, is he gonna be OK?

18:55.509 --> 18:58.344
Everything's gonna be fine, dear.
They'll be back in two minutes.

19:21.368 --> 19:22.577
There's Lorenzo.

19:55.068 --> 19:56.777
Hey, fellas, turn around.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.365
You two, take your hats off.

20:02.492 --> 20:06.495
Hey! Put your head up.
Straight ahead. Look this way.

20:07.164 --> 20:09.415
- Is that him?
- No.

20:16.089 --> 20:19.342
How about this guy?
Straight ahead, fella.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.969
- How about him?
- No.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.764
Straight ahead, you.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.599
How about this guy?

20:28.268 --> 20:29.685
Give me an answer.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.646
- How about him?
- No.

20:35.859 --> 20:38.277
How about him?
Is it this guy?

20:40.822 --> 20:42.573
Give me an answer.

20:47.496 --> 20:49.664
Hey! Put your eyes up!

20:50.749 --> 20:52.458
How about this guy?

20:57.965 --> 21:00.800
Let's go. Hey, look
straight ahead! Over here.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.221
Look at me. That's it.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.931
Is it this guy?

21:08.725 --> 21:11.143
- How about this guy?
- No.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.478
OK.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.983
Look at this guy.
How about him?

21:18.610 --> 21:21.153
Hey! Straight ahead.

21:22.197 --> 21:25.283
How about this guy?
Is it him?

21:41.258 --> 21:43.384
Give me an answer.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.470
No.

21:46.596 --> 21:48.389
- You satisfied, Officer?
- No, I'm not satisfied.

21:48.515 --> 21:51.267
- He don't know. He can't help you.
- Yeah, yeah, your son doesn't know anything.

21:51.393 --> 21:53.978
- He said no, he can't help you.
- I'll tell you what. Take a walk.

21:54.104 --> 21:57.273
- Go ahead. Go ahead. Take a walk.
- Come on, son. Let's go.

22:03.322 --> 22:06.782
All right, you guys can breathe again.
Beat it. Get out of my sight.

22:11.121 --> 22:14.332
- We really fooled them, Dad.
- Yeah, we fooled them.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.543
I didn't rat, Dad, I didn't rat.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.378
No, you didn't rat.

22:20.255 --> 22:22.089
I did a good thing, right?

22:22.215 --> 22:25.718
Yeah, you did a good thing -
you did a good thing for a bad man.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.930
I did a good thing for a bad man.

22:30.057 --> 22:32.600
I didn't understand that,
not at nine years old.

22:33.727 --> 22:35.353
All I knew was...

22:35.479 --> 22:38.272
a rat was the lowest thing anyone
could be in my neighbourhood...

22:38.398 --> 22:39.690
and I didn't rat.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.876
Daddy, why did you say
I did a good thing for a bad man?

23:00.837 --> 23:04.006
Because sometimes in life you gotta do
certain things that you gotta do,

23:04.132 --> 23:05.383
even though they're not right.

23:07.177 --> 23:08.969
Do you understand what I'm saying?

23:09.930 --> 23:13.933
No. It's just that I thought
I did the right thing.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.601
Now I'm not sure I did.

23:15.727 --> 23:19.105
You did do the right thing,
and when you get older, you'll understand why.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.232
Your mother and I
love you very, very much.

23:27.155 --> 23:29.824
Tomorrow you take a ride
on the bus with me. OK?

23:33.537 --> 23:36.831
City Island was the last stop
on my father's route.

23:36.957 --> 23:39.500
It was one of our
favourite places.

23:39.626 --> 23:42.002
It was like going
on a vacation for a day.

23:42.671 --> 23:46.424
My dad would listen to his jazz
and we would talk about baseball.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.847
Dad, can I have an ice cream?

23:53.682 --> 23:56.267
We do our job first,
and then I'll get you an ice cream.

23:56.393 --> 23:58.269
- OK?
- OK, Pop.

24:00.856 --> 24:02.273
Here.

24:03.525 --> 24:06.986
- Let's play the game, Dad.
- OK, let's see how good you are today.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.113
Who was the last player
to win the Triple Crown?

24:09.239 --> 24:12.616
Mickey Mantle.
Batting average, 353.

24:12.742 --> 24:14.952
RBls, 130.

24:15.078 --> 24:16.996
Home runs, 52.

24:17.622 --> 24:20.583
- That's pretty good, son.
- The best ballplayer that ever lived, Dad.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.918
Joe D's the greatest ballplayer.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.463
The Yankee Clipper.

24:25.589 --> 24:27.798
- 56-game hitting streak.
- That's right.

24:27.924 --> 24:31.010
- Nobody beat that. Right, Dad?
- Nobody beat that, son.

24:32.262 --> 24:35.264
- Do you know why Joe D. Was so great?
- Because he was Italian?

24:35.390 --> 24:38.184
- Well, that's part of it.
- Then why?

24:38.310 --> 24:40.269
Because he had
more talent than anybody.

24:40.395 --> 24:42.229
- Talent?
- That's right.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.024
Do I have talent, Dad?

24:45.150 --> 24:47.943
Of course you have talent.
You got all the talent in the world.

24:48.069 --> 24:49.653
Can I be a ballplayer?

24:50.489 --> 24:51.947
You can be anything
you want to be.

24:52.949 --> 24:55.659
Remember, the saddest thing in life
is wasted talent.

24:55.785 --> 24:57.620
You could have all the talent in the world,

24:57.746 --> 25:00.039
but if you don't do the right thing,
then nothing happens.

25:00.165 --> 25:02.875
But when you do right,
guess what, good things happen.

25:03.001 --> 25:05.628
- You hear me?
- You're right.

25:05.754 --> 25:08.088
- Let's go for that ice cream.
- Yeah, good.

25:09.716 --> 25:12.384
- I'm gonna shut the doors, right, Dad?
- Yeah.

25:15.889 --> 25:17.640
Ready? Watch it.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.810
- Got it?
- I got it.

25:23.730 --> 25:25.523
Wasted talent.

25:25.649 --> 25:28.776
That was something
my father would talk about all my life.

25:29.694 --> 25:32.112
Come on, let's hurry,
so we can catch the start of the game.

25:32.239 --> 25:37.868
'36,683 here to see
the final game of the '60 Series.

25:37.994 --> 25:40.246
'And what a ball game
they're looking at.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.707
'Moose Skowron, with that
infield hit deep to third...

25:43.833 --> 25:47.503
'has picked up his twelfth
World Series base hit in 1960.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.260
'Time called. Blanchard back... '

25:57.764 --> 25:59.265
Come on, Sonny.

26:03.853 --> 26:06.814
'One out, unassisted,
to Nelson, to end the sixth.

26:07.691 --> 26:09.358
'Southpaw hitter.

26:09.484 --> 26:12.528
'And Elroy Face 'staring down
to his battery mate Hal Smith.

26:13.530 --> 26:16.240
'Into the stretch now.
The little man sets.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.158
'And here's the first one
coming to Blanchard.

26:18.285 --> 26:19.827
'Outside and a ball.'

26:24.082 --> 26:26.250
- See you later, Pop.
- OK.

26:33.466 --> 26:36.760
Get right upstairs, and watch the rest
of the game. No hanging out, son.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.896
Hey, Lorenzo, how you doing?

26:48.023 --> 26:50.357
Keep driving.
I want to talk to you.

26:52.277 --> 26:55.738
- Your kid is a good kid.
- Thanks.

26:55.864 --> 26:58.240
Sonny really appreciates
what you and your son did for him.

26:58.366 --> 27:01.201
That's all right.
I'm just glad everything worked out.

27:01.328 --> 27:02.494
He'd like to do something for you.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.705
All you gotta do is
drop some numbers off for us.

27:04.831 --> 27:06.290
You're gonna get $150 a week.

27:06.416 --> 27:08.167
Won't even have to get off the bus.

27:08.293 --> 27:12.004
Tell him I appreciate it, but I got a city job.
If I get pinched I could lose it.

27:12.130 --> 27:15.674
- At least think about it.
- I just can't do it. It's not for me.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.718
$150 a week. You don't
want to think about it?

27:17.844 --> 27:20.763
I can't do this. It's not for me.
I can't do it.

27:20.889 --> 27:24.141
Sonny's gonna be disappointed,
but I'm gonna tell him what you said.

27:24.267 --> 27:25.434
OK.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.978
Stop the bus here.
I want to get off.

27:46.623 --> 27:48.874
- They offered me a job today.
- Doing what?

27:49.000 --> 27:50.292
Numbers.

27:50.418 --> 27:52.920
All I gotta do is pick up a piece of paper
and drop it off on my round

27:53.046 --> 27:54.672
and they said they'll give me
$150 a week.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.882
$150 a week? What did you say?

27:57.008 --> 28:00.803
What do you think I said?
I told him to forget it. It's not for me.

28:05.433 --> 28:06.725
What?

28:07.852 --> 28:11.814
I don't know. $150?
It's only numbers.

28:11.940 --> 28:15.067
- You think I should've took it?
- I don't know.

28:16.403 --> 28:17.736
Yeah, but, come on,
you know...

28:17.862 --> 28:21.490
You get involved with those guys,
next thing, you know, one, two three...

28:21.616 --> 28:23.200
I don't know...

28:28.456 --> 28:29.581
I don't like the way you look.

28:31.626 --> 28:32.876
Maybe you're right.

28:34.295 --> 28:37.047
- I'm going to check on the baby.
- Come here.

28:37.882 --> 28:39.633
- What?
- Come here.

28:41.594 --> 28:44.638
You're not sorry you got stuck
with a bus driver, are you?

28:45.348 --> 28:47.933
- I fell in love with your uniform.
- Yeah.

28:57.235 --> 29:00.237
The day of the funeral,
I felt really bad.

29:00.363 --> 29:04.908
I realised that a man had died,
and I had lied and committed a mortal sin.

29:05.034 --> 29:06.660
And I wanted God to forgive me.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.715
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

29:19.841 --> 29:22.676
It has been one month
since my last confession,

29:22.802 --> 29:26.472
and these are my sins:
I missed mass on Sunday twice,

29:26.598 --> 29:30.184
I lied about witnessing a murder once,
I ate meat on Friday once.

29:30.310 --> 29:33.187
Wait a minute. Can you back up
a little bit and say that again?

29:34.314 --> 29:35.773
I ate meat on Friday once?

29:35.899 --> 29:38.275
Not that one.
Back up a little more.

29:39.110 --> 29:41.653
- I lied about witnessing a murder?
- Yeah, that's the one.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.198
Do you realise what you said?

29:44.324 --> 29:46.074
It was only once, Father.

29:46.785 --> 29:50.454
- Do you know what the fifth is?
- Yes, Father, I know what the fifth is.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.790
The fifth is, "I refuse to answer
on the grounds that I might incrimin..."

29:52.916 --> 29:54.374
The Fifth Commandment!

29:55.502 --> 29:56.835
"Thou shall not kill."

29:58.421 --> 30:02.549
That's right. Now, I want you to tell me
what happened.

30:02.675 --> 30:05.177
No, Father,
I'm not telling nobody nothing.

30:05.303 --> 30:08.722
Don't be afraid, my son.
Nobody's more powerful than God.

30:08.848 --> 30:11.141
I don't know about that, Father.

30:11.267 --> 30:13.477
Your guy's bigger
than my guy up there,

30:13.603 --> 30:15.771
but my guy's bigger
than your guy down here.

30:18.858 --> 30:22.945
You got a point. Five Our Fathers
and five Hail Marys for your penance.

30:23.071 --> 30:25.364
For a murder rap?
That's not bad, Father.

30:25.490 --> 30:28.158
- What did you say?
- Bye, Father!

30:28.284 --> 30:31.245
It was great to be Catholic
and go to confession.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.539
You could start over
every week.

30:44.467 --> 30:46.051
Hey, kid!

30:49.472 --> 30:53.433
Come on, Sonny wants to see you.
Nobody's going to grab that bike.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.987
They're good kids.
They just did a piece of work for me.

31:05.113 --> 31:06.989
- Put them in.
- It's up to you, Sonny.

31:08.616 --> 31:11.660
Here's the kid, Sonny.
Go ahead. Don't be afraid.

31:23.131 --> 31:25.007
How you doing, kid?

31:26.050 --> 31:27.467
Good.

31:29.512 --> 31:31.722
We finally meet face-to-face.

31:36.144 --> 31:37.269
Are you afraid of me?

31:38.813 --> 31:40.105
- No.
- That's good.

31:41.441 --> 31:42.566
What's your name?

31:43.401 --> 31:45.360
Calogero.

31:45.486 --> 31:48.530
That's a big name.
You got a nickname or something?

31:48.656 --> 31:50.073
No.

31:51.409 --> 31:54.703
- What do your friends call you?
- Calogero.

31:54.829 --> 31:56.413
That makes sense.

31:57.624 --> 32:00.208
- What are you, a Yankee fan?
- Yeah.

32:02.629 --> 32:03.962
Sit down.

32:06.007 --> 32:07.966
Now, come over here.
Sit over here, next to me.

32:08.092 --> 32:09.635
Come here.

32:14.766 --> 32:18.060
So, you must be pretty upset
after the Yankees lost.

32:18.186 --> 32:21.438
Bill Mazeroski, I hate him.

32:21.564 --> 32:23.690
He made Mickey Mantle cry.

32:23.816 --> 32:25.442
The papers said
that Mick was crying.

32:25.568 --> 32:28.320
Mickey Mantle?
Is that what you're upset about?

32:28.446 --> 32:31.698
Mantle makes $100,000 a year.
How much does your father make?

32:31.824 --> 32:32.908
I don't know.

32:33.034 --> 32:36.119
You don't know? Well, see,
if your father can't pay the rent,

32:36.245 --> 32:37.955
go ask Mickey Mantle,
see what he tells you.

32:38.081 --> 32:40.916
Mickey Mantle don't care about you,
so why should you care about him?

32:41.042 --> 32:42.626
Nobody cares.

32:45.254 --> 32:48.340
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

32:49.550 --> 32:51.426
Did you shoot that man
over a parking space?

32:57.392 --> 32:59.685
When you get older,
you'll understand.

33:04.190 --> 33:06.149
From that day on,

33:06.275 --> 33:09.319
I never felt the same
about the Yankees again.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.967
I started spending a lot
of time with Sonny.

33:33.594 --> 33:36.471
I would come home from school
and sneak away any chance I got.

33:37.598 --> 33:40.142
I would serve the guys drinks and coffee,
and they would give me tips.

33:40.268 --> 33:43.020
- Bet!
- I'll lay a hundred.

33:50.236 --> 33:51.236
Come on, Sonny!

33:52.739 --> 33:54.531
- Son of a bitch!
- I don't believe it!

33:54.657 --> 33:56.324
I should fucking break his arm.

33:57.285 --> 33:59.411
Here, kid, this is for you.

33:59.537 --> 34:03.707
- Sonny, loan me a hundred.
- You know what's gonna happen!

34:03.833 --> 34:06.001
- I feel it! Please!
- Give him a hundred.

34:06.127 --> 34:09.545
- I'm in, I'm in!
- Go ahead. Give him the dice.

34:09.672 --> 34:11.172
- Give him the dice.
- I'm in, I'm in!

34:11.299 --> 34:14.134
- It's fucking hot.
- Come on, Mush, make a donation.

34:14.260 --> 34:17.804
- Come on, Mush, get this over with.
- Come on, dice.

34:17.929 --> 34:21.725
Baby needs a new pair of shoes.
Come on, seven!

34:23.018 --> 34:26.480
Come on, dice!
And there's a seven!

34:26.606 --> 34:27.688
I don't even have to look.

34:27.815 --> 34:30.900
- Craps! I'm out!
- Get out of here.

34:32.527 --> 34:36.447
- Get him out of here!
- Man never hit a number in his life!

34:38.284 --> 34:41.078
- Bring the dice up here.
- Where's the kid?

34:42.163 --> 34:45.331
Sonny, do me a favour,
put this coffee on my tab?

34:45.458 --> 34:47.501
Get the fuck out of here.
Where's the kid?

34:48.335 --> 34:50.629
I'll tell you what.
The kid's gonna throw the dice for me.

34:50.755 --> 34:53.507
Sonny, don't let this kid
throw the dice!

34:54.217 --> 34:58.136
- Anybody got a problem with that?
- It's all right. No problem.

35:00.389 --> 35:02.015
I want you to throw the dice for me.

35:02.141 --> 35:05.018
- I don't know how to play dice, Sonny.
- It's OK. You don't have to know.

35:05.144 --> 35:07.729
- You just listen to me. Hear what I said?
- OK.

35:08.564 --> 35:10.565
I'll tell you what.
Put $500 down on the kid.

35:10.691 --> 35:12.400
I got a hundred!

35:19.325 --> 35:20.617
Hey!

35:20.743 --> 35:23.078
Stop fucking
leaning on me, please? Huh?

35:23.204 --> 35:25.122
Come on, you're breathing
all over me, all right?

35:25.248 --> 35:26.706
Hey, JoJo, relax!

35:26.833 --> 35:29.000
I'm trying to get a bet in.
I wanna play too, you know!

35:29.127 --> 35:30.877
I know you can do it.
You got to hit the wall, kid.

35:31.003 --> 35:33.296
Come on, you can do it.
Hit the wall.

35:33.422 --> 35:36.049
- You can do it.
- Wait, wait, wait...

35:36.175 --> 35:38.343
Wait, wait, wait,
I'm betting on Sonny.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.595
Hey! I don't want your money
touching my money.

35:40.721 --> 35:43.181
- What's the matter, it's counterfeit?
- I don't want your money in the same...

35:43.307 --> 35:45.058
My money's no good no more? Why?

35:45.184 --> 35:47.978
Why? Cos you're a fucking jinx,
that's why!

35:48.104 --> 35:50.397
Put him in the fucking bathroom!

35:50.523 --> 35:52.149
Get him out of here!

35:52.733 --> 35:57.070
Fucking get in there,
you fucking loser mutt!

35:57.196 --> 35:58.655
Leave him in there!

36:00.908 --> 36:02.367
- A fucking jinx!
- Shoot the dice.

36:03.744 --> 36:05.412
That's a lot of money on you.
Come on.

36:05.538 --> 36:09.082
- Roll a seven. Come on.
- Shoot the fucking dice. Hit the wall.

36:10.459 --> 36:12.419
Seven!

36:16.090 --> 36:18.675
Bring the dice up.
Put $1,000 on seven.

36:26.642 --> 36:29.311
You can do it, all right?
You can do it. You...

36:29.437 --> 36:32.647
Giorgio, stop fucking breathing on me!
You're killing me over here!

36:32.773 --> 36:35.650
I'm on a win streak.
Stop breathing on me!

36:35.776 --> 36:38.653
- Bobby, put him in the bathroom.
- Sonny, Eddie's in there. He ain't gonna fit.

36:38.779 --> 36:40.739
I don't give a fuck!
Put him in!

36:52.084 --> 36:53.710
Give me a another seven.

36:54.545 --> 36:56.463
Shoot the fucking dice!
Come on!

36:58.132 --> 37:01.384
We got a four! That's all right.

37:01.510 --> 37:02.969
Four's what we got.

37:03.095 --> 37:06.848
- Let's go! Shoot the dice!
- Give the kid another shot!

37:06.974 --> 37:09.517
What's wrong with this money?
What, is he crazy?

37:09.644 --> 37:10.852
What is it, counterfeit?

37:12.521 --> 37:15.357
I say the kid makes the four.
Give me $500.

37:15.483 --> 37:16.816
$500 more. Get your bets down.

37:16.943 --> 37:21.154
- Twenty-two on the hard four.
- I'll lay a hundred.

37:21.280 --> 37:24.199
- Who wants a gag on the four?
- One-forty, no gag.

37:24.325 --> 37:25.659
One-forty, no gag. Put it down.

37:25.785 --> 37:28.870
- I say the kid makes the hard four.
- He'll never make the hard four, never.

37:28.996 --> 37:30.997
Come on. You can do it.

37:31.123 --> 37:34.209
- Don't worry, Sonny. I'll throw a seven.
- No, no seven!

37:34.335 --> 37:37.212
- Yeah! Hit a seven!
- Shut up! He ain't gonna throw no seven.

37:37.338 --> 37:38.755
Do you believe this kid?

37:38.881 --> 37:42.008
Hey, I don't want anybody
laughing at this kid, all right?

37:42.134 --> 37:43.802
Come on, no seven.
Sevens are not good now.

37:43.928 --> 37:45.845
- Hit the wall.
- Get a four. You can do it.

37:45.972 --> 37:48.139
You gotta make the point.
You can do it.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.391
No, no, no...

37:51.018 --> 37:52.769
Frankie Coffeecake, no good.

37:52.895 --> 37:55.647
I don't want his face looking
at that face when he's throwing my dice.

37:55.773 --> 37:59.484
No, no, no. Jimmy, get a towel
from the bar. Put it over his head.

37:59.610 --> 38:02.362
Come on, Sonny. I don't want a towel
over my head. It's embarrassing.

38:02.488 --> 38:04.864
Put him in the fucking bathroom.
Get him out of here.

38:04.991 --> 38:07.492
Wait a minute. I got money here!

38:08.452 --> 38:10.370
Get the fuck out of here!

38:10.496 --> 38:12.998
- Get him the fuck out!
- Put him in the bathroom.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.165
Get over here.

38:16.335 --> 38:20.380
- Rat bastard locked us in the bathroom.
- It's degrading. Very degrading.

38:20.506 --> 38:22.382
Come on, I need that point.
Listen to me!

38:22.508 --> 38:24.884
Listen to me.
See that money over there? Look.

38:25.011 --> 38:27.387
See that money?
Are we going to make this point?

38:27.513 --> 38:29.306
Come on. We're gonna
make this point. Attaboy!

38:29.432 --> 38:33.059
- Come on!
- I need a 2-2 on the hard four.

38:33.185 --> 38:35.562
Hey, don't get cocky, kid!

38:35.688 --> 38:36.980
- Just make the point.
- Fucking kid.

38:37.106 --> 38:39.524
Just make the point. Go ahead.
Come on.

38:41.444 --> 38:44.112
I don't fucking believe it!
He did it!

38:45.031 --> 38:47.907
Eleven. I made eleven
passes in a row.

38:50.661 --> 38:53.788
I don't know how much money
Sonny won, but it was a lot.

38:59.045 --> 39:01.588
He would always say
the working man was a sucker,

39:01.714 --> 39:03.590
and I was going
to the best school in the world,

39:03.716 --> 39:05.216
the University of Belmont Ave,

39:05.343 --> 39:06.968
and I was getting two educations:

39:07.094 --> 39:09.346
One from the street
and one from school.

39:09.472 --> 39:11.931
That way I'd be twice as smart
as everybody.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.697
Hey, kid.

39:27.823 --> 39:30.158
- You did good.
- Thanks.

39:30.284 --> 39:31.993
Here.

39:33.454 --> 39:34.662
That's it?

39:36.582 --> 39:37.791
Here.

39:39.418 --> 39:41.169
All right?

39:42.129 --> 39:45.131
- Go home. It's getting late.
- See you later, Sonny.

39:49.261 --> 39:50.470
Listen.

39:53.015 --> 39:54.974
We gotta do something
about your name.

39:56.477 --> 39:58.269
From now on,
your name is C.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.605
- C?
- That's right. C.

40:00.731 --> 40:02.315
Go home. Go ahead.

40:02.441 --> 40:04.025
So long, Sonny.

40:04.902 --> 40:08.530
Sonny took me everywhere and he
would always introduce me as his boy.

40:08.656 --> 40:11.366
And I noticed that strange things started
happening in the neighbourhood.

40:11.492 --> 40:15.620
Hey, Calogero, come on over.
I want to talk to you.

40:17.915 --> 40:20.041
My name is C.

40:20.167 --> 40:21.668
I mean C.

40:22.795 --> 40:26.089
- How are you today, my boy?
- Good.

40:26.215 --> 40:28.633
I got some nice peaches
for your mum.

40:28.759 --> 40:30.844
I don't have
any money on me, Phil.

40:30.970 --> 40:34.222
You don't need no money
with me, kid.

40:34.348 --> 40:37.434
Don't embarrass me
like that again.

40:38.477 --> 40:41.688
Just tell Sonny
that I took care of you.

40:42.481 --> 40:43.481
OK.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.319
That's when it hit me.

40:48.446 --> 40:52.240
It was because of Sonny
that everyone was treating me so nice.

40:52.366 --> 40:55.702
I liked it.
I liked it a lot.

41:00.458 --> 41:03.585
Mummy, mummy, look what I got.
Some peaches for...

41:03.711 --> 41:05.336
free.

41:14.638 --> 41:17.807
- What's this?
- What's what, Dad?

41:17.933 --> 41:19.350
Where did you get this?

41:19.477 --> 41:21.186
Your mother found this
behind your drawer.

41:21.979 --> 41:23.396
It's the money
that I've been saving, Dad.

41:23.522 --> 41:25.064
$600 you've been saving?

41:25.191 --> 41:27.484
What, you've become
a brain surgeon overnight, son?

41:27.610 --> 41:29.235
Tell your father
where you got the money.

41:29.361 --> 41:30.778
Dad, I worked for it.

41:30.905 --> 41:33.406
- Doing what?
- Things.

41:33.532 --> 41:35.617
"Things"? What do you mean, "things"?
What "things"?

41:35.743 --> 41:38.661
- Oh, things. You know, things.
- Hey!

41:38.787 --> 41:42.123
Don't lie to me. Just tell me the truth,
and I won't get upset.

41:42.875 --> 41:43.875
Promise?

41:44.001 --> 41:47.086
I'm your father.
Would I say it if I didn't mean it?

41:48.714 --> 41:50.715
I work the crap games,
and the guys gave me tips.

41:50.841 --> 41:53.551
- Crap games?
- What crap games?

41:53.677 --> 41:56.179
What crap games?
What tips?

41:56.305 --> 41:59.516
- What crap games?
- I thought you weren't gonna get upset, Dad.

41:59.642 --> 42:00.934
I lied. Now, tell me everything.

42:01.060 --> 42:04.270
- I work for Sonny, and he gave me tips.
- I knew it.

42:04.396 --> 42:07.815
Weren't you told a dozen times
not to go near that bar?

42:07.942 --> 42:09.901
- But Ma, I worked for it.
- Whaddya mean, you worked for it?

42:10.027 --> 42:12.237
- You're not supposed to be in that bar!
- I'm taking this money back.

42:12.363 --> 42:15.198
- I'm bringing it right back down to the bar.
- Let's just think about this for a minute.

42:15.324 --> 42:18.201
- What do you mean, "think about it"?
- We could use the money.

42:18.327 --> 42:19.994
It's not like
he had to do something bad.

42:20.120 --> 42:22.664
That's not the point.
You know where this money comes from.

42:22.790 --> 42:25.083
I don't want him
to have that kind of money!

42:25.209 --> 42:26.709
- Let's just think about this.
- That's it!

42:26.835 --> 42:29.170
- Come on.
- Wait a minute. Listen to me.

42:30.923 --> 42:35.218
Lorenzo, why do you got
to go down like this? Calm down!

42:35.344 --> 42:38.096
Lorenzo, please!

42:38.222 --> 42:39.722
I don't believe this!

42:58.409 --> 43:01.536
- Is Sonny around?
- Yeah, I think he's in the back.

43:12.756 --> 43:14.048
We can't accept that.

43:14.925 --> 43:17.051
I gave it to your son.
He worked for it.

43:17.177 --> 43:20.179
That's right. My son and I don't want
my son involved in what goes on here.

43:20.306 --> 43:22.140
Involved in what?
What are you talking about?

43:22.266 --> 43:25.184
Please, I'm not a stupid man, OK?
Please. I'm not stupid.

43:25.311 --> 43:27.854
You know what I'm talking about.
Just stay away from my son, OK?

43:27.980 --> 43:29.522
Hey, you stay right over here.

43:29.648 --> 43:31.858
C, why don't you go outside.
I wanna talk to your father.

43:31.984 --> 43:35.361
I'll speak to my own son.
Calogero, wait outside.

43:37.698 --> 43:40.366
First of all, I respect you, Lorenzo.
You're a stand-up guy.

43:40.492 --> 43:43.202
We're from the same neighbourhood,
but don't ever talk to me like that again.

43:43.912 --> 43:46.039
I tell your son to go to school,
to go to college...

43:46.165 --> 43:48.041
It's not what you say,
it's what he sees.

43:48.167 --> 43:51.377
It's the clothes, it's the cars,
it's the money, it's everything.

43:51.503 --> 43:53.463
He tried to throw away
his baseball cards the other day

43:53.589 --> 43:56.007
because Mickey Mantle
would never pay my rent.

43:56.133 --> 43:58.635
He said that to you?
I don't believe this kid.

43:58.761 --> 44:03.014
It's not funny when your nine-year-old kid
has a bigger bank account than you do.

44:03.140 --> 44:05.224
I offered you a job,
but you said no to me.

44:05.351 --> 44:08.645
That's right. And I say no now.
Just leave my son alone. Please.

44:09.813 --> 44:12.357
Don't you see how I treat that kid?
I treat him like he's my son.

44:12.483 --> 44:15.652
- He ain't your son. He's my son!
- He's what?

44:15.778 --> 44:17.779
- Get the fuck out of here!
- I'm not afraid of you.

44:17.905 --> 44:20.365
- You should be.
- I know what you're capable of.

44:20.491 --> 44:23.534
And I would never step out of line.
You can ask anybody who knows me.

44:23.661 --> 44:26.996
But this time you're wrong.
This is my son, not yours!

44:27.122 --> 44:28.956
- Are you gonna fight me?
- Stay away from my son!

44:29.083 --> 44:30.875
Get out of here
before I give you a fucking slap!

44:31.001 --> 44:33.544
Just stay away from my son!

44:33.671 --> 44:36.589
I don't care who you are,
you stay away from my son.

44:36.715 --> 44:38.424
- Where's my money, Dad?
- I left it in there.

44:38.550 --> 44:41.010
What? How could you do that, Dad?
It was my money!

44:41.136 --> 44:43.721
That's bad money!
I don't want you to have that money.

44:43.847 --> 44:46.808
- Dad, I earned that money!
- I said I want you to stay away from him!

44:46.934 --> 44:49.394
- Dad, please listen to me!
- I said you stay away from him!

44:49.520 --> 44:53.064
- Dad, listen to me!
- Did you hear what I said? Stay away!

44:53.774 --> 44:57.068
Sonny was right.
The working man is a sucker.

44:57.194 --> 44:59.612
He's wrong! It don't
take much strength to pull a trigger,

44:59.738 --> 45:02.365
but try and get up every morning
and work for a living!

45:02.491 --> 45:05.243
Let's see him try that!
Then we'll see who's the real tough guy.

45:05.369 --> 45:06.786
The working man is the tough guy.

45:06.912 --> 45:09.163
Your father's the tough guy!

45:09.289 --> 45:12.166
Everybody loves him, just like
everybody loves you on the bus.

45:12.292 --> 45:15.878
It's not the same. People don't love him.
They fear him.

45:16.004 --> 45:18.131
There's a difference.

45:20.300 --> 45:22.135
- I'm sorry I hit you.
- I don't understand, Dad.

45:24.054 --> 45:26.347
You will.
You will when you get older.

45:27.725 --> 45:29.642
I'm sorry I hit you.

45:54.084 --> 45:57.670
- You want me to take care of him?
- No, leave him alone.

45:59.631 --> 46:02.884
Sonny and my father never
spoke to each other again.

46:03.010 --> 46:06.304
And I never listened to my father
about staying away from him.

46:06.430 --> 46:10.224
The bar was so close,
and I would sneak away any chance I got.

46:10.350 --> 46:14.854
Eight years passed, and as I grew,
Sonny grew in power.

46:14.980 --> 46:18.149
He became a boss,
and I was his friend.

46:33.207 --> 46:35.291
It was now 1968.

46:35.542 --> 46:37.418
Dion was on top of the charts.

46:37.544 --> 46:39.754
The Beatles were changing
the way we lived.

46:39.880 --> 46:43.174
The Yankees were in last place
and I didn't give a shit.

46:43.300 --> 46:47.428
There was change everywhere,
but my neighbourhood was still the same.

46:48.472 --> 46:49.555
'And they're off!

46:49.681 --> 46:52.183
'Expectedly Kryptonite
comes first from the gate!

46:52.309 --> 46:53.643
'On the outside comes... '

46:53.769 --> 46:55.770
Here comes the kid!
We didn't get shut out.

46:56.438 --> 46:59.565
- C, come here! You get it in?
- Yeah, I got it in. It's all on Kryptonite.

47:00.609 --> 47:03.528
- You hold them.
- Look at this horse go.

47:03.654 --> 47:05.822
- Come on. Take it home!
- Look at this one move!

47:06.824 --> 47:10.034
- This horse can't lose!
- You can do it, Kryptonite! Come on!

47:10.160 --> 47:13.871
Look, it's a lock. It's beautiful.
Don't even worry about it. We can't lose.

47:13.997 --> 47:16.123
I'm not even going to look
because I know we can't lose.

47:16.250 --> 47:17.959
- We can't lose.
- Let's go. Come on!

47:19.127 --> 47:21.337
- Look! He's pulling away!
- Come on, Kryptonite!

47:21.463 --> 47:23.673
Come on, Kryptonite!
Look at him!

47:23.799 --> 47:26.175
Forget it. It's over.
It's all over.

47:26.301 --> 47:27.802
- Damn.
- Let's go!

47:27.928 --> 47:31.305
- That's it, Kryptonite!
- Come on, Kryptonite!

47:31.431 --> 47:34.725
Bring me luck!
Come on. Bring me luck!

47:34.852 --> 47:37.937
Come on, Kryptonite!
Hang in there! Come on!

47:38.063 --> 47:39.772
- Oh, shit!
- Come on! Let's go!

47:39.898 --> 47:42.942
Get the...
He bet the fucking horse?

47:43.068 --> 47:45.653
He bet Kryptonite?
Give me the tickets.

47:45.779 --> 47:47.280
But, Sonny, we're winning.

47:47.406 --> 47:50.825
We can't win. The Mush bet Kryptonite.
Fucking jinx!

47:52.286 --> 47:55.663
- We're five lengths in the lead.
- Come on. We've been "mushed."

47:57.040 --> 48:00.209
Come on. I got to get away
from this fucking jinx.

48:02.045 --> 48:04.005
Come on. You can still do it!

48:04.131 --> 48:07.091
Come on, Kryptonite.
You can still do it!

48:07.926 --> 48:11.137
- Hang in there!
- Come on. Take it home!

48:11.263 --> 48:13.556
Hang in there!

48:15.100 --> 48:16.934
No! Shit!

48:17.978 --> 48:22.607
- Fuck! This fucking close!
- I don't believe I lost!

48:23.442 --> 48:25.526
- I don't fucking believe it!
- Hey, C!

48:25.652 --> 48:27.695
I got a tip in the next race for you.

48:27.821 --> 48:30.072
Go fuck yourself!

48:30.198 --> 48:32.700
You're very emotional.

48:35.370 --> 48:38.623
'White Birch
wins it in an absolute shocker! '

48:50.344 --> 48:53.346
We finally got
our own social club.

48:53.472 --> 48:55.306
We called it Deuces Wild.

48:55.432 --> 48:59.101
Drinks were a buck and the jukebox
and the cigarette machine paid the rent.

48:59.227 --> 49:00.937
All we cared about
was hanging out.

49:02.356 --> 49:04.941
We would cut class
and hang out all day and all night.

49:05.067 --> 49:06.817
Nobody wanted to go home,

49:06.944 --> 49:08.986
because God forbid,
you were the first one to go home

49:09.112 --> 49:11.739
and then found out the next day
that you missed something.

49:15.202 --> 49:17.411
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
fellas, whoa!

49:17.537 --> 49:20.206
Look at those broads over there.
They're beautiful!

49:21.083 --> 49:23.417
Look at those broads.
They're beautiful!

49:32.135 --> 49:34.804
Yo, get over here!
Come here!

49:34.930 --> 49:37.431
Put it back in your pants.

49:37.557 --> 49:40.351
- Those fucking broads are both pigs.
- How the hell do you know?

49:40.477 --> 49:43.396
- Fuck you, C.
- How the hell do you know?

49:43.522 --> 49:45.189
They'd fail my test in a second.

49:45.315 --> 49:47.608
- What test are we talking about?
- It has a name or something?

49:47.734 --> 49:50.069
If you wanna know if you can trust a girl
and she is good enough to marry,

49:50.195 --> 49:51.654
she's got to pass the test.

49:51.780 --> 49:55.616
- I call it the Mario test.
- This I got to hear. What's this test?

49:55.742 --> 49:59.704
The test is, you take a girl like that
for a ride in your car, right?

49:59.830 --> 50:04.583
Jump on the highway, you pull up
to one of them big 18-wheelers.

50:04.710 --> 50:07.503
You pull right alongside of it
and get attention of the driver.

50:07.629 --> 50:11.340
Honk your horn. Do what you gotta do.
Make sure he's looking. That's important.

50:11.466 --> 50:14.427
At the same time, put your hand
behind this fucking broad's head,

50:14.553 --> 50:17.221
and you start pushing her head down
between your legs.

50:17.347 --> 50:21.100
- Get the fuck out of here.
- It's for her own good, believe me.

50:21.226 --> 50:24.353
Now, if this girl
goes down on you,

50:24.479 --> 50:26.689
knowing that that guy in the truck
is watching,

50:26.815 --> 50:29.191
- then she's a pig, and can't be trusted.
- It's not gonna work.

50:29.317 --> 50:31.944
You're a sick maniac.
You need some help.

50:32.070 --> 50:34.321
When they're into it,
they do stuff with their hand,

50:34.448 --> 50:36.741
they throw their hair over their ear.
They did it before.

50:36.867 --> 50:38.826
Believe me,
they're fucking pros.

50:55.260 --> 50:57.845
That's the second time
those niggers passed today.

50:57.971 --> 51:00.473
As long as they don't stop,
who gives a fuck?

51:00.599 --> 51:02.725
I give a fuck, that's who.

51:02.851 --> 51:05.394
Did they get out to bother you?
No, they didn't bother you.

51:05.520 --> 51:08.105
Today it's one car, next week it's two,
before you know it

51:08.231 --> 51:10.566
it's their neighbourhood
and they're fucking our broads.

51:10.692 --> 51:12.485
They shouldn't come through here.
Period.

51:12.611 --> 51:15.196
Invite them in.
Make them have a drink.

51:15.322 --> 51:17.323
Baseball-bat their fucking heads.

51:17.449 --> 51:20.451
Hey, you want a shot?
Take one. Come back!

51:23.663 --> 51:26.332
Louie? Dumps! Get over here!
Where's my money?

51:26.458 --> 51:28.876
I got to do that thing.
I can't...

51:29.002 --> 51:30.419
- Shit!
- What's up?

51:30.545 --> 51:33.214
This guy owes me 20 bucks.
It's been two fucking weeks now.

51:33.340 --> 51:35.925
You can't dodge me forever!

51:36.051 --> 51:38.094
Fucking piece of shit.

51:47.771 --> 51:49.647
I gotta talk to my father.
I'll be right back, all right?

51:49.773 --> 51:53.818
- All right, I'll see you.
- Come back.

51:59.699 --> 52:01.617
Come on. Take a ride with me.
I got one trip left.

52:01.743 --> 52:04.537
- Do I have to?
- Yeah, you have to. Come on.

52:12.212 --> 52:13.838
Sit. Sit over here.

52:22.347 --> 52:25.349
Dad, do we have to listen to this music?
It gives me a headache.

52:25.475 --> 52:28.602
You kids today, I gotta tell you,
you don't even know what good music is.

52:28.728 --> 52:30.271
Listen to this. This is good music.

52:38.738 --> 52:40.739
Want to go to the fights
with me tomorrow night?

52:41.741 --> 52:46.579
Calogero?

52:48.039 --> 52:49.415
Hey! You listening to me?

52:50.375 --> 52:52.084
Calogero! Hey!

52:52.919 --> 52:55.087
Dad, why can't you call me C?
Everybody calls me C.

52:55.213 --> 52:57.882
Because that was your grandfather's
name, and that's the name I gave you.

52:58.008 --> 53:00.885
That's why I can't call you C
or whatever you want to call yourself.

53:04.598 --> 53:06.223
Want to go to the fights
tomorrow night?

53:07.601 --> 53:11.395
- Could I let you know tomorrow?
- You wanna go or you don't wanna go?

53:12.480 --> 53:15.482
- All right, all right, I'll go.
- Don't say it like that.

53:15.609 --> 53:19.069
Don't wanna be twisting your arm,
but you know...

54:24.469 --> 54:27.137
She was tall,
she was beautiful,

54:27.264 --> 54:29.014
and she was classy.

54:29.891 --> 54:31.267
But she was black.

54:34.020 --> 54:36.730
And that was a no-no
in my neighbourhood.

54:55.458 --> 54:59.253
- Jackie, what's the first?
- 2:00, fellas.

54:59.379 --> 55:02.172
- Two. Your friend's number.
- Who?

55:02.299 --> 55:04.842
- Your pal.
- Don't fuck around.

55:04.968 --> 55:07.177
- Johnny Biscord bet 228 again?
- That's it.

55:07.304 --> 55:08.554
- Again?
- Again.

55:09.514 --> 55:12.725
I'll try to have some better music
for you next time.

55:12.851 --> 55:15.394
I'm only kidding.
It's OK, Pop.

55:19.649 --> 55:21.358
See you later.

55:41.379 --> 55:44.673
- Louie!
- My grandmother's sick.

55:44.799 --> 55:47.051
I'll talk to you later.

55:47.177 --> 55:49.553
- I got to go do something.
- Where's my fucking money?

55:52.223 --> 55:54.516
You're fucking dead when I catch you,
you piece of shit!

55:54.642 --> 55:56.852
C, come here!

55:57.854 --> 55:59.396
- Get over here.
- He's fucking crazy, this kid.

56:00.315 --> 56:02.733
The kid wants his fucking money.
What can you do?

56:02.859 --> 56:06.570
- I got to talk to him.
- You gotta stop babying him.

56:08.156 --> 56:09.573
He owes me money.

56:09.699 --> 56:13.202
- Hit him with a fucking bat.
- Knock him all over the fucking block.

56:13.328 --> 56:17.039
Is that the advice you give the kid,
you fucking hoodlums?

56:17.165 --> 56:20.667
Come on. Don't listen
to these hoodlums.

56:21.378 --> 56:23.754
I'm gonna go to Gino's.
I'll be right back.

56:24.798 --> 56:26.465
What's the matter?

56:26.591 --> 56:29.009
This guy Louie Dumps over here,
he owes me 20 dollars.

56:29.135 --> 56:33.347
It's been two weeks now, and every time
he sees me he keeps dodging me.

56:33.473 --> 56:36.892
He's becoming a real pain in the ass.
Should I crack him one, or what?

56:37.018 --> 56:39.812
What's the matter?
What have I been telling you?

56:39.938 --> 56:42.689
Sometimes hurting somebody
ain't the answer.

56:42.816 --> 56:45.818
- First of all, is he a good friend of yours?
- No, I don't even like him.

56:45.944 --> 56:48.946
You don't even like him.
There's your answer right there.

56:49.072 --> 56:52.199
Look at it this way:
It costs you 20 dollars to get rid of him.

56:52.325 --> 56:56.036
He's never bother you again.
He's never gonna ask you for money again.

56:56.162 --> 56:58.997
He's out of your life for 20 dollars.
You got off cheap. Forget him.

56:59.124 --> 57:02.501
- You're always right. You're always right.
- Yeah, I'm always right.

57:02.627 --> 57:05.421
If I was always right, I wouldn't have done
10 years in the joint.

57:05.547 --> 57:07.548
What did you do every day?

57:07.674 --> 57:10.134
There's only three things
you can do in the joint, kid:

57:10.260 --> 57:12.636
Lift weights, play cards
or get into trouble.

57:12.762 --> 57:15.305
- What did you do?
- Me? I read.

57:16.474 --> 57:18.475
What did you read?

57:18.601 --> 57:20.519
- Ever hear of Machiavelli?
- Who?

57:20.645 --> 57:24.481
Machiavelli. He's a famous writer
from 500 years ago.

57:24.607 --> 57:26.900
Availability.
That's what he always said.

57:27.026 --> 57:29.903
- Availability?
- That's right. Listen to me.

57:30.989 --> 57:33.407
You know why I live
in this neighbourhood?

57:34.159 --> 57:35.367
Availability.

57:35.493 --> 57:37.911
I want to stay close
to everything,

57:38.037 --> 57:40.789
because being on the spot,
I can see trouble immediately.

57:40.915 --> 57:43.959
Trouble is like a cancer.
You got to get it early.

57:44.085 --> 57:46.378
If you don't get it early,
it gets too big, and it kills you.

57:46.504 --> 57:48.297
That's why you got to cut it out.

57:48.423 --> 57:49.923
Capish?

57:52.093 --> 57:56.013
You're worried about Louie Dumps.
Nobody cares!

57:57.557 --> 58:01.351
Worry about yourself, your family,
the people that are important to you.

58:02.103 --> 58:04.229
That's what it comes down to:
Availability.

58:05.231 --> 58:08.358
The people that see me every day
that are on my side,

58:08.485 --> 58:11.028
they feel safe
because they know I'm close.

58:12.113 --> 58:13.864
That gives them
more reason to love me.

58:13.990 --> 58:17.826
But the people that want to do otherwise,
they think twice,

58:17.952 --> 58:19.953
because they know I'm close.

58:20.079 --> 58:21.872
That gives them
more reason to fear me.

58:21.998 --> 58:24.291
Is it better
to be loved or feared?

58:25.835 --> 58:27.961
That's a good question.

58:28.087 --> 58:30.547
It's nice to be both,
but it's very difficult.

58:30.673 --> 58:32.883
But if I had my choice...

58:33.009 --> 58:34.843
I would rather be feared.

58:36.262 --> 58:38.472
Fear lasts longer than love.

58:38.598 --> 58:40.933
Friendships that are bought with money
mean nothing.

58:41.059 --> 58:44.061
You see how it is around here.
I make a joke, everybody laughs.

58:44.187 --> 58:46.021
I know I'm funny,
but I'm not that funny.

58:47.482 --> 58:51.276
It's fear that keeps them loyal to me,
but the trick is not being hated.

58:52.070 --> 58:53.904
That's why I treat my men good,
but not too good.

58:54.030 --> 58:56.406
I give too much,
then they don't need me.

58:56.533 --> 58:59.493
I give just enough where they need me,
but they don't hate me.

59:01.162 --> 59:03.163
Don't forget what I'm telling you.

59:05.208 --> 59:08.377
Sonny, I got some
beautiful veal chops today.

59:08.503 --> 59:11.046
I got some nice linguine frutti di mare

59:11.172 --> 59:14.383
and I got some beautiful Pescatore sauce.

59:57.093 --> 59:59.303
Fellas, you're not dressed properly.
You're gonna have to leave.

59:59.429 --> 01:00:01.555
Properly? What's wrong
with how we're dressed?

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:04.850
These gentlemen ain't dressed right.
I asked them to leave.

01:00:04.976 --> 01:00:06.685
Is there a problem?

01:00:06.811 --> 01:00:08.729
Your man there says
we're not properly dressed.

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:11.064
Like our money ain't green.
We just want a couple of beers.

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:13.066
Two beers, that's it?

01:00:13.192 --> 01:00:16.445
That's it. We'll be on our way.
We ain't looking for trouble.

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.448
Spoken like a gentleman.
Give them their beers.

01:00:19.574 --> 01:00:20.949
- I appreciate that.
- No problem.

01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:27.331
Here you go.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.791
You got some brews down here?
Nice cold ones.

01:00:29.917 --> 01:00:31.376
Get us some nice cold brews.
Come on.

01:00:32.378 --> 01:00:34.087
Two over here, huh?

01:00:36.674 --> 01:00:40.802
One more beer.
Got some thirsty people here.

01:00:40.928 --> 01:00:45.349
All right, brothers.
If I may, a toast to our host.

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:48.810
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost!

01:00:48.936 --> 01:00:50.937
Get wet, you dago wop!

01:00:55.568 --> 01:00:57.069
Hey!

01:00:57.195 --> 01:00:59.071
Oh, you again, huh?

01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:01.698
That wasn't very nice.
Now yous gotta to leave.

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:04.701
I'll tell you when the fuck we leave.
Get the fuck away from me.

01:01:09.123 --> 01:01:11.458
Go watch the bikes, man.

01:01:11.584 --> 01:01:15.128
- What's going on here?
- Come on!

01:01:17.548 --> 01:01:21.301
- Hey, get outta here!
- What's this shit?

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:23.804
What's going on here?

01:01:27.016 --> 01:01:28.392
Now yous can't leave.

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:31.937
I will never forget
the look on their faces.

01:01:32.063 --> 01:01:36.066
All eight of them.
Their faces dropped.

01:01:36.192 --> 01:01:40.612
All their courage and strength
was drained from their bodies.

01:01:40.738 --> 01:01:43.824
They had a reputation
for breaking up bars.

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:47.035
But they knew that instant
they made a fatal mistake.

01:01:47.161 --> 01:01:48.870
This time, they walked
into the wrong bar.

01:01:48.996 --> 01:01:51.248
Come on, motherfucker!

01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:13.937
Crack his fucking head open!

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:35.167
You fucking creep!

01:02:37.628 --> 01:02:39.546
Come here, you cocksucker!

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.934
Step on his fucking head!

01:02:55.688 --> 01:02:58.190
Come on, get them out of here!

01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:00.692
Drag them the fuck out!
Come on, move it!

01:03:10.244 --> 01:03:11.411
Watch my car!

01:03:18.669 --> 01:03:20.337
Yeah, you fucking bums!

01:03:21.547 --> 01:03:24.174
Get him!
Grab that hairy bastard!

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.592
Let the kids kill them.

01:03:25.718 --> 01:03:28.094
- For God's sake.
- Hit him with the bat!

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:29.387
Get him!

01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:34.184
Kick him in his face!

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:35.685
Here, you motherfucker!

01:03:36.729 --> 01:03:38.313
Look at me.

01:03:38.439 --> 01:03:41.650
I'm the one who did this to you.
Remember me.

01:03:44.445 --> 01:03:46.988
Come on, Sonny!
Come on, let's go, you guys!

01:03:48.574 --> 01:03:52.744
- They ruined my lunch!
- Let's get the fuck out, Sonny!

01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:57.749
Leave them there
like the bums that they are.

01:04:01.712 --> 01:04:04.297
They ruined my whole fucking lunch!
Come on!

01:04:20.106 --> 01:04:22.315
Take a look at this gun
right here.

01:04:22.441 --> 01:04:24.067
It's a.45.

01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:28.071
This thing could stop an elephant
driving a truck and the truck too!

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:30.407
Nicky Zero was
the neighbourhood thief.

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:33.451
His mother called him Zero, cos she
said he'd never amount to nothing.

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:35.579
It's too big.
Where are you gonna hide it?

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:38.707
- Then you want this one.
- They can spot that a mile away.

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:42.794
- You need this.
- Whoa! What is wrong with you?

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:46.590
- Don't point the gun.
- It's on safety. I'm not gonna kill you.

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:50.093
Don't ever do that.
Now let me see the fucking gun.

01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:54.014
- This is you. This is class.
- I don't know.

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:57.058
- What's this?
- Let me see this one.

01:04:58.227 --> 01:05:01.187
- This one's nice.
- Right there. Feel it.

01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:03.982
I'm gonna fucking shoot somebody,
know what I mean?

01:05:04.108 --> 01:05:07.235
I wanna shoot somebody too.
That looks like just the gun to do it.

01:05:07.361 --> 01:05:10.989
What are you guys doing, huh?
What's going on here?

01:05:11.115 --> 01:05:16.286
Are you fucking stupid or something?

01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:19.456
What's the matter with you, selling guns
around here? Are you fucking stupid?

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:21.791
You'll make this whole place hot
and get us all fucking pinched.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:24.669
Now get the fuck outta here!

01:05:24.795 --> 01:05:28.256
Stay over here. Don't move.
All of you. Stay right there.

01:05:28.382 --> 01:05:31.509
I want no fucking guns. You hear me?
Get out of here!

01:05:31.636 --> 01:05:33.845
C, get over here, you!

01:05:33.971 --> 01:05:37.015
Come here. I wanna talk to you.
Get over here.

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:46.816
- Sonny, loan me 500.
- Tomorrow, tomorrow!

01:05:53.366 --> 01:05:56.576
You think you're a tough guy
with these guns, is that what it is?

01:05:56.702 --> 01:05:59.037
No, but after what happened
in the bar, I thought...

01:05:59.163 --> 01:06:01.748
You thought what? You think a gun
makes you a tough guy?

01:06:01.874 --> 01:06:05.543
Let me tell you, I seen more guys
with guns wet the bed than anything.

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:07.921
It's when the other guy
pulls out his gun,

01:06:08.047 --> 01:06:09.798
then we see who the real tough guy is.

01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:12.550
- Sonny, you don't understand.
- No, I do understand.

01:06:12.677 --> 01:06:15.387
This shit is not for you. Those kids
are gonna get you in trouble.

01:06:15.513 --> 01:06:19.516
- But they're my friends, you know that.
- They're jerk-offs.

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.476
Look at me.

01:06:21.602 --> 01:06:25.647
Jerk-offs.
And Slick is the biggest jerk-off.

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:28.274
All these years,
what have I been telling you?

01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:31.319
I know, "Stay in school.
Get two educations." I know.

01:06:31.445 --> 01:06:34.197
That's right. Don't do what I do.

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:37.033
This is my life, not yours.

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:40.620
I do what I have to do.
This is not for you.

01:06:40.746 --> 01:06:42.622
All right. I'm sorry.

01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:49.212
Want to go to the fights
with me tomorrow?

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:50.797
I don't know.

01:06:50.923 --> 01:06:53.383
I got a piece of a good middleweight.

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:55.468
You come with me, we'll sit in front.

01:06:55.594 --> 01:06:59.305
I'd like to come,
but I told my father I'd go with him.

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:02.142
You know where I'm sitting,
come by and say hello.

01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:05.061
- All right.
- You know where I'm sitting.

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:16.281
Sit here.

01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:20.869
Nice seats. I gotta be careful
I don't get a nosebleed.

01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:23.621
These are the best I can do.
What do you want from me?

01:07:23.748 --> 01:07:26.166
Come on, Pop, I'm only kidding.

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:58.239
Hi, C. How are you doing?
Hello, Lorenzo.

01:07:58.365 --> 01:07:59.657
How are you doing?

01:07:59.784 --> 01:08:04.287
Sonny has a couple of ringside
seats for you. Why not come down?

01:08:05.289 --> 01:08:06.790
Well, erm...

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:10.919
Tell him thanks,
but we're good where we are.

01:08:11.045 --> 01:08:12.796
OK.

01:08:14.965 --> 01:08:17.383
Tell Sonny thanks anyway,
but we're good where we are.

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:20.804
You're welcome to come down.
You know where the seats are.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:23.139
Anytime during the fight, OK?

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:25.100
OK. Thanks.

01:08:25.225 --> 01:08:28.269
Introducing the principals
for this evening's main event.

01:08:28.395 --> 01:08:31.356
Dad, he's got seats for both of us.
He's trying to be our friend.

01:08:31.482 --> 01:08:35.568
I like my seat. I paid for my seat.
You wanna go down there, go.

01:08:35.694 --> 01:08:38.238
Go ahead. Go down there.

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:42.242
Let's welcome
Eric "The Rock Man" Holland!

01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:49.290
I bring you here, and you wanna go
down with them. Go with them.

01:08:49.416 --> 01:08:52.377
You think I want to sit with you
when you wanna be with them?

01:08:54.796 --> 01:08:56.631
How do you think
that makes me feel?

01:08:56.756 --> 01:08:59.676
From the Bronx, Joe Carey!

01:09:04.055 --> 01:09:06.057
Sorry if I hurt you, Dad.

01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:17.359
Everything I've been telling you.

01:09:35.962 --> 01:09:37.796
Fucking guy's been ducking me
for two weeks.

01:09:37.923 --> 01:09:39.549
When I see him,
I'm gonna break his face.

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:41.968
- Do you like him?
- He's a fucking jerk-off!

01:09:42.094 --> 01:09:44.554
Ten dollars. You got off cheap.
He's out of your life.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.515
I'm still gonna fucking break his face...

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:57.358
I couldn't believe it.
There she was, right in front of me.

01:09:57.484 --> 01:10:01.070
I never forgot her since the first day
I saw her on my father's bus.

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:05.241
I wanted to talk to her, but she was
with her friends and I was with mine.

01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:26.429
These fucking doo-woppers,
driving me crazy,

01:10:26.555 --> 01:10:28.806
I wanna strangle one of them...

01:10:43.989 --> 01:10:47.659
- Let's get something to eat.
- This fat bastard ate it all.

01:10:47.785 --> 01:10:49.661
What's wrong with you?
You're always eating.

01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:53.456
- I was hungry.
- Did you read about the bikers?

01:10:53.582 --> 01:10:55.041
- No.
- I was reading the paper.

01:10:55.167 --> 01:10:57.961
You see the way
Jimmy was hitting them?

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:01.381
- What about Danny with that pipe?
- I don't know.

01:11:01.507 --> 01:11:03.800
- Let's get out of here.
- You wanna get out of here?

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:05.885
Come on. Let's go.

01:11:07.054 --> 01:11:08.888
Come on, C.

01:11:09.014 --> 01:11:11.724
- I can't come. I got a test.
- Fuck the test.

01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:13.768
I missed it last week.

01:11:13.894 --> 01:11:17.230
You sure? All right.
We'll be at The Deuces.

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:54.851
We were alone for the first time.
I knew I had to say something to her.

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:56.978
This chance might
never come again.

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:02.984
I wanted to be cool, but I still didn't
even know her name.

01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:07.113
I said to myself, "She must have an
exotic name like Monique or Danielle."

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:18.041
- You go to this school?
- I'm Jane.

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:20.501
Jane? That's it?
That's your name?

01:12:20.627 --> 01:12:22.253
Yeah. What's wrong with that?

01:12:22.379 --> 01:12:24.881
Nothing. It's a great name.
I love that name.

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:27.008
I just moved here.

01:12:27.134 --> 01:12:29.469
Yeah, I seen you on the bus
the other day.

01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:32.972
- And you are?
- Me, I'm Calogero.

01:12:33.098 --> 01:12:36.225
- Ca-who?
- Calogero.

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:38.644
- What kind of name is that?
- It's Italian.

01:12:38.771 --> 01:12:41.773
Actually, it's Sicilian.
My family's from Sicily.

01:12:41.899 --> 01:12:43.608
Sicily?

01:12:43.734 --> 01:12:45.860
You know where Italy is?
It's the boot that comes down.

01:12:45.986 --> 01:12:49.906
The island next to it that looks like
it's getting kicked, well, that's Sicily.

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:52.700
- I like Italians.
- You do?

01:12:52.826 --> 01:12:56.954
- Hm-mm.
- Are you waiting for someone?

01:12:57.081 --> 01:12:59.957
- Yes, I am.
- Oh, you are.

01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:02.543
All right. Well, I better go.

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:06.798
Wait.

01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:11.928
I was just waiting for my brother.
Sometimes we walk home together.

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:15.014
- If it's no problem, I'll walk you home.
- OK.

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.975
I live down Webster Avenue.
Is that all right?

01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:21.687
That's no problem.
Come on. Let's go.

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:25.858
- So you're waiting for your brother?
- Hmm.

01:13:25.984 --> 01:13:28.861
- That's great.
- What's so great about it?

01:13:28.987 --> 01:13:31.364
What's so great about it?
It's just great.

01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:35.952
Where did you get that hat from?

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:39.372
- Why, you don't like this hat?
- It's kinda funny-looking.

01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:43.000
Maybe it'd look better another way.
Hold this.

01:13:51.552 --> 01:13:53.845
You have beautiful eyes.

01:13:55.389 --> 01:13:57.098
Thanks. So do you.

01:14:00.936 --> 01:14:03.813
Yeah... that's better.

01:14:04.898 --> 01:14:07.733
So, do you want to go to the movies?

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:10.695
Movies? You wanna go
to the movies with me?

01:14:10.821 --> 01:14:15.491
- Yeah. I told you I liked Italians.
- You wanna go right now?

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:18.411
No, of course not now.

01:14:18.537 --> 01:14:22.957
How about tomorrow?
6:00. We'll meet in front.

01:14:23.083 --> 01:14:25.460
I'll be waiting here
till tomorrow then.

01:14:28.672 --> 01:14:32.758
Oh, I'm sorry. I mean I'll meet you
in front tomorrow.

01:14:32.885 --> 01:14:33.968
OK.

01:14:34.094 --> 01:14:37.763
Sorry if I'm saying stupid stuff.
It's just I'm so nervous.

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:41.642
You're not saying stupid things.
You're doing OK.

01:14:41.768 --> 01:14:44.687
- You think so?
- Hm-mm.

01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:46.939
So where are you originally from?

01:14:47.065 --> 01:14:49.150
- Brooklyn.
- What part?

01:14:49.276 --> 01:14:51.068
- East New York.
- Where's that?

01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:53.279
It's far. Way out.

01:14:53.405 --> 01:14:56.574
Yeah? I got some relatives in Brooklyn
but I never heard of that part.

01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.910
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:14:59.036 --> 01:15:01.954
- I suppose they're Italian too, huh?
- Yeah.

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.789
That figures.

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:07.502
- What's your last name?
- Williams. Very easy. Very simple.

01:15:07.628 --> 01:15:12.340
Jane Williams.
That's a pretty easy name to say.

01:15:12.466 --> 01:15:14.717
Can't say mine's that easy,
but, you know...

01:15:14.843 --> 01:15:16.677
Wait, let me see. Erm...

01:15:16.803 --> 01:15:20.181
Calogero... Anello?

01:15:20.307 --> 01:15:21.891
- Yeah.
- Got it.

01:15:22.017 --> 01:15:26.103
- My friends call me C.
- Well, I like Calogero better.

01:15:29.566 --> 01:15:32.235
These books are heavy.

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:34.820
That's why I'm glad
you're carrying them.

01:16:07.521 --> 01:16:09.063
Well...

01:16:10.023 --> 01:16:12.066
I guess this is it.

01:16:12.192 --> 01:16:14.902
- I really had a great time.
- Me too.

01:16:16.071 --> 01:16:19.073
- I think you're very nice.
- Thanks. So are you.

01:16:19.199 --> 01:16:20.866
Thank you.

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:27.206
Sorry I can't walk you
all the way home.

01:16:27.332 --> 01:16:31.502
Oh, that's all right.
I only live a block down.

01:16:31.628 --> 01:16:35.006
- So I'll see you tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

01:16:35.132 --> 01:16:37.341
Tomorrow night? 6:00?

01:16:37.467 --> 01:16:39.719
You're getting better.

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:41.679
I just wanted to double-check.

01:16:42.931 --> 01:16:45.433
Well. Bye.

01:16:45.559 --> 01:16:47.018
Bye.

01:17:25.057 --> 01:17:27.391
What is it, white motherfucker?

01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:40.029
Cinque! Sette!

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:41.697
- Come on, Aldo.
- Sette!

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.995
That was a late fucking finger.
That was late.

01:17:48.121 --> 01:17:52.333
- Was it late, Mario? Tell me.
- What are you talking about?

01:17:52.459 --> 01:17:55.336
This fucking kid keeps
winning my money!

01:17:55.462 --> 01:17:58.881
I'll give him the malocchio.
He ain't gonna win no more...

01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:01.842
He's got all my money.
How am I gonna play?

01:18:01.968 --> 01:18:03.427
I don't know...

01:18:07.724 --> 01:18:09.600
What the fuck, man?

01:18:09.726 --> 01:18:11.644
What the fuck?

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:14.397
These fucking spooks can't ride
in their own neighbourhood?

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:15.940
Just leave them alone.

01:18:16.066 --> 01:18:18.401
What is it with you
and these niggers lately?

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:21.112
- They ain't bothering nobody.
- They're fucking bothering me.

01:18:21.238 --> 01:18:23.781
They ain't bothering me.

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:32.123
This is our fucking neighbourhood,
you black bastard!

01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:37.837
Let's go get these fucking niggers!
Come on!

01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:40.005
Get the fuck
out of our neighbourhood!

01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:43.342
- Let's get out of here!
- Get off!

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:46.804
Motherfucker, get the fuck outta here!

01:18:48.223 --> 01:18:49.932
Black bastard!

01:18:56.982 --> 01:18:58.774
C, come here!

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.529
Leave me alone!

01:19:04.781 --> 01:19:07.324
Hey, grab him, C!
Get this motherfucker!

01:19:07.451 --> 01:19:11.787
Stay down! I'm not gonna hurt you.
Stay down. I don't wanna hurt you.

01:19:11.913 --> 01:19:14.206
Get him! Get him down!

01:19:20.005 --> 01:19:21.172
Motherfucker!

01:19:21.298 --> 01:19:24.383
C, what are you doing,
dancing with him? Get off!

01:19:26.219 --> 01:19:29.472
Get out of here, you crazy bastards.
The cops are coming, run!

01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:31.515
I can see them. Go! Go!

01:19:31.641 --> 01:19:34.143
- I can see the lights.
- Get off him!

01:19:34.269 --> 01:19:37.104
They called the cops! Come one!
Let's go!

01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:38.814
They called the cops!

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:40.983
What the fuck you doing, man?

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:44.320
- You're gonna kill him!
- I don't care. I want to kill him!

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:47.323
- The fucking cops are coming!
- Fuck that!

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:51.285
The cops are coming!
They called the fucking cops! Come on!

01:20:01.505 --> 01:20:03.881
Didn't I tell you
Slick was nothing but trouble?

01:20:04.007 --> 01:20:06.425
Yeah, but he's my friend, I just...

01:20:07.719 --> 01:20:10.471
He's your friend.
I'm your friend, kid.

01:20:10.597 --> 01:20:12.765
You're letting yourself
get caught up in his shit.

01:20:12.891 --> 01:20:16.060
These kids could hurt you.
You gotta think for yourself.

01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:19.980
I do, I'm really trying,
but we hate these people.

01:20:20.106 --> 01:20:21.774
I don't hate them, but you know...

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.610
What people?
What's on your mind?

01:20:24.736 --> 01:20:27.571
- I met this girl.
- Yeah? So?

01:20:27.697 --> 01:20:32.576
I like her and everything, but she ain't
white, she's from Webster Avenue.

01:20:32.702 --> 01:20:35.412
- She's a coloured broad.
- Yeah.

01:20:35.539 --> 01:20:38.999
- You like this girl?
- I do, but I don't wanna hear the guys...

01:20:39.125 --> 01:20:43.045
Fuck those kids. Half of them
are gonna end up dead or in jail.

01:20:43.171 --> 01:20:45.047
Nobody cares.

01:20:45.173 --> 01:20:49.677
Only that matters is what's good for you
and how you feel about each other.

01:20:51.304 --> 01:20:53.055
Let me tell you something.

01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:56.600
When you're alone, late at night in bed,
just you and her under the covers,

01:20:56.726 --> 01:20:58.602
that's all that matters, see?

01:20:58.728 --> 01:21:01.522
You gotta do
what your heart tells you to do.

01:21:01.648 --> 01:21:03.607
I'll tell you something right now.

01:21:03.733 --> 01:21:06.694
You're only allowed three
great women in your lifetime.

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:09.905
They come along like great fighters,
once every ten years.

01:21:10.031 --> 01:21:13.450
Rocky Marciano,
Sugar Ray Robinson, Joe Louis.

01:21:14.327 --> 01:21:16.245
Sometimes you get them all at once.

01:21:16.371 --> 01:21:22.167
Me? I had my three when I was 16.
That happens. What are you gonna do?

01:21:22.294 --> 01:21:26.964
That's the way it goes, you know?
I tell you right now. See this girl?

01:21:28.008 --> 01:21:31.552
Maybe this girl puts wind
in your sails.

01:21:32.971 --> 01:21:37.057
- Maybe she's your first great one.
- Thanks, Sonny. I think I'll go for it.

01:21:37.183 --> 01:21:41.061
- Is she a good kid?
- I just met her, but I hope so.

01:21:41.187 --> 01:21:43.314
Here's what you do.
Tomorrow you borrow my car.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:45.774
- You don't lend anybody your car.
- I'll lend you my car.

01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:47.651
I want you to make
a good impression.

01:21:47.777 --> 01:21:50.279
You borrow my car,
then you give her the test.

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:52.114
What, the Mario test?

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:55.117
Mario's a fucking psycho.
Why do you listen to this kid?

01:21:55.243 --> 01:21:57.494
Give her my test, the door test.

01:21:57.621 --> 01:21:59.788
- What's the door test?
- Listen to me.

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:02.499
You pull up right where she is, right?

01:22:02.626 --> 01:22:05.586
Before you get out of the car,
you lock both doors.

01:22:05.712 --> 01:22:08.297
You get out of the car,
you walk over to her.

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:10.299
You bring her over to the car.

01:22:10.425 --> 01:22:13.594
You take out the key, put it in the lock,
open the door for her.

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:16.388
Then you let her get in.
Then you close the door for her.

01:22:16.514 --> 01:22:19.683
You walk around the back of the car
and look through the rear window.

01:22:19.809 --> 01:22:22.102
If she doesn't reach over
and lift up that button

01:22:22.228 --> 01:22:24.313
so you can get in,
dump her.

01:22:24.439 --> 01:22:26.607
- Just like that?
- Listen to me, kid.

01:22:26.733 --> 01:22:30.194
If she doesn't reach over, lift up
that button for you so you can get in,

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:33.447
she's a selfish broad and all you're
seeing is the tip of the iceberg.

01:22:33.573 --> 01:22:35.783
Dump her and dump her fast.

01:22:35.909 --> 01:22:37.701
What about the beautiful things
you just told me?

01:22:37.827 --> 01:22:39.912
Do what my heart tells me to do.

01:22:40.038 --> 01:22:43.415
Find someone to put wind
in my sails. She could be a great one.

01:22:43.541 --> 01:22:45.834
Bullshit, kid.
The door test, that's what counts.

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:48.087
You dump her,
and you dump her fast.

01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:50.339
- Dump her?
- Dump her.

01:22:52.342 --> 01:22:54.635
Dump her?

01:23:03.019 --> 01:23:06.105
- Dad. Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

01:23:08.358 --> 01:23:11.110
I need your opinion. You know
Joey Osso from down the block?

01:23:11.236 --> 01:23:12.486
Yeah.

01:23:12.612 --> 01:23:14.989
He asked me what I thought about
him going out with a coloured girl.

01:23:15.115 --> 01:23:18.367
- What do you think about that?
- Joey can't find any white girls?

01:23:18.493 --> 01:23:21.370
That's not a good answer, Dad.
What's the problem?

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:23.372
I get along with everybody
on the bus,

01:23:23.498 --> 01:23:27.042
but when it comes to marriage,
we should marry within our own.

01:23:27.168 --> 01:23:31.088
- You know I'm not prejudiced...
- Don't tell me that, cos you are.

01:23:31.214 --> 01:23:34.008
What would you say if I wanted
to go out with a coloured girl?

01:23:34.134 --> 01:23:35.884
You would never do that.

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:38.262
You never know. This girl
might be one of the great ones.

01:23:38.388 --> 01:23:41.807
You're only allowed three great women
in your lifetime, know what I'm saying?

01:23:41.933 --> 01:23:45.602
- Who told you that?
- Joey Osso.

01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:48.522
- Joey Osso?
- Hmm.

01:23:48.648 --> 01:23:52.651
You tell Joey Osso that
sometimes in the heat of passion,

01:23:52.777 --> 01:23:54.820
the little head tells
the big head what to do,

01:23:54.946 --> 01:23:57.865
and that the big head
should think twice about it.

01:23:57.991 --> 01:23:59.992
All right.

01:24:00.118 --> 01:24:02.077
Be careful.

01:25:32.544 --> 01:25:34.545
- You OK?
- No.

01:25:34.671 --> 01:25:37.005
My brother got beat up
in your neighbourhood.

01:25:37.132 --> 01:25:38.340
What are you talking about?

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:42.177
Yesterday, some Italian guys beat up
my brother in your neighbourhood.

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:45.514
- What's that have to do with me?
- Were you there?

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:49.393
- No, I wasn't there.
- Calogero, please don't lie to me.

01:25:49.519 --> 01:25:51.520
Jane, I'm telling you the truth.
I wasn't there.

01:25:51.646 --> 01:25:54.731
We'll see who's lying.
My brother's in the car.

01:25:54.858 --> 01:25:58.152
I told him I was going out
with an Italian, so he came along.

01:25:58.278 --> 01:26:00.779
He recognized you
and said you beat him up.

01:26:00.905 --> 01:26:03.907
- You did that to his face.
- I didn't touch your brother.

01:26:04.033 --> 01:26:07.369
- Believe me, I didn't touch him.
- OK, we'll see.

01:26:07.495 --> 01:26:09.037
Willy!

01:26:15.712 --> 01:26:17.713
We'll get this straight right now.

01:26:26.347 --> 01:26:29.808
Yeah, that's him. That's him.

01:26:29.934 --> 01:26:31.852
You did this to me, man.

01:26:31.978 --> 01:26:33.562
- I didn't do anything...
- Yes, you did!

01:26:33.688 --> 01:26:35.689
- Are you sure it was him?
- I'm positive!

01:26:35.815 --> 01:26:38.233
Please don't believe him.
I didn't touch him.

01:26:38.359 --> 01:26:40.819
- So you were there?
- But I didn't do anything, Jane.

01:26:40.945 --> 01:26:44.489
- Believe me...
- You told me you weren't there!

01:26:44.616 --> 01:26:46.617
It was the other guys.
I tried to help him.

01:26:46.743 --> 01:26:49.661
- How did my eye get like this?
- I tried to fucking help you!

01:26:49.787 --> 01:26:52.497
- Bullshit, man!
- You know I didn't do anything.

01:26:52.624 --> 01:26:54.917
- Why were you on top of me?
- It was the others!

01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:58.003
- It was you!
- I was the only guy helping you.

01:26:58.129 --> 01:27:01.924
- And you fucking repay me like this?
- Fuck that! No, fuck you, man!

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:03.342
I didn't do anything!

01:27:03.468 --> 01:27:06.595
Fuck you, you fucking nigger!

01:27:08.848 --> 01:27:12.559
See what I'm talking about?
Just like the rest of them!

01:28:07.615 --> 01:28:09.658
How come you're back so fast?

01:28:09.784 --> 01:28:12.286
The keys are in the car. I gotta go.

01:28:12.412 --> 01:28:15.080
Whoa! Wait a minute. Come here.
What happened?

01:28:15.206 --> 01:28:17.791
It just didn't work out. I gotta go.

01:28:17.917 --> 01:28:20.961
- What happened with the girl?
- Everything went wrong.

01:28:21.087 --> 01:28:25.507
- You wanna go to the trotters with us?
- No. I don't wanna talk. I gotta go.

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:29.720
- C, you sure? Come on.
- Maybe next time, Sonny.

01:28:34.851 --> 01:28:36.268
Come on.

01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:41.606
- Take my car. Bobby, you drive.
- OK, Sonny.

01:29:06.257 --> 01:29:08.884
- Why are you driving Sonny's car?
- What are you talking about?

01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:12.220
What am I talking about?
I just saw you driving Sonny's car.

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:15.223
- I don't want you driving his car.
- I'm not in the mood to hear this.

01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:19.353
I don't care. We already talked about
the bikers and that fight in that bar.

01:29:19.479 --> 01:29:22.397
- I don't want you in that bar.
- What was I gonna do, run away?

01:29:22.523 --> 01:29:25.650
- Make them think I got no heart?
- You think those guys care?

01:29:25.777 --> 01:29:27.778
What make you think
you're so special?

01:29:27.904 --> 01:29:30.113
- You don't know Sonny.
- I know how he thinks.

01:29:30.239 --> 01:29:32.032
You fuck up,
he'll hurt you like anybody.

01:29:32.158 --> 01:29:34.701
- Sonny trusts me.
- That man can't trust anybody.

01:29:34.827 --> 01:29:37.871
The sooner you know that the better.
How many times do I have to tell you?

01:29:37.997 --> 01:29:39.998
People don't respect him.
They fear him.

01:29:40.124 --> 01:29:42.084
There's a big difference.
You wanna be somebody?

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:44.795
Be somebody who works
and takes cares of his family.

01:29:44.921 --> 01:29:47.381
Yeah, look away. Look...

01:29:47.507 --> 01:29:50.926
You're my only son. I'm looking out
for your best interests.

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:53.136
The saddest thing in life
is wasted talent.

01:29:53.262 --> 01:29:57.057
- I don't wanna hear this.
- You don't but you're gonna hear it.

01:29:57.183 --> 01:29:59.559
I might not have any money,
I might not have a Cadillac,

01:29:59.685 --> 01:30:01.603
but I don't have to look
over my shoulder.

01:30:01.729 --> 01:30:04.356
I don't answer to anybody.
My parents came here with nothing...

01:30:04.482 --> 01:30:06.733
- And they died with nothing.
- Hey!

01:30:06.859 --> 01:30:09.861
Don't you dare disrespect
your grandparents! Do you hear me?

01:30:09.987 --> 01:30:12.364
And you're wrong.
They tried to give me a better life.

01:30:12.490 --> 01:30:14.741
- That's what I'm trying to...
- What better life?

01:30:14.867 --> 01:30:17.828
We don't even own a car!
We ain't got money, we ain't got nothing!

01:30:17.954 --> 01:30:21.164
Don't take it out on me
cos you're a bus driver.

01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:22.833
The working man is a sucker!

01:30:37.807 --> 01:30:41.393
Hey, C. Look what these black
motherfuckers did to our club.

01:30:41.519 --> 01:30:44.646
You believe the balls on these niggers,
throwing eggs at our club?

01:30:44.772 --> 01:30:48.108
Come on, get in the car.
We're gonna go fuck them up.

01:30:48.234 --> 01:30:49.985
Come on, get in the car.

01:30:51.946 --> 01:30:57.617
- Uh-oh, Sonny and Jimmy!
- Oh, shit! Back off! Get out of here!

01:30:57.743 --> 01:30:59.411
What's going on, Sonny?

01:31:01.038 --> 01:31:03.081
After you picked up my car,
where did you go?

01:31:03.207 --> 01:31:06.126
I drove around and
went to pick up Jane. Why?

01:31:06.252 --> 01:31:09.713
- Was there really a Jane? Talk to me!
- Sonny, what is it?

01:31:09.839 --> 01:31:12.007
After you dropped that car off,
it didn't start.

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:14.843
We lifted the hood and there was
something on the engine. It didn't go off.

01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:19.848
Tell me how that got on there,
and where did you go in my car!

01:31:19.974 --> 01:31:22.684
I picked it up,
I drove right to the school

01:31:22.810 --> 01:31:24.519
and I locked the doors
like you told me.

01:31:24.645 --> 01:31:27.522
Don't lie to me!
Where did you go with my car?

01:31:27.648 --> 01:31:30.025
I didn't do anything!
I swear, Sonny! Please!

01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:33.528
- Don't fucking lie to me!
- I didn't do anything!

01:31:33.654 --> 01:31:37.365
I swear, I just went right
to the school and that was it!

01:31:37.492 --> 01:31:41.620
I swear to God! Why would I hurt you?
You've been like a father to me!

01:31:54.592 --> 01:31:57.594
Calogero? Hey!

01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:00.347
Calogero! Calogero!

01:32:00.473 --> 01:32:02.933
- What happened to my son?
- Go drive your bus.

01:32:03.059 --> 01:32:06.228
- Don't tell me to drive my bus!
- Take it easy!

01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:09.981
Put your hands on me,
I'll stick you in the fucking ground!

01:32:11.609 --> 01:32:16.071
Next time find out what's going on
before you open your mouth.

01:32:28.251 --> 01:32:30.001
Yo, C!

01:32:31.337 --> 01:32:32.879
Come here.

01:32:40.429 --> 01:32:43.765
- What happened with you and Sonny?
- Nothing. I don't wanna talk about it.

01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:48.895
- Where'd you get this car?
- Don't worry about it. We borrowed it.

01:32:51.941 --> 01:32:54.067
Hey, slow down!

01:32:54.193 --> 01:32:56.319
Slow the fuck down. I don't wanna
get pinched before we get there.

01:32:56.445 --> 01:33:00.991
- I know. I'm not driver for nothing.
- We're in a hot car. Slow down.

01:33:01.117 --> 01:33:04.411
Fuck you! I know what I'm doing.
Don't worry about it.

01:33:04.537 --> 01:33:08.456
- What's that smell?
- We made those niggers a cocktail.

01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:11.209
Look at these fucking beauties.

01:33:11.335 --> 01:33:14.087
We're gonna teach
those motherfuckers a lesson.

01:33:14.213 --> 01:33:17.966
- We're gonna finish the job.
- Throwing eggs at our joint? They'll see.

01:33:18.092 --> 01:33:20.885
Here, Ralphie, take this.

01:33:22.346 --> 01:33:26.308
- Why don't you give me the big one?
- Take that and shut the fuck up!

01:33:26.434 --> 01:33:30.270
I'll take these motherfuckers!
I hate them! I'll kill them!

01:33:30.396 --> 01:33:33.189
Ralphie, what are you doing,
lighting a cigarette?

01:33:33.316 --> 01:33:36.067
- Relax! What the fuck?
- You got the cocktails at your feet!

01:33:36.193 --> 01:33:39.696
You take me as a jerk-off? Relax.
I know what the fuck I'm doing.

01:33:39.822 --> 01:33:42.657
I can't wait to see the look
on these motherfuckers' faces.

01:33:42.783 --> 01:33:44.701
I can't wait...

01:33:44.827 --> 01:33:49.497
They were all smiling.
I was too, but I was dying inside.

01:33:49.624 --> 01:33:53.084
I wanted out,
but I couldn't get out of the car.

01:33:53.210 --> 01:33:57.339
What was I going to say?
"Let me out. I'm afraid. I'm a chicken."

01:33:57.465 --> 01:33:59.549
I could never go back
to that neighbourhood.

01:33:59.675 --> 01:34:01.885
They would call me a punk,
a dog, a mutt.

01:34:02.011 --> 01:34:04.429
They would say I got no heart.

01:34:04.555 --> 01:34:08.224
I kept hearing my father's voice
in my head. "Don't blow it, son.

01:34:08.351 --> 01:34:12.437
"These people will hurt you, son.
Don't waste your talent, son."

01:34:12.563 --> 01:34:14.356
Then I kept hearing Sonny's voice.

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:19.152
"Be careful, C. Don't lose it, C.
Keep your head, C."

01:34:19.278 --> 01:34:23.615
Somebody pulled the chain,
and I was going down the fucking toilet.

01:34:29.664 --> 01:34:33.375
They wanna throw eggs at our club?
We'll give them a big surprise.

01:34:37.338 --> 01:34:39.923
- C, out of the car.
- Sonny, come on, he's with us.

01:34:40.049 --> 01:34:42.550
Mind your business, you.
C, outta the car.

01:34:42.677 --> 01:34:45.011
Sonny, he's with us...

01:34:45.137 --> 01:34:47.180
- Come on. Move.
- My nose! Fuck!

01:34:52.103 --> 01:34:55.605
For the last time,
stay away from this kid.

01:35:19.922 --> 01:35:23.341
I can't believe it. After all this time,
you don't even trust me?

01:35:24.009 --> 01:35:25.802
Listen.
It's not that I don't trust you.

01:35:25.928 --> 01:35:30.557
No, I'm not gonna listen. You don't
even believe there was a Jane.

01:35:30.683 --> 01:35:32.642
It coulda been in the car
when I picked it up.

01:35:32.768 --> 01:35:36.688
Me and Jane coulda got killed.
You never thought that, did you?

01:35:39.442 --> 01:35:42.360
- Don't you trust anybody?
- No.

01:35:44.572 --> 01:35:47.365
It's a horrible way to live.

01:35:47.491 --> 01:35:49.868
For me, it's the only way.

01:35:49.994 --> 01:35:55.290
Not for me.

01:36:10.389 --> 01:36:14.476
Oh, C. Some fine-looking black chick
was just here looking for you.

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:17.854
- She just went around the corner?
- If you hurry, you'll catch her.

01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:20.148
- Come here. Come here!
- Told you.

01:36:23.861 --> 01:36:27.530
- You want me to go get him?
- No, leave him alone.

01:36:29.617 --> 01:36:31.409
Jane!

01:36:34.038 --> 01:36:37.582
Hi. My brother told me the truth.
You did try to help him.

01:36:37.708 --> 01:36:39.083
I told you.

01:36:39.210 --> 01:36:41.669
I know. But he took it out on you.

01:36:41.796 --> 01:36:44.130
It's OK.
I understand how he felt.

01:36:44.256 --> 01:36:46.174
I'm glad you understand.

01:36:50.763 --> 01:36:54.307
Mind your own damn business!
Get back in your house!

01:36:55.976 --> 01:36:58.728
Let them stare.
Give me your hand.

01:37:00.648 --> 01:37:03.775
Come on, give me your hand.

01:37:07.238 --> 01:37:09.405
- Glad you came to see me.
- I missed you.

01:37:09.532 --> 01:37:10.907
I missed you too.

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:15.537
I think you're beautiful.

01:37:16.497 --> 01:37:18.248
Stop.

01:37:18.374 --> 01:37:21.125
No, I really do.

01:37:21.252 --> 01:37:24.712
I want to be with you,
and I don't care what anybody says.

01:37:25.881 --> 01:37:29.509
- Can I have a kiss?
- Sure.

01:37:38.227 --> 01:37:40.019
That's not a kiss.

01:37:41.647 --> 01:37:43.064
This is a kiss.

01:37:56.287 --> 01:38:00.206
- Do you know how to make sauce?
- What?

01:38:00.332 --> 01:38:02.750
You know, sauce for macaroni?

01:38:04.169 --> 01:38:06.838
Shut up.

01:38:17.933 --> 01:38:19.934
I'm really sorry
about what happened.

01:38:21.604 --> 01:38:23.688
- My brother didn't mean it.
- Where's your car?

01:38:23.814 --> 01:38:26.441
Give me the keys! We gotta go!

01:38:26.567 --> 01:38:29.569
- What are you talking about?
- We gotta get there.

01:38:42.499 --> 01:38:44.584
Yes!

01:38:48.964 --> 01:38:51.174
I knew you were one of the great ones.

01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:53.635
Great ones?
What are you talking about?

01:38:53.761 --> 01:38:56.220
Never mind. It's an Italian thing.

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:10.109
Come on, come on.
Hurry up, make a U-turn over here.

01:39:10.235 --> 01:39:11.653
Go by in front.

01:39:13.697 --> 01:39:17.116
What the fuck are they doing
in our neighbourhood?

01:40:03.956 --> 01:40:05.915
Get it out!

01:40:59.178 --> 01:41:00.845
Be careful, guys.

01:41:00.971 --> 01:41:02.680
- What's happening?
- What happened?

01:41:02.806 --> 01:41:06.434
- Four white guys just got blown up.
- White guys got killed, that's what.

01:41:15.486 --> 01:41:17.445
Willy, are you all right?

01:41:18.906 --> 01:41:20.865
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:41:27.039 --> 01:41:30.208
They started out as white,
now they're toast, motherfuckers!

01:41:30.334 --> 01:41:33.086
They look better now, right?

01:41:33.212 --> 01:41:36.756
They left something for you
in the trunk! Take a look.

01:41:36.882 --> 01:41:39.258
- Get the fuck outta here!
- Get out of our neighbourhood!

01:41:39.384 --> 01:41:41.511
Fucking pussy-ass motherfucker!

01:41:41.637 --> 01:41:44.055
Don't say shit, man!

01:41:44.181 --> 01:41:46.933
Get the fuck outta the neighbourhood!

01:41:48.143 --> 01:41:52.438
When I think about it, I don't know
if I should've been happy or sad.

01:41:52.564 --> 01:41:57.026
Happy because I was alive or
sad because my friends were dead.

01:41:58.237 --> 01:42:00.780
But one thing I knew was
I was grateful.

01:42:00.906 --> 01:42:02.615
Grateful because of Sonny.

01:42:02.741 --> 01:42:05.409
Sonny!
Listen, Jane, I gotta go.

01:42:05.536 --> 01:42:08.329
- I just gotta go. You OK?
- Yeah, man.

01:42:08.455 --> 01:42:12.041
- Listen, I'm sorry.
- Jive-ass white motherfucker!

01:42:12.167 --> 01:42:14.585
Jane, I gotta go.
You don't understand. I was in that car.

01:42:14.711 --> 01:42:17.088
Just go.
The boys are about to go crazy.

01:42:17.214 --> 01:42:20.591
What the fuck you looking at?
Fuck that bitch too!

01:42:22.177 --> 01:42:24.262
Go.

01:42:26.473 --> 01:42:29.433
Get the fuck out of the neighbourhood!

01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:57.670
He saved my life.

01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:12.143
I had to tell him.

01:43:12.269 --> 01:43:14.854
I wanted to thank Sonny.
He saved my life.

01:43:27.451 --> 01:43:31.495
C, I swear, my grandmother's still sick.
I'll give you the 20 next week.

01:43:31.622 --> 01:43:33.289
Forget the 20!

01:43:47.763 --> 01:43:50.681
- You know where Sonny is?
- I don't give a fuck where he is!

01:43:50.807 --> 01:43:53.476
I'm losing here!
What are you breaking my balls for?

01:43:53.602 --> 01:43:55.186
C, he's in the front.

01:43:55.938 --> 01:43:59.774
- Sonny! Sonny!
- C! Come here!

01:44:00.901 --> 01:44:03.986
- Sonny!
- Let him through!

01:44:04.112 --> 01:44:06.739
Let my boy through. Come here!

01:44:06.865 --> 01:44:10.243
- Sonny!
- Get over here, come here.

01:44:13.247 --> 01:44:15.748
All I could see
was these big smiling faces.

01:44:17.125 --> 01:44:21.128
All of a sudden, out of all of these
smiling faces, there was this one face.

01:44:21.255 --> 01:44:23.839
I couldn't understand
why I kept looking at this one face,

01:44:23.966 --> 01:44:26.467
and then I realized why:
He wasn't smiling.

01:44:27.928 --> 01:44:33.349
All I could see was this guy,
and nobody could see him but me.

01:44:35.477 --> 01:44:37.478
Come on, C!

01:44:37.604 --> 01:44:39.647
No!

01:44:40.691 --> 01:44:42.024
Come here!

01:44:49.074 --> 01:44:53.452
Get an ambulance!

01:45:10.804 --> 01:45:13.639
The guy that killed Sonny was the son
of the man that he killed

01:45:13.765 --> 01:45:16.017
eight years earlier
in front of my house.

01:45:54.723 --> 01:45:57.183
There were flowers
all over the place.

01:45:57.309 --> 01:45:59.268
Gangsters have this thing
about flowers.

01:46:00.312 --> 01:46:04.607
They think whoever sends
the biggest arrangement cares the most.

01:46:15.869 --> 01:46:18.871
- John and Anthony from Detroit.
- How are you?

01:46:22.793 --> 01:46:25.461
Did you see the way
he went down, bom-bom-bang?

01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:30.424
It was just like
Sonny said it would be.

01:46:31.385 --> 01:46:36.180
Nobody cares.

01:46:51.738 --> 01:46:54.281
I'm sorry, C,
but we got to close up now.

01:46:56.910 --> 01:46:58.953
Jerry, could you give me
a couple more minutes?

01:46:59.079 --> 01:47:01.122
OK. I'll be in my office.

01:47:22.477 --> 01:47:24.937
How are you doing, Sonny?

01:47:25.063 --> 01:47:27.189
Not so good, huh?

01:47:28.191 --> 01:47:31.527
She passed the test.
That's what I wanted to tell you.

01:47:31.653 --> 01:47:34.613
She might be my first great one.

01:47:34.739 --> 01:47:37.992
And I'm gonna go out with her.
Thanks for helping me.

01:47:39.786 --> 01:47:43.831
I wanna thank you for saving my life.
I never got a chance to tell you.

01:47:45.083 --> 01:47:49.336
They all died.
Slick, Aldo, Mario, Ralphie.

01:47:49.463 --> 01:47:51.672
All of them.

01:47:55.177 --> 01:47:57.803
Sorry, I thought I was alone.
I'm just thinking out loud.

01:47:57.929 --> 01:47:59.930
That's OK.
It's understandable.

01:48:03.935 --> 01:48:06.979
This man here is a great man.
He saved my life.

01:48:13.028 --> 01:48:15.821
- You Lorenzo the bus driver's kid?
- Yeah.

01:48:15.947 --> 01:48:17.990
- C, right?
- Yeah.

01:48:18.116 --> 01:48:19.992
Sonny told me all about you.

01:48:20.118 --> 01:48:22.369
Sorry, but I don't even know
who you are.

01:48:23.246 --> 01:48:25.331
My name is Carmine.

01:48:25.457 --> 01:48:28.292
We go back a long way together,
Sonny and me.

01:48:30.170 --> 01:48:32.254
He saved my life too once.

01:48:36.676 --> 01:48:38.719
You don't remember me, do you?

01:48:40.639 --> 01:48:43.349
Many years ago?
In front of your house?

01:48:44.768 --> 01:48:46.810
You don't remember this?

01:48:47.687 --> 01:48:51.023
You were the guy who got hit
with the baseball bat, right?

01:48:51.983 --> 01:48:55.861
Yeah, I remember.
I was there. I saw the whole thing.

01:48:55.987 --> 01:48:57.488
I know, kid.

01:48:58.949 --> 01:49:00.783
Sonny told me what you did.

01:49:01.701 --> 01:49:04.745
Listen, I've been away.

01:49:04.871 --> 01:49:08.791
But I'll be in the neighbourhood now
taking care of things for a while.

01:49:08.917 --> 01:49:12.711
You need anything,
come and see me at the bar, OK?

01:49:12.837 --> 01:49:16.298
I think I'll give the bar a rest
for a while, but thanks anyway.

01:49:16.424 --> 01:49:18.133
It's OK. I understand.

01:49:19.261 --> 01:49:21.637
Was that fight really
over a parking space?

01:49:23.473 --> 01:49:25.015
No.

01:49:38.863 --> 01:49:42.491
Don't forget. You need anything,
come to the bar and see me.

01:49:42.617 --> 01:49:44.868
- Anything.
- All right.

01:49:44.995 --> 01:49:46.870
So long, kid.

01:49:58.717 --> 01:50:00.759
Dad, what are you doing here?

01:50:04.222 --> 01:50:07.141
I came to pay my respects
to your friend.

01:50:08.685 --> 01:50:10.185
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

01:50:10.312 --> 01:50:12.855
Dad, I'm sorry
if I ever hurt you in any way.

01:50:15.317 --> 01:50:17.276
That's OK.

01:50:17.402 --> 01:50:19.737
Everything's gonna be OK.

01:50:28.705 --> 01:50:32.166
Sonny, I want to thank you
for saving my kid's life.

01:50:35.503 --> 01:50:37.796
I never hated you.
I guess it's...

01:50:39.049 --> 01:50:43.135
...that I was mad at you because
you made him grow up so fast.

01:50:47.307 --> 01:50:49.892
May God have mercy on your soul.

01:50:54.522 --> 01:50:56.357
I'll wait over here.

01:51:01.196 --> 01:51:05.866
Sonny, did you hear that?
My father didn't hate you.

01:51:07.827 --> 01:51:09.620
Nobody cares, huh?

01:51:11.498 --> 01:51:13.582
You were wrong about that one.

01:51:19.297 --> 01:51:20.839
Wasted talent.

01:51:26.179 --> 01:51:28.931
See you around, Sonny.

01:51:37.482 --> 01:51:39.525
Let's go home, C.

01:51:45.782 --> 01:51:47.783
Sonny and my father always said

01:51:47.909 --> 01:51:50.703
that when I get older
I would understand.

01:51:50.829 --> 01:51:53.080
Well, I finally did.

01:51:53.206 --> 01:51:55.457
I learned something
from these two men.

01:51:55.583 --> 01:51:58.544
I learned to give love
and get love unconditionally.

01:51:58.670 --> 01:52:01.964
You just have to accept people
for what they are.

01:52:02.090 --> 01:52:04.174
And I learned
the greatest gift of all.

01:52:04.300 --> 01:52:08.137
The saddest thing in life
is wasted talent.

01:52:08.263 --> 01:52:11.849
And the choices that you make
will shape your life forever.

01:52:13.143 --> 01:52:15.436
But you can ask anybody
from my neighbourhood

01:52:15.562 --> 01:52:17.396
and they'll just tell you.

01:52:17.522 --> 01:52:19.898
This is just another Bronx tale.
