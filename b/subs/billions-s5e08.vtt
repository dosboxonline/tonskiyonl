00:06.173 --> 00:07.508
Mike Prince

00:07.549 --> 00:09.426
is Axe's real enemy.

00:09.468 --> 00:11.595
I want to officially

00:09.468 --> 00:11.595
welcome each of you to...

00:11.637 --> 00:13.180
Taylor Mason Carbon!

00:13.221 --> 00:15.140
-[cheering]

00:13.221 --> 00:15.140
-Whoo! Nice. All right!

00:15.182 --> 00:17.434
You know my new artist,

00:15.182 --> 00:17.434
Tanner? He's not workin'.

00:17.476 --> 00:18.894
You know what,

00:17.476 --> 00:18.894
let me talk to him.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.568
This happened to be

00:24.692 --> 00:26.568
a Nico Tanner original?

00:28.570 --> 00:30.572
[groans]

00:30.614 --> 00:32.115
The doctors

00:30.614 --> 00:32.115
are running some tests,

00:32.157 --> 00:33.868
but they think he'll

00:32.157 --> 00:33.868
need a kidney transplant.

00:33.909 --> 00:35.953
My father wasn't

00:33.909 --> 00:35.953
healthy enough to pass

00:35.995 --> 00:37.913
the workup to get

00:35.995 --> 00:37.913
on the donor list.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.456
I have a guy.

00:39.498 --> 00:41.375
They need you to rip

00:39.498 --> 00:41.375
a letter on my behalf

00:41.416 --> 00:43.084
out of the SEC and grease

00:41.416 --> 00:43.084
the skids

00:43.126 --> 00:44.670
-to a charter.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.670
-Sure.

00:44.712 --> 00:47.255
Welcome to the NYAG.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.132
Today, you're gonna go

00:47.297 --> 00:49.132
after a cabinet member.

00:49.174 --> 00:52.093
Secretary of the Treasury,

00:49.174 --> 00:52.093
Todd Krakow.

00:52.135 --> 00:54.555
We have a problem

00:52.135 --> 00:54.555
with the assignment.

00:54.596 --> 00:58.308
<i>I'm not part of</i>

00:54.596 --> 00:58.308
<i>a criminal enterprise...</i>

00:58.350 --> 01:00.101
He's out. Fired by

00:58.350 --> 01:00.101
the White House.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.062
[whispering]

01:00.143 --> 01:02.062
Back to square fuckin' one!

01:02.103 --> 01:06.734
Is this a reward or

01:02.103 --> 01:06.734
to teach me a lesson?

01:06.775 --> 01:08.610
Both.

01:08.652 --> 01:10.487
We need a rockstar

01:08.652 --> 01:10.487
in our corner, too.

01:10.529 --> 01:11.780
Mike Prince.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.741
Go to him. Enlist him.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.741
Team up.

01:13.782 --> 01:16.201
Get me anyone who

01:13.782 --> 01:16.201
can help us find out

01:16.243 --> 01:19.454
what is near and dear to

01:16.243 --> 01:19.454
Michael Thomas Aquinas Prince.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.957
Because when I find out

01:19.496 --> 01:21.957
what matters to him,

01:21.999 --> 01:24.626
I am going to fuckin'

01:21.999 --> 01:24.626
destroy it.

01:24.668 --> 01:27.671
And him right along with it.

01:47.315 --> 01:49.777
[Royal music playing]

01:58.827 --> 02:00.788
[sighs]

02:00.829 --> 02:02.748
[speaking in Danish]

02:15.010 --> 02:17.387
[sighs]

02:18.472 --> 02:20.265
Ah.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.768
You're putting on this

02:20.307 --> 02:22.768
little show here

02:22.810 --> 02:24.895
instead of at home

02:22.810 --> 02:24.895
and instead of managing

02:24.937 --> 02:26.981
our underperforming employees.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.983
That means you

02:27.022 --> 02:28.983
got somethin' to tell me.

02:29.024 --> 02:32.027
You read me like the

02:29.024 --> 02:32.027
Sunday papers, honcho.

02:32.069 --> 02:34.279
I was re-toxing

02:32.069 --> 02:34.279
last night at the Aviary

02:34.321 --> 02:36.406
and learned one

02:34.321 --> 02:36.406
Michael Prince is ready

02:36.448 --> 02:38.700
to be confirmed

02:36.448 --> 02:38.700
Ambassador Extraordinary

02:38.742 --> 02:40.410
and Plenipotentiary to Denmark.

02:40.452 --> 02:41.954
You don't fuckin' say.

02:41.996 --> 02:43.872
I do.

02:43.914 --> 02:46.667
And while I saw the upside in

02:43.914 --> 02:46.667
him posting up in Copenhagen,

02:46.708 --> 02:49.128
I also envisioned him

02:46.708 --> 02:49.128
parachuting back

02:49.168 --> 02:52.171
into our fair city,

02:49.168 --> 02:52.171
the anointed one.

02:52.213 --> 02:57.011
So I decided to give him

02:52.213 --> 02:57.011
a smorgasbord of shit.

02:57.052 --> 02:59.513
I spent the last 18 hours

02:57.052 --> 02:59.513
in a whirlwind

02:59.554 --> 03:01.890
of Mike Prince

02:59.554 --> 03:01.890
research-wining, dining,

03:01.932 --> 03:03.600
drugging, grooming,

03:03.642 --> 03:05.060
levering, horse-trading...

03:05.102 --> 03:06.394
And the dividend?

03:06.436 --> 03:07.771
Prince keeps himself

03:06.436 --> 03:07.771
locked down

03:07.813 --> 03:09.773
Fort Knox-style.

03:07.813 --> 03:09.773
But one Roger Dunbar,

03:09.815 --> 03:12.359
known to you as Scooter,

03:09.815 --> 03:12.359
is our way in.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.986
The man likes to play

03:12.400 --> 03:13.986
the angles at football

03:14.028 --> 03:15.863
and basketball and horse racing.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.531
Scooter's a sports bettor?

03:17.572 --> 03:20.659
On a staggering scale

03:17.572 --> 03:20.659
through numerous fronts.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.327
He's trying to disguise it,

03:22.369 --> 03:25.455
but no way he can afford

03:22.369 --> 03:25.455
the inevitable swings.

03:25.497 --> 03:28.458
He's leaking like a raft

03:25.497 --> 03:28.458
at a kid's pool party.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.128
And his leaks are

03:28.500 --> 03:31.128
Prince's leaks.

03:31.170 --> 03:33.463
The sort of vulnerability

03:31.170 --> 03:33.463
that stops you

03:33.505 --> 03:35.340
from getting government

03:33.505 --> 03:35.340
security clearance.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.885
And for good reason.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.970
Nail him to the pyre,

03:37.926 --> 03:39.970
douse him with oil,

03:40.012 --> 03:41.388
and light his ass up.

03:41.429 --> 03:44.683
Yes. Joan of Arc style.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.185
But first, a quick nap.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.646
[sighs]

03:54.651 --> 03:58.155
Watch yourself with them

03:54.651 --> 03:58.155
when you go in there later.

03:58.197 --> 03:59.280
You make it sound

03:58.197 --> 03:59.280
like I'm going into

03:59.322 --> 04:00.866
the lion enclosure at the zoo.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.159
[chuckles]

04:02.201 --> 04:03.702
Axe Cap's been called worse.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.412
Yeah.

04:05.453 --> 04:06.914
Or are you just afraid

04:05.453 --> 04:06.914
I'm gonna say something

04:06.955 --> 04:08.373
to make you look bad?

04:08.415 --> 04:11.793
-Fuck no. The opposite.

04:08.415 --> 04:11.793
-[chuckles]

04:11.835 --> 04:13.170
Just... if you're

04:11.835 --> 04:13.170
not used to it,

04:13.212 --> 04:14.713
the money talk

04:13.212 --> 04:14.713
from my colleagues

04:14.755 --> 04:17.925
can be relentless,

04:14.755 --> 04:17.925
shameless, suffocating.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.593
Ah. You know,

04:19.634 --> 04:22.470
only rich people get

04:19.634 --> 04:22.470
embarrassed by money talk.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.472
The rest of us get embarrassed

04:22.512 --> 04:24.472
because we don't have any money.

04:24.514 --> 04:27.392
My job is to train them

04:24.514 --> 04:27.392
to tune every fiber of

04:27.434 --> 04:29.103
their being to get

04:27.434 --> 04:29.103
as much as they can.

04:29.144 --> 04:31.230
But I've seen the

04:29.144 --> 04:31.230
negative effect it can have.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.148
It can restrict growth

04:31.271 --> 04:33.148
in other ways.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.275
Well, you can say that,

04:33.190 --> 04:35.275
'cause you're one of 'em.

04:35.316 --> 04:37.111
You're rich.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.363
How much you make?

04:42.824 --> 04:44.785
-Really?

04:42.824 --> 04:44.785
-Yeah.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.828
It'll clarify things.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.705
My bonus was

04:46.870 --> 04:48.705
$9 million last year.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.333
Jesus.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.253
Look, I get that some of

04:52.375 --> 04:54.253
this is new to you.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.420
And...

04:55.462 --> 04:56.630
you can be who you want to be.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.673
But y-you just seem...

04:58.715 --> 05:00.425
[inhales]

05:00.467 --> 05:02.385
I don't know, overly interested

05:00.467 --> 05:02.385
in what those buyers

05:02.427 --> 05:04.138
like Lisa had to say

05:02.427 --> 05:04.138
the other night.

05:04.179 --> 05:07.099
But when we met, you acted

05:04.179 --> 05:07.099
like money is like chains.

05:07.141 --> 05:11.061
So I guess I'm

05:07.141 --> 05:11.061
just saying, beware.

05:11.103 --> 05:13.981
Yeah, I hear you.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.524
It's just that now that

05:14.022 --> 05:16.524
I have a little bit of it,

05:16.566 --> 05:18.110
that money, I...

05:18.152 --> 05:20.070
it's startin'

05:18.152 --> 05:20.070
to feel like freedom.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.283
Karl!

05:24.324 --> 05:25.617
You rang?

05:28.870 --> 05:31.206
You look ready to toss your cap

05:28.870 --> 05:31.206
into the air at West Point.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.374
Don't make

05:31.248 --> 05:33.374
a whole thing out of it.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.710
Pull the record of every

05:33.416 --> 05:35.710
prisoner I've put away.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.213
-Here and at SDNY.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.213
-Criminal records?

05:38.255 --> 05:40.257
Uh, no, medical records.

05:40.299 --> 05:41.883
I'm lookin' for a kidney.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.885
Pristine quality.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.885
[clicks tongue] Primo.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.720
Ah, Chuck.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.720
Shoppin' for the old man.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.097
I get it.

05:47.139 --> 05:48.598
I used to walk six miles

05:47.139 --> 05:48.598
to the army PX

05:48.640 --> 05:50.725
to get my dad a

05:48.640 --> 05:50.725
pack of Lucky's.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.894
-How's he doin'?

05:50.767 --> 05:52.894
-Hm.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.022
Like Clint Eastwood.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.022
Straight-backed but uh--

05:55.063 --> 05:57.274
But sometimes, he just gets

05:55.063 --> 05:57.274
that lost look in the eyes

05:57.316 --> 05:58.942
and starts talking

05:57.316 --> 05:58.942
to the furniture?

05:58.984 --> 06:00.694
In a sense.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.737
Rough for him.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.737
Rougher for you.

06:02.779 --> 06:03.947
Hmm.

06:03.989 --> 06:05.324
Gets the old compassion flowing.

06:05.364 --> 06:06.533
I'll grab what I can.

06:07.993 --> 06:10.578
Gotta tell ya, it works.

06:07.993 --> 06:10.578
You look great.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.622
-Don't make a whole--

06:10.620 --> 06:12.622
-Copy!

06:17.836 --> 06:20.005
I heard you fell back

06:17.836 --> 06:20.005
to the country place.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.216
Yeah, trying to figure out

06:20.047 --> 06:22.216
how much to sell it for.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.009
Lara always liked it. Me?

06:24.051 --> 06:26.385
I can't stand the quiet.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.385
You interested?

06:26.427 --> 06:28.429
Nah, too rich for my blood.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.724
But you're still interested

06:28.471 --> 06:30.724
in a bank charter, right?

06:30.765 --> 06:32.600
-You know I am.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.600
-Well...

06:32.642 --> 06:34.686
There may be a way

06:32.642 --> 06:34.686
around our obstacle.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.730
When we heard that Rhoades was

06:34.728 --> 06:36.730
teaching up at the law school,

06:36.771 --> 06:38.940
I tapped some Yale connects

06:36.771 --> 06:38.940
I know from boating.

06:38.982 --> 06:42.944
And it turns out he was using

06:38.982 --> 06:42.944
a bunch of the law school kids

06:42.986 --> 06:44.821
as a think tank

06:42.986 --> 06:44.821
to take out Krakow.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.406
Motherfucker.

06:47.448 --> 06:49.617
So I ran my own think tank.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.586
Feels like time for a recount.

06:59.627 --> 07:01.171
Do it.

07:01.213 --> 07:03.131
Find a true believer

07:01.213 --> 07:03.131
amongst those acolytes

07:03.173 --> 07:06.051
and let's get Rhoades caught

07:03.173 --> 07:06.051
in a crossfire hurricane.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.136
And find me another charter.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.136
Get Victor on it.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.148
Designing for the space?

07:20.190 --> 07:21.858
Making sure

07:20.190 --> 07:21.858
it's lit properly.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.652
Right. Like Von Sydow,

07:21.900 --> 07:24.652
not Dusty.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.654
[imitating] "I don't sell

07:24.694 --> 07:26.654
my work by the yard."

07:26.696 --> 07:28.949

15:18.209 --> 15:19.711
Wowza.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.504
-You'd think.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.504
-You didn't like it?

15:21.546 --> 15:23.423
No. I liked it.

15:23.464 --> 15:24.924
Of course I liked it.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.217
[chuckles]

15:26.259 --> 15:27.552
Give me pistachio ice cream,

15:27.594 --> 15:28.928
I'll eat it and smile,

15:28.969 --> 15:31.431
as Diamond David Lee Roth

15:28.969 --> 15:31.431
would say.

15:31.472 --> 15:34.183
But, yeah,

15:31.472 --> 15:34.183
it was uncomfortable.

15:34.225 --> 15:35.894
It's just too many limbs.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.771
-[laughs]

15:35.935 --> 15:37.771
-Too many questions.

15:37.812 --> 15:39.522
[chuckling]

15:37.812 --> 15:39.522
Oh, what to do.

15:39.564 --> 15:40.981
Yeah.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.859
Give me rum raisin,

15:41.023 --> 15:42.859
on the other hand,

15:42.901 --> 15:46.195
I'll inhale the whole pint

15:42.901 --> 15:46.195
and root around the fridge

15:46.237 --> 15:48.072
to find another one.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.116
And that's what I was missing.

15:50.157 --> 15:52.201
Well, Cat seems pretty,

15:50.157 --> 15:52.201
you know, liberated.

15:52.243 --> 15:54.287
Have you broached the subject

15:52.243 --> 15:54.287
of what you really want?

15:54.328 --> 15:56.372
A-as you said,

15:54.328 --> 15:56.372
she's smart and sensitive.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.124
And she saw-- [stammering]

15:58.165 --> 15:59.626
She saw that it

15:58.165 --> 15:59.626
would never work,

15:59.667 --> 16:01.043
not all the way from me.

16:01.085 --> 16:03.379
Not without, you know...

16:01.085 --> 16:03.379
[clicks tongue]

16:03.421 --> 16:05.005
And so she said something

16:03.421 --> 16:05.005
along the lines of,

16:05.047 --> 16:06.633
"We'll always have Paris."

16:06.674 --> 16:09.886
Only the words she

16:06.674 --> 16:09.886
used were harsher, you know?

16:09.928 --> 16:11.304
And all about wasting her time.

16:11.345 --> 16:12.931
-[sighs]

16:11.345 --> 16:12.931
-Shit.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.933
And now I got some

16:12.972 --> 16:14.933
goddamn college kid

16:14.974 --> 16:16.517
wasting my fucking time.

16:16.559 --> 16:18.102
Well, whatever you're

16:16.559 --> 16:18.102
feeling about

16:18.144 --> 16:20.730
what she did to you,

16:18.144 --> 16:20.730
do to him.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.273
And I'll help.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.190
You want half my turkey

17:02.355 --> 17:04.190
and chopped liver?

17:04.231 --> 17:05.608
Underrated sandwich.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.527
Bet I can name two better ones.

17:07.568 --> 17:10.530
And I just know you want in on

17:07.568 --> 17:10.530
the other side of that action.

17:10.571 --> 17:13.324
-Why would I?

17:10.571 --> 17:13.324
-'Cause, like Michael Cheritto,

17:13.366 --> 17:16.494
for you,

17:13.366 --> 17:16.494
the action is the juice.

17:16.536 --> 17:17.787
Don't know him.

17:17.829 --> 17:19.330
You should see<i> Heat.</i>

17:19.372 --> 17:21.207
On my list.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.917
But I get that you're

17:21.248 --> 17:22.917
saying you think

17:22.959 --> 17:24.961
-I'm a gambling man.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.961
-I don't think it.

17:25.003 --> 17:26.629
I observed it.

17:26.671 --> 17:28.214
Those guys are just

17:26.671 --> 17:28.214
scattered to the wind.

17:28.255 --> 17:29.382
They're your runners,

17:28.255 --> 17:29.382
placing your bets

17:29.423 --> 17:31.175
so they don't track back to you.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.260
But I tracked it back.

17:33.302 --> 17:36.014
Look, those guys are

17:33.302 --> 17:36.014
a street marketing team.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.807
I'm building out a brand

17:36.055 --> 17:37.807
on a new company.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.600
Bullshit.

17:39.642 --> 17:42.979
This hobby of yours makes you

17:39.642 --> 17:42.979
vulnerable to extortion.

17:43.021 --> 17:45.481
And that extortion has come.

17:45.523 --> 17:48.359
Prince finds out about this,

17:45.523 --> 17:48.359
he shitcans you,

17:48.401 --> 17:50.110
then you're an orphan

17:48.401 --> 17:50.110
without a purpose.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.280
I thought I was

17:51.320 --> 17:53.280
so GD careful.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.199
None of that matters now.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.701
Give up Prince.

17:58.036 --> 17:59.328
Nothin' to give.

17:59.370 --> 18:01.455
He may be the best

17:59.370 --> 18:01.455
at bleaching.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.583
But no one gets

18:01.497 --> 18:03.583
to 11 figures clean.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.419
Go home.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.254
Remember the thing.

18:08.295 --> 18:10.297
Come tell Axe and me.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.132
And your life stays the same.

18:12.174 --> 18:15.386
Don't, and you lose

18:12.174 --> 18:15.386
everything you hold sacred.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.408
Glad you accepted

18:35.448 --> 18:37.408
my offer to drop by.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.702
I didn't like the

18:37.450 --> 18:39.702
circumstances you left under.

18:41.871 --> 18:44.248
Never bad to march with

18:41.871 --> 18:44.248
your conscience intact.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.876
Not sure I agree with that.

18:46.918 --> 18:51.130
Conscience can be a little bit

18:46.918 --> 18:51.130
like those old nonstick pans.

18:51.171 --> 18:53.173
Flakes off under heat.

18:53.215 --> 18:56.260
Produces noxious fumes

18:53.215 --> 18:56.260
that ruin the whole enterprise.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.220
Now, what you're

18:56.302 --> 18:58.220
really looking for

18:58.262 --> 19:00.431
is a cast iron soul.

19:01.599 --> 19:02.809
Durable, seasoned.

19:04.102 --> 19:05.979
If I wanted advice

19:04.102 --> 19:05.979
about pots and pans,

19:06.020 --> 19:07.981
I'd have signed up

19:06.020 --> 19:07.981
to intern for Guy Fieri.

19:08.022 --> 19:10.066
[chuckles]

19:10.108 --> 19:13.111
Well then, here's the

19:10.108 --> 19:13.111
advice you really came for.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.904
Sign your name

19:14.946 --> 19:16.948
to everything you write.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.282
I don't know what

19:16.990 --> 19:18.282
you're talking about.

19:18.324 --> 19:21.911
You do. And you should own it.

19:21.953 --> 19:23.537
C'mon, do what your

19:21.953 --> 19:23.537
Chef Fieri does.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.915
Use your leverage.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.915
Don't throw it away.

19:25.957 --> 19:28.126
Hell, he started out

19:25.957 --> 19:28.126
with a '67 Camaro,

19:28.167 --> 19:30.670
bleached goatee,

19:28.167 --> 19:30.670
and a hankering for Sloppy Joe,

19:30.711 --> 19:32.171
and he ended up

19:30.711 --> 19:32.171
with an empire.

19:32.212 --> 19:33.881
Morality isn't leverage.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.092
Democracy isn't leverage.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.092
Decency--

19:36.134 --> 19:38.636
It was a student election.

19:38.678 --> 19:42.056
To decide who got to woo

19:38.678 --> 19:42.056
Oingo Boingo to Spring Fling

19:42.098 --> 19:44.224
and push them

19:42.098 --> 19:44.224
not to play Sun City.

19:44.266 --> 19:47.269
It wasn't<i> Il Duce</i> in '34.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.395
There's a difference.

19:48.437 --> 19:49.689
Not as much as you think.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.858
One leads to the other.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.234
Oh, fuck.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.863
I can tell how good

19:54.276 --> 19:56.863
that felt to you to say.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.490
Problem is, it's just not true.

20:04.244 --> 20:05.621
You're right about one thing.

20:05.663 --> 20:08.248
Sending an anonymous

20:05.663 --> 20:08.248
email was weak.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.710
I answer for that now.

20:10.751 --> 20:13.671
Just like you will have

20:10.751 --> 20:13.671
to answer for your mistake.

20:13.713 --> 20:14.630
[scoffs]

20:16.799 --> 20:18.592
Huh.

20:18.634 --> 20:21.095
See, this is where old days

20:18.634 --> 20:21.095
I'd have appealed

20:21.137 --> 20:23.347
to your fear and greed centers.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.518
Dangled an unattainable

20:25.432 --> 20:27.518
post-graduation job

20:27.560 --> 20:29.562
in front of you,

20:27.560 --> 20:29.562
or the specter of some

20:29.603 --> 20:31.772
member of your family

20:29.603 --> 20:31.772
getting into legal trouble.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.900
Instead,

20:33.941 --> 20:37.277
allow me to share with you

20:33.941 --> 20:37.277
a lesson from my own life.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.946
So it's guilt then,

20:37.319 --> 20:38.946
I'm guessin'.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.447
Listen, Merle.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.033
I don't know you,

20:42.075 --> 20:43.743
or what you do or plan

20:42.075 --> 20:43.743
to do with your life.

20:43.784 --> 20:46.079
But I know this.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.497
If you move me out

20:46.120 --> 20:48.497
by using blackmail,

20:48.539 --> 20:50.833
you will be setting

20:48.539 --> 20:50.833
yourself up for a life...

20:52.376 --> 20:53.794
[chuckles]

20:53.836 --> 20:55.629
well, a life quite like mine.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.133
One open to moments of

20:59.175 --> 21:01.385
deep regret and loss of face.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.054
Ah, the stern warning.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.805
The wisdom from down the road.

21:04.847 --> 21:07.225
I'm giving you the most

21:04.847 --> 21:07.225
valuable thing I have:

21:08.308 --> 21:09.977
perspective.

21:10.019 --> 21:12.688
You have the chance

21:10.019 --> 21:12.688
to live a life of honor.

21:12.730 --> 21:14.398
To sleep through the night--

21:14.440 --> 21:16.483
You know what?

21:14.440 --> 21:16.483
I already have a father

21:16.525 --> 21:19.195
who sells me his bad choices,

21:16.525 --> 21:19.195
his object lessons.

21:19.237 --> 21:23.365
You have a day

21:19.237 --> 21:23.365
to resign gracefully.

21:23.407 --> 21:26.452
After that, I'm blasting

21:23.407 --> 21:26.452
the picture out wide.

21:32.250 --> 21:33.500
[door closes]

21:35.920 --> 21:38.714
I may have a vote-rigging

21:35.920 --> 21:38.714
problem on my horizon.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.925
I assume you're not

21:38.756 --> 21:40.925
teeing up a big, juicy case.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.551
Oh, in this scenario,

21:42.593 --> 21:44.262
I'm the golf ball.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.262
Take a look at this.

21:45.345 --> 21:46.513
Hmm...

21:46.555 --> 21:49.183
Nice lighter.

21:46.555 --> 21:49.183
ST. Dupont?

21:49.225 --> 21:51.685
Let's talk about those ballots

21:49.225 --> 21:51.685
I'm taking the lighter to.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.187
Hmm.

21:53.229 --> 21:55.148
Does the election-tampering

21:53.229 --> 21:55.148
bother you?

21:55.189 --> 21:57.483
Nah, I'd have a bigger problem

21:55.189 --> 21:57.483
if you weren't in it to win it.

21:57.524 --> 22:00.069
I was on the right side

21:57.524 --> 22:00.069
of history, if that matters.

22:00.111 --> 22:02.655
Yeah, no, not much.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.364
[inhales]

22:04.406 --> 22:06.075
Look, you were

22:04.406 --> 22:06.075
practically a kid.

22:06.117 --> 22:07.618
I am guessing you

22:06.117 --> 22:07.618
had your reasons

22:07.660 --> 22:09.162
or were just

22:07.660 --> 22:09.162
practicing your moves.

22:09.203 --> 22:11.747
But now as a state

22:09.203 --> 22:11.747
constitutional officer,

22:11.789 --> 22:14.500
your voters may feel differently

22:11.789 --> 22:14.500
about this if it gets out.

22:14.541 --> 22:16.210
That's why I'm here.

22:16.252 --> 22:18.129
You want me to tee up a big,

22:16.252 --> 22:18.129
juicy case,

22:18.171 --> 22:20.380
one that screams out

22:18.171 --> 22:20.380
justice and fairness,

22:20.422 --> 22:22.466
and bumps your tee time

22:20.422 --> 22:22.466
right off the front page.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.260
I do. Yes.

22:24.302 --> 22:26.386
As you'd say...

22:24.302 --> 22:26.386
"Let me work."

22:31.475 --> 22:33.686
I will need you to sign

22:31.475 --> 22:33.686
a contract that states clearly

22:33.727 --> 22:35.980
you're exclusively working here

22:33.727 --> 22:35.980
and nowhere else.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.148
And if I won't sign?

22:37.190 --> 22:38.816
I think maybe then you're gone.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.358
I can't have people here

22:38.858 --> 22:40.358
who are less committed

22:40.400 --> 22:41.861
than contestants

22:40.400 --> 22:41.861
on<i> The Bachelor.</i>

22:41.902 --> 22:43.487
There is no way you've

22:41.902 --> 22:43.487
even seen

22:43.529 --> 22:44.864
one episode of<i> The Bachelor.</i>

22:43.529 --> 22:44.864
How can you--

22:44.905 --> 22:46.240
Sometimes it helps me

22:44.905 --> 22:46.240
fall asleep.

22:46.282 --> 22:47.491
Their insipid self-confidence

22:47.533 --> 22:49.035
and beauty is a somnolent.

22:49.076 --> 22:50.828
But the point is,

22:49.076 --> 22:50.828
if you work with me,

22:50.870 --> 22:52.454
I need your blood,

22:50.870 --> 22:52.454
because that is what I give.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.372
I don't know.

22:54.414 --> 22:56.709
I want you here. You think

22:54.414 --> 22:56.709
clearly. That's rare.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.085
But you can also

22:56.750 --> 22:58.085
communicate clearly.

22:58.127 --> 22:59.837
The combo is more rare.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.714
And then there's

22:59.879 --> 23:01.714
the ability to charm,

23:01.755 --> 23:03.716
get people on your side without

23:01.755 --> 23:03.716
resorting to cheap tricks.

23:03.757 --> 23:07.011
Plus, also, I can see

23:03.757 --> 23:07.011
you struggling to remain

23:07.053 --> 23:09.222
a good person despite

23:07.053 --> 23:09.222
the temptations.

23:09.263 --> 23:11.140
It would seem a mistake

23:09.263 --> 23:11.140
to fire someone

23:11.182 --> 23:13.433
with those characteristics, no?

23:13.475 --> 23:14.810
I don't want to fire you.

23:14.852 --> 23:16.354
You want to own me.

23:17.437 --> 23:18.772
And that's not cool.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.192
You haven't answered me.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.860
Right.

23:56.643 --> 23:59.021
And could be

23:56.643 --> 23:59.021
quite helpful to me.

23:59.063 --> 24:00.689
Yeah. I and everyone now

24:00.731 --> 24:02.440
not only understand

24:00.731 --> 24:02.440
why you stole the election,

24:02.482 --> 24:04.360

Got a hit.

24:54.452 --> 24:56.245
Prisoner named Aman Dekel.

24:56.287 --> 24:58.289

25:45.169 --> 25:48.255
and who you hoped to meet,

25:48.297 --> 25:52.218
but I'm afraid Aman Dekel

25:48.297 --> 25:52.218
isn't gonna make it today.

say, any free man.

26:07.691 --> 26:11.028
From one perspective,

26:07.691 --> 26:11.028

the residents of

26:11.070 --> 26:13.447

26:13.489 --> 26:15.533

26:13.489 --> 26:15.533

26:15.573 --> 26:17.284
And I give them

26:15.573 --> 26:17.284
better treatment than

26:17.326 --> 26:19.328
the hacks in the infirmary.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.539
And that's why they were happy

26:21.579 --> 26:24.458
to come to me

26:21.579 --> 26:24.458
and to lure you in.

26:24.500 --> 26:28.546

27:07.793 --> 27:09.836
get turned inside out.

You were right about getting

27:34.612 --> 27:37.615

You need anything?

27:39.116 --> 27:41.368
Hmm. I'd love a LaCroix.

And an escort for

27:41.410 --> 27:44.037
the Attorney General.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.569
-Thanks, Peach.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.569
-Mm-hmm.

28:40.177 --> 28:41.928
You got my smoke signal.

28:41.970 --> 28:46.475
I did. Thanks for the trip

28:41.970 --> 28:46.475
down memory lane.

28:46.517 --> 28:48.686
It was nicer to relive

28:46.517 --> 28:48.686
than it was to live.

28:52.022 --> 28:53.566

Phew. Healthcare proxy?

29:06.870 --> 29:07.996
Why me?

29:08.038 --> 29:09.665
Because Roxanne's too young.

29:09.707 --> 29:11.166
She'll never let me go.

29:11.208 --> 29:12.751

hoping for a miracle

29:12.792 --> 29:14.878
while I crap myself

29:14.920 --> 29:17.047
and the money runs out.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.674
And Chuck, he might

29:17.089 --> 29:18.674
pull the plug when

29:18.716 --> 29:20.300
I'm in the middle of a sentence.

29:20.342 --> 29:22.344
He's doing everything

29:20.342 --> 29:22.344
he can to help you.

29:22.386 --> 29:24.513
Sure, he is.

29:24.555 --> 29:27.891
But you, you're the one with

29:24.555 --> 29:27.891
liquid silver in her veins,

29:27.933 --> 29:29.809
the cool-headed killer.

29:29.851 --> 29:33.105
You'll do the right thing

29:29.851 --> 29:33.105
at the right time.

29:33.146 --> 29:36.734
At the "right time,"

29:33.146 --> 29:36.734
you'll be comatose,

29:36.775 --> 29:38.485
completely incommunicative,

29:38.527 --> 29:40.070
and you want me to come in

in front of your

29:40.112 --> 29:41.572
young wife and son?

29:41.614 --> 29:43.073
It'll be a total shit show.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.324
That's why I'm asking you.

29:44.366 --> 29:46.076
No, I-- I pray,

29:46.118 --> 29:48.245
to the extent that I pray,

29:48.287 --> 29:50.372
that these decisions

29:48.287 --> 29:50.372
never need be made.

29:51.915 --> 29:53.125
But...

29:55.586 --> 30:00.048
if the worst

29:55.586 --> 30:00.048
comes to pass, Wendy...

30:00.090 --> 30:02.593
if I hit the fucking wall

30:02.635 --> 30:04.886
and become a full gomer,

30:04.928 --> 30:10.267
I need you to be clear-eyed

30:04.928 --> 30:10.267
and punch my ticket.

30:15.314 --> 30:16.607
Can I count on you?

30:16.649 --> 30:18.191
[sighs]

30:19.568 --> 30:20.611
Sure, Dad.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.698
If it comes to it,

30:22.529 --> 30:24.698
I'll put you down.

30:38.712 --> 30:40.798

30:40.839 --> 30:42.716
While I've been out

30:40.839 --> 30:42.716
scouring the countryside

30:42.758 --> 30:44.843
trying to save your life,

30:44.884 --> 30:48.597
you put your trust

30:44.884 --> 30:48.597
in someone else.

30:48.639 --> 30:50.307
Oh, I've been doing

30:48.639 --> 30:50.307
what needs to be done.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.351
Or are you here to tell me

30:52.392 --> 30:55.312
that you found me a donor

30:52.392 --> 30:55.312
and it isn't necessary?

30:55.354 --> 30:56.563
[exhales]

30:58.816 --> 31:00.192
No.

31:00.233 --> 31:02.319
Unfortunately, it is.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.613
I'll leave you two

31:02.361 --> 31:04.613
to settle your business.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.677
Scooter's on his way up.

31:26.719 --> 31:28.595
Heh. Longest elevator

31:26.719 --> 31:28.595
ride of his life.

31:28.637 --> 31:30.597
I knew he was gonna cave.

31:30.639 --> 31:32.808
Saw it in his eyes that he'd

31:30.639 --> 31:32.808
do anything to save himself.

31:32.850 --> 31:34.267
[elevator bell rings]

31:43.902 --> 31:46.864
You look surprised.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.864
Was I not invited?

31:51.326 --> 31:53.078
I felt, in a way, that I was.

31:53.119 --> 31:54.954
Or at least that

31:53.119 --> 31:54.954
my invitation was implied.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.250
Love this.

31:58.291 --> 32:02.962
Raw concrete.

31:58.291 --> 32:02.962
Very wabi-sabi.

32:03.004 --> 32:05.131
You have Rande Gerber

32:03.004 --> 32:05.131
decorate for ya?

32:05.173 --> 32:07.384
[sighs]

32:07.426 --> 32:09.135
Threw yourself at

32:07.426 --> 32:09.135
the merciful hem

32:09.177 --> 32:10.888
of the Shogun skirts?

32:10.929 --> 32:13.223
Not exactly. He was already

32:10.929 --> 32:13.223
well aware of the bets.

32:13.265 --> 32:14.850
Because they were his.

32:14.892 --> 32:16.643
Too bad. Ambassador with

32:16.685 --> 32:18.186
a gambling problem's a no-go.

32:18.228 --> 32:20.397
No problem here.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.358
I have a better winning

32:20.439 --> 32:23.358
percentage than the Vegas books.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.736
Plus, sports betting is

32:23.400 --> 32:25.736
now legal in this state.

32:25.778 --> 32:27.863
Those runners you saw

32:25.778 --> 32:27.863
placed the action for me

32:27.905 --> 32:29.782
at the sports books

32:27.905 --> 32:29.782
at upstate casinos.

32:29.823 --> 32:31.241
Because that much money,

32:29.823 --> 32:31.241
with my profile,

32:31.283 --> 32:32.910
would have moved the lines.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.912
Yes. You had your man

32:32.951 --> 32:34.912
put 'em down

32:34.953 --> 32:36.246
to get you a better price.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.915
Protect and serve.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.541
Don't worry, though,

32:37.956 --> 32:39.541
my records are orderly.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.543
We have it all documented

32:39.583 --> 32:41.543
in exquisite detail.

32:41.585 --> 32:43.295
Taxes paid on all the profits.

32:43.336 --> 32:44.838
And the Danes are

32:43.336 --> 32:44.838
a sporting bunch.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.673
They love a good wager.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.262
You made a mistake

32:50.260 --> 32:52.262
coming here, Mike.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.180
I smoked you out.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.141
You could have had me

32:54.222 --> 32:56.141
wasting my time on this

32:56.182 --> 32:58.184
until your post was clinched.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.562
But now I know which

32:58.226 --> 33:00.562
direction I need to go in.

33:00.604 --> 33:05.024
Without meaning to, you guys

33:00.604 --> 33:05.024
have just revealed it to me.

33:05.066 --> 33:07.068
You're trying to put

33:05.066 --> 33:07.068
a read on me?

33:07.110 --> 33:09.321
Steady hands,

33:07.110 --> 33:09.321
no micro-expressions,

33:09.362 --> 33:11.072
nothing there.

33:11.114 --> 33:13.283
So you can look as long

33:11.114 --> 33:13.283
and hard as you want at my life,

33:13.325 --> 33:15.160
past or present.

33:15.201 --> 33:17.036
There's nothing

33:15.201 --> 33:17.036
there for you to chew on.

33:17.078 --> 33:18.246
You sure?

33:18.288 --> 33:20.039
When a man's bluffing,

33:20.081 --> 33:22.167
he looks a guy

33:20.081 --> 33:22.167
right in the eyes.

33:22.208 --> 33:23.752
I look people in

33:22.208 --> 33:23.752
the eye because

33:23.794 --> 33:25.337
I believe in myself.

33:25.378 --> 33:27.380
And I like to connect with them.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.758
Which is one of the things

33:27.422 --> 33:29.758
I love about the Danes,

33:29.800 --> 33:31.510
their warmth.

33:31.551 --> 33:33.929
They have the most

33:31.551 --> 33:33.929
delightful demeanor

33:33.971 --> 33:35.973
and a wonderful word

33:33.971 --> 33:35.973
to describe their state

33:36.014 --> 33:37.933
of cozy well-being.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.811
<i>Hygge.</i>

33:40.853 --> 33:43.814
It's the contentment of

33:40.853 --> 33:43.814
feeling warm, being warm.

33:43.856 --> 33:45.941
Danes are<i> hygge-like.</i>

33:45.983 --> 33:47.860
And in the time I will be

33:45.983 --> 33:47.860
spending in their midst,

33:47.901 --> 33:50.278
I plan to embrace

33:47.901 --> 33:50.278
their way of life.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.572
While you will remain here--

33:52.614 --> 33:54.324
Cold, lonely,

33:55.784 --> 33:57.202
self-obsessed,

33:57.243 --> 33:59.663
and most assuredly

33:57.243 --> 33:59.663
not<i> hygge-like.</i>

34:09.339 --> 34:10.549
Fuck.

34:12.676 --> 34:14.177
I didn't anticipate the carom.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.762
But what did you pick up on him?

34:15.804 --> 34:18.139
Not a goddamn thing.

34:15.804 --> 34:18.139
I was fucking bluffing.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.350
Next time you

34:18.181 --> 34:20.350
bring me something,

34:20.392 --> 34:22.185
make sure it's something.

34:22.227 --> 34:24.145
You'll always be my guy, Wags.

34:24.187 --> 34:27.232
But don't make me have to get

34:24.187 --> 34:27.232
another guy that you report to.

34:32.696 --> 34:34.781
Now, I said something

34:32.696 --> 34:34.781
to this kid, Merle.

34:34.823 --> 34:36.783
About the cost of these actions.

34:36.825 --> 34:38.869
[clears throat]

34:38.911 --> 34:41.538
And although I was merely

34:38.911 --> 34:41.538
trying to influence him...

34:41.580 --> 34:44.958
Fuck, Ira, I was

34:41.580 --> 34:44.958
him at law school.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.878
And if someone,

34:45.000 --> 34:47.878
anyone had tried to warn me off

34:47.920 --> 34:50.005
becoming who I did,

34:47.920 --> 34:50.005
I'd have listened.

34:50.047 --> 34:53.091
I was right there with you,

34:50.047 --> 34:53.091
and I know exactly who you were,

34:53.132 --> 34:55.635
the smartest and most rigorous

34:53.132 --> 34:55.635
student in our class.

34:55.677 --> 34:57.846
The only one who ever

34:55.677 --> 34:57.846
doubted you was you, man.

34:57.888 --> 35:00.015
And y-you wouldn't

34:57.888 --> 35:00.015
have listened

35:00.057 --> 35:01.767
to any kind of warning

35:01.808 --> 35:04.185
or bromide from anyone,

35:01.808 --> 35:04.185
especially not some--

35:04.227 --> 35:05.854
Some grizzled old pol?

35:05.896 --> 35:07.731
Yeah, something like that.

35:07.773 --> 35:12.318
You know, I always figured

35:07.773 --> 35:12.318
I'd keep growing in a real way.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.988
That the worst parts of me

35:12.360 --> 35:14.988
would recede over time,

35:15.030 --> 35:18.366
that I'd be able to will

35:15.030 --> 35:18.366
myself forward to the better.

35:18.408 --> 35:20.243
Oh, instead?

35:20.285 --> 35:23.080
As 50 looms, you come to see

35:20.285 --> 35:23.080
that those sub-optimal parts,

35:23.121 --> 35:24.664
the bugs, as it were...

35:24.706 --> 35:26.541
[chuckles]

35:24.706 --> 35:26.541
They aren't bugs.

35:26.583 --> 35:28.501
No. Turns out, they are you.

35:28.543 --> 35:30.295
Hmm.

35:28.543 --> 35:30.295
Might not be an age thing.

35:30.336 --> 35:31.838
From the moment our parents

35:30.336 --> 35:31.838
look at us a certain way,

35:31.880 --> 35:35.926
it might all be

35:31.880 --> 35:35.926
set in fucking stone.

35:35.968 --> 35:38.261
You gotta deploy

35:35.968 --> 35:38.261
the materials I gave you.

35:40.597 --> 35:41.723
Nope.

35:43.224 --> 35:45.226
I'm shredding these printouts.

35:45.268 --> 35:47.520
And I need you to destroy

35:45.268 --> 35:47.520
the original package

35:47.562 --> 35:49.106
you put together.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.857
[sighs] I won't.

35:50.899 --> 35:52.484
And neither will you.

35:52.525 --> 35:55.070
I'm glad to know

35:52.525 --> 35:55.070
that you've changed.

35:55.112 --> 35:56.822
In your heart.

35:56.863 --> 35:58.698
But just... what if

35:56.863 --> 35:58.698
you didn't tell your heart

35:58.740 --> 36:01.284
what you were doing yet and

35:58.740 --> 36:01.284
first you got out of this jam?

36:01.326 --> 36:03.161
This kid is

36:01.326 --> 36:03.161
coming for you.

36:03.202 --> 36:06.999
If he had a pistol,

36:03.202 --> 36:06.999
would you let him shoot you?

36:07.040 --> 36:08.792
No, you'd defend yourself

36:08.834 --> 36:11.169
and then go about making amends.

36:11.210 --> 36:13.379
Once you knew you

36:11.210 --> 36:13.379
were still breathing.

36:14.506 --> 36:15.966
Do the same here.

36:18.051 --> 36:19.845
I know you better

36:18.051 --> 36:19.845
than you know yourself.

36:19.886 --> 36:22.764
And I know what you need.

36:22.806 --> 36:24.307
So...

36:24.349 --> 36:26.476
you take that and do

36:24.349 --> 36:26.476
the thing you have to.

36:29.729 --> 36:30.939
[sighs]

36:38.196 --> 36:39.280
Yes?

36:41.449 --> 36:43.284
What's he doing here?

36:43.326 --> 36:45.495
He's part of it.

36:45.537 --> 36:46.913
Part of?

36:46.955 --> 36:47.873
Such a thing.

36:49.624 --> 36:51.168
What is?

36:51.209 --> 36:53.336
[exhales] A violation

36:51.209 --> 36:53.336
of this scope,

36:53.378 --> 36:55.296
given your history?

36:55.338 --> 36:58.008
And to think I wouldn't have a

36:55.338 --> 36:58.008
system in place to monitor you,

36:58.050 --> 36:59.718
given said history.

36:59.759 --> 37:01.386
[whispering]

36:59.759 --> 37:01.386
That's downright insulting.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.472
[clicks tongue]

37:02.637 --> 37:04.472
Such a thing.

37:04.514 --> 37:06.183
All right. That's quite

37:04.514 --> 37:06.183
enough of that.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.143
Though, incredibly,

37:06.224 --> 37:08.143
he is right.

37:08.185 --> 37:10.395
Why are you running

37:08.185 --> 37:10.395
a search through

37:10.436 --> 37:12.397
the employees'

37:10.436 --> 37:12.397
medical records?

37:15.525 --> 37:17.443
Go.

37:17.485 --> 37:19.487
Traditionally,

37:17.485 --> 37:19.487
the scent hound gets

37:19.529 --> 37:22.532
to tear at the quarry

37:19.529 --> 37:22.532
at hunt's end.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.868
Out.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.579
It's nothing personal.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.579
Just business.

37:27.620 --> 37:29.414
I always liked you.

37:36.337 --> 37:37.756
It's Chuck's father.

37:37.797 --> 37:40.092
He's gonna die

37:37.797 --> 37:40.092
unless he gets a kidney.

37:40.133 --> 37:41.718
-So I thought I--

37:40.133 --> 37:41.718
-You should have come to me.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.220
Would you have

37:41.760 --> 37:43.220
let me run the search?

37:43.261 --> 37:45.889
No. But I'd have

37:43.261 --> 37:45.889
saved you from that.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.432
We haven't been able

37:45.931 --> 37:47.432
to save each other

37:47.473 --> 37:48.850
from much lately.

37:50.018 --> 37:51.352
Since you're here,

37:51.394 --> 37:53.438
let me try.

37:53.479 --> 37:54.981
Mike Prince.

37:55.023 --> 37:56.399
Let it go.

37:56.441 --> 37:58.026
I sat with him,

37:56.441 --> 37:58.026
with Taylor.

37:58.068 --> 37:59.444
He's not out to hurt you.

37:59.485 --> 38:01.571
If he wasn't before,

37:59.485 --> 38:01.571
he is now.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.281
Because he knows

38:01.613 --> 38:03.281
my intentions.

38:03.322 --> 38:05.533
Let it go anyway.

38:03.322 --> 38:05.533
In the past,

38:05.575 --> 38:07.535
when I have nudged, counseled,

38:07.577 --> 38:09.746
warned you to lay off

38:07.577 --> 38:09.746
against other opponents,

38:09.788 --> 38:11.581
it's because you were

38:09.788 --> 38:11.581
beating yourself.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.332
Being rash, lacking focus,

38:13.374 --> 38:15.043
becoming consumed

38:13.374 --> 38:15.043
by your own rage.

38:15.085 --> 38:16.836
But in this case,

38:15.085 --> 38:16.836
it's something else.

38:16.878 --> 38:18.630
He'll likely beat you.

38:18.671 --> 38:19.923
I beat him in Yonkers.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.382
Did you?

38:21.424 --> 38:22.926
Or did he kinda

38:21.424 --> 38:22.926
let you have that one?

38:22.968 --> 38:25.262
This is a strange

38:22.968 --> 38:25.262
fucking pep talk, Wend.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.805
Because I'm not giving you one.

38:26.846 --> 38:28.765
[scoffs]

38:28.807 --> 38:30.600
Do you know how many

38:28.807 --> 38:30.600
sports movies I've watched

38:30.642 --> 38:32.393
over the last 20 years?

38:30.642 --> 38:32.393
All of them.

38:32.435 --> 38:34.604
So believe me,

38:32.435 --> 38:34.604
I know how to do 'em.

38:34.646 --> 38:38.566
And I have the right poll

38:34.646 --> 38:38.566
for this moment.

38:38.608 --> 38:42.445
You think he's<i> Tin Cup</i> McAvoy,

38:38.608 --> 38:42.445
and you're Don Johnson,

38:42.487 --> 38:44.781
and you'll let the quirk

38:42.487 --> 38:44.781
in his character defeat him,

38:44.823 --> 38:46.658
but it might just be

38:44.823 --> 38:46.658
the other way around.

38:46.699 --> 38:48.534
Not gonna keep putting

38:46.699 --> 38:48.534
balls in the drink.

38:48.576 --> 38:50.703
That's what Roy thought, too.

38:50.745 --> 38:52.664
But once guys like you

38:50.745 --> 38:52.664
and him commit,

38:52.705 --> 38:54.540
you'll keep hitting until

38:52.705 --> 38:54.540
there are no more Pro V-Ones

38:54.582 --> 38:56.168
-left in your golf bag.

38:54.582 --> 38:56.168
-Right.

38:56.209 --> 38:57.752
So what do you

38:56.209 --> 38:57.752
suggest I do instead?

38:57.794 --> 38:59.838
Figure out who or what

38:59.879 --> 39:01.881
from your past

38:59.879 --> 39:01.881
you're still furious at,

39:01.923 --> 39:03.549
because that's where it

39:01.923 --> 39:03.549
always really comes from,

39:03.591 --> 39:07.220
and go hit that. Or finally

39:03.591 --> 39:07.220
decide to let it go.

39:08.721 --> 39:10.849
The past.

39:10.890 --> 39:12.017
You're right.

39:13.226 --> 39:15.145
It's always the fucking past.

39:17.647 --> 39:19.149
Wags. In here, please.

39:30.118 --> 39:32.912
Axe Capital!

39:32.954 --> 39:34.706
We've been looking

39:32.954 --> 39:34.706
to hit all of Prince's

39:34.747 --> 39:36.457
current holdings

39:34.747 --> 39:36.457
and businesses, right?

39:36.499 --> 39:38.084
As was ordered.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.084
To create a dip

39:38.126 --> 39:39.127
in the value

39:38.126 --> 39:39.127
of his portfolio

39:39.169 --> 39:40.128
before the big feature

39:40.170 --> 39:41.921
on him airs on<i> The Hour.</i>

39:41.963 --> 39:44.674
Axe figured out we're

39:41.963 --> 39:44.674
aiming at the wrong target.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.384
We were with Prince.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.384
And Prince said,

39:46.425 --> 39:48.261
"You can look as long

39:46.425 --> 39:48.261
and hard as you want in my life,

39:48.303 --> 39:50.013
past and present.

39:50.055 --> 39:52.098
There's nothing there

39:50.055 --> 39:52.098
for you to chew on."

39:52.140 --> 39:53.975
But no one said anything

39:54.017 --> 39:55.727
about his past.

39:55.768 --> 39:57.270
Axe picked up on his tell.

39:57.312 --> 39:59.022
He's got a secret.

40:00.232 --> 40:02.275
Fucking find it.

40:03.818 --> 40:06.112
Hey. You know how

40:03.818 --> 40:06.112
we had feelers out

40:06.154 --> 40:07.364
on a half-dozen of

40:06.154 --> 40:07.364
those shady companies

40:07.405 --> 40:09.157
crying out for public execution?

40:09.199 --> 40:11.117
-Yeah, Axe filled me in.

40:09.199 --> 40:11.117
-We're like a fishing boat

40:11.159 --> 40:13.245
with a bunch of lines

40:11.159 --> 40:13.245
over the side.

40:13.286 --> 40:14.412
And we got a tug.

40:14.453 --> 40:15.788
It's called Plaintif-Full.

40:15.830 --> 40:17.374
Good.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.417
Chum the local press.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.417
Wait for another bite,

40:19.458 --> 40:20.752
then set the fucking hook.

40:26.299 --> 40:27.800
[door opens]

40:29.052 --> 40:30.220
Dean Walker is here.

40:31.512 --> 40:32.555
I imagine she is.

40:35.225 --> 40:36.309
[exhales]

40:39.562 --> 40:41.189
Hm.

40:41.231 --> 40:43.441
I had a visit from

40:41.231 --> 40:43.441
a young man named Merle Howard

40:43.482 --> 40:45.860
-a few hours ago.

40:43.482 --> 40:45.860
-I see.

40:45.902 --> 40:47.570
He wanted to throw himself

40:45.902 --> 40:47.570
on the mercy

40:47.612 --> 40:49.530
of the court, so to speak.

40:49.572 --> 40:51.490
He told me of his plans

40:49.572 --> 40:51.490
to blackmail you,

40:51.532 --> 40:54.369
get you ousted, and how

40:51.532 --> 40:54.369
you talked him out of it.

40:54.411 --> 40:57.247
He literally said

40:54.411 --> 40:57.247
he'd misjudged you

40:57.289 --> 40:59.082
and wanted to

40:57.289 --> 40:59.082
report himself to me

40:59.124 --> 41:00.625
for an honor code violation.

41:02.085 --> 41:03.711
I forgave him, of course.

41:03.753 --> 41:05.797
And he asked that I'd drop

41:03.753 --> 41:05.797
the entire matter.

41:05.838 --> 41:07.215
-Really?

41:05.838 --> 41:07.215
-Mm-hmm.

41:08.507 --> 41:09.884
So I did some good. Ha!

41:11.010 --> 41:12.637
Well, that is wonderful news.

41:12.678 --> 41:15.140
Yet we live in an age

41:12.678 --> 41:15.140
that doesn't give me

41:15.181 --> 41:19.018
that opportunity to let it go.

41:19.060 --> 41:20.895
If a student knows

41:19.060 --> 41:20.895
something and tells me,

41:20.937 --> 41:22.855
I have no choice

41:20.937 --> 41:22.855
but to investigate it.

41:22.897 --> 41:24.983
That picture of you, Chuck...

41:25.024 --> 41:28.361
what it says about the whole

41:25.024 --> 41:28.361
foundation of your career.

41:28.403 --> 41:30.196
You have to know

41:28.403 --> 41:30.196
there was context.

41:31.572 --> 41:33.574
I was part of a movement

41:33.616 --> 41:36.077
to push the Yale Corporation

41:33.616 --> 41:36.077
to divest holdings--

41:36.119 --> 41:39.122
You stole an election

41:36.119 --> 41:39.122
for social justice?

41:39.164 --> 41:41.958
Divestment itself

41:39.164 --> 41:41.958
was in the balance?

41:42.000 --> 41:43.293
I could make that case.

41:43.335 --> 41:44.752
Against the

41:43.335 --> 41:44.752
Robertson Wycoff I know?

41:44.794 --> 41:46.296
Sounds like a reach.

41:46.338 --> 41:48.047
Here's your window.

41:46.338 --> 41:48.047
Closing fast.

41:57.807 --> 41:59.058
[scoffs]

42:09.068 --> 42:11.029
I guess I thought

42:09.068 --> 42:11.029
I could make a difference

42:12.489 --> 42:13.781
by winning that election.

42:13.823 --> 42:15.950
So you have.

42:15.992 --> 42:18.370
And I'm sure that picture

42:15.992 --> 42:18.370
of you will never come out.

42:18.411 --> 42:21.456
Merle kept it.

42:18.411 --> 42:21.456
Said he was destroying it.

42:21.498 --> 42:23.416
Well, then is there

42:21.498 --> 42:23.416
a way we can consider

42:23.458 --> 42:24.709
this a closed matter?

42:24.750 --> 42:26.585
Not quite.

42:26.627 --> 42:28.587
That's not the only

42:26.627 --> 42:28.587
thing Merle told me.

42:28.629 --> 42:31.549
He also mentioned a student

42:28.629 --> 42:31.549
law clinic you put together.

42:31.590 --> 42:33.634
He'd made his peace with it.

42:31.590 --> 42:33.634
But from where I sit,

42:33.676 --> 42:35.261
it sounds like

42:33.676 --> 42:35.261
a goddamn hit squad.

42:35.303 --> 42:36.804
I see.

42:36.846 --> 42:38.764
Yale Law School is

42:36.846 --> 42:38.764
the nation's finest

42:38.806 --> 42:41.100
because we refuse to compromise

42:38.806 --> 42:41.100
on our principles.

42:41.142 --> 42:43.436
Even if the money came

42:41.142 --> 42:43.436
from outside sources,

42:43.478 --> 42:45.188
even if it was voluntary.

42:45.230 --> 42:47.315
This is against school policy

42:47.357 --> 42:48.774
and non-fucking-negotiable.

42:51.319 --> 42:53.279
Then I step down.

42:51.319 --> 42:53.279
[clicks tongue]

42:53.321 --> 42:55.656
And you redirect

42:53.321 --> 42:55.656
the money funding

42:55.698 --> 42:56.866
the operation

42:55.698 --> 42:56.866
back to my office--

42:56.908 --> 42:58.784
No. We'll keep the bestowal.

42:58.826 --> 43:00.495
And use it for

42:58.826 --> 43:00.495
the good and fair purpose

43:00.537 --> 43:01.996
for which it was

43:00.537 --> 43:01.996
meant to be used.

43:02.038 --> 43:04.207
But I accept your resignation

43:04.249 --> 43:05.750
and I thank you for it.

43:08.836 --> 43:10.255
You did do a good thing.

43:10.296 --> 43:11.630
Two, really.

43:11.672 --> 43:13.466
Merle Howard has

43:11.672 --> 43:13.466
a chance to be a

43:13.508 --> 43:15.343
productive member of society.

43:15.385 --> 43:18.930
And Yale is now protected

43:15.385 --> 43:18.930
from a mentor like you.

43:20.932 --> 43:24.643
[door opens, closes]

43:24.685 --> 43:26.521
[sighs]

43:32.318 --> 43:33.736
Rough day?

43:33.778 --> 43:35.280
Not my best.

43:36.406 --> 43:38.366
But I did something.

43:40.535 --> 43:42.912
I actually kept a promise

43:40.535 --> 43:42.912
to myself, a good one.

43:44.289 --> 43:45.957
So that's...

43:45.998 --> 43:48.167
I guess the word is progress.

43:48.209 --> 43:50.462
Hmm. So you feel great?

43:50.503 --> 43:52.464
Oh, let's not get carried away.

43:52.505 --> 43:54.757
Well, maybe this will

43:52.505 --> 43:54.757
take it over the top.

43:54.799 --> 43:57.718
I was researching some big,

43:54.799 --> 43:57.718
juicy cases that would put

43:57.760 --> 43:59.845
a halo over your head

43:57.760 --> 43:59.845
and found a small article

43:59.887 --> 44:02.181
in a local paper about

43:59.887 --> 44:02.181
some neighborhood folks

44:02.223 --> 44:04.642
that got fleeced

44:02.223 --> 44:04.642
by a payday lender.

44:04.683 --> 44:06.227
Company's called Plaintif-Full.

44:06.269 --> 44:08.605
[scoffs] Are they as bad

44:06.269 --> 44:08.605
as their name suggests?

44:08.646 --> 44:11.023
Bad-faith operators.

44:08.646 --> 44:11.023
Predatory.

44:11.065 --> 44:13.859
Well, I no longer need it.

44:13.901 --> 44:15.987
But I am in the mood

44:13.901 --> 44:15.987
to take someone down.

44:17.322 --> 44:19.491
[scoffs]

44:19.532 --> 44:22.243
Let's do it because

44:19.532 --> 44:22.243
it's the right thing to do.

44:22.285 --> 44:23.536
Refreshing.

44:23.578 --> 44:24.912
Old school.

44:23.578 --> 44:24.912
Move fast on this.

44:24.954 --> 44:26.414
You know it.

44:29.417 --> 44:30.627
[door closes]

44:33.254 --> 44:34.713
I got it.

44:34.755 --> 44:36.841
When you said the past,

44:36.882 --> 44:39.093
it jogged my memory

44:36.882 --> 44:39.093
of an old<i> Fortune</i> article.

44:39.135 --> 44:40.761
I used to read 'em

44:39.135 --> 44:40.761
on the crapper.

44:40.803 --> 44:42.972
Is that the actual one

44:40.803 --> 44:42.972
from the crapper?

44:43.014 --> 44:46.559
No, I pulled that one

44:43.014 --> 44:46.559
out of archives.

44:46.601 --> 44:49.521
The story is about

44:46.601 --> 44:49.521
Prince's deceased partner,

44:49.562 --> 44:51.105
David Fells.

44:51.147 --> 44:53.525
Now Prince sold off 40%

44:51.147 --> 44:53.525
of his company years ago

44:53.566 --> 44:55.734
to Microsoft, back when

44:53.566 --> 44:55.734
Fells was still alive.

44:55.776 --> 44:57.862
It was his first big score.

44:55.776 --> 44:57.862
His first billion.

44:57.903 --> 45:01.282
But he's always famously

44:57.903 --> 45:01.282
refused to sell off the rest.

45:01.324 --> 45:03.700
To give up control.

45:03.742 --> 45:04.701
And?

45:04.743 --> 45:06.204
And...

45:06.245 --> 45:08.080
this might be a way

45:06.245 --> 45:08.080
for you to wrest control

45:08.122 --> 45:09.790
of his goddamn company

45:08.122 --> 45:09.790
from within,

45:09.832 --> 45:11.501
like a Guinea worm.

45:11.543 --> 45:13.294
Because Fells's

45:11.543 --> 45:13.294
founder's shares come with

45:13.336 --> 45:15.921
ten to one voting rights.

45:15.963 --> 45:17.840
You get those,

45:17.882 --> 45:19.758
you can stage a boardroom coup.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.636
I've been in touch

45:19.800 --> 45:21.636
with Fells's next of kin,

45:21.678 --> 45:23.262
his mother.

45:23.304 --> 45:24.972
She's agreed to meet.

45:25.014 --> 45:28.934
[smacks lips] And she's

45:25.014 --> 45:28.934
no fan of Mike Prince.

45:28.976 --> 45:31.020
-How do you know that?

45:28.976 --> 45:31.020
-'Cause she said,

45:31.062 --> 45:34.065
"I have just what you need

45:31.062 --> 45:34.065
to torpedo Mike Prince."

45:34.106 --> 45:36.526
She has the founder's shares

45:34.106 --> 45:36.526
and the super voting rights.

45:38.110 --> 45:39.696
What else could that mean?

45:39.736 --> 45:41.573
Fuel up your jet?

45:41.614 --> 45:42.781
You know it.

45:42.823 --> 45:44.200
Bring her to me.

45:48.120 --> 45:49.080
[Axe] Mrs. Fells...

45:49.121 --> 45:50.498
Oh, Brenda.

45:50.540 --> 45:52.500
Brenda.

45:52.542 --> 45:54.377
I'm gonna to put this bluntly,

45:52.542 --> 45:54.377
and I'm not

45:54.419 --> 45:57.213
gonna bother negotiating.

45:57.255 --> 46:00.341
I will back up an armored car

45:57.255 --> 46:00.341
for your son's shares.

46:00.383 --> 46:02.885
I-- I'm sorry,

46:00.383 --> 46:02.885
I don't have them.

46:02.927 --> 46:04.721
Uh-uh...

46:04.761 --> 46:08.015
he sold them before he died,

46:04.761 --> 46:08.015
to Michael Prince.

46:08.057 --> 46:09.892
I shouldn't have come.

46:09.934 --> 46:12.811
Well, ma'am,

46:09.934 --> 46:12.811
that is too bad.

46:12.853 --> 46:14.564
But you knew this before

46:12.853 --> 46:14.564
I flew you in.

46:14.606 --> 46:16.857
And you didn't say

46:14.606 --> 46:16.857
don't, so...

46:16.899 --> 46:20.027
That leads me to believe it

46:16.899 --> 46:20.027
might be something else.

46:20.069 --> 46:22.154
Oh, I'm sure it's

46:20.069 --> 46:22.154
something else.

46:22.196 --> 46:25.950
It's something I've known

46:22.196 --> 46:25.950
and carried for years,

46:25.991 --> 46:27.826
since my s-all right, look.

46:28.911 --> 46:30.871
I signed an NDA.

46:30.913 --> 46:33.958
Prince came to me years ago,

46:30.913 --> 46:33.958
right after David was buried.

46:33.999 --> 46:37.503
He gave me money

46:33.999 --> 46:37.503
and he had me sign.

46:37.545 --> 46:39.547
This is just you and me talking.

46:41.215 --> 46:43.926
Whatever you tell me,

46:41.215 --> 46:43.926
and if it's valuable,

46:43.968 --> 46:45.720
and I use it,

46:45.762 --> 46:49.056
I will cover any losses

46:45.762 --> 46:49.056
or liabilities you face.

46:49.098 --> 46:51.100
Only an idiot

46:49.098 --> 46:51.100
would take your word

46:51.142 --> 46:52.893
and not write this up

46:51.142 --> 46:52.893
with lawyers.

46:52.935 --> 46:54.853
Only an idiot

46:52.935 --> 46:54.853
would make the offer.

46:56.606 --> 46:57.982
[scoffs]

47:02.487 --> 47:04.447
My son was brilliant,

47:04.489 --> 47:06.491
but he was troubled.

47:06.532 --> 47:09.034
He had trouble finding

47:06.532 --> 47:09.034
his way through the world.

47:10.495 --> 47:12.455
He didn't make friends easily.

47:12.497 --> 47:15.667
And then he started in with

47:12.497 --> 47:15.667
the drinking and the drugs.

47:16.959 --> 47:19.086
Except for Michael Prince.

47:19.128 --> 47:23.257
Those two spent thousands

47:19.128 --> 47:23.257
of hours in my garage working.

47:23.299 --> 47:25.802
You know, Prince was

47:23.299 --> 47:25.802
like the forward face

47:25.842 --> 47:29.764
of all my son's genius.

47:29.806 --> 47:31.599
And then one day,

47:29.806 --> 47:31.599
he stops by with

47:31.641 --> 47:36.228
what seemed like

47:31.641 --> 47:36.228
a windfall, $200,000.

47:36.270 --> 47:38.564
He said he'd gotten

47:36.270 --> 47:38.564
a licensing agreement

47:38.606 --> 47:40.692
and that he would buy

47:38.606 --> 47:40.692
David's piece of the company

47:40.733 --> 47:42.985
to take the pressure off.

47:43.027 --> 47:44.821
So David could

47:43.027 --> 47:44.821
chill out, you know,

47:44.861 --> 47:47.448
clean up, dry out.

47:47.490 --> 47:50.660
He said that while

47:47.490 --> 47:50.660
the first one didn't work,

47:50.702 --> 47:52.495
they would start

47:50.702 --> 47:52.495
a new company

47:52.537 --> 47:54.079
when David was strong again.

47:54.121 --> 47:56.207
And-and to tip the scales,

47:56.248 --> 47:59.043
he brought along

47:56.248 --> 47:59.043
the check and tickets

47:59.084 --> 48:01.878
to Rio for Carnival.

48:01.920 --> 48:04.507
Michael's gonna join

48:01.920 --> 48:04.507
him on the last day.

48:04.549 --> 48:09.303
So David accepted, he went.

48:09.345 --> 48:11.347
And then the Microsoft deal

48:09.345 --> 48:11.347
was announced,

48:11.389 --> 48:14.559
and the numbers were reported,

48:11.389 --> 48:14.559
and Michael Prince had made...

48:14.600 --> 48:16.561
wh-- uh a hundred times

48:16.602 --> 48:18.437
what he'd paid David,

48:16.602 --> 48:18.437
a thousand.

48:18.479 --> 48:20.147
He knew the offer

48:18.479 --> 48:20.147
was coming.

48:20.189 --> 48:22.066
Oh, he knew,

48:20.189 --> 48:22.066
and he stalled it off

48:22.107 --> 48:24.151
until he could

48:22.107 --> 48:24.151
secure David's piece.

48:24.193 --> 48:26.696
Made it look like a favor

48:24.193 --> 48:26.696
and put him out in the cold.

48:30.366 --> 48:32.785
I mean, do you know

48:32.827 --> 48:35.788
what that does

48:32.827 --> 48:35.788
to a 25-year-old?

48:35.830 --> 48:37.749
To lose out like that?

48:37.790 --> 48:40.209
I mean, to be stabbed

48:37.790 --> 48:40.209
in the back like that

48:40.251 --> 48:41.544
by your best friend?

48:43.546 --> 48:47.299
The drinking and using

48:43.546 --> 48:47.299
went into overdrive.

48:47.341 --> 48:49.385
He said he was

48:47.341 --> 48:49.385
ready to come home.

48:49.427 --> 48:50.595
But he didn't.

48:50.636 --> 48:52.179
He-- he went dark.

48:52.221 --> 48:54.181
And he wound up dying

48:52.221 --> 48:54.181
a month later

48:54.223 --> 48:56.183
in a single-car accident.

48:58.018 --> 48:59.729
Michael Prince

48:59.771 --> 49:02.189
built his fortune

48:59.771 --> 49:02.189
on my son's grave.

49:29.926 --> 49:31.302
[exhales]

49:32.762 --> 49:34.263
I was supposed to--

49:35.932 --> 49:37.892
by now I was supposed

49:35.932 --> 49:37.892
to be done with my PhD

49:37.934 --> 49:40.060
in economic philosophy

49:37.934 --> 49:40.060
at U Chicago.

49:40.102 --> 49:42.897
I'd have published

49:40.102 --> 49:42.897
my dissertation.

49:42.939 --> 49:45.316
But then Bobby Axelrod

49:42.939 --> 49:45.316
put a promise of mentorship,

49:45.357 --> 49:47.735
a meeting of the minds,

49:45.357 --> 49:47.735
a kinship of ideas,

49:47.777 --> 49:51.489
and a way of seeing the markets

49:47.777 --> 49:51.489
I'd never felt before,

49:51.530 --> 49:54.325
and so much money

49:51.530 --> 49:54.325
in front of me that I just...

49:54.366 --> 49:55.534
I never even called

49:54.366 --> 49:55.534
the professor

49:55.576 --> 49:56.828
I was supposed

49:55.576 --> 49:56.828
to go work with.

49:56.869 --> 49:59.288
I just withdrew

49:56.869 --> 49:59.288
from the program.

49:59.330 --> 50:01.624
You wish you were at

49:59.330 --> 50:01.624
the place fun goes to die

50:01.666 --> 50:03.626
instead of making jillions

50:03.668 --> 50:06.629
solving unsolvable

50:03.668 --> 50:06.629
puzzles every day?

50:06.671 --> 50:07.964
I never thought I was

50:06.671 --> 50:07.964
the kind of person

50:08.004 --> 50:09.632
who would be

50:08.004 --> 50:09.632
tempted by all this.

50:09.674 --> 50:12.134
And then I told

50:09.674 --> 50:12.134
myself that anyone, everyone,

50:12.176 --> 50:14.178
would lose a piece of

50:12.176 --> 50:14.178
themselves for this.

50:14.219 --> 50:16.639
It made me able

50:14.219 --> 50:16.639
to justify what I did.

50:16.681 --> 50:18.683
And then here I was.

50:18.724 --> 50:20.768
And it was the perfect chance

50:18.724 --> 50:20.768
to conduct an experiment,

50:20.810 --> 50:22.812
a test case.

50:22.854 --> 50:25.356
Part of you wants me to

50:22.854 --> 50:25.356
make the escape you couldn't.

50:25.397 --> 50:27.900
But the other part

50:25.397 --> 50:27.900
wants me to stay.

50:27.942 --> 50:30.736
To prove to you that no one

50:27.942 --> 50:30.736
can resist the clarion call.

50:30.778 --> 50:32.738
I'm on the wrong side

50:30.778 --> 50:32.738
of our generation.

50:32.780 --> 50:34.532
Even just the four years

50:32.780 --> 50:34.532
between when Axe

50:34.573 --> 50:36.158
put the choice to me,

50:34.573 --> 50:36.158
and now...

50:36.200 --> 50:38.452
No, yeah, you're old.

50:36.200 --> 50:38.452
I'm not.

50:38.494 --> 50:41.622
But I'm not sitting here

50:38.494 --> 50:41.622
like I'm better than you.

50:41.664 --> 50:43.207
Fuck. [scoffs]

50:43.248 --> 50:45.376
You chose something

50:43.248 --> 50:45.376
sturdy and real,

50:45.417 --> 50:48.086
and where, like,

50:45.417 --> 50:48.086
you could land.

50:48.128 --> 50:50.339
I'm still floating.

50:50.381 --> 50:52.925
That's what I've been thinking

50:50.381 --> 50:52.925
about since we last talked.

50:52.967 --> 50:55.260
-How I'm caught between.

50:52.967 --> 50:55.260
-Really?

50:55.302 --> 50:57.388
I don't want to go work in

50:55.302 --> 50:57.388
the Ford plant for 40 years

50:57.429 --> 50:58.806
like a rivet head.

50:58.848 --> 51:01.017
But knowing

50:58.848 --> 51:01.017
I'm really in something?

51:01.057 --> 51:02.476
[sighs]

51:02.518 --> 51:04.186
Yeah, that seems good.

51:06.814 --> 51:09.233
I'm gonna ditch

51:06.814 --> 51:09.233
the catering company.

51:09.274 --> 51:11.736
Good. But I can't let you

51:09.274 --> 51:11.736
just go and do it

51:11.777 --> 51:13.863
without warning you what else

51:11.777 --> 51:13.863
you need to be ready for.

51:13.905 --> 51:16.323
What else one gives up

51:13.905 --> 51:16.323
to go on the journey.

51:16.365 --> 51:18.367
Oh, so what else

51:16.365 --> 51:18.367
do you give up?

51:18.409 --> 51:20.202
Nights, weekends, holidays.

51:20.244 --> 51:21.787
Your world will become

51:20.244 --> 51:21.787
a series of data sets,

51:21.829 --> 51:23.288
line items on a P and L.

51:23.330 --> 51:25.750
Everything broken down

51:23.330 --> 51:25.750
into basis points.

51:25.791 --> 51:27.125
And your victories

51:25.791 --> 51:27.125
will not be the money,

51:27.167 --> 51:28.794
the thing that

51:27.167 --> 51:28.794
anybody can measure,

51:28.836 --> 51:30.796
but the stuff they

51:28.836 --> 51:30.796
can't begin to appreciate.

51:30.838 --> 51:32.381
Looking beyond

51:30.838 --> 51:32.381
what's quantifiable,

51:32.423 --> 51:34.884
the subtle refinements,

51:32.423 --> 51:34.884
the elegance of success.

51:39.055 --> 51:40.681
I'll quit the catering company.

51:40.723 --> 51:43.059
Then buy it.

51:40.723 --> 51:43.059
Turn it over to my friends.

51:43.099 --> 51:45.310
Nice gesture.

51:43.099 --> 51:45.310
They won't appreciate it.

51:45.352 --> 51:47.479
But at least you'll know

51:45.352 --> 51:47.479
you did a good thing for them.

51:47.521 --> 51:49.648
Your real friends,

51:47.521 --> 51:49.648
few as they may be, will get it.

51:49.690 --> 51:50.858
And the ones that don't,

51:50.900 --> 51:52.108
don't have the capacity to be

51:52.150 --> 51:53.402
the kind of friend you need.

51:55.195 --> 51:56.781
So instead of friendship,

51:56.822 --> 51:58.574
you have to use work

51:56.822 --> 51:58.574
to fill the void?

51:58.616 --> 52:00.034
I guess I do.

52:02.244 --> 52:03.871
[sighs]

52:26.310 --> 52:27.352
Thanks for this.

52:27.394 --> 52:28.771
[Axe] Yeah, he was in town.

52:28.813 --> 52:30.689
I figured he'd dig the work.

52:30.731 --> 52:32.733
This is really good work, man.

52:32.775 --> 52:34.860
[Tanner] Cool.

52:34.902 --> 52:36.779
I dig yours.

52:36.821 --> 52:38.906
Hey. You know, maybe you

52:36.821 --> 52:38.906
want to commission one.

52:40.240 --> 52:42.200
I spend most of

52:40.240 --> 52:42.200
my money on guitars

52:42.242 --> 52:44.954
-but I'm thinking about it.

52:42.242 --> 52:44.954
-Yeah, good. Good.

52:44.996 --> 52:46.956
Hey, you want to

52:44.996 --> 52:46.956
come by my place tonight?

52:46.998 --> 52:48.916
I'm having my team by

52:46.998 --> 52:48.916
for a special viewing party.

52:48.958 --> 52:50.626
Oh, no, thank you.

52:50.668 --> 52:52.753
I-I don't ever really

52:50.668 --> 52:52.753
feel comfortable around

52:52.795 --> 52:54.212
the financial set, right?

52:54.254 --> 52:55.714
Oh, yeah. [chuckles]

52:56.966 --> 52:58.801
But there--

52:56.966 --> 52:58.801
there are some upsides.

52:58.843 --> 53:00.594
Only thing that sounds worse

52:58.843 --> 53:00.594
is hanging out

53:00.636 --> 53:02.346
with record label executives.

53:02.387 --> 53:03.681
Especially when

53:02.387 --> 53:03.681
I'm trying to work.

53:03.722 --> 53:05.307
I just want to do my thing.

53:05.349 --> 53:07.101
I don't want to be

53:05.349 --> 53:07.101
somebody's trick monkey.

53:09.645 --> 53:11.730
Anyway, thanks for

53:09.645 --> 53:11.730
showing me this stuff.

53:11.772 --> 53:13.357
Really good.

53:11.772 --> 53:13.357
Really inspirational.

53:13.398 --> 53:14.859
Oh, thanks.

53:17.778 --> 53:19.822
-Hey see you in a bit.

53:17.778 --> 53:19.822
-Yeah.

53:21.824 --> 53:25.828
["It's Good To Be King"

53:21.824 --> 53:25.828
by Tom Petty plays]

53:28.747 --> 53:30.290
-Okay.

53:28.747 --> 53:30.290
-[light chatter]

53:30.332 --> 53:32.626
[laughter]

53:32.668 --> 53:34.586
Does the paint

53:32.668 --> 53:34.586
get on your stuff?

53:34.628 --> 53:36.630
