02:29.440 --> 02:32.443
The Toccoa men, that's
the ones that was there

02:32.527 --> 02:34.320
at the very beginning.

02:34.404 --> 02:38.032
They are very close and, uh,

02:38.116 --> 02:40.994
they accept people
coming in like myself,

02:41.077 --> 02:42.620
as a replacement,

02:42.704 --> 02:45.748
but you also had
to prove yourself.

02:45.832 --> 02:49.002
Most of them were, we know
were qualified parachutists.

02:49.085 --> 02:50.253
They had to be.

02:50.336 --> 02:52.422
A lot of them
were awfully green,

02:52.505 --> 02:53.840
and we knew that.

02:53.923 --> 02:57.093
We just-- We hoped
we could keep 'em alive

02:57.176 --> 02:59.512
or they could keep alive,
a lot of 'em didn't.

02:59.596 --> 03:04.142
But, uh, well, all right,
they eventually...

03:04.225 --> 03:06.144
blend right in.

03:06.227 --> 03:11.024
I think maybe
they were trying to impress

03:11.107 --> 03:15.486
the older guys,
people like me or Shifty...

03:15.570 --> 03:18.531
I don't know why,
but I got right there

03:18.615 --> 03:21.075
to where I didn't want
to be friendly

03:21.159 --> 03:23.494
with replacements coming in

03:23.578 --> 03:26.581
because, God, I didn't like
seeing 'em get killed.

03:26.664 --> 03:29.083
I just... it just tore me up.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.418
'Cause we were
in awe of them.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.629
They were, they were wearing
infantry badges, you know,

03:32.712 --> 03:33.796
the uniform.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.632
They had a star
on their jump wings.

03:35.715 --> 03:38.593
They, uh...

03:38.676 --> 03:41.179
They were like heroes
to us, you know?

03:41.262 --> 03:42.639
That's how we looked at them.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.307
And they were good.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.059
Furthermore,
they were good.

03:46.142 --> 03:48.144
We had good officers,
for the most part,

03:48.227 --> 03:49.896
But we had excellent NCOs.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.273
They looked,
they looked after you.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.584
(men chattering)

04:15.964 --> 04:19.801
All right, now,
Lieutenant, nice and easy.
We've still got a shot.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.344
(groaning)

04:21.427 --> 04:24.180
Tough break,
you're having
a tough night.

04:24.263 --> 04:25.640
People have
tough nights.

04:25.723 --> 04:26.891
Sorry, George.

04:25.723 --> 04:26.891
It's all right.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.019
Nice shot, sir.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.479
Thank you, Bull.

04:31.562 --> 04:32.855
Thank you,
Lieutenant.

04:32.939 --> 04:33.815
Finish me up.

04:33.898 --> 04:36.067
All right, Heff.
What does need?

04:36.150 --> 04:37.151
Double seven.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.320
Here he goes.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.697
(groaning)

04:39.404 --> 04:40.697
Hey, there it is!

04:40.780 --> 04:43.324
You're embarrassing
the Lieutenant, here.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.409
Have a drink.

04:44.492 --> 04:45.868
Oh, don't mind
if I do, Sarge.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.870
Better start
winning money soon,

04:47.954 --> 04:49.455
I think your buddies are
starting to miss you.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.457
Yeah, they do look
kind of sad, don't they?

04:51.541 --> 04:54.168
Randleman:
They're just serious
fighting men, that's all.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.629
Well, I think I'm gonna
go introduce myself.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.464
Careful what
you say now.

04:58.548 --> 05:01.050
Don't take much
to set my guys off.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.511
Yeah, and you got
some wild-eyed killers
right there, Bull.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.471
You know, it's a good thing
we weren't gambling.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.140
Oh, boy, we would've
gotten killed.

05:07.223 --> 05:08.599
Wanna bet?

05:07.223 --> 05:08.599
What?

05:08.683 --> 05:12.228
You wanna bet?

05:08.683 --> 05:12.228
No, I don't really know
much about gambling.

05:12.311 --> 05:13.312
Hey, come on.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.023
First one to hit
the bull's-eye?

05:15.106 --> 05:16.983
Yeah, one shot,
one shot.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.359
Yeah?
Make it two.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.736
Two packs.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.697
All right, two packs.
Here we go, one shot.
Here we go.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.657
Hey, fellas.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.701
What do you hear?
What do you say?

05:26.784 --> 05:28.703
Actually, that's Babe's seat,
Private Heffron's.

05:28.786 --> 05:29.829
Is that right?

05:29.912 --> 05:32.290
I don't care if
it's fucking Eisenhower's.

05:37.378 --> 05:38.671
Who are you?

05:38.755 --> 05:40.923
Private Miller,
James Miller.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.342
I'm in
Sergeant Randleman's squad.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.969
Us too,
I'm Les Hashey.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.764
Tony...

05:45.053 --> 05:47.764
Garcia, I know
who you are.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.058
Old gonorrhea
don't miss nothing.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.437
Lieutenant, are you gonna
shoot lefty all night?

05:54.520 --> 05:55.480
Hey, come on.

05:55.563 --> 05:56.939
Just curious 'cause
he's right-handed.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.942
George, what would I do
without, George Luz?

06:00.026 --> 06:00.985
Boop!

06:01.069 --> 06:02.153
Ooh!

06:02.236 --> 06:03.196
Goodness gracious.

06:03.279 --> 06:04.405
Two packs,
gentlemen.

06:04.489 --> 06:05.698
I know you
got 'em, pay up.

06:05.782 --> 06:09.494
So, Heffron tell you
about Doris yet?

06:09.577 --> 06:11.662
No.

06:09.577 --> 06:11.662
No?

06:11.746 --> 06:14.916
Well, then I'm gonna
educate you.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.709
We're getting ready
to get on a plane

06:16.793 --> 06:19.003
for that first Frog town
we never jumped into.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.130
All of a sudden, Heffron
stops dead in his tracks.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.423
Bing and a bang
and a boom,

06:22.507 --> 06:23.716
Everybody banging
into each other,

06:23.800 --> 06:26.636
Heffron's just starin' up
at the nose of the plane

06:26.719 --> 06:30.640
because on it is painted
this beautiful pinup.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.726
And written underneath
"Darling Doris."

06:33.810 --> 06:37.313
Doris, which just happens
to be the name of the skirt

06:37.396 --> 06:40.775
who just that day, sent Babe
one of them letters.

06:40.858 --> 06:42.026
You know the...

06:42.110 --> 06:45.279
Web, what do you call them
letters that the broads send?

06:45.363 --> 06:46.739
Uh, "Dear John" letter.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.950
That's it,
a "Dear Babe" letter.

06:49.033 --> 06:53.663
Well, anyway, lucky for Babe,
Patton overruns our drop zone.

06:53.746 --> 06:56.290
Mission canceled,
in other words,

06:56.374 --> 06:58.668
Babe don't have to risk
getting inside
old Doris again.

06:58.751 --> 06:59.836
Hah!

07:02.171 --> 07:04.340
Hey, Bull, your squad
listens up real good.

07:04.423 --> 07:07.760
Yeah, they're being polite
like whenever Bull opens
his mouth.

07:09.387 --> 07:10.513
Johnny, what are
you saying?

07:10.596 --> 07:12.181
Bull's boys are
just humoring him?

07:12.265 --> 07:14.517
Yeah, like whenever
he gives out some
of his folksy wisdom

07:14.600 --> 07:16.310
from back down
on the farm.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.104
Probably think
he's a fucking hayseed.

07:18.187 --> 07:19.480
Ain't that right?

07:21.816 --> 07:23.860
What are you
laughing at?

07:32.243 --> 07:35.663
You new boys,
you pay attention
to Sergeant Randleman.

07:35.746 --> 07:37.456
Got that?

07:37.540 --> 07:40.042
That's the smartest man
in the company.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.342
Hey, Mac.

07:50.386 --> 07:52.054
Where'd you get that?

07:52.138 --> 07:54.557
It's a Presidential
Distinguished Unit Citation.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.225
For, uh...

07:56.309 --> 07:58.686
For what the regiment
did in Normandy.

07:58.769 --> 08:01.981
That's right,
for what the regiment did.

08:02.064 --> 08:03.691
You weren't there.

08:03.774 --> 08:06.402
Hey, hey,
ease up, Cobb, mmm?

08:06.485 --> 08:08.446
It's a unit citation.

08:46.484 --> 08:47.944
Shit, Cobb.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.905
You didn't fight
in Normandy neither.

08:55.326 --> 08:59.121
I got hit in the plane
before I got a chance to jump.

09:00.539 --> 09:02.917
Hey, y'all,
listen up.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.544
I got us
an announcement to make.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.464
This here is
Carwood Lipton.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.424
He's already married,
Smokey.

This here is
Carwood Lipton,

09:12.885 --> 09:16.305
the new Easy Company
first sergeant.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.266

09:18.349 --> 09:21.018
As befitting
this position,

09:21.102 --> 09:23.729
he says he has to make
an announcement.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.650
Well, hate to break
the mood here, boys,

09:27.733 --> 09:31.028

we're moving out again.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.803
As you can see...

09:55.886 --> 09:58.931
this is called
Operation Market Garden.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.725
In terms of airborne
divisions involved,

10:00.808 --> 10:03.102
this one's even
bigger than Normandy.

10:03.185 --> 10:05.938
We're dropping deep
into occupied Holland.

10:06.022 --> 10:09.483
The Allied objective is
to take this road here,

10:09.567 --> 10:11.444
between Eindhoven
and Arnhem,

10:11.527 --> 10:14.238
so, that two British armored
divisions can move up it

10:14.322 --> 10:15.489
toward Arnhem.

10:15.573 --> 10:18.951
Our job is gonna be
to liberate Eindhoven.

10:19.035 --> 10:22.705

The entire European advance
has been put on hold

10:28.252 --> 10:31.380
to allocate resources
for this operation.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.757
It's Montgomery's
personal plan,

10:32.840 --> 10:34.383
we'll be under
British command.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.386
The good news is,
if this works,

10:37.470 --> 10:40.389
these tanks will be over
the Rhine and into Germany.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.559
It could end the war
and get us home by Christmas.

10:43.642 --> 10:45.311

10:45.394 --> 10:46.395

10:46.479 --> 10:48.314
Intelligence doesn't
expect much opposition.

10:48.397 --> 10:52.193
They think the Krauts
in Holland are mostly
kids and old men.

10:52.276 --> 10:54.445
And we should
take 'em by surprise.

10:54.528 --> 10:56.113
In any case,
say goodbye to England.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.449
I don't think they're
gonna call this one off.
