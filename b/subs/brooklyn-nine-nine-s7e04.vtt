00:04.546 --> 00:06.674
Jake, will you join me

00:04.546 --> 00:06.674
in Terry's office?

00:06.715 --> 00:08.467
Oh, private rendezvous, huh?

00:08.509 --> 00:09.969
This whole "trying

00:08.509 --> 00:09.969
to make a baby" thing

00:10.010 --> 00:11.887
has got you super freak--

00:10.010 --> 00:11.887
Hey, Terry!

00:11.929 --> 00:14.264
-What's up, dude?

00:11.929 --> 00:14.264
-What did you think

00:11.929 --> 00:14.264
was happening?

00:14.306 --> 00:16.767
He clearly thought

00:14.306 --> 00:16.767
you were gonna have

00:14.306 --> 00:16.767
secret sex in here.

00:16.809 --> 00:18.853
[scoffs] What?!

00:16.809 --> 00:18.853
Inappropes, much?

00:18.894 --> 00:20.813
I did not think that.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.813
Amy did.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.439
She texted me about it.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.439
See? Proof.

00:22.481 --> 00:23.607
Anyway, what's up,

00:22.481 --> 00:23.607
Lieutenant?

00:23.649 --> 00:25.108
Santiago and I are going

00:25.150 --> 00:27.194
to an administration workshop

00:25.150 --> 00:27.194
for the NYPD.

00:27.235 --> 00:28.737
And it's voluntary,

00:28.779 --> 00:30.155
so only the cool kids

00:28.779 --> 00:30.155
are gonna be there.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.699
I love you so much.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.699
Continue.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.283
Anyways, you're in charge

00:31.740 --> 00:33.283
for the day.

00:33.325 --> 00:35.118
Oh, boy.

00:33.325 --> 00:35.118
Here comes the lecture.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.912
"Be responsible, Jake. Don't do

00:35.160 --> 00:36.912
anything crazy or fun."

00:36.954 --> 00:38.747
There's no lecture.

00:36.954 --> 00:38.747
I trust you.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.541
Oh. But there always

00:38.789 --> 00:40.541
<i>used</i> to be a lecture.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.376
Yeah, well,

00:40.582 --> 00:42.376
you're not the same

00:42.417 --> 00:44.252
immature, rebellious kid

00:42.417 --> 00:44.252
you used to be.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.587
Didn't you and Amy just buy

00:45.629 --> 00:47.506
a family-friendly

00:45.629 --> 00:47.506
mid-size sedan?

00:47.548 --> 00:50.258
In a rebellious color,

00:47.548 --> 00:50.258
champagne, which is an alcohol.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.386
And let's not forget,

00:50.300 --> 00:52.386
I wanted to have sex

00:50.300 --> 00:52.386
in your office just now.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.346
Yeah, to have a baby

00:52.427 --> 00:54.346
and become a father!

00:54.388 --> 00:55.931
Ahh. He turned it around

00:54.388 --> 00:55.931
on me.

00:55.973 --> 00:57.516
It's not bad

00:55.973 --> 00:57.516
that I trust you more now.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.434
Plus, there's not even

00:57.558 --> 00:59.434
that much

00:59.476 --> 01:00.978
for you guys to do today.

01:01.020 --> 01:02.771
I mean, the squad

01:01.020 --> 01:02.771
is on reserve parade duty.

01:02.813 --> 01:04.272
-Your job is to sit around.

01:02.813 --> 01:04.272
-[Jake] Good point.

01:04.314 --> 01:05.774
Besides, what's the worst thing

01:05.816 --> 01:07.568
a responsible guy like me

01:05.816 --> 01:07.568
could do?

01:07.609 --> 01:09.403
Buckle your butts, everyone!

01:09.444 --> 01:11.030
The Jimmy Jab Games

01:09.444 --> 01:11.030
are back!

01:11.071 --> 01:13.281
[theme song playing]

01:31.508 --> 01:33.594
Squad, today we write

01:31.508 --> 01:33.594
a new chapter

01:33.635 --> 01:35.220
in the history

01:33.635 --> 01:35.220
of the Nine-Nine.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.430
And that chapter begins

01:35.262 --> 01:36.430
with the word "Jimmy,"

01:36.471 --> 01:37.765
and ends with the word "Jab."

01:37.806 --> 01:39.266
That chapter's

01:37.806 --> 01:39.266
only two words long.

01:39.307 --> 01:40.809
No, there's a lot of words

01:39.307 --> 01:40.809
in between.

01:40.851 --> 01:42.310
It's a long chapter.

01:40.851 --> 01:42.310
The point is,

01:42.352 --> 01:44.063
today we compete against

01:42.352 --> 01:44.063
one another

01:44.103 --> 01:46.273
in a series of games,

01:44.103 --> 01:46.273
and this year's winner receives

01:46.314 --> 01:49.443
one day's paid vacation,

01:46.314 --> 01:49.443
courtesy of Officer Mark.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.319
You said you needed that day

01:49.484 --> 01:51.319
for a private matter.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.530
You know what?

01:51.361 --> 01:53.530
You shouldn't even be here.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.198
Everyone say,

01:53.572 --> 01:55.198
"Thank you, Officer Mark.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.198
Bye, Officer Mark."

01:55.240 --> 01:57.492
[all] Thank you, Officer Mark.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.492
Bye, Officer Mark.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.828
-Now, who's ready to compete?

01:57.534 --> 01:59.828
-[Holt] Count me in.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.038
I could really use this day off

02:01.080 --> 02:02.414
to spend some time

02:01.080 --> 02:02.414
with my husband.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.332
Oh, please.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.332
We all have loved ones.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.542
You're not getting any sympathy

02:04.374 --> 02:05.542
just because you're gay.

02:05.584 --> 02:06.835
Rosa, I don't think he was--

02:06.877 --> 02:08.796
No, I was.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.796
She saw right through me.

02:08.837 --> 02:12.132
Nevertheless,

02:08.837 --> 02:12.132
I will destroy you all.

02:12.173 --> 02:13.675
[Jake] Copy that.

02:12.173 --> 02:13.675
I love your intensity.

02:13.717 --> 02:15.510
Now, Gina is gone,

02:13.717 --> 02:15.510
so we're out of a host.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.638
Me! Please, me.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.638
It's my time to shine.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.389
It's my<i> Greatest Showman</i>

02:17.679 --> 02:19.389
moment.

02:19.431 --> 02:21.016
Charles, you can't.

02:21.058 --> 02:22.350
You know who else

02:21.058 --> 02:22.350
they told "You can't"?

02:22.392 --> 02:23.769
Lettie Lutz, the bearded lady.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.855
But then,

02:23.811 --> 02:26.855
Mr. Barnum gave her a stage.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.231
Give me my stage, Jacob.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.608
Wait, so

02:28.273 --> 02:29.608
you're the bearded lady?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.819
No! I'm Barnum,

02:29.650 --> 02:31.819
you're Zac Efron,

02:31.860 --> 02:33.528
and everyone else

02:31.860 --> 02:33.528
is one of my freaks.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.363
Look, I would love

02:33.570 --> 02:35.363
to give you the hosting duties

02:35.405 --> 02:36.865
so you can work through

02:35.405 --> 02:36.865
whatever weird fantasy this is,

02:36.907 --> 02:38.199
but we need

02:36.907 --> 02:38.199
at least six players,

02:38.241 --> 02:39.660
and the host can't play.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.411
Then I'll find someone

02:39.701 --> 02:41.411
to replace me.

02:41.453 --> 02:43.872
I promise you will have

02:41.453 --> 02:43.872
your circus, Mr. Barnum.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.457
I thought<i> you</i> were Barnum.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.417
No! I'm the greatest showman!

02:48.251 --> 02:50.004
Isn't that Barnum?

02:50.045 --> 02:52.631
Debbie. Ah,

02:50.045 --> 02:52.631
just who I was looking for.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.675
Oh, no. Am I in your seat?

02:52.673 --> 02:54.675
I'll sit on the floor.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.927
Wh-what? No.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.927
No, don't do that.

02:56.969 --> 02:58.303
No, I was just wondering

02:58.345 --> 02:59.805
if you would like

02:58.345 --> 02:59.805
to take my place

02:59.847 --> 03:01.431
in a little

02:59.847 --> 03:01.431
squad competition today.

03:01.473 --> 03:04.225
Mm. I can't do competitions.

03:01.473 --> 03:04.225
I'm anti-dexterous.

03:04.267 --> 03:07.186
-Hmm?

03:04.267 --> 03:07.186
-It's when neither hand

03:04.267 --> 03:07.186
is good at anything.

03:07.228 --> 03:09.690
Oh, Debbie.

03:09.731 --> 03:11.190
I was once like you.

03:11.232 --> 03:13.902
A bashful beat cop

03:11.232 --> 03:13.902
with long, curly hair

03:13.944 --> 03:15.654
and no confidence at all.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.281
That's impossible.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.281
You're so suave.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.533
Sure, now I am.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.118
But I came a long way,

03:21.160 --> 03:23.704
and I did it

03:21.160 --> 03:23.704
by challenging myself

03:23.745 --> 03:25.831
to do things

03:23.745 --> 03:25.831
I never thought I could.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.666
This is your chance

03:25.873 --> 03:27.666
to find that confidence.

03:27.708 --> 03:28.917
I don't know.

03:28.959 --> 03:31.586
Debbie... trust me.

03:32.420 --> 03:33.797
OK.

03:33.839 --> 03:36.466
But only because

03:33.839 --> 03:36.466
I trust everyone.

03:36.508 --> 03:39.469
So, Diaz, I've never been

03:36.508 --> 03:39.469
more excited.

03:39.511 --> 03:42.514
My first time

03:39.511 --> 03:42.514
playing the Jimmy Jabs,

03:39.511 --> 03:42.514
and I'm destined to win.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.975
Look at my competition:

03:42.556 --> 03:44.975
Little Miss Hay For Brains.

03:45.017 --> 03:46.101
The Hay Brains,

03:46.143 --> 03:48.020
and King Brain Made of Hay.

03:48.062 --> 03:50.105
Well, you're forgetting

03:48.062 --> 03:50.105
about me. I'm also

03:48.062 --> 03:50.105
your competition.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.399
Yes, but you don't normally

03:50.147 --> 03:52.399
care about games like these.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.275
Well, I do care

03:52.440 --> 03:54.275
about this game.

03:54.317 --> 03:57.196
And you're gonna lose, because

03:54.317 --> 03:57.196
my brains aren't made of hay.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.198
My brains are made of brains.

04:00.199 --> 04:01.909
Oh, ho.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.744
The perfect retort.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.913
[Jake] Gather up,

04:03.785 --> 04:05.913
it's Jimmy Jab time!

04:05.954 --> 04:08.040
Ooh. Are you doing

04:05.954 --> 04:08.040
opening ceremonies?

04:08.082 --> 04:09.416
Yeah, and you might

04:08.082 --> 04:09.416
wanna leave

04:09.457 --> 04:10.709
before things get too crazy.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.335
A little plausible deniability.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.962
Actually, I wanna record 'em.

04:14.004 --> 04:15.672
Maybe you can teach

04:14.004 --> 04:15.672
other precincts

04:15.714 --> 04:17.507
how to throw their own versions

04:15.714 --> 04:17.507
to boost morale.

04:17.549 --> 04:19.634
No, I'm not a teacher.

04:17.549 --> 04:19.634
I'm a class clown-slash-bad boy

04:19.676 --> 04:20.844
with a heart of gold. Whatever.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.387
Charles, just start!

04:22.429 --> 04:24.890
Ladies and gentlemen!

04:24.932 --> 04:27.226
The moment

04:24.932 --> 04:27.226
you've been waiting for.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.936
Wow, he went full "Showman."

04:28.977 --> 04:31.521
I present to you

04:28.977 --> 04:31.521
six freaks who,

04:31.563 --> 04:33.690
through a series

04:31.563 --> 04:33.690
of elaborate games,

04:33.732 --> 04:35.901
Will be eliminated one by one,

04:35.943 --> 04:38.319
until a champion is crowned.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.739
And that champion shall...

04:40.781 --> 04:42.365
inherit my circus.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.367
-And get a day off.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.367
-I was getting there, Ro-Ro.

04:44.409 --> 04:45.702
-Let me have my fun.

04:44.409 --> 04:45.702
-Yeah, Ro-Ro,

04:45.744 --> 04:46.870
let him have his fun.

04:46.912 --> 04:49.039
As always, we start the games

04:49.081 --> 04:52.918
by lighting the ceremonial

04:49.081 --> 04:52.918
Bagel of Destiny.

04:52.960 --> 04:56.880
Ah, it's actually

04:52.960 --> 04:56.880
the Baguette of Destiny

04:56.922 --> 04:59.883
because this year, we're

04:56.922 --> 04:59.883
throwing caution to the wind.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.843
Charles, flame me.

in front of all of us.

05:24.158 --> 05:25.909
-Yeah.

05:24.158 --> 05:25.909
-[Hitchcock] Peralta,

05:25.951 --> 05:27.286
how about we make these games

05:25.951 --> 05:27.286
a little more exciting

05:27.327 --> 05:28.870
-with a wager?

05:27.327 --> 05:28.870
-Ooh, interesting.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.371
-What'd you have in mind?

05:28.912 --> 05:30.371
-If you win,

05:30.413 --> 05:31.873
I'll do your paperwork

05:30.413 --> 05:31.873
for a year.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.500
-Go on.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.500
-If I win, I get your new car.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.002
[scoffs]

05:33.541 --> 05:35.002
You're joking, right?

05:35.043 --> 05:36.795
Why? Because

05:35.043 --> 05:36.795
you can't imagine

05:36.837 --> 05:38.964
someone bitchin' like me

05:36.837 --> 05:38.964
driving a lame family sedan?

05:39.006 --> 05:41.300
No, because Jake

05:39.006 --> 05:41.300
would never bet our car.

05:41.340 --> 05:44.219
Yeah, I would never do that.

05:41.340 --> 05:44.219
But also, it's not lame.

05:44.261 --> 05:45.720
It's the color of an alcohol.

05:44.261 --> 05:45.720
Everyone's talking about it.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.889
No, Jake,

05:45.762 --> 05:47.889
it's a super lame car,

05:47.931 --> 05:50.017
but I don't mind.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.017
My ex-stepson kicked

05:47.931 --> 05:50.017
me out of the house,

05:50.058 --> 05:51.893
and I need a place to crash

05:50.058 --> 05:51.893
with air conditioning.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.478
Look, the bet

05:51.935 --> 05:53.478
is not happening.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.522
Sorry, Amy, but this

05:53.520 --> 05:55.522
is between Jake and me.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.149
Dude, what happened

05:55.563 --> 05:57.149
to the cool guy

05:57.191 --> 05:59.193
that liked to make fun bets

05:57.191 --> 05:59.193
with his best bud?

05:59.234 --> 06:01.028
[Amy]

05:59.234 --> 06:01.028
OK, Hitchcock, drop it.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.988
Jake doesn't do

06:01.069 --> 06:02.988
that kind of thing anymore.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.823
-He's an adult now.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.823
-Hitchcock, you're on!

06:04.865 --> 06:06.158
-He is?

06:04.865 --> 06:06.158
-I am?

06:06.200 --> 06:08.451
I don't know. Yes!

06:06.200 --> 06:08.451
Yes, you are.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.911
[Boyle]

06:08.493 --> 06:09.911
Damn it, my pants!

06:09.953 --> 06:12.122
Sorry, everyone.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.122
Look away, look away.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.456
Oh, damn.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.791
Wow, who knew?

06:14.833 --> 06:17.169
He really is

06:14.833 --> 06:17.169
the greatest showman.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.798
What the hell are you doing?

06:21.840 --> 06:23.466
Why did you just bet

06:21.840 --> 06:23.466
our new car?

06:23.508 --> 06:25.760
Because it's fun.

06:23.508 --> 06:25.760
And because it's who I am.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.346
I mean, remember

06:25.802 --> 06:27.346
all those crazy bets

06:25.802 --> 06:27.346
we used to make

06:27.386 --> 06:28.429
when you were

06:27.386 --> 06:28.429
falling in love with me?

06:28.471 --> 06:30.057
I remember the bets we made

06:30.098 --> 06:31.558
when I found you obnoxious

06:30.098 --> 06:31.558
and difficult to be around.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.810
Yes, those bets.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.810
See? You remember.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.812
-This is just like that.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.812
-Hey, Santiago, it's time

06:33.852 --> 06:35.812
to head out.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.273
Actually, I'm not leaving.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.273
I'm gonna stay for the games.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.317
Ohh, look who's coming

06:38.315 --> 06:40.317
around already.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.485
-We're gonna have fun.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.485
-No, this isn't fun.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.487
A voluntary administration

06:42.527 --> 06:44.487
workshop is fun.

06:44.529 --> 06:47.032
Yeah, I hear it

06:44.529 --> 06:47.032
ends with a six-page

06:44.529 --> 06:47.032
self-assessment.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.117
Oh, come on, Terry!

06:47.074 --> 06:49.117
You don't have to rub it in!

06:49.159 --> 06:51.410
Welcome to

06:49.159 --> 06:51.410
the first competition.

06:51.452 --> 06:54.915
Which one of you

06:51.452 --> 06:54.915
will "meat" your maker?

06:54.956 --> 06:57.667
Be sure not to "fowl" out,

06:57.709 --> 06:59.794
or you will "meat" your end.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.880
We don't know

06:59.836 --> 07:01.880
what the game is,

06:59.836 --> 07:01.880
so these puns don't work.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.840
It's a meat-throwing

07:01.922 --> 07:03.840
challenge.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.927
All of the expired cold cuts

07:03.882 --> 07:06.927
from the kitchen refrigerator

07:06.968 --> 07:09.137
are under this tarp.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.555
Voila!

07:10.597 --> 07:13.141
You will toss

07:10.597 --> 07:13.141
a meat of your choosing

07:13.183 --> 07:16.728
at the break room window

07:13.183 --> 07:16.728
from ten feet away!

07:16.770 --> 07:19.022
If it sticks to the glass,

07:16.770 --> 07:19.022
well, then you move on.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.941
-If it doesn't, then you're--

07:19.064 --> 07:20.941
-Cold cut?

07:20.982 --> 07:22.943
Yes, now you're getting it.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.943
Thank you, Rosa.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.280
-Hyah!

07:24.152 --> 07:26.280
-Jake sticks it!

07:26.321 --> 07:29.532
Amy sticks it!

07:26.321 --> 07:29.532
Scully sticks it.

07:29.574 --> 07:32.286
Hitchcock sticks it.

07:32.327 --> 07:34.162
Holt old-school sticks it!

07:34.204 --> 07:35.330
Ro-Ro sticks it.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.040
Debbie--where's Debbie?

07:38.875 --> 07:41.502
I can't do this, Charles.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.502
I didn't even grab a meat.

07:41.544 --> 07:44.881
I'm not some expert

07:41.544 --> 07:44.881
cold cut-thrower

07:41.544 --> 07:44.881
like all of you.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.759
Everyone, I need a second

07:44.923 --> 07:47.759
for a freak in trouble.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.137
Debbie, I once stood here

07:47.801 --> 07:50.137
in front of this squad

07:50.178 --> 07:51.805
-and felt like I didn't belong.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.805
-But--

07:51.846 --> 07:53.014
But nothing.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.014
This is your chance

07:53.056 --> 07:54.141
to do something great.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.350
Debbie, this is your moment.

07:55.392 --> 07:58.561
Take it, and stick this meat.

07:59.438 --> 08:00.730
-Is this turkey?

07:59.438 --> 08:00.730
-Yes.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.441
I'm very allergic to turkey.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.817
[shouting and crashing]

08:03.858 --> 08:05.277
-Hold her down!

08:03.858 --> 08:05.277
-Ahh!

08:05.319 --> 08:06.527
[screams]

08:06.569 --> 08:08.447
So Debbie's out.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.824
But she'll be fine,

08:08.488 --> 08:10.824
thanks to her purse

08:08.488 --> 08:10.824
full of EpiPens.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.993
And now, that brings us

08:10.865 --> 08:12.993
to the end of round one,

08:13.034 --> 08:16.455
which mean it is time

08:13.034 --> 08:16.455
for another song.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.706
♪<i> It was the meat</i>

08:16.496 --> 08:18.706
<i>Of the moment</i> ♪

08:18.748 --> 08:21.084

08:18.748 --> 08:21.084

08:23.295 --> 08:25.005
<i>Window, window ♪</i>

08:25.046 --> 08:27.048
So I bet you're wondering

08:25.046 --> 08:27.048
how I did so well

08:27.090 --> 08:29.343
-in that last competition.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.343
-Actually, I<i> was</i> impressed

08:29.384 --> 08:30.760
you didn't eat any of the meat.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.262
Well, I don't deserve

08:30.802 --> 08:32.262
all the credit.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.513
Scully, show 'em

08:32.304 --> 08:33.513
what we're working with.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.640
This is Dorothy,

08:33.554 --> 08:35.640
my pill box.

08:37.309 --> 08:38.643
Good God.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.479
My friend here has dozens

08:38.685 --> 08:40.479
of medications

08:40.520 --> 08:41.813
prescribed for all

08:40.520 --> 08:41.813
of his ailments.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.064
They make him normal.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.607
They make me limitless.

08:44.649 --> 08:47.402
This blood thinner

08:44.649 --> 08:47.402
can suppress appetite.

08:47.444 --> 08:50.155
This eczema pill can cause

08:47.444 --> 08:50.155
extreme muscle spasms.

08:50.197 --> 08:53.367
Which is pretty inconvenient,

08:50.197 --> 08:53.367
unless you need to hurl meat

08:50.197 --> 08:53.367
across a room.

08:53.408 --> 08:55.869
My God. He's doping.

08:55.910 --> 08:58.455
Welcome to the big leagues.

08:58.497 --> 08:59.789
Well, looks like things

08:59.831 --> 09:01.416
just got

08:59.831 --> 09:01.416
a little more interesting.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.043
No, they got worse.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.253
Amy, it's like Torrance

09:03.084 --> 09:05.253
from<i> Bring It On</i> says,

09:05.295 --> 09:07.255
"You'll never be the best

09:05.295 --> 09:07.255
until you win against

09:05.295 --> 09:07.255
the best."

09:07.297 --> 09:09.508
-Didn't they lose in the end?

09:07.297 --> 09:09.508
-Yeah, but this is different.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.718
Hitchcock isn't nearly as good

09:09.549 --> 09:11.718
as the East Compton Clovers.

09:11.759 --> 09:14.388
[laughs] It's like,

09:11.759 --> 09:14.388
where's your head at?

09:14.429 --> 09:16.264
It's gonna be fine.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.264
It might not be fine.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.392
Diaz, congratulations

09:16.306 --> 09:18.392
on moving on

09:18.433 --> 09:21.102
to the second round--

09:18.433 --> 09:21.102
said I, sarcastically.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.603
Oh, you're still in this?

09:22.645 --> 09:25.106
I knew a uniformed officer

09:22.645 --> 09:25.106
had been eliminated,

09:25.148 --> 09:26.816
I just couldn't remember

09:25.148 --> 09:26.816
which one.

09:26.858 --> 09:29.194
OK, we're both great

09:26.858 --> 09:29.194
at insults. Let's move on.

09:29.236 --> 09:32.280
Tell me, why do you wanna

09:29.236 --> 09:32.280
win this game so badly?

09:32.322 --> 09:35.325
Honestly...

09:32.322 --> 09:35.325
I guess I still feel like

09:35.367 --> 09:38.078
my parents don't accept

09:35.367 --> 09:38.078
my sexuality.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.871
And winning this

09:38.119 --> 09:39.871
will let me prove to myself

09:39.913 --> 09:42.374
that as long as I feel good

09:39.913 --> 09:42.374
about who I am,

09:42.416 --> 09:44.292
that's all that matters.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.627
That's a load of dung.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.755
You processed that

09:46.669 --> 09:48.755
parent stuff a year ago.

09:48.796 --> 09:51.091
You're right, we're going

09:48.796 --> 09:51.091
to drag brunch this Sunday.

09:51.132 --> 09:55.429
No. There's something private

09:51.132 --> 09:55.429
that is fueling you.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.097
And when I find

09:55.470 --> 09:57.097
that private fuel,

09:57.138 --> 09:59.516
I will extract it

09:57.138 --> 09:59.516
to use as my private fuel

09:59.558 --> 10:00.934
in my private fuel tank.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.311
Then I will have a full tank

10:00.975 --> 10:03.311
of private fuel,

10:03.353 --> 10:06.481
and you will have an empty tank

10:03.353 --> 10:06.481
of private--

10:06.523 --> 10:07.648
Rosa.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.734
Welcome to K-9 Hide-and-Seek.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.986
You'll be given

10:09.776 --> 10:11.986
five minutes to hide,

10:12.028 --> 10:13.863
during which time

10:12.028 --> 10:13.863
Officer Frisbee

10:13.905 --> 10:14.989
will be learning your scent.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.699
Whoever he finds first is out.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.785
-How'd you get our clothes?

10:16.741 --> 10:18.785
-Doesn't matter.

10:18.826 --> 10:22.705
Now, hide, freaks!

10:18.826 --> 10:22.705
Hide from the society

10:18.826 --> 10:22.705
that shunned you!

10:25.750 --> 10:27.627
What? Why aren't you hiding?

10:25.750 --> 10:27.627
Are you quitting?

10:27.668 --> 10:29.421
Oh, no, quite the opposite.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.756
This little guy keeps

10:29.463 --> 10:31.756
Scully's liver from imploding,

10:31.798 --> 10:33.216
but it has a neat side effect.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.093
It also masks your natural odor

10:35.135 --> 10:36.844
and makes you smell

10:35.135 --> 10:36.844
like a dead fish.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.930
-[Amy] Ew.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.930
-Who's got two stinky thumbs

10:38.972 --> 10:40.807
that stink like rotten salmon?

10:40.848 --> 10:43.518
-This stinky guy.

10:40.848 --> 10:43.518
-You suck.

10:43.560 --> 10:47.397
Ready or not,

10:43.560 --> 10:47.397
here comes my hell hound!

10:52.360 --> 10:54.529
[dog sniffing]

11:01.244 --> 11:02.287
I'm a mop.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.788
-[barking]

11:02.329 --> 11:03.788
-Shh.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.625
The flattop

11:03.830 --> 11:06.625
has left the big top.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.293
Uh, wait, where's Jake?

11:08.335 --> 11:09.752
[Amy] Well, there's a TV cart

11:09.794 --> 11:11.212
suspiciously in the middle

11:09.794 --> 11:11.212
of the room,

11:11.254 --> 11:13.006
that ceiling tile's

11:11.254 --> 11:13.006
out of place,

11:13.047 --> 11:14.549
and he said he was going

11:13.047 --> 11:14.549
to hide somewhere reckless,

11:14.591 --> 11:16.301
so I'm guessing he's up there.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.677
That's right, Amy.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.677
I'm in the ceiling.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.847
Unlike you boring old fogies,

11:20.888 --> 11:22.223
I found the craziest--

11:22.265 --> 11:24.725
-[Jake] Uhhh!

11:22.265 --> 11:24.725
-[all gasp]

11:24.767 --> 11:26.102
[groans]

11:26.144 --> 11:27.895
Don't worry.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.565
My bones and ribs

11:27.937 --> 11:30.565
broke my fall.

11:32.775 --> 11:35.612
Time for our next competition:

11:32.775 --> 11:35.612
The Hellevator.

11:35.654 --> 11:39.407
You see, normally, our elevator

11:35.654 --> 11:39.407
can hold up to 12 freaks.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.284
But what if it's filled

11:39.449 --> 11:41.284
with boxes,

11:41.326 --> 11:42.869
and those freaks

11:41.326 --> 11:42.869
are wearing bomb suits?

11:42.910 --> 11:45.330
Well then,

11:42.910 --> 11:45.330
its capacity drops to four.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.916
"Oh, but Mr. Barnum,

11:45.372 --> 11:48.916
there are five freaks here.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.669
Whatever shall we do?"

11:50.709 --> 11:53.796
That's the twist. You have

11:50.709 --> 11:53.796
to fight for your spot.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.840
And once those

11:53.838 --> 11:55.840
elevator doors close,

11:55.882 --> 11:57.676
one of you will be out!

11:57.716 --> 12:01.596
Oh, did I mention,

11:57.716 --> 12:01.596
you have to do it

11:57.716 --> 12:01.596
all in bomb suits?

12:01.638 --> 12:03.473
Yes, that was one of

12:01.638 --> 12:03.473
the first things you mentioned.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.933
Oh, sorry.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.933
I was thinking

12:03.515 --> 12:05.933
of my next song.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.436
Anyway, suit up, freaks!

12:08.478 --> 12:10.480
[Jake groaning]

12:10.522 --> 12:12.482
You're pretty hurt, huh?

12:12.524 --> 12:13.983
Yeah, it's very exciting.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.610
I'm the underdog now,

12:14.025 --> 12:15.610
like Seabiscuit.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.111
I mean, sure,

12:15.652 --> 12:17.111
I can't lift my arms,

12:17.153 --> 12:18.863
but Seabiscuit won

12:17.153 --> 12:18.863
without even having arms.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.948
-What are you talking about?

12:18.905 --> 12:20.948
-I don't know. I fell.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.492
We're already married.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.492
It doesn't matter.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.035
Well, you guys

12:22.534 --> 12:24.035
are in for a beating.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.495
What, is that some kind

12:24.077 --> 12:25.495
of kidney pill?

12:25.537 --> 12:26.745
It's to reduce

12:25.537 --> 12:26.745
my various swellings.

12:26.787 --> 12:28.415
Basically, it's just speed.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.166
-That's illegal, and--

12:28.456 --> 12:30.166
-Ack-ack-ack-ack!

12:30.208 --> 12:31.876
OK, here we go, everyone.

12:31.918 --> 12:35.296
The game begins

12:31.918 --> 12:35.296
when the elevator doors ding.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.924
Are you ready

12:35.338 --> 12:37.924
for the Hellevator?

12:37.965 --> 12:40.427
Buckle up.

12:37.965 --> 12:40.427
The juice is loose!

12:40.468 --> 12:41.595
[dings]

12:41.636 --> 12:44.347
I am Hitchcock!

12:41.636 --> 12:44.347
[grunts]

12:44.389 --> 12:45.724
What the [bleep]?

12:49.394 --> 12:50.853
[Amy]

12:49.394 --> 12:50.853
Jake? I'm in! Are you in?

12:50.895 --> 12:52.564
Amy, I'm not gonna make it!

12:52.606 --> 12:54.274
You just go for the day off.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.274
You've earned it.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.650
No, we're gonna lose the car!

12:55.692 --> 12:57.026
Oh, crap! Right, the car.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.528
Oh, no,

12:57.068 --> 12:58.528
we're gonna lose the car!

12:58.570 --> 13:01.864
-Hell no, we won't!

12:58.570 --> 13:01.864
-[both scream]

13:01.906 --> 13:03.199
You "Armageddoned" me.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.034
I don't know

13:03.241 --> 13:05.034
what that means.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.330
A lover sacrificed,

13:09.372 --> 13:11.249
and another lover reborn.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.710
These games truly

13:11.291 --> 13:13.710
have it all. And now,

13:13.752 --> 13:17.505
a quick intermission

13:13.752 --> 13:17.505
for one of my legendary

13:13.752 --> 13:17.505
costume changes.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.300
All right, come on, Charles.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.801
Quick change,

13:20.341 --> 13:22.801
no time for touch-ups.

13:22.843 --> 13:24.887
We're running long.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.805
-Ow!

13:24.929 --> 13:26.805
-[Boyle] Oh, Debbie.

13:26.847 --> 13:28.642
-Are you OK?

13:26.847 --> 13:28.642
-Yeah, I'm just recovering

13:28.683 --> 13:29.934
from the EpiPen.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.645
I'm sorry

13:29.976 --> 13:31.645
I messed everything up.

13:31.686 --> 13:33.730
I'm just not cut out

13:31.686 --> 13:33.730
for this high-stakes world

13:33.772 --> 13:35.482
-of having fun with friends.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.482
-First off,

13:35.523 --> 13:37.609
if you think you messed

13:35.523 --> 13:37.609
this up, you're crazy.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.902
Nothing can mess up

13:37.651 --> 13:39.902
the performance I'm

13:37.651 --> 13:39.902
putting on out there.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.447
Secondly, what you did today

13:39.944 --> 13:42.447
was incredible.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.575
I got disqualified

13:42.489 --> 13:45.575
immediately.

13:45.617 --> 13:49.329
Did I ever tell you the story

13:45.617 --> 13:49.329
of my Jimmy Jabs humiliation?

13:49.370 --> 13:51.956
No. You pretty much

13:49.370 --> 13:51.956
never talked to me

13:49.370 --> 13:51.956
till today.

13:51.998 --> 13:55.376
Well, it was 2009,

13:51.998 --> 13:55.376
it was the opening ceremonies,

13:55.418 --> 13:57.003
and I couldn't be more excited.

13:57.044 --> 13:58.837
I even got my hair styled

13:57.044 --> 13:58.837
just for the event.

13:58.879 --> 14:01.174
Charles, flame me.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.717
[screams]

14:02.759 --> 14:04.761
I was out before the games

14:02.759 --> 14:04.761
even began.

14:04.803 --> 14:07.681
But I wouldn't change

14:04.803 --> 14:07.681
that moment for the world

14:07.722 --> 14:11.267
because it made me realize

14:07.722 --> 14:11.267
that not even flames

14:11.309 --> 14:13.227
can grind me down to dust.

14:13.269 --> 14:16.648
There is a place for us,

14:13.269 --> 14:16.648
for we are glorious.

14:16.690 --> 14:20.401
-You<i> are</i> the bearded lady.

14:16.690 --> 14:20.401
-We are<i> all</i> the bearded lady.

14:20.443 --> 14:24.030
Now ask yourself: what have

14:20.443 --> 14:24.030
you always wanted to do,

14:20.443 --> 14:24.030
but were too scared to try?

14:24.071 --> 14:25.490
-Sing.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.490
-What?

14:25.532 --> 14:27.325
I want to sing

14:25.532 --> 14:27.325
in front of everyone.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.869
OK, little lady,

14:27.367 --> 14:29.869
you get that voice warmed up,

14:29.910 --> 14:32.539
because you are doing

14:29.910 --> 14:32.539
the closing ceremonies.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.624
I can't. I haven't prepared.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.292
I don't even know the song.

14:36.334 --> 14:38.961
Welcome to show business.

14:36.334 --> 14:38.961
It waits for no one.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.755
You're on in an hour.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.132
So, Diaz, I figured out

14:40.797 --> 14:43.132
why you want to win.

14:43.174 --> 14:45.677
-I hacked your work calendar.

14:43.174 --> 14:45.677
-Those calendars are public.

14:45.719 --> 14:46.969
Everyone on the system

14:45.719 --> 14:46.969
has access.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.596
I hacked it.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.596
I'm a hacker.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.724
Anyhow, you took

14:48.638 --> 14:50.724
a vacation 14 days ago,

14:50.765 --> 14:53.601
and yet, you already

14:50.765 --> 14:53.601
want another day off?

14:53.643 --> 14:57.188
Odd, unless you<i> need</i> it

14:53.643 --> 14:57.188
for a unique,

14:57.230 --> 14:59.023
once-in-a-lifetime occurrence.

14:59.065 --> 15:02.235
Perhaps a proposal

14:59.065 --> 15:02.235
to your girlfriend Jocelyn?

15:02.276 --> 15:04.070
-What?

15:02.276 --> 15:04.070
-You've been dating for a year,

15:04.111 --> 15:05.446
you met

15:04.111 --> 15:05.446
each other's parents,

15:05.488 --> 15:07.948
and you just got

15:05.488 --> 15:07.948
your nails done...

15:07.990 --> 15:10.577
to present her with a ring.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.621
-Jocelyn broke up with me.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.621
-What?

15:13.663 --> 15:15.248
I want the day off

15:13.663 --> 15:15.248
so I can sit alone,

15:15.289 --> 15:17.124
listen to death metal,

15:15.289 --> 15:17.124
and get my head right.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.126
But what about

15:17.166 --> 15:19.126
my nail polish solve?

15:19.168 --> 15:21.337
Getting my nails done

15:19.168 --> 15:21.337
made me feel better

15:19.168 --> 15:21.337
for a second.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.673
Ahh!

15:23.715 --> 15:25.258
This is a trick

15:23.715 --> 15:25.258
to throw me off.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.468
I bet things are

15:25.299 --> 15:27.468
better than ever and you--

15:27.510 --> 15:29.011
Oh.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.555
You really are crying.

15:30.597 --> 15:34.559
Welcome to my most

15:30.597 --> 15:34.559
sadistic creation.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.228
The tangled nightmare

15:34.601 --> 15:37.228
of extension cords

15:37.270 --> 15:39.230
that lives

15:37.270 --> 15:39.230
in our supply closet.

15:39.272 --> 15:43.693
Your mission is to untangle

15:39.272 --> 15:43.693
your lamp's cord, plug it in,

15:43.735 --> 15:46.696
and then pull yourself to it

15:43.735 --> 15:46.696
on your dolly and turn it on.

15:46.738 --> 15:49.240
Oh, nice. Hitchcock's

15:46.738 --> 15:49.240
coming down from the speed.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.118
-I have a chance.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.118
-Freaks... begin!

15:52.159 --> 15:54.287
[Jake grunts]

15:54.328 --> 15:56.623
-[grunting]

15:54.328 --> 15:56.623
-[Amy] Jake!

15:58.416 --> 16:00.501
-What is that?

15:58.416 --> 16:00.501
-Grab the top one

15:58.416 --> 16:00.501
and yank the bottom one!

16:00.543 --> 16:02.462
Oh, thank God

16:00.543 --> 16:02.462
that's what you meant.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.213
Although I'm open

16:02.503 --> 16:04.213
to whatever you wanna try.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.298
Here we go!

16:05.339 --> 16:07.300
Diaz, I want to apologize.

16:07.341 --> 16:08.760
I'm not talking to you.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.762
[grunts]

16:08.802 --> 16:10.762
Oh, oh, Amy, it worked!

16:10.804 --> 16:12.639
-The banging worked!

16:10.804 --> 16:12.639
-What? No!

16:12.680 --> 16:14.056
Here we go.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.349
Go.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.272
-Gotcha.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.272
-You're never gonna catch me.

16:21.314 --> 16:24.692
[Jake]

16:21.314 --> 16:24.692
Oh, yeah. Yes, I did it!

16:24.734 --> 16:26.068
And Hitchcock's gonna lose!

16:26.110 --> 16:27.695
Rosa and Holt

16:26.110 --> 16:27.695
are gonna beat him.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.447
[Holt]

16:27.737 --> 16:29.447
Rosa, stop. I give up.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.240
I want you to know

16:29.489 --> 16:31.240
I'm sorry for prying.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.326
Win this thing,

16:31.282 --> 16:33.326
and enjoy your day off.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.286
And if you ever want

16:33.367 --> 16:35.286
a friend to sit with you

16:35.328 --> 16:38.080
and silently listen
