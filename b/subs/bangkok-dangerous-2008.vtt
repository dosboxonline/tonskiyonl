01:24.463 --> 01:29.217
My job takes me to a lot of places.
It's got its downsides.

01:29.760 --> 01:33.096
I sleep alone. I eat alone.

01:33.180 --> 01:36.140
I'm used to it, though.

01:36.225 --> 01:38.977
I'd like to meet someone,

01:39.061 --> 01:42.146
but it's tough when you live out of a suitcase.

01:43.107 --> 01:46.901
I go where I'm told, do what I'm told.

01:47.820 --> 01:51.197
I shouldn't complain. The work is steady.

01:51.282 --> 01:53.324
The money's good.

01:53.409 --> 01:55.910
But it's not for everyone.

04:36.697 --> 04:39.616
My name's Joe.

04:40.993 --> 04:43.911
This is what I do.

05:31.543 --> 05:34.087
You're late.

05:34.171 --> 05:38.174
Sorry, Mr London.
They closed Chekhov Bridge.

05:47.935 --> 05:50.228
You're leaving?

05:51.272 --> 05:53.564
I need the phone.

06:03.158 --> 06:05.868
Um... I can help with the bags.

06:05.953 --> 06:08.329
No, I can handle it.

06:15.838 --> 06:20.550
If you ever come back, I can...
I can use the money. Do svidaniya.

06:21.594 --> 06:23.678
Goodbye.

06:41.530 --> 06:44.365
I was taught four rules.

06:44.450 --> 06:48.286
One - don't ask questions.

06:48.370 --> 06:51.581
There is no such thing as right and wrong.

06:51.665 --> 06:56.210
Two - don't take an interest
in people outside of work.

06:56.295 --> 06:58.671
There is no such thing as trust.

06:58.756 --> 07:02.175
Three - erase every trace.

07:02.259 --> 07:06.512
Come anonymous
and leave nothing behind.

07:06.597 --> 07:09.557
Four - know when to get out.

07:10.476 --> 07:13.853
Just thinking about it means it's time.

07:13.938 --> 07:18.149
Before you lose your edge.
Before you become a target.

07:35.793 --> 07:38.503
So you look for the right opportunity.

07:38.587 --> 07:41.047
Nothing too risky.

07:41.131 --> 07:43.841
Get the money and disappear forever.

07:45.636 --> 07:50.390
This is it. Four hits, one location.

07:50.474 --> 07:53.476
The last job.

07:55.020 --> 07:57.605
Purpose of your visit to Bangkok,
Mr Vincent?

07:57.690 --> 07:59.315
Holiday.

08:08.867 --> 08:13.913
Bangkok. It's corrupt, dirty and dense.

08:41.859 --> 08:45.278
All my clients have one thing in common.

08:45.362 --> 08:48.156
They feed off the people.

08:48.240 --> 08:50.950
There's big money in misery.

08:51.035 --> 08:53.911
Where there's money, there's competition.

08:53.996 --> 08:56.914
And the guy paying me usually wins.

09:35.412 --> 09:40.458
It always starts the same way.
Just like I was taught.

09:40.542 --> 09:46.172
Secure a safe location. Somewhere off
the beaten path where you have privacy.

09:46.257 --> 09:51.719
But you stay invisible too long, the human
race starts to look like another species.

09:51.804 --> 09:54.889
So you venture out, you observe,

09:54.974 --> 10:00.144
and then you return
to your invisible world, like a ghost.

10:13.993 --> 10:15.535
- Hey, Larry.
- Yeah?

10:15.619 --> 10:17.912
Check these out.

10:20.249 --> 10:22.333
- Check out these girls.
- What's up?

10:22.418 --> 10:25.545
Hello, gentlemen.
How are you? First time in Bangkok?

10:25.629 --> 10:28.965
Rolex? Good one. If you want.
Yeah, yeah. Look. Good Rolex.

10:29.049 --> 10:32.010
How much you want to bet
it's counterfeit?

10:32.094 --> 10:34.178
- 2,000. It looks good.
- No, thanks.

10:34.263 --> 10:39.100
No, no. No Rolex? Never mind. Never
mind. You want girls? I can get you girls.

10:39.184 --> 10:41.978
- How about boys? You like boys?
- No!

10:42.062 --> 10:46.357
You don't like boys, no?
Hey, how about you, huh, cowboy?

10:46.442 --> 10:49.235
5,000 baht, new-car smell,
satisfaction money back.

10:49.320 --> 10:54.073
Super-rubber-pussy guarantee. Whatever
happens in Bangkok stays in Bangkok.

10:54.158 --> 10:57.243
You wanna find garbage?
Go to a garbage dump.

10:57.328 --> 11:01.497
I look for three qualifications.
They have to speak a little English,

11:01.582 --> 11:06.628
they have to want to make money, and,
above all, they have to be disposable.

11:10.758 --> 11:12.800
You wanna make some money?

11:12.885 --> 11:16.554
I have work in town. I need some help.

11:17.431 --> 11:21.517
- What work?
- Pick things up, drop things off.

11:21.602 --> 11:24.479
Maybe some translation.

11:24.980 --> 11:28.149
About a month's work. 2,000 a day.

11:31.111 --> 11:33.988
- Dollars?
- Baht.

11:34.073 --> 11:35.865
Bullshit.

11:42.122 --> 11:46.626
5,000, huh? 4500?

11:46.710 --> 11:49.712
4,000.

11:49.797 --> 11:53.841
2,952.50. What do you say? Come on.

11:54.468 --> 11:59.097
We'll round up. 3,000.
You get paid at the end of the week.

11:59.181 --> 12:04.686
No deal. OK, OK. How about
half now, half at the end ofthe week?

12:07.898 --> 12:10.483
- What's your name?
- Kong.

12:11.068 --> 12:12.402
Kong?

12:17.241 --> 12:20.326
You can keep that in the wallet you stole.

12:22.121 --> 12:28.376
Be at 21 Sama Han Road tomorrow, 7pm.
You come alone, or you don't get paid.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.046
Yes, boss.

13:07.458 --> 13:09.917
- Take offthe shades.
- Huh?

13:10.461 --> 13:13.713
Glasses. Off.

13:19.970 --> 13:23.097
Keep that with you at all times.

13:23.182 --> 13:25.642
- I have good phone.
- Now you have two.

13:26.268 --> 13:32.982
You answer whenever it rings. If I call
and you don't answer, you don't get paid.

13:36.862 --> 13:40.406
Time is very important.

13:41.158 --> 13:47.830
If I tell you to be somewhere
and you are a minute late,

13:47.915 --> 13:50.291
you don't get paid.

13:50.376 --> 13:51.960
Do you understand?

13:52.044 --> 13:53.586
ln English.

13:53.671 --> 13:56.631
I understand!

13:56.715 --> 13:59.717
- You know the Caribbean Club?
- High-class ass.

13:59.802 --> 14:02.011
Ask for a dancer named Aom.

14:02.096 --> 14:05.890
You give her this.
Make sure the X is facing up like this.

14:05.975 --> 14:10.186
She's gonna give you a package.
Don't open it.

14:10.271 --> 14:13.189
- What's in it?
- It doesn't concern you.

14:13.274 --> 14:16.442
Then you go pick it up.

14:16.527 --> 14:21.322
- I'll find someone else.
- OK, OK, OK. I do it. I do it. I do it.

14:23.158 --> 14:26.995
Come straight back here.
You don't stop for anything.

14:27.079 --> 14:29.747
What if I have to piss? Huh?

14:30.791 --> 14:33.710
If you ask me one more question...

14:33.794 --> 14:37.547
Then I won't get paid. I know that.

14:40.509 --> 14:43.594
- OK, I go now.
- Hey.

14:44.179 --> 14:46.472
Take the cellphone.

17:25.633 --> 17:28.968
- You late, huh?
- Gimme the case.

17:31.764 --> 17:34.098
- You don't get paid for today.
- Why not?

17:34.183 --> 17:38.102
- You ran from the police.
- You said not to stop. I do what you said.

17:38.187 --> 17:40.813
Don't stop.
No stop for nothing, not even for piss.

17:40.898 --> 17:43.900
From now on,
I don't want any more police.

17:43.984 --> 17:47.028
You understand?

18:21.563 --> 18:26.901
The human face can mislead
in a thousand different ways.

18:26.986 --> 18:30.321
But the eyes never change.

18:30.406 --> 18:33.533
I was taught to start with the eyes.

19:46.357 --> 19:48.650
I'm Kong.

20:58.929 --> 21:01.389
Wait, wait, wait.

21:04.226 --> 21:06.728
The elephant.

21:08.522 --> 21:11.065
The nose, you see? Pointing down?

21:11.150 --> 21:13.818
Bad luck. No good.

21:13.903 --> 21:16.654
- Bad luck for you.
- Good night.

23:41.634 --> 23:44.761
Yeah, I'm checking on a wire transfer.

23:46.305 --> 23:50.767
Account code 6-5-1-4-3-4-6.

23:56.065 --> 23:58.399
Thank you.

24:35.562 --> 24:39.148
Hello. Um...
I have a... a cut,

24:39.233 --> 24:42.860
and I need some medicine,

24:42.945 --> 24:45.947
disinfectant.

24:46.031 --> 24:48.950
Do you speak English?

25:33.662 --> 25:35.913
How many?

25:38.792 --> 25:41.753
One?

25:46.717 --> 25:49.469
ln the morning? ln the morning.

25:50.512 --> 25:52.639
One...

25:52.723 --> 25:54.849
before bed.

26:07.613 --> 26:10.239
250 baht, sir.

26:17.998 --> 26:20.083
Thank you.

26:33.681 --> 26:35.974
I have it.

29:16.510 --> 29:19.262
- You're late.
- I'm sorry, boss.

29:19.346 --> 29:22.598
Don't be sorry. Be on time.

29:22.683 --> 29:26.144
What happened to your face?

29:27.271 --> 29:29.772
Some assholes tried to mug me.

29:29.857 --> 29:32.066
Like, 20 of them.

29:33.110 --> 29:35.695
But I kicked their asses.

29:39.116 --> 29:42.076
I'm so sorry, boss.

29:42.161 --> 29:45.371
So sorry. Th-they take...

29:48.751 --> 29:50.835
It's been opened.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.671
N-not me. It's them. They broke it.

29:53.756 --> 29:57.717
But I wouldn't let them have it.
I got it back for you.

29:59.720 --> 30:01.971
I don't let them have it.

30:04.016 --> 30:08.770
There's a beer in the refrigerator.
It'll take down the swelling.

30:09.396 --> 30:11.731
Yes, boss.

30:16.862 --> 30:20.323
- He's a bad man.
- Who?

30:20.407 --> 30:23.660
The man in the case.
You're going to kill him?

30:31.252 --> 30:33.920
- Can you teach me?
- Teach you what?

30:34.004 --> 30:36.089
Everything.

30:37.091 --> 30:39.175
I can help you.

30:52.564 --> 30:54.941
Please?

30:56.986 --> 30:59.279
Show me.

31:11.917 --> 31:13.042
Agh!

31:33.772 --> 31:58.004
Again.

32:02.968 --> 32:04.844
Good.

32:13.854 --> 32:14.896
Argh!

32:17.691 --> 32:20.276
That was your first lesson.

32:26.575 --> 32:29.577
Why didn't I kill him?

32:30.621 --> 32:33.164
Maybe it's because -

32:33.249 --> 32:36.042
and this is strange -

32:36.126 --> 32:39.879
somehow, when I looked into his eyes,

32:39.964 --> 32:42.465
I saw myself.

32:43.634 --> 32:46.135
So I became his teacher.

32:46.220 --> 32:51.015
The best way to defend yourself is to
know when something's about to happen.

32:51.100 --> 32:54.394
So you have to learn
to read your surroundings.

32:54.478 --> 32:56.980
See that man in the red jacket?

33:01.443 --> 33:02.485
What man?

33:09.493 --> 33:10.827
Agh!

33:10.911 --> 33:12.829
You're living in a city of mirrors.

33:12.913 --> 33:15.373
Store windows, glass office buildings,

33:15.457 --> 33:17.750
polished steel.

33:17.835 --> 33:20.962
Eyes in the back ofyour head.

33:22.965 --> 33:25.800
Ah!

33:27.219 --> 33:30.388
Eyes at the back of my head, boss, huh?
I got you now, boss.

33:30.472 --> 33:35.977
- I'm not your boss. I'm your teacher.
- So I call you...

33:50.534 --> 33:53.453
- How is he bad?
- This man?

33:54.955 --> 33:58.458
He hurts many country girls.
From the North.

33:58.542 --> 34:01.961
He buys them from their parents,
and sells them.

34:03.380 --> 34:06.215
Young girls, man.

34:06.300 --> 34:09.761
Same thing like devil, huh, this guy.

37:58.198 --> 38:01.117
How many people have you killed?

38:01.201 --> 38:03.745
I don't think about that.

38:04.204 --> 38:06.914
Do the police know who you are?

38:09.251 --> 38:13.046
No one knows who I am.
No one knows where I am.

38:15.716 --> 38:18.217
I know.

38:22.473 --> 38:24.974
- How many jobs in Bangkok?
- Four.

38:25.893 --> 38:27.935
Four.

38:28.020 --> 38:29.979
Two left, huh?

39:49.226 --> 39:51.144
Uh...

39:51.228 --> 39:53.521
Um... I...

39:57.318 --> 39:58.359
Um...

39:58.444 --> 40:04.407
C-can you help me? Could you tell her
that I wanna take her to dinner?

40:04.491 --> 40:06.784
Oh! Right.

40:52.164 --> 40:54.582
It's, uh, hot.

41:18.190 --> 41:20.733
That's just...

41:29.285 --> 41:31.911
Just eat it?

41:35.874 --> 41:38.876
It's cooling it down.

41:57.771 --> 42:01.816
It's hot again. It's really hot.

42:06.030 --> 42:08.990
The whole thing.

42:11.327 --> 42:13.828
Yeah, that's better.

42:32.431 --> 42:35.558
You don't pull the trigger.

42:35.643 --> 42:38.603
Squeeze it.

43:22.064 --> 43:24.816
- It's yours.
- Wh...?

43:24.900 --> 43:27.819
Congratulations.

45:27.189 --> 45:29.607
Where? Where?

45:32.736 --> 45:34.737
OK.

46:07.271 --> 46:09.147
- Boss?
- Yeah.

46:09.231 --> 46:13.151
I just left the club.
I think somebody's following me.

46:14.695 --> 46:17.864
Be at the Chao Phraya ferry station
in 20 minutes.

46:17.948 --> 46:20.074
- OK, boss.
- Wait for my call.

46:20.159 --> 46:22.577
Done, boss.

46:24.330 --> 46:29.626
OK, listen carefully.
Open the case. 65, 32, 15.

46:29.710 --> 46:32.295
Put the cellphone in the case,
and leave it.

46:32.379 --> 46:33.838
Got it.

47:21.762 --> 47:23.554
The case has returned.

47:44.368 --> 47:47.078
- Yes.
- Put your boss on.

47:58.382 --> 47:59.424
Yes.

47:59.508 --> 48:05.179
We had an arrangement. If I see
your people again, I'll kill your wife.

48:13.897 --> 48:15.982
We'll try again.

49:18.545 --> 49:22.131
Uh... wh-what is your work?

49:22.216 --> 49:24.175
Oh... uh...

49:25.844 --> 49:27.720
Banking.

49:27.805 --> 49:29.472
B... banker?

49:29.556 --> 49:32.558
- Banker, yes.
- Banker?

50:25.195 --> 50:33.870
Rain.

50:35.956 --> 50:39.000
ls you? Your name means rain?

50:41.086 --> 50:44.380
This... is your name.

52:20.686 --> 52:24.314
- Bad man?
- Bad for somebody.

52:25.232 --> 52:28.026
Floating market?
Where's Damnoen Saduak?

52:28.110 --> 52:31.195
Ratchaburi Province.
Hour and a half by car.

52:37.786 --> 52:40.872
Get some sleep.

52:40.956 --> 52:43.458
We leave early.

53:44.979 --> 53:47.271
Dock the boat up on the right.

54:11.297 --> 54:14.299
Hat. Hat.
Beautiful hat. Come. Come.

54:14.383 --> 54:17.302
You. You. You want hat? Want hat?

54:39.617 --> 54:42.118
Hey, mister, you buy something?

54:56.592 --> 54:58.968
Get us outta here. Get us out.

55:03.933 --> 55:07.310
Dock the boat on the left.

55:07.394 --> 55:10.355
Come on. Faster. Hurry up.

57:02.801 --> 57:04.761
- Boss...
- Get me over there!

57:48.013 --> 57:49.597
Fuck!

58:24.967 --> 58:26.718
Oh! No!

59:26.153 --> 59:29.155
Take it to the club.

59:29.240 --> 59:31.783
- He's same like you, you know?
- Who?

59:31.867 --> 59:34.786
This guy, in TV.

59:36.538 --> 59:39.290
He fight bad guys and helps the poor.

59:40.334 --> 59:42.377
Thai people love him.

59:44.421 --> 59:46.798
He's a very good man.

59:47.800 --> 59:50.385
Same like you.

01:05:20.674 --> 01:05:23.676
Four - know when it's time to get out.

01:05:33.145 --> 01:05:36.022
Three - erase every trace.

01:05:40.319 --> 01:05:42.111
Boss!

01:05:43.572 --> 01:05:47.575
Two - don't take an interest
in people outside of work.

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:03.800
One - don't ask questions.

01:06:08.097 --> 01:06:11.265
He's a very good man.

01:06:11.350 --> 01:06:13.184
Same like you.

01:07:05.863 --> 01:07:09.449
Political assassination
wasn't in the contract.

01:07:09.533 --> 01:07:12.076
So there are two ways to go.

01:07:12.161 --> 01:07:15.204
Refuse the job and walk away now,

01:07:15.289 --> 01:07:19.792
or do the job and walk away rich.

01:07:22.379 --> 01:07:26.466
The truth is almost anyone
can take out a politician.

01:07:26.550 --> 01:07:28.593
That's not the hard part.

01:07:28.677 --> 01:07:31.804
The hard part is getting away with it.

01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:56.305
Oh!

01:09:11.988 --> 01:09:14.073
Kong.

01:09:17.828 --> 01:09:20.537
Be here tomorrow at 6pm.

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:25.001
- Lastjob?
- Yeah.

01:09:25.085 --> 01:09:28.462
- Bad man?
- Bad for somebody.

01:09:29.423 --> 01:09:32.050
See you tomorrow, boss.

01:09:48.609 --> 01:09:50.193
Oh!

01:10:36.156 --> 01:10:38.241
Aom!

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:49.877
Kong!

01:11:15.696 --> 01:11:18.197
Aom!

01:14:12.414 --> 01:14:15.750
He fight bad guys
and helps the poor.

01:14:15.834 --> 01:14:18.544
Thai people love him.

01:17:26.901 --> 01:17:31.613
When the nightmare becomes real,
you don't hesitate. You don't think.

01:17:31.697 --> 01:17:35.491
You just run.
Anyone in the way goes down.

01:17:35.576 --> 01:17:38.328
It's pretty simple. You're the target now.

01:17:38.412 --> 01:17:41.539
Leave the country, or you're going to die.

01:19:24.518 --> 01:19:27.770
Why the fuck you care?

01:19:27.855 --> 01:19:30.356
He's my student.

01:19:43.913 --> 01:19:50.168
..which direction everybody's running, but
they seem to be running away from any...

01:23:23.257 --> 01:23:25.049
Argh!

01:26:58.389 --> 01:27:00.682
Kong...

01:28:41.283 --> 01:28:43.868
I had to tell them.

01:28:50.626 --> 01:28:52.961
Take her to the street.

01:28:53.045 --> 01:28:54.921
I cleared a way.

01:28:55.005 --> 01:28:56.881
I got one more job.

01:28:56.966 --> 01:28:58.633
Surat?

01:28:58.717 --> 01:29:01.552
He's very bad.
