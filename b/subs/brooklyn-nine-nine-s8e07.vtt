with me to the funeral.

Wait, why are you bringing the coffin?

01:30.173 --> 01:32.091
I brought a coffin
to my nana's funeral on a whim,

01:32.175 --> 01:33.343
and it was a big hit.

01:33.426 --> 01:36.095

normal human interaction.

Okay, fine. It doesn't have to be

Kevin countered with 50.

Which I countered with 30.

02:16.511 --> 02:17.720
Then Kevin says 40--

02:17.804 --> 02:19.389
Seems like a lot of math for therapy.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.182
That's what Dr. Cheryl said…

02:21.266 --> 02:23.143
which is why we fired her,

02:23.226 --> 02:24.936

that I might lose to him.

You mean lose him.

02:34.028 --> 02:35.280
No. Lose to him.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.611
He got a job in Wall Street.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.487
And one day his hand
got caught in a subway door.

Pappy Boyle was the best hugger.

Which is surprising because
he lost his hand in the subway.

Anyone can fake cry.

07:36.747 --> 07:38.291
You just have to think of something sad.

07:38.374 --> 07:40.001
Like that episode of
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"

07:40.084 --> 07:41.043
when Leonardo was in a coma.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.003
And that works?

07:42.086 --> 07:43.045
Yeah.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.464
Yeah, it does.

07:44.547 --> 07:45.798
Now, come on.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.508
Let's go poke some holes
in Lyndon's story.

07:47.592 --> 07:50.553
It was such a great party.
Everyone had the best time.

07:50.636 --> 07:51.596
I mean, except for Lyndon.

07:51.679 --> 07:52.597
Lyndon wasn't happy?

07:52.680 --> 07:53.973
Yeah, it was strange.

07:54.056 --> 07:55.475
<i>He was passing through the living room.</i>

07:55.558 --> 07:57.685
<i>I asked him if he wanted a little HJ.</i>

07:57.768 --> 07:59.145
<i>But he just ignored me.</i>

07:59.228 --> 08:01.189
<i>I mean, who doesn't want</i>
<i>an HJ from their cousin?</i>

08:01.272 --> 08:02.690
<i>Hold up. An HJ?</i>

08:02.773 --> 08:04.984
A head job. A massage.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.068
Isn't that what everyone calls it?

08:06.152 --> 08:07.278
-You bet.
-Absolutely not.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.113
Okay, so why was Lyndon angry?

08:09.197 --> 08:11.324
I bet it was whatever Pappy said to him.

08:11.407 --> 08:12.575
Wait. What Pappy said when?

08:12.658 --> 08:13.701
When they were in Pappy's study.

08:13.784 --> 08:15.161
<i>We heard raised voices.</i>

08:15.244 --> 08:16.621
<i>-And then Lyndon said…</i>
-Good night.

08:16.704 --> 08:17.872
<i>Walked out of the room,</i>

08:17.955 --> 08:19.207
<i>and closed the door behind him.</i>

08:19.290 --> 08:20.958
That's all he said? Good night?

08:21.042 --> 08:22.710
Gentlemen…

08:22.793 --> 08:25.087
I just solved this case.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.632
Sir, if you wanna get a date
off of these sites,

08:27.715 --> 08:28.883
you're gonna have to give me a little more

08:28.966 --> 08:30.092
from your profile photo.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.512
I just gave you a series of eight poses,

08:32.595 --> 08:35.014
each increasing in sexual provocativeness

08:35.097 --> 08:36.265
by one-eighth.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.975
If you wanted septiles or deciles

08:38.059 --> 08:39.560
of sexiness, you should've told me.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.229
-[groaning]
-What?

08:41.312 --> 08:42.522
Why do you care so much, Santiago?

08:42.605 --> 08:43.856
I thought you didn't like
the idea of me dating.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.233
Yes, initially.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.693
But then I thought about your metaphor

08:47.777 --> 08:49.403
about how relationships
are like a chess match.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.239
-Mm-hmm.
-And it really convinced me.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.573
That was a strong observation.

08:52.657 --> 08:55.326
So why don't you think
of this profile photo

08:55.409 --> 08:57.578
as an epic chess move?

08:57.662 --> 09:01.332
Like Vladimirov's Thunderbolt of 1987.

09:01.415 --> 09:02.833
Close the door, Diaz.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.795
I'm removing my collar stays.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.088
<i>Why am I back here?</i>

09:07.171 --> 09:09.340
Like I told you, it was a typical night.

09:09.423 --> 09:10.758
Right. Cousin kissing circle,

09:10.841 --> 09:12.051
everyone gets burped after dinner--

09:12.134 --> 09:13.261
normal stuff.

09:13.344 --> 09:14.220
But let's talk about what happened

09:14.303 --> 09:15.972
after the burping, shall we?

09:16.055 --> 09:17.306
What are you getting at?

09:17.390 --> 09:18.432
What exactly do you think
happened that night?

09:18.516 --> 09:20.226
I'm so glad you asked.

09:20.309 --> 09:22.687
<i>I think Pappy called you into his study</i>

09:22.770 --> 09:24.522
<i>and told you he was cutting</i>
<i>you out of his will.</i>

09:24.605 --> 09:26.691
<i>Tempers flared. Voices were raised.</i>

09:26.774 --> 09:27.942
-What?
<i>-You were furious</i>

09:28.025 --> 09:29.026
<i>you wouldn't be inheriting the farm.</i>

09:29.110 --> 09:30.236
I don't even want the farm.

09:30.319 --> 09:31.988
I've always been more of a city boy.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.364
I live in Poughkeepsie.

09:33.447 --> 09:34.490
Well, I guess that settles it.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.242
[chuckles]

09:36.325 --> 09:37.868
Except you didn't say I love you.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.120
Excuse me?

09:39.203 --> 09:40.204
When you left, you said "good night."

09:40.288 --> 09:41.747
You didn't say "I love you."

09:41.831 --> 09:43.374
Now, you may be a black sheep,
but you're still a Boyle.

09:43.457 --> 09:44.959
And a Boyle always says "I love you."

09:45.042 --> 09:46.294
-Not always.
-Look around you.

09:46.377 --> 09:47.712
It's written everywhere.

09:47.795 --> 09:50.673
[dramatic music]

09:50.756 --> 09:52.341
Okay, fine. We were fighting.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.051
But not over the will.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.137
Pappy was mad at me for missing
that Zoom call this summer.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.431
I mean honestly, Lyndon, what
did you expect would happen?

09:58.514 --> 10:00.433
He said I was a disgrace
to the Boyle name.

10:00.516 --> 10:01.892
So I didn't say "I love you."

10:01.976 --> 10:03.394
I just stormed out to the shed.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.354
I went to get the Grandmother Dough.

10:05.479 --> 10:06.939
The Grandmother Dough?

10:07.023 --> 10:08.274
[Boyle] <i>Here it is.</i>

10:08.357 --> 10:11.193
The original Boyle family
sourdough starter,

10:11.277 --> 10:13.154
the mother of the mother dough.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.655
It's still good, but the lid on the jar

10:14.739 --> 10:16.490
has been stuck for over a hundred years.

10:16.574 --> 10:19.827
There's an old family legend
that it can only be opened by

10:19.910 --> 10:21.871
The One True Boyle.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.080
I wanted to show my dad that I was

10:23.164 --> 10:24.332
not a disgrace to the family.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.416
But I couldn't budge it.

10:25.499 --> 10:26.459
Maybe he was right.

10:26.542 --> 10:28.336
Oh, Lyndon. What a tale.

10:28.419 --> 10:31.005
But I don't think that's why
you came in this barn at all.

10:31.088 --> 10:32.173
I think you came in here

10:32.256 --> 10:33.299
for this.

10:33.382 --> 10:34.550
Is that nutria poison?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.969
It's rat poison. Nutria are pets.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.262
You psychopath.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.222
Ah. Nitrobenzene.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.974
That causes the exact type of ulcers

10:42.058 --> 10:43.893
we found in Pappy Boyle's mouth.

10:43.976 --> 10:46.771
And look what we have here.

10:46.854 --> 10:49.732
A single brown hair,

10:49.815 --> 10:51.525
belonging to the murderer.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.653
Terry, please send this off
to the local police station

10:53.736 --> 10:55.154
for a DNA test.

10:55.237 --> 10:58.074
Now all we need is one
of your hairs, Lyndon.

10:58.157 --> 10:59.283
I didn't kill my father.

10:59.367 --> 11:00.576
Why am I being singled out?

11:00.660 --> 11:02.078
Why not take a hair from every Boyle

11:02.161 --> 11:03.788
so Cousin Lyndon doesn't feel that way?

11:03.871 --> 11:05.456
Sure, great idea. I'll go first.

11:05.539 --> 11:07.333
[Peralta] I mean it's more work for the
lab, but it's fine with me.

11:07.416 --> 11:09.877
Are you okay with that, Lyndon?

11:09.960 --> 11:11.170
Oh, wow. Went with a nose hair.

11:11.253 --> 11:12.296
Didn't see that coming.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.547
But it's definitely long enough.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.591
-[chuckles]
-No.

11:15.674 --> 11:17.134
Okay, sir. This app's pretty simple.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.011
If you don't like the guy's
profile, you click "dang,"

11:19.095 --> 11:20.638
and if you do, you click "daaang."

11:20.721 --> 11:21.764
That sounds needlessly confusing.

11:21.847 --> 11:22.723
Why? "dang" is bad

11:22.807 --> 11:23.766
and "daaang" is good.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.684
Okay, let's thin this herd.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.561
Untucked shirt, no thank you.

11:27.645 --> 11:30.022
Born in San Diego, yikes.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.649
An adult named Todd?

11:31.732 --> 11:34.026
So this is what online dating is like?

11:34.110 --> 11:35.403
I didn't realize.

11:35.486 --> 11:36.654
Realize how good you have it with Kevin?

11:36.737 --> 11:38.197
No, how it hasn't changed.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.324
You still have
to pick someone based on looks

11:40.408 --> 11:41.409
and hope for a connection later.

11:41.492 --> 11:42.785
Oh, Lord, help me.

11:42.868 --> 11:43.994
I'm going for it.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.121
-I'm clicking "dang."
-No.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.580
"Dang" is bad. Click "daaang."

11:46.664 --> 11:48.332
Why is this so confusing?

11:48.416 --> 11:50.334
How do I get Hot Todd back?

11:50.418 --> 11:52.420
DNA results are in.

11:52.503 --> 11:53.629
Ooh, and? Who did it?

11:53.712 --> 11:54.588
It was Lyndon, right?

11:54.672 --> 11:56.048
Hair is…

11:56.132 --> 11:57.425
"rodent in origin."

11:57.508 --> 11:58.342
What? Doesn't make any sense.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.385
Here, forward it to me.

11:59.468 --> 12:00.719
Must've been a nutria hair.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.513
Those things are everywhere. Ugh.

12:02.596 --> 12:03.639
Wait a minute. This is weird.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.307
According to the DNA results,

12:05.391 --> 12:07.560
everyone in the Boyle family
is related except one.

12:07.643 --> 12:08.519
-Lyndon?
-No.

12:08.602 --> 12:09.687
Charles.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.106
Charles Boyle

12:12.189 --> 12:13.441
isn't a Boyle.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.946
That DNA test has to be wrong.

12:19.029 --> 12:21.407
I mean, Charles is the most
Boyle-y of all the Boyles.

12:21.490 --> 12:22.825
You know what?
I'm gonna call Charles' dad,

12:22.908 --> 12:24.076
get to the bottom of this.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.164
Hey, Lynn? It's Jake.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.082
Hi. Hey, can I ask you

12:30.166 --> 12:31.709
about Charles' paternity real quick?

12:33.294 --> 12:34.545
All right. Thanks, Lynn. Bye.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.005
What on Earth took so long?

12:36.088 --> 12:37.465
Well, the first five hours

12:37.548 --> 12:39.633
was mostly just sobbing
and gasping for air.

12:39.717 --> 12:42.136
Then he told me
that Charles' mom had an affair

12:42.219 --> 12:43.721
with a rival florist.

12:43.804 --> 12:45.473
Lynn always suspected
he might've been Charles' dad,

12:45.556 --> 12:47.224
but he decided he loved him
so much, it didn't matter.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.601
I don't understand.

12:48.684 --> 12:50.478
Charles looks just like all
the other Boyles.

12:50.561 --> 12:51.770
Apparently that's not genetic.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.439
The Boyles cuddle their children so much,

12:53.522 --> 12:54.773
it shapes their bones that way.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.859
He likened it to how they
grow square watermelons.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.110
Oh, my God.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.403
We can't tell Charles.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.863
You wanna lie to our dear friend

13:00.946 --> 13:02.531
about the one thing
that's most important to him

13:02.615 --> 13:04.408
in the whole world?

13:04.492 --> 13:06.118
-Yes.
-Okay, good, me too.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.661
Now all we have to do is prove
that Cousin Lyndon is

13:07.745 --> 13:10.080
the murderer before Charles
asks about the DNA results.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.123
Hi, guys.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.541
Ah. Hey, man.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.501
Where'd you come from?

13:13.584 --> 13:14.960
I slinked up.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.170
You know how good Boyles are at slinking.

13:16.253 --> 13:17.755
It's because of our fleshy toe pads.

13:17.838 --> 13:19.507
Right. And you, Charles,

13:19.590 --> 13:21.550
have said fleshy toe pads

13:21.634 --> 13:22.927
because you are a Boyle,

13:23.010 --> 13:27.056
from snout to anus.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.058
"A Boyle from snout to anus."

13:29.141 --> 13:30.226
That is so sweet.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.560
I'm stealing that for the eulogy.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.479
Ah, you don't have to.

13:33.562 --> 13:34.480
<i>Huh.</i>

13:34.563 --> 13:35.731
It's the exact time we agreed
to meet for our date,

13:35.814 --> 13:36.690
and he's not here.

13:36.774 --> 13:37.900
I'm sorry.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.235
I know how you value punctuality.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.444
In my employees.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.446
But in potential suitors, I don't mind

13:42.530 --> 13:43.822
one or two minutes of tardiness.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.741
I like a bad boy.

13:45.824 --> 13:47.159
Now, if you'll excuse me,

13:47.243 --> 13:49.328
I'm going to go to the bathroom
to wash my hands,

13:49.411 --> 13:51.413
in case we shake.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.624
Ooh. [laughs]

13:53.707 --> 13:55.584
I thought the point was for Holt to bail

13:55.668 --> 13:56.794
before he got to an actual date.

13:56.877 --> 13:58.504
It is. But this works too.

13:58.587 --> 13:59.964
I mean, did you see
the dude he matched with?

14:00.047 --> 14:01.257
He calls himself a doctor,

14:01.340 --> 14:02.925
but he's actually a chiropractor.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.302
Are we sure Holt doesn't
respect chiropractors?

14:05.386 --> 14:07.972
[laughter]

14:08.055 --> 14:09.223
I'm kidding.

14:09.306 --> 14:11.058
Ooh. There's Todd.

14:12.351 --> 14:13.519
And here's Holt.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.104
Started off strong, nice big smile.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.147
Oh, not anymore.
He just noticed Todd's loafers.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.732
Oh, Todd, you fool.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.235
Holt thinks any shoes
without laces are flip-flops.

14:21.318 --> 14:23.779
Now the moment that will send
Holt running toward the exit.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.739
When he asks Todd
what he would like to drink,

14:25.823 --> 14:27.658
Todd orders, "Whatever you're having."

14:27.741 --> 14:30.661
Oh Todd, you fool. Have your own opinion.

14:30.744 --> 14:32.955
Wait a second. Are they gonna sit down?

14:33.038 --> 14:34.081
In a booth?

14:34.164 --> 14:35.124
Oh, no, Rosa.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.250
Todd's not the fool.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.626
We're the fools.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.087
I have eyes on the package.

14:41.505 --> 14:42.506

<i>-Seriously, guys,</i>

14:42.590 --> 14:43.674
<i>why are we doing this?</i>

14:43.757 --> 14:45.259
We should just wait for the DNA test.

14:45.342 --> 14:46.552
We will.

14:46.635 --> 14:47.720
But the lab said it would take a week.

14:47.803 --> 14:49.555
They had to get a new tech.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.056
Oh, no. Why?

14:51.140 --> 14:54.226
The old one had
a bad allergic reaction to…

14:54.310 --> 14:55.728
-beakers.
<i>-Ugh.</i>

14:55.811 --> 14:57.229

14:57.354 --> 14:58.814
Yeah, and real.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.691
Anyways, since Lyndon
is our only actual suspect,

15:00.774 --> 15:02.359
we might as well investigate.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.527
Let me ask you this. Is he gushing?

15:03.611 --> 15:04.778
Don't say those words.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.155
The pressure of keeping secrets

15:06.238 --> 15:07.865

15:07.948 --> 15:09.325

15:12.995 --> 15:14.538
Wait. He's leaving the property.

15:14.622 --> 15:15.873
Can you stay with him?

15:15.956 --> 15:17.124
Yeah. I think so.

15:17.207 --> 15:18.292
I just have to get around the barn and--

15:19.418 --> 15:21.503

15:21.587 --> 15:23.088
I'm sorry. I was following Lyndon

15:23.172 --> 15:25.132
and I crawled into that thing.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.508
That thing has a name.

15:26.592 --> 15:27.801
It's Muffin.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.345
Well, thanks to Muffin, we lost Lyndon.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.139
Yes. But also thanks to Muffin,

15:32.222 --> 15:35.017
I just solved the case
of who killed Pappy Boyle.

15:37.144 --> 15:39.271
Yeah. I didn't think it would feed back.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.565
Oh, no, Rosa. They're leaving together.

15:41.649 --> 15:42.524
What are we gonna do?

15:42.608 --> 15:43.776
We stop them.

15:43.859 --> 15:44.818
Even if it means we have to kill Todd.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.196
Smart. Let's go.

15:47.279 --> 15:48.238
Looking for someone?

15:48.322 --> 15:50.824
Sir. Uh, what's going on?

15:50.908 --> 15:53.285
What's going on is that you
were trying to manipulate me,

15:53.369 --> 15:55.162
but it is I who manipulated you.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.413
How does it feel

15:56.497 --> 15:59.458
to suckle from your own tainted teat?

15:59.541 --> 16:01.043
Not as bad as it feels
to hear you say "suckle."

16:01.126 --> 16:03.671
So you were never really
going home with Todd?

16:03.754 --> 16:06.382
You actually think I would
have relations with him?

16:06.465 --> 16:08.467
His watch has a cloth strap.

16:08.550 --> 16:09.635
I really thought we had something.

16:09.718 --> 16:11.470
Wake up, Todd. I'm out of your league.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.806
You thought you could meddle
in my personal life,

16:13.889 --> 16:16.642
but I was ten moves ahead the whole time.

16:16.725 --> 16:17.851
And now, checkmate.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.144
Ooh. I love chess.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.479
Have you seen <i>The Queen's Gambit?</i>

16:20.562 --> 16:22.940
-It's a TV show.
-Todd, I swear to God.

16:23.023 --> 16:25.359
The person who killed Pappy
wasn't a person at all.

16:25.442 --> 16:26.652
It was Muffin.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.153
-[all gasp]
-I checked her mouth,

16:28.237 --> 16:30.239
and Muffin had the same ulcers
that Pappy had.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.700
Muffin ate the poison,
and then Pappy drank her milk.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.618
Charles, you said nutria could open doors.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.662
Muffin must've let herself into the barn.

16:36.745 --> 16:38.122
Which explains why we found
her hair on the box.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.873
So Lyndon was innocent.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.667
Wait, how did you know
it was Muffin's hair?

16:41.750 --> 16:43.252
Did you get the DNA report back?

16:43.335 --> 16:44.586
-Exactly.
-Wait, but I thought

16:44.670 --> 16:45.754
the report was gonna take a week

16:45.838 --> 16:46.964
because of the lab tech's allergies.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.340
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.050
But then they decided
to use a subcontractor

16:50.134 --> 16:51.677
who was allergy-free,
so let's just move on

16:51.760 --> 16:52.720
and talk about something else immediately.

16:52.803 --> 16:53.929
Three "uh-huh's"?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.806
Clearly you're lying about something.

16:55.889 --> 16:56.974
Why you being a jerk to me?

16:57.057 --> 16:58.392
Show me the report, Jake.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.019
Okay, fine.
But just look at the top result

17:00.102 --> 17:02.229
'cause that's all that matters.

17:02.312 --> 17:03.981
"Specimen hair was rodent in nature."

17:04.064 --> 17:05.566
And that's that.

17:05.649 --> 17:08.777
Oh, my God.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.237
-I'm not a Boyle.
-[all gasp]

17:13.323 --> 17:15.492
Okay. I love you too, Dad.

17:15.576 --> 17:16.702

17:16.785 --> 17:18.579
Yeah, Charles. It's tomorrow now.

17:18.662 --> 17:20.289
You been on the phone for 14 hours.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.915
Well, you know what they say,

17:21.999 --> 17:24.168
"Time flies when God pulls down his pants

17:24.251 --> 17:25.961
and takes a dump on your life."

17:26.045 --> 17:27.755
Oh, buddy. I'm so sorry.

17:27.838 --> 17:30.215
Being a Boyle was
the backbone of my identity.

17:30.299 --> 17:33.010
Without the Boyle backbone,
I'm just a bag of flesh.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.928
-I'm goo.
-Come on, you're not goo.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.472
Being a Boyle is about more than blood.

17:36.555 --> 17:37.681
It's what's in your heart.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.266
Blood is what's in your heart.

17:39.349 --> 17:40.642
You're making it worse, Jake.

17:40.726 --> 17:41.977
Okay, fine. Then what about Nikolaj?

17:42.061 --> 17:43.437
He was adopted, so technically,

17:43.520 --> 17:44.938
he's not a Boyle,
but that never bothered you.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.440
I didn't even think about Niko.

17:46.523 --> 17:48.734
He was already a Boyle once removed

17:48.817 --> 17:50.986
which is tough enough.
Now he's twice removed?

17:51.070 --> 17:53.572
Twice-removed Boyles
are a total [bleep] clown show,

17:53.655 --> 17:56.950

17:57.034 --> 17:58.869

-Look, let's go home.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.792
We're leaving? What about the funeral?

18:04.875 --> 18:06.001
What about the eulogy?

18:06.085 --> 18:07.336
I don't feel right giving it now.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.671
Sam offered to step in.
I'll have him do it.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.298
No, no, no. Wait.

18:11.381 --> 18:12.633

18:12.716 --> 18:14.343
Last night, we learned
that Pappy Boyle's death

18:14.426 --> 18:15.552
was not foul play.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.513
But even though there was no murder,

18:17.596 --> 18:18.931
there was a robbery.

18:19.014 --> 18:21.517
Charles had his sense
of self stolen from him

18:21.600 --> 18:22.935
by Sam Boyle.

18:23.018 --> 18:24.561
-[all gasp]
-You said it yourself, Charles,

18:24.645 --> 18:27.147

of cousin-on-cousin jealousy.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.483
Sam couldn't stand that you
were chosen to give the eulogy.

18:29.566 --> 18:31.276

<i>And finally, Sam who made</i>
<i>sure we all knew the results.</i>

18:43.497 --> 18:45.415
Did you get the DNA report back?

18:45.499 --> 18:47.543
This is ridiculous. I love Charles.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.002
Okay, well then.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.379
I'm sure you wouldn't mind
giving him a hug then.

18:50.462 --> 18:51.672
Since you love him so much.

18:51.755 --> 18:54.758
Sure. I always like to hug my cousin.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.260

18:56.343 --> 18:57.344
Darn it.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.012
I thought these would hide it,

18:59.096 --> 19:01.265
but I gushed through my pit diapers.

19:01.348 --> 19:02.808
All right, fine.

19:02.891 --> 19:05.144
I always suspected
that Charles wasn't one of us.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.229
I mean, he went through puberty at 13,

19:07.312 --> 19:08.647
instead of 25,

19:08.730 --> 19:10.732
like a normal Boyle.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.652
And when he got chosen to give the eulogy,

19:13.735 --> 19:15.487
something inside of me snapped.

19:15.571 --> 19:16.947
So I hid the will.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.240
I admit it.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.283
Are you happy now?

19:19.366 --> 19:20.617
-Very.
-Not at all.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.452
Wait, what? Charles, we solved the case.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.413
-He confessed.
-Doesn't matter.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.290
I'm still not a Boyle.

19:26.373 --> 19:29.960
I'm just a normal person.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.390
I won't be doing any gloating.

19:43.473 --> 19:45.392
I mean, I did last night.
I went home and had a drink

19:45.475 --> 19:47.477
to toast to your humiliation.

19:47.561 --> 19:48.645
But it didn't feel right,

19:48.729 --> 19:49.813
because I had no one to toast with,

19:49.897 --> 19:51.356
no one to share my glee.

19:51.440 --> 19:55.569
I had won, but I was alone.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.794
[grunting]

22:19.796 --> 22:22.674
[dramatic music]

22:30.432 --> 22:31.558
Ah!

22:31.641 --> 22:32.642
I did it!

22:32.726 --> 22:34.102
He's The One True Boyle.

22:34.186 --> 22:37.022
[cheers and laughter]

22:37.105 --> 22:38.940
Oh, my God. What is that stench?

22:39.024 --> 22:40.358
It's the Grandmother Dough.

22:40.442 --> 22:41.526
It smells horrible.

22:41.610 --> 22:44.112
Not to a Boyle. [sniffs deeply]

22:44.196 --> 22:47.532
Pappy's hugs were long and firm.

22:47.616 --> 22:48.867
Okay, here's what I think
might've happened.

22:48.950 --> 22:50.827
You loosened the jar,
but you didn't realize it

22:50.911 --> 22:51.995
because you're a Godzilla man,

22:52.079 --> 22:53.497
and you don't know your own strength.

22:53.580 --> 22:55.290
First of all, thank you
for calling me a Godzilla man.

22:55.373 --> 22:56.792
-Yeah.
-Secondly, that's not it.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.460
-The jar was too slippery.
-All right, how about this?

22:58.543 --> 23:00.462
Charles was so freaked out
about not being a Boyle

23:00.545 --> 23:02.756
that he got an adrenaline rush,
and that made him stronger.

23:02.839 --> 23:04.800
Or maybe Charles is the One True Boyle.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.843
And I know that Pappy's up there

23:06.927 --> 23:09.137
shopping for beige slacks

23:09.221 --> 23:12.474
at that Mervyn's in the sky.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.060
[all] Ah, Mervyn's!

23:15.143 --> 23:17.104
Yeah, he's the One True Boyle.
