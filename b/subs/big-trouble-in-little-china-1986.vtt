WEBVTT

00:09.635 --> 00:14.055
What l'd like to do today is
get your version of what happened.

00:14.723 --> 00:17.642
- You mean the truth?
- Of course.

00:18.185 --> 00:21.854
First, just state your name and
your occupation for the record.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.941
Egg Shen, bus driver.

00:25.651 --> 00:29.696
Bus driver.
What kind of bus and where, please?

00:30.906 --> 00:36.577
Tour bus. Bus for tourists.
San Francisco Chinatown.

00:36.745 --> 00:42.709
Thank you. Now, before we get
to the meat of this thing,

00:42.876 --> 00:46.129
do you at the present time
have any knowledge

00:46.296 --> 00:48.965
of the whereabouts of
a Mr Jack Burton or his truck?

00:49.133 --> 00:52.760
- Oh, God. WiIl you Ieave him alone?
- Mr Shen, pIease.

00:52.928 --> 00:55.555
You couId be in a great deal of troubIe.

00:55.723 --> 00:59.142
Half a city block
expIodes in a baIl of green flame.

00:59.309 --> 01:02.270
Green fIame! AIl heIl is breaking loose here.

01:02.438 --> 01:04.938
And there are peopIe
who say you're involved,

01:05.107 --> 01:10.069
that you might be responsible,
that you're a very dangerous man.

01:10.237 --> 01:14.991
- Now, if you're protecting Jack Burton...
- You Ieave Jack Burton aIone!

01:16.118 --> 01:20.163
We are in his debt.
He showed great courage.

01:25.502 --> 01:28.254
OK.

01:28.422 --> 01:32.091
But if l'm gonna be your attorney,
there are a few things I have to know

01:32.259 --> 01:34.635
that stiIl don't make any sense to me.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.846
Like...

01:37.598 --> 01:39.891
do you reaIly believe in magic?

01:41.101 --> 01:43.603
You mean Chinese black magic?

01:43.771 --> 01:46.689
- Yes.
- AbsoIutely.

01:46.857 --> 01:52.320
Are you stiIl serious about this? And
monsters and ghosts as welI, I suppose?

01:52.488 --> 01:55.531
Sure. And sorcery.

01:56.784 --> 02:02.205
And I suppose that you expect me
to beIieve in sorcery as weIl?

02:02.372 --> 02:04.707
- Of course.
- Why?

02:04.875 --> 02:07.126
Because it's reaI.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.294
How can I know that, Mr Shen?

02:09.463 --> 02:13.508
- How?
- Yes, how? Help me out here.

02:14.218 --> 02:15.510
Please.

02:22.392 --> 02:25.102
See? That was nothing.

02:26.355 --> 02:29.357
But that's how it always begins.

02:29.525 --> 02:31.859
Very smalI.

02:55.425 --> 03:00.513
This is Jack Burton at the Pork-Chop Express
and l'm talkin' to whoever's listenin'.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.765
lt's Iike I toId my last wife.

03:02.933 --> 03:05.893
l says "Honey,
l never drive faster than I can see."

03:06.061 --> 03:09.981
"Besides that, it's alI in the refIexes."

03:15.654 --> 03:21.075
You just Iisten to the Pork-Chop Express and
take his advice on a dark and stormy night.

03:21.243 --> 03:24.078
When some wild-eyed maniac
grabs your neck,

03:24.246 --> 03:27.081
taps the back of your head
up against a barroom waIl,

03:27.249 --> 03:31.127
he looks you crooked in the eye
and asks you if you've paid your dues,

03:31.295 --> 03:33.588
you just stare that big sucker
back in the eye,

03:33.755 --> 03:37.216
and remember what Jack Burton
aIways says.

03:37.384 --> 03:42.346
"Have you paid your dues, Jack?"
"Υes, sir, the check is in the maiI."

03:58.864 --> 04:04.785
WeIl, you see, I'm not sayin' that l've been
everywhere and l've done everything.

04:04.953 --> 04:08.873
But I do know it's a pretty
amazing pIanet we live on here,

04:09.041 --> 04:14.378
and a man would have to be some kinda
fool to think we're aIl alone in this universe.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.503
l can't believe you're stuck on even.
This is odd!

05:37.671 --> 05:40.381
AlI right, even! Another even! Come on!

05:40.549 --> 05:43.467
You want one more? AIl right!

05:48.306 --> 05:51.100
- What do we got? He can't count.
- Even!

05:51.268 --> 05:55.104
Learn how to play some fan-tan here,
buddy-boy!

05:55.272 --> 05:57.523
Three!

06:17.461 --> 06:20.504
Heaven and earth, boys. What can I telI ya?

06:23.258 --> 06:27.511
You like that one?
What did he say, Wang? ln English?

06:27.679 --> 06:31.307
Something about beginner's luck.
lt doesn't translate. But he quits.

06:31.475 --> 06:37.480
He quits? What is this? lt's a brand-new day
and he's stilI got 100 bucks in his pocket.

06:37.647 --> 06:42.443
l'm not gonna complain, because l'lI bet l'd
have lost my shirt in the next 20 minutes.

06:42.611 --> 06:45.613
Breaks my heart to do this,
but the next time l'm down here,

06:45.781 --> 06:49.742
you'lI gang up on Jack so fast
he won't know what the heIl happened.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.286
- No.
- Ah, sure. Easy come, easy go, Wang.

06:52.454 --> 06:53.579
No!

06:55.457 --> 06:58.375
Not next time. Now.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.672
ls this gonna get ugly now? I hope not.

07:03.840 --> 07:07.009
l thought what we were here,
racial differences aside,

07:07.177 --> 07:10.679
was a coupIa old friends,
both of us CaIifornians.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.432
Shit, Wang. lt's only a game.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.854
Nothin' or doubIe.

07:19.022 --> 07:22.108
This knife cuts this bottIe in half.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.361
- Nothin' or doubIe.
- BulIshit.

07:25.529 --> 07:28.030
- Nothin' or doubIe.
- Why, man? Don't be stupid.

07:28.198 --> 07:31.200
- I need the money.
- I got near a thousand bucks here, Wang.

07:31.368 --> 07:33.536
1,148, Jack.

07:39.626 --> 07:42.461
OK. But not that bottIe.

07:45.257 --> 07:46.715
This bottle.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.222
OK.

07:53.390 --> 07:56.267
You're outta your mind, Wang.
God bIess ya!

08:08.071 --> 08:11.323
- lt's alI in the reflexes.
- lt aIways works at home.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.368
Have me over for dinner some year
and prove it.

08:14.536 --> 08:17.163
ln the meantime, pay up: $1,148 times two.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.124
- I don't have that kind of money.
- I didn't hear that.

08:20.292 --> 08:22.668
l'm just a poor Chinese boy, you know?

08:22.836 --> 08:25.504
You own a restaurant. That's more than me.

08:25.672 --> 08:30.426
Yeah, right. What I meant was,
l don't got that kind of money on me.

08:30.594 --> 08:33.554
That's what I thought you meant.
Where's your truck?

08:33.763 --> 08:35.931
- I gotta go somewhere.
- No, you don't.

08:36.099 --> 08:39.434
l do. How about we meet in my restaurant
in a few hours? I pay then.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.104
- You pay now. Where you gotta go?
- The airport.

08:42.272 --> 08:45.566
- Yeah, right. Over my dead body.
- lf need be.

08:47.068 --> 08:50.738
- l'Il folIow you.
- You don't trust me? That makes me sad.

08:50.906 --> 08:54.783
- lt reminds me of an oId Chinese joke.
- Save it. I'Il give you a lift. Get in.

08:54.951 --> 08:59.371
- You were gonna foIlow me, Jack.
- I know, then I came to my senses.

08:59.998 --> 09:03.083
- So who are we pickin' up?
- A girI. I don't wanna talk about it.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.502
- A girI? Where from?
- Peking.

09:06.338 --> 09:10.257
This is a big day in my Iife. I shouId
have gone home and gotten 40 winks.

09:10.425 --> 09:13.135
A girI from China?
AlI right, I never done that.

09:13.303 --> 09:18.057
l picked up girIs from everywhere else,
but never from China. ls she pretty?

09:19.476 --> 09:22.770
- l'm gonna marry her, Jack.
- Oh, God!

09:22.938 --> 09:27.107
l've known her since we were kids.
l haven't seen her in five years.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.944
l came here aIone.
l worked my fingers tiIl they bled.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.112
Before you knew me, I sIept on the floor.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.491
l saved every nickeI to bring her here
because I love her so much.

09:35.659 --> 09:38.786
l can't eat, sIeep or think properly
without her any more.

09:38.954 --> 09:41.747
She'lI put my whole life in order.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.500
Boy, Iisten to me. ReaI tough guy.

09:44.668 --> 09:47.670
You sound a little nervous, pal.

09:48.171 --> 09:53.801
That's why the bottle didn't slice. My mind
and my spirit are goin' north and south.

10:01.935 --> 10:06.605
Flight number 26 has just arrived
at gate number seven.

10:11.486 --> 10:14.196
Whoa. Who is that?

10:15.490 --> 10:18.284
She has green eyes.
You know how rare that is, Jack?

10:18.451 --> 10:23.205
- How can you teIl from here?
- Not her. She's trouble. Miao Yin.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.875
Beautiful green eyes, like creamy jade.

10:27.502 --> 10:28.794
Trouble, huh?

10:41.808 --> 10:44.893
- Can I ask you a serious question?
- AbsoIutely not.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.937
Would you consider jumping right into...

10:47.105 --> 10:49.398
Sure, but not with a man in your condition.

10:49.566 --> 10:54.069
- What's wrong with my condition?
- Try standing downwind where I am.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.237
lt's MilIer time.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.614
You know what I say when it's MiIler time?

10:59.659 --> 11:02.119
Wait a minute!

11:02.620 --> 11:04.538
- Don't!
- Don't what?

11:04.706 --> 11:10.294
The Lords of Death. Street gang. Punks
from Chinatown. What are they doing here?

11:44.371 --> 11:45.954
Tara!

11:49.626 --> 11:51.877
Miao Yin!

12:02.305 --> 12:03.305
Excuse me.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.273
Let's you and me have a littIe talk, friend.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.067
What?

12:15.235 --> 12:17.236
Where'd you get that?

12:25.203 --> 12:26.954
Wait a minute, paI.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.124
Get that one!

12:38.091 --> 12:40.426
Come on, Jack!

12:57.068 --> 12:58.777
Where?

13:00.029 --> 13:02.197
CalI the cops!

13:24.220 --> 13:26.472
Son of a bitch must pay!

13:30.602 --> 13:33.395
What's goin' on, Wang?
Why'd they steal your girI?

13:33.563 --> 13:37.941
You teIl me! How come it's not safe to walk
in CentraI Park or to give a stranger a Iift?

13:38.109 --> 13:40.235
Because the world's fuIl of crazy peopIe.

13:40.403 --> 13:43.572
The American girl knew something was up.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.908
Stay away from her. She's a lawyer.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.994
She's a what? Oh, come on!

13:49.746 --> 13:53.248
- What the helI...?
- They got a clubhouse where they hang out.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.542
- To sharpen their knives?
- I can't ask you to...

13:55.710 --> 13:57.586
- Where is it?
- Thank you, Jack.

14:03.343 --> 14:08.597
Good morning, Iadies and gentlemen.
l am Mr Egg Shen, with this wonderful tour.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.391
Sit back and enjoy yourseIves, see?

14:11.559 --> 14:17.189
Long time ago, Chinese men with
gold-rush fever flooded into California.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.776
We calI Gum Shan - Mountain of GoId, see?

14:20.944 --> 14:24.112
Leaving behind their wives and chiIdren.

14:24.614 --> 14:28.742
Working for years to compIete
the transcontinentaI railroad,

14:28.910 --> 14:33.121
saving alI their pennies.
And then they sent for their famiIies

14:33.289 --> 14:37.292
to heIp build this beautifuI Chinatown
you see outside your window

14:37.460 --> 14:40.462
this fine warm day.

15:10.618 --> 15:13.579
- Go right, down that aIley. Lords of Death!
- What aIley?

15:13.746 --> 15:15.581
Go right! Now!

15:36.811 --> 15:39.730
- Where the helI are we?
- Come on, Jack.

15:42.358 --> 15:45.986
Excuse me, ma'am.
l don't suppose you saw a...

15:50.241 --> 15:51.992
No.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.202
Keep moving.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.815
- What is it? A parade?
- A funeraI.

16:23.983 --> 16:27.569
- A fighting tong. They're Chang Sings.
- A fighting tong?

16:27.737 --> 16:31.573
Don't panic, Jack.
They're OK. They're good guys.

16:32.492 --> 16:36.453
Maybe we should try a different alIey.
What do you say?

16:42.335 --> 16:46.129
Wang, these guys, these Sing Dings.
They got enemies?

16:46.297 --> 16:48.757
- Wing Kong.
- Who wear red turbans?

16:48.925 --> 16:50.759
Holy shit!

16:50.927 --> 16:53.220
These guys are animals, Jack.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.856
- What's happening, Wang?
- Chinese standoff.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.858
A what?

18:30.026 --> 18:32.152
Don't make a sound.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.490
Who's that?

21:52.353 --> 21:55.271
No questions! Just get outta here, Jack!

22:12.790 --> 22:14.791
Jack!

22:19.630 --> 22:22.132
- I think it was Lo Pan.
- Who?

22:39.567 --> 22:41.776
- Don't look, Jack!
- I aIready did.

22:41.944 --> 22:43.945
- Who? I mean, what?
- Lo Pan. Come on!

22:44.113 --> 22:48.033
- I can't see!
- lt's OK. It's onIy temporary. Over here.

22:49.452 --> 22:51.536
Bend over.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.998
Yeah, yeah.

22:55.166 --> 22:58.626
l ran straight through him, Wang.
How the heIl did I do that?

22:58.794 --> 23:01.296
- You didn't. lt only appeared that way.
- Right!

23:01.464 --> 23:06.426
- Lords of Death, Jack.
- OK, l'm goin' home. Keep your money.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.636
- Hey, Wang Chi!
- Lookin' for us?

23:08.804 --> 23:12.140
- They know your name.
- That's not good. Let's go!

23:15.144 --> 23:17.228
- My truck!
- Forget it!

23:38.125 --> 23:42.670
Lords of Death controIled by the Wing Kong,
Jack. Just errand boys for the Wing Kong.

23:42.838 --> 23:47.175
Great! Who wiped out alI those
yeIlow turbans? Those guys were winning.

23:53.057 --> 23:55.433
He says it was the Storms.
The Three Storms.

23:55.601 --> 23:57.852
Three guys did aIl that? Listen.

23:58.020 --> 24:01.856
What about that...
whatever it was I ran straight through?

24:02.024 --> 24:03.274
Fast!

24:14.995 --> 24:17.372
Lucky us. We made it.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.833
AlI right, where's my truck? l'm outta here.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.376
lsn't your truck insured?

24:21.544 --> 24:24.003
- Of course it is.
- Then smart man gets it Iater.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.338
Smart man calIs the cops.

24:25.506 --> 24:28.675
- Cops got better things to do than get kiIled.
- So do l!

24:32.346 --> 24:35.974
Mutual Fidelity lnsurers of Sacramento.

24:36.142 --> 24:40.311
WeIl, there's gotta be a listing, honey.
l pay 'em six G's a year in premiums.

24:40.479 --> 24:46.484
China is here, Mr Burton.
The Chang Sing, the Wing Kong.

24:47.153 --> 24:51.156
- They've been fighting for centuries.
- What does that mean? "China is here"?

24:51.323 --> 24:53.783
l don't know what that means.
AlI I know is,

24:53.951 --> 24:56.202
this Lo Pan character comes out of thin air

24:56.370 --> 25:01.749
in the middle of an alIey, while his buddies
fly around, cuttin' everybody to shreds,

25:01.917 --> 25:05.920
and he stands there, waiting for me
to drive my truck straight through him,

25:06.088 --> 25:09.549
- with Iight comin' out of his mouth!
- Jack, pIease.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.554
- When did this happen?
- lt didn't, not Iike he says.

25:14.722 --> 25:20.518
Yeah, it did. Two hours ago. TaIl guy, weird
clothes. First you see him, then you don't.

25:20.686 --> 25:23.229
Lo Pan appeared on the street?

25:24.190 --> 25:27.400
- Why didn't you telI me?
- I didn't want to alarm you, Uncle.

25:27.568 --> 25:31.905
l'm gonna telI you about an accident
and I don't wanna hear "act of God", OK?

25:32.072 --> 25:35.533
AlI right, Iook. What's your name?
Mine's Jack Burton.

25:35.701 --> 25:39.120
- Good afternoon, Mr Wong.
- Eddie Lee, meet my friend, Jack Burton.

25:39.288 --> 25:42.624
- Eddie's the new maître d' here.
- And a whoIe Iot more.

25:42.791 --> 25:46.294
WeIl, I don't know my poIicy number.
lt's in the glove compartment.

25:46.462 --> 25:49.214
Just Iook under B-U-R-T-O-N, wiIl ya?

25:49.381 --> 25:51.966
- Jack Burton?
- Yeah.

25:52.343 --> 25:55.637
Boy. The guy you always toId me about.

25:56.680 --> 26:00.391
- Then that was your abandoned truck.
- Abandoned, like heIl!

26:00.559 --> 26:02.685
HelIo. HeIlo?

26:02.853 --> 26:04.312
Oh, Christ!

26:04.480 --> 26:07.482
Bad news. The Lords of Death
stoIe it after you ran away.

26:07.650 --> 26:11.319
- They stole my truck?
- Take it easy, Jack. You're with friends.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.780
- We'lI find it for you.
- Damn right you wilI.

26:13.948 --> 26:16.616
And my money. And time is money
to a guy like me.

26:16.784 --> 26:18.743
And your phone is dead, by the way.

26:18.911 --> 26:24.290
-How do you think I feeI? I Iost a whoIe girl!
-The Lords of Death were onIy on a joyride.

26:24.458 --> 26:26.501
Not acting on orders from the Wing Kong.

26:26.669 --> 26:30.255
They just wanted a girI to seIl
and Miao Υin got in the way.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.840
Plus, the skirmish you guys stumbled into.

26:33.008 --> 26:37.428
Lo Pan, the word is, ordered the boss of
the Chang Sings, Mr Lem Lee, assassinated.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.847
- That was his funeral.
- lt was a war, Eddie.

26:40.015 --> 26:44.477
- What are you doing here?
- Don't panic. It's onIy me, Gracie Law.

26:44.645 --> 26:45.728
Great.

26:45.896 --> 26:49.023
Just passing the neighborhood
on a dark and stormy night?

26:49.191 --> 26:52.193
- This is my neighborhood.
- Sure it was a war.

26:52.361 --> 26:53.569
And anybody that showed up

26:53.737 --> 26:56.614
was gonna join Lem Lee
in the helI of being cut to pieces.

26:56.782 --> 26:59.367
- HelI of being what?
- The Chinese have a lotta heIls.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.786
And what the helI is Gracie Law doing here?

27:01.954 --> 27:03.871
She can't get enough of me.

27:04.039 --> 27:06.541
He wishes. Look, you know me.

27:06.709 --> 27:10.044
l'm always pokin' my nose where it
doesn't belong and, I admit it,

27:10.212 --> 27:12.463
this mix-up is my fault, sort of.

27:12.631 --> 27:16.384
But I have it on good advice that the punks
that jumped me and took his truck,

27:16.552 --> 27:20.680
they took the girI they kidnapped to the
White Tiger's for a quick saIe. Who was she?

27:20.848 --> 27:25.268
- My fiancée. The White Tiger's?
- Oh, God. l'm sorry.

27:25.436 --> 27:28.980
lf we go tonight, we can buy her back.
A warrant's too complicated,

27:29.148 --> 27:31.816
- vioIence out of the question...
- Hold it! SIow down.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.360
- l'm feelin' like an outsider here.
- You are!

27:34.528 --> 27:37.905
Jack, listen. I need more of your heIp.
l can't pay you today, OK?

27:38.073 --> 27:40.491
- Shit.
- How can l? I need the cash for Miao Yin.

27:40.659 --> 27:45.413
- And it's gonna cost. She's got green eyes.
- Seriously? That's an extra.

27:45.581 --> 27:48.166
lt's Iike leather bucket seats:
doubIe the price.

27:48.334 --> 27:53.087
- Look, this Lo Pan I ran over... through...
- Has spirit-medium powers.

27:53.255 --> 27:58.051
Like the immortals.
His flesh and his bones are atomized.

27:58.218 --> 28:00.887
He becomes the dream.

28:01.055 --> 28:03.765
- What?
- That's an exaggeration, Jack, I promise.

28:03.932 --> 28:05.266
Please, heIp me.

28:05.642 --> 28:07.727
l got a great idea.

28:20.574 --> 28:22.617
- Relax.
- I am reIaxed.

28:22.785 --> 28:26.204
Look, this is as far as I go,
because l'm a dead giveaway, see?

28:26.372 --> 28:30.249
l'd go in there with you, but they know
my face and they'd wanna push it in.

28:30.417 --> 28:32.960
- Not whiIe I'm around.
- lt's alI up to you now, Jack.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.254
My destiny rests in your capable hands.

28:35.422 --> 28:37.965
- l'Il do my best.
- Make them drop their guard.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.634
- l'Il try.
- Look stupid.

28:39.802 --> 28:41.636
He does.

28:43.013 --> 28:45.723
Boy, it sure is rainin' cats and dogs.

28:46.642 --> 28:49.644
The cab driver said...
He toId me that I could...

28:49.812 --> 28:53.064
WeIl, that the White Tiger wouId...

28:54.233 --> 28:56.109
Just a minute, please.

29:02.241 --> 29:06.619
Excuse me for a second, guys.
l think I know that car.

29:11.291 --> 29:13.668
What's she doing now?

29:13.836 --> 29:15.670
Strange girl.

29:20.843 --> 29:23.344
That buiIding there. The White Tiger.

29:23.512 --> 29:27.348
God, it's creepy. Do we have to go in?
Because I wiIl, if we have to.

29:27.516 --> 29:30.768
l'Il go anywhere or do anything
to get my story. It's my big break.

29:30.936 --> 29:35.356
Just sit tight. We've got one of our
best men inside right now, stirring the pot.

29:50.581 --> 29:55.877
How do you do, ma'am? Henry Swanson's
my name and excitement's my game.

29:56.044 --> 29:59.297
- Cash or charge?
- Gosh! Cash, I guess.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.549
l mean, it's not deductibIe, is it?

30:03.927 --> 30:06.846
Mrs O'Toole wilI take care of your needs.

30:07.014 --> 30:09.056
Boy, I wish these were in coIor.

30:09.224 --> 30:12.894
Because what I reaIly am
in the mood for is a girl with green eyes.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.563
And price is no object, Mrs O'TooIe.

30:15.731 --> 30:19.734
Fresh off the boat's the way I like 'em.
The more exotic the better.

30:19.902 --> 30:22.570
Chinese girIs do not come with green eyes.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.883
- Too long. Let's go in.
- lt's only been ten minutes.

30:44.051 --> 30:46.093
Give the guy a chance.

30:48.472 --> 30:51.265
- So how Iong you been in the US of A?
- Three months.

30:51.433 --> 30:54.268
- Where from?
- Hong Kong.

30:54.436 --> 30:59.440
What happens? You stay here a while?
Old girls Ieave, new girls come in?

30:59.608 --> 31:03.277
Maybe. Take your tie off, pIease.

31:03.445 --> 31:06.614
Yeah, I know what you mean.
My wife gave it to me for Christmas.

31:10.744 --> 31:12.119
Holy shit!

32:44.338 --> 32:49.634
Green explosions? People fIyin' in and out?
That was not reaI. I wanna talk to the cops.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.678
l want my truck back.
Now where the helI am I?

32:52.846 --> 32:56.057
- My office. Sit down.
- You sIeep in your office?

32:56.224 --> 33:01.020
What I need to get straight is...
These Storms, what are they? Magicians?

33:01.188 --> 33:04.899
- Yeah, sort of. lt's hard to explain.
- Try reaI hard.

33:05.067 --> 33:07.902
lf the Storms have Miao Υin,
there's one place they'd go.

33:08.070 --> 33:12.114
Lo Pan. The godfather of Little China,
Mr David Lo Pan.

33:12.282 --> 33:15.409
You mean the Lo Pan that's
chairman of the National Orient Bank

33:15.577 --> 33:17.745
and owns the Wing Kong Trading Company,

33:17.913 --> 33:21.415
but who's so reclusive
that no one has laid eyes on him in years?

33:21.583 --> 33:23.918
Who the helI are you, anyway?

33:24.086 --> 33:27.546
l'm Margo Litzenberger.
I'm with the Berkeley People's Herald.

33:27.714 --> 33:32.051
l've been trying to get somebody from
the press to listen to me about this, Burton.

33:32.219 --> 33:37.056
lt's not possible that you saw David Lo Pan.
The bastard's afraid to show his face.

33:37.224 --> 33:40.059
- He's got more enemies...
- He's got Miao Yin. l'm going!

33:40.227 --> 33:42.436
- Are you nuts?
- Who's that?

33:42.604 --> 33:45.523
lt's OK, Tara. Υou can go back to sIeep.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.942
- From the airport.
- This morning, sure.

33:48.110 --> 33:52.571
That's why I was there. I was protecting her
civiI rights, making sure she gets a chance.

33:52.739 --> 33:56.617
This is just so shocking. I mean,
l must just be so monumentaIly naive.

33:56.785 --> 33:59.453
- You are.
- Now we have to grab your fiancée...

33:59.621 --> 34:02.164
Wait a minute! l'm a reasonabIe guy,

34:02.332 --> 34:04.792
but l've experienced
some unreasonabIe things.

34:04.960 --> 34:08.713
- lt depends on how you Iook at it.
- The helI it does! So somebody

34:08.880 --> 34:11.172
- teIl me what is goin' on!
- The truth?

34:11.341 --> 34:13.467
- I can take it.
- We don't know.

34:16.679 --> 34:20.433
- l'm going now, aIone if I have to!
- Where? lt's pouring out.

34:20.600 --> 34:24.186
- Lo Pan's. The Wing Kong Exchange.
- The Wing Kong Exchange?

34:24.353 --> 34:28.065
The most dangerous den of madmen
in Chinatown? You can't waltz in Iike...

34:28.233 --> 34:32.777
Like the wind. Yes, I can, Miss Law.
My mind and my spirits are as one.

34:32.946 --> 34:35.781
- As two. I said I was comin'.
- l'd go with you...

34:35.949 --> 34:38.784
l know. There's a probIem with your face.

34:38.952 --> 34:42.955
OK! You peopIe sit tight, hoId the fort
and keep the home fires burning.

34:43.123 --> 34:46.625
lf we're not back by dawn,
caIl the president.

34:56.428 --> 35:01.974
- This is gonna take crackerjack timing.
- Total concentration. Υou ready, Jack?

35:02.142 --> 35:04.185
l was born ready.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.357
l Iove working nights.

35:10.525 --> 35:12.485
Don't get up. Phone company.

35:12.652 --> 35:16.071
AlI right, boys, where's the main paneI?
ProbabIy through here.

35:24.998 --> 35:26.874
Wang.

35:35.759 --> 35:39.303
Good work, Jack.
l think they actuaIly felI for it.

35:41.723 --> 35:46.018
WeIl, last time we had this problem was
on account of squirrels chewin' the wires.

35:46.186 --> 35:50.231
- l'd better locate the central junction box.
- I think it's down there.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.821
What does that say?

35:56.988 --> 35:59.824
- HelI of boiling oiI.
- You're kidding!

35:59.991 --> 36:02.159
Yeah, I am. lt says "Keep out."

36:06.665 --> 36:09.124
We've got to do something!

36:13.922 --> 36:18.843
Goat butts against a hedge
and its horns become entangled.

36:19.803 --> 36:24.098
- I don't think l've had the pIeasure.
- Miss Gracie Law, Mr Egg Shen.

36:24.266 --> 36:26.767
Egg's kind of our IocaI authority on Lo Pan.

36:26.935 --> 36:29.436
- He's helping us out.
- lt has been almost two hours.

36:29.604 --> 36:32.857
- Let's go over there, beat down the door...
- No, Miss Law.

36:33.024 --> 36:38.112
We have to gather our strength,
because now there's cIouds and thunder.

36:38.280 --> 36:41.615
The image of difficulty at the beginning.

36:41.783 --> 36:45.452
But finalIy we shaIl bring order out of chaos.

36:50.625 --> 36:53.210
- Look.
- Yeah.

36:53.378 --> 36:56.255
What you got here is two
peopIe dragging a third.

36:56.423 --> 36:58.465
Miao Yin!

37:12.856 --> 37:16.483
- You did that, right?
- I guess so. I hope so.

37:22.198 --> 37:24.491
Jack, check this out.

37:25.785 --> 37:27.828
So what is this? Chinese or somethin'?

37:27.996 --> 37:30.581
- Countin' backwards?
- Not backwards. Downwards.

37:41.092 --> 37:46.013
Of course the Chinese mix everything up.
Look at what they have to work with.

37:46.181 --> 37:50.976
There's Buddhism, Confucianism
and Taoist alchemy and sorcery.

37:51.353 --> 37:55.522
We take what we want and leave the rest.
Just Iike your saIad bar.

37:55.690 --> 37:59.652
But there is one thing
even David Lo Pan must acknowledge.

37:59.819 --> 38:03.322
AlI movement in the universe
is caused by tension

38:03.490 --> 38:06.200
between positive and negative furies.

38:06.368 --> 38:10.704
- So when the furies are out of baIance...
- As they are in Lo Pan, who is cursed.

38:10.872 --> 38:13.999
Then the people
turn into demons and live for ever.

38:14.167 --> 38:18.420
Repulsive and evil,
existing only to pIague the Iiving.

38:18.588 --> 38:23.717
WeIl then, what you're saying is
this David Lo Pan... What is he? A ghost?

38:23.885 --> 38:29.848
Plays at being a man.
A creature of vast, dark, destructive power.

38:30.433 --> 38:35.479
AlI right, out this hatch and up the cabIe.
Does that sound like a briIliant idea or what?

38:35.647 --> 38:38.482
The cabIe is three stories high
and covered with grease.

38:38.650 --> 38:42.486
Exactly. It's reaI and we can touch it,
so at least we know where we stand.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.279
Yeah, in deep shit.

38:47.117 --> 38:49.702
- What?
- What the helI...?

38:51.579 --> 38:53.038
- Shit!
- See?

38:53.206 --> 38:56.041
You think they'd Iet us
walk in and out Iike the wind?

38:56.209 --> 38:58.836
Yes.
l thought that was your whoIe damn point!

38:59.004 --> 39:01.255
My point was to find Miao Yin at any cost!

39:01.423 --> 39:04.258
- This is saIt water, Wang.
- And get your truck back!

39:04.426 --> 39:08.053
- l'Il buy another one.
- But there's onIy one Miao Yin!

39:36.041 --> 39:38.083
Jesus Christ! Where are we?

39:38.251 --> 39:40.711
HelI of the upside-down sinners!

39:55.143 --> 39:59.271
Hey, you! Come on over here
and fight like a man!

40:38.520 --> 40:42.064
Shit, Jack. I don't like the Iooks of this.

40:44.734 --> 40:47.027
- Where are we, Wang?
- You are nowhere!

41:13.388 --> 41:15.222
Oh, boy.

41:15.390 --> 41:18.350
Look, we came here to see David Lo Pan,
aIl right?

41:19.060 --> 41:20.686
David Lo Pan?

41:20.854 --> 41:24.398
- Then you have succeeded, Mr Burton.
- What, you?

41:25.316 --> 41:28.402
- I don't get this at alI. I thought...
- Shut up, Mr Burton!

41:28.570 --> 41:32.614
- You are not put upon this worId to "get it".
- Come on! Lo Pan is like...

41:32.782 --> 41:34.575
Nothing you can understand.

41:34.742 --> 41:39.913
There are many mysteries and unanswerable
questions, even in a life as short as yours.

41:40.081 --> 41:43.667
The way I see it, it doesn't mean
we shouldn't ask. Where's my truck?

41:43.835 --> 41:48.130
You are not Iooking for a truck. You're
looking for a girl. A girI with green eyes.

41:48.298 --> 41:51.550
- Yes.
- She must be something extraordinary.

41:51.718 --> 41:54.261
Or l'm not about to waste
another 2,000 years.

41:54.429 --> 41:57.890
There can't be many Chinese girls
with green eyes these days.

41:58.057 --> 42:01.268
- There are not. Never were.
- So beggars can't be choosers.

42:01.436 --> 42:03.478
But I can!

42:04.272 --> 42:07.065
TeIl me about Miao Yin.

42:07.233 --> 42:09.484
What province is she from? Hunan?

42:10.195 --> 42:14.281
Her mother? Her father?
He must be a hoIy man. I must know.

42:14.449 --> 42:17.951
You got a tongue, Dave. Ask her yourseIf.

42:23.082 --> 42:27.794
Mr Burton, if you have an infIuence over
your youthful friend, you better exert it now.

42:27.962 --> 42:31.965
Otherwise I wiIl send both of you to
the helI where people are skinned alive.

42:32.133 --> 42:34.468
lt's that simple. Understand?

42:35.511 --> 42:39.223
- Are you crazy? ls that your probIem?
- No, he means it, Jack.

42:39.390 --> 42:44.436
My problem is this pIace.
This pIace is my tomb. l'm buried here.

42:44.604 --> 42:50.692
A young man, a king, a warrior,
is entombed in this old man's crippled body.

42:52.362 --> 42:54.821
And alI I need is a woman, Mr Burton,

42:54.989 --> 42:58.200
a special kind of woman
with dragon-green eyes,

42:58.368 --> 43:00.327
to make me whole and young again,

43:00.495 --> 43:03.705
so that I may
ruIe the universe from beyond the grave.

43:03.873 --> 43:07.125
- Ch'ing-ti. The God of the East.
- Who, him? This guy?

43:07.293 --> 43:09.253
No, not me, Mr Burton.

43:10.630 --> 43:15.175
My demon. The god I must appease
in order to regain my heart, my bIood.

43:15.802 --> 43:19.471
A girI with green eyes to satisfy Ch'ing-ti,

43:19.639 --> 43:22.432
a girI brave enough
to embrace the naked bIade.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.726
- When I find her, I wilI marry her.
- Never!

43:24.894 --> 43:27.229
Ch'ing-ti wilI be happy and my curse lifted.

43:27.397 --> 43:30.148
You can ruIe the universe
from beyond the grave.

43:30.316 --> 43:32.651
- lndeed!
- Or check into a psycho ward.

43:32.819 --> 43:35.153
Whichever comes first.

43:35.321 --> 43:36.989
What, I'm supposed to buy this shit?

43:37.156 --> 43:40.117
2,000 years
and he can't find a broad to fit the bilI?

43:40.285 --> 43:43.328
Come on, Dave, you must be doin'
somethin' seriousIy wrong.

43:43.496 --> 43:49.126
There have been others, to be sure.
There are aIways others, are there not?

43:49.294 --> 43:53.380
You seem to be one who knows
the difficulties between men and women,

43:53.548 --> 43:55.882
how seIdom it works out.

43:56.426 --> 43:59.803
And yet we aIl keep trying, like fools.

44:01.889 --> 44:07.644
Who are these peopIe? Friends of yours?
Now this realIy pisses me off to no end!

44:07.812 --> 44:11.315
- Come on, stick around!
- Where's Miao Υin? ln this buiIding?

44:11.482 --> 44:13.025
- Safe.
- Where is she?

44:13.192 --> 44:16.695
Safe.
Safer with me than any creature on earth!

44:18.197 --> 44:21.158
Go ahead. You want bad pubIicity?
Give us the run-around.

44:21.326 --> 44:25.412
But this woman has a deadline,
and her pen is mightier than your sword.

44:25.580 --> 44:28.332
- Yeah.
- No visitors.

44:28.499 --> 44:32.753
- I don't make the policy around here.
- Come on, man! Give 'em a tour.

44:32.920 --> 44:35.255
What's it gonna hurt?

44:36.341 --> 44:38.592
l can help you.

45:07.580 --> 45:10.082
- Are you OK, Jack?
- Yeah.

45:12.335 --> 45:16.338
We're in a room.
No windows, a few skeIetons.

45:16.506 --> 45:19.591
- Where's the Iight coming from?
- The floor.

45:35.024 --> 45:38.568
With the easing of trade restrictions,

45:38.736 --> 45:43.573
next year we'Il start importing
a Iot of strange things from Peking.

45:43.741 --> 45:46.660
What sort of strange things?

45:46.828 --> 45:49.162
Are we going up or down?

45:49.330 --> 45:51.415
lt feeIs Iike down.

46:11.144 --> 46:13.603
Great. Thank you, Jack.

46:13.771 --> 46:18.733
l think we've come up. First we went down.
Now they've brought us up.

46:19.819 --> 46:24.698
Two, three feet thick, I'lI bet. Probably
welded shut and covered with brick by now.

46:24.866 --> 46:28.702
- Don't give up, Jack.
- OK. Let's just chew our way outta here!

46:28.870 --> 46:31.413
Lo Pan has plans for us,
or we'd be dead doornails.

46:31.581 --> 46:36.626
Which Lo Pan? LittIe old basket case
on wheeIs, or the ten-foot-taIl roadblock?

46:36.794 --> 46:41.673
- One and the same person, Jack.
- You know something you're not telIin' me.

46:41.841 --> 46:44.217
Myths and Iegends.

46:44.969 --> 46:48.263
- I don't wanna insult you.
- No, no. Go ahead.

46:49.098 --> 46:50.682
lnsult me.

46:52.643 --> 46:56.062
lt's about aIl sorts of scary things:
an ancient army of the dead,

46:56.230 --> 46:59.733
the Spirit City and monkey sacrifices.

46:59.901 --> 47:01.985
The First Sovereign Emperor of China,

47:02.153 --> 47:06.072
that mad monarch who federated our
seven warring states, defeated Lo Pan

47:06.240 --> 47:11.453
and imposed upon him
that horribIe curse of no fIesh in 272 BC.

47:12.371 --> 47:16.750
A lot of Chinese hear these things
when we're kids, then we grow up,

47:17.710 --> 47:19.836
and pretend not to believe them.

47:20.421 --> 47:23.256
- No horseshit, Wang.
- No horseshit, Jack.

47:23.424 --> 47:28.762
l don't bIame you. I'm Chinese and I don't
even wanna believe it, but it's for reaI.

47:28.930 --> 47:31.389
Sorcery, the Chinese black magic.

47:36.771 --> 47:38.855
Blindfolds!

47:57.959 --> 48:00.085
You make one move...

48:06.259 --> 48:10.136
Now, Iet's try that again.
Don't make me kilI you, tough guy.

48:11.973 --> 48:13.932
Come on, Jack!

48:14.392 --> 48:16.476
- Come on!
- How?

49:10.990 --> 49:12.949
- Great work, Jack.
- Yeah.

49:13.117 --> 49:15.035
We're aIl in: me, Gracie and Margo.

49:15.202 --> 49:18.288
Uncle Chu and Egg
are in Egg's bus, ready to get us out.

49:18.456 --> 49:19.873
- Right.
- Here, Jack.

49:20.041 --> 49:22.083
l'Il trade ya.

49:23.294 --> 49:25.795
AlI right, which way?
Fast, before they wake up.

49:25.963 --> 49:28.548
There, I think. Down there.

49:34.889 --> 49:36.973
No pathetic excuses.

49:37.975 --> 49:44.064
l smeIl the blood of human beings. Find
them. BoiI them untiI their fIesh falIs off.

49:44.357 --> 49:46.107
You heard me!

50:42.832 --> 50:44.916
Empty.

50:47.253 --> 50:49.921
l need you, Miao Yin.

50:50.339 --> 50:54.801
You, whose eyes flash
like emerald lightning.

50:55.970 --> 50:59.931
Ch'ing-ti, make me flesh again soon.

51:02.017 --> 51:03.476
Please.

51:05.271 --> 51:07.147
Let's go. lt's cIear.

51:12.987 --> 51:15.071
Safety!

51:18.951 --> 51:20.535
Wang!

51:26.459 --> 51:29.169
First time you ever plugged somebody?

51:29.795 --> 51:31.755
- Course not.
- Come on!

51:33.591 --> 51:35.341
You wanna go up or down?

51:35.509 --> 51:37.594
- Up or down?
- Up.

52:00.284 --> 52:04.287
AlI has become strange.

52:05.247 --> 52:11.169
A worId so unreaI and yet,
at once, so frightening.

52:34.693 --> 52:37.654
Open up or l'lI bIow his head off!

52:40.825 --> 52:43.701
Open! Or he dies in the name of Ch'ing-ti

52:43.869 --> 52:47.705
and your souIs speed with his
to the heIl of the oily dragon!

53:14.900 --> 53:17.068
- You alI right?
- Yeah.

53:21.782 --> 53:23.616
- Margo!
- Jack!

53:23.784 --> 53:27.453
- Where's Gracie?
- On the fIoor next door. She's a wildcat.

53:27.621 --> 53:31.291
- How are you gonna spring us?
- I have no idea.

54:08.829 --> 54:11.331
That way maybe.

54:14.919 --> 54:17.003
Wang, haul ass!

54:31.810 --> 54:33.728
Come on, keep movin'!

54:35.356 --> 54:36.898
Margo, jump in!

54:38.567 --> 54:40.860
- ln there? Are you nuts?
- Go!

55:12.184 --> 55:14.686
- Where's Margo?
- I don't know.

55:18.065 --> 55:19.065
Where are we?

55:19.233 --> 55:21.401
- Where's Eddie?
- Beats me.

55:24.530 --> 55:26.614
Where's Jack?

55:28.450 --> 55:30.535
Jack!

55:32.496 --> 55:34.580
Jack?

55:36.583 --> 55:38.668
Jack!

55:41.880 --> 55:47.260
- Sorry, l'm just thrilIed to be aIive.
- Yeah, sure. Let's go.

55:54.101 --> 55:57.687
- lt's Iike some giant garbage disposal.
- I think it is, sort of.

55:57.855 --> 56:01.774
WilI you just stop rubbing
your body up against mine?

56:01.942 --> 56:03.985
l can't concentrate when you do that.

56:04.153 --> 56:08.114
What a pig you are, Burton! I mean, realIy!

56:10.659 --> 56:14.620
- Where's Jack?
- lt's OK. Everybody reIax. I'm here.

56:14.788 --> 56:18.124
Jack, I know where we are.
This is a central... what do you calI it?

56:18.292 --> 56:20.960
- Sewer?
- Yeah. Water comes in up there.

56:21.128 --> 56:23.296
Seawater from the bay fiIls this room.

56:23.464 --> 56:25.798
They divert it
through pipes to different chambers.

56:25.966 --> 56:29.469
l bet up there's where
we first got on that elevator.

56:57.206 --> 57:00.666
AlI right, we're aImost outta here.
From here on, it gets normaI.

57:00.834 --> 57:02.960
Offices, storerooms: a nice false front.

57:03.128 --> 57:06.547
l count to three, open the door, and we go.

57:06.715 --> 57:08.591
- Everybody got that?
- Ready?

57:08.759 --> 57:11.219
FoIlow the Ieader. One, two, three.

57:15.224 --> 57:16.974
We may be trapped.

57:20.020 --> 57:22.313
Hide!

57:22.481 --> 57:26.192
- Hide?
- Hide! They onIy saw me!

57:30.072 --> 57:32.615
We fight together, Jack. Do or die.

58:23.542 --> 58:25.084
Time to go.

58:29.840 --> 58:32.967
The bus is right outside in the parking Iot.

58:54.156 --> 58:58.951
Here's the deaI. I run interference and
you bring up the rear. Can you handIe that?

58:59.119 --> 59:00.119
Can you?

59:00.662 --> 59:04.081
WeIl, what a night's work!
You got a probIem like that again,

59:04.249 --> 59:07.043
- you reach for the sky!
- Let's go!

59:09.296 --> 59:11.380
Come on, come on.

59:12.591 --> 59:15.718
- You're doin' real good, guys.
- Come on, Jack!

59:17.638 --> 59:20.348
Let's go! Open the doors!

59:23.769 --> 59:25.895
- Hurry!
- Move it, Egg!

59:27.522 --> 59:29.440
Duck!

59:45.499 --> 59:48.626
We made it. HoIy shit, we made it!

59:49.294 --> 59:52.171
- Where's Miao Υin?
- lnside.

59:52.756 --> 59:54.465
Somewhere inside.

59:57.511 --> 59:59.136
Where's Gracie?

01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:18.739
Put me down, you overstuffed monster!

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:25.705
Let me go! Let me go!

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:05.911
What does it mean?

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:08.706
Two girls with green eyes?

01:01:08.874 --> 01:01:10.916
After alI these years.

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:16.589
You bastards! Unchain me! You're not
gonna get away with this. Where's Lo Pan?

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.718
This one has fire as welI!

01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:24.722
Listen,
l've had it up to here with you maniacs.

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:28.934
l wanna see that disgusting
flesh-peddIer David Lo Pan in person.

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:34.106
Unless the coward's afraid to see
an unarmed girI one-on-one!

01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:36.734
Where is he?

01:01:45.994 --> 01:01:50.831
You know what this is? This is Iike
some radical Αlice ln Wonderland.

01:01:50.999 --> 01:01:52.083
That's what this is.

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:55.086
Then you've got a best selIer on your hands.

01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:57.963
CalI the police. You're not a one-man army.

01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:01.175
Cops got better things to do than get kiIled.

01:02:04.596 --> 01:02:06.305
Here he is, Jack.

01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:10.059
No, these are our friends.
These are the Chang Sings.

01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:13.437
- Any of 'em savvy EngIish?
- Hey, man. Who is this guy?

01:02:13.605 --> 01:02:15.356
AlI right. You got any guns?

01:02:15.524 --> 01:02:20.903
Not against Lo Pan, but here's one for you
to make you feel better, like Dirty Harry.

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:24.073
l'Il stick with these.
You comin' with us, Egg?

01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:29.078
Of course, Jack. lt's my destiny. Besides,
if I don't you'Il never make it out alive.

01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:31.747
- l'm on board too then.
- Yeah, sure, kid.

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:35.584
- You can't keep the press out. It's America.
- You're not going back there.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:38.254
You're stayin' here
with Eddie and UncIe Chu.

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:41.424
- Eddie? But he's...
- He's got a crush on you.

01:02:41.842 --> 01:02:44.301
-You mean Iike you've got on Gracie?
-Are you kidding?

01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:46.095
l just want my truck back.

01:02:46.263 --> 01:02:49.515
What do I know?
She's not even your type. AlI brains.

01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:51.725
Come on, Iet's go!

01:03:00.444 --> 01:03:04.196
Play your cards right,
you live to talk about it.

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:29.221
Oh, boy.

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:33.434
Are you OK? Are you Miao Yin?

01:03:33.602 --> 01:03:36.854
Yes. Miao Υin.

01:03:37.189 --> 01:03:39.899
- Who are you?
- Lo Pan.

01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:43.527
You have come to seek me out
with your green eyes.

01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:45.654
Yes.

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:47.740
- No, no.
- Yes.

01:03:49.618 --> 01:03:55.206
- What's going on here? Some kind of...?
- Magic. The darkest magic.

01:03:55.373 --> 01:04:01.629
My souI swims in it, scattered across time,
trapped in the world of formIessness.

01:04:02.047 --> 01:04:06.008
UntiI I find her and marry her.

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:07.468
Marry her?

01:04:07.636 --> 01:04:12.806
The girl with green eyes.
The girl who can tame the burning blade.

01:04:14.893 --> 01:04:19.313
Miao Yin or Grace Law.

01:04:29.741 --> 01:04:33.953
- Great start. It's the other way.
- The front door wilI get you nowhere.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:35.204
Here, Iet me hoId that.

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:37.623
A brave man Iikes to feel nature on his face.

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:41.043
And a wise man has enough sense
to get in out of the rain.

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:55.808
- He lives here?
- He owns the bIock. He's a rich guy.

01:04:55.976 --> 01:04:59.228
- Rich? This place is a dump, Wang.
- To Western eyes.

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:02.273
The stuff in these bottles is priceless.

01:05:03.608 --> 01:05:06.610
WeIl, aIl set?

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:10.197
Yeah. Ready when you are, Egg.

01:05:29.509 --> 01:05:31.343
- Jack next.
- Where does it go?

01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:34.346
- Down. Lo Pan is down there.
- Down where?

01:05:34.514 --> 01:05:37.433
- Where is the universe?
- Come on, Jack. Don't be afraid.

01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:39.643
Afraid? Are you kidding?

01:05:53.867 --> 01:05:58.162
- Where in the helI are we?
- Underneath Chinatown.

01:06:58.765 --> 01:07:01.058
That is not water.

01:07:01.226 --> 01:07:03.602
Black blood of the earth.

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:07.940
- Do you mean oiI?
- I mean bIack bIood of the earth.

01:07:08.108 --> 01:07:13.320
A thousand years ago, huge earthquakes
turned the worId upside down.

01:07:15.573 --> 01:07:18.075
Many normaI peopIe were kilIed.

01:07:20.328 --> 01:07:24.373
Many unnatural people roam free

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:29.086
to commit great offenses against the gods.

01:09:15.443 --> 01:09:20.447
They have survived the burning blade,
tamed the savage heart.

01:09:23.283 --> 01:09:25.577
l wiIl marry both women.

01:09:27.538 --> 01:09:30.122
Prepare them.

01:09:44.721 --> 01:09:46.807
What is that?

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:52.437
- lt sounds Iike...
- Something breathing underwater?

01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:54.273
Yeah.

01:10:04.075 --> 01:10:06.118
You wilI come out no more!

01:10:06.286 --> 01:10:09.872
What? What'lI come out no more?

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:12.207
Come on.

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:14.418
Dammit!

01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:29.308
Miao Yin?

01:11:07.889 --> 01:11:09.973
Hey, Wang!

01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:12.684
- Egg!
- Jack, come on!

01:11:27.492 --> 01:11:30.869
lt's OK, Jack. Wing Kong storeroom.
Emergency provisions.

01:11:31.037 --> 01:11:33.914
We're inside Lo Pan's domain.

01:11:34.082 --> 01:11:35.958
Christ!

01:11:38.753 --> 01:11:39.836
Later.

01:11:40.004 --> 01:11:44.633
We're getting cIose. Real cIose.
And now for some more bad news. Ready?

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:49.137
- This gets worse? Come on!
- 2,258 years ago

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:51.765
the First Sovereign Emperor...

01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:56.853
He subjugated Lo Pan,
made him of no fIesh.

01:11:57.897 --> 01:12:01.733
- OnIy an eviI dream.
- Get to the goddamn point, Egg.

01:12:01.901 --> 01:12:06.989
ln order to be whoIe again, he had to find
this certain girl of his prophecy,

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:09.741
and marry her to appease
the God of the East.

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:12.953
But to appease the emperor,
he had to kilI her.

01:12:13.121 --> 01:12:14.871
KiIl her? No!

01:12:15.039 --> 01:12:19.084
WeIl, let's go. What are we taIkin'
Chinese history for when we gotta get...

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:22.671
We are getting ready
to strike the finaI bIow.

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:26.425
- lf we reach Lo Pan...
- When we reach Lo Pan.

01:12:26.592 --> 01:12:29.261
..then the power in this fIask
wilI be our onIy hope

01:12:29.429 --> 01:12:34.349
against the Bodhisattva of the underworld,
the uItimate evil spirit.

01:12:35.435 --> 01:12:39.438
Yes. Only a dream can kiIl a dream.

01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:42.691
l've waited for this for a Iong time, Jack.

01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:46.528
The evil dream wiIl die.

01:12:52.952 --> 01:12:54.119
Wing Kong outside.

01:13:20.938 --> 01:13:24.441
- Were they reaI?
- Yeah. Dressed for Lo Pan's wedding.

01:13:24.609 --> 01:13:26.610
What's in the fIask? Magic potion?

01:13:26.778 --> 01:13:29.154
- Yeah.
- Thought so. Good. Do we drink it?

01:13:29.322 --> 01:13:31.031
- Yeah.
- Good. Thought so.

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:11.863
l am the past,
come back to haunt you, Lo Pan!

01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:18.537
My God, no! PIease!
What is that? Don't teIl me.

01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:22.999
A guardian. What it sees, Lo Pan knows.

01:14:23.167 --> 01:14:25.460
They have returned.

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:29.714
And this time they are not aIone.
Egg Shen is with them.

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:35.470
Little bastard sorcerer has brought them
through the Bog of the Dead Trees.

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:37.222
Egg Shen?

01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:42.310
Egg Shen! You have come
a Iong ways to find me, but it is too Iate.

01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:46.731
There are two girls with green eyes,
and I wiIl marry them both.

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:50.152
And then I wiIl sacrifice Gracie Law
to appease my emperor,

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:54.531
and Iive out my earthIy pIeasures
with Miao Yin.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.412
That's right, Egg Shen.
The best of two worIds.

01:15:07.295 --> 01:15:09.838
You never know tiIl you try.

01:15:10.006 --> 01:15:12.048
Let's get outta here.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:25.353
You know what I don't Iike?
Where is everybody?

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:27.772
Preparing for Lo Pan's wedding.

01:15:38.326 --> 01:15:42.078
We should not be in here, not this easily.
lt's a setup, I'm telIin' ya.

01:15:42.246 --> 01:15:45.624
Lo Pan is about to take his queen.
He's too busy to care.

01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:48.501
So where is he, Egg? Where?

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:22.160
- Jack, here!
- What?

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:27.832
- HolIow.
- Fuck it.

01:16:32.463 --> 01:16:36.132
- I know. It's an elevator. lt only goes down.
- Yeah, look.

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:40.178
- Hey, aIl right!
- Time for the medicine!

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:51.523
- Cheers!
- This does what again, exactIy?

01:16:51.691 --> 01:16:54.276
Huge buzz.

01:16:55.194 --> 01:16:57.028
Good!

01:16:57.196 --> 01:17:01.366
You can see things no one eIse can see,
do things no one eIse can do.

01:17:01.534 --> 01:17:03.785
- ReaI things?
- As reaI as Lo Pan.

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:07.956
- What more can a guy ask for?
- The six-demon bag!

01:17:08.124 --> 01:17:11.793
Terrific. A six-demon bag.
SensationaI. What's in it, Egg?

01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:14.671
Wind! Fire! AIl that kind of thing.

01:17:14.839 --> 01:17:17.257
Here's to the army and navy
and the battIes they have won.

01:17:17.425 --> 01:17:20.051
Here's to America's colors,
the coIors that never run.

01:17:20.219 --> 01:17:22.887
May the wings of Iiberty
never lose a feather.

01:17:37.945 --> 01:17:41.323
l feel pretty good. You know, I'm not...

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:44.451
l'm not scared at alI. I just feeI kind of...

01:17:45.453 --> 01:17:48.163
- I feel kind of invincible.
- Me too.

01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:52.250
- I got a very positive attitude about this.
- Good. Me too.

01:17:58.090 --> 01:18:00.633
ls it gettin' hot in here, or is it just me?

01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:03.845
Ch'ing-ti! Ch'ing-ti!

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:08.350
Great Ch'ing-ti, equaI with heaven,

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:14.439
come into our presence
and witness this hoIy matrimony.

01:18:14.607 --> 01:18:18.234
- Miao Yin.
- And the ultimate eviI spirit.

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:26.910
And now, my beloved disciples,

01:18:27.078 --> 01:18:29.412
the moment of truth.

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:32.082
The needIe of Iove.

01:18:35.586 --> 01:18:38.546
- l'd like to shoot that bastard.
- Not untiI he's married.

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:41.257
- Then he's fIesh.
- Then it's too late.

01:18:41.425 --> 01:18:43.593
Ch'ing-ti!

01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:48.473
You, who shake the heavens
and descend from the east,

01:18:48.641 --> 01:18:52.268
aIl I ask in order to conquer this universe

01:18:52.436 --> 01:18:56.773
is that you grant me flesh and blood.

01:18:58.567 --> 01:19:01.694
Yes! Guide my hand

01:19:02.488 --> 01:19:06.658
as I insert this needle into Miao Yin.

01:19:07.535 --> 01:19:11.329
Let him compIete the ceremony.
Then he is ours for certain!

01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:14.040
Come, my love. Give it to me.

01:19:27.221 --> 01:19:29.139
lt's working!

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:32.851
l'm mortal!

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:43.278
Look out, guys!

01:19:58.878 --> 01:20:00.545
No way!

01:21:04.068 --> 01:21:06.361
Come, Miao Υin, it won't hurt.

01:22:07.214 --> 01:22:08.673
Shit!

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:18.224
Take her.

01:22:41.248 --> 01:22:43.541
Peasant magic!

01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:20.995
You never couId beat me, Egg Shen.

01:24:27.271 --> 01:24:28.688
- lt's me.
- Are you alI right?

01:24:28.856 --> 01:24:31.941
- Never mind me. We gotta get Lo Pan.
- Where is he?

01:24:32.109 --> 01:24:33.401
Wang!

01:24:33.569 --> 01:24:35.319
Come on.

01:24:37.322 --> 01:24:39.407
PuIl it apart. Come on!

01:25:06.602 --> 01:25:10.855
- Where does this go?
- Up. To Lo Pan's office. lt's cooler up there.

01:25:11.023 --> 01:25:14.025
- From there we can...
- Do you have a gun, I hope?

01:25:14.193 --> 01:25:17.528
- I have a knife.
- A knife? He's 12 feet talI!

01:25:17.696 --> 01:25:20.948
Seven. Don't worry.
l can handIe him. I took something.

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:23.743
l can see things no one else can see.

01:25:24.995 --> 01:25:28.539
- Why are you dressed like that?
- I was getting married.

01:25:28.707 --> 01:25:33.836
He was marrying both of us,
just because my eyes are green too.

01:25:43.096 --> 01:25:45.681
Oh, God. ls this reaIly happening?

01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:56.192
- Look into my eyes.
- No! Never!

01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:00.196
l have suffered so much pain and agony.
Look at me!

01:26:00.364 --> 01:26:04.075
No! I don't understand.
l don't belong to you!

01:26:04.243 --> 01:26:07.995
No, you don't. Υou belong to Ch'ing-ti.

01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:10.915
l must sacrifice you,
but I Iove you and I need you.

01:26:11.083 --> 01:26:13.209
No!

01:26:13.377 --> 01:26:15.503
Here, take her! Take the bitch!

01:26:15.671 --> 01:26:18.464
- Master, you are flesh!
- I am?

01:26:19.091 --> 01:26:22.051
l am! lt worked!

01:26:22.219 --> 01:26:24.971
Ch'ing-ti is appeased.

01:26:25.347 --> 01:26:30.601
Now we must satisfy the First
Sovereign Emperor by destroying this!

01:26:30.769 --> 01:26:32.937
Not so fast, gentIemen.

01:26:33.105 --> 01:26:36.691
ls it too much to ask, Thunder?
KiIl him! For me!

01:26:36.859 --> 01:26:41.612
lt won't soIve anything, Dave. Too many
peopIe have been droppin' like fIies aIready

01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:45.324
and where's that gettin' us? Nowhere, fast.

01:26:45.492 --> 01:26:48.828
Nah, you know what Jack Burton
aIways says at a time Iike this?

01:26:48.996 --> 01:26:51.956
- Who?
- Jack Burton. Me!

01:27:00.299 --> 01:27:02.466
Old Jack aIways says

01:27:02.968 --> 01:27:05.094
"What the heIl?"

01:27:30.871 --> 01:27:32.330
lt's a good knife.

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:36.626
Goodbye, Mr Burton.

01:28:00.859 --> 01:28:03.361
lt's alI in the refIexes.

01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:08.199
Wang!

01:28:15.874 --> 01:28:18.000
You alI right?

01:28:18.168 --> 01:28:20.294
- Hey, thanks.
- Wait a minute.

01:28:56.039 --> 01:28:58.124
l don't think he's gonna stop!

01:29:02.462 --> 01:29:03.963
Come on!

01:29:23.817 --> 01:29:26.277
- We got a problem.
- There!

01:29:58.018 --> 01:30:00.436
Come on, Jack!

01:30:02.355 --> 01:30:04.440
Jump, Jack!

01:30:14.576 --> 01:30:17.453
- This whole pIace is meIting!
- HelIo! HeIlo!

01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:22.458
- How'd you get up there?
- lt wasn't easy! Stand aside!

01:30:27.172 --> 01:30:29.381
Take it away!

01:30:48.985 --> 01:30:50.903
Hang onto this.

01:30:53.115 --> 01:30:55.116
Watch out, Wang Chi!

01:31:04.584 --> 01:31:06.669
Go for it, Wang!

01:31:27.399 --> 01:31:30.276
- Go!
- Come on, Jack, hurry!

01:31:32.279 --> 01:31:34.822
There's my truck... My truck!

01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:37.408
Get in.

01:31:58.972 --> 01:32:01.056
- They took the key.
- Do you have a spare?

01:32:01.224 --> 01:32:04.101
Course I do, but it's underneath the...

01:32:06.688 --> 01:32:10.482
- What was that?
- 6.9 on the Richter scaIe. Hang on!

01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:21.452
- Sorry.
- Don't you know how to drive this thing?

01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:23.162
Relax.

01:32:37.177 --> 01:32:39.470
Stop! Red Iight!

01:32:43.642 --> 01:32:46.101
Take it easy. OK, we made it.

01:32:47.646 --> 01:32:48.729
Yeah.

01:32:48.897 --> 01:32:52.942
Look at that.
Doesn't that make you feeI good?

01:32:53.109 --> 01:32:55.152
Terrific.

01:32:56.446 --> 01:32:58.739
The light's green. You can go.

01:33:17.342 --> 01:33:20.427
- What are you doin', Jack?
- l'Il be right back.

01:33:20.595 --> 01:33:23.055
Where are you goin', Egg?

01:33:23.765 --> 01:33:25.849
My work's done.

01:33:26.559 --> 01:33:30.521
Lo Pan is dead
and the evil speIl's been lifted.

01:33:31.648 --> 01:33:35.025
Years ago I promised myseIf
a Iong vacation.

01:33:35.193 --> 01:33:37.152
lt is time to coIlect.

01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:40.447
WeIl, why don't you go on over to China?
Visit the motherland?

01:33:40.615 --> 01:33:45.286
WeIl, China's in the heart, Jack.
Wherever I go, she's with me.

01:33:47.789 --> 01:33:52.042
- So what are you gonna caIl it?
- I don't know.

01:33:52.210 --> 01:33:57.339
Maybe you can come over to my place Iater
and help me find a title?

01:33:59.426 --> 01:34:02.636
- Here, Jack. Nothin' or triple.
- Nothin' or doubIe.

01:34:02.804 --> 01:34:05.514
Triple. You earned it.

01:34:05.849 --> 01:34:08.559
You're right, I did. Thanks, Wang.

01:34:11.771 --> 01:34:14.315
WeIl, last chance. l'm a rich man now.

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:18.277
l can give up the open road,
seIl my truck, settIe down.

01:34:18.778 --> 01:34:21.322
CouIdn't have that on my conscience.

01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:24.241
The only way it might work
is if you buy a bigger truck

01:34:24.409 --> 01:34:27.828
with a cozy littIe apartment
in back, just big enough for two.

01:34:27.996 --> 01:34:33.334
That sounds pretty great. But sooner or Iater
l rub everybody the wrong way.

01:34:35.337 --> 01:34:37.629
WeIl, let me think about it.

01:34:41.343 --> 01:34:45.179
God, aren't you even

01:34:48.975 --> 01:34:50.517
No.

01:35:42.487 --> 01:35:46.156
and the rain's comin' down
in sheets thick as lead.

01:35:46.324 --> 01:35:49.243
Remember what oId Jack Burton does
when the earth quakes

01:35:49.411 --> 01:35:54.248
and the poison arrows faIl from the sky
and the piIlars of heaven shake.

01:35:54.416 --> 01:35:59.169
