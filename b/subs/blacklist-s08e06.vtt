WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:03.336
They were going to move it upstairs.

00:03.420 --> 00:08.717
"Not expressly stated."
Five letters, second one is an "A."

00:10.593 --> 00:11.845
How about "tacit"?

00:13.138 --> 00:17.225
No wonder I haven't finished crosswords
since you moved in with Max.

00:17.308 --> 00:18.852
How is he, by the way?

00:18.935 --> 00:22.605
-I wouldn't know. We broke up.
-What? How did I not know?

00:22.689 --> 00:25.567
-When did he move out?
-He didn't. His parents own the place.

00:25.650 --> 00:28.153
I'm staying on the pullout in the office.

00:28.236 --> 00:30.989
-You're sleeping in your restaurant?
-It's just temporary.

00:31.823 --> 00:35.326
Come sleep on my couch.
I'll help you binge-eat past Max.

00:35.410 --> 00:38.288
And you can help me figure out
the three-letter word for:

00:38.371 --> 00:39.831
-"It has benefits."
-[door opens]

00:39.914 --> 00:41.916
[dramatic music playing]

00:45.086 --> 00:47.046
-Uh... Give me a minute?
-Mm-hm.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.304
[cell phone ringing]

00:56.514 --> 00:57.432
This is Park.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.100
[speaking indistinctly]

00:59.184 --> 01:00.685
[Park] Yes. Of course.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.822
Sir, I'm sorry. Can you hold
for just one moment?

01:13.490 --> 01:15.408
Hey, everything okay?

01:15.492 --> 01:19.287
-Landlord troubles. Story of my life.
-Didn't look like landlord trouble.

01:19.370 --> 01:20.538
J-O-B.

01:21.164 --> 01:25.210
Three across. "It has benefits."
The answer is "job." Go do yours.

01:25.293 --> 01:27.170
[scoffs] I'll call you tonight.

01:36.638 --> 01:37.889
Agent Park.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.935
Why is it the really wealthy
always want to own a restaurant?

01:42.018 --> 01:47.398
I'm sure for some it has a lot to do
with glad-handing and backslapping.

01:47.482 --> 01:51.528
For me, it was sort of a friend in need.

01:51.611 --> 01:54.322
Now it's a project. We're expanding.

01:54.405 --> 01:59.661
And this, an office, with a stove and
a walk-in. Hungry? I could make an omelet.

01:59.744 --> 02:01.371
-No, thank you, I ate.
-Coffee?

02:01.454 --> 02:04.415
Cooper's tied up at Main Justice.
He said you had a case.

02:04.499 --> 02:07.460
What do you know about
the Nuremberg trials?

02:07.544 --> 02:10.088
Military tribunals after World War II.

02:10.171 --> 02:13.216
Allied Forces prosecuting
Nazi leadership for war crimes.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.677
They gave the devil his day in court

02:15.760 --> 02:19.013
and invented
simultaneous translation to do it.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.266
Are you giving me a case
or a history lesson?

02:21.349 --> 02:26.437
If it weren't for the Allies' desire
to give Göring a fair trial,

02:26.521 --> 02:29.399
the Wellstone Agency might not exist.

02:29.482 --> 02:34.362
In fact, it doesn't exist,
not officially, and yet its services

02:34.445 --> 02:39.367
have made thousands of illicit
business transactions possible.

02:39.450 --> 02:43.037
-A translation service for crooks.
-Crime is a global trade.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.039
Criminals need to communicate,

02:45.123 --> 02:48.543
and that requires
interpreters they can trust.

02:48.626 --> 02:51.462
The Wellstone Agency provides just that.

02:52.088 --> 02:53.298
A bunch of translators.

02:53.381 --> 02:59.053
I believe Agent Keen
recently acquired Wellstone's services.

02:59.137 --> 03:03.933
If we find the interpreter she used,
we may be able to find her.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.812
Why come to us? You're a criminal.
Haven't you used this company?

03:07.896 --> 03:09.022
I have.

03:09.522 --> 03:14.944
But my point person and I
recently had a falling out.

03:15.028 --> 03:19.240
And without him, I have no way
to reach the senior leadership.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.826
I need your help
to get inside the company.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.287
Have you considered
simply leaving Keen alone?

03:24.370 --> 03:26.956
Taking a breath
to consider your role in all this.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.501
Harold isn't in the meeting, is he?

03:30.585 --> 03:31.419
[cell phone buzzing]

03:31.502 --> 03:35.423
[Park] No. I came here to tell you
I think what you're doing is wrong.

03:36.090 --> 03:38.218
You're making things worse
by pursuing her.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.637
It's Paula. Glen's mother.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.389
She says she needs to see you.
Says it's urgent.

03:44.515 --> 03:50.230
Agent Park, next time you feel
the urge to unburden yourself,

03:50.313 --> 03:53.316
you can rest assured,
I've heard it all before.

03:53.399 --> 03:56.569
It's a luxury to stand
on the moral high ground

03:56.653 --> 03:59.197
and critique those of us
on the low ground.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.699
A lot of people do exactly that.

04:02.867 --> 04:06.120
-Until they need my help.
-I'll never ask for your help.

04:06.204 --> 04:09.290
And yet here I am asking for yours.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.459
The Wellstone Agency.

04:11.542 --> 04:13.670
It's the next name on the Blacklist.

04:21.552 --> 04:25.348
According to Reddington, the agency's
inner workings are cloaked in secrecy.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.810
Their interpreters are kept in the dark
as to who runs the organization.

04:28.893 --> 04:30.186
So how do they communicate?

04:30.270 --> 04:32.647
Through dispatchers
who contact the criminal parties,

04:32.730 --> 04:34.607
arrange payments and assign interpreters.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.735
The dispatch has all the information.
The interpreters know nothing.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.530
Reddington's lost contact
with his dispatch.

04:41.197 --> 04:42.824
-What's our in?
-His interpreter.

04:42.907 --> 04:45.535
Wellstone relies on
its interpreters for referrals.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.161
It's how they recruit translators.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.664
Reddington's interpreter
will refer someone we pick?

04:49.747 --> 04:51.791
And that person
gets brought in and vetted,

04:51.874 --> 04:54.335
giving him a window to access the system

04:54.419 --> 04:56.754
and get the name
of the interpreter Keen used.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.632
Maybe the name of who
she was negotiating with, and for what.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.010
[Cooper] Normally, I'd reach out
to Language Analysis.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.971
What our interpreter learns
may compromise Keen.

05:05.054 --> 05:07.056
So I want to keep this in-house.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.517
-I only speak English.
-I speak Korean.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.811
-Does sign language count?
-Definitely not.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.271
Then I'm down to six.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.440
You speak six languages?

05:15.523 --> 05:18.067
Not including Latin,
which I doubt would come in handy

05:18.151 --> 05:20.528
unless the criminal
I interpreted for was the Pope.

05:20.611 --> 05:23.531
-Imagine that confessional.
-[Cooper] Park, reach out to Reddington.

05:23.614 --> 05:26.617
Tell him Aram's going in
and to arrange a meeting with his contact.

05:26.701 --> 05:29.162
Ressler, start laying
the groundwork for a cover story.

05:32.457 --> 05:36.127
As if I'm not already asking you
to do too much, try and open this drive.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.797
-Okay. Is this about a case?
-Not sure.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.050
Which is why I need you
to keep this between us.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.260
Nobody knows, especially Reddington.

05:47.346 --> 05:49.515
[knocking on door]

05:51.726 --> 05:54.228
-Paula! Hi!
-Steven!

05:54.312 --> 05:56.230
Got your message. Is everything all right?

05:56.314 --> 05:59.609
Oh, thanks for coming. Hello, Bill.

05:59.692 --> 06:03.988
Oh, the girls and I were
just tasting the cakes. Come in.

06:05.823 --> 06:10.119
Oh, would either of you
like a slice of cake?

06:10.203 --> 06:11.287
Um...

06:11.370 --> 06:14.874
Lemon, carrot and pink champagne?

06:14.957 --> 06:16.751
No, thank you. Maybe later.

06:16.834 --> 06:18.961
What are we celebrating, Paula?

06:21.255 --> 06:23.633
Maybe you boys should sit down.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.719
Is Glen here?

06:29.263 --> 06:32.600
Glen... transitioned.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.853
I don't know what that means.

06:38.022 --> 06:39.315
He died.

06:39.398 --> 06:41.901
What? What do you mean?

06:41.984 --> 06:43.444
From West Nile.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.363
[stammers] Oh, come on. [laughs]

06:46.197 --> 06:50.493
Come on. If this is one of Glen's
dreadful practical jokes--

06:50.576 --> 06:52.537
I would have gotten in touch sooner,

06:52.620 --> 06:57.667
but I have been so busy
with the planning and the party.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.628
He didn't want
no regular funeral, you know.

07:00.711 --> 07:06.217
Jelly Bean wanted his friends
to send him off with a real shindig.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.970
A potluck with dancing.

07:09.053 --> 07:12.598
And Huey, of course.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.559
West Nile?

07:14.642 --> 07:16.477
Paula, I am so sorry.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.229
Thank you, Bill.

07:18.312 --> 07:22.316
-When did this happen?
-A bit over two weeks ago.

07:22.400 --> 07:26.696
I know. I should have called,
but you slipped my mind.

07:27.321 --> 07:30.116
And then Trudy and I were going through

07:30.199 --> 07:34.829
some of their dirty letters
and we found this.

07:34.912 --> 07:36.914
[somber music playing]

07:38.249 --> 07:41.836
I was halfway inclined to open it,

07:41.919 --> 07:46.257
but you were his friend,
and I want to respect his wishes.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.259
He didn't send me no letter.

07:48.342 --> 07:52.221
Hey, what do you think about Luke
bringing his chicken tater bake?

07:52.305 --> 07:55.349
I think it could be real popular.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.560
I can't believe this is happening.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.729
Boys, I gotta go.

07:59.812 --> 08:03.357
There is too much to do
before Huey gets here.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.693
But do come to the party.

08:05.776 --> 08:10.698
Jelly would want you there,
tomorrow at 7 at the DMV.

08:12.033 --> 08:16.621
And don't forget to bring
a covered dish and your own tableware.

08:19.081 --> 08:20.208
What the hell?

08:24.295 --> 08:26.297
[dramatic music playing]

08:36.182 --> 08:39.352
-She was lucky to get out.
-Jenna. Hey.

08:39.435 --> 08:41.479
I came as soon as I got your text.

08:41.562 --> 08:44.357
-What happened?
-Fire in the kitchen.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.484
The smoke alarm didn't work.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.028
The doctors are prepping for surgery.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.572
But she's gonna be okay?

08:51.656 --> 08:52.490
They--

08:54.450 --> 08:55.409
They don't know.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.329
Hey. Talk to me.

08:59.455 --> 09:00.790
What's going on?

09:04.544 --> 09:06.587
Last year, we fell behind
at the restaurant.

09:06.671 --> 09:10.216
The banks wouldn't touch us.
So Melissa went to a local guy for help.

09:11.759 --> 09:15.304
-You borrowed from a loan shark?
-It did help for a while.

09:15.388 --> 09:20.768
But this month... It's the fourth payment
we missed in six months.

09:20.851 --> 09:23.729
This is the guy who came yesterday.
He did this to Melissa.

09:23.813 --> 09:27.108
I knew it was dangerous not to pay,
but I didn't think they'd do this.

09:27.775 --> 09:28.943
What's his name?

09:29.026 --> 09:30.903
He works with other people.

09:31.779 --> 09:34.198
-They'll come for us.
-That won't happen.

09:34.782 --> 09:35.741
I promise.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.286
Let me take care of this.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.166
She was living there.
Melissa, the daughter.

09:44.250 --> 09:48.879
-You gonna arrest me? For what?
-Loan-sharking, arson, attempted murder.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.299
I don't know where you got
your information from,

09:51.382 --> 09:54.885
but nobody would be stupid enough
to point the finger at me.

09:54.969 --> 09:57.763
Is that a threat?
Did you threaten my witness?

09:57.847 --> 09:58.681
Take it easy.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.975
-That's sure as hell how it sounded.
-[dialing]

10:01.058 --> 10:04.979
Honestly, the gall!
After all I've already done for him?

10:05.062 --> 10:07.773
All the jobs, the attention paid.

10:07.857 --> 10:12.695
All the time spent suffering his antics.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.615
All the money--
That ridiculous sports car.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.450
He was a civil servant.

10:17.533 --> 10:20.328
How could he explain all that stuff?
The money and all.

10:20.411 --> 10:21.746
I understand that.

10:21.829 --> 10:28.586
But why is it somehow my job to help
explain away the fortune I paid him?

10:28.669 --> 10:31.339
-He had to say something.
-Something, yes.

10:31.422 --> 10:36.927
But the man told everyone he knew
that he was Huey Lewis' muse.

10:37.011 --> 10:40.056
How, in any stretch of the imagination,

10:40.139 --> 10:44.518
does that explain
his crazy, extravagant lifestyle?

10:44.602 --> 10:47.438
What, Huey Lewis
bought him a red Mercedes?

10:47.521 --> 10:49.732
Does Huey Lewis even have a muse?

10:49.815 --> 10:53.069
Did Glen really tell his mother
Huey would attend?

10:54.695 --> 10:58.574
"This friendship with Huey
has always accounted for everything.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.868
My travels to Europe and Bangkok,

11:00.951 --> 11:04.830
all the cash, the cars,
everything in Vegas."

11:04.914 --> 11:05.748
I can't even.

11:06.749 --> 11:10.086
"Even the absence of any other
long-term relationship

11:10.169 --> 11:11.545
over the last 30 years,

11:11.629 --> 11:15.674
Huey is, in a word, the reason."
Two words.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.677
"Which is why his failure
to attend my memorial

11:18.761 --> 11:21.389
would be seen as a snub so great

11:21.472 --> 11:25.684
that I'm afraid it may send Mother
into a heartbroken tailspin

11:25.768 --> 11:27.978
which she may never recover from."

11:28.062 --> 11:31.065
-I mean--
-Mm. Talk about the power of love.

11:31.732 --> 11:33.275
How is this possible?

11:33.984 --> 11:40.950
It's as if he's reaching up from the grave
to torment and abuse me one last time.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.160
Raymond, Glen needs you.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.495
To do what?

11:44.578 --> 11:49.291
To bird-dog some pop star to inform him
that his most beloved songs

11:49.375 --> 11:53.712
were inspired by his bromance
with a clerk from the DMV?

11:53.796 --> 11:56.966
He needs you to convince Huey
to come to his memorial.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.634
Well, I'm not doing it.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.469
It's his dying wish.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.721
No. It's one of his dying wishes.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.557
-What's the other?
-Forget it.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.683
What does it say?

12:05.766 --> 12:07.768
[dramatic music playing]

12:09.770 --> 12:13.566
Ah. "Mother wants to place
my remains on her mantle.

12:13.649 --> 12:17.445
I don't like the idea of spending
my days looking down on Mother,

12:17.528 --> 12:21.574
so I want you to abscond
with my ashes and spread them."

12:21.657 --> 12:22.700
Spread them where?

12:25.286 --> 12:28.414
"I want to spend eternity
at the glorious feet

12:28.497 --> 12:31.876
of that grand dame,
the Statue of Liberty."

12:31.959 --> 12:34.712
I don't think it's legal
to spread ashes on Liberty Island.

12:34.795 --> 12:36.714
It doesn't matter
because I'm not doing it.

12:36.797 --> 12:39.550
I'm not lying to Paula
or spreading his ashes.

12:39.633 --> 12:41.427
-[cell phone buzzing]
-And I'm certainly not

12:41.510 --> 12:44.054
hunting down Huey Lewis

12:44.138 --> 12:48.684
or begging him to come
to Glen's potluck memorial.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.519
Jesus.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.274
-What is it?
-It's Glen's mom.

12:55.900 --> 12:59.862
She's asking if you can
bake a tray of scotcheroos.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.156
-They're short on desserts.
-Okay.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.995
Raymond, you know we have to do this.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.915
-For Glen.
-[sighs]

13:10.998 --> 13:13.000
[somber music playing]

13:14.710 --> 13:17.421
See if you can find Mr. Lewis' address.

13:18.589 --> 13:22.760
But I'm not breaking into the
Statue of Liberty to spread Glen's ashes.

13:23.802 --> 13:27.515
Stealing from Wellstone
is a terrible idea.

13:27.598 --> 13:31.268
But Reddington's made it clear
I have to get you inside the company.

13:31.352 --> 13:37.733
So let me be blunt. I'm not your friend.
I think that this is a suicide mission.

13:37.816 --> 13:42.571
And the only reason I'm helping you
is so that we don't both end up dead.

13:42.655 --> 13:46.242
Okay, let me try and say this
back to you. I take the pill.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.576
I black out.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.037
Then I wake up in the custody
of people I don't know,

13:50.120 --> 13:55.709
for a test I might pass, in the hopes
I get the job instead of getting killed?

13:55.793 --> 13:59.088
-I told you it's a bad idea.
-If I could just get to--

13:59.171 --> 14:02.883
-It won't work.
-All I need is one client's translator.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.177
-They have to have logs--
-You're not listening.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.680
These people run a criminal enterprise.

14:07.763 --> 14:09.557
They traffic in secrets.

14:09.640 --> 14:13.352
To protect those secrets,
they won't hesitate to kill you, or me,

14:13.435 --> 14:15.771
or anyone they think is a liability.

14:15.854 --> 14:17.856
[dramatic music playing]

14:27.741 --> 14:29.034
It's your funeral.

[dramatic music playing]

14:48.929 --> 14:49.930
[Aram grunts]

14:59.064 --> 15:02.151
Welcome back, Mr. Stone.
Did you have a nice rest?

15:02.234 --> 15:05.321
I, uh... don't remember getting here.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.114
My name is Miss Jessica.

15:07.197 --> 15:09.742
I'm here to discuss
the matrix of tests we'll administer

15:09.825 --> 15:13.495
-to see if you're a Wellstone candidate.
-"Matrix of tests"?

15:14.204 --> 15:16.582
-What tests?
-I'm so glad you asked.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.752
<i>We'll begin with</i>
<i>a polygraph-augmented consultation.</i>

15:19.835 --> 15:22.630
<i>Baseline questions. Work profile.</i>
<i>Personal history.</i>

15:22.713 --> 15:24.798
<i>Relevant experience</i>
<i>and potential conflicts.</i>

15:24.882 --> 15:28.510
<i>We'll follow with an aptitude test</i>
<i>and behavioral inquiry.</i>

15:28.594 --> 15:31.305
<i>We'll gauge the strength</i>
<i>of your language of expertise.</i>

15:31.388 --> 15:33.474
<i>Dialects, prose,</i>
<i>vocabulary and expression.</i>

15:33.557 --> 15:35.559
[speaking Urdu]

15:38.103 --> 15:40.105
<i>We'll audit that with some mock sessions.</i>

15:40.189 --> 15:42.483
<i>Scripted scenarios</i>
<i>based on actual encounters</i>

15:42.566 --> 15:44.485
<i>to test neutrality,</i>
<i>composure and patience.</i>

15:44.568 --> 15:45.986
[Aram speaking German]

15:48.864 --> 15:51.075
Before all that, I do want to stress,

15:51.158 --> 15:54.078
our primary objective
at Wellstone is privacy.

15:54.161 --> 15:58.666
Without discretion, we can't protect
our clients, ourselves or you.

15:58.749 --> 16:02.628
So, Mr. Stone, can you be discreet?

16:02.711 --> 16:05.047
[in English] Yes. I'm Mr. Discreet.

16:06.882 --> 16:08.008
[knocking on door]

16:11.845 --> 16:15.349
-You wanted to see me?
-The arrest that you made earlier.

16:15.432 --> 16:17.601
Uh, Mason Dieterle.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.688
He burned down my friend's restaurant.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.984
I just got off the phone
with the AUSA reviewing the case.

16:26.193 --> 16:28.821
He told me your friend
passed away from her injuries.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.197
I'm sorry.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.282
[emotional music playing]

16:43.794 --> 16:46.672
He also told me
that he declined to file charges

16:46.755 --> 16:48.966
for either arson or attempted murder.

16:49.717 --> 16:53.929
What? Why? He burned down
that diner. This was arson.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.515
AUSA said he didn't have
any evidence to prove that.

16:56.598 --> 17:00.227
Can you prove that Dieterle
was responsible for that fire?

17:00.310 --> 17:03.480
Do you have a witness? A print
on a can of gasoline or accelerant?

17:03.564 --> 17:06.400
-No, I just thought that--
-That's the problem.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.069
You didn't think. You reacted.

17:10.446 --> 17:13.032
Dieterle was arraigned
on a loan-sharking charge

17:13.115 --> 17:14.491
and made bail 20 minutes ago.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.577
I'm concerned, Alina.

17:16.660 --> 17:18.746
You have a history
of acting on your anger,

17:18.829 --> 17:21.457
at times letting your emotions
get the better of you.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.750
Now your friend is dead,

17:22.833 --> 17:26.045
and the man that you think is responsible
is back on the street.

17:26.128 --> 17:29.590
Promise me you will not
do anything about that.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.051
Do I have your word?

17:34.470 --> 17:36.346
Yes. You do.

17:37.848 --> 17:40.642
Mr. Lewis, I just want
to say it's a privilege

17:40.726 --> 17:43.312
and a great pleasure to meet you.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.898
I appreciate that. Thank you very much.

17:45.981 --> 17:47.566
Thank you for agreeing to see me.

17:47.649 --> 17:51.278
I take it you're something
of a culinary man. I love to cook.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.782
-Uh, to be honest, Mr. Homan--
-Steve, please.

17:54.865 --> 17:59.036
Okay. To be honest, Steve, I only agreed
because my manager insisted.

17:59.119 --> 18:01.955
Oh, I did Jerry a favor once.

18:02.039 --> 18:04.416
Well, a friend of Jerry's.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.085
Must have been quite a favor.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.294
[laughing]

18:07.377 --> 18:10.714
-Can I get you something? Coffee?
-No, no, no. Thank you.

18:10.798 --> 18:15.219
I don't want to take up any more
of your time than necessary.

18:15.302 --> 18:17.429
-Mm-hm.
-I'm here

18:17.513 --> 18:21.975
because a dear friend
of mine passed away recently.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.978
-Pillar of his community.
-Mm-hm.

18:25.062 --> 18:29.024
Loved his mother. Paula.
Wonderful, wonderful woman.

18:29.441 --> 18:30.734
And he--

18:31.235 --> 18:36.573
Well, he absolutely cherished your music.

18:36.657 --> 18:39.993
-He knew every word of every song.
-Oh.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.161
Really.

18:41.245 --> 18:45.749
Now, I realize it's a bit of a long shot,

18:45.833 --> 18:50.129
but I was wondering if you might consider,
for a price, of course,

18:50.212 --> 18:54.383
might consider
attending his memorial service...

18:55.467 --> 18:57.094
at the Rockville, Maryland DMV.

18:57.177 --> 18:59.471
It's tonight, 7 p.m.

19:00.639 --> 19:01.557
The DMV?

19:01.640 --> 19:04.393
Yes. Glen was regional manager.

19:05.519 --> 19:09.481
Did Jerry know that this is
what you wanted to ask me?

19:09.565 --> 19:13.235
As I said, uh,
I sort of did him a favor once.

19:13.318 --> 19:16.613
To play the funeral
of some guy at the DMV?

19:16.697 --> 19:17.781
Regional manager.

19:17.865 --> 19:21.535
You do know that Quincy Jones
asked me to sing on "We Are the World."

19:21.618 --> 19:24.246
A stirring performance.

19:24.329 --> 19:27.708
And a great honor and tribute.

19:28.292 --> 19:31.461
Love of your fellow man and all that.

19:32.838 --> 19:39.011
Not entirely unlike the love a son
might have for his mother.

19:39.595 --> 19:43.807
A desire to make her proud,
to impress her.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.976
-Mm-hm.
-Things were said through the years.

19:46.935 --> 19:48.645
I think he--

19:49.771 --> 19:54.193
He told his mother he inspired you
to record "Workin' for a Livin'"

19:54.276 --> 19:57.905
after a game of beer pong
in the back of a bar in Teaneck.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.198
She believed him?

19:59.281 --> 20:01.241
Believed him? Oh, no. No.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.284
[stammering]

20:02.367 --> 20:05.454
To her, it would make perfect sense

20:05.537 --> 20:10.918
that her son was singularly responsible
for your legendary song.

20:11.001 --> 20:15.756
And that you, who benefitted
from her son's inspiration,

20:15.839 --> 20:18.884
would want more than anything to show up

20:18.967 --> 20:22.304
at his memorial service
to pay your respects.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.389
Okay. [laughing]

20:24.473 --> 20:28.018
Is this a joke?
Did Ralphie put you up to this?

20:28.101 --> 20:33.273
I am so sorry. I mean it,
you can name your price.

20:33.357 --> 20:37.277
-To play the Rockville DMV?
-No, you don't have to play.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.280
Just show up. Say a few words.

20:40.364 --> 20:45.619
Plus, if you do, I'll owe you a favor.
I'm a good person to have in your debt.

20:45.702 --> 20:48.080
So you'll do whatever I ask?

20:48.747 --> 20:50.874
-Absolutely.
-Great.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.543
I'm gonna ask you to leave.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.629
I got an interview across town in an hour.

20:55.712 --> 20:58.632
I gotta eat, get ready.
I don't want to be late.

20:58.715 --> 21:00.467
Sorry. You have to go.

21:06.348 --> 21:10.102
Thank you, Mr. Stone.
Miss Jessica will be with you momentarily.

21:10.185 --> 21:11.353
Okay.

21:15.315 --> 21:17.317
[suspenseful music playing]

21:42.718 --> 21:43.635
Yes.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.690
This is certainly unexpected.

21:56.773 --> 21:58.942
That is what I thought.

22:01.028 --> 22:04.448
-What happened to being discreet?
-Excuse me?

22:04.531 --> 22:07.576
I was waiting for you
when I spilled my soda.

22:08.368 --> 22:11.038
Then I came to your desk for a tissue,

22:11.121 --> 22:15.042
when I found this on your computer.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.253
Is this how this works?

22:19.046 --> 22:21.965
-I don't follow.
-All of you people are putting me

22:22.049 --> 22:26.011
through a matrix of tests
to find out if you can trust me,

22:26.094 --> 22:32.184
and yet you carelessly leave
this client profile open on your laptop?

22:32.267 --> 22:35.312
What if I were an FBI agent, undercover,

22:35.395 --> 22:38.774
and saw the profile of this guy, this...

22:39.775 --> 22:41.401
Alexander Frayne.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.489
This is sloppy. I don't like it.

22:45.572 --> 22:47.240
-My assistant--
-It doesn't matter.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.284
This is lazy, unprofessional.

22:49.367 --> 22:53.246
I'm sorry that this has shaken
your confidence in us, Mr. Stone.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.082
I do hope you'll reconsider.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.210
-Reconsider?
-The job.

22:58.293 --> 23:00.545
You passed with flying colors.

23:00.629 --> 23:03.799

to welcome you to Wellstone.

-Who are you?

-Why are you helping me?
-Quid pro quo, Alexander.

24:07.946 --> 24:11.825
You interpreted a meeting between
this woman and another party.

24:11.908 --> 24:14.911
I need to know who she met
and what they talked about.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.371
I can't help you.

24:18.248 --> 24:19.708

24:20.250 --> 24:22.711
No, no. Wait. Um...

24:22.794 --> 24:25.630
I'm not saying I won't help.
I'm saying I can't.

24:25.714 --> 24:29.509
-I don't know who he was.
-You facilitated their conversation.

24:29.593 --> 24:32.554
He was Bosnian.
But they don't give out names.

24:33.305 --> 24:37.058
She paid 700 grand for a manila envelope.
I never saw what was inside.

24:37.142 --> 24:38.476
Who has the names?

24:39.686 --> 24:42.647
The head of the company, I guess.
I don't even know who that is.

24:42.731 --> 24:45.901
But if you send
the right message, he'll get it.

24:46.610 --> 24:50.780

Say you have a situation.
