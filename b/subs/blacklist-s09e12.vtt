WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:04.212
You know, the first stock exchange
started in Belgium,

00:04.295 --> 00:05.505
1531,

00:05.588 --> 00:07.841
and for the next five centuries,

00:07.924 --> 00:13.555
this flow of capital transformed the world
more than politics, religion, war.

00:14.055 --> 00:15.807
And like all markets,

00:16.307 --> 00:18.268
ours depends on rules.

00:18.351 --> 00:21.896
The honest reporting of profit and loss.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.648
You failed to do that. You...

00:24.357 --> 00:26.693
You lied on your disclosure forms.

00:27.402 --> 00:30.321
You raised $78 million

00:30.405 --> 00:35.285
to build a tunnel under the border
that you never intended to build.

00:35.368 --> 00:39.330
Five miles of road and rail,
flatbeds, pallets, people.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.666
With entrances and exits

00:41.750 --> 00:44.836
located at warehouses that you control.

00:44.919 --> 00:45.962
Instead,

00:46.045 --> 00:49.924
you invested the money
in Miami real estate.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.470
Now, on Wall Street,
this kind of Ponzi scheme

00:53.553 --> 00:57.015
would get you a slap on the wrist
and a Central Park co-op.

00:57.098 --> 01:01.895
Your investors, however, the often
unscrupulous people you ripped off--

01:01.978 --> 01:05.231
I think you see where I'm going with this.
It's nowhere good.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.108
They're very emotional people.

01:07.192 --> 01:11.196
And right now, their emotions
are tending towards usury and murder.

01:11.279 --> 01:12.655
Luckily for you,

01:12.739 --> 01:15.158
we have rules
that we've all agreed to follow.

01:15.241 --> 01:16.367
To wit--

01:16.951 --> 01:20.789
I have no idea what "to wit" means.
I just love the way it sounds.

01:20.872 --> 01:22.290
Let's see.

01:22.373 --> 01:25.627
Section 42, subparagraph C.

01:25.710 --> 01:26.669
Punishments.

01:26.753 --> 01:27.754
"To wit.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.841
Punishments are
for the Chairman to decide."

01:31.925 --> 01:34.594
Now, your investors want you dead.

01:34.677 --> 01:37.138
I'm thinking more walking dead.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.933
Living, breathing examples of what happens

01:40.016 --> 01:41.726
when you break our rules.

01:41.810 --> 01:44.729
These are the consent forms
you each signed,

01:44.813 --> 01:48.024
consenting to abide by my decision.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.776
And my decision is this.

01:49.859 --> 01:52.862
Repayment in full, plus 20%...

01:53.905 --> 01:54.781
and fingers.

01:54.864 --> 01:55.865
Two from you.

01:55.949 --> 01:56.950
Two from you.

01:57.033 --> 01:58.201
Three from you.

01:58.284 --> 02:01.371
From the hand you used
to sign your consent form.

02:01.454 --> 02:02.831
You see, this is a blood oath.

02:02.914 --> 02:03.748
You broke it.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.459
So I get a piece
of what you broke it with.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.503
Beth, you're the ringleader.

02:09.003 --> 02:09.879
Lead the ring.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.923
No, no. Please don't do this.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.466
-[sobbing]
-Too late for that.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.600
Uh, Joel, that's three from Beth.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.687
Just work backwards from the pinkie.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.897
Oh, and, uh, Beth?

02:27.981 --> 02:30.316
Feel free to tell anybody who asks.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.776
If they're gonna cheat,

02:31.860 --> 02:33.528
cheat the stock market,

02:33.611 --> 02:35.113
not the night market.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.824
[Beth sobbing]

02:38.449 --> 02:39.534
[screaming]

02:47.750 --> 02:50.253
You know, MPD has nothing
on the bartender.

02:50.336 --> 02:52.547
After a month.
It's like it never happened.

02:52.630 --> 02:54.173
Well, he was hit by a pro.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.593
Finding a clue trail's gonna take time.

02:57.093 --> 02:58.428
I don't have time.

02:58.511 --> 03:01.306
What I have is some voicebox
who keeps calling to remind me

03:01.389 --> 03:02.599
he's got a gun to my head.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.310
Next time he calls,
you'll be able to record his voice.

03:05.393 --> 03:09.105
We'll see if we can't unscramble
the voicebox and get an ID.

03:09.188 --> 03:10.732
What the hell are you looking for?

03:10.815 --> 03:12.108
Mimi's missing.

03:12.191 --> 03:13.693
A stuffed bunny. Yea big.

03:13.776 --> 03:14.736
Charred feet.

03:15.236 --> 03:17.447
A bunny with charred feet?

03:17.530 --> 03:19.073
It's Agnes' transitional object.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.409
At her age, isn't that a smartphone?

03:21.492 --> 03:22.702
It belonged to her mother.

03:22.785 --> 03:25.163
It played a key role in the breakup
of the Soviet Union.

03:25.246 --> 03:26.080
The bunny did?

03:26.831 --> 03:30.251
Thank you, by the way, for the phone
and for reviewing the case file again.

03:30.335 --> 03:31.878
I've reviewed it three times.

03:31.961 --> 03:34.255
Then thanks for reviewing it a fourth.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.132
We have to find out what happened.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.676
If the cops can't help,
we have to help ourselves.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.844
[phone ringing]

03:39.928 --> 03:40.929
Nick's Pizza.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.473
Maybe they have the bunny.

03:47.101 --> 03:48.061
[door opens]

03:48.645 --> 03:49.520
Harold.

03:50.146 --> 03:50.980
Please.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.485
-Reading your future?
-[Raymond chuckles]

03:56.361 --> 03:57.362
I don't know.

03:58.780 --> 03:59.906
Mierce.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.866
For me, it's just...

04:02.659 --> 04:03.743
calming.

04:04.827 --> 04:06.287
Is this about Elizabeth?

04:07.038 --> 04:09.457
Her body needs to be exhumed, Harold.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.542
Aram told me about the tracker.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.628
That whomever wanted her dead

04:13.711 --> 04:15.755
put it in her, not on her.

04:15.838 --> 04:18.091
Yet you posted guards at her grave.

04:18.174 --> 04:19.550
She's resting in peace.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.636
I intend on keeping it that way.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.140
Much of my world

04:26.224 --> 04:30.311
exists right alongside yours.

04:30.395 --> 04:35.692
People and organizations in our two worlds
have the same needs.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.861
Security, medical care, air travel,

04:38.945 --> 04:42.573
corporate infrastructure,
financial services.

04:42.657 --> 04:45.243
Hence the night market,

04:45.326 --> 04:47.370
a stock market for criminals.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.956
The Sinaloa Cartel issues stocks?

04:50.039 --> 04:52.667
Cartels. Gangs. Crime syndicates.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.586
The yakuza is no different than Google.

04:55.670 --> 05:00.925
They both issue stock to raise money
to pay for R&amp;D, capital expenses

05:01.009 --> 05:03.177
to expand their operations.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.262
Are you in the market?

05:04.345 --> 05:09.934
Of course. Capital markets are the key
to explosive growth in your world.

05:10.018 --> 05:14.063
The night market is no different in mine.
I'd be a fool not to take advantage of it.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.648
But you want us to bring it down.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.276
The man in charge
is known as the Chairman.

05:18.359 --> 05:21.863
I don't know his real name
or where exactly to find him.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.531
He moves around a lot.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.158
What I do know

05:25.241 --> 05:27.994
is that he's a one-man SEC.

05:28.077 --> 05:30.371
Judge, jury, and executioner.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.415
These unfortunates

05:32.498 --> 05:35.543
misled their investors
in advance of an IPO.

05:35.626 --> 05:36.961
The Chairman did this?

05:37.045 --> 05:38.212
To send a message.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.255
Quite literally.

05:39.338 --> 05:43.676
They take a photo
and disseminate it to the community.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.263
You're wrong about Elizabeth.

05:47.346 --> 05:48.723
She's not resting.

05:48.806 --> 05:50.183
Nor in peace.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.225
She's dead.

05:51.934 --> 05:55.521
She can't be disturbed
because she doesn't exist.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.523
We exist.

05:57.607 --> 05:58.733
We hurt.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.777
We are in pain.

06:01.277 --> 06:02.862
And we need answers.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.325
[Cooper] What you're looking at is
a black market stock market.

06:07.408 --> 06:09.786
The night market is made up
of hundreds of companies

06:09.869 --> 06:11.245
raising billions in capital.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.623
But what companies?
What do the initials stand for?

06:13.706 --> 06:16.667
According to Reddington, they're a code
he doesn't have the key to.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.962
If this is an online trading platform,
why don't we just pull the plug?

06:20.046 --> 06:23.341
Because the night market is hosted
on a decentralized blockchain network,

06:23.424 --> 06:26.636
meaning it runs across 10,000 nodes
all over the world.

06:26.719 --> 06:31.307
Even if we could shut one down,
the other 9999 would keep humming.

06:31.390 --> 06:34.685
We'd basically have to disconnect
the entire Internet to stop it.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.647
The only company Reddington
could identify is this one.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.316
BKRC stands for Banda Korçë.

06:40.399 --> 06:41.275
Albanian.

06:41.359 --> 06:44.195
Specializing in extortion
and money laundering.

06:44.278 --> 06:45.905
Casinos are their drug of choice.

06:45.988 --> 06:47.990
A fact the Gaming Enforcement got wind of.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.827
They opened up an investigation
into Tremont Casinos,

06:50.910 --> 06:53.663
the legitimate company
the BKRC muscled in on,

06:53.746 --> 06:58.000
and as a result, Tremont's stock
on Wall Street went down 30%, and yet--

06:58.084 --> 07:01.129
On the night market, BKRC's up 25%.

07:01.212 --> 07:02.338
[Park] How's that possible?

07:02.421 --> 07:05.800
The investigation by Gaming Enforcement
should be bad for both companies.

07:05.883 --> 07:08.177
Markets price in information.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.555
If BKRC's stock is going up,

07:10.638 --> 07:13.474
that means the criminal market knows
something the legitimate one doesn't.

07:13.558 --> 07:16.185
Like what? They're gonna be able
to stop the investigation?

07:16.269 --> 07:19.522
The night market is run by a man
who does this to people who cross him.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.399
He's known as the Chairman.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.526
To bring down the market,
we need to get him.

07:23.609 --> 07:26.404
Maybe the way to do that
is to get to BKRC.

07:26.487 --> 07:30.074
Dembe, Park, go to Gaming Enforcement,
see what they know.

07:32.743 --> 07:35.788
Did Reddington say anything
about the guards posted at the cemetery?

07:35.872 --> 07:37.915
He did. He wasn't happy about it.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.126
His concern is our need for closure,

07:40.209 --> 07:42.587
not hers for peace and tranquility.

07:42.670 --> 07:43.963
His need or ours?

07:44.046 --> 07:46.507
If what you're asking is,
"Do the guards stay?"

07:46.591 --> 07:47.842
the answer is yes.

07:48.342 --> 07:49.677
All right. Thank you.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.929
Look, I want answers
as much as Reddington,

07:52.013 --> 07:55.141
but not at the expense
of disturbing Liz's remains.

07:57.310 --> 08:01.314
Tremont's stock is in a nose dive
because our investigation is rock solid.

08:01.397 --> 08:04.025
We know they're in business
with Banda Korçë.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.069
That Banda Korçë is run by Driton Abazi

08:07.153 --> 08:09.614
and that he's using Tremont's casinos
to launder money.

08:09.697 --> 08:12.742
What's your timeline?
When do you plan on arresting Abazi?

08:12.825 --> 08:13.659
He's smart.

08:13.743 --> 08:16.454
Insulated. But we've finally got
someone on the inside.

08:16.537 --> 08:18.372
Your inside source. What's his name?

08:18.456 --> 08:21.250
If you approach him, he might run scared.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.211
Everything we've worked on could be lost.

08:23.294 --> 08:24.587
We wanna make sure he's okay.

08:24.670 --> 08:27.006
Why wouldn't he be?
What aren't you telling us?

08:27.089 --> 08:29.383
It's conventional wisdom
in the criminal world

08:29.467 --> 08:31.844
that your investigation's going nowhere.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.847
Since it rests on this source,
it stands to reason

08:34.931 --> 08:36.474
that his life may be in danger.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.145
It's not a "he."

08:41.771 --> 08:42.813
It's a "she."

08:43.606 --> 08:45.525
And we have no case without her.

08:51.906 --> 08:53.783
Thanks for the Dom, baby.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.452
Lorik gave it to me
but he didn't tell me what it was for.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.412
<i>It's a going-away present.</i>

08:58.496 --> 09:00.540
I like the sound of that.
Where are we going?

09:00.623 --> 09:01.874
<i>A toast.</i>

09:01.958 --> 09:03.417
<i>To stupidity.</i>

09:04.168 --> 09:05.086
That's a dumb toast.

09:05.169 --> 09:07.713
<i>Well, we are dumb people.</i>

09:07.797 --> 09:10.341
<i>I'm stupid for thinking that you loved me,</i>

09:10.424 --> 09:14.220
<i>and you're stupid for thinking</i>
<i>I wouldn't find out what you did.</i>

09:14.303 --> 09:15.805
What are you talking about?

09:15.888 --> 09:18.015
<i>Don't talk. Drink.</i>

09:18.099 --> 09:22.603
<i>If you have enough before he gets there,</i>
<i>it might not hurt as much.</i>

09:22.687 --> 09:24.480
If this is a joke, it's not funny.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.898
<i>It's not a joke.</i>

09:25.982 --> 09:27.775
<i>It's a going-away present.</i>

09:27.858 --> 09:31.946
-I don't understand. Where are we going?
<i>-We're not going anywhere.</i>

09:32.029 --> 09:35.116
<i>You are. To a very painful place.</i>

09:35.199 --> 09:36.784
<i>The champagne may numb it.</i>

09:36.867 --> 09:38.869
<i>That's it. My present.</i>

09:38.953 --> 09:40.454
<i>To numb the pain.</i>

09:40.538 --> 09:42.206
It's the classic love story.

09:42.290 --> 09:45.001
Boy meets girl, girl betrays boy,

09:45.084 --> 09:47.587
boy has psychopath dismember girl.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.880
It's so clichéd, it's almost boring.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.507
I didn't betray anybody.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.634
That would be hard to prove.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.637
Gaming Enforcement
encrypts all of its files.

09:56.721 --> 10:00.474
Unfortunately, someone forgot
to firewall the copy machine.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.730
You don't believe him, right?

10:05.813 --> 10:07.648
Look, please, I didn't--

10:09.317 --> 10:11.902
[Chairman] You know,
I love reading quarterly reports.

10:11.986 --> 10:14.572
Examining financial disclosures.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.032
Regulating the market.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.368
The part of my job I detest
is enforcement.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.287
Lately, it seems like all I do.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.711
Two years.

10:28.794 --> 10:31.714
We've spent two years
trying to turn Tsiona Stern.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.924
And then we show up and she disappears.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.426
[Laren] <i>Disappears? She's dead.</i>

10:35.509 --> 10:39.513
She didn't miss a check-in, not one,
until you started asking around.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.183
Ms. Stern put her life at risk
to help expose Banda Korçë.

10:42.266 --> 10:43.851
That was very brave.

10:43.934 --> 10:46.562
<i>And we can honor that bravery</i>
<i>by carrying on with her work.</i>

10:46.646 --> 10:48.189
<i>You by going back to your office,</i>

10:48.272 --> 10:51.025
reviewing your files
and seeing where the case stands.

10:51.108 --> 10:53.319
We, by looking into her murder.

10:53.402 --> 10:55.321
We can't do that without names.

10:55.404 --> 10:58.282
<i>Family. Friends. Who was closest to her?</i>

10:58.783 --> 11:00.242
She had a sister.

11:00.743 --> 11:03.746
Ressler, get her name and number.
Take Dembe. See what she knows.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.168
Find anything on the bartender?

11:09.251 --> 11:11.587
Maybe yes, maybe no.

11:11.671 --> 11:15.007
The bartender was close
with a woman he worked with.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.217
Did the police talk with her?

11:16.300 --> 11:18.761
They tried,
but she wouldn't return their calls.

11:18.844 --> 11:22.390
Cops got busy, had other leads,
she fell through the cracks.

11:22.473 --> 11:25.851
Turned out she didn't return their calls
because she disappeared.

11:25.935 --> 11:29.188
Left her apartment the day
after the murder. Hasn't been seen since.

11:29.271 --> 11:30.940
-Do you have a name?
-I do.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.735
That's all I have.
May be a lead, maybe not.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.154
Hey, uh, by the way,

11:37.238 --> 11:40.699
did you ever find the bunny
that solved the Cold War?

11:40.783 --> 11:42.660
Hell of a bedtime story.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.662
Mimi belonged to Agnes' mother.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.081
Holding onto it is...

11:47.832 --> 11:49.333
like holding on to her.

11:49.417 --> 11:53.546
And yeah, it's a hell of a story.
One I'm not sure I should tell Agnes.

11:53.629 --> 11:56.799
-Her mother's part in it was complicated.
-Agnes deserves the truth.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.551
Even the parts that are complicated.

11:58.634 --> 12:01.429
You think that extends
to how her mother died...

12:01.929 --> 12:04.390
which might be
the most complicated part of all?

12:04.473 --> 12:07.560
Well, of all the parts of the story
you have to tell,

12:07.643 --> 12:09.353
that's the most important one.

12:09.937 --> 12:12.148
Without it, she'll never get closure.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.150
Thanks, Lew.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.026
For the advice.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.111
And for this.

12:17.194 --> 12:19.697
Yeah. Hey, did voicebox ever reach out?

12:19.780 --> 12:21.657
Not yet. But it's been a few weeks,

12:21.740 --> 12:24.243
-so it's only a matter of time.
-All right.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.122
Hey.

12:28.205 --> 12:29.498
I'd like to meet.

12:30.082 --> 12:30.916
No.

12:31.625 --> 12:32.835
At the cemetery.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.047
I begged her not to cooperate
with the cops.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.717
I told her just to get out.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.552
But she was stuck on the guy.

12:42.052 --> 12:44.472
If she cared for Abazi,
why'd she inform on him?

12:44.555 --> 12:46.140
It was volatile,

12:46.223 --> 12:47.308
passionate.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.144
Spite. Anger. Jealousy.

12:50.227 --> 12:52.354
The trifecta of the scorned lover.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.731
So Abazi cheated on her.

12:53.814 --> 12:54.982
He's a thug.

12:55.065 --> 12:57.985
Hurting people,
skimming off casino profits.

12:58.068 --> 13:01.906
She might've gone against him anyway,
but Felicia sure helped.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.199
Felicia?

13:03.282 --> 13:04.241
Dawson.

13:04.950 --> 13:08.496
She's a dealer he moved
into one of his suites at the casino.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.122
Tsiona followed him there,

13:10.206 --> 13:12.333
expecting to catch him with Felicia.

13:12.416 --> 13:13.250
Which she did,

13:13.334 --> 13:17.171
as well as finding him
having some kind of business meeting.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.674
You wanna bug a suite at the casino?

13:20.758 --> 13:24.136
The informant's sister says that's
where Abazi conducted a lot of business.

13:24.220 --> 13:28.182
The suite's rented in the name
of his girlfriend. His other girlfriend.

13:28.265 --> 13:29.517
A Felicia Dawson.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.101
[Dembe] Former casino employee.

13:31.185 --> 13:34.021
-Divorced, 5-year-old daughter.
-Now consorting with criminals.

13:34.104 --> 13:36.899
Should be enough to pull a warrant,
hear what they talk about.

13:36.982 --> 13:39.568
Hopefully hear enough from Abazi
to get to the Chairman.

13:39.652 --> 13:43.364
Getting a warrant may not be
the problem. Installing the bug is.

13:43.447 --> 13:44.740
I do not envy the guy

13:44.823 --> 13:48.452
who has to slip in and out
of the love nest of an Albanian mobster.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.498
-Room service.
-Hands out.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.458
[Felicia] I'm not doing it.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.627
<i>Doing what?</i>
<i>I'm asking you to meet some people.</i>

13:56.710 --> 13:58.837
[Felicia] I know
what you're asking me to do,

13:58.921 --> 14:00.422
and the answer is no.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.341
<i>Call me back when you're alone.</i>

14:04.927 --> 14:06.262
What are you looking at?

14:06.345 --> 14:09.890
Oh. Uh, nothing.
I will just put things out.

14:10.766 --> 14:11.600
Very good.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.116
[sniffling nearby]

14:31.954 --> 14:33.080
Oh.

14:33.163 --> 14:34.164
Hello.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.458
I'm guessing the hot dog is for you.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.918
Wanna eat it down here?

14:38.794 --> 14:39.628
Okay.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.673
One hot dog coming up.

14:42.756 --> 14:44.675
There you go. Voila.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.677
What's wrong?

14:46.760 --> 14:47.845
Parents fighting?

14:47.928 --> 14:49.597
They're not my parents.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.806
He's not.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.308
What's that?

14:52.391 --> 14:54.018
I saw you put it there.

14:54.101 --> 14:56.270
That? Oh. Um...

14:57.187 --> 14:58.898
That's part of a magic trick.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.190
If it's done right,

15:00.274 --> 15:02.109
Mr. Abazi will disappear.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.944
People can't disappear.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.404
Not normally, no.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.114
But, uh, this--

15:07.197 --> 15:08.824
this is a very special trick.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.368
But for it to work, you can't tell anyone.

15:11.452 --> 15:12.745
Not even your mom.

15:13.579 --> 15:14.914
Think you can do that?

15:14.997 --> 15:17.416
But if he goes, will he ever come back?

15:17.499 --> 15:18.709
Of course not.

15:19.543 --> 15:20.628
It's magic.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.549
[Cooper] Agnes is doing well.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.134
At school,

15:27.801 --> 15:29.428
she's getting mostly A's.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.722
A B-plus in math.

15:32.389 --> 15:34.099
She doesn't really like math.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.060
Neither do I.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.355
She's got lots of friends.

15:40.648 --> 15:44.944
At the moment, her biggest concern
is that we've misplaced Mimi.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.153
I'm sure she'll turn up,

15:46.236 --> 15:49.657
but for now, the house
has been turned upside down.

15:53.827 --> 15:56.080
When my father died,

15:56.580 --> 15:59.041
I kept a little painting of his.

16:00.542 --> 16:04.338
He always wished he'd been a real painter.

16:04.421 --> 16:06.423
But at least there was the one.

16:07.007 --> 16:11.679
He took terrible care of it,
so it's faded and torn.

16:12.846 --> 16:15.057
But it reminded me of him, so I...

16:16.767 --> 16:18.227
kept it in the bathroom.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.230
Every morning,
he and I would have a little chat.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.568
Why do we do that,

16:26.652 --> 16:27.820
talk to the dead?

16:29.113 --> 16:31.407
They're gone. Why do we talk to them?

16:35.244 --> 16:36.620
But they're not gone.

16:37.746 --> 16:40.624
As long as we're here,
they're here with us.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.044
Where are the guards?

16:44.128 --> 16:45.295
I dismissed them.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.007
If Elizabeth is watching over us...

16:49.717 --> 16:51.885
I think she'd want Agnes
to know the truth.

16:51.969 --> 16:52.803
At least...

16:53.595 --> 16:55.848
as much of it as we can give her.

16:58.308 --> 16:59.143
Thank you.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.395
I'll get a court order.

17:02.479 --> 17:04.982
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it the right way.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.369
Hello, Elizabeth.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.713
[Cooper] Where did you find it?

17:27.796 --> 17:29.006
[Raymond] Under the seat.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.550
Agnes fell asleep
on the way back from the opera.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.802
-Must've dropped it.
-Been looking everywhere.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.888
You have no idea what a relief this is.

17:35.971 --> 17:37.097
Of course I do.

17:37.181 --> 17:39.308
Elizabeth couldn't sleep.

17:39.391 --> 17:40.559
Colicky.

17:40.642 --> 17:42.061
But more often than not,

17:42.144 --> 17:44.938
when she scrunched that bunny
against her cheek,

17:45.022 --> 17:46.190
she was...

17:46.982 --> 17:47.900
calm.

17:48.734 --> 17:49.568
Quiet.

17:49.651 --> 17:53.697
You should've taken her to the opera.
That'll put anyone to sleep.

18:02.831 --> 18:05.542
Harold, please instruct
the medical examiner

18:05.626 --> 18:09.129
to be as respectful as possible.

18:11.548 --> 18:14.676
Why? Because I'm terrified
for my daughter.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.096
Yes, names, dates.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.724
That's fine. Rogers Park, 3:00.

18:23.852 --> 18:26.230
The meeting's set with King and McVay.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.356
<i>You did good.</i>

18:27.439 --> 18:29.733
<i>Even I believed you betrayed me.</i>

18:29.817 --> 18:32.569
I heard Abazi and Felicia arguing.
This could be why.

18:32.653 --> 18:35.239
He's using her to set up King and McVay.

18:35.322 --> 18:36.657
[Abazi] <i>This is how it's gonna go.</i>

18:36.740 --> 18:38.826
<i>Lorik drives, get out,</i>

18:38.909 --> 18:40.369
<i>enter the park.</i>

18:40.452 --> 18:43.122
<i>When they approach,</i>
<i>you drop your sunglasses,</i>

18:43.205 --> 18:44.540
<i>bend down to pick them up.</i>

18:44.623 --> 18:46.250
<i>Lorik does the rest.</i>

18:46.333 --> 18:47.709
Meaning he kills them.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.461
<i>Meaning that whatever it is,</i>

18:49.545 --> 18:51.338
<i>you don't have to worry about it.</i>

18:51.421 --> 18:53.048
[Ressler] Dembe and I will go to the park.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.592
You let King and McVay know
they're walking into a trap.

18:57.761 --> 19:00.722
Does Abazi actually think killing
the two people investigating him

19:00.806 --> 19:02.099
will stop the investigation?

19:02.182 --> 19:04.184
He's not thinking. He's reacting.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.645
Like a cornered animal lashing out.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.565
[Lily] <i>Mommy!</i>

19:09.648 --> 19:11.650
[Felicia] <i>Mommy's gonna go run an errand.</i>

19:11.733 --> 19:15.112
Driton's coming over
to be with you while I'm gone, okay?

19:17.197 --> 19:18.490
<i>Don't worry, kid.</i>

19:18.574 --> 19:19.950
<i>We'll have a good time.</i>

19:23.829 --> 19:25.664
Please make him disappear.

19:25.747 --> 19:27.291
Please make him disappear.

19:27.374 --> 19:29.835
<i>Please make him disappear.</i>

19:31.795 --> 19:32.629
Sir, sir.

19:32.713 --> 19:33.964
About, uh, Driton Abazi--

19:34.047 --> 19:35.132
Not now, okay?

19:35.215 --> 19:37.926
-Is everything all right?
-I'm sure it will be. It's just--

19:38.677 --> 19:41.054
The exhumation. I ordered it.

19:42.639 --> 19:46.018
Pursuant to an order issued
by Superior Court Judge Victoria Shapiro,

19:46.101 --> 19:49.479
we are conducting an exhumation autopsy
on Elizabeth Keen.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.481
The purpose of the autopsy is to determine

19:51.565 --> 19:53.567
whether Agent Keen ingested
a tracking device

19:53.650 --> 19:55.861
which remains inside her post mortem.

19:56.695 --> 19:57.905
All right, then.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.823
Where are we on King and McVay?

19:59.907 --> 20:02.951
That was their supervisor.
They're not picking up his calls or mine.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.162
Not surprised. After what happened,

20:05.245 --> 20:07.664
they don't trust anybody, especially us.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.668
[Ressler] All right.
This could be the agents arriving.

20:21.678 --> 20:23.347
Here comes King and McVay.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.141
[Dembe] I'll keep eyes on the driver.

20:26.725 --> 20:27.851
Thanks for coming.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.062
We wanna start by saying
we will protect you.

20:30.145 --> 20:31.438
I wish you could.

20:31.521 --> 20:34.024
But you can't even protect yourselves.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.111
It's a hit.

20:41.657 --> 20:42.908
FBI, stand back!

20:42.991 --> 20:45.244
-You all right?
-[Dembe] Get away from the car.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.790
Donald Ressler, FBI.

20:49.873 --> 20:51.583
-You need to come with us.
-I can't.

20:51.667 --> 20:52.668
My daughter.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.044
We know about your daughter.

20:54.127 --> 20:56.964
-Is she all right?
-She will be if you come with us. Now.

21:00.509 --> 21:01.343
[Felicia] <i>It's done.</i>

21:01.426 --> 21:02.761
<i>But Lorik was shot.</i>

21:03.345 --> 21:07.182
I don't know. One of the agents,
I think, before they were killed.

21:08.850 --> 21:11.561
I don't know.
It all happened so fast, I just--

21:12.980 --> 21:14.147
Baby, I'm scared.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.776
I need you to come and get me.

21:17.859 --> 21:19.736
And I need you to bring Lily.

21:21.571 --> 21:22.447
Okay.

21:24.032 --> 21:26.201
Yeah, yeah, I know where that is.

21:27.160 --> 21:27.995
Okay.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.330
He's coming for me.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.377
But you can't do anything
until I have my daughter.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.963
Where did Abazi tell you to meet?

21:47.139 --> 21:48.932
-[Felicia] Hi, baby!
-Mommy!

21:50.851 --> 21:52.728
I did what you asked me to do.

21:54.187 --> 21:56.273
What else would I do? You had Lily.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.319
Driton, please.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.574
You're okay.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.457
FBI! Hands! Hands!

22:14.374 --> 22:16.376
[Dembe] FBI. You're under arrest.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.378
-[agent 1] Let's see them.
-[agent 2] Turn around.

22:20.380 --> 22:21.757
And clear.

22:22.507 --> 22:23.467
[agent 3] Stand down.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.681
I told you he'd disappear.

22:31.099 --> 22:32.434
[whispers] Good job.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.940
I'll update Cooper on Abazi's arrest.

22:39.024 --> 22:42.986
-Has he talked to you about Elizabeth yet?
-No. Why, what about her?

22:43.737 --> 22:45.363
[Cooper] The M.E. found the tracker.

22:45.447 --> 22:49.201
I'll get there as soon as we can.
We should discuss what comes next.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.704
Is it true about Liz?

22:52.788 --> 22:55.373
That you pulled the guards? Dug her up?

22:55.457 --> 22:58.919
I know how you feel, but I decided
it was the right thing to do.

22:59.002 --> 22:59.836
You decided?

22:59.920 --> 23:03.340
-Yes.
-Reddington put you up to this.

23:03.423 --> 23:07.302
-They found the tracker.
-All you did was desecrate her grave.

23:10.388 --> 23:12.849
Elizabeth would've wanted us to do this.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.560
She would want us to know
who's responsible for her death.

23:16.812 --> 23:19.648
You wanna know
who's responsible for killing her?

23:19.731 --> 23:20.857
It was Reddington.

23:55.642 --> 23:56.768
[Chairman] Contact Pilken.

23:56.852 --> 24:00.522
Tell him we're done with Abazi
and have him delist Banda Korçë.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.941
-The stockholders won't be happy.
-We have rules.

24:03.024 --> 24:07.195
When a company is in legal trouble,
they're sacrificed to protect the market.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.906
Clean the place,
collect every flash drive,

24:09.990 --> 24:11.825
every file, every Post-It Note.

24:11.908 --> 24:15.871
If it so much as mentions
the night market, I want it destroyed.

24:15.954 --> 24:17.539
What about Abazi? Will he talk?

24:17.622 --> 24:19.875
He's seen how we deal with informants.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.501
He won't say a word.

24:23.962 --> 24:26.089
-He won't talk.
-Did he lawyer up?

24:26.173 --> 24:28.008
No. He's terrified of the Chairman.

24:28.091 --> 24:30.302
We said we'd protect him, he laughed.

24:30.385 --> 24:31.553
[Cooper] What about Felicia?

24:31.636 --> 24:34.139
I think she'd cooperate
if it meant protecting her daughter,

24:34.222 --> 24:36.808
but I don't think she knows anything.

24:38.476 --> 24:41.813
So we're nowhere on connecting
Abazi to the night market.

24:58.246 --> 25:01.082
Hey. So I've been looking
into the tracker, and--

25:01.166 --> 25:03.752
I don't suppose
you're interested in an update.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.003
You suppose right.

25:08.298 --> 25:10.133
It is incredibly cool.

25:10.217 --> 25:13.178
I mean, uh, well, not the way
it was used, of course,

25:13.261 --> 25:15.555
but big picture, this thing is insane.

25:15.639 --> 25:18.516
It has a power supply and a microprocessor

25:18.600 --> 25:20.936
that is only activated to transmit data

25:21.019 --> 25:24.981
when it comes into contact
with the target's digestive enzymes.

25:25.523 --> 25:29.569
I must say I've had my fill of analyzing
the contents of people's stomachs of late.

25:29.653 --> 25:31.488
Oh, that's understandable.

25:31.571 --> 25:36.910
Is there a signature of any kind
to identify where it was made or by whom?

25:36.993 --> 25:39.287
I don't know. Maybe.
I need to keep looking.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.705
That's what I want you to do.

25:40.789 --> 25:44.167
There can't be many people capable
of making something this advanced.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.585
I'm confident we'll find him.

25:45.669 --> 25:48.088
More confident than I am
that we'll find the Chairman.

25:48.171 --> 25:50.173
-Abazi won't talk.
-Of course not.

25:50.882 --> 25:53.051
But you don't really need him to.

25:53.134 --> 25:54.886
He's our connection to the Chairman,

25:54.970 --> 25:56.888
a connection
we can't make unless he talks.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.598
So just say that he talked.

25:58.682 --> 26:02.519
Tell the world that you've been
investigating the night market

26:02.602 --> 26:05.438
and are preparing to shut it down.

26:05.522 --> 26:08.149
-None of which is true.
-What is true, Harold,

26:08.233 --> 26:10.151
is that rumor can drive the market.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.487
That's why Banda Korçë's stock went up,

26:12.570 --> 26:16.366
on the rumor that they'd found
the government informant.

26:16.449 --> 26:18.868
You wanna flush out the Chairman?

26:18.952 --> 26:23.081
Spread the rumor
that Abazi sang like a canary.

26:23.164 --> 26:25.750
Which no one can contradict
because he's in custody.

26:25.834 --> 26:28.253
You want me to lie at a press conference?

26:28.336 --> 26:31.131
I want you to apply situational ethics,

26:31.214 --> 26:36.219
which I find to be immensely enjoyable
and ruthlessly effective,

26:36.303 --> 26:39.806
and would make for a fantastic board game.

26:42.183 --> 26:46.855
We got everything. Notebooks, tablets.
There's nothing left that can hurt us.

26:46.938 --> 26:47.772
Yeah, it's me.

26:48.481 --> 26:50.567
We need a circuit breaker, Level 3.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.863
Yes, now, before the market
drops another 20%.

26:56.323 --> 26:58.742
-What's going on?
-I'm trying to find out.

27:01.411 --> 27:04.914
<i>Mr. Abazi is wanted in connection</i>
<i>with extortion and money laundering.</i>

27:04.998 --> 27:09.919
<i>His company also trades on a criminal</i>
<i>stock market known as the night market.</i>

27:10.003 --> 27:12.672
<i>Mr. Abazi has agreed to cooperate fully--</i>

27:13.256 --> 27:15.300
Call a meeting. All the board members.

27:15.383 --> 27:18.136
-Can't believe he talked.
-He didn't. It's a trick.

27:18.219 --> 27:20.472
I need to make sure
nobody else falls for it.

27:22.140 --> 27:25.393
Chum's in the water.
Our shark won't be able to resist.

27:25.477 --> 27:28.104
-I hope you're right.
<i>-Take the win, Harold.</i>

27:28.188 --> 27:29.773
You did well.

27:34.986 --> 27:35.820
[buzzing]

27:40.992 --> 27:45.080
-[distorted voice] <i>Andrew Kennison.</i>
-I don't know who that is.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.332
<i>-I need him to go away.</i>
-Go away?

27:47.415 --> 27:50.043
Disappear, new identity, new life.

27:50.126 --> 27:52.754
-Why?
<i>-Because I said so.</i>

28:00.095 --> 28:04.140
Lew, I'm glad you got a lead, but
the bartender's friend will have to wait.

28:04.224 --> 28:06.559
He called, with a demand.

28:06.643 --> 28:09.354
I can't talk about it now.
Just get here soon.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.273
-Any word from Ressler?
-No.

28:12.357 --> 28:14.484
I reached out, but he didn't answer.

28:14.567 --> 28:16.194
-I'm worried about him.
-He's upset.

28:16.277 --> 28:18.279
Understandable. But he'll be fine.

28:18.363 --> 28:22.200
Sir, your bluff worked. Check it out.
It is a huge sell-off.

28:22.283 --> 28:25.662
The rumor about Abazi telling us
about the night market spooked investors.

28:25.745 --> 28:28.498
The market was down 20%
before trading was halted.

28:28.581 --> 28:29.999
Hang on. Can you stop it?

28:30.083 --> 28:33.294
-Every stock is down, except that.
-[Cooper] An interesting anomaly.

28:33.378 --> 28:36.756
But I don't see how one company bucking
the market is relevant to our case.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.634
Maybe not. But that is a company
I wish I could invest in.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.094
In a way you do.

28:41.177 --> 28:44.556
"COC" stands for Concierge of Crime.

28:44.639 --> 28:46.933
Reddington. It's his company.

28:47.016 --> 28:49.102
You told your investors it was a bluff.

28:49.185 --> 28:52.272
That's why your stock's going up
and everybody else is tanking.

28:52.355 --> 28:55.275
-You traded on insider information.
-I didn't.

28:55.358 --> 28:57.360
But not on principle, mind you.

28:57.444 --> 29:00.321
I'd do it if it were in my interest.
But in this case, it's not.

29:00.405 --> 29:03.283
You didn't bring us this case
to take down the night market

29:03.366 --> 29:04.868
but to drive up your share price.

29:04.951 --> 29:09.038
Actually, I was aiming for bankruptcy
and all the freedom that that implies.

29:09.122 --> 29:12.292
You know, between the exhumation
and other things I'm dealing with,

29:12.375 --> 29:14.377
I don't have the bandwidth
for your nonsense.

29:14.461 --> 29:16.254
<i>Other things? Do tell.</i>

29:16.337 --> 29:18.089
Why? You never do.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.216
Harold, the market is teetering,

29:20.300 --> 29:22.927
but it will recover unless
you move on the Chairman.

29:23.011 --> 29:26.306
<i>Thanks to your bluff,</i>
<i>I know how you can do that.</i>

29:26.389 --> 29:28.057
-How?
<i>-He's called a meeting.</i>

29:28.141 --> 29:30.351
<i>-I'm on my way to it now.</i>
-Where?

29:30.435 --> 29:34.939
I'll tell you, but first, you'll have to
give me time to say my piece and go.

29:37.025 --> 29:40.236
Some of you are new to the market,
others have been listed for years.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.698
But this is the first time
any of us have met in person.

29:43.782 --> 29:48.536
That should give you an idea of
how important I feel this meeting is.

29:48.620 --> 29:53.500
Now, together, your companies
represent 15% of our market cap.

29:53.583 --> 29:56.044
What you do matters.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.379
If you panic, others panic.

29:58.463 --> 30:01.549
If you don't, we can weather any storm.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.259
But can we weather the FBI?

30:03.343 --> 30:05.595
Well, if they have anything, maybe not.

30:05.678 --> 30:08.431
But they don't. Abazi didn't talk.

30:08.973 --> 30:10.725
Now, the FBI said that he did

30:10.809 --> 30:13.937
because they wanna scare investors,
get them to panic.

30:14.020 --> 30:15.563
If they could hurt us, they would.

30:15.647 --> 30:19.734
But they can't, so they started a rumor
hoping we'll hurt ourselves,

30:19.818 --> 30:22.529
and that is exactly what we're doing.

30:22.612 --> 30:26.574
Twenty-five million.
I'll put that in the market by tomorrow,

30:26.658 --> 30:31.621
a leadership investment to calm
some obviously frayed nerves.

30:31.704 --> 30:33.706
Mr. Reddington, thank you.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.166
That is what we need.

30:35.250 --> 30:40.755
Send a signal to the other investors
that the FBI is all sizzle, no steak.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.049
-I do have one condition.
-Which is?

30:43.132 --> 30:45.760
The name of the lead investor
in my company.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.679
I'm afraid I can't do that.

30:49.722 --> 30:51.224
Thirty million.

30:51.307 --> 30:54.018
Mr. Reddington, I talked about privacy.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.353
We have rules.

30:55.436 --> 30:57.605
Bend them. Thirty-five.

30:58.231 --> 31:01.317
-Give me a number. You must have one.
-But I don't.

31:01.401 --> 31:03.361
You're willing to risk the market

31:03.444 --> 31:06.531
to protect the identity
of a single investor?

31:06.614 --> 31:10.702
I designed the market interface
to protect against this kind of bribe.

31:10.785 --> 31:12.036
Or was that a threat?

31:12.120 --> 31:15.248
I anticipated the need
to keep men like you

31:15.331 --> 31:17.333
from hanging me off the side of a building

31:17.417 --> 31:20.712
every time they felt cheated
by a short sale,

31:20.795 --> 31:25.508
so I made sure the identity of
each and every investor was shielded,

31:25.592 --> 31:26.676
even from me.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.971
Well, I'm sure you all
have more to discuss,

31:30.054 --> 31:33.725
but I've said what I came to say
and heard what I care to hear,

31:33.808 --> 31:35.101
so please excuse me.

31:38.187 --> 31:39.731
[door opens]

31:42.817 --> 31:44.444
Andrew Kennison. Who is he?

31:44.527 --> 31:45.820
[Cooper] An MIT grad student.

31:46.446 --> 31:48.781
What his connection is to this,
I have no idea.

31:48.865 --> 31:50.825
Voicebox wants him disappeared.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.535
New ID, a new life.

31:52.619 --> 31:54.704
Okay. So that's what you do.

31:54.787 --> 31:56.915
-Kidnap a grad student?
-Buy time.

31:56.998 --> 31:59.042
Keep voicebox happy
until we've had a chance

31:59.125 --> 32:00.668
to talk to the bartender's friend.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.046
I've got a line on her.
She headed down south.

32:03.129 --> 32:05.506
Maybe she could tell us
who put him up to doping you,

32:05.590 --> 32:07.425
which would prove your innocence.

32:07.508 --> 32:09.052
[phone ringing]

32:10.970 --> 32:11.930
Not a good time.

32:12.013 --> 32:15.224
Then I'll be brief. 3726 Sheridan Road.

32:15.308 --> 32:17.602
They have backup, so come heavy.

32:19.228 --> 32:21.814
What can we tell Kennison
to convince him to come with me?

32:21.898 --> 32:23.107
My vote? The truth.

32:24.192 --> 32:27.320
I need to speak with my team,
give them an assignment.

32:27.403 --> 32:29.489
Then I'll pay Mr. Kennison a visit.

32:31.032 --> 32:35.244
Yes, while a leveraged buyback will
increase the debit on your balance sheet,

32:35.328 --> 32:37.497
-we have a number of offshore--
-[agent] FBI!

32:37.580 --> 32:38.915
Hands up!

32:47.173 --> 32:48.216
[man] Fine, fine.

32:49.425 --> 32:50.927
Abazi did talk.

32:51.010 --> 32:52.428
Sang like a bird.

32:52.512 --> 32:53.596
And the melody...

32:54.639 --> 32:55.890
it was all about you.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.193
Andrew Kennison?

33:07.276 --> 33:11.322
-Harold Cooper, FBI.
-Whoa. What's this about?

33:11.406 --> 33:13.700
We have reason to believe
your life is in danger.

33:13.783 --> 33:17.120
An agent with the Bureau
has been compromised.

33:17.203 --> 33:18.579
He's being blackmailed,

33:18.663 --> 33:21.207
and the blackmailer
wants him to abduct you.

33:21.290 --> 33:24.627
-That's insane. Why?
-I was hoping you could tell me.

33:24.711 --> 33:28.006
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Is this some kind of joke?

33:28.089 --> 33:30.925
This is deadly serious.
I've contacted the Marshals Service.

33:31.009 --> 33:34.137
They'll move you somewhere safe
until the danger has passed.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.222
Move me? Move me where?

33:36.305 --> 33:38.141
I'll explain it all in the car.

33:40.518 --> 33:43.271
[Dembe] The codes,
how do you decrypt them?

33:43.896 --> 33:46.566
We have rules. I don't break them.

33:50.069 --> 33:52.613
Name the companies
that trade on the night market

33:52.697 --> 33:55.825
and you can help yourself.
Perhaps, save yourself.

33:55.908 --> 33:57.493
I'm here because you lied.

33:57.577 --> 34:00.329
Now you want me to break my word?
And you're the good guys.

34:00.413 --> 34:03.624
You created a market that channeled
billions into criminal enterprises.

34:03.708 --> 34:06.836
Enron, Tyco, AIG, Freddie Mac.

34:06.919 --> 34:09.047
Who channeled billions to them?

34:09.130 --> 34:13.551
Have you arrested anyone on Wall Street
who financed their crimes?

34:13.634 --> 34:16.512
Hey, how about credit default swaps?

34:16.596 --> 34:17.722
Sub-prime lending?

34:17.805 --> 34:21.601
In 2008, those markets
crashed the world economy,

34:21.684 --> 34:25.104
wiped out over $10 trillion
worth of wealth,

34:25.188 --> 34:28.357
cost 8 million people their jobs.

34:28.441 --> 34:31.277
Did you arrest anyone for that? Oh, yeah.

34:31.903 --> 34:33.112
One guy.

34:34.906 --> 34:35.823
One.

34:37.366 --> 34:39.285
I may lose my freedom,

34:39.368 --> 34:41.370
but if it's all the same to you...

34:42.747 --> 34:44.499
I'll keep my integrity.

34:46.334 --> 34:48.836
[Raymond] Harold, come in. Have a seat.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.633
-Can I get you anything?
-No, I'm fine.

34:59.263 --> 35:01.474
After Elizabeth died...

35:02.975 --> 35:03.810
I...

35:06.354 --> 35:08.022
let things go.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.065
A lot of things.

35:09.148 --> 35:13.361
People, businesses,
trade routes, landing rights.

35:13.861 --> 35:15.279
Streams of income.

35:16.489 --> 35:18.199
When I came back, I was...

35:19.492 --> 35:20.535
illiquid.

35:20.618 --> 35:24.413
So I incorporated
and sold stock on the night market

35:24.497 --> 35:25.998
and got what I needed.

35:26.082 --> 35:27.875
And something I didn't.

35:28.626 --> 35:31.337
Greenmail, a hostile takeover.

35:31.420 --> 35:32.755
By whom? I don't know.

35:32.839 --> 35:37.176
But someone courted
my shareholders in secret and bought

35:37.677 --> 35:42.557
a controlling interest in my... company.

35:42.640 --> 35:46.060
That's why you wanted to drive down
the share price, to force them out.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.396
Yes, but they refused to sell.

35:49.021 --> 35:52.066
Whoever it is, has a stranglehold
on me and they won't let go.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.986
That's what you wanted
from the Chairman, a name.

35:57.071 --> 35:59.740
The tracking device, where are we on it?

35:59.824 --> 36:03.494
According to Aram, there's nothing
in DARPA's files or the NSF.

36:03.578 --> 36:06.414
He's still looking,
but we haven't traced it to anyone yet.

36:07.874 --> 36:10.459
-You think they're connected.
-Maybe.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.838
Or had someone give it to her.

36:16.132 --> 36:18.092
Does it work? To calm you down?

36:18.176 --> 36:21.053
And if so, can you teach me how to do it?

36:22.054 --> 36:24.265
The other things you're dealing with.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.355
I'm down a path.

36:32.565 --> 36:36.777
It's dark, and taking me
to places I don't wanna go.

36:37.403 --> 36:38.905
I wanna turn back...

36:40.948 --> 36:42.200
but I don't know how.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.870
I was born to a dark path.

36:46.412 --> 36:47.997
It's the only path I know.

36:48.831 --> 36:52.543
I've learned how to
recognize light when I see it.

36:52.627 --> 36:55.755
To stop and stare.

36:56.964 --> 36:58.132
I reach for it.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.676
In the hope that it will...

37:01.802 --> 37:03.471
shed its light on me.

37:05.223 --> 37:07.099
And every once in a while,

37:07.183 --> 37:12.396
I'm able to bask in its warmth
for a moment, before...

37:14.482 --> 37:16.025
moving on in the dark.

37:20.863 --> 37:22.240
That's my life.

37:28.621 --> 37:30.164
Don't make it yours.

37:30.706 --> 37:33.918
Go home to your wife and kid.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.056
Hey.

37:48.474 --> 37:49.600
Hey.

37:49.684 --> 37:50.851
You okay?

37:51.978 --> 37:54.230
I'm told they're bringing her back.

37:54.313 --> 37:55.481
Are you okay?

37:56.607 --> 37:59.193
I didn't fall off the wagon,
if that's what you're asking.

38:00.653 --> 38:01.821
I thought about it.

38:03.072 --> 38:05.783
These last few weeks, I felt so good.

38:07.034 --> 38:07.952
But this?

38:09.912 --> 38:12.748
I'm not gonna lie,
this was a real gut punch.

38:12.832 --> 38:13.916
Of course it was.

38:14.750 --> 38:18.671
But you need to find a way
to take life's punches without slipping.

38:19.922 --> 38:22.174
And we're here to help you do that.

38:22.758 --> 38:23.592
"We"?

38:23.676 --> 38:27.430
I was worried. I didn't know
where you'd gone, so I told them.

38:27.513 --> 38:29.015
Told them what?

38:29.098 --> 38:31.475
Everything, back to the pee test.

38:31.976 --> 38:33.436
I get it if you're mad.

38:33.936 --> 38:36.480
but they care for you and wanna help.

38:36.564 --> 38:37.857
It's all good.

38:38.566 --> 38:40.151
None of us are perfect.

38:40.234 --> 38:44.322
Look, I appreciate what you're doing,
but we're not in the same boat.

38:44.405 --> 38:47.825
Okay, I walked away
from a multimillion-dollar startup

38:47.908 --> 38:53.080
after blowing my life savings and the life
savings of my closest friend's parents.

38:53.164 --> 38:56.083
I lied to my husband
about being a field agent.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.919
You also lied about being a paid assassin.

39:00.087 --> 39:03.924
He offered blind loyalty
to the most wanted fugitive in the world.

39:04.967 --> 39:07.094
I wake up in strange rooms.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.346
Naked.

39:08.929 --> 39:10.514
Covered in vomit.

39:12.099 --> 39:14.393
You're right. That's a different boat.

39:15.019 --> 39:16.187
It's a different ocean.

39:16.270 --> 39:17.730
Which is why we're here.

39:20.816 --> 39:22.860
You can't slay demons alone.

39:22.943 --> 39:23.986
None of us can.

39:32.995 --> 39:36.916
Look, if you don't wanna do this for us,
then let us do it for her.

39:45.966 --> 39:47.885
It's what she'd expect us to do.

40:04.360 --> 40:05.528
[Cooper] Look who I found.

40:05.611 --> 40:06.695
Meems!

40:10.366 --> 40:12.493
-Where was she?
-In Pinky's car.

40:12.576 --> 40:14.662
You left her there after the opera.

40:21.460 --> 40:24.004
You know you can ask me anything.

40:25.381 --> 40:28.426
About your mom, your grandparents.

40:28.509 --> 40:32.221
Whatever questions you have,
I'll tell you what I know.

40:33.889 --> 40:34.723
Okay.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.726
About Mimi too.

40:38.936 --> 40:39.770
Mimi?

40:39.854 --> 40:41.939
She's a very special bunny.

40:42.731 --> 40:44.233
See this scar?

40:44.316 --> 40:47.403
She got it after your grandfather
hid a flash drive inside of her

40:47.486 --> 40:50.573
that contained a very important secret.

40:52.158 --> 40:53.367
What kind of secret?

40:53.451 --> 40:56.036
A secret that changed
the course of world history.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.080
The entire world is the way it is

40:58.164 --> 41:00.833
because of a secret
hidden inside that bunny.

41:02.334 --> 41:03.752
By my grandfather?

41:04.253 --> 41:05.254
Yes.

41:06.130 --> 41:07.298
Raymond Reddington.

41:08.048 --> 41:09.925
That's Pinky's name.

41:10.009 --> 41:12.970
Yes, well, it's a long story.

41:13.888 --> 41:15.639
But it's my story.

41:16.432 --> 41:17.600
Yes, I guess it is.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.143
Tell it.

41:23.606 --> 41:25.191
[Frankie Miller's "After All" playing]
