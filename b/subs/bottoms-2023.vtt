00:19.270 --> 00:21.230
[upbeat rock music playing]

00:28.650 --> 00:30.180
[PJ] <i>Tonight is</i>
<i>the fucking night, okay?</i>

00:30.380 --> 00:33.810
We've looked like shit
for years,
and we are developing.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.770
I would say I'm actually
mostly developed.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.980
We're finally hot.
At least, according to me.

00:39.180 --> 00:40.440
We're getting out there.

00:40.640 --> 00:41.980
We're getting in the cooch,
my girl.

00:42.180 --> 00:44.690
We are getting in the puss
and we're gettin' wet.

00:44.890 --> 00:46.360
Man, speak for yourself.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.490
Nobody's gonna wanna
fuck me this year,

00:48.690 --> 00:50.950
just like nobody wanted
to fuck me last year
or the year before.

00:51.150 --> 00:53.410
Okay, well, I'm gonna talk
to Brittany.

00:53.610 --> 00:54.490
I think that it's time.

00:54.690 --> 00:55.700
Oh, really? It's time?

00:55.900 --> 00:57.950
There wasn't time
in the last 11 years

00:58.150 --> 00:59.500
we've all been going
to school together?

00:59.700 --> 01:00.790
I've been building tension.

01:00.990 --> 01:02.170
You know,
you could say hi to Isabel.

01:02.370 --> 01:03.290
Yeah, okay.

01:03.490 --> 01:04.790
And just what would I say?

01:04.990 --> 01:08.260
Like, "Hey, girl, what's up?
How's your boyfriend?

01:08.460 --> 01:10.090
How's his penis?

01:10.290 --> 01:13.090
Still awesome and big
and throbbing and, uh,
like a male penis?"

01:13.290 --> 01:14.800
They could have broken up,
you never know.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.600
The fair is like
a completely fresh start.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.270
I'm not doin' that
with Isabel,
you know what I mean?

01:19.470 --> 01:22.520
Like, I'm... I'm...
I'm playin' the long game
with her, okay?

01:22.720 --> 01:24.520
- Mmm.
- Here's how it's gonna
shake out.

01:24.720 --> 01:26.820
I don't speak to the bitch
for years.

01:27.020 --> 01:30.030
Bam! It's the 20th
high school reunion.

01:30.230 --> 01:31.490
I show up,
I'm in a little suit

01:31.690 --> 01:33.570
like the lesbian I am,
you know what I mean?

01:33.770 --> 01:34.780
It's probably white, okay?

01:34.980 --> 01:37.290
She looks at me,
I look back at her.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.370
What the fuck happened to her?

01:39.570 --> 01:41.910
She's washed up.

01:42.110 --> 01:43.880
I mean Jeff has
run her ragged.

01:44.070 --> 01:47.000
That's when my ass
swoops in, okay?

01:47.200 --> 01:50.590
That made me so sad.
What? Okay.

01:50.790 --> 01:52.090
Josie, tick-tock.

01:52.290 --> 01:54.180
We're not gonna be sexy
little high schoolers forever.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.140
Soon we're gonna be old hags
in college.

01:56.340 --> 01:58.390
Do you wanna be the only
girl virgin at Sarah Lawrence?

01:58.590 --> 01:59.470
Yeah, honestly, maybe.

01:59.670 --> 02:01.060
I might have a good shot
that way.

02:01.260 --> 02:04.500
I don't need this negative,
really sad attitude. Please.

02:05.620 --> 02:07.250
What the fuck are you wearing?

02:09.420 --> 02:11.530
It's really not too late
to turn around, you know?

02:11.730 --> 02:13.320
I think you wanna be here.

02:13.520 --> 02:14.740
Who said that?

02:14.940 --> 02:16.240
- Where'd you get that idea?
- I'm just feeling...

02:16.440 --> 02:19.410
You're getting nervous because
of how excited you are.

02:19.610 --> 02:21.910
- No. No, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:22.110 --> 02:23.790
Oh, and we're crossing.
And we're getting in there.

02:23.990 --> 02:26.080
No, I can't, I'm sorry.
Ahhh! Fuck, my arm!

02:26.280 --> 02:27.380
There's nothing wrong
with your arm.

02:27.580 --> 02:28.960
You have Munchausen's.

02:29.160 --> 02:30.670
Look, just follow my lead.

02:30.870 --> 02:32.050
- Hello, ladies.
- [girl 1] Oh.

02:32.250 --> 02:33.380
[girl 2 chuckles] Oh.
You know what?

02:33.580 --> 02:34.630
- Just keep going.
- [PJ] How was your summer?

02:34.830 --> 02:36.430
- Good to see you.
- Okay, you know what?

02:36.630 --> 02:37.890
Uh, it's not gonna
happen, okay?

02:38.090 --> 02:39.890
This school has such
a gay problem.

02:40.090 --> 02:42.480
Okay, no.
No one hates us for being gay.

02:42.670 --> 02:46.060
Everyone hates us for being
gay, untalented, and ugly.

02:46.260 --> 02:47.980
Like, look at Matthieu.

02:48.180 --> 02:49.770
[boy] Rock on, man. Killin' it.

02:49.970 --> 02:52.070
I love what you're doing
with the school play.

02:52.270 --> 02:53.880
- Thanks, bitch.
- [Matthieu and boy chuckle]

02:54.960 --> 02:57.070
- Fuck!
- Yeah.

02:57.270 --> 02:58.570
Knocks it out of the park,
every year.

02:58.770 --> 03:00.540
- Every show.
- Yeah.

03:00.730 --> 03:02.870
- [Isabel giggles]
- [PJ] Ooh. Popcorn.

03:03.070 --> 03:04.050
Don't mind if I do.

03:06.310 --> 03:08.270
- [gentle music playing]
- [laughing]

03:15.690 --> 03:17.930
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Hazel.

03:18.130 --> 03:20.260
Oh, hey, Hazel.
How was your summer?

03:20.460 --> 03:22.470
Were you with your uncle
at the slop farm?

03:22.670 --> 03:24.870
If you mean volunteering at
the National Meat Association,

03:25.990 --> 03:27.310
yeah, it was good.

03:27.510 --> 03:28.730
What are you guys doing here?

03:28.930 --> 03:29.810
You guys never come
to the fair.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.110
What happened to your arm?

03:31.310 --> 03:33.480
Oh, my God,
she ate shit is what happened.

03:33.680 --> 03:34.940
She ate literal shit?
What the fuck?

03:35.140 --> 03:37.110
- Mmm.
- Or did you get beat up again?

03:37.310 --> 03:38.820
[Josie] No, I just tripped
and I--

03:39.020 --> 03:40.830
Or were you jumped?
Was it spy camp?

03:41.020 --> 03:42.370
Did you go to juvie?

03:42.570 --> 03:44.000
- Yeah, we went to juvie.
- [man] <i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

03:44.190 --> 03:45.540
- Oh, my God, it was juvie?
- ... <i>it's time to get ready,</i>

03:45.740 --> 03:49.210
<i>get wild, and get horny</i>
<i>for our very own Vikings!</i>

03:49.410 --> 03:51.040
Oh, my God, what did you do?

03:51.240 --> 03:53.630
- [Josie yelping]
- [man] <i>And the man</i>
<i>who will lead us to victory</i>

03:53.830 --> 03:55.720
<i>against the evil, maniacal,</i>

03:55.910 --> 03:58.090
<i>shit-eating</i>
<i>Huntington Ferrets,</i>

03:58.290 --> 04:00.510
<i>let's hear it for Jeff!</i>

04:00.710 --> 04:02.180
[girl 3] Jeff! Have my babies!

04:02.380 --> 04:03.890
[girl 4] Jeff,
fill me with your seed!

04:04.090 --> 04:05.350
- [crowd cheers]
- [PJ groans]

04:05.550 --> 04:06.890
[PJ] I just don't get why girls
like guys like that.

04:07.090 --> 04:09.690
It's like they're like dogs,
or pigs, or is there a...

04:09.890 --> 04:11.210
What's the grossest animal?

04:12.620 --> 04:14.230
[girl 5] Jeff,
come sign my tits!

04:14.430 --> 04:16.460
- [whistle blows]
- [girl 6] Eat my pussy!

04:18.340 --> 04:19.340
That's right.

04:21.050 --> 04:23.410
Oh, fuck. Uh, Hazel.

04:23.610 --> 04:25.620
Gimme that.
Josie, take this. Take this.

04:25.820 --> 04:27.120
- Take this.
- [Josie] No.

04:27.320 --> 04:28.620
Really quick.
This is the moment.

04:28.820 --> 04:30.500
Stop yelling at me!

04:30.700 --> 04:31.850
Could you give that back
really quickly?

04:32.640 --> 04:33.920
- Hey, Brittany.
- PJ.

04:34.120 --> 04:36.630
[PJ] I am loving all the...

04:36.830 --> 04:38.380
holes in your pants.

04:38.580 --> 04:39.510
Thanks.

04:39.710 --> 04:41.510
You look like
a little Dutch boy.

04:41.710 --> 04:42.640
[PJ] Thank you.

04:42.840 --> 04:44.970
So, Britt...
Can I call you Britt?

04:45.170 --> 04:47.020
I prefer if you just
called me my name.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.520
- Britt-a-nay. Um, but...
- [Brittany] No, not that.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.150
[PJ] Brittany.

04:51.340 --> 04:52.650
Are you thinking of riding
the Ferris wheel
at all tonight?

04:52.850 --> 04:55.150
I wasn't. I'm going
on the puke and duke.

04:55.350 --> 04:56.230
I need to pull trig.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.740
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

04:57.930 --> 04:58.950
I'm gonna say something crazy.

04:59.140 --> 05:02.570
I think you could eat food,

05:02.770 --> 05:05.160
digest it, let it marinate,
poop it out.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.490
Mmm, gross.

05:06.690 --> 05:08.160
Maybe this?
You want a bite of this?

05:08.360 --> 05:10.460
- [Brittany] Oh, no.
- Yeah, this is fucking
disgusting. Ugh.

05:10.660 --> 05:12.330
You want a hot dog?
We could go get hot dogs.

05:12.530 --> 05:13.630
Oh, I don't know.

05:13.830 --> 05:15.000
Yeah, we could get the bun
and the ketchup.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.130
- No bun. No.
- You gotta get the bun.

05:17.330 --> 05:18.970
- Yes, you could.
- No.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.010
No bun. [clears throat] Okay.

05:21.210 --> 05:23.300
Um, Isabel.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.600
Josie was just saying
something similar to me.

05:25.800 --> 05:26.760
I don't think so.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.430
[PJ] I think so.
It was really good.

05:28.630 --> 05:29.950
It was super funny.

05:31.620 --> 05:33.440
[PJ clears throat]

05:33.640 --> 05:37.460
You're just so--
You're skinny too, as well.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.900
I'm Josie, by the way,
good evening.

05:41.100 --> 05:42.660
Yeah, you're skinny--

05:42.850 --> 05:44.120
You're real skinny minnie,
aren't ya?

05:44.310 --> 05:46.120
You probably should eat.

05:46.320 --> 05:48.540
They're gonna send you
to the hospital
with how skinny you are.

05:48.740 --> 05:51.100
Uh-oh, call the doctor.
Skinny girl, I see.

05:53.430 --> 05:54.790
Okay, do you guys want
any of our tickets?

05:54.990 --> 05:56.020
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

05:57.520 --> 06:00.720
[groans] Fuck! Fuck!

06:00.910 --> 06:02.720
I don't want to say it,
but we're fucked.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.260
You know what? I'm good.

06:04.460 --> 06:06.260
'Cause it's not gonna happen
for me.

06:06.460 --> 06:07.720
If it's not happening here,

06:07.920 --> 06:10.470
then it's definitely not
happening at Emerson, okay?

06:10.670 --> 06:12.690
I'm done trying to sow
my damn oats.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.770
- No.
- I'm packing up my vagina

06:14.970 --> 06:16.360
and I'm fucking Matthieu.

06:16.560 --> 06:17.820
That's the only hope for me.

06:18.010 --> 06:19.360
- No.
- It's me and Matthieu, man.

06:19.560 --> 06:20.780
And 'cause he's gay
and fearless,

06:20.980 --> 06:22.570
he's probably gonna fuck me
without protection.

06:22.770 --> 06:23.780
Then I'm gonna get pregnant.

06:23.980 --> 06:24.860
We're going to have
to join a church.

06:25.060 --> 06:26.160
He'll be the gay pastor.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.740
My whole life's fucked!

06:27.940 --> 06:29.580
And yeah, sure,
his sermons are good,

06:29.780 --> 06:31.330
but everybody knows
he's fruity.

06:31.530 --> 06:33.750
Everybody knows
he's fucking fruity!

06:33.950 --> 06:36.460
By the way, our son, Hezekiah,
hates us

06:36.660 --> 06:38.130
'cause he knows
we're both closeted,

06:38.330 --> 06:40.300
but we try to make it
work for him,
but he's not happy.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.710
And yeah, guess what?

06:41.910 --> 06:44.550
The deacon's fucking
the evangelist, man!

06:44.750 --> 06:46.930
He's fucking the evangelist!

06:47.130 --> 06:49.850
[crying] I don't wanna
live like that.

06:50.050 --> 06:52.680
Will you come and visit us
on Sundays?

06:52.880 --> 06:56.560
Please, will you come
and visit us on Sundays?

06:56.760 --> 06:59.480
- [Jeff] Isabel.
- [Isabel] Leave me alone!

06:59.680 --> 07:00.860
- Stop following me.
- Wait, shut up.

07:01.060 --> 07:02.110
- What?
- Look.

07:02.310 --> 07:03.990
- [Isabel] Don't touch me.
- Isabel, baby.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.400
My teeny, tiny baby girl.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.570
Why do you always have
to flirt with other women?

07:07.770 --> 07:09.830
It doesn't count
if they're not in high school.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.160
Especially Mrs. Reilly!

07:11.360 --> 07:13.160
- Josie, offer her a ride.
- I don't think so.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.250
Yes, come on.

07:14.450 --> 07:15.790
...Irish Catholic.

07:15.990 --> 07:17.210
- And I'm regular Christian!
- [groaning in frustration]

07:17.410 --> 07:18.960
- [PJ] Josie, ask her. Come on.
- [Josie] PJ, stop.

07:19.160 --> 07:20.840
[Jeff grunts]
You're hurting my head.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.300
You're attacking me,
and it's giving me a migraine.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.670
And it's giving me PTSD
about all the other times
I've had migraines.

07:25.870 --> 07:27.590
- Just do it now.
- No.

07:27.790 --> 07:29.530
- Just go fucking ask her.
- No. Isabel, would you
like a safety ride?

07:30.400 --> 07:31.410
Isabel.

07:32.870 --> 07:34.180
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

07:34.380 --> 07:35.600
- [Jeff] Isabel...
- [Isabel breathes heavily]

07:35.800 --> 07:37.100
Get out of the car.

07:37.300 --> 07:38.440
You can't tell me what to do.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.310
- Yeah, no, he can't.
- [Jeff] Okay,

07:40.510 --> 07:43.360
I'm sorry that I looked
at Mrs. Reilly

07:43.560 --> 07:45.490
and lightly grazed
her left tit, all right?

07:45.690 --> 07:47.740
- Move, you prick!
- [groans]

07:47.940 --> 07:49.780
Uh, excuse me,
she said, "Move, prick."

07:49.980 --> 07:50.950
Don't talk to me,
you ugly bitch, okay?

07:51.150 --> 07:53.700
I do not talk to girls
in overalls.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.960
- Hey.
- Okay, I might be ugly,
but these aren't overalls.

07:56.150 --> 07:58.460
Isabel, get out
of the freaking car! Get out!

07:58.660 --> 08:00.130
Get out! Come on.

08:00.330 --> 08:01.290
- I feel like
we should just drive.
- Drive.

08:01.490 --> 08:02.590
- Drive.
- Let's just go.

08:02.790 --> 08:04.170
Please. You're being
really mean right now.

08:04.370 --> 08:05.510
- He'll move.
- He's not moving.

08:05.710 --> 08:06.630
[Isabel] He's gonna move.

08:06.830 --> 08:08.050
- [PJ] We're about to drive.
- Isabel.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.050
- Drive. He'll move.
- [PJ] Just drive. Josie, go.

08:10.250 --> 08:12.510
- Three, two one...
- Pedal to the metal. Drive!

08:12.710 --> 08:13.740
[tires screech]

08:17.490 --> 08:18.490
[squealing]

08:21.750 --> 08:23.360
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

08:23.560 --> 08:24.630
Jeff?

08:25.920 --> 08:27.280
Jeff!

08:27.480 --> 08:28.570
- [Jeff groaning]
- [Josie] Are you...
Are you okay?

08:28.770 --> 08:29.740
When people move cars,
don't people move?

08:29.940 --> 08:31.530
Jeffrey, I'm coming!
I'm coming!

08:31.730 --> 08:33.120
You're not alone.
You're not alone.

08:33.320 --> 08:35.660
- Back up! Back up! [screams]
- We didn't even do anything.

08:35.860 --> 08:39.000
- No, come here. [grunting]
- [groaning]

08:39.200 --> 08:40.250
- Man down! Man down!
- [Jeff] You!

08:40.450 --> 08:41.580
[PJ] Oh, my God.

08:41.780 --> 08:43.290
- I'm... I'm blacking out.
- No, stay with me.

08:43.490 --> 08:44.590
[PJ] We should go. Let's go.

08:44.790 --> 08:46.050
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Okay.

08:46.250 --> 08:47.630
Let's just kind of
peel on out.

08:47.830 --> 08:49.130
- [Josie] Fine.
- What did you do to him?

08:49.330 --> 08:51.050
Buckle it for me. Fuck!

08:51.250 --> 08:53.390
- [Jeff wailing]
- You fucking cowards!

08:53.590 --> 08:54.610
You better fucking run!

08:55.740 --> 08:58.430
[Jeff] I don't understand.
What the fuck? [sobs]

08:58.630 --> 09:01.690
[yelling] They're not gonna
get away with this!

09:01.890 --> 09:03.120
[Jeff crying]

09:05.330 --> 09:06.360
[Principal Meyers, over PA]
<i>Attention.</i>

09:06.560 --> 09:08.280
<i>The library</i>
<i>is out of use again.</i>

09:08.480 --> 09:10.400
<i>Huntington shot up</i>
<i>our remaining books,</i>

09:10.600 --> 09:14.160
<i>so there will be no reading</i>
<i>again this year. Thank you.</i>

09:14.360 --> 09:17.080
Oh, Brittany was just so cute
last night.

09:17.280 --> 09:21.250
Like, "No, I can't eat
a hot dog.

09:21.450 --> 09:24.080
I know I won't even digest it.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.250
I have to throw up."

09:25.450 --> 09:27.300
And I was, like,
"You can have it."

09:27.500 --> 09:29.420
She's like, "No, not, just...

09:29.620 --> 09:31.020
Maybe, but not the bun."

09:32.190 --> 09:34.030
Oh, it was just really sweet.

09:34.950 --> 09:35.890
You had to be there.

09:36.090 --> 09:37.030
I was there.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.230
Are you serious?

09:39.420 --> 09:40.940
I got "faggot number two"
this time?

09:41.130 --> 09:42.600
You're the sidekick, not me.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.650
'Sup, Ted? How's the family?

09:44.850 --> 09:46.670
Sick. Yeah, you know
what to do.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.280
Thanks.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.780
Do you feel like people
are looking at us?
Like, more than usual?

09:51.980 --> 09:53.450
I don't know.
Did you period yourself?

09:53.650 --> 09:55.720
Mmm... Mmm-mmm. Hey, Sylvie.

09:57.090 --> 09:58.370
Hi.

09:58.570 --> 10:00.500
[ominous music playing]

10:00.700 --> 10:02.160
Holy shit. Are you guys okay?

10:02.360 --> 10:03.710
What? Yeah.

10:03.910 --> 10:05.290
- Why wouldn't we be okay?
- [Mr. G] All right, kiddos.

10:05.490 --> 10:07.250
Welcome back to class.

10:07.450 --> 10:09.130
Hey! The prep club worked hard
on those.

10:09.330 --> 10:10.420
That belongs to the school.

10:10.620 --> 10:12.300
Oh, cool.
So, does your vagina.

10:12.500 --> 10:13.550
[scoffs] Nice try, PJ,

10:13.750 --> 10:15.470
but my vagina belongs
to the government.

10:15.670 --> 10:17.470
All right, check it out.

10:17.670 --> 10:19.910
- Today I got a special
lesson for all of you.
- Josie, so, how'd you do it?

10:20.280 --> 10:21.230
Do what?

10:21.420 --> 10:23.410
[grunts, pants]

10:24.540 --> 10:26.060
[boy] Holy shit. Is he okay?

10:26.260 --> 10:27.460
[Mr. G] Hey, you good, man?

10:29.670 --> 10:30.780
- [Jeff groans]
- What the fuck?

10:30.980 --> 10:33.070
- [Mr. G] Yeah, okay, so...
- What the fuck?

10:33.270 --> 10:34.150
[Mr. G] Meanwhile,
back at the ranch...

10:34.350 --> 10:35.570
Okay, so, did he fight back?

10:35.770 --> 10:37.120
No, literally, how did it go?
Did he fight back?

10:37.320 --> 10:38.870
- I hope you broke a bone.
- If you need a shoulder

10:39.070 --> 10:40.490
or anything,
just let me know...

10:40.690 --> 10:42.040
I heard you did
something to him,
I just don't know what.

10:42.240 --> 10:43.290
...and I'll totally let you
lean on me.

10:43.490 --> 10:45.330
No, but like honestly,
how did you do it?

10:45.530 --> 10:47.040
Oh, my God.
Annie, they went to juvie.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.170
That's how, okay?

10:48.370 --> 10:50.000
[Jeff] Hey. Hey. Hey, you.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.550
Overall bitch.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.380
This is you.

10:53.580 --> 10:55.340
- [students gasp]
- God damn it, Jeff.

10:55.540 --> 10:56.840
What the fuck?

10:57.040 --> 10:59.310
Hey, you couldn't make
that analogy with your fists?

10:59.500 --> 11:00.720
[PA chimes]

11:00.920 --> 11:03.180
[over PA] <i>Hello,</i>
<i>this is Principal Meyers</i>

11:03.380 --> 11:05.100
<i>with an important</i>
<i>Huntington update.</i>

11:05.300 --> 11:06.730
<i>So, listen to this girl.</i>

[Shelly] <i>Last night,</i>
<i>outside the fair,</i>

[Principal Meyers]
<i>We haven't faced the violence</i>

11:29.410 --> 11:30.290
They're gonna pork us!

11:30.490 --> 11:31.710
- We're fucked!
- I'm screwed.

11:31.910 --> 11:33.050
Hey. Hey, calm down
just a little bit.

11:33.250 --> 11:34.720
[sarcastically]
Oh, great. More violence.

11:34.910 --> 11:35.800
Just what this school needs.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.220
[bell rings]

11:37.420 --> 11:38.550
Seriously, that's...
that's it?

11:38.750 --> 11:40.600
- That's class?
- Latte. [snaps fingers]

11:40.800 --> 11:41.680
Get my shit.

11:41.880 --> 11:43.560
[PJ] Solid class.

11:43.760 --> 11:44.890
[Hazel groans]

11:45.090 --> 11:46.160
[Isabel] Hey.

11:47.580 --> 11:50.110
Josie, right?

11:50.310 --> 11:53.630
I heard you, like, beat up
my boyfriend last night?

11:54.420 --> 11:57.610
Um, weren't you there?

11:57.810 --> 11:59.570
I heard you guys ate
literal shit

11:59.770 --> 12:01.950
- and killed girls in juvie.
- [PJ] Really?

12:02.150 --> 12:04.410
Um, what did you think
about that?

12:04.610 --> 12:05.950
- [PA chimes]
- [Principal Meyers] <i>Excuse me.</i>

12:06.150 --> 12:08.670
<i>Could the ugly,</i>
<i>untalented gays</i>

12:08.870 --> 12:10.630
<i>please report</i>
<i>to the principal's office?</i>

12:10.830 --> 12:12.630
Guess that's you guys.

12:12.830 --> 12:15.260
Hello, Principal Meyers.
First of all, I want to say,
God bless--

12:15.460 --> 12:17.880
- Shut up. You know why you're here.
- I don't, actually...

12:18.080 --> 12:19.590
For committing a crime
against Jeff.

12:19.790 --> 12:22.050
Our quarterback
and the most good-looking,

12:22.250 --> 12:24.890
all-American, red-blooded,
muscular man
this town has ever seen.

12:25.090 --> 12:25.970
Sir, please,
look in the mirror.

12:26.170 --> 12:27.640
- Shush.
- Okay.

12:27.840 --> 12:32.060
The homecoming game
with Huntington
is nearly a month away.

12:32.260 --> 12:33.440
Do you know how long we've
been working toward this?

12:33.640 --> 12:35.190
- Yes.
- Yes. It's everywhere.

12:35.390 --> 12:36.490
- [Josie] Twenty years.
- [PJ] Couldn't be clearer.

12:36.680 --> 12:37.570
[Josie] I think I can explain.

12:37.770 --> 12:38.900
I can explain.

12:39.100 --> 12:40.950
Jeff is psychotic,
and he tried to murder us.

12:41.150 --> 12:42.450
[Principal Meyers] Ha! Sure.

12:42.650 --> 12:44.910
You're all victims, and girls
are always right. Right?

12:45.110 --> 12:46.250
Yeah, actually.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.330
How come you can't buck up

12:48.530 --> 12:51.040
and learn to protect yourselves
without running somebody over?

12:51.240 --> 12:54.210
Maybe it's because we're small
and he's giant.

12:54.410 --> 12:56.960
So, we needed to use
a little machinery.

12:57.160 --> 12:58.550
Did you ever think
of that, sir?

12:58.750 --> 13:00.720
- Can we just explain ourselves?
- Maybe I should buy a gun.

13:00.920 --> 13:03.050
Okay. What? What?
Don't buy a gun.
Nobody said buy a gun.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.060
- Can we just
calm down, everybody.
- Zip it.

13:05.260 --> 13:06.770
- You know what?
- What?

13:06.970 --> 13:09.310
- I'm gonna expel you both.
- No!

13:09.510 --> 13:10.890
- No! No!
- [Principal Meyers] Yes! Yes!

13:11.090 --> 13:14.400
You have to understand that
this was a misunderstanding.

13:14.600 --> 13:17.670
- Really?
- We were just practicing...

13:19.460 --> 13:20.800
for...

13:25.720 --> 13:26.720
for our self-defense club.

13:29.180 --> 13:30.830
Self-defense-- What is that?

13:31.030 --> 13:33.290
- [Josie] Uh...
- Is it like a fight club?

13:33.490 --> 13:35.340
- Well, here's the thing--
- Yes! Yes!

13:35.540 --> 13:37.300
- Uh...
- Yes! Yes!

13:37.500 --> 13:38.630
A fight club.

13:38.830 --> 13:41.130
Where we fuckin' beat
each other up and shit.

13:41.330 --> 13:42.220
- No, we don't.
- Yes.

13:42.420 --> 13:43.590
No, we don't. Shut up.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.050
Okay, you know what?
I don't care. Fuck it!

13:45.250 --> 13:46.430
- I don't care.
- You're over it, okay.

13:46.630 --> 13:48.470
Yeah. You can beat the shit
out of each other

13:48.670 --> 13:50.270
while you perform
<i>The Vagina Monologues.</i>

13:50.470 --> 13:52.980
Just stay in your lane
until you're munching beaver
at Wesleyan.

13:53.180 --> 13:54.810
Yes, sir.

13:55.010 --> 13:57.150
[Hazel] I can't believe
they're letting you guys
start a fight club.

13:57.350 --> 13:59.530
No, they're... they're not.
We are not.

13:59.730 --> 14:01.030
What are you talking about?
We're gonna do it.

14:01.230 --> 14:02.110
We're doing it.

14:02.310 --> 14:04.030
PJ, I wasn't being serious.

14:04.230 --> 14:07.620
Josie, did you see the way
that Isabel and Brittany
were looking at us?

14:07.820 --> 14:10.410
- [Josie groans]
- Also, you heard
the announcements.

14:10.610 --> 14:11.620
Girls are terrified.

14:11.820 --> 14:13.330
It's perfect. They need this.

14:13.530 --> 14:15.960
Okay, no. They need,
like, mace, maybe.

14:16.160 --> 14:19.170
We can't do that, okay?
We'd be misleading them.

14:19.370 --> 14:20.420
Guys do that
all the time, okay?

14:20.620 --> 14:21.590
That's the point of feminism.

14:21.790 --> 14:22.970
That's not the point
of feminism.

14:23.170 --> 14:24.840
You also don't care
about feminism.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.140
Your favorite show
is <i>Entourage.</i>

14:26.340 --> 14:27.680
You're missing the point!

14:27.880 --> 14:29.680
I don't really think I am.
We don't know how to fight.

14:29.880 --> 14:31.230
You guys probably
fought girls in juvie.

14:31.420 --> 14:33.020
No, we were lying about that,
obviously.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.520
- [grunts frustratedly]
- About juvie?

14:34.720 --> 14:36.360
- [PJ] Yeah, I mean, what?
- Why would you lie to me?

14:36.550 --> 14:37.770
You were the one who said
we went to juvie.

14:37.970 --> 14:39.190
I just didn't correct you.

14:39.390 --> 14:41.490
Listen, self-defense
is instinctual common sense.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.780
You try to punch me
in the face,
I stop it from happening.

14:43.980 --> 14:45.950
Whatever. I don't care.
It's easy.

14:46.150 --> 14:48.200
Look, this is how we do this.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.620
Okay, we start with Taekwondo.

14:49.820 --> 14:50.990
Which I've got covered.

14:51.190 --> 14:53.120
And then you guys can move
on to air punches.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.210
[PJ] Hub-bub-bub-bub.

14:54.410 --> 14:55.790
Who do we know?
Who do we know?

14:55.990 --> 14:57.040
I'll bring Stella-Rebecca.

14:57.240 --> 14:58.590
[Josie and PJ]
You know Stella-Rebecca?

14:58.790 --> 15:00.340
Stella-Rebecca who models
at car conventions

15:00.540 --> 15:02.460
- in Chicago on the weekends?
- Yeah, we're family friends.

15:02.660 --> 15:04.630
Okay, great.
Well, then bring her.

15:04.830 --> 15:05.720
[Josie sighs]

15:05.920 --> 15:07.470
- Josie.
- What?

15:07.670 --> 15:08.970
- We're doing this.
- No.

15:09.170 --> 15:10.680
Yeah. Listen to me.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.430
We teach a bunch of girls
how to defend themselves

15:12.630 --> 15:15.440
against the evil,
Huntington killers.

15:15.640 --> 15:17.100
They are grateful to us.

15:17.300 --> 15:19.650
We build a community, we bond,

15:19.850 --> 15:21.900
we share, we connect.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.900
We're punching each other,
adrenaline is flowing.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.360
Next thing you know,

15:26.560 --> 15:28.120
Isabel and Brittany
are kissing us on the mouths.

15:28.310 --> 15:29.590
- [player 1] Jeffrey!
- [PJ] Josie...

15:30.680 --> 15:32.700
Isabel knew your name.

15:32.900 --> 15:34.790
- [player 2] Back from the dead.
- If we do this...

15:34.990 --> 15:37.000
- Mmm-hmm.
- Very big "if,"

15:37.200 --> 15:38.630
we just run the risk
of becoming

15:38.830 --> 15:40.540
even bigger losers
than we already are right now.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.920
And I hate to break it to you,
but we're pretty big losers.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.260
And that is the beauty.
That is the beauty of this.

15:45.460 --> 15:47.930
Because we are literally
at the bottom.

15:48.130 --> 15:49.090
We're the lowest of the low.

15:49.290 --> 15:50.640
- Okay.
- We have nowhere to go but up.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.770
Listen, I think this is
a good idea, okay?

15:53.970 --> 15:56.440
There's a serious lack
of female solidarity
at this school.

15:56.630 --> 15:58.650
Not the point, Hazel.
Not the point.

15:58.850 --> 16:01.150
Yeah, I mean,
we just felt like

16:01.350 --> 16:03.830
there's a serious lack
of female solidarity
at this school.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.710
Anyways, totally come by.
See you later.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.700
What's your plan here?

16:10.900 --> 16:12.410
I don't need a plan.

16:12.610 --> 16:14.590
My mom has a business.
All we have to do is yell.

16:15.680 --> 16:17.060
[upbeat electronic
music playing]

16:18.180 --> 16:19.350
[PJ sighs]

16:20.810 --> 16:21.880
Okay.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.140
What's up, lads?

16:24.310 --> 16:25.340
What the fuck?

16:25.540 --> 16:27.420
- These girls are ugly.
- [Josie] Okay.

16:27.620 --> 16:28.930
Where is Stella?

16:29.130 --> 16:30.550
She was booked
for a car convention.

16:30.750 --> 16:32.180
What? It's a Monday.

16:32.380 --> 16:33.850
[Josie] Um, maybe we should go

16:34.050 --> 16:35.060
- before someone cool shows up?
- [door opens]

16:35.260 --> 16:36.640
Before I die? Pick one.

16:36.840 --> 16:39.230
[Sylvie] Hey, Hazel.
Thanks for the invite.

16:39.430 --> 16:41.190
I love David Fincher.

16:41.390 --> 16:43.730
- [sighs] Oh, my God. Well...
- See?

16:43.930 --> 16:46.740
I guess Sylvie's cute
if she lost her braces

16:46.930 --> 16:48.320
and stopped huffing paint.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.160
[Josie] She'll never stop
huffing paint.

16:50.350 --> 16:51.320
[Hazel] So, I thought
we'd start...

16:51.520 --> 16:52.470
Um...

16:53.430 --> 16:54.430
- Okay.
- Sorry.

16:55.470 --> 16:56.620
[PJ] All right.

16:56.820 --> 16:59.870
Listen up,
you cunt-sucking
pieces of shit.

17:00.070 --> 17:01.630
Welcome to our fucking
fight club.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.460
Um, it's a self-defense club.

17:03.660 --> 17:04.800
It's not really, "Fight."

17:04.990 --> 17:08.380
So, as we know,
Huntington is on the prowl,

17:08.580 --> 17:10.090
and they're picking
on the weak

17:10.290 --> 17:12.760
and defenseless,
meaning all of you.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.470
So, we're gonna teach you
how to not take shit.

17:15.670 --> 17:17.640
We're gonna start
with dropkicks,

17:17.840 --> 17:19.940
tackling, little bit
of knife play.

17:20.130 --> 17:21.600
Then, punch-bucket,

17:21.800 --> 17:23.610
which is when we throw you
in a bucket

17:23.810 --> 17:25.770
and we punch you
until you bleed.

17:25.970 --> 17:29.820
Before that,
perhaps stretches,
icebreakers, and trust falls.

17:30.020 --> 17:31.030
Is that what happened
to you in juvie?

17:31.230 --> 17:33.160
- Mmm. No. No.
- No.

17:33.360 --> 17:35.240
Juvie was way crazier.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.330
One time, this girl's
punching me in the rain.

17:37.530 --> 17:39.450
Fall to my knees. It's muddy.

17:39.650 --> 17:42.290
I get up. I'm blind.

17:42.490 --> 17:44.730
Punch her right
in the middle of her face.

17:45.690 --> 17:46.690
Broke her fuckin' nose.

17:47.560 --> 17:48.510
Josie?

17:48.700 --> 17:49.730
Care to share?

17:52.230 --> 17:53.360
Yeah, all right.

17:54.900 --> 17:56.140
Juvie was insane.

17:56.340 --> 17:59.470
Once a girl tried to kill me
with rat poison,

17:59.670 --> 18:02.450
so I took her outside
and I punched her
till she died.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.810
So, you killed a girl?

18:06.010 --> 18:07.690
Uh, no.

18:07.890 --> 18:10.860
Because the ambulance came
and revived her

18:11.060 --> 18:13.200
and we actually had a really
productive conversation

18:13.400 --> 18:15.160
when she came back
to life, so...

18:15.360 --> 18:17.990
Um, since Josie
literally killed a girl--

18:18.190 --> 18:19.790
She came back to life.

18:19.990 --> 18:22.460
Mmm. But I remember her
being dead
for at least a couple minutes.

18:22.660 --> 18:24.460
Josie is gonna start
by showing you all

18:24.660 --> 18:26.630
how to effectively throw
a solid punch.

18:26.830 --> 18:28.060
Josie, if you'll step forward.

18:29.060 --> 18:30.380
No, I don't wanna do that.

18:30.580 --> 18:32.380
- What's the problem?
- There's no problem. I just...

18:32.580 --> 18:33.970
No, I'm just not gonna do it.

18:34.170 --> 18:35.550
Come on, they wanna see
the punch.

18:35.750 --> 18:37.720
- They don't wanna see it.
- They wanna see. Look at them.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.060
They wanna see the punch.

18:39.260 --> 18:40.140
Who am I gonna punch?

18:40.340 --> 18:41.520
Punch me. Just punch me.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.190
- Punch you?
- Yeah, come on.

18:43.380 --> 18:44.270
I can punch you.

18:44.470 --> 18:45.770
Yeah. I know how
to take a punch.

18:45.970 --> 18:47.150
Something people
would always say,

18:47.350 --> 18:48.270
"PJ knows how
to take a punch."

18:48.470 --> 18:49.520
- Come on up.
- [Josie grunts]

18:49.720 --> 18:51.840
Oh! [groans, thuds]

18:52.670 --> 18:53.670
Oh, fuck!

18:55.130 --> 18:56.970
- [Josie sighs]
- [PJ breathing heavily]

19:01.010 --> 19:02.250
Will there an advisor
for this club?

19:02.450 --> 19:04.000
Because we'll be suspended
if there isn't.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.080
Who is gonna be dumb enough
to endorse a club

19:06.280 --> 19:08.140
where we punch each other
in the face?

19:09.480 --> 19:12.110
The Holocaust. It happened.

19:13.310 --> 19:14.800
Yes, it did.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.890
But how? The seeds were sown
in the <i>Treaty of Versailles,</i>

19:18.090 --> 19:20.810
which y'all are gonna reenact
while I do some little reading
over here.

19:21.010 --> 19:22.780
[PJ] I mean, he's perfect.

19:23.620 --> 19:24.810
[Josie] No.

19:25.010 --> 19:26.100
- What?
- No.

19:26.300 --> 19:27.690
Please.

19:27.890 --> 19:29.440
Dude, we're not
fucking doing this.
I broke your nose.

19:29.640 --> 19:31.320
Yeah, and I've never
had so many girls
look at me in my life.

19:31.520 --> 19:32.610
Fuck! When did you show up?

19:32.810 --> 19:34.110
Hey, guys. [chuckles]

19:34.310 --> 19:36.660
I just wanted to say thank you
so much for last night.

19:36.850 --> 19:39.700
It was just so great,
and I was thinking,

19:39.900 --> 19:41.490
like, if Huntington and me were
in an alleyway

19:41.690 --> 19:44.620
and they were coming at me
with, like, swords
and, like, knives

19:44.820 --> 19:46.410
and, like, guns and stuff,

19:46.610 --> 19:49.630
and you taught me how
to punch like that,
then I wouldn't die.

19:49.830 --> 19:52.130
- That's so great, Sylvie.
- Okay.

19:52.330 --> 19:53.380
But, unfortunately,

19:53.580 --> 19:55.090
Josie doesn't want
to do the club anymore.

19:55.290 --> 19:56.880
What? Why?

19:57.080 --> 19:57.970
I don't know.

19:58.170 --> 19:59.760
Why? It was just
so empowering.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.050
What was empowering?

20:01.250 --> 20:04.020
- Oh, my God, hi. Um...
- [players groaning]

20:04.220 --> 20:06.270
Just, we have a fight club.
It was our fight club

20:06.470 --> 20:09.400
for, um, female solidarity
at this school, which we lack.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.960
- [bell rings]
- Isabel, let's go.

20:16.540 --> 20:18.990
[Isabel giggles] Hi, boo-boo.

20:19.190 --> 20:20.450
- I'm so strong.
- [Isabel giggles]

20:20.650 --> 20:22.550
[whimsical music playing]

20:24.140 --> 20:25.140
I mean...

20:26.100 --> 20:27.470
[chuckling mischievously]

20:29.390 --> 20:32.540
- [PJ] Mr. G, G-man, G-dog.
- [Josie sighs]

20:32.740 --> 20:34.050
Great class today.

20:34.250 --> 20:36.050
Hey, uh, girl.

20:36.250 --> 20:37.550
Thanks for coming in today.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.840
We have to come in.
It's class.

20:40.040 --> 20:42.050
Try telling
Dimitri Walker that.

20:42.250 --> 20:45.390
Little motherfucker came
the first week
and I ain't seen him since.

20:45.590 --> 20:46.980
Dimitri Walker
committed suicide

20:47.170 --> 20:48.730
the first week of school,
Mr. G.

20:48.930 --> 20:51.230
[chuckles] Sure, he did.

20:51.430 --> 20:55.650
Anyways, um, we were wondering
if you wanted
to be our club advisor.

20:55.850 --> 20:57.860
- What kind of club is that?
- [PJ] It's a women's club.

20:58.060 --> 20:59.800
We talk about women's issues.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.970
For example,
periods,

21:03.760 --> 21:05.040
declining egg count,

21:05.230 --> 21:06.200
skirts...

21:06.400 --> 21:07.450
Skirts?

21:07.650 --> 21:10.330
But long ones.
Long denim skirts.

21:10.530 --> 21:13.630
Feminism is what she's saying.
Feminism as a... as a whole.

21:13.830 --> 21:15.710
Why don't you just ask
one of the female teachers?

21:15.910 --> 21:17.300
Mmm. Thought about that,
but we hate them.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.300
- Makes sense.
- [PJ] Yeah.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.050
Listen. I'm kind of,

21:20.250 --> 21:22.300
you know,
retiling the bathroom.

21:22.500 --> 21:24.970
- [PJ] Mmm-hmm.
- Uh, I gotta be at the co-op.

21:25.170 --> 21:27.970
And I'm also dealing with
some relationship drama, so...

21:28.170 --> 21:29.770
Back to the club,

21:29.970 --> 21:31.650
maybe this will be a great way
to take your mind off
of stuff.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.360
[Josie] Can I be honest?
You're a man

21:33.550 --> 21:34.980
who's not coping
with what's going on.

21:35.180 --> 21:36.440
- Yeah.
- You know what?

21:36.640 --> 21:39.070
My mom did say I need
to pick up a hobby.

21:39.270 --> 21:40.280
And here's one thing

21:40.480 --> 21:41.610
- my mom's always said to me.
- [PJ] Mmm.

21:41.810 --> 21:44.740
Sometimes, when you have
a new hobby,

21:44.940 --> 21:46.370
- don't show up.
- Yeah.

21:46.570 --> 21:48.700
[Josie] It's, like, you can be
our club advisor,

21:48.900 --> 21:50.620
- but you don't even
come to the dang club.
- No.

21:50.820 --> 21:52.750
By the way,
great way to be an ally.

21:52.950 --> 21:54.000
That's my favorite way
to be an ally.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.170
You just say
you're doing something

21:56.370 --> 21:57.920
and then you don't do
any of those things.

21:58.120 --> 22:00.090
You know what I mean?
You say, "I support women."
You don't.

22:00.290 --> 22:01.720
Don't come. Yeah.

22:01.920 --> 22:05.570
You know what? I'll sign off
on your period club.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.560
- Amazing.
- What?

22:07.760 --> 22:08.810
- Yeah.
- Really?

22:09.010 --> 22:10.160
- Okay.
- [PJ] So cool.

22:10.910 --> 22:11.910
[grunts]

22:16.000 --> 22:17.980
How many girls go
to this school, again?

22:18.180 --> 22:21.740
Oh, my God, and again,
they're all sixes at best.

22:21.940 --> 22:23.050
Hey, guys.

22:24.550 --> 22:26.780
[PJ] Mmm. Well, at least
Stella-Rebecca is here.

22:26.980 --> 22:29.910
Are you stressed?
Because I'm stressed.

22:30.110 --> 22:31.960
[Mr. G] Hey, ladies.

22:32.150 --> 22:34.100
Let's get it popping
in this motherfucker.

22:35.140 --> 22:36.310
All right. Um...

22:37.600 --> 22:38.600
Hello, everybody.

22:39.270 --> 22:40.630
Okay, excuse me.

22:40.830 --> 22:42.090
Sorry, I feel... Sorry.

22:42.290 --> 22:43.380
Um...

22:43.580 --> 22:45.030
[loud thumping]

22:46.820 --> 22:48.610
Everybody, shut the fuck up!

22:56.620 --> 22:59.250
This isn't a little
hangout, okay?

23:00.580 --> 23:03.700
Oh, it's not a sleepover,
playtime.

23:03.890 --> 23:08.170
There are serious rules
that we need
to establish, 'kay?

23:09.970 --> 23:11.050
First...

23:12.390 --> 23:13.390
listen.

23:13.890 --> 23:14.890
Second,

23:15.970 --> 23:18.640
be on time.

23:19.690 --> 23:21.210
Yeah.

23:21.410 --> 23:23.020
Except for you.
You come whenever you want.

23:24.690 --> 23:26.130
What time is it?

23:26.330 --> 23:27.930
- [Annie] 3:30.
- 3:30!

23:28.130 --> 23:30.610
Club starts at 3:15.

23:31.860 --> 23:33.200
Not 3:16.

23:34.160 --> 23:36.810
[scoffs] Not 3:17,

23:37.010 --> 23:41.360
but the doors close at 3:15.

23:41.560 --> 23:43.170
No exceptions.

23:44.170 --> 23:45.820
I don't care if you're like...

23:46.020 --> 23:48.660
- [door opens]
- "Oh, but I had to go
to extra help for math

23:48.860 --> 23:52.450
because I... I need
to get a full ride

23:52.650 --> 23:54.000
because my mom
lives in a trailer

23:54.200 --> 23:56.250
and she loves her boyfriend
more than me."

23:56.450 --> 23:58.420
La, la, la. Blah, blah, blah.

23:58.620 --> 24:00.040
Shut up, okay?

24:00.240 --> 24:03.690
My dad left me,
and I'm incredibly punctual.

24:10.570 --> 24:12.600
Um, hey, guys. Come on in.

24:12.800 --> 24:13.890
Nice.

24:14.090 --> 24:15.850
[PJ] Uh, we're just getting
started here.

24:16.050 --> 24:17.540
So, um...

24:19.290 --> 24:21.230
Today I think we're gonna
start with some body contact.

24:21.430 --> 24:22.980
We're gonna do wrestling.

24:23.180 --> 24:25.280
I think I need a volunteer.

24:25.480 --> 24:27.030
Brittany, you're close to me.
You wanna...

24:27.230 --> 24:29.110
I'm sorry. I thought
we weren't allowed to be late.

24:29.310 --> 24:31.530
- That's not true. It's about...
- Oh, that's about next week.

24:31.730 --> 24:32.870
- Yeah, next week.
- So, the rules for next week.

24:33.070 --> 24:34.290
Don't be late.

24:34.490 --> 24:35.540
- But this week is good...
- [PJ] Yeah. No worries.

24:35.740 --> 24:36.790
...if you're late.
Take it easy.

24:36.990 --> 24:38.000
Okay, I'm sorry.
I just want to make sure.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.000
This is a self-defense
class, right?

24:40.200 --> 24:41.250
Where we can learn
to protect ourselves

24:41.450 --> 24:42.880
against, like,
football players.

24:43.080 --> 24:45.960
And Huntington? 'Cause, um,
they're gonna pork us.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.380
[chuckles nervously, sighs]
They're gonna pork us.

24:48.580 --> 24:50.470
I thought we were fighting
each other for money.

24:50.670 --> 24:51.890
There's a cash prize, right?

24:52.090 --> 24:53.850
[Isabel] I thought this was
to be part of, like,

24:54.050 --> 24:56.240
a local underprivileged
female community.

24:58.160 --> 25:00.060
My identity is completely
attached to hers,

25:00.260 --> 25:02.690
so I just kind of go
wherever she goes.

25:02.890 --> 25:03.860
Everyone's here
for a good reason.

25:04.060 --> 25:05.400
So, uh, you know, like...

25:05.600 --> 25:08.990
- Why are we nitpicking reasons?
- Yeah. How about this?

25:09.190 --> 25:10.990
- Let's jump in. Right?
- Yeah. For sure.

25:11.190 --> 25:12.410
- Love that.
- [PJ] Yeah.

25:12.610 --> 25:14.510
- I'll go.
- Great. Yeah.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.250
- [Annie grunts]
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. hey.

25:21.450 --> 25:22.580
I don't know about this shit.

25:22.780 --> 25:25.000
What the hell?
You didn't even warn me.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.090
Okay, we didn't get
warnings at juvie.

25:27.290 --> 25:28.510
- Look.
- [Josie] We can take it slower.

25:28.710 --> 25:29.920
- [PJ] Okay.
- Maybe, yeah, try that.

25:30.120 --> 25:31.550
Take that route.
Little slower.

25:31.750 --> 25:34.100
Look. You just use
your natural instincts,
just come at me.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.360
Whatever you want, 'kay?

25:36.490 --> 25:37.520
- [PJ grunts]
- Oh, fuck.

25:37.720 --> 25:38.850
- [girls gasp]
- [PJ] Okay.

25:39.050 --> 25:41.480
That's great.
I say that we go again.

25:41.680 --> 25:43.150
- Oh!
- [Annie] Ow, fuck! My back.

25:43.350 --> 25:45.230
Oh, shit.
Man, we gotta shut this down.

25:45.430 --> 25:46.820
We don't have to shut it down.
She's fine.

25:47.020 --> 25:48.440
- Are you fine? Are you okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.360
- She's totally fine.
- Shut this shit down.

25:50.560 --> 25:52.360
- [Josie] No, wait, Mr. G.
- Shut this shit down.

25:52.560 --> 25:53.780
No, don't blow the whistle.
Don't blow the whistle.

25:53.980 --> 25:55.700
I know that,

25:55.900 --> 25:58.580
you know, this is
a little messy right now

25:58.780 --> 26:00.620
but, like, the only way

26:00.820 --> 26:04.060
that we can learn
how to defend ourselves
is by teaching each other.

26:05.690 --> 26:07.380
Huntington is coming.

26:07.580 --> 26:09.090
[inspirational music playing]

26:09.290 --> 26:10.310

26:11.860 --> 26:14.800
I know that things
might seem scary,

26:15.000 --> 26:17.030
but that's okay, because...

26:19.070 --> 26:20.060
because...

26:20.260 --> 26:23.140
Because you're gonna
be fucking pros.

26:23.340 --> 26:24.810
- Is what I was gonna say. Yes.
- Yeah.

26:25.010 --> 26:26.230
- Right?
- [Josie] Yes.

26:26.430 --> 26:28.480
Crystal, I'm thinking of you.

26:28.680 --> 26:31.440
You are never gonna
get assaulted
on your birthday again.

26:31.640 --> 26:33.200
- Lucky number seven, okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

26:33.400 --> 26:36.740
And I... I'm gonna finally
reverse-stalk my stalker.

26:36.940 --> 26:38.330
Yeah, absolutely.

26:38.530 --> 26:39.490
[Sylvie] And for me,

26:39.690 --> 26:41.390
I'll be able
to kill my stepdad.

26:42.760 --> 26:43.790
- Awesome.
- Okay.

26:43.990 --> 26:45.120
[PJ] And if you believe
in yourselves

26:45.320 --> 26:47.420
and you believe in us
and then you trust us,

30:01.690 --> 30:02.950

we can actually take on
Huntington, you guys.

I feel like people
are actually liking
more than just

30:14.200 --> 30:16.040
the hitting and the tackling
part of the club.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.420
Yeah, I know.
We're empowering them. Duh.

30:18.620 --> 30:21.340
No, I mean, seriously,
to have a safe space
like this,

30:21.540 --> 30:22.930
it means a lot to people,

30:23.130 --> 30:25.390
and I think that if we took
some time to spend a meeting

30:25.590 --> 30:27.140
and actually get
to know these girls,

30:27.340 --> 30:29.640
like, it would be
really important,

30:29.840 --> 30:31.870
instead of just, like,
sweating on them and...

30:35.120 --> 30:39.480
Hazel, that is a genuinely
brilliant idea.

30:39.680 --> 30:41.070
- Yeah.
- I love talking
about my trauma.

30:41.270 --> 30:45.280
I literally jack off
after every single

30:45.480 --> 30:46.570
- therapy session.
- What?

30:46.770 --> 30:49.370
It just makes girls
weirdly horny. It does.

30:49.570 --> 30:50.620
- Don't say "girls." It's you.
<i>- Bonjour.</i>

30:50.820 --> 30:52.750
- [Josie groans]
- I just wanted to say

30:52.950 --> 30:55.000
I'm loving what I'm hearing
about the club.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.560
It seems so supportive
of women.

30:57.480 --> 30:58.710
Especially the hot ones.

30:58.910 --> 31:00.550
Yeah, well,
all women are hot to me.

31:00.750 --> 31:02.510
Listen, it's really cute
and everything,

31:02.710 --> 31:07.510
but we're getting
a little close to the game now
and, um...

31:07.710 --> 31:08.850
I'm just a bit concerned

31:09.050 --> 31:10.970
it might be taking away
attention from our team.

31:11.170 --> 31:15.370
I think that's, like,
literally impossible to do.

31:17.540 --> 31:18.540
Okay.

31:22.170 --> 31:24.860
[Josie] So, we know
that the club has been a place

31:25.060 --> 31:26.910
where we can feel
empowered physically,

31:27.110 --> 31:29.700
but we also thought
it could be

31:29.900 --> 31:32.370
a safe space and a place
where we can open up

31:32.570 --> 31:33.890
and talk about our feelings.

31:35.720 --> 31:37.640
Okay, so who's been raped?

31:38.730 --> 31:39.770
Just, you know,
raise your hand.

31:42.100 --> 31:43.730
Gray area stuff counts too.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.860
Everybody knows the situation
with my stepdad.

31:53.910 --> 31:58.940
He's just obsessed
with Friday movie nights.

31:59.140 --> 32:02.830
I mean, God, I get it,
you're my new stepdad, but...

32:03.630 --> 32:04.570
fuck, whatever.

32:04.770 --> 32:06.200
You know?

32:06.400 --> 32:08.530
Every time I call the police
about my stalker,

32:08.730 --> 32:10.740
they tell me to fill out
an online form.

32:10.940 --> 32:12.830
And then the form
tells me to call,

32:13.030 --> 32:16.120
so I call and then they say
they can't get involved
until he tries to kill me.

32:16.320 --> 32:17.600
And he keeps saying
he's going to...

32:18.520 --> 32:19.540
but that doesn't count.

32:19.740 --> 32:21.630
So, it's just, like, annoying.

32:21.830 --> 32:23.060
Been there.

32:24.190 --> 32:25.460
We've all been there.

32:25.660 --> 32:28.260
Well, I've been assaulted,
like, a million times,

32:28.460 --> 32:30.550
but I'm more annoyed

32:30.750 --> 32:34.850
that everyone knows me
for being beautiful
and popular

32:35.050 --> 32:37.940
and no one knows
that I'm actually smart
and super driven.

32:38.140 --> 32:41.910
Like, I literally own
a jewelry business
and no one talks about it!

32:43.620 --> 32:44.940
See?

32:45.140 --> 32:47.570
[Hazel] Well, ever since
my parents' divorce,

32:47.770 --> 32:50.530
my mom has been doing this,
like, midlife crisis.

32:50.730 --> 32:53.200
I don't know how that's really
sitting with me, you know?

32:53.400 --> 32:55.120
It's been really, really dark.

32:55.320 --> 32:57.120
This has just been really
meaningful to me to, like,

32:57.320 --> 33:01.630
get to know some new people
who actually want to,
like, get to know me.

33:01.830 --> 33:04.140
- I want to bring it back
to Brittany for one second.
- I can go next,

33:05.020 --> 33:06.230
if that's okay.

33:08.320 --> 33:12.180
I don't really like talking
about juvie

33:12.380 --> 33:15.100
and everything that happened
this summer, um...

33:15.300 --> 33:18.270
You know, obviously,
we get a lot of props
or whatever

33:18.470 --> 33:19.740
'cause people think
it's so badass.

33:20.990 --> 33:23.560
But, really wasn't.

33:23.760 --> 33:28.240
I mean, unless you consider
getting hazed horrifically
every single night,

33:28.440 --> 33:30.570
like, badass. I mean, um,

33:30.770 --> 33:33.950
obviously, you know,
we had to survive the Tributes

33:34.150 --> 33:36.040
and, you know,
I did have to, like,

33:36.230 --> 33:38.080
fight people basically
every single night.

33:38.280 --> 33:41.290
People were betting on us
and we were given, like,

33:41.490 --> 33:44.750
shivs and rusty pocket knives
and splintered wood

33:44.950 --> 33:47.090
and, um, pipes as well.

33:47.290 --> 33:50.300
And, um, we had to just,
like, fight people,
sometimes to the death.

33:50.500 --> 33:52.130
Um, and I still hear
their screams at night,

33:52.330 --> 33:55.490
um, and that guilt
probably will, like,
always shackle me forever.

33:57.280 --> 34:00.600
I realize now, I don't have
to be that person anymore.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.440
Like, I don't have
to just let things

34:03.640 --> 34:07.020
happen to me
'cause of you guys.

34:07.220 --> 34:10.030
And, um, I am,
like, really grateful

34:10.230 --> 34:12.610
for what the club
has become and...

34:12.810 --> 34:14.320
Um...

34:14.520 --> 34:16.930
Just especially, you know,
from where we started
and, uh...

34:18.800 --> 34:20.000
Yeah, sorry.

34:20.200 --> 34:21.620
[chuckles] I feel like
I kinda killed the vibe.

34:21.820 --> 34:22.870
I've never really,

34:23.070 --> 34:26.290
I guess, said that
to anyone before. Sorry.

34:26.490 --> 34:28.050
People wanna, like,
wrap up maybe or...

34:28.250 --> 34:29.560
I'm going through a divorce.

34:30.940 --> 34:33.680
Whoo! That shit felt
good to say.

34:33.880 --> 34:35.180
Ooh, I'll tell y'all,

34:35.380 --> 34:37.320
men... men need therapy.

34:38.240 --> 34:39.930
[softly] Yeah.

34:40.130 --> 34:42.870
[in normal voice]
I think that's a good place
to maybe wrap up.

34:53.340 --> 34:54.340
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:55.210 --> 34:56.220
Um...

34:57.550 --> 34:59.010
Thank you, um, for that.

35:01.430 --> 35:02.430
Um...

35:04.140 --> 35:07.040
I don't know
what you're doing tomorrow,

35:07.240 --> 35:11.420
but I was going to study
for Mr. G's women murdered
in history test,

35:11.620 --> 35:13.820
if you wanna...

35:17.320 --> 35:18.360
Yeah.

35:19.400 --> 35:20.660
Yeah, okay, sure.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.390
[man and woman
moaning in pleasure]

35:24.590 --> 35:25.540
Mom?

35:28.540 --> 35:29.670
[woman giggles]

35:30.830 --> 35:32.280
[man groans]

35:32.480 --> 35:33.630
Mom?

35:37.670 --> 35:39.030
Oh, hi, honey.

35:39.230 --> 35:40.720
What are you doing home
so early?

35:43.050 --> 35:45.460
[grunts, groans]

35:45.660 --> 35:46.600
Uh...

35:47.350 --> 35:48.480
Are you kidding me?

35:49.480 --> 35:52.150
I had a long day. [chuckles]

35:53.650 --> 35:55.190
[Jeff] Mrs. Callahan,
can I have a snack?

35:57.780 --> 35:59.220
[Stella-Rebecca]
First club fundraiser.

35:59.420 --> 36:01.890
I'm so excited.
Great turnout, right?

36:02.090 --> 36:04.310
Hello, ladies.

36:04.510 --> 36:05.810
[Stella-Rebecca]
Hi, Bill, Bob, Fred...

36:06.010 --> 36:07.940
I don't know why anyone
wants my old, dirty underwear.

36:08.140 --> 36:09.560
It's so weird. [chuckles]

36:09.760 --> 36:12.150
Hey, Britt, uh, don't let 'em
touch in between your toes.

36:12.350 --> 36:13.400
Thanks, PJ.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.110
- [Hazel groaning]
- Ah. We're havin' fun.

36:15.310 --> 36:16.700
We're selling panties.

36:16.900 --> 36:19.090
You know, Brittany said she'd
make me a custom bracelet.

36:20.800 --> 36:21.740
Very nice.

36:21.940 --> 36:23.120
[PJ] Do you wanna,
um, celebrate?

36:23.320 --> 36:24.930
We could get some chicken
on a stick tonight.

36:25.970 --> 36:28.970
Um, I can't. Uh...

36:30.230 --> 36:32.670
Isabel and I have plans, so...

36:32.870 --> 36:33.960
[Hazel continues groaning]

36:34.160 --> 36:35.880
You're hanging out
with Isabel?

36:36.080 --> 36:37.130
Yep.

36:37.330 --> 36:39.390
[PJ] Fuck, you're fast.
Oh, my God, okay.

36:39.580 --> 36:41.220
I have to keep up.

36:41.420 --> 36:42.560
Hazel, what is wrong?

36:42.750 --> 36:43.930
Are you constipated
or something?

36:44.130 --> 36:45.270
[Hazel] I'm fucking tired.

36:45.470 --> 36:47.600
My mom was up all night
fucking the meathead.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.560
What meathead?
Hi. Underwear, cars.

36:49.760 --> 36:50.980
- Thanks.
- You know, like, the guy.

36:51.180 --> 36:52.540
He's like the crybaby.

36:54.790 --> 36:55.900
With the balls?

36:56.100 --> 36:58.300
He catches them
and he... he throws them?

37:00.090 --> 37:02.050
He's like the main guy.

37:03.220 --> 37:04.220
[sputters] Jeff?

37:05.260 --> 37:06.410
Is your mom hooking up
with Jeff?

37:06.610 --> 37:09.000
I just thought Jeff might be
her safe word.

37:09.200 --> 37:10.670
Jeff is his name, you idiot.

37:10.870 --> 37:12.790
Just get the hot people
confused, Jesus.

37:12.990 --> 37:14.300
[Stella-Rebecca yelps]

37:14.490 --> 37:15.460
I'm good. [chuckles]

37:15.660 --> 37:17.170
[PJ] Looking good, Stella!

37:17.370 --> 37:18.470
[Isabel laughs]

37:18.670 --> 37:19.610
[PJ] Are you gonna tell her?

37:22.690 --> 37:24.970
[Tim] Yeah, they said
they were in juvie this summer.

37:25.170 --> 37:27.370
Okay, are you sure
they're not in the system?

37:29.530 --> 37:31.520
But isn't every kid from
Rockbridge Falls sent there?

37:31.720 --> 37:32.660
[player] Hit me! Ow!

37:34.460 --> 37:36.380
Okay, yeah, Essex County.
Any others?

37:38.590 --> 37:39.610
Got it. Thank you.

37:39.810 --> 37:41.380
- [players shouting]
- [sighs]

37:45.010 --> 37:46.130
[whistle blows]

37:47.180 --> 37:48.200
Jeff!

37:48.400 --> 37:51.140
[easygoing music playing]

37:52.560 --> 37:54.000
[Josie laughing]

37:54.200 --> 37:57.550
No, yeah, but I thought
she was maybe dead.

37:57.750 --> 37:59.260
- Not good.
- That's not the best.

37:59.460 --> 38:02.340
- No. No, not great.
- That's not a great thing.

38:02.540 --> 38:03.940
[Josie and Isabel laughing]

38:08.240 --> 38:09.730
I wanted to...

38:09.920 --> 38:12.390
I wanted to tell you
that, um, I'm...

38:12.590 --> 38:14.330
I'm very glad
that I joined the club.

38:15.830 --> 38:16.830
Me too.

38:18.750 --> 38:21.150
I think it's really impressive

38:21.350 --> 38:24.370
that you and PJ went through
everything that you did

38:24.560 --> 38:27.830
and now have decided
to help the rest of us.

38:28.030 --> 38:30.300
I mean even that story
you told the other day.

38:31.560 --> 38:33.540
You're really, really brave.

38:33.740 --> 38:34.960
No. [chuckles]

38:35.160 --> 38:36.380
No. No, no.

38:36.580 --> 38:39.710
Yes. I mean you almost
killed a girl. [chuckles]

38:39.910 --> 38:40.860
You're...

38:41.980 --> 38:42.980
Yeah, you're...

38:44.190 --> 38:45.570
really, really brave.

38:49.070 --> 38:50.070
What?

38:55.120 --> 38:56.710
Actually, Isabel, uh...

38:58.040 --> 38:59.650
- There's, um...
- Yeah?

38:59.850 --> 39:02.190
There's something
you maybe should know.

39:02.390 --> 39:03.500
Uh...

39:05.380 --> 39:07.660
I mean it's pretty insane.

39:07.860 --> 39:09.550
Okay. [chuckles]
What... what is it?

39:11.550 --> 39:12.550
I just, I...

39:15.970 --> 39:17.460
I heard Jeff
is cheating on you.

39:17.660 --> 39:18.600
- [music stops]
- [glasses clinking]

39:21.770 --> 39:23.730
Wait... [laughing]

39:26.990 --> 39:28.100
Wait, what? [chuckles]

39:28.290 --> 39:31.390
I... I... Sorry, I think I...
I heard...

39:31.590 --> 39:36.480
Um, what? Um...
Who... who told you that?

39:36.680 --> 39:41.360
Hazel told me that, uh,
he and Mrs. Callahan

39:41.560 --> 39:45.070
are at it, pretty much,
like, every night,

39:45.270 --> 39:47.950
- like, constantly.
- [Josie and Isabel laughing]

39:48.150 --> 39:52.080
I mean, just at it
with each other,
which is pretty fucked up.

39:52.280 --> 39:55.160
Um, even though I guess
it's, technically, it's legal,

39:55.360 --> 39:57.170
it's still just
pretty nasty, uh...

39:57.370 --> 39:58.790
[cries] Oh.

39:58.990 --> 40:00.390
[sobbing]

40:09.780 --> 40:11.140
Thanks.

40:13.090 --> 40:16.100

Jeff so hungy.
Hungy hungy, hungy.

40:16.300 --> 40:17.730
Jeff so hungy.

[in normal voice] Swoosh!

[smacks lips, sniffs]

40:22.790 --> 40:23.940
[grunts]

40:24.140 --> 40:25.360
What the fuck is this?

40:25.560 --> 40:26.500
Is there pineapple in this?

40:27.340 --> 40:28.820
We talked about this, Janice.

40:29.020 --> 40:30.130
Jeffrey's allergic
to pineapple.

40:33.550 --> 40:34.550
Eat a bag of dicks.

40:38.350 --> 40:39.830
[sighs]

40:40.030 --> 40:41.940
Well, I wasn't going to do it,
but this is the last straw.

40:46.650 --> 40:47.690
How was last night?

40:53.490 --> 40:56.850
Uh, bad, probably,
I would say.

40:57.050 --> 40:58.020
Wait, really?

40:58.220 --> 41:00.120
[dramatic electronic
music playing]

41:03.080 --> 41:05.040
She's walking really fast.

41:05.920 --> 41:07.320
[Isabel breathing heavily]

41:07.520 --> 41:08.880
She usually walks
a lot slower.

41:11.510 --> 41:13.660
Hi.

41:13.860 --> 41:15.180
Are you having sex
with Mrs. Callahan?

41:17.720 --> 41:20.370
Baby, you look so beautiful.

41:20.570 --> 41:22.540
Like, so fucking hot.
How... how are you?

41:22.740 --> 41:24.920
Bad. Are you having sex
with her?

41:25.120 --> 41:26.610
[sputters] I'm... I'm...

41:27.940 --> 41:29.590
helping her with her taxes.

41:29.790 --> 41:31.090
Aren't you
in eighth grade algebra?

41:31.290 --> 41:33.050
[chuckles] I can't answer
that question

41:33.250 --> 41:34.430
because I... I don't know
how to read.

41:34.630 --> 41:35.720
She's asking you to your face!

41:35.920 --> 41:37.270
Fuck, that usually works.

41:37.470 --> 41:40.100
[sighs] Are you cheating
on me again?

41:40.300 --> 41:43.310
Baby, no! No!

41:43.510 --> 41:44.690
No, why would...
why would I do--

41:44.890 --> 41:47.320
That was one time
with your sister, just once,

41:47.520 --> 41:48.610
two, four times.

41:48.810 --> 41:51.530
No, I would never cheat
on you again, okay?

41:51.730 --> 41:54.620
I promise you
I am not sleeping with her.

41:54.820 --> 41:56.120
I literally saw you yesterday.

41:56.320 --> 41:57.740
Shut up, nerd!
I fucked your mom!

41:57.940 --> 41:59.850
- [Tim groans]
- [Isabel] Mmm. Mmm.

42:00.760 --> 42:01.870
Wait.

42:02.070 --> 42:04.670
- [chuckles] Yeah, we're done.
- Isabel...

42:04.870 --> 42:06.770
[dramatic electronic
music playing]

42:08.440 --> 42:10.090
I'm getting revenge.

42:10.290 --> 42:11.840
I'm gonna fuck up
some football players.
And I'm buyin' a gun.

42:12.040 --> 42:13.680
Hell yeah.
I'll get my stepdad's.

42:13.880 --> 42:15.140
What about, like, egging?

42:15.340 --> 42:16.510
Yeah, so we can make 'em
not refrigerated and smelly?

42:16.710 --> 42:17.720
Ooh, we could cook 'em
and be like...

42:17.920 --> 42:19.060
- "You're cooked."
- Yes. Yeah.

42:19.260 --> 42:20.200
Or what about, like, a bomb?

42:22.700 --> 42:24.940
Like a...
like a super small bomb.

42:25.140 --> 42:26.440
I mean, they're super easy
to make,

42:26.640 --> 42:28.150
and I can just put it
under his car,

42:28.350 --> 42:29.380
and it can be a distraction.

42:31.170 --> 42:33.880
Yeah, Hazel,
let's do terrorism.

you can't just throw it.

with it.

watch me. Just...

We're really gonna
scare them off.

Okay, well,
don't get distracted,

43:53.390 --> 43:56.050
'cause we could be fined,
like, $2 for this, so...

43:59.590 --> 44:01.010
Thought you might want
some company.

44:03.180 --> 44:04.850
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

44:07.850 --> 44:09.520
It's nice everybody's here,

44:10.560 --> 44:11.560

44:12.440 --> 44:13.440

It is nice.

44:19.820 --> 44:20.900

this before, but...

44:43.930 --> 44:46.040

you fighting

44:46.240 --> 44:48.850
and speaking loudly
at my boyfriend.

44:49.770 --> 44:51.130
I really value

44:51.330 --> 44:53.980
when people use violence
and raise their voices for me.

44:56.020 --> 44:58.020
It's actually one
of my love languages.

44:59.320 --> 45:01.150
- Is the other one gifts?
- The other one is gifts.

45:02.400 --> 45:04.010
Um, I know

45:04.210 --> 45:06.780

Listen guys.
It doesn't matter...

01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:03.930
the reason that we started
this, right? Like...

01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:06.250
The point of the club

01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:10.170
is that we all learn
from each other, right?

01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:13.300
And... and we had a great time
doing it and...

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:14.670
I thought this club
was for sisterhood,

01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:17.130
but it was for your own
selfish interests?

01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:18.900

all over again.

01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:26.270

I didn't want to.

01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:29.960
I would never want to do this.

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:35.130

You're pathetic, Josie.

01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:48.250
[PJ] Mr. G,
we're really sorry, we...

01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:49.500
All right, look.

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.880
You know what?
I'm not a fuckin' idiot.

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.170
I just look like this.

01:00:53.370 --> 01:00:55.420
I wasn't doin' this shit
as a distraction.

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:58.340
I actually was doin' this shit
'cause I actually liked
y'all group

01:00:58.540 --> 01:00:59.590
and what y'all stood for.

01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:02.260
- Wait, we can explain.
- I trusted you two

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:04.600
and y'all exploited
my solidarity.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:07.440
I played the role
of an amazin' ally.

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:08.810
Is this about the time I said

01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:10.950
Amelia Earhart
was a fake hero?

01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:13.360
Because it's true.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.610
Many a guy fly planes
without crashing,

01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:17.800
but you never hear about them.

01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:20.030
And then it's like,

01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:22.410
[in high-pitched voice]
"Oh, it's so hard
to be a girl."

01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:24.080
"We, like, make less money."

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.120
"We had to lose
our last names."

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.580
"I love you."

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:29.540
"I want to be with you
for the rest of our lives."

backsplash in the kitchen."

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:36.340
you leave me
for a motherfucker named Tony

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:39.220
and suddenly,
the fucking kitchen
is lime green.

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:40.680
I think...

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.180
Yeah, I think that moved
away from us.

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:45.680
Oh, you look confused,
like how I'm confused
right now,

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:48.430

a fucking fight club
to get some cooch.

And for what? Y'all ain't even
know how to work that thing.

01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:53.650
And I know y'all ain't
tickling the pearl,

01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:54.900

to be talking to us like that.

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:04.330
Man, I knew women were evil.

tellin' me like,
"No, that's not true."

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:24.570
Okay, well, you were pretty
horrible to her yesterday.

01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:30.430
I'm sorry, what?
This is... this is my fault?

01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:33.770
I'm not the one who put Isabel
on a rampage.

01:02:33.970 --> 01:02:36.070
Sorry, what does that have
to do with anything?

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.610
If Isabel wasn't so desperate
to get revenge,

01:02:38.810 --> 01:02:40.320
then we wouldn't have
blown up Jeff's car

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.110
and then he wouldn't be
so upset

01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:44.450
and then whatever the fuck
just happened
would not have happened.

01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:47.490
Okay, so all of the blame
just goes on me then?

01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:50.080
Like, none of this can
be traced back to you at all?

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.140
Well, I mean, yeah,
it was your idea
to start the whole club.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.840
I didn't want to do this
from the beginning.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.920
You know that.

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:02.010
I just followed your lead
like an idiot.

01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:04.840

you created that insane story

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.600
about girls betting on you
to fight other girls
with shivs.

with Isabel on my own.

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:17.770

have talked to her without me,

who didn't do anything.

Brittany's straight, so...

Do you actually like her?

01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:49.390

other than yourself?

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.130
Girl, when I was
in high school,

01:07:06.330 --> 01:07:08.800
people found out I was gay,
nobody wanted to be my friend.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.090
And back then it was worse

01:07:10.290 --> 01:07:12.970
because they hated you
just for being gay.

01:07:13.170 --> 01:07:15.090
[both] Not for being
gay and untalented.

01:07:15.290 --> 01:07:16.970
Mmm.

01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:18.850
Sorry, people didn't know
you were gay?

01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:20.950
Girl, I wore a weave
back then, okay?

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:22.810
And I used to say,

01:07:23.010 --> 01:07:24.190
[in high-pitched voice]
"Hey, girl. Hey..."

01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:25.600
[in normal voice]
Look, that's not the point.

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:26.690
You want some advice?

01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:28.570
Invest in yourself,

01:07:28.770 --> 01:07:30.360
teach people to fear you
instead of love you.

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:33.530
I don't wanna, like, deny
your advice, obviously.

01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:34.860
I just, um...

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:37.200
PJ and I are actually
in a fight right now.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.620
- So, like...
- [coughing]

01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:40.370
Like, that's the advice
that I need.

01:07:40.570 --> 01:07:43.580
I never had many friends,
and that's... that's sad.

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:46.000
And as I've gotten old
in this world,

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.810
it's just gotten more sad.

01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:51.630
Okay, um...

01:07:51.830 --> 01:07:53.510
I think I'm just gonna go
to the game

01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:55.510
and then work it out
with PJ there.

01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:56.680
I wouldn't do that.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:57.850
Why not?

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.890
- It's with Huntington, right?
- Yeah.

01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:03.020
Well, I'm guessing
they've been fucking people up
for the past month, right?

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:05.600
- Yeah.
- So, they're violent.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.060
What do you think's
gonna happen tonight?

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.040
I don't know. Football?

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.110
- Game? Tackle?

01:08:12.310 --> 01:08:13.340
Oh, girl.

01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:16.910
There is a 50-year rivalry
going on.

01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:19.010
They always fuck up
some unlucky player.

01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:21.870
How you don't know--

01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:24.710
In '77, they burned him
at a stake with his dog.

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:27.880
In '92, they drowned him
in a giant kiddie pool.

01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:31.000
And in '03, they pulled
his body apart with horses.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.380
It's called quartering.

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:33.920
I know... I know
what it's called.

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.050
So, tonight,
I'm stayin' inside

01:08:36.250 --> 01:08:37.590

this Huntington shit's
way darker than we thought.

Apparently,

plays Rockbridge,

they try to kill a player
