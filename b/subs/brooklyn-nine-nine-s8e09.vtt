07:33.786 --> 07:35.913
we absolutely have to win
the first leg of the heist.

07:35.997 --> 07:36.956
It doubles our chances.

07:37.039 --> 07:38.374
Got it, so basically

07:38.458 --> 07:40.042
we just have to keep Holt
from getting that tube.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.170
Yes, indeed.

07:43.838 --> 07:44.881
I just realized we haven't
been alone without Mac

07:44.964 --> 07:46.382
-for like three months.
-Desk?

07:46.466 --> 07:47.550
-Yep, let's do it.
-All right.

07:47.925 --> 07:50.011
Enough talk.
I'm getting that tube.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.762
-Where'd it go?
-That tube has been

07:51.846 --> 07:54.765
whisked off to a secret
location which only I know.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.059
And since I'm not competing,
I've agreed to help out.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.936
I designed the first part
of the heist

07:59.020 --> 08:01.564
to be a scavenger hunt
through memorable moments

08:01.647 --> 08:02.857
from the last eight years.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.442
It's a trip down memory lane.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.069
Not a problem.
I have the memory of a--

08:07.153 --> 08:09.530
the thing with
the big nose and ears.

08:09.614 --> 08:10.865
-Prince Charles.
-No.

08:10.948 --> 08:12.742
I hid five clues,
each leading to the next.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.619
And the last one
gets you the tube.

08:14.702 --> 08:17.413
The first clue
is under your chairs.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.415
"Our fallen colleague
missing still…"

08:19.499 --> 08:21.501
"His replacement
fits the bill…"

08:21.584 --> 08:23.044
I can think of one colleague
who literally fell.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.378
We all watched it happen

08:24.462 --> 08:26.005
and then we ate
his sweet candy insides.

08:26.088 --> 08:27.548
The vending machine!

08:27.632 --> 08:29.342
Is one theory,
probably incorrect.

08:29.425 --> 08:31.302
Damn it, Charles.
Silent epiphany!

08:31.385 --> 08:33.471
It's a new machine.
It's beautiful!

08:33.554 --> 08:35.348
"His replacement
fits the bill."

08:35.431 --> 08:37.642
The slots aren't labeled.
How do we know what to press?

08:37.725 --> 08:39.685
Well, a vending machine code
is usually a letter followed

08:39.769 --> 08:41.812
by a double-digit number.
Jeffords is being sentimental.

08:41.896 --> 08:44.190
[screams]
[glass shatters]

08:44.273 --> 08:45.525
-Holy [bleep].
-Got it.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.151
For the record,
it was gonna be B-nine-nine.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.110
Nobody cares.
My thing was better.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.278
"When a fellow needs a friend,

08:49.362 --> 08:51.239
it's what's on the inside
that counts."

08:51.322 --> 08:53.699
"Fellow needs,"
like felonies.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.743
"On the inside," like jail.

08:55.826 --> 08:58.371
-Your cannibal friend.
-Charles, I highly doubt--

08:58.454 --> 08:59.997
-it's definitely that!
-Go!

09:00.081 --> 09:02.166
For the record,
I'm not a cannibal anymore.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.627
My new passion
is needlepoint embroidery.

09:04.710 --> 09:05.962
Look at these.

09:06.045 --> 09:09.131
Two parrots in love.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.801
A turtle with a monocle
and a top hat.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.011
Wow, it's so intricate.
How do you--

09:14.095 --> 09:15.972
-Ahh!
-Oh, no, no!

09:16.055 --> 09:17.431
Okay, you got me.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.558
I was gonna eat you.

09:18.641 --> 09:19.809
That's still my thing.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.519
It's even affected
my needlepoint.

09:21.602 --> 09:24.355
Look at this. Liver.

09:24.438 --> 09:26.315
A heart.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.526
Butt.

09:28.609 --> 09:29.777
An arm.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.070
Mmm.

09:31.153 --> 09:32.071
Oh, and there's this one

09:32.154 --> 09:34.907
that your delicious-looking
lieutenant asked me to do.

09:35.491 --> 09:36.450
The third clue.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.869
"Where the devil lies,
you'll find your prize."

09:38.953 --> 09:40.413
Well…
[chuckles]

09:40.496 --> 09:42.039
I know where the devil lies.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.041
-Wuntch's grave.
-Wow.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.668
Did Terry put up
a balloon arch

09:45.751 --> 09:47.169
-just for the heist?
-No, that was me.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.629
I come every week
to install a fresh one.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.339
But enough chit-chat.
Let's dig her up.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.632
I don't think
we wanna do that.

09:51.716 --> 09:52.842
Why, are you scared
of what she'd look like?

09:52.925 --> 09:54.844
She's just a corpse
with worms for eyes,

09:54.927 --> 09:56.053
no different
than when she was alive.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.264
Found it. Here.

09:58.347 --> 10:00.766
"Don't tell me where the next
clue is hidden, tell me why."

10:00.850 --> 10:02.143
"Tell me why."

10:02.226 --> 10:03.853
From that time Jake made
the perp sing that song.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.021
Wait a minute,
you guys know about that?

10:05.104 --> 10:06.230
Were any of you actually there?

10:06.314 --> 10:07.898
You've told us the story
many times.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.151
And tried to recreate the
moment on several occasions.

10:10.234 --> 10:12.653

10:12.737 --> 10:15.323
No, number two and five,
you're off key.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.158
Number three, you're coming in
way too early.

10:17.241 --> 10:19.285
I mean, what are we even
doing here, guys?

10:19.368 --> 10:20.911
So which one do you think
killed your family?

10:20.995 --> 10:22.496
Yeah, I got to stop
trying to recapture

10:22.580 --> 10:24.123
the magic of the original
and move on.

10:24.206 --> 10:26.083
Anyways, back to
the eighth annual heist.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.879
Oh, no! Janitor Dan

[all] No!

10:31.797 --> 10:33.299
Stop! Stop!

10:33.382 --> 10:35.176
-You're welcome.
-Damn it.

10:35.259 --> 10:36.969
I love that guy, he's so nice.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.721
Ruined the whole heist and
we can't even be mad at him.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.348
-Yeah, we gotta call Terry.
-Already on it.

10:40.431 --> 10:41.474
It's going
straight to voicemail.

10:41.557 --> 10:42.892
No problem,
I actually installed

10:42.975 --> 10:44.685
malware on his phone
in case he started heisting.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.270
I have access to
his microphone and speaker.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.564
So, Lieutenant Jeffords,
can you handle

10:48.648 --> 10:50.816
the increased responsibility
of being a captain?

10:50.900 --> 10:53.069
I'm glad you asked.
I'm very responsible.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.488
<i>Terry! Terry!</i>

10:55.571 --> 10:57.573
<i>Terry, it's Jake and the squad</i>

10:57.657 --> 10:59.367
Terry, Terry, Terry!

-I didn't hear anything.

11:02.119 --> 11:03.704

<i>Answer your butt.</i>

11:03.788 --> 11:05.831
Don't ignore your butt, Terry!

11:05.915 --> 11:07.083
<i>Terry, come on,</i>
<i>it'll just take a second.</i>

11:07.166 --> 11:08.250
<i>We just need the final clue.</i>

11:08.334 --> 11:10.336
A perfect world,
a time of bliss,

11:10.419 --> 11:12.421
-a loving and inspiring kiss.
-We can't hear you.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.298
Please speak directly
into your butt.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.716
A perfect world,

11:15.800 --> 11:18.135
a time of bliss,
a loving and inspiring kiss.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.596
Wonderful!
Thank you, Terry, that is all.

11:20.679 --> 11:21.806
"A loving
and inspiring kiss."

11:21.889 --> 11:23.140
That's gotta be Jake and Amy.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.934
And we know it's not
the last couple years

11:25.017 --> 11:26.644
because they've basically
stopped kissing in front of us.

11:26.727 --> 11:28.938
All right. Wait a minute!

11:29.021 --> 11:30.606
"A Perfect World" is a movie
with Kevin Costner,

11:30.689 --> 11:32.608
or should I say Kevin Cozner.

11:32.691 --> 11:33.984
It's a kiss between
Holt and Kevin.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.236
The one that
brought them back together.

11:35.319 --> 11:37.196
-Out front in the rain!
-Ooh!

11:37.279 --> 11:38.697
Well, looks like
it's gonna be

11:38.781 --> 11:40.491
-a sprint out of the elevator.
-This is unfortunate.

11:40.574 --> 11:41.742
I didn't want to have
to reveal it this early.

11:41.826 --> 11:42.743
Reveal what this early?

11:42.827 --> 11:44.412
My most precious secret.

11:44.495 --> 11:46.539
My tattoo!

11:46.622 --> 11:49.625
[gasps]
What am I looking at?

11:49.708 --> 11:51.168
Is that what I think it is?

11:51.252 --> 11:54.296
Kevin's human head
on Cheddar's dog body?

11:54.380 --> 11:56.215
I asked for a tattoo
of Kevin and Cheddar.

11:56.298 --> 11:57.675
I don't know why
he combined them.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.844
It's--it's--

11:59.927 --> 12:01.387
It's the ultimate
distraction.

12:01.470 --> 12:02.638
No, wait, wait!

12:02.721 --> 12:04.473
Sorry, but you're too late.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.808
The tube is mine.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.852
Wait, it's empty.
Where'd it go?

12:07.935 --> 12:11.021
You looking for this?

12:11.105 --> 12:12.356
Surprise reveal.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.357
[all] Gina?

12:13.441 --> 12:15.568
[evil laughter]

12:18.904 --> 12:20.698
Well, well, well.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.908
You thought you could have
a final heist without me?

12:22.992 --> 12:24.702
I texted you about it
like 50 times.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.078
Yeah, but, Jake,
I'm important now.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.621
So if you want to reach me,
you should call into

12:27.705 --> 12:28.873
"Watch What Happens Live."

12:28.956 --> 12:30.624
Andy Cohen always
knows where I am, okay?

12:30.708 --> 12:32.668
Anyhoo,
I'm gonna keep this safe

12:32.751 --> 12:35.171
by driving it around
in this hot little mama.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.464
You rented an armored truck?

12:36.547 --> 12:37.715
No, I bought it.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.425
It felt like it was great
for the heist

12:39.508 --> 12:41.093
and it's also just
such a wonderful way

12:41.177 --> 12:42.803
to flex on you guys
how rich I am now.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.139
I'm all about Salmons.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.390
Salmon.
You don't know about

12:46.474 --> 12:47.892
the $10,000 bill
that has a picture

12:47.975 --> 12:49.810
of Salmon P. Chase on it?
He's like--

12:49.894 --> 12:51.228
It's sad you were
unaware of that.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.688
Oh, my gosh,
this is embarrassing

12:52.771 --> 12:54.523
for all you broke bums.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.192
Okay.

12:56.275 --> 12:59.111
You're gonna regret
the day you fired me.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.696
You left of
your own volition!

13:00.779 --> 13:02.406
We each spent
meaningful time with you!

13:02.490 --> 13:05.534
We were incredibly supportive!

13:05.618 --> 13:06.869
Thank you for considering me.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.829
Again, I'm sorry about
that interruption.

13:08.913 --> 13:11.207
-I know the heist seems crazy.
-No, no, no.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.042
In a difficult job,
it's vital to give people

13:13.125 --> 13:14.752
a chance to blow off
some steam.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.337
-That's just good leadership.
-Wow!

13:16.420 --> 13:17.838
I was sure you'd be angry.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.591
I figured this interview
was over.

13:20.674 --> 13:22.301
What?

13:22.384 --> 13:23.636
There's a price tag
on this chair.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.304
Oh, well, I must have
forgotten to take it off.

13:25.387 --> 13:26.764
It's a recent purchase.

13:26.847 --> 13:28.641
You should know, Jeffords,
I want to keep you here.

13:28.724 --> 13:30.935
You want to keep me here?

13:31.018 --> 13:32.770
Yes, at the NYPD.

13:32.853 --> 13:34.647
Hmm.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.567
Wait a minute.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.110
There's no light bulb
in this lamp.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.073
This computer
isn't even plugged in.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.200
And there is no light

13:46.283 --> 13:47.993
coming from this window.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.870
Son of a bitch!

13:49.954 --> 13:51.413
This is a fake office.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.082
It's all part of the heist!

13:53.165 --> 13:54.625
<i>Oh, Jake,</i>
<i>what do we do now?</i>

13:54.708 --> 13:56.502
Obviously, our plans
have changed a little,

13:56.585 --> 13:58.045
but the perfect goodbye
is still in our sights.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.296
Our objective is the same.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.006
Get that tube from Gina
before Holt does.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.883
How do we break into
an armored truck?

14:04.510 --> 14:06.178
-What are you two doing?
-Oh, sorry,

14:06.262 --> 14:07.846
Mac's done with daycare
so we had the babysitter

14:07.930 --> 14:09.348
bring him by
so we could say hi.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.141
'Cause we're gonna be home
late tonight, so--

14:11.225 --> 14:13.936
Yeah, just trying to strike
that heist-life balance.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.771
Isn't that right,
little Mac-a-docious?

14:15.854 --> 14:17.398
-Isn't that right, Mac-a-roonie?
-Yeah.

14:17.481 --> 14:18.941
-Ugh.
-Yeah!

14:19.024 --> 14:20.150
Well, when you're done,
come find me.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.278
-We gotta talk strategy.
-Got it.

14:22.361 --> 14:23.696
I can't believe
she fell for it.

14:23.779 --> 14:25.155
So, I don't understand,

14:25.239 --> 14:26.991
you guys are paying me
to babysit a fake baby?

14:27.074 --> 14:28.701
Yeah, we're just hoping
people think it's real.

14:28.784 --> 14:29.952
Oh, cool.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.412
-You think it's working?
-I do not.

14:31.495 --> 14:34.290
Okay, so this truck
is a fortress on wheels

14:34.373 --> 14:36.542
and we are not getting in there
without an intricate plan.

14:36.625 --> 14:39.253
I was just gonna jump on it
as it drives by.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.838
-Yeah, okay.
-Dope.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.340
