WEBVTT

00:20.311 --> 00:22.603
Tina, this is not
"on the way home from school."

00:22.604 --> 00:24.105
I've never seen
this street before.

00:24.106 --> 00:25.940
Are we
on Stranger Danger Avenue?

00:25.941 --> 00:27.900
We're almost there.
I promise. I think.

00:27.901 --> 00:30.319
Ugh. Still can't believe
I wasn't invited.

00:30.320 --> 00:31.821
- Invited to what?
- Julian's having

00:31.822 --> 00:34.157
a casual pre-Halloween gathering

00:34.158 --> 00:36.284
to play video games
and eat candy corn

00:36.285 --> 00:37.910
and it's not
technically a party,

00:37.911 --> 00:40.329
but I'm gathering that they
don't want me to be there.

00:40.330 --> 00:41.748
What is it, do I have BO?

00:41.749 --> 00:44.167
- Or NTCUO?
- What's that again?

00:44.168 --> 00:45.835
Not Totally Clean
Underwear Odor.

00:45.836 --> 00:48.129
- It's funky, but fun.
- Gene--

00:48.130 --> 00:50.840
I had to help Alex feel better,
for blabbing it to me.

00:50.841 --> 00:52.592
See you at Julian's gathering.

00:52.593 --> 00:54.635
- What? When?
- Oh...

00:54.636 --> 00:56.846
- Is Julian having a gathering?
- Oh...

00:56.847 --> 01:00.516
Yeah, but, Gene,
I feel terrible.

01:00.517 --> 01:02.393
You know what? If you're
not going, then I'm not going.

01:02.394 --> 01:04.270
Uh, no.
You don't have to do that.

01:04.271 --> 01:05.605
I-- I don't care.

01:05.606 --> 01:06.814
- You should definitely--
- Oh, thank God.

01:06.815 --> 01:08.024
'Cause I really want to go.

01:08.025 --> 01:09.108
Ugh...

01:09.109 --> 01:11.196
- Gene, I--
- Yes. This is it.

01:11.321 --> 01:14.072
Nothing? We come all this way
and you don't buy anything?

01:14.073 --> 01:15.782
Their barrettes weren't
knifey-looking enough.

01:15.783 --> 01:17.492
This is so you can wear them
on your fingers

01:17.493 --> 01:19.160
- and be Barrette-y Krueger?
- Yes.

01:19.161 --> 01:21.621
- It is a good costume.
- But a hard-to-find barrette.

01:21.622 --> 01:23.206
Look at this.

01:23.207 --> 01:24.624
Look at their freaky
little heads.

01:24.625 --> 01:26.709
- That's our reflection.
- No, the dolls.

01:26.710 --> 01:28.586
Got to be a strange place
to work.

01:28.587 --> 01:29.962
You must feel huge.

01:29.963 --> 01:31.255
That's Miss Bisselbender.

01:31.256 --> 01:33.216
The substitute teacher?

01:33.217 --> 01:36.052
- Yeah.
- Okay... Guess we're going in.

01:36.053 --> 01:37.887
If the dolls come alive,
we'll step on one

01:37.888 --> 01:39.472
to give them something
to think about,

01:39.473 --> 01:41.516
- and then we'll run for it.
- Huh? Oh.

01:41.517 --> 01:42.892
Uh, yeah. Good plan.

01:42.893 --> 01:44.602
- Hi, Miss B.
- Oh. Hi, Gene.

01:44.603 --> 01:46.020
Is this where
you sleep at night?

01:46.021 --> 01:47.980
Were you about to shrink down
and climb in there?

01:47.981 --> 01:50.233
I can't shrink down,
but I have napped behind the counter.

01:50.234 --> 01:51.651
This is my parents' store.

01:51.652 --> 01:53.277
Well, look at you,
having parents.

01:53.278 --> 01:55.113
Look at <i>you,</i>
having an entourage.

01:55.114 --> 01:57.240
- Are they bodyguards?
- Ha. My sisters.

01:57.241 --> 01:59.325
Tina and Louise.
This is Miss Bisselbender,

01:59.326 --> 02:02.745
- The substitutioner.
- Hi. We've, uh, met, actually.

02:02.746 --> 02:05.748
Yup. Uh, nice store.
Very dolled up.

02:05.749 --> 02:07.875
Thanks. Sometimes
I open up for my folks

02:07.876 --> 02:09.585
and watch the place
when they're out of town.

02:09.586 --> 02:11.420
They're at Dollhouse
Doll Fashion Week.

02:11.421 --> 02:12.672
That's my worst nightmare.

02:12.673 --> 02:13.881
Yeah, the designers are
cutthroat.

02:13.882 --> 02:15.049
Oh, my God!

02:15.050 --> 02:16.634
- Whoa!
- Sorry. Sorry.

02:16.635 --> 02:17.718
I did that.

02:17.719 --> 02:19.303
I set it up
so I could take pictures.

02:19.304 --> 02:21.389
I do that sometimes
when I'm alone in the store.

02:21.390 --> 02:24.183
Which is pretty much 100%
of the time I'm in the store.

02:24.184 --> 02:26.561
I send pictures to my friends.
Especially this time of year.

02:26.562 --> 02:28.521
- Halloween?
- Corporate tax return deadline.

02:28.522 --> 02:29.856
- Oh.
- No, Halloween.

02:29.857 --> 02:31.524
Cool, cool, cool.
Lucky friends.

02:31.525 --> 02:33.317
Now I want a dollhouse.
More please.

02:33.318 --> 02:35.822
I don't know if I should--
Okay, just my top ten.

02:37.031 --> 02:38.531
Whoa. You're a genius?

02:38.532 --> 02:40.491
I think you and I are
the only ones who know that.

02:40.492 --> 02:44.412
Those dolls look how I felt today
when I heard about Julian's gathering.

02:44.413 --> 02:47.250
I was decapitated by sadness.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.459
Sadcapitated.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.461
So... should we get going?

02:50.587 --> 02:51.919
Yeah, I guess you're right.

02:51.920 --> 02:53.754
It's three-days' walk back
to the restaurant.

02:53.755 --> 02:55.840
Uh, yeah. Hope our supplies
don't run out.

02:55.841 --> 02:57.341
Bye, Miss Bisselbender.

02:57.342 --> 02:59.302
Maybe Ms. Twitchell will
donate her other kidney

02:59.303 --> 03:01.137
so you can come back
and sub in my homeroom again.

03:01.138 --> 03:02.346
That was fun.

03:02.347 --> 03:03.639
That <i>was</i> fun.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.349
Good job watching
all the movies I played,

03:05.350 --> 03:07.143
I mean, learning all
the stuff I taught you.

03:07.144 --> 03:08.728
Bye. Don't fall asleep here.

03:08.729 --> 03:10.646
- The dolls will steal your eyes.
- Yup.

03:10.647 --> 03:12.523
Can I...
talk to you for a second?

03:12.524 --> 03:14.068
Um... Okay.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.902
- Weird.
- She's probably

03:15.903 --> 03:17.528
thinking about your birthday,
picking out

03:17.529 --> 03:18.779
- a little friend for you.
- Oh, no.

03:18.780 --> 03:20.200
Louise, no!

03:20.366 --> 03:21.490
What is it?

03:21.491 --> 03:23.367
It's a dollhouse
murder mystery

03:23.368 --> 03:25.203
hosted by me
and Miss Bisselbender

03:25.204 --> 03:26.829
tomorrow morning
at the dollhouse store.

03:26.830 --> 03:28.331
- Why?
- What do you mean why?

03:28.332 --> 03:30.875
Because I'm a creative
little whippersnapper

03:30.876 --> 03:33.961
and it's a fun, festive,
almost-Halloween event

03:33.962 --> 03:35.338
and, uh... yeah.

03:35.339 --> 03:36.923
And you set it all up?

03:36.924 --> 03:38.841
Yes, I mean I will,
with Miss Bisselbender.

03:38.842 --> 03:40.134
I'll be going
over there early.

03:40.135 --> 03:41.260
I've got the script
right here.

03:41.261 --> 03:44.180
That's what you were writing while
Gene and I worked in the restaurant?

03:44.181 --> 03:46.140
- Not that we noticed or anything.
- Yes.

03:46.141 --> 03:48.142
And we're supposed to be okay
around all those dolls,

03:48.143 --> 03:49.727
and we're supposed
to solve a crime?

03:49.728 --> 03:52.021
Yes. There are clues
and it's a whole thing.

03:52.022 --> 03:54.523
I want to do
a dollhouse murder mystery.

03:54.524 --> 03:55.775
No, it's not for grown-ups.

03:55.776 --> 03:57.443
But Miss Bisselbender's
a grown-up.

03:57.444 --> 03:58.653
She plays with dolls.

03:58.654 --> 04:00.613
Anyway, it's not for you,
it's for Gene and Tina.

04:00.614 --> 04:01.906
Gene, you'll do it, right?

04:01.907 --> 04:03.574
Sure. I'm not doing
anything else.

04:03.575 --> 04:04.992
Well, what if I just
come and watch?

04:04.993 --> 04:07.580
What? No. Don't you have
to run a restaurant?

04:07.705 --> 04:08.913
Your own crime scene?

04:08.914 --> 04:10.790
- Your dad can open.
- Wait, by myself?

04:10.791 --> 04:12.041
Yeah. Just for a bit.

04:12.042 --> 04:13.292
But Teddy
will probably come in

04:13.293 --> 04:16.379
- and then it would just be me and Teddy.
- Yeah, so?

04:16.380 --> 04:19.006
Well, you know how he started doing
hand and wrist exercises?

04:19.007 --> 04:20.132
Oh, yeah.

04:20.133 --> 04:22.009
So now all he talks about
is his grip strength.

04:22.010 --> 04:23.511
Please, don't leave me
alone with him.

04:23.512 --> 04:24.929
He keeps making me
shake hands with him

04:24.930 --> 04:26.847
and he squeezes too hard
and he says...

04:26.848 --> 04:28.266
"Do you feel that?
Do you feel that?"

04:28.267 --> 04:30.017
- Okay, you can come.
- Yay!

04:30.018 --> 04:32.311
Ugh. Fine. I just feel
like you two should find

04:32.312 --> 04:34.232
people your own age
to hang out with.

04:34.732 --> 04:37.360
Here we are, ready to solve
a doll murder,

04:37.485 --> 04:39.819
and hopefully not be doll-murdered.

04:39.820 --> 04:40.987
Starting to rain.

04:40.988 --> 04:42.697
Is that part of the mystery,
do you think?

04:42.698 --> 04:45.157
I don't know how
she'd arrange it, but maybe?

04:45.158 --> 04:46.242
Ooh.

04:46.243 --> 04:48.411
"Private event." So exclusive.

04:48.412 --> 04:52.081
Like Julian's exclusive thing,
which is happening today.

04:52.082 --> 04:53.457
Aw. Poor Gene.

04:53.458 --> 04:55.001
I'm glad you're with us

04:55.002 --> 04:56.919
instead of doing PlayStations
with dumb boys.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.337
- Mm.
- Welcome.

04:58.338 --> 05:00.383
Please, right this way, detectives.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.218
I just like to murder
the dolls for the photos,

05:04.219 --> 05:06.804
and, clearly, as an act of
aggression against my parents...

05:06.805 --> 05:09.890
who I love. But Louise added
this whole mystery thing.

05:09.891 --> 05:11.767
So much work.
This isn't for school?

05:11.768 --> 05:13.686
Not at all. Better
if the school doesn't know

05:13.687 --> 05:15.396
about my murder pictures, actually.

05:15.397 --> 05:17.440
- No problem.
- So this is just for fun?

05:17.441 --> 05:20.276
Um, well, I mean, you know...

05:20.277 --> 05:22.611
Tina and Gene will be
shown the scene of the crime,

05:22.612 --> 05:24.196
they'll be able
to interview the suspects,

05:24.197 --> 05:25.781
to review evidence,

05:25.782 --> 05:27.867
and then, they will be asked
to solve the crime.

05:27.868 --> 05:29.493
And I have coffee and bagels
for the grown-ups.

05:29.494 --> 05:31.537
- Did you say mimosas?
- I, uh...

05:31.538 --> 05:34.457
Sorry. Sometimes she thinks
things sound like "mimosas."

05:34.458 --> 05:36.167
One of these days,
I'm gonna be right.

05:36.168 --> 05:37.668
Coffee's good.
Coffee's better.

05:37.669 --> 05:38.753
Thank you.

05:38.754 --> 05:39.962
Can we do this?

05:39.963 --> 05:42.089
So a group of men
who once attended

05:42.090 --> 05:44.216
the same fancy all-boys
boarding school

05:44.217 --> 05:47.180
have each received
an invitation to come to this house...

05:48.264 --> 05:51.098
The luxurious and remote estate
of one of their classmates,

05:51.099 --> 05:52.224
Mr. Sweater.

05:52.225 --> 05:54.018
This was the scene
last night at dinner.

05:54.019 --> 05:56.103
This is Mr. Sweater
at the head of the table.

05:56.104 --> 05:57.355
Handsome. For a doll.

05:57.356 --> 06:00.858
This is Mr. Brown Suit, this is Mr. Tie,
this is Mr. Funny Eyes,

06:00.859 --> 06:03.194
this is Mr. Stiff Arms,
and this is Mr. Jacket.

06:03.195 --> 06:05.654
Tiny, beady-eyed,
semi-handsome man dolls.

06:05.655 --> 06:07.782
Thank you, Tina.
Mr. Sweater explained

06:07.783 --> 06:10.201
he recently learned something,
something disturbing,

06:10.202 --> 06:11.744
having to do with an incident

06:11.745 --> 06:13.662
that happened back
in their school days,

06:13.663 --> 06:15.623
and he brought them all here
to discuss it.

06:15.624 --> 06:18.542
This much was overheard
by the private chef, but nothing more.

06:18.543 --> 06:20.294
What was Mr. Sweater
upset about?

06:20.295 --> 06:22.797
That's for you to uncover
in the course of your investigation.

06:22.798 --> 06:25.132
But here's what happened
later that night...

06:25.133 --> 06:26.217
- Ah!
- Oh!

06:26.218 --> 06:27.636
Ready.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.973
I'll be playing some
sound effects on my phone.

06:32.974 --> 06:34.475
It's an app.

06:34.476 --> 06:35.935
That night,
the chef discovered

06:35.936 --> 06:38.104
Mr. Brown Suit dead on the floor
in the living room.

06:38.105 --> 06:40.314
He was bleeding
from the side of his head.

06:40.315 --> 06:42.525
And this decorative item
was found on the floor nearby

06:42.526 --> 06:43.860
with his blood all over it.

06:44.987 --> 06:47.363
The chef called the police
who arrived and called the coroner.

06:47.364 --> 06:49.448
Mr. Brown Suit was pronounced
dead at the scene.

06:49.449 --> 06:51.283
The crime scene has
remained untouched.

06:51.284 --> 06:54.203
No one who was in the house
at the time of Mr. Brown Suit's death

06:54.204 --> 06:55.329
has been permitted to leave.

06:55.330 --> 06:57.373
You two are
the detectives who arrive

06:57.374 --> 06:59.458
in order to question
the guests and determine

06:59.459 --> 07:01.293
exactly what happened here.

07:01.294 --> 07:03.045
You should know there's
a storm in the area.

07:03.046 --> 07:04.964
It may cause periodic
and possibly

07:04.965 --> 07:06.799
theatrically
dramatic blackouts.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.592
Yup. Thank you.

07:08.593 --> 07:11.053
Is there something written
by where the body was?

07:11.054 --> 07:14.223
Yes, Mr. Brown Suit appears to have
written something in his own blood.

07:14.224 --> 07:16.767
His right index finger
would suggest that, anyway.

07:16.768 --> 07:18.980
Oh, look at his little finger.
Red.

07:19.647 --> 07:21.730
It says "camel toe"?

07:21.731 --> 07:22.940
- Wait. What?
- Yup.

07:22.941 --> 07:24.024
Huh.

07:24.025 --> 07:26.110
I have questions.
Not detective questions.

07:26.111 --> 07:27.653
"Me to you" questions.

07:27.654 --> 07:29.780
I can explain. It's like
when a lady's pants--

07:29.781 --> 07:32.575
No. I mean,
not "what is it?" Why is it?

07:32.576 --> 07:34.410
I didn't know about it
till I went to a pool party

07:34.411 --> 07:35.703
at my cousin Sheri's house.

07:35.704 --> 07:37.246
She had
on this tight florescent--

07:37.247 --> 07:38.330
- Lin.
- Mom!

07:38.331 --> 07:39.832
Gene, please, just keep going.

07:39.833 --> 07:41.250
All will be revealed.

07:41.251 --> 07:43.002
Yeah, all of my cousin Sheri
was revealed--

07:43.003 --> 07:44.336
- Mom.
- Sorry.

07:44.337 --> 07:46.380
Did he move? Oh, God,
did that doll fricking move?

07:46.381 --> 07:47.715
No, that-- that's where he was.

07:47.716 --> 07:49.469
Never mind. All good.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.806
"Special hours today.
Open at 12:30."

07:55.807 --> 07:58.225
What? No! What? Why?

07:58.226 --> 07:59.810
"Teddy, don't be upset.

07:59.811 --> 08:02.188
Go home and use
your gripper till then."

08:02.189 --> 08:03.397
Okay. All right.

08:03.398 --> 08:04.815
That's a good idea.

08:04.816 --> 08:06.817
I wonder if I can do
a thousand on each hand.

08:06.818 --> 08:09.278
Bob's gonna flip out
when I tell him I can do a thousand.

08:09.279 --> 08:11.155
He'll be like, "What? No way.

08:11.156 --> 08:13.784
Teddy, you just keep
wowing me again and again."

08:14.869 --> 08:16.785
So we interview the guests?

08:16.786 --> 08:19.038
Yes. They're ready
in the library.

08:19.039 --> 08:20.498
You can use
the room downstairs

08:20.499 --> 08:22.124
to interrogate each one
individually.

08:22.125 --> 08:23.667
Okay, so, um,

08:23.668 --> 08:25.461
let's ask some dolls
some questions.

08:25.462 --> 08:27.922
I'm totally comfortable
with that.

08:27.923 --> 08:30.591
Mr. Funny Eyes, where were you
between the end of dinner

08:30.592 --> 08:32.551
and the time Mr. Brown Suit's
body was found?

08:32.552 --> 08:34.470
I was in my room.
I can prove it.

08:34.471 --> 08:37.181
I live streamed my workout.
I'm a personal trainer.

08:37.182 --> 08:39.433
Interesting.
Funny eyes. Serious body.

08:39.434 --> 08:40.976
- Gene, make a note.
- Mm.

08:40.977 --> 08:42.144
Mr. Stiff Arms.

08:42.145 --> 08:44.148
Where were you
between the end of dinner

08:44.273 --> 08:45.481
and the time of the murder?

08:45.482 --> 08:47.149
Going sideways
through doorways?

08:47.150 --> 08:48.651
I went into town after dinner.

08:48.652 --> 08:49.902
Mr. Jacket was with me.

08:49.903 --> 08:51.028
You did, huh?

08:51.029 --> 08:53.489
- It's true.
- Where'd you go in town? Alibis "R" Us?

08:53.490 --> 08:54.907
I'm bad cop, you're good cop.

08:54.908 --> 08:56.617
Unless you want to be bad cop?

08:56.618 --> 08:58.827
I'm good. I mean,
I'm good with good cop.

08:58.828 --> 09:00.371
We went
to the cool jacket store.

09:00.372 --> 09:02.831
'Cause we like cool jackets.
As you can see.

09:02.832 --> 09:04.041
I was in my room.

09:04.042 --> 09:05.960
Can someone confirm that,
Mr. Tie?

09:05.961 --> 09:08.546
Yeah, Mr. Sweater saw me there.
He came to talk to me.

09:08.547 --> 09:10.548
- About what?
- Old stuff.

09:10.549 --> 09:13.551
You know, like "Hey, remember
all that old stuff?"

09:13.552 --> 09:15.261
Let's talk to Mr. Sweater.

09:15.262 --> 09:17.221
So this is your house,
you're the one who organized

09:17.222 --> 09:18.432
- all this?
- Yes.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.641
Interesting. Interesting.

09:20.642 --> 09:21.976
You were talking to Mr. Tie

09:21.977 --> 09:23.102
when Mr. Brown Suit was killed?

09:23.103 --> 09:24.687
- Yes.
- What were you talking about?

09:24.688 --> 09:26.480
Something that happened
a long time ago,

09:26.481 --> 09:28.732
when we were in our elite
boys-only boarding school.

09:28.733 --> 09:30.568
What was it?
And don't leave out any details.

09:30.569 --> 09:33.070
They might be important. Did all
the boys shower at the same time?

09:33.071 --> 09:35.197
That's just an example
of a detail that might be important.

09:35.198 --> 09:36.365
- But did they?
- Sometimes.

09:36.366 --> 09:37.700
Hmm. Mm...

09:37.701 --> 09:39.870
I learned recently
that there was an event.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.495
Something that I wasn't
invited to.

09:41.496 --> 09:42.913
What kind of event?

09:42.914 --> 09:45.251
A small Halloween gathering
at Mr. Jacket's.

09:45.376 --> 09:48.002
- Louise, what is this?
- Just then, you hear a scream.

09:48.003 --> 09:50.172
And... ready.

09:52.049 --> 09:53.674
- Mr. Tie is dead.
- Whoa!

09:53.675 --> 09:55.970
It appears he's had a fall
when the lights were off.

09:56.178 --> 09:58.053
Or was he pushed? A lot?

09:58.054 --> 10:00.558
Would you like to examine
the scene?

10:02.727 --> 10:04.685
Has he got something in his pocket?

10:04.686 --> 10:05.980
Is it a piece of paper?

10:06.105 --> 10:08.772
Huh. Looks like a tiny
newspaper clipping.

10:08.773 --> 10:10.065
Oh. Tiny clue.

10:10.066 --> 10:12.484
Um, how much of this
did Louise explain to you?

10:12.485 --> 10:14.403
'Cause I assumed everything,

10:14.404 --> 10:16.780
but I'm starting to think
maybe nothing.

10:16.781 --> 10:18.782
- Explain what?
- Um, this.

10:18.783 --> 10:21.535
That you're a nice lady
who does creepy stuff

10:21.536 --> 10:24.413
in a totally cute, not creepy
at all dollhouse store,

10:24.414 --> 10:25.748
and Louise got excited?

10:25.749 --> 10:27.708
Uh, well, it's...
it's more than that.

10:27.709 --> 10:29.585
Uh, does it involve camel toe?

10:29.586 --> 10:31.003
- Yup.
- Yup, I figured.

10:31.004 --> 10:32.755
Um, lot of talking over there.

10:32.756 --> 10:33.922
Sorry, we'll whisper.

10:33.923 --> 10:36.383
It's kind of, um,
there's some backstory.

10:36.384 --> 10:38.010
Ooh, backstory.

10:38.011 --> 10:40.387
- The whispering's louder somehow.
- Sorry.

10:40.388 --> 10:41.930
Nine hundred and...

10:41.931 --> 10:43.724
ninety-nine...

10:43.725 --> 10:45.893
One thousand!

10:45.894 --> 10:47.938
Oh! Yes!

10:48.147 --> 10:49.564
Oh, Teddy, you did it!

10:53.361 --> 10:56.278
Ah, it's not 12:30 yet.
Damn it.

10:56.279 --> 10:58.572
Eh, maybe I'll text Bob.
He'll want to know.

10:58.573 --> 11:01.533
Oh, God, my hands.
They won't close.

11:01.534 --> 11:03.410
No! What have I done?

11:03.411 --> 11:05.871
Ah! Ah! My hands!

11:05.872 --> 11:08.207
<i>Mr. Tie's twisted body
has been removed.</i>

11:08.208 --> 11:09.917
You have the article
you found in his pocket?

11:09.918 --> 11:11.251
What'd you learn from that?

11:11.252 --> 11:12.920
That there was an accident
at the boarding school

11:12.921 --> 11:14.797
when all these boys
were seniors.

11:14.798 --> 11:17.383
A teacher fell from
a third-floor window and died.

11:17.384 --> 11:18.676
- Oh, no. Sad.
- Shh.

11:18.677 --> 11:19.802
- What? It is.
- Shh.

11:19.803 --> 11:20.969
Okay.

11:20.970 --> 11:22.554
So, any questions
for these fellas?

11:22.555 --> 11:24.264
- Yeah. Who did it?
- Did what?

11:24.265 --> 11:26.225
Killed Mr. Brown Suit
and maybe Mr. Tie.

11:26.226 --> 11:28.435
And why are teachers
falling out of windows?

11:28.436 --> 11:30.104
Mr. Sweater.
Mr. Sweater must have killed

11:30.105 --> 11:31.814
Mr. Brown Suit and Mr. Tie.

11:31.815 --> 11:34.441
Aha! Or, uh, why?

11:34.442 --> 11:35.901
He's the one
who brought us here.

11:35.902 --> 11:37.444
He's not the killer.
He just wants to know

11:37.445 --> 11:39.571
why he wasn't invited
to your gathering.

11:39.572 --> 11:41.156
Gene. You can't let
your personal feelings

11:41.157 --> 11:42.866
influence your judgment
about the case.

11:42.867 --> 11:44.952
Yes, I can.
Because my personal feelings

11:44.953 --> 11:47.079
are part of it
for some reason.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.872
- Why is this about me?
- It's not.

11:48.873 --> 11:51.168
- Wait. Is it?
- I mean...

11:52.670 --> 11:53.669
Ready.

11:53.670 --> 11:55.379
- Ah!
- Oh!

11:55.380 --> 11:56.505
Mr. Stiff Arms.

11:56.506 --> 11:58.298
Another accident?
Tripped and fell?

11:58.299 --> 12:00.008
- Mr. Stiff.
- It's Mr. Stiff Arms.

12:00.009 --> 12:01.468
- What'd I say?
- You said Mr. Stiff.

12:01.469 --> 12:02.636
You're Mr. Stiff.

12:02.637 --> 12:03.929
Geez. Power outages.

12:03.930 --> 12:06.684
This is a very dangerous place
to have intermittent power problems.

12:10.354 --> 12:13.689
You think he fell, um,
under the couch leg somehow?

12:13.690 --> 12:14.898
I didn't do it, I swear.

12:14.899 --> 12:16.483
Well, I didn't do it.
I didn't move.

12:16.484 --> 12:17.693
Either one of you could have.

12:17.694 --> 12:19.403
The only one
I don't suspect is the chef.

12:19.404 --> 12:21.073
The chef was hiding
behind the door.

12:21.198 --> 12:22.239
Damn it.

12:22.240 --> 12:23.782
We've got three bodies
and three suspects.

12:23.783 --> 12:25.576
Mr. Funny Eyes
is a personal trainer.

12:25.577 --> 12:28.328
Probably super strong,
super-tight core, tight buns.

12:28.329 --> 12:30.205
- Could he be doing this?
- I don't know.

12:30.206 --> 12:33.375
Can we skip ahead to the end
and you tell us all what's going on?

12:33.376 --> 12:35.628
Gene, can you just play
a little longer? Please?

12:37.131 --> 12:39.173
Gene, we've gotta ask about
that teacher that died.

12:39.174 --> 12:41.383
That has to be important.
Are you with me, partner?

12:41.384 --> 12:43.220
Okay, fine. I'll ask.

12:43.345 --> 12:45.095
So why doesn't someone
tell us what happened

12:45.096 --> 12:46.388
on that day at the school

12:46.389 --> 12:48.140
when the teacher
fell out the window?

12:48.141 --> 12:50.100
Well, we didn't
push her or anything.

12:50.101 --> 12:51.393
Mr. Funny Eyes, shut up!

12:51.394 --> 12:52.853
You don't have to say
anything about that.

12:52.854 --> 12:54.688
"We," Mr. Funny Eyes?
Who's we?

12:54.689 --> 12:56.440
All of us. We were all there.

12:56.441 --> 12:58.275
I mean, till Mr. Sweater left.

12:58.276 --> 12:59.443
He had to go number two.

12:59.444 --> 13:00.527
- Number two.
- Mom, shh.

13:00.528 --> 13:01.655
- Yup.
- Ready.

13:03.741 --> 13:06.408
We flash back to the
boarding school 20 years ago.

13:06.409 --> 13:08.202
We're in the library,
on the third floor.

13:08.203 --> 13:09.369
It's a study period.

13:09.370 --> 13:11.288
All the boys were there
except Mr. Sweater.

13:11.289 --> 13:13.542
The teacher was named
Miss Bickelbonger.

13:16.712 --> 13:19.630
Uh, Miss Bickelbonger was the proctor
for a study period in library.

13:19.631 --> 13:21.882
She was wearing a pair of pants
that fit a bit more

13:21.883 --> 13:25.385
snugly than she thought,
and were maybe a bit clingy.

13:25.386 --> 13:27.554
And the thing is, she had
worn them before at school,

13:27.555 --> 13:30.390
and so me and some of the other boys had
some running jokes about it.

13:30.391 --> 13:32.142
Shut up, Mr. Funny Eyes!

13:32.143 --> 13:33.811
I'm telling what happened,
Mr. Jacket!

13:33.812 --> 13:35.354
Not if I break your face!

13:35.355 --> 13:37.731
That's enough.
Gene, hold Mr. Jacket.

13:37.732 --> 13:39.274
Mr. Funny Eyes, continue.

13:39.275 --> 13:41.151
There were tall windows
on the third floor

13:41.152 --> 13:43.445
and Miss Bickelbonger
got up to open them

13:43.446 --> 13:46.406
and let in some air and, um,
when she turned back around,

13:46.407 --> 13:48.784
she noticed us whispering and giggling.

13:48.785 --> 13:50.702
Sorry. Sorry.

13:50.703 --> 13:52.704
<i>Please leave me a message.</i>

13:52.705 --> 13:53.997
Voicemail! No! Bob!

13:53.998 --> 13:56.377
I-- I can't use my hands.
I can't turn the doorknob.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.126
I can't do anything.

13:58.127 --> 14:00.379
Eh, it took me so long to
dial the phone with my nose.

14:00.380 --> 14:02.297
Please! Pick up!

14:02.298 --> 14:04.676
<i>If you're satisfied
with your message, please press one.</i>

14:05.970 --> 14:07.928
Um, it's on silent now.
I think.

14:07.929 --> 14:09.721
- I can't tell, actually.
- Bob, shh.

14:09.722 --> 14:10.806
- Yup.
- Right.

14:10.807 --> 14:12.683
Louise, I don't know how
you know any of this stuff

14:12.684 --> 14:14.768
and I'm confused
and I don't like it.

14:14.769 --> 14:17.729
I don't know how to
say anything except to just...

14:17.730 --> 14:20.691
can we keep going just
a little bit longer, please?

14:20.692 --> 14:22.484
Ugh, fine.

14:22.485 --> 14:24.778
Okay, so Mr. Funny Eyes
continues...

14:24.779 --> 14:25.863
We were giggling.

14:25.864 --> 14:27.781
Miss Bickelbonger asked
what the laughing was about.

14:27.782 --> 14:29.741
And we didn't answer,
but Miss Bickelbonger,

14:29.742 --> 14:31.451
she sort of followed our eyes,
I guess.

14:31.452 --> 14:32.953
And then she saw
what we were laughing at,

14:32.954 --> 14:34.830
and she started
tugging at her pants,

14:34.831 --> 14:36.290
and that made us laugh more.

14:36.291 --> 14:38.333
And Mr. Jacket
was laughing the most.

14:38.334 --> 14:39.835
And she was pretty upset
at that point,

14:39.836 --> 14:42.045
and he kept laughing,
even after we stopped,

14:42.046 --> 14:43.672
and she kinda backed up

14:43.673 --> 14:46.592
and she was also still
trying to adjust her pants,

14:46.593 --> 14:48.302
and she backed right up
to that big open window

14:48.303 --> 14:51.097
and she just...
went over backwards.

14:52.266 --> 14:53.473
Death by camel toe.

14:53.474 --> 14:55.225
- Toe-micide.
- And then what?

14:55.226 --> 14:56.476
We lied!

14:56.477 --> 14:57.978
We didn't tell
the police anything.

14:57.979 --> 14:59.730
We said none of us
saw her fall.

14:59.731 --> 15:01.857
Mr. Jacket made us
swear we'd never tell.

15:01.858 --> 15:03.775
And we felt bad,
but we went along with it

15:03.776 --> 15:06.445
'cause I guess we just
wanted to move on, you know?

15:06.446 --> 15:08.071
Ivy League universities
don't love it

15:08.072 --> 15:09.656
if you've laughed someone
out a window.

15:09.657 --> 15:11.325
Even back then
it was frowned upon.

15:11.326 --> 15:13.035
Too bad Miss Bickelbonger
couldn't move on.

15:13.036 --> 15:14.412
'Cause she was dead!

15:16.540 --> 15:17.748
- Storm.
- Yeah, I know.

15:17.749 --> 15:19.875
- Sorry, you looked confused.
- I'm not confused.

15:19.876 --> 15:21.837
- I'm just standing here watching.
- Shh.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.339
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

15:25.340 --> 15:26.840
Okay, that's you, Mr. Jacket.

15:26.841 --> 15:28.508
You just did that,
um, somehow.

15:28.509 --> 15:30.010
And we know the motive.

15:30.011 --> 15:31.386
To keep him quiet
about what happened.

15:31.387 --> 15:33.597
If I was trying to do that,
I would've done it sooner.

15:33.598 --> 15:35.265
Plus, your partner
is restraining me.

15:35.266 --> 15:38.477
All right, then, um, Mr. Sweater,
you're the killer after all.

15:38.478 --> 15:39.686
I would never hurt anyone.

15:39.687 --> 15:41.063
Oh, perfect Mr. Sweater!

15:41.064 --> 15:42.981
"I would never hurt anyone."

15:42.982 --> 15:45.609
This is why I didn't
invite you to my gathering back then.

15:45.610 --> 15:47.319
You're too nice.
You were always like,

15:47.320 --> 15:48.904
"Don't make that
very funny running joke

15:48.905 --> 15:51.031
about Miss Bickelbonger's
pants situation."

15:51.032 --> 15:52.784
That's why
you didn't invite me?

15:55.996 --> 15:57.704
- Ah!
- Oh, boy.

15:57.705 --> 15:59.873
- Whoa, the head's gone.
- Okay. Case solved, right?

15:59.874 --> 16:01.333
Mr. Sweater
did it for revenge?

16:01.334 --> 16:02.793
He killed them all
for revenge?

16:02.794 --> 16:04.211
- Did he, Gene?
- No.

16:04.212 --> 16:05.629
- No?
- No!

16:05.630 --> 16:07.297
You're correct. It was...

16:07.298 --> 16:09.007
- The chef?
- Correct.

16:09.008 --> 16:10.592
- The chef. The chef did it.
- Yes.

16:10.593 --> 16:12.344
- I called it.
- No. They just--

16:12.345 --> 16:14.554
You can't predict the murderer
after the case is solved.

16:14.555 --> 16:16.348
- I knew it was him.
- I don't think you did.

16:16.349 --> 16:18.475
Yes, I said it's either
Mr. Jacket, Mr. Stiff,

16:18.476 --> 16:20.268
Mr. Sweater, Mr. Tie,
or the chef.

16:20.269 --> 16:22.604
So, one of the characters
in the story did it.

16:22.605 --> 16:24.022
Uh, yes. Hello?

16:24.023 --> 16:25.524
- Right. No, no, that's--
- Pay attention, Bob.

16:25.525 --> 16:27.109
- Yep.
- Wait. Why was it the chef?

16:27.110 --> 16:28.568
What was the motive?

16:28.569 --> 16:31.655
Because the chef
is not a boring old-man chef.

16:31.656 --> 16:33.031
- Yeah, Bob.
- Mm.

16:33.032 --> 16:36.452
It is, in fact, Mr. Sweater's
sister, Miss Sweater!

16:37.788 --> 16:40.163
The chef is Mr. Sweater's sister?

16:40.164 --> 16:42.124
Yeah. She hated
what they did to her brother,

16:42.125 --> 16:44.376
and she killed them all
in revenge.

16:44.377 --> 16:45.919
Wait, what did they do
to her brother?

16:45.920 --> 16:48.213
- Not invite him to the thing.
- So she killed them?

16:48.214 --> 16:50.048
- All those years later?
- Yes.

16:50.049 --> 16:51.299
I don't want to play anymore.

16:51.300 --> 16:52.718
Louise!

16:52.719 --> 16:54.344
What the heck is going on
with you and Gene?

16:54.345 --> 16:57.514
Louise murdered a bunch
of Miss Bisselbender's parents' dolls

16:57.515 --> 16:59.891
instead of telling me
something she wants to tell me!

16:59.892 --> 17:01.228
Is that right?

17:01.353 --> 17:02.396
Uh...

17:02.563 --> 17:04.438
- Is that right?
- Yes.

17:04.439 --> 17:07.067
Ooh.

17:10.070 --> 17:12.070
- Louise?
- Uh...

17:12.071 --> 17:14.031
- Can I help?
- Please.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.907
This is what I was trying to say before.

17:15.908 --> 17:18.952
Um, a week ago, I was subbing
in the sixth-grade homeroom.

17:18.953 --> 17:20.954
Uh, Gene is wonderful,
by the way.

17:20.955 --> 17:22.080
- Yeah, he is.
- Really?

17:22.081 --> 17:23.415
- Yeah.
- I mean, at school?

17:23.416 --> 17:24.499
Uh, are you kidding me?

17:24.500 --> 17:25.667
Yeah, uh, yeah. Of course.

17:25.668 --> 17:27.502
And I was a good sub.
Press play on the movie,

17:27.503 --> 17:29.171
press stop
at the end of the period.

17:29.172 --> 17:31.339
And one day we had "library,"
which is great for a sub.

17:31.340 --> 17:32.841
You just bring the kids
to the library.

17:32.842 --> 17:34.760
But, turns out
that the fourth grade

17:34.761 --> 17:36.803
<i>also had library
during that period,</i>

17:36.804 --> 17:39.639
<i>so I came across Louise,
who I didn't know at the time,</i>

17:39.640 --> 17:41.933
<i>and she was just
sort of standing there</i>

17:41.934 --> 17:43.560
<i>and then I realized</i>

17:43.561 --> 17:45.771
<i>that she was listening
to some sixth-grade boys</i>

17:45.772 --> 17:47.689
<i>talking on the other side
of the shelves.</i>

17:47.690 --> 17:49.566
Hey, did you catch
the substitute's camel toe?

17:49.567 --> 17:51.234
Yeah.

17:51.235 --> 17:52.736
- <i>And Gene said...</i>
- What's camel toe?

17:52.737 --> 17:54.988
<i>And they told him,
and he and I learned what that means</i>

17:54.989 --> 17:56.698
<i>and I don't see
what the big deal is.</i>

17:56.699 --> 17:58.408
<i>Mom, I think
you have that a lot.</i>

17:58.409 --> 17:59.910
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>And then Gene said...</i>

17:59.911 --> 18:02.621
Guys, come on.
Miss Bisselbender's nice. I like her.

18:02.622 --> 18:04.124
<i>And they stopped laughing
and you said...</i>

18:04.249 --> 18:05.415
Speaking of camels,

18:05.416 --> 18:07.209
I've got a hump that
I've gotta go take care of,

18:07.210 --> 18:08.835
if you know what I mean.

18:08.836 --> 18:10.545
I've gotta go to the bathroom,
is what I'm saying.

18:10.546 --> 18:12.255
Mr. Ambrose,
I need a bathroom pass

18:12.256 --> 18:14.341
and can you mark it "express"?
That'd be great.

18:14.342 --> 18:15.592
<i>And then they said...</i>

18:15.593 --> 18:17.511
Hey, are you gonna invite
Gene to your gathering?

18:17.512 --> 18:19.346
Yeah, I don't know,
he's kind of a Goody Two-shoes.

18:19.347 --> 18:21.556
I mean, could we
even joke around?

18:21.557 --> 18:24.684
Yeah, I need to talk about
Miss Bisselbender's pants situation.

18:24.685 --> 18:26.686
I-- I need to process.

18:26.687 --> 18:28.730
- Those tweeny twerps.
- Yeah. I heard them.

18:28.731 --> 18:30.023
We both heard them.

18:30.024 --> 18:32.359
I didn't fall out of a window,
but it was awkward.

18:32.360 --> 18:35.153
I was gonna talk to the boys,
but then I wasn't sure what to say.

18:35.154 --> 18:38.198
And I didn't even know Louise
was Gene's sister until yesterday.

18:38.199 --> 18:40.200
And I was about to say
something to those idiots,

18:40.201 --> 18:41.954
but I didn't. I choked.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.829
<i>Then at lunch that day,
I was about to tell you.</i>

18:43.830 --> 18:45.372
<i>But I didn't because
I would have to admit</i>

18:45.373 --> 18:47.457
<i>that I didn't say anything
in the library.</i>

18:47.458 --> 18:49.251
And it's the exact opposite
of what you did.

18:49.252 --> 18:52.045
You just said the nice, decent thing
without even thinking about it.

18:52.046 --> 18:53.922
<i>Then walking home,
I was about to tell you.</i>

18:53.923 --> 18:55.715
<i>And at home,
I was about to tell you.</i>

18:55.716 --> 18:57.259
And then I tried
to just not think about it

18:57.260 --> 18:58.969
and I didn't even know
if they were still having

18:58.970 --> 19:01.304
the stupid gathering,
but then you found out about it

19:01.305 --> 19:03.181
<i>on Friday, and I went
through it all again.</i>

19:03.182 --> 19:05.142
<i>And then we saw
Miss Bisselbender in here.</i>

19:05.143 --> 19:07.644
<i>And she showed us the crime
scene pictures and I just...</i>

19:07.645 --> 19:10.772
<i>I just wanted to make
a dollhouse murder mystery</i>

19:10.773 --> 19:14.067
<i>that somehow, uh,
was like, um...</i>

19:14.068 --> 19:18.071
An explanation and an apology
and a compliment

19:18.072 --> 19:21.366
using murder, for a sweet kid
who doesn't judge people

19:21.367 --> 19:24.496
by their possibly
too tight pants situations,

19:24.621 --> 19:26.955
and who I think made
a real impression on his sister.

19:26.956 --> 19:28.582
Yeah. All of that.

19:28.583 --> 19:30.750
And I didn't know Mom and Dad
were gonna come.

19:30.751 --> 19:32.210
It was cooler in my mind
without them.

19:32.211 --> 19:33.380
Aww, you're welcome.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.048
Anyway, sorry.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.299
So you're saying you didn't
know how to tell me

19:37.300 --> 19:40.177
that the reason I didn't
get invited to the party

19:40.178 --> 19:42.512
is because I'm too wonderful?

19:42.513 --> 19:45.473
- Yeah.
- I get that. It's hard on the others.

19:45.474 --> 19:46.766
Louise, you can also tell me.

19:46.767 --> 19:49.104
- Next time, right? Big sister?
- I know.

19:49.229 --> 19:52.814
- Or your mom.
- Uh, I'm, uh, also an option.

19:52.815 --> 19:55.066
- I'm a good listener.
- People, please.

19:55.067 --> 19:57.068
What can I say?
I communicate this way now.

19:57.069 --> 19:58.612
I want to do
a dollhouse murder mystery

19:58.613 --> 20:00.197
- about who broke the remote.
- Wait, what?

20:00.198 --> 20:02.157
Mom and Dad, pay the woman.
We're taking this home.

20:02.158 --> 20:03.742
- No.
- We can't get that.

20:03.743 --> 20:05.493
Damn it. What about this one?
It's smaller,

20:05.494 --> 20:07.287
but it's got a great layout
and a lot of natural light.

20:07.288 --> 20:08.538
- No.
- Sorry.

20:08.539 --> 20:10.582
This one's got blood all over it,
probably discounted.

20:10.583 --> 20:11.708
I mean, it's thread.

20:11.709 --> 20:14.419
Come on! Are we not walking
out of here with a dollhouse

20:14.420 --> 20:15.795
to remember how Gene stood up

20:15.796 --> 20:17.255
for Miss Bisselbender's
camel toe?

20:17.256 --> 20:19.009
Not today, hon.
