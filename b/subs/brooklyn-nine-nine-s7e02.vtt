I'm sure it will be

and we've always managed

00:47.214 --> 00:48.507
to get rid of them.

Do you think you can have the

00:51.343 --> 00:52.636
new captain gone by Monday?

00:52.678 --> 00:53.971
I'm kind of over meeting

That how we do it

01:13.114 --> 01:14.533
in the Nine-Nine.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.201
You're going the

01:14.575 --> 01:16.201
wrong direction.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.619
Damn it. All these

01:16.243 --> 01:17.619

01:47.900 --> 01:49.359
this is my chance to

01:47.900 --> 01:49.359
reinvent myself.

So say hello to Chuck Boyle,

Wait a minute.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.406
Is that Rosa's jacket?

01:54.448 --> 01:55.741
And follow-up question,

01:55.783 --> 01:57.325
does Rosa's jacket

01:55.783 --> 01:57.325
fit you perfectly?

[scoffs]

01:57.367 --> 01:58.619
You tell me.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.412
You know, just put

01:58.660 --> 02:00.412
on a leather jacket

02:00.454 --> 02:01.872
and become a badass.

02:01.914 --> 02:03.749
You also need a

02:01.914 --> 02:03.749
chunky bracelet

02:01.914 --> 02:03.749
with a fringe.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.584
Wrong. Ever since

It says "Charles,"

02:09.964 --> 02:11.548
not "Cassie."

02:11.590 --> 02:13.383
You know, I think it's

02:11.590 --> 02:13.383
less about the jacket

02:13.425 --> 02:15.260
and more about the fact

02:13.425 --> 02:15.260
that you're feeling confident.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.763
Maybe this cool

02:15.302 --> 02:17.763
version of Charles

02:15.302 --> 02:17.763
was in there all along.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.140

It's a magic jacket.

-OK.

02:20.181 --> 02:22.434
-So just to be clear,

02:20.181 --> 02:22.434

who the office badass is.

Anyway, I just want to say

03:01.807 --> 03:03.433
how excited am to be

here at the Nine-Nine.

my guilty pleasure

03:18.323 --> 03:21.200
is charity work,

03:18.323 --> 03:21.200
and what do I do for fun?

03:29.208 --> 03:30.627
kind of awesome to me.

The thing is,

03:30.669 --> 03:32.087
she can't be awesome

-she's moving on.

He was nice to my mom,

04:06.205 --> 04:08.040
he drove a limousine,

04:08.082 --> 04:09.290
he would take us

04:08.082 --> 04:09.290
out to restaurants.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.709
But then my mom

04:09.332 --> 04:10.709
caught him cheating,

and we never

04:10.751 --> 04:12.669
saw him again.

her choice of any precinct.

04:22.221 --> 04:25.306
I'll tell you why:

04:22.221 --> 04:25.306
because Madeline Wuntch

04:22.221 --> 04:25.306
sent her.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.308
-So what do we do?

wants to have individual

04:27.350 --> 04:28.727
meetings with us

04:28.769 --> 04:30.645
to assess our

04:28.769 --> 04:30.645
"personal strengths"

04:30.687 --> 04:32.147
and help us

"achieve our goals"?

-Stupid B.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.774

she's really here.

04:35.901 --> 04:38.570
She may seem perfect,

04:35.901 --> 04:38.570
but I guarantee you,

04:35.901 --> 04:38.570
there's a "but."

04:38.612 --> 04:41.240
And I'm gonna find

04:38.612 --> 04:41.240
that "but" and drill

04:38.612 --> 04:41.240
down on it.

Come on, man. You have

04:41.281 --> 04:42.783

05:03.678 --> 05:05.722
real fast, OK?

05:05.764 --> 05:08.183
So, Captain Kim,

05:05.764 --> 05:08.183
I've been going

05:05.764 --> 05:08.183
through your files--

05:08.225 --> 05:09.684
And I've been going

05:08.225 --> 05:09.684
through yours.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.686
-Very impressive stuff!

05:09.726 --> 05:11.686
-Oh.

05:11.728 --> 05:14.148
Not just the case work,

05:11.728 --> 05:14.148
but look at how

05:11.728 --> 05:14.148
they're organized--

05:14.189 --> 05:15.440
the penmanship,

05:14.189 --> 05:15.440
color coding.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.942
How do you get such

05:15.482 --> 05:16.942
straight margins

05:16.984 --> 05:18.568
on a hand-written

05:16.984 --> 05:18.568
document?

05:18.610 --> 05:20.946
Oh, well, I like to say

05:18.610 --> 05:20.946
when it comes to margins...

05:20.988 --> 05:22.823
[Both]

05:20.988 --> 05:22.823
There's no margin for error.

05:22.864 --> 05:26.243
-[gasps]

05:22.864 --> 05:26.243
-[both] Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!

05:26.285 --> 05:28.287
So you supposedly build

05:26.285 --> 05:28.287
skate parks, huh?

05:28.328 --> 05:29.830
What are your three

05:28.328 --> 05:29.830
favorite tricks?

05:29.871 --> 05:32.749
Oh, gingersnap,

05:29.871 --> 05:32.749
plasma spin,

05:29.871 --> 05:32.749
roast beef grab.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.084
What about you?

05:34.126 --> 05:36.170
Ollies. And the roast beef

05:34.126 --> 05:36.170
one that you said.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.879
It doesn't matter.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.879
We're both skaters.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.879
Let's move on.

05:37.921 --> 05:39.965
Well, I've been looking through

05:37.921 --> 05:39.965
your recent evaluations,

05:40.007 --> 05:42.676
and I don't think

05:40.007 --> 05:42.676
you belong here.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.803
Ohh! I knew it.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.803
You want to get rid of me.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.054
Well, you know what?

05:44.845 --> 05:46.054
You can't fire me,

05:46.096 --> 05:48.389
because I quit!

05:46.096 --> 05:48.389
Metaphorically.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.808
Obviously, for medical

05:48.431 --> 05:49.808
insurance reasons,

05:49.850 --> 05:51.643
it's much better

05:49.850 --> 05:51.643
if do you fire me.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.812
I'm not firing you.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.812
I'm very impressed

05:51.685 --> 05:53.812
by your talent

05:53.854 --> 05:56.106
and record,

05:53.854 --> 05:56.106
and it just so happens

05:56.148 --> 05:59.693
I have a friend in the FBI

05:56.148 --> 05:59.693
who is looking for

05:56.148 --> 05:59.693
an NYPD liaison officer.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.695
So what do you say?

06:01.736 --> 06:05.157
-So what<i> did</i> you say?

06:01.736 --> 06:05.157
-I told her I'd rather

06:01.736 --> 06:05.157
stick my entire head

06:05.199 --> 06:06.867
inside a giraffe's

06:05.199 --> 06:06.867
long, blond butt

06:06.908 --> 06:08.367
than accept a job

06:06.908 --> 06:08.367
offer from her.

06:08.409 --> 06:10.245
-Mm-hmm.

06:08.409 --> 06:10.245
-You said that?

06:10.287 --> 06:12.371
In my head.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.371
In my mouth I said

06:10.287 --> 06:12.371
I would think about it

06:12.413 --> 06:15.374
and get back to her.

06:12.413 --> 06:15.374
She'll get the message

06:12.413 --> 06:15.374
when I dilly-dally.

06:15.416 --> 06:17.211
Working with the FBI.

06:15.416 --> 06:17.211
That's your dream job, Jake.

06:17.252 --> 06:19.629
First of all, my dream

06:17.252 --> 06:19.629
job is spy

06:19.671 --> 06:21.340
falsely accused of

06:19.671 --> 06:21.340
betraying his country,

06:21.380 --> 06:23.717
forced to work alone

06:21.380 --> 06:23.717
to clear his name

06:23.758 --> 06:26.011
by taking down the mysterious

06:23.758 --> 06:26.011
organization that framed him

06:23.758 --> 06:26.011
known only as S.H.A.D.E.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.013
Secondly,

06:26.053 --> 06:28.013
it wasn't a real job offer.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.973
-She's up to something.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.973
-Mm-hmm.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.725
Maybe she's just

06:30.015 --> 06:31.725
a nice person. I mean,

06:31.766 --> 06:33.810
she did seem genuinely

06:31.766 --> 06:33.810
interested in my kids.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.270
Look, did any of you get

06:33.852 --> 06:35.270
a straight answer from her

06:35.312 --> 06:36.855
about why she's at

06:35.312 --> 06:36.855
at Nine-Nine, hmm?

06:36.897 --> 06:38.773
Right, me neither.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.773
But guess what.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.234
I called the C.O.P. office,

06:40.275 --> 06:42.361
and they said the form

06:40.275 --> 06:42.361
to transfer her here

06:42.401 --> 06:45.197
wasn't signed by them--

06:42.401 --> 06:45.197
it was signed by<i> Wuntch.</i>

06:45.239 --> 06:47.406
-She lied.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.406
-Mm-hmm.

06:47.448 --> 06:49.993
Just because Wuntch signed

06:47.448 --> 06:49.993
an order doesn't mean

06:47.448 --> 06:49.993
they know each other.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.913
Will you wake up?

06:50.035 --> 06:52.913
That woman is a demon, and it

06:50.035 --> 06:52.913
couldn't be more obvious.

06:52.954 --> 06:56.375
Oh, here you are.

06:52.954 --> 06:56.375
I have to say how great it

06:52.954 --> 06:56.375
was talking to you all,

06:56.415 --> 06:59.418
and I wanted to let you know

06:56.415 --> 06:59.418
about a party I'm throwing

06:56.415 --> 06:59.418
at my house tomorrow night.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.046
Are you interested?

07:01.088 --> 07:03.673
Oh, well, we will think

07:01.088 --> 07:03.673
about it and get back to you.

07:03.715 --> 07:06.093
-Great. Just let me know.

07:03.715 --> 07:06.093
-Great.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.804
And now...

07:07.010 --> 07:09.804
we dilly-dally.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.472
Mm-hmm.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.729
-What are you guys doing here?

07:16.019 --> 07:17.729
-What do you mean?

07:16.019 --> 07:17.729
We're going to the party.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.231
[Amy]

07:17.771 --> 07:19.231
You said you

07:17.771 --> 07:19.231
weren't coming.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.857
You said that Captain Kim

07:19.273 --> 07:20.857
was a Trevor

07:20.899 --> 07:22.692
and that she only invited

07:20.899 --> 07:22.692
us to earn our trust

07:22.734 --> 07:25.570
-so she could have

07:22.734 --> 07:25.570
sex with our mom.

07:22.734 --> 07:25.570
-It was very confusing.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.530
[laughs]

07:25.612 --> 07:27.530
I never said that.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.074
But it's not confusing.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.450
I mean, our "mom" is

07:29.116 --> 07:30.450
obviously the precinct,

07:30.491 --> 07:32.286
and Captain Kim having

07:30.491 --> 07:32.286
sex with the precinct

07:32.327 --> 07:34.329
is actually her teaming

07:32.327 --> 07:34.329
up with Madeline Wuntch

07:32.327 --> 07:34.329
to destroy it.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.456
It's a perfect analogy,

07:34.371 --> 07:36.456
which I never used.

07:36.497 --> 07:37.958
What's up, guys?

07:37.999 --> 07:39.584
Why are we standing

07:37.999 --> 07:39.584
around outside?

07:39.626 --> 07:41.836
Is your walk different?

07:39.626 --> 07:41.836
Are you strutting?

07:41.878 --> 07:43.922
Don't know what you're

07:41.878 --> 07:43.922
talking about. It's how

07:41.878 --> 07:43.922
I always walk, bitch.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.006
Let's roll!

07:45.048 --> 07:46.674
Bitch?

07:46.716 --> 07:48.385
Welcome.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.385
The bar is in the back.

07:48.427 --> 07:49.844
And they're coming

07:48.427 --> 07:49.844
around with food.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.805
I use the most wonderful

07:49.886 --> 07:51.805
catering company.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.932
They only hire ex-convicts to

07:51.846 --> 07:53.932
give them a second chance.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.810
-Oh, that's wonderful.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.810
-Get in here and

07:53.974 --> 07:56.810
meet everyone.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.020
Oh, Lieutenant, I want

07:56.851 --> 07:59.020
to introduce you

07:56.851 --> 07:59.020
to my old neighbor, John.

07:59.062 --> 08:01.273
He's the head of admissions

07:59.062 --> 08:01.273
at the Calder Academy

07:59.062 --> 08:01.273
in the Bronx.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.775
Calder? That's the best

08:01.315 --> 08:03.775
elementary school in the city.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.320
Their mock trial team gets

08:03.817 --> 08:06.320
hired to work real cases.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.196
And, Chuck, my friend from

08:06.361 --> 08:08.196
Major Crimes is here.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.198
-You're gonna love him.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.198
-Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.825
Well, uh, come on.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.825
Let's go.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.452
-Oh, let me talk your coat.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.452
-No! I need it.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.120
Oh. This way.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.663
All right, I know what's

08:15.162 --> 08:16.663
going on here.

08:16.704 --> 08:18.081
You two still don't

08:16.704 --> 08:18.081
trust Captain Kim,

08:18.123 --> 08:19.666
and you're here

08:18.123 --> 08:19.666
to snoop on her.

08:19.707 --> 08:20.834
I don't know what

08:19.707 --> 08:20.834
you're talking about.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.627
Please.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.627
Look at your shoes.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.546
You only wear sneakers

08:22.669 --> 08:25.546
for their literal purpose:

08:22.669 --> 08:25.546
sneaking.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.882
That's crazy. He's wearing

08:25.588 --> 08:27.882
perfectly normal--

08:27.924 --> 08:29.301
No, she's right.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.635
The clown shoes

08:29.343 --> 08:30.635
gave me away.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.887
OK, look, Captain Kim

08:30.677 --> 08:32.887
lied to us.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.806
There's something in

08:32.929 --> 08:34.806
this house that proves

08:32.929 --> 08:34.806
she's been conspiring

08:34.848 --> 08:36.641
with Madeline Wuntch,

08:34.848 --> 08:36.641
and we're gonna find it.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.519
[sighs]

08:36.683 --> 08:39.519
I am not letting you

08:36.683 --> 08:39.519
snoop around in her stuff

08:39.560 --> 08:40.812
and ruin this party.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.814
Oh, OK. Well, good luck

08:40.854 --> 08:42.814
trying to stop us.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.441
Oh-ho-ho, Jake.

08:44.483 --> 08:46.443
You don't know who you're

08:44.483 --> 08:46.443
dealing with, do you?

08:46.485 --> 08:50.113
I was student chaperone

08:46.485 --> 08:50.113
at every dance from

08:46.485 --> 08:50.113
middle school on.

08:50.155 --> 08:52.240
I've stopped more horny

08:50.155 --> 08:52.240
teenagers from making out

08:52.282 --> 08:54.034
to Savage Garden

08:52.282 --> 08:54.034
than you can count.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.411
Cool story, but we're

08:54.075 --> 08:56.411
not horny teens.

08:56.453 --> 08:57.745
We're horny adults.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.873
And tonight we're

08:57.787 --> 08:59.873
goin' all the way.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.791
Come on, Holt,

08:59.914 --> 09:01.791
let's shake this narc.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.460
[Amy]

09:01.833 --> 09:03.460
That's right, I am a NARC--

09:03.502 --> 09:06.046
a Nationally Accredited

09:03.502 --> 09:06.046
and Registered Chaperone!

09:06.087 --> 09:07.422
So what grade are

09:06.087 --> 09:07.422
your daughters in?

09:07.464 --> 09:09.257
They're in sixth grade.

09:09.299 --> 09:12.635
Oh, wait, I'm sorry,

09:09.299 --> 09:12.635
that's their reading level.

09:12.677 --> 09:13.928
They're in second.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.014
Wow. They sound

09:13.970 --> 09:16.014
quite impressive.

09:16.056 --> 09:19.267
Oh good, the food.

09:16.056 --> 09:19.267
I'm starving.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.728
-Hello, Detective Jeffords.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.728
-Do I know you?

09:21.769 --> 09:25.273
Ronald Palmer.

09:21.769 --> 09:25.273
You arrested me

09:21.769 --> 09:25.273
ten years ago.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.734
-You testified at my trial.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.734
-Oh, heeeey!

09:27.775 --> 09:29.777
-What have you been up to?

09:27.775 --> 09:29.777
-Prison.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.612
Prison, yeah.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.612
I shouldn't have asked.

09:31.654 --> 09:35.116
I spent ten long years thinking

09:31.654 --> 09:35.116
about what I would do

09:35.158 --> 09:37.244
if I ever saw you again.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.370
Lettuce cup?

09:38.412 --> 09:41.164
Uh...

09:41.206 --> 09:43.624
Oh. Do you think I'm

09:41.206 --> 09:43.624
trying to poison you?

09:43.666 --> 09:46.336
Am I always gonna be

09:43.666 --> 09:46.336
a criminal in your eyes

09:46.378 --> 09:48.004
even though I've

09:46.378 --> 09:48.004
served my time?

09:48.046 --> 09:49.339
No, no, no.

09:49.381 --> 09:50.798
I'm just not hungry

09:49.381 --> 09:50.798
right now.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.217
Oh, you said you

09:50.840 --> 09:52.217
were starving.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.761
Yes, John. Thanks for

09:52.259 --> 09:54.761
reminding me, John.

09:54.802 --> 09:57.347
All right here we go,

09:54.802 --> 09:57.347
approaching the mail...

09:57.389 --> 10:01.101
stay cool, and... doink.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.144
Now we've just got

10:01.142 --> 10:03.144
to find a private place

10:01.142 --> 10:03.144
to look at these.

10:03.186 --> 10:05.855
Through here to

10:03.186 --> 10:05.855
the guest bath.

10:05.897 --> 10:08.442
-Ahh!

10:05.897 --> 10:08.442
-Seriously?

10:05.897 --> 10:08.442
The bathroom sneak-off?

10:08.483 --> 10:12.070
It didn't work for Dana McAlpin

10:08.483 --> 10:12.070
trying to smoke a joint

10:08.483 --> 10:12.070
at the Winter Carnival Dance,

10:12.112 --> 10:13.696
and it's not gonna

10:12.112 --> 10:13.696
work for you.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.907
Gimme the mail.

10:15.949 --> 10:21.788
Hmm, you just got

10:15.949 --> 10:21.788
chaperoned--

10:15.949 --> 10:21.788
O-W-N-E-D.

10:22.914 --> 10:24.040
Spelling is never cool.

10:24.082 --> 10:26.126
Wrong, that was

10:24.082 --> 10:26.126
extremely cool.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.378
Now I understand why

10:26.167 --> 10:28.378
you're into her.

10:28.420 --> 10:31.590
Now you understand?

10:28.420 --> 10:31.590
You officiated our wedding.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.841
Whatever. We need to

10:31.631 --> 10:33.841
figure out a way

10:31.631 --> 10:33.841
to get her off our tail.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.843
-Good luck with that.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.843
-Ahh!

10:35.885 --> 10:37.678
What are you two

10:35.885 --> 10:37.678
doing over here,

10:37.720 --> 10:40.014
waiting for the caterers

10:37.720 --> 10:40.014
before they make their

10:37.720 --> 10:40.014
way into the crowd?

10:40.056 --> 10:41.558
We're snooping on

10:40.056 --> 10:41.558
Captain Kim,

10:41.600 --> 10:43.477
but let me guess:

10:41.600 --> 10:43.477
she seduced you as well.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.853
-Is she doing that to people?

10:43.518 --> 10:45.853
-Not literally.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.981
Oh, Michael! Norm! I didn't

10:45.895 --> 10:47.981
realize you arrived.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.400
Come with me,

10:48.022 --> 10:50.400
I want to make

10:48.022 --> 10:50.400
an introduction.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.360
[whispers]

10:50.442 --> 10:52.360
Don't worry, Jake.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.360
You're our friend.

10:52.402 --> 10:55.572
We're on your side no matter--

10:52.402 --> 10:55.572
Holy crap!

10:55.614 --> 10:57.198
Look at those chairs!

10:57.240 --> 10:58.658
I know you two

10:57.240 --> 10:58.658
like to sit,

10:58.699 --> 11:00.410
and these are the most

10:58.699 --> 11:00.410
comfortable chairs ever.

11:00.452 --> 11:01.786
Give 'em a try.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.497
[both]

11:01.828 --> 11:03.497
Ooh!

11:03.538 --> 11:04.956
It's like there's something

11:03.538 --> 11:04.956
great at this party

11:04.998 --> 11:06.458
for everyone, even me.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.294
She's serving my favorite

11:06.500 --> 11:09.294
dessert: carrots.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.088
Wait a minute. That's it.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.088
If there's something

11:09.336 --> 11:12.088
great for everyone,

11:12.130 --> 11:14.633
there's something

11:12.130 --> 11:14.633
great for the narc.

11:14.673 --> 11:17.344
Babe. Hi! How are you

11:14.673 --> 11:17.344
enjoying the party?

11:17.385 --> 11:19.596
Trying to chat me up?

11:17.385 --> 11:19.596
It won't work.

11:19.638 --> 11:22.557
Chaperone code forbids

11:19.638 --> 11:22.557
fraternization

11:19.638 --> 11:22.557
with chaperonees.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.518
OK, fine, I'll just leave

11:22.599 --> 11:24.518
you alone, then.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.936
I really quickly did

11:24.559 --> 11:26.936
want to introduce you

11:24.559 --> 11:26.936
to someone, though.

11:26.978 --> 11:29.314
This is Margo.

11:26.978 --> 11:29.314
She's a friend of

11:26.978 --> 11:29.314
Captain Kim's,

11:29.356 --> 11:32.233
-and apparently she invented

11:29.356 --> 11:32.233
a new type of binder.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.233
-What?

11:32.275 --> 11:33.818
"New type of binder"

11:32.275 --> 11:33.818
seems reductive.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.403
Would you call a car

11:33.860 --> 11:35.403
a new kind of horse?

11:35.445 --> 11:37.656
-No.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.656
-This is the future

11:35.445 --> 11:37.656
of organization.

11:37.696 --> 11:39.073
Oh, my God.

11:37.696 --> 11:39.073
Tell me everything.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.159
And you have been

11:39.115 --> 11:41.159
chaper-powned.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.952
-What?

11:41.201 --> 11:42.952
-Nothing. Love you. Binders.

11:42.994 --> 11:45.539
So Cap tells me you're

11:42.994 --> 11:45.539
in "Major Crimes."

11:45.580 --> 11:48.291
Yeah, workin'

11:45.580 --> 11:48.291
something big.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.378
Can't tell you who

11:49.543 --> 11:51.378
the target is,

11:51.419 --> 11:53.754
but let's just say he's done

11:51.419 --> 11:53.754
a bunch of disturbing things,

11:53.796 --> 11:54.881
and he's on

11:53.796 --> 11:54.881
the Yankees.

11:54.922 --> 11:56.090
[whistles]

11:56.132 --> 11:57.884
You play poker?

11:57.925 --> 12:00.428
Eh, used to. Got tired

11:57.925 --> 12:00.428
of winning all the time.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.597
[chuckles]

12:00.470 --> 12:02.597
Well, I have a

12:00.470 --> 12:02.597
weekly game.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.559
It's mostly Broadway stars

12:02.639 --> 12:05.559
and celebrity chefs,

12:05.600 --> 12:09.062
not exactly my crowd, but

12:05.600 --> 12:09.062
they are high rollers.

12:09.103 --> 12:11.022
Spot opened up;

12:09.103 --> 12:11.022
you want in?

12:11.064 --> 12:14.234
I don't know, seems kind of

12:11.064 --> 12:14.234
lame, but I'll stop by.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.860
[clicks tongue]

12:15.902 --> 12:17.320
[woman]

12:15.902 --> 12:17.320
Excuse me.

12:17.362 --> 12:18.613
I know you from somewhere.

12:18.655 --> 12:19.906
Do you go to my gym?

12:19.947 --> 12:21.949
Oh, nah. I work out

12:19.947 --> 12:21.949
in my garage,

12:21.991 --> 12:23.368
throw the tire around,

12:23.410 --> 12:25.786
grab a couple big

12:23.410 --> 12:25.786
ropes and do this.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.499
Mm-hmm.

12:29.541 --> 12:30.791
Here's my number.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.877
Maybe I could come

12:30.833 --> 12:32.877
over some time and--

12:32.919 --> 12:35.547
I don't know--

12:32.919 --> 12:35.547
you could work<i> me</i> out.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.261
OK, we've got her

12:39.426 --> 12:41.261
meeting the mayor,

12:41.302 --> 12:43.762
her dog-sitting for Bo Obama,

12:41.302 --> 12:43.762
Malala giving her an award,

12:43.804 --> 12:45.640
but no photos of Wuntch.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.183
That's because vampires

12:45.682 --> 12:47.183
don't appear on film.

12:47.225 --> 12:48.351
Perhaps we should

12:47.225 --> 12:48.351
be looking for

12:48.393 --> 12:50.478
a 17th-century woodblock print.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.898
Good idea.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.898
Let's keep movin'.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.484
-[Captain Kim] Hello?

12:53.940 --> 12:56.484
-She's coming. Hide.

12:56.526 --> 12:57.902
Title of your

12:56.526 --> 12:57.902
sex tape?

12:57.944 --> 12:59.654
In here.

13:00.655 --> 13:03.700
Hello.

13:00.655 --> 13:03.700
Is anyone up here?

13:10.248 --> 13:11.958
[lock clicks]

13:18.005 --> 13:20.841
Well, looks like we

13:18.005 --> 13:20.841
just found the key

13:20.883 --> 13:22.885
to exposing Captain Kim.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.846
It's the key that's

13:24.429 --> 13:25.846
in her pocket.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.848
Yes, obviously that's

13:25.888 --> 13:27.848
what I meant.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.563
We need to get that key.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.563
How are you at picking pockets?

13:33.605 --> 13:35.064
Does this answer

13:33.605 --> 13:35.064
your question?

13:35.106 --> 13:36.608
-Whose wallet is that?

13:35.106 --> 13:36.608
-It's mine.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.318
But it came out so smooth

13:36.650 --> 13:38.318
I barely even felt it.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.069
All right, fine,

13:38.359 --> 13:40.069
I'm terrible

13:38.359 --> 13:40.069
at pickpocketing.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.738
But if she was distracted,

13:40.111 --> 13:41.738
I bet I could pull it off.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.157
Maybe you could create

13:41.780 --> 13:44.157
a drunken scene or something?

13:44.198 --> 13:47.494
Why? What would

13:44.198 --> 13:47.494
my motivation be

13:44.198 --> 13:47.494
for such poor behavior?

13:47.535 --> 13:48.703
I don't know. Anything.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.829
No, I need something

13:48.745 --> 13:50.829
to draw from.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.624
Have I had a row

13:50.871 --> 13:52.624
with Kevin?

13:52.666 --> 13:53.916
Did something happen

13:52.666 --> 13:53.916
to Cheddar?

13:53.958 --> 13:56.085
Has a new captain

13:53.958 --> 13:56.085
moved into my precinct,

13:56.127 --> 13:58.879
usurped my position, and won

13:56.127 --> 13:58.879
the affection and admiration

13:58.921 --> 14:01.633
of people I've spent

13:58.921 --> 14:01.633
the last seven years

13:58.921 --> 14:01.633
building relationships with,

14:01.675 --> 14:04.969
people I once considered

14:01.675 --> 14:04.969
my chosen family,

14:05.011 --> 14:07.180
whom I foolheartedly

14:05.011 --> 14:07.180
hoped would provide me

14:07.221 --> 14:10.391
the unconditional love

14:07.221 --> 14:10.391
and support that I never got

14:10.433 --> 14:12.185
from my own

14:10.433 --> 14:12.185
flesh and blood?

14:13.770 --> 14:15.188
I think you should go

14:13.770 --> 14:15.188
with the last one.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.064
-That last one

14:15.229 --> 14:17.064
seemed good. Yeah.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.064
-Yeah.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.441
This is the best

14:17.106 --> 14:18.441
night of my life.

14:18.483 --> 14:19.859
People believe I work

14:18.483 --> 14:19.859
out with ropes,

14:19.900 --> 14:21.778
a mega-babe hit on me,

14:21.820 --> 14:23.571
and the bartender didn't

14:21.820 --> 14:23.571
assume I just wanted a

14:21.820 --> 14:23.571
Bay Breeze.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.198
Hey, you-- cool guy!

14:25.239 --> 14:27.074
Were you flirting with

14:25.239 --> 14:27.074
my girlfriend out back?

14:27.116 --> 14:29.160
Calm down, hotshot.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.160
I'm taken.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.245
Look, I'll throw away

14:29.202 --> 14:31.245
her number.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.581
That's it, you

14:31.287 --> 14:33.581
and me outside!

14:33.623 --> 14:35.208
Oh, brother.

14:35.249 --> 14:38.002
Come on, guys.

14:35.249 --> 14:38.002
I gotta go squash this bug.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.630
Of course, at Calder

14:38.044 --> 14:40.630
we're not just looking

14:38.044 --> 14:40.630
for good students.

14:40.672 --> 14:42.632
We want compassionate

14:40.672 --> 14:42.632
members of the community.

14:42.674 --> 14:46.344
Great. Terry has a passion

14:42.674 --> 14:46.344
for compassion.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.471
-Turkey pinwheel?

14:46.386 --> 14:48.471
-Oh, you're back again.

14:48.513 --> 14:51.057
You seem to working

14:48.513 --> 14:51.057
this one spot a<i> lot.</i>

14:51.098 --> 14:53.184
Well, we're old friends,

14:51.098 --> 14:53.184
remember?

14:53.226 --> 14:55.729
I'll ask again:

14:53.226 --> 14:55.729
turkey pinwheel?

14:55.770 --> 14:56.771
Why is there just one?

14:56.813 --> 14:58.523
I made it special--

14:56.813 --> 14:58.523
for you.

14:58.565 --> 14:59.940
How is it special?

14:59.982 --> 15:02.402
There's a little

14:59.982 --> 15:02.402
something extra in it.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.195
Wait, are you still

15:02.443 --> 15:04.195
suspicious of me?

15:04.237 --> 15:06.364
You don't think I deserve

15:04.237 --> 15:06.364
a second chance?

15:06.406 --> 15:09.242
Impossible.

15:06.406 --> 15:09.242
Lieutenant Jeffords has

15:06.406 --> 15:09.242
a passion for compassion.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.035
Yeah, you're right.

15:11.077 --> 15:13.747
You know what?

15:11.077 --> 15:13.747
I will take this pinwheel.

15:14.789 --> 15:16.249
Mmm, delicious!

15:16.290 --> 15:17.751
[chuckling]

15:22.505 --> 15:25.842
Excuse me, does it seem

15:22.505 --> 15:25.842
slightly warm to anyone?

15:25.884 --> 15:29.262
I feel it is quite...<i> warm.</i>

15:29.303 --> 15:31.931
What was that?!

15:29.303 --> 15:31.931
You were supposed to

15:29.303 --> 15:31.931
cause a drunken scene.

15:31.972 --> 15:34.141
I was. I raised the

15:31.972 --> 15:34.141
volume of my voice 9%.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.976
as inebriated people do,

15:36.018 --> 15:38.979
<i>and</i> I spoke of the resultant

15:36.018 --> 15:38.979
rise in body temperature.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.231
Well, you need

15:39.021 --> 15:40.231
to do more.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.400
More than that?

15:40.273 --> 15:42.400
Pfft, OK.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.569
Oh, I love this song.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.195
Oh, I'll have

15:44.611 --> 15:46.195
one of those.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.822
<i>That</i> was more?!

15:47.864 --> 15:49.866
I paired a crab cake with

-like an animal.

15:49.908 --> 15:51.868
-OK, we need a new plan.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.453
No, no, I have

15:51.910 --> 15:53.453
just the thing.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.121
It's gonna be

15:53.494 --> 15:55.121
too small again.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.121
You have to really--

15:55.162 --> 15:56.790

15:55.162 --> 15:56.790
myself down the stairs.

15:56.831 --> 15:59.125
Ahh! Augh!

16:04.130 --> 16:06.674
No need. I'm fine.

Look, man, I don't

She's gonna leave me,

16:11.805 --> 16:12.972
Oh. You're<i> crying?</i>

Of course she wants

16:14.682 --> 16:15.975
You're so cool.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.685

16:16.016 --> 16:17.685
-What's your secret?

16:17.727 --> 16:20.146
How can I become

16:17.727 --> 16:20.146
more like you?

16:21.815 --> 16:24.400
Here. This is all

16:21.815 --> 16:24.400
you need.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.193
It'll change your life.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.193
Trust me.

16:30.281 --> 16:32.199
Did you just give away

16:30.281 --> 16:32.199
your magic jacket?

16:32.241 --> 16:34.201
Oh, Terry, it wasn't

16:32.241 --> 16:34.201
the jacket.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.371
I realize now that

16:34.243 --> 16:37.371
Chuck was in here.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.833
I've had another man deep

16:37.413 --> 16:39.833
inside me this whole time.

16:39.874 --> 16:42.168
-Welcome back, Charles.

16:39.874 --> 16:42.168
-Oh, right away?

16:42.209 --> 16:44.044
It was the jacket!

16:58.184 --> 17:01.228
Now let's see if you do

16:58.184 --> 17:01.228
know Madeline Wuntch.

17:20.456 --> 17:22.041
Oh, I see what happened.

He went downstairs

17:22.082 --> 17:23.877
and killed everyone else.

17:23.918 --> 17:26.086
Phew.

17:23.918 --> 17:26.086
That worked out.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.653
Terry, are you OK?

17:50.695 --> 17:52.446
I'm fine. But that dog

17:50.695 --> 17:52.446
came right at me.

17:52.488 --> 17:53.907
And I have no idea why!

17:53.948 --> 17:55.825
It looked like you had a lot

17:53.948 --> 17:55.825
of food in your pockets.

17:55.867 --> 17:58.953
<i>What?</i> No.

17:55.867 --> 17:58.953
That's not true.

17:58.995 --> 18:00.454
This jacket never had

17:58.995 --> 18:00.454
any pockets.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.916
-This is the style.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.916
-Oh, my God.

18:02.957 --> 18:04.959
You did think I was

18:02.957 --> 18:04.959
poisoning you.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.794
I mean, you were the

18:05.001 --> 18:06.794
one who said he spent

18:06.836 --> 18:08.922
every day in prison dreaming

18:06.836 --> 18:08.922
of the day we'd meet again.

18:08.963 --> 18:11.173
So I could prove

18:08.963 --> 18:11.173
to you I'd changed!

18:11.215 --> 18:13.927
-You said you put something

extra in my food!

18:11.215 --> 18:13.927
-Love!

18:13.968 --> 18:15.219
Well, you said

18:13.968 --> 18:15.219
it so creepy.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.055
Look, tone is everything, man.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.806
I've been talking to

18:17.096 --> 18:18.806

18:18.848 --> 18:20.516

18:20.558 --> 18:23.519
I'm sorry if my social skills

That is a really

18:23.561 --> 18:25.563
good explanation.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.356
Everybody, the dog is

18:25.605 --> 18:27.356
leashed up out back.

18:27.398 --> 18:28.566
Did anyone get hurt?

Eh, it was nothing.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.699
penetrate the jacket.

No.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.045
Everybody, I am so, so sorry.

18:49.087 --> 18:50.838
I don't understand

18:49.087 --> 18:50.838
how Linus got out.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.256
I had him locked upstairs

18:50.880 --> 18:52.256
in my bedroom.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.383
I have the key right here.

18:54.425 --> 18:58.262
Wait, where's the key?

18:58.304 --> 19:00.974
All right, quit

18:58.304 --> 19:00.974
joking around, guys.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.974
Who's got the key?

19:01.015 --> 19:02.892
You broke

19:01.015 --> 19:02.892
into my bedroom?

19:02.934 --> 19:04.560
Well, this wouldn't

19:02.934 --> 19:04.560
have been a problem

19:02.934 --> 19:04.560
if didn't she have

19:04.602 --> 19:06.186
a vicious guard dog that's

19:04.602 --> 19:06.186
protecting her secrets.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.355
Linus is not a guard dog,

19:06.228 --> 19:08.355
and he's not vicious.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.858
He was locked in my room

19:08.397 --> 19:10.858
because he gets skittish

19:08.397 --> 19:10.858
around crowds.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.652
I just rescued him from

19:10.900 --> 19:12.652
a dog-fighting ring.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.946
-[all] Awwwww.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.946
-Don't "aww" her, all right?

19:14.988 --> 19:16.781
She's a liar,

19:14.988 --> 19:16.781
and I have proof.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.491
Remember how she said she

19:16.823 --> 19:18.491
didn't know Madeline Wuntch?

19:18.532 --> 19:20.284
Well, then explain why

19:18.532 --> 19:20.284
she has an email from her

19:20.326 --> 19:23.913
-dated two weeks ago,

19:20.326 --> 19:23.913
subject: Raymond Holt.

19:20.326 --> 19:23.913
-Mm-hmm.

19:23.955 --> 19:26.332
Peralta, why don't you

19:23.955 --> 19:26.332
read that email aloud

19:23.955 --> 19:26.332
for everyone?

19:26.373 --> 19:28.584
Oh, you'd love that,

19:26.373 --> 19:28.584
wouldn't you? Wait a minute.

19:26.373 --> 19:28.584
Why would you love that?

19:28.626 --> 19:29.919
This is gonna be bad

19:28.626 --> 19:29.919
for me, isn't it?

19:28.626 --> 19:29.919
Amy, you read it.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.129
-No.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.129
-I'll do it, Jakey.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.546
Oh, the old Charles is back.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.381
"Julia, we've never

19:32.588 --> 19:34.381
spoken..."

19:34.423 --> 19:36.050
Mm-hmm, four words in,

19:34.423 --> 19:36.050
and it's already pretty

19:34.423 --> 19:36.050
bad for me.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.718
"But your transfer to the

19:36.092 --> 19:37.718
Nine-Nine is a foolish one.

But in recognition of your

19:40.763 --> 19:42.974
exemplary service,

19:43.016 --> 19:44.767
I will honor your wishes.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.767

19:44.809 --> 19:46.936
But then why<i> are</i> you

19:44.809 --> 19:46.936
at the Nine-Nine?

19:46.978 --> 19:49.105
-I'm here for you.

19:46.978 --> 19:49.105
-Aha!

19:49.147 --> 19:50.230
Because you're my hero.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.524
Oof. I am off today.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.651
You overcame so much

19:51.565 --> 19:53.651
to become a captain.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.112
It made me feel like I could

19:53.693 --> 19:56.112
accomplish anything.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.948
So when the chance came

19:56.154 --> 19:58.948
up to work with you,

19:56.154 --> 19:58.948
I jumped at it.

19:58.990 --> 20:00.616
But why not just

19:58.990 --> 20:00.616
tell me that?

20:00.658 --> 20:02.535
Because you were so down

20:00.658 --> 20:02.535
about being in uniform,

20:02.576 --> 20:03.953
I didn't want it to

20:02.576 --> 20:03.953
come across as pity.

20:03.995 --> 20:07.957
Ah, well, what a sweet

20:03.995 --> 20:07.957
and thoughtful moment,

20:07.999 --> 20:10.292
which would not have

20:07.999 --> 20:10.292
been possible without

20:07.999 --> 20:10.292
my meddling.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.128
How dare you try to

20:10.334 --> 20:12.128
weasel out of this

20:12.170 --> 20:14.130
when the love of my

20:12.170 --> 20:14.130
life is splattered

20:12.170 --> 20:14.130
all over that room.

20:14.172 --> 20:15.923
-The chair?

20:14.172 --> 20:15.923
-Get her name out

20:14.172 --> 20:15.923
of your mouth!

20:15.965 --> 20:18.676
-Her name is "the chair"?

20:15.965 --> 20:18.676
-I warned you!

20:18.718 --> 20:21.595
So you think things will be

20:18.718 --> 20:21.595
weird with Captain Kim?

20:21.637 --> 20:24.264
Nah, she's so perfect.

20:21.637 --> 20:24.264
I'm sure she's already

20:21.637 --> 20:24.264
moved past it,

20:24.306 --> 20:25.474
and we'll have a

20:24.306 --> 20:25.474
great year together.

20:25.516 --> 20:27.309
-Yeah.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.395
Captain Kim asked

20:27.351 --> 20:29.395
for an immediate transfer.

20:29.436 --> 20:31.522
She is no longer

20:29.436 --> 20:31.522
part of the Nine-Nine.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.066
-What?

20:31.564 --> 20:33.066
-She said she respected you all,

20:33.107 --> 20:35.359
but there was obviously

20:33.107 --> 20:35.359
too much history here,

20:35.401 --> 20:36.903
and she'd always feel

20:35.401 --> 20:36.903
like an interloper.

20:36.944 --> 20:38.362
Oh, man, you guys.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.989
I almost feel like

20:38.404 --> 20:39.989
this is all my fault.

20:40.031 --> 20:40.990
-Agreed.

20:40.031 --> 20:40.990
-What?

20:41.032 --> 20:42.282
You encouraged me.

20:42.324 --> 20:43.701
You kept saying, "Mm-hmm."

20:43.743 --> 20:45.369
I was going through

20:43.743 --> 20:45.369
something difficult.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.495
You have no excuse.

20:46.537 --> 20:47.955
He's kind of right,

20:46.537 --> 20:47.955
Jake.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.540
-What was going on there?

20:47.997 --> 20:49.540
-I don't know.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.709
I guess I'm just

20:49.582 --> 20:51.709
overly paranoid

20:51.751 --> 20:53.335
from everything that's

20:51.751 --> 20:53.335
happened here, you know,

20:53.377 --> 20:55.088
with Kelly and Wuntch

20:53.377 --> 20:55.088
and Trevor and Rolf.

20:55.129 --> 20:56.714
-Who's Rolf?

20:55.129 --> 20:56.714
-Oh, mom my dated Rolf

20:56.756 --> 20:58.424
after she broke up with Trevor.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.593
He was also a limo driver,

20:58.465 --> 21:00.593
and he also cheated on her.

21:00.634 --> 21:03.721
[gasps]

21:00.634 --> 21:03.721
The problem is with

21:00.634 --> 21:03.721
limo drivers!

21:03.763 --> 21:04.722
-Babe, it's not.

21:03.763 --> 21:04.722
-It's not?

21:04.764 --> 21:05.806
-No.

21:04.764 --> 21:05.806
-OK, thanks. I love you.

21:05.848 --> 21:06.974
[Terry]

21:05.848 --> 21:06.974
Look, man, I get it.

21:07.016 --> 21:08.308
There's no question

21:08.350 --> 21:09.936
we've been burned

21:08.350 --> 21:09.936
a bunch as squad.

21:09.977 --> 21:11.478
But you not giving someone

21:09.977 --> 21:11.478
the benefit of the doubt

21:11.520 --> 21:12.939
cost us a good captain!

21:12.980 --> 21:14.065
I know. You're right.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.315
Look, I'm really sorry.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.026
But your heart was

21:15.357 --> 21:17.026
in the right place.

21:17.068 --> 21:19.779
And I had to pay Captain Kim,

21:17.068 --> 21:19.779
like, $3700 in damages.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.405
-You did what?!

21:19.820 --> 21:21.405
-The point is,

21:21.447 --> 21:22.740
everyone accepted my apology,

21:21.447 --> 21:22.740
Amy, right, Charles?

21:22.782 --> 21:24.117
-You betcha, Jakey.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.117
-See?

21:24.158 --> 21:25.993
<i>Fremulon</i>

21:26.035 --> 21:28.287
<i>-Not a doctor.</i>

21:26.035 --> 21:28.287
-Shh.
